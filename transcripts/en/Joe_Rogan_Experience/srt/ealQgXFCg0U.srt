1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,290
Oh Shit. Here we go. Recording.
Oh, you know what? What?

2
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:07,890
Okay, go ahead. Go ahead. We're done.

3
00:00:07,891 --> 00:00:11,400
So many goddamn enemies on
boiler fucking Gracie. I,

4
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:16,050
we don't know. Fuck that. Yes,
we're broadcasting right now.

5
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:19,290
The Joe Rogan experience podcast is
brought to you by the flashlight.

6
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:24,310
If you go to Joe, who was that? Oh,
so you, Brian, you goddamn rookie son.

7
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:25,440
Uh,

8
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:28,890
if you go to Joe rogan.net and click on
the link for the flashlight and enter in

9
00:00:28,891 --> 00:00:29,730
the code name Brogan,

10
00:00:29,731 --> 00:00:33,930
you get 15% off of the
number one sex toy for men.

11
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:39,090
Ah Ha. And with that said, oh,

12
00:00:39,091 --> 00:00:43,550
the black guy,
you're a gentle,

13
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:47,520
just sound today. Are there people that
are on the fence about the fleshlight?

14
00:00:47,521 --> 00:00:50,670
But that 15% I was like, you know, when
I heard the 15% I just jumped on it.

15
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:54,000
Like maybe, maybe there's a few
frugal master bars out there.

16
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:57,120
Ignore 15% fucking off.
That never makes a difference.

17
00:00:57,121 --> 00:01:01,380
Even when I was broke ass motherfucker,
15% off, never meant really? It. Never,

18
00:01:01,381 --> 00:01:05,370
not 15 didn't mean I ain't gonna make me
get up out of my fucking chair and call

19
00:01:05,371 --> 00:01:06,480
somebody in order some shoes.

20
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,080
Well they made me 30 Penn,
I'm a member of,

21
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:13,490
I'm a member of all the coupon websites
and if I had a flashlight web 15% off.

22
00:01:13,491 --> 00:01:16,610
Fuck yeah, I'm like free shipping,
you know. That to me is like,

23
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,230
oh I got extra free something.

24
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:23,020
Whoa, okay. I think everybody thinks
differently when it comes to money.

25
00:01:23,021 --> 00:01:26,170
I think you're a lot like me and that you
would rather not think about it at all.

26
00:01:26,171 --> 00:01:29,040
I don't want to think about thinking
about it as much as you have to. I'm like,

27
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:33,820
well how much is it? Would you
consider yourself? To be honest,

28
00:01:33,821 --> 00:01:38,440
it's totally cool. Would you
consider yourself a really
big tipper? Yes. Oh really?

29
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:43,180
Yeah, like 20% the coupons. I don't know
that many of the guys in the coupons,

30
00:01:43,181 --> 00:01:45,780
but usually guys that are in the
coupons usually generally don't tip

31
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,050
well. I, I consider it more of
like that's human and you know,

32
00:01:49,051 --> 00:01:54,030
like I'm helping somebody out compared to
like, fuck if I can get $20 off Amazon,

33
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:57,510
I'm going to do that. Fucking Amazon
in the ass. Yeah. Or you know,

34
00:01:57,511 --> 00:01:59,820
Amazon's actually hooking you
up and giving you a way to make,

35
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:04,870
what is the reason for coupons? I mean,
is it just to see what happens when,

36
00:02:04,871 --> 00:02:07,110
when they offer people less
money for things? Well,

37
00:02:07,111 --> 00:02:08,760
I don't know what the
grocery stores have changed.

38
00:02:08,761 --> 00:02:11,100
They used to be relying on coupons.
Now if you don't,

39
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:13,230
if you go to a grocery store
without one of those cards,

40
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:17,310
you're pretty much paying a good 15 20%
more than you would if you didn't have a

41
00:02:17,311 --> 00:02:20,740
card on here. What's the benefit
in that for them? Because for, uh,

42
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:25,560
for those people that aren't loyal,
they just come in and just spend money and

43
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:28,270
I think a charge him arms advertising.

44
00:02:28,271 --> 00:02:31,600
When you put up a billboard and
it said call now 15%. It's just,

45
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,830
it doesn't mean shit to them.

46
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:37,240
It's just a reason to have an ad like
that will have like a storyline for an ad.

47
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:41,080
So let's just say 15% off, we'll blow
that up. It doesn't really matter.

48
00:02:41,081 --> 00:02:44,320
It's a reason to get the logo out.
That's makes sense.

49
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:46,500
So sort of like an advertising move.
Yeah,

50
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:49,880
but I've always thought it was probably
to see like maybe our shit's too

51
00:02:49,881 --> 00:02:50,481
expensive.

52
00:02:50,481 --> 00:02:54,590
Maybe we could actually make more money
if we sold more of them at a lesser

53
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:56,960
price.
Probably also averages out.

54
00:02:56,961 --> 00:03:00,220
Like if you have a product that's
$20 but you could also charge

55
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,330
$30 for it,

56
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,510
then the average is at the people that
use the coupons would probably make it

57
00:03:04,511 --> 00:03:08,460
more like 25 economics major right now.
Pull it is fucking hair out.

58
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:12,400
Usually know what you're talking
about. I know. By the way,

59
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:17,070
did we say this is Eddie Bravo Ramos.
We opened the show with coupon.

60
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:21,100
Your,
it's a new day are he's not even here.

61
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:28,360
I've never been one to, whenever I
go to Ralph's or something like that.

62
00:03:28,361 --> 00:03:31,560
And they always said, Ralph's our
local supermarket. Do you want to? Uh,

63
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:36,370
do you want to have a Ralph's Card
fucking card? I don't want another car.

64
00:03:36,371 --> 00:03:40,690
I have a free shake on a roll backs card
or something. I'll just throw that away.

65
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,630
You guys.
So not good with coupons.

66
00:03:43,631 --> 00:03:48,100
They're keeping all that stuff in
a little bag. Different mindset.

67
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:51,790
Eddie and I have this,
it's a modified stoner mindset.

68
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:53,950
We get a lot of shit done.

69
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,890
But you and I are both the same way in
that if we don't have to think about

70
00:03:56,891 --> 00:03:58,330
something,
I'm not going to think about it.

71
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:02,190
And if it's not going to make a
difference in my life, I'm not,

72
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:05,900
not gonna physically, physically
feel the difference. Come on now.

73
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:11,500
I need to do that. I guess in certain
for the goods, man, it helps you.

74
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:13,710
You need to like save money.
Yeah.

75
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:17,230
I need to make sure if you just didn't
smoke fucking cigarettes, cancer boy,

76
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:19,960
just throw those fucking things away.
You'd have a lot of extra money.

77
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:23,200
That's a terrible fucking
drug, man. You know I,

78
00:04:23,201 --> 00:04:24,650
that was the number one
thing when everybody,

79
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:28,420
anyone ever talks anything about
politicians caring. I just say,

80
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:30,580
why the fuck don't they
ever talk about cigarettes?

81
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:33,970
What was the last time you heard Obama
talk about everyone should quit smoking?

82
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:38,230
Getting on TV, talking about the
400,000 people. Sure. But it doesn't,

83
00:04:38,231 --> 00:04:41,230
you try to quit or hasn't he tried
to quit? Everyone has. You know what?

84
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:43,330
I'll be honest.
Every now and then I have a cigarette.

85
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:48,070
I don't have a problem with cigarettes.
You know, every now and then,

86
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:51,490
you know what it does when you get high
and you throw cigarette on top of that,

87
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:54,910
after five minutes you
get like a big head buzz.

88
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:57,820
That's pretty fucking cool. You've
been having those menthol cigarettes.

89
00:04:57,821 --> 00:05:02,200
I can tell I really liked cigars
and cigars are essentially,

90
00:05:02,201 --> 00:05:04,630
it's just pure nicotine that
you're smoking. You know, it's,

91
00:05:04,631 --> 00:05:07,720
this is probably the same buzz that you
get off of a cigarette and one way or

92
00:05:07,721 --> 00:05:12,400
another I don't recommend it,
but I have full control of my body.

93
00:05:12,401 --> 00:05:17,401
I've been drinking since I was 14 probably
younger than that and I never drink

94
00:05:17,441 --> 00:05:20,140
alone. I never, I'm not
an alcoholic. I don't,

95
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,400
I only drink in social situations. And
if I don't drink for four or five months,

96
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:28,930
you know, I'm not an alcoholic.
You rage hard in social situations.

97
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:34,030
I wrote a blog about you.
I'm a temporary drunk.

98
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,900
Yeah, well you, what you have is um, you,

99
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:41,470
you have the ability to control your
impulses and even though your impulses

100
00:05:41,471 --> 00:05:44,770
might be crazy, you know, you
have ability to put them in check.

101
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,580
Whereas a lot of people when they start
drinking and blackout and become another

102
00:05:48,581 --> 00:05:52,240
person, those people, they can't
just not do it again the next day.

103
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:54,670
The next day comes around.
They have a couple of drinks in them.

104
00:05:54,671 --> 00:05:58,040
They can't step aside. You
can stop at two drinks. How

105
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:02,390
about the pizza story and Phoenix are,
no. Yeah man, we were, we were out. Okay.

106
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:04,820
We were ham or 2005,

107
00:06:04,821 --> 00:06:09,050
2005 I did the Improv and Phoenix and
Tempe rather, we had a great old time,

108
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,590
went out, got our party on God, drink on.

109
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:16,220
We were hammered and we're at a pizza
place and it's two o'clock in the fucking

110
00:06:16,221 --> 00:06:20,690
morning and Eddie Bravo was on the
Atkins Diet. So he's blackout drunk,

111
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,060
blackout drunk.
And he still won't eat as crusts.

112
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:29,270
God rest his soul. Gracie, Tony
[inaudible] Harris way last year.

113
00:06:29,271 --> 00:06:30,830
I always fucking committed to that shit.

114
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:33,530
I also remember your cheat
day retake ridiculous.

115
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:37,520
It's hard to have a Sundae with
pizza inside of it. Chocolate sauce.

116
00:06:37,521 --> 00:06:40,130
Anything you can think of,
you're just dudes are famous for.

117
00:06:40,131 --> 00:06:43,520
The cheat days is a dude who trains with
Bj Penn. I Apologize, I forgot his name.

118
00:06:43,521 --> 00:06:47,060
He's a wrestler and he would put pictures
of his shit online cause it was so

119
00:06:47,061 --> 00:06:47,894
ridiculous.

120
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:52,010
He would go to Mcdonald's and get a
quarter pounder and then he would go to

121
00:06:52,011 --> 00:06:54,940
Krispy Kreme and it would cut a donut
in half and he put the cheeseburger in

122
00:06:54,941 --> 00:06:59,660
between the donut. Oh Man. He was
just fucking off some foods cheap.

123
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,170
When you're on the Atkins Diet
and you're restricting carbs,

124
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,580
you think about bread like every day.

125
00:07:04,581 --> 00:07:07,850
Sometimes you dream about Brad and you're
thinking about that Sunday and you're

126
00:07:07,851 --> 00:07:11,030
thinking, you're thinking about food
so much Wednesday. I'm like, damn,

127
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,400
all that matters to me. It's
just a couple more days. Hold on.

128
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:18,170
And I did it for almost three years where
I was looking forward to that Sunday.

129
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:22,070
Oh Man. And when I would wake up
and stuff my face and I'm like,

130
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:26,330
it's 11 o'clock in the morning,
I'm stuffed and it's my cheat day.

131
00:07:26,331 --> 00:07:28,970
I've been waiting for this all week.
I want to get hungry again.

132
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:32,630
That's our spoken a lot of pot getting
the cushiest of Kush. You ever grow up?

133
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:38,140
I'm sure I did. I mean you had to
have some of the Shit I saw you.

134
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:39,440
He was just ridiculous.

135
00:07:39,441 --> 00:07:43,790
I even know my fattest day never ate
and then I would extend it to Saturday

136
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:44,051
night.
I call,

137
00:07:44,051 --> 00:07:49,051
I'm going to start early and then for
like after a year I Saturday night and all

138
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:51,700
day Sunday?
Yes.

139
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:55,520
You waited till midnight and
then I did that for about a year.

140
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:59,230
I would start Saturday night and
midnight and just go off. Right.

141
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,650
And take it all the way through Sunday.

142
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:04,210
Dennis started Saturday afternoon
around six UFC, you know,

143
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:08,840
were eating before the UFC.
Okay. Then it just became,

144
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:12,100
let's just do Saturday and Sunday
and less. I think about it no more.

145
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:14,000
Let's just wake up Saturday,
fuck it,

146
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:18,200
and then when I added Friday
night that I was like,

147
00:08:18,201 --> 00:08:21,340
I love sitting off opposite cheat day.
I was like,

148
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:24,170
I'm not going to get crazy with it now.
I'm not going to suffer. And I'm like,

149
00:08:24,171 --> 00:08:26,970
well, it's not even making
a difference now. Yeah,

150
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:29,930
you were doing that for a long time.
I miss those days. That was fun.

151
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,010
You are so insane with it. I was
disciplined. Very disciplined. Yeah.

152
00:08:34,011 --> 00:08:36,770
You would just eat lettuce.
I remember you were eating bunny food.

153
00:08:36,771 --> 00:08:41,390
You were just eating and time.
People thought I lost so much weight.

154
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:42,230
People thought,

155
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:47,030
I remember at Abu Dhabi 2005 like people
on the Internet were saying that, man,

156
00:08:47,031 --> 00:08:47,741
is he a heroin?

157
00:08:47,741 --> 00:08:51,980
I because Enzo said something had Enzo
said something like on the Internet where

158
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:55,770
they thought I was on like drunk.
Will you growing your out then

159
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:59,130
you'll no, no. You haven't
done that yet? Nope. Nope.

160
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:03,510
It was hiking the way it is now and I
was really skinny and it was from the

161
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:06,900
Atkins Diet and people at Abu Dhabi
thought I was on heroin. That was,

162
00:09:06,901 --> 00:09:10,650
that's a true story. When people were on
underground talking Shit, oh he's, look,

163
00:09:10,651 --> 00:09:14,320
he's on heroin. It looks like shit.
Crazy thing is how much you train you.

164
00:09:14,321 --> 00:09:18,210
You train a lot, but you would eat
so bad that you would gain weight.

165
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,780
You would just go off of Burritos
and you would just go off.

166
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:26,160
So now I'm like on a diet like
part of the day, part of the day,

167
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:30,540
like w how much of the day?
A good 65 70% well,

168
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:33,150
as long as you just maintain,
you know,

169
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:36,090
it's when you let yourself go and then
you've got to get fucking skinny again.

170
00:09:36,091 --> 00:09:39,150
That's what happens with dudes and it was,
it happened with girls.

171
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:43,050
It happens with everybody. That's the
hardest thing is getting back in shape.

172
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,600
You know, it's not staying and shapes
they can shape is not that bad.

173
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:47,370
You get some momentum and keep it going.

174
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:50,640
The one thing to taught me a lot though
is my girlfriend cooks for me all the

175
00:09:50,641 --> 00:09:53,270
time now. She moved in, so we were,

176
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:57,930
I rarely go out before man in the
middle of Hollywood. I had choices.

177
00:09:57,931 --> 00:10:01,560
That was all night that we want Carl's Jr.
You Want Jack in the box?

178
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:04,410
You know you can get Wendy's all night.
You can,

179
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:07,890
there's so much taco bells right there.
You have so many choices in it.

180
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,470
All I gotta do is get in my car.
And what?

181
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:15,270
What got me fat was the
place I lived at before you,

182
00:10:15,271 --> 00:10:16,800
it was terrible parking.
You got to,

183
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:19,740
sometimes you have to punt four blocks
down the street just to get a parking.

184
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:22,350
So if I had a good parking
when I got home after Jujitsu,

185
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:24,510
I wouldn't been want to lose that parking.

186
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,140
It wasn't worth it that Carl's Jr
was not worth losing my parking.

187
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:31,860
But then once I got my old official
parking man, you can leave at anytime.

188
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:34,920
Just right there at three in the morning,
ready to go to your place.

189
00:10:34,921 --> 00:10:38,490
Used to be brutal for parking.
Yeah, I miss that shit.

190
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:41,460
How do people live like that? That
sucks. That's where live like that.

191
00:10:41,461 --> 00:10:44,610
And I'm thinking like what if he had to
poop really bad and you couldn't find a

192
00:10:44,611 --> 00:10:47,160
parking spot and you
always like champ pants.

193
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:48,750
It's like when we were
talking about with the,

194
00:10:48,751 --> 00:10:52,410
all the area around the Improv that
everywhere you go on those side streets,

195
00:10:52,411 --> 00:10:56,430
it's all residential only parking and
like you're literally not even allowed to

196
00:10:56,431 --> 00:10:59,790
park there. They just did just saying
sorry. Even though this is the street,

197
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:01,770
there's no room for regular people.

198
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:05,550
You have to live here to park your fucking
car here because we fucked up and we

199
00:11:05,551 --> 00:11:09,480
put too many people in one spot.
You can park. That's ridiculous man.

200
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:12,510
That's the worst thing in the world
above when you do sets and Hollywood.

201
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:15,360
I used to park my car in the Improv.

202
00:11:15,361 --> 00:11:19,200
I you still let the valet parking but
they let some fucking chick, she was,

203
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:22,650
she was drunk man and she
fucked up my car. She just,

204
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:24,870
she was pulling it out
of a spot and you know,

205
00:11:24,871 --> 00:11:28,140
it was a really tight little area and
she just turned her wheel and hit the gas

206
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:32,430
and just jacked my fucking car and she
didn't have no insurance and I'm like,

207
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:34,330
why am I letting these
people parked my car?

208
00:11:34,331 --> 00:11:37,760
And you're obviously not looking after
my shit. So I stopped doing that.

209
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:42,390
You know that that reminded me of back
in 2002 when you tore your knee and you

210
00:11:42,391 --> 00:11:46,740
couldn't drive your Nsx and I had
a driver, you were so mad at me,

211
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:50,940
it not a driver. He was really mad
at me. It wasn't really mad at you.

212
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:54,400
He kept like putting it
neutral on the highway

213
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:57,880
and then dropping it down and it was just
sex. It had a lot of horsepower, man.

214
00:11:57,881 --> 00:12:01,690
I wasn't just, I was driving
caravans and shit up to that point.

215
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:06,100
And Larry 1972 Ford curry and it was
so funny because I've never been seen

216
00:12:06,101 --> 00:12:09,670
someone so like breaking down
the effect of car has on girls,

217
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:13,000
his needs tor,
he's sitting in his car,

218
00:12:13,001 --> 00:12:16,870
I'm trying to help him and he's fucking,
he's got pain here and he's like fuck,

219
00:12:16,871 --> 00:12:20,690
he's grinding my clutch fucking
like locked up and it's,

220
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:24,820
I'm taking him to like emergencies,
not surgery.

221
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:28,930
We had to go to get an MRI.
The doctor gave me an MRI

222
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:32,680
immediately. We screaming on the top of
your lungs cause I fucked my knee up.

223
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:34,590
I was just,
this was the reading of tears.

224
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:37,030
I've had a bunch of different
knee injuries, but uh,

225
00:12:37,031 --> 00:12:40,450
the most painful one is ironically
the one that healed the quickest.

226
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:43,160
That's the meniscus one.
Once they did the meniscus surgery,

227
00:12:43,161 --> 00:12:44,980
it was like six weeks later
I was on the mat again.

228
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:49,330
But when I had my ACL torn both times,
it's not that painful.

229
00:12:49,331 --> 00:12:52,180
Not nearly as painful.
The meniscus is what's really painful.

230
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,750
The ACL just kind of snaps and it's
fucked and it hurts a little bit and then

231
00:12:55,751 --> 00:12:57,970
you can't move your legs wobbling.
Like what the fuck?

232
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,280
And then you go to a doctor and they go,
you don't have a ligament anymore.

233
00:13:00,281 --> 00:13:03,340
You have to get an artificial ligament
put in place and it takes six months

234
00:13:03,341 --> 00:13:05,740
before you totally heal up.
But the pain is nothing.

235
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:08,740
It's like it's not that big a deal.
The pain of the meniscus tear.

236
00:13:08,741 --> 00:13:11,710
I had what's called a bucket handle
tear and it's called the bucket handle.

237
00:13:11,711 --> 00:13:16,330
Cause you know how a bucket handle can
like flip up and it can like stop like in

238
00:13:16,331 --> 00:13:18,430
the center and the center position.
Well, that's what it's like.

239
00:13:18,431 --> 00:13:19,660
It's like the handle of a bucket,

240
00:13:19,661 --> 00:13:22,810
like literally peels up
and gets locked in place.

241
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:27,960
So this sliver of meniscus is law and
it's tearing and it's just excruciating

242
00:13:28,001 --> 00:13:31,140
fucking like soft tissue pain.
It's really good.

243
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:35,870
I had, I don't know what this is called,
where that top bone in the bottom bone,

244
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:40,260
like I, I twisted my leg weird
and it hit each other like, oh,

245
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:41,240
the thing in the middle,

246
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:44,540
I guess the knee socket or snapped
out a place in the top and hit,

247
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:48,200
they hit bottom bone and then snapped
right back. It's still fucked up,

248
00:13:48,201 --> 00:13:49,660
but it's still,
yeah,

249
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:52,790
it's still feels like it's going
to happen again all the time.

250
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:55,040
Like I'm so paranoid
because when that happened,

251
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:57,950
I was filming a home video and when I,

252
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:03,110
in the video you can just hear
me scream like bloody Mary, Mary,

253
00:14:03,111 --> 00:14:05,520
and then a bloody Mary bloody murder.
And it,

254
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:09,830
I'm thinking of a different thing and then
post it. Yeah, you have that shit. It's,

255
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:13,580
it's one of those videos my dad
has on some VHS tapes somewhere.

256
00:14:13,581 --> 00:14:14,414
I'm gonna have to get

257
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:17,230
scour your dad's closets.
We need to have a video for this story.

258
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:22,000
So I never finished the video too.
So, um, you, did you break a ligament?

259
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:26,060
I think he said he said that, I mean
this was a long time ago, but he said it.

260
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:29,220
He told me what happened and then I had
to wear like this cast thing for a long

261
00:14:29,221 --> 00:14:33,820
time. Uh, maybe like six months or
something like that. Ever since then.

262
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:36,000
Six months, Huh? Yeah, it was a while.

263
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:40,900
Wow. Yeah. The body is
so God damn fragile.

264
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:41,980
I was in,
um,

265
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:46,060
we were in Pittsburgh and we were watching
dudes on motorcycles with no helmets.

266
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:49,210
They don't have a helmet law there. Just
watching them drive around like, God,

267
00:14:49,211 --> 00:14:52,400
you silly fuck.
Like your body's so fragile.

268
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,600
You don't even know you.

269
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:56,630
If you knew what could happen to
your head if you hit the ground,

270
00:14:56,631 --> 00:14:58,190
would you be willing to roll those dice,

271
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:02,000
which you really be willing to just get
on a bike with a bunch of people and

272
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:04,250
trust them not to slam into you.
Trust them.

273
00:15:04,251 --> 00:15:07,380
Not to smash your fucking
head off the concrete. Really.

274
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:08,300
You didn't just trust him.

275
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:13,370
The problem with motorcycles is that the
reason you get it is because you want

276
00:15:13,371 --> 00:15:16,200
chicks to see you on the motorcycle.
The helmet, they can't see you.

277
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:18,880
So that's why there's hardly guys
they like had found a loophole.

278
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:22,870
They just a little cap on the fucking
top. They want their face exposed. Man.

279
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,440
It always goes into that with you.

280
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:28,610
It always goes to his
dudes were in that Nsx.

281
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:31,340
We're driving around,
I'm a fucking pain.

282
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:34,820
Eddies driving and dropping it down
to fourth gear on the highway and she

283
00:15:34,821 --> 00:15:38,630
doesn't know what the fuck
he's doing. Right. While he's
looking around, he's like,

284
00:15:38,631 --> 00:15:41,150
damn, check show looking at me
man. Cause I'm looking at me.

285
00:15:41,151 --> 00:15:44,660
They never look at me in my fucking
Bronco are looking at me like that bitch

286
00:15:44,661 --> 00:15:47,690
right there. She's looking at me, man.
She's looking at me right now. Explore,

287
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:48,560
explore.
I'm sorry

288
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:53,020
dude. When we would drive, we would drive
your Barracuda, the big fish, a catfish,

289
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:57,610
catfish, sick fish. Old
Men wanted a soccer dad.

290
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:02,170
They were like pulling up going
whole, everybody that was, you know.

291
00:16:02,171 --> 00:16:06,790
Have you ever been in his car driving
around? Everybody says Holy Shit,

292
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:11,080
like 15 year old dudes that are rappers
and shit look over and trip out.

293
00:16:11,081 --> 00:16:15,430
You know it's, it's too ridiculous. It's
too, it sounds like a tyrannosaurus rex.

294
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:18,940
Someone like machine when you rather,
how does it sound?

295
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:23,020
I forget slot a lot.
I used to have that.

296
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:26,590
My friend just did a photo shoot with
that kit from the original knight rider

297
00:16:26,591 --> 00:16:29,270
car from the 80s though. A
photo shoot with a kit. Yeah.

298
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,490
And now it's like thinking wow,

299
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:33,800
some guy owns kit and he rents
it out like some that, yeah,

300
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:36,640
I think it's an Asian businessman and
he rents it out and I'm thinking, wow,

301
00:16:36,641 --> 00:16:40,660
they actually let kit mixed with porn.
That's weird to me.

302
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:44,200
I guess I can have control.
Yeah. Isn't that weird though?

303
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:49,570
I think after 25 years it's like
public domain or so I wonder if it is,

304
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,760
some things are right on some movies,

305
00:16:51,761 --> 00:16:55,720
public domain and like books are public
domain. Yeah. A certain amount of time.

306
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:59,840
Yeah. How many, how many years
is it comfort with theater?

307
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,190
I think you could do anything
you want with those lines.

308
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:06,310
You can start your own TV station.
I'm just putting nothing because

309
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:12,220
it cost,
it costs more to just get the,

310
00:17:12,221 --> 00:17:16,210
keep the license going then if they're
worth really so no one owns them.

311
00:17:16,211 --> 00:17:19,420
Literally you can't nobody.
Yeah, nobody owns it.

312
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:23,830
Nobody owns in the public domain.
How many movies you think, dude,

313
00:17:23,831 --> 00:17:28,030
I'm not an expert in this panel.
There's nobody in the public.

314
00:17:28,031 --> 00:17:29,200
Once I plug public domain,

315
00:17:29,201 --> 00:17:32,560
you've got to get the shit
registered every 25 years or so.

316
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:36,070
And if there's no one there to register
and most of those guys are in China and

317
00:17:36,071 --> 00:17:40,770
they're dead from the triads
and nobody's allowed to

318
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,840
the mine from my old taekwondo days,
my friend Larry Jones,

319
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:49,870
Larry Jones was a phene for Chinese Kung
Fu movies and he would always go and

320
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:52,530
he would like come to the
gym the next day. Oh Man,

321
00:17:52,531 --> 00:17:57,000
I saw this bad ass Shaolin
is Shaolin seven months.

322
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:01,590
He would like every week it will be some
new fucking Kung Fu movie that he just

323
00:18:01,591 --> 00:18:04,860
saw and loved and he would get together
with a bunch of his friends from the gym

324
00:18:04,861 --> 00:18:06,120
and they would all go
watch he's come from,

325
00:18:06,121 --> 00:18:09,090
would they get excited and while she's
there was like real fighters and they're

326
00:18:09,091 --> 00:18:12,180
going to watch these shitty Kung
Fu movies and I try to watch them.

327
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:15,470
I never got it. I tried, man. I sat
down and then I tried to watch them.

328
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:16,081
That's the problem.

329
00:18:16,081 --> 00:18:19,710
Anybody who got Bruce Lee first
is not into comfort with theater.

330
00:18:19,711 --> 00:18:22,170
I don't think so. How could you
tried? You know what I mean? I think,

331
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:25,330
I dunno what it is really.
That's just my guess.

332
00:18:25,331 --> 00:18:28,890
But after on Bruce Lee or like fuck
these guys are, everyone's trying to,

333
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:33,530
I mean there was Bruce lies about
that. He's more than one, right?

334
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:37,560
How many downsides were there? How famous
was he? Was he famous like in China?

335
00:18:37,561 --> 00:18:40,050
Was he going to them popping bottles?
You know what I mean?

336
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:43,420
For a couple of years we've probably
got laid. He was like Dan Cortez.

337
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,830
That's how dumb these
people think the people are,

338
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:52,710
that they could just put a fake Bruce
Lee up and a good percentage of them

339
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,960
automatically get to know the difference.
Is it because they,

340
00:18:54,961 --> 00:18:56,520
he was almost playing a character,

341
00:18:56,521 --> 00:19:00,240
would you think like maybe like he was
almost like a James Bond put out game of

342
00:19:00,241 --> 00:19:03,560
death. They only had 10 minutes
of that movie with Bruce Lee tree.

343
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:07,740
The whole movie is not Bruce Lee.
It's a game of death.

344
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:08,791
The beginning is,

345
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:12,570
but the beginning of game of death
is the end of return of the Dragon.

346
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:15,510
They start with the Chuck Norris fight,
so it looks like a Bruce Lee movie,

347
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:20,100
but that's another movie.
So they replayed that scene again,

348
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:23,570
the exams in the beginning, that's how
the movie started. Game of debt starts.

349
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:27,380
The only thing that's Bruce Lee is the
end where he goes up and fights, fights.

350
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:30,270
Kareem Abdul Jabbar, that's
all him, but everything,

351
00:19:30,271 --> 00:19:33,170
the whole movie is an
imposter. I need to see. Wow.

352
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:38,210
I need to see that again to every
year and there's a beginning.

353
00:19:38,491 --> 00:19:41,700
There's a scene where the big
Muesli sitting in his dressing room,

354
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:42,810
because this is how they started,

355
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:46,770
they start the movie with the fight with
Chuck Norris and return of the Dragon.

356
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:52,190
And then the movie is about a famous
soup martial arts superstar loosely based

357
00:19:52,321 --> 00:19:57,300
on Bruce Lee. So once all the credits are
over and the fights over, they go cut.

358
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,240
And then Bruce,
I think Bruce Lee walks offset.

359
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,190
Like all of a sudden
that was just a movie,

360
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,410
that fight scene and it's about a
famous actor and the Chinese tried,

361
00:20:06,411 --> 00:20:09,840
they're trying to control them or
whatever. So from that point on,

362
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:12,450
it's a fake Bruce Lee. The whole time
he's sitting in his dressing room,

363
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:16,470
he's talking to this guy, this
mafia guy, and they put a picture,

364
00:20:16,471 --> 00:20:20,670
a still picture like right where his
head's at. There's a still picture.

365
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,770
So it's a Bruce,
a picture of Bruce Lee.

366
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:25,680
You could see the guy's shoulders
are moving. It's a moving picture.

367
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:28,530
That's how bad it was.
And everyone wants to see this.

368
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:31,380
I don't want to believe I was seven years
old when that shit came out and get to

369
00:20:31,381 --> 00:20:34,620
know the difference. I didn't know
the difference. They fooled me.

370
00:20:34,621 --> 00:20:37,560
They pulled the kids maybe back then.

371
00:20:37,561 --> 00:20:41,010
That special effect actually
for the adults too and the
whole movie he's got big

372
00:20:41,011 --> 00:20:42,870
shades on and they never get any closer.

373
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:45,010
It's always from the side
and he's got big shit.

374
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:48,020
I wonder how much that one would be cost.

375
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:50,260
How much does that cost to make?

376
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:53,320
And they probably made a fuck
load of money with it too. Right?

377
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:57,310
Cause people probably saw your movie.
They didn't have fucking Yelp back then.

378
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,320
They didn't have fan Dora.
You know what I mean?

379
00:20:59,321 --> 00:21:03,460
You can't look find out how bad a movie
was by just going online. Like now.

380
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:06,640
Well now you find out real quick.
If a movie's a piece of shit,

381
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:10,090
it's like it could be out a couple hours
and people were already freaking out

382
00:21:10,091 --> 00:21:13,900
about it. Yeah, it may even
before, because people get
screeners, they get, they get,

383
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:16,600
they get previews before
people go to previews.

384
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:19,420
You can't sneak a shitty
movie through anymore.

385
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:23,110
The bank and that the amp committed
took weeks before everybody figured out.

386
00:21:23,111 --> 00:21:26,750
That movie sucked. Yeah, I came
up with that. Yeah, the kids,

387
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:29,800
I thought it was great because the
end is a class. It's still Bruce Lee.

388
00:21:29,801 --> 00:21:34,420
They ended strong. He fights down in a
Kareem Abdul Jabbar, some taekwondo guy.

389
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:37,700
All that Shit's beautiful. Yeah,
that was pretty bad ass and that's,

390
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:41,470
that's really the only seen people like,
remember when they watched as a kid,

391
00:21:41,471 --> 00:21:44,230
you remember, remember game of death.
He's finding Kareem Abdul Jabbar.

392
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:47,710
That's really all you remember. You don't
remember all the bullshit fake shit,

393
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:52,120
but when me and my friends are talking
about the best Bruce Lee move move ever

394
00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:56,470
to Wa, the the Best Bruce Lee movie ever
was actually done by the fake Bruce Lee.

395
00:21:57,430 --> 00:22:00,190
If guy was holding him,
a guy who was holding him like this,

396
00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:05,370
he came from [inaudible] and held them
and the fake Bruce Lee did a backflip,

397
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:10,060
kicked him and landed back on its feet.
It was a fake Bruce Lee.

398
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:12,450
The vape was there from
game of Dad. He, the guy

399
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:17,020
did a backflip, kicked him,
and then landed on his feet.

400
00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:19,690
I wonder if that one dude is
that he still goes around.

401
00:22:19,691 --> 00:22:24,210
You remember that scene came of, he looks
like Bruce Lee. It's not loosely ads.

402
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:28,600
Meek. We need a documentary on
the fake Bruce Lee. All of us.

403
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:31,030
Well we need a documentary
on the guy who did that flip.

404
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:35,620
But that was cuts in it. So it wasn't
like one thing, you know, it was,

405
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:39,700
there was some cuts and so it wasn't
just some wild kamikaze type shit,

406
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,280
but that wasn't the top three
of best Bruce Lee moves ever.

407
00:22:42,281 --> 00:22:44,230
And it wasn't even him.
When I met Chuck Norris,

408
00:22:44,231 --> 00:22:49,000
who was one of the few times in my
life where I was genuinely freaked out,

409
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:51,320
like, like I'm shaking his hand,
I'm going to meet him and him to,

410
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:54,400
and he knows who I am. He's talking
to me and I'm like, Holy Shit,

411
00:22:54,401 --> 00:22:57,700
this is Chuck Norris.
Like this is really Chuck Norris.

412
00:22:57,940 --> 00:23:00,830
And the third thing I thought about
was that movie with him and Bruce Lee.

413
00:23:00,831 --> 00:23:03,820
And I'm like, this motherfucker
fought Bruce Lee in a movie.

414
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:07,240
You know what I'm saying?
I mean that is a crazy scene too.

415
00:23:07,241 --> 00:23:12,160
He's like the bad ass karate guy and
then loosely and him go at it. Holy Shit.

416
00:23:12,161 --> 00:23:16,000
That was a good scene. It be hard
to top Bruce Lee. Just the base.

417
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:20,800
I used to like Chuck Norris because Chuck
Norris was down with Bruce Lee because

418
00:23:20,801 --> 00:23:25,300
by association, even though Chuck
Norris wasn't as dynamic as Bruce Lee,

419
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,730
he was still in a Bruce Lee movie,
you know,

420
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,730
and there was some cool shit
about him because he was American.

421
00:23:29,731 --> 00:23:33,580
He wore cowboy boots and fucking cowboy
hat and he jacked guys up sort of like a

422
00:23:33,581 --> 00:23:37,220
karate but American style, you
know. I thought he was a high,

423
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:42,220
low most McQuaid him. David Carradine.
Come on son. You Remember Billy Jack?

424
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:46,030
Yes. Cowboy with a roundhouse
kick is known for his roundhouse.

425
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,300
You remember he would tell the guy,

426
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:51,410
I'm going to put this foot upside your
head and there's not a thing you can do

427
00:23:51,411 --> 00:23:53,930
about it. I remember
thinking at the time, wow,

428
00:23:53,931 --> 00:23:57,500
that is fucking a white guy talking shit.
Nobody wasn't really white.

429
00:23:57,501 --> 00:24:00,490
He was an American Indian.
Nobody under 30 remember until the job

430
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:04,970
Billy Jack, like there was
always these hippie bitches.

431
00:24:04,971 --> 00:24:08,720
They were like around him bothering
him all the time. You know,

432
00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:11,870
he would like take care of the hippies
and he was like half Indian or something,

433
00:24:11,871 --> 00:24:13,760
wasn't he?
I don't fucking know.

434
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:17,810
That'd be cool if Chuck
Norris flew around in Airwolf.

435
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:20,360
You don't like that was his
modes of transportation.

436
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:23,560
If you flew around with a giant helicopter
from the eighties you remember those

437
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,220
when,
how did we ever talk about this?

438
00:24:25,221 --> 00:24:28,730
It seems like we did where helicopters
were really popular in the 80s and it was

439
00:24:28,731 --> 00:24:33,320
like blue thunder Airwolf and there was
all these sitcoms about helicopters,

440
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:37,900
drama shows, drama shows. Yeah.
What the fuck was that helicopter?

441
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:41,210
It's like, you know, it's like sort
of, we were talking about Knight Rider,

442
00:24:41,211 --> 00:24:43,880
I'll fucking, you know a
show about a car. Right.

443
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:47,090
But at least that car talk
back then was just like, no,

444
00:24:47,091 --> 00:24:48,650
that's just a bad ass helicopter.

445
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:54,170
Remember was Roy Stridor Scheider
yes. In blue thunder, blue thunder.

446
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:59,420
Stupid movie about a giant helicopter
went crazy. What the fuck, man?

447
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:03,320
It's amazing when you go
back just a couple of decades
and look at the shit that

448
00:25:03,321 --> 00:25:07,240
people are willing to tolerate.
People were so stupid. Yeah, I know.

449
00:25:07,241 --> 00:25:11,570
If you want evolution, man, you need look
no further than human television. Look,

450
00:25:11,571 --> 00:25:15,170
look, look at TV shows for like the
50s. Go try to watch like Andy Rooney.

451
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:19,470
I was watching a clip online. It was from
the Andy Griffith show and it was um,

452
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:24,580
it was a Jack Nicholson. Jack
Nicholson was playing a bad guy and um,

453
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:27,260
Ron Howard was in it and
when he was a little boy,

454
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:32,290
when he was opie who he was before he
was opening preop pre AOP. Wow. What was,

455
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:35,750
who was he? He was opening on happy days
before. What was he on the other show?

456
00:25:36,530 --> 00:25:41,120
The Andy Griffith show. He was the
little Brat Kid. There's a little boy,

457
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:43,940
he's a little boy and Jack
Nicholson is there and it's like,

458
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:47,540
it was fucking phones
on and it's so stupid.

459
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:51,530
It's just so obviously dumb, you know?
It's like if you had it on today,

460
00:25:51,531 --> 00:25:54,650
you would just start throwing
shit at the TV. Go, what the fuck?

461
00:25:54,651 --> 00:25:58,970
Kind of acting is what the fuck kind of
shows us who wrote this stupid thing.

462
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:02,570
But back then that shit flew.
That was, that was entertainment.

463
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:06,710
I can't watch fucking anything in black
and white except for twilight zone.

464
00:26:06,711 --> 00:26:09,290
I can still watch that cause it
didn't happen. They never had,

465
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:11,540
they sometimes had happy endings,

466
00:26:11,541 --> 00:26:15,470
but you never knew if it was going to be
a bad ending. Sad ending, happy ending.

467
00:26:15,471 --> 00:26:17,660
I love that.
But one show,

468
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:22,610
one 99.9 of everything back
then. To me, my opinion suck.

469
00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:25,790
You're right. I Love Lucy. Every
now and then you watch that.

470
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:27,770
There was some clever
writing and I love Lucy.

471
00:26:27,771 --> 00:26:30,860
I mean that thing stood the test of time.
It's still showing it now.

472
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:33,470
It's still on now. You're
right. Most things suck.

473
00:26:33,471 --> 00:26:37,430
But there's a few that fucking that
really stand out still like the hustler.

474
00:26:37,490 --> 00:26:40,620
You ever watched the hustler with Jackie
Gleason and Paul Newman? The movie? Yeah.

475
00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:44,130
With who the fuck played Burt,
the guy from

476
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:45,090
Shit I forget,

477
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:50,160
but a very famous actor as well and
it's fucking incredible. Piper, Laurie,

478
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:52,860
you know the, that woman, she
played a a check in the movie.

479
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:54,090
It's a fucking great story.

480
00:26:54,091 --> 00:26:58,890
It's like it's a good well acted movie
and it's from like 1963 like there's a

481
00:26:58,891 --> 00:27:01,710
few who's afraid of Virginia Woolf?
That's Elizabeth Taylor.

482
00:27:01,711 --> 00:27:06,600
Back when she was hot as fuck.
Elizabeth tail was hot as fuck back then.

483
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:10,620
And who's afraid of Virginia Woolf is
a bad ass fucking movie that completely

484
00:27:10,621 --> 00:27:13,260
holds the test of time. If you watch
the movie today, be like, Whoa,

485
00:27:13,261 --> 00:27:14,370
that was a good guy that I'm moving.

486
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:16,440
And it was like from 1960
or something like that.

487
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:19,110
There's a few movies from back
then when they really nailed it.

488
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:20,040
They really got it right.

489
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:23,140
Do you remember that movie? I
Africa, the name of it? It had,

490
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:25,990
I think Joe Piscopo during his big,

491
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:29,920
when he was kind of famous in the early
eighties and it used to have like this

492
00:27:29,921 --> 00:27:33,400
little documentary in the middle of Johnny
dangerously. Is that the name of it?

493
00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:37,960
Yeah. And John, John and
dangerously was, um, what the
fuck is his name? Joe Piscapo.

494
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:41,350
Yeah, Joe Piscopo. And what was the
other guy? The good, the guy was Batman.

495
00:27:41,351 --> 00:27:45,360
The first Batman. Michael Key. Michael
Key. Everybody remember the cartoon?

496
00:27:45,361 --> 00:27:46,300
I as a kid,

497
00:27:46,301 --> 00:27:49,930
I remember thinking how cool this was
that your penis in you and it was like

498
00:27:49,931 --> 00:27:54,480
this animated cartoon of this penis
and two balls walking around and stuff.

499
00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:55,563
I don't remember that.

500
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,510
Check out this penis sometime.
It's pretty George.

501
00:27:58,511 --> 00:28:02,050
See Scott was the other guy who was in
the hustler, so fucking great movie.

502
00:28:02,051 --> 00:28:03,950
And that's 1961 man.

503
00:28:03,970 --> 00:28:08,140
It's not even 63 61 they were a,
it's back then.

504
00:28:09,010 --> 00:28:12,970
Damn. They were stupid. Really Mad.
I mean it's, it's a good movie,

505
00:28:12,971 --> 00:28:14,470
but even though it's a good movie,

506
00:28:14,471 --> 00:28:18,130
you could still tell me how goofy
people were back then. Richard Nixon,

507
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:20,920
you watch him talk of your bullshit.

508
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:25,030
Radar doesn't go off when you're watching
Richard Nixon. Just any kind of speech.

509
00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:30,160
It like, it's like George W.
Bush. Yeah, that's what I was
going to say. If you, yeah,

510
00:28:30,161 --> 00:28:33,690
if you can't say that because of Bush,
the real problem with,

511
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:37,240
with dump Alta or right lying politicians
is there's a lot of fucking dumb

512
00:28:37,241 --> 00:28:41,350
people out there, man. Yeah. And George W.

513
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:44,830
Bush is the master for sure. He's
the master of the dump, the dummies.

514
00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:49,130
But Richard Nixon was pretty
bad too. Everyone else's,
not that bad. Bill Clinton,

515
00:28:49,131 --> 00:28:53,790
Smooth Obama, smooth as hell. Even Ronald
Reagan was smooth this out. You know,

516
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:56,470
Richard Carter, he sounds like
he's a smart guy. Richard Carter,

517
00:28:56,471 --> 00:28:59,740
James Richard Carter,
you know that fucking guy,

518
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:04,250
opie Richard Nixon. He's just, he sounded
like a smart guy, but he was always,

519
00:29:04,251 --> 00:29:07,990
he sounded paranoid and insincere in
everything he said. Richard Nixon,

520
00:29:07,991 --> 00:29:12,520
Richard Nixon, he was a, he was a piece
of shit. He was a terrible person. He was,

521
00:29:12,670 --> 00:29:15,730
he was one of those guys that got away
with shit back in a time where you could

522
00:29:15,731 --> 00:29:18,850
get away with anything. You know, the
days before they killed Kennedy, you know,

523
00:29:18,851 --> 00:29:23,010
till you know, till Nixon's era and you
know, you'd go deep. The Reagan did.

524
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:25,510
P three p were getting away with all
kinds of crazy shit that you can never get

525
00:29:25,511 --> 00:29:27,040
away with now.
You know,

526
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:30,970
and they got away with a lot of the
dirty fucking politics back then to what

527
00:29:30,971 --> 00:29:32,770
Nixon did was totally standard stuff.

528
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:36,280
What he got impeached for it water
game was something they all did, man.

529
00:29:36,281 --> 00:29:39,730
We've been doing that to the Russians
forever. You know, I have a buddy,

530
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,130
I guess we shouldn't say his,
who used

531
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:47,130
to work for the u s embassy in
Russia and he would find all these,

532
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:48,760
uh,
it was like standard.

533
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:53,110
They would find all these audio detection
devices all over the place or audio

534
00:29:53,111 --> 00:29:55,720
recording devices and the Russians
were listening in to them.

535
00:29:55,930 --> 00:29:58,280
They found these Russians,
uh,

536
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:03,540
things that they made were so complicated
that they operated on the swaying of

537
00:30:03,701 --> 00:30:06,400
the building,
that that's what powered them.

538
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:11,360
The swaying of the building back and
forth actually charged them up and power

539
00:30:11,361 --> 00:30:15,400
them. So they had no external
source of power. These are like,

540
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:19,390
this was so complicated. He's like, when
when they found that stuff, he's like,

541
00:30:19,391 --> 00:30:22,660
we didn't even know this shit existed.
So that's been standard.

542
00:30:22,661 --> 00:30:25,540
People have been spying on
people and listening into people.

543
00:30:25,541 --> 00:30:29,560
That's just what they do. Every fucking
politician, every president did it.

544
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:31,390
You don't think Kennedy did it?
You know,

545
00:30:31,391 --> 00:30:34,300
everybody likes to look at Kennedy
like he's says rosy, you know,

546
00:30:34,301 --> 00:30:37,870
beautiful figure from our liberal
back, you know, or liberal pass.

547
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:40,840
But Kennedy's family was all
fucking moonshine runners.

548
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:44,470
They made all their money selling
illegal booze and there was all sorts of

549
00:30:44,471 --> 00:30:48,130
people that were just like the tea party.
People are today trying to get rid of.

550
00:30:48,131 --> 00:30:51,070
Obama gone crazy about the
democratically elected president,

551
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:53,950
Democrat president rather. They were
doing the same thing for Kennedy.

552
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:57,370
They were wanted for trees and they'd
make posters with Kennedy's face on it.

553
00:30:57,490 --> 00:30:59,950
Nobody likes to think about that
shit because it happened so long ago.

554
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:01,420
What about the fact that he was,

555
00:31:01,421 --> 00:31:04,600
out of all the presidents
that have ever existed,

556
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:08,620
he's the one who had the worst reputation
as far as womanizing. Oh yeah, dude.

557
00:31:08,621 --> 00:31:10,420
If they found out what he was doing today,

558
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:14,770
he was probably just straight Clinton
and bitches. You know more than Clinton.

559
00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:18,120
You think he was? I don't, I
don't, I shouldn't say Clinton.

560
00:31:18,121 --> 00:31:21,730
And because when Clinton Clinton move
is Clinton moves, you get a girl alone,

561
00:31:21,731 --> 00:31:23,160
you just whip your cock out,
you know,

562
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:26,470
and then they scream and fucking run
away from you and freak out and you go to

563
00:31:26,471 --> 00:31:27,880
jail.
That's a Clinton move.

564
00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:31,280
He's the only president that
probably rocked it that way. Yeah,

565
00:31:31,450 --> 00:31:33,730
it probably is it probably
Obama and in that shit,

566
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:36,230
you know it's actually shit up. Obama
was probably not what they should do.

567
00:31:36,231 --> 00:31:39,070
A president should be smart if they're
going to fuck around with these,

568
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:42,040
these interns offered them
and their family a thought.

569
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:43,990
The underground cities
when shit goes down,

570
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:47,740
they ain't going to say she was a firm
believer in the underground cities

571
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:50,620
they're building out. It's not like
that much of a secret. Oh yeah.

572
00:31:50,621 --> 00:31:54,070
I mean I've seen, I've seen underground
bunkers and bases and shit like that.

573
00:31:54,071 --> 00:31:56,770
But you're a friend, you're a believer
in that shit. Like you want to go there.

574
00:31:56,771 --> 00:32:00,850
If the shit goes down. I'm trying to,
I'm trying to teach Jujitsu to CIA.

575
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:07,080
Give me a couple of VIP passes the moment,
the moment,

576
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:08,023
the first,
uh,

577
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:12,350
the first atomic bomb blows
or the first asteroid hits.

578
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:14,330
I want to be under that thing.

579
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:17,330
I want to be at the epicenter
wherever that bomb goes off.

580
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,830
I want to be at the part where

581
00:32:18,990 --> 00:32:22,100
all they find a view as a shadow.
That's what I want to be.

582
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:26,730
I want to be right there.
Fuck that down with some Mad Max shit.

583
00:32:26,731 --> 00:32:30,510
I don't want to be sick not
having hospitals to go to

584
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:35,970
the song. Yeah, I agree with you
though. You know what a mom drops

585
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:40,400
and we're feeling the fallout here,
but still alive. What do you do?

586
00:32:40,401 --> 00:32:42,920
Like blow your head up.
No, no. Look, I'm going to,

587
00:32:42,921 --> 00:32:45,410
I'm going to follow my human
instincts and keep on keeping on.

588
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:49,520
But if I had to choose between living a
life of fucking cancer and radiation and

589
00:32:49,521 --> 00:32:53,750
zombies or getting hit in the head where
media I'll take getting hit in the head

590
00:32:53,751 --> 00:32:56,840
by a media.
What's your take on the Zombie situation?

591
00:32:56,870 --> 00:33:00,560
It's funny how many fucking
shows and movies and things.

592
00:33:00,561 --> 00:33:01,760
People that believe they're real.

593
00:33:01,761 --> 00:33:05,540
There's video shows where they're talking
about preparing against zombies. Yeah,

594
00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:09,650
I mean, the book, the reason
why is because we know
about so many parasitic, uh,

595
00:33:09,651 --> 00:33:10,570
animals in,
in the,

596
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:14,630
in the animal kingdom that changed the
host and turn the host into something

597
00:33:14,631 --> 00:33:18,140
that it's not. We know of. There's a
aquatic worms we've talked about before.

598
00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:22,360
Take a drink. If you're playing the
podcasts, we've talked about it before.

599
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:25,760
Will wreak programs, a grasshopper's
brain, this aquatic warm,

600
00:33:25,761 --> 00:33:28,100
it infest the grasshopper
reprograms its brain,

601
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:30,500
and then convinces the
grasshopper to drown,

602
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:34,220
to convince is it to jump into water
and drown so that it can be born and it

603
00:33:34,221 --> 00:33:37,760
busts out of this things body cavity
and it makes it commit suicide.

604
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:41,720
So we know that there's
all sorts of parasites that
changed the host and get the

605
00:33:41,721 --> 00:33:45,260
host to do their bidding. And we also
know about rabies. We know that, you know,

606
00:33:45,261 --> 00:33:47,960
dogs get rabies. That's a wrap
son. They're dead. That's it.

607
00:33:47,961 --> 00:33:49,880
You've got to kill that dog.
They don't even cure him.

608
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:52,670
You can't cure a dog from rabies,
so you've got to kill that fucking thing.

609
00:33:52,850 --> 00:33:55,550
And if you get rabies, you
could die too. So rabies,

610
00:33:55,551 --> 00:33:59,060
we'll turn a dog into a vicious
fucking animal, like your own pet.

611
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:02,210
I had a dog that had distemper
once and it tried to bite me mad.

612
00:34:02,211 --> 00:34:05,720
A Doberman Pinscher dove and picture
snapping at me. I was like 12 years old.

613
00:34:05,721 --> 00:34:09,200
I was stuck in my living room with this
dog that was sick and I realized like

614
00:34:09,201 --> 00:34:11,840
halfway through, like looking at his dog
science, there's something wrong here.

615
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:14,780
I'm like, this thing is really
going to get me. This is my dog.

616
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:18,740
My Dog's going to kill me. I really,
really thought it was going to kill me.

617
00:34:18,741 --> 00:34:21,710
We had to get the dog put down. It
was scary shit. People that are dead,

618
00:34:21,950 --> 00:34:25,760
they're buried and then they were all
out of the dirt. Those people retarded.

619
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:29,720
That's not going to happen. But what
could happen is, you know, look,

620
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:32,360
there's all these people that are getting
their heads chopped off in the frozen.

621
00:34:32,390 --> 00:34:35,900
You know about all that cryogenics
I've heard about it. Well,

622
00:34:35,930 --> 00:34:38,870
there's people that are getting
their whole bodies frozen as well.

623
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:40,340
Like Walt Disney did.

624
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:43,910
Apparently they freeze your whole body
and so the one day they can bring you

625
00:34:43,911 --> 00:34:46,670
back, regenerate your body
tissue. I believe that.

626
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:50,660
Well that might be one zombies happened
because maybe your soul's long gone and

627
00:34:50,661 --> 00:34:51,770
all of a sudden you just got this,

628
00:34:51,950 --> 00:34:55,760
this tissue with no consciousness that
needs food all the time and eats anything

629
00:34:55,761 --> 00:34:56,430
in front of it.

630
00:34:56,430 --> 00:35:00,120
And we'll just grab a person and just
start eating you if you don't feed what?

631
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,560
I don't want to be cremated.
That's the exact reason I wanna.

632
00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:06,680
I wanna come back Zombie
and want to do that.

633
00:35:07,830 --> 00:35:10,730
You're going to kill people. It
could be a cool zombies, zombies,

634
00:35:10,731 --> 00:35:13,210
all the hangout flesh bro.
Do you not learn,

635
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:15,200
listen to the movie or
what about pay attention?

636
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:18,320
What about the soul comes back?

637
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:22,240
I gotta go back while does it going to
be alive and a couple of seconds I've got

638
00:35:22,241 --> 00:35:23,390
to go back.
Maybe.

639
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:26,240
Maybe there would be the first generation
of people that came back with a memory

640
00:35:26,241 --> 00:35:30,740
of the afterlife when Kennedy died
in south London. And that. Yeah.

641
00:35:30,970 --> 00:35:35,290
I remember when he was playing video games
and having to kill the Mormons. Yeah,

642
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:38,280
but Kenny died like a hundred
times mean that's ridiculous.

643
00:35:38,330 --> 00:35:41,970
But within the episode he came back
to the lap. That's never happened. Oh,

644
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:44,430
oh really? Yeah. Hmm. Yeah.

645
00:35:44,431 --> 00:35:47,250
Every week you just came back and no
one said a word about it. Robot chicken.

646
00:35:47,251 --> 00:35:50,310
They had an episode or Walt Disney comes
back to life and he became like this

647
00:35:50,311 --> 00:35:53,280
monster that just ate Puerto Rican babies.
It was pretty funny.

648
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:58,050
The real possibility is the possibility
that was expressed in that 28 days later

649
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:02,280
that someone comes out with some fucking
genetically altered super virus that

650
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:07,410
attacks the human body and literally
turns you into some fucking freaky,

651
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:11,090
crazy monster animal thing. Like
those 28 days, hard to kiss.

652
00:36:11,730 --> 00:36:15,660
Those fucking movies were awesome, man.
Especially twen 28 weeks later was okay.

653
00:36:15,810 --> 00:36:17,850
It was high. It was pretty
good. It's pretty good,

654
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,090
but it was following one of the greatest
harm movies of all time. You know?

655
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,160
There was no way he can
fucking really top that,

656
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:25,740
that that thought is very
terrifying to people.

657
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:29,580
The thought that one day you wake up
and the whole world's fucked and there's

658
00:36:29,581 --> 00:36:31,660
people out there in long
your sleep and they're,

659
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:34,980
they're coming in and they have axes
and shit and they want to eat. You know,

660
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:38,820
I mean, that's, it's a terrible fucking
thought. That dot that, you know,

661
00:36:38,821 --> 00:36:40,500
people eating human flesh,
you know,

662
00:36:40,501 --> 00:36:44,340
there's been documented very recently
that they think that it was a,

663
00:36:44,341 --> 00:36:48,420
it was done like ritualistically for
thousands and thousands of years.

664
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:51,930
And then people have been eating people
like whether they killed them in battle

665
00:36:51,931 --> 00:36:53,700
or that small children,

666
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:58,200
they found a small children with tool
marks on their bodies that they're

667
00:36:58,230 --> 00:37:02,100
positive and inside their brains in the
brain cavity that they're positive with

668
00:37:02,101 --> 00:37:06,150
someone's scooping and scraping out their
brains and cutting off their meeting,

669
00:37:06,151 --> 00:37:08,490
eating it. So people have been, yeah,

670
00:37:08,491 --> 00:37:12,120
people have been preying on other
people for forever. That's look man,

671
00:37:12,121 --> 00:37:13,740
when people are starving to death,

672
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:17,010
you know if you're living like thousands
and thousands of years before written

673
00:37:17,011 --> 00:37:20,940
language and people are starving to
death and you're a bunch of fucking skin

674
00:37:20,941 --> 00:37:24,150
wearing savages and you look over the
hill and there's a bunch of other skin

675
00:37:24,151 --> 00:37:24,730
wearing savage,

676
00:37:24,730 --> 00:37:28,440
do you look back at your babies are
screaming in agony because there's no food

677
00:37:28,441 --> 00:37:29,610
in their body and you say,

678
00:37:29,611 --> 00:37:31,890
I'm just going to go kill these
motherfuckers and eat them,

679
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:34,920
and people did that shit.
I bet they did that shit all the time.

680
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:38,700
They probably ate their own babies too.
They did eat there. I'm sure they did.

681
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:43,410
Animals do it all the time if animals do
it for sure somewhere a human before it

682
00:37:43,411 --> 00:37:47,190
became the human being of
circuit 2011 for sure. Someone,

683
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:50,220
someone did everything that an animal's
done. Animals always eat babies.

684
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:55,050
I had hamsters man, and they got a wet
tale. I think it was what it's called.

685
00:37:55,051 --> 00:37:55,884
It's a disease.

686
00:37:55,900 --> 00:38:00,900
I was a little kid and all of a sudden
our sweet mama hamster started eating her

687
00:38:00,961 --> 00:38:04,860
fucking babies, man, and
eating them brains first.

688
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:07,770
Like just attacking the brain. My
mom was like, get out of the room.

689
00:38:07,771 --> 00:38:09,110
I don't want you to seeing
this. Get out of here. Oh.

690
00:38:09,111 --> 00:38:13,610
And I had a car can see and his fucking
hamsters just holding onto our babies

691
00:38:13,611 --> 00:38:18,110
and just brain in. Are you kidding?
Oh Dude. It was fucking deep,

692
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:22,110
man. You know, that was a
real thing, dude. It was
deep. It was so hard to watch.

693
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:24,090
I was like,
I couldn't believe what I was seeing.

694
00:38:24,091 --> 00:38:27,990
This mama hamster that I always loved.
You know, we had the momma and the,

695
00:38:28,050 --> 00:38:28,411
you know,

696
00:38:28,411 --> 00:38:31,600
and the baby boy and they got together
and they made babies in the baby.

697
00:38:31,601 --> 00:38:34,620
Somehow or another got this fucking
disease and the mother just killed him in

698
00:38:34,621 --> 00:38:38,110
front of us. Killed them in
eight dumb bro. It was, fuck.

699
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:42,100
I never looked at that pitch the same
way again. She was no longer my friend.

700
00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:46,750
You are, you're, you're rocking it to
a different set of rules, you know?

701
00:38:46,751 --> 00:38:49,450
I can't really,
I can't just pick you up at pet.

702
00:38:49,451 --> 00:38:52,030
You now I want to bash your
brains on the sidewalk.

703
00:38:52,031 --> 00:38:56,350
You fucking creep your baby and creep.
You know what the fuck man

704
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:58,980
did you ever have those balls where you
put the hamster in it and we're like go

705
00:38:58,981 --> 00:39:02,970
around the circle and stuff like that.
I rolled around and everything.

706
00:39:02,971 --> 00:39:07,020
I was so mad at my sister once and I
didn't know she had her hamster in a ball

707
00:39:07,290 --> 00:39:09,090
and so I'm like,
I'll take this.

708
00:39:09,091 --> 00:39:12,480
And I kicked it really hard thinking
I was just going to break the ball.

709
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:16,890
The hamster just flew right out
of it though. And uh, it was okay,

710
00:39:16,891 --> 00:39:20,400
but it was the most scariest thing ever.
It was so grift yeah,

711
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:21,241
but it was so gross.
It's,

712
00:39:21,241 --> 00:39:23,730
you know when you're a kid and he sees
something disgusting and you're just like,

713
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:23,980
I'm

714
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:26,610
not going to look at it.
[inaudible] hamsters.

715
00:39:26,910 --> 00:39:30,700
How Durable Hampshire's this motherfucker
is filming a video and he falls down

716
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:33,090
screaming like a little
bitch cause cause he's,

717
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:35,860
he twisted your knee in a
funny way and his hamster,

718
00:39:35,861 --> 00:39:39,970
you kick it across the room in a bar
doesn't even need to go to the doctor.

719
00:39:41,350 --> 00:39:46,330
Yeah. Hamsters. So speaking of people
and their affection for animals,

720
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:51,900
I was in Pittsburgh this last weekend
for the UFC and it was the same time as a

721
00:39:52,931 --> 00:39:54,370
furry convention.

722
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:58,180
I don't know if you're aware of this
because I certainly as fuck wasn't,

723
00:39:58,210 --> 00:40:02,290
I had heard of the term furry.
I'd heard it like very,

724
00:40:02,291 --> 00:40:06,310
very abstract. I never sat down and had
a conversation with anyone about it.

725
00:40:06,430 --> 00:40:10,220
It was just something that I've maybe
heard on the news or maybe saw, you know,

726
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:13,150
an article on the internet or something
that I never paid attention. I was like,

727
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:16,210
oh there's some people that have a thing
about wearing animal clothes and maybe

728
00:40:16,211 --> 00:40:21,211
they have sex with animals that I had
no idea of the depth of this hobby.

729
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:25,180
Or I go, well I don't know what
the fuck you would call it.

730
00:40:25,210 --> 00:40:28,480
You know the w this fascination,
this,

731
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:32,050
this thing that these people have
and this is what the fairy does.

732
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:37,060
What a furry is, is they want to look
like a cartoon animal like bugs bunny.

733
00:40:37,061 --> 00:40:37,711
I think the terms,

734
00:40:37,711 --> 00:40:42,430
the ampule anthropomorphic anthropomorphic
and what that means is you know human

735
00:40:42,431 --> 00:40:46,890
characteristics and an animal's body and
so they, they liked like Wiley Coyote.

736
00:40:46,891 --> 00:40:49,750
Like cause he stands up straight and
looks like a person you know like that's

737
00:40:49,751 --> 00:40:50,584
the shit they're into.

738
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:55,680
So they dress in these costumes that
make them look like animated cartoon.

739
00:40:56,831 --> 00:40:58,660
People that are animals,

740
00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:03,010
you know like dog costumes
and Fox costumes, costumes,

741
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:05,860
but they look like mascots or
things from like an amusement park.

742
00:41:05,890 --> 00:41:07,840
Mascots is the perfect
way to describe them.

743
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:11,830
They looked like mascots and I guess a
lot of them are wearing mascot outfits

744
00:41:11,831 --> 00:41:14,560
and that's where they get
these things from and they,

745
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:19,800
all they do the whole weekend is get
together and play like they're animals,

746
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:25,060
they don't talk, they have
their own language of like
grunts and certain things.

747
00:41:25,061 --> 00:41:29,140
That means certain noises like they've
created like a sub language and a fake

748
00:41:29,141 --> 00:41:34,010
language. And when they were staying at
the Westin hotel in Pittsburgh, they sold

749
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:36,200
out every fucking room in the hotel.
Okay,

750
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:38,840
so there's like 600 rooms in
Pittsburgh or the western,

751
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:43,960
they're all furries and they requested
a giant litter box in the front lobby

752
00:41:45,110 --> 00:41:49,640
that they requested that the west
and put in a fucking litter box.

753
00:41:49,790 --> 00:41:50,780
So this is what these people do.

754
00:41:50,781 --> 00:41:54,350
They go and get litter boxes and they
bring them up in the room and they take

755
00:41:54,351 --> 00:41:56,030
shits in their litter boxes.

756
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:59,780
They don't use the toilet and they don't
wash the light tubes. If you don't,

757
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:03,710
if you don't wash, you stink
like an animal. And that's
what we're trying to do.

758
00:42:03,711 --> 00:42:05,930
They're trying to smell that candle. It's
not all of them. I mean some of them,

759
00:42:06,170 --> 00:42:08,180
most of these varying,
no, no, no. There's women.

760
00:42:08,181 --> 00:42:13,070
And to varying degrees of depth to how
far you go into this thing, I don't know.

761
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:16,170
You can't see. They're wearing this
fucking crazy outfit whole time.

762
00:42:16,890 --> 00:42:20,270
We know what their bodies look like,
man, they don't talk. So you don't know.

763
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:22,430
You just know she's
wearing a girl's outfit.

764
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:25,970
So you assume it's a girl and they have
sex with their outfits on and they,

765
00:42:25,971 --> 00:42:28,640
they have, uh, the opening in
their crotch. They're like undo it.

766
00:42:28,641 --> 00:42:30,680
A velcro or zipper or
whatever the fuck they do.

767
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:34,370
Whip the shit out and just banging each
other right there with their outfits on.

768
00:42:34,371 --> 00:42:36,510
They fuck all the time.
They fuck crazy, huh?

769
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:39,040
My girlfriend's actually,
before I even heard about this,

770
00:42:39,041 --> 00:42:42,490
my girlfriend's been actually recently
trying to get me to go to our furry party

771
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:43,241
and she's like,
you know,

772
00:42:43,241 --> 00:42:47,410
we won't have to have sex with anybody
else and no one will know who you are and

773
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,071
we can just fuck.

774
00:42:48,071 --> 00:42:51,700
It's like an orgy by a bunch of furries
and wants you to bang her in front of a

775
00:42:51,701 --> 00:42:54,970
bunch of other freaks that aren't
showering and they're shitting and litter

776
00:42:54,971 --> 00:42:58,780
boxes and they're wearing, and she's
just for the experience. And I,

777
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:02,500
part of me almost would do it cause no
one would know who you are, you know,

778
00:43:02,501 --> 00:43:04,510
and stuff like that and
you'll see all these other,

779
00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:08,680
but I think just seeing a bunch of people
fucking in costumes like that would be

780
00:43:09,370 --> 00:43:12,640
worth it. And I know it's like so
bad. Some of them were diapers too.

781
00:43:12,641 --> 00:43:14,220
That's the other guy at the counter.

782
00:43:14,270 --> 00:43:18,290
The hotel was saying that it's
a real horror short, excuse me.

783
00:43:18,330 --> 00:43:19,960
Real horror show for the maids.

784
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:23,370
The port maid's go in there after
these freaks of left. Oh God.

785
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:26,230
There's litter boxes and
bowls of milk everywhere.

786
00:43:26,231 --> 00:43:30,670
The big the order bowls of milk from the
hotel and they have him bring it up and

787
00:43:30,671 --> 00:43:33,800
like in a giant bowl and they drink
it out of a bowl. Like a dog. Yeah,

788
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:38,190
I'd be a bunny. Yeah, you wouldn't be cat.

789
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:40,000
And he looks into my back yard,

790
00:43:40,350 --> 00:43:44,790
Jesus rabbit running around and he was
like, oh my God, look, it's a bunny.

791
00:43:45,350 --> 00:43:49,590
Got a bunny runs and chases it. And
you, you're like, oh, he's so sweet.

792
00:43:49,591 --> 00:43:54,360
Oh Bonnie's Bro. It's so funny. People
would think that. That's a joke. No,

793
00:43:54,361 --> 00:43:57,690
that's, that's for real man. Do you
think you could kill a bunny to eat it?

794
00:43:58,410 --> 00:44:02,130
Of course you could. Fuck
no darling. Maybe. Nah, man,

795
00:44:02,610 --> 00:44:05,460
I don't even like those people say
rabbit stew jokes and all that shit.

796
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:07,500
I don't think that's funny.
Really.

797
00:44:07,501 --> 00:44:10,440
You really have that much of
an affection for rabbits. Mad.

798
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:12,510
That's a little loving
creature, man. I mean,

799
00:44:12,511 --> 00:44:17,340
we have a relationship going on and man,
I love that fucking thing,

800
00:44:17,341 --> 00:44:21,540
man. I love rabbits. They look so
cute. They're so fucking beautiful.

801
00:44:21,541 --> 00:44:26,310
And they don't, they don't meow. They
don't bark. That'll make any noise.

802
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:31,200
And they love massages, man.
They load us. Don't love massage.

803
00:44:31,830 --> 00:44:32,000
She's

804
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,270
like, you know what? Cats, but cats
love massages and they're more, they,

805
00:44:35,271 --> 00:44:39,210
they ask for it. The more flamboyant
and the way they ask for. But you pip,

806
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:42,750
I pet a cat fur. I have two cats. I
pet them for 30 seconds to a minute.

807
00:44:42,870 --> 00:44:46,220
They're gone. They don't want to
massage no more. Not The bunny. I is,

808
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:48,580
he's willing to go all night.
I could pet them here

809
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:52,080
going, there's no way you, you
know my cat spass yeah, that guy.

810
00:44:52,090 --> 00:44:55,470
You could pet that cat for a hundred
days in a row. Oh really? Oh No. My cat.

811
00:44:55,620 --> 00:44:58,650
My cat. You better. I pet him for
30 seconds on how they're raised.

812
00:44:58,651 --> 00:45:00,570
If they're raised with
people all the time.

813
00:45:00,571 --> 00:45:02,760
Like my cat's been with
me since she was a kitten.

814
00:45:02,910 --> 00:45:04,840
So from the time she was a little,
it's all like,

815
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:08,040
you know what jumped me on me own
pets and everyday it's affection.

816
00:45:08,190 --> 00:45:11,520
So she associates people with
affection. But if you, you know,

817
00:45:11,550 --> 00:45:14,360
you're around a cat and you just go to
work all day and you barely pay attention

818
00:45:14,361 --> 00:45:17,910
to the fucking cat, then the cats like,
yeah, you can pat me down with you.

819
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:20,970
I got other shit to do. Yeah. So
it's all how the cat grows up.

820
00:45:20,971 --> 00:45:25,320
Bunnies are so cute that even their poop
is cute, but the problem is that high,

821
00:45:25,321 --> 00:45:27,120
that doesn't stay. You know,
that was on fear factor.

822
00:45:27,121 --> 00:45:28,500
We were trying to get
people to eat bunny poop.

823
00:45:28,501 --> 00:45:31,170
That was one of the things injected
by the network. That's bullshit.

824
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:34,020
Maybe they don't say
drink your own piss too.

825
00:45:34,021 --> 00:45:36,720
There was another one that the network
rejected rabbit shit don't stink.

826
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:40,740
My auntie in it, I would
totally eat it. Nonfat milk.

827
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:44,280
My ex girlfriend had a bunny and the
one thing I did notice the negative part

828
00:45:44,281 --> 00:45:47,010
was,
is that there was bunny shit everywhere.

829
00:45:47,070 --> 00:45:50,580
Like little rabbit turds everywhere to
come up with your hand there like raisins.

830
00:45:50,610 --> 00:45:51,130
Yeah.

831
00:45:51,130 --> 00:45:54,220
Yeah. Wow. How weird. I
love that motherfucker.

832
00:45:54,221 --> 00:45:55,930
I have a whole room dedicated to him.

833
00:45:56,470 --> 00:45:59,410
You have a room in your house dedicated
to all around. He's got a whole room.

834
00:45:59,411 --> 00:46:01,090
He doesn't even know he's captured.
I leave,

835
00:46:01,180 --> 00:46:03,580
I leave the gate open
because the gate goes around.

836
00:46:03,581 --> 00:46:05,980
Hold them cause we can't let him
chew the base board. So it's a room,

837
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:10,390
but there's a gate all the way around
in the room and we leave the gate open.

838
00:46:10,450 --> 00:46:13,170
He doesn't want to leave. He hates
leaving that motherfucker. I got up,

839
00:46:13,190 --> 00:46:16,020
I got a castle form. I
got a Ufo form. If a car,

840
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:18,600
Thomas Forum.
Yeah,

841
00:46:18,670 --> 00:46:23,290
you uh, you would make a great dad.
Dude. You don't even know the, the, the,

842
00:46:23,310 --> 00:46:26,640
the love that you have for this bunny
is pretty fun. It's interesting to see.

843
00:46:26,650 --> 00:46:30,490
But the love that you would have for a
kid would really freak you the fuck out.

844
00:46:31,060 --> 00:46:32,560
Be like,
fuck that bunny.

845
00:46:34,090 --> 00:46:36,990
The animals take a quick backseat deer.

846
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:39,360
Every woman that says that she has,

847
00:46:39,450 --> 00:46:43,440
I had, you know, I almost had, I
thought I had it there for a few months.

848
00:46:43,660 --> 00:46:47,400
You know that kid.
He's 15 now and um,

849
00:46:48,970 --> 00:46:49,803
mmm.

850
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:51,930
Not any want to talk about it.
Whoa.

851
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:54,980
Just opened up the door
and close it on people.

852
00:46:55,050 --> 00:46:56,540
Did you meet him at a bar or like,

853
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:57,280
yeah.

854
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:00,910
That's okay. No, I actually, look,

855
00:47:02,060 --> 00:47:06,470
what happened is I had an ex
girlfriend of mine when I was 26.

856
00:47:06,860 --> 00:47:09,860
She, uh, she got pregnant.
I thought it was by her.

857
00:47:10,950 --> 00:47:14,810
I thought her new boyfriend
got her pregnant, but it was,

858
00:47:14,811 --> 00:47:18,240
there was a kind of gray area when she
got pregnant. Like, Ooh, I think the,

859
00:47:18,470 --> 00:47:22,640
you know, maybe it could be mine. She had
a baby. Your sister calls me up and says,

860
00:47:22,641 --> 00:47:23,690
Hey,
Maretta had the baby.

861
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:25,753
MMM.

862
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:29,880
You should come down and check it out. It
could be yours. I'm like mine. She goes,

863
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:34,270
it looks kind of Mexican because she
knows what Thoreau family thought.

864
00:47:34,570 --> 00:47:39,220
It looked Mexican. So I came
down and I'm like, Oh my God,

865
00:47:40,130 --> 00:47:44,350
I'm, I have a son. I totally
didn't want it. We had broken
up with, they're like, oh,

866
00:47:44,351 --> 00:47:44,981
it was around nine,

867
00:47:44,981 --> 00:47:49,690
10 months ago or maybe longer and I didn't
want to have anything to do with her.

868
00:47:49,691 --> 00:47:51,520
I mean we were done.
I had a new girlfriend,

869
00:47:51,670 --> 00:47:54,430
I was moving on and now this kid
could be mine. I went to the hospital,

870
00:47:54,910 --> 00:47:57,580
looked at the kid and all babies
looked the same to me. I'm like,

871
00:47:57,581 --> 00:48:01,750
you guys think it looks Mexican? I don't
think like, yes, look, look at his face.

872
00:48:01,751 --> 00:48:05,440
I'm like, he looks like me. So I
go, let's take a DNA test then.

873
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:08,950
But you had to wait three months before
he could pull the amount of blood that

874
00:48:08,951 --> 00:48:11,650
you need to take the test.
So I had to wait three months.

875
00:48:11,651 --> 00:48:16,240
So I broke up with the girl that I was
with and as I said, this is my son.

876
00:48:16,241 --> 00:48:18,340
I want to be around for the
first three months, you know,

877
00:48:18,341 --> 00:48:23,140
so I'm going to treat him like my son.
So for three months he, he was my son.

878
00:48:23,141 --> 00:48:26,080
And by the third month when it was,
we were almost ready to take the test.

879
00:48:26,081 --> 00:48:29,890
I don't, I want him to him to be mine
so bad. I'm like, man, I got a son,

880
00:48:30,190 --> 00:48:35,020
he's three months. Let's do this. Like I
was ready to do it, let's go. And then he,

881
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:39,190
it turned out obviously that he wasn't
mine and I stuck around for a while and

882
00:48:39,191 --> 00:48:43,570
then me and me and me and
that the girlfriend broke
up a couple of times and we

883
00:48:43,571 --> 00:48:46,720
would separate them and come back and see
him cause I was in love with them. But,

884
00:48:46,721 --> 00:48:51,490
um, it was like a six month stretch when
I came back and he was around two after

885
00:48:51,491 --> 00:48:53,980
we'd break up, he's running to,
and when I got to the house,

886
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:57,610
he looked at me and he didn't recognize
me. She wasn't sure. And his mom was like,

887
00:48:57,611 --> 00:48:59,230
look,
he's the one who took you to the zoo.

888
00:48:59,380 --> 00:49:01,750
And we're looking to zoo pictures and
he's like looking at the zoo pictures and

889
00:49:01,751 --> 00:49:05,740
then look at me. And he's like,
he's maybe like a year and a half.

890
00:49:06,190 --> 00:49:09,340
And that look right there. I'm
like, man, I gotta I got a boat now.

891
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:12,220
Got Now's the time to do that.
He didn't even know who I am anymore.

892
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:15,520
I love this little kid. You
don't know who I am. I'm gone.

893
00:49:15,521 --> 00:49:19,750
So that was the guy in the
picture? No, he was in jail. Yeah.

894
00:49:19,751 --> 00:49:22,840
That guy was in jail. So
anyways, long story short,

895
00:49:23,770 --> 00:49:26,410
of course I think about him every
now and then. Like, you know,

896
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:30,580
I was in love with that kid. How would
it definitely, he's 15 now. He's 15 now.

897
00:49:30,581 --> 00:49:31,390
He's in Jujitsu.

898
00:49:31,390 --> 00:49:36,190
I found them on Facebook and I went
through all the names that it could be.

899
00:49:36,191 --> 00:49:38,890
I went through a bunch of guys and sent
them messages. I was like, you know what,

900
00:49:38,891 --> 00:49:43,870
I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm
gonna look for this guy. Wow.
So I found him. Holy Shit. So,

901
00:49:43,871 --> 00:49:47,880
uh, um, I thought, you know, we went back
and forth a little bit on Facebook and,

902
00:49:48,490 --> 00:49:52,510
and did you tell him the story?
No,

903
00:49:52,660 --> 00:49:55,450
we never talked about it. Whoa.
So he doesn't know. Now his mom,

904
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:58,810
his mom was remarried.
They got a little happy family going.

905
00:49:58,811 --> 00:50:01,330
I don't want to cause any
problems or anything like that.

906
00:50:01,331 --> 00:50:05,980
I just wanted to touch
base. And, um, I, you know,

907
00:50:05,981 --> 00:50:10,240
he doesn't, he lives like five or six
hours away up north and, and, and I, I,

908
00:50:11,110 --> 00:50:15,280
um, I got ahold of the nearest Jujitsu
school around where he lives in. I said,

909
00:50:15,281 --> 00:50:19,920
man, you'd be interested
in taking Jujitsu. It's a
paragon. It's a Jeff Glover.

910
00:50:19,940 --> 00:50:24,310
You know, Jeff Glover, some
paragon paragon affiliate,
got ahold of the guy. I said,

911
00:50:24,311 --> 00:50:28,340
um, you know, I told
everyone he's my nephew.

912
00:50:28,490 --> 00:50:31,850
I didn't really want to get into details.
It as really matter. He's not my nephew,

913
00:50:31,851 --> 00:50:34,670
but you know, I thought he was my son
for a while. I thought, you know what,

914
00:50:34,671 --> 00:50:38,240
I'm going to get them into Jujitsu. He's
all into it, man. He's obsessed. Oh Wow.

915
00:50:38,241 --> 00:50:42,350
That's awesome. Yeah. He's all facet that
he loves it, so, wow. What a crazy story.

916
00:50:43,100 --> 00:50:45,530
Did you ever think what would happen
if we decided to just stick around with

917
00:50:45,531 --> 00:50:50,060
that little dude? Yeah, man, I
do. I do. Because at that point,

918
00:50:51,230 --> 00:50:55,730
within those first three months,
that was my boy accurate. I'm like,

919
00:50:56,230 --> 00:51:00,350
like, you know, he was my son. I
thought this, he could be my son.

920
00:51:00,351 --> 00:51:01,184
I thought he could be

921
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:05,570
deep down. I was thinking, I mean
everyone says he looks like me.

922
00:51:05,571 --> 00:51:08,750
I don't think he looks like me. That's
it. Everyone's saying he looks Mexican.

923
00:51:08,790 --> 00:51:12,800
So funny. You know, I didn't
even know Eddie was Mexican.

924
00:51:12,801 --> 00:51:14,870
I thought he was fucking with
me for like the first two years.

925
00:51:14,871 --> 00:51:17,330
Cause at the comedy store you're
like, I'm half Mexican. I'm like, no,

926
00:51:17,331 --> 00:51:20,020
you're not Mexican or you said
something like that to me.

927
00:51:20,270 --> 00:51:22,190
He used to say he was having,
yeah.

928
00:51:22,220 --> 00:51:26,060
You said something else Japanese and
how fast or something like that. Yeah.

929
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:27,800
You said half Japanese.
Half Mexican.

930
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:28,400
Yeah.

931
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:33,310
I used to say that when I was a teenager
just because I was an idiot and I want

932
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:36,740
her to see who would believe it. And I'm
like, wow, the Ed people believe anything.

933
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:41,450
Did you use to do that with a lot of
things he used to like tell people crazy

934
00:51:41,451 --> 00:51:44,690
stories and see how far you can go
with it. Man, it's still happens,

935
00:51:44,691 --> 00:51:47,540
I think the whole, the
whole, the whole, uh,

936
00:51:48,410 --> 00:51:51,970
why do you get into doing that man?
Do you have a hard time not doing?

937
00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:52,391
If you look at,

938
00:51:52,391 --> 00:51:55,790
if you look at the [inaudible] and then
you look in and then you look at that,

939
00:51:55,791 --> 00:52:00,710
what we did on the Joe Show,
like with a 10 foot 10 foot screws,

940
00:52:00,770 --> 00:52:03,980
let me tell people, I don't know.
Let me tell you what we did.

941
00:52:04,310 --> 00:52:07,530
We were in Denver and I
was doing standup and uh,

942
00:52:07,610 --> 00:52:09,840
Eddie and Tate and Brian and Dunkin,

943
00:52:09,950 --> 00:52:14,090
we were all hanging out and we're
walking and we went through this little

944
00:52:14,450 --> 00:52:18,050
shopping area that, what does it, those
six street malls and what it's called,

945
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:20,330
whatever the mall is,
whatever street it is. Anyway,

946
00:52:20,331 --> 00:52:24,860
we're going to this downtown Shami here
and we see a wig store 2005 2005 was it?

947
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:29,450
And just as a goof we decided to go in
this wig store and then first of all we

948
00:52:29,451 --> 00:52:34,451
were high as fuck and somewhere in this
wig store we came up with the idea of

949
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:39,110
having a fake band and that you guys
were all going to wear these wigs. So we,

950
00:52:39,260 --> 00:52:40,071
everyone bought wigs.

951
00:52:40,071 --> 00:52:45,071
Tate had this crazy afro wig and you
had this crazy wig and everyone decided

952
00:52:45,831 --> 00:52:50,690
that we were going to play a band called
10 foot screws and we even announced

953
00:52:50,691 --> 00:52:54,200
the band like as having
an after party in town.

954
00:52:54,290 --> 00:52:58,370
So people thought that it was like
a real band and Eddie goes on stage,

955
00:52:58,550 --> 00:52:59,540
I get off stage,

956
00:52:59,570 --> 00:53:04,570
the show's over and he goes on stage
with his fucking wig on and sunglasses we

957
00:53:05,091 --> 00:53:07,800
have video of it's still right.
Yeah. Well there was a whole show.

958
00:53:09,980 --> 00:53:13,460
Which episode is it? Seven yeah.
How do people find that one?

959
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:17,960
Just type in Joe show seven, but you know,
all the episodes were on your website,

960
00:53:17,961 --> 00:53:20,810
but since you moved to servers now
everything is kind of weird. It was,

961
00:53:20,811 --> 00:53:22,520
there were probably
getting too much bandwidth.

962
00:53:23,420 --> 00:53:26,070
The premise of it was Joe

963
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:30,210
wanted to put together a reality show
based on him going to all these clubs

964
00:53:30,211 --> 00:53:35,010
across the nation and his
posse and me, Tate, Brian,

965
00:53:35,011 --> 00:53:39,610
Dunkin, Ari, even Larry back then we
were all as a producer when he got,

966
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:42,630
we were all in this,
that's what Joe show was.

967
00:53:42,631 --> 00:53:46,950
It was an actual origin of the word
powerful. When you hear me say powerful,

968
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:50,190
it's all because there's one dude,
our friend Lara. So the show,

969
00:53:50,191 --> 00:53:52,860
what was that called? The Joe
show. You had it on your website.

970
00:53:52,890 --> 00:53:57,890
We did about 11 or 12 episodes
or something and episode
seven we were in Denver.

971
00:53:58,111 --> 00:54:02,430
We were trying to come up with a pet
premise and then it was, it was all about,

972
00:54:02,820 --> 00:54:07,410
we just, we just formed a
band. So Joe's on stage and we,

973
00:54:07,411 --> 00:54:11,900
the way we sold it was Dunkin would
get on stage and we'd say, uh, uh,

974
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:15,140
who's going to the 10 foot screws
showed an I, that's what we call it,

975
00:54:15,141 --> 00:54:18,330
10 foot screws.
And that was Brian's idea.

976
00:54:18,750 --> 00:54:23,250
And so we wanted to, so Dunkin was
getting everybody in the audience use it.

977
00:54:23,251 --> 00:54:27,450
The fact that we got 10
foot screws backstage and
they're playing a big show at

978
00:54:27,451 --> 00:54:32,360
the boy with the holiday, the holiday
home next to me, I'll know sixth,

979
00:54:32,430 --> 00:54:35,340
three to know point logos. So people were
like, oh shit, there's a concert tonight.

980
00:54:35,341 --> 00:54:37,440
I didn't know about this 10 foot screws.
Are they big?

981
00:54:37,710 --> 00:54:40,360
So then it was already there too.
Who else are you wasn't very,

982
00:54:40,370 --> 00:54:42,540
wasn't there for Dunkin was
selling it like he would,

983
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:44,160
he was like the host
and he was selling it.

984
00:54:44,460 --> 00:54:47,220
We got 10 foot screws tomorrow we're
going to give away some tickets.

985
00:54:47,370 --> 00:54:51,720
So I've got a stack of half
off drinks on Tuesday night.

986
00:54:52,270 --> 00:54:56,250
I got a two stacks of them and Dunkin
introduced me. I was the lead singer,

987
00:54:56,251 --> 00:54:58,740
I was the total douchebag lead singer.

988
00:54:58,740 --> 00:55:03,410
I was like just basically playing the
singer of oasis, but backstage. So we,

989
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:08,010
I got up on stage and said, who wants
these tickets to the show tomorrow?

990
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:11,550
Backstage they were going nuts.
So like Paul Stanley,

991
00:55:11,551 --> 00:55:16,551
I divided the crowd to one side
and I said just I Paul static.

992
00:55:16,651 --> 00:55:20,420
Okay. This side, let me hear the noise.
Like a one to let me hear the noise. Ah.

993
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:22,650
And then I stopped him and I go this side,

994
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:27,450
it was just a total Paul Stanley in
1985 rip off. Most bands find that,

995
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:30,940
find that, find that in, queue it up.
Just that part of it. Because when I,

996
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:34,290
when I threw those tickets
into the audience too,

997
00:55:34,310 --> 00:55:39,310
were flying headfirst over tables that
we're scrambling only to find that number

998
00:55:39,570 --> 00:55:40,291
Tuesday night,

999
00:55:40,291 --> 00:55:45,150
half off drinks and use of
crazy man wearing a wig for
a band that doesn't exist.

1000
00:55:45,150 --> 00:55:49,740
Yes. So when the concert let out, people
had to walk by backstage. It was a weird,

1001
00:55:49,741 --> 00:55:50,491
the club was set up.

1002
00:55:50,491 --> 00:55:54,180
Weird word ever walking out
next to backstage and we
had the door open and dudes

1003
00:55:54,181 --> 00:55:57,280
are walking by gone, where's
that bad? So we were,

1004
00:55:57,281 --> 00:55:59,630
we grabbed one dude and we pulled,
we were,

1005
00:55:59,820 --> 00:56:02,370
we pulled in maybe three dudes
and we pulled him close the door.

1006
00:56:02,371 --> 00:56:07,270
Now they're backstage with 10 foot
screws and me and Tate are just huge bags

1007
00:56:07,490 --> 00:56:11,220
were total douche bag. Do you remember
those fucking questions you guys,

1008
00:56:11,221 --> 00:56:15,060
now that I'm thinking about it, it was
a great guy got down on his knees. Yes.

1009
00:56:16,020 --> 00:56:19,650
He wanted to. He was astounded.
Do whatever to hang out
with the band. He didn't,

1010
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:22,710
he thought we were a real band
so we got them to do crazy shit.

1011
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:24,070
He just wanted to hang

1012
00:56:24,070 --> 00:56:26,680
out with the bath. So we got, we're
going to have to get on your knees. Okay.

1013
00:56:26,770 --> 00:56:28,780
You're going to have to pray for
us. Pray with us like, you know,

1014
00:56:28,781 --> 00:56:32,320
band sometimes permitted up before
they go out. Thank you Jesus.

1015
00:56:32,321 --> 00:56:35,160
And he would replete, thank you Jesus.
And you said for this dig a hole.

1016
00:56:36,100 --> 00:56:40,210
And then he jumped up and
ran away and then Tate was,

1017
00:56:40,450 --> 00:56:43,750
he's like six foot four.
He was so intimidating to the guided one.

1018
00:56:43,751 --> 00:56:47,110
I like fire back, right. Just
takes sitting there looking
like a monster, you know,

1019
00:56:48,250 --> 00:56:52,270
he was scared and then we got girls that
he probably thought that you were about

1020
00:56:52,271 --> 00:56:55,730
to try to get him to suck your Dick.
And I keep really probably thought though,

1021
00:56:55,870 --> 00:56:58,690
I mean you think about it, you're
some fucking Wacko living in Colorado.

1022
00:56:58,691 --> 00:57:01,960
You know some dude who's willing to go
to some green room for some band that he

1023
00:57:01,961 --> 00:57:05,140
doesn't even know, never heard of
before, some van, it doesn't even exist.

1024
00:57:05,260 --> 00:57:07,240
He's on his knees praying back and forth.

1025
00:57:07,241 --> 00:57:10,450
You in his head when you said that
for this dictum about the saga,

1026
00:57:10,630 --> 00:57:14,830
he probably thought, oh, I fucked up.
I done fucked up. I'll do it, but damn,

1027
00:57:14,831 --> 00:57:18,760
I didn't. I'm not going to like it.
And that was a great episode two.

1028
00:57:18,790 --> 00:57:21,760
And then the other good episode
was when we were on Boston,

1029
00:57:22,090 --> 00:57:25,300
remember in Boston and
Ari salt or Aryan Dunkin,

1030
00:57:25,301 --> 00:57:28,840
they both sold to the audience to open
up and they said backstage where we're

1031
00:57:28,841 --> 00:57:32,080
auditioning for the Joe Rogan life
stories that they're going to film.

1032
00:57:32,350 --> 00:57:36,700
And we're looking for guys to play Joe
Rogan. We want authentic guys from Boston.

1033
00:57:36,940 --> 00:57:39,550
So the guys in the audience are thinking,
Oh shit,

1034
00:57:39,551 --> 00:57:42,970
they're auditioning to play for
play. Joe Rogan. I think I could do.

1035
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,060
You could do it, honey, you can do it.

1036
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:48,460
So people lined up and we had a
fake audition. Like I'm this bad.

1037
00:57:48,461 --> 00:57:51,990
I probably shouldn't talk
about this. Cause I think
what you did was illegal was,

1038
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:54,800
yeah, I'm pretty sure
we did. I'm sorry. Yeah,

1039
00:57:54,801 --> 00:57:58,700
we probably just didn't really happen.
We denied that. Yeah. Yeah. This,

1040
00:57:58,701 --> 00:58:03,060
this is all in another dimension. We deny
this. We deny this parallel university.

1041
00:58:03,070 --> 00:58:06,400
Bravo does not seek to get suited this
moment in time. This is all fiction.

1042
00:58:06,460 --> 00:58:09,730
Dunkin was the director never happened.
It never happened.

1043
00:58:10,310 --> 00:58:13,910
This didn't take place.
He can't timber saying it.

1044
00:58:15,250 --> 00:58:16,083
Probably.

1045
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:19,560
You just farted. No, I did not
know. I smell it too. No, I did not.

1046
00:58:19,830 --> 00:58:24,030
And we need some air conditioning happens.
Did you fart? He wouldn't do that.

1047
00:58:24,031 --> 00:58:27,600
What'd you, Eddie, listen,

1048
00:58:27,601 --> 00:58:30,660
this is not helping the podcasts at
all. Not one moment. Jewish. Sure.

1049
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:34,680
Seventies unfound double unfindable
when we have it somewhere. Right.

1050
00:58:35,110 --> 00:58:38,630
Did you Google it somewhere?
Yeah. It's not even on
googling, right. The, the, the,

1051
00:58:38,631 --> 00:58:41,640
the location it was on. It was on your
website. Do you have the raw video still?

1052
00:58:41,670 --> 00:58:43,050
I'm sure I do.
On batteries.

1053
00:58:44,350 --> 00:58:48,850
You might not have the chance
that you'd lost that forever.

1054
00:58:49,250 --> 00:58:52,920
Uh, Brian, how sad.

1055
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:56,630
I really doubt it. Well,
really, I have, I have,

1056
00:58:57,570 --> 00:59:01,710
I've had a hard drive die on me
reasonably. We need to find that man,

1057
00:59:01,711 --> 00:59:05,160
because that was a, that was a
classic for sure. Somebody saved it.

1058
00:59:05,220 --> 00:59:08,100
It's got to be someone out there that say,
I'm 100% sure I have it,

1059
00:59:08,190 --> 00:59:12,060
but it's just finding it. Those are those
things. Don't make me laugh anymore.

1060
00:59:12,061 --> 00:59:14,720
Those tricking people, things
like jackass type things. No,

1061
00:59:14,730 --> 00:59:16,800
I shouldn't say jackass,
like pumped type things.

1062
00:59:17,070 --> 00:59:19,710
They don't make me laugh anymore.
They used to make me laugh, you know?

1063
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:24,100
Oh, this guy's getting fucked over.
And like the Jamie Kennedy experiment,

1064
00:59:24,180 --> 00:59:28,160
I thought that show was hilarious.
Guy's gone nuts. Used to make me laugh.

1065
00:59:28,340 --> 00:59:29,870
But now I don't want to watch that stuff.

1066
00:59:30,110 --> 00:59:32,840
I don't want to watch people get lied to.
I remember what what it is.

1067
00:59:32,841 --> 00:59:37,550
I became a pussy. It became
super sensitive. I don't
like watching that. I'm like,

1068
00:59:37,551 --> 00:59:41,160
you know, you're taking
advantage of somebody for
entertainment. That's not even

1069
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:41,890
I like,

1070
00:59:41,890 --> 00:59:45,850
I like my poo Barry flashlight joke that
gets me every time somebody does that.

1071
00:59:45,851 --> 00:59:48,130
That was not very fleshlight.
Yeah. I told you this.

1072
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:52,540
I have a fleshlight at my house and
then this guy gave me this thing called

1073
00:59:52,541 --> 00:59:53,380
liquid ass.

1074
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:57,100
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You could bury.
You make people smell. You're fucked.

1075
00:59:57,210 --> 00:59:59,250
I don't make it. I'm just like,
hey, you should try it. Got It.

1076
00:59:59,251 --> 01:00:04,080
That new pair Coobury fleshlight smells
like blueberries. That's not that funny.

1077
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:07,560
It is funny when you see him
doing it though. I've seen
it. I've seen it on video.

1078
01:00:07,980 --> 01:00:11,060
You think in real life it's funnier just
cause you get to watch the real sick.

1079
01:00:12,010 --> 01:00:14,580
It makes me giggle.
Smell making some,

1080
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:18,000
seeing somebody's face when they're
smelling poop. Just make me laugh.

1081
01:00:18,060 --> 01:00:19,200
That kind of shit.
You used to take photos.

1082
01:00:19,620 --> 01:00:22,340
It doesn't make me laugh as much anymore.
The premise has got to be good.

1083
01:00:22,380 --> 01:00:23,790
If there's a good promise,
you can't just,

1084
01:00:23,910 --> 01:00:28,520
it's gotta be deep and good and
it's the best one recently is it?

1085
01:00:28,521 --> 01:00:31,830
But you know Jason Tebow, his girlfriend
Danielle, uh, she never did it,

1086
01:00:31,831 --> 01:00:33,810
so she opened it up and she smelled it.
She was like,

1087
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:36,240
oh that smells like a homeless person's
underwear or something like that.

1088
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:37,620
And then I'm like,
put your finger in it.

1089
01:00:37,621 --> 01:00:40,830
And I had just poured a new fresh
thing of liquid ass inside of it.

1090
01:00:40,950 --> 01:00:44,400
So she puts her finger and gets all
over her hand and her whole and was like

1091
01:00:44,401 --> 01:00:45,234
poop.

1092
01:00:45,570 --> 01:00:49,860
You're 12 years old. This is 36 years
old. Can you believe that? A 36 year old,

1093
01:00:49,861 --> 01:00:52,530
12 year old, let me see your Id. No.

1094
01:00:53,570 --> 01:00:56,910
Aligna it's motherfuckers
going to be dressing up like
Winnie the Pooh next week,

1095
01:00:57,240 --> 01:00:59,160
banging his girlfriend in
a room full of strangers.

1096
01:01:00,810 --> 01:01:03,150
She's going to be just up
like a little Fox. Would you,

1097
01:01:03,210 --> 01:01:06,220
would you admit though that that's
going to be interesting to see? Oh yeah.

1098
01:01:06,390 --> 01:01:09,870
Listen, I would go no doubt about
it. Especially if, you know,

1099
01:01:09,871 --> 01:01:14,010
I knew for sure that the crotch and
the ass of mite thing was zipped up.

1100
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:17,010
Nobody could get at me.
Right. You know? I would go,

1101
01:01:17,070 --> 01:01:18,780
I would just think they'd be crazy though,
man.

1102
01:01:18,930 --> 01:01:21,540
I think they just do take shit
to each other and they just like,

1103
01:01:22,110 --> 01:01:24,090
it can get like really uncomfortable.

1104
01:01:24,150 --> 01:01:26,070
I think some of them are
probably pretty normal,

1105
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:29,640
but I think whenever you get
an opportunity to completely
pretend to be somebody

1106
01:01:29,641 --> 01:01:32,730
else, you get to dress up in
some outfit. You don't even talk.

1107
01:01:32,731 --> 01:01:37,110
Everyone agrees to not talk. You get
to see like how wacky some minds are.

1108
01:01:37,260 --> 01:01:40,460
Some people's brains are fucking
fried, you know, and you,

1109
01:01:40,461 --> 01:01:43,140
you kind of put yourself at the mercy of
being around those people without being

1110
01:01:43,141 --> 01:01:45,260
able to filter them socially.
You know,

1111
01:01:45,330 --> 01:01:48,630
if we're all sitting around
talking after five, 10 minutes,

1112
01:01:48,631 --> 01:01:52,530
we all kind of figured out how
we're each others vibes coming from.

1113
01:01:52,700 --> 01:01:54,840
Even like do something that surprises us.
You know,

1114
01:01:54,870 --> 01:01:56,640
you find out someone's a little
weirder than you thought,

1115
01:01:56,850 --> 01:02:00,330
but for the most part you get a kind
of vibe and some people get a vibe

1116
01:02:00,331 --> 01:02:02,700
immediately. Okay, I don't
want to talk to that guy. Well,

1117
01:02:02,701 --> 01:02:05,490
when that guy's dressed up like Wiley,
coyote, you don't ever get that vibe.

1118
01:02:05,550 --> 01:02:06,890
Yeah,
you're going to have that one Wiley,

1119
01:02:06,900 --> 01:02:11,790
coyote guy walking around
creeping everybody out. Maybe
that's what excites them.

1120
01:02:11,890 --> 01:02:14,010
Fuck yeah, I bet a lot of them. Look,

1121
01:02:14,050 --> 01:02:16,690
I think that would be like a
great thing for a serial killer.

1122
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:20,220
A great thing for serial killer would
be go and hang around with a bunch of

1123
01:02:20,221 --> 01:02:23,220
other people that are dressing up
like this fucking Weirdo outfit.

1124
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:26,760
You know this Weirdo animal thing and
you could wear one of those weird animal

1125
01:02:26,761 --> 01:02:30,450
things and just infiltrate them and then
hang out with them and a way that other

1126
01:02:30,451 --> 01:02:33,420
people are never willing to hang
out with two bunnies. Serial killer.

1127
01:02:34,510 --> 01:02:37,710
I don't like. I would assume that most
serial killers like you are around them.

1128
01:02:37,711 --> 01:02:39,960
You'd be tripped out by them.
Like most of them.

1129
01:02:39,961 --> 01:02:42,810
Like you would get a weird vibe
from them. Most of them, right?

1130
01:02:42,811 --> 01:02:43,644
Wouldn't you assume?

1131
01:02:43,860 --> 01:02:46,980
I mean you think that serial killers
would be able to just like sneak on by Ya

1132
01:02:46,981 --> 01:02:48,780
or do you think you would get
like a weird vibe from him?

1133
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:50,810
I think I would definitely be able
to get a weird vibe from somebody,

1134
01:02:50,820 --> 01:02:54,120
but then of course I have no idea. You
have no idea. Right. It's all speculation.

1135
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:56,131
A lot of friends,

1136
01:02:56,131 --> 01:02:58,890
the more friends you have and the
more people you come in contact with,

1137
01:02:59,430 --> 01:03:00,960
you can spot those in a second.

1138
01:03:00,961 --> 01:03:04,830
Like people that look at ideas all
the time and spot them. Fake ones,

1139
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:09,120
good ones all day. Yeah.
This one's different. It's
different. It's not the same.

1140
01:03:09,330 --> 01:03:09,931
Yeah,
you're right.

1141
01:03:09,931 --> 01:03:12,900
If you have a bunch of different friends
and you run a bunch of people and if

1142
01:03:12,901 --> 01:03:15,750
you're honest,
that to me I think is the big one.

1143
01:03:15,870 --> 01:03:19,140
If you're a real honest person and
you're honest and the way you communicate

1144
01:03:19,141 --> 01:03:19,974
with people,

1145
01:03:20,370 --> 01:03:24,960
you can see you pick up deceptive behavior
very quickly because it just seems

1146
01:03:24,961 --> 01:03:28,110
off. You have your guard down,
you're relaxed, you're open,

1147
01:03:28,290 --> 01:03:31,710
and then you see something
that's like just not quite real.

1148
01:03:31,950 --> 01:03:35,100
I just something about what you're
saying. It seems like bullshit. You know?

1149
01:03:35,170 --> 01:03:39,040
I think psychedelics also helps that
sense too because you actually see the

1150
01:03:39,041 --> 01:03:43,090
person's inner soul at certain points of
doing psychedelics where you could see

1151
01:03:43,091 --> 01:03:46,750
their energy and ever since he see
that or that feel, that feeling,

1152
01:03:46,751 --> 01:03:48,940
I think he kind of have that
feeling in the back of your,

1153
01:03:49,660 --> 01:03:51,650
do you ever go to the movies when
you're high? Yeah, of course.

1154
01:03:51,950 --> 01:03:55,470
You know how when you can tell that
they're acting bad. Dude, I want,

1155
01:03:55,480 --> 01:03:58,700
I saw the hulk, the Eric Bana Hawk
and Eric Ban is a great actor.

1156
01:03:58,701 --> 01:04:00,520
Don't get me wrong,
he's in the movie chopper.

1157
01:04:00,560 --> 01:04:02,090
He's a bad motherfucker in that movie.

1158
01:04:02,360 --> 01:04:06,140
But in the Hawk there was some scenes
where you didn't really have much to do

1159
01:04:06,141 --> 01:04:08,720
and it didn't seem like he was
the most focused, you know,

1160
01:04:08,721 --> 01:04:11,600
there's a few scenes where
him and this chick or talking,

1161
01:04:11,810 --> 01:04:15,980
and I'm listening to the two of them
talking about like if this is so not real,

1162
01:04:16,340 --> 01:04:17,920
like I remember in the
movie theater going,

1163
01:04:17,930 --> 01:04:22,250
this is like some of the worst acting
ever. This is so fake it seems like,

1164
01:04:22,251 --> 01:04:24,290
so you're not committed
to what you're saying.

1165
01:04:24,291 --> 01:04:26,030
You're not thinking
about what you're saying,

1166
01:04:26,330 --> 01:04:29,960
but it's because the weed that we just
lets you tune into it, you know? But it's,

1167
01:04:29,961 --> 01:04:32,270
it's that way with the conversation
too. You ever, you know,

1168
01:04:32,271 --> 01:04:34,150
you've been high before when you,

1169
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:37,850
you feel like someone's lying to you
and to you it feels like even more so,

1170
01:04:38,090 --> 01:04:42,410
it's even more shocking and weird if
you're, if you're vulnerable and you're,

1171
01:04:42,411 --> 01:04:43,250
you know,
a little high,

1172
01:04:43,251 --> 01:04:46,830
maybe he had to touch a paranoia and
then you realize it's someone's lying.

1173
01:04:46,831 --> 01:04:51,410
He like, they just feels
fucking gross. Yes,

1174
01:04:51,710 --> 01:04:55,890
yes, yes it is. Thinking about
bunnies or anything about that.

1175
01:04:57,230 --> 01:05:00,680
I don't know how to break this to
you though. But these are fake bro.

1176
01:05:03,780 --> 01:05:07,540
Dude, dude, I got it from amazon.com
okay. Guaranteed. It's legit.

1177
01:05:08,190 --> 01:05:12,980
Get it from Peru. Conspiracy theory.
Crystal Skull. That's big foot.

1178
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:14,850
Oh no big fuss on a battle on a man.

1179
01:05:14,900 --> 01:05:16,820
You know there's an animal
channel show right now.

1180
01:05:17,040 --> 01:05:19,810
It's sort of finding big foot or
something like that on the animal planet

1181
01:05:19,900 --> 01:05:21,010
or animal channel.

1182
01:05:21,011 --> 01:05:25,860
I've seen the commercials because on one
video was in Spokane this past weekend,

1183
01:05:25,861 --> 01:05:29,200
and, and as we're landing on the Spokane
airport, you know, you're, you're,

1184
01:05:29,201 --> 01:05:33,610
you're looking at all like the forest
and the pine trees and, and you know,

1185
01:05:33,611 --> 01:05:35,490
I started thinking about
Saas, squash them. Like,

1186
01:05:35,500 --> 01:05:38,590
I'm going to ask the guys at my
seminar what they think, you know.

1187
01:05:38,910 --> 01:05:43,090
So in the beginning of summer, I go by
show of hands, who believes in Sasquatch?

1188
01:05:43,900 --> 01:05:47,740
Nobody to school. The Edy's
running. This is how he starts off.

1189
01:05:48,580 --> 01:05:52,810
I wanted to, I want them
to know this. Nobody raised
their hand. So I'm like, Shit,

1190
01:05:52,811 --> 01:05:56,740
none of you guys believe in Sasquatches
holy shits. I'm thinking right there.

1191
01:05:56,741 --> 01:06:00,820
Okay. If these people live here in
Spokane, small city in the woods,

1192
01:06:01,060 --> 01:06:04,840
if they don't believe it, then a couple
of guys start going, well, you know,

1193
01:06:04,841 --> 01:06:07,420
you never know because of this one,
because of I go, wait a minute.

1194
01:06:07,421 --> 01:06:10,960
So you're saying you kind of believe
it? And I go, okay, by show of hands,

1195
01:06:10,990 --> 01:06:15,280
who thinks that maybe they exist?
They all raised their hands. Whoa.

1196
01:06:15,370 --> 01:06:16,960
They all I go,
really?

1197
01:06:17,260 --> 01:06:19,930
They just didn't want to raise their
hands initially because they didn't want,

1198
01:06:19,931 --> 01:06:22,150
you know, they would probably ridiculed
in school. Well, here's some new,

1199
01:06:23,160 --> 01:06:23,430
there's some

1200
01:06:23,430 --> 01:06:24,400
weird facts.
First of all,

1201
01:06:24,401 --> 01:06:27,720
there's 250 different native
American names for Sasquatch,

1202
01:06:28,080 --> 01:06:33,080
250 different names for this big hairy
man that lives in the woods and the pro

1203
01:06:34,350 --> 01:06:38,640
primary, uh, the, the big
predominant, you know,

1204
01:06:38,700 --> 01:06:42,180
a group of sightings is
in the Pacific northwest.

1205
01:06:42,460 --> 01:06:46,260
You think if they had the internet back
then one back then I won't be one name.

1206
01:06:46,261 --> 01:06:50,100
Right. That's 250 people talked about
it and they all made it their own name.

1207
01:06:50,130 --> 01:06:54,390
Well, no, they had a bunch of
different languages to squash the best.

1208
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:58,600
That's the Indian name. I Sasquatch.
Like Henry. Yeah. Well, the, the,

1209
01:06:58,760 --> 01:07:02,940
the reason why it's interesting is because
so many different names exist for it

1210
01:07:02,941 --> 01:07:07,590
because of there's no other, um,
mythical creatures in the, uh, the, uh,

1211
01:07:07,620 --> 01:07:10,030
native American, um, like, uh,

1212
01:07:10,490 --> 01:07:14,760
I don't think they have like a mythology
that has like maybe different Indians

1213
01:07:14,761 --> 01:07:17,670
do and some of them do and some don't.
But for the most part,

1214
01:07:17,671 --> 01:07:18,630
I don't think it's like,
you know,

1215
01:07:18,631 --> 01:07:21,120
the Greeks had all these fake gods
and all these different, you know,

1216
01:07:21,121 --> 01:07:23,550
the griffins and all these different
things that they had created.

1217
01:07:23,551 --> 01:07:25,320
There was obviously a
lot of fiction going on.

1218
01:07:25,620 --> 01:07:28,680
I don't think there's that much fiction
in the native American folklore.

1219
01:07:29,370 --> 01:07:32,460
So when there's all these different names
for this one animal, it makes you go,

1220
01:07:32,490 --> 01:07:35,310
hmm, maybe there was a thing
like that at one point in time.

1221
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:38,970
And then there's so many fucking sightings
of these things and that makes you go,

1222
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,400
hmm, maybe, well, what
the fuck would it be?

1223
01:07:41,850 --> 01:07:43,800
How could there be an ape
that no one's ever heard of?

1224
01:07:44,040 --> 01:07:46,860
Then you find out that it's not an ape.
It's no one's ever heard of it.

1225
01:07:46,861 --> 01:07:49,230
There actually was an eight foot tall,

1226
01:07:49,290 --> 01:07:54,290
erect giant ape called Gi do epiphysis
that actually lived in Asia and lived in

1227
01:07:55,021 --> 01:07:56,940
Asia as recently as 100,000 years ago.

1228
01:07:57,120 --> 01:08:01,470
And they think that this thing may have
calmed down the Bering Strait along with

1229
01:08:01,471 --> 01:08:03,720
American or along with
native Americans rather.

1230
01:08:03,870 --> 01:08:07,740
When people first came to America,
America 10,000 years ago,

1231
01:08:07,770 --> 01:08:10,380
half of North America was
under a mile high sheet of ice.

1232
01:08:11,010 --> 01:08:16,010
So there was a connection actually
between us and Russia and Asia and animals

1233
01:08:16,071 --> 01:08:18,050
would come across that connection,
the Bering strait.

1234
01:08:18,080 --> 01:08:19,970
And that's how people supposedly got here.

1235
01:08:20,210 --> 01:08:22,970
And they think that it's very
possible that at one point in time,

1236
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:27,470
this now extinct animal that they
know exists, made that trip as well.

1237
01:08:27,500 --> 01:08:31,210
This animal, they say it's definitely
existed. It wasn't 100% exists.

1238
01:08:31,280 --> 01:08:35,570
It's called tall person or no, it's called
gigantic [inaudible]. They have, um,

1239
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:36,071
they,
they,

1240
01:08:36,071 --> 01:08:41,071
they found this thing because they found
an extraordinarily large tooth and a

1241
01:08:42,170 --> 01:08:45,020
one of these Chinese
market somewhere. And, uh,

1242
01:08:45,140 --> 01:08:48,050
it was a tooth that they
knew as a primate tooth,

1243
01:08:48,230 --> 01:08:51,860
but it was so large they couldn't
believe that, you know, it was a humans.

1244
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:54,800
And so they've tried to figure out what
it was early man, what the fuck it was.

1245
01:08:55,100 --> 01:08:57,370
And then they found some
other bones and then, uh,

1246
01:08:57,380 --> 01:09:01,370
eventually discovered that there was an
actual animal called gigantic epiphysis.

1247
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:06,220
Hmm. So what about the argument that
you don't find bones are, you know,

1248
01:09:06,230 --> 01:09:10,310
500 errors either man, you don't
find dead bears who wants the bone?

1249
01:09:10,370 --> 01:09:12,470
If there's a small population of them,

1250
01:09:13,140 --> 01:09:16,790
if there's a small population of them
and one of them died, things that die,

1251
01:09:16,820 --> 01:09:19,640
there's a video,
a time lapse video of Africa,

1252
01:09:19,641 --> 01:09:22,820
which is obviously much more
predatory than the Pacific northwest.

1253
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:25,220
But in this time lapse video of Africa,

1254
01:09:25,250 --> 01:09:29,900
an elephant dies and these hyenas
start tearing this elephant apart.

1255
01:09:29,930 --> 01:09:31,010
And even some,
uh,

1256
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:35,930
some lions actually scavenged a little
bit if the thing's gone and three days in

1257
01:09:35,931 --> 01:09:38,990
72 hours is gone. There's
nothing, nothing exists.

1258
01:09:39,230 --> 01:09:42,140
And it's a fucking elephant cause
hitting in the bone, everything,

1259
01:09:42,170 --> 01:09:45,440
they're all just chewing everything up.
They all just take things away.

1260
01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:47,930
The hyenas cause smash bones,
hyenas,

1261
01:09:47,950 --> 01:09:51,020
they have like some of the most
powerful bites in the animal kingdom.

1262
01:09:51,021 --> 01:09:54,110
And the reason why is cause
they're scavengers. They
smashed bones and you know,

1263
01:09:54,140 --> 01:09:57,680
bite off chunks of meat from the bones.
I mean, those are just ruthless cont.

1264
01:09:57,920 --> 01:10:01,100
They're just there. They're the fucking
total cons of the animal kingdom.

1265
01:10:01,310 --> 01:10:06,290
They're just mean, vicious fucking
horrible animals that screech and laugh.

1266
01:10:06,530 --> 01:10:09,200
And the females are larger than the males.

1267
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:11,510
The reason being is because
the males are so evil.

1268
01:10:11,511 --> 01:10:15,140
They eat their babies all the time. So
to keep the males from eating the babies,

1269
01:10:15,141 --> 01:10:19,220
the females have to be larger than the
males. And the females have a fake Dick.

1270
01:10:19,730 --> 01:10:24,380
They have a giant full penis and they
mount the males and dominate them with

1271
01:10:24,381 --> 01:10:25,280
this fake deck.

1272
01:10:26,540 --> 01:10:29,540
It's a giant like arm hanging
from between their legs.

1273
01:10:29,541 --> 01:10:31,430
It's the creepiest shit you've ever seen.

1274
01:10:31,640 --> 01:10:36,080
This giant female who's bigger than the
male humps the mail and dominates him.

1275
01:10:36,081 --> 01:10:39,430
It's a matriarchal society.
I want to fake Dick you,

1276
01:10:39,930 --> 01:10:42,350
you kinda real one though.
Brian went to,

1277
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:46,100
if you look up gigantic mythic as
though they have skulls in this thing.

1278
01:10:46,101 --> 01:10:48,960
I didn't even know about that.
I thought it was just like a cave man.

1279
01:10:49,160 --> 01:10:51,860
Well you know they don't
have a full skull, you know,

1280
01:10:51,861 --> 01:10:54,770
but they have enough that they piece
together what it would look like.

1281
01:10:55,040 --> 01:11:00,040
You know they have bones and various
parts of jaws and second video that didn't

1282
01:11:00,260 --> 01:11:02,450
exist anymore.
They probably don't exist anymore.

1283
01:11:02,680 --> 01:11:06,560
They probably did exist like maybe even
just a few hundred years ago and they'd

1284
01:11:06,561 --> 01:11:09,260
probably died off or there might
be a few of them out there.

1285
01:11:09,261 --> 01:11:11,900
It's really possible.
The thing if you went to Spokane,

1286
01:11:11,901 --> 01:11:14,130
you know that as you fly
over that Pacific northwest,

1287
01:11:14,460 --> 01:11:17,520
it really occurs to you how
fucking dense that shit is.

1288
01:11:17,820 --> 01:11:21,390
There is so much forest up there. It's
hard for you to wrap your head around.

1289
01:11:21,540 --> 01:11:25,740
It's hard for you to wrap your head
around over an hour of flying through the

1290
01:11:25,741 --> 01:11:28,710
air and it's still forest and
that's what it is up there.

1291
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:31,020
I mean in some dense dense shit.

1292
01:11:31,140 --> 01:11:36,140
So if you think that they've absolutely
done a a survey and an account of

1293
01:11:36,601 --> 01:11:39,750
everything that lives in that forest,
you're crazy. There's no way they have,

1294
01:11:39,990 --> 01:11:44,520
they just killed the fucking a Jaguar
or a panther rather in Connecticut.

1295
01:11:44,970 --> 01:11:49,540
They thought that there was no panthers
on the east coast for a long time. They,

1296
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:53,370
I think the last one I believed that
killed a New Hampshire and like the 18

1297
01:11:53,371 --> 01:11:56,490
hundreds, you know the, when they, uh,
the settlers first came to the east coast,

1298
01:11:56,491 --> 01:11:58,290
they eradicated most
of the mountain lions,

1299
01:11:58,650 --> 01:12:03,040
but they just killed one in Connecticut,
140 pounder and they saw it.

1300
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:07,530
There was a spotting of one in a New
York 20 miles away from that could have

1301
01:12:07,531 --> 01:12:09,540
been the same panther
because they've known,

1302
01:12:09,570 --> 01:12:12,510
they're known to travel like a
hundred miles in a day sometimes.

1303
01:12:12,660 --> 01:12:15,150
So it could have been the same
panther that went 20 miles away.

1304
01:12:15,570 --> 01:12:19,050
But you don't know where this thing
came from. It could have been a pet,

1305
01:12:19,160 --> 01:12:20,220
he could have been a pet,

1306
01:12:20,280 --> 01:12:22,890
but it also could have been something
that was living in the fucking woods.

1307
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:27,210
It's really possible. They did use to
exist and there are so hard to find men.

1308
01:12:27,330 --> 01:12:31,770
You know, I saw one where when I
lived in Colorado, but you know, it's,

1309
01:12:31,830 --> 01:12:34,080
it's fairly rare to see one,
you know,

1310
01:12:34,170 --> 01:12:36,900
I've talked to people who lived in
Colorado for years. He never saw one,

1311
01:12:37,140 --> 01:12:38,700
but there's plenty of people that have,

1312
01:12:38,820 --> 01:12:43,020
but they've got a documented population
of thousands of mountain lions up there.

1313
01:12:43,350 --> 01:12:46,200
You know, it's not like they're
scarce, they're just kind of crafty.

1314
01:12:46,410 --> 01:12:50,520
They're crafty animals and that's way
more populated than the Pacific northwest.

1315
01:12:50,760 --> 01:12:54,300
You know, if you're living in a place
like, like you know, Spokane or,

1316
01:12:54,390 --> 01:12:56,910
or any of those areas where they
have those Sasquatch sightings,

1317
01:12:56,911 --> 01:13:00,540
it's always like northern California.
It's always like the rain forest man.

1318
01:13:01,290 --> 01:13:05,820
There's some fucking sounds that these
guys have recorded and it could be hoaxes,

1319
01:13:06,060 --> 01:13:10,300
but people who have studied these sounds
like primatologist have studied these

1320
01:13:10,310 --> 01:13:12,450
sounds. They said their
primate in nature, you know,

1321
01:13:12,451 --> 01:13:13,620
they don't know what the fuck it is,

1322
01:13:13,720 --> 01:13:16,630
but these guys are camping out in the
woods and they hear these screams and he

1323
01:13:16,631 --> 01:13:18,930
screeches and the night,
who knows?

1324
01:13:19,260 --> 01:13:22,710
The thing that has me curious is that
there's an actual animal and there's

1325
01:13:22,711 --> 01:13:25,440
pictures of this thing. Look
at this. This is, this is a,

1326
01:13:25,630 --> 01:13:28,740
it depends because I mean look at it.
It's God damn big foot man. I mean,

1327
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:30,900
the real animal is a big foot.

1328
01:13:31,120 --> 01:13:35,280
It's an animal that absolutely existed
that that hooks us based off of probably.

1329
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:40,200
It could be. They could be, it could be.
It could very well be a hoax for sure.

1330
01:13:40,230 --> 01:13:43,670
Or it could be, there's a big fucking
ape out there, but the thing is,

1331
01:13:43,860 --> 01:13:47,160
if it did exist, brow, here's the
thing. If that fucking thing existed,

1332
01:13:47,340 --> 01:13:50,760
it would be in a cage right next to the
gorilla at the zoo and nobody would give

1333
01:13:50,761 --> 01:13:55,530
a fuck. It's because it's a mystery
that's so intoxicating to people.

1334
01:13:55,680 --> 01:13:59,220
We have this weird thing where
we want things that are secret.

1335
01:13:59,221 --> 01:14:03,480
We want things that we don't know yet.
Oh, I don't know. Is it real? Is it real?

1336
01:14:03,570 --> 01:14:05,400
And we want to uncover
these fucking secrets,

1337
01:14:05,401 --> 01:14:10,140
his deep desire to do that more
than to accumulate knowledge.

1338
01:14:10,290 --> 01:14:15,290
Like people have a much stronger desire
to find secrets like ghosts or something

1339
01:14:15,401 --> 01:14:19,390
retarded like that. Like who the fuck
cares? It goes, have never killed anybody,

1340
01:14:19,391 --> 01:14:22,060
you know, you know, you don't get
anything from goes see, you know,

1341
01:14:22,061 --> 01:14:24,580
you can't record them on film.
Everybody that sees them,

1342
01:14:24,581 --> 01:14:27,340
they all sound like they're full of shit.
You know, you really believe in ghosts,

1343
01:14:27,341 --> 01:14:30,130
man. You're going to dedicate
your time to go say theirs.

1344
01:14:30,170 --> 01:14:33,910
But I was going to say is when there's
all this shit out there that is real and

1345
01:14:33,911 --> 01:14:37,600
it's fascinating, some incredible
shit, the discovery, you know,

1346
01:14:37,601 --> 01:14:41,230
they believe that there may be small
black holes traveling through our galaxy

1347
01:14:41,350 --> 01:14:43,570
and that can pass right through the sun.

1348
01:14:43,980 --> 01:14:47,110
That can go through the sun
and we wouldn't even notice it.

1349
01:14:47,200 --> 01:14:49,990
We would still be a little blip,
little blip out there,

1350
01:14:50,110 --> 01:14:51,670
and they would just pass
right through the son.

1351
01:14:52,210 --> 01:14:55,600
They know that there's a fucking RV sides,
uh,

1352
01:14:55,601 --> 01:14:59,230
asteroids that just whizzed by our planet.
Just the other day,

1353
01:14:59,410 --> 01:15:04,410
just yesterday I think it was like
really close between us and the moon went

1354
01:15:04,451 --> 01:15:08,620
fucking flying by in the same orbit,
the same place as satellites are.

1355
01:15:08,650 --> 01:15:11,950
That's how close it was. It's
RV sized. I mean, you know,

1356
01:15:11,951 --> 01:15:14,440
that's pretty small as far
as as far as asteroids go.

1357
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:17,130
But if it hit it hit a city
or something like that. Yeah,

1358
01:15:17,160 --> 01:15:20,230
but that would have gone through
our r whatever atmosphere,

1359
01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:22,960
atmosphere burnt out maybe.
It depends on what it's made out of.

1360
01:15:23,110 --> 01:15:26,350
They don't all burnout. The really scary
ones. The ones that are made out of iron,

1361
01:15:26,740 --> 01:15:29,350
you know, there's some, there's
some that are made, I mean comments.

1362
01:15:29,351 --> 01:15:32,740
When you see the trail of a comment
that's cause it's mostly ice, you know,

1363
01:15:32,741 --> 01:15:33,440
that's water.

1364
01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:37,900
That's w there's so much fucking water
and comments at that trail is actually

1365
01:15:37,901 --> 01:15:41,650
the, the water vapor like coming
off this giant fucking hunk of ice.

1366
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:45,490
Those are not nearly as terrifying as
the ones that are all iron. You know,

1367
01:15:45,491 --> 01:15:48,550
the ones that are all water and all
sorts of other other shit, you know,

1368
01:15:48,610 --> 01:15:51,700
as they're getting close. A lot of
it's going to go away. But you know,

1369
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:56,020
even when it blows up in the atmosphere,
even when it erodes in the atmosphere,

1370
01:15:56,170 --> 01:15:59,380
sometimes it still produces insane damage,
man.

1371
01:15:59,680 --> 01:16:04,270
Like there's an area of the Soviet
Union that was hit by a meteor in,

1372
01:16:04,360 --> 01:16:07,810
I think it was the turn of the century
and it's called Tom Guskey, you know,

1373
01:16:07,811 --> 01:16:08,351
that's the,
uh,

1374
01:16:08,351 --> 01:16:13,351
the area and there's photos of just
flat and miles and miles of trees.

1375
01:16:14,201 --> 01:16:15,910
I mean,
it just as fucked,

1376
01:16:15,911 --> 01:16:20,911
like they got hit by a nuclear bomb
man and there was no actual asteroid.

1377
01:16:21,190 --> 01:16:24,520
By the time it got to earth,
it had been eaten up by the atmosphere.

1378
01:16:25,500 --> 01:16:27,120
Those fucking things are terrifying,
man.

1379
01:16:28,020 --> 01:16:29,850
I want to know if it goes kills that goes,

1380
01:16:30,120 --> 01:16:32,550
then you die and you're on
the same level as the go is,

1381
01:16:32,551 --> 01:16:35,610
can you think kill that goes,
then he goes into another ghost level.

1382
01:16:35,790 --> 01:16:38,340
You mean if a ghost kills a person,
you become a ghost. Can you check that?

1383
01:16:38,341 --> 01:16:41,430
Go Sas for killing you? Yeah. And then
you kill the ghostmen ghost world.

1384
01:16:41,550 --> 01:16:44,970
You can't kill Gusto. Yeah, but
so there was no dine in a movie.

1385
01:16:45,750 --> 01:16:48,840
That's the thing about ghosts. That's
so scary. You can like get rid of them.

1386
01:16:48,841 --> 01:16:51,360
If you have a good priest,
a good priest who loves his mother,

1387
01:16:52,140 --> 01:16:55,740
but if you don't have that the fuck man,
you can't even can't kill him.

1388
01:16:55,860 --> 01:16:58,800
You have to be able to kill a ghost and
the ghost level cause then that has to

1389
01:16:58,801 --> 01:17:02,310
be a third ghost thing.
You can't kill him, Bro.

1390
01:17:02,430 --> 01:17:05,790
That goes level would be really
crowded. Then it goes, who's that?

1391
01:17:05,791 --> 01:17:07,110
They have to trick you on a dime.

1392
01:17:07,140 --> 01:17:09,890
You have to like get scared and
fall down flights, stairs and shit.

1393
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:12,620
You have to get scared back up
into an open elevator shaft.

1394
01:17:12,621 --> 01:17:16,780
That's how ghosts kill you. They can't
really do shit. They're just bluffers.

1395
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:21,720
You know what's funny? This goes hunters
is a real TV show. It's about one one.

1396
01:17:21,850 --> 01:17:25,460
This is like a bunch of his more than
one too. There's a ton of ghost shows.

1397
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:27,980
There's a ton of go shows and
they're all exactly the same.

1398
01:17:28,130 --> 01:17:31,190
It's all three stupid white people and
occasionally there's a black guy with

1399
01:17:31,191 --> 01:17:35,030
glasses and they're in a basement and they
have night vision on and then they go,

1400
01:17:35,060 --> 01:17:35,893
did you hear that?

1401
01:17:36,040 --> 01:17:39,500
Sh and they cut the commercial and
then they play music and be like,

1402
01:17:39,501 --> 01:17:42,990
why are you playing music? Cut that
fucking music out. And then they edit.

1403
01:17:45,020 --> 01:17:47,780
There's nothing to see here.
That's the thing about it goes.

1404
01:17:47,781 --> 01:17:50,360
There's nothing to see here
to fucking look all day.

1405
01:17:50,361 --> 01:17:53,660
No one's the most you have
is like some weird image,

1406
01:17:53,690 --> 01:17:58,460
you know whispery image and again, it's
only interesting because it's unknown.

1407
01:17:58,490 --> 01:18:02,360
It's only interesting because people
think there might be ghost might be real

1408
01:18:02,361 --> 01:18:05,160
into secret thing.
It might be real crazy.

1409
01:18:05,770 --> 01:18:10,750
It all depends on
what you define as a ghost.

1410
01:18:10,751 --> 01:18:13,830
You know, something that isn't in this
plane or whatever. But you know when you,

1411
01:18:13,831 --> 01:18:15,190
you talk science,

1412
01:18:15,580 --> 01:18:19,210
the smartest motherfuckers that have
ever lived with a Nazi scientists,

1413
01:18:19,211 --> 01:18:23,020
they are invented missiles that
were so far ahead of everyone else.

1414
01:18:23,021 --> 01:18:27,550
Tech in science and technology. Those
was good. You know what I'm saying?

1415
01:18:27,580 --> 01:18:31,660
Like when they went down, Russians
raced in a, took half their scientists.

1416
01:18:31,661 --> 01:18:33,100
The Americans took the other scientists.

1417
01:18:33,330 --> 01:18:34,590
Yeah.
A lot of people don't even know that.

1418
01:18:34,591 --> 01:18:36,790
Our space program is based
entirely on Nazi sign.

1419
01:18:36,810 --> 01:18:40,170
Never the smartest motherfucker,
Wernher von Braun, and they were

1420
01:18:40,310 --> 01:18:42,530
down this,
I mean,

1421
01:18:43,460 --> 01:18:46,920
to ancient aliens. I don't
know. According to age,

1422
01:18:47,430 --> 01:18:50,190
that is maybe the worst
reference you could ever say.

1423
01:18:50,350 --> 01:18:55,140
It's like according to Wikipedia,
you are a fucking skull and bones.

1424
01:18:55,520 --> 01:18:59,370
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm very excited about
it. No, I am me nice. He's a nice guy.

1425
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:04,080
I liked the guy because it's, it's,
it's a show. It's an entertainment.

1426
01:19:04,081 --> 01:19:07,620
Show me talks about Atlantis maybe being
a spaceship that flew off in this guy.

1427
01:19:07,621 --> 01:19:09,750
Of course.
Maybe it's a rabbit in an eight,

1428
01:19:09,751 --> 01:19:13,770
a giant magical carrot and that created
the end of the Atlantic and empire. Yes,

1429
01:19:13,771 --> 01:19:15,630
I did. It was fascinating.
It was fascinating.

1430
01:19:15,631 --> 01:19:19,440
The actual facts of what the Nazis were
into and a lot of what they are into is

1431
01:19:19,441 --> 01:19:23,630
like ancient Hindu scriptures, like the
vimanas. They studied all these, you know,

1432
01:19:23,700 --> 01:19:28,700
vimanas were like these flying things
in ancient Hindu scriptures that from

1433
01:19:28,831 --> 01:19:29,970
thousands and thousand years ago,

1434
01:19:29,971 --> 01:19:32,910
these flying ships that people have
always tried to interpret like,

1435
01:19:32,911 --> 01:19:35,890
what the fuck did they mean by
this? You know, and the, the,

1436
01:19:35,891 --> 01:19:38,520
the Nazi scientists were
fascinated by all that stuff.

1437
01:19:38,521 --> 01:19:41,730
They were very much into the cult
and very much into a, you know,

1438
01:19:41,790 --> 01:19:43,380
the idea of ancient knowledge.

1439
01:19:43,590 --> 01:19:47,610
And you could throw that aside and say
they were silly if it wasn't for the

1440
01:19:47,611 --> 01:19:52,410
incredible technological capabilities
that they had back then. BMW,

1441
01:19:52,470 --> 01:19:56,520
that was, those were, they made engines
for Nazis. Man. I mean Volkswagen,

1442
01:19:56,610 --> 01:19:59,070
that's the car for the people, you
know, there was, there was so much,

1443
01:19:59,100 --> 01:20:00,900
they made incredible rockets there.

1444
01:20:00,901 --> 01:20:05,040
Rocketry was so far ahead of anything
and the rest of the world they were,

1445
01:20:05,041 --> 01:20:07,980
they were the innovators when it
comes to the, the field of, of

1446
01:20:07,980 --> 01:20:11,060
rocketry and space travel,
pop Warner, von Braun. Yeah.

1447
01:20:11,730 --> 01:20:16,730
Warner von Braun and Hermann Oberth
are both quoted as saying all that

1448
01:20:17,281 --> 01:20:20,850
technology came from help from beans,
from another solar system.

1449
01:20:21,060 --> 01:20:24,750
It never channeling, never
channeling information. Yeah.

1450
01:20:24,840 --> 01:20:29,040
To build UFL is they built four different
models of UFS and they're saying they

1451
01:20:29,041 --> 01:20:34,041
were getting the information antigravity
information by the virtual society,

1452
01:20:34,321 --> 01:20:38,010
which Hitler was a part of and they were
running the Nazis, the rural society.

1453
01:20:38,011 --> 01:20:42,720
And it was all based on channeling from
another solar system that there were

1454
01:20:42,750 --> 01:20:45,510
this, this chick, I forget
her name, Maria. Oh,

1455
01:20:45,511 --> 01:20:50,511
stitch was the head out of medium and
she was channeling ancient Sumerian tax.

1456
01:20:51,450 --> 01:20:53,900
And then they bring in a, uh,
a dude who can transcribe it.

1457
01:20:53,901 --> 01:20:54,990
She had no idea what she was writing.

1458
01:20:54,991 --> 01:20:58,420
It was an ancient Sumerian text and
there's instructions on how to build Ufo.

1459
01:20:58,710 --> 01:21:00,120
They built four of them.

1460
01:21:01,200 --> 01:21:04,440
It's on record of Honeboo one
Honolulu to Honolulu three.

1461
01:21:04,890 --> 01:21:09,590
They built you elbows and they're saying
they build space ships, they build Ufo.

1462
01:21:10,060 --> 01:21:14,460
Well, you have photos are unidentified.
Yeah, well yeah, they belt antigravity.

1463
01:21:14,580 --> 01:21:17,820
So a lot of the,
the sightings in the forties and fifties,

1464
01:21:17,821 --> 01:21:20,580
and probably even to today are all based,
or not all,

1465
01:21:20,581 --> 01:21:23,790
but I'm sure a lot of
them were German Ufo.

1466
01:21:24,110 --> 01:21:28,230
When they say that they build something
that's antigravity that can't really be

1467
01:21:28,231 --> 01:21:31,180
proven because we can't do
antigravity today. Right.

1468
01:21:31,181 --> 01:21:32,750
So because we can't do antigravity,

1469
01:21:32,760 --> 01:21:36,840
we don't have a working model that they
actually had that we could fly around in.

1470
01:21:37,200 --> 01:21:38,610
A lot of that is speculation,

1471
01:21:38,850 --> 01:21:42,990
but we do know that they were coming up
with some weird shaped aircraft. I mean,

1472
01:21:42,991 --> 01:21:47,220
some photos of them with these
saucer looking a Nazi ships,

1473
01:21:47,250 --> 01:21:51,080
like actual undisputable photos.
They didn't fly. Who knows?

1474
01:21:52,440 --> 01:21:53,910
Who knows if the flu or not?
I don't know.

1475
01:21:53,911 --> 01:21:58,911
Do you know that they didn't find it
did fly me back then that for models?

1476
01:21:59,610 --> 01:22:01,540
Well they had planes,
man. I mean, they could,

1477
01:22:01,740 --> 01:22:05,760
they could make one of those fucking
things flying the jet engine, you know,

1478
01:22:05,761 --> 01:22:10,740
I don't know if it would, uh,
obviously it would be any good. I mean,

1479
01:22:10,850 --> 01:22:12,630
it might suck.
Maybe that's why they stopped using it.

1480
01:22:12,750 --> 01:22:16,110
There's a funny picture online of a
Adolf Hitler with, uh, with an alien.

1481
01:22:16,230 --> 01:22:18,640
I think he's just in the center
then. Adolf Hitler. Dude,

1482
01:22:18,641 --> 01:22:21,720
don't even say shit like that
on my podcast pitch. This don't,

1483
01:22:21,721 --> 01:22:24,750
you didn't pay attention to what's
happened to fucking Tracy Morgan.

1484
01:22:24,890 --> 01:22:27,840
Just talking about Charlie Chaplin.
There's a, there's all these weird photos.

1485
01:22:27,841 --> 01:22:30,390
Are these fucking these things
at the Nazis built? Man,

1486
01:22:30,660 --> 01:22:33,000
I wouldn't know how many of these photos
are hoaxes and how many of them are

1487
01:22:33,001 --> 01:22:36,610
legit, but it's a pretty
fascinating man. It's,

1488
01:22:36,780 --> 01:22:41,780
to me the most fascinating part is
that they were using mediums to channel

1489
01:22:42,780 --> 01:22:45,370
aliens from another rep and how
do we know that? That's true.

1490
01:22:45,371 --> 01:22:50,190
Is that an ancient aliens then? It
was probably the u s government. Yes.

1491
01:22:50,780 --> 01:22:54,330
What are you doing? What am I looking for?
The, what's the size of royal society?

1492
01:22:54,331 --> 01:22:57,360
Spell that. R. I. L so sorry.

1493
01:22:57,660 --> 01:23:00,510
Yeah, it makes me wonder if
maybe they were just really
dumb. Yeah. He's like, yeah,

1494
01:23:00,511 --> 01:23:01,470
we're talking to aliens and,

1495
01:23:01,480 --> 01:23:04,230
but they were really talking
to our government and we're
like, oh yeah. Well, yeah.

1496
01:23:04,260 --> 01:23:06,030
Well, you know, you can poo

1497
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:08,530
poo all you want.
The idea of secret societies,

1498
01:23:08,531 --> 01:23:12,850
but the bottom line is almost every single
fucking president has been a part of

1499
01:23:12,851 --> 01:23:16,220
one of those fucking things in high
school or in college. Rabbit's gone.

1500
01:23:16,390 --> 01:23:20,380
Bullshit is so disturbing that these
people get together in college and decided

1501
01:23:20,381 --> 01:23:22,840
to run shit based on, you know, this,

1502
01:23:22,870 --> 01:23:24,790
this bond that they make
when they're in college.

1503
01:23:24,791 --> 01:23:28,630
But it completely makes sense if you pay
attention to how people operate, man.

1504
01:23:28,870 --> 01:23:30,280
Especially if you could,
I mean,

1505
01:23:30,281 --> 01:23:33,910
the best way to keep something secret
really keeps something secret is to have a

1506
01:23:33,911 --> 01:23:38,560
bunch of people who belong
to some exclusive group
and they won't rat anything

1507
01:23:38,561 --> 01:23:41,000
out. You know, it's like, like, like a,

1508
01:23:41,001 --> 01:23:43,630
a group of buddies who will talk
about man law. Like, you know,

1509
01:23:43,780 --> 01:23:46,180
you don't say shit about
nothing, nothing to, you know,

1510
01:23:46,181 --> 01:23:49,990
what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas. I
mean that's, this is that on a huge level,

1511
01:23:50,200 --> 01:23:52,600
you know, skull and bones is
basically what happens in Vegas,

1512
01:23:52,601 --> 01:23:57,310
stays in Vegas on the biggest level
possible, raping the world, causing wars,

1513
01:23:57,311 --> 01:24:00,760
doing all this crazy shit and doing it
under this premise of we're all a part of

1514
01:24:00,761 --> 01:24:03,970
this group that agrees to be
running the world in secret.

1515
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:07,960
What happens in Iraq stays in Iraq
and they put in, they're asking,

1516
01:24:08,350 --> 01:24:11,260
they're asking each other to join
this thing and so to join it,

1517
01:24:11,261 --> 01:24:14,260
they make them do some really
embarrassing shit. Like, you know,

1518
01:24:14,290 --> 01:24:18,490
you hear different stories from Soc Cox
to let guys piss in their mouth or to

1519
01:24:18,510 --> 01:24:20,800
all sorts of weird shit and
they get it all on film.

1520
01:24:20,980 --> 01:24:23,620
And this is how you become a
member in this, this group.

1521
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:26,260
Everyone has to do these things,
dress up like a diaper,

1522
01:24:26,261 --> 01:24:30,010
let dude shit in your hair like that.
Just the most fucked up thing possible.

1523
01:24:30,011 --> 01:24:33,940
And they film it so that they always
have you. Yeah, but who the fuck knows?

1524
01:24:33,941 --> 01:24:34,774
That sounds like,

1525
01:24:34,870 --> 01:24:37,900
that sounds like some shit that you're
saying in your mom's basement and there's

1526
01:24:37,901 --> 01:24:40,870
like wood paneling on the wall and
you're doing bong rips like dude.

1527
01:24:40,990 --> 01:24:44,740
And then they totally make you eat shit.
Really? Yeah, man. So my cousin said,

1528
01:24:44,960 --> 01:24:48,340
my cousin said that was real.
Eddie likes super eight.

1529
01:24:49,740 --> 01:24:53,440
It was all right. Yeah. That's how
I felt too. People got mad at me.

1530
01:24:53,441 --> 01:24:56,500
We talked about last week I gave
some spoilers away. I would see it.

1531
01:24:56,560 --> 01:24:58,960
I'd see it again. I mean if I
didn't know any better, if I,

1532
01:24:58,961 --> 01:25:02,080
if I didn't know that the plot, I
would go see it. It's a fun ride.

1533
01:25:02,140 --> 01:25:05,920
The fat kid is a great actor of
all those kids are pretty amazing.

1534
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:09,370
They were good. Elliot to his Gig,
they're probably going to be spectacular.

1535
01:25:09,371 --> 01:25:12,760
Fuckups later in their life bank on them.
They're probably going to be amazing.

1536
01:25:12,790 --> 01:25:15,410
They're probably going to be Macaulay
Culkin, ask it. Just kind of,

1537
01:25:15,460 --> 01:25:19,690
they're all going to be on Dr drew show.
Have you watched the new episodes?

1538
01:25:19,870 --> 01:25:24,670
Joey Diaz swears it's the best of
celebrity rehabs I noticed. I don't know.

1539
01:25:24,671 --> 01:25:27,100
I looked at my DVR the other day. There
was a couple of them, so I was like,

1540
01:25:27,101 --> 01:25:31,540
oh Jesus, here we go again.
Lindsay Lohan, his dad's on it,

1541
01:25:32,110 --> 01:25:34,840
and Amy Fisher. Is He really? Amy Fisher,

1542
01:25:34,841 --> 01:25:38,950
the WHO got famous by shooting someone.
She's on it. She's a celebrity.

1543
01:25:39,100 --> 01:25:43,180
She shot married Joe Butter Fuko in the
fucking face and that made her celebrity.

1544
01:25:43,900 --> 01:25:46,300
That's hilarious. What kind of a
weird world we live in and man,

1545
01:25:46,450 --> 01:25:51,450
where every fucking show is real
housewives and teen moms and mob wives and

1546
01:25:51,750 --> 01:25:56,740
auto. Fuck are we doing man, you want to
see real shit. That's not even real shit.

1547
01:25:56,880 --> 01:26:00,970
We want to size UFC and all reality shows.
That's like real shit.

1548
01:26:00,971 --> 01:26:03,070
We don't want to see fighting
movies but out a fighting movie.

1549
01:26:03,080 --> 01:26:04,190
Most of those reality

1550
01:26:04,190 --> 01:26:07,310
shows are bullshit. You know that
as much. But we think it's real.

1551
01:26:07,520 --> 01:26:09,680
Most people think it's real.
You know what I think it is?

1552
01:26:09,860 --> 01:26:13,640
I think our lives are becoming more and
more complex and people are more and

1553
01:26:13,641 --> 01:26:17,120
more stressful and they have more and
more real problems and they want to be

1554
01:26:17,121 --> 01:26:20,390
distracted with a problem that they could
focus on that they have absolutely no

1555
01:26:20,391 --> 01:26:21,224
stake in.

1556
01:26:21,410 --> 01:26:24,290
So they could watch people with their
drama and getting mad at each other and

1557
01:26:24,291 --> 01:26:28,370
crazy and screaming and this girl was
fucking his wife and he's going fucking

1558
01:26:28,371 --> 01:26:30,740
crazy and they're going bankrupt.
But meanwhile,

1559
01:26:30,741 --> 01:26:32,510
you personally have zero stake in it,

1560
01:26:32,810 --> 01:26:36,800
so you can sit there and watch it and
get totally caught up in it and you know

1561
01:26:36,830 --> 01:26:40,940
and you don't. Your life
doesn't fall apart. It's like
Cathartic. Yeah, makes sense.

1562
01:26:41,030 --> 01:26:44,450
Totally makes sense, right? Yup. That's
what I think is going now. This is,

1563
01:26:44,540 --> 01:26:46,760
if you want real proof that
there's an apocalypse coming down,

1564
01:26:46,790 --> 01:26:51,080
it's what the fuck is on TV. That's the
real proof. The real proof is mob wives.

1565
01:26:51,260 --> 01:26:55,700
The real proof is real housewives of New
Jersey. You Watch these morons living,

1566
01:26:55,701 --> 01:26:59,360
they're retarded life.
They're non introspective,

1567
01:27:00,060 --> 01:27:01,400
no common sense.

1568
01:27:01,401 --> 01:27:06,401
Not Thinking Ego testicle under
the microscope and can't handle it.

1569
01:27:06,560 --> 01:27:08,870
The spotlight's on them.
They don't know what the fuck to do.

1570
01:27:08,871 --> 01:27:12,770
They're acting crazy and here their
nonsense talking. That's, that's the,

1571
01:27:12,950 --> 01:27:16,580
that's the sign. That's a sign. It's all
going down. That's the sign. Eddie Bravo.

1572
01:27:16,700 --> 01:27:17,730
You know what?
We should do Joey's shit.

1573
01:27:17,770 --> 01:27:21,080
We should try to get tickets to that
comic continents coming out. Fuck yeah.

1574
01:27:21,200 --> 01:27:24,180
I would love to go down there and
start some shit. We should speak.

1575
01:27:24,580 --> 01:27:28,400
Speak at comic con about podcasts,
like we're experts, we should speak.

1576
01:27:28,400 --> 01:27:32,060
Somebody asked me to speak
at the zeitgeists movement.
This is like guys thing.

1577
01:27:32,090 --> 01:27:36,620
Uh, September 11th, 2011. There's the
you want to grow, they want to go that,

1578
01:27:36,860 --> 01:27:40,550
I don't know, it's an la, there's a series
of them. It's like guys, the media event,

1579
01:27:40,580 --> 01:27:44,860
they asked me to speak in it, which I'm
down. But the problem is meant with,

1580
01:27:44,861 --> 01:27:49,250
with all of these things, whenever you
claim that you fucking got the answers.

1581
01:27:49,460 --> 01:27:51,220
All right.
Whether it's just like guys throw,

1582
01:27:51,221 --> 01:27:52,970
whether it's Scientology or whether it's,

1583
01:27:53,480 --> 01:27:56,420
I don't want to equate zeitgeisty
Scientology, but it's too late already.

1584
01:27:56,421 --> 01:28:01,100
Did they? They don't have the
answers, man. And everybody's
saying, you know, like,

1585
01:28:01,160 --> 01:28:03,350
like if you, if you look at a, there's a,

1586
01:28:03,351 --> 01:28:06,800
there's a website called
zeitgeists debunked and you know,

1587
01:28:06,801 --> 01:28:10,760
there's a lot of shit that they got wrong,
man. Just straight wrong. Of course.

1588
01:28:10,790 --> 01:28:14,900
When it comes to, even when it comes to
the way they were backing up the, um, the,

1589
01:28:14,901 --> 01:28:19,730
uh, the, the, uh, the, the
history of, um, of, of religion.

1590
01:28:19,760 --> 01:28:23,120
They got all these, these things wrong
with Mithra and all that and it's,

1591
01:28:23,121 --> 01:28:25,040
it's been corrected on all
these different websites,

1592
01:28:25,041 --> 01:28:26,510
all the things that they
got incorrect about,

1593
01:28:26,630 --> 01:28:30,170
but they're so confident in these points
of view that they can put these points

1594
01:28:30,171 --> 01:28:34,650
of view out. No, no, no, no, not
at all. No. I was like, can I see,

1595
01:28:34,651 --> 01:28:36,470
it's pretty interesting. There's
a lot of this, like I said,

1596
01:28:36,471 --> 01:28:39,110
I've been nine one one, right.
It's a lot of, it's nine one,

1597
01:28:39,111 --> 01:28:41,500
one in the area and also I have
a problem with it where there's,

1598
01:28:41,510 --> 01:28:44,450
there's things when they talk about
the towers and how the towers fell.

1599
01:28:44,600 --> 01:28:48,100
I just farther this time, this time was,
was me. That was me. If you smell as far,

1600
01:28:49,250 --> 01:28:53,690
don't run away, Brian. Don't be
scared. Anyway, the, uh, you're a,

1601
01:28:53,691 --> 01:28:56,960
you're using this as an excuse to
get up. Did you fart? No, I did.

1602
01:28:57,020 --> 01:28:59,450
I actually just had to go to the bathroom
and they said it wasn't even bad,

1603
01:29:00,050 --> 01:29:02,970
but I'm just, um, in so many
didn't own up for the last one.

1604
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:06,060
I felt like I should only have it a
smart man. Okay, man. Maybe it was Brian.

1605
01:29:06,061 --> 01:29:09,240
Maybe it was thing my cat's in
here somewhere. And by the way,

1606
01:29:09,241 --> 01:29:11,550
she took a nasty shit and that
litter box in the bathroom,

1607
01:29:11,790 --> 01:29:13,700
it might be that walk out here.

1608
01:29:14,430 --> 01:29:18,570
What percentage is explosive and which
percentage of solid loaves? Well,

1609
01:29:18,571 --> 01:29:21,630
I've been eating a lot of lettuce lately
and I've also been drinking this new

1610
01:29:21,631 --> 01:29:26,460
thing. Uh, this, this, um, this
vegetable drink. It's amazing,
man. I got this Vitamix,

1611
01:29:26,550 --> 01:29:30,780
you know Kevin James loss 80 fucking
pounds, right? Kevin look great dude.

1612
01:29:30,781 --> 01:29:34,920
His face skinny, he looks so healthy.
It looks like vibrant. It's crazy.

1613
01:29:35,160 --> 01:29:38,940
And he got on Chubby at all while he's
still got a gut. He still, he look dude,

1614
01:29:38,941 --> 01:29:41,580
he was 300 fucking pounds.
He's got extra skin, you know,

1615
01:29:41,581 --> 01:29:45,840
but he's in way better shape then.
Awesome. Almost since I met him,

1616
01:29:46,170 --> 01:29:49,500
I met him in 91,
maybe somewhere around then.

1617
01:29:49,740 --> 01:29:53,620
And this is about as healthy as I've
ever seen him as far as like his diet and

1618
01:29:53,621 --> 01:29:57,180
what's what he's doing. And he got this
Vitamix thing and he swears by it, man.

1619
01:29:57,181 --> 01:30:00,860
He's like, he's like, he
told me about this book, some
woman wrote this book on on,

1620
01:30:00,870 --> 01:30:03,300
you know, how are you supposed to eat
vegetables? And that, the problem is,

1621
01:30:03,301 --> 01:30:04,021
you know,
your,

1622
01:30:04,021 --> 01:30:07,500
your body spent so much time digesting
food and breaking food down that it

1623
01:30:07,501 --> 01:30:11,070
causes a lot, uses up a lot of
energy. So she has this, um,

1624
01:30:11,250 --> 01:30:15,150
she tells you to take this blender and
you blend all your vegetables together.

1625
01:30:15,150 --> 01:30:20,150
So I blend like Kale and I blend cucumbers
and I blend like a pear and in some,

1626
01:30:20,960 --> 01:30:24,090
some, some, um, some
ginger and some celery,

1627
01:30:24,091 --> 01:30:28,170
a bunch of shit together into this
drink that looks like the hulks loads.

1628
01:30:28,410 --> 01:30:31,350
That's what it looks like,
just as green crazy drink.

1629
01:30:31,530 --> 01:30:34,230
And I drink this shit and first of all,
my shit,

1630
01:30:34,231 --> 01:30:38,880
full clothes out of me like a
river. No, nicely, just nicely.

1631
01:30:38,881 --> 01:30:40,440
Just slides out like,

1632
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:45,150
like if you were logging on a river
and it was a nice strong current to the

1633
01:30:45,151 --> 01:30:48,320
river and you unloaded
a whole truckload of,

1634
01:30:48,321 --> 01:30:52,460
of logs into this river to take them
down hill. And then he just went, ah,

1635
01:30:52,500 --> 01:30:55,550
just traveled down hill. That's what
it's like when I take a shit. My,

1636
01:30:55,551 --> 01:30:59,100
my logs just traveled down hill.
Ah Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1637
01:30:59,350 --> 01:31:00,290
So it comes out nice.

1638
01:31:00,550 --> 01:31:02,510
You don't ever have explosive. No, no, no.

1639
01:31:03,160 --> 01:31:05,630
That's probably Mexican
for the 5% much time.

1640
01:31:05,740 --> 01:31:09,580
You know what that is 100% that what
that is, it's a food allergy. A,

1641
01:31:09,581 --> 01:31:11,500
you should get tested with food allergies,
cell test,

1642
01:31:11,501 --> 01:31:14,790
everything and give you a percentage up
and down that how allergic you are at

1643
01:31:14,800 --> 01:31:19,420
that rate of explosive shit. It's food
hours. You'll be surprised your body.

1644
01:31:19,480 --> 01:31:22,660
Cause it's after I eat. Yeah. Yeah.
It's probably most likely bread.

1645
01:31:22,690 --> 01:31:26,890
I bet you have a food allergy to bread
and it might not be like you can't eat

1646
01:31:26,891 --> 01:31:29,220
bread, but definitely be
talking to the microphone more.

1647
01:31:29,250 --> 01:31:33,310
So I think a lot of people
have a analogy to gluten. Jeff,

1648
01:31:33,400 --> 01:31:36,420
Jeff's wife has me. That's
exactly what it probably is. Yeah,

1649
01:31:36,421 --> 01:31:37,191
it's a real common one.

1650
01:31:37,191 --> 01:31:40,870
Apparently it's not that good for your
body to be eaten bread. Apparently bread,

1651
01:31:40,871 --> 01:31:43,930
even though it fills you up, you know,
bread, you know as great for poor people.

1652
01:31:43,931 --> 01:31:44,141
You know,

1653
01:31:44,141 --> 01:31:46,300
you take your wheat and you make your
bread and it fills your belly and it gives

1654
01:31:46,301 --> 01:31:48,850
you carbohydrates. Apparently you
body doesn't like breaking it down,

1655
01:31:49,030 --> 01:31:53,140
especially processed white
flour. Apparently that's
just just glue. You know?

1656
01:31:53,150 --> 01:31:56,140
It's just like funky glue like you're
supposed to eat. Like Ezekiel bread,

1657
01:31:56,290 --> 01:31:58,780
like Ezekiel bread is really good for you.
I love that shit.

1658
01:31:58,810 --> 01:32:00,010
I have zeal bread with peanut

1659
01:32:00,010 --> 01:32:02,650
butter in it. I don't even feel like
I'm doing anything bad. You know?

1660
01:32:02,651 --> 01:32:04,930
I don't feel like if I have a peanut
butter and Jelly Sandwich on whole wheat

1661
01:32:04,931 --> 01:32:08,170
bread, I'm like, how much sugar is in
this man? This is all sugar, you know?

1662
01:32:08,350 --> 01:32:12,220
But if I have like some a Zico bread
with some natural peanut butter,

1663
01:32:12,221 --> 01:32:15,250
I don't feel bad at all. It's
terrific for all the time. Great.

1664
01:32:15,750 --> 01:32:18,800
Can we have a moment of silence for
Fogo de Chao? I love that place. Oh,

1665
01:32:18,810 --> 01:32:22,090
what fun is silence. Why don't you
fucking go, there's one in Los Angeles.

1666
01:32:22,310 --> 01:32:24,760
I was going to say, I went there
two days ago. Did you guys,

1667
01:32:24,790 --> 01:32:26,460
we need to do another
desk squad trip there.

1668
01:32:26,560 --> 01:32:27,640
This is what we're going to do folks.

1669
01:32:27,641 --> 01:32:29,290
We're going to take a
trip to the salt and sea.

1670
01:32:29,500 --> 01:32:31,600
Eddie and I talked about
it as soon as he showed up.

1671
01:32:31,600 --> 01:32:34,780
I got a book here on the salt and sea
and I got to documentary sitting on my

1672
01:32:34,781 --> 01:32:36,550
desk because being the retard that I am,

1673
01:32:36,670 --> 01:32:41,580
whenever a subject comes up on the podcast
or that I get up said hip too, um, I,

1674
01:32:41,590 --> 01:32:45,340
I get fascinated by it and the salt and
sees the thing that I've been so I'm so

1675
01:32:45,341 --> 01:32:46,370
fascinated by it lately.

1676
01:32:46,371 --> 01:32:49,720
And apparently Eddie says that Sonny
Bono was the guy that was trying to save

1677
01:32:49,721 --> 01:32:52,840
the salt and sea trying to bring it back
and apparently it can be brought back.

1678
01:32:52,880 --> 01:32:55,690
Yeah, it could be according
to the documentary they,

1679
01:32:55,720 --> 01:32:57,700
which documentaries
this is it any of those?

1680
01:32:57,701 --> 01:33:00,850
This one plagues and pleasures of the
salt and seeing plagues and pleasures of

1681
01:33:00,851 --> 01:33:03,700
the salts. And isn't that a John
Waters documentary? I'm not sure,

1682
01:33:03,701 --> 01:33:07,840
but it's amazing. It is. Gotta see that
them pleasures on the salt and sea. Yeah,

1683
01:33:07,841 --> 01:33:12,460
I just received it because somebody
sent me hip to a, a video online.

1684
01:33:12,490 --> 01:33:16,570
They linked it to me on
Twitter and I tweet retweeted
it. Yeah, it quite open it.

1685
01:33:16,750 --> 01:33:19,580
It was a while back, maybe a
couple of weeks ago. And uh,

1686
01:33:19,760 --> 01:33:22,660
I watched this video online
about this ocean inside,

1687
01:33:22,930 --> 01:33:24,460
I mean almost like an ocean that's huge.

1688
01:33:24,880 --> 01:33:29,320
Manmade Lake inside of California's
coast. And I was like, what the fuck?

1689
01:33:29,321 --> 01:33:30,310
This is nuts,
man.

1690
01:33:30,430 --> 01:33:34,150
And then it talks about how
toxic it became because of
the runoff from all these

1691
01:33:34,151 --> 01:33:36,850
different farms and that
it got saltier and saltier.

1692
01:33:36,851 --> 01:33:39,850
The point where like a lot of the
animals of the fish just fucking died.

1693
01:33:39,851 --> 01:33:43,720
And these people still live there
and in the city got flooded, flooded.

1694
01:33:43,770 --> 01:33:46,690
That's what fucked everything. Okay.
And when you see it, man, you're like,

1695
01:33:46,691 --> 01:33:49,630
what the fuck?
It looks like like some crazy,

1696
01:33:49,660 --> 01:33:52,020
it looks like some Mad Max shit
like we were talking about.

1697
01:33:52,170 --> 01:33:54,520
It looks like Armageddon.
Yeah,

1698
01:33:54,521 --> 01:33:57,610
so we're going to do a desk
squad photo shoot from out there.

1699
01:33:57,640 --> 01:34:01,570
That's what we do live there. Yeah.
There's 400 people that live there.

1700
01:34:01,600 --> 01:34:03,370
That's incredible. It's cheapest. Fuck.

1701
01:34:03,430 --> 01:34:08,290
You can buy a house for
our property for like man,

1702
01:34:08,410 --> 01:34:11,700
it's, it's a, it was a three
it was probably $3,000 a month.

1703
01:34:11,790 --> 01:34:15,700
You can buy a lot time. Does it take to
drive out there? It takes about two hours.

1704
01:34:15,730 --> 01:34:19,090
We should build a death squad
studio at the salt and sea.

1705
01:34:19,390 --> 01:34:22,210
Just do once a month salt and see shows.

1706
01:34:22,270 --> 01:34:25,120
If I buy a house for 300 or 3000 bucks,

1707
01:34:25,270 --> 01:34:29,170
you could probably buy 300 might be 300
but I think it's 3000 some of the people

1708
01:34:29,171 --> 01:34:30,850
that they showed that live there,
it's seriously,

1709
01:34:30,880 --> 01:34:32,920
they're like crazy homeless
people like meth heads.

1710
01:34:33,160 --> 01:34:35,950
Well that's okay as long as we
don't leave any equipment behind.

1711
01:34:36,130 --> 01:34:38,260
But what if we like have
a place and we set it up,

1712
01:34:38,350 --> 01:34:40,810
we get some couches in there and shit,
get an internet connection,

1713
01:34:40,960 --> 01:34:44,200
bring our laptops so we don't
really have to have equipment there.

1714
01:34:44,470 --> 01:34:48,820
Bring our laptops and our mixer set
that shit up and do like a weekly or a

1715
01:34:48,821 --> 01:34:53,420
monthly show from the salt
and sea. It's scary. Salty.

1716
01:34:53,920 --> 01:34:58,010
I mean there was a thriving
many French Riviera right in

1717
01:34:58,010 --> 01:35:00,710
California, two hours away. Jack the,

1718
01:35:00,750 --> 01:35:03,840
I think it's the biggest manmade
lake in the country. Yeah.

1719
01:35:03,950 --> 01:35:06,290
And it's the biggest body
of water in California.

1720
01:35:06,291 --> 01:35:08,420
It was thriving in the 50s all the,

1721
01:35:08,530 --> 01:35:12,230
they were building all these condos and
houses. People were moving out there.

1722
01:35:12,290 --> 01:35:16,040
It was amazing. They're like fuck palm
springs, you ain't got no Goddamn Lake.

1723
01:35:16,550 --> 01:35:19,640
They were going and salt and sea
and then they had a big flood.

1724
01:35:19,940 --> 01:35:23,050
Like the levees broke and all this
shit cause was all manmade, flooded,

1725
01:35:23,060 --> 01:35:24,950
everything out.
People freaked out.

1726
01:35:25,280 --> 01:35:28,550
And there's still people today that are
living there that were there waiting for

1727
01:35:28,551 --> 01:35:31,790
it to come back. They were back. They
all, they remember the good old days. Wow.

1728
01:35:31,850 --> 01:35:35,270
And it's dark. It's like, uh, it's like,

1729
01:35:36,560 --> 01:35:40,070
um, it's really is a ghost town.
It reminds me of like California.

1730
01:35:40,071 --> 01:35:40,904
Remember Brad right

1731
01:35:40,910 --> 01:35:45,400
head and uh,
and David Duchovny.

1732
01:35:45,410 --> 01:35:49,730
Remember the whole, yeah. Cal
California ghost towns like this.

1733
01:35:49,750 --> 01:35:53,840
I'll do you've juke driven from California
to Vegas before you've done that,

1734
01:35:53,841 --> 01:35:55,640
right?
Did you go with me?

1735
01:35:55,770 --> 01:35:59,870
We drove and you and me and Dimitri and
we stopped off in one of those little

1736
01:35:59,871 --> 01:36:02,180
ghost towns where they
had like a fake gun fight.

1737
01:36:02,960 --> 01:36:05,460
Do you remember that Shit that was
happening? It wasn't, you know, it was,

1738
01:36:05,720 --> 01:36:06,530
it was me,
Dimitri.

1739
01:36:06,530 --> 01:36:10,820
Then we were headed to Vegas to see the
k one that we went to one with a couple

1740
01:36:10,821 --> 01:36:13,460
of times. We did a case that we
did a couple of k one trips. Yeah.

1741
01:36:13,520 --> 01:36:17,090
Well back then there was no UFC in
Vegas is so old school were going,

1742
01:36:17,210 --> 01:36:20,660
there was no UFC in Vegas. So Eddie
and I would want to go see fights.

1743
01:36:20,720 --> 01:36:22,580
We'd have to go see k one Vegas.

1744
01:36:22,610 --> 01:36:27,050
Scott Coker used to promote k one and
Vegas and it's got hardly no one there.

1745
01:36:27,051 --> 01:36:29,830
It's tiny little ballroom.
The Bellagio. A ballroom.

1746
01:36:30,230 --> 01:36:34,040
It was as big as are tough enough
is, yeah, just like that. Exactly.

1747
01:36:34,070 --> 01:36:35,750
We'll tell people don't know
what tough enough. It's tough.

1748
01:36:35,751 --> 01:36:39,980
And I was a local amateur show in Vegas
and we would go down there and there'd

1749
01:36:39,981 --> 01:36:43,670
be, you know, a few hundred people and
you'd get to see fucking Peter Arts,

1750
01:36:43,850 --> 01:36:47,990
Peter Arts, fos, Stefan Leco, you know
like high level top of the food chain.

1751
01:36:47,991 --> 01:36:50,900
K One guys. We're going at it, man.
It was some great fucking fights.

1752
01:36:51,350 --> 01:36:53,990
The K K one in Vegas was awesome.
They should bring that back.

1753
01:36:53,991 --> 01:36:56,690
I tried to talk to Dana about
that. I tried to take, dude, man,

1754
01:36:56,720 --> 01:36:59,600
maybe you should fucking get
involved in k one k one in.

1755
01:36:59,750 --> 01:37:02,420
I'm telling you to think about what's
the most exciting aspect of the UFC.

1756
01:37:02,510 --> 01:37:06,140
It's striking, right? You get the
best strikers in the world. Look,

1757
01:37:06,141 --> 01:37:07,700
I love watching Abu Dhabi.

1758
01:37:07,790 --> 01:37:12,260
I love watching Marcello Garcia
and and Pavel Popovich go after it.

1759
01:37:12,350 --> 01:37:16,670
I love watching Chaco Ray and Hodgett
Gracie go after it in in Abu Dhabi because

1760
01:37:16,671 --> 01:37:18,620
they're the elite of the elite grapplers.

1761
01:37:18,890 --> 01:37:22,400
I also like watching elite of
the elite strikers, you know,

1762
01:37:22,430 --> 01:37:25,240
in just straight up striking.
There's a lot of guys,

1763
01:37:25,260 --> 01:37:29,360
you don't get to see their full striking
skills in the UFC because they're

1764
01:37:29,361 --> 01:37:30,800
always worried about getting taken down.

1765
01:37:30,801 --> 01:37:33,140
They're always worried about getting
submitted. They're always worrying about,

1766
01:37:33,320 --> 01:37:34,430
you know,
dealing with certain things.

1767
01:37:34,431 --> 01:37:37,400
So it's hard for them to relax
and just get into the striking.

1768
01:37:37,550 --> 01:37:40,460
But if you watch like that k one max,
you ever watched that Shit Dude?

1769
01:37:40,490 --> 01:37:44,390
I'll be honest with you man. I try
to watch it. It's hard to watch it.

1770
01:37:44,450 --> 01:37:47,420
Is it really? Yeah. I'm not
that into it, man. I tried to,

1771
01:37:47,450 --> 01:37:49,340
maybe it's because you don't
have a striking background man.

1772
01:37:49,341 --> 01:37:51,590
Maybe that's what it is to
me. It's exciting. It's fuck.

1773
01:37:51,620 --> 01:37:53,710
That's all I watch when I watch a fights,

1774
01:37:53,720 --> 01:37:56,070
when I have the garage and I'll have
the set up in the garage. When I work

1775
01:37:56,070 --> 01:37:59,850
out all, I watched the k one Max I saw.
It's hard for me. [inaudible] fights.

1776
01:37:59,851 --> 01:38:03,120
I watched up crazy motherfucker.
Those fights are wild dude.

1777
01:38:03,570 --> 01:38:06,570
All that fucking just
straight stand up man.

1778
01:38:06,750 --> 01:38:10,530
When their leg kicking the shit out of
each other and flying knees and Tude you

1779
01:38:10,531 --> 01:38:13,260
can, you can't wash that. That
doesn't just an extension. I want to,

1780
01:38:13,261 --> 01:38:16,710
I want to like it, but it's boring as
hell. Wow. That's so weird. I want it.

1781
01:38:17,010 --> 01:38:19,470
It's gotta be, because that's not your
background because it's like, look,

1782
01:38:19,471 --> 01:38:22,050
I like watching pool.
I watched professional pool.

1783
01:38:22,051 --> 01:38:24,300
I've got hours of pool on my laptop.

1784
01:38:24,810 --> 01:38:29,190
I got like maybe 10 15 hours of pool
matches on my laptop at any given time.

1785
01:38:29,280 --> 01:38:31,590
So if I'm ever in an airport by myself,
Ooh,

1786
01:38:31,591 --> 01:38:34,590
I'll watch Mika eminent play F and Reyes
and I'll sit there and watch a pool

1787
01:38:34,591 --> 01:38:37,950
match that I already know that the,
the result. Got It. You got to be God

1788
01:38:40,400 --> 01:38:45,210
that wants it happily. If I'm gonna
watch striking, it's gotta. It's gotta.

1789
01:38:45,240 --> 01:38:48,390
There's gotta be a threat of the fight
going to the ground. I mean, really,

1790
01:38:48,780 --> 01:38:51,570
if I'm going to watch striking, it's
going to be check Congo and Pat Barry.

1791
01:38:51,630 --> 01:38:53,410
That's what I'm going to watch.
You know what I mean? Right.

1792
01:38:53,760 --> 01:38:56,490
There's a threat of going down there
on the floor. They didn't stop it.

1793
01:38:56,880 --> 01:39:00,120
I mean that fight could have been
stopped two different times easily.

1794
01:39:00,300 --> 01:39:03,300
Was that not the craziest end of
a fight you have ever seen? Ever?

1795
01:39:03,301 --> 01:39:06,040
This is the greatest comeback
in the history of combat sport.

1796
01:39:06,060 --> 01:39:09,060
I was watching it with a friend who
doesn't train. He'd done it. He didn't,

1797
01:39:09,061 --> 01:39:12,270
he was just telling me right before the
match. He goes, I hate it when people,

1798
01:39:12,390 --> 01:39:15,870
when a fighter hurts another fighter and
he goes down and then he jumps in his

1799
01:39:15,871 --> 01:39:17,790
guard and then strives to knock them out.

1800
01:39:17,790 --> 01:39:20,280
Why doesn't he just let them
get up and stand up? I go,

1801
01:39:20,281 --> 01:39:23,620
well a lot of times when a guy has hurt,
he throws hay makers and,

1802
01:39:23,630 --> 01:39:26,970
and if you catch one of those haymakers
while you think you have him hurt so

1803
01:39:26,971 --> 01:39:30,640
many fights can just turn it at the
blink of an eye. You want to get them,

1804
01:39:30,940 --> 01:39:32,970
you know your natural instinct is,
I got them hurt.

1805
01:39:33,450 --> 01:39:37,410
Let me put them in a spot where there's
no way he's gonna knock me out. Exactly.

1806
01:39:37,411 --> 01:39:39,690
So people just, that's a natural
instinct. I got you hurt.

1807
01:39:39,780 --> 01:39:43,800
Let me ground and pound you now and I
know for sure that there's even strikers

1808
01:39:43,801 --> 01:39:47,350
do that all the time, man. Yes,
exactly. They get on the wrong side.

1809
01:39:47,590 --> 01:39:50,580
They'll climate guys guard and we were
just talking about that and it happened.

1810
01:39:50,670 --> 01:39:51,503
Yeah.
Yeah.

1811
01:39:51,710 --> 01:39:54,300
Pat Barry would have just took him
down and pounded them on the ground.

1812
01:39:54,330 --> 01:39:58,560
That wouldn't have happened. Did you
ever see a Diego corrals and a Castillo?

1813
01:39:59,160 --> 01:40:02,520
No. You never saw that fight? It
was the boxing equivalent to that.

1814
01:40:02,550 --> 01:40:06,900
Jose Luis Castillo and Diego corrals,
dio corrals was fucked up.

1815
01:40:07,050 --> 01:40:10,620
He was getting dropped and battered
look at the fight was almost stop, Bang.

1816
01:40:10,740 --> 01:40:13,710
He connects and corrals goes out.
It was just like that.

1817
01:40:13,740 --> 01:40:16,530
I mean almost except there was
knocked down and they counted.

1818
01:40:16,740 --> 01:40:20,580
The excitement level of this was higher
because there was no counting, you know,

1819
01:40:20,581 --> 01:40:22,650
it was like the fight was
almost over at any second.

1820
01:40:22,770 --> 01:40:24,740
And literally Dan Merch Leon,

1821
01:40:24,741 --> 01:40:28,350
I got on top of them was going to
touch them and stopped the fight.

1822
01:40:28,410 --> 01:40:30,750
Like he had his hands over
them to stop the fight.

1823
01:40:30,960 --> 01:40:34,320
But then check Congo went for a single
and he changed his mind like a brilliant

1824
01:40:34,321 --> 01:40:35,400
decision and a lot of people said,

1825
01:40:35,430 --> 01:40:38,040
oh you should have stopped that fight
the fuck they should have stopped that

1826
01:40:38,041 --> 01:40:40,380
fight. Luke, who won? He won by knockout.

1827
01:40:40,470 --> 01:40:43,260
There's no way he should have stopped
his fight. He still wanted to fight.

1828
01:40:43,290 --> 01:40:46,230
He still could to fight.
He still could win and he did win.

1829
01:40:46,290 --> 01:40:48,660
So there's no way they should
have stopped that fight early on.

1830
01:40:48,720 --> 01:40:51,540
It was the absolute perfect stoppage.
You look,

1831
01:40:51,541 --> 01:40:54,160
you just know you had to
stop the once Pat Barry

1832
01:40:54,160 --> 01:40:57,880
was out cause Pat Barry was unconscious.
That's why I hate early stoppages.

1833
01:40:59,200 --> 01:41:00,740
Let them take an extra shot.
They,

1834
01:41:00,940 --> 01:41:04,610
they understand the danger they're in
there cause they're crazy freaks. I do.

1835
01:41:04,660 --> 01:41:05,520
I agree with you.

1836
01:41:05,610 --> 01:41:09,400
You don't like he seen a guy getting
blasted when he's already hurt because I

1837
01:41:09,401 --> 01:41:13,540
know what it does to them. I know the
physiological effect. Did you see, hey,

1838
01:41:13,630 --> 01:41:15,340
pull this up man.
Pull this up.

1839
01:41:15,430 --> 01:41:20,080
Roy Jones Jr can't say spectacular Po.
You're going to listen to this man.

1840
01:41:20,081 --> 01:41:23,350
This is traveling all over the Internet.
This is a really uncomfortable thing.

1841
01:41:23,351 --> 01:41:26,170
I saw it on my headphones. Yeah, you'll
see it. You're hearing in your headphones.

1842
01:41:26,500 --> 01:41:29,320
You don't have to see it because it's
just Roy Jones doing commentary and he

1843
01:41:29,321 --> 01:41:31,150
can't say the word spectacular.
You know,

1844
01:41:31,151 --> 01:41:33,800
he just got knocked the fuck
out by a Russian guy. Yeah.

1845
01:41:33,801 --> 01:41:37,090
Russian guy battered him and the 12th
round just like I thought it knocking you

1846
01:41:37,091 --> 01:41:42,040
out. You know it's all listen to play it,

1847
01:41:42,041 --> 01:41:44,580
play it. And this is, this
is going to freak you out. I
listened to Roy Jones. It's,

1848
01:41:44,620 --> 01:41:48,250
she's starting to slip. Listen
to this, we're going to it

1849
01:41:52,240 --> 01:41:53,073
this

1850
01:41:54,400 --> 01:41:57,290
region and it's country short Straw.

1851
01:41:57,890 --> 01:42:00,530
We sit and he's different slick tech

1852
01:42:03,840 --> 01:42:07,920
because he has typical here.
Wow, that's great. Wow.

1853
01:42:08,260 --> 01:42:11,080
Has he been at the beginning? If you see
it on video it's even more noticeable.

1854
01:42:11,081 --> 01:42:15,070
Like he really was. Yeah. And you know,
what's, what's dark about it all man,

1855
01:42:15,100 --> 01:42:19,450
is that Roy Jones was the guy who never
wanted to get hit or Jones was the guy

1856
01:42:19,451 --> 01:42:22,540
who never wanted to fight really
dangerous fighters because he was always

1857
01:42:22,541 --> 01:42:25,630
worried about brain damage cause he
was buddies with Gerald Mcclellan.

1858
01:42:25,960 --> 01:42:29,590
Gerald Mcclellan was one of the best
fucking middle weights and light

1859
01:42:29,591 --> 01:42:32,440
heavyweights ever.
John McClellan was a fucking animal,

1860
01:42:32,590 --> 01:42:37,420
but in his prime he got in a fight with
Nigel Benn and he cut a lot of weight

1861
01:42:37,421 --> 01:42:38,254
for that fight.

1862
01:42:38,260 --> 01:42:41,920
And during the fight the fight was ugly
and he blasted Nigel Benn in the first

1863
01:42:41,921 --> 01:42:42,101
round.

1864
01:42:42,101 --> 01:42:46,600
But Nigel Benn had Matt Hart and Nigel
Benn Hung in there and was there and the

1865
01:42:46,601 --> 01:42:49,750
second and third and they,
they fought like dogs, dude.

1866
01:42:49,751 --> 01:42:52,240
And they headbutted
and they clashed heads.

1867
01:42:52,240 --> 01:42:57,070
And at one time Nigel Benn and him
clashed heads after Nigel Benn was jacking

1868
01:42:57,071 --> 01:42:59,950
them with some punches. Like they were
just, they were just going after it, man.

1869
01:43:00,130 --> 01:43:02,500
And he,
Gerald Mcclellan took a knee,

1870
01:43:02,590 --> 01:43:05,470
he went down and took a knee and then
quit and then sat down was corn and there

1871
01:43:05,480 --> 01:43:08,230
was like, Whoa, what the fuck is
going on? And then he just collapsed.

1872
01:43:08,380 --> 01:43:10,060
Like he was obviously done like he was,

1873
01:43:10,270 --> 01:43:13,720
his brain was starting to bleed and he
had realized that something was terribly

1874
01:43:13,721 --> 01:43:16,870
wrong. So we tried to like, you know,
stop. You started to try to sit down.

1875
01:43:16,871 --> 01:43:19,430
Like there's so much that a
guy like him who's a, just a,

1876
01:43:19,700 --> 01:43:23,590
a furious killer watch like the Gerald
McClellan, Gillian Jackson fight,

1877
01:43:23,680 --> 01:43:27,370
Julian Jackson rather if you want
to see some, some crazy barbaric,

1878
01:43:27,371 --> 01:43:29,390
top of the food chain, KL, KL,

1879
01:43:29,470 --> 01:43:32,950
action boxers going at it because Julian
Jackson was like one of the hardest

1880
01:43:32,951 --> 01:43:37,570
punchers ever and Gerald Mcclellan
fucked him up and it's a crazy fight.

1881
01:43:37,570 --> 01:43:39,280
It's a fun boxing fight to watch.

1882
01:43:39,610 --> 01:43:42,880
But so Roy Jones jr saw that man
and never wanted to be that guy.

1883
01:43:42,881 --> 01:43:45,310
He was always scared that he
would be lecture on McClellan man.

1884
01:43:45,550 --> 01:43:48,280
He was always scared that he would have
some serious brain damage and he would

1885
01:43:48,281 --> 01:43:51,130
get really badly hurt.
So he never took any damage.

1886
01:43:51,560 --> 01:43:56,560
He fought so smart in his reflexes
were so good up until he fought Antonio

1887
01:43:56,630 --> 01:44:00,110
Tarver. He never really got fucked
up and then he beat John Ruiz.

1888
01:44:00,111 --> 01:44:02,990
He went all the way up to heavyweight
and who knows what he did to get to

1889
01:44:02,991 --> 01:44:06,380
heavyweight cause he was like 200 pounds
and shredded and that's not normal.

1890
01:44:06,381 --> 01:44:10,370
Usually when you do that you're doing
some sort of testosterone or something.

1891
01:44:10,520 --> 01:44:13,880
You're taking something and when
a lot of people don't realize,

1892
01:44:13,881 --> 01:44:16,040
especially like fighters,
they don't know who to turn to.

1893
01:44:16,190 --> 01:44:17,660
They get their advice from,
you know,

1894
01:44:17,661 --> 01:44:21,230
from either shitty doctors or they get
their advice from bodybuilders that are

1895
01:44:21,231 --> 01:44:22,400
their friends or something like that.

1896
01:44:22,690 --> 01:44:26,270
What what people don't understand about
hormones is if you join your body,

1897
01:44:26,271 --> 01:44:30,260
you make your body like a
hyper testosterone levels
where they're far above

1898
01:44:30,261 --> 01:44:34,220
normal. What happens is
afterwards your shit crashes.

1899
01:44:34,280 --> 01:44:38,180
So when you get off this testosterone,
if you take some crazy amount of, of,

1900
01:44:38,181 --> 01:44:41,270
of testosterone in your system,
your ball shut down.

1901
01:44:41,330 --> 01:44:44,840
So you need double the time that
you were on that shit to recover.

1902
01:44:44,990 --> 01:44:47,390
So say if you went on a
cycle and you were Roy Jones,

1903
01:44:47,391 --> 01:44:50,750
this is hypothetically speaking and
decided to gain 20 pounds of muscle.

1904
01:44:51,010 --> 01:44:53,480
If you are on a cycle of
steroids for three months,

1905
01:44:53,570 --> 01:44:57,890
you need six months just to get your shit
down to a normal level again. You're,

1906
01:44:57,891 --> 01:45:00,200
you're shit, it's fucked up man.
Your balls aren't working anymore.

1907
01:45:00,290 --> 01:45:02,760
You're doing something that your
body's not supposed to have you,

1908
01:45:02,780 --> 01:45:04,520
but he's not supposed to
have these levels in it.

1909
01:45:04,670 --> 01:45:06,140
And so when your body has those levels,

1910
01:45:06,141 --> 01:45:09,350
it's shuts off natural production and
it takes a while for that shit to kick

1911
01:45:09,351 --> 01:45:12,050
back in. And if you watch the
difference between Roy Jones,

1912
01:45:12,051 --> 01:45:16,000
his body from the Antonio Tarver
fight to the genre Weise fight,

1913
01:45:16,001 --> 01:45:16,611
the genre is fight.

1914
01:45:16,611 --> 01:45:18,860
He fought at heavyweight and the
next fight is at light heavyweight.

1915
01:45:19,040 --> 01:45:22,430
And he was like smooth.
It looked like you had no muscle tone.

1916
01:45:22,460 --> 01:45:24,080
It just didn't look good man.
And he did.

1917
01:45:24,110 --> 01:45:28,010
He looks slow and Antonio Tarver knocked
him the fuck out and there was a first

1918
01:45:28,011 --> 01:45:32,030
time you ever got knocked out. And, and
from that point on it was all downhill.

1919
01:45:32,090 --> 01:45:35,720
And then he fought Glenn Johnson
and Glen Johnson fucked him up.

1920
01:45:35,721 --> 01:45:40,220
Glen Johnson knocked him unconscious,
dead, stiff legged, you know, just eat,

1921
01:45:40,460 --> 01:45:43,670
you know that arms up in the air
when they're just out cold like that.

1922
01:45:43,671 --> 01:45:46,550
Glen Johnson did that to him.
And then ever since then, man,

1923
01:45:46,551 --> 01:45:51,500
it's been a slow slide. You know,
he fought scared against Hopkins.

1924
01:45:51,501 --> 01:45:53,180
He didn't,
it didn't go after Hopkins.

1925
01:45:53,181 --> 01:45:57,200
He just was happy to win a decision or
happy to rather to lose a decision and

1926
01:45:57,201 --> 01:45:59,810
did not get knocked out. He never
tried to win that fight. You know,

1927
01:45:59,811 --> 01:46:02,900
Hopkins was just too good for him and
you know, and then he fought that guy,

1928
01:46:02,901 --> 01:46:04,010
Danny Green and Australia.

1929
01:46:04,011 --> 01:46:07,040
He got knocked out in the first round
and then he fought this Russian dude and

1930
01:46:07,041 --> 01:46:10,040
got knocked the fuck out in the
last round and it was ugly dude.

1931
01:46:10,160 --> 01:46:14,400
He froze up like halfway,
like like was crumbling and the referee,

1932
01:46:14,440 --> 01:46:17,570
the guy looks at the referee and the
referee wouldn't stop it, so he goes,

1933
01:46:17,571 --> 01:46:18,230
all right,

1934
01:46:18,230 --> 01:46:23,230
pop bang while he's crumbling while like
Roy Jones essentially slowly crumbling.

1935
01:46:24,320 --> 01:46:28,970
This dude tees off with two full power
shots and he face plants of completely

1936
01:46:28,971 --> 01:46:33,560
unconscious and so then he goes on HBO
a couple of weeks later and he can't say

1937
01:46:33,561 --> 01:46:37,700
spectacular. We are, we are
watching the slow slide.

1938
01:46:37,701 --> 01:46:41,540
We are watching everything that that guy
was terrified of when he was a 20 year

1939
01:46:41,541 --> 01:46:44,660
old phenom when he was on top
of the world. Lighten people up.

1940
01:46:44,840 --> 01:46:47,630
What about that rap song that he did?
Can we do put it?

1941
01:46:47,660 --> 01:46:50,190
You've got to talk into the microphone.
We can't that you know that. Yeah.

1942
01:46:50,191 --> 01:46:54,020
That's all. Must've forgot. Yeah, we need
to see. We need to hear that. Yeah. No,

1943
01:46:54,060 --> 01:46:57,210
I don't think we can man.
But now that we're on a serious,

1944
01:46:57,540 --> 01:47:00,390
we're on Sirius satellite radio. We're
not allowed to play music anymore at all.

1945
01:47:00,391 --> 01:47:02,240
He gets sued. You see this shit? Yeah.

1946
01:47:02,241 --> 01:47:04,910
The Nebraska power plant is about
to get fucking flooding here.

1947
01:47:04,930 --> 01:47:07,750
Here's a question. Why?
Why do we get the pictures?

1948
01:47:08,320 --> 01:47:09,940
Obviously they've have flooding problem

1949
01:47:10,150 --> 01:47:13,090
show Eddie that photo because
it's just a trip to see the photo.

1950
01:47:13,260 --> 01:47:15,370
It's a nuclear power plant, Bro. Wow.

1951
01:47:15,470 --> 01:47:20,470
Why isn't there a wall at least the
size of maybe 10 times the height of the

1952
01:47:21,921 --> 01:47:26,210
current wall around the whole entire
place if it's near water or the ability to

1953
01:47:26,211 --> 01:47:26,890
get flooded?

1954
01:47:26,890 --> 01:47:29,800
Well, there's a lot of floods going
on, man, that nobody ever anticipated.

1955
01:47:29,830 --> 01:47:33,340
You know what we're finding out right
now with Japan and what we're finding out

1956
01:47:33,341 --> 01:47:35,320
with this as well is there's,
there's not,

1957
01:47:35,321 --> 01:47:38,260
they didn't do a whole lot of what ifs
when they built these fucking things,

1958
01:47:38,280 --> 01:47:39,610
right. You know, they, first of all,

1959
01:47:39,611 --> 01:47:42,880
they don't have any options to shut
them down if they don't have any power.

1960
01:47:43,030 --> 01:47:45,970
When they lost the backup generators
in Japan and every got everything got

1961
01:47:45,971 --> 01:47:47,200
flooded out by the tsunami,

1962
01:47:47,470 --> 01:47:50,500
they had essentially they had eight hours
before the thing started melting down.

1963
01:47:50,590 --> 01:47:55,090
They're fucked. There's no way to
stop it. They made these crazy things.

1964
01:47:55,091 --> 01:47:58,300
He's fusion or fission reactors
whenever they are fusion or fission.

1965
01:47:58,301 --> 01:48:00,490
Which one is it? Nuclear fusion.
I think it's fusion, fusion,

1966
01:48:00,550 --> 01:48:04,230
whatever the fuck it is. This incredible
amount of energy in this one, you know,

1967
01:48:04,260 --> 01:48:08,550
one isolated area and they can't stop it.
They don't know how to stop it. Those,

1968
01:48:08,560 --> 01:48:10,180
the what's going on in Japan right now,
man,

1969
01:48:10,360 --> 01:48:14,860
the Michio Kaku just wrote
a really fascinating and
terrifying article about it,

1970
01:48:15,040 --> 01:48:17,690
about how the three
complete meltdowns in the,

1971
01:48:17,700 --> 01:48:19,960
in those plants in Japan and you know,

1972
01:48:19,961 --> 01:48:22,270
there's people online that are in
denial about this. For some reason,

1973
01:48:22,271 --> 01:48:24,640
like someone in my mess, my
message board was, you know,

1974
01:48:24,660 --> 01:48:26,770
a thread about this
was like, oh, you know,

1975
01:48:26,771 --> 01:48:30,310
you're giving out misinformation about
your parents. Not that bad. Like the fuck.

1976
01:48:30,311 --> 01:48:31,144
It's not man.

1977
01:48:31,180 --> 01:48:35,020
There's video online on Youtube of people
that live miles and miles away that

1978
01:48:35,021 --> 01:48:38,260
have taken Geiger counters and they
walk around with a Geiger counter on and

1979
01:48:38,261 --> 01:48:40,480
then they take the guy your counter
and they put the Geiger counter on the

1980
01:48:40,481 --> 01:48:44,140
ground. And that's when it's fucking
terrifying because in the air,

1981
01:48:44,141 --> 01:48:47,530
when you walk it around it looks like,
yeah, it's a little radiate radioactive,

1982
01:48:47,531 --> 01:48:48,520
but not too bad.

1983
01:48:48,790 --> 01:48:51,640
But then when you put the fucking thing
on the ground is a couple of videos like

1984
01:48:51,641 --> 01:48:52,720
this.
You see the,

1985
01:48:52,721 --> 01:48:57,370
the fucking levels are off the charts
like way into the levels where people

1986
01:48:57,371 --> 01:49:00,490
aren't supposed to be anywhere near
Harris. Yeah. And it's on the ground, man.

1987
01:49:00,520 --> 01:49:02,920
It's on the fucking ground because
that's where apparently the, the,

1988
01:49:02,930 --> 01:49:05,950
all the radioactivity collects,
it collects on the ground.

1989
01:49:06,220 --> 01:49:09,280
So this guy takes this re this Geiger
counter and puts it on the ground.

1990
01:49:09,460 --> 01:49:10,450
So I'm freaking out,
man.

1991
01:49:10,451 --> 01:49:13,680
So I bought some Geiger counters on
Amazon and try to buy some Geiger counters

1992
01:49:13,840 --> 01:49:17,710
it. Yeah. Especially after we had the
conversation about Rocketdyne Rocketdyne,

1993
01:49:17,711 --> 01:49:20,300
which is only, you know, fucking 10
miles from here. Something like that.

1994
01:49:20,301 --> 01:49:24,760
It had a total meltdown supposedly in
the 50s that's probably where the zombies

1995
01:49:24,761 --> 01:49:27,640
would start. Right? In Japan. Yeah. Dude,

1996
01:49:27,641 --> 01:49:31,420
I think we should do what Japan is just
to help those fucking people that are

1997
01:49:31,480 --> 01:49:32,500
anywhere near that place.

1998
01:49:32,501 --> 01:49:35,920
Help them get out and then use that as
a place to store the world's garbage.

1999
01:49:36,410 --> 01:49:40,210
That place idea. Your idea. I've been
saying that on stage for weeks. Page.

2000
01:49:40,410 --> 01:49:41,243
Yeah,
and I said,

2001
01:49:41,610 --> 01:49:44,940
I'm the one that said that like dare you
like to pump podcasts ago. I said that.

2002
01:49:44,970 --> 01:49:47,710
I was like, we should use
nuclear places to put our trash.

2003
01:49:48,190 --> 01:49:51,940
You don't remember that dude. I send that
to you. Think you said that before me.

2004
01:49:51,970 --> 01:49:54,430
Yeah. Yeah, I did, but no,
it's not. Not before me.

2005
01:49:54,431 --> 01:49:57,130
Before I saw it on stage and brought
100% I dumped that bitch. No,

2006
01:49:57,131 --> 01:49:58,990
cause when I said you're like,
that's actually a really good idea.

2007
01:49:59,380 --> 01:50:03,640
He might be right now that I think about
it. Either way. It's a perfect idea.

2008
01:50:03,700 --> 01:50:06,190
It's a perfect idea. Yeah. I think
it's an awesome, whoever's idea it was.

2009
01:50:06,191 --> 01:50:10,570
Maybe it was yours. I smoke too much
weed. If it was your idea, right.

2010
01:50:10,571 --> 01:50:12,940
And then Joe Zombies Zombie
was a movie right there.

2011
01:50:13,030 --> 01:50:16,810
A spot where we could just dump garbage,
garbage right into the whole of it.

2012
01:50:16,870 --> 01:50:19,960
Fly over in a helicopter and just drop
it right into the, what would happen?

2013
01:50:20,320 --> 01:50:23,340
Well hopefully this a, what is that
thing called? That's making a black hole,

2014
01:50:23,390 --> 01:50:25,810
hopefully turns into a
really bad black hole.

2015
01:50:25,810 --> 01:50:27,280
And then we can just put the
garbage on the black hole,

2016
01:50:28,060 --> 01:50:31,030
the large hadron collider so we could
litter litter in other galaxies.

2017
01:50:31,710 --> 01:50:35,710
It's terrible.
I D [inaudible] crying,

2018
01:50:36,730 --> 01:50:38,680
you know,
they have hyper Novas in space.

2019
01:50:38,681 --> 01:50:41,680
They find these hyper knows that
are there basically these uh,

2020
01:50:41,740 --> 01:50:45,490
these like really super powerful knows
that I have these jets of energy spraying

2021
01:50:45,491 --> 01:50:48,310
out in either direction.
What if that was garbage?

2022
01:50:48,550 --> 01:50:49,870
What if we got like really close?

2023
01:50:49,871 --> 01:50:54,610
We saw like cans and shit and rubbers and
it turns out that all that shit spring

2024
01:50:54,611 --> 01:50:56,620
out was the garbage of another dementia.

2025
01:50:56,950 --> 01:51:00,580
They had figured out how to launch all
of their garbage with a rocket ship into

2026
01:51:00,581 --> 01:51:04,800
black holes. The planets all
clean, super clean like that.

2027
01:51:04,840 --> 01:51:08,200
Walk around with a portable like
connection to that black hole. I saw.

2028
01:51:08,201 --> 01:51:11,200
Another thing that I see and I'm going
to report on this cause this is number

2029
01:51:11,201 --> 01:51:13,780
nine for me.
This is the ninth time I've seen this.

2030
01:51:13,900 --> 01:51:18,890
A fucking guy in a Prius throwing a
cigarette out the window. God Damn,

2031
01:51:18,891 --> 01:51:19,840
that drives me crazy.

2032
01:51:19,960 --> 01:51:24,910
This motherfucker pulled into a organic
foods parking lot of an organic food

2033
01:51:24,911 --> 01:51:28,420
store, gets out of his Prius and throws
his fucking cigarette on the ground.

2034
01:51:28,720 --> 01:51:32,890
I'm like, you cunt. You
dumb, dumb, dumb cunt.

2035
01:51:33,280 --> 01:51:35,950
You stupid.
Fuck what?

2036
01:51:35,951 --> 01:51:39,580
What kind of a person goes so far to
think they're helping the environment by

2037
01:51:39,730 --> 01:51:43,450
buying a Prius. He had a ponytail
on so he's like, I'm living natural.

2038
01:51:43,451 --> 01:51:46,000
I'm going to go get some natural organic
food and I'm just going to throw my

2039
01:51:46,001 --> 01:51:49,030
cigarette right there,
king of the hill episode.

2040
01:51:49,180 --> 01:51:50,350
Did it really do and I can get the hell.

2041
01:51:50,470 --> 01:51:54,760
He started working at a whole
foods and it's similar to that.

2042
01:51:55,050 --> 01:51:56,920
Didn't throw cigarettes out
the window at whole foods.

2043
01:51:57,070 --> 01:52:01,720
They had Prius's and never, ever just
constantly contradicting themselves.

2044
01:52:02,110 --> 01:52:05,530
Well, it's people, man. I've
seen nine times now, nine times.

2045
01:52:05,531 --> 01:52:07,750
I've seen a guy in a Prius throw
a cigarette out the window.

2046
01:52:07,780 --> 01:52:11,140
Nine over the course of my entire life.
This is the ninth guy.

2047
01:52:11,170 --> 01:52:13,960
I've been documenting them.
The last one was in San Francisco,

2048
01:52:14,200 --> 01:52:17,650
the last one in San Francisco. I
saw two in a weekend. I was there.

2049
01:52:17,680 --> 01:52:21,550
I was there Thursday through
Sunday working at Cobbs
and I saw two guys in their

2050
01:52:21,551 --> 01:52:24,970
fucking Prius's throw cigarettes
out the window. That's incredible.

2051
01:52:24,971 --> 01:52:26,950
It's incredible. Videotape
it. Put It on, you know,

2052
01:52:27,140 --> 01:52:30,850
do you never know to have your fucking
camera? How like there's a kind of Prius,

2053
01:52:30,851 --> 01:52:32,980
let's follow him and smoking.
I know he's got this. Fuck,

2054
01:52:32,981 --> 01:52:34,420
he's going to throw it
out the fucking window.

2055
01:52:35,230 --> 01:52:40,230
Gizmodo also has a article about LSD
being used to treat what they call suicide

2056
01:52:40,541 --> 01:52:41,374
headaches,

2057
01:52:41,470 --> 01:52:45,040
which are people that have really bad
headaches to the point where they almost

2058
01:52:45,150 --> 01:52:46,070
to kill themselves,
like

2059
01:52:46,070 --> 01:52:49,860
migraines times a billion. Right? So
these two psychiatrists have been, uh,

2060
01:52:49,910 --> 01:52:51,860
giving Lsd to these patients.

2061
01:52:52,010 --> 01:52:56,290
And I think they said like
almost all the patients, uh,

2062
01:52:56,540 --> 01:53:00,430
all six patients reported decrease in
the number of cluster attacks and fives

2063
01:53:00,431 --> 01:53:04,250
have this effect lasted four
months after they had taken LSD.

2064
01:53:04,320 --> 01:53:06,390
Well,
if they had the right dosage of Lsd,

2065
01:53:06,391 --> 01:53:09,180
if you could administer it in a laboratory
and you knew exactly what you were

2066
01:53:09,181 --> 01:53:12,810
getting. There was an article
really recently that said that Mtma,

2067
01:53:12,900 --> 01:53:17,510
which is ecstasy and Lsd, let's
beautiful, far, far closer to being, uh,

2068
01:53:17,511 --> 01:53:21,990
available for prescription than anybody
would really imagine really far closer.

2069
01:53:22,070 --> 01:53:26,480
I tell you, man, that is one of the
most beautiful drugs in the road.

2070
01:53:26,750 --> 01:53:30,680
Credible Molly,
pure ecstasy or whatever it is.

2071
01:53:31,100 --> 01:53:33,230
I can't get enough of it.
But what's weird,

2072
01:53:33,231 --> 01:53:37,190
it's recently I bought some
ecstasy and I didn't feel the same.

2073
01:53:37,191 --> 01:53:41,180
I've normal XSD feeling. And you came
in and talking like Roy Jones allegedly.

2074
01:53:41,420 --> 01:53:45,710
And uh, uh, and so I was telling him this
other guy I know, I'm like, Hey, yeah.

2075
01:53:45,711 --> 01:53:50,260
So I got the stuff, it looked like Molly,
but the guy said was ecstasy and uh,

2076
01:53:50,340 --> 01:53:53,840
and it did this, this was my effects on
it. He goes, oh yeah, that's bath salts.

2077
01:53:53,841 --> 01:53:57,130
People are actually selling that as
ecstasy a lot in la right now. It's like,

2078
01:53:57,140 --> 01:54:00,440
I've seen US basketball.
Hey, did that mess fast?

2079
01:54:00,441 --> 01:54:03,980
So in the house you're retarded. Yeah,
I was doing whatever people get it.

2080
01:54:03,981 --> 01:54:08,360
And what's funny is that it felt, it
felt like ecstasy. Like it started like,

2081
01:54:08,361 --> 01:54:13,110
okay, here it goes. I'm feeling
good, feeling good, and I
guess I'm tired. Goodnight.

2082
01:54:13,880 --> 01:54:17,090
It was, it almost got to the
point, God like euphoric,

2083
01:54:17,480 --> 01:54:21,650
euphoric body kind of feeling good. Kind
of, kind of like the ecstasy feeling,

2084
01:54:21,651 --> 01:54:24,080
but then it just fizzles off.
Every ecstasy

2085
01:54:24,170 --> 01:54:28,030
have that, that that
next day, Blah feeling.

2086
01:54:28,110 --> 01:54:33,110
Well I was using on it labs
dotcoms roll on and roll off.

2087
01:54:33,151 --> 01:54:36,910
So I had no feeling the next
day I felt fine. This is real.

2088
01:54:36,930 --> 01:54:38,650
This stuff really works.
The on stuff

2089
01:54:38,850 --> 01:54:41,840
I gave that shit the, the,
the nootropic formula. Eddie,

2090
01:54:41,841 --> 01:54:44,060
do you know we're making a brain pill.
Oh wait,

2091
01:54:44,190 --> 01:54:47,450
I got to talk about this to
make it a brain pill. We're
making a neutral. No, no,

2092
01:54:47,451 --> 01:54:49,990
no. Me and Chris Markus criminal. Chris
mark is doing all the work. We're gonna,

2093
01:54:49,991 --> 01:54:53,280
I'm gonna help promote it. But uh,
he started a laboratory when he left.

2094
01:54:53,281 --> 01:54:56,070
Fleshlight started a laboratory for a,

2095
01:54:56,080 --> 01:54:59,170
he's been on the podcast a bunch
of times and twice. And uh,

2096
01:54:59,190 --> 01:55:03,630
he decided to come up with
his own business and one
of them was that there's a

2097
01:55:03,631 --> 01:55:04,860
bunch of different nootropics,

2098
01:55:04,861 --> 01:55:09,000
a bunch of different like supplements
that can aid in brain function.

2099
01:55:09,210 --> 01:55:10,650
And what he did is kind nightmares,

2100
01:55:10,710 --> 01:55:13,860
combine all the best ones
and put them together. Dude,

2101
01:55:13,861 --> 01:55:15,530
they give you the craziest fucking,

2102
01:55:15,580 --> 01:55:17,600
well that's when I had the Arnold
Schwarzenegger. What else? What's on here?

2103
01:55:17,810 --> 01:55:18,281
My girlfriend,

2104
01:55:18,281 --> 01:55:22,180
I had been letting her have some of it
nightmares really cause he's just intense

2105
01:55:22,210 --> 01:55:25,090
nightmares and I didn't have
nightmares but I had intense dreams.

2106
01:55:25,640 --> 01:55:28,600
You said after you said that
I started actually realizing,

2107
01:55:28,630 --> 01:55:30,040
oh it's because of that.

2108
01:55:32,800 --> 01:55:36,270
No they're not. They're not.
Um, well maybe like that,

2109
01:55:36,271 --> 01:55:37,620
but this is going to be much stronger.

2110
01:55:37,621 --> 01:55:40,970
And this stuff is like super called brain
factors and I like can't go below but

2111
01:55:41,200 --> 01:55:44,000
everything,
everything for the brain in one formula.

2112
01:55:44,010 --> 01:55:47,100
I don't know what his levels were and
what stuff he had as opposed to what stuff

2113
01:55:47,101 --> 01:55:49,770
Chris has had. I would like to look at
the two of them, but whatever it is,

2114
01:55:49,771 --> 01:55:51,120
this shit that Chris has put together,

2115
01:55:51,121 --> 01:55:54,480
he's thoroughly researched this and
come up with this incredible formula.

2116
01:55:54,870 --> 01:55:57,540
It really fucking works. First of
all, it really freaky thing is, man,

2117
01:55:57,541 --> 01:55:59,970
you don't get tired on this shit.
That's the weird thing.

2118
01:56:00,120 --> 01:56:02,910
Like if I travel all the
way across the country,

2119
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:06,180
you would figure by the time I get there,
five hours later I'm exhausted. Right?

2120
01:56:06,360 --> 01:56:09,650
But when I take these fucking pills,
man, we did a show on Friday. We've,

2121
01:56:09,651 --> 01:56:13,020
we threw it, flew a red eye. All
right, landed Friday morning.

2122
01:56:14,070 --> 01:56:17,880
I didn't sleep at all. I slept a little
bit on the plane. I ate something,

2123
01:56:17,970 --> 01:56:21,990
got in the shower, went to the UFC, Wayans
went from the Wayans and got some food,

2124
01:56:21,991 --> 01:56:26,790
ate food. W W W worked over my
material, went over some of my material,

2125
01:56:26,970 --> 01:56:29,970
gotten with Joey, we smoked
a joint, went onstage,

2126
01:56:30,060 --> 01:56:33,600
then did our show afterwards wanting
to hang out with Ralphie May.

2127
01:56:33,750 --> 01:56:36,540
Afterwards we went to a
strip club afterwards,

2128
01:56:36,600 --> 01:56:40,530
came back to the hotel and I'm still
awake. I'm like, how the fuck am I awake?

2129
01:56:40,531 --> 01:56:44,550
And then I realized I took six of those
fucking pills. I took three earlier.

2130
01:56:44,640 --> 01:56:45,780
Three. Yeah. Cause I was exhausted.

2131
01:56:45,930 --> 01:56:49,700
I took three in the morning and then
three like an hour before the show. Wow.

2132
01:56:49,740 --> 01:56:52,920
Woo Dog.
Just figured some shit out man.

2133
01:56:53,560 --> 01:56:56,160
That's the crazy thing
is when you have dreams,

2134
01:56:56,161 --> 01:56:58,500
the dreams are super vivid and
you can remember them, man.

2135
01:56:58,580 --> 01:57:01,550
It's because your mind's eye
that whatever receptors awake,

2136
01:57:01,610 --> 01:57:02,320
it's something's awake.

2137
01:57:02,320 --> 01:57:05,030
That's usually not a wait cause that's
like when we were talking about nicotine

2138
01:57:05,031 --> 01:57:08,370
where it keeps your nicotine receptors
in your head awake when you're on United,

2139
01:57:08,400 --> 01:57:11,000
do a patch while you're sleeping,
whatever's in that shit.

2140
01:57:11,030 --> 01:57:13,140
It has something that it's reacting to.

2141
01:57:13,930 --> 01:57:14,200
Well,

2142
01:57:14,200 --> 01:57:17,610
what I was impressed with is that I had
some good ideas and I didn't want to get

2143
01:57:17,611 --> 01:57:20,250
up and write them down and I
actually remembered them. Oh really?

2144
01:57:20,370 --> 01:57:23,820
That's never happens. That never
happened. It feels sharper. Definitely.

2145
01:57:23,850 --> 01:57:26,070
I was going over that video.
You know there's a video.

2146
01:57:26,071 --> 01:57:29,640
Have you seen it online of a,
the Miss USA pageant contestants.

2147
01:57:29,641 --> 01:57:32,960
They asking them about evolution.
Yeah. Have you seen it? Yeah, I saw it.

2148
01:57:32,970 --> 01:57:35,490
Pull that shit up cause it's fucking
fascinating. Pull it up and we'll just,

2149
01:57:35,491 --> 01:57:38,010
we'll play a little bit of it. Cause
it's, it's the most ridiculous shit ever.

2150
01:57:38,190 --> 01:57:40,710
And they get these girls and
all of them from the deep south,

2151
01:57:40,860 --> 01:57:43,330
all of them don't believe in evolution.
They're all like,

2152
01:57:43,440 --> 01:57:47,820
well I don't believe in evolution. You
know, and I'm thinking while I'm there,

2153
01:57:47,821 --> 01:57:49,830
I'm of course you don't believe
in evolution. You 20 years old,

2154
01:57:50,010 --> 01:57:53,220
nobody's ever caveman fucked you. Nobody
ever gorilla. Fuck do you? You don't,

2155
01:57:53,221 --> 01:57:55,170
you don't know what darkness really is.

2156
01:57:55,320 --> 01:57:57,210
You don't know that there
are shades to man. There's a,

2157
01:57:57,211 --> 01:57:58,380
there's a whole progression.

2158
01:57:58,381 --> 01:58:02,910
There's a fucking spectrum
of human behavior from really
civilized and beautiful

2159
01:58:02,911 --> 01:58:06,960
and nice to barbaric and animalistic and
that shits because we came from fucking

2160
01:58:06,961 --> 01:58:09,930
animals hooker. You, you just haven't
even, I haven't experienced that yet.

2161
01:58:09,931 --> 01:58:12,720
And your, your little cute life
with your sash on your fucking,

2162
01:58:13,680 --> 01:58:17,100
I remembered it all vividly when I
woke up in the morning. What is the,

2163
01:58:17,490 --> 01:58:18,560
we don't really have to see it.
Yeah,

2164
01:58:18,710 --> 01:58:22,350
it's really a low fruit as low
hanging fruit. It's, it's just really,

2165
01:58:22,351 --> 01:58:25,710
really poor dumb girls that are 20
years old and they're asking him about

2166
01:58:25,711 --> 01:58:28,860
evolution and they're saying things
that they want people to hear. Well,

2167
01:58:28,861 --> 01:58:32,670
I think Jesus put me here for a purpose
because they think that all the people

2168
01:58:32,671 --> 01:58:34,350
from their church and
all the people back home,

2169
01:58:34,351 --> 01:58:36,610
that's what they would want to hear.
You know, when you're 20 years old,

2170
01:58:36,640 --> 01:58:39,060
you're indoctrinated into the world
of religion. What are the odds of,

2171
01:58:39,061 --> 01:58:42,100
you actually have a real opinion of it.
You actually sat down and

2172
01:58:42,100 --> 01:58:43,090
sorted the shit out.

2173
01:58:43,270 --> 01:58:45,820
Most of the time they're just spitting
out shit that other people had been

2174
01:58:45,821 --> 01:58:48,430
saying to them their whole
life. You know, 20 years old.

2175
01:58:48,431 --> 01:58:50,380
The fuck did you know
when you were 20 you know,

2176
01:58:50,381 --> 01:58:53,530
could you imagine if somebody had you
on video talking about what you thought

2177
01:58:53,531 --> 01:58:57,190
about the world when you were 20 I was
an atheist at 20 do you got to talk in

2178
01:58:57,191 --> 01:58:59,350
the mic, Bro? I was an atheist at 20

2179
01:59:00,510 --> 01:59:04,440
yeah, I have a video made top 20 just
smoking weed with a bunch of my friends.

2180
01:59:04,470 --> 01:59:08,400
That's all I all I cared about
smoking weed and music. Yeah.

2181
01:59:08,401 --> 01:59:10,930
Well you probably just, you
were stuck in Ohio too, man.

2182
01:59:11,700 --> 01:59:14,540
You know what the fuck you were
in Columbus. What am I doing?

2183
01:59:14,580 --> 01:59:17,340
You're all over the place now that you're,
your shit's blowing the fuck up.

2184
01:59:17,341 --> 01:59:20,700
You're planning a 10th of planets.
Are you ever at home?

2185
01:59:20,710 --> 01:59:22,500
Are you going out to a
different city every week?

2186
01:59:22,501 --> 01:59:26,130
Are you doing classes at Buddy's buddy?
What you're talking about when you,

2187
01:59:26,160 --> 01:59:29,310
what do you were talking, you were
saying 10 planets. Planets. Yeah, just,

2188
01:59:29,311 --> 01:59:32,430
just schools. But you, you have them all
over the place. How many do you have now?

2189
01:59:32,820 --> 01:59:34,080
Around 30.
Wow.

2190
01:59:34,650 --> 01:59:37,390
And so you're traveling pretty much
every weekend and do a seminar.

2191
01:59:37,391 --> 01:59:39,750
And one of them,
I'm trying to do two a month.

2192
01:59:39,840 --> 01:59:43,620
And for me they cation and staying in la,
staying home and I like,

2193
01:59:43,860 --> 01:59:47,670
I like being at my house. I love hanging
out with my bunny and my girlfriend.

2194
01:59:47,880 --> 01:59:51,300
Just relax and go check out a movie.
Just doing nothing,

2195
01:59:51,900 --> 01:59:54,600
doing nothing at home when you have a
day when you don't have to fucking be

2196
01:59:54,601 --> 01:59:56,160
anywhere.
So beautiful.

2197
01:59:56,630 --> 02:00:00,840
So I try to try to stay home two
weekends out of the month, you know,

2198
02:00:00,930 --> 02:00:02,790
that's why I quit the UFC as well.

2199
02:00:02,860 --> 02:00:06,540
I was trying to make it to my schools
and do the FC. I'd be gone every weekend.

2200
02:00:06,870 --> 02:00:09,020
Just can't do it. Well that's
good that the school, uh,

2201
02:00:09,190 --> 02:00:12,540
your schools have become quite successful
now and you, and it's so funny.

2202
02:00:12,541 --> 02:00:16,020
I see your shirt,
your logo at all these places.

2203
02:00:16,021 --> 02:00:17,640
I would be just sitting there
and I'm like, Oh my God,

2204
02:00:17,641 --> 02:00:20,280
that guy has a 10th planet shirt on
and it makes me almost want to be like,

2205
02:00:20,281 --> 02:00:22,350
hey dude, what's up? You're
not like, I feel like, oh,

2206
02:00:22,351 --> 02:00:26,580
they all know Eddie's take Jujitsu. I
got an already to do it for a year. Well,

2207
02:00:26,581 --> 02:00:30,280
one my knee to time. You need
Zell fucked up. All right.

2208
02:00:30,300 --> 02:00:33,590
It will pop out of place in Jujitsu. Oh,
probably. I'm not going to risk that.

2209
02:00:33,591 --> 02:00:36,570
That was the last time it popped out of
place for popped out once and then once

2210
02:00:36,571 --> 02:00:38,970
it was close popping out
where it felt like it did.

2211
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:43,980
How long after you actually injury
was that popped out? Uh, three years.

2212
02:00:43,981 --> 02:00:46,560
Four years? Yeah. It was
pretty far afterwards. Yeah,

2213
02:00:47,310 --> 02:00:48,960
it was skiing too and it was like,
oh my God.

2214
02:00:48,961 --> 02:00:51,350
Did it just pop out to fucking hurt or,
yeah,

2215
02:00:51,660 --> 02:00:54,480
you've got to develop a higher
tolerance to pain, son. I, you know,

2216
02:00:54,660 --> 02:00:55,900
I just don't have time.
Thank you.

2217
02:00:55,910 --> 02:00:56,770
Get from Jujitsu,
man,

2218
02:00:56,771 --> 02:00:59,620
you got a high tolerance to pain
because you're always in pain.

2219
02:00:59,800 --> 02:01:02,290
You always getting smashed. You always,
when you're next getting choked yours,

2220
02:01:02,291 --> 02:01:04,930
your face is getting smushed. You
know, like when you get tattooed,

2221
02:01:05,020 --> 02:01:07,600
like some people get tattooed
and they fucking scream in agony.

2222
02:01:07,750 --> 02:01:10,360
I fell asleep getting tattooed once,
literally nodded out.

2223
02:01:10,390 --> 02:01:12,490
Just you get used to putting it out.

2224
02:01:12,670 --> 02:01:16,660
You used to putting pain and then the
any martial art and you're hitting things

2225
02:01:16,661 --> 02:01:20,010
and Moy Thai guys, man, they don't
think they get accustomed to paying you.

2226
02:01:20,020 --> 02:01:22,330
You leg kicks always hurt, man.
They're going to hurt forever.

2227
02:01:22,670 --> 02:01:24,940
But you just get accustomed to that.
You just deal with it.

2228
02:01:25,090 --> 02:01:28,270
You know your legs certainly toughen
up. Especially your, you know,

2229
02:01:28,271 --> 02:01:30,640
your thighs toughen up and
your shins really toughen up.

2230
02:01:30,760 --> 02:01:34,150
They actually develop like little micro
fractures over the surface of your Shin

2231
02:01:34,151 --> 02:01:37,600
from clashing and other shins and kicking
fucking banana trees and shit like

2232
02:01:37,601 --> 02:01:38,440
that.
Like those,

2233
02:01:38,441 --> 02:01:41,720
those crazy tag ions that are
constantly kicking like banana trees,

2234
02:01:41,840 --> 02:01:44,990
they develop like shins that like
weapons man. You know, they've, they've,

2235
02:01:44,991 --> 02:01:49,850
there's like a sports science on it where
they showed um, uh, Melcher um, God,

2236
02:01:49,851 --> 02:01:52,120
I forget the last, his
name, his name, his phone,

2237
02:01:52,121 --> 02:01:55,630
but it is a phase a Moy Thai guy.
But uh,

2238
02:01:55,640 --> 02:01:59,150
he's a former world champion and they
had him kicked baseball bats and he was

2239
02:01:59,151 --> 02:02:03,560
breaking baseball bats
with his shins. Dude. Dude,

2240
02:02:03,561 --> 02:02:07,880
it was so crazy to watch
it just swing in that leg,

2241
02:02:07,881 --> 02:02:12,740
kick into a baseball bat and snap
in the handle off. Fuck that dude.

2242
02:02:12,800 --> 02:02:13,940
He did two different kinds of,

2243
02:02:13,941 --> 02:02:18,890
did an ash one and ash bat and a maple
bat because the ash bad apparently is a

2244
02:02:18,891 --> 02:02:21,680
little easier. So then he
moved to the maple one next. Oh

2245
02:02:23,730 --> 02:02:25,760
yeah.
That is grabbing my shins.

2246
02:02:26,690 --> 02:02:30,020
There's such a difference in striking the
difference in your striking in Jujitsu.

2247
02:02:30,170 --> 02:02:33,230
I mean, you can get hurt and both
of them, for sure. Miguel Torres,

2248
02:02:33,800 --> 02:02:36,560
former WCPC bantamweight
champion posted a picture,

2249
02:02:36,710 --> 02:02:41,630
worst Bjj injury ever at my gym and
it's a dude's toe. His toe got broken.

2250
02:02:41,631 --> 02:02:44,270
Have you seen it? You have to
see it. You need to look at it.

2251
02:02:44,540 --> 02:02:49,130
Do Toe got broken and snapped off and
the bone was sticking straight out. Dude,

2252
02:02:49,131 --> 02:02:53,570
it was ha ha, hard core. And I was
like, yeah, that can happen, man.

2253
02:02:53,630 --> 02:02:54,680
Dudes can get fucked up.

2254
02:02:54,800 --> 02:02:58,970
But it's striking you much more
likely to get Roy Jones and striking.

2255
02:02:59,120 --> 02:02:59,901
That shit is a,

2256
02:02:59,901 --> 02:03:03,080
that's shit's happening on a regular
dudes are constantly getting brained.

2257
02:03:03,410 --> 02:03:05,840
You know,
there's constantly getting knocked out.

2258
02:03:05,841 --> 02:03:07,550
There was a post on the
underground the other day,

2259
02:03:07,730 --> 02:03:10,160
some guy was talking about getting
knocked out and training, you know,

2260
02:03:10,161 --> 02:03:11,930
and how much it pissed you off.
Some,

2261
02:03:11,931 --> 02:03:14,150
some new guy came in and didn't
really know what he's doing,

2262
02:03:14,151 --> 02:03:16,340
swaying full blast and he didn't get
out of the way and he got knocked

2263
02:03:16,341 --> 02:03:20,270
unconscious, you know? And
it's fucking not good man.

2264
02:03:20,330 --> 02:03:23,630
When you watch something like Pat Barry
and check Congo does that shit, uh,

2265
02:03:23,660 --> 02:03:25,880
does that Shit Register with you?
Do you see that and go, whoa,

2266
02:03:25,881 --> 02:03:30,750
like what's what's going on inside Pat
Barry's had right now and check congos

2267
02:03:30,760 --> 02:03:35,480
both of them got rained
on, you know? Yeah. I mean,

2268
02:03:35,481 --> 02:03:39,640
it was for a fan. It was amazing, but
I would never want to do that show.

2269
02:03:40,610 --> 02:03:43,940
I love watching it though,
but I'm not down for getting hit.

2270
02:03:44,120 --> 02:03:48,830
It'd be awesome if they could fix it.
You know? It's like, you know, if,

2271
02:03:48,831 --> 02:03:52,940
uh, if you tear a knee ligament, they
can fucking get another ligament,

2272
02:03:52,941 --> 02:03:56,360
stick it in there and screw it in place
and they can fix you up. Nice. You know,

2273
02:03:56,420 --> 02:03:59,120
if you like hurt your brain, they
go do it. Don't worry about it.

2274
02:03:59,121 --> 02:04:00,320
We're going to put you in his chamber.

2275
02:04:00,321 --> 02:04:03,200
It rejuvenating all your brain
cells and it's, you know,

2276
02:04:03,201 --> 02:04:04,730
you're going to be 100% a couple of weeks.

2277
02:04:04,820 --> 02:04:08,330
What if it was Chris Markus stuff
actually does that? I don't think so.

2278
02:04:09,250 --> 02:04:12,230
What's it's going to be a lot more
complicated than some herbs, I think.

2279
02:04:12,260 --> 02:04:14,690
I would think that if there's gonna be
something that regenerates brain tissue

2280
02:04:14,930 --> 02:04:17,590
that's injured, it's going to be
something like some nanotechnology,

2281
02:04:17,820 --> 02:04:22,820
something that re rehabilitates or fixes
tissue sponsor Roy Jones and see what

2282
02:04:23,721 --> 02:04:24,690
happens.
Oh,

2283
02:04:26,820 --> 02:04:30,770
we can Shakespearian
off the top of his head.

2284
02:04:31,460 --> 02:04:35,240
The crazy thing is he's not even
willing to retire. He owes taxes.

2285
02:04:35,270 --> 02:04:38,040
Apparently he was a three
point $5 million in taxes

2286
02:04:38,190 --> 02:04:41,820
according to my online sources
that I quickly googled.

2287
02:04:41,970 --> 02:04:45,920
How does someone with millions and
don't pay? Man, they don't fucking pay.

2288
02:04:45,921 --> 02:04:47,860
They just don't have enough
business manager and accountant.

2289
02:04:47,870 --> 02:04:51,720
They just get stupid man. They get
stupid, they get stupid. They just,

2290
02:04:51,721 --> 02:04:53,640
they just spend all that money and they,
you know,

2291
02:04:53,641 --> 02:04:56,010
they have some wacky motherfucker
that's handling their money.

2292
02:04:56,160 --> 02:04:58,680
Just like a kind of guy who would
have a wacky motherfucker handling his

2293
02:04:58,681 --> 02:04:59,514
hormones.

2294
02:04:59,640 --> 02:05:02,670
There's a guy that would have a wacky
motherfucker handling his money and that

2295
02:05:02,671 --> 02:05:05,460
guy tells you like Wesley Snipes
is dude told him, you know, hey,

2296
02:05:05,461 --> 02:05:08,280
you don't have to pay taxes man.
That shit is unconstitutional. Look,

2297
02:05:08,281 --> 02:05:09,540
I'll show you the closet is man,

2298
02:05:09,700 --> 02:05:11,610
they ain't even going to come after you
because they don't want anybody to know

2299
02:05:11,611 --> 02:05:13,640
about this. And they're like, oh yeah, no,

2300
02:05:13,641 --> 02:05:16,890
they're going to come after you and you're
going to have to go to jail for a few

2301
02:05:16,890 --> 02:05:20,020
years. You know, you're a movie star and
all of a sudden you're in jail. You're in.

2302
02:05:20,021 --> 02:05:23,610
He's still in jail. He's in jail
right now. He's in jail right now.

2303
02:05:23,760 --> 02:05:28,050
He's going to be in jail for three
years. They want to let people know, hey,

2304
02:05:28,170 --> 02:05:31,230
we will lock you in a fucking cage.
Stupid.

2305
02:05:31,410 --> 02:05:35,220
You need to pay us and you need to let
everybody know that you're paying and let

2306
02:05:35,221 --> 02:05:36,750
everybody know that they need to pay.

2307
02:05:37,050 --> 02:05:40,650
We all need money to make this fucking
thing work. No cops don't work for free,

2308
02:05:40,820 --> 02:05:43,350
you know it's not free to fix the
highways. We need fucking money.

2309
02:05:43,351 --> 02:05:46,050
Even if you don't agree with it,
even if it's too much and I agree it is.

2310
02:05:46,290 --> 02:05:48,260
It's definitely too much.
You've got to pay that shit anyways.

2311
02:05:48,261 --> 02:05:50,670
Side to put you in a
fucking cage. Right? Brian,

2312
02:05:51,220 --> 02:05:55,090
did you have some tax problems? I
still do. What's your tax problems now?

2313
02:05:55,091 --> 02:05:56,210
The states coming after me.

2314
02:05:57,730 --> 02:06:01,810
What did you do a use
TurboTax and blindly was like,

2315
02:06:01,870 --> 02:06:04,030
oh I have receipts for all this shit.

2316
02:06:04,300 --> 02:06:07,660
Thinking that I would just use my credit
card statements and then I didn't know

2317
02:06:07,661 --> 02:06:10,210
like credit card statements
only go back now like a year.

2318
02:06:10,360 --> 02:06:13,390
Like if you want to go back in time and
look at a statement or something like

2319
02:06:13,391 --> 02:06:17,290
that, they don't let you go any farther
than a year. You can't even find them now.

2320
02:06:17,620 --> 02:06:22,060
No. No. Whoa. I didn't know that so
cause I was doing my taxes thinking like,

2321
02:06:22,270 --> 02:06:22,841
oh yeah,

2322
02:06:22,841 --> 02:06:25,630
you know I got proof of purchase that
you know all my students that like the

2323
02:06:25,631 --> 02:06:28,630
bank getting together with the
fucking absolutely tax people.

2324
02:06:29,140 --> 02:06:32,020
Do you think that they conspired to like
let's just find a lot of people out of

2325
02:06:32,021 --> 02:06:34,360
money, man, we can get a lot
more money that way. Yeah.

2326
02:06:34,390 --> 02:06:39,100
All these assholes claiming
the deductibles and shit.
Yeah, it's stressful stuff,

2327
02:06:39,101 --> 02:06:39,460
man.

2328
02:06:39,460 --> 02:06:44,020
I've had a business lounge are now three
years and it relieves so much stress.

2329
02:06:44,050 --> 02:06:48,040
I don't think about shit.
If the government came after me,

2330
02:06:48,041 --> 02:06:51,100
I got all that shit under control now.
I just don't do it.

2331
02:06:51,130 --> 02:06:53,920
Even though I should be writing all this
shit off that I do and stuff like that.

2332
02:06:53,921 --> 02:06:56,680
Now I'm just like, you know what?
Fuck it. I'll just do like I do.

2333
02:06:56,740 --> 02:06:59,950
And why don't you go
to like H and r block?

2334
02:07:00,250 --> 02:07:03,070
Because it's like $1,000 or something like
that. I don't want to do it. I should.

2335
02:07:03,370 --> 02:07:07,270
Is it 1000 bucks? It's a couple
hundred bucks, man and r block.

2336
02:07:07,271 --> 02:07:09,160
I was doing that before I
got my business manager.

2337
02:07:09,220 --> 02:07:13,240
My girl right now just paid something like
$700 at h and r block to do her taxes.

2338
02:07:13,300 --> 02:07:15,730
Really. Maybe just robbed her
members. Like, Ooh, this bitch,

2339
02:07:15,760 --> 02:07:19,540
I'm gonna get her to give me a lot of
money. Yeah. I mean, to me, I'd rather,

2340
02:07:19,541 --> 02:07:22,260
you know, I hate taxes so much,
so I'd rather just go to TurboTax,

2341
02:07:22,270 --> 02:07:24,940
take 10 minutes and do it and
get it sent away, you know?

2342
02:07:24,941 --> 02:07:28,510
And then having to pay extra and try
to find money and do all that crap,

2343
02:07:28,511 --> 02:07:33,280
which I should do. Yeah, I got to go.
It's also got their fucking complicated.

2344
02:07:33,310 --> 02:07:36,520
It's too stressful to think about.
That shit is so fucking complicated,

2345
02:07:36,520 --> 02:07:39,130
isn't it? You're one of my movie
drops. I'll go get me an accountant.

2346
02:07:39,400 --> 02:07:42,780
When you move the drums, what are
you gonna do in the movie porn? Hmm.

2347
02:07:42,890 --> 02:07:45,340
First person does not worth any
money in porn anymore. Dude,

2348
02:07:45,580 --> 02:07:47,830
you gotta come up with another strategy
and that strategy would have been the

2349
02:07:47,831 --> 02:07:50,740
shit and 1993 you could
have been like Peter North.

2350
02:07:50,741 --> 02:07:54,100
Peter North drives a Ferrari and he
did gay porn. Yeah. How about that?

2351
02:07:55,030 --> 02:07:57,130
How about that? He's the only one
that got away with doing gay porn.

2352
02:07:57,370 --> 02:07:59,650
He did gay porn and they're like,
all right, don't do it again.

2353
02:07:59,890 --> 02:08:02,050
And then he came back and did
regular porn from then on out.

2354
02:08:02,240 --> 02:08:05,740
He did a little gay porn. I didn't believe
it. Like people told me, it was like,

2355
02:08:05,770 --> 02:08:09,760
no way. Not Peter man,
no way, dude. You know,

2356
02:08:09,820 --> 02:08:13,390
cause if you're going to have a porn
idle, that's the one that have, you know,

2357
02:08:13,540 --> 02:08:15,310
dude shoots these giant monster loads.

2358
02:08:15,490 --> 02:08:17,050
But then he'd go and
find some videos online.

2359
02:08:17,051 --> 02:08:20,700
It was a dude sucking his
cock and like, hey, hey, hey.

2360
02:08:20,710 --> 02:08:24,460
And this dude's bone in them in
the ass. Be like, hey, hey, hey.

2361
02:08:24,461 --> 02:08:29,320
And he tried to say there was like a body
double sun to ain't no CGI that good.

2362
02:08:29,760 --> 02:08:33,610
Talk about the hungry as butter ward. Can
we talk about that already? Yeah, we did.

2363
02:08:34,080 --> 02:08:37,490
I think we talked about it on stage
and time that you came on earth. Oh,

2364
02:08:37,491 --> 02:08:41,320
we didn't really, we talked about it
on the podcast. Yeah. Second time.

2365
02:08:41,560 --> 02:08:43,930
That is a crazy story.
Good story.

2366
02:08:43,931 --> 02:08:48,190
Is it good for the quick version of it?
Is that a friend of ours?

2367
02:08:48,450 --> 02:08:51,670
We won't say it. I wouldn't
do that. I think we do. A
friend of ours, no we didn't.

2368
02:08:51,870 --> 02:08:55,420
We never did. How dare you?
Friend of ours, uh, was uh,

2369
02:08:55,810 --> 02:08:59,860
running a small mixed martial
arts corporation and he found, um,

2370
02:09:00,370 --> 02:09:00,881
they did a,

2371
02:09:00,881 --> 02:09:04,090
an internet search on one
of their fighters and they
found out that he had won

2372
02:09:04,091 --> 02:09:07,400
the Hungary is but award and then they uh,

2373
02:09:07,450 --> 02:09:10,360
googled and there was no Google back then.
This is like the nineties.

2374
02:09:10,510 --> 02:09:14,290
And they found some online pictures of
him with two dudes treating him like

2375
02:09:14,320 --> 02:09:15,153
Chinese finger.

2376
02:09:17,080 --> 02:09:21,220
How many dicks in your ass do you have
to get to get that and that in a year to

2377
02:09:21,221 --> 02:09:22,360
get that award?

2378
02:09:22,510 --> 02:09:26,720
Like I think it's wrong weekend.

2379
02:09:27,160 --> 02:09:29,900
I'm thinking it's just what they
called a video to sell it. How much?

2380
02:09:29,930 --> 02:09:34,470
I don't think there was really like an
award show. No, I think he won like eight.

2381
02:09:35,020 --> 02:09:38,380
It was AVN, Hungary, his
butt or something. Like it
was the name of a video.

2382
02:09:38,410 --> 02:09:40,450
The hungry is butter wards
or something like that.

2383
02:09:41,140 --> 02:09:43,750
It wasn't an actual award that he
won? No. I mean it might look, look,

2384
02:09:43,810 --> 02:09:47,830
we could give out an award
for the hungriest butter. No.
Worst side. Brian wins it.

2385
02:09:47,831 --> 02:09:50,180
You know they are. You're
in the business. Hey,

2386
02:09:50,920 --> 02:09:54,040
do you know who the Helio
Gracie of gay porn is?

2387
02:09:54,040 --> 02:09:57,640
Like who is the master of get
like who just crushes everybody?

2388
02:09:57,641 --> 02:10:01,450
Who's the Kelly Slater of her guy?
Gay Porn for gay porn?

2389
02:10:01,451 --> 02:10:03,100
I don't know anything about it.
That must be,

2390
02:10:03,470 --> 02:10:07,690
it must be a Jenna Jamison of gay
porn, right? Master one more gay male,

2391
02:10:07,720 --> 02:10:09,740
male gay porn star.
We shouldn't even be googling this.

2392
02:10:09,741 --> 02:10:11,610
There's probably puts you on the list.
Yeah.

2393
02:10:13,030 --> 02:10:15,460
Male porn.

2394
02:10:15,730 --> 02:10:19,360
Is there a guide that just stands head
and shoulders above everyone else?

2395
02:10:19,780 --> 02:10:24,430
I don't know. I don't know.
Maybe a Twitter would know.
I bet if we asked Twitter,

2396
02:10:24,610 --> 02:10:25,443
dear Twitter,

2397
02:10:25,750 --> 02:10:29,800
what is the number one gay
male porn star in the world?

2398
02:10:29,950 --> 02:10:34,790
Is there a Michael Jordan? I read off the
first answer. Not. You don't think so? No.

2399
02:10:35,210 --> 02:10:38,210
I think there's so many. I
Dunno. I just don't think porn.

2400
02:10:38,330 --> 02:10:42,140
Some Lance Armstrong type motherfucker
that figures things out that other people

2401
02:10:42,141 --> 02:10:46,610
can't just rises to the top and becomes
famous at a genre where no one else is

2402
02:10:46,611 --> 02:10:51,270
getting famous gay gang. A gang bangs.
Like is there a dude who went to 50 oh,

2403
02:10:51,290 --> 02:10:55,580
the DP or triple p and the butthole.
Do they do that?

2404
02:10:56,440 --> 02:11:01,370
Can you were asking me? Okay. This guy
says, I only watch Steph Brent again,

2405
02:11:01,460 --> 02:11:06,410
or this is a woman rather ampers
and she says it's Brent Corrigan.

2406
02:11:06,411 --> 02:11:10,820
That might be her ex boyfriend.
Let's see. Oh yeah. My

2407
02:11:12,700 --> 02:11:17,110
passion. I like this fucking clown. I'm
going to, I'm going to get him on the,

2408
02:11:17,240 --> 02:11:19,670
on the Joe Rogan podcast. Okay. Let's see.

2409
02:11:19,880 --> 02:11:24,620
He's a male modern gay pornograph as
best known for his stage name. Hmm.

2410
02:11:24,800 --> 02:11:27,600
Yup. There he is. A little
fellow's already highlighted.

2411
02:11:27,610 --> 02:11:32,430
[inaudible] known for his
roles in schoolboy crush. Uh,

2412
02:11:32,890 --> 02:11:34,670
and Velvet Mafia.

2413
02:11:35,240 --> 02:11:39,650
He has won six Gay v n they have the,
gave Ian's et cetera.

2414
02:11:39,730 --> 02:11:44,730
Higgins Avn awards including best
bottom award two consecutive years.

2415
02:11:46,750 --> 02:11:50,460
The butthole, or are they just talking
about the shape of the butt? Um,

2416
02:11:50,540 --> 02:11:54,160
best bottom is you being on the
bottom, taken in the ass. Yeah.

2417
02:11:54,590 --> 02:11:57,560
It doesn't mean they wouldn't say
bottom instead of bought hall. You know,

2418
02:11:57,590 --> 02:11:59,930
Jesus Christ, they're, they're
pretty open about how they feel.

2419
02:12:00,440 --> 02:12:04,310
And I say I love his bottom.
No, they'd say is asshole.

2420
02:12:04,970 --> 02:12:09,430
What's the record for Gay Gang Bangs?
So is it,

2421
02:12:10,030 --> 02:12:14,360
what the fuck? Right. This guy's been a
lot of God damn movies. All right, let's,

2422
02:12:14,361 --> 02:12:18,510
let's find out what the number, uh, w what
would we, what would we say? Gay, Gay,

2423
02:12:19,710 --> 02:12:24,680
gay record. See,

2424
02:12:25,490 --> 02:12:29,270
Greece holds the record for
the biggest gay gang. Bang.

2425
02:12:29,550 --> 02:12:33,770
Grease the movie. No,
probably probably a dude.

2426
02:12:33,800 --> 02:12:36,170
This was 780 men.

2427
02:12:38,080 --> 02:12:41,720
Regular checks going nuts on ass suck.
Wow.

2428
02:12:41,810 --> 02:12:45,850
780 men but not one dude, right? Yeah.

2429
02:12:46,580 --> 02:12:48,560
There's one dude,

2430
02:12:48,740 --> 02:12:52,010
I believe they've got a crush women
because the women are doing like 50,

2431
02:12:52,011 --> 02:12:53,630
maybe a hundred is the rec side,

2432
02:12:54,050 --> 02:12:58,180
but guys don't stop the craziness that
are causing more durable that buttholes I

2433
02:12:58,181 --> 02:13:02,990
think that the problem is finding these
guys that get in line and film it.

2434
02:13:03,020 --> 02:13:06,470
Gay guys finding that would be hard
cause it's 10% of the population.

2435
02:13:06,471 --> 02:13:08,900
It'd be hard.
But if the numbers weren't a problem,

2436
02:13:08,901 --> 02:13:10,220
they're willing to ship people in.

2437
02:13:10,520 --> 02:13:14,300
I think guy gay porn would crush
regular pointing. Gangbang wow.

2438
02:13:14,301 --> 02:13:17,000
Listen to this though, man.
Listen to this shit. The most, uh,

2439
02:13:17,001 --> 02:13:22,001
Jackie Latori orgasms ever recorded in
one hour for a man is 1616 in one hour,

2440
02:13:24,120 --> 02:13:27,180
orgasms recording in one
hour for a man to die,

2441
02:13:27,320 --> 02:13:32,320
for the furthest a woman has ever been
recorded to ejaculate was nine feet 29

2442
02:13:33,931 --> 02:13:37,860
inches. Well, why would it be nine feet
29 and she scored 12 inches is a foot.

2443
02:13:38,100 --> 02:13:40,290
That's stupid.
That doesn't make any sense.

2444
02:13:41,160 --> 02:13:45,810
I came 16 times in an hour. Why
was it same? Nine feet, 29 inches.

2445
02:13:46,860 --> 02:13:51,450
Oh, it says three meters. Okay. Is that
three minutes is just nine feet, right,

2446
02:13:51,510 --> 02:13:55,080
isn't it? No, no. It's three feet
per meter, right? Roughly. Right.

2447
02:13:55,081 --> 02:13:58,620
So three meters is nine feet.
So why is it nine feet 29 inches?

2448
02:13:58,621 --> 02:14:00,990
That doesn't make any sense
of 12 inches is afoot anyway.

2449
02:14:01,110 --> 02:14:02,070
Whatever the fuck this says,

2450
02:14:02,280 --> 02:14:05,820
the greatest distance ever attained
for a jet of semen that has ever been

2451
02:14:05,821 --> 02:14:10,230
recorded is 18 feet.
Nine inches. That's huge.

2452
02:14:10,260 --> 02:14:14,640
Wow.
Why would it be Lexington Steel?

2453
02:14:14,940 --> 02:14:19,800
Horst? Schulze, that's the guy's name
that shot a load that went 18 feet in the,

2454
02:14:19,801 --> 02:14:24,330
in the, in the air. That's a
credible up, up in the air or across,

2455
02:14:25,300 --> 02:14:28,770
uh, what are the ways by distance?
It's gotta be a distance. No Way.

2456
02:14:28,771 --> 02:14:31,130
It could be straight up at 18 feet.
That's incorrect.

2457
02:14:31,140 --> 02:14:35,070
You as must have an arc to it. A Nice
Arc, like a McDonald's sign type thing.

2458
02:14:35,071 --> 02:14:39,600
Going on for 18 feet. Did they video
it? I don't know. They must say this.

2459
02:14:39,601 --> 02:14:43,230
I mean these are all world records. This
is the top 10 sex world records. It's on,

2460
02:14:43,231 --> 02:14:46,320
believe it or not,
the average speed of a man's loads.

2461
02:14:46,321 --> 02:14:50,430
What would you say your average speed,
your loads would be like 35 miles an hour.

2462
02:14:50,460 --> 02:14:53,370
What do you think Brian?
80 to 28 miles an hour.

2463
02:14:54,660 --> 02:14:58,920
28 miles an hour, so it's pretty close.
It's pretty close. If the car drove by,

2464
02:14:58,921 --> 02:15:01,800
you could tell the difference between
cargo in 28 miles an hour and 35 miles an

2465
02:15:01,801 --> 02:15:03,090
hour.
That's pretty fucking close.

2466
02:15:04,200 --> 02:15:07,470
Having swallowed the most amount
of semen ever officially recorded.

2467
02:15:07,620 --> 02:15:12,620
Michelle Monaghan had 1.7 pints of
semen pumped out of her stomach in Los

2468
02:15:14,250 --> 02:15:18,720
Angeles in July of 1991 it was that
pumped out by her ass. That'd be awesome,

2469
02:15:18,870 --> 02:15:23,010
dude. 1.7 pints, but maybe if she
had like a glass of coconut water.

2470
02:15:23,490 --> 02:15:27,210
C Two o very delicious right before
and it mixed in with the loads.

2471
02:15:27,450 --> 02:15:32,450
Maybe my increased the size
of the quantity of fluid
in her when she threw up.

2472
02:15:32,780 --> 02:15:37,410
Maybe she was throwing up loads and a
sprite. You don't know. Right, right.

2473
02:15:37,530 --> 02:15:40,440
What are they going to test it and make
sure it's a hundred percent loads? No,

2474
02:15:40,441 --> 02:15:43,200
they're just looked at it and a slice of
pizza. He wouldn't know the difference.

2475
02:15:43,201 --> 02:15:43,500
Yeah.

2476
02:15:43,500 --> 02:15:48,500
She just came into a big one of those
big glass baking measurement cups.

2477
02:15:49,290 --> 02:15:50,460
She just threw up in it.

2478
02:15:50,810 --> 02:15:55,810
There was 1.7 the fuck is this podcast
com female gang bang record is owned by a

2479
02:15:56,671 --> 02:15:59,790
woman named Houston who had intercourse.
It's 620 men.

2480
02:15:59,820 --> 02:16:04,030
I think that's been been by then.
This is some old guys. Yeah,

2481
02:16:04,380 --> 02:16:07,620
that's the old one. A lot. I don't
think it really is 600 men though.

2482
02:16:07,650 --> 02:16:11,010
I think what they do is they do is the
same guys and they keep rotating them.

2483
02:16:11,190 --> 02:16:14,970
Consider the idea that guy,
they like the common and they come back.

2484
02:16:16,270 --> 02:16:20,100
That's not the real records like who
made those records at Saint People? Me,

2485
02:16:20,340 --> 02:16:23,010
girl fucks two dudes and they
switch off a couple of times.

2486
02:16:23,011 --> 02:16:25,970
She can say she fucked 15 guys.
This doesn't even have gay.

2487
02:16:25,971 --> 02:16:29,770
It has a male gang bang male gangbang
world record goes to porn star.

2488
02:16:29,860 --> 02:16:34,860
John Doe who worked himself over 55
women and one day he had five to six

2489
02:16:35,171 --> 02:16:39,660
ejaculations. Hmm.
Pretty good. Well, yeah,

2490
02:16:39,670 --> 02:16:42,040
the checks.
Meanwhile that got committed suicide.

2491
02:16:42,940 --> 02:16:44,280
I got blew his fucking brains out.

2492
02:16:44,400 --> 02:16:47,760
I have so far Jack culation and see the
other day and then within an hour. Yeah,

2493
02:16:47,761 --> 02:16:51,030
but all of them were like
little teardrops. It's funny.

2494
02:16:51,031 --> 02:16:52,380
Most of them came from your eyes.

2495
02:16:52,410 --> 02:16:56,490
I lose the egg becomes really
thick and clumpy hatched.

2496
02:16:56,491 --> 02:16:59,790
Yet he counts it. When he
cries, I'm coming. Oh, kill me.

2497
02:16:59,880 --> 02:17:03,390
He was,
this was this masturbation

2498
02:17:05,180 --> 02:17:09,210
fucking real shot.
Now you weren't on that.

2499
02:17:09,211 --> 02:17:11,610
Now I just have a hot girlfriend
that makes me have boners all day.

2500
02:17:12,690 --> 02:17:15,770
Are you bragging bro? No, I'm just
saying that like literally I can have,

2501
02:17:15,990 --> 02:17:20,460
I can have sex nonstop all day. First
time in my life. What's that smell?

2502
02:17:20,640 --> 02:17:24,120
That's incredible. That's great. Do you
believe him? That's hard to believe.

2503
02:17:24,510 --> 02:17:25,720
I don't know anybody like that.

2504
02:17:27,120 --> 02:17:29,940
That's right. Again, it's
possible. It's all possible, dude.

2505
02:17:30,090 --> 02:17:33,420
If you were like some Super Alpha
Quinten Jackson looking mother Fucker,

2506
02:17:33,421 --> 02:17:37,010
I might buy it. I might believe it.
But maybe all your testosterone,

2507
02:17:37,011 --> 02:17:39,790
it's just stored up in your balls and
your buddy doesn't use any of it for

2508
02:17:39,791 --> 02:17:43,350
muscle development or you know,
behavior or any of that shit.

2509
02:17:43,500 --> 02:17:45,120
It's all just in your balls.
Ready to shoot.

2510
02:17:46,510 --> 02:17:50,550
I say two minutes to take like a
minute after I come. If I look at this,

2511
02:17:51,690 --> 02:17:55,040
boners comes right back to your fucking
pictures of your girlfriend away.

2512
02:17:55,050 --> 02:17:58,910
You're really making me sad. Seriously.
I never goes away. I just have like my,

2513
02:17:58,980 --> 02:18:02,220
for the, for the first time in my life,
my boner never goes down. I just can,

2514
02:18:02,221 --> 02:18:03,400
you know why you're saying this?
Cause you know his,

2515
02:18:03,401 --> 02:18:06,210
his ex girlfriend listens to the
podcast is just too much lie.

2516
02:18:06,510 --> 02:18:10,520
I swear to God it's not why Taylor was
Joey Diaz right now and do that to Taylor

2517
02:18:10,890 --> 02:18:12,260
vixen all diet guide.

2518
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:17,870
No, no, it's a different thing, right
Brian? Just difference. Love this time.

2519
02:18:18,410 --> 02:18:21,540
You never find doon doon doon too

2520
02:18:23,100 --> 02:18:27,530
fucking doing man tech guy.
Ah,

2521
02:18:27,560 --> 02:18:30,220
so hot room. Impressive man. I really am.

2522
02:18:30,920 --> 02:18:34,520
I just thought it was weird because I
never thought it was possible in my life.

2523
02:18:34,521 --> 02:18:38,330
Like I've always wondered how like
guys in porn do it and stuff like that.

2524
02:18:38,680 --> 02:18:42,200
Viagara when you drink. Some might
be because I've already said that.

2525
02:18:42,230 --> 02:18:43,070
I think she's like

2526
02:18:43,940 --> 02:18:46,040
get it in there and maybe she got
tired of you. Like remember you,

2527
02:18:46,041 --> 02:18:48,970
you say you would fall asleep because
you were too tired to go down on her and

2528
02:18:48,971 --> 02:18:50,920
then fall asleep because you
were too tired to do anything.

2529
02:18:50,921 --> 02:18:52,600
You do her and then you would fall asleep.

2530
02:18:53,380 --> 02:18:57,230
You talked about on the podcast, so
yes you did. My current girlfriend,

2531
02:18:58,530 --> 02:19:00,880
she said she was horny and you were
too tired to have sex with her.

2532
02:19:00,881 --> 02:19:03,420
She would go down now. That was
one time. That was one time.

2533
02:19:04,020 --> 02:19:07,330
One time. One time. Maybe that time
she's like, I'm tired of this shit.

2534
02:19:07,331 --> 02:19:10,570
I want to get fucked and so she started
crumpling up by Agra and I'm going to

2535
02:19:10,571 --> 02:19:11,590
cook for you tonight,
honey.

2536
02:19:11,980 --> 02:19:16,980
She made you a nice Viagara meatloaf in
like 2001 I got third row tickets to the

2537
02:19:17,771 --> 02:19:21,880
cure. I was so jazzed that was,
remember born again, that stripper.

2538
02:19:21,910 --> 02:19:24,660
Sure there's a long time
we were going in a true,

2539
02:19:24,670 --> 02:19:25,930
but that was a born again Christian.

2540
02:19:25,931 --> 02:19:27,980
So he would call her born again
that that was her nickname.

2541
02:19:27,980 --> 02:19:31,050
Born again. That's
hilarious. So anyways, uh,

2542
02:19:31,190 --> 02:19:32,990
she was only stripping
just to pay for school,

2543
02:19:32,991 --> 02:19:37,990
but she was like hardcore Christian
cause you're thinking of this.

2544
02:19:38,450 --> 02:19:43,040
But we were going to the
cure. So I'm like, I need
some ecstasy for this concert.

2545
02:19:43,220 --> 02:19:47,210
So I meet up with my buddy in the
afternoon to get some Mexican and I always

2546
02:19:47,211 --> 02:19:51,080
have bought vitamin bottles with me and
I put them into my vitamin bottles and I

2547
02:19:51,081 --> 02:19:54,600
go, when I eat, I'm going to take them
out of the vitamin bottle and you know,

2548
02:19:54,650 --> 02:19:59,300
eat and take my vitamins.
It's one o'clock. I go to El
Pollo Loco, we're sitting,

2549
02:19:59,301 --> 02:20:00,680
we're going to leave around seven.

2550
02:20:01,310 --> 02:20:06,290
I eat my chicken sitting there watching
TV and I just got really horny.

2551
02:20:06,291 --> 02:20:09,890
I just looked at him like, well,
fucking beast. Fuck this chick.

2552
02:20:10,130 --> 02:20:14,000
So I threw in the bed, I'm fucking
the shit out of her. And I'm like,

2553
02:20:14,030 --> 02:20:18,650
God damn. It feels like I'm
on ecstasy. And they go,

2554
02:20:19,970 --> 02:20:24,480
oh my God. I jumped off the bed
with open up my vitamin bottle.

2555
02:20:24,481 --> 02:20:25,600
Second Fuck,

2556
02:20:25,601 --> 02:20:30,601
are you fucking [inaudible] I forgot
to blow them out of my vitamins.

2557
02:20:31,550 --> 02:20:34,480
I didn't know I was on ecstasy until
right in the middle of sex. That's,

2558
02:20:34,780 --> 02:20:38,120
it was incredible sex. I'm like,
it's like I'm on email and it's just,

2559
02:20:38,960 --> 02:20:40,830
that's funny.
I flew eyes.

2560
02:20:41,540 --> 02:20:43,220
He supposed to kill your boner.

2561
02:20:43,310 --> 02:20:45,770
Didn't you say that you would
take Viagra and eat together

2562
02:20:46,030 --> 02:20:49,180
called after a while.
After a while it kills your bone,

2563
02:20:49,181 --> 02:20:51,430
but not in the beginning and the
beginning. You get really, really horny.

2564
02:20:51,431 --> 02:20:55,780
But if you want to go because when you're
on, yeah, well people are different. No,

2565
02:20:55,800 --> 02:20:58,450
no. People are different.
Like for me, if, if you know,

2566
02:20:58,480 --> 02:21:01,630
back in the days when every
now and then I pop a pill,

2567
02:21:01,780 --> 02:21:05,290
I would get a boner really quick. How many
times would have done he in your life?

2568
02:21:05,291 --> 02:21:10,050
How many times, man, back when
I was younger I probably did eat

2569
02:21:12,820 --> 02:21:13,780
maybe

2570
02:21:16,360 --> 02:21:21,120
40 times. Whoa. Oh Mike. Is that
a lot? That expensive? Lots of it.

2571
02:21:21,410 --> 02:21:26,100
It explains a lot. What do you
mean is it was, and I was like,

2572
02:21:26,320 --> 02:21:28,530
when I was younger,
this motherfucker's taking shit.

2573
02:21:28,531 --> 02:21:30,700
He doesn't even know what it is.
He's taking bath salts.

2574
02:21:32,250 --> 02:21:34,670
You gotta get your shit
from reputable sources.

2575
02:21:34,870 --> 02:21:38,800
You need to find some friendly person
that works at a club somewhere,

2576
02:21:38,830 --> 02:21:41,230
but excess is bad. Okay. I don't,

2577
02:21:42,010 --> 02:21:45,540
it kills your brain and for sure
does or ecstasy is not bad like MDM.

2578
02:21:45,541 --> 02:21:48,350
And the problem is, is that you
don't know what you're taking. Yeah.

2579
02:21:48,360 --> 02:21:52,050
Bass Hall boy shit. Exactly. That
stuff's supposed to be really tough.

2580
02:21:52,080 --> 02:21:53,920
If you've seen it, this,
this crocodile shit,

2581
02:21:54,100 --> 02:21:57,850
they shit that they're taking the Soviet
Union to shooting it up and it's making

2582
02:21:57,851 --> 02:21:58,810
your skin runaway.

2583
02:21:58,990 --> 02:22:01,270
There's all these photos of people
with their bones hanging off.

2584
02:22:01,450 --> 02:22:04,900
Literally your bones exposed when
were were wherever they shot it up.

2585
02:22:05,110 --> 02:22:08,700
Like their flesh has deteriorated to a
point where their bones are exposed. Yeah.

2586
02:22:08,800 --> 02:22:13,510
It's crazy to look at it, man. That's
gross. What a weird world we live in, man.

2587
02:22:13,690 --> 02:22:15,430
People will take some
drug that will make your,

2588
02:22:15,450 --> 02:22:17,380
your skin literally rot off your body.

2589
02:22:18,010 --> 02:22:21,850
People take some shit that they think
is ecstasy and it turns out to be some

2590
02:22:21,851 --> 02:22:26,130
weird fucking amphetamine that
somebody made in the lab. You know,

2591
02:22:26,160 --> 02:22:28,350
who knows what the fuck is going
to do to you and it's not the end.

2592
02:22:28,440 --> 02:22:30,150
They're gonna keep coming up with
more and more of these things.

2593
02:22:30,360 --> 02:22:33,330
Thinking about stuff off the dummies.
Yeah. These bath salts. That's you bro.

2594
02:22:33,331 --> 02:22:37,470
You took that shit. Does it, does that
scare you when you think of that? Ah,

2595
02:22:37,560 --> 02:22:39,420
that you could have taken
something really nutty? Yeah.

2596
02:22:40,080 --> 02:22:42,750
When you buy stuff like that, if you
biolink ACCC, doesn't that scare you?

2597
02:22:42,930 --> 02:22:44,760
Like you never know.
Like you might get it from some,

2598
02:22:44,761 --> 02:22:46,110
some dude that is scaring you.

2599
02:22:46,111 --> 02:22:48,990
Heard about this cocaine that's
making people's fucking flesh rot.

2600
02:22:49,280 --> 02:22:52,410
If you heard about this shit,
this is some cocaine is bad cocaine.

2601
02:22:52,411 --> 02:22:53,400
That's in California.

2602
02:22:53,401 --> 02:22:57,510
It's in New York and it's treated
with some livestock dewormer.

2603
02:22:57,570 --> 02:22:59,440
That's what they cut it with.
And you know,

2604
02:22:59,580 --> 02:23:01,290
let me look it up right now
because it's fucking crazy.

2605
02:23:01,291 --> 02:23:02,880
And people you probably hear,
yeah,

2606
02:23:07,420 --> 02:23:07,920
okay.

2607
02:23:07,920 --> 02:23:11,670
Yeah, yeah. It's um, cocaine,
bad cocaine in Los Angeles,

2608
02:23:11,671 --> 02:23:14,490
in New York City tainted with a,
some sort of a,

2609
02:23:14,491 --> 02:23:18,890
I'm hearing this a livestock
dewormer yeah, it's really fucked up.

2610
02:23:18,910 --> 02:23:22,700
What happens when you do it? They, they're
getting, they're getting really bad. Um,

2611
02:23:22,800 --> 02:23:26,850
uh, noses, ears and cheeks develop
ugly purple swatches of dead skin.

2612
02:23:28,870 --> 02:23:33,730
This is like d, it's, it's called
Lavana soul. That's the stuff.

2613
02:23:33,880 --> 02:23:35,420
And the dealers are
cutting it with this shit.

2614
02:23:35,421 --> 02:23:38,410
And they say like 90% of the cocaine
in New York and California is,

2615
02:23:38,680 --> 02:23:40,960
is contaminated with, is this, this shit?

2616
02:23:41,740 --> 02:23:44,710
90% of the cocaine and cow,
excuse me,

2617
02:23:44,711 --> 02:23:48,250
70% of the u s department of Justice
is reporting this. Okay. By the way,

2618
02:23:48,251 --> 02:23:49,780
this is just the u s
department of Justice.

2619
02:23:49,990 --> 02:23:52,090
They might just be saying this
to cut out the cocaine business.

2620
02:23:52,540 --> 02:23:56,440
They're saying up to 70% of the cocaine
in the u s is contaminated with this

2621
02:23:56,570 --> 02:23:57,970
love van,
Mother's soul,

2622
02:23:58,090 --> 02:24:02,800
which is cheap and widely available and
commonly used for deworming livestock.

2623
02:24:04,190 --> 02:24:08,840
Whoa. What the fuck man?
What are they doing?

2624
02:24:10,820 --> 02:24:13,550
You would think that debt would be
something that someone who hates cocaine

2625
02:24:13,551 --> 02:24:14,384
users would do.

2626
02:24:14,450 --> 02:24:17,000
You would think that that would be
someone who actually wants to stop people

2627
02:24:17,001 --> 02:24:18,590
from using cocaine.
Would you know?

2628
02:24:18,591 --> 02:24:21,860
They would like mix it in there so
that people would stop coming back.

2629
02:24:22,010 --> 02:24:22,843
You know what I'm saying?

2630
02:24:23,030 --> 02:24:25,970
Like why would you do that if you're
trying to sell more cocaine then almost

2631
02:24:25,971 --> 02:24:28,500
seems like something like the
government would do ma'am.

2632
02:24:29,190 --> 02:24:31,910
Like the whole story's probably fake
and they're just putting it out there to

2633
02:24:31,911 --> 02:24:35,270
scare you. Like people are on Pirate Bay,
like, oh there's a buyers in this file.

2634
02:24:35,370 --> 02:24:37,520
I Dunno, maybe, but it's on La la weekly.

2635
02:24:38,470 --> 02:24:41,570
It seems like they would do their
due diligence, don't you think? Yeah,

2636
02:24:41,690 --> 02:24:46,590
I like Waco. Don't you think? Yeah, you
fell asleep on me. You mother fucker. No,

2637
02:24:46,591 --> 02:24:49,950
I'm just thinking about your girlfriend
said, Elliot, what do you think getting,

2638
02:24:49,951 --> 02:24:51,930
do you think that they would do this?
Who the fuck would do this?

2639
02:24:51,931 --> 02:24:53,100
Do you think this is the government?

2640
02:24:55,100 --> 02:24:55,933
Who knows?

2641
02:24:56,150 --> 02:24:58,820
Do you see the UFO videos over London? Do
you believe in those? Did you see that?

2642
02:24:59,060 --> 02:25:02,730
I saw w what does that look like to,
I just,

2643
02:25:02,840 --> 02:25:06,680
there's so many videos like that dude
looks like Cgi to me. It's too convenient,

2644
02:25:06,710 --> 02:25:08,450
the whole,
the way it's set up as two convenient.

2645
02:25:09,050 --> 02:25:11,780
There's a bunch of people standing there
looking up and everybody's looking up

2646
02:25:11,781 --> 02:25:14,540
at night. They're catching these things
and they fly in and out of the clouds.

2647
02:25:14,660 --> 02:25:17,070
I've seen it, but you know what
really makes me think that it's,

2648
02:25:17,100 --> 02:25:20,690
it's a two convenient. The
guy film looks up, films,

2649
02:25:20,691 --> 02:25:24,370
some of the Ufos and then looks
down all these people watching,

2650
02:25:24,520 --> 02:25:27,880
which is the fucking last thing that
you would do if you actually thought you

2651
02:25:27,881 --> 02:25:29,950
saw a real Ufo is flying through the air.

2652
02:25:30,160 --> 02:25:32,080
You would keep the fucking camera on them.

2653
02:25:32,260 --> 02:25:36,310
You wouldn't want to turn it point down
it all these people watching. Maybe.

2654
02:25:36,320 --> 02:25:39,430
Maybe you don't know what the hell it is
and like look, everyone's tripping out.

2655
02:25:39,460 --> 02:25:42,760
You know he showed that before you showed
everybody looking up at the sky and

2656
02:25:42,761 --> 02:25:46,390
then he catches this actors.
Yeah, I think it's fake.

2657
02:25:46,510 --> 02:25:48,880
People get a kick out of doing shit
like that. They think it's cute.

2658
02:25:49,360 --> 02:25:51,040
So much fake shit on the Internet now.

2659
02:25:51,340 --> 02:25:52,870
That's one of the fun
things about the Internet.

2660
02:25:52,871 --> 02:25:56,110
Trying to figure out what's
fake and what's not. Brian's
the master at that Shit.

2661
02:25:56,111 --> 02:25:59,950
He calls fakes. He calls fix better
than anybody but sometimes he's off.

2662
02:26:00,160 --> 02:26:03,520
Sometimes it's just sound sync
problems and it looks fake.

2663
02:26:04,330 --> 02:26:06,760
Look at this cocaine shit like
we was doing these people.

2664
02:26:07,790 --> 02:26:09,030
It's making their skin right off.

2665
02:26:09,510 --> 02:26:12,730
Its like making that year turn
like blue on black hair skin.

2666
02:26:12,780 --> 02:26:17,570
Your skin's fucking farm
cocaine. Yup. Oh my God. Yeah.

2667
02:26:17,710 --> 02:26:20,340
There's some people have suffered
permanent scarring on their body from this

2668
02:26:20,341 --> 02:26:23,770
shit. You know what got
the good shit. No fall off.

2669
02:26:24,940 --> 02:26:28,880
This message brought to you by
prescription pills. What is that shit?

2670
02:26:28,930 --> 02:26:32,840
What's it called? It's
called love van muscle. Yeah.

2671
02:26:33,400 --> 02:26:37,300
L. E. V. A. M. I. S. O. L. E. Van Assault.

2672
02:26:37,390 --> 02:26:40,060
It's bad for your kids.
And on that note,

2673
02:26:40,061 --> 02:26:43,200
I think this fucking podcast started off
real strong and then someone other than

2674
02:26:43,201 --> 02:26:44,110
we,
we lost the last team

2675
02:26:44,210 --> 02:26:47,930
we got into gay porn.
It was my fault.

2676
02:26:48,380 --> 02:26:50,810
We got into gay porn and Brian started
reminiscing about his girlfriend

2677
02:26:51,950 --> 02:26:56,770
looking at pictures. Oh.
Um, tomorrow, somebody,

2678
02:26:56,800 --> 02:27:00,070
I'm not sure, somebody will be
on the podcast. The guy from, um,

2679
02:27:00,310 --> 02:27:05,110
ancient aliens is coming on the podcast
and he's coming on at the end of July.

2680
02:27:05,111 --> 02:27:07,480
It will be July 27.
And um,

2681
02:27:07,720 --> 02:27:12,400
his name is Giorgio and it's
just a tough one to pronounce.

2682
02:27:13,030 --> 02:27:17,500
T. S. O. U. K. A. L. O. S.

2683
02:27:17,560 --> 02:27:22,150
I think the is silent. Yeah.
Soup. Gallows, sucralose,

2684
02:27:22,540 --> 02:27:24,280
sucralose,
Giorgio sucralose.

2685
02:27:24,430 --> 02:27:27,290
And he's the guy from ancient
aliens with the crazy hair who's a,

2686
02:27:27,430 --> 02:27:29,800
a self professed wacky,
alien, loving bastard.

2687
02:27:30,010 --> 02:27:32,140
Cause that's what I called them
and said yes. Guilty as charged.

2688
02:27:32,770 --> 02:27:34,800
He's cool as fuck.
I like him and I'm,

2689
02:27:34,801 --> 02:27:37,060
I'm excited to have mom because we're
going to talk about some weird shit.

2690
02:27:37,061 --> 02:27:39,940
You should probably be on that one,
man. I would love to ask a question.

2691
02:27:40,240 --> 02:27:43,540
You should probably be in on that one.
That would be a fun conversation. Yeah.

2692
02:27:43,541 --> 02:27:45,840
We might have to bring you in on that one.
I have to bring Eddie,

2693
02:27:45,900 --> 02:27:48,790
Eddie Bravo and with the the
alien dude. Be honored. Yeah,

2694
02:27:48,791 --> 02:27:51,980
because no one loves the aliens more
than you and him. You and him together.

2695
02:27:51,981 --> 02:27:54,980
It would be a fucking, we fucked
people. I tsunami of aliens.

2696
02:27:57,360 --> 02:27:59,860
Don't you have like aliens all
over your logos and your shirt?

2697
02:28:00,560 --> 02:28:04,350
Just don't necessarily believe
in them. I do my logos. Well,

2698
02:28:04,351 --> 02:28:08,880
my whole logo is an alien. If I'm down.

2699
02:28:09,000 --> 02:28:14,000
I love a love Ufo DVDs and
I do short 200 of them,

2700
02:28:15,330 --> 02:28:18,510
but that's why I don't believe in them.
I seen so much stuff.

2701
02:28:18,511 --> 02:28:20,370
I think the way I look at it,
and this is not,

2702
02:28:20,371 --> 02:28:22,040
not that I don't in them because it's not

2703
02:28:22,040 --> 02:28:25,820
that I don't believe in them. I don't
not believe, I don't believe you are.

2704
02:28:25,821 --> 02:28:28,940
Foes don't exist. I don't believe
that my, in my mind is open about it,

2705
02:28:28,941 --> 02:28:31,880
but I'm not convinced either way.
But the way I look at it,

2706
02:28:31,910 --> 02:28:35,720
it's like everyone's got a goddamn camera
with a f on their phone. Everyone does.

2707
02:28:35,721 --> 02:28:39,590
Now you would think that if there,
if I meet a thousand people, okay,

2708
02:28:39,591 --> 02:28:43,610
out of every thousand people that I meet,
at least 10 of them are fucking morons.

2709
02:28:43,840 --> 02:28:45,920
Like extreme morons,
right?

2710
02:28:45,921 --> 02:28:48,950
If you meet a thousand when you
say 10 or just complete idiots,

2711
02:28:49,310 --> 02:28:53,930
pathological liars completely fucked
up, right? It a good solid 10 right?

2712
02:28:54,230 --> 02:28:59,230
So I would think that if there's that
many people that are idiots and fucked up,

2713
02:28:59,241 --> 02:29:02,840
and then you look at the number of Ufo
stories, like what are the numbers?

2714
02:29:02,841 --> 02:29:06,590
The numbers like are similar to what
you would expect from a population of

2715
02:29:06,591 --> 02:29:09,500
retards.
I got a small population and dominant.

2716
02:29:09,660 --> 02:29:12,260
You look at the smartest people on
the opposite end of the spectrum.

2717
02:29:13,850 --> 02:29:17,240
Wernher von Braun and Hermann Oberth.
There were rocket scientists.

2718
02:29:17,270 --> 02:29:19,220
They not only believe in aliens,

2719
02:29:19,250 --> 02:29:23,750
they're saying our technology
came from messages from pea beans,

2720
02:29:23,751 --> 02:29:25,820
from other solar system. That's
what they're saying. Yeah.

2721
02:29:25,821 --> 02:29:29,210
I would have to talk to them. I
believe that. I believe that quote go,

2722
02:29:29,240 --> 02:29:31,290
go Wernher von Braun.
Well,

2723
02:29:31,940 --> 02:29:32,810
uh,

2724
02:29:34,380 --> 02:29:37,650
uh,
beans from Ufo beans from other worlds.

2725
02:29:38,040 --> 02:29:42,030
His exact quote is beans from other
worlds helped us. I've seen that.

2726
02:29:42,031 --> 02:29:45,060
I've seen that written, but who knows what
that really is what he said. You know,

2727
02:29:45,061 --> 02:29:49,080
it's so hard when the dude's dead
and he died in 1977. You know,

2728
02:29:49,081 --> 02:29:52,170
who the fuck knows what he
actually said? You know? Well,

2729
02:29:52,171 --> 02:29:56,370
you know that he's quoted as saying
it, so maybe that's, yeah, maybe,

2730
02:29:56,430 --> 02:30:00,510
but yeah, two different
guys. No, I think, look,

2731
02:30:00,530 --> 02:30:04,110
it is entirely possible if it's proven
that the quote was actually legit,

2732
02:30:04,140 --> 02:30:07,930
like yes, here's the video of
him actually saying then what,

2733
02:30:07,931 --> 02:30:12,900
what happens at that point? That's,
that's pretty convincing evidence. Maybe.

2734
02:30:12,960 --> 02:30:16,680
Or He may be, he's a troll. Maybe
Wernher von Braun was a big Nazi troll.

2735
02:30:17,670 --> 02:30:18,270
I mean,

2736
02:30:18,270 --> 02:30:22,290
the thing about Wernher von Braun is
he was the head of Nazi of NASA rather.

2737
02:30:22,291 --> 02:30:25,350
But he was a confirmed Nazi and
the Simon Wiesenthal Center said,

2738
02:30:25,351 --> 02:30:26,580
if that guy was alive today,

2739
02:30:26,700 --> 02:30:30,420
they would prosecute him for crimes
against humanity. So who the fuck knows?

2740
02:30:30,450 --> 02:30:35,430
He could have been trolling, but I don't,
I don't believe that it's impossible.

2741
02:30:35,460 --> 02:30:38,760
It's definitely possible. So I'm looking
forward to having this Giorgio dude on.

2742
02:30:38,790 --> 02:30:41,760
It should be a fascinating conversation.
I want to find out how his brain works,

2743
02:30:41,761 --> 02:30:45,280
man. You know, because he said, he says a
lot of crazy stuff. I want to know. Yeah.

2744
02:30:45,290 --> 02:30:49,740
He seems like I almost like it could be
a character, may be a little bit, maybe.

2745
02:30:49,741 --> 02:30:53,430
Maybe it's fun, you know, maybe some of
it's sexy. I mean, he runs x. He, yeah,

2746
02:30:53,431 --> 02:30:55,800
it's sexy. It's sexy to believe
in bigfoot. Right. You know,

2747
02:30:56,190 --> 02:30:59,070
it's sexy to believe in aliens.
It's sexy to believe in all that shit.

2748
02:30:59,100 --> 02:31:01,620
It's interesting. Who the fuck
knows? But that's coming up.

2749
02:31:01,621 --> 02:31:04,650
I don't know who's going to
be on tomorrow, but we'll
get somebody. Uh, and then,

2750
02:31:04,651 --> 02:31:07,440
um, maybe Thursday's going to be
my friend, young urban, you know,

2751
02:31:07,441 --> 02:31:11,540
young dude who wrote all the
books on, um, on mushrooms and,

2752
02:31:11,541 --> 02:31:15,000
and religion. The problem is he's got
the flu and I don't want the fucking flu.

2753
02:31:15,020 --> 02:31:17,080
Yeah. Let's give him a couple
of weeks. Yeah. I might,

2754
02:31:17,110 --> 02:31:20,370
I might have the guy that he's the guy
that turned you to Terence Mckenna. Yeah,

2755
02:31:20,371 --> 02:31:23,760
he turned me on to a lot of things.
Uh, he's uh, he's a fascinating cat.

2756
02:31:23,761 --> 02:31:25,810
He's a real, real odd duck. And uh,

2757
02:31:25,830 --> 02:31:29,170
he's written two books now on
psychedelics and religion one,

2758
02:31:29,180 --> 02:31:31,920
and he was with us when we first did.
Damn t he was with us when we,

2759
02:31:31,921 --> 02:31:36,090
you had that crazy bad trip. The
first one was horrible. Yeah.

2760
02:31:36,120 --> 02:31:38,520
It was pretty bad.
Screaming and gallon screaming.

2761
02:31:38,600 --> 02:31:42,390
Well Eddie fucked up and he ate food
right before he went on his trip,

2762
02:31:42,391 --> 02:31:43,620
which you're never supposed to do.

2763
02:31:43,800 --> 02:31:45,870
You're not supposed to have anything
in your stomach when you go on the trip

2764
02:31:45,871 --> 02:31:47,790
because your body, you
know, kind of freaks out.

2765
02:31:48,000 --> 02:31:52,530
So he in the middle of this trip gets up
and I have to help him get to sink and

2766
02:31:52,531 --> 02:31:55,400
he threw up in the sink. You,
you hurled in this sense,

2767
02:31:55,401 --> 02:31:58,180
just throw up all over the floor. No,
no, no, no. You made it to the sink.

2768
02:31:58,230 --> 02:32:01,470
You manage the sink. You don't even
remember the story that could, right.

2769
02:32:01,471 --> 02:32:04,460
It's probably [inaudible].
I just don't remember exactly.

2770
02:32:04,480 --> 02:32:06,570
It was ed per Gail the whole
time too. I was like, wow,

2771
02:32:06,571 --> 02:32:07,770
just hanging out with ed brick gal,

2772
02:32:07,771 --> 02:32:11,490
because when whoever wrote this whole
story on your message board didn't put

2773
02:32:11,491 --> 02:32:13,880
Eddie Bravo.
That was John.

2774
02:32:14,080 --> 02:32:16,580
John Changed the names of everything
and I thought it was ed per gallon.

2775
02:32:16,930 --> 02:32:19,620
It was a Johnny rotten,
I think it was Johnny rotten.

2776
02:32:19,621 --> 02:32:23,100
Maybe I was either Yana Johnny rotten
changed the names of everything sink and

2777
02:32:23,101 --> 02:32:25,760
your little bar, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah. That's what he threw up. Yeah.

2778
02:32:25,770 --> 02:32:28,770
You heard, I looked up at you and
I remember because I was screaming,

2779
02:32:28,830 --> 02:32:31,950
I was screaming and I looked up
at you and I'm like, all right,

2780
02:32:31,951 --> 02:32:34,350
don't worry about me. And then like
that was like me letting you know,

2781
02:32:34,620 --> 02:32:38,220
just let me fucking throw up,
scream, I'm going to be fine. Well,

2782
02:32:38,221 --> 02:32:40,170
the thing about bad trips is the real,

2783
02:32:40,171 --> 02:32:42,810
real bad trips happen when you're
trying to control the experience.

2784
02:32:43,150 --> 02:32:47,050
Like the whole idea is to just let go
and let this journey happened and you got

2785
02:32:47,060 --> 02:32:48,900
to,
you got to trust in the psychedelic,

2786
02:32:48,901 --> 02:32:51,950
but you are fighting it tooth
and claw and it was all going on.

2787
02:32:52,060 --> 02:32:56,280
That first time was a disaster.
Shazamm this Friday night,

2788
02:32:56,520 --> 02:33:01,320
July 1st we will all be in Las Vegas,
Brian included. So if you want a hug,

2789
02:33:01,321 --> 02:33:02,730
Brian,
come on down.

2790
02:33:02,820 --> 02:33:06,270
We met this dude who had a fucking
death squad tattoo your little logo.

2791
02:33:06,450 --> 02:33:09,630
This guy had an sat too. Just four
people now with it. That's crazy.

2792
02:33:09,631 --> 02:33:11,730
And there's a few that have
the higher primary tattoos too.

2793
02:33:11,950 --> 02:33:14,120
And there's a bunch of time. I hate
10 plan planet tattoos are there now.

2794
02:33:16,020 --> 02:33:18,640
We causing people to get ink
on their scandalous skin. No,

2795
02:33:18,641 --> 02:33:22,740
we're not tattoos off of that
and making it prettier. Uh,

2796
02:33:22,770 --> 02:33:26,040
this Friday night we will all be at
Mandalay bay. It's going to be Joey Diaz.

2797
02:33:26,041 --> 02:33:28,500
Ari should fear me and Doug
Benson is going to stop by.

2798
02:33:28,501 --> 02:33:31,380
He's going to do a guest
set and um, um, Brian,

2799
02:33:31,381 --> 02:33:33,510
if we get them drunk and off from my,
push him in front of the microphone,

2800
02:33:33,690 --> 02:33:35,370
I'm going to push you on at the end,
the very end.

2801
02:33:35,371 --> 02:33:37,980
You're going to come out and talk
to the crowd, do some Q and a,

2802
02:33:38,340 --> 02:33:40,910
some Q and a when you're on acid.
Um,

2803
02:33:40,911 --> 02:33:45,911

weekend we are in Irvine at the Irvine

2805
02:33:51,220 --> 02:33:54,390

2818
02:34:38,380 --> 02:34:41,320
I think Ella. I don't know too much
about it because who's organized it?

2819
02:34:41,530 --> 02:34:44,680
Donna and Amy from legends.
They put it all together.

Well there's a lot of people
are bringing their wives.

2823
02:34:51,780 --> 02:34:56,380
Actually a lot of people are bringing
their wives. Yes. Still 50 guys.

2824
02:34:56,590 --> 02:35:01,120
So that's next Monday you could, I'm

That's going to be fun, man.

2828
02:35:10,180 --> 02:35:11,800
You scared that anybody might freak out,

2829
02:35:11,801 --> 02:35:14,020
that someone tapped some money and
then they just throw him overboard.

2830
02:35:14,520 --> 02:35:17,020
Can you imagine being on that cruise
with like your wife? Like, Hey,

Hello?
