1
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:05,470
We have two commercials that we do smell
good.

2
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:08,670
I don't.
I don't know how to use windows.

3
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:12,000
Little Jimmy.
We just switched over to windows.

4
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:17,210
We just started using these alien ware 
computers because a alienware sponsors a

5
00:00:18,001 --> 00:00:20,490
lot of MMA fighter,
so I thought it would be a good thing to

6
00:00:20,491 --> 00:00:24,480
do to support them.
They sponsor a lot of good guys like Pat

7
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,170
Barry and all these guys,
so we just switched over these alienware

8
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:28,560
computers.
Look at this fucking thing.

9
00:00:28,561 --> 00:00:31,140
This is like a folding Imac.
It's a beast,

10
00:00:31,141 --> 00:00:32,220
man.
It's ridiculous.

11
00:00:32,221 --> 00:00:33,420
It's so big.
It's.

12
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:37,110
It's fucking unbelievable.
It's if you're really into games,

13
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:42,380
it's like plant.
You can go on the road and take this 

14
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:42,380
with.
You have your.

15
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:44,660
You're like one of those maniac gaming 
people that just loves to like,

16
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:49,870
oh I know dudes who go on the road and 
they do their gigs and then they bring 

17
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:52,170
their laptops back to the hotel and they
play games all night and they'll just.

18
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:57,260
That's what they do everywhere.
Don't they want like a lot of guys like 

19
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:59,090
Kevin Hart and those guys want like 
video games in their dressing room.

20
00:00:59,091 --> 00:01:00,670
Does he,
well,

21
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:05,730
I think maybe some guys you use games to
like take their mind off of the show to 

22
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:06,650
like unwind a little bit.
Maybe.

23
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:07,920
Maybe you know,
if you.

24
00:01:07,921 --> 00:01:09,540
I mean in the dressing room I would 
think,

25
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:10,900
oh,
I want an address.

26
00:01:10,901 --> 00:01:14,070
For him it was like water and beer,
but what else do you need?

27
00:01:14,071 --> 00:01:16,650
Maybe some principals.
Coffee.

28
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,170
Yeah,
but like video games.

29
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,160
Like is it really.
I'm too busy panicking for a show,

30
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:23,630
man.
I'm,

31
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,270
I'm the worst.
Like A.

32
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:28,740
I always think it's going to go poorly.
I never think I'm going to do good.

33
00:01:28,741 --> 00:01:31,230
I'm just terrible.
I'm not a professional.

34
00:01:31,231 --> 00:01:33,460
Like I start calling up my act,
going that shit car.

35
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:35,430
I'm really psyched myself out.

36
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:37,230
That's a terrible thing to do.
I know,

37
00:01:37,231 --> 00:01:37,850
I know,
man.

38
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:39,630
I got to stop that shit.
After 22 years,

39
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:41,670
the show's brought to you by the 
flashlight.

40
00:01:41,671 --> 00:01:46,671
If you go to Joe Rogan.net
and click on the link for the 

41
00:01:46,671 --> 00:01:46,671
fleshlight,
entering the code name.

42
00:01:46,671 --> 00:01:50,341
Rogan.
Save yourself 15 percent off the number 

43
00:01:50,341 --> 00:01:50,640
one sex toy for men.
Jimmy,

44
00:01:50,641 --> 00:01:52,050
have you ever used one of those 
flashlights?

45
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,640
No,
but I hear they're pretty amazing.

46
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:55,110
Really.
You never use what I'm telling you,

47
00:01:55,111 --> 00:01:56,370
man.
I know you masturbate.

48
00:01:56,371 --> 00:01:57,930
We all do.
But uh,

49
00:01:57,931 --> 00:02:02,931
and I still do on occasion.
I still sometimes I don't use the 

50
00:02:02,931 --> 00:02:02,970
flashlight,
but it's way better than beating off.

51
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:03,790
It is,
right?

52
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:05,280
You put lube on it.
Yeah,

53
00:02:05,281 --> 00:02:05,760
yeah,
yeah.

54
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:07,380
You Lube it up.
It's incredible.

55
00:02:07,381 --> 00:02:09,510
It's like it's like a spectacular 
vagina.

56
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:12,270
Not like a,
not like a decent one.

57
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:15,480
R One from a crow's.
Been fingered a few too many times.

58
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:17,970
Like a nice snug.
Oh,

59
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:19,440
so fuck it.
Like a warm,

60
00:02:19,441 --> 00:02:20,760
friendly,
excited,

61
00:02:20,761 --> 00:02:23,490
snug vagina can.
When you say fantastic vagina,

62
00:02:23,491 --> 00:02:26,200
I just think that means there's no 
fucking Larynix attached to the person.

63
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:32,970
Snug Vagina were also brought to you by 
[inaudible] dot com.

64
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:33,660
That's.
Oh,

65
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:35,670
and it makers of Alpha,
brain,

66
00:02:35,671 --> 00:02:36,690
troon,
tech sport,

67
00:02:36,691 --> 00:02:39,630
True Tech.
Immune and new mood.

68
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,690
And if you have interest in any of this 
stuff,

69
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,720
what they are as new tropics.
Most of them except for a couple of them

70
00:02:45,721 --> 00:02:50,721
are a more sports us a performance like 
I'm shroom tech sport,

71
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:53,820
which is an amazing supplement for 
energy and endurance.

72
00:02:53,821 --> 00:02:57,960
I take five of them before I do Jujitsu.
That's my thing.

73
00:02:58,110 --> 00:02:59,680
Yeah,
it's fucking incredible.

74
00:02:59,681 --> 00:03:01,010
It gives you amazing energy,
man.

75
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:01,620
Like,
oh look,

76
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:04,000
it's got a lot of vitamin B,
12 in it,

77
00:03:04,001 --> 00:03:09,001
and this quarter's eps mushrooms,
which is a mushroom that these people 

78
00:03:09,001 --> 00:03:12,880
like high altitudes founded.
The cattle were eating and it was making

79
00:03:12,881 --> 00:03:16,300
them more active so people started 
supplementing their diet with it.

80
00:03:16,301 --> 00:03:19,870
And this mushroom apparently helps you 
process oxygen.

81
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:20,380
Do you know what I'm saying?

82
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:23,110
He's tired.
I'm always tired.

83
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:24,340
Well,
that sleep apnea thing,

84
00:03:24,341 --> 00:03:29,341
have you got that workout?
I know I got like the thing you 

85
00:03:29,341 --> 00:03:29,341
suggested,
the mouth guard and helps,

86
00:03:29,341 --> 00:03:32,140
but I may have central sleep apnea,
which is when your brain just is fucking

87
00:03:32,141 --> 00:03:35,620
forgets to send the signal and uh,
so I might need the,

88
00:03:35,621 --> 00:03:37,390
uh,
you and get the machine,

89
00:03:37,391 --> 00:03:39,010
but I can't use it.
I just can't do it.

90
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,690
Like I slept for like nine hours last 
night.

91
00:03:40,691 --> 00:03:45,691
I'm just exhausted.
But maybe I think I might have maybe 

92
00:03:45,691 --> 00:03:45,691
have a deficiency somewhere.
A beach while I've been thinking about.

93
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:48,700
Well,
I think most people don't get the proper

94
00:03:48,701 --> 00:03:51,580
amount of vitamins from their diet.
It would be nice if we did.

95
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:56,760
I mean,
ideally you would not want to take 

96
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:56,760
supplements,
you know,

97
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:56,760
except uh,
you know,

98
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:01,940
I guess you would want to maybe to maybe
take nootropics or maybe take like for 

99
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:03,420
some things,
like if you wanted to like a lot of B,

100
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:08,450
12,
you're not really gonna get the kind of 

101
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:09,090
volume in an injectable b 12 or you 
know,

102
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:11,500
even though an oral [inaudible] from 
your diet,

103
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:13,780
like you'd have to eat like a lot of 
food to get it.

104
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:14,540
It's,
it's,

105
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:19,780
it's really.
And I think be 12 comes from animal 

106
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:19,780
protein to.
If I don't,

107
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:21,580
I might be wrong about that.
Is it okay to get it injected?

108
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:22,930
I might've made that up.
I should google it,

109
00:04:22,931 --> 00:04:24,910
but I don't know how to use this.
I know a lot of people are doing.

110
00:04:24,911 --> 00:04:25,880
I've heard that too.
Yes.

111
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:26,620
Yeah,
yeah,

112
00:04:26,621 --> 00:04:27,370
sure.
It's okay.

113
00:04:27,371 --> 00:04:28,840
Yeah,
it's not poison.

114
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:29,650
I mean,
you're not,

115
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:32,260
you're not injecting toxic amounts of 
it.

116
00:04:32,261 --> 00:04:34,360
There's certain vitamins where you have 
to be careful.

117
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:35,180
Um,
the,

118
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:35,960
the,
you know,

119
00:04:35,961 --> 00:04:36,520
there's,
there's,

120
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:39,460
there's vitamins that are absorbed in 
different ways by the body.

121
00:04:39,461 --> 00:04:41,710
I don't remember which one I think is 
tricky.

122
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:46,890
I think if you get too much a,
but we are talking about like monstrous 

123
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:50,341
amounts of the vitamins I had.
So as long as you're taking like 

124
00:04:50,341 --> 00:04:51,520
standard Multivitamin,
most that's been worked out a good solid

125
00:04:51,521 --> 00:04:52,300
multivitamin.

126
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:55,270
They told me that I needed more whatever
the sun is.

127
00:04:55,271 --> 00:04:58,270
D is that D,
which is crazy because I live in la.

128
00:04:58,271 --> 00:05:00,610
Just to show you that's not really 
outside though,

129
00:05:00,611 --> 00:05:01,820
you know,
like chilling outside.

130
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:06,390
Let's go outside it more than I mean 
normal like I don't not go outside.

131
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:11,430
Not like you would if you lived in like 
the Caribbean or some shit all the time.

132
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:16,560
I mean an outside in Ohio people would 
go to the sun in Ohio so it makes no 

133
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,131
sense.
Like is there something that makes you 

134
00:05:20,131 --> 00:05:21,280
say you don't keep the DNA,
you like that you know,

135
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:23,710
there's a lot of people that have 
deficiencies.

136
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:24,490
You,
you know,

137
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:25,930
your diet man.
I mean,

138
00:05:25,931 --> 00:05:30,931
I don't know what you're eating,
but I don't think you're like super 

139
00:05:30,931 --> 00:05:31,270
careful about your diet.
Right east.

140
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:36,520
The reality is the reality is most of 
our diets,

141
00:05:36,521 --> 00:05:39,280
if you just look at what you're eating,
you're missing a lot of shit.

142
00:05:39,281 --> 00:05:41,020
You're supposed to get on a regular 
basis.

143
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:42,610
I need a multivitamin.
I got to do that,

144
00:05:42,611 --> 00:05:43,090
man.
I just,

145
00:05:43,091 --> 00:05:44,960
I want to,
but it makes me nauseous if I don't each

146
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:45,670
to.
Well,

147
00:05:45,671 --> 00:05:50,671
you should never take vitamins without 
food because the vitamins are absorbed 

148
00:05:50,671 --> 00:05:51,340
in your.
You mean they have to be in,

149
00:05:51,341 --> 00:05:51,400
in

150
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,440
contact,
in conjuncture with fat.

151
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:58,210
They have to be fiber and carbohydrates,
like all that stuff you don't get.

152
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:03,220
You're not going to get the full effect 
from a vitamin if you just eat the 

153
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:04,190
vitamin like you have.
You should eat vitamins always with food

154
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,090
and also to avoid that,
that upset stomach fucking horrible.

155
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,430
Weak stomach sick.
Well,

156
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:15,431
that's a gross feeling.
I have a fucking mouthful of pills just 

157
00:06:15,431 --> 00:06:15,440
sitting in an empty stomach waiting a 
breakdown.

158
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:16,660
It feels gross.
You want.

159
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,800
You have to resist the urge to Yack it 
up.

160
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:23,860
You've had a coffee and an orange juice,
like the horrible combination like I 

161
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:27,341
love people can order cereal with milk 
and orange juice to kind of fuck you do 

162
00:06:27,341 --> 00:06:27,440
that.
How do you not vomit that?

163
00:06:27,441 --> 00:06:32,441
Write up.
I'm coffee and they'll have a coffee on 

164
00:06:32,441 --> 00:06:34,601
the side.
They'll be taking sips to the cereal 

165
00:06:34,601 --> 00:06:34,601
aisle,
burping a or from last night,

166
00:06:34,601 --> 00:06:35,330
orange juice and the coffee.

167
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:38,240
Just fucking brutal combination.
Just a putrid stomach.

168
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:39,590
Oh,
let's get through these commercials.

169
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:40,370
Oh,
on it.

170
00:06:40,371 --> 00:06:42,500
We also have new kettlebells.
Kettlebells are in.

171
00:06:42,501 --> 00:06:47,501

172
00:06:47,501 --> 00:06:50,890
fitness,

175
00:06:56,081 --> 00:07:01,081
Buying for my friend Steve Maxwell.
Steve Maxwell's an amazing trainer and 

176
00:07:01,081 --> 00:07:04,460
I've had the pleasure of working with 
them a few times and I met him first and

177
00:07:04,461 --> 00:07:07,940
foremost from his dvds.
He has these incredible,

178
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:13,150
a tech guy.
He's like a very technical guy when it 

179
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:14,000
comes to Kettlebell training and he's 
like Brazilian Jiu Jitsu,

180
00:07:14,001 --> 00:07:15,710
black belt.
He's a real bad ass.

181
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:17,630
So the dude is incredible shape.
I mean,

182
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,690
I believe,
I don't wanna I don't wanna miss status,

183
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:23,110
but babies close to 60 years old.
Oh Wow.

184
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:28,150
The guy's incredibly fit.
I mean really a genius when it comes to 

185
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:32,060
a physical fitness and conditioning.
So if you're interested in,

186
00:07:32,061 --> 00:07:34,790
he's just my friend.
I'm not profiting from ms dot any way.

187
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:39,230
Go check out Steve Maxwell stuff because
it really truly is the best.

188
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:44,630
Uh,
Mike [inaudible] got some really good 

189
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,001
dvds as well.
And then there's one from a dragon 

190
00:07:46,001 --> 00:07:48,521
door.com,
but I really love called the extreme 

191
00:07:48,521 --> 00:07:51,341
kettlebell cardio workout.
I forgot the gentleman who is doing the 

192
00:07:51,341 --> 00:07:52,640
exercises,
but he's a fucking bad ass.

193
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:57,900
Um,
so we have kettle bells for sale at 

194
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:57,900
[inaudible] dot com.
They are the best you can buy.

195
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:02,651
These are your kettle bells.
These kettlebells will last you 

196
00:08:02,651 --> 00:08:03,440
literally for the rest of your fucking 
life.

197
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:08,470
They will.
They'll find them after the next 

198
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:10,511
apocalypse.
Archeologists will try to decipher what 

199
00:08:10,511 --> 00:08:10,511
the fuck these things.
Where next year,

200
00:08:10,511 --> 00:08:15,191
skeleton just holding one of these hands
that said it's not as cheap as we can 

201
00:08:15,201 --> 00:08:16,550
sell them,
but they're not that cheap.

202
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:21,620
It's very difficult to ship these cannon
balls through the fucking mail and and 

203
00:08:21,991 --> 00:08:23,450
still profit from it.
So.

204
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:28,720
But these are these a lifetime 
investment and I don't use anything 

205
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,750
else.
You don't need a gym membership.

206
00:08:29,751 --> 00:08:34,751
You don't need shit.
You need a backyard and some exercises 

207
00:08:34,751 --> 00:08:36,170
and some black site or even you don't 
even need a back yard.

208
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,390
If you have enough room inside your 
house.

209
00:08:38,391 --> 00:08:40,040
Like if you have a big room where you 
can,

210
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:45,250
you don't ever need to go to a gym,
you will get a fucking ruthless workout 

211
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:45,630
from Kettlebell.
What does that he was doing right there.

212
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:50,650
He was like,
he was like kind of taking it and 

213
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:50,650
letting us handle between his legs.
What is he working on there?

214
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:51,230
Well,
he's showing us.

215
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:55,040
The beautiful thing about kettlebells is
that everything you do,

216
00:08:55,380 --> 00:09:00,380
everything.
You're working a bunch of different 

217
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:00,380
groups of muscles.

218
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:04,040
You're not just what people think of.
Like what does that exercise for your 

219
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,100
shoulders would.
What an exercise should always really be

220
00:09:05,101 --> 00:09:10,101
for his functional movement.
You should be enhancing your ability to 

221
00:09:10,101 --> 00:09:14,421
move functionally and that doesn't 
always do that when you have like 

222
00:09:14,421 --> 00:09:17,270
isolated exercises like curls are like 
bench presses or shit like that.

223
00:09:17,641 --> 00:09:20,640
Like that's not really how the body is 
supposed to work,

224
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:23,190
right?
Your body supposed to work in a group,

225
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:24,940
everything together.
I mean,

226
00:09:24,941 --> 00:09:29,941
and that's,
that's what I find is the most 

227
00:09:29,941 --> 00:09:31,980
applicable to athletics.
When I started doing kettlebells I got,

228
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:37,010
I just got a lot stronger.
I got a lot stronger as far as my 

229
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:38,190
Jujitsu and my wind got better.
My,

230
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:39,740
my,
my ability to,

231
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,640
to like push a pace got better.
It's like you get it,

232
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:47,040
you get a muscular endurance from kettle
bells that's very rare,

233
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:52,190
uh,
doing other kinds of exercises and you 

234
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:52,190
get big from it too,
man.

235
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:53,500
And you don't have to do it that often.
You know,

236
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:55,290
these are,
it's a brutal workout.

237
00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:58,800
It's so hard that it breaks your tissue 
down and then,

238
00:09:58,801 --> 00:10:03,801
you know,
you need a few days off before you can 

239
00:10:03,801 --> 00:10:03,801
do it again.
You know,

240
00:10:03,801 --> 00:10:06,561
you might be able to do something else 
in between like some kickboxing or 

241
00:10:06,561 --> 00:10:10,131
something,
but when you're first starting to do 

242
00:10:10,131 --> 00:10:11,990
kettlebells,
you will be fucking amazed at how bad 

243
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:14,841
you get your ass kicked by.
One 35 pound kettle bell because you go 

244
00:10:14,841 --> 00:10:16,380
through all these exercises and it feels
easy for the first,

245
00:10:16,381 --> 00:10:18,720
like 15 seconds and then you realize,
you know,

246
00:10:18,721 --> 00:10:20,980
you got like seven more minutes to go,
which,

247
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:22,290
you know,
those are metal,

248
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:24,420
right?
How solid iron.

249
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:28,290
Those are solid iron kettle bells.
I have them in my gym.

250
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:29,700
Um,
I should probably use them,

251
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:34,110
but they're awesome to keep until the 
elliptical Joe fucking great too,

252
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:34,410
man.

253
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:38,910
I have a workout I do on the elliptical.
That is an unbelievably hard.

254
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:41,760
It,
you do a warm up for like 10 minutes.

255
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:45,870
And then I do these sprints of 30 
seconds.

256
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:50,280
As hard as I can go at a high level,
you know,

257
00:10:50,281 --> 00:10:54,060
as literally as hard as I can go.
Like I'm running for my fucking life.

258
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:56,910
And then take 30 seconds off in 30 
seconds just,

259
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:58,470
Oh,
just try to catch your breath.

260
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:01,020
Try to bring your heart rate down and 
then go to war again.

261
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:03,240
The next 30 seconds.
How long do you do this?

262
00:11:03,241 --> 00:11:04,620
For?
As long as I can do it.

263
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:08,010
Usually I get 10 to I can go.
I can do it 10 times.

264
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:10,380
As hard as you can.
As hard as I can.

265
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:12,270
Yeah,
it's not that much.

266
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:15,480
If I was an athlete,
that would be pathetic.

267
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:17,100
You know,
if I was a professional athlete,

268
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,420
you probably have a much better one than
I do.

269
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:23,430
Dude,
that's an awesome workout and it really 

270
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:25,851
applies to,
to physical things like applies for me 

271
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:26,610
when I hit the bag,
it applies for me to Jujitsu.

272
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,610
Like I can see that I can improve my 
cardio by doing that.

273
00:11:29,611 --> 00:11:31,350
So people like make fun of the 
elliptical,

274
00:11:31,351 --> 00:11:34,830
but you can work your fucking ass off in
the elliptical.

275
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:37,710
You just have to decide either you have 
to decide how to do it.

276
00:11:37,711 --> 00:11:39,840
You can,
you can go bananas on that thing and get

277
00:11:39,841 --> 00:11:42,390
an incredible workout.
We also have,

278
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:45,750
um,
but we also have battle ropes.

279
00:11:45,751 --> 00:11:50,751
These are the latest and greatest 
gadgets in the MMA training for like all

280
00:11:51,781 --> 00:11:54,100
these guys that are strength and 
conditioning coaches,

281
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:59,340
a lot of them are using these huge ropes
that you manipulate and they call them 

282
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:03,841
battle ropes and the ones that we have 
are 40 fucking feet long and you hurled 

283
00:12:03,851 --> 00:12:08,760
these ropes up and down and it's an 
incredible workout for your core and for

284
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:12,160
your wind and for your grip strength,
your grip.

285
00:12:12,161 --> 00:12:17,161
It's so incredible for your grip 
strength because you're connecting to 

286
00:12:17,161 --> 00:12:21,301
this gigantic heavy moving object and 
you're swinging it with your whole body 

287
00:12:21,821 --> 00:12:25,240
and not like a curl and not like doing 
tricep extensions.

288
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:28,500
That's like silly girly shit.
You want to get like a real

289
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:33,660
fucking manly workout.
You swing ropes around like a savage,

290
00:12:34,091 --> 00:12:39,091
like this motherfucker and what you do 
is fast forward a little so we can get 

291
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:40,180
to one of the exercises.
I doing it before.

292
00:12:40,181 --> 00:12:42,350
It's like he fucking brutal.
Yeah,

293
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:44,890
he has it.
I've used my own argument string before,

294
00:12:44,891 --> 00:12:48,580
but nothing like this.
Your old arguments during mild arguments

295
00:12:48,581 --> 00:12:49,630
during.
What does that mean?

296
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:54,930
It's not as good as these battle ropes.
They're like,

297
00:12:55,331 --> 00:12:56,710
this guy's shoes.
He's got those,

298
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:58,280
those toe shoes.
What that is.

299
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,640
I were,
but I'm very embarrassed by like,

300
00:13:00,641 --> 00:13:03,370
here's,
here's one of them you wear.

301
00:13:03,371 --> 00:13:04,960
Those do,
they're bad ass.

302
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:06,250
The,
the best for working out,

303
00:13:06,251 --> 00:13:09,010
but they're the gas footwear ever known 
to man.

304
00:13:09,011 --> 00:13:11,340
How many toes are actually like 
separated this telephone?

305
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:16,980
Five.
See You and Robert Kelly wearing those 

306
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:18,520
things would be little.
A little man personally with my,

307
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:20,290
with my fanny pack.
Bravo.

308
00:13:20,291 --> 00:13:22,150
Wears them around everywhere and 
anywhere.

309
00:13:22,151 --> 00:13:22,630
His,
his,

310
00:13:22,631 --> 00:13:25,210
uh,
his little toe things.

311
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:28,210
He wears those bitches ever leave time 
I've ever seen those where I was like,

312
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,770
yes,
that that's acceptable.

313
00:13:29,771 --> 00:13:32,950
Is the sunset.
Jesus guy wears them now.

314
00:13:32,951 --> 00:13:33,460
And I'm like,
you know,

315
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,680
that's perfect for you.
Perfect for a sentence where she.

316
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,050
As far as cost,
that's what it'd be like.

317
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:41,630
Jesus would wear toe shoes anyway.
Uh,

318
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,710
for all this information about the 
nootropics,

319
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:46,060
the vitamins,
about the supplements for,

320
00:13:46,061 --> 00:13:46,130
for

321
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:49,280
athleticism and serotonin boosting,
new mood,

322
00:13:49,281 --> 00:13:51,070
all that shit.
Go to [inaudible] dot com.

323
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:54,290
I believe in this stuff.
I use it.

324
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:59,380
I the only reason why I'm we sell it at 
all or I have any affiliation with it 

325
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:03,120
because I was using new nootropics and 
vitamins long before I ever was 

326
00:14:04,521 --> 00:14:09,521
affiliated with on it.
It's something that I've always been 

327
00:14:09,521 --> 00:14:11,831
interested in.
I've been taking vitamins most of my 

328
00:14:11,831 --> 00:14:13,601
life and I very strongly believe in 
supplements and healthy diet and it's 

329
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:19,360
all very important to me,
but what it's also important is having 

330
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:19,360
people never feel like they get ripped 
off.

331
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,540
So if you order anything like Alpha 
brain and you try it,

332
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:27,580
your first 30 pills,
you get 100 percent money back 

333
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:30,311
guarantee.
You don't even have to return the 

334
00:14:30,311 --> 00:14:30,311
product to say,
this sucks.

335
00:14:30,311 --> 00:14:31,160
Giving my money back.
That is how,

336
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:36,340
first of all,
how confident we are that you're going 

337
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:36,340
to enjoy it and it's good.
You're going to feel a benefit from them

338
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:37,160
and be how it's.
Look,

339
00:14:37,161 --> 00:14:38,480
I don't.
Nobody wants to get ripped off.

340
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:40,220
I don't want to get ripped off.
I don't want to rip you off.

341
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:43,310
We're just trying to sell good stuff and
make some money.

342
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:44,750
All right,
go to [inaudible] dot com.

343
00:14:44,751 --> 00:14:45,650

346
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:54,950
I really need that shit.
You need to for my energy.

347
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:56,450
Do we have a bottle here?
Brian?

348
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,550
Is there a bottle of alphabet?
Atlanta?

349
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:02,900
I think think I lost it in yesterday's 
confusion,

350
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,080
but I'll double check.
Alright.

351
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:07,610
Alright.
Cue The music.

352
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:10,050

357
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:34,330
Thank you joe.
Little Jimmy.

358
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:35,890
You like Chael Sonnen?
Who's.

359
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,490
What's,
what's going on with you?

360
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:43,770
I can't wait.
I know it's going to be crazy to be 

361
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:43,960
there live while that's happening and to
get the call it.

362
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,830
I got chills just thinking about it.
You have a great job man.

363
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:49,300
It's the best job of all time.
Yeah,

364
00:15:49,301 --> 00:15:51,850
it's amazing.
So it's amazing that it exists.

365
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:52,820
You know,
I mean,

366
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:57,840
when I first started doing me and data,
we've talked about this a bunch of 

367
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,080
times.
We first started working for the UFC and

368
00:15:59,081 --> 00:16:01,000
you would tell people that you're 
involved in it.

369
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:03,160
It's almost like you're talking about 
porn,

370
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:08,260
right?
That's what cage fighting was like and 

371
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:10,270
now it is just incredibly mainstream 
thing.

372
00:16:10,271 --> 00:16:15,271
It's really interesting.
It's an embarrassing thing for New York 

373
00:16:15,271 --> 00:16:16,450
too that it's not legal there and we all
know other nonsense is going on,

374
00:16:16,451 --> 00:16:17,540
but it's embarrassing for Neela.

375
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:22,590
It makes New York looked like this 
irrelevant all old thinking place and 

376
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:26,910
the more boxing and I watched boxing.
It's a great sport but I can't enjoy 

377
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:28,060
anything.
Like I enjoyed the UFC.

378
00:16:28,061 --> 00:16:29,800
It's really weird.
Like people get mad at me.

379
00:16:29,801 --> 00:16:31,690
I know and aches.
I'm such a fucking whore for this,

380
00:16:31,691 --> 00:16:36,691
but it's like I don't,
I don't want to hear about baseball 

381
00:16:36,691 --> 00:16:36,691
because a lot of baseball players I've 
met had been Dick's.

382
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:39,130
A lot of football players had been 
dicks,

383
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:41,770
but at all the UFC guys,
you're great.

384
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:46,790
Like I've,
I haven't met any of them that were 

385
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:46,790
assholes.
I've met most of the big ones.

386
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:49,120
Every one of them is nice with the fans 
and is nice to us when they come in.

387
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:51,160
Well,
I've always said that people are.

388
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:56,200
I think every man needs to learn at 
least something about martial arts and 

389
00:16:56,831 --> 00:17:01,831
something about how to defend yourself 
to get your that sorta chimpanzee 

390
00:17:03,491 --> 00:17:07,630
bullshit out of your system that makes 
most men become dicks.

391
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:12,900
I think a lot of people are dicks simply
because they're frustrated physically 

392
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:16,640
like their body feels like physically,
like confined by its inaction,

393
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:23,790
but confined by the stress of everyday 
life and having to pay bills and just 

394
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:29,730
shit is always built up inside of you.
If you don't do something to blow that 

395
00:17:29,831 --> 00:17:32,050
out physically and balance your body 
back,

396
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:37,051
I think you can.
You can have a hard time in this life 

397
00:17:37,051 --> 00:17:39,601
and you can overreact to people.
You could maybe be already be at a five 

398
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:42,420
and this guy says something and you 
crank it up to eight and you're like,

399
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:43,610
come off.
He,

400
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,300
he yourself feel like a dick.
Like,

401
00:17:46,301 --> 00:17:47,370
why did I do that?
What the.

402
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:49,410
But you realize what it is.
You're,

403
00:17:49,411 --> 00:17:50,910
you're,
you're already wound up.

404
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,310
You don't even realize it.
You're,

405
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:57,380
you're going through life.
Wound up something like martial arts can

406
00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:02,780
get that out of your system called and 
told me I'm a fucking car gangster 

407
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:06,420
because I talk so much shit in the car,
but it's a very reasonable and somebody 

408
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:06,420
is six three.

409
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:09,720
He's a gangster.
All is so fucking funny.

410
00:18:09,721 --> 00:18:11,400
It really is the fucking funniest guy 
alive.

411
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:14,460
He's so funny.
He's such a treasure.

412
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:18,180
He's one of those guys that you like.
You have to experience him live to,

413
00:18:18,181 --> 00:18:20,060
to get the full effect of his comedy.
Yeah.

414
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:21,860
When,
when he,

415
00:18:21,861 --> 00:18:22,980
uh,
did tough crowd.

416
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:28,130
I never got a chance to see them live 
that much because I was already living 

417
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:29,460
in La and he was almost always in New 
York.

418
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:34,940
But when we did a tough crowd,
he would go up and to stand up to the 

419
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:36,090
honest to God.
I forgot how funny he is.

420
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:36,780
I was,
I'm with you.

421
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:37,460
Yeah,
yeah,

422
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:38,340
yeah.
And we did it together.

423
00:18:38,341 --> 00:18:39,780
I don't know who else was on it.
I don't remember.

424
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,030
He was so funny.
Oh my God.

425
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:43,240
He just.
Because he.

426
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:44,760
And here's the thing,
we'll call them the amazing.

427
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:48,450
It's like he never gets angry at the 
audience are not going with them and I'm

428
00:18:48,451 --> 00:18:49,080
like,
he just,

429
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:50,040
he addresses it.

430
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:53,520
All right folks just plow,
but he doesn't.

431
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:58,790
And Louise in a weird way the same way,
like they throw out what they throw out 

432
00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:02,271
and they don't react emotionally.
They allowed the audience to have their 

433
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:03,360
own emotion and that's a weakness in my 
performance is I try to fucking.

434
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:06,600
I bring the emotion and it's just like 
he did it all for a stupid.

435
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:09,840
It's not having no faith in the words.
So that's what I'm saying to myself.

436
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:14,430
It's sort of a cro me,
there's a fine line between like I would

437
00:19:14,431 --> 00:19:19,431
hear that Jay Leno would go and work out
his monologue and he would do it flat 

438
00:19:19,431 --> 00:19:21,780
and he did it on purpose that way we'd 
work it out.

439
00:19:21,781 --> 00:19:26,781
The comedy Magic Club.
He would do those jokes on purpose flat 

440
00:19:26,781 --> 00:19:26,790
because he didn't want to have to jazz 
them up.

441
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:31,791
He didn't want to say you wanted to find
out if the concept on its own is good 

442
00:19:31,791 --> 00:19:34,530
and from there you can jazz it up,
but that's a gross feeling.

443
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:37,050
When you're trying to jazz something up,
sort of artificially.

444
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:42,500
Yeah,
I prefer to work out material the same 

445
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,451
way.
I mean that's what a pompous ass comic 

446
00:19:44,451 --> 00:19:46,071
would say,
but I really do it the seller with no 

447
00:19:46,071 --> 00:19:46,920
energy completely deadpan and just see 
how the words work without with.

448
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:51,980
Because you don't want to get a laugh 
going whatever face you make like a 

449
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:57,740
fucking rye look.
You want it to be funny because it's 

450
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:57,740
funny but it's hard to do that because 
a,

451
00:19:57,740 --> 00:20:00,030
it bombs a lot of the time.
How do you write?

452
00:20:00,031 --> 00:20:03,900
Do you write your material?
Like do you like get an idea and say,

453
00:20:03,901 --> 00:20:08,901
all right,
when we sit down and think of how I 

454
00:20:08,901 --> 00:20:09,420
would put this idea to the audience or 
do you.

455
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:12,990
Do you like blogs and pull your jokes 
out of it?

456
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:15,150
No,
I just want a lot of guys do it.

457
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:17,160
I just go on because I'm at the cellar 
every night,

458
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:22,340
so I went on to live with Travolta,
like I just shot this special and I was 

459
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:22,340
like,
alright,

460
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:25,370
I'm done with that fucking hour,
so I want to start over because anymore 

461
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:25,680
that doing that material again is 
repulsive to me.

462
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:28,770
Never want to say those words again.
I fucking hate it.

463
00:20:28,771 --> 00:20:30,360
I'm sick of watching it.
I think they did it.

464
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:36,270
So now I want to do something else.
So thank God Travolta had all this 

465
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:39,081
malarkey happened.
So I just went on and started talking 

466
00:20:39,081 --> 00:20:39,081
about Travolta and uh,
you know,

467
00:20:39,081 --> 00:20:41,560
trying to grab guys Cox to the thing and
I had fun with it and then I,

468
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:46,570
I kind of built it up.
I was waiting to hear what your take on 

469
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:46,620
it would be.
As soon as I saw it in the news,

470
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:48,040
I said I would love

471
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:52,810
to talk to Jimmy about this because on 
one hand you got to say,

472
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:58,110
okay,
there got to be a lot of guys who just 

473
00:20:58,110 --> 00:20:58,240
sucked his dick because he was doing it 
that often.

474
00:20:58,510 --> 00:21:01,340
If he was pulling it out that often on 
these [inaudible] I,

475
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:06,360
I bet it's probably because there's a 
bunch of them were jumped on that 

476
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,300
grenade.
Do you know how many.

477
00:21:07,301 --> 00:21:08,620
Whose fault is that?
Really?

478
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:13,740
I don't.
I don't fault him because I couldn't 

479
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:13,740
believe I believed them though because 
the language,

480
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:17,970
like I believe the one who accused Al 
Gore because the language they use is 

481
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:19,630
language I've used.
Like when he said that Al Gore,

482
00:21:19,631 --> 00:21:22,600
like the woman said that he said,
could you rub my receptors or whatever.

483
00:21:22,601 --> 00:21:22,990
I'm like,
oh,

484
00:21:22,991 --> 00:21:27,991
that's a typical fucking perv move.
You use our literal and appropriate 

485
00:21:29,081 --> 00:21:31,840
language so they can accuse you of 
trying to get,

486
00:21:32,050 --> 00:21:32,680
you know.
Excuse me,

487
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:35,380
would you,
would you mind rubbing my chakras?

488
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,180
You know,
and we both know what I'm saying,

489
00:21:37,181 --> 00:21:38,380
but she can't get mad at you.

490
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:43,610
My Dad,
when I was a kid,

491
00:21:43,611 --> 00:21:44,420
my dad always said,
hey,

492
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:46,070
that's your paper.
Every time I was like,

493
00:21:46,071 --> 00:21:51,071
what's this?
And then it was like I was in fifth 

494
00:21:51,071 --> 00:21:51,071
grade.

495
00:21:51,071 --> 00:21:53,710
Right.
Well you're talking about should 

496
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:55,760
probably avoid saying suck my paper 
because I think that would be easy to 

497
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:56,130
decipher.
I don't think you'd have to call him the

498
00:21:56,131 --> 00:22:01,131
fucking guys who broke the Jap code to 
figure out how to put a paper is.

499
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:04,680
Well your honor,
we can't say for sure.

500
00:22:04,681 --> 00:22:07,970
It was his penis sucked my paper.
It was very ambiguous.

501
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:09,810
It could be anything,
but I still use it now.

502
00:22:09,811 --> 00:22:11,740
You know,
I use it with girls that do you really,

503
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:16,880
for some reason the two of you playing 
with your nipples and you look down and 

504
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,391
just just tell her to kiss your people.
That's even creepier and more childlike 

505
00:22:20,391 --> 00:22:23,330
noodles or kissimmee paper may present 
my noodles.

506
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,440
I know I never used words I never asked.
I'm like,

507
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:28,150
I do this silent and it's funny.
I was going to do some of this on,

508
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:33,170
on Leno tonight,
but I just said I had to bail on a 

509
00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:33,170
little bit because I was on with Justin 
Bieber.

510
00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:35,280
It was all fucking 15 year old girls and
I'm like,

511
00:22:35,281 --> 00:22:40,281
what?
They've never gotten a happy ending 

512
00:22:40,281 --> 00:22:40,281
massage.
Um,

513
00:22:40,281 --> 00:22:40,281
so I kind of bailed on the sosh drove 
ultimate cheer.

514
00:22:40,281 --> 00:22:44,841
I didn't do any of it.
That's a good move because you probably 

515
00:22:44,841 --> 00:22:47,271
save the minds of all those different 15
year old kids from the creepy ideas you 

516
00:22:47,271 --> 00:22:51,801
have that are based on truth,
but all of a sudden they're going to be 

517
00:22:51,801 --> 00:22:52,920
driving by these massage power's going,
which one of these jerk you off?

518
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:54,960
Does that Daddy?
Does that one jerk guys off?

519
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,850
Or even worse,
you're gonna put on pulp fiction and go,

520
00:22:56,851 --> 00:23:01,851
wow.
He grabbed the penis and then a couple 

521
00:23:01,851 --> 00:23:03,471
of minutes later grabbed the scrotum.
I wish I would have committed to the 

522
00:23:03,471 --> 00:23:06,291
travolta stuff.
I'm kind of mad at myself that I went 

523
00:23:06,291 --> 00:23:06,291
away from it and I just wanted to stop.

524
00:23:06,291 --> 00:23:09,760
Do you see what Letterman did?
A bieber the other last week I heard it 

525
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:09,760
was uncomfortable.
Yeah.

526
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,540
That was really what was like,
oh,

527
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:11,620
he,
uh,

528
00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:12,770
we could probably show it,
but he,

529
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:17,780
he got a new tattoo and then letterman 
was kind of acting weird and then tried 

530
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:19,080
to grab his tattoo and he had just got 
it done.

531
00:23:19,081 --> 00:23:21,200
So it was like bloody and stuff and he 
wouldn't.

532
00:23:21,201 --> 00:23:22,350
He was.
And B was like,

533
00:23:22,351 --> 00:23:22,890
no,
stop,

534
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:23,880
stop,
stop,

535
00:23:23,881 --> 00:23:28,881
stop.
But he wouldn't stop like that extra 

536
00:23:28,881 --> 00:23:31,311
second and then it was just like a 
beaver mispronounce something and then 

537
00:23:32,101 --> 00:23:32,700
he's like,
yeah,

538
00:23:32,701 --> 00:23:37,701
that's Canadian high school for you.
But the whole attitude of the whole 

539
00:23:37,701 --> 00:23:37,701
thing seemed very good

540
00:23:37,701 --> 00:23:38,550
in chapel.
Yeah.

541
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:40,310
The crowd was the crowd with them where 
they call.

542
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:42,050
I don't know man.
We could watch it if you want to.

543
00:23:42,051 --> 00:23:42,960
I'll find out.
I'm serious.

544
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:46,010
Well,
what was the problem he had with

545
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:51,010
them?
Was it just he didn't want to be 

546
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:51,010
interviewing Justin Bieber's I wouldn't 
want.

547
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:54,520
I don't know man.
I think he was just trying to act like 

548
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,651
the old man,
the old grumpy dad that started coming 

549
00:23:56,651 --> 00:23:57,650
like just had a weird.
It was a weird sometimes man,

550
00:23:57,660 --> 00:24:02,660
you just can't.
You don't jibe with someone you don't 

551
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:02,860
realize until you're out there talking 
to them,

552
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:04,270
but you're fighting for your life.
You know,

553
00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:07,260
I had to get off a conversation and you 
know,

554
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:10,700
as comics,
I mean we've all gone for something that

555
00:24:10,701 --> 00:24:13,940
was just ridiculous in hindsight,
but in the moment,

556
00:24:13,941 --> 00:24:18,941
you know,
you think that would be funny if I grab 

557
00:24:18,941 --> 00:24:18,941
his tattoo and just fucking hold onto 
the little fog that it just gets cricket

558
00:24:18,941 --> 00:24:23,350
and you're like,
I got to let go and come back to my 

559
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:23,350
seat.
But he'll laugh and think like,

560
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:23,350
who?

561
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:26,300
Like what does he do?
Does he try to get inside the mindset of

562
00:24:26,301 --> 00:24:29,240
a Justin Bieber who is further for them?
Justin Bieber.

563
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:34,300
Then David Letterman,
human spectrum in the United States of 

564
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:35,300
America.
I'm pretty fucking Goddamn far apart,

565
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:40,450
but he probably doesn't even think.
He probably just does what he wants to 

566
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:40,450
do without fear of it not working.
That's fine.

567
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:44,500
Why let him into it?
He probably is not afraid there's not 

568
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:44,500
going to work.
Yeah.

569
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:44,500
It just gives it a shot.
I was worried though.

570
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:46,430
I mean it's like 20 years of stand up.
Finally.

571
00:24:46,431 --> 00:24:49,070
I was able to adjust and make it a 
decent appearance,

572
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:51,320
but it was like that could've been 
fucking death.

573
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,650
Cookies was we went to break because I 
did better than I thought you'd do,

574
00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:57,110
which made me kind of laugh.
Funny.

575
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:58,730
Yeah,
that's.

576
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:03,880
I've done those shows at the improv 
before where they have some sort of a 

577
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:07,331
high school tour and you look out there 
and at the Improv and a professional 

578
00:25:07,331 --> 00:25:11,501
show,
you look out this 14 and 15 year old 

579
00:25:11,501 --> 00:25:11,501
kids.

580
00:25:11,501 --> 00:25:11,501
You're like,
what's going on here?

581
00:25:11,501 --> 00:25:12,150
Yeah,
what am I going to do that?

582
00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:16,190
Or he went up and went extra dirty.
It was ridiculous.

583
00:25:16,410 --> 00:25:17,960
Our.
He went up and I was like,

584
00:25:17,961 --> 00:25:19,790
did you go extra dirty for those kids?
He goes,

585
00:25:19,791 --> 00:25:23,120
yeah,
Kinda didn't work.

586
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:24,950
Oh Yeah,
you kidding me?

587
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:26,840
Yeah.
I mean people were freaking out.

588
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:30,290
I mean,
you're literally talking about the first

589
00:25:30,291 --> 00:25:33,530
time a kid has ever heard anything 
remotely like that.

590
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:37,790
I mean when you're 13 and 14,
especially when we did these shows,

591
00:25:37,791 --> 00:25:39,300
it was a few years back,
you know,

592
00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:44,770
I don't know how much,
how many kids were getting online but 

593
00:25:44,770 --> 00:25:44,770
to,
to see,

594
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:50,430
to watch comedy online,
but to see it like live and in person 

595
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:51,500
like that here it,
they had never experienced anything like

596
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:54,890
a standup comic doing a dirty act in a 
nightclub in Hollywood.

597
00:25:54,891 --> 00:25:55,880
Like they were blown away.

598
00:25:55,880 --> 00:26:00,880
It was crazy.
Well these were all girls who were 15 

599
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,431
year old girl,
16 girls in front of him to that creepy 

600
00:26:03,431 --> 00:26:03,431
as fuck.
Screaming fucking.

601
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:04,670
It's uncomfortable.
You're like,

602
00:26:04,671 --> 00:26:09,671
I'll never know what that's like.
They actually made them do it for me 

603
00:26:09,671 --> 00:26:09,671
cause yeah,
you all do promos,

604
00:26:09,671 --> 00:26:13,781
you'll go stand there.
So the three of us were standing there 

605
00:26:13,781 --> 00:26:13,781
with Leno at the end just doing the 
promo to,

606
00:26:13,781 --> 00:26:15,410
to the news channels and he goes,
just give a scream,

607
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:16,340
uh,
for Jim.

608
00:26:16,341 --> 00:26:18,260
So we made all the girls scream from and
it was kind of,

609
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:22,280
it felt nice as a nice for once.
I mean I knew it wasn't sincere.

610
00:26:22,281 --> 00:26:24,170
Beautiful it.
I enjoyed it for the moment.

611
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:26,040
Nice.
Here's the,

612
00:26:26,041 --> 00:26:27,920
uh,
the Letterman bieber thing.

613
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:31,370
It's 10 from TMZ.com
explaining this to me.

614
00:26:31,371 --> 00:26:33,920
Is that a new tattoo?
Oh God.

615
00:26:33,921 --> 00:26:35,960
How many do you have?
I have a couple.

616
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:39,230
Just a couple will tell me that's the 
last one.

617
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:42,440
No,
no it is.

618
00:26:42,441 --> 00:26:43,860
You don't.
I mean honestly,

619
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:49,580
like how does that help?
How does that help how you looked at 

620
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:49,800
ever tattoo?
How does it not?

621
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:50,600
I mean,
it doesn't,

622
00:26:50,601 --> 00:26:55,560
not help the way I look into expressing.
Yesterday my album came out as a day for

623
00:26:55,561 --> 00:26:56,900
me,
so you know,

624
00:26:56,901 --> 00:26:59,160
I got bullied.
Hey.

625
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:00,720
Hey.
Hey.

626
00:27:00,721 --> 00:27:01,650
This is a brand new.

627
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:11,810
Awesome.
Those were areas

628
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,440
you did just then you went,
hey.

629
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:15,510
Hey.
Yeah.

630
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:16,840
Canadians.
The Canadian.

631
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:22,430
Now mom can't be pleased with the 
tattoos.

632
00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:23,590
Mom,
you know,

633
00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:25,070
she's a mom.
Have a tattoo.

634
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:25,750
She does.
No,

635
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,940
I don't think so.
Does Dad ever dare to.

636
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:31,580
Oh,
do me a favor.

637
00:27:31,581 --> 00:27:32,780
Don't go nuts.
You know what I mean?

638
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:38,290
Because more and more.
You see like the mural and the like the 

639
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:39,760
sistine chapel on.
It's too much.

640
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:41,510
I'm not going from the 16th chapel.

641
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:52,840
This is hilarious.

642
00:27:53,890 --> 00:27:55,150
Canadian high school.

643
00:27:57,330 --> 00:27:59,880
Can I tell you what's so great about 
watching that as a comic?

644
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:05,120
When he said Sixteenth Chapel,
you could watch letterman as a comedian 

645
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,990
go,
oh God just gave me that.

646
00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:10,290
You relish the moment and he knew it was
going to get a laugh,

647
00:28:10,291 --> 00:28:12,120
whatever he said.
I thought that was great.

648
00:28:12,121 --> 00:28:12,780
Yeah,
that was very funny.

649
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:15,030
I didn't think there was anything wrong 
with that at all.

650
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:15,510
Oh No,
no.

651
00:28:15,511 --> 00:28:16,520
I mean that's what people are saying.
No,

652
00:28:16,521 --> 00:28:19,990
they.
They attacked that Bieber fans.

653
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:21,520
Fans are silly.
You look,

654
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:22,940
kick him off looking great.
Yeah.

655
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:24,940
He handled it well.
Beaverton too upset by it.

656
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:29,960
No,
he seemed like he went with the flow 

657
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:29,960
really well and I thought that was 
really funny.

658
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:30,150
I don't know why anybody would have a 
problem with that.

659
00:28:30,151 --> 00:28:32,730
That was just letterman being letterman.
He's the best man.

660
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:34,020
What would you do in that situation?

661
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:35,330
Would you,
if you were like on pet,

662
00:28:35,370 --> 00:28:38,100
would you commit to the stuff or hey,
this is what I was going to talk about,

663
00:28:38,101 --> 00:28:39,630
or would you like make an adjustment of 
your head?

664
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:41,940
I don't know.
I don't like doing those.

665
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,260
I got to tell you,
I don't,

666
00:28:43,610 --> 00:28:45,790
you know,
it's this,

667
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:49,860
it's a craft in itself constructing the 
five minute set for,

668
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:54,880
for talk shows and there's totally 
different like line of standup comedy.

669
00:28:55,870 --> 00:29:00,870
It's like there's your standup comedy 
and then there's these weird portal 

670
00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:04,440
stops that you do and one of them is the
five minute set on a tonight show.

671
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:09,990
Squeaky clean or least except for like 
some innuendo but nothing too crazy.

672
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:13,710
Nothing political,
nothing really ultra controversial,

673
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:14,970
right?
And No,

674
00:29:14,971 --> 00:29:17,880
no ability to expand upon anything for 
five minutes.

675
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,950
It's so quick know you're in,
you're out.

676
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:24,980
You just got to get a few points across 
real quick and all your best bets are 

677
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:26,250
two and a half minutes long.

678
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:29,610
So it's not like you're going to do two 
bits and then bail.

679
00:29:29,611 --> 00:29:34,070
So you're going to kind of chop stuff up
a little bit or construct a set for,

680
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:35,280
you know,
you know what I mean?

681
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:40,620
I couldn't even show a clip from the 
special they want to when I show a clip 

682
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:40,620
and I'm like,
Hey,

683
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:41,950
like what do I do?
The thing about Sharpton dying,

684
00:29:41,951 --> 00:29:43,590
do I do the thing about the fucking 
Moscow,

685
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:47,140
none of that will work,
so we showed a promo for the special,

686
00:29:47,141 --> 00:29:52,141
which it was a very funny promo,
but the standup itself I couldn't show 

687
00:29:52,141 --> 00:29:52,570
because I knew none of it would play and
it's all too fucking long.

688
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:55,780
It's all more than 40 seconds of course,
because you have points,

689
00:29:55,781 --> 00:29:57,790
you have points of view,
you have ideas.

690
00:29:58,030 --> 00:30:01,120
It's real hard to express any of that in
five minutes.

691
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:03,520
I found that every like short set that I
ever did,

692
00:30:03,521 --> 00:30:04,330
I just felt like shit.

693
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:09,720
That makes me feel good to hear you say 
that though because it's like you feel 

694
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:12,871
like as a comic,
like why can't I just go out there and 

695
00:30:12,871 --> 00:30:14,860
fucking hit home runs when I do these 
things for five or six minutes in the 

696
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:14,860
club either.
I mean it's.

697
00:30:14,930 --> 00:30:16,150
Look,
it is what it is.

698
00:30:16,151 --> 00:30:21,151
It's a great promotion of vehicle.
Obviously it's an honor to be on the 

699
00:30:21,151 --> 00:30:21,400
tonight show as always and when you do a
set,

700
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,800
definitely people are going to see it 
and it's going to help your career.

701
00:30:23,801 --> 00:30:26,550
No doubt about it,
but it's not a bet,

702
00:30:26,610 --> 00:30:28,900
a really good representation of your 
standup,

703
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:31,450
a good representation of your standup is
in a club,

704
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:32,710
you know,
and that's really what we do.

705
00:30:32,770 --> 00:30:34,090
You know,
even theater,

706
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:39,230
I mean theater is great because you can 
get more people to come out and see you 

707
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:39,230
and you know,
you still still can be a lot of fun,

708
00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:44,430
but ideally if a theater is at nine 
point nine of a comedy clubs at 10.

709
00:30:45,730 --> 00:30:46,720
Yeah.
You know what I mean?

710
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:48,310
It's only a little bit less to do with 
it,

711
00:30:48,311 --> 00:30:53,311
but a club like 200 seater man,
you know when you're right there and 

712
00:30:53,311 --> 00:30:57,361
you're fucking it,
you're so tuned into the crowd and the 

713
00:30:57,361 --> 00:30:57,361
crowd,
they,

714
00:30:57,361 --> 00:30:58,240
they're having so much fun.
It's like the,

715
00:30:58,241 --> 00:31:00,080
the,
the amount of laughs and the,

716
00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:00,880
the,
the,

717
00:31:00,910 --> 00:31:01,340
the,
the,

718
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:04,390
the full energy you get of killing in 
front of 200 people.

719
00:31:04,391 --> 00:31:05,890
It's very,
very,

720
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:09,190
very few things in life.
Are that powerful?

721
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:11,340
Bounces back at you like you feel it 
when it's again,

722
00:31:11,341 --> 00:31:13,430
it's a small room,
like the comedy cellar in New York.

723
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:16,690
Just fuck it.
Just pound the store.

724
00:31:16,691 --> 00:31:17,800
Yeah,
original rule in the store.

725
00:31:17,810 --> 00:31:22,810
You're killing on that stage.
It just comes right back all over your 

726
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:22,810
comedy works.
Denver.

727
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:23,680
Um,
I've only done that once.

728
00:31:23,681 --> 00:31:25,810
I did well there,
but I didn't draw that right there.

729
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:26,640
Oh yeah,
true.

730
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:27,930
Okay.
How long ago was this?

731
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:29,710
I have four or five years ago.
How dare you?

732
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:31,510
I know.
I would love to do it and go back.

733
00:31:31,511 --> 00:31:32,950
Yeah,
I think things have changed.

734
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:33,970
Yeah.
I think the,

735
00:31:33,971 --> 00:31:35,420
uh,
you know,

736
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,720
the Internet has helped all of us sort 
of get,

737
00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:39,700
get our voice out.
I don't know,

738
00:31:39,701 --> 00:31:44,701
man.
I feel like I can't get me fucking kind 

739
00:31:44,701 --> 00:31:44,701
of internet buzz it all.
Everything I do gets 5,000

740
00:31:44,701 --> 00:31:48,691
views.
That's all you have to do is do a 

741
00:31:48,691 --> 00:31:48,691
podcast.
Why don't you do what Anthony's doing if

742
00:31:48,691 --> 00:31:50,080
you did your own podcast,
I know it's hard because you're on.

743
00:31:50,081 --> 00:31:51,760
Oh,
and a five hours a day.

744
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:54,010
But if you did your own podcast once a 
week,

745
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:55,010
no,
once,

746
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:58,120
just something people love that it's 
free.

747
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:03,900
They can get your show on Xm,
but they have to pay or they have to go 

748
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:05,430
illegal and go with tolerance and risk 
behind,

749
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,680
creeping up your ass asshole microscope,
you know.

750
00:32:07,730 --> 00:32:10,330
Um,
but if you give them something for free,

751
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:13,120
like end into his shows,
not just Jimmy oriented,

752
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:15,340
you know,
it's like a gang of people.

753
00:32:15,341 --> 00:32:17,140
If you had your own podcast,
that was all you.

754
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:22,200
Well I guess you do the music thing,
but that's not a serious show too.

755
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,070
Yeah.
But I'm also,

756
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:29,080
I don't,
I don't know if I'm allowed to 

757
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,121
contractually to be honest.
You might not be allowed to do a 

758
00:32:30,121 --> 00:32:30,430
podcast.
They allow me to perform on them.

759
00:32:30,431 --> 00:32:35,431
I don't know if they'll allow me to 
actually do one and market it as a Jim 

760
00:32:35,431 --> 00:32:35,431
Norton vehicle because it's a different 
platform.

761
00:32:35,431 --> 00:32:36,160
I don't know.
Hm.

762
00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:38,650
That's interesting.
If they could play it,

763
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:40,430
I don't see why they would have a 
problem with it,

764
00:32:40,431 --> 00:32:40,920
you know,
like if,

765
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:42,910
if they also played it,
you know,

766
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:45,140
because that's what we do with them.
You know,

767
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:48,200
we were,
we have a broadcast and we're on Sirius.

768
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,810
We go on to Onh right.
But we just,

769
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:52,880
uh,
we just give it to them,

770
00:32:53,170 --> 00:32:58,170
which is give it to them for free.
It's just smart thing to do because 

771
00:32:58,170 --> 00:32:59,480
you're right,
nobody wants to pay for Shit and we want

772
00:32:59,481 --> 00:33:01,340
to do an on a podcast,
but we just put it up,

773
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:04,250
give them an hour a week for free to get
people who aren't into the show,

774
00:33:04,251 --> 00:33:06,150
into the shell and mean expanding 
marketing.

775
00:33:06,151 --> 00:33:08,290
Everybody understands why I don't,
I probably could have just said that and

776
00:33:08,291 --> 00:33:10,580
not explained it.
But then some people think,

777
00:33:10,581 --> 00:33:12,770
well that's all they would need is that 
hour a week.

778
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:17,800
You know,
they'll just take that hour week and 

779
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:17,800
they'll add it to the five hours the 
Corolla puts out,

780
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:18,360
puts out,
you know,

781
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:23,500
a couple of hours a week.
And I mean if you really stop and think 

782
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:23,500
about how many great podcasts are out 
there right now,

783
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:24,550
there's,
you know,

784
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:29,860
how many,
how many hours do you have to fucking 

785
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:29,860
know people.

786
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:30,890
It's a weird sort of a situation where 
it gets to.

787
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:36,190
There's a saturation point where 
especially ones like ours that are like 

788
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:36,860
three hours long sometimes.
How many,

789
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:38,440
how many of those can you have?
You know,

790
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,070
will you have a bigger name going into 
it anyway?

791
00:33:40,071 --> 00:33:41,960
I think I starting up and trying to do 
something like that.

792
00:33:41,961 --> 00:33:43,870
It's a lot harder.
I mean you have a trauma.

793
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,350
It's 600,000
people on twitter,

794
00:33:45,351 --> 00:33:48,380
so I on a thousand at this point.
I remember when you had like fucking 80.

795
00:33:49,030 --> 00:33:51,290
I remember when I was like,
I was like 12 when you were like 80.

796
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:52,800
Like all right,
I'll catch Rogan and boys.

797
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:57,840
You fucking just quadruple.
Well Louise got like one point $3 

798
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:58,460
million now.
I looked at that but he's on fire.

799
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:03,700
Doesn't Tosh have something credible?
Isn't tosh like 7 million or something 

800
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:04,940
and I'm going to get 4 million,
something like that,

801
00:34:04,941 --> 00:34:05,900
but I'm going to be five.

802
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:10,900
But uh,
yeah he's probably the biggest comic or 

803
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:10,900
oh,
Kevin Hart,

804
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:12,230
Kevin Hart and Tosh what?
Kevin is A.

805
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:15,410
I keep hearing about him,
like killing it.

806
00:34:15,411 --> 00:34:20,411
I keep hearing about him.
Like I don't know where he's at but I 

807
00:34:20,411 --> 00:34:20,840
keep hearing like,
you know how funny it shows our.

808
00:34:20,990 --> 00:34:22,880
I've never watched him.
I hear he's counted.

809
00:34:22,881 --> 00:34:25,550
His Shell is funny and comedy central 
like I haven't heard any comics shitting

810
00:34:25,551 --> 00:34:26,460
on him either.
No,

811
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:30,560
I keep hearing from the audiences that 
it's hilarious.

812
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,810
I've got to go.
I got to see him.

813
00:34:32,811 --> 00:34:36,660
I got to see Daniel Tosh.
6 million people.

814
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:37,910
It's too many.
Damn it,

815
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:39,440
son.
Too many good for him,

816
00:34:39,441 --> 00:34:40,370
man.
You don't need all that.

817
00:34:40,590 --> 00:34:41,780
Yeah,
he deserves it.

818
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:44,030
He deserves it.
He's fucking funny.

819
00:34:44,031 --> 00:34:44,930
God,
I want a couple.

820
00:34:45,470 --> 00:34:50,470
Yeah,
we've got to figure out how to get you 

821
00:34:50,470 --> 00:34:50,470
some go to figure out.
Hey,

822
00:34:50,470 --> 00:34:50,990
look serious.

823
00:34:50,990 --> 00:34:52,670
It's fucking awesome.
I love serious.

824
00:34:52,671 --> 00:34:55,610
I love the,
the high definition sound.

825
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:57,380
The,
the music is in.

826
00:34:57,530 --> 00:35:02,530
I mean,
it sounds really good when it comes 

827
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:02,530
through satellite.
It doesn't sound like a radio.

828
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:02,670
It sounds.
It sounds.

829
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:08,180
Yeah.
It's much better than radio sound and 

830
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:08,300
it's coming from the fucking sky.
I totally support that.

831
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:11,150
You know,
I love the fact that I can just click on

832
00:35:11,151 --> 00:35:14,150
classic vinyl and then I hear,
uh,

833
00:35:14,170 --> 00:35:16,190
you know,
on the road again by Bob Seger,

834
00:35:16,191 --> 00:35:16,670
you know,
like,

835
00:35:16,730 --> 00:35:18,260
Oh yeah,
you know,

836
00:35:18,430 --> 00:35:20,420
it's like,
it's worth it to me.

837
00:35:20,421 --> 00:35:22,190
It's totally worth it.
I love that.

838
00:35:22,210 --> 00:35:23,240
You know,
you guys are on.

839
00:35:23,241 --> 00:35:25,700
I listened to Howard still at listened 
to.

840
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:26,530
Um,
uh,

841
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:28,890
I listened to Ron and Fez.
It's,

842
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:34,120
it's totally worth it to me.
But the Internet is the future and 

843
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:39,670
somehow know the Internet is going to 
get into people's cars and when that 

844
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:41,400
happens,
when that happens,

845
00:35:41,401 --> 00:35:42,750
it's going to be real hard.

846
00:35:42,810 --> 00:35:45,160
It's like,
it's going to be real hard to,

847
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:47,430
to sell Internet radio,
right?

848
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,230
It's going to just have to be 
advertising base,

849
00:35:49,310 --> 00:35:54,310
like podcasts are.
They're going to have to change their 

850
00:35:54,310 --> 00:35:56,421
business model to make money a different
way because you're not going to go to 

851
00:35:56,421 --> 00:35:57,240
get him to fucking pay for it.
What's going to stop you?

852
00:35:57,270 --> 00:35:59,520
It's not just that they're going to stop
using it.

853
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:04,790
Like why would they use it when you have
things like spotify and all these 

854
00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:06,060
different ways of getting to tell you.
I have both right now,

855
00:36:06,061 --> 00:36:11,061
satellite radio and,
and my iphone sets up where I have 

856
00:36:11,061 --> 00:36:11,790
spotify or Pandora or anything like 
that.

857
00:36:11,791 --> 00:36:13,230
It's just easier.
Like I,

858
00:36:13,231 --> 00:36:13,840
you know,
it's,

859
00:36:13,870 --> 00:36:15,020
it's,
it's,

860
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:20,380
it's,
you still have to do shit with all the 

861
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:20,380
things that you have to type in the 
station that you want if you're using,

862
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:23,150
you know,
Pandora or have to do that.

863
00:36:23,410 --> 00:36:26,390
There's more than just turning it on and
hitting a button and that's the,

864
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:31,420
that's what's still going on.
Like I still use satellite radio more 

865
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:33,590
because I just turned it on and Bam.
Yeah,

866
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:38,600
I see what you're saying.
So there's not too many steps to go 

867
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:38,600
through steps.
Yeah.

868
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:42,261
But that's going to change and there's 
less and less and less steps are 

869
00:36:42,261 --> 00:36:46,221
happening as you go on.
The other thing is that you have to be 

870
00:36:46,221 --> 00:36:46,221
with satellite,
you know,

871
00:36:46,221 --> 00:36:48,480
you have to be in a place where you 
could see the satellite.

872
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:51,060
That's why it dies out when you go into 
bridges and shit,

873
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:56,480
that's the internet.
So the same way you go fucking 

874
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:56,480
someplaces,
you don't have any internet at all.

875
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:01,100
That's true.
So there's gonna be some places maybe 

876
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:01,100
you know.
Well,

877
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:04,940
I don't know.
It doesn't make any sense to still do 

878
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:04,940
the same thing regular radio get.

879
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:04,950
They just put receivers in the Lincoln 
tunnel and I can get fucking.

880
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:06,240
You can listen to q one.
Oh,

881
00:37:06,241 --> 00:37:11,241
four.
Three in case you haven't heard Brown 

882
00:37:11,241 --> 00:37:11,241
eyed girl.
Enough Time's gone into fucking jersey.

883
00:37:11,241 --> 00:37:13,020
Can you get a satellite radio under the 
tongue?

884
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:14,370
No,
but they could put in receivers.

885
00:37:14,371 --> 00:37:15,570
They probably don't feel it's worth it 
yet.

886
00:37:15,571 --> 00:37:17,280
I mean,
real regular radio does,

887
00:37:17,281 --> 00:37:20,230
but they don't need to do.
They must hate the Internet to see what.

888
00:37:20,290 --> 00:37:21,360
Do they hate the Internet?
No,

889
00:37:21,361 --> 00:37:22,500
I don't think so.
I mean,

890
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:23,000
uh,
they,

891
00:37:23,010 --> 00:37:28,010
they,
they understand what a promotional tool 

892
00:37:28,010 --> 00:37:29,721
it can be too.
But I mean they understand that the 

893
00:37:29,721 --> 00:37:29,721
threat.
I mean,

894
00:37:29,721 --> 00:37:29,830
it certainly is.
Once Wifi is and cars,

895
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:30,990
everything's going to be in trouble.
Well,

896
00:37:30,991 --> 00:37:35,991
the thing is when,
when serious first came out or when 

897
00:37:35,991 --> 00:37:35,991
satellite radio in general first came 
out,

898
00:37:35,991 --> 00:37:37,170
it was really like a dream come true.

899
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,430
Like,
oh my God,

900
00:37:38,431 --> 00:37:41,340
like I can get radio in my car that's 
uncensored.

901
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:46,640
Like somehow or another,
some Bozo hasn't stepped in and made it 

902
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:47,640
so that if you say the wrong fucking 
noise with your mouth,

903
00:37:47,641 --> 00:37:50,520
you get locked up in a cage and they get
to forfeit,

904
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:55,700
forfeit all your assets and that's just 
nutty shit when it comes to censorship 

905
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:58,110
that people don't understand,
like how damaging that is.

906
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,780
And in all the time that satellite radio
is bid on,

907
00:38:00,990 --> 00:38:03,570
how much different are things really?
I mean,

908
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:06,810
it's not like anybody got hurt the same 
fucking people are listening to it.

909
00:38:06,930 --> 00:38:09,690
It's not like all of a sudden you know,
you guys being completely,

910
00:38:09,691 --> 00:38:12,810
totally honest with all the words that 
you'd ever wanted to use.

911
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,310
It's not like that.
All of a sudden it started.

912
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:19,340
People were running out in the streets 
and fucking cutting off heads and 

913
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:19,500
jumping off bridges.
Nothing changed.

914
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:22,170
Nothing changed.
So therefore it's bullshit.

915
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:27,200
Therefore it's useless.
It's not like it's contributing to the 

916
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:27,200
downfall of society.
Well,

917
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,200
the FCC just lost a big case to,
for Fox.

918
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:30,390
Uh,
they lost a huge fucking case.

919
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:35,391
Mr Graham court about A.
I don't know if it was about just quick 

920
00:38:35,391 --> 00:38:35,391
utterances,
but they they,

921
00:38:35,391 --> 00:38:36,220
they removed

922
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:41,220
a lot of the fines.
I think that Fox has got thrown out 

923
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:43,011
there,
so the FCC just to go and we knew they 

924
00:38:43,011 --> 00:38:43,011
would because they're fucking greedy and
they're talking.

925
00:38:43,011 --> 00:38:47,310
They won't just lay off.
It's so creepy when they chased after 

926
00:38:47,310 --> 00:38:47,380
stern when all that shit was in the 
news,

927
00:38:47,381 --> 00:38:52,381
it was so creepy.
It felt like it felt like good against 

928
00:38:52,381 --> 00:38:52,960
evil.
That's really what it felt like.

929
00:38:52,961 --> 00:38:57,961
It felt like someone out there trying to
entertain people and he's getting 

930
00:38:58,811 --> 00:39:03,811
attacked by the manner in which he's 
entertaining is unsuitable for this 

931
00:39:03,811 --> 00:39:07,480
particular type of transmission and 
because of that,

932
00:39:07,481 --> 00:39:12,481
the federal government steps in and it's
so crazy that anybody would think that 

933
00:39:12,481 --> 00:39:17,230
that's a good idea.
It's allowed to get to be actual law and

934
00:39:17,231 --> 00:39:20,230
still reinforced and in this day and 
age,

935
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:22,900
what people like Tim Winter in the 
fucking a PTC,

936
00:39:22,901 --> 00:39:25,570
the parents television council,
they write most of the complaints.

937
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:30,750
They're the ones who do all the fucking 
complaints and the stupid fcc still 

938
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:31,510
actually takes them seriously and 
listens to them.

939
00:39:31,690 --> 00:39:36,690
It's enraging.
It's like when the Italian American 

940
00:39:36,690 --> 00:39:37,420
society or whatever the fuck it is,
was getting angry at the surprise.

941
00:39:37,690 --> 00:39:42,690
You know,
it's like just there's certain things 

942
00:39:42,690 --> 00:39:44,350
where political correctness become such 
a fucking hamper.

943
00:39:44,351 --> 00:39:47,200
Two,
a real dialogue to real conversations to

944
00:39:47,201 --> 00:39:50,230
anyone who thinks that he's being pc as 
is appropriate is a dope.

945
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:52,960
Anyone who subscribes that thinking is a
dumb motherfucker.

946
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:58,000
What you're saying that you don't think 
that people like Tony Soprano of every 

947
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,140
existed.
Do you pay attention to history?

948
00:39:59,290 --> 00:40:01,150
Like what?
Where are you getting this from?

949
00:40:01,151 --> 00:40:04,660
Stupid lucky you're going to protest the
way they're being depicted,

950
00:40:04,661 --> 00:40:09,661
being depicted the way they really are.
There's plenty of people like that that 

951
00:40:09,661 --> 00:40:13,321
are real people.
It just doesn't mean that that's all 

952
00:40:13,321 --> 00:40:13,990
Italian 20 you only protecting retards.

953
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:16,270
The only protect them,
the dopiest amongst us,

954
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:17,770
amongst us that would,
you know,

955
00:40:17,771 --> 00:40:21,280
look at all Italians as if they were all
gangsters.

956
00:40:21,281 --> 00:40:26,281
Now because of the Sopranos and why has 
nobody ever objected to a positive 

957
00:40:26,281 --> 00:40:29,911
profile?
This is why they're thinking is flawed 

958
00:40:29,911 --> 00:40:30,700
because they're saying the profiling is 
wrong and generalizing is wrong,

959
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:33,850
but they never mind when they're 
generalized positively,

960
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:39,030
they nevermind a positive profile or a 
pleasant sweeping generalization,

961
00:40:39,150 --> 00:40:42,400
so that's why they're fucking phony.
We just don't like a negative thing.

962
00:40:42,410 --> 00:40:44,710
So there's certain things they want you 
to be able to say about them and certain

963
00:40:44,711 --> 00:40:49,711
things they don't like.
You can talk all day about black guys 

964
00:40:49,711 --> 00:40:52,291
and they're big dicks and I do,
but you can't talk about them like one 

965
00:40:52,291 --> 00:40:52,760
fried chicken.
Yeah.

966
00:40:52,761 --> 00:40:54,580
That's negative.
And which is hilarious.

967
00:40:54,930 --> 00:40:56,500
Yes.
We talked about this yesterday.

968
00:40:56,530 --> 00:40:58,810
Chicken has got damn delicious and 
fucking wonderful.

969
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,910
What's wrong with being someone who's 
into chicken?

970
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:01,930
I guess maybe they just try.
Maybe.

971
00:41:01,931 --> 00:41:06,931
You know what made me black people are 
smart and they just trying to refocus 

972
00:41:06,931 --> 00:41:06,931
everybody back on the COC.
So they want all.

973
00:41:06,931 --> 00:41:10,080
They want all stereotypes.
Fried Chicken and watermelon back.

974
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:15,640
That's probably a very calculated move.
Chess move.

975
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:17,660
It's checked me from the get go.
Really?

976
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:20,590
You can't talk about their strawberry 
Soda Bitch.

977
00:41:20,591 --> 00:41:21,720
You Racist?
Yeah.

978
00:41:21,721 --> 00:41:22,630
Yeah.
Fuck functions.

979
00:41:22,631 --> 00:41:23,470
We don't enjoy them.
Well,

980
00:41:23,471 --> 00:41:26,020
what else is left?
I heard you have a huge dick word.

981
00:41:26,770 --> 00:41:28,210
Word.
Yeah.

982
00:41:28,211 --> 00:41:31,060
You know,
I was doing a tell show the uh,

983
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:34,370
will you sit down and you and dave loves
porn

984
00:41:34,490 --> 00:41:38,600
or is that what he was old Dave loves,
which is true,

985
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:41,330
which is a little bit of that too.
He's a piece of shit.

986
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:46,440
They used to come into the comedy cellar
with a fucking duffle bag of porn tapes 

987
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:46,690
because I guess he's ocd.
They want to throw him out.

988
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:48,320
He's like hair,
like you had to pass.

989
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:51,470
He couldn't bring himself to throw it 
out the fuck back.

990
00:41:51,710 --> 00:41:55,370
He needs to be roommates with Yoshi than
Yoshi.

991
00:41:55,371 --> 00:41:57,710
Sent me so much poor and I've watched so
much of it.

992
00:41:57,711 --> 00:42:02,711
I threw out.
I was cleaning out my apartment little 

993
00:42:02,711 --> 00:42:02,711
bit and I'm not exaggerating.
Probably a thousand points,

994
00:42:02,711 --> 00:42:04,830
but I just couldn't keep medical.
Yeah,

995
00:42:04,850 --> 00:42:06,020
Jo,
she's ridiculous,

996
00:42:06,021 --> 00:42:08,600
man.
Yoshi had a dude with them once.

997
00:42:08,601 --> 00:42:13,601
I forgot the guy's name,
but he got actually got upset that I 

998
00:42:13,601 --> 00:42:13,601
didn't want any.
I go,

999
00:42:13,601 --> 00:42:13,970
come on,
man.

1000
00:42:13,971 --> 00:42:14,420
Come on man.

1001
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:15,980
I'm giving these to you man.
We produce these.

1002
00:42:16,310 --> 00:42:18,110
I go do,
that's fine,

1003
00:42:18,111 --> 00:42:20,210
but thank you very much.
I prefer not to.

1004
00:42:20,211 --> 00:42:23,840
I prefer not to take it,
but it was all like keeping stuff.

1005
00:42:23,870 --> 00:42:25,400
It was all like,
like pulling.

1006
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:28,070
I don't go for the gay.
I'm not into that.

1007
00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:30,050
I don't like to look into a vagina at 
all.

1008
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:34,670
What I was going to say about Dave's 
show is that when John Holmes was on,

1009
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:39,700
I was like,
his Dick isn't even that big for 21st 

1010
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:42,740
century like today.
Like dudes have giant dicks now.

1011
00:42:42,890 --> 00:42:45,020
Like you ever seen that?
Like Lexington Steel guy?

1012
00:42:45,350 --> 00:42:47,740
Jesus Christ is Dick's like twice the 
size of John Holmes.

1013
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:52,800
Yeah.
There's a lot of guys who are getting 

1014
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:52,800
bigger.
Yes.

1015
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,530
You think it's our cell phones keeping 
your pocket?

1016
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:59,330
It's black eyes and they started first 
with pagers.

1017
00:43:00,230 --> 00:43:00,920
Yeah.
No,

1018
00:43:00,921 --> 00:43:05,921
I think it's vibrating it bigger.
I think it's like everything else is 

1019
00:43:05,921 --> 00:43:07,160
natural selection.
Well Lexington is great.

1020
00:43:07,161 --> 00:43:12,161
His Dick works too because johnny is 
always like doing like blowing his dick 

1021
00:43:12,161 --> 00:43:16,931
work.
Half the time was always kind of 

1022
00:43:16,931 --> 00:43:16,931
halfhearted.
Squeeze it at the base.

1023
00:43:16,931 --> 00:43:18,490
I don't get like a rubber snake.
Yeah,

1024
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:20,210
he's holding it tight at the fucking 
base.

1025
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:22,910
That trick that we've all pulled the 
Lexington both hands in the air.

1026
00:43:23,130 --> 00:43:25,970
We were a ginger.
Lynn was on the show and she was talking

1027
00:43:25,971 --> 00:43:26,630
about,
uh,

1028
00:43:27,030 --> 00:43:28,280
uh,
all the different.

1029
00:43:28,350 --> 00:43:33,350
I was like,
how come this dude could never get it 

1030
00:43:33,350 --> 00:43:33,350
up?
And she's like,

1031
00:43:33,350 --> 00:43:33,350
cocaine.
All these guys were on coke.

1032
00:43:33,350 --> 00:43:37,721
They couldn't get it up because you 
watch it and this poor fucking dude is 

1033
00:43:37,721 --> 00:43:38,420
like,
he just can't get hard.

1034
00:43:38,450 --> 00:43:40,160
I guess his name is Jerry Butler.

1035
00:43:40,370 --> 00:43:41,210
Oh yeah,
sure.

1036
00:43:41,211 --> 00:43:42,280
I know Jerry,
but he,

1037
00:43:42,281 --> 00:43:42,710
um,
he,

1038
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:44,660
we totally made fun of him.
And if you hear this cherry,

1039
00:43:44,661 --> 00:43:46,970
I totally apologize.
I've never done coke.

1040
00:43:46,971 --> 00:43:49,280
I'll imagine it'd be very hard to fuck 
while you're on coke.

1041
00:43:49,310 --> 00:43:51,020
So if I was making fun of young Dave 
show,

1042
00:43:51,350 --> 00:43:53,930
it's all just for comedy fellow,
one of the Dukes of hazard,

1043
00:43:53,931 --> 00:43:58,931
like he didn't warn guy.
He looked like a sweet handsome kid and 

1044
00:43:58,931 --> 00:44:00,230
his dick was average.
Like I never liked guys an average day.

1045
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:00,960
Like,
yeah,

1046
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:05,020
like beat it with that fucking thing,
that seven and a quarter.

1047
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:07,940
Fuck yourself.
You know,

1048
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:09,980
I mean I like a fucking,
I like a wrecking ball,

1049
00:44:11,510 --> 00:44:13,220
but I've gotten into the,
it's funny like the,

1050
00:44:13,430 --> 00:44:16,400
I've gotten into the fucking black and 
white porn and I never watched that,

1051
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:21,700
but I started,
I liked the amateur shit of guys just 

1052
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:21,700
filming their wires getting,
fuck man,

1053
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:21,700
I really.

1054
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:22,510
Do.
You think they're really filming?

1055
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:24,530
I was fuck,
you can always tell the difference.

1056
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:27,500
I'd say half of them are real and half 
of them are actually porn companies,

1057
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:32,680
but there are some that are absolutely 
real and you can tell because he's 

1058
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:32,680
fucking date in the corner,
you know,

1059
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:34,800
95.
There's awful music playing.

1060
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:36,180
You know what I mean?
There's always some,

1061
00:44:36,181 --> 00:44:41,181
uh,
there's something playing in the 

1062
00:44:41,181 --> 00:44:42,561
background which a porn company could 
never license whenever there's music 

1063
00:44:42,561 --> 00:44:45,981
playing.
If you hear journey playing an 

1064
00:44:45,981 --> 00:44:47,601
interracial porn,
they probably is a fucking hall moving 

1065
00:44:47,601 --> 00:44:47,601
because the porn company would never 
licensed.

1066
00:44:47,601 --> 00:44:52,130
Have a little bit.
Have you been getting into any of the 

1067
00:44:52,130 --> 00:44:52,130
CAM websites lately?
Have you been doing any of those things?

1068
00:44:52,130 --> 00:44:56,091
Never got into camp stuff.
The new ones that are free and you just 

1069
00:44:56,091 --> 00:44:56,570
there nowadays,
it's nice.

1070
00:44:56,590 --> 00:44:58,320
You might really,
really like it.

1071
00:44:58,330 --> 00:45:03,330
I'll try it is completely addicted.
Maybe you should not steer a little 

1072
00:45:03,330 --> 00:45:05,310
jimmy into this whole endeavor.
Maybe ruin his life.

1073
00:45:05,810 --> 00:45:07,480
My Free Cams Dot com.
Check it out.

1074
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:10,640
It's just tons and tons and tons of 
girls.

1075
00:45:10,641 --> 00:45:15,641
Just normal girls.
They have like jobs at applebee's and 

1076
00:45:15,641 --> 00:45:17,991
stuff like just fucking sitting there 
fucking shoving dildos in their ass and 

1077
00:45:17,991 --> 00:45:19,830
then like if you hate them a little 
extra and then they'll go into a private

1078
00:45:19,831 --> 00:45:24,831
room.
But my favorite thing is spying on 

1079
00:45:24,831 --> 00:45:26,760
privates.
You can pay a little extra and spy on 

1080
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:26,760
what the private rooms looks.
Looks.

1081
00:45:26,770 --> 00:45:28,150
Isn't that ridiculous?
Because that's like,

1082
00:45:28,170 --> 00:45:31,000
how is that private key?
You can't buy on the Guy Right now.

1083
00:45:31,060 --> 00:45:36,060
No,
you can't see her fucking playing with 

1084
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:39,140
Twila.
The fact he gave an awful job like 

1085
00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:40,810
applebee's.
Well she shouldn't be shoving something 

1086
00:45:40,810 --> 00:45:40,810
into a squat with that fucking Gig.
Nine to five.

1087
00:45:40,810 --> 00:45:42,600
I wonder how many girls are doing that?

1088
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:44,970
Can you.
You can do screen captures,

1089
00:45:44,971 --> 00:45:45,610
right?
If you want it.

1090
00:45:45,630 --> 00:45:46,500
Last night we,
uh,

1091
00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:48,660
entered on a podcast I did with the bone
zone.

1092
00:45:48,661 --> 00:45:53,661
We interviewed one of the girls,
really skyped her while she was in the 

1093
00:45:53,661 --> 00:45:55,090
room and talk to her.
And uh,

1094
00:45:55,260 --> 00:46:00,260
so that was,
that's the thing we're going to start 

1095
00:46:00,260 --> 00:46:01,731
doing now.
More Death Squad is actually talking to 

1096
00:46:01,731 --> 00:46:01,731
these girls.
There's something about that website.

1097
00:46:01,731 --> 00:46:05,910
My Free Cams when you first showed me,
it really kind of freaked me out because

1098
00:46:06,270 --> 00:46:09,930
I really had this impression of the 
future.

1099
00:46:10,230 --> 00:46:15,230
I really had this idea of what this is 
really going to be because you click on 

1100
00:46:15,230 --> 00:46:18,480
this thing and it opens up.
It looks like infinite windows.

1101
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:19,530
It's like,
where are these?

1102
00:46:19,531 --> 00:46:22,560
Like these little universes,
like what is this?

1103
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:27,800
And each one of them you click on and 
it's a different girl connected to the 

1104
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:30,180
Internet doing these little shows and 
there's fucking hundreds of them.

1105
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:31,620
And you're looking at this.
I'm like,

1106
00:46:31,621 --> 00:46:35,250
this is kind of nuts.
What a weird interface this is.

1107
00:46:35,430 --> 00:46:39,750
All these chicks are facing high 
themselves and Dildos and,

1108
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:40,650
and you,
you know,

1109
00:46:40,651 --> 00:46:42,840
you can give them money and tune in.
It's like,

1110
00:46:42,841 --> 00:46:45,270
what the fuck is going on?
Well,

1111
00:46:45,271 --> 00:46:46,210
it's amazing.
It's,

1112
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:48,600
it's a great advancement,
but what's going to happen is eventually

1113
00:46:48,601 --> 00:46:53,601
privacy will be a thing of it,
and I'm not even saying that's a bad 

1114
00:46:53,601 --> 00:46:55,560
thing because we're all going to be 
locked in on the same mentality.

1115
00:46:55,561 --> 00:46:57,880
We're all going to be,
and I'm not even saying it's going to be

1116
00:46:57,881 --> 00:47:02,881
a terrible thing.
We're all going to be on the same wave 

1117
00:47:02,881 --> 00:47:03,120
length mentally.
Eventually the Internet's a great start,

1118
00:47:03,121 --> 00:47:08,121
but fast forward 100 years from now,
you're gonna be punished for bad 

1119
00:47:08,121 --> 00:47:08,310
thoughts as opposed to bad speech or bad
actions.

1120
00:47:08,311 --> 00:47:13,311
People gonna know when you think 
something because we're already working 

1121
00:47:13,311 --> 00:47:15,321
on that which Stephen Hawkings,
so we're all going to see each other 

1122
00:47:15,321 --> 00:47:15,321
sexually.
We're all going to know everything about

1123
00:47:15,321 --> 00:47:17,700
each other and eventually it's going to 
lose its effect.

1124
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:22,880
The dopamine drip won't work.
We're going to figure out a better way 

1125
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:25,311
to get people feel.
You know that feeling you get when 

1126
00:47:25,311 --> 00:47:26,991
you're fucking crank into your edging.
We're going to find out better ways to 

1127
00:47:26,991 --> 00:47:26,991
give people that so the sexual loses its
appeal.

1128
00:47:26,991 --> 00:47:31,940
Anyway.
This we're in a great time right now if 

1129
00:47:31,940 --> 00:47:31,940
a pervert because this

1130
00:47:31,940 --> 00:47:32,410
will eventually go away.
It's going to get worse,

1131
00:47:33,060 --> 00:47:36,970
but how has that been true when there's 
so much porn online?

1132
00:47:36,971 --> 00:47:40,320
Is that ever going to go with.
How do you think that's going to go with

1133
00:47:40,390 --> 00:47:41,080
porn?
Do for you?

1134
00:47:41,230 --> 00:47:42,790
Porn makes us.
It turns us on.

1135
00:47:42,791 --> 00:47:47,791
It's all these opportunities.
It releases something in the brain when 

1136
00:47:47,791 --> 00:47:51,781
eventually they figure out get that in a
pill or even through an electrical 

1137
00:47:51,781 --> 00:47:54,420
impulse or a panel that you won't.
Corn Patch,

1138
00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:59,700
get a porn past badge and you'd go and 
you'd get a patch and you don't want to 

1139
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:00,230
come anymore.
Well,

1140
00:48:00,231 --> 00:48:05,231
nobody would take that option,
but you might though because it would 

1141
00:48:05,231 --> 00:48:05,370
keep you from cheating on your wife.
It will keep you from getting aids.

1142
00:48:05,371 --> 00:48:08,200
That would keep you from knocking 
somebody up like the benefits for it.

1143
00:48:08,201 --> 00:48:09,400
Let's do it.
If I could take one of those,

1144
00:48:09,401 --> 00:48:14,401
the amount of hours I sleep better when 
I'm jerking off course or if you don't 

1145
00:48:14,401 --> 00:48:17,750
have keeps me up,
but there's a lot of people that feel 

1146
00:48:17,750 --> 00:48:17,770
like life connects them to them.

1147
00:48:17,770 --> 00:48:21,640
Being direct or them being aroused or 
them being,

1148
00:48:21,641 --> 00:48:23,980
you know,
in having sex with someone,

1149
00:48:24,250 --> 00:48:29,250
they feel like they're not.
They're not alive unless that's 

1150
00:48:29,250 --> 00:48:29,250
happening.
So if you cut,

1151
00:48:29,250 --> 00:48:30,880
if you took a pill that would like do 
that,

1152
00:48:30,940 --> 00:48:33,580
would it stop your ability to do it 
naturally?

1153
00:48:33,581 --> 00:48:35,160
You wouldn't be able to.
What'd you just.

1154
00:48:35,290 --> 00:48:38,050
You wouldn't want to have sex anymore.
You just want the pill.

1155
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:43,080
You still want sex,
but I think it would take away the drug 

1156
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:43,080
part of it.
Eventually we're going to find a way to.

1157
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:46,210
It's almost like with the same thing as 
with alcohol and drugs and overeating.

1158
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:49,480
All of that will eventually be fixed 
because whatever the brain is doing that

1159
00:48:49,481 --> 00:48:54,481
makes you high or makes you feel great,
they'll figure out a way to make 

1160
00:48:54,481 --> 00:48:57,780
everybody feel like that all the time.
People won't even need to go out and 

1161
00:48:57,780 --> 00:49:01,801
look for that because we'll all be able 
to access that feeling whenever we want 

1162
00:49:01,801 --> 00:49:01,801
in the next.

1163
00:49:01,801 --> 00:49:02,620
What is it?
Quote unquote acceptable way.

1164
00:49:02,710 --> 00:49:07,710
Yeah.
We're in a weird period right now when 

1165
00:49:07,710 --> 00:49:09,601
it comes to things that they give people
when they have mental illnesses or what 

1166
00:49:09,601 --> 00:49:14,101
they perceive to be mental illnesses or 
depression because I have friends that 

1167
00:49:14,101 --> 00:49:17,881
have taken all sorts of different stuff 
and I'm like well how does the doctor 

1168
00:49:17,881 --> 00:49:18,370
know what to give you?
And it's like,

1169
00:49:18,371 --> 00:49:23,371
well they start you on one thing and 
we'll see how you react to that and you 

1170
00:49:23,371 --> 00:49:28,071
know,
if you go to the doctor and say well I 

1171
00:49:28,071 --> 00:49:28,090
can't get it up anymore and I'm,
I'm really listless throughout the day.

1172
00:49:28,091 --> 00:49:33,091
And then they try something else and 
they keep switching medications until 

1173
00:49:33,091 --> 00:49:33,091
they find one that works for you.
Right.

1174
00:49:33,390 --> 00:49:34,780
And I'm like,
what?

1175
00:49:35,260 --> 00:49:36,850
Like how,
how crazy is that?

1176
00:49:36,851 --> 00:49:41,851
Like they've got a,
a bunch of different medications and 

1177
00:49:41,851 --> 00:49:42,130
they just try them out on you nice and 
slow.

1178
00:49:42,130 --> 00:49:47,130
Like how much do they vary and how do 
you not you sure you got it nailed with 

1179
00:49:47,130 --> 00:49:49,120
this one and what do we take in here?
What's going on?

1180
00:49:49,180 --> 00:49:51,670
I'm up in the air and that stuff.
I think it does work for some people for

1181
00:49:51,671 --> 00:49:53,140
sure.
I wouldn't have thought of taking it,

1182
00:49:53,141 --> 00:49:56,080
but I'm afraid of my creativity being 
fucked with because I probably depressed

1183
00:49:56,081 --> 00:49:57,550
all the time and it's like,
it's stupid.

1184
00:49:57,551 --> 00:50:02,551
I think I'd rather not be.
So if I can take a pill to kind of 

1185
00:50:02,551 --> 00:50:02,551
balanced out whatever is wrong in my 
stupid brain.

1186
00:50:02,590 --> 00:50:04,410
Do you think um,
it is a,

1187
00:50:04,420 --> 00:50:09,420
um,
like a pattern thing or do you think 

1188
00:50:09,420 --> 00:50:11,941
it's a chemical thing?
Like when you feel like you're 

1189
00:50:11,941 --> 00:50:11,941
depressed,
you do,

1190
00:50:11,941 --> 00:50:15,211
you connect it to a certain pattern of 
thinking that become self destructive 

1191
00:50:15,211 --> 00:50:17,350
and you're just real comfortable going 
down this pattern?

1192
00:50:17,530 --> 00:50:20,470
Or do you connect it to a actual.
Do you feel like man,

1193
00:50:20,471 --> 00:50:22,810
there's something wrong with the 
chemicals my brain is making?

1194
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:25,900
Or are they even indecipherable?
Are they the same thing?

1195
00:50:25,901 --> 00:50:27,560
Do they create each other?
I think,

1196
00:50:27,561 --> 00:50:30,890
I think it's a little bit of everything.
Like I think it could be a chemical,

1197
00:50:30,891 --> 00:50:33,260
but the chemical combined with just 
shitty thinking.

1198
00:50:33,261 --> 00:50:36,800
It's comfortable thinking you get used 
to like whenever things are good for me,

1199
00:50:37,010 --> 00:50:39,200
I start to think like horribly 
depressing thoughts.

1200
00:50:39,201 --> 00:50:44,201
Like I just,
I don't think I deserve it or whatever 

1201
00:50:44,201 --> 00:50:44,201
that nonsense is,
but I think it's a combination,

1202
00:50:44,201 --> 00:50:48,430
but I know chemical is a part of it 
because I feel it like I don't sleep 

1203
00:50:48,430 --> 00:50:52,031
well and I just feel fucking like thick 
and sludgy and fogged all the time and I

1204
00:50:52,821 --> 00:50:55,520
fucking hate it.
I guarantee you that's the sleep apnea.

1205
00:50:56,220 --> 00:51:01,220
We were talking about this and I told 
you that your mouthpiece wasn't the one 

1206
00:51:01,671 --> 00:51:04,380
that I use.
I use this one by this guy named Ian.

1207
00:51:04,460 --> 00:51:09,460
Dr Crowe pen from Tarzana and he's 
developed a mouthpiece that it has 

1208
00:51:09,460 --> 00:51:12,830
almost like a finger that keeps your 
tongue from falling back over,

1209
00:51:12,831 --> 00:51:13,250
uh,
your,

1210
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:15,290
your wind hole.
That's where.

1211
00:51:15,340 --> 00:51:20,340
What were you getting?
No sleep apnea is your fucking fat 

1212
00:51:20,340 --> 00:51:23,141
tongue.
Likewe collapses while you're lying on 

1213
00:51:23,141 --> 00:51:23,680
your back and literally covers your air 
hole.

1214
00:51:23,890 --> 00:51:28,890
It's just a shitty design in the human 
face and some of us have it and some 

1215
00:51:28,890 --> 00:51:31,400
people don't.
Well you have obstructive.

1216
00:51:31,430 --> 00:51:36,430
I don't even know if I have obstructive 
or a combination of obstructive and 

1217
00:51:36,430 --> 00:51:36,800
central where central is when your brain
doesn't send the signal.

1218
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:38,720
Like I think that's what it's called.
Like when I've,

1219
00:51:38,750 --> 00:51:40,730
because I've woken up at times and just 
got.

1220
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:45,760
You haven't breathed like breathing.
You're not like not I'm trying to 

1221
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:49,301
breathe,
but I have not attempted a breath and I 

1222
00:51:49,301 --> 00:51:51,210
know I'll miss a couple of cycles and I 
wake up panicking and uh,

1223
00:51:51,211 --> 00:51:56,211
I think I might have part of that too 
because the mouthpiece I have I sleep a 

1224
00:51:56,211 --> 00:51:56,211
little better with.
It does help.

1225
00:51:56,570 --> 00:51:58,640
But I don't know if it's totally an 
obstructive apnea thing.

1226
00:51:58,820 --> 00:52:03,650
I actually woke the guy up on the plane 
coming back from Brazil.

1227
00:52:04,130 --> 00:52:04,810
Uh,
yeah.

1228
00:52:05,100 --> 00:52:09,020
I remember just being horrible Joe.
I remember like being on a plane next to

1229
00:52:09,021 --> 00:52:10,400
you and just being like,
what the fuck?

1230
00:52:10,401 --> 00:52:13,220
That's not normal.
But now even like it was that bad.

1231
00:52:13,221 --> 00:52:14,010
But no,
my,

1232
00:52:14,110 --> 00:52:16,190
I snored real bad,
real bad.

1233
00:52:16,191 --> 00:52:19,970
But what I'm saying is I saw a guy 
having sleep apnea and I,

1234
00:52:19,971 --> 00:52:20,750
I,
it was hidden.

1235
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:24,230
He was a big guy and so I went to the 
flight attendant and I'm like,

1236
00:52:24,231 --> 00:52:27,650
this guy goes for like these stretches 
where he's not breathing,

1237
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:29,570
right?
Like it was a long stretch.

1238
00:52:29,571 --> 00:52:34,571
There were like 20,
25 seconds with no breathing and he see 

1239
00:52:34,571 --> 00:52:34,610
him struggle and struggle and then.

1240
00:52:39,050 --> 00:52:41,690
And then he would close it up again and 
I was like,

1241
00:52:41,691 --> 00:52:43,190
wow,
that guy is going to die.

1242
00:52:43,430 --> 00:52:46,850
Like you can't keep doing that.
Like that's real bad sleep apnea.

1243
00:52:46,851 --> 00:52:51,851
I didn't know what it looked like to 
watch someone like choke and gasp for 

1244
00:52:51,851 --> 00:52:55,010
air and then then like his chest wasn't 
moving.

1245
00:52:55,390 --> 00:52:56,480
He was like,
like what?

1246
00:52:56,481 --> 00:53:01,481
Little wiggles with his chest,
but no breathing and then all sudden 

1247
00:53:01,481 --> 00:53:04,460
look like big swallowing and gasping.
So this guy's getting no sleep.

1248
00:53:04,461 --> 00:53:07,550
If he sleeps like this every night he 
gets no fucking sleep.

1249
00:53:07,910 --> 00:53:08,510
So I'm like,
dude,

1250
00:53:08,511 --> 00:53:10,300
you can get a heart attack from this for
real.

1251
00:53:10,301 --> 00:53:15,301
This is,
you need to do something about this 

1252
00:53:15,301 --> 00:53:15,301
Llama Basil.
It's hard for me to fall asleep.

1253
00:53:15,301 --> 00:53:19,270
It's not anything.
It's hard for me to stay asleep like 

1254
00:53:19,270 --> 00:53:19,270
I've had to get up and paid because 
I've,

1255
00:53:19,270 --> 00:53:22,040
I've had had to go to the bathroom and 
then somebody said that that's sometimes

1256
00:53:22,041 --> 00:53:27,041
your mind wakes you up thinking that 
like you're not going to breathe so it 

1257
00:53:27,041 --> 00:53:27,720
wakes you up to piss because that will 
get you up.

1258
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:29,760
It's a really weird signalling.
Your body will send,

1259
00:53:29,761 --> 00:53:30,560
like,
it'll make you feel.

1260
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:33,570
You have to Piss.
That's worried about your control.

1261
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:38,600
Yeah.
Which shows you like our priorities are 

1262
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:38,600
like,
I can't,

1263
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:38,600
I can't breathe on my own,
but I have to piss all.

1264
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:39,450
Jump up and I'll take a,
you see,

1265
00:53:40,350 --> 00:53:43,470
this guy didn't say woke him up.
I woke him up.

1266
00:53:43,980 --> 00:53:46,060
He woke up rather when he saw the,
uh,

1267
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:51,120
the flight attendant and me like 
watching him maybe like sense that we 

1268
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:55,271
were.
Maybe it wasn't sleeping anyway because 

1269
00:53:55,271 --> 00:53:55,271
he was snoring so loud.
But um,

1270
00:53:55,271 --> 00:53:55,540
he,
uh,

1271
00:53:55,620 --> 00:54:00,620
he had no idea.
He had no idea when I was told that I 

1272
00:54:00,620 --> 00:54:00,620
had sleep apnea,
you know,

1273
00:54:00,620 --> 00:54:01,450
when I went to way,
uh,

1274
00:54:01,460 --> 00:54:02,110
I had,
you know,

1275
00:54:02,220 --> 00:54:07,220
I knew that I had snored,
but when I went to an actual place or 

1276
00:54:07,220 --> 00:54:07,500
they monitor,
like when you go to sleep,

1277
00:54:07,590 --> 00:54:09,300
right to do that with you?

1278
00:54:09,370 --> 00:54:14,370
Yeah.
But I get to take home and they say I 

1279
00:54:14,370 --> 00:54:14,370
definitely had not the worst apnea,
but the next 100.

1280
00:54:14,370 --> 00:54:17,730
Oh my God.
Just like what are the worst.

1281
00:54:17,731 --> 00:54:20,430
I wouldn't have fallen asleep in a place
like that where you able to fall asleep.

1282
00:54:20,610 --> 00:54:25,610
It was real hard for a different level.
You're covered with these fucking 

1283
00:54:25,610 --> 00:54:25,980
electronics can do that.
It was really hard,

1284
00:54:25,981 --> 00:54:28,410
but I was so tired.
I made sure that I got.

1285
00:54:28,411 --> 00:54:30,030
I showed up.
They're really tired.

1286
00:54:30,270 --> 00:54:31,830
But man,
I just smoked first.

1287
00:54:32,010 --> 00:54:32,750
No,
no,

1288
00:54:32,790 --> 00:54:33,990
just,
just went.

1289
00:54:34,050 --> 00:54:34,440
Oh,
okay.

1290
00:54:34,441 --> 00:54:37,050
Because I don't smoke before I go to 
sleep usually.

1291
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:38,130
No,
no.

1292
00:54:38,330 --> 00:54:41,520
I spoke before.
I write small before I do Jujitsu.

1293
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:43,350
Oh Wow.
So that.

1294
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:44,960
I'm very surprised here.
Yeah.

1295
00:54:44,961 --> 00:54:49,961
No,
that's the best way to do Jiu Jitsu 

1296
00:54:49,961 --> 00:54:49,961
because you're more relaxed,
more focused.

1297
00:54:49,961 --> 00:54:51,090
They know this,
first of all,

1298
00:54:51,091 --> 00:54:55,170
the type of pot that I smoke is a,
there's two types of two different types

1299
00:54:55,171 --> 00:54:55,590
of pot.

1300
00:54:55,660 --> 00:55:00,660
One is called Endeca and one's called 
Sativa and Indica is the stuff that 

1301
00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:02,490
people get that makes you like,
it's almost like a narcotic.

1302
00:55:02,550 --> 00:55:04,710
It's like you could collapse into the 
couch.

1303
00:55:04,711 --> 00:55:08,140
It's just like more of like a sedative,
more of like a,

1304
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:11,190
it makes you kind of feel like just at 
ease,

1305
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:15,000
chill and relaxed.
And it's great for like pain.

1306
00:55:15,001 --> 00:55:19,410
It's great for sex.
But Sativa is the stuff that I liked and

1307
00:55:19,411 --> 00:55:22,550
that's more speedy.
It's more um,

1308
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:24,060
sort of,
um,

1309
00:55:24,150 --> 00:55:26,860
it feels like it accelerates your 
thinking and makes you,

1310
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:31,140
it makes you think about crazy shit.
Like the best thing for me is sativa and

1311
00:55:31,141 --> 00:55:33,340
like a Carl Sagan documentary,
you know,

1312
00:55:33,620 --> 00:55:35,100
you just go,
what the fuck?

1313
00:55:35,101 --> 00:55:40,101
And you listened to the Carl Sagan 
explaining the universe and it's just 

1314
00:55:40,561 --> 00:55:41,490
like,
it's,

1315
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:43,530
you know,
it's the perfect pot for thinking.

1316
00:55:43,650 --> 00:55:48,650
He wrote a community,
a communion with communion and I was 

1317
00:55:48,650 --> 00:55:48,650
contacted,
Jodie foster.

1318
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:49,980
He wrote,
yeah,

1319
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:52,050
that was a great fucking moving.
That was,

1320
00:55:52,051 --> 00:55:53,400
to this day,
still holds up,

1321
00:55:53,470 --> 00:55:58,470
watched it the other day.
It's one of those things where you're 

1322
00:55:58,470 --> 00:55:58,470
like,
oh yeah,

1323
00:55:58,470 --> 00:56:00,741
that's probably how it would actually 
happen when she's going through and the 

1324
00:56:00,741 --> 00:56:00,780
fucking warm haul.
It all kind of feels right.

1325
00:56:00,781 --> 00:56:04,650
It doesn't feel cheesy or Hokey at all.
It's look system.

1326
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:06,960
I mean,
we were talking about this yesterday.

1327
00:56:06,961 --> 00:56:09,370
I had the guy from ancient aliens on and
uh,

1328
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:10,430
we were talking about,
uh,

1329
00:56:10,450 --> 00:56:13,740
the possibilities of a Ufo was like 
that,

1330
00:56:13,770 --> 00:56:18,770
like what the they had in contact.
That doesn't seem outside the realm of 

1331
00:56:18,770 --> 00:56:21,270
what we're capable of and 30 years or 50
years or 100 years.

1332
00:56:21,290 --> 00:56:23,010
I mean,
if you asked me could we come up?

1333
00:56:23,110 --> 00:56:24,250
Something like that.
If we lived

1334
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:25,540
a thousand years,
I'd be like,

1335
00:56:25,570 --> 00:56:26,500
fucking,
of course we could.

1336
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:27,550
You have.
I interviewed Bernie,

1337
00:56:27,850 --> 00:56:28,240
I think.
Wait,

1338
00:56:28,241 --> 00:56:29,170
no,
Ray Kurzwell.

1339
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:30,160
No.
I know.

1340
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:33,490
We had them on want and he's kind of a 
dry guy,

1341
00:56:33,491 --> 00:56:38,491
but he's a real genius.
And he talks about how technology is 

1342
00:56:38,491 --> 00:56:41,101
advancing exponentially.
Like we're doubling our knowledge and 

1343
00:56:41,101 --> 00:56:43,501
doubling and doubling or knowledge and 
he thinks there's going be a point of 

1344
00:56:43,501 --> 00:56:46,021
singularity,
but we just know everything as it 

1345
00:56:46,021 --> 00:56:48,571
happened.
Where are we will catch up because the 

1346
00:56:48,571 --> 00:56:48,571
way technology age,
our brain,

1347
00:56:48,571 --> 00:56:49,750
like once we can incorporate something 
like Google,

1348
00:56:49,910 --> 00:56:51,160
you'll just think of something and know 
it.

1349
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:52,630
You won't need to Google it.
You'll.

1350
00:56:52,980 --> 00:56:57,980
He was a genius and I think his time 
frame is off because he thinks that in 

1351
00:56:57,980 --> 00:57:01,951
40 years we're going to have singularity
and I think he thinks that because he 

1352
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:04,801
wants to stay alive,
but he talks about immortality and 

1353
00:57:04,801 --> 00:57:04,801
uploading.

1354
00:57:04,801 --> 00:57:07,950
Once we understand how the electrical 
impulses can be uploaded to a hard 

1355
00:57:07,950 --> 00:57:07,950
drive.
He's a fascinating guy.

1356
00:57:07,950 --> 00:57:09,160
Yeah.
I've read a bunch of stuff.

1357
00:57:09,190 --> 00:57:09,670
Oh,
you have?

1358
00:57:09,671 --> 00:57:10,420
Okay.
I'm explaining to them,

1359
00:57:10,421 --> 00:57:11,920
you know,
I'd love that document.

1360
00:57:11,921 --> 00:57:14,380
It's good to.
For people to hear that documentary,

1361
00:57:14,410 --> 00:57:15,820
the transcendent man.
Yeah.

1362
00:57:15,940 --> 00:57:18,190
That's a fucking amazing documentary.
Really,

1363
00:57:18,220 --> 00:57:23,220
really interesting.
It was really interesting to see the 

1364
00:57:23,220 --> 00:57:26,490
different points of view.
The people who are really optimistic 

1365
00:57:26,490 --> 00:57:29,791
about intelligence that is artificially 
created and people who are terrified of 

1366
00:57:29,791 --> 00:57:30,580
it,
but some of those guys that were like,

1367
00:57:30,581 --> 00:57:32,260
you don't understand.
Like if this happens,

1368
00:57:32,380 --> 00:57:37,380
like the one guy that was calling it an 
artilect who was the English guy who's 

1369
00:57:37,380 --> 00:57:37,600
talked about our telex.
I don't know.

1370
00:57:37,601 --> 00:57:38,830
I don't know if I saw this special.
I've just.

1371
00:57:38,831 --> 00:57:40,840
I've just read some of the stuff that 
will.

1372
00:57:40,841 --> 00:57:45,841
They had a bunch of different people 
that are experts on this idea of 

1373
00:57:45,841 --> 00:57:49,060
artificial intelligence becoming 
sentient and one of them was like,

1374
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:50,860
fucking,
we're going to get wiped out.

1375
00:57:51,070 --> 00:57:56,070
One of them was like,
this guy's like all terminator doom and 

1376
00:57:56,070 --> 00:57:58,651
gloom.
Like we don't even know what's going to 

1377
00:57:58,651 --> 00:58:00,541
happen.
And with the real worry is that if they 

1378
00:58:00,541 --> 00:58:03,151
fuck around and like program emotions 
and jealousy and rage into a computer 

1379
00:58:03,151 --> 00:58:07,950
thinking that they have to do this in 
order to really truly replicate a human 

1380
00:58:07,950 --> 00:58:10,660
being instead of replicating someone 
completely creepy with no emotions.

1381
00:58:10,870 --> 00:58:15,870
I mean,
if they're going to make an artificial 

1382
00:58:15,870 --> 00:58:17,191
person,
wouldn't they make an artificial person 

1383
00:58:17,191 --> 00:58:17,191
that has human characteristics so it 
would blend in.

1384
00:58:17,191 --> 00:58:21,960
So then what if that fucking thing is,
this artificial computer can actually 

1385
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:25,891
make a better artificial computer that a
human can make and then it just 

1386
00:58:25,891 --> 00:58:28,360
exponentially increases in like over a 
period of like zero time.

1387
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:32,230
They've created way better human beings 
than we could've ever created.

1388
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:35,290
And that's the singularity.
And then the shit really hits the fan.

1389
00:58:35,340 --> 00:58:40,340
Well,
it wouldn't surprise me if it happens 

1390
00:58:40,340 --> 00:58:40,340
eventually because I mean again,
it's all chemical reactions,

1391
00:58:40,340 --> 00:58:40,340
anger,
rage,

1392
00:58:40,340 --> 00:58:41,860
jealousy one,
and it's all unique.

1393
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:43,630
Could probably break it down to ones and
Zeros.

1394
00:58:43,631 --> 00:58:46,270
So once they figured that out in the 
computer and they can map our DNA,

1395
00:58:46,271 --> 00:58:47,650
that stuff will definitely be a part of 
it.

1396
00:58:48,100 --> 00:58:51,220
It's going to be a weird thing that 
they're going to have to discuss.

1397
00:58:51,370 --> 00:58:56,140
Should we create like these crazy fake 
people that never get angry.

1398
00:58:56,141 --> 00:58:56,800
Maybe that's the future

1399
00:58:56,970 --> 00:58:59,010
Birdie did artificial intelligence,
like Siri,

1400
00:58:59,011 --> 00:59:04,011
it's like meeting series,
like a girl he met at a coffee shop 

1401
00:59:04,011 --> 00:59:06,551
briefly and then in like 10 or 15 years 
we're going to actually see her in a 

1402
00:59:06,551 --> 00:59:06,551
different form,
you know,

1403
00:59:06,551 --> 00:59:10,811
a little older.
And then one day we're gonna be fucking 

1404
00:59:10,811 --> 00:59:10,811
Siri if you think about it.
She's,

1405
00:59:10,811 --> 00:59:11,960
she's the star of artificial 
intelligence.

1406
00:59:11,961 --> 00:59:14,220
I Hate Siri.
I fucking hate it.

1407
00:59:14,310 --> 00:59:17,610
I'd still worst I try to.
I try to talk with it and just go back.

1408
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:18,260
Donk,
Donk,

1409
00:59:18,261 --> 00:59:18,620
donk,
donk,

1410
00:59:18,621 --> 00:59:19,970
donk.
It just fucking mocked me.

1411
00:59:20,090 --> 00:59:21,950
I can never get Siri work.
Yeah,

1412
00:59:21,951 --> 00:59:22,100
I'm

1413
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:23,010
not a fan of it.
I,

1414
00:59:23,050 --> 00:59:23,870
I,
you know,

1415
00:59:23,890 --> 00:59:26,300
I forgot about it and I started using it
again and it was like,

1416
00:59:26,330 --> 00:59:27,830
oh yeah,
this is totally helpful.

1417
00:59:27,980 --> 00:59:30,920
I liked the call feature can say called 
Norton,

1418
00:59:31,130 --> 00:59:33,830
calling north reading text messages when
you're driving.

1419
00:59:33,831 --> 00:59:34,610
That's awesome.
Yeah,

1420
00:59:34,611 --> 00:59:39,611
I don't do that.
I Made Sam father listen to me fucking 

1421
00:59:39,611 --> 00:59:39,680
dirty talk somebody through Syria.
I was afraid to do it,

1422
00:59:39,681 --> 00:59:41,680
so I was driving and dirty talking to 
chicken.

1423
00:59:41,690 --> 00:59:43,760
It actually came out pretty good,
but it was weird.

1424
00:59:43,761 --> 00:59:48,761
They have a guy here that you know,
you have to correct it because it's 

1425
00:59:48,761 --> 00:59:48,761
saying it wrong or whatever.
That's hilarious.

1426
00:59:48,761 --> 00:59:51,440
Driving dirty,
talking in a text through Siri.

1427
00:59:51,890 --> 00:59:55,010
It seems like that's an extra activity 
of the future.

1428
00:59:55,130 --> 00:59:56,570
It's hard.
It's a hard drug to break,

1429
00:59:56,571 --> 01:00:01,571
man.
The fucking the dirty talk to texting 

1430
01:00:01,571 --> 01:00:05,261
the fucking that whole keep it going and
have a bunch of those little windows 

1431
01:00:05,261 --> 01:00:05,600
open and just go to it and go to it and 
go to it.

1432
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:08,090
It's so hard to fucking break that.
It's really difficult.

1433
01:00:08,120 --> 01:00:10,550
She just enjoy the banter puck.
I love it.

1434
01:00:10,970 --> 01:00:12,760
I love it more than actually fucking 
really.

1435
01:00:13,100 --> 01:00:18,100
What is it about just the excitement of 
knowing someone's into you and they 

1436
01:00:18,100 --> 01:00:20,030
respond to you and it just gets kind of 
freaky and then you're like,

1437
01:00:20,031 --> 01:00:22,640
how far is this going to go and Holy 
Shit.

1438
01:00:22,641 --> 01:00:26,750
Which she went with it and I can't 
believe she's going to put it in my ass.

1439
01:00:26,780 --> 01:00:28,600
What?
Oh my God.

1440
01:00:28,601 --> 01:00:31,140
And her saying that to me in my ass.
Right.

1441
01:00:31,190 --> 01:00:31,660
Okay.
Yeah,

1442
01:00:31,670 --> 01:00:34,740
no her saying that to you straight me 
right now is my Dick,

1443
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:37,070
you know,
like whoa.

1444
01:00:37,430 --> 01:00:39,770
I liked the idea of it,
but I liked the high of it.

1445
01:00:40,050 --> 01:00:41,840
Um,
it fucking is the end of it.

1446
01:00:41,841 --> 01:00:43,160
It's like going to sleep after you've 
been drinking.

1447
01:00:43,210 --> 01:00:47,330
You want to just keep the rush going,
keep the high going and once you fucking

1448
01:00:47,331 --> 01:00:49,100
comments over once you blow your load.

1449
01:00:49,220 --> 01:00:54,220
I've actually had escorts were,
I haven't blown a load because they 

1450
01:00:54,220 --> 01:00:54,410
weren't the perfect one and I waited 
till later that night.

1451
01:00:54,411 --> 01:00:59,300
Just completed diction man.
Have you had him Roy before Jimmy?

1452
01:00:59,630 --> 01:01:01,550
No,
I got a little bit of a Roy.

1453
01:01:01,580 --> 01:01:03,440
Not too bad.
Um,

1454
01:01:03,470 --> 01:01:08,470
which is a shame because my ex wanted to
fuck me with the strap on and I would 

1455
01:01:08,470 --> 01:01:10,070
have let her,
but I will just flow really well without

1456
01:01:10,071 --> 01:01:15,071
a doubt.
So you still have a pretty butthole 

1457
01:01:15,071 --> 01:01:16,871
then?
Like you don't have any fucking war 

1458
01:01:16,871 --> 01:01:16,871
damage?
No,

1459
01:01:16,871 --> 01:01:16,871
it's nice.
It's actually not bad at all.

1460
01:01:16,871 --> 01:01:21,110
I really had almost nothing in my ass.
A lot of tongues because it's very 

1461
01:01:21,110 --> 01:01:21,370
hairless.
Very rarely has any odor.

1462
01:01:21,371 --> 01:01:23,960
My ass is phenomenal.
When it comes to that shit with odor,

1463
01:01:24,110 --> 01:01:26,930
I very rarely is it gold bond.
I don't sweat it.

1464
01:01:26,970 --> 01:01:29,150
How many times have you had a girl use a
strap on on?

1465
01:01:29,150 --> 01:01:30,940
You know,
I've had a couple of tribe.

1466
01:01:30,941 --> 01:01:32,780
My ex girlfriend tried,
she was a trooper,

1467
01:01:33,410 --> 01:01:34,820
but I would always go like,
ah,

1468
01:01:35,210 --> 01:01:37,920
and I got maybe the helmet and I could 
never get more than that.

1469
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:40,760
I felt like I had to shell when the 
girls doing that,

1470
01:01:40,761 --> 01:01:44,380
is she doing it because it turns her on 
or she's doing that because like,

1471
01:01:44,450 --> 01:01:46,010
it's fun.
Like what,

1472
01:01:46,030 --> 01:01:51,030
what is she doing?
Is She just made she sticking something 

1473
01:01:51,030 --> 01:01:51,560
inside you that she can't even feel.
But she's feeling the power of it.

1474
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:56,760
So sure.
It's like to somebody like when you 

1475
01:01:56,760 --> 01:01:56,760
spank somebody,
it turns you on,

1476
01:01:56,760 --> 01:01:57,770
but it doesn't turn you on because 
there's a sensation on your hand.

1477
01:01:57,920 --> 01:01:59,570
It's the fucking sound.
It's the,

1478
01:01:59,980 --> 01:02:01,280
it's the representation.
Oh,

1479
01:02:01,281 --> 01:02:03,320
you spank a girl.
It's all that stuff.

1480
01:02:03,321 --> 01:02:08,321
The domination of it.
That's how I think he feels when she's 

1481
01:02:08,321 --> 01:02:08,321
fucking you with a strap on.

1482
01:02:08,321 --> 01:02:08,321
Whoa.
Um,

1483
01:02:08,390 --> 01:02:09,860
and I never actually,
I wish I could do it.

1484
01:02:09,950 --> 01:02:11,480
I'm a fucking dirt bag.
I would love it,

1485
01:02:11,481 --> 01:02:13,800
but I can't get through it.
I haven't tried it alone.

1486
01:02:13,850 --> 01:02:18,850
Time.
It's the female version of the bank 

1487
01:02:18,850 --> 01:02:18,850
then?
I think so,

1488
01:02:18,850 --> 01:02:20,310
yeah.
I mean I like a woman can dominate me,

1489
01:02:20,340 --> 01:02:23,090
but properly not fucking cornball,
you know,

1490
01:02:23,170 --> 01:02:24,720
get on your knees.
Slave.

1491
01:02:26,350 --> 01:02:30,300
There are their hack and there's all,
most of them are hacks.

1492
01:02:30,450 --> 01:02:35,450
But a girl who knows not to wear 
deodorant and just put her fucking 

1493
01:02:35,450 --> 01:02:35,880
armpit over my face.
That's a chick that can fucking own me.

1494
01:02:38,450 --> 01:02:41,070
You date,
like a lot of foreign women rush.

1495
01:02:43,020 --> 01:02:45,320
I've had Indian Pussy.
I don't talk about it like food.

1496
01:02:46,170 --> 01:02:48,580
So he said it.
Got To link any food.

1497
01:02:49,090 --> 01:02:51,100
I don't like Canadian plus either.
No,

1498
01:02:51,180 --> 01:02:52,200
I don't.
It's the fucking,

1499
01:02:52,201 --> 01:02:57,201
as far as Canada is an okay country.
But I've every Canadian pussy I've ever 

1500
01:02:57,201 --> 01:03:00,621
gotten a hold of fucking reeked.
I've never had a Canadian pussy that I 

1501
01:03:00,621 --> 01:03:02,060
didn't have to fucking back off.
I wonder,

1502
01:03:02,100 --> 01:03:06,870
is it like maple syrup or what is just 
an odd sour fucking.

1503
01:03:07,140 --> 01:03:12,140
I don't know what it is and he's a 
fucking 12 hour drive or it's the 

1504
01:03:12,140 --> 01:03:15,140
fucking that will water or there's 
something chemically different about 

1505
01:03:15,140 --> 01:03:15,140
them.
I just don't enjoy it.

1506
01:03:15,140 --> 01:03:19,360
Something in their climate or something.
Maybe some of the hottest girls on the 

1507
01:03:19,360 --> 01:03:19,360
planet.
They're from Canada.

1508
01:03:19,360 --> 01:03:20,450
They are lovely.
But you know,

1509
01:03:20,490 --> 01:03:23,060
I got cockies not too long ago by some 
Canadian stripper.

1510
01:03:23,220 --> 01:03:27,360
So do you like you hold a grudge for all
Canadians because this one girl,

1511
01:03:27,460 --> 01:03:30,150
not my role.
Anti Canadian Pussy.

1512
01:03:30,280 --> 01:03:31,500
That's been a few girls.
Believe me,

1513
01:03:31,530 --> 01:03:33,150
I,
I tried the theory.

1514
01:03:33,151 --> 01:03:35,490
I never just go with one bad one because
it could have been period.

1515
01:03:35,491 --> 01:03:37,440
Like I don't like armpits.
If a girl has a period period,

1516
01:03:37,441 --> 01:03:42,441
pitzer fucking humanist girls.
You are an expert in how girls armpits 

1517
01:03:42,441 --> 01:03:44,370
smell differently during their period 
with girlfriends.

1518
01:03:44,371 --> 01:03:46,170
At least I can tell.
Once you know somebody chemically,

1519
01:03:46,171 --> 01:03:47,330
man,
you can tell by their scent.

1520
01:03:47,340 --> 01:03:50,130
Like we did a contest in Cleveland and I
got most of them right.

1521
01:03:50,430 --> 01:03:52,620
But you can tell if it's an annuity,
fucking smell.

1522
01:03:52,621 --> 01:03:55,110
She's probably on a rag in.
Her body's just expelling everything.

1523
01:03:56,470 --> 01:03:59,070
That shit was amazing.
It's just depends on your diet though.

1524
01:03:59,150 --> 01:04:00,180
A part of it does.
Yeah.

1525
01:04:00,181 --> 01:04:05,181
But if you have a consistency and the 
fucking something about that fucking 

1526
01:04:05,181 --> 01:04:05,530
smell it.

1527
01:04:05,820 --> 01:04:10,820
But again,
it can't be that fucking oniony pit 

1528
01:04:10,820 --> 01:04:12,951
odor.
But if you have a good chemistry with 

1529
01:04:12,951 --> 01:04:14,811
somebody,
there's something about that that makes 

1530
01:04:14,811 --> 01:04:14,811
me crazy.
Men.

1531
01:04:14,811 --> 01:04:17,460
And do you like bio or do you like Geo 
Obo?

1532
01:04:17,690 --> 01:04:19,470
But it puts.
I liked the mouth to be clean.

1533
01:04:19,530 --> 01:04:21,360
I want her mouth the face clean.
Um,

1534
01:04:21,361 --> 01:04:23,160
I don't want to fuck it.
He just to smell waxy.

1535
01:04:23,161 --> 01:04:24,570
I don't want her belly button.
This stink.

1536
01:04:25,720 --> 01:04:29,040
The feet can smell a little bit.
Honest to God.

1537
01:04:29,041 --> 01:04:34,041
I liked that a little bit and a little 
bit of a fucking little sweaty and the 

1538
01:04:34,441 --> 01:04:36,570
ass can smell a little bit and the pussy
a little bit.

1539
01:04:36,571 --> 01:04:41,370
As long as it's not fucking checklist,
I swear to God.

1540
01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:45,610
Deniro face on where you go to this 
checklist.

1541
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:47,310
Okay,
good.

1542
01:04:47,380 --> 01:04:49,380
I had the.
ASCE has a certain level,

1543
01:04:49,381 --> 01:04:52,970
it can go to a little bit of a fucking 
lie yourself a little bit.

1544
01:04:53,350 --> 01:04:58,350
Just a little bit.
The as what is the particular smile 

1545
01:04:58,350 --> 01:04:58,590
that's acceptable?
Is there a level?

1546
01:04:58,680 --> 01:05:00,570
It's like they say about pornography.
I don't know what A.

1547
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:01,860
I can't describe it.
I know what I see it.

1548
01:05:01,861 --> 01:05:03,630
That's the way it is with an asshole.
It's like I,

1549
01:05:03,631 --> 01:05:06,150
I.
It has a slight asshole smell to it.

1550
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:08,160
Like a must.
It's fun.

1551
01:05:08,940 --> 01:05:12,300
It's nice.
What is that all law about obscenity.

1552
01:05:12,301 --> 01:05:14,070
How do you define upset?
And He that was the.

1553
01:05:14,071 --> 01:05:15,690
That's the question that a lot of 
trials,

1554
01:05:15,691 --> 01:05:16,140
right?
Well,

1555
01:05:16,141 --> 01:05:17,980
community standards and this is why it's

1556
01:05:18,010 --> 01:05:23,010
in trouble and by the way,
I would love to know where all like the 

1557
01:05:23,010 --> 01:05:25,891
fucking libertarian political 
organizations where when Max hardcore 

1558
01:05:25,891 --> 01:05:26,140
went to jail for four years because they
nailed him when he,

1559
01:05:26,141 --> 01:05:31,141
when he mailed stuff to fucking Tampa 
because Florida stinkers type of stuff 

1560
01:05:31,141 --> 01:05:33,340
and they trapped them and got them on 
some obscene community standards thing,

1561
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:35,550
but when we wizard but he's sticking up 
for Max hardcore.

1562
01:05:35,560 --> 01:05:38,050
This guy did for years for adult 
pornography.

1563
01:05:38,380 --> 01:05:40,570
It's fucking adults.
There was no children involved.

1564
01:05:40,590 --> 01:05:45,590
It seems really strange that you could 
have something that is not illegal.

1565
01:05:46,990 --> 01:05:50,050
That is obviously it's marketable,
I mean,

1566
01:05:50,051 --> 01:05:52,300
whether or not it's healthy to watch 
that kind of shit.

1567
01:05:52,540 --> 01:05:57,540
It's obviously people are watching it 
and there is always that argument that 

1568
01:05:57,540 --> 01:06:01,561
certain types of depravity keeps people 
from committing things in the real life 

1569
01:06:01,561 --> 01:06:03,430
that they can get through it in some 
sort of a fantasy form and it keeps them

1570
01:06:03,431 --> 01:06:04,560
from being a creep or,
uh,

1571
01:06:04,570 --> 01:06:06,430
a violent person in their real life.

1572
01:06:07,060 --> 01:06:09,640
And if some of the signs of fucking 
waiver man and what,

1573
01:06:09,641 --> 01:06:14,641
where do you cross the line?
Where do you decide that this is 

1574
01:06:14,641 --> 01:06:17,371
something that this guy needs to get 
locked in a cage for because you don't 

1575
01:06:17,371 --> 01:06:20,491
agree with the whole country is full of 
shit when it comes to free speech and 

1576
01:06:20,491 --> 01:06:20,620
free thought because all of us,
and I mean,

1577
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:23,170
well I shouldn't say all ideologies,
liberal and conservative,

1578
01:06:23,171 --> 01:06:28,171
haven't asked her as like,
you're free to say this and do this as 

1579
01:06:28,171 --> 01:06:28,171
long as you.
And,

1580
01:06:28,171 --> 01:06:32,690
and for the liberals it's what they call
hate speech and anything that's racial 

1581
01:06:32,690 --> 01:06:32,890
or homophobia.
And for the conservatives,

1582
01:06:33,100 --> 01:06:33,460
it's,
hey,

1583
01:06:33,461 --> 01:06:37,210
don't fuck with God and country,
but both sides are equally phony when it

1584
01:06:37,211 --> 01:06:38,740
comes to like,
when's the last time,

1585
01:06:39,070 --> 01:06:44,070
uh,
like a feminist stuck up for a guy who 

1586
01:06:44,070 --> 01:06:47,881
said something about women that was 
unpleasant because he has the right to 

1587
01:06:47,881 --> 01:06:47,890
say it never.

1588
01:06:48,190 --> 01:06:49,270
Like,
where were all these people?

1589
01:06:49,271 --> 01:06:54,271
When Tracy Morgan said what he said,
why didn't nobody who didn't like him 

1590
01:06:54,271 --> 01:06:58,171
stick up for all countries for it's just
like they don't have that much 

1591
01:06:58,171 --> 01:07:02,431
resources.
So it's not like they can jump into the 

1592
01:07:02,431 --> 01:07:04,741
fray for any little situation.
They don't have that much time when 

1593
01:07:04,741 --> 01:07:06,640
you're running some sort of an 
organization that's looking for violence

1594
01:07:06,641 --> 01:07:08,980
against women or anything,
but you don't have,

1595
01:07:09,040 --> 01:07:11,170
you have to look at concentrate only on 
that.

1596
01:07:11,171 --> 01:07:14,050
I,
I don't fault them for going after,

1597
01:07:14,170 --> 01:07:16,750
you know,
or not going after cases where guys like

1598
01:07:16,751 --> 01:07:21,751
Tracy Morgan got busted or now they only
have a certain amount of things they 

1599
01:07:21,751 --> 01:07:21,751
want to concentrate on.
But no,

1600
01:07:21,751 --> 01:07:25,500
I mean I fault them for going after him 
because he was like,

1601
01:07:25,501 --> 01:07:27,010
why don't like when people went after 
him,

1602
01:07:27,011 --> 01:07:28,600
why didn't they just stick up for them 
and go,

1603
01:07:28,601 --> 01:07:31,570
we don't like what he said,
but he's got the right to say it.

1604
01:07:31,630 --> 01:07:33,400
There should be no penalty for it.
That's what I mean.

1605
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:35,860
And none of these groups,
which would take them two seconds to put

1606
01:07:35,861 --> 01:07:38,260
out that fucking memo,
but glad has never done it.

1607
01:07:38,410 --> 01:07:39,590
None of them have done it.
No,

1608
01:07:39,591 --> 01:07:44,591
they no,
they don't devote any resources to 

1609
01:07:44,591 --> 01:07:46,561
helping anybody else out there develop 
resources to pushing their ideology and 

1610
01:07:46,561 --> 01:07:50,050
their ideology is that this guy needs to
be punished because if he's punished and

1611
01:07:50,051 --> 01:07:55,051
it cost him a lot of money,
then people are going to stop thinking 

1612
01:07:55,051 --> 01:07:57,241
like that.
You're gonna stop expressing themselves 

1613
01:07:57,241 --> 01:07:59,221
like that,
which I can see their point it up to a 

1614
01:07:59,221 --> 01:08:00,460
certain point where you got to realize,
is it okay?

1615
01:08:01,060 --> 01:08:02,200
Where does this,
where does this,

1616
01:08:02,500 --> 01:08:05,740
where's this line happened?
Is it okay for Denzel Washington to play

1617
01:08:05,741 --> 01:08:08,560
a murderer and a gangster and a movie?
It is,

1618
01:08:08,561 --> 01:08:09,760
right.
Okay.

1619
01:08:09,970 --> 01:08:14,970
Why is it not okay for Tracy Morgan to 
portray a guy who's pretending that he 

1620
01:08:15,591 --> 01:08:16,160
would stab

1621
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:18,950
his son if he was gay?
Because he's not telling the truth.

1622
01:08:19,050 --> 01:08:19,670
He's,
he's,

1623
01:08:19,790 --> 01:08:24,790
he's obviously doing a character that is
like completely over the top and says 

1624
01:08:24,790 --> 01:08:26,210
ridiculous shit all the time.
That his.

1625
01:08:26,360 --> 01:08:27,800
That's his shtick.
Oh,

1626
01:08:27,801 --> 01:08:29,750
by the way,
I was incorrect when I apologize.

1627
01:08:29,751 --> 01:08:31,400
You just straighten me out.
When I said the women's groups,

1628
01:08:31,401 --> 01:08:33,050
I should have said the gay groups.
I was thinking that it was.

1629
01:08:33,051 --> 01:08:35,450
Tracy said something that was anti 
woman.

1630
01:08:35,451 --> 01:08:37,450
I forgot that it was that.
I actually forgot what I just went.

1631
01:08:37,470 --> 01:08:42,470
Remember the conflict?
I'm saying why doesn't the group was 

1632
01:08:42,470 --> 01:08:42,470
saying that gay dudes are women.
Um,

1633
01:08:42,470 --> 01:08:43,130
so all the great ones are.
I mean,

1634
01:08:43,131 --> 01:08:46,040
let's be honest,
who hasn't seen a transexual and fall in

1635
01:08:46,041 --> 01:08:48,320
love with them on.
It's an open society folks.

1636
01:08:48,380 --> 01:08:51,230
Yeah.
I think Tracy got to.

1637
01:08:51,800 --> 01:08:54,770
People have to understand that it was 
people that want to see him do that.

1638
01:08:55,280 --> 01:08:57,320
You might not like it,
but it's like dice.

1639
01:08:57,380 --> 01:08:59,450
I'd love dice.
I've always loved dice.

1640
01:08:59,451 --> 01:09:04,451
I want to see him go fucking bananas.
It's a form of entertainment and if he 

1641
01:09:04,451 --> 01:09:05,000
does it about Italians,
which I am,

1642
01:09:05,180 --> 01:09:06,350
I will.
I will laugh.

1643
01:09:06,410 --> 01:09:07,990
I will laugh along with it because I 
know,

1644
01:09:07,991 --> 01:09:09,320
you know,
if he's making fun of us,

1645
01:09:09,321 --> 01:09:11,780
it's mostly true shit,
you know,

1646
01:09:11,781 --> 01:09:16,781
but for whatever reason,
some people want to pretend that you 

1647
01:09:16,781 --> 01:09:17,390
know,
some of his ridiculous over the top.

1648
01:09:17,391 --> 01:09:21,020
Stereotypes aren't funny.
It's hilarious character.

1649
01:09:21,170 --> 01:09:24,800
This character will fucking.
I'd love it.

1650
01:09:24,801 --> 01:09:29,801
It's great entertainment.
I swallow my load yet chew it takes that

1651
01:09:30,471 --> 01:09:32,480
seriously.
Why would you be angry?

1652
01:09:32,481 --> 01:09:33,200
This guy?
Why?

1653
01:09:33,230 --> 01:09:34,910
I mean it's.
This is just a.

1654
01:09:34,940 --> 01:09:37,220
This is entertainment.
It's comedy and it's a.

1655
01:09:37,390 --> 01:09:40,220
it's a valid form of comedy and this is 
where it gets weird.

1656
01:09:40,221 --> 01:09:45,221
It's like when you,
when a guys creating art and believe it 

1657
01:09:45,221 --> 01:09:45,740
or not,
Tracy Morgan's creating fucking art.

1658
01:09:45,740 --> 01:09:47,360
When he gets on stage and he does stand 
up,

1659
01:09:48,860 --> 01:09:52,610
he's not trying to fucking piss people 
off.

1660
01:09:52,790 --> 01:09:55,280
He's just going with.
This is one of the.

1661
01:09:55,310 --> 01:09:59,510
This is one of the styles of comedy.
You say completely outrageous shit.

1662
01:09:59,511 --> 01:10:04,511
We all know guys who would sit like 
Brian Holtzman is one of my perfect 

1663
01:10:04,511 --> 01:10:04,511
examples.
Brian,

1664
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:08,690
he did a joke about Susan Smith after,
after,

1665
01:10:08,691 --> 01:10:10,730
uh,
Susan Smith got caught drowning.

1666
01:10:11,420 --> 01:10:13,550
He goes on stage like two days later and
he goes,

1667
01:10:13,910 --> 01:10:16,520
this Susan Smith case,
she'd drawn a kids.

1668
01:10:16,521 --> 01:10:18,290
Yeah,
I heard those were bad kids.

1669
01:10:18,890 --> 01:10:22,310
I heard they sat that close to the TV.
They always spelt the fucking milk.

1670
01:10:22,311 --> 01:10:24,860
They don't put away that blocks.
Those kids will not be met.

1671
01:10:25,790 --> 01:10:30,410
And we were laughing and gasping the 
whole audience.

1672
01:10:30,411 --> 01:10:32,780
It was a combination of laughs and 
gasps.

1673
01:10:33,110 --> 01:10:36,410
And that's a valid piece of art.
That's a valid piece of art.

1674
01:10:36,440 --> 01:10:40,100
He doesn't really mean that he isn't.
If he had to choose,

1675
01:10:40,160 --> 01:10:45,160
he would say yes,
please go back in time and stop her 

1676
01:10:45,160 --> 01:10:45,160
before she tells her children he's a 
character.

1677
01:10:45,160 --> 01:10:48,440
He's playing a crazy accentuated 
character.

1678
01:10:48,441 --> 01:10:52,340
He gets into a zone and he does this,
this thing onstage and he says like,

1679
01:10:52,341 --> 01:10:56,330
really offensive shit and it's fucking 
funny and I enjoy it.

1680
01:10:56,390 --> 01:11:01,270
It's art or even when you're just being 
yourself and exploring a ridiculous sap,

1681
01:11:01,580 --> 01:11:04,190
but we never.
People never stick up for that,

1682
01:11:04,191 --> 01:11:09,191
and the same people that would defend 
maple thorp or any other form of art 

1683
01:11:09,191 --> 01:11:13,360
piss Christ and a jar are the same.
There's the same mentality that will 

1684
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:15,080
attack tracy or that will attack a,
um,

1685
01:11:15,320 --> 01:11:16,350
uh,
I missed what he said,

1686
01:11:16,351 --> 01:11:17,040
or Michael.
Richard.

1687
01:11:17,130 --> 01:11:20,390
It's a fraudulent stance and every side 
does it.

1688
01:11:20,391 --> 01:11:22,340
It drives me fucking crazy.
I think there's,

1689
01:11:22,350 --> 01:11:22,710
yeah.

1690
01:11:22,820 --> 01:11:27,820
Is people have this idea.
A lot of people I should say have this 

1691
01:11:27,820 --> 01:11:31,581
idea that if you don't agree with them,
you're wrong and your,

1692
01:11:31,601 --> 01:11:32,260
your,
your,

1693
01:11:32,270 --> 01:11:33,050
uh,
if you're,

1694
01:11:33,060 --> 01:11:34,290
uh,
you're against them.

1695
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:39,320
You don't.
It's not like you can enjoy different 

1696
01:11:39,320 --> 01:11:41,541
things or have different ideas about 
different standards of living and what 

1697
01:11:41,541 --> 01:11:41,541
you shouldn't,
shouldn't be able to do.

1698
01:11:41,541 --> 01:11:42,210
No,
it's not that.

1699
01:11:42,211 --> 01:11:47,211
It's.
If you don't agree you're wrong and 

1700
01:11:47,211 --> 01:11:47,910
people have to understand that different
people like different shit.

1701
01:11:47,960 --> 01:11:52,960
Right?
And you can't force someone to not like 

1702
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:56,420
porn.
You can't force someone to say you're 

1703
01:11:56,420 --> 01:11:56,420
not gay.
You know,

1704
01:11:56,420 --> 01:11:56,850
you cannot be gay.
We're not.

1705
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:58,650
You can't do that.
It doesn't work.

1706
01:11:58,920 --> 01:12:03,920
Like you have to let people do whatever 
the fuck they want to do and then you 

1707
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:03,920
just got to kind of accept that that's 
them.

1708
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:05,730
And I wish a lot of these phony artists,
like I say,

1709
01:12:05,810 --> 01:12:10,810
following meaning singers,
I think that they're hit by attacking 

1710
01:12:10,810 --> 01:12:10,810
Christianity.

1711
01:12:10,810 --> 01:12:10,910
Like I have no profit attack.
Christianity finally.

1712
01:12:10,980 --> 01:12:15,980
Sure it's right there,
but it's like none of them address 

1713
01:12:15,980 --> 01:12:18,801
Islam.
None of them addressed the fact that 

1714
01:12:18,801 --> 01:12:21,621
they're afraid to attack is.
And that's what drives me crazy because 

1715
01:12:21,621 --> 01:12:22,200
it's this fucking fake edge.
It's the,

1716
01:12:22,201 --> 01:12:24,540
it's this fucking fake.
I'm being dangerous.

1717
01:12:24,720 --> 01:12:29,720
But it's really,
they're looking both ways before they 

1718
01:12:29,720 --> 01:12:31,581
cross the street and they're acting like
they just bolted out the front door and 

1719
01:12:31,581 --> 01:12:31,800
it fucking drives me.
It drives me nuts.

1720
01:12:32,280 --> 01:12:33,720
Yeah,
it's the,

1721
01:12:33,780 --> 01:12:36,720
there's a certain amount of posturing 
that people,

1722
01:12:36,721 --> 01:12:41,721
uh,
people get into when they start talking 

1723
01:12:41,721 --> 01:12:41,970
about certain political issues and 
certain things,

1724
01:12:42,090 --> 01:12:47,090
certain ideologies.
And it gets to that gross place where 

1725
01:12:47,090 --> 01:12:49,140
people just start clapping and you can 
tell they're disingenuous and it just,

1726
01:12:49,310 --> 01:12:51,960
there were milking off this thing for 
their own ego.

1727
01:12:52,290 --> 01:12:57,290
They're milking off this reality for 
their own ego instead of just sort of 

1728
01:12:57,290 --> 01:12:57,290
trying to,
you know,

1729
01:12:57,290 --> 01:12:59,340
trying to look at the big picture 
because the big.

1730
01:13:00,270 --> 01:13:05,270
I mean you're absolutely right.
Why doesn't anybody want to make fun of 

1731
01:13:05,270 --> 01:13:05,270
Islam?
I'll tell you why.

1732
01:13:05,270 --> 01:13:06,340
Because they'll fucking kill you.
Yeah.

1733
01:13:06,341 --> 01:13:08,790
Like they took shit to an entirely 
different place.

1734
01:13:09,390 --> 01:13:12,060
And so anybody who wants to pretend to 
be edgy,

1735
01:13:12,270 --> 01:13:14,760
it doesn't involve going that far.
I mock them,

1736
01:13:14,761 --> 01:13:16,820
but I mean I can,
I'm careful where I put the joe come out

1737
01:13:16,850 --> 01:13:17,880
an idiot,
you know?

1738
01:13:17,881 --> 01:13:22,881
I mean I'm not crazy though.
You right now just admitted to self 

1739
01:13:22,881 --> 01:13:24,210
censorship for the same thing.
You just find it more reasonable because

1740
01:13:24,211 --> 01:13:26,400
you say that your take on it as well.
You know,

1741
01:13:26,401 --> 01:13:27,520
I'll take it back a little bit.
You know,

1742
01:13:27,540 --> 01:13:32,540
as far as I'm sure,
but you are clearly saying that you 

1743
01:13:32,540 --> 01:13:32,730
wouldn't say what you'd normally would 
want to say because they're dangerous.

1744
01:13:32,790 --> 01:13:37,790
Sure.
But I will say that that's why I'm not 

1745
01:13:37,790 --> 01:13:37,790
saying it isn't that amazing.

1746
01:13:37,790 --> 01:13:41,330
It's a terrifying thing in 2012 that we 
still have a faction of our world that 

1747
01:13:41,761 --> 01:13:44,430
you have to literally can't draw their 
guy,

1748
01:13:44,490 --> 01:13:47,840
but I also won't say other things 
onstage for feeling like,

1749
01:13:47,850 --> 01:13:48,540
you know what I mean?
It's like,

1750
01:13:48,541 --> 01:13:50,550
you know,
niggers a rough word to pull out.

1751
01:13:50,551 --> 01:13:52,080
You better have a reason.
Yes.

1752
01:13:52,260 --> 01:13:54,000
For you say that on stage.
You can't just go out and.

1753
01:13:54,001 --> 01:13:55,680
I would never say it in anger at 
somebody,

1754
01:13:56,860 --> 01:14:01,860
but it's like every.
Everything has lines and stuff and 

1755
01:14:01,860 --> 01:14:04,770
reasons I don't say it and I do self 
center and I think we all do as comics 

1756
01:14:04,770 --> 01:14:04,770
you,
you have to.

1757
01:14:04,770 --> 01:14:07,130
We're not crazy,
but I never want people to panelize when

1758
01:14:07,131 --> 01:14:08,410
they don't.
That's the difference.

1759
01:14:08,440 --> 01:14:08,980
Yeah.
Well it's,

1760
01:14:09,470 --> 01:14:11,920
it's really crazy when you get to like 
these

1761
01:14:12,190 --> 01:14:17,190
guys that were American Muslim converts 
that were publicly online calling for 

1762
01:14:19,151 --> 01:14:22,810
the death of Matt stone and Trey Parker 
for doing unc.

1763
01:14:22,811 --> 01:14:27,811
My drawing of Mohamad no matter which 
side of it,

1764
01:14:28,780 --> 01:14:30,960
you'd probably not even allowed to do 
that if I said that,

1765
01:14:30,961 --> 01:14:32,970
that that's probably like,
hey,

1766
01:14:33,190 --> 01:14:38,190
some sort of a thing for Bloomberg was 
sell on the money too because when they 

1767
01:14:40,421 --> 01:14:44,170
found that car bomb in time square,
Mike Bloomberg right on it,

1768
01:14:44,171 --> 01:14:44,980
he comes out.
He goes,

1769
01:14:45,190 --> 01:14:47,130
well,
let's not jump to conclusions.

1770
01:14:47,320 --> 01:14:52,320
How do you know it's not somebody 
against healthcare be and because we 

1771
01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:56,611
live in America in 2011 dummy and we 
know it's somebody from Islam we know 

1772
01:14:56,611 --> 01:14:56,611
and we will.
Right?

1773
01:14:57,190 --> 01:14:59,230
It's a weird thing that that's going on 
right now.

1774
01:14:59,290 --> 01:15:01,090
It's a weird thing when you watch like,
um,

1775
01:15:01,390 --> 01:15:06,390
any of the videos,
videos of like the real extremists in 

1776
01:15:06,390 --> 01:15:09,931
different parts of the world and see 
women wearing burkas and you realize 

1777
01:15:09,931 --> 01:15:10,090
this is all going on in the age of the 
Internet.

1778
01:15:10,410 --> 01:15:11,650
You know,
the whole world.

1779
01:15:11,651 --> 01:15:14,920
It's like this is not,
it's not worked out yet.

1780
01:15:15,090 --> 01:15:17,350
This is,
this is clearly not worked out yet.

1781
01:15:17,380 --> 01:15:18,340
Well,
it's changing.

1782
01:15:18,341 --> 01:15:23,341
I mean,
and we think it's changing and he's 

1783
01:15:23,341 --> 01:15:23,341
like,
well,

1784
01:15:23,341 --> 01:15:23,341
facebook for Christ sake.
I mean,

1785
01:15:23,341 --> 01:15:26,251
look at the Egypt,
they overthrew the government and what 

1786
01:15:26,251 --> 01:15:28,021
did they do?
They like the Muslim Brotherhood wants 

1787
01:15:28,021 --> 01:15:28,021
Sharia law.
Like it kind of feels like a circle.

1788
01:15:28,021 --> 01:15:29,020
Yeah,
that seems crazy.

1789
01:15:29,021 --> 01:15:30,280
It's like,
all right guys,

1790
01:15:30,310 --> 01:15:32,350
really say what you're going to do.
I just,

1791
01:15:32,580 --> 01:15:37,180
I got to stand against you when you want
to kill people for drawing teddy bears,

1792
01:15:37,700 --> 01:15:39,280
because that's what the Muhammad thing 
was,

1793
01:15:39,281 --> 01:15:40,630
right?
He was in a teddy bear suit.

1794
01:15:41,400 --> 01:15:42,070
I.
Come on,

1795
01:15:42,071 --> 01:15:42,940
man.
Really?

1796
01:15:43,060 --> 01:15:48,060
You can't even draw a teddy bear irony.
Kind of fucking religion is.

1797
01:15:48,670 --> 01:15:50,860
You guys aren't.
You don't have enough love going on.

1798
01:15:50,890 --> 01:15:55,890
The only way you would have this idea in
your head that you should die if you 

1799
01:15:55,890 --> 01:15:57,130
draw a fucking teddy bear is if you need
a hug.

1800
01:15:57,130 --> 01:15:59,110
Man.
I didn't draw my eyes with your bond.

1801
01:15:59,111 --> 01:16:01,300
It just for the record.
I did not draw that picture.

1802
01:16:01,690 --> 01:16:04,450
Photo photo.
It's not depiction.

1803
01:16:04,630 --> 01:16:06,790
Nobody thinks that was Mohammed.
It's Mas.

1804
01:16:06,850 --> 01:16:11,850
Yeah.
Even the Islams wouldn't kill you too 

1805
01:16:11,850 --> 01:16:13,591
stupid.
They're probably just fucking Islamic 

1806
01:16:13,591 --> 01:16:13,591
terrorists.
Yeah,

1807
01:16:13,591 --> 01:16:15,070
though.
Let's go see how great would it be if we

1808
01:16:15,071 --> 01:16:17,340
got killed,
but not just to kind of follow.

1809
01:16:17,410 --> 01:16:19,300
I'm kidding.
Jesus.

1810
01:16:19,540 --> 01:16:21,310
There you will be performing with him 
tonight.

1811
01:16:21,660 --> 01:16:22,240
I'll.
Are you really?

1812
01:16:22,720 --> 01:16:27,720
Yeah.
We're doing a show with him at the Ice 

1813
01:16:27,720 --> 01:16:27,720
House.
Am I said Hi.

1814
01:16:27,720 --> 01:16:27,720
Oh No,
no monster.

1815
01:16:27,720 --> 01:16:28,780
Probably forever.
He's a good guy.

1816
01:16:28,810 --> 01:16:30,670
I like him a lot.
He's an awesome guy.

1817
01:16:30,700 --> 01:16:33,040
He's like enormous in the Persian 
community.

1818
01:16:33,041 --> 01:16:33,580
Right?
Isn't he?

1819
01:16:33,581 --> 01:16:35,260
Like,
he performed a superstar.

1820
01:16:35,261 --> 01:16:40,261
I think he performs in Dubai and all 
these like places that I probably 

1821
01:16:40,261 --> 01:16:44,641
couldn't survive.
Meaning just because not survive 

1822
01:16:44,641 --> 01:16:47,041
physically,
but just the language would be too 

1823
01:16:47,041 --> 01:16:47,041
strong.

1824
01:16:47,041 --> 01:16:47,041
He can go overseas and do these gigs and
uh,

1825
01:16:47,041 --> 01:16:47,530
yeah,
he's huge in that community.

1826
01:16:47,560 --> 01:16:48,780
Yeah,
you could get in trouble.

1827
01:16:48,781 --> 01:16:50,560
It was it.
How sparks that was saying that,

1828
01:16:50,561 --> 01:16:52,780
uh,
he almost got arrested in Dubai.

1829
01:16:52,781 --> 01:16:54,440
Was it a house party?
She had that whole story where.

1830
01:16:54,620 --> 01:16:55,410
Yeah.
Yeah.

1831
01:16:55,420 --> 01:16:57,580
That was how right I was for some 
reason.

1832
01:16:57,620 --> 01:16:59,890
I confused that store with him and 
someone else.

1833
01:16:59,891 --> 01:17:01,330
I don't know why,
but yeah,

1834
01:17:01,331 --> 01:17:02,050
he,
uh,

1835
01:17:02,140 --> 01:17:03,710
probably Bert Kreischer.
No,

1836
01:17:03,790 --> 01:17:05,890
I.
Who Do I always confuse it with?

1837
01:17:06,120 --> 01:17:07,210
Hm.
I don't remember now.

1838
01:17:07,690 --> 01:17:09,410
But Anyway,
point is it's like,

1839
01:17:09,440 --> 01:17:10,040
it's real tricky

1840
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:12,710
because you can get locked in jail if 
you say the wrong thing.

1841
01:17:12,740 --> 01:17:14,930
The wrong thing in the wrong country is 
scary.

1842
01:17:14,931 --> 01:17:17,060
That's why I don't go overseas.
I mean people will say,

1843
01:17:17,061 --> 01:17:18,260
well do you want to perform and Dubai.
I'm like,

1844
01:17:18,261 --> 01:17:22,010
I couldn't because they're pretty.
They're pretty liberal in comparison,

1845
01:17:22,190 --> 01:17:23,510
but they don't,
you know.

1846
01:17:23,690 --> 01:17:24,380
I mean,
come on man.

1847
01:17:24,381 --> 01:17:29,381
It's a fucking.
That's not exactly like performing at 

1848
01:17:29,381 --> 01:17:30,710
Montreal while sparks.
It was him already.

1849
01:17:30,980 --> 01:17:32,810
If this is going to say it's either 
Eddie for you.

1850
01:17:32,870 --> 01:17:35,870
What's the first shit?
I bet if we were on twitter right now we

1851
01:17:35,871 --> 01:17:38,580
would know,
but I want to say it's Eddie now.

1852
01:17:38,600 --> 01:17:40,820
I want to say it's how sparks you think.
Sorry.

1853
01:17:40,821 --> 01:17:45,821
I think Eddie,
if it had another story that was 

1854
01:17:45,821 --> 01:17:47,531
similar,
but I don't think it was the one that 

1855
01:17:47,531 --> 01:17:47,531
we're thinking of where he was.
I got to,

1856
01:17:47,531 --> 01:17:50,710
he had a show and he did something and a
Dubai and something.

1857
01:17:52,430 --> 01:17:53,150
Oh,
right.

1858
01:17:53,390 --> 01:17:54,320
No,
I think,

1859
01:17:54,321 --> 01:17:55,130
um,
I think you're right.

1860
01:17:55,131 --> 01:17:57,420
I think it was how sparse,
but all he said was mature,

1861
01:17:57,800 --> 01:17:59,180
which I mean,
you know,

1862
01:17:59,181 --> 01:18:02,180
like a French,
the French name for Mr Israel.

1863
01:18:02,630 --> 01:18:05,970
That's what he said,
like he called the Guy Mature,

1864
01:18:06,020 --> 01:18:07,530
whatever the hell his name is and he 
had.

1865
01:18:07,540 --> 01:18:10,220
But the guy's real name was like,
he's like a chic.

1866
01:18:10,280 --> 01:18:11,930
So it's like he's like,
you know,

1867
01:18:12,470 --> 01:18:17,470
I don't know what you'd say,
but there's some sort of very ominous 

1868
01:18:17,470 --> 01:18:18,470
distinction that you have to give them,
you know what I mean?

1869
01:18:19,310 --> 01:18:20,230
Whatever it is,
you know,

1870
01:18:20,240 --> 01:18:22,490
his royal highness,
you have to say something like that.

1871
01:18:22,610 --> 01:18:25,640
You can't say mature.
So when he said that they,

1872
01:18:25,660 --> 01:18:27,920
they wanted to arrest him.
Fuck that.

1873
01:18:28,340 --> 01:18:29,870
That's it.
And that's all

1874
01:18:30,430 --> 01:18:34,570
stars are always offered to go to Dubai 
for like tons of money just for a week,

1875
01:18:34,720 --> 01:18:38,230
just go to Dubai for a week and be like 
a princess slave or something like that.

1876
01:18:38,620 --> 01:18:39,970
And then like,
like,

1877
01:18:40,410 --> 01:18:42,210
like your,
your salaries,

1878
01:18:42,300 --> 01:18:43,750
you know,
in one fucking week

1879
01:18:44,060 --> 01:18:45,740
did now,
did the sheik want them arrested?

1880
01:18:46,100 --> 01:18:46,940
Yeah.
Oh No,

1881
01:18:46,941 --> 01:18:47,450
no,
no.

1882
01:18:47,540 --> 01:18:52,540
She didn't want them arrested at all and
that's why he got away with it because 

1883
01:18:52,640 --> 01:18:56,780
the royal family was taking photos with 
them after the show and uh,

1884
01:18:56,870 --> 01:18:58,730
the police,
when the police show up,

1885
01:18:58,760 --> 01:19:00,620
they have like,
it's like a religious police.

1886
01:19:00,850 --> 01:19:03,050
Right.
And when the police showed up,

1887
01:19:03,110 --> 01:19:08,110
they released him because they said that
it was one guy's idea to arrest him and 

1888
01:19:08,110 --> 01:19:11,750
that guy was wrong because if the royal 
family had seen the show and he had said

1889
01:19:11,751 --> 01:19:12,980
something,
sack religious,

1890
01:19:13,190 --> 01:19:14,060
he would,
you know,

1891
01:19:14,090 --> 01:19:16,040
they would not be wanting to take 
pictures with him.

1892
01:19:16,070 --> 01:19:17,840
Right.
So based on the fact that this,

1893
01:19:17,900 --> 01:19:20,270
that hal didn't listen to them because 
they were saying like,

1894
01:19:20,271 --> 01:19:25,271
you wait here for the royal police or 
the whatever the fuck the police was 

1895
01:19:25,271 --> 01:19:28,001
called.
And Hal just went outside the door and 

1896
01:19:28,001 --> 01:19:28,001
started taking photos with everybody,
including the royal family.

1897
01:19:28,001 --> 01:19:32,200
And that's what saved them.
That the royal family thought it was 

1898
01:19:32,200 --> 01:19:34,421
funny because otherwise he was going to 
be going to jail on one person's 

1899
01:19:34,421 --> 01:19:34,580
recommendation.
That's how I remember the story,

1900
01:19:34,581 --> 01:19:35,190
right.
It was that.

1901
01:19:35,240 --> 01:19:39,920
How was my guy enough to me to say,
there's no way I could do a fucking show

1902
01:19:39,921 --> 01:19:44,921
there.
That's why I don't go because it scares 

1903
01:19:44,921 --> 01:19:46,751
me because you don't know all the rules.
Like I know in America I'm not going to 

1904
01:19:46,751 --> 01:19:46,751
get arrested on stage.
I know that.

1905
01:19:46,751 --> 01:19:46,970
I mean,
again,

1906
01:19:46,971 --> 01:19:51,971
as long as you're not calling for the 
place to be fucking bombed or a murder 

1907
01:19:51,971 --> 01:19:52,160
to take place,
just doing my stupid act.

1908
01:19:52,161 --> 01:19:53,900
I'm never going to go to jail.
Not here.

1909
01:19:54,140 --> 01:19:56,090
Not here in Canada.
You get in trouble though.

1910
01:19:56,270 --> 01:19:58,700
They had that fucking human rights 
commission that goes after people.

1911
01:19:58,701 --> 01:20:03,701
For the guy who had the comic,
who made fun of the lesbians and the 

1912
01:20:03,701 --> 01:20:06,251
audience who are talking and uh,
this stupid human rights commission 

1913
01:20:06,251 --> 01:20:06,251
takes aside to the fucking hecklers.

1914
01:20:06,251 --> 01:20:07,630
So crazy guys.
Well,

1915
01:20:08,100 --> 01:20:09,840
what they're saying is that what he was 
doing was like,

1916
01:20:09,841 --> 01:20:14,841
hate speech and that should be forbidden
and he shouldn't be able to do that for 

1917
01:20:14,841 --> 01:20:15,180
the stage.
But you know,

1918
01:20:15,181 --> 01:20:17,340
you don't understand if you're.
First of all,

1919
01:20:17,590 --> 01:20:18,190
we're,
we're,

1920
01:20:18,191 --> 01:20:20,730
we're talking about standup comedy,
which is an art form,

1921
01:20:20,790 --> 01:20:23,760
and we've already established that 
that's a fucking viable form of that art

1922
01:20:23,761 --> 01:20:25,950
form,
the Ultra Offensive Don rickles style.

1923
01:20:26,130 --> 01:20:31,130
It's always existed.
It's fucking hilarious when you watch a 

1924
01:20:31,130 --> 01:20:31,440
guy get dressed down in front of all 
these people because he says something,

1925
01:20:31,540 --> 01:20:32,670
it's.
It's a part of the show,

1926
01:20:32,671 --> 01:20:37,671
so when you start talking in a comedy,
show your you fucking give up all rights

1927
01:20:38,821 --> 01:20:40,020
to be offended.
Okay,

1928
01:20:40,060 --> 01:20:45,060
because you're now part of the show and 
we've got to do whatever the fuck we 

1929
01:20:45,060 --> 01:20:46,680
have to do to salvage this show for 
everyone else in the room.

1930
01:20:46,770 --> 01:20:51,770
There's 300 other people,
but because one asshole wants to get 

1931
01:20:51,770 --> 01:20:55,620
drunk and yellow and then you go after 
him or her who had whatever it is,

1932
01:20:55,621 --> 01:20:58,650
and then you're in trouble because of 
something harsh to.

1933
01:20:58,651 --> 01:21:02,460
You said to them,
they became a part of the show.

1934
01:21:02,700 --> 01:21:05,460
When you're a part of the show,
I am adlibbing.

1935
01:21:05,490 --> 01:21:10,490
I can't guarantee it's going to work.
I can't guarantee I'm not going to go 

1936
01:21:10,490 --> 01:21:10,490
over the top.
I can't guarantee.

1937
01:21:10,490 --> 01:21:12,000
I'm not going to say something that 
really was kind of fucked up,

1938
01:21:12,060 --> 01:21:16,380
but I can guarantee the only reason I'm 
talking to you because you fucked up the

1939
01:21:16,381 --> 01:21:17,080
cell phone.
You don't.

1940
01:21:17,090 --> 01:21:22,090
He writes this selfishness that inspired
them to talk is the same selfishness 

1941
01:21:22,470 --> 01:21:24,660
that makes them feel they should be 
vindicated.

1942
01:21:24,661 --> 01:21:29,661
Yes.
And make them feel self righteously 

1943
01:21:29,661 --> 01:21:31,731
angry.
It's almost like once you know somebody 

1944
01:21:31,731 --> 01:21:31,731
selfish Twat,
which they are,

1945
01:21:31,731 --> 01:21:33,060
when they heckle,
you know that going into it,

1946
01:21:33,061 --> 01:21:34,920
they're gonna usually get upset because 
the,

1947
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:37,110
the they,
the selfish people that self centered.

1948
01:21:37,110 --> 01:21:42,110
People like this fucking lady that's 
suing this 11 year old kid for hitting 

1949
01:21:42,110 --> 01:21:45,621
her in the face with a baseball standing
near where the kids are throwing 

1950
01:21:45,621 --> 01:21:49,251
baseballs.
She got hit in the face by a baseball 

1951
01:21:49,251 --> 01:21:49,251
and she's suing this kid for half a 
million dollars.

1952
01:21:49,470 --> 01:21:53,960
What kind of a fucking crazy asshole 
Susan?

1953
01:21:53,980 --> 01:21:56,760
Eleven year old kid for throwing a 
baseball and I'll tell you,

1954
01:21:56,761 --> 01:22:01,761
this is what's also repulsive is that 
happened in Jersey and of course the 

1955
01:22:01,761 --> 01:22:04,430
little league is not supporting them at 
all.

1956
01:22:04,440 --> 01:22:09,440
That it's a matter between the dose cock
suckers fucking walked right away from 

1957
01:22:09,781 --> 01:22:11,820
this guy because they weren't named in 
the litigation.

1958
01:22:11,821 --> 01:22:13,480
So.
So the selfishness is,

1959
01:22:13,490 --> 01:22:18,490
is everywhere.
Everybody is fucking self obsessed and 

1960
01:22:18,490 --> 01:22:18,690
it comes from the people.
That's why people,

1961
01:22:18,691 --> 01:22:23,691
their insurance companies rape us.
That's why they rape us because we're 

1962
01:22:23,691 --> 01:22:26,991
all fucking selfish.
People sue and then the doctors have to 

1963
01:22:26,991 --> 01:22:27,000
pay a higher insurance.

1964
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:28,260
They charge you more.
It's like we.

1965
01:22:28,320 --> 01:22:30,390
But we started fucking each other on the
ground level.

1966
01:22:30,420 --> 01:22:31,620
But there's that thing.
It's like,

1967
01:22:31,621 --> 01:22:36,621
I totally agree with that.
Just way too many people that look at 

1968
01:22:36,621 --> 01:22:40,640
lawsuits as the lottery.
I mean we've all seen videos of people 

1969
01:22:40,640 --> 01:22:43,170
faking falling down when they have those
hidden security cameras and they're like

1970
01:22:43,171 --> 01:22:48,171
slip on purpose.
You see them like look around and fall 

1971
01:22:48,171 --> 01:22:48,840
and then they show them the video and 
they fucking bust them.

1972
01:22:49,080 --> 01:22:54,080
But there are people that really do 
legitimately fucking hurt themselves 

1973
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:54,080
because of someone's negligence.
Absolutely.

1974
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:56,490
If your mom is walking and some asshole,
you know,

1975
01:22:56,510 --> 01:22:59,880
mop the floor and didn't tell anybody 
that it was still wet and didn't put up.

1976
01:22:59,881 --> 01:23:04,881
One of those little things,
so everybody chills out a little danger 

1977
01:23:04,881 --> 01:23:05,950
little thing and you fall and break your
fucking hip.

1978
01:23:06,220 --> 01:23:08,830
You shouldn't be.
You shouldn't have to pay for that.

1979
01:23:09,100 --> 01:23:14,100
Somebody fucked up.
My grandmother got hurt in a bank 

1980
01:23:14,100 --> 01:23:16,081
parking lot like that.
She slipped and she hurt herself and I 

1981
01:23:16,081 --> 01:23:18,511
think she only got a few grand,
like they kind of fucked around the 

1982
01:23:18,511 --> 01:23:18,511
settlement.
She didn't get anything.

1983
01:23:18,511 --> 01:23:18,511
She was older,
hip fucked up.

1984
01:23:18,511 --> 01:23:19,240
I taste.
See both sides of it.

1985
01:23:19,241 --> 01:23:24,241
I definitely see that some people get 
fucked over and buy things that other 

1986
01:23:24,241 --> 01:23:24,241
people were negligent about.
You know,

1987
01:23:24,241 --> 01:23:29,070
that they should have taken 
responsibility to make sure that their 

1988
01:23:29,070 --> 01:23:29,070
customers were safe.
I see that too,

1989
01:23:29,070 --> 01:23:33,900
but they also say that there's a lot of 
people that look at any opportunity to 

1990
01:23:33,900 --> 01:23:34,180
sue someone like it's the lottery.
Legitimate lawsuit.

1991
01:23:34,181 --> 01:23:39,181
I'm not talking about those because 
there are plenty of times where you 

1992
01:23:39,181 --> 01:23:41,041
should be able to see the doctor for 
malpractice sows you up and he leaves 

1993
01:23:41,041 --> 01:23:41,980
something in you that's grounds for a 
lawsuit for sure.

1994
01:23:41,980 --> 01:23:46,420
If he makes it critical error,
should you be able to sue,

1995
01:23:46,580 --> 01:23:51,580
like should a guy be able to sue,
say if you're given a guy a massage and 

1996
01:23:51,580 --> 01:23:52,970
that guy wants you to jerk them off?
No.

1997
01:23:52,990 --> 01:23:57,990
Um,
I think he should actually be able to 

1998
01:23:57,990 --> 01:23:57,990
sue you for not offering to that.
Fuck.

1999
01:23:57,990 --> 01:24:02,101
It makes me.
These guys are selling Travolta for 2 

2000
01:24:02,101 --> 01:24:02,101
million.
Here's what,

2001
01:24:02,101 --> 01:24:04,120
here's what annoys me is that the guy 
said he liked Travolta,

2002
01:24:04,121 --> 01:24:09,121
grabbed for his scrotum,
and then he said like a few minutes 

2003
01:24:09,121 --> 01:24:09,121
later,
trouble.

2004
01:24:09,121 --> 01:24:09,121
Whoa,
Whoa,

2005
01:24:09,121 --> 01:24:10,450
whoa.
A fucking housing later,

2006
01:24:10,750 --> 01:24:12,280
man.
If he said,

2007
01:24:12,870 --> 01:24:17,870
if he said Travolta,
grabbed my scrotum and I drop the oil 

2008
01:24:17,870 --> 01:24:18,040
and fucking ran out the door,
that's the guy.

2009
01:24:18,041 --> 01:24:23,041
That to me is a legitimate beef.
But what happened was he kept you going 

2010
01:24:23,041 --> 01:24:27,021
to tell me as a mature,
you don't read that fucking body 

2011
01:24:27,021 --> 01:24:27,021
language.

2012
01:24:27,021 --> 01:24:27,021
Every time I pushed my ass hole up in 
the air,

2013
01:24:27,160 --> 01:24:29,830
fucking chick massage him.
He knows exactly what I want.

2014
01:24:30,350 --> 01:24:35,350
Every time,
every time she creeps up my thigh and I 

2015
01:24:35,350 --> 01:24:36,930
go,
she knows I'm saying fucking goal for my

2016
01:24:36,940 --> 01:24:38,380
balls.
It's an unwritten.

2017
01:24:38,400 --> 01:24:38,860
It,
it's,

2018
01:24:39,280 --> 01:24:44,280
it's,
you're going into it with plausible 

2019
01:24:44,280 --> 01:24:45,721
deniability from both people,
but the mature and the zoos always 

2020
01:24:45,721 --> 01:24:46,840
knows.
The therapist always knows when you want

2021
01:24:46,841 --> 01:24:48,790
something extra,
they feel it.

2022
01:24:48,940 --> 01:24:53,940
They the fucking body.
So do you think that the majority of 

2023
01:24:54,851 --> 01:24:57,460
guys that he propositions,
do you think,

2024
01:24:57,500 --> 01:24:59,620
what do you think his batting ratio is?
I'm,

2025
01:24:59,621 --> 01:25:01,330
I'm,
I'm going to guess Travolta if I had,

2026
01:25:01,360 --> 01:25:06,360
if any of it's true,
I will speculate that he's probably 

2027
01:25:06,360 --> 01:25:07,030
batting 800 or 7:50.
He's got fucking,

2028
01:25:07,031 --> 01:25:12,031
he probably makes ty cobb but like a 
fucking rank amateur because a guy in 

2029
01:25:12,031 --> 01:25:12,970
that position,
you know,

2030
01:25:13,240 --> 01:25:14,650
first of all he's not used to hearing.

2031
01:25:14,650 --> 01:25:19,650
No.
And he has enough money to just keep 

2032
01:25:19,650 --> 01:25:19,650
throwing money at you.
Sometimes I've,

2033
01:25:19,650 --> 01:25:22,060
I've upped the ante.
I've upped the ante with $150 massage.

2034
01:25:22,061 --> 01:25:23,380
Like come on,
I'll be really generous.

2035
01:25:23,590 --> 01:25:27,070
And then not like email when you got 
them with the other girls do that.

2036
01:25:27,100 --> 01:25:28,240
Gotcha.
Like in my hand,

2037
01:25:28,241 --> 01:25:29,380
I'm like,
fucking got ya.

2038
01:25:29,560 --> 01:25:34,560
I know when they ask a certain question,
I'll let you know that you got them on 

2039
01:25:34,560 --> 01:25:37,630
that question because they wouldn't 
inquire if they weren't interested.

2040
01:25:37,900 --> 01:25:42,900
Like um,
one girl told me she was massaging me 

2041
01:25:42,900 --> 01:25:42,900
and I was like,
you know,

2042
01:25:42,900 --> 01:25:43,300
cause she's like,
girls do this.

2043
01:25:43,301 --> 01:25:43,780
I'm like,
yeah,

2044
01:25:43,781 --> 01:25:45,070
you know,
I'll take good care of them.

2045
01:25:45,071 --> 01:25:45,970
And,
and she's like,

2046
01:25:46,570 --> 01:25:47,500
I would never do that.
She's like,

2047
01:25:47,501 --> 01:25:49,090
well,
how much do you give them real?

2048
01:25:49,510 --> 01:25:51,520
I fucking soul.
Got You.

2049
01:25:51,880 --> 01:25:52,870
I saw,
got you.

2050
01:25:52,871 --> 01:25:54,790
And I did for 300.
She let me jerk off.

2051
01:25:54,791 --> 01:25:56,920
I rubbed her ass on the bed and I jerked
off on the floor.

2052
01:25:56,950 --> 01:25:58,720
So she gets,
she makes deals,

2053
01:25:58,721 --> 01:25:59,860
like,
you can do this,

2054
01:25:59,861 --> 01:26:01,080
but you can't do that.
Yeah.

2055
01:26:01,090 --> 01:26:03,100
And you kind of like,
you have a certain.

2056
01:26:03,110 --> 01:26:04,370
Again,
there's a certain lingo

2057
01:26:04,370 --> 01:26:05,600
you go with,
you don't just go,

2058
01:26:05,601 --> 01:26:10,601
I'll give you this because that makes 
them feel like a prostitute and they're 

2059
01:26:10,601 --> 01:26:13,541
really not prostitutes.
It just girls making a snap judgment 

2060
01:26:13,541 --> 01:26:16,571
that you're okay and fuck it.
I'll play with them and make a little 

2061
01:26:16,571 --> 01:26:16,571
extra.
Right.

2062
01:26:16,571 --> 01:26:16,571
And it's,
in a way,

2063
01:26:16,571 --> 01:26:21,011
it's kind of safe.
Suddenly you're going to do anything 

2064
01:26:21,011 --> 01:26:21,011
crazy or in a massage parlor.
Well,

2065
01:26:21,011 --> 01:26:21,200
Neil,
it's usually my house.

2066
01:26:21,201 --> 01:26:22,960
I rarely bring them to your house.
I'll do.

2067
01:26:23,050 --> 01:26:25,990
I can't pull that off in a fucking spa.
They won't go near your cock and a spa.

2068
01:26:25,991 --> 01:26:27,920
They mummy wrapped.
I hate that.

2069
01:26:28,280 --> 01:26:33,280
Whenever they lift my thigh in the 
therapeutic fashion and wrapped the 

2070
01:26:33,280 --> 01:26:33,280
towel,
I'm like,

2071
01:26:33,280 --> 01:26:36,551
oh,
what if you're having them come to your 

2072
01:26:36,551 --> 01:26:36,551
house and massage you,
man.

2073
01:26:36,551 --> 01:26:38,690
That's how many of those girls are doing
the hand release.

2074
01:26:39,020 --> 01:26:44,020
I'd say I've had maybe a 60 to 70 or 65 
percent of batting average,

2075
01:26:44,930 --> 01:26:47,770
but a lot of them I haven't tried it on 
because I know they want.

2076
01:26:48,050 --> 01:26:53,050
When they walk in the door,
a lot of times you can tell by the 

2077
01:26:53,050 --> 01:26:56,381
attitude the vide,
the body language that they're not 

2078
01:26:56,381 --> 01:26:56,381
gonna.
Do that so easy job for a girl man.

2079
01:26:57,130 --> 01:27:01,250
And do you ever go to that website,
like the yelp page for that,

2080
01:27:01,320 --> 01:27:04,120
a happy endings or something like that?
I never knew it existed.

2081
01:27:04,160 --> 01:27:09,160
There's a page that just breaks down 
every single like massage parlor and 

2082
01:27:09,160 --> 01:27:11,040
girls that are like in papers and stuff.
Every town.

2083
01:27:13,020 --> 01:27:15,320
I think it's happy endings.
It's wonderful.

2084
01:27:15,350 --> 01:27:16,160
No,
I've never done that,

2085
01:27:16,161 --> 01:27:18,200
but I certainly will.
It's pretty legit.

2086
01:27:18,950 --> 01:27:23,950
I think I feel okay.
I feel much different about it knowing 

2087
01:27:23,950 --> 01:27:26,531
that you actually get these girls to go 
to your house because I would assume 

2088
01:27:26,531 --> 01:27:28,880
that most girls when they go to guy's 
houses have to be thinking it was a very

2089
01:27:28,881 --> 01:27:30,860
high possibility.
This guy might whip his dick out.

2090
01:27:31,220 --> 01:27:32,930
Yeah.
That a lot of times they know.

2091
01:27:33,260 --> 01:27:35,720
It depends on how if they go there 
because of a recommendation,

2092
01:27:35,721 --> 01:27:36,890
sometimes I'm like,
well,

2093
01:27:37,070 --> 01:27:42,070
she knows that I go with someone to 
massage me and I never do anything with 

2094
01:27:42,070 --> 01:27:42,070
her,
so she feels comfortable.

2095
01:27:42,070 --> 01:27:46,420
You read the thing going in and that's.
Those therapists don't tell me you 

2096
01:27:46,420 --> 01:27:50,801
didn't know.
Trolls is body language and you could 

2097
01:27:50,801 --> 01:27:50,801
have stopped and walked out whenever you
want it to.

2098
01:27:50,801 --> 01:27:55,030
So while I do believe their account,
I don't believe any of them deserve any 

2099
01:27:55,030 --> 01:27:55,030
money.
I feel bad for Travolta.

2100
01:27:55,030 --> 01:27:56,840
I mean,
it's got to be tortured to be,

2101
01:27:56,841 --> 01:28:00,710
to be that guy and want to do some 
things that you just can't fucking do,

2102
01:28:00,711 --> 01:28:01,700
to want to come out and go,
yeah,

2103
01:28:01,701 --> 01:28:03,780
I did it.
So what that means Sonia,

2104
01:28:03,800 --> 01:28:05,750
for millions of dollars.
Get the fuck out of here.

2105
01:28:05,960 --> 01:28:07,760
Well,
his whole situation is so we're.

2106
01:28:07,770 --> 01:28:10,400
Because look,
if it's all not true,

2107
01:28:10,670 --> 01:28:15,670
then it's like,
what is this some crazy conspiracy 

2108
01:28:15,670 --> 01:28:15,770
against this guy?
Like what's going on is this.

2109
01:28:16,040 --> 01:28:17,300
I mean,
if it's not true,

2110
01:28:17,301 --> 01:28:22,301
it's,
it's terrible and he's being persecuted 

2111
01:28:22,301 --> 01:28:23,870
and if it is true,
so don't fucking massage them.

2112
01:28:23,871 --> 01:28:24,620
You know,
it's up.

2113
01:28:24,621 --> 01:28:29,621
Now the cat's out of the bag.
If John Travolta calls you up and it's 

2114
01:28:29,621 --> 01:28:32,741
2:00
in the afternoon on a Saturday and you 

2115
01:28:32,741 --> 01:28:34,751
got to go to his hotel to massage,
I assume you have to suck his dick or 

2116
01:28:34,751 --> 01:28:35,270
he's going to want to suck yours.
We know,

2117
01:28:35,271 --> 01:28:36,390
okay,
now we know.

2118
01:28:36,590 --> 01:28:41,590
Can we just leave it alone?
Like why do we have to beat it into the 

2119
01:28:41,590 --> 01:28:41,590
ground?
Why does someone have to get sued now?

2120
01:28:41,590 --> 01:28:42,950
You know,
don't go to Johnson.

2121
01:28:42,980 --> 01:28:44,540
Did you know like some guys are saying,
well,

2122
01:28:44,541 --> 01:28:46,550
you already had a reputation.
Well then why the fuck did you go?

2123
01:28:46,600 --> 01:28:49,490
Did you go maybe their job,
maybe the job.

2124
01:28:49,491 --> 01:28:50,360
The boss said,
listen,

2125
01:28:50,590 --> 01:28:51,890
you've got to take this one for the 
team.

2126
01:28:52,070 --> 01:28:53,350
Yeah,
but I think you can tell your boss like,

2127
01:28:53,360 --> 01:28:55,580
look,
he was opening his asshole the last time

2128
01:28:55,581 --> 01:28:57,800
you gotta you gotta set the rules right 
away.

2129
01:28:57,801 --> 01:29:00,530
Mr Travolta.
This is not going to get sexual,

2130
01:29:00,680 --> 01:29:02,010
which to him must be like

2131
01:29:02,010 --> 01:29:07,010
the ultimate turn on to eventually think
of his dick in your mouth after you 

2132
01:29:07,010 --> 01:29:09,360
saying those words and make it even more
exciting.

2133
01:29:09,390 --> 01:29:10,290
Yeah.
Could you start thinking.

2134
01:29:10,291 --> 01:29:15,291
All right,
well the question now is how much is it 

2135
01:29:15,291 --> 01:29:17,121
going to take to fucking break that?
One guy was saying that travolta was 

2136
01:29:17,121 --> 01:29:18,970
opening his asshole massage here.
I guess.

2137
01:29:19,370 --> 01:29:22,560
I guess the guy wasn't taking the hint 
to open his cheeks,

2138
01:29:22,561 --> 01:29:24,330
which has a phone.
My God,

2139
01:29:24,331 --> 01:29:29,331
he opened his cheeks as he asking the 
guy who was he asking him to fuck them 

2140
01:29:29,331 --> 01:29:30,040
or just wanting to say ms dot rub rub 
here.

2141
01:29:30,041 --> 01:29:31,830
Like I guess he was just getting it.
If it's truly,

2142
01:29:31,831 --> 01:29:36,831
there's probably just getting sick and 
tired of fucking not having his body 

2143
01:29:36,831 --> 01:29:36,990
language read the way he wanted.
Cheese.

2144
01:29:37,110 --> 01:29:39,330
An animal animal.
He doesn't give a fuck.

2145
01:29:39,360 --> 01:29:40,710
You're just whipping out his dick.

2146
01:29:40,710 --> 01:29:42,780
Bill Clinton's.
I've pulled that move though.

2147
01:29:42,781 --> 01:29:44,700
So many.
I'm not as aggressive as him,

2148
01:29:44,970 --> 01:29:48,280
but he's trying to convert straight.
Guys get Travolta.

2149
01:29:48,360 --> 01:29:49,060
I guess when you,
again,

2150
01:29:49,080 --> 01:29:51,800
you're on that level,
just getting someone gay to blow you.

2151
01:29:51,801 --> 01:29:53,970
It means nothing and saying,
I want to get a guy with a wife and kids

2152
01:29:53,971 --> 01:29:58,971
to stick this in his mouth.
That would be like you only going after 

2153
01:29:58,971 --> 01:29:59,310
lesbians,
like how rude.

2154
01:29:59,520 --> 01:30:04,520
You know,
you're getting all creepy with lesbians 

2155
01:30:04,520 --> 01:30:04,520
and going after them only.
Why?

2156
01:30:04,520 --> 01:30:05,280
Why are you doing that?
Yeah,

2157
01:30:05,340 --> 01:30:07,350
it's just a power thing and you know,
they don't want it.

2158
01:30:07,550 --> 01:30:08,070
You don't.
They don't,

2159
01:30:08,130 --> 01:30:09,480
they're not interested in what you're 
selling,

2160
01:30:09,750 --> 01:30:11,190
but what he wants is the.
But he again,

2161
01:30:11,191 --> 01:30:14,520
he wants somebody who will do it.
What I want is when I get a massage,

2162
01:30:14,521 --> 01:30:19,521
if somebody jerks me off,
I like it because they have to leave 

2163
01:30:19,521 --> 01:30:19,521
with no complaints.

2164
01:30:19,521 --> 01:30:19,521
We're going to tell you,
just checked me off for money.

2165
01:30:19,620 --> 01:30:20,980
What are you gonna complain about it and
go like,

2166
01:30:20,981 --> 01:30:22,140
Hey Jim,
you weren't nice to me.

2167
01:30:22,230 --> 01:30:25,080
He didn't take me out to eat.
Like you really do.

2168
01:30:25,560 --> 01:30:28,230
You pay for the banality of the 
relationship.

2169
01:30:28,630 --> 01:30:33,630
Like,
like this is our relationship right 

2170
01:30:33,630 --> 01:30:35,601
here.
You can not ask me for anything more if 

2171
01:30:35,601 --> 01:30:35,601
I want to give you more meaning 
emotionally,

2172
01:30:35,601 --> 01:30:36,120
that's great and if you want to receive 
it,

2173
01:30:36,121 --> 01:30:41,121
that's great,
but you can't ask for it and get mad 

2174
01:30:41,121 --> 01:30:41,121
when it's not gathered.
Because the totality of our relationship

2175
01:30:41,121 --> 01:30:43,500
was I handed you money.
So really weird psychology.

2176
01:30:43,590 --> 01:30:48,590
Well it's sort of like when you go to 
his trip club and all of a sudden the 

2177
01:30:48,590 --> 01:30:51,231
girls are coming up to you and talking 
to you and asking you if you'd like a 

2178
01:30:51,231 --> 01:30:51,900
dance,
like giving you attention.

2179
01:30:51,900 --> 01:30:56,900
Like what is this weird world where all 
of a sudden these beautiful girls come 

2180
01:30:56,900 --> 01:30:57,960
towards you.
You know,

2181
01:30:57,961 --> 01:31:01,350
it's a complete reversal of the real 
live scenario.

2182
01:31:01,500 --> 01:31:06,500
That's one of the reasons why it's so 
intoxicating and crazy when it actually 

2183
01:31:06,500 --> 01:31:06,500
happens.
It's like,

2184
01:31:06,500 --> 01:31:07,260
even though you know they're doing it 
for money,

2185
01:31:07,350 --> 01:31:12,350
my,
my goal is to blow load my pants in the 

2186
01:31:12,350 --> 01:31:12,350
Strip club.
I've done that twice.

2187
01:31:12,350 --> 01:31:14,040
I've blown two loads of my pants.
That was my goal or whatever I did.

2188
01:31:14,041 --> 01:31:17,820
They start lap dancing maybe once in 
vegas and once in New Orleans I was able

2189
01:31:17,821 --> 01:31:19,600
to get with Louis,
ramy and Pete Corey Alley.

2190
01:31:19,960 --> 01:31:24,960
They were outside the fucking strip club
and I walked out and I had on sat and 

2191
01:31:24,960 --> 01:31:26,880
boxers and I had a fucking load all over
him and I opened my things and I'm like,

2192
01:31:26,881 --> 01:31:30,600
look how great is this fucking when I.

2193
01:31:30,600 --> 01:31:34,770
When you showed everybody your load me 
smell your load once at the.

2194
01:31:34,850 --> 01:31:36,650
The open.
Anthony did I really?

2195
01:31:36,710 --> 01:31:39,130
You have to load like packed into your 
belly button.

2196
01:31:39,290 --> 01:31:44,290
No.
You gave it to Iraq and Iraq almost 

2197
01:31:44,290 --> 01:31:44,290
threw up.
Do you want me to smile?

2198
01:31:44,290 --> 01:31:45,240
You want to smell like.
All right,

2199
01:31:45,241 --> 01:31:46,450
I'll take a shot.
How was it?

2200
01:31:46,451 --> 01:31:48,060
It wasn't good.
Oh thanks Joe.

2201
01:31:48,090 --> 01:31:51,540
It was rough,
but you guys can't do that kind of stuff

2202
01:31:51,541 --> 01:31:53,250
much anymore it seems like,
right?

2203
01:31:53,280 --> 01:31:55,650
Or Center you guys.
Not really.

2204
01:31:55,710 --> 01:32:00,710
Honestly No.
I mean we were careful about saying 

2205
01:32:00,710 --> 01:32:00,710
things that will get us sued and certain

2206
01:32:00,710 --> 01:32:05,250
extreme language,
but that's a self censorship and 

2207
01:32:05,250 --> 01:32:09,110
anything with like bodily fluids that 
are crazy about because the different 

2208
01:32:09,110 --> 01:32:12,020
with ems article and series of article 
is we are on everywhere in the US and 

2209
01:32:12,020 --> 01:32:16,651
Canada and we don't want to have to deal
with community standards issue because 

2210
01:32:16,651 --> 01:32:17,770
we're in every fucking corner of the 
country country,

2211
01:32:17,771 --> 01:32:22,771
so the Tampa laws could possibly without
a doubt to you and they haven't gotten 

2212
01:32:22,771 --> 01:32:23,570
sued and I don't think they ever will,
but they,

2213
01:32:23,690 --> 01:32:24,520
they'll like,
you never know.

2214
01:32:24,521 --> 01:32:27,250
You never want to give them a reason by 
doing something that's unnecessary.

2215
01:32:27,580 --> 01:32:32,580
So again,
I understand why they self protect 

2216
01:32:32,580 --> 01:32:32,580
because it doesn't cost anything for the
city.

2217
01:32:32,580 --> 01:32:33,610
Of course,
none of them any money.

2218
01:32:33,640 --> 01:32:36,320
Now you're a fairly conservative guy 
will come.

2219
01:32:36,340 --> 01:32:41,020
So I wouldn't say you were very similar 
to me in a lot of ways that people would

2220
01:32:41,021 --> 01:32:44,800
think that you'd be liberal,
but you're more of a pragmatist,

2221
01:32:44,860 --> 01:32:47,560
you're more pragmatic in your approach,
but you,

2222
01:32:47,561 --> 01:32:49,960
you're on like red eye all the time on 
Fox and it was all this.

2223
01:32:50,320 --> 01:32:54,820
What if a guy that gets into the White 
House next,

2224
01:32:54,821 --> 01:32:55,810
if someone,
if it,

2225
01:32:56,080 --> 01:33:01,080
you know,
I don't know what Mitt Romney's ideas 

2226
01:33:01,080 --> 01:33:01,080
are,
but if someone is like really right wing

2227
01:33:01,080 --> 01:33:01,440
and they get.
And what does it meant?

2228
01:33:01,450 --> 01:33:05,110
Romney's ideas about language.
What does his ideas about censorship?

2229
01:33:05,320 --> 01:33:06,910
It's more of a moderate.
I'd be to be honest,

2230
01:33:06,911 --> 01:33:07,740
because he was,
he was evil.

2231
01:33:07,800 --> 01:33:09,820
He was the governor of Massachusetts at 
one point.

2232
01:33:09,880 --> 01:33:12,010
I don't think you can be that 
conservative and run Massachusetts.

2233
01:33:12,190 --> 01:33:15,850
I think he's more moderate than say.
A lot of conservatives would be.

2234
01:33:16,030 --> 01:33:20,530
Well if we say if they got a Republican 
candidate that was a more conservative,

2235
01:33:20,560 --> 01:33:23,530
more radical sort of a right wing top 
type of dude.

2236
01:33:24,130 --> 01:33:29,130
We mean the.
We usually see some lockdowns on the 

2237
01:33:29,130 --> 01:33:32,920
Internet easily could see at least some 
attempts at censorship of online content

2238
01:33:32,980 --> 01:33:37,840
and censorship of satellite radio,
perhaps moving the FCC deciding that the

2239
01:33:37,841 --> 01:33:40,510
government needs to expand its,
you know,

2240
01:33:40,930 --> 01:33:45,930
maybe those make some sort of a 
connection between certain events that 

2241
01:33:45,930 --> 01:33:49,051
have happened and you know,
what maybe we need to tone down our 

2242
01:33:49,051 --> 01:33:50,260
standards and make things a little bit 
nicer and they might go.

2243
01:33:50,260 --> 01:33:52,340
I mean know that satellite radio is 
able.

2244
01:33:52,390 --> 01:33:54,730
Any fucking person could just turn it on
and listen to it.

2245
01:33:55,030 --> 01:34:00,030
That's not outside the realm of 
possibility that they would try to to 

2246
01:34:00,030 --> 01:34:03,570
clamp down and sensor satellite radio.
It just like they have censored 

2247
01:34:03,570 --> 01:34:07,291
broadcast TV.
Well they tried to get their hands on 

2248
01:34:07,291 --> 01:34:07,291
it.
They tried already,

2249
01:34:07,291 --> 01:34:10,291
but because it's a subscription service,
they that because that opens a can of 

2250
01:34:10,291 --> 01:34:13,891
worms where they would have to.
Hbo would then have to allow and then 

2251
01:34:13,891 --> 01:34:14,740
they'd have to.
Because you don't have nothing on cable,

2252
01:34:14,741 --> 01:34:19,741
is regulated by the FCC.
They can't touch it because it's a 

2253
01:34:19,741 --> 01:34:21,901
subscription service.
So I don't know if they'll ever be able 

2254
01:34:21,901 --> 01:34:24,121
to get into that because that's too much
of a of a violation where the public 

2255
01:34:24,121 --> 01:34:25,510
airways,
their argument is the argument.

2256
01:34:25,511 --> 01:34:27,070
But I don't think they have any shot at 
getting.

2257
01:34:27,730 --> 01:34:28,450
Well,
I don't think.

2258
01:34:29,320 --> 01:34:31,450
I don't know.
I don't think they would either,

2259
01:34:31,451 --> 01:34:36,451
but I think they could.
I think it is possible if the right 

2260
01:34:36,451 --> 01:34:36,451
person was an office,
you know,

2261
01:34:36,451 --> 01:34:40,771
so much of this country relies on 
momentum and win with ideas.

2262
01:34:42,190 --> 01:34:43,780
Especially like,
you know,

2263
01:34:44,170 --> 01:34:45,830
people that decide what people 
shouldn't,

2264
01:34:45,880 --> 01:34:50,880
shouldn't be able to say when you know,
when someone says you can't say faggot 

2265
01:34:50,880 --> 01:34:51,220
or someone says you can't say retard or 
someone says.

2266
01:34:51,370 --> 01:34:53,860
And we really go after people that do 
that.

2267
01:34:54,350 --> 01:34:59,350
You start,
you get into a very tricky situation 

2268
01:34:59,350 --> 01:35:01,990
where it's like,
who decides what can and can't be said 

2269
01:35:01,990 --> 01:35:03,770
and that that's a weird thing when 
everybody's pulling back,

2270
01:35:03,800 --> 01:35:08,800
when everybody's holding off and not 
honestly expressing themselves.

2271
01:35:08,871 --> 01:35:13,871
Like you can't just completely eliminate
words and the vocabulary because you've 

2272
01:35:13,871 --> 01:35:14,810
decided that they hurt feelings too 
much.

2273
01:35:15,020 --> 01:35:18,350
Because what about all the fun times you
have called someone a fucking retard,

2274
01:35:18,610 --> 01:35:18,790
the.

2275
01:35:18,910 --> 01:35:22,040
There's some great moments in life where
you say,

2276
01:35:22,160 --> 01:35:27,160
Oh my God,
I'm a fucking retard and your friends 

2277
01:35:27,160 --> 01:35:29,831
are how old and and laugh and you're 
saying you shouldn't be able to do that 

2278
01:35:29,831 --> 01:35:34,001
anymore.
It shouldn't be able to have a positive 

2279
01:35:34,001 --> 01:35:36,071
thing.
It shouldn't be able to be a fun word 

2280
01:35:36,071 --> 01:35:36,200
that you can express either on the radio
or through friends,

2281
01:35:36,260 --> 01:35:41,260
you know.
Really is it only negative and only 

2282
01:35:41,260 --> 01:35:41,260
because of the fact that some people 
negatively react to it.

2283
01:35:41,300 --> 01:35:43,670
Now it has to be eliminated really well.
Again,

2284
01:35:43,671 --> 01:35:46,490
once again,
once the naacp buried the word nigger,

2285
01:35:46,491 --> 01:35:51,491
they had that maybe that they had like a
symbolic funeral and I understood why 

2286
01:35:51,491 --> 01:35:54,581
Michael Richards.
I think what he did was shitty because 

2287
01:35:54,581 --> 01:35:57,341
he was yelling at an angle.
There's a huge difference between that 

2288
01:35:57,341 --> 01:35:57,341
and saying something in the context of a
joke,

2289
01:35:57,341 --> 01:35:59,360
but once that happened,
once one word goes,

2290
01:35:59,420 --> 01:36:04,420
even though that's a reprehensible word 
and it has a horrible history attached 

2291
01:36:04,420 --> 01:36:07,961
to it,
that word has a history attached to it 

2292
01:36:07,961 --> 01:36:07,961
that most words don't.

2293
01:36:07,961 --> 01:36:07,961
So dehumanizing word.
And it was.

2294
01:36:07,961 --> 01:36:10,250
Yeah,
and it was used a lot.

2295
01:36:10,310 --> 01:36:12,530
I mean,
and it was used in a direct,

2296
01:36:12,910 --> 01:36:13,910
uh,
oppression.

2297
01:36:13,940 --> 01:36:16,760
There's a lot of reasons why it's a 
tremendously damaging word,

2298
01:36:17,360 --> 01:36:20,030
but the fact that it was quote unquote 
removed.

2299
01:36:20,180 --> 01:36:22,670
Now everybody justifiably says,
look,

2300
01:36:22,671 --> 01:36:23,330
well,
if I get hurt,

2301
01:36:23,390 --> 01:36:25,730
be retard hurts me.
This hurts me.

2302
01:36:25,731 --> 01:36:27,560
And eventually it's going to go into 
other words.

2303
01:36:27,561 --> 01:36:31,760
So you can't respect any of it.
I self-censor like you do because I make

2304
01:36:31,761 --> 01:36:33,860
decisions on what the reaction is going 
to be.

2305
01:36:33,861 --> 01:36:35,330
Is it going to get me the reaction I 
want?

2306
01:36:35,540 --> 01:36:38,210
But you can't fucking regulated.
You can't regulate lenny.

2307
01:36:38,211 --> 01:36:40,340
Bruce had it right in the fucking 
fifties.

2308
01:36:40,430 --> 01:36:42,890
He's like,
if you just say it over and over again,

2309
01:36:42,891 --> 01:36:44,540
it won't mean anything.
And that weren't hurt.

2310
01:36:44,541 --> 01:36:46,700
Some little kid's feeling right.
You call him a nigger,

2311
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:47,870
won't mean anything.

2312
01:36:47,930 --> 01:36:48,650
Yeah,
he was right.

2313
01:36:48,651 --> 01:36:53,120
But I mean they.
But they ruined them.

2314
01:36:53,121 --> 01:36:58,121
I mean,
he's so sad because you just wanted to 

2315
01:36:58,121 --> 01:37:00,041
do is act for the court just for one of 
them to see that it wasn't obscene and 

2316
01:37:00,041 --> 01:37:00,041
like fucking,
you know,

2317
01:37:00,041 --> 01:37:02,390
it's really a sad fucking terrifying 
store.

2318
01:37:02,590 --> 01:37:03,590
It is.
Heroin,

2319
01:37:03,620 --> 01:37:08,620
all of it together without the heroin 
that still would want to know what I 

2320
01:37:08,620 --> 01:37:09,030
mean.
Fucking ruined his life.

2321
01:37:09,031 --> 01:37:10,190
Of course.
I mean he was the,

2322
01:37:10,191 --> 01:37:15,191
the original groundbreaker,
but it's almost like you have to have a 

2323
01:37:15,191 --> 01:37:15,440
guy who's just completely wild,
like lenny,

2324
01:37:15,450 --> 01:37:17,570
the Kinda guy that would get hooked on 
heroin.

2325
01:37:17,780 --> 01:37:20,510
You'd almost have to have that guy.
It'd be the first guy to really step out

2326
01:37:20,511 --> 01:37:25,511
like that.
But I'm conservative about stuff like 

2327
01:37:25,511 --> 01:37:25,511
that,
like about,

2328
01:37:25,511 --> 01:37:25,511
about terrorism.
I'm conservative about crime,

2329
01:37:25,511 --> 01:37:30,431
certain tax issues,
but I'm very liberal about things like 

2330
01:37:30,431 --> 01:37:31,400
gay marriage,
like the liberals have really lost me on

2331
01:37:31,401 --> 01:37:31,820
language.

2332
01:37:31,830 --> 01:37:34,130
I began to hate liberals because the 
language obsession,

2333
01:37:34,340 --> 01:37:36,630
but the conservatives with their whole 
antigay stance,

2334
01:37:36,650 --> 01:37:40,090
I fucking hate them for like I hate.
Well,

2335
01:37:40,100 --> 01:37:42,920
the conservatives,
the problem on the conservative side too

2336
01:37:42,921 --> 01:37:44,390
is that during the Reagan 
administration,

2337
01:37:44,391 --> 01:37:46,520
it got attached with fundamental 
Christianity.

2338
01:37:46,820 --> 01:37:51,820
That's when,
that's when they really started to go 

2339
01:37:51,820 --> 01:37:51,820
after that,
that vote,

2340
01:37:51,820 --> 01:37:53,780
because it's a strong there they,
they unite,

2341
01:37:53,840 --> 01:37:55,950
you know,
the churches are together and groups are

2342
01:37:55,951 --> 01:37:56,910
together and they,
you know,

2343
01:37:56,911 --> 01:37:58,090
they unite,
unite.

2344
01:37:58,110 --> 01:38:01,800
They'll rally and boycotts certainly 
antichristian things,

2345
01:38:02,020 --> 01:38:03,330
you know,
especially if something is,

2346
01:38:03,331 --> 01:38:08,331
you know,
sacrilegious or whatever they would 

2347
01:38:08,331 --> 01:38:08,331
think it would be.
That would be wrong.

2348
01:38:08,331 --> 01:38:10,140
So they rally and they make a lot of 
fucking noise.

2349
01:38:10,170 --> 01:38:13,350
But to boycotts work though,
like Selma in the sixties.

2350
01:38:13,560 --> 01:38:18,560
But look what happened to Jack Halford.
He was on one of the new shows and he 

2351
01:38:18,560 --> 01:38:18,560
said something about the,
uh,

2352
01:38:18,560 --> 01:38:23,270
the thugs,
he was talking about the Chinese 

2353
01:38:23,270 --> 01:38:23,270
government and he said something kind of
a lot of flack on CNN.

2354
01:38:23,270 --> 01:38:24,840
And there was Chinese people with pro 
agent protesting.

2355
01:38:24,841 --> 01:38:27,630
They were very upset.
She had ended in fucking budge.

2356
01:38:27,810 --> 01:38:30,060
Nothing happened.
How many of these things,

2357
01:38:30,210 --> 01:38:32,970
because there's always a bigger news 
cycle right after it.

2358
01:38:33,560 --> 01:38:34,590
And again,
this is a,

2359
01:38:35,160 --> 01:38:38,340
I don't mean to take away from the 
Virginia Tech massacre,

2360
01:38:38,490 --> 01:38:39,780
but a few weeks after,
I'm Mr.

2361
01:38:39,870 --> 01:38:43,110
two weeks after the Virginia Tech Mass,
a tech massacre happened.

2362
01:38:43,120 --> 01:38:46,260
It takes people's blind off that and 
then nobody's focusing on it.

2363
01:38:46,261 --> 01:38:47,970
The news isn't covering it.
So the boycotts,

2364
01:38:48,180 --> 01:38:53,180
the boycotts are meaningless.
You just gotTa fucking plow through it 

2365
01:38:53,180 --> 01:38:56,810
and ignore it or,
or take it on and pointed out for the 

2366
01:38:56,810 --> 01:38:58,440
phony shit that it is.
And the boycott will probably not work.

2367
01:38:58,620 --> 01:39:00,510
That's what you have to do.
You have to put it out for the phone and

2368
01:39:00,511 --> 01:39:01,320
shit.
There it is.

2369
01:39:01,440 --> 01:39:06,440
You know,
it has to be just come on to stop when 

2370
01:39:06,440 --> 01:39:10,970
the problem is when networks buckle and 
know companies buckle and then they do 

2371
01:39:10,970 --> 01:39:12,120
and they do sure there they're 
terrified.

2372
01:39:12,390 --> 01:39:14,020
They only see the negative.
The island,

2373
01:39:14,030 --> 01:39:15,350
they only see the negative.
They only see.

2374
01:39:15,410 --> 01:39:20,410
They don't see any positive aspect in 
standing your ground on a controversial 

2375
01:39:20,410 --> 01:39:20,410
issue.
That's,

2376
01:39:20,410 --> 01:39:21,000
you know,
I,

2377
01:39:21,001 --> 01:39:26,001
you know,
because there's a bunch of fucking self 

2378
01:39:26,001 --> 01:39:28,200
righteous douche bags out there that'll 
get on twitter or get on facebook and 

2379
01:39:28,200 --> 01:39:31,851
make these big long.
I supported your company and I was 

2380
01:39:31,851 --> 01:39:34,410
always up until you this and just come 
on,

2381
01:39:34,530 --> 01:39:36,500
stop.
Have you gained.

2382
01:39:36,560 --> 01:39:38,760
It seems like he's,
he stands behind most of the time.

2383
01:39:38,761 --> 01:39:43,761
I'm sure this things that bothered Dana,
but he seemed like he kind of stands 

2384
01:39:43,761 --> 01:39:46,191
behind his guys if he,
what he feels is said is reasonable and 

2385
01:39:46,191 --> 01:39:47,270
not like I kind of in the guys like 
doing the trash,

2386
01:39:47,271 --> 01:39:52,271
talking to Dana White.
Like when things have popped up in the 

2387
01:39:52,271 --> 01:39:52,271
publicly,
he seems like,

2388
01:39:52,271 --> 01:39:52,271
you know,
like,

2389
01:39:52,271 --> 01:39:53,250
like you had a thing and you fucking,
you know,

2390
01:39:53,251 --> 01:39:58,251
whatever it he didn't dump you,
which I was happy to see a couple of 

2391
01:39:58,251 --> 01:40:02,040
other things he didn't dump guys for and
I kind of respected the way that company

2392
01:40:02,041 --> 01:40:07,041
handled things on a case by case basis 
and didn't just overreact to every 

2393
01:40:07,041 --> 01:40:07,041
complaint.

2394
01:40:07,041 --> 01:40:07,590
Yeah.
Well you know,

2395
01:40:07,591 --> 01:40:12,591
they're not dumb.
They didn't get to run the UFC by being 

2396
01:40:12,591 --> 01:40:14,100
dumb or being people that conform to 
other people's ideas.

2397
01:40:14,520 --> 01:40:17,610
I mean Dana and Lorenzo and frank,
they're just bad motherfuckers.

2398
01:40:17,640 --> 01:40:19,350
They,
they organized this whole thing.

2399
01:40:19,351 --> 01:40:22,820
The amount of work that guy does is 
mindboggling staggering.

2400
01:40:22,821 --> 01:40:26,580
These constantly flying here and there 
and,

2401
01:40:26,790 --> 01:40:31,790
and Lorenzo to their international 
flights and constantly fucking working 

2402
01:40:31,790 --> 01:40:33,030
on new deals and expanding the,
the,

2403
01:40:33,031 --> 01:40:33,360
uh,
the,

2404
01:40:33,361 --> 01:40:38,361
the UFC all over the world.
And they now they got the ultimate 

2405
01:40:38,361 --> 01:40:38,610
fighter in Brazil.
We just did one.

2406
01:40:38,611 --> 01:40:41,460
There was,
they sought 20 million people.

2407
01:40:41,461 --> 01:40:45,420
Saw it in Brazil.
$20 million people saw it in Brazil.

2408
01:40:45,870 --> 01:40:50,870
Wrap your head around that dude.
You never seen crowds like these 

2409
01:40:50,870 --> 01:40:52,470
Brazilian crowds.
They go fucking crazy.

2410
01:40:52,890 --> 01:40:57,610
They go crazy before the fight even 
started in between fights.

2411
01:40:57,611 --> 01:40:59,530
They were doing the wave and going nuts.

2412
01:40:59,800 --> 01:41:02,050
They fucking loved it.
So,

2413
01:41:02,280 --> 01:41:03,100
you know,
oh,

2414
01:41:03,230 --> 01:41:05,940
I saw all the Brazilian guys one on that
five minute.

2415
01:41:06,010 --> 01:41:11,010
Like who?
Who except for BC over doom and a rich 

2416
01:41:11,010 --> 01:41:13,330
Franklin was thinking of.
Oh yeah,

2417
01:41:13,420 --> 01:41:15,060
a while ago where.
Oh,

2418
01:41:15,150 --> 01:41:17,590
you're taking about joe say Aldo and 
Sharon does.

2419
01:41:17,591 --> 01:41:17,920
Yeah,
no,

2420
01:41:17,921 --> 01:41:20,000
this was this past weekend.
Yeah,

2421
01:41:20,040 --> 01:41:21,250
it was,
it was awesome.

2422
01:41:21,280 --> 01:41:23,050
It was fucking incredible,
incredible fights.

2423
01:41:23,051 --> 01:41:26,050
But what I was saying is like Dana is,
he's not a dumb guy,

2424
01:41:26,110 --> 01:41:27,070
you know,
he's,

2425
01:41:27,130 --> 01:41:31,330
he's way too smart to give into the 
stupid shit that's involved in political

2426
01:41:31,331 --> 01:41:36,331
correctness.
He stands his ground and speaks his 

2427
01:41:36,331 --> 01:41:39,181
opinion about everything.
And so what he wants from the guys in 

2428
01:41:39,181 --> 01:41:44,011
the company is to just represent 
yourself as professionally as possible 

2429
01:41:44,020 --> 01:41:45,040
and you know,
and,

2430
01:41:45,041 --> 01:41:50,041
and try to try to try to promote 
yourself and the guy like Chael Sonnen 

2431
01:41:50,041 --> 01:41:50,041
knows how to do that.

2432
01:41:50,041 --> 01:41:50,920
You don't have to tell him how to do 
that.

2433
01:41:50,921 --> 01:41:54,100
He figures out how to do it.
He knows how to write thing.

2434
01:41:54,101 --> 01:41:59,101
She says hilarious Shit,
stays in character and he backs it up 

2435
01:41:59,101 --> 01:41:59,440
with the fact that it could fight his 
fucking ass off.

2436
01:41:59,460 --> 01:42:00,550
Yeah,
he's a scary guy.

2437
01:42:01,120 --> 01:42:02,890
He's a nightmare.
And he's a smart dude,

2438
01:42:02,891 --> 01:42:04,600
man.
He's a very smart dude.

2439
01:42:05,110 --> 01:42:06,850
Smart Dude that can beat the fuck out of
you.

2440
01:42:06,910 --> 01:42:07,870
What do you think?
Do you,

2441
01:42:07,930 --> 01:42:11,260
were they scared to have him fight in?
Because I wondered like what he was when

2442
01:42:11,261 --> 01:42:13,600
I already filled in Brazil and it's 
fucking scary.

2443
01:42:13,660 --> 01:42:15,840
I was scared because I was going to be 
ringside.

2444
01:42:16,390 --> 01:42:16,930
It's like,
man,

2445
01:42:16,931 --> 01:42:21,931
if he wins this,
see this place could get nasty because 

2446
01:42:21,931 --> 01:42:23,650
he said a lot of nasty shit about Brazil
countries and about Brazilians.

2447
01:42:24,190 --> 01:42:28,510
Brazilian people are extremely proud.
So it's an incredible place.

2448
01:42:28,510 --> 01:42:30,730
It's such a friendly culture.
I mean,

2449
01:42:30,731 --> 01:42:32,710
I know they have crime and they have 
problems,

2450
01:42:32,860 --> 01:42:36,430
but it is like these martial arts 
events,

2451
01:42:36,431 --> 01:42:39,820
the MMA events that we've had,
there are so fucking fun.

2452
01:42:40,090 --> 01:42:43,420
The crowds are so enthusiastic and no 
Douche bags at all.

2453
01:42:43,450 --> 01:42:45,940
Everybody there for a party,
everybody there for a good time.

2454
01:42:46,360 --> 01:42:50,490
They really rude on those American or a 
route on those Brazilian fighter show.

2455
01:42:50,500 --> 01:42:53,230
And when American guy wins,
they get fucking pissed man.

2456
01:42:53,260 --> 01:42:54,310
What do you think's going to happen?
I mean,

2457
01:42:54,311 --> 01:42:55,890
I know it's hard to make a prediction,
but I mean,

2458
01:42:55,891 --> 01:42:57,170
I,
I'm so fucking into.

2459
01:42:57,171 --> 01:42:59,230
I'm going into this fight with Bob Kelly
and we're doing this thing.

2460
01:42:59,231 --> 01:43:00,950
We're just talking to people and uh,
you know,

2461
01:43:00,990 --> 01:43:01,420
for,
for,

2462
01:43:01,450 --> 01:43:03,280
for all and a,
and A.

2463
01:43:03,510 --> 01:43:05,740
I can't believe how fucking site Dan for
this fight.

2464
01:43:05,830 --> 01:43:07,420
I'm so sorry.
Why didn't move favorite,

2465
01:43:07,421 --> 01:43:07,690
by the way?

2466
01:43:07,690 --> 01:43:12,240
Do you know why?
Because Joe say Aldo injured his leg and

2467
01:43:12,260 --> 01:43:15,880
we supposed to defend his title in 
Calgary Against Eric Koch.

2468
01:43:16,440 --> 01:43:20,500
But although had a leg injury,
so they decided to create a,

2469
01:43:20,501 --> 01:43:21,880
um,
interim title.

2470
01:43:22,260 --> 01:43:26,890
So a tenant versus Uriah Faber for the 
interim title and they moved that.

2471
01:43:26,930 --> 01:43:30,160
Um,
and I think that's a fucking spectacular

2472
01:43:30,161 --> 01:43:30,660
fight,
man.

2473
01:43:30,740 --> 01:43:32,560
Hanan Barao was awesome,
man.

2474
01:43:32,890 --> 01:43:35,980
I'm bummed out that we don't get to see 
the Joseph Aldo fight,

2475
01:43:35,981 --> 01:43:37,210
but he's,
uh,

2476
01:43:37,240 --> 01:43:39,070
he'll be back,
but they weren't going to be fighting in

2477
01:43:39,071 --> 01:43:40,480
vegas anyway.
No,

2478
01:43:40,481 --> 01:43:41,440
that was,
um,

2479
01:43:41,740 --> 01:43:43,150
where was that one?
I'm going to be that Calgary.

2480
01:43:43,250 --> 01:43:43,960
Calgary.
Calgary.

2481
01:43:43,961 --> 01:43:44,770
Yeah.
That was Calgary.

2482
01:43:44,771 --> 01:43:46,480
It's hard to keep track of them all.
Sometimes down.

2483
01:43:46,690 --> 01:43:47,560
You're still lucky,
dude.

2484
01:43:47,561 --> 01:43:52,561
It's like you.
If you're one of the few guys who have 

2485
01:43:52,561 --> 01:43:52,561
likened really love what you do too.
I don't like.

2486
01:43:52,561 --> 01:43:52,561
I

2487
01:43:52,561 --> 01:43:52,900
love Lou.
I think louise,

2488
01:43:52,910 --> 01:43:57,910
a genius.
I don't watch the show because I'm 

2489
01:43:57,910 --> 01:43:58,460
afraid I'll be influenced by it.
I'm afraid like other comedians who I,

2490
01:43:58,490 --> 01:44:00,980
who I love,
I'll be influenced by like watching,

2491
01:44:01,220 --> 01:44:03,440
but you're doing something that when 
you're doing the UFC,

2492
01:44:03,441 --> 01:44:04,580
I can't,
I don't,

2493
01:44:04,640 --> 01:44:07,640
I'm not gonna announce UFC so I can just
love what you're doing.

2494
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:09,870
And I told you I think the best 
announcement.

2495
01:44:09,871 --> 01:44:10,460
Sports.
Oh,

2496
01:44:10,490 --> 01:44:11,450
thank you.
Love.

2497
01:44:11,930 --> 01:44:16,930
I love watching those events and 
listening to you do it and it's really 

2498
01:44:16,930 --> 01:44:19,610
nice to enjoy a friend doing something 
because I literally can't do that.

2499
01:44:19,970 --> 01:44:24,970
It's nice to enjoy.
I have friends that are musicians and I 

2500
01:44:24,970 --> 01:44:27,221
really love watching musicians play 
because I have no musical talent,

2501
01:44:27,600 --> 01:44:30,650
no connection to music.
So to me it's just,

2502
01:44:30,651 --> 01:44:33,680
I'm just watching someone play a fucking
guitar brilliantly.

2503
01:44:33,681 --> 01:44:35,870
I just get,
I get a jazz out,

2504
01:44:36,130 --> 01:44:36,770
you know,
it's,

2505
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:39,170
it is a weird thing though that I know 
his hands.

2506
01:44:42,990 --> 01:44:45,140
There's a.
and I don't.

2507
01:44:45,141 --> 01:44:50,141
By the way,
I don't mean that I don't enjoy your 

2508
01:44:50,141 --> 01:44:50,141
comedically.
I know,

2509
01:44:50,141 --> 01:44:50,141
I know exactly what you're saying.
You,

2510
01:44:50,141 --> 01:44:50,141
I,
you know,

2511
01:44:50,141 --> 01:44:54,790
when we watch comedians,
sometimes I try to be a fan of comedy 

2512
01:44:54,790 --> 01:44:58,000
because I really do love it.
So I do watch a lot of Comedians I've 

2513
01:44:58,000 --> 01:44:59,600
watched guys I work with and I don't 
worry about it influenced me too much.

2514
01:44:59,601 --> 01:45:02,330
I think I pretty much had my own idea of
what I do now,

2515
01:45:02,600 --> 01:45:07,600
but I know the feeling that,
I mean we've all been influenced by 

2516
01:45:07,600 --> 01:45:07,730
other comedians and we've all caught 
her.

2517
01:45:07,731 --> 01:45:11,690
So when I was young I caught myself 
doing Richard Jenny wants on stage and I

2518
01:45:11,930 --> 01:45:14,270
really realized I was doing it,
you know,

2519
01:45:14,271 --> 01:45:15,530
it's like,
it sounded like,

2520
01:45:15,531 --> 01:45:16,100
um,
you know,

2521
01:45:16,240 --> 01:45:17,070
I was like,
oh,

2522
01:45:17,310 --> 01:45:19,650
it just sounded so disgusting,
you know?

2523
01:45:20,120 --> 01:45:22,400
So it's,
it's a sort of a natural thing sometimes

2524
01:45:22,401 --> 01:45:26,000
to be influenced by someone that you 
admire or someone who does really well.

2525
01:45:26,060 --> 01:45:31,060
It's like catching yourself in the 
mirror when you're walking to get the 

2526
01:45:31,060 --> 01:45:31,910
comrade.
Just give a glance at yourself as you're

2527
01:45:31,911 --> 01:45:33,620
fucking looking down your leg and you're
like,

2528
01:45:33,621 --> 01:45:35,840
oh wow,
what happened to the load everywhere?

2529
01:45:35,841 --> 01:45:36,800
And you're like,
oh yeah,

2530
01:45:36,810 --> 01:45:38,390
you gotta fucking penguin walk.
You're like,

2531
01:45:38,391 --> 01:45:41,810
how did this fuck fuck is wrong with me?
I bet you that's what it's like.

2532
01:45:41,811 --> 01:45:46,811
If you're washing off a strap on the 
catch yourself in the fucking bathroom 

2533
01:45:47,031 --> 01:45:48,200
mirror.
Yeah,

2534
01:45:48,201 --> 01:45:51,770
and you're not doing a good job and you 
have to go back and clean it more.

2535
01:45:51,810 --> 01:45:56,810
Yeah.
You just keep smelling it when you 

2536
01:45:56,810 --> 01:45:56,810
finish everything to alk to throw it 
back.

2537
01:45:56,810 --> 01:45:57,220
Whoa.
Jesus.

2538
01:45:57,590 --> 01:45:59,420
Yeah.
You can't reuse a strap on it.

2539
01:45:59,421 --> 01:46:01,070
I mean,
it should be something that it's,

2540
01:46:01,150 --> 01:46:02,040
it's,
you know,

2541
01:46:02,180 --> 01:46:07,180
it's so rare that you can spend 30 bucks
and throw in the trash and throw it out 

2542
01:46:07,180 --> 01:46:07,980
real bad.
You know?

2543
01:46:08,090 --> 01:46:10,130
It shouldn't be happening so often that 
you're like,

2544
01:46:10,131 --> 01:46:15,131
well,
I've got to keep a fucking good box of 

2545
01:46:15,131 --> 01:46:15,131
clean ones nearby.
You never want to wear one out.

2546
01:46:15,131 --> 01:46:15,830
Like you never want to go like,
wow,

2547
01:46:15,831 --> 01:46:18,320
this is only.
This has seen better days would I wonder

2548
01:46:18,321 --> 01:46:23,321
what the world record is for straight 
guys that have taken it up the ass with 

2549
01:46:23,321 --> 01:46:23,321
a strap on.
I wonder if there's.

2550
01:46:25,330 --> 01:46:26,910
Who cares about.
No,

2551
01:46:27,240 --> 01:46:29,330
I'd love to know that.
I'll never break it,

2552
01:46:29,331 --> 01:46:30,490
but I'll admire whoever.
Got It.

2553
01:46:31,940 --> 01:46:36,940
Yeah.
There's certain things in the world 

2554
01:46:36,940 --> 01:46:36,940
record where you're like,
Gee,

2555
01:46:36,940 --> 01:46:36,940
I mean,
how badly do you want to be recognized?

2556
01:46:36,940 --> 01:46:37,790
You creep.
Yeah.

2557
01:46:37,950 --> 01:46:42,950
Grand.
Grow your fingernails 15 feet long and 

2558
01:46:42,950 --> 01:46:42,950
kill the nerves in your arm.
You know,

2559
01:46:42,950 --> 01:46:42,950
they,
they,

2560
01:46:42,950 --> 01:46:43,760
those guys grow their fingers.
They have,

2561
01:46:43,930 --> 01:46:47,330
they suffer permanent nerve damage.
They just look like they're hand smell.

2562
01:46:47,360 --> 01:46:48,170
Oh yeah,
like they don't.

2563
01:46:48,171 --> 01:46:50,250
You ever smelled like under a nail.
It's not good.

2564
01:46:50,290 --> 01:46:52,200
Well,
those nails are insane.

2565
01:46:52,201 --> 01:46:56,160
Like you're not some kind of crazy 
obsession who's you've ever seen those?

2566
01:46:56,860 --> 01:46:59,910
It's really nutty.
Pull up a picture of the guy who won the

2567
01:46:59,911 --> 01:47:04,911
world's record for the longest nails 
because this guy like literally his arm 

2568
01:47:04,981 --> 01:47:06,900
became useless.
Is He Indian?

2569
01:47:07,050 --> 01:47:09,840
Yes.
I think I've seen him and he just wanted

2570
01:47:09,841 --> 01:47:11,250
to get in that Guinness Book,
man.

2571
01:47:11,520 --> 01:47:16,520
To him,
it was so important that he gave up the 

2572
01:47:16,520 --> 01:47:18,741
use of one of his arms just so he could 
grow the longest nails and they look 

2573
01:47:18,741 --> 01:47:23,110
like a tree.
He looks like he looks at me and 

2574
01:47:23,110 --> 01:47:23,110
asshole.
Oh my God,

2575
01:47:23,110 --> 01:47:24,660
look,
look how nutty that is.

2576
01:47:24,661 --> 01:47:27,630
But he just looks like an Asshole,
but bottled people tell him like,

2577
01:47:27,631 --> 01:47:30,240
you look stupid.
Oh my God.

2578
01:47:30,241 --> 01:47:34,110
Is that her nails?
That's like jazz hands.

2579
01:47:34,140 --> 01:47:36,390
They can't be real.
They're real.

2580
01:47:36,450 --> 01:47:37,560
Yeah.
That's Jasean Wolverine.

2581
01:47:37,590 --> 01:47:38,370
Come on man.
As they say,

2582
01:47:38,371 --> 01:47:39,360
they're real,
of course is.

2583
01:47:39,450 --> 01:47:41,580
Why would a woman,
what does it say?

2584
01:47:41,790 --> 01:47:46,530
World's longest number home.
She's a giant head to her.

2585
01:47:46,531 --> 01:47:49,540
Head off a god that is instills nails 
are insane.

2586
01:47:49,590 --> 01:47:52,260
SRN myfreecams.
Oh my God.

2587
01:47:52,290 --> 01:47:53,940
How does she even wipe her pussy?
Yeah,

2588
01:47:53,941 --> 01:47:54,780
right.
Exactly.

2589
01:47:54,870 --> 01:47:56,460
To backup.
Check that shit out.

2590
01:47:56,461 --> 01:47:58,050
And look at video.
EPA tests on her.

2591
01:47:58,051 --> 01:48:01,140
They're all short right there.
That's why they are so short.

2592
01:48:01,141 --> 01:48:02,220
They're,
oh my God,

2593
01:48:02,221 --> 01:48:06,000
these are wolf clause.
This is so strange.

2594
01:48:08,370 --> 01:48:13,370
Um,
I just kind of a challenge to myself to 

2595
01:48:13,370 --> 01:48:17,291
see how far they would go before they 
started twisting out of shape and I 

2596
01:48:17,291 --> 01:48:21,401
couldn't cut on.
So they just kept growing and growing 

2597
01:48:21,401 --> 01:48:22,490
and I kept setting dates and dates that 
I was gonna do it.

2598
01:48:22,491 --> 01:48:27,491
And then I started getting all of this 
out worldwide notoriety.

2599
01:48:29,030 --> 01:48:34,030
And,
and then it's strange how they be come 

2600
01:48:34,030 --> 01:48:34,030
part of you.

2601
01:48:34,520 --> 01:48:37,520
Exactly what her house looked like,
a writer,

2602
01:48:37,521 --> 01:48:42,521
a in the Midwest,
although her nails go under her forearm 

2603
01:48:42,521 --> 01:48:43,310
while she was writing,

2604
01:48:44,230 --> 01:48:48,640
the door was open and I looked out and I
could see the road going and um,

2605
01:48:50,090 --> 01:48:55,090
I just felt kind of like a section and I
remember nothing after the feeling of 

2606
01:48:57,501 --> 01:49:02,501
being sucked out of the vehicle,
the first thing I spotted was a 

2607
01:49:02,501 --> 01:49:04,430
fingernail and I did.
Oh,

2608
01:49:04,700 --> 01:49:07,340
I kind of started to cry.
There's one of my fingernails.

2609
01:49:08,020 --> 01:49:09,100
Oh,
that's great.

2610
01:49:09,220 --> 01:49:14,220
I couldn't,
I couldn't have had a better ending as 

2611
01:49:14,220 --> 01:49:14,260
far as I'm concerned.
Fucking brokered dumb nails.

2612
01:49:14,350 --> 01:49:16,300
Good ahead.
That is crazy.

2613
01:49:16,301 --> 01:49:19,660
I wonder if her nails were the fault of 
the accident,

2614
01:49:19,661 --> 01:49:21,450
right?
She probably couldn't steer properly.

2615
01:49:21,490 --> 01:49:22,180
Oh yeah.
Right.

2616
01:49:22,210 --> 01:49:27,210
Yeah.
I probably couldn't grip the fucking 

2617
01:49:27,210 --> 01:49:27,210
thing.
Look at this guy here.

2618
01:49:27,210 --> 01:49:27,330
Oh my God.
That's the Indian guy.

2619
01:49:27,430 --> 01:49:29,050
Oh,
look at those things.

2620
01:49:29,850 --> 01:49:30,490
There's.
Oh,

2621
01:49:30,520 --> 01:49:33,470
that's so much.
A woman's Pussy CEO.

2622
01:49:33,910 --> 01:49:38,910
She had the woman's longest nails,
but this motherfucker's got the longest 

2623
01:49:38,910 --> 01:49:40,330
nails in them.
Shits are ridiculous.

2624
01:49:40,360 --> 01:49:42,700
That's,
that's a totally different animal.

2625
01:49:42,701 --> 01:49:47,701
I think that's more needier.
How much did you love to fucking just 

2626
01:49:47,701 --> 01:49:47,701
acts those?
Oh

2627
01:49:48,060 --> 01:49:48,200
No.

2628
01:49:48,960 --> 01:49:53,960
Changed and I became so that pushed me 
to keep my conviction,

2629
01:49:59,940 --> 01:50:00,410
snails,

2630
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:01,900
alien,
nails.

2631
01:50:02,580 --> 01:50:07,580
She went what they taste like.
Oh my God,

2632
01:50:08,741 --> 01:50:10,270
look,
he's got taped together.

2633
01:50:11,300 --> 01:50:16,300
A tape has gotten yellow.
Look how gross that is taped up and 

2634
01:50:17,491 --> 01:50:22,491
it's.
It swings around in a big circle around 

2635
01:50:22,491 --> 01:50:24,781
his thumb.
I would not want to eat at this 

2636
01:50:24,781 --> 01:50:24,781
restaurant now.
Hey Kevin,

2637
01:50:24,781 --> 01:50:27,340
the guy quit.
Fucking arm is worthless.

2638
01:50:27,640 --> 01:50:32,640
Useless.
He gave up use of his left arm just to 

2639
01:50:32,640 --> 01:50:33,530
be a cool guy with the longest nails,
but who I.

2640
01:50:33,780 --> 01:50:38,780
This is white.
That tell them that there's look 

2641
01:50:38,780 --> 01:50:38,780
terrible.
I don't know man.

2642
01:50:38,780 --> 01:50:42,450
In India people are different in 
different parts of the world would have 

2643
01:50:42,450 --> 01:50:42,450
been India.
That's the shit.

2644
01:50:42,450 --> 01:50:45,990
It's probably like a hoarder.
It's probably like a disease and mental 

2645
01:50:45,990 --> 01:50:45,990
disease probably,
right?

2646
01:50:45,990 --> 01:50:46,630
You can have like a sense of 
accomplishment.

2647
01:50:46,631 --> 01:50:51,631
So there's one thing in your life that 
you know is normal or awesome or 

2648
01:50:51,631 --> 01:50:51,631
something thing.

2649
01:50:51,631 --> 01:50:52,420
You're good at cutting your nails.
What a shitty thing.

2650
01:50:52,421 --> 01:50:55,930
It'd be so crazy.
The idea that somehow or another there's

2651
01:50:55,940 --> 01:51:00,940
value,
but it is because people are paying 

2652
01:51:00,940 --> 01:51:00,940
attention to them.
Yeah,

2653
01:51:00,940 --> 01:51:01,460
but not good attention.
People pay attention to Sandusky too,

2654
01:51:01,461 --> 01:51:02,380
but nothing like,
you know what I mean?

2655
01:51:02,381 --> 01:51:03,550
Is it's bad reasons.
Yeah.

2656
01:51:03,620 --> 01:51:05,020
But they're not angry at him.
They're like,

2657
01:51:05,021 --> 01:51:06,220
well,
they want to look at it.

2658
01:51:06,430 --> 01:51:08,090
Maybe that's all he needs.
You know?

2659
01:51:08,110 --> 01:51:10,060
He just needs someone to want to stare 
at them.

2660
01:51:10,061 --> 01:51:11,930
And just a reaction.
I mean,

2661
01:51:12,220 --> 01:51:13,840
is it even positive?
It's like woo.

2662
01:51:13,841 --> 01:51:15,760
Like people look at it,
they look at it and it's not,

2663
01:51:15,860 --> 01:51:17,830
it's,
it's horrific for sure.

2664
01:51:17,831 --> 01:51:20,110
It's disgusting.
But it's also energetic.

2665
01:51:20,111 --> 01:51:21,520
You're like,
oh whoa.

2666
01:51:21,730 --> 01:51:24,970
To him it might be just that.
Just the fact that everywhere he goes,

2667
01:51:25,750 --> 01:51:28,480
there's no denying that he gets a 
significant reaction,

2668
01:51:28,720 --> 01:51:28,930
you know?

2669
01:51:28,930 --> 01:51:31,230
So that's enough.
So it gives him like important.

2670
01:51:31,231 --> 01:51:36,231
So it gives them something.
You think he's a very uninteresting guy 

2671
01:51:36,231 --> 01:51:36,231
and that's the one time people show 
interest.

2672
01:51:36,231 --> 01:51:37,930
Like every story he Kelsey,
but probably zone out.

2673
01:51:37,931 --> 01:51:39,430
He probably sees their eyes going up in 
the air.

2674
01:51:39,431 --> 01:51:44,431
He's probably a terrible bore it all he 
talks about is fucking stupid nails all 

2675
01:51:44,920 --> 01:51:49,920
day.
Do you think he segues every 

2676
01:51:49,920 --> 01:51:51,601
conversation,
tries to steer it back to his fucking 

2677
01:51:51,601 --> 01:51:51,601
stupid left.
His wife wants to talk about the news.

2678
01:51:51,601 --> 01:51:53,890
That is a guy in Pakistan who thinks he 
can grow longer.

2679
01:51:53,891 --> 01:51:56,050
Nails done me.
Fuck you.

2680
01:51:56,110 --> 01:51:57,850
I say to him,
fuck you.

2681
01:51:58,120 --> 01:52:03,120
I will never quit.
He thinks I would have quit and he just 

2682
01:52:03,120 --> 01:52:06,301
gets mad when he hears about dudes,
try and take his crown one if there's 

2683
01:52:06,301 --> 01:52:09,361
like a,
an online giant nail community where 

2684
01:52:09,361 --> 01:52:09,361
they can like check does.

2685
01:52:09,361 --> 01:52:13,430
There's like fat websites were dudes 
would try to gain weight a purpose and 

2686
01:52:13,430 --> 01:52:16,210
like taught like it was like sort of a 
bear thing and talk about a hot.

2687
01:52:16,211 --> 01:52:21,211
Their guts looked to end a relationship 
that's A.

2688
01:52:22,020 --> 01:52:25,570
Brian hates himself and do a fucking 
sponge shape.

2689
01:52:26,190 --> 01:52:29,780
Like so disgusted with me.
They break up with me.

2690
01:52:31,690 --> 01:52:36,690
I got a lot of weight to lose now guys.
So that's a hilarious joke and should 

2691
01:52:36,690 --> 01:52:36,690
talk about that on stage because it's so
funny.

2692
01:52:36,690 --> 01:52:39,310
And in his truck accident have you 
should do it more often.

2693
01:52:39,640 --> 01:52:41,680
It's really hard to get like a fucking 
pig man.

2694
01:52:42,700 --> 01:52:43,870
Dude.
I hit my body.

2695
01:52:43,960 --> 01:52:46,190
It's just where the speed alone.
I just forget

2696
01:52:46,190 --> 01:52:47,270
to eat and I'm like,
Oh shit,

2697
01:52:47,271 --> 01:52:52,271
I really need to eat because I'm not 
gonna be able to eat for like five 

2698
01:52:52,271 --> 01:52:52,271
hours.
What do I have jack in the box.

2699
01:52:52,271 --> 01:52:52,271
All right.
You know?

2700
01:52:52,271 --> 01:52:57,250
Yeah.
That's one of the reasons I like being 

2701
01:52:57,250 --> 01:52:58,991
home so much.
One of the favorite things is because I 

2702
01:52:58,991 --> 01:53:01,571
can actually eat real food and control 
what I eat and actually go to the 

2703
01:53:01,571 --> 01:53:02,930
supermarket and having to eat at 
restaurants all the time.

2704
01:53:03,170 --> 01:53:08,170
And plus the temptation.
Like if you're hungry and you're out in 

2705
01:53:08,170 --> 01:53:10,781
the road and you see a Wendy's double 
cheeseburger pretty fucking good right 

2706
01:53:10,781 --> 01:53:11,630
now,
but you work out so much.

2707
01:53:11,690 --> 01:53:14,780
I went out with you wanting to Austin 
and we a fucking pancakes,

2708
01:53:14,781 --> 01:53:17,240
like you had a man's meal.
I'm trying to nibble on salmon,

2709
01:53:17,241 --> 01:53:18,710
like a fucking fruit.
And I'm like,

2710
01:53:18,711 --> 01:53:19,520
you know what?
Because you do.

2711
01:53:19,521 --> 01:53:21,250
How many of you work out for so long?
You can.

2712
01:53:21,300 --> 01:53:23,660
You can get away with that,
you can't let it,

2713
01:53:23,710 --> 01:53:25,580
let it get out of hand.
You know,

2714
01:53:25,610 --> 01:53:30,610
you can only keep eating pancakes and 
shit as long as you're actually eating 

2715
01:53:30,610 --> 01:53:32,480
regular food on the most for the most 
part,

2716
01:53:32,630 --> 01:53:34,340
like healthy food for the most part.

2717
01:53:34,340 --> 01:53:37,460
And then when that pancake comes up you 
deserved that bitch go crazy.

2718
01:53:37,520 --> 01:53:38,660
How often do you give yourself that 
cheat?

2719
01:53:38,661 --> 01:53:40,220
Like that?
Every couple of days.

2720
01:53:40,221 --> 01:53:42,410
Every three or four days.
I try to do it every day,

2721
01:53:42,411 --> 01:53:47,411
but I don't restrict myself.
Like if one day I'm like at the coffee 

2722
01:53:47,411 --> 01:53:47,870
shop and a coconut macaroon looks extra 
delicious.

2723
01:53:48,860 --> 01:53:50,690
Coconut macaroon.
How often you work out?

2724
01:53:50,930 --> 01:53:52,680
Almost every day.
Just the.

2725
01:53:52,700 --> 01:53:57,700
The key is to just keep.
I take at least one or two days off a 

2726
01:53:57,700 --> 01:54:01,271
week depending on the week,
but the key is to keep it mostly 

2727
01:54:01,271 --> 01:54:02,360
positive,
mostly healthy and you know,

2728
01:54:02,361 --> 01:54:06,590
90 percent really good food.
Ninety percent solids on it.

2729
01:54:06,591 --> 01:54:08,450
But if you ever want to get some 
Kentucky Fried Chicken,

2730
01:54:09,030 --> 01:54:10,820
come on man.
I just have some chicken.

2731
01:54:10,850 --> 01:54:14,190
I would love to actually still really 
haven't had KFC in years.

2732
01:54:14,191 --> 01:54:14,900
You know what,
I like it.

2733
01:54:14,930 --> 01:54:19,930
I like KFC cold with hot sauce.
I take that Liu Kotecha Habanero sauce.

2734
01:54:20,241 --> 01:54:21,350
That's the shit.
You can only get it.

2735
01:54:21,351 --> 01:54:24,830
Mexican supermarkets.
I order it online on Amazon.com.

2736
01:54:25,220 --> 01:54:26,690
[inaudible] DOT com.
Oh Dude.

2737
01:54:26,691 --> 01:54:30,170
And you pour some of that hot sauce and 
then dip the chicken in there until your

2738
01:54:30,171 --> 01:54:32,360
fucking mouth wants to it.
Like that.

2739
01:54:33,450 --> 01:54:38,450
I have to pee.
I have to piss desperately covered in 

2740
01:54:38,450 --> 01:54:38,450
Piss.
Fuck.

2741
01:54:38,450 --> 01:54:38,450
Yeah.
But I don't,

2742
01:54:38,450 --> 01:54:39,210
I try not to,
um,

2743
01:54:39,380 --> 01:54:44,380
to eat too much of that shit.
But when I want to eat something that's 

2744
01:54:44,380 --> 01:54:44,450
Shitty,
I fucking eat it.

2745
01:54:44,520 --> 01:54:49,520
Yeah.
It's fun actually eat with you because 

2746
01:54:49,520 --> 01:54:49,520
we order so much and it's kind of 
getting.

2747
01:54:49,520 --> 01:54:49,820
It's kind of like,
hey,

2748
01:54:49,821 --> 01:54:52,370
let's get to see that half the menu all 
at once.

2749
01:54:52,371 --> 01:54:57,371
Kind of like a,
you're an employee and it's your first 

2750
01:54:57,371 --> 01:54:57,371
day of training and they usually cook 
one of everything.

2751
01:54:57,371 --> 01:54:58,420
You kind of do that in some ways and 
you'll,

2752
01:54:58,421 --> 01:54:59,180
you'll have like,
oh,

2753
01:54:59,181 --> 01:55:02,090
I have just a little piece of this 
that's only after like to show

2754
01:55:02,730 --> 01:55:05,470
if we do like to show somewhere and then
become a glutton.

2755
01:55:05,620 --> 01:55:09,430
I've never seen anyone though my whole 
life eat like you till I met you.

2756
01:55:09,490 --> 01:55:13,480
Like I've never heard of ordering more 
than one appetizer that was new to me.

2757
01:55:14,080 --> 01:55:19,080
There was also,
there are so many things that when I 

2758
01:55:19,080 --> 01:55:19,080
first got to meet you that,
that was so shocking to me.

2759
01:55:19,080 --> 01:55:20,440
Now I find myself doing them all the 
time,

2760
01:55:20,441 --> 01:55:24,850
like talking about masturbating.
I never would talk about my masturbation

2761
01:55:25,220 --> 01:55:27,220
out the public to anybody,
you know.

2762
01:55:27,250 --> 01:55:29,520
And now I talk about all the time.
You're like,

2763
01:55:29,530 --> 01:55:32,320
broke that wall or whatever.
What was down before.

2764
01:55:32,321 --> 01:55:37,321
You've done a lot to me and I think 
you're very influential with a lot of 

2765
01:55:37,321 --> 01:55:39,620
people that listen to this podcast and 
friends and masturbating and talk to you

2766
01:55:39,630 --> 01:55:41,700
about it.
They're all debating talking about it.

2767
01:55:41,701 --> 01:55:41,860
And

2768
01:55:42,200 --> 01:55:42,930
well,
you know,

2769
01:55:43,020 --> 01:55:44,680
I think we all influenced each other.
You know,

2770
01:55:44,700 --> 01:55:45,570
I think,
uh,

2771
01:55:45,900 --> 01:55:49,830
there's a positive things that we can 
learn from all that from everybody,

2772
01:55:50,520 --> 01:55:52,740
but uh,
you know,

2773
01:55:52,830 --> 01:55:54,400
shouldn't be worried about talking about
masturbating.

2774
01:55:54,870 --> 01:55:55,890
Yeah,
that was weird.

2775
01:55:56,730 --> 01:55:57,990
It's all weird.
It's all weird.

2776
01:55:58,020 --> 01:55:59,520
This one of the things I love about 
Norton,

2777
01:55:59,730 --> 01:56:01,470
he doesn't give a fuck.
I'll talk about anything.

2778
01:56:01,530 --> 01:56:03,840
He's just so crazy.
Sometimes shocks me,

2779
01:56:04,080 --> 01:56:09,080
you know,
I hear him talk about things like his 

2780
01:56:09,080 --> 01:56:09,080
girlfriend [inaudible] and with a strap.
Ah,

2781
01:56:09,080 --> 01:56:10,890
I want to protect them.
Like don't say it anymore.

2782
01:56:10,950 --> 01:56:12,210
Stop.
Stop.

2783
01:56:12,211 --> 01:56:14,760
Now this is too crazy.
The urine step.

2784
01:56:15,510 --> 01:56:16,800
He's awesome.
You know,

2785
01:56:16,801 --> 01:56:17,340
this,
uh,

2786
01:56:17,970 --> 01:56:22,970
when you know,
the other thing that happened to you as 

2787
01:56:22,970 --> 01:56:22,970
you got into the world of the standup 
comedian,

2788
01:56:23,100 --> 01:56:28,100
you went from the world of the computer 
salesman or a regular person to the 

2789
01:56:28,100 --> 01:56:29,940
world of the standup comedian,
which is in the world,

2790
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:35,000
I think becoming a stripper in the world
of becoming a part of a weird community 

2791
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:35,460
of,
uh,

2792
01:56:35,461 --> 01:56:37,000
of miscreants,
you know,

2793
01:56:37,010 --> 01:56:39,360
and have a of artistic types and you 
know,

2794
01:56:39,361 --> 01:56:39,760
and,
and,

2795
01:56:39,770 --> 01:56:40,620
and creative types.

2796
01:56:40,620 --> 01:56:42,450
And then a lot of fucking weird people.
Man.

2797
01:56:42,810 --> 01:56:44,970
You know,
so it's like your whole reality changes,

2798
01:56:44,971 --> 01:56:48,340
so that's why like the other day when 
you were in that club and uh,

2799
01:56:48,570 --> 01:56:53,570
jokes and people in the audience were 
like freaking out and pat in their head 

2800
01:56:53,570 --> 01:56:54,390
with Napkins,
you got to realize they're not.

2801
01:56:54,480 --> 01:56:57,220
If they're not around fun people,
right.

2802
01:56:57,360 --> 01:56:59,070
They're not,
they don't get that opportunity.

2803
01:56:59,071 --> 01:56:59,610
I mean,
one of the,

2804
01:56:59,760 --> 01:57:04,760
I think Jimmy,
I bet you agree that one of the best 

2805
01:57:04,760 --> 01:57:07,701
things about being a comic is that 
you're friends with comics get to hang 

2806
01:57:07,701 --> 01:57:07,701
out with comics.
Like,

2807
01:57:07,701 --> 01:57:09,330
like a guy like Colin or like,
like,

2808
01:57:09,360 --> 01:57:10,560
you know,
jody is like,

2809
01:57:11,240 --> 01:57:13,530
you get to hang out with Brian Kaplan,
you know,

2810
01:57:13,531 --> 01:57:18,531
you get to hang out with people who were
fucking really entertaining and fun to 

2811
01:57:18,531 --> 01:57:18,531
be around all the time.
You know,

2812
01:57:18,531 --> 01:57:19,720
it's,
it's a really weird thing with comics.

2813
01:57:19,720 --> 01:57:21,040
Like I,
I do think my friends,

2814
01:57:21,041 --> 01:57:26,041
I'm friends with the funniest people in 
the country and I was on a plane going 

2815
01:57:26,041 --> 01:57:29,130
back to New York and Seth Meyer was on 
the plane and I didn't know.

2816
01:57:29,131 --> 01:57:30,990
I didn't know if it 100 percent him.
I've never met him,

2817
01:57:31,020 --> 01:57:36,020
but I knew it was really weird cool 
feeling to know that at the end of the 

2818
01:57:36,020 --> 01:57:38,160
flight to I think he's great and I 
wanted to tell them that and I knew that

2819
01:57:38,161 --> 01:57:43,161
I could as a comic and I knew that he,
he might not know a lot of what I've 

2820
01:57:43,161 --> 01:57:46,731
done,
but I knew he would recognize my face 

2821
01:57:46,731 --> 01:57:46,731
and I would be able to talk to them.
For them it was really weird,

2822
01:57:46,731 --> 01:57:48,720
like that's what it feels like to be an 
accurate and see another actor.

2823
01:57:48,920 --> 01:57:53,920
Like I'm psyched whenever I fucking see 
a comic I like and I know I can just go 

2824
01:57:53,920 --> 01:57:55,140
up and say hello to them and even if 
they don't know who I am,

2825
01:57:55,380 --> 01:57:57,900
if I say I'm a comic,
like Joan rivers when I met,

2826
01:57:57,901 --> 01:58:00,450
didn't know who I was,
but when she found out I was a comic,

2827
01:58:00,451 --> 01:58:03,240
she had her road manager fucking passed 
me a newspaper.

2828
01:58:03,240 --> 01:58:03,720
She like,
yeah.

2829
01:58:03,721 --> 01:58:08,721
She said,
you look like you need something to 

2830
01:58:08,721 --> 01:58:08,721
read.
I was on the plate and doing nothing.

2831
01:58:08,721 --> 01:58:08,721
So I was like,
it was just a nice bond to have.

2832
01:58:08,721 --> 01:58:09,540
Yeah.
And I love,

2833
01:58:09,570 --> 01:58:11,730
love being in front of the comedian.
Yeah,

2834
01:58:11,731 --> 01:58:16,731
it's a.
especially because I think both you and 

2835
01:58:16,731 --> 01:58:16,731
I,
you know,

2836
01:58:16,731 --> 01:58:20,091
when we started out,
we would look at professional comedians 

2837
01:58:20,091 --> 01:58:20,250
with such all in reverence,
you know,

2838
01:58:20,251 --> 01:58:23,220
the idea that one day you were going to 
actually be a professional,

2839
01:58:23,520 --> 01:58:24,060
you know,
you,

2840
01:58:24,070 --> 01:58:29,070
you're a real comic and then now you get
to hang out with real comics and you're 

2841
01:58:29,070 --> 01:58:30,810
actually like working with these people 
and you know,

2842
01:58:30,811 --> 01:58:35,811
and they're like the people that you 
admire when you were at or the idea of 

2843
01:58:35,811 --> 01:58:36,810
the people that you admired when you 
were a kid,

2844
01:58:36,811 --> 01:58:41,811
you know,
and to know that they respect you and 

2845
01:58:41,811 --> 01:58:41,811
that you're,
that you're welcome in the group.

2846
01:58:41,811 --> 01:58:41,811
It sounds

2847
01:58:42,050 --> 01:58:47,050
like as we always want to be accepted 
and to know that you're not an outcast 

2848
01:58:47,050 --> 01:58:50,341
comic,
but his comments that some guys look at 

2849
01:58:50,341 --> 01:58:50,560
it and you never want to be that guy 
because that's got to be awful.

2850
01:58:50,680 --> 01:58:53,520
But to know that other comics like me,
you know,

2851
01:58:53,570 --> 01:58:55,570
either they don't enjoy my act,
they liked me personally.

2852
01:58:55,571 --> 01:59:00,571
It's fun.
It's a nice feeling and it's a feeling 

2853
01:59:00,571 --> 01:59:00,571
of belonging,
which is very important.

2854
01:59:00,571 --> 01:59:04,681
Absolutely.
Humans like to be accepted when every 

2855
01:59:04,681 --> 01:59:07,831
human wants to be accepted,
and the crazy thing about comedy is you 

2856
01:59:07,831 --> 01:59:10,360
asking for acceptance for you going out 
on crazy limbs.

2857
01:59:10,570 --> 01:59:15,570
I mean you're going out on a limb where 
you're standing on stage demanding 

2858
01:59:15,570 --> 01:59:16,690
people's attention and trying to make 
them react a certain way and laugh,

2859
01:59:17,020 --> 01:59:20,560
which is incredibly difficult.
You could never get a computer to figure

2860
01:59:20,561 --> 01:59:21,130
out how to do it.

2861
01:59:21,490 --> 01:59:22,390
There's,
there's A.

2862
01:59:22,390 --> 01:59:26,440
There's nuances and subtleties to it 
that really only exists organically.

2863
01:59:26,560 --> 01:59:27,610
I don't know.
I think they will.

2864
01:59:27,611 --> 01:59:29,320
They they with chess,
it was the same thing.

2865
01:59:29,321 --> 01:59:32,200
They got Kasparov and those are moves,
those moves,

2866
01:59:32,201 --> 01:59:33,910
those are numbers.
So that's a little to the left,

2867
01:59:33,911 --> 01:59:34,740
one of the right.
You know,

2868
01:59:34,980 --> 01:59:39,980
it's,
it's a big difference between that and 

2869
01:59:39,980 --> 01:59:39,980
the idea of humor.
You might be able to get some humor.

2870
01:59:39,980 --> 01:59:41,830
You're never going to figure out Joey 
Diaz on a computer.

2871
01:59:42,550 --> 01:59:44,800
What's funny is that he's really Joey 
Diaz,

2872
01:59:44,820 --> 01:59:46,720
right?
You know what's funny is that's the real

2873
01:59:46,721 --> 01:59:48,370
dude.
He really doesn't give a fuck.

2874
01:59:48,371 --> 01:59:53,371
You can suck his dick.
He gets up at eight in the morning and 

2875
01:59:53,371 --> 01:59:53,371
goes right to the puck and pot 
dispensary.

2876
01:59:53,371 --> 01:59:54,670
Like a doctor.
Like that's.

2877
01:59:54,690 --> 01:59:55,000
Yeah,
that's.

2878
01:59:55,060 --> 01:59:56,660
But you know what I'm saying?
Like he's a,

2879
01:59:56,680 --> 01:59:58,390
he's a real human,
you know,

2880
01:59:58,391 --> 01:59:59,140
like you can't event,
uh,

2881
01:59:59,141 --> 02:00:00,190
Patrice on a computer.

2882
02:00:00,190 --> 02:00:01,990
You're not going to do it.
You're not going to figure it out.

2883
02:00:02,380 --> 02:00:02,880
Yeah.
It was a,

2884
02:00:03,070 --> 02:00:08,070
I don't know.
Have you tried alienware tried to 

2885
02:00:08,070 --> 02:00:08,980
portray is funny.
Fuck man.

2886
02:00:09,010 --> 02:00:10,700
Oh,
he was awesome man at any guys.

2887
02:00:11,430 --> 02:00:13,250
I don't give a fuck guys.
He and,

2888
02:00:13,320 --> 02:00:15,310
and he really again,
another guy who just didn't.

2889
02:00:15,380 --> 02:00:20,380
I think at times he,
he probably should have like when you 

2890
02:00:20,380 --> 02:00:20,380
look back over history,
like yeah,

2891
02:00:20,380 --> 02:00:21,730
he probably would've been farther along 
if he had cared earlier on,

2892
02:00:21,910 --> 02:00:23,950
but the business finally couldn't ignore
them at the end.

2893
02:00:23,951 --> 02:00:25,330
Like after the shooting Roche,
like Oh,

2894
02:00:25,331 --> 02:00:28,210
that's what this guy does and they 
couldn't ignore it anymore.

2895
02:00:28,211 --> 02:00:31,000
And of course that's going to die.
Well,

2896
02:00:31,001 --> 02:00:34,960
you know what I mean?
He's real hard for a lot of great comics

2897
02:00:34,961 --> 02:00:36,830
to figure out how to market themselves,
you know,

2898
02:00:36,870 --> 02:00:41,870
we all know guys like Nick Depaulo,
who's one of the fucking funniest guys 

2899
02:00:41,870 --> 02:00:41,870
ever.

2900
02:00:41,870 --> 02:00:43,390
Unbelievable.
Depaul's a great standup comedian.

2901
02:00:43,600 --> 02:00:46,450
I saw him again the last time I was in 
New York.

2902
02:00:47,080 --> 02:00:52,080
I went by Caroline's just on a like a 
random night and for whatever reason it 

2903
02:00:52,080 --> 02:00:53,190
wasn't working.
Oh,

2904
02:00:53,200 --> 02:00:54,490
it was the night before I was supposed 
to work.

2905
02:00:54,491 --> 02:00:59,491
That's what it was and I didn't know 
that depaul was going to be there and 

2906
02:00:59,491 --> 02:01:01,670
right before he got on stage I arrived.
So I sat in the audience like,

2907
02:01:01,750 --> 02:01:06,750
like an like an audience member.
I just sat and watched the entire set 

2908
02:01:06,750 --> 02:01:08,130
and I was fucking crying,
crying.

2909
02:01:08,140 --> 02:01:10,480
That dude is funny.
He's fucking brilliant.

2910
02:01:10,540 --> 02:01:11,710
He's so.
And he's always writing,

2911
02:01:12,030 --> 02:01:17,030
doing something about the Katrina 
victims not getting rescued because they

2912
02:01:17,111 --> 02:01:20,290
couldn't spell help.
Said Hep,

2913
02:01:20,350 --> 02:01:22,810
you want to have your fucking fingers in
that water.

2914
02:01:27,580 --> 02:01:32,580
You want some happy.
Dip your fingers in the water and it's 

2915
02:01:32,580 --> 02:01:35,671
not just a personalized.
The tagline is fucking is equally 

2916
02:01:35,671 --> 02:01:37,930
brilliant and punchline.
It was just so mean and so,

2917
02:01:38,050 --> 02:01:40,820
so like fucking Boston,
you know,

2918
02:01:40,821 --> 02:01:43,100
there's that certain style of comedy 
that again,

2919
02:01:43,820 --> 02:01:46,910
people would protest for sure.
There's a lot of shit that depaulo would

2920
02:01:46,911 --> 02:01:49,790
say that people would get mad at it,
but it's funny to watch the funny.

2921
02:01:49,850 --> 02:01:52,130
It's funny to watch him at the cellar 
when they get upset because he,

2922
02:01:52,131 --> 02:01:55,880
nick has no fucking fuse.
He immediately gets annoyed at them when

2923
02:01:55,881 --> 02:01:57,650
they grown you.
This is the seller,

2924
02:01:57,710 --> 02:01:59,560
like more sensitive.
Oh,

2925
02:01:59,570 --> 02:01:59,880
well,
you know,

2926
02:02:00,510 --> 02:02:02,480
they don't know who they're walking in 
to see.

2927
02:02:02,660 --> 02:02:06,200
A lot of them are tourists and then 
Nicole go on and sometimes she'll say to

2928
02:02:06,201 --> 02:02:11,201
them as genuinely harsh like that.
I'm in the back on the UHF and like one 

2929
02:02:11,201 --> 02:02:11,201
girl in the frog.

2930
02:02:11,201 --> 02:02:11,770
Oh,
okay.

2931
02:02:11,850 --> 02:02:16,850
Yeah.
Fucking Nyu constantly just blast the 

2932
02:02:16,850 --> 02:02:19,211
entire room.
I just love the fact that he has no 

2933
02:02:19,211 --> 02:02:20,870
patience for the objection.
I've seen Nick Depaulo get mad at people

2934
02:02:20,871 --> 02:02:25,871
from crossing their arms.
Let's fucking guy crossing his arms 

2935
02:02:25,871 --> 02:02:25,871
looking at me here.
Yeah.

2936
02:02:25,871 --> 02:02:27,010
What are your board?
You don't even fuck.

2937
02:02:27,020 --> 02:02:29,480
You don't think that's funny piece of 
shit.

2938
02:02:30,530 --> 02:02:35,530
But a guy like that,
I don't even like to watch because he's 

2939
02:02:35,530 --> 02:02:36,440
such a good comic and he's so funny and 
it's going to be as good as that guy.

2940
02:02:37,160 --> 02:02:39,830
All I do is measure myself.
I tell I'm on the road with,

2941
02:02:40,420 --> 02:02:43,790
I'm doing gigs with rd and nick and tell
we're doing these gigs together,

2942
02:02:43,791 --> 02:02:45,210
the four of us.
And it's like,

2943
02:02:45,270 --> 02:02:48,650
it's uncomfortable to watch a towel.
It's like he's so brilliant.

2944
02:02:48,651 --> 02:02:50,540
And I'm like,
why don't you just enjoy it?

2945
02:02:50,570 --> 02:02:51,590
Can you just enjoy it?

2946
02:02:52,010 --> 02:02:53,570
I probably should.
Yeah,

2947
02:02:53,571 --> 02:02:54,860
you're probably right.
You can do it.

2948
02:02:55,190 --> 02:02:56,240
You know what,
man,

2949
02:02:56,241 --> 02:02:57,530
I,
I used to think the same way.

2950
02:02:57,590 --> 02:02:58,670
I used to think like,
wow,

2951
02:02:58,730 --> 02:03:03,730
I don't want to.
I used to not want to watch somebody 

2952
02:03:03,730 --> 02:03:03,730
because then I would bomb if I went on 
after them because I'd be thinking about

2953
02:03:03,730 --> 02:03:06,410
their assets and judging my own act and 
saying fuck,

2954
02:03:06,411 --> 02:03:11,411
I'm going to say I suck at this guy.
But then somewhere along the line I 

2955
02:03:11,411 --> 02:03:15,311
learned how to just laugh.
I learned how to just watch comedy and 

2956
02:03:15,311 --> 02:03:16,190
just enjoy it and not worry about like 
my own shit.

2957
02:03:16,400 --> 02:03:18,620
And just like,
I have no it work before,

2958
02:03:18,621 --> 02:03:18,980
don't,
you know,

2959
02:03:18,981 --> 02:03:21,290
don't be so attached to it,
but don't,

2960
02:03:21,470 --> 02:03:23,990
don't worry about it.
Just just do the work,

2961
02:03:24,110 --> 02:03:27,350
do the work that it takes to create an 
act that's good enough so you don't have

2962
02:03:27,351 --> 02:03:29,360
to worry about it and then enjoy it.

2963
02:03:29,600 --> 02:03:33,890
So like when I go on the road and I take
it with me or Duncan or Joey Diaz,

2964
02:03:34,100 --> 02:03:39,100
I like watching.
I like standing on the sidelines and 

2965
02:03:39,100 --> 02:03:39,470
watching Joey Diaz.
I like howling with laughter.

2966
02:03:39,620 --> 02:03:42,440
It's fun.
I don't think holy shit,

2967
02:03:42,441 --> 02:03:43,900
he's killing.
I go on right next.

2968
02:03:43,910 --> 02:03:46,460
I never think that.
I think this is awesome.

2969
02:03:46,490 --> 02:03:51,490
This is fun.
Like I want to watch a guy who's 

2970
02:03:51,490 --> 02:03:52,340
hilarious is making me laugh,
you know?

2971
02:03:52,341 --> 02:03:54,980
I think that was just a shift in my 
consciousness.

2972
02:03:54,981 --> 02:03:56,660
I just had to kind of understand things 
better.

2973
02:03:56,661 --> 02:03:58,760
I didn't get get older,
you know?

2974
02:03:59,300 --> 02:04:02,510
And once I figured that out it changed 
the way I looked at comedy.

2975
02:04:02,840 --> 02:04:04,790
It's funny man,
it's so hard to do that.

2976
02:04:04,791 --> 02:04:05,330
I,
you know,

2977
02:04:05,331 --> 02:04:10,331
you get so quick like I used to,
it used to be I had to feel negative 

2978
02:04:10,331 --> 02:04:10,980
before I went on and I had to feel like 
I suck and I'm not going to do.

2979
02:04:11,050 --> 02:04:13,670
I was almost lowering all expectations.
So if I bomb,

2980
02:04:13,671 --> 02:04:15,710
I kind of knew.
Now I don't do that and I kind of assume

2981
02:04:15,711 --> 02:04:16,880
a guy will be good.
You know,

2982
02:04:16,881 --> 02:04:21,881
you've been around long enough.
How bad does it feel when you go 

2983
02:04:21,881 --> 02:04:21,881
onstage?
Cocky,

2984
02:04:21,881 --> 02:04:25,130
and I've done this before and I've seen 
people do it before and you eat it,

2985
02:04:25,700 --> 02:04:26,740
you go onstage,
cocky,

2986
02:04:26,750 --> 02:04:28,400
you don't ingratiate yourself somehow or
another,

2987
02:04:28,401 --> 02:04:31,030
you miss the connection initially with 
the audience and then you're,

2988
02:04:31,031 --> 02:04:33,790
you're already running on borrowed time.
You know what I mean?

2989
02:04:33,820 --> 02:04:38,820
Then you fucking feel like you can't get
any traction and then you're forcing 

2990
02:04:38,820 --> 02:04:38,820
bits and like we were

2991
02:04:38,820 --> 02:04:43,010
talking about earlier,
like over a motion and so gross that 

2992
02:04:43,010 --> 02:04:44,120
when you just,
you didn't approach the,

2993
02:04:44,121 --> 02:04:45,870
the,
the thing with enough fear.

2994
02:04:46,200 --> 02:04:48,210
You didn't approach it with enough 
reverence.

2995
02:04:48,270 --> 02:04:49,410
You know,
you've got cocky,

2996
02:04:49,411 --> 02:04:50,340
you thought you're just going to be able
to.

2997
02:04:50,430 --> 02:04:55,430
I've seen Joey Diaz do that.
I've seen him have bad sets because of 

2998
02:04:55,430 --> 02:04:55,430
that.
It's just,

2999
02:04:55,430 --> 02:04:55,590
it's one of those things,
you know,

3000
02:04:55,830 --> 02:05:00,830
I think we all do.
I mean I think we all go through when 

3001
02:05:00,830 --> 02:05:00,830
you go up and you just like,
I'm in a fucking hammer,

3002
02:05:00,830 --> 02:05:04,611
these people and then you go up and then
once you miss the connection it's 

3003
02:05:04,611 --> 02:05:08,601
usually you can salvage something.
Like I was worried tonight when I went 

3004
02:05:08,601 --> 02:05:10,380
out and I sat on panel because the first
couple of jokes were like,

3005
02:05:10,440 --> 02:05:15,440
Eh,
well you had 14 year old girls in the 

3006
02:05:15,440 --> 02:05:15,440
audience though.
That scared me because I'm like,

3007
02:05:15,440 --> 02:05:16,230
this is a fucking pig show.

3008
02:05:16,230 --> 02:05:21,230
You fuck it.
And then you start all those years of 

3009
02:05:21,230 --> 02:05:21,230
doing gigs.
You start reaching for like,

3010
02:05:21,230 --> 02:05:26,001
you know,
how to manipulate your act and your set 

3011
02:05:26,001 --> 02:05:26,001
and what are you doing to kind of make 
it work?

3012
02:05:26,001 --> 02:05:30,861
And I knew where to go where I could get
a laugh and it was like I did that 

3013
02:05:30,861 --> 02:05:34,850
totally playing to these people in this 
audience and not to the millions of 

3014
02:05:35,310 --> 02:05:38,310
people around the world that we're 
listening to you.

3015
02:05:38,340 --> 02:05:40,080
While I was doing stuff that I wanted to
do anyway,

3016
02:05:40,081 --> 02:05:45,081
but I cut certain things and winter in a
different order because even though I'm 

3017
02:05:45,081 --> 02:05:49,221
talking to the people at home,
you want the people at home to see you 

3018
02:05:49,221 --> 02:05:49,950
doing well because even though they're 
going to laugh with her and laugh at it,

3019
02:05:49,951 --> 02:05:52,250
if they see you,
you don't want to bomb on a shelf.

3020
02:05:52,270 --> 02:05:54,030
That'd be hard,
stank.

3021
02:05:54,330 --> 02:05:59,330
Even if the jokes were good,
the evidence proves that they weren't 

3022
02:05:59,330 --> 02:05:59,330
good right here.
I laughed at home.

3023
02:05:59,330 --> 02:06:04,190
Fuck you.
These people in the audience didn't 

3024
02:06:04,190 --> 02:06:04,190
laugh at all.
Yeah.

3025
02:06:04,190 --> 02:06:04,200
It was uncomfortable.
Like they just going to be uncomfortable

3026
02:06:04,201 --> 02:06:05,700
for you.
It doesn't mean no.

3027
02:06:05,701 --> 02:06:10,701
This is a big shot.
Especially since you have this history 

3028
02:06:10,701 --> 02:06:13,971
of talking about all of your perversions
and then here you are in front of 14 

3029
02:06:13,971 --> 02:06:16,860
year old girls.
Just about anything that's on your mind.

3030
02:06:17,130 --> 02:06:20,910
Whatever bit you were about to do.
I how many you would never have expected

3031
02:06:20,911 --> 02:06:22,590
that would have been your crowd before 
you got there,

3032
02:06:22,591 --> 02:06:23,040
right?
Well,

3033
02:06:23,041 --> 02:06:28,041
I knew it because they told me that I 
was posted to this Friday with a WHO's 

3034
02:06:28,041 --> 02:06:28,920
there,
Andrew Garfield is playing spiderman.

3035
02:06:28,921 --> 02:06:32,200
I was going to be on the couch with him,
which would have been perfectly similar,

3036
02:06:32,230 --> 02:06:33,330
uh,
audience,

3037
02:06:33,331 --> 02:06:35,550
I'm sure that demo and what I'm looking 
for.

3038
02:06:36,090 --> 02:06:36,840
But then they said,
look,

3039
02:06:36,841 --> 02:06:38,350
because of the finals,
everything's good.

3040
02:06:38,351 --> 02:06:43,351
We want to put you on Wednesday,
which is a much bigger shell because 

3041
02:06:43,351 --> 02:06:43,351
it's the middle of the week and you 
know,

3042
02:06:43,351 --> 02:06:44,010
Justin Bieber's on it.
And I'm like,

3043
02:06:44,040 --> 02:06:45,110
ugh.
I'm like,

3044
02:06:45,120 --> 02:06:50,120
I don't know if I,
I almost didn't want to do it because I 

3045
02:06:50,120 --> 02:06:50,120
realized the size of the show is 
different,

3046
02:06:50,120 --> 02:06:51,840
but I'm like,
I don't want to eat my fucking balls and

3047
02:06:52,380 --> 02:06:54,330
you'll be fine and faith in you.
And,

3048
02:06:54,390 --> 02:06:55,260
and,
and again,

3049
02:06:55,261 --> 02:06:56,800
I pulled it out.
But um,

3050
02:06:57,090 --> 02:06:59,370
it could've been a disaster.
It was a disaster waiting to happen.

3051
02:06:59,371 --> 02:07:02,730
That was such a shit audience for your 
sense of humor.

3052
02:07:02,731 --> 02:07:05,090
You have a perverted sense of humor and 
it's all.

3053
02:07:05,100 --> 02:07:06,230
A lot of it is,
you know,

3054
02:07:06,240 --> 02:07:08,370
even the clean stuff is like,
people know,

3055
02:07:08,371 --> 02:07:10,020
like there's always this wink,
wink,

3056
02:07:10,021 --> 02:07:15,021
hint,
hint that you're a perv now under the 

3057
02:07:15,021 --> 02:07:17,331
surface of it all,
they didn't know what the happy ending 

3058
02:07:17,331 --> 02:07:17,331
was.

3059
02:07:17,331 --> 02:07:17,331
Like I said,
it was a happy ending.

3060
02:07:17,331 --> 02:07:17,331
The jokes,
the,

3061
02:07:17,331 --> 02:07:20,370
it was a happy ending in the end that I 
did it and you let destroys in clubs,

3062
02:07:20,371 --> 02:07:21,230
but they were all like,
Huh,

3063
02:07:21,270 --> 02:07:22,350
why would he do what happened?
I'm like,

3064
02:07:22,351 --> 02:07:25,390
Oh fuck.
I almost started tugging my tie.

3065
02:07:25,900 --> 02:07:27,120
No respect.
Oh,

3066
02:07:27,180 --> 02:07:31,980
it was fucking panicking man.
And my heart to think about like playing

3067
02:07:31,981 --> 02:07:36,981
to the people at home that must've been 
able to realize that you were in front 

3068
02:07:36,981 --> 02:07:37,360
of some 14 year old girls,
like especially your fans.

3069
02:07:37,390 --> 02:07:38,560
I did,
but I,

3070
02:07:38,561 --> 02:07:42,250
I again,
I wanted to do decent because again,

3071
02:07:42,251 --> 02:07:47,251
Mila Kunis is on the couch next to me.
It's like I don't want to bomb in front 

3072
02:07:47,251 --> 02:07:47,251
of this fucking left.
She was great by the way.

3073
02:07:47,500 --> 02:07:49,180
He was really fucking cool.
Yeah,

3074
02:07:49,181 --> 02:07:50,570
she was very nice.
And uh,

3075
02:07:50,860 --> 02:07:55,860
it helps when somebody on the couch kind
of with you laugh a little in the 

3076
02:07:55,901 --> 02:07:56,530
background.

3077
02:07:56,590 --> 02:08:01,590
I did panel on time with Bill Maher and 
I was not supposed to do with another 

3078
02:08:01,590 --> 02:08:02,350
comedian,
but the lead guest canceled so they just

3079
02:08:02,351 --> 02:08:06,040
got more last minute that they never put
to stand up on a panel and they told me,

3080
02:08:06,041 --> 02:08:11,041
look,
certain things you are going to talk 

3081
02:08:11,041 --> 02:08:11,041
about,
this is like Darren Mccain,

3082
02:08:11,041 --> 02:08:11,041
Obama running bill's going to talk about
it.

3083
02:08:11,041 --> 02:08:15,720
So I had to switch my set and a.
But bill was surprisingly supportive on 

3084
02:08:15,720 --> 02:08:20,521
panel,
which really fucking helped a lot 

3085
02:08:20,521 --> 02:08:20,521
because that could have been a 
disastrous situation.

3086
02:08:20,521 --> 02:08:22,480
I found out when I was in the store 
trying to buy a t shirt an hour before I

3087
02:08:22,481 --> 02:08:23,650
had to go over to NBC.
Like,

3088
02:08:23,651 --> 02:08:28,651
look,
we've got some new bill Maher is going 

3089
02:08:28,651 --> 02:08:28,651
to be and how you're going to have to 
change what you.

3090
02:08:28,651 --> 02:08:32,580
So wow.
So you were on your way over there and 

3091
02:08:32,580 --> 02:08:32,580
what bits did you have to do that?

3092
02:08:32,580 --> 02:08:33,460
We're with it.
I forget what I was talking about,

3093
02:08:33,461 --> 02:08:38,461
but it was something about Obama and 
Mccain who was in like October or 

3094
02:08:38,461 --> 02:08:42,901
whatever of Oh eight,
which is the last time I've done panels 

3095
02:08:42,901 --> 02:08:45,691
because after that it was the Jay Leno 
show and then all these bits I was 

3096
02:08:45,691 --> 02:08:45,691
doing.
So it will be kind of interesting to see

3097
02:08:45,691 --> 02:08:47,290
your take after his take,
you know.

3098
02:08:47,620 --> 02:08:49,330
I mean as long as you're not doing the 
same jokes,

3099
02:08:49,331 --> 02:08:50,180
what do you.
Why?

3100
02:08:50,181 --> 02:08:51,850
Why,
why aren't you allowed to.

3101
02:08:52,050 --> 02:08:53,260
I mean,
I probably could have,

3102
02:08:53,261 --> 02:08:55,330
I don't remember what their,
I don't think they said Donald,

3103
02:08:55,331 --> 02:08:56,980
but they might've said you might want to
rethink it.

3104
02:08:57,340 --> 02:08:58,060
Okay.
Well,

3105
02:08:58,061 --> 02:09:00,170
you know,
again to them to what is it at the,

3106
02:09:00,540 --> 02:09:01,060
you know,
uh,

3107
02:09:01,080 --> 02:09:03,490
that expect to comics to go up and both 
of them.

3108
02:09:03,491 --> 02:09:06,520
Do you know McCain Obama jokes?
Yeah.

3109
02:09:06,610 --> 02:09:09,790
Know they probably wanted to switch and 
just in tempo or tone,

3110
02:09:10,240 --> 02:09:15,240
two guys up there talking about the 
exact same thing they might've felt it 

3111
02:09:15,240 --> 02:09:15,240
would have been bad for me.

3112
02:09:15,240 --> 02:09:15,790
So what did you switch to this?
I don't remember.

3113
02:09:15,791 --> 02:09:17,990
I never watched a set when I'm feeling 
like I won't watch tonight.

3114
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:23,000
I mean I'll check it on twitter.
Let's hope it's a fucking good one 

3115
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:23,510
because I'll never say it.
Just make sure I do that after fights.

3116
02:09:23,550 --> 02:09:26,320
Sometimes I check to see if anybody says
I suck cocker.

3117
02:09:26,410 --> 02:09:27,500
Who would say that?
Honestly,

3118
02:09:27,501 --> 02:09:32,501
do a bunch of dudes that are haters make
a mistake or miss something in a replay 

3119
02:09:33,371 --> 02:09:34,390
or something like that.
You know?

3120
02:09:34,440 --> 02:09:39,440
You never know.
People find something to be upset about 

3121
02:09:39,440 --> 02:09:39,440
it.
I'm always amazed when you see because I

3122
02:09:39,440 --> 02:09:42,910
watched the UFC the way,
like I love it so much,

3123
02:09:42,911 --> 02:09:44,210
but I'm not.
I can't just.

3124
02:09:44,440 --> 02:09:49,440
I can't see what they're doing,
but when you go into like you better 

3125
02:09:49,440 --> 02:09:49,930
watch that right hand.
I think it was Henderson.

3126
02:09:50,230 --> 02:09:55,230
Bisping was the best example that I ever
saw a when I at my advisor damage to 

3127
02:09:55,491 --> 02:09:56,080
knock it out basically.

3128
02:09:56,080 --> 02:09:57,920
I think you were saying he's going to 
walk right into his right.

3129
02:09:58,720 --> 02:10:02,520
Well it was really a classic mistake 
that you do with a big puncher.

3130
02:10:02,530 --> 02:10:07,530
You move towards his power punch should 
never do that because you kind of 

3131
02:10:07,530 --> 02:10:07,720
accentuate the punch if you're running 
away,

3132
02:10:07,721 --> 02:10:12,721
like especially if you kind of running 
circular most of the time when you're 

3133
02:10:12,721 --> 02:10:12,721
running away,
you're not really running straight back.

3134
02:10:12,721 --> 02:10:17,221
You're running side to side and this 
bank continued to run towards Dan 

3135
02:10:17,221 --> 02:10:19,000
Henderson's right side.
He was running towards his left,

3136
02:10:19,240 --> 02:10:24,240
so in fact he's actually accentuating 
the punch is running into the power of 

3137
02:10:24,240 --> 02:10:26,080
it,
so all Henderson has to do his time,

3138
02:10:26,081 --> 02:10:28,180
his move,
because it keeps going that way.

3139
02:10:28,181 --> 02:10:29,530
It's like he keeps giving it up.
He's not.

3140
02:10:29,790 --> 02:10:34,790
Frankie Edgar will go left and then 
he'll go right now go left like Clay 

3141
02:10:34,790 --> 02:10:34,790
Guido,

3142
02:10:34,790 --> 02:10:39,130
just fog gray maynard.
A lot of people thought that it was a 

3143
02:10:39,130 --> 02:10:39,500
boring fight because you.
It went five rounds and quita had a hard

3144
02:10:39,501 --> 02:10:44,501
time engaging them,
but the bottom line is his movement is 

3145
02:10:44,501 --> 02:10:47,120
what allowed him to stay safe because 
that gray maynard is a fucking murderous

3146
02:10:47,121 --> 02:10:50,420
puncher that punches really hard.
So it he.

3147
02:10:50,540 --> 02:10:55,540
He played a smart footwork strategy.
Whether or not you liked the fight or 

3148
02:10:55,540 --> 02:10:56,030
not,
for his safety,

3149
02:10:56,420 --> 02:10:59,330
his movement was excellent,
but bisping wasn't doing that.

3150
02:10:59,331 --> 02:11:02,450
This bank had made an error and kept 
moving in the same direction.

3151
02:11:02,600 --> 02:11:07,600
And Dan Henderson,
I knew it was going to time that and 

3152
02:11:07,600 --> 02:11:07,600
when it did,
it was like one of the greatest chaos in

3153
02:11:07,600 --> 02:11:12,371
like the history of the sport.
And that was one of the best one punch 

3154
02:11:12,371 --> 02:11:14,660
knockout ever.
And the followup followup was ruthless.

3155
02:11:14,840 --> 02:11:15,610
What do you,
uh,

3156
02:11:15,650 --> 02:11:18,500
what he's going to fight Jon Jones 
September for Henderson is.

3157
02:11:18,530 --> 02:11:19,780
Oh yes.
Oh yeah,

3158
02:11:19,910 --> 02:11:20,840
yes.
There Jones about that.

3159
02:11:20,841 --> 02:11:22,340
We'll interview them and you seem kind 
of a.

3160
02:11:22,550 --> 02:11:23,060
he's like,
look,

3161
02:11:23,061 --> 02:11:25,250
if I can't be the guy in his forties and
a contact sport.

3162
02:11:25,280 --> 02:11:26,990
And that was his take on that.
What he really said.

3163
02:11:27,020 --> 02:11:28,460
Yeah.
He said something about that.

3164
02:11:28,461 --> 02:11:28,980
He said,
come on man.

3165
02:11:29,010 --> 02:11:30,370
He's like,
well,

3166
02:11:30,380 --> 02:11:31,670
he's so confident.
I mean,

3167
02:11:31,940 --> 02:11:34,280
you think about what the guy's done.
Go through Shogun.

3168
02:11:34,281 --> 02:11:36,350
Go.
Let me go through Machida.

3169
02:11:36,380 --> 02:11:39,380
Choke them unconscious and drop it in 
the way he,

3170
02:11:39,381 --> 02:11:40,610
you know,
you beat rampage.

3171
02:11:40,611 --> 02:11:45,611
Went to rampage.
Choked rampage mean that's the rampage 

3172
02:11:45,611 --> 02:11:46,130
is a tough motherfucker,
man.

3173
02:11:46,400 --> 02:11:48,530
John Jones is putting away some tough 
guys.

3174
02:11:48,710 --> 02:11:51,300
Rashad Evans is a bad motherfucker.
Big decisions.

3175
02:11:51,301 --> 02:11:53,470
Rashad,
you know Rashad got a tough game.

3176
02:11:53,690 --> 02:11:58,690
I think a bit of a tougher time though.
I mean they went to or five rounds and 

3177
02:11:58,690 --> 02:11:58,690
he couldn't.

3178
02:11:58,690 --> 02:11:58,750
He couldn't knock him out.
I need A.

3179
02:11:59,330 --> 02:12:01,130
I think he,
I think John's won all five rounds.

3180
02:12:01,160 --> 02:12:05,060
Well you know what,
Jones is bigger guy and Jones definitely

3181
02:12:05,240 --> 02:12:08,900
landed more shots and definitely forced 
his game on Rashad,

3182
02:12:08,901 --> 02:12:10,100
you know,
were shot.

3183
02:12:10,130 --> 02:12:15,130
I think at one point in time when they 
were training together was probably 

3184
02:12:15,130 --> 02:12:19,151
better than Jon Jones.
But when a guy like Jon Jones comes 

3185
02:12:19,151 --> 02:12:19,151
along,
it's like you,

3186
02:12:19,151 --> 02:12:21,290
you miss him for a month and then you 
come back and you see them a month later

3187
02:12:21,291 --> 02:12:22,730
and you won't look.
I'm at the gym.

3188
02:12:22,880 --> 02:12:25,260
You look at him at the gym and he's like
15 percent pet.

3189
02:12:25,550 --> 02:12:28,460
Like this guy got 15 percent better in a
month and I'm not exaggerating.

3190
02:12:28,670 --> 02:12:33,670
There's certain dudes that just have 
like an unbelievable ability to absorb 

3191
02:12:35,030 --> 02:12:39,230
moves and then recreate them in,
in real time situations.

3192
02:12:39,470 --> 02:12:44,470
Like you could teach certain guys 
Jujitsu techniques and then they could 

3193
02:12:44,470 --> 02:12:44,470
just go out and do them and then you can
teach another guy.

3194
02:12:44,470 --> 02:12:45,970
You can teach them the same shit for 100
years,

3195
02:12:45,980 --> 02:12:48,860
will never fucking figure out how to 
pull it off on a live person.

3196
02:12:48,920 --> 02:12:50,160
Do you think that,
uh,

3197
02:12:50,180 --> 02:12:52,830
with,
with Sunnen and Silva it,

3198
02:12:52,870 --> 02:12:57,870
do you think there's a lot of pr?
I mean there's a lot of pressure on 

3199
02:12:57,870 --> 02:12:59,921
syllabus.
Do you think he has an undue amount of 

3200
02:12:59,921 --> 02:12:59,921
pressure on them?
Well,

3201
02:12:59,921 --> 02:13:01,670
like John Jones Silva is a incredible 
special athlete.

3202
02:13:01,910 --> 02:13:02,610
You know,
the,

3203
02:13:02,810 --> 02:13:06,190
what makes John Jones so amazing is that
you look at his,

3204
02:13:06,250 --> 02:13:09,770
his who's who of opponents since he 
started the UFC,

3205
02:13:09,771 --> 02:13:14,300
and then you look back and see the guy's
only been around for four years in mma.

3206
02:13:14,330 --> 02:13:19,330
I mean,
it's really incredible what he's 

3207
02:13:19,330 --> 02:13:19,330
accomplished.
You know,

3208
02:13:19,330 --> 02:13:21,620
Jon Jones is truly the newest next level
of athlete.

3209
02:13:22,010 --> 02:13:23,810
Anderson Silva is a totally different 
story.

3210
02:13:23,930 --> 02:13:28,930
Anderson Silva is a real veteran.
He's a guy who at one point in time 

3211
02:13:28,930 --> 02:13:32,351
didn't have a ground game and he has 
some losses in the past and he's 

3212
02:13:32,351 --> 02:13:32,351
vulnerability.

3213
02:13:32,370 --> 02:13:34,560
He's lost at the highlight on some 
highlight,

3214
02:13:34,561 --> 02:13:39,561
real loose losses like Takahashi mounted
triangle or run Rio tone and hit him 

3215
02:13:40,381 --> 02:13:41,670
with a flying wheel.
Hook,

3216
02:13:41,700 --> 02:13:42,450
eats,
flying,

3217
02:13:42,451 --> 02:13:45,750
scissors,
a sweep them like a fucking movie.

3218
02:13:45,780 --> 02:13:49,560
I mean he dove on his legs like pro 
wrestling was crazy and then caught them

3219
02:13:49,561 --> 02:13:50,850
in a heel hook,
made him tap.

3220
02:13:50,851 --> 02:13:52,290
The whole thing.
Took like three seconds.

3221
02:13:52,291 --> 02:13:53,780
It was incredible.
You know,

3222
02:13:53,790 --> 02:13:57,210
so Anderson has tasted both victory and 
defeat.

3223
02:13:57,540 --> 02:13:59,460
John Jones is a completely different 
thing.

3224
02:13:59,700 --> 02:14:04,700
Jon Jones is a this new level,
this next level shit where he comes up 

3225
02:14:05,521 --> 02:14:08,450
and you take all these veterans of the 
game and he rag dolls,

3226
02:14:08,820 --> 02:14:11,670
ragdoll shogun.
I mean he ragdolled Shogun.

3227
02:14:11,820 --> 02:14:13,980
He jumping fucking kneed him in the 
face.

3228
02:14:13,981 --> 02:14:18,981
The very first technique he throws and 
he connects and then he just beat him 

3229
02:14:18,981 --> 02:14:19,290
from pillar to post.
I mean it was never in trouble,

3230
02:14:19,410 --> 02:14:24,410
didn't see like Mochida hit them really 
hard while like machita a really comes 

3231
02:14:24,410 --> 02:14:24,410
from shots and he was fine.

3232
02:14:24,410 --> 02:14:25,500
Yeah,
I mean Machida is,

3233
02:14:25,600 --> 02:14:29,790
had the best result that anybody's had 
against John in the first round.

3234
02:14:30,030 --> 02:14:33,960
It was probably one of the first rounds 
that John's last in the UFC,

3235
02:14:34,200 --> 02:14:35,370
you know,
machita one,

3236
02:14:35,371 --> 02:14:37,860
that striking exchange.
So then John takes him to the ground and

3237
02:14:37,861 --> 02:14:42,861
smashes them and choke them unconscious.
I mean what he can do to guys when he 

3238
02:14:43,051 --> 02:14:47,370
manhandled stewards is very unusual.
Anderson is a different dude.

3239
02:14:47,371 --> 02:14:52,371
Anderson is not unbelievably physically 
strong with Anderson is like a super 

3240
02:14:52,371 --> 02:14:57,291
technician who's really dedicated to the
game and has developed his game in front

3241
02:14:58,171 --> 02:15:00,540
of our eyes were at one point in time he
didn't have the ground game.

3242
02:15:00,750 --> 02:15:05,750
He was just mostly like a really bad ass
kickboxer that would try to take guys 

3243
02:15:05,750 --> 02:15:09,561
heads down.
But then like a guy like Carlos Newton 

3244
02:15:09,561 --> 02:15:09,561
got them down and mounted them and 
really controlled.

3245
02:15:09,561 --> 02:15:10,440
I'm pretty easy on the ground.

3246
02:15:10,590 --> 02:15:13,650
Takahashi did the same thing in the 
minute and fight.

3247
02:15:13,740 --> 02:15:17,370
I don't remember what they gave him a 
red flag or a yellow yellow card rather,

3248
02:15:17,490 --> 02:15:22,490
or I think they took some money off of 
Newton because they said he was 

3249
02:15:22,490 --> 02:15:22,490
stalling,
so they stood them back up.

3250
02:15:22,490 --> 02:15:23,340
I think that's what happened,
but anyway,

3251
02:15:23,341 --> 02:15:26,370
the results over,
for whatever reason,

3252
02:15:26,371 --> 02:15:31,371
they stood back up.
Anderson Silva flying kneed him in the 

3253
02:15:31,371 --> 02:15:33,321
face and stopped him,
but when he would get stuck on the 

3254
02:15:33,321 --> 02:15:33,321
ground,
sometimes he would get tapped,

3255
02:15:33,321 --> 02:15:38,090
but he changed.
He changed and evolved and became a guy 

3256
02:15:38,090 --> 02:15:38,640
with a full game and then in the jail,
son and fight.

3257
02:15:38,790 --> 02:15:39,480
That was real.
I mean,

3258
02:15:39,550 --> 02:15:41,700
he had already gotten Dan Henderson by 
submission,

3259
02:15:41,900 --> 02:15:46,900
you know,
where he got Dan's back and then choked 

3260
02:15:46,900 --> 02:15:49,061
him out.
I'm a trap tap Travis Luder with a 

3261
02:15:49,061 --> 02:15:52,550
triangle tube,
but it was because he had travis luder 

3262
02:15:52,550 --> 02:15:52,550
stuck in between his legs and he was 
smashing it with elbows,

3263
02:15:52,550 --> 02:15:53,880
ruthless,
ruthless elbows,

3264
02:15:54,210 --> 02:15:57,730
but he developed a real ground game,
like a real Brazilian Jujitsu.

3265
02:15:57,780 --> 02:15:59,760
Black belt level ground is a black belt.
Oh,

3266
02:15:59,761 --> 02:16:00,300
yeah,
yeah,

3267
02:16:00,301 --> 02:16:00,850
yeah.
He's a real.

3268
02:16:00,900 --> 02:16:01,370
I mean,
not,

3269
02:16:01,530 --> 02:16:04,470
not just a black belt like he's.
He's very high level,

3270
02:16:04,471 --> 02:16:09,471
he's a really good.
When he caught Chael Sonnen with a 

3271
02:16:09,471 --> 02:16:11,751
triangle that was some smooth technique 
and it was the fifth round of a fight 

3272
02:16:11,751 --> 02:16:13,510
where he was getting.
But he had lost every round I think did.

3273
02:16:14,010 --> 02:16:15,480
He did.
There's no question about it.

3274
02:16:15,680 --> 02:16:18,750
It would be a crime to state that he 
didn't lose those rounds.

3275
02:16:18,751 --> 02:16:21,420
If anybody gave those rounds to Anderson
there should be arrested.

3276
02:16:21,540 --> 02:16:23,790
And do you think that jail,
I mean it shows you something.

3277
02:16:23,791 --> 02:16:28,791
It's obviously a heartbreaking loss,
but the fact that he kept going after 

3278
02:16:28,791 --> 02:16:29,950
them instead of just dancing and staying
away for last couple of minutes,

3279
02:16:29,951 --> 02:16:31,900
which he could have done in easily won 
the fight,

3280
02:16:32,140 --> 02:16:33,340
but channels an animal.
Well,

3281
02:16:33,341 --> 02:16:33,960
it's also there.

3282
02:16:33,970 --> 02:16:36,640
He was exhausted.
I mean you've got to realize he's fought

3283
02:16:36,641 --> 02:16:41,290
for and a half rounds going 150 miles an
hour taking the guy down,

3284
02:16:41,470 --> 02:16:43,450
lifting up,
near slamming them down,

3285
02:16:43,630 --> 02:16:48,630
you know,
in chill was on the podcast and he was 

3286
02:16:48,630 --> 02:16:49,380
talking about how tiring it is and he 
was,

3287
02:16:49,390 --> 02:16:52,570
he's really honest about shit like this.
One of the things I love about that guy,

3288
02:16:52,810 --> 02:16:54,940
he said that just you're not supposed 
to,

3289
02:16:55,120 --> 02:16:57,710
a human body is not supposed to fight 
five,

3290
02:16:58,080 --> 02:17:00,400
five,
five minute rounds going full clip.

3291
02:17:00,460 --> 02:17:05,460
You just simply can't do it,
so you have to figure out how much 

3292
02:17:05,460 --> 02:17:06,370
energy you're going to exert,
how you know you're going to try to pace

3293
02:17:06,371 --> 02:17:11,371
yourself.
You're going to try to slowly dragged 

3294
02:17:11,371 --> 02:17:14,221
this fight out,
but you know if you completely go for 

3295
02:17:14,221 --> 02:17:14,221
it,
like in the vandelay rich Franklin fight

3296
02:17:14,221 --> 02:17:15,790
that you see that design was great 
fight.

3297
02:17:16,120 --> 02:17:19,990
Vandelay caught rich Franklin the second
round and almost put them away.

3298
02:17:20,020 --> 02:17:22,270
Had them really hurt,
jumped all over him,

3299
02:17:22,271 --> 02:17:27,271
swarmed on him,
but burned himself out because Franklin 

3300
02:17:27,271 --> 02:17:28,540
survived and then in the third round 
vandelay was done.

3301
02:17:28,541 --> 02:17:30,660
He was just exhausted and then Franklin 
took them down,

3302
02:17:30,670 --> 02:17:32,160
beat him up,
and then the enemy,

3303
02:17:32,220 --> 02:17:36,490
it probably cost vandelay the fight 
because he went for the knockout.

3304
02:17:36,520 --> 02:17:41,520
It's like a perfect example.
It's like you really can't go full clip 

3305
02:17:41,520 --> 02:17:43,750
for five rounds.
Their body just doesn't work that way.

3306
02:17:43,990 --> 02:17:47,140
So you think like a sprint.
You can't sprint for 25 minutes,

3307
02:17:47,170 --> 02:17:48,940
you know what I mean?
There's one guy I'm dying to get on Opie

3308
02:17:48,941 --> 02:17:49,900
and Anthony,
like I've met him.

3309
02:17:49,901 --> 02:17:51,820
I've spoken to him briefly.
He said he would do it.

3310
02:17:51,850 --> 02:17:52,900
He wouldn't.
He's never in New York.

3311
02:17:53,260 --> 02:17:53,980
Oh,
well,

3312
02:17:53,981 --> 02:17:56,110
you know what man?
You talked to Dana White.

3313
02:17:56,530 --> 02:17:58,600
Especially if he wins,
you know,

3314
02:17:58,601 --> 02:18:03,601
I'm sure they're going to want to put 
him on some crazy tort and even if he 

3315
02:18:03,601 --> 02:18:03,601
loses,
he'll do a tour.

3316
02:18:03,601 --> 02:18:03,760
I hope so.
Yeah.

3317
02:18:03,761 --> 02:18:05,680
He'll do a tour.
He's a bad motherfucker.

3318
02:18:05,681 --> 02:18:08,140
He's,
he's and he's a publicity machine.

3319
02:18:08,141 --> 02:18:09,580
That guy does everything.
It was funny.

3320
02:18:09,581 --> 02:18:11,110
I saw an interview you did with him 
where he goes,

3321
02:18:11,111 --> 02:18:12,880
I'm not that fight promotion.
And you're like,

3322
02:18:12,881 --> 02:18:16,090
well actually what are you doing?
Think my balls for calling him out on it

3323
02:18:16,091 --> 02:18:17,200
because very funny.
Well,

3324
02:18:17,201 --> 02:18:22,201
it's fun to hear him defend himself too,
because he has the best definitions of 

3325
02:18:22,201 --> 02:18:22,690
things where you just.
What he was talking about the fight,

3326
02:18:22,691 --> 02:18:23,650
like losing the fight.
He goes,

3327
02:18:23,651 --> 02:18:28,600
I did not lose to Anderson Silva.
I don't know where you come from,

3328
02:18:28,601 --> 02:18:32,830
but where I come from,
if you hold a man down and beat the shit

3329
02:18:32,831 --> 02:18:37,831
out of him for five rounds,
then he wraps his legs around your head 

3330
02:18:37,831 --> 02:18:39,580
for eight seconds and he wins.

3331
02:18:40,230 --> 02:18:42,190
Yeah.
He does have a great way of like,

3332
02:18:42,700 --> 02:18:45,190
how many fighters would take that 
approach?

3333
02:18:45,340 --> 02:18:50,340
I mean,
everybody else would take this approach 

3334
02:18:50,340 --> 02:18:50,340
of,
you know,

3335
02:18:50,340 --> 02:18:50,740
try to be humble or try to say,
you know,

3336
02:18:50,741 --> 02:18:51,220
well,
you know,

3337
02:18:51,221 --> 02:18:56,221
God puts a mysterious plans in front of 
me and I'm going to go back to the 

3338
02:18:56,221 --> 02:18:59,911
drawing board and see what I can do.
And instead he pretends that he's 

3339
02:18:59,911 --> 02:19:00,370
undefeated,
undisputed.

3340
02:19:00,520 --> 02:19:03,220
He brings a fake belt to the press 
conferences.

3341
02:19:03,440 --> 02:19:08,440
I mean,
he just takes things to a completely 

3342
02:19:08,440 --> 02:19:10,300
ridiculous and new and original level.
His level is very different.

3343
02:19:10,301 --> 02:19:13,270
Like his top trash talking,
in my opinion,

3344
02:19:13,271 --> 02:19:17,020
is so much more interesting than a guy 
like Muhammad Ali because Muhammad Ali's

3345
02:19:17,021 --> 02:19:21,640
trash-talking was at least he was being 
honest about his skills and he was being

3346
02:19:21,641 --> 02:19:26,641
honest about his past.
Like he's denying entire chapters is,

3347
02:19:27,670 --> 02:19:28,040
you know,

3348
02:19:28,090 --> 02:19:30,440
of his print,
his record undefeated.

3349
02:19:30,441 --> 02:19:32,900
Undisputed he says he's the champion.
It's funny,

3350
02:19:33,050 --> 02:19:35,120
just something really entertaining about
it,

3351
02:19:35,121 --> 02:19:36,650
but does that get distracting as a 
fighter?

3352
02:19:36,651 --> 02:19:41,651
Like when you're fighting,
do you get distracted or caught up in 

3353
02:19:41,651 --> 02:19:44,231
that out in the training camp,
but I wonder if that becomes a 

3354
02:19:44,231 --> 02:19:47,831
distraction at all because you know,
you're so busy building this kind of 

3355
02:19:47,831 --> 02:19:48,560
machine around you.
There's PR machine.

3356
02:19:48,970 --> 02:19:49,300
It's,
you know,

3357
02:19:49,340 --> 02:19:51,230
I mean I don't want to raise rocky three
is an example,

3358
02:19:51,580 --> 02:19:54,020
but I mean even though,
because he's on the losing end of it,

3359
02:19:54,021 --> 02:19:56,720
but it,
does that get distracting for a fighter?

3360
02:19:57,080 --> 02:19:58,670
It can.
It depends on the guy.

3361
02:19:58,700 --> 02:19:59,170
You know,
I,

3362
02:19:59,171 --> 02:20:02,890
I don't know how jail handles it,
you know,

3363
02:20:02,900 --> 02:20:07,900
but you think about how much trash you 
talked before the first Anderson Silva 

3364
02:20:07,900 --> 02:20:10,660
fight and he fought pretty fucking good.
But then again there's the talk that 

3365
02:20:10,660 --> 02:20:12,770
Anderson was injured,
her fight that he had an issue,

3366
02:20:13,070 --> 02:20:18,070
you know,
I don't know how much of it played a 

3367
02:20:18,070 --> 02:20:18,070
factor.

3368
02:20:18,070 --> 02:20:20,470
Anderson in the past has had issues with
some guys that were wrestlers like 

3369
02:20:20,470 --> 02:20:25,391
Travis Luder,
but that was another fight that he took 

3370
02:20:25,391 --> 02:20:28,061
injured.
I know for sure he was injured because 

3371
02:20:28,061 --> 02:20:30,641
his manager told me after that fight 
that Anderson had had meniscus surgery 

3372
02:20:30,641 --> 02:20:32,300
on both knees just five weeks before 
that fight.

3373
02:20:32,870 --> 02:20:33,950
It's incredible.
I mean,

3374
02:20:33,951 --> 02:20:38,090
the fact that he was able to have a cage
fight and defend the world title against

3375
02:20:38,091 --> 02:20:42,430
a tough guy like Travis Luder,
five weeks after meniscus surgery.

3376
02:20:42,440 --> 02:20:43,850
Cut your knee open man.
And they,

3377
02:20:44,020 --> 02:20:46,130
they trim out the,
a padded area.

3378
02:20:46,131 --> 02:20:50,090
Some of the padded area in between your 
knee gets broken up and torn,

3379
02:20:50,180 --> 02:20:53,330
especially doing Jujitsu and wrestling.
A lot of guys tear,

3380
02:20:53,680 --> 02:20:54,610
tear their,
uh,

3381
02:20:54,620 --> 02:20:56,600
their tissue inside their knee and they 
go in,

3382
02:20:56,601 --> 02:20:58,940
they scope it and they cleaned it up and
smooth it out.

3383
02:20:59,110 --> 02:21:00,860
And he kind of,
he fought five weeks later.

3384
02:21:00,920 --> 02:21:02,830
Have you had surgeries?
I've had that.

3385
02:21:02,831 --> 02:21:04,520
Yeah.
Five weeks later is incredible.

3386
02:21:04,550 --> 02:21:05,810
It's a fucking man.
Surgery.

3387
02:21:05,840 --> 02:21:07,700
Yeah.
Five weeks later it still hurts.

3388
02:21:07,790 --> 02:21:12,790
You know,
it's still sore when you get on your 

3389
02:21:12,790 --> 02:21:12,790
knees,
you know.

3390
02:21:12,790 --> 02:21:14,980
And this guy is fighting.
I had my turbinates shrunk recently and 

3391
02:21:14,980 --> 02:21:17,711
I felt like a warrior,
but they put the fucking needle in my 

3392
02:21:17,711 --> 02:21:17,711
nose.
So I can read a little bit better.

3393
02:21:17,711 --> 02:21:18,230
I felt good about that.
But you get the fuck out man.

3394
02:21:18,260 --> 02:21:19,910
Injuries did well.
I had the uh,

3395
02:21:19,911 --> 02:21:23,060
the nose thing too.
I had a deviated septum operation.

3396
02:21:23,061 --> 02:21:25,010
Let me test for a fucking brilliant 
thing.

3397
02:21:25,011 --> 02:21:30,011
That is that I'm so happy that doctors 
figured out a way to fix your fucking 

3398
02:21:30,011 --> 02:21:33,731
nose.
He can breathe out of it for people who 

3399
02:21:33,731 --> 02:21:33,731
have that issue and you can't breed that
he knows.

3400
02:21:33,770 --> 02:21:36,260
Take.
If you can set aside some time,

3401
02:21:36,261 --> 02:21:41,261
plan it out,
set aside some time to get that shit 

3402
02:21:41,261 --> 02:21:41,261
fixed.

3403
02:21:41,261 --> 02:21:41,270
My God,
that's a freeing feeling.

3404
02:21:41,420 --> 02:21:45,770
The first time I can go my whole life.
My nose was useless.

3405
02:21:45,771 --> 02:21:49,060
I broke my nose and I was like five.
So my whole life is like a terrible,

3406
02:21:49,580 --> 02:21:50,570
oh,
it's the worst.

3407
02:21:50,590 --> 02:21:52,160
You're going everywhere.
Not Breathing.

3408
02:21:52,180 --> 02:21:54,920
I wonder how many shitty decisions I've 
made in my life because I wasn't getting

3409
02:21:54,960 --> 02:21:57,560
enough oxygen.
Kidding,

3410
02:21:57,590 --> 02:22:02,590
man.
That was a mouth breather is the reason 

3411
02:22:02,590 --> 02:22:04,040
why they call people mouth breathers and
they think of them as idiots.

3412
02:22:04,041 --> 02:22:06,920
This mouth breathing fucking idiot.
It's because of your mouth is open.

3413
02:22:06,921 --> 02:22:11,921
You look like it,
it can't look like anything but a 

3414
02:22:11,921 --> 02:22:11,921
fucking dunce when your mouth is open.
Yeah,

3415
02:22:11,921 --> 02:22:13,580
you can't be a bad motherfucker.
You know,

3416
02:22:14,120 --> 02:22:16,540
like if your chicks blowing you and 
that's your face,

3417
02:22:16,810 --> 02:22:17,510
you're gonna,
you're gonna.

3418
02:22:18,030 --> 02:22:19,730
You're gonna fucking really turned her 
off.

3419
02:22:19,760 --> 02:22:21,390
I like to put a purposely awful face.

3420
02:22:21,390 --> 02:22:24,410
I want to get just a further.
The punishment.

3421
02:22:26,130 --> 02:22:28,440
There was a guy that used to post on my 
message board,

3422
02:22:28,680 --> 02:22:30,300
I don't know if he was telling the truth
or not.

3423
02:22:30,330 --> 02:22:35,330
It was a really interesting sort of a 
thing because the guy was obviously a 

3424
02:22:35,330 --> 02:22:38,451
very talented writer and he had a 
website where he would write about his 

3425
02:22:38,451 --> 02:22:40,820
encounters with women and he would set 
up these,

3426
02:22:40,830 --> 02:22:45,830
uh,
women who are low income women who 

3427
02:22:45,830 --> 02:22:45,830
needed money.
You mean easy women?

3428
02:22:45,900 --> 02:22:47,660
Slowly but surely he would,
uh,

3429
02:22:48,020 --> 02:22:53,020
um,
integrate himself into their lives and 

3430
02:22:53,020 --> 02:22:53,820
start a.
You like having them,

3431
02:22:53,870 --> 02:22:55,110
uh,
obligated to him,

3432
02:22:55,111 --> 02:22:57,440
like giving them an apartment,
sugar daddy shit.

3433
02:22:57,720 --> 02:23:00,960
But he would do it nice and slow and 
then he would start getting them to suck

3434
02:23:00,961 --> 02:23:02,010
his dick.
And that's how they,

3435
02:23:02,040 --> 02:23:04,170
that's how they started paying him 
because they didn't have any money.

3436
02:23:04,170 --> 02:23:09,170
Like he was gonna call the cops.
I mean this guy like would orchestrate 

3437
02:23:09,170 --> 02:23:11,590
it.
He would know that they couldn't afford 

3438
02:23:11,590 --> 02:23:13,551
things and set them up and even even 
loan them some money at first to get 

3439
02:23:13,551 --> 02:23:17,061
things rolling.
And then when they couldn't pay him 

3440
02:23:17,061 --> 02:23:17,061
back,
he would start saying,

3441
02:23:17,061 --> 02:23:17,061
listen,
we're going to work this out.

3442
02:23:17,061 --> 02:23:21,290
And he,
he would purposely make his diet 

3443
02:23:21,290 --> 02:23:24,440
disgusting.
He would eat asparagus and s and drink 

3444
02:23:24,440 --> 02:23:27,921
black coffee and he had like a bunch of 
different things that he would eat to 

3445
02:23:27,921 --> 02:23:31,110
purposely make his loads disgusting and 
cigarettes to some,

3446
02:23:31,111 --> 02:23:32,280
I think it was cigarettes.
Do you,

3447
02:23:32,370 --> 02:23:36,630
do you remember this guy did this?
Yeah,

3448
02:23:36,631 --> 02:23:41,631
people banned.
They banned them eventually from the 

3449
02:23:41,631 --> 02:23:41,631
message board because he was such a 
creep.

3450
02:23:41,631 --> 02:23:41,631
But yeah,
he,

3451
02:23:41,631 --> 02:23:41,631
you know,
he would have these.

3452
02:23:41,631 --> 02:23:43,980
Even if they weren't true stories,
they were brilliantly,

3453
02:23:44,100 --> 02:23:44,880
brilliantly written.

3454
02:23:45,060 --> 02:23:46,710
It was really interesting.
The writing,

3455
02:23:46,711 --> 02:23:51,711
I mean it was like,
it was like the inside the mind of a 

3456
02:23:51,711 --> 02:23:54,351
total sociopath that is just getting 
these poor girls and just doing crazy 

3457
02:23:54,351 --> 02:23:56,710
shit to them like coming inside the rass
and you know,

3458
02:23:56,880 --> 02:24:01,880
while they're,
while they're at work and doing it just 

3459
02:24:01,880 --> 02:24:01,880
nutty shit.
I forget what he did with everything was

3460
02:24:01,880 --> 02:24:04,230
like abuse.
Everything was like swallow his load.

3461
02:24:04,231 --> 02:24:09,231
After he ate all this asparagus,
everything was like he just wanted them 

3462
02:24:09,231 --> 02:24:11,400
to just feel completely demeaned and 
then he would move on and go to the next

3463
02:24:11,401 --> 02:24:16,401
place.
We had another girl set up channel like 

3464
02:24:16,401 --> 02:24:16,401
that.
Like I'm a pervert,

3465
02:24:16,401 --> 02:24:16,770
like I like to pay for it,
but I never,

3466
02:24:16,771 --> 02:24:21,771
I want it to be because we're coming to 
an understanding like I'm too average 

3467
02:24:21,771 --> 02:24:24,681
for you to fuck for free.
Like I don't like it to be predatory 

3468
02:24:24,681 --> 02:24:24,681
shit.

3469
02:24:24,681 --> 02:24:24,681
Like I don't like,
I don't like women are hurt.

3470
02:24:24,681 --> 02:24:29,211
I don't like when women feel demeaned.
Like I never want to go to field 

3471
02:24:29,211 --> 02:24:29,211
demeaned.
You have to take it.

3472
02:24:29,211 --> 02:24:29,211
Like I'll actually go,
Nah,

3473
02:24:29,211 --> 02:24:30,700
that's fine.
What exactly talking about?

3474
02:24:30,701 --> 02:24:31,980
Like it,
it's a great transaction.

3475
02:24:31,981 --> 02:24:34,470
We just had,
I never want them to feel degraded.

3476
02:24:34,590 --> 02:24:35,790
I don't degrade chicks.
I mean I'm,

3477
02:24:35,791 --> 02:24:39,020
I'm a fucking pervert and I like a big 
neat pussy and I'm,

3478
02:24:39,610 --> 02:24:42,360
that's all I want.
I never want them to feel bad about it.

3479
02:24:42,390 --> 02:24:43,560
It,
it's a funny thing man,

3480
02:24:43,561 --> 02:24:46,230
because really if they had,
if they had sex with you for free,

3481
02:24:46,231 --> 02:24:47,880
there's nothing wrong with it.
You know,

3482
02:24:47,910 --> 02:24:49,530
if they decided to give you a blow job 
for free,

3483
02:24:49,531 --> 02:24:51,000
people do it all day,
all over the world.

3484
02:24:51,240 --> 02:24:53,310
But if somehow or another you give them 
some money,

3485
02:24:53,460 --> 02:24:58,460
then then it becomes a terrible thing 
that there are moral and they've made a 

3486
02:24:58,460 --> 02:24:58,890
decision to get sex for money.
Well,

3487
02:24:59,130 --> 02:25:04,130
people always done that,
but women have done that throughout 

3488
02:25:04,130 --> 02:25:04,130
history.
You know,

3489
02:25:04,130 --> 02:25:05,700
there's a lot of ugly dudes.
It's pretty women.

3490
02:25:05,701 --> 02:25:07,590
Fuck yeah man.
There's nothing wrong with that.

3491
02:25:07,630 --> 02:25:09,000
Now.
Thank God for that.

3492
02:25:09,870 --> 02:25:13,680
Pick up chicks on my fucking marriage.
I never fucked a hot chick on my mirror.

3493
02:25:13,681 --> 02:25:17,400
So what should we be able to go after a 
sugar daddies?

3494
02:25:17,440 --> 02:25:20,520
Should we show her women who married 
sugar daddies?

3495
02:25:20,640 --> 02:25:22,070
When you see a 20 year old chick,
Marion,

3496
02:25:22,071 --> 02:25:23,410
a 55 year old dude,

3497
02:25:24,190 --> 02:25:25,300
should we do,
should we,

3498
02:25:25,340 --> 02:25:30,340
uh,
should we go after them or is that a 

3499
02:25:30,340 --> 02:25:32,881
prostitute?
How could you possibly be attracted to 

3500
02:25:32,881 --> 02:25:32,881
him?
You just want his money.

3501
02:25:32,881 --> 02:25:32,881
What did he buy you?
Oh,

3502
02:25:32,881 --> 02:25:35,740
we bought you this prostitute right now 
of a guy.

3503
02:25:35,770 --> 02:25:38,740
Gives a girl watch to fucker.
Is that prostitution?

3504
02:25:38,770 --> 02:25:39,880
What does it mean?
Get slippery?

3505
02:25:39,990 --> 02:25:40,930
Yeah.
Very,

3506
02:25:40,931 --> 02:25:45,931
very slippery.
You mind if I let you fuck me in the 

3507
02:25:45,931 --> 02:25:45,931
ass?
What do you want?

3508
02:25:45,931 --> 02:25:47,530
Yeah,
how many do you want to take tickets?

3509
02:25:48,070 --> 02:25:50,050
There's a watch that I really love.
Show me it.

3510
02:25:50,320 --> 02:25:52,540
Show me right now and like,
all right,

3511
02:25:52,541 --> 02:25:55,690
we got it.
That is the same as a cash transaction.

3512
02:25:55,780 --> 02:25:57,630
It is,
it's prostitution.

3513
02:25:57,700 --> 02:25:59,290
Men Do that with their wives all the 
time,

3514
02:25:59,291 --> 02:26:01,270
but a watch costs more like at least for
me,

3515
02:26:01,271 --> 02:26:02,300
$300.
I'm out.

3516
02:26:02,490 --> 02:26:04,060
Fuck you gonna buy somebody.
I'll watch.

3517
02:26:04,090 --> 02:26:09,090
What is the standard going rate for like
is that for getting jerked off as that 

3518
02:26:09,090 --> 02:26:10,150
for getting blown?
300 bucks.

3519
02:26:10,151 --> 02:26:11,440
What is it?
Three and four.

3520
02:26:11,441 --> 02:26:16,441
It depends.
If the girls are massage therapist and 

3521
02:26:16,441 --> 02:26:18,271
not an escort,
sometimes you can get jerked off for 

3522
02:26:18,271 --> 02:26:18,271
three slash 50.
I spend more than I should,

3523
02:26:18,271 --> 02:26:18,490
but I figured,
you know what,

3524
02:26:18,491 --> 02:26:19,960
I'm not going to knock a checkup doing 
that.

3525
02:26:19,961 --> 02:26:24,961
I'm not going to know.
There's gonna be no horrible 

3526
02:26:24,961 --> 02:26:26,990
repercussions from doing that because 
uh,

3527
02:26:27,280 --> 02:26:32,280
the amount of money you pay,
if you fucking get somebody pregnant is 

3528
02:26:32,280 --> 02:26:32,410
18 years,
20 years of tuition and all that.

3529
02:26:32,620 --> 02:26:37,620
Fuck that man.
Do you feel weird about letting them 

3530
02:26:37,620 --> 02:26:37,620
come to your house?
No.

3531
02:26:37,620 --> 02:26:37,620
No,
no.

3532
02:26:37,620 --> 02:26:38,350
I love him at my house.
It's my space.

3533
02:26:38,860 --> 02:26:40,840
I know that there's nobody going to film
me.

3534
02:26:40,841 --> 02:26:43,390
I know that nobody's going to take a uh,
rob me.

3535
02:26:43,440 --> 02:26:46,510
I know I'm in a secure building.
I had the security of my building.

3536
02:26:46,511 --> 02:26:49,720
This fucking a concierge.
It's a very secure place.

3537
02:26:49,750 --> 02:26:54,750
Did you get a place and think about the 
fact that you're going to bring escorts 

3538
02:26:54,750 --> 02:26:56,770
back to it so you need certain things 
set up it.

3539
02:26:56,840 --> 02:27:01,840
Everything I've ever done is somehow or 
how many got horse in my house that has 

3540
02:27:01,840 --> 02:27:01,840
an underground garage.
I'm like,

3541
02:27:01,840 --> 02:27:06,361
good,
because I fucking training with the 

3542
02:27:06,361 --> 02:27:07,621
blonde hair.
I can't have her coming through the 

3543
02:27:07,621 --> 02:27:07,621
lobby.
You always gotta think of that Shit.

3544
02:27:07,621 --> 02:27:08,620
Sure.
That's hilarious man.

3545
02:27:08,830 --> 02:27:10,870
But I did the building.
I actually just love it.

3546
02:27:10,871 --> 02:27:14,080
I did think that's great that there's 
security there because while I liked the

3547
02:27:14,081 --> 02:27:16,270
idea of people not knowing my comings 
and goings,

3548
02:27:16,271 --> 02:27:21,271
I like being safe more and now you're 
not going to have anybody act up at a 

3549
02:27:21,271 --> 02:27:21,400
building with security unless you get 
out of line.

3550
02:27:21,400 --> 02:27:26,400
But normally they're not going to act up
because they just want to get the money 

3551
02:27:26,400 --> 02:27:26,400
and fucking go.
Right.

3552
02:27:26,400 --> 02:27:28,120
I've had a couple.
I had a scary experience one time I went

3553
02:27:28,121 --> 02:27:31,660
to a house to get like jerked off years 
ago.

3554
02:27:31,661 --> 02:27:36,661
It was right off second avenue and I 
walked in and it was like really dark 

3555
02:27:36,661 --> 02:27:40,501
and she was shady and she was holding a 
screwdriver and I went to piss and there

3556
02:27:40,511 --> 02:27:45,511
was like a really weird water in the tub
and there was like Burger King rappers 

3557
02:27:45,511 --> 02:27:45,511
in it.
And uh,

3558
02:27:45,511 --> 02:27:49,960
there was fruit flies and I sat down and
it was dark and the rest of the room,

3559
02:27:49,961 --> 02:27:52,450
it was a messy house,
like a railroad apartment in New York.

3560
02:27:53,080 --> 02:27:58,080
And I felt that something very evil was 
in the room and I very rarely if ever 

3561
02:27:58,421 --> 02:28:03,421
get that feeling,
but I knew there was somebody else in 

3562
02:28:03,421 --> 02:28:03,421
the room with us and they were just in 
the back,

3563
02:28:03,421 --> 02:28:07,741
like looking through a door,
I could sense that there was a person 

3564
02:28:07,741 --> 02:28:07,741
there,
so,

3565
02:28:07,741 --> 02:28:08,080
uh,
and she was holding this screwdriver the

3566
02:28:08,081 --> 02:28:11,080
whole time and I just started to get 
very scared,

3567
02:28:11,081 --> 02:28:14,410
like we have these instincts and I 
listened to my instincts and I'm like,

3568
02:28:14,411 --> 02:28:15,260
look,
uh,

3569
02:28:15,280 --> 02:28:16,030
I'm sick.

3570
02:28:16,090 --> 02:28:21,090
I can't do this.
But I paid her the money and I just 

3571
02:28:21,090 --> 02:28:21,090
left.
And I knew I had.

3572
02:28:21,090 --> 02:28:23,150
I had dodged a bullet because her hands 
were dirty.

3573
02:28:23,390 --> 02:28:28,390
There was something that was one of the 
scariest moments in my life because I 

3574
02:28:28,390 --> 02:28:29,200
couldn't see who was the apartment was 
again.

3575
02:28:29,210 --> 02:28:30,920
It was really a little bit lit when I 
walked in,

3576
02:28:31,770 --> 02:28:33,800
when I gave him the money,
she went to the door and open it.

3577
02:28:33,920 --> 02:28:35,780
She might've just faked handing it to 
somebody,

3578
02:28:36,080 --> 02:28:38,300
but my sense that somebody was in that 
room with us was very,

3579
02:28:38,301 --> 02:28:43,301
very strong.
So that was a case and that's why I 

3580
02:28:43,301 --> 02:28:45,010
don't go to places where I think there 
are a lot of them would have Sony in the

3581
02:28:45,011 --> 02:28:50,011
movie,
the room with them just for protection 

3582
02:28:50,011 --> 02:28:50,011
or next door.
Yeah.

3583
02:28:50,011 --> 02:28:50,011
A lot of them do,
do,

3584
02:28:50,011 --> 02:28:50,330
a lot of them do,
do that,

3585
02:28:50,331 --> 02:28:52,160
but I don't think that there'll be a 
smart thing to do.

3586
02:28:52,160 --> 02:28:52,790
No.
Yeah.

3587
02:28:52,791 --> 02:28:54,530
Well they have them within shouting 
distance.

3588
02:28:54,770 --> 02:28:59,770
But uh,
there was something extra to have them 

3589
02:28:59,770 --> 02:29:00,800
in the room because you just threatened 
me with a screwdriver.

3590
02:29:00,801 --> 02:29:05,801
Mr.
Fifty extra for the Philips has dirty 

3591
02:29:05,801 --> 02:29:05,801
hands who said yeah,
she was just dirty.

3592
02:29:05,801 --> 02:29:10,431
It was something fucking shady going on.
I knew it and I felt that I had done 

3593
02:29:10,431 --> 02:29:10,640
that enough times to know when something
was off,

3594
02:29:10,970 --> 02:29:15,970
something was really off and that's why 
people get killed because they don't 

3595
02:29:15,970 --> 02:29:15,970
listen to that instinct.
Wow.

3596
02:29:15,970 --> 02:29:20,651
Um,
and I listened to it and I'm not saying 

3597
02:29:20,651 --> 02:29:20,651
I was going to get killed,
but something bad was gonna happen.

3598
02:29:20,651 --> 02:29:23,420
And I absolutely know it.
And then how long did it take before you

3599
02:29:23,421 --> 02:29:25,010
wanted to get laid again?
After that?

3600
02:29:25,080 --> 02:29:29,030
I probably acted out the next day.
My Dick didn't know what happened.

3601
02:29:29,200 --> 02:29:30,180
Like,
Hey,

3602
02:29:32,030 --> 02:29:35,600
actually man up plus he,
Jesus Christ.

3603
02:29:35,660 --> 02:29:37,290
That was scary.
Yeah.

3604
02:29:37,370 --> 02:29:38,210
How did you,
uh,

3605
02:29:38,330 --> 02:29:40,340
how did you get out of there?
I just,

3606
02:29:40,341 --> 02:29:43,160
I said I think I like,
I have cancer and I'm not feeling well.

3607
02:29:43,161 --> 02:29:44,730
And I,
all cancer think I said,

3608
02:29:45,120 --> 02:29:46,570
I said some really like I have cancer.
I'm,

3609
02:29:46,571 --> 02:29:51,571
I feeling for some really weird thing.
I didn't want to spook her.

3610
02:29:51,760 --> 02:29:52,100
Uh,
she,

3611
02:29:52,101 --> 02:29:54,170
I remember she had a blonde hair.
It was a wig,

3612
02:29:54,550 --> 02:29:59,550
something so wrong.
There was something so raw with,

3613
02:30:00,170 --> 02:30:03,470
with what was happening in that house.
And it was just such a gut instinct that

3614
02:30:03,471 --> 02:30:06,090
it wasn't just,
there was something fucking.

3615
02:30:06,200 --> 02:30:07,610
I had a friend who,
uh,

3616
02:30:07,670 --> 02:30:10,010
he,
after he broke up with a girl,

3617
02:30:10,570 --> 02:30:15,570
they stayed in touch and they agreed to 
a form of prostitution because she was 

3618
02:30:17,331 --> 02:30:18,220
like,
you know,

3619
02:30:18,320 --> 02:30:22,520
she always had like shitty jobs.
She always needed money and she said she

3620
02:30:22,521 --> 02:30:24,590
couldn't have a relationship with him 
anymore.

3621
02:30:24,590 --> 02:30:28,250
She was past it,
but she would come over and let him fuck

3622
02:30:28,251 --> 02:30:30,860
her or she would suck his dick and he 
would give her money.

3623
02:30:30,920 --> 02:30:32,510
It's crazy.
I became,

3624
02:30:32,540 --> 02:30:35,330
became a weird sort of a prostitution 
thing.

3625
02:30:35,331 --> 02:30:40,331
It's like,
it really freaked him out when he was 

3626
02:30:40,331 --> 02:30:40,331
telling a story.
It's like,

3627
02:30:40,331 --> 02:30:42,560
it started off as like she needed to 
borrow money and she asked me and I said

3628
02:30:42,790 --> 02:30:43,850
yes,
come on over.

3629
02:30:44,180 --> 02:30:48,230
And then somehow or another he gave her 
the money and then they fucked,

3630
02:30:48,260 --> 02:30:49,040
like she,
like,

3631
02:30:49,250 --> 02:30:51,020
you know,
thanked him by blowing them or something

3632
02:30:51,021 --> 02:30:53,390
like that and you know,
and she said,

3633
02:30:53,420 --> 02:30:54,080
you know,
something like,

3634
02:30:54,081 --> 02:30:55,640
you know,
we can do this anytime,

3635
02:30:55,920 --> 02:30:57,530
you know,
anytime you want to do that,

3636
02:30:57,950 --> 02:30:58,970
you know,
as a,

3637
02:30:58,971 --> 02:31:01,250
I always need money,
like joking around.

3638
02:31:01,490 --> 02:31:03,200
And I think he gets grabbed and said,
listen,

3639
02:31:03,440 --> 02:31:04,640
listen,
we don't have to.

3640
02:31:04,940 --> 02:31:06,110
There's nothing wrong with this.
I'll,

3641
02:31:06,200 --> 02:31:07,270
I'll make you a deal.
You know,

3642
02:31:07,380 --> 02:31:09,500
I'll pay you x amount of money and you 
come.

3643
02:31:09,530 --> 02:31:11,650
And so like he turned her into his 
brain.

3644
02:31:11,740 --> 02:31:13,670
Is that if you're looking for new 
clients,

3645
02:31:14,090 --> 02:31:17,450
I would love to have someone who is not 
really a prostitute though.

3646
02:31:17,480 --> 02:31:22,480
She's only doing it with her ex and she 
says so she says she will fucking branch

3647
02:31:22,861 --> 02:31:26,520
out franchise.
That shit.

3648
02:31:26,560 --> 02:31:27,420
This was,
by the way,

3649
02:31:27,421 --> 02:31:31,470
this was over a decade ago,
changed her ways,

3650
02:31:31,471 --> 02:31:33,210
but it was a great story when he was 
doing it,

3651
02:31:33,211 --> 02:31:35,190
like while it was going down I was like,
wow,

3652
02:31:35,250 --> 02:31:40,250
that is nuts.
So I couldn't do it with my ex 

3653
02:31:40,250 --> 02:31:42,581
girlfriend cause I loved her too much,
but I could do it with girls I've dated 

3654
02:31:42,581 --> 02:31:43,320
in my life like any extra effort was 
with for a year and a half.

3655
02:31:43,321 --> 02:31:48,321
I could never do that because I would 
just feel too sad for them by what if 

3656
02:31:48,321 --> 02:31:48,810
it's a real nice exchange.

3657
02:31:48,810 --> 02:31:53,810
Like you don't feel sad for the regular 
prostitute that doesn't even know you 

3658
02:31:53,810 --> 02:31:54,060
don't want her to feel bad seeing her 
and fucking or again,

3659
02:31:54,061 --> 02:31:55,290
that will bring back.
You know,

3660
02:31:55,380 --> 02:31:57,540
we just couldn't do it.
I would feel too.

3661
02:31:57,550 --> 02:31:58,800
Yeah,
that's true.

3662
02:31:59,070 --> 02:32:00,580
However,
get a couple of drinks in.

3663
02:32:00,581 --> 02:32:01,330
Yeah,
you'd be fine.

3664
02:32:01,980 --> 02:32:03,720
No,
but a girl who I've just met once,

3665
02:32:03,750 --> 02:32:07,560
like there's one girl who I met through 
a friend once who I wound up fucking.

3666
02:32:07,561 --> 02:32:12,561
I wanted her for years and I finally got
the fucking like eat her ass for money 

3667
02:32:12,561 --> 02:32:13,590
and that was awesome.
That was awesome.

3668
02:32:14,190 --> 02:32:19,190
Do you wash it off?
How do you handle the eating the ass to 

3669
02:32:19,190 --> 02:32:19,190
do?
How do you wash it off?

3670
02:32:19,190 --> 02:32:19,950
You could put the fuck.
Is he watching?

3671
02:32:19,951 --> 02:32:20,580
Oh,
what do you get?

3672
02:32:20,581 --> 02:32:22,550
Scraped cheese on your pizza.
Fuck it enough.

3673
02:32:24,870 --> 02:32:29,430
Oh my goodness.
Was that no dive right in?

3674
02:32:29,490 --> 02:32:30,560
If it's,
again,

3675
02:32:30,570 --> 02:32:33,510
it's rare that it's going to be filthy.
If it's a little.

3676
02:32:33,511 --> 02:32:35,310
I've had a couple of fucking damaged 
ones,

3677
02:32:35,311 --> 02:32:37,260
but normally there normally they're 
good.

3678
02:32:37,320 --> 02:32:39,870
When you're doing the damage,
just fucked off back away.

3679
02:32:40,410 --> 02:32:42,480
Maybe I'll clean up the problem or kiss 
the cheeks.

3680
02:32:42,940 --> 02:32:44,990
Turn Up.
Sometimes you have to.

3681
02:32:45,040 --> 02:32:46,390
Don't eat the ass.
If it's dirty,

3682
02:32:46,920 --> 02:32:48,510
it's filthy.
It smells moist.

3683
02:32:48,511 --> 02:32:51,480
Like I've had a few of those.
You can't do that.

3684
02:32:51,510 --> 02:32:56,510
I've had a fuser they grab you then.
Have you ever gotten sick from eating 

3685
02:32:56,510 --> 02:32:56,510
ass?
No,

3686
02:32:56,510 --> 02:33:00,600
but once years ago I worked at caldor 
and now when I was in 1997 and there was

3687
02:33:00,601 --> 02:33:04,260
a girl who worked in the housewares 
department and she came over and we were

3688
02:33:04,261 --> 02:33:08,130
doing inventory and she let me eat her 
pussy and I didn't want it to fuck for a

3689
02:33:08,131 --> 02:33:09,250
long time,
but she had bad breath.

3690
02:33:09,250 --> 02:33:10,400
Her breasts,
like corn.

3691
02:33:11,040 --> 02:33:16,040
It was like she hadn't eaten in a month 
and it was just a kernel of corn riding 

3692
02:33:16,040 --> 02:33:16,220
in her stomach,
like ever smell corn breath pull.

3693
02:33:16,680 --> 02:33:18,060
I pulled.
She had pantyhose on,

3694
02:33:18,061 --> 02:33:23,061
which is a bad sign when you're doing 
inventory and our pussy fucking re and I

3695
02:33:23,580 --> 02:33:28,200
went down and it was so foul that I 
think I retched,

3696
02:33:29,130 --> 02:33:34,130
but I did go through with it.
I am nothing if not a fucking 

3697
02:33:34,130 --> 02:33:36,720
professional is the one that is the 
worst.

3698
02:33:36,721 --> 02:33:41,721
This too,
too terrible smells that are under 

3699
02:33:41,721 --> 02:33:43,760
three.
The dead body smell tell human dead 

3700
02:33:43,760 --> 02:33:43,760
bodies.
It's just unbelievably bad.

3701
02:33:43,760 --> 02:33:47,750
That's mother nature,
telling you to get the fuck away from 

3702
02:33:47,750 --> 02:33:48,240
that thing and then there's the smell of
bad pussy and shit,

3703
02:33:48,330 --> 02:33:51,000
which are really close,
like a use infection,

3704
02:33:51,090 --> 02:33:52,950
like a horrible smelling yeast 
infection.

3705
02:33:53,280 --> 02:33:56,910
There's almost something more disgusting
about that smell than a shit smell.

3706
02:33:56,940 --> 02:33:57,510
Oh yeah.
Vista.

3707
02:33:57,520 --> 02:34:02,520
When you fucking and you see that milk,
when you see that frame coding and you 

3708
02:34:02,520 --> 02:34:05,130
just,
it just begins to really reconnect sour.

3709
02:34:05,131 --> 02:34:06,150
Yeah.
That's a terrible,

3710
02:34:06,151 --> 02:34:07,830
terrible smell.
Oh Man.

3711
02:34:07,890 --> 02:34:09,800
That's an awful smell.
It stinks.

3712
02:34:09,820 --> 02:34:11,460
So how do you not know that's coming out
here?

3713
02:34:11,730 --> 02:34:16,730
Well,
the thing about smells is that 

3714
02:34:16,730 --> 02:34:16,730
especially um,
grow smells like all,

3715
02:34:17,140 --> 02:34:22,140
all factory sensors detect change.
I don't think they detect like steady 

3716
02:34:22,451 --> 02:34:27,451
smells.
That's why people live in places where 

3717
02:34:27,451 --> 02:34:28,960
those factories and shit or you know,
my parents lived near.

3718
02:34:28,961 --> 02:34:32,280
I'm a cow.
A places.

3719
02:34:32,350 --> 02:34:33,940
Yeah.
Cow poop where the,

3720
02:34:34,010 --> 02:34:37,540
they raised like a fucking shitload of 
cattle on this one road.

3721
02:34:37,750 --> 02:34:40,510
And every time you drive by this robe 
you smells couch.

3722
02:34:40,890 --> 02:34:42,750
These girls are just doing it all their 
whole life.

3723
02:34:42,751 --> 02:34:44,650
They've just had dirty pussies.
Well,

3724
02:34:44,651 --> 02:34:49,110
I know one girl that I knew when I was 
young who had a real problem and

3725
02:34:49,640 --> 02:34:54,640
she was a,
I think her parents just kind of raised 

3726
02:34:54,640 --> 02:34:58,571
her like or like in a box,
like they didn't talk to her about 

3727
02:34:58,571 --> 02:35:01,121
anything sexual and she didn't know what
the fuck was going on and her box was a 

3728
02:35:01,121 --> 02:35:01,121
mess.
I mean for,

3729
02:35:01,121 --> 02:35:04,550
for like years this girl had on and off 
yeast infections.

3730
02:35:04,600 --> 02:35:07,750
You that she was molested and kept it 
dirty on purposely a lot of times.

3731
02:35:07,751 --> 02:35:09,680
Oh,
a lot of chicks get really fat too.

3732
02:35:09,681 --> 02:35:14,681
A lot of chicks don't want that pussy to
be good because I don't want you to be 

3733
02:35:14,681 --> 02:35:14,681
attracted to them.
So a lot of girls.

3734
02:35:14,681 --> 02:35:17,540
But I do have your ass dirty just in 
case.

3735
02:35:17,541 --> 02:35:22,541
They of course have heard that with 
women that there's women that overeat 

3736
02:35:22,541 --> 02:35:26,081
because of that.
They're trying to make themselves look 

3737
02:35:26,081 --> 02:35:26,081
on the track.
I won't fuck you.

3738
02:35:26,081 --> 02:35:27,950
Fuck a fatty ever.
But somebody with a bad pussy.

3739
02:35:27,950 --> 02:35:29,420
It depends.
If it's like a yeast infection,

3740
02:35:29,421 --> 02:35:30,140
bad.
No,

3741
02:35:30,530 --> 02:35:32,530
but sweaty can be again.
Yeah,

3742
02:35:32,531 --> 02:35:33,980
right now the gym,
who cares?

3743
02:35:34,200 --> 02:35:39,200
I don't fucking right in the fucking 
miles you run a little piss smell to it,

3744
02:35:42,290 --> 02:35:47,290
but shit,
that's where you draw the line a little 

3745
02:35:47,290 --> 02:35:47,750
bit.
Not a lot,

3746
02:35:48,110 --> 02:35:49,820
but a little bit.
It's an animal thing,

3747
02:35:49,821 --> 02:35:52,560
man.
I can't believe you like the underarms,

3748
02:35:52,580 --> 02:35:54,380
distinct.
It's a strange thing,

3749
02:35:54,650 --> 02:35:59,650
but it's raw.
Like I remember like even when I smoked 

3750
02:35:59,650 --> 02:35:59,650
my,
uh,

3751
02:35:59,650 --> 02:36:01,340
my nose has always been a very vegan.
I was a kid.

3752
02:36:01,341 --> 02:36:04,400
I used to lay on my back and my friend 
and his sister,

3753
02:36:04,401 --> 02:36:09,401
I was in like first grade,
she was in second grade and he was in 

3754
02:36:09,401 --> 02:36:09,401
Migraine.
She was a year older than us and I would

3755
02:36:09,401 --> 02:36:12,950
get them to sit on my face in their 
pants because they both would piss their

3756
02:36:12,951 --> 02:36:15,630
pants a lot.
I guess they had mortifying home life.

3757
02:36:15,830 --> 02:36:18,110
Apparently somebody yelled a lot in the 
house,

3758
02:36:19,160 --> 02:36:24,160
tinkle in their crotch.
And so I would lay on my back and have 

3759
02:36:24,160 --> 02:36:25,700
them fucking put their crotch over my 
face and I would smell it.

3760
02:36:25,701 --> 02:36:27,300
I just love the smell.
I was like,

3761
02:36:27,530 --> 02:36:28,700
I swear to God,
I,

3762
02:36:28,720 --> 02:36:33,720
I remembered that I would lay behind the
shrubs and have the fucking sit on my 

3763
02:36:33,720 --> 02:36:34,340
face.

3764
02:36:34,990 --> 02:36:36,550
I,
I used to do something as a kid.

3765
02:36:36,551 --> 02:36:38,280
I don't know if I told you this before,
but I know you're a,

3766
02:36:38,281 --> 02:36:39,770
you love Pete,
but I,

3767
02:36:39,820 --> 02:36:44,440
the girl that always wanted me to fuck 
her in the shower and then pee inside of

3768
02:36:44,441 --> 02:36:46,440
her because it felt like I was coming in
or,

3769
02:36:46,960 --> 02:36:49,270
and if you ever done that,
not

3770
02:36:49,270 --> 02:36:51,200
in the,
I don't like shower sex because I have,

3771
02:36:51,250 --> 02:36:56,250
I'm so high maintenance.
I have to be fucking a certain way and 

3772
02:36:56,250 --> 02:36:56,340
keys my nipples and it's hard for me to 
peanut chick.

3773
02:36:56,560 --> 02:36:57,760
Um,
I've pissed on girls,

3774
02:36:57,761 --> 02:36:59,800
but it's hard for me to pee in a,
in a girl because,

3775
02:36:59,801 --> 02:37:04,801
uh,
it's just such a different sensation to 

3776
02:37:04,801 --> 02:37:06,901
me.
But I would love to be able to admire 

3777
02:37:06,901 --> 02:37:06,901
the,
irritates the tip.

3778
02:37:06,901 --> 02:37:09,780
I wonder how many women were listening 
to this podcast right up as a point 

3779
02:37:09,780 --> 02:37:09,910
where you got to tease my nipples.
I'm like,

3780
02:37:09,911 --> 02:37:11,290
that's it.
That's it.

3781
02:37:11,470 --> 02:37:13,070
I've lost a lot of.
I'm done.

3782
02:37:14,320 --> 02:37:17,120
I can't listen this guy,
but you know what,

3783
02:37:17,150 --> 02:37:21,200
I'll tell you what I do and what I say 
and I talk about it as they say.

3784
02:37:21,201 --> 02:37:24,950
It weeds out all non hackers who don't 
pack the gear to serve my beloved core.

3785
02:37:25,220 --> 02:37:27,920
Anybody who is not going to fucking show
up to play,

3786
02:37:28,250 --> 02:37:33,250
I,
I probably weed out 90 percent of the 

3787
02:37:33,250 --> 02:37:35,681
women that would go out with me,
but the 10 percent that show up are 

3788
02:37:35,681 --> 02:37:35,690
fucking troopers.
Right?

3789
02:37:35,750 --> 02:37:37,670
And those are the ones.
And you're famous.

3790
02:37:37,671 --> 02:37:38,950
Now,
do it.

3791
02:37:38,951 --> 02:37:39,650
Okay.
I mean,

3792
02:37:39,651 --> 02:37:40,930
I'm doing well.
I'm not famous yet.

3793
02:37:41,010 --> 02:37:42,170
You're famous.
Listen,

3794
02:37:42,171 --> 02:37:43,280
I don't feel silly.
Boy,

3795
02:37:44,510 --> 02:37:46,070
you're famous.
You're famous.

3796
02:37:46,190 --> 02:37:47,570
You're on the opiod.
Anthony show.

3797
02:37:47,780 --> 02:37:52,780
Do you know the opening?
Anthony shows one of the greatest radio 

3798
02:37:52,780 --> 02:37:52,780
shows in the history of the world.
Thank you.

3799
02:37:52,780 --> 02:37:52,780
I do.
You're a reason.

3800
02:37:53,030 --> 02:37:58,030
You're a big part of that.
You've made me fucking house more times 

3801
02:37:58,030 --> 02:37:59,660
driving around in my car than any human 
alive.

3802
02:37:59,900 --> 02:38:00,960
That is a fact.
Oh,

3803
02:38:00,970 --> 02:38:02,500
thanks.
There's 100 times.

3804
02:38:02,510 --> 02:38:04,040
I mean,
I can't tell you how many times I called

3805
02:38:04,041 --> 02:38:07,910
you or texted you.
A particular lines that killed me on the

3806
02:38:07,911 --> 02:38:08,090
show.

3807
02:38:08,090 --> 02:38:09,110
You're famous,
you know,

3808
02:38:09,111 --> 02:38:10,550
it's,
it's a weird thing.

3809
02:38:10,551 --> 02:38:14,240
It's a thing that people don't like to 
say because you sound like a Douche bag,

3810
02:38:14,500 --> 02:38:15,200
you know,
when you say,

3811
02:38:15,201 --> 02:38:16,460
yeah,
well I know I'm famous,

3812
02:38:16,461 --> 02:38:21,461
you know,
it sounds gross and it feels gross even 

3813
02:38:21,461 --> 02:38:21,461
think about it,
but you know,

3814
02:38:21,470 --> 02:38:25,820
but what my point is you are and you're 
famous for being a pervert.

3815
02:38:26,030 --> 02:38:31,030
So it's like it's all out on the table.
So it's not like you might have cut out 

3816
02:38:31,030 --> 02:38:33,670
the amount of women that would a date 
you buy,

3817
02:38:33,671 --> 02:38:34,910
you know,
90 percent.

3818
02:38:35,090 --> 02:38:40,090
But those 10 percent you have 57,000
percent more of them.

3819
02:38:40,490 --> 02:38:41,260
Yeah,
no.

3820
02:38:41,320 --> 02:38:41,960
Right,
right,

3821
02:38:41,961 --> 02:38:42,380
right.
Okay.

3822
02:38:42,530 --> 02:38:46,700
The numbers are staggeringly in your 
favor because if you were like a regular

3823
02:38:46,701 --> 02:38:49,760
dude that never got famous and kept all 
this shit hidden,

3824
02:38:50,240 --> 02:38:55,240
it would be really hard to find exactly 
what you're looking for and the ones 

3825
02:38:55,240 --> 02:38:55,690
that you lose that are really pretty or 
really cool.

3826
02:38:56,020 --> 02:38:57,590
And there's been some that I'm like,
fuck man,

3827
02:38:57,591 --> 02:38:59,930
I blow it.
But it's like she would have been,

3828
02:38:59,960 --> 02:39:04,960
we would have had an awful sexual 
relationship anyway because I know what 

3829
02:39:04,960 --> 02:39:08,051
I like and you don't have to be filthy,
but you've got to be kind of open and 

3830
02:39:08,051 --> 02:39:09,080
willing to at least like.
I like talking about a lot of stuff that

3831
02:39:09,081 --> 02:39:14,081
I don't like to just sex.
You're not hurting anybody feel like 

3832
02:39:14,081 --> 02:39:14,081
you're talking about a chick fucking 
other guys.

3833
02:39:14,081 --> 02:39:17,630
Like I love him and she tells me she'd 
rather be fucking another guy.

3834
02:39:17,660 --> 02:39:20,450
I'd tell them to pretend they don't even
know what a Dick looks like.

3835
02:39:22,280 --> 02:39:23,780
Oh my God.
It's so pretty.

3836
02:39:24,380 --> 02:39:28,190
I don't think I know how to suck.
Why should I try?

3837
02:39:28,220 --> 02:39:30,020
Would you want me to try?
Yeah,

3838
02:39:30,021 --> 02:39:35,021
go ahead and try and make him play dead.
I pretend that they'd been in a 

3839
02:39:35,021 --> 02:39:37,250
hermetically sealed pouch for 30 years.

3840
02:39:37,490 --> 02:39:42,490
Now I like to make a girl watch 
something rather fucking tell me how 

3841
02:39:42,490 --> 02:39:43,570
she'd rather be.
Yeah.

3842
02:39:43,840 --> 02:39:46,040
I need a little dose of humiliation is 
straightened me out,

3843
02:39:46,041 --> 02:39:49,580
man.
You're so honest about though.

3844
02:39:49,581 --> 02:39:54,581
It's so much fun.
You must get the craziest girls that 

3845
02:39:54,581 --> 02:39:54,581
come up to you now.
Don't you?

3846
02:39:54,581 --> 02:39:55,670
You get a good amount like I can.
I really.

3847
02:39:55,700 --> 02:39:57,830
I hate to even.
I didn't talk about it.

3848
02:39:57,831 --> 02:40:01,190
I just on this last tour I did because 
I've talked about it so much,

3849
02:40:01,191 --> 02:40:06,191
but I like big pussy.
I've always joked about that thick 

3850
02:40:06,191 --> 02:40:08,630
lipstick lips in a fucking,
a big click like it drives me.

3851
02:40:08,631 --> 02:40:11,180
It's a visceral fucking thing.
It makes me crazy.

3852
02:40:11,181 --> 02:40:14,730
I remember there was a porn star from 
eighties or the eighties and nineties to

3853
02:40:14,731 --> 02:40:15,520
del Rio.
No,

3854
02:40:15,530 --> 02:40:15,840
no,
no,

3855
02:40:15,841 --> 02:40:16,160
no,
no,

3856
02:40:16,170 --> 02:40:17,010
no.
Caitlin.

3857
02:40:17,040 --> 02:40:18,630
Ashley,
I think her name was.

3858
02:40:18,840 --> 02:40:20,670
Anyway,
I forget her last name,

3859
02:40:20,671 --> 02:40:22,800
but she had the biggest pussy.

3860
02:40:22,800 --> 02:40:24,540
Lips.
They were ridiculous.

3861
02:40:24,750 --> 02:40:29,750
They were like hands like,
and they would grab a hold of Dude's 

3862
02:40:29,881 --> 02:40:34,881
Dick Blick.
Look at the size of her fucking pussy 

3863
02:40:34,881 --> 02:40:35,300
lips and then I had heard from some 
something,

3864
02:40:35,301 --> 02:40:40,301
some online,
maybe it was a stern show that some 

3865
02:40:40,301 --> 02:40:41,910
women get their lobbyists.
Labor reduction.

3866
02:40:41,911 --> 02:40:44,700
I think that was doctor should be 
targeted like fucking abortion doctors.

3867
02:40:44,701 --> 02:40:47,550
I hate those guys.
That was kind of uplifting women.

3868
02:40:47,820 --> 02:40:50,520
Those poor women that think that there's
anything wrong with that.

3869
02:40:50,610 --> 02:40:51,990
Like that.
It feels good,

3870
02:40:51,991 --> 02:40:54,330
all that,
all that is just more pussy.

3871
02:40:54,331 --> 02:40:59,331
It's more lips.
They don't get it wrong with it and I 

3872
02:40:59,331 --> 02:41:00,090
try and I say that it's really,
but women do appreciate that.

3873
02:41:00,091 --> 02:41:02,970
Like the fact that I take that stand and
I'm really dirty about it,

3874
02:41:02,971 --> 02:41:05,910
but it's like they really do appreciate 
the fact that your body.

3875
02:41:05,911 --> 02:41:06,960
I love it.

3876
02:41:07,340 --> 02:41:11,100
It's like you've got big areolas man.
Fucking giant.

3877
02:41:11,101 --> 02:41:13,030
Every Ola.
Nothing wrong with that.

3878
02:41:13,110 --> 02:41:16,020
Takes the whole boob.
He just Ariel and I like big kids too.

3879
02:41:16,021 --> 02:41:17,710
But you know what?
If you got a cups or Beacopp,

3880
02:41:17,730 --> 02:41:20,220
she fucking titchy me.
Big Long nipples.

3881
02:41:21,150 --> 02:41:21,930
Nipples.
Like we're like,

3882
02:41:21,931 --> 02:41:22,680
oh,
I know.

3883
02:41:22,681 --> 02:41:25,680
Not like I like a fucking pussy that had
to be put in a locker,

3884
02:41:25,830 --> 02:41:30,830
like someone would change with the 
crotch and the locker because they're 

3885
02:41:30,830 --> 02:41:30,830
embarrassed or the size of the pussy 
locking that.

3886
02:41:30,830 --> 02:41:31,350
I like,
man.

3887
02:41:31,500 --> 02:41:36,500
I worked with this chick once and she 
was a very funny and very open and she 

3888
02:41:37,311 --> 02:41:42,311
was talking about her ex boyfriend that 
her ex boyfriend had before you had met 

3889
02:41:42,311 --> 02:41:46,431
her,
had hooked up with this woman they were 

3890
02:41:46,431 --> 02:41:48,861
making out.
They were getting all hot and heavy and 

3891
02:41:48,861 --> 02:41:49,560
then when he pulled her pants down,
her clit was like really long,

3892
02:41:49,920 --> 02:41:52,470
like absurdly long,
like a small thumb.

3893
02:41:52,590 --> 02:41:57,590
It was just like any panicked and she 
responded like she knew that,

3894
02:41:58,090 --> 02:42:00,060
you know,
other guys had probably already panicked

3895
02:42:00,660 --> 02:42:04,530
and he made up some story about needing 
to go to the airport for getting to pick

3896
02:42:04,531 --> 02:42:06,840
up his brother.
Hey ran out of her.

3897
02:42:07,890 --> 02:42:08,970
He saw her,
her,

3898
02:42:09,090 --> 02:42:11,870
her,
her Dick Pussy and just ran out.

3899
02:42:11,900 --> 02:42:16,900
I told you on an earlier podcast where I
was so drunk once that I was eating a 

3900
02:42:16,900 --> 02:42:20,841
girl out and suck her lips.
It would go out so far that I kind of 

3901
02:42:20,841 --> 02:42:25,551
thought maybe she,
it was a like a bad penis or something 

3902
02:42:25,551 --> 02:42:25,551
like,
like yeah,

3903
02:42:25,551 --> 02:42:29,990
like it was under foreign penis or 
something and so I had to like turn on 

3904
02:42:29,990 --> 02:42:30,210
the light a little and look at it 
because it was so.

3905
02:42:30,230 --> 02:42:35,230
I mean it was that long coke zero.
It's stretched out like fucking came in 

3906
02:42:35,821 --> 02:42:36,480
my mouth.

3907
02:42:41,310 --> 02:42:43,710
I would fucking love that.
Like I would never be mad.

3908
02:42:43,890 --> 02:42:46,950
I had a woman walk up and go like,
I have what you like,

3909
02:42:47,520 --> 02:42:51,680
so happy and her pussy.
Then it was just,

3910
02:42:51,720 --> 02:42:56,100
it was a fucking giant pack.
It looks like an octopus.

3911
02:42:56,160 --> 02:42:56,710
Yeah,
Dude.

3912
02:42:56,720 --> 02:43:01,720
It was like indefinable,
like you wouldn't know what it was if 

3913
02:43:01,720 --> 02:43:01,830
somebody just showed you a picture of it
without a woman attack.

3914
02:43:02,530 --> 02:43:07,530
Fuck is that.
You'd have no idea if they get a bunch 

3915
02:43:07,530 --> 02:43:08,090
of things thrown somewhere.
How bad was it?

3916
02:43:08,091 --> 02:43:09,570
The worst one you've ever seen or the 
wonderful?

3917
02:43:09,571 --> 02:43:11,890
The best one you've ever seen?
The best one I've seen in one of them.

3918
02:43:11,891 --> 02:43:16,891
One one was a dominatrix.
I only saw a couple of times many years 

3919
02:43:16,891 --> 02:43:19,900
ago and one was a massage therapist who 
was massaging me,

3920
02:43:19,901 --> 02:43:24,901
probably 2002 and I was on my back and 
she had shorts and I had convinced her 

3921
02:43:24,901 --> 02:43:26,020
to go over my face so I could look at 
her ass.

3922
02:43:26,350 --> 02:43:30,280
I didn't know her pussy and she,
her legs parted and I saw her pussy.

3923
02:43:30,610 --> 02:43:34,510
It was literally a fucking belly button 
to the spine.

3924
02:43:34,900 --> 02:43:38,200
It was the holy grail.
I lost my breath.

3925
02:43:38,710 --> 02:43:41,730
I lost my belly button.
You probably choking on it,

3926
02:43:41,740 --> 02:43:42,460
dude.
I fucked.

3927
02:43:42,461 --> 02:43:43,480
No,
she wouldn't let me do anything.

3928
02:43:43,840 --> 02:43:45,760
Eventually she let me lick it and smell 
it.

3929
02:43:45,761 --> 02:43:46,970
It was like,
it would always snap,

3930
02:43:47,440 --> 02:43:49,390
dude.
It was fucking awesome.

3931
02:43:51,220 --> 02:43:53,000
We would always fight money when she 
would come over,

3932
02:43:53,001 --> 02:43:58,001
but she got too greedy.
It's like if she had just thank God she 

3933
02:43:58,001 --> 02:43:58,450
didn't know she could have owned the 
whole franchise.

3934
02:43:58,600 --> 02:43:59,400
I would.
Would've signed that.

3935
02:43:59,410 --> 02:44:00,400
Well,
this is before I owned my place,

3936
02:44:00,401 --> 02:44:02,470
but I would have given her my rent 
money.

3937
02:44:02,471 --> 02:44:04,740
Like literally she could have owned me,
still new,

3938
02:44:05,170 --> 02:44:10,170
but she will always get mad and want 
more money and the greed would turn me 

3939
02:44:10,170 --> 02:44:10,170
off because it was unreasonable.

3940
02:44:10,170 --> 02:44:13,160
I felt it was unreasonable,
but her fucking pussy man,

3941
02:44:13,790 --> 02:44:16,380
she could only with it.
So the closest you got to eat.

3942
02:44:16,381 --> 02:44:17,680
She likes to lick it.
Oh No.

3943
02:44:17,681 --> 02:44:19,930
I fucked her a couple times.
I saw him for a couple of years.

3944
02:44:20,110 --> 02:44:21,070
Oh.
But it was,

3945
02:44:21,071 --> 02:44:22,420
I think around the time that we were 
doing tough crowd.

3946
02:44:22,421 --> 02:44:24,240
He worked at slowly into fucker.
Yeah.

3947
02:44:24,390 --> 02:44:25,630
Oh,
she saw you on tough crowd.

3948
02:44:25,631 --> 02:44:26,310
One more money.
Well,

3949
02:44:26,320 --> 02:44:26,620
yeah,
yeah,

3950
02:44:26,621 --> 02:44:27,460
yeah.
Pretty much.

3951
02:44:27,461 --> 02:44:28,180
You don't know what to do.
She,

3952
02:44:28,200 --> 02:44:33,200
she had gone with a friend,
a tough crowd or something or I forget 

3953
02:44:33,200 --> 02:44:33,640
she saw it.
I forget how we get it.

3954
02:44:33,641 --> 02:44:35,530
You want to email me randomly?
I just don't remember.

3955
02:44:35,560 --> 02:44:36,800
I found online,
it depends,

3956
02:44:36,810 --> 02:44:38,890
like fucking 10 years,
but got her pussy.

3957
02:44:38,891 --> 02:44:41,950
I can remember like it was yesterday was
wonderful.

3958
02:44:42,340 --> 02:44:43,960
Jim Norton,
you're an awesome human being.

3959
02:44:44,530 --> 02:44:45,490
Thank you for being you.

3960
02:44:45,610 --> 02:44:47,370
I love you man.
And a youtube man.

3961
02:44:47,390 --> 02:44:49,120
Can I just plug my special?
Absolutely.

3962
02:44:49,121 --> 02:44:53,140
It's on this Saturday.
A June 30th epics and epics hd.com.

3963
02:44:53,620 --> 02:44:56,410
It's called please be offended and uh,
I'm very happy with it.

3964
02:44:56,411 --> 02:44:58,050
So I hope people dig it.
And uh,

3965
02:44:58,090 --> 02:44:59,390
when did you record this?
Uh,

3966
02:44:59,391 --> 02:44:59,830
I,
uh,

3967
02:44:59,831 --> 02:45:04,831
end of April and Cleveland.
So there's a lot of sand dusky stuff in 

3968
02:45:04,831 --> 02:45:04,831
it,
which actually still feels timely.

3969
02:45:04,831 --> 02:45:05,360
Thank God that's still fucking timely.
Yeah,

3970
02:45:05,361 --> 02:45:06,700
it's perfect.
It's perfect.

3971
02:45:06,701 --> 02:45:07,920
It's going on right now.
Yeah,

3972
02:45:07,960 --> 02:45:08,370
it is.
Uh,

3973
02:45:08,371 --> 02:45:09,230
it's just,
it's not a,

3974
02:45:09,231 --> 02:45:11,200
he's not even sentenced yet,
so it's still a,

3975
02:45:11,350 --> 02:45:12,460
you know,
we'll still feel fresh.

3976
02:45:12,490 --> 02:45:13,360
Yeah,
isn't that funny?

3977
02:45:13,361 --> 02:45:18,361
I did mine in late April to and it's 
just a mad scramble now to make up the 

3978
02:45:19,330 --> 02:45:20,260
next hour.
It's exciting though,

3979
02:45:20,261 --> 02:45:21,250
isn't it?
I love it,

3980
02:45:21,251 --> 02:45:23,140
dude.
I love it because I can go on,

3981
02:45:23,141 --> 02:45:26,230
like I said at the seller and I'm 
talking about the Travolta stuff and all

3982
02:45:26,231 --> 02:45:31,231
and again,
then you find this stuff that's topical 

3983
02:45:31,231 --> 02:45:31,231
where you have to weed it out because it
feels too time sensitive.

3984
02:45:31,540 --> 02:45:33,350
Like if I talked about,
I talked about tiger,

3985
02:45:33,380 --> 02:45:38,380
my special a little bit,
but the two points I hit on were so 

3986
02:45:38,380 --> 02:45:38,470
general that had.
You didn't have to remember the case,

3987
02:45:38,650 --> 02:45:41,110
but there are the 12 minutes before had 
to be cut,

3988
02:45:41,320 --> 02:45:43,270
so now I'm in that process with the 
Travolta Shit,

3989
02:45:43,271 --> 02:45:48,271
like it's already out of the news so I 
got to take a couple of moments that 

3990
02:45:48,271 --> 02:45:49,240
will feel good in six months and just 
make them part of the act.

3991
02:45:49,241 --> 02:45:50,590
But you're right.
It's fucking great.

3992
02:45:50,591 --> 02:45:55,591
I love it.
I can't wait to hear the two volts was 

3993
02:45:55,591 --> 02:45:55,591
stuff.
Yeah,

3994
02:45:55,591 --> 02:45:55,591
it's pretty good.
I'm happy with it.

3995
02:45:55,591 --> 02:45:58,030
I mean Charlie Sheen Shit.
Last time I saw you in August,

3996
02:45:58,430 --> 02:45:59,530
I stopped doing.
Thank you man.

3997
02:45:59,590 --> 02:46:01,750
I totally took that because wasn't fresh
anymore.

3998
02:46:01,760 --> 02:46:03,580
Yeah.
Got beaten down.

3999
02:46:03,590 --> 02:46:04,210
Right.
Is this.

4000
02:46:04,270 --> 02:46:07,090
Is this your trailer here?
African American woman.

4001
02:46:07,540 --> 02:46:08,620
Nevermind.
Oh No.

4002
02:46:08,621 --> 02:46:10,630
That one might've been the way we showed
one of those online.

4003
02:46:10,710 --> 02:46:15,710
What?
What number was that when you just 

4004
02:46:15,710 --> 02:46:15,710
posted today,
I believe.

4005
02:46:15,710 --> 02:46:15,710
Oh No.
Show show number.

4006
02:46:15,710 --> 02:46:17,430
I'll show you the one they showed on 
Leno show number five.

4007
02:46:18,250 --> 02:46:20,260
PSA number five.
The psis.

4008
02:46:20,630 --> 02:46:21,680
Yeah,
but they showed them on.

4009
02:46:21,890 --> 02:46:23,750
They show this one on the tonight show.
They just get a bit.

4010
02:46:23,780 --> 02:46:28,780
They left the language in and everything
because none of the clips I wanted to 

4011
02:46:28,780 --> 02:46:28,780
show,
I just.

4012
02:46:28,780 --> 02:46:30,260
I'm too embarrassed to watch myself.
But PSA.

4013
02:46:30,261 --> 02:46:31,970
The fifth one,
it's very awkward.

4014
02:46:32,210 --> 02:46:35,390
Christian and I was offended by Jim 
Norton.

4015
02:46:36,230 --> 02:46:39,380
I'm gay and I was offended by Jim 
Norton.

4016
02:46:39,830 --> 02:46:44,650
I'm black and I was deeply offended by 
Jim Norton that lily white mothers.

4017
02:46:45,110 --> 02:46:49,340
Approximately one out of every 10 
Americans is offended by Jim Norton.

4018
02:46:49,820 --> 02:46:54,820
I'm a Latina and I was offended.
Budget except for the shit he said about

4019
02:46:54,861 --> 02:46:55,840
black people.
Yo.

4020
02:46:56,340 --> 02:47:01,340
They all got big Dicks,
they showed it unkindly against Jim 

4021
02:47:04,940 --> 02:47:09,020
Norton and we strongly urge you to 
boycott Jim Norton's brand new comedy.

4022
02:47:09,021 --> 02:47:12,950
Special needs be offended only on an 
index.

4023
02:47:14,660 --> 02:47:15,770
And I approved this message.

4024
02:47:17,690 --> 02:47:19,650
Fuck,
that's right.

4025
02:47:19,660 --> 02:47:20,230
They cut the end.

4026
02:47:30,330 --> 02:47:35,330
What's worse than your manager?
Yelling something out on the back of 

4027
02:47:35,330 --> 02:47:35,330
their bombs when they show it,
but yeah,

4028
02:47:35,330 --> 02:47:36,820
they showed.
They showed a unedited.

4029
02:47:36,821 --> 02:47:38,910
So we'll see what actually gets through.
So on Epix,

4030
02:47:39,220 --> 02:47:41,410
how do they show it on Epix?
Is it sensored at all?

4031
02:47:41,530 --> 02:47:43,360
Well,
they are on the network nor the language

4032
02:47:43,361 --> 02:47:44,710
from my.
The specials.

4033
02:47:44,970 --> 02:47:49,970
These,
they edit on the networks that can show 

4034
02:47:49,970 --> 02:47:49,970
them in regular time online there 
unedited.

4035
02:47:49,970 --> 02:47:51,850
And you know my specialist.
Totally.

4036
02:47:51,851 --> 02:47:53,320
I know that they were amazing.
Your work,

4037
02:47:54,280 --> 02:47:57,280
you're allowed.
You can swear as much as God beautiful.

4038
02:47:57,310 --> 02:48:01,180
The opening,
the opening was really fucking cool.

4039
02:48:02,500 --> 02:48:07,500
We Got Ozzie to do part of the opening.
Did you fucking see the monstrous Ozzy 

4040
02:48:10,630 --> 02:48:10,900
Fan?
Yes.

4041
02:48:10,901 --> 02:48:15,901
So we got to fucking.
You could show her something like 30 

4042
02:48:15,901 --> 02:48:15,901
seconds if you want to end on that,
if that's cool,

4043
02:48:15,901 --> 02:48:16,480
but don't show the whole opening.

4044
02:48:16,480 --> 02:48:21,480
I don't think that's an online yet,
but just the ozzy ozzy twitter did for 

4045
02:48:21,480 --> 02:48:21,480
me.
They freely come in shambles.

4046
02:48:21,480 --> 02:48:21,480
Twitter to.
Yeah.

4047
02:48:21,480 --> 02:48:25,740
Wow Dude.
What is it like to grow up loving Ozzy 

4048
02:48:25,740 --> 02:48:26,350
and then being in a position where you 
get to meet the guy.

4049
02:48:26,380 --> 02:48:29,080
My fucking ex girlfriend said,
your life is fucking great.

4050
02:48:29,110 --> 02:48:32,170
You should never be angry.
Like I've met my after.

4051
02:48:32,171 --> 02:48:37,171
After I did this shoot with Ozzy,
it was in his house and it only took 20 

4052
02:48:37,171 --> 02:48:39,600
minutes and afterwards he goes,
he comes back and he's already been,

4053
02:48:39,610 --> 02:48:41,410
God bless you,
and he walks away and then he comes back

4054
02:48:41,411 --> 02:48:42,190
and he goes,
Hey Jim,

4055
02:48:42,191 --> 02:48:47,191
I want to play something for you.
And he walked me down into his fucking 

4056
02:48:47,191 --> 02:48:47,620
studio.
It's me and him alone.

4057
02:48:47,621 --> 02:48:52,621
His assistant was in the back and he 
plays me new sabbath songs sitting with 

4058
02:48:52,621 --> 02:48:52,621
fucking.

4059
02:48:52,750 --> 02:48:54,560
I almost couldn't handle it.
I almost said the.

4060
02:48:54,561 --> 02:48:57,400
Can I go home like this is more than I 
can handle.

4061
02:48:57,410 --> 02:49:02,410
It's probably the single greatest moment
ever had and he was looking over to see 

4062
02:49:02,410 --> 02:49:03,960
how I reacted to see if I was enjoying 
his musical shit.

4063
02:49:03,970 --> 02:49:06,040
I sat with Ozzy in his house and listen 
to new Sabbath.

4064
02:49:06,840 --> 02:49:09,990
It fucking amazing.
It's,

4065
02:49:10,090 --> 02:49:13,020
it's so crazy.
I just go to just go to a Ozzy Osborne's

4066
02:49:13,021 --> 02:49:18,021
twitter.
They realize you're crazy to idolize 

4067
02:49:18,021 --> 02:49:18,021
someone when you're young and just to 
even get to meet them,

4068
02:49:18,240 --> 02:49:23,240
to meet them,
but then to talk to them and to have 

4069
02:49:23,240 --> 02:49:25,080
them listen to you far to see ozzy 
performing new songs for you.

4070
02:49:25,140 --> 02:49:30,140
Yeah,
just while we sat there listening to 

4071
02:49:30,140 --> 02:49:32,061
them,
whether it was it was new songs and to 

4072
02:49:32,061 --> 02:49:32,061
know that my opinion mattered to him.
I'm like,

4073
02:49:32,061 --> 02:49:35,130
he really wanted to know what I thought 
of them and it was just some new years,

4074
02:49:35,131 --> 02:49:38,050
a few years back and last year was it 
Brian?

4075
02:49:38,540 --> 02:49:41,640
Jean Simmons came his family,
his son,

4076
02:49:42,120 --> 02:49:43,900
his son,
liked one of my cds,

4077
02:49:44,290 --> 02:49:49,290
came and brought his whole family to New
Year's at the Improv and when I got 

4078
02:49:49,561 --> 02:49:51,450
there they're like Gene Simmons and his 
family is here to see you.

4079
02:49:51,690 --> 02:49:52,710
And I was like,
what,

4080
02:49:52,920 --> 02:49:55,560
like when I was a little kid,
not only was I a huge kiss fan,

4081
02:49:55,680 --> 02:50:00,680
but I was a huge gene simmons fan.
Like he was my favorite when he had the 

4082
02:50:00,680 --> 02:50:01,100
kiss solo album and the gene simmons.
So,

4083
02:50:01,110 --> 02:50:06,110
um,
that was the one I bought when I had 

4084
02:50:06,110 --> 02:50:08,061
money.
Know the first whatever dollars I could 

4085
02:50:08,061 --> 02:50:08,061
scrounge up.
I got that one first.

4086
02:50:08,061 --> 02:50:09,270
Then I got the feeling.
Yeah.

4087
02:50:09,540 --> 02:50:11,220
Yeah.
It wasn't a Christine Sixteen.

4088
02:50:11,221 --> 02:50:13,770
Wasn't that on there?
That was off of a love gun.

4089
02:50:14,580 --> 02:50:18,690
Love Christine 16 was loved gun.
The one you're talking about.

4090
02:50:18,691 --> 02:50:21,810
The Solo had started off with 
radioactive and kiss Frito.

4091
02:50:21,840 --> 02:50:26,840
Here's,
here's the video back in the New York 

4092
02:50:26,840 --> 02:50:26,840
group.
Ace freely.

4093
02:50:26,840 --> 02:50:26,840
Phenomenal.
Fuck yeah.

4094
02:50:30,530 --> 02:50:32,220
Look,
I really,

4095
02:50:32,250 --> 02:50:36,840
really need you to do this.
I want to do.

4096
02:50:40,340 --> 02:50:43,160
I'm your biggest fan.
I never asked her for anything.

4097
02:50:43,161 --> 02:50:44,810
You'll take two seconds.

4098
02:50:44,900 --> 02:50:48,710
I'm a little fucking busy right now.
We're not in any rush.

4099
02:50:49,400 --> 02:50:52,550
We'll wait.
If I do this one thing when you might be

4100
02:50:52,551 --> 02:50:54,620
a big premise.
Sure there are.

4101
02:50:54,670 --> 02:50:58,290
You will never ever bother me again.
Me fucking alternatives.

4102
02:50:58,580 --> 02:51:01,480
Photographs to your ass.
Any fucking thing?

4103
02:51:01,620 --> 02:51:03,000
Yes.
I promise.

4104
02:51:03,001 --> 02:51:04,920
I swear.
Okay,

4105
02:51:05,750 --> 02:51:10,750
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome to the stage Mr Jim 

4106
02:51:10,750 --> 02:51:11,050
fucking.

4107
02:51:12,740 --> 02:51:13,140
Wow.

4108
02:51:14,280 --> 02:51:16,920
That gives me chills.
Is that great though?

4109
02:51:17,010 --> 02:51:19,290
Just looking the fact that that happened
for you.

4110
02:51:19,291 --> 02:51:22,080
That gives me chills and I got to walk 
out,

4111
02:51:22,100 --> 02:51:24,330
but that was the reason you hear 
laughter because that was shown on a big

4112
02:51:24,331 --> 02:51:29,331
screen in front of the audience and I 
came out the fucking hole in the sky by 

4113
02:51:29,331 --> 02:51:32,280
Sabbath him on his toilet introducing 
me.

4114
02:51:32,640 --> 02:51:34,520
I sent Sharon the fucking email and 
does.

4115
02:51:34,560 --> 02:51:35,010
She's like,
yeah,

4116
02:51:35,011 --> 02:51:36,420
sure.
When he's back from him and we'll do it.

4117
02:51:36,600 --> 02:51:38,040
Holy Shit.
That's awesome.

4118
02:51:38,120 --> 02:51:40,350
So that's a.
that's a a life moment.

4119
02:51:40,380 --> 02:51:45,380
It really is.
It's one of the greatest moment of my 

4120
02:51:45,380 --> 02:51:45,380
life.
Fuck Rachel.

4121
02:51:45,380 --> 02:51:45,380
Thank you.
It's amazing.

4122
02:51:45,380 --> 02:51:46,440
Thank you very much for being here.
Thank you.

4123
02:51:46,470 --> 02:51:48,570
Awesome man.
Anytime you're in La,

4124
02:51:48,571 --> 02:51:52,230
please come by any time.
And your book is also hilarious.

4125
02:51:53,340 --> 02:51:56,730
Chapter with Patrice,
getting hookers in Brazil.

4126
02:51:57,080 --> 02:51:58,990
That happy endings.
Happy endings.

4127
02:51:58,991 --> 02:52:01,230
Steve Martin actually called me out on 
bashing him and fucking.

4128
02:52:01,530 --> 02:52:02,720
Are you seeing mostly?
Yeah,

4129
02:52:02,730 --> 02:52:06,130
I was doing a tonight show a bit for the
and Steve Martin

4130
02:52:06,130 --> 02:52:08,110
and his band came up and I'm like I said
to my project,

4131
02:52:08,140 --> 02:52:13,140
I don't know if he'll talk to me,
but he didn't recognize my face when he 

4132
02:52:13,140 --> 02:52:16,021
saw my name on the CD goes.
You said some very unkind things about 

4133
02:52:16,021 --> 02:52:17,080
me in your book and I actually felt 
really bad.

4134
02:52:17,130 --> 02:52:19,090
What did he say?
What'd you say about I just trashed them

4135
02:52:19,091 --> 02:52:22,300
for doing the Pink Panther,
but the book was about targeting fucking

4136
02:52:22,420 --> 02:52:27,420
Sharpton and Jesse Jackson and Keith 
Olbermann who I thought turned on Ims 

4137
02:52:27,420 --> 02:52:27,420
for language.
It was about that shit.

4138
02:52:27,420 --> 02:52:29,890
So I had missed misguided anger towards 
Steve Martin.

4139
02:52:30,040 --> 02:52:31,990
I should have made fun of them and it 
shouldn't have been as mean.

4140
02:52:31,991 --> 02:52:34,360
And I actually did feel bad about it.
It's hard.

4141
02:52:34,450 --> 02:52:38,050
It's hard when you've got to face.
I'm sorry.

4142
02:52:38,051 --> 02:52:43,051
I felt like I had uh,
Jenny Mccarthy joke and I met her and 

4143
02:52:43,051 --> 02:52:43,051
she's so nice.

4144
02:52:43,051 --> 02:52:43,600
I stopped doing it.
Yeah,

4145
02:52:43,601 --> 02:52:45,710
it's easy to track people to meet them 
and they're nice thing,

4146
02:52:45,711 --> 02:52:48,070
like a Douche bag.
I'm like,

4147
02:52:48,071 --> 02:52:49,510
why am I making fun of her?
Yeah.

4148
02:52:50,080 --> 02:52:51,670

Bitches to Norton.
One of the best comics in the country.

4160
02:53:17,920 --> 02:53:22,920
Last time I saw you in Austin,
it was a fucking a beautiful treat for 

4161
02:53:22,920 --> 02:53:24,730
me to the town and not have to work and 
a laugh my fucking ass off.

4162
02:53:24,790 --> 02:53:29,790
And I,
I changed a little bit about my act 

4163
02:53:29,790 --> 02:53:29,790
because of seeing that because you did 
about 55 minutes and I'm like,

4164
02:53:29,790 --> 02:53:31,250
why am I doing these asshole to our 
sets?

4165
02:53:32,320 --> 02:53:35,080
You crushed for 55 minutes is the 
perfect amount of time.

4166
02:53:35,150 --> 02:53:36,650
Know it was really fun,
man.

4167
02:53:36,690 --> 02:53:37,630
Thank you man.
Uh,

4168
02:53:37,631 --> 02:53:38,110
so,
uh,

4169
02:53:38,210 --> 02:53:40,450
that's it for this show.
You crazy bitches.

4170
02:53:40,451 --> 02:53:45,451
Thanks to Sucker Punch entertainment for
hookups up on the sweet deal for these 

4171
02:53:45,451 --> 02:53:49,770
monster alien ware computers,
which we're going to keep supporting 

4172
02:53:49,770 --> 02:53:50,320
alienware because they support mma 
fighters.

4173
02:53:50,380 --> 02:53:52,630
And um,
I think that's very important.

4174
02:53:52,810 --> 02:53:54,930
So that's why the show is run by 
alienware.

4175
02:53:55,090 --> 02:53:56,770
Uh,
thanks to the fleshlight.

2012,
I don't know if you might even be going 

4191
02:54:32,231 --> 02:54:32,231
to try to do that.
Tickets are on sale at death squad.

4192
02:54:32,231 --> 02:54:33,890
That TV.
And we have to ask about Joe Friday.

4193
02:54:33,891 --> 02:54:35,320
It's almost sold out though.
Yeah,

4194
02:54:35,390 --> 02:54:37,220
that's right.
Bitches this Friday.

4195
02:54:37,221 --> 02:54:39,140
We don't even know who's there on the 
show.

4196
02:54:39,170 --> 02:54:42,040
Randy Wallace is returning Brendan and 
lick.

4197
02:54:42,070 --> 02:54:44,700
He wants to talk to you.
Yes.

4198
02:54:45,060 --> 02:54:45,850
Uh,
so.

4199
02:54:45,860 --> 02:54:48,830
And Davey Johnson so far.
Tell Randy I just got my black belt.

4200
02:54:48,831 --> 02:54:51,800
I'm not fucking around.
I'm not fucking around.

4201
02:54:51,801 --> 02:54:52,960
You want to get crazy,
randy?

4202
02:54:53,210 --> 02:54:55,250
You son of a bitch.
Um,

4203
02:54:57,680 --> 02:54:59,540
people don't even know what the fuck 
we're talking.

4204
02:54:59,541 --> 02:55:01,580
We'd watch Friday.
You'll figure it out.

4205
02:55:01,610 --> 02:55:03,440
Maybe not.
We don't know what's going to happen.

4206
02:55:03,980 --> 02:55:08,980
Actually a pulled muscle.
I probably shouldn't even do what I 

4207
02:55:08,980 --> 02:55:08,980
wanted to do.
Um,

4208
02:55:08,980 --> 02:55:08,980
but uh,
anyway,

4209
02:55:08,980 --> 02:55:09,590
that's uh,
that's the end of the show.

4210
02:55:09,591 --> 02:55:11,490
You fucking freaks.
If you want to go to this ice.

Our show go to [inaudible] house 
comedy.com.

4212
02:55:13,640 --> 02:55:18,020

It's only a 150 seat place,

4213
02:55:18,021 --> 02:55:23,021
but it's awesome.
It's one of the best clubs in the 

4214
02:55:23,021 --> 02:55:23,021
country.
You ever worked the Ice House?

4215
02:55:23,021 --> 02:55:23,060
Jim Norton?
I have not.

4216
02:55:23,061 --> 02:55:27,020
I did a Sunday night there and I just 
did a quick set and what's his name?

4217
02:55:27,021 --> 02:55:30,050
Bumped me.
I'm one of the fucking blue collar guys.

4218
02:55:31,870 --> 02:55:32,390
Me?
Yeah,

4219
02:55:32,670 --> 02:55:33,720
but he was.
He was pleasant about it.

4220
02:55:33,740 --> 02:55:34,480
Oh,

4221
02:55:34,760 --> 02:55:36,140

4222
02:55:36,141 --> 02:55:36,890
Comedy Magic.
No,

4223
02:55:36,891 --> 02:55:38,000
this is the ice.
I've never worried.

4224
02:55:38,030 --> 02:55:38,720
Oh No.
There was one.

4225
02:55:38,721 --> 02:55:43,721
I had an argument with the lady here 
because they wouldn't put out the open 

4226
02:55:43,721 --> 02:55:43,721
mic next door.

4227
02:55:43,721 --> 02:55:43,721

4231
02:55:49,250 --> 02:55:52,570
It's just like all those other small.
It's been here for 15 years.
