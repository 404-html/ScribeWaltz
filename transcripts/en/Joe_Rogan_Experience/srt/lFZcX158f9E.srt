1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,660
The joe rogan experience and I
realized why I'm so fucked up.

2
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:05,853
It's wrestling.

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:07,540
That's what fucked up your head.

4
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:08,141
Oh,

5
00:00:08,141 --> 00:00:09,040
it just made me crazy.

6
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:10,420
Sitting some hot ass room,

7
00:00:10,421 --> 00:00:11,890
fucking getting tortured
and getting beat up.

8
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:12,370
My,

9
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:15,790
my coach is a world champion at
17 from Iran and then he left.

10
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:19,270
He left the country and then
couldn't wrestle in the Olympics,

11
00:00:19,271 --> 00:00:21,370
which she probably would have won
because he didn't have his green card,

12
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:25,960
so he would bring in all these super bad
asses to just kick the shit out of me.

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,040
My whole high school career,

14
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:28,480
they have a deep,

15
00:00:28,481 --> 00:00:29,800
deep background in wrestling.

16
00:00:29,801 --> 00:00:30,310
Man,

17
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:31,350
they fucking tortured me,

18
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:31,801
Ron.

19
00:00:31,801 --> 00:00:32,560
It's just,

20
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:33,730
I remember the iron sheik.

21
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:34,623
Yes,

22
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:38,860
she legit wrestling.

23
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:41,110
She was the legit wrestling.

24
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:44,740
I had them in a car.

25
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:46,920
I'm not kidding you man.

26
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:48,010
He was a world class

27
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,090
for like an hour.

28
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:54,040
He's a good dude,

29
00:00:54,041 --> 00:00:54,430
man.

30
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:54,640
Is.

31
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,530
He came on stage with me in Toronto.

32
00:00:56,531 --> 00:00:56,981
I did this.

33
00:00:56,981 --> 00:00:57,910
We'd store this.

34
00:00:57,911 --> 00:00:59,020
We'd show in Toronto.

35
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:00,010
They do the show.

36
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:01,870
It's like the underground comedy show.

37
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:06,640
They do it in a weed store and the weed
store is up like a bong shop in the

38
00:01:06,641 --> 00:01:08,200
front and a comedy club in the bag.

39
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:12,160
And you go into the back and you
can't see 10 feet in front of you.

40
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:13,630
You are in the clouds.

41
00:01:13,631 --> 00:01:13,931
Man.

42
00:01:13,931 --> 00:01:14,681
I'm not joking.

43
00:01:14,681 --> 00:01:15,760
It's ridiculous.

44
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,440
It's the worst hotbox ever.

45
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:19,600
No ventilation whatsoever.

46
00:01:19,601 --> 00:01:20,411
Every now and then again,

47
00:01:20,411 --> 00:01:22,420
they opened up the back
door so nobody dies.

48
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:23,320
That's it.

49
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,510
There's no air Arab shoes.

50
00:01:24,511 --> 00:01:25,344
All you're breathing,

51
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:26,973
you're breathing in,

52
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:27,940
breathing out weed.

53
00:01:27,941 --> 00:01:28,151
It's,

54
00:01:28,151 --> 00:01:30,490
the whole room was filled with wheat
and the iron sheik was in there getting

55
00:01:30,491 --> 00:01:31,360
high as fuck.

56
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:34,080
And he came on stage while I was up there.

57
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:35,790
He came in and fucking this,

58
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,360
this is all your video of it online.

59
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:38,681
It's hilarious.

60
00:01:38,681 --> 00:01:38,751
Uh,

61
00:01:38,751 --> 00:01:40,090
me and him just talking to them

62
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:40,923
stage.

63
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:43,593
But yeah,

64
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:44,523
Iranians.

65
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,730
So imagine me at 15,

66
00:01:45,731 --> 00:01:46,870
16 cut weight.

67
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:47,860
You're fucking Sana.

68
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:51,310
And I have some 40 year old
Iranian dude massaging me,

69
00:01:51,311 --> 00:01:53,180
read my backend and credit
card down all my sweat.

70
00:01:53,181 --> 00:01:53,861
And people look at us like,

71
00:01:53,861 --> 00:01:54,730
what the fuck?

72
00:01:54,731 --> 00:01:56,020
Why is that man?

73
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:01,450
Hey Sir,

74
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:02,900
you can't buy him that way.

75
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,630
He'd be muttering to meet the Farsi.

76
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,250
You can't just scan him,

77
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,093
sir.

78
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:10,610
Do you want to fuck him?

79
00:02:10,611 --> 00:02:11,870
You're going to have to hold him down.

80
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:13,650
Oh boy.

81
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:18,290
I realized the same 24 hour fitness we
always went to in Aliso Viejo was a gay

82
00:02:18,291 --> 00:02:19,810
hangout hollow.

83
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:20,970
This is getting married.

84
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:26,000
Betty and I worked out at 24 hour fitness
and there was this dude who was the

85
00:02:26,001 --> 00:02:26,491
manager there.

86
00:02:26,491 --> 00:02:27,171
It was a cool guy.

87
00:02:27,171 --> 00:02:28,830
We just talked to him and uh,

88
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:31,820
they had sent him over from
the Santa Monica Place.

89
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:34,370
He was like a real personable,

90
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:35,450
real friendly guy.

91
00:02:35,451 --> 00:02:35,931
Like he,

92
00:02:35,931 --> 00:02:36,171
you know,

93
00:02:36,171 --> 00:02:37,310
real easy to like.

94
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:38,151
And so,

95
00:02:38,151 --> 00:02:38,331
uh,

96
00:02:38,331 --> 00:02:42,050
the Santa Monica police brought him in
because they needed to get that place

97
00:02:42,051 --> 00:02:45,890
cleaned out because it had
basically become just a fuck house.

98
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,310
Close the shower,

99
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:52,750
hose them down everywhere.

100
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:54,940
It'd be common condoms.

101
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:58,610
But my buddy ended up working.

102
00:02:58,611 --> 00:02:59,261
That's how I find I,

103
00:02:59,261 --> 00:03:02,800
but it ended up working at the same place
and they used to have to trap dudes,

104
00:03:02,801 --> 00:03:04,870
gay dudes that were fucking
in the sauna and stuff

105
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:10,070
and raped [inaudible] the cops came
because it was relatively stations.

106
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:11,390
How people die,

107
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:12,224
Bro.

108
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:17,680
Don't trap me in the
[inaudible] out of here,

109
00:03:25,751 --> 00:03:26,584
man.

110
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:31,880
You know what's incredible?

111
00:03:31,881 --> 00:03:32,960
I'm looking at,

112
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:35,150
and he starts about three rows up.

113
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:38,610
Check out the people three
rows and beyond looking at fat.

114
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:39,813
Do

115
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:46,190
you guys have no fucking
idea what Atlantic city is?

116
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:51,250
I've never been hell first time ever been
white trash in from all fucking ports.

117
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:56,510
It's 15 to get on the bus
and to go to Atlantic city.

118
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:57,710
Here's the clinker,

119
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:01,910
they give you $10 in quarters
when you get to Atlantic city.

120
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:04,520
So they basically give you $10 back.

121
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:09,170
Then they give you a book of coupons
for another 50 to eat to try to keep you

122
00:04:09,171 --> 00:04:10,004
there all day.

123
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:10,911
So if you go,

124
00:04:10,911 --> 00:04:13,070
let's say at the eight
o'clock in the morning bus,

125
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:16,910
you can't leave till five
whether you're broke,

126
00:04:16,911 --> 00:04:18,590
whether you wait all your coupons,

127
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:24,280
you cannot go back on the
[inaudible] the rules,

128
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
they have a scam every fucking hour on
the hour from all points in New Jersey

129
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:33,860
and New York buses go down
to Atlantic city right now.

130
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:34,970
Half those people sitting there,

131
00:04:34,971 --> 00:04:39,290
I've already lost that money and they're
just killing time to the midnight bus

132
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:42,560
and somebody from the UFC just
happened to give him a nice tickets.

133
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,633
They're sitting there,

134
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:45,320
they don't even know what the fuck

135
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:47,920
bookmaker,

136
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:51,380
who's going to win the fucking the Yankee
game because that's how they're going

137
00:04:51,381 --> 00:04:55,670
to bounce back on Sunday and they could
go down the shore and they look at them.

138
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,890
They're mummified.

139
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,830
It looks like a fucking old
and this is silver right there.

140
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:03,660
That's Atlantic City for you.

141
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:06,270
Where's fucking Dana and this
room where they bought a gun?

142
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,300
It's good body shot.

143
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:08,300
Where's Dana White?

144
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:08,631
He ain't,

145
00:05:08,631 --> 00:05:09,920
nobody reads fine yet.

146
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:12,730
They haven't showed him the
FERTITTA brothers fuck off.

147
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:13,820
They were in that room to hide

148
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:20,720
that hide in the main,

149
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,490
like like Fox sports fights.

150
00:05:22,491 --> 00:05:23,510
It comes out for that.

151
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,620
Like towards the end,

152
00:05:24,621 --> 00:05:26,180
like when we have that
thing where we sit down,

153
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,280
we start breaking down the
fights in the main card.

154
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:29,510
That's when he comes back.

155
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:30,643
Oh Linacre.

156
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,170
Oh that you can take it though,

157
00:05:33,171 --> 00:05:33,381
man.

158
00:05:33,381 --> 00:05:35,840
He seemed to some hard
shots standing his ground,

159
00:05:35,841 --> 00:05:36,674
man.

160
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:38,620
These guys are sweating hombre.

161
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:44,290
Brennan fucking Dana White comes in like
deliver on Goodfellows shaking hands

162
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:47,030
towards the end.

163
00:05:47,031 --> 00:05:48,020
Shaking hands,

164
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:51,940
boy that people pointing at people.

165
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,513
How about that?

166
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,330
He never hit him.

167
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:57,163
He had him,

168
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:58,490
he had him flattened down.

169
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:00,770
He had his back and he's not crashing him.

170
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:02,840
He's not blasting with punches.

171
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,030
He's got him flattened down
and he's not hitting him.

172
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:06,290
That doesn't make any sense.

173
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:06,940
He's also,

174
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:07,820
he also had a full,

175
00:06:07,821 --> 00:06:09,310
he had a full head joke.

176
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:09,711
They know,

177
00:06:09,711 --> 00:06:12,680
but he's also 51 that's true.

178
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:15,000
And a fighter 51 that's true.

179
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:15,350
You'd,

180
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:16,820
you'd a hundred percent correct.

181
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,650
And I was like,

182
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,540
I watched everyone.

183
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:19,791
Right.

184
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:20,780
I'll watch all the Bella tour.

185
00:06:20,781 --> 00:06:21,680
I'll let y'all UFC.

186
00:06:21,681 --> 00:06:22,430
I'll watch everything,

187
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:24,400
so the bell tour when,

188
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:25,490
when the entrance is,

189
00:06:25,491 --> 00:06:25,791
I was like,

190
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:26,900
this is so dope.

191
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:27,070
The,

192
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:28,400
it was kind of like
the pride and all that.

193
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,780
Then I was on board.

194
00:06:29,781 --> 00:06:30,200
You have,

195
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:30,650
I was on,

196
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:31,220
you had,

197
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:32,210
he had big brown on board,

198
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:34,580
but then when Ken shamrock
walked out I was like,

199
00:06:34,581 --> 00:06:35,450
what the fuck?

200
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:36,680
The girl who was singing,

201
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:37,611
what was that about?

202
00:06:37,611 --> 00:06:38,031
I don't know.

203
00:06:38,031 --> 00:06:38,211
See,

204
00:06:38,211 --> 00:06:39,140
I'm down with that though.

205
00:06:39,141 --> 00:06:39,910
I'm down.

206
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:42,070
I love for Brian this thing for me when I,

207
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,460
he is a man.

208
00:06:43,461 --> 00:06:45,140
He's really tall and brow,

209
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,330
no matter singer,

210
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:46,900
not like that.

211
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:47,860
Tall and Brown.

212
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:52,410
He's got great hair and a part
inspired by the Great Gatsby

213
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:57,850
I'm working with big brown,

214
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,320
his big brown,

215
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:01,280
big brown.

216
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,120
You could totally get an opponent's head.

217
00:07:05,121 --> 00:07:05,481
By the way,

218
00:07:05,481 --> 00:07:07,400
when he's laughing at year end trance,

219
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:13,460
he's going to punch this guy in his
big fan of fans and take him down.

220
00:07:13,461 --> 00:07:14,710
Be careful of his game.

221
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,340
I don't want a west side story.

222
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:17,800
Brian,

223
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:22,160
how big can surveys to
tissue is second to none.

224
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:23,600
He's really handsome,

225
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,830
doesn't he can turn on a nun.

226
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:29,840
Don't ever play with me.

227
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:31,120
Even try,

228
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:35,800
it's those numbers that you get in.

229
00:07:35,801 --> 00:07:39,070
It's just those numbers in the idea of
what you're trying to do and then there's

230
00:07:39,071 --> 00:07:43,000
all the physical shit cause some people
are just born with different bones.

231
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:43,880
They just built,

232
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,000
some people are born like Haji Gracie,

233
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,680
these long ass fucking arms.

234
00:07:47,681 --> 00:07:51,160
They can just cinch Darcy's in
from anywhere long triangles.

235
00:07:51,161 --> 00:07:54,100
They can get both your fucking arms
trapped in like in a dead orchard.

236
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:58,690
He can do things with your body if you
have these long bodies that you can't do,

237
00:07:58,691 --> 00:08:02,230
but then there's these Paul Harris bodies
plus you've got this goddamn gorilla.

238
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:02,660
I'm lucky.

239
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:03,461
Strike that guy.

240
00:08:03,461 --> 00:08:04,570
I feel like I'm you.

241
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:06,363
That's what it's like.

242
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:11,700
I stand next to him like
that was a dark time.

243
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:13,230
A beautiful bond.

244
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:13,990
Yeah.

245
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:15,450
I have a beautiful expressive boys.

246
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,750
Feel like a clod.

247
00:08:16,751 --> 00:08:17,860
Always feel like an extra.

248
00:08:17,861 --> 00:08:18,780
Why Ass Law?

249
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,910
I see a big ass fucking arm over.

250
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:24,220
You're looking at that arm?

251
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:24,370
No,

252
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:25,203
seriously.

253
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,200
On Brian,

254
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:26,880
you should lift,

255
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:27,260
right?

256
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:27,540
Yeah.

257
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:27,850
Lyft.

258
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:29,650
Here's the body is a frog.

259
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:30,543
Hey Bro.

260
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:31,533
Hey Bro,

261
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:33,650
what are you talking about?

262
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,810
Show them the guys.

263
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:46,310
I'm relaxing my head right now.

264
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:47,540
I'm relaxed to shit.

265
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:48,970
See Kermit the frog.

266
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,470
My legs are way bigger than that.

267
00:08:50,471 --> 00:08:51,304
So funny

268
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,333
the frog.

269
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:01,013
What size?

270
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:03,890
They're Kermit the frog here

271
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:07,000
currently.

272
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:07,810
Frog.

273
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:08,650
That's not bad.

274
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:12,540
A bad shot too.

275
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:14,123
That was actually

276
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,720
chairman's arms.

277
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:25,140
Just like types to stream pipe cleaners.

278
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:28,170
So silly and he's funny.

279
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:33,300
He's like the perfect
reference that is like,

280
00:09:33,301 --> 00:09:36,270
seriously are you going to
make fun of a dude's arm curry?

281
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:37,173
Kermit the

282
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:42,580
frog shit of all time.

283
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,233
Currently

284
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:47,941
take offense.

285
00:09:47,941 --> 00:09:48,774
I'm pass now.

286
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:49,773
Yes.

287
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:52,343
Thank you brother.

288
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:52,930
Thank you.

289
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:53,630
Jesus Christ.

290
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:54,570
Said it was in Costa Rica.

291
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:55,070
I oh,

292
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:56,360
I used to work in a clinic down there.

293
00:09:56,361 --> 00:09:59,870
He probably has something from
there by just a self limiting virus.

294
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:00,800
Oh by the way,

295
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:01,611
gone the next day.

296
00:10:01,611 --> 00:10:03,700
I think it was food on
my tonsil on my thing.

297
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:04,790
It's embarrassing man.

298
00:10:04,791 --> 00:10:07,910
He was probably ate a chocolate donut
with like powdered sugar on or some shit.

299
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:08,721
A hypochondriac.

300
00:10:08,721 --> 00:10:09,590
How did sugar gotten?

301
00:10:09,591 --> 00:10:12,500
A little thing that I pokes.

302
00:10:12,501 --> 00:10:13,580
I fucking hate them.

303
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:14,930
Jesus Christ.

304
00:10:14,931 --> 00:10:17,990
While your sister has spots all over
fucking tongue and doesn't do shit.

305
00:10:17,991 --> 00:10:18,980
A bitch doesn't give a fuck.

306
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:22,060
She eats grass at men's.

307
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:24,750
Who's up some grass clean mouth.

308
00:10:24,751 --> 00:10:25,940
It's got green mouth syndrome,

309
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:29,570
foamy green bubbles on
the corner of her mouth.

310
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:31,460
I keep seeing you chewing that cut again.

311
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:32,750
Shut the fuck up.

312
00:10:32,751 --> 00:10:33,584
Plus he

313
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:36,320
looks at you with your mouth open.

314
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:37,310
I'll have four stomachs,

315
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:40,580
a special type of dude to
be with a girl like that.

316
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,580
I'm not one of those guys tried it.

317
00:10:43,581 --> 00:10:44,810
I am not that guy.

318
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:45,561
I've tried it too.

319
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:46,700
I like women who were women.

320
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:47,111
Me Too.

321
00:10:47,111 --> 00:10:50,120
Like women who want to argue with you
and they get fucking gangster with you.

322
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:51,380
That's not interesting to me.

323
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:52,220
That's like when I,

324
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:53,060
when I tried,

325
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:56,870
I had a little affair with a girl on the
national Canadian water polo team who

326
00:10:56,871 --> 00:10:59,960
was so hot but she was back was
thicker than mine and her hands,

327
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,910
her knuckles when we'd hold hands.

328
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:02,271
I was like,

329
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:06,110
well your hands are a little just a
smidge bigger than mine and I have a big

330
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:06,770
problem with that.

331
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:07,011
See.

332
00:11:07,011 --> 00:11:08,720
That's what I love about my girlfriend,

333
00:11:08,721 --> 00:11:08,821
you,

334
00:11:08,821 --> 00:11:09,380
Ana,

335
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:13,190
is that she doesn't start
any drama or talk shit,

336
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:14,640
but she,

337
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:15,540
she knows her the whole,

338
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:16,941
she'll finish it,

339
00:11:16,941 --> 00:11:19,070
uses it all up given chicks concussions.

340
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:21,320
She's exhausted by the
time she gets to you.

341
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:22,610
She's very,

342
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:24,040
she's very and pitches.

343
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:25,280
I want to see you guys today.

344
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:26,420
If you guys fucked,

345
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,800
you wouldn't have much say in it.

346
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:30,770
Don't you lick pussy now?

347
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:33,990
Boosie no,

348
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:34,843
come on.

349
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:36,301
Fucking tire.

350
00:11:36,301 --> 00:11:36,730
Come on down.

351
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:40,220
She wouldn't be able to handle
any time she want to go to sleep.

352
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,780
I know why they call him the Golden Pony.

353
00:11:41,781 --> 00:11:41,961
It's,

354
00:11:41,961 --> 00:11:42,211
he's,

355
00:11:42,211 --> 00:11:42,951
he's surprising.

356
00:11:42,951 --> 00:11:44,120
He has a surprising dick.

357
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:45,230
That's cool.

358
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:45,961
It is Dickie.

359
00:11:45,961 --> 00:11:46,671
So Bryce skinny,

360
00:11:46,671 --> 00:11:47,630
skinny but like me,

361
00:11:47,631 --> 00:11:48,464
but he's surprising.

362
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:49,970
It's more of the ivory pony.

363
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:52,251
I give it to her.

364
00:11:52,251 --> 00:11:53,020
Good guys.

365
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:53,381
Serious.

366
00:11:53,381 --> 00:11:53,980
She not to put

367
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:54,813
her,

368
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:56,360
put her hair up in cornrows.

369
00:11:58,990 --> 00:11:59,890
I'd give it to her.

370
00:11:59,891 --> 00:12:00,724
Good guys.

371
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:05,800
I was setting up for my

372
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:08,800
fucking give it to her man.

373
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:09,990
That's how you know a guy's mouth.

374
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:11,500
He's not laying the proper,

375
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:18,150
I was setting up for my cornrows like
you know I do it guys like looking for

376
00:12:18,581 --> 00:12:19,720
everybody to confirm.

377
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:20,651
Come on guys.

378
00:12:20,651 --> 00:12:21,484
You know

379
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,570
I would,

380
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,840
I would fuck her good fellas.

381
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:30,350
By the time I was 10 with her,

382
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,180
she needed,

383
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:32,170
we haven't talked about this fight.

384
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,480
Who the fuck would sign up for that
flight fighting Jon Jones at a PR out of

385
00:12:37,481 --> 00:12:38,120
jail or prison.

386
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:38,970
Enjoy that.

387
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:43,170
It's going to be on motherfucker will
also the amount of people that were paying

388
00:12:43,171 --> 00:12:46,560
attention to that because they felt
like Mike Tyson got railroaded.

389
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:47,693
Like that was a,

390
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:50,400
that was a questionable decision.

391
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:51,930
Like what had happened to him,

392
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:57,630
the lawyers sort of strategy for dealing
with the case was that the girl should

393
00:12:58,201 --> 00:12:59,034
have known,

394
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:02,310
she should've known creation is going
tell room that she should have known.

395
00:13:02,311 --> 00:13:06,450
But also she should have known because
of the guy that Mike is like the strategy

396
00:13:06,451 --> 00:13:09,810
was to like make it look
like he was just a bad guy.

397
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,061
Look,

398
00:13:10,061 --> 00:13:10,501
you should know.

399
00:13:10,501 --> 00:13:10,771
He's like,

400
00:13:10,771 --> 00:13:12,090
he's out there Merkin dudes,

401
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:12,651
you know,

402
00:13:12,651 --> 00:13:15,360
we'll go watch the Marvis
Fraser fight and expect to,

403
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:16,710
what do you think's going to
happen to get alone with that?

404
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:19,340
No,

405
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:23,030
he gets that big old day coming
up and that was essential

406
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:23,871
lead their strategy,

407
00:13:23,871 --> 00:13:25,630
the lawyers strategy and that shit does.

408
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:26,493
Sitting

409
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:26,820
judge,

410
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:27,180
I was like,

411
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:27,650
man,

412
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:28,740
fuck this.

413
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:31,000
But the girl

414
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:31,710
I had a,

415
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:36,710
apparently allegedly she had a false
rape accusation or ready before the

416
00:13:36,851 --> 00:13:37,260
Tyson's.

417
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:38,050
What's her thing?

418
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:39,520
So it wasn't,

419
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:40,060
you know,

420
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:40,421
it was,

421
00:13:40,421 --> 00:13:41,050
look man,

422
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:41,883
some of these people

423
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:45,140
out there in this wild world
or crazy as fuck you don't,

424
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:48,130
you never know if Joey Diaz
was Mike Tyson's lawyer will,

425
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,100
what would that sound like?

426
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:49,521
Listen,

427
00:13:49,521 --> 00:13:50,120
cock sock guy.

428
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,700
Everybody knows you're a fucking creek.

429
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,930
That banging bitches.

430
00:13:53,931 --> 00:13:56,510
You showing you a giant Dick
to the fucking general public.

431
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:59,190
You have to plead the fifth.

432
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:01,040
I'm going to fucking talk for you,

433
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:02,540
Mike.

434
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:03,740
You're the baddest of all time.

435
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:05,480
We're going to get you out of this.

436
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:10,750
Oh,

437
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:14,510
we're going to read books and hold hands.

438
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:16,090
We're gonna break out the fucking week.

439
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:17,990
You drop your grandmother

440
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:21,860
in a fucking hotel.

441
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:22,703
Rome.

442
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:25,100
You wait,

443
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:25,933
lob stuck.

444
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,490
Did you read locked up?

445
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:28,324
Well you're stuck that

446
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:35,120
guaranteed like my bike crystal.

447
00:14:35,121 --> 00:14:35,960
Cause you're my friend.

448
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,593
Come on

449
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,780
watching this fight going fucking nuts.

450
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:48,050
All I was thinking about in
the beginning was he's too big.

451
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:48,920
He's not going to win.

452
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:49,940
He's just too big.

453
00:14:49,941 --> 00:14:51,020
There's no way he can do this.

454
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,040
He's too big.

455
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:53,053
He's too big.

456
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:54,521
Ooh.

457
00:14:54,521 --> 00:14:55,350
Ones about toddler.

458
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:56,183
That's,

459
00:14:56,650 --> 00:14:57,483
Oh shit.

460
00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:00,580
That was Bob as a child.

461
00:15:00,581 --> 00:15:01,720
Too late though for this round.

462
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:04,420
But when he got Bob inside
controller's working,

463
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:07,330
trying for a Kimora on a 375 pound man.

464
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:09,220
That's hilarious dude.

465
00:15:09,221 --> 00:15:10,060
Bob Sat up,

466
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:12,670
followed him in his guard.

467
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:14,080
His neck looks fine.

468
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:15,011
No,

469
00:15:15,011 --> 00:15:16,120
it's not filed.

470
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:17,020
You shut the fuck up.

471
00:15:17,021 --> 00:15:21,790
380 pound dudes slam your weight
and his weight on your neck.

472
00:15:21,791 --> 00:15:22,624
Believe me,

473
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:23,680
you've got an interview,

474
00:15:23,681 --> 00:15:26,180
said he give the chance.

475
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:28,880
What's that bait or wouldn't find them.

476
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:30,060
I worked a little bit,

477
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:33,370
but he mostly allows you to neck
problems come from the lower body,

478
00:15:33,371 --> 00:15:34,204
your hip area.

479
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:36,563
She out there for

480
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:38,460
your,

481
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:41,010
your next hurt because
your hips are super tight.

482
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:41,420
Yeah.

483
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:44,190
You're one of those guys weird.

484
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:44,780
Oh Gosh.

485
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:46,290
I think we have some magical secret.

486
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:50,760
Kurt's because your ass is a swear to God.

487
00:15:50,761 --> 00:15:51,750
I got a massage and calls me.

488
00:15:51,751 --> 00:15:55,080
The guy wanted to put his fingers
up my hands and you let it out.

489
00:15:55,081 --> 00:15:55,914
I swear to God.

490
00:15:56,010 --> 00:15:57,870
He told me that there's
a nerve center there.

491
00:15:57,871 --> 00:15:58,441
The releases,

492
00:15:58,441 --> 00:15:58,891
all the muscles.

493
00:15:58,891 --> 00:15:59,460
I wait.

494
00:15:59,460 --> 00:15:59,821
I know.

495
00:15:59,821 --> 00:16:00,654
That's cool bro.

496
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:01,870
You what me?

497
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:03,090
I can't hurt anybody's feelings.

498
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:04,140
I was going,

499
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:04,471
I know,

500
00:16:04,471 --> 00:16:05,041
but it's cool.

501
00:16:05,041 --> 00:16:05,401
It's cool.

502
00:16:05,401 --> 00:16:06,380
But you know what I think I'm going to,

503
00:16:06,381 --> 00:16:08,500
I'm going to have to take

506
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:12,970
I'm good with it.

507
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:14,160
I just need to this part,

508
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:15,083
this part.

509
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:17,703
It's in your hips.

510
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,430
Why don't you talk about that on stage?

511
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,273
It's

512
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:24,430
a double thing is up my write up my ass.

513
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:25,933
I was like no,

514
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,180
he gave me a massage.

515
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:32,810
He was a misuse and then I sat and I was
my back really hurt in college so I had

516
00:16:33,301 --> 00:16:34,134
a bad back.

517
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:35,580
So my lower back and he goes,

518
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:36,270
he goes,

519
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:40,290
so he's massaging me and he's touching
everywhere but my feet and my is weird.

520
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:40,981
My feet,

521
00:16:40,981 --> 00:16:41,330
I mean my,

522
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:41,761
my back,

523
00:16:41,761 --> 00:16:43,440
where's he saw my feet,

524
00:16:43,441 --> 00:16:44,220
my legs.

525
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:46,620
Then he starts talking about
my ass and then he goes,

526
00:16:46,621 --> 00:16:48,090
you hold a lot of tension here.

527
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:48,781
And I'm like,

528
00:16:48,781 --> 00:16:49,231
okay,

529
00:16:49,231 --> 00:16:50,070
this feels good though.

530
00:16:50,071 --> 00:16:51,810
He's like a massaging my glutes.

531
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:52,921
And then he goes,

532
00:16:52,921 --> 00:16:53,281
he goes,

533
00:16:53,281 --> 00:16:53,971
I swear to God.

534
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:54,330
He goes,

535
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:55,680
so now this is going to be weird.

536
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:58,500
Maybe in the beginning
you have a nerve center,

537
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:01,170
you have a nerve center
right next to your prostate.

538
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:01,741
And he goes to,

539
00:17:01,741 --> 00:17:03,300
what I do is I'm going
to get right up here

540
00:17:06,210 --> 00:17:07,043
and he goes,

541
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,960
how'd to get it right up there with my
fingers and I'm in a massage the area.

542
00:17:09,961 --> 00:17:12,000
And what's gonna happen is you're
going to let go completely,

543
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,350
but you've got to really let go.

544
00:17:13,351 --> 00:17:14,071
Start letting go now.

545
00:17:14,071 --> 00:17:14,610
And I go,

546
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:15,830
I was w,

547
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:16,590
what do you mean?

548
00:17:16,590 --> 00:17:17,190
He goes,

549
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:17,730
I'm going to put it,

550
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:18,330
I'm going to put it,

551
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:19,800
I'm going to have to go in your anus.

552
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:20,540
And I'm say,

553
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:20,821
and I go,

554
00:17:20,821 --> 00:17:20,911
no,

555
00:17:20,911 --> 00:17:20,990
no,

556
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:21,061
no,

557
00:17:21,061 --> 00:17:21,450
no.

558
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:22,171
I got to know what it's okay.

559
00:17:22,171 --> 00:17:23,220
Because for me,

560
00:17:23,221 --> 00:17:23,750
I'm,

561
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:25,110
I'm more tight here.

562
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,113
Oh.

563
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:28,470
So I'm not used to that.

564
00:17:28,471 --> 00:17:30,880
So that's not something I can also,

565
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,490
I'm not used to that.

566
00:17:32,491 --> 00:17:33,210
Yup.

567
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:38,210
So then I find out they find out that
my buddy who is from Jordan and I really

568
00:17:39,631 --> 00:17:40,464
macho dude,

569
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:41,460
macho dude,

570
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:44,100
he was Jordan and from Jordan and Germany,

571
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:45,330
good looking guy,

572
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:49,110
always combed his hair with a brush and
wore tight jeans and pulled his balls

573
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:50,220
cocked to one side.

574
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:52,440
And he was very happy
with the carrot that I do.

575
00:17:52,441 --> 00:17:55,830
I take this woman to my bed I
made that was based on this guy,

576
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,240
and I don't want to say his name,

577
00:17:57,241 --> 00:17:57,531
but he,

578
00:17:57,531 --> 00:17:57,780
he,

579
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:58,320
um,

580
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,240
I found out that,

581
00:18:00,241 --> 00:18:00,630
uh,

582
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:01,650
he up fingered,

583
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:03,870
fingered and then he let the do blow him.

584
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:04,350
He's like,

585
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:05,240
oh man.

586
00:18:05,241 --> 00:18:06,330
Well we were all like this.

587
00:18:06,331 --> 00:18:06,900
We were like,

588
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:07,141
yeah,

589
00:18:07,141 --> 00:18:07,980
but he's from Jordan,

590
00:18:07,981 --> 00:18:08,221
man.

591
00:18:08,221 --> 00:18:09,420
It's probably kind of macho.

592
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:10,060
We kind of,

593
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:12,380
Yay.

594
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:13,890
Wait a minute.

595
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:14,830
Hold up path.

596
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,200
He's not from America.

597
00:18:17,201 --> 00:18:18,700
Maybe it's like a cultural thing.

598
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:19,181
Made a minute.

599
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:21,010
You lift that was talking about it again.

600
00:18:21,011 --> 00:18:23,140
He let a guy finger your
ass and then blow you.

601
00:18:23,141 --> 00:18:24,220
That is a gap.

602
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:25,083
I would imagine.

603
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:25,750
That's how,

604
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:26,530
that's what I would say.

605
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:28,710
No experiment sex.

606
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:29,980
Not to be,

607
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:32,560
but I was in college and I
saw him have sex with a girl.

608
00:18:32,561 --> 00:18:35,110
I had sex in a room where
you know you're younger,

609
00:18:35,111 --> 00:18:35,381
you're like,

610
00:18:35,381 --> 00:18:35,471
oh,

611
00:18:35,471 --> 00:18:36,580
we can't afford a hotel room.

612
00:18:36,581 --> 00:18:37,414
We got to share one.

613
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:37,660
Right.

614
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:38,321
I'm having sex.

615
00:18:38,321 --> 00:18:39,790
He's having sex with a girl,

616
00:18:39,791 --> 00:18:40,624
do it.

617
00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:42,090
He bangs girls as well.

618
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:43,580
He banged girls at guys well,

619
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:46,360
well and hard and he was working at peace.

620
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:47,980
I know dudes go both ways,

621
00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:50,890
but he left a guy blowing and I
don't give a shit what his fingers.

622
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:51,460
Right.

623
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:54,070
This is a guy who hasn't done
that other in other places.

624
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:56,740
Just did it this one time or what's that?

625
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:58,093
Look guys,

626
00:18:58,300 --> 00:18:59,133
I don't know man.

627
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:00,490
We didn't really talk about it after that.

628
00:19:00,491 --> 00:19:00,950
We were like,

629
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:01,661
that's not the first.

630
00:19:01,661 --> 00:19:02,291
That was the one that's like,

631
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:03,124
you know what man,

632
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:04,120
we'll give him a pass.

633
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:05,110
Hold down the control.

634
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:07,830
Did you find out that he got blown by the,

635
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:09,880
he the guy who did it,

636
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:11,260
told my buddy Dan,

637
00:19:11,261 --> 00:19:11,591

638
00:19:11,591 --> 00:19:12,640
very confidentially,

639
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:14,740
very confidentially because Dan,

640
00:19:14,741 --> 00:19:15,570
my buddy was Dan.

641
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:16,870
I also got fingered in the bucket.

642
00:19:16,871 --> 00:19:18,880
Dan is a little guy and he goes,

643
00:19:18,881 --> 00:19:20,930
she used to hang out with them straight.

644
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:25,600
I was fucking tricky university Dan goes,

645
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:26,880
so dang good.

646
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:27,520
So,

647
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,680
so check it out.

648
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:29,280
He goes,

649
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,200
there are a lot of people in here in your
midst that have had things with guys.

650
00:19:32,201 --> 00:19:32,590
I was like,

651
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:32,951
like,

652
00:19:32,951 --> 00:19:33,700
who?

653
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:34,061
And he goes,

654
00:19:34,061 --> 00:19:35,320
well don't tie it back.

655
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:35,861
Told you this,

656
00:19:35,861 --> 00:19:36,521
but blah blah blah.

657
00:19:36,521 --> 00:19:36,940
And I was like,

658
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:37,810
Oh man,

659
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:38,860
there it is.

660
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:40,120
But he was so macho,

661
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:42,090
but you hold on a second,

662
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:45,383
bag it up.

663
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:46,361
So,

664
00:19:46,361 --> 00:19:46,920
um,

665
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:47,920
I remember these stories.

666
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:51,840
Either you forget the stories and gay
guy who tried to finger your ass as soon

667
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:53,250
as hold this other guy.

668
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:55,990
This is where the guide or
finger his ass and blow them.

669
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:58,360
But that guy never admitted
it to anybody else.

670
00:19:58,510 --> 00:19:58,840
No.

671
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,250
So how do you know if it's even true?

672
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:00,970
The Guy,

673
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:01,810
he's a trickster.

674
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:05,290
You said the guy wasn't even the way
she did it because he only told my other

675
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:05,991
friend who was gay.

676
00:20:05,991 --> 00:20:06,750
It was gay.

677
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:10,870
Made him say not tell
anybody because he's lying.

678
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:14,770
It could easily be because he's alive
and he's got a fantasy of blowing your

679
00:20:14,771 --> 00:20:15,311
heart ass.

680
00:20:15,311 --> 00:20:20,190
Jordanian friend made the story up and
then you had bay tells you like it's look

681
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,500
guy blows everybody good.

682
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,090
Let them blow yet.

683
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:22,923
Yeah,

684
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:25,700
but it was the next thing you know
the guy who was a new assay close.

685
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,553
A big secret.

686
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:28,270
He didn't want the Gig.

687
00:20:28,271 --> 00:20:29,230
I didn't want anybody to know.

688
00:20:29,231 --> 00:20:29,681
He told,

689
00:20:29,681 --> 00:20:31,360
cause you probably thought
your friend would kill him.

690
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:32,860
The Jordanian friend.

691
00:20:32,861 --> 00:20:34,210
I mean he's a Middle Eastern guy.

692
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:36,940
It's very likely Zeus or not.

693
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:37,900
Yeah,

694
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,270
no he was soft,

695
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:40,750
weak bro.

696
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:47,110
Crew was pretty a bit about bisexuals
that I don't think they really exist.

697
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:51,250
I think there's gay dudes and then
there's really gullible straight dudes who

698
00:20:51,251 --> 00:20:53,590
get talked in to blow and crafty gay dude,

699
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,820
this guy is like making my act real.

700
00:20:57,850 --> 00:20:58,600
That's probably true.

701
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,130
That's what a bisexual is.

702
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:04,420
There's guys that just crap this fuck
my friend Jimmy used to say they're just

703
00:21:04,421 --> 00:21:04,990
greedy.

704
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:05,823
That's what he used to say.

705
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:06,250
Well,

706
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:08,110
like bisexual is their fucking greedy.

707
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:09,731
Just just one.

708
00:21:09,731 --> 00:21:10,180
Everything.

709
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:10,990
Eh,

710
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:11,381
Kimmy,

711
00:21:11,381 --> 00:21:12,214
Kimmy,

712
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:16,100
he's like PME,

713
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:17,680
Cammie picket team.

714
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:19,180
He just liked attractive people.

715
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:20,260
Well,

716
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:21,100
this guy,

717
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:21,580
um,

718
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:23,410
do you still Facebook them every night?

719
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,210
No.

720
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:28,750
How did you end the sparring
session on the massage?

721
00:21:28,751 --> 00:21:29,680
They just gave me,

722
00:21:29,681 --> 00:21:31,300
he finished it up and they said,

723
00:21:31,301 --> 00:21:32,134
well,

724
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:32,711
he goes,

725
00:21:32,711 --> 00:21:33,280
he goes back.

726
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:33,611
He goes,

727
00:21:33,611 --> 00:21:33,881
he goes,

728
00:21:33,881 --> 00:21:34,714
I messed it up.

729
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:34,871
Well,

730
00:21:34,871 --> 00:21:35,681
we dated for a while,

731
00:21:35,681 --> 00:21:36,910
but he charged them what?

732
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:37,571
He goes,

733
00:21:37,571 --> 00:21:37,961
he goes,

734
00:21:37,961 --> 00:21:41,680
it's something you have to work
up to and it's something that I,

735
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:44,210
I think I can read almost had you
for a little bit where you're like,

736
00:21:44,211 --> 00:21:44,381
yeah,

737
00:21:44,381 --> 00:21:45,280
maybe I,

738
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:45,971
I was like,

739
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:47,080
that would be weird.

740
00:21:47,081 --> 00:21:47,980
How would I do that?

741
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:48,843
Yeah.

742
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:52,091
Wait,

743
00:21:52,091 --> 00:21:53,230
I'm going to tell you something else.

744
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:55,300
I'm making this up now that I remember it.

745
00:21:55,301 --> 00:21:56,380
I blocked some of it actually

746
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,930
he did massage my tank.

747
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:01,320
[inaudible].

748
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:06,700
I swear to God he massage
that area because he told
me that area is where a lot

749
00:22:06,701 --> 00:22:07,660
of tension and I was like,

750
00:22:07,661 --> 00:22:08,620
this is awful.

751
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:10,360
I remember my toes kept pointing.

752
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:11,230
I don't know.

753
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:11,850
I was like,

754
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:12,690
Oh,

755
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:14,030
oh,

756
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:14,771
oh God.

757
00:22:14,771 --> 00:22:15,604
I didn't want to be

758
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:17,860
bad with confrontation.

759
00:22:17,861 --> 00:22:18,681
I didn't want to be in Alto,

760
00:22:18,681 --> 00:22:19,860
so I just let it happen.

761
00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:20,200
Yeah.

762
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:20,590
I was like,

763
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:21,423
I'm good man.

764
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:22,150
That's cool.

765
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:22,871
My lower back,

766
00:22:22,871 --> 00:22:25,560
I get pointed in my lower back
muscles that were over here.

767
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:30,280
Jokes come from probably
that's all I do on your tape.

768
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:33,100
You got a dude besides
your team been picked up?

769
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:36,730
I haven't had a bad back problems
since you've been picked up for cross.

770
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:38,500
He got arrested for prostitution.

771
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:39,513
When

772
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:44,230
I don't eat crackers
with the crackers down.

773
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:45,760
This is great.

774
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,940
I just felt the other day,

775
00:22:46,941 --> 00:22:48,280
but everybody thinks that it was fighting,

776
00:22:48,281 --> 00:22:48,691
so I was like,

777
00:22:48,691 --> 00:22:49,451
people like you got arrested?

778
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:49,781
Yeah,

779
00:22:49,781 --> 00:22:50,141
why?

780
00:22:50,141 --> 00:22:50,801
I was fighting.

781
00:22:50,801 --> 00:22:53,170
I have a whole story
about prostitution now.

782
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:53,800
Well,

783
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:54,521
no it wasn't,

784
00:22:54,521 --> 00:22:55,630
but that wasn't,

785
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:57,460
I was not trying to pick up prostitutes.

786
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,890
I see the story that you
tell me what he was doing.

787
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:01,570
I have paid for sex.

788
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,700
Now anyone who knows me knows
that and I believe in it.

789
00:23:03,701 --> 00:23:04,534
I just haven't done it.

790
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:06,310
Believe in it.

791
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:06,910
I think it's a really,

792
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:07,750
it does exist.

793
00:23:07,751 --> 00:23:08,800
It's not Santa Claus.

794
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:09,460
That's true.

795
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:09,821
And,

796
00:23:09,821 --> 00:23:10,900
and I don't do it.

797
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:13,840
I don't do it in my adult
years because I don't want to,

798
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:14,640
I don't,

799
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,461
it doesn't turn me on.

800
00:23:15,461 --> 00:23:17,230
And for a lot of reasons I just
don't want to be part of it.

801
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:18,063
But you're married.

802
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:18,620
Well,

803
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:18,821
yeah,

804
00:23:18,821 --> 00:23:19,631
but even if I wasn't married,

805
00:23:19,631 --> 00:23:22,060
I wouldn't do it because
I have my own responsive.

806
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:24,340
You want someone to be attracted to you?

807
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:25,630
Yes,

808
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:26,463
it is.

809
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:29,380
I don't want to contribute to
someone else's destruction.

810
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:30,191
There are a lot of reasons.

811
00:23:30,191 --> 00:23:31,150
I have a philosophy behind it.

812
00:23:31,151 --> 00:23:31,780
It doesn't matter.

813
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:32,051
But,

814
00:23:32,051 --> 00:23:32,400
but,

815
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:32,980
um,

816
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:33,970
I come out of,

817
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:34,720
uh,

818
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,620
Jimmy Burke's apartment.

819
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:37,690
It's late at night.

820
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,490
I am literally been on a plane and these,

821
00:23:40,610 --> 00:23:45,610
these two blondes were in a car and I
look in and I go and they go and I go,

822
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:46,863
hi,

823
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:48,051
what are you doing?

824
00:23:48,051 --> 00:23:49,390
I go now months and Emilia,

825
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:49,700
I'm like,

826
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:50,090
hmm,

827
00:23:50,090 --> 00:23:50,923
interesting.

828
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:51,461
And I figured,

829
00:23:51,461 --> 00:23:51,660
man,

830
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:51,980
I think,

831
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:52,350
I dunno.

832
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:53,121
They look kind of hug,

833
00:23:53,121 --> 00:23:53,511
hug her,

834
00:23:53,511 --> 00:23:53,811
and they go,

835
00:23:53,811 --> 00:23:55,070
you want to have a good time now to go?

836
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,180
How much?

837
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:57,253
And they go,

838
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:57,950
how much do you have?

839
00:23:57,950 --> 00:23:58,300
And I go,

840
00:23:58,300 --> 00:23:58,970
I dunno,

841
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:01,640
$5,000 how's that sound like?

842
00:24:01,641 --> 00:24:02,241
That's silly,

843
00:24:02,241 --> 00:24:03,074
right?

844
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,520
So they go,

845
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:05,391
sounds great.

846
00:24:05,391 --> 00:24:06,141
We'll be right here.

847
00:24:06,141 --> 00:24:06,470
I go,

848
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:07,190
okay,

849
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:10,700
I'm going to go right to the
bank machine and the other,

850
00:24:10,810 --> 00:24:11,680
of course you can.

851
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:13,970
So I go to the [inaudible] machine,

852
00:24:13,971 --> 00:24:14,241
by the way,

853
00:24:14,241 --> 00:24:15,320
to get to cash.

854
00:24:15,321 --> 00:24:17,450
I had no cash to get in a cab and go home.

855
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,433
Guess what?

856
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:20,720
I go to the bank machine
guess was waiting for me.

857
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:21,650
Bunch of cops.

858
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:22,790
Guess what those calls were?

859
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:23,570
Cops.

860
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:27,410
It was a sting operation and they
caught me and I looked the cubs and go,

861
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:28,760
you guys are really going to arrest me.

862
00:24:28,761 --> 00:24:29,151
I said,

863
00:24:29,151 --> 00:24:30,350
$5,000 guy goes,

864
00:24:30,351 --> 00:24:30,561
yeah,

865
00:24:30,561 --> 00:24:31,091
I know that.

866
00:24:31,091 --> 00:24:31,641
Here's the problem.

867
00:24:31,641 --> 00:24:32,660
You got caught up in the suite.

868
00:24:32,661 --> 00:24:35,480
We've got to take in sat next to a guy
who was dressed like a woman who was

869
00:24:35,481 --> 00:24:38,930
trying to pick up women and
he was peeling his knee.

870
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,040
He was so nervous.

871
00:24:40,041 --> 00:24:42,440
He was peeling his a nail Polish off.

872
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:43,400
I spent uh,

873
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,240
two days in jail.

874
00:24:44,241 --> 00:24:45,240
It was a lot of fun and I

875
00:24:47,330 --> 00:24:52,330
thank God there were there to protect
and serve that do a class for John's for

876
00:24:54,231 --> 00:24:54,860
um,

877
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:56,960
where I had to go to a class for a,

878
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:57,710
you know,

879
00:24:57,710 --> 00:24:58,251
whatever.

880
00:24:58,251 --> 00:24:58,520
Like,

881
00:24:58,520 --> 00:24:58,730
you know,

882
00:24:58,730 --> 00:24:59,840
for John John's,

883
00:24:59,841 --> 00:25:02,330
for people that this is also a story
you should be telling on stage.

884
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,140
Kind of funny way to,

885
00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:09,290
well just unbelievable
pick up prostitutes.

886
00:25:09,291 --> 00:25:14,291
Someone can come up to you and ask you
if you want to have a good time and then

887
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,090
when you respond to that,

888
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,940
but it's better to show.

889
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:19,641
The cops were cool.

890
00:25:19,641 --> 00:25:19,971
They were like,

891
00:25:19,971 --> 00:25:20,690
Bro,

892
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:21,890
I mean look for me.

893
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:22,970
By all means.

894
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:23,660
I get it.

895
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:26,930
The problem is you got caught up
in the sweep in and they were like,

896
00:25:26,931 --> 00:25:27,590
don't worry about it.

897
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:27,920
They're like,

898
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,480
it'd be knocked down to
a misdemeanor just to,

899
00:25:29,481 --> 00:25:30,201
it's a pain in the ass.

900
00:25:30,201 --> 00:25:30,441
I know.

901
00:25:30,441 --> 00:25:31,101
They were all cool.

902
00:25:31,101 --> 00:25:31,341
I mean,

903
00:25:31,341 --> 00:25:31,521
you know,

904
00:25:31,521 --> 00:25:31,780
but,

905
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:33,170
but you were in jail for two days.

906
00:25:33,171 --> 00:25:38,120
That's not a misdemeanor and I had to
make up a story up next to you on a call

907
00:25:38,121 --> 00:25:39,200
and say shit like that.

908
00:25:39,201 --> 00:25:40,770
You gotta know that they'll park.

909
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:41,301
They were parked.

910
00:25:41,301 --> 00:25:41,411
Yeah.

911
00:25:41,411 --> 00:25:42,051
I think music,

912
00:25:42,051 --> 00:25:42,861
video type shit.

913
00:25:42,861 --> 00:25:43,880
That shit don't exist.

914
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:44,990
It does exist though.

915
00:25:44,991 --> 00:25:49,220
That's the problem you hear about and
fucking penthouse letters and maybe this

916
00:25:49,221 --> 00:25:52,970
is the time when I was getting married
the next day or something and I wedding

917
00:25:52,971 --> 00:25:53,481
would be over.

918
00:25:53,481 --> 00:25:56,150
I mean know there's all kinds of
shit I just learned when girls go,

919
00:25:56,151 --> 00:25:56,271
Oh,

920
00:25:56,271 --> 00:25:57,104
you want to party.

921
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:00,470
They're now talking about
dancing to some tunes as well.

922
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:01,333
Do a little drugs.

923
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:04,040
Hats with rubber bands at the bottom.

924
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:04,520
Yeah,

925
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,353
they're not

926
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,570
two times in Vegas.

927
00:26:08,571 --> 00:26:08,930
I got,

928
00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:10,940
I got had with a girl,

929
00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:11,690
met her,

930
00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:12,471
she's cute,

931
00:26:12,471 --> 00:26:13,131
we're talking,

932
00:26:13,131 --> 00:26:17,780
hanging out gets get upstairs and we
started kissing and she goes and I started

933
00:26:17,781 --> 00:26:17,991
moving.

934
00:26:17,991 --> 00:26:18,291
She goes,

935
00:26:18,291 --> 00:26:18,741
oh wait,

936
00:26:18,741 --> 00:26:19,341
hold on,

937
00:26:19,341 --> 00:26:20,180
hold on.

938
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,980
You have no idea how
much fun this could be,

939
00:26:21,981 --> 00:26:23,210
but nothing's free.

940
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:23,980
I was like,

941
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:25,220
Oh God.

942
00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:26,750
Then another girl,

943
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:27,780
we were hanging dancing,

944
00:26:27,810 --> 00:26:28,311
beautiful,

945
00:26:28,311 --> 00:26:29,061
having a great time.

946
00:26:29,061 --> 00:26:29,894
Kissy Kissy,

947
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:31,190
go to my room and she goes,

948
00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:31,791
oh,

949
00:26:31,791 --> 00:26:33,050
the problem is I have to go to work.

950
00:26:33,051 --> 00:26:33,351
I go,

951
00:26:33,351 --> 00:26:33,851
oh wow.

952
00:26:33,851 --> 00:26:35,060
What do you mean what didn't work where?

953
00:26:35,061 --> 00:26:35,894
Almost like an egg.

954
00:26:36,050 --> 00:26:36,470
She goes,

955
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:36,771
well,

956
00:26:36,771 --> 00:26:38,180
it cost me $1,000 you know,

957
00:26:38,181 --> 00:26:38,651
I'll lose it.

958
00:26:38,651 --> 00:26:40,370
Thousand dollars tonight if I don't dance.

959
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:41,211
I was like,

960
00:26:41,211 --> 00:26:43,290
you want $1,000 I've
kicked her out of my room.

961
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,400
You 100%

962
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:44,870
gave her thoughts.

963
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:45,240
I didn't.

964
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:45,621
I was like,

965
00:26:45,621 --> 00:26:46,454
no,

966
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,220
I didn't.

967
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:47,760
I really didn't.

968
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,181
I'd be like,

969
00:26:48,181 --> 00:26:48,421
you know what?

970
00:26:48,421 --> 00:26:49,070
I'm just going to grow.

971
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:49,260
Well,

972
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:50,093
you take check.

973
00:26:50,330 --> 00:26:50,970
Of course.

974
00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:51,241
She's like,

975
00:26:51,241 --> 00:26:51,340
no,

976
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:52,320
actually take credit cards.

977
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:53,753
She did it.

978
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:56,100
I just didn't like the way she was
trying to pull a fast one on me.

979
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:57,810
That is hilarious.

980
00:26:58,140 --> 00:26:58,330
Yeah.

981
00:26:58,330 --> 00:26:59,400
Be careful these days,

982
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:00,630
these hoes ain't loyal.

983
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:06,470
[inaudible] John,

984
00:27:06,810 --> 00:27:09,070
you know the stories of a John.

985
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:13,350
My real problem with all of it is
when you make something illegal,

986
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:18,360
it puts all this extra energy in
something because you create consequences.

987
00:27:18,361 --> 00:27:21,420
The consequences being
you could go to jail,

988
00:27:21,421 --> 00:27:22,380
crime,

989
00:27:22,381 --> 00:27:22,771
you know,

990
00:27:22,771 --> 00:27:24,420
all sorts of issues can happen.

991
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:24,901
It's a,

992
00:27:24,901 --> 00:27:25,470
is it a,

993
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:26,430
it's a misdemeanor.

994
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,360
Solicit prostitution,

995
00:27:27,361 --> 00:27:27,700
right?

996
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:29,290
That's not a Snellen knocked down.

997
00:27:29,670 --> 00:27:32,510
Carry a gun and you could still vote,

998
00:27:32,511 --> 00:27:33,344
but either way,

999
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:35,430
the idea behind what they're taking,

1000
00:27:35,431 --> 00:27:37,620
what your freedom and
putting you in the system.

1001
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:40,830
You also probably have to register
as some sort of a sex offender

1002
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:43,493
dates you do.

1003
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:46,530
I had a bed in some states
in Calabasas for sure.

1004
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:47,731
For sure.

1005
00:27:47,731 --> 00:27:49,550
You're [inaudible] man.

1006
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:51,690
I mean it depends on what
the fuck you're doing.

1007
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:52,051
You know,

1008
00:27:52,051 --> 00:27:53,520
like what are you doing
with the prostitute?

1009
00:27:53,521 --> 00:27:54,540
When you get this figured out,

1010
00:27:54,541 --> 00:27:57,570
you're still making a fire from your
job and kind of big consequences.

1011
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:01,680
Here's the point is in countries like
Australia where they have legalized

1012
00:28:01,681 --> 00:28:02,514
prostitution,

1013
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:04,450
they're divorce rate is way lower.

1014
00:28:04,451 --> 00:28:05,170
Sure.

1015
00:28:05,170 --> 00:28:08,040
They don't have like
all this violent crime,

1016
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:10,740
prostitution need.

1017
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:11,693
First of all,

1018
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,260
with violent crime,

1019
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:14,820
they don't need John's.

1020
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:15,570
Okay.

1021
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:19,560
They work in these places where they
have security to get people tested.

1022
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:20,970
When people walk through the door,

1023
00:28:20,971 --> 00:28:21,571
they know,

1024
00:28:21,571 --> 00:28:21,811
you know,

1025
00:28:21,811 --> 00:28:22,970
they take their id.

1026
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:23,910
Sounds like the way to go.

1027
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,500
We're going to do it regardless.

1028
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:26,350
It should,

1029
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:31,110
I mean legal fuck someone for free,

1030
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:32,213
which it is.

1031
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:35,070
Why isn't it legal to
fuck someone from money?

1032
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:35,963
What's the difference?

1033
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:40,170
If it's legal to give
someone a massage from money,

1034
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:42,240
why isn't it legal to stick to?

1035
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,640
Because that guy's an
essential and all free.

1036
00:28:44,641 --> 00:28:49,641
Him Free me to consensual adults
and all my nerve endings are,

1037
00:28:49,981 --> 00:28:53,940
they're two consenting adults and all
my nerve endings and I want to relax.

1038
00:28:54,210 --> 00:28:59,210
I can't let the guy probably jam his
ring finger right in my shit or strong

1039
00:28:59,791 --> 00:29:01,410
lower back issue I do.

1040
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:04,940
You can't have him jam his ring finger
and his middle finger right up my shit.

1041
00:29:04,941 --> 00:29:06,960
Her Louise couple digits.

1042
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,670
What's no matter with that opening again,

1043
00:29:08,930 --> 00:29:09,840
