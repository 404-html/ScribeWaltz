1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,680
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:03,030
When I lived in New York,

3
00:00:03,031 --> 00:00:03,960
I had a friend,

4
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:04,560
uh,

5
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:05,393
who,

6
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:09,210
one of his friends knew the guy's
a fucking cock odd connection,

7
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:10,381
but it was a,

8
00:00:10,381 --> 00:00:10,800
there was,

9
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,280
there were all in music business
like rock and roll guys.

10
00:00:14,281 --> 00:00:18,600
Like one of them was in this band and he
knew a dude who somehow or another new,

11
00:00:18,601 --> 00:00:22,890
someone who bought Jackie Gleason's
old home and Jackie Gleason.

12
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:24,450
This is the story.

13
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:27,110
Jackie Gleason is obviously third hand,

14
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:28,410
it could be total horsemen.

15
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:29,573
That's it.

16
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:30,420
The story was,

17
00:00:30,421 --> 00:00:31,350
and it's a fun story.

18
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:35,790
The Jackie Gleason was drinking with
Nixon and him and Nixon were buddies and

19
00:00:35,791 --> 00:00:36,031
that,

20
00:00:36,031 --> 00:00:36,271
you know,

21
00:00:36,271 --> 00:00:40,550
they're talking football and throwing
back some fucking Jack and cokes and a

22
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,540
Nixon's like you want
to see a fucking Ufo.

23
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:44,003
So they get,

24
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:49,100
they get an air force one and they fly
some military base where they've got a

25
00:00:49,741 --> 00:00:54,741
crashed flying saucer and Jackie
Gleason from then on becomes a crazy,

26
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,730
a UFO believer.

27
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:01,940
And Jackie Gleason has this backyard in
upstate New York and he has a fake Ufo

28
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:06,630
designed and built in his driveway
to replicate the thing that he saw.

29
00:01:06,631 --> 00:01:09,750
He hires a bunch of people
to try to recreate something.

30
00:01:09,751 --> 00:01:11,640
He puts it together in his head,

31
00:01:11,641 --> 00:01:13,230
sort of like a crime sketch.

32
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:14,910
Like you would try to reenact it.

33
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:17,560
Funny Story.

34
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:18,563
That's the fun.

35
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:20,330
Do you believe it?

36
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:22,230
I would like to find my,

37
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:22,640
my,

38
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,000
I did fuck up my computer.

39
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:24,834
It's not working.

40
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:26,330
Luckily I've got backups.

41
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,360
[inaudible] yeah,

42
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:29,453
you're drunk.

43
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:31,380
Why don't you get your slurry mix slurs.

44
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,470
How'd you get that chemical that you
could just put it on your computer?

45
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:34,343
Are we good idea?

46
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,060
Um,

47
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:35,620
all right buddy.

48
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:37,710
But I don't know if
Jackie Gleason really did.

49
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:38,730
Why don't you Google it?

50
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:43,200
Find out did Jackie Gleason a really
wasn't really any UFO was Jackie Gleason

51
00:01:43,201 --> 00:01:44,034
and the Ufos,

52
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:44,901
it'll I,

53
00:01:44,901 --> 00:01:45,091
well,

54
00:01:45,091 --> 00:01:46,140
Joe Rogan once said,

55
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,960
I spread my own fucking
like the PTO inflation.

56
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,180
I like the story.

57
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:52,140
I'll make up a story.

58
00:01:52,141 --> 00:01:52,380
Dot.

59
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:53,160
Not even realize it.

60
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:53,820
Made it up.

61
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:57,180
Put it out there and then I'll find
it on Wikipedia and I'll use it as a

62
00:01:57,181 --> 00:02:00,030
reference to prove when
I tell the story again,

63
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:01,640
trip to the alien morgue.

64
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:03,091
Wow.

65
00:02:03,091 --> 00:02:05,400
So this is a real rumor to the moon,

66
00:02:05,401 --> 00:02:05,820
Alice.

67
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:07,630
There was a time when you could say that.

68
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:09,300
Scroll that down.

69
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:11,363
Stop,

70
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:12,060
go back,

71
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,170
collaborate and listen.

72
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:14,063
Stop right there.

73
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:15,660
You're fucking drunk as shit,

74
00:02:15,661 --> 00:02:16,494
dude.

75
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:17,430
Uh,

76
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:19,340
there was another size Jenkins,

77
00:02:19,341 --> 00:02:20,280
extremely serious,

78
00:02:20,281 --> 00:02:24,770
I'm sure UFO researcher and prided
himself on the huge collection of Ufr

79
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:25,740
[inaudible] books,

80
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:28,800
which numbered into the thousands
the see I call bullshit.

81
00:02:28,801 --> 00:02:29,634
You know why?

82
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:32,410
I doubt there's thousands of
books written you a false,

83
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:34,123
put it back up.

84
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,220
What more could you say?

85
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:35,610
Like,

86
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:35,971
Oh,

87
00:02:35,971 --> 00:02:36,391
uh,

88
00:02:36,391 --> 00:02:36,811
you know,

89
00:02:36,811 --> 00:02:38,370
and then he saw light too.

90
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:41,190
As soon as the new title came out,

91
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:42,450
even a Europe or the UK,

92
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,650
Jackie had a copy.

93
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:44,603
Hmm.

94
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:45,450
Well,

95
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:46,380
I don't know if it's true.

96
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:47,490
Um,

97
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:50,650
but that was the store that
this guy told me about house.

98
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:51,720
It's a dope story.

99
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:53,431
If that's true,

100
00:02:53,431 --> 00:02:57,900
if the Jackie Gleason really was some
sort of a crazy UFO fanatic and that

101
00:02:57,901 --> 00:02:58,790
that's the motivator,

102
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:01,120
more match and if it's fucking true,

103
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:01,581
oh,

104
00:03:01,581 --> 00:03:02,110
it's all true.

105
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:05,020
What a beautiful thing it would be if
they really did have like a hanger 18 you

106
00:03:05,021 --> 00:03:09,310
know what I want when we're old and
we're sitting on the cove drinking our

107
00:03:09,311 --> 00:03:10,090
drink,

108
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:14,590
looking at the water just mean you gray
or silver bags and someone's going to

109
00:03:14,591 --> 00:03:15,250
go,

110
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:16,083
you know what,

111
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,470
fucking Jackie Gleason went
to area 51 and saw that shit.

112
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:23,200
I wonder what's going to happen.

113
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:24,881
Yeah,

114
00:03:24,881 --> 00:03:25,480
I wonder.

115
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,620
I wonder if it will happen.

116
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:29,020
I wonder if they really do have something.

117
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:29,410
I mean,

118
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:30,243
that would be,

119
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:33,450
I would wish one person who was lid,

120
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:35,770
legitimately intelligent who was dying,

121
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:36,990
which spill the beans.

122
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:39,610
I wish every dude that
spills the beans like,

123
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,480
man,

124
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:42,820
you're a fucking Weirdo.

125
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,680
I'm not my by one chive and with my one
thing is how impossible would it be to

126
00:03:50,501 --> 00:03:53,470
keep a secret and today it
would be too impossible.

127
00:03:53,471 --> 00:03:53,861
You know?

128
00:03:53,861 --> 00:03:55,310
One person would say something.

129
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:57,340
I don't agree with that because they look,

130
00:03:57,341 --> 00:03:59,880
they kept a secret when they were
making the Manhattan project,

131
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:01,720
but that was a different era.

132
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:03,340
What one thing I will say,

133
00:04:03,341 --> 00:04:08,341
one thing is maybe those movies and
TV shows and leaks and everyone,

134
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,560
because we're all like,

135
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:11,940
oh yeah,

136
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:13,930
area 51 of course it's the aliens.

137
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:15,460
Like maybe that's,

138
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:16,720
you know,

139
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,560
maybe that's part of it.

140
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:18,251
Well look,

141
00:04:18,251 --> 00:04:19,830
we know that secrets can be kept.

142
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:25,180
Secrets totally can be kept because we
didn't find out about the Gulf of Tonkin

143
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,350
until like way,

144
00:04:26,351 --> 00:04:27,184
way late.

145
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:29,830
Like there was some people involved
in the Gulf of Tonkin incident.

146
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:31,080
When did it become mainstream?

147
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:32,800
Now look,

148
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:33,581
30 years,

149
00:04:33,581 --> 00:04:35,920
40 years secrets can be kept.

150
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:36,820
Yeah.

151
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:40,030
But nowadays it's,

152
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:40,480
it's,

153
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,260
it's pretty deep.

154
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:42,520
Secrets can be kept out.

155
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:47,230
Wouldn't the most important
secret be we found aliens.

156
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:50,080
That would be like one of the greatest
secrets you would ever want to keep.

157
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:54,610
Like the last thing we want is these
motherfuckers just freaking out because

158
00:04:54,611 --> 00:04:55,444
there's aliens.

159
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,100
I liked the movies though,

160
00:04:57,101 --> 00:04:58,150
where it's just a given.

161
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:58,511
They're like,

162
00:04:58,511 --> 00:04:58,721
yeah,

163
00:04:58,721 --> 00:05:02,260
well we just got the
spaceships from area 51 yeah.

164
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:03,880
How many movies in that though?

165
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:05,013
A lot.

166
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:09,910
Most movies when they try to depict what
it would be like if we were attacked,

167
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,230
it's fucking terrible.

168
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:15,070
I like the fact that we started
off with saving democracy and,

169
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:15,671
well,

170
00:05:15,671 --> 00:05:18,540
you got drunk along the way and
so it shifted to alien power.

171
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:19,520
Standard area.

172
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,033
Bitch,

173
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,420
when are you going looking for him?

174
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:22,931
Come on.

175
00:05:22,931 --> 00:05:25,690
You and dean Cain fucking get up.

176
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:27,820
He's got that show on spike.

177
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:29,590
I'll do it as a girl.

178
00:05:29,591 --> 00:05:30,880
Ever scored it on you before.

179
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:33,430
Are you reading my brain?

180
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,690
Are you part of the MSA?

181
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:36,250
Is this,

182
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:39,010
is this lion's drunk?

183
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:42,880
The NSA has given you all my
information having recently.

184
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:46,930
All right.

185
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:47,980
I love you guys.

186
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,233
Wow.

187
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:50,171
Brian,

188
00:05:50,171 --> 00:05:51,070
I love you.

189
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:01,020
Okay.
