00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,570
Welcome to a very special weekend edition,

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,550
a late night weekend edition.

3
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:09,480
If you're on the east coast,

4
00:00:09,481 --> 00:00:10,440
it's 1130.

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,090
If you're in Hawaii right now,

6
00:00:12,091 --> 00:00:13,140
you're not impressed.

7
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:15,930
It's only five to five 24,

8
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:18,420
so 1124 on the east coast.

9
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:19,351
Um,

10
00:00:19,351 --> 00:00:20,610

any and all supplements.

14
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:31,960
We're going to keep it
simple cause that's the case.

15
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:32,823
You may kiss her son.

16
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:33,540
Oh,

17
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:33,970
that guy,

18
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:34,890
we met him this weekend.

19
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:35,801
The dude who,

20
00:00:35,801 --> 00:00:36,000
uh,

21
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:36,840
is in the on it,

22
00:00:36,841 --> 00:00:37,980
a power commercial,

23
00:00:37,981 --> 00:00:38,814
the power lifter.

24
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:39,301
Very,

25
00:00:39,301 --> 00:00:42,840
very cool dude with his
also very cool girlfriend.

26
00:00:42,841 --> 00:00:46,860
And it was hilarious because they were
so happy that we should all over the part

27
00:00:46,861 --> 00:00:48,690
of the commercial where he
hangs out with the girls.

28
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:52,320
She was so mad about that because
at the end of the commercial,

29
00:00:52,321 --> 00:00:52,460
the,

30
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:53,081
this is a,

31
00:00:53,081 --> 00:00:53,300
a,

32
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:56,940
a commercial for a testosterone
supplement called t plus.

33
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:01,890
And what t plus does is it naturally
stimulates your body to produce more

34
00:01:01,891 --> 00:01:02,980
testosterone than this.

35
00:01:02,981 --> 00:01:04,650
A commercial with this power lifter dude.

36
00:01:04,651 --> 00:01:05,040
Well,

37
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:05,821
in the beginning of it,

38
00:01:05,821 --> 00:01:06,990
it's just him lifting weights.

39
00:01:06,991 --> 00:01:08,040
All of it makes sense.

40
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:08,491
You know?

41
00:01:08,491 --> 00:01:09,324
But then the end of it,

42
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:13,040
it was him with two girls at a
bar and it was like being Mr Sexy.

43
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,310
We need to get a copy of it,

44
00:01:14,311 --> 00:01:17,790
cause I need to see it and took
that shit off the Internet so fast.

45
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:18,450
And you already said,

46
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:20,250
I guess I said in one
of the podcasts I said,

47
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,620
I don't want to be like this
guy or like look like this guy.

48
00:01:22,621 --> 00:01:23,281
So he comes up to me,

49
00:01:23,281 --> 00:01:23,550
he goes,

50
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:24,570
I don't want to look like you,

51
00:01:24,571 --> 00:01:24,901
man.

52
00:01:24,901 --> 00:01:25,321
I'm going to wait.

53
00:01:25,321 --> 00:01:25,531
What?

54
00:01:25,531 --> 00:01:25,831
Wait,

55
00:01:25,831 --> 00:01:26,664
where are you?

56
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:27,120
And I'm like,

57
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:27,241
Oh,

58
00:01:27,241 --> 00:01:29,340
you're kissing muscle tote was stop.

59
00:01:29,341 --> 00:01:30,840
You're not telling the truth at all.

60
00:01:30,841 --> 00:01:30,991
You know,

61
00:01:30,991 --> 00:01:31,411
fuck.

62
00:01:31,411 --> 00:01:32,610
You distort reality.

63
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,040
He came up to you and
told you the whole thing.

64
00:01:35,041 --> 00:01:35,341
You didn't,

65
00:01:35,341 --> 00:01:36,210
you knew who he was.

66
00:01:36,211 --> 00:01:36,961
Exactly.

67
00:01:36,961 --> 00:01:37,290
Yeah.

68
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:37,930
But he said,

69
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:39,160
and he tweeted it to you,

70
00:01:39,161 --> 00:01:39,871
well fuck you man.

71
00:01:39,871 --> 00:01:40,700
I don't want to be like,

72
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,060
I had no idea who that was.

73
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:42,240
Okay.

74
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,170
I just thought it was a hater.

75
00:01:43,171 --> 00:01:43,951
I probably blocked him.

76
00:01:43,951 --> 00:01:44,161
I was like,

77
00:01:44,161 --> 00:01:44,400
what?

78
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,270
I don't want to be like you either.

79
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:46,230
What the fuck that mean?

80
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,153
Whatever.

81
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,200
But he was super nice and I
accidentally put a sticker in this

82
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,000
girlfriend's hair.

83
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:51,480
Yeah,

84
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,111
Brian was,

85
00:01:52,111 --> 00:01:54,790
he thought it was being cute but putting
desk wants stickers on the pack of

86
00:01:54,791 --> 00:01:56,490
people's back when I was taking photos,

87
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:58,133

88
00:01:58,830 --> 00:01:59,670
silly bitch.

89
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:00,380
Anyway,

but I won't even bother since July.

105
00:02:23,731 --> 00:02:24,564
Yeah,

106
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:25,853
it's too far away.

107
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:26,901
All right,

108
00:02:26,901 --> 00:02:28,850
Dr. Steven Greer is here.

109
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:32,330
We are going to get to the
bottom of a lot of crazy shit.

110
00:02:32,331 --> 00:02:33,170
Ladies and gentlemen,

111
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:36,850
this is one of the most requested
guests ever on the podcast choosing,

112
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:37,431
choosing music.

113
00:02:37,431 --> 00:02:38,264
Brian,

114
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:39,950
let's get this thing started officially.

115
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:43,760
Well,

116
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,880
good experience

117
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,353
[inaudible]

118
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:55,680
our guests today for folks
who are tuning into this,

119
00:02:55,681 --> 00:02:56,100
um,

120
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,500
ironically a on Sirius satellite radio,

121
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:00,100
they don't hear the commercial part

122
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:00,550
of it.

123
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:01,900
A Dr. Steven Greer,

124
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:03,550
if you don't know who Dr. Greer is,

125
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:06,430
there's a thing that a lot of
people are aware of that came out.

126
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,650
This was at 20 2011.

127
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,850
The disclosure project,

128
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12,090
was it 2001 2000 was,

129
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:12,821
did I say 11?

130
00:03:12,821 --> 00:03:13,361
I met one.

131
00:03:13,361 --> 00:03:15,250
I meant right around September 11th.

132
00:03:15,251 --> 00:03:15,400
Right?

133
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,810
That's where the 11 came from my head.

134
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:17,500
Um,

135
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,640
2001,

136
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:18,970
uh,

137
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:20,500
it was a huge,

138
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:21,010
uh,

139
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:21,790
in the Internet,

140
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:25,170
a huge point of controversy and a,

141
00:03:25,171 --> 00:03:26,620
a topic of conversation.

142
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:28,000
It was you,

143
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:28,601
uh,

144
00:03:28,601 --> 00:03:31,990
on stage introducing
this disclosure project,

145
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:37,020
explaining how much information
you had access to about,

146
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:37,780
uh,

147
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:42,370
alien spacecrafts visiting earth and
how many distinguished high ranking

148
00:03:42,371 --> 00:03:43,540
military people.

149
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:45,490
And that was where it got shocking.

150
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:46,091
Uh,

151
00:03:46,091 --> 00:03:46,751
agreed with you.

152
00:03:46,751 --> 00:03:50,770
That was where it got shocking because
that was the first time we'd ever seen

153
00:03:50,771 --> 00:03:52,630
like high ranking military officers,

154
00:03:52,631 --> 00:03:54,070
one after another,

155
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:59,220
testify that they had personal encounters
with things that are not of this

156
00:03:59,561 --> 00:04:00,040
world.

157
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:04,000
People who would know the difference
between black ops technology,

158
00:04:04,001 --> 00:04:04,221
the,

159
00:04:04,221 --> 00:04:05,054
the current,

160
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:05,440
uh,

161
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:10,440
military defense projects that might be
secret and people that would know also

162
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:15,760
who to talk to about these things if
they did think it was a black ops,

163
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:17,710
but they knew they,

164
00:04:17,711 --> 00:04:18,544
and it was,

165
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,750
in my opinion,

166
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:24,400
that video is probably one of the most
important videos ever when it comes to

167
00:04:24,401 --> 00:04:28,660
extra terrestrial life or the idea of
extraterrestrial life visiting earth.

168
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:34,110
Because the conversations that I've ever
had that I've always had with rational

169
00:04:34,481 --> 00:04:35,190
people,

170
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:35,510
um,

171
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:39,250
especially rational people who are not
obsessed by aliens like I've been my

172
00:04:39,251 --> 00:04:39,970
whole life,

173
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:41,350
but rational people who just,

174
00:04:41,351 --> 00:04:41,771
you know,

175
00:04:41,771 --> 00:04:42,131
oh,

176
00:04:42,131 --> 00:04:43,000
I don't know.

177
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:44,500
I don't know if it's real or not,

178
00:04:44,501 --> 00:04:45,191
but you know,

179
00:04:45,191 --> 00:04:45,520
where,

180
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:45,790
where,

181
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:46,630
where's the evidence?

182
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:48,670
I'm sure there's alien life out there.

183
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:49,960
Has it visited us?

184
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:50,970
Oh,

185
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:51,370
I don't,

186
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:52,390
I probably not.

187
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:52,960
Right.

188
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:57,100
When you see that video and you see
those high ranking military guys,

189
00:04:57,101 --> 00:04:58,660
one after another,

190
00:04:58,661 --> 00:05:00,220
give these very,

191
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:02,560
not just believable,

192
00:05:02,561 --> 00:05:03,610
but they're kind of,

193
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:04,040
they're,

194
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:04,691
they're spooky.

195
00:05:04,691 --> 00:05:07,600
These are spooky stories because
the way they're talking about him,

196
00:05:07,601 --> 00:05:11,740
you could see in their face the
emotions as they're recounting the,

197
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:12,940
just the sheer,

198
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:14,590
to use a word alien,

199
00:05:14,591 --> 00:05:15,850
this of their experience,

200
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:16,713
right?

201
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,090
We had never really seen
anything like that before.

202
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,080
It had always been,

203
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:20,411
well,

204
00:05:20,411 --> 00:05:23,260
I guess they probably could be out there,

205
00:05:23,261 --> 00:05:24,520
but who knows.

206
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:26,770
When I watched that video,

207
00:05:26,771 --> 00:05:27,604
it was a real,

208
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:28,520
uh,

209
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:33,520
it was a real shift because it was one
of the first things that I ever saw that

210
00:05:33,821 --> 00:05:35,320
made me really stop and think.

211
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:39,160
There's a part of everybody
that doesn't want to get duped.

212
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,660
And when it comes to a subject,

213
00:05:40,661 --> 00:05:42,790
especially an important subject like Ufos,

214
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:44,760
there's a part of
everybody who goes there.

215
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:47,770
You want to call bullshit right away
because you don't want to be the last guy

216
00:05:47,771 --> 00:05:48,604
to call bullshit.

217
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:50,710
You don't want to be the guy who believes,

218
00:05:50,711 --> 00:05:51,191
believes,

219
00:05:51,191 --> 00:05:51,761
believes,

220
00:05:51,761 --> 00:05:52,720
and it turns into bullshit.

221
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:53,051
Ah,

222
00:05:53,051 --> 00:05:53,651
you dummy,

223
00:05:53,651 --> 00:05:55,000
you believed that you were the first guy.

224
00:05:55,001 --> 00:05:55,840
I believe in it man.

225
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,780
You want to be the first
guy to call bullshit.

226
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:59,660
It's always a way cooler position.

227
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:01,010
And um,

228
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:01,880
if,

229
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,920
if there was alien life,

230
00:06:03,921 --> 00:06:07,250
if there was an life that
had visited the earth,

231
00:06:07,251 --> 00:06:08,084
excuse me,

232
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:08,840
what,

233
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,060
what evidence would they leave behind?

234
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:11,450
What,

235
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:13,940
what would you know in
your day to day existence?

236
00:06:13,941 --> 00:06:15,680
How much of it would you know?

237
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:16,880
Almost nothing

238
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:23,090
like when it's getting hoovered up by
a very well organized and well funded

239
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:25,013
intelligence.

240
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:27,830
The project blue book,

241
00:06:27,831 --> 00:06:29,390
which was run by Jay,

242
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:30,740
Dr Jay Allen Heineken,

243
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:30,950
right?

244
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:32,780
That was a cover story project.

245
00:06:32,781 --> 00:06:36,830
Blue Book was really a little office where
they were putting things in there and

246
00:06:36,831 --> 00:06:38,750
making it sound like they
were really investigating.

247
00:06:38,751 --> 00:06:39,111
Meanwhile,

248
00:06:39,111 --> 00:06:39,980
there was a uh,

249
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,480
unacknowledged project,

250
00:06:41,481 --> 00:06:42,650
what we call it black project,

251
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:45,830
but the proper name is an
unacknowledged special access project.

252
00:06:45,831 --> 00:06:50,020
Are you SAP and the use saps running
this had been around since the 40

253
00:06:50,021 --> 00:06:52,970
[inaudible] very well funded
working on these issues,

254
00:06:52,971 --> 00:06:54,250
working on the technology,

255
00:06:54,251 --> 00:06:57,470
studying how these things are going
from one star system to another.

256
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,870
And that's the sort of thing that,

257
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:02,210
that we've been drilling
down on for about 22 years.

258
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:05,880
So the project Blue Book
that was run by Dr Heinik,

259
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:06,121
is that,

260
00:07:06,121 --> 00:07:06,954
what's his name,

261
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:07,700
it Dr J.

262
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:07,701
Dot.

263
00:07:07,701 --> 00:07:08,590
Allen Hynek right.

264
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:09,850
He was an air force guy,

265
00:07:09,851 --> 00:07:12,510
a astronomer that the air
force engaged to do that.

266
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:15,900
Later he came out and admitted
that that was all just sort of a,

267
00:07:15,901 --> 00:07:17,290
a dog and pony show.

268
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:20,250
And he also became a huge UFO believer,

269
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:24,060
which is really fascinating because most
of the stories that they investigated

270
00:07:24,061 --> 00:07:25,140
in project blue book,

271
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,490
he sorted debunked.

272
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,030
Correct.

273
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:27,840
In fact,

274
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,780
instead of being open
about the possibilities,

275
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,970
they always steered towards debunking

276
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:33,600
first.

277
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,050
Right.

278
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:39,050
And actually the big problem became when
he put his foot in his mouth when a,

279
00:07:39,421 --> 00:07:41,820
in Gerald Ford's a home
district in Michigan,

280
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:43,340
there was a whole,

281
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:43,770
uh,

282
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:46,560
dozens of people who saw an
extraterrestrial vehicle,

283
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:47,251
um,

284
00:07:47,251 --> 00:07:48,510
that was some maneuvering,

285
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:49,050
um,

286
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:50,070
at close range.

287
00:07:50,071 --> 00:07:54,180
And he went up and investigate it and
made some reference to it being swamp gas.

288
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:54,971
And,

289
00:07:54,971 --> 00:07:55,290
uh,

290
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:58,590
Gerald Ford went ballistic because
his constituents went ballistic.

291
00:07:58,591 --> 00:08:03,591
And Gerald Ford actually had an inquiry
into it while he was a member of the

292
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:05,130
House of Representatives
course later as president,

293
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:09,240
he never dealt with this issue because
basically the presidential intelligence

294
00:08:09,241 --> 00:08:11,250
doesn't have access to those projects.

295
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:12,540
When you say that,

296
00:08:12,541 --> 00:08:12,810
uh,

297
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:15,690
he said it was swamp gas that Jay
on Hynix said it was swamp cast.

298
00:08:15,691 --> 00:08:20,030
So you were saying that Ford objected
because he knew it was an extraterrestrial

299
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:20,790
vehicle.

300
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:21,080
He,

301
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,210
he knew that his,

302
00:08:22,211 --> 00:08:26,050
some of his constituents who were very
credible knew it was something real.

303
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,190
What was his position then?

304
00:08:27,191 --> 00:08:28,024
What was he,

305
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,050
he was actually a believed
it was real as the,

306
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:31,330
no,

307
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:31,481
no,

308
00:08:31,481 --> 00:08:31,841
I mean,

309
00:08:31,841 --> 00:08:32,021
uh,

310
00:08:32,021 --> 00:08:32,800
in government,

311
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:33,910
what is prepared

312
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,570
precedent?

313
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:34,721
Yeah,

314
00:08:34,721 --> 00:08:34,861
it was,

315
00:08:34,861 --> 00:08:35,200
he was,

316
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,150
he was in the House of
Representatives in the congress.

317
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:40,750
He was a congressman before he was
a vice president and then president.

318
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:44,040
And so he was upset that they were
saying that it wasn't a real vehicle.

319
00:08:44,041 --> 00:08:45,980
So he clamped down on it.

320
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:46,421
Yeah.

321
00:08:46,421 --> 00:08:47,050
And actually hold,

322
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:50,440
held a hearing where a lot of people
came and gave evidence and information,

323
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:52,990
but it didn't go anywhere
because it's Washington.

324
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:54,550
Nothing ever goes anywhere in Washington.

325
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,590
And,

326
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:56,070
um,

327
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:57,050
so you know,

328
00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:02,510
I started as founder of disclosure
project.org and now serious disclosure.

329
00:09:02,611 --> 00:09:03,060
Dot.

330
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:03,810
Calm.

331
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:05,390
We began investigating this in,

332
00:09:05,391 --> 00:09:05,910
in uh,

333
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:07,550
1990 and you know,

334
00:09:07,551 --> 00:09:08,550
I'm a trauma doctor,

335
00:09:08,551 --> 00:09:13,020
emergency doctor who was running a
very busy er and raising four kids.

336
00:09:13,021 --> 00:09:15,360
And I got involved with this because,

337
00:09:15,361 --> 00:09:15,740
um,

338
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:17,100
I knew about it since childhood.

339
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:18,061
And you know,

340
00:09:18,061 --> 00:09:18,391
my,

341
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:19,130
uh,

342
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:19,350
uh,

343
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:19,981
I have family,

344
00:09:19,981 --> 00:09:20,290
my,

345
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:21,420
my mom's brother,

346
00:09:21,421 --> 00:09:25,230
uncle was a engineer that worked on the
lunar module and I had an interest in

347
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:26,460
this and so I was a little child.

348
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:27,390
Um,

349
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:29,160
so the thing that put knew
learning strong on the,

350
00:09:29,161 --> 00:09:29,641
on the moon,

351
00:09:29,641 --> 00:09:30,960
my family had a hand in that.

352
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:35,730
So I think that what most people don't
realize is that inside the intelligence

353
00:09:35,731 --> 00:09:36,061
community,

354
00:09:36,061 --> 00:09:37,140
the aerospace community,

355
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,160
um,

356
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,850
there are a lot of people who are
very knowledgeable about this,

357
00:09:41,851 --> 00:09:43,170
but they're not allowed to talk about it.

358
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,640
It's a career ender for most of them.

359
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:47,550
And that was what we did
for disclosure project,

360
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,590
was to put all those folks together,

361
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:50,671
identify them.

362
00:09:50,671 --> 00:09:53,490
So I spent about 10 years
identifying who these people were in.

363
00:09:53,491 --> 00:09:55,590
First I had maybe half a dozen of them.

364
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,510
Now we have over 500,

365
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:58,380
about 550.

366
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,610
Who was the most credible people?

367
00:09:59,611 --> 00:10:02,220
Just so folks listening to this
that haven't watched that video,

368
00:10:02,221 --> 00:10:03,600
who are the most credible people?

369
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:03,961
Well,

370
00:10:03,961 --> 00:10:05,280
we're going to have some
of them in the film.

371
00:10:05,281 --> 00:10:06,060
Serious.

372
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:06,560
You know this,

373
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,040
I'm like,

374
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:08,731
sir,

375
00:10:08,731 --> 00:10:09,360
I us,

376
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,570
I'm serious.

377
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:10,831
Uh,

378
00:10:10,831 --> 00:10:11,730
is going to,

379
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,300
um,

380
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:15,570
have a lot of this information at it and
some stuff is going to blow your mind,

381
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:18,510
including the possibility
of an actual body,

382
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:19,820
um,

383
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:22,140
a humanoid body that we're investigating.

384
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:24,570
And we'll get into this in a moment.

385
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:25,201
And when you see it,

386
00:10:25,201 --> 00:10:27,270
you're going to go really my God.

387
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:28,980
But you know,

388
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:34,010
these witnesses that we have
who are military go from
the head of investigations

389
00:10:34,051 --> 00:10:35,010
for the FAA,

390
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:38,610
John Callahan to people
like Gordon Cooper,

391
00:10:38,611 --> 00:10:40,980
who was one of the early
Mercury astronauts who,

392
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:41,670
uh,

393
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:44,160
his crew actually filmed
one of these extra tests,

394
00:10:44,161 --> 00:10:47,040
will vehicles landing on a dry
lake bed out here near Edwards.

395
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:49,850
And he looked at the film and
send it on a Pentagon plane.

396
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:51,480
And now the backstory to this,

397
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:52,480
now this is the go give,

398
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:57,450
giving you an idea of how labyrinthine
and screwed up Washington's become and

399
00:10:57,451 --> 00:10:58,310
what Eisenhower said,

400
00:10:58,311 --> 00:10:58,681
what he said,

401
00:10:58,681 --> 00:11:01,500
but where are the military industrial
complex because it's going to get out of

402
00:11:01,501 --> 00:11:03,270
control and be a threat to our democracy.

403
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,040
Gordon Cooper,

404
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:05,550
you know,

405
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:10,550
very heroic early astronauts had detailed
information what we call actionable

406
00:11:10,591 --> 00:11:12,900
intelligence on that event,

407
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:17,930
this landing of a vehicle in
broad daylight near Edwards
air force base in 1956.

408
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:21,000
Now when Clinton was president,

409
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,060
Gordon Cooper asked,

410
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:24,751
uh,

411
00:11:24,751 --> 00:11:26,640
was asked by the Secretary of Defense,

412
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:29,340
William Cohen about this issue.

413
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:29,731
And he says,

414
00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:29,941
yes,

415
00:11:29,941 --> 00:11:33,360
I absolutely will verify this and I'll
give you the information when and where

416
00:11:33,361 --> 00:11:34,194
and how it happened.

417
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:39,350
So the secretary of Defense of the
United States of America had this

418
00:11:39,361 --> 00:11:40,081
information,

419
00:11:40,081 --> 00:11:43,710
made an inquiry through channels
and came up with a dry hole.

420
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:44,910
Basically this stuff,

421
00:11:44,911 --> 00:11:48,300
it's all been put into a
parallel universe that,

422
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:51,930
that senior people in our
government have for the most part,

423
00:11:51,931 --> 00:11:52,764
no access to.

424
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:53,411
Now,

425
00:11:53,411 --> 00:11:54,100
I would not

426
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:57,970
have believed that if I hadn't been the
guy who was brought to Washington during

427
00:11:57,971 --> 00:12:01,360
the Clinton years to do the
briefing for the CIA director.

428
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:03,370
And I was asked to go up there,

429
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:04,120
uh,

430
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:04,871
as a service.

431
00:12:04,871 --> 00:12:05,381
And I did it,

432
00:12:05,381 --> 00:12:10,381
left my er and I put together a whole
lot of these early witnesses' testimony,

433
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:11,860
photographs,

434
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:14,620
some really amazing government
documents that we acquired,

435
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:17,110
some through channels I
don't want to talk about.

436
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,780
And I put this briefing together.

437
00:12:19,781 --> 00:12:22,690
And so I go up there and
here's the city CIA director,

438
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:24,063
um,

439
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:24,260
uh,

440
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:25,270
our James Woolsey.

441
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:27,010
And um,

442
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:28,511
his wife was there,

443
00:12:28,511 --> 00:12:29,321
who was at the time,

444
00:12:29,321 --> 00:12:32,110
the chief operating officer of
the National Academy of Sciences.

445
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:35,620
And when I was first invited to go
up there and brief the CIA director,

446
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:36,670
I was told,

447
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:39,880
they want you to come up here because
President Clinton and he have inquired

448
00:12:39,881 --> 00:12:42,190
about this subject and
they're being denied access.

449
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,690
Now I have a letter proving this.

450
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:46,690
President Clinton has been denied access.

451
00:12:46,691 --> 00:12:51,691
So they want you a doctor in who had a
family connection to these programs and,

452
00:12:51,951 --> 00:12:55,690
and also to information
they know about you.

453
00:12:57,370 --> 00:12:57,521
Well,

454
00:12:57,521 --> 00:12:59,710
let me finish this other
thread and I'll get to that.

455
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:00,843
Um,

456
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:03,160
because that's they're
blowing your mind even more.

457
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:04,780
But what happened is that,

458
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:05,200
um,

459
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:05,391
I,

460
00:13:05,391 --> 00:13:07,780
I really thought this was crap.

461
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:08,650
I mean,

462
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:10,180
because when his handler,

463
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:11,270
the CIA director,

464
00:13:11,271 --> 00:13:12,970
his handler who contacted me said,

465
00:13:12,971 --> 00:13:13,690
look,

466
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:14,260
uh,

467
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:18,100
they need you to come up here
because they can't find out anything.

468
00:13:18,101 --> 00:13:19,450
But they know stuff's going on.

469
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:21,070
I felt they just wanted to pick,

470
00:13:21,071 --> 00:13:22,450
my brain is sort of spooks,

471
00:13:22,451 --> 00:13:22,571
you know,

472
00:13:22,571 --> 00:13:23,910
how spooks will spies.

473
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:25,270
We'll try to just get information.

474
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:30,480
I went up there and the CIA director was
honestly completely in the dark and I

475
00:13:30,761 --> 00:13:31,720
was mortified.

476
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:35,950
And towards the end of this almost three
hour briefing that I did for the CIA

477
00:13:35,951 --> 00:13:36,784
director,

478
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:37,390
um,

479
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:39,700
my wife was with me and I
gave him this white paper,

480
00:13:39,701 --> 00:13:40,750
this position paper that,

481
00:13:40,751 --> 00:13:44,050
a summary of action that the president
needed to take and he needed to take.

482
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:45,460
Um,

483
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:45,911
and he,

484
00:13:45,911 --> 00:13:46,744
he,

485
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:48,210
my hands were shaking cause hang on,

486
00:13:48,211 --> 00:13:52,660
I'm like this 35 year old guy briefing
the sitting CIO director was very

487
00:13:52,661 --> 00:13:53,980
intimidating frankly.

488
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:54,873
Um,

489
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:55,871
and you know,

490
00:13:55,871 --> 00:13:57,010
at the end of it I said,

491
00:13:57,011 --> 00:13:57,191
you know,

492
00:13:57,191 --> 00:14:01,570
we really need you to help disclose this
information because the people need to

493
00:14:01,571 --> 00:14:01,931
know,

494
00:14:01,931 --> 00:14:06,220
but also the technologies that we've
studied and have mastered for 50 years

495
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:07,660
could get us all full hill.

496
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:09,130
We could fix this environment,

497
00:14:09,131 --> 00:14:10,180
we could fix the world's,

498
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:10,750
uh,

499
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:13,660
poverty problems and the geopolitical
problems in the Middle East.

500
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:14,861
And he looked at me,

501
00:14:14,861 --> 00:14:15,161
he says,

502
00:14:15,161 --> 00:14:18,460
how do we disclose that
which we have no access to?

503
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:19,900
And I just thought,

504
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,010
I thought I'd pass out.

505
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:21,281
I said,

506
00:14:21,281 --> 00:14:22,540
what do you mean you have new way?

507
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:24,580
And this was from his mouth to my ears.

508
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,160
And so I learned the hard way,

509
00:14:27,161 --> 00:14:27,521
the very,

510
00:14:27,521 --> 00:14:30,610
very hard way that when you're
dealing with things that are,

511
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:32,560
some people say above top secret,

512
00:14:32,561 --> 00:14:35,950
but the proper name is an
unacknowledged special access project.

513
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:40,240
And we have about a hundred to $200
billion a year and our treasury going into

514
00:14:40,241 --> 00:14:42,010
these rogue operations.

515
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:42,841
And it's a,

516
00:14:42,841 --> 00:14:43,660
it's a criminal.

517
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:44,493
It's outrageous,

518
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:45,050
uh,

519
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:45,550
that,

520
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:45,941
you know,

521
00:14:45,941 --> 00:14:47,440
just because you're the CIA director,

522
00:14:47,441 --> 00:14:50,440
just because you're secretary of defense
or on the Senate intelligence committee

523
00:14:50,441 --> 00:14:51,274
means nothing.

524
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:52,100
Um,

525
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,300
and even the president.

526
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,050
Um,

527
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:55,340
so the reason he,

528
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:58,010
those folks invited me
to come up there is that,

529
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:58,370
um,

530
00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:03,260
the year before I had taken a team
of people out on a beach using some

531
00:15:03,261 --> 00:15:08,261
experimental protocols to contact these
vehicles and the occupants and four of

532
00:15:09,261 --> 00:15:11,390
these UFOs pop into the sky.

533
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:12,140
Just boom,

534
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:12,400
boom,

535
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:12,830
boom,

536
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:13,940
which we have on videotape,

537
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:16,370
not great videotape cause we
didn't have good cameras back then.

538
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:17,601
And uh,

539
00:15:17,601 --> 00:15:21,650
there were a couple of air force officers
and pilots there and this went up

540
00:15:21,651 --> 00:15:22,730
through the chain of command.

541
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,050
Few months later,

542
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,990
the former head of army intelligence
invites me to a meeting and then some

543
00:15:26,991 --> 00:15:30,320
national security agency people
do and one thing leads to another.

544
00:15:30,321 --> 00:15:34,480
And I'm being invited to brief the
city of CIA director so that you know,

545
00:15:34,481 --> 00:15:37,910
that you contacted these spaceships.

546
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:40,340
Well this gets into a discussion when,

547
00:15:40,341 --> 00:15:40,611
you know,

548
00:15:40,611 --> 00:15:42,650
that's complex.

549
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:43,543
Uh,

550
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:45,020
but yes,

551
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,450
and you can do that at any time.

552
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:48,770
Well mad at anytime,

553
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:50,990
but I think that under
the right you can do that.

554
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:54,570
There are protocols and we developed
something called the close encounters or

555
00:15:54,571 --> 00:15:55,820
the fifth kind initiative,

556
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:57,980
which is when you use a set of very,

557
00:15:58,030 --> 00:15:59,720
they're very controversial protocols,

558
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:00,740
um,

559
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:05,740
that deal with nonlocality the fact
that the universe has various dimensions

560
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:10,640
that you can move through to go
from one star system to another.

561
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:15,970
But those dimensions that are at higher
resonant fields than say linear space

562
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:16,830
time,

563
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:17,220
uh,

564
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:22,220
or electromagnetism also interface
with what I call coherent thought.

565
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,250
So the Moody Blues were
right when they said,

566
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:27,890
I'm thinking is the best way to travel.

567
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,090
Um,

568
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:31,760
and there's a component to where,

569
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:32,590
you know,

570
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:33,140
I'm pregnant,

571
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:34,160
lose half your listeners,

572
00:16:34,161 --> 00:16:34,980
right?

573
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:35,813
I've got,

574
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:36,660
all right,

575
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:38,030
well pay all you freaks,

576
00:16:38,031 --> 00:16:39,310
listen up and listen apart.

577
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:40,280
Uh,

578
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:44,600
you can develop technologies and we have
these in classified projects now where

579
00:16:44,601 --> 00:16:45,381
you can have a,

580
00:16:45,381 --> 00:16:50,210
what's called a switch that will
interface with very intent thought.

581
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,770
So it's beyond,

582
00:16:51,771 --> 00:16:53,390
forget your iPhone now,

583
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:55,880
if you're traveling from
one star system to another,

584
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:57,320
that's what you're going to be using.

585
00:16:57,321 --> 00:17:01,190
You're going to be using technologies
that are phasing at multiples of the speed

586
00:17:01,191 --> 00:17:02,024
of light.

587
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:07,360
And those dimensions also intersect at
a certain point with coherent thought,

588
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:08,210
just like lightest,

589
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:09,890
coherent a laser is coherent light.

590
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:15,230
And so this gets into the whole question
of how over the history of humanity

591
00:17:15,231 --> 00:17:17,180
have there been so many
reports of contact.

592
00:17:17,181 --> 00:17:17,900
And there are,

593
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:21,910
I mean going all the way back to
the [inaudible] and the Betas to uh,

594
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:22,791
accounts that,

595
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:22,941
you know,

596
00:17:22,941 --> 00:17:25,150
there's a wonderful painting and um,

597
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:26,270
the Middle Ages of,

598
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:27,530
of this exactly.

599
00:17:27,531 --> 00:17:30,200
It looks like a modern
Ufo over the shoulder of,

600
00:17:30,201 --> 00:17:33,260
of Mary holding Jesus.

601
00:17:33,261 --> 00:17:36,080
And a picture that's been
from the 14 hundreds.

602
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:37,820
I've actually seen the original of this.

603
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:39,830
So I think the question becomes,

604
00:17:39,831 --> 00:17:40,400
you know,

605
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:44,330
we probably have always had
extraterrestrial civilizations
observing our little

606
00:17:44,331 --> 00:17:45,164
planet.

607
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:45,980
Um,

608
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:50,490
the question is what happened in the last
50 to a hundred years that really got

609
00:17:50,491 --> 00:17:51,324
their attention.

610
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:55,440
And I'm quite convinced it was when we
started detonating thermonuclear weapons.

611
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:56,760
But my,

612
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:59,910
one of the projects we're involved
with is disclosure project.

613
00:17:59,911 --> 00:18:02,600
And another one is sort of a
citizen's diplomacy efforts.

614
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,180
Saying,

615
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:03,630
look,

616
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:07,170
since our government is dead in the water
on this in terms of the secretary of

617
00:18:07,171 --> 00:18:08,370
state and folks like that,

618
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:09,211
um,

619
00:18:09,211 --> 00:18:12,090
and I know I went up to
the UN and met with um,

620
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:14,100
back when boots was boots with Scalia,

621
00:18:14,101 --> 00:18:17,830
was UN secretary general and brief
these guys and hit her lay layer.

622
00:18:17,831 --> 00:18:18,770
Golly though the wife,

623
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:20,880
the secretary general and I
talked about this in depth and he,

624
00:18:20,881 --> 00:18:23,490
she said they're not going to let
us deal with something like this.

625
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:28,580
So I started a citizens diplomacy effort
back in 1990 but this is actually,

626
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:33,270
and this is the part that I
get ridiculed the most for,

627
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:36,720
but it's the reason why the intelligence
community took it most seriously.

628
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:41,670
It's that they knew that we had discovered
the Rosette of stone of contact and

629
00:18:41,671 --> 00:18:42,840
they were very concerned.

630
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:45,450
Now concern from the covert end,

631
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:48,360
from the end of a lot of
these Washington operatives,

632
00:18:48,361 --> 00:18:49,350
they were just fascinated.

633
00:18:49,351 --> 00:18:52,380
They didn't understand it because
it was sort of pass there,

634
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,850
their scientific understanding,

635
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:54,580
but they should.

636
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:55,413
Very interesting,

637
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,110
this is something,

638
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:57,270
I hate it or interrupt you.

639
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:57,421
No,

640
00:18:57,421 --> 00:19:00,000
please come in and we can't
really just gloss over,

641
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:00,810
um,

642
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:01,230
the,

643
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:05,100
the idea that coherent thought as you say,

644
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,590
intersects with these,

645
00:19:07,591 --> 00:19:07,980
uh,

646
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,180
other levels,

647
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:12,120
these other dimensions that
we can't normally access.

648
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:12,530
Correct.

649
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:13,363
Um,

650
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:18,920
how did you find out about this and how
did you develop the ability on a hot

651
00:19:20,341 --> 00:19:21,300
seat early man?

652
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:21,481
Well,

653
00:19:21,481 --> 00:19:22,410
I need to be need.

654
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,071
You have to,

655
00:19:23,071 --> 00:19:24,210
when you say that you can do that,

656
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:28,410
I mean somehow or another you have
to without getting anybody killed.

657
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:29,873
You have to explain.

658
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:31,820
How'd you figure that out?

659
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:35,510
I figured it out when
I was a teenager and,

660
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:36,373
uh,

661
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:38,810
through a series of experiences I had,

662
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:39,890
uh,

663
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:41,150
and you know,

664
00:19:41,151 --> 00:19:41,421
I was,

665
00:19:41,421 --> 00:19:45,170
I was talking to Thomas Jane who's an
actor here in town about this and I had a

666
00:19:45,171 --> 00:19:46,880
near death experience when I was 17.

667
00:19:46,881 --> 00:19:48,980
It was very sick and,

668
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:49,490
um,

669
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:49,541
uh,

670
00:19:49,541 --> 00:19:50,361
hand experienced.

671
00:19:50,361 --> 00:19:54,860
That took me into some awareness about
the nature of consciousness and the

672
00:19:54,861 --> 00:19:59,360
nonlocality of mind and the fact that
the mind is actually a singularity,

673
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:02,960
that there's really only one mind
and it's just shining through various

674
00:20:02,961 --> 00:20:05,060
individuals appearing as many.

675
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:06,890
And this experience,

676
00:20:06,891 --> 00:20:10,700
although it sounds very spiritual
and religious was very palpable.

677
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:13,490
And I was raised a very devout atheist,

678
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:14,960
so we didn't believe in anything.

679
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:18,920
And so when I realized that this was real,

680
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:20,720
I began to study meditation.

681
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,380
And through that began to have some
experiences where I realize this could

682
00:20:24,381 --> 00:20:24,830
happen.

683
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:26,450
And I had a contact experience.

684
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:27,790
I was 18,

685
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:32,791
it was a few months later in the
fall of 1973 and I was doing this,

686
00:20:33,411 --> 00:20:38,300
I was meditating and then I was doing
what's now called Srv scientific remove

687
00:20:38,301 --> 00:20:41,570
viewing where you use
consciousness to see remote places.

688
00:20:41,571 --> 00:20:42,080
And of course,

689
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,930
army intelligence and the CIA have
experiment with this for years.

690
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,273
Um,

691
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:48,300
which you may or may not know about.

692
00:20:48,301 --> 00:20:49,134
We can get into that.

693
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:49,591
But,

694
00:20:49,591 --> 00:20:50,340
um,

695
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:51,330
I know all those guys.

696
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,580
I know all this RV people and,

697
00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:54,840
but I was as a kid,

698
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:55,351
you know,

699
00:20:55,351 --> 00:20:56,490
and I just turned 18.

700
00:20:56,491 --> 00:20:59,460
I was doing this and suddenly I had
this experience where I thought,

701
00:20:59,461 --> 00:21:00,294
well,

702
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:05,220
what if I tried to go into that state of
one mind that I experienced when I was

703
00:21:05,221 --> 00:21:06,054
a kid,

704
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:06,930
uh,

705
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:07,261
six,

706
00:21:07,261 --> 00:21:09,390
six months earlier when I had
this near death experience.

707
00:21:09,391 --> 00:21:10,224
So I did.

708
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:15,140
And then I had an experience where I
remote viewed and salt eat space and um,

709
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:21,160
could see that there was an eet spacecraft
out there and I made contact and it

710
00:21:21,511 --> 00:21:24,030
appeared and it literally materialized,

711
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:24,660
uh,

712
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:26,130
right near the mountain where I was

713
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:28,710
18.

714
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:29,490
No drugs?

715
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:29,850
No,

716
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:30,001
no.

717
00:21:30,001 --> 00:21:30,834
I've never done any drawer.

718
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:31,773
Never done engines.

719
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:32,450
No.

720
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:32,631
No.

721
00:21:32,631 --> 00:21:33,261
Psychedelics.

722
00:21:33,261 --> 00:21:33,980
Nothing ever.

723
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:34,510
Wow.

724
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:34,940
No.

725
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:35,950
Are you aware,

726
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:37,520
aware of dimethyltryptamine?

727
00:21:37,521 --> 00:21:38,510
Do you know what can I do?

728
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,051
You know,

729
00:21:39,051 --> 00:21:39,884
it's a,

730
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:44,210
supposedly your brain produces it when
you're in periods of extreme stress or

731
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:45,350
near death experiences.

732
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:46,701
And it's,

733
00:21:46,701 --> 00:21:47,420
uh,

734
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:49,910
also the same chemical that's in Iowasca,

735
00:21:49,911 --> 00:21:52,320
which has been used by
indigenous tribes too.

736
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:53,331
Right now.

737
00:21:53,331 --> 00:21:54,164
This was just,

738
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:56,660
this was a very natural
sort of thing that happened.

739
00:21:56,661 --> 00:21:56,750
Yeah.

740
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:56,760
Yeah.

741
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:56,901
But,

742
00:21:56,901 --> 00:21:57,130
but,

743
00:21:57,130 --> 00:22:01,770
but what I'm saying is that these people
that are having these experiences that

744
00:22:01,771 --> 00:22:04,740
are having a lot of people that are
having alien contact experiences,

745
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:07,230
they are all having them
in the middle of the night,

746
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:09,030
like most of them or having them at night.

747
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:10,770
And I'm not discounting this in any way.

748
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:11,581
In fact,

749
00:22:11,581 --> 00:22:13,470
I maybe possibly enhancing the,

750
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,010
uh,

751
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:17,120
the possibility of people
understanding this or the,

752
00:22:17,121 --> 00:22:17,954
the vehicle.

753
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:19,133
Um,

754
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:19,591
the,

755
00:22:19,591 --> 00:22:24,430
the mind produces this dimethyltryptamine
during rem sleep and uh,

756
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:25,450
it's believed it.

757
00:22:25,451 --> 00:22:26,880
So it's still a very sketchy thing.

758
00:22:26,881 --> 00:22:28,350
We know that the body produces it.

759
00:22:28,351 --> 00:22:28,810
We know we,

760
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:30,450
they believe the pineal gland,

761
00:22:30,451 --> 00:22:34,310
which is literally your third eye and
reptiles it as a retina and the cornea in

762
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:35,160
Atlanta,

763
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:38,070
they believe that's what the
evidence on an apparently,

764
00:22:38,071 --> 00:22:39,150
it's like really kind of,

765
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,550
it's hard to figure out exactly.

766
00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:42,870
But they know the body has it.

767
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:45,180
They know it's produced by the
liver and the lungs for sure.

768
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:46,980
And this chemical,

769
00:22:46,981 --> 00:22:50,160
when you get it and you give it to
people that have had UFO abduction

770
00:22:50,161 --> 00:22:50,994
experiences,

771
00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:53,370
it gives them the exact same experience.

772
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:53,970
Um,

773
00:22:53,970 --> 00:22:54,171
it,

774
00:22:54,171 --> 00:22:57,150
it brings them into
contact with other beings.

775
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:01,220
The idea that this is just a
hallucination because you are,

776
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,580
your body has some,

777
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:02,851
uh,

778
00:23:02,851 --> 00:23:03,181
in,

779
00:23:03,181 --> 00:23:08,181
in dodginess chemical in it and its spikes
and stimulates the visual cortex and

780
00:23:08,971 --> 00:23:10,680
what have you and you have this,

781
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:13,830
that is what everyone has always assumed.

782
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:14,341
Uh,

783
00:23:14,341 --> 00:23:17,110
whenever you talk about anything
hallucinatory or Psychedelic,

784
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:18,450
but what they're not,

785
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:23,510
what a lot of people haven't taken into
consideration is that you're basically a

786
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:25,770
conglomeration of chemicals,

787
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,660
your neurotransmitters,

788
00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:28,441
dopamine,

789
00:23:28,441 --> 00:23:29,041
Serotonin,

790
00:23:29,041 --> 00:23:34,041
and there's a million different chemicals
which w as their levels vary up and

791
00:23:34,381 --> 00:23:34,951
down,

792
00:23:34,951 --> 00:23:37,710
it drastically changes your reality,

793
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:39,510
your happiness level,

794
00:23:39,511 --> 00:23:40,560
your appreciation,

795
00:23:40,561 --> 00:23:41,040
love,

796
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:41,940
oxytocin,

797
00:23:41,941 --> 00:23:46,100
all of these things proven
100% change your reality.

798
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:49,550
You change the physical meet
vehicle reality that you have.

799
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:52,490
And I think for whatever reason,

800
00:23:52,491 --> 00:23:54,740
when we think of something in the mind,

801
00:23:54,741 --> 00:23:55,850
when we think of the mind,

802
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:56,241
like you're,

803
00:23:56,241 --> 00:23:59,960
you're saying that coherent thought
can contact other entities from other

804
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:00,501
people.

805
00:24:00,501 --> 00:24:00,651
Like,

806
00:24:00,651 --> 00:24:02,330
what the fuck are you talking about?

807
00:24:02,331 --> 00:24:02,511
You know,

808
00:24:02,511 --> 00:24:04,850
that's like the initial
immediate reaction,

809
00:24:04,851 --> 00:24:05,684
right?

810
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:07,030
Misunder miss,

811
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:08,460
educate about the nature of it.

812
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,140
Well of consciousness,

813
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:10,861
conscious for you.

814
00:24:10,861 --> 00:24:13,920
I've always tried to get people
to try to understand how bizarre.

815
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:15,900
Just just imagination is.

816
00:24:15,901 --> 00:24:19,260
And I don't mean imagination by you're
imagining things that aren't there,

817
00:24:19,410 --> 00:24:20,161
that's not real.

818
00:24:20,161 --> 00:24:20,400
You're,

819
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,420
you're playing games with your mind.

820
00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:24,600
What I mean by imagination is everything,

821
00:24:24,810 --> 00:24:29,310
including the language that
we're speaking with right now,

822
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:33,510
the vehicle in which this language is
getting delivered through the Internet.

823
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:36,210
All of this came from the imagination.

824
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:36,990
Everything.

825
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:38,070
This table came from.

826
00:24:38,071 --> 00:24:40,890
The imagination is the arm
that holds this microphone.

827
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:44,460
Someone thought this shit up and then
all of a sudden it manifested itself in a

828
00:24:44,461 --> 00:24:46,860
physical form when they
actively created it.

829
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:49,200
That seems so normal to us.

830
00:24:49,290 --> 00:24:50,340
It seems so normal,

831
00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:53,670
but we're the only fucking animal in
the world we know that can do that.

832
00:24:54,010 --> 00:24:54,231
Well,

833
00:24:54,231 --> 00:24:54,301
the,

834
00:24:54,301 --> 00:24:55,360
and it goes beyond that because,

835
00:24:55,361 --> 00:24:55,541
you know,

836
00:24:55,541 --> 00:24:59,800
Doctor John at Princeton University
had the Princeton engineering anomalies

837
00:24:59,801 --> 00:25:02,050
research lab and I knew Dr John and,

838
00:25:02,051 --> 00:25:02,710
um,

839
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:06,850
they had proven that you could set up a
random number generator machine and put

840
00:25:06,851 --> 00:25:09,280
your thought towards it and begin to move,

841
00:25:09,281 --> 00:25:11,140
whether it's spitting out zeros or ones.

842
00:25:11,141 --> 00:25:13,210
And that there is in fact,

843
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:14,623
uh,

844
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:19,840
been proven scientifically that the
mind is actually operating non-locally

845
00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:23,530
meaning that it's not limited to
the space and time in a linear way.

846
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:28,860
And these studies that have been done
by Dean Raden and Dr John and many other

847
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:29,670
scientists,

848
00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:30,250
um,

849
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:31,420
with very good credentials.

850
00:25:31,421 --> 00:25:31,631
I mean,

851
00:25:31,631 --> 00:25:33,950
Doctor John was a engineer and,

852
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:34,780
uh,

853
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:35,620
at Princeton,

854
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:40,990
what they found is that in fact the
mind itself is what urban Trojans

855
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:41,520
Schrodinger said.

856
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:45,310
And Urban Schroders or of course was the
father of four a particle wave theory

857
00:25:45,311 --> 00:25:46,210
and quantum mechanics.

858
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:48,310
And I think it was in 1910 or so.

859
00:25:48,311 --> 00:25:51,580
He said the total number of mines
in the universe is one that is,

860
00:25:51,581 --> 00:25:52,870
it's a singularity.

861
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:56,020
And so that understanding is,

862
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:56,550
uh,

863
00:25:56,550 --> 00:25:56,801
I mean,

864
00:25:56,801 --> 00:25:59,950
I know it sounds sort of 'em out there,

865
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:00,850
but,

866
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:01,361
no,

867
00:26:01,361 --> 00:26:02,140
I mean it,

868
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:03,520
it actually sounds very vedic,

869
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:03,990
um,

870
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:04,900
in the sense of,

871
00:26:04,901 --> 00:26:05,231
of,

872
00:26:05,231 --> 00:26:05,591
of the,

873
00:26:05,591 --> 00:26:07,210
of Buddhist or of Vedanta.

874
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:08,630
But it'd be too,

875
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:10,150
I mean,

876
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:11,650
I guess to maybe Sarah Palin,

877
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:12,320
but,

878
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,100
um,

879
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:13,631
I say that,

880
00:26:13,631 --> 00:26:14,021
I'm sorry,

881
00:26:14,021 --> 00:26:14,854
I apologize.

882
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:15,580
Um,

883
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:19,150
but the reason I'm late
is the world isn't flat.

884
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:20,140
Um,

885
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:23,890
and there's a whole area of physics and
science that has been drilled down on

886
00:26:23,891 --> 00:26:26,380
for years that establish
all these things is true.

887
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:30,910
It isn't talked about because I'm the
high priests of religion and the high

888
00:26:30,911 --> 00:26:34,570
priests of science are all opposed
to this information coming out.

889
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:35,880
So the idea though,

890
00:26:35,890 --> 00:26:40,540
part of the secrecy around this whole
Ufo issue isn't just the physical energy

891
00:26:40,541 --> 00:26:41,770
and propulsion systems.

892
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:43,090
It's the paradigm.

893
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:44,290
Because if you be,

894
00:26:44,650 --> 00:26:45,760
if you asked the question,

895
00:26:45,761 --> 00:26:46,260
I'm back.

896
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:46,900
Yeah.

897
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:49,840
Going back to this dinner with
the CIA director and his wife,

898
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:51,640
very smart lady,

899
00:26:52,990 --> 00:26:53,860
and she turns in,

900
00:26:53,861 --> 00:26:55,450
we're sitting across
the table having dinner.

901
00:26:55,451 --> 00:26:55,601
I mean,

902
00:26:55,601 --> 00:26:58,960
that was the cover story was
it was a dinner and she says,

903
00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:03,190
how are they communicating
across the vastness of space?

904
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:06,040
And of course I had the,

905
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:06,851
you know,

906
00:27:06,851 --> 00:27:09,280
I didn't know whether to tell her
something that sounded scientific,

907
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:14,820
so I maintain my credibility or to tell
her the truth and risk losing all my

908
00:27:15,221 --> 00:27:16,054
credibility.

909
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:20,800
But I decided then in the early days
of this project that if someone smart

910
00:27:20,801 --> 00:27:22,060
enough to ask the question,

911
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:24,010
I'm going to answer it honestly,

912
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:25,840
even though it's going to blow their mind.

913
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:28,710
And so I looked at her and her husband,

914
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:29,950
the CIA director sitting next to it,

915
00:27:29,951 --> 00:27:30,090
right?

916
00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:31,630
It didn't really understand
where she was going.

917
00:27:31,631 --> 00:27:31,931
And I said,

918
00:27:31,931 --> 00:27:32,764
look,

919
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:34,240
take her Milky Way.

920
00:27:34,930 --> 00:27:36,670
It's a hundred thousand
light years across.

921
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:37,900
All right?

922
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:40,120
So that in a hundred thousand
light years as a distance,

923
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:45,360
that's how far you would go at 186,000
miles a second for a hundred thousand

924
00:27:48,010 --> 00:27:49,390
years going at that speed.

925
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,920
Then that's just our own galaxy.

926
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,800
Now you take 1% of that,

927
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:58,950
say a thousand light years at the speed
of your cell phone or radio wave or TV

928
00:27:59,231 --> 00:27:59,531
waiver.

929
00:27:59,531 --> 00:28:04,180
This system we're using right here for
someone from a star system 1% of the way

930
00:28:04,181 --> 00:28:06,430
through our galaxy for them to say,

931
00:28:06,431 --> 00:28:06,791
hello,

932
00:28:06,791 --> 00:28:07,624
how are you?

933
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:10,600
And for a spacecraft that's
at another star system,

934
00:28:10,601 --> 00:28:11,560
a thousand light years away,

935
00:28:11,561 --> 00:28:13,000
see here earth to say fine,

936
00:28:13,001 --> 00:28:13,834
how are you doing?

937
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,490
That just took how long?

938
00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:16,390
4,000 years.

939
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:17,260
2000 years.

940
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:19,210
1001 way in 1000 and other.

941
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,980
So at the time since the birth of Christ,

942
00:28:20,981 --> 00:28:22,990
so the speed of light is too damn slow.

943
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:24,340
And so when you,

944
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:28,660
when you begin to go through what
I call the crossing point of light,

945
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:31,150
it's like the sound
barrier was a big deal.

946
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:33,580
The biggest deal is the light barrier.

947
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:35,620
And when you go past the light barrier,

948
00:28:35,621 --> 00:28:39,400
you're going to cross into these and
kind of multifaceted resonant dimensions,

949
00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:43,450
part of which hook into the
singularity of mind and thought.

950
00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:46,180
And actually this film
that we're working on,

951
00:28:46,181 --> 00:28:49,300
which is the largest crowd
funded documentary in history,

952
00:28:49,301 --> 00:28:50,020
to my knowledge,

953
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:50,853
a serious,

954
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,260
and you can find out about it,

955
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:55,390
serious disclosure.com it's
been crowdfunded by the public.

956
00:28:55,391 --> 00:28:57,190
It's all been funded by people out there,

957
00:28:57,191 --> 00:28:58,120
thousands of people.

958
00:28:58,650 --> 00:28:58,901
Um,

959
00:28:58,901 --> 00:28:59,650
we're gonna do a,

960
00:28:59,650 --> 00:29:00,040
um,

961
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:00,161
oh,

962
00:29:00,161 --> 00:29:00,731
we're going to do a,

963
00:29:00,731 --> 00:29:01,564
um,

964
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:05,320
premiere here in La on April
22nd if you want to come.

965
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:06,483
But I would love to,

966
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:06,791
okay,

967
00:29:06,791 --> 00:29:07,350
come.

968
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:08,940
We can't send things
to the speed of light.

969
00:29:08,941 --> 00:29:09,121
Right.

970
00:29:09,121 --> 00:29:09,490
And even,

971
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:10,140
even that,

972
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:12,450
even saying that beyond
the speed of light,

973
00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:13,560
but they can't do that,

974
00:29:13,561 --> 00:29:13,920
right?

975
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:14,590
I mean there's,

976
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:16,180
you can't send information in,

977
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:17,250
in a form of light yet,

978
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,113
can you

979
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:18,891
not?

980
00:29:18,891 --> 00:29:19,280
Well,

981
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:19,641
no,

982
00:29:19,641 --> 00:29:20,391
but I'm well,

983
00:29:20,391 --> 00:29:22,100
fiber optics and things of this sort.

984
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,420
But does that move at the speed of light?

985
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:23,990
Pretty much.

986
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:24,250
Yeah,

987
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:24,520
but,

988
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:24,830
but,

989
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:27,350
but what I'm saying is that if
you go beyond the speed of light,

990
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:27,680
right,

991
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,210
it's a whole new physics of course.

992
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:29,720
Okay.

993
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:30,770
So that's what if,

994
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:32,990
if these craft are here and now we have,

995
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,510
I have over 4,000 cases
where they've landed.

996
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:36,380
And we have evidence.

997
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:39,530
I have 3,500 pilot cases.

998
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:42,180
We have over 500 whistle blowers,

999
00:29:42,181 --> 00:29:44,100
top secret military corporate people.

1000
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:46,530
And I have 110 of them
on digital video tape,

1001
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:48,030
although nobody wants to see it.

1002
00:29:48,031 --> 00:29:48,630
But I have it.

1003
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:49,560
So the question is,

1004
00:29:49,561 --> 00:29:50,400
if they're here,

1005
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:51,810
how the hell they get here,

1006
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:56,190
or they're not using an Exxon jet a fuel
and they're not using a solid rocket

1007
00:29:56,191 --> 00:29:59,430
booster and the not using an
eye on drive or anything linear.

1008
00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:01,530
So you have to begin
to have this question.

1009
00:30:01,531 --> 00:30:03,720
So when the CIA director's
wife asked me this,

1010
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:08,700
I told her about that
they had technologies that
interface with thought and

1011
00:30:08,701 --> 00:30:09,534
consciousness.

1012
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:10,590
And that sounded,

1013
00:30:10,591 --> 00:30:12,600
it's Biz may sound as
bizarre to people now,

1014
00:30:12,601 --> 00:30:15,120
but if you took your cell phone
and show Thomas Jefferson,

1015
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:16,860
your smartphone,

1016
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:17,790
um,

1017
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:18,780
they would think it was magic.

1018
00:30:18,781 --> 00:30:19,650
If you went to Salem,

1019
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:21,180
Massachusetts couple hundred years ago,

1020
00:30:21,181 --> 00:30:22,590
you'd be burned at the stake as a witch.

1021
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:23,880
So the point is,

1022
00:30:23,881 --> 00:30:27,810
is that people have to have some humility
about the fact that humans are one

1023
00:30:27,811 --> 00:30:29,490
half of one step out of the jungle.

1024
00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:30,510
Technologically.

1025
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:34,230
And we're only a hundred or so years
into anything resembling real technology.

1026
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:38,490
So when we're dealing with civilizations
that are attended the six to 10 to the

1027
00:30:38,491 --> 00:30:41,040
seventh 100,000 to a
million years ahead of us,

1028
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:44,550
we have to have some humility
about what that might look like.

1029
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:47,910
And so when I explained this
to the wife to say I director,

1030
00:30:47,911 --> 00:30:49,140
she just looked at me and said,

1031
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:51,630
I thought it had to be
something like that.

1032
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:52,171
I mean,

1033
00:30:52,171 --> 00:30:54,150
people are ready to
actually understand this.

1034
00:30:54,151 --> 00:30:56,850
Not everyone has to be retarded on this.

1035
00:30:56,851 --> 00:30:58,290
And I tell folks that it's,

1036
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:03,830
what's a shame in my mind is that our
civilization has been exploring these sort

1037
00:31:04,201 --> 00:31:07,710
of what they called border land
sciences for a hundred years.

1038
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:11,220
And it's all been kept very
secret or debunked or ridiculed.

1039
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:15,270
And it's actually holding us back
not only socially and spiritually,

1040
00:31:15,570 --> 00:31:17,730
but environmentally
and in every other way.

1041
00:31:17,731 --> 00:31:22,560
Because this nexus of where you have
these advanced trans dimensional physics

1042
00:31:22,561 --> 00:31:23,394
come together.

1043
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:27,300
That's how you're propelling through
one point in space to another across

1044
00:31:27,301 --> 00:31:28,134
galaxies.

1045
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:31,830
It's also how we're going to be able
to run this planet's energy grid.

1046
00:31:32,310 --> 00:31:32,551
Uh,

1047
00:31:32,551 --> 00:31:36,450
without a grid where every home business
and car can pull energy out of the

1048
00:31:36,451 --> 00:31:39,420
fabric of space time through
this kind of physics.

1049
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:44,550
And so there's this nexus
where electromagnetism and
trans dimensional physics

1050
00:31:44,551 --> 00:31:47,550
comes together and then you cross it a
little deeper and that's where you get

1051
00:31:47,551 --> 00:31:48,990
into the science of consciousness.

1052
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:50,910
And this becomes a very,

1053
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:54,510
very complex issue for most
people because it's new to them.

1054
00:31:54,810 --> 00:31:57,480
But once you understand the
fundamental science behind it,

1055
00:31:57,481 --> 00:31:58,770
it's really very simple.

1056
00:31:59,570 --> 00:32:04,570
What we need to understand is that no
one 200 years ago even thought of a

1057
00:32:05,361 --> 00:32:06,194
camera,

1058
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:07,220
right?

1059
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:08,150
200 years ago,

1060
00:32:08,151 --> 00:32:09,290
when you want to picture something,

1061
00:32:09,291 --> 00:32:11,000
you had to draw it and there was,

1062
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:11,870
you know,

1063
00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:12,980
the idea of a camera was,

1064
00:32:12,981 --> 00:32:14,600
so the idea of a movie,

1065
00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:18,740
the idea of sending a video
on your phone to your friend,

1066
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:22,220
you could take a video of you here right
now and send it to a friend and they

1067
00:32:22,221 --> 00:32:23,480
would get it almost instantly.

1068
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:25,780
That's just a tiny blip in,

1069
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,320
in human history,

1070
00:32:27,321 --> 00:32:31,820
a 200 year blip in human history from
riding horses to sending video through the

1071
00:32:31,821 --> 00:32:32,260
Internet.

1072
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:32,991
Or a hundred years.

1073
00:32:32,991 --> 00:32:33,824
Yeah.

1074
00:32:34,010 --> 00:32:37,760
And the people that existed back
then would have never seen a calming.

1075
00:32:37,970 --> 00:32:39,720
And if technology,

1076
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:40,651
and we know it does,

1077
00:32:40,651 --> 00:32:43,920
accelerates exponentially what we're
dealing with a thousand years from now,

1078
00:32:43,921 --> 00:32:45,060
10,000 years from now,

1079
00:32:45,210 --> 00:32:47,100
it's completely unrecognizable.

1080
00:32:47,490 --> 00:32:51,390
We live in an area where our
solar system is kind of scary.

1081
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:54,780
There's a lot of rocks out there and
they fly around and occasionally slamming

1082
00:32:54,781 --> 00:32:55,650
the shit and they can,

1083
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:58,080
they can ruin civilization
for a little bit.

1084
00:32:58,530 --> 00:33:00,120
But there might be solar
systems out there would,

1085
00:33:00,121 --> 00:33:01,140
that doesn't take place.

1086
00:33:01,290 --> 00:33:05,700
There could be a civilization that
develops to 3 billion years ago.

1087
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:05,941
I mean,

1088
00:33:05,941 --> 00:33:06,840
we really don't know.

1089
00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:07,703
We have no idea.

1090
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:08,151
Well,

1091
00:33:08,151 --> 00:33:11,330
the earth has had life or 700 million
years and all scientists recognize,

1092
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:15,740
recognize that except people who think
that the world was made 6,000 years ago.

1093
00:33:16,010 --> 00:33:19,130
And I have nothing to say to those
folks except to say get over it.

1094
00:33:19,490 --> 00:33:19,970
Um,

1095
00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:20,980
but uh,

1096
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,033
I know I'm just,

1097
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:23,300
I'm an outrageous person.

1098
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:24,480
You are a little outdated.

1099
00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:24,951
A little bit,

1100
00:33:24,951 --> 00:33:25,880
a little bit outrageous.

1101
00:33:25,881 --> 00:33:26,714
Haven't heard anything yet.

1102
00:33:27,490 --> 00:33:27,771
Yeah,

1103
00:33:27,771 --> 00:33:28,220
I'm ready.

1104
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:29,240
I'm already strapped in,

1105
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:30,021
so,

1106
00:33:30,021 --> 00:33:30,350
uh,

1107
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:30,781
but it,

1108
00:33:30,781 --> 00:33:33,840
but if you really look at our,

1109
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,360
our technological development,

1110
00:33:35,361 --> 00:33:35,481
you know,

1111
00:33:35,481 --> 00:33:40,280
my grandmother was born in
post reconstruction south
in the late 18 hundreds her

1112
00:33:40,281 --> 00:33:42,560
son worked on the lunar module,

1113
00:33:42,561 --> 00:33:43,670
put the first man on the moon.

1114
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:48,800
But by the time we landed on the moon
in 1969 we were 15 years into having

1115
00:33:48,801 --> 00:33:51,350
classified antigravity propulsion devices.

1116
00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:55,830
The biggest mind fuck that I was trying
to drop on people with time is between

1117
00:33:55,831 --> 00:33:57,600
the invention of the airplane.

1118
00:33:57,810 --> 00:33:59,460
It was less than 50 years.

1119
00:33:59,461 --> 00:34:01,980
It's someone used that airplane
to drop a nuclear weapon.

1120
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:03,050
Right.

1121
00:34:03,050 --> 00:34:03,800
And see this is,

1122
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:04,670
this is pretty crazy.

1123
00:34:04,671 --> 00:34:07,250
It gets into the whole question
I've had a lot of people ask me.

1124
00:34:07,251 --> 00:34:08,084
We have a,

1125
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:10,460
if you go to our sites,

1126
00:34:10,461 --> 00:34:13,940
serious disclosure.com there's a section
that has all these top secret military

1127
00:34:13,941 --> 00:34:14,774
guys on it.

1128
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:17,510
And part of it is that we,

1129
00:34:17,610 --> 00:34:18,730
there's a whole grouping of them.

1130
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:22,010
Have a dozen of them or so who were at
strategic air command facilities and

1131
00:34:22,011 --> 00:34:25,940
nuclear weapons storage areas and
processing areas and all this stuff.

1132
00:34:26,090 --> 00:34:30,350
And every one of them were overflown
by 80 spacecraft back in the forties

1133
00:34:30,351 --> 00:34:34,160
fifties sixties because they were very
concerned about what we were doing

1134
00:34:34,370 --> 00:34:39,370
because we were going from having
these technologies to weaponizing them.

1135
00:34:40,130 --> 00:34:44,960
And our technological development had
gotten ahead of our social and spiritual

1136
00:34:44,961 --> 00:34:46,340
development way ahead.

1137
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:46,821
And this,

1138
00:34:46,821 --> 00:34:48,440
this is an existential threat,

1139
00:34:48,441 --> 00:34:49,131
but you know,

1140
00:34:49,131 --> 00:34:50,240
as an emergency doctor,

1141
00:34:50,241 --> 00:34:50,720
I used to have,

1142
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:51,260
you know,

1143
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:54,200
crazy people come into the er
and I'd have to commit them.

1144
00:34:54,350 --> 00:34:54,801
And you know,

1145
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:56,720
it's dangerous to yourself or others.

1146
00:34:57,140 --> 00:34:57,740
And,

1147
00:34:57,740 --> 00:35:01,670
and what I've found is that if you just
take a step back and look at humanity

1148
00:35:01,671 --> 00:35:03,770
through the eyes of
extraterrestrial civilizations,

1149
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:05,900
we've become dangerous to ourselves,

1150
00:35:05,930 --> 00:35:07,460
but we're also dangerous to others.

1151
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:12,380
And moreover we become a existential
threat to the biosphere of the earth where

1152
00:35:12,381 --> 00:35:13,220
we're killing the oceans,

1153
00:35:13,221 --> 00:35:14,510
the atmosphere and everything else.

1154
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:16,250
All this is unnecessary.

1155
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:18,050
So the question is,

1156
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:22,460
the misanthropic sociopaths that are
running the planet into the ground are

1157
00:35:22,461 --> 00:35:26,660
going to have to be stood down by
the people getting behind disclosure,

1158
00:35:26,690 --> 00:35:29,360
getting behind the technologies
and basically saying,

1159
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,111
we're not,

1160
00:35:30,111 --> 00:35:32,090
we're fed up and we're not going
to put up with this anymore.

1161
00:35:32,091 --> 00:35:33,110
It's like the movie network.

1162
00:35:33,470 --> 00:35:34,130
Um,

1163
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:36,230
and we're mad as hell and I think people,

1164
00:35:36,231 --> 00:35:37,890
and it isn't about doing anything violent,

1165
00:35:37,891 --> 00:35:38,010
it's

1166
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:41,940
about saying we need to just move forward
because Washington isn't going to do

1167
00:35:41,941 --> 00:35:42,390
it.

1168
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:43,230
My uncle's company,

1169
00:35:43,231 --> 00:35:45,930
Northrop Grumman isn't Lockheed
Martin isn't going to do it.

1170
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:50,250
It's you and me and the other people
out there who get the situation we're in

1171
00:35:50,251 --> 00:35:50,910
and wanting to fix it.

1172
00:35:50,910 --> 00:35:54,400
One of the things that might have also
got their attention was a operation

1173
00:35:54,401 --> 00:35:55,530
starfish prime.

1174
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:59,460
You aware of that from 1962 where they
launched a nuclear bomb in a space,

1175
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:02,320
blew up a nuclear bomb and space.

1176
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:02,880
Well,

1177
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,140
actually one of our witnesses,

1178
00:36:04,141 --> 00:36:04,980
Colonel Diedricksen,

1179
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:08,860
was with the atomic energy commission,

1180
00:36:08,930 --> 00:36:13,660
which became the doe and he was a air
force colonel and his responsibility was

1181
00:36:13,661 --> 00:36:14,890
overall the nuclear facilities.

1182
00:36:14,891 --> 00:36:19,750
But he knew of a program where we were
going to lob a thermonuclear weapon and

1183
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,930
detonate it on the moon and when that,

1184
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:22,391
okay.

1185
00:36:22,391 --> 00:36:25,930
And they actually worked on this
and when it went XO atmospheric,

1186
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,510
when it left our atmosphere and,

1187
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:31,500
and it was intercepted by an expert
trestle vehicle and basically the

1188
00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:35,340
materialized was taken out and he knew
had personal knowledge of this so,

1189
00:36:35,370 --> 00:36:37,390
so they can actually tried to do this.

1190
00:36:37,391 --> 00:36:39,910
They actually launched it and
it was on its way to the moon.

1191
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:40,421
Um,

1192
00:36:40,421 --> 00:36:41,254
so,

1193
00:36:41,290 --> 00:36:41,740
um,

1194
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:41,951
you know,

1195
00:36:41,951 --> 00:36:43,990
there've been a lot of really creepy,

1196
00:36:43,991 --> 00:36:46,270
it's like doctor strange love on steroids,

1197
00:36:46,330 --> 00:36:46,750
um,

1198
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:48,820
with some of these guys and you know,

1199
00:36:48,821 --> 00:36:49,370
um,

1200
00:36:49,370 --> 00:36:53,170
I still work with a lot of folks who are
with the agency and aerospace industry

1201
00:36:53,171 --> 00:36:57,290
and there's a term at the naval
research labs and CIA for,

1202
00:36:57,291 --> 00:36:58,870
for this whole area of science.

1203
00:36:58,871 --> 00:37:00,700
And it's called W s f.

1204
00:37:00,790 --> 00:37:02,050
M it stands for,

1205
00:37:02,051 --> 00:37:03,280
it's not a radio station by the way.

1206
00:37:03,610 --> 00:37:05,980
It stands for weird
science and fricking magic.

1207
00:37:06,730 --> 00:37:07,630
And that's what they call it.

1208
00:37:07,631 --> 00:37:08,231
And it's grown,

1209
00:37:08,231 --> 00:37:08,471
man.

1210
00:37:08,471 --> 00:37:09,590
Just never used the word frigging.

1211
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:10,300
Yeah,

1212
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:10,751
I don't,

1213
00:37:10,751 --> 00:37:11,680
this is what they call it.

1214
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:12,750
They need to be stopped.

1215
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:16,030
And they have that access to technology
and they're using the word frickin that

1216
00:37:16,050 --> 00:37:16,930
you can be trusted them.

1217
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:17,591
Oh,

1218
00:37:17,591 --> 00:37:18,170
you can't,

1219
00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:18,371
they're,

1220
00:37:18,371 --> 00:37:19,031
they're held back.

1221
00:37:19,031 --> 00:37:19,361
Actually,

1222
00:37:19,361 --> 00:37:20,140
I'll tell you,

1223
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:23,680
a lot of them are really good people
who want to see the secrecy end,

1224
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:26,080
but there's not much they can do
as an individual when you're in a

1225
00:37:26,081 --> 00:37:27,910
compartmentalized sort of a system.

1226
00:37:27,911 --> 00:37:28,140
Like,

1227
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:28,330
well,

1228
00:37:28,330 --> 00:37:29,380
I got a lot of them come forward.

1229
00:37:29,381 --> 00:37:29,430
Lord,

1230
00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:29,581
you know,

1231
00:37:29,581 --> 00:37:29,791
every,

1232
00:37:29,791 --> 00:37:32,690
almost all of our top secret
guys had signed security owes.

1233
00:37:33,010 --> 00:37:33,450
But here,

1234
00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:34,740
here's something I want everyone done.

1235
00:37:34,930 --> 00:37:35,763
Listen carefully.

1236
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:36,481
Daniel,

1237
00:37:36,481 --> 00:37:41,220
she hand who is accustomed constitutional
attorney who did Pentagon papers and,

1238
00:37:41,221 --> 00:37:41,530
and,

1239
00:37:41,530 --> 00:37:43,280
and Silkwood case in all this.

1240
00:37:44,070 --> 00:37:46,200
He and I ran this by him.

1241
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:46,861
I said,

1242
00:37:46,861 --> 00:37:47,694
look,

1243
00:37:47,970 --> 00:37:49,350
I've done briefings for,

1244
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:50,580
here's a short list.

1245
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:53,190
The director of Central Intelligence,

1246
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:55,470
the head of the defense
intelligence agency,

1247
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:57,630
members of the Senate
Intelligence Committee,

1248
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:58,740
uh,

1249
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:00,600
senior people who are on the house.

1250
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:01,500
Uh,

1251
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:02,670
various health committees,

1252
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,140
government oversight committee,

1253
00:38:04,830 --> 00:38:05,370
um,

1254
00:38:05,370 --> 00:38:06,930
presidential staff,

1255
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:07,830
uh,

1256
00:38:07,830 --> 00:38:10,350
the head of intelligence for
the joint chiefs of Staff,

1257
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:12,360
what's called j two personally,

1258
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:15,680
I took astronaut Edgar Mitchell
to one of those briefings for the,

1259
00:38:15,681 --> 00:38:16,514
for the admiral,

1260
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:17,490
Admiral Tom Wilson.

1261
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:18,311
And,

1262
00:38:18,311 --> 00:38:23,311
and every one of these people had been
inquiring about this issue and had been

1263
00:38:24,031 --> 00:38:25,020
denied access.

1264
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:27,330
One of them who I will not name,

1265
00:38:28,050 --> 00:38:28,530
uh,

1266
00:38:28,530 --> 00:38:30,810
I learned for my briefing with him.

1267
00:38:31,530 --> 00:38:34,730
I had given a document that's
going to be in this film,

1268
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:35,550
serious.

1269
00:38:35,550 --> 00:38:36,950
And the document isn't it?

1270
00:38:36,970 --> 00:38:38,250
It's on the front of the thing.

1271
00:38:38,251 --> 00:38:40,110
That briefing I put together
for President Obama.

1272
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:43,540
And if you go down the list when you
put together a briefing for President

1273
00:38:43,541 --> 00:38:44,374
Obama,

1274
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:44,860
yeah.

1275
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:44,981
It,

1276
00:38:44,981 --> 00:38:45,814
we asked you to

1277
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:49,550
someone senior involved with his team did.

1278
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:50,630
Um,

1279
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:52,310
and so Jesus Christ,

1280
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:53,210
okay.

1281
00:38:53,210 --> 00:38:53,730
Yeah.

1282
00:38:53,730 --> 00:38:53,991
Weird.

1283
00:38:53,991 --> 00:38:56,690
Must that be to be the president
and then to get in there and go,

1284
00:38:56,691 --> 00:38:56,931
okay,

1285
00:38:56,931 --> 00:39:00,200
what the fuck is going on with
the emperor has no clothes.

1286
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:00,470
Hey,

1287
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:01,760
call that that doctor,

1288
00:39:02,210 --> 00:39:03,050
what's that guy's name?

1289
00:39:03,290 --> 00:39:03,741
Virginia.

1290
00:39:03,741 --> 00:39:04,574
Dr. Greer,

1291
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:05,450
go get that guy.

1292
00:39:05,450 --> 00:39:06,283
Yeah.

1293
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:06,680
So,

1294
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:06,831
no,

1295
00:39:06,831 --> 00:39:08,030
but what happened is that,

1296
00:39:08,090 --> 00:39:08,360
uh,

1297
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:08,630
when,

1298
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:09,110
when,

1299
00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:09,501
when he,

1300
00:39:09,501 --> 00:39:10,420
this admiral looked at

1301
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:14,050
this document and it's gonna blow
people's mind when they see this,

1302
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:15,180
uh,

1303
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:19,840
it's a national reconnaissance office
document in our OE does all the top secret

1304
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,660
spy satellites and over
their headquarters,

1305
00:39:22,661 --> 00:39:24,010
it says we own the night

1306
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,740
and the,

1307
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:26,821
Oh yeah,

1308
00:39:26,821 --> 00:39:27,690
that's their motto.

1309
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:28,560
We own the night.

1310
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:29,473
It's pretty,

1311
00:39:29,730 --> 00:39:30,071
yeah,

1312
00:39:30,071 --> 00:39:30,960
it's a pretty spooky.

1313
00:39:30,961 --> 00:39:31,410
Yeah.

1314
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:32,131
But so,

1315
00:39:32,131 --> 00:39:32,321
you know,

1316
00:39:32,321 --> 00:39:34,110
these are the kind of dudes
I work with all the time.

1317
00:39:34,610 --> 00:39:38,250
What happened is that the
one of these compartments,

1318
00:39:38,251 --> 00:39:39,080
it has a whole district

1319
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:39,721
Bhushan lists,

1320
00:39:39,721 --> 00:39:40,790
cosmic ops,

1321
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,050
magic ops,

1322
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:42,771
Dadadadada,

1323
00:39:42,771 --> 00:39:43,050
Dah,

1324
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:43,610
Dah,

1325
00:39:43,610 --> 00:39:44,180
um,

1326
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:44,720
you know,

1327
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:45,553
uh,

1328
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:47,510
all kinds of insights about 20 of them.

1329
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:50,790
And this is a document
that was not declassified,

1330
00:39:50,791 --> 00:39:54,410
that was given to me by a
source that I won't talk about.

1331
00:39:54,830 --> 00:39:57,830
And this admiral recognize
one of those compartments.

1332
00:39:57,831 --> 00:40:02,260
So he contacted them and on the
other end of the phone they said,

1333
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:02,631
he said,

1334
00:40:02,631 --> 00:40:03,090
look,

1335
00:40:03,090 --> 00:40:04,640
I'm so and so.

1336
00:40:04,641 --> 00:40:04,971
And they said,

1337
00:40:04,971 --> 00:40:05,151
yes,

1338
00:40:05,151 --> 00:40:05,271
sir,

1339
00:40:05,271 --> 00:40:06,140
we know who you are.

1340
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:07,311
And he says,

1341
00:40:07,311 --> 00:40:07,431
well,

1342
00:40:07,431 --> 00:40:08,870
I want to be read into,

1343
00:40:08,871 --> 00:40:12,020
which is military speak for
briefed on this project.

1344
00:40:12,530 --> 00:40:13,071
And they said,

1345
00:40:13,071 --> 00:40:13,490
sir,

1346
00:40:13,490 --> 00:40:15,140
we cannot discuss this project with you.

1347
00:40:15,170 --> 00:40:16,100
You don't have a need to know.

1348
00:40:16,101 --> 00:40:16,401
He says,

1349
00:40:16,401 --> 00:40:19,910
what do you mean I'm the
head of intelligence for
the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

1350
00:40:19,911 --> 00:40:21,320
How can I not have a need to know?

1351
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:22,401
And they said,

1352
00:40:22,401 --> 00:40:22,641
sir,

1353
00:40:22,641 --> 00:40:24,350
we will not discuss this with you.

1354
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:25,820
Blocked him.

1355
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:29,660
So who the fuck knows who's who's
like how many people are there?

1356
00:40:29,690 --> 00:40:30,020
The,

1357
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:31,250
have you determined that the,

1358
00:40:31,251 --> 00:40:31,660
yeah,

1359
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:32,160
I have,

1360
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:32,550
um,

1361
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:33,870
I know some of the members of,

1362
00:40:34,030 --> 00:40:34,570
of the,

1363
00:40:34,570 --> 00:40:34,721
of,

1364
00:40:34,721 --> 00:40:37,900
there's a committee
and it's transnational.

1365
00:40:38,170 --> 00:40:38,960
Um,

1366
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:39,300
it,

1367
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:44,080
it started out much smaller and less
opaque back in the forties when Truman was

1368
00:40:44,081 --> 00:40:45,220
around have a name.

1369
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,990
It did have the name majestic.

1370
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:47,471
Um,

1371
00:40:47,471 --> 00:40:48,520
and that is not a myth.

1372
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:49,383
Um,

1373
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:51,280
and so even just 12,

1374
00:40:51,281 --> 00:40:51,521
right?

1375
00:40:51,521 --> 00:40:52,031
Is that what it was?

1376
00:40:52,031 --> 00:40:52,300
Yes.

1377
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:52,631
But,

1378
00:40:52,631 --> 00:40:52,900
uh,

1379
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:53,061
the,

1380
00:40:53,061 --> 00:40:55,210
the document as of the
nineties that I got,

1381
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:57,940
it's still had magic Maj I see on it.

1382
00:40:58,690 --> 00:40:59,260
Um,

1383
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:01,240
and so a lot of these programs,

1384
00:41:01,241 --> 00:41:01,481
you know,

1385
00:41:01,481 --> 00:41:04,330
they've gone through
multiple generations of,

1386
00:41:04,350 --> 00:41:05,350
of evolution.

1387
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:08,560
And now I understand it's a
committee of two or 300 folks,

1388
00:41:08,890 --> 00:41:09,490
um,

1389
00:41:09,490 --> 00:41:10,180
who are,

1390
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:10,390
you know,

1391
00:41:10,390 --> 00:41:11,223
corporate,

1392
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:14,290
very deep kind of shadow
government operations.

1393
00:41:14,530 --> 00:41:17,680
And the mistake the public makes is that
they think that just because you're the

1394
00:41:17,681 --> 00:41:20,980
president or the CIA director or member
of the Senate intelligence committee,

1395
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:22,450
you're going to have access to those.

1396
00:41:22,451 --> 00:41:27,370
And that's because they do not understand
what Rumsfeld said is true on the day

1397
00:41:27,370 --> 00:41:28,090
before nine 11.

1398
00:41:28,090 --> 00:41:32,650
And there's going to be in the film where
he said there's two point $3 trillion,

1399
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:34,040
basically missing that we can

1400
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:37,670
account for how the Department of
Defense budget over the last few years,

1401
00:41:37,671 --> 00:41:38,720
two point 3 trillion,

1402
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:39,733
not billion.

1403
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:41,780
Now we found out,

1404
00:41:41,810 --> 00:41:42,170
uh,

1405
00:41:42,170 --> 00:41:44,450
and I discovered this
in the early nineties,

1406
00:41:44,451 --> 00:41:47,240
that there's somewhere between a
hundred and 200 billion a year,

1407
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:48,710
basically just being stolen,

1408
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,480
going into these illegal projects.

1409
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,190
And so when she had an,

1410
00:41:52,191 --> 00:41:52,971
I looked at this,

1411
00:41:52,971 --> 00:41:53,804
this attorney,

1412
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:54,141
I said,

1413
00:41:54,141 --> 00:41:54,710
look,

1414
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:58,640
if all these people who have a need
to know in the constitutional chain of

1415
00:41:58,641 --> 00:42:01,850
command or being lied to
to see and what have you,

1416
00:42:02,390 --> 00:42:04,460
I'm going to declare all those projects,

1417
00:42:04,550 --> 00:42:05,690
rogue op,

1418
00:42:05,691 --> 00:42:07,040
priori illegal.

1419
00:42:07,310 --> 00:42:09,560
Therefore anyone who signed a security,

1420
00:42:09,561 --> 00:42:10,394
as for them,

1421
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:13,160
I'm going to unilaterally announced
that they're released from them.

1422
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:14,750
So all of you listening,

1423
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:17,330
if you've been in any of
these projects with Lockheed,

1424
00:42:17,570 --> 00:42:19,430
Northrup sic,

1425
00:42:19,610 --> 00:42:20,510
the CIA,

1426
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:25,220
you do not have to go by the secrecy
because if they are denying access to the

1427
00:42:25,221 --> 00:42:27,530
people who are in the
constitutional chain of command,

1428
00:42:27,531 --> 00:42:29,720
which I can prove they
have in a court of law,

1429
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:34,040
those projects are rogue and
therefore those security owes have no

1430
00:42:34,041 --> 00:42:35,060
enforceability.

1431
00:42:35,270 --> 00:42:35,541
Now,

1432
00:42:35,541 --> 00:42:38,840
whether or not you have the courage
to come forward is another question,

1433
00:42:39,170 --> 00:42:40,100
but what,

1434
00:42:40,101 --> 00:42:44,930
what I was very glad to be able to do
between the early nineties and 2001 with

1435
00:42:44,931 --> 00:42:49,220
the disclosure project is to pull together
the people who did have the courage

1436
00:42:49,250 --> 00:42:50,480
and they're still coming forward.

1437
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:53,960
When we have people contact me all
the time who are in these projects,

1438
00:42:53,961 --> 00:42:55,850
who give us information intelligence,

1439
00:42:56,210 --> 00:42:57,043
um,

1440
00:42:57,470 --> 00:42:59,150
and it's really a citizen's effort.

1441
00:42:59,151 --> 00:43:01,310
I mean I've never been in the
government in my entire life,

1442
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:02,140
but uh,

1443
00:43:02,140 --> 00:43:06,770
I think this is what you have an idea
and if the idea to picks up steam and

1444
00:43:06,771 --> 00:43:08,540
people see the reason for it.

1445
00:43:08,690 --> 00:43:10,610
But the other thing is to do it in a,

1446
00:43:11,070 --> 00:43:12,740
in a way where people feel supported.

1447
00:43:13,010 --> 00:43:15,890
And that's why we did this in
a way where there were dozens.

1448
00:43:15,891 --> 00:43:16,850
It came out at once.

1449
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:17,960
I mean,

1450
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:20,630
I think in the initial batch
of people came forward,

1451
00:43:20,631 --> 00:43:21,880
it was about 71

1452
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:26,020
of the things I always want to get into
people's heads when they start talking

1453
00:43:26,021 --> 00:43:30,670
about the government or the
people in charge or you know,

1454
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:31,930
those in the know,

1455
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:35,740
the idea that they're
exchanging information is,

1456
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:38,050
is been proven false time and time again.

1457
00:43:38,410 --> 00:43:39,370
Not only that,

1458
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:42,550
what's really blown me away
lately is finding out that,

1459
00:43:42,551 --> 00:43:44,200
especially in this,

1460
00:43:44,230 --> 00:43:46,270
suppose that patriotic time of war,

1461
00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:50,620
we have government factions that
don't like other government factions.

1462
00:43:50,621 --> 00:43:51,460
It's always been that way.

1463
00:43:51,550 --> 00:43:56,550
I was blown away when
Petraeus was outed by the FBI.

1464
00:43:56,710 --> 00:43:57,161
I'd be like,

1465
00:43:57,161 --> 00:43:58,750
are you fucking crazy?

1466
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:00,520
That is nuts.

1467
00:44:00,521 --> 00:44:00,820
You're,

1468
00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:05,820
you're talking about the head of the
CIA and the FBI spying on him over in a

1469
00:44:07,181 --> 00:44:11,860
fair and you're going to bring
down this beloved national hero,

1470
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:12,993
stupid,

1471
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:14,620
unbelievably stupid,

1472
00:44:14,621 --> 00:44:19,621
but also unbelievably revealing about
how partitioned our government truly is

1473
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:27,120
and how difficult it would
be to get access to some
critical information if this

1474
00:44:28,451 --> 00:44:32,580
information is in any
way deemed too sensitive

1475
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:37,580
or too controversial or two to whatever
to paradigm shifting for average eyes.

1476
00:44:39,090 --> 00:44:39,181
Well,

1477
00:44:39,181 --> 00:44:40,620
let's make this very simple.

1478
00:44:41,370 --> 00:44:44,040
If you acknowledge that the
UFOS are there and they're real,

1479
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:45,810
um,

1480
00:44:45,810 --> 00:44:48,780
and anyone with an Iq over mud,

1481
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:50,400
it's going to ask the question,

1482
00:44:50,401 --> 00:44:51,780
then how did they get here?

1483
00:44:52,050 --> 00:44:53,700
If you asked that question,

1484
00:44:54,210 --> 00:44:57,180
we have the answers for it
and if the public knows that,

1485
00:44:57,181 --> 00:44:59,280
then they know we don't need Exxon mobile.

1486
00:44:59,281 --> 00:45:00,270
We don't need oil,

1487
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:00,781
gas,

1488
00:45:00,781 --> 00:45:01,260
coal,

1489
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:03,450
nuclear power or centralized utility grid.

1490
00:45:03,451 --> 00:45:06,840
That's assuming though that most people
believe that the Ufos are real because I

1491
00:45:06,860 --> 00:45:08,760
know 50 to 60% do now.

1492
00:45:08,970 --> 00:45:10,590
I think they say that.

1493
00:45:10,710 --> 00:45:11,790
I think they say,

1494
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:16,440
but I think the most of the time we'll
look for terrestrial explanations.

1495
00:45:16,441 --> 00:45:17,610
Most rational people,

1496
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:18,091
well no,

1497
00:45:18,091 --> 00:45:19,670
actually what I'm now this,

1498
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:23,880
there was just a poll that came out a
month ago and there's actually 43% of the

1499
00:45:23,881 --> 00:45:28,470
public believe that extra terrestrial
life has been on the planet and it's here

1500
00:45:28,471 --> 00:45:28,770
now.

1501
00:45:28,770 --> 00:45:32,340
51% believed that the earth
is less than 10,000 years old.

1502
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:34,020
Just don't have that yet.

1503
00:45:34,021 --> 00:45:34,560
Well there,

1504
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:36,060
well I don't know if it's that high.

1505
00:45:36,450 --> 00:45:38,460
I heard it was about a
quarter of the population.

1506
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:43,480
So Gallup poll I think 2010 2010 they
got 51% of the flat Earth Society still

1507
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,230
has a lot of members I guess.

1508
00:45:49,231 --> 00:45:49,891
But you know,

1509
00:45:49,891 --> 00:45:50,130
here,

1510
00:45:50,130 --> 00:45:50,610
here's the,

1511
00:45:50,610 --> 00:45:54,420
here's the bigger issue is that
if you bring this information out,

1512
00:45:54,580 --> 00:45:54,870
uh,

1513
00:45:54,870 --> 00:45:56,730
and let's,

1514
00:45:56,790 --> 00:46:00,420
let's say that one of the objectives
of what I'm working on now,

1515
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:01,500
let me just clear that up.

1516
00:46:01,650 --> 00:46:02,910
46% okay.

1517
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:06,070
Creationist view of
human origins 40 46 well,

1518
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:07,560
but of the creationist view,

1519
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:10,590
not all those people think that world
is 10,000 years old and I think that

1520
00:46:10,591 --> 00:46:12,480
number is only about 15 years though.

1521
00:46:12,481 --> 00:46:13,620
They're saying 10,000 years.

1522
00:46:13,621 --> 00:46:14,610
This is what in this study,

1523
00:46:14,611 --> 00:46:15,660
the Gal study,

1524
00:46:15,670 --> 00:46:16,640
these very specifically,

1525
00:46:16,690 --> 00:46:18,810
46% of Americans believe
the creations for you,

1526
00:46:18,811 --> 00:46:23,010
that God created humans in their present
form at a time within the last 10,000

1527
00:46:23,011 --> 00:46:23,220
years.

1528
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:23,791
Oh God,

1529
00:46:23,791 --> 00:46:25,200
you're gonna make me move to Norway.

1530
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:25,820
Anyway,

1531
00:46:25,820 --> 00:46:28,950
that was a good choice to count is
right there and they're bad ass.

1532
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:36,380
Just to throw some salt on your
idea that you want me to look,

1533
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:37,441
I told you that I'm,

1534
00:46:37,441 --> 00:46:37,651
I'm,

1535
00:46:37,651 --> 00:46:39,480
I'm a huge fan of the UFO experience.

1536
00:46:39,481 --> 00:46:39,661
I mean,

1537
00:46:39,661 --> 00:46:41,130
I really want it to be real,

1538
00:46:41,131 --> 00:46:46,131
but just because 47% of whatever the fuck
think 46% think that the earth is less

1539
00:46:46,581 --> 00:46:46,671
than,

1540
00:46:46,671 --> 00:46:47,850
or you're writing and,

1541
00:46:47,851 --> 00:46:48,211
but the,

1542
00:46:48,211 --> 00:46:50,670
the evidence speaks for itself
and I told someone once,

1543
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:51,960
but does it,

1544
00:46:52,210 --> 00:46:53,190
what percentage?

1545
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:53,610
Okay,

1546
00:46:53,610 --> 00:46:53,881
let's,

1547
00:46:53,881 --> 00:46:54,900
let's just be honest.

1548
00:46:54,980 --> 00:46:55,740
Or,

1549
00:46:55,740 --> 00:46:56,573
or rather,

1550
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:57,510
let's open this.

1551
00:46:57,570 --> 00:47:00,810
What percentage of Ufo sightings are real,

1552
00:47:00,870 --> 00:47:01,231
what,

1553
00:47:01,231 --> 00:47:01,500
how,

1554
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:06,300
what percentage are totally made up
and what percentage are a confusion.

1555
00:47:06,810 --> 00:47:08,610
But that's not the metric we're using.

1556
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:09,780
We're going by,

1557
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:10,380
uh,

1558
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:13,920
government release documents were going
by people who are insiders who have

1559
00:47:13,921 --> 00:47:15,480
actually handled extra trust.

1560
00:47:15,610 --> 00:47:16,443
Right?

1561
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:18,450
So when you're talking about experiences,

1562
00:47:18,451 --> 00:47:21,840
you're talking about experiences
from people who are 100% credible.

1563
00:47:22,060 --> 00:47:23,010
The bulletproof,

1564
00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:24,571
only that,

1565
00:47:24,571 --> 00:47:25,720
but if you have the,

1566
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:28,170
the former minister defense,

1567
00:47:28,171 --> 00:47:30,080
a candidate say that
he checked out with a u

1568
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:35,080
s air force general that in fact there
was an accident that happened in New

1569
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:38,200
Mexico in 1947 which people call Roswell.

1570
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:41,830
And that what Phillip Corso Colonel Course
of wrote in his book the day after co

1571
00:47:42,310 --> 00:47:44,590
Roscoe was substantially correct.

1572
00:47:45,010 --> 00:47:45,151
Uh,

1573
00:47:45,151 --> 00:47:45,490
and,

1574
00:47:45,490 --> 00:47:45,731
and,

1575
00:47:45,731 --> 00:47:46,540
and this is,

1576
00:47:46,540 --> 00:47:46,960
uh,

1577
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:50,890
the honorable Paul Hellyer and he and
I did a press conference in Toronto a

1578
00:47:50,890 --> 00:47:51,723
couple of years ago and,

1579
00:47:51,730 --> 00:47:51,880
uh,

1580
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:53,650
he is completely verified this.

1581
00:47:53,651 --> 00:47:54,161
So the,

1582
00:47:54,161 --> 00:47:54,891
the question is,

1583
00:47:54,891 --> 00:47:57,460
and then the same thing happened with
five star Admiral Lord Heal Norton.

1584
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:02,140
I mean here he was the minister of defense
and he found out after the fact that

1585
00:48:02,141 --> 00:48:04,960
in fact an extra trust will vehicle
had landed at the bent waters,

1586
00:48:04,990 --> 00:48:05,650
uh,

1587
00:48:05,650 --> 00:48:09,670
earlier for space at
Rendlesham forest in England.

1588
00:48:10,030 --> 00:48:13,570
And we have multiple disclosure
project witnesses who were there.

1589
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:17,050
And it came out recently that uh,

1590
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:20,920
the Ministry of Defense in Great Britain
released the documents on that where

1591
00:48:20,921 --> 00:48:23,980
they had physical evidence that
this thing actually did land,

1592
00:48:24,270 --> 00:48:24,571
uh,

1593
00:48:24,571 --> 00:48:26,050
and left physical traces,

1594
00:48:26,051 --> 00:48:27,070
et cetera and so on.

1595
00:48:27,310 --> 00:48:28,330
So I tell people,

1596
00:48:28,390 --> 00:48:28,930
you know,

1597
00:48:28,930 --> 00:48:29,320
um,

1598
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:30,490
usually in the New York Times say,

1599
00:48:30,491 --> 00:48:30,641
well,

1600
00:48:30,641 --> 00:48:33,490
we need two or three corroborating
witnesses to something,

1601
00:48:33,491 --> 00:48:34,750
particularly in three,

1602
00:48:34,751 --> 00:48:36,610
if it's a very controversial story.

1603
00:48:36,850 --> 00:48:37,121
I said,

1604
00:48:37,121 --> 00:48:37,301
yes,

1605
00:48:37,301 --> 00:48:40,330
but the disclosure project has
hundreds of these sort of people,

1606
00:48:40,331 --> 00:48:42,070
thousands of cases like this.

1607
00:48:42,370 --> 00:48:44,730
And we're not talking about just
people seeing something in the sky.

1608
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:46,090
This is per event.

1609
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:47,500
They don't mean like,

1610
00:48:47,530 --> 00:48:47,810
oh,

1611
00:48:47,810 --> 00:48:48,341
but we have,

1612
00:48:48,341 --> 00:48:48,970
we have an,

1613
00:48:48,970 --> 00:48:49,780
we have event,

1614
00:48:49,780 --> 00:48:51,730
we have multiple ones for this landing.

1615
00:48:51,790 --> 00:48:52,480
It knows from Fort,

1616
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:54,820
we have multiple ones from
the might not North Dakota.

1617
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:58,420
It had like how many do you have
a where there'll be some of them,

1618
00:48:58,600 --> 00:48:58,811
you know,

1619
00:48:58,811 --> 00:48:59,411
four or five,

1620
00:48:59,411 --> 00:49:00,890
six at one event.

1621
00:49:00,891 --> 00:49:03,100
And they are very
credible military people.

1622
00:49:03,430 --> 00:49:04,740
And so why isn't,

1623
00:49:04,810 --> 00:49:05,080
you know,

1624
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:05,851
why isn't the,

1625
00:49:05,851 --> 00:49:06,041
the,

1626
00:49:06,041 --> 00:49:08,140
the lame stream news,

1627
00:49:08,141 --> 00:49:10,900
the mainstream news reporting this,

1628
00:49:11,110 --> 00:49:15,580
if you put together this
amount of information and
then the question becomes how

1629
00:49:15,581 --> 00:49:19,960
free is our media and how free is our
market and how free is our country?

1630
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:22,810
Because I think there's more
corruption than people can imagine.

1631
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:23,561
And uh,

1632
00:49:23,561 --> 00:49:25,450
I'm not a conspiracy theory person.

1633
00:49:25,750 --> 00:49:26,201
I deal,

1634
00:49:26,201 --> 00:49:26,800
wait a minute.

1635
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:27,430
Yes you are.

1636
00:49:27,430 --> 00:49:27,551
No,

1637
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:28,211
I'm not there.

1638
00:49:28,211 --> 00:49:28,750
You know,

1639
00:49:28,750 --> 00:49:28,930
I'm,

1640
00:49:28,930 --> 00:49:29,290
no,

1641
00:49:29,290 --> 00:49:29,681
I'm not,

1642
00:49:29,681 --> 00:49:30,431
but just be honest,

1643
00:49:30,431 --> 00:49:31,970
I just don't like the [inaudible]

1644
00:49:34,020 --> 00:49:36,040
island about Ufo conspiracy.

1645
00:49:36,050 --> 00:49:36,360
It was like,

1646
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:38,830
it was the mafia conspiracy
of a criminal enterprise.

1647
00:49:38,831 --> 00:49:39,101
Yes.

1648
00:49:39,101 --> 00:49:39,970
But it's not a theory,

1649
00:49:39,971 --> 00:49:40,804
it's a fact.

1650
00:49:41,460 --> 00:49:43,780
So there's a big difference between,

1651
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:44,990
um,

1652
00:49:44,990 --> 00:49:48,490
there obviously you're talking about a
Ufo conspiracy and energy conspiracy.

1653
00:49:48,491 --> 00:49:51,280
You're talking about
suppressing information.

1654
00:49:51,281 --> 00:49:53,360
He pulled conspire and
their own interests.

1655
00:49:53,361 --> 00:49:54,250
And if you're in Canada,

1656
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:54,971
I don't know.

1657
00:49:54,971 --> 00:49:56,770
I know you don't like conspiracy theorist,

1658
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:57,760
but okay.

1659
00:49:57,820 --> 00:49:58,121
When no,

1660
00:49:58,121 --> 00:49:59,840
I just don't see the term is used.

1661
00:50:00,490 --> 00:50:01,660
I think it's misused,

1662
00:50:01,661 --> 00:50:02,494
I think.

1663
00:50:02,670 --> 00:50:03,311
And I think that,

1664
00:50:03,311 --> 00:50:03,551
you know,

1665
00:50:03,551 --> 00:50:04,330
just waited.

1666
00:50:04,330 --> 00:50:04,781
It's loaded.

1667
00:50:04,781 --> 00:50:05,890
It's a loaded thing.

1668
00:50:06,010 --> 00:50:06,791
And it's like,

1669
00:50:06,791 --> 00:50:07,031
you know,

1670
00:50:07,031 --> 00:50:08,260
it's like when Larry King asked me,

1671
00:50:08,261 --> 00:50:09,130
do you believe I said,

1672
00:50:09,131 --> 00:50:09,311
well,

1673
00:50:09,311 --> 00:50:09,581
you know,

1674
00:50:09,581 --> 00:50:11,950
I believe in a lot of things
that you can't see improve.

1675
00:50:12,250 --> 00:50:14,950
But if I have 4,000 cases
where these things have landed,

1676
00:50:14,951 --> 00:50:17,170
if I have hundreds of
photographs and videotapes,

1677
00:50:17,171 --> 00:50:20,740
if I have dozens of top secret
guys who can corroborate this,

1678
00:50:20,890 --> 00:50:22,100
why is that a belief?

1679
00:50:22,101 --> 00:50:22,261
I mean,

1680
00:50:22,261 --> 00:50:23,200
you believe in God,

1681
00:50:23,410 --> 00:50:24,100
uh,

1682
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:25,420
and some other things,

1683
00:50:25,421 --> 00:50:25,961
but I mean,

1684
00:50:25,961 --> 00:50:27,290
this is not a matter of belief.

1685
00:50:27,350 --> 00:50:29,030
Most people believe that.

1686
00:50:29,031 --> 00:50:33,110
I'll quote Neil degrasse Tyson who says
that eyewitness testimony is the least

1687
00:50:33,111 --> 00:50:35,250
reliable of all pieces of evidence.

1688
00:50:35,260 --> 00:50:35,900
It's right.

1689
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:36,440
Um,

1690
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:40,960
but what physical evidence do you
have that goes along with eye witness

1691
00:50:40,961 --> 00:50:42,890
testimony that you believe
is the most compelling?

1692
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:44,780
Well,

1693
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:46,970
I think the most
compelling that I've ever,

1694
00:50:49,150 --> 00:50:49,983
um,

1695
00:50:50,730 --> 00:50:52,350
it's something we're working on right now.

1696
00:50:53,820 --> 00:50:54,640
And,

1697
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:55,260
um,

1698
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:58,170
it remains to be seen if it's
going to be what we think it is.

1699
00:50:58,171 --> 00:50:59,730
And we're going to know fairly soon,

1700
00:51:00,540 --> 00:51:01,890
and I don't want to get ahead of myself,

1701
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:06,780
but I was introduced to an
institute that acquired,

1702
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:07,440
um,

1703
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:11,850
a small humanoid being
about six inches in length.

1704
00:51:12,850 --> 00:51:13,683
Um,

1705
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:15,620
this is in the trailer for serious,

1706
00:51:15,621 --> 00:51:16,341
I've seen this,

1707
00:51:16,341 --> 00:51:20,690
this little skeleton that's x rayed
and cat scanned and we're now doing the

1708
00:51:20,691 --> 00:51:24,200
genetic workup at the top university
in the world that's doing this,

1709
00:51:24,230 --> 00:51:24,660
um,

1710
00:51:24,660 --> 00:51:24,890
hope.

1711
00:51:24,890 --> 00:51:25,431
Pull that up,

1712
00:51:25,431 --> 00:51:25,770
right,

1713
00:51:25,770 --> 00:51:29,390
because it's a very freaky people
on Ustream and Vimeo can see this.

1714
00:51:29,391 --> 00:51:29,780
Uh,

1715
00:51:29,780 --> 00:51:30,230
we'll just,

1716
00:51:30,230 --> 00:51:30,441
we'll,

1717
00:51:30,441 --> 00:51:30,950
you know what,

1718
00:51:30,950 --> 00:51:33,740
let's just play the entire
trailer for you and,

1719
00:51:33,741 --> 00:51:33,860
uh,

1720
00:51:33,860 --> 00:51:35,390
get people excited about this movie.

1721
00:51:35,630 --> 00:51:35,961
Now,

1722
00:51:35,961 --> 00:51:37,130
who found this,

1723
00:51:37,131 --> 00:51:37,460
uh,

1724
00:51:37,460 --> 00:51:40,130
this alien being and where
did they acquire this thing?

1725
00:51:41,180 --> 00:51:41,690
It was,

1726
00:51:41,690 --> 00:51:41,980
uh,

1727
00:51:41,980 --> 00:51:43,460
I'm not at liberty to,

1728
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:45,050
I'm still waiting to see if this person,

1729
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:45,801
but it's an as,

1730
00:51:45,801 --> 00:51:46,730
it might be Horse Shit,

1731
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:47,120
right?

1732
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:48,080
It's a possibility.

1733
00:51:48,790 --> 00:51:49,623
No,

1734
00:51:50,220 --> 00:51:50,480
no,

1735
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:51,250
I know.

1736
00:51:51,250 --> 00:51:54,920
All I'm saying is that
it isn't organic beam.

1737
00:51:55,010 --> 00:52:00,010
It is an organic paid is the cat scan
shows the lungs on the inside it has 10

1738
00:52:00,021 --> 00:52:01,310
ribs and not 12.

1739
00:52:01,670 --> 00:52:02,180
Um,

1740
00:52:02,180 --> 00:52:07,180
we have now proven from bone density
that it's at least several years old and

1741
00:52:07,911 --> 00:52:09,080
it's only six inches long.

1742
00:52:09,650 --> 00:52:10,250
Um,

1743
00:52:10,250 --> 00:52:11,440
so the,

1744
00:52:11,490 --> 00:52:11,710
the,

1745
00:52:11,710 --> 00:52:12,020
the,

1746
00:52:12,020 --> 00:52:14,030
the tiny approved that from bone density.

1747
00:52:14,350 --> 00:52:17,570
That's medically we look at the epiphyseal
plates and the cow much calcium in

1748
00:52:17,571 --> 00:52:18,110
other words.

1749
00:52:18,110 --> 00:52:18,310
Right.

1750
00:52:18,310 --> 00:52:21,440
But isn't it why you're dealing
with a completely alien species?

1751
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:21,621
No,

1752
00:52:21,621 --> 00:52:21,741
no,

1753
00:52:21,741 --> 00:52:21,861
no.

1754
00:52:21,861 --> 00:52:23,210
I'm saying if you were to go back,

1755
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:25,340
if you're going to assume
that it's not easy,

1756
00:52:25,790 --> 00:52:26,840
then you look at it,

1757
00:52:26,841 --> 00:52:27,531
what would this be?

1758
00:52:27,531 --> 00:52:28,364
If it were human?

1759
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:28,961
I see what you're saying.

1760
00:52:28,961 --> 00:52:29,071
Okay.

1761
00:52:29,071 --> 00:52:31,180
So you have to go through
an algorithm of an,

1762
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:36,200
and it's a diagnosis of exclusion we could
say in medicine because if it's not a

1763
00:52:36,381 --> 00:52:37,970
miscarried or aborted fetus,

1764
00:52:37,971 --> 00:52:40,850
which is the size of what
this would be about 22 weeks,

1765
00:52:41,350 --> 00:52:41,900
um,

1766
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:43,490
if it's not any known primate,

1767
00:52:43,970 --> 00:52:44,450
uh,

1768
00:52:44,450 --> 00:52:47,570
it's not a fossil cause it has
organic material in DNA material.

1769
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:48,850
We've already extracted,

1770
00:52:48,950 --> 00:52:49,680
we clip the,

1771
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:50,300
uh,

1772
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:51,021
one of the ribs,

1773
00:52:51,021 --> 00:52:55,310
two of the ribs and I have gotten to
DNA material out of the rib of internal

1774
00:52:55,370 --> 00:52:56,203
Miro.

1775
00:52:56,270 --> 00:52:58,700
And so this is being processed
right now as we speak,

1776
00:52:58,701 --> 00:52:59,200
literally.

1777
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:00,350
So if it was a human,

1778
00:53:00,351 --> 00:53:01,700
it would be several years old.

1779
00:53:01,701 --> 00:53:03,410
So that proves that it's not a human.

1780
00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:04,070
Uh,

1781
00:53:04,070 --> 00:53:04,903
there is no,

1782
00:53:05,630 --> 00:53:10,630
there's no form of dwarfism or any
other genetic anomaly known in the

1783
00:53:11,691 --> 00:53:12,524
literature,

1784
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:13,101
uh,

1785
00:53:13,101 --> 00:53:18,020
according to the world's expert in this
area that would explain something of

1786
00:53:18,021 --> 00:53:21,590
this age that it's this and also
that has these abnormalities.

1787
00:53:21,620 --> 00:53:22,580
If you look at the skull,

1788
00:53:22,850 --> 00:53:23,750
if you look at the,

1789
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:24,440
um,

1790
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:25,600
the fact that has ribs,

1791
00:53:25,601 --> 00:53:27,600
there are new genetic syndromes
where you have 10 ribs.

1792
00:53:27,630 --> 00:53:29,100
If you see this thing in person,

1793
00:53:29,550 --> 00:53:31,740
I was the third person
to hold it and handle it.

1794
00:53:32,300 --> 00:53:32,600
Um,

1795
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:33,361
and I did the,

1796
00:53:33,361 --> 00:53:34,740
I didn't say autopsy on it,

1797
00:53:34,741 --> 00:53:35,480
but I did the,

1798
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:36,270
the,

1799
00:53:36,270 --> 00:53:37,050
the tests on it.

1800
00:53:37,050 --> 00:53:38,710
And how long had it been dead for you?

1801
00:53:38,730 --> 00:53:39,850
Had no idea that,

1802
00:53:39,851 --> 00:53:41,900
that we didn't get enough material from,

1803
00:53:41,910 --> 00:53:44,010
we didn't want to damage
this little thing too much.

1804
00:53:44,340 --> 00:53:48,090
So the carbon dating on
it will be the next step.

1805
00:53:48,390 --> 00:53:52,290
We wanted to be sure we had enough genetic
material and if we had to go back and

1806
00:53:52,291 --> 00:53:54,600
we didn't want to destroy,

1807
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:55,510
uh,

1808
00:53:55,510 --> 00:53:56,221
in any way.

1809
00:53:56,221 --> 00:53:56,680
So we're,

1810
00:53:56,680 --> 00:53:58,420
we're working a scientific
algorithm on there.

1811
00:53:58,421 --> 00:53:59,520
This is actually the people,

1812
00:53:59,521 --> 00:54:03,270
the public who were supporting the film
serious or the reason why we were able

1813
00:54:03,271 --> 00:54:04,260
to do all these studies.

1814
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:05,160
How is this,

1815
00:54:05,161 --> 00:54:05,520
um,

1816
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:06,720
how this thing preserved,

1817
00:54:07,620 --> 00:54:07,951
you know,

1818
00:54:07,951 --> 00:54:09,360
but it was found in a very,

1819
00:54:09,361 --> 00:54:11,250
very dry desert area.

1820
00:54:11,490 --> 00:54:12,323
Um,

1821
00:54:12,390 --> 00:54:13,920
and it's just very desiccated.

1822
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:15,240
It's very dry it out.

1823
00:54:15,570 --> 00:54:16,260
Um,

1824
00:54:16,260 --> 00:54:17,250
and uh,

1825
00:54:17,251 --> 00:54:19,350
it was not in any sort of preservative.

1826
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:20,273
Um,

1827
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:22,440
and now it died a traumatic death.

1828
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:26,130
We know that behind the right mastoid
air cells behind your ear here,

1829
00:54:26,430 --> 00:54:31,080
that skull is crashed in and it's
a little asymmetrical on the jaw.

1830
00:54:31,081 --> 00:54:34,530
And the right humerus is
fractured through and through.

1831
00:54:34,950 --> 00:54:35,640
Um,

1832
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:36,390
but,

1833
00:54:36,390 --> 00:54:36,661
uh,

1834
00:54:36,661 --> 00:54:38,910
and it happened at Mortimer shortly.

1835
00:54:38,911 --> 00:54:43,320
Purpose more than we think it was the
fatal blow to this particular being.

1836
00:54:43,620 --> 00:54:43,861
Now,

1837
00:54:43,861 --> 00:54:44,850
what is this beam?

1838
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:45,360
Um,

1839
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:46,193
when you look at it,

1840
00:54:46,220 --> 00:54:46,530
um,

1841
00:54:46,530 --> 00:54:48,990
almost every scientist
that has seen it goes,

1842
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:50,410
it looks like an EDT.

1843
00:54:50,730 --> 00:54:51,090
Uh,

1844
00:54:51,090 --> 00:54:52,290
but we don't know.

1845
00:54:52,350 --> 00:54:54,440
All I'm going to say is that we're not
gonna be able to sit cause they're,

1846
00:54:54,570 --> 00:54:54,790
you know,

1847
00:54:54,790 --> 00:54:55,890
even the genetics,

1848
00:54:55,891 --> 00:54:57,690
there's no database to compare it to.

1849
00:54:58,050 --> 00:55:00,300
Now we have the whole human
genome to compare it to,

1850
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:01,500
which is what we're doing right now.

1851
00:55:02,190 --> 00:55:06,720
And we have all the literature
that the world's expert in skeletal

1852
00:55:06,780 --> 00:55:07,740
abnormalities.

1853
00:55:07,830 --> 00:55:08,530
Uh,

1854
00:55:08,530 --> 00:55:08,730
the,

1855
00:55:08,730 --> 00:55:09,001
I mean,

1856
00:55:09,001 --> 00:55:12,900
the expert in the world looked at this
thing is that this is nothing that I know

1857
00:55:12,901 --> 00:55:15,330
of and that has ever
been seen on this planet.

1858
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:16,733
Um,

1859
00:55:16,830 --> 00:55:19,110
and so the question then becomes,

1860
00:55:19,111 --> 00:55:20,460
what is it now?

1861
00:55:20,461 --> 00:55:22,920
It turns out it was found in an area of a,

1862
00:55:22,940 --> 00:55:24,420
the Atacama desert in Chile

1863
00:55:26,190 --> 00:55:26,760
that,

1864
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:27,570
uh,

1865
00:55:27,570 --> 00:55:30,000
native peoples have
reports of these objects,

1866
00:55:30,001 --> 00:55:32,610
luminous objects going in and out
of the foothills of the Andes,

1867
00:55:32,611 --> 00:55:34,950
the famous famous for very famous,

1868
00:55:35,340 --> 00:55:36,060
very famous.

1869
00:55:36,060 --> 00:55:37,050
And um,

1870
00:55:37,620 --> 00:55:38,010
uh,

1871
00:55:38,010 --> 00:55:39,510
also in these remote,

1872
00:55:39,590 --> 00:55:39,930
uh,

1873
00:55:39,930 --> 00:55:40,950
native villages,

1874
00:55:40,951 --> 00:55:43,260
there are reports of
these very small beans,

1875
00:55:43,290 --> 00:55:44,810
upright humanoid type beans.

1876
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:48,900
Said that also the area where the
constructed the VLT telescopic array,

1877
00:55:49,140 --> 00:55:51,990
one of the very large telescope I believe.

1878
00:55:51,991 --> 00:55:52,531
I think there are,

1879
00:55:52,531 --> 00:55:52,651
yeah,

1880
00:55:52,651 --> 00:55:55,350
cause it's very dark area and
there have been a lot of astronomy.

1881
00:55:55,710 --> 00:55:56,041
Uh,

1882
00:55:56,041 --> 00:55:57,180
and we also know a,

1883
00:55:57,220 --> 00:56:02,220
one of our witnesses who was manning a
facility on the Peruvian Bolivian border

1884
00:56:03,751 --> 00:56:05,310
that's not too far from this area,

1885
00:56:05,670 --> 00:56:08,250
was there in the early
nineties when we were using a,

1886
00:56:08,310 --> 00:56:08,730
uh,

1887
00:56:08,730 --> 00:56:13,730
Sdi star wars system to track Iti craft
and hit them with electromagnetic pulse

1888
00:56:13,861 --> 00:56:14,310
weapons.

1889
00:56:14,310 --> 00:56:19,310
And one was downed and crashed on
the Peruvian Bolivian border with

1890
00:56:20,191 --> 00:56:22,290
electromagnetic pulse weapons.

1891
00:56:22,410 --> 00:56:22,621
Yeah.

1892
00:56:22,621 --> 00:56:23,800
This is who did this.

1893
00:56:23,801 --> 00:56:25,060
I did the air force,

1894
00:56:25,061 --> 00:56:25,990
the army,

1895
00:56:25,991 --> 00:56:26,470
like,

1896
00:56:26,470 --> 00:56:27,303
do we know?

1897
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:27,851
Yeah,

1898
00:56:27,851 --> 00:56:28,301
we know,

1899
00:56:28,301 --> 00:56:29,770
but I mean it's this group majestic,

1900
00:56:30,410 --> 00:56:30,740
you know,

1901
00:56:30,740 --> 00:56:33,580
if you were to talk to the general,

1902
00:56:33,581 --> 00:56:35,800
I briefed who's head of the
defense intelligence agency,

1903
00:56:35,801 --> 00:56:37,990
which is almost as big as the
CIA that's in the Pentagon.

1904
00:56:38,590 --> 00:56:39,730
He know anything about this.

1905
00:56:40,210 --> 00:56:41,890
So you say who's doing it?

1906
00:56:41,891 --> 00:56:41,981
It's,

1907
00:56:41,981 --> 00:56:42,760
it's not,

1908
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:46,510
it's kind of almost not the correct
even way of framing it is to say,

1909
00:56:46,870 --> 00:56:47,380
uh,

1910
00:56:47,380 --> 00:56:48,100
you know,

1911
00:56:48,100 --> 00:56:48,400
when,

1912
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:50,710
when senator annually
that he just passed away.

1913
00:56:50,711 --> 00:56:52,240
Wonderful senator from Hawaii,

1914
00:56:52,530 --> 00:56:52,720
you know,

1915
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:57,720
he said there exists a secret
government with its own air force,

1916
00:56:58,060 --> 00:56:59,650
its own funding mechanism,

1917
00:57:00,070 --> 00:57:01,210
its own navy.

1918
00:57:01,510 --> 00:57:03,370
I'm quoting almost exactly.

1919
00:57:03,460 --> 00:57:05,710
And at the end actually is a great,

1920
00:57:06,130 --> 00:57:06,940
uh,

1921
00:57:06,940 --> 00:57:11,940
speech by the senator and it's because
he had run across that there that this

1922
00:57:12,101 --> 00:57:12,934
was going on.

1923
00:57:12,970 --> 00:57:13,751
So the question is,

1924
00:57:13,751 --> 00:57:15,100
who's running this?

1925
00:57:15,101 --> 00:57:15,281
Well,

1926
00:57:15,281 --> 00:57:16,720
they've gone off the reservation.

1927
00:57:16,721 --> 00:57:20,470
There's certainly no congressional
oversight or presidential oversight over

1928
00:57:20,471 --> 00:57:21,460
these rogue elements.

1929
00:57:21,700 --> 00:57:23,740
And I think that is a
threat to our democracy,

1930
00:57:23,741 --> 00:57:26,170
but it's also a threat to
our security in the world.

1931
00:57:26,410 --> 00:57:30,640
If what we've learned is true
for multiple military insiders,

1932
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:35,530
that we have been attempting to target
these extraterrestrial vehicles and down

1933
00:57:35,531 --> 00:57:35,980
them.

1934
00:57:35,980 --> 00:57:37,330
How stupid is that?

1935
00:57:37,630 --> 00:57:40,960
And you're dealing with civilizations
that could turn the earth into a pink mist

1936
00:57:40,961 --> 00:57:43,510
floating through space in
a nanosecond and we're,

1937
00:57:43,511 --> 00:57:44,890
they're firing at them.

1938
00:57:44,980 --> 00:57:45,730
Why,

1939
00:57:45,730 --> 00:57:46,031
you know,

1940
00:57:46,031 --> 00:57:46,691
I mean does that,

1941
00:57:46,691 --> 00:57:46,950
but it,

1942
00:57:46,950 --> 00:57:48,460
you convinced that this happened.

1943
00:57:48,490 --> 00:57:49,090
Absolutely.

1944
00:57:49,090 --> 00:57:50,200
I absolutely know it is.

1945
00:57:50,230 --> 00:57:51,820
Cause I have too many insiders who,

1946
00:57:51,821 --> 00:57:54,100
who've been present when
we've done this sort of,

1947
00:57:54,130 --> 00:57:54,520
uh,

1948
00:57:54,520 --> 00:57:57,490
the weaponization of
electromagnetic signals.

1949
00:57:57,520 --> 00:57:58,870
What about disinformation?

1950
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:02,170
D You have most of the information
out there is disinformation.

1951
00:58:02,650 --> 00:58:05,500
I would say ever hit you
like any this might be,

1952
00:58:05,710 --> 00:58:06,670
I have no,

1953
00:58:06,671 --> 00:58:06,850
no,

1954
00:58:06,850 --> 00:58:07,840
not when I'm telling you,

1955
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:09,440
but uh,

1956
00:58:09,580 --> 00:58:11,560
have I ever been caught flat footed?

1957
00:58:11,561 --> 00:58:12,580
You almost.

1958
00:58:12,970 --> 00:58:13,540
Um,

1959
00:58:13,540 --> 00:58:14,080
and,

1960
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:14,950
but you know,

1961
00:58:14,951 --> 00:58:16,630
we're very careful and I have to say,

1962
00:58:16,631 --> 00:58:17,464
you know,

1963
00:58:17,530 --> 00:58:21,010
as a doctor who got into
this sort of accidentally,

1964
00:58:21,550 --> 00:58:26,550
and then I was tutored and mentored by
some really good people in the military

1965
00:58:26,980 --> 00:58:29,890
and the intelligence community
who wanted me to do this.

1966
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:32,320
And one of them is still to CIA,

1967
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:33,460
Phd guy.

1968
00:58:33,850 --> 00:58:34,331
And he says,

1969
00:58:34,331 --> 00:58:34,601
you know,

1970
00:58:34,601 --> 00:58:37,570
someone needs to do this
because the politicians are
never going to do it within

1971
00:58:37,571 --> 00:58:40,180
these big corporations are
absolutely not going to let it out.

1972
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:42,910
And this was back in the 90s.

1973
00:58:42,940 --> 00:58:43,511
And I said,

1974
00:58:43,511 --> 00:58:44,170
well,

1975
00:58:44,170 --> 00:58:45,310
what am I supposed to do?

1976
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:46,811
And Yeah,

1977
00:58:46,811 --> 00:58:47,840
one of the interesting thing we,

1978
00:58:47,841 --> 00:58:50,470
after we put this briefing
together for Clinton and,

1979
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:50,690
uh,

1980
00:58:50,690 --> 00:58:50,881
you know,

1981
00:58:50,881 --> 00:58:52,000
Lawrence Rockefeller,

1982
00:58:52,060 --> 00:58:52,410
uh,

1983
00:58:52,410 --> 00:58:52,710
I,

1984
00:58:52,710 --> 00:58:55,450
I put the concept together,

1985
00:58:55,480 --> 00:58:58,210
the best available evidence
and all these cases,

1986
00:58:58,380 --> 00:58:58,601
uh,

1987
00:58:58,601 --> 00:59:01,780
and then Lawrence Rockefeller hosted
a bill and Hillary Clinton at the

1988
00:59:01,781 --> 00:59:04,930
Rockefeller ranch and that it had
me out there shortly before that.

1989
00:59:05,410 --> 00:59:10,030
And Mr Rockefeller was the white hat
in the family who wanted to end the

1990
00:59:10,031 --> 00:59:10,864
secrecy,

1991
00:59:11,110 --> 00:59:12,340
unlike some of his,

1992
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:13,510
his family.

1993
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:14,381
Uh,

1994
00:59:14,381 --> 00:59:14,721
and,

1995
00:59:14,721 --> 00:59:15,161
and he,

1996
00:59:15,161 --> 00:59:16,390
so he said to me,

1997
00:59:16,750 --> 00:59:17,080
Oh,

1998
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:21,130
one night I was at on his porch
on a deck in the grand Tetons,

1999
00:59:21,230 --> 00:59:22,063
the [inaudible]

2000
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:22,521
ranch,

2001
00:59:22,521 --> 00:59:22,881
and,

2002
00:59:22,881 --> 00:59:23,714
and he said,

2003
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:24,620
uh,

2004
00:59:24,620 --> 00:59:27,440
we really need you to
hurry up and do this.

2005
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:28,550
And I said,

2006
00:59:28,550 --> 00:59:28,791
Oh,

2007
00:59:28,791 --> 00:59:29,211
Lawrence,

2008
00:59:29,211 --> 00:59:30,950
I'm just a doctor in North Carolina.

2009
00:59:30,951 --> 00:59:31,970
I'm working in an er,

2010
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:32,720
you know,

2011
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:33,200
he says,

2012
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:33,470
no,

2013
00:59:33,470 --> 00:59:33,711
no,

2014
00:59:33,711 --> 00:59:34,311
you have to do it.

2015
00:59:34,311 --> 00:59:34,521
I said,

2016
00:59:34,521 --> 00:59:34,731
no,

2017
00:59:34,731 --> 00:59:35,160
I Lawrence,

2018
00:59:35,160 --> 00:59:36,740
you have to get these guys to do.

2019
00:59:36,741 --> 00:59:37,730
He says they will never do it.

2020
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:38,721
And I said,

2021
00:59:38,721 --> 00:59:39,021
Lawrence,

2022
00:59:39,021 --> 00:59:39,621
for God sakes,

2023
00:59:39,621 --> 00:59:40,071
you're old,

2024
00:59:40,071 --> 00:59:41,480
you're rich and you're Rockefeller.

2025
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:42,711
He says,

2026
00:59:42,711 --> 00:59:42,921
no.

2027
00:59:42,921 --> 00:59:43,281
He says,

2028
00:59:43,281 --> 00:59:48,281
the implications of this are so vast and
so profound that no aspect of life will

2029
00:59:48,321 --> 00:59:49,730
be unchanged when it comes out.

2030
00:59:50,030 --> 00:59:50,271
I said,

2031
00:59:50,271 --> 00:59:50,541
yes,

2032
00:59:50,541 --> 00:59:50,901
Lawrence,

2033
00:59:50,901 --> 00:59:51,734
that's why it's secret.

2034
00:59:52,360 --> 00:59:53,450
And then he said to me,

2035
00:59:53,510 --> 00:59:53,810
well,

2036
00:59:53,810 --> 00:59:56,120
that means those folks
aren't going to do it.

2037
00:59:56,150 --> 00:59:56,810
And then,

2038
00:59:56,810 --> 00:59:57,643
you know,

2039
00:59:58,010 --> 00:59:58,880
before that,

2040
00:59:58,881 --> 01:00:00,080
as shortly after that,

2041
01:00:00,120 --> 01:00:01,250
and I had this,

2042
01:00:01,251 --> 01:00:01,730
um,

2043
01:00:01,730 --> 01:00:03,620
meeting with the CIA director and,

2044
01:00:03,621 --> 01:00:04,454
and,

2045
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:08,060
and one of the president's friends
came to my house and this was a very

2046
01:00:08,061 --> 01:00:09,110
disturbing story.

2047
01:00:09,530 --> 01:00:11,660
I'm sitting at the
table with my four kids,

2048
01:00:12,290 --> 01:00:13,123
four daughters,

2049
01:00:13,550 --> 01:00:17,060
and this man who is very close
friends with the president,

2050
01:00:17,240 --> 01:00:18,050
uh,

2051
01:00:18,050 --> 01:00:19,520
Clinton says to me,

2052
01:00:19,570 --> 01:00:20,403
um,

2053
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:20,900
well,

2054
01:00:20,900 --> 01:00:21,051
you know,

2055
01:00:21,051 --> 01:00:23,450
they're very supportive of what you've
recommended in this white paper.

2056
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:23,751
I said,

2057
01:00:23,751 --> 01:00:24,584
great.

2058
01:00:25,060 --> 01:00:25,520
He says,

2059
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:26,720
but they're not going to do it.

2060
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:27,621
I said,

2061
01:00:27,621 --> 01:00:28,454
why not?

2062
01:00:28,580 --> 01:00:29,360
He says,

2063
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:32,420
they're convinced that if the
president steps into this too hard,

2064
01:00:32,421 --> 01:00:33,920
he'll end up like Jack Kennedy.

2065
01:00:34,430 --> 01:00:35,510
And I started laughing,

2066
01:00:35,511 --> 01:00:35,841
thinking,

2067
01:00:35,841 --> 01:00:37,670
what a load of nonsense.

2068
01:00:38,260 --> 01:00:40,310
And he stopped me.

2069
01:00:40,311 --> 01:00:40,551
He says,

2070
01:00:40,551 --> 01:00:40,641
no,

2071
01:00:40,641 --> 01:00:41,271
they're serious.

2072
01:00:41,271 --> 01:00:41,481
I said,

2073
01:00:41,481 --> 01:00:41,571
well,

2074
01:00:41,571 --> 01:00:42,890
don't say this in front of the kids.

2075
01:00:43,220 --> 01:00:45,500
So we went to the library in my house,

2076
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:46,070
um,

2077
01:00:46,070 --> 01:00:46,903
after dinner,

2078
01:00:47,540 --> 01:00:48,321
and I said,

2079
01:00:48,321 --> 01:00:49,700
what are you talking about Kevin?

2080
01:00:50,030 --> 01:00:50,690
And he said,

2081
01:00:50,690 --> 01:00:52,700
they really think this is too dangerous.

2082
01:00:52,701 --> 01:00:52,911
I said,

2083
01:00:52,911 --> 01:00:53,031
well,

2084
01:00:53,031 --> 01:00:54,020
what am I supposed to do?

2085
01:00:54,021 --> 01:00:54,920
What am I chop liver?

2086
01:00:55,220 --> 01:00:56,450
And he looked at me and he says,

2087
01:00:56,451 --> 01:00:56,601
yeah,

2088
01:00:56,601 --> 01:00:57,500
you're expendable.

2089
01:00:58,820 --> 01:01:02,870
So I've always viewed myself as the kind
of the throwaway guy and all of this.

2090
01:01:02,871 --> 01:01:05,210
I'm in a sense that these guys,

2091
01:01:05,211 --> 01:01:05,481
you know,

2092
01:01:05,481 --> 01:01:05,660
the,

2093
01:01:05,660 --> 01:01:08,720
the folks who have enormous
political power and corporate power,

2094
01:01:09,160 --> 01:01:09,290
uh,

2095
01:01:09,290 --> 01:01:11,360
even the ones who
support this very avidly,

2096
01:01:11,361 --> 01:01:12,290
and there's a lot of them,

2097
01:01:12,830 --> 01:01:13,663
um,

2098
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:15,110
they don't want to stick their necks out,

2099
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:15,921
but I'm confused.

2100
01:01:15,921 --> 01:01:16,250
Okay.

2101
01:01:16,250 --> 01:01:21,250
Why would they kill Bill Clinton if Bill
Clinton came out and said that we may

2102
01:01:21,740 --> 01:01:24,830
have evidence that there might be some
intelligent life out there in the world

2103
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:25,620
or the universe.

2104
01:01:25,620 --> 01:01:26,001
She goes,

2105
01:01:26,001 --> 01:01:26,301
you know,

2106
01:01:26,301 --> 01:01:27,440
it's like the rem song.

2107
01:01:27,441 --> 01:01:29,060
It's the end of the world as we know it.

2108
01:01:29,540 --> 01:01:30,321
Because if that,

2109
01:01:30,321 --> 01:01:32,570
if that happens when that happens,

2110
01:01:32,810 --> 01:01:33,643
people would panic.

2111
01:01:33,850 --> 01:01:34,270
No,

2112
01:01:34,270 --> 01:01:34,411
no,

2113
01:01:34,411 --> 01:01:34,520
no,

2114
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:34,671
no,

2115
01:01:34,671 --> 01:01:34,791
no,

2116
01:01:34,791 --> 01:01:34,941
no.

2117
01:01:34,941 --> 01:01:38,090
The public isn't going to panic over
this unless it's couched in a stupid way.

2118
01:01:38,120 --> 01:01:38,211
Well,

2119
01:01:38,211 --> 01:01:41,570
the public definitely will panic if the
president comes out and says there's Ufo

2120
01:01:41,571 --> 01:01:42,560
is and then it gets whacked.

2121
01:01:42,870 --> 01:01:43,520
Hmm.

2122
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:44,720
That would lead to panic.

2123
01:01:44,750 --> 01:01:44,960
Yeah,

2124
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:49,610
but there's a bigger problem if the
president doesn't have control access over

2125
01:01:49,611 --> 01:01:50,480
these projects.

2126
01:01:50,570 --> 01:01:53,990
He didn't want to talk about it
because then it shows the fact that our

2127
01:01:53,991 --> 01:01:58,070
democracy has been side lined
as Eisenhower warned us.

2128
01:01:58,071 --> 01:01:58,251
I mean,

2129
01:01:58,251 --> 01:01:59,020
the reason I said,

2130
01:01:59,020 --> 01:01:59,450
look,

2131
01:01:59,450 --> 01:02:01,640
I mean Eisenhower was not military.

2132
01:02:01,641 --> 01:02:02,900
It was a five star general.

2133
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:03,350
I have a phone.

2134
01:02:03,350 --> 01:02:04,310
You don't know the story.

2135
01:02:04,760 --> 01:02:06,830
Just fill people in on
the speech that he made.

2136
01:02:06,831 --> 01:02:10,670
Was he an active sitting president
leaving the last day of his presidency?

2137
01:02:10,900 --> 01:02:11,930
He basically said,

2138
01:02:11,931 --> 01:02:15,820
but where the military industrial
complex and this is the dangers.

2139
01:02:15,860 --> 01:02:16,050
And,

2140
01:02:16,050 --> 01:02:16,521
and he said,

2141
01:02:16,521 --> 01:02:20,340
the dangers of this enormous power
will be a threat to our democracy

2142
01:02:20,340 --> 01:02:21,173
and our way of life.

2143
01:02:21,570 --> 01:02:26,570
Now the reason he said that
is that between 1954 and 1960,

2144
01:02:27,030 --> 01:02:27,661
61,

2145
01:02:27,661 --> 01:02:28,830
when he was leaving office,

2146
01:02:29,190 --> 01:02:34,190
it was on his watch that the military
industrial complex reorganized under the

2147
01:02:35,790 --> 01:02:36,900
Rockefeller Commission of 1956.

2148
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:39,990
And Eisenhower lost complete
control over these projects.

2149
01:02:40,290 --> 01:02:43,980
I have a lieutenant colonel who was on
the plane with Jack Kennedy flying to

2150
01:02:43,981 --> 01:02:47,100
Berlin when he gave the
I am a Berliner speech.

2151
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:48,690
And um,

2152
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:51,090
and Jack Kenny was talking
about this Ufo issue,

2153
01:02:51,091 --> 01:02:54,290
but he turned to this guy who was
kind of the chief steward for,

2154
01:02:54,300 --> 01:02:55,900
for Air Force One who,

2155
01:02:55,901 --> 01:02:56,430
who I know.

2156
01:02:56,430 --> 01:02:57,263
And he said,

2157
01:02:57,510 --> 01:02:58,343
uh,

2158
01:02:58,680 --> 01:03:00,030
I know about this,

2159
01:03:00,060 --> 01:03:02,670
but the whole matter does the
President Kennedy saying this,

2160
01:03:02,671 --> 01:03:04,110
the whole matters out of my hands.

2161
01:03:04,111 --> 01:03:05,100
And I don't know why.

2162
01:03:06,180 --> 01:03:07,800
And this guy was stunned.

2163
01:03:07,801 --> 01:03:08,161
In fact,

2164
01:03:08,161 --> 01:03:08,821
I'll tell you,

2165
01:03:08,821 --> 01:03:10,270
there's a kind of a gruff colonel,

2166
01:03:10,890 --> 01:03:15,890
air force guy who was crying as he told
the story because it hit him that there

2167
01:03:16,231 --> 01:03:17,940
had been sort of a silent,

2168
01:03:19,110 --> 01:03:21,420
silent coup d'etat on this issue.

2169
01:03:21,690 --> 01:03:22,260
And,

2170
01:03:22,260 --> 01:03:23,070
um,

2171
01:03:23,070 --> 01:03:26,700
one of the problems in Washington when
I meet with people who are part of a

2172
01:03:26,701 --> 01:03:27,950
powerful committees and,

2173
01:03:27,951 --> 01:03:30,030
and politicians is that,

2174
01:03:30,090 --> 01:03:30,480
um,

2175
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:30,701
you know,

2176
01:03:30,701 --> 01:03:30,891
kind of,

2177
01:03:30,891 --> 01:03:33,000
they're kind of viewed as
place holders that come and go.

2178
01:03:33,420 --> 01:03:36,690
The mainstream media is really bread
and circus where they just keep wanting

2179
01:03:36,691 --> 01:03:37,790
people to be entertained with shock,

2180
01:03:37,791 --> 01:03:38,624
can dribble.

2181
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:39,700
Um,

2182
01:03:39,700 --> 01:03:41,040
the question becomes,

2183
01:03:41,041 --> 01:03:42,990
how are you going to get this story out?

2184
01:03:43,290 --> 01:03:44,041
And that's why,

2185
01:03:44,041 --> 01:03:45,810
I mean a few years ago I left medicine,

2186
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:46,860
uh,

2187
01:03:46,860 --> 01:03:50,040
which was a hard thing for
me to do because I mean,

2188
01:03:50,041 --> 01:03:51,240
I really love taking care of,

2189
01:03:51,450 --> 01:03:51,990
you know,

2190
01:03:51,990 --> 01:03:52,950
real emergencies.

2191
01:03:52,951 --> 01:03:53,730
And Trump,

2192
01:03:53,730 --> 01:03:56,490
did you do that for that
was in that er 10 years.

2193
01:03:56,600 --> 01:04:00,470
I was chairman of emergency
medicine and you know,

2194
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:01,950
the problem became for me,

2195
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:02,820
um,

2196
01:04:02,820 --> 01:04:04,230
the world's in an emergency.

2197
01:04:04,470 --> 01:04:05,220
So I said,

2198
01:04:05,220 --> 01:04:10,080
I'm an emergency doctor and I know an
emergency when I see one and we're in deep

2199
01:04:10,530 --> 01:04:12,660
trouble and so someone has to do this.

2200
01:04:12,660 --> 01:04:13,080
And,

2201
01:04:13,080 --> 01:04:14,520
but before I did that,

2202
01:04:14,521 --> 01:04:17,070
what you have to understand
is I went to everyone I could.

2203
01:04:17,370 --> 01:04:17,701
I mean,

2204
01:04:17,701 --> 01:04:19,040
I went to these powerful people.

2205
01:04:19,041 --> 01:04:21,230
I went to the UN and I went
to the British government,

2206
01:04:21,250 --> 01:04:22,260
the Ministry of Defense.

2207
01:04:22,710 --> 01:04:23,250
Um,

2208
01:04:23,250 --> 01:04:25,140
and basically none of them doubted.

2209
01:04:25,141 --> 01:04:26,040
This was all true.

2210
01:04:26,220 --> 01:04:27,053
Frankly.

2211
01:04:27,330 --> 01:04:28,740
This is what people need to understand.

2212
01:04:28,770 --> 01:04:30,630
There was no laughter in the room.

2213
01:04:30,950 --> 01:04:32,220
They took it very seriously,

2214
01:04:32,580 --> 01:04:34,470
but they didn't want to
stick their necks out.

2215
01:04:34,471 --> 01:04:35,191
And a friend of mine,

2216
01:04:35,191 --> 01:04:36,270
who's a big business guy,

2217
01:04:36,271 --> 01:04:36,521
he say,

2218
01:04:36,521 --> 01:04:36,840
well,

2219
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:37,673
you know,

2220
01:04:37,860 --> 01:04:38,850
the way the world works now,

2221
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:42,720
everyone wants to be first to be
second when it's something tough.

2222
01:04:42,780 --> 01:04:43,180
Okay.

2223
01:04:43,180 --> 01:04:47,080
I've always felt that something
along the lines of alien contact,

2224
01:04:47,140 --> 01:04:49,720
if they did have information,

2225
01:04:49,721 --> 01:04:54,430
there's no reason to let people
know unless it's unavoidable.

2226
01:04:54,790 --> 01:04:58,870
I always felt like unless they were just
going to try to do some damage control

2227
01:04:58,871 --> 01:05:01,840
and redefine what's happening,

2228
01:05:02,290 --> 01:05:02,680
I didn't,

2229
01:05:02,680 --> 01:05:04,530
I wouldn't think that they
would ever come out about it.

2230
01:05:04,531 --> 01:05:08,740
It just doesn't seem like it would be
something that would be advantageous to

2231
01:05:08,741 --> 01:05:10,370
just start telling people about Ufos.

2232
01:05:10,540 --> 01:05:13,810
Th th the idea is always that the
government is our daddy and then our

2233
01:05:13,811 --> 01:05:14,920
government's looking out for us.

2234
01:05:14,921 --> 01:05:17,550
But the evidence points
time and time again to that,

2235
01:05:17,600 --> 01:05:19,850
that that's horse shit and that's
not really what's going on.

2236
01:05:20,150 --> 01:05:20,421
But you know,

2237
01:05:20,421 --> 01:05:20,911
my military,

2238
01:05:20,911 --> 01:05:20,980
yeah.

2239
01:05:20,980 --> 01:05:24,580
Boys who made the point years
ago that because so many people,

2240
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:27,940
I mean between five and 10% of the
public have seen one of these objects,

2241
01:05:27,941 --> 01:05:28,660
many of them,

2242
01:05:28,660 --> 01:05:29,493
very close range.

2243
01:05:29,500 --> 01:05:33,040
Let's get back to that because this is
what we had talked about before when we

2244
01:05:33,041 --> 01:05:33,760
got onto this.

2245
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:35,770
People think the earth
is 10,000 years old.

2246
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:36,640
Um,

2247
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:39,520
I think most of what
people see is bullshit.

2248
01:05:39,730 --> 01:05:40,720
I think most,

2249
01:05:40,790 --> 01:05:41,390
yeah,

2250
01:05:41,390 --> 01:05:42,430
no question about that.

2251
01:05:42,670 --> 01:05:43,151
Most,

2252
01:05:43,151 --> 01:05:43,450
uh,

2253
01:05:43,450 --> 01:05:44,283
sightings.

2254
01:05:44,300 --> 01:05:45,133
I,

2255
01:05:45,370 --> 01:05:48,430
I did a show once for cvs
called game show in my head,

2256
01:05:48,610 --> 01:05:49,443
and it was a,

2257
01:05:49,950 --> 01:05:52,390
a hidden camera game show.

2258
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:55,240
We'd put it an earpiece in people's
head and we were sending him out to the

2259
01:05:55,241 --> 01:05:56,560
street and a,

2260
01:05:56,561 --> 01:05:58,360
they didn't know what they had
to do until they got there.

2261
01:05:58,361 --> 01:05:59,140
And one of them,

2262
01:05:59,140 --> 01:05:59,591
we said,

2263
01:05:59,591 --> 01:06:00,320
okay,

2264
01:06:00,320 --> 01:06:01,570
see that camera over there?

2265
01:06:01,660 --> 01:06:02,890
That's where that works for you.

2266
01:06:02,891 --> 01:06:03,850
There was a big news camera,

2267
01:06:03,851 --> 01:06:08,851
you're a news reporter and there was
just a Ufo sighting right above Hollywood

2268
01:06:09,821 --> 01:06:10,510
boulevard.

2269
01:06:10,510 --> 01:06:13,030
The problem is the witness took off.

2270
01:06:13,060 --> 01:06:17,560
So you need to grab someone who wasn't
there and have them become a witness.

2271
01:06:17,590 --> 01:06:21,670
Tell them exactly what you need to
tell them to get them to do this,

2272
01:06:21,671 --> 01:06:22,990
get them to lie on camera,

2273
01:06:23,110 --> 01:06:26,800
then you need to get them to tell you
that they were abducted and probe.

2274
01:06:28,180 --> 01:06:30,250
And I'm Sarah and we got
people to do it like that.

2275
01:06:30,310 --> 01:06:30,530
It was,

2276
01:06:30,530 --> 01:06:30,700
yeah,

2277
01:06:30,700 --> 01:06:30,941
no,

2278
01:06:30,941 --> 01:06:31,560
I have no doubt,

2279
01:06:31,560 --> 01:06:33,250
but he was full of shit.

2280
01:06:33,300 --> 01:06:33,400
Yeah,

2281
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:33,851
you can't,

2282
01:06:33,851 --> 01:06:34,810
you can always do that.

2283
01:06:34,811 --> 01:06:37,980
But I'm talking about high
level military and the residual,

2284
01:06:37,981 --> 01:06:38,070
I

2285
01:06:38,070 --> 01:06:38,251
mean,

2286
01:06:38,251 --> 01:06:39,084
for example,

2287
01:06:39,380 --> 01:06:40,213
um,

2288
01:06:40,530 --> 01:06:41,820
we have multiple,

2289
01:06:41,870 --> 01:06:42,090
uh,

2290
01:06:42,090 --> 01:06:42,410
air,

2291
01:06:42,410 --> 01:06:43,243
uh,

2292
01:06:43,260 --> 01:06:45,960
pilots for commercial
airlines and the air force.

2293
01:06:46,430 --> 01:06:46,860
Uh,

2294
01:06:46,860 --> 01:06:49,380
and this is one of the really
great cases we have by the way,

2295
01:06:49,381 --> 01:06:51,900
the Japan Airlines case over Alaska,

2296
01:06:52,220 --> 01:06:52,590
uh,

2297
01:06:52,590 --> 01:06:53,340
in the 80s.

2298
01:06:53,340 --> 01:06:57,180
And the guy who was in charge
of investigations for the FAA,

2299
01:06:57,181 --> 01:07:00,180
he was third from the top
during the Reagan era.

2300
01:07:00,630 --> 01:07:05,630
He actually left that agency and brought
the originals with him and gave them to

2301
01:07:05,940 --> 01:07:10,940
us of the radar tracings of this
thing that was the size of like 10,

2302
01:07:11,011 --> 01:07:11,341
seven,

2303
01:07:11,341 --> 01:07:11,991
47.

2304
01:07:11,991 --> 01:07:14,850
It's moving in a nonlinear
way over the skies.

2305
01:07:15,060 --> 01:07:18,090
It was on civilian radar,

2306
01:07:18,150 --> 01:07:20,250
which way it was on military radar.

2307
01:07:20,520 --> 01:07:22,110
They scrambled f 16 jets.

2308
01:07:22,111 --> 01:07:25,050
It was on their radar
and the Japan Airlines,

2309
01:07:25,051 --> 01:07:28,140
seven 47 pilot has testified to it.

2310
01:07:28,141 --> 01:07:30,240
And we have all of that in this case.

2311
01:07:30,570 --> 01:07:31,403
Heard of this.

2312
01:07:31,530 --> 01:07:31,861
All right.

2313
01:07:31,861 --> 01:07:32,071
So,

2314
01:07:32,071 --> 01:07:34,730
so when we brought all that
forward and this guy came for,

2315
01:07:34,750 --> 01:07:35,041
he says,

2316
01:07:35,041 --> 01:07:38,530
I'm one of these high level government
officials who actually has seen all of

2317
01:07:38,540 --> 01:07:39,990
this and has handled it,

2318
01:07:40,350 --> 01:07:42,360
but no one's asking the right questions.

2319
01:07:42,570 --> 01:07:44,850
So when you pull all that together,

2320
01:07:44,851 --> 01:07:47,490
and then of course there
will be events like the,

2321
01:07:47,491 --> 01:07:49,320
this thing that happened in Phoenix where,

2322
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:49,650
you know,

2323
01:07:49,650 --> 01:07:52,890
eventually the governor of Arizona,

2324
01:07:52,891 --> 01:07:55,560
five Simonton came out later
and at the time he ridiculed it,

2325
01:07:55,890 --> 01:07:57,570
but he had actually
seen it came out later,

2326
01:07:57,571 --> 01:08:00,030
10 years later in 2007 said,

2327
01:08:00,450 --> 01:08:00,900
yeah,

2328
01:08:00,900 --> 01:08:02,670
that was an EDT craft almost certainly.

2329
01:08:02,671 --> 01:08:06,600
And I saw it and tens of thousands of
people in the Phoenix area saw it and it

2330
01:08:06,601 --> 01:08:10,110
was photographed and it was on radar
and there were very trained people.

2331
01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:10,501
So,

2332
01:08:10,501 --> 01:08:10,741
you know,

2333
01:08:10,741 --> 01:08:13,650
you have to ask the question how
many things like that have to happen?

2334
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:14,550
And,

2335
01:08:14,550 --> 01:08:15,383
uh,

2336
01:08:15,450 --> 01:08:15,691
you know,

2337
01:08:15,691 --> 01:08:16,560
on the other hand,

2338
01:08:16,860 --> 01:08:17,191
you know,

2339
01:08:17,191 --> 01:08:18,730
the things that we have in physics,

2340
01:08:18,750 --> 01:08:19,180
uh,

2341
01:08:19,180 --> 01:08:19,590
that are,

2342
01:08:19,590 --> 01:08:21,960
that are inferred through
indirect measurements,

2343
01:08:21,961 --> 01:08:25,920
like black holes or articles that belief
and faith or even the Big Bang theory.

2344
01:08:26,130 --> 01:08:27,330
But when you have all of this,

2345
01:08:27,331 --> 01:08:29,340
and this is not just someone
on Hollywood boulevard,

2346
01:08:29,341 --> 01:08:30,270
he's making stuff up.

2347
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:31,830
We have dozens,

2348
01:08:31,830 --> 01:08:32,191
thousands of people,

2349
01:08:32,191 --> 01:08:33,240
we have radar cases,

2350
01:08:33,241 --> 01:08:34,074
you have all this.

2351
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:36,480
And so a lot of this is what's
going to be in the film serious.

2352
01:08:36,481 --> 01:08:40,410
And because what I said to people is that
the fact that people haven't seen this

2353
01:08:40,411 --> 01:08:40,850
evidence,

2354
01:08:40,850 --> 01:08:42,810
it doesn't mean that it doesn't exist.

2355
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:43,710
It does exist.

2356
01:08:43,710 --> 01:08:44,011
I,

2357
01:08:44,011 --> 01:08:44,360
um,

2358
01:08:44,360 --> 01:08:45,240
and I agree with you.

2359
01:08:45,241 --> 01:08:48,840
There are a lot of people who will see
things and it will be a planet rising or

2360
01:08:48,841 --> 01:08:49,630
it'll be a,

2361
01:08:49,630 --> 01:08:51,920
a meteor or it'll be military aircraft,

2362
01:08:52,020 --> 01:08:53,520
a satellite or it'll be a com.

2363
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:55,350
Now this is the other part of this.

2364
01:08:55,980 --> 01:09:00,000
There are a lot of things that are
Ufo sightings that are very legit.

2365
01:09:00,660 --> 01:09:02,190
And that's why I don't like the word Ufo.

2366
01:09:02,191 --> 01:09:05,370
There are two categories of Ufo shows
that once you eliminate all the nonsense

2367
01:09:05,371 --> 01:09:06,204
you're talking about,

2368
01:09:06,780 --> 01:09:09,270
and they're the ones that are Etvs,

2369
01:09:09,300 --> 01:09:10,021
which is what they're called,

2370
01:09:10,021 --> 01:09:12,060
the NSA extraterrestrial vehicles.

2371
01:09:12,360 --> 01:09:16,050
And then there are the ones that are
the electromagnetic devices we've been

2372
01:09:16,051 --> 01:09:19,110
building since the 50s and um,

2373
01:09:19,210 --> 01:09:19,460
if,

2374
01:09:19,460 --> 01:09:24,240
if people think that propulsion and
energy systems stopped in the forties,

2375
01:09:24,510 --> 01:09:25,770
they need to think about this,

2376
01:09:26,370 --> 01:09:27,480
list it back for a minute.

2377
01:09:27,570 --> 01:09:31,050
Your car is running on an
internal combustion engine circa

2378
01:09:31,460 --> 01:09:32,780
mine is because I'm a man.

2379
01:09:32,810 --> 01:09:33,081
Okay.

2380
01:09:33,081 --> 01:09:35,270
And I don't drive a and sissy hybrid.

2381
01:09:35,300 --> 01:09:35,481
Yeah,

2382
01:09:35,481 --> 01:09:36,290
there you go.

2383
01:09:36,290 --> 01:09:37,340
I'm not driving a Prius.

2384
01:09:37,341 --> 01:09:38,240
It makes no noise.

2385
01:09:38,241 --> 01:09:38,480
Yeah,

2386
01:09:38,480 --> 01:09:40,020
you should have a thousand words power,

2387
01:09:40,430 --> 01:09:41,121
electric one.

2388
01:09:41,121 --> 01:09:43,640
And then you'd really have
some powers is too futuristic,

2389
01:09:43,641 --> 01:09:44,031
man.

2390
01:09:44,031 --> 01:09:45,740
I need led Zeppelin on the radio.

2391
01:09:45,741 --> 01:09:47,840
I need a little seventies in my life.

2392
01:09:48,130 --> 01:09:48,520
Yeah,

2393
01:09:48,520 --> 01:09:48,970
well nobody,

2394
01:09:48,970 --> 01:09:49,481
I mean this,

2395
01:09:49,481 --> 01:09:49,781
you know,

2396
01:09:49,781 --> 01:09:52,570
and the jet engine people think
that we're flying around jet.

2397
01:09:52,571 --> 01:09:53,770
So I came out here from DC,

2398
01:09:54,470 --> 01:09:56,590
that's 1930s rockets,

2399
01:09:56,830 --> 01:09:58,920
1940s for Navon Brown does,

2400
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:02,350
do people really think there've been
no breakthroughs in energy physics?

2401
01:10:02,610 --> 01:10:03,940
Well since the forties,

2402
01:10:04,300 --> 01:10:07,060
people absolutely know that we've
been working on things like that.

2403
01:10:07,061 --> 01:10:10,570
But to bring up what you brought up
earlier about the governor of Phoenix,

2404
01:10:10,810 --> 01:10:12,800
just to point out that
the governor of Alaska,

2405
01:10:13,060 --> 01:10:14,830
Arizona rather the governor of Alaska,

2406
01:10:14,831 --> 01:10:17,470
Sarah Palin was one of those people that
believe the earth is less than 10,000

2407
01:10:17,471 --> 01:10:17,861
years old.

2408
01:10:17,861 --> 01:10:20,800
So just because you're a governor or
something doesn't mean you're on the ball.

2409
01:10:20,980 --> 01:10:21,880
And second of all,

2410
01:10:21,910 --> 01:10:22,240
um,

2411
01:10:22,240 --> 01:10:25,140
I had friends that were in Phoenix and uh,

2412
01:10:25,210 --> 01:10:30,210
one of them very credible guy told me
he saw some giant black triangle flying

2413
01:10:33,311 --> 01:10:34,780
motionless over the sky.

2414
01:10:34,930 --> 01:10:37,480
He said it was bigger than
several football fields.

2415
01:10:37,750 --> 01:10:42,520
He said it made no noise and it blocked
out the the stars and flew over and he

2416
01:10:42,521 --> 01:10:44,620
said everyone in his neighborhood
was shitting their pants.

2417
01:10:45,100 --> 01:10:47,230
It was enough to me that I would go,

2418
01:10:47,231 --> 01:10:47,650
wow,

2419
01:10:47,650 --> 01:10:48,610
there's something.

2420
01:10:48,640 --> 01:10:50,560
There's too many people
that saw something.

2421
01:10:50,670 --> 01:10:51,210
He cute,

2422
01:10:51,210 --> 01:10:53,050
get attribute certain
things to mass hysteria.

2423
01:10:53,320 --> 01:10:56,110
But that was one of them that
I've found to be very strange.

2424
01:10:56,111 --> 01:10:57,910
But I never heard any photographs.

2425
01:10:57,940 --> 01:10:58,790
You say photograph,

2426
01:10:58,830 --> 01:11:00,410
we have amazing photographs and video.

2427
01:11:00,411 --> 01:11:01,330
They're going to be in the film.

2428
01:11:01,331 --> 01:11:01,781
Serious.

2429
01:11:01,781 --> 01:11:02,800
You don't have them anywhere else.

2430
01:11:02,801 --> 01:11:04,330
So I didn't go to see online.

2431
01:11:04,510 --> 01:11:05,343
You're holding them back.

2432
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:05,721
No,

2433
01:11:05,721 --> 01:11:05,841
no,

2434
01:11:05,841 --> 01:11:05,991
no,

2435
01:11:05,991 --> 01:11:06,131
no,

2436
01:11:06,131 --> 01:11:06,341
no,

2437
01:11:06,341 --> 01:11:06,521
no.

2438
01:11:06,521 --> 01:11:06,731
They're,

2439
01:11:06,731 --> 01:11:07,480
they're out there.

2440
01:11:07,480 --> 01:11:10,840
A doctor [inaudible] who's a medical
doctor also took some of them.

2441
01:11:10,841 --> 01:11:11,680
There's other video

2442
01:11:12,220 --> 01:11:14,170
photos of the crafts.

2443
01:11:14,200 --> 01:11:14,471
Yes.

2444
01:11:14,471 --> 01:11:15,550
The actual one.

2445
01:11:15,670 --> 01:11:15,960
Yes.

2446
01:11:15,960 --> 01:11:16,610
So what should we,

2447
01:11:16,610 --> 01:11:20,320
if we want to look for one right now to
put in this show right now we're online.

2448
01:11:20,390 --> 01:11:21,790
Who Does he look for?

2449
01:11:22,270 --> 01:11:23,103
Um,

2450
01:11:23,110 --> 01:11:25,210
I guess you'd go to a Dr.
Lynn [inaudible] side.

2451
01:11:25,230 --> 01:11:25,850
I don't remember.

2452
01:11:25,850 --> 01:11:26,683
I spell her name.

2453
01:11:26,950 --> 01:11:31,000
K.

2454
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:31,000
I.

2455
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:31,000
T.

2456
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:31,000
A.

2457
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:31,000
I.

2458
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:31,000
N.

2459
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:31,000
K.

2460
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:31,000
K.

2461
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:31,000
I.

2462
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:31,000
T.

2463
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:31,001
A.

2464
01:11:31,001 --> 01:11:34,710
I pull that up Brian and see what
image she has Google on there.

2465
01:11:35,380 --> 01:11:37,030
I've never heard that
there's been photographs.

2466
01:11:37,050 --> 01:11:37,630
Oh yeah.

2467
01:11:37,630 --> 01:11:37,920
What,

2468
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:38,920
what does the photo show?

2469
01:11:39,550 --> 01:11:41,520
It shows exactly what people described,

2470
01:11:41,530 --> 01:11:46,530
a formation of lights that were moving
together in a massive sort of the

2471
01:11:46,721 --> 01:11:47,470
formation.

2472
01:11:47,470 --> 01:11:47,741
Right.

2473
01:11:47,741 --> 01:11:51,460
And the government said that those were
flares cause a couple hours later when

2474
01:11:51,461 --> 01:11:53,380
they couldn't contain
the news story on this,

2475
01:11:53,381 --> 01:11:54,460
I was there when this happened.

2476
01:11:54,461 --> 01:11:54,850
By the way,

2477
01:11:54,850 --> 01:11:55,683
you were in Phoenix.

2478
01:11:56,050 --> 01:11:56,870
Did you see it?

2479
01:11:56,870 --> 01:11:57,180
Yeah.

2480
01:11:57,180 --> 01:11:58,013
What'd you see?

2481
01:11:58,300 --> 01:11:58,750
What you,

2482
01:11:58,750 --> 01:12:01,060
what you just described now you when the,

2483
01:12:01,070 --> 01:12:01,903
why was I there?

2484
01:12:02,470 --> 01:12:03,303
Yeah.

2485
01:12:03,310 --> 01:12:05,410
Did you get your spider call to Batman?

2486
01:12:05,440 --> 01:12:05,771
Whatever.

2487
01:12:05,771 --> 01:12:06,530
The fucking,

2488
01:12:06,530 --> 01:12:09,310
the thing that Ufo just
appears over your house,

2489
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:10,480
like the bat sign.

2490
01:12:10,510 --> 01:12:11,590
Remember when he's in trouble,

2491
01:12:11,591 --> 01:12:12,670
we need to send Batman.

2492
01:12:12,830 --> 01:12:13,251
Oh,

2493
01:12:13,251 --> 01:12:13,760
they do?

2494
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:14,031
No,

2495
01:12:14,031 --> 01:12:14,570
they don't.

2496
01:12:14,570 --> 01:12:15,620
I was actually there,

2497
01:12:15,630 --> 01:12:15,860
uh,

2498
01:12:15,860 --> 01:12:19,130
at a digital lab that was being
loaned to us to put together,

2499
01:12:19,340 --> 01:12:20,173
coincidentally,

2500
01:12:20,900 --> 01:12:24,710
we're not coincidentally to put together
the best photos and videos to give to

2501
01:12:24,711 --> 01:12:27,470
Congress that I was briefing
in April of [inaudible] 97.

2502
01:12:27,830 --> 01:12:31,490
So in March of [inaudible] 97 I had
gone there and there was a guy who had a

2503
01:12:31,491 --> 01:12:33,440
digital laboratory who said,

2504
01:12:33,441 --> 01:12:33,651
look,

2505
01:12:33,651 --> 01:12:36,410
we'll let you use Harlow equipment
and assemble this and we'll help you.

2506
01:12:36,830 --> 01:12:37,430
Um,

2507
01:12:37,430 --> 01:12:39,020
and he'd worked a lot with the military.

2508
01:12:39,021 --> 01:12:42,320
And so I had collected photos and videos
from all over the world and governments

2509
01:12:42,321 --> 01:12:43,340
from all over the world,

2510
01:12:43,610 --> 01:12:47,570
which we call the best available evidence
and put what I was putting it together

2511
01:12:47,810 --> 01:12:52,580
because in April we were holding a closed
briefing from members of Congress who

2512
01:12:52,581 --> 01:12:53,414
wanted to know,

2513
01:12:53,660 --> 01:12:55,460
and this when people like
Congressman Dan Burton,

2514
01:12:55,461 --> 01:12:57,860
who was chairman of the House government
reform and Oversight Committee,

2515
01:12:57,861 --> 01:13:01,010
came in a whole lot of other people
from the Pentagon and vice president's

2516
01:13:01,011 --> 01:13:01,970
office and whatnot.

2517
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:02,630
Um,

2518
01:13:02,630 --> 01:13:02,901
and,

2519
01:13:02,901 --> 01:13:03,291
and,

2520
01:13:03,291 --> 01:13:03,441
uh,

2521
01:13:03,441 --> 01:13:07,880
so I was there then when that happened
and someone came running into the lab

2522
01:13:07,881 --> 01:13:08,510
saying,

2523
01:13:08,510 --> 01:13:09,141
my God,

2524
01:13:09,141 --> 01:13:09,950
while we're here trying,

2525
01:13:09,950 --> 01:13:10,330
there's all,

2526
01:13:10,330 --> 01:13:11,630
there's this going on.

2527
01:13:11,810 --> 01:13:14,930
And it turned out it was on
the news that night in Phoenix.

2528
01:13:14,931 --> 01:13:15,051
Now,

2529
01:13:15,051 --> 01:13:15,884
interestingly,

2530
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:16,820
the national news,

2531
01:13:16,821 --> 01:13:18,170
they didn't pick up on it until June.

2532
01:13:18,230 --> 01:13:19,220
This happened in March,

2533
01:13:19,490 --> 01:13:20,480
which is very interesting.

2534
01:13:20,810 --> 01:13:21,643
Um,

2535
01:13:22,280 --> 01:13:23,420
why did that get held back?

2536
01:13:23,720 --> 01:13:24,321
But it,

2537
01:13:24,321 --> 01:13:24,711
you know,

2538
01:13:24,711 --> 01:13:25,660
and so there,

2539
01:13:25,661 --> 01:13:28,280
there are so many people
who saw it and this,

2540
01:13:28,580 --> 01:13:29,420
this was huge.

2541
01:13:29,421 --> 01:13:31,400
Whatever this object was,

2542
01:13:31,401 --> 01:13:33,920
it was not the size of like a seven 47,

2543
01:13:34,160 --> 01:13:34,221
uh,

2544
01:13:34,221 --> 01:13:35,150
seven 47,

2545
01:13:35,180 --> 01:13:35,410
you know,

2546
01:13:35,410 --> 01:13:37,510
you probably could put
dozens of them inside the,

2547
01:13:37,511 --> 01:13:39,050
the volume of this thing.

2548
01:13:39,051 --> 01:13:39,770
It was huge.

2549
01:13:39,770 --> 01:13:42,560
I found it interesting that
the stories were very similar.

2550
01:13:42,710 --> 01:13:44,300
So one of the things that
I found most interesting,

2551
01:13:44,510 --> 01:13:45,140
I uh,

2552
01:13:45,140 --> 01:13:48,290
watched some stuff online and then
when I spoke to my friend who lives in

2553
01:13:48,291 --> 01:13:50,190
Phoenix and he told me what he saw,

2554
01:13:50,191 --> 01:13:50,421
I was like,

2555
01:13:50,421 --> 01:13:50,710
wow,

2556
01:13:50,710 --> 01:13:54,320
you're talking about like at least six
or seven people that tell them the exact

2557
01:13:54,321 --> 01:13:57,170
same story of seeing this
exact same sort of thing.

2558
01:13:57,440 --> 01:13:59,630
Now these are the images
that you're talking about.

2559
01:13:59,631 --> 01:14:00,620
These are the,

2560
01:14:00,621 --> 01:14:01,070
just the,

2561
01:14:01,070 --> 01:14:01,731
the whatever,

2562
01:14:01,731 --> 01:14:03,200
the red lights that are in the sky.

2563
01:14:03,950 --> 01:14:06,170
I think the video is
probably more impressive.

2564
01:14:06,530 --> 01:14:06,890
Uh,

2565
01:14:06,890 --> 01:14:10,790
being that the video shows these things
essentially hover for a long period of

2566
01:14:10,791 --> 01:14:15,791
time and a much longer than really
should be attributable to parachutes and

2567
01:14:17,911 --> 01:14:18,744
flares.

2568
01:14:18,980 --> 01:14:21,600
It doesn't really make any sense
cause parachutes and flares.

2569
01:14:21,720 --> 01:14:23,040
They don't really move that slow.

2570
01:14:23,041 --> 01:14:23,371
When you,

2571
01:14:23,371 --> 01:14:23,581
you know,

2572
01:14:23,581 --> 01:14:24,750
you watch a guy jumped out of a,

2573
01:14:24,751 --> 01:14:25,310
um,

2574
01:14:25,310 --> 01:14:26,040
uh,

2575
01:14:26,040 --> 01:14:27,630
a plane with a parachute,

2576
01:14:27,980 --> 01:14:28,610
the parachute.

2577
01:14:28,610 --> 01:14:29,111
So you know,

2578
01:14:29,111 --> 01:14:29,291
they,

2579
01:14:29,291 --> 01:14:30,150
they s drive,

2580
01:14:30,151 --> 01:14:31,290
they slow your fall down,

2581
01:14:31,291 --> 01:14:32,610
but they don't make you suspect.

2582
01:14:33,260 --> 01:14:33,770
No.

2583
01:14:33,770 --> 01:14:34,720
And we know,

2584
01:14:34,740 --> 01:14:37,820
we know how those kind
of flares occur mean,

2585
01:14:38,060 --> 01:14:40,430
but the people who were directly under it,

2586
01:14:40,550 --> 01:14:42,590
and it moved not just
over this part of Phoenix,

2587
01:14:42,591 --> 01:14:46,400
it moved all the way from outside
Flagstaff through the valley and then down

2588
01:14:46,401 --> 01:14:47,420
towards Tempe.

2589
01:14:47,490 --> 01:14:48,570
Now how did you do about it?

2590
01:14:48,600 --> 01:14:49,620
You were there working.

2591
01:14:49,621 --> 01:14:50,470
Did you hear about it?

2592
01:14:50,471 --> 01:14:51,090
Did you,

2593
01:14:51,090 --> 01:14:55,170
there was a guy that ran into the lab
and who had actually been in the military

2594
01:14:55,171 --> 01:14:56,880
so you wouldn't believe what's going on.

2595
01:14:57,270 --> 01:14:57,810
So,

2596
01:14:57,810 --> 01:14:58,560
um,

2597
01:14:58,560 --> 01:14:58,861
so yeah,

2598
01:14:58,861 --> 01:15:02,550
I was there that night and 1997,

2599
01:15:02,940 --> 01:15:03,990
March of [inaudible] 97.

2600
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:04,290
Yeah.

2601
01:15:04,290 --> 01:15:04,660
Now,

2602
01:15:04,660 --> 01:15:05,790
what's equally interesting,

2603
01:15:05,791 --> 01:15:06,690
if you look at this now,

2604
01:15:06,691 --> 01:15:09,090
the Bill Jin Air Force
cooperated with me very,

2605
01:15:09,210 --> 01:15:13,110
very nicely back in the early
nineties and late eighties.

2606
01:15:13,111 --> 01:15:17,370
You may have remembered there was this a
wave of things that happened in eastern

2607
01:15:17,371 --> 01:15:20,430
Belgium where there were these
massive triangles that were about,

2608
01:15:20,480 --> 01:15:21,270
uh,

2609
01:15:21,270 --> 01:15:26,270
800 feet on each side that
were photographed radar
traced chase by f sixteens

2610
01:15:29,670 --> 01:15:30,031
and on the,

2611
01:15:30,031 --> 01:15:34,350
and we have all this and the head of the
Belgian air force actually showed the

2612
01:15:34,351 --> 01:15:39,351
radar of one of these objects going
from hover to several thousand miles per

2613
01:15:39,361 --> 01:15:39,721
hour,

2614
01:15:39,721 --> 01:15:41,310
straight up into space,

2615
01:15:41,460 --> 01:15:45,190
way outside the envelope of any
normal conventional propulsion system,

2616
01:15:45,191 --> 01:15:45,640
the video,

2617
01:15:45,640 --> 01:15:48,230
this radar radar radar of it.

2618
01:15:48,230 --> 01:15:48,481
And we,

2619
01:15:48,481 --> 01:15:49,051
and we have that.

2620
01:15:49,051 --> 01:15:49,620
So you know,

2621
01:15:49,620 --> 01:15:53,460
the question becomes how many of these
cases do you need to have before you say

2622
01:15:53,461 --> 01:15:54,480
there's something out there.

2623
01:15:54,960 --> 01:15:55,461
And,

2624
01:15:55,461 --> 01:15:57,130
and I think this is what I,

2625
01:15:57,670 --> 01:15:59,940
the problem is that on this subject,

2626
01:16:00,690 --> 01:16:05,580
the ridicule around it and that the
disinformation and the crazy stories that

2627
01:16:05,581 --> 01:16:09,780
are out there is what dominates
the serious pun intended.

2628
01:16:09,781 --> 01:16:14,520
Perhaps the serious stuff really gets
left on the cutting room floor by most

2629
01:16:14,521 --> 01:16:17,850
movie directors and media
and even on the Internet.

2630
01:16:17,851 --> 01:16:18,684
It's very hard.

2631
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:20,340
And I think the pick your way through.

2632
01:16:20,341 --> 01:16:22,710
It's very difficult what I've tried to do.

2633
01:16:22,740 --> 01:16:24,570
And then it's not that I've
done a perfect job of it.

2634
01:16:24,571 --> 01:16:26,250
I've done the best I
can with a lot of help.

2635
01:16:26,670 --> 01:16:27,001
Um,

2636
01:16:27,001 --> 01:16:27,511
but remember,

2637
01:16:27,511 --> 01:16:28,440
we've never been funded.

2638
01:16:28,441 --> 01:16:29,880
We're all volunteer effort.

2639
01:16:30,050 --> 01:16:30,883
Um,

2640
01:16:31,350 --> 01:16:36,120
and so what we've tried to do is get
people who have the really good stuff from

2641
01:16:36,121 --> 01:16:38,250
governments come forward and share it.

2642
01:16:38,430 --> 01:16:39,001
And this is why,

2643
01:16:39,001 --> 01:16:39,271
you know,

2644
01:16:39,271 --> 01:16:43,830
when the Space Agency of France
released a lot of their documents,

2645
01:16:43,860 --> 01:16:43,980
uh,

2646
01:16:43,980 --> 01:16:44,850
after I,

2647
01:16:44,930 --> 01:16:49,790
I was having some meetings in
France and with some of the seniors,

2648
01:16:49,800 --> 01:16:52,570
can't say it both ways
to the France of France.

2649
01:16:54,540 --> 01:16:55,710
It was France when I was there.

2650
01:16:55,800 --> 01:16:56,341
And when it's here,

2651
01:16:56,341 --> 01:16:57,040
it's France.

2652
01:16:57,040 --> 01:16:57,421
There you go.

2653
01:16:57,421 --> 01:16:57,790
And you know,

2654
01:16:57,790 --> 01:16:59,010
there's an admiral that,

2655
01:16:59,100 --> 01:17:03,660
that works with us in France
who's a wonderful guy.

2656
01:17:04,020 --> 01:17:04,620
And,

2657
01:17:04,620 --> 01:17:05,100
um,

2658
01:17:05,100 --> 01:17:07,710
he's an MD and a phd in an Amaryl and,

2659
01:17:07,711 --> 01:17:08,550
and you know,

2660
01:17:08,551 --> 01:17:10,640
he knows all this is very real.

2661
01:17:10,641 --> 01:17:11,050
And,

2662
01:17:11,050 --> 01:17:13,190
and so eventually the
French government really,

2663
01:17:13,191 --> 01:17:15,890
I believe it was about a hundred
thousand pages of documents.

2664
01:17:16,310 --> 01:17:17,450
I'm on all of this.

2665
01:17:17,451 --> 01:17:17,651
And,

2666
01:17:17,651 --> 01:17:17,951
and,

2667
01:17:17,951 --> 01:17:18,441
and now,

2668
01:17:18,441 --> 01:17:18,531
uh,

2669
01:17:18,531 --> 01:17:21,560
since the disclosure project
launched it 10 or 12 years ago,

2670
01:17:21,890 --> 01:17:24,560
there are 14 countries
who've opened up their files.

2671
01:17:24,561 --> 01:17:24,801
Now,

2672
01:17:24,801 --> 01:17:24,981
Chris,

2673
01:17:24,981 --> 01:17:28,310
the United States isn't because the
United States is managed differently.

2674
01:17:28,750 --> 01:17:29,420
Um,

2675
01:17:29,420 --> 01:17:30,110
on this issue.

2676
01:17:30,110 --> 01:17:31,110
It's a compartment.

2677
01:17:31,111 --> 01:17:34,900
It unacknowledged for Soviet Union
has actually been pretty open more,

2678
01:17:34,910 --> 01:17:38,600
more recently in more recent
times about the first fell apart.

2679
01:17:38,630 --> 01:17:39,590
Not so much now,

2680
01:17:39,890 --> 01:17:41,150
but when it first fell apart.

2681
01:17:41,151 --> 01:17:41,610
We have a,

2682
01:17:41,610 --> 01:17:46,610
have a great dossier of KGB cases
and files and also military.

2683
01:17:46,930 --> 01:17:47,721
And in fact,

2684
01:17:47,721 --> 01:17:48,500
uh,

2685
01:17:48,500 --> 01:17:48,710
uh,

2686
01:17:48,710 --> 01:17:51,950
some of the cosmonauts that
had had encounters with these,

2687
01:17:51,951 --> 01:17:56,951
I pulled together in 1995 for a meeting
with some of our astronauts like Edgar

2688
01:17:57,290 --> 01:17:57,620
Mitchell,

2689
01:17:57,620 --> 01:17:58,040
um,

2690
01:17:58,040 --> 01:17:59,930
to have a meeting out here in California.

2691
01:17:59,960 --> 01:18:00,710
Um,

2692
01:18:00,710 --> 01:18:01,101
so,

2693
01:18:01,101 --> 01:18:01,630
you know,

2694
01:18:01,630 --> 01:18:02,120
there were some,

2695
01:18:02,120 --> 01:18:07,120
some really solid cases out of the Soviet
Union or Mitchell claim to have had a

2696
01:18:07,491 --> 01:18:08,360
personal experience.

2697
01:18:08,390 --> 01:18:08,780
No,

2698
01:18:08,780 --> 01:18:08,991
no,

2699
01:18:08,991 --> 01:18:13,370
he's just investigated it and has
concluded that this is all very real.

2700
01:18:13,371 --> 01:18:13,681
And he,

2701
01:18:13,681 --> 01:18:14,150
he,

2702
01:18:14,150 --> 01:18:15,080
he did come with me.

2703
01:18:15,081 --> 01:18:16,220
I invited him to the briefing.

2704
01:18:16,221 --> 01:18:19,150
We set up for the head of intelligence
for the Joint Chiefs of Staff,

2705
01:18:19,170 --> 01:18:20,003
the Pentagon.

2706
01:18:20,180 --> 01:18:20,930
Um,

2707
01:18:20,930 --> 01:18:24,440
and I think it was a very interesting for
him to have learned that the people at

2708
01:18:24,441 --> 01:18:29,330
that level were shaken to
their foundations because
they concluded this was all

2709
01:18:29,331 --> 01:18:29,960
real.

2710
01:18:29,960 --> 01:18:31,130
But when they made inquiries,

2711
01:18:31,131 --> 01:18:32,930
they were being lied to and denied access.

2712
01:18:33,200 --> 01:18:33,891
And so this,

2713
01:18:33,891 --> 01:18:35,210
this brings up this question,

2714
01:18:36,160 --> 01:18:36,950
how to,

2715
01:18:36,950 --> 01:18:38,060
who's running this show?

2716
01:18:38,350 --> 01:18:38,560
And,

2717
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:40,430
and who's over who the Fox is a garden,

2718
01:18:40,431 --> 01:18:41,264
the hen house,

2719
01:18:41,270 --> 01:18:41,751
and I,

2720
01:18:41,751 --> 01:18:42,810
and this is exactly,

2721
01:18:42,811 --> 01:18:44,480
it goes back to Eisenhower's warning,

2722
01:18:44,750 --> 01:18:45,660
but you know,

2723
01:18:45,700 --> 01:18:47,990
we're 50 years into that era now.

2724
01:18:48,140 --> 01:18:49,850
And so half a century later,

2725
01:18:50,380 --> 01:18:55,040
as big of a screw up as it was in 1961
when Eisenhower warned us about it,

2726
01:18:55,320 --> 01:18:57,050
it's 10 times worse than that now.

2727
01:18:57,220 --> 01:18:57,490
And,

2728
01:18:57,490 --> 01:19:02,490
and so much so that I have concluded that
the way we change the dynamic on this

2729
01:19:03,081 --> 01:19:04,160
is that the people lead,

2730
01:19:04,161 --> 01:19:05,240
the leaders will have to follow.

2731
01:19:05,390 --> 01:19:06,770
We do the disclosure,

2732
01:19:06,920 --> 01:19:08,570
we bring out these technologies,

2733
01:19:08,720 --> 01:19:10,580
we set up teams to make contact,

2734
01:19:10,581 --> 01:19:12,230
and we just bypass the government.

2735
01:19:13,130 --> 01:19:15,500
The evidence that you have this,

2736
01:19:15,501 --> 01:19:15,660
uh,

2737
01:19:15,660 --> 01:19:17,480
or possible evidence of this,

2738
01:19:17,481 --> 01:19:17,680
uh,

2739
01:19:17,680 --> 01:19:19,820
alien life before that,

2740
01:19:20,030 --> 01:19:21,150
this is a more recent thing.

2741
01:19:21,151 --> 01:19:22,130
This is fairly recent,

2742
01:19:22,131 --> 01:19:22,520
right?

2743
01:19:22,520 --> 01:19:23,271
Before that,

2744
01:19:23,271 --> 01:19:25,700
what was the most compelling piece
of physical evidence that you've ever

2745
01:19:25,701 --> 01:19:26,534
encountered?

2746
01:19:27,680 --> 01:19:29,350
I would have to say that it's the,

2747
01:19:29,380 --> 01:19:33,680
it's these really well documented
complex cases that involve,

2748
01:19:33,980 --> 01:19:34,520
uh,

2749
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:35,390
documents,

2750
01:19:35,450 --> 01:19:40,450
radar cases with photographs and multiple
corroborating credible witnesses such

2751
01:19:40,461 --> 01:19:41,210
as playlists,

2752
01:19:41,210 --> 01:19:42,410
landing sites.

2753
01:19:43,380 --> 01:19:43,641
We do,

2754
01:19:43,641 --> 01:19:44,301
and I actually,

2755
01:19:44,301 --> 01:19:44,520
uh,

2756
01:19:44,520 --> 01:19:48,200
we have been given materials from where
the sites of land in delivery anomalous.

2757
01:19:48,201 --> 01:19:48,570
Uh,

2758
01:19:48,570 --> 01:19:52,700
what a great case that's in the French
files that they released in the Japan was

2759
01:19:52,701 --> 01:19:55,220
a coach Japan this through
space agency like NASA,

2760
01:19:55,700 --> 01:19:56,090
um,

2761
01:19:56,090 --> 01:19:59,780
release was the pro bono case of 1981,

2762
01:19:59,781 --> 01:20:00,614
I believe,

2763
01:20:00,620 --> 01:20:05,220
when a one of these objects landed
in a lavender field of all places.

2764
01:20:05,221 --> 01:20:06,470
So we're blessed to smelled.

2765
01:20:06,471 --> 01:20:06,960
Awesome.

2766
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:07,440
Yeah,

2767
01:20:07,440 --> 01:20:11,430
well everyone's a commercial
lavender farm and I'm so cool.

2768
01:20:11,610 --> 01:20:12,180
Um,

2769
01:20:12,180 --> 01:20:14,430
and it was wee hours in the
morning and this thing lands,

2770
01:20:14,431 --> 01:20:16,110
the farmer comes out and,

2771
01:20:16,111 --> 01:20:16,350
uh,

2772
01:20:16,350 --> 01:20:17,183
is this,

2773
01:20:17,250 --> 01:20:17,760
uh,

2774
01:20:17,760 --> 01:20:19,170
disc shaped craft hold?

2775
01:20:19,180 --> 01:20:20,013
Um,

2776
01:20:20,160 --> 01:20:20,430
uh,

2777
01:20:20,430 --> 01:20:20,630
I,

2778
01:20:20,630 --> 01:20:25,050
I think it was in the 50 foot diameter
range and there were these little beans

2779
01:20:25,051 --> 01:20:26,520
outside picking lavender.

2780
01:20:26,550 --> 01:20:27,810
Now this sounds crazy,

2781
01:20:27,811 --> 01:20:28,570
like a amount of science

2782
01:20:28,570 --> 01:20:28,910
fiction.

2783
01:20:28,910 --> 01:20:30,340
How little like you're a little guy.

2784
01:20:30,540 --> 01:20:30,980
No,

2785
01:20:30,980 --> 01:20:31,140
no.

2786
01:20:31,140 --> 01:20:31,973
These are

2787
01:20:32,180 --> 01:20:34,100
from what I remember like four feet,

2788
01:20:34,130 --> 01:20:36,390
five feet in that range and then it,

2789
01:20:36,500 --> 01:20:40,280
but it left this spot
where it hit landed and it,

2790
01:20:40,310 --> 01:20:41,390
there were anomalies,

2791
01:20:41,391 --> 01:20:42,290
electromagnetic,

2792
01:20:42,650 --> 01:20:42,741
uh,

2793
01:20:42,741 --> 01:20:43,400
sort of,

2794
01:20:43,400 --> 01:20:43,670
uh,

2795
01:20:43,670 --> 01:20:45,140
radiation into the soil.

2796
01:20:45,320 --> 01:20:47,990
And this was actually studied
by the French government,

2797
01:20:48,170 --> 01:20:50,240
occluded to be an absolutely real case,

2798
01:20:50,241 --> 01:20:51,530
just like the bent waters,

2799
01:20:51,950 --> 01:20:56,950
Royal Air Force Base case in England was
determined to be an authentic case of a

2800
01:20:57,141 --> 01:20:57,950
landing.

2801
01:20:57,950 --> 01:21:02,950
So these sort of landing cases
that have also now at the time,

2802
01:21:03,460 --> 01:21:04,160
um,

2803
01:21:04,160 --> 01:21:05,630
there weren't many people coming forward.

2804
01:21:05,631 --> 01:21:08,570
Now we have all these military
people coming forward corroborating.

2805
01:21:08,571 --> 01:21:09,081
They were there,

2806
01:21:09,081 --> 01:21:12,800
they saw this and now the documents are
getting released from the UK and France.

2807
01:21:13,400 --> 01:21:15,500
But in the United States
it's still a black hole.

2808
01:21:16,260 --> 01:21:17,340
Now we're going to play your,

2809
01:21:17,480 --> 01:21:20,910
your trailer for the upcoming film series.

2810
01:21:20,911 --> 01:21:21,490
You got to pull that.

2811
01:21:21,490 --> 01:21:22,323
Brian,

2812
01:21:22,620 --> 01:21:23,310
is it cute?

2813
01:21:23,310 --> 01:21:28,050
All the way through because I know we
said 2012 with the world still burning oil

2814
01:21:28,051 --> 01:21:29,160
and gas and coal.

2815
01:21:29,460 --> 01:21:34,260
When we have had all the information
we need to have had a completely new

2816
01:21:34,261 --> 01:21:35,094
civilization.

2817
01:21:36,940 --> 01:21:39,580
Dr. Steven Greer is an absolutely hero

2818
01:21:40,030 --> 01:21:41,270
and the councils of government.

2819
01:21:41,810 --> 01:21:46,810
We must guard against the acquisition of
unwarranted influence whether sought by

2820
01:21:48,171 --> 01:21:50,180
the military industrial complex,

2821
01:21:51,010 --> 01:21:51,470
you know,

2822
01:21:51,470 --> 01:21:55,120
hundreds of billions of dollars
public of the little noise.

2823
01:21:55,570 --> 01:21:56,211
All right,

2824
01:21:56,211 --> 01:21:57,230
sit down and shut up.

2825
01:22:05,860 --> 01:22:07,340
I was told to talk not to listen.

2826
01:22:07,820 --> 01:22:08,810
I'm learning to listen.

2827
01:22:09,090 --> 01:22:14,090
The primary purpose is to train people
to understand these other civilizations

2828
01:22:14,381 --> 01:22:15,220
and their cultures.

2829
01:22:15,340 --> 01:22:17,980
I don't give a God damn what
anyone else says about it.

2830
01:22:18,040 --> 01:22:22,480
I saw that like who do you fel without
them looking at you like you ain't

2831
01:22:22,481 --> 01:22:26,600
wrapped too tight and I was a part of
the United States air force cover up for

2832
01:22:26,601 --> 01:22:27,434
18 years.

2833
01:22:28,770 --> 01:22:33,610
What we are attempting to achieve as a
device which the foods the perpendicular

2834
01:22:33,700 --> 01:22:34,810
force of gravity,

2835
01:22:35,080 --> 01:22:36,190
when we look at our data,

2836
01:22:36,250 --> 01:22:38,620
we lost 7% the weight.

2837
01:22:39,370 --> 01:22:42,130
We now have the technology
to take the t home.

2838
01:22:42,430 --> 01:22:45,730
The consciousness is at once the most
familiar thing to us and the most

2839
01:22:45,731 --> 01:22:46,564
mysterious.

2840
01:22:46,750 --> 01:22:48,010
It doesn't take much effort.

2841
01:22:48,310 --> 01:22:49,330
Did you just clear your mind?

2842
01:22:49,870 --> 01:22:52,030
People are afraid of
looking at technology.

2843
01:22:52,420 --> 01:22:55,290
All Brown stuff got basically
suppressed for many years.

2844
01:22:55,460 --> 01:22:56,293
Can you got murdered?

2845
01:22:57,430 --> 01:23:02,140
Problem is not proving that you oppose
exists is when you begin to expose the

2846
01:23:02,141 --> 01:23:05,880
energy and propulsion system
behind how they're getting here.

2847
01:23:22,900 --> 01:23:23,733
Wow.

2848
01:23:30,090 --> 01:23:31,320
That little thing freaked me out.

2849
01:23:32,360 --> 01:23:33,193
Yeah.

2850
01:23:33,240 --> 01:23:33,451
Well,

2851
01:23:33,451 --> 01:23:34,190
you know,

2852
01:23:34,190 --> 01:23:35,520
I don't mean to sound callous,

2853
01:23:35,521 --> 01:23:36,090
but being a,

2854
01:23:36,090 --> 01:23:36,330
you know,

2855
01:23:36,330 --> 01:23:36,781
doctor,

2856
01:23:36,781 --> 01:23:37,950
I've seen so many worse things,

2857
01:23:37,951 --> 01:23:39,040
but it's actually fascinating.

2858
01:23:39,080 --> 01:23:39,751
Fascinating.

2859
01:23:39,751 --> 01:23:41,880
I mean freak me out and
not that it's a dead body.

2860
01:23:41,890 --> 01:23:42,980
I've seen things.

2861
01:23:43,680 --> 01:23:45,980
It freaked me out that that
might be a life form by the way.

2862
01:23:46,020 --> 01:23:47,010
He was a life form.

2863
01:23:47,011 --> 01:23:49,200
We know for a fact it was
a life form what it was,

2864
01:23:49,201 --> 01:23:50,040
what we're investigating.

2865
01:23:50,250 --> 01:23:50,910
And I think that,

2866
01:23:50,910 --> 01:23:51,690
you know,

2867
01:23:51,690 --> 01:23:51,930
you know,

2868
01:23:51,930 --> 01:23:54,330
one of our witnesses who
was on a retrieval team,

2869
01:23:54,360 --> 01:23:55,193
um,

2870
01:23:55,550 --> 01:23:56,310
uh,

2871
01:23:56,310 --> 01:24:00,630
of retrieving extra terrestrial bodies
from craft that we had targeted,

2872
01:24:00,660 --> 01:24:01,493
um,

2873
01:24:01,590 --> 01:24:02,250
uh,

2874
01:24:02,250 --> 01:24:02,520
you know,

2875
01:24:02,520 --> 01:24:05,160
was talking about the fact that there
are many different species that had been

2876
01:24:05,161 --> 01:24:06,420
cataloged over the years.

2877
01:24:06,421 --> 01:24:06,600
And,

2878
01:24:06,600 --> 01:24:07,440
and at one point,

2879
01:24:07,441 --> 01:24:08,640
I think it was in the late sixties,

2880
01:24:09,110 --> 01:24:12,600
there were like 68 or 69
or something in that range.

2881
01:24:12,960 --> 01:24:13,380
Um,

2882
01:24:13,380 --> 01:24:13,970
you know,

2883
01:24:13,970 --> 01:24:14,190
uh,

2884
01:24:14,190 --> 01:24:16,290
if you look at space
and look at the stars,

2885
01:24:16,950 --> 01:24:19,590
probably every stable star
system has planets around it.

2886
01:24:19,591 --> 01:24:19,791
They're,

2887
01:24:19,791 --> 01:24:20,610
they're discovering.

2888
01:24:20,610 --> 01:24:24,870
And there's the likelihood that there's
an enormous diversity of life out there

2889
01:24:24,940 --> 01:24:25,391
is,

2890
01:24:25,391 --> 01:24:27,240
it's a statistical certainty,

2891
01:24:27,620 --> 01:24:27,810
uh,

2892
01:24:27,810 --> 01:24:29,680
even the conventional astronomers and,

2893
01:24:29,681 --> 01:24:30,051
and,

2894
01:24:30,051 --> 01:24:30,460
and,

2895
01:24:30,460 --> 01:24:30,610
uh,

2896
01:24:30,610 --> 01:24:31,470
the Drake formula.

2897
01:24:31,480 --> 01:24:32,313
What support that?

2898
01:24:32,790 --> 01:24:34,050
The question is,

2899
01:24:34,051 --> 01:24:34,320
you know,

2900
01:24:34,320 --> 01:24:35,071
have they gotten here?

2901
01:24:35,071 --> 01:24:35,251
Well,

2902
01:24:35,251 --> 01:24:36,740
your most probably wouldn't be able to.

2903
01:24:36,741 --> 01:24:39,420
It's just like we weren't for
thousands and thousands of years,

2904
01:24:39,810 --> 01:24:40,360
but is there,

2905
01:24:40,360 --> 01:24:42,240
there's such Hubris to think that,

2906
01:24:42,270 --> 01:24:42,721
you know,

2907
01:24:42,721 --> 01:24:47,260
we're at the pinnacle of the technology
on earth in 2013 and we're not.

2908
01:24:47,610 --> 01:24:48,590
And I think that the,

2909
01:24:48,600 --> 01:24:49,291
and I think that,

2910
01:24:49,291 --> 01:24:49,530
you know,

2911
01:24:49,530 --> 01:24:52,710
when you begin to look at the progression
of technology once you reach him or

2912
01:24:52,711 --> 01:24:55,440
breakout point as we have
in the last century here,

2913
01:24:55,890 --> 01:24:56,723
in fact,

2914
01:24:56,820 --> 01:24:59,160
most of the big breakthroughs
in technologies,

2915
01:24:59,400 --> 01:25:00,390
no one knows about.

2916
01:25:00,990 --> 01:25:01,890
They exist,

2917
01:25:02,160 --> 01:25:03,420
but they're in a classified project.

2918
01:25:03,750 --> 01:25:04,350
And that's,

2919
01:25:04,350 --> 01:25:08,610
I think as big or a bigger story than
the [inaudible] story is the fact that

2920
01:25:08,611 --> 01:25:09,910
there is a cabal of,

2921
01:25:09,970 --> 01:25:10,170
of,

2922
01:25:10,170 --> 01:25:10,711
as I said,

2923
01:25:10,711 --> 01:25:15,711
sociopathic misanthropic folks who have
decided they're macro economic grip on

2924
01:25:16,081 --> 01:25:21,081
power needs to be maintained through
this sort of ruthless secrecy and where

2925
01:25:21,541 --> 01:25:24,570
they keep from the
public this information,

2926
01:25:24,750 --> 01:25:27,750
not because they think people are going
to hurl themselves off the Brooklyn

2927
01:25:27,750 --> 01:25:29,370
Bridge because we're not
alone in the universe.

2928
01:25:29,610 --> 01:25:32,730
But because when this comes out
and this information comes out,

2929
01:25:33,090 --> 01:25:37,410
it means that the sciences already exist
so that we can get off oil and gas and

2930
01:25:37,411 --> 01:25:37,920
coal.

2931
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:40,070
And you know what a
Goldman Sachs guy said,

2932
01:25:40,071 --> 01:25:44,490
that's a $600 trillion not you're
cracking right there trillion.

2933
01:25:44,850 --> 01:25:47,250
And because if you look at
all the oil in the ground,

2934
01:25:47,251 --> 01:25:48,120
the coal in the ground,

2935
01:25:48,121 --> 01:25:49,110
the commodities trading,

2936
01:25:49,111 --> 01:25:50,430
the petrodollar system,

2937
01:25:50,730 --> 01:25:51,511
the utilities,

2938
01:25:51,511 --> 01:25:52,830
the internal combustion engines,

2939
01:25:53,040 --> 01:25:54,510
all of that is defunct,

2940
01:25:54,570 --> 01:25:56,460
extinct stuff or should be.

2941
01:25:56,910 --> 01:25:59,520
And so here we are
cannibalizing this planet,

2942
01:26:00,030 --> 01:26:00,863
um,

2943
01:26:00,930 --> 01:26:05,130
for no good reason except that there's
a of folks and you look at the,

2944
01:26:05,330 --> 01:26:05,690
the,

2945
01:26:05,690 --> 01:26:08,600
the sort of centralization of wealth
and power there is in the world now.

2946
01:26:08,601 --> 01:26:11,600
It's the most extreme it's ever
been in human history right now,

2947
01:26:11,780 --> 01:26:12,613
right this minute,

2948
01:26:12,620 --> 01:26:13,453
this incident.

2949
01:26:13,730 --> 01:26:14,563
So,

2950
01:26:14,750 --> 01:26:15,440
you know,

2951
01:26:15,440 --> 01:26:19,520
there's 200 to 300 individuals and
corporations that have over half the net

2952
01:26:19,521 --> 01:26:20,354
worth of the world.

2953
01:26:20,430 --> 01:26:24,150
You know the guy in the beginning of your
video that says that you're a genius,

2954
01:26:24,960 --> 01:26:25,830
David Wilcock.

2955
01:26:25,950 --> 01:26:26,783
Do you know who that guy is?

2956
01:26:27,140 --> 01:26:27,973
I know who he is.

2957
01:26:28,230 --> 01:26:32,010
Do you know that he also thinks that he's
Edgar Casey reincarnated and shows you

2958
01:26:32,011 --> 01:26:32,660
pictures of,

2959
01:26:32,660 --> 01:26:33,630
I have no idea.

2960
01:26:33,631 --> 01:26:34,470
That's news to me.

2961
01:26:34,570 --> 01:26:38,790
You're Casey's friends and how his
friends look like Edgar Casey's friends.

2962
01:26:39,150 --> 01:26:40,530
You ever watched any
of that guy's lectures?

2963
01:26:40,620 --> 01:26:40,951
No,

2964
01:26:40,951 --> 01:26:41,784
I haven't.

2965
01:26:41,820 --> 01:26:42,121
Yeah,

2966
01:26:42,121 --> 01:26:43,980
I mean some of the team interviewed him,

2967
01:26:43,981 --> 01:26:45,540
but I don't want to do it a little louder.

2968
01:26:45,550 --> 01:26:47,340
They might want to do a little of,

2969
01:26:47,360 --> 01:26:48,193
and with that one,

2970
01:26:48,220 --> 01:26:51,060
I'm not saying that anything else
in your documentary is bullshit,

2971
01:26:51,061 --> 01:26:54,480
but that guy makes my
radar detector go off.

2972
01:26:55,290 --> 01:26:56,123
Um,

2973
01:26:56,250 --> 01:26:57,083
the,

2974
01:26:57,150 --> 01:26:59,760
the evidence that this,

2975
01:26:59,820 --> 01:27:00,031
uh,

2976
01:27:00,031 --> 01:27:02,730
this technology has been suppressed.

2977
01:27:02,880 --> 01:27:03,630
Is there,

2978
01:27:03,630 --> 01:27:08,630
is there evidence that that like
this free energy technology has been,

2979
01:27:09,890 --> 01:27:13,380
there's a huge amount of evidence and
you reveal this in this documentary

2980
01:27:13,610 --> 01:27:14,750
whole document trail.

2981
01:27:15,050 --> 01:27:19,550
And one of the things we got some years
ago was a demand from the Department of

2982
01:27:19,550 --> 01:27:23,450
Defense to the FBI that they turn over
the secret papers of Nikola Tesla that

2983
01:27:23,451 --> 01:27:24,284
were stolen.

2984
01:27:24,590 --> 01:27:26,720
And we have this document and um,

2985
01:27:27,080 --> 01:27:27,351
you know,

2986
01:27:27,351 --> 01:27:29,870
what happened to them and
what were they trying to hide?

2987
01:27:30,200 --> 01:27:30,770
Um,

2988
01:27:30,770 --> 01:27:32,930
the Federation of American scientists,

2989
01:27:32,931 --> 01:27:37,931
a very big mainstream organization in
Washington that has a national security,

2990
01:27:38,060 --> 01:27:38,360
uh,

2991
01:27:38,360 --> 01:27:42,860
research project associated with the
Federation of American scientists came out

2992
01:27:42,861 --> 01:27:46,040
about two years ago with a
report that there were 5,000,

2993
01:27:46,280 --> 01:27:51,200
135 patents that had been seized
under the National Security Act.

2994
01:27:51,560 --> 01:27:54,410
And that some of these
things were energy related.

2995
01:27:54,411 --> 01:27:57,650
One of them in 1971 was only a,

2996
01:27:57,700 --> 01:27:58,010
uh,

2997
01:27:58,010 --> 01:28:00,710
a solar photo voltaic generator.

2998
01:28:00,740 --> 01:28:00,921
You know,

2999
01:28:00,921 --> 01:28:02,330
we're from sunlight to electricity,

3000
01:28:02,380 --> 01:28:03,213
photovoltaic,

3001
01:28:03,500 --> 01:28:03,920
um,

3002
01:28:03,920 --> 01:28:05,630
that was more than 20% efficient.

3003
01:28:05,631 --> 01:28:06,740
Now you can't even get that now.

3004
01:28:07,030 --> 01:28:07,680
Um,

3005
01:28:07,680 --> 01:28:09,440
but meaning there was probably like 40,

3006
01:28:09,441 --> 01:28:14,441
50% turning sunlight directly into
electricity and it had a national security

3007
01:28:14,721 --> 01:28:15,860
order slapped on it.

3008
01:28:16,100 --> 01:28:18,140
And this mainstream scientific groups,

3009
01:28:18,141 --> 01:28:18,261
it's,

3010
01:28:18,261 --> 01:28:20,210
how could that be a threat
to national security?

3011
01:28:20,211 --> 01:28:24,020
It would have been a threat to the
domination of oil and coal and the

3012
01:28:24,021 --> 01:28:24,950
petrodollar system.

3013
01:28:25,280 --> 01:28:25,820
So,

3014
01:28:25,820 --> 01:28:26,450
you know,

3015
01:28:26,450 --> 01:28:28,730
this is not a conspiracy theory.

3016
01:28:29,150 --> 01:28:32,330
There are entities that have conspired
and you look at the wealth and power

3017
01:28:32,331 --> 01:28:33,410
behind these entities.

3018
01:28:33,411 --> 01:28:33,561
I mean,

3019
01:28:33,561 --> 01:28:35,270
people have been killed
for a lot less than this.

3020
01:28:35,560 --> 01:28:36,181
It really is.

3021
01:28:36,181 --> 01:28:37,630
That is such a loaded word,

3022
01:28:37,631 --> 01:28:38,560
that conspiracy,

3023
01:28:38,561 --> 01:28:41,040
it's unfortunate that
it's necessary to use a,

3024
01:28:41,080 --> 01:28:42,730
because it's been so co-opted.

3025
01:28:43,480 --> 01:28:43,661
Well,

3026
01:28:43,661 --> 01:28:43,801
I,

3027
01:28:43,801 --> 01:28:48,801
I think it's really more about special
interests in cartels always acting in

3028
01:28:49,001 --> 01:28:49,451
their interests.

3029
01:28:49,451 --> 01:28:50,620
And if you've got the power,

3030
01:28:50,920 --> 01:28:52,320
you're going to use it and you know,

3031
01:28:52,650 --> 01:28:53,230
here and here,

3032
01:28:53,230 --> 01:28:56,530
and here's the problem if the
people allow it to happen.

3033
01:28:56,531 --> 01:28:58,050
And I was just reading an article in,

3034
01:28:58,070 --> 01:28:58,290
uh,

3035
01:28:58,290 --> 01:28:59,800
in the new republic about this,

3036
01:29:00,220 --> 01:29:00,760
um,

3037
01:29:00,760 --> 01:29:01,630
that you,

3038
01:29:02,140 --> 01:29:02,800
whether you're,

3039
01:29:02,800 --> 01:29:03,190
you know,

3040
01:29:03,190 --> 01:29:04,680
letting Saddam Hussein or,

3041
01:29:04,681 --> 01:29:07,600
or the Libyan dictator Muammar
Qaddafi or whatever it is,

3042
01:29:07,601 --> 01:29:11,200
or you have to give them that power.

3043
01:29:11,470 --> 01:29:15,250
We give the power to the government
ultimately by our pacivity.

3044
01:29:15,550 --> 01:29:16,690
And so ultimately,

3045
01:29:16,720 --> 01:29:16,901
I,

3046
01:29:16,901 --> 01:29:17,141
you know,

3047
01:29:17,141 --> 01:29:18,790
I'm not one of these people
who runs around saying,

3048
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:19,241
oh,

3049
01:29:19,241 --> 01:29:19,541
well,

3050
01:29:19,541 --> 01:29:19,751
you know,

3051
01:29:19,751 --> 01:29:22,600
there are these boogie men that are
doing everything and we're just hapless

3052
01:29:22,601 --> 01:29:23,410
creatures.

3053
01:29:23,410 --> 01:29:24,310
If we're allowing it,

3054
01:29:24,311 --> 01:29:26,590
if we're not part of the solution,

3055
01:29:26,591 --> 01:29:27,424
we're part of the problem.

3056
01:29:27,520 --> 01:29:28,001
If we're gonna,

3057
01:29:28,001 --> 01:29:31,990
if we're allowing it by our inaction and
pacivity cause we're one of the bread

3058
01:29:31,991 --> 01:29:33,670
and circus people sitting around eating,

3059
01:29:33,850 --> 01:29:34,420
you know,

3060
01:29:34,420 --> 01:29:35,770
Cheetos and watching Jay Leno,

3061
01:29:35,771 --> 01:29:36,604
which is fine,

3062
01:29:36,670 --> 01:29:39,610
but if that's all we're doing and
we're not trying to fix this problem,

3063
01:29:39,970 --> 01:29:40,631
then you know,

3064
01:29:40,631 --> 01:29:45,310
obviously the passivity of the public and
our politicians who don't want to risk

3065
01:29:45,311 --> 01:29:50,080
their career or danger
in that power vacuum,

3066
01:29:50,290 --> 01:29:52,360
you're going to have these
sorts of people step and,

3067
01:29:52,530 --> 01:29:52,801
and,

3068
01:29:52,801 --> 01:29:54,520
and I think there's a power vacuum,

3069
01:29:54,860 --> 01:29:55,240
uh,

3070
01:29:55,240 --> 01:29:57,700
that existed for a little
while after World War II.

3071
01:29:58,000 --> 01:29:59,590
They gave an entry to these folks.

3072
01:29:59,650 --> 01:30:00,710
And um,

3073
01:30:00,910 --> 01:30:04,210
I think that it will continue
for as long as we let them do it.

3074
01:30:04,620 --> 01:30:08,220
I think it's pretty obvious when you
look at the fact that this is the age of

3075
01:30:08,221 --> 01:30:12,030
information where information is being
distributed more freely and more easily

3076
01:30:12,031 --> 01:30:12,810
than ever before.

3077
01:30:12,810 --> 01:30:13,030
Right?

3078
01:30:13,030 --> 01:30:13,290
Yet,

3079
01:30:13,290 --> 01:30:17,580
this is also the age where the government
is continuing to attack the bill of

3080
01:30:17,581 --> 01:30:18,180
rights.

3081
01:30:18,180 --> 01:30:23,180
Continuing to slowly but surely restrict
our rights and civil liberties and make

3082
01:30:23,851 --> 01:30:27,540
it so that if they deem you a
threat to the nation in any way,

3083
01:30:27,541 --> 01:30:28,374
shape or form,

3084
01:30:28,410 --> 01:30:29,760
they can essentially detain you.

3085
01:30:29,790 --> 01:30:31,560
They don't have to do anything legal,

3086
01:30:31,561 --> 01:30:33,030
they don't have to contact your family.

3087
01:30:33,210 --> 01:30:35,610
This is all stuff that's being passed now.

3088
01:30:35,910 --> 01:30:40,910
And that seems to me to point to the
fact that they're looking at this w w w

3089
01:30:41,581 --> 01:30:42,181
what is the,

3090
01:30:42,181 --> 01:30:42,781
what's where,

3091
01:30:42,781 --> 01:30:43,441
where's it going?

3092
01:30:43,441 --> 01:30:43,711
What's,

3093
01:30:43,711 --> 01:30:45,030
if you look at it on a graph,

3094
01:30:45,180 --> 01:30:45,831
if you look at it,

3095
01:30:45,831 --> 01:30:47,490
if you project the future,

3096
01:30:47,670 --> 01:30:47,821
well,

3097
01:30:47,821 --> 01:30:51,660
it's going towards some
ultimate free information space.

3098
01:30:51,840 --> 01:30:53,190
And if it gets to that,

3099
01:30:53,191 --> 01:30:56,790
then it's going to be revealed exactly
how much fucker he's been going on for

3100
01:30:56,791 --> 01:31:00,840
all these decades and how much craziness
has been going on behind the scenes.

3101
01:31:00,841 --> 01:31:02,730
And it's going to come to a point in time,

3102
01:31:02,731 --> 01:31:05,490
or the government's gonna have to be
accountable for where all the money goes

3103
01:31:05,491 --> 01:31:06,840
every year in tax dollars.

3104
01:31:07,110 --> 01:31:08,040
And right now they're not.

3105
01:31:08,041 --> 01:31:09,390
You give them your tax dollars,

3106
01:31:09,391 --> 01:31:10,320
you don't get a receipt,

3107
01:31:10,470 --> 01:31:11,790
you don't know what the fuck happens.

3108
01:31:11,791 --> 01:31:14,420
There's a con congressional
budget meetings and they,

3109
01:31:14,440 --> 01:31:15,120
the Senate,

3110
01:31:15,120 --> 01:31:15,480
you know,

3111
01:31:15,480 --> 01:31:20,010
gets together and the president puts out
his plan and the financial people get

3112
01:31:20,011 --> 01:31:20,730
involved.

3113
01:31:20,730 --> 01:31:21,301
But what,

3114
01:31:21,301 --> 01:31:25,800
how much access do we actually
have as to where your doctor,

3115
01:31:25,801 --> 01:31:29,220
Steven Greer's financial
records are your tax dollars go?

3116
01:31:29,370 --> 01:31:30,090
Almost nothing.

3117
01:31:30,090 --> 01:31:30,241
Oh,

3118
01:31:30,241 --> 01:31:30,700
we don't know.

3119
01:31:30,700 --> 01:31:32,370
And even the folks who,

3120
01:31:32,371 --> 01:31:33,204
uh,

3121
01:31:33,210 --> 01:31:36,870
I know an auditor in it for the federal
government who audits Northrop Grumman,

3122
01:31:37,560 --> 01:31:38,311
and he said,

3123
01:31:38,311 --> 01:31:42,060
one of the problems is that once you get
to a compartment compartment it project

3124
01:31:42,210 --> 01:31:44,610
that's eyes only and it's unacknowledged,

3125
01:31:44,850 --> 01:31:45,960
they're not going to tell you anything.

3126
01:31:46,020 --> 01:31:47,550
They won't even acknowledge it exists.

3127
01:31:47,700 --> 01:31:48,181
So how,

3128
01:31:48,181 --> 01:31:49,590
is there any check and balance on that?

3129
01:31:49,710 --> 01:31:51,020
It's essentially a dictatorship.

3130
01:31:51,040 --> 01:31:51,230
Yeah.

3131
01:31:51,230 --> 01:31:51,951
When it gets to that,

3132
01:31:51,951 --> 01:31:52,161
really,

3133
01:31:52,161 --> 01:31:52,341
you're,

3134
01:31:52,341 --> 01:31:52,551
you're,

3135
01:31:52,551 --> 01:31:54,230
you're essentially dealing
with a dictatorship.

3136
01:31:54,380 --> 01:31:56,060
It's just dressed up as a democracy.

3137
01:31:56,061 --> 01:31:58,100
But their ability to act as complete.

3138
01:31:58,101 --> 01:31:58,910
We there,

3139
01:31:58,910 --> 01:32:00,340
there they have total impunity.

3140
01:32:00,340 --> 01:32:01,360
They can do whatever the fuck they want.

3141
01:32:01,361 --> 01:32:01,661
They don't,

3142
01:32:01,661 --> 01:32:01,990
they don't,

3143
01:32:01,990 --> 01:32:03,790
they don't have to listen
to me if we let them.

3144
01:32:04,420 --> 01:32:05,780
Here's the other problem with that,

3145
01:32:05,800 --> 01:32:06,220
you know,

3146
01:32:06,220 --> 01:32:06,811
is that the,

3147
01:32:06,811 --> 01:32:08,170
the macro economic system,

3148
01:32:08,171 --> 01:32:08,351
you know,

3149
01:32:08,351 --> 01:32:10,360
we're supposed to be
a free market economy.

3150
01:32:10,600 --> 01:32:10,751
Well,

3151
01:32:10,751 --> 01:32:15,340
how free can the market be if there've
been decades of confiscation and

3152
01:32:15,341 --> 01:32:17,440
suppression of these advanced,

3153
01:32:17,500 --> 01:32:18,280
uh,

3154
01:32:18,280 --> 01:32:22,150
trans dimensional energy devices in
the so called over unity free energy

3155
01:32:22,151 --> 01:32:22,984
devices.

3156
01:32:23,080 --> 01:32:24,160
And if the,

3157
01:32:24,161 --> 01:32:25,540
if that's going on,

3158
01:32:25,870 --> 01:32:30,190
a can completely lays to waste the
whole concept of a free market.

3159
01:32:30,340 --> 01:32:30,701
So yeah,

3160
01:32:30,701 --> 01:32:34,000
it's a free market if you want to tinker
around the edges and come out with an

3161
01:32:34,001 --> 01:32:37,000
iPhone and five instead of
an iPhone four or you know,

3162
01:32:37,001 --> 01:32:38,410
whatever version of this and that.

3163
01:32:38,680 --> 01:32:42,160
But let's not forget that your
computer that you think is so cool,

3164
01:32:42,370 --> 01:32:46,390
you're charging it off a grid that's a
18 hundreds coal fired power grid for the

3165
01:32:46,391 --> 01:32:47,224
most part.

3166
01:32:47,260 --> 01:32:47,860
And so,

3167
01:32:47,860 --> 01:32:48,260
you know,

3168
01:32:48,260 --> 01:32:53,260
we really have to wake up to the fact
that our society has been held back

3169
01:32:53,771 --> 01:32:54,604
retarded.

3170
01:32:54,850 --> 01:32:59,350
I'm really seriously by
this kind of secrecy.

3171
01:32:59,590 --> 01:33:03,190
And so the secrecy is actually
becoming a threat to our continued,

3172
01:33:03,191 --> 01:33:04,210
not just our liberty,

3173
01:33:04,420 --> 01:33:06,550
but it's an existential
threat to the planet.

3174
01:33:06,850 --> 01:33:07,930
And Moreover,

3175
01:33:07,931 --> 01:33:11,380
it keeps forcing all these unintended
consequences where we stay,

3176
01:33:11,680 --> 01:33:12,350
uh,

3177
01:33:12,350 --> 01:33:13,840
encamped in the Middle East.

3178
01:33:13,990 --> 01:33:14,321
And you know,

3179
01:33:14,321 --> 01:33:18,340
the buzzword in Washington because of
our vital national security interests.

3180
01:33:18,550 --> 01:33:18,761
Well,

3181
01:33:18,761 --> 01:33:19,960
that's code for oil.

3182
01:33:19,990 --> 01:33:21,460
Just forget the BS.

3183
01:33:21,640 --> 01:33:23,020
That means oil because you say,

3184
01:33:23,021 --> 01:33:23,291
well,

3185
01:33:23,291 --> 01:33:24,130
what about Israel?

3186
01:33:24,131 --> 01:33:26,980
Israel has two or 300 nuclear
weapons and they might,

3187
01:33:26,981 --> 01:33:28,060
I live there for three years.

3188
01:33:28,510 --> 01:33:28,901
Believe me,

3189
01:33:28,901 --> 01:33:30,470
when I tell you the thing,

3190
01:33:30,490 --> 01:33:31,323
they care of this.

3191
01:33:31,330 --> 01:33:31,631
I mean,

3192
01:33:31,631 --> 01:33:31,811
you know,

3193
01:33:31,811 --> 01:33:31,961
if,

3194
01:33:31,961 --> 01:33:32,271
if they,

3195
01:33:32,271 --> 01:33:34,330
if there's an existential
threat to Israel,

3196
01:33:35,070 --> 01:33:35,410
you know,

3197
01:33:35,410 --> 01:33:36,130
they can handle it.

3198
01:33:36,130 --> 01:33:37,960
They don't need big brother America there,

3199
01:33:38,230 --> 01:33:39,070
but don't they mean,

3200
01:33:39,071 --> 01:33:39,490
isn't it,

3201
01:33:39,490 --> 01:33:42,280
don't they get a tremendous amount of
funding from us and weapon and they get

3202
01:33:42,281 --> 01:33:42,611
funding.

3203
01:33:42,611 --> 01:33:43,600
But I'm just saying we don't,

3204
01:33:43,601 --> 01:33:46,780
that's not the reason we were an all
those vast areas of the Middle East.

3205
01:33:46,781 --> 01:33:48,640
It's because of the oil intercourse.

3206
01:33:48,790 --> 01:33:49,070
And,

3207
01:33:49,070 --> 01:33:49,901
and you know,

3208
01:33:49,901 --> 01:33:51,910
and this becomes a question of,

3209
01:33:52,300 --> 01:33:53,133
uh,

3210
01:33:53,260 --> 01:33:54,093
why?

3211
01:33:54,130 --> 01:33:54,610
Well,

3212
01:33:54,610 --> 01:33:57,790
because if you have a device
that would fit on the table here,

3213
01:33:58,750 --> 01:34:01,620
that run your house when you don't
have to be on the grid or your car,

3214
01:34:01,621 --> 01:34:04,540
put it in the boot of your car and
you have enormous amount of power,

3215
01:34:04,660 --> 01:34:05,110
electric,

3216
01:34:05,110 --> 01:34:05,943
how would that work?

3217
01:34:06,820 --> 01:34:07,600
Um,

3218
01:34:07,600 --> 01:34:08,590
those are called,

3219
01:34:08,630 --> 01:34:09,010
uh,

3220
01:34:09,010 --> 01:34:10,780
zero point or quantum vacuum,

3221
01:34:11,050 --> 01:34:11,883
uh,

3222
01:34:11,980 --> 01:34:13,330
electromagnetic generators.

3223
01:34:13,331 --> 01:34:16,180
And basically through
very high voltage systems,

3224
01:34:16,510 --> 01:34:21,510
you create a vector into this baseline
energy field that it really holds the

3225
01:34:22,421 --> 01:34:23,254
universe together.

3226
01:34:23,620 --> 01:34:23,891
And you know,

3227
01:34:23,891 --> 01:34:27,490
they start talking about the Higgs field
and the negative energy that matter of

3228
01:34:27,491 --> 01:34:28,031
the universe.

3229
01:34:28,031 --> 01:34:32,650
But for years it's been proven that the
zero point energy field exists through

3230
01:34:32,651 --> 01:34:32,830
the,

3231
01:34:32,830 --> 01:34:34,210
what's called the castle mirror effect.

3232
01:34:34,270 --> 01:34:36,460
And don't get into the
Arcana of the physics of it.

3233
01:34:36,660 --> 01:34:38,290
But this was published
in mainstream journals.

3234
01:34:38,410 --> 01:34:39,280
The question is,

3235
01:34:39,520 --> 01:34:41,500
how do you tap it and can you,

3236
01:34:41,501 --> 01:34:42,251
and the answer is yes,

3237
01:34:42,251 --> 01:34:43,084
and it happened,

3238
01:34:43,150 --> 01:34:46,420
but they keep suppressing scientists
and inventors who come up with it.

3239
01:34:46,600 --> 01:34:49,840
There was a man that I know who worked
at Lawrence Berkeley labs and he was

3240
01:34:49,841 --> 01:34:54,841
using a coil to ray around a Barium
titanate crystal and using very high

3241
01:34:55,991 --> 01:34:56,824
voltages,

3242
01:34:56,870 --> 01:34:57,380
um,

3243
01:34:57,380 --> 01:34:58,130
with a

3244
01:34:58,130 --> 01:34:59,630
certain hertz,

3245
01:34:59,631 --> 01:35:00,470
certain pulses.

3246
01:35:00,770 --> 01:35:05,060
He was able to get 10 times more energy
out than was going in because the

3247
01:35:05,061 --> 01:35:08,900
Chrysalis structure was tapping into this
zero point energy field that is in the

3248
01:35:08,901 --> 01:35:10,340
fabric of space and time.

3249
01:35:10,610 --> 01:35:12,350
So there's an enormous amount of power.

3250
01:35:12,351 --> 01:35:14,930
It's been estimated that every
cubic centimeter of space,

3251
01:35:15,120 --> 01:35:18,500
not outer space of space in this room
has enough energy to run the earth for a

3252
01:35:18,501 --> 01:35:19,430
day if you could tap it.

3253
01:35:19,760 --> 01:35:20,810
So the question becomes,

3254
01:35:20,811 --> 01:35:21,890
if you can do that,

3255
01:35:22,640 --> 01:35:26,660
you're not going to need to have your
car filled up at a gas station or utility

3256
01:35:26,661 --> 01:35:28,130
to con ed or whoever it is.

3257
01:35:28,550 --> 01:35:29,450
And uh,

3258
01:35:29,480 --> 01:35:30,950
those sort of interests at Trump,

3259
01:35:30,951 --> 01:35:33,470
the technical ones to
technological issues.

3260
01:35:33,920 --> 01:35:34,753
Um,

3261
01:35:34,880 --> 01:35:36,710
I believe it can be fixed.

3262
01:35:36,980 --> 01:35:38,720
It's the strategic issue.

3263
01:35:38,721 --> 01:35:39,400
That's the problem.

3264
01:35:39,400 --> 01:35:41,830
I'm going to stop you because I
need to know about this experiment.

3265
01:35:42,160 --> 01:35:43,930
Where was this taking place?

3266
01:35:43,931 --> 01:35:45,610
This is this pure reviewed?

3267
01:35:45,611 --> 01:35:47,170
Is this something that has been,

3268
01:35:47,400 --> 01:35:48,640
it was confiscated a,

3269
01:35:48,641 --> 01:35:51,030
the man that had this happen,

3270
01:35:51,120 --> 01:35:51,750
um,

3271
01:35:51,750 --> 01:35:53,730
it's a physicist and a,

3272
01:35:54,480 --> 01:35:56,190
some goons broke into his lab,

3273
01:35:56,400 --> 01:36:00,960
broke it up at the experiment and then
basically took him and put him in a

3274
01:36:00,961 --> 01:36:03,240
mental hospital in the hospital
for awhile where this happened.

3275
01:36:03,510 --> 01:36:05,970
Lawrence Berkeley labs
in the eighties okay.

3276
01:36:06,030 --> 01:36:07,190
So seventies or eighties.

3277
01:36:07,210 --> 01:36:09,030
I don't know exactly what he did.

3278
01:36:09,060 --> 01:36:10,350
And is it reproducible?

3279
01:36:10,480 --> 01:36:10,840
Yeah.

3280
01:36:10,840 --> 01:36:13,350
I I think why has no
one ever reproduce this?

3281
01:36:13,410 --> 01:36:16,830
It doesn't make any sense because you
have to have a whole lot of specialized

3282
01:36:16,831 --> 01:36:17,790
equipment to do it right.

3283
01:36:17,791 --> 01:36:21,920
And people have tried what the hero
now here to here is getting to the,

3284
01:36:21,950 --> 01:36:22,261
really,

3285
01:36:22,261 --> 01:36:27,261
the reason I'm doing this film is that
100% of the proceeds from it are going to

3286
01:36:27,331 --> 01:36:28,800
go into build a new energy lab.

3287
01:36:28,920 --> 01:36:31,230
So all this stuff that
we've collected can be done.

3288
01:36:31,500 --> 01:36:34,980
I think with the intelligence we've
gathered in between one and two years,

3289
01:36:35,160 --> 01:36:39,870
we will come out with at
least a generation 1.0 of
these energy systems because

3290
01:36:39,871 --> 01:36:43,530
I have thousands of pages of
documents on this and many,

3291
01:36:43,531 --> 01:36:45,450
many physicists who
worked in these programs,

3292
01:36:45,570 --> 01:36:47,760
but you've got to have
a properly equip lab.

3293
01:36:47,820 --> 01:36:48,960
You've got to have security,

3294
01:36:49,170 --> 01:36:51,060
you've got to have the
whole world watching,

3295
01:36:51,061 --> 01:36:53,910
and this would not be a secret project
like the skunk works at Lockheed.

3296
01:36:54,150 --> 01:36:54,983
This would be,

3297
01:36:54,990 --> 01:36:56,010
I would in my,

3298
01:36:56,100 --> 01:36:56,791
it'd be like this,

3299
01:36:56,791 --> 01:36:57,624
it'd be streamed.

3300
01:36:57,750 --> 01:36:59,340
So all the work going on in that lab,

3301
01:36:59,341 --> 01:37:00,420
the whole world's watching.

3302
01:37:00,570 --> 01:37:00,811
Okay.

3303
01:37:00,811 --> 01:37:01,260
Sorry,

3304
01:37:01,260 --> 01:37:02,970
because I don't think
you can do this secretly.

3305
01:37:03,480 --> 01:37:04,780
You know about this story.

3306
01:37:04,781 --> 01:37:09,190
How come you knew about this experiment
tapping into zero point energy,

3307
01:37:09,400 --> 01:37:12,130
but this is not common knowledge
amongst nuclear physicists.

3308
01:37:12,131 --> 01:37:14,560
This is not something that's
discussed in the mainstream news.

3309
01:37:14,710 --> 01:37:17,950
This is not something that you can find
information online and any credible

3310
01:37:17,951 --> 01:37:18,580
source.

3311
01:37:18,580 --> 01:37:19,390
No one has [inaudible].

3312
01:37:19,390 --> 01:37:22,960
It seems to me that if there was an
experiment that tapped into such an

3313
01:37:22,961 --> 01:37:25,360
unbelievably unlimited
supply of energy like that,

3314
01:37:25,600 --> 01:37:28,630
it would be impossible
to keep this under wraps,

3315
01:37:28,660 --> 01:37:29,780
that you would keep the beak,

3316
01:37:29,840 --> 01:37:32,080
be able to keep the
conversation under wraps.

3317
01:37:32,370 --> 01:37:32,790
No,

3318
01:37:32,790 --> 01:37:33,511
that's not true.

3319
01:37:33,511 --> 01:37:34,081
And in fact,

3320
01:37:34,081 --> 01:37:35,880
if you go to the website,

3321
01:37:35,881 --> 01:37:37,170
serious disclosure.com,

3322
01:37:37,171 --> 01:37:40,260
there's a portal there to the energy
research and there are thousands of

3323
01:37:40,261 --> 01:37:42,030
documents and pages of stuff,

3324
01:37:42,270 --> 01:37:44,880
things that were reported in the
media and then they got confiscated in

3325
01:37:44,881 --> 01:37:45,714
shutdown.

3326
01:37:45,750 --> 01:37:46,320
But you're,

3327
01:37:46,320 --> 01:37:50,610
you're asking this question as if academia
and the media are operating freely,

3328
01:37:50,760 --> 01:37:52,140
none under the suppressive,

3329
01:37:52,470 --> 01:37:52,860
uh,

3330
01:37:52,860 --> 01:37:53,521
behaviors.

3331
01:37:53,521 --> 01:37:53,721
And,

3332
01:37:53,721 --> 01:37:54,160
and I thought,

3333
01:37:54,160 --> 01:37:54,330
man,

3334
01:37:54,330 --> 01:37:55,980
I'm asking the actually because

3335
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:59,550
it just the nature of human curiosity
and an incredibly brilliant,

3336
01:37:59,650 --> 01:38:00,061
brilliant,

3337
01:38:00,061 --> 01:38:02,700
intelligent men that are
out there that study energy.

3338
01:38:02,940 --> 01:38:05,340
I would think that someone would
look into this and he examined it.

3339
01:38:05,400 --> 01:38:05,681
Okay.

3340
01:38:05,681 --> 01:38:05,771
You're,

3341
01:38:05,771 --> 01:38:05,921
well,

3342
01:38:05,921 --> 01:38:06,271
there is,

3343
01:38:06,271 --> 01:38:06,750
and in fact,

3344
01:38:06,750 --> 01:38:08,870
one of the people that we
had were funding for awhile,

3345
01:38:08,890 --> 01:38:09,570
um,

3346
01:38:09,570 --> 01:38:13,350
before he got threatened by a former
CIA director who went down to his skiff.

3347
01:38:13,400 --> 01:38:15,660
It's secure communication
intelligence facility.

3348
01:38:16,320 --> 01:38:16,950
Um,

3349
01:38:16,950 --> 01:38:17,460
was,

3350
01:38:17,460 --> 01:38:17,790
uh,

3351
01:38:17,790 --> 01:38:20,670
an understudy of William Bender
at the University of Washington.

3352
01:38:20,671 --> 01:38:23,880
He got threatened and
what they say in 1974,

3353
01:38:23,881 --> 01:38:24,930
I think it was 74,

3354
01:38:24,931 --> 01:38:26,250
he formed a company,

3355
01:38:26,370 --> 01:38:26,790
uh,

3356
01:38:26,790 --> 01:38:29,640
and he's a brilliant to one of the
most brilliant people I've ever met.

3357
01:38:30,180 --> 01:38:30,750
Um,

3358
01:38:30,750 --> 01:38:31,201
who,

3359
01:38:31,201 --> 01:38:32,340
and he had developed a,

3360
01:38:32,350 --> 01:38:37,110
these trans dimensional systems
using electromagnetic energy.

3361
01:38:37,560 --> 01:38:38,220
And,

3362
01:38:38,220 --> 01:38:38,580
uh,

3363
01:38:38,580 --> 01:38:41,190
some guys came in with a
national security order,

3364
01:38:41,760 --> 01:38:42,150
uh,

3365
01:38:42,150 --> 01:38:44,880
told him that they were
confiscating his equipment,

3366
01:38:44,881 --> 01:38:45,714
his device,

3367
01:38:45,780 --> 01:38:46,411
his notes,

3368
01:38:46,411 --> 01:38:48,210
and they were all going into the vault.

3369
01:38:48,660 --> 01:38:50,070
And this man's,

3370
01:38:50,180 --> 01:38:50,700
uh,

3371
01:38:50,700 --> 01:38:51,600
who I knew very well,

3372
01:38:51,660 --> 01:38:56,550
who stayed at my home and it still works
for 'em under contract with the CIA and

3373
01:38:56,551 --> 01:38:57,480
various groups.

3374
01:38:57,960 --> 01:38:58,440
Um,

3375
01:38:58,440 --> 01:38:59,610
he said that basically,

3376
01:38:59,630 --> 01:38:59,940
uh,

3377
01:38:59,940 --> 01:39:04,940
the intelligence community owns his soul
and that he can only do only so much it

3378
01:39:06,140 --> 01:39:08,520
take it take to provide
information and bring this out.

3379
01:39:08,910 --> 01:39:09,780
And uh,

3380
01:39:09,781 --> 01:39:09,991
you know,

3381
01:39:09,991 --> 01:39:12,810
people who think that doesn't happen
or living in very naive world.

3382
01:39:12,811 --> 01:39:13,980
This is 40 years ago though,

3383
01:39:13,981 --> 01:39:14,730
you're talking about.

3384
01:39:14,730 --> 01:39:15,070
Um,

3385
01:39:15,070 --> 01:39:15,903
and it would happen.

3386
01:39:16,800 --> 01:39:19,320
That was 40 years ago when
hit when the thing he started.

3387
01:39:19,321 --> 01:39:20,190
Then when he,

3388
01:39:20,250 --> 01:39:22,260
after I developed a relationship with him,

3389
01:39:22,470 --> 01:39:24,930
he checked with his intelligence
and what they called the shepherds,

3390
01:39:24,931 --> 01:39:27,120
his in his handlers in the
intelligence community.

3391
01:39:27,330 --> 01:39:27,661
They said,

3392
01:39:27,661 --> 01:39:27,841
yes,

3393
01:39:27,841 --> 01:39:28,910
you can work with Dr. Greer,

3394
01:39:28,950 --> 01:39:32,220
not on the propulsion stuff
that flies around like a Ufo,

3395
01:39:32,400 --> 01:39:34,380
but just when the energy
generation part of this.

3396
01:39:34,830 --> 01:39:37,980
And so we provided a grant
to him through my project,

3397
01:39:37,981 --> 01:39:38,940
the Orion project,

3398
01:39:39,590 --> 01:39:39,840
uh,

3399
01:39:39,840 --> 01:39:41,040
which is government limits,

3400
01:39:41,041 --> 01:39:43,920
his ability to do research
on specific topics.

3401
01:39:44,670 --> 01:39:45,060
Uh,

3402
01:39:45,060 --> 01:39:48,420
well he actually is on the payroll to
government now cause he was basically told

3403
01:39:48,421 --> 01:39:48,781
us this,

3404
01:39:48,781 --> 01:39:50,100
so you have no career at all.

3405
01:39:50,640 --> 01:39:55,640
And if he had disclosed what he had
been invented in 1974 under the national

3406
01:39:56,041 --> 01:39:57,810
security or he was hit with,

3407
01:39:58,080 --> 01:39:59,220
he would have been imprisoned.

3408
01:39:59,580 --> 01:40:00,210
So,

3409
01:40:00,210 --> 01:40:00,780
um,

3410
01:40:00,780 --> 01:40:02,010
and these exists,

3411
01:40:02,011 --> 01:40:02,611
you can look it up.

3412
01:40:02,611 --> 01:40:05,850
It's section one 81 81 of the patent
law and the National Security Act.

3413
01:40:06,180 --> 01:40:09,270
These national security
orders happen all the time.

3414
01:40:09,480 --> 01:40:09,930
So,

3415
01:40:09,930 --> 01:40:10,810
but who's authorized?

3416
01:40:10,840 --> 01:40:11,161
You think?

3417
01:40:11,161 --> 01:40:11,251
Oh,

3418
01:40:11,251 --> 01:40:14,520
President Obama or the or the Senate
Intelligence Committee knows that these

3419
01:40:14,521 --> 01:40:16,950
goons are out there doing this stuff.

3420
01:40:16,951 --> 01:40:17,520
No.

3421
01:40:17,520 --> 01:40:19,230
And so here's this brilliant guy,

3422
01:40:19,560 --> 01:40:20,041
but I mean,

3423
01:40:20,041 --> 01:40:21,390
he's not like he's Rambo.

3424
01:40:21,780 --> 01:40:22,091
I mean he,

3425
01:40:22,091 --> 01:40:23,790
he's an engineer and a physicist.

3426
01:40:23,910 --> 01:40:25,380
So he develops this stuff.

3427
01:40:25,381 --> 01:40:28,380
A bunch of guys come in
who are bad ass folks.

3428
01:40:28,381 --> 01:40:29,214
Okay.

3429
01:40:29,250 --> 01:40:30,840
And he's terrified.

3430
01:40:31,530 --> 01:40:34,800
And so then all these years
later it circles back around,

3431
01:40:34,830 --> 01:40:37,860
we get hold of him and what we say,

3432
01:40:37,861 --> 01:40:38,100
look,

3433
01:40:38,100 --> 01:40:38,341
okay,

3434
01:40:38,341 --> 01:40:39,120
here's,

3435
01:40:39,120 --> 01:40:39,511
you know,

3436
01:40:39,511 --> 01:40:41,370
some funds do this,

3437
01:40:41,390 --> 01:40:41,610
uh,

3438
01:40:41,610 --> 01:40:43,410
for us own a generation,

3439
01:40:43,411 --> 01:40:44,970
1.0 version of this something.

3440
01:40:45,360 --> 01:40:45,631
Uh,

3441
01:40:45,631 --> 01:40:47,130
and check with your intelligence folks.

3442
01:40:47,131 --> 01:40:51,390
And they cleared him about the time he
was beginning to put this thing together.

3443
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:52,980
A former CIA director,

3444
01:40:53,080 --> 01:40:55,180
a bunch of goons came down in 2010,

3445
01:40:55,240 --> 01:40:55,841
this is two years,

3446
01:40:55,841 --> 01:40:56,674
three years ago,

3447
01:40:56,890 --> 01:40:57,723
threatened him,

3448
01:40:57,730 --> 01:40:58,690
threatened his family.

3449
01:40:59,500 --> 01:41:00,810
And so like,

3450
01:41:00,811 --> 01:41:01,644
how do I say,

3451
01:41:01,720 --> 01:41:04,870
you are not going to do this any
further and made it very clear.

3452
01:41:05,020 --> 01:41:05,680
Um,

3453
01:41:05,680 --> 01:41:09,100
one of the guides at the naval research
labs I've worked with for years who has

3454
01:41:09,101 --> 01:41:09,940
some of this information,

3455
01:41:09,941 --> 01:41:11,770
he was till we will kill you,

3456
01:41:11,950 --> 01:41:12,783
your wife,

3457
01:41:12,850 --> 01:41:13,630
your children,

3458
01:41:13,630 --> 01:41:16,060
and your grandchildren if
you step out of line on this.

3459
01:41:16,480 --> 01:41:17,710
So I don't think that,

3460
01:41:17,711 --> 01:41:17,861
you know,

3461
01:41:17,861 --> 01:41:21,580
in terms of dealing with this that you're
going to be able to do it under any

3462
01:41:21,581 --> 01:41:24,070
kind of where someone's
trying to do it quietly,

3463
01:41:24,071 --> 01:41:24,910
secretively,

3464
01:41:24,940 --> 01:41:26,980
it's going to have to be in plain sight.

3465
01:41:27,010 --> 01:41:30,810
So what you're saying is that several
people have tried to do this in the past

3466
01:41:30,820 --> 01:41:34,120
hundred every time and every time they
do it they're threatened and stopped from

3467
01:41:34,121 --> 01:41:34,481
doing it.

3468
01:41:34,481 --> 01:41:34,990
Right.

3469
01:41:34,990 --> 01:41:39,990
What specialized pieces of equipment
would be necessary to produce this zero

3470
01:41:40,001 --> 01:41:42,310
point energy field thing?

3471
01:41:42,670 --> 01:41:42,911
Well,

3472
01:41:42,911 --> 01:41:43,720
first of all,

3473
01:41:43,720 --> 01:41:44,290
um,

3474
01:41:44,290 --> 01:41:44,831
you know your,

3475
01:41:44,831 --> 01:41:48,100
your computer in lights who
are running on one 10 or 2020,

3476
01:41:48,400 --> 01:41:48,731
all right,

3477
01:41:48,731 --> 01:41:49,564
voltage,

3478
01:41:49,960 --> 01:41:53,830
the voltage is involved in these trans
dimensional physics is in the thousands

3479
01:41:53,830 --> 01:41:54,490
to millions of volts,

3480
01:41:54,490 --> 01:41:55,690
but it very low current.

3481
01:41:56,290 --> 01:41:59,980
And so you have to have special
analyzers and generators for that.

3482
01:42:00,340 --> 01:42:00,760
So,

3483
01:42:00,760 --> 01:42:00,941
I mean,

3484
01:42:00,941 --> 01:42:03,280
there is a science to this
and we understand it very,

3485
01:42:03,281 --> 01:42:04,210
very well actually.

3486
01:42:04,630 --> 01:42:05,110
Um,

3487
01:42:05,110 --> 01:42:06,730
but building up that lab,

3488
01:42:06,740 --> 01:42:06,881
I mean,

3489
01:42:06,881 --> 01:42:08,230
we looked into the equipment just,

3490
01:42:08,231 --> 01:42:10,210
is it like half $1
million just to do that?

3491
01:42:10,630 --> 01:42:11,290
Um,

3492
01:42:11,290 --> 01:42:14,110
and so what you have to do
is it seems like nothing,

3493
01:42:14,140 --> 01:42:15,580
if you're talking about half $1 billion,

3494
01:42:15,760 --> 01:42:16,460
they can bring newness.

3495
01:42:16,460 --> 01:42:17,440
That's just the equipment.

3496
01:42:17,470 --> 01:42:17,581
No,

3497
01:42:17,581 --> 01:42:17,680
no,

3498
01:42:17,680 --> 01:42:17,801
no.

3499
01:42:17,801 --> 01:42:18,340
This no,

3500
01:42:18,340 --> 01:42:18,971
no building,

3501
01:42:18,971 --> 01:42:19,721
no personnel,

3502
01:42:19,721 --> 01:42:20,291
no staff,

3503
01:42:20,291 --> 01:42:20,801
no nothing.

3504
01:42:20,801 --> 01:42:21,321
Just you know,

3505
01:42:21,321 --> 01:42:22,090
and the machine.

3506
01:42:22,090 --> 01:42:22,780
So,

3507
01:42:22,780 --> 01:42:23,630
but so I,

3508
01:42:23,740 --> 01:42:24,700
we estimate,

3509
01:42:24,980 --> 01:42:25,160
uh,

3510
01:42:25,160 --> 01:42:25,541
we have,

3511
01:42:25,541 --> 01:42:26,150
uh,

3512
01:42:26,150 --> 01:42:28,510
a budget for about a two year program,

3513
01:42:28,600 --> 01:42:31,420
around $6 million to put a lab together,

3514
01:42:31,421 --> 01:42:33,160
put these really brilliant people in it,

3515
01:42:33,370 --> 01:42:37,420
get the right equipment and built up
these experiments and do real science.

3516
01:42:37,780 --> 01:42:40,720
But the problem is you have people
off on their own doing this,

3517
01:42:40,721 --> 01:42:45,460
that stumble across this phenomenon
and they get shut down or threatened or

3518
01:42:45,461 --> 01:42:46,294
bought out.

3519
01:42:46,540 --> 01:42:47,230
Um,

3520
01:42:47,230 --> 01:42:47,741
then,

3521
01:42:47,741 --> 01:42:48,131
you know,

3522
01:42:48,131 --> 01:42:49,300
you had the folks who,

3523
01:42:49,690 --> 01:42:50,523
um,

3524
01:42:50,680 --> 01:42:51,513
will be,

3525
01:42:51,580 --> 01:42:52,540
instead of threatened,

3526
01:42:52,541 --> 01:42:53,920
they'll just be offered money.

3527
01:42:54,250 --> 01:42:54,491
You know,

3528
01:42:54,491 --> 01:42:55,420
so a lot of people,

3529
01:42:55,570 --> 01:42:55,860
uh,

3530
01:42:55,860 --> 01:42:56,101
uh,

3531
01:42:56,101 --> 01:42:59,070
Dr. Beard and tells this story of a man
that had one of these generators and,

3532
01:42:59,071 --> 01:43:02,410
and he was testing it and it was
a legitimate over unity system.

3533
01:43:02,950 --> 01:43:03,341
And the,

3534
01:43:03,341 --> 01:43:04,300
then the guy disappeared.

3535
01:43:04,301 --> 01:43:07,930
And the next time you saw the guy who
had a Ferrari in an Armani suit and the

3536
01:43:07,931 --> 01:43:10,210
guy never had a pot to pee in as it were.

3537
01:43:10,510 --> 01:43:10,841
And,

3538
01:43:10,841 --> 01:43:11,230
and,

3539
01:43:11,230 --> 01:43:12,520
and you know,

3540
01:43:12,610 --> 01:43:15,970
what we found with this is that a
lot of times folks will just say,

3541
01:43:15,971 --> 01:43:16,600
look,

3542
01:43:16,600 --> 01:43:16,871
you know,

3543
01:43:16,871 --> 01:43:17,770
we're going to buy this.

3544
01:43:17,860 --> 01:43:18,220
Uh,

3545
01:43:18,220 --> 01:43:19,053
and,

3546
01:43:19,140 --> 01:43:19,440
uh,

3547
01:43:19,440 --> 01:43:22,720
a lot of people don't believe that
happens and they think that's a conspiracy

3548
01:43:22,721 --> 01:43:23,170
theory.

3549
01:43:23,170 --> 01:43:24,400
It isn't a conspiracy theory.

3550
01:43:24,640 --> 01:43:26,770
And this is why the Federation
of American scientists,

3551
01:43:26,771 --> 01:43:27,191
when they said,

3552
01:43:27,191 --> 01:43:27,371
look,

3553
01:43:27,371 --> 01:43:28,181
there are 5,000,

3554
01:43:28,181 --> 01:43:29,830
135 or something like that,

3555
01:43:29,831 --> 01:43:31,660
patents that had been seized.

3556
01:43:31,780 --> 01:43:35,680
Most people don't know that those national
security orders can happen outside of

3557
01:43:35,681 --> 01:43:36,700
the patent process.

3558
01:43:36,910 --> 01:43:38,650
So even if you're not
going the patent route,

3559
01:43:38,800 --> 01:43:40,720
they can go in there and
just sees the damn thing.

3560
01:43:41,290 --> 01:43:41,621
Uh,

3561
01:43:41,621 --> 01:43:42,550
and what are you going to do?

3562
01:43:42,970 --> 01:43:46,330
They just seize it based on the idea
that it somehow or another threat,

3563
01:43:46,600 --> 01:43:47,380
well there you,

3564
01:43:47,380 --> 01:43:47,701
I mean it's,

3565
01:43:47,701 --> 01:43:50,920
it's Kinda like the flag in the Bible
and that you'd be wrap yourself in these

3566
01:43:50,930 --> 01:43:51,381
things.

3567
01:43:51,381 --> 01:43:52,310
It to do all kinds

3568
01:43:52,310 --> 01:43:53,630
of outrageous uh,

3569
01:43:54,020 --> 01:43:54,591
behaviors.

3570
01:43:54,591 --> 01:43:54,980
Yes.

3571
01:43:54,980 --> 01:43:57,410
But I mean you can say
it's national security,

3572
01:43:57,740 --> 01:44:01,190
but as this one document from
the Federation of American
scientists is how could

3573
01:44:01,191 --> 01:44:04,130
a solar voltaic system be a
threat to the national security?

3574
01:44:04,460 --> 01:44:07,820
It would be a threat to the special
interests that are calling the shots.

3575
01:44:07,940 --> 01:44:11,150
So the question becomes who's really
calling the shots on these sorts of

3576
01:44:11,151 --> 01:44:11,984
decisions?

3577
01:44:12,020 --> 01:44:13,910
Is it in the interest of we the people?

3578
01:44:14,180 --> 01:44:14,660
No,

3579
01:44:14,660 --> 01:44:17,140
it's in the interest of folks who,

3580
01:44:17,190 --> 01:44:18,830
who want to protect their cartels.

3581
01:44:19,690 --> 01:44:21,370
What is your take on,

3582
01:44:21,430 --> 01:44:21,850
um,

3583
01:44:21,850 --> 01:44:24,340
guys who have come clean before?

3584
01:44:24,630 --> 01:44:27,910
Guys like Dr Robert Lasar
cause that guy full of shit.

3585
01:44:28,240 --> 01:44:32,800
He's the guy from area 51 that came
back and said that he was a bright back

3586
01:44:32,801 --> 01:44:33,640
engineering,

3587
01:44:33,641 --> 01:44:38,020
some alien craft and very
compelling to listen to.

3588
01:44:38,021 --> 01:44:39,130
Very interesting guy.

3589
01:44:39,131 --> 01:44:40,270
Before I understand,

3590
01:44:40,300 --> 01:44:41,133
um,

3591
01:44:41,380 --> 01:44:46,150
Dr. Stanton Freedman questioned him and
in fact called him a fraud and said that

3592
01:44:46,151 --> 01:44:48,800
some of his educational
background was kind of made up.

3593
01:44:49,170 --> 01:44:49,530
Right.

3594
01:44:49,530 --> 01:44:53,220
But here's the problem with any case
where you hang it on one person like that,

3595
01:44:53,710 --> 01:44:54,330
um,

3596
01:44:54,330 --> 01:44:55,320
is very risky.

3597
01:44:55,470 --> 01:44:57,240
And that's why I've tried to resist that.

3598
01:44:57,270 --> 01:44:57,830
And then when we,

3599
01:44:57,830 --> 01:44:58,090
we,

3600
01:44:58,090 --> 01:44:59,400
when we started putting together,

3601
01:44:59,670 --> 01:44:59,911
uh,

3602
01:44:59,911 --> 01:45:01,100
the people who knew about the,

3603
01:45:01,101 --> 01:45:04,350
the nuclear facilities with
aircraft Ufo was coming over.

3604
01:45:04,500 --> 01:45:05,370
I didn't want one or two.

3605
01:45:05,371 --> 01:45:06,810
I want it half a dozen or a dozen.

3606
01:45:06,811 --> 01:45:07,644
And that's what we have.

3607
01:45:07,860 --> 01:45:10,620
But the more spectacular the cases,

3608
01:45:10,650 --> 01:45:12,030
if it hangs on one person,

3609
01:45:12,390 --> 01:45:12,820
the written,

3610
01:45:12,820 --> 01:45:15,480
and the other question is
where's the corroboration?

3611
01:45:15,720 --> 01:45:18,720
So I think that that's why
we try to focus on that.

3612
01:45:18,930 --> 01:45:19,171
Now,

3613
01:45:19,171 --> 01:45:24,030
I will say that the areas
out in the Nellis range and
nobody by the way cause it

3614
01:45:24,031 --> 01:45:24,811
area 51,

3615
01:45:24,811 --> 01:45:29,811
but this is to say that because somebody's
a poot Mesa s four s three s 12,

3616
01:45:31,110 --> 01:45:36,110
and actually this national reconnaissance
office document from the 1990s lists

3617
01:45:36,960 --> 01:45:38,040
those facilities there,

3618
01:45:38,550 --> 01:45:39,383
um,

3619
01:45:39,780 --> 01:45:40,440
properly,

3620
01:45:40,440 --> 01:45:40,920
you know,

3621
01:45:40,920 --> 01:45:41,500
um,

3622
01:45:41,500 --> 01:45:46,000
well that's after blackjack control
to a apply for additional land.

3623
01:45:46,001 --> 01:45:48,070
Before that they had denied it entire,

3624
01:45:48,071 --> 01:45:48,370
right.

3625
01:45:48,370 --> 01:45:48,700
Right.

3626
01:45:48,700 --> 01:45:51,600
They had to apply for additional land
because people were getting so close that

3627
01:45:51,601 --> 01:45:55,540
they could film a footage of some of
these crafts that they were experimenting

3628
01:45:55,541 --> 01:45:55,811
on.

3629
01:45:55,811 --> 01:45:56,240
And a,

3630
01:45:56,240 --> 01:45:58,120
that's not bullshit if you've ever seen,

3631
01:45:58,340 --> 01:45:58,540
oh,

3632
01:45:58,540 --> 01:45:59,530
the real one knows.

3633
01:45:59,531 --> 01:45:59,681
Yeah,

3634
01:45:59,681 --> 01:46:01,480
no one knows what those things were,

3635
01:46:01,630 --> 01:46:03,940
but the way they were
moving was extraordinary.

3636
01:46:03,950 --> 01:46:06,280
They moved unlike any craft that we know.

3637
01:46:06,700 --> 01:46:07,390
Um,

3638
01:46:07,390 --> 01:46:08,590
I would assume,

3639
01:46:08,640 --> 01:46:09,020
uh,

3640
01:46:09,020 --> 01:46:13,720
that if you look at what we're doing
today in all different parts of the world

3641
01:46:13,721 --> 01:46:14,650
with drones,

3642
01:46:14,980 --> 01:46:17,990
especially these drones that of
Hellfire missiles that you know,

3643
01:46:18,820 --> 01:46:23,050
can be fairly accurate when you
considering that they're being operated by

3644
01:46:23,051 --> 01:46:24,430
someone halfway across the world.

3645
01:46:24,431 --> 01:46:24,860
Right.

3646
01:46:24,860 --> 01:46:25,570
Um,

3647
01:46:25,570 --> 01:46:29,140
that this probably has something to do
with what they were working on back then

3648
01:46:29,141 --> 01:46:32,110
when they're making these things fly
around and do all these crazy turns right

3649
01:46:32,350 --> 01:46:33,100
just in the sky.

3650
01:46:33,100 --> 01:46:33,281
No,

3651
01:46:33,281 --> 01:46:36,700
because of the drones that are being
reported are conventional propulsion

3652
01:46:36,701 --> 01:46:37,181
systems,

3653
01:46:37,181 --> 01:46:41,470
either jets or what we're talking about
are things that are moving in a way that

3654
01:46:41,471 --> 01:46:44,860
is outside the envelope of
normal aerodynamic behavior.

3655
01:46:45,070 --> 01:46:45,431
In other words,

3656
01:46:45,431 --> 01:46:47,950
you cannot take something with a normal,

3657
01:46:48,250 --> 01:46:50,130
a propeller or a jet

3658
01:46:50,130 --> 01:46:54,360
engine and accelerated at 20,000 miles
per hour and make a right hand turn.

3659
01:46:54,420 --> 01:46:56,880
And we have photos and images
of these things doing this.

3660
01:46:57,060 --> 01:46:58,320
So when you're doing that,

3661
01:46:58,321 --> 01:46:58,801
that's going to,

3662
01:46:58,801 --> 01:46:59,011
you know,

3663
01:46:59,011 --> 01:46:59,221
your,

3664
01:46:59,221 --> 01:47:02,250
your brains are going to come out of
your nose if you're a pilot and even a

3665
01:47:02,251 --> 01:47:06,600
conventional object is going to be blown
to smithereens by the inertial forces

3666
01:47:06,601 --> 01:47:09,630
of that kind of a turn and deceleration.

3667
01:47:09,660 --> 01:47:10,081
I think so.

3668
01:47:10,081 --> 01:47:11,400
Are we talking about two
different things though?

3669
01:47:11,520 --> 01:47:11,910
You know,

3670
01:47:11,910 --> 01:47:12,720
I'm not talking about the,

3671
01:47:12,720 --> 01:47:13,553
it's a thing saying,

3672
01:47:13,660 --> 01:47:15,540
but you're talking about
things that had been seen.

3673
01:47:15,541 --> 01:47:16,530
It's in space.

3674
01:47:16,560 --> 01:47:16,861
No,

3675
01:47:16,861 --> 01:47:20,250
I'm talking about things
that had area 51 at area 51,

3676
01:47:20,251 --> 01:47:23,970
and also all over the world that had
been documented moving in this way.

3677
01:47:24,330 --> 01:47:25,230
Those are moving.

3678
01:47:25,260 --> 01:47:27,960
And I'm quoting actually of
General de Brouwer of the,

3679
01:47:27,961 --> 01:47:28,141
uh,

3680
01:47:28,141 --> 01:47:31,740
the Belgian air force chief who said
this is outside the envelope of any

3681
01:47:31,741 --> 01:47:33,780
conventional aerodynamic system.

3682
01:47:33,840 --> 01:47:34,890
I'm not questioning that,

3683
01:47:34,891 --> 01:47:39,030
but what I am saying is that the things
that I've seen as far as videos from

3684
01:47:39,031 --> 01:47:40,710
area 51 with these,

3685
01:47:40,950 --> 01:47:41,281
these,

3686
01:47:41,281 --> 01:47:41,430
uh,

3687
01:47:41,430 --> 01:47:42,600
unidentified objects,

3688
01:47:42,601 --> 01:47:42,841
whatever,

3689
01:47:42,841 --> 01:47:44,280
they were moving across the sky,

3690
01:47:44,490 --> 01:47:45,600
they weren't moving that fast.

3691
01:47:45,601 --> 01:47:46,230
They were oil.

3692
01:47:46,230 --> 01:47:48,630
They were moving conventional speed.

3693
01:47:48,660 --> 01:47:48,751
Oh,

3694
01:47:48,751 --> 01:47:49,261
that's convinced.

3695
01:47:49,261 --> 01:47:49,351
Well,

3696
01:47:49,351 --> 01:47:49,921
so that could be,

3697
01:47:49,921 --> 01:47:52,980
but I'm talking about the things that
I know that have been imaged out there,

3698
01:47:52,981 --> 01:47:55,170
including a daytime object.

3699
01:47:56,220 --> 01:47:57,330
We have a great video.

3700
01:47:57,480 --> 01:47:57,820
What do you,

3701
01:47:57,820 --> 01:47:59,160
what does this video
that you're showing us,

3702
01:47:59,161 --> 01:47:59,401
Brian,

3703
01:47:59,401 --> 01:48:00,234
what was that?

3704
01:48:00,650 --> 01:48:05,650
This is a low year 49 quad copters
and an outdoor formation flight that,

3705
01:48:07,410 --> 01:48:07,940
okay,

3706
01:48:07,940 --> 01:48:08,750
let me see that.

3707
01:48:08,750 --> 01:48:09,091
It's pretty,

3708
01:48:09,091 --> 01:48:10,110
pretty bad as the video.

3709
01:48:10,530 --> 01:48:11,161
This is a,

3710
01:48:11,161 --> 01:48:11,581
these are,

3711
01:48:11,581 --> 01:48:12,180
these are,

3712
01:48:12,180 --> 01:48:12,630
uh,

3713
01:48:12,630 --> 01:48:13,740
conventional.

3714
01:48:13,741 --> 01:48:14,250
Uh,

3715
01:48:14,250 --> 01:48:15,420
you could actually buy these,

3716
01:48:15,421 --> 01:48:15,810
right?

3717
01:48:15,810 --> 01:48:16,080
These,

3718
01:48:16,080 --> 01:48:16,590
uh,

3719
01:48:16,590 --> 01:48:17,180
I,

3720
01:48:17,180 --> 01:48:17,461
I don't,

3721
01:48:17,461 --> 01:48:18,190
I'm not sure.

3722
01:48:18,190 --> 01:48:18,710
Uh,

3723
01:48:18,710 --> 01:48:18,871
they,

3724
01:48:18,871 --> 01:48:20,460
Darpa was this Darpa Shit,

3725
01:48:20,820 --> 01:48:23,070
this is a ars electronica.

3726
01:48:23,730 --> 01:48:24,563
Oh yeah,

3727
01:48:25,800 --> 01:48:26,860
you can buy little miniature.

3728
01:48:27,410 --> 01:48:28,243
Yeah.

3729
01:48:28,290 --> 01:48:29,670
If you've never seen this,

3730
01:48:29,671 --> 01:48:32,910
what they can do now is
really extraordinary.

3731
01:48:33,360 --> 01:48:33,870
I mean,

3732
01:48:33,870 --> 01:48:34,703
this is a,

3733
01:48:34,920 --> 01:48:37,950
all these drones moving
or what do you call them?

3734
01:48:37,980 --> 01:48:39,850
What are the things are just
like little toys almost.

3735
01:48:39,851 --> 01:48:40,684
So they are,

3736
01:48:40,940 --> 01:48:42,260
but I'm sure it's,

3737
01:48:42,261 --> 01:48:43,990
a lot of people saw this
in the sky and was like,

3738
01:48:43,991 --> 01:48:44,281
oh my God,

3739
01:48:44,281 --> 01:48:45,450
what the fuck that and called it,

3740
01:48:45,510 --> 01:48:46,020
you know,

3741
01:48:46,020 --> 01:48:47,790
Ufo is how they move.

3742
01:48:47,820 --> 01:48:48,061
I mean,

3743
01:48:48,061 --> 01:48:49,470
this is really amazing stuff.

3744
01:48:49,500 --> 01:48:50,261
They move in a,

3745
01:48:50,261 --> 01:48:53,860
in a geometric pattern in
the sky that mimics galaxies.

3746
01:48:54,030 --> 01:48:54,690
All right,

3747
01:48:54,690 --> 01:48:55,200
cool.

3748
01:48:55,200 --> 01:48:57,420
So we know that there's some things that,

3749
01:48:57,421 --> 01:48:57,601
I mean,

3750
01:48:57,601 --> 01:48:59,190
these are obviously terrestrial crafts.

3751
01:48:59,220 --> 01:48:59,791
This is something,

3752
01:48:59,791 --> 01:49:00,000
look,

3753
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:00,511
look what they're doing.

3754
01:49:00,511 --> 01:49:00,691
I mean,

3755
01:49:00,691 --> 01:49:01,524
that's amazing.

3756
01:49:02,670 --> 01:49:06,030
This is not ufs courses identified flying.

3757
01:49:06,031 --> 01:49:06,211
I mean,

3758
01:49:06,211 --> 01:49:09,240
not everything that people see that
they don't know what it is is a Ufo.

3759
01:49:09,240 --> 01:49:10,073
I mean it's an,

3760
01:49:10,290 --> 01:49:10,590
well,

3761
01:49:10,590 --> 01:49:12,720
it's unidentified to them
and it may be flying,

3762
01:49:13,080 --> 01:49:16,180
but you know what I'm talking about
things that are really quite amazing.

3763
01:49:16,181 --> 01:49:20,310
It's like this one photograph we have
of this triangle that's going like this

3764
01:49:20,311 --> 01:49:23,160
and it makes a right hand turn and go
and it's going in more of a staff or a

3765
01:49:23,161 --> 01:49:24,180
video photo.

3766
01:49:24,930 --> 01:49:25,591
Can we see this?

3767
01:49:25,591 --> 01:49:26,424
I want to,

3768
01:49:26,560 --> 01:49:26,940
uh,

3769
01:49:26,940 --> 01:49:27,773
it's,

3770
01:49:28,080 --> 01:49:30,930
I don't know where it's
going to be in the film,

3771
01:49:30,931 --> 01:49:31,980
but it's going to be in the film,

3772
01:49:31,981 --> 01:49:32,250
but it's,

3773
01:49:32,250 --> 01:49:33,600
it's available online isn't it?

3774
01:49:33,660 --> 01:49:34,170
I mean it must,

3775
01:49:34,170 --> 01:49:34,920
um,

3776
01:49:34,920 --> 01:49:35,730
I don't know.

3777
01:49:35,730 --> 01:49:37,230
I only so long as it's been around for,

3778
01:49:37,950 --> 01:49:39,150
I'll have to look it up made,

3779
01:49:39,640 --> 01:49:41,160
I don't have to cut of the film in here,

3780
01:49:41,161 --> 01:49:41,990
but you know,

3781
01:49:41,990 --> 01:49:42,720
this is one,

3782
01:49:42,720 --> 01:49:42,991
you know,

3783
01:49:42,991 --> 01:49:43,830
there are a number of these,

3784
01:49:43,860 --> 01:49:45,450
but this is a very
compelling piece of evidence.

3785
01:49:46,110 --> 01:49:46,590
Amazing.

3786
01:49:46,590 --> 01:49:48,300
Why wouldn't you that online immediately

3787
01:49:48,390 --> 01:49:48,751
and say,

3788
01:49:48,751 --> 01:49:48,931
hey,

3789
01:49:48,931 --> 01:49:49,770
you got to look at this.

3790
01:49:49,771 --> 01:49:50,970
This is a compelling piece.

3791
01:49:51,370 --> 01:49:52,690
I think it is online somewhere,

3792
01:49:52,720 --> 01:49:53,231
but I mean,

3793
01:49:53,231 --> 01:49:54,400
I just can't tell you where,

3794
01:49:54,550 --> 01:49:55,150
um,

3795
01:49:55,150 --> 01:49:55,511
you know,

3796
01:49:55,511 --> 01:49:55,850
we,

3797
01:49:55,850 --> 01:49:57,790
we have thousands of pages on our website.

3798
01:49:57,791 --> 01:49:58,330
You can go,

3799
01:49:58,330 --> 01:50:01,300
if you go to a serious disclosure.com
you can click through and there's a whole

3800
01:50:01,301 --> 01:50:02,980
photo gallery and all kinds of stuff.

3801
01:50:03,050 --> 01:50:03,551
Are we okay?

3802
01:50:03,551 --> 01:50:03,981
Go ahead and go.

3803
01:50:03,981 --> 01:50:06,370
I don't know if this particular
one is in that photo gallery,

3804
01:50:06,371 --> 01:50:07,240
but for example,

3805
01:50:07,510 --> 01:50:08,161
you look at the,

3806
01:50:08,161 --> 01:50:10,690
the Vancouver Island
photograph of a few years ago,

3807
01:50:10,691 --> 01:50:14,920
I don't even think it was in the
eighties daytime disc with a dome.

3808
01:50:15,280 --> 01:50:16,600
It is not Photoshop.

3809
01:50:17,070 --> 01:50:18,940
It was studied at Nasa Ames.

3810
01:50:19,080 --> 01:50:19,600
Um,

3811
01:50:19,600 --> 01:50:22,180
it's probably the clearest
photograph ever taken broad daylight.

3812
01:50:22,890 --> 01:50:23,920
And you know,

3813
01:50:24,090 --> 01:50:24,910
what is that?

3814
01:50:24,910 --> 01:50:25,181
Well,

3815
01:50:25,181 --> 01:50:25,571
you know,

3816
01:50:25,571 --> 01:50:25,661
it,

3817
01:50:25,661 --> 01:50:28,960
it's just like these ones from Belgium
where you have these photographs of these

3818
01:50:28,961 --> 01:50:33,100
big triangular objects and their photo
and video of those matching up with radar

3819
01:50:33,101 --> 01:50:34,870
cases in jet pilots chasing them.

3820
01:50:35,140 --> 01:50:36,820
I'm talking about those kinds of things.

3821
01:50:37,120 --> 01:50:37,953
Um,

3822
01:50:38,560 --> 01:50:38,750
there,

3823
01:50:38,750 --> 01:50:41,320
there's actually more than people
can imagine that's out there.

3824
01:50:41,410 --> 01:50:41,651
Okay.

3825
01:50:41,651 --> 01:50:45,250
So there's enough of these
things where if you look at,

3826
01:50:45,330 --> 01:50:46,090
uh,

3827
01:50:46,090 --> 01:50:46,390
B,

3828
01:50:46,390 --> 01:50:51,390
believe Michio Kaku said 5% of all Ufo
sightings are completely unexplainable

3829
01:50:52,421 --> 01:50:53,870
defined laws of physics and,

3830
01:50:54,070 --> 01:50:56,440
and may possibly be in his opinion,

3831
01:50:56,441 --> 01:50:58,000
something that we don't understand

3832
01:50:58,490 --> 01:50:58,841
possibly.

3833
01:50:58,841 --> 01:50:59,870
Cause that's the one I'm talking about.

3834
01:50:59,900 --> 01:51:00,470
The other stuff.

3835
01:51:00,470 --> 01:51:00,690
Yeah.

3836
01:51:00,690 --> 01:51:01,220
I'm curious,

3837
01:51:01,220 --> 01:51:02,420
what do you think they're doing here

3838
01:51:04,840 --> 01:51:07,070
since the $64 trillion question?

3839
01:51:07,200 --> 01:51:07,500
Yeah,

3840
01:51:07,500 --> 01:51:08,333
I think,

3841
01:51:09,440 --> 01:51:10,610
I think there are a number of things.

3842
01:51:10,640 --> 01:51:11,473
Number one,

3843
01:51:11,840 --> 01:51:13,850
I don't think they're new at all.

3844
01:51:14,120 --> 01:51:14,620
Um,

3845
01:51:14,620 --> 01:51:14,760
I,

3846
01:51:14,760 --> 01:51:16,060
I don't think there's a new phenomenon,

3847
01:51:16,090 --> 01:51:20,090
there's enough material out there from
ancient times that would indicate that

3848
01:51:20,300 --> 01:51:23,360
these objects have been
around since recorded history.

3849
01:51:23,361 --> 01:51:24,620
I mentioned this earlier in the show,

3850
01:51:25,100 --> 01:51:25,970
but secondly,

3851
01:51:25,971 --> 01:51:28,340
I think this stage of our evolution,

3852
01:51:28,970 --> 01:51:33,890
the civilizations are rather concerned
about our potential to destroy this

3853
01:51:33,891 --> 01:51:35,620
planet and ourselves,

3854
01:51:35,630 --> 01:51:37,520
but also the fact we're going into space.

3855
01:51:37,760 --> 01:51:39,020
We have not become peaceful.

3856
01:51:39,440 --> 01:51:43,100
And in the classified projects we have
things way beyond the international space

3857
01:51:43,101 --> 01:51:47,720
station so that we could become an
existential threat to other planets

3858
01:51:47,721 --> 01:51:48,500
potentially.

3859
01:51:48,500 --> 01:51:51,140
So I think that there
is a concern about that.

3860
01:51:51,140 --> 01:51:51,973
And I think that,

3861
01:51:52,100 --> 01:51:52,320
you know,

3862
01:51:52,320 --> 01:51:52,611
love your,

3863
01:51:52,611 --> 01:51:53,480
all these movies,

3864
01:51:53,481 --> 01:51:53,721
you know,

3865
01:51:53,721 --> 01:51:57,440
battle Los Angeles and Independence
Day and Blah Blah Blah avatar.

3866
01:51:58,070 --> 01:51:58,521
You know,

3867
01:51:58,521 --> 01:51:58,900
it's like,

3868
01:51:58,900 --> 01:51:59,240
well yeah,

3869
01:51:59,240 --> 01:51:59,840
and it's such,

3870
01:51:59,840 --> 01:52:00,471
to me it's like,

3871
01:52:00,471 --> 01:52:00,801
okay,

3872
01:52:00,801 --> 01:52:01,634
yeah.

3873
01:52:01,860 --> 01:52:04,730
It's like when I went to Wright Patterson
air force base where they had the,

3874
01:52:04,810 --> 01:52:05,020
the,

3875
01:52:05,020 --> 01:52:06,170
the blue room that,

3876
01:52:06,180 --> 01:52:08,030
that Barry Goldwater
tried center to go water,

3877
01:52:08,031 --> 01:52:09,420
tried to get in and uh,

3878
01:52:09,560 --> 01:52:10,570
you know the story.

3879
01:52:10,870 --> 01:52:11,360
Yeah.

3880
01:52:11,360 --> 01:52:11,631
Yeah.

3881
01:52:11,631 --> 01:52:12,261
What wasn't that,

3882
01:52:12,261 --> 01:52:12,740
but,

3883
01:52:12,740 --> 01:52:13,191
but the,

3884
01:52:13,191 --> 01:52:15,770
the thing is is that I'm hangry
teen Wright Patterson Air Force,

3885
01:52:15,771 --> 01:52:16,040
but yeah,

3886
01:52:16,040 --> 01:52:17,700
but this is a different thing.

3887
01:52:17,701 --> 01:52:18,740
At Wright Patterson Air Force base,

3888
01:52:18,940 --> 01:52:19,850
it was called the Blue Room.

3889
01:52:20,180 --> 01:52:24,110
Is that where supposedly the Roswell
wreckage was the air material command.

3890
01:52:24,111 --> 01:52:25,430
And then when I was there,

3891
01:52:25,750 --> 01:52:26,230
by the way,

3892
01:52:26,230 --> 01:52:29,320
very compelling piece of evidence and
it might've been something serious going

3893
01:52:29,321 --> 01:52:30,510
on other than a weather balloon.

3894
01:52:30,520 --> 01:52:34,630
The fact that two separate planes we
use to send this wreckage because the,

3895
01:52:34,631 --> 01:52:36,130
in case one of them went down,

3896
01:52:36,131 --> 01:52:36,520
right.

3897
01:52:36,520 --> 01:52:38,530
It was so historically significant.

3898
01:52:38,680 --> 01:52:39,280
I have that,

3899
01:52:39,280 --> 01:52:39,970
um,

3900
01:52:39,970 --> 01:52:41,020
that newspaper,

3901
01:52:41,050 --> 01:52:42,220
the Roswell daily record,

3902
01:52:42,221 --> 01:52:46,460
I have that page on my wall in my
house and I looked at it all the time.

3903
01:52:46,461 --> 01:52:47,600
It's a fascinating,

3904
01:52:48,020 --> 01:52:48,540
I mean it's,

3905
01:52:48,540 --> 01:52:53,180
it's essentially a press release by
the military saying we've recovered a

3906
01:52:53,181 --> 01:52:54,920
crashed disk before they pulled it back.

3907
01:52:54,990 --> 01:52:55,823
Yeah.

3908
01:52:55,870 --> 01:52:57,050
It's amazing because that's,

3909
01:52:57,051 --> 01:52:57,620
um,

3910
01:52:57,620 --> 01:52:58,880
that's a big statement,

3911
01:52:59,060 --> 01:52:59,391
you know,

3912
01:52:59,391 --> 01:52:59,810
I mean,

3913
01:52:59,810 --> 01:53:01,880
you look at all the
things that could've been,

3914
01:53:01,910 --> 01:53:03,230
they could've been wrong about like,

3915
01:53:03,260 --> 01:53:03,441
oh,

3916
01:53:03,441 --> 01:53:04,880
it could have been something else.

3917
01:53:04,881 --> 01:53:05,270
And the,

3918
01:53:05,270 --> 01:53:05,541
but the,

3919
01:53:05,541 --> 01:53:10,070
the fact that they came out and said
it's a crashed disk that had never been

3920
01:53:10,071 --> 01:53:10,630
done before,

3921
01:53:10,630 --> 01:53:10,780
that,

3922
01:53:10,780 --> 01:53:12,540
that really was one of the,

3923
01:53:12,541 --> 01:53:12,801
the,

3924
01:53:12,801 --> 01:53:13,640
the first,

3925
01:53:13,700 --> 01:53:15,950
I think some heads rolled
over that press release.

3926
01:53:15,950 --> 01:53:16,783
But uh,

3927
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:20,300
cause they had to pull it back and they
did that ridiculous dog and pony show

3928
01:53:20,301 --> 01:53:23,990
where they brought out this shitty
looking aluminum boy kind of looks like a

3929
01:53:23,991 --> 01:53:24,801
mylar thing.

3930
01:53:24,801 --> 01:53:25,720
It's hilarious that,

3931
01:53:25,721 --> 01:53:25,860
that,

3932
01:53:25,860 --> 01:53:26,720
that's quite hilarious.

3933
01:53:26,721 --> 01:53:27,590
And the government.

3934
01:53:27,591 --> 01:53:28,424
I've always,

3935
01:53:28,760 --> 01:53:29,210
I mean,

3936
01:53:29,210 --> 01:53:32,290
if you just look at the history of
deception that the government has in,

3937
01:53:32,291 --> 01:53:35,380
in dealing with the American
public from the get go,

3938
01:53:35,381 --> 01:53:39,020
and whether it's with the Gulf of
Tonkin incident or whether it's the,

3939
01:53:39,050 --> 01:53:40,070
what happened with the,

3940
01:53:40,071 --> 01:53:45,071
the contrast and the Sandinistas using
taxpayer dollars and black ops from

3941
01:53:45,440 --> 01:53:49,250
selling cocaine in the ghettos of
Los Angeles to fund rebel armies.

3942
01:53:49,450 --> 01:53:50,290
If you just look,

3943
01:53:50,420 --> 01:53:51,980
you've got to know they're
not telling the truth.

3944
01:53:52,010 --> 01:53:55,130
Why would they tell the truth if
it was just a weather balloon?

3945
01:53:55,310 --> 01:53:57,930
What they really put on this fucking
dog and pony show where they'd have a,

3946
01:53:57,931 --> 01:53:59,750
a general sit there and,

3947
01:53:59,870 --> 01:54:00,561
or was it colonel,

3948
01:54:00,561 --> 01:54:03,740
whoever it was on his knees pointing
out all the retro look a list.

3949
01:54:03,920 --> 01:54:05,050
He is just record.

3950
01:54:05,060 --> 01:54:05,341
Right,

3951
01:54:05,341 --> 01:54:05,450
right.

3952
01:54:05,450 --> 01:54:05,620
Well,

3953
01:54:05,620 --> 01:54:06,760
that's what colonel courses said.

3954
01:54:06,770 --> 01:54:06,970
That's,

3955
01:54:06,970 --> 01:54:07,310
you know,

3956
01:54:07,310 --> 01:54:07,930
he was,

3957
01:54:07,930 --> 01:54:10,150
there's no question that this
was something very legitimate.

3958
01:54:10,151 --> 01:54:10,750
And,

3959
01:54:10,750 --> 01:54:11,081
and,

3960
01:54:11,081 --> 01:54:11,261
uh,

3961
01:54:11,261 --> 01:54:11,770
in fact,

3962
01:54:11,770 --> 01:54:11,861
uh,

3963
01:54:11,861 --> 01:54:12,161
you know,

3964
01:54:12,161 --> 01:54:13,090
when Barry Goldwater,

3965
01:54:13,150 --> 01:54:16,510
senator Goldwater had McCain seat,

3966
01:54:16,730 --> 01:54:17,320
um,

3967
01:54:17,320 --> 01:54:19,480
before John Mccain took it in Arizona.

3968
01:54:19,990 --> 01:54:23,770
I was at his home some years ago and
he had left the Senate and he told me,

3969
01:54:23,771 --> 01:54:24,041
he said,

3970
01:54:24,041 --> 01:54:24,820
look,

3971
01:54:24,820 --> 01:54:26,920
he says it was a God damn mistake.

3972
01:54:26,921 --> 01:54:30,280
Then it was like God damn mistake
now that this was ever kept secret,

3973
01:54:30,640 --> 01:54:32,530
but he was an air force reserve general.

3974
01:54:32,560 --> 01:54:34,390
And he told me that
Senator Goldwater said,

3975
01:54:34,391 --> 01:54:34,660
look,

3976
01:54:34,660 --> 01:54:35,920
I asked Curtis Lemay,

3977
01:54:35,921 --> 01:54:39,460
General Lemay to get me into the
blue room at Wright Patterson,

3978
01:54:40,030 --> 01:54:40,271
uh,

3979
01:54:40,271 --> 01:54:43,300
because I wanted to see this stuff was
he had heard reports from other pilots

3980
01:54:43,301 --> 01:54:46,300
about Ufo encounters and senator,

3981
01:54:46,330 --> 01:54:46,600
uh,

3982
01:54:46,600 --> 01:54:46,870
go,

3983
01:54:46,870 --> 01:54:46,961
uh,

3984
01:54:46,961 --> 01:54:49,270
go order a told me that courtesy may said,

3985
01:54:49,271 --> 01:54:50,104
look,

3986
01:54:50,260 --> 01:54:50,800
Barry,

3987
01:54:50,800 --> 01:54:52,840
I can't even get into that area anymore.

3988
01:54:52,930 --> 01:54:55,000
And if you ever ask me about this again,

3989
01:54:55,150 --> 01:54:59,020
I will personally see that you were
court marshaled out of the air force,

3990
01:54:59,410 --> 01:55:04,410
reserves this to a city sitting senator
and a guy who had run for president of

3991
01:55:04,421 --> 01:55:07,330
course in 1964 and it actually happened.

3992
01:55:07,630 --> 01:55:08,020
Yeah,

3993
01:55:08,020 --> 01:55:08,291
no,

3994
01:55:08,291 --> 01:55:08,811
that's,

3995
01:55:08,811 --> 01:55:09,250
you know,

3996
01:55:09,250 --> 01:55:10,090
amazing,

3997
01:55:10,150 --> 01:55:11,350
amazing stories.

3998
01:55:11,500 --> 01:55:11,711
Well,

3999
01:55:11,711 --> 01:55:15,370
I was sitting there with the senator
and I have a guy who was there with me.

4000
01:55:15,371 --> 01:55:16,700
And you know what I,

4001
01:55:16,720 --> 01:55:17,920
when I asked him was,

4002
01:55:18,530 --> 01:55:20,440
was Curtis Lemay serious?

4003
01:55:20,470 --> 01:55:20,831
He said,

4004
01:55:20,831 --> 01:55:21,370
yeah,

4005
01:55:21,370 --> 01:55:22,203
like a heart attack.

4006
01:55:22,210 --> 01:55:22,511
He says,

4007
01:55:22,511 --> 01:55:23,920
I never brought it up again.

4008
01:55:24,490 --> 01:55:26,980
And so the question becomes,

4009
01:55:27,220 --> 01:55:27,641
you know,

4010
01:55:27,641 --> 01:55:31,900
when you have someone like Curtis Lemay
who admits and if you'll Google who he

4011
01:55:31,901 --> 01:55:32,734
was,

4012
01:55:33,340 --> 01:55:36,580
who admits to the fact that at a
certain point even he was being kind of

4013
01:55:37,270 --> 01:55:39,740
sidelined in terms of access of it,

4014
01:55:39,790 --> 01:55:43,320
this information and then threatens and
said something like that to a sitting

4015
01:55:43,321 --> 01:55:44,010
powerful US

4016
01:55:44,010 --> 01:55:45,090
senator did.

4017
01:55:45,091 --> 01:55:46,110
They were good friends.

4018
01:55:46,111 --> 01:55:46,321
I mean,

4019
01:55:46,321 --> 01:55:47,160
they were buddies.

4020
01:55:47,550 --> 01:55:48,180
Um,

4021
01:55:48,180 --> 01:55:48,511
you know,

4022
01:55:48,511 --> 01:55:48,691
there,

4023
01:55:48,691 --> 01:55:49,080
there's,

4024
01:55:49,080 --> 01:55:53,040
there's something going on here and I've
heard too many accounts like that from

4025
01:55:53,041 --> 01:55:54,000
these sorts of people.

4026
01:55:54,030 --> 01:55:54,630
And,

4027
01:55:54,630 --> 01:55:54,841
uh,

4028
01:55:54,841 --> 01:55:55,674
I think it's a,

4029
01:55:56,730 --> 01:55:58,650
it's a time for people to understand that,

4030
01:55:59,160 --> 01:55:59,993
you know,

4031
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:03,480
ruthless people are out there
and they do this sort of stuff.

4032
01:56:03,810 --> 01:56:04,170
So,

4033
01:56:04,170 --> 01:56:04,710
you know,

4034
01:56:04,710 --> 01:56:05,220
when,

4035
01:56:05,220 --> 01:56:05,670
when,

4036
01:56:05,670 --> 01:56:06,360
uh,

4037
01:56:06,360 --> 01:56:11,100
what happened for the last 60 years
continues to go on and on and on.

4038
01:56:11,360 --> 01:56:11,700
You,

4039
01:56:11,700 --> 01:56:12,533
you,

4040
01:56:12,640 --> 01:56:13,030
the,

4041
01:56:13,030 --> 01:56:16,020
the people who try to move into this,

4042
01:56:16,021 --> 01:56:18,170
who were politicians and the,

4043
01:56:18,300 --> 01:56:20,160
the same boasts all the
senator Goldwater did

4044
01:56:21,080 --> 01:56:26,080
these incredibly powerful technologically
advanced beings that come here from

4045
01:56:26,181 --> 01:56:30,110
another planet and are concerned with the
fact that we've developed the power to

4046
01:56:30,111 --> 01:56:30,950
blow ourselves up,

4047
01:56:30,951 --> 01:56:33,230
but yet lack the understanding,

4048
01:56:33,231 --> 01:56:34,340
the intellect or the,

4049
01:56:34,341 --> 01:56:34,611
the,

4050
01:56:34,611 --> 01:56:38,480
the spiritual capacity to recognize what
the dangers and the repercussions of

4051
01:56:38,481 --> 01:56:39,440
those actions would be.

4052
01:56:39,670 --> 01:56:39,980
What,

4053
01:56:39,980 --> 01:56:40,520
what are they,

4054
01:56:40,520 --> 01:56:41,353
are they,

4055
01:56:41,480 --> 01:56:42,980
is anybody communicating with them?

4056
01:56:43,010 --> 01:56:44,810
Does anybody have a message from them?

4057
01:56:44,980 --> 01:56:45,360
Does,

4058
01:56:45,360 --> 01:56:47,600
is there anything that they say,

4059
01:56:47,601 --> 01:56:50,270
we'll be done if we keep fucking around?

4060
01:56:50,510 --> 01:56:50,841
I mean,

4061
01:56:50,841 --> 01:56:51,560
is there,

4062
01:56:51,560 --> 01:56:51,891
uh,

4063
01:56:51,891 --> 01:56:52,290
is,

4064
01:56:52,290 --> 01:56:52,630
is,

4065
01:56:52,630 --> 01:56:53,463
is there like

4066
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:54,833
any,

4067
01:56:55,370 --> 01:56:55,910
any,

4068
01:56:55,910 --> 01:56:59,450
any doctrine that they're
trying to push on us?

4069
01:57:00,080 --> 01:57:00,201
Oh,

4070
01:57:00,201 --> 01:57:01,330
I don't know if there's any doctor,

4071
01:57:01,331 --> 01:57:03,770
and I think they're
waiting for us to reach,

4072
01:57:03,800 --> 01:57:04,431
you know,

4073
01:57:04,431 --> 01:57:05,200
uh,

4074
01:57:05,200 --> 01:57:05,820
uh,

4075
01:57:05,820 --> 01:57:07,390
you mentioned this physicist Mitch got,

4076
01:57:07,630 --> 01:57:08,000
you know,

4077
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:12,230
a level one civilization or a level to
where we began to behave in a halfway

4078
01:57:12,231 --> 01:57:15,560
civilized way so that we could
be quite open and our contact.

4079
01:57:15,800 --> 01:57:16,281
But I think,

4080
01:57:16,281 --> 01:57:16,461
you know,

4081
01:57:16,461 --> 01:57:17,570
I think everyone always says,

4082
01:57:17,600 --> 01:57:17,811
well,

4083
01:57:17,811 --> 01:57:20,150
why don't they just land on the
White House lawn or so I said,

4084
01:57:20,151 --> 01:57:20,361
yeah,

4085
01:57:20,361 --> 01:57:20,720
right,

4086
01:57:20,720 --> 01:57:21,640
who's White House?

4087
01:57:22,070 --> 01:57:22,860
Right?

4088
01:57:22,860 --> 01:57:25,110
Humans who says we rule it's American,

4089
01:57:25,140 --> 01:57:25,380
right?

4090
01:57:25,380 --> 01:57:25,920
Yeah.

4091
01:57:25,920 --> 01:57:26,510
Yeah.

4092
01:57:26,510 --> 01:57:26,991
So,

4093
01:57:26,991 --> 01:57:27,800
um,

4094
01:57:27,800 --> 01:57:29,060
maybe the White House in Bogota,

4095
01:57:29,061 --> 01:57:29,750
Colombia,

4096
01:57:29,750 --> 01:57:32,360
I think the question is,

4097
01:57:32,590 --> 01:57:33,423
is,

4098
01:57:33,830 --> 01:57:34,610
uh,

4099
01:57:34,610 --> 01:57:35,061
it turns,

4100
01:57:35,061 --> 01:57:35,200
it,

4101
01:57:35,200 --> 01:57:35,720
it the,

4102
01:57:35,720 --> 01:57:37,190
the whole issue upside down.

4103
01:57:37,220 --> 01:57:41,000
What do we have to do as a
people and the civilization to,

4104
01:57:41,180 --> 01:57:41,900
uh,

4105
01:57:41,900 --> 01:57:46,900
be able to go into space and have open
contact with these civilizations quite an

4106
01:57:48,220 --> 01:57:51,470
in an overt way as
opposed to episodic way.

4107
01:57:51,980 --> 01:57:54,260
And I think that requires us to begin,

4108
01:57:54,290 --> 01:57:55,610
begin to behave peacefully.

4109
01:57:55,730 --> 01:57:59,330
It certainly requires that we not begin
to weaponize space and that we stopped

4110
01:57:59,331 --> 01:58:01,580
doing things that are
incredibly self destructive.

4111
01:58:02,030 --> 01:58:02,660
Um,

4112
01:58:02,660 --> 01:58:03,171
but I,

4113
01:58:03,171 --> 01:58:03,441
you know,

4114
01:58:03,441 --> 01:58:05,060
the idea that they're
going to land here in,

4115
01:58:05,061 --> 01:58:05,541
in four,

4116
01:58:05,541 --> 01:58:08,480
it's like us going to Afghanistan think
we're going to impose Jeffersonian

4117
01:58:08,481 --> 01:58:11,330
democracy on a medieval feudal society.

4118
01:58:11,900 --> 01:58:12,733
Really,

4119
01:58:12,950 --> 01:58:14,060
that never has worked.

4120
01:58:14,061 --> 01:58:17,210
So I think these civilizations are smart
enough to know that that isn't the way

4121
01:58:17,211 --> 01:58:18,200
this is going to happen.

4122
01:58:18,380 --> 01:58:19,100
The humans.

4123
01:58:19,100 --> 01:58:19,700
But the,

4124
01:58:19,700 --> 01:58:24,620
the problem is that I kind of think we're
running out of time to get some things

4125
01:58:24,621 --> 01:58:25,220
right.

4126
01:58:25,220 --> 01:58:27,470
Things that should have been
fixed a hundred years ago,

4127
01:58:27,680 --> 01:58:29,510
like w living together peacefully,

4128
01:58:29,511 --> 01:58:32,540
bringing out these technologies
that we don't destroy the biosphere,

4129
01:58:32,720 --> 01:58:34,370
eliminating poverty in the world.

4130
01:58:34,371 --> 01:58:34,521
You know,

4131
01:58:34,521 --> 01:58:35,360
48% of the,

4132
01:58:35,400 --> 01:58:35,560
the,

4133
01:58:35,560 --> 01:58:37,910
the public doesn't have a pot to pee in.

4134
01:58:37,940 --> 01:58:38,301
Literally,

4135
01:58:38,301 --> 01:58:40,880
they don't have indoor
plumbing on this planet.

4136
01:58:40,881 --> 01:58:42,130
40% of the 7 billion

4137
01:58:42,130 --> 01:58:43,120
people that people don't know that.

4138
01:58:43,480 --> 01:58:44,170
So,

4139
01:58:44,170 --> 01:58:45,003
you know,

4140
01:58:45,220 --> 01:58:48,130
I think that until we began to
fix some of these larger problems,

4141
01:58:48,131 --> 01:58:53,131
and the good news about all of this
is that it's fixable and the means the

4142
01:58:53,561 --> 01:58:56,980
technologies to do that or
are already in existence.

4143
01:58:57,400 --> 01:59:00,580
So if they're already in existence
and the science has been studied in

4144
01:59:00,581 --> 01:59:02,890
suppressed and studied in
suppressed for decades,

4145
01:59:03,250 --> 01:59:03,461
it,

4146
01:59:03,461 --> 01:59:05,590
it means that we as a people
have to come together and say,

4147
01:59:05,750 --> 01:59:06,490
all right,

4148
01:59:06,490 --> 01:59:07,510
we're going to do this.

4149
01:59:07,620 --> 01:59:07,800
And,

4150
01:59:07,800 --> 01:59:08,081
and the,

4151
01:59:08,081 --> 01:59:08,351
and the,

4152
01:59:08,351 --> 01:59:09,430
I think this is why the,

4153
01:59:09,431 --> 01:59:09,581
the,

4154
01:59:09,581 --> 01:59:12,880
the sort of hate to use
the word activist advocacy,

4155
01:59:13,030 --> 01:59:17,560
part of what we're doing is that people
are always expecting someone else to do

4156
01:59:17,561 --> 01:59:18,394
this,

4157
01:59:18,400 --> 01:59:19,233
you know?

4158
01:59:19,330 --> 01:59:20,163
Um,

4159
01:59:20,800 --> 01:59:23,020
and I think people have to say no,

4160
01:59:23,320 --> 01:59:27,850
each of us have to be responsible for
the planet and for our future and kind of

4161
01:59:27,851 --> 01:59:28,930
creating a good future.

4162
01:59:29,410 --> 01:59:31,180
You can't look to big brother to do it.

4163
01:59:31,181 --> 01:59:34,570
And I don't think you should look to the
ets to do it and not that they're not

4164
01:59:34,571 --> 01:59:35,860
going to help us if we,

4165
01:59:35,861 --> 01:59:37,150
at some point we reached a point of,

4166
01:59:37,160 --> 01:59:38,980
of heavily into functional.

4167
01:59:39,070 --> 01:59:40,540
It's opposed to dysfunctional.

4168
01:59:41,050 --> 01:59:41,883
But I,

4169
01:59:41,950 --> 01:59:44,260
I think the prime movers
have to be the people.

4170
01:59:44,290 --> 01:59:44,411
We,

4171
01:59:44,411 --> 01:59:45,360
the people and you know,

4172
01:59:45,370 --> 01:59:46,490
my mom's family were,

4173
01:59:46,510 --> 01:59:50,860
were some of the original people in the
American revolution with that terrible

4174
01:59:50,861 --> 01:59:54,400
to say we were in the front of the
first prisoner of war with the British.

4175
01:59:54,401 --> 01:59:54,641
But,

4176
01:59:54,641 --> 01:59:55,420
um,

4177
01:59:55,420 --> 01:59:56,860
but I think about the fact that,

4178
01:59:56,861 --> 01:59:57,011
you know,

4179
01:59:57,011 --> 02:00:00,850
here you had this ragtag bunch of people
in the American revolution taking on

4180
02:00:00,851 --> 02:00:02,710
the most powerful navy,

4181
02:00:02,711 --> 02:00:04,810
most powerful empire in the world at time,

4182
02:00:04,811 --> 02:00:05,644
the British empire.

4183
02:00:06,310 --> 02:00:07,143
Um,

4184
02:00:07,600 --> 02:00:08,540
I think people have to,

4185
02:00:08,541 --> 02:00:11,920
to see that within the human spirit
we have the means to do this.

4186
02:00:12,250 --> 02:00:15,880
And a lot of people give too much power
to where I don't think it should be

4187
02:00:15,881 --> 02:00:16,714
provided,

4188
02:00:16,920 --> 02:00:17,620
um,

4189
02:00:17,620 --> 02:00:21,190
to these covert groups and
these sort of co cartels.

4190
02:00:21,490 --> 02:00:22,060
I think,

4191
02:00:22,060 --> 02:00:22,421
again,

4192
02:00:22,421 --> 02:00:27,160
I'm getting back to this
idea of empowerment where
we have exactly the power

4193
02:00:27,220 --> 02:00:28,990
we're willing to manifest and no more.

4194
02:00:29,200 --> 02:00:31,900
But if we're going to sit on our hands
and expect someone else to do it,

4195
02:00:32,110 --> 02:00:32,890
we're in trouble.

4196
02:00:32,890 --> 02:00:34,150
And there's been too much of that.

4197
02:00:34,210 --> 02:00:34,471
And,

4198
02:00:34,471 --> 02:00:34,930
and there's,

4199
02:00:34,930 --> 02:00:35,950
there needs to be,

4200
02:00:36,390 --> 02:00:37,060
um,

4201
02:00:37,060 --> 02:00:38,530
I guess a moral courage here.

4202
02:00:38,531 --> 02:00:38,780
And I,

4203
02:00:38,780 --> 02:00:39,390
I,

4204
02:00:39,390 --> 02:00:39,611
you know,

4205
02:00:39,611 --> 02:00:40,690
this is what sickened me about,

4206
02:00:40,691 --> 02:00:40,871
you know,

4207
02:00:40,871 --> 02:00:43,340
the politics of the media
and then all these scandals,

4208
02:00:43,341 --> 02:00:43,571
you're like,

4209
02:00:43,571 --> 02:00:46,120
you were talking about the
with betray us and you know,

4210
02:00:46,121 --> 02:00:47,860
during the Clinton era of
the Monica Lewinsky thing,

4211
02:00:47,861 --> 02:00:48,694
I call it the,

4212
02:00:48,750 --> 02:00:50,230
the blowjob heard round the world.

4213
02:00:50,530 --> 02:00:51,363
Um,

4214
02:00:51,640 --> 02:00:53,440
that it's just so much nonsense.

4215
02:00:53,970 --> 02:00:54,310
Uh,

4216
02:00:54,310 --> 02:00:57,640
whereas these big issues or
the moral issues as I see it,

4217
02:00:57,770 --> 02:00:58,603
you know,

4218
02:00:58,900 --> 02:01:03,900
I think if you look at us as a being
as an entity and our progress in this,

4219
02:01:05,081 --> 02:01:05,440
uh,

4220
02:01:05,440 --> 02:01:06,340
on this planet,

4221
02:01:06,370 --> 02:01:11,370
it's so staggering over such a short
period of time that I think our minds,

4222
02:01:12,910 --> 02:01:16,480
our ability to pass down information,

4223
02:01:16,810 --> 02:01:18,700
all of these things lag behind.

4224
02:01:18,701 --> 02:01:18,911
We're,

4225
02:01:18,911 --> 02:01:22,540
we're essentially waking up
in the middle of history as a,

4226
02:01:22,541 --> 02:01:22,931
as a,

4227
02:01:22,931 --> 02:01:23,441
as a,

4228
02:01:23,441 --> 02:01:25,660
as a race of beings,

4229
02:01:25,750 --> 02:01:26,530
humans,

4230
02:01:26,530 --> 02:01:30,310
we're waking up in the middle
of a massive amount of momentum.

4231
02:01:30,490 --> 02:01:31,450
As you're born,

4232
02:01:31,540 --> 02:01:36,540
you are born into a race that is moving
in an incredibly powerful direction that

4233
02:01:37,360 --> 02:01:38,800
it's very hard to stop.

4234
02:01:38,840 --> 02:01:43,840
And it's also the same animal that just
twenty thousand thirty thousand go back

4235
02:01:45,081 --> 02:01:45,831
as far as you want,

4236
02:01:45,831 --> 02:01:48,500
where we were essentially
tribal monkey people,

4237
02:01:48,560 --> 02:01:48,770
right?

4238
02:01:48,770 --> 02:01:49,640
I mean that's,

4239
02:01:49,641 --> 02:01:54,641
that's all of those instincts that allowed
us to get to 2013 are all encoded in

4240
02:01:55,071 --> 02:01:55,850
our genome.

4241
02:01:55,850 --> 02:01:57,380
All of those instincts,

4242
02:01:57,381 --> 02:02:01,400
all of those reward systems are all
encoded and all of those words reward

4243
02:02:01,401 --> 02:02:01,920
systems.

4244
02:02:01,920 --> 02:02:06,920
Whether you look back to Napoleon or
Kingus Khan or you look at any war figure,

4245
02:02:07,791 --> 02:02:11,150
any dominator in throughout human history,

4246
02:02:11,690 --> 02:02:16,690
the people in power have always tried to
keep in power and suppress others what

4247
02:02:17,061 --> 02:02:18,110
they do and they do.

4248
02:02:18,150 --> 02:02:18,320
And,

4249
02:02:18,320 --> 02:02:23,320
but I think also if you look at the power
of technology to overwhelm everything,

4250
02:02:24,380 --> 02:02:26,660
including the head spook of the CIA,

4251
02:02:26,840 --> 02:02:28,880
I mean he was essentially
overwhelmed by email.

4252
02:02:28,970 --> 02:02:30,200
That's what took him over.

4253
02:02:30,410 --> 02:02:30,711
You know?

4254
02:02:30,711 --> 02:02:31,341
I mean it was,

4255
02:02:31,341 --> 02:02:33,290
it was the FBI looking into things,

4256
02:02:33,291 --> 02:02:36,140
but essentially it was all
done through electronic means.

4257
02:02:36,141 --> 02:02:37,160
It was all done through.

4258
02:02:37,280 --> 02:02:42,280
He was revealed by the very powers
that the CIA uses in the first place.

4259
02:02:42,591 --> 02:02:44,870
They're spies and the
national security agency.

4260
02:02:44,871 --> 02:02:47,270
You can bet on top spy was spied on.

4261
02:02:47,690 --> 02:02:49,760
It's in my opinion,

4262
02:02:49,761 --> 02:02:54,761
when I look at human history and I look
at where you just try to extrapolate,

4263
02:02:55,340 --> 02:02:57,380
when I try to extrapolate
where we're going,

4264
02:02:57,410 --> 02:03:01,550
it seems to me that it's all symbiotically
connected to technology and that

4265
02:03:01,551 --> 02:03:03,230
seems unavoidable.

4266
02:03:03,320 --> 02:03:07,100
That's why I have such a hard time with
the idea of someone creating some zero

4267
02:03:07,101 --> 02:03:08,060
point energy thing.

4268
02:03:08,061 --> 02:03:08,710
That's not,

4269
02:03:08,710 --> 02:03:10,250
that people don't,

4270
02:03:10,251 --> 02:03:14,390
aren't looking into enough people
know about what Tesla was working on.

4271
02:03:14,580 --> 02:03:19,580
Enough people are fascinated by the
ideas of wormholes and I just would think

4272
02:03:19,611 --> 02:03:23,210
that more people would be involved in
this and that the government with all it's

4273
02:03:23,211 --> 02:03:23,691
shady,

4274
02:03:23,691 --> 02:03:27,920
nefarious arms wouldn't be able
to put out all of those fires.

4275
02:03:28,010 --> 02:03:28,480
But a lot of it,

4276
02:03:28,480 --> 02:03:28,580
if it's

4277
02:03:28,580 --> 02:03:29,301
self censoring,

4278
02:03:29,301 --> 02:03:30,051
for example,

4279
02:03:30,051 --> 02:03:31,370
I'll give you a really good example.

4280
02:03:31,371 --> 02:03:33,170
There was an academic guy that uh,

4281
02:03:33,800 --> 02:03:34,490
uh,

4282
02:03:34,490 --> 02:03:38,600
I was talking to recently and he was
wanting to push into this issue and

4283
02:03:38,601 --> 02:03:39,620
basically he was told,

4284
02:03:39,621 --> 02:03:39,711
no,

4285
02:03:39,711 --> 02:03:44,210
you're not going to do it this university
because this is violating the second

4286
02:03:44,211 --> 02:03:45,680
law of thermodynamics and blah,

4287
02:03:45,681 --> 02:03:45,951
blah,

4288
02:03:45,951 --> 02:03:46,670
blah.

4289
02:03:46,670 --> 02:03:47,320
You know,

4290
02:03:47,320 --> 02:03:48,950
in a rational world,

4291
02:03:48,951 --> 02:03:50,300
which is what you're talking about,

4292
02:03:50,330 --> 02:03:51,290
I would agree with you.

4293
02:03:51,500 --> 02:03:53,330
But we don't live in a rational world.

4294
02:03:53,331 --> 02:03:57,440
We live in a world where there are a lot
of emotions and power hierarchies and

4295
02:03:57,441 --> 02:03:59,270
all kinds of dysfunctions.

4296
02:03:59,450 --> 02:04:02,570
And so you have to factor
that into the equation.

4297
02:04:02,900 --> 02:04:07,900
And I don't think you can underestimate
the reach of the national security

4298
02:04:07,911 --> 02:04:08,300
state,

4299
02:04:08,300 --> 02:04:08,901
not just here,

4300
02:04:08,901 --> 02:04:10,850
but around the world to,

4301
02:04:10,910 --> 02:04:11,510
uh,

4302
02:04:11,510 --> 02:04:12,680
put out these fires,

4303
02:04:12,681 --> 02:04:14,600
no matter how many times
they try to surface,

4304
02:04:14,810 --> 02:04:17,210
unless it's done in a very large way.

4305
02:04:17,210 --> 02:04:17,451
And I,

4306
02:04:17,451 --> 02:04:19,340
and I didn't believe that.

4307
02:04:19,440 --> 02:04:19,710
Uh,

4308
02:04:19,710 --> 02:04:24,710
and I've learned the hard way trying
to do it in a smaller fashion from this

4309
02:04:25,361 --> 02:04:25,610
sunlight.

4310
02:04:25,610 --> 02:04:26,750
The story I told you about this,

4311
02:04:26,820 --> 02:04:29,450
the scientist who works in a
skiff down near the Huntsville,

4312
02:04:29,480 --> 02:04:30,410
spaceflight center,

4313
02:04:30,920 --> 02:04:31,310
um,

4314
02:04:31,310 --> 02:04:32,960
Marshall space flight
center in Huntsville.

4315
02:04:32,961 --> 02:04:33,440
And,

4316
02:04:33,440 --> 02:04:38,440
and I think what we are going to have
to do is organize an effort that is very

4317
02:04:40,201 --> 02:04:44,790
much outside of government and mainstream
corporations and even academia because

4318
02:04:44,791 --> 02:04:45,630
academia,

4319
02:04:45,840 --> 02:04:46,820
if you have never been in it,

4320
02:04:46,850 --> 02:04:47,910
is so political.

4321
02:04:48,090 --> 02:04:48,923
I mean,

4322
02:04:49,110 --> 02:04:49,561
uh,

4323
02:04:49,561 --> 02:04:50,070
you know,

4324
02:04:50,070 --> 02:04:50,350
the,

4325
02:04:50,350 --> 02:04:50,510
the,

4326
02:04:50,510 --> 02:04:50,761
you know,

4327
02:04:50,761 --> 02:04:54,450
you touch the sorts of issues
and it's the end of your career.

4328
02:04:54,530 --> 02:04:54,750
I'll,

4329
02:04:54,750 --> 02:04:57,510
I'll give you a great story in
terms of other institutions.

4330
02:04:57,511 --> 02:04:57,721
You know,

4331
02:04:57,721 --> 02:05:02,010
the National Science Foundation is a
very big player in global warming studies

4332
02:05:02,011 --> 02:05:03,000
and all this kind of stuff.

4333
02:05:03,570 --> 02:05:08,570
And the deputy director of that and then
Dr Bob Correll and I had a long meeting

4334
02:05:08,851 --> 02:05:09,120
with,

4335
02:05:09,120 --> 02:05:13,110
with another person who was one of the
five directors of NASA back some years

4336
02:05:13,110 --> 02:05:13,710
ago.

4337
02:05:13,710 --> 02:05:13,981
And I,

4338
02:05:13,981 --> 02:05:14,461
and you know,

4339
02:05:14,461 --> 02:05:16,170
he was very interested in
exactly what we're talking about,

4340
02:05:16,171 --> 02:05:17,160
these sciences and studies.

4341
02:05:17,161 --> 02:05:17,581
And I said,

4342
02:05:17,581 --> 02:05:18,414
look,

4343
02:05:18,510 --> 02:05:21,120
we need some people at the
National Science Foundation,

4344
02:05:21,350 --> 02:05:21,750
uh,

4345
02:05:21,750 --> 02:05:21,991
to,

4346
02:05:21,991 --> 02:05:25,890
to really take this on as an
area of research and development,

4347
02:05:26,010 --> 02:05:26,590
funding,

4348
02:05:26,590 --> 02:05:27,423
et cetera.

4349
02:05:27,570 --> 02:05:28,403
He says,

4350
02:05:28,530 --> 02:05:31,590
it'd be the end of my
career if I did this.

4351
02:05:31,591 --> 02:05:31,831
I said,

4352
02:05:31,831 --> 02:05:32,310
well,

4353
02:05:32,310 --> 02:05:32,671
you know,

4354
02:05:32,671 --> 02:05:34,620
here is the future of
the earth or your career.

4355
02:05:34,621 --> 02:05:35,520
What are you going to choose?

4356
02:05:35,640 --> 02:05:37,650
Let's choose the earth and our future.

4357
02:05:37,920 --> 02:05:40,800
But the truth is everyone puts
their pants on one leg at a time.

4358
02:05:41,250 --> 02:05:44,610
And a lot of folks are not going to
jeopardize their careers and their income.

4359
02:05:44,640 --> 02:05:46,980
A very famous astronomer
who worked with Carl Sagan,

4360
02:05:47,370 --> 02:05:48,000
um,

4361
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:48,450
uh,

4362
02:05:48,450 --> 02:05:48,870
was,

4363
02:05:48,870 --> 02:05:49,051
uh,

4364
02:05:49,051 --> 02:05:51,750
at our meetings in 1997
that we did for Congress.

4365
02:05:51,751 --> 02:05:54,060
And after he did that with us,

4366
02:05:54,330 --> 02:05:56,670
he was told if he ever
wanted to be published again,

4367
02:05:56,671 --> 02:05:59,040
right again or have a career in astronomy,

4368
02:05:59,041 --> 02:06:00,780
he'd have to leave this issue alone.

4369
02:06:01,110 --> 02:06:04,790
So he was directly threatened
and he begged me to,

4370
02:06:04,860 --> 02:06:05,280
to,

4371
02:06:05,280 --> 02:06:05,431
you know,

4372
02:06:05,431 --> 02:06:06,510
keep going forward,

4373
02:06:06,570 --> 02:06:07,980
but that he couldn't be part of it.

4374
02:06:08,340 --> 02:06:09,210
And so I think that,

4375
02:06:09,211 --> 02:06:09,571
you know,

4376
02:06:09,571 --> 02:06:14,100
most people don't realize
that this happens every day
and it's kind of a miracle

4377
02:06:14,220 --> 02:06:14,671
that this,

4378
02:06:14,671 --> 02:06:19,671
this many military and
corporate intelligence people
came together this far.

4379
02:06:20,550 --> 02:06:23,370
But I won't even begin to tell you what
we've gone through trying to get this

4380
02:06:23,371 --> 02:06:23,551
far.

4381
02:06:23,551 --> 02:06:24,480
It's been very difficult.

4382
02:06:24,500 --> 02:06:24,770
And,

4383
02:06:24,770 --> 02:06:29,510
and so for every person you hear about
it and that you see in this film serious

4384
02:06:29,511 --> 02:06:29,691
or,

4385
02:06:29,691 --> 02:06:31,140
or in the disclosure project,

4386
02:06:31,770 --> 02:06:36,770
there are a hundred that wouldn't be
that I have given me the information and

4387
02:06:37,110 --> 02:06:38,790
even documents in intelligence,

4388
02:06:38,940 --> 02:06:40,590
but they don't want to
come out and be identified.

4389
02:06:40,591 --> 02:06:42,360
So there's a lot of fear of,

4390
02:06:42,361 --> 02:06:46,200
of either reprisals but also
just the ridicule factor.

4391
02:06:46,320 --> 02:06:46,501
You know,

4392
02:06:46,501 --> 02:06:50,940
I have a document from 1953 from the
CIA that talked about engaging Disney

4393
02:06:50,941 --> 02:06:55,941
studios to make of cartoonish movies
about this issue so that it would be the

4394
02:06:56,311 --> 02:06:56,970
butt of jokes.

4395
02:06:56,970 --> 02:06:57,081
And,

4396
02:06:57,081 --> 02:06:57,251
and,

4397
02:06:57,251 --> 02:06:57,431
and,

4398
02:06:57,431 --> 02:07:02,040
and this document talks
about the psychological
warfare value of the subject.

4399
02:07:02,280 --> 02:07:03,000
So,

4400
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:03,391
you know,

4401
02:07:03,391 --> 02:07:04,560
people are sort of like,

4402
02:07:04,561 --> 02:07:04,920
you know,

4403
02:07:04,920 --> 02:07:07,590
in middle school where you're worried
about what are people gonna think about me

4404
02:07:07,591 --> 02:07:08,011
if I say,

4405
02:07:08,011 --> 02:07:08,970
I think this is real,

4406
02:07:09,260 --> 02:07:12,000
are you going to lose credibility if
you're a doctor or a physicist or an

4407
02:07:12,001 --> 02:07:13,280
engineer or a politician?

4408
02:07:13,350 --> 02:07:17,360
Project Blue Book wasn't
that this predated this,

4409
02:07:17,490 --> 02:07:17,911
this,

4410
02:07:17,911 --> 02:07:21,480
this actually predated that when they
were first coming together with how do we

4411
02:07:21,481 --> 02:07:23,460
manage this because it's
hidden in plain sight.

4412
02:07:23,461 --> 02:07:24,780
People are going to see these objects.

4413
02:07:25,030 --> 02:07:25,440
Um,

4414
02:07:25,440 --> 02:07:27,760
there's no way to really sanitize it.

4415
02:07:27,980 --> 02:07:28,171
You know,

4416
02:07:28,171 --> 02:07:30,120
people think you can
really get rid of this.

4417
02:07:30,121 --> 02:07:30,211
Well,

4418
02:07:30,211 --> 02:07:30,541
you can,

4419
02:07:30,541 --> 02:07:33,540
if there's certain number of
people seeing this all the time,

4420
02:07:33,541 --> 02:07:34,410
we were highly credible.

4421
02:07:34,560 --> 02:07:35,393
So,

4422
02:07:35,470 --> 02:07:40,470
but if you create an environment where
it's ridiculous and you're considered a

4423
02:07:42,071 --> 02:07:43,450
kook or this or that,

4424
02:07:43,810 --> 02:07:44,081
uh,

4425
02:07:44,081 --> 02:07:46,060
if you are identified
with it or you'll be,

4426
02:07:46,061 --> 02:07:46,450
you know,

4427
02:07:46,450 --> 02:07:48,750
governor Moonbeam or senator,

4428
02:07:49,050 --> 02:07:50,800
a space cadet or something.

4429
02:07:51,190 --> 02:07:51,790
Um,

4430
02:07:51,790 --> 02:07:56,680
and this is one of the real problems is
that the subject has been so ridiculed

4431
02:07:56,681 --> 02:08:00,400
and there's so much ridiculous stuff
out there on the subject that's provably

4432
02:08:00,401 --> 02:08:01,330
nonsensical,

4433
02:08:01,560 --> 02:08:02,380
um,

4434
02:08:02,380 --> 02:08:05,350
that credible people really
have to swallow hard.

4435
02:08:05,351 --> 02:08:06,184
I have to tell you,

4436
02:08:06,280 --> 02:08:10,630
the scientists that are at this Major
Ivy League university doing the work on

4437
02:08:10,631 --> 02:08:12,070
this little body,

4438
02:08:12,071 --> 02:08:13,660
this humanoid type body,

4439
02:08:14,230 --> 02:08:14,890
um,

4440
02:08:14,890 --> 02:08:15,723
you know,

4441
02:08:16,030 --> 02:08:16,630
big,

4442
02:08:16,630 --> 02:08:18,430
big thing for them to be working on this.

4443
02:08:18,760 --> 02:08:19,593
Um,

4444
02:08:19,900 --> 02:08:23,290
and it's even a bigger thing that they're
going to go on the record about their

4445
02:08:23,291 --> 02:08:24,124
findings.

4446
02:08:24,230 --> 02:08:27,200
When are they going to
do this in the next,

4447
02:08:27,420 --> 02:08:27,670
well,

4448
02:08:27,670 --> 02:08:29,740
you'll see on April 22nd
comes to the premiere.

4449
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:30,870
I'll come to the premiere,

4450
02:08:30,871 --> 02:08:34,880
but on April 22nd what if no
one has made some sort of a,

4451
02:08:34,881 --> 02:08:35,820
a public statement?

4452
02:08:35,821 --> 02:08:36,150
No.

4453
02:08:36,150 --> 02:08:37,230
Ivy League scientists,

4454
02:08:37,520 --> 02:08:38,130
they're going to,

4455
02:08:38,130 --> 02:08:38,641
so yes,

4456
02:08:38,641 --> 02:08:40,710
you're promising between
now and April 22nd,

4457
02:08:40,711 --> 02:08:42,180
there'll be some sort of a reveal.

4458
02:08:42,230 --> 02:08:42,361
We'll,

4459
02:08:42,361 --> 02:08:42,900
we'll have some,

4460
02:08:42,900 --> 02:08:43,681
these releases,

4461
02:08:43,681 --> 02:08:48,681
major institution scientists of credible
history will step forward and say,

4462
02:08:50,190 --> 02:08:50,461
hey,

4463
02:08:50,461 --> 02:08:51,001
this is,

4464
02:08:51,001 --> 02:08:53,190
this is something we don't
know what they're going to say.

4465
02:08:53,191 --> 02:08:54,900
They're still doing the run on the genome.

4466
02:08:54,930 --> 02:08:55,051
Well,

4467
02:08:55,051 --> 02:08:55,831
he's extraordinary.

4468
02:08:55,831 --> 02:08:56,610
If it's real,

4469
02:08:56,610 --> 02:08:56,931
if it's,

4470
02:08:56,931 --> 02:08:57,300
it's a,

4471
02:08:57,300 --> 02:08:57,841
if it is,

4472
02:08:57,841 --> 02:08:58,171
okay,

4473
02:08:58,171 --> 02:08:59,440
let me put that to rest right now.

4474
02:08:59,550 --> 02:09:00,250
You touched it.

4475
02:09:00,250 --> 02:09:01,083
Yeah,

4476
02:09:01,690 --> 02:09:02,523
I've touched it.

4477
02:09:02,530 --> 02:09:03,670
We have the cat scans.

4478
02:09:03,700 --> 02:09:05,680
We have the reports from
these top scientists.

4479
02:09:05,681 --> 02:09:08,140
The only thing left that we're
doing is running the genome,

4480
02:09:08,500 --> 02:09:09,640
which is the whole genome.

4481
02:09:09,790 --> 02:09:13,780
So that scientists have said that it's
absolutely a biological origin that is

4482
02:09:13,781 --> 02:09:14,110
not,

4483
02:09:14,110 --> 02:09:15,430
it's not like my werewolf.

4484
02:09:15,610 --> 02:09:16,200
No,

4485
02:09:16,200 --> 02:09:16,500
no.

4486
02:09:16,500 --> 02:09:17,000
Robert,

4487
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:17,230
this,

4488
02:09:17,230 --> 02:09:17,951
we know this,

4489
02:09:17,951 --> 02:09:20,980
we absolutely know and put that to rest.

4490
02:09:21,340 --> 02:09:24,250
Has this damaged your credibility in life?

4491
02:09:24,251 --> 02:09:24,461
I mean,

4492
02:09:24,461 --> 02:09:24,821
have you,

4493
02:09:24,821 --> 02:09:27,040
have you suffered because
of this in any way,

4494
02:09:27,041 --> 02:09:27,874
shape or form?

4495
02:09:28,020 --> 02:09:28,421
Of course.

4496
02:09:28,421 --> 02:09:29,150
In what way?

4497
02:09:29,150 --> 02:09:29,983
Every way.

4498
02:09:30,020 --> 02:09:30,853
Yeah.

4499
02:09:31,010 --> 02:09:31,250
Yeah.

4500
02:09:31,250 --> 02:09:32,120
It's been the hardest thing.

4501
02:09:32,121 --> 02:09:32,301
You know,

4502
02:09:32,301 --> 02:09:35,430
I tell people the worst days
in the Er or you know how old,

4503
02:09:35,431 --> 02:09:36,920
a three year old that died in my arms.

4504
02:09:36,921 --> 02:09:37,754
This has been harder.

4505
02:09:38,390 --> 02:09:39,050
So,

4506
02:09:39,050 --> 02:09:39,590
you know,

4507
02:09:39,590 --> 02:09:41,300
it's harder than a death of a little baby.

4508
02:09:41,301 --> 02:09:41,750
Really.

4509
02:09:41,750 --> 02:09:42,430
Yeah.

4510
02:09:42,430 --> 02:09:43,610
The stuff we've had to deal with,

4511
02:09:44,150 --> 02:09:44,983
like in what way?

4512
02:09:45,380 --> 02:09:47,330
Horrible stuff I don't
really won't go into,

4513
02:09:47,331 --> 02:09:47,571
I mean,

4514
02:09:47,571 --> 02:09:48,440
we probably don't have time,

4515
02:09:48,441 --> 02:09:49,160
but,

4516
02:09:49,160 --> 02:09:49,730
um,

4517
02:09:49,730 --> 02:09:54,470
every nasty thing that can be done
has been done or attempted to be done.

4518
02:09:55,700 --> 02:09:59,780
Too many of us and particularly to to us,

4519
02:09:59,810 --> 02:10:00,080
uh,

4520
02:10:00,080 --> 02:10:00,290
my,

4521
02:10:00,290 --> 02:10:01,160
my family and

4522
02:10:02,720 --> 02:10:03,750
my family so much is,

4523
02:10:03,760 --> 02:10:04,400
is,

4524
02:10:04,400 --> 02:10:04,730
you know,

4525
02:10:04,730 --> 02:10:06,860
targeting me with

4526
02:10:07,440 --> 02:10:11,400
nastiness of it was just unbelievable
and ridicule and always know that.

4527
02:10:12,640 --> 02:10:13,473
Yeah.

4528
02:10:13,530 --> 02:10:14,640
People threaten you to what?

4529
02:10:14,641 --> 02:10:16,140
Stop talking about Ufos.

4530
02:10:16,520 --> 02:10:17,150
Um,

4531
02:10:17,150 --> 02:10:17,983
you know,

4532
02:10:18,510 --> 02:10:19,800
problems that we've had with them.

4533
02:10:19,820 --> 02:10:20,990
A lot of security problems.

4534
02:10:20,991 --> 02:10:24,860
I mean there was an FBI file over open
on this because of the death threats and

4535
02:10:24,861 --> 02:10:26,030
this stuff we've had.

4536
02:10:26,900 --> 02:10:27,733
And so you,

4537
02:10:27,820 --> 02:10:30,810
these death threats are from these people
that you're exposing that are in the

4538
02:10:30,830 --> 02:10:31,940
cabal of this.

4539
02:10:32,490 --> 02:10:33,770
Who knows where coming from.

4540
02:10:33,771 --> 02:10:34,010
You could

4541
02:10:34,010 --> 02:10:35,390
just say it with some nut job,

4542
02:10:35,550 --> 02:10:36,960
like the people who shot up the,

4543
02:10:37,160 --> 02:10:38,270
the Sikh temple,

4544
02:10:38,271 --> 02:10:40,250
where are our directors
family as you know,

4545
02:10:40,610 --> 02:10:43,730
his father was murdered
horribly at this thing.

4546
02:10:43,731 --> 02:10:44,450
And uh,

4547
02:10:44,450 --> 02:10:45,231
but you know,

4548
02:10:45,231 --> 02:10:49,610
I'm just saying that it's a lot easier
being an emergency doctor than dealing

4549
02:10:49,611 --> 02:10:52,640
with this issue when you know it's real
and you're dealing with this level of

4550
02:10:52,641 --> 02:10:57,641
intelligence in the CIA
has affected your career.

4551
02:10:58,370 --> 02:10:58,551
Yeah,

4552
02:10:58,551 --> 02:11:00,170
I've left medicine not cause I had to,

4553
02:11:00,200 --> 02:11:00,501
no,

4554
02:11:00,501 --> 02:11:01,030
I mean,

4555
02:11:01,030 --> 02:11:04,580
but because I had to
choose how I put this.

4556
02:11:05,120 --> 02:11:07,070
You only have 24 hours in a day.

4557
02:11:07,490 --> 02:11:08,323
And you know,

4558
02:11:08,540 --> 02:11:13,540
at a certain point I had to decide I'm
either going to continue as a physician

4559
02:11:15,050 --> 02:11:17,420
or I'm going to go full steam on this.

4560
02:11:17,960 --> 02:11:21,680
Now of course it was a big sacrifice for
my family and I was given up hundreds

4561
02:11:21,680 --> 02:11:23,690
of thousands of dollars a year as
a doctor to do this for nothing.

4562
02:11:24,110 --> 02:11:24,943
All right.

4563
02:11:24,980 --> 02:11:25,640
So,

4564
02:11:25,640 --> 02:11:26,120
um,

4565
02:11:26,120 --> 02:11:27,050
it's been difficult.

4566
02:11:27,140 --> 02:11:27,581
So I just,

4567
02:11:27,581 --> 02:11:27,891
what I'm saying,

4568
02:11:27,891 --> 02:11:29,120
it's been difficult in every way,

4569
02:11:29,330 --> 02:11:29,810
but that,

4570
02:11:29,810 --> 02:11:30,471
that's not important.

4571
02:11:30,471 --> 02:11:31,060
I'm not sure.

4572
02:11:31,060 --> 02:11:31,893
Well,

4573
02:11:32,080 --> 02:11:33,640
it is important and you're,

4574
02:11:33,670 --> 02:11:34,310
you,

4575
02:11:34,310 --> 02:11:34,750
that's a,

4576
02:11:34,750 --> 02:11:35,960
it's a tremendous sacrifice.

4577
02:11:36,200 --> 02:11:36,431
Um,

4578
02:11:36,431 --> 02:11:38,810
especially cause it's something
that you would truly believe in.

4579
02:11:38,960 --> 02:11:40,130
How do you support yourself now?

4580
02:11:41,340 --> 02:11:42,030
Well,

4581
02:11:42,030 --> 02:11:42,863
um,

4582
02:11:43,590 --> 02:11:45,750
I have enough resourcefulness.

4583
02:11:45,751 --> 02:11:45,930
I,

4584
02:11:45,930 --> 02:11:45,991
I,

4585
02:11:45,991 --> 02:11:46,980
before I left medicine,

4586
02:11:46,981 --> 02:11:51,981
I bought my home and I'd saved enough
and invest enough that I'm okay.

4587
02:11:53,050 --> 02:11:53,361
Um,

4588
02:11:53,361 --> 02:11:56,610
and then I have a little bit of income
from some of the books and things,

4589
02:11:56,611 --> 02:11:57,241
but I mean,

4590
02:11:57,241 --> 02:11:58,590
it's very modest compared to,

4591
02:11:58,620 --> 02:11:58,831
you know,

4592
02:11:58,831 --> 02:11:59,730
what I would have been making.

4593
02:11:59,731 --> 02:12:00,070
I,

4594
02:12:00,070 --> 02:12:00,240
I,

4595
02:12:00,240 --> 02:12:00,571
you know,

4596
02:12:00,571 --> 02:12:00,840
I,

4597
02:12:00,840 --> 02:12:02,400
I'd probably in the aggregate of,

4598
02:12:02,401 --> 02:12:07,401
given up around somewhere
in the neighborhood of five
to $6 million in income

4599
02:12:07,530 --> 02:12:08,363
doing this,

4600
02:12:08,540 --> 02:12:09,000
um,

4601
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:12,390
w which I actually don't regret at all
because I don't care about the money.

4602
02:12:12,780 --> 02:12:13,410
Um,

4603
02:12:13,410 --> 02:12:13,611
I,

4604
02:12:13,611 --> 02:12:16,080
I care about people say that
I hate when people say that.

4605
02:12:16,110 --> 02:12:16,201
No,

4606
02:12:16,201 --> 02:12:16,891
I really don't.

4607
02:12:16,891 --> 02:12:17,101
I mean,

4608
02:12:17,101 --> 02:12:17,671
this is why,

4609
02:12:17,671 --> 02:12:18,330
you know,

4610
02:12:18,330 --> 02:12:21,120
and now this the deal probably
string credulity here,

4611
02:12:21,121 --> 02:12:26,121
but a former head of army intelligence
approached me in 1992 and,

4612
02:12:26,490 --> 02:12:26,571
uh,

4613
02:12:26,571 --> 02:12:27,404
offered me,

4614
02:12:27,630 --> 02:12:28,440
um,

4615
02:12:28,440 --> 02:12:32,310
the kind of control
over a $2 billion fund.

4616
02:12:32,880 --> 02:12:36,630
If I would shut up and close down
the disclosure project and see Seti,

4617
02:12:36,890 --> 02:12:36,981
uh,

4618
02:12:36,981 --> 02:12:40,190
could not control over a
$2 billion fund with a,

4619
02:12:40,191 --> 02:12:40,600
B,

4620
02:12:40,600 --> 02:12:40,930
two g.

4621
02:12:40,930 --> 02:12:41,763
And what,

4622
02:12:42,200 --> 02:12:42,950
what did he want you to do?

4623
02:12:42,950 --> 02:12:43,783
Just basically,

4624
02:12:43,920 --> 02:12:45,050
I could do anything with it.

4625
02:12:45,170 --> 02:12:46,210
So long as I of shut,

4626
02:12:47,090 --> 02:12:50,630
you could just go big
pimpin giant yacht Ferrari,

4627
02:12:50,810 --> 02:12:51,291
who knows.

4628
02:12:51,291 --> 02:12:51,560
No,

4629
02:12:51,560 --> 02:12:52,640
no more Dr. Greer

4630
02:12:52,710 --> 02:12:53,011
and then,

4631
02:12:53,011 --> 02:12:53,221
you know,

4632
02:12:53,221 --> 02:12:53,641
and I said,

4633
02:12:53,641 --> 02:12:53,791
no,

4634
02:12:53,791 --> 02:12:57,330
I'm not going to do that because I really
believe that this issue needs to be

4635
02:12:57,331 --> 02:12:58,680
dealt with it properly.

4636
02:12:58,810 --> 02:13:02,130
The Guy who went to my wife and
tried to convince her to convince me,

4637
02:13:02,340 --> 02:13:03,090
and this,

4638
02:13:03,090 --> 02:13:03,301
you know,

4639
02:13:03,301 --> 02:13:04,134
this is the kind of thing,

4640
02:13:04,460 --> 02:13:06,840
does he want you to work for him or
he just wanted you to share them?

4641
02:13:07,060 --> 02:13:10,750
He wanted me to merge what we were
doing with some operation he had,

4642
02:13:10,751 --> 02:13:13,400
which would have
basically subsumed it and,

4643
02:13:13,500 --> 02:13:14,690
and cooperative and,

4644
02:13:14,691 --> 02:13:15,191
and I said,

4645
02:13:15,191 --> 02:13:15,820
no.

4646
02:13:15,820 --> 02:13:18,760
And then he made another
run and I said no.

4647
02:13:19,090 --> 02:13:20,650
And then about a month after that,

4648
02:13:20,651 --> 02:13:21,520
all over the Internet,

4649
02:13:21,521 --> 02:13:22,930
it came out that I wasn't even a doctor.

4650
02:13:22,931 --> 02:13:26,770
Here I am in this emergency department
and it's a bunch of goons and put out

4651
02:13:26,771 --> 02:13:29,860
there that I'm not even an
actual MD and I'm there,

4652
02:13:29,861 --> 02:13:30,071
you know,

4653
02:13:30,071 --> 02:13:33,960
up to my eyeballs in blood and guts
and in the Er and this thing breaks.

4654
02:13:33,961 --> 02:13:34,320
So,

4655
02:13:34,320 --> 02:13:34,510
you know,

4656
02:13:34,510 --> 02:13:39,210
they do all kinds of disinformation in
psychological warfare stuff on people.

4657
02:13:39,530 --> 02:13:40,140
Um,

4658
02:13:40,140 --> 02:13:43,020
but I don't really mind
that that's happened.

4659
02:13:43,380 --> 02:13:43,591
Uh,

4660
02:13:43,591 --> 02:13:47,520
what I'm more concerned about is the
people who have the knowledge and

4661
02:13:47,521 --> 02:13:48,540
responsibility,

4662
02:13:48,750 --> 02:13:53,010
who don't do the right thing because
there's no way that I can do this by

4663
02:13:53,011 --> 02:13:53,560
myself.

4664
02:13:53,560 --> 02:13:55,830
And what I was really gratified to see,

4665
02:13:55,831 --> 02:13:58,020
and I'm still gratified to see is,

4666
02:13:58,790 --> 02:13:59,140
you know,

4667
02:13:59,140 --> 02:14:00,270
are all these people,

4668
02:14:00,480 --> 02:14:04,620
the military men and women and others who
have come forward a very courageously,

4669
02:14:04,700 --> 02:14:05,400
um,

4670
02:14:05,400 --> 02:14:09,300
academics like the ones doing the
work on this potential little humanoid

4671
02:14:09,750 --> 02:14:10,171
creature,

4672
02:14:10,171 --> 02:14:11,280
which is a real creature,

4673
02:14:11,281 --> 02:14:11,760
whether it,

4674
02:14:11,760 --> 02:14:12,241
what it is,

4675
02:14:12,241 --> 02:14:13,074
we don't know,

4676
02:14:13,110 --> 02:14:14,070
but they,

4677
02:14:14,071 --> 02:14:16,590
it's a really courageous thing
for these people to be doing that.

4678
02:14:16,890 --> 02:14:17,723
Um,

4679
02:14:17,830 --> 02:14:22,020
the people who led the charge and
France to release all these documents.

4680
02:14:22,340 --> 02:14:22,610
Um,

4681
02:14:22,610 --> 02:14:23,820
I know the backstory to that,

4682
02:14:23,821 --> 02:14:24,930
that the public doesn't know.

4683
02:14:25,290 --> 02:14:26,010
Um,

4684
02:14:26,010 --> 02:14:26,700
and there were,

4685
02:14:26,700 --> 02:14:27,930
it was very controversial.

4686
02:14:28,290 --> 02:14:29,150
So I mean,

4687
02:14:29,520 --> 02:14:31,440
this is the kind of courage we need,

4688
02:14:31,770 --> 02:14:32,010
uh,

4689
02:14:32,010 --> 02:14:35,040
to get the truth out and to
go forward as a civilization.

4690
02:14:35,340 --> 02:14:35,880
And,

4691
02:14:35,880 --> 02:14:36,420
um,

4692
02:14:36,420 --> 02:14:36,751
so,

4693
02:14:36,751 --> 02:14:36,961
you know,

4694
02:14:36,961 --> 02:14:37,794
you can't buy it.

4695
02:14:37,920 --> 02:14:38,610
You got to have it.

4696
02:14:38,610 --> 02:14:39,450
You got to manifest it.

4697
02:14:39,490 --> 02:14:40,200
Him.

4698
02:14:40,200 --> 02:14:42,270
Are you getting income from this?

4699
02:14:42,320 --> 02:14:43,050
Hm.

4700
02:14:43,050 --> 02:14:43,560
No.

4701
02:14:43,560 --> 02:14:44,820
You don't get any income from them?

4702
02:14:44,860 --> 02:14:45,070
No.

4703
02:14:45,070 --> 02:14:45,940
This is um,

4704
02:14:46,150 --> 02:14:46,361
you know,

4705
02:14:46,361 --> 02:14:48,240
and you know what's
beautiful about serious it,

4706
02:14:48,270 --> 02:14:51,010
the movie is that it was all crowdfunded.

4707
02:14:52,030 --> 02:14:52,480
No,

4708
02:14:52,480 --> 02:14:54,300
no one on my team has
taken any funds from,

4709
02:14:54,320 --> 02:14:56,050
it's all going into the
production of the movie.

4710
02:14:56,120 --> 02:14:57,230
You don't even take a salary?

4711
02:14:57,620 --> 02:14:58,010
No.

4712
02:14:58,010 --> 02:14:58,760
Oh No,

4713
02:14:58,760 --> 02:14:58,930
no.

4714
02:14:58,930 --> 02:14:59,790
It's all gone into,

4715
02:14:59,900 --> 02:15:00,710
into the film.

4716
02:15:00,710 --> 02:15:03,760
But you list expenses like
I don't you list like a,

4717
02:15:03,770 --> 02:15:04,670
the several hundred,

4718
02:15:04,910 --> 02:15:09,620
$270,000 or something and expenses
that you charge to create this,

4719
02:15:09,621 --> 02:15:09,801
uh,

4720
02:15:09,801 --> 02:15:10,634
this film.

4721
02:15:11,020 --> 02:15:11,241
Well,

4722
02:15:11,241 --> 02:15:11,660
yeah,

4723
02:15:11,660 --> 02:15:12,890
that's the production company.

4724
02:15:12,891 --> 02:15:13,161
You know,

4725
02:15:13,161 --> 02:15:14,420
cause I'm not a filmmaker,

4726
02:15:14,680 --> 02:15:15,410
right.

4727
02:15:15,410 --> 02:15:16,720
Don't ask me to turn on campus.

4728
02:15:16,721 --> 02:15:19,010
So we have people to
this production company

4729
02:15:19,660 --> 02:15:20,800
and then of course we're going to,

4730
02:15:20,860 --> 02:15:21,220
uh,

4731
02:15:21,220 --> 02:15:21,421
you know,

4732
02:15:21,421 --> 02:15:23,830
he had to organize the premiere
and of course being crowd funded,

4733
02:15:24,160 --> 02:15:26,680
you have to fulfill all the
incentives for the crowd funding.

4734
02:15:26,681 --> 02:15:27,670
I don't know if you know crowd funding,

4735
02:15:27,840 --> 02:15:30,340
but I want to thank everyone
who's listening by the way.

4736
02:15:32,070 --> 02:15:35,020
We did a Kickstarter and then our
own private program and you know,

4737
02:15:35,021 --> 02:15:38,770
we have like 4,000 people who
have contributed funds to this,

4738
02:15:38,771 --> 02:15:40,570
which is really a huge number of folks.

4739
02:15:40,571 --> 02:15:41,404
And um,

4740
02:15:41,590 --> 02:15:42,041
and by the way,

4741
02:15:42,041 --> 02:15:43,360
all of you folks who've done that,

4742
02:15:43,361 --> 02:15:43,810
the uh,

4743
02:15:43,810 --> 02:15:44,261
I just want to,

4744
02:15:44,261 --> 02:15:48,790
can I say this to the premier is going
to be here in Los Angeles on Earth Day,

4745
02:15:48,791 --> 02:15:50,740
April 22nd at the,

4746
02:15:50,770 --> 02:15:51,603
um,

4747
02:15:51,620 --> 02:15:51,790
uh,

4748
02:15:51,790 --> 02:15:52,600
la live,

4749
02:15:52,600 --> 02:15:53,680
the Ricoh la live,

4750
02:15:53,760 --> 02:15:54,200
uh,

4751
02:15:54,200 --> 02:15:55,240
cinemas downtown,

4752
02:15:55,540 --> 02:15:56,470
the premier theater.

4753
02:15:56,860 --> 02:15:57,760
And um,

4754
02:15:57,761 --> 02:15:58,840
so that's April 22nd.

4755
02:15:58,841 --> 02:15:59,501
If you want to come,

4756
02:15:59,501 --> 02:16:02,300
you can kind of sign up and get
tickets at serious disclosure,

4757
02:16:02,510 --> 02:16:02,841
calm.

4758
02:16:02,841 --> 02:16:04,550
I'm writing that in my calendar right now.

4759
02:16:04,551 --> 02:16:05,450
I'm going to try to make that,

4760
02:16:05,460 --> 02:16:06,800
that sounds really fascinating.

4761
02:16:06,801 --> 02:16:07,634
I can't tweet us.

4762
02:16:07,760 --> 02:16:08,810
And you're invited to come,

4763
02:16:09,200 --> 02:16:10,220
come as my guest.

4764
02:16:12,080 --> 02:16:12,230
Love

4765
02:16:12,230 --> 02:16:13,070
to have you as my guest.

4766
02:16:13,071 --> 02:16:13,461
If you want.

4767
02:16:13,461 --> 02:16:14,220
I would love to go.

4768
02:16:14,220 --> 02:16:16,970
We're going to have a red carpet and
we're going to invite some other,

4769
02:16:16,971 --> 02:16:17,720
um,

4770
02:16:17,720 --> 02:16:17,961
you know,

4771
02:16:17,961 --> 02:16:20,430
people here in Hollywood
and in the business and um,

4772
02:16:20,810 --> 02:16:22,040
it's going to be an exciting event.

4773
02:16:22,041 --> 02:16:25,880
I mean the theater only holds 809 people
of which about half of those seats are

4774
02:16:25,881 --> 02:16:26,810
already spoken for.

4775
02:16:27,110 --> 02:16:28,160
But um,

4776
02:16:28,190 --> 02:16:28,791
but you know,

4777
02:16:28,791 --> 02:16:29,910
those of you want to come,

4778
02:16:29,970 --> 02:16:30,120
you

4779
02:16:30,120 --> 02:16:30,221
know,

4780
02:16:30,221 --> 02:16:32,700
just hop online and you know,

4781
02:16:32,701 --> 02:16:34,710
the system is set up so you
can do it all digitally.

4782
02:16:34,770 --> 02:16:35,160
You know,

4783
02:16:35,160 --> 02:16:36,750
it's not going to be
tickets at the door though.

4784
02:16:36,840 --> 02:16:37,673
Okay.

4785
02:16:37,690 --> 02:16:38,410
Um,

4786
02:16:38,410 --> 02:16:43,000
what is this thing that you're doing
where you leave people out into the desert

4787
02:16:43,090 --> 02:16:48,090
and you have them make contact with
something if Uriel crafts and beings and

4788
02:16:50,620 --> 02:16:50,891
what,

4789
02:16:50,891 --> 02:16:51,161
what,

4790
02:16:51,161 --> 02:16:51,994
what is that?

4791
02:16:52,400 --> 02:16:52,611
Well,

4792
02:16:52,611 --> 02:16:54,190
that's the whole [inaudible] concept.

4793
02:16:54,200 --> 02:16:56,810
I was talking about close encounters of
the fifth kind that we're using these

4794
02:16:56,811 --> 02:16:57,531
different protocols.

4795
02:16:57,531 --> 02:16:57,921
And by the way,

4796
02:16:57,921 --> 02:16:58,460
there's a,

4797
02:16:58,460 --> 02:16:59,300
there's a smartphone,

4798
02:16:59,301 --> 02:17:02,360
an iPhone app for this that you
can get it serious disclosure.com.

4799
02:17:02,361 --> 02:17:03,470
So that has all the,

4800
02:17:03,810 --> 02:17:07,190
it'll actually turn your phone
into a magnet magnetometer.

4801
02:17:07,340 --> 02:17:11,210
It has the tones that were recorded in
this crop circle of this weird energy

4802
02:17:11,211 --> 02:17:13,610
that came into the crops
on my phone right now.

4803
02:17:13,640 --> 02:17:13,851
Yes.

4804
02:17:13,851 --> 02:17:14,900
You can get them what it called.

4805
02:17:15,140 --> 02:17:16,670
It's called the contact app,

4806
02:17:17,170 --> 02:17:18,250
I'll and it,

4807
02:17:18,590 --> 02:17:19,190
and it's at,

4808
02:17:19,190 --> 02:17:20,023
it's at a,

4809
02:17:20,300 --> 02:17:23,320
you can go to serious
disclosure.com and there's a,

4810
02:17:23,540 --> 02:17:23,710
uh,

4811
02:17:23,710 --> 02:17:28,710
an icon there and you can link and it
goes to the either the iTunes store or the

4812
02:17:29,481 --> 02:17:30,470
android store.

4813
02:17:30,560 --> 02:17:30,950
Okay.

4814
02:17:30,950 --> 02:17:31,311
And,

4815
02:17:31,311 --> 02:17:31,640
um,

4816
02:17:31,640 --> 02:17:32,950
what happens when you take these feed,

4817
02:17:32,980 --> 02:17:34,310
you'll take anyone out there.

4818
02:17:34,311 --> 02:17:36,500
Did they have to go through
a screening process?

4819
02:17:36,520 --> 02:17:37,180
Like there's an APP.

4820
02:17:37,180 --> 02:17:38,360
I mean it's of course it's a,

4821
02:17:38,361 --> 02:17:43,361
if we do about a week training of people
in remote viewing and the protocols of

4822
02:17:43,881 --> 02:17:45,620
contact and uh,

4823
02:17:45,760 --> 02:17:47,870
they're sort of the whole concept of it,

4824
02:17:47,990 --> 02:17:50,240
but also how to look at the night sky.

4825
02:17:50,390 --> 02:17:51,560
You go out with satellite charts.

4826
02:17:51,561 --> 02:17:53,480
We have fourth generation night scopes.

4827
02:17:53,720 --> 02:17:55,040
We have really good cameras.

4828
02:17:55,070 --> 02:17:55,903
Um,

4829
02:17:55,970 --> 02:17:57,170
and you know,

4830
02:17:57,650 --> 02:17:59,930
in fact we're going to be
doing one in Colorado in June.

4831
02:18:00,290 --> 02:18:01,520
I'm in the high desert.

4832
02:18:01,580 --> 02:18:02,690
I have some land up there.

4833
02:18:02,720 --> 02:18:03,110
Um,

4834
02:18:03,110 --> 02:18:04,970
what is the actual name of this app?

4835
02:18:04,971 --> 02:18:06,800
Because there was a
couple of contact apps.

4836
02:18:07,220 --> 02:18:07,941
Well again,

4837
02:18:07,941 --> 02:18:11,030
you have to go to serious disclosure.com
and there's a link there for it.

4838
02:18:11,420 --> 02:18:11,561
I,

4839
02:18:11,561 --> 02:18:13,970
you know the name of the
name of your own app.

4840
02:18:14,800 --> 02:18:15,633
You know,

4841
02:18:16,070 --> 02:18:17,510
I have so many irons in the fire.

4842
02:18:17,511 --> 02:18:21,810
I think it's called a the t contact at
o t contact that I'm gonna try that t

4843
02:18:21,860 --> 02:18:22,693
contract up.

4844
02:18:22,880 --> 02:18:23,350
So,

4845
02:18:23,350 --> 02:18:24,470
and explain to me what,

4846
02:18:24,920 --> 02:18:25,701
what happens here.

4847
02:18:25,701 --> 02:18:29,090
You have a course and in this
course what are these people do?

4848
02:18:30,020 --> 02:18:30,960
The idea is,

4849
02:18:30,961 --> 02:18:34,130
is that we want to see your signal.

4850
02:18:34,560 --> 02:18:34,960
That is,

4851
02:18:34,960 --> 02:18:35,793
that is.

4852
02:18:36,410 --> 02:18:38,960
So I just bought your APP.

4853
02:18:39,020 --> 02:18:39,853
Powerful.

4854
02:18:40,340 --> 02:18:40,641
Okay.

4855
02:18:40,641 --> 02:18:44,540
So explain to me where would someone
sign up for something like this?

4856
02:18:45,020 --> 02:18:45,291
Yeah.

4857
02:18:45,291 --> 02:18:47,870
And we do these expeditions
a few times a year.

4858
02:18:48,150 --> 02:18:48,983
Um,

4859
02:18:49,040 --> 02:18:49,873
I used to,

4860
02:18:50,420 --> 02:18:53,030
there there are only
about 20 people who are,

4861
02:18:53,150 --> 02:18:54,470
who are allowed to come now,

4862
02:18:54,820 --> 02:18:55,070
um,

4863
02:18:55,070 --> 02:18:55,903
when you had a time,

4864
02:18:56,300 --> 02:18:59,510
cause I can't handle more than that for
a week out in the desert or out in the

4865
02:18:59,511 --> 02:18:59,930
mountains,

4866
02:18:59,930 --> 02:19:01,130
but um,

4867
02:19:01,340 --> 02:19:04,460
and I just don't have time to do it
more often than the four or five times a

4868
02:19:04,461 --> 02:19:05,530
year that we do.

4869
02:19:05,610 --> 02:19:07,750
So you do it quarterly you,

4870
02:19:07,760 --> 02:19:08,390
um,

4871
02:19:08,390 --> 02:19:09,280
well yeah,

4872
02:19:09,290 --> 02:19:09,861
the seasonally,

4873
02:19:09,861 --> 02:19:12,170
but the schedule is
up@cirrusdisclosure.com.

4874
02:19:12,171 --> 02:19:13,970
There's a place where do
you bring these people?

4875
02:19:14,480 --> 02:19:15,051
It just depends.

4876
02:19:15,051 --> 02:19:15,770
I mean like we're at,

4877
02:19:15,770 --> 02:19:17,810
the next one is going to be in
the high desert of Colorado.

4878
02:19:17,920 --> 02:19:19,340
I'm at about 8,000 feet.

4879
02:19:19,690 --> 02:19:22,880
It was a remote area near the great sand
dunes that's had a lot of reports of

4880
02:19:22,881 --> 02:19:24,110
Ufos and contact.

4881
02:19:24,111 --> 02:19:24,501
In fact,

4882
02:19:24,501 --> 02:19:24,800
uh,

4883
02:19:24,800 --> 02:19:27,920
the film director and his crew were
out there last a few months ago

4884
02:19:28,180 --> 02:19:32,770
in 2012 when we had this disc fly over
and then a jet came into intercepted and

4885
02:19:32,790 --> 02:19:33,410
just,

4886
02:19:33,410 --> 02:19:34,400
and that's going to be in the film.

4887
02:19:34,401 --> 02:19:38,420
It's really cool video of that
or a photo that both really,

4888
02:19:38,540 --> 02:19:42,410
so you have a video of this disk in
the sky and then a jet approaching a

4889
02:19:42,411 --> 02:19:44,600
discount probably coming
out of Colorado Springs.

4890
02:19:44,601 --> 02:19:45,770
So that was coming out of that direction.

4891
02:19:45,771 --> 02:19:46,131
But yeah,

4892
02:19:46,131 --> 02:19:46,341
it was,

4893
02:19:46,341 --> 02:19:46,790
it's,

4894
02:19:46,790 --> 02:19:47,780
it's really pretty cool.

4895
02:19:47,781 --> 02:19:48,200
And of course,

4896
02:19:48,200 --> 02:19:48,731
I think when,

4897
02:19:48,731 --> 02:19:49,840
when the director saw this,

4898
02:19:49,850 --> 02:19:50,200
he went,

4899
02:19:50,200 --> 02:19:51,033
oh wow.

4900
02:19:51,280 --> 02:19:52,550
And who put this video together?

4901
02:19:52,551 --> 02:19:53,031
Who made it?

4902
02:19:53,031 --> 02:19:53,864
Who filmed it?

4903
02:19:54,480 --> 02:19:55,010
Uh,

4904
02:19:55,010 --> 02:19:57,410
the film crew for serious.

4905
02:19:57,650 --> 02:19:58,610
So you,

4906
02:19:58,640 --> 02:19:59,473
uh,

4907
02:20:00,710 --> 02:20:01,543
wow.

4908
02:20:01,550 --> 02:20:03,700
So we have,

4909
02:20:03,810 --> 02:20:05,660
want to make sure we'll clear this.

4910
02:20:05,661 --> 02:20:07,910
You have thousands of these
videos where there's one,

4911
02:20:07,930 --> 02:20:08,120
uh,

4912
02:20:08,120 --> 02:20:08,320
yeah.

4913
02:20:08,320 --> 02:20:09,830
If you go again to this website,

4914
02:20:09,831 --> 02:20:11,430
you'll see that there's a section for the,

4915
02:20:12,020 --> 02:20:16,790
where the contact expeditions in the c
five expeditions and a couple of years

4916
02:20:16,790 --> 02:20:17,350
ago we were up on,

4917
02:20:17,350 --> 02:20:20,060
now there's a mountain
north of here called Mt.

4918
02:20:20,060 --> 02:20:21,140
Shasta near the Oregon border,

4919
02:20:21,360 --> 02:20:22,070
um,

4920
02:20:22,070 --> 02:20:23,120
in the cascade range.

4921
02:20:23,240 --> 02:20:24,540
And it's a volcanic mountain.

4922
02:20:24,541 --> 02:20:28,130
And we've gone up there a number of years
and we've had these objects that have

4923
02:20:28,131 --> 02:20:31,250
appeared and one of them
was actually in the field.

4924
02:20:31,770 --> 02:20:32,140
Um,

4925
02:20:32,140 --> 02:20:36,200
we had their night vision camera
running and it lifted up and does this.

4926
02:20:36,201 --> 02:20:36,600
And then this,

4927
02:20:36,600 --> 02:20:39,050
like this corkscrew in d
materialize in the sky.

4928
02:20:39,080 --> 02:20:42,290
We have this on video tape and it was
during one of these expeditions and it's a

4929
02:20:42,291 --> 02:20:43,190
really amazing,

4930
02:20:43,550 --> 02:20:44,300
um,

4931
02:20:44,300 --> 02:20:45,130
bit of video.

4932
02:20:45,130 --> 02:20:46,880
Is Ball lightening a real phenomenon?

4933
02:20:48,040 --> 02:20:48,440
Uh,

4934
02:20:48,440 --> 02:20:48,741
Oh yeah,

4935
02:20:48,741 --> 02:20:49,250
sure,

4936
02:20:49,250 --> 02:20:49,590
sure.

4937
02:20:49,590 --> 02:20:49,920
And that,

4938
02:20:49,920 --> 02:20:50,441
that's not it.

4939
02:20:50,441 --> 02:20:51,470
This is clear skies,

4940
02:20:51,471 --> 02:20:55,070
no weather coming up from the
ground but don't they but,

4941
02:20:55,150 --> 02:20:57,740
but doesn't ball lightning
to have something to do with,

4942
02:20:57,750 --> 02:20:57,950
uh,

4943
02:20:57,950 --> 02:20:58,420
there's,

4944
02:20:58,420 --> 02:20:59,920
there's certain types of,

4945
02:20:59,930 --> 02:21:04,310
of visual phenomenon that have to do
with tectonic plates and pressure and

4946
02:21:04,311 --> 02:21:04,940
stress.

4947
02:21:04,940 --> 02:21:05,750
Pizo Electric.

4948
02:21:05,750 --> 02:21:05,961
Yeah.

4949
02:21:05,961 --> 02:21:08,540
What do you know what that's very
different also that be just sort of a

4950
02:21:08,541 --> 02:21:09,141
discharge,

4951
02:21:09,141 --> 02:21:11,720
like an electrical discharge
and that's from the rocks.

4952
02:21:11,720 --> 02:21:15,590
And usually it's when there's quartz
depressure of it into an electromagnetic

4953
02:21:15,591 --> 02:21:17,180
energy will build up in Oberst burst out.

4954
02:21:17,510 --> 02:21:17,901
But you know,

4955
02:21:17,901 --> 02:21:20,330
this is an object and you can
see it quite clearly and it's,

4956
02:21:20,331 --> 02:21:21,110
uh,

4957
02:21:21,110 --> 02:21:23,840
it's right at the edge of the speed of
light cause it's kind of coming in and

4958
02:21:23,841 --> 02:21:24,740
out of this dimension.

4959
02:21:24,980 --> 02:21:27,140
It's a really great video
and there were like 30,

4960
02:21:27,141 --> 02:21:28,550
40 people who saw this happen.

4961
02:21:28,910 --> 02:21:29,420
Um,

4962
02:21:29,420 --> 02:21:30,380
so we do this.

4963
02:21:30,381 --> 02:21:32,510
I've been doing this for 22 years.

4964
02:21:32,540 --> 02:21:33,373
And um,

4965
02:21:33,770 --> 02:21:34,603
uh,

4966
02:21:34,760 --> 02:21:35,091
what would he,

4967
02:21:35,091 --> 02:21:36,200
what are you showing up there Brian?

4968
02:21:36,230 --> 02:21:36,531
What is,

4969
02:21:36,531 --> 02:21:37,360
uh,

4970
02:21:37,360 --> 02:21:38,750
it was one of these
objects that came over.

4971
02:21:38,751 --> 02:21:39,980
I think that was at Mount Shasta.

4972
02:21:40,400 --> 02:21:40,761
I'm not sure.

4973
02:21:40,761 --> 02:21:42,920
It's my laser and it was this
object that came right over.

4974
02:21:43,430 --> 02:21:43,910
And you know,

4975
02:21:43,910 --> 02:21:46,580
we also train people who always
go out with satellite charts.

4976
02:21:46,880 --> 02:21:47,461
No,

4977
02:21:47,461 --> 02:21:47,991
w you know,

4978
02:21:47,991 --> 02:21:52,010
so you know when the satellite footage
of this thing flying in the sky.

4979
02:21:52,070 --> 02:21:52,903
Yup.

4980
02:21:52,910 --> 02:21:53,690
Whoa.

4981
02:21:53,690 --> 02:21:54,980
And if that's your laser,

4982
02:21:55,010 --> 02:21:55,401
that's my,

4983
02:21:55,401 --> 02:21:55,940
I have a big,

4984
02:21:55,940 --> 02:21:56,071
you know,

4985
02:21:56,071 --> 02:21:56,904
it's one of these,

4986
02:21:57,110 --> 02:21:57,943
I got one of those.

4987
02:21:58,100 --> 02:21:58,341
Yeah,

4988
02:21:58,341 --> 02:21:59,150
it'll go away.

4989
02:21:59,150 --> 02:21:59,931
It'll go a hundred,

4990
02:21:59,931 --> 02:22:01,220
200 miles in the space.

4991
02:22:01,250 --> 02:22:02,083
Um,

4992
02:22:02,120 --> 02:22:02,481
to,

4993
02:22:02,481 --> 02:22:03,200
uh,

4994
02:22:03,200 --> 02:22:03,711
now when you,

4995
02:22:03,711 --> 02:22:04,790
when you were filming this,

4996
02:22:05,050 --> 02:22:06,320
are you trying to contact them?

4997
02:22:06,321 --> 02:22:06,890
Like what are you trying,

4998
02:22:06,890 --> 02:22:07,311
we had,

4999
02:22:07,311 --> 02:22:09,770
so we do the protocols where
you do the remote viewing,

5000
02:22:09,820 --> 02:22:10,910
set up the vector,

5001
02:22:11,100 --> 02:22:12,110
show them where you are.

5002
02:22:12,560 --> 02:22:14,750
We played these electronic
tones in the space.

5003
02:22:14,751 --> 02:22:17,210
And then have electronic
field detectors out there.

5004
02:22:17,211 --> 02:22:19,520
So we'll have magnetic field detectors,

5005
02:22:19,970 --> 02:22:21,500
various lasers detectors,

5006
02:22:21,880 --> 02:22:23,570
other electromagnetic spectrum.

5007
02:22:23,780 --> 02:22:24,890
And those will begin to go.

5008
02:22:25,650 --> 02:22:28,730
And then we'll have an object fly over
like this object here that was right near

5009
02:22:28,740 --> 02:22:30,510
as it comes right outside.

5010
02:22:30,780 --> 02:22:35,780
So what people have to understand is
that if you have an object that is coming

5011
02:22:37,770 --> 02:22:40,380
in and out of dimensions,

5012
02:22:40,770 --> 02:22:44,400
it's not going to necessarily look like
a seven 47 or even a flying saucer.

5013
02:22:44,730 --> 02:22:46,590
It's going to be in various energy forms.

5014
02:22:46,591 --> 02:22:48,720
And this is the weird sort of effect.

5015
02:22:49,080 --> 02:22:49,913
Uh,

5016
02:22:50,070 --> 02:22:55,070
most people don't understand that 99%
of the time an interstellar civilization

5017
02:22:55,411 --> 02:22:58,770
doesn't have to be in linear space
time if they have that kind of physics.

5018
02:22:59,130 --> 02:23:03,300
So what happens when you go beyond the
speed of light or you're going to not

5019
02:23:03,301 --> 02:23:04,260
have anything visible,

5020
02:23:04,261 --> 02:23:08,640
but if you begin to have
an energy discharge into an
area of space and it's very

5021
02:23:08,641 --> 02:23:10,260
close to this dimension,

5022
02:23:10,440 --> 02:23:13,350
it'll start to give off
an energy field or corona.

5023
02:23:13,860 --> 02:23:18,860
And so one of the witnesses we have was
that a nuclear hot base out in Oklahoma

5024
02:23:19,351 --> 02:23:20,340
back a years ago,

5025
02:23:20,341 --> 02:23:21,510
I think it was in the 70s.

5026
02:23:21,990 --> 02:23:24,450
And there was this object
that was in the shape of Ufo,

5027
02:23:24,451 --> 02:23:25,440
but it wasn't solid.

5028
02:23:25,680 --> 02:23:26,700
And it flew over the,

5029
02:23:26,760 --> 02:23:27,600
what they call the hot,

5030
02:23:27,601 --> 02:23:27,751
you know,

5031
02:23:27,751 --> 02:23:30,960
with the jets were hot load with
nuclear weapons and the alarms went off.

5032
02:23:31,170 --> 02:23:33,240
But he says this thing was not solid.

5033
02:23:33,241 --> 02:23:34,074
Like this is,

5034
02:23:34,210 --> 02:23:34,620
uh,

5035
02:23:34,620 --> 02:23:35,520
like your rock salt.

5036
02:23:35,740 --> 02:23:36,090
Um,

5037
02:23:36,090 --> 02:23:36,923
it was,

5038
02:23:37,410 --> 02:23:38,610
you could have walked right through it,

5039
02:23:38,640 --> 02:23:40,650
but it was in the shape of a craft,

5040
02:23:41,010 --> 02:23:44,940
but it was shifted so that
the matter was all energy.

5041
02:23:45,000 --> 02:23:46,260
And of course matter is energy.

5042
02:23:46,590 --> 02:23:50,850
So the physics behind this gets into
some really arcane stuff probably beyond

5043
02:23:50,851 --> 02:23:51,780
the scope of the show.

5044
02:23:51,930 --> 02:23:52,830
But it's what I,

5045
02:23:53,070 --> 02:23:57,510
this is part of what we're teaching people
when we take them out is how do these

5046
02:23:57,511 --> 02:23:58,410
objects appear?

5047
02:23:58,950 --> 02:23:59,970
What might you see?

5048
02:24:00,510 --> 02:24:02,190
And I was talking to a,

5049
02:24:02,191 --> 02:24:07,191
an actor here in town who had one of
these happen near his home and it was very

5050
02:24:09,840 --> 02:24:11,130
palpable and very real,

5051
02:24:11,400 --> 02:24:12,233
but it wasn't,

5052
02:24:12,570 --> 02:24:13,830
can you tell us who the actor was?

5053
02:24:15,560 --> 02:24:17,040
Because now there are no,

5054
02:24:17,041 --> 02:24:17,371
but he,

5055
02:24:17,371 --> 02:24:17,671
you know,

5056
02:24:17,671 --> 02:24:17,821
the,

5057
02:24:17,821 --> 02:24:18,181
these are,

5058
02:24:18,181 --> 02:24:20,130
there are a lot of people who've
had these sort of experiences.

5059
02:24:20,130 --> 02:24:25,130
They don't want to talk about it because
they're afraid of being ridiculed and,

5060
02:24:26,010 --> 02:24:27,660
but you know,

5061
02:24:28,110 --> 02:24:29,010
when it was described to me,

5062
02:24:29,011 --> 02:24:29,211
I said,

5063
02:24:29,211 --> 02:24:29,401
well yeah,

5064
02:24:29,401 --> 02:24:30,091
that's classic.

5065
02:24:30,091 --> 02:24:30,924
They really,

5066
02:24:30,990 --> 02:24:31,261
I said,

5067
02:24:31,261 --> 02:24:32,010
yeah,

5068
02:24:32,010 --> 02:24:32,820
because if it's,

5069
02:24:32,820 --> 02:24:34,860
if it's not a lucky Martin,

5070
02:24:35,490 --> 02:24:36,323
you know,

5071
02:24:36,440 --> 02:24:39,090
antigravity and it's really as CT,

5072
02:24:39,360 --> 02:24:40,560
the weirder it is,

5073
02:24:40,561 --> 02:24:42,030
the more likely it is to be Iti.

5074
02:24:42,600 --> 02:24:44,970
And this gets into the whole question,

5075
02:24:44,971 --> 02:24:46,110
what are you looking for?

5076
02:24:46,260 --> 02:24:49,740
So we train people to know kind
of what to look for versus,

5077
02:24:49,770 --> 02:24:50,101
you know,

5078
02:24:50,101 --> 02:24:51,540
if experimental aircraft,

5079
02:24:52,170 --> 02:24:53,250
normal aircraft,

5080
02:24:53,480 --> 02:24:53,880
you know,

5081
02:24:53,880 --> 02:24:55,170
space objects in junk,

5082
02:24:55,560 --> 02:24:55,800
uh,

5083
02:24:55,800 --> 02:24:57,960
satellites and then the stuff,

5084
02:24:57,961 --> 02:24:58,670
that's

5085
02:24:58,670 --> 02:24:59,870
the weird end of it.

5086
02:25:00,020 --> 02:25:01,280
So the weird end of it.

5087
02:25:01,380 --> 02:25:01,650
Yeah,

5088
02:25:01,650 --> 02:25:02,750
they're really cool stuff.

5089
02:25:03,060 --> 02:25:03,800
Really cool stuff.

5090
02:25:03,800 --> 02:25:05,090
You take these people,

5091
02:25:05,091 --> 02:25:06,500
you bring them out to the high desert,

5092
02:25:06,740 --> 02:25:11,330
you tune them into whatever frequency
through whatever methods of meditation or,

5093
02:25:11,331 --> 02:25:12,164
or what have you.

5094
02:25:12,380 --> 02:25:16,340
And these ships are they just waiting
for someone to like email them,

5095
02:25:16,790 --> 02:25:17,810
send them a signal?

5096
02:25:18,280 --> 02:25:19,120
You know what I think,

5097
02:25:19,121 --> 02:25:22,540
I think that they've actually been
waiting a long time for people to do

5098
02:25:22,541 --> 02:25:23,374
something.

5099
02:25:23,980 --> 02:25:25,240
Just passively look at them.

5100
02:25:25,340 --> 02:25:26,031
Did they have to,

5101
02:25:26,031 --> 02:25:28,880
but what I'm saying is do they
have to like load up the ship?

5102
02:25:28,881 --> 02:25:29,181
Hey,

5103
02:25:29,181 --> 02:25:30,890
we got some fucking people in the desert.

5104
02:25:31,320 --> 02:25:33,320
Everybody get on board now let's go,

5105
02:25:33,321 --> 02:25:33,850
let's go.

5106
02:25:33,850 --> 02:25:34,101
Ha.

5107
02:25:34,101 --> 02:25:36,350
And then how are you
getting them to manifest?

5108
02:25:37,270 --> 02:25:38,110
I'm not getting them to,

5109
02:25:38,111 --> 02:25:39,580
but how is anybody getting,

5110
02:25:39,730 --> 02:25:40,420
how was it,

5111
02:25:40,420 --> 02:25:43,300
how was the signal being
recognized by them?

5112
02:25:43,330 --> 02:25:47,110
Because I'm quite convinced they have
electronics that pick up on this,

5113
02:25:47,200 --> 02:25:48,120
what we were talking about earlier,

5114
02:25:48,130 --> 02:25:52,090
this conscious field of coherent
thought and this is again the most

5115
02:25:52,091 --> 02:25:56,050
controversial and of what I'm doing it
to me it's the most interesting also,

5116
02:25:56,470 --> 02:25:56,950
um,

5117
02:25:56,950 --> 02:25:57,101
you know,

5118
02:25:57,101 --> 02:25:57,940
before it was a doctor,

5119
02:25:57,941 --> 02:25:59,200
I was a meditation teacher.

5120
02:25:59,500 --> 02:26:00,280
I don't know if you know that,

5121
02:26:00,280 --> 02:26:00,550
but,

5122
02:26:00,550 --> 02:26:01,280
um,

5123
02:26:01,280 --> 02:26:01,410
no,

5124
02:26:01,410 --> 02:26:02,120
I didn't know that was it.

5125
02:26:02,120 --> 02:26:03,030
What type of meditation?

5126
02:26:03,400 --> 02:26:07,840
A mantra in vedic Vedanta
and vedic meditation.

5127
02:26:08,350 --> 02:26:08,950
Um,

5128
02:26:08,950 --> 02:26:09,790
and uh,

5129
02:26:10,120 --> 02:26:10,391
you know,

5130
02:26:10,391 --> 02:26:14,530
I learned Sanskrit and learn
to teach people meditation.

5131
02:26:14,531 --> 02:26:17,630
So that was my first sort of career,

5132
02:26:17,770 --> 02:26:18,870
if you can call it a career,

5133
02:26:18,871 --> 02:26:21,400
it was an avocation as much
as more than a vocation.

5134
02:26:21,401 --> 02:26:22,540
But um,

5135
02:26:23,320 --> 02:26:23,980
and I really,

5136
02:26:23,980 --> 02:26:26,320
and it was caused as a result
of this near death experience.

5137
02:26:26,320 --> 02:26:26,461
And,

5138
02:26:26,461 --> 02:26:27,090
and,

5139
02:26:27,090 --> 02:26:31,070
and I began to realize
that really the thing that,

5140
02:26:31,270 --> 02:26:36,270
that is most intriguing about all this
is that free energy is like late 18

5141
02:26:37,511 --> 02:26:42,511
hundreds to mid 19 hundreds
antigravity mid forties to mid fifties.

5142
02:26:43,510 --> 02:26:48,010
The science of consciousness and the
interface between mind and matter,

5143
02:26:48,100 --> 02:26:49,390
mind and body,

5144
02:26:49,720 --> 02:26:52,300
mind and thought in
electromagnetic systems.

5145
02:26:52,780 --> 02:26:54,130
That's the really cool stuff.

5146
02:26:54,160 --> 02:26:54,850
And that's,

5147
02:26:54,850 --> 02:26:55,061
you know,

5148
02:26:55,061 --> 02:26:55,894
to me,

5149
02:26:56,240 --> 02:26:59,020
most people know me for the disclosure
project and these other things,

5150
02:26:59,021 --> 02:27:02,200
but to me that's the most exciting part
of this because that is the frontier.

5151
02:27:02,350 --> 02:27:04,990
The final from tier is not
space is consciousness.

5152
02:27:05,590 --> 02:27:08,380
So you take these people out,

5153
02:27:08,381 --> 02:27:11,620
there's 20 of them and you
spend how many days out there?

5154
02:27:12,040 --> 02:27:12,550
Um,

5155
02:27:12,550 --> 02:27:12,801
it's,

5156
02:27:12,801 --> 02:27:14,410
it's usually six days and nights.

5157
02:27:14,411 --> 02:27:15,710
And um,

5158
02:27:16,660 --> 02:27:19,420
so we go out during the day,

5159
02:27:19,450 --> 02:27:24,450
it's more a teaching module and teaching
them a remote viewing concepts and

5160
02:27:25,090 --> 02:27:26,230
science of consciousness.

5161
02:27:26,400 --> 02:27:26,860
Um,

5162
02:27:26,860 --> 02:27:28,570
other information they need to have.

5163
02:27:28,780 --> 02:27:30,130
Then we go out at night,

5164
02:27:30,131 --> 02:27:34,030
usually from around sunset to one
or so in the morning sometimes too.

5165
02:27:34,480 --> 02:27:35,313
Um,

5166
02:27:35,470 --> 02:27:39,730
and we're in out in the
stars making observation,

5167
02:27:39,970 --> 02:27:42,970
doing the remote viewing practice
and then people go home and do it.

5168
02:27:42,971 --> 02:27:46,870
But there's now something like 11 or
1200 teams all over the world doing this,

5169
02:27:46,871 --> 02:27:47,260
that we,

5170
02:27:47,260 --> 02:27:48,940
that or have picked up on this idea.

5171
02:27:49,360 --> 02:27:49,570
Uh,

5172
02:27:49,570 --> 02:27:50,980
it's really a phenomenal thing.

5173
02:27:51,040 --> 02:27:51,640
And um,

5174
02:27:51,640 --> 02:27:54,310
people are having amazing slidings
and experiences all over the world.

5175
02:27:54,311 --> 02:27:56,140
There's a global CE five initiative,

5176
02:27:56,610 --> 02:27:57,040
uh,

5177
02:27:57,040 --> 02:27:58,550
going on and um,

5178
02:27:59,300 --> 02:27:59,650
it's,

5179
02:27:59,650 --> 02:28:00,483
it's really exciting.

5180
02:28:00,700 --> 02:28:01,630
Ce Five,

5181
02:28:03,460 --> 02:28:04,450
which is visual.

5182
02:28:04,570 --> 02:28:05,070
No,

5183
02:28:05,070 --> 02:28:05,340
what does,

5184
02:28:05,340 --> 02:28:05,630
what does it,

5185
02:28:05,630 --> 02:28:05,771
okay,

5186
02:28:05,771 --> 02:28:06,381
let me explain to you,

5187
02:28:06,381 --> 02:28:07,020
I'm sorry,

5188
02:28:07,020 --> 02:28:08,440
I don't know the movie,

5189
02:28:08,500 --> 02:28:11,350
the third kind of Steven
Spielberg's movie.

5190
02:28:11,590 --> 02:28:12,423
That's how I know this.

5191
02:28:13,070 --> 02:28:14,320
Most people are probably like me.

5192
02:28:14,321 --> 02:28:17,920
They don't pay in the fourth kind is when
someone feels they've had contact and

5193
02:28:17,921 --> 02:28:18,730
been on board.

5194
02:28:18,730 --> 02:28:20,890
The fifth kind is a term that I,

5195
02:28:20,930 --> 02:28:21,763
um,

5196
02:28:21,860 --> 02:28:22,660
uh,

5197
02:28:22,660 --> 02:28:23,360
uh,

5198
02:28:23,360 --> 02:28:26,210
launched a and the concept of in 1990,

5199
02:28:26,480 --> 02:28:30,500
which is when humans instead of passively
having to all those others close

5200
02:28:30,501 --> 02:28:31,251
encounters as the first,

5201
02:28:31,251 --> 02:28:31,521
second,

5202
02:28:31,521 --> 02:28:33,310
third and fourth kind or passive,

5203
02:28:33,320 --> 02:28:36,230
could you saw her either seen it or
it's a landing thing or what have you.

5204
02:28:36,470 --> 02:28:40,040
A close encounter of the fifth kind is
when a human does something interactive.

5205
02:28:40,400 --> 02:28:41,031
So it's like,

5206
02:28:41,031 --> 02:28:41,720
you know,

5207
02:28:41,720 --> 02:28:45,110
it's like the Internet versus
something passive or where you're,

5208
02:28:45,230 --> 02:28:50,230
you're actually making
contact and inviting the
civilizations to appear and make

5209
02:28:50,751 --> 02:28:52,490
contact for diplomatic purpose,

5210
02:28:52,810 --> 02:28:53,181
um,

5211
02:28:53,181 --> 02:28:54,950
or where they interact.

5212
02:28:55,250 --> 02:28:59,210
And Dr. Haynes at Nasa Ames put together,

5213
02:28:59,600 --> 02:29:00,260
uh,

5214
02:29:00,260 --> 02:29:01,093
a great book,

5215
02:29:01,150 --> 02:29:01,400
uh,

5216
02:29:01,400 --> 02:29:02,020
based on,

5217
02:29:02,020 --> 02:29:04,910
on my initial research on this called
close encounters of the fifth time.

5218
02:29:05,450 --> 02:29:06,530
I'm CE five,

5219
02:29:06,590 --> 02:29:07,970
where he collected cases.

5220
02:29:08,210 --> 02:29:09,830
We both collected cases,

5221
02:29:09,831 --> 02:29:11,960
but he published this book some years ago,

5222
02:29:11,990 --> 02:29:12,350
um,

5223
02:29:12,350 --> 02:29:13,183
about,

5224
02:29:13,460 --> 02:29:13,820
uh,

5225
02:29:13,820 --> 02:29:17,600
all these people who had done this and
some of them were quite incidental.

5226
02:29:17,600 --> 02:29:18,121
For example,

5227
02:29:18,121 --> 02:29:22,430
a craft is there and the person
sees it and instead of just gaping,

5228
02:29:22,460 --> 02:29:26,630
they actually signaled to it with say
a a light and it signals back and comes

5229
02:29:26,631 --> 02:29:27,350
over.

5230
02:29:27,350 --> 02:29:30,410
The more interesting ones are the ones
I discovered that which is what happened

5231
02:29:30,411 --> 02:29:35,180
to me when I was 18 where you see a craft
and you just think moved to the left

5232
02:29:35,181 --> 02:29:35,931
and moves to the left,

5233
02:29:35,931 --> 02:29:36,621
move to the right,

5234
02:29:36,621 --> 02:29:37,454
move to the right.

5235
02:29:37,730 --> 02:29:42,260
And they're showing you that there's a
link up between intent and thought and

5236
02:29:42,261 --> 02:29:43,210
their electronics.

5237
02:29:43,450 --> 02:29:44,960
And that's the really cool stuff.

5238
02:29:45,090 --> 02:29:46,940
You remember how many young Carl Young?

5239
02:29:47,240 --> 02:29:47,720
Yes.

5240
02:29:47,720 --> 02:29:48,051
What did you,

5241
02:29:48,051 --> 02:29:52,250
what do you think on co he wrote a whole
book on the physical manifestation of

5242
02:29:52,251 --> 02:29:53,990
Ufos through the conscious thought.

5243
02:29:55,220 --> 02:29:55,491
Yeah.

5244
02:29:55,491 --> 02:29:59,400
Well I mean the world
is as you are and um,

5245
02:29:59,510 --> 02:30:02,810
it depends on the level of consciousness
of the person reading what he wrote.

5246
02:30:03,110 --> 02:30:03,943
Um,

5247
02:30:04,220 --> 02:30:05,630
I think that a lot of people say,

5248
02:30:05,631 --> 02:30:06,464
well that means that you're,

5249
02:30:06,660 --> 02:30:08,540
everything is being
manifested by your mind.

5250
02:30:08,870 --> 02:30:09,320
Well,

5251
02:30:09,320 --> 02:30:10,310
but in a sense,

5252
02:30:10,311 --> 02:30:12,680
all of reality is one conscious thought.

5253
02:30:12,770 --> 02:30:13,521
If you want to look good,

5254
02:30:13,521 --> 02:30:14,510
get back into the hole.

5255
02:30:14,511 --> 02:30:17,000
All this is that concept of the vedic.

5256
02:30:17,330 --> 02:30:18,680
But I think,

5257
02:30:18,681 --> 02:30:19,514
uh,

5258
02:30:20,330 --> 02:30:22,490
these are things when you
have 30 or 40 people see it

5259
02:30:24,890 --> 02:30:25,790
and it's interactive,

5260
02:30:26,540 --> 02:30:27,140
you know,

5261
02:30:27,140 --> 02:30:28,490
it's a close encounter
with the fifth kind.

5262
02:30:28,700 --> 02:30:30,830
So it's not your imagination doing that.

5263
02:30:31,090 --> 02:30:31,250
Um,

5264
02:30:31,250 --> 02:30:32,490
particularly didn't get video.

5265
02:30:32,770 --> 02:30:35,410
I don't actually think he was
necessarily saying it's your imagination.

5266
02:30:35,650 --> 02:30:35,831
No,

5267
02:30:35,831 --> 02:30:35,921
no.

5268
02:30:35,921 --> 02:30:36,311
But he was,

5269
02:30:36,311 --> 02:30:36,640
you know,

5270
02:30:36,640 --> 02:30:39,790
a lot of people don't understand what
he was saying and I think that he was

5271
02:30:39,791 --> 02:30:40,870
taught really talking about some,

5272
02:30:40,871 --> 02:30:42,760
a deeper aspect of what his mind,

5273
02:30:42,940 --> 02:30:43,271
right.

5274
02:30:43,271 --> 02:30:44,410
What is modern mind,

5275
02:30:44,470 --> 02:30:47,500
what effect does consciousness
have on physical matter?

5276
02:30:47,530 --> 02:30:47,840
Right.

5277
02:30:47,840 --> 02:30:48,510
It's huge.

5278
02:30:48,510 --> 02:30:49,343
It's huge.

5279
02:30:49,720 --> 02:30:53,020
And in a sense he could have almost
been validating it without totally

5280
02:30:53,021 --> 02:30:56,500
understanding the possibilities of
contacting something when we're making

5281
02:30:56,501 --> 02:30:56,930
something.

5282
02:30:56,930 --> 02:30:57,580
I agree.

5283
02:30:57,580 --> 02:30:57,970
I agree.

5284
02:30:57,970 --> 02:30:58,803
You,

5285
02:30:59,090 --> 02:31:01,180
you seem to be convinced of,

5286
02:31:01,190 --> 02:31:01,781
and in fact,

5287
02:31:01,781 --> 02:31:02,501
teach people to do it.

5288
02:31:02,501 --> 02:31:04,270
I think that if you've
got something like that,

5289
02:31:04,450 --> 02:31:09,450
how has this not like on 2020 or
whatever those stupid new shows are,

5290
02:31:09,820 --> 02:31:14,110
how will you not going well you'd be
willing to do that with a film crew.

5291
02:31:14,220 --> 02:31:16,890
Oh we did with CBS with
Dan Rather had a show,

5292
02:31:16,891 --> 02:31:18,090
I'm back a years ago.

5293
02:31:18,091 --> 02:31:18,924
What was it called?

5294
02:31:19,190 --> 02:31:19,580
Um,

5295
02:31:19,580 --> 02:31:23,670
we went down to Mexico and it Popo and
we did this in a craft came up by the,

5296
02:31:23,730 --> 02:31:27,930
by the volcano flu and they were filming
this with professional stuff and they

5297
02:31:27,931 --> 02:31:28,650
ended up uh,

5298
02:31:28,650 --> 02:31:31,520
completely debunking at end
even though the camera guy and,

5299
02:31:31,521 --> 02:31:32,570
and the uh,

5300
02:31:32,670 --> 02:31:34,800
reporter who was there with me said,

5301
02:31:34,980 --> 02:31:37,020
anyone who sees this
will know this is real.

5302
02:31:37,230 --> 02:31:39,060
And CBS sanitized it.

5303
02:31:39,300 --> 02:31:40,230
And when I then said,

5304
02:31:40,231 --> 02:31:40,501
look,

5305
02:31:40,501 --> 02:31:42,690
you agreed in writing
that any footage you get,

5306
02:31:42,691 --> 02:31:44,670
you would share with us
if we did this expedition.

5307
02:31:44,671 --> 02:31:46,230
Cause we did it on our own expense.

5308
02:31:46,590 --> 02:31:46,951
They,

5309
02:31:46,951 --> 02:31:47,211
the,

5310
02:31:47,211 --> 02:31:51,720
the person in charge there said received
bs and we're part of a corporation has

5311
02:31:51,721 --> 02:31:52,890
billions and you don't,

5312
02:31:52,950 --> 02:31:54,200
you will fight you for,

5313
02:31:54,310 --> 02:31:57,750
you'll never get this footage needs CBS
though it seems like you'd be able to

5314
02:31:57,751 --> 02:32:00,420
film something like that
yourself and really high quality.

5315
02:32:00,421 --> 02:32:01,560
You don't need their footage.

5316
02:32:01,620 --> 02:32:02,131
What we do,

5317
02:32:02,131 --> 02:32:03,210
I mean we have a certain amount,

5318
02:32:03,211 --> 02:32:04,620
I don't operate cameras,

5319
02:32:04,621 --> 02:32:05,041
but we,

5320
02:32:05,041 --> 02:32:08,730
we've had volunteers but we've never
had professional cruise with us.

5321
02:32:08,731 --> 02:32:11,460
And I mean at some point it'd be
nice if we could do this and I'm a

5322
02:32:11,461 --> 02:32:12,031
professional,

5323
02:32:12,031 --> 02:32:13,080
I have a crew,

5324
02:32:13,320 --> 02:32:15,840
I have a new show that's coming
out on the SCIFI network.

5325
02:32:15,960 --> 02:32:16,231
Oh really?

5326
02:32:16,231 --> 02:32:16,801
What's it's called?

5327
02:32:16,801 --> 02:32:18,210
Question everything and good.

5328
02:32:18,211 --> 02:32:19,044
One of the things,

5329
02:32:19,530 --> 02:32:20,120
yeah,

5330
02:32:20,120 --> 02:32:23,540
and one of the things we're going to do
is we're going to explore things like

5331
02:32:23,541 --> 02:32:24,980
Ufo was big foot.

5332
02:32:25,020 --> 02:32:27,620
I'm going to go to the Pacific
northwest and look for bigfoot,

5333
02:32:27,980 --> 02:32:29,300
but I want to,

5334
02:32:30,870 --> 02:32:33,440
let's go to the Atacama desert
and see if we can find him.

5335
02:32:34,030 --> 02:32:34,863
Let's go,

5336
02:32:35,000 --> 02:32:35,460
man.

5337
02:32:35,460 --> 02:32:35,670
I would,

5338
02:32:35,670 --> 02:32:39,880
I would be more than happy to go and
bring a professional crew and see if,

5339
02:32:39,881 --> 02:32:40,150
uh,

5340
02:32:40,150 --> 02:32:41,170
something like this can happen.

5341
02:32:41,320 --> 02:32:43,330
What kind of success rate
do you have in doing this?

5342
02:32:44,960 --> 02:32:45,793
Uh,

5343
02:32:45,970 --> 02:32:46,360
well,

5344
02:32:46,360 --> 02:32:46,601
you know,

5345
02:32:46,601 --> 02:32:49,900
we've never actually gone out where there
hasn't been some kind of a siding or

5346
02:32:49,901 --> 02:32:51,790
event happened that had
been seen by everyone.

5347
02:32:51,970 --> 02:32:52,803
Really.

5348
02:32:52,870 --> 02:32:53,290
Never.

5349
02:32:53,290 --> 02:32:54,370
So it's 100%,

5350
02:32:54,730 --> 02:32:56,440
not every night and not all the time,

5351
02:32:56,441 --> 02:32:56,850
but yes.

5352
02:32:56,850 --> 02:32:58,780
Something of five or six day period.

5353
02:32:58,900 --> 02:33:00,310
And are these people camping out there?

5354
02:33:00,370 --> 02:33:00,551
No,

5355
02:33:00,551 --> 02:33:00,880
no,

5356
02:33:00,880 --> 02:33:01,130
no.

5357
02:33:01,130 --> 02:33:01,901
We don't stay.

5358
02:33:01,901 --> 02:33:02,171
Well,

5359
02:33:02,171 --> 02:33:02,500
I mean,

5360
02:33:02,500 --> 02:33:03,490
I guess if someone wanted to,

5361
02:33:03,491 --> 02:33:07,060
we usually stay in condos or houses or
something in the area we usually go to

5362
02:33:07,061 --> 02:33:08,090
fairly knows,

5363
02:33:09,090 --> 02:33:09,810
you know,

5364
02:33:09,810 --> 02:33:10,270
Eh,

5365
02:33:10,270 --> 02:33:12,880
remote areas that are a quiet,

5366
02:33:13,270 --> 02:33:16,390
it's very hard to find locations where
we're not going to be intruded upon.

5367
02:33:16,391 --> 02:33:17,830
And usually when we do this,

5368
02:33:18,190 --> 02:33:18,610
um,

5369
02:33:18,610 --> 02:33:19,830
we do have people who intrude.

5370
02:33:19,990 --> 02:33:20,570
Um,

5371
02:33:20,570 --> 02:33:20,880
and,

5372
02:33:20,880 --> 02:33:22,300
and so we try to keep it,

5373
02:33:22,330 --> 02:33:22,571
you know,

5374
02:33:22,571 --> 02:33:25,700
so that the group can be coherent
because the whole concept of,

5375
02:33:25,701 --> 02:33:28,060
of this is coherent
thought and coherent mind.

5376
02:33:28,090 --> 02:33:28,880
And,

5377
02:33:28,880 --> 02:33:29,670
uh,

5378
02:33:29,670 --> 02:33:30,230
that's,

5379
02:33:30,230 --> 02:33:30,461
you know,

5380
02:33:30,461 --> 02:33:33,370
very difficult to do when you're
being disrupted by a lot of folks.

5381
02:33:33,430 --> 02:33:36,040
Know what if you pick 20 people to go and,

5382
02:33:36,041 --> 02:33:36,301
and,

5383
02:33:36,301 --> 02:33:36,740
and how,

5384
02:33:36,740 --> 02:33:38,340
how do you know that someone's not alone?

5385
02:33:38,350 --> 02:33:40,000
He takes some crackpot.

5386
02:33:40,030 --> 02:33:40,241
Oh,

5387
02:33:40,241 --> 02:33:40,511
well,

5388
02:33:40,511 --> 02:33:41,910
there had been no,

5389
02:33:41,950 --> 02:33:42,790
usually the people,

5390
02:33:42,791 --> 02:33:42,941
you know,

5391
02:33:42,941 --> 02:33:44,500
we have an application process and,

5392
02:33:44,790 --> 02:33:45,000
and I,

5393
02:33:45,000 --> 02:33:45,221
I,

5394
02:33:45,221 --> 02:33:46,054
you know,

5395
02:33:46,150 --> 02:33:49,300
I'd say 99% of the time
they're just wonderful people.

5396
02:33:49,630 --> 02:33:50,980
And you know,

5397
02:33:51,070 --> 02:33:54,400
they're very sincerely interested
in learning about this.

5398
02:33:54,430 --> 02:33:59,430
And I think the science of consciousness
component of the whole what JL and

5399
02:34:00,181 --> 02:34:03,130
Harnett called the High
Strangeness Part of Ufo Encounters,

5400
02:34:03,580 --> 02:34:04,413
um,

5401
02:34:04,450 --> 02:34:08,800
is becomes very compelling for people
who have had contact and understand that

5402
02:34:08,801 --> 02:34:11,590
when you go beyond the speed
of light between star systems,

5403
02:34:11,830 --> 02:34:12,790
you're dealing with,

5404
02:34:13,080 --> 02:34:13,570
uh,

5405
02:34:13,570 --> 02:34:15,280
something that's way beyond,

5406
02:34:15,620 --> 02:34:16,330
uh,

5407
02:34:16,330 --> 02:34:16,810
your,

5408
02:34:16,810 --> 02:34:17,980
your phone and,

5409
02:34:18,110 --> 02:34:19,300
and a Ford explorer.

5410
02:34:19,660 --> 02:34:20,021
And,

5411
02:34:20,021 --> 02:34:21,400
and people who get that,

5412
02:34:21,430 --> 02:34:25,240
who get out of the linear box and
begin to look at that and then begin to

5413
02:34:25,241 --> 02:34:27,190
experiment with a lot of
the people who come on.

5414
02:34:27,191 --> 02:34:30,070
These are people who have gotten
the APP or learned about it.

5415
02:34:30,250 --> 02:34:31,150
And they try it at,

5416
02:34:31,360 --> 02:34:35,710
try this at home and they have an amazing
citing an encounter with a small group

5417
02:34:35,711 --> 02:34:39,010
of people or a family and then they
want to come and try and do it more.

5418
02:34:39,280 --> 02:34:39,850
So,

5419
02:34:39,850 --> 02:34:40,683
um,

5420
02:34:40,740 --> 02:34:40,990
uh,

5421
02:34:40,990 --> 02:34:41,191
it,

5422
02:34:41,191 --> 02:34:41,471
it's,

5423
02:34:41,471 --> 02:34:42,304
it's uh,

5424
02:34:42,790 --> 02:34:44,310
an excite to me that's the,

5425
02:34:44,311 --> 02:34:44,650
the,

5426
02:34:44,650 --> 02:34:46,360
the next phase of all this is,

5427
02:34:46,510 --> 02:34:46,721
you know,

5428
02:34:46,721 --> 02:34:47,321
disclosure,

5429
02:34:47,321 --> 02:34:49,210
bring out the energy and technologies,

5430
02:34:49,420 --> 02:34:51,490
but then it's about the
public understanding that,

5431
02:34:51,970 --> 02:34:52,451
what does it,

5432
02:34:52,451 --> 02:34:55,960
everyone just go out under the stars
instead of sitting and looking at

5433
02:34:55,961 --> 02:34:58,450
television and try some experiments,

5434
02:34:58,480 --> 02:34:59,410
experiment with,

5435
02:34:59,411 --> 02:35:01,050
with thought in mind,

5436
02:35:01,120 --> 02:35:05,200
light and tone and all kinds of
interesting things and space.

5437
02:35:05,500 --> 02:35:08,280
Haven't you encountered
things that are uh,

5438
02:35:08,380 --> 02:35:11,350
in closer proximity to the ground?

5439
02:35:11,860 --> 02:35:12,370
Oh yeah.

5440
02:35:12,370 --> 02:35:17,370
And have some very odd photographs of
what you might call a trans dimensional

5441
02:35:18,280 --> 02:35:19,510
images that looked like a,

5442
02:35:19,570 --> 02:35:23,680
almost like a Hologram of a bean that
floated right outside of our circle at

5443
02:35:23,681 --> 02:35:25,120
Joshua tree national park.

5444
02:35:25,210 --> 02:35:26,350
Not too far from here.

5445
02:35:26,770 --> 02:35:28,850
A back a few years ago about Theresa,

5446
02:35:28,910 --> 02:35:29,680
this thing.

5447
02:35:29,680 --> 02:35:30,340
Yup.

5448
02:35:30,340 --> 02:35:30,730
Yup.

5449
02:35:30,730 --> 02:35:32,590
Where can someone see that as
one of the websites series,

5450
02:35:32,591 --> 02:35:33,580
disclosure.com.

5451
02:35:33,581 --> 02:35:36,250
If you link to the CE five part of it,

5452
02:35:36,251 --> 02:35:39,490
there's a whole section of
this strange luminous thing.

5453
02:35:39,850 --> 02:35:40,360
Um,

5454
02:35:40,360 --> 02:35:41,770
and you know,

5455
02:35:41,771 --> 02:35:42,040
a,

5456
02:35:42,040 --> 02:35:43,120
the photograph of that.

5457
02:35:43,121 --> 02:35:44,950
It was a three or four second exposure.

5458
02:35:45,280 --> 02:35:47,200
And what was seen right
before this happened,

5459
02:35:47,201 --> 02:35:50,260
which is really important for people to
understand what something about half the

5460
02:35:50,261 --> 02:35:50,801
size of the,

5461
02:35:50,801 --> 02:35:52,990
about the size of my
fist or a little bigger.

5462
02:35:53,290 --> 02:35:55,750
It was like a sphere that
floated over the desert.

5463
02:35:56,710 --> 02:35:57,543
Um,

5464
02:35:57,700 --> 02:35:58,331
and uh,

5465
02:35:58,331 --> 02:36:01,540
November of Oh nine and
several people saw it.

5466
02:36:01,900 --> 02:36:06,010
And then we heard what sounded
like a group of people talking,

5467
02:36:06,460 --> 02:36:07,091
but with our nights,

5468
02:36:07,091 --> 02:36:07,990
cause there's nothing there.

5469
02:36:08,650 --> 02:36:09,280
And then,

5470
02:36:09,280 --> 02:36:14,280
so a woman on my team took her camera
and it just had a three or four second

5471
02:36:14,621 --> 02:36:15,340
exposure,

5472
02:36:15,340 --> 02:36:16,270
took a photograph.

5473
02:36:16,510 --> 02:36:18,850
And in that area where this had happened,

5474
02:36:19,450 --> 02:36:21,700
there was this beam that was,

5475
02:36:21,701 --> 02:36:22,534
uh,

5476
02:36:23,310 --> 02:36:25,360
and did you see this
with your eyes or is it,

5477
02:36:25,361 --> 02:36:25,721
you know,

5478
02:36:25,721 --> 02:36:27,790
cause this would have been in a flash,

5479
02:36:27,791 --> 02:36:28,900
but it's in the digital.

5480
02:36:28,960 --> 02:36:30,610
Is it possible that it's just an artifact?

5481
02:36:30,630 --> 02:36:31,150
No,

5482
02:36:31,150 --> 02:36:31,990
it's not an artifact.

5483
02:36:31,991 --> 02:36:32,650
Absolutely not.

5484
02:36:32,650 --> 02:36:33,640
Why is that not possible?

5485
02:36:33,910 --> 02:36:35,830
Flashes always produce artifacts.

5486
02:36:35,831 --> 02:36:36,664
It produced,

5487
02:36:36,700 --> 02:36:36,940
no,

5488
02:36:36,940 --> 02:36:37,151
no,

5489
02:36:37,151 --> 02:36:38,830
she did not use a flash.

5490
02:36:38,860 --> 02:36:39,150
Oh,

5491
02:36:39,150 --> 02:36:40,180
it was visible.

5492
02:36:40,390 --> 02:36:41,530
The flash was so,

5493
02:36:41,531 --> 02:36:42,130
in other words,

5494
02:36:42,130 --> 02:36:43,930
this was no flash bulb.

5495
02:36:43,960 --> 02:36:44,500
No,

5496
02:36:44,500 --> 02:36:46,690
we don't allow flash
photography when we're out.

5497
02:36:46,890 --> 02:36:47,711
You've got to have good nights.

5498
02:36:47,711 --> 02:36:48,011
Goats,

5499
02:36:48,011 --> 02:36:48,910
you have to have good cameras.

5500
02:36:48,911 --> 02:36:50,710
You can adjust the ISO and the,

5501
02:36:50,711 --> 02:36:51,910
and the aperture and all that.

5502
02:36:52,480 --> 02:36:52,900
Um,

5503
02:36:52,900 --> 02:36:53,620
campfires.

5504
02:36:53,620 --> 02:36:54,100
Hmm.

5505
02:36:54,100 --> 02:36:54,311
No,

5506
02:36:54,311 --> 02:36:55,240
we never have camp fires.

5507
02:36:55,720 --> 02:36:56,920
There's a complete darkness.

5508
02:36:57,340 --> 02:36:58,173
Um,

5509
02:36:58,840 --> 02:37:01,690
the most you're going to see when
we're out there has made me an led on a

5510
02:37:01,691 --> 02:37:02,524
camera.

5511
02:37:03,310 --> 02:37:05,050
So whatever this thing was,

5512
02:37:05,210 --> 02:37:06,043
we know what it was.

5513
02:37:06,370 --> 02:37:08,950
You think it was very
confident about what it was.

5514
02:37:10,120 --> 02:37:12,430
Have you ever been a board,

5515
02:37:12,460 --> 02:37:14,560
a spatial and a well,

5516
02:37:14,561 --> 02:37:15,394
you know,

5517
02:37:15,620 --> 02:37:16,453
um,

5518
02:37:17,090 --> 02:37:22,090
I've had some really amazing contact
experiences that are classic and they,

5519
02:37:22,670 --> 02:37:23,211
you know,

5520
02:37:23,211 --> 02:37:23,480
uh,

5521
02:37:23,480 --> 02:37:24,500
I had one when I was,

5522
02:37:24,530 --> 02:37:25,363
uh,

5523
02:37:25,400 --> 02:37:25,940
having,

5524
02:37:25,940 --> 02:37:26,360
uh,

5525
02:37:26,360 --> 02:37:30,720
this eight when I was 18 years
old up on this mountain up in,

5526
02:37:30,770 --> 02:37:31,603
uh,

5527
02:37:31,850 --> 02:37:32,270
uh,

5528
02:37:32,270 --> 02:37:32,471
and,

5529
02:37:32,471 --> 02:37:33,980
and it,

5530
02:37:33,990 --> 02:37:34,823
it was,

5531
02:37:35,810 --> 02:37:39,290
it wasn't at all what you hear about in
the literature because it was more in

5532
02:37:39,291 --> 02:37:40,970
this trans dimensional element,

5533
02:37:41,210 --> 02:37:41,810
uh,

5534
02:37:41,810 --> 02:37:42,643
area.

5535
02:37:42,740 --> 02:37:47,600
And that becomes the whole question is
what part of what people are reporting is

5536
02:37:47,601 --> 02:37:49,670
real and what part is memorex.

5537
02:37:49,850 --> 02:37:51,530
And this is something we
haven't talked about yet,

5538
02:37:52,130 --> 02:37:56,600
but what is the capacity for the
intelligence community to hoax contact?

5539
02:37:57,320 --> 02:37:58,370
And it's substantial.

5540
02:37:59,150 --> 02:37:59,750
Really?

5541
02:37:59,750 --> 02:38:00,583
Yeah.

5542
02:38:00,700 --> 02:38:02,060
You think a lot of people they,

5543
02:38:02,080 --> 02:38:03,460
they're hoaxing contact

5544
02:38:03,880 --> 02:38:04,270
yeah.

5545
02:38:04,270 --> 02:38:06,040
For scaring the hell out of people.

5546
02:38:06,240 --> 02:38:06,871
Like in what way?

5547
02:38:06,871 --> 02:38:07,704
How do they do that?

5548
02:38:08,100 --> 02:38:08,933
Uh,

5549
02:38:09,280 --> 02:38:12,760
one of the things we learned about a
number of years ago is actually not

5550
02:38:12,761 --> 02:38:13,690
something I discovered.

5551
02:38:13,691 --> 02:38:17,250
It was a man here who was looking into um,

5552
02:38:17,770 --> 02:38:22,140
what are called military related
abductions that are made to look at ut but

5553
02:38:22,160 --> 02:38:22,960
aren't.

5554
02:38:22,960 --> 02:38:27,760
And you get into this whole question of
what are they able to stage craft two

5555
02:38:27,790 --> 02:38:28,301
for four,

5556
02:38:28,301 --> 02:38:29,950
it's psychological warfare value.

5557
02:38:30,310 --> 02:38:33,520
And I have a document that's actually
gonna be in the film and it's from the

5558
02:38:33,521 --> 02:38:38,080
strategic studies institute talking
about the staging of abductions and other

5559
02:38:38,081 --> 02:38:41,200
scary things to create
fear around the UFO issue.

5560
02:38:41,210 --> 02:38:44,450
So they create an artificial
spacecraft and abducting.

5561
02:38:44,451 --> 02:38:44,690
Yeah.

5562
02:38:44,690 --> 02:38:45,523
Well they might use,

5563
02:38:45,680 --> 02:38:47,030
they may use what's called an arb,

5564
02:38:47,031 --> 02:38:49,240
an alien reproduction
vehicle that's manmade.

5565
02:38:49,250 --> 02:38:52,400
They may use robotic
things that are called pls,

5566
02:38:52,640 --> 02:38:56,030
program life forms that are
manmade but look very easy

5567
02:38:56,470 --> 02:38:57,410
lifeforms,

5568
02:38:57,440 --> 02:38:57,640
yeah,

5569
02:38:57,640 --> 02:38:58,270
pls,

5570
02:38:58,270 --> 02:38:58,870
they have,

5571
02:38:58,870 --> 02:39:00,850
they have lifeforms that,

5572
02:39:00,880 --> 02:39:04,900
that are like robots essentially
that move around like people.

5573
02:39:05,530 --> 02:39:06,000
Uh,

5574
02:39:06,000 --> 02:39:09,810
there are reports of that
and in fact a ports of that.

5575
02:39:09,900 --> 02:39:10,860
And I think there is,

5576
02:39:10,861 --> 02:39:11,790
if you leave it though,

5577
02:39:12,120 --> 02:39:12,421
oh yeah.

5578
02:39:12,421 --> 02:39:13,710
I think Stan Rome and neck,

5579
02:39:13,711 --> 02:39:16,200
if you look at the photograph he had of,

5580
02:39:16,210 --> 02:39:16,680
uh,

5581
02:39:16,680 --> 02:39:17,300
this thing,

5582
02:39:17,300 --> 02:39:17,580
uh,

5583
02:39:17,580 --> 02:39:20,370
I think he was on Larry King or
in some other shows in this thing,

5584
02:39:20,371 --> 02:39:21,860
bu that goes up and down.

5585
02:39:21,861 --> 02:39:24,170
He's got a photo and then
there's a video that,

5586
02:39:24,180 --> 02:39:24,350
uh,

5587
02:39:24,350 --> 02:39:25,200
he hasn't released,

5588
02:39:25,201 --> 02:39:27,420
but I've seen it in other
people in the team have seen it.

5589
02:39:27,720 --> 02:39:29,520
And it's this very robotic looking.

5590
02:39:29,600 --> 02:39:31,200
It looks like a quote alien,

5591
02:39:31,470 --> 02:39:32,460
but we know it isn't.

5592
02:39:32,760 --> 02:39:33,290
I mean,

5593
02:39:33,290 --> 02:39:33,691
so I,

5594
02:39:33,691 --> 02:39:33,961
you know,

5595
02:39:33,961 --> 02:39:35,940
the question is why would they
want to do something like that?

5596
02:39:36,040 --> 02:39:39,150
I think if you can put enough
information out there to scale,

5597
02:39:39,180 --> 02:39:40,020
scare people,

5598
02:39:40,620 --> 02:39:41,320
why not

5599
02:39:41,320 --> 02:39:41,771
scare all,

5600
02:39:41,771 --> 02:39:46,570
it seems to me though that look at the
highest level robotics experts in the

5601
02:39:46,571 --> 02:39:50,430
world today are pretty open about
their work because they're there.

5602
02:39:50,450 --> 02:39:51,640
But these are showing,

5603
02:39:51,670 --> 02:39:52,091
I mean they're,

5604
02:39:52,091 --> 02:39:52,331
they're,

5605
02:39:52,331 --> 02:39:52,571
they're,

5606
02:39:52,571 --> 02:39:54,120
they're showing periodic improvements.

5607
02:39:54,140 --> 02:39:56,620
The general public like that Darpa robots,

5608
02:39:56,770 --> 02:39:58,150
what they're doing in Japan.

5609
02:39:58,420 --> 02:39:58,690
No,

5610
02:39:58,690 --> 02:40:02,350
no one has come anywhere close to
doing something along those lines.

5611
02:40:02,530 --> 02:40:03,221
Not only that,

5612
02:40:03,221 --> 02:40:05,710
they all have an external power source.

5613
02:40:05,890 --> 02:40:06,041
Yeah.

5614
02:40:06,041 --> 02:40:09,520
But you're assuming that the things
that you know about her or all that,

5615
02:40:09,540 --> 02:40:11,350
they're an existence,

5616
02:40:11,380 --> 02:40:12,610
but it's like saying that,

5617
02:40:13,080 --> 02:40:13,890
uh,

5618
02:40:13,890 --> 02:40:18,750
because you haven't flown on a one to
lock heats or Northrop's antigravity

5619
02:40:18,751 --> 02:40:19,201
devices.

5620
02:40:19,201 --> 02:40:20,100
They don't have those either.

5621
02:40:20,430 --> 02:40:22,260
I think that yes,

5622
02:40:22,500 --> 02:40:22,711
they do.

5623
02:40:22,711 --> 02:40:23,060
Absolutely.

5624
02:40:23,060 --> 02:40:23,970
100% yes.

5625
02:40:24,460 --> 02:40:25,860
How has it been rich all but said,

5626
02:40:25,861 --> 02:40:26,611
so you know,

5627
02:40:26,611 --> 02:40:28,050
who's the head of Lockheed Skunk works?

5628
02:40:28,410 --> 02:40:28,980
Um,

5629
02:40:28,980 --> 02:40:33,650
so these are a lot of the things that
people will see out near the Nellis

5630
02:40:33,650 --> 02:40:33,660
Ranger,

5631
02:40:33,660 --> 02:40:35,430
so called area 51 that are,

5632
02:40:35,640 --> 02:40:36,900
are moving in decent ways.

5633
02:40:36,901 --> 02:40:37,830
We were talking about earlier,

5634
02:40:38,070 --> 02:40:39,000
those are manmade.

5635
02:40:39,001 --> 02:40:39,834
There's aren't AET.

5636
02:40:40,080 --> 02:40:42,300
And if you go all way back to,

5637
02:40:42,560 --> 02:40:43,110
uh,

5638
02:40:43,110 --> 02:40:44,010
the forties in,

5639
02:40:44,020 --> 02:40:44,970
in Germany,

5640
02:40:44,971 --> 02:40:49,320
during World War II and after they were
doing a lot of experiments with things

5641
02:40:50,070 --> 02:40:53,100
that do electromagnetic lifter effect.

5642
02:40:53,430 --> 02:40:55,320
And going back a little further,

5643
02:40:55,530 --> 02:40:57,630
you look at t Townsend Brown in 19,

5644
02:40:57,780 --> 02:40:58,950
late 1920s,

5645
02:40:59,340 --> 02:40:59,581
uh,

5646
02:40:59,581 --> 02:41:03,000
and then also the Closky frost experiment
where they actually were able to

5647
02:41:03,001 --> 02:41:05,520
create this effect of
Levitation and movement.

5648
02:41:05,790 --> 02:41:06,210
So,

5649
02:41:06,210 --> 02:41:06,421
you know,

5650
02:41:06,421 --> 02:41:06,751
again,

5651
02:41:06,751 --> 02:41:08,040
there's a whole science here.

5652
02:41:08,520 --> 02:41:11,940
And in the open aerospace
literature in the late forties,

5653
02:41:11,941 --> 02:41:12,774
early fifties,

5654
02:41:12,840 --> 02:41:16,560
they were saying the next big thing is
gravity control an antigravity stuff and

5655
02:41:16,561 --> 02:41:16,770
Dah,

5656
02:41:16,770 --> 02:41:16,980
Dah,

5657
02:41:16,980 --> 02:41:17,310
Dah.

5658
02:41:17,310 --> 02:41:18,570
And then it went all white and black.

5659
02:41:18,870 --> 02:41:19,800
You can't find it.

5660
02:41:20,070 --> 02:41:20,510
And,

5661
02:41:20,510 --> 02:41:20,730
uh,

5662
02:41:20,730 --> 02:41:23,400
one of the guys that I've worked
with at the naval research labs,

5663
02:41:24,390 --> 02:41:26,190
which is the largest
department defense lab,

5664
02:41:26,670 --> 02:41:27,090
um,

5665
02:41:27,090 --> 02:41:32,090
told me that it was October 54 when we
really mastered gravity control and all

5666
02:41:32,230 --> 02:41:33,510
those projects went black.

5667
02:41:33,540 --> 02:41:34,740
They just disappeared.

5668
02:41:34,920 --> 02:41:36,960
But up until then you
can go back and fine.

5669
02:41:37,230 --> 02:41:37,840
And there were,

5670
02:41:37,840 --> 02:41:38,340
uh,

5671
02:41:38,340 --> 02:41:39,270
in the literature,

5672
02:41:39,680 --> 02:41:40,200
uh,

5673
02:41:40,200 --> 02:41:43,790
now the fact that your average person at
MIT to know about this doesn't mean it

5674
02:41:43,791 --> 02:41:44,624
didn't exist.

5675
02:41:44,700 --> 02:41:49,410
And I think that there's a whole history
of aerospace and technology that's

5676
02:41:49,411 --> 02:41:49,890
hidden.

5677
02:41:49,890 --> 02:41:50,551
Similarly,

5678
02:41:50,551 --> 02:41:54,150
there's a whole history of robotics,

5679
02:41:54,240 --> 02:41:55,073
genetics,

5680
02:41:55,350 --> 02:41:57,420
biological studies and what have you.

5681
02:41:57,840 --> 02:42:00,990
And that that has also
been very classified.

5682
02:42:01,520 --> 02:42:06,520
You are either one really nutty dude or
you are a guy who has tapped into one of

5683
02:42:08,811 --> 02:42:13,190
the craziest pieces of information
that's being suppressed from the American

5684
02:42:13,191 --> 02:42:13,521
public.

5685
02:42:13,521 --> 02:42:15,140
And there's no room for a middle ground.

5686
02:42:15,460 --> 02:42:16,293
You know,

5687
02:42:17,220 --> 02:42:17,520
I'm,

5688
02:42:17,520 --> 02:42:18,360
I know that all,

5689
02:42:18,420 --> 02:42:20,100
every word I'm telling you is true.

5690
02:42:20,240 --> 02:42:20,750
I believe,

5691
02:42:20,750 --> 02:42:24,290
man Wu believe that every word
out of your mouth is true.

5692
02:42:24,291 --> 02:42:25,280
I do believe you.

5693
02:42:26,060 --> 02:42:29,360
But this whole thing
is so it's so strains,

5694
02:42:29,361 --> 02:42:30,100
credibility,

5695
02:42:30,100 --> 02:42:30,781
all it does,

5696
02:42:30,781 --> 02:42:31,400
all of it does.

5697
02:42:31,400 --> 02:42:35,370
And you know what I was told years ago
that if you really told the whole truth

5698
02:42:35,371 --> 02:42:36,204
about this,

5699
02:42:36,510 --> 02:42:38,610
that'll hide itself cause
no one can believe it.

5700
02:42:39,180 --> 02:42:40,620
So you know,

5701
02:42:40,960 --> 02:42:44,400
it is kind of through the looking
glass and down the rabbit hole on this

5702
02:42:44,401 --> 02:42:44,851
subject.

5703
02:42:44,851 --> 02:42:49,851
And it's a real problem because how far
do you go in terms of telling what you

5704
02:42:50,761 --> 02:42:52,050
know and have discovered?

5705
02:42:52,250 --> 02:42:52,440
Well,

5706
02:42:52,440 --> 02:42:53,273
it seems to me

5707
02:42:53,350 --> 02:42:55,920
and Hampton to like a way to show people.

5708
02:42:57,110 --> 02:42:57,440
Yeah,

5709
02:42:57,440 --> 02:42:58,430
well I mean if,

5710
02:42:58,460 --> 02:42:59,570
but who's looking at me?

5711
02:42:59,571 --> 02:43:00,850
It's like the CFA guy,

5712
02:43:00,980 --> 02:43:02,030
John Callahan who said,

5713
02:43:02,270 --> 02:43:03,380
I've got the radar tapes,

5714
02:43:03,381 --> 02:43:04,430
I got the pilot reports,

5715
02:43:04,610 --> 02:43:06,140
but who's looking and who's asking?

5716
02:43:06,330 --> 02:43:06,680
Right.

5717
02:43:06,680 --> 02:43:07,700
Well not 20,

5718
02:43:07,701 --> 02:43:08,360
20.

5719
02:43:08,360 --> 02:43:08,811
You know what I mean?

5720
02:43:08,811 --> 02:43:09,860
You asked about 2020.

5721
02:43:10,150 --> 02:43:10,610
Uh,

5722
02:43:10,610 --> 02:43:13,300
the guy was executive producer
of that came out to my house.

5723
02:43:13,600 --> 02:43:17,680
I gave him 35 hours at digital
stuff of all these top secret guys,

5724
02:43:17,710 --> 02:43:18,880
all the documents,

5725
02:43:18,881 --> 02:43:19,714
all this stuff.

5726
02:43:19,720 --> 02:43:20,111
He said,

5727
02:43:20,111 --> 02:43:21,490
this is the biggest story.

5728
02:43:21,491 --> 02:43:24,520
It's either all a hoax or it's
the biggest story in history.

5729
02:43:24,550 --> 02:43:24,851
I said,

5730
02:43:24,851 --> 02:43:25,001
yeah,

5731
02:43:25,001 --> 02:43:26,440
well I think it's the latter.

5732
02:43:26,980 --> 02:43:27,521
And he says,

5733
02:43:27,521 --> 02:43:28,690
I want to do this story.

5734
02:43:28,700 --> 02:43:29,051
I said,

5735
02:43:29,051 --> 02:43:30,100
I don't think they'll let you.

5736
02:43:31,030 --> 02:43:33,730
And so we went back to corporate ABC and

5737
02:43:35,700 --> 02:43:37,180
a couple of weeks later he's a Dr. Greer.

5738
02:43:37,181 --> 02:43:38,980
They won't let me do this story.

5739
02:43:39,430 --> 02:43:39,731
I said,

5740
02:43:39,731 --> 02:43:40,564
who are they,

5741
02:43:40,810 --> 02:43:41,620
IRA?

5742
02:43:41,620 --> 02:43:42,190
And he said,

5743
02:43:42,190 --> 02:43:42,341
well,

5744
02:43:42,341 --> 02:43:43,270
you know who they are.

5745
02:43:44,320 --> 02:43:45,760
And I've had producers.

5746
02:43:45,761 --> 02:43:45,941
They're like,

5747
02:43:45,941 --> 02:43:47,000
that's crazy motherfucker.

5748
02:43:47,190 --> 02:43:48,023
What else?

5749
02:43:48,320 --> 02:43:50,530
This was the executive
producer in charge of the show.

5750
02:43:50,580 --> 02:43:54,920
Both the primetime live in 2020 and um,

5751
02:43:55,270 --> 02:43:56,830
he's now with the 60 minutes.

5752
02:43:56,831 --> 02:43:59,260
But I think that what
we'll love to talk to him.

5753
02:43:59,470 --> 02:44:00,303
What's his name?

5754
02:44:00,310 --> 02:44:00,730
Yeah,

5755
02:44:00,730 --> 02:44:01,563
Ira Rosen.

5756
02:44:01,570 --> 02:44:03,940
I love to talk to him on the question.

5757
02:44:03,941 --> 02:44:04,774
Everything show.

5758
02:44:04,900 --> 02:44:05,860
That'd be fascinating.

5759
02:44:06,250 --> 02:44:06,670
Well,

5760
02:44:06,670 --> 02:44:06,911
you know,

5761
02:44:06,911 --> 02:44:07,501
I think that the,

5762
02:44:07,501 --> 02:44:07,711
the,

5763
02:44:07,711 --> 02:44:12,130
this is the other big myth is that when
you start dealing with the big media

5764
02:44:12,460 --> 02:44:13,570
that it's a free media.

5765
02:44:13,750 --> 02:44:14,920
It's free to a point.

5766
02:44:14,921 --> 02:44:15,161
I mean,

5767
02:44:15,161 --> 02:44:18,370
it's no problem if you want to
drill down on someone's sex scandal.

5768
02:44:18,610 --> 02:44:20,350
But if you really want
to deal with this issue,

5769
02:44:20,351 --> 02:44:22,070
there's going to be a phone call and you,

5770
02:44:22,080 --> 02:44:23,020
one of the documents,

5771
02:44:23,021 --> 02:44:24,580
it's a up on our website,

5772
02:44:25,090 --> 02:44:28,210
I wrote an article called a media play.

5773
02:44:28,450 --> 02:44:33,450
And in it is a document I got from the
1990s from the CIA that talks about how

5774
02:44:34,540 --> 02:44:39,160
the CIA had embedded in all the
major media people to change,

5775
02:44:39,190 --> 02:44:40,220
alter or,

5776
02:44:40,310 --> 02:44:41,680
or stop stories.

5777
02:44:42,100 --> 02:44:44,020
And this is an official document.

5778
02:44:44,380 --> 02:44:44,861
So you know,

5779
02:44:44,861 --> 02:44:47,950
if the public listening out there think
we really have a free market and free

5780
02:44:47,951 --> 02:44:48,740
media,

5781
02:44:48,740 --> 02:44:48,981
you know,

5782
02:44:48,981 --> 02:44:49,391
you know,

5783
02:44:49,391 --> 02:44:51,490
wake up and this is simply not the case.

5784
02:44:51,491 --> 02:44:53,290
So I think that one of the,

5785
02:44:53,291 --> 02:44:57,760
one of the challenges
we've had is that the,

5786
02:44:58,000 --> 02:44:58,241
the,

5787
02:44:58,241 --> 02:44:58,540
the,

5788
02:44:58,540 --> 02:44:59,680
it's kind of a,

5789
02:45:00,160 --> 02:45:02,740
an article of faith that
if all this were true,

5790
02:45:03,460 --> 02:45:05,860
wouldn't immediate just
really want to cover this.

5791
02:45:06,520 --> 02:45:07,353
And I say,

5792
02:45:07,420 --> 02:45:07,810
yeah,

5793
02:45:07,810 --> 02:45:10,780
there were some really good people
in the media who've wanted to,

5794
02:45:11,050 --> 02:45:11,890
but they're not allowed to.

5795
02:45:12,480 --> 02:45:12,701
And so,

5796
02:45:12,701 --> 02:45:13,391
and then this good way,

5797
02:45:13,391 --> 02:45:15,040
who controls the big media?

5798
02:45:15,630 --> 02:45:18,960
I'm not talking about your show because
I'm talking to how many shows are out

5799
02:45:18,961 --> 02:45:20,820
there dedicated to
looking for Ufo was there,

5800
02:45:20,821 --> 02:45:23,940
seems like there's quite a bit and
they'll see those shows are owned by,

5801
02:45:24,480 --> 02:45:24,841
you know,

5802
02:45:24,841 --> 02:45:27,160
big media companies and networks that,

5803
02:45:27,190 --> 02:45:28,470
that promote these shows.

5804
02:45:29,010 --> 02:45:29,970
It's just bullshit.

5805
02:45:29,971 --> 02:45:32,970
And what they're doing is paying lip
service to it and not really looking and

5806
02:45:32,971 --> 02:45:36,450
they're just covering the controversial
aspects of it to get viewers.

5807
02:45:36,451 --> 02:45:36,691
Yes.

5808
02:45:36,691 --> 02:45:37,610
I think a lot of it's shocking.

5809
02:45:37,650 --> 02:45:38,970
Dribble in Britain circus.

5810
02:45:39,180 --> 02:45:41,460
And I think that you
didn't ask the question of,

5811
02:45:41,670 --> 02:45:42,380
you know,

5812
02:45:42,380 --> 02:45:45,200
years ago when I was on Larry King and
the afterwards I got this note from his

5813
02:45:45,201 --> 02:45:45,750
produce said,

5814
02:45:45,750 --> 02:45:45,990
you know,

5815
02:45:45,990 --> 02:45:48,090
this is one of the most
popular shows we've ever had.

5816
02:45:48,870 --> 02:45:53,280
And so if it was just about ratings and
just about whether there was anything

5817
02:45:53,290 --> 02:45:54,510
legitimate there to cover,

5818
02:45:54,720 --> 02:45:56,370
this would be in the news all the time.

5819
02:45:56,430 --> 02:46:01,140
So there's something weird going on
here because they'll cover all kinds of

5820
02:46:01,230 --> 02:46:02,940
sensationalistic nonsense.

5821
02:46:03,240 --> 02:46:03,721
But you know,

5822
02:46:03,721 --> 02:46:05,700
you have dozens of top secret witnesses,

5823
02:46:05,701 --> 02:46:07,590
you have legitimate government documents,

5824
02:46:07,591 --> 02:46:08,341
you have photographs,

5825
02:46:08,341 --> 02:46:08,850
video,

5826
02:46:08,850 --> 02:46:10,120
or you have teams like ours going

5827
02:46:10,120 --> 02:46:12,880
out having these sorts of
experiences that isn't covered.

5828
02:46:13,390 --> 02:46:14,710
You have to ask the question why.

5829
02:46:14,950 --> 02:46:19,950
And I think the wonderful thing about
2013 that didn't exist five or 10 years

5830
02:46:21,521 --> 02:46:22,354
ago,

5831
02:46:22,900 --> 02:46:23,590
Twitter,

5832
02:46:23,590 --> 02:46:24,423
Facebook,

5833
02:46:24,520 --> 02:46:25,570
video on demand,

5834
02:46:25,810 --> 02:46:26,021
you know,

5835
02:46:26,021 --> 02:46:28,360
you don't have to go to a big distributor.

5836
02:46:28,560 --> 02:46:28,801
We're,

5837
02:46:28,801 --> 02:46:29,201
and actually,

5838
02:46:29,201 --> 02:46:29,920
by the way,

5839
02:46:29,920 --> 02:46:33,280
we're planning to distribute this
film at the night of the premiere.

5840
02:46:33,340 --> 02:46:35,620
Maybe we'll live stream and if
we can figure out how to do it,

5841
02:46:36,140 --> 02:46:36,973
maybe you can help us.

5842
02:46:37,180 --> 02:46:37,600
Um,

5843
02:46:37,600 --> 02:46:38,260
I'll be happy to,

5844
02:46:38,260 --> 02:46:38,950
um,

5845
02:46:38,950 --> 02:46:41,370
we need help with it actually
because we're actually out of funds.

5846
02:46:41,470 --> 02:46:44,930
Well Production Brad Ustream
livestream to show this,

5847
02:46:44,931 --> 02:46:45,340
but yeah.

5848
02:46:45,340 --> 02:46:45,910
Yeah.

5849
02:46:45,910 --> 02:46:48,970
And so what we want to do at the premiers
live stream it and then have the thing

5850
02:46:49,000 --> 02:46:51,880
and then it'll be VOD video
on demand so that you know,

5851
02:46:51,881 --> 02:46:54,940
there are no choke holds in the big media
and then you couldn't have done that

5852
02:46:55,120 --> 02:46:57,100
five or 10 years ago
with any kind of value.

5853
02:46:57,400 --> 02:46:58,660
Now you can do high definition,

5854
02:46:58,661 --> 02:46:59,650
you can do really good,

5855
02:46:59,740 --> 02:47:03,880
good video on demand and we're going to
do this so that everyone can sign up to

5856
02:47:03,881 --> 02:47:05,950
be an affiliate distributor.

5857
02:47:06,310 --> 02:47:09,730
So that basically if you
want to distribute to show,

5858
02:47:09,760 --> 02:47:10,330
you can,

5859
02:47:10,330 --> 02:47:13,090
you can distribute it and
the people who see it,

5860
02:47:13,091 --> 02:47:13,361
you know,

5861
02:47:13,361 --> 02:47:17,740
there'll be a small fee to see it and
then you'll have part of that and you just

5862
02:47:17,860 --> 02:47:18,700
build that out.

5863
02:47:18,701 --> 02:47:22,090
Because what we want to do is make this
thing go viral so that we don't get into

5864
02:47:22,091 --> 02:47:25,660
the choke holds of the big media because,

5865
02:47:25,960 --> 02:47:26,620
um,

5866
02:47:26,620 --> 02:47:26,891
you know,

5867
02:47:26,891 --> 02:47:27,061
I,

5868
02:47:27,061 --> 02:47:27,380
I,

5869
02:47:27,380 --> 02:47:27,550
uh,

5870
02:47:27,550 --> 02:47:28,970
my experience with it is that I'm,

5871
02:47:28,971 --> 02:47:29,591
I'm very,

5872
02:47:29,591 --> 02:47:34,591
very skeptical of the big media doing
anything with this until they have to.

5873
02:47:35,490 --> 02:47:35,980
Um,

5874
02:47:35,980 --> 02:47:36,170
and,

5875
02:47:36,170 --> 02:47:38,150
and then it becomes where is,

5876
02:47:38,250 --> 02:47:39,310
there's too much noise out there.

5877
02:47:39,311 --> 02:47:41,950
We have to give it a little bit of lip
service and then we'll take it off again.

5878
02:47:42,340 --> 02:47:43,330
So that's why,

5879
02:47:43,331 --> 02:47:43,991
by the way,

5880
02:47:43,991 --> 02:47:46,720
that's why we did this
crowdfunding to this.

5881
02:47:46,820 --> 02:47:50,500
It was that we really wanted the people
to have a stake in it and to move,

5882
02:47:50,530 --> 02:47:52,450
move the film serious forward.

5883
02:47:52,690 --> 02:47:55,690
Because if you went to a
studio or a group of investors,

5884
02:47:55,691 --> 02:47:58,570
you don't know what they're going to
do with it if they control it this way,

5885
02:47:58,720 --> 02:47:59,553
the people on it.

5886
02:48:00,630 --> 02:48:01,090
So,

5887
02:48:01,090 --> 02:48:01,211
well,

5888
02:48:01,211 --> 02:48:01,541
listen,

5889
02:48:01,541 --> 02:48:01,781
man,

5890
02:48:01,781 --> 02:48:03,910
this is a fascinating subject.

5891
02:48:03,940 --> 02:48:04,580
Uh,

5892
02:48:04,580 --> 02:48:05,321
like I said,

5893
02:48:05,321 --> 02:48:10,321
it's one of my personal interest and
it has been since I was a small child,

5894
02:48:10,380 --> 02:48:10,990
uh,

5895
02:48:10,990 --> 02:48:12,070
and a to talk to you,

5896
02:48:12,071 --> 02:48:12,701
it was a real treat.

5897
02:48:12,701 --> 02:48:14,350
I really appreciate it
and we really appreciate,

5898
02:48:14,351 --> 02:48:15,190
put your neck out there,

5899
02:48:15,191 --> 02:48:15,431
man.

5900
02:48:15,431 --> 02:48:18,850
You say a lot of nutty shit and it takes
a lot of courage to do that or you're

5901
02:48:18,851 --> 02:48:19,684
crazy.

5902
02:48:20,620 --> 02:48:22,020
I'm willing to believe you.

5903
02:48:22,030 --> 02:48:22,863
I mean,

5904
02:48:23,110 --> 02:48:23,921
I'm willing to,

5905
02:48:23,921 --> 02:48:24,430
uh,

5906
02:48:24,430 --> 02:48:26,610
be completely open to the point of I'll,

5907
02:48:26,620 --> 02:48:27,820
I'll go out to the desert with you.

5908
02:48:27,821 --> 02:48:28,660
I'll do whatever it is.

5909
02:48:28,900 --> 02:48:29,370
I'm,

5910
02:48:29,370 --> 02:48:29,890
I'm,

5911
02:48:29,890 --> 02:48:30,221
you know,

5912
02:48:30,221 --> 02:48:31,840
I'm fascinated by all this stuff and,

5913
02:48:31,841 --> 02:48:32,140
uh,

5914
02:48:32,140 --> 02:48:34,840
if what you're saying is true,

5915
02:48:34,870 --> 02:48:36,000
it is a,

5916
02:48:36,040 --> 02:48:36,640
you know,

5917
02:48:36,640 --> 02:48:41,530
one of the most mind blowing things
our society is ever had access to.

5918
02:48:41,600 --> 02:48:43,600
It has ever been able to encounter.

5919
02:48:43,601 --> 02:48:44,171
I mean it's,

5920
02:48:44,171 --> 02:48:44,760
uh,

5921
02:48:44,760 --> 02:48:45,850
it's pretty crazy shit man.

5922
02:48:46,160 --> 02:48:47,220
Come to the new millennium.

5923
02:48:47,221 --> 02:48:48,100
Cause now it's time.

5924
02:48:48,150 --> 02:48:48,290

5925
02:48:48,290 --> 02:48:48,491
even,

5926
02:48:48,491 --> 02:48:49,060
here we go.

5927
02:48:49,060 --> 02:48:49,841
I hope you're right.

5928
02:48:49,841 --> 02:48:50,081
I mean,

5929
02:48:50,081 --> 02:48:51,700
I hope this isn't just crazy talk.

5930
02:48:51,730 --> 02:48:52,120
Um,

5931
02:48:52,120 --> 02:48:56,230
April 22nd is the day it's in Los Angeles,

5932
02:48:56,250 --> 02:48:56,500
uh,

5933
02:48:56,500 --> 02:48:57,670
at La live,

5934
02:48:57,671 --> 02:48:58,504
which is where

5935
02:48:58,830 --> 02:49:00,410
it's the regal la live,

5936
02:49:00,420 --> 02:49:01,560
the Regal Elliot La live.

5937
02:49:01,800 --> 02:49:03,120
And how can people,

5938
02:49:03,121 --> 02:49:03,870
uh,

5939
02:49:03,870 --> 02:49:08,870
either find out about this or get to
this or I want to go serious disclosure,

5940
02:49:08,981 --> 02:49:09,410
doc,

5941
02:49:09,410 --> 02:49:09,670
uh,

5942
02:49:09,670 --> 02:49:10,211
calm.

5943
02:49:10,211 --> 02:49:11,800
And you can go there and you can,

5944
02:49:11,830 --> 02:49:12,251
you know,

5945
02:49:12,251 --> 02:49:14,170
get the tickets and everything
is sign up right there.

5946
02:49:14,230 --> 02:49:15,160
Everything would be done online.

5947
02:49:15,310 --> 02:49:16,810
And it is the film done.

5948
02:49:17,350 --> 02:49:18,100
It's uh,

5949
02:49:18,100 --> 02:49:20,860
it's going into final completion
in the next three weeks or so.

5950
02:49:20,920 --> 02:49:21,520
Yeah.

5951
02:49:21,520 --> 02:49:21,851
Okay.

5952
02:49:21,851 --> 02:49:22,210
So,

5953
02:49:22,210 --> 02:49:22,450
uh,

5954
02:49:22,450 --> 02:49:27,040
April 22nd is when it's all going down
and that is hopefully you will already

5955
02:49:27,041 --> 02:49:31,630
have the information from this Ivy League
institute about this alien being by

5956
02:49:31,631 --> 02:49:32,080
then.

5957
02:49:32,080 --> 02:49:32,560
Correct.

5958
02:49:32,560 --> 02:49:34,030
Or this humanoid beings human.

5959
02:49:34,150 --> 02:49:35,020
We don't know what it is.

5960
02:49:35,050 --> 02:49:35,890
Whatever it is.

5961
02:49:36,550 --> 02:49:36,791
Yeah.

5962
02:49:36,791 --> 02:49:37,271
And we will,

5963
02:49:37,271 --> 02:49:38,260
we already have a lot of it,

5964
02:49:38,261 --> 02:49:39,440
but we're waiting for the,

5965
02:49:39,441 --> 02:49:40,060
the final,

5966
02:49:40,060 --> 02:49:41,230
the genetic sequencing.

5967
02:49:41,320 --> 02:49:41,651
Okay.

5968
02:49:41,651 --> 02:49:43,540
And if people want to
follow you on Twitter,

5969
02:49:43,541 --> 02:49:45,640
it's Dr. Steven Greer.

5970
02:49:45,641 --> 02:49:46,690
Stevie,

5971
02:49:46,750 --> 02:49:47,260

but it's with a Ph.

5980
02:49:52,810 --> 02:49:53,980
Who does that somewhere?

5981
02:49:53,981 --> 02:49:55,390
Knows no ph here.

5982
02:49:55,660 --> 02:49:56,140

Okay.
