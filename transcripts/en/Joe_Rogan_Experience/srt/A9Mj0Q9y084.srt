1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:03,790
Um,
my boy woke me up at like every hour.

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:05,230
I'm hoping I didn't have mommy brain

3
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:07,750
boom.
And we're alive.

4
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:10,330
The newly mommy.
Dr Rhonda Patrick.

5
00:00:10,331 --> 00:00:12,430
First of all,
congratulations on making people.

6
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:13,980
Thank you Mandy.
For Person.

7
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:15,980
Yeah,
the colonial project was a success.

8
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:16,560
We were talking

9
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:21,710
for the show about what a strange 
biological shift happens in your mind 

10
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:23,580
and isn't it?
It's amazing,

11
00:00:23,581 --> 00:00:25,320
isn't it?
And not just your mind,

12
00:00:25,321 --> 00:00:26,490
right?
Like your person.

13
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:27,640
Absolutely.
Yeah.

14
00:00:27,641 --> 00:00:32,641
It's completely amazing am.
I had no idea that I would love being a 

15
00:00:32,641 --> 00:00:35,890
mom so much.
I kind of waited till later in life to,

16
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:41,030
to have a child and that was for a 
reason because as you know,

17
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:45,970
really driven and loved what I was doing
in science and I felt I didn't feel that

18
00:00:45,971 --> 00:00:48,410
calling to like I've got to reproduce 
it.

19
00:00:48,411 --> 00:00:50,260
Forgot to reproduce.
And then finally I was like,

20
00:00:50,261 --> 00:00:52,390
well,
if I don't reproduce now I might not get

21
00:00:52,391 --> 00:00:53,170
a chance.
So,

22
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,340
you know,
I,

23
00:00:54,341 --> 00:00:58,420
that sort of pressure kind of nudged me 
a little bit I think.

24
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:00,100
Um,
but yeah,

25
00:01:00,101 --> 00:01:03,750
the whole process of getting pregnant 
and having this like,

26
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:06,670
you know,
person growing inside of me,

27
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:11,790
just the whole thing was amazing.
And then after having the baby and he's 

28
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:16,201
like a person now and he's four months 
old and developing this little 

29
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:19,201
personality,
I'm like so amazed by how in love I am 

30
00:01:20,321 --> 00:01:23,590
with him and how like,
how much I would do anything for him and

31
00:01:23,591 --> 00:01:28,591
how almost nothing really affects me as 
much like stress of various things in 

32
00:01:28,591 --> 00:01:29,140
life,
you know,

33
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:32,260
I just look at him and you know,
see him,

34
00:01:32,261 --> 00:01:37,261
smile at me and do some little things 
that are like uniquely him and the 

35
00:01:37,261 --> 00:01:38,620
wonder and awe in his eyes and it's just
like gone,

36
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:41,440
like,
it's really amazing sound.

37
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:42,470
Yeah,
that's crazy.

38
00:01:42,471 --> 00:01:45,770
It changes your life.
It changes who you are as a human being,

39
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:47,060
you know,
in uh,

40
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:51,920
changes in a way that you did have a lot
of friends that are like,

41
00:01:51,921 --> 00:01:53,450
I don't want kids.
I never wanted kids.

42
00:01:53,451 --> 00:01:55,700
And like wow,
I kind of didn't really want kids either

43
00:01:56,370 --> 00:02:00,980
when I was 30 kids.
But then once you have them,

44
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:04,040
you realized like,
oh,

45
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:09,041
like I was just sort of attached to this
idea of living my life the way I was 

46
00:02:09,041 --> 00:02:09,440
living it,
and I'm like,

47
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:12,650
this is the way I like to live life.
And then you have a kid,

48
00:02:12,651 --> 00:02:13,130
you're like,
oh no,

49
00:02:13,131 --> 00:02:15,680
I love this kid more than anything.
Like.

50
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:20,740
So now my whole idea of what life is 
shifts into this new paradigms and also 

51
00:02:22,551 --> 00:02:26,120
the thing like reproduce always weirds 
me out because you're not,

52
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:28,670
you're making people not reproducing 
anything.

53
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:29,930
You know,
I mean you're,

54
00:02:29,931 --> 00:02:32,780
you're making people.
It's a whole new person.

55
00:02:32,781 --> 00:02:34,130
You're not reproducing you.

56
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,040
True.
I mean it,

57
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:41,310
it is in a way.
I mean there's definitely reproductions 

58
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:41,790
the right way to say you're passing on a
lot of the same,

59
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:46,880
you know,
variations in genes that you have and 

60
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:46,880
you know,
you're obviously,

61
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:50,690
you know,
there are similarities in the way they 

62
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:50,690
look to,
to,

63
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:51,930
to both you and your spouse.
But yeah,

64
00:02:51,931 --> 00:02:54,240
it is a completely new person with a new
personality.

65
00:02:55,110 --> 00:03:00,110
But of course,
all that is shaped a lot by your diet 

66
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:00,110
and exercise

67
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:04,750
and all those things that you do,
even aside from your actual genetics and

68
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:06,790
passing on the sequence of DNA,
like just,

69
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:12,120
you know,
things that you do in your lifestyle 

70
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:12,120
actually can affect,
um,

71
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,690
you know,
the child's neurocognitive development 

72
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:15,690
and uh,
you know,

73
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:19,920
met metabolism now where you cognizant 
of that or you obviously you're very 

74
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:20,200
aware of that.
But did you,

75
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:22,090
what did you do to act on that?
I should ask?

76
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:23,470
Yeah.
So I mean I did.

77
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:28,420
I'm definitely became obsessed with 
trying to optimize everything I could,

78
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:33,680
you know,
because I'm a scientist and I can sort 

79
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:33,680
of sift through the literature.
I think I,

80
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:38,780
you can,
you can kind of get stuck in this loop 

81
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:40,831
where you want to like optimize 
everything and you kind of have to like 

82
00:03:40,831 --> 00:03:40,831
chill out a little bit.
But you know,

83
00:03:40,831 --> 00:03:43,360
during pregnancy I wanted to make sure,
you know,

84
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:45,850
all the micronutrients I was getting,
you know,

85
00:03:45,851 --> 00:03:50,851
because they're so important for brain 
development and like full late 

86
00:03:50,851 --> 00:03:50,851
magnesium,
iron,

87
00:03:50,851 --> 00:03:53,050
zinc,
and then Dha,

88
00:03:53,051 --> 00:03:55,390
vitamin D,
All these things were super important.

89
00:03:55,780 --> 00:04:00,760
I'm actually with the Dha,
I found out that I'm taking,

90
00:04:00,761 --> 00:04:05,761
so Dha is the marine omega three fatty 
acid that's predominantly found in like 

91
00:04:05,761 --> 00:04:09,670
micro algae for vegetarians versus,
but in fish fatty fish,

92
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:15,240
well it turns out that the Dha that's in
what's called phospholipid form,

93
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:19,900
which is something that's found in the 
row of fish.

94
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:24,250
So like fish eggs,
it's also found in Krill as well.

95
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:29,490
Um,
and fish only have like a small 

96
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:31,111
percentage,
so fish have Dha like one percent of 

97
00:04:31,111 --> 00:04:32,080
their djs and phospholipid form.
Whereas the row of the fish,

98
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:35,500
anywhere between 40 to 70 percent is in 
phospholipid form.

99
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:39,520
And the thing that's really cool about 
this is that the fossil liquid form,

100
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:41,500
it's been shown when you take that 
orally,

101
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,770
it stays more of,
it ends up in the phospho lip,

102
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:48,840
a certain type of phospholipid form in 
the blood that has been shown to get 

103
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:52,261
into the developing fetal brain 10 times
better than an Dha and non libet form 

104
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:54,790
free fatty acid form.

105
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,210
So it was just something that should be 
consumed.

106
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:02,500
Look for regular people as well or for 
primarily mothers.

107
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:05,170
So yeah,
for I think both,

108
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:10,350
but the fact that it gets taken up into 
the developing fetal brain 10 times 

109
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:12,640
better was enough,
you know,

110
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:15,430
ammunition for me to be like I'm eating 
the Salmon Roe,

111
00:05:15,431 --> 00:05:16,370
you know,
but,

112
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:18,820
but yeah,
so they're all have also been studies on

113
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,950
preclinical studies on,
on,

114
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:23,740
uh,
taking Dha,

115
00:05:23,741 --> 00:05:26,050
EPA and fossil performing in,
in mice.

116
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:28,650
It's taken up better than non fossil 
Lippitt.

117
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:33,660
And then there's been some clinical 
studies where they like radio label and 

118
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:33,660
follow it in humans.
And again,

119
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:36,430
it's taken up better in the brain by 
humans as well.

120
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:42,060
And actually what's really interesting 
is I just submitted a paper for 

121
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:46,531
publication on Alzheimer's disease and a
certain variation in a gene called apoe 

122
00:05:47,321 --> 00:05:52,321
e four,
which I think you and I talked a lot 

123
00:05:52,321 --> 00:05:52,321
about traumatic brain injury,
um,

124
00:05:52,321 --> 00:05:53,680
and susceptibility to Alzheimer's 
disease.

125
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,950
And basically I'm a bunch of,
you know,

126
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:59,060
dementia type of problems.
Um,

127
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:02,090
well April before sort of helps increase
that risk.

128
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,160
So I've,
you know,

129
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:09,220
turns out there is because there's 
different transport mechanisms to get 

130
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:12,280
Dha into the brain.
The phospholipid form appears to be 

131
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,940
better for April before,
and that's sort of my finding.

132
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,250
I'm not going to get all into the 
mechanism,

133
00:06:16,251 --> 00:06:21,251
but that's hopefully fingers crossed 
going to be accepted for peer review 

134
00:06:21,251 --> 00:06:21,650
from peer review with the next couple 
months.

135
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:24,260
That's fascinating.
So you eating Salmon Roe,

136
00:06:24,261 --> 00:06:26,510
that's what you were saying you were 
getting your source from?

137
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,200
I was,
yeah,

138
00:06:27,201 --> 00:06:28,970
I was,
I was eating Salmon Roe.

139
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:31,580
Um,
I was ordering it from a company that,

140
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:34,580
you know,
has wild Alaskan Salmon Roe and then you

141
00:06:34,581 --> 00:06:39,220
can buy it in bulk.
The company was called a vital choice is

142
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:44,260
nasty.
It tasted nasty during my first 

143
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:44,810
trimester.
I was like,

144
00:06:44,811 --> 00:06:45,920
Oh,
maybe I should wait.

145
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:50,060
But you know,
the texture a lot of people don't like,

146
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:55,210
like Dan doesn't like the texture 
because like the salmon roe is like 

147
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:58,270
bigger.
The fish eggs are bigger and so it can 

148
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:00,101
kind of pop in like you get like little 
fish to fish for trout really trout 

149
00:07:02,421 --> 00:07:07,421
would eat salmon roe.
So we would fish for trout using salmon 

150
00:07:07,421 --> 00:07:07,421
eggs.
Well,

151
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:10,420
I mean the salmon eggs are like quite a 
bit larger.

152
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:11,270
Yeah.
The credit larger,

153
00:07:11,271 --> 00:07:16,271
there's other ones like I think it's the
flying fish that are really small in the

154
00:07:16,731 --> 00:07:21,731
Fascial Epa,
Dha and foster the bid form varies from 

155
00:07:21,731 --> 00:07:21,731
species,
you know,

156
00:07:21,731 --> 00:07:22,310
different types of fish and things like 
that.

157
00:07:22,311 --> 00:07:24,830
But generally speaking they're,
you know,

158
00:07:24,831 --> 00:07:29,831
it's,
it's a good thing to eat and especially 

159
00:07:29,831 --> 00:07:30,350
during pregnancy.
So how did you consume it on Avocados?

160
00:07:30,351 --> 00:07:33,010
I put it on top of Bob Ocado is with 
some lemon juice and like,

161
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:33,990
like hot sauce.

162
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:38,060
So just kind of like a Paleo training.
Yeah,

163
00:07:38,061 --> 00:07:40,870
it was like a lot of fat.
So avocados have potassium,

164
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:43,670
low,
mono unsaturated fat and vitamin E,

165
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:45,060
all the different forms,
you know.

166
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:50,070
So Avocados,
a mono unsaturated fat and saturated 

167
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:50,070
fat,
right.

168
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:50,300
They have a small amount of saturated 
fat.

169
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:51,510
Probably a small amount.
Yeah.

170
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,710
When I say they have,
like,

171
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:56,380
typically when I talk about foods,
um,

172
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,610
I'll talk about what's,
you know,

173
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:03,670
what's concentrated,
so it's like really concentrated in 

174
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:04,950
Mahnomen saturated fat.
So whereas like if you say,

175
00:08:04,951 --> 00:08:09,951
you know,
butter or cheese and it's concentrated 

176
00:08:09,951 --> 00:08:12,661
in saturated fat,
but typically you'll find mono poly and 

177
00:08:12,661 --> 00:08:14,420
saturated fat in all different forms of 
fat.

178
00:08:14,421 --> 00:08:16,640
It just very varying amounts.
Right.

179
00:08:16,641 --> 00:08:19,040
And to some degree it's like,
well it's not even really significant.

180
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:24,041
It's such a small amount.
I don't know how much of the Salmon Roe 

181
00:08:24,041 --> 00:08:24,041
were you consuming?

182
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:29,470
It really depends.
Like I started to really start to ramp 

183
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:32,920
up my consumption.
I'm in the third trimester when brain 

184
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:36,670
development and just like really getting
crazy thinking about this every day.

185
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:41,600
So every day I was putting a big old 
tablespoon full on top of my avocado.

186
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:46,960
A really third trimester was like,
I was like almost everyday trying to 

187
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:47,830
consume it,
but it was hard for me.

188
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:52,850
The first trimester I was,
I started to try a little bit and it 

189
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:56,621
made me a little nauseous.
Like I know if your kid can read minds 

190
00:08:56,621 --> 00:08:57,180
when it,
it comes out and he's like super brain.

191
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:01,140
Everyone probably is super biased about 
their own children,

192
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:06,360
but I'm like,
he's got great verbal skills and him 

193
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,110
super smart.
You're super smart.

194
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:09,300
Like this,
and you're eating all these fish,

195
00:09:09,301 --> 00:09:10,860
eggs,
kids.

196
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:12,040
This kid said,
oh,

197
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:13,320
thank you.
It'll be interesting.

198
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:14,880
It can.
We can talk to him.

199
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:18,060
He's going to be forced sitting right 
there.

200
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:22,290
What's funny is he was like early on 
when he was six weeks old,

201
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,930
he was,
he went through a really short stage of.

202
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:28,410
He was making sounds that sounded like 
hello.

203
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:31,410
And so my mom would come over and she 
would in his face,

204
00:09:31,411 --> 00:09:32,670
she would go,
hello,

205
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:34,380
hello.
And he would.

206
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:36,300
And we have a video of it,
like I could send it to you,

207
00:09:36,301 --> 00:09:41,301
I'll send it to you.
He would go and it like literally seems 

208
00:09:41,301 --> 00:09:41,880
like he's saying it,
but clearly he's not.

209
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:43,200
I mean he's six weeks old,
you know?

210
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:48,410
But he was able to sort of mimic the 
sound because I think it was easier for 

211
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:50,250
him since he was already sort of making 
those sounds.

212
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:53,070
So of course Dan and Ryan and Dan and I 
were super pumped.

213
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:54,390
We're like,
he's gonna be a genius.

214
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:57,570
We're sending the video to other family 
members.

215
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,780
You should really listen to what we say.
See,

216
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:00,540
oh,
that's,

217
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:03,540
of course you know,
he's not really saying hello,

218
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:05,730
but making noises,
he's making noises.

219
00:10:05,731 --> 00:10:10,731
It sounds like it.
And it was totally coincidental but was 

220
00:10:10,731 --> 00:10:13,540
just the difference between like a kid 
making a noise and a kid knowing what 

221
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:15,060
the noise means.
Like when they're actually talking to my

222
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:16,830
mom,
my seven year old,

223
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:22,300
the seven year old,
she didn't really start talking in full 

224
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:23,010
sentences until she was like a year and 
a half,

225
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:26,070
but my,
my nine year old,

226
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,800
like when she was like nine,
10 months old,

227
00:10:28,801 --> 00:10:30,600
she was talking.
It was weird.

228
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:34,200
It's like she's really smart.
Like she was talking like right away,

229
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:36,600
like,
and she was stood up quicker too.

230
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:41,780
She,
she was standing at like nine months 

231
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:41,780
old,
which I found pretty shocking,

232
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:43,660
like an unassisted standing.

233
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:46,470
That's when she wanted to stand in nine 
months old.

234
00:10:46,471 --> 00:10:50,130
She was getting her stand on and I'm 
trying to take some steps and I was like

235
00:10:50,131 --> 00:10:51,930
this crazy,
like she's just,

236
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:57,360
she's like,
that's how she is as a little person 

237
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:57,360
too.
She's a little go getter.

238
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:58,860
I often wonder,
you know,

239
00:10:58,861 --> 00:11:02,820
that the earlier the first borns and the
ones that are born earlier,

240
00:11:02,821 --> 00:11:06,330
like if they get more attention to,
because it's novel here,

241
00:11:06,331 --> 00:11:09,390
they're first time parents and then as 
more children come,

242
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:11,150
you know,
it's like you're just,

243
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:14,460
you're,
you're spread a little more thin and you

244
00:11:14,461 --> 00:11:14,990
know,
I mean,

245
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:20,480
it's not necessarily the case,
but it's certainly something I've often 

246
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:20,520
wondered,
you know,

247
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:22,070
if,
if we,

248
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:24,780
if I want to have another child,
will I be able to do it,

249
00:11:24,781 --> 00:11:26,830
you know,
it's because I really just wanted.

250
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:29,550
There's so much work that goes into not 
just,

251
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,260
you know,
the nutrition part.

252
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:33,150
And I was talking about,
you asked me about,

253
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:38,151
you know,
things during pregnancy and something I 

254
00:11:38,151 --> 00:11:38,760
think people don't realize is that,
you know,

255
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,670
epigenetics,
which is basically the transference of,

256
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:42,720
um,
it's,

257
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:47,950
it's heritable.
Like you can transfer things that 

258
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:51,141
happened to you in your lifestyle 
without actually altering the sequence 

259
00:11:51,141 --> 00:11:52,670
of DNA.
And you can do that by changing how much

260
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:56,020
gene is activated or not activated.
And there's been studies,

261
00:11:56,021 --> 00:11:59,110
lots and lots of stomach studies in 
animals showing this to be the case.

262
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:04,410
Of course,
that's animals and how much of that 

263
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:04,610
actually translates to humans,
but there was a really interesting study

264
00:12:04,611 --> 00:12:09,611
a couple of years ago,
I think it was late 2015 that was 

265
00:12:09,611 --> 00:12:13,111
published that looked at the effect of 
obesity and obesity was actually looked 

266
00:12:13,151 --> 00:12:15,360
at,
not in the mothers but the fathers.

267
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:20,350
Um,
and so a sperm DNA was collected from,

268
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:25,590
for males that were obese and males that
were lean and that there's a variety of 

269
00:12:26,171 --> 00:12:31,171
different genes like hundreds of 
different genes that were looked at and 

270
00:12:31,171 --> 00:12:34,050
about 300 different genes were different
in how they were activated or not 

271
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:35,890
activated in the sperm Dna of the obese 
men.

272
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,710
And a lot of those genes had to do with 
cognition,

273
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:40,570
learning,
memory and metabolism.

274
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:46,050
So that's very interesting.
But what was super interesting was that 

275
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:46,780
these men,
they were morbidly obese or obese.

276
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:51,730
They underwent bariatric surgery and 
their sperm DNA was collected,

277
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:52,540
uh,
you know,

278
00:12:52,541 --> 00:12:54,850
a couple of months after then,
like close to a year after.

279
00:12:55,240 --> 00:13:00,240
And as time went on,
their sperm DNA looked like the lean 

280
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:01,060
people.
So the,

281
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:04,540
so basically losing the weight,
just losing the weight.

282
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:08,830
Had an effect on these genes that are 
involved in cognition and metabolism.

283
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:10,270
Like I said,
you know,

284
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:14,940
lots of animal studies have shown 
obesity has a negative effect on like,

285
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:20,750
you know,
causing type one diabetes later in life 

286
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:22,240
and different cognitive disabilities and
things like that.

287
00:13:22,241 --> 00:13:27,241
So you know,
it is something like people that are 

288
00:13:27,241 --> 00:13:28,060
wanting to conceive my might consider,
you know,

289
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:32,500
their,
their health before trying to procreate.

290
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:33,390
You know,
it's,

291
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:34,840
it's,
I'm not saying that,

292
00:13:34,841 --> 00:13:39,841
you know,
you shouldn't procreate if you're not 

293
00:13:39,841 --> 00:13:39,841
healthy,
but it's just something,

294
00:13:39,841 --> 00:13:43,770
you know,
another thing to think about and also I 

295
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:45,931
think it's a motivating factor for 
people because sometimes you don't care 

296
00:13:45,931 --> 00:13:45,970
as much about yourself.
I mean some people don't,

297
00:13:45,971 --> 00:13:49,360
they're just kinda like,
but their child or their unborn child,

298
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,760
that's probably,
you know,

299
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:56,390
a driver for,
for people to make a change like that 

300
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:56,390
would certainly hope it would be.
I mean,

301
00:13:56,390 --> 00:14:00,871
you have this opportunity to really 
literally changed the way your child 

302
00:14:00,871 --> 00:14:01,630
develops.
And it's just by your discipline,

303
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:06,740
right?
Just by whether or not you're taking 

304
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:08,701
care of your own body,
you can literally change the future of 

305
00:14:08,701 --> 00:14:11,071
your trial because you're saying that 
these genes that are in this obese man 

306
00:14:11,071 --> 00:14:12,520
sperm,
the way they're represented that's going

307
00:14:12,521 --> 00:14:17,521
to be passed onto the kid versus the 
lean version of him pass those genes.

308
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:22,890
We've passed on to the kid.
The kid literally will have a different 

309
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:22,890
starting point.
Exactly.

310
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:24,550
Different starting point.
It's totally crazy.

311
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:25,630
Yeah.
I mean,

312
00:14:25,631 --> 00:14:30,190
of course the child itself can change 
things through epigenetics,

313
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:34,060
through their diet and lifestyle,
but you're giving them a baseline here,

314
00:14:34,061 --> 00:14:34,690
right?
I mean,

315
00:14:34,691 --> 00:14:36,370
so it's,
it's,

316
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:39,580
it's definitely a very,
it's a growing field.

317
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:44,260
A lot of the research has done in 
animals because it's really difficult to

318
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,750
do that sort of,
these sorts of experiments in humans.

319
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:52,020
But I think that this is sort of a proof
of principle at the very least looking 

320
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:52,880
at sperm DNA.
Um,

321
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,760
you know,
so it,

322
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,600
it's,
it's something to consider.

323
00:14:56,601 --> 00:14:59,870
And I've had like,
like friends of friends that have,

324
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:00,650
you know,
that are,

325
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:04,250
that are overweight or obese and wanting
to have children.

326
00:15:04,251 --> 00:15:06,620
And so it's like,
I tried to talk to them about that in a,

327
00:15:06,621 --> 00:15:09,380
in a way that's not like condescending,
you know,

328
00:15:09,381 --> 00:15:11,300
some people,
some people do have a hard time,

329
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:13,670
they're trying to lose weight and you 
know,

330
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:18,680
this,
they have to find the right combination 

331
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:18,680
of things that works for them.

332
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:18,680
But,
um,

333
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,870
but I do think that people would get 
more motivated if they're like,

334
00:15:20,871 --> 00:15:21,680
wow,
I can,

335
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:24,530
you know,
affect my future child risk for type one

336
00:15:24,531 --> 00:15:26,540
diabetes or for,
you know,

337
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:31,630
like how well what their Iq is,
how well they're performing on learning 

338
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:33,920
and memory test.
So it also avoid the horrific guilt that

339
00:15:33,921 --> 00:15:38,921
you would feel if you didn't do that.
And you started to see these things 

340
00:15:38,921 --> 00:15:40,170
manifesting in your child when you 
realize,

341
00:15:40,171 --> 00:15:45,171
oh my God,
I sent this kid up in a shitty way 

342
00:15:45,171 --> 00:15:47,291
because I'm lazy.
Which is essentially what a lot of the 

343
00:15:47,291 --> 00:15:48,220
problem is with people.
It's just that they don't have what,

344
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,640
whatever.
The mental,

345
00:15:49,641 --> 00:15:54,641
you know,
and people get angry if you say that 

346
00:15:54,641 --> 00:15:54,641
either they're lazy because they don't 
die it for.

347
00:15:54,641 --> 00:15:55,790
Forget that word.
Forget to take away the word Lazy.

348
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:59,720
You're unmotivated will say that,
but for whatever reason,

349
00:15:59,721 --> 00:16:04,721
if you choose not to take care of your 
health and you see that transfer into 

350
00:16:05,001 --> 00:16:07,670
your child and you know that you're 
unhappy with your existence,

351
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:12,760
you know you're unhappy with your 
physical body and you refuse to do or 

352
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:17,200
for whatever reason don't do enough,
and then you see these same problems 

353
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,540
manifesting in your own baby and you 
realize like,

354
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:20,720
oh my God,
I started this kid off in a shitty way.

355
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:22,610
Like you're going to be riddled with 
guilt.

356
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:23,810
Totally.
I mean,

357
00:16:23,811 --> 00:16:28,811
the thing is most people don't know 
about avid genetics and they don't 

358
00:16:28,811 --> 00:16:28,811
really know that they're,
that they're able to do that.

359
00:16:28,811 --> 00:16:31,460
So the more.
The more people are educated,

360
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:34,730
I think the better the outcome will be.
But like you said,

361
00:16:34,731 --> 00:16:36,620
the people that do now and then still do
it,

362
00:16:36,621 --> 00:16:37,400
it's like,
yeah,

363
00:16:37,401 --> 00:16:39,770
the guilt.
I mean that's like unbelievable.

364
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:44,800
Well,
it's like people who smoke when they 

365
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:44,800
have a kid,
you know,

366
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:44,800
that's,
that's so insane.

367
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,010
You see people that are pregnant,
smoking.

368
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:48,740
I was in,
I forget what state it was in,

369
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:54,070
but we were outside this convenience 
store and there was a lady who was 

370
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:54,860
clearly pregnant and she clearly was 
smoking cigarettes and I was like,

371
00:16:54,861 --> 00:16:57,680
fuck man,
that's just gross Canada.

372
00:16:57,890 --> 00:16:59,540
It was like,
this hurts my feelings.

373
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:01,460
Just watching.
That just hurts my feelings.

374
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:02,720
It doesn't,
it just make you sick.

375
00:17:02,721 --> 00:17:03,350
Yeah.
That's like,

376
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:09,010
you know,
and there's all sorts of studies that 

377
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:09,010
have shown,
you know,

378
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:12,611
of course smoking during pregnancy 
causes or not causes associated with 

379
00:17:12,611 --> 00:17:15,080
like Adhd and um,
uh,

380
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:18,390
what's it called?
Like the movement,

381
00:17:18,391 --> 00:17:20,420
just like a,
like a dyskinesia thing,

382
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:21,800
you know,
all sorts of problems.

383
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:26,860
So it's certainly like I having the 
knowledge and continuing to read 

384
00:17:27,201 --> 00:17:28,370
throughout pregnancy.
Then once,

385
00:17:28,371 --> 00:17:29,810
you know,
having the baby,

386
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:32,030
like one thing that I knew that I 
really,

387
00:17:32,031 --> 00:17:34,130
really wanted to do was I wanted to 
breastfeed.

388
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:35,810
Like that was,
you know,

389
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:41,290
like they're,
the benefits of breastfeeding are just 

390
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:42,320
amazing and this is something that like 
my,

391
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:46,460
like my stepmother for example,
her generation also my,

392
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:49,340
my grandmother,
they didn't know about like,

393
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:49,980
so they weren't

394
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:52,260
recommended to breastfeed.
You know,

395
00:17:52,261 --> 00:17:55,140
back in like the fifties,
like it just wasn't,

396
00:17:55,141 --> 00:17:57,300
you know,
the benefits weren't known,

397
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:01,950
but now we know like breastfeeding,
it's kind of amazing.

398
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:07,460
There are something,
there's something in breast milk called 

399
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:07,860
human milk oligosaccharides.
Have you heard of these?

400
00:18:07,861 --> 00:18:12,861
Hmo.
There's like 200 different of oligos 

401
00:18:12,861 --> 00:18:13,860
human milk oligosaccharides in breast 
milk.

402
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:18,920
In fact,
it's like the third most common factor 

403
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:22,011
in breast milk behind lactose and fat,
200 different ones and they cannot be 

404
00:18:22,021 --> 00:18:26,130
digested at all by like the infants.
I'm digestive system.

405
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:31,640
It's like they co evolved specifically 
to feed the microbiome in the gut of 

406
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:36,800
these infants and they're in there 
specifically increasing the species of 

407
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:40,401
bacteria.
I'm bifidobacteria in fantasy is one 

408
00:18:40,401 --> 00:18:40,401
really,
really important one,

409
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:42,630
but it's,
it's amazing that they're,

410
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:47,780
it's really,
that's the only purpose that they serve 

411
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:50,540
is to feed and you know,
basically populate the infant gut with 

412
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:55,011
this beneficial bacteria and you know,
this bacteria has been shown to one 

413
00:18:55,011 --> 00:18:59,570
setup the immune system because they 
digest these oligosaccharides and they 

414
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:03,801
produce other molecules called short 
chain fatty acids and those short chain 

415
00:19:03,801 --> 00:19:04,830
fatty acids like lactate,
butyrate,

416
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:08,670
Acetate,
things that you've heard of those act as

417
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:13,671
what are called signaling molecules to 
basically determine what kind of immune 

418
00:19:13,671 --> 00:19:13,860
cells you're going to make.

419
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:17,970
So a big one that they do is they make a
t regulatory cells,

420
00:19:17,971 --> 00:19:20,280
which are kind of immune cells that 
prevents autoimmunity,

421
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:23,010
autoimmune responses.
So like children that are not,

422
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,390
um,
that,

423
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:29,480
that are not breastfed,
they lack like four different species 

424
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:29,480
of,
um,

425
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:34,800
of,
of gut bacteria and they have like a 

426
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,681
three,
three fold increased risk of allergies 

427
00:19:36,681 --> 00:19:36,681
and um,
you know,

428
00:19:36,681 --> 00:19:37,370
autoimmune related diseases.
So it's like,

429
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:40,290
it's doing that.
And also it's like preventing pathogenic

430
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:43,080
bacteria from,
from like taking residents there.

431
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:48,490
Um,
because these human milk 

432
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:48,490
oligosaccharides,
not only are they feeding the beneficial

433
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:53,181
bacteria will recently,
it's been found that they like break 

434
00:19:53,181 --> 00:19:55,200
down biofilms that bacteria create to 
like,

435
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:58,920
you know,
basically escape antimicrobial activity.

436
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:02,310
So there's a lot of antimicrobial things
in breast milk like lauric acid,

437
00:20:02,311 --> 00:20:04,680
which is also found in coconut oil.
Um,

438
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:09,710
but the,
the human milk oligosaccharides 

439
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:10,140
basically break down the biofilm so that
the lord acid can work better.

440
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:11,790
So it's like,
you know,

441
00:20:11,791 --> 00:20:14,430
and their stem cells,
there are stem cells in breast milk,

442
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:16,120
mammary stem cells.
Like,

443
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:21,140
that blew my mind.
I think it's been like 10 years since 

444
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:22,320
the discovery of that.
But like it's been.

445
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:25,890
So it's that the studies have been 
mostly done in mice,

446
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:30,690
but they have measured.
Humans have the same memory type of stem

447
00:20:30,691 --> 00:20:34,020
cells in their breast milk.
But in animals and preclinical studies,

448
00:20:34,021 --> 00:20:35,350
it's been shown that those,
that,

449
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:37,890
those breast stem cells,
they get digested.

450
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:40,650
They go into the bloodstream and they go
to various organs.

451
00:20:40,651 --> 00:20:41,890
They go to the kidney,
the liver,

452
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,020
the brain,
and they start to,

453
00:20:43,021 --> 00:20:48,021
like in the pancreas,
they start to make like insulin 

454
00:20:48,021 --> 00:20:48,021
producing cells.
Like,

455
00:20:48,021 --> 00:20:48,021
it's crazy.
Wow.

456
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:50,290
So that's amazing.
That's only 10 years ago.

457
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:51,640
They didn't notice.
Yeah,

458
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:52,170
I know.

459
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:57,270
It's all happening so fast when it comes
to knowledge of nutrition and the effect

460
00:20:57,461 --> 00:20:58,400
on the body and especially

461
00:20:58,450 --> 00:20:59,740
developing children.
Well,

462
00:20:59,741 --> 00:21:04,210
the breast milk thing is really what's 
interesting because once I like,

463
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:09,830
you know,
I had my son and you immediately start 

464
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:09,830
breastfeeding.
Like I had no idea it was going to be so

465
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:11,500
difficult.
Like I thought it was just,

466
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,330
and maybe it's not difficult for 
everyone,

467
00:21:13,331 --> 00:21:18,331
but I think it's difficult for a lot of 
women and a lot of women give up after 

468
00:21:18,331 --> 00:21:22,111
like the first two weeks they give up 
because you know that it's just for 

469
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:24,050
various reasons.
It gets,

470
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:26,350
it can be extremely frustrated.
You're a new parent,

471
00:21:26,351 --> 00:21:29,360
you're getting no sleep and you know,
so um,

472
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:34,770
like I,
my son had a little bit of a tongue 

473
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:34,770
time,
right?

474
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:37,950
Like the little thing on underneath his 
tongue kind of prevented a tongue from 

475
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:41,470
moving like as much as it's supposed to.
So like he,

476
00:21:41,471 --> 00:21:43,060
when he opened his mouth and he'd latch 
on,

477
00:21:43,061 --> 00:21:44,380
there was a little bit of problem.

478
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,630
So the first two weeks were really hard 
for me,

479
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:51,010
but that sort of resolved,
but I really had to try like my,

480
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:52,750
like Dan and I were,
were taking,

481
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:57,780
I was pumping some,
some milk and we are putting it in a 

482
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:57,880
syringe with a little tube and like 
putting them on the breast,

483
00:21:57,881 --> 00:22:02,881
you know,
because I didn't want to introduce the 

484
00:22:02,881 --> 00:22:02,881
bottle so early.
So I mean,

485
00:22:02,881 --> 00:22:03,100
and that was hard.
I mean,

486
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:08,110
I was getting no sleep.
I could totally see if you didn't know 

487
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:09,820
all the benefits of breastfeeding that I
could,

488
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:14,880
I could see how new mothers would,
would give up because it's extremely 

489
00:22:15,491 --> 00:22:16,870
difficult.
So,

490
00:22:16,871 --> 00:22:21,871
um,
that's something that I completely 

491
00:22:21,871 --> 00:22:21,871
understand.
I understand now.

492
00:22:21,871 --> 00:22:24,340
I think previously I was like,
how can anyone not press feed,

493
00:22:24,341 --> 00:22:24,910
you know,
it's so,

494
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,260
but it,
it really,

495
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,990
it's not easy for everyone.
There's all sorts of problems that women

496
00:22:28,991 --> 00:22:31,930
have,
but there are actually breast milk banks

497
00:22:31,931 --> 00:22:36,931
that like,
so women can donate their breast milk 

498
00:22:36,931 --> 00:22:36,931
and um,
people,

499
00:22:36,931 --> 00:22:37,240
you know,
can,

500
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:40,060
can buy the breast milk instead of 
getting formula.

501
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:41,830
Now of course there's all sorts of other
problems.

502
00:22:41,831 --> 00:22:42,310
It's like,
wow,

503
00:22:42,311 --> 00:22:47,311
they're getting enough vitamin D and 
Omega three and what else are they 

504
00:22:47,311 --> 00:22:47,540
taking?
You know,

505
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:53,060
you,
there's so many different things that 

506
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:53,060
happen once you have children,
breast milk,

507
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:54,810
being a breastfeeding,
I'm sure being one of them,

508
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:59,840
but the lack of sleep thing,
which I think most people just really 

509
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,150
don't,
don't have any idea like what,

510
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:05,170
what is happening and that they also 
don't understand how difficult it is to 

511
00:23:05,170 --> 00:23:06,630
watch a child.
And right now it's difficult.

512
00:23:06,631 --> 00:23:11,631
Wait until the kid starts walking.
They start walking around and you have 

513
00:23:11,631 --> 00:23:14,811
to follow them around.
You're literally like walking around 

514
00:23:14,811 --> 00:23:14,811
with them everywhere they go.
I got,

515
00:23:14,811 --> 00:23:18,560
don't put that in your mouth.
Don't touch that lick that you'll get 

516
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,230
electrocuted until it's like everywhere 
you go,

517
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,640
it's,
it's such a,

518
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:23,850
I don't want to say a project,
it's,

519
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:24,420
it's,
um,

520
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:28,950
it's just way more difficult in 
consuming then.

521
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:34,000
And also your protective instincts are 
ramped up so high.

522
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:40,190
Like my friend Eddie had a cats and 
rabbits and he's talking about how much 

523
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:42,150
he loves his rabbits and he's like,
dude,

524
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:47,210
just wait until you have your kid.
You're going to want to kill fucking 

525
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:47,450
rabbits.
He's like,

526
00:23:47,451 --> 00:23:48,260
no way,
man.

527
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:50,030
I love the cats.
I love the rabbits.

528
00:23:50,031 --> 00:23:51,140
And as soon as he had the kid,
he's like,

529
00:23:51,141 --> 00:23:52,820
fuck you,
right cats.

530
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,020
He goes,
my cat wakes up,

531
00:23:54,021 --> 00:23:55,350
my kid.
I want to kill this fucking cat.

532
00:23:57,740 --> 00:24:02,740
It's true.
Your protective mechanisms I know 

533
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:03,020
changes you.
It changes you so much and you know,

534
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:06,170
people that don't have children and who 
complained about kids that are crying.

535
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:11,560
I used to,
used to bother me if I was on a plane 

536
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:11,560
and babies are crying,
you know,

537
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:13,250
I used to be like,
aww baby won't shut up.

538
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:14,840
But now I'm like,
Oh,

539
00:24:14,850 --> 00:24:18,050
poor little baby.
Like literally it doesn't bother me.

540
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:20,150
Like,
like someone could be a break right next

541
00:24:20,151 --> 00:24:22,670
to me with a crying baby and I feel bad 
for the baby.

542
00:24:22,671 --> 00:24:23,780
It doesn't bother me.
Like,

543
00:24:23,781 --> 00:24:25,190
damn,
his baby won't shut up.

544
00:24:25,490 --> 00:24:26,310
It's like a different.

545
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,910
Totally.
I,

546
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,260
I've started to experience that to some 
degree in,

547
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,760
in various ways as well where it's like 
you just,

548
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:34,240
Oh,
the poor baby.

549
00:24:34,241 --> 00:24:35,850
You become a different person.
Yeah.

550
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:37,380
You do.
You relate to it.

551
00:24:37,381 --> 00:24:37,980
It's amazing.

552
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:38,670
Yeah,
it's,

553
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,080
it's,
it's the best thing ever.

554
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:40,650
Wow.
I mean,

555
00:24:40,651 --> 00:24:42,450
it creates so much empathy.
I mean,

556
00:24:42,451 --> 00:24:45,690
it just changed my whole perspective of 
what a person is,

557
00:24:45,691 --> 00:24:46,850
is different.
Uh,

558
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:51,860
my,
my idea of a person used to be a static 

559
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:51,990
form like Jamie's 35,
35,

560
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:54,330
34.
Like I would say,

561
00:24:54,331 --> 00:24:56,010
God,
that's 34 year old Jamie.

562
00:24:56,011 --> 00:24:57,330
That's who he is.
I never thought,

563
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,710
oh,
Jamie was a baby.

564
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:01,890
Like Jamie used to be a four year old.
Like Jamie went to preschool.

565
00:25:01,891 --> 00:25:04,710
Jamie went to kindergarten there.
I never thought about it that way.

566
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:05,430
I'd be like,
oh,

567
00:25:05,431 --> 00:25:06,180
there's Jamie.
Hey,

568
00:25:06,181 --> 00:25:07,980
what's up Jamie?
Jamie's always been Jamie.

569
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:13,190
You know,
that's like how I used to look at 

570
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:14,871
people.
Now we're looking at everybody as a 

571
00:25:14,871 --> 00:25:14,871
baby.
I called,

572
00:25:14,871 --> 00:25:17,070
that's a baby that became a grown man.
Like that's how I look at everyone now.

573
00:25:17,071 --> 00:25:17,820
It's so,
it's,

574
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:22,860
it's weird.
It's like a paradigm shift happened in 

575
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:22,860
my brain.
That is,

576
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:23,730
that's,
that's definitely weird.

577
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:25,890
It made me way more compassionate.
Way,

578
00:25:25,891 --> 00:25:28,410
way nicer to people,
which is way I just,

579
00:25:28,411 --> 00:25:31,830
I think I don't want anybody's life to 
fall apart anymore.

580
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:32,830
I used to like,
quieter.

581
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:34,620
I hope that guy gets hit by a truck,
you know?

582
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:35,940
Now I'm like,
man,

583
00:25:35,941 --> 00:25:38,400
I hope that little baby figures out why 
he's such an asshole.

584
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:44,600
Interesting to kind of see the brain 
activation pathways that change.

585
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:45,880
Like,
you know,

586
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,840
if you're talking about being more 
compassionate,

587
00:25:47,841 --> 00:25:52,841
that's almost like,
I mean there's a certain type of 

588
00:25:52,841 --> 00:25:56,531
meditation,
like the compassion meditation that 

589
00:25:56,531 --> 00:25:56,531
people do that changes like certain 
parts of the brain.

590
00:25:56,531 --> 00:26:01,240
It kind of interesting to see my,
like Dan thinks that I've gotten more 

591
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,600
creative because I make up all these 
like mommy games and mommy songs.

592
00:26:02,601 --> 00:26:06,290
Just like I never was really a super,
super creative person.

593
00:26:06,291 --> 00:26:08,190
I'm more analytical,
you know,

594
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:09,800
I've got,
I definitely have some creativity,

595
00:26:09,801 --> 00:26:11,930
but like he,
he's kind of like,

596
00:26:11,931 --> 00:26:16,931
I wonder if just like becoming a mommy,
like you just all of a sudden become 

597
00:26:16,931 --> 00:26:16,931
more creative,
you know?

598
00:26:16,931 --> 00:26:17,150
I don't know.

599
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:19,120
I'm sure there's a bunch of stuff going 
on.

600
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:21,190
I mean,
your brain just gets activated.

601
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:26,520
It.
I do stuff with my seven year old 

602
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:26,650
sometimes and half the time we're doing 
stuff I'm like,

603
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:31,680
I can't even believe you're real.
Like I'm having these little 

604
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,040
conversations with her were playing 
little games and you know,

605
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:35,650
like we play this really stupid game.
It's so dumb.

606
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:40,670
So you spin this thing and it's like,
it corresponds to a different color 

607
00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:43,650
acorns and you know,
and when she wins and she jumps up,

608
00:26:43,651 --> 00:26:43,920
she like,

609
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:48,980
oh I beat you.
And she's like doing her little dance 

610
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:49,950
and she's like throwing her arms in the.
And I'm like,

611
00:26:49,951 --> 00:26:52,710
this is like half of me is laughing 
because she's funny,

612
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:57,860
but half of me is going,
this is so strange that you're a little 

613
00:26:57,860 --> 00:26:58,120
person that I'm talking to.
Like you,

614
00:26:58,121 --> 00:27:03,121
you were a baby and now you're this 
little seven year old playing this game 

615
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:03,121
with me.
It's like,

616
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:05,730
it's so odd.
I feel that way with my four month old.

617
00:27:05,731 --> 00:27:08,700
I see little personality things already 
kind of creeping up and it's like,

618
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:14,450
that's amazing.
So I can only imagine like as he 

619
00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:14,940
continues to develop and that's why it's
very.

620
00:27:14,941 --> 00:27:19,941
I think it's very difficult for people 
that don't have children to sort of 

621
00:27:19,941 --> 00:27:21,090
develop that same level of 
compassionate.

622
00:27:21,091 --> 00:27:23,100
It sounds like a cop out.
It sounds like it sounds weird,

623
00:27:23,101 --> 00:27:24,060
but I really do.

624
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:29,060
I think there's something,
there's actually something to be gained 

625
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:31,500
and as far as like everyone reproducing.
Well obviously we have too many people,

626
00:27:31,501 --> 00:27:33,270
so that's not.
I don't know if that's the best thing.

627
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:37,230
I certainly think that you could be a 
fully formed,

628
00:27:37,231 --> 00:27:42,231
healthy,
wonderful person who contributes an 

629
00:27:42,231 --> 00:27:42,480
amazing thing to the world if you don't 
have children.

630
00:27:42,481 --> 00:27:45,510
I don't think you have to have children,
but I think for me it was,

631
00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:47,400
it was very much.
There was a,

632
00:27:47,401 --> 00:27:51,250
there was a giant learning experience 
along with it.

633
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:54,600
There's a giant evolving experience 
along with just being a parent.

634
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,220
It was,
something happened to me.

635
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:57,780
It's,
it's,

636
00:27:57,781 --> 00:27:59,820
it's absolutely life changing,
you know?

637
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:01,730
Um,
it's,

638
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:02,880
I,
I had no idea.

639
00:28:02,881 --> 00:28:05,190
Like I've always heard people say that 
the best thing that happened to me,

640
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:07,980
it truly is.
It truly is the best thing.

641
00:28:07,981 --> 00:28:09,040
And,
uh,

642
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:10,470
so,
you know,

643
00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:11,260
I'm,
I'm,

644
00:28:11,610 --> 00:28:15,330
I'm excited to,
to continue to see how it changes me and

645
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:20,600
it just unfortunately corresponds with a
lot of financial stress with a lot of 

646
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:20,600
people,
time,

647
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:20,750
stress,
financial stress,

648
00:28:20,751 --> 00:28:23,550
last lack of sleep and sometimes they 
just don't appreciate it,

649
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:26,460
you know,
just you're so overwhelmed by the burden

650
00:28:26,461 --> 00:28:30,510
of just trying to get by that sometimes 
you can't appreciate this amazing moment

651
00:28:30,511 --> 00:28:32,580
that happened in front of you and it's,
you know,

652
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,140
it's hard,
it's hard to,

653
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:37,050
it's hard to have a good perspective and
it's hard.

654
00:28:37,410 --> 00:28:40,980
It's hard to like be able to see things 
from above,

655
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,860
like to sort of rise above and look at 
the big picture of this thing.

656
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:45,800
And that's,
for me,

657
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,190
something that really helps with that 
is,

658
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:48,870
is exercise.
Sure.

659
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:51,210
I think that also,
you know,

660
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:55,980
I didn't have any postpartum depression,
at least I think I didn't.

661
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:59,700
I mean I think there's a variety of 
factors.

662
00:28:59,701 --> 00:29:00,930
I mean,
so for one,

663
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:02,370
you know,
your,

664
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:04,800
um,
during pregnancy,

665
00:29:04,801 --> 00:29:06,450
your estrogen levels,
like they,

666
00:29:06,451 --> 00:29:11,451
like they go through the roof.
I mean it's like 100 fold higher and 

667
00:29:11,451 --> 00:29:15,790
undertold something like that.
Like it's really high compared to your 

668
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:17,370
baseline,
and don't quote me,

669
00:29:17,371 --> 00:29:19,410
I'm going to be something I'm thinking 
something like that,

670
00:29:19,411 --> 00:29:24,411
like I've just orders and orders of 
magnitude higher and estrogen and has 

671
00:29:24,411 --> 00:29:29,121
been shown to increase the expression of
a gene called Tryptophan hydroxylase to 

672
00:29:30,090 --> 00:29:32,880
in the brain that produces serotonin 
from tryptophan.

673
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:36,450
So you're constantly making serotonin 
constantly,

674
00:29:36,451 --> 00:29:37,200
constantly,
constantly.

675
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:38,400
And then,
you know,

676
00:29:38,401 --> 00:29:42,310
after you have the baby that goes away.
So it's Kinda like

677
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:48,390
a withdrawal.
So that's sort of one biochemical 

678
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:48,610
explanation.
But there are many others.

679
00:29:48,611 --> 00:29:50,830
One,
I think your circadian rhythm is off.

680
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:55,860
You're not,
you're not getting enough light because 

681
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:55,860
you're like nasty,
like you.

682
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:55,860
Like,
I don't think we left.

683
00:29:56,140 --> 00:30:01,140
I mean,
I don't even remember going outside for 

684
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:01,140
like two weeks maybe.
Yeah.

685
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:01,490
It was like,
you know,

686
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:03,700
especially with the difficult 
breastfeeding part.

687
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:08,760
So it was like you're constantly inside.
You're not getting that bright light 

688
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:09,490
exposure.
Your sleep is completely disrupted.

689
00:30:09,491 --> 00:30:11,440
So your circadian rhythm,
which is,

690
00:30:11,441 --> 00:30:12,820
you know,
extremely,

691
00:30:12,821 --> 00:30:15,340
extremely important for,
for mood,

692
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:17,740
for the way you feel,
uh,

693
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,630
that is completely disrupted because 
you're,

694
00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:20,620
you're waking up,
you know,

695
00:30:20,650 --> 00:30:24,160
multiple times a night and that's 
completely gone.

696
00:30:24,670 --> 00:30:26,830
Um,
and uh,

697
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:30,310
and it's stressful.
It's like completely new experience.

698
00:30:30,311 --> 00:30:33,250
You have this very fragile baby,
you know,

699
00:30:33,251 --> 00:30:38,251
that you're responsible for.
And so I think that combination of all 

700
00:30:38,251 --> 00:30:39,610
these things really can play a role in 
that.

701
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,440
Uh,
and for me,

702
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:46,480
I,
I really tried to make sure I was 

703
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,620
getting exercise as soon as I could,
you know,

704
00:30:47,621 --> 00:30:50,860
so that is something because exercise 
for a variety of reasons,

705
00:30:50,861 --> 00:30:55,861
one,
it's been shown to increase the 

706
00:30:55,861 --> 00:30:57,250
production of Serotonin by getting 
transport of Tryptophan into the brain.

707
00:30:57,670 --> 00:31:01,660
So branched chain amino acids which are 
found in a variety of,

708
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:03,370
of um,
proteins,

709
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:08,700
uh,
they can outcompete trip to fan and to 

710
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:08,700
get into the brain.
And so if you're not exercising,

711
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:11,410
you're constantly getting the branch 
chain amino acids in the brain which are

712
00:31:11,411 --> 00:31:14,470
serving other important roles,
but you're not getting that trip to fan.

713
00:31:14,471 --> 00:31:17,050
So you're not getting the precursor to 
make serotonin.

714
00:31:17,051 --> 00:31:20,080
And so the exercise alleviates that,
that competition,

715
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:23,080
branch chain amino acids get taken up 
into your muscle where they're,

716
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:28,110
you know,
they're used to help build muscle which 

717
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:28,110
is good.

718
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:28,110
And the Japan gets into the brain.
So you're making Serotonin,

719
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:29,200
that's one.
Two,

720
00:31:29,201 --> 00:31:30,290
you're making,
um,

721
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:31,660
you know,
endorphins,

722
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:34,960
a Beta endorphins help so that,
that's another thing.

723
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:36,980
And then the,
you're,

724
00:31:36,981 --> 00:31:41,981
you're increasing the production of new 
neurons through Serotonin also through 

725
00:31:41,981 --> 00:31:46,561
brain drive neurotrophic factor that 
also has been shown to help alleviate 

726
00:31:46,561 --> 00:31:47,710
depression and,
and prevent depression.

727
00:31:47,711 --> 00:31:52,711
The actual neurogenesis,
the thing that helps you to stave off 

728
00:31:52,711 --> 00:31:52,711
brain aging,
which by the way,

729
00:31:52,711 --> 00:31:57,691
there's been like,
there was like 14 clinical trials that 

730
00:31:57,691 --> 00:31:59,410
have been analyzed on looking at humans 
that,

731
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:04,500
that undergo like a real big exercise 
and how they have like their left part 

732
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:06,610
of their hippocampus doesn't like 
atrophy.

733
00:32:06,611 --> 00:32:08,680
Like people who do not exercise,
you know.

734
00:32:08,681 --> 00:32:10,660
So that's like because the neurogenesis,
but that,

735
00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:15,690
that's another reason you can visually 
see it atrophy you some sort of animal 

736
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:17,380
products.
Have you ever looked,

737
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:19,960
if you like google,
like Alzheimer's Disease Brain,

738
00:32:19,961 --> 00:32:24,961
like there's,
there's even images all over the place 

739
00:32:24,961 --> 00:32:27,421
where they show like before and after 
and there's just like big holes in the 

740
00:32:27,421 --> 00:32:27,421
brain.
I mean it's just like,

741
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:31,940
it's like because someone was comparing 
it to a football player was,

742
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:33,970
what's the guy's name who fell off the 
car?

743
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:36,910
The guy was Henry,
Chris and Chris Henry.

744
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,410
He was,
um,

745
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:40,100
I think he was only 28,

746
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:41,560
right?
Twenty six.

747
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:45,100
He was a young man who was an nfl 
football player.

748
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:48,680
No one had any idea he had cte.
This is like a earlier,

749
00:32:48,681 --> 00:32:50,540
understandably,
this is like seven years ago,

750
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:51,380
somewhere around there.
Right.

751
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:57,480
I'm much less understanding about the 
effects of cte and he had some sort of 

752
00:32:58,401 --> 00:33:01,250
an altercation with his girlfriend,
chased after her.

753
00:33:01,251 --> 00:33:06,251
She was,
she jumped in a car and he didn't want 

754
00:33:06,251 --> 00:33:08,561
her to leave.
So he jumped on top of the truck to try 

755
00:33:08,561 --> 00:33:09,290
to hang on and fell off the truck and 
killed himself.

756
00:33:09,810 --> 00:33:10,910
Um,
yeah.

757
00:33:11,210 --> 00:33:16,210
So they do an autopsy on him and they 
find out that he has a brain of a 70 

758
00:33:16,210 --> 00:33:18,020
year old man with Alzheimer's.
Well and he's 28,

759
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:20,210
26,
28,

760
00:33:20,211 --> 00:33:25,211
whatever it was.
He was young under 30 and super athlete 

761
00:33:25,211 --> 00:33:28,370
just and they were stunned and they 
looked at his brain and they're like,

762
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:29,610
well this is,
this is,

763
00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:34,710
this doesn't even make sense and now 
they're finding that this is the case 

764
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:34,710
with so many football players.

765
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:35,750
Just when you,
you,

766
00:33:35,751 --> 00:33:40,751
when you went to see the UFC,
when you and Dan with the see the UFC 

767
00:33:40,751 --> 00:33:45,640
and I talked to you afterwards,
we all went to dinner afterwards and 

768
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:48,071
you,
your eyes were as big as dinner plates 

769
00:33:48,071 --> 00:33:48,071
and you were like,
this is so bad.

770
00:33:48,071 --> 00:33:52,810
So many bad things are happening.
And then you started going into detail 

771
00:33:52,810 --> 00:33:54,380
about the various things that were 
happening.

772
00:33:54,381 --> 00:33:58,880
It was so fascinating to watch you a 
scientist.

773
00:33:58,881 --> 00:34:03,560
Watch people get head kicked and punched
in the face and watch.

774
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:05,420
Watch mma take place.
Yeah,

775
00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:10,450
I mean it's,
it's kind of crazy to think about how 

776
00:34:10,450 --> 00:34:12,170
people will like as a profession go and 
get,

777
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:17,260
like they're getting Tbi,
like constantly getting their head and 

778
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:17,260
you know,
there,

779
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:21,980
there are,
there's definitely like if you look at 

780
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:21,980
the non,
you know,

781
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:23,630
fighting forms,
martial arts where there like it,

782
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:26,930
it seems a lot more beautiful like cool 
moves and stuff,

783
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:28,320
you know,
but like,

784
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:33,340
like the actual like getting your head 
bashed and stuff like that's crazy.

785
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:35,530
It's so crazy,
you know,

786
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:40,540
and I understand money is a big driving 
factor because they probably make a lot 

787
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:40,540
of money but you know,
what,

788
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:44,890
what,
what's it worth when you're not able to 

789
00:34:44,890 --> 00:34:46,580
enjoy it when you're older and you just 
lose your brain.

790
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:49,010
It's not just money,
it's the excitement of it.

791
00:34:49,011 --> 00:34:54,011
The way I describe it is it's high level
problem solving with dire physical 

792
00:34:54,011 --> 00:34:55,310
consequences,
high level problem solving.

793
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:57,660
That's what fighting is like you have a 
skillset.

794
00:34:57,770 --> 00:35:02,770
I have a skill set,
like we're playing a game and the game 

795
00:35:02,770 --> 00:35:05,561
is I want to try to hit you with my 
bones and you're trying to hit me with 

796
00:35:05,561 --> 00:35:09,131
your bones.
And we're trying to figure out who's 

797
00:35:09,131 --> 00:35:09,950
better at it and I know that you know 
what I know you,

798
00:35:09,970 --> 00:35:13,750
you like if you get to a certain level,
like say what are.

799
00:35:13,870 --> 00:35:17,510
One of the things that I love about 
Jujitsu is a Jujitsu sort of solve this,

800
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:18,380
but it does.

801
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:23,380
So without hitting each other.
Jujitsu is all grappling and there's 

802
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:24,230
obviously a lot of injuries that come 
through from Jujitsu.

803
00:35:24,410 --> 00:35:29,410
I think that's what I meant when I,
when I was using something that looks 

804
00:35:29,410 --> 00:35:29,410
kind of cool.
Yeah.

805
00:35:29,410 --> 00:35:33,411
I like the world you just do.
Championships just happened this past 

806
00:35:33,411 --> 00:35:33,411
weekend.
I was watching some of the videos online

807
00:35:33,411 --> 00:35:35,970
and you watch these really high level 
guys going after it and it's,

808
00:35:35,971 --> 00:35:40,971
it's amazing is beautiful.
They're attacking and counter attacking 

809
00:35:40,971 --> 00:35:42,480
and you just.
And me in my mind,

810
00:35:42,481 --> 00:35:46,530
I'm thinking of the countless hours of 
dedication and focus.

811
00:35:46,531 --> 00:35:49,680
It's required to reach this level of 
proficiency where they're just,

812
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:54,980
they know what to do and when to do.
Trying to counter and they know and 

813
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:55,500
they're both black belts at a very high 
level.

814
00:35:55,501 --> 00:35:57,460
So it's like you're,
you're,

815
00:35:57,540 --> 00:36:02,540
you're examining this game.
And it doesn't have the same feeling 

816
00:36:03,361 --> 00:36:05,340
when someone loses that an mma fight 
has,

817
00:36:05,341 --> 00:36:10,341
like,
I watched the UFC this past weekend and 

818
00:36:10,341 --> 00:36:12,021
there's some brutal knockouts and when 
you watch someone get caseload and you 

819
00:36:12,021 --> 00:36:12,630
see their,
their brain shut off,

820
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:14,700
their leg stiffened up and they'd go 
flat.

821
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,400
I saw,
I saw someone get knocked out,

822
00:36:17,790 --> 00:36:20,310
I forgot who it was,
but it was like one of the last,

823
00:36:20,311 --> 00:36:22,800
like most exciting fights.
And it was like he,

824
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,600
it was,
it was crazy.

825
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:26,340
Yeah,
for sure.

826
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:31,360
And,
and I think we talked about this last 

827
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:34,821
time a couple years ago,
but the apoe e four gene I think really 

828
00:36:34,821 --> 00:36:38,661
is something that would at least give 
some insight because I mean it's known 

829
00:36:38,661 --> 00:36:40,840
that people that have at least one of 
those gene,

830
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:44,040
that gene,
they can have really,

831
00:36:44,041 --> 00:36:49,041
really bad consequences if they get Tbi.
I mean we're talking 10 to 20 fold more 

832
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:53,100
risk for Cte for other 20 fold more if 
they have.

833
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:54,900
Yeah.
If they have two copies of it.

834
00:36:54,901 --> 00:36:57,390
So they're like homozygous,
which is a lot less common.

835
00:36:58,110 --> 00:37:00,240
One copy is more common.
That would be,

836
00:37:00,410 --> 00:37:01,920
um,
you know,

837
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:04,590
anywhere like a,
like a two to five fold,

838
00:37:04,770 --> 00:37:09,180
but when you have two copies it can be,
it can be up 10 to 20 fold higher.

839
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:11,700
So that's something that's like,
you know,

840
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:12,860
with,
with the,

841
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:17,010
with the MMA,
the UFC kind of fighting,

842
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:19,950
I mean,
or football or boxing or you know,

843
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:22,590
fill in the blank sports that you know,
is very,

844
00:37:22,591 --> 00:37:24,310
um,
has a high risk for,

845
00:37:24,311 --> 00:37:29,311
for Tbi.
Like I think that's something that 

846
00:37:29,311 --> 00:37:31,671
athletes should consider and,
and you probably would find ones that 

847
00:37:31,891 --> 00:37:32,340
would say,
hey,

848
00:37:32,341 --> 00:37:34,200
maybe I shouldn't do this,
you know,

849
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:39,470
especially with football players,
know quite a few football players who 

850
00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:42,060
are aware of this are actually backing 
out of the NFL at a very young age.

851
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:45,120
I think headaches.
So there was a guy recently was 24 years

852
00:37:45,121 --> 00:37:46,390
old,
just retired and he's like,

853
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:47,690
I'm done.
Yeah.

854
00:37:47,950 --> 00:37:49,500
You know,
when he has a bright future apparently.

855
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:50,320
Well let's do it.

856
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:55,360
We got sidetracked.
So you were talking about exercise and 

857
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:55,360
the um,

858
00:37:56,370 --> 00:37:57,840
what put the hippocampus.
Oh yeah.

859
00:37:57,910 --> 00:37:58,710
Yeah.
So the,

860
00:37:58,770 --> 00:38:01,470
the,
the benefits of exercise on the brain,

861
00:38:01,830 --> 00:38:05,300
which I know that I constantly talk 
about this to you because it,

862
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:07,200
but it's just so,
you know,

863
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:09,450
it's so damn important.
It's so important,

864
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:11,580
so important.
And it is,

865
00:38:11,581 --> 00:38:16,581
it's one of those things that like,
it helps me with everything with the 

866
00:38:16,581 --> 00:38:17,160
brain.
Aging is like,

867
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:21,360
it's like it's the longterm effect.
So it helps me with the short term which

868
00:38:21,361 --> 00:38:23,160
is like handling life and handling 
stress.

869
00:38:23,161 --> 00:38:28,161
You were talking about how people have a
hard time seeing things from a higher 

870
00:38:28,161 --> 00:38:28,950
level and,
and it's so true,

871
00:38:28,951 --> 00:38:31,860
you know,
because life is hard,

872
00:38:31,861 --> 00:38:33,330
you know,
you have to like make it,

873
00:38:33,331 --> 00:38:35,830
you have to survive and if you don't 
have a starting place,

874
00:38:35,850 --> 00:38:37,960
a starting,
if your baseline is,

875
00:38:37,961 --> 00:38:42,610
is kind of like you don't have a lot to 
start with and you have to work all,

876
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:44,830
you know,
all the more work you have to put in.

877
00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:46,390
So I think that,
you know,

878
00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:48,220
getting distracted with trying to make 
money,

879
00:38:48,221 --> 00:38:50,050
you're trying to like survive and try to
look,

880
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:55,100
you know,
try to like live a good life and get 

881
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:55,120
married and have kids and all this.
It can be really stressful.

882
00:38:55,690 --> 00:38:56,590
So,
you know,

883
00:38:56,591 --> 00:39:01,591
I have of course my own stresses,
but I think that the exercises,

884
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:03,730
the short,
the short term effects I get from that,

885
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:05,860
you know,
are helping with clarity.

886
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:07,890
Helping me with,
um,

887
00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:11,200
being able to kind of take,
take a step back and not be so anxious.

888
00:39:11,201 --> 00:39:16,201
And there's,
there's controlled trials showing this 

889
00:39:16,201 --> 00:39:16,201
as well with,
with exercise.

890
00:39:16,201 --> 00:39:16,330
Um,
you know,

891
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:21,420
I,
for the longest time have been a runner 

892
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:21,760
and running is like,
for me,

893
00:39:22,590 --> 00:39:23,790
you know,
I love the,

894
00:39:23,791 --> 00:39:25,630
the frame of mind I'm in when I'm 
running,

895
00:39:25,631 --> 00:39:28,990
like it's kind of like this reflective 
daydreaming,

896
00:39:28,991 --> 00:39:33,991
which some people in some studies say,
well Jay dreaming is not good because 

897
00:39:33,991 --> 00:39:35,200
you're ruminating when you're 
daydreaming.

898
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:40,200
But I think the daydreaming that you do 
when you're like running is a lot 

899
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,920
different from like if you and I are 
having this conversation right now,

900
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:43,670
but I wasn't present.
Right.

901
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:45,780
So that's called rumination and that 
that's like,

902
00:39:45,830 --> 00:39:48,110
that's a stressful kind of.
Yeah.

903
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:53,320
Where you're,
where you're not present because you're 

904
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:53,320
worried about this other thing you have 
to do.

905
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:53,320
Right.
But the,

906
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:57,100
the daydreaming effect when I'm running 
is a little bit more of a reflective.

907
00:39:57,130 --> 00:40:00,250
Like it's a good.
It's like a cleansing for me.

908
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:01,930
So I've always.
When you run.

909
00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:07,470
Yeah.
I saw that you've recently gotten into 

910
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:07,470
that,
which is over the past year.

911
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:11,100
The literally last January started 
because a friend of mine how to run a 

912
00:40:11,310 --> 00:40:12,380
in,
in Vegas.

913
00:40:12,381 --> 00:40:15,930
So five.
I jumped in it with zero running at all.

914
00:40:15,950 --> 00:40:16,460
I'm like,
God,

915
00:40:16,510 --> 00:40:18,280
this is fucking hard.
I was like,

916
00:40:18,281 --> 00:40:18,970
I'm in shape.

917
00:40:19,210 --> 00:40:21,310
I'll just go run.
But I never ran.

918
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:24,490
I literally never.
Now I run every week and it was hard for

919
00:40:24,491 --> 00:40:24,820
you,
right,

920
00:40:24,821 --> 00:40:29,821
because you're right part.
But what's interesting is my cardio for 

921
00:40:29,821 --> 00:40:29,821
everything else has gone through the 
roof.

922
00:40:29,821 --> 00:40:31,480
It's because I'm running like brutal 
trails,

923
00:40:31,481 --> 00:40:36,210
like really steep mountain trails and 
I'm doing the most.

924
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:38,620
It was four miles.
The least I do is one mile.

925
00:40:38,950 --> 00:40:40,530
Sometimes I do too,
but it's,

926
00:40:40,650 --> 00:40:43,030
it's essentially hill sprints.
Okay.

927
00:40:43,031 --> 00:40:48,031
So you're doing something,
you're getting some high intensity in 

928
00:40:48,031 --> 00:40:48,031
there,
you're sprinting.

929
00:40:48,031 --> 00:40:49,780
It's very high intensity and it's all,
it's all like really extensive cardio.

930
00:40:49,781 --> 00:40:52,550
It's like it's heavy duty stuff.
I run with my dog now.

931
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:55,570
That's awesome.
So what's interesting is for me,

932
00:40:55,571 --> 00:40:56,860
um,
after pregnancy,

933
00:40:57,190 --> 00:41:01,150
like I couldn't wait to go out running 
and so I think it was four weeks in four

934
00:41:01,151 --> 00:41:02,310
weeks,
four weeks postpartum.

935
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:04,630
I went out for a run.
I saw your instagram post.

936
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:05,380
Yeah.
Okay.

937
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:07,060
So I went out for a run.
I was super extreme.

938
00:41:07,061 --> 00:41:12,061
That's probably the only post I did 
because what I found out as I was 

939
00:41:12,061 --> 00:41:15,781
running is I didn't feel so great.
Like I felt like my bladder felt full 

940
00:41:15,781 --> 00:41:17,040
even though it wasn't like.
And so I would,

941
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:20,470
I would stop and go to the bathroom,
like on my run and then I was like,

942
00:41:20,471 --> 00:41:21,550
okay,
and then run again.

943
00:41:22,210 --> 00:41:26,080
It still felt full and I was like,
this is not normal like this,

944
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:27,970
you know,
so um,

945
00:41:28,090 --> 00:41:32,560
so I went to my ob Gyn,
talked to him and apparently your pelvic

946
00:41:32,561 --> 00:41:33,980
floor,
like changes

947
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:36,430
after having a baby and that can like,
you know,

948
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:39,260
fall down and kind of hit your bladder a
little.

949
00:41:39,261 --> 00:41:44,261
And so it feels,
some women actually like pee urinate 

950
00:41:44,261 --> 00:41:44,261
when they're running.
Like I never had it like that.

951
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:48,620
Well he looked at my pelvic floor was 
like on a scale from zero to 10,

952
00:41:48,650 --> 00:41:50,150
zero being the best,
your one.

953
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:50,870
And I'm like,
really?

954
00:41:50,871 --> 00:41:53,180
Because I feel like a seven,
you know?

955
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:55,790
And so he was like,
well you probably shouldn't have started

956
00:41:55,791 --> 00:41:57,560
running so soon,
so don't do that.

957
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:03,040
Why don't you start doing some low 
impact exercise and start doing these 

958
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:06,560
like strength,
like strengthening your pelvic floor 

959
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:06,560
with like key goals and some core 
strength,

960
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:07,910
which I've been doing so.
So I was like,

961
00:42:07,970 --> 00:42:09,200
crap,
what am I going to do?

962
00:42:09,201 --> 00:42:11,750
Like running.
I would just walk out the door and go,

963
00:42:11,810 --> 00:42:12,530
you know,
run.

964
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:16,250
And that was like my escape.
So I started doing this.

965
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:20,720
The cycling class,
high intensity interval cycling class,

966
00:42:20,721 --> 00:42:25,721
which is,
it's an hour long and it's a spin class 

967
00:42:25,721 --> 00:42:25,721
but it's not like the dance spin,
so it's the,

968
00:42:25,721 --> 00:42:28,940
it's,
it's a spin class where you do hills and

969
00:42:28,941 --> 00:42:31,670
sprints and it's,
it's an hour long,

970
00:42:31,671 --> 00:42:36,671
but you're mixing it with just a robotic
and so you get these sprints and these 

971
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:37,580
hills and I really,
really,

972
00:42:37,581 --> 00:42:42,581
really like it for multiple reasons.
One is the group setting where I feel 

973
00:42:42,861 --> 00:42:46,040
like the people around me and like 
they're still going at it,

974
00:42:46,041 --> 00:42:47,210
you know,
so it's like motivating.

975
00:42:47,211 --> 00:42:52,211
So I keep going to.
There's something about that group that 

976
00:42:52,211 --> 00:42:55,541
really like I push.
If it were just me on that bike for an 

977
00:42:55,541 --> 00:42:55,970
hour,
there's no way I would be pushing it.

978
00:42:55,971 --> 00:42:57,590
Like I do,
like I am pushing it.

979
00:42:57,591 --> 00:42:59,030
It's like amazing pushing it.

980
00:43:00,140 --> 00:43:01,580
I feel that way about yoga class.

981
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:07,200
Yeah.
For the growth is everyone's sort of 

982
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:07,200
feeding off each other.
Right,

983
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:07,200
right,
right.

984
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,460
And then also having the instructor,
like there's a couple instructors that I

985
00:43:09,461 --> 00:43:11,260
really,
really like and you know,

986
00:43:11,261 --> 00:43:16,261
because they liked their style and 
they're kind of more like coaches and 

987
00:43:16,261 --> 00:43:19,650
then the kind of instructor that kind of
makes you want to feel there's an 

988
00:43:19,650 --> 00:43:22,351
instructor that's like,
they their cheerleader kind of want to 

989
00:43:22,351 --> 00:43:25,951
make you feel good.
And then there's the instructor where 

990
00:43:25,951 --> 00:43:25,951
they're like a coach where they're like 
the trying to help you get better.

991
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:29,470
So this icon does high intensity,
high intensity interval training.

992
00:43:29,530 --> 00:43:32,530
And I've never really been into it that 
much.

993
00:43:32,531 --> 00:43:33,070
Like I was,
you know,

994
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:36,520
I would do some like jump squats and 
things like that,

995
00:43:36,521 --> 00:43:41,521
like at home,
but this is the first time I'm like 

996
00:43:41,521 --> 00:43:41,521
really it's structured environment and 
really doing it.

997
00:43:41,521 --> 00:43:46,381
So I started reading about it,
like wanting to know because that's how 

998
00:43:46,381 --> 00:43:48,721
I am.
If I do something I'm like well I'm 

999
00:43:48,721 --> 00:43:50,861
going to look into it.
And either it will motivate me to like 

1000
00:43:50,861 --> 00:43:50,861
really keep it up and do it more or I'll
be like,

1001
00:43:50,861 --> 00:43:51,550
no,
this isn't good,

1002
00:43:51,970 --> 00:43:53,620
you know?
So I started reading more and more about

1003
00:43:53,621 --> 00:43:58,621
it.
And it's amazing the benefits of the 

1004
00:43:58,621 --> 00:43:58,621
high intensity.
So you were talking about how,

1005
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:00,280
how your,
your,

1006
00:44:00,281 --> 00:44:02,710
I think what you were describing was 
your aerobic capacity

1007
00:44:03,330 --> 00:44:08,330
change for the big one.
Is kickboxing like the when when I hit 

1008
00:44:08,330 --> 00:44:09,470
the bag,
he used to be that I would,

1009
00:44:09,530 --> 00:44:12,580
I would struggle to do a three minute 
round of,

1010
00:44:12,590 --> 00:44:14,330
of high,
high intensity,

1011
00:44:14,331 --> 00:44:17,420
like hitting the bag kickboxing.
But now I can,

1012
00:44:17,630 --> 00:44:19,700
I get through it,
the bell goes off and I'm like,

1013
00:44:19,701 --> 00:44:20,750
really?
Okay.

1014
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:22,370
Like the bell just went off.
All right,

1015
00:44:22,371 --> 00:44:27,371
that's three minutes.
And then I'll have the 32nd rest by the 

1016
00:44:27,371 --> 00:44:27,371
term.
30 second rest is up.

1017
00:44:27,371 --> 00:44:28,910
I'm fully recovered and I'm back in 
again.

1018
00:44:28,911 --> 00:44:29,480
I just,
it's,

1019
00:44:29,870 --> 00:44:32,310
I mean like I have more than double

1020
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:33,040
the endurance stay.

1021
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:34,190
So.
So they're,

1022
00:44:34,310 --> 00:44:39,310
they're.
What you're experiencing has been 

1023
00:44:39,310 --> 00:44:41,531
studied in clinical studies.
Basically this aerobic capacity also 

1024
00:44:41,531 --> 00:44:46,210
people call it a vo two Max,
which is basically the ability of your 

1025
00:44:46,210 --> 00:44:50,201
lungs and your blood and your heart to 
carry oxygen to your muscles are places 

1026
00:44:50,201 --> 00:44:50,520
that are,
you know,

1027
00:44:50,570 --> 00:44:53,480
during that intense push.
So the capacity to do that.

1028
00:44:53,481 --> 00:44:56,840
Right?
Well as we age,

1029
00:44:56,841 --> 00:44:59,990
over the age of 25,
once we hit 25 and we continue on,

1030
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:03,230
our aerobic capacity decreases by 10 
percent per decade.

1031
00:45:03,231 --> 00:45:05,120
So like one percent per year.
Right.

1032
00:45:05,121 --> 00:45:06,690
So you're basically,
you know,

1033
00:45:06,890 --> 00:45:08,430
25 year 35,
your,

1034
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:13,500
your vo two Max.
Your is like 10 percent less than you 

1035
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:16,571
were when you were 25.
Well it turns out doing these high 

1036
00:45:16,571 --> 00:45:17,210
intensity interval classes during 24 of 
them,

1037
00:45:17,510 --> 00:45:22,510
which in this study it was like there 
were 40 minutes long and there was four 

1038
00:45:22,510 --> 00:45:23,970
four minute pushes and then there's,
you know,

1039
00:45:24,030 --> 00:45:29,030
recoveries in between and all that,
blah blah blah stuff they were able to 

1040
00:45:29,030 --> 00:45:29,030
improve.

1041
00:45:29,090 --> 00:45:34,090
And after eight weeks of doing 24 high 
intensity classes improve their vo two 

1042
00:45:34,090 --> 00:45:36,320
Max by like 12 percent.
So you're basically adding a decade,

1043
00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:38,380
you know,
back to your point.

1044
00:45:38,381 --> 00:45:39,710
Many weeks.
Well they did it.

1045
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:41,870
They did 24 classes of this in eight 
weeks.

1046
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:44,120
Wow.
So what the interesting thing about that

1047
00:45:44,121 --> 00:45:46,120
study was they were also testing whether
or not like,

1048
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:51,480
like I'm doing it,
I think it was like four weeks or 

1049
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:54,941
something really like short,
just packing them all in the actually 

1050
00:45:54,941 --> 00:45:59,320
didn't increase the vo two Max as much 
because the recovery time was actually 

1051
00:45:59,320 --> 00:45:59,320
important.

1052
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:02,890
It's actually changed the way I think 
about when it comes to training and my 

1053
00:46:02,890 --> 00:46:03,770
advice that I give to people for 
training because I used to think that it

1054
00:46:03,771 --> 00:46:08,080
was adequate to just do the sports 
specific workouts like say if you wanted

1055
00:46:08,090 --> 00:46:10,580
to get better at Jujitsu,
just do Jujitsu.

1056
00:46:10,581 --> 00:46:12,930
Do you want to get better at kickboxing?
Just to your kickboxing.

1057
00:46:12,931 --> 00:46:14,900
The cardio you get from that will be 
enough.

1058
00:46:15,110 --> 00:46:20,110
I don't think that's the case anymore 
because I'm stunned at how much of an 

1059
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:23,921
increase in cardio that I've gotten from
these hill sprints and now I realize 

1060
00:46:23,921 --> 00:46:23,921
like,
okay,

1061
00:46:23,921 --> 00:46:28,570
what you can do is you can do it 
independently of that work and it 

1062
00:46:29,511 --> 00:46:34,511
doesn't really mess with that work.
Like say if I run in the morning and I 

1063
00:46:34,511 --> 00:46:39,011
get a good two mile run,
I can still hit the bag at three in the 

1064
00:46:39,011 --> 00:46:40,900
afternoon,
but the difference will be is I like,

1065
00:46:40,910 --> 00:46:45,910
my legs will be tired from running,
but they're not the same muscles that I 

1066
00:46:45,910 --> 00:46:48,920
use when I kick box.
But what's similar in a lot of ways,

1067
00:46:48,921 --> 00:46:53,921
but with what's really changing for sure
is that my aerobic capacity is just way 

1068
00:46:53,921 --> 00:46:54,200
bigger.

1069
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:55,650
It's just awesome.
It's just different.

1070
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:57,960
That's actually a marker of aging 
aerobic capacity.

1071
00:46:57,961 --> 00:47:02,961
Vo Two Max.
I've never actually measured my own vo 

1072
00:47:02,961 --> 00:47:02,961
two Max.
Um,

1073
00:47:02,961 --> 00:47:07,110
I probably have to put that hosting.
I don't want to do it because now that 

1074
00:47:07,110 --> 00:47:09,600
I'm doing all this high intensity work 
and I'm totally going to stick with it.

1075
00:47:09,601 --> 00:47:13,290
Like I love it,
but I definitely want to get back to the

1076
00:47:13,291 --> 00:47:17,070
running and I've been sort of worried 
about I can only do so much as a new mom

1077
00:47:17,071 --> 00:47:22,071
and working on a trip.
Would you be interested in a treadmill 

1078
00:47:22,071 --> 00:47:22,071
or.
No?

1079
00:47:22,071 --> 00:47:24,900
You know,
I love running outside like in nature,

1080
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:28,140
whether it's in the beach or I'm like in
the hills,

1081
00:47:28,141 --> 00:47:29,790
rolling hills and stuff,
but you know,

1082
00:47:29,890 --> 00:47:30,040
for

1083
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:35,040
the longest time I lived in Tennessee 
and the weather there is not great and 

1084
00:47:35,621 --> 00:47:37,780
so I did do treadmill running and so 
yeah,

1085
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,910
I definitely,
I don't,

1086
00:47:40,310 --> 00:47:45,070
I don't have the same daydreaming like 
effect that I,

1087
00:47:45,130 --> 00:47:50,130
but I do definitely.
I mean it's definitely good and I get a 

1088
00:47:50,130 --> 00:47:52,300
lot from it from a treadmill,
but there's something about,

1089
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:55,840
in fact there was some interesting study
that I don't know how long ago,

1090
00:47:55,841 --> 00:47:59,620
maybe a year ago or two that looked at 
people that exercise,

1091
00:47:59,621 --> 00:48:04,621
I think they went for like walks or 
something in nature versus like in the 

1092
00:48:04,621 --> 00:48:06,460
metropolitan area and the benefits there
was,

1093
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:11,170
there was more benefits in going for 
walks in nature in terms of like,

1094
00:48:11,390 --> 00:48:12,610
you know,
psychological benefits,

1095
00:48:12,611 --> 00:48:15,340
but also some of the variety of like 
biomarkers that were measured.

1096
00:48:16,630 --> 00:48:18,910
So it kind of interesting.
You know,

1097
00:48:19,180 --> 00:48:19,840
it is interesting.

1098
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:25,040
I think we like to think of ourselves as
being detached from what we experienced 

1099
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:26,700
just in terms of even just visually,
but I,

1100
00:48:26,701 --> 00:48:31,650
I think that those things have an effect
on not just how you think,

1101
00:48:31,651 --> 00:48:33,990
like how you feel,
but who you are.

1102
00:48:34,230 --> 00:48:34,600
I mean,
I,

1103
00:48:34,601 --> 00:48:39,601
I think we are,
we have some sort of a symbiotic 

1104
00:48:39,601 --> 00:48:42,060
relationship with our environment and 
when your environment is cement in glass

1105
00:48:42,061 --> 00:48:46,230
and concrete and rubber and all the 
things that we've created in cities that

1106
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:49,850
there's a dull feeling that you get from
those things and then when you,

1107
00:48:49,851 --> 00:48:53,250
you can go and see a green meadow and 
birds flying around and,

1108
00:48:53,410 --> 00:48:58,410
and the,
the wind whistling through the leaves 

1109
00:48:58,410 --> 00:48:58,410
like you,
you just,

1110
00:48:58,410 --> 00:48:59,850
it does something to your body does 
something,

1111
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:03,650
not just your mind.
There's something going on like you,

1112
00:49:03,651 --> 00:49:05,700
you,
you have like this feeling of,

1113
00:49:05,730 --> 00:49:07,140
Oh,
this is medicine.

1114
00:49:07,390 --> 00:49:09,060
This is,
I'm getting something out of this.

1115
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:10,330
Yeah,
absolutely.

1116
00:49:10,331 --> 00:49:13,390
I think that there's the noise 
pollution,

1117
00:49:13,391 --> 00:49:14,110
the sound,
you know,

1118
00:49:14,210 --> 00:49:19,210
like the cars and all that.
That's been shown to have a negative 

1119
00:49:19,210 --> 00:49:20,470
effect on people's emotions.
And,

1120
00:49:20,570 --> 00:49:22,150
and I'm in,
of course,

1121
00:49:22,151 --> 00:49:27,151
there's the environmental things,
you're breathing in pollution and that 

1122
00:49:27,151 --> 00:49:28,240
has been shown to increase inflammatory 
biomarkers and all that.

1123
00:49:28,660 --> 00:49:33,660
But there's certainly,
I think the just going out into nature 

1124
00:49:33,660 --> 00:49:33,660
and you,
you,

1125
00:49:33,660 --> 00:49:35,110
you feel better.
You Do,

1126
00:49:35,111 --> 00:49:36,910
you definitely,
you definitely feel better.

1127
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:38,860
It's not,
you know,

1128
00:49:38,870 --> 00:49:43,870
not I live in the city and I live off of
a busy place and thankfully we're going 

1129
00:49:43,870 --> 00:49:48,121
to be moving.
But that's something I'm considering 

1130
00:49:48,121 --> 00:49:49,891
where it's just like,
are you moving specifically for that 

1131
00:49:49,891 --> 00:49:49,891
reason?
No,

1132
00:49:49,891 --> 00:49:53,450
we're just in a small apartment right 
now and it's like I have a baby now and 

1133
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:55,450
it's fun to people.
Yeah,

1134
00:49:55,451 --> 00:49:58,360
it was fine.
It was close to the beach and you know,

1135
00:49:58,660 --> 00:50:00,170
it was,
it's fun like,

1136
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:02,580
but just,
it's not something that,

1137
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:03,510
that,
you know,

1138
00:50:03,970 --> 00:50:05,100
I could do with,
with,

1139
00:50:05,150 --> 00:50:06,970
with the baby,
especially in such a small space.

1140
00:50:06,971 --> 00:50:09,640
And there's motorcycles that go by and 
it's like,

1141
00:50:10,270 --> 00:50:15,270
it's crazy.
Like the motorcycles that they wrap up 

1142
00:50:15,270 --> 00:50:18,130
their writing by exactly the writing by 
and it's like that's a bummer.

1143
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:19,140
It's,
yeah,

1144
00:50:19,910 --> 00:50:24,910
to now.
So I'm also like a yard is good for a 

1145
00:50:24,910 --> 00:50:24,910
kid.
Right,

1146
00:50:24,910 --> 00:50:24,910
right,

1147
00:50:24,910 --> 00:50:26,130
exactly.
But it's hard.

1148
00:50:26,310 --> 00:50:27,830
It's hard in,
you know,

1149
00:50:27,831 --> 00:50:28,110
I mean

1150
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:29,270
like we were saying,
you know,

1151
00:50:29,271 --> 00:50:31,960
it's not easy,
so there's things you have,

1152
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:34,100
there's just all this stuff you have to 
consider when you're,

1153
00:50:34,450 --> 00:50:36,680
your priorities changed now,
now that you,

1154
00:50:36,710 --> 00:50:38,930
when you have a child,
it's like you've got to think of all the

1155
00:50:38,931 --> 00:50:43,931
things schools and this and that 
neighbors and who were they going to be 

1156
00:50:43,931 --> 00:50:43,931
friends with and like,
oh my God,

1157
00:50:44,350 --> 00:50:46,450
before I forget,
I wanted to tell people,

1158
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:49,300
go to Chris Kresser,
his instagram or his,

1159
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:50,800
excuse me,
his twitter page,

1160
00:50:51,010 --> 00:50:56,010
and there's an article on Acetaminophen 
and women who are pregnant consuming 

1161
00:50:57,190 --> 00:51:00,640
Acetaminophen and the negative 
consequences it has for children.

1162
00:51:00,970 --> 00:51:05,970
See more evidence.
It says here that the exposure to 

1163
00:51:05,970 --> 00:51:06,850
Acetaminophen may be a part of adhd 
puzzle.

1164
00:51:07,030 --> 00:51:10,840
A Norwegian study,
pregnant women took Acetaminophen for 29

1165
00:51:10,841 --> 00:51:15,841
days or more,
had a more than twofold risk of having 

1166
00:51:15,841 --> 00:51:15,841
children with Adhd.

1167
00:51:16,070 --> 00:51:16,700
Yeah.
Wow.

1168
00:51:17,070 --> 00:51:18,600
Tylenol,
I think I've seen.

1169
00:51:18,660 --> 00:51:23,660
I think I even tweeted something like 
this like a couple of years ago where 

1170
00:51:23,660 --> 00:51:25,440
this isn't the first study where in New 
York Times right now apparently,

1171
00:51:26,390 --> 00:51:29,370
and that's what people are prescribed 
right during pregnancy.

1172
00:51:29,930 --> 00:51:31,030
Scary Shit.
There's,

1173
00:51:31,050 --> 00:51:36,050
I mean it's how many things we find out 
from like the 19 sixties were terribly 

1174
00:51:36,050 --> 00:51:40,691
detrimental to children and doctors are 
telling you this is the way you should 

1175
00:51:40,691 --> 00:51:40,691
go.
I mean there's.

1176
00:51:40,691 --> 00:51:43,410
So that's the,
you know,

1177
00:51:43,411 --> 00:51:44,040
with,
um,

1178
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:49,280
when I was pregnant there was,
there were certainly some things that I 

1179
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:51,690
opted out of that we're probably more 
standard of care,

1180
00:51:52,170 --> 00:51:53,040
you know,
so,

1181
00:51:53,590 --> 00:51:56,610
uh,
just because of concern and,

1182
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:59,790
and not that I knew for a fact that 
something was gonna happen,

1183
00:51:59,791 --> 00:52:04,791
but I had doubt and that was enough for 
me to sort of weigh the benefits and the

1184
00:52:04,891 --> 00:52:05,640
risks.
And I was like,

1185
00:52:05,641 --> 00:52:07,590
well,
you know,

1186
00:52:07,710 --> 00:52:08,100
so.

1187
00:52:08,610 --> 00:52:12,270
Well there's even talk about vaccination
protocols.

1188
00:52:12,271 --> 00:52:13,560
Like not whether or not,
I mean,

1189
00:52:13,561 --> 00:52:16,680
I'm not an anti vaccination person.
I think vaccinations are important,

1190
00:52:17,010 --> 00:52:21,000
but I think that there's a lot of merit 
in the idea of that.

1191
00:52:21,001 --> 00:52:26,001
You shoot a kid up at 36 different shots
when they're six weeks old or whatever 

1192
00:52:26,001 --> 00:52:28,470
age they start them out right out of the
box.

1193
00:52:28,890 --> 00:52:33,890
They give a lot of doctors want to give 
your kid a series of shots and that 

1194
00:52:33,890 --> 00:52:38,630
there's some,
there's some concern that the actual 

1195
00:52:38,630 --> 00:52:43,221
consequences of all these different 
vaccines being put into your child's 

1196
00:52:43,221 --> 00:52:48,201
body very early and a large number of 
them have some sort of negative 

1197
00:52:48,201 --> 00:52:48,690
consequences.

1198
00:52:49,150 --> 00:52:49,840
It,
you know,

1199
00:52:49,870 --> 00:52:50,750
I'm,
I'm with you.

1200
00:52:50,751 --> 00:52:53,510
Like I'm also not an antibody or I think
vaccines are important.

1201
00:52:53,540 --> 00:52:56,270
I'm going to vaccinate my son.
But um,

1202
00:52:56,540 --> 00:52:57,670
and I've,
I've already given.

1203
00:52:57,680 --> 00:52:59,600
I'm a little behind on the schedule.
I've given him one.

1204
00:52:59,601 --> 00:53:04,601
But.
So what you're saying is true there is 

1205
00:53:04,601 --> 00:53:05,360
like even on the CDC website,
it says that,

1206
00:53:05,390 --> 00:53:10,390
you know,
some of these vaccines can cause I'm 

1207
00:53:10,390 --> 00:53:10,970
fevers and epileptic seizures,
seizures,

1208
00:53:10,971 --> 00:53:15,971
seizures in infants and,
but that there's no longterm consequence

1209
00:53:16,260 --> 00:53:16,780
of that.
And,

1210
00:53:17,030 --> 00:53:18,770
and that's kind of like,
you know,

1211
00:53:18,771 --> 00:53:21,740
if you look,
if you look at the literature and,

1212
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:26,800
and how the immune,
the immune system response to some of 

1213
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:27,510
these vaccines,
especially if you're giving like five at

1214
00:53:27,511 --> 00:53:32,511
once.
I mean the first round of vaccines that 

1215
00:53:32,511 --> 00:53:32,511
I'm supposed to do,
it was like,

1216
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:37,320
it was like five different vaccines.
And so what I'm opting to do is actually

1217
00:53:37,321 --> 00:53:38,760
do them in singles where you.

1218
00:53:38,820 --> 00:53:43,820
So yeah,
because it's like why the immune 

1219
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:45,760
response is,
you know,

1220
00:53:46,110 --> 00:53:51,110
kind of the thing that's scary and you 
don't really know how a child's immune 

1221
00:53:51,110 --> 00:53:52,260
system is going to react.
And there are studies.

1222
00:53:52,261 --> 00:53:57,261
I was particularly worried about it 
during pregnancy and that's when one of 

1223
00:53:57,261 --> 00:53:57,610
the things I opted out of was getting,
um,

1224
00:53:58,230 --> 00:54:00,930
the td APP,
a vaccine,

1225
00:54:00,931 --> 00:54:02,670
which is they want to give it to you 
when you're,

1226
00:54:02,850 --> 00:54:07,140
I forgot how many weeks pregnant.
I'm 30 something I think.

1227
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:12,410
And uh,
to protect basically pass on antibodies 

1228
00:54:12,410 --> 00:54:12,410
for whooping cough,
you know,

1229
00:54:12,410 --> 00:54:12,410
to the,
to the baby.

1230
00:54:12,780 --> 00:54:16,050
And so I opted out and I said I would do
it post basically postpartum,

1231
00:54:16,051 --> 00:54:21,051
like one day postpartum because it takes
about four weeks to transfer the 

1232
00:54:21,051 --> 00:54:21,760
antibodies in breast milk.
So I still was gonna,

1233
00:54:21,810 --> 00:54:22,890
you know,
get the vaccine.

1234
00:54:22,891 --> 00:54:24,350
But I was going to do it after I had 
the.

1235
00:54:24,990 --> 00:54:29,990
And the.
And the reason I made that decision is 

1236
00:54:29,990 --> 00:54:31,671
because there have been multiple studies
now in nonhuman primates that have 

1237
00:54:32,791 --> 00:54:35,100
looked on these studies,
came out of UC Davis,

1238
00:54:35,850 --> 00:54:39,840
looked at pregnant female monkeys on 
when they're,

1239
00:54:39,870 --> 00:54:42,030
when they have a really strong immune 
response.

1240
00:54:42,031 --> 00:54:45,840
So like a strong infection or you know,
who knows a vaccine.

1241
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:50,340
The study didn't use vaccines,
but I'm sort of drawing a parallel here.

1242
00:54:50,530 --> 00:54:53,670
Whereas just the immune response having 
very strong immune response.

1243
00:54:53,671 --> 00:54:58,671
There was an autoimmune response that 
ended up having antibodies that attack 

1244
00:54:58,671 --> 00:55:02,390
the developing brain.
And the monkeys that were born from 

1245
00:55:02,390 --> 00:55:02,390
those mothers were had autistic like 
behaviors.

1246
00:55:02,780 --> 00:55:06,480
It's been shown in humans that mothers 
of autistic children are five times more

1247
00:55:06,481 --> 00:55:11,481
likely to have antibodies floating 
around in their blood against fetal 

1248
00:55:11,481 --> 00:55:14,661
brain proteins.
Like they're not supposed to have 

1249
00:55:14,661 --> 00:55:14,661
antibodies against fetal brain proteins 
in their blood.

1250
00:55:14,661 --> 00:55:19,340
So there's definitely been some link 
with the immune system and autoimmunity,

1251
00:55:21,630 --> 00:55:24,480
particularly during pregnancy and autism
risk.

1252
00:55:25,050 --> 00:55:26,490
Now,
in terms of like the,

1253
00:55:26,491 --> 00:55:28,230
the young baby,
you know,

1254
00:55:28,231 --> 00:55:28,910
I'm,
I'm,

1255
00:55:29,030 --> 00:55:30,930
I'm scared too.
And I do.

1256
00:55:30,990 --> 00:55:32,950
I do worry that,
you know,

1257
00:55:33,030 --> 00:55:38,030
my,
my son's developing so great and like I 

1258
00:55:38,030 --> 00:55:38,030
don't want to do something wrong.
It's,

1259
00:55:38,030 --> 00:55:38,600
it's scary.
It really is.

1260
00:55:38,601 --> 00:55:39,930
And you know,
I definitely,

1261
00:55:39,931 --> 00:55:41,880
like I said,
I'm going to vaccinate my son and I have

1262
00:55:41,881 --> 00:55:44,400
been doing singles and that you have to 
like,

1263
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:49,440
it's,
it's a little more inconvenient because 

1264
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:49,440
you have to go to the doctor like so 
many times to do it.

1265
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:52,890
But the thing is is that when you don't,
when you're not giving so many different

1266
00:55:52,891 --> 00:55:55,740
vaccines at once,
the immune response isn't going to be as

1267
00:55:55,741 --> 00:55:56,160
strong.

1268
00:55:56,420 --> 00:56:01,420
And there's a problem with this 
conversation and one of the problems 

1269
00:56:01,420 --> 00:56:01,820
with this conversation is as soon as you
talk about vaccines,

1270
00:56:02,090 --> 00:56:07,090
you immediately get lumped into a bunch 
of fucking crazy people that think that 

1271
00:56:07,090 --> 00:56:11,111
vaccines or some sort of a conspiracy.
And the government's trying to make 

1272
00:56:11,111 --> 00:56:13,940
money from you and you were an 
anti-vaxxer and they immediately box you

1273
00:56:13,941 --> 00:56:15,940
in and start getting angry at you.
It's,

1274
00:56:15,970 --> 00:56:16,940
it's,
it's almost,

1275
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:22,000
it's a weird thing because you're 
talking about chemicals that you're 

1276
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:22,010
injecting into a child,
right?

1277
00:56:22,340 --> 00:56:27,040
Yeah,
but still people are very hesitant to,

1278
00:56:27,070 --> 00:56:29,470
to even look at that.
They're very,

1279
00:56:29,510 --> 00:56:34,360
they'll you want to automatically just 
go with whatever the doctor says when it

1280
00:56:34,361 --> 00:56:39,361
comes to vaccines until.
But the real problem is until you look 

1281
00:56:39,361 --> 00:56:42,991
at like how much work has been done,
determining what the consequences are 

1282
00:56:42,991 --> 00:56:43,990
and how can you find out?

1283
00:56:43,990 --> 00:56:45,510
How can you even know?
No,

1284
00:56:45,790 --> 00:56:48,340
you really can't unless you have to have
the exact,

1285
00:56:48,450 --> 00:56:49,660
you know,
a bunch of copies.

1286
00:56:49,661 --> 00:56:54,661
You make a bunch of clowns have a baby 
and you expose them to the exact same 

1287
00:56:54,661 --> 00:56:54,661
environment.
Zach,

1288
00:56:54,661 --> 00:56:59,580
exact same epigenetics,
exact same environmental factors and 

1289
00:56:59,580 --> 00:57:01,600
then one of you and inject a bunch of 
chemicals into and one you don't.

1290
00:57:02,380 --> 00:57:05,320
I mean we know that vaccines are 
amazing.

1291
00:57:05,530 --> 00:57:10,530
They have prevented polio.
They have prevented a host of different 

1292
00:57:10,530 --> 00:57:13,861
diseases becoming real issues and we 
know that people who don't vaccinate 

1293
00:57:13,861 --> 00:57:17,281
their kids,
the the reason why measles are coming 

1294
00:57:17,281 --> 00:57:17,281
back,
they might just.

1295
00:57:17,281 --> 00:57:17,470
There's real concerns.
Absolutely.

1296
00:57:17,530 --> 00:57:20,230
I think vaccines are amazing.
I'm so happy they exist,

1297
00:57:20,290 --> 00:57:24,700
but I also think that we have to be very
careful with just jumping into things.

1298
00:57:24,701 --> 00:57:29,701
Just like we were talking before about 
things that they did as standard care 

1299
00:57:29,701 --> 00:57:30,190
during the 19 sixties are now 
prohibited.

1300
00:57:30,250 --> 00:57:31,900
Like we know they're dangerous for you.

1301
00:57:32,140 --> 00:57:32,980
Yeah.
Yeah.

1302
00:57:32,981 --> 00:57:37,981
I mean I,
I completely 100 percent agree and I 

1303
00:57:37,981 --> 00:57:37,981
think that there,
there,

1304
00:57:37,981 --> 00:57:40,300
there are now it's a growing field at 
least in science where there are,

1305
00:57:40,450 --> 00:57:43,780
there are scientists that are trying to 
understand the,

1306
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:49,000
the gene interaction,
that gene interaction with the immune 

1307
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:52,171
system because it obviously almost 
everyone gets vaccinated,

1308
00:57:52,210 --> 00:57:52,870
right?
I mean,

1309
00:57:53,260 --> 00:57:58,260
and you don't have everyone walking 
around with all these with autism and 

1310
00:57:58,260 --> 00:57:58,260
all this,
but there,

1311
00:57:58,350 --> 00:58:01,240
there is something that is going on and 
you know,

1312
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:04,750
a lot of parents have noticed changes of
course after the vaccinations.

1313
00:58:05,260 --> 00:58:08,560
And so there,
there is a new field of inquiry.

1314
00:58:08,561 --> 00:58:13,561
I do know that's ongoing.
We're scientists are beginning to now 

1315
00:58:13,561 --> 00:58:17,311
look at,
in addition to how the immune system is 

1316
00:58:17,311 --> 00:58:19,870
reacting to some of these vaccines,
how specific genes,

1317
00:58:20,130 --> 00:58:25,130
you know,
regulating certain immune functions may 

1318
00:58:25,130 --> 00:58:29,050
differences in those genes called 
polymorphisms may predispose a child.

1319
00:58:29,290 --> 00:58:32,080
Now how are you going to know that?
Like without doing a DNA test before you

1320
00:58:32,081 --> 00:58:33,850
do the vaccine?
I mean it's a risk,

1321
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:35,240
like you said,
how do you know it's it.

1322
00:58:35,241 --> 00:58:39,700
It definitely is a risk and that's,
that's what's the scary thing,

1323
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:41,410
you know,
and it's like,

1324
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:42,390
you know,
it's,

1325
00:58:42,391 --> 00:58:47,391
it's a,
it's a dilemma that I've been facing 

1326
00:58:47,391 --> 00:58:47,391
and,
and you know,

1327
00:58:47,391 --> 00:58:47,710
I,
I'm currently,

1328
00:58:47,711 --> 00:58:52,711
the reason I even delayed,
I've only given my son to vaccines so 

1329
00:58:52,711 --> 00:58:55,801
far,
but just because I'm trying to like 

1330
00:58:55,801 --> 00:58:56,740
exhaustively read the literature as much
as I can.

1331
00:58:57,140 --> 00:58:58,150
Well good.
I'm glad.

1332
00:58:58,210 --> 00:59:03,210
I'm glad that you're looking at it this 
way because it's something that there's 

1333
00:59:03,210 --> 00:59:04,240
a lot of pressure on people to not look 
at it that way.

1334
00:59:04,260 --> 00:59:06,700
There's like this just having this 
conversation,

1335
00:59:06,730 --> 00:59:08,800
Joe Rogan and Rhonda Patrick are 
anti-vaxxers.

1336
00:59:08,830 --> 00:59:11,500
That could be,
that could be the title of some bullshit

1337
00:59:11,501 --> 00:59:13,570
arc article that someone writes about 
this.

1338
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:18,760
I mean I've seen it time and time again 
where someone will write a clickbait 

1339
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:21,800
title to an article and then someone 
will just that and go,

1340
00:59:21,801 --> 00:59:22,010
oh,

1341
00:59:22,010 --> 00:59:24,440
you're an anti-vaxxer.
Of course you are,

1342
00:59:24,441 --> 00:59:29,441
you loser,
and they'll get angry at you and throw 

1343
00:59:29,441 --> 00:59:32,261
some twitter message your way.
That is not representative of your 

1344
00:59:32,261 --> 00:59:33,170
actual thoughts on this at all.
This is a very complex,

1345
00:59:33,410 --> 00:59:36,650
very nuanced issue and like,
like I said,

1346
00:59:36,680 --> 00:59:38,540
I do think people should vaccinate their
children.

1347
00:59:38,770 --> 00:59:41,520
Do as well.
Have been all right.

1348
00:59:41,521 --> 00:59:42,470
I.
I agree.

1349
00:59:42,471 --> 00:59:46,340
It's a nuanced topic that we,
you know,

1350
00:59:46,550 --> 00:59:48,830
we don't.
We don't know what the answer to.

1351
00:59:49,100 --> 00:59:52,130
I mean I think that this guy,
what was his name?

1352
00:59:52,131 --> 00:59:57,131
The guy,
the doctor that got disbarred because he

1353
00:59:57,741 --> 01:00:02,741
liked falsified some data on a thumb 
Rosalda mercury and causing autism.

1354
01:00:04,070 --> 01:00:09,070
Falsified some data or something.
What was the story behind that data that

1355
01:00:09,390 --> 01:00:12,920
was published that,
that linked thimerosal,

1356
01:00:12,921 --> 01:00:16,850
which is the agile that was found in a 
lot of vaccines in California.

1357
01:00:16,851 --> 01:00:20,570
They don't use that as far as I know,
as far as like it's not used anymore.

1358
01:00:20,670 --> 01:00:22,670
Was that the needle,
measles,

1359
01:00:22,671 --> 01:00:23,690
mumps,
rubella,

1360
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:24,920
MMR,
you know?

1361
01:00:24,990 --> 01:00:27,410
Yeah.
And so what did he do?

1362
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:29,540
What was,
I don't you know,

1363
01:00:29,660 --> 01:00:34,660
it's not like I haven't done super,
super in depth analysis of what he did 

1364
01:00:35,390 --> 01:00:38,150
to my understanding was that he just 
hold it up here.

1365
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:42,500
Journal retracts 1998 paper linking 
autism to vaccines are prominent.

1366
01:00:42,501 --> 01:00:47,501
British medical journal Tuesday,
retracted in 1998 research paper that 

1367
01:00:47,501 --> 01:00:49,580
set off a sharp decline of vaccinations 
in Britain after the papers.

1368
01:00:49,850 --> 01:00:54,850
Lead.
Author suggested that vaccines could 

1369
01:00:54,850 --> 01:00:54,850
cause autism,
the retraction,

1370
01:00:54,850 --> 01:00:54,890
blah,
blah,

1371
01:00:54,891 --> 01:00:56,270
blah.
Reassessment,

1372
01:00:56,900 --> 01:00:58,220
uh,
there's lasted for years,

1373
01:00:58,300 --> 01:01:03,300
uh,
in the scientific methods and financial 

1374
01:01:03,300 --> 01:01:03,470
conflicts.
Dr Andrew Wakefield,

1375
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:06,410
who contended that his research show 
that the combined measles,

1376
01:01:06,411 --> 01:01:08,480
mumps,
and rubella rubella.

1377
01:01:08,510 --> 01:01:10,100
How do you say it?
Rubella.

1378
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:15,160
Rubella vaccine may be unsafe,
but the retraction may do little to 

1379
01:01:15,160 --> 01:01:19,601
tarnish Dr Wakefield's fields,
reputation among parents groups in the 

1380
01:01:19,601 --> 01:01:23,440
United States,
despite a wealth of scientific studies 

1381
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:23,990
that have failed to find any link 
between vaccines and autism,

1382
01:01:24,380 --> 01:01:26,330
the parents fervently.

1383
01:01:26,330 --> 01:01:31,330
I love that word,
believe that their children's medical 

1384
01:01:31,330 --> 01:01:34,181
problems resulted from vaccines.
I know a lot of people that think their 

1385
01:01:34,251 --> 01:01:38,420
kid's medical issues came from vaccines 
and I'm not wanting to tell them they're

1386
01:01:38,421 --> 01:01:40,190
wrong.
I don't know who's right or who's wrong,

1387
01:01:40,191 --> 01:01:44,870
but I know there's a massive amount of 
money to discourage any sort of talk and

1388
01:01:44,871 --> 01:01:48,340
thinking that no one wants you to think 
there's anything wrong with vaccines and

1389
01:01:48,350 --> 01:01:50,720
vaccines can do no harm,
but you know,

1390
01:01:50,721 --> 01:01:53,030
millions of dollars have been given out 
by the vaccine courts.

1391
01:01:53,640 --> 01:01:58,640
It's not like there's.
There's vaccine courts that take care of

1392
01:01:59,121 --> 01:02:02,300
cases where people have been damaged by 
vaccines.

1393
01:02:02,301 --> 01:02:04,470
It's not.
There's no way.

1394
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:09,520
We were talking about this before the 
podcast started that we're going to 

1395
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:09,520
discuss the,
the.

1396
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:13,590
There's people very biologically,
so much that one person can eat at my 

1397
01:02:16,251 --> 01:02:17,150
friend Brian,
his,

1398
01:02:17,180 --> 01:02:19,530
his mom,
if she eats a Brazil nut,

1399
01:02:19,531 --> 01:02:20,280
she will die.

1400
01:02:21,060 --> 01:02:22,920
I could eat a whole bowl of those boring
fucking nuts.

1401
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:25,920
They don't do anything to me.
I think they're boring but increase your

1402
01:02:25,921 --> 01:02:26,700
selenium.
Oh,

1403
01:02:26,740 --> 01:02:27,840
that's nice.
It's good to have,

1404
01:02:28,290 --> 01:02:30,120
but I mean they don't do anything 
negative to me,

1405
01:02:30,630 --> 01:02:34,860
but his mom will eat them and she dies.
Now that you can,

1406
01:02:34,861 --> 01:02:39,861
I believe that you can extrapolate that 
and you can look at all sorts of 

1407
01:02:39,861 --> 01:02:39,861
different things that you take into your
body.

1408
01:02:39,861 --> 01:02:43,020
There are some people that are allergic 
to a host of different things that don't

1409
01:02:43,021 --> 01:02:48,021
do a damn thing to me and there's going 
to be people that are going to have 

1410
01:02:48,021 --> 01:02:50,490
reactions to vaccines.
It's just it's a chemical.

1411
01:02:50,730 --> 01:02:52,530
There's going to be something that 
happens in your body,

1412
01:02:52,710 --> 01:02:57,710
so the idea that there's no link 
whatsoever to a chemical causing an 

1413
01:02:57,710 --> 01:02:59,310
adverse reaction.
That doesn't jive.

1414
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:02,370
It doesn't make sense to say that it's 
impossible.

1415
01:03:02,371 --> 01:03:05,760
You could say it's extremely rare.
That makes more sense,

1416
01:03:06,120 --> 01:03:09,270
but when they say there's no link,
when you say no link,

1417
01:03:09,271 --> 01:03:11,850
I have to go,
what's motivating this?

1418
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:16,880
What's motivating you to say no link?
Because with when you're dealing with 

1419
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:21,291
chemicals,
there's always going to be a small 

1420
01:03:21,291 --> 01:03:21,291
percentage of a chance that your body 
has an adverse reaction.

1421
01:03:21,291 --> 01:03:21,870
Those chemicals,

1422
01:03:22,340 --> 01:03:24,080
and it's not just chemicals.
I mean,

1423
01:03:24,140 --> 01:03:25,190
this is,
these are,

1424
01:03:25,220 --> 01:03:29,150
these are live bacteria,
bacteria and you're listening and immune

1425
01:03:29,151 --> 01:03:31,550
response and immune response is very as 
well,

1426
01:03:32,660 --> 01:03:37,660
dramatically.
I mean some people have autoimmune 

1427
01:03:37,660 --> 01:03:37,660
disease diseases because their immune 
system gets so ramped up.

1428
01:03:37,660 --> 01:03:38,180
I mean,
you know,

1429
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:43,480
some people have type one diabetes 
because their immune system is 

1430
01:03:43,480 --> 01:03:45,140
destroying their pancreatic Beta islet 
cells that produce insulin.

1431
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:48,320
People are different like you said,
and it's funny because when that,

1432
01:03:48,680 --> 01:03:53,680
when Jamie pulled that up,
my mind went to the same place where 

1433
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:53,680
it's,
it's just,

1434
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:57,760
it's the perfect example of how people 
respond differently to different things 

1435
01:03:58,850 --> 01:04:00,300
and you know,
it's not,

1436
01:04:00,390 --> 01:04:03,830
it's not just a chemical but food,
and this is a big,

1437
01:04:03,831 --> 01:04:08,831
big field of inquiry is like the food 
because you've got people battling just 

1438
01:04:08,831 --> 01:04:13,431
like with the vaccine,
people that are anti-vaxxers versus 

1439
01:04:13,431 --> 01:04:13,431
people that want to vaccinate.

1440
01:04:13,431 --> 01:04:15,110
You've got people that are saying 
saturated fat is bad.

1441
01:04:15,111 --> 01:04:16,580
It's good proteins bad.
No,

1442
01:04:16,581 --> 01:04:21,581
it's good.
You've got all these camps of people 

1443
01:04:21,581 --> 01:04:22,700
that all you know are just basically 
like.

1444
01:04:22,701 --> 01:04:24,170
It's almost like a religion where they 
just,

1445
01:04:24,171 --> 01:04:26,330
they know what the best diet isn't.
Everyone should do it.

1446
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:27,980
And,
and the reality is,

1447
01:04:27,981 --> 01:04:31,520
is that it may not be the best diet for 
everyone,

1448
01:04:31,790 --> 01:04:34,160
you know,
and that's something that we all very.

1449
01:04:34,550 --> 01:04:35,720
Yeah,
I mean that's something,

1450
01:04:35,721 --> 01:04:36,290
you know,
so,

1451
01:04:36,500 --> 01:04:40,410
so before the industrialized 
civilization occur,

1452
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:43,070
like occurred,
food was like,

1453
01:04:43,071 --> 01:04:44,840
the food you would eat was,
you know,

1454
01:04:44,841 --> 01:04:46,790
according to where you live 
geographically,

1455
01:04:46,791 --> 01:04:51,791
right?
Because you weren't getting food from 

1456
01:04:51,791 --> 01:04:51,791
all parts of the world,
like you were basically were at whatever

1457
01:04:51,791 --> 01:04:54,080
you could grow and that part of the 
world is what you would eat.

1458
01:04:54,081 --> 01:04:59,081
Right?
And so like people would eat 

1459
01:04:59,081 --> 01:04:59,430
carbohydrates or fats saturated fats or 
you know,

1460
01:04:59,570 --> 01:05:01,090
various foods,
you know,

1461
01:05:01,250 --> 01:05:03,140
different at different rates because 
they were,

1462
01:05:03,260 --> 01:05:04,220
you know,
that's what they had,

1463
01:05:04,221 --> 01:05:04,550
right?

1464
01:05:04,970 --> 01:05:06,650
And it's thought that,
you know,

1465
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:12,320
uh,
over over time that humans have adapted 

1466
01:05:12,320 --> 01:05:15,611
to the,
to the region and they've adapted so 

1467
01:05:15,611 --> 01:05:15,611
that they could process,
you know,

1468
01:05:15,611 --> 01:05:16,940
basically processed that food better.
And at least that's the theory.

1469
01:05:17,170 --> 01:05:20,350
The reality is it doesn't matter how it 
happened.

1470
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:25,500
We know that it's true when people have 
different variations in genes that are 

1471
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:26,710
involved in nutrition and also in 
everything else.

1472
01:05:27,010 --> 01:05:31,000
So regardless of whether or not that's 
how it actually occurred,

1473
01:05:31,001 --> 01:05:32,290
it,
it happens.

1474
01:05:32,650 --> 01:05:37,650
And I think one of the best examples of 
that is the study that was published in 

1475
01:05:37,650 --> 01:05:39,730
2015 in the journal cell from the 
Weizmann Institute.

1476
01:05:39,790 --> 01:05:44,790
800 different people were given a 
continuous glucose monitor where their 

1477
01:05:44,790 --> 01:05:46,330
blood glucose levels were measured every
five minutes.

1478
01:05:46,690 --> 01:05:48,450
And these people were then,
um,

1479
01:05:48,910 --> 01:05:50,490
they submitted samples,
uh,

1480
01:05:50,600 --> 01:05:52,300
for their,
for their DNA to be analyzed.

1481
01:05:52,301 --> 01:05:57,301
And then also their microbiome,
which is the bacteria that live in the 

1482
01:05:57,301 --> 01:05:57,301
gut.

1483
01:05:57,301 --> 01:06:00,190
And so scientists then gave these groups
of people various food types,

1484
01:06:00,410 --> 01:06:03,310
either refined carbohydrate like white 
bread,

1485
01:06:04,060 --> 01:06:05,890
complex carbohydrates,
like,

1486
01:06:05,950 --> 01:06:07,090
you know,
like a banana,

1487
01:06:07,950 --> 01:06:12,950
and then saturated fat like cheese.
And they measured people's Glucose 

1488
01:06:12,950 --> 01:06:15,670
response to these various foods,
800 different people.

1489
01:06:16,540 --> 01:06:21,540
And what was found was that the glucose 
response varied vastly according to a 

1490
01:06:22,571 --> 01:06:25,000
person's genetic and also microbiome 
makeup.

1491
01:06:25,360 --> 01:06:26,740
So people,
you would think,

1492
01:06:26,741 --> 01:06:31,741
well,
people are going to have a high blood 

1493
01:06:31,741 --> 01:06:31,741
glucose response to white bread and 
maybe maybe somewhat to the banana,

1494
01:06:31,741 --> 01:06:33,550
but there's fiber in there.
And that sort of changes the way,

1495
01:06:33,700 --> 01:06:34,170
you know,
the,

1496
01:06:34,171 --> 01:06:35,910
the glucose levels,
um,

1497
01:06:36,550 --> 01:06:37,600
uh,
reach the blood.

1498
01:06:37,601 --> 01:06:42,070
But the reality was that some people had
high blood glucose to the saturated fat,

1499
01:06:42,100 --> 01:06:43,420
which is sort of,
you know,

1500
01:06:43,750 --> 01:06:47,380
not people don't think about that.
I'm so that this is,

1501
01:06:47,381 --> 01:06:52,381
this was sort of like one of the first 
proof of principle studies showing and 

1502
01:06:52,381 --> 01:06:56,041
800 different people that people are 
different and they measured the various 

1503
01:06:56,041 --> 01:06:56,080
genes to show it.

1504
01:06:56,080 --> 01:07:01,080
And also their microbiome,
the gut bacteria varied as well because 

1505
01:07:01,080 --> 01:07:01,080
that changes the way you're metabolizing
food.

1506
01:07:01,080 --> 01:07:01,640
So,
um,

1507
01:07:01,990 --> 01:07:04,180
some of these genes,
like we know,

1508
01:07:04,181 --> 01:07:06,220
we know for example,
Ppr,

1509
01:07:06,340 --> 01:07:07,390
Alpha,
Ppr,

1510
01:07:07,391 --> 01:07:09,370
Gamma Fto,
April before,

1511
01:07:09,490 --> 01:07:14,490
which is what I have all changed the way
your body metabolizes fat and also the 

1512
01:07:17,201 --> 01:07:22,201
way your body transports like fatty 
acids and cholesterol throughout the 

1513
01:07:22,201 --> 01:07:25,141
body.
And the people with some of these 

1514
01:07:25,141 --> 01:07:25,150
polymorphisms in these genes,
if they eat a high,

1515
01:07:25,250 --> 01:07:30,250
you know,
saturated to low poly and mono 

1516
01:07:30,250 --> 01:07:32,881
unsaturated fat ratio,
they can actually have more adverse 

1517
01:07:32,881 --> 01:07:32,881
effects.
They can have higher blood glucose,

1518
01:07:32,881 --> 01:07:36,420
they can have higher ldl cholesterol,
they can have higher obesity rates,

1519
01:07:36,440 --> 01:07:38,410
higher type two diabetes risk,
you know,

1520
01:07:38,411 --> 01:07:40,070
so,
and that's like,

1521
01:07:40,090 --> 01:07:40,870
like I said,
that's,

1522
01:07:40,890 --> 01:07:42,730
that's something that most people that 
were,

1523
01:07:42,790 --> 01:07:45,910
that would eat a high saturated fat diet
wouldn't have.

1524
01:07:46,540 --> 01:07:51,540
And so I've actually been able to look 
at some of my jeans because there's 

1525
01:07:51,540 --> 01:07:51,910
companies now that allow you to do that.

1526
01:07:51,910 --> 01:07:53,230
And um,
so,

1527
01:07:53,640 --> 01:07:55,740
you know,
I know that I have in April before,

1528
01:07:55,750 --> 01:07:59,590
so that changes my,
my diet in a way so you know,

1529
01:07:59,591 --> 01:08:04,591
it because the Aicpa we for not only 
predisposes you to Alzheimer's disease,

1530
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:06,390
um,
and also from um,

1531
01:08:06,910 --> 01:08:11,910
adverse effects to Tbi,
but it also affects the way cholesterol 

1532
01:08:11,910 --> 01:08:13,330
is transporting your body and it doesn't
get recycled very well.

1533
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:18,650
So I have more cholesterol circulating 
in my body at any given point,

1534
01:08:19,150 --> 01:08:21,200
um,
compared to my husband Dan,

1535
01:08:21,201 --> 01:08:24,410
who doesn't have an APP for a little and
we eat the exact same diet,

1536
01:08:24,860 --> 01:08:27,470
like my ldl will be like 20 points 
higher than his,

1537
01:08:27,770 --> 01:08:32,770
you know,
like is there a negative health effect 

1538
01:08:32,770 --> 01:08:37,361
of that?
So that it gets a little more 

1539
01:08:37,361 --> 01:08:37,361
complicated,
but um,

1540
01:08:37,361 --> 01:08:37,410
so the,
the,

1541
01:08:37,420 --> 01:08:42,420
the ldl cholesterol by the way,
for a long time it's been,

1542
01:08:42,500 --> 01:08:47,500
it's been thought to be a predictor of 
heart disease because with nutrition,

1543
01:08:48,171 --> 01:08:53,171
and here's the thing with nutrition is,
is that a lot of our studies are,

1544
01:08:53,360 --> 01:08:58,360
are,
are what's called observational studies 

1545
01:08:58,360 --> 01:08:58,820
where we look at this population and we 
look at a disease risk and we say,

1546
01:08:59,030 --> 01:09:04,030
oh,
this person eat that and they have a 

1547
01:09:04,030 --> 01:09:04,030
higher risk of that or a low risk or 
that.

1548
01:09:04,030 --> 01:09:04,030
Right?
So it's a correlation.

1549
01:09:04,100 --> 01:09:04,850
It's not,
you're not,

1550
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:07,400
you're not showing it's a causal factor,
right.

1551
01:09:07,760 --> 01:09:10,910
It's a correlation.
And it's notoriously like,

1552
01:09:10,911 --> 01:09:14,510
actually my mentor from my Postdoc,
Dr Bruce Ames,

1553
01:09:14,511 --> 01:09:16,620
he has this joke,
that analogy of.

1554
01:09:16,621 --> 01:09:19,610
It's a joke that he tells that really 
illustrates this type of study.

1555
01:09:19,820 --> 01:09:21,310
Epidemiology.
It's,

1556
01:09:21,400 --> 01:09:26,400
it's.
He says that people that are born in 

1557
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:26,400
Miami are born Hispanic,
but they died Jewish.

1558
01:09:26,690 --> 01:09:31,690
So you're born Hispanics and if you 
don't know the rich cultural history of 

1559
01:09:31,690 --> 01:09:35,141
Miami,
whereas a lot of big Latino community 

1560
01:09:35,141 --> 01:09:35,510
people come there from Cuba and various 
races,

1561
01:09:35,990 --> 01:09:39,860
but then old people go there to retire 
because they hate the cold and they want

1562
01:09:39,861 --> 01:09:40,640
to like,
you know,

1563
01:09:40,980 --> 01:09:42,530
you know,
movement move to Florida.

1564
01:09:42,770 --> 01:09:47,770
So you just look at the data.
If you just look at the birth records 

1565
01:09:47,770 --> 01:09:47,770
and the death records,
you'd be like,

1566
01:09:47,770 --> 01:09:52,031
oh,
people are born Hispanic and they die 

1567
01:09:52,031 --> 01:09:52,031
Jewish.
Wow.

1568
01:09:52,031 --> 01:09:53,310
That is epidemiology.
That's like,

1569
01:09:53,390 --> 01:09:54,710
that's very funny.
It is.

1570
01:09:54,740 --> 01:09:59,740
And it's,
it's a great analogy because it really 

1571
01:09:59,740 --> 01:10:00,890
does highlight the complexity of doing 
these types of studies.

1572
01:10:00,891 --> 01:10:02,990
There's all sorts of other factors that 
play a role,

1573
01:10:03,250 --> 01:10:04,860
right?
I mean so.

1574
01:10:05,180 --> 01:10:08,000
So the thing is is that with nutrition 
in particular,

1575
01:10:08,390 --> 01:10:11,300
you have to look at not just the 
epidemiological study,

1576
01:10:11,570 --> 01:10:16,570
but you have to look at controlled 
randomized controlled trials where they 

1577
01:10:16,570 --> 01:10:17,390
use biomarkers as predictors of certain 
diseases.

1578
01:10:17,690 --> 01:10:22,690
You have to look at animal studies where
mechanism has done to understand how 

1579
01:10:22,690 --> 01:10:22,740
things are working.
You know,

1580
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:27,760
you have to look at the whole picture 
because if you just use these studies 

1581
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:27,760
were,
oh,

1582
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:29,330
you get a low protein diet,
it's,

1583
01:10:29,360 --> 01:10:31,430
you have a lower all cause mortality,
boom,

1584
01:10:31,580 --> 01:10:33,050
I'm going to be a Vegan.
Well guess what?

1585
01:10:33,051 --> 01:10:35,140
Lots of other things are complicated.
You know,

1586
01:10:35,141 --> 01:10:40,141
there's,
there's lots of other factors or the 

1587
01:10:40,141 --> 01:10:40,141
saturated fat one.

1588
01:10:40,141 --> 01:10:40,510
So you asked me,
does ldl like,

1589
01:10:40,550 --> 01:10:41,960
does that predict your heart disease 
risk?

1590
01:10:41,961 --> 01:10:45,680
Well on a population level for a long 
time it can.

1591
01:10:45,710 --> 01:10:49,520
Because LDL LDL is,
you know,

1592
01:10:50,060 --> 01:10:55,060
one thing that transports cholesterol 
and higher levels of it have been 

1593
01:10:55,060 --> 01:10:56,840
associated with a variety of different 
heart disease risk factors.

1594
01:10:57,650 --> 01:11:02,650
But the thing is is that as you know,
as time has gone on and tools have got 

1595
01:11:02,650 --> 01:11:04,160
better and when we're able to like look 
more at mechanism,

1596
01:11:04,670 --> 01:11:06,740
scientists have now started to uncover,
oh,

1597
01:11:07,100 --> 01:11:09,710
there's multiple types of ldl.
It's not just one type.

1598
01:11:09,950 --> 01:11:14,040
There's different sizes of it that are 
circulating in the blood and one size

1599
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:15,780
is really good.
The large size,

1600
01:11:15,781 --> 01:11:18,480
the large buoyant size,
it's really good because it's delivering

1601
01:11:18,481 --> 01:11:23,481
cholesterol to yourselves and delivering
fatty acids to yourself where you need 

1602
01:11:23,481 --> 01:11:26,661
it.
Every time you make a new cell in your 

1603
01:11:26,661 --> 01:11:26,661
body,
guess what?

1604
01:11:26,661 --> 01:11:26,661
It needs cholesterol and these fatty 
acids,

1605
01:11:26,661 --> 01:11:29,010
that's great.
But there's also smaller sizes that,

1606
01:11:29,340 --> 01:11:30,160
that,
um,

1607
01:11:30,660 --> 01:11:34,920
that are more dense and basically they 
can't get recycled back to the liver.

1608
01:11:34,921 --> 01:11:35,710
There's a,
there's a,

1609
01:11:36,160 --> 01:11:37,100
uh,
basically a,

1610
01:11:37,150 --> 01:11:39,820
a life cycle of the cholesterol.
It's made in the liver,

1611
01:11:39,821 --> 01:11:44,821
it goes out in the bloodstream,
you donate all this stuff to your 

1612
01:11:44,821 --> 01:11:44,821
various self and it goes back to the 
liver and it's,

1613
01:11:44,821 --> 01:11:45,690
you know,
it's sort of like recycled.

1614
01:11:46,140 --> 01:11:51,140
Well if you can't recycle it then it 
stays in your bloodstream sort of 

1615
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:54,681
indefinitely.
And then it can undergo inflammatory 

1616
01:11:54,681 --> 01:11:54,960
transformations there and all sorts of 
things.

1617
01:11:54,961 --> 01:11:55,950
You know,
bad things happen.

1618
01:11:55,950 --> 01:11:58,140
And so the longer you have something in 
your bloodstream,

1619
01:11:58,141 --> 01:11:59,850
if it's there for,
for,

1620
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:04,880
for like decades,
chances are some shit's going to go 

1621
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:04,880
wrong.
Right?

1622
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:08,631
There's this a dietary issue or a 
hereditary issue in terms of like the 

1623
01:12:08,631 --> 01:12:13,491
size of the ldl.
So I don't know how much is known about 

1624
01:12:13,491 --> 01:12:17,841
the hereditary aspect of it.
It's known that April we for can 

1625
01:12:17,841 --> 01:12:20,700
increase the risk of just having more 
ldl total there.

1626
01:12:20,730 --> 01:12:24,120
Right?
And so what type of Ldl it not known,

1627
01:12:24,121 --> 01:12:29,121
just like regular total ldl,
not looking at the particle size now 

1628
01:12:29,121 --> 01:12:33,350
that particle size,
what we do know is there's a big 

1629
01:12:33,350 --> 01:12:34,410
nutrition factor that regulates that and
the nutrition factor that regulates that

1630
01:12:34,411 --> 01:12:39,411
is refined sugar and that's been shown 
in controlled randomized controlled 

1631
01:12:39,411 --> 01:12:43,881
trials were like healthy men given 
almost like something that was like a 

1632
01:12:43,881 --> 01:12:44,010
soda,
you know?

1633
01:12:44,300 --> 01:12:45,140
Um,
they were,

1634
01:12:45,210 --> 01:12:47,490
they were given a big drink of just 
sugar,

1635
01:12:47,630 --> 01:12:52,630
sugar,
sugary drink for three weeks every day 

1636
01:12:52,630 --> 01:12:55,250
and it completely increase their,
their inflammatory biomarkers for like 

1637
01:12:55,250 --> 01:12:55,250
100 percent.

1638
01:12:55,320 --> 01:12:58,890
But it also ramped up their small ldl 
particle size.

1639
01:12:58,940 --> 01:13:00,870
The limit.
Let me stop right here because this is a

1640
01:13:00,871 --> 01:13:05,871
really important point for people that 
think that drinking a large glass of 

1641
01:13:05,871 --> 01:13:09,390
orange juice is different than drinking 
a glass of soda.

1642
01:13:09,570 --> 01:13:11,220
It's really not.
No,

1643
01:13:11,221 --> 01:13:14,640
it's not because you're not,
you don't have the fiber crazy.

1644
01:13:14,820 --> 01:13:15,690
I mean,
that's crazy.

1645
01:13:15,691 --> 01:13:17,490
If you,
if you say that to most people,

1646
01:13:17,491 --> 01:13:18,540
they're like,
what are you talking about?

1647
01:13:18,541 --> 01:13:19,590
You're talking nonsense.
No,

1648
01:13:20,010 --> 01:13:23,100
if you have a 24 ounce glass of orange 
juice,

1649
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:26,220
you're getting a giant dump of sugar in 
your system.

1650
01:13:26,340 --> 01:13:27,300
Right?
And it's.

1651
01:13:27,460 --> 01:13:29,940
There's many people that think that 
that's a healthy thing to drink,

1652
01:13:30,120 --> 01:13:31,410
right?
And so and that's,

1653
01:13:31,411 --> 01:13:36,411
and that's what complicates all these 
studies is that you then have people 

1654
01:13:36,411 --> 01:13:36,411
eating,
for example,

1655
01:13:36,411 --> 01:13:40,610
saturated fat which is known to increase
the large Ldl ldl.

1656
01:13:40,650 --> 01:13:45,650
It's known to increase that and in 
combination you have people that are 

1657
01:13:45,650 --> 01:13:49,911
drinking orange juice or even worse,
eating cookies and cake and drinking 

1658
01:13:49,911 --> 01:13:51,300
soda and bread,
all that refined carbohydrates stuff.

1659
01:13:51,540 --> 01:13:55,160
Now those two in combination together,
you've got that.

1660
01:13:55,200 --> 01:14:00,200
You've got the Ldl,
and then what happens is with the 

1661
01:14:00,200 --> 01:14:02,961
refined sugar is inflammatory 
transformations happen and you get the 

1662
01:14:02,961 --> 01:14:05,961
small dense and why it's a problem when 
people try to look at Diet and very 

1663
01:14:05,961 --> 01:14:06,570
simplistic ways,
right?

1664
01:14:06,810 --> 01:14:09,390
When people try to say,
if you eat saturated fat,

1665
01:14:09,690 --> 01:14:12,190
if you eat cholesterol,
you're going to have

1666
01:14:12,250 --> 01:14:15,650
high cholesterol in your body and your 
going to have heart attacks,

1667
01:14:15,651 --> 01:14:17,050
they're going to have a stroke.
I mean,

1668
01:14:17,051 --> 01:14:19,930
this is this a very simplistic thing 
that people will often say.

1669
01:14:20,220 --> 01:14:20,840
Yeah,
it is.

1670
01:14:20,860 --> 01:14:21,580
It very,
it,

1671
01:14:21,640 --> 01:14:22,440
it,
it,

1672
01:14:23,190 --> 01:14:24,450
it really,
truly is.

1673
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:25,090
Like I said,
it's,

1674
01:14:25,110 --> 01:14:27,180
you have to look at mechanism,
controlled trials.

1675
01:14:27,181 --> 01:14:30,000
You have to look at observational 
studies are also important.

1676
01:14:30,310 --> 01:14:31,230
Um,
you know,

1677
01:14:31,231 --> 01:14:36,231
we also have looked controlled trials 
where people that are put on a high fat 

1678
01:14:36,231 --> 01:14:39,330
and low refined carbohydrate diet for a 
month or so,

1679
01:14:39,360 --> 01:14:41,160
or something like that.
I don't remember the exact time,

1680
01:14:41,340 --> 01:14:44,040
had all like biomarkers lowered for 
heart disease risk.

1681
01:14:44,390 --> 01:14:47,660
Is there something that people can do to
take on that diet?

1682
01:14:47,690 --> 01:14:52,690
Like how do,
how do you do that if you want to go 

1683
01:14:52,690 --> 01:14:54,701
vegan is.
I know a lot of people will like to be 

1684
01:14:54,701 --> 01:14:57,911
Vegan,
but in order to get all those fats and 

1685
01:14:58,080 --> 01:14:59,570
especially low carbohydrate.

1686
01:15:00,070 --> 01:15:01,960
Well,
so I think that first of all,

1687
01:15:01,961 --> 01:15:06,961
for anyone doing any diet,
like whether it's a Vegan diet or a 

1688
01:15:07,150 --> 01:15:12,150
ketogenic high fat diet or a low carb 
high fat diet or whatever diet they're 

1689
01:15:12,150 --> 01:15:16,651
doing,
first thing you should do is definitely 

1690
01:15:16,651 --> 01:15:19,291
measure these biomarkers.
LDL particle size can be measured 

1691
01:15:19,291 --> 01:15:23,430
triglycerides,
inflammatory biomarkers like high 

1692
01:15:23,430 --> 01:15:23,430
sensitivity,
c reactive protein.

1693
01:15:23,430 --> 01:15:24,760
Where would someone go to do that?
Like what's a good place to go?

1694
01:15:24,890 --> 01:15:26,350
Um,
true health diagnostics.

1695
01:15:26,351 --> 01:15:26,920
I mean,
I don't,

1696
01:15:27,010 --> 01:15:28,480
you,
you can ask your,

1697
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:30,430
your primary care doctor.
Um,

1698
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:33,650
I know truth,
true health diagnostics is one that does

1699
01:15:33,680 --> 01:15:38,680
like whole panel of really good ones,
including the small dense ldl particle 

1700
01:15:38,680 --> 01:15:42,361
size and a growing number of physicians 
do measure Ldl particle size wellness.

1701
01:15:43,421 --> 01:15:48,421
Fx is something if you don't want your 
physician to know what your ldl is 

1702
01:15:48,421 --> 01:15:50,080
because they don't want them to have 
some opinion about it.

1703
01:15:50,140 --> 01:15:55,140
Wellness effects is a company that will 
also measure your ldl particle size and 

1704
01:15:56,141 --> 01:15:59,530
a variety of other biomarkers as well.
Now what you're saying

1705
01:15:59,560 --> 01:16:04,560
about um,
refined carbohydrates or refined sugars 

1706
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:06,940
and Ldl and small Ldl,
Laura,

1707
01:16:07,030 --> 01:16:10,090
large Ldl,
is this common knowledge amongst primary

1708
01:16:10,091 --> 01:16:10,990
care providers?
I mean,

1709
01:16:10,991 --> 01:16:12,970
is this something your doctor's going to
understand?

1710
01:16:13,230 --> 01:16:14,510
Are they going to try to put you on 
standby?

1711
01:16:15,180 --> 01:16:17,230
It's,
it is not ubiquitous.

1712
01:16:17,500 --> 01:16:19,480
It's not standard of care and it's not 
ubiquitous,

1713
01:16:19,540 --> 01:16:20,990
ubiquitous in,
in,

1714
01:16:21,110 --> 01:16:26,110
in the medical profession yet because 
it's just within the past decade have 

1715
01:16:26,730 --> 01:16:31,730
been starting to.
Scientists and researchers have been 

1716
01:16:31,730 --> 01:16:35,221
starting to uncover these mechanisms and
it usually takes a long time to 

1717
01:16:35,221 --> 01:16:40,171
translate this knowledge because now 
large scale clinical trials have to be 

1718
01:16:40,171 --> 01:16:41,110
done in x number of them have to be 
done.

1719
01:16:41,260 --> 01:16:42,130
A lot of,
I don't know,

1720
01:16:42,131 --> 01:16:44,620
everything that goes into how 
regulations are made,

1721
01:16:44,950 --> 01:16:49,950
but it's a lot.
It's a lot of clinical trials and a lot 

1722
01:16:49,950 --> 01:16:50,020
of things before any sort of,
you know,

1723
01:16:50,110 --> 01:16:53,800
regulations are changed.
So that's something that is not standard

1724
01:16:53,801 --> 01:16:56,950
yet.
You can always print out papers,

1725
01:16:58,060 --> 01:16:59,910
give them to your physician.
I interviewed a Guy,

1726
01:17:00,130 --> 01:17:02,200
a guy on my podcast,
he's a cardiologist.

1727
01:17:02,201 --> 01:17:04,240
I'm an md.
[inaudible] name is dr ronald krauss.

1728
01:17:04,241 --> 01:17:09,241
He's actually the guy who pioneered the 
test to measure small dense ldl particle

1729
01:17:09,801 --> 01:17:14,801
size and he's really been a leader in 
the field for understanding the role of 

1730
01:17:15,051 --> 01:17:18,190
small dense ldl particles in 
cardiovascular disease risk and,

1731
01:17:18,410 --> 01:17:23,410
and how basically a person with high ldl
total cholesterol may not actually be at

1732
01:17:24,921 --> 01:17:28,570
risk for heart disease unless you look 
at the actual particle size and,

1733
01:17:28,670 --> 01:17:31,490
and things like this is what confound 
the literature because you can.

1734
01:17:31,730 --> 01:17:34,040
And this is what people often refer to 
as cherry picking.

1735
01:17:34,820 --> 01:17:39,820
It's kind of a pet peeve of mine have 
hand people say that because it's like 

1736
01:17:39,820 --> 01:17:42,310
anyone could do that.
I feel like really the response that 

1737
01:17:42,310 --> 01:17:43,490
someone should say is look at the 
totality of the data,

1738
01:17:43,491 --> 01:17:48,491
look at the clinical trials to look at 
the observational studies looking at 

1739
01:17:48,491 --> 01:17:48,500
mechanism,
look at everything and get the picture.

1740
01:17:48,501 --> 01:17:49,410
Like that's,
that's,

1741
01:17:49,580 --> 01:17:52,010
that's the way you should,
you know,

1742
01:17:52,160 --> 01:17:53,480
approach nutrition,
science.

1743
01:17:53,690 --> 01:17:54,620
So,
um,

1744
01:17:54,890 --> 01:17:59,890
you know,
he's really been a leader in looking at 

1745
01:17:59,890 --> 01:18:01,851
all that.
But I kind of didn't answer your 

1746
01:18:01,851 --> 01:18:02,720
question about the people that are vegan
and want to go eat more of a,

1747
01:18:02,810 --> 01:18:04,730
um,
a high fat,

1748
01:18:04,731 --> 01:18:07,250
low carb diet or even a ketogenic diet.
Right?

1749
01:18:07,670 --> 01:18:08,390
You know,
so that's,

1750
01:18:08,440 --> 01:18:11,420
that's something that they're vegans are
interested in doing as well.

1751
01:18:11,421 --> 01:18:12,710
And you know,
I've never,

1752
01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:14,600
I personally,
um,

1753
01:18:14,720 --> 01:18:19,720
because my ape a background and by the 
way that's kind of what motivated me to 

1754
01:18:19,761 --> 01:18:19,940
get.

1755
01:18:19,940 --> 01:18:24,940
I got super into this new field called 
nutrogenomix interaction between genes 

1756
01:18:24,940 --> 01:18:28,811
and diet because I found out I had this 
illegal and I knew there were sorts of 

1757
01:18:28,811 --> 01:18:30,470
risk and I'm like there's,
there's absolutely things you can do and

1758
01:18:30,471 --> 01:18:32,540
your diet and your lifestyle to modify 
that disease risk.

1759
01:18:32,541 --> 01:18:35,300
And so if that's something that I'm 
really interested in,

1760
01:18:35,740 --> 01:18:37,490
um,
and people can actually,

1761
01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:40,250
you can measure your dna,
but the dna doesn't tell you everything.

1762
01:18:40,251 --> 01:18:43,940
You have to measure blood biomarkers.
Like the blood biomarkers are really key

1763
01:18:43,941 --> 01:18:46,160
to know if a diet it's working for you 
or not.

1764
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:49,490
And if it's not working for you,
like I've had people emailing me,

1765
01:18:49,491 --> 01:18:54,491
they've used,
I have a genetic tool that people can 

1766
01:18:54,491 --> 01:18:54,491
use and if they want to look at april 
before ppr gamma,

1767
01:18:54,491 --> 01:18:55,640
those are like free reports.
They've,

1768
01:18:55,760 --> 01:18:58,700
they've tried to kenogenic diet and it 
was like awful for them.

1769
01:18:59,120 --> 01:19:00,620
Their inflammatory biomarkers went up 
there,

1770
01:19:00,621 --> 01:19:05,621
small dense ldl particle went up,
all this stuff that happened and then 

1771
01:19:05,621 --> 01:19:06,170
they'd use the tool and found out they 
had,

1772
01:19:06,260 --> 01:19:07,280
for example,
the ppa,

1773
01:19:07,281 --> 01:19:12,281
our alpha gene,
which is a gene that's key for the 

1774
01:19:12,281 --> 01:19:14,060
process of ketogenesis producing ketone 
bodies from,

1775
01:19:14,120 --> 01:19:16,360
you know,
from oxidizing fatty acids and,

1776
01:19:16,470 --> 01:19:18,770
and people that have a certain one don't
do it very well.

1777
01:19:18,771 --> 01:19:21,770
And like the diet can be detrimental.
Like it can,

1778
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:24,460
it can do more harm.
That's critical because,

1779
01:19:24,461 --> 01:19:25,250
uh,
you know,

1780
01:19:25,340 --> 01:19:30,340
first of all,
I've been the irresponsibly telling 

1781
01:19:30,340 --> 01:19:30,340
people to do that too.
Like I said,

1782
01:19:30,340 --> 01:19:32,480
I think he'd agentic I responded very 
well to it.

1783
01:19:32,540 --> 01:19:34,830
So I've been telling people to get on a 
record,

1784
01:19:34,900 --> 01:19:35,690
delete,
try it.

1785
01:19:35,810 --> 01:19:38,990
So for what is exactly the gene,
what is the issue?

1786
01:19:39,110 --> 01:19:40,670
So there,
so ppr,

1787
01:19:40,671 --> 01:19:42,500
alpha,
it changes,

1788
01:19:42,650 --> 01:19:46,970
it's a gene that's involved in,
it's involved in fatty acid metabolism,

1789
01:19:47,030 --> 01:19:48,520
absorption of fatty acids.

1790
01:19:48,520 --> 01:19:49,220
Um,
it's also,

1791
01:19:49,230 --> 01:19:54,230
it's in the,
in the liver involved in producing 

1792
01:19:54,230 --> 01:19:54,410
ketone bodies from,
from the fatty acid,

1793
01:19:54,650 --> 01:19:59,650
so that specific gene is essential for 
the process of ketogenesis during a 

1794
01:19:59,650 --> 01:20:04,631
fasted state and also if you're doing a 
ketogenic type of diet and so a certain,

1795
01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:08,010
there are certain variations in that 
gene that don't do it very well.

1796
01:20:08,011 --> 01:20:10,410
And so the high fat diet,
what ends up happening is,

1797
01:20:10,600 --> 01:20:11,430
uh,
you're not,

1798
01:20:11,460 --> 01:20:14,700
you're not metabolizing the fatty acids 
and producing the ketone bodies quite as

1799
01:20:14,701 --> 01:20:16,830
well.
And so you end up having more free fatty

1800
01:20:16,831 --> 01:20:20,610
acids floating around in your 
bloodstream which can antagonize insulin

1801
01:20:20,611 --> 01:20:22,800
receptor and make you more insulin 
insensitive,

1802
01:20:22,801 --> 01:20:25,710
which is exactly the opposite of what 
ketogenic diets really do,

1803
01:20:26,010 --> 01:20:27,510
you know.
So there's this very response.

1804
01:20:27,511 --> 01:20:28,790
You can also,
um,

1805
01:20:29,100 --> 01:20:34,100
have more inflammatory biomarkers for 
various reasons as well because you're 

1806
01:20:34,100 --> 01:20:35,460
not oxidizing the fatty acids and ketone
bodies as well.

1807
01:20:35,460 --> 01:20:37,700
So there's lots of things that change.
But like,

1808
01:20:38,450 --> 01:20:40,800
you know,
knowing the genes is one component.

1809
01:20:40,801 --> 01:20:44,850
I think I think that you have to measure
the biomarkers first and once you,

1810
01:20:45,170 --> 01:20:46,890
you're doing something like a ketogenic 
diet,

1811
01:20:46,891 --> 01:20:51,891
for example,
then you would measure all your lipid 

1812
01:20:51,891 --> 01:20:51,891
particle sizes,
your triglycerides,

1813
01:20:51,891 --> 01:20:54,180
inflammatory biomarkers to want to 
measure hba one c,

1814
01:20:54,181 --> 01:20:59,181
which is your glycated hemoglobin,
which is a marker of sort of your 

1815
01:20:59,181 --> 01:21:03,390
longterm blood glucose levels.
You have one test initially with a 

1816
01:21:03,390 --> 01:21:05,910
baseline test before you enter into.
Exactly.

1817
01:21:06,030 --> 01:21:08,700
That's really key.
Do you think the origins of this is your

1818
01:21:08,701 --> 01:21:13,701
ancestral origins?
Like what your ancestors diet consisted 

1819
01:21:13,701 --> 01:21:13,701
of?
Low fat,

1820
01:21:13,890 --> 01:21:18,890
high carbohydrate.
That's what I was kinda getting at 

1821
01:21:18,890 --> 01:21:18,890
first.
I mean,

1822
01:21:18,890 --> 01:21:18,890
that's the theory at least,
right?

1823
01:21:18,890 --> 01:21:18,890
Like,
we don't,

1824
01:21:18,890 --> 01:21:21,480
we can't prove that,
but that there are scientists looking at

1825
01:21:21,481 --> 01:21:23,460
like different regions,
like people that live,

1826
01:21:23,461 --> 01:21:28,461
for example in northern europe,
how they eat more fat and they're able 

1827
01:21:28,461 --> 01:21:28,461
to do that better.

1828
01:21:28,461 --> 01:21:32,000
And so there are scientists that are 
investigating that because it's 

1829
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:32,070
interesting to know why a,
why that is.

1830
01:21:32,071 --> 01:21:32,640
But yeah,
that's,

1831
01:21:32,670 --> 01:21:34,230
that's the thing that's,
it's.

1832
01:21:34,320 --> 01:21:37,260
And I think it really explains a lot,
like with the ketogenic diet,

1833
01:21:37,620 --> 01:21:38,810
um,
there's,

1834
01:21:38,870 --> 01:21:43,170
it's something that I've become really 
interested in recently because I've been

1835
01:21:43,560 --> 01:21:48,560
following the field and it appears as 
though there is a really,

1836
01:21:49,590 --> 01:21:54,590
um,
there's something about it that is 

1837
01:21:54,590 --> 01:21:54,590
really important for the way your 
mitochondria age.

1838
01:21:54,590 --> 01:21:57,600
Like it really seems to help your 
mitochondria age better.

1839
01:21:57,810 --> 01:21:59,220
And I think that there's,
you know,

1840
01:21:59,221 --> 01:22:00,360
there's multiple,
I talked to,

1841
01:22:00,390 --> 01:22:02,460
uh,
a sort of an expert.

1842
01:22:02,510 --> 01:22:05,310
He is the president of the buck 
institute for research on aging,

1843
01:22:05,730 --> 01:22:07,410
um,
and he,

1844
01:22:07,440 --> 01:22:12,440
his name is eric burdon and he just 
recently published a really big paper 

1845
01:22:12,440 --> 01:22:15,801
showing that in animals,
cyclic ketogenic diets could extend 

1846
01:22:15,801 --> 01:22:16,380
their health span.

1847
01:22:16,380 --> 01:22:18,710
So they are basically healthy part of 
the life they're living.

1848
01:22:19,040 --> 01:22:21,180
They were living longer and they're 
living better and,

1849
01:22:21,190 --> 01:22:26,190
and,
and also their memory was dramatically 

1850
01:22:26,190 --> 01:22:26,190
improved.
And when you say cyclic,

1851
01:22:26,190 --> 01:22:28,620
is there a specific range that your 
cycling.

1852
01:22:28,920 --> 01:22:29,580
So that.
And,

1853
01:22:29,581 --> 01:22:31,410
and this is how these questions for him 
that I,

1854
01:22:31,440 --> 01:22:32,620
that I asked him about,
um,

1855
01:22:33,240 --> 01:22:36,930
and the cyclic.
So it was every other week.

1856
01:22:37,200 --> 01:22:42,200
So one week they were key to genic,
next week they were just getting normal 

1857
01:22:42,200 --> 01:22:42,990
normal chow diet and then ketogenic,
so they're recycling every other week.

1858
01:22:43,410 --> 01:22:47,160
And the reason for that is because for 
whatever reason,

1859
01:22:47,190 --> 01:22:49,080
um,
animals,

1860
01:22:49,081 --> 01:22:51,180
when they just,
when you just give them food to eat,

1861
01:22:51,181 --> 01:22:52,590
like,
like ad lib them,

1862
01:22:52,650 --> 01:22:55,140
like whenever they want,
even if it's ketogenic,

1863
01:22:55,141 --> 01:22:56,370
they'll just,
they'll keep eating,

1864
01:22:56,730 --> 01:22:59,550
like they'll just keep eating it and 
they can become,

1865
01:22:59,670 --> 01:23:01,830
it can become an obesogenic diet where 
there,

1866
01:23:01,890 --> 01:23:06,890
where they become fat and it can 
actually decrease your lifespan even 

1867
01:23:06,890 --> 01:23:06,890
though it's key to genic.

1868
01:23:06,890 --> 01:23:09,730
And I think that's partly because fatty 
acids,

1869
01:23:09,770 --> 01:23:11,860
um,
in order to use them,

1870
01:23:11,950 --> 01:23:16,210
they have to get inside the mitochondria
to be used and that energy.

1871
01:23:16,211 --> 01:23:17,800
And if they don't get inside the 
mitochondria,

1872
01:23:17,980 --> 01:23:22,300
then they just get taken up into adipose
tissue and stored as fat and fatty acids

1873
01:23:22,301 --> 01:23:25,450
themselves will,
when the levels are high enough,

1874
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:28,060
shut that transport system that does 
that off.

1875
01:23:28,330 --> 01:23:33,330
So it's like a negative regulator.
So if you just keep on bombarding the 

1876
01:23:33,330 --> 01:23:33,330
body with fat,
fat,

1877
01:23:33,330 --> 01:23:33,330
fat,
fat,

1878
01:23:33,330 --> 01:23:35,170
fat,
like nonstop without a rest,

1879
01:23:35,560 --> 01:23:40,560
then you start to like not be able to 
use those fatty acids because it 

1880
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:41,910
inhibits the transport system.
It's called the karnataka,

1881
01:23:41,920 --> 01:23:44,550
pama.
Total transfer is for those nerdy,

1882
01:23:44,580 --> 01:23:46,520
nerdy biologist geeks out there,
um,

1883
01:23:46,770 --> 01:23:47,410
that,
that,

1884
01:23:47,430 --> 01:23:48,370
you know.
So anyways,

1885
01:23:49,030 --> 01:23:51,040
I totally digress tigress there.
But,

1886
01:23:51,041 --> 01:23:52,780
um,
it's um,

1887
01:23:53,470 --> 01:23:54,340
uh,
yeah,

1888
01:23:54,341 --> 01:23:59,341
the cycle can inject dye so that,
that was something that extended their 

1889
01:23:59,341 --> 01:23:59,341
health span and I became very interested
in that.

1890
01:23:59,341 --> 01:24:04,260
And so the thing that's super 
interesting and as I was talking to dr 

1891
01:24:04,260 --> 01:24:04,960
budin about this is that,
you know,

1892
01:24:05,020 --> 01:24:06,190
there's a couple of things.
One,

1893
01:24:06,191 --> 01:24:10,900
obviously you're not getting a lot of 
blood glucose hits all the time,

1894
01:24:10,901 --> 01:24:11,530
right?
When,

1895
01:24:11,770 --> 01:24:16,770
for the most part,
if you don't have gene polymorphisms 

1896
01:24:16,770 --> 01:24:16,770
that are changing the way you process 
saturated fat,

1897
01:24:16,770 --> 01:24:17,560
right?
So you're not your,

1898
01:24:17,590 --> 01:24:22,590
your,
your insulin response is not happening 

1899
01:24:22,590 --> 01:24:22,590
quite as often.
That's lowered and there's,

1900
01:24:22,590 --> 01:24:23,170
there's,
there's benefits with from that alone,

1901
01:24:23,171 --> 01:24:26,320
right?
But for someone like me that doesn't eat

1902
01:24:26,321 --> 01:24:28,960
refined sugar,
doesn't eat any refined carbohydrates.

1903
01:24:28,961 --> 01:24:33,961
I mean,
all of my carbohydrates come from leafy 

1904
01:24:33,961 --> 01:24:34,420
greens or,
or vegetables and berries and some,

1905
01:24:34,690 --> 01:24:35,950
some,
some other fruits,

1906
01:24:36,010 --> 01:24:37,090
um,
you know,

1907
01:24:37,091 --> 01:24:42,091
so,
and my blood glucose levels have always 

1908
01:24:42,091 --> 01:24:42,091
been pretty,
pretty good,

1909
01:24:42,091 --> 01:24:43,500
like fasting blood glucose and all that.
Um,

1910
01:24:43,900 --> 01:24:46,210
with the exception of my lack of sleep 
recently in,

1911
01:24:46,380 --> 01:24:49,610
you know,
but so the question I wanted to know was

1912
01:24:49,611 --> 01:24:49,990
like,
okay,

1913
01:24:49,991 --> 01:24:51,760
well,
what else is going on?

1914
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:55,570
And it seems as though the production of
the major circulating ketone body,

1915
01:24:55,571 --> 01:25:00,571
beta hydroxybutyrate really is having an
anti aging role and you know,

1916
01:25:01,690 --> 01:25:03,650
dr dan's work show that it,
it's,

1917
01:25:03,680 --> 01:25:07,330
it's changing the expression of genes 
and it's like activating longevity genes

1918
01:25:07,331 --> 01:25:09,460
and all this.
But the thing that's super,

1919
01:25:09,461 --> 01:25:14,461
super interesting to me is that the way 
it's metabolized by mitochondria is 

1920
01:25:14,770 --> 01:25:19,770
different than other energy sources.
And without getting too much into 

1921
01:25:19,770 --> 01:25:21,400
chemistry,
it's not,

1922
01:25:21,460 --> 01:25:23,710
um,
in order to produce energy,

1923
01:25:23,711 --> 01:25:26,100
you have to use something called 
electron reducing equivalents.

1924
01:25:26,140 --> 01:25:31,140
And they can be in the form of nad nadh 
ratio or fad to agent.

1925
01:25:32,890 --> 01:25:37,890
So it's not going through one of those 
pathways that generates more free 

1926
01:25:37,890 --> 01:25:39,070
radicals.
And we're basically leaky electrons that

1927
01:25:39,071 --> 01:25:41,530
can damage mitochondria,
it doesn't go through that pathway,

1928
01:25:41,531 --> 01:25:46,000
like other energy sources.
So it's like you end up net not,

1929
01:25:46,300 --> 01:25:47,560
not,
you know,

1930
01:25:47,561 --> 01:25:52,561
basically having lower,
lower inflammatory and lower oxidative 

1931
01:25:52,561 --> 01:25:52,561
damage.
Your mitochondria.

1932
01:25:52,561 --> 01:25:54,910
It also doesn't have what's called 
proton proton,

1933
01:25:54,911 --> 01:25:58,120
a fork activity.
So it's almost like the way your body,

1934
01:25:58,121 --> 01:26:02,290
your mitochondrial metabolizing it is 
better because metabolism,

1935
01:26:02,291 --> 01:26:04,310
you're constantly generating damage,

1936
01:26:04,670 --> 01:26:09,670
like damaged constantly.
Right now all the time it's just from 

1937
01:26:09,670 --> 01:26:10,310
normal metabolism.
And it seems as though there's something

1938
01:26:10,311 --> 01:26:14,540
about that beta hydroxybutyrate that's 
superior and it's,

1939
01:26:14,541 --> 01:26:19,541
it's,
it's definitely gotten me super 

1940
01:26:19,541 --> 01:26:19,541
interested in it.
And you know,

1941
01:26:19,541 --> 01:26:23,411
for,
for like the longest time I was 

1942
01:26:23,411 --> 01:26:23,411
thinking,
well I'll get my beta hydroxybutyrate by

1943
01:26:23,411 --> 01:26:27,770
doing time restricted eating right.
Or I'm eating all my food within like 10

1944
01:26:27,771 --> 01:26:29,090
hours.
And then I'm,

1945
01:26:29,140 --> 01:26:32,060
I'm fasting for 14 hours and I'm,
you know,

1946
01:26:32,450 --> 01:26:37,450
depending on how active,
what your activity levels are and all 

1947
01:26:37,450 --> 01:26:37,450
that,
how quickly you deplete your liver,

1948
01:26:37,450 --> 01:26:41,800
liver glycogen,
you can start to make beta 

1949
01:26:41,800 --> 01:26:41,800
hydroxybutyrate even within like seven 
hours if you're really active,

1950
01:26:41,990 --> 01:26:42,740
you know.
So I was like,

1951
01:26:42,741 --> 01:26:45,710
well I'm getting my beta beta 
hydroxybutyrate from the fasting part of

1952
01:26:45,711 --> 01:26:49,700
the time restricted eating right.
But I've become super interested in,

1953
01:26:50,120 --> 01:26:55,120
in this possible even because there's 
other reasons I don't eat a ketogenic 

1954
01:26:55,120 --> 01:26:55,120
diet.

1955
01:26:55,120 --> 01:26:58,610
I like to get all the micronutrients.
I like to get prebiotic fiber,

1956
01:26:58,850 --> 01:27:03,850
you know,
that's really good for the gut 

1957
01:27:03,850 --> 01:27:03,850
microbiome.
But then again I don't,

1958
01:27:03,850 --> 01:27:05,840
we don't know exactly how ketogenic 
diets even effecting the microbiome.

1959
01:27:05,841 --> 01:27:08,240
So that's sort of still an open,
you know,

1960
01:27:08,241 --> 01:27:09,980
open fields.
So I,

1961
01:27:10,090 --> 01:27:12,530
I'm sort of thinking can I do some sort 
of cyclic,

1962
01:27:12,590 --> 01:27:17,590
you know,
cogenic die and also for me because I 

1963
01:27:17,590 --> 01:27:18,080
have april before I do eat saturated 
fat,

1964
01:27:18,081 --> 01:27:20,990
but I eat it from like whole foods I 
don't like.

1965
01:27:20,991 --> 01:27:25,991
I used to do a lot of cooking with 
coconut oil which is high in saturated 

1966
01:27:25,991 --> 01:27:28,781
fat.
And I'm like what do I need to do that 

1967
01:27:28,781 --> 01:27:30,671
for?
Like I don't really need to cook with 

1968
01:27:30,671 --> 01:27:30,671
coconut oil.
I can use avocado oil,

1969
01:27:30,671 --> 01:27:34,420
you know?
And so I changed that and my ldl just 

1970
01:27:34,420 --> 01:27:34,910
dropped 20 points from just that alone,
you know.

1971
01:27:34,910 --> 01:27:39,910
So it's like,
and what it will with large versus 

1972
01:27:39,910 --> 01:27:39,910
small?
Yeah,

1973
01:27:39,910 --> 01:27:41,390
my ldl overall,
the first time.

1974
01:27:41,391 --> 01:27:46,391
So my baseline,
I didn't measure small dents so I don't 

1975
01:27:46,391 --> 01:27:46,580
know what my baseline was,
but I did measure the large,

1976
01:27:46,640 --> 01:27:51,640
so the large and like I said,
the large can transform into the small 

1977
01:27:51,640 --> 01:27:54,620
events and so with,
with refined sugars,

1978
01:27:54,680 --> 01:27:55,910
with refined sugars,
that's what's.

1979
01:27:55,911 --> 01:27:57,560
No,
but like you mentioned genetics,

1980
01:27:57,561 --> 01:27:59,630
there may be something that we don't 
know.

1981
01:27:59,960 --> 01:28:04,960
What is the mechanism for the 
transference of the sugar with the ldl?

1982
01:28:05,410 --> 01:28:07,940
Like w what?
What causes it to become small?

1983
01:28:07,941 --> 01:28:10,610
Dense.
I'm not sure we entirely understand that

1984
01:28:10,611 --> 01:28:15,611
yet just because it's definitely a 
correlation in their head and it has 

1985
01:28:15,611 --> 01:28:19,151
been shown in clinical studies to,
to not just be correlation but causal 

1986
01:28:19,151 --> 01:28:19,280
where you give people refined sugar and 
they're.

1987
01:28:19,330 --> 01:28:21,070
They're small dental school.
Yeah,

1988
01:28:21,230 --> 01:28:22,640
same diet,
same diet,

1989
01:28:22,641 --> 01:28:24,320
adding refined sugar.

1990
01:28:24,380 --> 01:28:27,410
You see a radical difference.
You measure their small dense ldl before

1991
01:28:27,411 --> 01:28:29,060
giving them the refined sugars,
same diet,

1992
01:28:29,240 --> 01:28:34,240
and then you measure after the soda 
blast of refined sugar for three weeks 

1993
01:28:34,240 --> 01:28:38,981
and they're small,
dense ldl particles going through the 

1994
01:28:38,981 --> 01:28:41,111
roof.
So that's causal because you're giving 

1995
01:28:41,111 --> 01:28:43,301
them something,
you're measuring it before and after 

1996
01:28:43,301 --> 01:28:45,220
effect,
and if there's anything that we can 

1997
01:28:45,220 --> 01:28:47,410
conclusively point too,
it's that refined sugar is absolutely 

1998
01:28:47,410 --> 01:28:48,800
bad for you.
There's no doubt about that,

1999
01:28:48,801 --> 01:28:49,270
right?
I,

2000
01:28:49,330 --> 01:28:50,630
I think so.
I think that,

2001
01:28:50,631 --> 01:28:53,450
you know,
there's so many studies that have shown,

2002
01:28:53,480 --> 01:28:55,400
you know,
the inflammatory biomarkers go up,

2003
01:28:55,430 --> 01:28:59,210
your small dense ldl biomarkers go up.
There's correlation studies showing that

2004
01:28:59,211 --> 01:29:01,990
people that eat refined sugar have like 
tila

2005
01:29:01,990 --> 01:29:06,990
mirrors,
which are a biomarker for aging that 

2006
01:29:06,990 --> 01:29:06,990
looked 10 years older.
You know,

2007
01:29:06,990 --> 01:29:10,371
even though people,
they're the same chronological age is 

2008
01:29:10,371 --> 01:29:10,371
other people that don't eat the refined 
sugar.

2009
01:29:10,371 --> 01:29:14,480
There's studies and men would like,
they give men 75 grams of refined sugar 

2010
01:29:14,480 --> 01:29:15,810
and their testosterone drops by 25 
percent.

2011
01:29:15,840 --> 01:29:20,840
I mean,
it's changing a lot of things in the 

2012
01:29:20,840 --> 01:29:20,840
body in a negative way.

2013
01:29:20,840 --> 01:29:21,260
Well,
mine,

2014
01:29:21,261 --> 01:29:24,290
my testosterone doubled when I changed 
my diet.

2015
01:29:24,320 --> 01:29:29,320
When I cut out the pasta,
when I cut out the bread and I started 

2016
01:29:29,320 --> 01:29:30,590
eating more saturated fat,
more protein,

2017
01:29:30,591 --> 01:29:35,591
and I went to the ketogenic diet,
literally a doubled doing everything 

2018
01:29:35,591 --> 01:29:40,091
exactly the same.
It was stunning and I felt different 

2019
01:29:40,091 --> 01:29:42,050
like I can feel the difference,
feel the difference in my energy levels,

2020
01:29:42,051 --> 01:29:43,790
feel a difference.
Cognitively.

2021
01:29:43,791 --> 01:29:48,791
The cognitive thing was a big thing and 
I attributed it to cutting out refined 

2022
01:29:48,791 --> 01:29:49,200
sugars and refined carbohydrates.
I think.

2023
01:29:49,550 --> 01:29:50,690
I think that stuff's poison.

2024
01:29:51,050 --> 01:29:56,050
Well,
there's been studies showing it also 

2025
01:29:56,050 --> 01:29:56,050
affects your brain and negative way as 
well,

2026
01:29:56,050 --> 01:29:56,610
and people that eat refined sugar,
you know,

2027
01:29:56,611 --> 01:29:58,060
there's,
there's more brain atrophy.

2028
01:29:58,061 --> 01:29:59,380
I mean,
there's lots of correlations.

2029
01:29:59,830 --> 01:30:01,930
The one thing I will say is that,
you know,

2030
01:30:02,200 --> 01:30:07,200
there are people that are super 
physically active and they're like 

2031
01:30:07,200 --> 01:30:07,200
working out two hours a day and you 
know,

2032
01:30:07,200 --> 01:30:09,700
those guys,
they all use refined sugar.

2033
01:30:10,940 --> 01:30:11,640
Yeah.
To,

2034
01:30:11,641 --> 01:30:12,140
you know,
their,

2035
01:30:12,170 --> 01:30:14,660
their increased transport glucose 
transporter,

2036
01:30:14,700 --> 01:30:18,430
their muscles and are using it as an 
anabolic way to like get bigger muscle.

2037
01:30:18,431 --> 01:30:20,980
And I know guys who do that after they 
work out the candy.

2038
01:30:21,160 --> 01:30:21,870
Yeah,
I'm and,

2039
01:30:21,940 --> 01:30:23,810
and it,
it's not like it's,

2040
01:30:23,850 --> 01:30:28,850
it's.
You can't compare like people that 

2041
01:30:28,850 --> 01:30:28,850
aren't working out like two hours a day 
or you know,

2042
01:30:28,850 --> 01:30:30,440
like that to normal people.
Raymond,

2043
01:30:30,610 --> 01:30:32,980
sedentary weightlifters,
weightlifters,

2044
01:30:33,060 --> 01:30:33,190
yes.

2045
01:30:33,220 --> 01:30:35,560
Folded or just ripping their body apart 
there.

2046
01:30:35,770 --> 01:30:40,060
I mean there's a lot of savages out 
there that are doing crazy power lifting

2047
01:30:40,061 --> 01:30:45,061
workouts and benching and squatting and 
I know a lot of guys who like to eat 

2048
01:30:45,061 --> 01:30:45,220
candy afterwards,

2049
01:30:45,260 --> 01:30:45,890
right?
Yeah.

2050
01:30:45,950 --> 01:30:46,410
No,
it's,

2051
01:30:46,420 --> 01:30:47,870
it's certainly,
you know,

2052
01:30:47,871 --> 01:30:50,480
I think that those people,
you know,

2053
01:30:50,860 --> 01:30:52,060
they're,
they're not,

2054
01:30:52,170 --> 01:30:53,990
it's not,
it's not acting the same way,

2055
01:30:54,400 --> 01:30:57,080
be different requirements that their 
body needs in terms of glucose.

2056
01:30:57,680 --> 01:31:02,680
And the thing is,
I mean still it's like the way I think 

2057
01:31:02,680 --> 01:31:02,680
about it is it's not really nutrient 
dense,

2058
01:31:02,680 --> 01:31:02,680
you know?
I like to like,

2059
01:31:02,940 --> 01:31:04,160
I'm like,
well there's lots of.

2060
01:31:04,180 --> 01:31:05,300
There's reasons.
Yeah,

2061
01:31:05,390 --> 01:31:10,390
there's a reason why I like to like take
it if you want the sugar and eat an 

2062
01:31:10,390 --> 01:31:10,800
orange or an apple or something like 
that,

2063
01:31:10,801 --> 01:31:12,980
or you should probably the better move 
than eaten candy,

2064
01:31:12,981 --> 01:31:13,310
but I think

2065
01:31:13,320 --> 01:31:15,450
they just want a ton of it.
And what is the,

2066
01:31:15,480 --> 01:31:20,480
what's the anabolic factor?
Like if you were going to eat candy or 

2067
01:31:20,480 --> 01:31:23,691
something like that,
has a bunch of refined sugar after like 

2068
01:31:23,691 --> 01:31:23,970
an intense workout.
What would be the anabolic effect?

2069
01:31:24,080 --> 01:31:24,860
Well,
the glucose,

2070
01:31:24,890 --> 01:31:29,890
so the,
the workout causes glucose transporters 

2071
01:31:29,890 --> 01:31:33,731
that transport glucose to like go 
through the roof and so you start the 

2072
01:31:33,731 --> 01:31:34,940
glucose from your bloodstream,
gets sucked into the muscle,

2073
01:31:35,120 --> 01:31:36,770
and then in the muscle,
you know,

2074
01:31:36,771 --> 01:31:37,880
you're,
you're basically,

2075
01:31:37,881 --> 01:31:39,280
you can,
you can use that as,

2076
01:31:39,281 --> 01:31:40,220
as,
as a way to,

2077
01:31:40,270 --> 01:31:42,350
to,
to have insulin and it can be anabolic,

2078
01:31:42,351 --> 01:31:43,040
right?
Where,

2079
01:31:43,450 --> 01:31:47,060
where whereas if you weren't doing that,
then the glucose in your bloodstream and

2080
01:31:47,061 --> 01:31:52,061
it can also tip small dense ldl 
particles can start to form because the 

2081
01:31:52,061 --> 01:31:53,690
inflammatory transformations that 
happened and things like that,

2082
01:31:54,530 --> 01:31:59,530
that's at least my understanding that's 
in combination of course with amino 

2083
01:31:59,530 --> 01:32:01,090
acids which are also important for the 
growth of the protein and muscle.

2084
01:32:01,091 --> 01:32:02,170
But um,

2085
01:32:02,580 --> 01:32:04,170
my understanding of it,
I think.

2086
01:32:04,800 --> 01:32:09,800
So in general though,
if someone could cut one thing out of 

2087
01:32:10,621 --> 01:32:14,790
their diet,
refined carbohydrates and refined sugars

2088
01:32:14,791 --> 01:32:17,040
would be a great way to go.
I think the one,

2089
01:32:17,070 --> 01:32:22,070
if you were to think about the one 
easiest thing that you could do that 

2090
01:32:22,070 --> 01:32:22,950
would have the biggest impact on your 
health.

2091
01:32:23,570 --> 01:32:24,870
And if you're talking,
if we're talking about,

2092
01:32:25,290 --> 01:32:27,630
we're not talking about someone who's 
already paleo or someone like,

2093
01:32:27,631 --> 01:32:32,631
you're right,
we're talking about standard american 

2094
01:32:32,631 --> 01:32:32,631
person.
Yes.

2095
01:32:32,631 --> 01:32:35,430
The one thing that they could do to have
the biggest impact on their health,

2096
01:32:35,490 --> 01:32:37,590
I would say,
is to cut out refined sugar.

2097
01:32:38,060 --> 01:32:41,760
Like that's probably the biggest thing.
The easiest thing.

2098
01:32:41,900 --> 01:32:44,040
I mean,
I don't know how easy it is,

2099
01:32:44,060 --> 01:32:47,310
you know,
it can be addicted and that's been shown

2100
01:32:47,311 --> 01:32:48,440
dopamine levels,
you know,

2101
01:32:48,480 --> 01:32:50,940
can get activated and that it's also 
your gut biome.

2102
01:32:50,941 --> 01:32:51,710
Correct?
Right.

2103
01:32:51,760 --> 01:32:55,440
Your gut biome literally has an impact 
on what you desire,

2104
01:32:55,540 --> 01:32:56,220
right?
Yeah,

2105
01:32:56,221 --> 01:32:57,240
it does.
So you're,

2106
01:32:57,241 --> 01:32:59,790
you're the,
the thing about your microbiome and your

2107
01:32:59,791 --> 01:33:01,620
gut is that like,
you know,

2108
01:33:01,650 --> 01:33:02,530
the,
the,

2109
01:33:02,560 --> 01:33:05,970
the microbiome eats,
it's at the distal part of your gut.

2110
01:33:05,971 --> 01:33:08,340
So it's in the colon,
the large intestine,

2111
01:33:08,341 --> 01:33:13,341
the very end of the large intestine is 
where most of the trillions of bacteria 

2112
01:33:13,341 --> 01:33:17,451
are.
And those bacteria actually eat the 

2113
01:33:17,451 --> 01:33:18,720
fermentable fiber that we don't digest.
We don't,

2114
01:33:18,780 --> 01:33:23,780
we don't process.
And the fermentable fiber comes from a 

2115
01:33:23,780 --> 01:33:24,270
variety of plants,
from,

2116
01:33:24,480 --> 01:33:26,970
from plants,
and from seeds and nuts.

2117
01:33:26,971 --> 01:33:30,640
And you know,
I'm like qms as well,

2118
01:33:30,760 --> 01:33:31,910
uh,
you know,

2119
01:33:31,920 --> 01:33:36,920
so there's different types of 
fermentable fiber that are found in 

2120
01:33:36,920 --> 01:33:37,530
different types of foods and they feed 
different species of bacteria.

2121
01:33:38,310 --> 01:33:43,310
Well,
when you don't get enough of that 

2122
01:33:43,310 --> 01:33:43,310
fermentable fiber,
what ends up happening,

2123
01:33:43,310 --> 01:33:48,081
in fact,
there's been studies showing that 75 

2124
01:33:48,081 --> 01:33:48,081
percent of the microbiome population 
changes.

2125
01:33:48,081 --> 01:33:51,300
And like when,
when you don't get at all any fiber,

2126
01:33:51,630 --> 01:33:52,920
and what happens,
a couple of things,

2127
01:33:52,921 --> 01:33:53,870
one is those,
mike,

2128
01:33:53,910 --> 01:33:56,070
those bacteria species,
they start to eat,

2129
01:33:56,530 --> 01:34:01,530
um,
the carbohydrate that's lining your gut 

2130
01:34:01,530 --> 01:34:04,131
called mucin,
which is what makes up the gut barrier 

2131
01:34:04,131 --> 01:34:04,140
that separates the immune cells in your 
gut from the bacteria.

2132
01:34:04,470 --> 01:34:05,900
They start to eat it because it's 
carbohydrate.

2133
01:34:06,200 --> 01:34:09,570
And so you actually start to break down 
your gut barrier just from that.

2134
01:34:09,930 --> 01:34:14,930
The second thing that happens is what 
you mentioned is that a lot of the 

2135
01:34:14,930 --> 01:34:15,930
pathogenic bacteria will swim up to the 
small intestine where they're really not

2136
01:34:15,931 --> 01:34:20,931
supposed to be.
Small intestine is where you absorb 

2137
01:34:20,931 --> 01:34:20,931
sugar.
Protein,

2138
01:34:20,931 --> 01:34:21,960
fats,
this warmup there,

2139
01:34:21,980 --> 01:34:26,980
and guess what sugar they start,
so they start to like eat the sugar and 

2140
01:34:27,091 --> 01:34:32,091
they start to multiply.
And the thing about having bacteria in 

2141
01:34:32,091 --> 01:34:32,091
the small intestine where it's not 
supposed to be,

2142
01:34:32,280 --> 01:34:35,030
is that it causes the same response 
that,

2143
01:34:35,300 --> 01:34:38,630
that eating gluten causes,
where it basically those,

2144
01:34:38,631 --> 01:34:40,470
those,
it's called small bacteria,

2145
01:34:40,471 --> 01:34:41,760
intestinal overgrowth.

2146
01:34:42,120 --> 01:34:47,120
And what happens is that the tight 
junctions that make up the gut barrier 

2147
01:34:47,120 --> 01:34:51,410
starts to open up and open up and that 
allows the inflammatory immune cells to 

2148
01:34:51,931 --> 01:34:56,931
be in contact with bacteria.
And of course the immune cells go 

2149
01:34:56,931 --> 01:35:00,170
bacteria and they started to like try to
kill it because they think this not 

2150
01:35:00,170 --> 01:35:02,520
supposed to be there.
It could be potentially harmful 

2151
01:35:02,520 --> 01:35:05,230
pathogenic bacteria.
And so that starts to set off an immune 

2152
01:35:05,230 --> 01:35:05,330
response,
inflammatory immune response.

2153
01:35:05,660 --> 01:35:07,820
And the more you have,
the more sugar you eat,

2154
01:35:07,850 --> 01:35:11,240
the more your population of bacteria is 
flourishing.

2155
01:35:11,630 --> 01:35:13,100
So,
so that's like,

2156
01:35:13,250 --> 01:35:14,720
that's another thing that's,
that's,

2157
01:35:14,721 --> 01:35:16,130
um,
that's changing that.

2158
01:35:16,131 --> 01:35:19,960
But it's also the one of the reasons,
like I was saying with um,

2159
01:35:20,440 --> 01:35:22,310
and I've never actually tried a 
ketogenetic diet,

2160
01:35:22,760 --> 01:35:23,470
but,
um,

2161
01:35:23,900 --> 01:35:24,890
because,
you know,

2162
01:35:25,280 --> 01:35:26,840
for various reasons,
but I,

2163
01:35:26,880 --> 01:35:30,560
I'm not sure how much plants you eat,
like what,

2164
01:35:30,620 --> 01:35:33,610
like can you eat like a good amount of,
can you get like some roots,

2165
01:35:33,640 --> 01:35:37,060
depends on the individual on a very 
small scale.

2166
01:35:37,110 --> 01:35:42,110
Uh,
robb wolf and his wife have done some 

2167
01:35:42,110 --> 01:35:42,340
pretty interesting tasks where they'll 
both eat the same thing and they'll both

2168
01:35:42,341 --> 01:35:44,410
tests themselves.
He'll test the,

2169
01:35:44,411 --> 01:35:45,280
both of them,
you know,

2170
01:35:45,281 --> 01:35:50,281
x amount of minutes later and they have 
a radically different response between 

2171
01:35:50,281 --> 01:35:50,281
the two of them.
It's really interesting.

2172
01:35:50,281 --> 01:35:54,960
Like his wife is much more resilient and
he has much more of a difficult time 

2173
01:35:54,960 --> 01:35:55,340
getting back into ketosis.
It's real,

2174
01:35:55,380 --> 01:35:57,960
it's real.
He's just documented a lot of it on his,

2175
01:35:57,980 --> 01:35:59,560
um,
his instagram page.

2176
01:35:59,561 --> 01:36:04,561
But I think it speaks to what you were 
talking about before that it really 

2177
01:36:04,561 --> 01:36:06,580
depends on where your ancestors evolved 
and really has.

2178
01:36:06,581 --> 01:36:09,940
There's different.
We very biologically so much

2179
01:36:10,250 --> 01:36:11,150
right?
We do.

2180
01:36:11,151 --> 01:36:16,151
And that's,
that that affects how we respond to 

2181
01:36:16,151 --> 01:36:16,151
these foods and all that,
you know.

2182
01:36:16,151 --> 01:36:17,930
But um,
anyways,

2183
01:36:17,931 --> 01:36:20,060
uh,
what was the other thing I wanted to ask

2184
01:36:20,061 --> 01:36:20,960
you about?
Oh,

2185
01:36:20,961 --> 01:36:25,961
the nad to remember the nad I was 
talking about like the nad and nadh 

2186
01:36:26,181 --> 01:36:28,460
ratio in ned.
So this is something,

2187
01:36:29,150 --> 01:36:30,380
what does that add stand for?
Again,

2188
01:36:30,870 --> 01:36:34,400
nicotinamide attending die nucleotide 
and it's something,

2189
01:36:34,490 --> 01:36:36,110
it's something that,
um,

2190
01:36:36,860 --> 01:36:41,860
it's kind of in a way similar to atp 
where it's used as an energetic currency

2191
01:36:43,101 --> 01:36:44,870
throughout the body for,
for,

2192
01:36:44,900 --> 01:36:49,900
for various things,
but it's actually required to like 

2193
01:36:49,900 --> 01:36:53,860
forgive metabolism,
like you need it to metabolize fatty 

2194
01:36:53,860 --> 01:36:57,860
acids and glucose and amino acids,
but you also,

2195
01:36:57,890 --> 01:37:02,890
you need it to repair damage.
You need it for a variety of other 

2196
01:37:02,890 --> 01:37:05,360
things that are happening.
And the thing is,

2197
01:37:05,361 --> 01:37:10,361
is that these nad levels in tissues that
are very energetically demanding,

2198
01:37:11,600 --> 01:37:12,470
they deplete.

2199
01:37:12,470 --> 01:37:13,540
So for example,
if you're immune,

2200
01:37:13,580 --> 01:37:17,150
if you have chronic inflammation and 
your immune system's chronic chronically

2201
01:37:17,151 --> 01:37:19,730
being activated,
the nad levels are going to that.

2202
01:37:19,731 --> 01:37:24,731
And it's kinda like triaging.
And so what happens is your metabolism 

2203
01:37:24,731 --> 01:37:28,001
suffers and it's been shown now that nad
levels in like multiple tissues with 

2204
01:37:29,780 --> 01:37:30,920
age,
they deplete.

2205
01:37:31,310 --> 01:37:36,310
Lots of preclinical studies have shown 
that it plays a role in the aging 

2206
01:37:36,310 --> 01:37:37,070
process.
And if you,

2207
01:37:37,071 --> 01:37:39,860
for example,
take like a mouse that has progeria this

2208
01:37:39,920 --> 01:37:44,920
pro aging phenotype,
and then you give them the nad it like 

2209
01:37:44,920 --> 01:37:48,071
can like basically kind of rescue that 
in a way and they like live a more 

2210
01:37:48,071 --> 01:37:48,710
normal health span and more normal 
lifespan.

2211
01:37:48,980 --> 01:37:50,870
So it's like,
and there's lots of studies showing that

2212
01:37:50,960 --> 01:37:55,960
in various ways there's recently been a 
lot of interest in it because the nad 

2213
01:37:56,430 --> 01:38:01,430
there's a way to replenish it through 
supplemental form called nicotinamide 

2214
01:38:01,430 --> 01:38:01,430
riboside.

2215
01:38:01,430 --> 01:38:04,230
So nad is actually formed from vitamin b
three,

2216
01:38:04,231 --> 01:38:09,150
like nicotinic acid or nicotinamide,
or from tryptofan.

2217
01:38:09,690 --> 01:38:11,670
But nicotine in my driver's side is,
um,

2218
01:38:11,730 --> 01:38:14,220
another precursor that you can take in 
supplemental form.

2219
01:38:14,580 --> 01:38:19,260
And there's been studies over the past 
few years looking at how in animals it's

2220
01:38:19,261 --> 01:38:21,180
been able to eat,
increase nad levels.

2221
01:38:21,510 --> 01:38:24,540
It's able to like basically improve 
physical performance,

2222
01:38:24,541 --> 01:38:29,541
cognitive performance.
It's able to make your tissues age 

2223
01:38:29,541 --> 01:38:29,541
better,
your organs,

2224
01:38:29,541 --> 01:38:30,540
age better and in,
in animals.

2225
01:38:31,050 --> 01:38:34,290
So I'm now,
there's like ben preclinical trials that

2226
01:38:34,291 --> 01:38:34,880
are,
sorry,

2227
01:38:34,950 --> 01:38:39,950
clinical trials that have been under 
undergoing one showing that you actually

2228
01:38:40,411 --> 01:38:45,411
can take the supplemental form of nad 
nicotinamide riboside and you can 

2229
01:38:45,411 --> 01:38:48,471
increase your nad levels it just 
dependent manner so as to say that just 

2230
01:38:48,471 --> 01:38:51,980
came out recently and there's now um,
um,

2231
01:38:52,110 --> 01:38:57,110
there's now like 10 clinical trials that
have been under that are undergoing 

2232
01:38:57,110 --> 01:38:58,590
right now looking at the role of 
supplemental nicotine,

2233
01:38:58,920 --> 01:39:02,670
nicotine in my right beside,
in a dementia in obesity,

2234
01:39:03,020 --> 01:39:08,020
um,
traumatic brain injuries and other one 

2235
01:39:08,020 --> 01:39:09,240
and then some other type of metabolic 
dysfunction so that the,

2236
01:39:09,270 --> 01:39:12,090
these are currently being investigated 
in humans.

2237
01:39:12,360 --> 01:39:14,970
So the sad thing is another real big 
interest of mine.

2238
01:39:15,960 --> 01:39:20,960
I did buy the supplement,
but I'm not taking it right now because 

2239
01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:20,960
I'm breastfeeding and I'm just not sure 
how that,

2240
01:39:21,280 --> 01:39:25,800
you know how that goes.
But you're asking me about the ib stuff.

2241
01:39:25,801 --> 01:39:29,820
I think that's something that is now 
popular everywhere I've looked at,

2242
01:39:29,821 --> 01:39:31,980
I've looked it up.
It's like it's becoming really popular.

2243
01:39:31,981 --> 01:39:36,981
But the thing is,
is that there's really no clinical 

2244
01:39:36,981 --> 01:39:36,981
evidence of it,
you know,

2245
01:39:36,981 --> 01:39:39,480
of like if you,
if you intravenously take ned,

2246
01:39:39,840 --> 01:39:42,420
is that gonna have the same effect that,
you know,

2247
01:39:42,450 --> 01:39:44,880
taking nicotinamide riboside does,
does it get into your cells?

2248
01:39:45,210 --> 01:39:47,640
So it's an open question,
but it seems,

2249
01:39:47,700 --> 01:39:52,700
it seems like people are.
I'm getting results and obviously it's 

2250
01:39:52,700 --> 01:39:54,560
all anecdotal.
I don't have anything ivy.

2251
01:39:54,570 --> 01:39:56,710
Have you ever done like ivy vitamin 
infusions?

2252
01:39:57,420 --> 01:39:58,740
No.
No,

2253
01:39:58,820 --> 01:39:59,540
I haven't either.

2254
01:39:59,790 --> 01:40:01,820
I haven't done anything.
Always look at it.

2255
01:40:01,821 --> 01:40:02,270
I go,
oh,

2256
01:40:02,560 --> 01:40:03,470
that's good.
What?

2257
01:40:03,970 --> 01:40:08,970
Right.
I mean I don't want to sit there and 

2258
01:40:08,970 --> 01:40:08,970
have vitamins pumped into my veins for 
nothing.

2259
01:40:08,970 --> 01:40:13,940
I've had people,
I've had people tell me that like great 

2260
01:40:13,940 --> 01:40:15,150
things about doing the nad nad plus is 
what it's actually called.

2261
01:40:15,540 --> 01:40:18,540
But I've never actually,
I've never tried that.

2262
01:40:18,541 --> 01:40:21,660
And I think before I would do something 
like that,

2263
01:40:21,661 --> 01:40:23,450
I would probably try the nicotine in my 
beside,

2264
01:40:23,490 --> 01:40:26,460
which we know for a fact does increase,
you know,

2265
01:40:26,610 --> 01:40:31,610
nad levels and multiple tissues.
And it would be nice to have some of 

2266
01:40:31,610 --> 01:40:33,270
these clinics that are doing it,
like aggregate the data.

2267
01:40:33,271 --> 01:40:38,271
And publish it because no one's going to
fund this study like people aren't 

2268
01:40:38,271 --> 01:40:38,271
studying that,
you know,

2269
01:40:38,271 --> 01:40:42,900
so there's no way to really know if it's
placebo or really,

2270
01:40:42,901 --> 01:40:45,060
you know,
because there's no data.

2271
01:40:45,600 --> 01:40:50,600
So it'd be,
it'd be kinda nice to like people would 

2272
01:40:50,600 --> 01:40:53,680
start to aggregate data on that.
But well it's really interesting when it

2273
01:40:53,681 --> 01:40:54,430
comes to data

2274
01:40:54,490 --> 01:40:59,490
when it comes to diet,
because you know the whole throw the 

2275
01:40:59,490 --> 01:41:03,931
baby out with the bathwater thing.
One of the studies that I've read pretty

2276
01:41:03,971 --> 01:41:08,971
recently was about the amount of people 
that suffered ill health consequences 

2277
01:41:09,161 --> 01:41:13,510
that ate red meat five days per week 
versus people who didn't.

2278
01:41:13,870 --> 01:41:18,870
But what they didn't take into account 
was what the people ate with the red 

2279
01:41:18,870 --> 01:41:20,380
meat when they drank soda with it.
How did you get your form of red meat?

2280
01:41:20,410 --> 01:41:24,370
Was it grass fed beef?
Was it bison or wild game?

2281
01:41:24,550 --> 01:41:29,550
Or was it a burger from wendy's with 
fries and the sugar bond and all the 

2282
01:41:29,770 --> 01:41:32,680
bullshit that people eat along with the 
food and that you,

2283
01:41:32,740 --> 01:41:37,740
you literally.
And people would cite these things as 

2284
01:41:37,740 --> 01:41:38,410
being evidence that something is 
negative for you,

2285
01:41:38,620 --> 01:41:42,220
that red meat is negative for you,
but you're not taking into consideration

2286
01:41:42,221 --> 01:41:44,230
all of the things that we're eating with
that red meat.

2287
01:41:44,230 --> 01:41:47,430
So these studies that come out like that
are so they're.

2288
01:41:47,440 --> 01:41:50,530
They're really annoying because it's 
like you have to,

2289
01:41:50,531 --> 01:41:53,410
you usually talk to people about it.
You have to like sit down with them.

2290
01:41:53,411 --> 01:41:54,100
Okay,
sit down.

2291
01:41:55,230 --> 01:42:00,230
Okay,
this is a long process to try to try to 

2292
01:42:01,450 --> 01:42:06,450
figure out what is the cause of these 
issues when you're talking about a 

2293
01:42:06,450 --> 01:42:10,141
lifetime of abuse,
you're talking about like all sorts of 

2294
01:42:10,141 --> 01:42:13,591
different health consequences of a 
variety of different foods and you're 

2295
01:42:13,591 --> 01:42:16,381
attributing it all to one part of your 
diet and that's very difficult to do 

2296
01:42:16,381 --> 01:42:17,710
unless you,
you've isolated everything else and done

2297
01:42:17,711 --> 01:42:22,711
a bunch of different studies where okay,
I ate nothing but fruits and vegetables 

2298
01:42:22,711 --> 01:42:26,701
and I really healthy and I read meet 
five days a week or I nothing but shit 

2299
01:42:27,760 --> 01:42:32,760
and fries and bonds and pasta and I 
didn't eat red meat at all.

2300
01:42:33,490 --> 01:42:34,630
And now here's the result.

2301
01:42:34,910 --> 01:42:36,960
Right?
If you're making a really good point and

2302
01:42:36,961 --> 01:42:41,961
that is the combination of how these 
different foods are interacting in our 

2303
01:42:42,301 --> 01:42:44,820
bodies,
extremely important.

2304
01:42:44,821 --> 01:42:47,190
Like we talked about the refined sugar 
and saturated fat combo.

2305
01:42:47,550 --> 01:42:48,210
Well,
you know,

2306
01:42:48,440 --> 01:42:49,250
the,
the,

2307
01:42:49,270 --> 01:42:53,130
the red meat and even just protein like 
itself,

2308
01:42:53,131 --> 01:42:53,650
like,
you know,

2309
01:42:53,860 --> 01:42:58,860
essential amino acids that are coming 
from animal protein itself and how that 

2310
01:42:58,860 --> 01:42:58,860
is interacting with,
you know,

2311
01:42:58,890 --> 01:43:03,890
eating,
eating a terrible diet like refined 

2312
01:43:03,890 --> 01:43:03,890
sugar which is causing damage to 
ourselves.

2313
01:43:03,890 --> 01:43:08,390
You know,
also exercise and this is something 

2314
01:43:08,390 --> 01:43:08,390
really,
um,

2315
01:43:08,390 --> 01:43:08,460
the,
the,

2316
01:43:08,470 --> 01:43:11,430
the protein,
a exercise thing seems to be really key.

2317
01:43:11,431 --> 01:43:16,431
But there was a recent study that was 
published that was the largest study 

2318
01:43:16,431 --> 01:43:21,170
observational study done so far,
looking at protein intake and all cause 

2319
01:43:21,170 --> 01:43:23,870
mortality and cancer mortality.
And it found a,

2320
01:43:24,180 --> 01:43:27,300
like a lot of other studies that higher 
protein consumption,

2321
01:43:27,720 --> 01:43:32,720
higher meat,
protein consumption from meat was 

2322
01:43:32,720 --> 01:43:34,050
associated with a higher all cause 
mortality in a higher cancer mortality.

2323
01:43:34,320 --> 01:43:36,930
But then when the data was analyzed and,
and,

2324
01:43:36,970 --> 01:43:39,450
and other unhealthy lifestyle factors 
will look at.

2325
01:43:39,451 --> 01:43:41,100
So.
So if,

2326
01:43:41,160 --> 01:43:46,160
if someone had one other unhealthy 
lifestyle factor being either obesity,

2327
01:43:46,261 --> 01:43:51,261
smoking,
excessive alcohol consumption or being 

2328
01:43:51,261 --> 01:43:51,290
sedentary than they had a higher,
they were,

2329
01:43:51,291 --> 01:43:54,110
had a higher all cause mortality in a 
higher cancer mortality if they meat.

2330
01:43:54,470 --> 01:43:56,180
But guess what,
if they had zero,

2331
01:43:56,480 --> 01:44:00,230
none of those other unhealthy lifestyle 
factors they didn't have.

2332
01:44:00,231 --> 01:44:05,231
They had the same aisle all cause 
mortality and cancer related mortality 

2333
01:44:05,231 --> 01:44:08,951
that the non meat eater tat.
So I think that really highlights the 

2334
01:44:08,951 --> 01:44:11,990
importance of other lifestyle factors.
Other foods,

2335
01:44:12,320 --> 01:44:14,170
you know,
that's really important when we're at,

2336
01:44:14,171 --> 01:44:15,950
when we're looking at these 
observational studies,

2337
01:44:15,990 --> 01:44:20,990
when you were talking about saturated 
fat and the negative consequences of 

2338
01:44:20,990 --> 01:44:23,160
eating refined sugar with saturated fat,
is there a negative,

2339
01:44:23,240 --> 01:44:25,980
I'm a corresponding negative 
consequence.

2340
01:44:26,280 --> 01:44:31,280
Like if you had a negative or if you had
um,

2341
01:44:31,940 --> 01:44:36,940
a,
a diet that didn't have any saturated 

2342
01:44:36,940 --> 01:44:36,940
fat in it,
but you ate refined sugar,

2343
01:44:36,940 --> 01:44:41,600
like say if you eat a vegan diet,
does saturated or does refined sugar 

2344
01:44:41,761 --> 01:44:42,990
have less of an impact

2345
01:44:43,810 --> 01:44:46,910
of eating refined sugars?
The ldl,

2346
01:44:47,080 --> 01:44:50,000
it's an issue with fat it,
I think.

2347
01:44:50,240 --> 01:44:54,170
Yes.
So the ldl will go down if you're eating

2348
01:44:54,171 --> 01:44:59,171
a vegan diet and even though you're 
still eating cookies or some whatever 

2349
01:44:59,171 --> 01:44:59,650
vegan stuff,
you know,

2350
01:44:59,830 --> 01:45:04,830
fine.
Sugar's probably like less dangerous to 

2351
01:45:04,830 --> 01:45:04,830
someone on a vegan diet.
Is that?

2352
01:45:04,830 --> 01:45:04,830
Yes,
I think so.

2353
01:45:04,830 --> 01:45:05,610
And,
and the thing,

2354
01:45:05,640 --> 01:45:07,730
the thing with that is,
is that if you look at,

2355
01:45:07,750 --> 01:45:12,750
but if you look at refined sugar,
also refined sugar is associated with 

2356
01:45:12,750 --> 01:45:13,740
heart disease risk.
In fact it's like one of the,

2357
01:45:13,741 --> 01:45:14,490
you know,
there was a big,

2358
01:45:14,491 --> 01:45:19,491
big study like 400,000
different individuals looked at refined 

2359
01:45:19,491 --> 01:45:23,031
shirt,
people that had the highest refined 

2360
01:45:23,031 --> 01:45:23,031
sugar intake,
but again,

2361
01:45:23,031 --> 01:45:25,461
saturated fats,
a confounding factor there had like a 

2362
01:45:25,461 --> 01:45:26,220
four times higher risk of getting heart,
having a heart attack.

2363
01:45:26,580 --> 01:45:29,250
But it's perfect.
You illustrated it perfectly.

2364
01:45:29,251 --> 01:45:34,251
And that is,
and that's where I think a lot of these 

2365
01:45:34,251 --> 01:45:34,251
guidelines,
like the american heart association come

2366
01:45:34,251 --> 01:45:36,000
from.
If you on a population level,

2367
01:45:36,210 --> 01:45:39,420
if you say to someone reduce your 
saturated fat intake,

2368
01:45:40,080 --> 01:45:45,080
you're going to lower the ldl risk and 
regardless of all the other stuff 

2369
01:45:45,080 --> 01:45:45,080
they're doing,
you know,

2370
01:45:45,080 --> 01:45:48,150
it probably will on a population level,
lower their heart disease risk,

2371
01:45:48,360 --> 01:45:51,150
but on an individual level like someone 
like you and I,

2372
01:45:51,600 --> 01:45:53,340
we don't eat all that other stuff,
you know,

2373
01:45:53,341 --> 01:45:56,250
we were very health conscious and do all
these things.

2374
01:45:56,520 --> 01:45:59,280
You and I,
if we stopped our saturated fat intake,

2375
01:45:59,790 --> 01:46:01,120
likely,
you know,

2376
01:46:01,230 --> 01:46:06,230
for me,
I guess my jeans are a little different 

2377
01:46:06,230 --> 01:46:06,230
but likely wouldn't have the same 
effect.

2378
01:46:06,230 --> 01:46:08,580
So if you were to take that same 
population of people and say,

2379
01:46:09,180 --> 01:46:10,590
okay,
eat your saturated fat,

2380
01:46:10,620 --> 01:46:15,090
but take out the refined sugar,
we may see the same thing where the,

2381
01:46:15,330 --> 01:46:19,140
where the heart disease risk goes down 
just like it does with saturated fat.

2382
01:46:19,230 --> 01:46:24,230
In fact,
there had been studies where a 

2383
01:46:24,230 --> 01:46:24,230
replacement foods have done,
have looked at,

2384
01:46:24,230 --> 01:46:25,380
um,
replacement fruits for saturated fat.

2385
01:46:25,381 --> 01:46:27,160
And if you replace saturated fat with 
refined sugar,

2386
01:46:27,161 --> 01:46:28,450
it does not,
um,

2387
01:46:28,830 --> 01:46:33,830
lower the risk of heart disease.
So basically that's kind of a proof of 

2388
01:46:35,131 --> 01:46:37,360
principle there,
but I do think that it's,

2389
01:46:37,420 --> 01:46:42,420
it's an,
it's an important point and it's 

2390
01:46:42,420 --> 01:46:42,420
something that the american heart 
association there,

2391
01:46:42,420 --> 01:46:46,020
they're now starting to at least 
mentioned the small dense ldl particles.

2392
01:46:46,350 --> 01:46:50,040
So I think that moving in that direction
is because it means

2393
01:46:50,040 --> 01:46:51,750
that possibly then,
you know,

2394
01:46:51,751 --> 01:46:53,460
over the next decade we're going to 
start to see,

2395
01:46:53,790 --> 01:46:55,320
okay,
now we got to start.

2396
01:46:55,321 --> 01:47:00,321
It's not just the ldl,
I'm confused about something you just 

2397
01:47:00,321 --> 01:47:02,841
said.
You said if you replace saturated fat 

2398
01:47:02,841 --> 01:47:05,180
with refined sugar,
if you replace the saturated fat with 

2399
01:47:05,180 --> 01:47:07,800
refined sugar,
refined carbohydrates,

2400
01:47:07,801 --> 01:47:09,840
which I usually think of as refined 
sugar,

2401
01:47:09,940 --> 01:47:12,510
refined carbohydrates,
it does not.

2402
01:47:12,990 --> 01:47:15,570
So the idea is of saturated fat was so 
bad.

2403
01:47:15,900 --> 01:47:20,900
If you replaced,
if you took the saturated fat and 

2404
01:47:20,900 --> 01:47:22,701
replaced it with refined carbohydrate,
it would lower the risk of heart 

2405
01:47:22,701 --> 01:47:22,701
disease.
And it does,

2406
01:47:22,701 --> 01:47:23,910
it doesn't.
It doesn't lower the risk.

2407
01:47:24,170 --> 01:47:24,930
Right?
So,

2408
01:47:24,960 --> 01:47:29,960
so basically other saturated fats,
the saturated fat along with refined 

2409
01:47:30,061 --> 01:47:33,000
sugar that has some sort of a negative 
synergistic effect.

2410
01:47:33,030 --> 01:47:35,340
That's what,
that's what the data and aggregation,

2411
01:47:35,341 --> 01:47:37,680
looking at the clinical trials,
looking at the mechanism,

2412
01:47:37,950 --> 01:47:41,340
looking at the observational studies and
and understanding the interaction of all

2413
01:47:41,341 --> 01:47:45,030
these foods together and the wideness 
when the american heart association puts

2414
01:47:45,031 --> 01:47:46,830
out sort of a blanket statement like 
that.

2415
01:47:47,220 --> 01:47:52,220
A lot of people take it as fact and then
what my research has shown my reading 

2416
01:47:53,731 --> 01:47:55,170
rather shouldn't say research.
I'm a dummy,

2417
01:47:55,440 --> 01:48:00,440
but the people that I've read who have 
criticized this are actually scientists 

2418
01:48:00,440 --> 01:48:04,731
and researchers.
They have a huge issue with that 

2419
01:48:04,731 --> 01:48:04,731
statement.
They think that this is just,

2420
01:48:04,731 --> 01:48:09,081
it's too simplistic.
It's not taking into account all the 

2421
01:48:09,081 --> 01:48:09,240
various nuances in genetics,
diet,

2422
01:48:09,241 --> 01:48:11,280
ancestry,
all the different factors,

2423
01:48:11,520 --> 01:48:16,520
but people read that and it sort of like
this cookie cutter approach and then 

2424
01:48:16,520 --> 01:48:17,700
they paired it out to everybody else.
Yeah,

2425
01:48:17,790 --> 01:48:19,300
it's true.
I mean that's.

2426
01:48:19,340 --> 01:48:24,340
That's exactly what happens and that 
same thing goes with the protein in it 

2427
01:48:24,340 --> 01:48:28,911
being bad as well and there's all sorts 
of nuances and the combination of the 

2428
01:48:28,911 --> 01:48:30,630
protein with the,
with the bad diet and also the exercise,

2429
01:48:30,660 --> 01:48:32,930
which is one of the.
One of the things with the,

2430
01:48:32,960 --> 01:48:37,440
with the protein is that it increases 
igf one and igf one growth factor and it

2431
01:48:37,441 --> 01:48:40,830
can allow b cells that are damaged,
that would otherwise die,

2432
01:48:40,831 --> 01:48:45,831
not die,
and so it can allow precancerous cells 

2433
01:48:45,831 --> 01:48:45,831
to form a tumor and that's.

2434
01:48:45,831 --> 01:48:48,310
We know that from mechanistic studies 
and you know that's.

2435
01:48:48,340 --> 01:48:53,340
That's kind of a big part of the the 
eating protein essential amino acids 

2436
01:48:53,340 --> 01:48:58,011
specifically or what does it do do this 
and they're found in animal protein and 

2437
01:48:58,011 --> 01:48:58,011
that.
Sort of the big argument there,

2438
01:48:58,380 --> 01:49:03,380
but there's also this whole argument 
where if you are one exercising the igf 

2439
01:49:03,781 --> 01:49:08,781
one goes into your brain.
It's been trying to cross the blood 

2440
01:49:08,781 --> 01:49:08,781
brain barrier.
It goes into your brain and also in your

2441
01:49:08,781 --> 01:49:11,690
muscle where it grows new neurons in the
brain and actually repairs damaged,

2442
01:49:11,910 --> 01:49:14,580
damaged muscle tissue and helps grow 
muscle tissue.

2443
01:49:14,581 --> 01:49:17,460
Which is also an a predictor of of all 
caused mortality.

2444
01:49:17,730 --> 01:49:19,680
So you know the,
again,

2445
01:49:19,681 --> 01:49:24,681
the exercise comes in there and then 
also the fact that if you're eating a 

2446
01:49:24,681 --> 01:49:28,491
good diet and you're not,
you're not causing as much damage to 

2447
01:49:28,491 --> 01:49:31,311
happen in the first place,
then those growth factors being there 

2448
01:49:31,311 --> 01:49:34,071
aren't as big of a deal because you 
don't have all these damaged cells from 

2449
01:49:34,071 --> 01:49:37,701
all this refined sugar you're eating 
that can basically become cancerous 

2450
01:49:37,701 --> 01:49:37,701
cells.
So that's kind of,

2451
01:49:38,340 --> 01:49:39,360
you know,
with that study,

2452
01:49:39,361 --> 01:49:42,060
the observational study that looked at 
people that were eating me,

2453
01:49:42,061 --> 01:49:44,250
if they didn't have any of those 
unhealthy lifestyle factors,

2454
01:49:44,251 --> 01:49:49,251
guess what?
They're all cause mortality and cancer 

2455
01:49:49,251 --> 01:49:49,251
mortality was the same as the 
vegetarians.

2456
01:49:49,251 --> 01:49:50,810
And I think that's kind of highlighting 
that,

2457
01:49:50,850 --> 01:49:51,880
that,
that issue,

2458
01:49:51,970 --> 01:49:52,390
you know,

2459
01:49:52,510 --> 01:49:57,510
well I have a friend who's a scientist 
who's talking to me about me and he 

2460
01:49:57,510 --> 01:49:57,510
goes,
ms dot essentially amino acids,

2461
01:49:57,510 --> 01:49:58,760
protein and water.
He's like,

2462
01:49:58,761 --> 01:50:03,761
it's not going to cause you cancer.
It's like this is not what the problem 

2463
01:50:03,761 --> 01:50:03,761
is.
He goes,

2464
01:50:03,761 --> 01:50:07,031
you,
you have some issues with the way it's 

2465
01:50:07,031 --> 01:50:07,031
cooked.
So for sure like things that are charred

2466
01:50:07,031 --> 01:50:08,930
or not good for you,
there's carcinogens right?

2467
01:50:08,931 --> 01:50:10,580
And in the black and charred.

2468
01:50:10,680 --> 01:50:15,680
Yeah,
I mean there's heterocyclic aiming 

2469
01:50:15,680 --> 01:50:17,530
second forum when you cook meat at a 
really high temperature and those are 

2470
01:50:17,530 --> 01:50:18,720
carcinogens and.
But our body,

2471
01:50:18,780 --> 01:50:23,010
our bodies have genes that are able to 
inactivate those somebodies,

2472
01:50:23,011 --> 01:50:26,220
but some not people can do it to,
to various levels.

2473
01:50:26,221 --> 01:50:29,340
There's certain polymorphisms in genes 
that I'm basically,

2474
01:50:29,341 --> 01:50:32,280
some people can detoxify it really well 
and they're,

2475
01:50:32,320 --> 01:50:37,320
they're called detoxification enzymes 
and some people don't do it quite as 

2476
01:50:37,320 --> 01:50:37,320
well.
And the people that don't do it quite as

2477
01:50:37,320 --> 01:50:39,690
well probably shouldn't charge their 
meat as much.

2478
01:50:39,691 --> 01:50:41,600
Like you shouldn't eat it like everyday,
like charred,

2479
01:50:41,840 --> 01:50:43,260
but,
but that's not.

2480
01:50:43,261 --> 01:50:47,850
The big issue isn't so much that as the,
the igf one,

2481
01:50:47,851 --> 01:50:50,610
which doesn't cause cancer,
but it allows cancer cells to grow.

2482
01:50:50,970 --> 01:50:52,740
So the difference,
it's like one is like,

2483
01:50:52,770 --> 01:50:54,210
oh you eat meat,
it causes cancer.

2484
01:50:54,211 --> 01:50:55,950
Well no,
that's not necessarily true.

2485
01:50:56,220 --> 01:51:01,220
You eat a lot of meat and you don't 
exercise and you keep having igf one 

2486
01:51:01,220 --> 01:51:04,161
around and you have all these other 
damaged cells because you're eating all 

2487
01:51:04,161 --> 01:51:06,640
this other crap which is causing damage.
Then you're allowing the igf one no,

2488
01:51:06,790 --> 01:51:11,790
to allow those damaged cells to grow.
So one is like a promoting where it's 

2489
01:51:11,790 --> 01:51:15,201
promoting the growth of cancer and the 
other one's saying it causes so it 

2490
01:51:15,201 --> 01:51:16,930
doesn't cause in that sense.
Now in the carcinogen,

2491
01:51:17,380 --> 01:51:22,380
if you're getting a ton of carcinogens 
and plus there's studies showing that 

2492
01:51:23,220 --> 01:51:27,510
eating cruciferous vegetables,
the isothiocyanates and people that have

2493
01:51:27,511 --> 01:51:32,511
that gene polymorphism that don't 
detoxify the heterocyclic amiens as 

2494
01:51:32,511 --> 01:51:34,290
well.
If they eat a diet high in,

2495
01:51:34,291 --> 01:51:37,360
in cruciferous vegetables and they have 
isothiocyanates it,

2496
01:51:37,560 --> 01:51:42,560
they also inactivate those,
those web pro carcinogens and so a 

2497
01:51:43,020 --> 01:51:46,290
broccoli sprouts,
broccoli,

2498
01:51:46,350 --> 01:51:47,550
cauliflower,
cabbage,

2499
01:51:47,551 --> 01:51:50,520
brussels sprouts,
broccoli sprouts industry.

2500
01:51:50,521 --> 01:51:52,590
The last time you were on it,
it's amazing.

2501
01:51:52,591 --> 01:51:57,591
I've had people emailing me that like 
they're either them themselves or their 

2502
01:51:57,591 --> 01:52:01,320
father or someone there taking care of 
their prostate cancer biomarker.

2503
01:52:01,350 --> 01:52:06,350
The prostate stimulating angela antigen 
has like gone down like two fold after 

2504
01:52:06,350 --> 01:52:08,730
doing the broccoli sprouts every day for
x amount of time,

2505
01:52:09,060 --> 01:52:11,670
which is something we talked about 
because it's clinical.

2506
01:52:11,700 --> 01:52:14,340
Clinical trials have shown that it's,
it's very powerful.

2507
01:52:14,580 --> 01:52:15,590
Now when you,
um,

2508
01:52:15,630 --> 01:52:16,550
when you look at animals,
animal

2509
01:52:16,550 --> 01:52:19,430
protein,
and I'm including fish in this for this,

2510
01:52:19,431 --> 01:52:23,000
um,
is there any benefit to a specific type?

2511
01:52:23,280 --> 01:52:28,280
Like someone was telling me that red 
meat is better for you than chicken and 

2512
01:52:28,280 --> 01:52:28,280
I was like,
well,

2513
01:52:28,280 --> 01:52:29,600
how do you know?
And they're like,

2514
01:52:29,601 --> 01:52:31,820
well,
how it makes me feel kind said,

2515
01:52:31,821 --> 01:52:36,821
okay,
well that doesn't seem to make much 

2516
01:52:36,821 --> 01:52:36,821
sense.
Like what is.

2517
01:52:36,821 --> 01:52:37,430
But is there a difference?
I mean obviously there's a difference in

2518
01:52:37,431 --> 01:52:42,431
the protein content,
like have some meats or wild game has 

2519
01:52:42,431 --> 01:52:44,540
much higher protein content than say 
domestic beef.

2520
01:52:45,020 --> 01:52:45,770
But when you

2521
01:52:46,010 --> 01:52:47,690
think like fish,
like is there,

2522
01:52:47,700 --> 01:52:51,560
is our living animals all created equal?
That's the question.

2523
01:52:51,800 --> 01:52:53,360
Well of course there's lots of 
differences.

2524
01:52:53,361 --> 01:52:58,361
I mean if the protein,
the amino acid makeup are different and 

2525
01:52:58,361 --> 01:52:59,540
I'm not an expert on that so I can't 
tell you all the differences there.

2526
01:52:59,990 --> 01:53:03,050
But there's differences in,
in the micronutrient concentrations.

2527
01:53:03,051 --> 01:53:05,000
I mean omega three fatty acids are in 
fish,

2528
01:53:05,060 --> 01:53:08,250
are a lot of irons and in red meat.
So there's difference,

2529
01:53:08,450 --> 01:53:09,620
different zinc,
you know,

2530
01:53:09,800 --> 01:53:11,270
iron,
selenium,

2531
01:53:11,330 --> 01:53:16,330
omega three fatty acids,
all these different things are found in 

2532
01:53:16,330 --> 01:53:17,150
different concentrations,
in different types of meat and you know,

2533
01:53:17,151 --> 01:53:22,151
so for that reason it's kind of good to 
eat a diverse array of different types 

2534
01:53:22,151 --> 01:53:22,810
because you're getting,
you know,

2535
01:53:22,820 --> 01:53:27,820
22 percent of all your enzymes in your 
body require micronutrients as a 

2536
01:53:27,820 --> 01:53:27,820
cofactor to work,
you know,

2537
01:53:27,820 --> 01:53:29,750
and the omega three fatty acids are 
important,

2538
01:53:29,751 --> 01:53:31,580
you know,
really important for the brain,

2539
01:53:31,670 --> 01:53:33,590
hugely important for the brain.

2540
01:53:33,590 --> 01:53:36,890
So I think that in that respect,
you know,

2541
01:53:37,090 --> 01:53:42,090
there are obviously differences in terms
of the different types of meat that 

2542
01:53:42,090 --> 01:53:43,040
you're eating,
right?

2543
01:53:43,041 --> 01:53:44,540
I mean,
so,

2544
01:53:44,600 --> 01:53:46,280
so yeah.
But um,

2545
01:53:47,060 --> 01:53:48,960
and then the ratio of the proteins are 
different.

2546
01:53:48,990 --> 01:53:51,380
I don't know exactly how,
what,

2547
01:53:51,410 --> 01:53:53,090
what those differences are,
but you know,

2548
01:53:53,091 --> 01:53:55,070
there's,
that affects things as well.

2549
01:53:55,270 --> 01:54:00,270
So do you think what a good healthy 
approach if someone does eat meat is to 

2550
01:54:00,270 --> 01:54:00,740
d a little bit of everything,
like a little bit of salmon,

2551
01:54:01,130 --> 01:54:03,230
maybe a little bit of red meat,
a little bit of bias and a little bit of

2552
01:54:03,231 --> 01:54:08,231
chicken.
I think that's the approach I like to 

2553
01:54:08,231 --> 01:54:10,991
take because I like to,
I like to look at things in terms of 

2554
01:54:10,991 --> 01:54:13,880
nutrient quality and why am I,
why am I eating this food?

2555
01:54:13,910 --> 01:54:16,160
Oh,
I'm eating this food because I want this

2556
01:54:16,161 --> 01:54:17,420
type of amino acid profile.

2557
01:54:17,420 --> 01:54:19,640
I want these micronutrients,
you know,

2558
01:54:19,641 --> 01:54:22,700
I,
I want 'em either this type of prebiotic

2559
01:54:22,701 --> 01:54:27,701
fiber or not and you know,
so I kind of look at it as these 

2560
01:54:27,701 --> 01:54:28,460
nutrient delivery vesicles that I'm like
taking in.

2561
01:54:28,690 --> 01:54:31,640
And that's,
that's the approach I like.

2562
01:54:31,641 --> 01:54:32,130
I,
you know,

2563
01:54:32,310 --> 01:54:37,310
it's,
I'm a little biased because I've been 

2564
01:54:37,310 --> 01:54:37,400
doing a lot of research on 
micronutrients and so I,

2565
01:54:37,600 --> 01:54:40,840
you know,
I know how important they are and I've,

2566
01:54:40,870 --> 01:54:45,870
and I've,
I've studied even in people things like 

2567
01:54:45,870 --> 01:54:48,580
biomarkers of aging,
like dna damage and seeing how they 

2568
01:54:48,580 --> 01:54:51,161
change with different micro nutrient 
intakes or different types of fiber 

2569
01:54:51,161 --> 01:54:51,410
intakes or you know,
things like that.

2570
01:54:51,411 --> 01:54:52,210
So,
so,

2571
01:54:52,370 --> 01:54:53,180
you know,
for me,

2572
01:54:53,181 --> 01:54:56,420
I kind of am a little biased in that 
sense,

2573
01:54:56,421 --> 01:54:57,350
but um,
you know,

2574
01:54:57,560 --> 01:54:59,540
it's,
it's the approach that I like to take,

2575
01:54:59,840 --> 01:55:00,830
you know,
for example,

2576
01:55:00,950 --> 01:55:02,390
this is a really good story.

2577
01:55:02,390 --> 01:55:04,430
And my,
my mentor Bruce Bruce ames,

2578
01:55:04,431 --> 01:55:07,460
who I talk about a lot,
he was the inventor of the ames test,

2579
01:55:07,461 --> 01:55:12,461
which is a test that really cheap test 
that you can do to determine whether or 

2580
01:55:12,461 --> 01:55:12,470
not something is a carcinogen.
In fact,

2581
01:55:12,560 --> 01:55:15,860
I'm sure the heterocyclic amines were 
determined from his test because you can

2582
01:55:15,861 --> 01:55:20,861
dump something on and he can base it,
basically can tell you like in a matter 

2583
01:55:20,861 --> 01:55:20,861
of minutes.
Right?

2584
01:55:20,861 --> 01:55:21,410
So he's,
that was his,

2585
01:55:21,411 --> 01:55:23,050
like he,
he was,

2586
01:55:23,060 --> 01:55:28,060
um,
pioneered that back in like the late 

2587
01:55:28,060 --> 01:55:28,060
seventies,
early eighties,

2588
01:55:28,060 --> 01:55:28,990
and he was responsible for getting 
carcinogens out of hair dye,

2589
01:55:29,040 --> 01:55:31,640
women's hair dyes out of children's 
pajamas.

2590
01:55:32,030 --> 01:55:37,030
Lots of,
lots of really big health impacts that 

2591
01:55:37,030 --> 01:55:37,030
he was in pajamas.
Um,

2592
01:55:37,030 --> 01:55:39,710
there was some kind of polyurethane ish 
thing.

2593
01:55:39,711 --> 01:55:41,630
I don't remember exactly.
It's not there anymore,

2594
01:55:41,870 --> 01:55:42,960
but it was,
it was,

2595
01:55:42,990 --> 01:55:44,880
it was to prevent them from,
it was a flame retardant.

2596
01:55:45,050 --> 01:55:46,920
Oh,
it was a flame retardant and it was,

2597
01:55:46,950 --> 01:55:51,950
it was completely a carcinogen and it 
was ending up in children's urine and 

2598
01:55:51,950 --> 01:55:51,950
stuff.
They were measuring it.

2599
01:55:51,950 --> 01:55:52,650
Yeah.
So anyways,

2600
01:55:52,940 --> 01:55:57,940
my point is is that he used to be in 
this whole like cancer or chemical 

2601
01:55:58,051 --> 01:56:01,590
carcinogen field and then one day like,
you know,

2602
01:56:01,591 --> 01:56:02,730
someone in his loud did,
blab,

2603
01:56:02,731 --> 01:56:07,731
did an experiment where they like left 
full laid out of the sample and there 

2604
01:56:07,731 --> 01:56:09,270
was massive amounts of dna damage 
happening.

2605
01:56:09,540 --> 01:56:10,980
He was like,
what's going on here?

2606
01:56:11,250 --> 01:56:16,250
And they started to do this in mice and 
found that like a low folate dial diet 

2607
01:56:16,381 --> 01:56:20,520
caused damage to dna,
the same as being irradiated by an x ray

2608
01:56:20,521 --> 01:56:21,810
machine.
The exact same.

2609
01:56:22,380 --> 01:56:27,380
And then he went into people and found 
there was a really small pilot 

2610
01:56:27,380 --> 01:56:31,761
experiment but similar the cause dna 
damage on people that had a low full a 

2611
01:56:31,761 --> 01:56:31,761
diet.

2612
01:56:31,761 --> 01:56:36,230
And he said that one experiment right 
there changed the whole course of his 

2613
01:56:36,230 --> 01:56:39,741
field of study where he all of a sudden 
went into nutrition and micronutrients 

2614
01:56:39,741 --> 01:56:43,551
and that became his thing from the 
eighties on and kind of from an 

2615
01:56:43,551 --> 01:56:43,551
accident.
Yeah,

2616
01:56:43,551 --> 01:56:44,620
from an accident,
doesn't that happen all the time in lab?

2617
01:56:44,740 --> 01:56:46,440
All the time.
It's with the best stuff.

2618
01:56:46,830 --> 01:56:49,200
It was funny because the guy in his lab 
was like calling.

2619
01:56:49,201 --> 01:56:52,130
He was trying to figure out what is 
going on here and then he.

2620
01:56:52,200 --> 01:56:57,200
He looked at his assistant had ordered 
this media that you put on cells and he 

2621
01:56:57,200 --> 01:57:01,341
looked at the media,
try to figure out what was in it and 

2622
01:57:01,341 --> 01:57:03,441
they saw it was a specific type of media
that the assistant had ordered 

2623
01:57:03,441 --> 01:57:07,340
incorrectly that lacked full late and so
this whole thing was all started from 

2624
01:57:07,351 --> 01:57:09,310
that and so credible.
Yeah.

2625
01:57:09,360 --> 01:57:14,360
So he published that seminal paperwork.
Literally he compared my being 

2626
01:57:14,360 --> 01:57:18,260
irradiated under an x ray machine to low
folate and it was identical.

2627
01:57:18,690 --> 01:57:19,590
Now,
would that be

2628
01:57:19,600 --> 01:57:24,600
be something that people should take 
into their diet of say if they are 

2629
01:57:24,600 --> 01:57:28,110
flight attendants are pilots because 
don't they isn't like flying like a form

2630
01:57:28,661 --> 01:57:31,420
of radiation.
You do get some radiation that's similar

2631
01:57:31,421 --> 01:57:32,620
to an x ray,
right?

2632
01:57:32,830 --> 01:57:34,700
Yeah,
I mean that's the full eight.

2633
01:57:34,790 --> 01:57:37,280
It's a different mechanism by how it's 
preventing it.

2634
01:57:37,290 --> 01:57:42,290
Basically eight is needed to make a 
actual precursor to dna and without that

2635
01:57:43,821 --> 01:57:45,980
precursor,
you don't make the dna right.

2636
01:57:46,070 --> 01:57:51,070
And you incorporate a nucleotide from 
rna into it and so you basically make a 

2637
01:57:51,070 --> 01:57:53,290
break in your dna strand.
But um,

2638
01:57:53,450 --> 01:57:54,710
but dna damage is,
yeah,

2639
01:57:54,711 --> 01:57:59,711
is something that happens with,
with pilots and astronauts and things 

2640
01:57:59,711 --> 01:58:01,220
like that.
And I'm had been measured.

2641
01:58:01,800 --> 01:58:02,360
Uh,
yeah,

2642
01:58:02,361 --> 01:58:07,361
it's been measured.
And if there was a really weird study 

2643
01:58:07,361 --> 01:58:09,611
that came out recently that astronauts,
they had like exceptionally longer 

2644
01:58:10,101 --> 01:58:12,650
telomeres than.
Yeah,

2645
01:58:12,680 --> 01:58:17,680
where it's like,
it was totally counter intuitive where 

2646
01:58:17,680 --> 01:58:18,620
dna damage usually causes telomeres get 
shorter.

2647
01:58:18,860 --> 01:58:20,930
And so like if you were to have asked 
me,

2648
01:58:21,470 --> 01:58:26,470
I would have predicted that the 
astronauts would have had shorter 

2649
01:58:26,470 --> 01:58:26,470
telomeres.
So,

2650
01:58:26,470 --> 01:58:27,080
so definitely some weird stuff going on.

2651
01:58:27,080 --> 01:58:29,210
We don't understand,
you know,

2652
01:58:29,211 --> 01:58:30,000
but,
um,

2653
01:58:30,540 --> 01:58:35,540
and there's obviously a variety of other
things you can do to protect yourself 

2654
01:58:35,540 --> 01:58:35,600
from that.
But I forgot why.

2655
01:58:35,660 --> 01:58:38,150
The whole point is that the 
micronutrients were important.

2656
01:58:38,540 --> 01:58:43,540
Bruce ames is,
has been my mentor and friend for many 

2657
01:58:43,540 --> 01:58:46,230
years and,
and I've sort of been in this field of 

2658
01:58:46,230 --> 01:58:46,230
study for,
for awhile and so it's,

2659
01:58:46,230 --> 01:58:46,290
it's,
it's,

2660
01:58:46,330 --> 01:58:49,540
it's how I think about food and doesn't 
mean it's the best way,

2661
01:58:49,780 --> 01:58:54,070
but it's the way that I've convinced 
myself so far with the tools that I have

2662
01:58:54,190 --> 01:58:57,160
available to me that that's how I like 
to eat.

2663
01:58:57,470 --> 01:58:58,180
Um,
and again,

2664
01:58:58,210 --> 01:59:03,210
anyone that's doing any sort of diet 
should always measure biomarkers and 

2665
01:59:03,210 --> 01:59:03,370
things like that to know if it's working
for them.

2666
01:59:03,630 --> 01:59:06,700
What's a good source of folate leafy 
greens.

2667
01:59:06,760 --> 01:59:08,070
In fact,
my bruce,

2668
01:59:08,071 --> 01:59:10,810
his mentor when he was a graduate 
student is the guy who identified,

2669
01:59:10,900 --> 01:59:13,550
he actually discovered full life by 
identifying,

2670
01:59:13,810 --> 01:59:14,920
isolating it from spinach.

2671
01:59:15,580 --> 01:59:17,070
So spanish.
Um,

2672
01:59:17,110 --> 01:59:19,440
yeah,
leafy greens are great source of fully,

2673
01:59:19,910 --> 01:59:21,400
um,
but the leafy greens,

2674
01:59:21,430 --> 01:59:22,990
like the other thing that gets me on 
this,

2675
01:59:22,991 --> 01:59:27,991
and I know I talked about this last time
was like other compounds that are in 

2676
01:59:27,991 --> 01:59:30,601
the,
in the plants where we're sort of just 

2677
01:59:30,601 --> 01:59:32,671
scratching the surface on understanding 
them like what they're doing in our 

2678
01:59:32,671 --> 01:59:32,671
bodies.
Like one for example,

2679
01:59:32,671 --> 01:59:34,960
is looting,
it's president leafy greens,

2680
01:59:34,961 --> 01:59:36,700
kales are really,
really great source of it.

2681
01:59:37,100 --> 01:59:39,400
Looting is like,
it's found in the,

2682
01:59:39,640 --> 01:59:44,640
first of all,
it was known that routine's important 

2683
01:59:44,640 --> 01:59:46,951
for the rods and cones in your eyes,
so people like they'll take supplements 

2684
01:59:46,951 --> 01:59:49,771
with ludy and to help with their vision.
But all this recent research over the 

2685
01:59:49,771 --> 01:59:53,690
last few years is found is like 
accumulating in large amounts in the 

2686
01:59:53,690 --> 01:59:54,490
brain or like what is lutein doing and 
the human brain.

2687
01:59:54,910 --> 01:59:59,910
Well,
it turns out it's like there's been 

2688
01:59:59,910 --> 01:59:59,910
clinical studies now controlled trials 
like giving people looting and,

2689
01:59:59,910 --> 02:00:00,360
and,
and,

2690
02:00:00,410 --> 02:00:02,030
and it's,
it plays a role in,

2691
02:00:02,031 --> 02:00:07,031
in cognition like people have better 
learning and memory scores after taking 

2692
02:00:07,031 --> 02:00:07,031
moodiness.

2693
02:00:07,031 --> 02:00:11,930
Um,
it's involved in a crystallized 

2694
02:00:11,930 --> 02:00:11,930
intelligence which decreases with age.
No.

2695
02:00:11,930 --> 02:00:16,260
So there's like,
there's things like that and other one 

2696
02:00:16,260 --> 02:00:16,350
is this one that I'm really interested 
in.

2697
02:00:16,360 --> 02:00:21,360
Now I'm actually supplementing with pqq 
and that one is it's made by bacteria 

2698
02:00:22,090 --> 02:00:27,090
and bacteria in the soil.
So it's made by bacteria because it's 

2699
02:00:27,090 --> 02:00:27,090
important for,
um,

2700
02:00:27,100 --> 02:00:31,290
it's a cofactor for enzymes for their 
metabolic enzymes to work well.

2701
02:00:31,300 --> 02:00:36,300
Plants take it up from soil and then we 
eat the plants and get an our diet and 

2702
02:00:36,340 --> 02:00:39,070
it's been shown now in like in a few 
studies,

2703
02:00:39,071 --> 02:00:44,071
lots and lots of preclinical studies.
It's been shown to regulate 

2704
02:00:44,071 --> 02:00:44,080
mitochondrial function,
improves mitochondrial function,

2705
02:00:44,500 --> 02:00:49,500
clinical,
a couple of clinicals trials now have 

2706
02:00:49,500 --> 02:00:49,500
been done looking at how it affects 
humans.

2707
02:00:49,500 --> 02:00:50,140
If you supplement with like 20 minutes a
day,

2708
02:00:50,500 --> 02:00:55,500
improves cognition.
It also improves markers of 

2709
02:00:55,500 --> 02:00:55,500
mitochondrial function.
Um,

2710
02:00:55,500 --> 02:00:59,640
lowers markers of inflammation will 
turns out pqq has like 20,000

2711
02:01:01,571 --> 02:01:05,810
times the catalytic activity,
um,

2712
02:01:05,860 --> 02:01:09,880
than something like ascorbic acid.
So it's a really powerful antioxidant.

2713
02:01:09,881 --> 02:01:14,881
And what I mean by that is,
so ascorbic acid goes through cycles of 

2714
02:01:14,881 --> 02:01:15,530
vitamin c,
it's,

2715
02:01:15,580 --> 02:01:17,710
it's either oxidized or reduced and it 
can,

2716
02:01:17,890 --> 02:01:18,730
it when,
when,

2717
02:01:18,820 --> 02:01:22,030
when it does this antioxidant thing,
it becomes oxidized and they can do that

2718
02:01:22,031 --> 02:01:24,010
four times where it goes,
it donates,

2719
02:01:24,400 --> 02:01:25,240
it,
donates this,

2720
02:01:25,290 --> 02:01:27,070
this hydrogen and you know,
help.

2721
02:01:27,460 --> 02:01:28,310
It helps to,
you know,

2722
02:01:28,400 --> 02:01:33,400
basically combat the oxidative stress.
But then it gets oxidized again and it 

2723
02:01:33,400 --> 02:01:36,460
can do it again four times.
Pqq does it 20,000

2724
02:01:36,461 --> 02:01:38,020
times,
like,

2725
02:01:38,021 --> 02:01:40,430
isn't that mindblowing?
Often times

2726
02:01:40,460 --> 02:01:42,440
and it's really concentrated in breast 
milk.

2727
02:01:42,770 --> 02:01:46,760
So I'm actually taking it right now.
It's super interesting.

2728
02:01:47,020 --> 02:01:48,820
It seems like something that everyone 
should supplement.

2729
02:01:50,180 --> 02:01:54,010
I think maybe so.
Yeah.

2730
02:01:54,470 --> 02:01:55,430
Because,
you know,

2731
02:01:55,890 --> 02:01:56,660
I,
you know,

2732
02:01:56,661 --> 02:01:58,180
you never really know,
but I,

2733
02:01:58,200 --> 02:02:00,680
I'm,
I'm supplementing with it and,

2734
02:02:00,770 --> 02:02:05,770
and uh,
I certainly don't notice anything 

2735
02:02:05,770 --> 02:02:10,061
because like sometimes those,
those sorts of changes are really hard 

2736
02:02:10,061 --> 02:02:10,061
to,
to measure.

2737
02:02:10,061 --> 02:02:11,540
Um,
and especially you have to wait until,

2738
02:02:11,600 --> 02:02:13,520
I mean who knows,
like later on in life,

2739
02:02:13,521 --> 02:02:18,521
but I think it may be something that's 
important that may be a,

2740
02:02:19,550 --> 02:02:22,310
has beneficial effects in humans as 
well.

2741
02:02:22,311 --> 02:02:23,600
So,
and like again,

2742
02:02:23,601 --> 02:02:25,160
you can,
you get it from plants,

2743
02:02:25,161 --> 02:02:30,161
but 20 milligrams a day is when I'm 
taking because that's what the two 

2744
02:02:30,161 --> 02:02:30,590
different clinical trials have shown.
What's the best plant source of it?

2745
02:02:31,340 --> 02:02:34,940
I don't know what the best.
I'm sure you could find that google,

2746
02:02:35,120 --> 02:02:38,810
but because various various plants take 
it up from the soil,

2747
02:02:38,840 --> 02:02:40,310
so probably things that are growing in 
the soil,

2748
02:02:40,311 --> 02:02:40,610
right?

2749
02:02:40,670 --> 02:02:42,890
That would be the best.
Um,

2750
02:02:43,010 --> 02:02:43,660
but yeah,
it's like,

2751
02:02:43,670 --> 02:02:48,670
it's found like five or six fold higher 
and higher levels that it is an art 

2752
02:02:48,670 --> 02:02:50,330
tissues and plants of course,
because the plants are the source of it.

2753
02:02:50,810 --> 02:02:51,440
Um,
but,

2754
02:02:51,470 --> 02:02:56,470
but yeah,
taking a supplemental form you'll be 

2755
02:02:56,470 --> 02:02:58,121
getting orders of magnitude more.
Do you have a supplement company that 

2756
02:02:58,121 --> 02:03:00,050
you rely on the most?
I do.

2757
02:03:00,051 --> 02:03:02,510
So the thing with supplements is that 
there's,

2758
02:03:02,850 --> 02:03:04,830
there are really risky,
uh,

2759
02:03:04,831 --> 02:03:09,831
there's lots of studies that have been 
published showing that a lot of 

2760
02:03:09,831 --> 02:03:12,371
supplements don't contain what they say 
they contain or they contain a fraction 

2761
02:03:12,371 --> 02:03:13,340
of it and they got a bunch of other 
filler like cloverleaf and stuff.

2762
02:03:13,820 --> 02:03:14,470
So,
um,

2763
02:03:14,480 --> 02:03:15,810
one of the supplement companies.
So,

2764
02:03:15,980 --> 02:03:19,250
and there's a scientist friend of mine,
his name is dr jed fay.

2765
02:03:19,251 --> 02:03:20,540
He,
he's like,

2766
02:03:20,630 --> 02:03:25,630
he's the guy who discovered that 
broccoli sprouts are the best source of 

2767
02:03:25,630 --> 02:03:25,630
sulforaphane.

2768
02:03:25,630 --> 02:03:26,180
He,
um,

2769
02:03:26,240 --> 02:03:29,600
he measured a variety of supplements and
then he was looking specifically at,

2770
02:03:29,601 --> 02:03:34,601
like precursor to sulforaphane and uh,
he looked at a variety of different 

2771
02:03:34,601 --> 02:03:37,430
companies and one of the companies that 
was just really,

2772
02:03:37,431 --> 02:03:39,890
really,
really good and reliable was thorn.

2773
02:03:40,460 --> 02:03:45,460
Thorn t h o r n e,
and that's something I don't have any 

2774
02:03:45,460 --> 02:03:46,910
affiliation with them or anything but 
that I always there my goto brand.

2775
02:03:47,330 --> 02:03:49,310
Whenever I'm looking for a supplement 
like I took,

2776
02:03:49,340 --> 02:03:51,740
I took their prenatal from throughout 
pregnancy.

2777
02:03:52,160 --> 02:03:57,160
Um,
actually I'm still taking the prenatal 

2778
02:03:57,160 --> 02:03:58,730
and breastfeeding.
I take vitamin d and vitamin k two a,

2779
02:03:58,731 --> 02:04:03,170
I take pretty much a lot of my stuff 
comes from them and the pqq,

2780
02:04:03,171 --> 02:04:04,370
however,
that,

2781
02:04:04,790 --> 02:04:09,790
um,
I've only been able to find from life 

2782
02:04:09,790 --> 02:04:11,720
extension and I think life extensions 
pretty okay so far as I can tell.

2783
02:04:11,721 --> 02:04:13,220
But thorn is like my,
my,

2784
02:04:13,250 --> 02:04:15,950
my favorite company,
uh,

2785
02:04:15,951 --> 02:04:19,710
so far just because I've got data from a
scientist that I,

2786
02:04:19,970 --> 02:04:24,970
that I trust is a difficult issue and 
tainted supplements a or a huge problem 

2787
02:04:25,971 --> 02:04:30,971
with athletes.
A lot of false positives are not even 

2788
02:04:30,971 --> 02:04:31,730
false positives.
A lot of athletes will take supplements,

2789
02:04:31,731 --> 02:04:34,400
like if they go to like some just 
generic vitamin store,

2790
02:04:34,420 --> 02:04:39,420
you know,
whatever name the name and they pick up 

2791
02:04:39,420 --> 02:04:39,420
some of a creatine

2792
02:04:39,420 --> 02:04:43,700
or muscle enhancer or this or that.
And a lot of them are tainted with 

2793
02:04:43,700 --> 02:04:47,121
steroids or they're used in the same 
labs or created rather than the same 

2794
02:04:47,121 --> 02:04:50,300
labs and they don't clean the bins.
And so like the vats,

2795
02:04:50,390 --> 02:04:55,390
they used to mix up one supplement will 
the whatever was in residual traces of 

2796
02:04:56,401 --> 02:04:58,920
it will wind up in some other stuff.
It's a real issue.

2797
02:04:59,160 --> 02:05:02,010
I think there's um,
what you were referring to there.

2798
02:05:02,430 --> 02:05:05,970
A lot of supplement companies that have 
a stamp on it called nsf,

2799
02:05:05,971 --> 02:05:07,800
which is the national sanitary 
foundation.

2800
02:05:07,801 --> 02:05:12,801
I believe they go and they investigate 
where the supplements manufactured and 

2801
02:05:13,651 --> 02:05:17,240
they look at the quality and they also,
I think even look at some,

2802
02:05:17,260 --> 02:05:19,260
some of the what's in the supplements if
the,

2803
02:05:19,261 --> 02:05:21,990
if they contain what they're supposed to
contain to some degree.

2804
02:05:21,991 --> 02:05:26,991
But I know they definitely look at the 
manufacturing place to see if things 

2805
02:05:26,991 --> 02:05:27,210
like that were,
you know,

2806
02:05:27,211 --> 02:05:29,310
things aren't being cleaned right in.
There's contamination,

2807
02:05:29,311 --> 02:05:31,630
all that.
So supplements that have that stamp

2808
02:05:31,720 --> 02:05:34,420
probably a little more reliable than 
ones that don't.

2809
02:05:34,780 --> 02:05:37,690
But it's still not like a sure thing.
Right.

2810
02:05:37,700 --> 02:05:40,420
And so it's not like it just because it 
has that stamp,

2811
02:05:40,421 --> 02:05:41,440
it's,
it's going to be the best,

2812
02:05:42,040 --> 02:05:47,040
I think a lot of people listening to 
this and they're going to probably have 

2813
02:05:47,040 --> 02:05:49,501
to listen to three or four times and 
take notes and go over this and try to 

2814
02:05:49,501 --> 02:05:49,501
figure out if they're going to do 
something,

2815
02:05:49,501 --> 02:05:54,331
how to act.
A lot of people have a hard time 

2816
02:05:54,331 --> 02:05:57,661
digesting all of this data and trying to
figure out what is the best way to 

2817
02:05:57,661 --> 02:06:01,531
proceed in terms of investigating their 
own health and monitoring their blood 

2818
02:06:02,501 --> 02:06:05,680
levels and,
and trying to find a primary care doctor

2819
02:06:05,681 --> 02:06:07,330
that will kind of understand what 
they're trying to do.

2820
02:06:07,750 --> 02:06:09,250
Yeah,
I mean the,

2821
02:06:09,370 --> 02:06:11,620
the,
the primary care doctor thing,

2822
02:06:11,621 --> 02:06:13,840
finding one.
I certainly can't help with that because

2823
02:06:13,870 --> 02:06:15,550
I mean that's the struggle that you and 
I have,

2824
02:06:15,551 --> 02:06:17,890
but you know,
in terms of taking,

2825
02:06:17,920 --> 02:06:21,630
taking your health into your own hands 
and monitoring blood biomarkers.

2826
02:06:21,640 --> 02:06:24,430
I mean there's a,
there's a few that are really,

2827
02:06:24,640 --> 02:06:26,950
really key I think for anyone doing 
anything,

2828
02:06:26,980 --> 02:06:29,530
any type of experimentation that,
that they should do.

2829
02:06:29,531 --> 02:06:31,030
And we've,
we've talked about them already.

2830
02:06:31,031 --> 02:06:31,490
You know,
the,

2831
02:06:31,550 --> 02:06:34,030
the small dense ldl,
the total ldl,

2832
02:06:34,330 --> 02:06:37,150
you also want to measure triglycerides,
high sensitivity,

2833
02:06:37,151 --> 02:06:39,580
c reactive protein or hb,
one hba,

2834
02:06:39,581 --> 02:06:44,581
one c,
which is the marker of longterm fasting 

2835
02:06:44,581 --> 02:06:47,401
blood glucose.
But also there's another test that you 

2836
02:06:47,401 --> 02:06:49,840
can do that actually is a really 
comprehensive metabolic tests to measure

2837
02:06:50,170 --> 02:06:52,540
how your body is metabolizing 
carbohydrates,

2838
02:06:52,541 --> 02:06:57,541
fatty acids and amino acids.
It's called the organic acid test and 

2839
02:06:57,541 --> 02:07:02,191
genova diagnostics offers it and 
unfortunately you do have to get your 

2840
02:07:02,410 --> 02:07:07,410
primary care physician to prescribe or 
order that because that's not something 

2841
02:07:07,410 --> 02:07:07,900
that's,
that's,

2842
02:07:07,920 --> 02:07:09,040
uh,
available to

2843
02:07:09,240 --> 02:07:14,240
people.
But it seems like there's room for a 

2844
02:07:14,240 --> 02:07:16,041
company to do this,
like a one stop shop company that sort 

2845
02:07:16,041 --> 02:07:18,570
of analyzes your health and prescribed 
to you,

2846
02:07:18,630 --> 02:07:23,630
you know,
explains to you what's lacking in your 

2847
02:07:23,630 --> 02:07:23,920
diet and what you could benefit from and
what you can.

2848
02:07:23,930 --> 02:07:26,520
And it seems like there's a,
there's a big opening for some sort of a

2849
02:07:26,521 --> 02:07:27,330
business like that.

2850
02:07:27,670 --> 02:07:28,120
Yeah,
I mean,

2851
02:07:28,121 --> 02:07:29,620
I think some people are actually doing 
it.

2852
02:07:29,621 --> 02:07:32,620
Like genova diagnostics I think is one.
They do sort of do that.

2853
02:07:32,621 --> 02:07:37,621
Like they'll,
they'll tell you what's missing or like 

2854
02:07:37,621 --> 02:07:37,621
the help interpret

2855
02:07:37,621 --> 02:07:41,220
your data and genova diagnostics.
And is it a nationwide company?

2856
02:07:42,970 --> 02:07:43,720
Nationwide?
Yeah,

2857
02:07:43,721 --> 02:07:47,170
but I don't know about worldwide.
So if you're in europe.

2858
02:07:47,970 --> 02:07:48,630
Yeah,
yeah.

2859
02:07:48,670 --> 02:07:51,190
So,
but I think there's other companies that

2860
02:07:51,191 --> 02:07:56,191
are kind of wellness effects,
kind of is doing that a little bit as 

2861
02:07:56,191 --> 02:07:59,311
well.
They give you a consult with someone 

2862
02:07:59,311 --> 02:07:59,860
after you get a variety of blood markers
measured and you know,

2863
02:07:59,880 --> 02:08:02,440
that we try to help you figure out that 
as well.

2864
02:08:02,441 --> 02:08:03,660
And uh,
you know,

2865
02:08:03,690 --> 02:08:04,630
so it's,
it's certainly,

2866
02:08:04,631 --> 02:08:09,631
I think there's other people,
it's just a matter of finding a good 

2867
02:08:09,631 --> 02:08:09,631
one.
It's always the,

2868
02:08:10,060 --> 02:08:10,960
the catch,
right.

2869
02:08:11,210 --> 02:08:14,650
It seems like with this kind of stuff 
for the average consumer,

2870
02:08:14,651 --> 02:08:17,500
the average person listening to this,
it seems very daunting.

2871
02:08:17,530 --> 02:08:18,670
It's like,
boy,

2872
02:08:18,671 --> 02:08:20,280
there's so much to think about.
There's so.

2873
02:08:20,320 --> 02:08:23,620
I mean in a lot of times when people get
inundated with that much data,

2874
02:08:23,621 --> 02:08:25,380
they sort of shut down,
let it go.

2875
02:08:25,380 --> 02:08:26,860
This is just,
I can't do this,

2876
02:08:26,970 --> 02:08:31,970
this is too much.
And I really wish there was like a 

2877
02:08:31,970 --> 02:08:36,620
nationwide network of places like this 
where you could just go to sort of like 

2878
02:08:36,620 --> 02:08:37,170
you can go to,
you know,

2879
02:08:37,240 --> 02:08:42,240
a dentist,
there should be like a place where you 

2880
02:08:42,240 --> 02:08:44,221
can go to to get this kind of 
comprehensive information about your 

2881
02:08:44,221 --> 02:08:46,840
diet and the effects on your body and 
what genes you have.

2882
02:08:46,841 --> 02:08:51,270
And the problem is we're still figuring 
out all those nuances and so,

2883
02:08:51,610 --> 02:08:54,160
you know,
even even getting the data,

2884
02:08:54,161 --> 02:08:55,720
having the person interpret it,
it's,

2885
02:08:55,870 --> 02:09:00,870
you know,
it's constantly evolving and you would 

2886
02:09:00,870 --> 02:09:00,870
have to have someone who's completely on
top of it all the time.

2887
02:09:00,870 --> 02:09:05,671
So we'd have to be like sending them do 
literature constantly because we're 

2888
02:09:05,671 --> 02:09:10,110
constantly changing the way we think 
about a variety of things and seem like 

2889
02:09:10,110 --> 02:09:14,250
some billionaire dude would look one of 
hire you up and have them like have you 

2890
02:09:14,471 --> 02:09:19,471
watch over them all the time and monitor
their blood and try to figure out what 

2891
02:09:19,471 --> 02:09:19,840
they're doing wrong and prescribe things
to them.

2892
02:09:20,590 --> 02:09:22,230
Monitor their blood,
give them youngblood.

2893
02:09:22,250 --> 02:09:23,860
Yeah.
Some george soros type of care.

2894
02:09:24,460 --> 02:09:26,920
Is that real?
That young blood thing.

2895
02:09:26,921 --> 02:09:28,570
Because I know that's a real thing with 
mice,

2896
02:09:28,571 --> 02:09:29,890
but are they really doing that with 
people?

2897
02:09:29,891 --> 02:09:31,990
Because I had heard that peter teal had 
done it,

2898
02:09:32,200 --> 02:09:34,360
but then he says it's bullshit.
He's never done it.

2899
02:09:34,690 --> 02:09:36,530
Oh really?
Yes.

2900
02:09:37,040 --> 02:09:38,620
Find that jamie.
Peter teal.

2901
02:09:38,650 --> 02:09:41,190
Denies ever get injected with young 
blood.

2902
02:09:41,470 --> 02:09:46,470
Get to know they're there.
I know that the clinical trials that 

2903
02:09:46,470 --> 02:09:50,581
were done at stanford,
I don't know if they'd been established 

2904
02:09:50,581 --> 02:09:50,590
yet.
Fuck no.

2905
02:09:50,591 --> 02:09:55,591
Peter teals,
not harvesting the blood of the picture 

2906
02:09:55,591 --> 02:09:58,190
of him with stories of cow.
Countess is bathing and virgin blood 

2907
02:10:02,800 --> 02:10:07,800
vampyr ignoble.
Suck the juice out of the young have 

2908
02:10:07,800 --> 02:10:10,051
captured our attention for centuries 
when the story's coming out of the tech 

2909
02:10:10,051 --> 02:10:13,261
billionaire peter teal was interested in
transfusing the blood into his own body 

2910
02:10:13,261 --> 02:10:13,261
scent.

2911
02:10:13,261 --> 02:10:13,660
Silicon valley to a fever dream.
But,

2912
02:10:13,840 --> 02:10:18,840
but there is something.
So there's a company that does this.

2913
02:10:19,090 --> 02:10:19,570
Oh,
is there?

2914
02:10:19,571 --> 02:10:22,150
I didn't know that there was a northern 
California company,

2915
02:10:22,151 --> 02:10:27,151
a startup that does this and see if he 
can find that so that that is a real 

2916
02:10:28,810 --> 02:10:33,810
pair of meiosis is what it's called.
And there's this anti aging is charging 

2917
02:10:34,011 --> 02:10:36,490
thousands of dollars for teen blood.
Look at this kid.

2918
02:10:36,760 --> 02:10:38,180
Kids probably high on ecstasy,
right?

2919
02:10:38,181 --> 02:10:42,920
They're always given up his blood.
So they take this young person's blood.

2920
02:10:43,660 --> 02:10:46,070
It says like plot points from hbo.
Silicon valley.

2921
02:10:46,730 --> 02:10:47,930
Peter teal.
Yeah.

2922
02:10:47,931 --> 02:10:49,730
Just ask peter teal.
Incredible.

2923
02:10:49,820 --> 02:10:54,820
Well it says no.
He saying I'm looking into parabiosis 

2924
02:10:54,820 --> 02:10:54,980
stuff,
which I think is really interesting.

2925
02:10:55,580 --> 02:10:59,480
This is where the sea,
he probably is looking into it.

2926
02:10:59,481 --> 02:11:04,481
He just hasn't done it because he's 
probably waiting to see if someone 

2927
02:11:04,481 --> 02:11:04,481
starts growing a foot on her head.

2928
02:11:04,570 --> 02:11:09,570
Jesse a karmazin karmazin karmazin 
agrees his startup ambrosia is charging 

2929
02:11:10,821 --> 02:11:11,780
what?
$8,000

2930
02:11:11,781 --> 02:11:16,781
a pop.
Expensive for blood transfusions from 

2931
02:11:16,781 --> 02:11:18,980
people under 25.
He said at code conference on wednesday.

2932
02:11:18,981 --> 02:11:22,220
Ambrosia.
Which buys it's blood from blood banks.

2933
02:11:22,221 --> 02:11:23,390
Now.
How's about 100?

2934
02:11:23,420 --> 02:11:24,860
Okay.
Buying his book.

2935
02:11:25,040 --> 02:11:28,350
So they must specify who the people are.
Now when you go to the blood bank,

2936
02:11:28,351 --> 02:11:33,351
how do they even know?
Like what the fuck you've been doing 

2937
02:11:33,351 --> 02:11:33,351
with your body?
I'm wondering.

2938
02:11:33,351 --> 02:11:36,170
I mean I know they monitor for certain 
disease like diseases and stuff.

2939
02:11:36,171 --> 02:11:36,680
They're like,
well,

2940
02:11:36,681 --> 02:11:38,480
no,
but it's like all the other nuances,

2941
02:11:38,481 --> 02:11:39,710
all the other stuff.
I don't,

2942
02:11:39,770 --> 02:11:42,140
I don't.
Sugar and candy and bullshit.

2943
02:11:44,270 --> 02:11:46,940
Is that a that represented in your 
blood?

2944
02:11:47,370 --> 02:11:52,370
Uh,
I mean there's certain biomarkers that 

2945
02:11:52,370 --> 02:11:52,370
you can.
Yeah,

2946
02:11:52,370 --> 02:11:55,541
you can absolutely measure and you can 
certainly look at telomere length or 

2947
02:11:55,541 --> 02:11:55,541
length,
dna damage,

2948
02:11:55,541 --> 02:11:57,410
things like that.
I just have a joke about dick cheney.

2949
02:11:57,610 --> 02:12:00,650
Dick cheney had an extra secret service 
agent that they put on this,

2950
02:12:00,651 --> 02:12:04,080
like super healthy diet and he couldn't 
figure it out and you know,

2951
02:12:04,360 --> 02:12:06,260
who would have to run when everybody 
else did everything.

2952
02:12:06,261 --> 02:12:08,660
He was just really there in case dick 
had a heart attack.

2953
02:12:08,661 --> 02:12:11,380
They're going to cut this guy open like 
a fish or pull his organs out,

2954
02:12:12,730 --> 02:12:14,960
give dick his heart.
But this is,

2955
02:12:15,210 --> 02:12:16,760
I mean this is what you would want sort 
of.

2956
02:12:16,761 --> 02:12:18,260
You'd want someone like,
okay,

2957
02:12:18,261 --> 02:12:20,120
I want your blood,
I'm going to pay you for your blood,

2958
02:12:20,121 --> 02:12:21,860
but look,
can't be drinking.

2959
02:12:22,040 --> 02:12:23,330
No smoking,
no sugar,

2960
02:12:23,331 --> 02:12:23,930
no bullshit.

2961
02:12:23,990 --> 02:12:28,990
You'd have to monitor them like you 
would like someone like the surrogate 

2962
02:12:28,990 --> 02:12:29,330
moms.
Exactly fresh,

2963
02:12:29,340 --> 02:12:31,940
but you'd have to.
They'd have to live with me,

2964
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:36,520
I'd have doing them right.
Well this is,

2965
02:12:36,530 --> 02:12:39,740
and this will be up and coming.
It's not just fresh blood.

2966
02:12:40,220 --> 02:12:43,670
So for people listening,
they don't know transplanting blood from

2967
02:12:43,671 --> 02:12:46,700
young animals into old animals like 
rejuvenate's their brain.

2968
02:12:46,701 --> 02:12:48,540
It makes them live longer,
do rejuvenate's,

2969
02:12:48,550 --> 02:12:50,180
all their organized so like they're 
healthier.

2970
02:12:50,181 --> 02:12:52,100
And conversely,
and conversely,

2971
02:12:52,101 --> 02:12:55,400
putting the old blood into young animals
messes them up,

2972
02:12:55,980 --> 02:13:00,980
makes them age basically.
It makes them perform worse cognitively 

2973
02:13:00,980 --> 02:13:02,300
and all that stuff.
He's got somethings gonna pull up here.

2974
02:13:02,870 --> 02:13:06,290
It's saying they found it in one test 
that it might have worked,

2975
02:13:06,320 --> 02:13:08,750
but it hasn't been replicated in these 
two paragraphs.

2976
02:13:08,751 --> 02:13:11,840
Say that it might not even be true.
Which one interesting.

2977
02:13:12,040 --> 02:13:17,040
So some aspects of aging.
The 2013 study found could be reversed 

2978
02:13:17,040 --> 02:13:19,010
when older mice get blood from younger 
ones,

2979
02:13:19,011 --> 02:13:24,011
but other researchers have haven't been 
able to replicate these results and the 

2980
02:13:24,011 --> 02:13:24,660
benefits of para biosis and humans 
remains on.

2981
02:13:25,070 --> 02:13:27,290
I remember that what happened was they 
didn't,

2982
02:13:27,350 --> 02:13:32,350
they couldn't replicate the mechanism.
They thought it was this growth factor 

2983
02:13:32,350 --> 02:13:32,350
called bdnf

2984
02:13:32,350 --> 02:13:32,880
and they're like,
oh,

2985
02:13:32,910 --> 02:13:35,970
that's not replicatable,
like that's not what's doing it.

2986
02:13:36,330 --> 02:13:41,330
And then this other study came out 
showing that you could transplant the 

2987
02:13:41,330 --> 02:13:41,940
old blood into the young and it would 
reverse the effects.

2988
02:13:41,941 --> 02:13:44,040
And so now scientists are going,
oh,

2989
02:13:44,041 --> 02:13:48,270
is it that the young blood is a 
rejuvenating or is that the old blood is

2990
02:13:48,600 --> 02:13:49,980
accelerating the aging.
Right.

2991
02:13:50,210 --> 02:13:52,130
See the difference though?
So that's kind of like,

2992
02:13:52,140 --> 02:13:54,270
I think we're,
it's possibly at now,

2993
02:13:54,780 --> 02:13:59,780
but um,
I was gonna just mention to you that 

2994
02:13:59,780 --> 02:14:02,181
microbiome that's heading there as well.
Like there was a preliminary study that 

2995
02:14:02,181 --> 02:14:06,141
was published not long ago in kill fish 
were that the microbiome from young fish

2996
02:14:06,571 --> 02:14:11,571
was transplanted in the old fish and it 
extended their lifespan by like 40 

2997
02:14:11,571 --> 02:14:11,571
percent.
Whoa.

2998
02:14:11,810 --> 02:14:14,520
You take the microbiome from a young 
person,

2999
02:14:14,640 --> 02:14:17,650
like my son breeze it down.
Yeah.

3000
02:14:17,680 --> 02:14:18,570
So,
well,

3001
02:14:18,571 --> 02:14:19,740
it's funny because,
um,

3002
02:14:19,830 --> 02:14:22,110
they think the mechanism has to do with 
the immune system.

3003
02:14:22,110 --> 02:14:27,110
Remember I was telling you,
your microbiome makes these short chain 

3004
02:14:27,110 --> 02:14:27,460
fatty acids and it totally regulates 
your immune system.

3005
02:14:27,810 --> 02:14:28,370
You know,
you,

3006
02:14:28,440 --> 02:14:30,650
it regulates the amount of um,
you know,

3007
02:14:30,720 --> 02:14:33,240
a variety of different immune cells that
you're making.

3008
02:14:33,510 --> 02:14:38,510
And so like hamata police,
this is one which is making new blood 

3009
02:14:38,510 --> 02:14:41,181
cells and there's been studies that have
looked at the microbiome of like really 

3010
02:14:41,181 --> 02:14:44,580
healthy 90 year olds and they look like 
the microbiome looks like,

3011
02:14:44,610 --> 02:14:47,610
like a 30 year old even though these are
90 year old people.

3012
02:14:47,611 --> 02:14:50,580
So usually the microbiomes vastly 
different in older people.

3013
02:14:50,640 --> 02:14:54,350
But these healthy 90 year olds obviously
they're healthy if they make it to 90,

3014
02:14:54,351 --> 02:14:56,580
it's not,
that's not an average age of most people

3015
02:14:56,581 --> 02:14:59,670
make it to their microbiomes looked like
a,

3016
02:14:59,700 --> 02:15:01,530
like a 30 year old,
which is super interesting.

3017
02:15:01,800 --> 02:15:04,020
So it's a whole new.
I think we're going to start to see like

3018
02:15:04,021 --> 02:15:09,021
kind of like the of biosis.
It's like the microbiome microbiome 

3019
02:15:09,021 --> 02:15:09,021
transplant.
That's it.

3020
02:15:09,021 --> 02:15:09,021
Yeah.

3021
02:15:12,660 --> 02:15:17,190
I love headlines or they break headlines
down and just get you to click on it.

3022
02:15:17,220 --> 02:15:18,480
Will pope's the easiest,
right.

3023
02:15:18,481 --> 02:15:19,920
Because now it's like,
you know,

3024
02:15:19,921 --> 02:15:20,910
and they're doing these,
these,

3025
02:15:20,940 --> 02:15:23,950
these capsules now or they're taking 
poop.

3026
02:15:24,540 --> 02:15:29,540
Yeah.
And it's like helping people with their 

3027
02:15:29,540 --> 02:15:30,360
ibs and of course,
like I think the problem was like making

3028
02:15:30,361 --> 02:15:35,361
sure it doesn't taste like shit when 
it's going down on me because like the 

3029
02:15:35,361 --> 02:15:35,361
capsule cannot pronounce,
just makes it was sugar.

3030
02:15:35,361 --> 02:15:36,700
And then you've got other problems,
right?

3031
02:15:37,650 --> 02:15:41,010
A spoonful of sugar makes a poop.
I know it's,

3032
02:15:41,150 --> 02:15:42,180
it's,
it's crazy.

3033
02:15:42,270 --> 02:15:44,490
What do you think about steve?
You stay like,

3034
02:15:44,510 --> 02:15:46,050
so the stevia,
um,

3035
02:15:46,640 --> 02:15:47,370
there's,
it's,

3036
02:15:47,400 --> 02:15:49,800
it's a non-nutritive sweetener.
So it's not like,

3037
02:15:49,980 --> 02:15:54,870
it's not like a aspartame or sacrifice 
or what's the other one is sucralose,

3038
02:15:55,080 --> 02:15:55,830
which,
by the way,

3039
02:15:55,831 --> 02:15:58,230
those have all been shown to like screw 
up the microbiome.

3040
02:15:58,680 --> 02:15:59,880
Yeah,
those are really bad.

3041
02:15:59,910 --> 02:16:04,910
Yeah.
They like changed the scope is what the 

3042
02:16:04,910 --> 02:16:08,001
president drinks 12 cans a day of.
No wonder why he's making shit 

3043
02:16:08,001 --> 02:16:09,370
decisions.
12.

3044
02:16:09,600 --> 02:16:10,680
Are you serious?
Yeah.

3045
02:16:10,681 --> 02:16:15,440
So New York times story,
they said that he drinks 12 cans of diet

3046
02:16:15,450 --> 02:16:19,140
coke a day and watches as much as eight 
hours of television a day.

3047
02:16:19,710 --> 02:16:20,760
So he's,
he's,

3048
02:16:20,820 --> 02:16:24,780
he's literally like a test monkey.
Is that really true?

3049
02:16:25,630 --> 02:16:27,210
That's crazy.
It's really true.

3050
02:16:27,211 --> 02:16:30,270
See if you can find that article,
12 cans of beer.

3051
02:16:30,290 --> 02:16:35,290
It is.
Trump reportedly drinks 12 cans of diet 

3052
02:16:35,290 --> 02:16:38,551
coke.
It looks like you're losing it using an 

3053
02:16:38,551 --> 02:16:38,551
ad blocker.
That's the main,

3054
02:16:38,551 --> 02:16:40,390
um,
the main sweetener in diet coke.

3055
02:16:40,600 --> 02:16:41,950
Aspartame.
Aspartame,

3056
02:16:41,951 --> 02:16:45,520
yeah.
Trump drinks 12 diet cokes per day.

3057
02:16:46,060 --> 02:16:51,060
What can that do to a person's body?
And then they have a scientists thought 

3058
02:16:51,060 --> 02:16:55,410
we're fucked.
I'll tell you what it does to the 

3059
02:16:55,410 --> 02:16:55,410
microbiome changes the composition so 
that you're like,

3060
02:16:55,410 --> 02:16:56,920
you're,
you're getting the kind of bacteria that

3061
02:16:56,921 --> 02:16:59,080
are really good at harvesting the 
glucose from,

3062
02:16:59,350 --> 02:17:01,150
from like the small intestine area.

3063
02:17:01,390 --> 02:17:06,390
And it makes people become obese.
Like that's the associative studies and 

3064
02:17:06,390 --> 02:17:07,360
people like that.
They've shown that in people.

3065
02:17:07,361 --> 02:17:09,400
And then of course they've done causal 
studies in animals showing that.

3066
02:17:09,401 --> 02:17:12,340
But stevia is interesting because,
um,

3067
02:17:12,850 --> 02:17:17,850
I've seen positive studies with that 
where it seems to improve insulin 

3068
02:17:17,850 --> 02:17:18,070
sensitivity,
which is kind of weird.

3069
02:17:19,120 --> 02:17:21,820
I,
I personally am always,

3070
02:17:21,890 --> 02:17:23,460
um,
I,

3071
02:17:23,800 --> 02:17:24,970
I,
I'll use stevia.

3072
02:17:24,971 --> 02:17:29,971
Like if I'm like gonna,
let's make some hot cocoa with 100 

3073
02:17:29,971 --> 02:17:30,190
percent cocoa and it just tastes like 
ass.

3074
02:17:30,191 --> 02:17:31,490
And I'm like,
I need some stevia.

3075
02:17:32,160 --> 02:17:34,210
It's like otherwise you're just doing a 
shot of it.

3076
02:17:34,220 --> 02:17:39,220
Like hot cocoa with no sugar is 100 
percent cocoa or cacao.

3077
02:17:40,870 --> 02:17:42,340
There's all sorts of benefits with that 
too.

3078
02:17:42,341 --> 02:17:43,360
But.
But yeah,

3079
02:17:43,361 --> 02:17:45,250
with this I don't really use a lot of 
stevia.

3080
02:17:45,251 --> 02:17:47,500
Like my,
my inlaws they,

3081
02:17:47,530 --> 02:17:52,530
they like to put it in their smoothies 
because I've gotten so used to my 

3082
02:17:52,530 --> 02:17:53,680
smoothies,
tasting kaylee that I guess,

3083
02:17:53,681 --> 02:17:54,390
you know,
and,

3084
02:17:54,480 --> 02:17:59,480
and plus I don't eat any,
anything sweet so I don't really need 

3085
02:17:59,480 --> 02:17:59,480
it.

3086
02:17:59,480 --> 02:18:00,160
But they like to put it in their 
smoothies and you know,

3087
02:18:00,970 --> 02:18:02,920
I don't,
I don't know if it has any.

3088
02:18:02,950 --> 02:18:05,800
We haven't really seen negative health 
consequences with the exception.

3089
02:18:05,801 --> 02:18:10,801
I think there was one study in rats 
where they gave him like exceptional 

3090
02:18:10,801 --> 02:18:13,570
amounts and it like changed the,
the hormonal profile or something.

3091
02:18:13,750 --> 02:18:17,020
So I didn't consume any during pregnancy
because I was worried about that.

3092
02:18:17,070 --> 02:18:21,790
But um,
we'll don't be a rat study study,

3093
02:18:21,791 --> 02:18:26,791
but I think that's probably my choice.
If I were to sweeten something like my 

3094
02:18:26,791 --> 02:18:31,050
put it in my coffee or something,
I'd put stevia with trump is grossly 

3095
02:18:31,050 --> 02:18:31,480
overweight.
So the microbiome,

3096
02:18:31,481 --> 02:18:35,290
what's funny is that people are taking 
diet coke or trying or they're trying to

3097
02:18:35,291 --> 02:18:36,410
like improve.
They don't,

3098
02:18:36,430 --> 02:18:38,770
they don't,
they don't want the refined sugar.

3099
02:18:38,980 --> 02:18:43,980
They don't want to have the,
the constant insulin response and so 

3100
02:18:43,980 --> 02:18:44,980
they're drinking the diet coke.
It's kind of ironic that it's like,

3101
02:18:45,400 --> 02:18:50,370
it's like making them more be obese by 
changing the gut microbiome know is,

3102
02:18:50,430 --> 02:18:54,070
is it safe to drink just one can every 
now and again or it's just something you

3103
02:18:54,640 --> 02:18:56,770
can every now and then it's okay.
You know,

3104
02:18:56,771 --> 02:19:01,771
it's not.
I mean that's not going to like 

3105
02:19:01,771 --> 02:19:01,771
completely not 12 cans a day or even one
candidate.

3106
02:19:01,771 --> 02:19:03,400
You're constantly under certain your 
microbiome.

3107
02:19:03,401 --> 02:19:06,010
You're constantly going to keep shifting
it in towards,

3108
02:19:06,011 --> 02:19:08,860
you know,
the one Canada probably.

3109
02:19:08,861 --> 02:19:09,880
Yeah,
because it's.

3110
02:19:09,940 --> 02:19:11,420
The microbiome is.
Yeah.

3111
02:19:13,660 --> 02:19:15,460
Diet coke,
diet coke.

3112
02:19:15,550 --> 02:19:19,660
I haven't had diet.
Coke was like 2006.

3113
02:19:20,500 --> 02:19:22,800
I had one yesterday and the hotel 
cracked it open.

3114
02:19:22,820 --> 02:19:24,100
Really?
I haven't,

3115
02:19:24,130 --> 02:19:27,550
I really haven't had one since 2006.
I used to drink,

3116
02:19:27,551 --> 02:19:28,730
um,
I used to drink them,

3117
02:19:28,790 --> 02:19:30,650
um,
when,

3118
02:19:30,850 --> 02:19:35,850
uh,
for lightened college and stuff to stay 

3119
02:19:35,850 --> 02:19:38,081
awake and study for exams and all that.
But if you're taking something like 

3120
02:19:38,081 --> 02:19:38,081
that,
um,

3121
02:19:38,081 --> 02:19:42,520
should you take a corresponding like 
some sort of a probiotic to try to 

3122
02:19:42,520 --> 02:19:45,350
combat that?
I mean the problem with that is,

3123
02:19:45,380 --> 02:19:47,270
you know,
the probiotics,

3124
02:19:47,480 --> 02:19:50,060
which by the way,
there's all sorts of interesting studies

3125
02:19:50,061 --> 02:19:52,670
that have shown effectiveness of certain
probiotics that are,

3126
02:19:52,690 --> 02:19:55,430
you know,
have a lot of that or have live bacteria

3127
02:19:55,431 --> 02:19:57,640
and a lot of them.
But you know,

3128
02:19:57,770 --> 02:20:02,770
in order for the probiotics to work,
you either have to constantly take them 

3129
02:20:02,770 --> 02:20:05,690
or there needs to be space in your gut 
for them to take residence in.

3130
02:20:05,690 --> 02:20:08,120
Right?
So if you're like filling your body with

3131
02:20:08,121 --> 02:20:09,980
all sorts of sugar or diet coke and all 
this,

3132
02:20:09,981 --> 02:20:12,660
then where,
where's the probiotic that you,

3133
02:20:12,680 --> 02:20:14,840
you're taking in gonna attach,
right?

3134
02:20:14,990 --> 02:20:18,080
So it's kind of flow through and the 
flow through that has benefits,

3135
02:20:18,081 --> 02:20:19,990
but you have to keep taking it,
you know,

3136
02:20:20,030 --> 02:20:21,530
for that.
For that to happen.

3137
02:20:21,531 --> 02:20:24,110
So the,
so really a healthy diet is the way it's

3138
02:20:24,111 --> 02:20:29,111
not,
you can't just counteract with 

3139
02:20:29,111 --> 02:20:29,111
supplementation.
You're healthy,

3140
02:20:29,111 --> 02:20:29,111
healthy diets the way meaning,
you know,

3141
02:20:29,111 --> 02:20:29,560
the,
the,

3142
02:20:29,620 --> 02:20:32,240
the fermentable fiber which is what 
helps grow,

3143
02:20:32,360 --> 02:20:36,440
helps the commensal and good bacteria 
basically grow and thrive.

3144
02:20:36,860 --> 02:20:38,930
But um,
probiotics helped me a lot.

3145
02:20:38,960 --> 02:20:41,310
Like after I had some,
I had some gut issues from,

3146
02:20:41,340 --> 02:20:44,270
from stress with graduate school,
graduate school.

3147
02:20:44,271 --> 02:20:47,510
And so that definitely helped me.
And um,

3148
02:20:47,511 --> 02:20:48,350
I don't,
I,

3149
02:20:48,490 --> 02:20:50,030
I take them once in awhile now,
like,

3150
02:20:50,120 --> 02:20:50,900
you know,
but I don't,

3151
02:20:50,930 --> 02:20:55,930
I don't take them everyday like I did 
when I was like trying to like kill 

3152
02:20:55,930 --> 02:20:55,930
myself.

3153
02:20:55,930 --> 02:20:55,930
Um,
and,

3154
02:20:55,930 --> 02:21:00,560
and the one I was taking,
I think we've talked about this $450 

3155
02:21:00,560 --> 02:21:00,860
million.
It's called vsl number three,

3156
02:21:00,861 --> 02:21:05,861
but now there's another company called 
[inaudible] biome that is like the guy 

3157
02:21:05,861 --> 02:21:09,161
who made [inaudible] vsl number three is
doing this is by all make the same 

3158
02:21:09,161 --> 02:21:09,650
formulation.
I've tried it out as well.

3159
02:21:09,870 --> 02:21:14,870
Um,
but it's like a little cheaper anD I 

3160
02:21:14,870 --> 02:21:14,870
don't have any affiliation with either 
of those companies,

3161
02:21:14,870 --> 02:21:18,791
but theRe's been clinical clinical 
studies with both of them showing 

3162
02:21:18,791 --> 02:21:18,791
effectiveness.
and so,

3163
02:21:18,791 --> 02:21:19,140
um,
it's,

3164
02:21:19,141 --> 02:21:24,141
it's certainly an interesting field 
growing field and there happens in the 

3165
02:21:24,161 --> 02:21:26,390
clinical studies in humans where,
for example,

3166
02:21:26,720 --> 02:21:29,570
the one that's super interesting,
the brain,

3167
02:21:29,600 --> 02:21:34,600
the brain stuff,
the way it's affecting the brain is 

3168
02:21:34,600 --> 02:21:34,600
interesting.
And there's clinical studies.

3169
02:21:34,600 --> 02:21:37,691
There was one recent one I thinK I 
tweeted where there was like 10 

3170
02:21:37,691 --> 02:21:40,811
randomized controlled trials.
They weren't really high quality but 

3171
02:21:40,811 --> 02:21:42,530
it's a start and it improved measures of
anxiety and people,

3172
02:21:43,190 --> 02:21:48,190
other studies have shown in randomized 
controlled trials have been a couple of 

3173
02:21:48,190 --> 02:21:50,180
others showing it improves depression 
scores and also in cognition.

3174
02:21:50,480 --> 02:21:51,220
So tHere's,
you know,

3175
02:21:51,250 --> 02:21:56,250
again,
immune system modulation of the immune 

3176
02:21:56,250 --> 02:21:56,300
system will affect the brain immune 
system.

3177
02:21:56,360 --> 02:21:58,040
It definitely is kind of,
you know,

3178
02:21:58,041 --> 02:22:03,041
basically inflammatory factors and 
things like that can cross over to the 

3179
02:22:03,041 --> 02:22:06,370
blood brain barrier and getting the 
brain and disrupt neurotransmitter 

3180
02:22:06,370 --> 02:22:10,190
production and all sorts of stuff.
But also the gut brain access,

3181
02:22:10,191 --> 02:22:14,030
the bagel nerve where like you can make 
certain things that are like if you,

3182
02:22:14,031 --> 02:22:16,490
if you have certain bacteria in the gut 
that are making,

3183
02:22:16,491 --> 02:22:21,491
for example,
gabba that can stimulate the nerve in 

3184
02:22:21,491 --> 02:22:24,100
inhibitory way that like comes in and 
does something calming to the,

3185
02:22:24,300 --> 02:22:24,790
to the,
to the,

3186
02:22:24,990 --> 02:22:26,160
the brain part.
We don't really

3187
02:22:26,160 --> 02:22:31,160
understand all the mechanisms.
That's just fascinating field that I'm 

3188
02:22:31,160 --> 02:22:32,560
like trying to follow and keep up on,
you know.

3189
02:22:32,580 --> 02:22:33,690
But I mean,
the question is,

3190
02:22:33,691 --> 02:22:37,170
do you do normal healthy people need to 
take probiotics all the time and I don't

3191
02:22:37,171 --> 02:22:39,100
know the answer,
but I do think that we need to,

3192
02:22:39,130 --> 02:22:44,130
to eat the right foods to get our 
microbiome healthy and avoid things 

3193
02:22:44,130 --> 02:22:44,130
like,
you know,

3194
02:22:44,250 --> 02:22:45,330
what's it called?
Aspartame.

3195
02:22:45,540 --> 02:22:47,280
Yeah,
aspartame.

3196
02:22:47,310 --> 02:22:49,860
Nutrasweet.
Although that's the same stuff,

3197
02:22:49,861 --> 02:22:50,840
right?
That's nutrasweet.

3198
02:22:51,480 --> 02:22:54,640
I think it is the blue packet now.

3199
02:22:54,810 --> 02:22:59,810
Well,
getting back to developing fetuses and 

3200
02:22:59,810 --> 02:23:00,660
uh,
an infant developing in the womb.

3201
02:23:00,930 --> 02:23:02,880
When you were talking about,
uh,

3202
02:23:04,380 --> 02:23:09,030
foods that cause inflammation and 
autoimmune diseases,

3203
02:23:09,070 --> 02:23:10,710
there's,
there's a correlation between those two.

3204
02:23:10,740 --> 02:23:14,970
Correct.
So when your eating inflammation causing

3205
02:23:14,971 --> 02:23:16,950
foods,
refined carbohydrates,

3206
02:23:16,951 --> 02:23:21,900
refined sugars,
and you have a baby and if you have this

3207
02:23:21,901 --> 02:23:26,070
inflammation in your body and you are 
having autoimmune reactions,

3208
02:23:26,270 --> 02:23:31,270
uh,
and this can trigger many autoimmune 

3209
02:23:31,270 --> 02:23:31,270
diseases that people have.
Um,

3210
02:23:31,320 --> 02:23:32,310
what's,
is there.

3211
02:23:32,370 --> 02:23:37,370
Has there been studies done trying to 
understand what happens when you consume

3212
02:23:38,221 --> 02:23:43,221
a lot of pro inflammatory foods,
foods that cause inflammation and what 

3213
02:23:43,221 --> 02:23:45,870
kind of a reaction that has to the 
developing child?

3214
02:23:45,870 --> 02:23:47,250
Well,
studies have been done,

3215
02:23:47,360 --> 02:23:48,510
um,
you know,

3216
02:23:48,580 --> 02:23:53,580
to,
to establish causation in animals and 

3217
02:23:53,580 --> 02:23:56,691
looking at correlation and there've been
correlated correlative studies in 

3218
02:23:56,691 --> 02:23:56,691
humans.
So for example,

3219
02:23:56,691 --> 02:23:57,660
most of the time though,
people,

3220
02:23:57,750 --> 02:24:02,750
the correlative studies aren't looking 
at whether or not they're consuming the 

3221
02:24:02,750 --> 02:24:05,571
quote unquote inflammatory foods that 
cause inflammatory types of reactions 

3222
02:24:05,571 --> 02:24:06,180
like refined sugar.
They're just looking at obese mothers.

3223
02:24:06,570 --> 02:24:10,920
And usually someone who's obese 
typically is not eating a healthy diet.

3224
02:24:11,210 --> 02:24:13,320
So I think that more times than not can 
say,

3225
02:24:13,321 --> 02:24:14,940
well,
they're probably eating a lot of refined

3226
02:24:14,941 --> 02:24:17,070
carbohydrates and things like that.
But you know,

3227
02:24:17,530 --> 02:24:18,660
and,
and so that,

3228
02:24:18,680 --> 02:24:20,670
you know,
the correlation between that and looking

3229
02:24:20,671 --> 02:24:20,990
at,
you know,

3230
02:24:21,030 --> 02:24:24,690
negative health consequences and 
offspring like type one diabetes,

3231
02:24:25,320 --> 02:24:30,320
even poor,
doing poorly on cognitive cognition 

3232
02:24:30,320 --> 02:24:30,990
tests and things like that that's been 
looked at.

3233
02:24:31,470 --> 02:24:36,470
Animal studies,
there have been studies that have shown 

3234
02:24:36,470 --> 02:24:37,800
causally that you can do that by feeding
a mouse,

3235
02:24:37,801 --> 02:24:40,020
a high fat high sugar diet and then,
you know,

3236
02:24:40,200 --> 02:24:45,080
making the female mouse obese and 
changing basically the way there,

3237
02:24:45,130 --> 02:24:47,880
the offspring metabolism and their 
immune cells are reacting.

3238
02:24:47,880 --> 02:24:50,970
So things like that definitely have been
shown in animal studies,

3239
02:24:50,971 --> 02:24:55,971
but it's,
it's really almost impossible to show a 

3240
02:24:55,971 --> 02:24:56,280
causal study like that in humans.
Right.

3241
02:24:56,281 --> 02:24:57,630
So it's like you kind of have to,
like,

3242
02:24:57,631 --> 02:25:02,631
you've got these,
like you were showing with the 

3243
02:25:02,631 --> 02:25:05,450
acetaminophen and adhd to reduce risk.
Like you're not going to have a 

3244
02:25:05,450 --> 02:25:09,051
controlled trial where they're going to 
give women acetaminophen during 

3245
02:25:09,051 --> 02:25:11,100
pregnancy and see if it causes adhd.
Like that's never gonna happen.

3246
02:25:11,101 --> 02:25:12,030
Like you can't,
it's not,

3247
02:25:12,060 --> 02:25:12,450
it's,
it's,

3248
02:25:12,770 --> 02:25:14,230
it's unethical.
Right.

3249
02:25:14,550 --> 02:25:19,550
You know.
So then the next best thing would be to 

3250
02:25:19,550 --> 02:25:19,550
like then go to animal studies.
And show it,

3251
02:25:19,550 --> 02:25:19,680
you know,
the problem,

3252
02:25:19,740 --> 02:25:21,670
the problem with the animal studies,
and this is,

3253
02:25:21,750 --> 02:25:25,450
this is always problem is you know,
you never know how much of it translates

3254
02:25:25,840 --> 02:25:27,220
into things.
Things are different,

3255
02:25:27,221 --> 02:25:29,590
like the way they're,
they metabolize the livers of,

3256
02:25:29,740 --> 02:25:34,740
of mice,
metabolize xenobiotics can be a little 

3257
02:25:34,740 --> 02:25:34,740
different than humans.

3258
02:25:34,740 --> 02:25:36,050
And so things like,
you know,

3259
02:25:36,070 --> 02:25:41,070
these,
these mice can be a little more 

3260
02:25:41,070 --> 02:25:41,070
susceptible to things like bpa in,
you know,

3261
02:25:41,070 --> 02:25:42,160
things that are,
that are damaging,

3262
02:25:42,470 --> 02:25:43,360
um,
than,

3263
02:25:43,390 --> 02:25:44,290
than humans,
which,

3264
02:25:44,320 --> 02:25:48,430
which contain certain enzymes that some 
of these mice lack,

3265
02:25:48,431 --> 02:25:49,110
that can,
you know,

3266
02:25:49,330 --> 02:25:52,960
basically alter their metabolism and 
make it not so harmful so to speak.

3267
02:25:53,220 --> 02:25:54,100
Um,
but,

3268
02:25:54,130 --> 02:25:56,960
but still,
I think it's good if you've,

3269
02:25:57,040 --> 02:26:00,880
if you've got like the perspective 
studies in humans that's correlating.

3270
02:26:00,881 --> 02:26:02,920
And then you've got the mechanistic 
studies in animals,

3271
02:26:03,310 --> 02:26:08,310
it's a stronger,
it's a stronger argument than if you 

3272
02:26:08,310 --> 02:26:08,310
just looked at one or the other.
You know,

3273
02:26:08,510 --> 02:26:10,830
good studies that show.
There's a correlation between gut,

3274
02:26:10,940 --> 02:26:15,940
my gut microbiome and children with 
autism and asperger's and several other 

3275
02:26:16,971 --> 02:26:17,470
diseases.

3276
02:26:17,520 --> 02:26:18,090
Yeah,
yeah.

3277
02:26:18,091 --> 02:26:21,180
There have been.
the gut microbiome seems to play a major

3278
02:26:21,181 --> 02:26:22,130
role in,
um,

3279
02:26:22,200 --> 02:26:27,200
there's definitely some changes with 
autistic children and I'm an asperger's 

3280
02:26:28,441 --> 02:26:31,260
like being on the autistic spectrum.
So,

3281
02:26:31,261 --> 02:26:32,820
and,
and that's something that's like,

3282
02:26:32,910 --> 02:26:36,240
I'm not sure it's entirely understood,
but there's a connection there.

3283
02:26:36,241 --> 02:26:41,241
There's a connection with the gut 
microbiome and parkinson's disease with 

3284
02:26:41,241 --> 02:26:43,260
multiple sclerosis.
I mean these are,

3285
02:26:43,290 --> 02:26:48,290
these are lots of studies are coming out
showing these connection with brain 

3286
02:26:48,290 --> 02:26:48,290
problems,
not,

3287
02:26:48,290 --> 02:26:49,110
not just,
you know,

3288
02:26:49,130 --> 02:26:50,790
autoimmune type of,
of,

3289
02:26:50,791 --> 02:26:53,820
of um,
diseases like multiple sclerosis,

3290
02:26:53,821 --> 02:26:57,030
but neurodegenerative diseases and just 
even behavioral diseases.

3291
02:26:57,330 --> 02:26:58,590
So,
you know,

3292
02:26:58,591 --> 02:26:59,690
there's,
it's a whole,

3293
02:26:59,691 --> 02:27:00,320
it's a,
it's a,

3294
02:27:00,420 --> 02:27:05,420
we're kind of just starting to scratch 
the surface of this field with the 

3295
02:27:05,420 --> 02:27:05,700
microbiome and even cancer.
Like there's,

3296
02:27:05,730 --> 02:27:06,510
there's,
you know,

3297
02:27:06,600 --> 02:27:08,390
it's known that the,
the,

3298
02:27:08,490 --> 02:27:10,740
some of the short chain fatty acids that
microbiome,

3299
02:27:10,741 --> 02:27:12,580
certain species make,
um,

3300
02:27:12,840 --> 02:27:16,500
increase the production of something 
called natural natural killer t cells.

3301
02:27:16,890 --> 02:27:21,890
And there's been animal studies where 
you inject them with like human tumors 

3302
02:27:21,890 --> 02:27:25,881
and literally it can you give these 
animals a big dose of probiotics which,

3303
02:27:26,420 --> 02:27:31,420
which help create the species that make 
these short chain fatty acids that make 

3304
02:27:31,420 --> 02:27:35,960
t regulatory cells,
they can kill cancer cells almost as 

3305
02:27:35,960 --> 02:27:36,300
good as the chemo control that they're 
giving these animals.

3306
02:27:36,480 --> 02:27:41,480
And then if you look at,
there's some preliminary human trials 

3307
02:27:41,480 --> 02:27:43,851
like for example,
humans that had colorectal cancer and 

3308
02:27:43,851 --> 02:27:47,541
they're given a high dose of probiotic,
like close to 400 billion probiotic 

3309
02:27:47,541 --> 02:27:50,820
products a day.
It like lowered their cancer recurrence.

3310
02:27:50,910 --> 02:27:53,550
Of course they had their colon removed,
surgically removed,

3311
02:27:53,910 --> 02:27:54,680
but,
you know,

3312
02:27:54,720 --> 02:27:56,370
still it's lowering their cancer 
recurrence.

3313
02:27:56,371 --> 02:28:01,371
And I think that's a interesting along 
with knowing what we know about animal 

3314
02:28:01,371 --> 02:28:02,910
studies and natural killer t cells and 
all that.

3315
02:28:02,911 --> 02:28:04,080
So,
you know,

3316
02:28:04,081 --> 02:28:07,440
it's not just brain,
but it's also a lot of diseases,

3317
02:28:07,680 --> 02:28:09,150
cancer,
you know,

3318
02:28:09,151 --> 02:28:10,830
um,
autoimmune diseases,

3319
02:28:10,890 --> 02:28:12,810
lots of things.
And gut is so important.

3320
02:28:13,050 --> 02:28:13,950
It really is.
It's the,

3321
02:28:13,951 --> 02:28:16,620
it's the major sources of inflammation 
in the body.

3322
02:28:16,920 --> 02:28:21,920
It's the major source.
Like people are so worried about taking 

3323
02:28:21,920 --> 02:28:22,250
this x thing exogenously from

3324
02:28:22,280 --> 02:28:23,510
some chemical and it's like,
yeah,

3325
02:28:23,511 --> 02:28:25,520
you should be worried about that,
but you should be worried about your gut

3326
02:28:25,521 --> 02:28:26,720
health.
Like really,

3327
02:28:26,810 --> 02:28:30,560
and probably one of the loose understood
in terms of like the general public.

3328
02:28:30,680 --> 02:28:31,550
Yeah,
I mean,

3329
02:28:31,551 --> 02:28:35,990
and even scientists like we're just now 
really diving into that and I think that

3330
02:28:36,110 --> 02:28:38,000
I should say at least aware,
right?

3331
02:28:38,150 --> 02:28:38,900
Yeah,
exactly.

3332
02:28:38,930 --> 02:28:41,090
Most people have no idea that it's even 
an issue now.

3333
02:28:41,091 --> 02:28:46,091
When you consider the fact that the rise
in children on the spectrum or 

3334
02:28:46,091 --> 02:28:50,830
corresponds with the rise of refined 
carbohydrates and refined sugars in our 

3335
02:28:50,830 --> 02:28:54,821
diet,
do you think that there's some sort of 

3336
02:28:54,821 --> 02:28:54,821
connection there?
It has a negative effect.

3337
02:28:54,821 --> 02:28:57,980
Refined sugars have a negative effect on
your microbiome is certainly.

3338
02:28:57,981 --> 02:29:02,981
I mean there's,
I think there's lots of contributing 

3339
02:29:02,981 --> 02:29:02,981
factors to autism.
You know,

3340
02:29:02,981 --> 02:29:04,190
I published a paper on this with vitamin
d deficiency being one.

3341
02:29:04,490 --> 02:29:05,840
Um,
I think that diet,

3342
02:29:06,020 --> 02:29:06,830
you know,
diet,

3343
02:29:06,850 --> 02:29:09,650
um,
a lot of other factors play a role.

3344
02:29:09,770 --> 02:29:12,430
Paternal age actually plays a role.
Um,

3345
02:29:12,620 --> 02:29:17,030
smoking is also been shown like a 
maternal smoking apparently,

3346
02:29:17,450 --> 02:29:19,010
particularly for the father,
the father.

3347
02:29:19,280 --> 02:29:20,200
Paternal age.
Yeah.

3348
02:29:20,330 --> 02:29:21,040
Yeah.
So that,

3349
02:29:21,041 --> 02:29:26,041
that seems to,
and that's something that's a couple of 

3350
02:29:26,041 --> 02:29:28,151
studies and publish and I think even 
recently it just kind of a big one came 

3351
02:29:28,151 --> 02:29:29,430
out that was confirming because most 
people think it's maternal right.

3352
02:29:29,450 --> 02:29:33,470
But it's actually both maternal plays a 
role in down syndrome.

3353
02:29:34,100 --> 02:29:35,480
So,
but uh,

3354
02:29:35,481 --> 02:29:38,780
I'm not aware of maternal age being 
linked to autism,

3355
02:29:38,781 --> 02:29:42,530
although I wouldn't be surprised.
Um,

3356
02:29:42,820 --> 02:29:46,130
there's probably an interaction with all
these things in interaction with,

3357
02:29:46,480 --> 02:29:47,660
you know,
the,

3358
02:29:47,690 --> 02:29:50,930
the quality of,
of the dna in a woman's egg or sperm,

3359
02:29:51,330 --> 02:29:56,330
sperm and the type of diet they have and
whether they're taking acetaminophen or 

3360
02:29:57,021 --> 02:29:58,310
whatever,
fill in the blank.

3361
02:29:58,490 --> 02:30:03,490
Pharmaceutical or diet of the father and
the diet of the father you were talking 

3362
02:30:03,490 --> 02:30:04,460
about before with obese people.
Yeah.

3363
02:30:04,461 --> 02:30:06,980
And what's interesting with that now in 
that day,

3364
02:30:06,981 --> 02:30:09,780
I mean that study,
that was totally a pilot experiment,

3365
02:30:09,781 --> 02:30:11,420
just looking at how it altered gene 
expression.

3366
02:30:11,421 --> 02:30:14,240
But if you look in the animal studies,
paternal diet,

3367
02:30:14,241 --> 02:30:19,241
so so males,
male mice that were given a high fat 

3368
02:30:19,241 --> 02:30:19,340
high sugar diet most of the time,
by the way,

3369
02:30:19,341 --> 02:30:22,640
when you see headlines and it says high 
fat diet causes blank,

3370
02:30:23,420 --> 02:30:26,150
high fat diet and animal studies is 
always high fat,

3371
02:30:26,151 --> 02:30:27,710
high sugar,
and they always,

3372
02:30:27,770 --> 02:30:28,390
oh,
it's all,

3373
02:30:28,391 --> 02:30:32,540
it's almost always almost always high 
high sucrose and high high fat.

3374
02:30:32,570 --> 02:30:35,180
But why don't they say that?
I don't,

3375
02:30:35,240 --> 02:30:39,080
I don't know,
because I guess you know,

3376
02:30:39,081 --> 02:30:39,520
they're,
they're,

3377
02:30:39,530 --> 02:30:44,530
they're so,
so drastically changing the fat 

3378
02:30:44,530 --> 02:30:46,901
composition that they just kind of 
always say the high fat and the 

3379
02:30:46,901 --> 02:30:50,651
interaction between these two things 
just really is now starting to be 

3380
02:30:50,651 --> 02:30:50,651
understood.

3381
02:30:50,651 --> 02:30:51,170
But it,
it,

3382
02:30:51,240 --> 02:30:53,360
it really is a high fat is almost 
always.

3383
02:30:53,570 --> 02:30:58,570
So I always call it high inflammatory 
diet because it's a combination of the 

3384
02:30:58,570 --> 02:30:58,570
two.
But anyways,

3385
02:30:58,570 --> 02:31:01,550
they feel that if you feed male mice,
this diet of high fat and high sucrose,

3386
02:31:01,970 --> 02:31:04,910
they become obese and then they have 
offspring.

3387
02:31:05,120 --> 02:31:08,480
If you feed the feed their offspring,
normal diet.

3388
02:31:08,750 --> 02:31:10,310
So not,
not the high fat.

3389
02:31:10,311 --> 02:31:12,350
So they're just fed a normal child.
I had those offspring,

3390
02:31:12,440 --> 02:31:16,220
female offspring don't become obese,
but they get type one diabetes.

3391
02:31:17,690 --> 02:31:19,830
So it's because,
and then what and what was found is that

3392
02:31:19,831 --> 02:31:19,970
the,

3393
02:31:20,040 --> 02:31:25,040
the um,
the obesity was changing genes that 

3394
02:31:25,040 --> 02:31:25,910
regulate pancreatic beta cell,
uh,

3395
02:31:26,020 --> 02:31:29,930
insulin production in their sperm dna 
and that was passed on to the,

3396
02:31:29,970 --> 02:31:34,970
to the offspring.
So that's kind of again looking at.

3397
02:31:35,280 --> 02:31:38,430
It's also comp works.
I know it is,

3398
02:31:38,460 --> 02:31:39,990
it's complex.
It's interesting.

3399
02:31:39,991 --> 02:31:44,991
I'm,
I certainly am constantly trying to 

3400
02:31:44,991 --> 02:31:44,991
optimize,
you know,

3401
02:31:44,991 --> 02:31:45,380
everything I can to,
you know,

3402
02:31:45,540 --> 02:31:48,660
the best of my ability and things are 
always changing,

3403
02:31:48,860 --> 02:31:50,340
you know,
that's the thing with science and that's

3404
02:31:50,341 --> 02:31:52,140
also the thing with,
you know,

3405
02:31:52,770 --> 02:31:56,490
following,
following someone or following a certain

3406
02:31:56,700 --> 02:31:57,630
dogma,
you know,

3407
02:31:57,631 --> 02:32:01,060
things change and you have to be able to
like accept that things change.

3408
02:32:01,061 --> 02:32:06,061
The more data we have,
the more tools that we have at our 

3409
02:32:06,061 --> 02:32:06,061
disposal to add our,
you know,

3410
02:32:06,061 --> 02:32:10,530
to investigate things are paradigm 
shifts like saturated fat.

3411
02:32:10,770 --> 02:32:12,930
I mean that's a huge paradigm shift.
You know,

3412
02:32:12,931 --> 02:32:15,450
people in my parents' generation like my
dad,

3413
02:32:15,860 --> 02:32:17,760
and you just convinced that like you 
say,

3414
02:32:17,850 --> 02:32:20,260
saturated fat is going to kill you,
you know,

3415
02:32:20,580 --> 02:32:22,630
it's parented by people everyday.

3416
02:32:22,800 --> 02:32:25,350
And you know,
we've talked about this before.

3417
02:32:25,351 --> 02:32:26,430
I believe on the poc,
josh,

3418
02:32:26,520 --> 02:32:31,520
you and I about that study.
The studies were either with the 

3419
02:32:31,520 --> 02:32:31,620
scientists were paid off by the sugar 
industry.

3420
02:32:32,610 --> 02:32:37,610
Right?
And that's the sugar industry is 

3421
02:32:37,610 --> 02:32:38,580
probably one of the worst examples.
Like it's not always the case,

3422
02:32:38,581 --> 02:32:43,581
you know,
like if you have someone funding your 

3423
02:32:43,581 --> 02:32:44,670
research that is involved in whatever 
you're investigating,

3424
02:32:45,120 --> 02:32:47,640
the sugar industry is particularly bad,
but it's not always the case.

3425
02:32:47,641 --> 02:32:50,020
Like I wAs involved in research,
um,

3426
02:32:50,070 --> 02:32:55,070
with blueberries and the research was 
funded by the high bush blueberry 

3427
02:32:55,070 --> 02:32:59,301
council.
And so we did this placebo controlled 

3428
02:32:59,301 --> 02:32:59,301
trial where we are looking at,
you know,

3429
02:32:59,301 --> 02:33:00,660
there's a whole panel of scientists 
involved.

3430
02:33:00,661 --> 02:33:02,280
And I was just one of the scientists 
involved in.

3431
02:33:02,281 --> 02:33:06,300
I was looking specifically at dna damage
and um,

3432
02:33:06,330 --> 02:33:11,330
you know,
how blueberries modulator that dna 

3433
02:33:11,330 --> 02:33:11,860
damage which can lead to aging and 
cancer and stem cell dysfunction,

3434
02:33:11,890 --> 02:33:12,570
all sorts of things.

3435
02:33:13,140 --> 02:33:16,170
And there was a placebo group,
so it was an enormous amount of work,

3436
02:33:16,171 --> 02:33:21,171
you know,
we had to isolate blood from patients 

3437
02:33:21,171 --> 02:33:21,171
that they were given this blueberry 
powder,

3438
02:33:21,171 --> 02:33:23,610
they were taking twice a day for eight 
weeks or placebo powder.

3439
02:33:23,611 --> 02:33:24,390
And then we had to,
you know,

3440
02:33:24,391 --> 02:33:28,030
look at their dna damage.
And um,

3441
02:33:28,080 --> 02:33:31,590
what my work found was that,
to my surprise,

3442
02:33:31,591 --> 02:33:36,591
so blueberries lower dna damage,
which is what I thought because they 

3443
02:33:36,591 --> 02:33:38,670
have a variety of compounds in them that
are known to be antioxidants.

3444
02:33:39,270 --> 02:33:41,610
But what was really surprising to me was
that it,

3445
02:33:41,790 --> 02:33:46,790
uh,
the placebo actually lower dna damage 

3446
02:33:46,790 --> 02:33:46,790
just as well,
if not better,

3447
02:33:46,790 --> 02:33:51,440
then the blueberry powder and the 
placebo powder had a little bit of 

3448
02:33:51,440 --> 02:33:52,680
refined sugar in it.
And some.

3449
02:33:52,710 --> 02:33:55,020
I'm like coloring food coloring and 
stuff.

3450
02:33:55,021 --> 02:33:56,760
And so I was like,
oh my god,

3451
02:33:56,790 --> 02:34:00,360
what's going on here?
How is the sugar lowering dna damage?

3452
02:34:00,361 --> 02:34:05,361
Well,
it turns out I had looked at gene 

3453
02:34:05,361 --> 02:34:05,361
expression data as well.
All these genes,

3454
02:34:05,361 --> 02:34:05,361
um,
that are,

3455
02:34:05,361 --> 02:34:08,340
that are involved in stress response.
And in hormesis,

3456
02:34:08,940 --> 02:34:13,940
the reason I was looking at that is 
because there are certain compounds in 

3457
02:34:13,940 --> 02:34:14,670
the blueberries that can have a hormetic
response and I wanted to see if that was

3458
02:34:14,671 --> 02:34:16,650
being activated.
Well,

3459
02:34:16,890 --> 02:34:17,710
it wasn't really

3460
02:34:18,190 --> 02:34:19,840
robustly being activated in the 
blueberries,

3461
02:34:19,841 --> 02:34:22,210
but in placebo,
some of these pathways,

3462
02:34:22,211 --> 02:34:27,211
the same pathways that like sulforaphane
can activate really well to some degree 

3463
02:34:27,211 --> 02:34:28,360
was being activated because we think it 
was slightly stressful.

3464
02:34:28,720 --> 02:34:30,440
Of course it was a very small amount of 
sugar and,

3465
02:34:30,500 --> 02:34:35,500
and also the uh,
the dyes that were used or have been 

3466
02:34:35,500 --> 02:34:35,590
shown to cause a little bit of a 
hermetic response.

3467
02:34:35,950 --> 02:34:37,220
But you know,
we're going to publish that day.

3468
02:34:37,221 --> 02:34:41,740
It's not like because the blueberry 
foundation funded this study,

3469
02:34:41,780 --> 02:34:43,060
you know,
you know,

3470
02:34:43,061 --> 02:34:46,150
it's,
the data is still this data is the data.

3471
02:34:46,630 --> 02:34:50,380
We didn't change anything.
So it's not always the case.

3472
02:34:50,381 --> 02:34:55,381
And again,
there's something very interesting here 

3473
02:34:55,381 --> 02:34:57,691
and like you said,
science always surprises you and always 

3474
02:34:57,691 --> 02:34:59,560
the things that you like.
It's something to predict.

3475
02:34:59,980 --> 02:35:04,980
So completely the opposite.
and there's something always 

3476
02:35:04,980 --> 02:35:04,980
interesting.
They're always,

3477
02:35:04,980 --> 02:35:05,200
you know,
like as humans,

3478
02:35:05,201 --> 02:35:07,000
we think we know biology and we're like,
oh,

3479
02:35:07,060 --> 02:35:12,060
this is going to be predicted to be that
and all of a sudden it's complete 

3480
02:35:12,060 --> 02:35:12,060
opposite and you're like,
what's going on?

3481
02:35:12,060 --> 02:35:15,130
The time you come on the podcast though,
I'm reminded of the fact there's so much

3482
02:35:15,131 --> 02:35:20,131
data.
It is impossible to keep it all in your 

3483
02:35:20,131 --> 02:35:23,071
head and especially for one person.
We do dealing with all these different 

3484
02:35:23,071 --> 02:35:23,590
fields,
all these different,

3485
02:35:24,040 --> 02:35:29,040
different scientists working on all 
these different studies and it's almost 

3486
02:35:29,040 --> 02:35:31,480
impossible for one person to have all 
this data in their head.

3487
02:35:31,870 --> 02:35:32,770
yeah,
it is,

3488
02:35:33,910 --> 02:35:36,910
but it's interesting to me.
It's fascinating.

3489
02:35:36,911 --> 02:35:41,911
It's unbelievably fascinating,
but it's one of the reasons why boiling 

3490
02:35:41,911 --> 02:35:46,111
something down to a clickbait title of 
an article is so it's so enticing 

3491
02:35:46,111 --> 02:35:46,690
because it's like,
oh,

3492
02:35:46,691 --> 02:35:49,420
tell me high fat diet kills the mites.
Fuck that.

3493
02:35:49,500 --> 02:35:50,590
All right,
I'm on dumb dumb.

3494
02:35:50,591 --> 02:35:53,380
Going back to low fat vitamins give you 
cancer vitamins,

3495
02:35:53,381 --> 02:35:55,270
give you a cancer.
That's going to make a headline.

3496
02:35:55,271 --> 02:35:56,120
Yeah.
Yeah.

3497
02:35:56,200 --> 02:36:01,200
When you thInk some hilarious,
you have to dig into them and you're 

3498
02:36:01,200 --> 02:36:01,200
like,
wait a minute.

3499
02:36:01,200 --> 02:36:04,690
The sugar industry study was from the 
1950 [inaudible] and 19 sixties probably

3500
02:36:04,691 --> 02:36:08,590
pretty difficult to have something that 
biased and fraudulent today.

3501
02:36:08,740 --> 02:36:11,650
There was even another one that just 
came out recently,

3502
02:36:11,670 --> 02:36:14,440
like we talked about one last year,
but there was another one that came out,

3503
02:36:14,750 --> 02:36:17,320
another study,
I think it was published in like plcs or

3504
02:36:17,380 --> 02:36:20,440
plus one of those two showing that they,
they,

3505
02:36:20,441 --> 02:36:21,940
um,
suppress data that,

3506
02:36:22,080 --> 02:36:26,320
that refined sugar played a role in 
cancer and in heart disease.

3507
02:36:26,770 --> 02:36:27,600
So,
so,

3508
02:36:27,820 --> 02:36:30,180
and this was the seventies I believe.
Um,

3509
02:36:30,190 --> 02:36:34,180
so there's more,
more than one study that have now linked

3510
02:36:34,181 --> 02:36:39,160
them to basically a holding back data 
being published.

3511
02:36:39,220 --> 02:36:40,390
Um,
you know,

3512
02:36:40,450 --> 02:36:42,550
so they're,
they're one that's definitely,

3513
02:36:42,570 --> 02:36:47,570
I would say pretty bad.
I had someone send me some review 

3514
02:36:47,570 --> 02:36:50,311
articles that were basically stating 
that refined sugar was not bad and the 

3515
02:36:50,311 --> 02:36:53,620
review articles were,
we're funded by the sugar foundation and

3516
02:36:53,621 --> 02:36:54,250
I was like,
oh,

3517
02:36:54,251 --> 02:36:55,030
this is the one.

3518
02:36:55,060 --> 02:36:57,890
I usually don't say this.
Like I usually don't say like,

3519
02:36:58,120 --> 02:37:00,200
you know,
based on who funds a study like this,

3520
02:37:00,460 --> 02:37:04,330
the conflicts of interest disclosures.
But this is one time where it's like,

3521
02:37:05,230 --> 02:37:06,220
you know,
the sugar foundation,

3522
02:37:06,221 --> 02:37:11,221
they're just notoriously bad and it's 
also contrary to everything else has 

3523
02:37:11,221 --> 02:37:11,560
been established right.
Yet when you understand,

3524
02:37:11,561 --> 02:37:13,500
it's like when you look at,
like I say all those things,

3525
02:37:13,501 --> 02:37:18,501
the mechanism and you look at the 
interaction between foods and how the 

3526
02:37:18,501 --> 02:37:22,481
body is processing these things.
and you look at the observational data 

3527
02:37:22,481 --> 02:37:23,180
and controlled trials.
I mean,

3528
02:37:23,570 --> 02:37:26,450
you know,
how many things can you say,

3529
02:37:26,510 --> 02:37:28,250
you know no to.
I mean you just,

3530
02:37:28,251 --> 02:37:31,300
you know,
just looking at one thing there,

3531
02:37:31,340 --> 02:37:32,660
you know,
that's not as strong.

3532
02:37:33,080 --> 02:37:36,140
But you know,
looking at all of it is the big picture.

3533
02:37:36,450 --> 02:37:40,100
There's just so much money in sugar.
So many things have sugar in them.

3534
02:37:40,430 --> 02:37:40,840
I mean,
what,

3535
02:37:40,841 --> 02:37:45,841
what we've allowed to have done in this 
country is literally allowed this one 

3536
02:37:46,520 --> 02:37:49,010
thing,
this one substance to be in.

3537
02:37:49,050 --> 02:37:50,900
I mean,
what percentage of our food do you think

3538
02:37:50,901 --> 02:37:52,810
has sugar in it?
If you had,

3539
02:37:53,440 --> 02:37:58,440
if you go to a restaurant or you go to 
get some condiments or food.

3540
02:37:59,390 --> 02:38:00,290
Yeah,
I mean those things.

3541
02:38:00,300 --> 02:38:00,850
There's,
there's,

3542
02:38:00,860 --> 02:38:03,490
it's slipped in everywhere.
Like thai food or you know,

3543
02:38:03,491 --> 02:38:05,420
it's like you go and say,
oh this tastes sweet,

3544
02:38:05,510 --> 02:38:08,690
like sugar.
It's got sugar in it,

3545
02:38:08,750 --> 02:38:10,400
you know,
so it certainly.

3546
02:38:10,790 --> 02:38:13,660
But that's almost acceptable.
So like I get what you're doing,

3547
02:38:13,940 --> 02:38:16,940
make something taste delicious because 
you're an artist,

3548
02:38:17,160 --> 02:38:22,160
you're,
you're cooking a meal and the meal is 

3549
02:38:22,160 --> 02:38:22,160
not just nutritious.
It's all supposed to.

3550
02:38:22,160 --> 02:38:26,221
Supposed to be a delight to the census 
data kind of get,

3551
02:38:27,260 --> 02:38:32,260
you know.
But what I don't get is that it's 

3552
02:38:32,260 --> 02:38:35,600
permeated our entire diet.
The average american diet.

3553
02:38:35,630 --> 02:38:37,220
it's at,
it's in everything.

3554
02:38:37,221 --> 02:38:40,310
It's in the drinks we drink,
it's in the foods we eat,

3555
02:38:40,640 --> 02:38:42,860
the bread that you consume,
it's in the pasta,

3556
02:38:42,861 --> 02:38:45,520
it's spaghetti sauce.
It's in me.

3557
02:38:46,100 --> 02:38:51,100
It's in everything.
If you go down the aisle at a 

3558
02:38:51,100 --> 02:38:53,240
supermarket and just grab a random cam 
thing,

3559
02:38:53,270 --> 02:38:54,890
grab it,
turn it,

3560
02:38:55,130 --> 02:38:59,360
you're going to recheck her.
You're gonna see it much more often than

3561
02:38:59,361 --> 02:39:00,500
you're not going to see it.
Right.

3562
02:39:00,770 --> 02:39:01,490
Stunning.

3563
02:39:01,590 --> 02:39:03,960
Yeah.
And now that happened to me not long ago

3564
02:39:03,961 --> 02:39:06,480
when like sent dan to the store to get 
some,

3565
02:39:06,481 --> 02:39:09,120
like some kind of like I was wanting 
some wishes.

3566
02:39:09,121 --> 02:39:14,121
Her sauce,
like for my steak for some reason I was 

3567
02:39:14,121 --> 02:39:14,121
like having a stylistic thing.
I was like,

3568
02:39:14,121 --> 02:39:17,070
wait a minute.
Oh I can't eat the sugar in it.

3569
02:39:17,690 --> 02:39:19,020
Yeah.
What's your sheer sauce?

3570
02:39:19,021 --> 02:39:20,670
Tastes like shit.
Why does it have sugar?

3571
02:39:21,300 --> 02:39:23,880
Because it take more,
tastes more like shit if it didn't,

3572
02:39:23,940 --> 02:39:25,530
it it for whatever,
you know.

3573
02:39:25,531 --> 02:39:30,531
It's something that I ate as like a girl
and I had this craving for it and 

3574
02:39:30,531 --> 02:39:32,040
received another kid to maybe it was 
like more common.

3575
02:39:32,041 --> 02:39:34,160
We were young.
I think so because it's really easy.

3576
02:39:34,210 --> 02:39:35,970
It's not as common anymore.
No.

3577
02:39:35,971 --> 02:39:37,800
You never even hear about it.
Like,

3578
02:39:37,801 --> 02:39:41,010
my kids don't even know what my kid 
loves cholula.

3579
02:39:41,320 --> 02:39:42,360
It's probably got sugar in it.

3580
02:39:43,380 --> 02:39:45,630
I don't know if that one does.
Actually I think about that might be one

3581
02:39:45,631 --> 02:39:49,200
of the better ones is my seven year old 
fucking love cholula.

3582
02:39:49,201 --> 02:39:51,360
She puts it in everything.
She put it in milk.

3583
02:39:51,850 --> 02:39:54,360
We to tell her,
stop doing that is so gross.

3584
02:39:55,950 --> 02:39:58,500
She thinks it's hilarious.
She'll squared it right at our tongue,

3585
02:39:58,640 --> 02:40:00,780
so let's shake it right or wrong.
She loves it.

3586
02:40:00,810 --> 02:40:02,400
Doesn't no sugar.
Beautiful.

3587
02:40:02,460 --> 02:40:03,290
Great.
Yeah.

3588
02:40:03,330 --> 02:40:06,030
That's got something.
I'll probably get some weird red dye.

3589
02:40:06,060 --> 02:40:08,010
It's probably not even really read.
Probably brown.

3590
02:40:08,370 --> 02:40:10,920
I think if people are going to eat sugar
though,

3591
02:40:11,220 --> 02:40:14,130
the one thing they should do is eat it 
within a time window.

3592
02:40:14,460 --> 02:40:15,570
What's in there?
Nothing.

3593
02:40:15,780 --> 02:40:16,840
Sodium,
gold,

3594
02:40:16,920 --> 02:40:17,910
water,
peppers,

3595
02:40:17,940 --> 02:40:21,180
salt,
vinegar and xantham gum.

3596
02:40:21,240 --> 02:40:22,350
Oh yeah.
Xantham gum.

3597
02:40:22,800 --> 02:40:24,540
Spices.
Susan seem that bad,

3598
02:40:25,560 --> 02:40:30,560
but xantham gum.
But some of the other emulsifiers have 

3599
02:40:30,560 --> 02:40:35,050
been shown to also disrupt the 
microbiome of course by.

3600
02:40:35,410 --> 02:40:36,720
Okay.
That stuff,

3601
02:40:36,721 --> 02:40:38,820
those Little yogurt things the kids 
drink.

3602
02:40:39,080 --> 02:40:40,650
You know what I'm saying?
I don't know,

3603
02:40:40,680 --> 02:40:45,680
but it sounds familiar.
Like yogurty thing that the kids would 

3604
02:40:45,680 --> 02:40:46,170
drink sugar probably.
I'm sure it does.

3605
02:40:46,190 --> 02:40:47,790
It taste sweet wood.
It's got.

3606
02:40:48,200 --> 02:40:52,530
It's supposedly got some sort of 
probiotic in it for kids.

3607
02:40:52,600 --> 02:40:55,030
Do you.
Do you like limit?

3608
02:40:55,031 --> 02:40:59,020
The other is bio kids.
We they take regular bio.

3609
02:40:59,021 --> 02:41:04,021
Okay.
They take that stuff 100 percent 

3610
02:41:04,021 --> 02:41:04,021
probiotic,
zero percent yogurt.

3611
02:41:04,021 --> 02:41:05,790
Okay,
so it doesn't have any lactose.

3612
02:41:06,620 --> 02:41:11,620
I'm bullock what's in there.
Does it have a ingredients thing more.

3613
02:41:12,930 --> 02:41:17,910
Where's the sugar bitch?
Like ingredients.

3614
02:41:17,920 --> 02:41:18,720
Like on every page.

3615
02:41:18,960 --> 02:41:20,550
A hundred percent probiotic.
Come on.

3616
02:41:20,580 --> 02:41:22,170
What's in there?
What's in there?

3617
02:41:22,171 --> 02:41:27,171
You fuckers doesn't say.
Does it say ingredients?

3618
02:41:28,880 --> 02:41:31,650
They're hiding in front of you.
It's sweet,

3619
02:41:31,651 --> 02:41:33,390
man.
I'm telling you.

3620
02:41:33,391 --> 02:41:38,391
It's.
I have a hard time believing there's no 

3621
02:41:38,391 --> 02:41:38,391
sugar in there.
well,

3622
02:41:38,391 --> 02:41:39,810
the other thing with those probiotic 
supplemented things,

3623
02:41:39,811 --> 02:41:42,690
is that like the amount of probiotics in
them or like minimal,

3624
02:41:43,020 --> 02:41:43,820
right?
yeah.

3625
02:41:44,310 --> 02:41:46,970
I mean my kid likes kimchi.
Really?

3626
02:41:47,090 --> 02:41:50,310
Yeah.
She's a freak sugar,

3627
02:41:50,460 --> 02:41:53,220
nine grams grams and those little 
things.

3628
02:41:53,640 --> 02:41:54,400
You know,
my,

3629
02:41:55,350 --> 02:41:58,110
both my youngest kids are a combination 
of me.

3630
02:41:58,360 --> 02:42:00,380
It's very weird.
You know,

3631
02:42:00,630 --> 02:42:03,750
there's traits like the seven year old 
is way funnier.

3632
02:42:03,780 --> 02:42:06,930
She's hilarious.
She's purposely funny.

3633
02:42:07,220 --> 02:42:10,170
That's so cool.
But the nine year old is just psychotic.

3634
02:42:10,280 --> 02:42:11,580
She's like,
she'll,

3635
02:42:11,581 --> 02:42:16,581
she'll do things like we went to a 
resort once on vacation and she does 

3636
02:42:16,581 --> 02:42:19,380
cheerleading and gymnastics.
She's really into gymnastics.

3637
02:42:20,220 --> 02:42:22,530
She did cartwheels,
a half a mile home.

3638
02:42:22,890 --> 02:42:26,340
We had a walk like a half a mile.
She did cartwheels the entire way back.

3639
02:42:26,790 --> 02:42:28,230
That's crazy.
Psycho.

3640
02:42:28,560 --> 02:42:29,910
Yeah.
She's straight up psycho.

3641
02:42:29,950 --> 02:42:31,140
Like she's really driven.
oh,

3642
02:42:31,141 --> 02:42:33,270
she's crazy.
She's got a six pack.

3643
02:42:33,271 --> 02:42:35,220
She's really driven.
Yeah,

3644
02:42:35,221 --> 02:42:38,000
it's sad seeing the nine year old.
How much you fucked kid.

3645
02:42:39,360 --> 02:42:40,440
I'll show you.
I'll show you later.

3646
02:42:40,460 --> 02:42:41,090
Oh wow.
Yeah,

3647
02:42:41,100 --> 02:42:42,700
it's disturbing.
Yeah.

3648
02:42:43,070 --> 02:42:44,280
Like,
I mean like ripped.

3649
02:42:44,390 --> 02:42:45,990
I would get dizzy sheets.
Everything.

3650
02:42:46,020 --> 02:42:47,590
It's not like she's like a,
you know,

3651
02:42:47,591 --> 02:42:50,190
like anorexic or anything.
She just exercises constantly.

3652
02:42:50,290 --> 02:42:52,940
Early life exercise is important to 
know.

3653
02:42:53,180 --> 02:42:54,780
Yeah.
They do mma,

3654
02:42:54,781 --> 02:42:57,400
they do karate.
Both of them do.

3655
02:42:57,820 --> 02:43:00,680
There are two martial arts.
I've got one of them into jujitsu.

3656
02:43:01,190 --> 02:43:06,190
Did you expose them to like different,
like different things to see what they 

3657
02:43:06,190 --> 02:43:06,190
like.
Yeah.

3658
02:43:06,190 --> 02:43:10,250
Yeah.
I mean it seems like gymnastics is her 

3659
02:43:10,250 --> 02:43:10,250
big one.
Kids,

3660
02:43:10,250 --> 02:43:12,160
little girls love other things where 
other little girls are also

3661
02:43:12,160 --> 02:43:13,310
being active,
you know,

3662
02:43:13,330 --> 02:43:15,250
so gymnastics is a good one because you 
know,

3663
02:43:15,251 --> 02:43:17,860
they're all doing their tumbling and 
there I did that one.

3664
02:43:18,720 --> 02:43:20,890
I think it'S really good for body 
control too,

3665
02:43:20,891 --> 02:43:25,891
and I and I,
and I was talking to her like she likes 

3666
02:43:25,891 --> 02:43:27,010
jujitsu and she likes gymnastics too and
I said,

3667
02:43:27,011 --> 02:43:32,011
well they really help each other because
your jujitsu will benefit greatly from 

3668
02:43:32,011 --> 02:43:35,260
your body control that you get from like
the ability to move your body,

3669
02:43:35,261 --> 02:43:39,410
like do backflips and stands and it's 
just also just the,

3670
02:43:39,430 --> 02:43:43,810
the balance and the ability,
just the dexterity that you get.

3671
02:43:44,180 --> 02:43:45,440
I totally agree.
I,

3672
02:43:45,560 --> 02:43:47,900
I started ice skating when I was really 
young too,

3673
02:43:47,901 --> 02:43:52,901
and a half.
My mom started when I was two and a 

3674
02:43:52,901 --> 02:43:52,901
half.
Yeah.

3675
02:43:52,901 --> 02:43:56,020
So I started asking.
I was two and a half and that also is 

3676
02:43:56,020 --> 02:43:58,391
like a lot of balance and more very 
similar to like ballet too or just 

3677
02:43:58,640 --> 02:44:00,500
graceful sort of things.
And um,

3678
02:44:00,950 --> 02:44:05,950
it really I think helped me with a 
variety of other sports I did later 

3679
02:44:05,950 --> 02:44:06,950
surfing.
Surfing was,

3680
02:44:07,000 --> 02:44:10,730
you know,
a lot more graceful dance like you still

3681
02:44:10,731 --> 02:44:12,480
serve.
I didn't,

3682
02:44:12,610 --> 02:44:15,560
haven't served since prepregnancy yeah,
I would worry about sharks.

3683
02:44:16,040 --> 02:44:21,040
You're a mommy now.
I haven't eaten getting more concerned 

3684
02:44:21,040 --> 02:44:21,380
about sharks.
I forgot what those things.

3685
02:44:21,410 --> 02:44:23,120
The last thing.
There is something.

3686
02:44:23,121 --> 02:44:24,110
I am.
yeah.

3687
02:44:24,111 --> 02:44:25,870
I'm getting a lot more worried about the
show.

3688
02:44:26,110 --> 02:44:28,270
Did you see that video of the guy who 
was swimming?

3689
02:44:28,271 --> 02:44:33,271
He was underwater scuba diving and the 
shark came from behind him and bumped 

3690
02:44:33,271 --> 02:44:33,271
him in the head.

3691
02:44:33,510 --> 02:44:35,520
But you showed me the start for one on 
that freaked me out.

3692
02:44:35,730 --> 02:44:37,860
Or the woman goes surfing.
The shop is right next to them.

3693
02:44:38,490 --> 02:44:43,490
There's so big and all it takes us.
I mean they're eating machines that 

3694
02:44:43,490 --> 02:44:43,490
takes us.

3695
02:44:43,490 --> 02:44:45,110
Look at this sky is underwater.
Check this out.

3696
02:44:45,200 --> 02:44:47,210
Boom.
Put that again because it didn't.

3697
02:44:47,570 --> 02:44:49,340
Is that a great white?
That thing's is huge.

3698
02:44:49,341 --> 02:44:49,900
It is.
look.

3699
02:44:50,630 --> 02:44:51,560
Oh,
oh.

3700
02:44:51,590 --> 02:44:54,020
He opens his mouth.
It hit him in the head.

3701
02:44:54,680 --> 02:44:59,680
I mean that thing easily could have.
Where is this somewhere you shouldn't 

3702
02:44:59,680 --> 02:44:59,680
go.

3703
02:45:00,510 --> 02:45:02,400
That's the carry.
Fuck that.

3704
02:45:02,401 --> 02:45:04,050
So do you do like snorkeling or 
anything?

3705
02:45:04,660 --> 02:45:07,170
I didn't like it.
I was terrified.

3706
02:45:07,660 --> 02:45:08,140
This one

3707
02:45:08,140 --> 02:45:13,140
cool thing where we were on the Big 
island last year and they take you out 

3708
02:45:13,630 --> 02:45:18,630
to where the dolphIns are.
They're like fine schools of dolphins 

3709
02:45:18,630 --> 02:45:18,640
and they.
When the dolphins are in the area,

3710
02:45:18,700 --> 02:45:21,100
they'll take you out on the boat.
They find out where the dolphins are,

3711
02:45:21,101 --> 02:45:26,101
they spot them,
and then you jump in the water and you 

3712
02:45:26,101 --> 02:45:26,101
snorkel with the dolphins.
Yeah.

3713
02:45:26,101 --> 02:45:27,850
It was amazing today.
Were they friendly?

3714
02:45:27,860 --> 02:45:29,980
Did they come up to you?
Don't give a fuck about you.

3715
02:45:30,310 --> 02:45:32,680
That's there.
Dolphins are really smart.

3716
02:45:32,860 --> 02:45:33,580
Yeah.
well they're.

3717
02:45:33,581 --> 02:45:35,830
They're wild dolphins.
They're not like,

3718
02:45:37,000 --> 02:45:39,220
why do I care about you man?
I don't even know what you're saying.

3719
02:45:39,250 --> 02:45:40,310
I don't know what you're doing.
Why?

3720
02:45:40,410 --> 02:45:45,410
Why are you wearing a watch like this?
Didn't want to have anything to do with 

3721
02:45:45,410 --> 02:45:45,880
you.
Why are you monitoring your heart rate?

3722
02:45:46,210 --> 02:45:47,800
Just avoid you,
but it's just.

3723
02:45:48,040 --> 02:45:51,640
It's a crazy feeling just to be in 
literally the middle of the ocean,

3724
02:45:51,641 --> 02:45:54,430
miles from the water or miles from the 
shore rather,

3725
02:45:54,640 --> 02:45:57,850
and you're just looking down and you see
the vastness of it all.

3726
02:45:58,060 --> 02:46:03,060
I think it's in a lot of ways,
there's a reason why beach communities 

3727
02:46:03,060 --> 02:46:05,800
are kind of cool.
They're like peaceful.

3728
02:46:05,920 --> 02:46:10,920
They're very mellow.
I think part of it is because you're 

3729
02:46:10,920 --> 02:46:12,710
humbled by this gigantic body of water.
That's in your face every day.

3730
02:46:12,920 --> 02:46:16,940
I think it's.
It's akin to staring up at the stars.

3731
02:46:17,210 --> 02:46:22,210
There's just something,
something about the vastness of the 

3732
02:46:22,210 --> 02:46:22,210
ocean.
It's so undeniable.

3733
02:46:22,210 --> 02:46:22,850
Your,
your,

3734
02:46:22,880 --> 02:46:27,170
your insignificance in the greater 
scheme of things is so undeniable that I

3735
02:46:27,171 --> 02:46:32,171
think it chills people out.
Whereas I think cities make people like 

3736
02:46:32,171 --> 02:46:34,360
more like to fucking get over their cars
are in my way,

3737
02:46:34,370 --> 02:46:35,300
get out of my way.
Bitch.

3738
02:46:35,540 --> 02:46:40,540
It's like your,
your too much of an important factor in 

3739
02:46:41,121 --> 02:46:42,320
your immediate world.

3740
02:46:42,410 --> 02:46:45,620
I think that's why I was really drawn to
surfing in the first place.

3741
02:46:45,621 --> 02:46:49,880
It's because I'm a really.
Gogo gogo kind of go get her constantly,

3742
02:46:49,881 --> 02:46:50,540
constantly.
Next.

3743
02:46:50,541 --> 02:46:54,200
What's next?
One thing and being out in the water was

3744
02:46:54,201 --> 02:46:59,201
the one place that I would put all that 
behind and I would chill,

3745
02:46:59,480 --> 02:47:04,480
you know,
and I felt really good just sitting on 

3746
02:47:04,480 --> 02:47:06,941
my board and having the water.
Of course I wasn't thinking about the 

3747
02:47:06,941 --> 02:47:08,300
sharks,
but just having the water on me and just

3748
02:47:08,301 --> 02:47:10,510
sitting out there and watching the waves
and you know,

3749
02:47:10,520 --> 02:47:11,540
it's,
it's certainly,

3750
02:47:11,570 --> 02:47:16,570
um,
there is definitely a very chilling 

3751
02:47:16,570 --> 02:47:16,570
factor to it.
And for sure,

3752
02:47:16,570 --> 02:47:17,840
humbling,
oh my goodness.

3753
02:47:17,841 --> 02:47:22,841
Like I still am like terrified,
like on a big day going out because the 

3754
02:47:22,841 --> 02:47:23,630
oceans is really scary.
Like,

3755
02:47:23,631 --> 02:47:26,060
aside from the sharks,
like waves are freaking scary.

3756
02:47:26,061 --> 02:47:28,790
Just the power of them around.
Oh yeah,

3757
02:47:28,791 --> 02:47:31,070
I've had um,
I mean I've had some scary.

3758
02:47:31,640 --> 02:47:34,370
It's kind of amazing.
I get back in after that but,

3759
02:47:34,810 --> 02:47:38,450
but um,
where it's so powerful,

3760
02:47:38,600 --> 02:47:39,590
I mean,
you know,

3761
02:47:39,650 --> 02:47:41,240
where it's just slamming you down,
you're doing

3762
02:47:41,340 --> 02:47:43,290
donuts and you're like,
what's going on?

3763
02:47:43,310 --> 02:47:46,350
You know,
I can't even imagine.

3764
02:47:46,370 --> 02:47:47,930
And um,
some of those crazy people that get,

3765
02:47:48,710 --> 02:47:51,800
they get dragged out on a boat all the 
way out

3766
02:47:51,890 --> 02:47:53,840
to your max towing.
Yeah.

3767
02:47:53,841 --> 02:47:58,841
They get towed in and then they just 
jump on those waves that are 100 feet 

3768
02:47:58,841 --> 02:47:58,841
high.

3769
02:47:58,841 --> 02:48:03,240
Like my,
I get sweaty hands when I watch videos 

3770
02:48:03,240 --> 02:48:03,910
of that because I know the power of the 
wave and I'm like,

3771
02:48:04,300 --> 02:48:05,740
they're insane.
How can they,

3772
02:48:05,741 --> 02:48:08,920
it's like huge,
like just because some of them do,

3773
02:48:08,950 --> 02:48:10,360
you know,
end up in the whitewash.

3774
02:48:10,361 --> 02:48:13,060
And it's like how powerful that must be 
upfront.

3775
02:48:13,550 --> 02:48:18,550
Dorian.
He's one of those world record holder 

3776
02:48:18,550 --> 02:48:21,860
champion type,
big wave surfer dudes and I've seen some

3777
02:48:21,861 --> 02:48:23,580
videos of him doing it.
It's just,

3778
02:48:23,581 --> 02:48:24,860
it's.
I don't understand.

3779
02:48:24,940 --> 02:48:27,050
He's loud.
He laughs about it when you bring it up.

3780
02:48:27,051 --> 02:48:29,010
It's just what he does,
but it's.

3781
02:48:29,380 --> 02:48:31,160
I,
I've seen videos of him doing it.

3782
02:48:31,190 --> 02:48:32,300
What does this.
Is this ham?

3783
02:48:32,360 --> 02:48:33,170
Yeah.
Here it goes.

3784
02:48:33,171 --> 02:48:36,140
Jesus christ.
Jaws to look at it like,

3785
02:48:36,141 --> 02:48:38,810
come on.
I go bow hunting with that dude.

3786
02:48:39,290 --> 02:48:42,440
Went in Hawaii,
went to lanai and we,

3787
02:48:42,480 --> 02:48:45,950
we both wanted to look at us like how,
how big those waves are and he's right.

3788
02:48:46,690 --> 02:48:48,620
So he came up out of that.
Oh,

3789
02:48:48,750 --> 02:48:53,750
it's so crazy.
If that came down on you,

3790
02:48:54,151 --> 02:48:59,151
you're dealing with what?
A million pounds of water and I don't 

3791
02:48:59,151 --> 02:49:01,950
even know how like I want to know how 
they like survive that stuff because it 

3792
02:49:01,950 --> 02:49:03,150
does come down on them.
Well,

3793
02:49:03,310 --> 02:49:07,440
I just think the.
This is how he lives

3794
02:49:08,040 --> 02:49:09,420
his life.
He loves it.

3795
02:49:09,870 --> 02:49:14,870
I mean,
I think he's been doing this for a long 

3796
02:49:14,870 --> 02:49:17,601
time and it's just a natural part of 
life to him and he lives on the big 

3797
02:49:17,601 --> 02:49:18,660
island.
This is insane.

3798
02:49:18,820 --> 02:49:20,610
Totally insane.
He's clapping.

3799
02:49:20,880 --> 02:49:25,880
He's clapping in the middle of it.
It's like he's obviously having a great 

3800
02:49:25,880 --> 02:49:26,070
old time.
Fuck that.

3801
02:49:26,520 --> 02:49:27,510
For sure.
I mean,

3802
02:49:27,680 --> 02:49:29,490
I like surfing,
but I wouldn't do that.

3803
02:49:29,940 --> 02:49:31,320
Yeah.
And the sharks too.

3804
02:49:31,321 --> 02:49:36,321
I mean the big island,
like you always hear about people get 

3805
02:49:36,321 --> 02:49:36,570
bit by shark,
especially tiger sharks.

3806
02:49:37,040 --> 02:49:42,040
Is that where bethany hamilton,
the one that the girl that lost her arm 

3807
02:49:42,040 --> 02:49:42,120
machine in Hawaii?
I believe so.

3808
02:49:42,210 --> 02:49:43,630
I believe so,
yeah.

3809
02:49:43,640 --> 02:49:44,670
That.
How about that?

3810
02:49:44,850 --> 02:49:46,470
The little kid loses her arm.
She's like,

3811
02:49:46,471 --> 02:49:51,471
well I got another one still crazy.
It just shows you how awesome surfing 

3812
02:49:52,471 --> 02:49:52,900
was.
Bay,

3813
02:49:52,901 --> 02:49:55,260
but not for me.

3814
02:49:55,470 --> 02:49:58,200
I wouldn't be that awesome for me either
and I haven't gone back out.

3815
02:49:58,201 --> 02:50:03,201
I mean I'm just,
I can only get like I've got so much 

3816
02:50:03,201 --> 02:50:05,571
time in the day to like work out and I 
need to like I need to get the biggest 

3817
02:50:05,571 --> 02:50:05,571
bang for my buck.
Yeah.

3818
02:50:05,571 --> 02:50:07,410
So you're back running now.
I'm actually having,

3819
02:50:07,411 --> 02:50:09,690
I haven't gone back running,
I'm planning on it.

3820
02:50:09,691 --> 02:50:14,691
Like what are you doing for exercise?
High intensity spin stuff so you can 

3821
02:50:14,691 --> 02:50:16,700
continue that one months.
Your son you said is five.

3822
02:50:16,740 --> 02:50:18,840
He's four months old.
So yeah.

3823
02:50:18,860 --> 02:50:23,860
So you,
how long are you going to give yourself 

3824
02:50:23,860 --> 02:50:25,641
before you try to start running?
You think after the holidays I'm going 

3825
02:50:25,641 --> 02:50:25,641
to do it.
Yeah.

3826
02:50:25,641 --> 02:50:26,590
What about things like crossfit or 
something like that?

3827
02:50:27,190 --> 02:50:28,470
Well,
I only have so much time.

3828
02:50:28,860 --> 02:50:32,610
I think the organized I like to spin and
like I said,

3829
02:50:32,611 --> 02:50:33,780
it's not like your dance you spend.

3830
02:50:33,780 --> 02:50:34,860
I tried that,
I didn't like that.

3831
02:50:35,220 --> 02:50:40,220
Um,
you do a lot of weight lifting type 

3832
02:50:40,220 --> 02:50:40,350
exercise.
I need to do more.

3833
02:50:40,351 --> 02:50:41,110
Um,
I have like,

3834
02:50:41,130 --> 02:50:43,740
I do it.
I don't have a gym membership anymore.

3835
02:50:43,790 --> 02:50:48,790
Um,
so I have like weights and I'll do it 

3836
02:50:48,790 --> 02:50:48,790
like,
you know,

3837
02:50:48,790 --> 02:50:51,171
at my place,
but I haven't been doing as much of the 

3838
02:50:51,171 --> 02:50:54,510
strength training as I should because 
that's also extremely beneficial.

3839
02:50:54,570 --> 02:50:56,550
And you know,
bone density,

3840
02:50:56,551 --> 02:50:59,370
it's big one density,
muscle mass.

3841
02:50:59,371 --> 02:51:02,520
I mean like there's been studies showing
that people that do strength training,

3842
02:51:02,780 --> 02:51:07,780
like they have a 23 percent lower all 
cause mortality and like a 30 percent 

3843
02:51:07,780 --> 02:51:11,721
lower cancer related mortality,
independent of any other health factors 

3844
02:51:11,721 --> 02:51:14,350
like obesity and all that stuff.
So um,

3845
02:51:14,370 --> 02:51:19,370
you know,
the muscle mass is another thing that's 

3846
02:51:19,370 --> 02:51:21,831
really important.
In fact there was also another 

3847
02:51:21,831 --> 02:51:23,010
interesting study showing that like 
people that had lake strength,

3848
02:51:23,011 --> 02:51:28,011
like their leg strength was correlated 
to like massive improvements in 

3849
02:51:28,011 --> 02:51:28,011
cognitive function.

3850
02:51:29,100 --> 02:51:31,610
Legs,
not arms but only the legs.

3851
02:51:31,611 --> 02:51:35,370
So there are various,
various different exercises we're done,

3852
02:51:35,371 --> 02:51:38,280
like hand grip strength and all that,
but it was leg strength specifically.

3853
02:51:38,580 --> 02:51:41,990
I don't know if it's like something 
bloodflow something about your,

3854
02:51:42,360 --> 02:51:47,360
how strong your legs are,
is somehow somehow indicative of blood 

3855
02:51:47,360 --> 02:51:49,860
flow to the brain are.
So dudes who do squats are jesus.

3856
02:51:50,070 --> 02:51:52,110
If you know anybody who does a lot of 
squads go to them.

3857
02:51:52,230 --> 02:51:53,550
So I do,
I do air squats,

3858
02:51:54,270 --> 02:51:55,590
body weight squats.
Yeah.

3859
02:51:55,620 --> 02:51:56,730
I do those.
And like,

3860
02:51:56,770 --> 02:52:01,770
you know,
do the hindi are ones where you come up 

3861
02:52:01,770 --> 02:52:04,100
on the ball of your foot,
do you kind of jump as well?

3862
02:52:04,520 --> 02:52:06,050
No.
You can do

3863
02:52:06,120 --> 02:52:07,150
squats.
You,

3864
02:52:07,180 --> 02:52:08,180
um,
you,

3865
02:52:08,870 --> 02:52:13,870
I could do it for you real quick.
Essentially you start off like this and 

3866
02:52:13,961 --> 02:52:18,961
then as you go down your heels come up 
off the ground like this and then your 

3867
02:52:19,391 --> 02:52:21,940
hand touches the floor and then you come
up.

3868
02:52:22,300 --> 02:52:27,300
And what it really does is it works the 
quadriceps really well around the knees 

3869
02:52:27,300 --> 02:52:31,110
and a lot of people find it to be an 
excellent stability exercise called.

3870
02:52:31,330 --> 02:52:32,880
What do they call it?
Hindu squeegees.

3871
02:52:33,010 --> 02:52:33,970
Here.
This guy's going to do it.

3872
02:52:34,010 --> 02:52:36,880
This one,
see how's he's going up on his heels.

3873
02:52:36,940 --> 02:52:39,070
This is like part of it.
He dropped down.

3874
02:52:39,071 --> 02:52:42,550
Your heels come up and then as you press
up when he's not,

3875
02:52:42,640 --> 02:52:44,500
he's not dropping his heels as he comes 
up,

3876
02:52:44,501 --> 02:52:46,300
which I think is weird.
He's,

3877
02:52:46,301 --> 02:52:51,301
I think he's doing a kind of a Variation
on hindu squats because his heels are 

3878
02:52:51,301 --> 02:52:51,301
never coming down.

3879
02:52:51,301 --> 02:52:53,860
He's also wearing raised heel shoes,
which I don't agree with.

3880
02:52:53,910 --> 02:52:55,390
Your heels come all the way down when 
you come up.

3881
02:52:55,720 --> 02:52:57,190
Yeah,
yeah.

3882
02:52:57,280 --> 02:52:58,900
Once you go heels,
go all the way down.

3883
02:52:59,080 --> 02:53:01,330
See if you can find someone who's like,
I just don't.

3884
02:53:01,430 --> 02:53:03,910
Those shoes are not.
Those aren't wise.

3885
02:53:04,150 --> 02:53:06,460
Those shoes were invented.
Those kind of shoes are.

3886
02:53:06,461 --> 02:53:11,461
Those are running shoes that are 
invented back when nike came up with 

3887
02:53:11,461 --> 02:53:13,210
them where you land on the heel instead 
of landing on the ball of the foot,

3888
02:53:13,211 --> 02:53:16,120
which the way your foot is naturally 
supposed to absorb shock,

3889
02:53:16,680 --> 02:53:17,100
you know,
not.

3890
02:53:17,190 --> 02:53:18,580
You know.
I'm sure you know about all that.

3891
02:53:18,610 --> 02:53:20,710
We're nike sort of changed the gate.
No,

3892
02:53:20,760 --> 02:53:25,760
nope.
Nike literally changed the way people 

3893
02:53:25,760 --> 02:53:27,991
run.
They put this big fat heel and the back 

3894
02:53:27,991 --> 02:53:28,540
of your sneaker and people started 
running on the heel.

3895
02:53:28,541 --> 02:53:29,800
Instead of running on the ball of the 
foot.

3896
02:53:30,010 --> 02:53:33,040
When you land on the ball of your foot,
your foot is a natural shock absorber,

3897
02:53:33,610 --> 02:53:38,610
and what they did was made people run 
with their heel first lifted fight.

3898
02:53:39,250 --> 02:53:41,380
It's not good.
It's terrible for your knees.

3899
02:53:41,381 --> 02:53:45,190
It's terrible for a lot of things and 
people develop all sorts of issues.

3900
02:53:45,610 --> 02:53:50,610
You run into that with running long 
distances and knee problems because I'm 

3901
02:53:50,610 --> 02:53:53,200
sure I used to be a jump rope or I was a
professional drunk.

3902
02:53:53,201 --> 02:53:55,260
Proper.
When you professional jump roper,

3903
02:53:55,280 --> 02:53:57,330
I want to get paid.
Well we,

3904
02:53:57,350 --> 02:54:02,350
we got um,
we were sponsored by like the american 

3905
02:54:02,350 --> 02:54:02,350
heart association really.
We had like,

3906
02:54:02,350 --> 02:54:03,760
um,
donations and stuff.

3907
02:54:04,080 --> 02:54:04,770
But uh,
yeah,

3908
02:54:04,850 --> 02:54:09,850
so I started jumping rope.
It's called the international rope 

3909
02:54:09,850 --> 02:54:09,850
skipping organization at that time.
That's hilarious.

3910
02:54:09,850 --> 02:54:14,640
I think it's called like the universal 
universal rope skipping organization 

3911
02:54:14,640 --> 02:54:14,640
now,
but I was,

3912
02:54:14,640 --> 02:54:18,600
I would compete so we,
we'd go every year and compete with 

3913
02:54:18,600 --> 02:54:18,600
other teams from around the world.

3914
02:54:18,970 --> 02:54:21,810
I would travel to other places,
other parts of the u,

3915
02:54:21,811 --> 02:54:26,811
s and setup,
do demonstrations in schools inside of 

3916
02:54:26,811 --> 02:54:26,811
teams.
Anyways,

3917
02:54:26,811 --> 02:54:29,190
I was really good and I can still jump 
rope like I could do next.

3918
02:54:29,240 --> 02:54:33,120
Like next time I see you like jump,
like if you have a jump rope or if I can

3919
02:54:33,130 --> 02:54:35,470
remember to bring one,
like I'll bring one for you next time.

3920
02:54:35,500 --> 02:54:37,810
Next time you get to do two things,
you've got to try out the tank.

3921
02:54:37,840 --> 02:54:42,840
Coming here early.
We'll set you up with the isolation 

3922
02:54:42,840 --> 02:54:42,840
tank.
We'll do a sauna.

3923
02:54:42,840 --> 02:54:44,830
We should do a podcast on.
That would be awesome.

3924
02:54:44,831 --> 02:54:46,660
We're going to start doing that because 
we have the sauna here.

3925
02:54:46,661 --> 02:54:49,310
We're going to do a little podcast last 
long.

3926
02:54:49,370 --> 02:54:54,370
Yeah,
the heat with the recording equipment 

3927
02:54:54,370 --> 02:54:54,370
and stuff,
but if it breaks it breaks.

3928
02:54:54,370 --> 02:54:58,280
I just like.
There's more new interesting stuff on 

3929
02:54:58,280 --> 02:55:01,141
the sauna like that.
I would love to talk to you about like 

3930
02:55:01,141 --> 02:55:01,930
new studies coming out and so next one.
Next one.

3931
02:55:02,350 --> 02:55:04,070
Scheduled a couple of from now and then 
the jump rope.

3932
02:55:04,610 --> 02:55:06,350
Jump rope.
Jumping on the balls of your feet.

3933
02:55:06,351 --> 02:55:07,580
That was the point as I was going to 
say,

3934
02:55:07,581 --> 02:55:10,220
if you jumped on the heels,
it was awful.

3935
02:55:10,221 --> 02:55:12,410
It was like sound.
Would imagine it'd be teRrible,

3936
02:55:12,590 --> 02:55:15,620
but when you look at a running shoe,
you think of an average running shoe.

3937
02:55:15,621 --> 02:55:17,960
The average running shoe has a lifted 
heel.

3938
02:55:18,170 --> 02:55:21,950
Now people are understanding that this 
is negative and this is bad for you,

3939
02:55:21,951 --> 02:55:24,680
so you.
You see what are called zero drop shoes,

3940
02:55:24,730 --> 02:55:28,790
like the vibrams or minimal issues as 
what I run in.

3941
02:55:28,791 --> 02:55:31,610
I run in either a vibrams or running 
those.

3942
02:55:31,660 --> 02:55:35,060
I have some murals that are running into
and what they're essentially they have a

3943
02:55:35,061 --> 02:55:36,400
wide toe box,
so you're,

3944
02:55:36,460 --> 02:55:39,650
you're toast splay out and there's 
almost no padding.

3945
02:55:39,680 --> 02:55:44,680
There's is very little bad before.
It's just enough of a hard cover to keep

3946
02:55:46,161 --> 02:55:49,670
you from getting cut from like rocks and
stuff.

3947
02:55:49,670 --> 02:55:53,470
So that for me is when I tried them out,
I was running on hard concrete who um,

3948
02:55:53,600 --> 02:55:58,600
it was like I was running around this 
lake because I lived in oakland at the 

3949
02:55:58,600 --> 02:55:59,300
time and um,
and so I didn't really like it.

3950
02:55:59,360 --> 02:56:01,560
Were you running on the heels of your 
feet out all your calls?

3951
02:56:01,830 --> 02:56:03,380
Yeah,
it's too much.

3952
02:56:03,510 --> 02:56:08,510
It's too much because of the concrete,
but I think even that is okay if you 

3953
02:56:08,510 --> 02:56:09,840
build up to build up,
but you,

3954
02:56:10,000 --> 02:56:13,490
but you develop your foot strength 
changes radically.

3955
02:56:13,580 --> 02:56:18,580
So maybe I'll get some again and try.
You've got to go slow because we'll be 

3956
02:56:18,580 --> 02:56:18,580
training.
It's probably a lot easier to.

3957
02:56:18,580 --> 02:56:23,560
Yeah,
I run the beach and those when I'm on 

3958
02:56:23,560 --> 02:56:23,560
vacation,
I'll run with a minimal shoes,

3959
02:56:23,570 --> 02:56:28,570
but when you're doing it,
you have to build up to it because you 

3960
02:56:28,570 --> 02:56:32,021
can get plantar fasciitis where you 
start really destroying the bottom of 

3961
02:56:32,021 --> 02:56:32,780
your feet are very common.

3962
02:56:32,840 --> 02:56:37,840
So what do you mean,
like just don't run as long distance or 

3963
02:56:37,840 --> 02:56:37,840
something.
Take your time.

3964
02:56:37,840 --> 02:56:38,360
Yeah,
they like the vibrams.

3965
02:56:38,440 --> 02:56:43,440
Uh,
they got in trouble because they were 

3966
02:56:43,440 --> 02:56:45,410
telling people that their shoes can 
prevent injury and strengthen your feet,

3967
02:56:45,440 --> 02:56:47,780
which they can,
but it takes a long time.

3968
02:56:47,960 --> 02:56:50,420
So what would happen is people would 
say,

3969
02:56:50,421 --> 02:56:50,800
oh,
I'm gonna.

3970
02:56:50,820 --> 02:56:52,580
Use these shoes going to prevent injury.
Fuck,

3971
02:56:52,581 --> 02:56:55,790
I'm injured because they would feed a 
week.

3972
02:56:55,880 --> 02:57:00,230
The idea is that your feet in regular 
shoes are essentially like in a cast.

3973
02:57:00,700 --> 02:57:02,030
This is what your feet are like,
you're,

3974
02:57:02,031 --> 02:57:04,280
you're relying on the structure of the 
shoe.

3975
02:57:04,520 --> 02:57:09,520
It's tightening up around your foot.
You have a nice fat cushion to the 

3976
02:57:09,520 --> 02:57:13,151
bottom of it and you're using minimal 
musculature of your toes and all of the 

3977
02:57:13,401 --> 02:57:18,401
different fee.
You're not articulating everything is 

3978
02:57:18,401 --> 02:57:21,791
individual joints and pushing with all 
the muscles and so when you switched 

3979
02:57:22,371 --> 02:57:24,190
from a thick,
fat running shoe,

3980
02:57:24,200 --> 02:57:29,200
like a vibrams five finger this,
there's definitely a adoptation curve 

3981
02:57:29,890 --> 02:57:31,200
and you have to be careful with that.

3982
02:57:31,420 --> 02:57:36,420
I,
I certainly think because when I was 

3983
02:57:36,420 --> 02:57:36,420
doing it,
I was running long distances.

3984
02:57:36,420 --> 02:57:40,240
Like I just,
I didn't ease into it at all either and 

3985
02:57:40,240 --> 02:57:43,211
I was doing it on concrete.
My friend neil brennan got plantar 

3986
02:57:43,211 --> 02:57:45,020
fasciitis from running on a treadmill in
with vibrams.

3987
02:57:45,021 --> 02:57:47,960
YeAh.
He's running on treadmills as well.

3988
02:57:48,800 --> 02:57:50,160
I'm just kidding.
Uh,

3989
02:57:50,240 --> 02:57:51,580
I'd say that to them.
um,

3990
02:57:51,710 --> 02:57:52,500
but,
uh,

3991
02:57:52,520 --> 02:57:54,080
yeah,
he just got too crazy with it.

3992
02:57:54,100 --> 02:57:55,730
He's,
he's kind of obsessive person.

3993
02:57:55,731 --> 02:57:57,050
He,
he got into it and he's like,

3994
02:57:57,051 --> 02:57:58,040
oh,
this is the thing.

3995
02:57:58,050 --> 02:58:00,050
I'm going to do this now in Iran,
a few mIles.

3996
02:58:00,051 --> 02:58:02,070
And he blew himself out like right

3997
02:58:02,070 --> 02:58:03,430
away.
He fucked up his feet.

3998
02:58:03,840 --> 02:58:05,190
You reverse that?
Yes.

3999
02:58:05,191 --> 02:58:06,600
Yeah.
It takes a while to heal though.

4000
02:58:06,601 --> 02:58:11,601
It's a very painful.
I know quite a few people that have 

4001
02:58:11,601 --> 02:58:11,601
gotten plantar fasciitis and you,
you know,

4002
02:58:11,601 --> 02:58:12,390
you get out of bed,
he could barely walk.

4003
02:58:12,720 --> 02:58:13,860
I think my mother in law.
How to.

4004
02:58:13,960 --> 02:58:14,670
Yeah,
it's rough.

4005
02:58:15,030 --> 02:58:16,230
It's rough.
So,

4006
02:58:16,231 --> 02:58:16,850
uh,
I didn't.

4007
02:58:17,280 --> 02:58:19,920
Luckily I've done martial arts my whole 
life.

4008
02:58:19,930 --> 02:58:20,430
Sorry,
my feet.

4009
02:58:20,460 --> 02:58:25,460
My feet are pretty strong,
but I noticed a big difference between 

4010
02:58:25,460 --> 02:58:30,350
running with minimal minimalistic shoes.
I mean just my feet just feel stronger 

4011
02:58:30,350 --> 02:58:31,290
or they just,
they feel different.

4012
02:58:31,320 --> 02:58:32,880
They feel different when I'm walking 
around.

4013
02:58:32,881 --> 02:58:35,610
My archers raised up.
I've always had flat feet.

4014
02:58:35,940 --> 02:58:39,420
My arches have actually gotten higher 
and like my,

4015
02:58:39,421 --> 02:58:44,421
just the overall dexterity in my feet.
One place where I really feel it is in 

4016
02:58:44,421 --> 02:58:45,630
yoga and notice a big difference in 
yoga.

4017
02:58:45,631 --> 02:58:47,250
I have just more foot strength.

4018
02:58:47,900 --> 02:58:52,900
I'm going to try out.
The rebrand was again throughout my 

4019
02:58:52,900 --> 02:58:54,761
other ones,
but my feet are like bigger now after 

4020
02:58:54,761 --> 02:58:54,761
pregnancy.
So that's funny.

4021
02:58:54,761 --> 02:58:57,310
Like it stretches your feet out abbott,
maybe it's like,

4022
02:58:57,520 --> 02:58:58,910
you know,
maybe it's a cannon

4023
02:58:58,940 --> 02:59:00,320
to a weightlifting,
right?

4024
02:59:00,520 --> 02:59:05,520
Because you think it about it.
You have all this extra weight in your 

4025
02:59:05,520 --> 02:59:07,721
body,
you're carrying around your feet and 

4026
02:59:07,721 --> 02:59:07,721
your hips and.

4027
02:59:07,721 --> 02:59:07,721
Right.
Yeah.

4028
02:59:07,721 --> 02:59:12,090
Yeah.
You definitely have a lot of extra 

4029
02:59:12,090 --> 02:59:12,090
weight.
I mean,

4030
02:59:12,090 --> 02:59:12,090
it seems like it like

4031
02:59:12,090 --> 02:59:14,770
pound vest on your back and you did a 
lot of exercises with a 40 pound best.

4032
02:59:15,090 --> 02:59:16,950
Your bones are going to get more dense.
Right?

4033
02:59:17,570 --> 02:59:19,400
Yeah.
I would like to know.

4034
02:59:19,401 --> 02:59:19,940
I mean,
I know,

4035
02:59:19,941 --> 02:59:23,030
I know certainly my feet were bigger 
during pregnancy because of the swelling

4036
02:59:23,031 --> 02:59:23,530
and stuff,
but,

4037
02:59:23,710 --> 02:59:26,900
but I'm four months out and my feet are 
definitely bigger.

4038
02:59:26,990 --> 02:59:30,780
Are they longer and wider?
The wider there?

4039
02:59:30,810 --> 02:59:33,320
Probably you have more meat in your 
foot.

4040
02:59:33,670 --> 02:59:35,270
Wider.
I was shocked.

4041
02:59:35,300 --> 02:59:40,300
I couldn't like this,
a pair of shoes that I'm supposed to 

4042
02:59:40,300 --> 02:59:40,490
fit.
It didn't fit and it was,

4043
02:59:40,580 --> 02:59:41,750
I was like,
you know,

4044
02:59:41,780 --> 02:59:44,210
it was too narrow.
I bet that totally makes sense.

4045
02:59:44,510 --> 02:59:46,430
I mean,
think about how much weight did you gain

4046
02:59:46,460 --> 02:59:47,860
you allowed to ask gals that?
Um,

4047
02:59:47,900 --> 02:59:50,150
I.
So I actually lost all the weight,

4048
02:59:50,151 --> 02:59:51,970
so I'm allowed to ask.
I've,

4049
02:59:51,971 --> 02:59:53,330
I've lost a lot,
most of it,

4050
02:59:53,331 --> 02:59:54,620
but I still,
you know,

4051
02:59:54,621 --> 02:59:56,240
there's,
there's this a little more to me,

4052
02:59:56,241 --> 02:59:59,030
but my god,
it's crazy.

4053
02:59:59,120 --> 03:00:00,500
It's amazing that we bounced back.

4054
03:00:01,010 --> 03:00:05,150
I gained probably more I would get,
they say like 30 pounds.

4055
03:00:05,151 --> 03:00:07,880
I gained the close to 50.
I know women to gain 80,

4056
03:00:08,330 --> 03:00:12,880
but I was eating all healthy foods.
I started out very thin maybe and that,

4057
03:00:12,950 --> 03:00:15,930
so I was talking to my ob gyn about that
and um,

4058
03:00:16,190 --> 03:00:20,080
he was telling me that really because I 
didn't like look obese or anything.

4059
03:00:20,081 --> 03:00:21,210
It wasn't ambitious.
I start,

4060
03:00:21,230 --> 03:00:22,700
when you start off with a starting 
point,

4061
03:00:22,820 --> 03:00:24,680
your body wants you to gain a certain 
amount of weight.

4062
03:00:24,740 --> 03:00:29,740
Sure.
And so my body wanted me to gaIn 50 

4063
03:00:29,740 --> 03:00:32,180
pounds and I had an eight pound 10 ounce
boy and just think about 50 years

4064
03:00:32,190 --> 03:00:37,190
pounds on your back for nine months.
Of course your feet are going to get 

4065
03:00:37,190 --> 03:00:37,190
bigger.

4066
03:00:37,190 --> 03:00:38,630
They're going to be stronger.
Yeah.

4067
03:00:38,690 --> 03:00:43,690
It was an interesting study showing the 
v max actually improve vo two max 

4068
03:00:43,690 --> 03:00:45,230
improves after pregnancy.
Sure.

4069
03:00:45,400 --> 03:00:50,400
Makes sense.
it's kind of like training in I have a 

4070
03:00:50,400 --> 03:00:50,630
bath or whatever.
Yeah,

4071
03:00:50,890 --> 03:00:55,890
I have this thing.
It's called a company called 

4072
03:00:55,890 --> 03:00:57,781
outdoorsmen.
They make a pack that's designed to 

4073
03:00:57,781 --> 03:00:58,430
condition people for backpack hunting.
Um,

4074
03:00:58,440 --> 03:00:59,530
when you,
you go,

4075
03:00:59,531 --> 03:00:59,980
uh,
you

4076
03:01:00,010 --> 03:01:02,950
carry everything.
He carry your entire camp on your back,

4077
03:01:02,951 --> 03:01:07,330
so you carry your sleeping bag.
I'm a jet boil.

4078
03:01:07,331 --> 03:01:11,620
One of those tanks that you cook on,
you carry all of your equipment,

4079
03:01:11,650 --> 03:01:13,720
you carry everything that you ate,
all your food.

4080
03:01:14,140 --> 03:01:14,530
I mean,
you,

4081
03:01:14,531 --> 03:01:17,560
you could carry as much when you,
when you're wearing a backpack,

4082
03:01:17,561 --> 03:01:20,650
when you're going into camp,
you could carry as much as 70,

4083
03:01:20,800 --> 03:01:25,800
80 pounds on your back.
So what they do this company called 

4084
03:01:25,800 --> 03:01:26,950
outdoorsmen is they make a pack frame 
that has a,

4085
03:01:26,980 --> 03:01:31,980
an olympic plate bolt on the back of it.
We slide olympic plates on it and you 

4086
03:01:31,980 --> 03:01:33,870
clamp them down.
So you have like a,

4087
03:01:33,910 --> 03:01:36,250
like literally an olympic weight on your
back.

4088
03:01:36,251 --> 03:01:41,251
You could put a 45 pound plate or a 90 
pound plate and you do hike to condition

4089
03:01:41,351 --> 03:01:46,351
yourself.
So they have the right posture and 

4090
03:01:46,351 --> 03:01:46,351
you're building that.

4091
03:01:46,351 --> 03:01:46,351
Exactly.
Exactly.

4092
03:01:46,351 --> 03:01:48,790
it's,
it's one of the best ways,

4093
03:01:48,990 --> 03:01:53,990
like weighted pack exercises is one of 
the best ways to prepare yourself for 

4094
03:01:53,990 --> 03:01:58,261
that.
That's really one of the only ways 

4095
03:01:58,261 --> 03:01:58,261
because you're dealing with many,
many miles of hiking.

4096
03:01:58,261 --> 03:01:59,590
That's kind of cool because I've,
I've often,

4097
03:01:59,591 --> 03:02:04,591
like,
I haven't really ever done any like big 

4098
03:02:04,591 --> 03:02:04,591
camping like that,
you know,

4099
03:02:04,591 --> 03:02:08,011
I'm,
I'm always like go for a hike of the 

4100
03:02:08,011 --> 03:02:08,011
day,
come back,

4101
03:02:08,011 --> 03:02:08,011
go to the cabin,
you know,

4102
03:02:08,011 --> 03:02:11,820
it's kind of fun to do that,
like where you hike many miles in and 

4103
03:02:11,820 --> 03:02:14,550
take up a camp and you know,
so um,

4104
03:02:14,590 --> 03:02:17,080
but I thought like,
how am I going to carry all that stuff?

4105
03:02:17,140 --> 03:02:18,370
It's grueling.
Yeah.

4106
03:02:18,371 --> 03:02:20,260
I can imagine like there's no way I 
could do that much,

4107
03:02:20,261 --> 03:02:25,261
but when some people do it,
if they're only going to go for a few 

4108
03:02:25,261 --> 03:02:28,590
days,
they can get it down to as little as 40 

4109
03:02:28,590 --> 03:02:28,590
pounds.

4110
03:02:28,590 --> 03:02:28,590
You know?
Some people are super minimalist,

4111
03:02:28,590 --> 03:02:33,511
like my friend adam,
he does it for many stretches at a time 

4112
03:02:33,511 --> 03:02:34,030
and he'll do like 28 days in the bush by
himself.

4113
03:02:34,110 --> 03:02:36,970
He lives in Australia.
He's done it in Montana to one.

4114
03:02:36,971 --> 03:02:41,971
Um,
he did it and documented it all on his 

4115
03:02:41,971 --> 03:02:41,971
instagram story,
but he's so extreme.

4116
03:02:41,971 --> 03:02:45,070
He cuts hIs toothbrush and half,
like he only has the,

4117
03:02:45,150 --> 03:02:50,150
he cuts weight in so many different 
places that the handle of his 

4118
03:02:50,150 --> 03:02:50,470
toothbrush,
it cuts off.

4119
03:02:50,530 --> 03:02:54,430
So he's brushIng his teeth with like the
little end part of it toothbrush,

4120
03:02:54,640 --> 03:02:57,530
which I think is just stupid.
Like how much weight are you saving?

4121
03:02:57,531 --> 03:02:58,690
C'mon man.
It's ridiculous.

4122
03:02:58,960 --> 03:03:01,120
Give yourself a real toothbrushes 
psycho.

4123
03:03:01,930 --> 03:03:06,930
But these people I'm really concentrated
on making things as minimal as possible.

4124
03:03:07,421 --> 03:03:11,010
Bringing as little gear as possible and 
just gettIng all dialed in.

4125
03:03:11,020 --> 03:03:13,510
You have to kind of figure out how much 
water you need,

4126
03:03:13,511 --> 03:03:14,290
how much food you need.

4127
03:03:14,680 --> 03:03:19,680
Most of the time they map out,
they'll use like I'm a google earth and 

4128
03:03:19,680 --> 03:03:22,400
map out where the natural springs are 
and try to figure out uh,

4129
03:03:22,420 --> 03:03:27,420
how much water they have to bring with 
them and how much they can get from 

4130
03:03:27,420 --> 03:03:31,081
these sources.
And so then they have to have either a 

4131
03:03:31,081 --> 03:03:32,971
steri pim or some sort of filtration 
system to clean out the water to make 

4132
03:03:32,971 --> 03:03:35,950
sure that they don't get to understand 
how,

4133
03:03:36,220 --> 03:03:39,250
what's the longest amount of tIme that 
you've done?

4134
03:03:39,251 --> 03:03:44,251
Like one of these campaigns.
I've never done it where they did it 

4135
03:03:44,251 --> 03:03:46,290
like that where I carried my camp on my 
back and I lived out there for.

4136
03:03:46,390 --> 03:03:51,390
The only time I've ever done it is with 
a group of guys and we've camped for a 

4137
03:03:51,390 --> 03:03:53,620
week in Montana.
But we brought everything in on canoes.

4138
03:03:53,730 --> 03:03:56,560
So we had all these supplies.
We brought them in on boats.

4139
03:03:56,770 --> 03:03:58,460
We got out,
we staked our tents

4140
03:03:58,460 --> 03:04:00,710
and we had food with us just,
you know.

4141
03:04:01,250 --> 03:04:04,220
But I know a lot of guys do it and they 
don't bring much food.

4142
03:04:04,221 --> 03:04:09,221
They just try to live off the land.
They just try to get successful quick 

4143
03:04:09,221 --> 03:04:09,221
with the hunting.
And then theory.

4144
03:04:09,840 --> 03:04:13,310
It's crazy,
but it's the added challenge of it,

4145
03:04:13,860 --> 03:04:15,690
you know,
but the weight.

4146
03:04:15,710 --> 03:04:20,390
But the point being that weighted 
backpacks or an excellent cardiovascular

4147
03:04:20,391 --> 03:04:25,391
exercise.
So to me just make sense of being 

4148
03:04:25,391 --> 03:04:28,420
pregnant.
It would make your feet stronger and 

4149
03:04:28,420 --> 03:04:28,490
increase your vo two max and a lot of 
walking four miles a day.

4150
03:04:28,880 --> 03:04:32,180
I know what I was doing.
A great thing that there's this girl,

4151
03:04:32,270 --> 03:04:34,940
this woman in my spin class and she's 
like,

4152
03:04:34,941 --> 03:04:39,941
you can ask them.
She's about to have this baby like any 

4153
03:04:39,941 --> 03:04:39,941
day and she's their bike and away.
And I'm like,

4154
03:04:39,941 --> 03:04:40,480
geez.
Yeah.

4155
03:04:40,481 --> 03:04:41,720
So she used to get crazy with it.

4156
03:04:41,720 --> 03:04:43,070
She's real tiny.
Like,

4157
03:04:43,071 --> 03:04:45,560
I mean I look back at pictures of me and
I'm like,

4158
03:04:46,100 --> 03:04:51,100
I can't believe I like bounce back from 
that because it's just like I'm just so 

4159
03:04:51,100 --> 03:04:51,850
enormous,
you know?

4160
03:04:51,870 --> 03:04:52,760
It's,
it's crazy.

4161
03:04:52,890 --> 03:04:54,500
It's incredible.
the whole thing is incredible.

4162
03:04:54,530 --> 03:04:56,720
Do you think you're going to do it again
or you want it done?

4163
03:04:56,990 --> 03:05:01,130
I think I might be one and done.
I don't know for sure,

4164
03:05:01,131 --> 03:05:06,131
but you know,
I spent some time to think you only got 

4165
03:05:06,131 --> 03:05:06,131
four months old.
I got a little bit of time to think,

4166
03:05:06,131 --> 03:05:10,990
right.
I mean like I've got pressure like my 

4167
03:05:10,990 --> 03:05:10,990
half sister and like other people are 
like,

4168
03:05:10,990 --> 03:05:11,060
okay,
you got to wait a year.

4169
03:05:11,150 --> 03:05:12,290
You got to get pregnant again.
I'm like,

4170
03:05:12,291 --> 03:05:13,960
oh gosh,
you know,

4171
03:05:14,150 --> 03:05:15,980
you don't have to do anything crazy.
It's so good.

4172
03:05:15,981 --> 03:05:17,420
I have one kid.
I kind of,

4173
03:05:17,600 --> 03:05:19,910
I've kind of,
I'm kind of just so in love with him.

4174
03:05:19,910 --> 03:05:21,650
Then I'm like,
I don't want to share my love,

4175
03:05:21,651 --> 03:05:24,020
you know,
having kids,

4176
03:05:24,021 --> 03:05:25,780
like my kids are two years apart,
uh,

4177
03:05:25,940 --> 03:05:29,120
the youngest ones and when they hang out
together it's just amazing.

4178
03:05:29,121 --> 03:05:33,430
You watched them hug each other and they
play games together and you know,

4179
03:05:33,500 --> 03:05:35,320
there's still like little sibling 
rivalries.

4180
03:05:35,330 --> 03:05:36,340
There's always going to be.
But,

4181
03:05:36,580 --> 03:05:39,530
but there's something magical about 
having a sibling,

4182
03:05:39,590 --> 03:05:40,520
you know,
I grew up,

4183
03:05:40,530 --> 03:05:44,780
the sister is one year younger than me.
My brother who's four years younger than

4184
03:05:44,781 --> 03:05:45,220
me.
Yeah.

4185
03:05:45,680 --> 03:05:47,120
I don't know,
just something to it,

4186
03:05:47,480 --> 03:05:52,480
but it's also something to have in one 
kid and given them a lot of attention 

4187
03:05:52,480 --> 03:05:54,860
and being able to do other things too,
like science.

4188
03:05:55,820 --> 03:06:00,820
So speaking to science,
tell people where they can listen to 

4189
03:06:00,820 --> 03:06:03,460
your podcast and contribute to your 
research because you,

4190
03:06:03,461 --> 03:06:04,760
you have,
you have,

4191
03:06:04,790 --> 03:06:06,390
you were saying you have,
what is the,

4192
03:06:06,460 --> 03:06:07,830
the,
the patron,

4193
03:06:09,200 --> 03:06:11,960
patron and also we have a direct 
subscribership where people can,

4194
03:06:12,200 --> 03:06:15,100
if they want me to continue to,
um,

4195
03:06:15,320 --> 03:06:17,300
do the podcast but put out,
um,

4196
03:06:17,350 --> 03:06:18,650
you know,
articles.

4197
03:06:18,710 --> 03:06:21,530
So my podcAst is on itunes,
it's called family fitness,

4198
03:06:21,740 --> 03:06:24,500
but you can go to my website called,
found my fitness.com

4199
03:06:24,501 --> 03:06:29,501
and there's now episode pages we have 
where I'm starting to now put a lot of 

4200
03:06:29,501 --> 03:06:32,150
information and found my fitness on 
instagram,

4201
03:06:33,470 --> 03:06:34,670

there all those codes.

4203
03:06:37,840 --> 03:06:39,620
So here's the episodes and if you click 
on one,

4204
03:06:39,621 --> 03:06:42,980
there's a summary and sometimes we're 
getting transcripts now,

4205
03:06:43,190 --> 03:06:47,240
so I'm going to put a lot more 
information there as well.

4206
03:06:47,241 --> 03:06:48,620
And so yeah,
people are,

4207
03:06:48,650 --> 03:06:49,940
are,
are contributing money,

4208
03:06:49,941 --> 03:06:54,941
whatever they can,
they can do a one tIme or like a one 

4209
03:06:54,941 --> 03:06:54,941
five,
$10 a month.

4210
03:06:54,941 --> 03:06:55,830
Some people do more than that.
And um,

4211
03:06:56,390 --> 03:06:57,540
it's,
it's really cool.

4212
03:06:58,020 --> 03:07:01,940
It really has been a lot of fun and I 
enjoy it like,

4213
03:07:02,200 --> 03:07:03,630
like it's just.
I love it.

4214
03:07:03,720 --> 03:07:04,960
Well,
you're awesome at it and you,

4215
03:07:04,961 --> 03:07:06,270
you're awesome at this too.
I mean,

4216
03:07:06,271 --> 03:07:08,100
it's ridiculous.
You haven't looked at notes once.

4217
03:07:08,101 --> 03:07:13,101
All this shit is all from the top of 
your head for people that are listening 

4218
03:07:13,101 --> 03:07:13,101
to this.
She's not reading off of anything.

4219
03:07:13,101 --> 03:07:14,430
she's just rattling this off.
It's very humbling.

4220
03:07:14,460 --> 03:07:19,460
Thank you.
So thanks for doing this and next time 

4221
03:07:19,460 --> 03:07:19,460
we'll do the tank.
Do the sauna.

4222
03:07:19,460 --> 03:07:20,060
We try to do a podcast host.
I'm gonna.

4223
03:07:20,070 --> 03:07:20,910
Hold you to that.
Okay,

4224
03:07:20,911 --> 03:07:21,870
let's do it.
We'll do it.

4225
03:07:23,930 --> 03:07:24,840
We'll do it.
Okay.

03:07:24,930 --> 03:07:26,520
Thank you so much.
Thanks rhonda.

4227
03:07:26,521 --> 03:07:27,480
Patrick,
ladies and gentlemen.
