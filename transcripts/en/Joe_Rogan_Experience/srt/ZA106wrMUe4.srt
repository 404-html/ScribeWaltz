1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,570
Five,

2
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:01,403
four,

3
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:02,273
three,

4
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:03,173
two.

5
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:04,921
Hello,

6
00:00:04,921 --> 00:00:05,580
Sam Harris.

7
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:06,390
Hey Man.

8
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:06,870
Good to see you.

9
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:07,700
Happy to be here.

10
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:08,080
It's great.

11
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,750
I listened to your podcast with Jack.

12
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:13,020
Let's just get right into the jump in
the Jack stuff because I listened to your

13
00:00:13,021 --> 00:00:17,430
podcast with Jack and I found something
very when I did my podcast with Jack.

14
00:00:17,431 --> 00:00:20,490
First of all was not anticipating
the blowback that I received.

15
00:00:20,491 --> 00:00:21,840
It was stunning.

16
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:22,800
Uh,

17
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,180
but um,

18
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:25,080
he,

19
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:25,560
what,

20
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,560
what I thought was I was just going
to have a conversation with this guy.

21
00:00:28,561 --> 00:00:29,310
Be Fun.

22
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:33,690
See what it's like to run this gigantic
network that helps people communicate.

23
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:34,370
You'll be okay.

24
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:39,300
Jimmy helps people communicate and
distribute information worldwide.

25
00:00:39,301 --> 00:00:42,390
What is it like to start something like
that up and have it become what it is

26
00:00:42,391 --> 00:00:45,510
like how have you managed to try to
keep up with it and one of the headaches

27
00:00:45,511 --> 00:00:48,450
been and apparently people online,

28
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,190
particularly the people that
want to comment about this,

29
00:00:50,191 --> 00:00:55,191
all they wanted to know about with
censorship and that was an issue with me.

30
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:56,340
There was a question with me,

31
00:00:56,341 --> 00:00:57,360
but it became a far,

32
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:59,490
was a far bigger question
for people online.

33
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:04,670
They felt like that I tossed him softball
questions and that I didn't press him

34
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:11,250
and then I listened to your podcast and
one thing about Jack is very smart guy,

35
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,113
very nice guy,

36
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:17,510
buddy talks in a very slow and methodical
way and when you ask him a question,

37
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:23,510
he takes these routes and if you don't
want to jump in and press them like

38
00:01:24,991 --> 00:01:28,770
you're in this weird situation where
he's not totally answering your question,

39
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:32,180
but he's talking about the same
subject that you talked to.

40
00:01:32,181 --> 00:01:33,240
Like for instance,

41
00:01:33,241 --> 00:01:34,560
you brought up Louis Farrakhan,

42
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:38,370
like how's Louis Farrakhan and good
standing on the platform and someone like,

43
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:38,791
you know,

44
00:01:38,791 --> 00:01:39,511
fill in the blank,

45
00:01:39,511 --> 00:01:41,440
Milo Yiannopoulos or Laura loomer,

46
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:42,323
whoever it was,

47
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,260
they get kicked off.

48
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:44,850
He never got to that.

49
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:48,180
He went around and around
and around with you.

50
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:49,940
And um,

51
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,170
he recognized this after the podcast,

52
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:54,140
I received a lot of blowback.

53
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:55,560
He received a lot of blowback.

54
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:00,200
So I contacted him and he said he'd be
more than happy to come back on again and

55
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:01,140
address all these things.

56
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:01,471
And I said,

57
00:02:01,471 --> 00:02:01,920
okay,

58
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,100
what I'd like to do is address specific
instances of people being censored.

59
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:06,451
And he said,

60
00:02:06,451 --> 00:02:06,661
okay,

61
00:02:06,661 --> 00:02:10,680
what I'll do is I'll bring in someone
from the company that's in charge of that

62
00:02:10,681 --> 00:02:11,470
stuff.

63
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:11,820
Right?

64
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:16,620
So I'm starting to put together a
picture of what it's like to be a ceo of

65
00:02:16,621 --> 00:02:19,410
something as big and he's
also a ceo of square.

66
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,270
He's runs the cash app,

67
00:02:21,271 --> 00:02:22,500
there's a lot of stuff going on there,

68
00:02:22,501 --> 00:02:22,681
right?

69
00:02:22,681 --> 00:02:23,970
So He's obviously busy.

70
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:28,860
How much day to day involvement does he
actually have and who gets censored and

71
00:02:28,861 --> 00:02:31,590
why they get censored and how much
is he willing to share about that.

72
00:02:31,591 --> 00:02:35,400
So we're gonna find out in
the next follow up podcast.

73
00:02:35,401 --> 00:02:40,401
But I got accused of everything from
being a shill to being a cook to being a.

74
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:45,090
and there's also an issue that
you've managed to avoid wisely.

75
00:02:45,091 --> 00:02:48,900
So you'll have advertising the cash
apps and advertiser on my podcast.

76
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:53,070
So because the cash apps and advertiser
on my podcast man had you by the throat.

77
00:02:53,071 --> 00:02:53,560
Exactly.

78
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,800
Anything couldn't ask all those
great questions that were queued up.

79
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,000
The reality is,

80
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,070
those are the questions I would've asked.

81
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,370
Now that's hard to say

82
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,750
because no one's gonna believe it,

83
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:05,830
but those are the questions that
were asked and I tried not to be too

84
00:03:05,831 --> 00:03:07,270
confrontational with a guest,

85
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:12,010
but in hindsight I probably could have
pressed more particularly on people like

86
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:15,790
Kathy Griffin calling for doxing for the,

87
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:18,580
the kid with the Maggot hat
on with the native American.

88
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:19,750
There was quite a few,

89
00:03:19,751 --> 00:03:21,940
but I noticed that.

90
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:22,960
Well,

91
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,340
what was your experience like with it?

92
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:24,860
Yeah,

93
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:25,810
so it's interesting.

94
00:03:25,811 --> 00:03:27,670
[inaudible] you and I have a,

95
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:30,250
we had different interviews because
there were time differently.

96
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:31,084
I mean,

97
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:34,960
it's an interesting topic because this
opens the door to all the ways in which

98
00:03:34,961 --> 00:03:36,190
our podcasts are different.

99
00:03:36,191 --> 00:03:36,341
I mean,

100
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:37,660
they use stream live.

101
00:03:37,661 --> 00:03:42,100
I sit on my podcast for at least a week
in Jack's case was like two weeks before

102
00:03:42,101 --> 00:03:42,934
I released it,

103
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:48,270
so I did my interview with him before
this flurry of interviews with him came

104
00:03:49,331 --> 00:03:49,510
out.

105
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:50,950
I mean there's a rolling stone interview.

106
00:03:50,951 --> 00:03:51,784
There was a,

107
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:52,810
uh,

108
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:53,260
I think only,

109
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:55,090
I think maybe a Huffington
post interview would come out,

110
00:03:55,091 --> 00:03:56,650
but basically there was nothing out there,

111
00:03:56,651 --> 00:04:01,651
so I had no real examples of how he dealt
with these questions or how he talked.

112
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:02,300
Yeah,

113
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:02,670
yeah,

114
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:02,801
yeah.

115
00:04:02,801 --> 00:04:03,041
Well,

116
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:03,761
I mean slow talking.

117
00:04:03,761 --> 00:04:05,830
It's not a problem for me because
I'm one of the great slow talker.

118
00:04:05,831 --> 00:04:06,180
So,

119
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,090
so we're,

120
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:08,050
we're in a groove there.

121
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:08,980
Um,

122
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:10,450
but he,

123
00:04:10,451 --> 00:04:11,284
um,

124
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:11,901
I,

125
00:04:11,901 --> 00:04:16,300
I didn't know what his boiler
plate was and how he would,

126
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:17,980
he would answer any of these questions.

127
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:21,760
And your podcast came out before mine did,

128
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:22,360
but mine was,

129
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,970
mine was before the Covington
Highschool Catholic.

130
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:25,690
Oh,

131
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:26,441
circus happened,

132
00:04:26,441 --> 00:04:27,274
right.

133
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:32,280
So the real missed opportunity for me
was just a sheer matter of timing because

134
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:36,640
the commitment thing put such a fine
point on everything that's wrong with

135
00:04:36,641 --> 00:04:38,650
twitter and the way
journalism interacts with it.

136
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:38,801
Right.

137
00:04:38,801 --> 00:04:39,071
And it was,

138
00:04:39,071 --> 00:04:39,580
it just,

139
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:40,230
you know,

140
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:44,980
I think it was a farhad manjoo wrote
an op Ed in the New York Times saying

141
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:46,570
twitter is destroyed journalism and,

142
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:46,840
and,

143
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:49,000
and it was not a crazy op ed.

144
00:04:49,001 --> 00:04:49,834
In fact,

145
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:50,230
uh,

146
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:52,250
after the Covington
thing and the whole unit,

147
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,190
and then Kathy Griffin would've been
the perfect example to talk about it.

148
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:58,000
Like why is she still on if
she's calling for the Doxing,

149
00:04:58,030 --> 00:04:58,300
right?

150
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:58,930
Yeah.

151
00:04:58,930 --> 00:04:59,980
But you know,

152
00:04:59,981 --> 00:05:00,201
I,

153
00:05:00,201 --> 00:05:05,110
I think I had a substantially similar
interview with him that you did,

154
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:05,890
uh,

155
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:07,600
because he's,

156
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:08,891
there's two things.

157
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:12,520
One is he's great at sort
of pure wedding around the,

158
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:12,761
the,

159
00:05:12,761 --> 00:05:13,000
the,

160
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,810
the sharp point of question of what
is the policy and why or why are you

161
00:05:16,811 --> 00:05:19,180
applying it and in this
seemingly disparate way.

162
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:20,040
Uh,

163
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:23,470
and it seems to skew politically
in one direction all the time.

164
00:05:23,471 --> 00:05:24,304
Right.

165
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:27,130
But I think you also,

166
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:28,120
you know,

167
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:28,631
I did,

168
00:05:28,631 --> 00:05:30,250
and I think you did naturally,

169
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:35,200
we cut him some slack in that he's
the CEO of these two corporations.

170
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:40,030
He can't be expected to actually know
what happened in every one of these

171
00:05:40,031 --> 00:05:40,910
microcases.

172
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:41,061
Like,

173
00:05:41,061 --> 00:05:42,430
I think I brought up the case of,

174
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:44,770
I think her name is Megan Murphy.

175
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:46,150
I hadn't even heard of her,

176
00:05:46,151 --> 00:05:50,890
but she's a lesbian woman that she was
a feminist who said sort of the wrong

177
00:05:50,891 --> 00:05:53,150
thing in the transgender space.

178
00:05:53,151 --> 00:05:53,711
She said something like,

179
00:05:53,711 --> 00:05:58,240
men are not women and she
got banned and or to know,

180
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,720
I think it was temporary,

181
00:05:59,721 --> 00:06:00,171
but you know,

182
00:06:00,171 --> 00:06:02,570
so I raised it and you know,

183
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:03,290
he,

184
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:08,030
he obviously can't know exactly what
happened in that case or at least it would

185
00:06:08,031 --> 00:06:09,440
be surprising to me if he knew.

186
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:14,740
So the fact that he doesn't have his
finger on each one of these cases and what

187
00:06:14,991 --> 00:06:15,111
the,

188
00:06:15,111 --> 00:06:16,310
what the rationale was,

189
00:06:16,311 --> 00:06:20,180
and he has this sort of generic
answer that what you're seeing,

190
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:20,690
you know,

191
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:23,360
in public is not necessarily
what we're seeing.

192
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:23,790
In fact,

193
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:28,130
in virtually every actionable case is
not what we're seeing in private with

194
00:06:28,131 --> 00:06:30,110
respect to how these
people are all opening,

195
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:35,000
opening multiple accounts
and doing seemingly nefarious
stuff behind the scenes.

196
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:35,511
Now,

197
00:06:35,511 --> 00:06:37,340
whether that is true,

198
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:38,121
I don't know,

199
00:06:38,121 --> 00:06:41,240
but I mean I can just
say that Jack seemed,

200
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:41,960
um,

201
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:42,201
one,

202
00:06:42,201 --> 00:06:42,340
I,

203
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:42,680
I,

204
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:47,300
I liked him and he seemed unusually open
to talking about anything I wanted to

205
00:06:47,301 --> 00:06:47,780
talk about.

206
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:49,910
So as I saw one allegation
they got a hold of you,

207
00:06:49,911 --> 00:06:50,744
is that,

208
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:51,061
you know,

209
00:06:51,061 --> 00:06:55,220
you must have been constrained by the
topics you couldn't touch in advance.

210
00:06:55,221 --> 00:06:57,380
He must have had some
agreement with him in advance,

211
00:06:58,010 --> 00:06:58,370
you know,

212
00:06:58,370 --> 00:06:59,750
it didn't happen with me right now.

213
00:06:59,751 --> 00:07:00,531
I should address that.

214
00:07:00,531 --> 00:07:01,280
There was no,

215
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,560
no discussion whatsoever
about what was off limits.

216
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:05,000
No nothing.

217
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:05,721
And he asked her.

218
00:07:05,721 --> 00:07:06,000
No.

219
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,370
So in my case,

220
00:07:07,371 --> 00:07:10,710
I tell all my guests and this the
difference between use streaming live and,

221
00:07:10,711 --> 00:07:11,600
and me not,

222
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,070
I tell all my guests,

223
00:07:13,071 --> 00:07:13,820
listen,

224
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:17,060
if at any point in this interview you
put your foot in your mouth or I put my

225
00:07:17,061 --> 00:07:17,810
foot in there,

226
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:18,740
we can edit it,

227
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,010
right?

228
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:19,340
Like we,

229
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:20,151
I want you,

230
00:07:20,151 --> 00:07:23,870
I want you to be totally happy with
what you say over the next two or three

231
00:07:23,871 --> 00:07:24,704
hours.

232
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:25,280
Uh,

233
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,770
so if you have to take something again,

234
00:07:27,771 --> 00:07:29,120
take it again and,

235
00:07:29,121 --> 00:07:29,380
you know,

236
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:30,830
we'll just hide the seams as we go.

237
00:07:30,831 --> 00:07:33,380
Now that virtually never happens.

238
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:33,681
Right?

239
00:07:33,681 --> 00:07:34,560
And in Jack's case,

240
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:36,290
there wasn't even a wrinkle like that.

241
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:37,183
So,

242
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:38,120
um,

243
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:38,560
but,

244
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:38,800
you know,

245
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:38,891
I,

246
00:07:38,891 --> 00:07:39,320
I just,

247
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:39,531
you know,

248
00:07:39,531 --> 00:07:39,671
I,

249
00:07:39,671 --> 00:07:42,650
I recognize it's a high wire
act for a lot of these people,

250
00:07:42,651 --> 00:07:45,200
especially if someone was running
two publicly traded companies.

251
00:07:45,201 --> 00:07:45,500
Right.

252
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,010
And um,

253
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:47,571
you know,

254
00:07:47,571 --> 00:07:48,740
I also want to invite in Amman,

255
00:07:48,741 --> 00:07:49,100
I said,

256
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:49,933
I said jacket,

257
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:51,920
we were DM and on twitter and I said,

258
00:07:51,921 --> 00:07:52,131
listen,

259
00:07:52,131 --> 00:07:56,240
I promise I'm not going to make you
smoke a blunt on video that got him.

260
00:07:56,241 --> 00:07:57,650
So I don't know how you got him,

261
00:07:57,651 --> 00:07:59,470
but I didn't try to get
them to a local boy.

262
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:01,310
I didn't even think about it.

263
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:01,970
Yeah,

264
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:02,691
we weren't drinking,

265
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:03,320
we were just talking.

266
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:06,260
Maybe we'd been better if we were
drinking because it did seem very stiff.

267
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:08,510
I listened to it after the fact and

268
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:15,190
I mean I get from their anticipation
why it would be disappointing.

269
00:08:15,531 --> 00:08:16,880
I just thought it was kind of boring.

270
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,700
I thought my podcast with
them just wasn't very good.

271
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:25,040
I sometimes do too many podcasts and
when I sometimes do too many podcasts,

272
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:29,060
I think I run low on
juice and I'm not as a,

273
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:29,810
I don't know,

274
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:34,810
I'm not as engaged or I'm not as fired
up about it and maybe I just should have.

275
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:36,950
I've definitely should've
prepared more for him,

276
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:40,790
but I really thought it was just going
to be a conversation about what it's like

277
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:43,820
and I thought that would be really
easy to do because it's such a unique

278
00:08:43,821 --> 00:08:45,980
position to be running
something like twitter,

279
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:47,020
but he,

280
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:47,300
you know,

281
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:51,830
I don't know if he was evasive in because
he didn't know the things or because

282
00:08:51,831 --> 00:08:53,570
he didn't want to talk about the things,

283
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:58,500
but there was things like he didn't know
exactly why Alex Jones was ultimately

284
00:08:58,501 --> 00:08:59,334
banned.

285
00:08:59,400 --> 00:08:59,940
He didn't,

286
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,380
he couldn't recall or didn't know.

287
00:09:01,381 --> 00:09:04,020
Now is that because he couldn't recall
it was because he didn't want to talk

288
00:09:04,021 --> 00:09:07,380
about it or is it because
he didn't remember it?

289
00:09:07,381 --> 00:09:07,591
I mean,

290
00:09:07,591 --> 00:09:07,760
I don't.

291
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,310
I don't know.

292
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:08,581
I mean,

293
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:09,414
you'd have to,

294
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:11,400
you'd have to be inside his
head to get that answer.

295
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:11,710
Yeah.

296
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:11,910
I mean,

297
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:12,250
he,

298
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:14,810
he's clearly got a,

299
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:19,850
a very practice line that he uses to
answer these questions and because I,

300
00:09:19,851 --> 00:09:20,250
you know,

301
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:23,490
I know what it's like to have boilerplate
had been a book on a book tour and

302
00:09:23,491 --> 00:09:27,360
you're just basically going to ask the
same questions again and again and here

303
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:32,390
he's getting asked fairly
pointed questions about where
twitter's going and he's

304
00:09:34,051 --> 00:09:34,490
got,

305
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:34,680
you know,

306
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,090
I don't think this is dishonest,

307
00:09:36,091 --> 00:09:36,924
I just think,

308
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:42,050
but it has this amazing ability to close
the door to further inquiry because he,

309
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,210
he gives you the full
mayor Kulpa right upfront.

310
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:47,070
You ask like,

311
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:47,390
what's,

312
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:48,660
what's the situation with,

313
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:49,310
you know,

314
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:51,870
the seemingly asymmetrical
banding of people.

315
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,300
And he'll say,

316
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:53,580
you know,

317
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:53,941
yeah,

318
00:09:53,941 --> 00:09:54,481
we really,

319
00:09:54,481 --> 00:09:56,970
I mean we got to get much better
at communicating our process.

320
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:58,650
We're not nearly transparent enough.

321
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:01,620
This whole thing is in disarray
and my job is to fix it.

322
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:02,221
Right?

323
00:10:02,221 --> 00:10:03,510
So it's like a global,

324
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:04,290
you know,

325
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:06,090
we're fucked up and we're
going to get better.

326
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:06,840
I promise you.

327
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,390
Right.

328
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:08,090
And there's,

329
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:10,050
do any good for the people
that are already banned.

330
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:10,321
Right.

331
00:10:10,321 --> 00:10:10,900
But actually,

332
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:13,740
there's not a lot to get
beyond that in an interview,

333
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:15,660
so it's whether,

334
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,110
you know,

335
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:17,220
I don't think it's nefarious.

336
00:10:17,221 --> 00:10:20,370
I think it could well be totally honest.

337
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:21,120
Uh,

338
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,230
but it does have,

339
00:10:22,231 --> 00:10:26,370
this is a fact of you just keep
reaching a certain kind of brick wall,

340
00:10:26,371 --> 00:10:26,800
but you know,

341
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,633
it was going to be there.

342
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:28,230
Yeah,

343
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:28,911
that's a,

344
00:10:28,911 --> 00:10:29,790
I felt that too.

345
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:30,690
And I didn't,

346
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:35,580
didn't really navigate that very well
and that was a big part of the blow back.

347
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:38,940
But then the blow back was accentuated
when they found out that he sponsors me

348
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:44,280
because the cash APP is one of his
businesses and sponsors the podcast.

349
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:44,910
Yeah.

350
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:45,061
Yeah.

351
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:49,640
Well I had a very similar result and I
don't have that problem so that I don't

352
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:52,020
think that diagnosis
your situation at all.

353
00:10:52,021 --> 00:10:55,920
But it's very interesting that the
difference between these business,

354
00:10:55,950 --> 00:11:00,950
that business models under which we run
our podcasts and I'm just the different

355
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:04,560
mean just every choice you make
and how to produce a podcast.

356
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:06,600
I essentially have made the opposite one,

357
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:06,980
you know,

358
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:10,560
like streaming live like this
ms dot the fact that you're.

359
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:14,460
So this is just all very interesting
to me because I'm a kind of a reluctant

360
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:18,960
student of digital media now because
I've just kind of stumbled into this wild

361
00:11:18,961 --> 00:11:19,620
west that,

362
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:19,890
you know,

363
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:21,690
you in large part have invented,

364
00:11:21,691 --> 00:11:21,930
right?

365
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:23,760
I mean this podcasting space was nothing.

366
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:25,470
And now we've got spotify,

367
00:11:25,471 --> 00:11:25,651
you know,

368
00:11:25,651 --> 00:11:28,200
buying up and it says like
a land grab for audio.

369
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:28,620
Yeah.

370
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:30,630
That we were talking about
that before the podcast.

371
00:11:30,631 --> 00:11:32,700
They just purchased some company.

372
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:33,450
Was it,

373
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:37,800
what is it called for some
godly amount of money,

374
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:39,170
like $200,000,000.

375
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:41,820
Not going to spend $500
this year or something.

376
00:11:41,821 --> 00:11:42,780
And so it's this,

377
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:46,110
we're all just making
this up and you know,

378
00:11:46,111 --> 00:11:47,390
I'm making and you know,

379
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:51,930
I've just released a meditation APP which
is a different business model still as

380
00:11:51,931 --> 00:11:51,961
a.

381
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:56,961
Now I have these kind of two digital
businesses happening in my life and it's

382
00:11:57,401 --> 00:11:58,234
um,

383
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,650
it's just very interesting.

384
00:11:59,651 --> 00:12:02,860
The decisions you make are a force
to make and the consequences of it.

385
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:05,110
And so like the fact that we're
having this conversation live,

386
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:08,020
you don't even have to think about
whether you're going to edit this right,

387
00:12:08,021 --> 00:12:09,580
because it's to be
streaming live and you know,

388
00:12:09,581 --> 00:12:10,130
we're going to,

389
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:10,661
when we're done,

390
00:12:10,661 --> 00:12:15,250
we're going to turn off the mics and walk
out of here and your job is done with

391
00:12:15,251 --> 00:12:15,911
my podcast.

392
00:12:15,911 --> 00:12:17,740
That's not the workflow at all.

393
00:12:17,741 --> 00:12:18,051
And I,

394
00:12:18,051 --> 00:12:18,884
so I,

395
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:20,560
I totally envy this,

396
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:22,210
this approach that you have,

397
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:23,800
but for a variety of reasons,

398
00:12:23,801 --> 00:12:25,360
I feel like I can't take it in,

399
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:26,231
in my life.

400
00:12:26,231 --> 00:12:26,750
And so it's,

401
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:27,130
it's,

402
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:27,840
uh,

403
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,860
but it is very different.

404
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:31,810
Dictates many choices,

405
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:32,381
you know,

406
00:12:32,381 --> 00:12:33,161
down the line,

407
00:12:33,161 --> 00:12:33,994
which I'm,

408
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:35,523
uh,

409
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:36,450
I mean there's,

410
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:37,151
there's a positive,

411
00:12:37,151 --> 00:12:37,601
a negative,

412
00:12:37,601 --> 00:12:38,080
but it's,

413
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:38,290
you know,

414
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:43,290
the positive is what you hear is what we
got and we're done after we turn these

415
00:12:43,631 --> 00:12:44,200
mics off.

416
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:44,790
And that's,

417
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:45,623
and that's not,

418
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:46,840
that's not how I podcast.

419
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:48,420
There's also the visual element of it.

420
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:52,320
And the visual element of it in
initially was almost like a side effect.

421
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:52,621
I mean,

422
00:12:52,621 --> 00:12:52,940
we,

423
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:55,080
we first started it out visually,

424
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:57,030
but then when it started going to itunes,

425
00:12:57,031 --> 00:12:59,580
the itunes aspect of it became the focus,

426
00:12:59,581 --> 00:13:02,190
the audio version of it
rather became the focus,

427
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:06,570
but then we decided to stream on
youtube and put it up on youtube,

428
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,120
but it was totally not profitable.

429
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:09,930
It was just for,

430
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:10,980
for a goof like,

431
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:11,251
oh,

432
00:13:11,251 --> 00:13:12,060
we'll have the video up.

433
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:13,500
Why not some people like video.

434
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:14,580
It was one of those things.

435
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:18,990
But then you realize ultimately that
youtube becomes a viable source of revenue

436
00:13:18,991 --> 00:13:22,470
and then it's also the way a
lot of people like to watch it,

437
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:23,390
you know,

438
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:26,190
and they also like to watch it
because they can comment under it.

439
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,500
So that was the other thing that
came out of the Jack podcast.

440
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:33,500
We got into a controversy about comments
and about how comments are deleted or

441
00:13:34,321 --> 00:13:39,210
how they're shown and hidden and what
happens because people were accusing Jamie

442
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:43,950
of deleting all the derogatory
comments that we don't touch any.

443
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:44,640
We don't,

444
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:45,810
we don't delete any of them.

445
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:47,310
We don't do anything to them.

446
00:13:47,311 --> 00:13:50,340
We just leave them up there
and it's mostly a cesspool.

447
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,750
But I mean,

448
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:53,550
even even on a good podcasts,

449
00:13:53,551 --> 00:13:55,500
there's a lot of crazy shit
that happens on these things,

450
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,420
but from what we think,

451
00:13:57,421 --> 00:13:58,620
and Jamie correct me if I'm wrong,

452
00:13:58,621 --> 00:14:02,340
you think that what's going on is that
people are marketing other people's posts

453
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:03,170
as spam.

454
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:03,840
Yeah.

455
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:04,650
There's that.

456
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:09,510
And then brandon also has a theory that
a lot of all right people are targeted

457
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:12,510
by the algorithm that youtube uses.

458
00:14:12,511 --> 00:14:16,260
Like in one case there was a guy
who had a pepe the frog Avatar,

459
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,570
and he said like his.

460
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:22,590
His comment immediately went to spam
and that the other thing is that the

461
00:14:22,711 --> 00:14:27,711
comments are curated depending upon who
is watching it and what account it'll

462
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:28,050
be,

463
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:30,000
there'll be different sort of,

464
00:14:30,001 --> 00:14:30,181
yeah,

465
00:14:30,181 --> 00:14:32,370
that they'll propagate
different comments to the top.

466
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:33,650
It's not a this.

467
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,250
You can actually change it if you,

468
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:39,840
if you prefer to see the most new comment
from your own personal youtube when

469
00:14:39,841 --> 00:14:40,601
you're watching you,

470
00:14:40,601 --> 00:14:44,250
you as a viewer or a user of
Youtube have to make that actual.

471
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:44,820
Yeah.

472
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:45,390
So that,

473
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:48,150
that conspiracy theory just
heightened the whole thing.

474
00:14:48,151 --> 00:14:48,331
Right.

475
00:14:48,331 --> 00:14:48,601
Okay.

476
00:14:48,601 --> 00:14:50,370
Now they're deleting
negative comments like,

477
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:50,960
look,

478
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,730
I don't like doing bad podcast,

479
00:14:52,731 --> 00:14:55,790
but I will be the first one to tell
you when I think a podcast sucked.

480
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:58,640
That podcast was definitely disappointing.

481
00:14:58,641 --> 00:14:59,390
It wasn't good.

482
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:00,051
Mine wasn't good.

483
00:15:00,051 --> 00:15:00,950
It was like I said,

484
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:01,581
when I listened to it,

485
00:15:01,581 --> 00:15:01,810
I was like,

486
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:01,960
Kinda,

487
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:02,793
this is kind of boring.

488
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:04,383
Just wasn't,

489
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:05,360
wasn't juicy.

490
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:05,850
There was nothing.

491
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:08,240
He didn't get a flow.

492
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:10,700
It wasn't like he and I
were just shooting the shit.

493
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:11,080
Having a good

494
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,970
time to take that one decision.

495
00:15:12,971 --> 00:15:15,340
Say you have decided to make video,

496
00:15:15,341 --> 00:15:19,510
a main component of this podcast are
still probably a small percentage of your

497
00:15:19,511 --> 00:15:21,190
actual listens you're out anymore.

498
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,270
When it was not anymore.

499
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:23,380
It's gotten to.

500
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:27,370
It's almost 50 slash 50 because they're
closing in on the used to be like 90

501
00:15:27,371 --> 00:15:27,740
slash 10,

502
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:27,920
right?

503
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:28,290
Yeah.

504
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:29,123
Yeah.

505
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:30,041
So I have it.

506
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:33,010
I don't have a video component and
so I just put audio on Youtube,

507
00:15:33,011 --> 00:15:35,250
but I put absolutely
no energy into youtube.

508
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:35,820
Uh,

509
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,180
I mean that may one day change,

510
00:15:37,181 --> 00:15:38,950
but because I don't,

511
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:40,900
I don't care what's happening on Youtube.

512
00:15:40,901 --> 00:15:41,081
Right?

513
00:15:41,081 --> 00:15:44,410
So I never see the comments
and whenever I look it is,

514
00:15:44,411 --> 00:15:44,801
as you say,

515
00:15:44,801 --> 00:15:45,311
assessable,

516
00:15:45,311 --> 00:15:45,821
it's insane.

517
00:15:45,821 --> 00:15:48,190
I mean youtube is just skews massively,

518
00:15:48,191 --> 00:15:48,640
right?

519
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:53,640
It skews just massively male and
it's probably skews very young too.

520
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:59,080
So you have it just like
millennial alt right.

521
00:15:59,080 --> 00:15:59,771
Craziness,

522
00:15:59,771 --> 00:15:59,891
right?

523
00:15:59,891 --> 00:16:00,031
It's like,

524
00:16:00,031 --> 00:16:00,761
like as I say,

525
00:16:00,761 --> 00:16:01,391
these sentences,

526
00:16:01,391 --> 00:16:03,940
your youtube pages just
blowing up with hate for me.

527
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,970
You've got a bunch of
millennials with a thumbs up.

528
00:16:06,971 --> 00:16:07,890
Their ass is just wind,

529
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:08,880
you know,

530
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,060
the older people too.

531
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:10,381
Well,

532
00:16:10,381 --> 00:16:10,650
yeah.

533
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:13,920
But I mean it's got to be
younger than most of of where.

534
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:18,310
Well first of all I'm not even seen
most common threads they could possibly

535
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:19,840
respond to anything I put out there now.

536
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:20,051
Right.

537
00:16:20,051 --> 00:16:20,411
So I got to,

538
00:16:20,411 --> 00:16:22,540
I don't even look at my app
mentions for the most part.

539
00:16:22,541 --> 00:16:24,520
I spend maybe five minutes
a day looking at it.

540
00:16:24,521 --> 00:16:25,930
That's healthy was coming back to me.

541
00:16:25,931 --> 00:16:26,080
But.

542
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:29,620
And you were actually helpful
and reformatted my brain on that,

543
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:30,311
on that topic.

544
00:16:30,311 --> 00:16:31,250
But um,

545
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:34,300
so because I don't see any of that stuff,

546
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:38,050
I mean maybe I'm getting a lot of pain
for my Dorsey interview but I don't even

547
00:16:38,051 --> 00:16:38,680
know about it.

548
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:39,070
Right.

549
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:40,930
And so I'm not having,

550
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:41,540
um,

551
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:45,670
I don't feel like I have to course
correct in response to anything now and in

552
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:49,660
large measure it is a consequence
of justice decision that,

553
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:50,230
you know,

554
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:51,700
I inadvertently made that I'm just,

555
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,220
I don't have a video component
to my podcast at the moment.

556
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:55,054
And so I'm not,

557
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,680
I'm not spectating on,

558
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:57,050
you know,

559
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:58,270
the feedback on Youtube.

560
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:01,680
Well the feedback thing is interesting
because we were just talking about this

561
00:17:01,681 --> 00:17:06,570
before the show that with feedback and
comments on Youtube essentially anyone

562
00:17:06,571 --> 00:17:09,450
can comment and if you don't go
banning people from the channel,

563
00:17:09,451 --> 00:17:10,284
which we don't do,

564
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:15,320
it's not what we wouldn't do if someone
was totally a piece of shit but we

565
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:15,870
don't.

566
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:19,260
So you essentially have this open forum,

567
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:22,380
so it's like almost like a message board
where people could just sort of comment

568
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:25,470
and it's unlike twitter in that
regard because twitter just,

569
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,161
you know,

570
00:17:26,161 --> 00:17:27,900
you get abusive and Shitty on twitter,

571
00:17:27,901 --> 00:17:28,740
they just get rid of you.

572
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:31,830
If you get abusive and Shitty
on instagram or on facebook,

573
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:32,641
facebook,

574
00:17:32,641 --> 00:17:33,474
they'll just get rid of you.

575
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:37,500
But if you're on youtube and
you're in those comments,

576
00:17:37,501 --> 00:17:39,090
you could kind of get away with more.

577
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:43,750
So I would imagine that people that don't
appreciate censorship and want to just

578
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:46,680
just fucking spew out
whatever's on their mind,

579
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:48,150
that would be the place
that they would go.

580
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:49,140
Especially if it's the same.

581
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:50,490
Essentially.

582
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:51,301
The only thing different,

583
00:17:51,301 --> 00:17:54,270
and this is the thing where
it got confusing with the
youtube people versus the

584
00:17:54,271 --> 00:17:56,280
audio people with the audio people.

585
00:17:56,281 --> 00:17:58,770
It's very obvious that
the cash app as a sponsor,

586
00:17:58,771 --> 00:18:00,150
because it's we say it,

587
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:02,250
this podcast is brought
to you by the cash app.

588
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:03,630
Whereas in Youtube they like,

589
00:18:03,631 --> 00:18:03,901
ah,

590
00:18:03,901 --> 00:18:05,660
they're hiding the fact
that the cash apps,

591
00:18:05,661 --> 00:18:06,494
a sponsor.

592
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,090
We talked about it during
the podcast itself,

593
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:12,900
but we don't put the ads on Youtube.

594
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:13,710
We,

595
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:15,690
there's ads that youtube puts on,

596
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:19,770
but we put the ads on like after the
show is over I'll read the ads and we'll

597
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:24,240
insert those into the audio and that will
go up to itunes and rss feeds and all

598
00:18:24,241 --> 00:18:24,930
that stuff.

599
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:26,910
So the stuff that's on youtube,

600
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:30,660
it's abbreviated in the sense that
especially the live one doesn't have

601
00:18:30,661 --> 00:18:31,110
anything.

602
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:35,130
So like this has zero ads and then the
ones that will be posted on youtube

603
00:18:35,131 --> 00:18:35,491
later,

604
00:18:35,491 --> 00:18:36,630
a little bit of Youtube ads.

605
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,260
Right.

606
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:38,120
So that's why this.

607
00:18:38,121 --> 00:18:40,560
So there was a couple of
conspiracy theories in that regard.

608
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:44,340
There's also apparently an emerging
conspiracy theory about that.

609
00:18:44,341 --> 00:18:49,060
Jack was trying to pump up bitcoin
because they have some sort of a bitcoin

610
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:49,943
deal.

611
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:51,293
Have you heard this one?

612
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,081
I read that,

613
00:18:52,081 --> 00:18:56,160
but from what I saw it's not
higher than it was at any point.

614
00:18:56,161 --> 00:18:57,870
It's still right around $3,500.

615
00:18:57,871 --> 00:19:02,860
So if there was a pump and dump scheme
of some sort then like it should be like

616
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:04,350
provable on a blockchain I guess.

617
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:04,830
I don't know.

618
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:05,071
Yeah,

619
00:19:05,071 --> 00:19:05,970
I don't understand that,

620
00:19:05,971 --> 00:19:07,710
but is there any other component to it?

621
00:19:07,711 --> 00:19:08,071
I don't know.

622
00:19:08,071 --> 00:19:08,491
I don't know.

623
00:19:08,491 --> 00:19:09,550
I don't know where that was coming from.

624
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:14,620
This don't even know what did it all he
said was that will the cash app sells

625
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,310
bitcoins.

626
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:16,143
We talked about

627
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:17,103
coin.

628
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:19,700
You can buy and sell bitcoin
through the cash app,

629
00:19:19,701 --> 00:19:20,300
I should say.

630
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:22,280
I think he said something
about blockchain technology,

631
00:19:22,281 --> 00:19:24,690
rendering everything
permanent online and that was.

632
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:25,830
That was something different though.

633
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:26,210
Yeah,

634
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:26,621
but that,

635
00:19:26,621 --> 00:19:30,290
that I think that's in regard
to comments into anything.

636
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,280
Blog posts,

637
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:34,970
blockchain is essentially going to
have everything that's online forever,

638
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:39,620
but there's so many fucking conspiracy
theories about all this stuff.

639
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:40,190
It's,

640
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:41,270
it's fascinating.

641
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:42,870
And as you know,

642
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:44,810
we were talking about earlier with your,

643
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:46,400
the way you do yours,

644
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:51,500
you used to use patrion and now you use
your own website after the Sargon of a

645
00:19:51,501 --> 00:19:52,400
cod incident,

646
00:19:52,401 --> 00:19:52,660
which,

647
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:53,241
you know,

648
00:19:53,241 --> 00:19:54,540
beliefs stepped back away from

649
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:56,290
patrion now or not.

650
00:19:56,291 --> 00:19:58,890
So no blade depending on what
you think of Oregon to pick out.

651
00:19:58,891 --> 00:19:59,100
Yeah.

652
00:19:59,100 --> 00:19:59,240
Yeah.

653
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,220
Well it's not even that.

654
00:20:00,221 --> 00:20:00,890
It's.

655
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:01,400
Yeah.

656
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,170
Yeah.

657
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:02,990
Well,

658
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:07,990
there's so many misconceptions about
what happened there and I tried to clear

659
00:20:08,651 --> 00:20:10,210
them up on my podcast,

660
00:20:10,211 --> 00:20:11,290
but yeah,

661
00:20:11,291 --> 00:20:14,320
there's an interesting
implication to not taking ads.

662
00:20:14,321 --> 00:20:14,441
I mean,

663
00:20:14,441 --> 00:20:14,590
I,

664
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:15,850
I think what's happening,

665
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,950
and this is much bigger
than even podcasting,

666
00:20:17,951 --> 00:20:18,784
I think

667
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:21,670
I'd be interested to know
what you feel about this.

668
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:22,600
You have,

669
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:27,600
you are the quintessence of
the successful ad model in,

670
00:20:27,801 --> 00:20:28,521
in podcasting,

671
00:20:28,521 --> 00:20:28,650
right?

672
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:30,460
It's like this is you.

673
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:33,070
It's working fantastically well for you.

674
00:20:33,071 --> 00:20:36,790
And for people like Tim Ferriss
and probably Mark Marin.

675
00:20:36,791 --> 00:20:37,610
I mean there's this,

676
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:41,050
there's some kind of like a winner take
all thing happening in this space where

677
00:20:41,051 --> 00:20:46,051
ads are working great and I am a really
also a highly successful example of the

678
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:51,723
support model.

679
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:56,470
It's like the pbs model or the NPR
model and what's weird is that I can't,

680
00:20:56,471 --> 00:20:56,981
like we,

681
00:20:56,981 --> 00:20:57,370
you know,

682
00:20:57,370 --> 00:21:00,410
you and I are both surrounded
by people who have podcasts,

683
00:21:00,411 --> 00:21:03,880
want to have podcasts and are asking us
for advice about how to succeed and how

684
00:21:03,881 --> 00:21:04,714
to monetize.

685
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:10,170
And like I'm not even in a place where
I can recommend my model to anyone else.

686
00:21:10,961 --> 00:21:11,201
Right?

687
00:21:11,201 --> 00:21:11,620
Because it's,

688
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:12,453
it's a very,

689
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,380
it's very hit or miss.

690
00:21:14,381 --> 00:21:17,620
I mean I had just happened to have
developed an audience that will support my

691
00:21:17,621 --> 00:21:19,900
work and you had developed
that audience previously,

692
00:21:19,901 --> 00:21:21,310
ironically enough on youtube,

693
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:26,530
there's a lot of youtube debates and
random people calling people putting my

694
00:21:26,531 --> 00:21:27,820
content on their youtube channels,

695
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:30,220
but they're mostly debates,

696
00:21:30,221 --> 00:21:30,630
right?

697
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:31,170
Yeah.

698
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:31,690
And as a,

699
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:31,931
you know,

700
00:21:31,931 --> 00:21:32,591
as an author,

701
00:21:32,591 --> 00:21:37,591
but it was just a podcast grew and I had
this sort of for forest choice where am

702
00:21:39,161 --> 00:21:39,690
I going to go the,

703
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:39,940
the,

704
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:41,230
the ad route or,

705
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:42,123
or not.

706
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:46,390
And I found that I may have two things to,

707
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:48,081
to say,

708
00:21:48,081 --> 00:21:48,251
you know,

709
00:21:48,251 --> 00:21:49,660
fairly strongly against ads,

710
00:21:49,661 --> 00:21:53,620
but really only one of them applies to
me and I don't think it applies to you or

711
00:21:53,621 --> 00:21:54,221
tim or,

712
00:21:54,221 --> 00:21:55,120
or anyone else.

713
00:21:55,610 --> 00:21:55,821
Um,

714
00:21:55,821 --> 00:22:00,821
I just felt personally I couldn't use ads
because of sort of what my platform is

715
00:22:01,511 --> 00:22:05,170
and the kinds of topics I'm
engaging and it just didn't work.

716
00:22:05,171 --> 00:22:10,171
I mean there was nothing high brow
enough where I felt like my credibility

717
00:22:11,441 --> 00:22:13,090
wasn't getting subtly undermine.

718
00:22:13,091 --> 00:22:13,571
Bye Bye.

719
00:22:13,571 --> 00:22:14,201
Shilling for it.

720
00:22:14,201 --> 00:22:14,321
I mean,

721
00:22:14,321 --> 00:22:17,230
it could be something that I just legit
loved and it could've been the Oxford

722
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:17,681
English dictionary,

723
00:22:17,681 --> 00:22:17,921
you know,

724
00:22:17,921 --> 00:22:20,440
like you guys is the best
engineer in the world.

725
00:22:20,441 --> 00:22:21,274
You guys should use it.

726
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:26,080
I still couldn't do it and I tried it
with the only thing I took on as a sponsor

727
00:22:26,081 --> 00:22:26,740
was audible.

728
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:28,450
And I did that for some
weeks and then it just,

729
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:29,110
you know,

730
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:29,943
I love audible but,

731
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:30,410
but it,

732
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:31,180
it just felt wrong.

733
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:36,180
And so I decided to just experiment
with a different business model and it's

734
00:22:36,941 --> 00:22:38,050
working for me,

735
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,310
but it's,

736
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:43,330
I don't think it can work for most
people and I view that as a problem.

737
00:22:43,331 --> 00:22:43,481
And uh,

738
00:22:43,481 --> 00:22:43,670
and,

739
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:48,670
and the thing that I think is interesting
is that this is much bigger than

740
00:22:49,091 --> 00:22:49,471
podcasts.

741
00:22:49,471 --> 00:22:50,171
And so you have,

742
00:22:50,171 --> 00:22:53,470
like you have facebook on the one hand,

743
00:22:53,471 --> 00:22:55,450
which is just a,

744
00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:57,670
a totally free platform.

745
00:22:57,671 --> 00:23:01,930
Where were the users don't even realize
that they're not the customers there at

746
00:23:01,931 --> 00:23:02,920
the actual product,

747
00:23:02,921 --> 00:23:03,131
right?

748
00:23:03,131 --> 00:23:08,131
They use as the users are having their
attention sold to advertisers and it's

749
00:23:08,831 --> 00:23:09,820
this enormous business.

750
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:11,920
And on the other end of
the digital spectrum,

751
00:23:11,921 --> 00:23:13,270
you have Netflix,

752
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:15,280
which is just a stark paywall,

753
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:15,640
right?

754
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:20,380
And there's no way in but to pay
the subscription and you know,

755
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:20,890
that's,

756
00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:24,490
and Netflix could run ads and
get more money if they wanted to,

757
00:23:24,491 --> 00:23:25,520
but they're not,

758
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:28,090
they're not doing that and
presumably won't do that.

759
00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:33,280
And I'm hoping just generally speaking
that the digital future looks much more

760
00:23:33,281 --> 00:23:35,590
like Netflix and much less like facebook.

761
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:41,160
And because I see what ads has ads have
done is they've anchored everyone to the

762
00:23:42,221 --> 00:23:43,420
illusion of free.

763
00:23:43,421 --> 00:23:48,421
Everyone expects their digital content
for free except in places like Netflix.

764
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:48,891
Right?

765
00:23:48,891 --> 00:23:50,870
So like if when you
release a comedy special,

766
00:23:50,871 --> 00:23:54,770
when you release your next hour
and you sell it to Netflix,

767
00:23:55,370 --> 00:23:57,460
I would imagine there
are very few people in,

768
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,480
in your fan base who are thinking,

769
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:00,830
well fuck Joe Rogan,

770
00:24:00,831 --> 00:24:02,420
why didn't he just put
that out on Youtube?

771
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:02,841
Right?

772
00:24:02,841 --> 00:24:03,980
Why is this on Netflix?

773
00:24:03,981 --> 00:24:04,121
They,

774
00:24:04,121 --> 00:24:07,640
they sort of understand that
this piece of content is,

775
00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:10,010
belongs on that shelf
and that if they want it,

776
00:24:10,011 --> 00:24:11,540
they have to subscribe to Netflix.

777
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:16,070
Whereas if you did something
slightly different,

778
00:24:16,071 --> 00:24:17,330
but functionally the same,

779
00:24:17,331 --> 00:24:21,860
if you put it on Vimeo and charge people
$5 or whatever in a vimeo on demand,

780
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,233
um,

781
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:23,570
you,

782
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:24,740
I think you'd get a lot more pain,

783
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:25,040
right?

784
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:25,280
You know,

785
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:25,881
people would say,

786
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:26,481
well fuck you,

787
00:24:26,481 --> 00:24:27,530
you greedy bastard like you've,

788
00:24:27,531 --> 00:24:28,610
you're already doing great.

789
00:24:28,611 --> 00:24:29,900
Just release your stuff.

790
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:30,111
Right?

791
00:24:30,111 --> 00:24:30,770
Yeah.

792
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:34,310
And I view that as a problem as like,

793
00:24:34,311 --> 00:24:35,600
it's like a psychological problem.

794
00:24:35,601 --> 00:24:39,830
People have been anchored
to the ad subsidized model
more or less everywhere and

795
00:24:39,831 --> 00:24:41,600
they expect everything for free.

796
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:47,110
And in my world I'm trying
to just continually brook
that expectation and push

797
00:24:49,881 --> 00:24:54,380
people into a different sense
of you get what you pay for and,

798
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:59,410
and the so that the hybrid model I've
created for myself is I'm putting more

799
00:24:59,781 --> 00:25:00,830
stuff behind a paywall,

800
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:01,281
right?

801
00:25:01,281 --> 00:25:01,520
I mean,

802
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:06,170
so that this is not just pure
sponsorship of otherwise free content,

803
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:07,860
but I'm,

804
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:08,900
I'm very personally,

805
00:25:08,901 --> 00:25:12,410
I'm very uncomfortable with the idea
that if someone actually can't afford it,

806
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:14,450
they can't get access to my content.

807
00:25:14,451 --> 00:25:15,620
So I just tell people,

808
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:19,460
if you really can't afford the stuff
behind the pay wall or you really can't

809
00:25:19,461 --> 00:25:20,660
afford my meditation APP,

810
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:23,090
just send us an email and
we'll give it to you for free.

811
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:23,541
Right.

812
00:25:23,541 --> 00:25:24,650
So I've heard that.

813
00:25:24,651 --> 00:25:25,010
I was like,

814
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:25,880
this guy's crazy.

815
00:25:25,881 --> 00:25:26,630
I mean it's actually,

816
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:28,190
it's actually in the pricing,

817
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:30,110
in the APP store for my meditation APP.

818
00:25:30,111 --> 00:25:32,510
It's like there's the pricing
and then below that there's,

819
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:34,040
if you can't afford this,

820
00:25:34,041 --> 00:25:34,340
you know,

821
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:34,761
here's the,

822
00:25:34,761 --> 00:25:35,594
here's the email address.

823
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,860
I think that's fantastic.

824
00:25:36,890 --> 00:25:37,723
And so that's,

825
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:38,270
yeah,

826
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:39,260
I'm splitting it that way,

827
00:25:39,261 --> 00:25:41,780
but I'm raising prices.

828
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:42,560
So it's like,

829
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:43,393
it's like,

830
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,670
because I think everything
is too cheap in the,

831
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:46,970
in the digital space I think.

832
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:48,500
I think we're anchored to.

833
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:53,880
I mean there are people who will spend
$5 a day on a cup of coffee everyday for

834
00:25:54,471 --> 00:25:59,471
the rest of their lives and he had a few
told them this podcast or this app that

835
00:26:00,111 --> 00:26:00,440
they,

836
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:05,270
that they say is incredibly valuable to
them is going to cost them $5 a month.

837
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:06,320
They,

838
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,310
they feel raped.

839
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:07,701
Right.

840
00:26:07,701 --> 00:26:07,911
You know,

841
00:26:07,911 --> 00:26:08,744
so it's,

842
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:09,300
you know,

843
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:13,340
and I completely understand it because
I know what it's like to hit a pay wall

844
00:26:13,341 --> 00:26:15,830
and think I can't get my
credit card out again.

845
00:26:15,831 --> 00:26:16,970
I'm not going to pay for this.

846
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:18,950
I'm going to find this
information somewhere else.

847
00:26:18,951 --> 00:26:22,700
So we've all been anchored
to this thing and you know,

848
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,460
something is going to win in the end.

849
00:26:25,461 --> 00:26:25,641
I mean,

850
00:26:25,641 --> 00:26:25,701
I,

851
00:26:25,701 --> 00:26:25,911
you know,

852
00:26:25,911 --> 00:26:27,200
I think at some point,

853
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:32,440
you know it's going to look much more
like Netflix or much more like a facebook

854
00:26:33,231 --> 00:26:33,421
and I'm,

855
00:26:33,421 --> 00:26:33,790
I'm,

856
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:34,041
I'm,

857
00:26:34,041 --> 00:26:34,191
you know,

858
00:26:34,191 --> 00:26:35,870
I'm throwing my lot in with the former,

859
00:26:35,871 --> 00:26:37,760
but it really is the wild west.

860
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:38,001
Well,

861
00:26:38,001 --> 00:26:41,930
the Netflix things different because
Netflix has programs that cost a lot of

862
00:26:41,931 --> 00:26:42,764
money to create.

863
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,040
This podcast is very

864
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:44,341
easy.

865
00:26:44,341 --> 00:26:44,881
You're my friend.

866
00:26:44,881 --> 00:26:45,391
I call you up,

867
00:26:45,391 --> 00:26:45,541
hey,

868
00:26:45,541 --> 00:26:46,341
you want to do a podcast?

869
00:26:46,341 --> 00:26:47,174
You coming over here.

870
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:48,930
I mean obviously we had to
pay for all this equipment,

871
00:26:48,931 --> 00:26:52,860
but other than that it's just
bandwidth and rent and all that stuff.

872
00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:53,371
Other than that,

873
00:26:53,371 --> 00:26:54,204
it just goes up.

874
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,540
Whereas you do a comedy special across
hundreds of thousands of dollars.

875
00:26:57,541 --> 00:26:58,740
You have to secure a venue,

876
00:26:58,741 --> 00:26:59,940
you have to hire staff.

877
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:01,320
I mean it's a big deal.

878
00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:02,520
That's an.

879
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:05,880
That's an easy thing in terms
of like bang for their buck,

880
00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:07,620
what Netflix will get out of it.

881
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:10,050
If you do a television show,

882
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:10,980
I mean my God,

883
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:11,450
you,

884
00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:13,530
you need to hire hundreds of people.

885
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:18,420
There's wardrobe and makeup and set
and there's writers and producers and

886
00:27:18,421 --> 00:27:21,000
executives and everybody has to go
over the script with a fine tooth comb.

887
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:22,320
It's incredibly,

888
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:23,610
incredibly strenuous.

889
00:27:23,611 --> 00:27:27,000
There's a lot going on when you create
a television like stranger things or

890
00:27:27,001 --> 00:27:27,571
something like that.

891
00:27:27,571 --> 00:27:32,000
I mean you have so much special effects
and so to ask for that for free seems to

892
00:27:32,001 --> 00:27:33,930
be to me seems ridiculous.

893
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:35,370
Well yeah,

894
00:27:35,371 --> 00:27:35,601
but,

895
00:27:35,601 --> 00:27:37,260
but except I mean,

896
00:27:37,261 --> 00:27:38,400
so I'm kind of split.

897
00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:38,731
Again,

898
00:27:38,731 --> 00:27:39,930
I'm running on two tracks here.

899
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:42,450
An APP is much more
like a television show.

900
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,880
Surprisingly that than
it is like a podcast.

901
00:27:44,881 --> 00:27:45,420
But yes,

902
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:47,400
but even if it's just a podcast,

903
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:49,680
if you want to build something,

904
00:27:49,681 --> 00:27:51,420
if you want to build a media company like,

905
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:51,810
like,

906
00:27:51,810 --> 00:27:53,010
like let's say you were,

907
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:56,660
let's say you were asking for support
for this otherwise free pod podcast.

908
00:27:58,290 --> 00:28:00,210
People don't know what
your aspirations are.

909
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:02,220
I mean maybe you want to
start a podcast network,

910
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:02,431
right?

911
00:28:02,431 --> 00:28:03,060
Maybe you have,

912
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:07,080
you're trying to build a business that
is that maybe you have massive payroll

913
00:28:07,081 --> 00:28:09,900
expenses that you,

914
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:10,551
you know,

915
00:28:10,551 --> 00:28:15,551
so the expectation that the products
should always be free closes the door to

916
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:19,880
any of those aspirations if in
fact you have them and you know,

917
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:20,520
it's like,

918
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,353
um,

919
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:24,270
I mean it is very interesting
psychologically because.

920
00:28:24,290 --> 00:28:24,591
So I,

921
00:28:24,591 --> 00:28:24,991
so I have,

922
00:28:24,991 --> 00:28:27,450
I've created this network
of support for my podcast,

923
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:33,080
but I see people do calculations
that they would never do in a more

924
00:28:34,321 --> 00:28:35,840
transactional space that
they were just like,

925
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,320
let's say buying my next book.

926
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:37,591
Right?

927
00:28:37,591 --> 00:28:38,424
So like,

928
00:28:38,530 --> 00:28:38,940
um,

929
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:43,940
for me offering a free podcast and
then saying if you find this valuable,

930
00:28:44,881 --> 00:28:45,780
you can support it,

931
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:46,680
right?

932
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,513
That,

933
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:47,960
you know,

934
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,950
from the side of being a
creator of that content,

935
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:55,430
it feels like the most transparent
interaction possible because a person can

936
00:28:55,861 --> 00:28:59,490
listen for free for as long as they want
to just discover how valuable that is

937
00:28:59,491 --> 00:29:02,340
and then they can support it to the
degree that they find it valuable.

938
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:04,200
Whereas if I'm selling you a book,

939
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:08,130
you can't even read the book before you
before you buy it or you have to make

940
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,780
the decision to buy it.

941
00:29:09,781 --> 00:29:12,510
And I'm trying to convince you to buy
it because it took me all this time to

942
00:29:12,511 --> 00:29:12,930
write it.

943
00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:13,260
And,

944
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:14,093
and uh,

945
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:14,761
you know,

946
00:29:14,761 --> 00:29:15,060
you're,

947
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:15,670
you know,

948
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:16,000
it's,

949
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,100
it's transactional.

950
00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:19,560
I'm with,

951
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:20,970
but with a podcast,

952
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:26,030
people make calculations that they would
never make when they're just figuring

953
00:29:26,191 --> 00:29:27,550
out whether they want to
buy something that's like,

954
00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:30,960
like I'll really along the lines
of what you just described.

955
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:31,861
People say,

956
00:29:31,861 --> 00:29:32,694
well,

957
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,950
how much has the podcast costs to produce?

958
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:35,341
Right?

959
00:29:35,341 --> 00:29:35,500
Like,

960
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:39,930
like if I knew what you were spending
the money on and what it costs you to do

961
00:29:39,931 --> 00:29:42,070
this podcast will then
I would support you.

962
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:42,431
Right?

963
00:29:42,431 --> 00:29:47,110
But they're never saying how much does
it cost to write a book and if I knew

964
00:29:47,111 --> 00:29:49,240
what you were going to
spend the money on once you,

965
00:29:49,241 --> 00:29:50,600
once you were once,

966
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,700
once I bought this book,

967
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:53,800
then I would know whether
or not I wanted to buy.

968
00:29:53,801 --> 00:29:55,180
They either want the book or you don't.

969
00:29:55,181 --> 00:29:55,361
Right.

970
00:29:55,361 --> 00:29:57,670
So the problem with the support model,

971
00:29:57,671 --> 00:30:00,160
and that's the problem with
Patriot and everything else,

972
00:30:00,161 --> 00:30:02,030
is that it engages the,

973
00:30:02,031 --> 00:30:04,900
sort of the philanthropy
charity side of the brain,

974
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:05,230
right?

975
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:08,830
And people are worried about what
you're going to do and how much it,

976
00:30:08,831 --> 00:30:09,281
all costs.

977
00:30:09,281 --> 00:30:10,480
Like how much does it cost?

978
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:10,930
Right.

979
00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:11,340
Like that.

980
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:11,890
That's,

981
00:30:11,890 --> 00:30:14,410
that's a question that someone
is asking when they're donating.

982
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:15,400
It wasn't been donating.

983
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:19,390
And the problem there is
they're not understanding,

984
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:20,823
you know,

985
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:22,240
just the opportunity costs.

986
00:30:22,241 --> 00:30:22,481
Like I,

987
00:30:22,481 --> 00:30:22,691
you know,

988
00:30:22,691 --> 00:30:24,280
I have to decide how to spend my time,

989
00:30:24,281 --> 00:30:27,460
am I going to spend 90 percent of
my time on a podcast will that,

990
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:28,181
if.

991
00:30:28,181 --> 00:30:29,014
So,

992
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:30,650
that closes the door to,

993
00:30:30,810 --> 00:30:32,920
to virtually everything else I can do.

994
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:33,221
Right.

995
00:30:33,221 --> 00:30:33,630
So it's,

996
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:33,831
you know,

997
00:30:33,831 --> 00:30:33,970
it's,

998
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:35,650
it has to become a viable business.

999
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:36,761
And so,

1000
00:30:36,761 --> 00:30:36,971
I mean,

1001
00:30:36,971 --> 00:30:37,081
I,

1002
00:30:37,081 --> 00:30:39,580
I've recognized now that I am,

1003
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:40,810
you know,

1004
00:30:40,810 --> 00:30:45,310
to some degree going against the grain
of human psychology in asking for support

1005
00:30:45,311 --> 00:30:45,940
and now I,

1006
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:48,430
now I feel like I'm
going to ask much less,

1007
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:51,130
I'm going to tell people what the
business model is and you know,

1008
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,720
instilling and remind them of it,

1009
00:30:52,721 --> 00:30:54,970
but I'm personally,

1010
00:30:54,971 --> 00:30:59,170
I'm going to go more and
more in the direction of
putting stuff behind a paywall

1011
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,870
and if people want it
then they can support.

1012
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:02,990
And so it's,

1013
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,320
it's kind of sort of Netflix,

1014
00:31:05,321 --> 00:31:10,321
the ultimate version of it would be if
it were Netflix that would also let you

1015
00:31:10,391 --> 00:31:11,980
get it for free if you
really couldn't afford it.

1016
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:13,573
I mean that,

1017
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:17,260
that's the guilt free business
model that I'm converging on that.

1018
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,000
I like it.

1019
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,960
I like how you're thinking and I'd like
the ethics involved in it and I think

1020
00:31:21,961 --> 00:31:22,651
it's a great thing.

1021
00:31:22,651 --> 00:31:24,030
And when you set it on your podcast,

1022
00:31:24,031 --> 00:31:24,691
I was shocked,

1023
00:31:24,691 --> 00:31:26,010
but it makes sense coming from you.

1024
00:31:26,370 --> 00:31:27,000
Um,

1025
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,080
my thought is I'm in negotiation
or in discussions right now,

1026
00:31:31,081 --> 00:31:32,280
and I talked to you about this too,

1027
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:37,340
about building an APP and what I want to
do with the APP is have a set amount of

1028
00:31:37,531 --> 00:31:42,120
money that you pay per month if you want
to sign up for the APP and you get the

1029
00:31:42,121 --> 00:31:43,620
podcast with no ads,

1030
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:44,490
right?

1031
00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:48,840
So you could either get it from itunes
or whatever you google play or Google

1032
00:31:48,841 --> 00:31:52,110
podcast or you can get it from the
APP and if you get it from the APP,

1033
00:31:52,111 --> 00:31:56,220
you pay x amount per month and you get
the podcast with zero ads and it'll

1034
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:56,910
stream live.

1035
00:31:56,910 --> 00:31:59,010
I'm going to figure out how
to do both those things.

1036
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:02,910
My thought going into advertising when I,

1037
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:04,200
when I first did the podcast,

1038
00:32:04,201 --> 00:32:05,790
I've been doing the
podcast now for nine years.

1039
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:07,620
When I first started doing it,

1040
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:09,450
there was no ads for the longest time.

1041
00:32:09,451 --> 00:32:10,320
It just costs money.

1042
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:11,670
It costs money to,

1043
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:12,391
for bandwidth,

1044
00:32:12,391 --> 00:32:13,171
it costs money to put it.

1045
00:32:13,171 --> 00:32:14,880
But I was doing it for
fun and I didn't care.

1046
00:32:14,881 --> 00:32:17,220
And I had my revenue was
coming from other sources.

1047
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:18,121
Um,

1048
00:32:18,121 --> 00:32:19,440
a few years ago,

1049
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,020
uh,

1050
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:22,950
I decided what I was going to do was,

1051
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:24,000
because I was getting ad,

1052
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:27,420
the first ad request was the
facebook was the fleshlight rather,

1053
00:32:27,421 --> 00:32:30,870
and you were the first person to
request I killed them to not have the

1054
00:32:30,871 --> 00:32:32,490
flashlight on your podcast.

1055
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:35,010
The first podcast that
we did in Prima Donna

1056
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:37,650
was,

1057
00:32:37,650 --> 00:32:38,490
it made sense.

1058
00:32:38,491 --> 00:32:38,721
I mean,

1059
00:32:38,721 --> 00:32:40,160
they were disgusting adds to.

1060
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:40,370
I mean,

1061
00:32:40,370 --> 00:32:42,110
we would get ridiculous and,

1062
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:44,150
and be really silly and those ads,

1063
00:32:44,151 --> 00:32:45,200
it was just the juxtaposition.

1064
00:32:45,201 --> 00:32:45,470
I just,

1065
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:49,520
just knowing that the Mike would go
hot and then 15 seconds before it would

1066
00:32:49,521 --> 00:32:52,460
still be ringing in their ears if you
want to jack off with this fantastic

1067
00:32:52,461 --> 00:32:53,294
device.

1068
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:54,710
And here's Sam Harris,

1069
00:32:54,711 --> 00:32:55,544
neuroscientists,

1070
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:56,990
but moral philosopher,

1071
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:58,730
the fleshlight experience,

1072
00:32:58,731 --> 00:33:03,080
some pretty significant
positive impact from that.

1073
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:06,770
I mean their business went through
the roof because of the podcast.

1074
00:33:06,771 --> 00:33:07,011
I mean,

1075
00:33:07,011 --> 00:33:10,130
they're really sold a shitload
of flashlights where they
told me that like some

1076
00:33:10,131 --> 00:33:10,881
ungodly number,

1077
00:33:10,881 --> 00:33:14,120
like 50 percent of the flashlights
they were selling was codeword Rogan.

1078
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:18,200
So I don't want a picture too much.

1079
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:20,900
The armies of people using their product,

1080
00:33:20,901 --> 00:33:21,260
you know.

1081
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:26,260
So word got around and then as the
podcast space started expanding,

1082
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,250
then advertisers,

1083
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:33,400
tentatively we're dipping their toe in
my philosophy and it's still holds 2006

1084
00:33:35,091 --> 00:33:35,924
or seven or

1085
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:39,660
2012.

1086
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:43,580
The first time I was on here it was 2011.

1087
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:45,053
Wow.

1088
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,610
Maybe the end of 2009.

1089
00:33:46,611 --> 00:33:48,980
Two thousand 10 was probably on before.

1090
00:33:48,981 --> 00:33:49,281
Yeah.

1091
00:33:49,281 --> 00:33:51,390
You were probably around 2010 or 11.

1092
00:33:51,391 --> 00:33:53,930
There was no other ads other than
the fleshlight though with you.

1093
00:33:54,370 --> 00:33:54,820
Um,

1094
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:57,640
and then the fleshlight dropped off
when we started asking for more money.

1095
00:33:57,641 --> 00:33:57,911
They're like,

1096
00:33:57,911 --> 00:33:58,090
ah,

1097
00:33:58,090 --> 00:33:59,420
I think we hit the point of no return.

1098
00:33:59,810 --> 00:34:03,170
But my philosophy getting
into advertisement was a,

1099
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:08,200
I'm going to do whatever the fuck I want
to do a 100 percent and have no impact

1100
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:13,220
whatsoever on the content of my podcast.

1101
00:34:13,221 --> 00:34:15,410
Like whatever advertisers that I choose,

1102
00:34:15,830 --> 00:34:17,270
whatever advertisers that

1103
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:20,120
make deals with,

1104
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:23,480
they have to understand that there's
no way I'm changing the content of the

1105
00:34:23,481 --> 00:34:26,180
podcast and if I lose them I lose them.

1106
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:27,133
I don't care.

1107
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:29,210
And that was the thought process going in.

1108
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:33,230
So I never hit a snag like this cash app,

1109
00:34:33,231 --> 00:34:38,231
Jack Dorsey thing before where people
think that the reason why I was easy with

1110
00:34:38,241 --> 00:34:41,240
him was because of the fact
that he sponsors the podcasts.

1111
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:42,530
It's a very obvious

1112
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:45,050
conflict of interest,

1113
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:51,020
but people have to realize that if
they churn out off your podcast,

1114
00:34:51,021 --> 00:34:53,400
you've got just an endless
number of advertisers.

1115
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:54,580
There's waiting lines.

1116
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:54,741
Yeah,

1117
00:34:54,741 --> 00:34:57,380
so I mean the cash out logical opponent,

1118
00:34:57,430 --> 00:34:59,810
it's just one way of
looking at it that they.

1119
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:01,400
They buy a lot of ads.

1120
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:02,720
They do buy a lot of ads.

1121
00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:04,160
We do have a good relationship with them,

1122
00:35:04,610 --> 00:35:08,000
but I don't need them if they went away.

1123
00:35:08,001 --> 00:35:11,120
I have too many ads and
that sounds gross to say,

1124
00:35:11,121 --> 00:35:12,170
but it is a fact.

1125
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:15,320
I have many more ads than
I have spots for ads,

1126
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:19,610
so if they went away would not hurt me
at all financially because I put a limit

1127
00:35:19,611 --> 00:35:21,220
on how many ads I do podcasts.

1128
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:24,410
I also don't ever interrupt
a podcast with an ad.

1129
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:26,780
I don't do that because I don't do that.

1130
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:27,613
That cost me money,

1131
00:35:27,830 --> 00:35:32,830
but I just feel like the experience of
listening to a podcast unbroken is so

1132
00:35:33,981 --> 00:35:37,130
much better than listening to a podcast.

1133
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,660
Be Right back with this
word from Casper mattresses.

1134
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:40,151
You know,

1135
00:35:40,151 --> 00:35:42,030
it just feels gross,

1136
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:43,350
but in the beginning I'm like,

1137
00:35:43,351 --> 00:35:43,800
look,

1138
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:44,760
you know where it is.

1139
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:46,080
You can fast forward,

1140
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:47,880
but maybe you're into this stuff.

1141
00:35:47,881 --> 00:35:49,280
Maybe you need stamps.com.

1142
00:35:49,290 --> 00:35:50,580
It may be whatever the fuck you need.

1143
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:51,690
Those are the ads.

1144
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:52,890
They pay a lot of money.

1145
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:55,950
I'm going to take that money and I'm going
to do whatever the fuck I want and if

1146
00:35:55,951 --> 00:35:57,150
these guys decide,

1147
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:57,391
oh,

1148
00:35:57,391 --> 00:35:59,880
you smoke pot or you're too controversial,

1149
00:35:59,881 --> 00:36:01,710
or you talk about this or talk about that,

1150
00:36:01,711 --> 00:36:02,544
we're going to drop you.

1151
00:36:02,850 --> 00:36:03,683
Okay,

1152
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:06,600
that's my philosophy and I've lost ads.

1153
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:07,590
Have lost sponsors.

1154
00:36:08,010 --> 00:36:08,540
Okay,

1155
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:09,350
I don't care,

1156
00:36:09,350 --> 00:36:11,550
but if I lost the cash app
because it was too high,

1157
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:15,810
hard on Jack Dorsey or if Jack Dorsey
comes back and I'm too hard on him in

1158
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,910
grilling him about these
people that have been censored.

1159
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:19,770
I hope it doesn't,

1160
00:36:19,770 --> 00:36:20,640
but I like him.

1161
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:21,390
He's a nice guy.

1162
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:22,770
I want to know what the
fuck's going on there.

1163
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:23,100
I,

1164
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:23,671
in fact,

1165
00:36:23,671 --> 00:36:25,590
I'm having Tim Pool come on tomorrow.

1166
00:36:25,591 --> 00:36:27,150
Tim Pools of investigative journalists,

1167
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:32,360
independent journalist who was used to
be with vice and he knows a lot about the

1168
00:36:33,331 --> 00:36:36,020
censorship issue with youtube or with a,

1169
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,020
with twitter rather.

1170
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,490
And he knows about youtube as well,

1171
00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:39,150
but uh,

1172
00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:41,280
with who is censored and why,

1173
00:36:41,310 --> 00:36:42,180
who is removed,

1174
00:36:42,181 --> 00:36:43,290
who's been deep platform,

1175
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:47,100
why they'd been diy platform and where
the inconsistencies and you know,

1176
00:36:47,101 --> 00:36:47,880
where,

1177
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:48,300
why,

1178
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:50,220
why is it skewing so heavily,

1179
00:36:50,221 --> 00:36:50,850
right?

1180
00:36:50,850 --> 00:36:53,210
Where the people in the right are
the ones who were getting banned.

1181
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:55,200
The people on the left are getting
away with a lot of crazy shit.

1182
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:56,040
So we're going to,

1183
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:59,250
we're going to get into the weeds with
that and if the cash app hears that and

1184
00:36:59,251 --> 00:37:01,290
they decided to drop me as a sponsor,

1185
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:02,333
I don't care.

1186
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:03,630
I really don't care.

1187
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,670
This is a major source of income for me,

1188
00:37:05,671 --> 00:37:09,300
but it's only one source is one of the
things that being a standup comedian

1189
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:13,080
working for the UFC and having a
podcast and I have a podcast with ads on

1190
00:37:13,081 --> 00:37:13,800
youtube.

1191
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:17,670
And and having ads that are
on the regular podcast itself,

1192
00:37:18,090 --> 00:37:20,270
I'm free in a sense too.

1193
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,660
I have plenty of money.

1194
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:25,020
It's not whether or not I'm starving
or worry about paying my bills.

1195
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,450
I'm free to do whatever I want to do.

1196
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:31,200
Well also actually be clear like I don't
think because this can sound totally

1197
00:37:31,201 --> 00:37:33,870
sanctimonious and it's
not intended that way.

1198
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:39,260
I don't think my scruples
around at reading it as on
my podcast apply to you or

1199
00:37:41,821 --> 00:37:44,880
Tim Ferriss or many other people
like tim is the ultimate example.

1200
00:37:44,881 --> 00:37:49,881
Tim is somebody who's brand on some level
is what I'm going to do is I'm going

1201
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:52,290
to go out there and find
the best shit in the world,

1202
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:54,000
the best shirts,

1203
00:37:54,001 --> 00:37:55,410
the best workout equipment that is,

1204
00:37:55,650 --> 00:37:56,670
and I'm going to tell you about it.

1205
00:37:56,830 --> 00:37:58,500
So I want to know what tim has found.

1206
00:37:58,930 --> 00:37:59,190
Tim,

1207
00:37:59,190 --> 00:38:04,190
if tim is reading an ad for something
that is totally brand convergent for him,

1208
00:38:04,351 --> 00:38:07,350
and I think you're very much in a similar
situation if you're talking about on

1209
00:38:07,351 --> 00:38:08,160
it or whatever it is.

1210
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,930
It's your own you own part of on it.

1211
00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:14,370
I should also be clear that I say no
to a lot of ads that I don't want.

1212
00:38:14,371 --> 00:38:15,031
Like there was one,

1213
00:38:15,031 --> 00:38:17,010
there was a uber for babysitting.

1214
00:38:17,370 --> 00:38:17,760
I was like,

1215
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,350
get the fuck Outta here.

1216
00:38:19,351 --> 00:38:22,560
What are you crazy that got
recommended to me by somebody.

1217
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,790
But it sounds like it sounds like it
sounds like craigslist for babies.

1218
00:38:25,810 --> 00:38:27,690
It sounds like a disaster
waiting to happen.

1219
00:38:27,790 --> 00:38:30,630
There's been a few that
I've said no to quite a few.

1220
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,250
Some of them that are just boring.

1221
00:38:32,430 --> 00:38:32,701
I'm like,

1222
00:38:32,701 --> 00:38:33,390
I'm not reading that.

1223
00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:34,110
I'm not selling that.

1224
00:38:34,110 --> 00:38:34,740
That's stupid.

1225
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:35,980
But also you're a comic

1226
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:39,000
who can send up ads and saw.

1227
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:42,100
I mean I think bill burr does this
where you kind of trashes the ad as he's

1228
00:38:42,101 --> 00:38:46,630
reading it because he lost naturebox
cause he told people to go eat apples.

1229
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:48,343
Really

1230
00:38:49,470 --> 00:38:50,303
fucking apple.

1231
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,540
So I mean that's totally.

1232
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:57,090
And that's something that's a tool you
have in your wheel house that has a

1233
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:58,210
effects down the list.

1234
00:38:58,211 --> 00:39:03,211
Like it's one reason why you can stream
live without really worrying about it.

1235
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:05,600
And I feel I can't like.

1236
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:07,750
So it's like at the end of the day,

1237
00:39:07,751 --> 00:39:10,270
like if things go completely
haywire on your podcast,

1238
00:39:10,690 --> 00:39:11,560
you can say,

1239
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:12,191
listen,

1240
00:39:12,191 --> 00:39:12,941
I'm a fucking comic,

1241
00:39:12,941 --> 00:39:13,560
what do I know?

1242
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:13,770
Right.

1243
00:39:13,770 --> 00:39:14,141
You like,

1244
00:39:14,141 --> 00:39:14,580
you can just,

1245
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:18,160
you can just pull the
rip cord and you're fine.

1246
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:18,820
Right?

1247
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:19,550
I can't do that.

1248
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:20,010
Right.

1249
00:39:20,010 --> 00:39:20,980
Like you can't say,

1250
00:39:20,981 --> 00:39:21,814
I'm a more

1251
00:39:24,750 --> 00:39:25,250
time.

1252
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:25,630
Yeah.

1253
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:26,261
So I mean,

1254
00:39:26,261 --> 00:39:26,411
I,

1255
00:39:26,411 --> 00:39:28,930
I can and there's certain
circumstances where I should,

1256
00:39:28,931 --> 00:39:29,650
but it's like I,

1257
00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:31,440
I should avoid those circumstances.

1258
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:31,960
Yes,

1259
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:32,793
yes.

1260
00:39:32,890 --> 00:39:33,723
So,

1261
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:34,240
uh,

1262
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:34,541
you know,

1263
00:39:34,541 --> 00:39:38,970
I have to prepare more
for podcasts and um,

1264
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,260
I feel like I personally,

1265
00:39:41,261 --> 00:39:42,094
I mean it's,

1266
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:44,830
it's as much as out of
concern for my guests as well.

1267
00:39:44,831 --> 00:39:45,664
Like I just,

1268
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:46,090
you know,

1269
00:39:46,090 --> 00:39:47,290
this is a high wire act,

1270
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:52,860
but I want to net normally so that
people feel free to be totally unguarded

1271
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:55,630
because they know that if
we have a spazz attack,

1272
00:39:55,631 --> 00:39:55,961
we can,

1273
00:39:55,961 --> 00:39:56,231
you know,

1274
00:39:56,231 --> 00:39:56,641
we can,

1275
00:39:56,641 --> 00:39:57,474
uh,

1276
00:39:57,490 --> 00:39:57,760
you know,

1277
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,490
even uttering spazz attack will screw.

1278
00:39:59,491 --> 00:40:00,640
So some people's careers.

1279
00:40:00,641 --> 00:40:00,790
Right.

1280
00:40:00,790 --> 00:40:03,490
We actually had a conversation about a
podcast that I talked to you about one of

1281
00:40:03,491 --> 00:40:06,220
your podcasts where you said that
you actually started it over.

1282
00:40:06,510 --> 00:40:07,343
You started.

1283
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:08,830
Let's try this again.

1284
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:10,720
Let's just start from scratch.

1285
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:11,090
Yeah,

1286
00:40:11,090 --> 00:40:11,301
yeah.

1287
00:40:11,301 --> 00:40:11,740
I mean I,

1288
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:12,573
maybe I,

1289
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:13,420
I think it would,

1290
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:16,360
I don't think it would be sport
into a sandwich podcasts that was.

1291
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,141
But yeah,

1292
00:40:17,141 --> 00:40:21,970
so I had a podcast that went completely
into the ditch for the first half hour.

1293
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:22,241
I mean,

1294
00:40:22,241 --> 00:40:23,074
just brutal.

1295
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:24,280
And I said,

1296
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:25,480
listen,

1297
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:26,200
there's a really,

1298
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:30,520
there's a good conversation for us to
have here and now I know how bad this can

1299
00:40:30,521 --> 00:40:30,990
go.

1300
00:40:30,990 --> 00:40:31,271
All right.

1301
00:40:31,271 --> 00:40:33,610
So like now I know just
where the track is.

1302
00:40:33,611 --> 00:40:37,390
I have to struggle to keep the train
on and so we're going to reboot.

1303
00:40:37,391 --> 00:40:39,370
We're going to start again
and let's see what happens.

1304
00:40:39,371 --> 00:40:39,971
And you know,

1305
00:40:39,971 --> 00:40:41,140
the podcast was,

1306
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:45,610
was not perfect and I got
some criticism for it,

1307
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:48,340
but people didn't understand
that we were like,

1308
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:48,780
you know,

1309
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:49,540
we had uh,

1310
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:49,901
you know,

1311
00:40:49,901 --> 00:40:50,350
we had,

1312
00:40:50,350 --> 00:40:50,650
I had,

1313
00:40:50,650 --> 00:40:53,770
I had seen the pit of alligators
and didn't want to fall in.

1314
00:40:54,690 --> 00:40:54,850
Well,

1315
00:40:54,850 --> 00:40:57,430
it made more sense though when
you told me that because I'm like,

1316
00:40:57,431 --> 00:40:57,701
okay,

1317
00:40:57,701 --> 00:41:02,230
it was heated before you even got to go
because you had already gone through a

1318
00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:03,280
half an hour of back and forth.

1319
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:04,500
Yeah.

1320
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:04,780
Um,

1321
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:05,010
I,

1322
00:41:05,010 --> 00:41:09,070
I think people need to understand what
it's like to do one of these things too

1323
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:10,100
because you know,

1324
00:41:10,330 --> 00:41:11,470
you do it so often,

1325
00:41:11,471 --> 00:41:13,930
it becomes pretty and
you're so good at talking.

1326
00:41:14,110 --> 00:41:18,460
You're such a good orator and you're so
articulate that it comes off smooth and

1327
00:41:18,461 --> 00:41:18,711
easy.

1328
00:41:18,711 --> 00:41:19,990
You just having a
conversation with someone,

1329
00:41:19,991 --> 00:41:22,990
but you're always considering the fact
that people are listening to this.

1330
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:24,070
You're always saying,

1331
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:24,910
how do I,

1332
00:41:24,910 --> 00:41:27,940
how do I get more out of him or her?

1333
00:41:28,090 --> 00:41:32,050
How do I take this and how do I get
this person to expand upon this?

1334
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:33,093
How do I,

1335
00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:35,330
how do I make this something,

1336
00:41:35,331 --> 00:41:36,350
make something out of this?

1337
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:40,340
This is one of the things that I felt
with Jack because he was talking in this

1338
00:41:40,341 --> 00:41:44,300
way and we're really working hard on
fixing all these issues and I'm like,

1339
00:41:44,301 --> 00:41:45,134
oh Jesus,

1340
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:50,170
I got to change my gears here and try
to figure out because it's almost like

1341
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,430
we'd have to restart again.

1342
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:54,200
Every time a question would be answered,

1343
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:56,840
he would stop talking and I'd go,

1344
00:41:56,841 --> 00:41:57,360
okay.

1345
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:58,220
The next day.

1346
00:41:58,230 --> 00:41:58,610
So long.

1347
00:41:58,610 --> 00:41:59,490
You forgot what you asked.

1348
00:41:59,491 --> 00:41:59,571
Yeah,

1349
00:41:59,571 --> 00:42:02,360
well it's almost like I have
to restart the momentum of it,

1350
00:42:02,810 --> 00:42:03,643
but.

1351
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:04,431
Well again,

1352
00:42:04,431 --> 00:42:04,630
I'm,

1353
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:05,391
I'm totally,

1354
00:42:05,391 --> 00:42:07,060
I'm that kind of speaker so you know,

1355
00:42:07,061 --> 00:42:07,610
I,

1356
00:42:07,610 --> 00:42:08,720
that wasn't a problem and.

1357
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:12,020
But I didn't know what he talked
like I'd never heard him talk ever.

1358
00:42:12,110 --> 00:42:14,840
So hearing him talk there
and talking to them live,

1359
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:15,441
you know,

1360
00:42:15,441 --> 00:42:17,810
I mean some people are fucking effortless.

1361
00:42:18,190 --> 00:42:18,680
Some people,

1362
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:20,510
like Elan took awhile,

1363
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:22,160
like we had to start drinking now.

1364
00:42:22,161 --> 00:42:22,994
That was brutal.

1365
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:25,071
But I mean,

1366
00:42:25,071 --> 00:42:27,770
you know how much I tried to
micromanage that behind the scenes.

1367
00:42:27,771 --> 00:42:28,010
Right?

1368
00:42:28,010 --> 00:42:28,843
Like I was

1369
00:42:30,290 --> 00:42:31,123
trying to figure that out.

1370
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:32,473
And you,

1371
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:34,490
you guys basically broke all the rules.

1372
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:37,780
I thought I laid down
and Ilan [inaudible],

1373
00:42:37,970 --> 00:42:41,880
Ilan tweeted y'all be on Joe's podcast
Thursday night at 9:00 or whatever.

1374
00:42:42,510 --> 00:42:43,343
So,

1375
00:42:43,550 --> 00:42:43,701
but,

1376
00:42:43,701 --> 00:42:43,971
you know,

1377
00:42:43,971 --> 00:42:44,210
I mean,

1378
00:42:44,210 --> 00:42:45,540
I didn't want you guys to go live.

1379
00:42:45,950 --> 00:42:46,700
I wanted,

1380
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:48,650
I wanted you to both have a chance to say,

1381
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:49,191
wait a minute,

1382
00:42:49,191 --> 00:42:50,390
this is smoking a blunt,

1383
00:42:50,391 --> 00:42:51,560
really the thing we want to be doing here.

1384
00:42:52,270 --> 00:42:53,060
Uh,

1385
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:53,893
so,

1386
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:54,380
you know,

1387
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:57,980
you didn't take my advice and it was what
it was when we were drunk by the time

1388
00:42:57,981 --> 00:42:58,814
that we'd came out.

1389
00:42:58,820 --> 00:42:59,570
That was what's,

1390
00:42:59,570 --> 00:43:03,380
what's interesting to me is
we were drinking from the
beginning of the podcast.

1391
00:43:03,381 --> 00:43:04,280
We started drinking whiskey.

1392
00:43:04,490 --> 00:43:08,480
We both had two or three glasses of
whiskey before the weed came out.

1393
00:43:08,481 --> 00:43:09,260
Nobody cared.

1394
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:11,600
The fact that the CEO of Tesla was drunk,

1395
00:43:11,990 --> 00:43:13,340
like no one cared about that.

1396
00:43:13,370 --> 00:43:13,541
I mean,

1397
00:43:13,541 --> 00:43:14,301
it wasn't drunk,

1398
00:43:14,301 --> 00:43:15,400
but he shouldn't have been driving.

1399
00:43:15,830 --> 00:43:17,000
I don't know if that was obvious.

1400
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:19,240
I don't know if they saw
that you were drinking.

1401
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:20,520
It was obvious in the beginning,

1402
00:43:20,570 --> 00:43:21,680
pouring the whiskey.

1403
00:43:22,070 --> 00:43:22,240
I mean,

1404
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:23,061
it was on the table.

1405
00:43:23,061 --> 00:43:23,721
We had ice.

1406
00:43:23,721 --> 00:43:25,040
We're clinking glasses,

1407
00:43:25,041 --> 00:43:25,700
salute.

1408
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:26,960
I mean it was very obvious.

1409
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:27,870
I mean,

1410
00:43:27,870 --> 00:43:30,110
the problem for me
there with that podcast,

1411
00:43:30,111 --> 00:43:34,100
frankly it was that I feel
like you both got unlucky with,

1412
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:37,500
which is where he was in his
life at that moment because it.

1413
00:43:37,930 --> 00:43:40,880
So what that podcast showcased,

1414
00:43:40,881 --> 00:43:41,900
at least for the first,

1415
00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:43,340
I don't know,

1416
00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:48,290
90 minutes was just how
many user interface problems
you could have with Elon.

1417
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:48,591
Right.

1418
00:43:48,591 --> 00:43:50,260
Like he just showed up as,

1419
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:51,530
as kind of fairly weird,

1420
00:43:51,531 --> 00:43:52,250
right?

1421
00:43:52,250 --> 00:43:52,850
He's not,

1422
00:43:52,850 --> 00:43:55,040
he's not always like that by any stretch.

1423
00:43:55,041 --> 00:43:58,600
I mean he can give a
very loose interview and.

1424
00:43:58,730 --> 00:43:59,840
But you were working.

1425
00:43:59,841 --> 00:44:03,470
I mean it was just absolutely heroic
work trying to keep that conversation

1426
00:44:03,530 --> 00:44:05,090
happening in the beginning.

1427
00:44:05,210 --> 00:44:06,440
But once we got loose,

1428
00:44:06,470 --> 00:44:06,990
yeah,

1429
00:44:06,990 --> 00:44:07,431
that was good.

1430
00:44:07,431 --> 00:44:08,264
But it was still,

1431
00:44:08,290 --> 00:44:08,510
you know,

1432
00:44:08,510 --> 00:44:13,510
he was just in a space that he was so
massively stressed and so overworked and

1433
00:44:15,321 --> 00:44:15,610
just.

1434
00:44:15,610 --> 00:44:16,670
I mean he had,

1435
00:44:16,970 --> 00:44:17,510
you know,

1436
00:44:17,510 --> 00:44:19,730
fires everywhere that had to be put out.

1437
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:22,000
And so I just felt,

1438
00:44:22,010 --> 00:44:22,191
you know,

1439
00:44:22,191 --> 00:44:22,941
as a friend,

1440
00:44:22,941 --> 00:44:23,511
I just felt like,

1441
00:44:23,511 --> 00:44:23,721
okay,

1442
00:44:23,721 --> 00:44:26,190
this is sort of the wrong
time to be doing this.

1443
00:44:26,750 --> 00:44:28,310
And so I just felt,

1444
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:28,581
you know,

1445
00:44:28,581 --> 00:44:29,540
it just felt unlucky to me.

1446
00:44:29,541 --> 00:44:30,240
So,

1447
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:31,073
um,

1448
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:32,220
because he's,

1449
00:44:32,970 --> 00:44:33,600
uh,

1450
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:33,961
again,

1451
00:44:33,961 --> 00:44:34,141
I,

1452
00:44:34,141 --> 00:44:34,530
I,

1453
00:44:34,530 --> 00:44:34,771
you know,

1454
00:44:34,771 --> 00:44:35,431
I see him in,

1455
00:44:35,431 --> 00:44:37,650
in many other moments and he can be,

1456
00:44:39,740 --> 00:44:40,710
if that was out,

1457
00:44:40,711 --> 00:44:42,720
there was actually a circumstance
where I was looking at the comments,

1458
00:44:42,721 --> 00:44:42,961
right?

1459
00:44:42,961 --> 00:44:43,231
You know,

1460
00:44:43,231 --> 00:44:43,481
and,

1461
00:44:43,481 --> 00:44:44,071
and Alice saying,

1462
00:44:44,071 --> 00:44:44,270
okay,

1463
00:44:44,270 --> 00:44:44,760
these are,

1464
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:48,990
these are people who are basically
reading him as somebody who is,

1465
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:51,150
is much stranger than in fact he,

1466
00:44:51,210 --> 00:44:52,140
he ever is.

1467
00:44:52,170 --> 00:44:54,810
And I could see why they
were doing that because he,

1468
00:44:54,811 --> 00:44:55,110
the guy,

1469
00:44:55,110 --> 00:44:57,840
he just seemed in a very
stressed space in his life.

1470
00:44:57,900 --> 00:44:58,711
What was interesting,

1471
00:44:58,711 --> 00:45:02,550
he was very different when you first got
here versus when the Mike came on right

1472
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:03,990
when he first got here,

1473
00:45:04,350 --> 00:45:09,350
he pulls out the fucking blow torch and
starts shooting this flame thrower in

1474
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:10,530
the middle of the hallway.

1475
00:45:10,530 --> 00:45:12,000
And we're laughing and I'm like,

1476
00:45:12,001 --> 00:45:13,110
he's going to be easy.

1477
00:45:13,111 --> 00:45:13,944
This is great.

1478
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:17,870
And then we sat down and
then right off the bat and,

1479
00:45:17,871 --> 00:45:18,090
um,

1480
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:20,940
I'm just trying to
massage it and get them,

1481
00:45:20,970 --> 00:45:21,360
get them,

1482
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:22,193
get them going.

1483
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:23,400
Although I honestly,

1484
00:45:23,401 --> 00:45:26,100
I think that is another
consequence of live.

1485
00:45:26,101 --> 00:45:26,261
I mean,

1486
00:45:26,261 --> 00:45:26,521
I'm not,

1487
00:45:26,521 --> 00:45:28,770
I'm not arguing that you
shouldn't be live because it,

1488
00:45:29,270 --> 00:45:31,620
it has a massive
advantage for you as well,

1489
00:45:31,621 --> 00:45:33,270
but it is,

1490
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:35,100
there's just a different feeling.

1491
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:39,990
If I knew that this was being taped and
I could rethink the thing we're about to

1492
00:45:39,991 --> 00:45:41,730
say about Liam Neeson or whatever it is,

1493
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:42,850
you know,

1494
00:45:42,850 --> 00:45:43,050
it's,

1495
00:45:43,050 --> 00:45:43,883
it's different.

1496
00:45:43,930 --> 00:45:44,763
And so,

1497
00:45:44,830 --> 00:45:45,250
um,

1498
00:45:45,250 --> 00:45:48,960
but will the Liam Neeson story
is a perfect example there.

1499
00:45:48,961 --> 00:45:49,150
Okay.

1500
00:45:49,150 --> 00:45:49,410
Yeah,

1501
00:45:49,410 --> 00:45:50,071
let's go.

1502
00:45:50,071 --> 00:45:52,920
They're a perfect
example of a story where,

1503
00:45:53,550 --> 00:45:54,001
you know,

1504
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:55,110
if you are Liam's friend,

1505
00:45:55,111 --> 00:45:56,030
you would go toe.

1506
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:56,940
Tell that one.

1507
00:45:57,540 --> 00:45:58,680
Don't tell that one he's like,

1508
00:45:58,681 --> 00:45:59,520
but I want to be honest,

1509
00:46:00,130 --> 00:46:01,170
like don't,

1510
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:01,591
don't,

1511
00:46:01,591 --> 00:46:02,730
you could be honest with me.

1512
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:06,540
I'm not going to judge you if you tell
me that someone got raped and you went

1513
00:46:06,541 --> 00:46:11,541
out with a baseball bat for a week
looking for a black man to beat up on the

1514
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:12,870
hill to kill.

1515
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:13,441
I'd be like,

1516
00:46:13,441 --> 00:46:15,030
oh Jesus Christ man.

1517
00:46:15,450 --> 00:46:17,700
Like what the fuck was going through
your head at that point in time?

1518
00:46:17,701 --> 00:46:17,881
Like,

1519
00:46:17,881 --> 00:46:18,630
that's terrible.

1520
00:46:18,630 --> 00:46:18,940
Yeah.

1521
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:19,111
Like,

1522
00:46:19,111 --> 00:46:20,100
I feel awful about it,

1523
00:46:20,101 --> 00:46:21,210
I can't believe that was me,

1524
00:46:21,970 --> 00:46:22,950
but it didn't happen.

1525
00:46:23,010 --> 00:46:23,843
Nothing happened.

1526
00:46:23,970 --> 00:46:24,940
And now you know,

1527
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:28,020
people are calling him a racist
and they don't want them in movies.

1528
00:46:28,021 --> 00:46:28,854
And.

1529
00:46:28,990 --> 00:46:29,150
Well,

1530
00:46:29,150 --> 00:46:29,310
I mean,

1531
00:46:29,310 --> 00:46:29,730
this is,

1532
00:46:29,730 --> 00:46:31,470
this is fascinating to me because again,

1533
00:46:31,471 --> 00:46:34,680
this is a much larger problem
with massive implications.

1534
00:46:35,130 --> 00:46:40,130
We need to think through the whole
process of redemption for people in our

1535
00:46:41,911 --> 00:46:42,480
society,

1536
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:42,630
right?

1537
00:46:42,630 --> 00:46:42,771
Like,

1538
00:46:42,771 --> 00:46:43,150
like we,

1539
00:46:43,150 --> 00:46:45,990
we have to understand what are the,

1540
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:51,020
what are the criteria for successful
apologies and for forgiveness or like just

1541
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:53,130
what,

1542
00:46:53,130 --> 00:46:55,000
because especially,

1543
00:46:55,010 --> 00:46:55,210
I mean,

1544
00:46:55,210 --> 00:46:55,710
we're in,

1545
00:46:55,710 --> 00:47:00,710
we're in a world where people are having
their reputations destroyed in their

1546
00:47:00,841 --> 00:47:01,501
careers,

1547
00:47:01,501 --> 00:47:03,290
threatened for tweets,

1548
00:47:03,310 --> 00:47:04,990
they sent us teenagers yet.

1549
00:47:04,991 --> 00:47:05,180
Right?

1550
00:47:05,180 --> 00:47:05,380
And,

1551
00:47:05,380 --> 00:47:06,091
and you know,

1552
00:47:06,091 --> 00:47:06,790
more this,

1553
00:47:06,790 --> 00:47:07,980
this is the dorseys point.

1554
00:47:08,850 --> 00:47:10,710
Things are not disappearing
online anymore.

1555
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:11,610
In a certain point.

1556
00:47:11,670 --> 00:47:12,320
You know,

1557
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:17,320
everyone is going to be a three 60 kind
of panopticon view of everyone's life.

1558
00:47:18,090 --> 00:47:18,271
You know,

1559
00:47:18,271 --> 00:47:22,050
there are people who have grown up on
social media and everything is out there.

1560
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:23,513
And,

1561
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:25,253
um,

1562
00:47:25,470 --> 00:47:25,651
I mean,

1563
00:47:25,651 --> 00:47:30,651
the irony here for me is that you have
progress progressives and the people on

1564
00:47:31,001 --> 00:47:34,840
the far left who received
a disclosure like,

1565
00:47:34,910 --> 00:47:35,170
you know,

1566
00:47:35,170 --> 00:47:39,310
Liam Neeson's justice take
his and they just want,

1567
00:47:39,850 --> 00:47:41,620
they just want to see him burned alive,

1568
00:47:41,621 --> 00:47:41,870
right?

1569
00:47:41,870 --> 00:47:42,400
A little,

1570
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:44,620
let's just do the wicker man
on this guy because this is,

1571
00:47:44,950 --> 00:47:45,940
this is so awful.

1572
00:47:46,690 --> 00:47:48,520
And yet alongside that,

1573
00:47:48,610 --> 00:47:52,790
the same people on the left
are people who have as a,

1574
00:47:52,820 --> 00:47:54,670
as a genuine ethical norm,

1575
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:56,980
the rehabilitation of murderers,

1576
00:47:57,340 --> 00:48:02,340
or you could be somebody who spent 20
years in prison for a crime you admit,

1577
00:48:02,711 --> 00:48:07,240
you committed and there's
this norm around redemption.

1578
00:48:07,510 --> 00:48:08,590
And uh,

1579
00:48:08,860 --> 00:48:09,281
so there's,

1580
00:48:09,281 --> 00:48:09,490
you know,

1581
00:48:09,490 --> 00:48:10,990
there's no way to square those two things.

1582
00:48:11,230 --> 00:48:13,810
They're constantly holding
news to two contradictions,

1583
00:48:13,811 --> 00:48:14,080
right?

1584
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:14,261
I mean,

1585
00:48:14,261 --> 00:48:15,010
here's another one,

1586
00:48:15,010 --> 00:48:16,710
women's rights and supportive.

1587
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:17,553
The Hijab,

1588
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:18,760
I mean,

1589
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:19,540
yeah,

1590
00:48:19,540 --> 00:48:20,950
this is what's going on there.

1591
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:21,873
How do you do that?

1592
00:48:21,930 --> 00:48:22,690
You know,

1593
00:48:22,690 --> 00:48:24,460
don't be Islamophobic,

1594
00:48:24,670 --> 00:48:26,860
but also support women's
rights and gay rights.

1595
00:48:27,490 --> 00:48:28,210
Okay.

1596
00:48:28,210 --> 00:48:28,641
Well,

1597
00:48:28,641 --> 00:48:30,100
I think Eric Weinstein,

1598
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:32,500
our mutual friend calls these,

1599
00:48:32,501 --> 00:48:32,761
the,

1600
00:48:32,761 --> 00:48:33,250
um,

1601
00:48:33,250 --> 00:48:36,220
the Hilbert problems for
social justice warriors.

1602
00:48:36,221 --> 00:48:39,530
And David Hilpert was a very
famous mathematician who at,

1603
00:48:39,580 --> 00:48:39,830
at,

1604
00:48:39,830 --> 00:48:42,280
at the turn of the 19th century,

1605
00:48:42,281 --> 00:48:45,460
posed a set of problems
in mathematics that,

1606
00:48:45,490 --> 00:48:45,760
you know,

1607
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:46,541
we're just,

1608
00:48:46,541 --> 00:48:46,720
you know,

1609
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:46,880
the,

1610
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:47,710
the,

1611
00:48:47,710 --> 00:48:51,100
on his list of the most
desirable questions that they
like the hardest questions

1612
00:48:51,101 --> 00:48:52,960
and the most consequential
questions to answer.

1613
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:53,860
And so,

1614
00:48:53,860 --> 00:48:54,130
you know,

1615
00:48:54,130 --> 00:48:55,420
Eric has been a mathematician,

1616
00:48:55,421 --> 00:48:57,190
has flipped that around
ironically and said these were,

1617
00:48:57,191 --> 00:48:59,870
these were the questions that social
justice warriors have to answer and there

1618
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:01,990
are these impossible
oppositions of this sort.

1619
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:03,041
But,

1620
00:49:03,041 --> 00:49:04,330
so the Liam Neeson thing,

1621
00:49:05,140 --> 00:49:05,441
and,

1622
00:49:05,441 --> 00:49:05,620
you know,

1623
00:49:05,620 --> 00:49:06,880
forgive me if I,

1624
00:49:07,030 --> 00:49:09,580
if there's some detail that has
come out that I'm not aware of,

1625
00:49:09,581 --> 00:49:12,550
but my understanding of it is he,

1626
00:49:12,551 --> 00:49:12,731
you know,

1627
00:49:12,731 --> 00:49:17,470
he had a friend who was raped and
then he reported this state of mind,

1628
00:49:17,471 --> 00:49:22,471
this murderous state of mind he was in
where he was walking around with a few.

1629
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:24,840
He calls it a cautious.

1630
00:49:24,890 --> 00:49:26,420
I'm a British word for like a,

1631
00:49:26,770 --> 00:49:28,390
like a small metal club,

1632
00:49:28,391 --> 00:49:29,040
right?

1633
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:29,873
Um,

1634
00:49:30,490 --> 00:49:33,040
it was like a black jack
or another term for it,

1635
00:49:33,041 --> 00:49:33,700
I think.

1636
00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:38,700
And I'm looking for a black
guy to kill your life,

1637
00:49:39,660 --> 00:49:42,610
doesn't hoping someone's going to come
out of the woodwork and threatened him so

1638
00:49:42,611 --> 00:49:47,611
that he could kill this guy in this act
of instrumental violence because his

1639
00:49:47,681 --> 00:49:49,150
friend had been raped by a black guy.

1640
00:49:49,180 --> 00:49:49,351
Right?

1641
00:49:49,351 --> 00:49:50,830
So it's like any black I will do now,

1642
00:49:50,950 --> 00:49:55,950
that's likely the extra horrific
wrinkle to the story right now.

1643
00:49:57,310 --> 00:50:02,310
And he's confessing this as a kind of
a symptom of transient mental illness,

1644
00:50:02,741 --> 00:50:03,850
at least as far as I know.

1645
00:50:03,851 --> 00:50:04,151
It's like a.

1646
00:50:04,151 --> 00:50:07,090
he's horrified by the fact that
he was in the state of mind.

1647
00:50:07,091 --> 00:50:07,241
Right?

1648
00:50:07,241 --> 00:50:08,500
Can you imagine like Aida,

1649
00:50:08,550 --> 00:50:09,910
Liam Neeson it actor.

1650
00:50:10,950 --> 00:50:12,400
I have everything to lose.

1651
00:50:12,910 --> 00:50:16,000
And although I don't remember at what
point in his life he said this happened.

1652
00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:18,370
Can you imagine that?

1653
00:50:18,371 --> 00:50:19,660
I was in the state of mind.

1654
00:50:19,661 --> 00:50:20,260
Right?

1655
00:50:20,260 --> 00:50:21,430
And this is,

1656
00:50:22,030 --> 00:50:22,541
as you say,

1657
00:50:22,541 --> 00:50:24,550
at an all too honest disclosure,

1658
00:50:25,420 --> 00:50:28,220
but it is damn interesting.

1659
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:28,850
Right?

1660
00:50:28,850 --> 00:50:33,170
And it is the kind of thing that
we should be able to talk about.

1661
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:33,650
Right?

1662
00:50:33,650 --> 00:50:38,650
And it's not an the fact that this is
becoming synonymous with racism seems just

1663
00:50:39,381 --> 00:50:42,290
wrong given given how
he's two he described,

1664
00:50:42,291 --> 00:50:43,190
or at least how I've,

1665
00:50:43,250 --> 00:50:45,050
I've heard this because he's saying,

1666
00:50:45,051 --> 00:50:45,351
listen,

1667
00:50:45,351 --> 00:50:50,180
if this had been an Armenian guy
or an Italian or a Japanese guy,

1668
00:50:50,330 --> 00:50:51,590
I'd be looking for one of them,

1669
00:50:51,620 --> 00:50:51,860
right?

1670
00:50:51,860 --> 00:50:52,040
I mean,

1671
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:52,260
what,

1672
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:52,640
what,

1673
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:53,690
what this was,

1674
00:50:54,050 --> 00:50:58,970
at least on his telling is the
virus of instrumental violence.

1675
00:50:58,971 --> 00:50:59,121
I mean,

1676
00:50:59,121 --> 00:50:59,660
the Va,

1677
00:50:59,660 --> 00:51:01,850
the virus of like,

1678
00:51:02,290 --> 00:51:06,160
this is how every blood feud ever
in human history gets started.

1679
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:06,950
Like you,

1680
00:51:06,950 --> 00:51:09,830
like someone from your
tribe killed my brother.

1681
00:51:10,370 --> 00:51:13,730
And now what I want to do is
kill anyone from your tribe,

1682
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:13,970
right?

1683
00:51:13,970 --> 00:51:15,220
Doesn't matter who you are.

1684
00:51:15,430 --> 00:51:15,920
And,

1685
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:17,000
and that's,

1686
00:51:17,690 --> 00:51:17,931
you know,

1687
00:51:17,931 --> 00:51:20,750
clearly as toxic as it gets,

1688
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:21,170
you know,

1689
00:51:21,170 --> 00:51:22,003
ethically.

1690
00:51:22,250 --> 00:51:24,260
But that's not racism,

1691
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:24,681
right?

1692
00:51:24,681 --> 00:51:25,514
That's just,

1693
00:51:25,700 --> 00:51:27,800
that is that we have a word for it.

1694
00:51:27,801 --> 00:51:29,420
It's an instrumental violence.

1695
00:51:29,970 --> 00:51:30,740
Um,

1696
00:51:30,740 --> 00:51:31,280
but,

1697
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:31,530
you know,

1698
00:51:31,530 --> 00:51:31,821
yeah,

1699
00:51:31,821 --> 00:51:34,190
obviously he's getting
totally pilloried over this,

1700
00:51:34,970 --> 00:51:35,840
but we need,

1701
00:51:37,430 --> 00:51:42,430
we just need to figure out how to talk
about how people can redeem themselves

1702
00:51:43,580 --> 00:51:46,030
once something this unsavory is,

1703
00:51:46,031 --> 00:51:48,080
is revealed about their past.

1704
00:51:48,081 --> 00:51:49,520
Whether they reveal it
or whether it's just,

1705
00:51:49,580 --> 00:51:50,090
you know,

1706
00:51:50,090 --> 00:51:50,990
found out about them.

1707
00:51:51,530 --> 00:51:51,981
Yeah.

1708
00:51:51,981 --> 00:51:52,400
Um,

1709
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:52,731
I mean,

1710
00:51:52,731 --> 00:51:53,840
it is racism though,

1711
00:51:53,841 --> 00:51:54,111
Ryan,

1712
00:51:54,111 --> 00:51:56,660
because he's specifically
looking for a black guy.

1713
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:57,740
I mean,

1714
00:51:57,740 --> 00:51:59,900
I understand that it's a
part of the other tribe.

1715
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:00,081
No,

1716
00:52:00,081 --> 00:52:02,330
but it doesn't suggest that he has,

1717
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:05,570
that he dispose that he feels one
way or another about black people.

1718
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:05,930
It's like,

1719
00:52:05,930 --> 00:52:06,980
like if you told me,

1720
00:52:07,450 --> 00:52:08,283
um,

1721
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:10,473
uh,

1722
00:52:10,820 --> 00:52:11,000
yeah,

1723
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:11,160
he,

1724
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:11,660
he could,

1725
00:52:11,660 --> 00:52:13,250
he could have said again,

1726
00:52:13,251 --> 00:52:15,450
it could have been a,

1727
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:16,393
an Irish guy,

1728
00:52:16,430 --> 00:52:16,701
right?

1729
00:52:16,701 --> 00:52:17,534
Or it could have been mental.

1730
00:52:17,660 --> 00:52:18,351
I guess he's Irish.

1731
00:52:18,351 --> 00:52:18,441
He's,

1732
00:52:18,441 --> 00:52:19,370
he's a Scottish or Irish.

1733
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:20,030
Um,

1734
00:52:20,030 --> 00:52:21,590
it could have been an English guy.

1735
00:52:21,620 --> 00:52:21,801
Right.

1736
00:52:21,801 --> 00:52:23,330
It could've been like any type.

1737
00:52:23,420 --> 00:52:23,721
Right.

1738
00:52:23,721 --> 00:52:28,010
It's like the salience of the
tribe is what he was reacting to,

1739
00:52:28,220 --> 00:52:29,390
at least in his description.

1740
00:52:29,810 --> 00:52:33,740
I don't know why you wouldn't take him
at his word given that he didn't have to

1741
00:52:33,741 --> 00:52:35,270
say any of this in the first place.

1742
00:52:35,270 --> 00:52:35,421
Right.

1743
00:52:35,421 --> 00:52:35,571
I mean,

1744
00:52:35,571 --> 00:52:35,691
like,

1745
00:52:35,691 --> 00:52:39,470
this is an amazingly honest
and unnecessary disclosure,

1746
00:52:39,950 --> 00:52:40,970
but it's,

1747
00:52:40,971 --> 00:52:41,630
um,

1748
00:52:41,630 --> 00:52:44,000
and I don't think people would
think of it as racism if he,

1749
00:52:44,060 --> 00:52:46,940
if the story simply was a,

1750
00:52:47,420 --> 00:52:52,130
she got raped by a cop and I was
just hoping to go kill a cop.

1751
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:53,180
Right.

1752
00:52:53,180 --> 00:52:54,050
The same story.

1753
00:52:54,110 --> 00:52:54,943
Right.

1754
00:52:55,010 --> 00:52:55,843
Um,

1755
00:52:56,060 --> 00:52:56,541
and,

1756
00:52:56,541 --> 00:52:57,374
uh,

1757
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:58,273
so yeah,

1758
00:52:58,280 --> 00:53:03,280
but we're so trigger happy in our
outrage with respect to anything.

1759
00:53:04,090 --> 00:53:05,120
Why do you think that is?

1760
00:53:05,180 --> 00:53:05,471
Like what,

1761
00:53:05,471 --> 00:53:06,291
what is going on?

1762
00:53:06,291 --> 00:53:10,310
Because outrage seems to be more in
season than it's ever been in my lifetime.

1763
00:53:10,311 --> 00:53:10,590
I don't,

1764
00:53:10,590 --> 00:53:15,590
I don't ever remember
outrage being so just such a.

1765
00:53:16,550 --> 00:53:16,970
it's,

1766
00:53:16,970 --> 00:53:17,803
it's,

1767
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:19,010
it's recreational.

1768
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:19,640
Yeah.

1769
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:20,090
There's a,

1770
00:53:20,090 --> 00:53:20,800
there's a,

1771
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:21,800
I mean it's back to Jack.

1772
00:53:21,801 --> 00:53:22,560
I mean it's a lot.

1773
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:24,950
It has a lot to do with
social media and twitter in.

1774
00:53:25,610 --> 00:53:26,000
Yeah,

1775
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:26,833
I mean you have.

1776
00:53:27,450 --> 00:53:28,021
So for instance,

1777
00:53:28,021 --> 00:53:33,021
I missed the whole Covington highschool
Catholic fiasco not onto basically was

1778
00:53:33,901 --> 00:53:34,590
ignoring twitter.

1779
00:53:34,590 --> 00:53:35,241
I saw it,

1780
00:53:35,241 --> 00:53:36,630
saw it out of the corner of my eye,

1781
00:53:36,631 --> 00:53:37,160
like men,

1782
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:37,741
this is interesting,

1783
00:53:37,741 --> 00:53:38,490
this is,

1784
00:53:38,490 --> 00:53:39,151
this is blowing up,

1785
00:53:39,151 --> 00:53:40,230
but I,

1786
00:53:40,330 --> 00:53:42,770
I was so off twitter that I had,

1787
00:53:42,780 --> 00:53:45,570
there was no temptation
for a hot take from me.

1788
00:53:45,571 --> 00:53:46,320
Right.

1789
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:50,700
And I saw these people just torching
their reputations by taking these,

1790
00:53:50,890 --> 00:53:54,810
like Kathy Griffin basically calling
for the docs and have these kids,

1791
00:53:55,170 --> 00:53:55,470
you know,

1792
00:53:55,470 --> 00:53:57,860
given all that she has suffered from,

1793
00:53:57,930 --> 00:54:01,620
from mob behavior online and
she's whipping up her own mob.

1794
00:54:01,621 --> 00:54:02,454
It was just nuts,

1795
00:54:02,730 --> 00:54:03,600
but it's normal.

1796
00:54:03,660 --> 00:54:04,650
That's what people do.

1797
00:54:04,651 --> 00:54:06,930
It's what the platform
is calling out of people,

1798
00:54:06,931 --> 00:54:11,370
but it's also when people have been
shamed and they've done something awful.

1799
00:54:11,430 --> 00:54:13,770
Then they reinforce their base like that.

1800
00:54:13,771 --> 00:54:18,771
Now she's like his so heavily hard left
because the right wing ran after her.

1801
00:54:18,991 --> 00:54:20,610
Like anyone on the right
that does anything.

1802
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:24,900
She's calling for her side
to go after this person.

1803
00:54:24,901 --> 00:54:27,810
Like reinforcing that
she's a part of that tribe,

1804
00:54:27,811 --> 00:54:29,370
that she's a part of that left wing tribe.

1805
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:30,220
Yeah.

1806
00:54:30,220 --> 00:54:30,630
Yeah.

1807
00:54:30,630 --> 00:54:31,740
Well it's.

1808
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:35,610
So obviously everyone has
a lot to lose doing this,

1809
00:54:35,611 --> 00:54:40,380
especially in a case where all the facts
aren't in and if you just waited a beat

1810
00:54:40,381 --> 00:54:42,030
and even the New York
Times got this wrong,

1811
00:54:42,031 --> 00:54:45,090
the New York Times writes an article
about the kids in the Maga hat that they

1812
00:54:45,091 --> 00:54:46,200
have to resend.

1813
00:54:46,740 --> 00:54:48,780
And the.

1814
00:54:49,260 --> 00:54:53,400
So then as the dust is settling
and I see these people,

1815
00:54:53,401 --> 00:54:54,630
some people are doubling down,

1816
00:54:54,631 --> 00:54:57,120
some people are issuing public apologies.

1817
00:54:57,750 --> 00:55:02,750
I see somebody who's actually kind of
branded herself as one of my enemies for

1818
00:55:03,340 --> 00:55:04,860
some reason I can't fathom.

1819
00:55:04,861 --> 00:55:06,750
But this journalist Kara Swisher,

1820
00:55:07,310 --> 00:55:07,920
uh,

1821
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:08,341
who,

1822
00:55:08,341 --> 00:55:08,570
um,

1823
00:55:08,570 --> 00:55:08,791
you know,

1824
00:55:08,791 --> 00:55:09,030
she,

1825
00:55:09,030 --> 00:55:13,080
she works for a recode and vox now,

1826
00:55:13,081 --> 00:55:15,070
but she's got a big podcast and she's a,

1827
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:16,380
she actually writes
for the New York Times.

1828
00:55:16,380 --> 00:55:17,580
Now she's got an opinion piece,

1829
00:55:17,980 --> 00:55:19,500
a regular column for the New York Times.

1830
00:55:20,220 --> 00:55:21,330
She's a tech journalist.

1831
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:26,310
And I happened to know she doesn't
like me because she's tweeted against,

1832
00:55:26,311 --> 00:55:26,461
you know,

1833
00:55:26,461 --> 00:55:30,510
she's said some disparaging things about
me on twitter and we had an offline

1834
00:55:30,511 --> 00:55:31,380
conversation about it.

1835
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:32,250
Uh,

1836
00:55:32,250 --> 00:55:33,390
but I saw her,

1837
00:55:33,420 --> 00:55:38,040
she said one of the most vituperative and
fairly crazy things in response to the

1838
00:55:38,041 --> 00:55:41,580
kids initially and then once
more information came out,

1839
00:55:41,610 --> 00:55:44,160
she walked it back and
she basically apologized,

1840
00:55:44,190 --> 00:55:44,640
you know,

1841
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:45,473
good for her twitter.

1842
00:55:45,750 --> 00:55:46,240
And so,

1843
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:46,741
so I said,

1844
00:55:46,741 --> 00:55:47,650
good for you Cara.

1845
00:55:47,710 --> 00:55:48,840
I just wanted to,

1846
00:55:48,890 --> 00:55:53,400
to support this norm of acknowledging
that you got something wrong.

1847
00:55:53,401 --> 00:55:58,200
And I wanted to do it even I wanted to
actually do it for someone who I know

1848
00:55:58,201 --> 00:55:59,040
really doesn't like me.

1849
00:55:59,041 --> 00:55:59,251
Like,

1850
00:55:59,251 --> 00:55:59,430
I mean,

1851
00:55:59,430 --> 00:56:01,120
that was an added bonus
for me because that's,

1852
00:56:01,140 --> 00:56:01,390
that's a,

1853
00:56:01,390 --> 00:56:04,020
that's another norm that
I think we should support.

1854
00:56:04,050 --> 00:56:04,860
It's like,

1855
00:56:04,860 --> 00:56:05,550
like we should,

1856
00:56:05,550 --> 00:56:08,430
we should play fair even with our enemies.

1857
00:56:08,850 --> 00:56:09,960
And I mean honestly,

1858
00:56:09,961 --> 00:56:10,140
I,

1859
00:56:10,140 --> 00:56:10,441
you know,

1860
00:56:10,441 --> 00:56:13,410
I try to play fair even with
people who never play fair with me.

1861
00:56:13,411 --> 00:56:16,180
Even someone like Glenn
Greenwald or raise ocelot,

1862
00:56:16,310 --> 00:56:19,620
I mean people who have just
lied about me endlessly.

1863
00:56:19,621 --> 00:56:21,330
If I get something wrong about them,

1864
00:56:21,331 --> 00:56:22,770
I publicly apologized for it.

1865
00:56:23,470 --> 00:56:24,250
Um,

1866
00:56:24,250 --> 00:56:29,250
so I did this and this was at the
absolute 11th hour with respect to this,

1867
00:56:29,950 --> 00:56:30,401
this,

1868
00:56:30,401 --> 00:56:30,710
uh,

1869
00:56:30,710 --> 00:56:31,543
you know,

1870
00:56:31,860 --> 00:56:36,860
scandal online and when I saw the
kind of pain I was getting just for,

1871
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:38,530
you know,

1872
00:56:38,530 --> 00:56:42,490
supporting Kara in her walk back of this
thing we had at a moment when it was

1873
00:56:42,491 --> 00:56:44,170
obvious she should have walked this back.

1874
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:45,430
I got people saying,

1875
00:56:45,431 --> 00:56:45,670
you know,

1876
00:56:45,670 --> 00:56:47,410
unsubscribing from your podcast,

1877
00:56:47,411 --> 00:56:47,771
you are,

1878
00:56:47,771 --> 00:56:47,981
you know,

1879
00:56:47,981 --> 00:56:49,570
now I know you're a fucking racist,

1880
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:50,020
you know,

1881
00:56:50,020 --> 00:56:50,511
it was just,

1882
00:56:50,511 --> 00:56:52,990
I just sure pain and I just thought,

1883
00:56:52,991 --> 00:56:53,531
wow man,

1884
00:56:53,531 --> 00:56:53,801
that's,

1885
00:56:53,801 --> 00:56:54,160
you know,

1886
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:57,750
it's like you just touched this
thing at the very end and you're,

1887
00:56:57,751 --> 00:56:58,040
you're,

1888
00:56:58,040 --> 00:56:58,500
you know,

1889
00:56:58,500 --> 00:57:00,760
it's the slime gets on you.

1890
00:57:01,140 --> 00:57:01,973
Um,

1891
00:57:02,350 --> 00:57:02,681
so yeah,

1892
00:57:02,681 --> 00:57:03,514
it is,

1893
00:57:03,730 --> 00:57:04,570
it's the medium.

1894
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:09,250
We have no opportunity to do this before
it is the medium and it's also people

1895
00:57:09,251 --> 00:57:12,070
that don't feel like their
opinions are being heard.

1896
00:57:12,540 --> 00:57:14,080
Like they want their opinion to be heard.

1897
00:57:14,081 --> 00:57:15,160
They want it to be heard right now.

1898
00:57:15,161 --> 00:57:17,290
And it might not be a very
well thought out opinion,

1899
00:57:17,590 --> 00:57:20,050
but they know that they have
the ability to blare it out.

1900
00:57:20,220 --> 00:57:21,053
And so they

1901
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:24,040
just send it out and that,

1902
00:57:24,090 --> 00:57:24,430
that,

1903
00:57:24,430 --> 00:57:25,960
the ability to do that,

1904
00:57:25,961 --> 00:57:29,440
it's just intoxicating for
folks and they'll reach you.

1905
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:30,820
You talk about this with Jack.

1906
00:57:31,450 --> 00:57:32,283
There is a.

1907
00:57:32,540 --> 00:57:36,250
What makes twitter especially good for
this is that everything has the same

1908
00:57:36,251 --> 00:57:36,940
stature,

1909
00:57:36,940 --> 00:57:40,180
like your tweets no bigger than the other
tweet that just called you an asshole.

1910
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:41,740
That's my Kurt Metzger.

1911
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:44,740
Take on it because Kurt Metzger
was a hilarious standup comedian.

1912
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:45,401
He,

1913
00:57:45,401 --> 00:57:45,760
uh,

1914
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:47,740
he'll write a facebook blog only.

1915
00:57:47,860 --> 00:57:49,030
He only writes on facebook.

1916
00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:49,390
He's like,

1917
00:57:49,390 --> 00:57:51,100
I like how it's set up.

1918
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:51,810
He's like,

1919
00:57:51,810 --> 00:57:52,070
it's,

1920
00:57:52,070 --> 00:57:52,903
there's a big.

1921
00:57:53,190 --> 00:57:57,250
It differentiates between me and these
fucking idiots who are commenting under

1922
00:57:57,251 --> 00:57:58,510
there have.

1923
00:57:58,540 --> 00:57:59,321
Although ironically,

1924
00:57:59,321 --> 00:58:00,190
I hate facebook.

1925
00:58:00,191 --> 00:58:00,820
I can't even,

1926
00:58:00,820 --> 00:58:03,370
I mean just the graphic
design on facebook,

1927
00:58:03,371 --> 00:58:06,040
I find so offensive that I
can't even look at facebook.

1928
00:58:06,670 --> 00:58:08,350
So I use it as a publishing channel.

1929
00:58:08,351 --> 00:58:08,790
But I,

1930
00:58:08,790 --> 00:58:09,011
you know,

1931
00:58:09,011 --> 00:58:12,190
I keep threatening in my own mind to
just delete the account because I just

1932
00:58:12,191 --> 00:58:13,020
don't.

1933
00:58:13,020 --> 00:58:16,590
I've only read the comments
three times maybe ever read them.

1934
00:58:16,591 --> 00:58:17,770
It's like choose Christ.

1935
00:58:17,771 --> 00:58:18,610
It's like youtube,

1936
00:58:18,611 --> 00:58:19,570
but alive.

1937
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,130
I know it's like youtube,

1938
00:58:21,131 --> 00:58:22,810
but with people with their real names,

1939
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:25,590
it's,

1940
00:58:25,590 --> 00:58:25,990
you know,

1941
00:58:25,990 --> 00:58:28,550
this is a new world that
we're living in man,

1942
00:58:28,551 --> 00:58:31,510
and everybody's trying to navigate
this thing and figure it out as it goes

1943
00:58:31,511 --> 00:58:31,961
along.

1944
00:58:31,961 --> 00:58:33,670
And not everybody's doing it well.

1945
00:58:34,150 --> 00:58:34,900
And uh,

1946
00:58:34,900 --> 00:58:38,080
I think this world is going to
get more and more intrusive.

1947
00:58:38,081 --> 00:58:39,490
I think this is just the beginning.

1948
00:58:39,491 --> 00:58:41,230
I think we didn't see twitter coming,

1949
00:58:41,231 --> 00:58:42,370
whatever comes after twitter.

1950
00:58:42,371 --> 00:58:43,300
And this is one of the things that I,

1951
00:58:43,900 --> 00:58:48,370
before the podcast I wanted to really
talk to jack about to get his take on what

1952
00:58:48,371 --> 00:58:51,370
he thinks is next down the line because
there's going to be something that's

1953
00:58:51,371 --> 00:58:52,180
more invasive.

1954
00:58:52,180 --> 00:58:53,710
It's going to be something that is more,

1955
00:58:53,711 --> 00:58:54,520
whether it's a,

1956
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:57,430
I think probably something in
the line of augmented reality.

1957
00:58:57,880 --> 00:59:02,880
There were probably a decade away from
something that makes this look like books

1958
00:59:03,460 --> 00:59:04,031
look like,

1959
00:59:04,031 --> 00:59:04,470
you know,

1960
00:59:04,470 --> 00:59:07,090
a fucking corkboard at a bookstore.

1961
00:59:07,750 --> 00:59:09,760
Although strangely we're live.

1962
00:59:09,820 --> 00:59:11,830
We're living through the
golden age of audio here.

1963
00:59:11,860 --> 00:59:15,880
It's like we went full into video
and we're poised to go like,

1964
00:59:15,900 --> 00:59:16,130
you know,

1965
00:59:16,130 --> 00:59:18,460
three d and Vr.

1966
00:59:18,910 --> 00:59:21,410
And then all of a sudden audio is king.

1967
00:59:21,470 --> 00:59:21,591
Well,

1968
00:59:21,591 --> 00:59:22,970
how about phone calls and texts?

1969
00:59:23,150 --> 00:59:25,670
Like I remember I called you out
of the blue ones and it was like,

1970
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:28,130
what the fuck what you

1971
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:30,830
walk into a supermarket.

1972
00:59:31,610 --> 00:59:33,320
Somebody said on twitter once.

1973
00:59:33,321 --> 00:59:34,041
It was hilarious.

1974
00:59:34,041 --> 00:59:37,900
That facetiming face
timing me out of nowhere.

1975
00:59:37,910 --> 00:59:42,910
It just like knocking on my door
without calling me straight up.

1976
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:46,460
She was angry that
somebody face timed her.

1977
00:59:46,870 --> 00:59:47,060
No,

1978
00:59:47,060 --> 00:59:50,510
it always feels like an
old school move to my book.

1979
00:59:50,511 --> 00:59:54,140
Agent calls me out of the blue
and it's just seems so old.

1980
00:59:54,470 --> 00:59:55,910
It is just like a knock on the door.

1981
00:59:55,940 --> 00:59:59,270
My friend Joey Diaz only
calls only for years.

1982
00:59:59,271 --> 01:00:01,130
He would scream at you if you text.

1983
01:00:01,310 --> 01:00:04,250
And then recently within the last two
or three years you started texting

1984
01:00:04,251 --> 01:00:05,084
occasionally.

1985
01:00:05,260 --> 01:00:06,350
But he only calls.

1986
01:00:07,220 --> 01:00:11,150
Well I gotta I gotTa tell you I haven't
released this meditation APP has given

1987
01:00:11,151 --> 01:00:14,870
me a kind of a sanity check
on everything else I'm doing.

1988
01:00:14,900 --> 01:00:18,470
Which is very interesting
because in releasing the APP,

1989
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:19,450
you know,

1990
01:00:19,450 --> 01:00:22,970
it's like it's firewalled from all the
other controversial stuff I'm doing.

1991
01:00:23,010 --> 01:00:23,211
I'm like,

1992
01:00:23,211 --> 01:00:24,470
I'm not in the APP,

1993
01:00:24,471 --> 01:00:26,450
I'm not whinging about trump or you know,

1994
01:00:26,750 --> 01:00:31,750
talking about any of the stuff I talk
about on my podcast is just me trying to

1995
01:00:31,851 --> 01:00:36,710
teach meditation as a largely
as an antidote to all of
this stuff we're talking

1996
01:00:36,711 --> 01:00:36,921
about.

1997
01:00:36,921 --> 01:00:38,260
It's like we've got,

1998
01:00:38,270 --> 01:00:42,200
this is Tristan Harris says we've got
the slot machine in our pocket that is

1999
01:00:42,260 --> 01:00:47,260
continually gaming our attention all day
long and in my view a meditation app is

2000
01:00:48,741 --> 01:00:53,000
like the one thing you can have on your
smartphone that completely subverts the

2001
01:00:53,001 --> 01:00:58,001
technology and you can get you to actually
live a more examined life using the

2002
01:00:58,641 --> 01:00:59,474
technology.

2003
01:01:00,140 --> 01:01:05,140
But what's been amazing for me personally
is that I put it out and it is the

2004
01:01:05,811 --> 01:01:10,811
only thing that I have put out maybe
ever right where it has been received

2005
01:01:12,680 --> 01:01:14,270
exactly as I've intended.

2006
01:01:14,450 --> 01:01:14,661
Right?

2007
01:01:14,661 --> 01:01:15,890
There's no controversy.

2008
01:01:15,950 --> 01:01:16,530
It's just like,

2009
01:01:16,530 --> 01:01:18,260
like the people who are finding it useful,

2010
01:01:18,680 --> 01:01:20,210
love it and they say thank you,

2011
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:21,141
and it's like they're,

2012
01:01:21,141 --> 01:01:21,361
they're,

2013
01:01:21,361 --> 01:01:25,370
they're getting exactly what I thought
I was putting into it and it's like,

2014
01:01:25,710 --> 01:01:26,840
it made me think,

2015
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:31,370
what the hell am I doing over here with
all of this toxic stuff that has been

2016
01:01:31,371 --> 01:01:31,940
endlessly,

2017
01:01:31,940 --> 01:01:36,320
endlessly maliciously spawn against
me and misunderstood and you know,

2018
01:01:36,340 --> 01:01:36,660
was just,

2019
01:01:36,660 --> 01:01:36,930
man,

2020
01:01:36,930 --> 01:01:37,763
I have to,

2021
01:01:37,970 --> 01:01:41,360
I have to do both because there's a lot
of important things to talk about that

2022
01:01:41,361 --> 01:01:42,870
are going to be endlessly spawn and,

2023
01:01:42,871 --> 01:01:43,440
and malicious.

2024
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:43,770
Slandered,

2025
01:01:43,770 --> 01:01:44,361
misunderstood.

2026
01:01:44,361 --> 01:01:45,800
But it is,

2027
01:01:45,890 --> 01:01:48,470
it's been so refreshing to have one thing.

2028
01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:50,030
I mean you must get this with,

2029
01:01:50,080 --> 01:01:50,450
with,

2030
01:01:50,450 --> 01:01:50,680
you know,

2031
01:01:50,680 --> 01:01:51,660
you're doing your standup or,

2032
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:53,660
or maybe I don't have a thing.

2033
01:01:54,290 --> 01:01:55,430
I get shit for everything.

2034
01:01:55,460 --> 01:01:55,640
Okay.

2035
01:01:55,640 --> 01:01:56,750
But well maybe.

2036
01:01:56,780 --> 01:01:58,010
Maybe UFC commentary.

2037
01:01:58,760 --> 01:02:00,650
They come after me for everything.

2038
01:02:00,680 --> 01:02:02,530
Well he is just,

2039
01:02:02,660 --> 01:02:07,280
it has been psychologically it's been a
revelation to have one thing that I can

2040
01:02:07,281 --> 01:02:09,560
put out that is just,

2041
01:02:09,620 --> 01:02:12,650
it's just received appreciated.

2042
01:02:13,070 --> 01:02:15,230
And they got what I
intended and it's just,

2043
01:02:15,231 --> 01:02:15,650
you know,

2044
01:02:15,650 --> 01:02:16,170
thank you.

2045
01:02:16,170 --> 01:02:17,060
It's just like,

2046
01:02:17,061 --> 01:02:17,481
oh fuck,

2047
01:02:17,481 --> 01:02:18,260
that's possible.

2048
01:02:18,260 --> 01:02:19,620
I had no idea I had.

2049
01:02:20,580 --> 01:02:24,300
If I ever knew I had forgotten
that that w that was possible.

2050
01:02:24,330 --> 01:02:24,570
Well,

2051
01:02:24,570 --> 01:02:27,330
meditation now it kind of makes sense
because the people who are going to flock

2052
01:02:27,331 --> 01:02:28,620
to that are looking to meditate.

2053
01:02:28,621 --> 01:02:29,670
They're looking to improve their mind.

2054
01:02:29,671 --> 01:02:32,010
They're not looking to
spew hatred on facebook.

2055
01:02:32,080 --> 01:02:32,913
No.

2056
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:36,540
I thought that after
the podcast with Jack,

2057
01:02:36,541 --> 01:02:36,841
I was like,

2058
01:02:36,841 --> 01:02:37,430
Jesus Christ,

2059
01:02:37,430 --> 01:02:41,040
I should just stick to podcast with
comics because podcast with comics,

2060
01:02:41,041 --> 01:02:42,480
even if you put your foot in your mouth,

2061
01:02:42,481 --> 01:02:43,800
everybody knows you're
just trying to be funny.

2062
01:02:43,900 --> 01:02:44,560
Right.

2063
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:47,880
You know if you do a podcast and and
the thing about the podcast with Jack,

2064
01:02:47,881 --> 01:02:48,301
it's not even,

2065
01:02:48,301 --> 01:02:49,770
like I said anything bad,

2066
01:02:49,771 --> 01:02:53,460
it's what I didn't say that that
was upsetting to so many people,

2067
01:02:53,461 --> 01:02:57,780
but that's such a loaded thing
and because of that podcast,

2068
01:02:58,050 --> 01:03:00,330
now there's negative to it that blow back.

2069
01:03:00,331 --> 01:03:03,060
There's a lot of toxic anger and all that,

2070
01:03:03,061 --> 01:03:05,760
but the positive is what I like.

2071
01:03:06,090 --> 01:03:11,090
The positive that came out of it is me
forced to reexamine how I do podcast,

2072
01:03:11,121 --> 01:03:15,330
reexamined the significance of each
individual guests and especially someone

2073
01:03:15,331 --> 01:03:17,450
that comes with as much baggage know,

2074
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:19,290
without lack of a better term,

2075
01:03:19,350 --> 01:03:22,500
a as Jack that you're,

2076
01:03:22,710 --> 01:03:23,250
you know,

2077
01:03:23,250 --> 01:03:26,880
you gotta think that there's people
listening and there's some questions that

2078
01:03:26,881 --> 01:03:28,500
you really have to work at.

2079
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:29,341
You have to,

2080
01:03:29,341 --> 01:03:30,810
you have to push through and even if he's,

2081
01:03:31,130 --> 01:03:32,670
he's dancing and peer wedding,

2082
01:03:33,060 --> 01:03:33,990
I should've went back to,

2083
01:03:33,991 --> 01:03:34,510
okay,

2084
01:03:34,510 --> 01:03:36,480
why is Kathy Griffin on your platform?

2085
01:03:36,810 --> 01:03:37,980
Like if doxing is bad,

2086
01:03:37,981 --> 01:03:38,251
you want,

2087
01:03:38,251 --> 01:03:38,990
you don't want to docs,

2088
01:03:38,990 --> 01:03:40,020
you don't want threats of violence.

2089
01:03:40,260 --> 01:03:41,220
When someone says,

2090
01:03:41,670 --> 01:03:42,690
I want names,

2091
01:03:43,290 --> 01:03:43,471
okay,

2092
01:03:43,471 --> 01:03:44,790
what are you going to do
with these fucking names?

2093
01:03:45,120 --> 01:03:45,930
What are you gonna do with them?

2094
01:03:45,930 --> 01:03:48,900
What are you gonna do with a 16 year old
kid and his names and then when you see

2095
01:03:48,901 --> 01:03:49,770
the actual,

2096
01:03:49,890 --> 01:03:54,000
the actual video of what actually happened
and there's so many people that are

2097
01:03:54,001 --> 01:03:57,810
still not walking it back
still no doubling down.

2098
01:03:57,840 --> 01:03:58,900
A lot of people doubled down.

2099
01:03:58,930 --> 01:03:59,670
Fuck him.

2100
01:03:59,670 --> 01:04:01,590
And here's another
little piece of insight.

2101
01:04:02,250 --> 01:04:05,940
My friend Matt lived in DC and those hats,

2102
01:04:05,970 --> 01:04:06,850
those magazines,

2103
01:04:06,950 --> 01:04:08,130
they're fucking everywhere.

2104
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:10,260
There's these little where
these kids were that area.

2105
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:12,690
There's these carts that sell these hats,

2106
01:04:12,930 --> 01:04:15,180
so these kids bought those hats that day.

2107
01:04:15,210 --> 01:04:17,370
It's not like they're these mag a kids.

2108
01:04:17,490 --> 01:04:19,580
They'd probably just be
an assholes right there,

2109
01:04:19,590 --> 01:04:21,750
unsupervised teenage boys.

2110
01:04:22,020 --> 01:04:25,950
Their frontal lobe is not fully formed
and they're all together feeding off each

2111
01:04:25,951 --> 01:04:27,060
other like a pack of Gremlins.

2112
01:04:27,510 --> 01:04:28,860
I was a teenage boy.

2113
01:04:28,861 --> 01:04:29,850
You were a teenage boy.

2114
01:04:29,851 --> 01:04:31,790
You know how fucking stupid used to be.

2115
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:32,560
I mean,

2116
01:04:32,560 --> 01:04:34,050
I was probably way more stupid than you,

2117
01:04:34,230 --> 01:04:35,550
but I was a mess.

2118
01:04:35,560 --> 01:04:40,560
I had my moments now it'd be just you
get 100 teenage boys together in a crowd,

2119
01:04:41,940 --> 01:04:42,180
you know,

2120
01:04:42,180 --> 01:04:46,920
on a school trip and you get some native
elder drumming in one of the in some

2121
01:04:46,921 --> 01:04:47,754
guys face.

2122
01:04:48,450 --> 01:04:50,370
It was amazing what didn't happen.

2123
01:04:50,850 --> 01:04:51,460
Exactly.

2124
01:04:51,460 --> 01:04:52,640
No violence,

2125
01:04:52,760 --> 01:04:53,181
no violence,

2126
01:04:53,181 --> 01:04:53,900
and no.

2127
01:04:53,900 --> 01:04:54,631
The way he handled it.

2128
01:04:54,631 --> 01:04:54,751
Oh,

2129
01:04:54,751 --> 01:04:55,584
you did a smile.

2130
01:04:56,440 --> 01:04:57,840
So listen,

2131
01:04:57,841 --> 01:05:02,841
I'm as biased as anyone against a Catholic
school kid wearing a Maga hat given.

2132
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:06,030
Given my backstory is like,

2133
01:05:06,031 --> 01:05:06,181
yeah,

2134
01:05:06,181 --> 01:05:07,350
I'm totally poised.

2135
01:05:07,351 --> 01:05:10,200
I think this guy's an asshole and
this likely always to be an asshole.

2136
01:05:10,830 --> 01:05:15,390
But what people read into
an uncomfortable smile,

2137
01:05:15,510 --> 01:05:15,811
right?

2138
01:05:15,811 --> 01:05:15,961
I mean,

2139
01:05:15,961 --> 01:05:16,530
just like the,

2140
01:05:16,530 --> 01:05:17,110
the,

2141
01:05:17,110 --> 01:05:17,980
the shots

2142
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:20,620
of his face with the tweets that said,

2143
01:05:20,980 --> 01:05:21,221
you know,

2144
01:05:21,221 --> 01:05:23,230
this is what white privilege looks like.

2145
01:05:23,231 --> 01:05:23,540
This is,

2146
01:05:23,540 --> 01:05:23,780
you know,

2147
01:05:23,780 --> 01:05:24,121
this is,

2148
01:05:24,121 --> 01:05:24,681
this is the,

2149
01:05:24,681 --> 01:05:26,140
everything that's wrong in our society.

2150
01:05:26,440 --> 01:05:27,273
It's just,

2151
01:05:27,580 --> 01:05:29,230
we have to slow down.

2152
01:05:29,260 --> 01:05:30,100
How about raise road?

2153
01:05:30,130 --> 01:05:31,500
If you ever seen a more entrepreneur,

2154
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:32,353
punchable face,

2155
01:05:32,560 --> 01:05:33,251
come on man.

2156
01:05:33,251 --> 01:05:37,310
You want to punch him because he's
smiling with his me started on,

2157
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:37,630
uh,

2158
01:05:37,630 --> 01:05:42,630
calls for violence from the left are
so fucking disturbing to me because my

2159
01:05:42,671 --> 01:05:44,260
parents were hippies when I grew up.

2160
01:05:44,261 --> 01:05:46,810
I always thought of
the left and we always,

2161
01:05:46,811 --> 01:05:47,980
I've been called,

2162
01:05:47,981 --> 01:05:48,161
right?

2163
01:05:48,161 --> 01:05:51,580
We have never voted anything
but democratic in my life
except for Gary Johnson.

2164
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,760
Gary Johnson was the only time I voted
independent or whatever the fuck he was

2165
01:05:54,761 --> 01:05:55,594
libertarian.

2166
01:05:56,110 --> 01:05:56,651
But that was just [inaudible].

2167
01:05:56,651 --> 01:05:57,484
He did my podcast.

2168
01:05:57,930 --> 01:06:00,700
I've often Tulsi Gavin
because he did my podcast,

2169
01:06:01,240 --> 01:06:02,073
but the,

2170
01:06:02,460 --> 01:06:02,940
the,

2171
01:06:02,940 --> 01:06:03,230
the,

2172
01:06:03,230 --> 01:06:06,360
the left was always very considerate.

2173
01:06:06,760 --> 01:06:07,900
Well read.

2174
01:06:08,110 --> 01:06:08,621
They were,

2175
01:06:08,621 --> 01:06:11,170
there were the people
that were more openminded,

2176
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:15,100
there were supporting of gay people and
minorities that was the left and then

2177
01:06:15,101 --> 01:06:15,934
were nonviolent.

2178
01:06:15,940 --> 01:06:18,400
They were the people that are
protesting Vietnam when I was a kid.

2179
01:06:18,510 --> 01:06:23,510
Also just supportive of the virtue of
speech and free speech and self criticism.

2180
01:06:24,140 --> 01:06:24,800
Yes.

2181
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:25,490
I mean that the,

2182
01:06:25,490 --> 01:06:26,320
the,

2183
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:31,320
the disadvantage of the left against the
right has always been there's this self

2184
01:06:32,981 --> 01:06:37,300
scrutiny and willingness to
wonder whether or not I'm wrong,

2185
01:06:37,750 --> 01:06:40,030
that isn't mirrored if you go far enough.

2186
01:06:40,031 --> 01:06:40,420
Right.

2187
01:06:40,420 --> 01:06:42,010
And uh,

2188
01:06:42,370 --> 01:06:42,800
it has,

2189
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:43,250
there has been.

2190
01:06:43,250 --> 01:06:45,820
So there's been kind of an asymmetric
war between left and right,

2191
01:06:45,821 --> 01:06:46,001
you know,

2192
01:06:46,001 --> 01:06:46,834
politically from,

2193
01:06:46,930 --> 01:06:48,100
for much of our lifetime,

2194
01:06:48,130 --> 01:06:50,660
but you go far enough left now and you're,

2195
01:06:50,920 --> 01:06:55,920
you're meeting a kind of totalitarian
resistance to speech and it's.

2196
01:06:58,130 --> 01:06:58,351
Yeah,

2197
01:06:58,351 --> 01:06:58,811
it's very,

2198
01:06:58,811 --> 01:06:59,620
I mean I'm just,

2199
01:06:59,620 --> 01:07:00,890
it'll be interesting to see how the,

2200
01:07:01,710 --> 01:07:03,380
the 2020 campaign plays out,

2201
01:07:03,420 --> 01:07:08,420
but I'm certainly worried that we could
totally blow it with some leftist social

2202
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:10,230
new uprising.

2203
01:07:11,380 --> 01:07:11,621
Yeah.

2204
01:07:11,621 --> 01:07:13,810
That would be unfortunate because I
think they would just double down on the

2205
01:07:13,811 --> 01:07:14,320
other side.

2206
01:07:14,320 --> 01:07:16,780
We'd be better off with some
sort of a reasonable centrist,

2207
01:07:16,781 --> 01:07:17,080
right.

2208
01:07:17,080 --> 01:07:18,640
Someone who just made sense and,

2209
01:07:18,970 --> 01:07:19,301
you know,

2210
01:07:19,301 --> 01:07:22,390
one of the things that I liked about
Tulsi is that she's a veteran and,

2211
01:07:22,391 --> 01:07:23,224
you know,

2212
01:07:23,410 --> 01:07:24,070
she's,

2213
01:07:24,070 --> 01:07:25,660
she seems very reasonable to me,

2214
01:07:25,661 --> 01:07:30,661
but except that I haven't
followed her career closely,

2215
01:07:30,911 --> 01:07:35,530
but it just seems like she's not making
the right noises on things like Syria

2216
01:07:35,531 --> 01:07:38,530
and Assad and I don't know
enough about that to comment.

2217
01:07:38,700 --> 01:07:41,640
I don't know enough about Assad and the
controversy of whether or not he gassed

2218
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:42,510
is,

2219
01:07:42,510 --> 01:07:44,200
whether that is,

2220
01:07:44,201 --> 01:07:48,340
I think uncontroversial in terms of
what she mean that is uncontroversial.

2221
01:07:48,350 --> 01:07:51,250
Which in terms of what
she is saying about it,

2222
01:07:51,460 --> 01:07:52,220
about him.

2223
01:07:52,220 --> 01:07:52,381
I mean,

2224
01:07:52,381 --> 01:07:52,431
she,

2225
01:07:52,431 --> 01:07:56,550
she's capable of putting both feet in
her mouth on that and thought she's what

2226
01:07:56,680 --> 01:07:57,100
she's saying.

2227
01:07:57,100 --> 01:07:58,330
He's not an enemy of America.

2228
01:07:58,331 --> 01:07:58,600
Right.

2229
01:07:58,600 --> 01:07:58,990
So,

2230
01:07:58,990 --> 01:07:59,501
yeah,

2231
01:07:59,501 --> 01:07:59,920
I mean,

2232
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:00,341
again,

2233
01:08:00,341 --> 01:08:01,760
I'm not close enough to it and uh,

2234
01:08:02,320 --> 01:08:03,030
but I,

2235
01:08:03,030 --> 01:08:07,870
I would be very circumspect about
endorsing her going forward.

2236
01:08:07,871 --> 01:08:11,680
And we did do a little homework because
I think her candidacy is not going to

2237
01:08:11,681 --> 01:08:12,514
age well.

2238
01:08:13,190 --> 01:08:13,520
That's,

2239
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:14,310
uh,

2240
01:08:14,310 --> 01:08:15,143
that's my.

2241
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:17,270
Who makes sense to you?

2242
01:08:18,230 --> 01:08:19,510
Elizabeth Warren's fucked now.

2243
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:20,990
The most recent one,

2244
01:08:21,280 --> 01:08:22,790
she's got the most recent one for.

2245
01:08:22,791 --> 01:08:24,000
She filled out an application.

2246
01:08:24,030 --> 01:08:28,820
She wrote native American on a budget
just having done the DNA test is playing

2247
01:08:28,821 --> 01:08:30,110
that game with trump.

2248
01:08:30,170 --> 01:08:30,900
I mean that was,

2249
01:08:30,900 --> 01:08:32,540
that was such a miscalculation.

2250
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:32,841
Well,

2251
01:08:32,841 --> 01:08:35,720
the fact that she released the
data and the data's so clear.

2252
01:08:35,721 --> 01:08:40,040
Well it's almost like she had to because
otherwise he would call her pocahontas

2253
01:08:40,041 --> 01:08:40,761
to the end of time,

2254
01:08:40,761 --> 01:08:41,150
but that,

2255
01:08:41,150 --> 01:08:44,950
but then to then have to apologize to
native Americans for having done the

2256
01:08:44,990 --> 01:08:48,600
tablet just because the amount
of native American is so low.

2257
01:08:48,620 --> 01:08:52,700
I've been joking around about it than I
am like 100 times more African and she

2258
01:08:52,701 --> 01:08:53,534
is native American.

2259
01:08:53,900 --> 01:08:58,370
I'm one point six percent African and
she's less than like way less than one

2260
01:08:58,371 --> 01:08:59,420
percent native American.

2261
01:08:59,421 --> 01:08:59,631
Right.

2262
01:08:59,631 --> 01:09:00,020
But this,

2263
01:09:00,020 --> 01:09:00,340
these are,

2264
01:09:00,340 --> 01:09:04,400
this is the sort of masochistic death
spiral that people on the left can get

2265
01:09:04,401 --> 01:09:04,701
into.

2266
01:09:04,701 --> 01:09:08,450
It's like you're on the left and I've
always said that the left eats its own in

2267
01:09:08,451 --> 01:09:10,370
a way that the right never does.

2268
01:09:10,710 --> 01:09:11,543
It's just,

2269
01:09:11,810 --> 01:09:12,201
it's,

2270
01:09:12,201 --> 01:09:12,950
um,

2271
01:09:12,950 --> 01:09:17,950
we have to find someone who can stand
outside that the circular firing squad,

2272
01:09:19,370 --> 01:09:20,120
right?

2273
01:09:20,120 --> 01:09:20,480
Uh,

2274
01:09:20,480 --> 01:09:23,930
and it would be someone who's,

2275
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:25,071
you know,

2276
01:09:25,071 --> 01:09:25,610
it would be,

2277
01:09:25,610 --> 01:09:26,271
in my view,

2278
01:09:26,271 --> 01:09:27,290
would be somebody like a,

2279
01:09:27,650 --> 01:09:29,330
a younger Bloomberg,

2280
01:09:29,331 --> 01:09:29,481
right?

2281
01:09:29,481 --> 01:09:29,591
I mean,

2282
01:09:29,591 --> 01:09:30,020
I don't think it's,

2283
01:09:30,020 --> 01:09:30,860
I don't think it's Bloomberg,

2284
01:09:30,861 --> 01:09:31,670
but like somebody,

2285
01:09:31,670 --> 01:09:36,670
like a legit businessman who could call
bullshit on all of trump's fake business

2286
01:09:37,251 --> 01:09:41,210
acumen and who's not
ethically compromised.

2287
01:09:41,210 --> 01:09:41,421
Right?

2288
01:09:41,421 --> 01:09:41,900
But who can,

2289
01:09:41,900 --> 01:09:43,420
who can get stuff done and so,

2290
01:09:43,850 --> 01:09:44,683
and,

2291
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:50,000
and definitely not someone who feels the
need to pander to the far left on these

2292
01:09:51,770 --> 01:09:53,030
identity politics issues.

2293
01:09:53,130 --> 01:09:57,650
I think identity politics is really going
to be bad for us against trump because

2294
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:00,090
so much of the country,

2295
01:10:00,140 --> 01:10:02,420
the crucial sliver of the country.

2296
01:10:02,520 --> 01:10:07,200
And you just have to ask yourself who
was it who voted for Obama and then or

2297
01:10:07,220 --> 01:10:09,260
twice and then voted for trump.

2298
01:10:09,680 --> 01:10:10,460
Right?

2299
01:10:10,460 --> 01:10:11,750
Those people aren't racist,

2300
01:10:11,870 --> 01:10:12,230
right?

2301
01:10:12,230 --> 01:10:14,480
Those people are sick
of being called racist.

2302
01:10:14,540 --> 01:10:14,840
Right.

2303
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:15,740
And the,

2304
01:10:15,960 --> 01:10:19,910
what's happening on the left around
identity politics and all of these.

2305
01:10:20,200 --> 01:10:20,391
I mean,

2306
01:10:20,391 --> 01:10:22,220
it's not that racism isn't a problem,

2307
01:10:22,221 --> 01:10:26,690
is not that transgender issues don't have
to be worked out and be like all like

2308
01:10:26,691 --> 01:10:28,580
all of those are legit concerns,

2309
01:10:28,670 --> 01:10:33,350
but the fact that that's the center
of mass politically on the left,

2310
01:10:34,130 --> 01:10:34,880
in,

2311
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:38,030
in a nationwide election
against someone like trump.

2312
01:10:38,900 --> 01:10:43,480
I just think that's an absolute recipe
for disaster because the people that

2313
01:10:43,490 --> 01:10:46,940
subscribed to that ideology don't
realize how many people think it's silly.

2314
01:10:47,270 --> 01:10:47,660
Yeah.

2315
01:10:47,660 --> 01:10:48,290
You know,

2316
01:10:48,290 --> 01:10:52,100
when you're in the oppression Olympics
and you're trying to win the gold and for

2317
01:10:52,101 --> 01:10:54,470
and for how many people
it's actually misapplied.

2318
01:10:54,910 --> 01:10:56,310
It's like there,

2319
01:10:56,311 --> 01:11:01,311
there are many more explanations for
voting for trump in addition to racism.

2320
01:11:02,950 --> 01:11:03,783
But like,

2321
01:11:04,010 --> 01:11:04,251
yeah,

2322
01:11:04,251 --> 01:11:04,431
like,

2323
01:11:04,431 --> 01:11:04,850
yes,

2324
01:11:04,850 --> 01:11:06,620
every racist voted for trump,

2325
01:11:06,650 --> 01:11:06,980
you know,

2326
01:11:06,980 --> 01:11:07,760
virtually.

2327
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:08,780
So that's fine.

2328
01:11:08,781 --> 01:11:10,640
Every white supremacist voted for trump,

2329
01:11:11,090 --> 01:11:16,090
but that's not the story about why
trump got elected and song store.

2330
01:11:17,500 --> 01:11:19,260
It's just much more.

2331
01:11:19,261 --> 01:11:19,600
I mean,

2332
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:21,710
there's people who just have not,

2333
01:11:22,460 --> 01:11:23,293
um,

2334
01:11:24,110 --> 01:11:24,570
what do you mean?

2335
01:11:24,570 --> 01:11:27,610
Ours are not thriving in the
current economy and stuff like that.

2336
01:11:27,611 --> 01:11:30,750
You got automation displacing
manufacturing jobs.

2337
01:11:30,751 --> 01:11:33,150
You got the consequences
of trade and immigration.

2338
01:11:33,180 --> 01:11:34,013
And,

2339
01:11:34,270 --> 01:11:34,560
uh,

2340
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:36,600
you have legitimate concerns about,

2341
01:11:37,250 --> 01:11:38,083
uh,

2342
01:11:38,550 --> 01:11:39,270
you have a legit,

2343
01:11:39,270 --> 01:11:43,020
there are legitimate concerns about
immigration that have nothing to do with

2344
01:11:43,021 --> 01:11:43,650
racism.

2345
01:11:43,650 --> 01:11:48,650
And so if you're going to
score any hesitation over
something like open borders

2346
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:52,740
as a sign of your xenophobia and racism,

2347
01:11:53,340 --> 01:11:57,000
you're going to lose virtually everyone
who has a sane concern about how to,

2348
01:11:57,060 --> 01:11:58,890
how you keep people in,

2349
01:11:59,090 --> 01:11:59,410
how you,

2350
01:11:59,410 --> 01:12:01,620
how you admit the right
people into a country,

2351
01:12:01,830 --> 01:12:02,663
right?

2352
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:03,301
I mean,

2353
01:12:03,301 --> 01:12:05,640
there are economic concerns
and there are social concerns.

2354
01:12:05,641 --> 01:12:06,474
And,

2355
01:12:07,020 --> 01:12:07,853
uh,

2356
01:12:08,280 --> 01:12:08,491
yeah,

2357
01:12:08,491 --> 01:12:08,791
I mean,

2358
01:12:08,791 --> 01:12:12,240
and you don't have to be Ben Shapiro
to share some of those concerns.

2359
01:12:12,241 --> 01:12:12,431
Right?

2360
01:12:12,431 --> 01:12:13,890
And I'm not saying bench appears racist,

2361
01:12:13,891 --> 01:12:15,330
obviously I'm saying he's a conservative,

2362
01:12:15,590 --> 01:12:16,200
uh,

2363
01:12:16,200 --> 01:12:16,651
and you know,

2364
01:12:16,651 --> 01:12:18,120
take some more conservative line on,

2365
01:12:18,210 --> 01:12:19,980
on many of these questions than I do,

2366
01:12:20,490 --> 01:12:21,850
but you know,

2367
01:12:22,190 --> 01:12:23,023
it's like,

2368
01:12:23,540 --> 01:12:25,020
you either you either think,

2369
01:12:25,310 --> 01:12:27,270
but just take immigration
is the narrow case.

2370
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:33,080
You either think you should be able to
know who's coming into the country or you

2371
01:12:33,121 --> 01:12:34,170
don't right now,

2372
01:12:34,171 --> 01:12:34,471
if you,

2373
01:12:34,471 --> 01:12:36,570
if you think you should
just have open borders,

2374
01:12:37,230 --> 01:12:38,063
uh,

2375
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:39,450
there are two problems with that.

2376
01:12:39,450 --> 01:12:43,500
One is there are many good
arguments against that and to,

2377
01:12:45,330 --> 01:12:46,380
I don't know what the percentage is,

2378
01:12:46,381 --> 01:12:50,520
but it's got to be something like 95
percent of Americans would be terrified at

2379
01:12:50,521 --> 01:12:51,270
that prospect.

2380
01:12:51,270 --> 01:12:51,451
Right?

2381
01:12:51,451 --> 01:12:51,810
So if you're,

2382
01:12:51,810 --> 01:12:51,980
if,

2383
01:12:51,980 --> 01:12:55,760
if any of your platform
is essentially saying it,

2384
01:12:55,761 --> 01:12:58,470
concerned about immigration
is synonymous with racism,

2385
01:12:59,100 --> 01:12:59,371
you know,

2386
01:12:59,371 --> 01:13:03,600
you have a platform that is going to
alienate most people and that's what the

2387
01:13:03,601 --> 01:13:07,110
Democrats are totally
capable of seeming like that.

2388
01:13:07,111 --> 01:13:08,040
Whether in fact that's,

2389
01:13:08,450 --> 01:13:10,500
that's true for most Democrats.

2390
01:13:10,620 --> 01:13:12,330
What do you think is,

2391
01:13:12,510 --> 01:13:15,180
what's the primary factor like what,

2392
01:13:15,181 --> 01:13:19,440
what caused identity politics through
reached this boiling point that it's at

2393
01:13:19,441 --> 01:13:20,274
right now?

2394
01:13:21,390 --> 01:13:21,601
Well,

2395
01:13:21,601 --> 01:13:22,291
it is.

2396
01:13:22,291 --> 01:13:26,520
I think in large measure what
the Internet is doing to us,

2397
01:13:26,521 --> 01:13:27,331
it's not that identity.

2398
01:13:27,331 --> 01:13:31,740
Politics has been a feature
of politics for forever,

2399
01:13:31,770 --> 01:13:33,720
but there is a,

2400
01:13:33,750 --> 01:13:35,130
there's the silo effect.

2401
01:13:35,160 --> 01:13:40,160
There's the effect that groups become
more radicalized the as groups because the

2402
01:13:42,511 --> 01:13:45,180
most extreme voices tend to,

2403
01:13:45,250 --> 01:13:46,920
to pipe up more and then and,

2404
01:13:46,950 --> 01:13:48,030
and everyone.

2405
01:13:48,750 --> 01:13:50,490
Everyone who's who is silent.

2406
01:13:50,491 --> 01:13:50,611
I mean,

2407
01:13:50,611 --> 01:13:52,920
there's kind of a diffusion
of responsibility around,

2408
01:13:53,500 --> 01:13:55,350
around countering these extreme voices,

2409
01:13:55,351 --> 01:13:55,581
like a,

2410
01:13:55,581 --> 01:13:55,771
you know,

2411
01:13:55,771 --> 01:13:56,581
every you can,

2412
01:13:56,581 --> 01:14:01,581
it only takes a small
percentage of extreme voices
to cow the rest of the group

2413
01:14:04,210 --> 01:14:04,640
and,

2414
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:08,610
and make the group seem like the extreme
voices are speaking for the group,

2415
01:14:09,020 --> 01:14:09,291
you know,

2416
01:14:09,291 --> 01:14:09,471
and,

2417
01:14:09,471 --> 01:14:13,090
and so I think what we have
on in the left and the right,

2418
01:14:13,810 --> 01:14:15,400
we have a small percentage.

2419
01:14:15,401 --> 01:14:15,591
I mean,

2420
01:14:15,591 --> 01:14:15,671
uh,

2421
01:14:15,671 --> 01:14:16,330
you know,

2422
01:14:16,330 --> 01:14:19,360
the last poll I saw that trying to get
at this question was something like,

2423
01:14:19,361 --> 01:14:19,510
you know,

2424
01:14:19,510 --> 01:14:24,510
six or eight percent on the tails that
are making it seem like these are,

2425
01:14:25,250 --> 01:14:25,840
I think it's,

2426
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:29,050
I think it's more of a problem on the
left than on the right because I mean,

2427
01:14:29,051 --> 01:14:33,700
the extreme right stay is
fringe and looks fringe,

2428
01:14:33,730 --> 01:14:33,940
right?

2429
01:14:33,940 --> 01:14:34,580
Like the guy,

2430
01:14:34,580 --> 01:14:35,830
the guys in Charlottesville,

2431
01:14:36,160 --> 01:14:37,480
Charlottesville with their Tiki torches,

2432
01:14:37,900 --> 01:14:41,200
they don't look like they represent
the Republican Party or the,

2433
01:14:41,201 --> 01:14:41,920
or the,

2434
01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:42,311
the,

2435
01:14:42,311 --> 01:14:43,144
um,

2436
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:43,810
the right,

2437
01:14:43,810 --> 01:14:46,210
the conservatives in any general sense.

2438
01:14:46,680 --> 01:14:47,420
Um,

2439
01:14:47,420 --> 01:14:48,790
there are a symptom of some problem,

2440
01:14:48,791 --> 01:14:50,140
but it's a smaller problem.

2441
01:14:50,141 --> 01:14:51,160
It's a minority problem.

2442
01:14:51,161 --> 01:14:52,240
Whereas on the left,

2443
01:14:52,990 --> 01:14:55,870
the extreme voices are,

2444
01:14:55,990 --> 01:15:00,820
have massive sway in major
companies in tech companies,

2445
01:15:00,821 --> 01:15:01,780
in journalism,

2446
01:15:01,781 --> 01:15:02,620
in academia,

2447
01:15:02,650 --> 01:15:02,861
like,

2448
01:15:02,861 --> 01:15:07,861
like the silencing effect
and the reputational cost
that's being paid by even

2449
01:15:07,931 --> 01:15:12,850
very powerful people in all these
mainstream forums on the left is,

2450
01:15:12,940 --> 01:15:13,773
is just,

2451
01:15:14,350 --> 01:15:16,420
that's not mirrored on the right,

2452
01:15:16,470 --> 01:15:17,303
you know,

2453
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:18,281
and it's.

2454
01:15:18,281 --> 01:15:18,451
I mean,

2455
01:15:18,451 --> 01:15:20,950
so I don't know if I told you this,

2456
01:15:21,850 --> 01:15:23,560
I'm certainly didn't say it on a,

2457
01:15:23,561 --> 01:15:24,670
on a previous podcast with you,

2458
01:15:24,671 --> 01:15:25,250
but,

2459
01:15:25,250 --> 01:15:25,541
so it was,

2460
01:15:25,541 --> 01:15:29,410
I was at dinner with a bunch of Silicon
Valley people and we were talking about,

2461
01:15:29,411 --> 01:15:29,730
I,

2462
01:15:29,730 --> 01:15:30,450
I was,

2463
01:15:30,450 --> 01:15:31,900
it was at the moment when that,

2464
01:15:32,890 --> 01:15:35,620
that Netflix story happened where the,

2465
01:15:35,621 --> 01:15:36,454
um,

2466
01:15:36,970 --> 01:15:40,240
where Jonathan Friedland got fired
over using the n word in a closed door

2467
01:15:40,241 --> 01:15:40,840
meeting.

2468
01:15:40,840 --> 01:15:41,830
And it was,

2469
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:42,191
it was,

2470
01:15:42,191 --> 01:15:42,580
uh,

2471
01:15:42,580 --> 01:15:45,180
using the n word in response to
my friend Tom Segura who you.

2472
01:15:45,520 --> 01:15:45,910
Oh yeah,

2473
01:15:45,910 --> 01:15:46,151
right.

2474
01:15:46,151 --> 01:15:46,890
Exactly.

2475
01:15:46,890 --> 01:15:47,723
Special.

2476
01:15:47,750 --> 01:15:51,550
Where he said you can't
say retarded anymore.

2477
01:15:51,810 --> 01:15:53,650
And then explained like that,

2478
01:15:53,680 --> 01:15:53,951
you know,

2479
01:15:53,951 --> 01:15:55,320
there's words you can't use anymore.

2480
01:15:55,370 --> 01:15:57,730
I didn't even wasn't using it in a joke,

2481
01:15:57,731 --> 01:16:00,370
like calling someone retarded
or saying something's retarded,

2482
01:16:00,610 --> 01:16:01,810
but they were in,

2483
01:16:01,811 --> 01:16:04,040
he was saying that that's like
using the envelope around.

2484
01:16:04,180 --> 01:16:04,620
Yeah.

2485
01:16:04,620 --> 01:16:06,520
But he used the n word in this meeting,

2486
01:16:06,521 --> 01:16:06,710
right.

2487
01:16:06,710 --> 01:16:10,610
And it says like using the n word and the,

2488
01:16:10,680 --> 01:16:11,350
just the,

2489
01:16:11,350 --> 01:16:11,531
the,

2490
01:16:11,531 --> 01:16:14,950
the mere intonation of those
syllables was so shocking.

2491
01:16:15,190 --> 01:16:16,023
Right?

2492
01:16:16,120 --> 01:16:16,750
Uh,

2493
01:16:16,750 --> 01:16:18,850
that he wound up getting fired.

2494
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:19,211
Right.

2495
01:16:19,211 --> 01:16:19,331
And,

2496
01:16:19,331 --> 01:16:19,840
and again,

2497
01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:20,260
he was,

2498
01:16:20,260 --> 01:16:24,520
he was using it in the
context of expressing just
how careful netflix has to be

2499
01:16:24,521 --> 01:16:29,440
about speech and he was going social
justice warrior on himself among social

2500
01:16:29,441 --> 01:16:30,340
justice warriors.

2501
01:16:30,790 --> 01:16:33,520
And he said this is how
worried we have to be.

2502
01:16:33,850 --> 01:16:35,890
And that it gave a magic incantation.

2503
01:16:35,891 --> 01:16:37,540
You can still say retarded,

2504
01:16:37,541 --> 01:16:39,520
which is amazing because it's stiff.

2505
01:16:39,810 --> 01:16:40,270
I mean,

2506
01:16:40,270 --> 01:16:42,970
in his defense you kind
of have to say both words.

2507
01:16:43,240 --> 01:16:44,800
You're not saying the R word,

2508
01:16:44,850 --> 01:16:45,250
right?

2509
01:16:45,250 --> 01:16:46,610
Like using the r word is,

2510
01:16:46,611 --> 01:16:46,651
uh,

2511
01:16:46,651 --> 01:16:48,490
like using the n word around black people.

2512
01:16:48,500 --> 01:16:52,920
More getting to some weird
fucking weird place with this.

2513
01:16:52,990 --> 01:16:53,261
Actually,

2514
01:16:53,261 --> 01:16:53,500
no.

2515
01:16:53,500 --> 01:16:56,320
Now I'm realized why I'm confused about
why I think I've talked about this

2516
01:16:56,321 --> 01:16:59,680
because I did a podcast
with Chelsea handler,

2517
01:17:00,010 --> 01:17:00,841
which hasn't aired,

2518
01:17:00,841 --> 01:17:01,050
I mean,

2519
01:17:01,050 --> 01:17:01,900
did it months ago,

2520
01:17:02,150 --> 01:17:02,980
um,

2521
01:17:02,980 --> 01:17:05,800
because she was doing a documentary
on white privilege I think.

2522
01:17:05,801 --> 01:17:05,981
And I,

2523
01:17:05,981 --> 01:17:09,320
I think I'm actually cast as the guy with
white privilege and this documentary.

2524
01:17:09,370 --> 01:17:09,720
Boy,

2525
01:17:09,720 --> 01:17:10,310
that's going to be fun.

2526
01:17:10,310 --> 01:17:11,121
You have white privilege.

2527
01:17:11,121 --> 01:17:11,480
Yeah.

2528
01:17:11,480 --> 01:17:11,870
Nice.

2529
01:17:11,870 --> 01:17:12,261
So,

2530
01:17:12,261 --> 01:17:13,094
um,

2531
01:17:13,100 --> 01:17:13,310
uh,

2532
01:17:13,310 --> 01:17:13,690
but I,

2533
01:17:13,690 --> 01:17:15,020
I recorded a podcast with her.

2534
01:17:15,020 --> 01:17:15,501
So anyway,

2535
01:17:15,501 --> 01:17:18,860
so we hit this point because
this had just come out,

2536
01:17:18,990 --> 01:17:19,370
uh,

2537
01:17:19,370 --> 01:17:19,761
then.

2538
01:17:19,761 --> 01:17:21,890
And I think her documentary
is probably for Netflix.

2539
01:17:22,460 --> 01:17:24,170
So what was her take on it?

2540
01:17:25,130 --> 01:17:25,251
Well,

2541
01:17:25,251 --> 01:17:25,760
she was,

2542
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:26,750
she was basically,

2543
01:17:26,751 --> 01:17:29,420
I mean she was playing the
other side of the net for this,

2544
01:17:29,421 --> 01:17:29,810
you know,

2545
01:17:29,810 --> 01:17:30,630
and you know,

2546
01:17:30,630 --> 01:17:31,140
not,

2547
01:17:31,140 --> 01:17:31,973
um,

2548
01:17:32,150 --> 01:17:32,361
we'll,

2549
01:17:32,361 --> 01:17:32,931
we'll have to see.

2550
01:17:32,931 --> 01:17:33,141
I mean,

2551
01:17:33,141 --> 01:17:33,974
I think I,

2552
01:17:34,390 --> 01:17:34,880
uh,

2553
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:35,181
it,

2554
01:17:35,181 --> 01:17:35,931
at least in my own mind,

2555
01:17:35,931 --> 01:17:40,070
I certainly made sense there and she
shouldn't have a lot of response to what I

2556
01:17:40,071 --> 01:17:40,880
was saying,

2557
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:41,211
but I,

2558
01:17:41,211 --> 01:17:43,040
I haven't heard the audio
or seeing the video.

2559
01:17:43,510 --> 01:17:43,910
Uh,

2560
01:17:43,910 --> 01:17:45,830
but the,

2561
01:17:46,460 --> 01:17:47,293
um,

2562
01:17:48,230 --> 01:17:49,063
so anyway,

2563
01:17:49,100 --> 01:17:54,100
I was at a dinner with a bunch of tech
ceos talking about this problem and one

2564
01:17:55,821 --> 01:17:57,500
guy who I won't name,

2565
01:17:57,501 --> 01:17:58,960
who runs a big company,

2566
01:17:59,260 --> 01:18:00,093
which I won't name,

2567
01:18:00,530 --> 01:18:01,430
I said,

2568
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:01,641
listen,

2569
01:18:01,641 --> 01:18:04,340
you have no idea how deep this goes.

2570
01:18:04,340 --> 01:18:06,840
Like I have an hr complaint where,

2571
01:18:07,480 --> 01:18:08,313
uh,

2572
01:18:08,500 --> 01:18:12,020
there's a guy who identifies as a furry,

2573
01:18:12,300 --> 01:18:17,000
he thinks he's a cat and because we don't
provide litter boxes in the bathroom,

2574
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:18,020
right?

2575
01:18:18,020 --> 01:18:18,853
He's,

2576
01:18:19,070 --> 01:18:20,480
he's launched an HR complaint,

2577
01:18:20,750 --> 01:18:21,170
right.

2578
01:18:21,170 --> 01:18:21,980
This is real,

2579
01:18:21,980 --> 01:18:22,460
this is real.

2580
01:18:22,460 --> 01:18:24,670
This was told as a real story in,

2581
01:18:24,671 --> 01:18:24,900
in,

2582
01:18:24,900 --> 01:18:25,550
in,

2583
01:18:25,550 --> 01:18:27,000
as a counterpoint or in,

2584
01:18:27,010 --> 01:18:29,670
in amplification of the story
we were talking about it.

2585
01:18:29,671 --> 01:18:30,081
Netflix,

2586
01:18:30,081 --> 01:18:30,680
right?

2587
01:18:30,680 --> 01:18:32,690
So it's like this is,

2588
01:18:35,290 --> 01:18:39,230
this is happening like this is
people are having to navigate ceos of

2589
01:18:39,260 --> 01:18:44,260
multimillion dollar companies are having
to navigate around this stuff in house.

2590
01:18:44,300 --> 01:18:44,571
Right.

2591
01:18:44,571 --> 01:18:45,620
And I mean,

2592
01:18:45,621 --> 01:18:47,630
the Google thing over James Demore,

2593
01:18:47,631 --> 01:18:47,871
right?

2594
01:18:47,871 --> 01:18:48,704
I mean that was,

2595
01:18:48,920 --> 01:18:51,230
that was an enormous problem for Google,

2596
01:18:51,380 --> 01:18:51,621
right?

2597
01:18:51,621 --> 01:18:56,090
Like that was the wheels were coming
off as far as I can tell from what I've

2598
01:18:56,091 --> 01:18:58,460
heard what and how.

2599
01:18:58,461 --> 01:18:59,570
So just that,

2600
01:18:59,660 --> 01:19:00,890
like there was a,

2601
01:19:00,891 --> 01:19:04,990
there was going to be a google
mutiny over James Damore if he was,

2602
01:19:05,100 --> 01:19:06,200
he has be fired.

2603
01:19:06,200 --> 01:19:06,381
Yeah.

2604
01:19:06,381 --> 01:19:06,950
Yeah.

2605
01:19:06,950 --> 01:19:07,370
This was,

2606
01:19:07,370 --> 01:19:08,810
this was a big deal at Google.

2607
01:19:09,620 --> 01:19:13,190
That's what he and what he
wrote was essentially like a,

2608
01:19:13,191 --> 01:19:13,540
you know,

2609
01:19:13,540 --> 01:19:15,890
a b plus term paper and human biology.

2610
01:19:15,891 --> 01:19:16,041
Right.

2611
01:19:16,041 --> 01:19:17,510
And it was like in May you can,

2612
01:19:17,990 --> 01:19:18,823
you can,

2613
01:19:20,630 --> 01:19:22,670
you can push back on some of the science,

2614
01:19:22,730 --> 01:19:23,271
say or.

2615
01:19:23,271 --> 01:19:27,290
But like this was not a malicious
distortion of the state of the science.

2616
01:19:27,390 --> 01:19:27,600
And,

2617
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:31,100
and this was not calling for
discrimination against women.

2618
01:19:31,101 --> 01:19:31,701
This was just saying,

2619
01:19:31,701 --> 01:19:32,480
listen,

2620
01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:34,640
men and women are different and
they've got different interests.

2621
01:19:34,641 --> 01:19:34,881
Right?

2622
01:19:34,881 --> 01:19:38,240
And this could account for why there's
an unequal representation at the left

2623
01:19:38,270 --> 01:19:40,550
level of software and
software development.

2624
01:19:41,240 --> 01:19:41,840
Uh,

2625
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:44,040
and so we're like,

2626
01:19:44,060 --> 01:19:45,770
we're on the left.

2627
01:19:46,130 --> 01:19:51,130
We're finding it very difficult to even
talk about differences between men and

2628
01:19:51,621 --> 01:19:52,190
women.

2629
01:19:52,190 --> 01:19:52,431
Right.

2630
01:19:52,431 --> 01:19:52,881
That there's,

2631
01:19:52,881 --> 01:19:53,610
you know,

2632
01:19:53,610 --> 01:19:54,300
start with,

2633
01:19:54,300 --> 01:19:56,480
start with a uterus and
then count from there.

2634
01:19:56,480 --> 01:19:57,170
Right.

2635
01:19:57,170 --> 01:20:00,350
That is already a taboo
conversation to have and that,

2636
01:20:00,370 --> 01:20:00,591
you know,

2637
01:20:00,591 --> 01:20:03,950
as we said at the beginning
in talking about twitter,

2638
01:20:04,610 --> 01:20:06,920
that one writer again,

2639
01:20:06,921 --> 01:20:07,110
I,

2640
01:20:07,110 --> 01:20:07,980
her name is Megan Murphy,

2641
01:20:09,780 --> 01:20:12,150
she got booted for
saying men are not women.

2642
01:20:12,590 --> 01:20:13,040
Yeah.

2643
01:20:13,040 --> 01:20:13,873
But that's.

2644
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:14,550
So,

2645
01:20:14,550 --> 01:20:15,000
so again,

2646
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:15,840
this was politically,

2647
01:20:15,841 --> 01:20:20,841
I'm very worried that unless we
resolve that or just cut through it,

2648
01:20:22,010 --> 01:20:22,843
uh,

2649
01:20:23,130 --> 01:20:26,130
we don't stand a chance
against trump in 2020.

2650
01:20:26,160 --> 01:20:30,330
I was reading a story about a woman
who was on some sort of an Lbgt,

2651
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:30,720
uh,

2652
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:32,280
panel and uh,

2653
01:20:32,520 --> 01:20:37,520
she's a part of some group and she was
kicked out of it by a man who identifies

2654
01:20:38,371 --> 01:20:41,010
as a lesbian and he has a penis.

2655
01:20:41,580 --> 01:20:42,413
Right?

2656
01:20:43,320 --> 01:20:44,110
Right.

2657
01:20:44,110 --> 01:20:44,943
Yeah,

2658
01:20:47,680 --> 01:20:48,250
exactly.

2659
01:20:48,250 --> 01:20:49,980
What ironically,

2660
01:20:50,320 --> 01:20:52,470
so this is the point that he has a penis.

2661
01:20:52,640 --> 01:20:56,640
I want to be sure he definitely identifies
as a lesbian that I might've read a

2662
01:20:56,641 --> 01:20:59,490
twitter comment about how preposterous
that was inside the penis part.

2663
01:21:00,070 --> 01:21:04,140
This is something that Andrew Sullivan
wrote in a recent article on this is that

2664
01:21:04,500 --> 01:21:09,500
the transgender thing is at odds with gay
rights in a fundamental sense and that

2665
01:21:11,071 --> 01:21:16,071
you can't balance these equations
because like two gay identity absolutely

2666
01:21:17,341 --> 01:21:20,880
focuses on the legitimate
differences between men and women.

2667
01:21:20,910 --> 01:21:22,140
It's like I'm a man,

2668
01:21:22,590 --> 01:21:23,520
I like men,

2669
01:21:23,580 --> 01:21:24,420
I like women.

2670
01:21:24,421 --> 01:21:25,440
That's my situation.

2671
01:21:25,890 --> 01:21:26,790
But once you,

2672
01:21:27,300 --> 01:21:28,900
once you change the,

2673
01:21:28,920 --> 01:21:29,300
your,

2674
01:21:29,300 --> 01:21:30,270
your notion of what,

2675
01:21:30,300 --> 01:21:30,780
you know,

2676
01:21:30,780 --> 01:21:32,850
how gender relates to sex,

2677
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:33,790
it,

2678
01:21:33,790 --> 01:21:37,500
it begins to erode this
claim on the legitimacy of,

2679
01:21:37,590 --> 01:21:37,920
of,

2680
01:21:37,920 --> 01:21:38,753
uh,

2681
01:21:38,940 --> 01:21:43,590
of a gay identity is that they're all
marginalized so they stick together.

2682
01:21:43,620 --> 01:21:44,341
That's the idea,

2683
01:21:44,341 --> 01:21:45,360
I guess behind it.

2684
01:21:45,930 --> 01:21:47,700
But there's something I
can only imagine what,

2685
01:21:47,770 --> 01:21:48,240
you know,

2686
01:21:48,240 --> 01:21:50,670
Andrew Sullivan's twitter feed
looks like now because he,

2687
01:21:50,690 --> 01:21:51,810
when he writes these articles,

2688
01:21:51,811 --> 01:21:55,640
I'm sure he's just gets eviscerated
by the left and he's just,

2689
01:21:55,641 --> 01:21:55,831
you know,

2690
01:21:55,831 --> 01:21:57,000
straight up talking about,

2691
01:21:57,600 --> 01:21:58,110
you know,

2692
01:21:58,110 --> 01:22:00,800
this is what gay rights
looks like and this is,

2693
01:22:00,950 --> 01:22:02,550
this is how you can't be a,

2694
01:22:03,030 --> 01:22:06,090
a man with a penis who's
identifies as a lesbian.

2695
01:22:06,150 --> 01:22:06,983
Right.

2696
01:22:06,990 --> 01:22:07,380
You know?

2697
01:22:07,380 --> 01:22:08,190
Yeah.

2698
01:22:08,190 --> 01:22:09,240
But you can't say that.

2699
01:22:09,690 --> 01:22:09,880
Oh,

2700
01:22:09,880 --> 01:22:14,880
and you also can't say that a man with
a penis is not a woman because if a man

2701
01:22:15,121 --> 01:22:15,841
with a penis,

2702
01:22:15,841 --> 01:22:18,180
I can say it because I can't be fired,

2703
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:20,670
but if you do say it,

2704
01:22:20,730 --> 01:22:22,200
you will get a certain amount of hate.

2705
01:22:22,260 --> 01:22:22,471
I mean,

2706
01:22:22,471 --> 01:22:26,760
there's people that are saying that men
who will not date trans women who still

2707
01:22:26,761 --> 01:22:27,600
have penises,

2708
01:22:27,900 --> 01:22:28,733
they're transphobic,

2709
01:22:28,740 --> 01:22:29,300
transphobia.

2710
01:22:29,300 --> 01:22:30,133
And this is,

2711
01:22:30,430 --> 01:22:30,820
I mean,

2712
01:22:30,820 --> 01:22:31,470
there's.

2713
01:22:31,470 --> 01:22:32,071
Have you ever,

2714
01:22:32,071 --> 01:22:32,370
uh,

2715
01:22:32,370 --> 01:22:33,510
have you ever met Jamie Kilstein?

2716
01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:36,630
So Jamie and I have a checkered history.

2717
01:22:36,631 --> 01:22:39,360
I don't know if maybe you
and I have spoken about this.

2718
01:22:39,361 --> 01:22:40,380
I've never met Jamie,

2719
01:22:40,381 --> 01:22:41,011
but Jamie,

2720
01:22:41,011 --> 01:22:43,140
when Jamie was social justice warrior,

2721
01:22:43,170 --> 01:22:43,770
number one,

2722
01:22:43,770 --> 01:22:44,401
he went hard.

2723
01:22:44,401 --> 01:22:45,910
He went hard on me.

2724
01:22:46,710 --> 01:22:47,230
Like he,

2725
01:22:47,230 --> 01:22:47,740
he just,

2726
01:22:47,740 --> 01:22:52,740
he was dunking on me endlessly
in ways that were totally unfair.

2727
01:22:52,921 --> 01:22:53,071
I mean,

2728
01:22:53,071 --> 01:22:53,850
he was just,

2729
01:22:53,850 --> 01:22:54,683
he was,

2730
01:22:55,510 --> 01:22:58,290
he was working very
hard to become an enemy.

2731
01:22:58,830 --> 01:23:00,270
And um,

2732
01:23:01,110 --> 01:23:02,280
then he had his,

2733
01:23:02,610 --> 01:23:06,220
his epiphany of then the
social justice mob came for him

2734
01:23:06,250 --> 01:23:11,250
over something for almost nothing
over him trying to get laid.

2735
01:23:11,560 --> 01:23:12,040
I mean,

2736
01:23:12,040 --> 01:23:14,110
like they were saying he was a
creep or something like that,

2737
01:23:14,150 --> 01:23:15,520
just try hitting on girls.

2738
01:23:16,540 --> 01:23:17,440
I miss the details there,

2739
01:23:17,441 --> 01:23:18,490
but then he came then.

2740
01:23:18,491 --> 01:23:21,090
So then he since sent me very,

2741
01:23:22,210 --> 01:23:23,043
uh,

2742
01:23:23,260 --> 01:23:26,090
friendly and apologetic
emails about Josie.

2743
01:23:26,091 --> 01:23:26,591
I'm sorry,

2744
01:23:26,591 --> 01:23:27,131
what I did.

2745
01:23:27,131 --> 01:23:27,370
And,

2746
01:23:27,370 --> 01:23:27,881
and you know,

2747
01:23:27,881 --> 01:23:28,090
he,

2748
01:23:28,090 --> 01:23:28,450
he wants,

2749
01:23:28,450 --> 01:23:29,500
he wants to do a podcast.

2750
01:23:29,501 --> 01:23:30,730
I haven't taken them up on it,

2751
01:23:30,731 --> 01:23:31,060
but,

2752
01:23:31,060 --> 01:23:31,893
um,

2753
01:23:32,110 --> 01:23:32,351
you know,

2754
01:23:32,351 --> 01:23:32,501
that,

2755
01:23:32,501 --> 01:23:34,570
that maybe that could be an
interesting conversation.

2756
01:23:34,571 --> 01:23:35,920
Sincerely apologetic.

2757
01:23:36,190 --> 01:23:37,060
He's a good guy.

2758
01:23:37,120 --> 01:23:37,481
I mean,

2759
01:23:37,481 --> 01:23:37,780
he,

2760
01:23:37,780 --> 01:23:37,970
he,

2761
01:23:37,970 --> 01:23:42,970
he and I had our own issue at one point
in time over a podcast that we did

2762
01:23:43,990 --> 01:23:44,880
versus,

2763
01:23:44,930 --> 01:23:45,320
uh,

2764
01:23:45,320 --> 01:23:46,153
it was,

2765
01:23:46,180 --> 01:23:50,170
you remember when the Daniel
Tosh rape controversy like,

2766
01:23:50,171 --> 01:23:50,810
uh,

2767
01:23:50,810 --> 01:23:51,031
do you,

2768
01:23:51,031 --> 01:23:51,671
do you remember this?

2769
01:23:51,671 --> 01:23:52,750
I know who talked about,

2770
01:23:52,860 --> 01:23:53,710
I missed the joke,

2771
01:23:53,711 --> 01:23:54,610
I should say rape joke.

2772
01:23:55,420 --> 01:23:57,820
Some woman in a crowd.

2773
01:23:57,821 --> 01:23:58,450
He was,

2774
01:23:58,450 --> 01:24:01,750
he was on stage and he
wasn't supposed to be there.

2775
01:24:01,780 --> 01:24:02,950
It was at the laugh factory.

2776
01:24:03,160 --> 01:24:03,611
And Dom,

2777
01:24:03,611 --> 01:24:05,950
I rera put them on stage and he goes,

2778
01:24:05,951 --> 01:24:06,161
look,

2779
01:24:06,161 --> 01:24:06,971
I don't have any material.

2780
01:24:06,971 --> 01:24:08,140
What do you guys want to talk about?

2781
01:24:08,560 --> 01:24:10,150
And some guy yells out,

2782
01:24:10,151 --> 01:24:10,984
rape.

2783
01:24:11,530 --> 01:24:12,363
And uh,

2784
01:24:12,490 --> 01:24:13,323
that's always helpful.

2785
01:24:13,360 --> 01:24:14,230
And so,

2786
01:24:14,270 --> 01:24:14,670
you know,

2787
01:24:14,670 --> 01:24:16,150
it's like some drunk and a crowd.

2788
01:24:16,320 --> 01:24:16,660
He goes,

2789
01:24:16,660 --> 01:24:17,510
she's crazy late.

2790
01:24:17,730 --> 01:24:20,160
And so Daniel tosh his take on it.

2791
01:24:20,920 --> 01:24:21,280
Okay.

2792
01:24:21,280 --> 01:24:21,760
What,

2793
01:24:21,760 --> 01:24:23,710
what's funny about that humiliation,

2794
01:24:23,711 --> 01:24:24,544
violence,

2795
01:24:24,660 --> 01:24:24,870
you know,

2796
01:24:24,870 --> 01:24:25,110
he's,

2797
01:24:25,110 --> 01:24:27,040
he's like berating,

2798
01:24:27,041 --> 01:24:29,560
this guy is trying to do
standup while he's doing this.

2799
01:24:29,830 --> 01:24:30,820
And some woman yells out,

2800
01:24:30,821 --> 01:24:33,130
actually there's nothing funny about rape.

2801
01:24:34,090 --> 01:24:34,541
And he goes,

2802
01:24:34,541 --> 01:24:38,680
wouldn't it be funny if someone who just
raped her and everybody starts laughing

2803
01:24:38,681 --> 01:24:42,070
or do you remember this woman wrote a
giant blog about it and she wanted him to

2804
01:24:42,071 --> 01:24:42,910
apologize about it.

2805
01:24:42,910 --> 01:24:46,210
And Jamie went after
Daniel Tosh as a fellow,

2806
01:24:46,670 --> 01:24:48,520
as a fellow comic saying that it's,

2807
01:24:48,970 --> 01:24:49,630
you know.

2808
01:24:49,630 --> 01:24:50,081
And I was like,

2809
01:24:50,081 --> 01:24:50,231
well,

2810
01:24:50,231 --> 01:24:51,100
she's a heckler.

2811
01:24:51,101 --> 01:24:52,360
The women women heckled,

2812
01:24:52,361 --> 01:24:55,910
like while he was trying to
do to stand up and he's like,

2813
01:24:55,950 --> 01:24:57,520
I'm not going to support rape culture.

2814
01:24:57,521 --> 01:24:57,881
And he's like,

2815
01:24:57,881 --> 01:24:59,320
how the fuck is that rape culture?

2816
01:24:59,321 --> 01:24:59,980
Like he's,

2817
01:24:59,980 --> 01:25:04,510
he's clearly making a joke about
something she said that was very,

2818
01:25:04,690 --> 01:25:05,860
very patronizing.

2819
01:25:06,130 --> 01:25:08,500
Like obviously he doesn't think
there's something funny about rape.

2820
01:25:08,501 --> 01:25:09,100
This is,

2821
01:25:09,100 --> 01:25:14,100
he's just trying to work through this
ad Lib set that he's doing with some guy

2822
01:25:14,651 --> 01:25:17,410
who yelled out something that this
whole crowd has to respond to.

2823
01:25:17,560 --> 01:25:20,530
He can't just ignore the
fact that it happened and go,

2824
01:25:20,710 --> 01:25:21,690
how about firetrucks,

2825
01:25:21,700 --> 01:25:22,150
folks?

2826
01:25:22,150 --> 01:25:22,421
Why?

2827
01:25:22,421 --> 01:25:24,400
They always read now he can't do that.

2828
01:25:24,401 --> 01:25:24,820
He's gotTa.

2829
01:25:24,820 --> 01:25:28,270
He's got deal with what this guy sat and
so that's what he tosses out there and

2830
01:25:28,271 --> 01:25:29,470
everybody laughed by the way,

2831
01:25:29,530 --> 01:25:32,170
but also isn't the priority
of his persona persona.

2832
01:25:32,230 --> 01:25:33,250
Just a villain.

2833
01:25:33,260 --> 01:25:34,570
He takes it to the edge,

2834
01:25:34,590 --> 01:25:34,860
right?

2835
01:25:34,860 --> 01:25:35,480
Yeah,

2836
01:25:35,480 --> 01:25:36,130
yeah.

2837
01:25:36,130 --> 01:25:36,550
He's,

2838
01:25:36,550 --> 01:25:36,790
yeah,

2839
01:25:36,790 --> 01:25:37,840
he's edgy comedian.

2840
01:25:37,841 --> 01:25:39,610
He's funny and you know,

2841
01:25:39,960 --> 01:25:42,790
Jamie and I had this little
tit for tat about it,

2842
01:25:42,791 --> 01:25:43,600
but he,

2843
01:25:43,600 --> 01:25:46,180
he's very honest about his mistakes.

2844
01:25:46,630 --> 01:25:48,040
Like when you talked to him and he's,

2845
01:25:48,060 --> 01:25:51,130
he's got great insight
because he was that guy,

2846
01:25:51,370 --> 01:25:51,551
you know,

2847
01:25:51,551 --> 01:25:55,150
he was that guy that was going back and
forth with people online all day and

2848
01:25:55,151 --> 01:25:55,980
checking is mentioned,

2849
01:25:55,980 --> 01:25:58,900
like couldn't walk down the street more
than five steps before he'd pull out his

2850
01:25:58,901 --> 01:26:03,490
phone and check has mentioned how people
responding to as late as Duncan take

2851
01:26:03,491 --> 01:26:04,390
down or you know,

2852
01:26:04,820 --> 01:26:05,390
it's just,

2853
01:26:05,390 --> 01:26:07,750
it's a toxic thing that people are doing.

2854
01:26:07,751 --> 01:26:08,320
It's this,

2855
01:26:08,320 --> 01:26:08,900
this,

2856
01:26:08,900 --> 01:26:09,230
you know,

2857
01:26:09,230 --> 01:26:10,850
looking for people that are,

2858
01:26:11,060 --> 01:26:13,610
that are bad and looking
for things that are wrong,

2859
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:15,200
looking for wrong speak.

2860
01:26:15,500 --> 01:26:16,490
It's very toxic.

2861
01:26:16,491 --> 01:26:18,110
It's toxic for the
people that are doing it.

2862
01:26:18,110 --> 01:26:19,850
It's toxic for the people
that are receiving it.

2863
01:26:20,140 --> 01:26:20,890
It's just,

2864
01:26:20,890 --> 01:26:24,110
it's not a way that human beings
would ever communicate in one on one.

2865
01:26:24,170 --> 01:26:24,500
I mean,

2866
01:26:24,500 --> 01:26:29,500
I tried to communicate with people
the same way online as I would have.

2867
01:26:30,441 --> 01:26:31,161
They're right in front of me.

2868
01:26:31,161 --> 01:26:32,120
I don't always succeed,

2869
01:26:32,240 --> 01:26:33,073
but I try.

2870
01:26:33,080 --> 01:26:33,913
That's my goal.

2871
01:26:34,010 --> 01:26:36,140
My goal is to try to talk to someone
as if they were right in front of me.

2872
01:26:36,350 --> 01:26:38,610
That's clearly not how
everybody's handling.

2873
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:42,290
I think road rage is the is the best
analogy for what's happening on social

2874
01:26:42,291 --> 01:26:42,690
media.

2875
01:26:42,690 --> 01:26:43,550
I've adopted that,

2876
01:26:43,580 --> 01:26:45,260
have adopted that way
of looking at it too,

2877
01:26:45,770 --> 01:26:47,840
and the only difference is a road rage.

2878
01:26:47,870 --> 01:26:48,081
You know,

2879
01:26:48,081 --> 01:26:51,650
there's like a physiological reason
for road rage because you're,

2880
01:26:51,710 --> 01:26:52,160
you're,

2881
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:55,430
you're in a dangerous situation that
you're subliminally taking stock going

2882
01:26:55,431 --> 01:26:56,264
fast.

2883
01:26:56,600 --> 01:26:59,750
You're going to a metal machine with
a bunch of assholes that are probably

2884
01:26:59,751 --> 01:27:03,080
looking at their phone and everybody's
going fast and you could die at any

2885
01:27:03,081 --> 01:27:04,100
moment if someone goes wrong.

2886
01:27:04,280 --> 01:27:05,810
If you're on a highway like the four,

2887
01:27:05,811 --> 01:27:06,261
oh five,

2888
01:27:06,261 --> 01:27:08,450
when you have five lanes
going 70 miles an hour,

2889
01:27:08,660 --> 01:27:11,150
it is a fucking miracle that no one dies.

2890
01:27:11,510 --> 01:27:13,070
And everyday we do it every day.

2891
01:27:13,071 --> 01:27:13,904
Everything's fine.

2892
01:27:14,950 --> 01:27:15,530
Yeah.

2893
01:27:15,530 --> 01:27:15,651
Well,

2894
01:27:15,651 --> 01:27:20,270
so let's go back to this idea of what the,

2895
01:27:20,510 --> 01:27:25,510
the actual normative response would be
when somebody puts their foot in their

2896
01:27:25,611 --> 01:27:28,820
mouth or something from
their past gets disclosed.

2897
01:27:28,821 --> 01:27:29,120
I mean the,

2898
01:27:29,120 --> 01:27:29,251
the,

2899
01:27:29,251 --> 01:27:29,620
the,

2900
01:27:29,620 --> 01:27:33,410
the stupid and indefensible
thing they did as a teenager,

2901
01:27:33,500 --> 01:27:33,890
right?

2902
01:27:33,890 --> 01:27:34,510
Yeah.

2903
01:27:34,510 --> 01:27:35,730
You know this,

2904
01:27:35,890 --> 01:27:36,723
you know,

2905
01:27:37,010 --> 01:27:42,010
you've got these guys who are now having
their careers destroyed for having

2906
01:27:42,591 --> 01:27:46,020
dressed up in black face or neck in a,

2907
01:27:46,060 --> 01:27:47,840
in a hood for Halloween
or whatever it was.

2908
01:27:47,841 --> 01:27:48,031
I mean,

2909
01:27:48,031 --> 01:27:48,151
I,

2910
01:27:48,151 --> 01:27:48,630
you know,

2911
01:27:48,630 --> 01:27:49,300
I think,

2912
01:27:49,300 --> 01:27:50,133
I think this,

2913
01:27:51,020 --> 01:27:54,180
that one politician said
he's not even in the,

2914
01:27:54,181 --> 01:27:54,801
in the photo,

2915
01:27:54,801 --> 01:27:57,590
but the photo was on his yearbook page
or like whatever you put on your yearbook

2916
01:27:57,591 --> 01:27:58,371
page in high school,

2917
01:27:58,371 --> 01:27:59,204
right?

2918
01:28:00,500 --> 01:28:02,030
You find out this thing that,

2919
01:28:02,031 --> 01:28:03,080
you know,

2920
01:28:03,081 --> 01:28:04,730
adult is going to defend,

2921
01:28:04,880 --> 01:28:05,510
right?

2922
01:28:05,510 --> 01:28:07,730
But what is the path back?

2923
01:28:07,760 --> 01:28:07,910
What?

2924
01:28:07,910 --> 01:28:08,181
Like what?

2925
01:28:08,181 --> 01:28:09,790
Like what is the reboot that,

2926
01:28:09,791 --> 01:28:13,370
what that should be acceptable
because we don't even know.

2927
01:28:13,730 --> 01:28:14,241
It seems.

2928
01:28:14,241 --> 01:28:15,350
We don't even know what

2929
01:28:17,420 --> 01:28:21,620
could conceivably work to
rehabilitate somebody career.

2930
01:28:22,160 --> 01:28:23,510
And yet on this other side,

2931
01:28:23,511 --> 01:28:28,340
we've got people who again are
being let out of prison for murders.

2932
01:28:28,341 --> 01:28:30,080
They admit they committed,

2933
01:28:30,140 --> 01:28:30,471
right?

2934
01:28:30,471 --> 01:28:31,101
Or rapes,

2935
01:28:31,101 --> 01:28:31,550
they admit,

2936
01:28:31,550 --> 01:28:34,760
admit they committed and
they're rehabilitated.

2937
01:28:34,761 --> 01:28:35,110
And we did.

2938
01:28:35,110 --> 01:28:35,630
And these are,

2939
01:28:35,630 --> 01:28:37,430
these are stories we're
supposed to feel good about,

2940
01:28:37,460 --> 01:28:37,641
right?

2941
01:28:37,641 --> 01:28:40,070
So we have to figure
out how to square this.

2942
01:28:40,750 --> 01:28:43,690
I'm on the left and you know,

2943
01:28:43,700 --> 01:28:44,533
I don't know,

2944
01:28:45,440 --> 01:28:50,440
I mean the way I've been thinking about
it is that it has to be intelligible,

2945
01:28:50,691 --> 01:28:54,290
how you are different from the
person who committed that thing.

2946
01:28:54,380 --> 01:28:54,740
Right.

2947
01:28:54,740 --> 01:28:55,573
So like if you,

2948
01:28:55,610 --> 01:29:00,610
if you did something that was let's say
legit racist when you were 20 and it was

2949
01:29:01,550 --> 01:29:02,160
like mark,

2950
01:29:02,160 --> 01:29:03,600
Mark Walberg is an example of this.

2951
01:29:03,600 --> 01:29:07,110
I mean he was running around
just beating people senseless.

2952
01:29:07,170 --> 01:29:07,530
Right.

2953
01:29:07,530 --> 01:29:10,440
And for avowed racist motives.

2954
01:29:10,441 --> 01:29:13,650
I believe when he was a teenager
he would guy lost his eye,

2955
01:29:13,800 --> 01:29:14,130
right?

2956
01:29:14,130 --> 01:29:14,810
Yeah.

2957
01:29:14,810 --> 01:29:15,060
Yeah.

2958
01:29:15,060 --> 01:29:15,420
So,

2959
01:29:15,420 --> 01:29:15,750
but,

2960
01:29:15,750 --> 01:29:16,740
and I think that was a,

2961
01:29:16,820 --> 01:29:18,120
I think I was a Vietnamese guy.

2962
01:29:18,121 --> 01:29:19,770
He attacked or uh,

2963
01:29:20,130 --> 01:29:24,510
but I mean he was just doing
truly indefensible things.

2964
01:29:24,511 --> 01:29:29,511
Now I don't know what sort of know pr
moment he has had since or how he's

2965
01:29:29,821 --> 01:29:30,870
apologized for it or.

2966
01:29:30,871 --> 01:29:31,980
But I mean that was a,

2967
01:29:32,120 --> 01:29:33,150
as a very different time.

2968
01:29:33,151 --> 01:29:33,984
I think if it was,

2969
01:29:34,050 --> 01:29:38,550
if all that stuff was being discovered
about him now there may be no way back

2970
01:29:38,580 --> 01:29:38,710
to.

2971
01:29:38,710 --> 01:29:43,080
Well my problem is with this day
and age it could be reignited.

2972
01:29:43,540 --> 01:29:47,070
Like even though he's apologized for
it and even though that it's been

2973
01:29:47,100 --> 01:29:47,933
addressed,

2974
01:29:48,030 --> 01:29:51,720
it absolutely get reignited image just
made talking about on your podcast is

2975
01:29:51,780 --> 01:29:52,613
fucking him over.

2976
01:29:52,680 --> 01:29:53,070
Could.

2977
01:29:53,070 --> 01:29:53,371
Yeah.

2978
01:29:53,371 --> 01:29:58,140
I mean and also people have to recognize
that there's some things that you can't

2979
01:29:58,141 --> 01:30:03,141
retroactively instill today's ideas
of what constitutes racism on 1985.

2980
01:30:05,580 --> 01:30:10,480
So if you were in high school in 1985
and you dressed up as Mr t that you know,

2981
01:30:10,530 --> 01:30:12,390
I don't know if that was racist back then.

2982
01:30:12,480 --> 01:30:13,291
I never did it,

2983
01:30:13,291 --> 01:30:14,700
but I don't know if that's racist.

2984
01:30:14,701 --> 01:30:17,960
Like if you had a bunch of gold chains
and you made your hair black and are you

2985
01:30:17,970 --> 01:30:20,040
making you made your face black
and gave herself a Mohawk.

2986
01:30:20,041 --> 01:30:20,251
He said,

2987
01:30:20,251 --> 01:30:23,670
I'm Mr t for Halloween and
the pictures emerged today.

2988
01:30:24,090 --> 01:30:28,830
What you did when you went door to door
when you were 15 or 12 or whatever,

2989
01:30:28,831 --> 01:30:31,320
you were knocking on people's
doors and everybody was laughing.

2990
01:30:31,350 --> 01:30:34,200
Oh you're Mr. t nobody
thought it was racist,

2991
01:30:34,710 --> 01:30:36,150
but let's take.

2992
01:30:36,280 --> 01:30:37,230
Let's take the hard case.

2993
01:30:37,230 --> 01:30:39,420
Let's say you were racist,

2994
01:30:39,421 --> 01:30:39,631
right?

2995
01:30:39,631 --> 01:30:39,781
I mean,

2996
01:30:39,781 --> 01:30:41,920
so like I had this guy
is a Christian pitcher,

2997
01:30:41,921 --> 01:30:46,110
Eleni on my podcast once who's
an ex neonazis just legit racist,

2998
01:30:46,111 --> 01:30:46,231
right?

2999
01:30:46,231 --> 01:30:47,880
It's got all the tattoos to prove it.

3000
01:30:48,410 --> 01:30:51,200
And now their major problems with
Christian pitcher Delaney as,

3001
01:30:51,220 --> 01:30:51,600
as,

3002
01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:52,021
as I think,

3003
01:30:52,021 --> 01:30:52,720
you know,

3004
01:30:52,720 --> 01:30:53,000
uh,

3005
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:54,960
that I discovered after that podcast.

3006
01:30:54,961 --> 01:30:55,630
But,

3007
01:30:55,630 --> 01:30:56,463
um,

3008
01:30:56,490 --> 01:30:58,290
so this is not an endorsement of him,

3009
01:30:58,650 --> 01:30:59,011
sorry,

3010
01:30:59,011 --> 01:30:59,820
Christian.

3011
01:30:59,820 --> 01:31:00,653
But the,

3012
01:31:01,210 --> 01:31:02,043
the,

3013
01:31:02,050 --> 01:31:02,880
the,

3014
01:31:02,880 --> 01:31:04,020
there's a path back.

3015
01:31:04,021 --> 01:31:04,181
I mean,

3016
01:31:04,181 --> 01:31:06,300
it's like he's celebrated on the left,

3017
01:31:06,380 --> 01:31:08,220
like he's a former Neo Nazi and he is,

3018
01:31:08,221 --> 01:31:08,730
you know,

3019
01:31:08,730 --> 01:31:08,940
hey,

3020
01:31:08,940 --> 01:31:09,460
I,

3021
01:31:09,460 --> 01:31:14,460
I discovered him on Sarah Silvermans
a show on wherever that is,

3022
01:31:14,491 --> 01:31:15,324
Hulu.

3023
01:31:15,450 --> 01:31:16,200
Um,

3024
01:31:16,200 --> 01:31:18,090
and uh,

3025
01:31:18,390 --> 01:31:18,571
you know,

3026
01:31:18,571 --> 01:31:19,800
he's a darling of the left,

3027
01:31:19,801 --> 01:31:23,730
right at Darlene of Msnbc
for this redemption story.

3028
01:31:23,880 --> 01:31:24,211
So,

3029
01:31:24,211 --> 01:31:25,800
but what is the,

3030
01:31:25,801 --> 01:31:30,801
you take someone like any of these
politicians who have something in their

3031
01:31:30,991 --> 01:31:33,120
backstory that is ugly.

3032
01:31:33,830 --> 01:31:34,590
Uh,

3033
01:31:34,590 --> 01:31:39,590
my feeling is all there has to be is a
transparent and intelligible account of

3034
01:31:41,731 --> 01:31:46,200
how you are now different of how you
can actually honestly look back on this

3035
01:31:46,201 --> 01:31:47,310
thing and say,

3036
01:31:47,940 --> 01:31:48,450
yeah,

3037
01:31:48,450 --> 01:31:51,390
I am as embarrassed by that
as you think I should be.

3038
01:31:51,391 --> 01:31:51,670
Right.

3039
01:31:51,670 --> 01:31:52,200
That's not like,

3040
01:31:52,200 --> 01:31:53,400
that is nothing that,

3041
01:31:53,600 --> 01:31:56,640
that does not represent how
I view the world at all now.

3042
01:31:58,050 --> 01:32:03,050
But there's just the spirit
of the time on social media,

3043
01:32:03,370 --> 01:32:03,731
again,

3044
01:32:03,731 --> 01:32:08,731
especially on the left and to our total
dysfunction politically is to never

3045
01:32:10,121 --> 01:32:11,740
accept any of that.

3046
01:32:11,890 --> 01:32:12,221
I mean there's,

3047
01:32:12,221 --> 01:32:16,310
there is no apology good enough and um,

3048
01:32:17,440 --> 01:32:17,771
or that,

3049
01:32:17,771 --> 01:32:18,290
or there's,

3050
01:32:18,290 --> 01:32:18,760
you know,

3051
01:32:18,760 --> 01:32:22,060
the most cynical possible
interpretation of your,

3052
01:32:22,120 --> 01:32:23,260
of your apology.

3053
01:32:23,430 --> 01:32:24,850
It's like you're just trying to,

3054
01:32:24,890 --> 01:32:27,820
you're the only reason
why you're apologizing is
because you want to save your

3055
01:32:27,821 --> 01:32:28,330
job.

3056
01:32:28,330 --> 01:32:29,163
Yes.

3057
01:32:29,770 --> 01:32:30,330
And that,

3058
01:32:30,330 --> 01:32:30,880
you know,

3059
01:32:30,880 --> 01:32:32,470
we have to figure out how to.

3060
01:32:32,770 --> 01:32:32,981
I mean,

3061
01:32:32,981 --> 01:32:37,981
we just need some recovery disk that we
can reboot from here because it's just

3062
01:32:38,651 --> 01:32:39,820
not a,

3063
01:32:40,680 --> 01:32:42,280
this is going someplace terrible.

3064
01:32:42,370 --> 01:32:43,300
And again,

3065
01:32:43,380 --> 01:32:46,410
to look at it through the
Lens narrowly politically of,

3066
01:32:46,500 --> 01:32:46,700
uh,

3067
01:32:46,700 --> 01:32:47,530
you know,

3068
01:32:47,530 --> 01:32:48,640
over the next two years,

3069
01:32:49,130 --> 01:32:49,670
it's,

3070
01:32:49,670 --> 01:32:51,820
it's to the massive
disadvantage of the left.

3071
01:32:52,150 --> 01:32:52,841
It certainly is,

3072
01:32:52,841 --> 01:32:55,330
but I don't see any way to fix that.

3073
01:32:55,390 --> 01:32:59,140
Like with the current climate and
this current attitude where people are

3074
01:32:59,141 --> 01:33:00,970
engaging in this recreational outrage,

3075
01:33:01,150 --> 01:33:02,320
it fits the climate.

3076
01:33:02,830 --> 01:33:03,401
I don't mean,

3077
01:33:03,401 --> 01:33:07,060
I don't know what would have to happen
for people to come to some sort of a

3078
01:33:07,061 --> 01:33:07,894
realization.

3079
01:33:07,900 --> 01:33:10,620
I mean it would have to happen
to them like it did to James.

3080
01:33:11,140 --> 01:33:12,500
Like what happened with Jamie sees,

3081
01:33:12,700 --> 01:33:14,170
they turned on him and he's like,

3082
01:33:14,171 --> 01:33:14,651
oh my God,

3083
01:33:14,651 --> 01:33:15,484
this is awful.

3084
01:33:15,640 --> 01:33:16,320
Like I'm,

3085
01:33:16,320 --> 01:33:17,153
what's this?

3086
01:33:17,530 --> 01:33:18,610
And then he realized,

3087
01:33:18,640 --> 01:33:18,851
you know,

3088
01:33:18,851 --> 01:33:19,420
I mean,

3089
01:33:19,420 --> 01:33:22,630
I don't know what other
thing could happen,

3090
01:33:22,760 --> 01:33:24,130
know what we're,

3091
01:33:24,160 --> 01:33:26,620
the game we're playing is part of it.

3092
01:33:26,620 --> 01:33:26,771
I mean,

3093
01:33:26,771 --> 01:33:28,930
you and I are in a position
to take risks that,

3094
01:33:29,220 --> 01:33:29,500
you know,

3095
01:33:29,500 --> 01:33:32,680
even the people at the top of journalism,

3096
01:33:32,790 --> 01:33:33,700
you can't.

3097
01:33:33,701 --> 01:33:33,871
I mean,

3098
01:33:33,871 --> 01:33:34,040
like,

3099
01:33:34,040 --> 01:33:36,250
like Megan Kelly says one
wrong thing and you know,

3100
01:33:36,251 --> 01:33:38,820
it doesn't matter that she's
got a $20,000,000 contract.

3101
01:33:38,840 --> 01:33:39,341
She's just,

3102
01:33:39,341 --> 01:33:40,174
she's fired.

3103
01:33:40,470 --> 01:33:41,303
Uh,

3104
01:33:41,770 --> 01:33:43,570
and when you look at
the thing that she said,

3105
01:33:44,020 --> 01:33:44,321
I mean,

3106
01:33:44,321 --> 01:33:45,510
it was just a question.

3107
01:33:45,550 --> 01:33:46,030
Yeah.

3108
01:33:46,030 --> 01:33:50,710
I mean she just didn't seem to understand
how charged the phrase black face was.

3109
01:33:50,770 --> 01:33:51,011
Right?

3110
01:33:51,011 --> 01:33:53,590
She's just ignorant of that
piece of history or something.

3111
01:33:53,591 --> 01:33:53,981
But like,

3112
01:33:53,981 --> 01:33:54,191
you know,

3113
01:33:54,191 --> 01:33:54,760
so she just,

3114
01:33:54,760 --> 01:33:55,240
she should,

3115
01:33:55,240 --> 01:33:56,260
she put her foot in her mouth.

3116
01:33:56,830 --> 01:33:58,810
She gave an apology that was just like,

3117
01:33:58,870 --> 01:33:59,380
you know,

3118
01:33:59,380 --> 01:34:01,530
full blown hostage video apology,

3119
01:34:01,560 --> 01:34:02,190
just like,

3120
01:34:02,190 --> 01:34:02,540
you know,

3121
01:34:02,540 --> 01:34:04,750
just like I'm so fucking sorry.

3122
01:34:04,751 --> 01:34:05,391
You don't even know,

3123
01:34:05,391 --> 01:34:05,530
like,

3124
01:34:05,530 --> 01:34:08,250
here take a sample of my blood
and you'll just see my task,

3125
01:34:08,290 --> 01:34:10,720
my cortisol and not good enough.

3126
01:34:11,050 --> 01:34:11,830
Not good enough.

3127
01:34:11,830 --> 01:34:16,240
And they let her say the
apology is even more crazy.

3128
01:34:16,241 --> 01:34:16,481
They,

3129
01:34:16,481 --> 01:34:17,470
they let her come back,

3130
01:34:17,471 --> 01:34:18,670
say the apology and then you have good.

3131
01:34:18,671 --> 01:34:19,231
Thanks for doing that.

3132
01:34:19,231 --> 01:34:20,064
Yeah.

3133
01:34:21,400 --> 01:34:21,671
So,

3134
01:34:21,671 --> 01:34:22,590
but so she,

3135
01:34:22,810 --> 01:34:27,490
no one's job in that space is secure
enough where they can take real risks.

3136
01:34:27,610 --> 01:34:28,190
But you know,

3137
01:34:28,190 --> 01:34:29,200
you and I,

3138
01:34:29,860 --> 01:34:30,191
you know,

3139
01:34:30,191 --> 01:34:32,590
you and I could do an
interview with Louis C,

3140
01:34:32,591 --> 01:34:33,430
k right,

3141
01:34:33,520 --> 01:34:33,821
like,

3142
01:34:33,821 --> 01:34:38,821
and just process his coming back into
stand up and do it in a way where people

3143
01:34:40,151 --> 01:34:40,750
didn't like it.

3144
01:34:40,750 --> 01:34:41,201
You just say,

3145
01:34:41,201 --> 01:34:41,441
okay,

3146
01:34:41,441 --> 01:34:42,041
fuck off.

3147
01:34:42,041 --> 01:34:42,281
Right.

3148
01:34:42,281 --> 01:34:47,281
This is the conversation we had and
I think modeling that more and more.

3149
01:34:47,471 --> 01:34:47,571
I mean,

3150
01:34:47,571 --> 01:34:48,250
I think,

3151
01:34:48,250 --> 01:34:51,970
I think we have to take those risks and
people like us have to take those risks

3152
01:34:52,570 --> 01:34:57,570
and hope to break the spell
by having those in public.

3153
01:34:58,700 --> 01:35:01,880
I would hope that we're having
some kind of an impact on it.

3154
01:35:01,881 --> 01:35:02,900
But I feel like we're,

3155
01:35:03,710 --> 01:35:04,071
you know,

3156
01:35:04,071 --> 01:35:08,450
we're throwing buckets of
cold water into a volcano.

3157
01:35:08,540 --> 01:35:08,920
I just,

3158
01:35:08,920 --> 01:35:10,160
I just don't know.

3159
01:35:10,220 --> 01:35:11,720
I don't know if it's enough.

3160
01:35:11,750 --> 01:35:12,160
I just,

3161
01:35:12,160 --> 01:35:13,490
we have pretty big buckets.

3162
01:35:13,491 --> 01:35:13,671
I mean,

3163
01:35:13,671 --> 01:35:14,810
you have an enormous bucket.

3164
01:35:14,870 --> 01:35:15,081
I mean,

3165
01:35:15,081 --> 01:35:15,231
you're,

3166
01:35:15,231 --> 01:35:19,850
you're reaching more people than the
biggest television shows are reaching.

3167
01:35:19,851 --> 01:35:21,140
People aren't aware of this,

3168
01:35:21,230 --> 01:35:22,520
but it's just a fact.

3169
01:35:22,521 --> 01:35:23,000
So it's,

3170
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:23,400
it's,

3171
01:35:23,400 --> 01:35:24,233
uh,

3172
01:35:24,950 --> 01:35:26,390
so I think that's part of it.

3173
01:35:26,600 --> 01:35:31,600
And then changing the norm somehow of
how we engage on social media I think is

3174
01:35:33,430 --> 01:35:34,490
is another piece.

3175
01:35:34,610 --> 01:35:34,970
Yeah,

3176
01:35:34,970 --> 01:35:35,600
I agree.

3177
01:35:35,600 --> 01:35:36,433
I agree with you.

3178
01:35:36,680 --> 01:35:40,940
The norm on how we engage on social
media I think is flavored by two things.

3179
01:35:40,941 --> 01:35:41,420
One,

3180
01:35:41,420 --> 01:35:42,770
the immediacy of it,

3181
01:35:42,950 --> 01:35:45,200
the fact that there's no
person in front of you,

3182
01:35:45,201 --> 01:35:46,960
you don't experience their,

3183
01:35:46,961 --> 01:35:51,110
their anger or their fear or their
sadness when you say something fucked up.

3184
01:35:51,650 --> 01:35:56,650
But also anonymity and I think
anonymity is good in a lot of ways.

3185
01:35:57,111 --> 01:35:58,230
Like for whistleblowers,

3186
01:35:58,610 --> 01:36:02,810
people that work in a certain
environment where they want to be honest,

3187
01:36:02,811 --> 01:36:04,190
but they would get fired,

3188
01:36:04,630 --> 01:36:04,930
you know,

3189
01:36:04,930 --> 01:36:06,830
with a very restricted environment.

3190
01:36:06,831 --> 01:36:08,930
But they have maybe a
controversial opinion.

3191
01:36:08,931 --> 01:36:09,764
They want to,

3192
01:36:09,860 --> 01:36:12,860
they want to be able to express
free speech and they can't.

3193
01:36:12,920 --> 01:36:14,810
They can't unless they
do something anonymous.

3194
01:36:14,811 --> 01:36:17,000
And even sometimes people
when they do things anonymous,

3195
01:36:17,001 --> 01:36:19,130
they get caught and they get in trouble.

3196
01:36:19,131 --> 01:36:21,920
Like I remember there was
a guy on four Chan who was,

3197
01:36:22,280 --> 01:36:25,190
who would say a bunch of fucked
up things like a lot of people do,

3198
01:36:25,640 --> 01:36:30,440
and people tracked him down and found
out who he was and then sent all of these

3199
01:36:30,560 --> 01:36:35,560
anonymously authored posts to his employer
and he got fired and this guy was a

3200
01:36:36,050 --> 01:36:40,580
father and he had children and he was
supporting his family and now he's

3201
01:36:40,581 --> 01:36:41,780
struggling to make a living.

3202
01:36:41,780 --> 01:36:45,560
He's got to try to figure because he
wrote some things anonymously online on a

3203
01:36:45,561 --> 01:36:49,670
message board and he found recreation
and saying fucked up things,

3204
01:36:50,050 --> 01:36:50,270
you know,

3205
01:36:50,270 --> 01:36:51,530
I don't know.

3206
01:36:51,531 --> 01:36:53,210
I don't know what the solution is,

3207
01:36:53,510 --> 01:36:55,820
but I feel like anonymity,

3208
01:36:56,890 --> 01:37:01,330
it encourages less hospitable behavior.

3209
01:37:01,600 --> 01:37:04,750
Did you hear about the professor
at a academic conference?

3210
01:37:05,020 --> 01:37:07,330
Get into an elevator and making A.

3211
01:37:07,870 --> 01:37:09,520
Just a dad joke of it so he gets it,

3212
01:37:09,521 --> 01:37:14,260
gets into a crowded elevator in an
academic conference and someone asked what

3213
01:37:14,261 --> 01:37:15,400
floor and he says,

3214
01:37:15,401 --> 01:37:16,630
women's lingerie please.

3215
01:37:17,830 --> 01:37:19,000
Dean Martin joke or whatever.

3216
01:37:19,001 --> 01:37:19,834
Right.

3217
01:37:19,870 --> 01:37:23,020
Someone in the elevator
was so offended by that,

3218
01:37:23,500 --> 01:37:26,250
that they lodge a complaint and I,

3219
01:37:26,460 --> 01:37:26,680
I've,

3220
01:37:26,680 --> 01:37:27,300
I've,

3221
01:37:27,300 --> 01:37:30,550
it's been now at least a month
or so since I heard the story,

3222
01:37:30,700 --> 01:37:31,810
so I don't know if he was fired,

3223
01:37:31,811 --> 01:37:36,760
but like he was fighting for his academic
life over this complaint process.

3224
01:37:36,820 --> 01:37:37,790
Dean Martin show.

3225
01:37:39,300 --> 01:37:40,510
I mean just like that,

3226
01:37:40,540 --> 01:37:45,540
that in the fullness of time that is going
to seem like some insane which panic,

3227
01:37:48,460 --> 01:37:48,791
right?

3228
01:37:48,791 --> 01:37:52,480
Like there's no such thing as witches
and yet people are getting burned alive

3229
01:37:52,510 --> 01:37:54,760
because of the allegations
with witchcraft.

3230
01:37:55,470 --> 01:37:58,570
We're in that kind of situation and we,

3231
01:37:58,860 --> 01:38:01,080
we just have to wake up.

3232
01:38:01,100 --> 01:38:01,560
Yeah.

3233
01:38:01,560 --> 01:38:02,760
And and so,

3234
01:38:03,450 --> 01:38:05,850
well you and I don't
teach and we're not in a,

3235
01:38:05,880 --> 01:38:08,250
in a university and
we're not in that bubble.

3236
01:38:08,640 --> 01:38:12,180
I think the people that are in that bubble
than the escape that bubble and go to

3237
01:38:12,210 --> 01:38:14,310
whatever tech company
or whatever business,

3238
01:38:14,430 --> 01:38:18,990
they continue that same bubble like
behavior and they want everybody to

3239
01:38:18,991 --> 01:38:19,680
acquiesce.

3240
01:38:19,680 --> 01:38:23,850
They want everybody around them to behave
the way that they've been programmed

3241
01:38:23,851 --> 01:38:25,800
to think that everybody
is supposed to behave.

3242
01:38:26,160 --> 01:38:28,470
And you see that now from
a lot of young people,

3243
01:38:28,471 --> 01:38:31,810
you see a lot of young people who
are entering into the workforce.

3244
01:38:31,811 --> 01:38:36,811
I think that the standards and the norms
that they got enforced upon them at

3245
01:38:36,991 --> 01:38:38,450
Yale or Columbia,

3246
01:38:38,470 --> 01:38:39,760
wherever they went to school,

3247
01:38:39,761 --> 01:38:41,970
like this is how you're
supposed to behave,

3248
01:38:41,971 --> 01:38:46,680
but social justice is important and this
is real and you have to recognize your

3249
01:38:46,681 --> 01:38:47,281
privilege.

3250
01:38:47,281 --> 01:38:50,340
You have to check your privilege and you
have to do this and you have to do that

3251
01:38:50,341 --> 01:38:52,970
and you have to support trans rights
and you have to call out culture.

3252
01:38:53,270 --> 01:38:54,660
Call out culture is a big one.

3253
01:38:54,690 --> 01:38:55,770
That's a big part of it.

3254
01:38:55,771 --> 01:38:56,790
And canceled culture.

3255
01:38:57,220 --> 01:38:57,990
You know,

3256
01:38:57,990 --> 01:39:00,720
everybody wants everybody
to lose their job.

3257
01:39:00,780 --> 01:39:01,210
You want.

3258
01:39:01,210 --> 01:39:03,240
I mean this is the way that things change.

3259
01:39:03,390 --> 01:39:06,450
The way things change is you have to
reinforce the fact that there's these new

3260
01:39:06,451 --> 01:39:11,451
standards and it has to be severe
repercussions for deviating so very,

3261
01:39:11,810 --> 01:39:12,930
very much about controlling.

3262
01:39:12,931 --> 01:39:15,150
Jordan goes on about this Jordan Peterson.

3263
01:39:15,620 --> 01:39:17,010
That's like one of his pet subjects.

3264
01:39:17,470 --> 01:39:19,380
Then yeah,

3265
01:39:19,620 --> 01:39:20,790
this is where this goes.

3266
01:39:20,820 --> 01:39:25,500
This is all about control and that it's
a very slippery slope and when you start

3267
01:39:25,501 --> 01:39:29,280
telling people what to do and what
not to do and that there's these

3268
01:39:29,790 --> 01:39:30,630
indefensible,

3269
01:39:30,631 --> 01:39:35,550
undebatable standards that have to be
reinforced and you can't talk about it

3270
01:39:35,610 --> 01:39:35,970
like,

3271
01:39:35,970 --> 01:39:37,290
and that's what happened with Megan Kelly.

3272
01:39:37,530 --> 01:39:37,800
She said,

3273
01:39:37,800 --> 01:39:38,431
well how come?

3274
01:39:38,431 --> 01:39:38,761
And they're like,

3275
01:39:38,761 --> 01:39:40,230
get the fuck Outta here.

3276
01:39:41,520 --> 01:39:43,050
Sixty dollars million dollar job.

3277
01:39:43,840 --> 01:39:44,201
Again.

3278
01:39:44,201 --> 01:39:45,940
The crucial moment for me is

3279
01:39:47,560 --> 01:39:50,200
why is it that the
apology isn't good enough?

3280
01:39:50,280 --> 01:39:53,950
That this isn't what
is by all appearances,

3281
01:39:54,010 --> 01:39:55,450
a sincere apology.

3282
01:39:55,700 --> 01:39:55,980
Like,

3283
01:39:55,980 --> 01:39:56,801
like where the link,

3284
01:39:56,801 --> 01:39:59,800
there is no link to real racism.

3285
01:39:59,980 --> 01:40:01,000
Like there's no link to like,

3286
01:40:01,330 --> 01:40:01,781
oh yeah,

3287
01:40:01,781 --> 01:40:05,080
I want to live in a society where black
people have it harder than white people.

3288
01:40:05,110 --> 01:40:05,381
Right?

3289
01:40:05,381 --> 01:40:05,980
Like,

3290
01:40:05,980 --> 01:40:06,251
okay,

3291
01:40:06,251 --> 01:40:06,670
if that,

3292
01:40:06,670 --> 01:40:07,361
if that's who you are,

3293
01:40:07,361 --> 01:40:12,361
if you're racist will then find we know
we can understand why we want to boycott

3294
01:40:12,491 --> 01:40:13,570
your business or we want to,

3295
01:40:13,590 --> 01:40:14,300
you know,

3296
01:40:14,300 --> 01:40:16,060
you want nothing to do with you.

3297
01:40:16,240 --> 01:40:16,490
Right?

3298
01:40:16,490 --> 01:40:18,280
There should be massive.

3299
01:40:18,281 --> 01:40:22,870
So social pressure against those kinds
of noxious political commitments.

3300
01:40:23,290 --> 01:40:27,040
But if someone misspeaks or it's
an off color joke and they were,

3301
01:40:27,060 --> 01:40:29,740
it was like they weren't trying
to offend anyone and they're just,

3302
01:40:30,370 --> 01:40:30,880
you know,

3303
01:40:30,880 --> 01:40:32,620
they wish they could
take it back and like,

3304
01:40:32,621 --> 01:40:32,821
and,

3305
01:40:32,821 --> 01:40:33,230
and,

3306
01:40:33,230 --> 01:40:34,540
and that links up with,

3307
01:40:34,930 --> 01:40:35,141
I mean,

3308
01:40:35,141 --> 01:40:38,860
did you say you must've
seen the norm macdonald?

3309
01:40:39,030 --> 01:40:39,500
Yes.

3310
01:40:39,500 --> 01:40:40,750
I mean that was brutal,

3311
01:40:41,020 --> 01:40:41,350
right?

3312
01:40:41,350 --> 01:40:43,000
Like it's at what he was,

3313
01:40:43,360 --> 01:40:43,630
you know,

3314
01:40:43,630 --> 01:40:46,390
he knew he couldn't use the word retard.

3315
01:40:46,391 --> 01:40:46,691
Right.

3316
01:40:46,691 --> 01:40:48,730
Because it's like that that's
going to get them in trouble.

3317
01:40:49,090 --> 01:40:49,923
And so,

3318
01:40:50,460 --> 01:40:51,220
I mean,

3319
01:40:51,220 --> 01:40:52,240
it's hilarious.

3320
01:40:52,241 --> 01:40:53,074
And explain what.

3321
01:40:53,260 --> 01:40:53,441
Okay.

3322
01:40:53,441 --> 01:40:54,090
So he was,

3323
01:40:54,090 --> 01:40:55,210
he was on Howard stern show,

3324
01:40:55,211 --> 01:40:55,690
wasn't it?

3325
01:40:55,690 --> 01:40:56,290
I think,

3326
01:40:56,290 --> 01:40:57,123
I think he was,

3327
01:40:57,910 --> 01:40:58,810
I could have this wrong,

3328
01:40:58,811 --> 01:41:00,790
but the gist of this is his right,

3329
01:41:01,480 --> 01:41:06,480
I believe is on the Howard stern show
and he was about to use the word retard.

3330
01:41:07,430 --> 01:41:07,820
So,

3331
01:41:07,820 --> 01:41:08,290
so,

3332
01:41:08,290 --> 01:41:08,930
okay,

3333
01:41:08,930 --> 01:41:10,040
we'll walk this back now.

3334
01:41:10,110 --> 01:41:11,560
Now it's coming back to me.

3335
01:41:12,100 --> 01:41:14,690
He was defense.

3336
01:41:14,710 --> 01:41:17,900
He was talking about his friend that the,

3337
01:41:17,910 --> 01:41:18,060
the,

3338
01:41:18,060 --> 01:41:22,870
the ordeal that Louis Ck has gone through
in this just massive exile experience,

3339
01:41:22,871 --> 01:41:23,051
right?

3340
01:41:23,051 --> 01:41:23,290
He's,

3341
01:41:23,290 --> 01:41:26,230
there's massive social shunning a.

3342
01:41:26,500 --> 01:41:28,230
and he said he,

3343
01:41:28,320 --> 01:41:30,690
he was describing it in a way where it,

3344
01:41:31,090 --> 01:41:33,880
he then got accused that he was,

3345
01:41:33,970 --> 01:41:36,490
he cared more about what
Lucy Kay was going through,

3346
01:41:36,700 --> 01:41:39,790
then the women who felt very
victimized by Louis C K,

3347
01:41:40,360 --> 01:41:43,720
and that was not his
intention at all apparently.

3348
01:41:43,720 --> 01:41:44,590
And so when he went to,

3349
01:41:44,591 --> 01:41:44,860
uh,

3350
01:41:44,860 --> 01:41:46,060
to clarify this,

3351
01:41:46,570 --> 01:41:47,870
he was about to say,

3352
01:41:47,950 --> 01:41:48,170
you,

3353
01:41:48,170 --> 01:41:53,170
you'd have to be retarded to think that
I cared more about Louis Ck is ordeal

3354
01:41:53,740 --> 01:41:57,220
than the ordeal of these women who had
felt that their careers got derailed.

3355
01:41:57,221 --> 01:41:58,054
Right.

3356
01:41:58,060 --> 01:42:02,050
But as the word retard was coming or
retarded was coming out of his mouth,

3357
01:42:02,470 --> 01:42:05,860
he tried to course correct and because
he doesn't know what the fuck he's

3358
01:42:05,861 --> 01:42:06,401
talking about,

3359
01:42:06,401 --> 01:42:08,560
he says you'd have to have downs syndrome,

3360
01:42:09,270 --> 01:42:09,640
right?

3361
01:42:09,640 --> 01:42:10,421
Which is worse,

3362
01:42:10,421 --> 01:42:10,661
right?

3363
01:42:10,661 --> 01:42:12,340
Is more specific and it's what it's like.

3364
01:42:12,341 --> 01:42:14,000
And then you got all these
parents with Down's syndrome who,

3365
01:42:14,050 --> 01:42:14,590
uh,

3366
01:42:14,590 --> 01:42:15,910
who have kids with down
syndrome who are just,

3367
01:42:16,270 --> 01:42:17,103
Oh my God.

3368
01:42:17,620 --> 01:42:19,600
And so now he's just,

3369
01:42:19,670 --> 01:42:20,440
he's.

3370
01:42:20,440 --> 01:42:20,950
Then he was,

3371
01:42:20,950 --> 01:42:22,330
he showed up on the view,

3372
01:42:22,360 --> 01:42:23,290
right with this,

3373
01:42:23,590 --> 01:42:24,300
this,

3374
01:42:24,300 --> 01:42:25,133
uh,

3375
01:42:25,660 --> 01:42:27,250
on this apology tour.

3376
01:42:27,340 --> 01:42:28,240
And I mean,

3377
01:42:28,241 --> 01:42:31,990
that's just amazing video to see
him on the view surrounded by these,

3378
01:42:32,140 --> 01:42:35,260
these four women who
know he's not a bad guy,

3379
01:42:35,261 --> 01:42:35,500
right?

3380
01:42:35,500 --> 01:42:36,040
Like they're trying,

3381
01:42:36,040 --> 01:42:39,280
they're trying to just throwing them
a lifeline after lifeline and he's so

3382
01:42:39,281 --> 01:42:44,230
beaten down and he's so walking on
eggshells and you got Whoopi Goldberg,

3383
01:42:44,231 --> 01:42:44,381
you know,

3384
01:42:44,381 --> 01:42:46,630
trying to just pull him back,

3385
01:42:46,631 --> 01:42:46,841
you know,

3386
01:42:46,841 --> 01:42:48,670
from the lions.

3387
01:42:49,150 --> 01:42:49,983
And

3388
01:42:51,880 --> 01:42:52,713
it should be.

3389
01:42:52,900 --> 01:42:53,350
I mean,

3390
01:42:53,350 --> 01:42:56,960
it should be so straightforward
like it does it.

3391
01:42:57,160 --> 01:42:58,870
Is it part of norms,

3392
01:42:58,930 --> 01:43:03,930
goal to cause pain for parents who
have kids with mental disabilities,

3393
01:43:05,100 --> 01:43:05,540
right?

3394
01:43:05,540 --> 01:43:06,370
No,

3395
01:43:06,370 --> 01:43:06,900
I mean,

3396
01:43:06,900 --> 01:43:07,210
like,

3397
01:43:07,210 --> 01:43:08,070
like you,

3398
01:43:08,220 --> 01:43:09,390
you can look in,

3399
01:43:09,400 --> 01:43:14,400
you can look into this guy's eyes for t
for 10 seconds and know that this is not

3400
01:43:14,531 --> 01:43:15,640
the biggest you're worried about.

3401
01:43:16,300 --> 01:43:16,750
Of course,

3402
01:43:16,750 --> 01:43:17,530
you know.

3403
01:43:17,530 --> 01:43:19,000
And um,

3404
01:43:20,230 --> 01:43:22,560
and yet people just want
him destroyed overnight.

3405
01:43:22,600 --> 01:43:23,470
I don't know if they still do,

3406
01:43:23,471 --> 01:43:25,510
but it's like the moment where it was,

3407
01:43:26,800 --> 01:43:27,460
I think it was,

3408
01:43:27,460 --> 01:43:27,730
uh,

3409
01:43:27,730 --> 01:43:30,550
a real concern that has his
show would get canceled.

3410
01:43:30,550 --> 01:43:30,701
I me,

3411
01:43:30,701 --> 01:43:31,600
like this was a while.

3412
01:43:31,610 --> 01:43:35,950
It hasn't been for a second season and
maybe that's maybe that's part of the

3413
01:43:35,951 --> 01:43:36,720
problem.

3414
01:43:36,720 --> 01:43:37,553
It is part of the problem.

3415
01:43:37,570 --> 01:43:37,860
He was,

3416
01:43:37,860 --> 01:43:38,830
he was devastated.

3417
01:43:38,831 --> 01:43:39,664
I mean I'm,

3418
01:43:39,730 --> 01:43:41,370
I'm very good friends with Adam Egan.

3419
01:43:41,380 --> 01:43:42,690
He's a guy that runs the comedy store,

3420
01:43:42,691 --> 01:43:46,720
is the talent director at the comedy
store and he's been on norm show.

3421
01:43:46,721 --> 01:43:48,010
He was on norms.

3422
01:43:48,040 --> 01:43:49,570
He was like norm sidekick on the show.

3423
01:43:49,571 --> 01:43:54,230
He's a very good friend with nora and
norm really suffered from this in a way

3424
01:43:54,231 --> 01:43:57,260
that he never saw anything in his
career in terms of like his own personal

3425
01:43:57,261 --> 01:43:58,050
feeling.

3426
01:43:58,050 --> 01:43:59,270
Like he was devastated by it,

3427
01:43:59,271 --> 01:44:03,110
by the blow back and the reaction and
he wanted to come on my podcast and talk

3428
01:44:03,111 --> 01:44:03,471
about it.

3429
01:44:03,471 --> 01:44:04,370
But netflix is like,

3430
01:44:04,371 --> 01:44:07,880
get the fuck that's like said no press.

3431
01:44:07,881 --> 01:44:08,631
Don't do anything.

3432
01:44:08,631 --> 01:44:09,290
No press.

3433
01:44:09,290 --> 01:44:09,720
Okay.

3434
01:44:09,720 --> 01:44:13,190
So the fact that you can't
talk your way out of.

3435
01:44:13,200 --> 01:44:13,670
Yes,

3436
01:44:13,670 --> 01:44:15,050
that's the fucking disease.

3437
01:44:15,080 --> 01:44:15,231
Well,

3438
01:44:15,231 --> 01:44:17,360
the problem is not that you
can't talk your way out of it.

3439
01:44:17,361 --> 01:44:20,060
The problem was that they wouldn't even
let him attempt to talk your way out of

3440
01:44:20,061 --> 01:44:23,960
it because they think they realized that
norms a maniac and norm is a maniac in

3441
01:44:23,961 --> 01:44:27,530
the best sense of the word is one of
my favorite comics and he's fucking

3442
01:44:27,531 --> 01:44:28,070
hilarious,

3443
01:44:28,070 --> 01:44:30,960
but he's also completely crazy
in the best way possible.

3444
01:44:31,010 --> 01:44:31,360
Right.

3445
01:44:31,360 --> 01:44:31,641
Norman?

3446
01:44:31,641 --> 01:44:36,530
I randomly in some strange way randomly
were seated next to each other on two

3447
01:44:36,531 --> 01:44:37,364
separate flights.

3448
01:44:37,410 --> 01:44:37,700
Yeah,

3449
01:44:37,700 --> 01:44:38,690
just randomly skirt.

3450
01:44:38,780 --> 01:44:39,613
It's crazy.

3451
01:44:39,650 --> 01:44:40,610
Like nor have again,

3452
01:44:40,611 --> 01:44:44,960
like this is crazy and we had a great
time just talking to the entire flight and

3453
01:44:46,170 --> 01:44:48,350
we were talking about cigarettes longer,

3454
01:44:48,351 --> 01:44:48,471
like,

3455
01:44:48,471 --> 01:44:48,851
yeah,

3456
01:44:48,851 --> 01:44:49,181
yeah,

3457
01:44:49,181 --> 01:44:49,341
yeah.

3458
01:44:49,341 --> 01:44:50,091
I used to smoke.

3459
01:44:50,091 --> 01:44:50,990
I'm so glad I quit.

3460
01:44:51,320 --> 01:44:52,410
Fucking terrible for you.

3461
01:44:52,411 --> 01:44:53,000
You know?

3462
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:53,833
I mean it's just.

3463
01:44:53,990 --> 01:44:56,810
But I just always wanted a
cigarette and then it'd be gambling.

3464
01:44:56,811 --> 01:44:57,620
I want a cigarette,

3465
01:44:57,620 --> 01:44:58,251
but I quit.

3466
01:44:58,251 --> 01:44:58,550
Fuck,

3467
01:44:58,550 --> 01:44:59,181
fuck cigarettes.

3468
01:44:59,181 --> 01:44:59,991
Like how long did you quit?

3469
01:44:59,991 --> 01:45:00,530
And you're like,

3470
01:45:00,530 --> 01:45:00,890
oh,

3471
01:45:00,890 --> 01:45:02,330
I haven't had a cigarette in years.

3472
01:45:02,600 --> 01:45:02,811
I'm like,

3473
01:45:02,811 --> 01:45:02,931
oh,

3474
01:45:02,931 --> 01:45:03,650
that's great.

3475
01:45:03,650 --> 01:45:04,970
We landed lax.

3476
01:45:04,971 --> 01:45:06,740
He goes right into a
store and buy cigarettes.

3477
01:45:06,741 --> 01:45:06,951
I go,

3478
01:45:06,951 --> 01:45:07,731
what are you doing?

3479
01:45:07,731 --> 01:45:09,170
He goes all that talk of cigarettes.

3480
01:45:09,171 --> 01:45:10,004
I just want one now.

3481
01:45:10,160 --> 01:45:12,530
He was lighting it on
the way out the door.

3482
01:45:12,531 --> 01:45:13,760
He couldn't get out the door.

3483
01:45:13,850 --> 01:45:17,030
He lit it before he
the the automatic door.

3484
01:45:17,060 --> 01:45:18,710
He was before it was opening.

3485
01:45:18,711 --> 01:45:19,880
He was lighting that cigarette.

3486
01:45:20,130 --> 01:45:20,511
I was like,

3487
01:45:20,511 --> 01:45:21,344
you're crazy.

3488
01:45:21,350 --> 01:45:22,880
But that's many.

3489
01:45:22,881 --> 01:45:25,880
Many comedians are incredibly
impulsive and this is norm.

3490
01:45:25,881 --> 01:45:26,714
I mean he just.

3491
01:45:27,080 --> 01:45:27,770
He's got such a.

3492
01:45:27,770 --> 01:45:29,150
he's so off kilter.

3493
01:45:29,151 --> 01:45:32,780
He's got a sort of Garry shandling and
like you don't know what's going to come

3494
01:45:32,790 --> 01:45:34,240
out of his mouth extemporaneously.

3495
01:45:34,240 --> 01:45:34,850
Yes,

3496
01:45:34,850 --> 01:45:35,930
but okay.

3497
01:45:35,980 --> 01:45:37,610
We have to be.

3498
01:45:38,750 --> 01:45:41,570
Let's put this back into
the diversity Olympics.

3499
01:45:41,571 --> 01:45:44,960
We need some respect for neuro diversity.

3500
01:45:45,210 --> 01:45:45,441
Right?

3501
01:45:45,441 --> 01:45:49,370
There are people who are somewhere
on the spectrum toward autism,

3502
01:45:49,371 --> 01:45:49,581
right?

3503
01:45:49,581 --> 01:45:52,400
There's people who are that there's
spectrums we don't even know about.

3504
01:45:52,590 --> 01:45:57,590
We haven't named for sure and everyone
is in some weird spot and people

3505
01:45:58,860 --> 01:45:59,630
misspeak.

3506
01:45:59,630 --> 01:46:00,110
Right?

3507
01:46:00,110 --> 01:46:02,300
There has to be a way back to say,

3508
01:46:02,630 --> 01:46:03,620
that's not what I meant.

3509
01:46:03,830 --> 01:46:04,101
Right.

3510
01:46:04,101 --> 01:46:04,281
Like,

3511
01:46:04,281 --> 01:46:09,281
like this is like offending people
of this type was not my intention.

3512
01:46:11,900 --> 01:46:13,820
At some level that has to be good enough.

3513
01:46:13,821 --> 01:46:14,301
Unless,

3514
01:46:14,301 --> 01:46:14,690
you know,

3515
01:46:14,690 --> 01:46:18,290
we open your closet and we see that
you've got swastikas everywhere,

3516
01:46:18,291 --> 01:46:19,124
you know,

3517
01:46:19,220 --> 01:46:20,650
and um,

3518
01:46:21,740 --> 01:46:23,540
so I think we have to,

3519
01:46:24,100 --> 01:46:26,090
we have to hold the line here,

3520
01:46:26,120 --> 01:46:26,400
you know,

3521
01:46:26,400 --> 01:46:30,230
and very few people are in a
position to be able to do it.

3522
01:46:30,231 --> 01:46:30,930
I mean he's like,

3523
01:46:30,930 --> 01:46:31,763
you know,

3524
01:46:31,790 --> 01:46:32,450
Netflix,

3525
01:46:32,450 --> 01:46:34,310
Netflix doesn't feel they can do it.

3526
01:46:34,790 --> 01:46:35,031
Well,

3527
01:46:35,031 --> 01:46:40,031
Netflix is just so terrified of continual
blowback and they just thought like,

3528
01:46:40,041 --> 01:46:41,210
if we're going to save this show,

3529
01:46:41,211 --> 01:46:44,240
the way to save it is to get them to
stop talking because he's just going to

3530
01:46:44,241 --> 01:46:46,730
just take his other foot and take
other people's feet and stuff.

3531
01:46:46,731 --> 01:46:47,660
Them and his mouth as well.

3532
01:46:47,960 --> 01:46:50,040
I think one thing that help

3533
01:46:50,070 --> 01:46:55,070
to illuminate our understanding of how
people behave is what you really enjoy

3534
01:46:55,081 --> 01:47:00,081
talking about and you really definitely
changed my way of looking at things that

3535
01:47:00,270 --> 01:47:00,781
they're really.

3536
01:47:00,781 --> 01:47:05,310
Essentially the concept of free will is
a very flawed thing and that you have to

3537
01:47:05,311 --> 01:47:08,940
really take into consideration who a
person is right now and what what has

3538
01:47:08,941 --> 01:47:13,350
caused them to be this person right now
and that a lot of us are operating on

3539
01:47:13,351 --> 01:47:18,351
this really bizarre momentum of of our
past and our behavior and our genetics

3540
01:47:18,541 --> 01:47:21,780
and life experiences and all these
different variables that really need to be

3541
01:47:21,781 --> 01:47:22,620
taken into account.

3542
01:47:22,621 --> 01:47:26,970
This idea that you are autonomous and
you are the director of your own life is

3543
01:47:26,971 --> 01:47:28,200
true to a certain extent,

3544
01:47:28,590 --> 01:47:30,930
but it's also very complicated,

3545
01:47:30,960 --> 01:47:34,890
much more complicated than we would like
to admit and when you're talking about

3546
01:47:34,891 --> 01:47:37,110
something that happened when you were 17,

3547
01:47:37,440 --> 01:47:39,060
like Brett kavanaugh
or something like that,

3548
01:47:39,550 --> 01:47:40,830
but Jesus Christ,

3549
01:47:40,831 --> 01:47:42,120
you know you're going to hold a 55,

3550
01:47:42,570 --> 01:47:45,660
55 year old man accountable to
something that he did when he was 17.

3551
01:47:45,661 --> 01:47:49,110
It wasn't a crime and you're
not exactly sure what happened.

3552
01:47:49,170 --> 01:47:49,451
That's.

3553
01:47:49,451 --> 01:47:50,880
This is all very strange.

3554
01:47:50,881 --> 01:47:52,020
This is a very strange stuff.

3555
01:47:52,190 --> 01:47:52,520
Well,

3556
01:47:52,520 --> 01:47:57,520
so taking the red pill on on freewill
makes you much more forgiving of a lot of

3557
01:48:02,151 --> 01:48:06,380
this stuff because you see just
everyone is an open system.

3558
01:48:07,850 --> 01:48:09,680
No one offered themselves,

3559
01:48:09,810 --> 01:48:11,660
no one created the themselves,

3560
01:48:11,661 --> 01:48:12,494
no one,

3561
01:48:12,950 --> 01:48:17,950
no one can directly regulate the effect
of every influence that they had or

3562
01:48:19,011 --> 01:48:19,641
didn't have.

3563
01:48:19,641 --> 01:48:19,791
You know,

3564
01:48:19,791 --> 01:48:20,071
it's like you,

3565
01:48:20,071 --> 01:48:24,860
you are the totality of
what brought you here.

3566
01:48:24,861 --> 01:48:25,041
I mean,

3567
01:48:25,041 --> 01:48:29,600
the universe has sort of just pushed
you to this point in time and the only

3568
01:48:29,601 --> 01:48:34,601
thing you've got is your brain
and it states and that is,

3569
01:48:34,910 --> 01:48:38,960
that is based on your genes and the
totality of environmental influences.

3570
01:48:38,961 --> 01:48:39,340
You,

3571
01:48:39,340 --> 01:48:39,650
you're,

3572
01:48:39,650 --> 01:48:41,150
you had a system have,

3573
01:48:41,210 --> 01:48:45,500
have had working on you
up until this moment.

3574
01:48:45,590 --> 01:48:50,000
And so the next words that come out of
your mouth are part of that process.

3575
01:48:50,540 --> 01:48:52,250
Now the peep.

3576
01:48:52,280 --> 01:48:53,840
Some people find this to be,

3577
01:48:53,880 --> 01:48:54,713
uh,

3578
01:48:55,010 --> 01:48:55,250
you know,

3579
01:48:55,250 --> 01:48:56,083
frankly

3580
01:48:57,380 --> 01:48:59,260
demoralizing picture or they think,

3581
01:48:59,270 --> 01:48:59,391
well,

3582
01:48:59,391 --> 01:48:59,601
okay,

3583
01:48:59,601 --> 01:48:59,841
well I'm,

3584
01:48:59,841 --> 01:49:00,410
you're telling me,

3585
01:49:00,410 --> 01:49:01,460
telling me I'm just a robot,

3586
01:49:01,520 --> 01:49:04,700
but you're a robot that is open,

3587
01:49:04,701 --> 01:49:07,010
continuously open to influence,

3588
01:49:07,070 --> 01:49:10,880
to influence of either internally
based on its own processes.

3589
01:49:10,880 --> 01:49:11,031
I mean,

3590
01:49:11,031 --> 01:49:15,590
there's like there's top down control of
the executive function in the brain to

3591
01:49:16,010 --> 01:49:16,341
your,

3592
01:49:16,341 --> 01:49:16,581
you know,

3593
01:49:16,581 --> 01:49:17,570
your emotional life,

3594
01:49:18,020 --> 01:49:18,620
say,

3595
01:49:18,620 --> 01:49:23,300
and you're continually open
to the influences of culture,

3596
01:49:23,420 --> 01:49:23,691
right?

3597
01:49:23,691 --> 01:49:23,830
You know,

3598
01:49:23,830 --> 01:49:27,740
the cultures as operating system that
you're interacting with in each moment and

3599
01:49:28,610 --> 01:49:32,410
whatever's getting in can change
you in radical ways very quickly.

3600
01:49:32,411 --> 01:49:37,190
And there's no telling how much you
can change on the basis of one new idea

3601
01:49:37,280 --> 01:49:39,470
coming your way right now.

3602
01:49:39,471 --> 01:49:41,630
I would argue that that process of change,

3603
01:49:41,631 --> 01:49:41,781
I mean,

3604
01:49:41,781 --> 01:49:46,781
if I say something that changes your
view on anything that's not evidence of

3605
01:49:47,590 --> 01:49:49,960
that is evidence of
just yet more causality.

3606
01:49:49,961 --> 01:49:50,171
I mean,

3607
01:49:50,171 --> 01:49:50,620
you don't,

3608
01:49:50,620 --> 01:49:52,330
you don't pick the changes
that come your way.

3609
01:49:52,331 --> 01:49:52,571
If I,

3610
01:49:52,571 --> 01:49:55,810
if I get you to see something that
you didn't see a moment before,

3611
01:49:56,500 --> 01:49:59,560
you're not responsible for the fact that
you didn't see it a moment before and

3612
01:49:59,561 --> 01:50:02,140
you're not responsible for the fact
that you now see it is just like the

3613
01:50:02,141 --> 01:50:03,580
dominoes just kept falling,

3614
01:50:03,710 --> 01:50:04,543
right?

3615
01:50:04,690 --> 01:50:05,523
Um,

3616
01:50:05,800 --> 01:50:10,800
but it does give you this
far more patient sense of,

3617
01:50:12,600 --> 01:50:13,433
um,

3618
01:50:14,830 --> 01:50:15,371
one,

3619
01:50:15,371 --> 01:50:15,720
just,

3620
01:50:15,720 --> 01:50:16,120
just,

3621
01:50:16,120 --> 01:50:16,953
you know,

3622
01:50:17,530 --> 01:50:20,580
all the causes and conditions
that have created the,

3623
01:50:20,590 --> 01:50:21,340
this,

3624
01:50:21,340 --> 01:50:22,540
this ods behavior.

3625
01:50:22,541 --> 01:50:22,721
You're,

3626
01:50:22,721 --> 01:50:23,010
you're,

3627
01:50:23,010 --> 01:50:25,600
you're now disposed to
react to in the world,

3628
01:50:25,601 --> 01:50:25,751
right?

3629
01:50:25,751 --> 01:50:25,960
Like,

3630
01:50:25,960 --> 01:50:28,800
like you can everything on some level is,

3631
01:50:28,801 --> 01:50:32,200
is more of a force of nature than it
is something that you need to take

3632
01:50:32,201 --> 01:50:32,711
personally.

3633
01:50:32,711 --> 01:50:34,690
It's like if there's a
hurricane blowing outside,

3634
01:50:35,260 --> 01:50:39,070
we don't respond to it the
same way we would respond to,

3635
01:50:39,690 --> 01:50:40,210
you know,

3636
01:50:40,210 --> 01:50:42,400
al Qaeda dropping a bomb on us,

3637
01:50:42,401 --> 01:50:42,581
right?

3638
01:50:42,581 --> 01:50:42,921
Because it might,

3639
01:50:42,921 --> 01:50:44,710
it might create the same amount of damage.

3640
01:50:45,040 --> 01:50:46,180
But the,

3641
01:50:46,350 --> 01:50:46,961
in the,

3642
01:50:46,961 --> 01:50:51,130
in the latter case where we have
an identifiable identifiable agent,

3643
01:50:51,460 --> 01:50:52,293
right?

3644
01:50:52,630 --> 01:50:53,530
We feel like,

3645
01:50:53,531 --> 01:50:53,741
okay,

3646
01:50:53,741 --> 01:50:56,920
now we're in the presence of human
evil and we have to go kill these

3647
01:50:56,921 --> 01:50:59,020
motherfuckers right now
we may have to kill them.

3648
01:50:59,110 --> 01:50:59,351
Right?

3649
01:50:59,351 --> 01:51:00,720
Because that may be the only way of,

3650
01:51:00,721 --> 01:51:01,000
of,

3651
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:01,990
of putting out this,

3652
01:51:02,140 --> 01:51:02,973
this,

3653
01:51:03,090 --> 01:51:03,923
you know,

3654
01:51:04,330 --> 01:51:06,430
stopping the damage there.

3655
01:51:06,530 --> 01:51:07,720
They're committed to causing.

3656
01:51:07,721 --> 01:51:08,530
But,

3657
01:51:08,530 --> 01:51:10,690
and we would kill hurricanes
if we could kill them.

3658
01:51:10,691 --> 01:51:10,931
Right?

3659
01:51:10,931 --> 01:51:11,111
I mean,

3660
01:51:11,111 --> 01:51:11,350
we would,

3661
01:51:11,350 --> 01:51:11,591
you know,

3662
01:51:11,591 --> 01:51:13,420
we would nullify them,

3663
01:51:13,421 --> 01:51:16,540
but the feeling we have in
both cases is very different.

3664
01:51:16,660 --> 01:51:21,660
The feeling you have attributing ultimate
authorship to a person's behavior is

3665
01:51:22,721 --> 01:51:27,721
super a narrow a
psychologically and ethically,

3666
01:51:28,271 --> 01:51:29,104
and it's,

3667
01:51:29,590 --> 01:51:30,130
you know,

3668
01:51:30,130 --> 01:51:31,360
the feeling of vengeance,

3669
01:51:31,570 --> 01:51:31,841
right?

3670
01:51:31,841 --> 01:51:32,021
Like,

3671
01:51:32,021 --> 01:51:32,441
like you don't,

3672
01:51:32,441 --> 01:51:32,901
you,

3673
01:51:32,901 --> 01:51:33,560
you don't,

3674
01:51:33,560 --> 01:51:38,530
you have this feeling of vengeance is so
natural to get triggered in response to

3675
01:51:38,531 --> 01:51:39,364
a person.

3676
01:51:39,850 --> 01:51:43,420
It's not natural in response to a wild
animal who may have done something

3677
01:51:43,421 --> 01:51:43,960
terrible.

3678
01:51:43,960 --> 01:51:44,171
Right?

3679
01:51:44,171 --> 01:51:45,720
I mean like you would like.

3680
01:51:45,730 --> 01:51:50,140
I mean there have been examples of this
where people have taken vengeance on

3681
01:51:50,141 --> 01:51:55,141
animals and it just looks like a kind
of moral dysfunction on the part of the

3682
01:51:55,721 --> 01:51:56,230
people that did it.

3683
01:51:56,230 --> 01:51:56,351
I mean,

3684
01:51:56,351 --> 01:51:57,520
there's a famous picture of a,

3685
01:51:58,240 --> 01:52:01,720
an elephant that got hung from a railroad
crane I think back in the twenties.

3686
01:52:01,721 --> 01:52:01,871
Right?

3687
01:52:01,871 --> 01:52:05,290
So like the circus elephant
escaped and it ran,

3688
01:52:05,310 --> 01:52:06,143
you know,

3689
01:52:06,340 --> 01:52:10,220
rampage through the streets and
trampled by a few people and the,

3690
01:52:10,370 --> 01:52:11,171
and the people in the,

3691
01:52:11,171 --> 01:52:11,801
in the town.

3692
01:52:11,801 --> 01:52:12,571
I don't know where this was,

3693
01:52:12,571 --> 01:52:17,530
it was a baltimore or someplace were so
outraged that they've decided to lynch

3694
01:52:17,531 --> 01:52:18,230
the elephant,

3695
01:52:18,230 --> 01:52:18,540
right?

3696
01:52:18,540 --> 01:52:19,210
Like,

3697
01:52:19,210 --> 01:52:21,160
and yet that's,

3698
01:52:21,180 --> 01:52:24,760
there's something uncanny about that
sort of misappropriation of agency to an

3699
01:52:24,761 --> 01:52:25,331
elephant and what,

3700
01:52:25,331 --> 01:52:25,900
what is,

3701
01:52:25,900 --> 01:52:29,800
what is a mistreated circus elephant
gonna do when he gets out and is terrified

3702
01:52:29,801 --> 01:52:30,850
and he's trying to get away from people,

3703
01:52:30,851 --> 01:52:31,960
it's going to trample a few people.

3704
01:52:32,770 --> 01:52:37,770
So we have a very different set of books
we keep ethically for humans and by

3705
01:52:40,780 --> 01:52:42,040
some of it's understandable,

3706
01:52:42,041 --> 01:52:43,150
some of it's inevitable,

3707
01:52:43,210 --> 01:52:47,450
but a lot of it gives us moral that
we don't need to have and it gives a,

3708
01:52:47,510 --> 01:52:48,590
it gives us a kind of

3709
01:52:50,180 --> 01:52:53,540
just an inability to take stock of all
the variables that are actually guiding

3710
01:52:53,541 --> 01:52:58,340
human behavior and react to them and
mitigate them and disincentivize them

3711
01:52:58,341 --> 01:52:59,174
intelligently.

3712
01:52:59,330 --> 01:53:00,081
Made punishment.

3713
01:53:00,081 --> 01:53:01,010
Makes Sense.

3714
01:53:01,640 --> 01:53:03,560
Not because people really,

3715
01:53:03,561 --> 01:53:07,010
really deserve at bottom
whatever their punishments are.

3716
01:53:07,460 --> 01:53:08,750
It doesn't make sense in a,

3717
01:53:08,751 --> 01:53:09,584
in a retro,

3718
01:53:09,590 --> 01:53:10,760
retributive paradigm.

3719
01:53:11,300 --> 01:53:13,410
It makes sense if it,

3720
01:53:13,580 --> 01:53:18,580
if it's the best tool to
discourage dangerous behavior,

3721
01:53:19,740 --> 01:53:20,573
uh,

3722
01:53:21,140 --> 01:53:22,310
and it works,

3723
01:53:22,340 --> 01:53:22,641
right?

3724
01:53:22,641 --> 01:53:23,091
So it's like,

3725
01:53:23,091 --> 01:53:23,430
you know,

3726
01:53:23,430 --> 01:53:24,251
if you're,

3727
01:53:24,251 --> 01:53:26,630
if you're going to punish people
for things they can't control,

3728
01:53:27,170 --> 01:53:28,003
well that's stupid,

3729
01:53:28,070 --> 01:53:28,371
right?

3730
01:53:28,371 --> 01:53:29,360
Because if you,

3731
01:53:29,480 --> 01:53:31,670
as much as you punish them
that you're not going to,

3732
01:53:31,700 --> 01:53:33,140
you're not going to moderate the behavior.

3733
01:53:33,770 --> 01:53:37,490
So you have to punish people for things
that are actually under voluntary

3734
01:53:37,491 --> 01:53:41,420
control and it only.

3735
01:53:41,421 --> 01:53:46,421
It only makes sense if it's
the only tool to do the job.

3736
01:53:47,091 --> 01:53:48,430
And if the moment you had.

3737
01:53:48,431 --> 01:53:51,890
I mean this may have brought this up
last time we spoke about free will,

3738
01:53:53,150 --> 01:53:55,550
but this is really the sort
of reductio ad absurdum of,

3739
01:53:55,551 --> 01:53:58,130
of where most people are on this topic.

3740
01:53:58,760 --> 01:54:02,420
The moment we really understand
human evil at the level of the brain,

3741
01:54:02,421 --> 01:54:04,310
the moment we understand psychopathy say,

3742
01:54:04,311 --> 01:54:04,610
which was,

3743
01:54:04,610 --> 01:54:06,410
let me maybe that's not
the totality of evil,

3744
01:54:06,411 --> 01:54:08,720
but that's certainly
center of the Bullseye.

3745
01:54:10,190 --> 01:54:13,610
Once we understand psychopathy is a
neurological condition that's governed by

3746
01:54:13,611 --> 01:54:16,190
genes and environment and we can,

3747
01:54:16,580 --> 01:54:20,240
we can actually intrude at the
level of the brain to mitigate it.

3748
01:54:20,241 --> 01:54:22,550
So like psychopathy becomes a disease,

3749
01:54:22,551 --> 01:54:22,701
right?

3750
01:54:22,701 --> 01:54:23,534
It becomes a,

3751
01:54:23,700 --> 01:54:23,890
a,

3752
01:54:23,890 --> 01:54:25,790
an injuries syndrome,

3753
01:54:25,820 --> 01:54:26,600
right?

3754
01:54:26,600 --> 01:54:27,530
That we can fix.

3755
01:54:28,040 --> 01:54:28,670
And let's say it's,

3756
01:54:28,670 --> 01:54:30,050
let's say it's a very simple fix.

3757
01:54:30,051 --> 01:54:30,920
Let's say it's a pill,

3758
01:54:30,980 --> 01:54:31,191
right?

3759
01:54:31,191 --> 01:54:35,480
Let's say it's just a neurotransmitter
imbalance in the presence of that

3760
01:54:35,750 --> 01:54:36,583
breakthrough,

3761
01:54:37,220 --> 01:54:41,480
we will feel very differently
about that species of human evil.

3762
01:54:41,600 --> 01:54:43,770
We will not judge it in the same way will,

3763
01:54:43,820 --> 01:54:47,540
because what will happen is you'll
give people the pill and they'll say,

3764
01:54:47,541 --> 01:54:47,991
fuck,

3765
01:54:47,991 --> 01:54:50,420
I can't believe I was
that dangerous asshole.

3766
01:54:50,480 --> 01:54:50,661
Like,

3767
01:54:50,661 --> 01:54:51,890
like the thank you for like,

3768
01:54:51,891 --> 01:54:52,461
like I,

3769
01:54:52,461 --> 01:54:57,461
I'm as horrified by who I was before
you cured me as you were right.

3770
01:54:58,100 --> 01:54:59,730
And it.

3771
01:55:00,040 --> 01:55:04,430
So it'll psychopathy and the presence of
a cure for it would look much more like

3772
01:55:04,431 --> 01:55:07,640
diabetes than it looks like
evil in the present case.

3773
01:55:08,180 --> 01:55:10,460
And people aren't imagining
what it would like.

3774
01:55:10,640 --> 01:55:12,050
What would it be like to be there?

3775
01:55:12,080 --> 01:55:16,310
What it would be like to actually
fully understand the under underlying

3776
01:55:16,311 --> 01:55:18,590
neurophysiology here and
actually have something.

3777
01:55:18,591 --> 01:55:18,741
I mean,

3778
01:55:18,741 --> 01:55:18,840
it's,

3779
01:55:18,840 --> 01:55:20,210
there's no guarantee you will be able to,

3780
01:55:20,390 --> 01:55:23,030
to deal with it in a simple way.

3781
01:55:23,031 --> 01:55:25,040
But it's certainly possible.

3782
01:55:25,510 --> 01:55:26,343
Um,

3783
01:55:26,390 --> 01:55:30,680
and I mean the classic example is just
like the Charles Whitman example where

3784
01:55:30,681 --> 01:55:30,841
you know,

3785
01:55:30,841 --> 01:55:33,650
you have a brain tumor that's
causing this aberrant behavior.

3786
01:55:34,040 --> 01:55:34,671
In that case,

3787
01:55:34,671 --> 01:55:35,504
everyone,

3788
01:55:35,660 --> 01:55:36,740
everyone sees,

3789
01:55:36,741 --> 01:55:37,041
okay,

3790
01:55:37,041 --> 01:55:38,480
this is not evil.

3791
01:55:38,510 --> 01:55:39,500
This is a brain tumor,

3792
01:55:39,530 --> 01:55:43,800
that's the tower shooter games
back in [inaudible] 64 I think.

3793
01:55:46,350 --> 01:55:47,220
And so,

3794
01:55:47,850 --> 01:55:49,890
but in the same way that a brain,

3795
01:55:49,891 --> 01:55:52,080
tuber tumors exculpatory there,

3796
01:55:52,081 --> 01:55:57,081
I think a full understanding of the
underlying neurology would be exculpatory

3797
01:55:58,830 --> 01:55:59,161
again.

3798
01:55:59,161 --> 01:56:01,040
It doesn't mean you in the meantime,

3799
01:56:01,160 --> 01:56:01,440
you know,

3800
01:56:01,440 --> 01:56:02,191
before we get there,

3801
01:56:02,191 --> 01:56:05,940
we have obviously we have to lock up
dangerous people if there's no way to to

3802
01:56:05,941 --> 01:56:06,600
help them.

3803
01:56:06,600 --> 01:56:09,960
But the more we see the causes,

3804
01:56:10,500 --> 01:56:11,370
the more we view.

3805
01:56:11,430 --> 01:56:16,080
We view this in terms
of just sheer bad luck,

3806
01:56:16,230 --> 01:56:16,610
right?

3807
01:56:16,610 --> 01:56:17,460
Like there are,

3808
01:56:17,510 --> 01:56:18,750
there are people who,

3809
01:56:18,960 --> 01:56:22,170
when they're adults are
quintessentially evil,

3810
01:56:22,410 --> 01:56:22,920
who we've,

3811
01:56:22,920 --> 01:56:23,531
who and they,

3812
01:56:23,531 --> 01:56:23,700
they,

3813
01:56:23,700 --> 01:56:26,250
they provoked the greatest
feeling of engines from us.

3814
01:56:26,790 --> 01:56:28,650
But if you just walked
back there timeline,

3815
01:56:29,280 --> 01:56:32,430
you recognize that at a certain they
were four years old at one point,

3816
01:56:32,690 --> 01:56:32,970
right?

3817
01:56:32,970 --> 01:56:37,590
They were the four year old who was
destined to become this terrible person.

3818
01:56:38,040 --> 01:56:39,380
It's an unlucky four year old,

3819
01:56:39,770 --> 01:56:40,090
you know,

3820
01:56:40,090 --> 01:56:41,520
and so at what point,

3821
01:56:41,521 --> 01:56:43,110
where's the bright line that says,

3822
01:56:43,560 --> 01:56:43,861
okay,

3823
01:56:43,861 --> 01:56:48,720
here's the point where it's appropriate
to just hate this person and feel no

3824
01:56:48,721 --> 01:56:51,840
compassion and it on the
other side of this line,

3825
01:56:52,170 --> 01:56:54,480
you should just feel compassion
because this person's unlucky.

3826
01:56:54,930 --> 01:56:59,930
There is no such line and a complete
understanding of this lifeline in,

3827
01:57:01,110 --> 01:57:06,000
in scientific terms would obliterate
any line you think you have.

3828
01:57:06,120 --> 01:57:06,420
Right?

3829
01:57:06,420 --> 01:57:10,170
It would just be this cascade
of causation and you know,

3830
01:57:10,171 --> 01:57:12,120
adding randomness to the
picture doesn't help,

3831
01:57:12,121 --> 01:57:12,301
right?

3832
01:57:12,301 --> 01:57:12,571
It's just,

3833
01:57:12,571 --> 01:57:13,770
it's the randomness is just,

3834
01:57:13,771 --> 01:57:13,891
you know,

3835
01:57:13,891 --> 01:57:17,430
somebody is in your brain rolling dice
and all influencing your behavior that

3836
01:57:17,431 --> 01:57:17,700
way.

3837
01:57:17,700 --> 01:57:17,881
Well,

3838
01:57:17,881 --> 01:57:18,140
that's,

3839
01:57:18,140 --> 01:57:19,590
that doesn't give you the free will.

3840
01:57:19,591 --> 01:57:20,401
People think they have.

3841
01:57:20,401 --> 01:57:21,720
So there isn't.

3842
01:57:21,750 --> 01:57:23,040
There's A.

3843
01:57:23,070 --> 01:57:23,903
Ironically,

3844
01:57:24,560 --> 01:57:26,670
there is what seems

3845
01:57:28,200 --> 01:57:30,880
on some level deflationary of the,

3846
01:57:30,980 --> 01:57:31,813
of the,

3847
01:57:31,920 --> 01:57:32,753
the,

3848
01:57:33,030 --> 01:57:33,650
the,

3849
01:57:33,650 --> 01:57:38,650
the Gravitas of the human spirit
for people opens the door to,

3850
01:57:38,900 --> 01:57:39,870
at least in my view,

3851
01:57:39,871 --> 01:57:44,871
a far more ethical and tolerant and
patient and understanding view of,

3852
01:57:46,140 --> 01:57:46,590
of,

3853
01:57:46,590 --> 01:57:46,771
you know,

3854
01:57:46,771 --> 01:57:50,160
human failings and human frailty and,

3855
01:57:50,170 --> 01:57:50,620
and just.

3856
01:57:50,620 --> 01:57:54,930
And then at that point you can just have
a conversation about what's pragmatic,

3857
01:57:54,931 --> 01:57:55,501
what works,

3858
01:57:55,501 --> 01:57:56,910
what helps people change.

3859
01:57:57,070 --> 01:57:57,570
Like in this,

3860
01:57:57,570 --> 01:57:59,430
this person over here who's
doing terrible things,

3861
01:57:59,880 --> 01:58:02,730
is there something we can do
to make him a better person?

3862
01:58:02,790 --> 01:58:03,210
Well,

3863
01:58:03,210 --> 01:58:03,961
if there is less,

3864
01:58:03,961 --> 01:58:05,670
do that without all the judgment.

3865
01:58:06,600 --> 01:58:10,890
Wouldn't it be amazing if that's how
we treated these public shaming events?

3866
01:58:10,891 --> 01:58:11,041
Like,

3867
01:58:11,041 --> 01:58:11,341
wouldn't,

3868
01:58:11,341 --> 01:58:15,000
wouldn't it be amazing if we gave
someone an opportunity to say,

3869
01:58:15,150 --> 01:58:15,900
this is,

3870
01:58:15,900 --> 01:58:17,640
this is what I did,

3871
01:58:17,670 --> 01:58:20,040
this is how awful I feel about this.

3872
01:58:20,310 --> 01:58:21,510
I would never do that again.

3873
01:58:21,511 --> 01:58:22,350
I'm a different person.

3874
01:58:22,351 --> 01:58:23,310
That was 20 years ago,

3875
01:58:23,311 --> 01:58:24,144
whatever it was,

3876
01:58:24,360 --> 01:58:25,020
and,

3877
01:58:25,020 --> 01:58:26,610
and have everybody join in.

3878
01:58:26,640 --> 01:58:27,473
Hey,

3879
01:58:27,810 --> 01:58:29,520
anyone could be you.

3880
01:58:29,670 --> 01:58:32,250
Thank you for being honest
about who you are now.

3881
01:58:32,251 --> 01:58:33,570
Thank you for evolving.

3882
01:58:33,571 --> 01:58:36,540
Thank you for expressing yourself in a
way that maybe other people who have also

3883
01:58:36,541 --> 01:58:37,860
committed really,

3884
01:58:37,940 --> 01:58:42,670
I'm just unsavory or just unfortunate

3885
01:58:42,670 --> 01:58:43,900
things in the past,

3886
01:58:43,901 --> 01:58:45,010
unfortunately acts in the past.

3887
01:58:45,011 --> 01:58:49,210
They can feel relieved by the fact that
you've grown and evolved to become a

3888
01:58:49,211 --> 01:58:51,070
better person and that you're a,

3889
01:58:51,080 --> 01:58:54,310
you're a different thing now and you are
the product of all of your experiences.

3890
01:58:54,311 --> 01:58:54,641
You're not,

3891
01:58:54,641 --> 01:58:55,930
you're not this one thing.

3892
01:58:55,931 --> 01:58:58,930
You're not stuck in who you
were when you were 16 years old.

3893
01:58:58,990 --> 01:59:01,690
If you were mark and mark and
you hit that guy with a stick,

3894
01:59:01,960 --> 01:59:02,570
whatever,

3895
01:59:02,570 --> 01:59:03,181
whatever he did,

3896
01:59:03,181 --> 01:59:03,360
you didn't.

3897
01:59:03,360 --> 01:59:05,980
You're not stuck in that spot for ever.

3898
01:59:06,570 --> 01:59:08,110
It's not a scarlet letter.

3899
01:59:08,410 --> 01:59:11,050
It's not a mark on your
forehead that you keep for life.

3900
01:59:11,740 --> 01:59:11,930
Yeah.

3901
01:59:11,930 --> 01:59:14,280
But the thing about the
Liam Neeson incident,

3902
01:59:14,281 --> 01:59:18,410
which I find so interesting is
that there's a case where they,

3903
01:59:18,720 --> 01:59:20,790
what he's revealing about himself is,

3904
01:59:20,970 --> 01:59:22,380
is pretty amazing,

3905
01:59:22,530 --> 01:59:22,831
right?

3906
01:59:22,831 --> 01:59:23,101
It's like,

3907
01:59:23,101 --> 01:59:24,190
it's like he,

3908
01:59:24,220 --> 01:59:25,830
he just decided,

3909
01:59:25,831 --> 01:59:26,180
okay,

3910
01:59:26,180 --> 01:59:27,140
we need a,

3911
01:59:27,470 --> 01:59:30,780
a truth and Reconciliation
Commission for who I used to be.

3912
01:59:30,810 --> 01:59:31,111
Right.

3913
01:59:31,111 --> 01:59:31,740
You know,

3914
01:59:31,740 --> 01:59:32,573
and,

3915
01:59:32,930 --> 01:59:33,763
uh,

3916
01:59:33,870 --> 01:59:35,070
just volunteered this.

3917
01:59:35,130 --> 01:59:36,030
And for me,

3918
01:59:36,031 --> 01:59:36,864
like I like,

3919
01:59:37,160 --> 01:59:37,993
you know,

3920
01:59:39,110 --> 01:59:41,400
I don't actually understand
that state of mind.

3921
01:59:41,401 --> 01:59:43,980
I mean there are many abrons states
of mind that I can understand.

3922
01:59:43,981 --> 01:59:45,180
I certainly understand what it's like to,

3923
01:59:45,280 --> 01:59:47,570
to want to harm somebody and uh,

3924
01:59:47,571 --> 01:59:47,821
you know,

3925
01:59:47,821 --> 01:59:49,440
to feel vengeance and all that.

3926
01:59:49,441 --> 01:59:51,630
But the instrumental violence piece,

3927
01:59:51,631 --> 01:59:52,351
I don't understand.

3928
01:59:52,351 --> 01:59:53,460
I've never felt like,

3929
01:59:54,240 --> 01:59:54,721
okay,

3930
01:59:54,721 --> 01:59:58,170
this type of person wronged
me or someone close to me.

3931
01:59:58,440 --> 02:00:02,520
So anytime any person of that
type will do right like that.

3932
02:00:02,730 --> 02:00:05,010
But that is such a problem,

3933
02:00:05,580 --> 02:00:08,760
the world over in human
history that it is,

3934
02:00:09,180 --> 02:00:11,250
it is just fascinating ethically,

3935
02:00:11,280 --> 02:00:16,140
for someone of his stature
to reveal that about himself.

3936
02:00:16,140 --> 02:00:17,160
And he put it in terms of,

3937
02:00:17,190 --> 02:00:18,023
of,

3938
02:00:18,170 --> 02:00:18,781
of honor.

3939
02:00:18,781 --> 02:00:18,901
I mean,

3940
02:00:18,901 --> 02:00:19,350
it was,

3941
02:00:19,350 --> 02:00:19,921
it was an honor.

3942
02:00:19,921 --> 02:00:20,071
I mean,

3943
02:00:20,071 --> 02:00:20,520
this is what,

3944
02:00:20,520 --> 02:00:21,353
this is what,

3945
02:00:21,390 --> 02:00:23,640
what is so dysfunctional
about honor culture,

3946
02:00:23,700 --> 02:00:23,881
right?

3947
02:00:23,881 --> 02:00:24,510
This is what,

3948
02:00:24,510 --> 02:00:28,320
this is what we see more in the south
than anywhere else in the country.

3949
02:00:28,321 --> 02:00:31,860
And this is what you see basically
everywhere you go in the Middle East.

3950
02:00:32,410 --> 02:00:37,410
And this is what Islam inculcates to
a degree that's fairly unmatched in,

3951
02:00:37,640 --> 02:00:39,060
in its community.

3952
02:00:39,690 --> 02:00:41,700
This notion of honor is,

3953
02:00:41,940 --> 02:00:46,940
does link up with this tendency to find
satisfaction in instrumental violence

3954
02:00:48,961 --> 02:00:49,290
like,

3955
02:00:49,290 --> 02:00:50,270
but when you,

3956
02:00:50,300 --> 02:00:54,660
when you try to run that software on
my brain that just looks like madness,

3957
02:00:55,050 --> 02:00:55,231
right?

3958
02:00:55,231 --> 02:01:00,231
The idea that any other person will do
right of a certain type that's just,

3959
02:01:02,800 --> 02:01:03,190
you know,

3960
02:01:03,190 --> 02:01:03,591
like I,

3961
02:01:03,591 --> 02:01:06,540
I don't read that
resonates not at all right.

3962
02:01:06,570 --> 02:01:07,403
And so,

3963
02:01:07,690 --> 02:01:08,523
um,

3964
02:01:09,360 --> 02:01:13,830
it's just damn interested in the fact
that the lesson being taken from this

3965
02:01:13,831 --> 02:01:14,664
seems to be,

3966
02:01:16,290 --> 02:01:17,123
this is,

3967
02:01:18,170 --> 02:01:22,080
this should be the end of your career
for having talked about this in the way.

3968
02:01:22,170 --> 02:01:23,130
And again,

3969
02:01:23,150 --> 02:01:27,470
I apologize if there's some part of the
story that I've gotten wrong or I'm not

3970
02:01:27,480 --> 02:01:28,740
missing or missing,

3971
02:01:28,741 --> 02:01:33,690
but it seemed to me that he was
always counting this in the,

3972
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:36,720
the horror and amazement
appropriate to the,

3973
02:01:36,750 --> 02:01:40,840
to the disclosure like he can't
believe was inhabiting this state of

3974
02:01:40,880 --> 02:01:41,600
consciousness.

3975
02:01:41,600 --> 02:01:42,850
And you know,

3976
02:01:42,851 --> 02:01:44,930
it's just an amazing thing
to reveal about yourself.

3977
02:01:45,470 --> 02:01:46,760
So yeah,

3978
02:01:46,761 --> 02:01:48,410
and I'm sure he regrets
every second of it.

3979
02:01:48,411 --> 02:01:48,741
Yeah.

3980
02:01:48,741 --> 02:01:49,190
And that's,

3981
02:01:49,190 --> 02:01:50,900
that's the wrong fucking punchline.

3982
02:01:52,160 --> 02:01:54,890
The thing that should happen is

3983
02:01:56,810 --> 02:01:58,940
someone with a lot to lose,

3984
02:01:59,390 --> 02:02:00,440
should be able to say,

3985
02:02:00,470 --> 02:02:00,831
you know,

3986
02:02:00,831 --> 02:02:02,870
how ugly a human mind can be.

3987
02:02:02,960 --> 02:02:04,550
This is an experience I had,

3988
02:02:04,680 --> 02:02:05,000
right?

3989
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:07,730
This is who I was and you know,

3990
02:02:07,731 --> 02:02:10,220
how much I have to live for
and how much I have to lose.

3991
02:02:10,760 --> 02:02:14,030
We have to talk about this kind of mania.

3992
02:02:14,031 --> 02:02:15,860
They can get humming on a human brain,

3993
02:02:16,090 --> 02:02:16,410
right?

3994
02:02:16,410 --> 02:02:17,241
We see this eight.

3995
02:02:17,241 --> 02:02:18,440
Every time you open the paper,

3996
02:02:18,710 --> 02:02:21,080
you see someone in the
grip of this kind of thing.

3997
02:02:21,380 --> 02:02:21,960
Right?

3998
02:02:21,960 --> 02:02:23,300
It even happened to me,

3999
02:02:23,330 --> 02:02:23,900
right?

4000
02:02:23,900 --> 02:02:25,970
I think it was an amazing
conversation to start.

4001
02:02:25,971 --> 02:02:29,240
And the fact that the result is just,

4002
02:02:29,330 --> 02:02:29,720
you know,

4003
02:02:29,720 --> 02:02:30,553
in an,

4004
02:02:30,580 --> 02:02:32,120
an auto defay uh,

4005
02:02:32,150 --> 02:02:32,983
is,

4006
02:02:33,350 --> 02:02:33,920
is,

4007
02:02:33,920 --> 02:02:34,790
is the problem.

4008
02:02:34,791 --> 02:02:35,070
We're,

4009
02:02:35,070 --> 02:02:37,390
we're trying to fight our way through it.

4010
02:02:37,760 --> 02:02:38,271
Isn't it to.

4011
02:02:38,271 --> 02:02:39,560
Because there's too many voices.

4012
02:02:39,620 --> 02:02:40,010
I mean,

4013
02:02:40,010 --> 02:02:42,080
there's just so many people
that are reacting to it.

4014
02:02:42,081 --> 02:02:43,400
If he's dealing with,

4015
02:02:43,610 --> 02:02:46,310
he's not dealing with three
or four or five voices.

4016
02:02:46,311 --> 02:02:51,311
He's dealing with millions of people to
get to chime in on this and get a few

4017
02:02:52,160 --> 02:02:53,870
thousand of those people
that are furious at you.

4018
02:02:54,260 --> 02:02:54,570
You know,

4019
02:02:54,570 --> 02:02:57,560
like you were saying like it doesn't.

4020
02:02:57,950 --> 02:02:58,670
It doesn't.

4021
02:02:58,670 --> 02:02:59,503
That doesn't work.

4022
02:02:59,510 --> 02:03:02,720
I was just about to say I was going to
make a comparison to your podcast with

4023
02:03:02,721 --> 02:03:03,051
Jack,

4024
02:03:03,051 --> 02:03:05,300
but you're not listening to
them reading the comments,

4025
02:03:05,301 --> 02:03:06,770
but he's.

4026
02:03:07,010 --> 02:03:12,010
He's getting this gigantic signal
from a huge number of people you know.

4027
02:03:13,131 --> 02:03:15,740
So this is all over my google news feed.

4028
02:03:15,741 --> 02:03:16,910
I saw it on Yahoo.

4029
02:03:16,911 --> 02:03:21,650
I saw it in all these
different publications are
talking about Liam Neeson's

4030
02:03:21,651 --> 02:03:26,630
case and so then everybody starts timing
in and then the virtue signaling ratio

4031
02:03:26,631 --> 02:03:29,880
is very high and the anger ratio is very
high than the people that think he's

4032
02:03:29,881 --> 02:03:32,870
secretly still racist and doesn't
want to admit it is very high.

4033
02:03:33,320 --> 02:03:36,350
And then there's also the fact that he's
a man of wealth and privilege and he's

4034
02:03:36,351 --> 02:03:39,560
successful and famous and there's got to
be a bunch of jealousy that's attached

4035
02:03:39,561 --> 02:03:42,080
to that and a bunch of people that want
to knock him down because he's at a very

4036
02:03:42,081 --> 02:03:42,914
high hill.

4037
02:03:43,110 --> 02:03:43,740
Yeah.

4038
02:03:43,740 --> 02:03:45,020
It was a lot going on there.

4039
02:03:46,680 --> 02:03:47,310
And I,

4040
02:03:47,310 --> 02:03:47,780
I,

4041
02:03:47,780 --> 02:03:48,613
um,

4042
02:03:48,700 --> 02:03:49,100
I don't know.

4043
02:03:49,100 --> 02:03:49,400
I feel,

4044
02:03:49,400 --> 02:03:50,450
I feel for the guy,

4045
02:03:50,451 --> 02:03:50,721
again,

4046
02:03:50,721 --> 02:03:51,171
I don't know him,

4047
02:03:51,171 --> 02:03:51,800
but I just,

4048
02:03:51,800 --> 02:03:52,790
I remember,

4049
02:03:53,610 --> 02:03:54,201
and again,

4050
02:03:54,201 --> 02:03:55,610
forgive me if I get this slightly wrong,

4051
02:03:55,611 --> 02:03:58,610
but isn't it true that his wife,

4052
02:03:58,670 --> 02:04:02,930
Natasha Richardson just died in this
freak accident that she's a skiing

4053
02:04:02,931 --> 02:04:03,470
accident?

4054
02:04:03,470 --> 02:04:04,370
Fell and hit her head.

4055
02:04:04,371 --> 02:04:04,870
But,

4056
02:04:04,870 --> 02:04:05,900
but honestly,

4057
02:04:06,050 --> 02:04:06,940
she didn't even fall.

4058
02:04:07,220 --> 02:04:08,990
She wasn't moving when she fell.

4059
02:04:08,991 --> 02:04:13,970
She was standing on a ski slope and fell
from a standing position and hit her

4060
02:04:13,971 --> 02:04:14,370
head on the,

4061
02:04:14,370 --> 02:04:14,660
you know,

4062
02:04:14,660 --> 02:04:16,160
the hard snow obviously.

4063
02:04:16,730 --> 02:04:19,010
And I mean it's just,

4064
02:04:19,150 --> 02:04:19,841
it's all it takes.

4065
02:04:19,841 --> 02:04:20,400
Yeah,

4066
02:04:20,400 --> 02:04:21,070
it's brutal.

4067
02:04:21,070 --> 02:04:21,740
Um,

4068
02:04:21,740 --> 02:04:22,070
yeah.

4069
02:04:22,070 --> 02:04:22,903
So,

4070
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:23,840
and on top of that,

4071
02:04:23,841 --> 02:04:26,480
I believe his cousin or his nephew,

4072
02:04:26,750 --> 02:04:27,800
nephew or niece,

4073
02:04:28,070 --> 02:04:29,090
died the same way.

4074
02:04:29,930 --> 02:04:31,760
Not the same way in terms of fell skiing.

4075
02:04:31,761 --> 02:04:33,200
But also hit their head and ride.

4076
02:04:33,260 --> 02:04:33,650
Wow.

4077
02:04:33,650 --> 02:04:37,830
So it was like Jesus Christ is this guy
and obviously there's many people out

4078
02:04:37,831 --> 02:04:38,070
there that

4079
02:04:38,070 --> 02:04:39,780
are experienced at far greater tragedy.

4080
02:04:39,820 --> 02:04:41,550
I'm not trying to quantify it,

4081
02:04:41,551 --> 02:04:42,810
but yeah,

4082
02:04:42,811 --> 02:04:43,644
he's,

4083
02:04:43,740 --> 02:04:44,190
you know,

4084
02:04:44,190 --> 02:04:44,660
he,

4085
02:04:44,660 --> 02:04:46,230
he tried to talk about a real thing,

4086
02:04:46,370 --> 02:04:46,760
you know,

4087
02:04:46,760 --> 02:04:48,060
and tried to talk about a real thing.

4088
02:04:48,061 --> 02:04:48,300
And,

4089
02:04:48,300 --> 02:04:49,133
and he's,

4090
02:04:49,380 --> 02:04:52,440
he's given some interviews
since then where he's,

4091
02:04:52,441 --> 02:04:52,640
you know,

4092
02:04:52,640 --> 02:04:53,031
he said,

4093
02:04:53,031 --> 02:04:53,281
I'll look,

4094
02:04:53,281 --> 02:04:54,210
I'm not a racist,

4095
02:04:54,211 --> 02:04:57,630
I'm just telling you I was in such a
fucked up state of mind because of this

4096
02:04:57,631 --> 02:05:00,270
rate that I was willing to do
something irrational and horrible,

4097
02:05:01,510 --> 02:05:02,343
but he didn't know,

4098
02:05:02,380 --> 02:05:03,060
but he didn't.

4099
02:05:03,060 --> 02:05:03,450
Interesting.

4100
02:05:03,450 --> 02:05:03,601
Yeah,

4101
02:05:03,601 --> 02:05:03,981
exactly.

4102
02:05:03,981 --> 02:05:04,290
Yeah.

4103
02:05:04,290 --> 02:05:04,630
But,

4104
02:05:04,630 --> 02:05:05,820
and again,

4105
02:05:05,821 --> 02:05:08,040
it will take it full circle people.

4106
02:05:08,041 --> 02:05:12,810
These same people who are calling for
his head are prepared to forgive other

4107
02:05:12,811 --> 02:05:14,700
people who did do that thing.

4108
02:05:15,420 --> 02:05:16,470
It's so dependent.

4109
02:05:16,471 --> 02:05:19,530
Like I had Mike Tyson on the podcast
and one of the things that I got when I

4110
02:05:19,531 --> 02:05:20,430
said it was on part of my,

4111
02:05:20,450 --> 02:05:21,030
that was fast.

4112
02:05:21,030 --> 02:05:22,320
I've asked so many people were like,

4113
02:05:22,321 --> 02:05:23,640
fuck that rapist.

4114
02:05:23,641 --> 02:05:24,361
Fuck this guy.

4115
02:05:24,361 --> 02:05:25,010
Fuck that.

4116
02:05:25,010 --> 02:05:26,340
All these different things about him,

4117
02:05:26,700 --> 02:05:31,700
what I wanted to get into him with him
was who he was when he was 12 years old,

4118
02:05:32,910 --> 02:05:34,050
when he was a little boy,

4119
02:05:34,080 --> 02:05:38,580
when he met custom motto and was taught
out of box and was fucking hypnotized,

4120
02:05:38,820 --> 02:05:42,090
and this is one of the really important
things that came out of that podcast was

4121
02:05:42,091 --> 02:05:46,170
custom model who was not just this boxing
legend who took in this young kid from

4122
02:05:46,171 --> 02:05:47,520
the ghetto that didn't have a family,

4123
02:05:47,850 --> 02:05:49,830
but also hypnotized him.

4124
02:05:49,980 --> 02:05:51,720
Tip Man ties them to be a destroyer.

4125
02:05:51,800 --> 02:05:53,250
He specifically was saying to him,

4126
02:05:53,251 --> 02:05:54,270
you don't exist.

4127
02:05:54,420 --> 02:05:55,740
The task exists.

4128
02:05:55,950 --> 02:05:56,940
You're going to move forward.

4129
02:05:56,941 --> 02:05:58,740
You're going to Bob and
weave and rip the body,

4130
02:05:58,890 --> 02:06:03,890
and he was programming this kid to get
incredible amounts of positive response

4131
02:06:04,081 --> 02:06:05,640
from violent acts.

4132
02:06:05,910 --> 02:06:07,380
Violent acts in a boxing ring,

4133
02:06:07,381 --> 02:06:08,910
and that's where he got his identity.

4134
02:06:09,060 --> 02:06:12,630
That's where he got all of his love and
so he became this guy and one of the

4135
02:06:12,631 --> 02:06:13,351
things that I said to him,

4136
02:06:13,351 --> 02:06:14,184
I said,

4137
02:06:14,250 --> 02:06:16,470
did anybody ever teach teach
you how to turn it off?

4138
02:06:16,970 --> 02:06:17,590
And he's like,

4139
02:06:17,590 --> 02:06:18,080
no.

4140
02:06:18,080 --> 02:06:18,620
Nobody did.

4141
02:06:18,620 --> 02:06:19,220
Like,

4142
02:06:19,220 --> 02:06:19,790
I'm not.

4143
02:06:19,790 --> 02:06:22,500
I'm not Mike Tyson and
I was never like that.

4144
02:06:22,550 --> 02:06:23,341
I was never like that,

4145
02:06:23,341 --> 02:06:27,750
but I was far more violent when
I was fighting far more violent,

4146
02:06:27,960 --> 02:06:29,550
far more prone to violence.

4147
02:06:29,910 --> 02:06:33,750
It was my trigger was very short
because I was thinking about it all the

4148
02:06:34,170 --> 02:06:35,840
fighting all the time I fought.

4149
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:37,680
I probably had 100 fights.

4150
02:06:38,070 --> 02:06:39,330
I was ready to go.

4151
02:06:39,540 --> 02:06:40,141
Like your.

4152
02:06:40,141 --> 02:06:41,280
Your brain has a.

4153
02:06:41,290 --> 02:06:41,790
If you're.

4154
02:06:41,790 --> 02:06:45,630
If you're getting kicked in the face
and punched in the face a lot and you're

4155
02:06:45,631 --> 02:06:48,960
doing it through your developmental
period from the time you 50 for me was 15.

4156
02:06:48,960 --> 02:06:50,370
From him it was like 12 or 13.

4157
02:06:51,060 --> 02:06:55,740
You have a different way of looking at
the world because this is also in the

4158
02:06:55,741 --> 02:06:57,780
recipes in the recipes are also.

4159
02:06:57,781 --> 02:06:59,250
You might get knocked the fuck out.

4160
02:06:59,430 --> 02:07:00,720
You might get head kicked,

4161
02:07:00,900 --> 02:07:03,740
you might get kicked in the
neck with a Shin and you know,

4162
02:07:03,750 --> 02:07:06,660
you wake up and your friends are slapped
me in the face of putting ice on you.

4163
02:07:06,840 --> 02:07:09,750
This is all real and when you have that,

4164
02:07:10,450 --> 02:07:12,420
the positive that comes from that.

4165
02:07:12,421 --> 02:07:17,100
When you were a 12 year old boy and
you're hypnotized by this great man who's

4166
02:07:17,130 --> 02:07:19,590
teaching you how to fight and
you're getting so much love,

4167
02:07:19,591 --> 02:07:20,790
you've never gotten love in your life,

4168
02:07:20,940 --> 02:07:24,900
you've never gotten positive feedback and
you're getting so much of it from this

4169
02:07:25,170 --> 02:07:27,780
and then no one's teaching you how to
turn it off and you're wondering why this

4170
02:07:27,781 --> 02:07:31,110
guy would he grows up to become a
fucking maniac is punching people in the

4171
02:07:31,111 --> 02:07:31,510
street.

4172
02:07:31,510 --> 02:07:34,500
It's just just crazy and
yelling at reporters.

4173
02:07:34,501 --> 02:07:35,980
I'll fuck you in the ass white boy.

4174
02:07:35,980 --> 02:07:37,090
All that crazy shit that he did.

4175
02:07:37,470 --> 02:07:38,620
He was a maniac.

4176
02:07:38,680 --> 02:07:39,513
I mean there's no.

4177
02:07:39,610 --> 02:07:42,340
No one taught him how to reflect.

4178
02:07:42,430 --> 02:07:46,930
There was no Sam Harris App for
meditation for Mike Tyson in 1986.

4179
02:07:47,080 --> 02:07:47,350
You know,

4180
02:07:47,350 --> 02:07:48,490
he was just a maniac.

4181
02:07:50,220 --> 02:07:50,770
I mean,

4182
02:07:50,770 --> 02:07:55,770
one problem we have here is that we don't
have a norm around a good norm around

4183
02:07:57,281 --> 02:08:01,630
mental health and we have zero
norms around mental training.

4184
02:08:01,750 --> 02:08:01,931
Right?

4185
02:08:01,931 --> 02:08:02,764
So mean.

4186
02:08:02,840 --> 02:08:04,030
So physical training.

4187
02:08:04,730 --> 02:08:09,010
Very good analogy between
meditation as mental training,

4188
02:08:09,011 --> 02:08:12,010
which sounds just like esoteric and woo.

4189
02:08:12,320 --> 02:08:13,510
That sounds like new age,

4190
02:08:13,780 --> 02:08:15,820
specious nonsense to many people,

4191
02:08:16,420 --> 02:08:20,200
but if you roll back the clock
100 years physical training,

4192
02:08:20,830 --> 02:08:21,850
which made no sense,

4193
02:08:21,851 --> 02:08:25,090
there were no norms around him and the
only guy lifting a dumbbell was that guy

4194
02:08:25,091 --> 02:08:27,400
with the handlebar
mustache and the leopard,

4195
02:08:27,401 --> 02:08:27,730
you know,

4196
02:08:27,730 --> 02:08:28,570
Bikini or whatever.

4197
02:08:28,571 --> 02:08:30,190
He was wearing the freak show,

4198
02:08:30,191 --> 02:08:30,960
right?

4199
02:08:30,960 --> 02:08:31,793
The singlet.

4200
02:08:31,840 --> 02:08:32,673
Yeah.

4201
02:08:32,680 --> 02:08:34,830
And now we have a,

4202
02:08:34,930 --> 02:08:38,890
we have a total understanding of
the norms around physical training.

4203
02:08:38,980 --> 02:08:39,230
Like,

4204
02:08:39,230 --> 02:08:39,340
uh,

4205
02:08:39,340 --> 02:08:39,580
you're,

4206
02:08:39,580 --> 02:08:40,130
you're,

4207
02:08:40,130 --> 02:08:40,690
there's just,

4208
02:08:40,690 --> 02:08:43,300
you're actually a freak if you
don't do some kind of exercise.

4209
02:08:43,800 --> 02:08:47,320
They have even changed and evolved
over the last decade or so.

4210
02:08:47,650 --> 02:08:49,930
It's gotten far more
complicated in nuance.

4211
02:08:49,960 --> 02:08:50,950
It's continually evolving,

4212
02:08:50,951 --> 02:08:51,550
but the,

4213
02:08:51,550 --> 02:08:53,830
the framework that the paradigm,

4214
02:08:53,831 --> 02:08:58,180
the fact that there's something to
do to get better physically and that,

4215
02:08:58,181 --> 02:08:58,380
those,

4216
02:08:58,380 --> 02:09:00,250
those changes matter,

4217
02:09:00,540 --> 02:09:00,900
they,

4218
02:09:00,900 --> 02:09:01,650
they,

4219
02:09:01,650 --> 02:09:06,650
you can engage your body intelligently
so as to improve it in all across many

4220
02:09:06,791 --> 02:09:07,511
different variables.

4221
02:09:07,511 --> 02:09:08,231
Flexibility,

4222
02:09:08,231 --> 02:09:09,064
strength,

4223
02:09:09,390 --> 02:09:10,150
uh,

4224
02:09:10,150 --> 02:09:11,680
that's all totally understood.

4225
02:09:11,681 --> 02:09:16,240
And now we're just refining the
protocol with mental training,

4226
02:09:17,050 --> 02:09:17,450
uh,

4227
02:09:17,450 --> 02:09:22,450
and specifically the training of attention
and how you respond to the uprising

4228
02:09:26,591 --> 02:09:28,000
of your own negative emotion,

4229
02:09:28,210 --> 02:09:29,043
right?

4230
02:09:29,170 --> 02:09:32,200
That is something that has been
going on for thousands of years in

4231
02:09:32,201 --> 02:09:33,011
contemplative,

4232
02:09:33,011 --> 02:09:34,750
mostly eastern context.

4233
02:09:34,751 --> 02:09:35,291
And that's something that,

4234
02:09:35,291 --> 02:09:35,471
you know,

4235
02:09:35,471 --> 02:09:40,471
Buddhism really has a lot of specifically
an asymmetric amount of wisdom to,

4236
02:09:41,620 --> 02:09:41,951
to,

4237
02:09:41,951 --> 02:09:42,550
uh,

4238
02:09:42,550 --> 02:09:43,383
share on.

4239
02:09:43,690 --> 02:09:45,820
And it's,

4240
02:09:45,821 --> 02:09:46,654
um,

4241
02:09:46,900 --> 02:09:47,141
yeah,

4242
02:09:47,141 --> 02:09:47,381
I mean,

4243
02:09:47,381 --> 02:09:47,600
I'm,

4244
02:09:47,600 --> 02:09:48,340
I'm,

4245
02:09:48,340 --> 02:09:52,630
I'm very excited to be spending more
time on it because it's that the locus of

4246
02:09:52,631 --> 02:09:55,740
so much of the fragmentation or in
our lives now is the smartphone.

4247
02:09:55,890 --> 02:09:56,710
So what's happening,

4248
02:09:56,710 --> 02:09:57,160
what the,

4249
02:09:57,160 --> 02:10:02,160
what this thing is doing to
us is continually amplifying
not only our desire for

4250
02:10:04,491 --> 02:10:05,650
our approval,

4251
02:10:05,860 --> 02:10:10,860
but the ability to react in a like.

4252
02:10:11,530 --> 02:10:16,030
So there's just no reason to hesitate
to condemn this thing that you're seeing

4253
02:10:16,060 --> 02:10:17,320
like this.

4254
02:10:17,360 --> 02:10:20,650
This upwelling of negative emotion
you see the out of the outrage,

4255
02:10:20,651 --> 02:10:22,930
you feel when you see
something on twitter,

4256
02:10:23,350 --> 02:10:24,070
right?

4257
02:10:24,070 --> 02:10:24,903
Is,

4258
02:10:26,230 --> 02:10:28,000
it's shortening everybody's views,

4259
02:10:28,210 --> 02:10:28,511
right?

4260
02:10:28,511 --> 02:10:31,900
It's making road rage more of a
kind of a general feature of our,

4261
02:10:31,930 --> 02:10:32,763
of our lives.

4262
02:10:32,780 --> 02:10:34,300
And um,

4263
02:10:35,200 --> 02:10:35,660
this is,

4264
02:10:35,660 --> 02:10:36,800
this is all trainable,

4265
02:10:36,890 --> 02:10:38,120
like you can actually,

4266
02:10:38,121 --> 02:10:43,121
you can actually learn that when you
suddenly feel anger in response to

4267
02:10:43,401 --> 02:10:45,980
something that seems to
have happened in the world,

4268
02:10:47,210 --> 02:10:50,360
if you just pay attention
to the experience of anger,

4269
02:10:50,361 --> 02:10:51,290
he just feel the,

4270
02:10:51,350 --> 02:10:51,540
the,

4271
02:10:51,540 --> 02:10:51,730
the,

4272
02:10:51,730 --> 02:10:53,390
the mirror physiology of it.

4273
02:10:54,230 --> 02:10:55,690
And get out of your thoughts about it.

4274
02:10:56,180 --> 02:10:57,290
Like you actually,

4275
02:10:57,291 --> 02:10:59,060
you notice thought as a process,

4276
02:10:59,540 --> 02:11:00,380
you let that go.

4277
02:11:00,381 --> 02:11:03,680
You're not continuing to
have a conversation with
yourself about all the reasons

4278
02:11:03,681 --> 02:11:07,640
why you should be angry or you should
attack this person and you just become

4279
02:11:07,670 --> 02:11:08,503
interested in,

4280
02:11:08,600 --> 02:11:10,250
in anger as response.

4281
02:11:10,670 --> 02:11:14,240
The half life of the
emotion is like seconds,

4282
02:11:14,360 --> 02:11:14,541
right?

4283
02:11:14,541 --> 02:11:17,240
It's impossible to stay
angry for very long.

4284
02:11:17,270 --> 02:11:20,270
If you get out of the story you're
telling yourself about why you should be

4285
02:11:20,271 --> 02:11:20,601
angry.

4286
02:11:20,601 --> 02:11:23,300
Now there are certain
situations where anger is,

4287
02:11:23,360 --> 02:11:27,170
is appropriate and it's good
to have access to that energy.

4288
02:11:27,171 --> 02:11:27,560
I'm not,

4289
02:11:27,560 --> 02:11:31,660
I'm not advocating that everyone just
get labatt automized and not react to

4290
02:11:31,661 --> 02:11:32,091
anything.

4291
02:11:32,091 --> 02:11:37,091
But until you can actually be mindful.

4292
02:11:37,731 --> 02:11:40,670
I mean mindfulness is the
technical word for what this is.

4293
02:11:40,671 --> 02:11:42,860
And until you can actually get out of the,

4294
02:11:43,420 --> 02:11:46,160
the thoughts and just pay attention to,

4295
02:11:46,810 --> 02:11:47,643
to,

4296
02:11:47,660 --> 02:11:49,160
in this case a negative emotion,

4297
02:11:49,820 --> 02:11:50,870
you have zero choice.

4298
02:11:50,870 --> 02:11:53,840
You're gonna stay angry for as long as
you stay angry for and people have this

4299
02:11:53,841 --> 02:11:58,430
experience of being angry for days
about things or being angry for hours.

4300
02:11:58,970 --> 02:12:02,060
There's no way to stay angry
for more than moments if,

4301
02:12:02,090 --> 02:12:02,450
if,

4302
02:12:02,450 --> 02:12:04,400
unless you're just lost in the story.

4303
02:12:04,550 --> 02:12:05,600
And um,

4304
02:12:06,800 --> 02:12:08,790
it becomes a kind of superpower to,

4305
02:12:08,880 --> 02:12:10,130
to be able to say,

4306
02:12:11,300 --> 02:12:12,620
do I need to be angry about this?

4307
02:12:12,770 --> 02:12:15,470
Or like how useful is it
to stay angry about this?

4308
02:12:15,500 --> 02:12:15,711
And,

4309
02:12:15,711 --> 02:12:15,951
and,

4310
02:12:15,951 --> 02:12:18,290
and you can just get off the ride,

4311
02:12:18,620 --> 02:12:18,801
right?

4312
02:12:18,801 --> 02:12:19,401
You can literally,

4313
02:12:19,401 --> 02:12:19,980
like I,

4314
02:12:19,980 --> 02:12:24,830
I see a tweet from somebody who's trying
to destroy my life and I feel this

4315
02:12:24,920 --> 02:12:29,920
initial contraction and I can decide
how long I want to feel that way for.

4316
02:12:32,450 --> 02:12:32,751
Right?

4317
02:12:32,751 --> 02:12:35,000
And that's an amazing
thing to be able to do.

4318
02:12:35,030 --> 02:12:40,030
And it's based on a kind of training
that very few people know even exists and

4319
02:12:41,031 --> 02:12:41,180
that.

4320
02:12:41,180 --> 02:12:42,050
And so again,

4321
02:12:42,051 --> 02:12:42,741
it's like you're like,

4322
02:12:42,741 --> 02:12:43,850
I'm now the guy in the,

4323
02:12:43,910 --> 02:12:44,310
in the,

4324
02:12:44,310 --> 02:12:45,170
the Leopard singlet,

4325
02:12:45,171 --> 02:12:45,950
right?

4326
02:12:45,950 --> 02:12:46,701
But it's,

4327
02:12:46,701 --> 02:12:47,510
um,

4328
02:12:47,510 --> 02:12:47,691
you know,

4329
02:12:47,691 --> 02:12:48,511
more and more,

4330
02:12:48,511 --> 02:12:48,650
uh,

4331
02:12:48,650 --> 02:12:48,910
we're,

4332
02:12:48,910 --> 02:12:52,250
we're going to understand that this
is just has to be part of everybody's

4333
02:12:52,280 --> 02:12:53,113
toolkit.

4334
02:12:53,600 --> 02:12:53,961
Well,

4335
02:12:53,961 --> 02:12:56,630
it would be amazing if they
taught kids that in school,

4336
02:12:56,690 --> 02:12:59,330
if you have to learn that when
you're learning math and history,

4337
02:12:59,331 --> 02:12:59,991
people are doing that.

4338
02:12:59,991 --> 02:13:03,100
But my wife actually does
that really in high school.

4339
02:13:03,810 --> 02:13:04,520
Six-Year-Olds.

4340
02:13:04,520 --> 02:13:05,420
Whoa.

4341
02:13:05,450 --> 02:13:05,930
You can teach,

4342
02:13:05,930 --> 02:13:07,880
you can teach mindfulness to.

4343
02:13:07,930 --> 02:13:09,440
I mean in the beginning,

4344
02:13:10,520 --> 02:13:14,680
what they're learning is
just basic awareness of their
inner lives are like just

4345
02:13:14,690 --> 02:13:19,690
being able to name the emotion they're
feeling is an amazing capacity and a six

4346
02:13:20,781 --> 02:13:25,781
year old and a six year old is just acting
out something and you're now teaching

4347
02:13:25,881 --> 02:13:26,510
them to,

4348
02:13:26,510 --> 02:13:31,510
to know in that moment that what's pushing
them from behind his sadness or anger

4349
02:13:33,630 --> 02:13:35,130
or embarrassment or cycling.

4350
02:13:35,160 --> 02:13:39,330
Just to be able to have that
recursive ability to reflect.

4351
02:13:40,980 --> 02:13:42,600
That's already a major gain in,

4352
02:13:42,601 --> 02:13:43,110
in,

4353
02:13:43,110 --> 02:13:43,880
in,

4354
02:13:43,880 --> 02:13:44,011
uh,

4355
02:13:44,011 --> 02:13:44,731
kids that age.

4356
02:13:44,731 --> 02:13:44,971
But yeah,

4357
02:13:44,971 --> 02:13:46,110
you can learn it very early.

4358
02:13:46,130 --> 02:13:46,471
I actually,

4359
02:13:46,471 --> 02:13:50,370
this was something I was talking
about with Stephen Fry on,

4360
02:13:50,430 --> 02:13:53,750
on my podcast as Steven
was very scared and he,

4361
02:13:53,751 --> 02:13:54,031
he's,

4362
02:13:54,031 --> 02:13:54,864
he's actually,

4363
02:13:55,380 --> 02:13:56,040
he's adorable.

4364
02:13:56,040 --> 02:13:57,930
He's starting the blog cast.

4365
02:13:57,931 --> 02:14:00,240
I really enjoyed that is just,

4366
02:14:00,780 --> 02:14:03,210
you're in the presence
of just such a nice guy.

4367
02:14:03,260 --> 02:14:05,580
Guys radiates you no decency.

4368
02:14:05,950 --> 02:14:06,783
Um,

4369
02:14:06,930 --> 02:14:07,763
but uh,

4370
02:14:07,770 --> 02:14:08,130
he was,

4371
02:14:08,130 --> 02:14:08,340
you know,

4372
02:14:08,340 --> 02:14:09,660
fairly skeptical of just like,

4373
02:14:09,661 --> 02:14:13,070
why would you ever have to train
mindfulness or meditation and I mean,

4374
02:14:13,080 --> 02:14:16,170
the analogy that came up came up to me,

4375
02:14:16,230 --> 02:14:20,460
he came up for me on the fly there was
that it is actually a lot like learning

4376
02:14:20,461 --> 02:14:24,380
to read in the sense that none
of us remember having the,

4377
02:14:24,870 --> 02:14:27,390
having gone through the ordeal
of learning to read right now,

4378
02:14:27,391 --> 02:14:29,280
that learning to read was a hassle,

4379
02:14:29,430 --> 02:14:29,640
right?

4380
02:14:29,640 --> 02:14:34,020
Like that did not come easily to most
people and he had now is just now you,

4381
02:14:34,021 --> 02:14:37,890
if you look at a page of text in a
language you understand you can't help but

4382
02:14:37,891 --> 02:14:38,490
decode it,

4383
02:14:38,490 --> 02:14:38,701
right?

4384
02:14:38,701 --> 02:14:39,534
It's just effortless.

4385
02:14:40,140 --> 02:14:40,800
And so,

4386
02:14:40,800 --> 02:14:41,041
I mean,

4387
02:14:41,041 --> 02:14:45,930
this is these kinds of emotional
tools and cognitive tools,

4388
02:14:45,931 --> 02:14:46,231
just the,

4389
02:14:46,231 --> 02:14:49,380
the ability to self regulate emotion in,

4390
02:14:49,620 --> 02:14:51,570
by becoming aware of it as a process,

4391
02:14:52,180 --> 02:14:52,740
uh,

4392
02:14:52,740 --> 02:14:57,210
that is something that I think we could
teach kids much earlier and then we

4393
02:14:57,211 --> 02:14:58,740
would be in the presence of,

4394
02:14:58,800 --> 02:15:02,670
of young adults who would
naturally have a facility,

4395
02:15:02,671 --> 02:15:04,620
a facility for it that,

4396
02:15:04,680 --> 02:15:05,490
where they won't even,

4397
02:15:05,490 --> 02:15:07,770
they wouldn't even remember
how hard it was to acquire it.

4398
02:15:08,380 --> 02:15:08,730
Yeah.

4399
02:15:08,730 --> 02:15:11,380
What it was talking about earlier
with Mike Tyson and you know,

4400
02:15:11,520 --> 02:15:12,270
his,

4401
02:15:12,270 --> 02:15:13,920
his coaching and his,

4402
02:15:14,280 --> 02:15:18,840
I mean he essentially got mental
coaching on how to accomplish one thing,

4403
02:15:19,070 --> 02:15:22,770
a mental coaching on how to have
the perfect mindset for one thing.

4404
02:15:22,770 --> 02:15:23,100
How to,

4405
02:15:23,100 --> 02:15:23,790
how to,

4406
02:15:23,790 --> 02:15:24,870
how to kick people's ass.

4407
02:15:25,550 --> 02:15:29,340
What he didn't have was mental coaching
on how to deal with the pressures of

4408
02:15:29,341 --> 02:15:29,970
life,

4409
02:15:29,970 --> 02:15:30,930
especially live.

4410
02:15:30,931 --> 02:15:31,190
I mean,

4411
02:15:31,190 --> 02:15:35,460
and almost no one really understands
what life is like to be a famous 20 year

4412
02:15:35,461 --> 02:15:37,470
old heavyweight champion of the world.

4413
02:15:37,530 --> 02:15:37,950
I mean,

4414
02:15:37,950 --> 02:15:40,120
there's no one had to be salient.

4415
02:15:40,220 --> 02:15:40,470
Yeah.

4416
02:15:40,470 --> 02:15:41,310
It's got to be alien.

4417
02:15:41,550 --> 02:15:46,140
I mean at the end to ask this kid to
manage this state when you know you're

4418
02:15:46,141 --> 02:15:51,141
talking about someone who just six years
prior was virtually homeless and had no

4419
02:15:52,141 --> 02:15:57,141
love in his life at all and was being
hypnotized by some madman who a,

4420
02:15:57,640 --> 02:15:57,931
you know,

4421
02:15:57,931 --> 02:16:02,931
a boxing wizard who lives in the catskills
and did what we were talking about

4422
02:16:03,031 --> 02:16:07,380
earlier about who you are
now versus who you were 20,

4423
02:16:07,381 --> 02:16:09,390
30 years ago when you meet Mike Tyson.

4424
02:16:09,750 --> 02:16:11,430
Mike Tyson is the sweetest,

4425
02:16:11,460 --> 02:16:12,121
nicest,

4426
02:16:12,121 --> 02:16:13,140
friendliest guy.

4427
02:16:13,350 --> 02:16:14,790
He's so soft spoken.

4428
02:16:15,000 --> 02:16:16,170
He's really kind.

4429
02:16:16,171 --> 02:16:17,250
He hugs people.

4430
02:16:17,430 --> 02:16:18,660
He's a really nice guy,

4431
02:16:18,990 --> 02:16:19,321
you know,

4432
02:16:19,321 --> 02:16:22,680
and at one point in time he was the
scariest motherfucker on the planet earth.

4433
02:16:23,610 --> 02:16:23,881
Yeah.

4434
02:16:23,881 --> 02:16:24,421
There's actually,

4435
02:16:24,421 --> 02:16:27,210
there's another sort of
uncanny valley here in,

4436
02:16:27,300 --> 02:16:31,570
in martial arts training that I spend a
lot of time in when you're training in

4437
02:16:31,571 --> 02:16:36,571
martial arts and seeing the world through
this lens of violence and potential

4438
02:16:36,641 --> 02:16:37,121
violence,

4439
02:16:37,121 --> 02:16:41,560
but you're training in a way that's
never really putting your skills to the

4440
02:16:41,561 --> 02:16:41,981
test.

4441
02:16:41,981 --> 02:16:42,400
So you're,

4442
02:16:42,400 --> 02:16:43,121
you're basically,

4443
02:16:43,121 --> 02:16:43,810
you're as a,

4444
02:16:43,810 --> 02:16:44,830
as a young man,

4445
02:16:45,370 --> 02:16:48,910
you're living with this fundamental
uncertainty as to whether or not you

4446
02:16:48,911 --> 02:16:50,530
actually are capable of anything.

4447
02:16:50,750 --> 02:16:52,540
So you're training like fake martial arts,

4448
02:16:52,541 --> 02:16:52,701
right?

4449
02:16:52,701 --> 02:16:53,380
Right.

4450
02:16:53,380 --> 02:16:57,850
Or at least martial arts where most of
it is it kind of pantomime of violence

4451
02:16:57,851 --> 02:16:58,930
and it's not being pressured,

4452
02:16:58,931 --> 02:16:59,261
tested.

4453
02:16:59,261 --> 02:17:00,280
So it's not like you were,

4454
02:17:00,281 --> 02:17:02,800
you're competing and you know what it's
like to kick someone in the head and it

4455
02:17:02,801 --> 02:17:03,431
actually works,

4456
02:17:03,431 --> 02:17:03,670
right?

4457
02:17:03,670 --> 02:17:05,590
It's like this is your sparring,

4458
02:17:05,591 --> 02:17:06,550
but it's all,

4459
02:17:06,940 --> 02:17:08,020
you have to keep everything safe.

4460
02:17:08,050 --> 02:17:08,321
Right.

4461
02:17:08,321 --> 02:17:09,154
You know,

4462
02:17:09,160 --> 02:17:09,993
um,

4463
02:17:10,090 --> 02:17:11,200
or even if it's full contact,

4464
02:17:11,201 --> 02:17:13,750
you have headgear and you've
got this just like you're not.

4465
02:17:13,780 --> 02:17:18,100
There's still basic uncertainty about
what's going to go down on the street,

4466
02:17:18,101 --> 02:17:18,370
if,

4467
02:17:18,370 --> 02:17:18,970
you know,

4468
02:17:18,970 --> 02:17:22,510
if it's in the presence of real
violence and they are your,

4469
02:17:23,310 --> 02:17:23,690
you know,

4470
02:17:23,690 --> 02:17:25,060
especially as a teenager,

4471
02:17:25,540 --> 02:17:30,540
you're in this fairly toxic state of like
sort of always preparing for violence

4472
02:17:31,301 --> 02:17:32,134
that is still is in,

4473
02:17:32,170 --> 02:17:32,480
you know,

4474
02:17:32,480 --> 02:17:33,580
in most people's lives,

4475
02:17:33,970 --> 02:17:36,820
a pretty low order of probability
that it's going to occur.

4476
02:17:37,450 --> 02:17:38,110
Uh,

4477
02:17:38,110 --> 02:17:40,030
and yet it's all,

4478
02:17:40,150 --> 02:17:42,850
it's also backed by this fear of,

4479
02:17:43,690 --> 02:17:43,991
you know,

4480
02:17:43,991 --> 02:17:47,660
you just kind of the ego fear of maybe
you're just full of Shit and you're just

4481
02:17:47,670 --> 02:17:47,840
here,

4482
02:17:47,840 --> 02:17:48,940
you're just gonna get your ass kicked.

4483
02:17:48,941 --> 02:17:49,990
If this ever happens.

4484
02:17:49,991 --> 02:17:51,430
And with someone like,

4485
02:17:51,450 --> 02:17:51,850
you know,

4486
02:17:51,850 --> 02:17:52,790
someone who's a real,

4487
02:17:53,320 --> 02:17:54,580
obviously someone like Mike Tyson,

4488
02:17:55,150 --> 02:17:55,870
there shouldn't,

4489
02:17:55,870 --> 02:17:58,780
there shouldn't be any
uncertainty about like,

4490
02:17:58,781 --> 02:18:00,640
he's got nothing to prove these in a bar.

4491
02:18:00,640 --> 02:18:01,391
And somebody says,

4492
02:18:01,391 --> 02:18:01,630
you know,

4493
02:18:01,630 --> 02:18:02,463
what are you looking at?

4494
02:18:03,130 --> 02:18:06,550
At minimum he doesn't have
this fear of like if he,

4495
02:18:06,551 --> 02:18:08,380
if he walks away from that challenge,

4496
02:18:08,830 --> 02:18:10,780
he knows he's walking away,

4497
02:18:10,900 --> 02:18:12,250
not because he was scared,

4498
02:18:12,251 --> 02:18:12,790
maybe he,

4499
02:18:12,790 --> 02:18:14,440
he's going to lose a
fistfight with this guy,

4500
02:18:14,441 --> 02:18:14,681
right?

4501
02:18:14,681 --> 02:18:16,360
He's the best boxer on
earth at that moment.

4502
02:18:16,840 --> 02:18:17,270
It's,

4503
02:18:17,270 --> 02:18:18,280
it's that he's,

4504
02:18:18,350 --> 02:18:18,730
he's,

4505
02:18:18,730 --> 02:18:20,500
he's got way more to
lose than the other guy.

4506
02:18:20,530 --> 02:18:21,010
Like I felt like,

4507
02:18:21,010 --> 02:18:23,890
why does he want to be rolling around
in the parking lot with some stranger,

4508
02:18:23,891 --> 02:18:24,640
you know.

4509
02:18:24,640 --> 02:18:25,450
So,

4510
02:18:25,450 --> 02:18:26,283
um,

4511
02:18:26,710 --> 02:18:27,543
it's a.

4512
02:18:27,610 --> 02:18:28,230
So there's this,

4513
02:18:28,230 --> 02:18:31,210
this is a very unhappy place that
a lot of martial artists are in,

4514
02:18:31,211 --> 02:18:32,044
which is,

4515
02:18:32,590 --> 02:18:32,951
you know,

4516
02:18:32,951 --> 02:18:37,930
they don't actually know what they are
capable of and they're living all the

4517
02:18:37,931 --> 02:18:39,400
time with this,

4518
02:18:39,630 --> 02:18:40,040
this,

4519
02:18:40,040 --> 02:18:40,380
you know,

4520
02:18:40,380 --> 02:18:43,390
just kind of training software
running in their heads and it's,

4521
02:18:43,960 --> 02:18:44,321
it's,

4522
02:18:44,321 --> 02:18:44,920
um,

4523
02:18:44,920 --> 02:18:45,970
it's a weird space to be in.

4524
02:18:46,180 --> 02:18:46,511
Well,

4525
02:18:46,511 --> 02:18:48,790
it's one of the things that's so
great about Brazilian Jujitsu.

4526
02:18:48,970 --> 02:18:49,510
Exactly.

4527
02:18:49,510 --> 02:18:50,470
The Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.

4528
02:18:50,471 --> 02:18:53,230
You mean you're not getting punched
and you're not getting kicked,

4529
02:18:53,231 --> 02:18:57,280
but you are absolutely going full blast
and you have 100 percent confidence when

4530
02:18:57,281 --> 02:19:01,080
she reached a certain level that you could
do that to an untrained person within

4531
02:19:01,090 --> 02:19:01,990
his frame.

4532
02:19:02,450 --> 02:19:03,730
You are pressure testing it,

4533
02:19:03,770 --> 02:19:05,060
you know that it works now.

4534
02:19:05,070 --> 02:19:05,903
You don't know.

4535
02:19:06,340 --> 02:19:11,230
I would argue there people still lose
sight of the fact that in reality people,

4536
02:19:11,440 --> 02:19:14,140
people are punching and they're not
training a lot of punching or defense.

4537
02:19:14,141 --> 02:19:17,230
And then there are weapons
and then there's the guy's
friend who can come up and

4538
02:19:17,231 --> 02:19:18,280
start kicking you in your head.

4539
02:19:18,320 --> 02:19:19,100
Just so you know,

4540
02:19:19,100 --> 02:19:19,410
like,

4541
02:19:19,410 --> 02:19:22,570
like how good an idea was it to pull
guard when you know someone else can walk

4542
02:19:22,571 --> 02:19:23,300
up.

4543
02:19:23,300 --> 02:19:23,710
Uh,

4544
02:19:23,710 --> 02:19:25,390
but you know.

4545
02:19:25,840 --> 02:19:26,111
Yeah.

4546
02:19:26,111 --> 02:19:26,711
It's within,

4547
02:19:26,711 --> 02:19:28,670
it's within its purview.

4548
02:19:28,671 --> 02:19:28,971
Yeah.

4549
02:19:28,971 --> 02:19:29,510
You're not the,

4550
02:19:29,510 --> 02:19:29,671
you're,

4551
02:19:29,671 --> 02:19:32,240
you're working out all of
your illusions and that's,

4552
02:19:32,380 --> 02:19:32,710
that's,

4553
02:19:32,710 --> 02:19:35,690
that's one reason why so
many of us find it addictive.

4554
02:19:35,850 --> 02:19:36,100
Sure.

4555
02:19:36,100 --> 02:19:36,461
Yeah.

4556
02:19:36,461 --> 02:19:36,941
There's that.

4557
02:19:36,941 --> 02:19:41,620
And there's also the so nice Jujitsu
people are so friendly and I think that's

4558
02:19:41,621 --> 02:19:42,880
one of the reasons why
they're so friendly.

4559
02:19:42,881 --> 02:19:45,880
They're not carrying around
all that bullshit that a
lot of people carry around,

4560
02:19:45,881 --> 02:19:46,600
including,

4561
02:19:46,600 --> 02:19:47,433
you know,

4562
02:19:47,440 --> 02:19:50,380
there's some grown men that have never
been in a fight in their life and they

4563
02:19:50,381 --> 02:19:53,320
get a couple of beers in them and
they start talking crazy shit came in.

4564
02:19:53,321 --> 02:19:54,430
You don't even know how to fight.

4565
02:19:54,910 --> 02:19:55,180
You don't.

4566
02:19:55,180 --> 02:19:56,260
What do you see?

4567
02:19:56,590 --> 02:19:58,930
Someone who wants to
jump into a nascar race.

4568
02:19:58,931 --> 02:19:59,950
He never driven a car,

4569
02:20:00,220 --> 02:20:03,220
like stop talking to some
guy with cauliflower ear.

4570
02:20:03,450 --> 02:20:04,211
Even know what that means.

4571
02:20:04,211 --> 02:20:05,044
Right?

4572
02:20:05,380 --> 02:20:06,213
Yeah.

4573
02:20:06,220 --> 02:20:06,581
It's,

4574
02:20:06,581 --> 02:20:07,180
I mean,

4575
02:20:07,180 --> 02:20:09,910
to be a human being is complicated,

4576
02:20:09,911 --> 02:20:14,770
to be a man and in the face of
altercations with other men is uniquely

4577
02:20:14,771 --> 02:20:15,604
complicated.

4578
02:20:15,890 --> 02:20:16,260
You know,

4579
02:20:16,260 --> 02:20:20,830
the kind of altercations that men get
into the kind of bravado and chest puffing

4580
02:20:20,831 --> 02:20:23,560
and shit talking and the
consequences of those things.

4581
02:20:23,561 --> 02:20:25,540
Like you were talking about Liam Neeson,

4582
02:20:25,960 --> 02:20:27,760
his wife falling down
and hitting her head.

4583
02:20:28,090 --> 02:20:33,090
A friend of mine was working in a bar and
in Long Island and one of the bouncers

4584
02:20:33,191 --> 02:20:35,020
got in a fight with some
guy and punched the guy,

4585
02:20:35,021 --> 02:20:35,681
knocked him out.

4586
02:20:35,681 --> 02:20:36,514
The guy fell back,

4587
02:20:36,550 --> 02:20:38,080
hit his head off the curb and died,

4588
02:20:38,590 --> 02:20:40,100
and that happens all the time.

4589
02:20:40,150 --> 02:20:41,320
When people get knocked out,

4590
02:20:41,321 --> 02:20:42,190
they hit their head on the ground.

4591
02:20:42,191 --> 02:20:42,890
They die.

4592
02:20:42,890 --> 02:20:43,723
Yeah,

4593
02:20:43,820 --> 02:20:44,040
yeah.

4594
02:20:44,040 --> 02:20:44,401
I actually,

4595
02:20:44,401 --> 02:20:44,950
I did when I,

4596
02:20:44,950 --> 02:20:46,220
before I had a podcast,

4597
02:20:46,320 --> 02:20:48,600
I was getting my midlife crisis,

4598
02:20:48,601 --> 02:20:53,601
took the form of beginning really back
into martial arts again for after a

4599
02:20:53,700 --> 02:20:55,290
hiatus of maybe 25 years.

4600
02:20:56,280 --> 02:20:57,090
I had a,

4601
02:20:57,090 --> 02:20:58,370
a lawyer who,

4602
02:20:58,400 --> 02:21:01,980
who focused on kind of self defense law.

4603
02:21:02,130 --> 02:21:02,281
I mean,

4604
02:21:02,281 --> 02:21:05,940
he was constantly dealing with cases
where someone is either either claiming

4605
02:21:05,941 --> 02:21:08,490
self defense or legit self defense claim,

4606
02:21:09,150 --> 02:21:10,230
but they're basically screwed.

4607
02:21:10,231 --> 02:21:10,500
I mean they,

4608
02:21:10,500 --> 02:21:14,260
like they punch someone and that person
fell down on the hit a fire hydrant and

4609
02:21:14,261 --> 02:21:14,641
died,

4610
02:21:14,641 --> 02:21:15,100
right?

4611
02:21:15,100 --> 02:21:15,933
So they're,

4612
02:21:16,140 --> 02:21:17,520
they're trying to beat a murder rap,

4613
02:21:17,610 --> 02:21:18,443
you know?

4614
02:21:18,510 --> 02:21:21,120
And so I just had him in a blog post,

4615
02:21:21,121 --> 02:21:24,180
had him walk me and I had a bunch of.

4616
02:21:24,240 --> 02:21:25,710
I had two people comment,

4617
02:21:26,490 --> 02:21:27,630
ask questions as well.

4618
02:21:27,631 --> 02:21:28,464
I had um,

4619
02:21:28,530 --> 02:21:29,363
Matt Thornton,

4620
02:21:30,530 --> 02:21:31,363
who's um,

4621
02:21:32,180 --> 02:21:32,460
uh,

4622
02:21:32,460 --> 02:21:33,540
John Cavanaugh's,

4623
02:21:33,870 --> 02:21:34,950
Jujitsu coach.

4624
02:21:35,400 --> 02:21:40,400
I'm a ask questions in this blog post and
I had rory Miller who's a self defense

4625
02:21:41,911 --> 02:21:45,360
trainer and just just to try to flesh
out all of the things you should be

4626
02:21:45,361 --> 02:21:48,990
thinking about when you're
the kind of person who

4627
02:21:51,030 --> 02:21:56,030
use at all preparing for the possible
eventuality of violence because people who

4628
02:21:56,731 --> 02:22:01,731
trained with guns or own own guns or
carry knives or do martial arts don't

4629
02:22:02,490 --> 02:22:06,990
actually understand what happens when,

4630
02:22:07,470 --> 02:22:08,303
you know,

4631
02:22:08,400 --> 02:22:09,320
like they,

4632
02:22:09,330 --> 02:22:11,880
they agreed to fight
somebody or they like,

4633
02:22:11,890 --> 02:22:12,060
like,

4634
02:22:12,060 --> 02:22:12,370
like,

4635
02:22:12,370 --> 02:22:13,310
like in,

4636
02:22:13,320 --> 02:22:13,801
unless you,

4637
02:22:13,801 --> 02:22:15,120
unless you're emo is,

4638
02:22:15,121 --> 02:22:18,480
and this should be your emo
to avoid violence at all.

4639
02:22:18,540 --> 02:22:19,800
Virtually any cost,

4640
02:22:19,801 --> 02:22:19,981
right?

4641
02:22:19,981 --> 02:22:22,620
Like you're always just
trying to leave the premises.

4642
02:22:22,650 --> 02:22:24,990
If there's some sort of
challenge that could become,

4643
02:22:25,860 --> 02:22:26,700
if that's not your,

4644
02:22:26,760 --> 02:22:27,600
your emo,

4645
02:22:28,320 --> 02:22:32,790
you're just wandering into potential
situations where you can find yourself in

4646
02:22:32,791 --> 02:22:35,010
court for having shoved a guy and he,

4647
02:22:35,011 --> 02:22:35,400
you know,

4648
02:22:35,400 --> 02:22:37,020
fell into the street and got run over,

4649
02:22:37,050 --> 02:22:37,311
right?

4650
02:22:37,311 --> 02:22:37,530
You're like.

4651
02:22:37,530 --> 02:22:41,610
And then now you're the guy who's looking
at the prospect of going to prison

4652
02:22:41,730 --> 02:22:42,130
for,

4653
02:22:42,130 --> 02:22:42,650
you know,

4654
02:22:42,650 --> 02:22:44,790
for a murder or,

4655
02:22:44,820 --> 02:22:45,270
or,

4656
02:22:45,270 --> 02:22:45,930
or,

4657
02:22:45,930 --> 02:22:46,763
um,

4658
02:22:47,160 --> 02:22:47,341
you know,

4659
02:22:47,341 --> 02:22:48,270
second degree murder.

4660
02:22:48,870 --> 02:22:50,400
And so anyway,

4661
02:22:50,401 --> 02:22:53,040
I had him walk me through all of
the INS and outs of all of that.

4662
02:22:53,080 --> 02:22:54,900
It was a fascinating
conversation because yeah,

4663
02:22:54,901 --> 02:22:56,040
there are people who,

4664
02:22:56,940 --> 02:22:57,750
you know,

4665
02:22:57,750 --> 02:22:58,740
I mean there are extreme cases,

4666
02:22:58,770 --> 02:23:00,480
there are women who have shot,

4667
02:23:00,560 --> 02:23:05,100
they're totally crazy husband who's like
waving a baseball bat at their heads

4668
02:23:05,700 --> 02:23:09,120
and they're in prison for years for this,

4669
02:23:09,150 --> 02:23:09,740
you know,

4670
02:23:09,740 --> 02:23:13,350
just real miscarriages of justice where
like the like you would think that the,

4671
02:23:14,090 --> 02:23:14,280
the,

4672
02:23:14,280 --> 02:23:14,610
the,

4673
02:23:14,610 --> 02:23:15,443
you know,

4674
02:23:15,550 --> 02:23:16,030
the,

4675
02:23:16,030 --> 02:23:19,470
it would be very easy to prove that she
was in fear for her life in this case.

4676
02:23:19,470 --> 02:23:22,830
And this was a legitimate
use of lethal force.

4677
02:23:23,100 --> 02:23:24,750
It's just so hard with no one's there.

4678
02:23:24,880 --> 02:23:25,200
Yeah.

4679
02:23:25,200 --> 02:23:25,791
If no one's there.

4680
02:23:25,791 --> 02:23:29,550
I mean if you have eyewitnesses or if
it's a public thing that happens and

4681
02:23:29,551 --> 02:23:30,540
there's video of it,

4682
02:23:31,170 --> 02:23:32,160
but you know,

4683
02:23:32,820 --> 02:23:36,090
someone does something to someone and no
one's around and you punch someone and

4684
02:23:36,100 --> 02:23:37,920
they get knocked out and they die.

4685
02:23:38,130 --> 02:23:38,491
And he said,

4686
02:23:38,491 --> 02:23:38,641
no,

4687
02:23:38,641 --> 02:23:40,620
this guy was threatening to kill me.

4688
02:23:40,860 --> 02:23:42,030
He was chasing me.

4689
02:23:42,031 --> 02:23:43,260
He was threatening to kill me.

4690
02:23:43,261 --> 02:23:44,730
I was terrified for my life.

4691
02:23:44,820 --> 02:23:46,020
He lunged towards me.

4692
02:23:46,021 --> 02:23:46,950
I saw the opening,

4693
02:23:46,951 --> 02:23:47,491
I took it,

4694
02:23:47,491 --> 02:23:48,324
and now he's dead.

4695
02:23:48,680 --> 02:23:49,740
You can go to jail forever.

4696
02:23:50,130 --> 02:23:51,000
I mean that's that.

4697
02:23:51,020 --> 02:23:51,930
That's a reality.

4698
02:23:51,931 --> 02:23:52,230
I mean,

4699
02:23:52,230 --> 02:23:55,920
you should absolutely without a
doubt avoid violence at all costs,

4700
02:23:56,550 --> 02:23:57,900
but you should also know how to fight.

4701
02:23:58,320 --> 02:24:00,450
I definitely think that's very important.

4702
02:24:00,480 --> 02:24:01,440
It's very important,

4703
02:24:02,780 --> 02:24:04,130
but very few people trained.

4704
02:24:04,170 --> 02:24:06,240
So it's like in the curriculum of,

4705
02:24:06,480 --> 02:24:08,640
of learning how to fight training in,

4706
02:24:08,730 --> 02:24:11,760
in whatever martial art or arts.

4707
02:24:12,580 --> 02:24:14,040
There's in most cases,

4708
02:24:14,041 --> 02:24:18,030
very little time spent training avoidance.

4709
02:24:18,120 --> 02:24:18,600
Yes.

4710
02:24:18,600 --> 02:24:18,871
Right.

4711
02:24:18,871 --> 02:24:19,704
And that's,

4712
02:24:19,930 --> 02:24:20,340
that's,

4713
02:24:20,340 --> 02:24:24,090
that's a real missing piece because that
is the most important thing to train.

4714
02:24:24,120 --> 02:24:24,960
I mean it's like,

4715
02:24:25,040 --> 02:24:26,520
you know,

4716
02:24:26,521 --> 02:24:28,710
especially if you have real skills,

4717
02:24:28,711 --> 02:24:28,981
right?

4718
02:24:28,981 --> 02:24:30,750
Especially if you're walking around armed,

4719
02:24:30,810 --> 02:24:31,051
right?

4720
02:24:31,051 --> 02:24:31,291
I mean that,

4721
02:24:31,291 --> 02:24:31,960
that was the one,

4722
02:24:31,960 --> 02:24:36,930
the one in interesting psychological
corrective that concealed carry does for

4723
02:24:36,931 --> 02:24:41,040
many people is that once you're
squawking around with a gun,

4724
02:24:41,520 --> 02:24:45,540
you realize what the problem of,

4725
02:24:45,600 --> 02:24:46,411
of what,

4726
02:24:46,411 --> 02:24:48,420
what any altercation can become.

4727
02:24:48,580 --> 02:24:49,060
Like A,

4728
02:24:49,060 --> 02:24:52,350
you're not going to get into a shoving
match with somebody if you're wearing a

4729
02:24:52,351 --> 02:24:54,970
gun in your belt because you like it.

4730
02:24:55,010 --> 02:24:56,190
If that escalates,

4731
02:24:56,250 --> 02:24:59,340
you're pulling out your gun and then as
a decision of whether to kill somebody

4732
02:24:59,420 --> 02:25:00,090
know,

4733
02:25:00,090 --> 02:25:01,140
so you know,

4734
02:25:01,220 --> 02:25:02,180
and you know,

4735
02:25:02,220 --> 02:25:04,950
I don't have a ton of
experience in this area,

4736
02:25:04,951 --> 02:25:05,490
but you know,

4737
02:25:05,490 --> 02:25:08,190
for all the firearm training
I've done with people,

4738
02:25:08,670 --> 02:25:09,503
um,

4739
02:25:09,930 --> 02:25:10,411
I just get,

4740
02:25:10,411 --> 02:25:11,180
you know,

4741
02:25:11,180 --> 02:25:11,370
you know,

4742
02:25:11,370 --> 02:25:11,541
I,

4743
02:25:11,541 --> 02:25:16,541
I know like former swat operators who
are just out there constantly armed and

4744
02:25:20,940 --> 02:25:23,770
these are like the last guys who are
going to get involved in anything.

4745
02:25:23,800 --> 02:25:25,030
I mean they used to be cops,

4746
02:25:25,031 --> 02:25:28,160
but now they don't even feel
any burden to police any.

4747
02:25:28,220 --> 02:25:29,290
Like it's like they're just,

4748
02:25:29,860 --> 02:25:30,641
they're retired,

4749
02:25:30,641 --> 02:25:31,780
emphatically retired,

4750
02:25:31,810 --> 02:25:32,610
right?

4751
02:25:32,610 --> 02:25:33,160
Um,

4752
02:25:33,160 --> 02:25:37,210
because they just recognize how
haywire anything can go for them.

4753
02:25:37,211 --> 02:25:37,510
If,

4754
02:25:37,510 --> 02:25:37,930
if,

4755
02:25:37,930 --> 02:25:38,330
uh,

4756
02:25:38,330 --> 02:25:38,650
you know,

4757
02:25:38,650 --> 02:25:39,130
any,

4758
02:25:39,130 --> 02:25:40,810
any process of conflict gets started.

4759
02:25:40,870 --> 02:25:41,261
And again,

4760
02:25:41,261 --> 02:25:44,380
I think this goes back to
understanding how to manage your mind.

4761
02:25:44,500 --> 02:25:44,831
You know,

4762
02:25:44,831 --> 02:25:47,800
when the shit hits the
fan and things go crazy,

4763
02:25:47,830 --> 02:25:48,090
it's,

4764
02:25:48,090 --> 02:25:53,090
it's very difficult for people to maintain
a rational state of mind and things

4765
02:25:54,011 --> 02:25:56,050
can escalate so quickly.

4766
02:25:56,440 --> 02:25:58,600
Things can turn to violence so quickly,

4767
02:25:58,601 --> 02:26:02,200
especially with irrational people or
untrained people or people that aren't

4768
02:26:02,201 --> 02:26:07,201
aware of consequences or maybe can't
process it well by and the crucial piece

4769
02:26:07,481 --> 02:26:08,314
which you know,

4770
02:26:08,320 --> 02:26:09,153
many

4771
02:26:10,840 --> 02:26:13,570
seasoned fighters and,

4772
02:26:13,660 --> 02:26:14,140
and you know,

4773
02:26:14,140 --> 02:26:19,140
professionals don't have area I would
think many don't have is this sort of

4774
02:26:20,260 --> 02:26:20,561
this,

4775
02:26:20,561 --> 02:26:25,090
this valley where your ego
concerns are not worked out.

4776
02:26:25,150 --> 02:26:25,960
It's like when you,

4777
02:26:25,960 --> 02:26:26,620
when you,

4778
02:26:26,620 --> 02:26:30,820
when you feel the emotional
burden of a loss of face,

4779
02:26:30,910 --> 02:26:31,121
right?

4780
02:26:31,121 --> 02:26:36,121
So like if Jocko willink is in a bar and
someone says something nasty to him or

4781
02:26:36,670 --> 02:26:37,503
to his wife,

4782
02:26:38,650 --> 02:26:40,870
Jocko doesn't have anything to prove.

4783
02:26:41,020 --> 02:26:42,670
Like Jocko knows he's a bad ass,

4784
02:26:42,760 --> 02:26:43,001
right?

4785
02:26:43,001 --> 02:26:44,590
So jocko knows that he just,

4786
02:26:44,950 --> 02:26:47,920
it's time to get out of the bar because
he doesn't want to deal with the

4787
02:26:47,921 --> 02:26:49,870
psychopath who doesn't
know who he's dealing with.

4788
02:26:50,620 --> 02:26:53,890
A by someone who's not trained like Jocko.

4789
02:26:53,980 --> 02:26:54,813
Right?

4790
02:26:55,480 --> 02:26:57,400
Could feel that backing down,

4791
02:26:57,401 --> 02:27:00,220
especially back in down in front
of your wife or your girlfriend.

4792
02:27:00,580 --> 02:27:05,020
That is such an ego blow that
the temptation to get into this,

4793
02:27:05,050 --> 02:27:07,090
this monkey dance with
the other person is just,

4794
02:27:07,300 --> 02:27:09,090
is a.

4795
02:27:09,900 --> 02:27:12,910
it's impossible to recover
from the very dangerous game.

4796
02:27:13,060 --> 02:27:13,480
Yeah.

4797
02:27:13,480 --> 02:27:13,661
Yeah.

4798
02:27:13,661 --> 02:27:16,630
And people get into it all the time and
I've seen so many people get into it

4799
02:27:16,631 --> 02:27:17,290
that just don't.

4800
02:27:17,290 --> 02:27:18,190
They don't have any cards.

4801
02:27:18,910 --> 02:27:21,160
Literally bluffing a God damn it,

4802
02:27:21,161 --> 02:27:21,520
man,

4803
02:27:21,520 --> 02:27:22,600
to stop doing this.

4804
02:27:22,930 --> 02:27:23,560
You know,

4805
02:27:23,560 --> 02:27:24,190
look,

4806
02:27:24,190 --> 02:27:27,210
I've been doing martial arts my whole
life and I'm terrified of fights.

4807
02:27:27,540 --> 02:27:27,881
I see.

4808
02:27:27,881 --> 02:27:28,511
Fides is like,

4809
02:27:28,511 --> 02:27:32,500
get the fuck out of here before
this goes bad when it goes sideways,

4810
02:27:32,950 --> 02:27:33,310
you know,

4811
02:27:33,310 --> 02:27:34,143
men are just,

4812
02:27:35,110 --> 02:27:37,960
we have thousands of years of awful DNA,

4813
02:27:38,340 --> 02:27:38,950
you know,

4814
02:27:38,950 --> 02:27:39,783
we really do.

4815
02:27:39,990 --> 02:27:41,140
We were violent.

4816
02:27:41,141 --> 02:27:42,070
Hundreds of thousands.

4817
02:27:42,480 --> 02:27:43,360
Millions.

4818
02:27:44,140 --> 02:27:45,280
Violence was imperative.

4819
02:27:45,310 --> 02:27:46,780
It was imperative for survival.

4820
02:27:46,810 --> 02:27:47,570
You had,

4821
02:27:47,570 --> 02:27:51,040
he had to be able to react and react
quickly and yet you had to know what to do

4822
02:27:51,041 --> 02:27:52,050
with your genes are never gonna.

4823
02:27:52,070 --> 02:27:53,050
Make it to the next stage,

4824
02:27:54,100 --> 02:27:54,933
which is,

4825
02:27:55,080 --> 02:27:56,860
this is a controversial thing to say.

4826
02:27:56,861 --> 02:27:58,000
And I got in trouble,

4827
02:27:58,001 --> 02:27:59,770
or one of my podcast guests,

4828
02:27:59,800 --> 02:28:00,670
Gavin de Becker,

4829
02:28:00,730 --> 02:28:00,840
uh,

4830
02:28:00,840 --> 02:28:01,673
the security,

4831
02:28:02,080 --> 02:28:07,080
a guru got in trouble in my podcast
talking about the primacy of,

4832
02:28:08,170 --> 02:28:09,220
of intuition here.

4833
02:28:09,290 --> 02:28:10,123
Like,

4834
02:28:10,180 --> 02:28:15,180
our intuitions are actually really good
for detecting something that makes us

4835
02:28:16,541 --> 02:28:18,100
uncomfortable about another person.

4836
02:28:18,220 --> 02:28:18,521
Right?

4837
02:28:18,521 --> 02:28:19,354
And this is,

4838
02:28:19,570 --> 02:28:22,370
this becomes politically
incorrect really fast,

4839
02:28:22,371 --> 02:28:22,581
right?

4840
02:28:22,581 --> 02:28:23,480
Because it's like,

4841
02:28:23,481 --> 02:28:23,661
you know,

4842
02:28:23,661 --> 02:28:27,800
if you see a guy on an elevator
who makes you uncomfortable,

4843
02:28:28,280 --> 02:28:28,520
you know,

4844
02:28:28,520 --> 02:28:29,570
Gavin's advice,

4845
02:28:29,571 --> 02:28:30,090
and I think,

4846
02:28:30,090 --> 02:28:32,840
I think the real sane
advice is just don't get on,

4847
02:28:32,870 --> 02:28:36,680
but there are many people who get on just
because they want to prove they're not

4848
02:28:36,681 --> 02:28:37,251
racist,

4849
02:28:37,251 --> 02:28:37,521
right?

4850
02:28:37,521 --> 02:28:37,990
Or they're not.

4851
02:28:37,990 --> 02:28:38,410
It's psych.

4852
02:28:38,410 --> 02:28:38,630
And,

4853
02:28:38,630 --> 02:28:39,870
and uh,

4854
02:28:39,880 --> 02:28:44,150
I actually know someone who was in a
situation like that and it didn't work out

4855
02:28:44,151 --> 02:28:44,450
well.

4856
02:28:44,450 --> 02:28:49,130
And so intuition is
bad for so many things.

4857
02:28:49,131 --> 02:28:53,180
We have terrible intuitions for
statistics and probability theory,

4858
02:28:53,181 --> 02:28:54,620
and it's like word over reliant.

4859
02:28:54,670 --> 02:28:55,390
We,

4860
02:28:55,390 --> 02:28:56,000
you know,

4861
02:28:56,000 --> 02:28:59,120
whole careers and Nobel
prizes have been won on,

4862
02:28:59,480 --> 02:29:00,020
you know,

4863
02:29:00,020 --> 02:29:05,020
people like Danny Conoman
have have shown us how.

4864
02:29:05,510 --> 02:29:08,120
It's not only that our
intuitions are bad for,

4865
02:29:08,150 --> 02:29:09,200
for these judgments,

4866
02:29:09,530 --> 02:29:10,700
but the reliably bad,

4867
02:29:10,701 --> 02:29:11,820
and we can understand there's this,

4868
02:29:11,850 --> 02:29:13,760
there's a structure to how bad they are.

4869
02:29:14,300 --> 02:29:19,300
But for judging people who are dangerous,

4870
02:29:20,070 --> 02:29:20,690
who gives us the,

4871
02:29:20,690 --> 02:29:21,170
who makes,

4872
02:29:21,170 --> 02:29:25,160
who makes the hair stand up on the
back of our neck for reasons we can't

4873
02:29:25,370 --> 02:29:26,203
understand,

4874
02:29:26,680 --> 02:29:27,120
um,

4875
02:29:27,120 --> 02:29:27,420
you know,

4876
02:29:27,420 --> 02:29:29,410
for where the eye contact
was wrong or though,

4877
02:29:29,460 --> 02:29:32,410
or just the way they were just like a,

4878
02:29:32,870 --> 02:29:33,980
what's called a witness check,

4879
02:29:33,981 --> 02:29:34,191
you know,

4880
02:29:34,191 --> 02:29:38,810
like someone comes up to you and
engages you and then they look to,

4881
02:29:39,130 --> 02:29:41,750
they just kind of look to
check for witnesses right now.

4882
02:29:41,751 --> 02:29:42,830
Like people don't,

4883
02:29:43,010 --> 02:29:45,980
aren't aware that that's even a thing,

4884
02:29:46,370 --> 02:29:47,203
right?

4885
02:29:47,240 --> 02:29:52,240
But when like that body
language is very salient to us.

4886
02:29:52,400 --> 02:29:53,000
And,

4887
02:29:53,000 --> 02:29:53,820
and uh,

4888
02:29:53,820 --> 02:29:54,090
there,

4889
02:29:54,090 --> 02:29:55,790
there are hundreds of
things like that that,

4890
02:29:56,510 --> 02:29:56,901
that,

4891
02:29:56,901 --> 02:29:57,734
um,

4892
02:29:58,280 --> 02:30:00,920
we immediately feel that prompt,

4893
02:30:01,030 --> 02:30:01,370
you know,

4894
02:30:01,370 --> 02:30:02,630
an intuitive response.

4895
02:30:02,630 --> 02:30:05,840
And these are intuitions that are from
a self defense point of view are worth

4896
02:30:05,841 --> 02:30:09,200
listening to because it's like the worst
case scenario is you wind up being a

4897
02:30:09,201 --> 02:30:09,740
little rude.

4898
02:30:09,740 --> 02:30:10,680
They're like,

4899
02:30:10,730 --> 02:30:11,021
sorry,

4900
02:30:11,021 --> 02:30:11,220
I'm not,

4901
02:30:11,220 --> 02:30:11,400
you know,

4902
02:30:11,400 --> 02:30:12,233
I can't talk,

4903
02:30:12,710 --> 02:30:14,900
but I'm a.

4904
02:30:15,620 --> 02:30:16,220
people are,

4905
02:30:16,220 --> 02:30:16,700
you know,

4906
02:30:16,700 --> 02:30:21,700
people are very dogmatically being
kind of trained to ignore those,

4907
02:30:22,850 --> 02:30:23,900
those kinds of intuitions.

4908
02:30:23,901 --> 02:30:25,430
And what do you think
those intuitions are like?

4909
02:30:25,431 --> 02:30:26,600
What do you think intuitions are?

4910
02:30:26,690 --> 02:30:27,620
But when you meet someone,

4911
02:30:27,621 --> 02:30:28,040
you go,

4912
02:30:28,040 --> 02:30:28,241
Whoa,

4913
02:30:28,241 --> 02:30:29,630
this person feels dangerous.

4914
02:30:29,720 --> 02:30:29,901
Like,

4915
02:30:29,901 --> 02:30:30,734
what is that?

4916
02:30:30,770 --> 02:30:31,603
What's happening?

4917
02:30:31,850 --> 02:30:32,031
Well,

4918
02:30:32,031 --> 02:30:33,040
there's a lot of it,

4919
02:30:33,460 --> 02:30:33,980
you know,

4920
02:30:33,980 --> 02:30:36,260
gays detection is a big one.

4921
02:30:36,261 --> 02:30:36,411
I mean,

4922
02:30:36,411 --> 02:30:38,150
we know what people do
with their eyes is a,

4923
02:30:38,151 --> 02:30:38,720
is a,

4924
02:30:38,720 --> 02:30:41,360
is a major variable in
just how we feel that,

4925
02:30:41,990 --> 02:30:42,500
you know,

4926
02:30:42,500 --> 02:30:42,741
the,

4927
02:30:42,741 --> 02:30:44,060
the relationship is going.

4928
02:30:44,730 --> 02:30:45,563
Um,

4929
02:30:45,650 --> 02:30:48,020
but it's a.

4930
02:30:49,520 --> 02:30:53,720
and there's their micro expressions that
we notice in people that were not aware

4931
02:30:53,721 --> 02:30:54,321
of noticing,

4932
02:30:54,321 --> 02:30:54,550
you know,

4933
02:30:54,550 --> 02:30:55,251
but like there's just,

4934
02:30:55,251 --> 02:30:55,670
there's,

4935
02:30:55,670 --> 02:30:56,370
this is,

4936
02:30:56,370 --> 02:30:57,860
this is not well understood.

4937
02:30:58,470 --> 02:30:59,303
Uh,

4938
02:30:59,600 --> 02:31:03,050
and we're bad judges of whether
someone is telling the truth.

4939
02:31:03,051 --> 02:31:03,201
I mean,

4940
02:31:03,201 --> 02:31:03,470
this,

4941
02:31:03,470 --> 02:31:04,880
this has been fairly well studied.

4942
02:31:04,881 --> 02:31:05,840
I mean there are people who,

4943
02:31:06,330 --> 02:31:08,840
even people who work for the FBI or not,

4944
02:31:08,960 --> 02:31:09,290
you know,

4945
02:31:09,290 --> 02:31:12,140
much better than chance and
detecting whether somebody is lying.

4946
02:31:12,740 --> 02:31:14,060
But that's just,

4947
02:31:14,061 --> 02:31:17,330
we get so much information by,

4948
02:31:17,570 --> 02:31:17,920
you know,

4949
02:31:17,920 --> 02:31:22,920
body language and being somebody's
presence and we get it so fast that it's,

4950
02:31:24,151 --> 02:31:24,540
um,

4951
02:31:24,540 --> 02:31:25,130
again,

4952
02:31:25,130 --> 02:31:26,210
I mean there,

4953
02:31:27,390 --> 02:31:28,770
whether we understand it or not,

4954
02:31:29,030 --> 02:31:31,200
they're evolutionary
reasons why this is so.

4955
02:31:31,201 --> 02:31:31,411
I mean,

4956
02:31:31,411 --> 02:31:31,520
if,

4957
02:31:31,520 --> 02:31:35,040
if we've evolved for
anything as social primates,

4958
02:31:35,490 --> 02:31:40,490
we have evolved to detect stuff that
just is a precursor to violent intent in,

4959
02:31:42,620 --> 02:31:43,340
in others.

4960
02:31:43,340 --> 02:31:46,890
Do you think it's just gaze or do you
think you can send the energy of someone?

4961
02:31:48,120 --> 02:31:51,210
There's certain movements that people
make when they're thinking about hitting

4962
02:31:51,211 --> 02:31:51,360
him.

4963
02:31:51,360 --> 02:31:51,751
Oh yeah,

4964
02:31:51,751 --> 02:31:52,021
yeah,

4965
02:31:52,021 --> 02:31:52,210
yeah.

4966
02:31:52,210 --> 02:31:54,360
There's certain like there's
like a twitchiness to them.

4967
02:31:54,361 --> 02:31:57,750
I got while pulled back like
almost like a spring or a bow.

4968
02:31:57,960 --> 02:32:00,780
There's like a feeling you get around
people that are looking to hit people.

4969
02:32:00,840 --> 02:32:00,961
Yeah.

4970
02:32:00,961 --> 02:32:02,100
Well there's again,

4971
02:32:02,101 --> 02:32:03,180
all of that still vision,

4972
02:32:03,181 --> 02:32:03,571
but there's,

4973
02:32:03,571 --> 02:32:03,860
you know,

4974
02:32:03,860 --> 02:32:04,210
I mean who,

4975
02:32:04,210 --> 02:32:08,130
who knows where to texting pheromones
where we could be detecting people's level

4976
02:32:08,131 --> 02:32:09,420
of stress.

4977
02:32:09,421 --> 02:32:10,830
I mean just how to end up there.

4978
02:32:12,100 --> 02:32:12,300
But,

4979
02:32:12,300 --> 02:32:13,530
and this goes beyond,

4980
02:32:13,531 --> 02:32:16,230
this is beyond just physical violence.

4981
02:32:16,231 --> 02:32:17,064
This is just,

4982
02:32:17,160 --> 02:32:17,940
you know,

4983
02:32:17,940 --> 02:32:21,330
detecting psychopaths who
are being manipulated.

4984
02:32:21,331 --> 02:32:21,481
I mean,

4985
02:32:21,481 --> 02:32:23,150
just detecting mean there,

4986
02:32:23,180 --> 02:32:25,050
there are ways to spot people line,

4987
02:32:25,990 --> 02:32:26,823
uh,

4988
02:32:26,920 --> 02:32:27,460
you know,

4989
02:32:27,460 --> 02:32:27,950
I mean just,

4990
02:32:27,950 --> 02:32:28,240
you know,

4991
02:32:28,240 --> 02:32:28,630
they're,

4992
02:32:28,630 --> 02:32:31,440
they're tells like too much information,

4993
02:32:31,500 --> 02:32:31,681
you know,

4994
02:32:31,681 --> 02:32:36,150
like people who are giving you
support the superfluous information,

4995
02:32:36,760 --> 02:32:37,480
uh,

4996
02:32:37,480 --> 02:32:37,820
as,

4997
02:32:37,820 --> 02:32:41,070
as an overcorrection because they're
anticipating that you're going to doubt

4998
02:32:41,130 --> 02:32:45,420
their story and so they're filling in
blanks that you don't even need filled in.

4999
02:32:45,480 --> 02:32:45,810
Right.

5000
02:32:45,810 --> 02:32:46,010
And,

5001
02:32:46,010 --> 02:32:47,970
and it's the sort of patterns to,

5002
02:32:48,700 --> 02:32:50,340
to sort of to that.

5003
02:32:50,400 --> 02:32:52,020
But again,

5004
02:32:52,380 --> 02:32:52,660
we,

5005
02:32:52,660 --> 02:32:53,070
we,

5006
02:32:53,070 --> 02:32:57,120
we pick up on a lot of this stuff
without consciously being aware of what's

5007
02:32:57,121 --> 02:32:57,601
going on.

5008
02:32:57,601 --> 02:33:01,020
We just know that that's not a person
I want to spend anymore time with.

5009
02:33:01,050 --> 02:33:01,883
Right?

5010
02:33:01,900 --> 02:33:02,700
Uh,

5011
02:33:02,700 --> 02:33:03,533
but you know,

5012
02:33:03,630 --> 02:33:06,450
there may be more of a literature
on this than I know about,

5013
02:33:06,451 --> 02:33:11,451
but a lot of this is not well understood
and people like Paul Ekman have done a

5014
02:33:12,391 --> 02:33:17,391
lot of stuff on micro micro expressions
that goes back probably 30 years at this

5015
02:33:20,131 --> 02:33:20,964
point.

5016
02:33:21,150 --> 02:33:25,280
And there are people who are outliers
who are great at detecting micro

5017
02:33:25,300 --> 02:33:26,400
expressions where they really,

5018
02:33:27,280 --> 02:33:29,370
they really just
understand what's going on,

5019
02:33:29,371 --> 02:33:30,340
but it's not.

5020
02:33:30,630 --> 02:33:30,880
And,

5021
02:33:30,880 --> 02:33:34,680
and ai eventually will be
if it is not there already,

5022
02:33:34,681 --> 02:33:36,630
we'll be much better
than we are doing this.

5023
02:33:36,660 --> 02:33:39,750
I'm so scared of that service
here that I'm getting that wrong.

5024
02:33:40,590 --> 02:33:43,910
Micro expressions are funny because
they remind me of microaggressions,

5025
02:33:43,920 --> 02:33:44,850
which is one of the,

5026
02:33:45,150 --> 02:33:45,630
you know,

5027
02:33:45,630 --> 02:33:49,260
one of the weirder social justice warrior
things like things that used to be

5028
02:33:49,261 --> 02:33:52,080
just slights where someone
was just like slightly rude.

5029
02:33:52,081 --> 02:33:52,440
Not,

5030
02:33:52,440 --> 02:33:53,520
not even slice,

5031
02:33:53,640 --> 02:33:54,031
just like,

5032
02:33:54,031 --> 02:33:54,860
where do you come from?

5033
02:33:54,860 --> 02:33:55,693
Right.

5034
02:33:56,760 --> 02:33:57,593
Speaking with an accent.

5035
02:33:58,130 --> 02:33:59,020
Where are you from?

5036
02:33:59,050 --> 02:33:59,883
Where are your parents from?

5037
02:34:00,720 --> 02:34:01,553
Dare you?

5038
02:34:01,950 --> 02:34:03,690
How dare you question my authenticity?

5039
02:34:04,230 --> 02:34:04,880
Yeah,

5040
02:34:04,880 --> 02:34:05,830
no aggression.

5041
02:34:06,060 --> 02:34:07,740
It's weird that that's actually accepted,

5042
02:34:07,741 --> 02:34:11,640
that this is something that they're
actually pushing in certain schools that

5043
02:34:11,641 --> 02:34:13,050
microaggressions are a real,

5044
02:34:13,140 --> 02:34:13,973
a real thing.

5045
02:34:14,220 --> 02:34:17,560
I'm Christina Hoff summers
just wrote something about,

5046
02:34:17,670 --> 02:34:18,160
uh,

5047
02:34:18,160 --> 02:34:18,580
or she,

5048
02:34:18,580 --> 02:34:22,150
she put something on her twitter today
about a Yale article that was written

5049
02:34:22,151 --> 02:34:27,151
today that was put out
today about documenting
politically incorrect behavior.

5050
02:34:28,601 --> 02:34:32,650
So that someday in the future when someone
is running for Congress or is up for

5051
02:34:32,651 --> 02:34:36,220
Supreme Court or something that you
could go back to their college days.

5052
02:34:36,220 --> 02:34:40,030
And remember when they said something
and I mean one of the examples is woman

5053
02:34:40,031 --> 02:34:43,990
uses in this post was compared
to a woman to a large animal,

5054
02:34:43,991 --> 02:34:47,890
a woman's body to large animal in a
private text message that she should have.

5055
02:34:48,400 --> 02:34:48,641
Oh,

5056
02:34:48,641 --> 02:34:49,474
I should have.

5057
02:34:50,350 --> 02:34:53,930
I should've and calls this guy in this,

5058
02:34:53,990 --> 02:34:56,050
this article white boy,

5059
02:34:56,350 --> 02:34:57,760
this white boy does this.

5060
02:34:57,761 --> 02:35:00,250
And the white boy with a
saccharin smile does that.

5061
02:35:00,251 --> 02:35:00,730
It's like,

5062
02:35:00,730 --> 02:35:02,470
which is like overtly racist.

5063
02:35:02,830 --> 02:35:07,510
Like they'll just the expression like
in the way she's describing it like a

5064
02:35:07,660 --> 02:35:07,910
disease,

5065
02:35:07,910 --> 02:35:12,790
if this evil character slowly makes
his way to run the world and he's been

5066
02:35:12,880 --> 02:35:15,100
engineered since the
time he was in college.

5067
02:35:16,220 --> 02:35:18,460
Well that's going to happen just by,

5068
02:35:21,370 --> 02:35:24,190
just based on just based on
everyone's use of the tools.

5069
02:35:24,460 --> 02:35:25,150
Like you know,

5070
02:35:25,150 --> 02:35:28,720
people are not diligently scrubbing their,

5071
02:35:28,970 --> 02:35:33,970
their digital history and there may
in fact be no way to actually do it.

5072
02:35:34,320 --> 02:35:34,641
Right.

5073
02:35:34,641 --> 02:35:35,710
And so they're just,

5074
02:35:35,711 --> 02:35:36,550
they're trailing the,

5075
02:35:37,270 --> 02:35:39,700
they're not even aware of what
they're trailing in social media,

5076
02:35:39,701 --> 02:35:40,534
so,

5077
02:35:40,660 --> 02:35:43,150
so I mean maybe maybe that is,

5078
02:35:43,630 --> 02:35:48,310
that will just be a cure for the problem
because at a certain point we'll be

5079
02:35:48,311 --> 02:35:51,070
dealing with people who
were basically born.

5080
02:35:51,100 --> 02:35:52,450
They were born on facebook,

5081
02:35:52,610 --> 02:35:52,920
right?

5082
02:35:52,920 --> 02:35:54,460
Like they don't even have a moment.

5083
02:35:54,520 --> 02:35:58,090
Like they've got their baby picture
there and everything that followed and

5084
02:36:00,610 --> 02:36:02,800
then it'll just seem completely untenable.

5085
02:36:03,070 --> 02:36:04,720
Like choose people who've everything.

5086
02:36:04,721 --> 02:36:04,930
Yeah.

5087
02:36:04,930 --> 02:36:05,770
Just everyone's guilty.

5088
02:36:05,771 --> 02:36:10,771
Everyone has said that dumb thing
matter of taken the worst possible way.

5089
02:36:11,440 --> 02:36:15,460
And if they're going to be
hung from that then you know,

5090
02:36:15,540 --> 02:36:15,820
no,

5091
02:36:15,820 --> 02:36:16,810
no one will survive.

5092
02:36:16,990 --> 02:36:20,110
Well it seems like that's what we're
dealing with right now in a lot of cases.

5093
02:36:20,140 --> 02:36:20,973
You know,

5094
02:36:21,820 --> 02:36:22,653
the,

5095
02:36:23,350 --> 02:36:26,620
what I think is really important that
what you were saying earlier was that

5096
02:36:26,621 --> 02:36:30,860
there has to be some sort of path
to redeeming themselves that there,

5097
02:36:30,861 --> 02:36:35,080
there has to be some accepted way that
someone can go about redeeming themselves

5098
02:36:35,081 --> 02:36:39,580
and we can allow them to reenter society
without constantly bringing it up or

5099
02:36:39,581 --> 02:36:40,570
judging them by it.

5100
02:36:40,570 --> 02:36:45,490
Or always a attributing their past
behavior to who they are right now.

5101
02:36:45,930 --> 02:36:46,240
I mean,

5102
02:36:46,240 --> 02:36:47,073
look at,

5103
02:36:47,410 --> 02:36:48,480
they should be so simple.

5104
02:36:48,490 --> 02:36:50,530
But look at my collaboration
with Majid Nawaz,

5105
02:36:50,590 --> 02:36:50,831
right?

5106
02:36:50,831 --> 02:36:53,860
So like we were on this podcast together.

5107
02:36:54,250 --> 02:36:58,510
Majid was scheming to
form a global caliphate.

5108
02:36:58,511 --> 02:36:58,741
I mean the,

5109
02:36:58,741 --> 02:36:58,951
the,

5110
02:36:58,951 --> 02:36:59,980
the organization,

5111
02:36:59,981 --> 02:37:00,611
he was part of him.

5112
02:37:00,611 --> 02:37:02,300
He wasn't a jihadist thankfully,

5113
02:37:02,301 --> 02:37:04,150
and he wasn't actually blowing people up,

5114
02:37:04,690 --> 02:37:08,520
but he was trying to
get nuclear weapons in,

5115
02:37:08,530 --> 02:37:13,270
in Pakistan into the hands of the
worst possible theocrats right?

5116
02:37:13,720 --> 02:37:14,553
This was his,

5117
02:37:15,470 --> 02:37:18,020
with all of his charisma
and all of his energy.

5118
02:37:18,021 --> 02:37:19,260
And it's like a mantra.

5119
02:37:19,320 --> 02:37:20,270
It is fantastic.

5120
02:37:21,140 --> 02:37:25,610
And he used to eight utterly
nefarious purpose in my world,

5121
02:37:25,630 --> 02:37:25,910
right?

5122
02:37:25,910 --> 02:37:26,061
You know,

5123
02:37:26,061 --> 02:37:28,340
if you know how much
that is an issue for me,

5124
02:37:28,670 --> 02:37:30,050
it's like Majid Majid,

5125
02:37:30,051 --> 02:37:30,291
nih,

5126
02:37:30,291 --> 02:37:32,240
or are just buddies now,

5127
02:37:32,241 --> 02:37:32,780
right?

5128
02:37:32,780 --> 02:37:37,780
So all I need is a clear path that he
took out of the darkness to understand why

5129
02:37:39,021 --> 02:37:40,460
he's a valid collaborator.

5130
02:37:40,460 --> 02:37:40,850
Now.

5131
02:37:40,850 --> 02:37:42,770
And actually on that point,

5132
02:37:42,771 --> 02:37:42,950
I,

5133
02:37:42,950 --> 02:37:46,220
I've got people breathing down my neck
to tell you that we're telling your

5134
02:37:46,221 --> 02:37:46,611
audience,

5135
02:37:46,611 --> 02:37:47,510
this is how powerful you are,

5136
02:37:47,511 --> 02:37:48,344
Joe Rogan.

5137
02:37:49,260 --> 02:37:52,640
That the documentary is coming
out on the collaboration and it's,

5138
02:37:52,641 --> 02:37:53,281
it's out now,

5139
02:37:53,281 --> 02:37:54,290
and so it can be found out,

5140
02:37:54,291 --> 02:37:56,750
there is what's called Islam
in the future of tolerance.

5141
02:37:56,930 --> 02:37:57,470
Nice.

5142
02:37:57,470 --> 02:37:58,303
And it's actually,

5143
02:37:58,350 --> 02:37:59,600
it's not bad.

5144
02:37:59,601 --> 02:38:02,570
It actually captures the spirit
of our collaboration very well.

5145
02:38:03,000 --> 02:38:03,530
Uh,

5146
02:38:03,530 --> 02:38:04,430
and you know,

5147
02:38:04,460 --> 02:38:08,720
see it if only to recognize how awesome
modular because modular is just a

5148
02:38:08,990 --> 02:38:13,990
superstar and the scariest thing about
the state of public opinion in the Muslim

5149
02:38:14,481 --> 02:38:16,730
world from my point of view is just how,

5150
02:38:18,800 --> 02:38:23,750
how hard a job he has to just to have
a conversation in that community.

5151
02:38:23,751 --> 02:38:24,291
I mean it's just,

5152
02:38:24,291 --> 02:38:24,500
you know,

5153
02:38:24,500 --> 02:38:29,210
he's so marginalized
and he's so reasonable,

5154
02:38:29,540 --> 02:38:29,990
you know.

5155
02:38:29,990 --> 02:38:30,940
But let me take,

5156
02:38:31,040 --> 02:38:32,330
come back to that original point.

5157
02:38:33,620 --> 02:38:34,940
Here's someone who was,

5158
02:38:35,450 --> 02:38:38,940
whose life was purposed toward what,

5159
02:38:39,530 --> 02:38:44,530
what I view as one of the most
toxic projects I can think of.

5160
02:38:46,430 --> 02:38:46,910
Right.

5161
02:38:46,910 --> 02:38:47,240
You know,

5162
02:38:47,240 --> 02:38:51,290
give the nuclear weapons to the
people who want to die as martyrs.

5163
02:38:51,440 --> 02:38:51,711
Right.

5164
02:38:51,711 --> 02:38:52,700
That's the project,

5165
02:38:52,720 --> 02:38:53,553
right?

5166
02:38:53,630 --> 02:38:58,630
And Majid has just absolutely
awesome collaborator now.

5167
02:38:58,820 --> 02:38:59,031
Right?

5168
02:38:59,031 --> 02:39:00,920
So there's like we have to,

5169
02:39:01,850 --> 02:39:06,850
there has to be a path through some
sane conversation to a reboot the wheel.

5170
02:39:08,380 --> 02:39:13,380
The worry though for a lot of folks is
that you are not really being honest

5171
02:39:13,701 --> 02:39:13,960
about you,

5172
02:39:13,960 --> 02:39:15,020
who you are currently.

5173
02:39:15,300 --> 02:39:17,510
You just want an excuse for,

5174
02:39:17,540 --> 02:39:17,900
for,

5175
02:39:17,900 --> 02:39:19,670
to be relieved.

5176
02:39:19,900 --> 02:39:21,860
It's so clear in some of these cases,

5177
02:39:21,920 --> 02:39:23,330
like it's clear me,

5178
02:39:23,331 --> 02:39:24,051
take him in the norm.

5179
02:39:24,051 --> 02:39:26,420
Mcdonald case is just utterly clear.

5180
02:39:26,870 --> 02:39:27,703
Right?

5181
02:39:27,770 --> 02:39:28,603
Um,

5182
02:39:28,610 --> 02:39:29,950
and I'm,

5183
02:39:30,000 --> 02:39:32,300
even though it may in Megan Kelly's case,

5184
02:39:32,420 --> 02:39:33,290
utterly clear,

5185
02:39:33,350 --> 02:39:38,090
like I don't think unless she's got
some white supremacist side Gig that I,

5186
02:39:38,180 --> 02:39:39,013
I'm not aware of.

5187
02:39:39,440 --> 02:39:40,550
She's just like,

5188
02:39:40,850 --> 02:39:41,331
listened,

5189
02:39:41,331 --> 02:39:42,200
I'm clueless.

5190
02:39:42,201 --> 02:39:42,561
I said,

5191
02:39:42,561 --> 02:39:42,741
you know,

5192
02:39:42,741 --> 02:39:43,610
I didn't realize.

5193
02:39:44,360 --> 02:39:46,610
Well they were looking for an
excuse to get rid of her honestly.

5194
02:39:46,970 --> 02:39:48,350
But I think that even if they weren't,

5195
02:39:48,351 --> 02:39:50,570
I think that still very likely
would have been the end.

5196
02:39:50,630 --> 02:39:53,480
I mean it's like even if her
show had had better ratings,

5197
02:39:53,570 --> 02:39:55,970
still that could have been
an unrecoverable error.

5198
02:39:56,340 --> 02:40:00,120
What if she was black when it
doesn't work the other direction?

5199
02:40:00,160 --> 02:40:02,120
They reverted back and she said,

5200
02:40:02,121 --> 02:40:03,690
what's so bad about blackface?

5201
02:40:04,430 --> 02:40:05,780
Well that she could stay on the air.

5202
02:40:07,190 --> 02:40:08,150
That's interesting.

5203
02:40:08,270 --> 02:40:09,103
I don't know.

5204
02:40:09,220 --> 02:40:11,930
I mean it certainly would've been easier.

5205
02:40:14,250 --> 02:40:14,780
Yeah.

5206
02:40:14,780 --> 02:40:15,600
What have overstaying.

5207
02:40:15,600 --> 02:40:16,500
Who Cares?

5208
02:40:17,250 --> 02:40:19,200
You want to pretend to be Diana
Ross because that was the,

5209
02:40:19,201 --> 02:40:19,630
the,

5210
02:40:19,630 --> 02:40:22,170
the thing was pretending to
be Diana Ross for Halloween,

5211
02:40:22,200 --> 02:40:22,700
right?

5212
02:40:22,700 --> 02:40:23,080
Yeah.

5213
02:40:23,080 --> 02:40:24,150
You want to be Diana Ross,

5214
02:40:24,200 --> 02:40:24,601
who was I?

5215
02:40:24,601 --> 02:40:26,250
I mean I got to think they
could get away with it,

5216
02:40:26,340 --> 02:40:28,050
but it's.

5217
02:40:28,900 --> 02:40:30,040
I mean it was interesting the,

5218
02:40:30,090 --> 02:40:34,080
the thing that happened with Louis ck
and Ricky Gervais' and Jerry Seinfeld and

5219
02:40:34,081 --> 02:40:34,914
Chris Rock,

5220
02:40:34,920 --> 02:40:35,753
that was.

5221
02:40:35,850 --> 02:40:37,290
Because I remember when that aired,

5222
02:40:37,350 --> 02:40:42,240
I think it was 2011 and I remember
there was nothing around that.

5223
02:40:42,241 --> 02:40:42,590
It was just,

5224
02:40:42,590 --> 02:40:43,620
it was totally fine.

5225
02:40:43,621 --> 02:40:43,920
Yeah,

5226
02:40:43,920 --> 02:40:44,570
right.

5227
02:40:44,570 --> 02:40:45,780
They were using the n word.

5228
02:40:45,810 --> 02:40:46,720
I mean the problem,

5229
02:40:48,600 --> 02:40:50,720
the thing that was kind
of dishonest about the,

5230
02:40:50,830 --> 02:40:51,150
the,

5231
02:40:51,150 --> 02:40:56,150
the re scandalizing of it was that
in the context of that conversation,

5232
02:40:57,150 --> 02:40:58,890
it was framed by

5233
02:41:00,720 --> 02:41:01,381
the fact that they,

5234
02:41:01,381 --> 02:41:06,260
they really were ref referencing one of
the more famous pieces of comedy and in

5235
02:41:06,300 --> 02:41:07,200
history and they read,

5236
02:41:07,230 --> 02:41:10,380
they were referencing Chris
Rock's act using the n word.

5237
02:41:10,610 --> 02:41:15,610
They're the black people and then
their ends and you Louis Rnn,

5238
02:41:15,720 --> 02:41:16,051
right.

5239
02:41:16,051 --> 02:41:16,151
Like,

5240
02:41:16,151 --> 02:41:16,650
like,

5241
02:41:16,650 --> 02:41:17,940
you're the only white guy I know who.

5242
02:41:18,390 --> 02:41:19,500
And then they're.

5243
02:41:19,501 --> 02:41:23,970
So they're talking to in
that context and anyway.

5244
02:41:23,971 --> 02:41:24,121
Yeah,

5245
02:41:24,121 --> 02:41:24,241
it was,

5246
02:41:24,241 --> 02:41:26,310
it was interesting how that almost,

5247
02:41:26,340 --> 02:41:30,960
I mean that blew back against ricky and
one of those things where they're just

5248
02:41:30,961 --> 02:41:33,090
looking for more things
to be mad at Louis for.

5249
02:41:33,630 --> 02:41:33,931
Yeah.

5250
02:41:33,931 --> 02:41:34,530
But I mean,

5251
02:41:34,530 --> 02:41:35,370
but ricky was also,

5252
02:41:36,090 --> 02:41:38,460
I think Chris Rock was a lot of shit.

5253
02:41:38,461 --> 02:41:38,731
Yeah.

5254
02:41:38,731 --> 02:41:41,040
He took a lot of shit for
that because he didn't.

5255
02:41:41,100 --> 02:41:42,180
There was no blowback.

5256
02:41:42,620 --> 02:41:43,410
Yeah.

5257
02:41:43,410 --> 02:41:44,243
Yeah.

5258
02:41:44,820 --> 02:41:45,750
Interesting Times.

5259
02:41:46,200 --> 02:41:46,980
Yes.

5260
02:41:46,980 --> 02:41:47,970
That's probably a good way to end it.

5261
02:41:49,420 --> 02:41:50,400
Did three hours.

5262
02:41:50,500 --> 02:41:50,850
Yeah,

5263
02:41:50,850 --> 02:41:51,300
it is.

5264
02:41:51,300 --> 02:41:52,530
It is interesting times.

5265
02:41:52,531 --> 02:41:52,741
I mean,

5266
02:41:52,741 --> 02:41:56,550
it's probably the most interesting times
of our lives in good ways and bad ways.

5267
02:41:56,900 --> 02:41:57,300
Yeah.

5268
02:41:57,300 --> 02:41:58,081
Well we're,

5269
02:41:58,081 --> 02:41:58,914
um,

5270
02:41:59,220 --> 02:42:00,420
we're on the front lines of something,

5271
02:42:01,520 --> 02:42:01,900
you know,

5272
02:42:01,900 --> 02:42:02,733
I,

5273
02:42:02,830 --> 02:42:04,770
I don't know if you get
enough credit for this,

5274
02:42:04,771 --> 02:42:05,670
but you have like,

5275
02:42:06,300 --> 02:42:10,290
you pushed out into the space
that no one even knew existed.

5276
02:42:10,320 --> 02:42:11,010
And Emma,

5277
02:42:11,010 --> 02:42:11,790
you're like,

5278
02:42:11,790 --> 02:42:16,790
I honestly didn't even know what a podcast
was when I learned what a podcast was

5279
02:42:18,811 --> 02:42:19,644
when I got invited.

5280
02:42:19,830 --> 02:42:21,630
Get interviewed on your
podcast the first time,

5281
02:42:21,660 --> 02:42:21,841
you know,

5282
02:42:21,841 --> 02:42:22,674
so it's like,

5283
02:42:22,950 --> 02:42:23,783
it's awesome what,

5284
02:42:24,300 --> 02:42:25,140
what you've created here.

5285
02:42:25,141 --> 02:42:25,974
So thank you.

5286
02:42:26,180 --> 02:42:26,850
It's all,

5287
02:42:26,850 --> 02:42:27,683
it's an accident.

5288
02:42:28,080 --> 02:42:28,913
I just stuck with it,

5289
02:42:29,160 --> 02:42:30,120
stumbled upon it,

5290
02:42:30,720 --> 02:42:31,560
and kept going.

5291
02:42:32,130 --> 02:42:32,460
Well,

5292
02:42:32,460 --> 02:42:33,120
I'm good at that.

5293
02:42:33,120 --> 02:42:33,953
Keep it up.

5294
02:42:33,960 --> 02:42:34,770
Thank you.

5295
02:42:34,770 --> 02:42:35,131
Thank you.

5296
02:42:35,131 --> 02:42:35,940
You too.

5297
02:42:35,940 --> 02:42:36,240
Excellent.

5298
02:42:36,240 --> 02:42:36,841
Sam Harris,

5299
02:42:36,841 --> 02:42:37,674
ladies and gentlemen.

5300
02:42:40,690 --> 02:42:41,523
Right.

5301
02:42:42,580 --> 02:42:43,413
Awesome.

5302
02:43:00,180 --> 02:43:00,380
Okay.
