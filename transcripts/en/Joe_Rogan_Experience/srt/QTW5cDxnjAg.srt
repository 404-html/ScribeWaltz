00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:05,150
Three,

00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:07,640

Roseanne,

10
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:19,820
Okay,
cool.

11
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:21,560
All right dude.
Well nice to meet you guys.

12
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:23,750
I've met you before,
but nice to meet you.

13
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:25,850
Um,
for people who don't know,

14
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:29,900
let's just give them right off the bat.
Your story would happen to you.

15
00:00:29,901 --> 00:00:31,790
How you got in trouble in Canada for a 
joke.

16
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:33,820
Real trouble.
Real trouble.

17
00:00:33,821 --> 00:00:37,160
I got,
I'm find $42,000

18
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:39,950
a Canadian or American Canadian,
uh,

19
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:40,843
which was,
uh,

20
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:44,390
like now close to 42,000
American reference.

21
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:45,303
It was,
um,

22
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:47,480
yeah,
let's say like 38,000

23
00:00:47,481 --> 00:00:48,720
American.
And uh,

24
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:49,603
there's a thing in Canada called the 
human rights commission that every 

25
00:00:52,581 --> 00:00:55,610
province has one of those.
I had a joke about,

26
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:59,000
I'm a little boy that was famous.
He was a singer.

27
00:00:59,001 --> 00:01:00,230
He was a disabled boy.

28
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:01,790
And the,
the joke,

29
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:02,923
it wasn't even that mean it was just a 
little kid that was disabled and he was 

30
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:07,163
uh,
he was Kinda like a make a wish 

31
00:01:08,931 --> 00:01:11,570
foundation type kid.
And he was famous in Canada.

32
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:12,404
He was famous in French Canada.
He had sang for the pope and the joke 

33
00:01:15,741 --> 00:01:16,574
was like,
I was super happy for him at first it's 

34
00:01:18,441 --> 00:01:20,090
a little deaf boy.
He's dying.

35
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:21,103
He,
his dream was to sync for the pope and 

36
00:01:22,261 --> 00:01:26,300
then he became like a,
like front page news on a,

37
00:01:26,301 --> 00:01:27,860
you know,
everywhere in Montreal.

38
00:01:27,861 --> 00:01:28,694
And then he,
he got a record deal and then he sang 

39
00:01:30,171 --> 00:01:32,480
for the Canadians.
Then he came out with a book and then at

40
00:01:32,481 --> 00:01:34,400
the end I was like,
why isn't he dead yet?

41
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:35,810
Like,
wasn't he supposed to die?

42
00:01:35,811 --> 00:01:39,860
That's just the basic stuff.
Like he's a little dark joke.

43
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:40,791
Yeah.
Like,

44
00:01:40,791 --> 00:01:42,170
it's what I do is dark humor.

45
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:43,910
Like I'm not,
I'm not Ray Romano.

46
00:01:43,911 --> 00:01:46,780
Right.
So I did that joke and uh,

47
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:50,150
in never did that joke on TV.
Did that joke in a special.

48
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:54,350
The Dea didn't air on TV.
I cut a couple of things out for TV.

49
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:55,650
But uh,
I,

50
00:01:55,650 --> 00:02:00,320
I get a letter from the human rights 
people saying you owe 80.

51
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:03,440
First it was they wanted 82,000
for the joke.

52
00:02:03,441 --> 00:02:04,880
They were like,
we listened to the joke.

53
00:02:04,881 --> 00:02:09,100
We think that this boy's family deserves
82,000

54
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:11,330
[inaudible] of this joke.
What a weird number.

55
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:16,280
And I thought I thought they were like 
this how fucking stupid I am.

56
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,400
When I got the letter and I saw human 
rights commission,

57
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:23,380
I thought I was getting an award or a 
prize or something because I,

58
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:26,180
I do,
I do a lot of benefits and stuff.

59
00:02:26,181 --> 00:02:28,430
But for,
I raised money for disabled people.

60
00:02:28,431 --> 00:02:29,241
So I was like,
fuck,

61
00:02:29,241 --> 00:02:32,500
it's a bad time.
They recognize me as a good dude.

62
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:36,920
So I read this and then I called my 
manager and I'm like,

63
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:39,760
fuck,
they want 80,000.

64
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:41,420
And we were like,
okay,

65
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:46,450
let's just get the best lawyer we can.
So I found the best lawyer in Canada,

66
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:49,700
uh,
that does a free speech stuff.

67
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:53,280
Met Him and he told me the reason why it
was $80,000,

68
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:54,950
$80,000
is a weird number.

69
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:58,370
Like if they ask a 2 million,
you're going to fight it,

70
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:00,120
but 80,000

71
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:04,420
is big enough to kind of scare you but 
not enough to really scare you.

72
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,350
You'll go like,
look,

73
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:07,780
okay,
can I give you a 40 and then they'll go,

74
00:03:07,781 --> 00:03:09,280
okay,
give me a few questions.

75
00:03:09,281 --> 00:03:11,140
So this bit you said you cut it from the
special.

76
00:03:11,141 --> 00:03:12,550
Right.
So how do they know about it?

77
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:13,301
Uh,
it was,

78
00:03:13,301 --> 00:03:17,730
um,
I did this interview on TV and the um,

79
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:21,040
the reporter talked about the bit he had
never seen the bit.

80
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:22,043
Oh,
so how did he know about someone told 

81
00:03:23,441 --> 00:03:25,790
them about the bed,
but the bed was in the special,

82
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:27,910
the specialist.
So it was on the Internet.

83
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:29,440
So you could watch it.
Yeah,

84
00:03:29,441 --> 00:03:30,274
you could watch it on the Internet and 
this special had been in movie theaters 

85
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:35,560
in Canada.
It's just when we sold it on TV,

86
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:39,220
this in French was in French.
That's what I was weird.

87
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:42,910
Whenever people were talking about the 
bit they were like,

88
00:03:42,911 --> 00:03:43,744
it was,
especially in Canada and in England 

89
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,073
where it's very left leaning.
People were talking shit about the bit 

90
00:03:50,501 --> 00:03:51,320
and I was like,
you,

91
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,860
you can't even understand that joke.
That's in a language.

92
00:03:53,861 --> 00:03:57,280
You don't speak about a person you don't
know.

93
00:03:57,281 --> 00:04:02,281
So the people almost made it look like I
just picked this random disabled boy and

94
00:04:03,641 --> 00:04:07,930
I was making fun of his disability,
but I was making fun of the fact that he

95
00:04:07,931 --> 00:04:08,764
had become famous because everyone 
thought he was dying and then he didn't 

96
00:04:10,931 --> 00:04:12,190
die,
which is a,

97
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:14,710
you know,
for him it's a dark joke.

98
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:15,563
It's all.
It is.

99
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:17,560
Not even that particularly mean.
No,

100
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,240
it's a question really.
You're not saying,

101
00:04:19,241 --> 00:04:20,230
hey,
why don't you die?

102
00:04:20,231 --> 00:04:21,760
I spent money.
You little fuck yeah.

103
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:23,060
And say that.
No.

104
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:25,000
You said how come he's alive?

105
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:25,863
Yeah,
exactly.

106
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:30,610
And when I did the thing for TV,
I cut a couple things out that I thought

107
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:33,010
could get me in trouble because I 
figured,

108
00:04:33,011 --> 00:04:33,844
you know,
when you put out a special and people 

109
00:04:35,501 --> 00:04:38,740
pay for the special,
you should be allowed.

110
00:04:38,741 --> 00:04:39,574
And I still think this and this.
I think everyone should think this way 

111
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:43,263
if it like if you put out a special,
you should be allowed to say whatever 

112
00:04:45,911 --> 00:04:49,600
the fuck you want to say.
But if you sell your special to like CBS

113
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:52,180
or ABC,
then of course they're going to cut shit

114
00:04:52,181 --> 00:04:53,350
out of course.
But like your,

115
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:57,340
your last special on Netflix.
It'd be crazy if netflix had looked joe,

116
00:04:57,341 --> 00:05:00,630
we fucking loved your special but this,
you got to cut this out.

117
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:02,740
You've got to cut this into netflix 
credit.

118
00:05:02,741 --> 00:05:04,270
That's one of the reasons why they're so
amazing.

119
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:05,123
They,
they don't give you hardly any input at 

120
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:07,330
all.

121
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:08,051
Those there go,
hey,

122
00:05:08,051 --> 00:05:10,300
we really liked it.
It's like they don't do anything.

123
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:11,390
Yeah,
they uh,

124
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:12,303
you know,
I had some controversial shit and this 

125
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:16,420
one in my last one,
they just let it go.

126
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,550
That's much appreciated.
Yeah.

127
00:05:18,551 --> 00:05:21,040
I was really happy when I saw your last 
special.

128
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:25,840
I thought it was the perfect thing to,
to come back from a Nanette,

129
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:28,120
like the,
the gatsby special.

130
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:32,360
It's an important special,
but it's not funny and it's like,

131
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:33,470
it's almost,
you know what it is,

132
00:05:33,471 --> 00:05:34,560
it's her art,
right?

133
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:37,270
The problem is we're putting it in this 
box,

134
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,280
right?
You're saying that standup comedy.

135
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:43,620
But if you do something and it has some 
laughs in it and then it goes on this,

136
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,833
this by this journey,
biographical journey of your life and 

137
00:05:47,981 --> 00:05:48,814
your ubs observations and you,
you say it in a way that's meaningful 

138
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,360
and people still enjoy it,
but it's not funny anymore.

139
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:57,980
It's still I,
a lot

140
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:58,813
of comics didn't like it.
A lot of columns got upset and I was 

141
00:06:01,071 --> 00:06:01,904
like,
okay,

142
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:05,180
I get,
I get why you would say it's not comedy,

143
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:09,350
but I don't get why you would get upset.
Because obviously people like it.

144
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:14,530
Like I don't get upset if people like 
certain books or certain songs that like

145
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:17,780
the.
I have a good friend who likes fish,

146
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,450
you know?
I mean I don't hate fish,

147
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,200
but it's not my cup of tea.
Right.

148
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:24,770
It's not a bad.
That makes me upset that your friend,

149
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:28,100
your friend likes fit.
He said Jamie,

150
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:30,200
Jamie,
Jamie,

151
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,050
Jamie and I have nothing against fish.
I just,

152
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:35,190
maybe I need to listen to it.
Hi.

153
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:37,470
Maybe I need.
Jamie says no js.

154
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:40,550
It's not jamie like that.
That Hannah gatsby special.

155
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:41,413
Like I really wanted to watch it because
I didn't want to be some guy that 

156
00:06:43,581 --> 00:06:45,410
listened to three minutes said,
fuck you.

157
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:48,380
So I did listen to it and I do get why 
it.

158
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:49,413
It's in,
it's an important special and I think 

159
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,890
it's good for what it is,
but I,

160
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:57,860
I didn't like the fact that people were 
saying this is comedy in time.

161
00:06:57,861 --> 00:07:01,280
Came out with the list,
the most hilarious specials and that was

162
00:07:01,281 --> 00:07:02,114
number one at a time when it's like a 
diversity Olympia toward told thing is 

163
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,630
it's all very diverse.
There's some funny people on it,

164
00:07:08,631 --> 00:07:11,480
no doubt,
but you can still like these lists.

165
00:07:11,481 --> 00:07:12,314
First of all,
these lists are always weird because 

166
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:14,983
especially when it's someone's 
subjective opinion and there's nothing 

167
00:07:17,481 --> 00:07:18,650
wrong with that,
but it like,

168
00:07:18,651 --> 00:07:19,790
who the fuck are you?
Like,

169
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:22,130
who's this?
Who's this person?

170
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:23,023
I would like to see Chris Rock's list of
top 10 comedians or top 10 comedy 

171
00:07:27,141 --> 00:07:30,980
specials or someone like that.
Someone who's who I know who they are.

172
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:34,610
I understand their thought process.
Maybe this person is a famous writer.

173
00:07:34,611 --> 00:07:35,444
I don't know that.
I don't know if they're famous 

174
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:38,710
journalist.
I like to see like Matt Tie ebs,

175
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:39,853
like top 10 movies,
but it's like a certain tea gets to 

176
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:45,250
these top 10 things and you're like,
who sits here?

177
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:47,960
This is all so subjective.
It's so weird.

178
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:50,960
And the like,
the Nanette thing is,

179
00:07:50,961 --> 00:07:52,160
um,
I need to watch it.

180
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,770
I've only watched parts of it,
um,

181
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:59,050
but that my reaction to it was my 
reaction to everybody else's reaction.

182
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:01,070
So I'm like,
what is going on here?

183
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:04,700
Either it's the most amazing thing ever 
or some sort of an affront to comedy,

184
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,750
you know?
And either it gets a bit of both because

185
00:08:08,751 --> 00:08:10,250
I think it is like,
it's,

186
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:14,720
it's like a lot of people were saying 
it's like a Ted talk and I think it kind

187
00:08:14,721 --> 00:08:15,140
of is.

188
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:17,810
It's a funny Ted talk.
Nothing wrong with that,

189
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:18,713
right?
There's nothing.

190
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:19,603
I mean this is my point on all this.
It's like why do we need these sort of 

191
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:26,083
parameters that comedy has to stay in 
before we accept it because it doesn't 

192
00:08:30,321 --> 00:08:34,760
have to be your kind of shit for it to 
be something that people enjoy.

193
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:35,623
Obviously someone enjoys it.
There's a lot of people enjoying it 

194
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,260
because it's not.
There's some of those.

195
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:40,850
When they make those lists,
were you like,

196
00:08:40,851 --> 00:08:43,160
let's include this person,
let's include that.

197
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:45,550
We've got to make sure we have x amount 
of women and x amount.

198
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:46,573
You could see there's almost like 
there's a thought process behind 

199
00:08:48,801 --> 00:08:49,634
creating these lists,
but some of those people will appear on 

200
00:08:52,461 --> 00:08:53,900
those lists over and over and over 
again.

201
00:08:53,901 --> 00:08:56,250
So that means to me,
for sure.

202
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:57,143
Somebody loves that special that's 
special is like number one on so many 

203
00:09:00,751 --> 00:09:03,120
people's lists,
not just number two or number three.

204
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,400
It's number one.
A lot of people's lists,

205
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,650
so someone's enjoying it.
So like,

206
00:09:07,651 --> 00:09:09,460
what do I give a shit?
What does anybody give a shit?

207
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:12,480
Was my reaction is my reaction to these 
comics that are like upset?

208
00:09:12,481 --> 00:09:13,740
I'm like,
but why?

209
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,670
But why are I remember why I remember 
why they got mad.

210
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:17,523
It wasn't because they were saying it's 
the number one special is because she 

211
00:09:19,681 --> 00:09:22,320
went on an interview I think in 
Australia and said,

212
00:09:22,321 --> 00:09:24,960
if you're a comedian who only cares 
about making people laugh,

213
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:27,960
then you should stop doing comedy.
You shouldn't be in show business,

214
00:09:27,961 --> 00:09:30,720
they shouldn't see you publicly,
you should give a message.

215
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:33,720
Right.
But I disagree with that strongly,

216
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:37,530
but from her perspective,
what she's trying to do,

217
00:09:37,531 --> 00:09:39,750
it's like someone who's really into rock
and roll that like,

218
00:09:39,751 --> 00:09:41,010
fuck rap,
music,

219
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:44,440
rock and roll,
you know,

220
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:45,780
that's what they're saying.

221
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:46,980
I mean,
that's what she's saying.

222
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:50,280
She's doing it in like a comedic form.
She's like,

223
00:09:50,281 --> 00:09:51,840
if you're only in a comedy that makes 
people laugh,

224
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:52,920
fuck you.
Kinda.

225
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,400
Yeah,
you're,

226
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:57,620
I'm in the deep comedy bitch.
I mean,

227
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:59,063
there's nothing wrong with one of my 
favorite all time standards for sure is 

228
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:04,470
Mitch Hedberg and Mitch Hedberg had all 
nonsequitors.

229
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:05,503
Nothing was.
There's no deep meaning to any of it 

230
00:10:06,661 --> 00:10:07,494
all.
It was like super silly and still to 

231
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:11,160
this day like,
especially if I'm in traffic,

232
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,650
I'll listen to that shit because it's 
just so silly,

233
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:15,390
you know?
He's fucking.

234
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,940
It was amazing,
but it's just that his,

235
00:10:17,941 --> 00:10:18,774
his expression and everybody's 
expression is going to be different and 

236
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,360
this is something I've figured out over 
the course of my.

237
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:25,253
I mean,
I didn't get it right all the time when 

238
00:10:26,101 --> 00:10:27,600
I was young.
I was like,

239
00:10:27,601 --> 00:10:28,460
you know,
I,

240
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:31,740
I hated people that didn't swear and I 
was like,

241
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:34,740
there's no way you talk like that for 
real.

242
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:36,420
There's no way you talk like that for 
real.

243
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:38,070
But then after awhile I was like,
why do I care?

244
00:10:38,071 --> 00:10:40,920
Do some of the best ever.
Don't swear like Jerry Seinfeld.

245
00:10:40,921 --> 00:10:43,320
He doesn't swear.
So one of the best comedians of all time

246
00:10:43,321 --> 00:10:44,154
is,
it's not even a subjective question or 

247
00:10:48,271 --> 00:10:49,620
an opinion like you,
you,

248
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,480
everybody knows he's one of the best.
However,

249
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:53,820
if you have 100 comedians that,
to the best ever,

250
00:10:53,821 --> 00:10:55,950
Jerry Seinfeld's none the,
your that lists bullshit.

251
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,740
Brian Regan hilarious.
Doesn't swear it off.

252
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:00,203
You know,
like there's a lot of great comics who 

253
00:11:02,551 --> 00:11:04,980
just have their thing.
Like there's,

254
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,560
there's comics that have puppets that 
are really funny.

255
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:10,920
Like you just because you have a puppet,
it doesn't mean you're not really funny.

256
00:11:10,921 --> 00:11:13,020
But for a lot of comics,
for Qms,

257
00:11:13,021 --> 00:11:13,854
go to papa.
Yeah,

258
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:15,720
it's weird.
I'm not there yet.

259
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:19,380
I just felt like everything else I was 
on Bart.

260
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:22,680
I was like,
do you ever say auto and George?

261
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:23,680
Yeah,
George.

262
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:24,583
But,
but that was almost making fun of the 

263
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,193
whole thing,
but the end that I fucking love that 

264
00:11:29,641 --> 00:11:33,690
people would get mad at him because his 
lips moved to fucking move bro.

265
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:37,860
He wasn't even trying to hide it.
It was just funny.

266
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,030
You know,
there was a,

267
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:41,910
there's been a few really fun a puppet 
acts,

268
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,900
you know?
Um,

269
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:46,350
I mean,
who gives a shit?

270
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:48,240
Do whatever the fuck you like,
you know,

271
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:49,163
I think that's a thing though when 
you're in your twenties that anything 

272
00:11:52,051 --> 00:11:55,480
that isn't what you do are you like,
is garbage,

273
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:56,370
right?
Yeah.

274
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:59,140
Because I remember I was like that too,
like a plus.

275
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:00,970
Like that was I think a,
uh,

276
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:04,600
thing about being in your twenties in 
the nineties because we had just had,

277
00:12:04,601 --> 00:12:05,860
you know,
Kennison and,

278
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:06,990
and you know,
uh,

279
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:09,700
like Bill Hicks and so,
so if,

280
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:12,360
if you were doing like a,
like,

281
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:13,773
like Jeff Foxworthy were,
we were judging you but we shouldn't 

282
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:17,200
like,
yeah,

283
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:17,800
who gives a shit?

284
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,410
Yeah.
Jeff foxworthy parameters.

285
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,160
Like the nicest guy in the history of 
the world.

286
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,080
Yeah.
He looks nice.

287
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,640
I'd never met him.
Larry the cable guy's nice as fuck.

288
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:28,450
He's super sweet and he got super judged
too hard.

289
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,810
People went hard on him.
Dave crossroad a crazy letter to him.

290
00:12:31,811 --> 00:12:34,390
Like a letter from Dave,
the desk of days cross.

291
00:12:34,391 --> 00:12:36,430
It was free.
It was like tongue in cheek,

292
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:37,743
but it's.
The idea was that he was somehow or 

293
00:12:39,431 --> 00:12:42,370
another promoting racism.
I think that was what people said.

294
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:45,730
He's doing a character.
His real name's Dan Whitney.

295
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:49,240
His character is really dumb guy who 
doesn't have sleeves,

296
00:12:49,241 --> 00:12:51,670
who's fucking hilarious and it's good 
character.

297
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:54,550
His character isn't racist,
the racist,

298
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:57,160
but you know,
there's like these lands I looked,

299
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:58,023
there's once you run out of like really 
high profile targets that are actually 

300
00:13:01,181 --> 00:13:02,014
racist,
then you have to like find things are 

301
00:13:04,331 --> 00:13:05,910
close to that.

302
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:07,750
I don't know what you're saying.
I don't like what you're saying there.

303
00:13:07,751 --> 00:13:10,720
What are you saying about Asian people?
Like don't do it,

304
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:13,090
don't you fucking.
I mean there's some,

305
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:14,403
there's some things you could still get,
like there's some like absolute 

306
00:13:17,471 --> 00:13:20,500
realities that you,
you can say,

307
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:21,760
right?
Like you could say,

308
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:22,623
Asian people in generally have higher 
iqs and they're better at math as a 

309
00:13:25,391 --> 00:13:26,224
fact,
Joe.

310
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:28,690
That's a solid fact,
you know,

311
00:13:28,691 --> 00:13:31,360
but if it goes the other way,
if it's positive,

312
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:32,530
right,
you can always do it.

313
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:36,010
The thing about white people is we're 
not as smart as Asians.

314
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,600
See,
I could say that because I'm white,

315
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:41,080
but if I was Asian and I was like,
white people are just not as smart.

316
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:45,850
Even though it's true like terms of Iq 
tests and mathematics in particular,

317
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,110
they're just fucking smarter.
There's so,

318
00:13:47,111 --> 00:13:47,710
so much smarter.

319
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:49,350
You know what they're doing in Harvard.
Yeah.

320
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,830
See this shit.
They're.

321
00:13:50,831 --> 00:13:54,760
They're making it more difficult for 
Asian students to get into Harvard.

322
00:13:54,761 --> 00:13:58,630
There's a class action lawsuit because 
they've actually raised the score levels

323
00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:01,600
that Asians have to achieve because 
there's so many of them.

324
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:02,410
Fast,
racist,

325
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:05,560
and that's actual racism.
Phrase this super racist,

326
00:14:05,561 --> 00:14:09,280
fucking racist,
but you don't hear leftwing people,

327
00:14:09,281 --> 00:14:10,114
progressive people calling out that kind
of racism because because of the way 

328
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:18,520
many Asian cultures have sort of 
structured their society,

329
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:19,743
people don't complain as much and they 
work hard and they like fucking put 

330
00:14:23,051 --> 00:14:23,884
their nose to the grindstone and they 
get going and this is part of their 

331
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:30,850
culture and so when something like this 
happens there,

332
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:31,983
they have to break out of those norms in
order to protest is really obvious 

333
00:14:35,141 --> 00:14:38,350
racism and because they really haven't 
done that before,

334
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:41,380
they just sort of silently working hard.

335
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:44,000
Harvard just decided,
no,

336
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:47,170
it's too many of you.
You fucking smarty pants,

337
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:49,950
Asian folk.
So.

338
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:52,430
Well a few people have.
Jordan Peterson has.

339
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:54,380
Sam Harris has,
you know,

340
00:14:54,381 --> 00:14:59,140
there's a few recognized public minds.
I would,

341
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:01,310
you know the word intellectual,
such a weird word,

342
00:15:01,311 --> 00:15:02,270
right?
Public intellectuals,

343
00:15:02,271 --> 00:15:05,750
but those guys are definitely public 
intellectuals where they have these long

344
00:15:05,751 --> 00:15:06,584
form discussions.
I don't remember watching on the 

345
00:15:07,401 --> 00:15:08,900
Internet.
They're doing these debates together.

346
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:11,960
Fascinating man.
It's really fascinating.

347
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:12,853
Especially they're just there 
discussions about religion because 

348
00:15:14,781 --> 00:15:17,380
Jordan is fairly religious,
but the.

349
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:18,890
He's got a really interesting way of 
putting it.

350
00:15:18,891 --> 00:15:21,800
He says he,
he acts as if God is real,

351
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:23,323
not that he believes in God,
but that he acts as if God is real and 

352
00:15:25,281 --> 00:15:28,070
he finds great benefit to that,
which is very arguable.

353
00:15:28,071 --> 00:15:30,770
Right.
And that Harris is like not buying it at

354
00:15:30,771 --> 00:15:32,180
all and he's brilliant too.

355
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:33,380
So the two of them together,
it's like,

356
00:15:33,381 --> 00:15:34,310
wow,
this is,

357
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:35,833
this is a fascinating.
It's like really cool high level 

358
00:15:38,151 --> 00:15:42,050
conversation and you get to sit in on.
The thing I like about Darren Peterson,

359
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,850
I've noticed whenever I watch his 
interviews,

360
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:47,270
he,
he thinks like sometimes like if someone

361
00:15:47,271 --> 00:15:51,260
asks them a question,
you'll see them stop and think to really

362
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:54,710
see where he's gone.
Whereas like a dumb guy like me,

363
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:56,740
I just started talking and I'm like,
ah,

364
00:15:56,741 --> 00:16:01,741
I'll eventually out.
He knows exactly what he's saying,

365
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:03,373
you know,
especially in regards to like Marxist 

366
00:16:05,151 --> 00:16:07,460
history and things that he gets very 
upset about.

367
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:08,443
You know,
he gets,

368
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:09,403
he's,
he's,

369
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:13,320
he's having these conversations like 
literally on a daily basis.

370
00:16:13,321 --> 00:16:14,154
So was going over a lot of these 
grievances and a lot of the material he 

371
00:16:16,431 --> 00:16:18,410
talks about,
he's going over to a lot.

372
00:16:18,411 --> 00:16:22,160
So he's got that shit bolted down and he
got in trouble too with the human rights

373
00:16:22,161 --> 00:16:23,300
commission in Ontario.

374
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:24,223
Yeah.
He got in trouble because they were 

375
00:16:25,611 --> 00:16:26,444
going to force people to use compelled 
pronouns and there were some weird 

376
00:16:30,081 --> 00:16:30,914
language that he didn't like about the 
way they could enforce it or what they 

377
00:16:33,711 --> 00:16:36,950
were asking people to do.
And then it got to the point where we're

378
00:16:36,951 --> 00:16:37,650
saying,
well,

379
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:38,483
we're talking about made up words now.
Like it gets to a certain point where 

380
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:42,560
people get,
look,

381
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:45,170
people are fucking self-indulgent.
We all know it.

382
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:46,480
We all know it.
And,

383
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,353
and,
but there's also the other side of it 

384
00:16:48,651 --> 00:16:49,431
says,
well,

385
00:16:49,431 --> 00:16:50,264
people also should be able to express 
themselves as freely as you guys get to 

386
00:16:53,061 --> 00:16:53,894
do on stage.
Why can't they do that with their name 

387
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:58,490
or their gender or you know,
whatever the fuck they want.

388
00:16:58,491 --> 00:17:01,940
And why do you care if it's so simple to
just say whatever the fuck they want you

389
00:17:01,941 --> 00:17:02,900
to say,
you know,

390
00:17:02,901 --> 00:17:04,520
it's just a name,
right?

391
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:05,563
Xer or all those.
But Jordan was like there 78 different 

392
00:17:09,201 --> 00:17:11,720
ones.
Now we can't do this like this is,

393
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:13,530
this is chaos.
And I like,

394
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:15,503
I'm very pro trans,
like you can do whatever the fuck you 

395
00:17:19,251 --> 00:17:21,360
want to do,
but it's the same as like onstage,

396
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:23,570
I can do whatever the fuck I want to do 
on state,

397
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:25,910
but that doesn't mean you have to come 
see me.

398
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:28,700
And it's the same thing if you want to 
be called Zur,

399
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:29,893
I don't even know what the fuck that is.
So I'm accidentally going to call you 

400
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:34,740
her or him.
Yeah,

401
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,460
that can definitely happen.
And you can't get upset at that.

402
00:17:37,461 --> 00:17:42,230
No one knows what the fuck is.
And plus like if you get it wrong,

403
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,520
it's an accident,
right?

404
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:44,893
There's a difference between you being 
on stage because it was like a choice 

405
00:17:47,421 --> 00:17:48,231
with your life,
right?

406
00:17:48,231 --> 00:17:49,470
You decided to be a comedian

407
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:51,750
is an argument there.
Right.

408
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:54,390
And then the other side is,
well they didn't have a choice.

409
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:55,060
They,
they,

410
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:55,893
they feel compelled,
like they actually are of the other 

411
00:17:58,141 --> 00:17:59,680
gender and they,
they,

412
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:00,613
their brain is wired like the other 
gender and their body just isn't what 

413
00:18:03,931 --> 00:18:05,910
they're supposed to have and it's 
fucking with their head.

414
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:07,710
Got It.
Okay.

415
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,410
I'm cool with that too.
You know,

416
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:11,490
like I don't.
It's fine.

417
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:12,773
As long as you're not interfering with 
other people's lives because of your 

418
00:18:16,021 --> 00:18:17,030
choices.
Like if you're not,

419
00:18:17,031 --> 00:18:19,440
you're not fucking with me.
I don't have to do anything.

420
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:20,940
I just have to call you.
She now okay.

421
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,350
Yeah,
as long as I know.

422
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,161
Yeah,
I'm uncomfortable.

423
00:18:23,161 --> 00:18:25,560
I don't.
Why would you bully someone on purpose?

424
00:18:25,561 --> 00:18:26,394
You know it's going to fuck with them.
His problem was that he didn't want it 

425
00:18:28,951 --> 00:18:31,290
to be compelled because they need to get
in trouble if you fuck up.

426
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:32,640
Exactly.
Exactly.

427
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,260
And this is,
this is what he's talking about.

428
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:35,123
He has no problem calling a male who 
transitioned to female girl or she or 

429
00:18:39,091 --> 00:18:40,170
her,
but he's like,

430
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,620
you can't use these.
You can't compel me to use these made up

431
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:43,463
words.
Because at a certain point when these 

432
00:18:45,811 --> 00:18:46,644
things get rolling,
they become contests and they become 

433
00:18:49,741 --> 00:18:53,480
this battle.
It's an idea battle.

434
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:56,100
Which side are you on?
And they try to win.

435
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:57,143
It's one of the problems that I have 
with police officers and even the court 

436
00:18:59,851 --> 00:19:00,684
system that what happens when you get a 
prosecutor and a defense attorney is 

437
00:19:05,761 --> 00:19:08,040
there's a contest going on and these 
guys,

438
00:19:08,041 --> 00:19:08,874
they are involved in this contest 
multiple times a week with a bunch of 

439
00:19:12,691 --> 00:19:15,240
different cases and they're moving 
things around all the time,

440
00:19:15,241 --> 00:19:18,270
but they're constantly trying to win.
This is what they're trying to do.

441
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,780
When a cop pulls you over and he,
he gets you for something,

442
00:19:21,781 --> 00:19:23,040
he's trying to arrest you.

443
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:24,870
He's trying to win.
Like we were playing a game.

444
00:19:24,871 --> 00:19:25,704
Now you know this is,
he's allowed to play this game and this 

445
00:19:28,351 --> 00:19:30,120
is what he's supposed to do and you 
know,

446
00:19:30,121 --> 00:19:30,954
he's got every right to do it.
So he's going to search your home and 

447
00:19:32,281 --> 00:19:33,960
it'll shoot your dog because you have 
weed.

448
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:35,430
And this is where all this stuff comes 
from.

449
00:19:35,431 --> 00:19:36,264
It comes to these,
this insane justification for these 

450
00:19:38,161 --> 00:19:38,994
ridiculous axe comes from the fact that 
you've been given a set of rules in 

451
00:19:42,031 --> 00:19:42,864
order to participate in this game,
but the game when it comes to like 

452
00:19:46,171 --> 00:19:50,580
things like compelled pronouns and when 
it becomes too like pushing the envelope

453
00:19:50,581 --> 00:19:53,070
further and further and further at a 
certain point in time,

454
00:19:53,071 --> 00:19:55,800
you can't say no you,
you can't make up a new language.

455
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:56,820
Okay?
Agreed.

456
00:19:56,910 --> 00:19:58,320
Okay.
You can't make a new bill lang.

457
00:19:58,430 --> 00:19:59,010
You know,
I can't.

458
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:00,220
I don't have to learn,
you know,

459
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,480
fucking Mikey language and PD language 
and Tommy Lee.

460
00:20:03,481 --> 00:20:04,314
So let's just agree on the words we use.
How many different new words do you 

461
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:10,530
have?
Boiling down to one,

462
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:13,800
get back to me if you want to call it a 
trans person or a queer person,

463
00:20:13,801 --> 00:20:15,480
you want to call Missouri as everybody 
agreeZ,

464
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,610
,
h e r,

465
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,513
Z,
h e r,

466
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:19,950
that's a new thing.
I don't give a fuck,

467
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:20,813
but don't say I got to go to.
I'll go to jail or you can bring me in 

468
00:20:23,401 --> 00:20:28,110
front of a trial or some tribunals,
some fucking tribal council.

469
00:20:28,111 --> 00:20:28,944
What are you going to do?
You're gonna Bang drums and decide if 

470
00:20:30,301 --> 00:20:33,860
I've uttered the wrong phrase,
but who are these guys to judge also,

471
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:34,713
because Mike didn't tell you,
but one of the judges on that tribunal 

472
00:20:37,231 --> 00:20:38,160
who was saying,
Oh,

473
00:20:38,161 --> 00:20:38,994
you're a piece of shit for making fun of
a kid after that was found to have 

474
00:20:42,181 --> 00:20:43,014
kiddie porn.
He was some kind of child molester and 

475
00:20:44,311 --> 00:20:46,140
he was judging that he was too shitty to
a kid.

476
00:20:46,141 --> 00:20:48,160
There were two people at the Human 
Rights Commission

477
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,270
in Quebec.
The we're.

478
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:52,630
One of them was the president that had 
to resign,

479
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:53,643
that he had paid off a 13 year old girl 
like 15 years ago to not tell anyone 

480
00:20:58,871 --> 00:21:01,420
that he had had sex with her and then 
another one,

481
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:05,170
I think he had had sex with a.
It was a six year old,

482
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,710
like it was fucking crazy,
but these motherfuckers.

483
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:09,960
That's what I hated.
These.

484
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:12,040
These people were telling me,
okay,

485
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:12,874
you're.
You did a joke onstage and that's all 

486
00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:18,370
your intent.
That's what people forget.

487
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,420
Oftentimes in my intent wasn't to hurt 
this little kid.

488
00:21:21,421 --> 00:21:24,550
My intent was to make people laugh,
but these guys,

489
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:28,790
their intent was to put their dick 
inside of a child that's fucking.

490
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:32,080
And they judged him and they judged me 
fucking crazy.

491
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:35,620
While hypocrisy knows no bounds and I 
think,

492
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:38,950
you know,
anybody that's doing anything like that,

493
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:43,600
it's just a sickness that in 
comprehensible these fucking guys,

494
00:21:43,601 --> 00:21:43,900
man.

495
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:44,733
So they put you through some shit.
Like you went through this for a long 

496
00:21:48,131 --> 00:21:49,070
time.
Like my,

497
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:52,150
my lawyer when I first met my lawyer,
I told him,

498
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:52,811
he was like,
look,

499
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:54,910
they want you to settle.
And he goes,

500
00:21:54,911 --> 00:21:55,830
I could,
I could,

501
00:21:55,831 --> 00:21:57,280
um,
get it reduced,

502
00:21:57,281 --> 00:21:58,930
get it reduced.
So like 20 grand.

503
00:21:58,960 --> 00:21:59,800
And I was,
I told them,

504
00:21:59,801 --> 00:22:00,820
I said,
if I do that,

505
00:22:00,821 --> 00:22:01,654
I'm fucking everyone,
like any comic in Canada is going to be 

506
00:22:05,411 --> 00:22:07,270
fucked because I'm going to set this 
weird precedent.

507
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,410
So I told him,
I was like,

508
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:12,610
I'd rather give you 100,000
then give them five.

509
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,170
So then he.
But he told me,

510
00:22:14,171 --> 00:22:15,004
he was like,
we can't win the cause I didn't go to 

511
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:20,800
court.
I went to the human rights tribunal.

512
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:24,580
I was judged by the human rights 
tribunal and the Human Rights Commission

513
00:22:24,581 --> 00:22:28,660
was bringing me there,
so it's me versus them judged by them.

514
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:31,750
So he told me you're definitely going to
lose to kangaroo court,

515
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:34,060
but he said,
he said,

516
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,650
uh,
then will appeal and the government will

517
00:22:36,651 --> 00:22:38,270
probably accept the,
to,

518
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:40,870
to listen to the case again.
And then he goes,

519
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:42,400
then you'll win that.
And,

520
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:43,840
but so I said,
yes.

521
00:22:43,841 --> 00:22:44,621
I was like,
look,

522
00:22:44,621 --> 00:22:46,350
I have to do this.
And I'm out.

523
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:47,510
I,
I,

524
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:50,150
I loved rocky and there was something 
weird about.

525
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:51,940
I was like,
this is fucking rocky.

526
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:56,200
I'm going to be,
I'm going to lose the champ.

527
00:22:56,650 --> 00:22:59,140
So,
so then like I was,

528
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:03,280
something really weird happened to me 
though is I didn't,

529
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:04,293
I didn't think it did affect me this 
much because when I was in court and I 

530
00:23:06,881 --> 00:23:10,060
saw this kid's family fucking crying and
I was like,

531
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:11,140
holy fuck,
okay.

532
00:23:11,141 --> 00:23:14,020
These people really took this shit 
seriously.

533
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,690
And I felt it.
It was weird because my,

534
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:19,030
my joke,
my intent was to make people laugh.

535
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:21,220
And this kid,
I've fucking nothing against this kid.

536
00:23:21,221 --> 00:23:22,360
Like I don't,
I don't,

537
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:25,180
I don't not like them,
I don't know.

538
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:28,860
But then to see that they took this 
seriously and then the,

539
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:31,900
how the media was portraying me,
like uh,

540
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:36,610
the in,
I did a series of shows in Edinburgh and

541
00:23:36,611 --> 00:23:38,530
there's a newspaper,
Montreal,

542
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:39,453
the wrote a Mike Ward,
Mike Ward is getting rich off of this 

543
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:47,480
little boy and I was doing shows in 
Edinburgh that no one makes money.

544
00:23:47,481 --> 00:23:50,690
They're like,
I was playing like a 200 seat theater.

545
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:52,011
And I was like,
oh,

546
00:23:52,011 --> 00:23:56,180
these fuckers are making me look like 
I'm becoming rich because of this little

547
00:23:56,181 --> 00:23:57,410
kid.
You became a target.

548
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:58,753
And then quick bait.
That's how they get people to pay 

549
00:24:00,351 --> 00:24:02,540
attention.
And I didn't think it did affect me.

550
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:04,960
But the thing that I think the reason 
why it did affect,

551
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:08,480
affect me is if all you get is hate,
you can block hate out.

552
00:24:08,481 --> 00:24:12,150
It's super easy to block Keto and,
and if all you get is love,

553
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,890
that's easy too.
But I was getting hate and love so,

554
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,480
so I'd be like,
you know,

555
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:17,323
I wouldn't let the Hayden.
But then someone had shown me love so 

556
00:24:19,131 --> 00:24:19,964
I'd open up and then the hated come in 
and it was just so fucking weird and I 

557
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:27,530
was like googling myself too much.
I'd be like,

558
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:29,690
I'd be like,
Oh fuck,

559
00:24:29,691 --> 00:24:31,420
okay.
There's an article about me in,

560
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:32,323
in Russia,
and then I google translate to see that 

561
00:24:34,371 --> 00:24:35,540
I'm a piece of garbage.

562
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:41,930
It was weird and then I just saw I shows
weren't fun anymore.

563
00:24:41,931 --> 00:24:46,160
So I was doing shows and it people were 
like,

564
00:24:46,161 --> 00:24:48,260
I'd get these weird hecklers.
And I was like,

565
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:49,120
I don't,
I,

566
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:49,953
I didn't like comedy anymore and this is
the only thing I've ever done my whole 

567
00:24:52,131 --> 00:24:53,900
life.
This is the only thing I've ever loved.

568
00:24:54,170 --> 00:24:56,420
Like I don't have kids because of 
comedy,

569
00:24:56,421 --> 00:24:59,780
because I was like,
I know I'm not the type of person.

570
00:24:59,781 --> 00:25:00,614
Like,
like you're good at organizing your 

571
00:25:01,521 --> 00:25:03,410
life.
If I had kids,

572
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:07,400
I like the way I live my life,
I'd be a horrible father.

573
00:25:07,401 --> 00:25:10,220
So I never had kids because of that.
And then I was like,

574
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:11,293
fuck,
the only thing I liked I don't like 

575
00:25:13,101 --> 00:25:15,800
anymore.
And now I don't have kids,

576
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:18,270
which is weird.
But that,

577
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:21,080
yeah,
so I went through this to get out of the

578
00:25:21,081 --> 00:25:21,811
funk,
uh,

579
00:25:21,811 --> 00:25:23,960
took about a year and a half.

580
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:25,820
Wow.
And I told like,

581
00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:27,560
um,
I didn't have,

582
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:32,030
like I make a good living but I'm a 
Canadian comics so I make Canadian comic

583
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:33,420
money like,
so.

584
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:35,870
So I had money,
I had money to pay,

585
00:25:36,050 --> 00:25:38,960
like it's cost me 150 so far in lawyer 
fees.

586
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,850
I,
so far it's ongoing.

587
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:44,890
It's ongoing because now the appeal is,
the appeal is going to be cheap though.

588
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:46,750
It's going to be like only a couple 
thousand but,

589
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:49,130
and I have that.
I had um,

590
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:52,670
I had to Bruce Hills from just for 
laughs that organize the benefit for me.

591
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:54,680
Bruce is the best fucking person on the 
world.

592
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:56,990
He,
he raised about 20.

593
00:25:56,991 --> 00:25:57,850
I had a,
a,

594
00:25:57,910 --> 00:26:02,480
a go fund me the raise 30.
So I paid 100 grand and then I had 50,

595
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:07,100
I had people helping me and that pretty 
much got rid of all my savings.

596
00:26:07,101 --> 00:26:10,670
So I told my manager I didn't like doing
shows anymore.

597
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:14,420
So it was like book me the minimum 
amount of shows that I can,

598
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,310
you know,
I can pay my bills because my,

599
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:17,210
like,
I've,

600
00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:18,440
you know,
my wife doesn't work.

601
00:26:18,441 --> 00:26:22,940
So I was,
he booked me like a week of shows and so

602
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:24,163
three weeks out of the month I was going
through this weird depression one week 

603
00:26:27,051 --> 00:26:30,110
of the month I was doing shows,
pretending like everything was okay.

604
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:31,303
And that took like maybe a year,
a year and a half of me going through 

605
00:26:34,581 --> 00:26:36,290
this really,
really weird,

606
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,720
weird funk.
But the thing that was good,

607
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:39,593
I um,
I don't meditate but I spend my days in 

608
00:26:41,961 --> 00:26:42,794
the bath,
like I just be like lying down in the 

609
00:26:45,301 --> 00:26:47,880
bath,
just staring at the ceiling,

610
00:26:47,881 --> 00:26:48,714
drinking wine.
Like I was drinking wine in my bathtub 

611
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:53,370
all day,
like at least four hours a day.

612
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:54,540
Wow.
And then,

613
00:26:54,541 --> 00:26:56,590
um,
and I could feel like,

614
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:57,713
like what,
you never know when you're in a weird 

615
00:26:59,551 --> 00:27:01,320
funk where the bottom's going to be.

616
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:04,230
But once you start going back up then 
you know,

617
00:27:04,231 --> 00:27:05,400
okay,
I'm getting out of this.

618
00:27:05,401 --> 00:27:08,490
And then when I started feeling better,
like I was like,

619
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:09,510
okay,
I'm feeling better,

620
00:27:09,511 --> 00:27:10,770
a little better,
a little better.

621
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:15,210
And then I'm like six.
I've been out of it like six months ago.

622
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:17,490
I called my manager six months ago and I
was like,

623
00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:19,560
okay,
I'm back a book,

624
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:20,311
this,
this,

625
00:27:20,311 --> 00:27:21,390
this,
I gotta get,

626
00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:24,570
I gotta get some money again.
Well here's the news cycle.

627
00:27:24,571 --> 00:27:26,430
And Canada gone away from it.
Yeah,

628
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,890
definitely helps too.
Yeah,

629
00:27:27,891 --> 00:27:28,620
yeah,
definitely.

630
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:30,220
Like people will find new things.
Yeah.

631
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:34,350
This is a thing like people,
whenever people go after you,

632
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:35,940
you,
it affects you.

633
00:27:35,941 --> 00:27:36,774
And you remember.
And then two weeks later people don't 

634
00:27:38,521 --> 00:27:39,354
even remember.
Even people that I had this woman that 

635
00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:43,643
she had written me on my facebook,
like this 60 year old woman that her 

636
00:27:47,291 --> 00:27:50,370
facebook profile is her with a cat and 
you know,

637
00:27:50,610 --> 00:27:53,340
again,
no clouds and a sweet old lady.

638
00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:54,323
And she'd written a,
I'm happy your mom died because if she 

639
00:27:56,701 --> 00:27:57,910
was still alive,
she,

640
00:27:57,980 --> 00:27:59,460
uh,
she'd kill herself.

641
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:02,400
Seeing what her son has become.
And I was like,

642
00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:03,720
Oh,
you fuck a bitch?

643
00:28:03,721 --> 00:28:05,170
But I started like,
I,

644
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,900
I see.
I go to her page,

645
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:09,620
uh,
I kept on going or a page now and uh,

646
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:10,513
like I'm a better month ago I did an 
interview and she shared it and she was 

647
00:28:13,651 --> 00:28:14,430
like,
oh,

648
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:16,050
like,
like I was a good person again.

649
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,450
I was like this frizzy,
crazy bitch.

650
00:28:18,451 --> 00:28:19,560
Yeah.
Has probably a medication.

651
00:28:19,561 --> 00:28:20,394
Do you remember saying that to you?
And what's even crazier is I keep going 

652
00:28:23,641 --> 00:28:25,580
back to her page.
That's crazy.

653
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:27,270
You're crazy.
It's fucked up.

654
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:29,250
Yeah.
She's on the fucking Roseanne type.

655
00:28:29,251 --> 00:28:30,084
Adderall.
She's probably whacked out of her hand 

656
00:28:32,221 --> 00:28:33,510
or something,
you know,

657
00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:36,090
who knows what she's on.
And alcohol really helped.

658
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:37,200
Like,
I know it's not good,

659
00:28:37,201 --> 00:28:40,130
but alcohol really helped.
And um,

660
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:43,620
so you recommend it,
recommend it if you're.

661
00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:45,290
Because it's a depressant,
but it,

662
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:46,453
it's a number.
It's better to be sad and drunk than 

663
00:28:49,831 --> 00:28:51,540
just said.
Interesting.

664
00:28:51,541 --> 00:28:52,231
Yeah.
And,

665
00:28:52,231 --> 00:28:54,840
but I knew like,
and now I still drank,

666
00:28:54,841 --> 00:28:57,540
but I drank my way less,
way less.

667
00:28:57,541 --> 00:29:02,541
I was drinking,
I was drinking maybe like four,

668
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:06,000
four or five,
maybe six,

669
00:29:06,001 --> 00:29:09,780
26 ounces a week.
Like I was drinking almost a full bottle

670
00:29:09,781 --> 00:29:12,180
of vodka every day.
That would be impressive.

671
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,193
But yesterday jake,
the snake was on 80 mile drive with 

672
00:29:16,411 --> 00:29:18,780
Andre the giant,
I think 48 beers.

673
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:19,943
Yeah.
No,

674
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:23,480
that's fucking crazy.
And he didn't already eight peers.

675
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,320
So yeah.
No,

676
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:26,580
no,
I was not a wine though,

677
00:29:26,581 --> 00:29:27,201
man.
Yeah.

678
00:29:27,201 --> 00:29:31,200
And the fact that you just sit in the 
tub and just in your diabetic.

679
00:29:31,201 --> 00:29:31,500
Right?

680
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:33,270
I'm diabetic.
You're not supposed to be drinking wine,

681
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:34,130
are you?
Oh,

682
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,990
there aren't that many carbs in wine,
like not that much sugar.

683
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:39,000
Not that much.
But you're drinking it all day.

684
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:42,040
She'll catch up now,
but that's why I switched to vodka.

685
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:45,250
Good mood.
Don't stop thinking about my health.

686
00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:48,700
Getting organic.
Just make sure it's organic.

687
00:29:48,701 --> 00:29:49,900
You'll be fun.
Exactly.

688
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:50,870
Yeah.
So,

689
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:51,703
um,
do they give you a time where you have 

690
00:29:53,861 --> 00:29:56,440
to finish this thing or where it's going
to be settled by?

691
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:58,180
I just got.
This was many years ago,

692
00:29:58,181 --> 00:29:59,450
right?
What year did it start this?

693
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:04,670
This is a joke.
I wrote in 2009 and I did in a special.

694
00:30:04,841 --> 00:30:08,170
That was from 2010.
I did a tour 2000,

695
00:30:08,171 --> 00:30:09,004
10 to 2012,
so this is a super old joke and what's 

696
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:16,390
fucked up defending something that you 
wrote 10 years ago,

697
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:17,453
like people were like,
what were you thinking when you wrote 

698
00:30:18,971 --> 00:30:19,630
that joke?

699
00:30:19,630 --> 00:30:21,280
And I'm like,
I don't know what the fuck.

700
00:30:21,281 --> 00:30:24,340
I was thinking not even year.
And some one guy told me,

701
00:30:24,370 --> 00:30:25,300
he was like,
you know,

702
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,870
you can't say things like that anymore 
nowadays.

703
00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:28,720
And I was like,
oh,

704
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,790
I know.
I wrote that joke 10 years ago.

705
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:33,340
Ten years ago.
We used to do say shit.

706
00:30:33,341 --> 00:30:36,410
That was way fucking meter than that.
Yeah,

707
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:39,120
there's some funny dark jokes,
you know,

708
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:41,790
I always bring up is Brian Holzman bit 
that he did right after.

709
00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:44,320
I remember that Susan Smith Lady that 
drowned her kids.

710
00:30:44,321 --> 00:30:45,310
Do you remember?
Yeah.

711
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:46,373
Crazy shit.
They found this lady drove her car into 

712
00:30:49,091 --> 00:30:49,924
the river and just drowned her kids did 
it on purpose and a right after it 

713
00:30:54,791 --> 00:30:56,090
happened.
Brian holds,

714
00:30:56,091 --> 00:30:57,640
but it goes onstage.
The comedy story goes.

715
00:30:57,970 --> 00:31:00,610
Ladies and gentlemen,
I heard those are bad kids.

716
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:04,540
They sat that close to the TV.
They never put away their blocks,

717
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:05,493
the constantly spilling the milk.
Those kids will not be missed and 

718
00:31:09,071 --> 00:31:10,930
everybody was like,
Oh shit.

719
00:31:10,931 --> 00:31:14,680
It was so ridiculously mean and funny at
the same time,

720
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:18,280
and people have to understand that 
that's you're in a nightclub.

721
00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:21,580
People are drinking,
you are allowed freedom of expression.

722
00:31:21,581 --> 00:31:23,680
It is fun.
These aren't bad people.

723
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:25,860
Holtz was not a bad person.
You're not a bad person,

724
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:26,823
bad people.
These are people that are doing a 

725
00:31:28,091 --> 00:31:30,190
certain type of art form and here's 
what's weird,

726
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,473
this type of art form,
when you do you say mean shit that you 

727
00:31:33,671 --> 00:31:34,504
don't really mean for whatever reason 
you can't do that because you're a guy 

728
00:31:37,601 --> 00:31:39,820
on stage and it's too much like you're 
actually saying it,

729
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:43,180
but if you were saying it in a movie,
if you're planning a fine,

730
00:31:43,181 --> 00:31:44,014
be fine.
You're playing a mean fucking villain 

731
00:31:45,821 --> 00:31:49,090
characters saying awful shit in a movie.
Everybody would be like,

732
00:31:49,091 --> 00:31:50,770
yeah,
Sam Jackson is a great guy.

733
00:31:50,890 --> 00:31:53,880
He didn't really kill that guy over the 
cheeseburger like that.

734
00:31:53,970 --> 00:31:55,810
That was just a.
his character did that.

735
00:31:55,870 --> 00:31:57,460
He's a murderous monster,
right?

736
00:31:57,461 --> 00:31:58,294
He's screaming Bible Vengeance,
Bible verses and then fucking shooting 

737
00:32:01,931 --> 00:32:02,764
this dude,
but nobody has a problem with that 

738
00:32:03,821 --> 00:32:07,930
because it's Samuel Jackson's obviously 
an actor in pulp fiction was a movie.

739
00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:09,160
We don't have any confusion.

740
00:32:09,670 --> 00:32:11,140
Santa file.
Yeah.

741
00:32:11,141 --> 00:32:12,060
Yeah.
And then movie.

742
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:12,551
Yeah,
yeah,

743
00:32:12,551 --> 00:32:14,410
yeah.
There's something that's fucked up about

744
00:32:14,411 --> 00:32:17,420
Canada though.
There's a makeup artist named him.

745
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,570
He quits.
He's a Sudep five times.

746
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:23,270
That's like the GSP of makeup artist.
But he,

747
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,273
yeah,
he's special effects makeup and he did 

748
00:32:27,641 --> 00:32:29,340
this movie,
sort of like a,

749
00:32:29,410 --> 00:32:32,590
just a,
like a demo of what he can do.

750
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:36,820
It was a short film where he had this 
little kid and he murdered the kid.

751
00:32:36,821 --> 00:32:39,230
He didn't actually murder the kid and 
uh,

752
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:42,860
and then he put that out on the Internet
with,

753
00:32:42,950 --> 00:32:43,783
you know,
his name at the end and the whole who 

754
00:32:45,441 --> 00:32:50,441
played who and some fucking Weirdo in 
Germany saw this and thought it was real

755
00:32:50,781 --> 00:32:51,950
cold.
Interpol,

756
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:52,993
Interpol called the Montreal cops.
Montreal police went to remain 

757
00:32:56,330 --> 00:32:58,670
[inaudible] house to arrest him for 
murder.

758
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,740
And then he said no,
but the kid,

759
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:02,030
they were like,
we saw the video.

760
00:33:02,210 --> 00:33:02,661
And he goes,
yeah,

761
00:33:02,661 --> 00:33:06,170
but the kid see the kid in the video,
he's my neighbor.

762
00:33:06,171 --> 00:33:09,050
So they went to meet the,
the murder victim,

763
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:13,520
which was a little kid neighbor and they
saw he was alive and they still,

764
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:14,383
they took,
they took them to court because they 

765
00:33:16,011 --> 00:33:16,844
said what he did incited violence and,
and he and everyone told them they were 

766
00:33:22,161 --> 00:33:22,994
like,
you're gonna win for sure because this 

767
00:33:23,991 --> 00:33:24,824
is just stupid.
But the thing is he had to defend 

768
00:33:26,661 --> 00:33:29,260
himself.
He had to go to court and he had to.

769
00:33:29,330 --> 00:33:32,750
And when you win a court case like that,
like if it costs you 30,

770
00:33:32,751 --> 00:33:33,770
50,
80,000

771
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:34,673
to defend yourself,
the government doesn't give you your 

772
00:33:36,561 --> 00:33:39,020
money back.
And that's a stupid like my case,

773
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:40,790
I find it,
it's Kinda stupid.

774
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:45,860
But his case is fucking retarded because
no one ever kills someone.

775
00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:49,130
Films it.
And then has the end credits.

776
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,033
Yeah,
no.

777
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:51,180
Well,
if they did,

778
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:54,250
now they'll do it.
Because you said no one ever does that.

779
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:56,940
I would like to point you to a podcast 
with Mike Ward.

780
00:33:57,020 --> 00:34:00,780
We clearly showed some fucking psycho 
set established.

781
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:02,250
He's like,
challenge accepted.

782
00:34:02,490 --> 00:34:07,140
This is why Jordan Peterson was so 
adamant that that bill was dangerous and

783
00:34:07,141 --> 00:34:09,750
that it would be bad for everybody in 
bad for free speech.

784
00:34:09,751 --> 00:34:10,584
When we look at it in America,
I think we have a distorted perception 

785
00:34:12,751 --> 00:34:13,584
because I don't think we totally 
understand your system of government 

786
00:34:15,931 --> 00:34:16,764
when it comes to censorship because you 
guys don't have freedom of expression 

787
00:34:19,801 --> 00:34:20,670
the way we do in America.

788
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:21,533
What's fucked up too about being 
Canadian is since all of our TV and all 

789
00:34:24,451 --> 00:34:27,780
of our movies are American,
like the first thing I asked my lawyer,

790
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:28,590
I was like,
what about?

791
00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:30,420
What about the First Amendment?
He was like,

792
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:31,141
yeah,
we don't.

793
00:34:31,141 --> 00:34:32,940
We don't have it.
I was like,

794
00:34:32,941 --> 00:34:33,741
no,
I know we don't.

795
00:34:33,741 --> 00:34:37,930
I know we're not America,
but we must have the Canadian version of

796
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:38,730
that,
and he was like,

797
00:34:38,730 --> 00:34:39,640
no,
there's no like,

798
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:43,410
like people all over the world that talk
shit about the states.

799
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:48,240
The states is the only place in the 
world that speech is protected by law.

800
00:34:48,730 --> 00:34:51,360
You can still get in trouble by saying 
shit.

801
00:34:51,361 --> 00:34:52,020
You can still get it.

802
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:52,853
Protests.
Did you see Michelle Wolf Donk on the 

803
00:34:54,211 --> 00:34:55,890
president today?
No.

804
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:57,810
She dunked on trump.
Dude.

805
00:34:58,890 --> 00:35:03,890
Donald trump talk shit about her saying 
that she bombed so hard last year at the

806
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:05,880
White House press correspondents' 
dinner,

807
00:35:05,910 --> 00:35:06,743
which unfortunately for him we've all 
seen the video and she didn't bother at 

808
00:35:11,161 --> 00:35:13,020
all.
In fact she killed.

809
00:35:13,021 --> 00:35:16,950
She had some funny shit and so he wrote 
today that she bumped so hard.

810
00:35:16,951 --> 00:35:19,560
They're now going to bring someone like 
they're not going to do comedy anymore.

811
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,060
They're going to bring in an author.
Here it is.

812
00:35:21,450 --> 00:35:22,283
Yeah.
So called comedian Michelle was bombed 

813
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:29,130
so badly as you're in the White House 
correspondence dinner that this year for

814
00:35:29,131 --> 00:35:31,650
the first time in decades they will have
an author instead of a comedian.

815
00:35:31,651 --> 00:35:34,830
Good first step to come back with dying 
evening and tradition.

816
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:36,090
Exclamation point.
Maybe.

817
00:35:36,091 --> 00:35:38,160
I will go question.
She writes.

818
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:41,190
I bet you'd be on my side if I had 
killed a journalist.

819
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:43,770
Hashtag best.
That's good.

820
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:49,880
We'll get.
She's got 297,769

821
00:35:50,251 --> 00:35:52,380
likes.
Sixty 4,000.

822
00:35:52,381 --> 00:35:54,810
One hundred 69 retweets.
One of which is mine.

823
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:58,200
That was brutal.
That shit is hilarious.

824
00:35:58,201 --> 00:36:00,690
She's,
she's a savage and he's.

825
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,250
That's silly.
What he did was silly.

826
00:36:02,251 --> 00:36:04,210
You can't say someone bought,
but he does.

827
00:36:04,211 --> 00:36:05,330
I mean that's his move,
right?

828
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:06,413
It doesn't have to be real,
but you shouldn't say someone bombed 

829
00:36:08,911 --> 00:36:10,860
when we can watch the fact that it 
didn't bomb.

830
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:14,070
You pull it up at anytime you want and 
you could watch that video.

831
00:36:14,071 --> 00:36:15,480
She killed him.
Say that though,

832
00:36:15,481 --> 00:36:18,180
because since the people that have seen 
it,

833
00:36:18,181 --> 00:36:19,200
no,
she didn't bump,

834
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:21,500
but the people that didn't see it,
now they think,

835
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:24,360
I don't think it matters.
I think in the mag a mindset.

836
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:25,360
Okay.
If you had a mag,

837
00:36:25,361 --> 00:36:26,194
a mindset,
it would be you don't need any reality 

838
00:36:29,071 --> 00:36:29,904
other than the reality that you all 
decided upon and you press forward with 

839
00:36:32,941 --> 00:36:33,774
fucking hashtags and American flags and 
red and white hats and you just keep 

840
00:36:37,261 --> 00:36:38,040
moving.

841
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:38,873
You just keep moving and eventually what
you're doing is you're like hacking the 

842
00:36:41,971 --> 00:36:46,050
news cycle because the news cycle is 
just so everything lasts a day.

843
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:48,150
Maybe two days,
four days sick.

844
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,820
No,
he's a fuck about stormy daniels.

845
00:36:49,821 --> 00:36:51,780
Stop talking about it.
It's over,

846
00:36:51,930 --> 00:36:53,330
like that's what's going on.
I mean that's.

847
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:54,393
And they've kind of figured that out and
sort of an odd way like even him with 

848
00:36:58,031 --> 00:36:58,900
the stormy Daniels.
Thank you.

849
00:36:58,910 --> 00:37:00,630
Still talk about it.
It'll go away.

850
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:02,640
It's going away.
Not only that,

851
00:37:02,641 --> 00:37:06,900
like the fucking lawyer now he got 
charged with domestic violence.

852
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:07,883
The lawyer for stone stormy day.
The guy who was going to run for 

853
00:37:10,321 --> 00:37:11,154
president now he got charged with 
domestic violence and check out a 

854
00:37:13,351 --> 00:37:15,210
restraining order.
It's over baby.

855
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:18,960
So like you just keep moving.
All they do is just keep moving,

856
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:21,510
just keep moving and eventually go like 
this,

857
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:23,940
like yeah,
obviously she didn't bomb.

858
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:27,000
He can say she did and even she'd done 
because them keep moving,

859
00:37:27,270 --> 00:37:28,103
just keep moving.
It doesn't do nothing ever sticks 

860
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:33,440
because he's caught a wave.
Like there's the new cycles.

861
00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:34,830
So crazy.
Everything's so crazy.

862
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:38,640
There's nothing stationary that we call 
can examine for long periods of time.

863
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:41,550
Everything's just moving.
Everything's just constantly moving.

864
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:45,540
There's no stability.
It's k with him in the White House.

865
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:49,760
He knows there's no stability because he
actually got to be the president.

866
00:37:49,761 --> 00:37:50,594
Yeah,
he figured like he treats everyone like 

867
00:37:53,071 --> 00:37:55,410
a comic treats hecklers.
Yes.

868
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:58,290
And he's said,
and people that say that he still,

869
00:37:58,350 --> 00:37:59,490
he's,
he's so smart,

870
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:00,353
like he figured he figured all this shit
figured out that all the protocol that 

871
00:38:03,481 --> 00:38:05,460
was established in the fucking 18 
hundreds,

872
00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:07,590
early $19.
It doesn't mean anything anymore.

873
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:09,810
You know,
this is not Harry Truman.

874
00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:12,330
This is,
this is not George Washington.

875
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,340
This is 2018.

876
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,680
There's porn everywhere.
Okay.

877
00:38:16,681 --> 00:38:19,440
Oxycontin's are killing people and no 
one's talking about it.

878
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:20,393
Cigarettes are killing people.
No politician ever brings up the fact 

879
00:38:22,591 --> 00:38:24,570
half a million people die every year in 
this country.

880
00:38:24,571 --> 00:38:26,370
Just from cigarettes.
Shut the fuck up,

881
00:38:26,371 --> 00:38:27,840
keep moving.
And then,

882
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:28,833
you know,
he said he had that little jeff 

883
00:38:29,461 --> 00:38:30,294
sessions,
little munchkin working for him forever 

884
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,970
with saying that good people don't smoke
marijuana like the whole thing.

885
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:35,973
Chaos.
He's knows it's chaos because he's the 

886
00:38:37,511 --> 00:38:38,344
top guy.
You imagine being the top guy in 

887
00:38:41,031 --> 00:38:41,864
something as insane as like the United 
States governmental system and seeing 

888
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:45,953
the lobbyists and special interest 
groups and all the money and all the 

889
00:38:48,491 --> 00:38:49,324
fucking cast and Saudi Arabia's cutting 
up journalists and you gotta keep your 

890
00:38:52,001 --> 00:38:54,160
mouth shut.
It's fucking madness.

891
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:57,850
And he's the top madman.
No wonder why he tweets shit like this.

892
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,450
He knows there's no rules so crazy.
It could all fall apart at any minute.

893
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:03,850
It's so fucking wacky.
I was watching today.

894
00:39:03,851 --> 00:39:04,684
Him pardoning a Turkey.
I don't know why you guys still do this 

895
00:39:06,101 --> 00:39:06,934
kind of crazy shit.
But he was probably tweeting about Jim 

896
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:11,710
Acosta being a fag and then turns around
and goes,

897
00:39:11,711 --> 00:39:13,000
this Turkey,
good Turkey.

898
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:14,590
He came here illegally.
Let them.

899
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:17,050
It's so stupid.
What did he do with that Turkey?

900
00:39:17,051 --> 00:39:17,884
He,
um,

901
00:39:17,890 --> 00:39:19,360
he just,
he just decided to.

902
00:39:19,361 --> 00:39:21,350
Turkey gets to live.
Yeah.

903
00:39:21,370 --> 00:39:26,080
What happens to those immediately when 
they shut the cameras off for sure.

904
00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:30,070
I'm not telling you you're going to eat 
you for Christmas.

905
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:32,500
So the whole idea that that would be a 
thing.

906
00:39:32,501 --> 00:39:35,110
It's so fucking stupid.
We're going to decide one Turkey,

907
00:39:35,410 --> 00:39:37,090
one turkeys are good Turkey.
Yeah,

908
00:39:37,091 --> 00:39:38,260
and everyone's like,
save it.

909
00:39:38,290 --> 00:39:39,123
Save it.
Nope.

910
00:39:39,130 --> 00:39:40,480
Out with the ax.
Psych.

911
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:43,210
I was just kidding.
Put his head on a log chunk.

912
00:39:43,270 --> 00:39:44,140
People would freak out.

913
00:39:44,290 --> 00:39:46,060
But you knew I was going to kill a 
Turkey.

914
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:48,220
Why were you upset that I'm killing this
Turkey?

915
00:39:48,221 --> 00:39:49,630
Yeah,
but it's all in St Louis.

916
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:51,310
Yesterday he tweeted,
he said some,

917
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:52,433
uh,
I believe Saudi Arabia may have been 

918
00:39:53,621 --> 00:39:54,990
behind that Kosha.
Shaggy.

919
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:55,840
Murdered.
Like,

920
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:58,090
did you just figure that out?
What is he a detective?

921
00:39:58,340 --> 00:40:00,040
It took this long.
Everybody knew.

922
00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:01,600
Well,
okay,

923
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:03,610
let's examine that.
You stay.

924
00:40:03,611 --> 00:40:04,720
Everybody knew,
right?

925
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:06,460
Yeah.
How much do you really know?

926
00:40:07,570 --> 00:40:08,950
Only what?
Turkey to told us.

927
00:40:09,130 --> 00:40:10,950
Only what the.
Everybody tells you.

928
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:11,953
I'm not,
I'm not saying I'm not advocating 

929
00:40:13,481 --> 00:40:14,314
conspiracy theories,
but anyone who says they know what 

930
00:40:15,761 --> 00:40:17,350
happened.
Like Jesus,

931
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:20,500
the only people that know what happened 
or the people that did it,

932
00:40:20,830 --> 00:40:21,663
and then the people who think they know 
what happened to the people that are 

933
00:40:23,441 --> 00:40:26,230
examining it and then the people that 
are reading third,

934
00:40:26,231 --> 00:40:26,891
fourth,
fifth,

935
00:40:26,891 --> 00:40:29,350
sixth hand about what happened.

936
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:31,900
We're just talking shit,
you know.

937
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:32,763
Oh,
they killed him.

938
00:40:33,190 --> 00:40:34,330
Are you sure?
Okay.

939
00:40:34,331 --> 00:40:37,690
I'm sure this is what I'm sure.
I'm sure that if you stare at the sun,

940
00:40:37,691 --> 00:40:38,930
it burns your eyes.
Right.

941
00:40:39,130 --> 00:40:40,020
I tried it.
I've,

942
00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:43,270
a lot of people have done it.
I'm sure you know.

943
00:40:43,271 --> 00:40:46,870
I'm sure that if you a light dead trees 
up on fire,

944
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,160
they,
it becomes a wildfire.

945
00:40:48,161 --> 00:40:49,750
It's very dangerous.
I'm sure of that.

946
00:40:49,870 --> 00:40:52,180
That's real.
Who killed that guy?

947
00:40:52,370 --> 00:40:54,790
I'm,
I'm sure someone killed them.

948
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:58,450
They're all admitting they killed them.
Pretty sure that pretty sure.

949
00:40:58,810 --> 00:40:59,920
Pretty sure.
I don't really know.

950
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:03,130
Right?
Because one day saying that they had,

951
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:04,503
the Turkish government had recordings,
but they didn't want to share them 

952
00:41:07,361 --> 00:41:08,194
publicly because they didn't want the 
other embassies knowing how they record 

953
00:41:10,391 --> 00:41:11,500
embassies because you're not supposed 
to.

954
00:41:11,650 --> 00:41:13,480
Exactly.
So that's what they said.

955
00:41:13,730 --> 00:41:16,030
If you're not supposed to,
but I think they probably all do it.

956
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:16,870
Yeah.
Yeah,

957
00:41:16,870 --> 00:41:17,471
definitely.
Well,

958
00:41:17,471 --> 00:41:20,320
apparently there's video and audio is 
what I read,

959
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:22,120
but I don't know if that's true.
Fuck.

960
00:41:22,121 --> 00:41:24,070
Do I know when you want to say,
oh,

961
00:41:24,071 --> 00:41:25,450
they killed them.
They fucking killed him.

962
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:27,580
Said that he,
there is an audio tape,

963
00:41:27,581 --> 00:41:29,800
but he wasn't going to hear it because 
he didn't want to hear it.

964
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:31,180
It was totally.
Didn't need to.

965
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:32,741
Yeah.
You know what,

966
00:41:32,741 --> 00:41:33,950
man,
that brings me back to that movie.

967
00:41:33,951 --> 00:41:34,310
Grizzly

968
00:41:34,310 --> 00:41:36,290
man,
remember grizzly man,

969
00:41:36,291 --> 00:41:39,650
they had audio.
The guy got eaten by a grizzly bear,

970
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:40,513
lived with Chrissy bills forever.
Everybody's like is going to get eaten 

971
00:41:42,850 --> 00:41:45,190
and then one day gets heat and along the
way,

972
00:41:45,530 --> 00:41:48,170
have you ever seen the documentary?
It's a Warner Herzog movie.

973
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:50,720
It's one of the greatest unintentional 
comedy of all time.

974
00:41:51,110 --> 00:41:53,870
It's really good what?
Get Lit and watch it.

975
00:41:53,871 --> 00:41:56,540
You're going to fucking love it.
It's a guy who is.

976
00:41:57,320 --> 00:42:00,430
There's something wrong with him and 
right away like you,

977
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:02,030
you start making judgments.
Like,

978
00:42:02,031 --> 00:42:03,350
is he gang?
I think he's gay.

979
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:07,700
I think he's gay and he fighting it and 
one of the ways he fights it,

980
00:42:07,701 --> 00:42:10,010
he goes and lives in the forest.
I'm not bullshitting.

981
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:14,060
He didn't get the term bears.
No,

982
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:15,013
he's saving bears,
but he's like so feminine and he brings 

983
00:42:17,421 --> 00:42:19,670
his fucking camera and he's walking 
through the forest.

984
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:20,960
He goes,
I wish I was just gay,

985
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:25,310
but I'm not gay.
If I was gay then I would just go meet a

986
00:42:25,311 --> 00:42:27,800
guy at a truck stop or something,
but I'm not gay.

987
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:28,753
So it's like who?
Who are walking around by themselves in 

988
00:42:35,511 --> 00:42:37,770
the woods surrounded by bears going,
wow,

989
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:40,160
files just gay or be so easy,
like,

990
00:42:40,161 --> 00:42:43,760
do you hear how you're saying it?
Like the stereotypical gay voices.

991
00:42:43,761 --> 00:42:44,594
One of the weirdest things because 
there's like not a single masculine 

992
00:42:48,561 --> 00:42:51,680
heterosexual male who uses that speech 
pattern.

993
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:55,250
Like that speech pattern.
It's exclusive to gay men.

994
00:42:55,620 --> 00:42:57,640
Like I'm not gay,
whatever.

995
00:42:57,710 --> 00:42:59,030
Here we go.
I was like,

996
00:42:59,031 --> 00:43:03,770
this is a speech pattern that we 
associate with homosexuals and you know,

997
00:43:03,771 --> 00:43:05,330
you could say someone's prejudice,
but you look,

998
00:43:05,331 --> 00:43:07,460
you know it's true.
That's true.

999
00:43:07,610 --> 00:43:08,443
You know,
you hear someone talking and saying 

1000
00:43:10,521 --> 00:43:12,890
homosexual type things in that voice you
have.

1001
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:13,753
It sounds like a gay guy.

1002
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:17,090
Have you ever had.
I had a friend come out of the closet to

1003
00:43:17,091 --> 00:43:19,400
me and the whole time he was coming out 
I was like,

1004
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:20,473
Oh shit,
I'm going to have to pretend like I'm 

1005
00:43:21,411 --> 00:43:24,260
surprised because he was like,
look,

1006
00:43:24,261 --> 00:43:25,440
I got a Ta.
And I was like,

1007
00:43:25,780 --> 00:43:26,613
Oh fuck.

1008
00:43:29,770 --> 00:43:31,330
It's weird.
It is weird.

1009
00:43:31,331 --> 00:43:31,991
Yeah.
Well,

1010
00:43:31,991 --> 00:43:35,650
you know what it's weird is any 
discussion of it is deemed homophobic.

1011
00:43:35,670 --> 00:43:38,650
It's not homophobic at all.
No problem with me being gay,

1012
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:43,480
but it is weird that some percentage,
whether it's 10 percent,

1013
00:43:43,510 --> 00:43:44,343
20 percent,
whatever the number is of gay guys talk 

1014
00:43:46,871 --> 00:43:48,790
gay.
They're adorable.

1015
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:50,430
You know,
they say gay things.

1016
00:43:50,710 --> 00:43:53,270
They have their fingers.
Justin Martin deals.

1017
00:43:53,290 --> 00:43:54,580
Good friend of mine.
Gaze.

1018
00:43:54,581 --> 00:43:56,830
Fuck loves it.
Swings.

1019
00:43:57,310 --> 00:44:00,460
He swings when he walks he sachets as he
walks into a room.

1020
00:44:00,790 --> 00:44:02,620
He's hilarious too.
Fucking funny.

1021
00:44:02,621 --> 00:44:04,480
Standup comic.
But he's,

1022
00:44:04,510 --> 00:44:05,343
he,
you know,

1023
00:44:05,470 --> 00:44:10,330
he will take on those kind of vocal 
affectations,

1024
00:44:10,331 --> 00:44:11,740
you know,
not negative.

1025
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:12,653
There's a comic of Montreal.
He's a good friend named John Sanka 

1026
00:44:15,150 --> 00:44:16,170
Dart.
He's a gay guy,

1027
00:44:16,171 --> 00:44:19,890
but a gay audiences don't like him 
because he's a guy guy.

1028
00:44:19,891 --> 00:44:23,670
Like he's from a small town in Manitoba 
or whatever.

1029
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:27,180
So gay people don't like him cause he,
cause he's,

1030
00:44:27,210 --> 00:44:30,930
he's a guy guy and then we were talking 
last summer and I was like,

1031
00:44:31,050 --> 00:44:32,040
you should do a show and

1032
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:32,873
call it no gays allowed because whenever
he has gay people it always goes wrong 

1033
00:44:36,730 --> 00:44:38,850
because they get angry and that's so 
weird.

1034
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:40,950
He's a guy guy but he's gay and they get
mad.

1035
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:44,610
But here's what's funny,
if he was a guy guy but he was straight,

1036
00:44:44,611 --> 00:44:46,170
they'd probably want to turn him.
Yeah,

1037
00:44:48,340 --> 00:44:51,830
he should pretend to be a straight guy 
that's like really easy to turn.

1038
00:44:51,970 --> 00:44:55,740
A buddy of mine who was a makeup artist,
super good dude who's gay as fuck.

1039
00:44:55,741 --> 00:44:56,970
And he was always telling me about 
these.

1040
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:58,073
He would do airtech street guys that 
would suck his dick straight of him 

1041
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:05,460
suck.
They're laughing.

1042
00:45:05,461 --> 00:45:06,600
I was like,
ah.

1043
00:45:06,810 --> 00:45:07,643
He,
he would give me details like what is 

1044
00:45:09,901 --> 00:45:11,400
going on?
What's going on?

1045
00:45:11,610 --> 00:45:14,100
They like it.
They get a thrill out of turning guys,

1046
00:45:14,610 --> 00:45:16,050
but I don't think they're turning 
anybody.

1047
00:45:16,350 --> 00:45:19,470
I had a friend that used to,
when I first moved to Montreal,

1048
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:20,513
we he'd be like,
let's go to a gay bar because a lot of 

1049
00:45:22,531 --> 00:45:24,510
women go there because they don't want 
to get hit on,

1050
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:25,493
and then he was like,
we'll just pretend like we're gay and 

1051
00:45:27,511 --> 00:45:30,600
we'll try to have sex with the lady for 
the first time.

1052
00:45:31,550 --> 00:45:34,350
He was really good at it because he was 
like super thin,

1053
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:38,640
so he did look like a gay guy,
but I just looked like a fucking weird,

1054
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:42,660
weird fucking Chubby,
straight guy going into a gay bar.

1055
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:43,733
Like fuck gay guys built like you.
But I'm always surprised whenever I see 

1056
00:45:47,521 --> 00:45:49,850
chubby gay guys.
I don't believe.

1057
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:52,350
I don't believe they're really gay 
because I'm like,

1058
00:45:52,990 --> 00:45:54,390
okay,
I'm a dude.

1059
00:45:54,450 --> 00:45:56,790
I wouldn't fuck someone shaped like 
that.

1060
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:57,900
Hm.
Interesting.

1061
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:01,500
Yeah.
Maybe A.

1062
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:03,900
Maybe they just have different genes.
I see it differently.

1063
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:04,793
I don't know.
Something about them as attracted to 

1064
00:46:05,821 --> 00:46:09,060
someone who has got a lot of natural 
resources stored in the skin.

1065
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:11,970
You know what?
If it gets really cold out,

1066
00:46:12,530 --> 00:46:14,670
stay alive.
He could keep me warm.

1067
00:46:14,671 --> 00:46:16,200
He'll protect me.
Keep fucking me.

1068
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:19,160
Hang onto him.
Oh,

1069
00:46:19,570 --> 00:46:20,403
did you?
I don't know if you're doing an archery 

1070
00:46:21,821 --> 00:46:23,890
today,
but did you see that tribe this morning?

1071
00:46:23,891 --> 00:46:26,400
I saw a video we're talking about right 
before the podcast,

1072
00:46:26,401 --> 00:46:27,234
but the guy in India who's trying to 
convert them apparently January San and 

1073
00:46:31,031 --> 00:46:31,864
they shot him full of arrows with the 
one of the last uncontacted tribes in 

1074
00:46:35,051 --> 00:46:36,580
the world.
But what a doofus.

1075
00:46:36,581 --> 00:46:37,900
What'd you think was gonna Happen?
Right?

1076
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:39,640
Jamie said the guy's been there before.
Right?

1077
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:40,990
Did you say that?
So they knew him.

1078
00:46:41,410 --> 00:46:42,171
The other guy.
Well,

1079
00:46:42,171 --> 00:46:43,004
I don't know.
The people that killed them knew them 

1080
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:47,200
when they say there's between 50 and 100
people on this island,

1081
00:46:47,201 --> 00:46:49,120
I believe.
See if we can get a good article on it.

1082
00:46:49,510 --> 00:46:50,850
Set the number of trying to pull up on 
our book.

1083
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:54,580
So those are like 50 or 50 to 150 
people.

1084
00:46:54,581 --> 00:46:55,870
They don't exactly know.

1085
00:46:55,950 --> 00:46:57,490
Um,
and they,

1086
00:46:57,550 --> 00:47:02,020
they came there just say from it's the 
size of Manhattan.

1087
00:47:02,021 --> 00:47:05,110
So the island and they came here from 
Africa,

1088
00:47:05,111 --> 00:47:07,490
like what is it?
Sixty thousand years ago I'd read them.

1089
00:47:07,690 --> 00:47:10,540
I don't remember exactly where I.
The article earlier.

1090
00:47:10,541 --> 00:47:11,550
India?
Yeah.

1091
00:47:11,610 --> 00:47:12,443
Yeah.
Someone in India or near near near 

1092
00:47:14,111 --> 00:47:14,944
India.
So island fucking dude was trying to 

1093
00:47:17,381 --> 00:47:21,700
bring them to Jesus and they said if you
liked the guy will introduce it to them.

1094
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:24,580
They filled up motherfucker full.
Oh Wow.

1095
00:47:24,581 --> 00:47:25,900
It's in the middle of nowhere.
All that.

1096
00:47:25,990 --> 00:47:27,700
Fuck.
That bitch is in the middle of nowhere.

1097
00:47:27,701 --> 00:47:31,570
So they came off of Africa.
That's crazy.

1098
00:47:32,650 --> 00:47:36,730
How the fuck you see all that shit.
That's crazy.

1099
00:47:37,060 --> 00:47:39,550
Yeah.
You know what's interesting too,

1100
00:47:39,551 --> 00:47:42,280
in England they call uh,
people from India,

1101
00:47:42,430 --> 00:47:43,263
Asians,
they think of that as Asia because it 

1102
00:47:45,581 --> 00:47:46,414
is.
But we got weird with oriental at some 

1103
00:47:49,271 --> 00:47:52,870
point in time.
Oriental became derogatory,

1104
00:47:53,020 --> 00:47:53,853
some weird way.

1105
00:47:54,140 --> 00:47:54,973
Oriana was normal like oriental rugs.
That was like a thing you'd go to 

1106
00:47:57,701 --> 00:47:58,850
oriental rugs.
Yeah.

1107
00:47:58,910 --> 00:48:00,550
That's like if someone was saying,
you know,

1108
00:48:00,940 --> 00:48:01,840
toothpaste,
like,

1109
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:03,670
hey,
hey motherfucker,

1110
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:04,593
you can't say that shit anymore.
But at one point in time oriental was 

1111
00:48:07,061 --> 00:48:09,100
like a total.
This is a real thing.

1112
00:48:09,101 --> 00:48:10,360
Yeah.
It was part of the language.

1113
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:11,633
Um,
but so now we say Asian because we try 

1114
00:48:13,901 --> 00:48:17,770
to be politically correct,
but Asia is fucking giant.

1115
00:48:18,070 --> 00:48:20,350
There's a lot of different kinds of 
folks in Asia.

1116
00:48:20,830 --> 00:48:21,663
You know,
what,

1117
00:48:21,670 --> 00:48:22,390
what,
what those,

1118
00:48:22,390 --> 00:48:25,420
like the people that ended up on that 
island one dude,

1119
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:29,080
they,
how the fuck do you,

1120
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:31,720
you're running away from something to 
end up.

1121
00:48:31,750 --> 00:48:33,460
Well everybody's,
that's,

1122
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:34,313
you know,
if you read about the migration of 

1123
00:48:36,701 --> 00:48:37,534
people from Africa spreading out,
that's a big part of what they're doing 

1124
00:48:40,510 --> 00:48:42,520
is trying to get away from people that 
are trying to tell them,

1125
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:43,533
yeah,
it's all either they run out of 

1126
00:48:45,310 --> 00:48:47,950
resources,
they're run a food or they're being,

1127
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:51,430
they're being forced out of areas like 
new people come in,

1128
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:55,660
people escape and survive and did our 
entire history as human beings.

1129
00:48:55,660 --> 00:48:56,493
It's like bigger,
more powerful human beings move into an 

1130
00:48:58,331 --> 00:48:59,164
area and kill and rape and then spread,
spread out and then keep going and 

1131
00:49:02,531 --> 00:49:05,650
everybody else just keeps going and they
eventually fortify in the distance.

1132
00:49:05,651 --> 00:49:06,484
You get a new city and they try to hold 
them off and then new people coming 

1133
00:49:08,531 --> 00:49:09,364
through.
I mean there's so many instances from 

1134
00:49:11,741 --> 00:49:12,574
the mon goals to the Romans being go 
back and back and matt all through 

1135
00:49:15,191 --> 00:49:16,510
history,
but if you broke it down,

1136
00:49:16,511 --> 00:49:19,210
if you looked at it like a math problem,
like what's happening here,

1137
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:20,193
here's this happening.
These groups of people get together and 

1138
00:49:21,551 --> 00:49:22,384
then they develop some shit there,
kills other groups of people and they 

1139
00:49:24,041 --> 00:49:26,160
push into those groups of people and try
to fuck their chicks,

1140
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:29,140
steal money,
fuck the chicks,

1141
00:49:29,150 --> 00:49:31,460
eat their food,
and then they do the same thing and then

1142
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:34,600
and then people go back and forth and 
this is all people have done.

1143
00:49:34,780 --> 00:49:37,720
Like there's never been a time where no 
one was at war.

1144
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:40,690
Like if you've ever gone through human 
history,

1145
00:49:40,691 --> 00:49:41,524
there's no like,
well there was a period of a hundred 

1146
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:44,410
years where there was no warrants.
It's never happened.

1147
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:47,110
Never ever happened.
You're the best guy to ask about.

1148
00:49:47,111 --> 00:49:50,140
This isn't impressive how they built 
those arrows,

1149
00:49:50,260 --> 00:49:51,093
right?
The craftsmanship because their proper 

1150
00:49:51,821 --> 00:49:52,720
error,
what they look like.

1151
00:49:52,721 --> 00:49:55,390
They have pictures of the arrows,
but apparently he died.

1152
00:49:55,391 --> 00:49:56,224
Just have the arrows hitting them.
So the way I was thinking it was in 

1153
00:49:57,881 --> 00:50:00,790
order for an Arrow to be done properly,
right,

1154
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:03,130
and you could aim and then hit someone 
and killed them.

1155
00:50:03,131 --> 00:50:05,740
It has to go through the whole structure
of the pelvis.

1156
00:50:05,830 --> 00:50:06,850
No,
it doesn't have to.

1157
00:50:06,851 --> 00:50:07,684
I mean,
especially with the kid hit a bunch of 

1158
00:50:08,771 --> 00:50:09,750
times,
you know,

1159
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:11,860
if they hit him a bunch of times,
they get a shot him in the gut.

1160
00:50:12,140 --> 00:50:12,973
Shitty arrows.
Well I don't think they have shitty 

1161
00:50:14,291 --> 00:50:16,090
hours because they need them to survive.
Right.

1162
00:50:16,091 --> 00:50:19,870
So there has got to be island animals 
and they're hunting these animals.

1163
00:50:20,170 --> 00:50:24,560
But it's not that hard for these people 
and these kinds of tribes to,

1164
00:50:24,890 --> 00:50:27,040
if they have the proper would on the 
island,

1165
00:50:27,290 --> 00:50:28,400
you know,
they um,

1166
00:50:28,670 --> 00:50:29,503
they've been.
People have been making bows and arrows 

1167
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:31,694
for a long time and they,
they'll use certain fibers from certain 

1168
00:50:34,251 --> 00:50:38,580
trees and they weave them together and 
make a bowstring and you know,

1169
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:39,433
if they have enough goodwood and they 
have good fiber and they have the 

1170
00:50:44,511 --> 00:50:45,920
knowledge.
I mean,

1171
00:50:45,921 --> 00:50:46,754
even if they don't have metal,
you could still to this day I found one 

1172
00:50:49,461 --> 00:50:51,290
in Nevada.
I found an old,

1173
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:54,680
I don't know what era it's from,
but I found a an arrowhead,

1174
00:50:55,130 --> 00:50:55,963
but while I was actually bow hunting,
I found an actual arrowhead from some 

1175
00:50:59,511 --> 00:51:00,344
native American tribe that they left by 
and apparently they were like really 

1176
00:51:02,601 --> 00:51:03,434
common,
like people find them all the time 

1177
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:05,833
because you think of the thousands of 
years that the indigenous people were 

1178
00:51:07,971 --> 00:51:10,970
here and all the different animals they 
shot with bows and arrows.

1179
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:14,480
They figured out how to do it so these 
people must know how to do it too and if

1180
00:51:14,481 --> 00:51:15,314
they have enough good stone to make 
something flint or something similar to 

1181
00:51:19,371 --> 00:51:22,700
make the arrowheads or maybe they're 
using something toxic,

1182
00:51:22,730 --> 00:51:23,563
maybe they have some sort of toxic plant
and they just dipping the tip of a 

1183
00:51:27,231 --> 00:51:28,610
sharpened tip into it.

1184
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:32,850
If if you dip the tip and something 
toxic,

1185
00:51:33,180 --> 00:51:35,910
don't can you eat.
That means you can apparently,

1186
00:51:36,050 --> 00:51:39,420
but not the area near the question.
It's a good question.

1187
00:51:39,421 --> 00:51:40,254
I don't know,
but a lot of these tribes that shoot 

1188
00:51:42,241 --> 00:51:45,900
things that shoot things with poison on 
the end of their arrows.

1189
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:47,340
Yeah.
Well,

1190
00:51:47,340 --> 00:51:50,010
the idea is that they just didn't want 
to eat it,

1191
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:50,873
right?
They don't,

1192
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:52,073
if they don't hit it perfectly,
they're not going to wait for the 

1193
00:51:53,401 --> 00:51:54,234
perfect shot.
They're just trying to hit it so they 

1194
00:51:55,471 --> 00:51:58,140
can hit it in the ass or in the neck or 
wherever the fuck they hid it.

1195
00:51:58,141 --> 00:52:00,870
If they have poison,
that thing's going to die.

1196
00:52:01,110 --> 00:52:03,420
You know,
they used poison for a lot of weird shit

1197
00:52:03,421 --> 00:52:04,330
to the,
uh,

1198
00:52:04,410 --> 00:52:06,600
use poison to fish.
It's really strange.

1199
00:52:06,810 --> 00:52:08,340
They tape this season.
The fish.

1200
00:52:08,790 --> 00:52:09,810
Yeah.
Yeah.

1201
00:52:09,811 --> 00:52:10,644
It's crazy.
They take this plant and they smash it 

1202
00:52:12,421 --> 00:52:12,970
up

1203
00:52:12,970 --> 00:52:15,550
and they make this green.
That was,

1204
00:52:15,551 --> 00:52:18,330
that the Yanomami may have,
um,

1205
00:52:18,790 --> 00:52:20,950
some more,
maybe Bolivia or something like that.

1206
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:23,800
It's one of those tribal peoples that 
lives almost,

1207
00:52:23,890 --> 00:52:24,723
almost uncontacted,
but still some like w they'll have like 

1208
00:52:27,851 --> 00:52:30,010
under armour tee shirts on and it's 
weird.

1209
00:52:30,340 --> 00:52:31,520
It's weird,
but you know,

1210
00:52:31,540 --> 00:52:35,980
the barefoot and they take these plants 
and I forget what the planet is,

1211
00:52:35,981 --> 00:52:39,040
but they smash this plant up and make 
like this green pulp.

1212
00:52:39,370 --> 00:52:43,780
And then they put this pulp in these 
ponds and these fish just float.

1213
00:52:44,110 --> 00:52:44,943
It's some sort of toxin and it just 
fucks these fish up and they just float 

1214
00:52:48,101 --> 00:52:48,934
up to the top and then they'd go and 
scoop the fish and take them out of 

1215
00:52:51,221 --> 00:52:52,960
there,
but it like paralyzes them.

1216
00:52:53,060 --> 00:52:54,260
It's not toxic to us,
I guess.

1217
00:52:54,620 --> 00:52:56,700
I don't know man.
I mean maybe they lit up,

1218
00:52:56,830 --> 00:53:00,860
but I guess you have to be really 
fucking hungry to think,

1219
00:53:00,861 --> 00:53:03,710
okay,
I'm not killing enough or getting enough

1220
00:53:03,711 --> 00:53:07,400
fruits or vegetables.
I'm going to poison these things and I'd

1221
00:53:07,401 --> 00:53:10,490
rather die being poisoned than starving 
to death.

1222
00:53:10,710 --> 00:53:11,543
Well,
I think

1223
00:53:11,690 --> 00:53:12,523
full have been on the edge of survival,
like they've figured out survival down 

1224
00:53:16,131 --> 00:53:20,930
to like everything in their area.
They know what's edible.

1225
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:23,600
They know what's dangerous,
what to avoid,

1226
00:53:23,601 --> 00:53:26,220
what to cultivate,
what to seek

1227
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:27,360
out.
They just,

1228
00:53:28,010 --> 00:53:29,400
you know,
they know how to do it,

1229
00:53:29,401 --> 00:53:30,234
so if these people are on,
if it's a resource rich island and it 

1230
00:53:32,930 --> 00:53:34,740
seems to be like an island in the middle
of the ocean,

1231
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:36,113
as long as they don't kill too much,
as long as they keep a certain healthy 

1232
00:53:39,211 --> 00:53:41,970
population of animals around are 
cognizant of that as this.

1233
00:53:41,971 --> 00:53:42,930
These people,
yes,

1234
00:53:42,931 --> 00:53:47,840
the video I found in 2008 where some 
fishermen or someone found them and them

1235
00:53:48,310 --> 00:53:49,860
coconuts.
Wow.

1236
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:52,530
So these people apparently,
um,

1237
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:56,010
if you,
if you follow the story,

1238
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:57,113
they came from Africa 60 something 
thousand years ago and I guess probably 

1239
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:06,030
during the ice age the coastline was 
very different,

1240
00:54:06,031 --> 00:54:09,060
right?
The water levels were way lower and then

1241
00:54:09,061 --> 00:54:12,660
when the ice melted,
the oceans rose and then we get,

1242
00:54:12,690 --> 00:54:13,523
we got now.
So maybe it was a much larger island or 

1243
00:54:16,171 --> 00:54:18,780
maybe it was like the bearing landmass 
where you could get across it.

1244
00:54:19,460 --> 00:54:20,293
Fuck your friends.
Speak a language that no one else not 

1245
00:54:23,971 --> 00:54:27,420
even close to anything else since it's 
been so long.

1246
00:54:27,690 --> 00:54:28,523
Fuck man.
Here's combined with Lang throw it here 

1247
00:54:30,961 --> 00:54:33,240
is combined with body language who 
seemed to have a link.

1248
00:54:34,410 --> 00:54:37,320
So they were like telling him to throw 
things and they'd given him coconuts.

1249
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:41,460
That's pretty cool.
It's crazy how friendly they are without

1250
00:54:41,461 --> 00:54:43,110
knowing who the person is and where 
they're from.

1251
00:54:43,170 --> 00:54:45,180
Well,
I mean the dude's giving them free food,

1252
00:54:45,270 --> 00:54:47,610
so I think they're pumped.
You get a bunch of free.

1253
00:54:47,611 --> 00:54:50,360
Coconut is definitely a way to come 
friends with people,

1254
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:52,253
that guy,
if that guy had coconuts instead of a 

1255
00:54:54,001 --> 00:54:57,360
Bible,
probably through bibles,

1256
00:54:57,361 --> 00:54:59,790
they're like,
fuck it.

1257
00:54:59,930 --> 00:55:01,580
Tried to eat the Bible up there.
Like,

1258
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:03,240
motherfucker,
look at that.

1259
00:55:03,241 --> 00:55:05,910
Imagine some guy just showing up and 
giving you free food.

1260
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:07,860
Can you see my Dick?

1261
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:10,470
Is that what is,
what is this video?

1262
00:55:10,850 --> 00:55:11,880
Some videos.
Outrageous.

1263
00:55:11,910 --> 00:55:13,140
That's a real translation.
Yeah.

1264
00:55:13,230 --> 00:55:14,190
Yeah.
I,

1265
00:55:14,290 --> 00:55:15,360
I really.
Um,

1266
00:55:15,810 --> 00:55:18,360
so it says a wooden act similar to a 
mountain acts.

1267
00:55:18,390 --> 00:55:19,223
Yeah.
That's a fucking crazy looking carried 

1268
00:55:20,611 --> 00:55:21,720
by all men.
So they.

1269
00:55:21,721 --> 00:55:25,680
Yeah.
So they might not even have like metal.

1270
00:55:26,490 --> 00:55:31,490
It seems like if he's got a wooden acts,
I wonder if they have what they're using

1271
00:55:31,561 --> 00:55:35,750
for arrowheads and stuff like that.
This kind of fucking interests.

1272
00:55:35,990 --> 00:55:37,980
Oh dude is fascinating man.
The thing is,

1273
00:55:37,981 --> 00:55:42,981
it's really what's weird about it is you
can't really go there like Jay,

1274
00:55:43,110 --> 00:55:48,110
you guys ever read or watched that movie
about the city ofZ ,

1275
00:55:48,870 --> 00:55:50,700
the lost city of z?
Is that what it was called?

1276
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:52,913
It was about an explorer from England 
who made his way to South America and 

1277
00:55:56,641 --> 00:55:58,890
eventually got eaten by cannibals.
Allegedly,

1278
00:55:58,891 --> 00:55:59,724
they think,
oh,

1279
00:55:59,930 --> 00:56:03,390
but he was looking for this last Mayan 
or Aztec city.

1280
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:05,250
Was it a Mayan city?
Lost City of Z.

1281
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:07,950
Amazon.
Yeah,

1282
00:56:07,951 --> 00:56:09,300
so he was looking for some,
you know,

1283
00:56:09,301 --> 00:56:10,530
apparently,
and they've.

1284
00:56:10,710 --> 00:56:13,050
They know this for sure now.
There's some really,

1285
00:56:13,051 --> 00:56:13,884
really,
really ancient cities in the Amazon and 

1286
00:56:16,621 --> 00:56:18,930
they don't know what they are.
They don't know from when.

1287
00:56:19,020 --> 00:56:19,853
They don't know who built them,
so they don't even know who it's 

1288
00:56:22,170 --> 00:56:23,310
different culture.
Well,

1289
00:56:23,350 --> 00:56:24,183
it's a culture that's long gone and it's
the area where they had the city has 

1290
00:56:27,581 --> 00:56:29,260
been absorbed by the jungle,
so they,

1291
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:30,513
they find it,
I think either from satellites or from 

1292
00:56:32,321 --> 00:56:33,154
some kind of imagery where they're 
noticing these really obvious grid 

1293
00:56:36,761 --> 00:56:37,594
patterns that indicate irrigation and 
that they had fields and they had 

1294
00:56:40,931 --> 00:56:44,860
streets and so this.
There's this English explorer.

1295
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:47,740
What was the gentleman's name?
Harry Faucet.

1296
00:56:47,790 --> 00:56:52,120
Here's the book's not bad.
Percy Percy Fawcett and so this,

1297
00:56:52,150 --> 00:56:52,983
this dude went to the jungles of Brazil 
multiple times looking for this lost 

1298
00:56:56,981 --> 00:56:58,660
city of gold to 18,
60.

1299
00:56:58,660 --> 00:57:01,390
So yeah.
So he was really,

1300
00:57:01,391 --> 00:57:03,070
it's a cool movie,
but not,

1301
00:57:03,210 --> 00:57:04,043
it's not the best movie,
but it's cool because it's like you get 

1302
00:57:06,341 --> 00:57:10,990
to see the lost city of z.
He found it before he was killed.

1303
00:57:11,020 --> 00:57:11,351
No,
no,

1304
00:57:11,351 --> 00:57:13,570
no.
Like he found something.

1305
00:57:13,690 --> 00:57:16,270
He found that I don't want to spoil the 
movie,

1306
00:57:16,660 --> 00:57:18,850
but it's um,
it's not a bad movie.

1307
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:20,620
What's interesting to me is that these 
people,

1308
00:57:20,830 --> 00:57:21,663
you just got to put yourself in the mind
of people that lived in 1860 and they 

1309
00:57:24,940 --> 00:57:29,050
literally had no idea what the fuck was 
going on in South America.

1310
00:57:29,051 --> 00:57:31,150
They just.
But someone would come back and say,

1311
00:57:31,170 --> 00:57:36,170
author has a story of his jetties down 
the jungle river and the guy would stand

1312
00:57:36,971 --> 00:57:37,804
up.
We met the uncontacted tribe and they 

1313
00:57:39,611 --> 00:57:42,190
would talk about,
I have brought back pod pottery and this

1314
00:57:42,191 --> 00:57:43,024
is a spearhead and you know,
and here's drawings of the animals that 

1315
00:57:46,211 --> 00:57:50,380
I saw as get drawings of crocodiles and 
fucking giant Paranas and shit.

1316
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:52,430
It must,
must've been guys that made that shit up

1317
00:57:52,431 --> 00:57:53,264
though,
like the difference between a guy that 

1318
00:57:54,981 --> 00:57:58,400
actually had real pottery and just me 
getting my wife,

1319
00:57:58,430 --> 00:57:59,860
hey,
make a full will.

1320
00:57:59,870 --> 00:58:01,520
You know,
that happened with the dinosaurs,

1321
00:58:01,521 --> 00:58:02,354
right?
That people would pretend to say I have 

1322
00:58:03,741 --> 00:58:05,870
seen dinosaurs like in Australia.
No,

1323
00:58:05,930 --> 00:58:06,411
no,
no.

1324
00:58:06,411 --> 00:58:07,244
When,
when they first discovered that a 

1325
00:58:08,241 --> 00:58:09,074
dinosaur was a thing,
some people started faking it and they 

1326
00:58:12,771 --> 00:58:15,950
would come up with fake dinosaurs to a 
disorder,

1327
00:58:15,951 --> 00:58:16,784
like boost their science credit and 
these are like legitimate people or 

1328
00:58:19,791 --> 00:58:21,290
thought to be,
you know,

1329
00:58:21,291 --> 00:58:25,100
the credibility accountability rather 
back then was not what it is today.

1330
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:25,953
Like you don't.
I don't think the peer review process 

1331
00:58:27,891 --> 00:58:28,724
was the sound of these fucking people 
were maniacs out there just trying to 

1332
00:58:31,131 --> 00:58:31,964
pretend that they found dinosaurs.
So they use like go fuck a buffalo park 

1333
00:58:36,211 --> 00:58:37,044
or some shit.

1334
00:58:37,330 --> 00:58:38,500
And they're like,
look what I found.

1335
00:58:38,530 --> 00:58:40,640
I can't believe it's right here.
I mean I was just digging randomly.

1336
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:44,900
Even now though,
even if you found bones from an elephant

1337
00:58:45,260 --> 00:58:47,450
and you said,
Hey,

1338
00:58:47,451 --> 00:58:48,284
I dug this out in Vermont.
People like people would be like that 

1339
00:58:51,231 --> 00:58:52,140
camp.
Well,

1340
00:58:52,230 --> 00:58:53,063
what is that thing that's like nine feet
long for a little while and then you 

1341
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,190
know,
actual scientists will get ahold of it.

1342
00:58:58,230 --> 00:58:58,671
I go,
well,

1343
00:58:58,671 --> 00:59:00,650
this is an elephant bone.
You fucking idiot.

1344
00:59:00,680 --> 00:59:03,350
This is a dinosaur.
But if we were in 17,

1345
00:59:03,351 --> 00:59:04,410
46.
Yeah.

1346
00:59:05,300 --> 00:59:07,730
What year was it when they did that with
the dinosaur thing?

1347
00:59:08,430 --> 00:59:11,210
Yeah,
there were some sort of like a battle,

1348
00:59:11,211 --> 00:59:13,580
like everybody's trying to discover the 
latest and the greatest.

1349
00:59:13,581 --> 00:59:15,440
They'd pee shit together.
It didn't belong.

1350
00:59:15,980 --> 00:59:18,110
It was.
There was some weird wackiness.

1351
00:59:18,710 --> 00:59:22,190
But you know what's fascinating to me is
that something has to

1352
00:59:22,340 --> 00:59:23,173
die in like mud or it has to die and it 
has to be at the bottom of the ocean or 

1353
00:59:28,131 --> 00:59:28,964
a lake in silk.
Something has to happen to preserve 

1354
00:59:31,041 --> 00:59:34,130
those bones because if it doesn't then 
you get nothing.

1355
00:59:35,210 --> 00:59:36,043
That's why we don't,
we don't know Jack Shit about what like 

1356
00:59:39,470 --> 00:59:44,060
octopus look like with Octopi looked 
like $5 million years ago,

1357
00:59:44,061 --> 00:59:45,580
60 million years ago.
Like,

1358
00:59:45,660 --> 00:59:46,493
like the cracking,
like that could have easily been a real 

1359
00:59:48,471 --> 00:59:49,400
thing.
Right.

1360
00:59:49,401 --> 00:59:50,234
A fucking super enormous octopus that 
could eat whales because there are some 

1361
00:59:53,661 --> 00:59:55,100
big fucking words.
I've seen some videos.

1362
00:59:55,101 --> 00:59:56,720
Yeah,
but they don't have.

1363
00:59:56,810 --> 00:59:58,710
There's no bones.
No.

1364
00:59:58,780 --> 01:00:00,830
They just die in mud.
Yeah.

1365
01:00:00,831 --> 01:00:05,030
It has to tie in something to become 
fossilized now.

1366
01:00:05,031 --> 01:00:05,601
Yeah.
It's weird.

1367
01:00:05,601 --> 01:00:07,580
It is.
When you're seeing that fossil,

1368
01:00:07,610 --> 01:00:08,443
do you know that that's not really the 
bone that has all the mineral that has 

1369
01:00:11,751 --> 01:00:12,584
replaced the bone over like thousands 
and millions of years or whatever it 

1370
01:00:15,411 --> 01:00:15,650
takes?

1371
01:00:15,650 --> 01:00:17,120
Yeah.
When something's fossilized,

1372
01:00:17,390 --> 01:00:20,690
like if you see like a fossilized shark 
tooth and it's black,

1373
01:00:21,260 --> 01:00:22,093
that's not the real color of the teeth.
It's the color of all the minerals that 

1374
01:00:25,491 --> 01:00:26,324
have replaced what the tooth used to be 
as it remains compressed and all this 

1375
01:00:30,170 --> 01:00:32,810
sludge and mud and shit over millions of
years.

1376
01:00:32,811 --> 01:00:33,644
It's pretty freaky shit.
So like when you see these dinosaur 

1377
01:00:35,781 --> 01:00:36,614
bones,
they're like,

1378
01:00:36,830 --> 01:00:38,390
they're fossilized.
A lot of them,

1379
01:00:38,510 --> 01:00:39,343
like a lot of the bones that we find a 
dead things they've become like a piece 

1380
01:00:42,381 --> 01:00:43,214
of rock to could look completely 
different because I've heard people say 

1381
01:00:46,371 --> 01:00:50,180
that most dinosaurs that we look at now 
that we think about how they look,

1382
01:00:50,210 --> 01:00:51,043
they really had feathers now thing.
I just assumed that the sound of 

1383
01:00:54,231 --> 01:00:56,150
Jurassic Park is correct.
Probably isn't.

1384
01:00:56,151 --> 01:00:58,760
Whatever the fuck they sounded like.
They might not have made any noise here.

1385
01:00:58,760 --> 01:01:01,410
The great dinosaur fossil hooks.
Oh,

1386
01:01:01,570 --> 01:01:02,403
the new one.
China has enjoyed unprecedented gold 

1387
01:01:04,101 --> 01:01:08,330
rush of feather dinosaur fossils,
but how many are real?

1388
01:01:08,660 --> 01:01:11,210
Yeah,
there have been some feathered fossils.

1389
01:01:11,630 --> 01:01:12,463
If you go to the.
There's a museum in Montana and Bozeman 

1390
01:01:16,730 --> 01:01:18,920
in the museum,
some sort of science museum,

1391
01:01:18,950 --> 01:01:23,870
and they have a one of those rappers,
a velociraptor with feathers,

1392
01:01:23,960 --> 01:01:26,350
like a model of it,
like a life size Velossa,

1393
01:01:26,590 --> 01:01:31,460
like like a freaky demon.
That my first thing you ever want to see

1394
01:01:31,461 --> 01:01:34,280
before you die.
I'm afraid of birds,

1395
01:01:34,580 --> 01:01:37,100
so imagine how fucking big bird like 
that.

1396
01:01:37,101 --> 01:01:39,110
I lose my fucking mind.
Here it is.

1397
01:01:39,140 --> 01:01:42,050
Here's the bone wars.
The great dinosaur rush.

1398
01:01:42,051 --> 01:01:47,051
A period of intense and ruthlessly 
competitive fossil hunting and discovery

1399
01:01:47,301 --> 01:01:49,700
during the gilded age of American 
history,

1400
01:01:50,060 --> 01:01:55,060
marked by the heated rivalry between 
Edwin drinker cope drinker.

1401
01:01:55,600 --> 01:01:56,433
That's what Middle Lane Bro of the 
Academy of Natural Sciences of 

1402
01:01:58,761 --> 01:01:59,594
Philadelphia.
And whilst this guy's name authentic 

1403
01:02:01,931 --> 01:02:06,931
real othniel,
what do you say that is off Neil Othniel

1404
01:02:07,160 --> 01:02:10,680
Charles Marsh of the peabody museum of 
natural history of the year.

1405
01:02:11,300 --> 01:02:12,133
Each of the two paleontologists use 
underhanded methods to outdo each other 

1406
01:02:15,261 --> 01:02:17,690
in the field,
resulting resorted to bribery,

1407
01:02:17,691 --> 01:02:19,590
theft,
and the destruction of bones.

1408
01:02:20,010 --> 01:02:20,843
East scientist also sought to ruin his 
rivals reputation and cut off its 

1409
01:02:24,751 --> 01:02:25,584
funding.
Use the attacks in scientific 

1410
01:02:27,271 --> 01:02:28,104
publications.
So this doesn't seem like these are the 

1411
01:02:29,701 --> 01:02:33,930
people that were using fake stuff.
I was like a fake shit.

1412
01:02:33,931 --> 01:02:34,260
Yeah,
this.

1413
01:02:34,260 --> 01:02:35,880
If this was happening,
they probably fake shit.

1414
01:02:36,900 --> 01:02:39,810
People are all crazy man.
Those guys like doing that.

1415
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:40,793
You can tell like at first that were 
real scientists and then they became 

1416
01:02:42,871 --> 01:02:44,490
famous and they're like,
oh shit.

1417
01:02:44,491 --> 01:02:45,324
I like being famous.
Imagine if I enjoy being a famous 

1418
01:02:48,991 --> 01:02:51,840
scientist in scholar.
Both the Chinese one.

1419
01:02:51,841 --> 01:02:52,674
What are you getting now from and also 
the Chinese is not known for making 

1420
01:02:54,931 --> 01:02:56,460
counterfeit stuff,
so I don't believe that article.

1421
01:02:56,490 --> 01:02:57,900
Right.
That's what they do.

1422
01:02:59,330 --> 01:03:01,890
They make whole cities.
They made Paris.

1423
01:03:02,190 --> 01:03:03,750
If you go to China,
there's a Paris.

1424
01:03:03,900 --> 01:03:07,350
I was in China,
I get a tour of China like two years ago

1425
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:11,070
and there's one of the guys bugging me.

1426
01:03:11,460 --> 01:03:12,293
He told me his,
his girlfriend loved France and there's 

1427
01:03:14,881 --> 01:03:18,090
a neighborhood in Shanghai.
It's exactly like France.

1428
01:03:18,270 --> 01:03:22,020
So he brought her to France and then she
was like,

1429
01:03:22,080 --> 01:03:22,913
not the Chinese ones better because it's
the exact replica and they do that now 

1430
01:03:27,811 --> 01:03:29,370
in the Arab.
My knees one is better.

1431
01:03:29,371 --> 01:03:34,040
She says Emirates,
they redid the.

1432
01:03:34,050 --> 01:03:35,160
They,
they redid a,

1433
01:03:35,250 --> 01:03:38,940
I think the,
the Sorbonne and the like.

1434
01:03:38,941 --> 01:03:43,941
They redid buildings from France.
So you're in the Arab Emirates and your.

1435
01:03:44,940 --> 01:03:45,773
Everything is exactly the same as it is 
in France except it's all like Saudis 

1436
01:03:51,310 --> 01:03:55,230
and people from Kuwait was a weird thing
to do.

1437
01:03:55,370 --> 01:03:59,670
Try to recreate a historical building 
that still exists.

1438
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:01,020
Yeah.
Yeah.

1439
01:04:01,710 --> 01:04:04,110
Put that effort into creating something.
You have no white people copy.

1440
01:04:04,111 --> 01:04:04,944
I think it's because they like it,
it's probably complicated to to cause 

1441
01:04:09,390 --> 01:04:10,260
they're like,
oh fuck,

1442
01:04:10,261 --> 01:04:14,610
we're gonna go to go to whatever country
is going to be food.

1443
01:04:14,610 --> 01:04:16,210
It's a food.
Going to be Halau.

1444
01:04:16,380 --> 01:04:18,630
Is it going to be complicated to go the 
mosque?

1445
01:04:18,750 --> 01:04:19,583
Fuck it.
Let's just next to the mosque and we'll 

1446
01:04:23,161 --> 01:04:23,994
be good.
This is enough oil money floating 

1447
01:04:24,781 --> 01:04:25,614
around.
They could probably build a whole world 

1448
01:04:26,491 --> 01:04:29,910
out in the desert.
They could visit New York City.

1449
01:04:30,090 --> 01:04:32,070
Here we are,
New York to fake Manhattan,

1450
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:36,730
Brooklyn Bridge cab drivers or river 
fucking makeover.

1451
01:04:36,930 --> 01:04:37,763
They're such dicks like that.
Building the biggest building in the 

1452
01:04:39,871 --> 01:04:41,880
world in Dubai.
When you go in,

1453
01:04:41,910 --> 01:04:42,743
in the elevator,
they turned the lights off and it 

1454
01:04:44,401 --> 01:04:48,720
becomes kind of like a ride and then it 
starts going up and then it shows,

1455
01:04:48,721 --> 01:04:49,554
okay,
we're at the level that the biggest 

1456
01:04:51,031 --> 01:04:51,864
building in New York City,
like the empire state building is here 

1457
01:04:54,390 --> 01:04:55,223
at like whatever,
300 meters and then this is the biggest 

1458
01:04:58,351 --> 01:05:01,800
building in Shanghai and then they.
So they want to just show,

1459
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:04,350
look,
we got in the elevator,

1460
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:06,640
the elevator,
like they're like,

1461
01:05:06,900 --> 01:05:07,640
no bitch.

1462
01:05:07,640 --> 01:05:08,670
Yeah.
I said,

1463
01:05:08,730 --> 01:05:09,900
well,
money since they did,

1464
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:13,390
like the first time I was in Dubai,
the biggest building was a,

1465
01:05:13,620 --> 01:05:16,380
I don't know how big,
but they built one in Dubai and then the

1466
01:05:16,380 --> 01:05:19,270
year after Shanghai beat it by like 
three meters.

1467
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:21,730
And then Dubai was like,
fuck you,

1468
01:05:21,731 --> 01:05:24,750
we're going to beat you by 500 meters.
So it's like a,

1469
01:05:24,760 --> 01:05:29,760
it's a kilometer or almost like a,
like more than half a mile high.

1470
01:05:31,220 --> 01:05:34,600
It's crazy high.
More than half a mile high.

1471
01:05:34,660 --> 01:05:36,700
Yeah.
That's St and the city,

1472
01:05:36,830 --> 01:05:37,663
would you say it that way?
You look and the city in the 19 

1473
01:05:40,871 --> 01:05:44,440
seventies didn't really exist.
So it was like,

1474
01:05:44,441 --> 01:05:45,274
this is fucking insane.
Like the national anthem could be the 

1475
01:05:48,221 --> 01:05:49,054
eye of the tiger.
It's fucking insane how big it got so 

1476
01:05:54,671 --> 01:05:56,820
quickly.
But they're all so fucking wretched.

1477
01:05:56,821 --> 01:05:57,940
It's insane.
Jamie,

1478
01:05:57,941 --> 01:05:59,320
what were you going to say?
Uh,

1479
01:05:59,650 --> 01:06:00,660
as you were saying that,
like,

1480
01:06:00,910 --> 01:06:02,800
I don't know why I'd definitely be 
registered before,

1481
01:06:02,801 --> 01:06:03,634
but king's island,
which is a theme park in Ohio and 

1482
01:06:05,231 --> 01:06:08,050
Cincinnati area,
there's the Eiffel Tower there.

1483
01:06:08,051 --> 01:06:10,450
There's also one somewhere else at 
another park.

1484
01:06:10,690 --> 01:06:12,490
Oh really?
I didn't say exact replica.

1485
01:06:12,491 --> 01:06:13,324
One third replica.
Eiffel Tower that's been there since 

1486
01:06:16,451 --> 01:06:17,284
like the seven.
But all those rich Arab countries will 

1487
01:06:18,921 --> 01:06:19,754
be like,
instead of one third seven times vague 

1488
01:06:22,651 --> 01:06:24,460
made of diamonds.
You can see,

1489
01:06:24,461 --> 01:06:26,620
you can see this Eiffel Tower from the 
moon.

1490
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:27,850
Gucci,
everything.

1491
01:06:30,660 --> 01:06:32,520
Yeah.
It's weird.

1492
01:06:32,530 --> 01:06:33,700
People do that.
But you know,

1493
01:06:33,730 --> 01:06:34,870
when you had that kind of money,
man,

1494
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:35,713
you make me a France.
What else am I going to do for their 

1495
01:06:39,430 --> 01:06:42,430
friends?
I want the countryside,

1496
01:06:42,431 --> 01:06:43,151
the whole thing,
man,

1497
01:06:43,151 --> 01:06:46,330
I want you to know I want to turn away 
because you're like,

1498
01:06:46,331 --> 01:06:50,080
make it like now your puck has gotten so
big in three years.

1499
01:06:50,081 --> 01:06:53,620
I want to hear Joe Rogan Belt Rome.
He's got a fake robe.

1500
01:06:54,620 --> 01:06:56,570
Oh,
that's why to five compound somewhere.

1501
01:06:56,780 --> 01:07:01,100
Don't dumped off.
Start selling a freeze dried food.

1502
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:05,810
Preparing everybody know water 
purification tablets.

1503
01:07:05,990 --> 01:07:07,610
Get ready solar panels.

1504
01:07:08,070 --> 01:07:09,410
Did you like dishes?
Did you.

1505
01:07:09,810 --> 01:07:11,230
Is Your House okay?
Yeah,

1506
01:07:11,231 --> 01:07:12,064
we got lucky.
We got lucky that someone said Google 

1507
01:07:15,551 --> 01:07:17,300
this,
that Malibu last six,

1508
01:07:17,370 --> 01:07:19,070
600 houses.
What?

1509
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:21,580
Yeah,
someone said that the other day,

1510
01:07:21,820 --> 01:07:22,653
but everyone's hysterical.
It's hard to know if they're right or 

1511
01:07:24,701 --> 01:07:27,730
not.
How many houses got lost at Malibu?

1512
01:07:30,730 --> 01:07:32,860
Because I know a lot of people that have
lost houses.

1513
01:07:32,920 --> 01:07:37,920
I know at least eight people that have 
lost houses.

1514
01:07:38,730 --> 01:07:42,470
And how was the evacuation [inaudible]?
Was it like area like you,

1515
01:07:42,471 --> 01:07:45,660
you can just grab like one.
One or two things.

1516
01:07:45,860 --> 01:07:46,100
Grab

1517
01:07:46,100 --> 01:07:48,230
my laptop.
1,500

1518
01:07:48,231 --> 01:07:50,150
structures.
1,500

1519
01:07:51,260 --> 01:07:56,260
totally destroyed Jesus Christ.
So the number probably keeps going up,

1520
01:07:57,530 --> 01:07:59,570
but those are.
A lot of them are homes,

1521
01:08:00,230 --> 01:08:01,850
you know,
out of those 1500,

1522
01:08:01,851 --> 01:08:04,340
I don't know how many of them are homes,
but a lot of them are.

1523
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:06,740
A lot of people lost their homes.
It's a,

1524
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:07,833
it's a crazy thing that happens.
The wind gets behind that fire and 

1525
01:08:10,611 --> 01:08:14,270
everything's dry and it just goes 
straight to the water and there's almost

1526
01:08:14,271 --> 01:08:16,070
nothing they could do.
They lost so

1527
01:08:16,070 --> 01:08:18,620
many houses on point dume,
which you would think,

1528
01:08:18,621 --> 01:08:20,420
how the fuck is a fire going to get to 
that?

1529
01:08:20,720 --> 01:08:21,553
Like if you ever see what point dume is,
it's like this beautiful area of very 

1530
01:08:25,011 --> 01:08:28,940
wealthy people live in this,
this cliff overlooking the ocean.

1531
01:08:28,941 --> 01:08:29,774
I mean spectacular and like you would 
never think that a wildfire we get 

1532
01:08:33,771 --> 01:08:36,180
there,
but it was raining fire man.

1533
01:08:36,200 --> 01:08:38,220
That's point dume out there.
So,

1534
01:08:38,380 --> 01:08:39,213
so many of those houses got cooked man 
and there's videos that people made of 

1535
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:44,233
them leaving their horrific.
There's like fire raining from the sky 

1536
01:08:48,021 --> 01:08:52,490
everywhere you look houses on fire and 
this is a super exclusive,

1537
01:08:52,491 --> 01:08:55,100
really rich area and no one could 
protect it.

1538
01:08:55,340 --> 01:08:58,220
There was nothing they could do.
The firefighters did their best.

1539
01:08:58,221 --> 01:08:59,720
They saved as many structures as they 
can,

1540
01:08:59,721 --> 01:09:00,554
but it was fucking raging man.
It was a rocks throw from my house when 

1541
01:09:04,371 --> 01:09:04,820
we left.

1542
01:09:04,820 --> 01:09:06,070
We left at 2:00
in the morning,

1543
01:09:06,230 --> 01:09:07,490
Thursday night.
The traffic,

1544
01:09:07,491 --> 01:09:08,324
because the traffic is always crazy.
So when you evacuate and the traffic's 

1545
01:09:11,840 --> 01:09:13,760
like that must,
you must freak out.

1546
01:09:14,710 --> 01:09:16,850
Scary is what happened to the people in 
paradise,

1547
01:09:16,851 --> 01:09:17,684
California,
they were evacuating and something like 

1548
01:09:19,611 --> 01:09:20,444
60 plus people died in their cars.
The fire just overcame cars and there's 

1549
01:09:25,100 --> 01:09:25,933
nowhere to go and they're stuck in 
gridlock and the fires literally coming 

1550
01:09:28,641 --> 01:09:32,420
at them ready for this 80 football 
fields a minute.

1551
01:09:33,170 --> 01:09:34,970
That's how fast it was.
Traveling at some.

1552
01:09:35,030 --> 01:09:37,940
At one point.
See what happens over the summer.

1553
01:09:39,170 --> 01:09:41,060
There's a town right outside of Athens,
Greece.

1554
01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:41,953
Yet wildfires took over.
The town was wiped off in a couple of 

1555
01:09:44,601 --> 01:09:46,160
minutes.
People died in their cars and homes.

1556
01:09:46,161 --> 01:09:47,570
You couldn't get out.
They were just traveling.

1557
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:48,433
That's what happens in paradise.
I think a lot more than a thousand 

1558
01:09:52,101 --> 01:09:54,250
people are missing paradise.

1559
01:09:54,680 --> 01:09:55,513
Yeah.
They don't even know and the problem is 

1560
01:09:56,781 --> 01:10:00,530
they'll never know like whatever was 
there is incinerated.

1561
01:10:00,650 --> 01:10:01,483
There's nothing left.
Like they won't be able to get DNA that 

1562
01:10:05,200 --> 01:10:06,033
it's over.
I mean it's the craziest fire they've 

1563
01:10:08,391 --> 01:10:10,850
ever experienced it.
I think it's the scariest,

1564
01:10:10,851 --> 01:10:13,010
most destructive California wildfire 
ever,

1565
01:10:13,310 --> 01:10:14,143
and that one,
the one down here was nothing compared 

1566
01:10:15,981 --> 01:10:19,550
to that one in northern California and 
comparison to the size and scope.

1567
01:10:19,580 --> 01:10:22,040
I mean that thing is fucking insane.
There's fire,

1568
01:10:22,070 --> 01:10:25,970
there's a photo of this one.
Firefighter has sort of iconic photo.

1569
01:10:26,210 --> 01:10:27,043
He standing on a rock and behind him the
whole mountain is on fire and it's just 

1570
01:10:32,451 --> 01:10:33,284
like holy shit.
And people in my friend Brendan Child 

1571
01:10:37,671 --> 01:10:41,090
was doing a show in Sacramento,
in Sacramento,

1572
01:10:41,300 --> 01:10:45,260
out his hotel room.
The whole street was filled with smoke.

1573
01:10:45,380 --> 01:10:46,940
You couldn't see shit.
He's like,

1574
01:10:46,941 --> 01:10:48,440
dude,
smoke is everywhere.

1575
01:10:48,680 --> 01:10:49,513
And he sent me a photo of the television
that was showing the air quality was 

1576
01:10:52,070 --> 01:10:55,280
very poor.
Air Quality everywhere,

1577
01:10:55,550 --> 01:10:57,860
all through that area.
It's just all in red.

1578
01:10:58,100 --> 01:10:58,933
So it was all like people were walking 
around with masks on and it would 

1579
01:11:01,041 --> 01:11:03,920
literally be like you're walking through
a fire.

1580
01:11:03,980 --> 01:11:06,290
There's smoke everywhere.
Nuts,

1581
01:11:06,291 --> 01:11:08,480
Matt.
And this is in Sacramento?

1582
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:10,310
Yeah.
Fuck yeah.

1583
01:11:11,010 --> 01:11:13,290
Is it contained now?
Sort of contained?

1584
01:11:13,770 --> 01:11:14,603
I mean

1585
01:11:14,610 --> 01:11:18,030
the one here is,
but I don't know about the one that's up

1586
01:11:18,031 --> 01:11:18,864
north,
but the real issue is that could happen 

1587
01:11:20,011 --> 01:11:22,350
again like that.
Like they all,

1588
01:11:22,380 --> 01:11:25,440
they're all.
They sparked up so quick and more hit.

1589
01:11:25,680 --> 01:11:26,513
What's the plan that they could do to 
make sure this doesn't happen or is 

1590
01:11:29,461 --> 01:11:31,670
there something they can do?
I don't know.

1591
01:11:31,740 --> 01:11:33,630
I don't know what they can do.
What does that Jamie.

1592
01:11:33,870 --> 01:11:35,760
The air quality in San Francisco is so 
bad.

1593
01:11:35,940 --> 01:11:38,070
Being there for a day is like slow 
smoking.

1594
01:11:38,071 --> 01:11:39,920
10 cigarettes.
Fuck.

1595
01:11:40,260 --> 01:11:42,180
Look at that picture.
That's all.

1596
01:11:42,240 --> 01:11:44,910
Fire smoke where people like Western 
mass,

1597
01:11:44,911 --> 01:11:46,950
I guess people are wearing masks.
They're like,

1598
01:11:46,951 --> 01:11:47,784
uh,
yeah.

1599
01:11:47,910 --> 01:11:48,743
Yeah.
Bert Kreischer was walking down the 

1600
01:11:50,131 --> 01:11:52,030
street with a mask on and I.
I texted him,

1601
01:11:52,230 --> 01:11:54,480
what the fuck are you doing man?
He's like,

1602
01:11:54,481 --> 01:11:55,710
dude,
it is so bad.

1603
01:11:55,770 --> 01:11:57,210
It's so bad.
Here it goes.

1604
01:11:57,350 --> 01:11:58,183
You can't believe how smokey the era's 
and there's just all through San 

1605
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:02,273
Francisco.
Everybody's coughing and wearing masks 

1606
01:12:03,181 --> 01:12:04,860
in Sacramento looked even worse than 
that.

1607
01:12:06,210 --> 01:12:08,520
It's kind of shit you never think about.
Yeah.

1608
01:12:08,970 --> 01:12:10,130
Yeah.
Well that's the thing.

1609
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:11,033
It could just hit you look at that data 
at San Francisco right now and if you 

1610
01:12:13,651 --> 01:12:17,160
don't know San Francisco,
you wouldn't know how shocking this is.

1611
01:12:17,580 --> 01:12:19,470
Like you.
You can't see the hills.

1612
01:12:19,800 --> 01:12:20,633
Can't see all those houses in the hills.
It's all just smoke from the fire for 

1613
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:24,833
that shit to blow out.
It looks like San Francisco super like 

1614
01:12:27,650 --> 01:12:29,450
just.
Yeah.

1615
01:12:29,820 --> 01:12:32,400
Hey,
is that fire contained?

1616
01:12:32,820 --> 01:12:33,653
A article with a couple of couple of 
days ago said it was at 57 percent 

1617
01:12:38,161 --> 01:12:39,870
contained and I was just trying to 
google more.

1618
01:12:40,040 --> 01:12:43,590
How about that?
Only 57 percent contained at the air's a

1619
01:12:43,591 --> 01:12:46,650
little clear today.
They're at moderate to severe whatever.

1620
01:12:46,650 --> 01:12:48,030
But see,
the thing is man,

1621
01:12:48,031 --> 01:12:51,900
but these fires,
all it needs is one gust of wind,

1622
01:12:51,901 --> 01:12:52,734
one new storm,
one new Santa Ana winds pick up some 

1623
01:12:56,641 --> 01:13:00,830
embers and then whoosh.
This whole state is just dries.

1624
01:13:00,870 --> 01:13:01,703
Fuck man to 80 percent,
but 80 percent contained going gonna 

1625
01:13:04,401 --> 01:13:08,580
rain tomorrow.
Hopefully that does.

1626
01:13:08,581 --> 01:13:09,870
It's supposed to rain tonight,
isn't it?

1627
01:13:11,570 --> 01:13:14,470
It's fucking like everyone who moved out
here,

1628
01:13:14,471 --> 01:13:16,770
like from out East Lake when you moved 
here,

1629
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:19,050
you've been here for 20 years,
20 years.

1630
01:13:19,860 --> 01:13:22,650
You must have been scared the first 
couple of years of earthquakes,

1631
01:13:22,830 --> 01:13:24,450
but you never thought that,
hey,

1632
01:13:24,451 --> 01:13:26,580
I might have to leave my house because 
of fire.

1633
01:13:26,730 --> 01:13:27,563
Dude,
I've been evacuated three times because 

1634
01:13:28,631 --> 01:13:29,220
of.
Because the fire.

1635
01:13:29,220 --> 01:13:30,090
Yeah,
Shit.

1636
01:13:30,150 --> 01:13:31,680
Yeah.
How many,

1637
01:13:31,710 --> 01:13:33,870
how many major earthquakes since you've 
been here?

1638
01:13:33,930 --> 01:13:36,000
None.
One minor one.

1639
01:13:36,720 --> 01:13:41,480
It was enough to let you know like Whoa,
like when it happens and the,

1640
01:13:41,510 --> 01:13:43,510
the,
the house seemed like a,

1641
01:13:44,190 --> 01:13:45,023
you ever get a refrigerator and you take
out that cardboard box and you stand 

1642
01:13:49,621 --> 01:13:52,350
inside of it as a kid and you'd push it 
around back and forth.

1643
01:13:52,770 --> 01:13:55,110
That's literally what the walls of my 
apartment looked like.

1644
01:13:55,130 --> 01:13:56,910
Oh.
He just started moving like this.

1645
01:13:56,911 --> 01:13:58,110
Like it was very different than I 
thought.

1646
01:13:58,111 --> 01:14:00,480
I thought it would be like shake,
like rumble.

1647
01:14:00,481 --> 01:14:01,820
Everything would shake.
No,

1648
01:14:01,821 --> 01:14:03,480
it was just like this dome,
Dome,

1649
01:14:03,900 --> 01:14:04,621
doom,
doom,

1650
01:14:04,621 --> 01:14:05,454
doom,
doom.

1651
01:14:05,490 --> 01:14:09,870
But it was so nothing.
It was a nothing earthquake.

1652
01:14:09,900 --> 01:14:12,610
It was like a five point or some shit or
five point seven,

1653
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:16,390
but it was enough to where when the 
walls moved you realize like,

1654
01:14:16,391 --> 01:14:19,030
Whoa,
if a big one happens,

1655
01:14:19,390 --> 01:14:22,690
this shit just falls apart.
Like this is not this thing.

1656
01:14:22,691 --> 01:14:24,880
Ain't gonna make it houses just fall 
apart.

1657
01:14:25,390 --> 01:14:27,190
The walls would just break.
Will floor.

1658
01:14:27,191 --> 01:14:30,490
Were you on a second floor?
That must.

1659
01:14:30,580 --> 01:14:33,070
That must like if you're on the ground 
floor,

1660
01:14:33,071 --> 01:14:33,731
you go,
okay,

1661
01:14:33,731 --> 01:14:34,564
I can run out the shit we can't,
but she lands in your head as you're 

1662
01:14:38,141 --> 01:14:38,974
trying to get at,
but you know how fucking stupid humans 

1663
01:14:40,841 --> 01:14:41,050
are.

1664
01:14:41,050 --> 01:14:41,883
We go like,
Nah,

1665
01:14:41,890 --> 01:14:43,060
I got this.
I can.

1666
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:46,210
I can run out the second floor.
I think the opposite.

1667
01:14:46,211 --> 01:14:47,380
I was thinking if I'm going to top 
floor,

1668
01:14:47,381 --> 01:14:48,214
I'll serve my way to the bottom.
I'll land on all these fuckers below me 

1669
01:14:51,530 --> 01:14:53,650
a dead.
He's not going to make it.

1670
01:14:54,520 --> 01:14:55,353
Yeah.
It was enough to just let me just 

1671
01:14:56,951 --> 01:14:59,200
realize like you don't even know what an
earthquake is.

1672
01:14:59,201 --> 01:15:01,790
Stupid.
Like my idea of an earthquake was like a

1673
01:15:01,810 --> 01:15:02,830
cartoon movie.
Like,

1674
01:15:02,831 --> 01:15:04,150
oh,
we're in an earthquake,

1675
01:15:04,570 --> 01:15:07,630
but a real earthquake is just the earth 
shifting.

1676
01:15:07,690 --> 01:15:11,620
It actually moves and apparently the 
people that were here during the big one

1677
01:15:11,621 --> 01:15:13,330
of 1993,
it was at 93,

1678
01:15:13,720 --> 01:15:17,650
something like that.
The earth moved almost like water,

1679
01:15:18,490 --> 01:15:21,850
like the.
You could see the earth just bucking and

1680
01:15:21,851 --> 01:15:22,684
moving and you could see like chunks of 
it like lifting up and then settling 

1681
01:15:26,321 --> 01:15:27,130
down.

1682
01:15:27,130 --> 01:15:29,020
The people that were there,
when you talk to them,

1683
01:15:29,080 --> 01:15:29,913
it's like there's,
I mean it's not ptsd like soldiers ptsd 

1684
01:15:34,781 --> 01:15:37,510
or like rape survivors or anything,
but there's,

1685
01:15:37,570 --> 01:15:41,320
there's absolutely some ptsd to comes 
from natural disasters.

1686
01:15:41,790 --> 01:15:42,623
Is this trauma to seeing how fucking 
meager you are in comparison to the 

1687
01:15:47,260 --> 01:15:50,710
earth itself as the earth is moving,
like fuck,

1688
01:15:50,711 --> 01:15:53,440
I got to get out of here and then a mass
exodus,

1689
01:15:53,441 --> 01:15:54,274
like bunch of people move to Colorado 
and people moved all over the fucking 

1690
01:15:57,011 --> 01:15:58,480
place.
Carla was nice though.

1691
01:15:58,481 --> 01:15:59,410
Here.
Colorado.

1692
01:15:59,450 --> 01:16:00,420
It's gorgeous.
Yeah.

1693
01:16:00,910 --> 01:16:03,730
I'm surprised at the now with the 
wildfires,

1694
01:16:03,910 --> 01:16:07,110
are people leaving California or no?
Um,

1695
01:16:07,250 --> 01:16:08,650
I'm sure some are.
Yeah.

1696
01:16:09,220 --> 01:16:13,720
The problem is the weather's so good.
It's so nice because it never rains.

1697
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:14,990
It never does anything.
You just,

1698
01:16:15,050 --> 01:16:15,883
you can be just a lazy bitch.
Just didn't ever have to deal with 

1699
01:16:19,181 --> 01:16:20,340
mother nature.
Like,

1700
01:16:20,350 --> 01:16:22,630
well you guys live here in Montreal,
right?

1701
01:16:22,920 --> 01:16:24,520
Yeah.
That's no joke.

1702
01:16:24,521 --> 01:16:26,380
Nuts.
They're having a snow storm right now.

1703
01:16:27,560 --> 01:16:29,830
That cold that you guys get up there as 
ruthless.

1704
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:32,260
I'm going to be in Toronto in December.
Okay,

1705
01:16:32,440 --> 01:16:33,273
cool.
I'm there for the UFC and I know it's 

1706
01:16:34,871 --> 01:16:38,770
going to be cold as fuck.
December it's going to have.

1707
01:16:38,780 --> 01:16:39,613
Plus this year is generally the winter 
starts later than now and it's super 

1708
01:16:45,941 --> 01:16:46,421
cold,
right?

1709
01:16:46,421 --> 01:16:48,070
Yeah.
What happened to global warming?

1710
01:16:49,690 --> 01:16:50,523
Global warming.

1711
01:16:52,720 --> 01:16:53,553
That's the first thing like those 
fucking hardcore righties want to do 

1712
01:16:58,270 --> 01:17:01,040
whereas doesn't exist.
It's slope warming.

1713
01:17:01,310 --> 01:17:02,680
Weird.
Where's your global warming?

1714
01:17:02,681 --> 01:17:05,400
Like hippies.
That simple pitch.

1715
01:17:05,630 --> 01:17:07,900
It's burning the fucking houses in 
Malibu.

1716
01:17:08,770 --> 01:17:09,790
Something.
Yeah.

1717
01:17:10,050 --> 01:17:11,990
And that what's really funny is the chem
trail people,

1718
01:17:11,991 --> 01:17:14,450
they've been convinced this whole time 
that the government is trying to make it

1719
01:17:14,451 --> 01:17:18,020
rain.
Like if ever there was a time to utilize

1720
01:17:18,021 --> 01:17:19,550
chem trails,
would it be now,

1721
01:17:19,990 --> 01:17:21,590
you know,
fuck man.

1722
01:17:21,800 --> 01:17:22,633
The whole thing is a,
it's very disconcerting because you 

1723
01:17:24,561 --> 01:17:28,100
realize how fragile the whole system is 
and these,

1724
01:17:28,130 --> 01:17:30,110
you know,
these people that worked so hard to save

1725
01:17:30,111 --> 01:17:31,850
everybody,
they can only save so much,

1726
01:17:32,290 --> 01:17:33,123
you know,
and they can only save so many 

1727
01:17:33,411 --> 01:17:35,300
buildings.
You can only save so many people.

1728
01:17:35,710 --> 01:17:37,250
It's a real wake up call.
Man.

1729
01:17:38,540 --> 01:17:43,540
Shit could get ugly and this off topic,
but off topic of the fires,

1730
01:17:44,151 --> 01:17:45,020
but because,
uh,

1731
01:17:45,290 --> 01:17:49,520
yesterday we're talking about red band 
at the store and I didn't know that when

1732
01:17:49,640 --> 01:17:50,473
the whole thing happened,
you were banned the whole crew for like 

1733
01:17:54,290 --> 01:17:55,970
seven years,
like a long time.

1734
01:17:57,240 --> 01:17:58,073
I've talked about this too many times.
The only thing I will tell you is 

1735
01:18:00,170 --> 01:18:01,003
because you took a bullet for the seven 
years is kind of like you took a bullet 

1736
01:18:03,381 --> 01:18:04,940
for everyone else was going to have to 
deal with that shit,

1737
01:18:05,090 --> 01:18:08,090
but you didn't know at the time the ads 
or to looking back.

1738
01:18:08,120 --> 01:18:09,230
I was just like,
fuck them.

1739
01:18:09,320 --> 01:18:11,120
Yeah.
You can say I was taking a bullet,

1740
01:18:11,121 --> 01:18:14,720
but I didn't think of it that way.
But yeah,

1741
01:18:14,810 --> 01:18:16,970
it's a thing.
The subjects beaten down too much,

1742
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:18,470
you know,
we're going through it now.

1743
01:18:18,471 --> 01:18:19,304
That's why on our end now we have the 
people who are making money by stealing 

1744
01:18:22,791 --> 01:18:24,350
jokes.
You have that going on in France?

1745
01:18:24,470 --> 01:18:25,303
Yeah.
No,

1746
01:18:25,610 --> 01:18:29,060
it's actually a French guy was doing it.
Not with a French comedy.

1747
01:18:29,120 --> 01:18:29,751
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

1748
01:18:29,751 --> 01:18:31,400
It's not in,
in Canada,

1749
01:18:31,430 --> 01:18:32,890
but it's in France.
And there,

1750
01:18:32,891 --> 01:18:33,760
uh,
there was,

1751
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:34,753
uh,
I own a club in Montreal and I banded 

1752
01:18:36,691 --> 01:18:38,060
guide this summer.
He's,

1753
01:18:38,061 --> 01:18:41,000
um,
he had stolen a bunch of material.

1754
01:18:41,300 --> 01:18:42,133
There's a thing called the GML comedy 
club that it's basically like how even 

1755
01:18:46,611 --> 01:18:49,220
when you say comedy club,
when you were saying something in French

1756
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:51,970
first you have to see comedy club.
Yeah.

1757
01:18:51,971 --> 01:18:52,480
Yeah.
Okay.

1758
01:18:52,480 --> 01:18:53,313
Yeah.
So,

1759
01:18:54,150 --> 01:18:57,380
because that's the way you say that.
This guy,

1760
01:18:57,381 --> 01:18:58,214
um,
he,

1761
01:18:58,320 --> 01:18:59,153
he had stolen a pretty much everything 
from def comedy jam and they did it 

1762
01:19:03,621 --> 01:19:06,440
there in France and just didn't with 
French language.

1763
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:09,800
Even with black dudes.
Like if you're going to steal def comedy

1764
01:19:09,801 --> 01:19:11,600
jam,
give it to French black dudes.

1765
01:19:11,601 --> 01:19:14,660
Like there are black dudes in France,
but it was all these Arab guys.

1766
01:19:14,810 --> 01:19:19,010
So whenever you see like for uh,
10 years in France,

1767
01:19:19,160 --> 01:19:21,480
whatever you sign an Arab comic,
they were all like,

1768
01:19:21,500 --> 01:19:23,710
like Dave Chappelle.
So there was,

1769
01:19:24,080 --> 01:19:25,610
yeah,
there was something very fucked up.

1770
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:26,593
And this summer there was,
the guy was in my club and then I found 

1771
01:19:30,261 --> 01:19:32,300
out and I fucking lost my mind and I 
just,

1772
01:19:32,301 --> 01:19:33,950
I,
I tweeted a,

1773
01:19:34,010 --> 01:19:35,210
my door guy.
And I was like,

1774
01:19:35,240 --> 01:19:38,480
get him the fuck out everyone.
He's with you throw them out.

1775
01:19:38,810 --> 01:19:41,510
I don't want them in the club strangers 
thing.

1776
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:42,060
Yeah.

1777
01:19:42,060 --> 01:19:42,893
With comedy,
you're trying to create things and some 

1778
01:19:46,280 --> 01:19:47,113
basically a criminal can sneak in the 
middle of an artist's colony and just 

1779
01:19:50,731 --> 01:19:55,230
start profiting off of your work and 
intimidating you and making you work for

1780
01:19:55,231 --> 01:19:56,070
them essentially.

1781
01:19:56,290 --> 01:19:57,123
Yeah.
There's something that sucks and people 

1782
01:19:58,131 --> 01:19:58,964
don't know.
And that's what you went through with 

1783
01:20:00,630 --> 01:20:02,720
when,
when you called out Carlos,

1784
01:20:04,310 --> 01:20:06,890
no one cares.
No one cares like they do now.

1785
01:20:07,080 --> 01:20:07,980
They do see the

1786
01:20:07,980 --> 01:20:10,800
thing is they don't know your situation 
up there is different,

1787
01:20:10,801 --> 01:20:15,480
but the only reason they do now because 
it looks good.

1788
01:20:16,260 --> 01:20:18,840
But if didn't like,
like,

1789
01:20:18,841 --> 01:20:22,260
um,
like banning Carlos now.

1790
01:20:22,261 --> 01:20:23,094
Like Carlos Mencia can't work anymore.
That it makes them look like we respect 

1791
01:20:27,451 --> 01:20:30,120
comedians,
but they don't really respect Comedians,

1792
01:20:30,390 --> 01:20:31,171
I don't think.
Well,

1793
01:20:31,171 --> 01:20:32,004
who's they in this?
You sound like you're a conspiracy 

1794
01:20:33,630 --> 01:20:35,610
theory.
They don't respect us,

1795
01:20:35,611 --> 01:20:36,500
man.
No,

1796
01:20:36,510 --> 01:20:37,343
but like whenever,
whenever I've called out a joke thieves 

1797
01:20:41,340 --> 01:20:43,830
to,
to festivals or networks,

1798
01:20:43,990 --> 01:20:44,821
they're like,
okay,

1799
01:20:44,821 --> 01:20:45,361
yeah,
yeah.

1800
01:20:45,361 --> 01:20:46,260
We're gonna.
We're gonna.

1801
01:20:46,261 --> 01:20:48,960
Do something about this and then as soon
as it blows over,

1802
01:20:49,050 --> 01:20:50,970
they don't do anything about it.
Yeah.

1803
01:20:50,971 --> 01:20:52,260
Well,
you're talking about festivals,

1804
01:20:52,261 --> 01:20:52,981
right?
You know,

1805
01:20:52,981 --> 01:20:53,814
I think,
um,

1806
01:20:54,060 --> 01:20:56,520
clubs would be much more likely to band 
people,

1807
01:20:56,521 --> 01:21:00,450
especially if someone who they're 
stealing from also works there.

1808
01:21:00,600 --> 01:21:02,070
That's,
that's more likely to happen.

1809
01:21:02,430 --> 01:21:04,250
Especially if the,
you know,

1810
01:21:04,251 --> 01:21:05,084
when in best case scenario the person 
who's getting stolen from is already 

1811
01:21:08,401 --> 01:21:10,710
established and successful.
So they could say something about it.

1812
01:21:10,920 --> 01:21:11,753
The worst case scenario,
someone who's established steals from 

1813
01:21:13,681 --> 01:21:16,320
open microphone,
which fucking does happen.

1814
01:21:16,980 --> 01:21:18,420
And um,
you know,

1815
01:21:18,630 --> 01:21:21,660
if there's anything that you'd get 
someone to quit comedy,

1816
01:21:21,661 --> 01:21:22,950
that might be one of them,
well,

1817
01:21:22,960 --> 01:21:24,750
you know,
there might be one that might be,

1818
01:21:24,870 --> 01:21:25,703
especially in the beginning having only 
good jokes stolen by a person who does 

1819
01:21:29,911 --> 01:21:30,744
it on television.
And then you have to watch it on comedy 

1820
01:21:32,671 --> 01:21:34,170
central a couple days later.
You're like,

1821
01:21:34,171 --> 01:21:35,004
what?
And you remember that that guy had been 

1822
01:21:36,931 --> 01:21:41,540
in the back of the room a couple of 
weeks ago and watched your act and yet.

1823
01:21:41,720 --> 01:21:42,690
And then you're like,
what?

1824
01:21:42,840 --> 01:21:43,950
Like,
you can't even believe it.

1825
01:21:44,040 --> 01:21:46,850
There's a comic and France named a Gad 
Elma lay.

1826
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:47,850
Who is he?

1827
01:21:47,850 --> 01:21:49,980
He's in New York now and he's,
he's,

1828
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,070
he works a lot in English.
He did a,

1829
01:21:52,071 --> 01:21:52,904
uh,
um,

1830
01:21:53,220 --> 01:21:54,053
he has these rumors and I'm going to say
allegedly because I don't want to get 

1831
01:21:57,460 --> 01:21:58,160
to,
don't get sued.

1832
01:21:58,160 --> 01:21:59,480
But uh,
he,

1833
01:21:59,490 --> 01:22:00,170
he,
uh,

1834
01:22:00,170 --> 01:22:02,290
I know that he,
he's taken a couple.

1835
01:22:02,820 --> 01:22:05,880
At first he took a couple bits from 
American comics,

1836
01:22:06,060 --> 01:22:06,893
then he got caught.
So he started stealing from a French 

1837
01:22:08,761 --> 01:22:12,960
Canadian comics.
And the last thing I heard he did was he

1838
01:22:12,961 --> 01:22:16,450
had this contest for open Mike 
[inaudible] and he was like,

1839
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:18,240
my next comedy tour,
uh,

1840
01:22:18,300 --> 01:22:22,050
send me your three best minutes on tape 
and the best comic.

1841
01:22:22,100 --> 01:22:22,933
I'm going to book a top and for me.
And then he started stealing from those 

1842
01:22:26,701 --> 01:22:28,820
open micros,
which is a,

1843
01:22:29,010 --> 01:22:31,590
that's such a garbage move.
It's a wacky.

1844
01:22:32,240 --> 01:22:33,180
Yeah.
Well,

1845
01:22:33,310 --> 01:22:34,320
I didn't tell them you're a good person.

1846
01:22:34,350 --> 01:22:36,110
Yeah,
I don't like it.

1847
01:22:36,130 --> 01:22:38,400
That's what I heard.
I'm not sure it's true,

1848
01:22:38,401 --> 01:22:43,020
but I saw him do a show once in,
in France and he was a like,

1849
01:22:43,050 --> 01:22:44,310
he's a rich dude.
He's,

1850
01:22:44,340 --> 01:22:48,090
he's got his own private plane and uh,
yeah,

1851
01:22:48,091 --> 01:22:49,980
he's got his own private plane.
He was,

1852
01:22:49,981 --> 01:22:50,814
he was married to the Princess of Monaco
so he's got a lot of money and he was 

1853
01:22:54,331 --> 01:22:56,630
doing,
he was doing a bit,

1854
01:22:56,650 --> 01:22:57,483
a bit like he's just a,
he was doing a bit about how he can't 

1855
01:23:00,781 --> 01:23:04,740
afford an air conditioner in this 
apartment and I was like,

1856
01:23:04,741 --> 01:23:06,070
mother,
you have

1857
01:23:06,070 --> 01:23:06,903
a kid with the princess of Monaco.
I can afford like multiple air 

1858
01:23:12,311 --> 01:23:13,990
conditioners.
Fuck you.

1859
01:23:14,620 --> 01:23:17,870
Well you know,
it's not good though.

1860
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,620
The people care like there are people do
care.

1861
01:23:20,621 --> 01:23:21,730
Some people care.
Here's the thing.

1862
01:23:21,731 --> 01:23:22,564
The problem is saying no,
they don't get sounds like paper like 

1863
01:23:27,700 --> 01:23:29,080
that.
All white people are racist.

1864
01:23:29,980 --> 01:23:31,050
You can't say it.
Yeah.

1865
01:23:31,250 --> 01:23:34,120
Like I know the whole thing in France a 
lot.

1866
01:23:34,210 --> 01:23:35,043
The new generation of French French 
comics are really angry about this and 

1867
01:23:38,381 --> 01:23:39,214
there's a guy,
there's this youtube as a channel that 

1868
01:23:41,561 --> 01:23:46,561
you talked about here when you had,
I think it was Tom Papa though is on a,

1869
01:23:46,930 --> 01:23:51,930
it's called copy comic and they take 
like bits that they'll take a bit from a

1870
01:23:52,271 --> 01:23:57,271
comic from here and then they just to 
show that what's going on.

1871
01:23:57,701 --> 01:23:58,990
But someone friends.
Yeah.

1872
01:23:59,700 --> 01:24:00,850
Just to educate them.

1873
01:24:01,600 --> 01:24:02,550
Yeah.
Um,

1874
01:24:02,551 --> 01:24:03,384
I've,
I've talked to quite a few comics from 

1875
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:09,960
countries that are bilingual that say 
this is a.

1876
01:24:09,960 --> 01:24:12,270
Montreal was very bilingual.
In fact,

1877
01:24:12,271 --> 01:24:14,250
almost everybody speaks French,
right?

1878
01:24:14,460 --> 01:24:15,293
Yeah.
Uh,

1879
01:24:15,540 --> 01:24:17,250
yeah.
Almost everybody speaks English.

1880
01:24:17,930 --> 01:24:18,763
It's like probably one of the most 
bilingual places and bought definitely 

1881
01:24:20,881 --> 01:24:21,714
in Canada,
but there's not a place like that in 

1882
01:24:22,591 --> 01:24:23,424
America.
There's no place like that in North 

1883
01:24:24,750 --> 01:24:25,583
America now.
Even thinking North American terms of 

1884
01:24:27,361 --> 01:24:28,194
United States,
like there's no place that's kind of 

1885
01:24:29,281 --> 01:24:32,680
universally speaks Spanish and English,
you know,

1886
01:24:32,710 --> 01:24:35,130
it's like some people speak English,
some people speak Spanish,

1887
01:24:35,131 --> 01:24:36,390
but very few people.
I mean,

1888
01:24:36,391 --> 01:24:37,224
you can't this the numbers.
It's never like Montreal is like 

1889
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:43,560
probably probably 80 percent speak both 
languages,

1890
01:24:43,561 --> 01:24:44,394
right?
Yeah.

1891
01:24:44,550 --> 01:24:46,950
That's crazy.
It's a beautiful city,

1892
01:24:46,951 --> 01:24:47,820
man.
It's amazing,

1893
01:24:47,850 --> 01:24:50,240
but you're fucking freedom of speech 
laws,

1894
01:24:50,340 --> 01:24:51,660
dog shit.
Fuck.

1895
01:24:51,680 --> 01:24:53,010
Fucking didn't exist.
Well,

1896
01:24:53,011 --> 01:24:53,844
that's.
You're going to create shitty art when 

1897
01:24:55,021 --> 01:24:55,770
you have that.

1898
01:24:55,770 --> 01:24:56,603
You know the way that you punish someone
who you think is doing something awful 

1899
01:25:02,431 --> 01:25:03,264
with their speech.
As long as they're not calling for 

1900
01:25:04,201 --> 01:25:05,730
someone to be murdered or something.
Right.

1901
01:25:06,090 --> 01:25:08,220
The way you do it,
as you don't go to their show,

1902
01:25:08,400 --> 01:25:10,470
you say,
I don't want to support you,

1903
01:25:11,640 --> 01:25:13,770
and then that's it.
You don't find them.

1904
01:25:14,040 --> 01:25:14,873
If enough people don't like you and your
you have a message of hate and won't 

1905
01:25:16,981 --> 01:25:17,850
come out,
you will make money.

1906
01:25:17,851 --> 01:25:18,361
You're gonna,
you're gonna.

1907
01:25:18,361 --> 01:25:20,220
Stop doing it.
That's how you kill that.

1908
01:25:20,580 --> 01:25:23,130
I definitely don't think you should have
a message of hate,

1909
01:25:23,580 --> 01:25:24,413
but I don't think that certain people 
should be able to side what's hateful 

1910
01:25:27,720 --> 01:25:29,880
because they keep pushing that boundary 
the same way.

1911
01:25:29,881 --> 01:25:33,390
They push all the other boundaries.
They'll push the boundaries of what,

1912
01:25:33,660 --> 01:25:36,270
what,
what is?

1913
01:25:36,300 --> 01:25:41,300
What's the definition of prejudice?
What's the definition of entitlement?

1914
01:25:42,481 --> 01:25:43,314
What's the definition?
You are you always coming from a place 

1915
01:25:45,211 --> 01:25:47,220
of privilege?
So are you always entitled?

1916
01:25:47,490 --> 01:25:49,260
Are you always racist?
Do you.

1917
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:50,273
I mean,
you know,

1918
01:25:50,280 --> 01:25:51,113
they have those,
they have to do this with corporations 

1919
01:25:53,250 --> 01:25:55,200
and there's no evidence that it works at
all.

1920
01:25:55,500 --> 01:25:56,333
They do unconscious bias,
like counseling or they sit down with 

1921
01:26:00,841 --> 01:26:03,560
their employees and they talked to them 
about perhaps

1922
01:26:03,980 --> 01:26:07,520
this unconscious racism they might have.
And so everybody's like,

1923
01:26:07,521 --> 01:26:08,450
fuck,
am I racist?

1924
01:26:08,600 --> 01:26:10,420
And they'd go next.
So shitty.

1925
01:26:10,421 --> 01:26:13,850
It's so crazy.
But what's crazy about it is that all it

1926
01:26:13,851 --> 01:26:18,230
is is like they needed a response to a 
perceived situation,

1927
01:26:18,231 --> 01:26:20,690
which I'm sure is the situation in many,
many places don't.

1928
01:26:20,870 --> 01:26:23,600
I'm not trying to minimalize that,
but they needed a response.

1929
01:26:23,630 --> 01:26:25,880
So the response to something totally 
unscientific,

1930
01:26:26,060 --> 01:26:26,893
not support,
but at least they can say they're doing 

1931
01:26:27,921 --> 01:26:29,610
something.
They have a,

1932
01:26:29,720 --> 01:26:32,570
you know,
racism bias training and they have these

1933
01:26:32,571 --> 01:26:35,840
people sit down and they talked to you 
about like,

1934
01:26:35,870 --> 01:26:37,520
this is what you do.
You know,

1935
01:26:37,521 --> 01:26:40,990
if a person of color walks in this,
everybody's like,

1936
01:26:41,020 --> 01:26:42,850
Chad and I want to be racist,
but it,

1937
01:26:42,950 --> 01:26:45,230
I don't think it works man,
and I don't think it's,

1938
01:26:45,400 --> 01:26:46,233
it's not the way that racism sucks and 
the way to stop racism is be a good 

1939
01:26:52,011 --> 01:26:52,550
person.

1940
01:26:52,550 --> 01:26:55,190
Yeah.
Like the more good people we have,

1941
01:26:55,260 --> 01:26:56,093
they will inspire more good people.
We will all realize that racism is 

1942
01:26:59,301 --> 01:27:03,050
fucking stupid and we should treat 
people as individuals always.

1943
01:27:03,051 --> 01:27:05,780
Whether it's by gender,
my sexual preferences,

1944
01:27:07,010 --> 01:27:09,560
origin of your,
your ancestors.

1945
01:27:09,561 --> 01:27:10,394
I don't care.
I mean I care in terms of like sexual 

1946
01:27:13,581 --> 01:27:14,640
preference,
I,

1947
01:27:14,641 --> 01:27:16,880
Karen terms of whether I think you're 
attractive or not.

1948
01:27:17,180 --> 01:27:19,160
I care in terms of like whether I 
decide,

1949
01:27:19,370 --> 01:27:20,870
you know,
the to,

1950
01:27:21,110 --> 01:27:21,943
you know,
like there's some people that want to 

1951
01:27:24,171 --> 01:27:25,004
hang out with really loud people.
There's some people that want to hang 

1952
01:27:27,681 --> 01:27:28,514
out with people that are like more 
demure or some people that are more 

1953
01:27:30,351 --> 01:27:32,330
introspect.
Everybody likes different Shit.

1954
01:27:32,420 --> 01:27:33,253
You're allowed to like different shit,
but you're not allowed to discriminate 

1955
01:27:36,831 --> 01:27:37,664
against someone and keep them from 
occupation or keep them from place to 

1956
01:27:40,551 --> 01:27:41,384
live.
And if we all thought that way and just 

1957
01:27:43,011 --> 01:27:43,844
treated people on the merits of their 
own individual personality and 

1958
01:27:46,161 --> 01:27:48,170
character,
we'd have a way better world.

1959
01:27:48,170 --> 01:27:49,003
I think we could all agree to that.
As soon as you get into these groups of 

1960
01:27:50,331 --> 01:27:53,420
all white people or all Asians are all 
like,

1961
01:27:53,450 --> 01:27:56,150
fucking come on man.
That's too small.

1962
01:27:56,210 --> 01:27:57,043
That's such a gross generalization.
It's too small of a common denominators 

1963
01:28:00,111 --> 01:28:02,630
to weird the what,
what you are like,

1964
01:28:02,631 --> 01:28:05,570
how much of what you are is where the 
fuck you're from and shit,

1965
01:28:05,571 --> 01:28:07,850
you can't control how much melanin you 
have in your skin.

1966
01:28:08,120 --> 01:28:08,953
That's ridiculous.
What you are is all the things you've 

1967
01:28:11,960 --> 01:28:15,980
experienced and all the life you've 
lived and all the lessons you've learned

1968
01:28:15,981 --> 01:28:17,960
where you are at this moment.
You know.

1969
01:28:17,961 --> 01:28:18,794
And if I like you at 30,
I might not apply to you when you were 

1970
01:28:20,481 --> 01:28:22,130
18.
You might've been fucking annoying.

1971
01:28:22,400 --> 01:28:24,050
But I meet you when you're 30.
And I'm like hey,

1972
01:28:24,051 --> 01:28:25,100
you're cool.
You know,

1973
01:28:25,101 --> 01:28:27,770
and everything's great.
And that should be okay too.

1974
01:28:27,810 --> 01:28:32,810
It's not like we have to distinguish 
between people just being not interested

1975
01:28:33,771 --> 01:28:34,604
in talking to any one individual and 
what is wrong with with gross 

1976
01:28:40,461 --> 01:28:45,461
generalizations and then tribal ideas of
like sticking to only people of European

1977
01:28:45,771 --> 01:28:49,160
ethnicity and these are the good folks 
of European descent,

1978
01:28:49,161 --> 01:28:49,994
like you're fucking crazy.
Civilization's been down that road 

1979
01:28:53,421 --> 01:28:54,254
stupid.
You can't do that shit again and you 

1980
01:28:55,731 --> 01:28:59,600
can't do it for Asians either.
You can't do it for black people.

1981
01:28:59,690 --> 01:29:00,523
You can't do it for anything.
You can't say everybody's great in this 

1982
01:29:02,761 --> 01:29:05,460
group because it's nonsense.
It's so simplistic.

1983
01:29:05,490 --> 01:29:07,170
It's not just simplistic,
it's dangerous,

1984
01:29:07,171 --> 01:29:09,390
and it also makes people scared to say 
anything about like,

1985
01:29:09,391 --> 01:29:11,190
I don't want you to think of that.
I hate the thing.

1986
01:29:11,191 --> 01:29:12,024
I left blank.
The thing I like about not censoring 

1987
01:29:14,401 --> 01:29:18,900
hate speech is if you let hateful people
say hateful things,

1988
01:29:19,080 --> 01:29:21,090
you know where the dangerous people are.

1989
01:29:21,390 --> 01:29:24,840
So if you're censoring like you can't 
use this where you can't say this.

1990
01:29:24,841 --> 01:29:25,674
You can't say that.
You don't know who the fucking Weirdos 

1991
01:29:27,631 --> 01:29:28,464
are at that hate black people.
They hate gay people that hate the 

1992
01:29:30,900 --> 01:29:33,900
translator because everyone's acting 
exactly the same.

1993
01:29:33,901 --> 01:29:37,560
Like everything's cool,
and then when they're with their friends

1994
01:29:37,570 --> 01:29:40,140
or whoever,
the people that that think like them,

1995
01:29:40,320 --> 01:29:44,190
then they're buting all their fucking 
hate and shit and garbage.

1996
01:29:44,430 --> 01:29:45,263
Well,
whenever people can express themselves 

1997
01:29:46,291 --> 01:29:47,124
freely,
there's going to be some sort of 

1998
01:29:48,301 --> 01:29:51,000
suppression and if there's some sort of 
suppression,

1999
01:29:51,180 --> 01:29:53,400
there is a resentment of that 
suppression.

2000
01:29:53,460 --> 01:29:56,330
And then there's just like this anxiety 
and this tension.

2001
01:29:56,700 --> 01:29:59,420
You know,
it's like when he would.

2002
01:29:59,430 --> 01:30:00,263
It's essentially what we're saying is 
when you think about people in business 

2003
01:30:03,691 --> 01:30:05,730
meetings,
how they're forced to communicate,

2004
01:30:06,150 --> 01:30:06,983
how this forced to address how they're 
forced to communicate that go into this 

2005
01:30:09,451 --> 01:30:11,010
very professional building.

2006
01:30:11,220 --> 01:30:14,310
All the women are dressed professional,
all the men to dress professional.

2007
01:30:14,460 --> 01:30:15,293
They all get together in these 
conference tables and everyone is 

2008
01:30:17,281 --> 01:30:18,170
agreeing.
Even those,

2009
01:30:18,360 --> 01:30:22,530
these are sexual beings who may be like 
cocaine,

2010
01:30:22,820 --> 01:30:23,890
you know,
and they,

2011
01:30:24,020 --> 01:30:25,920
they've been fucking,
you know,

2012
01:30:26,230 --> 01:30:28,690
that they,
they've,

2013
01:30:28,870 --> 01:30:33,170
they've been to music festivals and 
they've maybe been to burning man and,

2014
01:30:33,390 --> 01:30:34,223
but they're contained that contained in 
this room and they're talking about 

2015
01:30:37,621 --> 01:30:41,550
statistics and talking about 
probabilities and then someone brings up

2016
01:30:41,551 --> 01:30:42,301
diversity.
Yes.

2017
01:30:42,301 --> 01:30:43,134
Diversity,
all very important and everyone is 

2018
01:30:45,210 --> 01:30:49,470
behaving and this super weird world 
where you can't,

2019
01:30:49,471 --> 01:30:52,410
you can't move outside the box even 
remotely if you,

2020
01:30:52,411 --> 01:30:54,180
if you move outside the box even a 
little,

2021
01:30:54,181 --> 01:30:55,014
if you say you know about the guy from 
Netflix that got fired because he used 

2022
01:30:57,661 --> 01:31:00,270
the n word in a descriptive.
He was,

2023
01:31:00,480 --> 01:31:05,220
he was talking about Tom Segura special.
We're Thompson was talking about changes

2024
01:31:05,221 --> 01:31:06,054
in language and just talked about some 
words can't say anymore and he says 

2025
01:31:08,761 --> 01:31:10,290
like,
you can't say retarded.

2026
01:31:10,350 --> 01:31:11,183
He says this just because he said that 
just because he said that people were 

2027
01:31:15,181 --> 01:31:18,480
getting angry at him and protesting and 
groups.

2028
01:31:18,481 --> 01:31:21,120
We're trying to boycott Netflix,
remember?

2029
01:31:21,190 --> 01:31:23,550
Right.
So this guy,

2030
01:31:23,551 --> 01:31:24,384
I don't remember his name,
but he was one of the big wigs at 

2031
01:31:27,870 --> 01:31:28,703
Netflix and he said he was like,
it's like saying the word nigger to an 

2032
01:31:33,151 --> 01:31:37,290
African American person.
That's what it's like to say retarded to

2033
01:31:37,291 --> 01:31:39,540
a family where someone has someone who's
downstairs.

2034
01:31:39,541 --> 01:31:40,374
So he was defending,
he was talking about how offensive that 

2035
01:31:43,140 --> 01:31:44,910
word is to people.
So I was like,

2036
01:31:44,911 --> 01:31:46,200
this is the issue that we're dealing 
with.

2037
01:31:46,440 --> 01:31:48,600
So you just talked about it at a very 
matter of fact way.

2038
01:31:49,980 --> 01:31:54,980
They report him for saying the word and 
he gets fired and apparently he did this

2039
01:31:56,700 --> 01:31:57,533
twice.
This is what I've read in the same 

2040
01:31:58,950 --> 01:31:59,830
context.
Yes.

2041
01:31:59,831 --> 01:32:00,220
The same

2042
01:32:00,220 --> 01:32:02,440
exact context.
So he's repeating this thought.

2043
01:32:02,500 --> 01:32:03,333
It's basically having a.
they're doing an intellectual exercise 

2044
01:32:06,491 --> 01:32:08,260
like is this,
is it the same to you?

2045
01:32:08,380 --> 01:32:10,450
And he's saying it around African 
American people,

2046
01:32:10,760 --> 01:32:13,300
but in saying it around African American
people,

2047
01:32:13,301 --> 01:32:18,250
just the fact that he said the word 
uttered it like Abracadabra.

2048
01:32:18,460 --> 01:32:19,293
Just saying it was enough for him to 
lose his very high profile job at 

2049
01:32:22,961 --> 01:32:25,790
Netflix was apparently well liked.
And it really.

2050
01:32:26,220 --> 01:32:29,480
Do you think we're becoming like this 
because our lives are too easy?

2051
01:32:29,950 --> 01:32:34,950
That like if we had to struggle to get 
food and and protect our families,

2052
01:32:35,470 --> 01:32:39,520
we wouldn't be worried about this word 
or that word or my feelings.

2053
01:32:39,700 --> 01:32:40,780
One hundred percent.
Yeah.

2054
01:32:40,781 --> 01:32:41,860
I think we're.
We're,

2055
01:32:41,910 --> 01:32:42,743
we're seeking out altercations when we.
Because I think we're programmed for a 

2056
01:32:46,931 --> 01:32:49,690
certain amount of interaction with 
people that's unpleasant.

2057
01:32:49,880 --> 01:32:50,500
We're,
we're,

2058
01:32:50,500 --> 01:32:53,050
we're a program for a certain amount of 
competition,

2059
01:32:53,051 --> 01:32:54,640
whether it's verbal or physical.

2060
01:32:54,680 --> 01:32:55,513
We're programmed for it.
I think it's what got us to 2018 in 

2061
01:32:59,471 --> 01:33:03,610
terms of the crazy history of the human 
species is it marched across the world.

2062
01:33:03,910 --> 01:33:08,910
So imagine leaving Africa.
What woody got animal skins on your feet

2063
01:33:09,310 --> 01:33:12,400
and you're walking out.
What the fuck were those people and what

2064
01:33:12,401 --> 01:33:14,800
kind of people they encounter?
That's our ancestors.

2065
01:33:15,280 --> 01:33:16,113
Our ancestors had just been dealing with
bullshit forever and when there's no 

2066
01:33:18,731 --> 01:33:20,680
bullshit,
there's some bullshit over there.

2067
01:33:20,830 --> 01:33:23,290
There's 78 different gender pronouns 
motherfucker.

2068
01:33:23,380 --> 01:33:24,213
And the reason why you don't think so 
because you're a cis gendered white 

2069
01:33:26,471 --> 01:33:28,930
privilege piece of Shit and all white 
people are racist.

2070
01:33:29,020 --> 01:33:32,380
And then you start tweeting up a storm,
those if you go to those people's pages,

2071
01:33:32,381 --> 01:33:33,900
one of the things that I,
I'll,

2072
01:33:34,010 --> 01:33:37,210
I'll find a person who says like 
preposterous shit and if I'm not blocked

2073
01:33:37,211 --> 01:33:38,044
by them from some gigantic autoblocker,
which sometimes they do these block 

2074
01:33:41,291 --> 01:33:42,124
everybody.

2075
01:33:42,190 --> 01:33:45,910
But if someone I'm not blocked by them,
I will bookmark them.

2076
01:33:46,180 --> 01:33:48,560
So instead of like following them so 
they know I'm from,

2077
01:33:48,600 --> 01:33:50,920
I would just bookmark them so I'll just 
go back.

2078
01:33:50,950 --> 01:33:51,783
So I have a file on my computer called 
crazy motherfuckers and I will go the 

2079
01:33:54,820 --> 01:33:55,653
crazy motherfuckers page and I'll see 
them go through these manic depressive 

2080
01:33:59,321 --> 01:34:00,154
states and freak out about the world.
And then every now and then something 

2081
01:34:02,561 --> 01:34:04,630
will get tossed in there about 
relationships.

2082
01:34:04,960 --> 01:34:06,170
You know?
I mean yeah,

2083
01:34:06,580 --> 01:34:08,560
because I know,
I know it is,

2084
01:34:08,740 --> 01:34:13,740
it is harder for someone of color like a
black or Arab or you know,

2085
01:34:14,231 --> 01:34:16,780
Asian around some people around some 
people.

2086
01:34:16,781 --> 01:34:18,790
Yeah.
But saying white privilege,

2087
01:34:19,120 --> 01:34:22,330
like there are a lot of white homeless 
men.

2088
01:34:22,780 --> 01:34:24,640
And whenever I say a white homeless 
dude,

2089
01:34:24,670 --> 01:34:26,290
I always want to give them money and go 
white,

2090
01:34:26,350 --> 01:34:27,940
white privilege do.

2091
01:34:27,940 --> 01:34:28,773
There's no doubt there's an advantage in
this current climate and world to being 

2092
01:34:31,421 --> 01:34:32,254
white.
The problem is the white people are not 

2093
01:34:33,371 --> 01:34:35,620
guilty of doing anything just because 
they're privileged,

2094
01:34:35,720 --> 01:34:36,553
right?
So instead of calling it white 

2095
01:34:37,721 --> 01:34:38,554
privilege,
well we need to concentrate on is the 

2096
01:34:40,121 --> 01:34:42,700
people that are racist.
That's the only real problem.

2097
01:34:42,910 --> 01:34:43,743
The only problem is racist people.
And even though white people get 

2098
01:34:46,181 --> 01:34:50,440
discriminated against less,
the problem was saying things like black

2099
01:34:50,441 --> 01:34:55,210
people can't be racist because racism is
a power thing and bite people have power

2100
01:34:55,500 --> 01:34:57,560
over black people.
That's it's.

2101
01:34:57,610 --> 01:34:58,010
It's a

2102
01:34:58,010 --> 01:34:58,843
fucking intellectual forest.
They know it is when they're saying it 

2103
01:35:02,120 --> 01:35:05,960
and it's just one thing that they just 
repeat and you're supposed to accept it.

2104
01:35:05,961 --> 01:35:06,794
And it's a part of what we were talking 
about earlier where there's a game 

2105
01:35:08,661 --> 01:35:09,494
that's going on and the game is,
I want you to say the 78 different 

2106
01:35:12,651 --> 01:35:15,020
gender pronouns I want you to say that I
want you to do that.

2107
01:35:15,200 --> 01:35:17,540
I want you to refer to me is that I want
you to for to me is this.

2108
01:35:17,720 --> 01:35:22,040
I want you to do what I want you to do.
Once you stop using certain language,

2109
01:35:22,041 --> 01:35:25,010
I want you to start saying certain 
things because that means I win.

2110
01:35:25,290 --> 01:35:26,123
It's counterproductive because you're 
not teaching anyone how stupid it is to 

2111
01:35:29,241 --> 01:35:32,600
just discriminate based on race.
All you're doing is blocking out that.

2112
01:35:32,601 --> 01:35:33,434
Being honest.
I think that that doesn't even work 

2113
01:35:34,761 --> 01:35:35,150
anyway.

2114
01:35:35,150 --> 01:35:37,310
I think what really works is leading by 
example.

2115
01:35:37,311 --> 01:35:38,510
I think that's the only thing that 
works.

2116
01:35:38,750 --> 01:35:41,330
What I think we learned from what we've 
learned from people better than us.

2117
01:35:41,570 --> 01:35:42,403
You see someone who is amazing and she's
super smart and she's really kind to 

2118
01:35:45,021 --> 01:35:46,140
people who got,
damn it.

2119
01:35:46,141 --> 01:35:46,974
I got to be more like her.
I think that's where we're missing that 

2120
01:35:49,971 --> 01:35:52,280
aspect of it.
The chastising.

2121
01:35:52,340 --> 01:35:55,880
See this is the problem with what goes 
on with the left in particular,

2122
01:35:56,300 --> 01:36:01,300
the brutal mean assaults on people.
These twitter gangs and facebook gangs,

2123
01:36:04,011 --> 01:36:04,844
they target someone and attack them.
You are not changing anything and in 

2124
01:36:08,661 --> 01:36:09,494
fact you are going to get people who see
this horrible shit and they're going to 

2125
01:36:12,891 --> 01:36:14,090
go,
fuck those people.

2126
01:36:14,091 --> 01:36:14,924
I'm going that way,
and they go the other way and you 

2127
01:36:16,400 --> 01:36:17,233
recruit people to be on the right,
and this is literally how Donald Trump 

2128
01:36:20,061 --> 01:36:20,894
became president.

2129
01:36:21,180 --> 01:36:23,810
One of the,
one of the major factors was people were

2130
01:36:24,020 --> 01:36:28,520
noticing a trend and the trend was 
towards these crybaby,

2131
01:36:28,610 --> 01:36:32,300
preposterous liberals that call it 
everything is racist.

2132
01:36:32,301 --> 01:36:34,340
Everything is sexist.
Everything is homophobic.

2133
01:36:34,341 --> 01:36:35,174
Everything and everything falls into 
this blanket of transgression where 

2134
01:36:38,601 --> 01:36:39,434
there's no innocent and everyone's 
guilty and then when they find they run 

2135
01:36:42,351 --> 01:36:43,184
out of targets,
they go after each other for not being 

2136
01:36:44,511 --> 01:36:45,344
progressive enough to start calling each
other out to find jealousy in the 

2137
01:36:47,901 --> 01:36:48,734
movement.
That's something that really makes me 

2138
01:36:50,211 --> 01:36:51,044
happy when I see people that have been 
calling people out for years and then 

2139
01:36:54,681 --> 01:36:56,190
they get caught out and I'm like,
fuck,

2140
01:36:56,330 --> 01:36:57,290
finally.
Well,

2141
01:36:57,370 --> 01:37:00,260
you know,
I've seen it happen.

2142
01:37:00,830 --> 01:37:01,663
I've seen it.
I've seen it happen with people I've 

2143
01:37:03,441 --> 01:37:05,540
seen.
I've seen them become.

2144
01:37:06,950 --> 01:37:07,783
Jamie Kilstein is a friend of mine and 
Jamie Kilstein was at one point in his 

2145
01:37:11,301 --> 01:37:16,240
life this really progressive activist 
guy who was like,

2146
01:37:16,250 --> 01:37:17,083
everything he said had to be like super 
male feminists and super trans positive 

2147
01:37:20,931 --> 01:37:24,080
and I mean he was trying so hard to be 
accepted but,

2148
01:37:24,081 --> 01:37:25,700
but he's super honest about it too.

2149
01:37:25,700 --> 01:37:27,410
He's done a podcast about it and you 
know,

2150
01:37:27,411 --> 01:37:30,920
he'd call people out and be really mean 
and really vicious.

2151
01:37:31,010 --> 01:37:32,930
And then he realized he was getting all 
this anxiety from it.

2152
01:37:32,931 --> 01:37:35,820
He had to check his twitter all day.
He'd be walking the street,

2153
01:37:35,821 --> 01:37:38,030
just couldn't stop,
like checking his twitter,

2154
01:37:38,031 --> 01:37:39,560
see what their replies were.
And he was released.

2155
01:37:39,710 --> 01:37:43,130
He was caught in this weird fucking hate
spiral,

2156
01:37:43,340 --> 01:37:44,980
you know,
even though he was proporting,

2157
01:37:45,350 --> 01:37:46,183
he was acting on the premise that he was
a good person and he was going to call 

2158
01:37:48,861 --> 01:37:49,694
out all these bad people,
but he was like addicted to this 

2159
01:37:51,321 --> 01:37:53,090
weirdness.
And then it turned on him.

2160
01:37:53,340 --> 01:37:54,173
It turned on him like some girls accused
him of being creepy and it was like 

2161
01:37:57,950 --> 01:37:58,783
super minor,
like trying to go on dates with people 

2162
01:38:01,300 --> 01:38:03,570
like just.
But that was enough that it all you need

2163
01:38:03,571 --> 01:38:06,480
is like one in that world,
every in that world,

2164
01:38:06,510 --> 01:38:07,343
everyone is so hyper progressive and 
looking for any sort of deviation from 

2165
01:38:12,091 --> 01:38:15,540
the pattern they can attack and they 
just decided that this guy,

2166
01:38:15,541 --> 01:38:18,940
even though he had been like this model 
ally for,

2167
01:38:19,020 --> 01:38:19,853
for a male as a male feminist and for 
people of color and gay stood for 

2168
01:38:24,901 --> 01:38:25,880
everything that they wanted to.

2169
01:38:25,940 --> 01:38:29,270
He's a piece of garbage because he's 
heterosexual,

2170
01:38:29,800 --> 01:38:30,750
you know,
and you know,

2171
01:38:30,800 --> 01:38:32,730
apparently he worked with this girl or 
something like that,

2172
01:38:32,731 --> 01:38:33,564
but whatever it was,
I mean it was the most minor of 

2173
01:38:35,821 --> 01:38:37,010
transgressions.
There was no rape,

2174
01:38:37,020 --> 01:38:37,853
no touching,
no,

2175
01:38:37,950 --> 01:38:39,900
no meanness know,
like.

2176
01:38:40,250 --> 01:38:44,770
And so after all this was done,
he came out on the other end and that it

2177
01:38:44,820 --> 01:38:48,690
needed just came clean about like how he
felt while he was doing it.

2178
01:38:48,691 --> 01:38:51,210
Why did.
It was very brave that he did that.

2179
01:38:51,211 --> 01:38:55,230
But it gives you insight to a lot of 
like what is one of the problems of this

2180
01:38:55,231 --> 01:38:56,064
unnavigable territory of social media is
that it's very compelling to engage 

2181
01:39:00,060 --> 01:39:03,170
constantly and consistently with people 
in this,

2182
01:39:03,900 --> 01:39:04,733
this really anxiety ridden wave of 
animosity that's going to run back and 

2183
01:39:09,601 --> 01:39:11,430
forth between the two of you for no 
reason.

2184
01:39:11,431 --> 01:39:13,080
Most of the time for no reason

2185
01:39:13,270 --> 01:39:14,710
was free.
The Nipple,

2186
01:39:14,800 --> 01:39:15,910
a big thing here.

2187
01:39:16,920 --> 01:39:19,610
There was more New York like a lot of 
gals were.

2188
01:39:19,710 --> 01:39:20,543
They decided they were going to protest,
that men can be topless but they can be 

2189
01:39:23,911 --> 01:39:25,200
topless and they passed that right?

2190
01:39:25,220 --> 01:39:26,053
I,
I had a friend that she was telling me 

2191
01:39:27,180 --> 01:39:29,700
and we had this conversation and she was
like,

2192
01:39:29,850 --> 01:39:32,460
no,
but like a female female,

2193
01:39:32,461 --> 01:39:35,220
breasts aren't sexual,
so I should be allowed to shop.

2194
01:39:35,370 --> 01:39:36,203
And I was like,
look,

2195
01:39:36,330 --> 01:39:38,850
you know that I know that my penis 
doesn't know.

2196
01:39:39,420 --> 01:39:43,440
I'm sorry if I see tits.
My Dick is going to get hard.

2197
01:39:43,530 --> 01:39:46,710
I'm sorry.
It's not like I respect you,

2198
01:39:46,711 --> 01:39:48,840
but if,
if you fucking pull your tits out,

2199
01:39:49,020 --> 01:39:52,010
my Dick is going to get hard.
We get,

2200
01:39:53,740 --> 01:39:54,890
we do.
We do for you,

2201
01:39:54,900 --> 01:39:55,910
we were animals,
but you know,

2202
01:39:55,930 --> 01:39:58,050
it's also that we're just not used to 
seeing tits.

2203
01:39:58,320 --> 01:40:00,090
Yeah.
If tits were out all the time,

2204
01:40:00,120 --> 01:40:02,990
they were actually get used to it.
The problem is changing gears.

2205
01:40:03,630 --> 01:40:05,550
Look at those people in that fucking 
dead island.

2206
01:40:05,810 --> 01:40:08,990
They have weird tits.
Tits.

2207
01:40:09,090 --> 01:40:14,090
Someone needs to tell them they need 
nice west coast to the west coast.

2208
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:15,960
Yeah.
I don't know man.

2209
01:40:16,850 --> 01:40:18,240
I think they should be able to do it 
though.

2210
01:40:18,270 --> 01:40:19,103
They want to walk around topless,
but the problem is there's too many 

2211
01:40:21,560 --> 01:40:22,610
dickheads.
You're.

2212
01:40:22,620 --> 01:40:25,500
You're running into a river of 
dickheads.

2213
01:40:25,630 --> 01:40:28,200
You're going to try to go upstream 
through that with her tits hanging out.

2214
01:40:28,440 --> 01:40:30,510
That's fucking true.
You go to a bar,

2215
01:40:30,630 --> 01:40:32,420
if you want to go to a bar top lists 
like,

2216
01:40:32,490 --> 01:40:33,323
look,
that is chaos that's going off the 

2217
01:40:35,371 --> 01:40:36,031
rails.
Yeah,

2218
01:40:36,031 --> 01:40:39,810
you definitely should be able to do it,
but I don't think you should.

2219
01:40:40,130 --> 01:40:41,580
If you were my friend.
Like I said,

2220
01:40:41,581 --> 01:40:43,830
if in an ideal world should be able to,
yes,

2221
01:40:44,190 --> 01:40:46,540
you should definitely be able to,
but do I think you should do it?

2222
01:40:46,590 --> 01:40:47,910
No,
no,

2223
01:40:47,911 --> 01:40:49,740
don't do that.
People are going to try to suck them.

2224
01:40:50,110 --> 01:40:53,400
They're going to try to grab them.
It's like it's.

2225
01:40:53,430 --> 01:40:53,980
If someone's going

2226
01:40:53,980 --> 01:40:55,370
to touch your tits,
it's good.

2227
01:40:55,390 --> 01:40:56,223
It's so rare.
You have to be in the perfect bar in 

2228
01:40:58,901 --> 01:41:00,190
Asheville,
North Carolina,

2229
01:41:00,410 --> 01:41:01,243
and you can be there from 10 to two and 
nobody will touch your tits like one 

2230
01:41:03,071 --> 01:41:05,320
place.
Someone's gonna touch your tits.

2231
01:41:05,350 --> 01:41:06,183
People are gross.

2232
01:41:06,280 --> 01:41:07,113
Like even even when girls,
Ariana Grande Grande's sang at aretha 

2233
01:41:10,070 --> 01:41:10,903
Franklin's funeral.
Even that preacher tried to touch her 

2234
01:41:13,170 --> 01:41:15,700
test.
He was going to grip.

2235
01:41:15,760 --> 01:41:16,593
Yeah.
So imagine if she had freed the nipple 

2236
01:41:18,910 --> 01:41:21,400
fucking crazy.
He would have gotten who'd got pregnant.

2237
01:41:23,720 --> 01:41:24,553
But there's,
there's no argument in saying that they 

2238
01:41:26,691 --> 01:41:27,950
shouldn't do that.
Right?

2239
01:41:27,951 --> 01:41:28,784
It shouldn't be a law.
This is almost like mean you can make 

2240
01:41:31,491 --> 01:41:36,491
parallels to compelled speech because I 
don't think that you should be naked and

2241
01:41:37,971 --> 01:41:39,620
just walk down the street if you're a 
girl,

2242
01:41:40,680 --> 01:41:41,513
but you should be allowed.
I don't think you should if you're my 

2243
01:41:42,681 --> 01:41:44,600
friend because I would say,
listen,

2244
01:41:44,601 --> 01:41:45,434
you're going to get harassed.
It's is way more likely that you'll get 

2245
01:41:49,041 --> 01:41:50,870
raped,
I would think.

2246
01:41:51,250 --> 01:41:52,160
I mean,
I'd like to know what the,

2247
01:41:52,580 --> 01:41:53,413
I don't want to do a study,
but I would like to know what the 

2248
01:41:55,590 --> 01:42:00,050
statistics look just make,
make these people get raped,

2249
01:42:00,080 --> 01:42:04,880
like just walk around for four of our 
subjects,

2250
01:42:04,881 --> 01:42:06,650
got raped.
You don't want,

2251
01:42:06,651 --> 01:42:09,020
don't want to do that study.
But um,

2252
01:42:10,100 --> 01:42:10,933
I think um,
if you live in a tribe like that 

2253
01:42:13,100 --> 01:42:13,933
uncontacted tribe outside of India,
they're probably super accustomed to 

2254
01:42:16,851 --> 01:42:19,400
seeing people naked and it's,
they probably act normal.

2255
01:42:19,670 --> 01:42:22,370
It's probably not that big a deal where 
we're,

2256
01:42:22,470 --> 01:42:23,390
you know,
it's like,

2257
01:42:24,020 --> 01:42:26,420
what's in the box man?
What's in the box?

2258
01:42:26,720 --> 01:42:27,553
And we will cover everything up.
But the buys are all covered up or feed 

2259
01:42:29,661 --> 01:42:30,130
or whatever.

2260
01:42:30,130 --> 01:42:32,400
Remember,
remember when we were young,

2261
01:42:32,750 --> 01:42:33,583
like I'd see just a sears catalog,
a woman in a bra and I jerk off and now 

2262
01:42:40,920 --> 01:42:41,753
like it desensitized.
You start watching porn and then you're 

2263
01:42:45,421 --> 01:42:46,171
like,
oh fuck.

2264
01:42:46,171 --> 01:42:49,980
If someone had Mascara running,
it's not gagging.

2265
01:42:50,010 --> 01:42:53,780
It's,
there isn't at least one murder in this.

2266
01:42:54,960 --> 01:42:58,640
How can I get hard?
Watch an action movie and nobody dies in

2267
01:42:58,660 --> 01:43:00,900
a bitch ass movies this.
But we're Weirdos.

2268
01:43:00,901 --> 01:43:01,734
And everybody has their own weird quirk.
It's I think a lot of times we don't 

2269
01:43:06,181 --> 01:43:09,900
admit it or we then you see someone who 
an extreme and you're like,

2270
01:43:09,901 --> 01:43:10,734
oh fuck.
At least I'm out that like we have an 

2271
01:43:11,131 --> 01:43:15,270
intern for for our podcast and he's hard
to gold.

2272
01:43:15,300 --> 01:43:16,133
Right?
But he has a crippling addiction of 

2273
01:43:17,541 --> 01:43:20,340
prostitutes and just a weird guy,
like when you meet him,

2274
01:43:20,341 --> 01:43:22,160
he's just a fucking over the top.
Weird.

2275
01:43:22,190 --> 01:43:23,640
Is it crippling because you can't afford
it.

2276
01:43:23,730 --> 01:43:26,490
He's a weird.
But he just said bad judge of character.

2277
01:43:26,670 --> 01:43:27,503
So He.
He picks all hookers that will steal 

2278
01:43:30,931 --> 01:43:33,030
money.
He got robbed the other day.

2279
01:43:33,060 --> 01:43:35,280
We've been here for two days.
He was robbed and pepper sprayed.

2280
01:43:38,410 --> 01:43:42,220
She made a documentary on this guy.
We're going to talk about it for awhile.

2281
01:43:42,240 --> 01:43:43,073
Pro on this motherfucker.
You can get that party role and that's 

2282
01:43:45,420 --> 01:43:47,820
what you do.
You blur out faces and watch.

2283
01:43:47,910 --> 01:43:49,290
What's his name?
Poseidon.

2284
01:43:49,440 --> 01:43:52,010
Poseidon gets his ass kicked by the name
of the name of

2285
01:43:52,010 --> 01:43:52,843
the documentary.
And it'd be your version of the naked 

2286
01:43:54,891 --> 01:43:57,100
woman walking around trying to knock it,
right?

2287
01:43:57,520 --> 01:43:59,510
Yeah.
The way he told the story,

2288
01:43:59,511 --> 01:44:00,990
like he was like,
he,

2289
01:44:01,170 --> 01:44:03,080
he talked to this woman and we were 
like,

2290
01:44:03,620 --> 01:44:06,320
that's not a real picture.
You're the shit you're going to get.

2291
01:44:06,590 --> 01:44:09,320
She's going to steal,
she's going to steal all your shit.

2292
01:44:09,321 --> 01:44:09,820
And he was like,
no,

2293
01:44:09,820 --> 01:44:10,760
no,
I think she's real.

2294
01:44:10,761 --> 01:44:12,190
I think she's real.
Or like,

2295
01:44:12,210 --> 01:44:13,220
oh,
she's not real.

2296
01:44:13,221 --> 01:44:16,850
And then she came over to the house when
we were doing a spot at the,

2297
01:44:16,851 --> 01:44:18,250
at the store.
And uh,

2298
01:44:18,350 --> 01:44:20,750
she,
she told them it's 300,

2299
01:44:20,751 --> 01:44:21,584
he gave her $300.
Then he tried to touch her and she was 

2300
01:44:23,061 --> 01:44:23,321
like,
no,

2301
01:44:23,321 --> 01:44:24,710
no,
it's 300 just to meet,

2302
01:44:24,950 --> 01:44:28,540
we need more money.
And then they went out to a,

2303
01:44:28,580 --> 01:44:30,760
like an ATM.
He got more money,

2304
01:44:30,770 --> 01:44:32,610
gave her the money,
she brought it.

2305
01:44:32,840 --> 01:44:36,860
She went back to the apartment and then 
he pulled the Dick and she was like,

2306
01:44:36,861 --> 01:44:38,540
no,
we're not having sex.

2307
01:44:38,990 --> 01:44:40,250
And then he was like,
what?

2308
01:44:40,251 --> 01:44:41,084
And then she,
she ran away and pepper sprayed or like 

2309
01:44:42,441 --> 01:44:43,850
she ran it,
he was still making it.

2310
01:44:43,880 --> 01:44:44,713
So he said I tried to chase her,
but she was fast in the hills and 

2311
01:44:47,290 --> 01:44:48,123
there's two flights of stairs and he 
slipped on the last ones because he has 

2312
01:44:50,391 --> 01:44:53,240
his boxer shorts and as soon as he stood
up from the slip,

2313
01:44:53,360 --> 01:44:55,700
she sprayed him in the face.
She ran out,

2314
01:44:55,730 --> 01:44:59,690
he ran three floors up to get dressed.
And then you went out looking for her.

2315
01:44:59,930 --> 01:45:02,450
But he's not gonna find finer.
And then he shows up at the store.

2316
01:45:02,451 --> 01:45:05,420
Belligerent.
And was he naked when she pepper sprayed

2317
01:45:05,421 --> 01:45:05,960
him?
Yeah.

2318
01:45:05,960 --> 01:45:06,920
Yeah.
Uh,

2319
01:45:07,290 --> 01:45:08,150
well,
from what he told us,

2320
01:45:08,151 --> 01:45:09,560
his boxers were stuck on his foot.

2321
01:45:09,590 --> 01:45:10,050
What?
When,

2322
01:45:10,050 --> 01:45:12,080
when he told us a story,
we were like,

2323
01:45:12,110 --> 01:45:14,240
I get,
I get why she pepper sprayed you.

2324
01:45:14,450 --> 01:45:15,660
Cause you're like,
he's a,

2325
01:45:15,830 --> 01:45:16,880
like,
he's a big dude.

2326
01:45:17,090 --> 01:45:19,760
And Poseidon is like fucking like 300 
pounds,

2327
01:45:19,761 --> 01:45:23,330
six five.
And she's a singer.

2328
01:45:23,990 --> 01:45:28,700
She's got a guy that's like 350 pounds 
with a rock hard dick going,

2329
01:45:29,320 --> 01:45:32,040
you fucking whore.
He was yelling.

2330
01:45:32,080 --> 01:45:33,950
I know him.
So he definitely said that.

2331
01:45:34,070 --> 01:45:37,250
And we were worried because the airbnb 
that the owner lives right behind.

2332
01:45:37,290 --> 01:45:38,930
And she's very nosy,
she's nosy bitch.

2333
01:45:39,080 --> 01:45:40,940
She keeps looking at what we're doing.
So I'm like fuck,

2334
01:45:40,941 --> 01:45:42,350
she's hearing this.
And she said,

2335
01:45:42,620 --> 01:45:44,240
be quiet.
No glitter in the house,

2336
01:45:44,241 --> 01:45:47,760
like weird rules litter.
And I think we broke every rule,

2337
01:45:47,800 --> 01:45:51,200
environmental person saying you 
shouldn't use glitter anymore.

2338
01:45:51,380 --> 01:45:52,820
It gets to the fish.
Oh,

2339
01:45:52,821 --> 01:45:55,190
is that why she said the ocean?
Because we didn't know why.

2340
01:45:55,270 --> 01:45:56,330
It was like,
what?

2341
01:45:56,331 --> 01:45:59,570
No glitter.
Like who asks like,

2342
01:45:59,810 --> 01:46:03,500
why am I was like you walk,
you litter off the glitter goes into the

2343
01:46:03,501 --> 01:46:05,190
drain.
But glitter adventure,

2344
01:46:05,200 --> 01:46:06,920
he gets into the water.
Why would,

2345
01:46:06,950 --> 01:46:10,010
like I told her we're going to be three 
dudes renting the apartment.

2346
01:46:10,250 --> 01:46:15,250
Why would we bring glitter?
Or maybe this is la.

2347
01:46:15,291 --> 01:46:16,124
Yeah,
no man.

2348
01:46:16,130 --> 01:46:18,290
You were gone on before about you.
Not.

2349
01:46:18,350 --> 01:46:21,110
It's impossible for you to be a gay guy.
You definitely could have been gay guy,

2350
01:46:23,600 --> 01:46:28,190
a gay burlesque.
But even if I was a gay guy,

2351
01:46:28,390 --> 01:46:31,160
like I wouldn't.
I wouldn't be a gay guy,

2352
01:46:31,370 --> 01:46:33,400
I don't think would bro.
Man,

2353
01:46:33,410 --> 01:46:34,710
high heels,
fishing nets,

2354
01:46:34,730 --> 01:46:36,430
glitter.
He'd go hard.

2355
01:46:36,950 --> 01:46:37,783
Hard.
And you'd have like some old timey 

2356
01:46:41,271 --> 01:46:45,950
clothes onto like a Charlie Chaplin Gay 
guy like Sherlock Holmes.

2357
01:46:47,110 --> 01:46:47,721
Yeah,
man.

2358
01:46:47,721 --> 01:46:48,590
Old Timey,
Charlie,

2359
01:46:48,680 --> 01:46:49,920
Charlie Chaplin,
gay stuff.

2360
01:46:49,980 --> 01:46:52,710
You know how,
how hard it must have been in those days

2361
01:46:52,711 --> 01:46:55,770
to be gay.
Like coming out of the closet now.

2362
01:46:55,980 --> 01:47:00,270
It's still hard in small towns.
But imagine already even in big cities,

2363
01:47:00,271 --> 01:47:02,250
man.
Depends on your friend's parents.

2364
01:47:02,410 --> 01:47:06,030
Yeah.
Yeah man.

2365
01:47:06,330 --> 01:47:07,770
Charlie Chaplin.
Days Imagine.

2366
01:47:08,270 --> 01:47:10,620
But there's probably a lot of gang shit 
going on.

2367
01:47:10,830 --> 01:47:12,990
Like I don't think there's any 
difference in the number.

2368
01:47:13,140 --> 01:47:14,950
I bet the numbers probably sound like 
this.

2369
01:47:15,270 --> 01:47:17,040
It's exactly the same.
I'm sure.

2370
01:47:17,310 --> 01:47:18,143
Yeah.
Cause even now people are saying now 

2371
01:47:19,750 --> 01:47:22,000
there are more,
there are more transit in the weather,

2372
01:47:22,040 --> 01:47:25,020
but there are more that are getting 
operations.

2373
01:47:25,080 --> 01:47:27,480
But in the old days it was the same 
thing.

2374
01:47:27,570 --> 01:47:29,250
I'm sure.
Yeah.

2375
01:47:29,340 --> 01:47:32,410
I bet the numbers consistent.
Probably the percentage.

2376
01:47:32,411 --> 01:47:35,070
It's probably more numbers now because 
there's more people.

2377
01:47:35,700 --> 01:47:36,533
There were probably a bunch of gay dudes
from the fifties that were actually 

2378
01:47:40,111 --> 01:47:43,530
trans women,
but just because you couldn't get,

2379
01:47:44,660 --> 01:47:47,280
you couldn't change anything,
so you just suck Dick,

2380
01:47:47,640 --> 01:47:49,470
you know,
in private or whatever.

2381
01:47:49,590 --> 01:47:54,510
This is science.
I'm a scientist book on this.

2382
01:47:54,730 --> 01:47:59,730
Got a deep passion for this information.
So you guys are on compound media.

2383
01:48:00,720 --> 01:48:03,120
It's called a.
it's called and drink minimum.

2384
01:48:03,121 --> 01:48:05,460
We do shows.
Do you have two drinks?

2385
01:48:05,461 --> 01:48:08,150
And every show will have more than we 
do.

2386
01:48:08,210 --> 01:48:09,690
Always have two drink minimum.
Yeah.

2387
01:48:09,760 --> 01:48:12,570
And we do have done a one drink show.
No,

2388
01:48:12,690 --> 01:48:15,030
but we do,
we do one shots which are,

2389
01:48:15,031 --> 01:48:19,020
we do free episodes,
like just on itunes once a week,

2390
01:48:19,410 --> 01:48:20,243
30 minute show.
And then on Fridays we do the two hour 

2391
01:48:22,471 --> 01:48:26,350
show on compound media and it's just a 
compound mediums,

2392
01:48:26,351 --> 01:48:29,820
which is a nd Anthony Kumi is a thing.
And Anthony,

2393
01:48:29,821 --> 01:48:32,610
um,
he's so fucking funny.

2394
01:48:32,611 --> 01:48:34,620
He's a genius.
He most people know him.

2395
01:48:34,760 --> 01:48:36,590
He's such a wild man too.
So crazy.

2396
01:48:36,600 --> 01:48:37,950
And Anthony,
if it wasn't open,

2397
01:48:37,951 --> 01:48:41,430
anthony wasn't for open.
Anthony podcast wouldn't exist.

2398
01:48:41,460 --> 01:48:43,380
Like the format podcasting.

2399
01:48:44,430 --> 01:48:47,390
Every and now they're really good.
Podcast,

2400
01:48:47,391 --> 01:48:49,350
but the first couple of years of 
podcasts,

2401
01:48:49,351 --> 01:48:51,300
like 2006,
seven,

2402
01:48:51,301 --> 01:48:52,134
whatever,
most podcasts sounded like shitty 

2403
01:48:54,061 --> 01:48:57,270
versions of Opie and Anthony and now 
like,

2404
01:48:57,320 --> 01:48:58,153
like was ones that we're trying to do 
like an hour long interview style 

2405
01:49:02,431 --> 01:49:04,400
podcast.
It was more like a,

2406
01:49:04,401 --> 01:49:05,234
you know,
some npr type deal or something like 

2407
01:49:06,511 --> 01:49:08,190
that.
And then um,

2408
01:49:09,120 --> 01:49:10,440
we started doing,
um,

2409
01:49:10,740 --> 01:49:13,290
where there would be like a lot of 
comics just hanging around,

2410
01:49:13,320 --> 01:49:16,860
hanging out and when,
when we started doing those,

2411
01:49:17,040 --> 01:49:17,873
which was like 2009 ish,
that was clearly influenced by opie and 

2412
01:49:22,921 --> 01:49:27,921
anthony and also influenced even more so
by Anthony Kumi is Internet show that he

2413
01:49:28,081 --> 01:49:29,800
was doing last compound show?
Yeah.

2414
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:30,833
Yeah,
because I watched that and this is one 

2415
01:49:32,551 --> 01:49:36,150
of the big things that hit me because I 
realized I could do it because um,

2416
01:49:36,240 --> 01:49:37,860
he just set it up in his basement.

2417
01:49:38,180 --> 01:49:38,620
I mean,
he,

2418
01:49:38,620 --> 01:49:39,453
he had some money and he decided to make
a green screen and you've got these 

2419
01:49:42,270 --> 01:49:43,103
professional cameras.
And then I thought about it while I was 

2420
01:49:44,851 --> 01:49:45,601
watching them.
I was like,

2421
01:49:45,601 --> 01:49:46,710
why don't I do that?
I'm like,

2422
01:49:46,711 --> 01:49:47,544
why am not doing that?
Like he's got this whole setup in his 

2423
01:49:49,211 --> 01:49:50,044
basement and then there was this one 
time where he was drunk doing karaoke 

2424
01:49:54,040 --> 01:49:56,770
with a machine gun as,
as you get a machine gun,

2425
01:49:56,800 --> 01:49:57,633
any sig,
and he's doing karaoke and I remember 

2426
01:50:00,221 --> 01:50:02,710
thinking like this crazy motherfucker I 
need to,

2427
01:50:03,070 --> 01:50:03,903
I need to do a show now.
I need to because now I'm saying this 

2428
01:50:07,061 --> 01:50:07,894
would be a lot of fun and I always 
enjoyed doing radio shows when I did 

2429
01:50:10,360 --> 01:50:11,830
them.
I would do.

2430
01:50:11,831 --> 01:50:12,664
I'm like,
I would do opie and anthony even if I 

2431
01:50:13,871 --> 01:50:18,871
didn't have like tickets to sell,
even if it was all sold out,

2432
01:50:20,350 --> 01:50:23,380
I would still show up and go hang out 
with those guys because it was just fun.

2433
01:50:23,380 --> 01:50:26,380
Like a comic's table.
Like it was just hanging out.

2434
01:50:26,590 --> 01:50:28,480
Just break them both.
I like this.

2435
01:50:28,850 --> 01:50:30,940
I mean like we're doing right now.
That's how it happened.

2436
01:50:31,080 --> 01:50:31,913
You know,
I'm doing it with those guys and 

2437
01:50:32,741 --> 01:50:36,130
watching anthony do it on his own and 
becoming friends with Jimmy,

2438
01:50:36,570 --> 01:50:37,403
you know?
And then seeing how it's fun to just 

2439
01:50:40,361 --> 01:50:41,194
hang out with comics.
You did Anthony show a couple of weeks 

2440
01:50:44,050 --> 01:50:44,591
ago,
couple weeks ago,

2441
01:50:44,591 --> 01:50:45,424
but it hasn't aired yet.
I don't think it's holding on to it to 

2442
01:50:46,931 --> 01:50:48,100
next week when he's,
uh,

2443
01:50:48,160 --> 01:50:50,420
he's actually going to be here because 
the third is,

2444
01:50:50,421 --> 01:50:51,870
is new sidekick.
Uh,

2445
01:50:52,060 --> 01:50:56,620
Dave Landau is fucking insanely funny.
He's really,

2446
01:50:56,621 --> 01:50:59,120
really,
really funny comic.

2447
01:50:59,380 --> 01:51:00,213
Yeah.
He's a comic from Detroit who now now 

2448
01:51:02,531 --> 01:51:07,210
lives in New York and I didn't know him.
And like every,

2449
01:51:07,240 --> 01:51:10,600
all of the open anthony fans were like,
fuck,

2450
01:51:10,790 --> 01:51:11,670
why?
Why didn't he,

2451
01:51:11,690 --> 01:51:12,250
I have Jamie.

2452
01:51:12,250 --> 01:51:14,240
Why doesn't he have Jimmy?
Why doesn't he have a.

2453
01:51:14,320 --> 01:51:15,630
Why doesn't,
why doesn't own,

2454
01:51:15,670 --> 01:51:18,870
ain't get back together.
But Dave Landau and grant money.

2455
01:51:18,970 --> 01:51:19,751
You Go,
okay,

2456
01:51:19,751 --> 01:51:21,650
this works.
This is a very good company.

2457
01:51:21,730 --> 01:51:23,140
Really good show.
Yeah.

2458
01:51:23,141 --> 01:51:25,360
He's a super nice guy too.
First Smart Dude.

2459
01:51:25,750 --> 01:51:27,400
And um,
their setup is great.

2460
01:51:27,401 --> 01:51:28,234
You know,
the green screen behind them just turns 

2461
01:51:29,561 --> 01:51:31,180
it into whatever the fuck he wants it to
be.

2462
01:51:31,690 --> 01:51:36,690
And He's got a little stadium seating.
So all the weird people.

2463
01:51:36,770 --> 01:51:39,670
So something fun though about when his 
shell,

2464
01:51:39,690 --> 01:51:40,523
like the first couple of times I did his
show when it was in the basement of his 

2465
01:51:43,061 --> 01:51:43,894
house.
There's something I like about doing 

2466
01:51:45,341 --> 01:51:46,630
those shows when you're,
you're,

2467
01:51:46,750 --> 01:51:50,530
you go into someone's house.
Like I did Steven crowder show,

2468
01:51:50,620 --> 01:51:53,050
uh,
like a month ago and there was something

2469
01:51:53,051 --> 01:51:57,930
cool about going in the suburbs of 
Dallas in his garage to do his show.

2470
01:51:57,940 --> 01:51:59,180
Supposed to say where he lives,
man.

2471
01:51:59,250 --> 01:52:00,280
Guys hiding.
No,

2472
01:52:00,281 --> 01:52:01,800
but yeah.
But tell us.

2473
01:52:02,260 --> 01:52:06,340
I'm sorry.
I even crowder dies my fault.

2474
01:52:07,220 --> 01:52:09,580
I was getting blamed tooth moved around 
a lot.

2475
01:52:09,581 --> 01:52:10,301
Yeah.
No,

2476
01:52:10,301 --> 01:52:11,081
I know y'all.
Yeah,

2477
01:52:11,081 --> 01:52:11,914
that's true.
But remember he did that a thing that 

2478
01:52:13,271 --> 01:52:17,780
Bob Ross Paints Muhammad to.
I took ball.

2479
01:52:17,940 --> 01:52:18,773
Yeah.
I mean it's literally something that 

2480
01:52:20,501 --> 01:52:23,770
they're allowed to kill you if you do.
And he did that allowed.

2481
01:52:23,970 --> 01:52:27,970
Yeah,
I mean it's strange time.

2482
01:52:28,060 --> 01:52:30,460
I mean this is a,
also a time where that,

2483
01:52:30,580 --> 01:52:31,413
criticizing that,
criticizing anything that's Islamic is 

2484
01:52:33,881 --> 01:52:34,714
very dangerous because people call you 
Islamophobic and because people want to 

2485
01:52:37,841 --> 01:52:38,674
kill you.
So we've got two different things going 

2486
01:52:39,611 --> 01:52:40,444
on at the same time.
But those same people will have no 

2487
01:52:42,611 --> 01:52:44,390
problem mocking Christians.
I am.

2488
01:52:44,560 --> 01:52:45,393
Yeah.
Yeah.

2489
01:52:45,440 --> 01:52:46,040
I'm,
I'm

2490
01:52:46,040 --> 01:52:48,140
not even like,
I'm not a right wing guy.

2491
01:52:48,141 --> 01:52:50,300
I consider myself a little more to the 
left,

2492
01:52:50,660 --> 01:52:54,170
but there's something I like about right
wing media,

2493
01:52:54,830 --> 01:52:55,663
especially like the funny type of right 
wing media that they take fucking crazy 

2494
01:52:59,991 --> 01:53:01,410
risks.
You mean like Kumina,

2495
01:53:01,510 --> 01:53:02,540
like,
like Kumina,

2496
01:53:02,550 --> 01:53:04,400
like crowder,
like A.

2497
01:53:04,400 --> 01:53:05,233
Steven crowder is really funny to like 
Gavin McInnes I think is fucking 

2498
01:53:08,031 --> 01:53:08,830
hilarious.

2499
01:53:08,830 --> 01:53:12,610
Gavin's in the crossfire and right now 
is the eye of Sauron is upon him.

2500
01:53:12,930 --> 01:53:16,810
He's too much stupid shit about inciting
violence.

2501
01:53:16,811 --> 01:53:21,270
And now that there's some articles 
saying that the FBI considers him a,

2502
01:53:21,280 --> 01:53:22,113
that the proud boys are hate group.
But then Kumina sent me something that 

2503
01:53:26,050 --> 01:53:29,050
he sent him and I'll send it to you.
He's saying it's

2504
01:53:29,140 --> 01:53:29,973
bullshit.
The first time I heard about the proud 

2505
01:53:31,891 --> 01:53:35,810
boys I was doing Gavin shown New York 
and uh,

2506
01:53:35,850 --> 01:53:37,920
he,
he was with a Dante narrow,

2507
01:53:38,070 --> 01:53:40,800
which is a,
a black comic in New York.

2508
01:53:40,980 --> 01:53:42,120
And he was like,
Hey,

2509
01:53:42,121 --> 01:53:42,954
uh,
the,

2510
01:53:43,030 --> 01:53:44,760
uh,
me and him are in the proud boys.

2511
01:53:44,761 --> 01:53:46,950
And I was like,
what the fuck's the proud boys holding?

2512
01:53:47,260 --> 01:53:50,220
Let's explain what it actually is.
Because a joke,

2513
01:53:50,280 --> 01:53:52,740
at first it was like,
we don't jerk off,

2514
01:53:52,890 --> 01:53:53,723
so the will want to fuck our wives.
And then like four months later I was 

2515
01:53:57,211 --> 01:53:57,720
like,
oh

2516
01:53:57,720 --> 01:54:01,040
Gavin McInnes quit the proud boys today.
Well,

2517
01:54:01,090 --> 01:54:01,650
you know,

2518
01:54:01,650 --> 01:54:02,460
Oh,
is it today?

2519
01:54:02,460 --> 01:54:04,320
I thought he had quit that years ago 
though.

2520
01:54:04,400 --> 01:54:05,460
This just got posted.
I think.

2521
01:54:05,640 --> 01:54:08,380
Think maybe Jamie,
I'm sending you an article to where he's

2522
01:54:08,381 --> 01:54:12,790
realizing how problematic it is to be 
connected with these people.

2523
01:54:13,090 --> 01:54:14,230
And you know,
look,

2524
01:54:14,470 --> 01:54:16,870
it's one of those fucking things.
You want to have a group,

2525
01:54:17,170 --> 01:54:18,003
you can't control everyone in the group.
So anybody in the group that does 

2526
01:54:20,591 --> 01:54:22,290
something horrible.
I just sent you something.

2527
01:54:22,900 --> 01:54:23,733
Pull this up.
This is Gavin's response to all this 

2528
01:54:24,761 --> 01:54:27,430
because so many people got mad at me 
that I had Gavin on the first place.

2529
01:54:27,760 --> 01:54:28,593
First of all I had Gavin on because used
to be one of the founders of vice also 

2530
01:54:31,691 --> 01:54:34,900
because I had Gavin on before that and 
he was fun to hang out with.

2531
01:54:34,930 --> 01:54:39,130
Then when I had them on,
I've had them on the last time.

2532
01:54:39,400 --> 01:54:42,190
One of the things that he was talking 
about was the proud boys.

2533
01:54:42,191 --> 01:54:43,660
I didn't even know what the fuck that 
was.

2534
01:54:43,720 --> 01:54:46,210
I think maybe I'd heard of it,
but I thought it was a joke.

2535
01:54:46,820 --> 01:54:47,653
Turned out he used to be a joke.
It started off as a joke on compound 

2536
01:54:50,771 --> 01:54:53,230
media and Anthony will get into a 
better.

2537
01:54:53,231 --> 01:54:54,064
He knows the history of it,
but they were making fun of something 

2538
01:54:56,200 --> 01:54:59,740
and they decided to make a fake mock 
group called the proud boys.

2539
01:54:59,860 --> 01:55:00,693
Now the problem with this is when you 
have a group that's supposed to be 

2540
01:55:03,281 --> 01:55:04,114
fighting and the va and I actually tried
to express this to him when he was on 

2541
01:55:06,491 --> 01:55:08,800
the show because he was talking about 
kicking people's ass.

2542
01:55:08,801 --> 01:55:09,634
We're going to punch him in the face.
I'm telling them to punch people in the 

2543
01:55:10,691 --> 01:55:11,141
face.
I'm like,

2544
01:55:11,141 --> 01:55:13,840
okay,
that's not how reality works.

2545
01:55:13,900 --> 01:55:15,100
Like,
I don't know if you've ever been punched

2546
01:55:15,101 --> 01:55:15,934
in the face or if you've been around 
people that like to punch people in the 

2547
01:55:17,981 --> 01:55:18,814
face,
but you don't just punch someone in the 

2548
01:55:19,481 --> 01:55:20,050
face.

2549
01:55:20,050 --> 01:55:21,970
What happens is you punched him in the 
face,

2550
01:55:21,971 --> 01:55:23,920
they come back with a bat,
somebody gets a knife,

2551
01:55:23,921 --> 01:55:26,110
people get guns.
It always escalates.

2552
01:55:26,200 --> 01:55:27,033
It's going to keep going.
You don't just get away with punching 

2553
01:55:28,481 --> 01:55:30,040
people in the face,
you know,

2554
01:55:30,041 --> 01:55:30,874
and yeah,
it's not good that these antifa people 

2555
01:55:32,261 --> 01:55:33,094
bring bike locks and smack people in the
heads with them and that's kind of the 

2556
01:55:34,931 --> 01:55:35,764
point in that in the first place.
Those people don't understand what 

2557
01:55:38,591 --> 01:55:41,500
happens when you start the chain of 
violence.

2558
01:55:41,710 --> 01:55:44,400
When you started that domino.
They don't understand what happens.

2559
01:55:44,430 --> 01:55:45,263
They think that they're living in some 
fucking book that they love about some 

2560
01:55:48,060 --> 01:55:48,893
revolutionary liberal character that 
reaches out and and smashes all these 

2561
01:55:54,271 --> 01:55:58,200
oppressors of social justice.
That's not reality and reality.

2562
01:55:58,201 --> 01:56:00,270
You just hit a guy with a lock,
was talking to you,

2563
01:56:00,390 --> 01:56:01,223
you assaulted him with a deadly weapon,
and the next thing you know they're 

2564
01:56:02,761 --> 01:56:04,300
going to kill you or they're going to 
beat you.

2565
01:56:04,310 --> 01:56:05,143
They're going to punch you.
So when a guy like Gavin says something 

2566
01:56:07,531 --> 01:56:09,600
like,
you should punch them in the face.

2567
01:56:09,990 --> 01:56:14,490
I understand why he said that because 
they were inciting violence.

2568
01:56:14,491 --> 01:56:15,324
These,
these antifa people would hit people 

2569
01:56:16,471 --> 01:56:18,300
with things that were in masks.
They,

2570
01:56:18,301 --> 01:56:21,090
some of them,
some of them were doing it nonviolently.

2571
01:56:21,091 --> 01:56:24,810
Some of them just wanted what they 
thought was the right things to happen.

2572
01:56:24,840 --> 01:56:27,750
But like all groups,
you get a fucking big group.

2573
01:56:27,751 --> 01:56:29,340
You can't control everybody in the 
group.

2574
01:56:29,510 --> 01:56:30,990
And that happened with the proud boys 
too,

2575
01:56:30,991 --> 01:56:31,824
I think.
I think he decided to have this thing 

2576
01:56:33,751 --> 01:56:34,890
that was going to,
you know,

2577
01:56:34,920 --> 01:56:35,753
mockingly oppose Antifa.
Then it became real and then it became 

2578
01:56:40,141 --> 01:56:41,740
violence.
And just this is.

2579
01:56:41,800 --> 01:56:45,990
This is just one of the problems that 
people have when there's a fucking group

2580
01:56:45,991 --> 01:56:49,920
of people have post to another group of 
people and you know,

2581
01:56:49,980 --> 01:56:52,380
him quitting the proud boys is 
definitely smart.

2582
01:56:52,530 --> 01:56:53,363
But I don't think it's going to help 
because now people are saying he's a 

2583
01:56:55,681 --> 01:56:56,514
white supremacist and what the 
perception that people have of you is 

2584
01:56:59,671 --> 01:57:03,030
almost important,
almost as important as what you actually

2585
01:57:03,031 --> 01:57:06,150
do.
It's probably even more important almost

2586
01:57:06,450 --> 01:57:07,283
because not for you and not for me,
not for people that are gonna actually 

2587
01:57:09,421 --> 01:57:11,940
read into it,
but for people in the outside,

2588
01:57:12,240 --> 01:57:16,440
the perception of who you are,
is it just too many things to learn?

2589
01:57:16,600 --> 01:57:17,910
Okay,
he's a racist.

2590
01:57:17,940 --> 01:57:20,040
Oh fuck that racist.
That's all people here.

2591
01:57:20,130 --> 01:57:22,050
That's all they say.
And then they keep moving.

2592
01:57:22,260 --> 01:57:24,210
Meanwhile you've got a guy who's Gavin 
who,

2593
01:57:24,660 --> 01:57:25,980
first of all,
he's not even American.

2594
01:57:26,010 --> 01:57:27,120
He's Canadian.
Second of all,

2595
01:57:27,121 --> 01:57:30,180
he's married to a native American woman.
He is not a racist.

2596
01:57:30,270 --> 01:57:32,700
He said he's a provocateur.
One hundred percent.

2597
01:57:32,701 --> 01:57:33,534
Unquestionably.
He says ridiculous shit because he 

2598
01:57:34,891 --> 01:57:38,020
thinks it's funny,
but he's a very bad situation.

2599
01:57:38,020 --> 01:57:42,010
Is almost a troll or like.
I didn't even think like I've,

2600
01:57:42,110 --> 01:57:44,190
I know him,
like we're not good,

2601
01:57:44,191 --> 01:57:45,024
good friends.
But I,

2602
01:57:45,080 --> 01:57:45,913
I,
I liked them a lot and I'm pretty sure 

2603
01:57:47,851 --> 01:57:50,580
he's not even right wing.
I think he's just fucking,

2604
01:57:50,800 --> 01:57:54,960
he's definitely fucking with people and 
he definitely has some right wing ideas,

2605
01:57:54,961 --> 01:57:55,794
but more than that,
he doesn't like some of the ridiculous 

2606
01:57:58,951 --> 01:58:01,400
aspects of the left,
so it's more in.

2607
01:58:01,510 --> 01:58:02,343
It's again,
like he's a more opposed some of the 

2608
01:58:04,861 --> 01:58:07,800
more preposterous notions of relapsed 
and he is really right.

2609
01:58:07,840 --> 01:58:09,900
Yeah,
but he's right on some things to a right

2610
01:58:09,901 --> 01:58:10,734
wing on some things,
but he came onto the show dressed like 

2611
01:58:14,101 --> 01:58:17,760
fucking Michael Douglas from falling 
down as a goof.

2612
01:58:17,761 --> 01:58:22,230
He brought a freezer case and everything
or a tie and a white short sleeve button

2613
01:58:22,231 --> 01:58:24,060
up shirt.
He did it as a goof.

2614
01:58:24,061 --> 01:58:25,050
Like that's him.
He's a.

2615
01:58:25,470 --> 01:58:27,210
he's a weird guy.
Is Funny.

2616
01:58:27,540 --> 01:58:28,800
He says funny shit,
but he.

2617
01:58:29,220 --> 01:58:31,080
But in this,
when you.

2618
01:58:32,350 --> 01:58:34,380
There's two different ways you can go 
through life,

2619
01:58:34,381 --> 01:58:36,060
right?
He could pretend,

2620
01:58:36,330 --> 01:58:37,163
put on an act or you can be yourself.
What he's chosen to do is a little bit 

2621
01:58:40,591 --> 01:58:42,070
of both.
He's chosen

2622
01:58:42,070 --> 01:58:44,770
to pretend a little bit but also be 
himself,

2623
01:58:45,100 --> 01:58:47,770
so it's hard for people to know where 
the line is.

2624
01:58:48,520 --> 01:58:50,080
That's fun.
That's fun.

2625
01:58:50,081 --> 01:58:50,914
If you're getting away with it.
It's not fun when it turns on you and 

2626
01:58:54,281 --> 01:58:54,760
then you go,
no,

2627
01:58:54,760 --> 01:58:55,593
that part I was joking around about 
people like says who like who's who's 

2628
01:58:59,591 --> 01:59:01,990
right and who's wrong.
Like it gets.

2629
01:59:02,020 --> 01:59:05,260
It gets real slippery when people don't 
actually know who you are,

2630
01:59:05,261 --> 01:59:07,510
where you stand.
And I think he was,

2631
01:59:07,750 --> 01:59:08,583
he thought it was fun to fuck with 
people a little bit on with certain 

2632
01:59:10,811 --> 01:59:15,250
things and in this climate man that can 
be fucking dangerous.

2633
01:59:15,490 --> 01:59:16,231
Yeah,
definitely.

2634
01:59:16,231 --> 01:59:19,240
And Kaufman of 2018.
No he's not.

2635
01:59:19,300 --> 01:59:20,260
He's a different thing.
He's,

2636
01:59:20,280 --> 01:59:21,730
he's Gavin McInnes,
you know,

2637
01:59:21,731 --> 01:59:24,220
and I really,
I'm sad that all this shit is going down

2638
01:59:24,520 --> 01:59:28,210
and I hope it passes over and,
and people get to understand me.

2639
01:59:28,210 --> 01:59:30,430
It's not a perfect person,
but no one is.

2640
01:59:30,700 --> 01:59:33,000
But what he has is an interesting guy.
He was weird.

2641
01:59:33,250 --> 01:59:34,083
Says Funny Shit.
Did he take a shit on the air once on a 

2642
01:59:36,581 --> 01:59:37,414
show?
He stuck his finger up his ass and shit 

2643
01:59:38,600 --> 01:59:40,660
up.
He's not a bad guy.

2644
01:59:40,840 --> 01:59:42,310
He's a maniac.
Yeah.

2645
01:59:42,850 --> 01:59:45,430
If there's something we're right now 
going on,

2646
01:59:45,431 --> 01:59:50,431
like in 2018 that the left hates or 
right the right hates the left and we're

2647
01:59:51,371 --> 01:59:53,830
all exactly the same.
Or you know,

2648
01:59:54,010 --> 01:59:57,810
a difference between what you said.
Yes.

2649
01:59:57,860 --> 02:00:00,130
The stupidity in the group.
Just the whole group.

2650
02:00:00,131 --> 02:00:00,964
I'm going to hate.
Exactly like the worst common 

2651
02:00:02,321 --> 02:00:04,320
denominator.
The worst common denominator.

2652
02:00:04,340 --> 02:00:07,090
The worst actors in any group define 
that group.

2653
02:00:07,630 --> 02:00:09,310
So whether it's,
you know,

2654
02:00:09,640 --> 02:00:10,840
people that are on the right.
Look,

2655
02:00:10,841 --> 02:00:12,310
there's a lot of people who are on the 
right whore,

2656
02:00:12,311 --> 02:00:16,090
fiscally conservative but socially 
liberal and they just,

2657
02:00:16,390 --> 02:00:17,223
they just don't think that you should 
spend money like crazy and they believe 

2658
02:00:19,391 --> 02:00:21,760
in discipline and they believe and you 
know,

2659
02:00:21,820 --> 02:00:25,030
having an intelligent financial 
planning,

2660
02:00:25,090 --> 02:00:26,020
you know,
and there's,

2661
02:00:26,050 --> 02:00:31,050
there's that as well as people who are 
socially democratic socialist.

2662
02:00:32,310 --> 02:00:33,143
I think you could spend all the rich 
people's money on all these other 

2663
02:00:34,871 --> 02:00:35,704
things.
There's just as many people because 

2664
02:00:36,761 --> 02:00:38,470
they're like,
there's a way broader spectrum,

2665
02:00:38,590 --> 02:00:39,423
but you have to pick a side.
I think most of us are like 90 percent 

2666
02:00:42,251 --> 02:00:46,870
in the metal and then there's the five 
five on each side that like,

2667
02:00:47,230 --> 02:00:47,951
you're like,
no,

2668
02:00:47,951 --> 02:00:51,370
I'm more left leaning and then you see 
like extreme left and you're like,

2669
02:00:51,371 --> 02:00:52,750
what the fuck is wrong with these 
people?

2670
02:00:52,751 --> 02:00:53,561
Okay,
I'm more right.

2671
02:00:53,561 --> 02:00:55,420
And then you see the fucking Weirdos on 
the right.

2672
02:00:55,630 --> 02:00:56,830
You're like,
what the fuck?

2673
02:00:57,220 --> 02:01:00,640
Like there's something very scary on 
both sides.

2674
02:01:00,820 --> 02:01:02,890
Yeah.
And when you see that scary thing,

2675
02:01:02,891 --> 02:01:04,680
you want to pose that thing.
So you become what?

2676
02:01:04,690 --> 02:01:05,530
It's the op,
you know,

2677
02:01:05,531 --> 02:01:07,780
you become a left wing person,
you decided,

2678
02:01:07,781 --> 02:01:09,340
well we've got to stop trump no matter 
what.

2679
02:01:09,610 --> 02:01:12,790
Whatever is never trump.
I mean there was a lot of that going on.

2680
02:01:13,330 --> 02:01:17,920
I think the only reason why I went more 
to the right side is because of the free

2681
02:01:17,921 --> 02:01:20,560
speech thing,
because I think pretty much everything.

2682
02:01:20,561 --> 02:01:21,394
I'm more left leaning except the free 
speech thing that I'm more right 

2683
02:01:24,401 --> 02:01:25,540
leaning.
It's insane.

2684
02:01:25,620 --> 02:01:28,090
It shouldn't be a writer left thing.
Well,

2685
02:01:28,091 --> 02:01:28,924
it's insane.
To me that's the left that's having a 

2686
02:01:31,001 --> 02:01:31,834
problem with free speech.
That's what's insane to me because I 

2687
02:01:33,941 --> 02:01:34,774
always thought the left was all about 
free expression and intelligence and 

2688
02:01:36,881 --> 02:01:40,070
education and it used to be,
it also used

2689
02:01:40,070 --> 02:01:45,070
to be more about peaceful behavior,
like the hippies in the,

2690
02:01:45,560 --> 02:01:46,393
you know,
the seventies where everything really 

2691
02:01:47,360 --> 02:01:50,450
changed in the sixties,
which really did launch a revolution and

2692
02:01:50,451 --> 02:01:52,940
changed a lot of America during the 
sixties,

2693
02:01:52,941 --> 02:01:53,774
in the seventies.
And a lot of it is inspired by 

2694
02:01:54,591 --> 02:01:55,760
psychedelic drugs.
Right?

2695
02:01:56,720 --> 02:01:57,830
All those people,
man,

2696
02:01:57,831 --> 02:01:58,664
but nonviolent.
That was a big part of that whole 

2697
02:02:00,051 --> 02:02:01,730
movement was all love,
you know,

2698
02:02:02,060 --> 02:02:06,320
and the hippies movement of today is not
the same.

2699
02:02:06,350 --> 02:02:07,183
It's like a feeble,
small subset of the overall aggressive 

2700
02:02:12,471 --> 02:02:14,530
liberal group,
you know,

2701
02:02:14,720 --> 02:02:16,350
that thinks that,
you know,

2702
02:02:16,400 --> 02:02:17,233
they've got to stomp out sexism and 
racism and transphobia and all these 

2703
02:02:19,821 --> 02:02:23,360
things and like really aggressive front 
running,

2704
02:02:23,570 --> 02:02:24,403
you know,
the ones who want to change policy and 

2705
02:02:26,241 --> 02:02:27,074
change culture and change society.
So when you get and teeth involved and 

2706
02:02:31,041 --> 02:02:31,874
you get people screaming in people's 
faces and people going to lectures and 

2707
02:02:35,001 --> 02:02:38,510
blocking lectures and threatening 
violence and like,

2708
02:02:38,511 --> 02:02:41,660
wow,
this is a very different kind of vibe.

2709
02:02:42,110 --> 02:02:44,660
Then what changed the world in 67?

2710
02:02:45,100 --> 02:02:45,933
I used to have a bit about how the best 
way to deal with hate is with love and 

2711
02:02:50,020 --> 02:02:55,020
that I truly believed that if someone 
like w and I try to do that.

2712
02:02:56,081 --> 02:02:58,330
Like it was weird when I was going 
through my weird face,

2713
02:02:58,331 --> 02:03:02,140
but now whenever people say I fucking 
hate you because you did this,

2714
02:03:02,141 --> 02:03:02,974
you did this.
I tried to understand why they hate me 

2715
02:03:05,170 --> 02:03:06,003
to.
And I generally do understand like I'm 

2716
02:03:07,931 --> 02:03:09,550
not a fucking idiot.
So I know,

2717
02:03:09,700 --> 02:03:10,361
okay.
Yeah,

2718
02:03:10,361 --> 02:03:10,831
I,
I'm,

2719
02:03:10,831 --> 02:03:12,940
I'm a guy that made fun of a disabled 
boy.

2720
02:03:12,941 --> 02:03:14,620
I get,
I get how you can hate that.

2721
02:03:14,920 --> 02:03:17,620
But then I try,
I try to,

2722
02:03:18,100 --> 02:03:19,330
you know,
instead of going,

2723
02:03:19,331 --> 02:03:20,830
fuck you,
I'm allowed doing this.

2724
02:03:20,831 --> 02:03:22,600
I show them respect.
I show them love.

2725
02:03:22,601 --> 02:03:25,000
And then after like three minutes,
they're always like,

2726
02:03:25,360 --> 02:03:26,170
oh no.
Yeah,

2727
02:03:26,170 --> 02:03:28,360
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry if I told you you shouldn't do

2728
02:03:28,361 --> 02:03:28,570
that.

2729
02:03:28,570 --> 02:03:29,403
No,
you shouldn't.

2730
02:03:29,530 --> 02:03:30,363
I,
it's so easy to change people's minds 

2731
02:03:32,591 --> 02:03:34,720
just by listening to people.
Some.

2732
02:03:35,270 --> 02:03:36,140
No,
it's,

2733
02:03:36,160 --> 02:03:39,280
it's also probably as like,
these people don't know you.

2734
02:03:39,370 --> 02:03:42,190
They're just engaging with you to get a 
reaction out of people.

2735
02:03:42,191 --> 02:03:43,024
One,
it's not just some people are what is 

2736
02:03:44,770 --> 02:03:46,270
some people,
but most people,

2737
02:03:46,271 --> 02:03:50,110
if you're one on one in real life on,
on the Internet,

2738
02:03:50,111 --> 02:03:51,400
on facebook,
on twitter,

2739
02:03:51,430 --> 02:03:54,040
it's really hard to change how people 
think.

2740
02:03:54,220 --> 02:03:56,680
But if you've talked to people and you 
realize,

2741
02:03:56,681 --> 02:03:57,514
okay,
this guy's not a month and this guy is 

2742
02:03:58,991 --> 02:04:02,120
not an asshole.
Because whenever people want to like,

2743
02:04:02,230 --> 02:04:03,030
like if,
if,

2744
02:04:03,030 --> 02:04:03,863
if you,
some guy that doesn't like you on the 

2745
02:04:05,201 --> 02:04:06,580
Internet that goes,
uh,

2746
02:04:06,610 --> 02:04:08,860
Joe Rogan's a fucking asshole.
If,

2747
02:04:09,030 --> 02:04:11,770
if you met him,
he wouldn't say that.

2748
02:04:11,950 --> 02:04:13,990
And,
and if he did think you were an asshole,

2749
02:04:13,991 --> 02:04:17,500
he'd explained this is what I think.
And then you'd talked to him and he'd be

2750
02:04:17,501 --> 02:04:18,190
like,
oh no,

2751
02:04:18,190 --> 02:04:19,270
Joe Rogan's a good guy.

2752
02:04:19,480 --> 02:04:20,060
Listen,
there's,

2753
02:04:20,060 --> 02:04:20,893
there's definitely a limited amount that
you could get through when you're 

2754
02:04:24,280 --> 02:04:25,113
expressing yourself on twitter,
on instagram or something like that and 

2755
02:04:27,610 --> 02:04:28,443
people like to get reactions out of 
people so they want to get Mike Ward's 

2756
02:04:30,551 --> 02:04:31,384
goat,
they're going to fuck with you and say 

2757
02:04:32,471 --> 02:04:33,304
mean shit to you,
and they're doing it because they want 

2758
02:04:34,511 --> 02:04:38,070
to get a reaction and some of them don't
even think of you as a and they also

2759
02:04:38,070 --> 02:04:38,903
think of you as an easy target because 
you did something mean and because 

2760
02:04:42,271 --> 02:04:45,240
you're a guy in the public eye and 
you're a professional comedian and maybe

2761
02:04:45,241 --> 02:04:47,420
they hate their job and like,
fuck this guy.

2762
02:04:47,730 --> 02:04:51,510
Is he living his dream when I have to do
the Shitty job?

2763
02:04:51,690 --> 02:04:52,560
Yeah,
yeah,

2764
02:04:52,830 --> 02:04:53,760
yeah.
That's a lot of it.

2765
02:04:53,761 --> 02:04:56,160
So it's a Shitty,
it's a Shitty,

2766
02:04:56,161 --> 02:04:58,920
but b,
you don't really know because the whole,

2767
02:04:59,760 --> 02:05:03,270
the whole interaction sucks.
Like he's wrong,

2768
02:05:03,271 --> 02:05:04,500
you're wrong.
Everybody's wrong.

2769
02:05:04,590 --> 02:05:05,423
Though.
The whole thing is stupid and 

2770
02:05:07,591 --> 02:05:10,200
interacting with people like that and 
going back and forth with them.

2771
02:05:10,350 --> 02:05:12,150
I've done it before.
It's stupid to do,

2772
02:05:12,540 --> 02:05:15,030
but it's just a complete waste of 
energy.

2773
02:05:15,420 --> 02:05:17,550
Did you get along shit,
your last special?

2774
02:05:17,810 --> 02:05:19,440
No,
no shit,

2775
02:05:19,500 --> 02:05:20,333
no fucking article from vegans,
but then ms dot quoted because they 

2776
02:05:26,580 --> 02:05:31,580
totally took me out of context because 
they said he calls vegans dip shits.

2777
02:05:32,280 --> 02:05:33,113
That's not what I said.
What I said was that the majority of 

2778
02:05:35,371 --> 02:05:36,204
Vegans I think are good people who are 
just trying to live their lives without 

2779
02:05:41,050 --> 02:05:41,883
something dying.
They just made this moral choice and 

2780
02:05:44,431 --> 02:05:45,264
then I say,
and those people pay for it with their 

2781
02:05:46,861 --> 02:05:48,290
health.
They're always sick.

2782
02:05:48,340 --> 02:05:53,310
Fuck up.
He looked like what the other job,

2783
02:05:53,700 --> 02:05:54,533
the other part of the job.
The other part of the joke was he used 

2784
02:05:58,171 --> 02:05:59,004
to like the other part of the joke was 
I'm in the rest of the people that are 

2785
02:06:03,301 --> 02:06:06,180
Vegan there really only vegan because 
scientology didn't find them first.

2786
02:06:06,390 --> 02:06:07,970
I go there,
fucking dip shits.

2787
02:06:08,490 --> 02:06:11,460
They coulda woulda joined the Taliban if
they took the wrong exit.

2788
02:06:11,630 --> 02:06:15,080
It's just so the took out.
He calls vegans dip shits.

2789
02:06:15,340 --> 02:06:16,173
No,
no,

2790
02:06:16,790 --> 02:06:21,120
that's not what I said,
but that's the title of the article.

2791
02:06:21,210 --> 02:06:23,190
That's the only thing that I feel like 
you're special.

2792
02:06:23,220 --> 02:06:26,070
I'm sure there's other things to thing 
about vegans.

2793
02:06:26,370 --> 02:06:27,203
I spent like four hours looking at 
pictures of people that have vacant 

2794
02:06:30,460 --> 02:06:34,590
cats.
That was like when when like I don't eat

2795
02:06:34,591 --> 02:06:37,400
meat or I don't eat meat product,
but my dogs I'm like,

2796
02:06:37,401 --> 02:06:40,230
cats do because like why am I going to 
decide?

2797
02:06:40,380 --> 02:06:45,380
Like I feel guilty if I eat steak,
but my fucking dog doesn't care my dog.

2798
02:06:45,811 --> 02:06:48,570
If I left my dog out of the house 
without me,

2799
02:06:48,660 --> 02:06:51,840
he'd fucking kill everything,
so why am I going to be like,

2800
02:06:51,841 --> 02:06:53,040
no,
no young man.

2801
02:06:53,041 --> 02:06:53,874
You're going to eat carrots.
I know dogs can be vegan without 

2802
02:06:56,761 --> 02:07:01,761
swallowing hina,
but cats can't die like in a month and a

2803
02:07:02,220 --> 02:07:02,551
half.
Yeah.

2804
02:07:02,551 --> 02:07:03,384
That's why I wrote that,
but I didn't even know that people were 

2805
02:07:06,760 --> 02:07:07,890
that stupid,
that they.

2806
02:07:08,060 --> 02:07:11,400
They made their cats Vegan and then just
looking at the pictures,

2807
02:07:12,210 --> 02:07:15,720
there's something weird that like,
I think all vegetarian and Vegans,

2808
02:07:15,721 --> 02:07:18,450
if you look at animal cruelty,
you're always sad.

2809
02:07:18,690 --> 02:07:21,870
But when I was looking at Vegan cats,
it made me laugh.

2810
02:07:22,100 --> 02:07:23,250
I was like,
what the fuck?

2811
02:07:23,251 --> 02:07:24,084
It's so ridiculous,
so stupid because it's such a fucking 

2812
02:07:27,480 --> 02:07:28,313
glaringly ridiculous proposition.
Decide that a cat is no longer a 

2813
02:07:33,301 --> 02:07:36,460
carnivore.
They all looked freddy mercury

2814
02:07:36,700 --> 02:07:37,533
the last month of his life.
I don't know if Freddy Mercury was the 

2815
02:07:39,760 --> 02:07:42,660
last one.
Is Google a Vegan.

2816
02:07:42,790 --> 02:07:44,790
Cats need to see that

2817
02:07:44,960 --> 02:07:47,030
on his deathbed.
I don't need to see it.

2818
02:07:47,090 --> 02:07:48,020
I get it.
Yeah.

2819
02:07:48,350 --> 02:07:52,250
God Damn you made me feel like shit.
That was a good joke.

2820
02:07:52,251 --> 02:07:53,270
And I was like,
Oh,

2821
02:07:53,390 --> 02:07:54,223
I'm a bad person.
I thought maybe there was a real photo 

2822
02:07:55,941 --> 02:07:56,774
going around.

2823
02:07:57,020 --> 02:07:57,853
Oh,
the probably is that I've been through 

2824
02:07:59,010 --> 02:08:00,740
is.
Yeah,

2825
02:08:00,770 --> 02:08:02,060
it's um.
I don't know,

2826
02:08:02,061 --> 02:08:04,040
man.
If you,

2827
02:08:04,550 --> 02:08:08,000
if you can explain your comedy well 
today,

2828
02:08:08,001 --> 02:08:10,970
you can still get away with a lot,
but you just have to,

2829
02:08:11,140 --> 02:08:15,530
you have to take a lot of time to craft 
your bits and you gotta think about what

2830
02:08:15,531 --> 02:08:19,490
you're saying and how other people,
not just whether or not it works because

2831
02:08:19,491 --> 02:08:21,950
sometimes things work,
but you're saying things like,

2832
02:08:21,980 --> 02:08:22,813
oh,
I could have got away with the same 

2833
02:08:23,901 --> 02:08:28,550
exact thought and I would've been.
I would've been in more people's brains.

2834
02:08:28,551 --> 02:08:29,540
It would have gotten in smoother.

2835
02:08:29,970 --> 02:08:30,680
I did,
uh,

2836
02:08:30,680 --> 02:08:31,950
the,
I heard a thing,

2837
02:08:32,010 --> 02:08:33,660
I love Norm Mcdonald.
Look,

2838
02:08:33,750 --> 02:08:36,000
Norm Macdonald's,
my favorite comic of all time.

2839
02:08:36,390 --> 02:08:39,120
And He,
when I was going through my thing,

2840
02:08:39,390 --> 02:08:43,560
I saw a thing about him that he said 
that when he was doing weekend update,

2841
02:08:43,620 --> 02:08:44,453
he'd done a joke about someone that had 
just died and then he got an email from 

2842
02:08:47,740 --> 02:08:48,310
the,
the,

2843
02:08:48,310 --> 02:08:51,710
the people's family about her.
It was before email.

2844
02:08:51,711 --> 02:08:55,700
So I guess he got a letter of facts or 
whatever about the,

2845
02:08:55,740 --> 02:08:57,870
how they felt about that joke.
And he was like,

2846
02:08:57,900 --> 02:08:59,580
that made me realize that,
oh shit,

2847
02:08:59,581 --> 02:09:00,414
when I make fun of someone,
there's an actual person behind that 

2848
02:09:03,661 --> 02:09:04,410
joke.
There's.

2849
02:09:04,410 --> 02:09:05,660
And that,
what it,

2850
02:09:05,730 --> 02:09:08,070
it's weird that my,
my whole court thing,

2851
02:09:08,450 --> 02:09:09,660
uh,
like,

2852
02:09:09,690 --> 02:09:12,780
like when I was,
this was before I went to court,

2853
02:09:12,810 --> 02:09:15,510
I read norms thing and I was like,
oh fuck,

2854
02:09:15,511 --> 02:09:18,650
I never got that because I was doing 
jokes about this.

2855
02:09:18,970 --> 02:09:19,803
This kid was famous.
So in my mind it was like making fun of 

2856
02:09:22,621 --> 02:09:25,170
Justin Bieber was like making fun of 
whoever,

2857
02:09:25,200 --> 02:09:28,200
whoever.
But then I realized,

2858
02:09:28,230 --> 02:09:29,063
Oh fuck,
there's,

2859
02:09:29,100 --> 02:09:30,710
there's someone behind,
you know,

2860
02:09:31,380 --> 02:09:32,460
someone that feels

2861
02:09:33,270 --> 02:09:34,103
what you're saying is exactly what 
people experience when they hate on you 

2862
02:09:37,051 --> 02:09:37,950
online.
Yeah.

2863
02:09:38,770 --> 02:09:40,920
Oh,
it's exactly the same thing.

2864
02:09:41,670 --> 02:09:43,590
They don't think of you as being a 
person just the same way.

2865
02:09:43,591 --> 02:09:45,330
You don't think of Justin Bieber as 
being a person.

2866
02:09:45,480 --> 02:09:46,590
Exactly.
It's the same thing.

2867
02:09:46,650 --> 02:09:47,700
Exactly.
Yeah.

2868
02:09:47,701 --> 02:09:49,350
We're all guilty of it.
I think.

2869
02:09:50,250 --> 02:09:51,083
I mean,
I hope ultimately we were going to get 

2870
02:09:53,071 --> 02:09:53,904
past this.
I think a lot of what's happening with 

2871
02:09:55,591 --> 02:10:00,591
this is that this has only been around 
for like 20 years,

2872
02:10:01,530 --> 02:10:05,040
this internet way of communicating with,
with each other and only been around the

2873
02:10:05,041 --> 02:10:08,040
way it is really the way it is now for 
like less than 10.

2874
02:10:08,070 --> 02:10:09,120
Yeah.
You know,

2875
02:10:09,420 --> 02:10:12,300
and I think that we don't know what 
we're doing with it yet.

2876
02:10:12,330 --> 02:10:14,550
We don't know how to do it yet and we 
fuck it up.

2877
02:10:15,160 --> 02:10:15,993
And I think too,
like for comedy for a while when I was 

2878
02:10:17,921 --> 02:10:20,520
going through my thing,
everyone is telling me they're like,

2879
02:10:20,530 --> 02:10:23,350
do you think this is the death of like 
dark humor?

2880
02:10:23,351 --> 02:10:24,790
And,
and I don't think it is,

2881
02:10:24,791 --> 02:10:27,090
but I think we're gonna just be smarter 
about,

2882
02:10:27,110 --> 02:10:28,660
no,
you gotta get the fuck out of Canada.

2883
02:10:30,470 --> 02:10:33,080
But also,
I mean this is what everybody always.

2884
02:10:33,410 --> 02:10:34,130
This is the end.

2885
02:10:34,130 --> 02:10:36,330
This is the end of this.
I mean that was one of the things that I

2886
02:10:36,331 --> 02:10:38,990
read about the Nanette special.
This is the end of comedy.

2887
02:10:39,300 --> 02:10:40,133
Like she was gonna kill comment.
Like you never going to be at the end 

2888
02:10:41,901 --> 02:10:42,830
there,
but it's so silly.

2889
02:10:42,831 --> 02:10:45,290
Like why would someone not want to 
laugh?

2890
02:10:45,320 --> 02:10:47,630
It doesn't mean that it's not a good 
piece of art,

2891
02:10:47,850 --> 02:10:48,683
but why would someone not want to laugh?
I then there was another weird thing 

2892
02:10:51,411 --> 02:10:52,244
that she got interviewed and she said 
that she was going to retire unless 

2893
02:10:54,980 --> 02:10:58,460
Louis ck comes back and he does.
He comes back,

2894
02:10:58,461 --> 02:11:00,230
he comes back,
she realized,

2895
02:11:00,500 --> 02:11:03,600
she said work is not done yet.
Oh God.

2896
02:11:05,490 --> 02:11:09,960
I don't know if that's a real quote 
that.

2897
02:11:11,340 --> 02:11:14,450
But she might've been tongue and cheek.
But here's the thing,

2898
02:11:14,510 --> 02:11:15,321
right?
Like you,

2899
02:11:15,321 --> 02:11:16,730
you,
you say things to.

2900
02:11:16,780 --> 02:11:19,860
And I do.
She might've very well just kidding.

2901
02:11:21,080 --> 02:11:23,240
She might've been joking around like 
they might've been laughing,

2902
02:11:23,241 --> 02:11:24,950
she might've been done.
I guess my work is not done,

2903
02:11:24,980 --> 02:11:25,813
you know,
but then you see it flash in two 

2904
02:11:27,141 --> 02:11:27,974
dimensions and who knows?
I think I was angry at her because she 

2905
02:11:31,911 --> 02:11:32,744
didn't.
She said she didn't know who norm 

2906
02:11:33,900 --> 02:11:36,730
Mcdonald was like,
fuck you.

2907
02:11:37,130 --> 02:11:39,680
You know who norm Macdonald.
Maybe she doesn't.

2908
02:11:39,681 --> 02:11:42,380
Maybe she really isn't in the comedy.
I mean she's not from around here.

2909
02:11:42,700 --> 02:11:43,533
Even those,
those people in that country that left 

2910
02:11:45,741 --> 02:11:49,760
Africa,
they know who norm McDonald's.

2911
02:11:50,500 --> 02:11:54,530
Mcdonald's is a fucking genius.
Was on that boat growing coconuts.

2912
02:11:56,570 --> 02:11:58,420
I don't know man.
Don't norms.

2913
02:11:58,430 --> 02:11:59,930
Definitely a genius.
I missed the.

2914
02:12:00,650 --> 02:12:01,480
I can't get a human.

2915
02:12:01,480 --> 02:12:02,313
Must be on the podcast and someone could
put the Kibosh on him talking to people 

2916
02:12:05,751 --> 02:12:06,584
anymore.
She mentioned Louis C k again and 

2917
02:12:08,031 --> 02:12:10,850
possibly that he might mount a comeback.
I don't want to stop him.

2918
02:12:10,851 --> 02:12:15,390
She said it's worth just to see if he 
does have an audience.

2919
02:12:15,391 --> 02:12:17,600
Of course you will.
There was 18 seconds left.

2920
02:12:17,601 --> 02:12:19,850
The interview tape.
It didn't expect to take a turn.

2921
02:12:19,851 --> 02:12:23,450
Ms Dot Gatsby of course had other ideas.
If he does have an audience,

2922
02:12:23,690 --> 02:12:26,390
then I won't be quoting standup.
Ms Dot Gatsby said,

2923
02:12:26,630 --> 02:12:29,510
quote me on that.
If Louis ck finds his audience,

2924
02:12:29,511 --> 02:12:33,830
I will definitely not quit standup 
because my work here is not done.

2925
02:12:34,250 --> 02:12:35,083
Okay.
But then also,

2926
02:12:35,090 --> 02:12:38,810
could you say,
say I said that with a cheeky smile.

2927
02:12:38,811 --> 02:12:39,770
She added and left them.

2928
02:12:40,410 --> 02:12:41,243
Oh,
so she was.

2929
02:12:41,530 --> 02:12:42,363
She was fucking around.
Why does the New York Times still use 

2930
02:12:44,860 --> 02:12:46,770
tape to record?
I don't know,

2931
02:12:46,780 --> 02:12:49,750
but I liked that she said that.
Say that I said it with a cheeky smile.

2932
02:12:49,751 --> 02:12:50,584
So good.
Like a little joke as we suspected she 

2933
02:12:53,261 --> 02:12:56,380
was tongue in cheek,
like literally she sang cheeky smile.

2934
02:12:56,530 --> 02:12:58,270
So that's exactly what tongue and cheek 
means.

2935
02:12:58,271 --> 02:12:59,530
The same thing.
Yeah.

2936
02:12:59,650 --> 02:13:00,730
So good for her.
Yeah,

2937
02:13:01,270 --> 02:13:03,820
man.
The shade do anything wrong.

2938
02:13:03,821 --> 02:13:05,140
It's not stealing.
Who Cares?

2939
02:13:05,350 --> 02:13:08,320
Anything transcribed can look fucked up.
Her Act,

2940
02:13:08,321 --> 02:13:10,300
all of it.
Like the animosity,

2941
02:13:10,301 --> 02:13:13,750
the fucking tension.
Who cares so unnecessary.

2942
02:13:13,810 --> 02:13:15,400
I have a couple of friends because 
they're there.

2943
02:13:15,410 --> 02:13:18,460
A lot of Canadian comics by say by 
saying that,

2944
02:13:18,461 --> 02:13:20,290
I mean against her.
That's what I mean.

2945
02:13:20,291 --> 02:13:22,570
I don't mean like her animosity towards 
anybody else,

2946
02:13:22,750 --> 02:13:26,710
a Canadian comics generally they used to
come here to the states,

2947
02:13:26,950 --> 02:13:31,060
but like 10 years ago they start going 
to England or Australia and I,

2948
02:13:31,260 --> 02:13:34,200
a lot of Canadian comics that knew her 
and they were like,

2949
02:13:34,350 --> 02:13:37,890
she used to be really funny and I think 
it was just this show.

2950
02:13:38,040 --> 02:13:38,873
There was like a more serious show.
So maybe in the interviews she just 

2951
02:13:41,761 --> 02:13:44,310
fucking around pretending like she 
doesn't know,

2952
02:13:44,311 --> 02:13:46,360
nor could be.
This is what she wants to do now to,

2953
02:13:46,361 --> 02:13:47,194
you know,
just because you're really funny for a 

2954
02:13:47,941 --> 02:13:48,810
long time.
I mean,

2955
02:13:49,620 --> 02:13:54,620
I think that is something that I'm the 
fuck is her name.

2956
02:13:55,350 --> 02:13:59,350
Someone is doing that now too.
She just did something where she,

2957
02:13:59,430 --> 02:14:00,360
she did an interview about it

2958
02:14:00,390 --> 02:14:03,020
that God dammit fuck is her name.

2959
02:14:06,490 --> 02:14:09,360
I got woken up real early this morning.
I'm super foggy.

2960
02:14:09,380 --> 02:14:11,460
My kid climbed into bed this morning at 
5:00

2961
02:14:11,460 --> 02:14:12,340
AM,
they're going to go back to sleep.

2962
02:14:12,880 --> 02:14:13,930
She was,
um,

2963
02:14:14,020 --> 02:14:14,853
she's a constant.
She's a regular on the Howard stern 

2964
02:14:16,151 --> 02:14:17,440
show.
She used to be really big.

2965
02:14:17,441 --> 02:14:19,300
She lost a lot of weight.
Got Her stomach stapled.

2966
02:14:19,630 --> 02:14:20,463
Very funny.

2967
02:14:22,550 --> 02:14:25,590
So is she called the scholarship?
The Queen of mean uh,

2968
02:14:25,620 --> 02:14:26,450
um,
the,

2969
02:14:26,450 --> 02:14:27,283
she used to do the and Lisa.
So Lisa Lampanelli is not doing standup 

2970
02:14:32,150 --> 02:14:32,983
anymore because she's tired of hurting 
people's feelings and she's going to 

2971
02:14:36,291 --> 02:14:38,320
tell stories now.
Yeah,

2972
02:14:38,510 --> 02:14:40,460
she loves him.
Kind of shared or talk about it.

2973
02:14:40,461 --> 02:14:41,480
She loves.
So she,

2974
02:14:41,510 --> 02:14:43,730
she,
she changed what she does,

2975
02:14:43,910 --> 02:14:44,743
which is fine.
Like you should be allowed to change 

2976
02:14:45,771 --> 02:14:50,540
what you do is it always made me feel 
bad about my reaction,

2977
02:14:51,020 --> 02:14:53,090
my reaction to that with like,
fuck.

2978
02:14:53,270 --> 02:14:55,480
And then what you said.
So right.

2979
02:14:55,490 --> 02:14:56,630
That was like,
fuck.

2980
02:14:56,910 --> 02:14:59,390
All my reactions are always.
Well,

2981
02:14:59,391 --> 02:15:01,800
here's the thing,
he thinks about it.

2982
02:15:02,260 --> 02:15:05,930
You got and you have a brain.
You gotta know who the real enemies are.

2983
02:15:05,931 --> 02:15:08,510
Otherwise you'll waste all your venom on
the fake ones.

2984
02:15:08,780 --> 02:15:11,280
You don't want to want to save your 
venom for the real,

2985
02:15:11,480 --> 02:15:15,060
real entities so that everybody else you
could make the like this.

2986
02:15:15,080 --> 02:15:17,270
You could make peace with it.
You don't need this.

2987
02:15:17,330 --> 02:15:18,440
There she is.
Bam.

2988
02:15:18,530 --> 02:15:20,570
Storyteller.
So she called her.

2989
02:15:20,630 --> 02:15:22,400
What does it say?
Shrink that shit down.

2990
02:15:22,401 --> 02:15:26,600
So I can read her heading sugar down 
storyteller.

2991
02:15:27,170 --> 02:15:28,040
Yeah,
there it is.

2992
02:15:28,100 --> 02:15:31,340
Workshop leader inspiration to millions.
Well he got a little crazy there.

2993
02:15:32,460 --> 02:15:34,930
I think she's just gone crazy.
Yeah.

2994
02:15:35,060 --> 02:15:37,250
She might be gone.
He's lost her fucking mind.

2995
02:15:37,280 --> 02:15:39,710
Or She's enjoying herself.
Free expression.

2996
02:15:39,711 --> 02:15:43,850
She got a lot of fans and she's happy.
Anson just wearing a hoodie.

2997
02:15:44,510 --> 02:15:47,360
I don't want to hear that,
but she looks very different.

2998
02:15:47,361 --> 02:15:49,450
It's strange.
It's called Pilsen biomat.

2999
02:15:49,460 --> 02:15:53,060
The pharmaceutical.
Different book she's doing.

3000
02:15:53,280 --> 02:15:54,140
Yeah.
She's not been fun,

3001
02:15:54,141 --> 02:15:54,974
man.
Good for her.

3002
02:15:55,250 --> 02:15:59,030
Good start on her show and a storyteller
show.

3003
02:15:59,070 --> 02:15:59,903
It's hilarious.
I don't think it's going to be that 

3004
02:16:02,031 --> 02:16:05,110
different to what she used to do because
you know,

3005
02:16:05,150 --> 02:16:08,000
people evolve,
people change and that's normal.

3006
02:16:08,001 --> 02:16:08,834
Like there's nothing sadder than seeing 
a comic you saw 20 years ago and then 

3007
02:16:11,991 --> 02:16:15,290
you see them again this year and it's 
the same fucking shit.

3008
02:16:15,470 --> 02:16:18,770
So it's good that she have the same act.
Really Sad.

3009
02:16:18,920 --> 02:16:22,640
That's really sad.
Sealer guy from like the nineties.

3010
02:16:22,670 --> 02:16:25,550
It's still around and they haven't.
They literally have written a joke.

3011
02:16:26,030 --> 02:16:26,780
Yeah,
there's.

3012
02:16:26,780 --> 02:16:27,810
Those guys are real.
All right.

3013
02:16:27,820 --> 02:16:30,100
We see them guys are scary.
There was some

3014
02:16:30,120 --> 02:16:30,953
land over these last night,
the journal Roast battle before there 

3015
02:16:33,461 --> 02:16:38,461
was a Jeremiah Watkins did a thing about
ads comic that it was the best.

3016
02:16:39,070 --> 02:16:39,903
It was so funny.
It was his thing on the Internet that 

3017
02:16:42,401 --> 02:16:45,400
were were when you did a killed Tony 
that he comes out as.

3018
02:16:45,410 --> 02:16:49,000
You think he's a funny dude

3019
02:16:51,420 --> 02:16:52,890
tonight that stand up on the spot.
She.

3020
02:16:52,891 --> 02:16:53,724
Okay.
Oh,

3021
02:16:53,780 --> 02:16:55,800
it's him.
It's his show.

3022
02:16:55,880 --> 02:16:56,713
Yeah.
He used to call it thunderpussy for a 

3023
02:16:57,661 --> 02:16:58,800
little while.
I don't know why.

3024
02:16:59,490 --> 02:17:00,323
I think that was Brian.
I think Brian decided to call it 

3025
02:17:01,440 --> 02:17:03,840
thunderpussy.
Voted on name.

3026
02:17:03,841 --> 02:17:08,310
I believe better name.
Democracy should stick with that name.

3027
02:17:08,360 --> 02:17:10,500
That's what thunderpussy is a way better
name.

3028
02:17:11,380 --> 02:17:13,700
Stand up on the spot.
You're so literal,

3029
02:17:14,860 --> 02:17:15,693
you know,
but the problem with Thunderpussy is 

3030
02:17:16,560 --> 02:17:18,600
people might not know what it is,
but if they should,

3031
02:17:18,601 --> 02:17:20,130
why don't they know.
I'll figure it out.

3032
02:17:20,190 --> 02:17:22,560
Two hundred plus posts is the way to do 
it.

3033
02:17:23,340 --> 02:17:25,920
Yeah.
Jeremiah listened to me during my vendor

3034
02:17:25,921 --> 02:17:26,880
pussy.
Yeah.

3035
02:17:26,881 --> 02:17:29,550
He should bring thunderpussy back.
Yeah.

3036
02:17:29,551 --> 02:17:32,840
What is this name?
Stand up on the spot branding side.

3037
02:17:33,090 --> 02:17:35,940
How about call it standup comedy right 
on the spot?

3038
02:17:36,090 --> 02:17:36,390
No,
no,

3039
02:17:36,390 --> 02:17:38,110
no.
Stand up on the spot stand.

3040
02:17:38,120 --> 02:17:40,020
Standup comedy right on the spot right 
now.

3041
02:17:40,200 --> 02:17:41,340
That's the name of the title.
No,

3042
02:17:41,400 --> 02:17:42,720
thunderpussy.
Bam.

3043
02:17:43,260 --> 02:17:45,060
We're done here.
Right.

3044
02:17:45,760 --> 02:17:46,593
But he did do a good impression.
We know guys like that who are these 

3045
02:17:49,151 --> 02:17:50,440
comics,
didn't even,

3046
02:17:50,441 --> 02:17:51,274
etc.
It's just,

3047
02:17:51,630 --> 02:17:52,463
I don't want to call them comics.
It's just been the same thing for 20 

3048
02:17:54,581 --> 02:17:55,414
years and they're open microbes for 20 
years almost right in the go around 

3049
02:17:58,211 --> 02:18:01,370
doing maybe an opening spot somewhere 
and it's the same act,

3050
02:18:01,371 --> 02:18:05,650
so they'll have references In there of 
stores that don't exist anymore and it's

3051
02:18:05,651 --> 02:18:07,870
so weird when you watched them do it,
you're like,

3052
02:18:07,871 --> 02:18:12,070
well what am I is this is a train wreck?
Is this sadness weekend for those in,

3053
02:18:12,670 --> 02:18:13,503
in smaller markets,
like montreal is a fairly small market 

3054
02:18:16,090 --> 02:18:16,923
on the english side because there's so 
many french people and even like the 

3055
02:18:20,351 --> 02:18:22,450
end,
there's no money to be made in Canada.

3056
02:18:22,630 --> 02:18:23,463
So there are a lot of [inaudible] hacks 
and comics and in montreal it's a 

3057
02:18:28,721 --> 02:18:29,020
comedy.

3058
02:18:29,020 --> 02:18:32,050
Works stIll around.
It burned down like a couple months ago.

3059
02:18:32,580 --> 02:18:35,470
An amazing club that was down.
Yeah,

3060
02:18:35,950 --> 02:18:38,920
that would have been.
It was suspicious apparently.

3061
02:18:38,980 --> 02:18:41,580
I don't know the details,
but from what I understand,

3062
02:18:41,581 --> 02:18:43,930
they're going to rebuild the building.
They're going to break its legs.

3063
02:18:44,020 --> 02:18:47,680
Hopefully they're jimbo fucking took 
off.

3064
02:18:47,681 --> 02:18:48,600
Jimbo.
Uh,

3065
02:18:48,660 --> 02:18:49,470
he,
he,

3066
02:18:49,470 --> 02:18:50,660
he,
he sold it.

3067
02:18:50,720 --> 02:18:54,670
His mom died and then he sold it or he 
just closed it down.

3068
02:18:54,790 --> 02:18:55,451
He,
he,

3069
02:18:55,451 --> 02:18:56,284
yeah,
he closed it down than someone reopened 

3070
02:18:57,451 --> 02:18:58,810
it a few months later under the same 
name.

3071
02:18:58,840 --> 02:18:59,673
A couple of people that bought it that 
love the club and they reopened it up 

3072
02:19:02,441 --> 02:19:05,460
until when it burned down.
And do you remember ian?

3073
02:19:05,740 --> 02:19:08,620
He was,
the bartender said ian got a partner.

3074
02:19:08,621 --> 02:19:10,470
He opened it up.
And jimbo.

3075
02:19:10,540 --> 02:19:13,090
Jimbo was such a good guy.
Fucking love jumbo,

3076
02:19:13,240 --> 02:19:16,870
but he closed that club like a fucking 
piece of garbage.

3077
02:19:16,960 --> 02:19:19,450
He didn't tell anyone.
He didn't tell his staff.

3078
02:19:19,670 --> 02:19:20,503
He just fucking.
They showed up one night and they were 

3079
02:19:23,261 --> 02:19:24,070
like,
okay.

3080
02:19:24,070 --> 02:19:25,180
Oh,
the club fucking,

3081
02:19:25,330 --> 02:19:27,800
everything's taken out of the club.
He just left.

3082
02:19:28,450 --> 02:19:30,350
Yeah,
it must have been drunk.

3083
02:19:30,410 --> 02:19:31,000
Yeah.
Because you,

3084
02:19:31,000 --> 02:19:31,833
you use the.
I remember the first time I saw you was 

3085
02:19:35,781 --> 02:19:36,511
there?
Yeah.

3086
02:19:36,511 --> 02:19:38,930
I used to do all the time.
And you were like,

3087
02:19:38,960 --> 02:19:43,280
and this wasn't like in fucking like 
1984 or whatever.

3088
02:19:43,610 --> 02:19:45,950
I'm started going back that late.
But uh,

3089
02:19:46,310 --> 02:19:47,150
you were,
you were,

3090
02:19:47,630 --> 02:19:49,070
you were doing like big,
big,

3091
02:19:49,071 --> 02:19:49,521
big,
big,

3092
02:19:49,521 --> 02:19:50,354
big fucking rooms,
but you were there just to do a show 

3093
02:19:52,851 --> 02:19:54,050
for,
you know,

3094
02:19:54,080 --> 02:19:56,090
for the clubs.
Work for jimbo forever.

3095
02:19:56,091 --> 02:19:57,880
So I'd come back and work for free.
Uh,

3096
02:19:57,910 --> 02:19:58,743
did,
did a weekend for him for free once I 

3097
02:20:00,831 --> 02:20:02,690
just said,
just pay for my hotel.

3098
02:20:02,990 --> 02:20:03,980
I go,
let's just have some fun.

3099
02:20:04,030 --> 02:20:06,470
I just,
I just always loved being.

3100
02:20:06,950 --> 02:20:08,660
He's just,
he was such a great guy.

3101
02:20:08,810 --> 02:20:09,643
I'm sure.
Sure he's alive if he hears this still 

3102
02:20:11,260 --> 02:20:12,093
us.
But he's a great guy and I just enjoyed 

3103
02:20:13,941 --> 02:20:16,020
being around him and I was a struggle.

3104
02:20:16,060 --> 02:20:16,893
There was a small room,
it didn't have that many seats and he 

3105
02:20:19,050 --> 02:20:21,920
had two floors in a nice little bar 
downstairs and a pool table.

3106
02:20:21,921 --> 02:20:25,130
Then upstairs real intimate room.
it was just a great place.

3107
02:20:25,131 --> 02:20:27,580
And to me it was um,
it,

3108
02:20:27,620 --> 02:20:30,440
that place helped me.
It was um,

3109
02:20:30,680 --> 02:20:31,513
in the time when I started doing it was 
right when my career went from being 

3110
02:20:34,791 --> 02:20:39,791
like a middle act who was kind of going 
on the road and doing these weird little

3111
02:20:39,981 --> 02:20:42,980
gigs to becoming a headlight or getting 
on television.

3112
02:20:43,400 --> 02:20:44,233
All that happened.
A lot of it happened while I knew him 

3113
02:20:46,791 --> 02:20:47,624
and during that time.
And so I've taken quite a few trips up 

3114
02:20:50,751 --> 02:20:51,584
to montreal for the comedy festival to 
work at jimbos place and she'd go back 

3115
02:20:55,311 --> 02:20:56,900
and forth and do a bunch of gigs up 
there.

3116
02:20:57,430 --> 02:21:00,530
It just was a,
it was an important spot for me,

3117
02:21:00,580 --> 02:21:03,050
you know,
like jimbo was one of those guys that he

3118
02:21:03,051 --> 02:21:04,220
had a real eye for.

3119
02:21:04,220 --> 02:21:05,053
Like he,
he booked everyone before they were 

3120
02:21:07,971 --> 02:21:10,160
famous.
This is for people listening.

3121
02:21:10,310 --> 02:21:13,940
This is like a 85,
maybe 90 seat room,

3122
02:21:13,941 --> 02:21:15,440
like it's super small.
Yeah,

3123
02:21:15,441 --> 02:21:16,400
probably.
Maybe.

3124
02:21:16,401 --> 02:21:20,390
Maybe it stopped 100 maybe,
but he could have dumped him in there,

3125
02:21:20,690 --> 02:21:21,830
but he never asked.
Saw richard?

3126
02:21:21,831 --> 02:21:22,550
Jenny there,
dude.

3127
02:21:22,550 --> 02:21:24,320
Yeah.
Did you ever see jenny there?

3128
02:21:24,490 --> 02:21:28,420
I saw chris rock there.
I saw ray romano there guys.

3129
02:21:28,850 --> 02:21:30,990
I saw chris rock there as well.
Um,

3130
02:21:31,430 --> 02:21:35,210
I saw richard.
Jenny wants just level that place.

3131
02:21:35,450 --> 02:21:36,283
It was during a time where I was um,
I might've been like four years into 

3132
02:21:41,090 --> 02:21:41,970
comedy.
I was,

3133
02:21:42,010 --> 02:21:47,000
I was pretty new in the comedy and I was
up there with you during the festival.

3134
02:21:47,001 --> 02:21:48,620
You were just there?
I was doing the festival.

3135
02:21:48,621 --> 02:21:49,160
Okay.
Yeah.

3136
02:21:49,160 --> 02:21:54,160
Maybe I'll add maybe five years,
maybe was five years into comedy and uh,

3137
02:21:54,620 --> 02:21:57,260
richard jenny was a monster man.

3138
02:21:57,440 --> 02:21:58,273
He,
he is the one guy that I just repeat 

3139
02:22:00,381 --> 02:22:01,214
this over and over again because I don't
think people appreciate how fucking 

3140
02:22:03,170 --> 02:22:07,250
funny he was because he was,
he was kind of an odd guy who was just,

3141
02:22:07,350 --> 02:22:10,340
it was hard to find like a category 
where you fit it in.

3142
02:22:10,760 --> 02:22:11,593
But he was so fucking funny and he just 
lit that place on fire and I remember 

3143
02:22:15,710 --> 02:22:17,940
leaving his set going,
god damn,

3144
02:22:18,080 --> 02:22:22,280
it was terrible,
terrible.

3145
02:22:22,550 --> 02:22:23,383
But I absorbed something from it and one
thing was that that guy exhausted 

3146
02:22:27,870 --> 02:22:28,703
subjects like he would take a premise 
and exhausts that premise and smash it 

3147
02:22:33,091 --> 02:22:33,924
to the point where when he was on like 
this third wave of observation and 

3148
02:22:37,381 --> 02:22:38,730
punchlines,
you would just like,

3149
02:22:39,660 --> 02:22:40,493
you were in awe of the fact that he was 
continuing to beat down the subject as 

3150
02:22:44,851 --> 02:22:48,810
you were the writing and the punchlines.
It was also like the mastery,

3151
02:22:49,150 --> 02:22:53,110
his ability just master a premise and 
just just,

3152
02:22:53,190 --> 02:22:56,580
just dominate all the and take you off 
guard,

3153
02:22:56,760 --> 02:22:57,593
catch you off guard.
But you also agreed while he was saying 

3154
02:22:59,761 --> 02:23:01,290
it,
he was a wizard man.

3155
02:23:01,830 --> 02:23:04,440
I mean it's just sweet tight jokes,
man.

3156
02:23:05,220 --> 02:23:06,540
He was so god damn good.

3157
02:23:07,430 --> 02:23:12,230
That's how I am with ralphie may.
Like when I remember ralphie up,

3158
02:23:12,380 --> 02:23:16,790
I've never seen anyone get laughs.
Like ralph,

3159
02:23:16,791 --> 02:23:18,330
he got like,
he,

3160
02:23:18,960 --> 02:23:22,520
I get a series of shows with them like a
year or two before he died.

3161
02:23:23,090 --> 02:23:23,923
And the,
the walls felt like they were fucking 

3162
02:23:25,641 --> 02:23:30,290
shaking like I could I go,
like I was hosting the show and he was,

3163
02:23:30,291 --> 02:23:33,560
he was closing it and he wasn't supposed
to close at first.

3164
02:23:33,561 --> 02:23:34,880
But then he,
he was like,

3165
02:23:35,500 --> 02:23:36,820
it was gone too good.
They,

3166
02:23:36,821 --> 02:23:39,050
they had to make them close closing.
Before that,

3167
02:23:39,110 --> 02:23:40,880
it was a,
I forget who it was.

3168
02:23:40,940 --> 02:23:44,560
There was a,
I forget who was in America.

3169
02:23:44,780 --> 02:23:45,350
Uh,
no,

3170
02:23:45,350 --> 02:23:50,120
this was in montreal.
The nasty show at just for laughs.

3171
02:23:50,660 --> 02:23:55,660
I forget if it was jimmy carr or it was 
a brad williams one or the other,

3172
02:23:56,540 --> 02:23:58,150
but they,
the end,

3173
02:23:58,190 --> 02:24:00,380
whoever it was,
whether it was brad or,

3174
02:24:00,381 --> 02:24:03,020
or jimmy said the first night they were 
like,

3175
02:24:03,350 --> 02:24:04,183
he should fucking clothes.
Like he's got a close and every night I 

3176
02:24:07,040 --> 02:24:10,490
go in the room just to feel the energy 
of that room.

3177
02:24:10,520 --> 02:24:13,730
And since I'm from like,
like I've been living in montreal for 20

3178
02:24:13,731 --> 02:24:15,350
years.
I know that fucking room.

3179
02:24:15,351 --> 02:24:17,950
I've seen like marilyn manson in that 
real club soda.

3180
02:24:18,240 --> 02:24:19,730
No,
it's a metropolis.

3181
02:24:20,600 --> 02:24:22,460
Like I've been in that room.
Yeah.

3182
02:24:22,510 --> 02:24:23,343
I didn't ready room and that.
And if felt like the fucking walls were 

3183
02:24:26,631 --> 02:24:27,464
shaking,
it felt like the way when you were 

3184
02:24:28,251 --> 02:24:31,310
describing the earthquake,
that's how fucking ralphie

3185
02:24:31,660 --> 02:24:33,900
seen diaz kill.
Here's enjoyed ideas.

3186
02:24:33,910 --> 02:24:34,721
Kill.
I've never,

3187
02:24:34,721 --> 02:24:37,570
I've never been seen joey life.
Oh dude.

3188
02:24:37,571 --> 02:24:40,180
How long you in town for a.
We're leaving tomorrow.

3189
02:24:41,100 --> 02:24:43,390
Well,
if joey goes up tonight at the store,

3190
02:24:43,720 --> 02:24:46,390
I don't know if he's up.
That was a life changing thing.

3191
02:24:47,200 --> 02:24:48,910
He's the funniest guy I've ever seen.
Yeah.

3192
02:24:48,930 --> 02:24:50,970
I've never seen anybody killed.
Harder than joey diaz.

3193
02:24:51,010 --> 02:24:54,010
Never have to see it.
Okay.

3194
02:24:54,190 --> 02:24:55,150
If you think.
I mean ralph,

3195
02:24:55,151 --> 02:24:58,300
he was a funny guy.
Joey diaz is a force of nature.

3196
02:24:58,610 --> 02:24:59,443
It's a different thing.
This is not taking anything away from 

3197
02:25:01,511 --> 02:25:02,820
ralphie round.
Ralphie,

3198
02:25:04,150 --> 02:25:05,420
I'll fuck you up.
Joe rogan.

3199
02:25:05,450 --> 02:25:07,180
Jody.
Jody is a different thing,

3200
02:25:07,181 --> 02:25:08,480
man.
He'll,

3201
02:25:08,490 --> 02:25:10,000
he'll make you just go,
whoa.

3202
02:25:10,140 --> 02:25:10,720
What?
Cocaine.

3203
02:25:10,720 --> 02:25:12,550
That's comedy too.
Shit.

3204
02:25:12,690 --> 02:25:14,610
I fucking love listening.
Joe.

3205
02:25:14,790 --> 02:25:17,790
Like I've never met him.
But I love listening to him.

3206
02:25:17,910 --> 02:25:22,910
He sounds like he sounds like him.
That's what I loved about when I met him

3207
02:25:23,860 --> 02:25:24,010
the

3208
02:25:24,010 --> 02:25:25,300
first time.
I was like,

3209
02:25:25,301 --> 02:25:28,420
you sound like a,
like an old gangster.

3210
02:25:28,630 --> 02:25:29,463
Like you sound like,
I love guys that sound like they should 

3211
02:25:32,501 --> 02:25:33,700
be in fellas.
Yeah,

3212
02:25:33,701 --> 02:25:35,290
he definitely sounds like that.
Yeah.

3213
02:25:35,710 --> 02:25:36,543
Well he's,
he's legitimately seen more life and 

3214
02:25:39,401 --> 02:25:43,750
more chaos than probably any random 
thousand people.

3215
02:25:44,040 --> 02:25:45,520
Yeah.
He's got great stories.

3216
02:25:46,020 --> 02:25:46,940
New stories,
man.

3217
02:25:46,970 --> 02:25:49,840
He brings up new.
I've known the guy forever and I'll have

3218
02:25:49,841 --> 02:25:51,360
them on the podcast,
you know,

3219
02:25:51,430 --> 02:25:53,040
every few months.
And he has a new store.

3220
02:25:53,050 --> 02:25:55,150
I'm like,
how the fuck is this possible man?

3221
02:25:55,390 --> 02:25:58,040
And he's not a liar.
People are making sure doors.

3222
02:25:58,610 --> 02:26:00,160
No,
he doesn't.

3223
02:26:00,220 --> 02:26:02,140
I've met people.
They verify the stories.

3224
02:26:02,470 --> 02:26:05,290
He just lived a fucking insane life,
you know.

3225
02:26:05,740 --> 02:26:08,050
And you can tell when people make up 
their stories.

3226
02:26:08,140 --> 02:26:09,520
Fuck,
he's not a bullshitter.

3227
02:26:09,570 --> 02:26:10,403
Yeah,
no,

3228
02:26:10,450 --> 02:26:11,283
no,
he's not.

3229
02:26:11,560 --> 02:26:13,310
He's hilarious though.
It's um,

3230
02:26:13,510 --> 02:26:14,890
you know,
it's beautiful job,

3231
02:26:14,891 --> 02:26:15,190
man.

3232
02:26:15,190 --> 02:26:16,023
We get lucky.
Get to meet some really fascinating 

3233
02:26:17,231 --> 02:26:18,190
people.
We do.

3234
02:26:18,390 --> 02:26:19,223
Yeah.
So when did you guys start doing this 

3235
02:26:20,441 --> 02:26:24,250
show and compound media?
We started doing it about a year ago and

3236
02:26:24,251 --> 02:26:29,251
we started doing the free show about 
four months ago because we like,

3237
02:26:29,681 --> 02:26:30,514
um,
we want to get people to listen to the 

3238
02:26:32,621 --> 02:26:34,690
compound media.
How does compound media work?

3239
02:26:34,730 --> 02:26:35,563
Because compliment media,
you need to be a subscriber to the 

3240
02:26:37,601 --> 02:26:39,490
whole.
The whole net were much.

3241
02:26:39,491 --> 02:26:41,460
Does it cost?
It costs eight 95,

3242
02:26:41,480 --> 02:26:44,350
eight $95 a month.
Us and good.

3243
02:26:44,440 --> 02:26:49,000
How many shows you get a anthony kumi 
show up monday to thursday.

3244
02:26:49,001 --> 02:26:52,180
You get in hot water.
That's an amazing show.

3245
02:26:52,210 --> 02:26:55,000
It's a ehrenberg gino biscotti.
Four days a week.

3246
02:26:55,180 --> 02:26:57,790
You get about like 30 or 40 shows.
Yeah,

3247
02:26:57,791 --> 02:27:00,520
there's quite a few shows.
I met one of the hosts shoes on.

3248
02:27:01,040 --> 02:27:01,860
Well,
joanna.

3249
02:27:01,860 --> 02:27:02,693
Yeah.
So it was,

3250
02:27:02,930 --> 02:27:04,630
yeah,
she was on morning with bill schultz.

3251
02:27:05,140 --> 02:27:06,100
Joanna,
she's the one.

3252
02:27:06,200 --> 02:27:08,200
She's the,
she's the only female hosts that we have

3253
02:27:08,201 --> 02:27:11,300
on the network.
This is his new book yet this is um,

3254
02:27:11,450 --> 02:27:12,283
this,
uh,

3255
02:27:12,390 --> 02:27:14,620
there's something amazing,
better anthony columbia.

3256
02:27:14,621 --> 02:27:15,700
Like he,
like,

3257
02:27:15,701 --> 02:27:17,890
uh,
in the old days with opie and anthony,

3258
02:27:17,891 --> 02:27:18,724
he was like,
he helped out a bunch of young comics 

3259
02:27:21,730 --> 02:27:22,563
and he's trying to,
I think that that's kind of what he's 

3260
02:27:25,691 --> 02:27:29,260
doing with compound media and I'm 
calling myself a young comic even though

3261
02:27:29,261 --> 02:27:32,140
I'm a young 45 and I'm going to die in 
four months.

3262
02:27:32,141 --> 02:27:32,974
But well,
you mean people that are unestablished 

3263
02:27:35,500 --> 02:27:36,810
young comics?
Yeah.

3264
02:27:36,811 --> 02:27:38,980
Yeah.
It takes people that are established but

3265
02:27:38,981 --> 02:27:39,814
funny.
And he said he started doing things 

3266
02:27:41,231 --> 02:27:42,010
like,
like I'm,

3267
02:27:42,010 --> 02:27:46,870
I'm still based out of montreal and we 
were the only show that all the shows,

3268
02:27:46,871 --> 02:27:49,880
they do them in his studio in manhattan.
And then he,

3269
02:27:49,881 --> 02:27:50,681
uh,
he asked me,

3270
02:27:50,681 --> 02:27:51,520
do you want to do this?

3271
02:27:51,520 --> 02:27:54,640
And I didn't want to move to like go.
I got my wife,

3272
02:27:54,641 --> 02:27:56,800
I got my life in montreal.
I like montreal.

3273
02:27:57,330 --> 02:27:58,450
So I was like,
no,

3274
02:27:58,451 --> 02:28:00,880
I'm going to montreal.
But then he was like,

3275
02:28:00,910 --> 02:28:02,440
do it.
If you do the show,

3276
02:28:02,441 --> 02:28:04,720
you can do it from montreal.
And plus I,

3277
02:28:04,840 --> 02:28:05,890
I.
How'd you do it?

3278
02:28:05,920 --> 02:28:08,890
How do you have it set up?
We have a studio in a,

3279
02:28:08,891 --> 02:28:09,990
in a,
in a,

3280
02:28:10,390 --> 02:28:13,990
like a,
a park acts which is a neighborhood with

3281
02:28:13,991 --> 02:28:15,970
where he's from.
I don't tell people where you are,

3282
02:28:15,980 --> 02:28:18,740
bro.
They're going to attack us.

3283
02:28:19,330 --> 02:28:23,280
So he said,
but he has a studio and it,

3284
02:28:23,330 --> 02:28:26,120
we do this show every week and it's,
it's a lot of fun.

3285
02:28:26,810 --> 02:28:28,850
Cool.
So you just do,

3286
02:28:28,970 --> 02:28:30,500
they downloaded,
do you send it,

3287
02:28:30,510 --> 02:28:33,980
upload it to send it to them?
It doesn't stream,

3288
02:28:33,981 --> 02:28:34,950
live,
not.

3289
02:28:34,970 --> 02:28:39,970
We were the only show that isn't live 
and we never pretended like advantage of

3290
02:28:40,461 --> 02:28:40,880
that.

3291
02:28:40,880 --> 02:28:45,050
And do like weird splices where you go 
back in time and change clothes.

3292
02:28:45,051 --> 02:28:47,930
Don't say a word about it.
Well fuck is happening here.

3293
02:28:48,160 --> 02:28:48,993
Just change your tee shirt because I 
just saw this gentlemen just shows 100 

3294
02:28:52,701 --> 02:28:54,710
percent law.
That should be your joke call.

3295
02:28:54,711 --> 02:28:56,360
You should call your show 100 percent 
live.

3296
02:28:56,390 --> 02:29:01,390
I think the thing that people like 
because all of our fans are like old,

3297
02:29:02,061 --> 02:29:03,200
uh oh.
And a fence.

3298
02:29:03,470 --> 02:29:08,150
And I think what people like is our show
is not political at all.

3299
02:29:08,330 --> 02:29:09,163
And the like,
a lot of the stuff on competent media 

3300
02:29:11,600 --> 02:29:15,300
is,
is political and like people that,

3301
02:29:15,301 --> 02:29:16,134
like politico,
even people that like political stuff 

3302
02:29:18,290 --> 02:29:19,850
after awhile they're like,
okay,

3303
02:29:19,851 --> 02:29:21,170
I get it,
I get it.

3304
02:29:21,290 --> 02:29:25,040
Hillary's a cunt.
Can we laugh?

3305
02:29:25,100 --> 02:29:25,933
And that is both.
The compound media is like very right 

3306
02:29:26,961 --> 02:29:27,770
wing,
right?

3307
02:29:27,770 --> 02:29:28,603
There's no.
Is there any left wing like reno in the 

3308
02:29:31,131 --> 02:29:31,964
background?

3309
02:29:32,060 --> 02:29:33,800
Yeah,
we should get,

3310
02:29:33,980 --> 02:29:38,980
we should get it like a trends third mic
hold trans show.

3311
02:29:39,960 --> 02:29:41,240
Yeah.
No,

3312
02:29:42,220 --> 02:29:43,053
no,
but it's not as right wing as people 

3313
02:29:44,931 --> 02:29:46,070
think it is.
Well,

3314
02:29:46,130 --> 02:29:48,590
you know anthony's right wing,
but he's intelligent.

3315
02:29:49,070 --> 02:29:49,903
He's good,
sensible arguments whether you agree 

3316
02:29:51,411 --> 02:29:52,670
with them or not,
you know,

3317
02:29:52,671 --> 02:29:55,270
I'm not necessarily right wing at all.
And uh,

3318
02:29:55,280 --> 02:29:57,740
I liked talking to him and he's super 
funny.

3319
02:29:57,800 --> 02:29:58,633
That's one thing that people,
it's almost like in 2018 people have 

3320
02:30:02,330 --> 02:30:04,880
forgotten like what?
And I see this on the right.

3321
02:30:05,050 --> 02:30:08,330
Two people on the left field.
Shit on anthony or people on the right.

3322
02:30:08,510 --> 02:30:09,740
Oh shit.
On like a.

3323
02:30:10,020 --> 02:30:14,210
I like comics and I'll be like,
that's funny.

3324
02:30:14,240 --> 02:30:16,520
That's funny.
Like even if that's not how you think.

3325
02:30:16,550 --> 02:30:17,470
That's funny,
right?

3326
02:30:18,110 --> 02:30:20,600
Like sarah silverman,
a lot of people on the right.

3327
02:30:20,601 --> 02:30:23,810
Shit on sarah silverman.
Sarah silverman is fucking funny.

3328
02:30:23,840 --> 02:30:24,590
She's hilarious.

3329
02:30:24,590 --> 02:30:26,090
Very funny.
Common.

3330
02:30:26,480 --> 02:30:29,120
But you know what man,
they only with their shitting on.

3331
02:30:29,121 --> 02:30:32,120
There's only her political opinions.
It's just,

3332
02:30:32,150 --> 02:30:34,440
it's a nonsense war to get into,
you know,

3333
02:30:34,900 --> 02:30:36,920
do you do what do you want everybody to 
think to what you think,

3334
02:30:37,040 --> 02:30:38,750
you know?
And again,

3335
02:30:38,751 --> 02:30:40,160
it goes back to what we're talking about
earlier,

3336
02:30:40,161 --> 02:30:43,400
people just get on these teams and they 
want to hate everybody's on the team and

3337
02:30:43,430 --> 02:30:45,410
she's on team left,
so fuck that bitch.

3338
02:30:45,730 --> 02:30:46,563
And that's what happens.
That's probably the why we got to the 

3339
02:30:48,530 --> 02:30:49,363
top of the food chain that we grew up 
together and a operation and then we 

3340
02:30:54,231 --> 02:30:54,891
just,
okay,

3341
02:30:54,891 --> 02:30:57,380
well it's us versus them,
so we're going to win.

3342
02:30:57,500 --> 02:30:58,760
Yeah.
One hundred percent.

3343
02:30:59,120 --> 02:30:59,953
Yeah.
I'm william von hippel guy was on my 

3344
02:31:01,311 --> 02:31:03,920
show last week,
wrote a book called the social leap.

3345
02:31:04,070 --> 02:31:05,580
Yeah,
I listened to that episode,

3346
02:31:05,581 --> 02:31:06,414
but the book is essentially all about 
how human beings really succeeded by 

3347
02:31:10,640 --> 02:31:14,630
figuring out once we were some sort of 
weird primate thing that was close to us

3348
02:31:15,050 --> 02:31:18,550
by banding together and working in 
cooperation and that,

3349
02:31:18,551 --> 02:31:20,190
uh,
forming teams and

3350
02:31:20,250 --> 02:31:22,710
loyalty to the teams always rewarded.
I mean,

3351
02:31:22,711 --> 02:31:26,310
this is what you're seeing in politics.
You should see in social circles.

3352
02:31:26,700 --> 02:31:30,090
Even when you know with these crazy 
auntie for people and,

3353
02:31:30,300 --> 02:31:32,790
and proud boys.
It's all the same thing.

3354
02:31:32,820 --> 02:31:33,653
It's just tribal behavior.
You're seeing tribal behavior on the 

3355
02:31:35,941 --> 02:31:36,774
right from the proud boys tribal 
behavior on the left from antifa and 

3356
02:31:39,781 --> 02:31:42,580
everybody else is the enemy and they 
lash out and you know,

3357
02:31:42,600 --> 02:31:43,433
most of it is just completely misguided.
Most of all the aggression and the 

3358
02:31:47,041 --> 02:31:47,874
violence and the hate is so stupid and 
so misguided and counterproductive and 

3359
02:31:51,871 --> 02:31:52,704
even though they think like,
because in the moment it's such an 

3360
02:31:53,881 --> 02:31:56,370
impulsive,
childish thing to do with a lash out and

3361
02:31:56,550 --> 02:31:59,370
hit someone with a bike lock or punch 
someone sucker punch them,

3362
02:31:59,760 --> 02:32:03,780
but you,
all you're doing is feeding this fucking

3363
02:32:03,781 --> 02:32:06,000
machine.
It's never going to run out of fuel.

3364
02:32:06,001 --> 02:32:08,970
It's just going to keep chewing up our,
our culture.

3365
02:32:09,030 --> 02:32:11,140
It's going to just keep going.
It's your,

3366
02:32:11,220 --> 02:32:13,330
you're not going to end it.
You're not going to.

3367
02:32:13,670 --> 02:32:16,350
If you start punching people,
it keeps it.

3368
02:32:16,351 --> 02:32:18,350
You're feeding the beast.
Yeah,

3369
02:32:18,510 --> 02:32:19,343
they're going to punch back.
They're not going just going to punch 

3370
02:32:20,701 --> 02:32:21,750
back when they're going to kill you.

3371
02:32:22,100 --> 02:32:24,830
There's a thing.
I used to do a lot of shows for,

3372
02:32:25,010 --> 02:32:25,671
like,
I'm uh,

3373
02:32:25,671 --> 02:32:26,504
um,
um,

3374
02:32:26,690 --> 02:32:29,450
the people that liked me are generally 
men.

3375
02:32:29,690 --> 02:32:32,870
Like most of my fans are more men than 
women.

3376
02:32:33,020 --> 02:32:35,270
So I used to,
whenever I do corporate gigs,

3377
02:32:35,271 --> 02:32:40,271
the only corporate gigs I'd ever do,
we're shows for military police officers

3378
02:32:40,340 --> 02:32:43,280
or the hell's angels.
And now every time.

3379
02:32:43,460 --> 02:32:44,293
And the thing I realize is when you talk
to a group of cops or you talk to a 

3380
02:32:48,951 --> 02:32:52,070
group of hell's angels,
they're the same fucking guys,

3381
02:32:52,330 --> 02:32:53,163
the same guys because they got the same 
exact fucking mentality through their 

3382
02:32:56,390 --> 02:32:58,310
group.
The guys that are like,

3383
02:32:58,430 --> 02:33:00,020
okay,
it's us versus them.

3384
02:33:00,140 --> 02:33:00,871
We do this.
I,

3385
02:33:00,871 --> 02:33:01,940
right bro,
we're doing this,

3386
02:33:01,941 --> 02:33:04,480
we're doing this.
We're going in there and only difference

3387
02:33:04,481 --> 02:33:05,630
is you can call the cops.
No,

3388
02:33:05,631 --> 02:33:07,910
come here.
You just want to share.

3389
02:33:08,640 --> 02:33:09,910
Going to help me.
Well,

3390
02:33:09,930 --> 02:33:12,700
you're friends with him.
You called a friend.

3391
02:33:12,790 --> 02:33:13,623
I had a hotline.
You can call it like motorcycles rumble 

3392
02:33:15,920 --> 02:33:19,690
up and take care of your problem.
The I got into this uh,

3393
02:33:19,730 --> 02:33:20,720
thing.
Uh,

3394
02:33:20,721 --> 02:33:25,721
about 15 years ago back home I did a 
joke about it.

3395
02:33:25,890 --> 02:33:28,760
I did a joke on one of the galleries 
for,

3396
02:33:28,820 --> 02:33:32,660
for the festival and uh,
a reporter talk shit about me.

3397
02:33:32,770 --> 02:33:33,950
And,
and it was a joke.

3398
02:33:33,980 --> 02:33:37,180
All my jokes are about little kids.
So it was.

3399
02:33:37,460 --> 02:33:39,080
No,
it was a joke.

3400
02:33:39,081 --> 02:33:44,081
I done a joke that I mentioned a little 
girl that got kidnapped in my joke.

3401
02:33:46,080 --> 02:33:49,130
And the joke is good.
Yeah.

3402
02:33:49,340 --> 02:33:53,990
Fuck you always make me feel bad.
I'm going to give up comedy.

3403
02:33:54,200 --> 02:33:56,870
I fucking went out.
Joe rogan to give up comedy.

3404
02:33:57,110 --> 02:33:58,790
sorry.
I should commit suicide.

3405
02:33:58,870 --> 02:34:01,340
Me a hilarious joke about the little 
girl victim.

3406
02:34:01,400 --> 02:34:05,690
Go ahead a jump because it'd be a bit of
vet the little girl,

3407
02:34:05,930 --> 02:34:06,763
but it was a.
And the joke is going to suck now 

3408
02:34:09,140 --> 02:34:10,590
because it wouldn't have to explain the 
joke,

3409
02:34:10,820 --> 02:34:13,880
but it was a because I owed money to the
government,

3410
02:34:13,881 --> 02:34:16,160
the irs,
the canadian irs,

3411
02:34:16,340 --> 02:34:17,173
and uh,
they seized all my accounts and I had 

3412
02:34:19,331 --> 02:34:23,120
this little story and uh,
and that was the punchline was like,

3413
02:34:23,140 --> 02:34:25,420
they're fucking crazy.
If you owed them $8,

3414
02:34:25,421 --> 02:34:27,550
they're going to kidnap your kids.
They're the one that,

3415
02:34:27,820 --> 02:34:29,500
they're the ones that have blah,
blah,

3416
02:34:29,501 --> 02:34:30,820
blah.
And then name the little girl.

3417
02:34:31,060 --> 02:34:33,490
And now I've got a,
got a nice laugh.

3418
02:34:33,491 --> 02:34:36,610
And then it ended,
ended my set with a.

3419
02:34:36,760 --> 02:34:40,060
I got a standing ovation and the gala 
got good reviews.

3420
02:34:40,061 --> 02:34:43,090
Everything was good.
Then like three weeks later,

3421
02:34:43,091 --> 02:34:45,430
this reporter guy writes a,
uh,

3422
02:34:45,460 --> 02:34:49,300
an article about how the audience was 
shocked and offended.

3423
02:34:49,330 --> 02:34:51,430
And I was like,
they were shocked and offended.

3424
02:34:51,431 --> 02:34:54,610
I got a standing ovation and they were 
shocked and offended.

3425
02:34:54,820 --> 02:34:58,470
And then there was this a french 
canadian guy that's like a,

3426
02:34:58,510 --> 02:35:02,110
like a Larry King type guy.
He started his show.

3427
02:35:02,200 --> 02:35:04,990
He was like,
Mike Ward made fun of this little girl,

3428
02:35:05,170 --> 02:35:08,950
let's call her grandfather to see what 
he thinks about that joke.

3429
02:35:08,951 --> 02:35:11,080
So he called the grandfather during the 
show,

3430
02:35:11,560 --> 02:35:14,410
during the show.
He didn't tell the guy who's so.

3431
02:35:14,411 --> 02:35:15,071
He was like,
hey,

3432
02:35:15,071 --> 02:35:16,260
uh,
do you know Mike Ward?

3433
02:35:16,261 --> 02:35:17,380
And the guy was like,
yeah,

3434
02:35:17,950 --> 02:35:21,900
he made fun of a,
your granddaughter and this girl fucking

3435
02:35:22,280 --> 02:35:23,800
got kidnapped.
Like he was like,

3436
02:35:23,801 --> 02:35:24,910
well,
what do you think about that?

3437
02:35:24,940 --> 02:35:25,691
He was like,
well,

3438
02:35:25,691 --> 02:35:27,100
that's not cool.
Yeah,

3439
02:35:27,101 --> 02:35:27,934
no I have it isn't cool.
And then people lost and then people 

3440
02:35:32,051 --> 02:35:34,060
were calling in,
go like a fucking asshole.

3441
02:35:34,061 --> 02:35:35,920
What a piece of garbage and then people.

3442
02:35:35,920 --> 02:35:38,010
So you've got an issue.
People lost that.

3443
02:35:38,011 --> 02:35:39,630
I like make them fun.
The little kids,

3444
02:35:40,330 --> 02:35:41,163
people lost their fucking minds and then
people were sending messages to my 

3445
02:35:45,071 --> 02:35:47,980
manager that they knew where I lived.
They were going to murder me.

3446
02:35:48,310 --> 02:35:51,160
And then I look outside the house and my
manager calls me.

3447
02:35:51,161 --> 02:35:51,994
He's like,
there are people that are going to kill 

3448
02:35:52,991 --> 02:35:53,471
you.
And I was like,

3449
02:35:53,471 --> 02:35:55,270
they're not going to kill me.
I look at my house.

3450
02:35:55,450 --> 02:35:58,000
I see fucking people lined up outside of
my house.

3451
02:35:58,001 --> 02:35:58,691
I'm like,
oh fuck,

3452
02:35:58,691 --> 02:35:59,524
I'm gonna get murdered.
But lIke I was looking at them and they 

3453
02:36:02,111 --> 02:36:05,320
weren't attacking the house.
They were just like in front of my house

3454
02:36:05,321 --> 02:36:08,740
looking at my house and I was,
I'm not a brave dude.

3455
02:36:08,741 --> 02:36:09,574
Like I can't,
like,

3456
02:36:09,580 --> 02:36:12,040
like I'm not fucking you,
like I don't know how to fight.

3457
02:36:12,220 --> 02:36:13,053
So,
but I was like,

3458
02:36:13,130 --> 02:36:15,100
I'm just going to go talk to them to see
what the,

3459
02:36:15,160 --> 02:36:15,993
what the fuck's up.

3460
02:36:16,120 --> 02:36:20,740
So I went out and then they acted like 
they were just regular guys just hanging

3461
02:36:20,741 --> 02:36:22,270
out outside my house.
I was like,

3462
02:36:22,330 --> 02:36:23,163
what the fuck?
And then I found out like two or three 

3463
02:36:25,031 --> 02:36:25,864
years ago that I had done a couple shows
for hell's angels and the hell's angels 

3464
02:36:29,440 --> 02:36:34,440
had parked.
They told their dudes like Mike Ward,

3465
02:36:34,691 --> 02:36:36,370
there are people that want to kill Mike 
Ward.

3466
02:36:36,371 --> 02:36:37,204
So,
so watch the people that want to kill 

3467
02:36:38,861 --> 02:36:41,680
Mike Ward.
So the with the hell's angels,

3468
02:36:41,890 --> 02:36:46,090
like on my house is in the middle of the
street people,

3469
02:36:46,091 --> 02:36:46,924
the other side of the street and on each
corner that were hell's angels watching 

3470
02:36:49,811 --> 02:36:51,550
the people.
I was like,

3471
02:36:51,551 --> 02:36:56,020
fuck the hell's angels protected me.
it's wacky.

3472
02:36:56,320 --> 02:36:58,600
Yeah.
A lot of hell's angels are probably good

3473
02:36:58,601 --> 02:36:59,960
guys there.
They're like,

3474
02:36:59,970 --> 02:37:00,803
you're saying they're probably the same 
as the guys with the crops gang if you 

3475
02:37:03,940 --> 02:37:06,310
like.
And this is the same with mafia guys.

3476
02:37:06,460 --> 02:37:10,150
If you don't owe them money,
they're good guys.

3477
02:37:10,240 --> 02:37:15,240
They're good guys here with a message 
that's your business that's like,

3478
02:37:16,490 --> 02:37:18,470
they're all like,
like whenever,

3479
02:37:18,710 --> 02:37:22,670
whenever I meet anyone,
like in the mafia or whatever,

3480
02:37:22,820 --> 02:37:24,940
I'm like,
that doesn't seem like he's in the mafia

3481
02:37:24,941 --> 02:37:27,710
is a good guy,
but I don't own like $19,000.

3482
02:37:27,720 --> 02:37:28,500
Right,
right.

3483
02:37:28,500 --> 02:37:29,333
Yeah.
Well i'M sure a lot of organized crime 

3484
02:37:31,311 --> 02:37:34,430
and a lot of organized business,
they probably behave pretty similar.

3485
02:37:34,670 --> 02:37:35,910
Yeah,
because it's a business.

3486
02:37:35,930 --> 02:37:37,670
Things they can get away with and things
that they can't.

3487
02:37:37,671 --> 02:37:38,310
Yeah,
you can.

3488
02:37:38,310 --> 02:37:41,390
If you just go around,
go around breaking legs and killing pill

3489
02:37:41,391 --> 02:37:44,730
you then they'll kill your kids.
Goddamn business.

3490
02:37:45,420 --> 02:37:49,550
Goddamn goddamn goddamn business.
Alright gents.

3491
02:37:49,730 --> 02:37:51,500
Let's wrap this pitch up.
Doing this forever.

3492
02:37:51,600 --> 02:37:52,760
Um,
but uh,

3493
02:37:53,450 --> 02:37:54,283
when do you think this thing's going to 
get resolved with the thing that's 

3494
02:37:56,841 --> 02:37:58,550
weird.
Like when I went to court,

3495
02:37:58,551 --> 02:37:59,384
this have fucking stupid I am.
I thought it'd be like oj that at the 

3496
02:38:02,950 --> 02:38:03,783
end of my,
my trial they'd be like case stand up 

3497
02:38:05,541 --> 02:38:07,250
and we go,
we vote for you.

3498
02:38:07,430 --> 02:38:12,050
But in Canada they,
we get the verdict like for six or eight

3499
02:38:12,051 --> 02:38:15,560
months later.
So I'm going back to court early january

3500
02:38:15,650 --> 02:38:18,890
and then I'll probably get the verdict 
in a year or two.

3501
02:38:19,660 --> 02:38:24,660
Like it's really like I'm going to be 97
by the timE I get the money is just cost

3502
02:38:26,181 --> 02:38:28,310
costing you so far.
It's going to cost me like,

3503
02:38:28,390 --> 02:38:29,223
like I said,
bruce from the like it's going to cost 

3504
02:38:32,481 --> 02:38:33,314
probably 200,000,
210 and this is the thing I want to 

3505
02:38:36,411 --> 02:38:39,140
start a.
I just paid off 20.

3506
02:38:39,410 --> 02:38:40,243
I could have paid off,
I could have paid off 10 times if I 

3507
02:38:42,351 --> 02:38:44,090
wanted to,
but here's the thing,

3508
02:38:44,120 --> 02:38:47,360
what I want to do,
I was really lucky that a,

3509
02:38:47,361 --> 02:38:49,910
and I'm a guy that always sees the glass
half full,

3510
02:38:50,240 --> 02:38:51,590
but uh,
I,

3511
02:38:51,730 --> 02:38:55,550
I was lucky that I had the money to pay 
this because if I was a guy,

3512
02:38:55,551 --> 02:38:56,384
like there was three or four years into 
comedy and someone sent me a letter to 

3513
02:39:00,111 --> 02:39:00,591
say,
hey,

3514
02:39:00,591 --> 02:39:01,700
you owe 80.

3515
02:39:01,700 --> 02:39:03,800
I would have fucking either committed 
suicide,

3516
02:39:03,801 --> 02:39:07,100
quit comedy,
or four years into comedy you'd probably

3517
02:39:07,101 --> 02:39:10,250
be more inclined to say something 
inappropriate because you thought it was

3518
02:39:10,251 --> 02:39:11,001
funny.
Yeah,

3519
02:39:11,001 --> 02:39:12,140
it'd be shocking.
Yeah.

3520
02:39:12,290 --> 02:39:14,980
Right.
Like you get rewarded what,

3521
02:39:15,020 --> 02:39:18,140
especially when you do open mic nights 
and you're just starting out,

3522
02:39:18,170 --> 02:39:22,130
you get rewarded in taking chances that 
aren't necessarily Funny,

3523
02:39:22,340 --> 02:39:23,450
but there are shocking.
Yeah.

3524
02:39:23,451 --> 02:39:27,280
You're risky because it might be the 
best reaction of your set.

3525
02:39:27,281 --> 02:39:29,660
It's not.
Might not even be necessarily good,

3526
02:39:30,140 --> 02:39:30,973
but it's the best reaction of your set 
because frankly your set is mostly dog 

3527
02:39:34,461 --> 02:39:36,920
shit,
right when you're two or three years in.

3528
02:39:36,980 --> 02:39:38,030
Right?
Yeah.

3529
02:39:38,120 --> 02:39:38,953
So imagine that gets on the internet 
some three year old comic is barely 

3530
02:39:43,730 --> 02:39:44,563
stage legs under him dropping bombs.
Just saying something stupid that you 

3531
02:39:48,021 --> 02:39:49,760
think you're going to be funny.
Yeah,

3532
02:39:49,950 --> 02:39:51,740
I'd want to.
I want to start a thing though.

3533
02:39:51,741 --> 02:39:54,440
I haven't started yet because I was gone
through the depression.

3534
02:39:54,441 --> 02:39:55,274
I've been talking about this for years,
but now since I'm not in my depression 

3535
02:39:57,770 --> 02:40:01,790
I'm going to start a fund for whoever 
the next guy or next girl,

3536
02:40:01,910 --> 02:40:06,080
next woman is going to go broke so 
they're going to be a storm of them.

3537
02:40:06,410 --> 02:40:08,480
But I think because uh,
because uh,

3538
02:40:08,540 --> 02:40:09,373
like,
like I was lucky I think of myself as 

3539
02:40:11,480 --> 02:40:14,220
lucky for real cause like I don't have a
lot

3540
02:40:14,220 --> 02:40:15,053
of money but I had enough money to 
defend myself and I didn't even have to 

3541
02:40:18,841 --> 02:40:19,910
go like,
ah,

3542
02:40:19,950 --> 02:40:23,070
fuck it in any way.
Raise your profile to help you.

3543
02:40:23,330 --> 02:40:27,960
It would have helped me if I didn't 
spend all my days in the bathtub crying,

3544
02:40:27,990 --> 02:40:29,520
drinking wine.
Like,

3545
02:40:29,550 --> 02:40:31,680
like if,
if I had used this,

3546
02:40:31,860 --> 02:40:33,020
I could've,
I could've.

3547
02:40:33,090 --> 02:40:35,460
I don't know if I would have become like
super famous,

3548
02:40:35,670 --> 02:40:37,410
but I could have used this,
but I was like,

3549
02:40:37,470 --> 02:40:38,760
I didn't,
I didn't want to use this.

3550
02:40:38,761 --> 02:40:39,594
I didn't want to be.
I didn't want to be the guy that made 

3551
02:40:42,151 --> 02:40:43,650
fun of disabled children

3552
02:40:44,260 --> 02:40:45,450
too late.
I don't know.

3553
02:40:47,530 --> 02:40:48,460
yeah,
I get it,

3554
02:40:48,461 --> 02:40:49,294
man.
I mean,

3555
02:40:49,360 --> 02:40:51,390
I think that's a real noble idea to,
to,

3556
02:40:51,440 --> 02:40:52,273
to start a fund for the next guy and 
especially because Canada has such a 

3557
02:40:55,601 --> 02:40:57,710
wonky system.
Canada,

3558
02:40:57,711 --> 02:40:59,260
you're,
you're basically conneCted.

3559
02:40:59,560 --> 02:41:01,420
We're all together.
We were.

3560
02:41:01,510 --> 02:41:04,300
You guys were right here.
Yeah.

3561
02:41:05,610 --> 02:41:10,610
Basically Vermont with crazy last 11 
human rights commissions because there's

3562
02:41:11,701 --> 02:41:12,534
the canadian human rights commission and
every canadian province has their human 

3563
02:41:16,201 --> 02:41:20,340
rights commission and there in the world
there are 12 human rights commission,

3564
02:41:20,341 --> 02:41:21,174
so there's the one at the hague that 
they go after evil war criminals and 

3565
02:41:24,961 --> 02:41:25,794
shit and then they're a leaven in Canada
that go after open milkers and Jordan 

3566
02:41:30,880 --> 02:41:32,110
Peterson and they go after me.
I think

3567
02:41:32,220 --> 02:41:33,053
thiS is.
We can make comparisons to what they're 

3568
02:41:35,521 --> 02:41:36,354
doing with free speech to what we deem 
to be the real issues with controlling 

3569
02:41:40,501 --> 02:41:43,230
free speech on the internet.
I think there's real similarities.

3570
02:41:43,620 --> 02:41:46,260
I think having these human rights 
councils,

3571
02:41:46,470 --> 02:41:47,303
committees,
people getting together and decide and 

3572
02:41:48,631 --> 02:41:51,900
they don't want to come off callous or 
ruthless or you know,

3573
02:41:51,901 --> 02:41:54,750
and so they can decide,
well that's gone too far.

3574
02:41:55,140 --> 02:41:57,360
This is wrong.
You shouldn't be able to say that.

3575
02:41:57,750 --> 02:42:00,780
That is the number one problem with 
controlling free speech.

3576
02:42:00,890 --> 02:42:01,723
Like you should be able to say whatever 
you want and then if people don't like 

3577
02:42:04,021 --> 02:42:04,854
you,
then they'll watch you or they don't go 

3578
02:42:06,361 --> 02:42:09,510
see you and you let the free market 
decide.

3579
02:42:09,790 --> 02:42:13,170
It's not about.
We're not talking about inciting,

3580
02:42:13,171 --> 02:42:15,330
hey are saying you should go kill 
people.

3581
02:42:15,510 --> 02:42:16,343
One of the things that a lot of people 
had a problem with with gavin was gavin 

3582
02:42:18,781 --> 02:42:20,400
was actually saying punch them.

3583
02:42:20,880 --> 02:42:21,713
Hit them.
That's fucking crazy because he's not 

3584
02:42:23,401 --> 02:42:25,680
used to being punched and hit.
That's what it is.

3585
02:42:25,890 --> 02:42:26,723
People that are around violence a lot,
don't just willy nilly advocate 

3586
02:42:30,901 --> 02:42:32,310
violence,
you know,

3587
02:42:32,311 --> 02:42:33,144
and I think he realizes that's probably 
why he stepped down from this whole 

3588
02:42:35,731 --> 02:42:37,580
thing now because he realizes like,
oh,

3589
02:42:37,940 --> 02:42:38,773
it's probably hard to see how you're 
perceived when you're in that fucking 

3590
02:42:42,391 --> 02:42:46,710
polarizing a position as he is that he 
just was at one point in time.

3591
02:42:46,711 --> 02:42:48,240
The guy who was one of the cofounders 
advice.

3592
02:42:48,450 --> 02:42:51,380
It's really kind of weird,
interesting provocate tour guys.

3593
02:42:51,390 --> 02:42:53,610
Very smart.
I enjoy talking to him,

3594
02:42:54,300 --> 02:42:56,340
to this guy who's like,
all right,

3595
02:42:56,400 --> 02:42:58,440
and you know,
the leader of a hate group.

3596
02:42:58,441 --> 02:43:00,960
Like what?
That shit sticks to you man.

3597
02:43:01,060 --> 02:43:01,850
Yeah,
I mean that's.

3598
02:43:01,850 --> 02:43:04,290
It sticks to you like crazy glue.
Yeah.

3599
02:43:05,730 --> 02:43:08,870
I don't always going to do,
but I think what we were saying earlier,

3600
02:43:08,871 --> 02:43:11,950
it's like that perceptions,
some sometimes

3601
02:43:12,010 --> 02:43:12,843
almost as important as reality and in 
your case may prove to be until wore 

3602
02:43:16,750 --> 02:43:17,583
off,
right?

3603
02:43:17,830 --> 02:43:18,663
Yeah.
Like now I'm it people forgotten and 

3604
02:43:22,061 --> 02:43:23,980
people see the thing that,
that,

3605
02:43:24,130 --> 02:43:26,740
like I said,
when we were starting out the podcast,

3606
02:43:27,160 --> 02:43:30,940
the thing that kind of pissed me off is 
like in America,

3607
02:43:30,941 --> 02:43:32,620
I like that.
And in quebec,

3608
02:43:32,621 --> 02:43:36,600
which is french Canada,
they saw me as a guy that that would.

3609
02:43:36,880 --> 02:43:38,410
I do jokes,
but I'm,

3610
02:43:38,411 --> 02:43:39,244
I'm offensive,
I'm a fucking dirty comic and I do what 

3611
02:43:41,741 --> 02:43:42,574
I do and I think I do well.
People enjoy that kind of comedy and 

3612
02:43:44,840 --> 02:43:47,220
they were.
They enjoyed gangster rap the same way.

3613
02:43:47,230 --> 02:43:48,063
They enjoy violent movies.
I'm not like some shitty like fucking 

3614
02:43:52,091 --> 02:43:55,390
open mike are doing rape jokes that 
don't work.

3615
02:43:55,540 --> 02:43:57,520
If I do rape jokes,
my rape jokes,

3616
02:43:57,550 --> 02:43:59,710
fucking murder,
rape jokes,

3617
02:43:59,711 --> 02:44:03,940
kill.
Like I've won like fucking 15 awards.

3618
02:44:04,630 --> 02:44:08,150
Every rape,
rape joke of the year award,

3619
02:44:09,570 --> 02:44:10,720
but,
but people,

3620
02:44:10,780 --> 02:44:14,980
people like a lot of the media instead 
of going,

3621
02:44:15,160 --> 02:44:15,993
there's something weird about the 
government because the government 

3622
02:44:18,760 --> 02:44:22,630
judging my case is exactly like judging 
a movie.

3623
02:44:22,690 --> 02:44:23,523
It's like saying fucking why?
Why are they driving so fast and fast 

3624
02:44:27,221 --> 02:44:32,140
and the furious why they forgot that 
what I do,

3625
02:44:32,200 --> 02:44:35,140
even if you don't like what I do is art.
Yeah,

3626
02:44:35,350 --> 02:44:38,140
and you,
you might not think standup is art,

3627
02:44:38,141 --> 02:44:40,060
but it is,
it's a fucking expression.

3628
02:44:40,150 --> 02:44:40,983
And I were talking about this earlier 
that it just seems too much like you're 

3629
02:44:43,001 --> 02:44:45,640
just talking cause cause here's the 
thing.

3630
02:44:45,760 --> 02:44:48,760
Whenever you see a comic that that's 
good,

3631
02:44:48,790 --> 02:44:51,760
it looks easy and when it looks easy it 
looks like they just,

3632
02:44:51,761 --> 02:44:53,920
it's off the top of their head and 
that's what they think.

3633
02:44:54,130 --> 02:44:54,963
And that's a thing.
I think it was jim jefferies that said 

3634
02:44:56,711 --> 02:44:57,544
this,
that he said there are things that I 

3635
02:45:00,940 --> 02:45:05,590
think and there what I sound stage or 
things that I think are funny and that's

3636
02:45:05,591 --> 02:45:07,460
what we do on stage.
Like it.

3637
02:45:07,470 --> 02:45:09,400
It's not a check.
That was me too.

3638
02:45:09,460 --> 02:45:11,700
Those are my specials are exactly the 
same.

3639
02:45:12,040 --> 02:45:13,000
Probably you.
All right.

3640
02:45:13,001 --> 02:45:13,910
So jim jeffries.

3641
02:45:16,060 --> 02:45:16,893
But it's.
Everybody says that he had a fucking 

3642
02:45:18,310 --> 02:45:20,860
good bit about vegan.
Catsa was awesome.

3643
02:45:22,450 --> 02:45:24,790
When can people watch your show?
Oh they can see it.

3644
02:45:24,930 --> 02:45:29,490
I'm on amazon prime in the us and uk.
Uh,

3645
02:45:29,540 --> 02:45:31,000
the stand up show.
Yeah,

3646
02:45:31,001 --> 02:45:33,250
it's called.
It's called a Mike Ward.

3647
02:45:33,251 --> 02:45:34,084
Infamous.
And my first 15 minutes are about my 

3648
02:45:36,281 --> 02:45:37,870
court case.
It's a really good special.

3649
02:45:37,871 --> 02:45:42,040
I'm super happy with this special.
It's the exact opposite of nanette.

3650
02:45:42,280 --> 02:45:46,140
So amazon prime is amazon prime when lot
of standup,

3651
02:45:46,150 --> 02:45:46,983
right?
It's like the retarded version of 

3652
02:45:48,251 --> 02:45:50,650
netflix.
Where let you say retarded.

3653
02:45:50,710 --> 02:45:52,600
Yeah,
they let me say retired.

3654
02:45:55,040 --> 02:45:58,000
I was on the phone right now.
What did he say?

3655
02:45:58,060 --> 02:46:01,090
So in three weeks I'm going to be on.
I'm going to be on hulu.

3656
02:46:01,260 --> 02:46:03,370
Yeah,
very liberal.

3657
02:46:03,590 --> 02:46:05,410
They have handmaid's tale.
You're fucked.

3658
02:46:06,070 --> 02:46:07,600
If not.
We were a,

3659
02:46:07,630 --> 02:46:10,160
were a friday,
friday four to six

3660
02:46:10,160 --> 02:46:10,993
on compound media.
Doesn't gavin's still have a show on 

3661
02:46:13,131 --> 02:46:16,520
like crt tv or some crtc crtv?
Yeah.

3662
02:46:16,550 --> 02:46:19,160
What is it still hasn't yet?
He still has it.

3663
02:46:19,530 --> 02:46:20,363
I,
I've already talked to gavin in like 

3664
02:46:21,770 --> 02:46:23,330
over a year,
like a.

3665
02:46:23,370 --> 02:46:26,690
And the last time he wrote me he wrote a
funny,

3666
02:46:26,750 --> 02:46:30,710
like I thought it was.
He wrote this weird fucking thing that I

3667
02:46:30,711 --> 02:46:33,140
could tell that he was drunk and I was 
like,

3668
02:46:33,141 --> 02:46:35,540
no way.
He wrote me like a four in the morning,

3669
02:46:35,750 --> 02:46:37,760
some fucking random thing and I was 
like,

3670
02:46:37,880 --> 02:46:42,170
I'm happy to see you're drinking again.
And then he wrote something,

3671
02:46:42,171 --> 02:46:43,004
stopped drinking for awhile.
He had stopped drinking for awhile and 

3672
02:46:44,751 --> 02:46:48,320
then he wrote something like almost 
insulting me and that I wrote,

3673
02:46:48,330 --> 02:46:50,330
ha ha ha.
And then he wrote a,

3674
02:46:50,331 --> 02:46:53,180
you're too hard to.
You're too hard to piss off.

3675
02:46:53,181 --> 02:46:54,410
I'm going to write someone else.

3676
02:46:55,490 --> 02:46:57,370
So he was just,
he was an a plus my,

3677
02:46:57,440 --> 02:46:58,273
since my name is ward,
like I was probably like at the end of 

3678
02:47:00,681 --> 02:47:03,110
the list,
so he had to call some guy named.

3679
02:47:03,111 --> 02:47:06,740
Some manco are going through all of his 
different fucking contexts,

3680
02:47:07,750 --> 02:47:09,290
contexts.
And that's funny.

3681
02:47:09,350 --> 02:47:11,180
Yeah.
All right gentlemen,

3682
02:47:12,140 --> 02:47:13,220
thanks for being here,
man.

3683
02:47:14,100 --> 02:47:15,740
Fight.
Thank you Canada.

3684
02:47:15,770 --> 02:47:19,340
Get your goddamn shit together when it 
comes to freedom of expression.

3685
02:47:19,520 --> 02:47:22,250
This is nonsense.
You silly goose geese.

3686
02:47:22,990 --> 02:47:25,460
Call the most amazing country.
Other than that,

3687
02:47:25,820 --> 02:47:27,710
so nice up.
There it is.

3688
02:47:27,960 --> 02:47:30,920
Fucking free speech in line.
Alright,

3689
02:47:31,340 --> 02:47:32,173
bye everybody.
