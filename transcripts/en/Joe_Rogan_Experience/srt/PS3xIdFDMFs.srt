1
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:02,040
Sure.

2
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:04,450
Are we live?
Oh my goodness.

3
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:05,770
Rich Roll.
Ladies and gentlemen.

4
00:00:05,771 --> 00:00:07,240
How are you buddy?
Good to see Ya.

5
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:09,040
What's cracking?
Happy to be here,

6
00:00:09,041 --> 00:00:11,250
man.
I'm drinking green juice interview.

7
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,790
I hope that's in my honor.
Sort of.

8
00:00:12,791 --> 00:00:14,710
I drink it every day,
but appreciate that helps.

9
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:17,620
Where'd you pick that up?
Juicy lady.

10
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:18,060
Yeah,
yeah,

11
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:19,000
yeah.
You know what that is?

12
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:20,140
I do.
I go there all the time.

13
00:00:20,141 --> 00:00:22,420
I love that place.
I wish I changed the name of it,

14
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,150
but a juicy ladies.
I don't know why it's.

15
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,640
I think a lady owns it.
Yeah.

16
00:00:27,641 --> 00:00:28,660
Now she's cool.
Actually.

17
00:00:28,661 --> 00:00:30,020
I like it,
but yeah,

18
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:32,320
the food there is pretty good.
It's a little sexual.

19
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:37,490
Yeah.
The name or is it an assault of your 

20
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:37,490
masculinity?
No,

21
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:37,650
no.
I'm cool with that,

22
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:40,720
but some weaker men might have an issue.
You have to be selfish.

23
00:00:40,721 --> 00:00:44,440
You have to be strong enough to go in 
there and order Vegan food.

24
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,180
They do,
but they make a good green juice.

25
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,530
Yeah.
They make a lot of good stuff there.

26
00:00:47,531 --> 00:00:52,531
It's a good spot where there's more and 
more of those places that are opening 

27
00:00:52,531 --> 00:00:55,501
up.
If Mcdonald's is going to offer a Kale 

28
00:00:55,501 --> 00:00:55,501
shake,
no way.

29
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:58,360
That's changing though.
Well,

30
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:00,730
something's working well.
We're getting nutrients in their body.

31
00:01:00,731 --> 00:01:01,810
It's crazy.
Starbucks.

32
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:04,990
Starbucks has what?
Get the fuck out.

33
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:05,820
I didn't know that.
Yeah,

34
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:08,350
get the fuck Outta here.
Evo Green things.

35
00:01:08,351 --> 00:01:10,930
It makes it up with a yogurt and fresh 
Kale if you want it to,

36
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,590
but why would they put yogurt in it?
Because it makes it a smoother start.

37
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,480
Starbucks makes us.
Well,

38
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:22,510
you know the market.
The market will dictate it if people 

39
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:26,101
want.
It started like when you talk about 

40
00:01:26,101 --> 00:01:26,410
conspiracy theories with evil 
corporations,

41
00:01:26,411 --> 00:01:28,540
it's like they're responding to what 
people want.

42
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:29,770
You know?
That is true.

43
00:01:29,771 --> 00:01:31,630
People want it.
They're going to start making it.

44
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:36,990
That's the whole conspiracy with really 
shitty television shows to like people 

45
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:37,750
like men.
They're trying to make us dumb.

46
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:42,070
Nope.
Already dumb like you have to do is look

47
00:01:42,071 --> 00:01:47,071
at the ratings and see what people are 
actually watching it and they're 

48
00:01:47,071 --> 00:01:47,071
responding to that.

49
00:01:47,071 --> 00:01:47,140
Well,
people are tired.

50
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:49,180
They get home from work,
they're exhausted.

51
00:01:49,181 --> 00:01:51,520
They don't want to watch cosmos or some 
of them do.

52
00:01:51,521 --> 00:01:53,320
I do,
but some people just want to,

53
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:58,680
they just want to zone out and watch 
honey booboo or I don't think that's 

54
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,260
right anymore.
There's always a new one.

55
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,730
But yeah,
we uh,

56
00:02:00,731 --> 00:02:02,990
we got rid of our TVS.
Yeah,

57
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,800
like are you like a year ago?
But believe me,

58
00:02:05,801 --> 00:02:08,620
I did not want to do.
It was not my idea.

59
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:14,370
I was uh,
I was quite vociferous in opposing that 

60
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:14,680
idea.
That was my wife's idea.

61
00:02:14,681 --> 00:02:17,530
But actually it's just like anything 
else you adjust to it.

62
00:02:17,531 --> 00:02:22,531
I mean I still watch Netflix and I watch
the shows I like to watch and now I 

63
00:02:22,531 --> 00:02:22,531
don't,
I don't miss it.

64
00:02:22,531 --> 00:02:27,240
And I have total,
like when I've been traveling a lot and 

65
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:27,240
you know,
when you're in hotel rooms,

66
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:31,270
he turned the TV on and I have a zero 
tolerance policy for commercials now.

67
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:33,640
Like I'm like really,
you know,

68
00:02:33,641 --> 00:02:36,550
and I just turned the TV off and go back
online.

69
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,680
Yeah,
commercials are fucking brutal.

70
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:43,710
Whoever invented the idea of stopping a 
show every 15 minutes for three minutes 

71
00:02:44,291 --> 00:02:45,760
or whatever the hell it is for 
commercials.

72
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:47,170
That's awful.
Well,

73
00:02:47,171 --> 00:02:50,050
it's crazy how you acclimate to that 
because as a kid,

74
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:52,420
you know,
think about how many hours of your life,

75
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:58,330
you know,
we're just basically watching 

76
00:02:58,330 --> 00:02:58,330
commercials.
Well,

77
00:02:58,330 --> 00:02:58,330
you know what happened though,
dvrs,

78
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,100
dvrs made commercials really stupid.

79
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,780
That's still.
I mean we're about the same age,

80
00:03:01,781 --> 00:03:06,781
right?
So that's still a recent development in 

81
00:03:06,781 --> 00:03:06,781
our life.
You know,

82
00:03:06,781 --> 00:03:09,670
most of our formative years was terrible
television commercials.

83
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:14,700
Yeah.
I got my first vo in the early two 

84
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,801
thousands.
It was like a standalone unit that 

85
00:03:16,801 --> 00:03:17,890
hooked up to direct TV.
I think it was like,

86
00:03:17,891 --> 00:03:20,440
I want to say like 2003 or something 
like that.

87
00:03:20,441 --> 00:03:22,710
And I was like,
this is amazing.

88
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:27,250
You can pause the TV now.
You can pause it and go take a leak.

89
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:32,460
You could record things.
You could find search things and have 

90
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:34,090
them on a schedule.
Because I fucking.

91
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:39,150
I had probably 10 vcrs in my life and 
never figured out how to record one of 

92
00:03:39,731 --> 00:03:42,550
those pitches.
This flashing 12:00,

93
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:46,460
I'd never scheduled one of them.
I never had one of them scheduled,

94
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,760
unlike anybody figured that out.
Some people must have.

95
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:50,880
It's cool how it's changing,
I mean,

96
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:52,380
you know,
to see how,

97
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:57,430
how you know,
what's going on with Netflix and Amazon 

98
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:57,430
and all that kind of stuff.
And,

99
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:59,820
and most recently what Tim Ferriss has 
done with his show,

100
00:03:59,821 --> 00:04:02,430
have you followed that at all?
Which was so,

101
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:06,300
so tim had a show called the Tim Ferriss
experiment in an era on.

102
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:08,280
I can't remember what.
Yeah,

103
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:08,680
it was,
uh,

104
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:09,030
it was,
uh,

105
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:11,820
it was like a,
another channel that was part of the CNN

106
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,270
headline news or it wasn't headline news
where it was something like that.

107
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,380
It went under.
Right.

108
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:21,381
And so his show was,
I don't know how many episodes had 

109
00:04:21,381 --> 00:04:21,990
aired,
but certainly not the entire 13,

110
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:23,430
you know,
of the season.

111
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:24,960
And then it was just,
you know,

112
00:04:24,961 --> 00:04:26,790
how it is an entertainment like you're 
just done,

113
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:28,140
right.
They own the show.

114
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:31,410
And even though they were all taped and 
locked in and completed,

115
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,700
nobody had seen them and somehow he was 
able to get,

116
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:37,860
get his show back and he,
he,

117
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:38,660
I dunno,
you know,

118
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:41,650
through loitering or what have you.
And uh,

119
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:46,670
bought the rights back,
got his show and cut a deal with itunes 

120
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:50,361
and it's premiered on itunes this past 
week and I think it's like the top 

121
00:04:50,361 --> 00:04:52,080
ranked TV show on itunes

122
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,040
now you can watch the TV show rankings 
though,

123
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:58,110
or just like their podcast rankings,
you know.

124
00:04:58,370 --> 00:04:59,180
Well,
who knows how the,

125
00:04:59,181 --> 00:05:01,280
it knows that algorithm works well.
It does.

126
00:05:01,281 --> 00:05:03,500
It's definitely not based on the number 
of downloads.

127
00:05:03,501 --> 00:05:04,490
No,
it's definitely not.

128
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:07,410
It's based on new,
like it,

129
00:05:07,411 --> 00:05:10,790
it knew it takes precedent,
new subscribers and,

130
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,980
and also uh,
comments.

131
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:18,430
So like Chelsea Peretti had the number 
one podcast in the country and she 

132
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:19,730
hadn't even released an episode yet.
Right.

133
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:23,870
So zero had been downloaded and they 
also put subscribed.

134
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:26,570
They overinflate new shows.
Someone,

135
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:31,590
somebody premiers a show with one or two
episodes that it's like super high up 

136
00:05:31,601 --> 00:05:34,330
for awhile before it settles into where 
it should be.

137
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:39,640
I think that's good because it doesn't 
keep anybody from downloading other 

138
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:43,441
shows that are already popular.
And it does give new shows like a 

139
00:05:43,441 --> 00:05:43,870
window.
But like,

140
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:45,730
you'll see people,
I'm number one,

141
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,040
like you'll see like these bright like 
come on man.

142
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:49,900
Like do you know what that means?
What is it?

143
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:52,000
What are your numbers?
How many downloads?

144
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:53,980
EA?
Definitely not number one there.

145
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:56,310
It's weird.
The rankings is weird.

146
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:58,220
It was all over the,
like my show

147
00:05:58,220 --> 00:05:59,400
this week.
Uh,

148
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:03,590
it's got a banner on the top carousel of
Itunes,

149
00:06:03,591 --> 00:06:08,591
on the itunes homepage for podcasts.
So my numbers went way up this week and 

150
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:12,080
overall rankings,
but I know that's not real.

151
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,900
You know,
it'll settle back down and then we will.

152
00:06:14,901 --> 00:06:15,780
But it won't,
you know,

153
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:17,030
it will,
but it'll build,

154
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:22,210
you know,
I remember when we first started doing 

155
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:22,210
this podcast,
I don't know what our downloads were.

156
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:23,300
There were,
there were nothing though.

157
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,240
It was like,
you know,

158
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:28,070
a few thousand here or there.
And then one day it was like,

159
00:06:28,071 --> 00:06:33,071
oh,
we're getting a million downloads a 

160
00:06:33,071 --> 00:06:33,071
month.
What?

161
00:06:33,071 --> 00:06:35,150
A million.
And now it's somewhere around 14 

162
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:35,150
million.
Is it really?

163
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:35,150
Yeah.
What's your,

164
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:38,570
what's your average download per show?
You can you talk about that ends?

165
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:42,290
It depends on the show,
but there's all the different things.

166
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:47,291
There's Itunes,
then there's the raw mp3 that you can 

167
00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:47,300
download there,
stitcher,

168
00:06:47,301 --> 00:06:48,590
which is really hard to track.

169
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:50,000
Yeah.
You don't know what's going on.

170
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:52,340
Stitcher only takes one.
They'll give you numbers,

171
00:06:52,341 --> 00:06:57,341
but you know,
chase it down to what they do is 

172
00:06:57,341 --> 00:06:59,810
stitcher is an application for cell 
phones that allows,

173
00:06:59,811 --> 00:07:04,811
they take a podcast and they below are 
the bit rate and make it a much smaller 

174
00:07:04,811 --> 00:07:07,490
file and then they,
so they only download one episode,

175
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:11,000
but then it gets distributed through 
their system,

176
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:12,740
you know,
I don't know how many times.

177
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:15,590
So then there's that.
Then there's Ustream,

178
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:18,650
which is a few thousand usually.
Um,

179
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:23,680
and then there's youtube,
which is tens if not hundreds of 

180
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:23,990
thousands,
usually hundreds of thousands.

181
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:25,880
And then,
um,

182
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:27,990
it's never tens of thousands.
Um,

183
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,350
and then,
um,

184
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:35,380
vimeo.
So altogether it's usually around a 

185
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:36,560
billion an episode depending on the 
episode.

186
00:07:36,561 --> 00:07:37,340
Crazy.
Yeah.

187
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:39,190
It could be more crazy numbers,
you know,

188
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,390
powerful jewelry.
Well,

189
00:07:41,391 --> 00:07:42,650
it's just a number thing.

190
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:47,530
Just you keep doing it.
Have interesting people like rich roll.

191
00:07:47,531 --> 00:07:48,290
It isn't,
gentlemen,

192
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:51,230
have interesting people on have funny 
conversations,

193
00:07:51,231 --> 00:07:54,050
fun conversations,
and just keep doing it and it built.

194
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:59,530
I just listened to your episode with Sam
Harris from the other day and it's just 

195
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,160
he.
That guy is captivating.

196
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:02,810
Yeah.
He's an interesting dude.

197
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,880
He's a very intelligent,
very cool guy.

198
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:06,700
I want to get him together with Abby 
Martin though.

199
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:09,620
I.
She's got down the same room.

200
00:08:09,621 --> 00:08:12,710
I'm sure your phone rang from her after 
that show.

201
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,500
I got a few text messages.
We went back and forth.

202
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:20,560
She's my friend.
I'm very good friends with her and I'm 

203
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:20,560
good friends with Sam too.
I like both of them.

204
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,890
Well,
Sam's got a next level brain.

205
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:22,940
Yeah.
He's very smart.

206
00:08:22,941 --> 00:08:27,941
Whether you agree with him or not,
he has an incredible acuity to present 

207
00:08:28,101 --> 00:08:33,101
an argument and support it and 
communicate it in a very clear and calm 

208
00:08:33,101 --> 00:08:33,470
way.

209
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:35,630
He's also very honest,
you know,

210
00:08:35,631 --> 00:08:36,000
like,
uh,

211
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,680
if he's communicating and argument he is
not doing it to be deceptive.

212
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:45,010
These are his actual feelings and 
thoughts and agree with them or not 

213
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:45,620
agreeing with them.
This is his point of view and uh,

214
00:08:45,621 --> 00:08:46,430
as,
as hard as,

215
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:47,060
you know,
I mean,

216
00:08:47,061 --> 00:08:48,910
I respect both of them very much.
I,

217
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:51,740
I,
I'm in the middle between both as well.

218
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,050
I'm not necessarily 100 percent her 
side.

219
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,250
I'm not necessarily hundred percent his 
side.

220
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:57,830
Um,
it's,

221
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:58,710
it's,
it's,

222
00:08:58,711 --> 00:08:59,670
uh,
you know,

223
00:08:59,671 --> 00:09:02,550
you're talking about death and war and 
uh,

224
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:06,600
anytime you can find any way to minimize
or trivialize that,

225
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:10,470
it's easily open for argument,
open for criticism.

226
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,320
So that's where I see,
I see her point of view,

227
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:18,350
but I also see his point of view.
It's a lot of fucking crazy people in 

228
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:18,350
the world.
What a awful,

229
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:18,350
terrible people.

230
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:23,150
There's a lot of really dangerous 
ideologies that are being passed around 

231
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:24,210
and have been passed around for a long 
time.

232
00:09:24,211 --> 00:09:28,590
And the people that are embedded in 
these ideologies are married to them.

233
00:09:28,591 --> 00:09:29,890
They're very,
very committed to it.

234
00:09:29,891 --> 00:09:31,440
And you know,
I see his point of view.

235
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:33,600
He knows what he's talking about and to 
shade.

236
00:09:33,601 --> 00:09:35,160
So it's,
it's crazy,

237
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:36,210
you know.
Well,

238
00:09:36,211 --> 00:09:37,290
a couple things.
I mean,

239
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:42,710
first of all,
I'm always impressed with how you kind 

240
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:44,901
of navigate the treacherous waters of 
having guests on that you may disagree 

241
00:09:44,901 --> 00:09:45,720
with,
which may beat me today,

242
00:09:45,721 --> 00:09:47,070
I don't know,
but you know,

243
00:09:47,071 --> 00:09:52,071
sort of yell,
you'll have people with different point 

244
00:09:52,071 --> 00:09:52,071
of view,
sometimes extreme,

245
00:09:52,071 --> 00:09:52,071
sometimes not,
uh,

246
00:09:52,071 --> 00:09:56,861
and,
and the way that you kind of have to 

247
00:09:56,861 --> 00:09:56,861
gracefully like as a podcast.
So it's myself,

248
00:09:56,861 --> 00:09:56,970
that's always a challenge,
you know,

249
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:58,660
like how do you,
um,

250
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:01,320
have a respectful,
engaging conversation,

251
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:06,360
um,
but also make sure that you're asking 

252
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:06,930
the right questions so that you're not 
just people pleasing.

253
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,600
Well,
I don't think there's anything wrong 

254
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:12,600
with disagreeing with someone,
you know,

255
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,190
and I don't think there's anything wrong
with having a pleasant conversation with

256
00:10:14,191 --> 00:10:19,191
someone whose views you don't share.
I think two people can be diametrically 

257
00:10:19,191 --> 00:10:22,140
opposed on certain issues,
but still be nice to each other.

258
00:10:22,141 --> 00:10:23,400
I don't think there's anything wrong 
with that.

259
00:10:23,401 --> 00:10:28,401
And I think when I talked to someone who
doesn't share my opinions or has 

260
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:33,740
differing opinions,
I tried to relax whatever part of me 

261
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:37,650
wants to argue with that and just try to
figure out what is it,

262
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:39,170
where they come in from,
you know,

263
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:44,250
where's,
what's their point of view based on is 

264
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:44,250
it logical,
is it emotional,

265
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:46,270
is it objective,
is it non,

266
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:48,510
where,
where were they at,

267
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:51,240
you know?
And also I like to play,

268
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:53,400
like sometimes people say you have a,
you asked this,

269
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:58,600
that.
And sometimes I'll ask people things 

270
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,070
that I don't even,
I don't even believe what I'm saying,

271
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:04,100
what I'm,
what I'm trying to do is either play 

272
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:06,531
devil's advocate or argue the 
counterpoint just to try to figure out 

273
00:11:06,531 --> 00:11:09,300
where they're at and try to cover all 
the bases.

274
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,580
Because especially when it comes to a 
controversial issue,

275
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:12,810
you know,
you want,

276
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:16,650
you want to explore not just where a 
person's at,

277
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,420
like what,
what they're trying to say,

278
00:11:18,421 --> 00:11:20,760
but how did they come to that 
conclusion?

279
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:23,070
Right.
And in the case of Sam,

280
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,960
I mean,
he's traveled extensively.

281
00:11:24,961 --> 00:11:27,510
He has firsthand experience with all 
these kinds of people.

282
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:30,900
Um,
so he has a basis from where,

283
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:32,580
you know,
for where he's coming from.

284
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:35,640
A,
I was actually a funny story about him.

285
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,290
I've never met him,
I don't know him,

286
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:42,350
but we were classmates.
We were in the same freshman class in 

287
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:45,020
college at Stanford and uh,
and I don't,

288
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:50,060
like I said I don't know him,
but we have mutual friends in common so 

289
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:53,661
a couple of guys that I'm close with 
that he's still close with and I was 

290
00:11:53,661 --> 00:11:56,931
talking to one of them recently and you 
just said we were talking about Sam 

291
00:11:56,931 --> 00:12:00,091
because he's blown up and he's 
everywhere and he's so insight guy 

292
00:12:00,091 --> 00:12:00,091
straighten out.

293
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,370
And uh,
he was telling me that in some freshmen,

294
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:05,980
I don't know if it was a freshman 
English class or something like that,

295
00:12:05,981 --> 00:12:07,450
that,
that he,

296
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:10,600
that Sam just distinguished himself 
immediately,

297
00:12:10,601 --> 00:12:15,601
like by challenging the professor and 
just everybody knew that he was on a 

298
00:12:15,601 --> 00:12:19,090
nother level intellectually at a,
at a young age.

299
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:24,510
Well,
it's got to be very difficult if you're 

300
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:26,881
in college and you're taking classes 
from a person that you think is a dumb 

301
00:12:26,881 --> 00:12:27,460
ass,
which does happen.

302
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:28,600
Right,
right.

303
00:12:28,601 --> 00:12:31,540
I mean,
I had it happen in college.

304
00:12:31,541 --> 00:12:35,650
I can clearly remember.
I forgot what class it was in,

305
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:37,610
but I can clearly remember going,
oh,

306
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:42,750
all right,
well now I have to just think only of 

307
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:42,750
the information,
the,

308
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:46,480
the actual numbers and the data that's 
being presented in this class and ignore

309
00:12:46,481 --> 00:12:49,060
this person's opinion because there are 
a fucking idiot.

310
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:54,270
It was,
I believe it was either a philosophy 

311
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:54,270
class or a psychology class.

312
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:56,990
I don't remember the exact circumstance,
but I remember thinking like,

313
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,120
Oh,
this is a real issue.

314
00:12:58,390 --> 00:13:03,390
And then as I got older and I started 
paying attention to some of the things 

315
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:06,880
that get taught in school and some of 
the like very rigid ideologies.

316
00:13:06,881 --> 00:13:11,740
It's some people especially like really 
super lefties like to impose on students

317
00:13:11,741 --> 00:13:14,040
and some of the ideas they tried to 
impose on students are very.

318
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:16,060
It's a very subjective ideas.
You know,

319
00:13:16,061 --> 00:13:18,310
very,
very much personal opinions.

320
00:13:18,311 --> 00:13:23,311
They get stuffed into kids' heads and 
then it becomes an issue of whether or 

321
00:13:23,621 --> 00:13:26,560
not you know whether or not you want 
that in your head.

322
00:13:26,561 --> 00:13:27,440
Whether or not.
I mean,

323
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:30,880
you're going to get an a in this class 
if you disagree with this guy,

324
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:36,000
but still present good arguments or 
you're going to have to go along with 

325
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,451
the way this person is trying to portray
the world in order to be graded 

326
00:13:39,451 --> 00:13:39,451
accordingly.

327
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:44,940
I don't think critical thought is really
taught to the extent that it should be 

328
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,020
in young people.
You know,

329
00:13:47,021 --> 00:13:49,720
we're on this.
Our education system is about,

330
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:54,780
you know,
getting through as much information as 

331
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:54,780
possible and standardized testing and 
you know,

332
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:57,660
getting good grades and all that kind of
thing and you know,

333
00:13:57,830 --> 00:14:02,830
the idea that you should be questioning 
the ideas that are presented to you is 

334
00:14:02,921 --> 00:14:07,921
really not something that is part of 
that world to the extent that I think it

335
00:14:08,081 --> 00:14:09,300
should be.
I agree.

336
00:14:09,301 --> 00:14:12,880
And I also think that there's very 
little being taught,

337
00:14:12,881 --> 00:14:17,881
especially at a high school level of how
to think and not just like,

338
00:14:18,311 --> 00:14:21,220
this is mathematics,
this is the way you calculate things.

339
00:14:21,221 --> 00:14:26,221
This is,
these are the facts of history that 

340
00:14:26,221 --> 00:14:28,261
we're aware of instead of how do you 
deal with problems,

341
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:33,820
how do you address interpersonal 
relationships?

342
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:37,820
How do you,
how do you look at yourself objectives?

343
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:43,050
Do you ever step back and try to look at
yourself the way maybe someone else 

344
00:14:43,721 --> 00:14:48,721
would and judge yourself and your own 
actions instead of protecting yourself 

345
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:53,311
with your ego and all those things that 
people do like almost naturally to 

346
00:14:53,311 --> 00:14:55,040
protect themselves,
really wind up being traps.

347
00:14:55,330 --> 00:15:00,330
It really wind up fucking you up and you
have to kind of clean up that mess as 

348
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:00,500
you get older.
Well,

349
00:15:00,501 --> 00:15:05,501
I mean,
I guess that's supposed to be on the 

350
00:15:05,501 --> 00:15:05,660
parents.
You know what I mean?

351
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:10,900
They don't do it either like life 
skills.

352
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:12,710
What about just,
you know,

353
00:15:12,711 --> 00:15:15,080
learning how to navigate this crazy 
world that we're living in,

354
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:16,700
you know,
about learning how to eat.

355
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,590
For me,
the most important thing,

356
00:15:18,591 --> 00:15:19,700
you know,
as a parents,

357
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:24,750
it's like I want my kids to be excited 
about life and to be excited about 

358
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:29,381
something,
to figure out a way to be passionate 

359
00:15:29,381 --> 00:15:29,381
about something because if they have 
that motor,

360
00:15:29,381 --> 00:15:32,420
that drive,
that is half the game right there.

361
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:36,230
And then also to have that ability to 
critically,

362
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:41,260
you know,
to want to learn the desire to learn as 

363
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:41,260
much more important than whatever you're
learning.

364
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:44,000
Yeah.
So how do you make your kid enthusiastic

365
00:15:44,001 --> 00:15:49,001
about that?
Especially when they're getting beaten 

366
00:15:49,001 --> 00:15:51,221
down,
you've got to find whatever it is that 

367
00:15:51,221 --> 00:15:51,221
they're drawn to.
Right?

368
00:15:51,221 --> 00:15:55,540
Yeah.
So you expose them to a lot of things 

369
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:58,031
and then when they find something that 
they kind of gravitate towards your job 

370
00:15:58,031 --> 00:15:58,310
is to support that.
At least that's how I see it.

371
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:03,550
Yeah.
And then give them the opportunity to 

372
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:06,101
switch gears to.
I remember when I was a kid I would be 

373
00:16:06,101 --> 00:16:09,491
into a lot of different things and my 
parents would always be like super 

374
00:16:09,491 --> 00:16:09,980
resistant.
If I got into something else,

375
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:12,110
they'd be like,
well what about the other thing that you

376
00:16:12,111 --> 00:16:12,880
do?
When I'm like,

377
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:14,150
well I want to do this now.

378
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:16,220
Stop fucking with me.
What were you into?

379
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:20,450
Well,
initially I was really into art.

380
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:23,390
You're crazy drawer.
That's what I used to do.

381
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:24,890
Yeah,
all the all day long.

382
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:26,540
When I was really young,
I was A.

383
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:31,580
I wanted to be a comic book illustrator,
so I used to draw a lot and then um,

384
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:35,690
when I was in my teenage years I 
discovered martial arts and that's all I

385
00:16:35,691 --> 00:16:37,460
wanted to do.
And my parents were like,

386
00:16:37,461 --> 00:16:38,720
why do you want to do that?
Like,

387
00:16:38,721 --> 00:16:40,430
why are you doing that when you used to 
do this?

388
00:16:40,431 --> 00:16:42,600
I'm like,
because that's what I liked.

389
00:16:42,601 --> 00:16:44,120
Now can,
I just liked it.

390
00:16:44,121 --> 00:16:49,121
And they said that presupposes that you 
have to make a choice between two 

391
00:16:49,121 --> 00:16:52,361
things.
Like why do you have to define yourself 

392
00:16:52,361 --> 00:16:52,361
by one of those?
Well,

393
00:16:52,361 --> 00:16:53,090
why couldn't you be my dad?
What happened?

394
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:55,820
Where were you when my mom was hot?

395
00:16:57,410 --> 00:16:59,180
Yeah,
I think there's,

396
00:16:59,181 --> 00:17:00,560
um,
you know,

397
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:03,410
it's,
a lot of it is people,

398
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:05,170
you know,
they're raising their kids,

399
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:10,190
they just want the best for their kids.
They just maybe don't have the best 

400
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:10,700
ideas,
you know,

401
00:17:10,701 --> 00:17:13,360
they don't necessarily know.
And it's also like,

402
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:16,820
I mean,
I was born in 1967,

403
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:19,310
so my parents were basically cave 
people.

404
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:21,050
I mean,
let's be realistic,

405
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:23,150
like people that were,
if you're,

406
00:17:23,151 --> 00:17:25,580
if you're born in [inaudible] 67,
that means your parents were.

407
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:29,620
My parents were born in [inaudible] 47,
right?

408
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:33,500
My mom was like 20 when she had me.
So w 1947.

409
00:17:33,501 --> 00:17:35,000
That's fucking world war two.
Dude,

410
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:38,690
that means that her parents were born 
during World War One.

411
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:43,990
My,
her parents came over on the boat from 

412
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:43,990
Italy.
It's,

413
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:45,710
they're savages.
They're basically,

414
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:47,910
they might as well be Magellan,
right?

415
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:49,410
Well there too.
I mean,

416
00:17:49,411 --> 00:17:50,700
I was born in [inaudible] 66,

417
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:53,070
so same,
same basic idea.

418
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,650
My parents,
you know,

419
00:17:54,651 --> 00:17:59,651
they're,
they're too old to have been part of 

420
00:17:59,651 --> 00:17:59,651
kind of sixties subculture.
Um,

421
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:04,820
so they kind of missed that part but too
young to kind of be seventies vibe also.

422
00:18:06,631 --> 00:18:10,680
So there's sort of a weird like light 
dusting of mad men era,

423
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:13,500
you know,
and they're great people.

424
00:18:13,501 --> 00:18:14,700
I love my parents,
you know,

425
00:18:14,701 --> 00:18:15,270
their,
their,

426
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:20,360
their fans and they did the best job 
that they could raising me and work 

427
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:20,360
clothes and all that kind of stuff.
But,

428
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:21,870
but they live,
you know,

429
00:18:21,871 --> 00:18:23,280
they don't understand.
They have a,

430
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:26,820
they have a challenge trying to 
understand like what I'm doing now.

431
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:27,930
Really.
They try.

432
00:18:27,931 --> 00:18:28,530
Yeah.
Like,

433
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:30,480
and they're happy that I'm,
that I'm happy,

434
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:31,800
but it's very,
you know,

435
00:18:31,801 --> 00:18:34,440
they're coming from a generation where,
you know,

436
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:39,980
look,
I grew up in a really education focused 

437
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:42,381
household and I tried to my best to live
up to that and to some extent I 

438
00:18:42,381 --> 00:18:42,381
succeeded at that.

439
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,410
But the whole idea was premised on this 
myth of the American dream,

440
00:18:46,411 --> 00:18:47,370
you know,
study hard,

441
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:51,300
get into the best school,
get into the best graduate school,

442
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:52,770
get the best job you can,
you know,

443
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:57,860
work hard and like do as you're told and
ascend the ladder and the implicit 

444
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:58,500
promise,
you know,

445
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,870
at the end of that rainbow of course is 
not only,

446
00:19:00,871 --> 00:19:05,871
you know,
sort of security and prosperity but 

447
00:19:05,871 --> 00:19:05,871
happiness.
Yeah.

448
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:11,300
And for me,
I chased that without ever really 

449
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:13,910
without those critical thinking skills 
because I never really intuited that I 

450
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:18,261
was just so focused on the prize and I'm
very disciplined and determined and but 

451
00:19:19,231 --> 00:19:24,231
I wasn't able to step outside the box 
and look at it analytically in 

452
00:19:24,231 --> 00:19:25,050
comparison to,
you know,

453
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:27,360
what would be best for me.
Like I never said,

454
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:28,590
what do I want?
It was just,

455
00:19:28,591 --> 00:19:30,750
this is what you do,
this is how you get ahead.

456
00:19:30,751 --> 00:19:32,160
This is how you have a good life.

457
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:34,920
I think there's also their fault.
Sure.

458
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:36,320
No,
it's definitely not their fault.

459
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:41,350
The amount of information that they had 
available to them back then comparison 

460
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:43,740
to what we have today is unbelievably 
different now.

461
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:48,960
There's so much more information now and
I think there's also a very.

462
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:54,980
There's a real lack of understanding of 
the landscape of the race you're in.

463
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:58,380
Like everybody wants to think of it as a
race is the rat race.

464
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:03,770
But if you look,
if you could get an aerial view of the 

465
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:06,741
actual race from birth to death,
from the time you're born to the time 

466
00:20:06,741 --> 00:20:10,911
you leave this planet.
And look at it as like you're looking 

467
00:20:10,911 --> 00:20:12,090
into formula one race track and you 
could actually see the course.

468
00:20:12,091 --> 00:20:14,010
You'd be like,
Oh fucking Jesus Christ.

469
00:20:14,011 --> 00:20:16,470
What am I doing here?
I'm wasting all my time doing shit.

470
00:20:16,471 --> 00:20:18,780
I don't want to do this.
Race is not very long.

471
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:21,900
This race is going to end like this is a
fuck.

472
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:27,020
I thought it.
I thought there was like a happiness 

473
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:28,851
truck somewhere along the line that I 
was going to refuel with and change my 

474
00:20:28,851 --> 00:20:29,430
tires when I get my phd.

475
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:34,490
It's the idea that you're going to 
arrive at some point or that you're 

476
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:36,450
going to land in this destination that 
is called success or happiness.

477
00:20:36,451 --> 00:20:39,450
And when you get to our age,
you realize that that's just.

478
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:40,920
That's an illusion,
right?

479
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:45,980
It just continues.
And you start to think about what your 

480
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:49,041
life means.
What do you stand for and what is your 

481
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:49,041
legacy?
You know,

482
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:49,270
we're approaching 50.
It's like,

483
00:20:49,271 --> 00:20:52,240
what do you know if I die today,
what was,

484
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:54,670
what did I,
what did I leave in my wake?

485
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:55,530
Well,
even that,

486
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:58,420
look,
the bottom line is whatever you leave,

487
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:03,780
it's not gonna matter because it's going
to matter to some people that you know 

488
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:05,080
and they're going to leave to.
Everyone's going to leave,

489
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:08,640
but are you enjoying this?
Are you enjoying the moment?

490
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:12,820
Everyone's working towards this ultimate
like the retirement years,

491
00:21:12,821 --> 00:21:17,821
the golden ears like you're fucking 
almost dead when those years come like 

492
00:21:17,821 --> 00:21:20,200
those little you see those people 
holding hands and walking along,

493
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:22,210
they barely can walk.
Their knees hurt.

494
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:25,240
They're all fucked up like that's not 
what you work for.

495
00:21:25,241 --> 00:21:30,241
You don't work towards this ultimate 
point where you don't do anything 

496
00:21:30,241 --> 00:21:33,751
anymore and that's ridiculous.
The what you should work towards is 

497
00:21:33,751 --> 00:21:37,270
doing what you enjoy doing right now and
enjoying your life right now,

498
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:42,330
enjoying your friends right now,
enjoying whatever hobbies you like to 

499
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:46,021
pursue.
Whatever love affairs and friendships 

500
00:21:46,021 --> 00:21:47,950
and all that stuff is what life is.

501
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:52,510
Life is the moment being in the moment 
and we somehow have turned it into this,

502
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:58,360
this weird journey to have a very 
specific point,

503
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:01,360
specific points of high school 
graduation,

504
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:04,540
college graduation,
but good job marriage,

505
00:22:04,541 --> 00:22:09,541
children,
we have all these like milestones that 

506
00:22:09,541 --> 00:22:12,160
are supposed to impart happiness in this
race and they they're not real.

507
00:22:12,161 --> 00:22:17,161
They're social constructs and we've.
We've created these social constructs 

508
00:22:17,161 --> 00:22:20,491
and we've fed into them and pass them 
down from generation to generation 

509
00:22:20,491 --> 00:22:22,300
without anybody stepping back and going,
well,

510
00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:25,240
who set this up?
Who set up?

511
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:27,450
Who set up graduate school?
Who said it?

512
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:29,860
Who set up?
Who set up common core?

513
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:31,600
Who?
Who are these people like,

514
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:32,470
why?
Why is,

515
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:37,740
why is it this way with this?
We're just biological organisms trying 

516
00:22:38,171 --> 00:22:42,160
to have as much happiness and good 
feeling while we're here is we can.

517
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,270
I feel like that's

518
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:48,270
changing though.
I think that if you talk to somebody 

519
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:51,241
who's in their twenties,
you know the idea that you would work a 

520
00:22:51,241 --> 00:22:53,770
corporate job and stay in that job for 
your career and collect your pension and

521
00:22:53,771 --> 00:22:58,771
then write out your sixties and 
seventies playing golf is a foreign 

522
00:22:58,771 --> 00:23:01,360
concept to a young person.
Whereas that was the kind of paradigm,

523
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:04,240
right?
For our parents' generation and when you

524
00:23:04,241 --> 00:23:09,241
look at the advent of the Internet and 
what that provides and allows you see 

525
00:23:09,241 --> 00:23:13,231
this explosion in lifestyle careers 
where you're not wed to a geographic 

526
00:23:13,391 --> 00:23:18,391
location.
We live in a kind of subcontractor 

527
00:23:18,391 --> 00:23:20,620
economy where people are more project 
based than,

528
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:25,680
than you know,
working for the big corporation or the 

529
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:28,201
plants and certainly all that stuff 
exists on some level but not to the 

530
00:23:28,201 --> 00:23:28,900
extent that it,
that it used to.

531
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:34,000
And I think that's super interesting and
I think that allows people to engage in 

532
00:23:34,691 --> 00:23:36,820
critical thinking and a new and 
different way.

533
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:41,820
And I think you see young people who are
asking themselves those very questions 

534
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:41,820
like,
what do I want to do?

535
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:44,620
What makes me happy with that can come 
entitlement.

536
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:48,110
And that's why I think the millennials 
get a get a bad rap for that,

537
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:53,470
but at the same time I think that they 
are much more engaged in trying to 

538
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:56,750
grapple with who they are and what it is
that,

539
00:23:56,780 --> 00:24:01,780
you know,
they're passionate about expressing and 

540
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:03,701
then finding a way to tap into the 
economy somehow so that they can 

541
00:24:03,701 --> 00:24:08,410
contribute and make a living doing that.
And I think that that's really cool to 

542
00:24:08,410 --> 00:24:08,410
watch unfold.

543
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:13,480
I agree.
And I think that the idea that 

544
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,641
millennials are entitled,
I think every young kid has a distorted 

545
00:24:17,631 --> 00:24:20,390
perception of the world that we live in 
and in every generation,

546
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:22,000
probably less so to know they're going 
to,

547
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,740
they're going to be in some,
probably not on a podcast,

548
00:24:24,741 --> 00:24:26,240
but in some form of media,
you know,

549
00:24:26,241 --> 00:24:28,400
20 years from now talking about how,
you know,

550
00:24:28,401 --> 00:24:33,401
you and I are out to lunch.
I mean that's the natural order of 

551
00:24:33,401 --> 00:24:37,601
things,
but how are priorities and how we raise 

552
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:37,601
them,
who is myopic in some way.

553
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,080
Sure.
I'm sure.

554
00:24:39,081 --> 00:24:39,690
Yeah,
they'll fill,

555
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:44,860
they'll figure it out.
They'll get it better than we're doing 

556
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:44,860
it well with the acceleration of 
technology.

557
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:45,290
I mean,
who knows where things are going to be.

558
00:24:45,291 --> 00:24:48,500
We just can't foresee what the,
what that world would look like.

559
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:53,590
Yeah.
Human beings might be obsolete in 20 

560
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:55,841
years.
Did you listen to the last hour of the 

561
00:24:55,841 --> 00:24:55,841
Sam Harris' podcast?
Artificial intelligence?

562
00:24:55,841 --> 00:24:57,190
No.
I got into the first.

563
00:24:57,250 --> 00:25:02,250
I think I.
I didn't make it through the end of it 

564
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:04,860
the last hour and keeps me up at night.
Did you see there's a movie called x 

565
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:06,530
mock and I'm going to see it tonight.
So interesting.

566
00:25:06,531 --> 00:25:08,210
Half in.
It's,

567
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,910
it's,
it's haunting.

568
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:13,090
It's very well done.
It's a very small,

569
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:18,750
very contained independent movie,
but it's so well executed and you just 

570
00:25:18,941 --> 00:25:21,910
leave like with a lot to think about.

571
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:23,600
There's a lot to think about,
period.

572
00:25:23,601 --> 00:25:28,601
You know,
I had a long sit down with Ray Kurzweil 

573
00:25:28,601 --> 00:25:31,750
and I interviewed him for the Scifi show
that I did and we went back and forth 

574
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:35,891
over the possibilities of this new era 
that we're entering into.

575
00:25:36,711 --> 00:25:37,700
We were,
we went to,

576
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,650
excuse me,
this global 20,

577
00:25:39,651 --> 00:25:41,470
45 initiative.
Yeah.

578
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:45,590
That they were having a New York City 
where all the futurists got together and

579
00:25:45,591 --> 00:25:50,591
they were all comparing notes and 
talking about the different 

580
00:25:50,591 --> 00:25:51,860
possibilities for not just artificial 
intelligence,

581
00:25:51,861 --> 00:25:54,620
but symbiotic relationships with 
computers,

582
00:25:54,621 --> 00:25:58,130
downloading consciousness into databases
and all this kind of crazy shit.

583
00:25:58,430 --> 00:26:01,160
And you walk away thinking like,
I don't,

584
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:06,550
I don't know if anybody knows where this
is going and it's not going to stop.

585
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:12,440
There's going to be continual innovation
until we reach some,

586
00:26:13,010 --> 00:26:16,250
some event,
horizon of science,

587
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:20,120
some,
some point of no return,

588
00:26:20,121 --> 00:26:25,121
you know,
some what they call ultimate novelty 

589
00:26:25,121 --> 00:26:25,121
point.
That's what Terence Mckenna used to call

590
00:26:25,121 --> 00:26:25,121
it.
You know,

591
00:26:25,121 --> 00:26:29,921
this ultimate novelty point and it's 
probably gonna happen within our 

592
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:34,001
lifetime.
It's probably going to have within the 

593
00:26:34,001 --> 00:26:35,621
next 20 or 30 years.
You think it's going to happen that 

594
00:26:35,621 --> 00:26:35,621
soon?
I mean,

595
00:26:35,621 --> 00:26:37,010
I'm just guessing it's all,
it's total guessing.

596
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:42,250
Well,
there's always the issue of natural 

597
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:43,601
disasters.
Any real natural disaster would throw a 

598
00:26:43,601 --> 00:26:44,400
massive hiccup into any plans

599
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,340
that anyone has.
I mean,

600
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:50,350
if all we'd need is yellowstone to blow 
and it would set back civilization to 

601
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:52,170
three generations easily,
if not forever.

602
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,970
Well,
how about just California running out of

603
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:58,980
water?
I think if we can get oil from Saudi 

604
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:04,280
Arabia,
how the fuck can we not get water from 

605
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:04,280
Antarctica that everybody's whining 
about those,

606
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:09,320
those ice caps melting,
just stick a fucking big pipe on those 

607
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,140
pitches and run them down to the almond 
fields?

608
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:10,980
Well,
you know what's weird,

609
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:12,470
what's weird is,
uh,

610
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:17,220
is how you would think,
like if you didn't know better,

611
00:27:17,221 --> 00:27:20,490
you would think how hard can it be to 
desalinate the ocean?

612
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:23,910
That's got to be elementary school 
chemistry,

613
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:29,030
right?
But it's interesting that it's so 

614
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:31,101
difficult that the best minds are having
such a hard time figuring that out and 

615
00:27:31,101 --> 00:27:35,241
it's almost like the universe has rigged
it that way because human beings are 

616
00:27:35,241 --> 00:27:39,321
such idiots that if they made it easy,
our oceans would be dry deserts right 

617
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:42,030
now because we can't help ourselves.

618
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:44,220
We cannot help ourselves.
And that is the same,

619
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:47,430
you know,
compulsion that is propelling technology

620
00:27:47,431 --> 00:27:52,431
forward and will ultimately catapult us 
into this ai universe that's going to 

621
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:53,900
destroy us.
I,

622
00:27:53,910 --> 00:27:55,710
yeah,
I think whatever it is,

623
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:00,630
why we find that funny is weird,
right?

624
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,280
I know,
but it is true.

625
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:06,630
If we could fucking dry out the ocean,
we would have done it a long time ago.

626
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:08,880
Those houses in Malibu who were dog 
shit.

627
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:14,690
It's about $20,000,000
houses and that's not really a 

628
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:14,690
$20,000,000
house.

629
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:16,620
It's just $20,000,000
because it's right there on the water.

630
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:22,130
Yeah.
That house would be worth fuck all 

631
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:24,960
because there would be like a few 
hundred yards of dirt in front of your 

632
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:28,161
house now.
I mean how hard can it be to separate 

633
00:28:28,161 --> 00:28:28,161
salt from water?
Apparently.

634
00:28:28,161 --> 00:28:28,260
It's pretty hard.
Yeah.

635
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:28,620
Well,
you know,

636
00:28:28,621 --> 00:28:32,190
they just opened up a large,
a desalination plant in San Diego.

637
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:34,440
I heard about that.
It's been over a billion dollars in this

638
00:28:34,441 --> 00:28:35,850
fucker.
And then give it a run.

639
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:37,890
Right.
I just think it's a matter of time.

640
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:43,110
I mean they,
it's absolutely possible to take salt 

641
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:45,981
out of water.
So I don't think that there's been as 

642
00:28:45,981 --> 00:28:49,161
much incentive in the past as there is 
now and now that California has gone on 

643
00:28:49,161 --> 00:28:54,081
this three year drought where we need 11
trillion gallons of water just to bring 

644
00:28:54,631 --> 00:28:57,450
us back to normal.
Wow.

645
00:28:58,260 --> 00:28:59,040
Well,
it's,

646
00:28:59,330 --> 00:29:04,330
it's kind of emblematic of how we deal 
with problems because instead of trying 

647
00:29:04,981 --> 00:29:07,440
to solve the problem that got us to this
place,

648
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:10,020
we're just looking for another source of
water,

649
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:11,790
right?
It's sort of like taking,

650
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:16,260
you know,
taking Viagra to deal with the fact that

651
00:29:16,261 --> 00:29:19,590
you can't get a boner instead of looking
at why it is you can't get a boner.

652
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:21,060
Right?
But I mean like you're,

653
00:29:21,061 --> 00:29:22,590
you're,
you're dealing with the symptom.

654
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:25,620
But there are deserts that didn't use to
be deserts.

655
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:30,940
I mean they're not because of humankind,
because that's because of natural 

656
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:30,940
forces,
right?

657
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:35,660
So there is certainly one aspect of this
that you can kind of point towards human

658
00:29:36,301 --> 00:29:39,390
beings,
but the reality of the earth,

659
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:41,560
the absolute reality of the earth is

660
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:44,680
climates change,
oceans,

661
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:46,330
law,
the levels change.

662
00:29:46,331 --> 00:29:49,540
They always have an.
Even if people didn't exist,

663
00:29:50,410 --> 00:29:54,120
you would have to deal with that.
So is there any sound like a climate,

664
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:58,270
but I'm definitely not.
All I'm saying is we have this idea that

665
00:29:58,271 --> 00:30:00,910
once we're in a spot we should be able 
to stay in this spot,

666
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,940
this spot,
but there are spots in North America.

667
00:30:03,941 --> 00:30:08,941
First of all,
like half of North America was covered 

668
00:30:08,941 --> 00:30:08,941
in a mile of ice just 10,000
years ago.

669
00:30:08,941 --> 00:30:13,920
That's a fact and we have to deal with 
the fact that if we want to like set up 

670
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:17,200
a house and have.
We only have five acres right here,

671
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:20,920
well guess what?
In 20 years for whatever reason,

672
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:25,950
that might not be a good spot anymore 
and we have this idea that once we own 

673
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:28,660
property that that spot should be 
livable and ideal forever.

674
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:32,620
And even if people didn't have anything 
to do with the climate,

675
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,540
the climate will shift,
change.

676
00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:36,280
Things change.
They always will change.

677
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:41,460
We just have this really rigid idea of 
like where we should be able to put 

678
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:41,460
cities.
I mean,

679
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:44,650
when they keep finding these cities from
like several thousand years ago,

680
00:30:44,651 --> 00:30:49,651
like did she ever see those concentric 
circles that they found in the water 

681
00:30:49,651 --> 00:30:52,621
that they believe represents something 
very similar to what Atlanta was 

682
00:30:52,621 --> 00:30:54,570
described as Spain outside of Spain,
they've,

683
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:59,600
they've found many,
many underground cities where at some 

684
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:04,411
point in time the sea level change and 
it was long before carbon emissions,

685
00:31:04,421 --> 00:31:08,560
long before people were burning fossil 
fuels and using machines.

686
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:14,000
It's just things shift.
It's not to exonerate large 

687
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:14,440
corporations.
Cole,

688
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:17,890
our dependence on fossil fuel.
That's a totally separate argument.

689
00:31:17,891 --> 00:31:20,770
I,
I absolutely think all you have to do is

690
00:31:20,771 --> 00:31:23,080
look at La from a fucking airplane or 
worse.

691
00:31:23,690 --> 00:31:25,990
I got photos of Mexico City.
Holy Shit.

692
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:28,600
I was in Mexico City a couple months 
ago.

693
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,870
We go to Mexico City in June.
Again for the UFC,

694
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,340
by the way,
nicest people.

695
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:34,510
Very,
very friendly.

696
00:31:34,511 --> 00:31:38,290
Like you have this idea of Mexico City 
has been like horrible crime ridden,

697
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:39,700
awful place.
It's not.

698
00:31:39,701 --> 00:31:42,730
They're really nice people,
but they just need better roads.

699
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:45,070
God,
they're fucking pollution is insane.

700
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:50,370
You can taste it with your face,
like when you get out of the airplane 

701
00:31:50,370 --> 00:31:50,370
and you're like,
whoa,

702
00:31:50,370 --> 00:31:55,141
this is crazy.
And apparently it's better than it used 

703
00:31:55,141 --> 00:31:55,141
to be,
whether

704
00:31:55,141 --> 00:31:55,470
it's Mexico City or la,
you,

705
00:31:55,480 --> 00:32:00,480
you,
you get this really kind of potent 

706
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:03,380
sense.
You see the lights and the grid and you 

707
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:06,801
realize in the cars driving on the 
freeway and you realize it's just an 

708
00:32:06,801 --> 00:32:06,801
organism.
You know,

709
00:32:06,801 --> 00:32:09,960
there's these,
these freeways are carrying cars are the

710
00:32:09,961 --> 00:32:14,961
arteries and the cars of the blood cells
and we're feeding these cities like 

711
00:32:14,961 --> 00:32:19,400
their organs in this larger unit that is
interdependent.

712
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,380
And it's interesting and I think it,
it,

713
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:25,980
you know,
what you said about this idea of,

714
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:30,930
of human beings and this idea that,
that we think everything is static.

715
00:32:30,931 --> 00:32:32,640
I mean,
I think that applies across the board.

716
00:32:32,641 --> 00:32:34,440
Like we think these cities will always 
be there,

717
00:32:34,441 --> 00:32:39,441
but we also think that our lives are,
are somewhat static or that our 

718
00:32:39,441 --> 00:32:40,040
relationships are static or our jobs or 
static or

719
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,870
our bank accounts.
All of these things.

720
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:42,950
Um,
you know,

721
00:32:42,951 --> 00:32:45,500
we kind of agreed to in this social 
contract,

722
00:32:45,501 --> 00:32:47,030
but everything's fluid.
Man.

723
00:32:47,170 --> 00:32:50,630
You know,
everything is fluid and changing all the

724
00:32:50,631 --> 00:32:55,631
time on the micro level that leads to 
the macro and it's always going to be 

725
00:32:55,971 --> 00:32:58,100
that way.
And the also have to realize,

726
00:32:58,101 --> 00:32:59,630
I think we have to realize that one of 
the.

727
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:03,020
I can't find these pictures of fucking.
I think he posted that.

728
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:05,360
I don't remember when you saw my 
instagram,

729
00:33:06,890 --> 00:33:11,890
but the point is that the only way a 
city got to be a city in the first place

730
00:33:11,991 --> 00:33:15,060
is things have changed radically.
If you looked at where that city is,

731
00:33:15,061 --> 00:33:18,080
he was the Los Angeles where it is 400 
years ago.

732
00:33:18,081 --> 00:33:19,670
There was absolutely nothing.
You know,

733
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:24,680
there's probably some native Americans 
and some Mexicans and some various 

734
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:28,541
people is back when it was Mexico and 
they were wandering around and doing 

735
00:33:28,541 --> 00:33:28,670
their thing,
but there was no.

736
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:33,410
There was no highways and sky rises and 
all that stuff was really,

737
00:33:33,411 --> 00:33:35,360
really recent.
And in terms of the,

738
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:38,270
the actual age of the earth,
my God,

739
00:33:38,271 --> 00:33:42,140
it's like blink your eye and then all of
a sudden cities are literally a blink of

740
00:33:42,141 --> 00:33:46,010
an eye and then everything's polluted.
Everything's fucked.

741
00:33:46,011 --> 00:33:49,280
And Malibu Beach Front property is 
ridiculously overpriced,

742
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,800
but in the history of this planet,
has there ever been more change?

743
00:33:54,801 --> 00:33:58,460
Planetary early with the exception of 
natural disasters then there has been in

744
00:33:58,461 --> 00:34:03,461
the last 200 years when that sense 
aren't human beings as a kind of a 

745
00:34:03,461 --> 00:34:04,940
natural where a virus on the planet.
I mean,

746
00:34:04,941 --> 00:34:06,150
come on.
That's called us.

747
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:10,060
He called caught a virus with shoes.
Yeah.

748
00:34:10,270 --> 00:34:11,240
It's interesting,
mom.

749
00:34:11,241 --> 00:34:15,380
The opening of my.
I'm a showtime special from like 2005.

750
00:34:15,381 --> 00:34:20,381
I argued that if you looked at the earth
as a living organism and you're flying 

751
00:34:20,421 --> 00:34:21,830
over and you saw la,
you'd go,

752
00:34:21,831 --> 00:34:22,610
well that's cancer.

753
00:34:22,610 --> 00:34:25,310
That's a growth.
It's growing.

754
00:34:25,610 --> 00:34:27,590
It's out of control.
It's stinks.

755
00:34:27,890 --> 00:34:30,890
It looks like it's a mess and it's 
getting bigger.

756
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:36,550
We're greedy.
Bastards were lacking that gene that 

757
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:39,470
prioritizes doing things sustainably.
I think it's a huge problem.

758
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:42,710
We're predatory.
We're not symbiotic well.

759
00:34:42,711 --> 00:34:47,270
I think we have an an inescapable thirst
for innovation.

760
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:51,230
We want new and better things and we 
want progress.

761
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:53,240
And of course short sighted in that 
regard.

762
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:54,020
We are,
we don't,

763
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:56,240
we,
we're unable to see the bigger picture.

764
00:34:56,640 --> 00:35:01,640
We don't have the foresight to,
to make the responsible decision quite 

765
00:35:01,971 --> 00:35:03,290
often,
quite often.

766
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:03,950
Well we,
we,

767
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:09,040
we err towards the size of prop started 
toward the side of profit and success 

768
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:14,480
and I oftentimes at the expense of,
what is that you think?

769
00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:18,440
I mean other animals,
other animals don't have that.

770
00:35:19,330 --> 00:35:24,330
Those,
even though they do though they do 

771
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:25,600
beavers fuck up dams and they create 
dams and ruined rivers.

772
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:29,180
They don't make beaver city says they 
can now they could,

773
00:35:29,181 --> 00:35:33,530
they would get together and you know,
if they can chew more huge giant dam and

774
00:35:33,531 --> 00:35:38,531
the Mississippi River,
if they can agree with each other and 

775
00:35:38,531 --> 00:35:38,580
they would do it,
they don't give a fuck about,

776
00:35:38,581 --> 00:35:40,740
you know what I mean?
Bears Shit.

777
00:35:40,741 --> 00:35:42,150
Wherever they walk,
they don't,

778
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:47,180
they don't clean up,
they don't have like a certain spot 

779
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:47,180
where they put all their shit.
They just don't have enough of an impact

780
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:49,260
to really change the environment around 
them.

781
00:35:49,261 --> 00:35:50,310
But if they could,
they would.

782
00:35:50,610 --> 00:35:55,610
Uh,
I was listening to a radio lab podcast 

783
00:35:55,610 --> 00:35:58,151
about the Galapagos Islands and it's 
very fascinating because they had to 

784
00:35:58,151 --> 00:36:02,250
eradicate goats because these sailors 
had brought goats over,

785
00:36:02,251 --> 00:36:05,460
you know,
way back in the day and they had brought

786
00:36:05,461 --> 00:36:09,600
goats and they put them on the island so
that they could come back and eat them,

787
00:36:09,601 --> 00:36:14,601
like they would have a food source,
but these goats just destroy everything 

788
00:36:14,601 --> 00:36:15,240
in their path.

789
00:36:15,570 --> 00:36:19,380
They just killed everything and they 
fucked it all up for the tortoise's.

790
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:24,680
These poor tortoise's we're fucked.
They didn't have any plant matter 

791
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:24,690
anymore because all these goats were 
coming along.

792
00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:27,720
So then they hired these people to kill 
the goats.

793
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:32,840
So they flew over and helicopters and 
they gunned down the goats and then God 

794
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:36,840
started getting smart.
So what they do was they would find 

795
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:36,840
goats.
They would capture them,

796
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:39,210
they would put radio collars on them,
they would scare them.

797
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:41,130
They would run over to where the other 
goats were,

798
00:36:41,131 --> 00:36:42,330
and then they would find where the goats
were.

799
00:36:42,331 --> 00:36:44,850
They would kill all of them except the 
ones with the radio collars.

800
00:36:45,330 --> 00:36:47,700
And so they became what they called 
Judas goats.

801
00:36:47,850 --> 00:36:52,050
It's really fascinating how they set 
this up and then it got to a point where

802
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:55,800
it was nothing but Judas goats.
That's all that was left.

803
00:36:56,190 --> 00:36:57,860
And so then,
you know,

804
00:36:57,970 --> 00:37:00,450
they tried to reintroduce tortoise's is 
really,

805
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:05,840
really fascinating.
But the argument could be made that any 

806
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:09,530
animal acting purely in its own interest
will ultimately fuck up everything 

807
00:37:09,530 --> 00:37:14,151
around it.
And it's one of the reasons why there's 

808
00:37:14,151 --> 00:37:16,281
gotta be some kind of a balance,
has got to be some kind of a balance 

809
00:37:16,281 --> 00:37:19,611
between humans and the plants that we 
coexist with and the animals that we 

810
00:37:20,101 --> 00:37:22,560
coexist with.
And the same can be said with animals,

811
00:37:22,770 --> 00:37:23,760
like,
you know,

812
00:37:23,770 --> 00:37:25,950
you can't have too many predators in an 
area.

813
00:37:25,951 --> 00:37:27,420
You can't have too many,
uh,

814
00:37:28,290 --> 00:37:31,080
too many deer in an area.
You're run into them with cars,

815
00:37:31,081 --> 00:37:34,740
they start starving to death.
You get ticks and people start spreading

816
00:37:34,830 --> 00:37:39,830
the.
They start spreading lyme disease and 

817
00:37:39,830 --> 00:37:41,370
there's like humans and animals and they
all act in their own interest.

818
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:44,210
It's just we're the only ones that have 
finger.

819
00:37:44,310 --> 00:37:49,310
Well,
we can manipulate shit and change the 

820
00:37:49,310 --> 00:37:49,680
environment in ways that no other animal
could even come close to.

821
00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:52,270
There is an infinitely complex,
you know,

822
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:57,320
play that's going on and we insert 
ourselves into that and we have this 

823
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,440
reductionist idea,
oh,

824
00:37:58,441 --> 00:38:03,441
if we insert this one thing,
then that will fix the problem and what 

825
00:38:03,441 --> 00:38:05,240
we don't do is really understand that,
that the,

826
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:06,480
the,
the,

827
00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:10,380
the extent to which the Inter dependency
of everything else comes into play.

828
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:15,710
And I think that's true whether you're 
introducing an animal to an ecology to 

829
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:19,491
solve a problem and it creates a bigger 
problem or whether you're taking a drug 

830
00:38:19,491 --> 00:38:24,000
to resolve one condition that has side 
effects or whether you're overly focused

831
00:38:24,001 --> 00:38:29,001
on one micronutrient or macronutrient as
the solution to your health problem.

832
00:38:29,790 --> 00:38:34,790
You know,
everything is more complicated than 

833
00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:36,831
that.
And I don't think that we kind of 

834
00:38:36,831 --> 00:38:37,630
embrace a more holistic approach to,
you know,

835
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:39,660
whether it's our problems or our health 
or,

836
00:38:39,661 --> 00:38:40,750
or,
or what have you.

837
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:43,990
That's another thing.
It's not part of our wiring and it's not

838
00:38:43,991 --> 00:38:45,100
part of the,
you know,

839
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:50,200
the scientific method is by definition 
reductionist because you have to isolate

840
00:38:50,891 --> 00:38:52,780
variables and look at one thing at a 
time.

841
00:38:52,990 --> 00:38:54,520
It's true.
That's very true.

842
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,550
It's very true.
Science in and of itself is reductionist

843
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:02,760
and I think that there's also this weird
hope that people have that have like,

844
00:39:03,430 --> 00:39:06,190
we fuck something up.
Then our backs get against the wall.

845
00:39:06,191 --> 00:39:09,490
Then someone really smart will invent a 
solution and it'll all be better.

846
00:39:09,870 --> 00:39:14,580
You know that someone like right now is 
analyzing the who knows how many fucking

847
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:18,340
trillions of pounds of plastic we've 
dumped into the ocean and they're trying

848
00:39:18,341 --> 00:39:23,341
to figure out some way to suck all that 
stuff out and turn it into some sort of 

849
00:39:23,341 --> 00:39:26,650
fuel or some resource that we can 
capitalize on.

850
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:28,180
That's those.
Those,

851
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:32,110
those kinds of thinking or that kind of 
thinking is real common.

852
00:39:32,110 --> 00:39:35,020
We always think that eventually someone 
smarter,

853
00:39:35,050 --> 00:39:37,180
we'll figure out a way out of this mess.
Elan Musk,

854
00:39:37,181 --> 00:39:39,100
it's going to solve it for all of us.
Right,

855
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:45,000
and I think that he might.
I think that part of that is just the 

856
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,810
level of disenfranchisement that the 
average person has.

857
00:39:46,811 --> 00:39:48,760
Like we just don't feel like our vote 
counts.

858
00:39:48,761 --> 00:39:51,070
We don't feel like our dollar counts and
like fuck it,

859
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:56,250
you know,
dancing with the stars is on and like I 

860
00:39:56,250 --> 00:39:59,071
can't make a difference so I'm gonna 
throw my garbage out the window and who 

861
00:39:59,071 --> 00:40:02,941
cares?
I just found out the dancing with the 

862
00:40:02,941 --> 00:40:03,820
stars have been on for 10 years has it?
I've never watched a single episode.

863
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:09,120
I really have never.
I've been flipping through the channels 

864
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:09,120
and I saw some people dancing and 
everybody cheering and I was like,

865
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:11,560
what in the actual fuck?
And I change the channel again.

866
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:14,410
Like you were watching people dance now.
Really?

867
00:40:14,530 --> 00:40:17,070
Like nobody likes to dance like that.
That was like,

868
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:22,080
okay then that will.
Isn't that what like Mexican TV was 

869
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,400
dancing with his door as well as like,
you know,

870
00:40:23,410 --> 00:40:25,630
you turn on like when we were kids it 
was like,

871
00:40:25,631 --> 00:40:27,380
it was all song and dance,
you know,

872
00:40:27,381 --> 00:40:29,830
and the Spanish television shows Spanish
network.

873
00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:31,600
I thought it was all those crazy soap 
operas.

874
00:40:31,810 --> 00:40:32,710
Yeah,
that too.

875
00:40:33,490 --> 00:40:36,050
But that's what reality TV is,
right?

876
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:41,100
We've regressed in some ways while 
there's a part of us that really we 

877
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:44,270
really love base things,
you know,

878
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:49,400
we love emotions.
Like I was just thinking of this the 

879
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,770
other day,
the talk show host like um,

880
00:40:51,070 --> 00:40:56,070
like a Morton Downey jr or Jenny Jones 
or,

881
00:40:56,410 --> 00:41:01,410
or Geraldo Rivera,
any of those shows or like Montel 

882
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:06,720
Williams where they would have guests 
and then they would go to the audience 

883
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:08,290
and the audience would like say 
something that would get everybody to go

884
00:41:10,170 --> 00:41:13,900
like that,
that thing that they created,

885
00:41:13,901 --> 00:41:14,310
that parent.

886
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:16,600
Those are like the original Youtube 
commenters.

887
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,260
There's like the original,
like social media commentators,

888
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:25,560
the people that are in the audience,
they don't have anything to do with 

889
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:28,501
what's on it,
but they get to interject and say 

890
00:41:28,501 --> 00:41:28,501
something and then that becomes a part 
of the entertainment.

891
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:30,370
But it's really just,
you know,

892
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:34,400
it's weird social interaction between 
human beings and us,

893
00:41:34,550 --> 00:41:37,540
like sitting as sidelines.
What are you showing?

894
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,420
Oh yeah,
of course.

895
00:41:40,421 --> 00:41:41,080
Sure.
Springer,

896
00:41:41,330 --> 00:41:45,140
he's the master of that.
What a crazy way to make a living.

897
00:41:45,141 --> 00:41:45,960
Right?
I mean,

898
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:47,930
when that guy was a character.
Yeah.

899
00:41:48,010 --> 00:41:49,190
Is he still is?
He's still alive,

900
00:41:49,191 --> 00:41:49,660
right?
Yeah,

901
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:50,060
yeah,
yeah,

902
00:41:50,061 --> 00:41:52,260
yeah.
He's actually a very intelligent guy.

903
00:41:52,330 --> 00:41:54,620
He wasn't even mayor prize land or 
something like that.

904
00:41:55,810 --> 00:41:59,510
And he got in troubles and prostitution.
Cincinnati,

905
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:04,520
there's a little.
I think there was a little cocaine 

906
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:05,870
problem at one blow,
but you know,

907
00:42:06,110 --> 00:42:09,500
we,
we enjoy those stupid moments that don't

908
00:42:09,501 --> 00:42:10,250
mean anything.

909
00:42:10,730 --> 00:42:15,730
You know,
where someone says something and 

910
00:42:15,730 --> 00:42:15,730
everybody goes,
oh,

911
00:42:15,730 --> 00:42:19,210
there's nothing wrong.
There's nothing wrong with a guilty 

912
00:42:19,210 --> 00:42:19,210
pleasure.
You know what I mean?

913
00:42:19,210 --> 00:42:20,000
Not necessarily.
Look,

914
00:42:20,001 --> 00:42:21,890
you can't fix the world.
You can't be captain.

915
00:42:21,891 --> 00:42:24,110
Save a hoe and go out there and fix the 
whole world.

916
00:42:24,111 --> 00:42:29,111
Now go to the Jerry springer crowd and 
start hanging out Kale leaves and you 

917
00:42:29,111 --> 00:42:32,961
know,
pamphlets for yoga classes snuck in a 

918
00:42:32,961 --> 00:42:32,961
word.
Are you talking about the ego?

919
00:42:32,961 --> 00:42:35,150
Talking about everybody,
like I eat Kale to dude,

920
00:42:35,790 --> 00:42:37,250
it is a thing,
man.

921
00:42:37,310 --> 00:42:38,450
If you,
um,

922
00:42:38,690 --> 00:42:41,290
if you've ever mocked like very,
uh,

923
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:48,000
just,
just really ridiculous proselytizing 

924
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,461
vegans,
which I have people think all of a 

925
00:42:51,461 --> 00:42:53,381
sudden just like vegans,
they think I don't like them or don't 

926
00:42:53,381 --> 00:42:54,050
eat that food.
I eat that food.

927
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:58,010
Almost always I eat more vegetables that
I eat meat.

928
00:42:58,011 --> 00:43:00,020
I way more vegetables.
I eat a lot of it.

929
00:43:00,021 --> 00:43:01,280
I think it's good for you.
Well,

930
00:43:01,281 --> 00:43:03,870
vegans are an easy target that you guys 
are easiest phone.

931
00:43:03,930 --> 00:43:05,420
I mean,
so uh,

932
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:07,310
but you're not,
you're,

933
00:43:07,311 --> 00:43:09,900
you're like,
you're like the.

934
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:11,560
If all vegans were like,
you,

935
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:15,020
there would be no target because like 
people who just eat healthy,

936
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:20,140
that's it.
You're just someone who enjoys eating 

937
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:20,750
plants instead of animal products and 
that's just,

938
00:43:20,810 --> 00:43:25,810
that's just your diet.
It doesn't become a fucking religion 

939
00:43:25,810 --> 00:43:25,810
with you.

940
00:43:25,810 --> 00:43:25,810
I mean,
look,

941
00:43:25,810 --> 00:43:28,710
first of all it's not,
it's not my place to,

942
00:43:28,890 --> 00:43:33,890
to pass judgment on anybody else in.
There are behavior patterns in their 

943
00:43:33,890 --> 00:43:35,070
habits and you know,
I'm not,

944
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:37,650
I'm not trying to,
you know,

945
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:40,530
recruit people to my lifestyle,
you know,

946
00:43:40,531 --> 00:43:43,650
if people want to ask me about it,
I'm happy to talk about it.

947
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:47,040
But I'm not like yelling from a bully 
pulpit,

948
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:51,150
you know,
shaming people or the shaming I have.

949
00:43:51,151 --> 00:43:52,890
No,
I have no,

950
00:43:52,950 --> 00:43:57,950
you know,
air of moral superiority about it 

951
00:43:57,950 --> 00:43:57,950
whatsoever.
It's a,

952
00:43:57,950 --> 00:44:01,140
it's a lifestyle that I choose,
but I don't think that,

953
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:05,370
um,
that gives me permission to,

954
00:44:05,910 --> 00:44:10,910
um,
Levy judgment on any other human being 

955
00:44:10,910 --> 00:44:10,910
and,
and their choices.

956
00:44:10,910 --> 00:44:11,830
So,
you know,

957
00:44:11,850 --> 00:44:14,650
the way that I try to communicate the 
message is to,

958
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:15,530
to,
you know,

959
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:20,540
live my life and you know,
sort of stand where I'm standing and if 

960
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:21,420
people are interested and they'll come 
to me and,

961
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:23,310
and you know,
I can communicate to them.

962
00:44:23,340 --> 00:44:26,370
But um,
but it's,

963
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:31,460
you know,
it's not a proselytizing point of view 

964
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:32,130
that I adopt.
I think some

965
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:37,130
people adopt certain behaviors just 
because it gives them license to be an 

966
00:44:37,130 --> 00:44:37,590
asshole.
I really do.

967
00:44:37,830 --> 00:44:42,830
I mean there are certain vegans that 
think that because they are vegans,

968
00:44:43,411 --> 00:44:48,411
they can go out and attack and be really
shitty to other people and somehow or 

969
00:44:48,411 --> 00:44:53,281
another they're acting in a positive way
and they're going to enact some positive

970
00:44:53,791 --> 00:44:58,791
change by being really shitty to people.
It's like this idea of a social justice 

971
00:44:59,041 --> 00:45:04,041
warrior falls into the same category by 
being really mean to people that you 

972
00:45:04,041 --> 00:45:07,881
think,
think the wrong way or behave the wrong 

973
00:45:07,881 --> 00:45:10,971
way,
that somehow or another you're going to 

974
00:45:10,971 --> 00:45:12,360
shame them into changing by being really
aggressive and offensive to them.

975
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:16,260
I mean,
shaming somebody is not an effective way

976
00:45:16,261 --> 00:45:18,540
of trying to getting them to change one 
of the least effective.

977
00:45:18,690 --> 00:45:19,440
I mean,
look,

978
00:45:19,441 --> 00:45:21,270
people change when they're ready to 
change,

979
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:23,910
you know,
it's really an internal willingness that

980
00:45:23,911 --> 00:45:28,911
drives change and you know,
somebody is either ready to make a 

981
00:45:28,911 --> 00:45:28,911
change or they're not.

982
00:45:28,911 --> 00:45:30,000
And,
and different people receive messages in

983
00:45:30,001 --> 00:45:31,470
different ways.
So if you look at,

984
00:45:32,070 --> 00:45:34,260
look,
if you look at the Vegan movement,

985
00:45:34,261 --> 00:45:36,070
because that's what we're talking about,
you know,

986
00:45:36,090 --> 00:45:39,930
there are super hardcore animal rights 
activists and they have a certain way of

987
00:45:39,931 --> 00:45:44,931
communicating and there's a certain 
population of people that are receptive 

988
00:45:44,931 --> 00:45:48,350
to that kind of communication.
There are other people that are 

989
00:45:48,350 --> 00:45:51,711
interested in environmental issues.
They want to be better 

990
00:45:51,711 --> 00:45:54,651
environmentalists.
And so there are people that speak to 

991
00:45:54,651 --> 00:45:54,651
the Vegan movement from that 
perspective.

992
00:45:54,810 --> 00:45:55,830
Um,
and,

993
00:45:55,860 --> 00:46:00,860
and there's a certain audience that's 
receptive to that and the way that I 

994
00:46:00,860 --> 00:46:03,120
communicated or carry the message is in 
a different way.

995
00:46:03,121 --> 00:46:03,810
And there's,
you know,

996
00:46:03,811 --> 00:46:05,430
different people that are attracted to 
that.

997
00:46:05,431 --> 00:46:10,431
So I think whatever your,
your point of view is or whatever 

998
00:46:10,431 --> 00:46:13,701
movement you're part of and that we can 
get into the whole idea of how we're 

999
00:46:13,701 --> 00:46:15,780
wired to be on teams and how 
counterproductive that is.

1000
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:17,070
But,
um,

1001
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:22,880
you know,
there's enough people out there that 

1002
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:22,880
are,
uh,

1003
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:26,780
you know,
there's a diversity of voices and a 

1004
00:46:26,780 --> 00:46:27,630
diversity of,
of audiences that,

1005
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:28,170
you know,
every,

1006
00:46:28,230 --> 00:46:33,230
every,
every kind of voice carries a frequency 

1007
00:46:33,230 --> 00:46:33,640
that,
that,

1008
00:46:33,930 --> 00:46:38,930
that other people respond to.
I guess I didn't say that very 

1009
00:46:38,930 --> 00:46:38,930
articulately,
but I know what you're saying though,

1010
00:46:38,930 --> 00:46:39,180
you know,
there,

1011
00:46:39,181 --> 00:46:44,181
there are definitely going to be,
there's no one that responds well to 

1012
00:46:44,181 --> 00:46:44,340
being insulted though.
No one.

1013
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:49,460
I mean,
if you're really trying to convey a 

1014
00:46:49,460 --> 00:46:49,460
message being really shitty about it is 
the last thing.

1015
00:46:49,460 --> 00:46:51,360
Well look at,
look at political talk shows on Saturday

1016
00:46:51,361 --> 00:46:54,360
and Sunday morning and they're just 
shouting at each other and and basically

1017
00:46:54,361 --> 00:46:56,490
they're just rallying support from their
base.

1018
00:46:56,491 --> 00:46:59,460
Each side they're trying to win,
but they're not,

1019
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:02,520
they're not converting people from one 
side to the other.

1020
00:47:02,670 --> 00:47:07,670
No one ever gets converted.
The only way to have anybody ever gets 

1021
00:47:07,670 --> 00:47:09,660
converted as like,
if you can say something very thoughtful

1022
00:47:09,661 --> 00:47:14,661
that penetrates past this wall of 
ideology they have in their head and 

1023
00:47:15,301 --> 00:47:17,310
they go and then they have to consider 
it,

1024
00:47:17,311 --> 00:47:18,990
but they're not going to consider if 
you're insulting.

1025
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:21,000
They're just not.
It's going to be a contest.

1026
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:24,420
It's going to be a you versus them.
You say something rude to them.

1027
00:47:24,421 --> 00:47:27,330
They're going to try say something rude 
or to you and you're,

1028
00:47:27,630 --> 00:47:29,530
you're playing ping pong,
ping pong,

1029
00:47:30,250 --> 00:47:31,270
ping pong with insults.

1030
00:47:31,540 --> 00:47:33,010
And to be clear like,
you know,

1031
00:47:33,011 --> 00:47:35,860
I'm a member of this community and you 
know,

1032
00:47:35,861 --> 00:47:38,380
I am a proud member,
I would say.

1033
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:43,400
And you a card carrying member.
I have the card in my wallet because 

1034
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:45,940
it'll leaf is a leaf.
It's in that juicy ladies.

1035
00:47:46,090 --> 00:47:49,680
Glasses don't have cards,
we just carry us here.

1036
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:51,340
You know,
my theory on it,

1037
00:47:51,430 --> 00:47:52,960
the people that are,
that are kind of,

1038
00:47:53,050 --> 00:47:58,010
you would characterize as vociferous and
angry and judgmental.

1039
00:47:58,210 --> 00:48:03,210
My theory is that there's a certain 
percentage of the population that come 

1040
00:48:03,210 --> 00:48:05,140
out of the womb.
I'm broken.

1041
00:48:05,620 --> 00:48:06,520
Well,
there's that.

1042
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:07,570
Okay.
So there's that.

1043
00:48:07,690 --> 00:48:08,580
Of course,
you know,

1044
00:48:08,620 --> 00:48:13,620
there are those people for sure.
And there are other people that I think 

1045
00:48:13,620 --> 00:48:14,840
are wired to be super sensitive.
Sure.

1046
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:19,270
And from a very early age,
they just find the idea of,

1047
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:24,360
you know,
an animal dying for food to be the most 

1048
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:24,430
intolerable concept they can imagine.

1049
00:48:24,670 --> 00:48:25,390
Right?
And they're just,

1050
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:27,640
that's,
that's how they came into the world.

1051
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:29,500
Right?
And so,

1052
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:34,360
and so they kind of grow older and they 
navigate the world and they start,

1053
00:48:34,390 --> 00:48:39,390
you know,
becoming sort of more outspoken about 

1054
00:48:39,390 --> 00:48:42,451
this idea and when people are not 
receptive to it or they're not seeing 

1055
00:48:42,451 --> 00:48:43,090
the world the way that they're seeing 
it,

1056
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:45,790
they become progressively more 
frustrated.

1057
00:48:46,180 --> 00:48:48,160
And that frustration turns to 
resentment.

1058
00:48:48,580 --> 00:48:51,700
That resentment can morph into anger and
then you know,

1059
00:48:51,701 --> 00:48:54,380
you have what you see which is,
which is people who are,

1060
00:48:54,430 --> 00:48:59,430
they're just,
they're just incensed that other people 

1061
00:48:59,430 --> 00:48:59,430
are not seeing the world the way that 
they're seeing it.

1062
00:48:59,590 --> 00:49:04,590
And I think that applies to any 
contingent of the population that holds 

1063
00:49:04,590 --> 00:49:05,470
a very strong point of view.

1064
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:07,220
I,
I agree with you.

1065
00:49:07,221 --> 00:49:09,280
I think that there's,
there,

1066
00:49:09,340 --> 00:49:14,340
there's definitely going to be certain 
people that are hardwired for 

1067
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:17,111
sensitivity.
There's just no getting around it and 

1068
00:49:17,111 --> 00:49:17,111
you realize that when you have children,
you know,

1069
00:49:17,111 --> 00:49:20,150
I have two young daughters that are so 
different.

1070
00:49:20,151 --> 00:49:21,680
They're only two years apart from each 
other,

1071
00:49:21,950 --> 00:49:24,590
grew up in the same household.
They could not be more different.

1072
00:49:24,591 --> 00:49:26,540
Right.
It's just right out of the box.

1073
00:49:26,570 --> 00:49:27,400
They're just different people.

1074
00:49:27,830 --> 00:49:32,830
Yeah.
You realize like he had nothing to do 

1075
00:49:32,830 --> 00:49:32,830
with that.
Yeah.

1076
00:49:32,830 --> 00:49:32,830
I mean

1077
00:49:32,830 --> 00:49:34,710
you have a little bit to do with how 
they,

1078
00:49:35,210 --> 00:49:38,730
how they process things and how they 
deal with things based on learned

1079
00:49:38,810 --> 00:49:43,810
that innate core kind of perspective and
whatever they're naturally inclined to 

1080
00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:46,730
is just,
you can see it at such a young age.

1081
00:49:47,220 --> 00:49:48,390
Yeah,
that's the difference,

1082
00:49:48,391 --> 00:49:51,060
right?
The difference is like what,

1083
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:56,240
what is a real part of them?
What is a real part of them?

1084
00:49:56,730 --> 00:49:58,110
Like what,
what,

1085
00:49:58,111 --> 00:50:03,111
what is just inescapable.
Like they have certain ingredients like 

1086
00:50:03,111 --> 00:50:05,550
a car is made out of aluminum and rubber
and metal.

1087
00:50:05,850 --> 00:50:10,850
There's certain ingredients that certain
people have when they're born and also 

1088
00:50:10,850 --> 00:50:15,530
inclinations,
inclinations towards certain activities 

1089
00:50:15,530 --> 00:50:19,491
like we were talking about before,
like trying to find things that make 

1090
00:50:19,491 --> 00:50:19,920
your children happy and try and 
encourage things that make your children

1091
00:50:19,921 --> 00:50:24,921
happy to find a thing that they like 
that jives with their ingredients.

1092
00:50:26,610 --> 00:50:28,490
And some people

1093
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:33,520
they look at animals and they just have 
this inescapable in this capable kinship

1094
00:50:33,710 --> 00:50:35,510
and some of the,
someone that kinship is ridiculous.

1095
00:50:35,530 --> 00:50:40,530
The point where he ever read those 
tumblr blogs where people think that 

1096
00:50:40,530 --> 00:50:41,130
there should have been born a fox,
have fox,

1097
00:50:41,131 --> 00:50:46,131
can you never seen that?
That sounds like something red band 

1098
00:50:46,131 --> 00:50:47,180
which spent a lot of time doing with 
thinking he used to be just being,

1099
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:49,630
you know,
being on like weird tumblr sites.

1100
00:50:49,950 --> 00:50:54,950
Um,
we're tumblr sites can get very 

1101
00:50:54,950 --> 00:50:57,071
addictive.
You wonder whether or not you're being 

1102
00:50:57,071 --> 00:50:57,071
trolled,
you know,

1103
00:50:57,071 --> 00:50:57,071
some of them are so weird.
You wonder like,

1104
00:50:57,071 --> 00:50:58,490
okay,
so this is this real,

1105
00:50:59,390 --> 00:51:00,680
you know?
Yeah.

1106
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:02,840
I don't know.
Fox can you never heard of that?

1107
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:07,900
No,
I haven't to look around at people that 

1108
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:07,900
they,
they,

1109
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:08,030
they believe that they should have been 
born as foxes.

1110
00:51:08,270 --> 00:51:09,260
Yes.
Okay.

1111
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:12,680
They believe their Fox came spirit open 
minded thinker.

1112
00:51:13,610 --> 00:51:18,610
There's other dimensions that play.
You saw interstellar I didn't see in 

1113
00:51:18,610 --> 00:51:19,520
yourself that you didn't know.
I haven't seen it yet.

1114
00:51:19,610 --> 00:51:20,660
I'm fucking busy,
Bro.

1115
00:51:21,220 --> 00:51:22,760
Uh,
but the,

1116
00:51:22,761 --> 00:51:24,360
um,
the idea is just,

1117
00:51:25,270 --> 00:51:30,270
that's a ridiculous idea.
But I also think that there's also 

1118
00:51:30,270 --> 00:51:31,880
people that have this very idealistic 
idea of animals and nature itself,

1119
00:51:31,881 --> 00:51:32,720
which is,
hey,

1120
00:51:32,730 --> 00:51:37,730
there's some videos we've been shown 
recently with a deer that are eating 

1121
00:51:37,730 --> 00:51:39,740
birds,
eating birds alive,

1122
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:44,800
which apparently is a recent discovery 
that deer are not really just 

1123
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:47,240
herbivores.
They're herbivores by convenience,

1124
00:51:47,570 --> 00:51:49,640
but when they find a birds on the 
ground,

1125
00:51:49,641 --> 00:51:51,780
they eat them and they seek them out.
They actually chased them.

1126
00:51:52,750 --> 00:51:57,750
Is that a result of encroaching habitat 
by urban centers or no?

1127
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:02,920
No.
These are wild beer in very rural areas 

1128
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:03,910
there have been observed to.
It's uh,

1129
00:52:03,980 --> 00:52:06,020
apparently they're getting minerals and 
stuff from,

1130
00:52:06,140 --> 00:52:08,360
from deer,
from a bird's brother,

1131
00:52:08,630 --> 00:52:13,630
and um,
they're more inclined to do so when 

1132
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:13,630
they're growing their antlers.

1133
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:13,630
They feel,
you know,

1134
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:14,330
more,
uh,

1135
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:17,630
more drawn to eating birds.
That's interesting.

1136
00:52:17,631 --> 00:52:18,620
I didn't know that.
Yeah,

1137
00:52:18,621 --> 00:52:21,430
there's a bunch of videos.
It's kind of disturbing because you,

1138
00:52:21,431 --> 00:52:24,710
you know,
even though I'm a hunter and I eat deer,

1139
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:30,220
I think they're beautiful and I always 
think of him as being these peaceful 

1140
00:52:30,220 --> 00:52:34,061
things and we see them chasing a bird 
and just chewing it alive and fucking 

1141
00:52:34,761 --> 00:52:37,400
things kicking inside of their mouth and
trying to get away.

1142
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:38,450
Well,
they're just,

1143
00:52:38,630 --> 00:52:40,340
they're part of the,
you know,

1144
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:45,400
natural cycle of life.
They're just trying to survive like 

1145
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:45,770
everything else.
And I think,

1146
00:52:46,790 --> 00:52:49,430
you know,
I think to the casual observer,

1147
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:54,760
you know,
or somebody who's listening to this 

1148
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:56,171
podcast,
they may think that there's this giant 

1149
00:52:56,171 --> 00:52:57,710
gap between the way that you live in a 
way that I live.

1150
00:52:57,711 --> 00:53:00,780
And I think there's actually a bigger 
gap between the way that I live in,

1151
00:53:00,790 --> 00:53:02,930
in the normal human being than yourself 
because of,

1152
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:04,160
you know,
look,

1153
00:53:04,190 --> 00:53:05,540
you're a hunter.
I don't hunt,

1154
00:53:05,570 --> 00:53:10,570
you know,
it's not something that I'm interested 

1155
00:53:10,570 --> 00:53:12,371
in doing,
but you have a connection to where your 

1156
00:53:12,371 --> 00:53:12,900
food is coming from that is very,
um,

1157
00:53:13,730 --> 00:53:15,260
close and primal.
And,

1158
00:53:15,380 --> 00:53:20,180
and in the grand scheme of things more 
sustainable than the way that,

1159
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:22,550
you know,
the average typical American,

1160
00:53:22,910 --> 00:53:25,860
it's kind of more sustainable.
But honestly,

1161
00:53:25,890 --> 00:53:26,460
not

1162
00:53:26,580 --> 00:53:28,080
for everybody.
The reality,

1163
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:30,430
not everybody could do it,
you know,

1164
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:31,910
not everybody can do it.
I mean,

1165
00:53:31,911 --> 00:53:36,911
I think that,
that right now our food system is 

1166
00:53:36,911 --> 00:53:37,520
broken.
You know,

1167
00:53:37,521 --> 00:53:37,880
our,
our,

1168
00:53:37,890 --> 00:53:39,770
our,
our system of factory farming.

1169
00:53:39,771 --> 00:53:44,771
It's unsustainable.
I actually brought you this documentary 

1170
00:53:44,771 --> 00:53:47,150
called cowspiracy spirits.
Oh,

1171
00:53:47,151 --> 00:53:48,670
cowspiracy.
Yeah.

1172
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:53,880
Yeah.
I was involved in a producing this 

1173
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:53,880
movie.
You should check it out.

1174
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:57,311
But basically it's a look at,
at the impact of animal agriculture on 

1175
00:53:58,970 --> 00:54:00,320
our environment.
And it's hard.

1176
00:54:00,350 --> 00:54:01,310
It's pretty interesting.

1177
00:54:01,420 --> 00:54:06,420
Did you see that,
that video that they got a drone video 

1178
00:54:06,430 --> 00:54:11,430
of these gigantic pig farms and the just
the fucking unbelievable environmental 

1179
00:54:13,661 --> 00:54:18,661
catastrophe these things create.
Would they have lakes of piss and shit 

1180
00:54:19,390 --> 00:54:21,040
from these pigs?
It's different.

1181
00:54:21,310 --> 00:54:26,310
Have you seen it now?
Haven't you really should see it and 

1182
00:54:26,310 --> 00:54:26,310
perceiving it?
Pull that video up,

1183
00:54:26,310 --> 00:54:26,490
Jamie,
because it's.

1184
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:30,220
It's insane to look at.
When you stop and think about the,

1185
00:54:30,221 --> 00:54:30,770
the,
the,

1186
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:34,540
the amount of Smithfield foods,
factory farms.

1187
00:54:34,541 --> 00:54:38,200
That's it right there.
If this guy flies his drone,

1188
00:54:38,201 --> 00:54:43,201
which is pretty fucking cool that they 
have these drones now that you could do 

1189
00:54:43,201 --> 00:54:45,961
this and get this high resolution video.
Well if you're dealing with a place like

1190
00:54:46,271 --> 00:54:47,510
Los Angeles,
$20,

1191
00:54:47,511 --> 00:54:52,511
million people,
20 million people and 95 percent of the 

1192
00:54:52,511 --> 00:54:56,041
meat meat,
you're dealing with an insane amount of 

1193
00:54:56,041 --> 00:54:59,221
flash that needs to be consumed on a 
daily basis and it has to be grown 

1194
00:54:59,221 --> 00:55:00,580
somewhere and ship somewhere and 
conveniently.

1195
00:55:00,580 --> 00:55:05,580
We want to sort of ignore it like that 
is a lake of shit and piss and it's all 

1196
00:55:06,821 --> 00:55:10,840
coming from these factories right there 
in front of you.

1197
00:55:11,110 --> 00:55:16,110
Those are housing units for pigs,
they're stuffed into these things 

1198
00:55:16,110 --> 00:55:19,360
crammed next to each other and they 
stand on these metal grates.

1199
00:55:19,690 --> 00:55:22,150
So the metal grates are poorest.
They piss and shit.

1200
00:55:22,151 --> 00:55:27,151
It goes through the holes and it all 
goes through these tubes that lead down 

1201
00:55:27,151 --> 00:55:29,410
into that giant lake.
Apparently the smell,

1202
00:55:29,411 --> 00:55:34,411
if you're anywhere near there is so bad.
You literally feel like you could 

1203
00:55:34,411 --> 00:55:35,680
probably like the air on fire.

1204
00:55:36,270 --> 00:55:39,480
I'm sure Smithfield,
Smithfield is not too excited about this

1205
00:55:39,481 --> 00:55:44,481
video being out there and you know,
there's all these ag gag laws right now 

1206
00:55:44,481 --> 00:55:45,720
that prevent consumers from filming this
kind of thing.

1207
00:55:45,721 --> 00:55:49,470
So that's insane that he's been able to 
do this with a drone and you know,

1208
00:55:49,471 --> 00:55:50,900
whether you're,
you know,

1209
00:55:50,910 --> 00:55:54,570
whether you eat bacon for breakfast 
every morning or you eat more like me.

1210
00:55:54,571 --> 00:55:58,680
I think we can all agree that,
that transparency is important and these

1211
00:55:58,681 --> 00:56:03,681
companies are not transparent about how 
they produce their food and there's a 

1212
00:56:03,681 --> 00:56:07,551
lot of problems with it and the waste 
that it creates and the amount of 

1213
00:56:07,551 --> 00:56:11,370
resources and you know,
what goes into this process is something

1214
00:56:11,371 --> 00:56:14,790
that I think we could all benefit from 
taking a harder look at.

1215
00:56:14,850 --> 00:56:19,850
You know,
it'd be interesting is if you go to the 

1216
00:56:19,850 --> 00:56:19,850
um,
cowspiracy website,

1217
00:56:19,850 --> 00:56:21,510
they have all these facts about kind of,
you know,

1218
00:56:21,511 --> 00:56:24,160
every sort of environmental of,
of

1219
00:56:24,250 --> 00:56:29,250
what animal agriculture does from water 
use to see co two emissions to land use 

1220
00:56:29,250 --> 00:56:32,090
to species extinction to rainforest 
destruction.

1221
00:56:32,091 --> 00:56:33,820
And when you look at the statistics,
it's,

1222
00:56:33,930 --> 00:56:35,860
it's crazy.
It's absolutely crazy.

1223
00:56:35,861 --> 00:56:38,260
It's like the elephant in the room,
you know,

1224
00:56:38,261 --> 00:56:40,570
we talk about when we talk about global 
climate change or,

1225
00:56:40,571 --> 00:56:42,880
or greenhouse gas emissions,
we talk about,

1226
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:47,290
we talk about fossil fuel use,
we talk about fracking and rightly so.

1227
00:56:47,291 --> 00:56:48,970
These are important things to talk 
about.

1228
00:56:48,971 --> 00:56:53,800
But really the thing that we're not 
talking enough about is the impact of,

1229
00:56:53,890 --> 00:56:56,680
of our food system on all of these 
systems.

1230
00:56:56,681 --> 00:56:58,300
And when you look at,
for example,

1231
00:56:58,301 --> 00:56:59,590
water use,
we're talking about water,

1232
00:56:59,591 --> 00:57:00,250
right?
Well,

1233
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:04,630
you know there's PSA is in California,
we're not supposed to take long showers,

1234
00:57:04,631 --> 00:57:06,760
we can't water our lawns,
all these sorts of things.

1235
00:57:06,790 --> 00:57:11,790
And the truth is is that consumer water 
use in California is like five percent 

1236
00:57:11,790 --> 00:57:16,120
and animal agriculture accounts for like
55 percent of all water use.

1237
00:57:16,140 --> 00:57:19,210
And you know what a bonus.
You know what the really big useless one

1238
00:57:19,211 --> 00:57:19,720
is?
Well,

1239
00:57:19,810 --> 00:57:22,310
golf quality horses.
Well animal agriculture,

1240
00:57:22,390 --> 00:57:27,390
trump's golf courses,
at least animal agriculture is like 

1241
00:57:27,390 --> 00:57:27,390
feeding animals at,
right?

1242
00:57:27,410 --> 00:57:29,920
Right.
You just feeding fuck right.

1243
00:57:30,070 --> 00:57:32,260
Dude's rolling balls around on the 
grass.

1244
00:57:32,350 --> 00:57:37,350
That's an insane,
insane amount of water for your 

1245
00:57:37,350 --> 00:57:37,350
amusement.
Yeah.

1246
00:57:37,350 --> 00:57:41,880
I think it takes something like 660 
gallons of water to produce a hamburger 

1247
00:57:43,210 --> 00:57:47,980
and like a thousand gallons of milk or a
thousand gallons of water to produce one

1248
00:57:47,981 --> 00:57:49,330
gallon of milk.
Something like that.

1249
00:57:49,331 --> 00:57:51,940
Like the,
the statistics are completely insane and

1250
00:57:51,941 --> 00:57:56,941
that.
Because a lot of it is the water that's 

1251
00:57:56,941 --> 00:57:56,941
used to grow the grain that you're 
feeding to these animals.

1252
00:57:56,941 --> 00:57:58,710
So when you look at it systemically,
you know,

1253
00:57:58,750 --> 00:58:03,250
it's just,
it doesn't like if you were an alien who

1254
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:08,280
beamed down to planet earth and said,
take me to your leader and show me how 

1255
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:08,280
you make your food.

1256
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:09,730
He would just be like,
you guys are crazy.

1257
00:58:09,731 --> 00:58:11,520
You're like killing the planet to do 
this,

1258
00:58:11,540 --> 00:58:12,250
doesn't it?
Doesn't.

1259
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:15,290
It doesn't make sense.
Not Sustainable in the longterm.

1260
00:58:16,130 --> 00:58:19,900
If we did it exactly the way we're doing
it right now forever.

1261
00:58:19,901 --> 00:58:22,420
Would that be sustainable?
I don't think so.

1262
00:58:22,450 --> 00:58:23,450
Can we can do it right now?
Well,

1263
00:58:23,451 --> 00:58:25,660
I mean we're.
The way that we're doing it right now.

1264
00:58:25,661 --> 00:58:29,230
I mean we're destroying like rain forest
like crazy,

1265
00:58:29,260 --> 00:58:30,850
right?
It's like one to two acres,

1266
00:58:30,851 --> 00:58:32,950
like every hour or something like that.
Isn't that.

1267
00:58:32,951 --> 00:58:37,060
A lot of it is due to their,
they're getting exotic hardwoods and all

1268
00:58:37,061 --> 00:58:40,450
these different and saw lumbering and 
there's some of that for sure.

1269
00:58:40,451 --> 00:58:42,730
And there's palm oil and there's other 
things like that.

1270
00:58:42,731 --> 00:58:47,731
But I think the gravity men,
like the majority of it goes to grazing 

1271
00:58:47,731 --> 00:58:49,630
land and growing crops for,
for livestock.

1272
00:58:49,660 --> 00:58:51,820
And this is other countries.
This is not America,

1273
00:58:51,980 --> 00:58:55,530
America Amazonian rain forest.
We're not cutting down the rainforest in

1274
00:58:55,540 --> 00:58:57,640
America and we're not getting our beef 
from there either,

1275
00:58:58,240 --> 00:58:59,290
but I think,
you know,

1276
00:58:59,291 --> 00:59:02,620
like an insane amount of our total land 
mass is devoted to,

1277
00:59:02,890 --> 00:59:05,320
is devoted to animal agriculture too.
So,

1278
00:59:05,970 --> 00:59:10,090
you know,
it's like billions of these animals that

1279
00:59:10,091 --> 00:59:12,910
were specifically raising to eat,
you know,

1280
00:59:12,930 --> 00:59:13,960
and it's,
it's a,

1281
00:59:14,050 --> 00:59:16,750
it's a huge,
it's a huge problem.

1282
00:59:17,140 --> 00:59:22,140
It is a huge problem.
That is something that is outside of 

1283
00:59:22,140 --> 00:59:22,310
your normal

1284
00:59:22,310 --> 00:59:27,310
thinking,
normal everyday thinking you're getting 

1285
00:59:27,310 --> 00:59:27,310
on the highway,
goddammit.

1286
00:59:27,310 --> 00:59:27,650
There's traffic today.
You're getting to work.

1287
00:59:27,651 --> 00:59:32,651
Oh Great.
We've got this new project we have to 

1288
00:59:32,651 --> 00:59:32,651
deal with and you're,
you're,

1289
00:59:32,651 --> 00:59:34,490
you're real existence.
Like all that stuff is bullshit.

1290
00:59:34,491 --> 00:59:36,830
If you don't have any food,
all that traffic,

1291
00:59:36,831 --> 00:59:38,540
all the work stuff like,
hey,

1292
00:59:38,580 --> 00:59:41,090
you're gonna die.
You don't have any food.

1293
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:46,360
Like this is like here's,
here's a bunch of things that you need 

1294
00:59:46,360 --> 00:59:49,331
to have in place before you think about 
any other hobbies or projects or 

1295
00:59:49,331 --> 00:59:51,410
whatever you're trying to accomplish 
with your career.

1296
00:59:52,180 --> 00:59:54,470
You got to have a place where you can 
breathe.

1297
00:59:54,471 --> 00:59:55,760
The air,
okay,

1298
00:59:55,761 --> 00:59:58,820
the air has to be clean.
That's one on the ocean,

1299
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:03,440
has to be hospitable for fish and plant 
life for us.

1300
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:04,610
Well,
if you're a Vegan,

1301
01:00:04,611 --> 01:00:09,611
you really don't need to worry about 
anything other than the plant life in 

1302
01:00:09,611 --> 01:00:11,861
the ocean if you're only kelp,
but actually calculate a very good 

1303
01:00:11,861 --> 01:00:11,861
source of protein.

1304
01:00:11,861 --> 01:00:13,040
That goes back to this reductionist 
idea,

1305
01:00:13,100 --> 01:00:14,890
right?
These are complex ecosystems,

1306
01:00:14,891 --> 01:00:18,140
so you knock one thing out in the ocean 
and the domino effect of that,

1307
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:23,200
you know like these,
the runoff that's caused from waste 

1308
01:00:23,390 --> 01:00:25,820
animal agriculture is a big one.
There's all kinds of ways.

1309
01:00:25,850 --> 01:00:30,850
Just Susan the ocean,
and it creates these massive dead zone 

1310
01:00:30,850 --> 01:00:31,400
dead zones.
The Algal blooms,

1311
01:00:31,401 --> 01:00:33,020
right?
That deprives them like,

1312
01:00:33,380 --> 01:00:38,380
like thousands of acres worth across the
ocean that are so oxygen deprived that 

1313
01:00:39,051 --> 01:00:40,610
nothing can live in them.
Well,

1314
01:00:40,611 --> 01:00:44,570
there was a big die off when I was in 
her most a beach a couple of years ago.

1315
01:00:45,350 --> 01:00:47,510
They had a giant fish die off where it 
was.

1316
01:00:47,630 --> 01:00:49,280
Oh,
so fucking stinky.

1317
01:00:49,281 --> 01:00:51,260
It was so nasty.
Wash up on the shore.

1318
01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:56,320
Well,
I think they just died like in certain 

1319
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:56,320
bays,
you know,

1320
01:00:56,320 --> 01:01:00,100
there was an,
an area where they just hit a dead zone 

1321
01:01:00,100 --> 01:01:03,101
and a bunch of fish died and supernormal
very common happens all the time and it 

1322
01:01:03,591 --> 01:01:05,300
smelled so bad.

1323
01:01:05,330 --> 01:01:05,920
It was just,
you know,

1324
01:01:06,060 --> 01:01:08,010
probably a fucking million dead fish or 
something.

1325
01:01:08,011 --> 01:01:09,320
I'll.
Yeah,

1326
01:01:09,590 --> 01:01:11,690
awful.
But when we're.

1327
01:01:11,691 --> 01:01:13,040
So what we're getting at,
but.

1328
01:01:13,041 --> 01:01:13,790
But I mean,
yeah,

1329
01:01:13,791 --> 01:01:17,360
I mean as you know,
as typical consumers were,

1330
01:01:18,020 --> 01:01:20,360
were divorced from that.
That's not in our face.

1331
01:01:20,420 --> 01:01:21,770
You know what I mean?
Like we're not really,

1332
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:24,410
we don't have to reckon with that on a 
daily basis,

1333
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:29,440
is it possible that like,
could you have an entire city of 20 

1334
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:34,240
million people?
You couldn't have an entire city of 20 

1335
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:34,240
million people that lived as hunters.
You really couldn't.

1336
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:39,010
You would need more animals.
But could you have an entire city of 20 

1337
01:01:39,010 --> 01:01:39,860
million people that were Vegan?
Oh yeah.

1338
01:01:39,861 --> 01:01:40,240
I mean,
I,

1339
01:01:40,241 --> 01:01:43,340
I think that,
that the amount of land that you need to

1340
01:01:43,341 --> 01:01:45,860
grow food for vegans is like,
you know,

1341
01:01:45,890 --> 01:01:47,690
I don't know,
a fraction,

1342
01:01:47,691 --> 01:01:52,691
a tiny fraction of the amount of land 
that is required to raise animals for 

1343
01:01:52,691 --> 01:01:55,600
food because the animals have to eat a 
lot of food in order to get to a size.

1344
01:01:56,060 --> 01:01:56,750
I mean,
you need,

1345
01:01:56,780 --> 01:01:59,410
you need tons of grazing land and,
and you know,

1346
01:01:59,840 --> 01:02:04,840
like if you go to go to cowspiracy.com
and there's a section called facts and 

1347
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:05,860
they kind of break it all down.
It's kind of interesting to look at.

1348
01:02:05,900 --> 01:02:06,500
Um,
but,

1349
01:02:07,100 --> 01:02:08,390
but yeah,
I mean I think that,

1350
01:02:08,420 --> 01:02:12,500
that the amount of land,
like we're producing enough food to feed

1351
01:02:12,501 --> 01:02:17,501
the planet really.
It's really like an allocation and 

1352
01:02:17,501 --> 01:02:18,220
distribution issue as much as any 
meeting we use like American,

1353
01:02:18,300 --> 01:02:20,400
but most of the food that we're growing

1354
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:23,070
in the bread basket of America is going 
to livestock.

1355
01:02:23,430 --> 01:02:26,010
It's not going to human beings.
I mean like the corn fields,

1356
01:02:26,380 --> 01:02:29,700
they're also making that core and that's
really not even edible for humans.

1357
01:02:30,090 --> 01:02:30,530
That,
uh,

1358
01:02:30,700 --> 01:02:33,120
you see you saw king corn?
Uh,

1359
01:02:33,121 --> 01:02:33,630
yeah,
I did.

1360
01:02:33,631 --> 01:02:35,850
It's amazing,
amazing documentary.

1361
01:02:35,851 --> 01:02:38,190
We're all like made out of fucking crazy
when they,

1362
01:02:38,460 --> 01:02:43,460
when they do the tests on their body and
they find out that the carbon for core 

1363
01:02:43,460 --> 01:02:47,461
and then human,
the carbon in their body is coming from 

1364
01:02:47,461 --> 01:02:47,670
corn.
If you find out how much,

1365
01:02:48,120 --> 01:02:53,120
how many different things at the 
supermarket when they went through the 

1366
01:02:53,120 --> 01:02:55,791
supermarket,
they looked at all the different things 

1367
01:02:55,791 --> 01:02:55,791
that have corn syrup and corn starch,
corn,

1368
01:02:55,791 --> 01:02:55,950
corn,
this corn that.

1369
01:02:55,980 --> 01:02:57,150
It's like,
wow,

1370
01:02:57,900 --> 01:03:02,900
how did that happen?
How did they hijack the entire food 

1371
01:03:02,900 --> 01:03:02,900
system?
I mean,

1372
01:03:02,900 --> 01:03:05,160
you don't write amazing.
He'd fucking corn,

1373
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:10,440
you know,
like all that stuff that they're using 

1374
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:12,951
corn for is not really necessary,
but you can profit off of it if you own 

1375
01:03:13,741 --> 01:03:18,741
the corn and if you have some sort of a 
relationship with the government,

1376
01:03:19,170 --> 01:03:23,460
you can get a subsidy subsidy's and 
that's what happens.

1377
01:03:23,460 --> 01:03:24,840
They're,
they're being fed off subsidies.

1378
01:03:25,050 --> 01:03:26,820
That's one of the things that was most 
disturbing about it.

1379
01:03:26,821 --> 01:03:27,240
Like,
wait a minute,

1380
01:03:27,420 --> 01:03:32,420
this is so destructive and this is.
And you guys couldn't even afford to 

1381
01:03:32,420 --> 01:03:33,480
grow this shit if it wasn't for the 
government.

1382
01:03:34,280 --> 01:03:37,560
If the government didn't pay corn 
farmers,

1383
01:03:37,810 --> 01:03:41,460
they didn't have government subsidies,
a lot of them would just go under.

1384
01:03:41,560 --> 01:03:43,340
Yeah,
I mean I think that we're,

1385
01:03:43,341 --> 01:03:46,920
we're entrenched in this system that is 
dependent upon these subsidies.

1386
01:03:46,921 --> 01:03:51,921
Right?
And so much of our economy functions in 

1387
01:03:51,921 --> 01:03:54,771
this way.
And I think if we really want to change 

1388
01:03:54,771 --> 01:03:54,771
our food system,
we have to eradicate these subsidies.

1389
01:03:54,771 --> 01:03:56,340
And when you look at,
you know,

1390
01:03:56,341 --> 01:03:57,930
look,
there's a reason why.

1391
01:03:58,320 --> 01:04:00,290
I think we talked about this last time.
I can't remember.

1392
01:04:00,330 --> 01:04:04,200
There's a reason why like Taco Bell Taco
is like whatever it is,

1393
01:04:04,370 --> 01:04:07,650
dollar and nine cents or whatever.
And it's like it's the same price.

1394
01:04:07,650 --> 01:04:11,280
It was when we were 12.
Like how does that work?

1395
01:04:12,050 --> 01:04:17,050
You know,
a Mcdonald's cheeseburger is like two 

1396
01:04:17,050 --> 01:04:18,030
bucks or whatever it is.
But if you factor in,

1397
01:04:18,031 --> 01:04:23,031
like if you look at it from a Meta 
perspective and you take into account 

1398
01:04:23,031 --> 01:04:24,360
all the subsidies,
you know,

1399
01:04:24,361 --> 01:04:27,720
a big Mac would actually cost something 
like 7:50

1400
01:04:27,721 --> 01:04:30,270
or you know,
it'd be like a multiple on its price.

1401
01:04:30,271 --> 01:04:33,900
There's a book called metagenomics by 
this guy called David Simon where he,

1402
01:04:34,470 --> 01:04:35,640
I'm sorry,
meet and Omics,

1403
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:41,240
and he really breaks down how these 
subsidies work and how that kind of 

1404
01:04:41,240 --> 01:04:44,061
fuels this food system that really is 
creating it.

1405
01:04:44,470 --> 01:04:46,270
It's sort of,
it's,

1406
01:04:46,650 --> 01:04:48,540
it's making the,
the,

1407
01:04:48,541 --> 01:04:51,540
um,
the lower socioeconomic class,

1408
01:04:51,541 --> 01:04:56,541
like less and less healthy because it's 
creating this wider gap between healthy 

1409
01:04:56,541 --> 01:04:59,100
living and unhealthy living because in 
food deserts,

1410
01:04:59,101 --> 01:05:02,400
in urban food deserts where there is no 
farmer's market,

1411
01:05:02,401 --> 01:05:06,090
but there's Mcdonald's and Jack in the 
box on every corner and you know,

1412
01:05:06,091 --> 01:05:07,950
you're on welfare and you got three 
kids,

1413
01:05:07,951 --> 01:05:08,970
like,
what are you going to do?

1414
01:05:09,090 --> 01:05:14,090
Right?
You're going to eat shitty food is too 

1415
01:05:14,090 --> 01:05:14,400
cheap to not.
That's a really good point.

1416
01:05:14,820 --> 01:05:18,370
That's a really good point as far as the
amount that it costs

1417
01:05:18,760 --> 01:05:22,930
for these things and that the fact that 
it's because of subsidies as a result of

1418
01:05:22,931 --> 01:05:27,610
that we're in this place right now where
suddenly health and wellness have become

1419
01:05:27,670 --> 01:05:29,130
elitist ideals,
you know,

1420
01:05:29,230 --> 01:05:31,090
synonymous with,
you know,

1421
01:05:31,150 --> 01:05:34,000
spending a ton of money at whole foods 
and that's crazy.

1422
01:05:34,210 --> 01:05:37,300
Are you opposed to eating like chicken 
eggs,

1423
01:05:37,350 --> 01:05:42,350
like from someone who grows chickens and
has them like free ranging and you know,

1424
01:05:43,330 --> 01:05:48,140
like I have chickens that they,
they lay eggs every day and they're,

1425
01:05:48,141 --> 01:05:49,840
they're essentially my pets.
I eat,

1426
01:05:49,930 --> 01:05:52,200
I eat my pet's food,
you know,

1427
01:05:52,210 --> 01:05:57,210
I feed them,
they eat a lot of the table scraps but 

1428
01:05:57,210 --> 01:05:57,560
they,
they,

1429
01:05:57,760 --> 01:05:59,770
a lot of them,
they just free range.

1430
01:05:59,771 --> 01:06:04,771
They run around eating stuff in the 
grass and bugs and from like an ethical 

1431
01:06:05,051 --> 01:06:05,950
point of view,
you know,

1432
01:06:06,970 --> 01:06:11,970
if you're raising your own chickens and 
they're like your pets and they're 

1433
01:06:11,970 --> 01:06:12,760
laying eggs that are not going to be,
you know,

1434
01:06:12,790 --> 01:06:17,790
turn into chickens than I think 
ethically I don't really see a problem 

1435
01:06:18,101 --> 01:06:18,550
with that.

1436
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:22,030
You know what I mean?
Like like they're not going to,

1437
01:06:22,120 --> 01:06:24,490
you know,
they're not going to knock those eggs,

1438
01:06:24,491 --> 01:06:29,491
are not going to turn into chickens,
but Peter has this thing on their 

1439
01:06:29,491 --> 01:06:32,491
website about eggs being chicken periods
and they're trying to discourage people 

1440
01:06:32,491 --> 01:06:33,850
from eating eggs.
Have you ever seen it?

1441
01:06:34,750 --> 01:06:39,750
It's hilarious.
It's one of those things where it just 

1442
01:06:39,750 --> 01:06:40,480
shows you like the.
There's,

1443
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:46,080
there's ethical considerations when it 
comes to livestock and animals that are 

1444
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:47,650
there.
They've rational,

1445
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:52,680
they make sense.
And then you get into this extreme 

1446
01:06:52,680 --> 01:06:56,221
animal rights ideology where they try to
twist reality and so they have like a 

1447
01:06:56,221 --> 01:06:59,230
bloody bloody pair of underwear and a 
chicken.

1448
01:06:59,260 --> 01:07:00,200
Like here it is.
Look at this.

1449
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:05,880
Eggs come from chicken menstruation.
So they're frying a bloody pair of 

1450
01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:09,391
underwear in a frying pan.
Don't eat eggs period.

1451
01:07:09,910 --> 01:07:13,990
And the word period is red,
like period blood.

1452
01:07:14,310 --> 01:07:17,560
I mean this is the stage of my Peta.
They're very effective at marketing.

1453
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:20,500
They were talking while we're talking 
about it right now,

1454
01:07:20,501 --> 01:07:21,910
we're talking about how retarded they 
are.

1455
01:07:21,911 --> 01:07:24,610
I eat seven more eggs today just because
of these assets.

1456
01:07:25,350 --> 01:07:27,540
That's not,
that's not like effective.

1457
01:07:28,430 --> 01:07:29,080
If you're.
If,

1458
01:07:29,170 --> 01:07:34,170
if you have chickens at your home and 
they're your pets and your kids play 

1459
01:07:34,170 --> 01:07:37,981
with them and they're laying eggs that 
are not going to turn into chickens and 

1460
01:07:37,981 --> 01:07:38,770
you decide that you want to eat those 
eggs from a,

1461
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:41,820
from a morality point of view,
like how can I.

1462
01:07:42,100 --> 01:07:47,100
I don't,
I don't really see how I could have a 

1463
01:07:47,100 --> 01:07:49,291
big problem with that.
Now if you decide that you want to cut 

1464
01:07:49,291 --> 01:07:52,351
the head off that chicken and fry it up,
then then when it comes up because well 

1465
01:07:52,351 --> 01:07:53,610
it's becomes a different thing.
Right?

1466
01:07:53,650 --> 01:07:55,480
Becomes different than becomes a 
different thing.

1467
01:07:56,110 --> 01:07:59,020
What was the last time he ate meat?
So it's been awhile.

1468
01:07:59,110 --> 01:08:03,760
I went to,
you went vegan and it's been,

1469
01:08:04,120 --> 01:08:06,820
has been eight years coming up on nine 
maybe.

1470
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:11,880
Wow.
Do you ever smell like your neighbor 

1471
01:08:11,880 --> 01:08:11,880
cooking a steak and go,
yeah,

1472
01:08:11,880 --> 01:08:13,270
I mean,
you know,

1473
01:08:13,271 --> 01:08:15,000
I'm not one of those people who's like,
oh,

1474
01:08:15,010 --> 01:08:16,040
it repulses me and I

1475
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:17,280
want to throw up,
you know,

1476
01:08:17,281 --> 01:08:19,520
like I got into it for health reasons.
Right.

1477
01:08:19,590 --> 01:08:21,620
And you know,
I listened.

1478
01:08:21,650 --> 01:08:24,550
I've eaten more meat in my lifetime than
any human being ever should,

1479
01:08:24,570 --> 01:08:25,760
you know,
it's like I'm not,

1480
01:08:26,210 --> 01:08:27,560
you know,
I like it,

1481
01:08:27,590 --> 01:08:30,740
you know,
I drive by Mcdonald's or Jack in the box

1482
01:08:30,741 --> 01:08:34,160
and I smell that and that we might 
discuss some people,

1483
01:08:34,161 --> 01:08:37,160
but it triggers like this addictive 
response in me where it's like,

1484
01:08:37,161 --> 01:08:38,570
I will crave that,
you know,

1485
01:08:38,810 --> 01:08:41,900
because there's so much time has passed 
between me and eating those foods.

1486
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:47,200
I don't have that,
that sort of obsessive compulsive thing 

1487
01:08:47,200 --> 01:08:47,420
that kicks in.
Like I'm also,

1488
01:08:47,421 --> 01:08:49,340
I'm a recovering alcoholic,
like I have.

1489
01:08:49,430 --> 01:08:50,300
Um,
I'm like,

1490
01:08:50,660 --> 01:08:55,660
you know,
I can get addicted to things pretty 

1491
01:08:55,660 --> 01:08:55,660
fucking easy.
Right?

1492
01:08:55,660 --> 01:08:57,320
So that's part of my thing,
like for me to draw a lot,

1493
01:08:57,410 --> 01:08:57,830
uh,
you know,

1494
01:08:57,831 --> 01:09:02,831
kind of a line in the sand and say like,
no more is kind of the way that I have 

1495
01:09:02,831 --> 01:09:07,211
to do it right,
because otherwise it inhabits my 

1496
01:09:07,211 --> 01:09:07,211
consciousness too much.

1497
01:09:07,211 --> 01:09:09,530
But you have to put up boundaries where 
the unsurmountable boundaries,

1498
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:13,340
there are certain diets that say,
Oh,

1499
01:09:13,341 --> 01:09:14,960
you can have a cheat day.
Right?

1500
01:09:14,990 --> 01:09:19,370
So it's like if you told me that I could
have in and out burger like once a week,

1501
01:09:19,490 --> 01:09:24,490
like I would,
I would spend six days thinking about 

1502
01:09:24,490 --> 01:09:24,490
the day that I could have in and out 
burger.

1503
01:09:24,490 --> 01:09:29,141
You know what I mean?
Like in order to free myself from that 

1504
01:09:29,141 --> 01:09:30,410
prison,
I need time away.

1505
01:09:30,810 --> 01:09:31,610
Right.
So,

1506
01:09:32,030 --> 01:09:33,130
you know,
it's,

1507
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:38,200
it's really powerful with me,
whether it's a cheeseburger or a drink 

1508
01:09:38,200 --> 01:09:38,810
or a drug,
you know,

1509
01:09:38,811 --> 01:09:39,890
and that's just me,
you know,

1510
01:09:39,891 --> 01:09:42,380
it's just my experience.
But when I smelled that,

1511
01:09:42,410 --> 01:09:43,430
yeah,
triggers that thing,

1512
01:09:43,431 --> 01:09:44,060
I'm like,
oh,

1513
01:09:44,061 --> 01:09:46,340
that's good,
but if it passes quickly,

1514
01:09:46,760 --> 01:09:51,760
but if I was eating those things,
I might find myself driving into the 

1515
01:09:51,760 --> 01:09:51,760
drive through.

1516
01:09:51,760 --> 01:09:55,790
You know,
that's an issue with people that have 

1517
01:09:55,790 --> 01:09:56,860
eating disorders where the.
It's almost like the,

1518
01:09:57,100 --> 01:10:02,100
the,
the desire to have that forbidden food 

1519
01:10:02,100 --> 01:10:04,660
overwhelms their desire to be healthy.
It's like that,

1520
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:07,300
that it just becomes this thing like 
I've got,

1521
01:10:07,301 --> 01:10:09,260
I've got an itch it,
I've got an Itch,

1522
01:10:09,820 --> 01:10:11,210
itchy,
I got to scratch it.

1523
01:10:11,570 --> 01:10:13,550
I can't help it.
Yeah.

1524
01:10:13,580 --> 01:10:17,330
Transcends logic and it becomes 
psychological.

1525
01:10:17,331 --> 01:10:20,840
It becomes a psychological issue way 
more than it is a physiological issue.

1526
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:26,320
It's almost beyond psychology though,
like it's so embedded now for anybody 

1527
01:10:28,811 --> 01:10:31,610
who's truly like an addict or an 
alcoholic like it.

1528
01:10:31,720 --> 01:10:33,820
It goes to the core,
you know,

1529
01:10:33,850 --> 01:10:37,720
there is no overriding it.
When that kicks in,

1530
01:10:38,710 --> 01:10:40,120
it's just,
it's happening.

1531
01:10:40,740 --> 01:10:43,380
I had a friend who was on the Atkins 
Diet and my friend Eddie Bravo,

1532
01:10:43,450 --> 01:10:48,450
he was on the Atkins Diet and he would 
do it for six days a week and then 

1533
01:10:48,450 --> 01:10:53,150
midnight on Saturday night that mother 
fucker would go off the rails like a 

1534
01:10:53,150 --> 01:10:57,160
runaway train piloted by a meth addict.
Oh my God.

1535
01:10:57,480 --> 01:10:59,350
You.
What do you intuit for?

1536
01:10:59,430 --> 01:11:01,230
What do you intuit from that?
Right.

1537
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:03,990
Like he's building a lot of ways.
He loaded up all week.

1538
01:11:04,710 --> 01:11:07,680
So it worked though.
But why would you.

1539
01:11:08,160 --> 01:11:13,160
I'm not saying that an atkins diet is a 
healthy diet because I don't think it 

1540
01:11:13,160 --> 01:11:13,160
is,
but,

1541
01:11:13,160 --> 01:11:13,980
but what's wrong an atkins diet,
if you

1542
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:15,410
could say so from an.
Well,

1543
01:11:15,710 --> 01:11:19,400
I mean I'm not a nutritional scientists 
dots or you know,

1544
01:11:19,530 --> 01:11:24,530
I would say that that,
that I'm a diet that's super focused on 

1545
01:11:25,590 --> 01:11:30,590
basically excluding anything with any 
carbohydrates in it and eating foods 

1546
01:11:30,991 --> 01:11:34,260
that are devoid of any fiber,
which I think is really important.

1547
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:36,750
We talk about protein a lot,
but I think most people,

1548
01:11:37,050 --> 01:11:39,360
I think that conversation should really 
be about fiber,

1549
01:11:39,390 --> 01:11:44,390
like nobody's protein deficient.
I think three percent of the population 

1550
01:11:44,390 --> 01:11:47,631
has protein deficient.
Most Americans are fiber deficient 

1551
01:11:47,631 --> 01:11:47,631
though we just don't eat enough 
vegetables.

1552
01:11:47,631 --> 01:11:52,460
But as the atkins diet fiber deficient 
manner did they tell you can eat 

1553
01:11:52,460 --> 01:11:52,460
broccoli.
I think that they.

1554
01:11:52,460 --> 01:11:54,240
I think that there a,
there is a focus on,

1555
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:56,070
on meat and dairy products,
right?

1556
01:11:56,120 --> 01:11:57,990
It's like,
I mean I'm not an expert on the,

1557
01:11:58,050 --> 01:12:00,510
on the atkins diet sort of.
Yeah.

1558
01:12:00,510 --> 01:12:04,020
It's like being in Ketosis and you know,
that's a very,

1559
01:12:04,021 --> 01:12:07,020
you know,
hot button thing and you know,

1560
01:12:07,021 --> 01:12:10,650
there are people that are all about like
being in Ketosis and my understanding of

1561
01:12:10,651 --> 01:12:13,620
that is that it's kind of a crisis state
for the human body.

1562
01:12:13,621 --> 01:12:18,621
It's not a natural state of being,
it's sort of like what your body has to 

1563
01:12:18,621 --> 01:12:20,490
do when it's being deprived of other 
nutrients to be in this state.

1564
01:12:20,491 --> 01:12:23,610
Like you put these acid ketones in your 
body,

1565
01:12:23,640 --> 01:12:28,640
which then are converted to some form of
Glucose because you're so glucose 

1566
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:28,710
deprived,
right?

1567
01:12:28,740 --> 01:12:31,590
Our brains run on Glucose or bodies need
glucose.

1568
01:12:31,880 --> 01:12:33,120
You know,
if you look at,

1569
01:12:35,190 --> 01:12:36,120
look at,
you know,

1570
01:12:36,121 --> 01:12:41,121
the longest living pockets,
the pockets of civilization across the 

1571
01:12:41,121 --> 01:12:43,320
world where people live the longest and 
are the healthiest in are the happiest.

1572
01:12:43,321 --> 01:12:45,000
Like the blue zones you've heard of the 
blue zones,

1573
01:12:45,240 --> 01:12:45,570
right?

1574
01:12:45,570 --> 01:12:50,570
So Dan Buettner,
who's the guy who traveled to all of 

1575
01:12:50,570 --> 01:12:50,970
these places,
it was a friend of mine's amazing guy.

1576
01:12:51,030 --> 01:12:52,920
You should have them on the podcast.
He's amazing.

1577
01:12:52,970 --> 01:12:56,940
What's his name?
Dan Buettner be you be you e t,

1578
01:12:56,941 --> 01:13:00,720
t e n e r,
he's a national geographic fellow.

1579
01:13:01,110 --> 01:13:04,380
He's so impressive.
He's what's his,

1580
01:13:04,381 --> 01:13:05,010
uh,
his uh,

1581
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:10,040
well he's,
he's the guy who wrote the blue zones 

1582
01:13:10,040 --> 01:13:10,040
books.
So he,

1583
01:13:10,040 --> 01:13:10,040
he was,
uh,

1584
01:13:10,040 --> 01:13:13,260
like a global adventurer who set like 
three world records,

1585
01:13:13,380 --> 01:13:16,840
like cycling across the planet doing all
these crazy things and,

1586
01:13:16,841 --> 01:13:18,240
and cycling.
Well,

1587
01:13:18,241 --> 01:13:21,600
he rode his bike across Africa,
like north to south,

1588
01:13:21,601 --> 01:13:26,601
I think,
what the fuck you wrote across Russia 

1589
01:13:26,601 --> 01:13:27,840
like when this was,
when he was younger and then,

1590
01:13:27,900 --> 01:13:28,680
uh,
you know,

1591
01:13:28,710 --> 01:13:31,530
he became interested in indigenous 
populations.

1592
01:13:31,531 --> 01:13:33,480
He started working with National 
Geographic.

1593
01:13:33,481 --> 01:13:38,481
He became a writer and a,
and in his travels he became obsessed 

1594
01:13:38,491 --> 01:13:41,790
with finding places where people are the
happiest,

1595
01:13:41,850 --> 01:13:44,130
live,
the longest free of disease,

1596
01:13:44,170 --> 01:13:49,170
et Cetera.
And that ultimately became what are 

1597
01:13:49,170 --> 01:13:49,170
today known as the blue zones.
Like these,

1598
01:13:49,170 --> 01:13:52,890
like these little sort of hidden pockets
on the planet that are kind of untouched

1599
01:13:52,891 --> 01:13:56,320
from the gestalt of our modern society 
and you know,

1600
01:13:56,370 --> 01:13:59,010
they're little tiny places kind of off 
the beaten path.

1601
01:13:59,011 --> 01:13:59,320
I,
you know,

1602
01:13:59,500 --> 01:13:59,870
Eco,
the,

1603
01:13:59,880 --> 01:14:01,680
uh,
which is like an island off the coast of

1604
01:14:01,681 --> 01:14:03,480
Turkey,
Sardinia,

1605
01:14:03,630 --> 01:14:07,230
Okinawa,
and ironically Loma Linda here,

1606
01:14:07,231 --> 01:14:09,420
like not too far from here.
And so the Loma Linda,

1607
01:14:09,570 --> 01:14:10,740
which is pretty interesting.
Yeah.

1608
01:14:10,741 --> 01:14:12,010
And that's at work.
It's

1609
01:14:12,010 --> 01:14:17,010
a cultural thing because it's a 
community of seventh day adventists and 

1610
01:14:17,441 --> 01:14:22,441
it's a very strong faith based community
that also basically subsist on a plant 

1611
01:14:22,441 --> 01:14:24,910
based diet and they live in.
They live incredibly long.

1612
01:14:25,030 --> 01:14:29,560
There you go.
So the seven day adventist adventist,

1613
01:14:30,220 --> 01:14:33,680
seventh day adventist,
it's weird word.

1614
01:14:33,700 --> 01:14:34,660
They are live.
Say it.

1615
01:14:34,661 --> 01:14:39,661
Even if you're saying it correctly,
it seems like you're doing it wrong and 

1616
01:14:39,661 --> 01:14:41,850
it's a very strong faith based community
and they a based diet,

1617
01:14:42,970 --> 01:14:44,980
physical activity,
social engagement,

1618
01:14:44,981 --> 01:14:47,560
social engagement support and huge.
It's huge.

1619
01:14:47,610 --> 01:14:48,320
And,
and,

1620
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:50,110
and so,
so from,

1621
01:14:50,170 --> 01:14:55,170
from studying these cultures,
he extracted certain kind of guiding 

1622
01:14:55,170 --> 01:14:59,701
principles about how they live their 
life and one of them to get back to the 

1623
01:14:59,701 --> 01:15:01,780
question about kind of Atkins Diet is,
you know,

1624
01:15:01,781 --> 01:15:04,640
they all eat a very starchy,
um,

1625
01:15:04,710 --> 01:15:09,710
you know,
fiber rich essentially plant based diet 

1626
01:15:09,710 --> 01:15:09,710
doesn't mean they're all vegans like 
the,

1627
01:15:09,710 --> 01:15:09,790
a little bit of meat.

1628
01:15:09,790 --> 01:15:14,790
But essentially their diet is founded 
upon starchy vegetables for the most 

1629
01:15:14,790 --> 01:15:14,800
part.
And,

1630
01:15:14,801 --> 01:15:19,801
and community and accountability and 
kind of keeping your elders around and 

1631
01:15:19,801 --> 01:15:20,840
all these sorts of things have really,
you know,

1632
01:15:21,070 --> 01:15:25,390
distinguishes them as a,
you know,

1633
01:15:26,170 --> 01:15:29,170
from the way that we live our lives now,
right?

1634
01:15:29,171 --> 01:15:29,600
Like,
you know,

1635
01:15:29,640 --> 01:15:30,150
we're just,
we're,

1636
01:15:30,310 --> 01:15:32,890
we're isolated,
we're fast paced and all these sorts of,

1637
01:15:32,950 --> 01:15:37,950
you know,
kind of principles upon which we 

1638
01:15:37,950 --> 01:15:40,710
navigate our day or just very divorced 
from the way that these people are 

1639
01:15:40,710 --> 01:15:42,760
living.
I love that it says empowered women.

1640
01:15:42,820 --> 01:15:47,820
Empowered women is a factor in age.
That's,

1641
01:15:48,370 --> 01:15:50,590
that's fascinating.
I wonder what that's about.

1642
01:15:51,010 --> 01:15:53,380
A big part of it too.
I had Dan on my podcast,

1643
01:15:53,381 --> 01:15:54,670
so if people are listening,
they can,

1644
01:15:54,730 --> 01:15:56,290
they can check him out.
He was great.

1645
01:15:56,291 --> 01:15:57,200
But he,
uh,

1646
01:15:57,710 --> 01:15:59,860
a big part of it too is,
um,

1647
01:16:00,540 --> 01:16:05,540
is having purpose,
like sort of identifying early on in 

1648
01:16:05,540 --> 01:16:05,540
your life,
uh,

1649
01:16:05,540 --> 01:16:07,030
you know,
what your purpose is and,

1650
01:16:07,050 --> 01:16:08,260
and serving that purpose.

1651
01:16:08,260 --> 01:16:10,390
And these people don't retire,
you know,

1652
01:16:10,391 --> 01:16:11,860
they're just,
they're sort of,

1653
01:16:11,950 --> 01:16:16,950
you know,
living and continuing to be productive 

1654
01:16:16,950 --> 01:16:19,951
like way later in life than we're used 
to seeing enjoying your time here and 

1655
01:16:19,951 --> 01:16:24,391
that positive energy.
That's attached to enjoying your time 

1656
01:16:24,391 --> 01:16:25,420
here,
sustains your existence in a much better

1657
01:16:25,421 --> 01:16:27,070
way.
Yeah.

1658
01:16:27,071 --> 01:16:30,070
Sort of.
Sort of low grade exercise.

1659
01:16:30,071 --> 01:16:30,880
These people,
you know,

1660
01:16:30,881 --> 01:16:32,590
they're always moving,
you know,

1661
01:16:32,591 --> 01:16:34,780
they're not out running.
They're not on the treadmill,

1662
01:16:34,810 --> 01:16:39,810
but they're in their garden and they're 
walking to their friend's house and you 

1663
01:16:39,810 --> 01:16:43,951
know,
they're very engaged with their 

1664
01:16:43,951 --> 01:16:43,951
community.
They're constantly very intimate way.

1665
01:16:43,951 --> 01:16:48,660
Yeah.
Do you know I had a Aubrey de Grey on 

1666
01:16:48,660 --> 01:16:50,100
the other day who's a life extension 
scientist as a,

1667
01:16:50,520 --> 01:16:55,520
at the forefront of the various 
technologies are being developed to 

1668
01:16:55,520 --> 01:17:00,301
extend life.
He said the difference between the 

1669
01:17:00,301 --> 01:17:03,571
average and these cultures where they 
live far longer is four years.

1670
01:17:04,630 --> 01:17:08,650
That's the big goal that everybody's 
trying to attain.

1671
01:17:08,670 --> 01:17:10,100
Like live like these people that

1672
01:17:10,110 --> 01:17:13,050
live the longest and that's four years.
Four.

1673
01:17:13,140 --> 01:17:14,270
There's a four year difference,

1674
01:17:14,660 --> 01:17:15,560
right?
Well I think,

1675
01:17:15,580 --> 01:17:20,580
you know,
in these blue zones they have the 

1676
01:17:20,580 --> 01:17:20,580
highest percentage per capita of 
centenarians.

1677
01:17:20,580 --> 01:17:24,280
People living longer than 100,
but I think it's less about that age 

1678
01:17:24,280 --> 01:17:24,470
than it is about the quality of,
of your years.

1679
01:17:24,471 --> 01:17:25,120
Right.
Like,

1680
01:17:25,650 --> 01:17:26,450
you know,
listen,

1681
01:17:26,510 --> 01:17:30,360
go to the airport and look at how many 
people are in wheelchairs and you know,

1682
01:17:30,361 --> 01:17:35,361
on walkers and stuff like that.
People that are not old go to 

1683
01:17:35,361 --> 01:17:35,361
Disneyland.
Yeah,

1684
01:17:35,361 --> 01:17:35,361
it's crazy.

1685
01:17:35,361 --> 01:17:39,780
Do you ever go to Disneyland people on 
Scooters overflowing out of the side of 

1686
01:17:39,780 --> 01:17:42,930
the scooters with their legs and their 
gut and just who?

1687
01:17:43,310 --> 01:17:45,870
Oh right.
So right now in America,

1688
01:17:45,930 --> 01:17:48,720
you know,
we can split hairs over,

1689
01:17:48,721 --> 01:17:50,700
you know,
should you take fish oil or not,

1690
01:17:50,701 --> 01:17:54,240
or is it okay for you to eat the eggs 
from your chicken and your backyard?

1691
01:17:54,270 --> 01:17:58,320
But the truth is this is not the problem
that we need to be talking about.

1692
01:17:58,321 --> 01:18:02,490
We need to be talking about the fact 
that one out of every three Americans is

1693
01:18:02,491 --> 01:18:07,491
going to die of a heart attack and 70 
percent of Americans are obese or 

1694
01:18:07,491 --> 01:18:09,150
overweight and they're predicting that 
by 20,

1695
01:18:09,151 --> 01:18:14,151
30,
50 percent of Americans are going to be 

1696
01:18:14,151 --> 01:18:15,110
diabetic or prediabetic.
Just think about that is that real

1697
01:18:16,010 --> 01:18:16,820
20,
30,

1698
01:18:16,821 --> 01:18:20,990
50 percent of Americans are going to be 
diabetic or prediabetic diabetes.

1699
01:18:21,290 --> 01:18:24,290
Fucking insane.
One out of it.

1700
01:18:24,320 --> 01:18:26,990
Every three people is going to die of 
heart disease.

1701
01:18:27,680 --> 01:18:31,730
Heart disease is a lifestyle and 
foodborne illness.

1702
01:18:32,080 --> 01:18:37,080
It doesn't have to exist and we're in 
this place right now where it's sort of 

1703
01:18:37,080 --> 01:18:38,150
like some congenital verge there.
There,

1704
01:18:38,151 --> 01:18:40,540
there is for sure,
but that's not worth.

1705
01:18:40,560 --> 01:18:44,360
But if you look back through the history
of mankind,

1706
01:18:44,361 --> 01:18:49,361
there are plenty of populations that 
existed for hundreds and thousands of 

1707
01:18:49,791 --> 01:18:53,240
years without any significant incidence 
of heart disease,

1708
01:18:53,930 --> 01:18:58,930
you know,
especially in rural areas of China for 

1709
01:18:58,930 --> 01:19:03,580
long,
long years until we started exporting 

1710
01:19:03,580 --> 01:19:04,700
our diet and lifestyle overseas and now,
you know,

1711
01:19:04,730 --> 01:19:08,720
it's sort of like the latest installment
of the avengers,

1712
01:19:08,721 --> 01:19:13,721
you know,
we're sending these fast food 

1713
01:19:13,721 --> 01:19:13,721
restaurants to these places and they're 
having,

1714
01:19:13,721 --> 01:19:16,670
they're having and as the sort of 
ascension of the middle class in China,

1715
01:19:16,690 --> 01:19:21,690
you know,
continues and they can afford to 

1716
01:19:21,690 --> 01:19:22,510
purchase more meat products.
They're having a heart problem.

1717
01:19:22,530 --> 01:19:24,500
They are having disease problems that 
they've,

1718
01:19:24,630 --> 01:19:25,650
they haven't seen.
You know,

1719
01:19:25,651 --> 01:19:27,920
it's an unprecedented in the history of 
their culture.

1720
01:19:29,510 --> 01:19:34,510
So it seems also there's a real issue 
with human beings when it comes to 

1721
01:19:34,510 --> 01:19:35,960
patterns of behavior and habits that are
very,

1722
01:19:35,961 --> 01:19:38,290
very difficult to break.
And uh,

1723
01:19:38,360 --> 01:19:43,360
like as you were saying before,
like if you could have a day where you 

1724
01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:46,151
could cheat that day,
that would become the habit and then it 

1725
01:19:46,151 --> 01:19:49,361
would do.
You would be thinking about that one 

1726
01:19:49,361 --> 01:19:51,281
day.
Like it's very hard for people who are 

1727
01:19:51,281 --> 01:19:53,261
extremely obese who just their main form
of pleasure is pleasure.

1728
01:19:54,470 --> 01:19:59,470
Of course they get that wired it in 
their face and then that's what that 

1729
01:19:59,620 --> 01:20:04,620
whole fucking corndogs so good.
And that's where they're getting their 

1730
01:20:04,620 --> 01:20:06,020
pleasure from.
It's hard to deviate from that.

1731
01:20:06,021 --> 01:20:07,800
It's hard to change your patterns.
Yeah.

1732
01:20:07,930 --> 01:20:08,150
You,

1733
01:20:08,260 --> 01:20:13,260
you are managing your emotional 
wellbeing through the food choices that 

1734
01:20:13,260 --> 01:20:15,120
you're making,
that you make and they're putting on.

1735
01:20:15,880 --> 01:20:20,880
There's a great book called Salt Sugar 
Fat by this guy called Michael Morris 

1736
01:20:20,980 --> 01:20:25,980
and he kind of looks at these big food 
companies and draws an analogy to the 

1737
01:20:26,531 --> 01:20:31,531
tobacco companies in the seventies in 
the way that these companies are 

1738
01:20:31,531 --> 01:20:36,061
funneling money and research and 
marketing dollars into devising food 

1739
01:20:36,581 --> 01:20:40,990
products that are specifically designed 
to activate that pleasure center in your

1740
01:20:40,991 --> 01:20:42,100
brain.
Right?

1741
01:20:42,101 --> 01:20:43,390
So that they know,
they're like,

1742
01:20:43,391 --> 01:20:47,080
they're trying to make that food 
impossible for you to just have one.

1743
01:20:47,620 --> 01:20:51,340
And once you kind of tap into that,
that um,

1744
01:20:52,120 --> 01:20:57,120
you know,
ability to trigger that response in 

1745
01:20:57,120 --> 01:20:58,930
somebody and you create a habit out of 
that and addictive response.

1746
01:20:58,990 --> 01:21:01,720
Then you have a customer for life,
right?

1747
01:21:01,820 --> 01:21:02,440
You know,
it's like,

1748
01:21:02,470 --> 01:21:04,990
why is it so hard to eat one fucking 
chip?

1749
01:21:05,680 --> 01:21:07,780
You know,
there's a reason behind that.

1750
01:21:07,781 --> 01:21:10,100
There's something about the,
the,

1751
01:21:10,340 --> 01:21:14,710
the proportion of,
of salt and grease,

1752
01:21:14,740 --> 01:21:19,740
you know,
that will just trigger something in 

1753
01:21:19,740 --> 01:21:19,740
somebody.

1754
01:21:19,740 --> 01:21:23,530
Do know the feeling that you have when 
you do indulge in some really shitty 

1755
01:21:23,530 --> 01:21:25,470
food that you have just like,
ugh.

1756
01:21:25,650 --> 01:21:28,110
After it's over,
you feel like such a loser.

1757
01:21:30,030 --> 01:21:33,450
If I like a bag of chips,
go into a shame spiral.

1758
01:21:34,050 --> 01:21:37,980
I feel angry at myself.
Fucking dummy ate a bag of chips.

1759
01:21:37,981 --> 01:21:40,290
I never went back.
But when you're doing it,

1760
01:21:40,291 --> 01:21:42,600
you're like,
I can't even help myself.

1761
01:21:42,720 --> 01:21:43,830
It's hard.
Like a greedy,

1762
01:21:44,100 --> 01:21:45,870
greedy monster.
Like um,

1763
01:21:46,360 --> 01:21:47,310
you know what I read?
I have a,

1764
01:21:47,400 --> 01:21:50,820
I have a real weakness for those.
Uh,

1765
01:21:50,850 --> 01:21:53,460
salt,
sea salt and vinegar potato chips.

1766
01:21:53,490 --> 01:21:54,570
Oh good.
God.

1767
01:21:54,750 --> 01:21:55,800
Good.
The real thick one.

1768
01:21:55,801 --> 01:21:58,020
The kettle chip.
That's what I'm talking about.

1769
01:21:58,380 --> 01:21:59,580
Oh,
they're so good.

1770
01:21:59,850 --> 01:22:02,490
And you look at the bag and it says non 
GMO in the front.

1771
01:22:02,510 --> 01:22:03,720
You're like,
oh,

1772
01:22:06,090 --> 01:22:08,880
excellent.
I don't want to GMO potato.

1773
01:22:09,660 --> 01:22:11,520
I mean other even gmo potatoes.

1774
01:22:12,430 --> 01:22:14,850
I don't know.
I don't say those last a long time.

1775
01:22:14,851 --> 01:22:18,480
I think so we'll need to write.
Yeah.

1776
01:22:18,810 --> 01:22:21,150
Storm hadn't been heading in that 
direction though.

1777
01:22:21,360 --> 01:22:24,150
Do potato chips?
That's my guilty pleasure.

1778
01:22:24,630 --> 01:22:26,550
It's tough.
The kettle chips are tough.

1779
01:22:26,580 --> 01:22:29,700
Fucking real hard Vegan,
you know,

1780
01:22:32,030 --> 01:22:34,500
I try not to be bad.
I had a friend is Vegan.

1781
01:22:34,501 --> 01:22:35,820
He's fat as fuck.
Well,

1782
01:22:35,821 --> 01:22:40,821
it's never been easier.
It's never been easier to be an 

1783
01:22:40,821 --> 01:22:43,221
unhealthy Vegan.
I mean just walk the aisles at whole 

1784
01:22:43,221 --> 01:22:43,221
foods or Erewhon like,
you know,

1785
01:22:43,221 --> 01:22:47,120
there's so many Vegan ice creams now and
sort of meat alternatives and pasta 

1786
01:22:48,901 --> 01:22:50,520
sauces that are tasty.
Yeah.

1787
01:22:50,521 --> 01:22:54,060
And say getty is totally Vegan and you 
get it from the right place.

1788
01:22:54,220 --> 01:22:55,070
Oh,
oh yeah.

1789
01:22:55,100 --> 01:22:56,030
Without a doubt.
Yeah.

1790
01:22:56,300 --> 01:22:58,460
Yeah.
So there's plenty of options now.

1791
01:22:58,461 --> 01:23:02,070
And so just because you're Vegan,
that doesn't mean that you're,

1792
01:23:02,150 --> 01:23:04,190
you're eating a healthy diet for sure.
You know,

1793
01:23:04,310 --> 01:23:05,470
that's important.
I for

1794
01:23:05,710 --> 01:23:10,710
people understand.
And there's a lot of people also that 

1795
01:23:10,710 --> 01:23:13,541
think that drinking juice,
drinking fruit juice is really good for 

1796
01:23:13,541 --> 01:23:13,790
you.
Be careful about that folks,

1797
01:23:13,791 --> 01:23:17,720
because you're not supposed to drink 
like a court of orange juice.

1798
01:23:18,260 --> 01:23:23,260
That's not how that juice is supposed to
get to your body the way that juice is 

1799
01:23:23,260 --> 01:23:24,440
supposed to get to your bodies by eating
a fucking orange.

1800
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:25,280
Exactly.
Yeah.

1801
01:23:25,281 --> 01:23:28,130
When you drink like a pie quarter of 
pineapple juice,

1802
01:23:28,131 --> 01:23:33,131
like what?
A fucking shock of sugar to your system 

1803
01:23:33,131 --> 01:23:34,340
just because it's attached to fruit,
which we,

1804
01:23:34,341 --> 01:23:37,040
uh,
assume rightly so is healthy.

1805
01:23:37,370 --> 01:23:42,370
Just have some goddamn fruit,
drink some water while you having a big 

1806
01:23:42,370 --> 01:23:46,571
plate of pineapple and you'll be way 
better off than drinking pineapple 

1807
01:23:46,571 --> 01:23:46,571
juice.

1808
01:23:46,571 --> 01:23:47,250
Yeah.
I couldn't agree with you more.

1809
01:23:47,630 --> 01:23:49,050
You know,
we're talking about fiber.

1810
01:23:49,110 --> 01:23:51,240
It's like,
why would you remove all the fiber?

1811
01:23:51,300 --> 01:23:52,290
Yes.
On that plant.

1812
01:23:52,320 --> 01:23:54,870
Exactly.
I think juicing has its place though,

1813
01:23:54,871 --> 01:23:59,871
but there's a,
there's a huge difference between that 

1814
01:23:59,871 --> 01:24:01,740
gallon of Tropicana at the grocery store
and cold pressing,

1815
01:24:01,770 --> 01:24:06,770
you know,
some Kale and spinach with some tumeric 

1816
01:24:06,770 --> 01:24:06,770
in it

1817
01:24:06,770 --> 01:24:06,770
that's different.
You know what I mean?

1818
01:24:06,770 --> 01:24:07,580
Like I think that the sugar.
Yeah,

1819
01:24:07,890 --> 01:24:08,920
sugar is the real issue

1820
01:24:08,950 --> 01:24:10,120
you can get.
It's,

1821
01:24:10,600 --> 01:24:15,600
I look at it as medicinal and you know,
it's like if you want a really 

1822
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:17,360
concentrated dose of,
of uh,

1823
01:24:17,390 --> 01:24:20,050
you know,
micro nutrients and you know,

1824
01:24:20,110 --> 01:24:22,130
the kinds of,
um,

1825
01:24:22,240 --> 01:24:26,500
highly compacted vitamins and minerals 
that you can get in some of these foods,

1826
01:24:26,530 --> 01:24:29,560
these plants than it has its place.
But,

1827
01:24:29,890 --> 01:24:30,860
but to,
you know,

1828
01:24:30,880 --> 01:24:34,020
run 20 oranges through a juicer and 
drink that you're,

1829
01:24:34,030 --> 01:24:39,030
you're getting a huge amount of sugar in
that and you're depriving yourself of 

1830
01:24:39,030 --> 01:24:42,900
the digestive process.
And the fiber that comes with just 

1831
01:24:42,900 --> 01:24:43,750
eating the whole food,
like nature figured it out,

1832
01:24:43,751 --> 01:24:45,550
man.
Like why are you trying to,

1833
01:24:45,551 --> 01:24:50,551
you know,
just like the more you focus on eating 

1834
01:24:50,551 --> 01:24:52,030
these kinds of foods close to their 
natural state,

1835
01:24:52,031 --> 01:24:54,280
your Palette changes and you start to 
desire them.

1836
01:24:54,281 --> 01:24:56,930
Like I know these guys that are,
uh,

1837
01:24:57,130 --> 01:25:00,130
that are fruitarian like they,
all they eat is fruit like this.

1838
01:25:00,130 --> 01:25:01,450
Their whole lifestyle,
right?

1839
01:25:01,480 --> 01:25:02,580
It's called the 80 10,
10,

1840
01:25:02,890 --> 01:25:04,150
80 10,
10 diet,

1841
01:25:05,020 --> 01:25:07,780
80 percent carbs,
10 percent protein,

1842
01:25:07,781 --> 01:25:12,781
10 percent fat.
But essentially what it means is they 

1843
01:25:12,781 --> 01:25:12,940
eat fruit all day long.
That's it totally raw.

1844
01:25:13,300 --> 01:25:15,620
They'll eat like 30 bananas a day.
I've heard.

1845
01:25:16,050 --> 01:25:17,290
Right?
And so,

1846
01:25:18,010 --> 01:25:18,850
so,
you know,

1847
01:25:18,851 --> 01:25:21,610
somebody who is from that,
Atkins,

1848
01:25:21,611 --> 01:25:26,611
Ketosis,
low carb camp will tell you that that's 

1849
01:25:26,611 --> 01:25:27,040
an extremely unhealthy thing to do.
Now,

1850
01:25:27,041 --> 01:25:30,340
I'm not a fruitarian I don't have any 
direct experience with that.

1851
01:25:30,550 --> 01:25:32,950
I don't know what the longterm 
ramifications of,

1852
01:25:33,010 --> 01:25:38,010
of living that lifestyle are.
But I do know people that live this way 

1853
01:25:38,770 --> 01:25:42,970
and they're super healthy people and 
some of them are amazing athletes.

1854
01:25:42,971 --> 01:25:46,120
Like my friend Michael Arnstein,
he's fruitarian,

1855
01:25:46,121 --> 01:25:47,890
he has been forever,
uh,

1856
01:25:47,920 --> 01:25:52,660
and he was like the fifth fastest guide 
than New York City Marathon not too many

1857
01:25:52,660 --> 01:25:52,790
years ago.
Like,

1858
01:25:53,080 --> 01:25:55,780
like an elite athlete who's eating this 
way,

1859
01:25:55,890 --> 01:26:00,890
that's literally he'll,
he has to eat so much fruit that he has 

1860
01:26:00,890 --> 01:26:04,130
like two giant extra refrigerators in 
his house and he would have to drive

1861
01:26:04,190 --> 01:26:07,340
this big truck to like a fruit wholesale
or once a week.

1862
01:26:07,341 --> 01:26:12,341
And like the guy at the wholesaler 
thought that he had like a bodega or 

1863
01:26:12,341 --> 01:26:15,541
something like that because he couldn't 
believe how much fruit this guy was 

1864
01:26:15,541 --> 01:26:15,541
buying.
You know,

1865
01:26:15,541 --> 01:26:17,090
one of the UFC fighters you'd like that 
are there.

1866
01:26:17,091 --> 01:26:18,480
I believe Nate Diaz,
he's like that.

1867
01:26:18,520 --> 01:26:20,550
I think he's on the 30 bananas a day.
Yeah.

1868
01:26:20,560 --> 01:26:21,650
Yeah.
Um,

1869
01:26:21,740 --> 01:26:22,670
well,
uh,

1870
01:26:22,760 --> 01:26:24,070
but that didn't work.
He got his ass kicked.

1871
01:26:24,220 --> 01:26:25,130
I mean,
Mac,

1872
01:26:25,190 --> 01:26:27,290
Mac Dansik was playing around with it 
for awhile.

1873
01:26:28,130 --> 01:26:33,130
I don't know if he's still on it,
but people that I've talked to who have 

1874
01:26:33,130 --> 01:26:36,820
like dabbled in it say that when they're
doing it they feel amazing and his 

1875
01:26:36,820 --> 01:26:39,940
people are trim and they don't have.
They're not getting diabetes and 

1876
01:26:39,940 --> 01:26:43,301
they're,
they're getting a tremendous amount of 

1877
01:26:43,301 --> 01:26:45,011
glucose.
They're also getting a huge amount of 

1878
01:26:45,011 --> 01:26:45,260
fiber and they're still meeting their 
protein needs.

1879
01:26:45,550 --> 01:26:47,840
It's interesting.
So when I look at that,

1880
01:26:47,900 --> 01:26:52,900
it just makes me,
it gives me a different perspective on 

1881
01:26:52,900 --> 01:26:54,260
this obsession that we have with 
protein.

1882
01:26:54,261 --> 01:26:55,940
Like everyone's walking around worried 
about,

1883
01:26:56,070 --> 01:26:57,590
you know,
meeting their protein needs.

1884
01:26:57,890 --> 01:26:59,210
And the truth is,
is that,

1885
01:26:59,230 --> 01:27:04,230
you know,
the average semi sedentary person is 

1886
01:27:04,230 --> 01:27:07,070
eating two to five times the recommended
daily allowance of protein.

1887
01:27:07,071 --> 01:27:08,490
Like it's just,
it's a nonissue.

1888
01:27:08,510 --> 01:27:11,090
It's really kind of a red herring.
I should clarify that.

1889
01:27:11,091 --> 01:27:16,091
Nate Diaz was probably injured.
I think there was something wrong with 

1890
01:27:16,091 --> 01:27:16,580
him in his last fight.
So I have nothing to do with his diet.

1891
01:27:16,581 --> 01:27:18,260
I'm just fucking around.
And uh,

1892
01:27:18,261 --> 01:27:21,080
he also fought Hoffeld dose on Joe's,
which is one of the best fighters in the

1893
01:27:21,081 --> 01:27:23,450
world is the current champion.
So his diet,

1894
01:27:23,480 --> 01:27:25,070
I'm sure it had nothing to do with him 
losing,

1895
01:27:25,400 --> 01:27:30,400
but um,
is there a higher dietary requirements 

1896
01:27:30,400 --> 01:27:33,581
of protein for people that like say 
competing power lifting or things along 

1897
01:27:33,581 --> 01:27:33,581
those lines?

1898
01:27:33,581 --> 01:27:34,910
And are there any power lifters that are
Vegan?

1899
01:27:35,750 --> 01:27:39,440
There is a guy called Patrick Baboon 
Mian.

1900
01:27:39,890 --> 01:27:41,840
He's German dude,
German strong man.

1901
01:27:41,841 --> 01:27:44,840
This dude is the human wolverine.
He's insane.

1902
01:27:44,860 --> 01:27:47,660
And I had that privilege.
I made a youtube video of it.

1903
01:27:47,661 --> 01:27:49,330
Maybe you guys can pull it up.
Um,

1904
01:27:49,460 --> 01:27:51,320
I was on stage with him at,
uh,

1905
01:27:51,350 --> 01:27:56,350
an event in Toronto a couple of years 
ago where he attempted to break a 

1906
01:27:56,350 --> 01:28:00,461
Guinness Book of world record by being,
by carrying more weight than any other 

1907
01:28:00,461 --> 01:28:04,220
human being ever had.
You put 1200 pounds on a chassis that he

1908
01:28:04,221 --> 01:28:09,221
carried.
He had to carry it 10 meters and he 

1909
01:28:09,221 --> 01:28:09,440
accomplished.
It was extraordinary.

1910
01:28:09,470 --> 01:28:11,720
And the guys totally Vegan.
Wow.

1911
01:28:11,750 --> 01:28:16,750
Pulled that up.
Did Not Guide the mountain from game of 

1912
01:28:16,750 --> 01:28:16,750
thrones.
Just break that though.

1913
01:28:16,750 --> 01:28:18,920
I think he did like 1600 pounds.
Yeah.

1914
01:28:18,921 --> 01:28:19,790
He,
um,

1915
01:28:20,150 --> 01:28:21,950
he's like one of the strongest man in 
the world.

1916
01:28:21,950 --> 01:28:23,680
The guy who was the dude,
he's going to be aquaman.

1917
01:28:23,690 --> 01:28:24,500
That guy.
No,

1918
01:28:24,501 --> 01:28:24,920
no,
no.

1919
01:28:24,921 --> 01:28:29,921
He's.
He's the mountain and the game of 

1920
01:28:29,921 --> 01:28:29,921
thrones in.
He's from Iceland.

1921
01:28:29,921 --> 01:28:31,460
I'm a little bit behind or miss enormous
man.

1922
01:28:32,120 --> 01:28:37,120
There was a guy go full screen on the 
Kenya or it will fuck us up our videos.

1923
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,850
I'll fucking weird here because we do it
all for tri caster.

1924
01:28:40,880 --> 01:28:43,250
I to tell you I met one of the guys that
works at Tri caster.

1925
01:28:43,820 --> 01:28:45,530
We're hooked up.
Look at this.

1926
01:28:46,010 --> 01:28:47,370
Twelve hundred pounds.
Yeah.

1927
01:28:47,570 --> 01:28:51,080
Why does it not look at that dark that 
doesn't have 1200 DPI?

1928
01:28:51,090 --> 01:28:56,090
Definitely is.
There were all these people that are 

1929
01:28:56,090 --> 01:28:57,461
verifying it and they had all this shit 
that doesn't seem like it's 1200 pounds.

1930
01:28:57,711 --> 01:29:00,380
Why is that a.
Why does that look so light?

1931
01:29:00,830 --> 01:29:02,930
I assure you that it was.
How dare you a day.

1932
01:29:03,510 --> 01:29:04,740
That's like 50 pounds.

1933
01:29:06,270 --> 01:29:08,130
Is it?
Do you guys get graded on a scale?

1934
01:29:08,131 --> 01:29:13,131
Because he's Vegan,
like it's not really 1240 minutes 

1935
01:29:13,131 --> 01:29:13,780
talking about sounds like dog years 
Vegan.

1936
01:29:13,800 --> 01:29:16,170
Twelve hundred pounds,
which is 120 pounds.

1937
01:29:16,171 --> 01:29:17,010
Well,
he's enormous.

1938
01:29:17,040 --> 01:29:19,940
That guy's fucking giant,
so whatever it is,

1939
01:29:20,130 --> 01:29:22,380
that guy got all that muscle from being 
a Vegan.

1940
01:29:22,410 --> 01:29:23,750
Right?
Like a bull.

1941
01:29:24,110 --> 01:29:25,080
Ballsy.
Granted he,

1942
01:29:25,150 --> 01:29:27,450
he hasn't been a Vegan his entire life,
you know,

1943
01:29:27,451 --> 01:29:30,150
so it's not like he was reared that way,
but I think he's been,

1944
01:29:30,180 --> 01:29:33,870
he's been that way long enough and he 
will tell you that his strength training

1945
01:29:33,871 --> 01:29:38,871
improved and his agility and his ability
to recover a was significantly enhanced 

1946
01:29:38,871 --> 01:29:42,930
when you changed it to the mountain 
thousand year old weightlifting record.

1947
01:29:43,260 --> 01:29:47,640
He put this huge log on his back.
That guy's enormous.

1948
01:29:48,780 --> 01:29:49,630
Terrifying.
Yes.

1949
01:29:49,631 --> 01:29:51,720
At different,
a different animal,

1950
01:29:51,750 --> 01:29:56,750
especially Iceland.
There's something about Iceland 

1951
01:29:56,750 --> 01:29:57,750
diversity advice piece on Iceland,
the strong men of Iceland.

1952
01:29:58,190 --> 01:30:03,190
The vice did a whole video on it,
like apparently the people in Iceland 

1953
01:30:03,190 --> 01:30:07,161
did.
They have a long history of being like 

1954
01:30:07,161 --> 01:30:07,830
strong men competitors for whatever 
reason.

1955
01:30:08,940 --> 01:30:12,240
It was fucking giant dudes out there 
form vikings or something.

1956
01:30:12,360 --> 01:30:13,230
Yeah,
it's interesting.

1957
01:30:13,650 --> 01:30:15,420
I mean,
I think to your point,

1958
01:30:15,421 --> 01:30:18,900
and your question was,
do you think that somebody who's of that

1959
01:30:18,901 --> 01:30:23,901
ilk or you know,
like a power lifter or a strength 

1960
01:30:23,901 --> 01:30:23,901
athlete,
if their.

1961
01:30:23,901 --> 01:30:24,660
If their protein requirements are are 
higher,

1962
01:30:26,110 --> 01:30:31,110
I don't know.
I know that Patrick supplements with 

1963
01:30:31,110 --> 01:30:31,260
plant based protein powders from time to
time.

1964
01:30:32,820 --> 01:30:34,500
I don't know that you know,
he,

1965
01:30:34,530 --> 01:30:38,940
he probably is taking in somewhere 
between 80 to 100 grams a day.

1966
01:30:40,080 --> 01:30:40,780
It's not.
Yeah,

1967
01:30:40,810 --> 01:30:42,480
like pre P,
brown rice,

1968
01:30:42,481 --> 01:30:44,160
hemp protein,
hemp protein.

1969
01:30:44,161 --> 01:30:47,580
I think it's great.
I'm complete amino acid profile.

1970
01:30:47,581 --> 01:30:51,000
I mean essentially look,
it's complicated,

1971
01:30:51,001 --> 01:30:51,900
right?
It's not,

1972
01:30:52,200 --> 01:30:55,890
we can't be reductionist about it,
but in the most general sense when we're

1973
01:30:55,891 --> 01:30:58,890
talking about protein,
we're talking about amino acids,

1974
01:30:58,891 --> 01:31:03,891
right?
We're talking about the building blocks 

1975
01:31:03,891 --> 01:31:05,661
of protein and we're specifically 
talking about the nine slash amino 

1976
01:31:05,661 --> 01:31:09,531
acids,
the essential amino acids that we can't 

1977
01:31:09,531 --> 01:31:09,810
synthesize on around that we have to get
from the foods that we eat.

1978
01:31:09,900 --> 01:31:10,470
Right?
So,

1979
01:31:10,770 --> 01:31:15,770
so it's a question of making sure that 
we are ingesting those nine essential 

1980
01:31:15,770 --> 01:31:16,950
amino acids.
Right?

1981
01:31:17,160 --> 01:31:20,400
So does it matter where they come from?
In what form?

1982
01:31:20,850 --> 01:31:21,380
You know,
they,

1983
01:31:21,381 --> 01:31:26,381
they are delivered to your body.
Does it matter if it's in hemp or if 

1984
01:31:26,381 --> 01:31:26,381
it's in steak?

1985
01:31:28,810 --> 01:31:29,320
We don't.
No,

1986
01:31:29,380 --> 01:31:29,980
we don't.
Yeah,

1987
01:31:29,981 --> 01:31:31,780
we don't know.
All I can tell you is that,

1988
01:31:32,240 --> 01:31:34,210
you know,
I seem to be doing okay with it,

1989
01:31:34,540 --> 01:31:39,540
so,
and I can just share my experience with 

1990
01:31:39,540 --> 01:31:39,540
it.
That's all.

1991
01:31:39,540 --> 01:31:39,600
Yeah.
There's um,

1992
01:31:39,700 --> 01:31:44,700
there was an issue,
or Travis Barker was in that plane 

1993
01:31:44,700 --> 01:31:44,700
crash.
Do you know that story?

1994
01:31:44,700 --> 01:31:45,100
Barker,
the drummer?

1995
01:31:45,160 --> 01:31:46,510
Yeah,
I,

1996
01:31:46,840 --> 01:31:49,930
I've seen the juicy ladies all the time.
He's in the neighborhood.

1997
01:31:50,170 --> 01:31:50,920
He,
uh,

1998
01:31:51,130 --> 01:31:56,130
he was in a plane crash and had to get 
skin grafts and got off of his Vegan 

1999
01:31:57,190 --> 01:32:02,190
Diet because of that,
like he having a hard time healing and 

2000
01:32:02,190 --> 01:32:02,710
the starting to me and he healed much 
quicker.

2001
01:32:03,250 --> 01:32:03,920
Yeah.
I don't know.

2002
01:32:03,921 --> 01:32:05,800
I hadn't heard that.
Um,

2003
01:32:06,100 --> 01:32:08,230
but that's pretty sure.
He's pretty sure he's,

2004
01:32:08,290 --> 01:32:09,040
you know,
he's,

2005
01:32:09,130 --> 01:32:10,900
he's,
he's pretty hardcore Vegan.

2006
01:32:11,350 --> 01:32:13,600
He's partner in that restaurant 
crossroads.

2007
01:32:13,601 --> 01:32:14,440
Have you been a crossroads?

2008
01:32:14,620 --> 01:32:18,790
Where does that phenomenal restaurant 
restaurants and it's in Hollywood.

2009
01:32:18,791 --> 01:32:21,310
Yeah,
but it's Tal Ronen who's the chef.

2010
01:32:21,311 --> 01:32:26,311
There is a mastermind.
He's a genius in the food is 

2011
01:32:26,311 --> 01:32:26,311
extraordinary.
You should check it out.

2012
01:32:26,311 --> 01:32:26,940
Okay.
I'm,

2013
01:32:27,020 --> 01:32:28,930
I'm,
I'm just stating what I heard,

2014
01:32:29,300 --> 01:32:34,300
what I read.
I don't know about him after the 

2015
01:32:34,300 --> 01:32:34,300
accident.
I hadn't heard that.

2016
01:32:34,300 --> 01:32:36,230
Is there any properties that would exist
in,

2017
01:32:36,231 --> 01:32:41,231
in flesh and blood and eating meat that 
would somehow or another benefit you 

2018
01:32:41,231 --> 01:32:43,180
recovering from an injury?
Does that make sense?

2019
01:32:43,690 --> 01:32:44,410
Yeah.
I don't,

2020
01:32:44,411 --> 01:32:46,180
uh,
you know,

2021
01:32:46,181 --> 01:32:48,280
that,
that would expedite that process.

2022
01:32:48,700 --> 01:32:53,700
I mean there are,
there's a difference between the way I 

2023
01:32:53,700 --> 01:32:56,641
feel when I eat like wild game versus 
the way I feel when I eat steak that's 

2024
01:32:57,581 --> 01:33:00,520
like raised factory rails,
steak or whatever.

2025
01:33:01,300 --> 01:33:03,700
There's a difference in the way your 
body reacts to it.

2026
01:33:04,220 --> 01:33:05,350
Your body has a,
there's a,

2027
01:33:05,351 --> 01:33:06,430
there's a feeling that you eat.

2028
01:33:06,430 --> 01:33:11,430
Especially Moose.
Moose is very unusual for whatever 

2029
01:33:11,430 --> 01:33:11,680
reason.
When you eat moose you get this,

2030
01:33:11,681 --> 01:33:13,720
like you almost feel like it's a 
stimulant.

2031
01:33:13,750 --> 01:33:16,390
It's very strange.
Like when you eat rare,

2032
01:33:16,820 --> 01:33:17,710
cause heat,
it rare.

2033
01:33:17,711 --> 01:33:21,550
It's a very lean and there was this 
weird like woo,

2034
01:33:21,580 --> 01:33:26,580
like you get a charge after it.
Very similar to what I get when I eat 

2035
01:33:26,580 --> 01:33:31,171
kale shakes when I,
when I Kale shake some of the things 

2036
01:33:31,171 --> 01:33:32,200
that I tell people.
If you want to change your diet,

2037
01:33:32,260 --> 01:33:35,470
like here's one of the best ways to eat 
something healthy,

2038
01:33:35,471 --> 01:33:37,690
get a positive reaction from that,
you want to repeat it,

2039
01:33:37,960 --> 01:33:42,960
and one of the best positive reactions 
I've ever gotten is I drink these Kale 

2040
01:33:42,960 --> 01:33:45,010
shakes in the morning.
I called them hoke loads,

2041
01:33:45,011 --> 01:33:48,730
so I talk about all the time it's Kale,
cucumber,

2042
01:33:48,790 --> 01:33:52,540
celery,
a large chunk of ginger,

2043
01:33:52,600 --> 01:33:55,900
a four cloves of garlic,
coconut oil,

2044
01:33:56,020 --> 01:34:01,020
and an apple blend that sucker up 
together and there is a nutrient blast 

2045
01:34:01,421 --> 01:34:03,370
that you get in there that it's a 
tangible,

2046
01:34:03,860 --> 01:34:06,530
a stimulant,
sort of a feeling like I get,

2047
01:34:06,560 --> 01:34:07,990
I feel stimulant.

2048
01:34:08,620 --> 01:34:09,670
Yeah,
that'll get it done.

2049
01:34:09,730 --> 01:34:10,510
Right?
And,

2050
01:34:10,540 --> 01:34:12,700
and that's what I say to people all the 
time.

2051
01:34:12,701 --> 01:34:14,080
They're like,
I'm like,

2052
01:34:14,081 --> 01:34:19,081
look man,
don't worry about whether you're gonna 

2053
01:34:19,081 --> 01:34:20,050
do this all the way or what you're going
to do tomorrow.

2054
01:34:20,080 --> 01:34:25,080
Just like wake up and drink that salad 
for breakfast and make that connection 

2055
01:34:25,080 --> 01:34:28,630
with how you feel because truly nothing 
will make you feel better in the morning

2056
01:34:28,930 --> 01:34:33,310
than drinking a super nutrient dense 
green shake.

2057
01:34:33,720 --> 01:34:34,500
It's just,
you know,

2058
01:34:34,510 --> 01:34:36,160
I mean,
whether it has,

2059
01:34:36,161 --> 01:34:37,930
you know,
you can have variations on a theme,

2060
01:34:37,931 --> 01:34:42,931
like I do something similar,
it's a little bit different and it's 

2061
01:34:42,931 --> 01:34:42,931
never the same,
you know,

2062
01:34:42,931 --> 01:34:42,931
I changed it from day to day or 
whatever,

2063
01:34:42,931 --> 01:34:45,460
but once you make that connection and 
you're like,

2064
01:34:45,490 --> 01:34:46,930
Oh wow,
you know,

2065
01:34:46,931 --> 01:34:50,740
then that starts to change the microbial
ecology in your gut.

2066
01:34:51,310 --> 01:34:52,930
Yeah,
that's interesting,

2067
01:34:52,931 --> 01:34:53,200
isn't it?

2068
01:34:53,200 --> 01:34:53,950
And the,
and the,

2069
01:34:54,160 --> 01:34:55,960
and I think we talked about this last 
time too,

2070
01:34:55,961 --> 01:35:00,961
like all these studies that are coming 
out about how important your microbiome 

2071
01:35:00,961 --> 01:35:04,880
is to all kinds of things that impact 
your health and,

2072
01:35:04,910 --> 01:35:09,910
and how and how there's some evidence to
suggest that the quality of your gut 

2073
01:35:10,680 --> 01:35:11,860
biome,
uh,

2074
01:35:12,020 --> 01:35:14,000
can impact your cravings.
Right?

2075
01:35:14,010 --> 01:35:14,780
Oh,
for sure.

2076
01:35:14,790 --> 01:35:16,310
So sugar,
when you have,

2077
01:35:16,420 --> 01:35:18,500
that's a real issue with sugar.
So when people say,

2078
01:35:18,501 --> 01:35:19,580
well,
I just crave this,

2079
01:35:19,581 --> 01:35:21,380
you know,
my body's telling me that I need it.

2080
01:35:21,410 --> 01:35:24,050
Well that's not an objective analysis,
right?

2081
01:35:24,051 --> 01:35:29,051
Just because you crave something that 
doesn't mean that your body needs it in 

2082
01:35:29,051 --> 01:35:29,970
my own interview.
Maybe it does,

2083
01:35:31,080 --> 01:35:31,970
but if I.
yeah,

2084
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,880
exactly right.
So how do you discern between the two?

2085
01:35:35,300 --> 01:35:36,710
Yeah,
that's an interesting point.

2086
01:35:37,050 --> 01:35:37,610
Um,
would,

2087
01:35:37,611 --> 01:35:42,611
that's absolutely a fact when it comes 
to a gut microbes when it comes to 

2088
01:35:42,611 --> 01:35:45,170
sugar,
that if you feed those microbes a lot of

2089
01:35:45,171 --> 01:35:50,171
sugar,
they become dependent upon it and they 

2090
01:35:50,171 --> 01:35:50,171
need it to survive.

2091
01:35:50,171 --> 01:35:50,410
And so they're impulsing you,
I need more of that.

2092
01:35:51,320 --> 01:35:56,320
Then you're in this cycle.
So they analyze the gut biome of people 

2093
01:35:56,320 --> 01:35:57,920
that are like Chocoholics,
right?

2094
01:35:57,921 --> 01:36:01,010
And it was very different from people 
that are ambivalent about chocolate.

2095
01:36:01,550 --> 01:36:05,390
That's such a bizarre thing that you 
could have these organisms living inside

2096
01:36:05,391 --> 01:36:10,150
your intestinal track that are actually 
changing the way you crave things.

2097
01:36:10,151 --> 01:36:15,151
So they're sending some sort of stimulus
that gets to your brain and it's 

2098
01:36:15,151 --> 01:36:16,330
altering the way you,
you,

2099
01:36:16,350 --> 01:36:18,770
you,
you want food in your body.

2100
01:36:18,830 --> 01:36:23,830
Well,
it's an assault to your idea that you 

2101
01:36:23,830 --> 01:36:24,200
are essentially human being who is in 
control of your thoughts.

2102
01:36:24,230 --> 01:36:28,650
And then that leads to the question of 
higher consciousness versus you know,

2103
01:36:28,651 --> 01:36:30,230
the sort of looping,
you know,

2104
01:36:30,231 --> 01:36:34,490
kind of a thing that your brain can do,
right?

2105
01:36:34,491 --> 01:36:35,820
Like what does that mean?
You know,

2106
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:40,130
when you observe your own thoughts,
what is it that your who's The observer,

2107
01:36:40,190 --> 01:36:41,640
but you know what I mean,
like,

2108
01:36:41,750 --> 01:36:46,750
so you know what I mean?

2109
01:36:48,980 --> 01:36:52,580
Like if you're having a dream and you're
having a conversation with somebody in a

2110
01:36:52,581 --> 01:36:55,250
dream and you're surprised at what 
somebody tells you,

2111
01:36:56,060 --> 01:36:57,830
but you're imagining that,
right?

2112
01:36:58,220 --> 01:37:01,130
Right.
So because you didn't know in your dream

2113
01:37:01,131 --> 01:37:02,990
that that person was going to say that 
thing to you,

2114
01:37:03,020 --> 01:37:05,180
but on some level obviously you did.
Well,

2115
01:37:05,181 --> 01:37:08,840
that's the complex nuances of Caruso for
sure.

2116
01:37:08,930 --> 01:37:13,930
And,
and the complex nuances of just 

2117
01:37:13,930 --> 01:37:13,930
consciousness,
you know?

2118
01:37:14,420 --> 01:37:17,120
Yeah.
The idea that there could be microbes in

2119
01:37:17,121 --> 01:37:21,050
your body that are stimulating and 
changing the way your brain functions is

2120
01:37:21,051 --> 01:37:23,460
so that,
that seems so alien to people because we

2121
01:37:23,461 --> 01:37:25,460
like to think of ourselves as 
autonomous.

2122
01:37:25,640 --> 01:37:26,600
Right.
But we're not,

2123
01:37:26,601 --> 01:37:27,100
we,
we're,

2124
01:37:27,190 --> 01:37:30,050
we're far more microbes than human 
whamming the percentage.

2125
01:37:30,051 --> 01:37:31,700
I don't know.
I can't remember what the percentage is,

2126
01:37:31,701 --> 01:37:32,750
but it's ridiculous.
Like,

2127
01:37:32,900 --> 01:37:34,100
like the,
the number of,

2128
01:37:34,130 --> 01:37:38,570
of microorganisms like trumps the number
of cells you have in your body by like a

2129
01:37:38,571 --> 01:37:39,590
factor of,
you know,

2130
01:37:39,910 --> 01:37:44,910
some,
I don't know if it's 10 or something 

2131
01:37:44,910 --> 01:37:46,661
crazy where there's more eco lie living 
in your gut than there have ever been 

2132
01:37:46,661 --> 01:37:48,300
people ever.
That's,

2133
01:37:48,710 --> 01:37:50,240
that's real.
Those are real numbers.

2134
01:37:50,780 --> 01:37:51,950
There's also,
it's not,

2135
01:37:51,980 --> 01:37:53,120
it's not.
You know,

2136
01:37:53,121 --> 01:37:56,010
you have to have a healthy symbiotic 
relationship with

2137
01:37:56,010 --> 01:37:56,610
this,
right?

2138
01:37:56,640 --> 01:37:59,010
Like you need it to live.
It's part of being healthy.

2139
01:37:59,190 --> 01:38:00,570
Yeah.
We've talked about this,

2140
01:38:00,571 --> 01:38:05,571
I believe last time,
various forms of probiotics that you 

2141
01:38:05,571 --> 01:38:05,571
engage in.
Sauerkraut,

2142
01:38:05,630 --> 01:38:07,470
I think you said one of them.
Kimchi,

2143
01:38:07,500 --> 01:38:08,580
Kimchi.
I love Kimchi.

2144
01:38:08,610 --> 01:38:10,290
Kimchi is great.
Love that stuff.

2145
01:38:10,540 --> 01:38:12,040
Come up.
My wife fucking hates it.

2146
01:38:12,480 --> 01:38:14,040
Says it makes me smell tough.
Shit.

2147
01:38:14,070 --> 01:38:15,150
Yeah.
Kombucha.

2148
01:38:15,360 --> 01:38:17,130
I love that stuff too.
But you know,

2149
01:38:17,131 --> 01:38:19,100
it pisses me off man.
They fucking.

2150
01:38:19,430 --> 01:38:24,000
That a gts Kombucha had to pull the,
the really good stuff and put that water

2151
01:38:24,001 --> 01:38:27,990
down horseshit because it's more than 
one half of one percent alcohol.

2152
01:38:28,140 --> 01:38:32,730
The fermentation process.
Microbes tiny trace of fermentation that

2153
01:38:32,940 --> 01:38:37,940
like left a little bit of alcohol in it 
that caused this whole thing and they 

2154
01:38:37,940 --> 01:38:37,940
had to pull it.
They had to pull everything.

2155
01:38:37,940 --> 01:38:40,410
We started a state.
We started making our own.

2156
01:38:40,500 --> 01:38:43,530
Have you ever made your own gas?
I did it just so you have the big scoby.

2157
01:38:43,650 --> 01:38:46,440
I've been in a Kombucha drinker since 
94.

2158
01:38:47,050 --> 01:38:51,480
When I started drinking it,
I'm Andy Dick turned me onto it and Andy

2159
01:38:51,480 --> 01:38:54,870
Dick gave me a fucking,
a slab of Kombucha,

2160
01:38:54,920 --> 01:38:59,920
a fungus to take home.
And I got a bowl and I started brewing 

2161
01:38:59,920 --> 01:39:04,341
it in my refrigerator and a man.
Oh Oj that was long before.

2162
01:39:04,471 --> 01:39:06,240
And you know,
gts or anybody.

2163
01:39:06,730 --> 01:39:07,590
Oh,
you couldn't buy it.

2164
01:39:07,740 --> 01:39:08,650
I used to,
uh,

2165
01:39:08,700 --> 01:39:13,700
I used to have a bowl,
like a huge salad bowl in my frigerator 

2166
01:39:13,700 --> 01:39:16,590
with a fucking living fungus in it.
And I would have the Saran wrap on it.

2167
01:39:16,591 --> 01:39:21,591
There was sugar and stuff in the bowl.
I forget what was the ingredients were 

2168
01:39:21,591 --> 01:39:25,130
and it would feed off of that and I 
would leave it in there for a certain 

2169
01:39:25,130 --> 01:39:25,130
amount of time and then pour it into a 
glass and drink it.

2170
01:39:25,130 --> 01:39:29,330
It's great,
but it was too much of a pain in the 

2171
01:39:29,330 --> 01:39:31,251
ass.
And then I'm somewhere in the late 

2172
01:39:31,251 --> 01:39:34,851
nineties.
I started finding it in stores and then 

2173
01:39:34,851 --> 01:39:36,130
I got into it.
But now I have a bunch here.

2174
01:39:36,140 --> 01:39:37,050
It's everywhere.
I don't,

2175
01:39:37,051 --> 01:39:38,310
I don't go.
I mean,

2176
01:39:38,340 --> 01:39:41,910
I drink it every day and when I go on 
the road,

2177
01:39:42,230 --> 01:39:47,230
um,
most of the times I'll find a whole 

2178
01:39:47,230 --> 01:39:49,631
foods and uh,
I'll stock up on it and leave it in my 

2179
01:39:49,631 --> 01:39:49,860
hotel room.
I think it's probiotics or.

2180
01:39:49,861 --> 01:39:52,680
So I,
I'm very rarely sick.

2181
01:39:52,710 --> 01:39:57,710
I mean very rarely and I travel a lot 
and one of the things that I attribute 

2182
01:39:57,710 --> 01:40:00,300
that to is probiotics.
I think that you really,

2183
01:40:00,600 --> 01:40:05,600
it's one of the unsung heroes of the 
immune system that people don't take 

2184
01:40:05,600 --> 01:40:09,090
into consideration the symbiotic 
relationship that we have with all these

2185
01:40:09,091 --> 01:40:11,430
weird microorganisms that you ingest.

2186
01:40:12,020 --> 01:40:17,020
And the more of those you have,
the less deficits you have a in terms of

2187
01:40:17,881 --> 01:40:22,881
your nutritional intake and the more I'm
more positive microbes and positive bio 

2188
01:40:24,090 --> 01:40:29,090
organisms that you take into your body,
the more you're going to have the whole 

2189
01:40:29,090 --> 01:40:30,660
system is going to function better and 
be able to fight off immune or fight off

2190
01:40:31,050 --> 01:40:31,980
disease better.
Yeah,

2191
01:40:31,981 --> 01:40:34,320
for sure.
The example that I always give,

2192
01:40:34,470 --> 01:40:36,660
I think I might've shared this last 
time,

2193
01:40:36,661 --> 01:40:41,661
I'm not sure if we did.
It was the last time was a long time 

2194
01:40:41,661 --> 01:40:41,661
ago.
Probably nobody saw that anyway,

2195
01:40:41,661 --> 01:40:41,670
but,
um,

2196
01:40:41,790 --> 01:40:43,470
the example that I always give is,
uh,

2197
01:40:43,560 --> 01:40:46,890
is from supersize me,
the Morgan spurlock documentary where he

2198
01:40:46,891 --> 01:40:49,410
decides he's going to eat Mcdonald's for
30 days straight.

2199
01:40:50,220 --> 01:40:52,360
And for people that saw the movie,
um,

2200
01:40:52,440 --> 01:40:53,990
you might remember that,
you know,

2201
01:40:54,010 --> 01:40:56,680
a couple of days in,
into this experiment,

2202
01:40:57,260 --> 01:40:58,000
you know,
he just,

2203
01:40:58,060 --> 01:41:00,430
he can't imagine how he's going to make 
it through 30 days.

2204
01:41:00,950 --> 01:41:05,950
And there's that scene where he's in the
car and he actually vomited out the 

2205
01:41:05,950 --> 01:41:06,250
window after he drinks a milkshake or 
something like that.

2206
01:41:06,251 --> 01:41:07,540
And you just like,
this is the worst.

2207
01:41:08,440 --> 01:41:13,440
And then,
and then fast forward like two weeks 

2208
01:41:13,440 --> 01:41:15,511
later and there's a scene where he's 
like waking up in the morning and he's 

2209
01:41:15,511 --> 01:41:15,630
like,
oh,

2210
01:41:15,670 --> 01:41:17,530
I feel so sick.
He's like,

2211
01:41:17,531 --> 01:41:19,300
I feel terrible.
He's like,

2212
01:41:19,390 --> 01:41:21,130
let's go to Mcdonald's,
you know,

2213
01:41:21,131 --> 01:41:23,500
for his breakfast.
And then he eats,

2214
01:41:23,560 --> 01:41:26,740
he eats his whatever he ate for 
breakfast at Mcdonald's that morning.

2215
01:41:26,800 --> 01:41:28,900
And like,
he walks out and he's like,

2216
01:41:28,990 --> 01:41:30,760
I feel awesome.
You know,

2217
01:41:30,761 --> 01:41:35,140
like he had to get,
like he had to get his fix.

2218
01:41:35,470 --> 01:41:37,600
And so,
you know,

2219
01:41:37,630 --> 01:41:41,680
what I see in that is somebody whose 
microbiome has adjusted,

2220
01:41:42,130 --> 01:41:46,690
he has replaced because at the time his 
girlfriend,

2221
01:41:46,800 --> 01:41:48,310
uh,
was a Vegan chef,

2222
01:41:48,311 --> 01:41:53,311
right?
So he was coming off of eating 

2223
01:41:53,311 --> 01:41:53,500
essentially a plant based diet.
It goes into this Mcdonald's thing.

2224
01:41:53,920 --> 01:41:58,780
And by virtue of bombarding his system 
with Mcdonald's food,

2225
01:41:59,090 --> 01:42:00,870
uh,
he reap,

2226
01:42:01,060 --> 01:42:06,060
he repopulates his gut biome with the 
kind of micro organisms that feed off 

2227
01:42:06,221 --> 01:42:07,510
Mcdonald's food,
right?

2228
01:42:07,511 --> 01:42:08,770
So suddenly,
you know,

2229
01:42:08,771 --> 01:42:10,870
because those microorganisms are on the 
food that you're eating,

2230
01:42:10,871 --> 01:42:15,871
right?
And then they feed into your gut and 

2231
01:42:15,871 --> 01:42:17,521
then they start to propagate and 
suddenly he's craving these foods that 

2232
01:42:17,521 --> 01:42:21,900
were making him sick two weeks earlier 
that he couldn't imagine continuing to 

2233
01:42:21,900 --> 01:42:21,900
eat.

2234
01:42:21,900 --> 01:42:26,400
That's the weirdest thing about died is 
you're essentially creating a 

2235
01:42:26,400 --> 01:42:29,920
civilization in your body and the trip.
It really is.

2236
01:42:30,400 --> 01:42:31,180
It really.
I mean you're,

2237
01:42:31,181 --> 01:42:32,620
you are,
you're,

2238
01:42:32,740 --> 01:42:35,620
you're a super organism.
You are a container

2239
01:42:35,630 --> 01:42:38,150
and human beings are the microbiome of 
the planet,

2240
01:42:38,850 --> 01:42:39,700
right?
Yeah.

2241
01:42:40,270 --> 01:42:44,590
Yeah.
I mean that's a good sign that our earth

2242
01:42:44,591 --> 01:42:46,030
is sick when you check out.

2243
01:42:46,370 --> 01:42:49,810
Sure.
An unhealthy gut bacteria for the planet

2244
01:42:49,910 --> 01:42:52,070
in a lot of ways.
I mean really is.

2245
01:42:52,071 --> 01:42:57,071
It's almost like,
it's almost like everything behaves in 

2246
01:42:57,071 --> 01:42:59,360
this sort of fractal manner where you 
know,

2247
01:42:59,370 --> 01:43:03,750
the bigger you get like a main and the 
earth itself is probably,

2248
01:43:03,751 --> 01:43:08,751
you know,
a microbe in the greater sense of the 

2249
01:43:08,751 --> 01:43:11,381
galaxy,
which is a micro and a greater sense of 

2250
01:43:11,381 --> 01:43:14,171
the universe.
And it's all sort of connected in some 

2251
01:43:14,171 --> 01:43:16,781
weird way.
And that the lower you get down to gut 

2252
01:43:16,781 --> 01:43:20,111
microbes and how you fuel those gut 
microbes and how it impacts the health 

2253
01:43:20,510 --> 01:43:24,980
of the actual super organism itself.
The human being as a really fascinating.

2254
01:43:25,340 --> 01:43:26,540
It really is.
It really is.

2255
01:43:26,541 --> 01:43:31,541
When you stop and think about it,
because very few people think of 

2256
01:43:31,541 --> 01:43:33,350
themselves as being a host for life.
Like I am just this.

2257
01:43:33,590 --> 01:43:35,990
I'm just trying to keep my garden 
healthy.

2258
01:43:36,170 --> 01:43:38,450
You know the garden of my body,
which is filled.

2259
01:43:38,470 --> 01:43:39,170
No,
you think of it.

2260
01:43:39,171 --> 01:43:41,810
I am rich roll.
I am this one.

2261
01:43:41,960 --> 01:43:43,490
I am the one.
I am one.

2262
01:43:43,700 --> 01:43:45,320
I am one thing,
but you're not.

2263
01:43:45,321 --> 01:43:50,321
No one is one thing,
but the brain thinks it's one thing 

2264
01:43:50,321 --> 01:43:51,110
which is a fucker man.
What a weird.

2265
01:43:51,380 --> 01:43:53,630
That your brain doesn't realize,
hey,

2266
01:43:53,980 --> 01:43:54,610
you know,
I'm,

2267
01:43:55,040 --> 01:44:00,040
I'm getting all these signals to eat 
Mcdonald's because I've got all these 

2268
01:44:00,040 --> 01:44:03,671
weird asshole Mcdonald's bacteria living
in my gut and what I need to do,

2269
01:44:03,801 --> 01:44:08,801
I need to get some cucumber bacteria 
down in there to fuck with the 

2270
01:44:08,801 --> 01:44:10,520
McDonald's bacteria.
It's a very.

2271
01:44:10,521 --> 01:44:15,521
It's a very fascinating thing to be a 
human being and to be completely 

2272
01:44:15,521 --> 01:44:19,421
disconnected from that reality without 
externally taking it in,

2273
01:44:20,021 --> 01:44:25,021
in the form of education and knowledge 
and then having to internalize it,

2274
01:44:25,070 --> 01:44:26,630
having to think about and go,
okay,

2275
01:44:26,930 --> 01:44:30,320
I need to take into consideration that I
am not just a one,

2276
01:44:30,590 --> 01:44:35,590
I am a container for all these different
organisms and the the amount of positive

2277
01:44:37,160 --> 01:44:41,330
organisms will directly affect the way 
the brain works.

2278
01:44:42,140 --> 01:44:44,720
Fuck,
that's hard to think,

2279
01:44:44,721 --> 01:44:45,620
man.
That's hard to.

2280
01:44:45,650 --> 01:44:46,760
Hard to wrap your head around.

2281
01:44:48,400 --> 01:44:52,570
Then factor in the emotional override 
that takes over,

2282
01:44:53,260 --> 01:44:57,490
that compels you to take an action 
irrespective of the logical choice after

2283
01:44:57,491 --> 01:45:01,150
you've been educated.
I think that's equally as powerful,

2284
01:45:01,151 --> 01:45:02,230
if not more powerful.

2285
01:45:02,530 --> 01:45:03,050
Yeah,
all.

2286
01:45:03,610 --> 01:45:08,290
Oftentimes that can be adjust.
All that can be adjusted with momentum.

2287
01:45:08,560 --> 01:45:13,560
If you can just just fucking force 
yourself into a pattern that's more 

2288
01:45:13,841 --> 01:45:15,730
positive.
Just somehow or another say,

2289
01:45:15,731 --> 01:45:16,690
okay.
You know,

2290
01:45:16,691 --> 01:45:21,691
like some people say,
I'm going to start training for a 

2291
01:45:21,691 --> 01:45:24,061
marathon.
I'm going to start on Monday and Monday 

2292
01:45:24,061 --> 01:45:24,640
I'm gonna run two miles and then you 
know,

2293
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:30,000
we're gonna be on the system of recovery
and this is what I'm going to do and 

2294
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:31,600
you're going to go into training.
I'm going to start a training camp.

2295
01:45:31,601 --> 01:45:34,510
It's all written down and if you can do 
that,

2296
01:45:34,570 --> 01:45:39,570
if you could do that with your diet,
I can't tell you how many people have 

2297
01:45:39,570 --> 01:45:44,010
come up to me and said I have lost a 
tremendous amount of weight since listen

2298
01:45:44,020 --> 01:45:47,050
to your podcasts because I started 
incorporating Kale shakes into my diet.

2299
01:45:47,230 --> 01:45:50,980
That's my primary breakfast is a Kale 
shake and it changed everything.

2300
01:45:51,130 --> 01:45:54,460
I mean I'm talking about hundreds.
It's almost like a joke.

2301
01:45:54,640 --> 01:45:56,110
Like I run into people and go,
dude,

2302
01:45:56,111 --> 01:45:58,010
I lost 100 pounds from your pocket.
Okay.

2303
01:45:58,070 --> 01:45:59,640
Another guy.
It's almost like a job.

2304
01:45:59,680 --> 01:46:02,160
Like,
I mean you tweeted out that I was coming

2305
01:46:02,161 --> 01:46:07,161
on the podcast and there's like 50 
comments after that about hulk loads all

2306
01:46:07,620 --> 01:46:09,120
about the hulk load.
Well,

2307
01:46:09,121 --> 01:46:11,220
I added beats to the whole clothes 
because of you.

2308
01:46:12,020 --> 01:46:13,060
You recommended.
Yeah.

2309
01:46:13,490 --> 01:46:15,120
Beats will get you out of bed in the 
morning.

2310
01:46:15,140 --> 01:46:20,140
He eats are fantastic.
That's the ultimate like preworkout 

2311
01:46:20,140 --> 01:46:23,960
boost.
What a nutrient rich plant that is a 

2312
01:46:23,960 --> 01:46:23,960
root does.
They're amazing.

2313
01:46:23,960 --> 01:46:24,660
Just like the first time you do it 
though,

2314
01:46:24,661 --> 01:46:26,850
don't freak out the first time you take 
a dump.

2315
01:46:27,710 --> 01:46:32,470
All bloody red beets.
Yeah,

2316
01:46:32,471 --> 01:46:33,270
I know.
It's crazy.

2317
01:46:33,271 --> 01:46:35,670
It's actually done.
You go to the store and you get,

2318
01:46:35,700 --> 01:46:40,700
you get the beats right and you put them
on the thing and like unless you say 

2319
01:46:40,700 --> 01:46:42,450
otherwise they are going to cut the,
the beet Greens off and throw them away.

2320
01:46:42,930 --> 01:46:44,190
That's the good stuff,
man.

2321
01:46:44,400 --> 01:46:45,650
That's also good as well.

2322
01:46:45,770 --> 01:46:47,570
Well yeah,
it's definitely good as well.

2323
01:46:47,571 --> 01:46:49,680
I mean I don't know why people don't 
think that's edible.

2324
01:46:49,681 --> 01:46:50,340
Isn't that strange?

2325
01:46:50,610 --> 01:46:55,020
So we just have this idea that we were 
very rigid and like our idea,

2326
01:46:55,021 --> 01:46:56,940
like what you eat,
what you don't eat like that,

2327
01:46:57,200 --> 01:46:58,620
just throw that out,
chop that off.

2328
01:46:58,640 --> 01:47:03,640
A beet.
Greens are awesome and they don't taste 

2329
01:47:03,640 --> 01:47:03,640
bad.
It's not like it's a,

2330
01:47:03,640 --> 01:47:04,140
it's weird.
You don't,

2331
01:47:04,170 --> 01:47:07,160
you never see a beat green salad.
That's not,

2332
01:47:07,700 --> 01:47:09,540
that's not common to at our house.
Joe Rogan.

2333
01:47:09,580 --> 01:47:11,760
Whoa.
Richard called me out.

2334
01:47:12,200 --> 01:47:13,230
Um,
what are,

2335
01:47:13,280 --> 01:47:15,870
what are some other like,
here's a funny thing on.

2336
01:47:15,871 --> 01:47:20,340
I fucking saw the other data foods.
Bok Choy is the new Kale,

2337
01:47:21,150 --> 01:47:22,500
Bok Choy.
You Fox.

2338
01:47:22,860 --> 01:47:25,170
That's good too.
It's not just the new Kale.

2339
01:47:25,980 --> 01:47:28,200
What is that?
Why do people have to do that?

2340
01:47:28,201 --> 01:47:30,900
One of their ruined everything when 
they're nonsense.

2341
01:47:31,140 --> 01:47:34,320
Just orange and black.
We live in a commercial,

2342
01:47:34,350 --> 01:47:39,350
you know,
we live in a commercial society right 

2343
01:47:39,350 --> 01:47:41,630
there.
They got to push something else out 

2344
01:47:41,630 --> 01:47:41,630
there.

2345
01:47:41,630 --> 01:47:41,630
I don't know,
you know,

2346
01:47:41,630 --> 01:47:42,200
it's the same thing that,
you know,

2347
01:47:42,300 --> 01:47:46,440
there's a white bus fleet.
Buzzfeed is always,

2348
01:47:46,490 --> 01:47:51,490
you know,
there's crazy headlines about crazy 

2349
01:47:51,490 --> 01:47:52,160
stuff that's inflammatory and whatever.
Click bait like.

2350
01:47:52,350 --> 01:47:53,340
Exactly.
Yeah.

2351
01:47:53,790 --> 01:47:57,750
Do you grow your own vegetables?
That's our next thing that we're looking

2352
01:47:57,751 --> 01:48:02,390
into and we have a bunch of land so I as
underutilized and,

2353
01:48:02,450 --> 01:48:05,460
and so we just started meeting with a 
bunch of people to start.

2354
01:48:05,790 --> 01:48:07,010
Start growing.
Yeah,

2355
01:48:07,011 --> 01:48:12,011
it,
we've been doing that for awhile now at 

2356
01:48:12,011 --> 01:48:12,011
my house and it's was very rewarding to 
have like a,

2357
01:48:12,011 --> 01:48:13,520
we had a cucumber salad the other day,
cucumber,

2358
01:48:13,540 --> 01:48:15,600
tomato salad.
It was so good.

2359
01:48:15,630 --> 01:48:18,950
It was like this.
I saw this when it was a fucking seed in

2360
01:48:18,951 --> 01:48:20,790
a little container and put it in the 
dirt.

2361
01:48:20,791 --> 01:48:22,950
And um,
what do you use for to.

2362
01:48:22,960 --> 01:48:24,940
Oh,
you don't grow so you don't have like A.

2363
01:48:24,940 --> 01:48:25,300
Yeah,
we're,

2364
01:48:25,301 --> 01:48:26,100
we're,
I mean,

2365
01:48:26,101 --> 01:48:26,650
you know,
we'll,

2366
01:48:26,651 --> 01:48:28,080
we'll get into that once we start 
growing,

2367
01:48:28,081 --> 01:48:31,370
but the one thing that we are doing,
which is fucking awesome is a,

2368
01:48:32,040 --> 01:48:33,660
we started,
um,

2369
01:48:33,900 --> 01:48:35,700
we have,
we have all these uh,

2370
01:48:35,820 --> 01:48:40,820
beehives now we have like 30 hives that 
our house that we're hosting for a 

2371
01:48:41,611 --> 01:48:46,050
friend who is like an organic beekeeper 
who creates his own honey.

2372
01:48:46,470 --> 01:48:49,860
And that's been super interesting also 
for the kids to like learn about,

2373
01:48:49,880 --> 01:48:51,120
you know,
what that's all about.

2374
01:48:51,150 --> 01:48:53,550
I mean that is so interesting.
That's cool.

2375
01:48:53,551 --> 01:48:54,810
Works,
which is really cool.

2376
01:48:54,870 --> 01:48:57,060
I want to do that.
And I also,

2377
01:48:57,061 --> 01:48:58,290
I was thinking about doing that.
I was like,

2378
01:48:58,291 --> 01:49:03,291
God,
it's a lot of work and bringing the 

2379
01:49:03,291 --> 01:49:04,611
fucking beehive guy and all,
but I found out about this new 

2380
01:49:04,611 --> 01:49:04,611
invention.
Yeah.

2381
01:49:04,611 --> 01:49:08,100
This guy that Australia is created,
you've seen it all the tap.

2382
01:49:08,160 --> 01:49:08,880
It's the.
Yeah.

2383
01:49:08,881 --> 01:49:11,290
He had like the craziest kickstarter of 
all time.

2384
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:14,940
He raised like insane millions of 
dollars.

2385
01:49:14,941 --> 01:49:17,940
He was only trying to raise 100 grand or
200 grand or something and you've raised

2386
01:49:18,430 --> 01:49:23,430
$4 million dollars in like no time 
because it's in his invention is so 

2387
01:49:23,430 --> 01:49:23,880
astounding.
Well,

2388
01:49:23,881 --> 01:49:25,590
I was definitely a part of that because 
when I got it,

2389
01:49:25,591 --> 01:49:26,890
it wasn't nearly that much.
I,

2390
01:49:26,900 --> 01:49:28,380
I've,
I tweeted the shit out of that.

2391
01:49:28,381 --> 01:49:29,760
I thought it was amazing.
It's a,

2392
01:49:29,940 --> 01:49:34,940
you take have.
You actually probably had a lot to do 

2393
01:49:34,940 --> 01:49:35,040
with him raising all a little bit of 
something interesting.

2394
01:49:35,041 --> 01:49:37,140
I'm sure a lot of people reacted the way
I will look.

2395
01:49:37,210 --> 01:49:40,650
The 100 percent of what had to do with 
it was this invention is amazing.

2396
01:49:40,950 --> 01:49:44,310
Twelve dollars million.
Holy Shit Dude.

2397
01:49:44,320 --> 01:49:46,260
When I looked at it,
I swear to God,

2398
01:49:46,261 --> 01:49:48,460
I don't think it was more than a couple 
hundred thousand dollars.

2399
01:49:48,490 --> 01:49:49,410
I mean,
I think I looked,

2400
01:49:49,510 --> 01:49:54,070
I looked at it maybe a couple of weeks 
ago and I think it was like at four,

2401
01:49:55,420 --> 01:49:57,040
which is a lot.
That's amazing,

2402
01:49:57,460 --> 01:50:00,490
but it just shows how cool it is a good 
idea,

2403
01:50:00,491 --> 01:50:02,710
you know,
play it because it's really amazing.

2404
01:50:02,711 --> 01:50:03,790
If anybody hasn't heard,
well,

2405
01:50:03,791 --> 01:50:05,570
you know the people that are listening,
you're,

2406
01:50:05,580 --> 01:50:10,580
you're only going to hear it,
but this guy invented a beehive that 

2407
01:50:10,580 --> 01:50:13,921
essentially has a.
there's a dial that you can turn and the

2408
01:50:14,111 --> 01:50:17,350
dial changes the honeycombs into a flow 
pattern.

2409
01:50:17,530 --> 01:50:22,530
It actually opens up and then the honey 
drips down slowly into these jars.

2410
01:50:22,991 --> 01:50:27,991
It doesn't disturb the BS.
It doesn't disturb any of the normal 

2411
01:50:28,121 --> 01:50:33,121
natural processes that these bees engage
in to make honey and it's so much less 

2412
01:50:35,051 --> 01:50:38,170
invasive and when you see it,
if you go to the video,

2413
01:50:38,171 --> 01:50:43,171
it's called flow hive.
If you go to the video online and 

2414
01:50:43,171 --> 01:50:44,770
they'll do a much better job of 
explaining how all this is made,

2415
01:50:44,771 --> 01:50:47,110
but it's a.
it's really fucking cool,

2416
01:50:47,180 --> 01:50:48,320
right?
Indiegogo,

2417
01:50:48,960 --> 01:50:53,440
indiegogo campaign,
but you don't get the bee pollen and uh,

2418
01:50:53,441 --> 01:50:54,700
you don't get the,
uh,

2419
01:50:54,740 --> 01:50:57,280
the actual honeycomb itself,
which I like to eat.

2420
01:50:57,740 --> 01:50:58,960
I love that stuff.
Yeah.

2421
01:50:58,970 --> 01:51:03,970
I mean,
the idea is that you're not disturbing 

2422
01:51:03,970 --> 01:51:03,970
the bees,
right?

2423
01:51:03,970 --> 01:51:06,241
You're not really invading their,
you're not impeding on their kind of 

2424
01:51:06,241 --> 01:51:06,241
habitat.

2425
01:51:06,241 --> 01:51:09,410
Was that funny Vegan now because honey 
wasn't Vegan for a long

2426
01:51:09,460 --> 01:51:11,030
time.
I mean,

2427
01:51:11,540 --> 01:51:13,160
look,
there are,

2428
01:51:14,110 --> 01:51:16,970
there is a hardcore Vegan perspective 
that,

2429
01:51:17,060 --> 01:51:18,450
that honey,
you know,

2430
01:51:18,451 --> 01:51:22,020
you shouldn't eat honey animal product,
um,

2431
01:51:22,550 --> 01:51:27,550
but it's not.
And I respect people that have that 

2432
01:51:27,550 --> 01:51:27,550
opinion.
I mean,

2433
01:51:27,550 --> 01:51:27,550
I think that,
you know,

2434
01:51:27,550 --> 01:51:29,780
my perspective on it is,
is that,

2435
01:51:30,230 --> 01:51:35,230
you know,
our bee populations are threatened and 

2436
01:51:35,230 --> 01:51:35,230
because of,
you know,

2437
01:51:35,230 --> 01:51:37,790
he has to be in fucking idiots and you 
know,

2438
01:51:37,791 --> 01:51:39,770
we've,
we've fucked a lot of shit up,

2439
01:51:39,771 --> 01:51:40,630
right?
Phones too.

2440
01:51:40,640 --> 01:51:42,260
Right?
And so I think that,

2441
01:51:42,320 --> 01:51:43,760
that,
you know,

2442
01:51:44,350 --> 01:51:49,100
our family is trying to be of service by
helping foster,

2443
01:51:49,130 --> 01:51:54,130
you know,
co the cultivation of bee populations 

2444
01:51:54,130 --> 01:51:54,130
and uh,
you know,

2445
01:51:54,130 --> 01:51:57,140
in a sustainable way like by being,
by getting involved,

2446
01:51:57,470 --> 01:51:58,070
you know,
there's one,

2447
01:51:58,100 --> 01:52:00,050
there's one school of thought like we'll
leave it alone,

2448
01:52:00,051 --> 01:52:01,700
right.
But this is a,

2449
01:52:01,790 --> 01:52:03,190
this is a threatened,
you know,

2450
01:52:03,330 --> 01:52:06,330
population that needs a little bit of 
know,

2451
01:52:06,440 --> 01:52:11,420
graceful intervention were to help help 
them foster their population.

2452
01:52:11,421 --> 01:52:14,870
So to the extent that I can play a small
part in that,

2453
01:52:14,871 --> 01:52:16,130
I think that's a cool thing.

2454
01:52:16,550 --> 01:52:17,900
No,
I think that's a cool thing as well.

2455
01:52:17,901 --> 01:52:19,100
And I,
and I agree,

2456
01:52:19,101 --> 01:52:20,040
there's,
there's that,

2457
01:52:20,360 --> 01:52:25,360
the very hardcore a segment of the Vegan
population that don't think that you 

2458
01:52:25,360 --> 01:52:27,740
should eat honey,
but they don't have it like this,

2459
01:52:27,770 --> 01:52:28,570
you know,
this is like,

2460
01:52:28,850 --> 01:52:33,850
normally when you get honey,
it's like this really complicated 

2461
01:52:33,850 --> 01:52:33,850
process.
You have to pull the,

2462
01:52:33,850 --> 01:52:38,760
the hives out and you have to scrape the
honey off and extract it in that way.

2463
01:52:39,550 --> 01:52:41,540
This is,
it's totally different.

2464
01:52:41,541 --> 01:52:44,810
It's a different animal than commercial 
honey production.

2465
01:52:44,840 --> 01:52:45,800
You,
there's

2466
01:52:46,190 --> 01:52:49,880
practices involved with that that are 
harmful to those insects,

2467
01:52:49,910 --> 01:52:54,910
right?
So to the extent that you can find a 

2468
01:52:54,910 --> 01:52:54,910
better way to do it,
um,

2469
01:52:54,910 --> 01:52:57,860
where you're still able to harvest the 
honey in a way that,

2470
01:52:58,070 --> 01:52:59,250
that is not,
you know,

2471
01:52:59,270 --> 01:53:03,830
kind of overly tapping into what they 
need to survive and thrive.

2472
01:53:03,910 --> 01:53:05,480
Um,
I don't know.

2473
01:53:05,960 --> 01:53:06,620
It's also,
again,

2474
01:53:06,621 --> 01:53:07,400
this is like,
you know,

2475
01:53:07,401 --> 01:53:10,360
it gets into like splitting hairs.
It's like,

2476
01:53:10,361 --> 01:53:15,361
all right,
we're going to talk about this when we 

2477
01:53:15,361 --> 01:53:15,361
have,
you know,

2478
01:53:15,361 --> 01:53:15,361
when,
you know,

2479
01:53:15,361 --> 01:53:17,980
55 percent of co two emissions is caused
by animal agriculture.

2480
01:53:18,150 --> 01:53:20,780
We have bigger fish to fry,
bigger things like,

2481
01:53:20,781 --> 01:53:21,650
so,
you know,

2482
01:53:21,651 --> 01:53:23,790
I'm just trying to kind of,
you know,

2483
01:53:24,070 --> 01:53:26,110
help bee populations in,
in,

2484
01:53:26,140 --> 01:53:29,030
in our tiny little way by educating my 
kids about it.

2485
01:53:29,031 --> 01:53:31,640
And by being a home to these 40 hives,
which is a trip.

2486
01:53:32,110 --> 01:53:33,690
It's a lot of hives,
40 hives,

2487
01:53:33,740 --> 01:53:35,890
you have eli,
how there's this.

2488
01:53:36,030 --> 01:53:38,810
They're like,
I think they stack them for high.

2489
01:53:38,840 --> 01:53:41,840
So there's 10 of those 10 bottles.
Towers.

2490
01:53:41,870 --> 01:53:43,850
Yeah,
down the hill,

2491
01:53:43,880 --> 01:53:45,890
I dunno,
three or four feet high.

2492
01:53:46,530 --> 01:53:47,480
Um,
and it was,

2493
01:53:47,510 --> 01:53:50,840
they brought them in the middle of the 
night and it was like,

2494
01:53:50,841 --> 01:53:53,060
okay,
like are we going to have swarming be,

2495
01:53:53,061 --> 01:53:58,061
you know,
as they're going to be like we were 

2496
01:53:58,061 --> 01:53:58,061
like,
don't go near them for a couple days,

2497
01:53:58,061 --> 01:53:58,700
like let them acclimate,
you know,

2498
01:53:58,701 --> 01:54:02,110
they have to get used to like their 
environment and what sorts of.

2499
01:54:02,360 --> 01:54:04,620
I mean,
the way that bee populations function is

2500
01:54:04,700 --> 01:54:05,090
a trip

2501
01:54:05,240 --> 01:54:07,220
is really trippy.
The little aliens.

2502
01:54:07,460 --> 01:54:10,790
Do you have to plan specific flowers 
around your area to help them?

2503
01:54:11,300 --> 01:54:11,820
We haven't had,

2504
01:54:11,860 --> 01:54:16,860
did you that?
I mean the big kind of hurdle that we 

2505
01:54:16,860 --> 01:54:17,170
had to get over was making sure that we 
had adequate water supply for them.

2506
01:54:17,230 --> 01:54:19,750
But I'm not that I'm aware of.

2507
01:54:19,960 --> 01:54:24,960
We have in our,
on our property we have specific plants 

2508
01:54:24,960 --> 01:54:26,740
and flowers that attract bees and the 
other ones that attract hummingbirds.

2509
01:54:27,070 --> 01:54:30,610
We have a lot of hummingbirds on our 
property just because of that because we

2510
01:54:30,611 --> 01:54:32,860
put certain,
certain plants and flowers.

2511
01:54:33,310 --> 01:54:37,990
But the bees have a real issue 
apparently with cell phones.

2512
01:54:38,430 --> 01:54:40,570
Um,
I was reading this whole thing about how

2513
01:54:40,750 --> 01:54:44,260
the towers like impact them some,
the actual signals themselves,

2514
01:54:44,300 --> 01:54:49,300
they,
they impact the bees' ability to 

2515
01:54:49,300 --> 01:54:49,300
communicate.
They fuck with their head.

2516
01:54:49,300 --> 01:54:49,300
They can hear that shit.

2517
01:54:49,630 --> 01:54:52,860
It wouldn't surprise me and the way that
they have the high,

2518
01:54:52,900 --> 01:54:55,270
they literally have the hive mind and 
the way that they,

2519
01:54:55,450 --> 01:54:57,770
they sort of functioned in that way.
Like the,

2520
01:54:58,370 --> 01:55:03,370
you know,
the frequency at which they're 

2521
01:55:03,370 --> 01:55:03,370
communicating is so mysterious and 
amazing.

2522
01:55:03,370 --> 01:55:04,790
Yeah.
So it's so cool.

2523
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:07,430
I've told this story before,
but you might not have heard it.

2524
01:55:07,431 --> 01:55:11,060
When we were on fear factor,
one of the stunts they had these people,

2525
01:55:11,090 --> 01:55:15,440
they're the data get handcuffed to a 
pole or something like that.

2526
01:55:15,441 --> 01:55:19,700
And then we covered them with bs and 
while we're doing this,

2527
01:55:19,730 --> 01:55:24,730
the beekeeper told us that we had to 
stop filming because a local population 

2528
01:55:26,691 --> 01:55:31,691
of bees had came over to investigate his
population of bees and they were above 

2529
01:55:32,211 --> 01:55:34,100
us in this cloud,
in the air,

2530
01:55:34,101 --> 01:55:35,720
sorting it out.
They weren't fighting.

2531
01:55:35,930 --> 01:55:38,750
They were somehow or another 
communicating like,

2532
01:55:38,751 --> 01:55:40,100
who the fuck are you guys?
Oh man,

2533
01:55:40,101 --> 01:55:41,200
we're here for a TV show.
Okay,

2534
01:55:41,210 --> 01:55:42,680
so you're not moving in?
No,

2535
01:55:42,860 --> 01:55:44,010
we're not moving in.
Are you guys

2536
01:55:44,010 --> 01:55:45,720
taking our pollen?
No,

2537
01:55:45,780 --> 01:55:48,180
we're not taking your pile.
Like and they had an,

2538
01:55:48,181 --> 01:55:53,181
they worked it out.
They worked it out and then they 

2539
01:55:53,181 --> 01:55:53,340
disappeared and then we kept filming but
it took,

2540
01:55:53,341 --> 01:55:55,710
we had an amazing.
It was really cool.

2541
01:55:55,890 --> 01:55:58,600
It was really cool to watch because it 
was like what is going on and not,

2542
01:55:58,620 --> 01:56:00,810
you know,
and I mean everybody was,

2543
01:56:00,840 --> 01:56:05,840
it was weird how people were interested 
in it because Oh we got to stop filming 

2544
01:56:05,840 --> 01:56:10,341
apparently like those local bee 
populations intermix with this be 

2545
01:56:10,341 --> 01:56:10,341
published.
And I was like,

2546
01:56:10,341 --> 01:56:11,670
what?
First of all I was high as fuck.

2547
01:56:11,730 --> 01:56:14,100
So it was super,
super interesting to me.

2548
01:56:14,101 --> 01:56:14,820
So I was like,
wait a minute,

2549
01:56:14,821 --> 01:56:19,821
wait a minute.
When they're talking like how do you 

2550
01:56:19,821 --> 01:56:19,821
know whose Beezer,
who's bs?

2551
01:56:19,821 --> 01:56:23,480
He goes and he was like,
you could tell just by the way there 

2552
01:56:23,480 --> 01:56:24,240
they're swarming in the air or they're 
trying to work this out.

2553
01:56:24,240 --> 01:56:29,240
And so there was this small cloud of 
these bees because he had brought a lot 

2554
01:56:29,240 --> 01:56:33,411
of bees and the local bees got together 
with his bees and they were hovering,

2555
01:56:33,780 --> 01:56:37,380
but they had to disperse like they told 
everyone to get away.

2556
01:56:37,620 --> 01:56:40,800
They told the crew to get away.
Everyone leave the area,

2557
01:56:41,050 --> 01:56:46,050
you know,
he wanted to make sure that there was 

2558
01:56:46,050 --> 01:56:46,530
nothing fucking with this interaction.
This strange because he has.

2559
01:56:46,600 --> 01:56:48,450
You have like the BBC.
Yeah,

2560
01:56:48,451 --> 01:56:50,280
he will.
He's a deep respect for bees.

2561
01:56:50,330 --> 01:56:52,410
This guy really does love bees was 
really,

2562
01:56:52,740 --> 01:56:57,740
really interesting.
It was interesting for me too because I 

2563
01:56:57,740 --> 01:56:58,140
was covered with bees and that episode.
I mean they were all over my hair,

2564
01:56:58,150 --> 01:57:01,480
my face and my arms and everything like 
that and I never got stung.

2565
01:57:02,080 --> 01:57:04,410
Gets done.
A couple people got stung on the set,

2566
01:57:04,680 --> 01:57:06,000
but I don't know what happened.

2567
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:07,200
It could have been like,
you know,

2568
01:57:07,201 --> 01:57:09,450
like maybe if like a bs in your armpit 
and you,

2569
01:57:09,500 --> 01:57:14,500
you,
you move your arm and it gets trapped 

2570
01:57:14,500 --> 01:57:14,500
and it's like fuck this and it stings 
you.

2571
01:57:14,500 --> 01:57:19,070
Probably just just accidental 
circumstances that came from having 

2572
01:57:19,070 --> 01:57:19,690
millions or thousands or whatever it 
was.

2573
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:20,580
Right,
right.

2574
01:57:21,090 --> 01:57:22,170
That's pretty interesting.
Yeah,

2575
01:57:22,171 --> 01:57:27,171
it was really cool.
It was really cool seeing them all get 

2576
01:57:27,171 --> 01:57:28,920
together and try to figure it out and 
just flying overhead.

2577
01:57:29,450 --> 01:57:34,450
Just communicating in some way that we 
just really don't even have a clue.

2578
01:57:34,830 --> 01:57:39,830
We believe pheromones are involved,
but we also know that there's some sort 

2579
01:57:39,830 --> 01:57:41,430
of signal that they're sending out and 
we just don't know what it is.

2580
01:57:41,820 --> 01:57:44,910
You know?
This whole insect world is a real trip.

2581
01:57:44,940 --> 01:57:49,940
I mean they really are alien.
They really are some strange alien life 

2582
01:57:50,731 --> 01:57:52,110
form.
We found them on another planet.

2583
01:57:52,110 --> 01:57:53,500
We will be blown away.
Yeah.

2584
01:57:55,230 --> 01:57:58,250
I mean just the idea that there's a 
queen and,

2585
01:57:58,330 --> 01:58:00,570
and,
and,

2586
01:58:00,690 --> 01:58:02,970
and the fact that the hive is lost 
without it.

2587
01:58:03,020 --> 01:58:08,020
Yeah.
And that everything kind of falls into 

2588
01:58:08,020 --> 01:58:09,951
place when the,
when the queen is inserted into the 

2589
01:58:09,951 --> 01:58:10,080
population.
I mean,

2590
01:58:10,081 --> 01:58:11,200
I can't begin to,
you know,

2591
01:58:11,360 --> 01:58:13,980
like I know very little about this.
How about the Queens?

2592
01:58:13,981 --> 01:58:17,040
A murderous bitch.
She's got a fucking Stinger that doesn't

2593
01:58:17,041 --> 01:58:18,060
come off.
It doesn't,

2594
01:58:18,061 --> 01:58:21,750
she doesn't have like barbs on it the 
way everyone else does and what she does

2595
01:58:21,751 --> 01:58:26,751
is she wanders around the hive looking 
for female babies and she stabs him 

2596
01:58:26,751 --> 01:58:28,350
right through the honeycomb.
Yeah,

2597
01:58:28,650 --> 01:58:30,960
that's what the female users.
Oh,

2598
01:58:31,140 --> 01:58:33,480
it's awful.
She's fucking heartless cunt.

2599
01:58:33,900 --> 01:58:38,900
And one day she will be usurped.
There were a new female will come along 

2600
01:58:38,900 --> 01:58:42,070
and kick her ass and that's it.
But right now

2601
01:58:42,130 --> 01:58:47,130
she's going to stab those babies.
So she runs around like sticking her 

2602
01:58:47,130 --> 01:58:50,650
needle and the honeycomb when she smells
a female fucking girl in there and take 

2603
01:58:50,650 --> 01:58:55,150
my spot.
No threat to the throne.

2604
01:58:55,210 --> 01:58:56,680
Yeah.
It's very bizarre.

2605
01:58:56,681 --> 01:59:01,280
World of bugs.
Have you ever seen the leaf cutter ant a

2606
01:59:01,510 --> 01:59:03,340
documentary?
They did where they,

2607
01:59:04,030 --> 01:59:09,030
they cemented,
they poured cement through this leaf 

2608
01:59:09,030 --> 01:59:12,910
cutter ant hive,
this enormous hill.

2609
01:59:13,300 --> 01:59:18,300
And then they dug it out and structure.
It was incredibly labyrinthine right?

2610
01:59:19,541 --> 01:59:21,400
And it went,
it was vast.

2611
01:59:21,830 --> 01:59:25,270
It was huge,
huge and incredibly complex.

2612
01:59:25,540 --> 01:59:30,540
Like they had areas where these leaves 
would ferment and then they had pipes 

2613
01:59:31,810 --> 01:59:36,250
that led tubes that lead through to the 
sky or to the,

2614
01:59:36,251 --> 01:59:41,251
uh,
the surface area where they would hit 

2615
01:59:41,251 --> 01:59:41,251
air so that they could the fermentation 
process,

2616
01:59:41,251 --> 01:59:42,430
the gases can be released.
Yeah.

2617
01:59:42,431 --> 01:59:47,431
That's crazy.
Like with these tiny brains figure out 

2618
01:59:47,440 --> 01:59:48,830
like we don't even know like,
well,

2619
01:59:48,910 --> 01:59:51,610
human beings would fuck that up and it 
makes sense for sure.

2620
01:59:51,850 --> 01:59:54,730
Unions will get involved.
And there it is again.

2621
01:59:54,790 --> 01:59:55,720
Look at that.
Oh right.

2622
01:59:55,721 --> 01:59:56,200
Yeah,
I did.

2623
01:59:56,230 --> 01:59:58,870
I did see this industry in the rain 
forest.

2624
01:59:58,871 --> 02:00:03,871
Right.
It's like they did an archeological dig 

2625
02:00:03,871 --> 02:00:03,871
to like extract it,
right?

2626
02:00:03,871 --> 02:00:07,620
Yeah.
They filled it up with cement and I 

2627
02:00:07,620 --> 02:00:07,620
mean,
first of all,

2628
02:00:07,620 --> 02:00:08,650
it's an enormous.
When you look at how wide it is,

2629
02:00:08,651 --> 02:00:12,760
it's probably 50 feet wide and it's 
insane.

2630
02:00:12,761 --> 02:00:16,720
It's very deep as well.
And there's so much to it.

2631
02:00:17,050 --> 02:00:22,050
There's so much going on there.
And how are they communicating with who 

2632
02:00:22,050 --> 02:00:26,410
was the architect of all this structure?
How did they figure this out?

2633
02:00:26,670 --> 02:00:30,880
We all know how to do this.
Like what in the fuck man.

2634
02:00:32,290 --> 02:00:34,570
Unbelievable.
Unbelievable.

2635
02:00:34,580 --> 02:00:39,580
And a huge fucking mystery.
And until a decade or two ago we had no 

2636
02:00:40,421 --> 02:00:42,580
idea what the fuck was even below the 
surface.

2637
02:00:42,581 --> 02:00:44,560
We had no idea what they were doing down
there.

2638
02:00:44,890 --> 02:00:49,890
I mean it really is amazing.
It is just absolutely amazing.

2639
02:00:51,310 --> 02:00:54,090
Have you seen the ant death spiral?
Have you ever seen that now?

2640
02:00:54,200 --> 02:00:59,200
Well that's a trip.
It like king of the obscure animal 

2641
02:00:59,200 --> 02:00:59,470
video.
So I do remember it.

2642
02:00:59,510 --> 02:01:04,510
Spring free time.
And I love to watch a animal nature 

2643
02:01:04,510 --> 02:01:06,970
videos cause I think it's very under 
appreciated.

2644
02:01:07,020 --> 02:01:10,660
The,
the uniqueness or the just the,

2645
02:01:10,690 --> 02:01:13,860
just the eccentricities of the animal 
world.

2646
02:01:14,030 --> 02:01:18,760
Just how amazing and fascinating.
What is that it is that crazy?

2647
02:01:18,820 --> 02:01:22,620
A rodent that looks like a few bar.
Yeah.

2648
02:01:22,920 --> 02:01:25,000
Did you see that one where they're 
climbing into a hot tub?

2649
02:01:26,020 --> 02:01:28,870
Like this hot tub party?
There's an animal.

2650
02:01:28,900 --> 02:01:30,960
There's an amazing.
Alright,

2651
02:01:31,090 --> 02:01:34,120
this is an ant carol.
And this is when the queen dies.

2652
02:01:34,480 --> 02:01:37,930
When the queen dies and the scent is no 
longer there.

2653
02:01:37,931 --> 02:01:40,340
They don't know who to follow,
don't know what the fuck to do.

2654
02:01:40,640 --> 02:01:45,640
And they go into this spiral and they 
will just do this until they run out of 

2655
02:01:45,741 --> 02:01:50,741
energy and food and they will fucking 
die is probably literally shitty job.

2656
02:01:52,580 --> 02:01:56,010
They'll just continue to spend like that
until they just parish.

2657
02:01:56,050 --> 02:01:56,740
Yeah.
Yeah.

2658
02:01:57,380 --> 02:01:59,570
They don't know where to go.
They don't know who to follow.

2659
02:01:59,630 --> 02:02:04,630
I mean there's a,
there's a hierarchy in the ant 

2660
02:02:04,630 --> 02:02:04,630
community.
Uh,

2661
02:02:04,630 --> 02:02:06,800
I'm sure it could be explained cve,
find an explanation for Jamie.

2662
02:02:07,540 --> 02:02:09,530
I probably butchered it,
but the,

2663
02:02:09,720 --> 02:02:14,720
the idea being that they're following 
the scent of the Queen and somehow or 

2664
02:02:14,720 --> 02:02:14,900
another lose it.
And so they don't know what to do.

2665
02:02:14,901 --> 02:02:16,250
So they just start going into the 
spiral.

2666
02:02:16,270 --> 02:02:18,410
Maybe someone stepped on the queen or 
something happened.

2667
02:02:18,411 --> 02:02:23,411
They removed the queen perhaps.
And a bird might've stolen the queen 

2668
02:02:23,820 --> 02:02:27,350
like a dragon come down,
swoop and take away their queen.

2669
02:02:28,670 --> 02:02:30,860
Now.
World's crazy mysterious place.

2670
02:02:30,950 --> 02:02:33,020
Well,
insects in particular,

2671
02:02:33,080 --> 02:02:33,660
could we,
we,

2672
02:02:33,700 --> 02:02:36,650
we know we don't think of him that much 
because they're so small,

2673
02:02:36,890 --> 02:02:41,890
but ants have the almost exact same 
calculated biomass as human beings when 

2674
02:02:43,431 --> 02:02:48,431
it comes to weight,
meaning that there is exactly the same 

2675
02:02:48,431 --> 02:02:51,371
amount of ant weight per the bodies of 
ants on earth is there are humans.

2676
02:02:52,010 --> 02:02:54,530
Oh,
you mean in total total.

2677
02:02:54,531 --> 02:02:56,720
Like if you added up all the ants and 
all the humans,

2678
02:02:56,730 --> 02:02:58,970
that the,
the total mass would be the equal.

2679
02:03:00,080 --> 02:03:00,860
Yeah,
that's crazy.

2680
02:03:02,090 --> 02:03:07,090
That's so many answer are how many 
fucking answers it take to equal 180 

2681
02:03:08,901 --> 02:03:11,030
pound person.
It's got to be a lot.

2682
02:03:11,090 --> 02:03:13,180
What's the average height or weight of a
person?

2683
02:03:13,181 --> 02:03:15,980
It's probably somewhere around there,
like one 60 or something like that.

2684
02:03:15,981 --> 02:03:17,120
You know,
between men and women.

2685
02:03:17,340 --> 02:03:18,740
Not In the US.
Yeah,

2686
02:03:18,741 --> 02:03:20,680
it's like a hundred pounds more than 
that,

2687
02:03:20,700 --> 02:03:22,460
right?
The average.

2688
02:03:22,740 --> 02:03:25,040
It was a how to make ants commit 
suicide.

2689
02:03:25,041 --> 02:03:28,220
We go into a spiral.
You can make them do it.

2690
02:03:28,310 --> 02:03:29,630
Why would you do that?
Dick?

2691
02:03:31,950 --> 02:03:35,600
Simply divert the ants into an enclosed 
space such as a plant pot,

2692
02:03:35,630 --> 02:03:40,630
large discovers a staggering 1000,
200 feet in diameter with each ant 

2693
02:03:41,330 --> 02:03:44,000
completing a circuit every two and a 
half hours.

2694
02:03:44,001 --> 02:03:48,550
Holy Shit.
Whoa.

2695
02:03:48,650 --> 02:03:53,650
So you can make them do it that I'm able
to break free owing to their lack of 

2696
02:03:54,261 --> 02:03:56,900
sight and they march around in a loop 
until they dropped dead.

2697
02:03:56,901 --> 02:03:58,880
What does it say before that explains 
it?

2698
02:03:58,940 --> 02:04:03,940
How do they remove the army?
Has Navigate by following the pheromone 

2699
02:04:03,940 --> 02:04:04,820
trails left behind by others.
However,

2700
02:04:05,330 --> 02:04:10,330
should enough of them lose the scent,
they begin to follow the aunt 

2701
02:04:10,330 --> 02:04:11,420
immediately in front of them and a huge 
ant spiral forums.

2702
02:04:11,720 --> 02:04:14,710
Ah,
it.

2703
02:04:14,970 --> 02:04:17,000
Follow the scent of those in front of 
them.

2704
02:04:17,001 --> 02:04:20,300
Lots of fucking trip.
And how weird.

2705
02:04:20,900 --> 02:04:25,700
It was weird that not only did nature 
somehow or another have a need for this,

2706
02:04:26,180 --> 02:04:28,070
but it,
you know,

2707
02:04:28,071 --> 02:04:33,071
it came about,
it developed and it's been the same way 

2708
02:04:34,580 --> 02:04:37,490
that way for who knows how many of 
years.

2709
02:04:37,530 --> 02:04:39,840
What is the evolutionary purpose of that
though?

2710
02:04:40,870 --> 02:04:43,500
Just they follow each other.
They can't see shit,

2711
02:04:44,290 --> 02:04:47,910
but who the fuck is the first guy who?
What does he know?

2712
02:04:48,190 --> 02:04:53,190
How does he know what he's doing?
Should go and deep joe believes in 

2713
02:04:53,550 --> 02:04:57,450
making these from fermentation bowls and
the ground and like,

2714
02:04:57,451 --> 02:04:59,760
wow,
trippy fucking world.

2715
02:04:59,761 --> 02:05:04,761
The insect world is the insect world to 
me is one of the most bizarre world or 

2716
02:05:04,761 --> 02:05:07,260
the most overlooked because they're so 
small.

2717
02:05:07,261 --> 02:05:10,800
We don't think of him as as alien as 
they truly are.

2718
02:05:10,860 --> 02:05:12,810
You know,
if an ant was the size of a dog,

2719
02:05:12,811 --> 02:05:14,550
it would be the fuck.
I mean,

2720
02:05:14,551 --> 02:05:16,740
it's downright prehistoric.
Oh,

2721
02:05:16,741 --> 02:05:17,820
beyond?
Yeah.

2722
02:05:17,880 --> 02:05:19,140
I mean they're,
they're prehistoric.

2723
02:05:19,141 --> 02:05:21,030
Even to dinosaurs.
Dinosaurs.

2724
02:05:21,031 --> 02:05:26,031
Look at answering.
What the fuck is that crazy thing with 

2725
02:05:26,031 --> 02:05:27,270
an exoskeleton with unbelievable 
physical strength.

2726
02:05:28,050 --> 02:05:29,280
Physical strength than an man has.

2727
02:05:29,360 --> 02:05:32,700
The power to weight ratio is pretty off 
the charts.

2728
02:05:32,780 --> 02:05:33,570
Oh,
it's incredible.

2729
02:05:33,600 --> 02:05:38,600
Incredible.
I'm you ever seen ants carry large 

2730
02:05:38,600 --> 02:05:38,600
things away,
which is what the fuck,

2731
02:05:38,600 --> 02:05:41,520
man.
Now the world is a ruthless,

2732
02:05:41,820 --> 02:05:46,820
evil vicious world to ever see when the 
female ants get ahold of vyvanse leaf 

2733
02:05:47,740 --> 02:05:49,380
cutters as well,
to get a hold of a male.

2734
02:05:49,381 --> 02:05:52,650
Males are larger and they have wings,
might be not be leaf cutters,

2735
02:05:52,651 --> 02:05:54,690
but whatever it is,
they chopped the wings off of the male,

2736
02:05:54,720 --> 02:05:58,050
chop his arms and legs and then carry 
him to the,

2737
02:05:58,080 --> 02:06:02,640
to the hive to breed.
I haven't seen that bitches so rude.

2738
02:06:02,850 --> 02:06:05,410
I had to bone up on my nature videos,
I think.

2739
02:06:06,820 --> 02:06:09,150
Yeah,
I probably have to bone down.

2740
02:06:09,210 --> 02:06:10,800
You probably have too many of them in 
there.

2741
02:06:10,980 --> 02:06:13,170
Too much useless information.
You have the time,

2742
02:06:13,171 --> 02:06:14,700
Joe.
I don't know.

2743
02:06:15,120 --> 02:06:16,200
I don't know where it comes from.

2744
02:06:16,260 --> 02:06:21,260
I just,
I get compelled to research things and 

2745
02:06:21,260 --> 02:06:22,950
to follow up and to start reading and 
watching things.

2746
02:06:22,951 --> 02:06:26,610
And then next thing you know them have 
gone on this crazy cycle.

2747
02:06:26,640 --> 02:06:27,900
Is that a?
Yeah.

2748
02:06:28,710 --> 02:06:31,510
What kind of answered is the biggest 
answer?

2749
02:06:32,640 --> 02:06:34,020
Two and a half inches.
Oh,

2750
02:06:34,290 --> 02:06:35,990
that's a big ass aunt.
Well,

2751
02:06:35,991 --> 02:06:40,991
if you ever seen with wings,
my friend Brian Cowen at one point in 

2752
02:06:40,991 --> 02:06:44,700
time was studying to be a scientist and 
uh,

2753
02:06:44,701 --> 02:06:47,280
he would,
he had spent some time in a rain forest,

2754
02:06:47,281 --> 02:06:50,640
I think it was Borneo,
a new New Guinea and forget what it was,

2755
02:06:51,420 --> 02:06:56,420
but they had to.
Everyone stayed in these tents and he's 

2756
02:06:56,420 --> 02:06:57,460
elevated platforms.
They had a coat.

2757
02:06:57,510 --> 02:07:00,080
The posts with Turpentine.
Yeah,

2758
02:07:00,360 --> 02:07:03,810
because there were so many ants and if 
the army ants found you,

2759
02:07:04,140 --> 02:07:07,380
if they found you in one of them decided
to bite you just like they follow the,

2760
02:07:07,490 --> 02:07:11,310
sent millions and millions and millions 
and they would just eat you alive.

2761
02:07:11,370 --> 02:07:15,030
And people would regularly get killed by
ants there.

2762
02:07:15,180 --> 02:07:18,690
That's crazy.
How about the fact they kill elephants?

2763
02:07:18,870 --> 02:07:23,870
They climb up the elephant's leg,
they find the ear and they start eating 

2764
02:07:23,870 --> 02:07:28,101
the fucking elephant's brain and then 
they all fall ascent and they all 

2765
02:07:28,101 --> 02:07:31,641
follow.
Go up the elephant body and eat his 

2766
02:07:31,641 --> 02:07:34,881
fucking brain alive from the inside and 
kill a lot of things you wouldn't think.

2767
02:07:38,150 --> 02:07:38,730
Well,
it,

2768
02:07:39,020 --> 02:07:44,020
it's all you have to do is leave like 
something out on your kitchen counter 

2769
02:07:44,020 --> 02:07:46,370
for five minutes and out of mysterious 
nowhere.

2770
02:07:46,371 --> 02:07:49,970
A line of ants will appear and then,
and then if you remove it,

2771
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:50,900
they disappear.

2772
02:07:51,760 --> 02:07:56,760
Well,
have you ever seen something outside 

2773
02:07:56,760 --> 02:07:58,621
that wasn't there before and then all of
a sudden the flies find it and then 

2774
02:07:58,621 --> 02:08:00,550
within minutes there's all these fucking
flies.

2775
02:08:00,760 --> 02:08:04,590
There was no flies and then within 
minutes they find this and somehow in or

2776
02:08:04,610 --> 02:08:05,180
they go,
Yo,

2777
02:08:05,181 --> 02:08:05,720
Yo,
Yo,

2778
02:08:05,800 --> 02:08:07,450
here we go,
we've got something.

2779
02:08:07,900 --> 02:08:09,430
And then there's all these fucking 
flies.

2780
02:08:09,940 --> 02:08:11,800
It's very like,
how do they do in that?

2781
02:08:12,060 --> 02:08:13,420
We don't even know.
We have no idea.

2782
02:08:14,170 --> 02:08:16,000
I don't know.
We got diverted.

2783
02:08:16,030 --> 02:08:19,350
You need.
I know you need a insect ologist.

2784
02:08:19,450 --> 02:08:21,070
Is that what they would be called?
Come on,

2785
02:08:21,280 --> 02:08:23,710
sort of a word for that.
What does it show?

2786
02:08:24,130 --> 02:08:25,780
Entomologist emojis.
That's right.

2787
02:08:25,800 --> 02:08:26,590
Is that what it is?
Yeah.

2788
02:08:27,190 --> 02:08:30,670
What's the study of words?
The origins of words at technology.

2789
02:08:31,150 --> 02:08:33,670
Etymology.
Don't get confused.

2790
02:08:33,950 --> 02:08:38,400
They'll order one and get the other.
I'm trying to find out the origin of the

2791
02:08:38,401 --> 02:08:39,520
word cunt.
Well,

2792
02:08:39,521 --> 02:08:42,340
I didn't know about bugs.
I don't know what you're trying to.

2793
02:08:42,380 --> 02:08:44,170
A lot of layers to that.
Brian Callahan.

2794
02:08:44,290 --> 02:08:46,300
What compelled him to want to study 
that?

2795
02:08:47,170 --> 02:08:49,180
I don't know.
There's a lot of layers to Brian.

2796
02:08:49,780 --> 02:08:51,380
Brian's a deep dude.
You know,

2797
02:08:51,680 --> 02:08:54,760
you start getting to know him.
You dig deeper and deeper and deeper.

2798
02:08:54,761 --> 02:08:57,190
You find those educational background 
and he's a.

2799
02:08:57,220 --> 02:08:59,410
He knows a lot of shit about weird 
stuff,

2800
02:09:00,180 --> 02:09:01,180
you know?
Yeah.

2801
02:09:01,181 --> 02:09:02,230
Yeah.
But that,

2802
02:09:02,280 --> 02:09:05,500
that freaked him out.
He said he could hear the marching ants.

2803
02:09:05,530 --> 02:09:06,530
You hear them more?

2804
02:09:08,970 --> 02:09:09,810
Yeah.
That's crazy.

2805
02:09:09,840 --> 02:09:11,490
So many of them on the floor that you 
just,

2806
02:09:11,520 --> 02:09:14,280
you realize like,
oh my God is millions of them.

2807
02:09:15,300 --> 02:09:18,700
You were talking about how you're a huge
radio lab fan,

2808
02:09:18,710 --> 02:09:19,190
right?
Yes.

2809
02:09:19,330 --> 02:09:21,510
Have you,
have you gotten down with this show,

2810
02:09:21,511 --> 02:09:22,940
invisibilia?
No.

2811
02:09:22,970 --> 02:09:24,600
It was pretty cool,
man.

2812
02:09:24,601 --> 02:09:29,601
I think he would dig it.
Is that a difference in other different 

2813
02:09:29,601 --> 02:09:32,481
podcasts?
It's another one of those invasive 

2814
02:09:32,481 --> 02:09:33,780
invisibilia.
It's another kind of NPR offshoot,

2815
02:09:33,840 --> 02:09:38,840
you know,
like how sort of IRA glass at this 

2816
02:09:38,840 --> 02:09:38,840
American life.
All these producers that have worked for

2817
02:09:38,840 --> 02:09:40,560
him have now started all these other 
podcasts.

2818
02:09:41,150 --> 02:09:46,150
I'm super interesting stories.
There was one recently about a guy who I

2819
02:09:47,341 --> 02:09:49,560
guess is a pretty well known guy.
Um,

2820
02:09:49,860 --> 02:09:54,860
he's blind.
I think he went blind as far as it like 

2821
02:09:54,860 --> 02:09:57,261
a four year old or something like that.
He lost his sight and he started in 

2822
02:09:58,200 --> 02:09:58,650
school.

2823
02:09:58,650 --> 02:10:02,410
He started making these like clicking 
noises with his mouth like,

2824
02:10:03,720 --> 02:10:05,610
like that.
And his teachers would say,

2825
02:10:05,611 --> 02:10:06,390
you know,
what are you doing?

2826
02:10:06,391 --> 02:10:07,860
Settle Down,
stop doing that.

2827
02:10:08,400 --> 02:10:13,170
And his mother realized very early on 
that there was some purpose to this.

2828
02:10:13,171 --> 02:10:15,870
There was some reason why he was doing 
this show location.

2829
02:10:15,900 --> 02:10:16,550
Yeah.
And,

2830
02:10:16,551 --> 02:10:21,210
and what they realized is that he was 
developing over many years of practicing

2831
02:10:21,211 --> 02:10:24,960
this,
like a finely attuned sonar ability.

2832
02:10:25,080 --> 02:10:28,370
Like he would literally be able to,
uh,

2833
02:10:29,400 --> 02:10:33,120
figure out like where he was and what 
was in a room and what was going on.

2834
02:10:33,770 --> 02:10:35,540
Basically making these clicking noises 
in the,

2835
02:10:35,541 --> 02:10:37,340
in the,
in the sound waves bouncing off.

2836
02:10:37,341 --> 02:10:42,341
And he developed this acuity to be able 
to discern from that the parameters of 

2837
02:10:42,651 --> 02:10:47,651
his environment to the extent that he,
he like goes running.

2838
02:10:48,560 --> 02:10:51,170
He like rides a bike.
It's insane.

2839
02:10:51,230 --> 02:10:53,980
Like what this guy has been able to do 
as a blind person.

2840
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:59,000
He goes running and his whole thing is.
His whole thing is that he doesn't think

2841
02:10:59,811 --> 02:11:04,811
that he's anything special.
He thinks that all blind people could 

2842
02:11:04,811 --> 02:11:08,890
develop this skill,
but that our education around blindness 

2843
02:11:08,990 --> 02:11:10,520
is sort of,
um,

2844
02:11:10,810 --> 02:11:13,640
a,
a vernacular of disability,

2845
02:11:13,790 --> 02:11:14,840
right?
We're where we say,

2846
02:11:14,841 --> 02:11:15,800
well,
you're disabled.

2847
02:11:15,801 --> 02:11:20,801
You can't do this and we're going to put
you into this system and this is how we 

2848
02:11:20,801 --> 02:11:21,650
do it with blind people.
And he's like,

2849
02:11:21,710 --> 02:11:26,710
that's bullshit.
Like everybody could learn to do what 

2850
02:11:26,710 --> 02:11:29,021
I'm doing.
We need to like empower blind people in 

2851
02:11:29,021 --> 02:11:29,120
this way.
It's super interesting.

2852
02:11:29,140 --> 02:11:30,500
It was like a long interview with this 
guy.

2853
02:11:30,501 --> 02:11:35,501
But anyway,
each week they have some kind of 

2854
02:11:35,501 --> 02:11:35,501
interesting story like that.

2855
02:11:35,501 --> 02:11:35,501
Well,
there was a video of a young kid who can

2856
02:11:35,501 --> 02:11:40,371
do that.
A young kid who walks on the street 

2857
02:11:40,371 --> 02:11:40,950
makes a clicking noises and he knows 
we're trash cans are and stuff.

2858
02:11:41,700 --> 02:11:42,480
That's crazy,
right?

2859
02:11:42,481 --> 02:11:42,830
Yeah.

2860
02:11:43,050 --> 02:11:43,570
Well,
so,

2861
02:11:43,700 --> 02:11:46,880
so like the,
the latent abilities that we all have,

2862
02:11:46,970 --> 02:11:49,580
right?
If we develop them,

2863
02:11:49,581 --> 02:11:54,581
it's sort of like how the disability 
unlocks some other aspect of your brain 

2864
02:11:54,581 --> 02:11:55,310
that that needs to develop in order to 
survive.

2865
02:11:55,620 --> 02:12:00,620
One of the best pool players in the 
world is a young man named Shane van 

2866
02:12:00,620 --> 02:12:01,290
Boning and he's deaf.
It's been deaf since birth.

2867
02:12:01,291 --> 02:12:06,291
And when he plays,
he shuts his hearing aid off and it 

2868
02:12:06,291 --> 02:12:08,040
allows some trademark look at this.
Oh,

2869
02:12:08,041 --> 02:12:11,700
that's the guy that Sam is a different 
guy than the other guy was a young black

2870
02:12:11,701 --> 02:12:12,300
guy.
Right?

2871
02:12:12,301 --> 02:12:14,700
So this is the guy from the,
from that podcast.

2872
02:12:14,730 --> 02:12:16,040
So is he doing okay?
Kish?

2873
02:12:16,400 --> 02:12:18,200
Completely blind.
In fact,

2874
02:12:18,410 --> 02:12:21,680
he doesn't even have eyes say for 
prosthetic ones.

2875
02:12:22,040 --> 02:12:24,830
Daniel has never seen a tree,
a car,

2876
02:12:25,070 --> 02:12:29,330
or even the bicycle he's writing.
So how does he know where he's going?

2877
02:12:29,670 --> 02:12:31,820
He's literally driving on the street 
traffic.

2878
02:12:32,210 --> 02:12:34,940
The answer can be found in the clicking 
sound.

2879
02:12:34,941 --> 02:12:39,941
You hear it's called Echo location.
Bats use it to fly around in the dark 

2880
02:12:40,430 --> 02:12:42,650
and dolphins use it to navigate the 
oceans.

2881
02:12:43,070 --> 02:12:48,070
Daniel uses echolocation or sound to see
every environment has its own acoustical

2882
02:12:50,061 --> 02:12:55,061
signature.
Every surface has its own acoustical 

2883
02:12:55,061 --> 02:12:57,791
signature.
Daniel was born with an aggressive form 

2884
02:12:57,791 --> 02:13:01,031
of cancer called retinoblastoma.
By the time he was 13 months old,

2885
02:13:01,370 --> 02:13:04,700
both of his eyes were removed.
Your 45,

2886
02:13:05,420 --> 02:13:08,120
so you lost your sight at such a young 
age.

2887
02:13:08,450 --> 02:13:12,050
You don't have any,
any memory of vision?

2888
02:13:12,320 --> 02:13:15,440
I have no memories at all.
I was using echolocation from the age of

2889
02:13:15,441 --> 02:13:18,530
two or younger,
but I really didn't know that much about

2890
02:13:18,531 --> 02:13:19,640
it.
It was just how you.

2891
02:13:19,730 --> 02:13:22,820
How you adapted to your environment 
without really understanding it.

2892
02:13:22,821 --> 02:13:25,430
Yes.
I doubt very seriously that most sighted

2893
02:13:25,431 --> 02:13:28,760
people give much thought or attention 
about how they see,

2894
02:13:29,360 --> 02:13:34,360
so I really didn't give thought or 
attention about how I see Daniel uses 

2895
02:13:34,360 --> 02:13:35,130
echolocation to right

2896
02:13:35,320 --> 02:13:35,860
bike

2897
02:13:38,440 --> 02:13:43,440
cook.
Is this a dish that you normally cook 

2898
02:13:43,440 --> 02:13:43,710
Daniel,
or are you experimenting with me?

2899
02:13:47,670 --> 02:13:52,670
Even hike alone in the mountains using 
sound to see can be a hard concept for a

2900
02:13:54,481 --> 02:13:57,030
sighted person to understand what the 
father,

2901
02:13:57,031 --> 02:13:58,290
Daniel,
will tell you.

2902
02:13:58,740 --> 02:14:03,740
He sees his environment as a series of 
images created in his mind based on what

2903
02:14:04,111 --> 02:14:09,111
he hears using echolocation,
so you're calling out into the 

2904
02:14:09,111 --> 02:14:13,111
environment,
you're essentially asking the 

2905
02:14:13,111 --> 02:14:13,111
environment,
what are you and where are you,

2906
02:14:13,111 --> 02:14:17,290
and you're receiving those answers so 
you're getting an image in your mind.

2907
02:14:17,320 --> 02:14:22,320
Yes,
I definitely get a three dimensional 

2908
02:14:22,320 --> 02:14:26,940
images with depth and character and 
richness and I can process those and I 

2909
02:14:30,611 --> 02:14:34,490
can interact with those from his modest 
bungalow in long beach.

2910
02:14:34,610 --> 02:14:38,960
Daniel runs a small nonprofit called 
world access for the blind.

2911
02:14:39,710 --> 02:14:44,660
Since being established in 2000 world 
access has been the lone voice preaching

2912
02:14:44,690 --> 02:14:46,580
echolocation.
In fact,

2913
02:14:46,880 --> 02:14:51,880
every major blind organization in 
America does not support Daniel's 

2914
02:14:51,880 --> 02:14:54,140
mission.
So Daniel,

2915
02:14:54,141 --> 02:14:59,141
the national federation of the blind,
will say that echo location is just too 

2916
02:14:59,141 --> 02:15:03,440
complicated for for most blind people to
grasp.

2917
02:15:03,520 --> 02:15:08,520
It's not so much the federation that's 
that's a concern you have here,

2918
02:15:08,890 --> 02:15:13,890
a blinded ms dot profession.
The blindness field who by and large 

2919
02:15:15,040 --> 02:15:20,040
really kind of interactively remains 
committed,

2920
02:15:20,741 --> 02:15:24,070
if you will,
to a traditional approach,

2921
02:15:24,490 --> 02:15:27,340
which is about,
in my opinion,

2922
02:15:27,400 --> 02:15:31,000
restriction.
It is about this is how you do things,

2923
02:15:31,090 --> 02:15:33,610
this is the right way for a blind person
to do things.

2924
02:15:33,940 --> 02:15:36,820
This is safe,
this isn't safe.

2925
02:15:38,380 --> 02:15:41,710
Watching that guy drive his bike is a 
fucking trip.

2926
02:15:42,340 --> 02:15:43,930
That is bizarre.
Right?

2927
02:15:43,931 --> 02:15:48,931
And so you watch that and it makes you 
just think about human capability in a 

2928
02:15:49,511 --> 02:15:50,890
different way.
Well,

2929
02:15:50,891 --> 02:15:54,730
it certainly does.
It certainly makes you wonder like what?

2930
02:15:55,990 --> 02:15:58,510
What else we could do,
you know,

2931
02:15:58,600 --> 02:16:00,060
if we could figure that out,
if,

2932
02:16:00,061 --> 02:16:05,061
if,
if there's a person like him that can 

2933
02:16:05,061 --> 02:16:07,471
figure out how to see things with his 
sound were making echo locations.

2934
02:16:08,081 --> 02:16:09,640
Like what,
what other,

2935
02:16:09,910 --> 02:16:13,570
what other possible senses could be 
developed?

2936
02:16:14,590 --> 02:16:16,210
And to that extent,
you know,

2937
02:16:17,620 --> 02:16:19,860
well in the animal kingdom there's like 
art,

2938
02:16:19,861 --> 02:16:24,861
they training these German shepherds 
that can smell cancer like early onset 

2939
02:16:25,001 --> 02:16:30,001
of cancer.
They're doing similar things with rats 

2940
02:16:30,001 --> 02:16:33,271
and you know,
I mean obviously those animals have a 

2941
02:16:33,271 --> 02:16:36,781
more developed sense in that area,
but to the extent that human beings have

2942
02:16:37,031 --> 02:16:41,080
unlocked potential in areas that we 
haven't really looked at,

2943
02:16:41,110 --> 02:16:42,220
I think it's pretty interesting.

2944
02:16:42,460 --> 02:16:47,460
Well,
people certainly have finally developed 

2945
02:16:47,460 --> 02:16:49,441
senses like certain people that play 
instruments have finally developed 

2946
02:16:49,441 --> 02:16:52,891
senses of sound.
Somalis have finally developed sense of 

2947
02:16:52,891 --> 02:16:55,270
tastes like he ever talked to someone 
who's like a real wind,

2948
02:16:55,271 --> 02:16:58,780
Somalia and they can,
they can drink a glass of wine,

2949
02:16:58,910 --> 02:17:01,750
have a sip of it and tell you what part 
of the world he came from.

2950
02:17:02,280 --> 02:17:07,280
Like that's real.
That means they can sip it and tell you 

2951
02:17:07,280 --> 02:17:10,330
what part of France there they're 
growing these fucking grapes there.

2952
02:17:10,360 --> 02:17:15,360
These people with crazy noses that work 
in the perfume industry that are highly 

2953
02:17:15,701 --> 02:17:16,920
paid to,
you know,

2954
02:17:17,350 --> 02:17:22,350
decipher these accents.
It's like something I couldn't even 

2955
02:17:22,350 --> 02:17:23,230
relate to,
but I think in general,

2956
02:17:23,820 --> 02:17:26,980
you know,
a need is the mother of that invention.

2957
02:17:26,990 --> 02:17:31,990
Like somebody who's not in Daniel's 
condition is not on their own going to 

2958
02:17:31,990 --> 02:17:33,100
develop echolocation.
Right.

2959
02:17:33,101 --> 02:17:33,700
You know what I mean?

2960
02:17:34,270 --> 02:17:37,630
It also makes you really wonder if there
are fields,

2961
02:17:37,631 --> 02:17:42,631
like we were talking about how bees can 
tune into the sound that a cell phone 

2962
02:17:42,631 --> 02:17:47,581
makes and it fucks with them.
I wonder if there's anything like that 

2963
02:17:47,581 --> 02:17:50,881
that's effecting us and social sort of a
strange way that we're not aware of 

2964
02:17:50,881 --> 02:17:53,740
because one of the things that I'm 
always like really aware of when I go,

2965
02:17:54,220 --> 02:17:59,220
if I go to the wilderness,
if I go to a real wild place is this 

2966
02:17:59,220 --> 02:18:02,980
sound of it is different than the sound 
of silence here.

2967
02:18:03,220 --> 02:18:05,430
Like if you're in a park here and it's 
beautiful,

2968
02:18:05,450 --> 02:18:07,000
it's nature's,
it's nice,

2969
02:18:07,001 --> 02:18:12,001
it's relaxing,
but there's a certain tone to like 

2970
02:18:12,001 --> 02:18:13,930
Prince of Wales Island in Alaska is a 
perfect example.

2971
02:18:14,200 --> 02:18:16,690
We were there and we were on top of this
mountain.

2972
02:18:16,691 --> 02:18:17,590
We're sitting there.
I was like,

2973
02:18:18,190 --> 02:18:19,630
you hear that.
Like it's like,

2974
02:18:19,730 --> 02:18:21,100
it sounds different.

2975
02:18:21,100 --> 02:18:26,100
It feels different here.
It's like you're getting a signal of no 

2976
02:18:26,100 --> 02:18:27,700
signal.
There's no cell phone,

2977
02:18:27,730 --> 02:18:32,730
there's no radio.
You're not tuning into anything other 

2978
02:18:32,730 --> 02:18:36,031
than nature itself and it has a 
different tone to it than a city has.

2979
02:18:36,850 --> 02:18:37,870
Well for sure.
I mean,

2980
02:18:37,871 --> 02:18:40,090
I would say that there's,
you're saying there's no signal,

2981
02:18:40,091 --> 02:18:42,250
but I think there's probably a really 
powerful signal.

2982
02:18:42,251 --> 02:18:45,400
It's just a different signal goes the 
wrong way to say it.

2983
02:18:45,550 --> 02:18:46,710
Yeah.
You know,

2984
02:18:46,880 --> 02:18:51,880
listen,
everything is vibration and energy and 

2985
02:18:51,880 --> 02:18:51,880
if you don't think that,
that,

2986
02:18:51,880 --> 02:18:54,190
uh,
that isn't real,

2987
02:18:54,250 --> 02:18:59,250
you know,
go hang out with negative people for a 

2988
02:18:59,250 --> 02:18:59,660
week and see how you start behaving.
So trying to,

2989
02:18:59,730 --> 02:19:04,730
you know,
an environment is no different and we 

2990
02:19:04,730 --> 02:19:05,950
tend to believe that if we can't see 
something that it's not real.

2991
02:19:05,951 --> 02:19:07,690
So here's,
you know,

2992
02:19:08,050 --> 02:19:13,050
Daniel,
who you know is putting out sound waves 

2993
02:19:13,050 --> 02:19:16,660
into the world and he's able to figure 
out what his environment is.

2994
02:19:16,810 --> 02:19:18,610
You can't see that.
He can't see that.

2995
02:19:18,640 --> 02:19:23,640
But to him it's very real and you know,
we're surrounded by all kinds of crazy 

2996
02:19:24,521 --> 02:19:28,130
invisible energies in waves from cell 
towers to

2997
02:19:28,490 --> 02:19:30,920
Wifi signals and all this kind of stuff.
I mean,

2998
02:19:30,921 --> 02:19:35,921
do we know how this is impacting us?
I know people that are super sensitive 

2999
02:19:35,921 --> 02:19:36,170
to,
to,

3000
02:19:36,171 --> 02:19:39,830
uh,
to Wifi and cell phones,

3001
02:19:39,831 --> 02:19:41,690
like they get headaches and all kinds of
things.

3002
02:19:41,850 --> 02:19:45,650
So what is this Jamie?
Students Science experiment finds plants

3003
02:19:45,651 --> 02:19:47,210
won't grow near Wifi router.

3004
02:19:47,490 --> 02:19:51,720
Some ninth graders in Denmark did a test
where they put what they said was,

3005
02:19:51,721 --> 02:19:56,721
are they tested a.
it's the same radiation of cell phone 

3006
02:19:56,721 --> 02:19:59,481
gives off.
So they put some watercress I think is 

3007
02:19:59,481 --> 02:20:02,241
what it's called,
or garden crest and six trays in one 

3008
02:20:02,241 --> 02:20:05,961
room,
six trays and another with two wifi 

3009
02:20:05,961 --> 02:20:05,961
routers and essentially as you can send 
a picture,

3010
02:20:05,961 --> 02:20:06,480
didn't grow.

3011
02:20:07,240 --> 02:20:12,240
The ones in the Wifi routers is no 
different in the environment other than 

3012
02:20:12,240 --> 02:20:13,400
the fact that Wifi routers were there.
Yeah,

3013
02:20:13,420 --> 02:20:14,950
that ain't good.
That's frightening.

3014
02:20:15,250 --> 02:20:20,250
It is.
Twelve days of growth and then it 

3015
02:20:20,250 --> 02:20:22,620
totally makes sense.
I mean there's a signal if your phone 

3016
02:20:22,620 --> 02:20:25,561
can pick up that signal,
there is something in the air and that 

3017
02:20:25,561 --> 02:20:27,910
something in the air is probably 
disruptive to other things that are also

3018
02:20:27,911 --> 02:20:28,420
in the air.

3019
02:20:30,430 --> 02:20:32,290
Yeah.
That's fucking up the BS.

3020
02:20:32,291 --> 02:20:33,430
What's it doing to your brain?

3021
02:20:33,650 --> 02:20:36,910
Exactly right.
It feels different man.

3022
02:20:36,970 --> 02:20:38,960
When you go to a place with no cell 
phone signal,

3023
02:20:38,961 --> 02:20:42,410
it literally feels different and it's so
rare that we do that.

3024
02:20:42,650 --> 02:20:43,940
So rare,
yeah,

3025
02:20:43,941 --> 02:20:46,190
but it's not just,
it's not just the cell phone signal.

3026
02:20:46,191 --> 02:20:50,790
I mean it's all kinds of things.
People give off a certain signal to.

3027
02:20:52,200 --> 02:20:54,860
People want to think that that's hippy 
and woo woo,

3028
02:20:54,861 --> 02:20:59,861
but man,
when you're around really negative 

3029
02:20:59,861 --> 02:20:59,990
people that are going to go away from 
this person and it's not just,

3030
02:21:00,020 --> 02:21:05,020
you got to get away from them because 
they say certain things like they give 

3031
02:21:05,020 --> 02:21:05,020
off a vibe,
you know,

3032
02:21:05,020 --> 02:21:09,250
that that's like,
that's a hippie thing to say the vibes 

3033
02:21:09,250 --> 02:21:12,230
guys giving me a bad vibe man.
But I think it's real.

3034
02:21:12,320 --> 02:21:14,420
I think there are certain rules.

3035
02:21:14,450 --> 02:21:16,270
You walk into a room and you're like,
well,

3036
02:21:16,271 --> 02:21:18,950
there's a heavy energy and you know,
there's something weird.

3037
02:21:18,951 --> 02:21:20,740
It doesn't feel right to me.
You know?

3038
02:21:20,750 --> 02:21:21,500
I got,
you get,

3039
02:21:21,560 --> 02:21:26,560
you get,
you get like anxious and you got to 

3040
02:21:26,560 --> 02:21:26,560
leave.
Yeah,

3041
02:21:26,560 --> 02:21:27,260
right.
Everybody's had that experience.

3042
02:21:27,670 --> 02:21:30,130
Well that's why nobody wants to buy a 
house where someone was killed in it.

3043
02:21:32,110 --> 02:21:37,110
The house is awesome.
You find out that there was like a 

3044
02:21:37,110 --> 02:21:37,110
double homicide there.
You're like,

3045
02:21:37,110 --> 02:21:37,780
fuck this place.

3046
02:21:37,900 --> 02:21:41,160
Have you ever been up in,
uh,

3047
02:21:41,550 --> 02:21:43,120
towards Simi?
Um,

3048
02:21:43,450 --> 02:21:46,480
that like dry lake bed in Chatsworth?
Yes.

3049
02:21:46,510 --> 02:21:48,670
What's that Canyon called?
Right there.

3050
02:21:48,671 --> 02:21:52,010
That's creepy.
I'm Tapo.

3051
02:21:52,080 --> 02:21:52,910
No,
no,

3052
02:21:53,180 --> 02:21:54,870
no.
I Dunno.

3053
02:21:55,230 --> 02:21:55,870
You know what I'm talking.
I,

3054
02:21:55,950 --> 02:21:57,580
you're talking about though,
like I've written my,

3055
02:21:57,640 --> 02:21:58,910
I ride my bike all,
you know,

3056
02:21:58,911 --> 02:22:01,240
I could do a lot of training around here
and I've written up that canyon.

3057
02:22:01,241 --> 02:22:03,340
It's a great client,
but like there's something weird,

3058
02:22:03,990 --> 02:22:08,990
you know,
you can feel like a weird energy and it 

3059
02:22:08,990 --> 02:22:08,990
turns out that box,
right?

3060
02:22:08,990 --> 02:22:09,580
Yeah,
yeah,

3061
02:22:09,581 --> 02:22:10,680
yeah.
Box Canyon.

3062
02:22:10,681 --> 02:22:11,320
Yeah.
And like,

3063
02:22:11,321 --> 02:22:13,330
um,
what's that chance and family?

3064
02:22:13,331 --> 02:22:13,690
Um,
yeah,

3065
02:22:13,691 --> 02:22:16,540
there was like the mansons were back 
there and also there are,

3066
02:22:17,110 --> 02:22:19,030
I think it's Boeing is back there.
Yes.

3067
02:22:19,090 --> 02:22:21,700
Contractors where they were doing 
nuclear testing in the ground,

3068
02:22:21,701 --> 02:22:26,070
which is why that's a dry lake bed and 
there's still people that

3069
02:22:26,070 --> 02:22:27,310
will tell you that they're,
you know,

3070
02:22:27,400 --> 02:22:29,210
it's not so safe there.
They,

3071
02:22:29,270 --> 02:22:30,900
they,
they did some shit out there,

3072
02:22:30,901 --> 02:22:35,901
you know.
Well they definitely did some shit 

3073
02:22:35,901 --> 02:22:35,901
there.
And not only that,

3074
02:22:35,901 --> 02:22:35,901
there was some in,
in seeing me,

3075
02:22:35,901 --> 02:22:39,861
there were some water well tasks that 
they did that found traces of rocket 

3076
02:22:39,931 --> 02:22:41,190
fuel in the water.
Well,

3077
02:22:41,191 --> 02:22:46,191
and there's a cleanup that's going on up
there right now is a really susanna 

3078
02:22:46,420 --> 02:22:51,420
pass.
People are worried about that clean up 

3079
02:22:51,420 --> 02:22:54,230
because they're worried about is that if
they start digging and cleaning up that 

3080
02:22:54,230 --> 02:22:58,450
the dust is going to get into the air 
and it's going to blow through the 

3081
02:22:58,450 --> 02:23:00,390
valley and whatever trace elements of 
that rocket fuel.

3082
02:23:00,600 --> 02:23:02,370
Apparently there was a lot of disasters 
up there.

3083
02:23:02,371 --> 02:23:05,070
They did a lot of shit down there in the
fifties and the sixties.

3084
02:23:05,700 --> 02:23:07,440
Early testing on stuff.
Yeah.

3085
02:23:07,441 --> 02:23:11,000
They had like some sort of a nuclear 
thing there as well.

3086
02:23:11,210 --> 02:23:16,210
Apparently there was a nuclear incidents
much worse than three miles worse than 

3087
02:23:16,591 --> 02:23:18,000
three mile island.
Really?

3088
02:23:19,920 --> 02:23:22,780
In 1959 they had something worse than 
through my own.

3089
02:23:23,100 --> 02:23:25,410
Huh?
La Apparent.

3090
02:23:25,411 --> 02:23:30,411
I read a study on it though and one of 
the things that said the study like the 

3091
02:23:30,411 --> 02:23:32,280
half life of the type of radiation that 
they have is very short lived.

3092
02:23:32,610 --> 02:23:35,250
So it's not something that lingers in an
area.

3093
02:23:35,310 --> 02:23:39,750
The real concern that the apparently 
according to what I read,

3094
02:23:40,200 --> 02:23:44,460
that the sober environmentalist are 
concerned with is the rocket fuel that's

3095
02:23:44,461 --> 02:23:48,730
leaked into the ground and gotten into 
the well water in that area.

3096
02:23:48,890 --> 02:23:50,030
That's the real concern.
Is that.

3097
02:23:50,070 --> 02:23:52,280
Is that why the lake that is dry?
I don't know.

3098
02:23:52,740 --> 02:23:54,780
I've no idea whether they pose try.
Interesting.

3099
02:23:54,850 --> 02:23:59,850
I,
I knew a dude who lived near a golf 

3100
02:23:59,850 --> 02:24:03,621
course and the pesticides from the golf 
course leaked into the well and he got 

3101
02:24:04,441 --> 02:24:04,920
cancer.

3102
02:24:05,310 --> 02:24:07,790
His neighbor guard cancer kids in his 
neighborhood.

3103
02:24:07,820 --> 02:24:09,240
It was like all throughout the 
neighborhood,

3104
02:24:09,300 --> 02:24:14,300
people got cancer,
they got cancer because of the 

3105
02:24:14,300 --> 02:24:17,091
pesticides.
Like they all got a very specific type 

3106
02:24:17,091 --> 02:24:17,091
of bone cancer.
Scary Shit.

3107
02:24:17,091 --> 02:24:22,011
Like he doesn't have a femur.
One of his femurs is like a metal rod 

3108
02:24:22,011 --> 02:24:22,710
that they replaced his femur with 
because he had cancer.

3109
02:24:22,840 --> 02:24:24,060
That's crazy.
Yeah.

3110
02:24:24,250 --> 02:24:26,970
And it's from pesticides.
There was a big class action.

3111
02:24:27,360 --> 02:24:28,140
Yeah.
I don't know.

3112
02:24:28,200 --> 02:24:30,000
I don't know what,
what the fuck went down,

3113
02:24:30,001 --> 02:24:34,380
but you know,
bone cancer from a golf course.

3114
02:24:34,740 --> 02:24:36,230
Fuck,
you know.

3115
02:24:36,480 --> 02:24:40,440
Imagine what our rocket facility they're
dumping,

3116
02:24:40,441 --> 02:24:42,660
what kind of Shit they're dumping into 
that fucking ground.

3117
02:24:43,020 --> 02:24:43,650
Kidding,
right.

3118
02:24:43,770 --> 02:24:44,460
I mean,
you know,

3119
02:24:44,461 --> 02:24:46,320
our world is getting more and more 
toxic,

3120
02:24:46,380 --> 02:24:48,060
right?
All these things we have to worry about.

3121
02:24:48,090 --> 02:24:49,170
Think about,
think about,

3122
02:24:49,171 --> 02:24:50,850
you know,
look on the back of,

3123
02:24:50,880 --> 02:24:55,880
you know,
the average package food that you pick 

3124
02:24:55,880 --> 02:24:55,880
up at the grocery store and all the 
ingredients in it and like,

3125
02:24:55,880 --> 02:24:57,390
you know,
who knows what all that stuff is,

3126
02:24:57,660 --> 02:25:02,660
whether it's safe and we're interesting 
regulatory bodies to make these 

3127
02:25:02,660 --> 02:25:03,040
decisions for us.
Right.

3128
02:25:03,090 --> 02:25:04,740
How about meditation?
Yeah,

3129
02:25:04,741 --> 02:25:05,580
of course.
Right.

3130
02:25:05,750 --> 02:25:10,750
Hold on.
New Medications are constantly coming 

3131
02:25:10,750 --> 02:25:10,750
out.
Side effects.

3132
02:25:10,750 --> 02:25:11,160
I mean the commercials are just comedic,
you know,

3133
02:25:11,180 --> 02:25:16,180
like literally way more disclosures 
about side effects than actual product 

3134
02:25:17,221 --> 02:25:18,310
information.
Yeah.

3135
02:25:18,330 --> 02:25:20,160
We played one for acne medicine the 
other day.

3136
02:25:20,161 --> 02:25:22,310
That was hilarious.
Well,

3137
02:25:22,320 --> 02:25:24,280
because there was this like suicidal,

3138
02:25:24,790 --> 02:25:27,190
not just suicide.
They were talking about bloody diarrhea.

3139
02:25:27,490 --> 02:25:30,310
They had these really pretty girls and 
they were walking down the street.

3140
02:25:30,311 --> 02:25:32,320
There were bopping.
One of the girls in that commercial,

3141
02:25:32,321 --> 02:25:34,270
the redheaded girl contacted me on 
twitter.

3142
02:25:35,470 --> 02:25:37,060
They had no idea what the fuck they were
selling,

3143
02:25:37,360 --> 02:25:38,890
you know,
they're just trying to be pretty,

3144
02:25:38,950 --> 02:25:39,410
you know,
they don't,

3145
02:25:39,490 --> 02:25:40,980
they're not talking in the commercial,
right,

3146
02:25:41,080 --> 02:25:45,250
but they're bopping down the street to 
that forelle song happy and uh,

3147
02:25:45,310 --> 02:25:50,310
they have like beautiful skin and 
beautiful hair and they're perfect bone 

3148
02:25:50,310 --> 02:25:51,340
structure and they literally like 
bopping as they're walking,

3149
02:25:51,341 --> 02:25:55,030
like they're in some happy music video.
And then as they're doing that,

3150
02:25:55,090 --> 02:26:00,090
the,
the start reading the laundry list of 

3151
02:26:00,090 --> 02:26:02,740
possible potential side effects that are
fatal bloody diarrhea,

3152
02:26:02,741 --> 02:26:04,360
stomach cramps,
all these different things.

3153
02:26:04,390 --> 02:26:09,100
And they're very specific which could be
fatal just because you're getting zits.

3154
02:26:09,340 --> 02:26:14,340
And again,
like you're saying like you're looking 

3155
02:26:14,340 --> 02:26:14,830
back on the couch watching this.
I mean we've signed up for this.

3156
02:26:14,920 --> 02:26:19,920
I mean the Orwellian dystopia and he's 
like weirder than you could've ever 

3157
02:26:19,920 --> 02:26:20,710
imagined.
Right.

3158
02:26:20,850 --> 02:26:25,850
And again,
what you were talking about earlier is 

3159
02:26:25,850 --> 02:26:28,410
you're using a medication to deal with 
an issue that if you take a holistic 

3160
02:26:28,451 --> 02:26:31,180
approach,
what's causing you to have acne,

3161
02:26:31,470 --> 02:26:36,470
right?
What is causing your skin to break out 

3162
02:26:36,470 --> 02:26:38,671
and some sort of a horrible way that you
need this fucking bloody diarrhea 

3163
02:26:38,671 --> 02:26:41,080
inducing medication to combat it?
Yeah.

3164
02:26:41,081 --> 02:26:46,081
I mean at some point you know the side 
effects far outweigh the condition that 

3165
02:26:46,091 --> 02:26:49,650
you're trying to treat and they're too 
bloody diarrhea.

3166
02:26:50,070 --> 02:26:55,070
There's.
There isn't even a single thought put 

3167
02:26:55,070 --> 02:26:58,081
into the cars.
Like why don't we talk about what might 

3168
02:26:58,081 --> 02:27:01,351
be leading to this and maybe some 
choices that you could make that could 

3169
02:27:01,351 --> 02:27:02,230
alleviate or prevent this.

3170
02:27:02,980 --> 02:27:04,510
No,
just take this.

3171
02:27:05,020 --> 02:27:10,020
Well,
you can't make any money with those 

3172
02:27:10,020 --> 02:27:10,020
choices.
Joy,

3173
02:27:10,020 --> 02:27:12,241
you're bloody diarrhea.
There's only one way to make the money 

3174
02:27:12,241 --> 02:27:15,160
was the way to make the money is you 
gotta you gotta sell the stuff.

3175
02:27:15,850 --> 02:27:20,850
You don't.
You don't make money by getting people 

3176
02:27:20,850 --> 02:27:21,340
and you can.
You can write a book book,

3177
02:27:21,490 --> 02:27:23,470
make some money.
It's not going to make us money.

3178
02:27:23,471 --> 02:27:28,471
Money is accutane or some point.
Know that Broccoli growers need to 

3179
02:27:28,471 --> 02:27:29,620
unite.
Yeah.

3180
02:27:29,630 --> 02:27:33,190
Imagine if there was like a plant that 
cured zits is one plant.

3181
02:27:33,430 --> 02:27:34,980
Boy,
would they make that plan illegal?

3182
02:27:34,990 --> 02:27:39,990
Quick crutching on all the advisors.
Profits are so,

3183
02:27:40,721 --> 02:27:41,700
yeah,
all that.

3184
02:27:42,010 --> 02:27:44,450
What is that stuff?
The benzoyl peroxide,

3185
02:27:44,451 --> 02:27:46,260
the stuff is all that money.
Oh yeah.

3186
02:27:46,340 --> 02:27:49,270
All that does is to see 10 dries your 
skin out.

3187
02:27:49,360 --> 02:27:54,360
So it does.
It's all a puskus gets dried out and 

3188
02:27:54,360 --> 02:27:55,060
your skin feels like shit.
Yeah,

3189
02:27:55,120 --> 02:27:56,120
I mean look,
you know,

3190
02:27:56,200 --> 02:28:01,180
western medicine is fantastic if you 
have an acute disorder.

3191
02:28:01,210 --> 02:28:02,410
I'm not like,
you know,

3192
02:28:02,500 --> 02:28:07,270
against Western medicine or 
pharmaceuticals when appropriate.

3193
02:28:07,300 --> 02:28:08,830
I just think that that,
you know,

3194
02:28:08,831 --> 02:28:13,831
we're too quick to take them to deal 
with things that might be better 

3195
02:28:13,831 --> 02:28:15,010
addressed in other ways.
I agree.

3196
02:28:15,011 --> 02:28:20,011
And it's also as.
Why's it have to be one of the other 

3197
02:28:20,011 --> 02:28:22,480
wise,
it has to be pharmaceutical drugs are 

3198
02:28:22,480 --> 02:28:22,480
evil or they're great.
No,

3199
02:28:22,480 --> 02:28:22,480
it's like sometimes

3200
02:28:22,480 --> 02:28:24,860
they're great and sometimes they're evil
and you know,

3201
02:28:24,861 --> 02:28:27,830
the problem is profit.
Once profit gets in the way,

3202
02:28:28,140 --> 02:28:33,140
our profit gets into the mix.
That'd becomes a soul thing you're 

3203
02:28:33,140 --> 02:28:36,281
chasing.
It's not like let's make sure that what 

3204
02:28:36,281 --> 02:28:38,540
we're doing is the most beneficial to 
society and to human beings possible.

3205
02:28:38,690 --> 02:28:43,690
No,
let's make sure we make a fuck load of 

3206
02:28:43,690 --> 02:28:46,091
money,
the most money we could possibly make 

3207
02:28:46,091 --> 02:28:48,071
because getting something passed by the 
FDA is a huge process that cost millions

3208
02:28:48,740 --> 02:28:53,740
and millions of dollars.
So by the time you actually do get a 

3209
02:28:53,740 --> 02:28:53,740
product to market you,
you,

3210
02:28:53,740 --> 02:28:55,160
you have to protect that product.
You have to protect that,

3211
02:28:55,190 --> 02:28:56,450
that money.
It's all about money,

3212
02:28:56,480 --> 02:28:58,880
money and profit.
The best thing to do is just

3213
02:28:58,980 --> 02:29:03,980
be proactive enough about your health so
that you can do whatever is under your 

3214
02:29:03,980 --> 02:29:07,230
control to prevent you from getting any 
kind of acute disease.

3215
02:29:07,260 --> 02:29:09,810
Not to say that it doesn't happen 
because of course it does,

3216
02:29:09,811 --> 02:29:10,830
but,
um,

3217
02:29:11,870 --> 02:29:13,650
you know,
I think there's lots of things that,

3218
02:29:13,710 --> 02:29:16,890
that could be more deeply explored that 
then,

3219
02:29:16,891 --> 02:29:21,891
you know,
our culture really is sort of per 

3220
02:29:21,891 --> 02:29:23,570
permittable too in kind of our,
you know,

3221
02:29:23,690 --> 02:29:25,850
what we accept as mainstream or not.
Like I,

3222
02:29:25,851 --> 02:29:29,040
I started recently a going to 
acupuncture,

3223
02:29:29,041 --> 02:29:31,800
which I'd never done before.
It was before.

3224
02:29:31,880 --> 02:29:32,340
Yeah,
I've done it.

3225
02:29:32,341 --> 02:29:32,670
No,
I didn't,

3226
02:29:32,790 --> 02:29:34,740
I didn't think it was bullshit.
I mean,

3227
02:29:34,741 --> 02:29:36,780
you know,
I'm a pretty rational guy,

3228
02:29:36,781 --> 02:29:38,160
you know,
so the idea of sticking,

3229
02:29:38,161 --> 02:29:43,161
you know,
sort of like the idea of Meridians and 

3230
02:29:43,161 --> 02:29:43,500
sticking needles into my forehead and I 
was like,

3231
02:29:43,501 --> 02:29:46,860
I didn't really know I wasn't an 
immediate,

3232
02:29:46,890 --> 02:29:48,780
you know,
somebody who's going to immediately jump

3233
02:29:48,781 --> 02:29:53,781
on that bandwagon,
but I know a lot of people who have 

3234
02:29:53,781 --> 02:29:55,080
benefited from it and I was having some 
things that I want to address,

3235
02:29:55,081 --> 02:29:56,250
like particularly sleep.

3236
02:29:56,250 --> 02:30:01,250
Like I've been challenged by sleep 
lately and so I went to see my friend 

3237
02:30:01,250 --> 02:30:04,761
who's a Chinese medicine doctor and he 
started doing it on me and it was hell.

3238
02:30:05,100 --> 02:30:07,230
It was really helpful.
It was really helpful.

3239
02:30:07,231 --> 02:30:11,340
And it's interesting,
the idea of balancing energy systems and

3240
02:30:11,370 --> 02:30:13,110
you know,
kind of how it works.

3241
02:30:13,111 --> 02:30:15,270
I mean so ornate and,
and this,

3242
02:30:15,310 --> 02:30:20,310
you know,
my friend who's studying Chinese 

3243
02:30:20,310 --> 02:30:20,310
medicine and he's still kind of in his 
residency,

3244
02:30:20,310 --> 02:30:25,221
so he's working underneath like a,
this Chinese dude who's been practicing 

3245
02:30:25,221 --> 02:30:27,260
this forever and they come in and the 
guy literally the,

3246
02:30:27,261 --> 02:30:28,080
this,
this,

3247
02:30:28,620 --> 02:30:33,330
this Chinese medicine doctor.
The only thing he wants to do is take my

3248
02:30:33,331 --> 02:30:38,331
pulse on both wrists and he,
he takes it with his thumb and a couple 

3249
02:30:38,331 --> 02:30:42,170
different places and apparently his 
touch is so finely attuned that he,

3250
02:30:42,171 --> 02:30:47,171
he can tell all kinds of things about 
like where you're at based upon the 

3251
02:30:47,171 --> 02:30:51,351
pressure of your pulse and you know,
the frequency and the tempo and all 

3252
02:30:51,351 --> 02:30:52,950
these sorts of things.
So he wants to do that and then he wants

3253
02:30:52,951 --> 02:30:53,760
to look at,
uh,

3254
02:30:53,970 --> 02:30:56,880
your tongue and he could tell by looking
at your tongue,

3255
02:30:56,881 --> 02:30:59,190
like all sorts of crazy shit about where
you're at.

3256
02:31:00,030 --> 02:31:02,400
Disney for.
Interesting people love it.

3257
02:31:02,401 --> 02:31:04,860
Or do you believe in possible placebo 
effect?

3258
02:31:05,540 --> 02:31:08,040
I think the placebo effect is powerful.
You know,

3259
02:31:08,041 --> 02:31:09,840
I'm,
I'm into trying anything,

3260
02:31:09,841 --> 02:31:10,920
you know,
why not right?

3261
02:31:10,921 --> 02:31:11,560
Like,
you know,

3262
02:31:11,580 --> 02:31:14,370
contempt prior to investigation.
That's a good way to get.

3263
02:31:15,270 --> 02:31:16,240
Get hoodwinked.
Yeah.

3264
02:31:16,241 --> 02:31:17,460
Something's got to happen.
Well,

3265
02:31:17,461 --> 02:31:19,940
I mean I think with,
but

3266
02:31:20,430 --> 02:31:25,430
is that better than saying I'm not going
to explore that because I think it's bs 

3267
02:31:25,430 --> 02:31:29,270
without having any direct experience.
But I mean it's nice to have some sort 

3268
02:31:29,270 --> 02:31:29,650
of proof something.
So how do you,

3269
02:31:29,790 --> 02:31:31,950
how do you,
how do you prove that,

3270
02:31:32,330 --> 02:31:33,930
you know,
you run some tests,

3271
02:31:35,190 --> 02:31:38,610
some tests on what have the guy proved 
that they can actually do that?

3272
02:31:38,640 --> 02:31:39,300
Oh yeah.
Well,

3273
02:31:39,301 --> 02:31:44,301
I mean all I can tell you is that I was 
having issues with sleep and relaxation 

3274
02:31:44,301 --> 02:31:47,640
and this seemed to benefit and alleviate
my problem to some extent.

3275
02:31:47,720 --> 02:31:51,390
So we don't use that placebo is that the
herbs that he prescribed me,

3276
02:31:51,391 --> 02:31:56,391
is that the acupuncture?
It certainly could be those things 

3277
02:31:56,391 --> 02:31:56,391
because you've got to think about like 
sleep.

3278
02:31:56,391 --> 02:32:01,160
Oftentimes a psychological.
Oftentimes sleep is a matter of your 

3279
02:32:01,160 --> 02:32:04,761
ability to relax and we've all been in 
that situation before when you know you 

3280
02:32:04,761 --> 02:32:04,830
have to be at work and five hours.

3281
02:32:05,150 --> 02:32:10,150
If I go to sleep right now,
I can get four hours sleep and you look 

3282
02:32:10,150 --> 02:32:10,530
at that clock and for whatever reason 
you,

3283
02:32:10,590 --> 02:32:15,590
you're stuck in that thing because you 
know that you have to go to sleep right 

3284
02:32:15,590 --> 02:32:17,280
this moment and the pressure of that 
keeps you awake.

3285
02:32:17,310 --> 02:32:22,310
Even if you're tired.
If you take action to try to alleviate 

3286
02:32:22,310 --> 02:32:23,050
that by acupuncture,
by water,

3287
02:32:23,370 --> 02:32:24,700
whatever it is,
they just,

3288
02:32:24,950 --> 02:32:29,950
the mere act of taking action will shift
your focus into a cure and you can 

3289
02:32:30,570 --> 02:32:34,290
oftentimes start thinking that whatever 
this placebo effect is real,

3290
02:32:34,410 --> 02:32:37,730
I'm not doubting that this guy has a 
real app,

3291
02:32:37,731 --> 02:32:42,731
a possible a gift or whatever it is,
but wouldn't it be nice that we can 

3292
02:32:42,731 --> 02:32:43,320
prove it?
Like,

3293
02:32:43,350 --> 02:32:48,350
wouldn't you want to prove that?
What do you want to just work with a 

3294
02:32:48,350 --> 02:32:48,350
bunch of people and find out,
uh Oh look,

3295
02:32:48,350 --> 02:32:48,720
you know,
he's right.

3296
02:32:48,720 --> 02:32:51,000
This guy doesn't have a gallbladder 
issue where he's right,

3297
02:32:51,001 --> 02:32:56,001
this guy does.
I just met a lot of fuckers doing your 

3298
02:32:56,001 --> 02:33:00,141
zone of healers and all these becoming a
much more cynical about this kind of 

3299
02:33:00,141 --> 02:33:01,500
stuff.
Even before that,

3300
02:33:01,501 --> 02:33:06,501
I.
There was a guy that was working with 

3301
02:33:06,501 --> 02:33:06,501
all these mma guys that I know and it 
was a zone healer and a,

3302
02:33:07,050 --> 02:33:12,050
he would press the back of your head and
tell you from the spots that he was 

3303
02:33:12,050 --> 02:33:13,610
pressing what was wrong with you and 
that.

3304
02:33:13,630 --> 02:33:14,700
But it was bullshit.
Like he,

3305
02:33:14,810 --> 02:33:16,350
he was like,
press harder here.

3306
02:33:16,351 --> 02:33:17,490
Does that hurt when I do that?
I'm like,

3307
02:33:17,491 --> 02:33:19,110
yeah,
because you press in harder stupid.

3308
02:33:19,630 --> 02:33:21,690
I'm dumb.
And like we had this conversation.

3309
02:33:21,691 --> 02:33:22,310
I'm like,
how is it?

3310
02:33:22,470 --> 02:33:24,600
How exactly is this working?
And he was like,

3311
02:33:24,601 --> 02:33:29,601
well,
your body's ability to heal itself is 

3312
02:33:29,601 --> 02:33:30,060
dependent upon freeing your energy and 
is how does that work?

3313
02:33:30,060 --> 02:33:31,260
How does that work?
How does that work?

3314
02:33:31,380 --> 02:33:33,930
And after badgering them with a bunch of
different questions,

3315
02:33:33,931 --> 02:33:36,120
the essentially admitted it was all 
placebo effect.

3316
02:33:36,640 --> 02:33:41,640
I was like Jesus fucking Christ,
and he was charging like 160 bucks to 

3317
02:33:41,640 --> 02:33:42,410
get adjusted and he would touch your 
head.

3318
02:33:42,640 --> 02:33:45,630
Was this part of your show or to do 
that?

3319
02:33:45,631 --> 02:33:50,631
I knew that was in the mixed martial 
arts world who was dealing with all 

3320
02:33:50,631 --> 02:33:53,040
these different fighters and Jujitsu 
guys that had back injuries,

3321
02:33:53,041 --> 02:33:56,340
neck and it was a good chiropractor,
but this zone healing thing,

3322
02:33:56,341 --> 02:33:58,440
as he was getting into it,
the more I would like listen to it,

3323
02:33:58,441 --> 02:33:58,890
I was like,
okay,

3324
02:33:58,891 --> 02:34:00,050
what?
What do you.

3325
02:34:00,120 --> 02:34:05,120
You're telling me you could touch the 
back of someone's head and press spots 

3326
02:34:05,120 --> 02:34:07,230
and tell if they have a thyroid 
condition the fuck out of here.

3327
02:34:07,470 --> 02:34:09,420
That's not true.
That's just not true,

3328
02:34:09,600 --> 02:34:11,700
and he kind of admitted it wasn't true.

3329
02:34:12,000 --> 02:34:17,000
He kind of admitted that ultimately what
he's doing is if you believe in what 

3330
02:34:17,000 --> 02:34:19,350
he's doing,
it will fix what,

3331
02:34:19,430 --> 02:34:23,650
what you have this wrong with you 
because ultimately there's another great

3332
02:34:23,710 --> 02:34:28,710
a radiolab podcast on a placebo effect 
and there was one of them where they 

3333
02:34:30,191 --> 02:34:35,191
were talking about this guy.
They hypnotized this kid with this 

3334
02:34:35,191 --> 02:34:37,160
insane work problem,
skin warts.

3335
02:34:37,161 --> 02:34:42,161
So if you've ever seen people that have 
worked all over their skin where they 

3336
02:34:42,161 --> 02:34:45,091
become,
it becomes incurable by medication and 

3337
02:34:45,091 --> 02:34:48,481
they convinced this kid that they had 
hypnotized him and that it was going to 

3338
02:34:48,481 --> 02:34:53,011
go away and it went away on his arm.
His arm was like completely free of 

3339
02:34:53,011 --> 02:34:53,110
warts,
which has never happens.

3340
02:34:53,350 --> 02:34:58,350
When someone reaches such an acute level
of infection like this kid had and so 

3341
02:34:59,991 --> 02:35:01,030
in.
In a sense,

3342
02:35:01,480 --> 02:35:06,480
it is real in a sense.
It's not who he is as long as you're 

3343
02:35:06,480 --> 02:35:10,920
gullible,
as long as you're willing to 

3344
02:35:10,920 --> 02:35:13,630
wholeheartedly jump in and believe it,
and I think that might be what's going 

3345
02:35:13,630 --> 02:35:14,800
on with acupuncture.

3346
02:35:14,950 --> 02:35:19,950
That might be what's going on with a lot
of quote unquote Chinese medicine or 

3347
02:35:19,950 --> 02:35:23,821
eastern medicine.
I think if you believe that they have 

3348
02:35:23,821 --> 02:35:27,301
found you a cure,
your body starts producing whatever it 

3349
02:35:27,301 --> 02:35:32,220
actually needs to fix whatever ailment 
you have and thus it becomes actually 

3350
02:35:32,220 --> 02:35:35,470
effective.
So the the method is not correct.

3351
02:35:35,740 --> 02:35:40,740
The method is a trick and that trick is 
effective and that effective trick does 

3352
02:35:41,981 --> 02:35:46,981
convince your brain to fix whatever the 
problem is and it's really baffling and 

3353
02:35:47,230 --> 02:35:52,230
it only works if you're not a discerning
critical person because if you're a 

3354
02:35:52,230 --> 02:35:57,151
discerning person who's skeptical,
it's not going to work because then 

3355
02:35:57,151 --> 02:36:00,211
you're going to hyper analyze whatever 
it is or where the potential 

3356
02:36:00,211 --> 02:36:01,870
possibilities of whatever it is and it 
just won't.

3357
02:36:01,900 --> 02:36:04,120
It won't work,
which is weird.

3358
02:36:04,510 --> 02:36:09,510
There's no shortage of snake oil 
salesman pitching all kinds of crazy 

3359
02:36:09,510 --> 02:36:10,630
healing techniques,
you know,

3360
02:36:10,660 --> 02:36:13,060
no doubt.
But I think that in fairness,

3361
02:36:13,090 --> 02:36:18,090
you know,
acupuncture and traditions of Chinese 

3362
02:36:18,090 --> 02:36:18,090
medicine east go back,
you know,

3363
02:36:18,090 --> 02:36:19,740
hundreds if not thousands of years,
which critique there.

3364
02:36:19,810 --> 02:36:21,190
Well,
so does slavery.

3365
02:36:21,210 --> 02:36:26,210
Yeah.
But people are not going to see 

3366
02:36:26,210 --> 02:36:26,390
witchcraft doctors in west La.
Well they wouldn't believe.

3367
02:36:26,400 --> 02:36:28,720
So I think that it would,
I think that the,

3368
02:36:28,730 --> 02:36:31,630
the history and the,
the sort of,

3369
02:36:31,680 --> 02:36:33,220
um,
traditions behind it,

3370
02:36:33,280 --> 02:36:35,500
there is,
there is merit there is there though.

3371
02:36:35,501 --> 02:36:37,520
But one scientifically,
I don't know.

3372
02:36:37,530 --> 02:36:39,280
I mean I'm the wrong guy to ask about 
that.

3373
02:36:39,281 --> 02:36:41,710
I think if you're the wrong guy to ask 
about that,

3374
02:36:41,711 --> 02:36:43,120
you're probably the wrong guy to talk 
about it.

3375
02:36:43,660 --> 02:36:44,530
Yeah,
probably.

3376
02:36:44,560 --> 02:36:45,700
Yeah,
probably.

3377
02:36:46,630 --> 02:36:48,910
But I think it's,
I mean,

3378
02:36:48,911 --> 02:36:49,480
listen,
you know,

3379
02:36:49,481 --> 02:36:51,420
I just know from my friend who's been 
studying as me,

3380
02:36:51,421 --> 02:36:54,340
he's been in school for crazy long 
periods of time.

3381
02:36:54,341 --> 02:36:56,320
But you say school,
do you do air quotes?

3382
02:36:57,040 --> 02:36:57,880
I think it's,
you know,

3383
02:36:57,890 --> 02:37:01,660
it's essentially like medical school was
nothing like medical school.

3384
02:37:01,661 --> 02:37:03,400
How about that are sticking needles in 
people,

3385
02:37:03,420 --> 02:37:08,420
enlightened insights that in terms of 
like studying physiology and studying 

3386
02:37:08,420 --> 02:37:09,250
chemistry and organic chemistry and all 
that kinds of.

3387
02:37:09,670 --> 02:37:14,070
It was like on Energy Meridians and 
shock rose and all that jazz.

3388
02:37:14,071 --> 02:37:14,520
Right.
I mean,

3389
02:37:14,521 --> 02:37:16,010
isn't that like what it's based on?

3390
02:37:16,520 --> 02:37:18,800
There's some aspects of that.
Sure.

3391
02:37:18,801 --> 02:37:20,960
But there's a lot of herbal medicine.
I think too,

3392
02:37:21,350 --> 02:37:26,350
you know,
for whatever reason I thought you said 

3393
02:37:26,350 --> 02:37:26,810
urban medicine now,
you know,

3394
02:37:27,040 --> 02:37:30,730
verbal or the study of herbs.
There's,

3395
02:37:31,370 --> 02:37:34,640
there's certainly some herbs that have 
medicinal values.

3396
02:37:34,641 --> 02:37:39,641
One of my favorite herbs has massive 
amounts of manipulate Oregano marijuana,

3397
02:37:42,760 --> 02:37:47,760
the.
But I just think that the sticking the 

3398
02:37:47,760 --> 02:37:50,111
needles in you,
it's probably more that you're doing 

3399
02:37:50,111 --> 02:37:53,501
something,
you're doing something to deal with it 

3400
02:37:53,501 --> 02:37:53,501
and then doing something your body 
reacts.

3401
02:37:53,830 --> 02:37:58,830
You know,
the weirdest thing that is kind of half 

3402
02:37:58,830 --> 02:38:01,631
of what like sort of psychotherapy is to
the willingness to show up for it is to 

3403
02:38:02,241 --> 02:38:05,960
walk through the door and to engage 
somebody else is almost,

3404
02:38:06,080 --> 02:38:07,790
you know,
no doubt.

3405
02:38:07,820 --> 02:38:09,260
Half the battle.
Yeah,

3406
02:38:09,290 --> 02:38:11,330
no doubt.
There's definitely merit to that.

3407
02:38:11,390 --> 02:38:12,770
I mean,
and also like I said,

3408
02:38:12,771 --> 02:38:14,860
like the idea of any,
you know,

3409
02:38:14,930 --> 02:38:17,480
fill in the blank whenever type of 
modality,

3410
02:38:17,481 --> 02:38:19,820
any type of therapy that's actually 
effective,

3411
02:38:19,821 --> 02:38:22,490
even though it doesn't have any real 
scientific basis to it,

3412
02:38:22,910 --> 02:38:25,850
the,
the effect is still real.

3413
02:38:25,850 --> 02:38:29,180
You still get a benefit from it.
Like this zone healing shit.

3414
02:38:29,181 --> 02:38:31,430
Like if you believe in it,
it will affect you,

3415
02:38:32,000 --> 02:38:37,000
which is kind of fucking crazy.
It's kind of crazy that in some ways 

3416
02:38:37,430 --> 02:38:40,100
there's merit to it.
Well,

3417
02:38:40,101 --> 02:38:44,300
I mean let's just talk about meditation 
and Mindfulness Practices,

3418
02:38:44,360 --> 02:38:49,360
right?
So if you want to apply your sort of 

3419
02:38:49,360 --> 02:38:52,300
analytical perspective to that,
you can draw the same conclusions and 

3420
02:38:52,300 --> 02:38:53,240
really I could tell you,
well,

3421
02:38:53,241 --> 02:38:53,870
I mean,
listen,

3422
02:38:54,320 --> 02:38:58,010
anybody who is a consistent who has a 
consistent meditation practice will tell

3423
02:38:58,011 --> 02:39:00,170
you that it improves their life.
Right?

3424
02:39:00,171 --> 02:39:04,460
But do you know that a placebo,
like is there a provable,

3425
02:39:04,520 --> 02:39:06,570
you know,
thing that you sort of,

3426
02:39:06,590 --> 02:39:09,220
could you apply that same?
Um,

3427
02:39:09,400 --> 02:39:14,400
you know,
litmus test to that because this is 

3428
02:39:14,400 --> 02:39:16,610
another sort of non western approach to,
you know,

3429
02:39:17,240 --> 02:39:22,240
being healthier.
But there's been a lot of studies done 

3430
02:39:22,240 --> 02:39:22,240
on meditation.

3431
02:39:22,240 --> 02:39:24,580
I'm sure there's been a lot of studies 
done on the effectiveness of mindfulness

3432
02:39:24,581 --> 02:39:28,850
and and the actual effect on the mind,
but it's in a theoretical thing,

3433
02:39:28,910 --> 02:39:31,400
right?
Yes,

3434
02:39:31,760 --> 02:39:36,760
but it's not lying to you.
It's not saying that this frog potion 

3435
02:39:36,760 --> 02:39:41,591
that I give you is going to cure your 
cancer and then your body cures the 

3436
02:39:41,591 --> 02:39:44,321
cancer.
There's a certain aspect of meditation 

3437
02:39:44,321 --> 02:39:45,500
that's undeniably beneficial,
but that,

3438
02:39:45,530 --> 02:39:50,530
that,
that aspect of it is really been 

3439
02:39:50,530 --> 02:39:53,051
scientifically analyze.
They've done all these f MRI scans on 

3440
02:39:53,051 --> 02:39:55,520
people that are Buddhist monks that have
spent years and years meditation.

3441
02:39:55,521 --> 02:39:58,880
They've done scans on people that were 
in,

3442
02:39:58,900 --> 02:40:03,900
you know,
deep rem sleep and different stages of 

3443
02:40:03,900 --> 02:40:03,900
the mind.
I mean,

3444
02:40:03,900 --> 02:40:07,721
there's.
There's a lot of scientific work that's 

3445
02:40:07,721 --> 02:40:09,970
been done on what we call meditation,
achieving certain brainwaves,

3446
02:40:09,980 --> 02:40:13,190
achieving certain states.
Those aren't fake

3447
02:40:14,010 --> 02:40:18,120
and in a sense,
placebo effect isn't fake either,

3448
02:40:18,121 --> 02:40:23,121
right?
Because every drug that that exists 

3449
02:40:23,121 --> 02:40:25,770
exists because there's a receptive for 
it in the human mind.

3450
02:40:25,950 --> 02:40:30,950
The reason why those drugs are effective
is because the mind knows how to 

3451
02:40:30,950 --> 02:40:33,360
actually produce that effect in some 
sort of limited quantity on its own.

3452
02:40:33,720 --> 02:40:36,060
That's one of the reasons why placebo 
effects work.

3453
02:40:36,480 --> 02:40:38,880
That's the reason why we have opiate 
receptors,

3454
02:40:39,030 --> 02:40:44,030
cannabinoid receptors and all these 
different things and processes that the 

3455
02:40:44,030 --> 02:40:47,310
mind can engage in with or without 
medication.

3456
02:40:47,311 --> 02:40:50,070
That's why those medications have an 
effect on the body,

3457
02:40:50,071 --> 02:40:52,740
so in that sense,
placebos,

3458
02:40:53,370 --> 02:40:57,210
if you believe in them work,
there was really is something is there,

3459
02:40:57,300 --> 02:41:00,360
isn't it even more than that though,
like the placebo effect works.

3460
02:41:00,390 --> 02:41:02,820
Even when you know it's a placebo 
sometimes,

3461
02:41:02,880 --> 02:41:04,760
right?
Sometimes we're not as much.

3462
02:41:05,370 --> 02:41:06,260
There was,
yeah.

3463
02:41:06,630 --> 02:41:11,630
Yeah,
there was and that's I think what we're 

3464
02:41:11,630 --> 02:41:11,630
talking about.

3465
02:41:11,630 --> 02:41:14,720
Just doing something.
The act of doing something to deal with 

3466
02:41:14,720 --> 02:41:16,230
it makes you focus on whatever the issue
is.

3467
02:41:16,840 --> 02:41:21,840
You know,
I mean how many issues that people have 

3468
02:41:21,840 --> 02:41:24,471
health wise or just due to a complete 
lack of awareness of their physical 

3469
02:41:24,471 --> 02:41:28,461
body.
Just stumbling through life on this 

3470
02:41:28,461 --> 02:41:31,810
drunk and momentum of coffee and donuts 
and stress and cigarettes and traffic 

3471
02:41:33,241 --> 02:41:35,830
and pollution and stress and cigarettes 
and coffee,

3472
02:41:35,840 --> 02:41:36,870
coughing,
da bum ba bum,

3473
02:41:36,880 --> 02:41:37,180
bum,
bum,

3474
02:41:37,181 --> 02:41:37,520
bum,
bum.

3475
02:41:37,770 --> 02:41:42,770
And then just the,
just the mere act of taking the time to 

3476
02:41:42,770 --> 02:41:45,900
reassess,
like what it means to be a person to,

3477
02:41:45,960 --> 02:41:50,270
to just stop and pause and give thought 
to your,

3478
02:41:50,271 --> 02:41:55,271
your day to day existence might be 
enough to reset a lot of the processes 

3479
02:41:56,041 --> 02:41:57,240
that are in place.
Yeah,

3480
02:41:57,490 --> 02:42:00,310
I mean it's been huge in my life.
I mean,

3481
02:42:00,640 --> 02:42:04,030
it's so counterintuitive.
Like I would rather go out and do a four

3482
02:42:04,031 --> 02:42:09,031
hour run and sit down for 20 minutes in 
the morning before I leave the house 

3483
02:42:09,031 --> 02:42:09,400
and,
and engage in that practice.

3484
02:42:10,030 --> 02:42:15,030
And you know,
over the last six or eight months I've 

3485
02:42:15,030 --> 02:42:15,180
really kind of dedicated myself to it in
a,

3486
02:42:15,181 --> 02:42:15,820
in a,
in a,

3487
02:42:17,380 --> 02:42:18,820
you know,
by prioritizing it.

3488
02:42:18,821 --> 02:42:21,610
And it's really,
it has been great.

3489
02:42:21,790 --> 02:42:23,140
What do you do?
How do you do it?

3490
02:42:23,280 --> 02:42:24,460
Um,
you know,

3491
02:42:24,461 --> 02:42:29,461
I've played around with so many 
different techniques over the years and 

3492
02:42:29,461 --> 02:42:29,680
you know,
you were talking about momentum earlier,

3493
02:42:29,710 --> 02:42:34,710
right?
Like I've never been able to like hit 

3494
02:42:34,710 --> 02:42:34,710
momentum with it,
like I'll do it for a couple of days,

3495
02:42:34,710 --> 02:42:39,061
this version,
that version and I could never find a 

3496
02:42:39,061 --> 02:42:39,061
way to really stick with it.

3497
02:42:40,990 --> 02:42:45,820
And I downloaded the headspace app which
has an iphone APP.

3498
02:42:45,821 --> 02:42:49,870
It's got guided meditation programs on 
it and it started by this dude,

3499
02:42:49,930 --> 02:42:54,930
Andy Puddicombe who have had on my 
podcast recently because I became so 

3500
02:42:54,930 --> 02:42:58,441
fascinated with this guy and they're 
very easy to follow a and I put it like 

3501
02:43:00,491 --> 02:43:01,570
down in the dock,
you know,

3502
02:43:01,571 --> 02:43:06,571
like the bottom menu of my iphone.
So I see it in the morning and it's 

3503
02:43:06,571 --> 02:43:11,101
super simple app and you just open it up
and it's got a whole series of programs 

3504
02:43:11,101 --> 02:43:13,300
that you can do and I just the earbuds 
in and he just kind of talks you through

3505
02:43:13,301 --> 02:43:18,301
it.
So he takes the thinking out of it and 

3506
02:43:18,301 --> 02:43:18,301
it just makes it easy and I've been able
just,

3507
02:43:18,301 --> 02:43:23,070
just something about the ease of that.
I guess I've been able to kind of just 

3508
02:43:23,070 --> 02:43:25,090
do it and create momentum around it and 
like anything else,

3509
02:43:25,091 --> 02:43:28,660
once you have momentum and once you 
start to see the benefits of it,

3510
02:43:28,690 --> 02:43:31,540
then you're more enthusiastic about 
pursuing it further.

3511
02:43:31,850 --> 02:43:33,700
Um,
and it's been cool and this guy is,

3512
02:43:33,880 --> 02:43:35,410
he's really,
he's a cool dude.

3513
02:43:35,411 --> 02:43:39,490
He a British dude and he was in college,
dropped out of college.

3514
02:43:39,491 --> 02:43:40,690
You,
Andy Puddicombe,

3515
02:43:41,830 --> 02:43:45,310
Pud d I c o m,
b e a.

3516
02:43:45,340 --> 02:43:50,340
He has a great ted talk by the way,
but I grew up in London and dropped out 

3517
02:43:52,091 --> 02:43:56,530
of college and what's in Nepal and 
started studying buddhist meditation and

3518
02:43:56,531 --> 02:44:01,120
became a Buddhist monk and he lived 
basically in relative seclusion for like

3519
02:44:01,121 --> 02:44:06,121
10 years as a Buddhist monk practicing 
meditation and that he had this kind of 

3520
02:44:06,121 --> 02:44:08,470
postmodern said a moment where he 
realized like,

3521
02:44:08,490 --> 02:44:10,360
you know,
I need to go back to the west.

3522
02:44:10,960 --> 02:44:15,280
He had this calling to come back and be 
a teacher and he started this company,

3523
02:44:15,281 --> 02:44:16,840
headspace,
that's become huge.

3524
02:44:16,841 --> 02:44:19,270
They've got like over a million 
subscribers on this app.

3525
02:44:19,460 --> 02:44:22,180
He's developed this huge business around
it and he's very accessible.

3526
02:44:22,360 --> 02:44:25,870
He's friendly and engaging and very 
modern and you know,

3527
02:44:25,871 --> 02:44:27,300
he sort of like,
where's live?

3528
02:44:27,760 --> 02:44:29,800
He lives here in Venice now.
He moved from London.

3529
02:44:29,801 --> 02:44:31,480
He lives here in Venice.
Schooldude.

3530
02:44:32,080 --> 02:44:33,500
Yeah,
there is his.

3531
02:44:33,730 --> 02:44:36,730
And then he um,
right before he wants,

3532
02:44:36,790 --> 02:44:38,680
once he decided he wasn't going to be a 
monk anymore.

3533
02:44:38,740 --> 02:44:43,300
And before he kind of returned west,
he studied circus arts at the Moscow,

3534
02:44:43,480 --> 02:44:47,020
like college of circus and then went to 
a concert.

3535
02:44:47,021 --> 02:44:48,550
Yeah,
like he became like a Spain,

3536
02:44:48,551 --> 02:44:48,970
like,
no,

3537
02:44:48,971 --> 02:44:51,940
like the,
like Cirque de Solei type stuff.

3538
02:44:52,300 --> 02:44:55,330
So he's got like this crazy skillset and
during his ted talk,

3539
02:44:55,331 --> 02:44:57,320
he's like juggling the whole time.
Really?

3540
02:44:57,540 --> 02:44:58,660
He's,
he's cool dude.

3541
02:44:59,460 --> 02:45:04,460
What,
what benefits have you found from this 

3542
02:45:04,460 --> 02:45:06,660
meditation?
The biggest thing that I've found is 

3543
02:45:06,660 --> 02:45:06,660
that,
um,

3544
02:45:06,660 --> 02:45:10,810
I'm able to navigate stressful 
situations much more gracefully.

3545
02:45:11,170 --> 02:45:13,520
I'm far less reactive,
uh,

3546
02:45:13,540 --> 02:45:17,410
to people I'm able to kind of calmly 
take information out,

3547
02:45:17,440 --> 02:45:22,440
engage it,
and then respond more mindfully and I'm 

3548
02:45:22,440 --> 02:45:22,480
able to,
you know,

3549
02:45:22,481 --> 02:45:24,370
I've got a lot of stuff going on right 
now is like,

3550
02:45:24,400 --> 02:45:25,250
you know,
it's just.

3551
02:45:25,700 --> 02:45:30,700
And to be able to kind of not get 
anxious over that and just be able to 

3552
02:45:30,700 --> 02:45:30,700
say,
okay,

3553
02:45:30,700 --> 02:45:32,350
you know,
focus on one thing at a time and not get

3554
02:45:32,351 --> 02:45:35,060
worked up about the smaller stuff.
Um,

3555
02:45:35,470 --> 02:45:40,470
and just ultimately a much more 
productive and constructive in my 

3556
02:45:40,470 --> 02:45:44,671
interactions with other people focused 
when I'm working present with my wife 

3557
02:45:44,671 --> 02:45:48,970
and my kids and calmer and it's impacted
my sleep as well.

3558
02:45:48,971 --> 02:45:49,990
It's been,
it's been cool.

3559
02:45:50,200 --> 02:45:52,320
I mean it's been,
you know,

3560
02:45:53,200 --> 02:45:55,930
I think the benefits,
I've exceeded what I expected.

3561
02:45:55,960 --> 02:45:56,740
I don't know how,
you know,

3562
02:45:56,741 --> 02:45:59,350
I didn't expect it to be any crazy 
difference,

3563
02:45:59,351 --> 02:46:01,390
but it's been really great and it's sort
of like,

3564
02:46:01,391 --> 02:46:06,391
it's powerful too to be able to kind of 
stand in your space and not get rattled 

3565
02:46:06,760 --> 02:46:10,010
by things like that's a pretty potent 
sort of

3566
02:46:10,010 --> 02:46:12,890
skill to develop.
Like just imagine yourself,

3567
02:46:14,990 --> 02:46:16,070
you know,
you're at work,

3568
02:46:16,100 --> 02:46:21,080
your boss is coming at you,
he accuses you of unfairly if something.

3569
02:46:21,081 --> 02:46:21,760
And you know,
what do you do?

3570
02:46:21,880 --> 02:46:24,440
Your like your buttons are pushed.
Like you're on autopilot,

3571
02:46:24,441 --> 02:46:29,441
you react in a certain way.
But to be able to like reprogram 

3572
02:46:29,441 --> 02:46:29,660
yourself and go,
oh,

3573
02:46:29,661 --> 02:46:31,070
I have a choice here,
you know,

3574
02:46:31,100 --> 02:46:33,470
my brain is saying this,
but you know,

3575
02:46:33,500 --> 02:46:38,500
I don't have to engage in that pattern.
I can actually tell a different story 

3576
02:46:38,990 --> 02:46:41,210
and react in a different way.
I think that's a,

3577
02:46:41,450 --> 02:46:45,230
that's a pretty powerful life skill 
that's worth developing.

3578
02:46:45,540 --> 02:46:46,520
Yeah,
no doubt.

3579
02:46:46,521 --> 02:46:47,000
No doubt.

3580
02:46:47,430 --> 02:46:48,670
That's very cool.
I'm gonna.

3581
02:46:48,690 --> 02:46:51,720
Look into that and I'm definitely going 
to download that APP and check out him.

3582
02:46:51,750 --> 02:46:53,360
That's,
that's fascinating stuff.

3583
02:46:53,361 --> 02:46:56,070
It's good stuff.
Do you ever fuck around with the sensory

3584
02:46:56,071 --> 02:46:56,910
deprivation tank?

3585
02:46:57,900 --> 02:47:00,270
I've been wanting to do that for so 
long.

3586
02:47:00,390 --> 02:47:02,520
I want to go to the float lab and 
Venice.

3587
02:47:02,580 --> 02:47:04,920
I've got a friend who's got a tank.
I know you're big into that.

3588
02:47:04,921 --> 02:47:06,270
I know that.
I would really dig it.

3589
02:47:06,420 --> 02:47:07,500
You have a tank?
Yeah,

3590
02:47:07,580 --> 02:47:08,550
yeah.
Yeah.

3591
02:47:08,551 --> 02:47:10,080
So you know,
what are the.

3592
02:47:10,200 --> 02:47:12,270
You probably talked about this a ton on 
your show already,

3593
02:47:12,271 --> 02:47:15,930
but like what if you could like 
encapsulate the benefits of that

3594
02:47:16,600 --> 02:47:19,150
removes the mind from the body,
the,

3595
02:47:19,390 --> 02:47:24,390
the influence of the body and all the 
stimuli of the world arose.

3596
02:47:24,800 --> 02:47:27,920
It evaporates.
Rather it just it.

3597
02:47:28,440 --> 02:47:33,330
It's the mine untethered from the body 
in a very weird way and the way I always

3598
02:47:33,340 --> 02:47:35,350
describe it as if we were having this 
conversation,

3599
02:47:35,351 --> 02:47:40,351
but right next door,
so you have people screaming at the top 

3600
02:47:40,351 --> 02:47:40,351
of their lungs will be very distracting.
We would want to go,

3601
02:47:40,351 --> 02:47:44,350
let's go talk over here and that.
That screaming is information.

3602
02:47:44,351 --> 02:47:49,351
It's stimuli stimulus you.
You're constantly getting it right now 

3603
02:47:49,351 --> 02:47:53,911
where we're sitting in,
even though these are very comfortable 

3604
02:47:53,911 --> 02:47:54,520
or Ergonomic chairs from the Ergo depot,
cut Pisco chairs.

3605
02:47:55,070 --> 02:47:57,460
Very good for your posture.
I used to fucking these.

3606
02:47:57,740 --> 02:48:00,550
I used my package to kill me at the end 
of every show,

3607
02:48:00,740 --> 02:48:03,040
but because of these chairs,
it's really fantastic,

3608
02:48:03,041 --> 02:48:05,110
but it's still.
You're still in a chair.

3609
02:48:05,110 --> 02:48:08,560
You're ass is pushing against it.
You feel the weight of your body.

3610
02:48:08,770 --> 02:48:10,250
You're moving around.
There's.

3611
02:48:10,660 --> 02:48:12,940
There's a desk in front of you.
We have visual cues.

3612
02:48:12,941 --> 02:48:14,770
We're hearing things.
We have earphones on.

3613
02:48:14,771 --> 02:48:19,771
There's all stuff that's going on 
constantly that we look at it as the 

3614
02:48:19,771 --> 02:48:21,040
world,
but it really what it is is data.

3615
02:48:21,130 --> 02:48:26,130
It's data coming into your brain that 
your brain has to process and that data 

3616
02:48:26,130 --> 02:48:28,780
life itself is a distraction in that 
tank.

3617
02:48:28,810 --> 02:48:33,810
There is no data there.
You mean you have a very limited amount 

3618
02:48:33,810 --> 02:48:36,040
of sensation of the fact that you were 
in water that will eventually go away.

3619
02:48:36,041 --> 02:48:38,840
If you stay still long enough,
the water's the same temperatures,

3620
02:48:38,860 --> 02:48:43,860
your skin,
so you will get to a point where you 

3621
02:48:43,860 --> 02:48:46,351
don't feel it.
There's a thousand pounds of salt in 

3622
02:48:46,351 --> 02:48:46,351
that water,
so you'll.

3623
02:48:46,351 --> 02:48:50,160
You'll float effortlessly and you're in 
total darkness and as long as there's no

3624
02:48:51,131 --> 02:48:54,520
bang around the room,
as long as you're in a good silent area,

3625
02:48:55,000 --> 02:49:00,000
you will experience quiet in a way that 
is you never get.

3626
02:49:01,030 --> 02:49:06,030
You will experience physical quiet.
You will be no input and the absence of 

3627
02:49:06,030 --> 02:49:08,100
that input,
your brain becomes supercharged.

3628
02:49:08,160 --> 02:49:12,480
It makes it so much easier for me to 
understand influences,

3629
02:49:12,510 --> 02:49:17,510
objectives,
all the things that I had been pushing 

3630
02:49:17,510 --> 02:49:20,601
to the back of my brain,
avoiding come to light instantaneously 

3631
02:49:20,601 --> 02:49:21,400
highlighted,
uh,

3632
02:49:21,420 --> 02:49:23,430
all issues become highlighted.
Any,

3633
02:49:23,431 --> 02:49:25,320
any stumbling blocks,
any,

3634
02:49:25,321 --> 02:49:30,321
any things that you really need to 
address all come to the forefront and 

3635
02:49:30,321 --> 02:49:34,700
the way I describe it as the first 20 
minutes or so seem like,

3636
02:49:35,930 --> 02:49:40,230
like a seminar on my life,
like my life is being explained to me.

3637
02:49:40,231 --> 02:49:40,860
Like,
here's,

3638
02:49:41,130 --> 02:49:45,960
if I went to a guru that could explain 
to me in no uncertain terms,

3639
02:49:45,961 --> 02:49:48,360
like someone who really knows every 
aspect of my life.

3640
02:49:48,361 --> 02:49:53,361
Like if you could plug a USB drive into 
my head into some super computer that 

3641
02:49:53,361 --> 02:49:54,120
can fix things,
they'd go,

3642
02:49:54,121 --> 02:49:54,450
oh,
well,

3643
02:49:54,451 --> 02:49:57,720
look at all these issues you have.
You have to get rid of this,

3644
02:49:58,260 --> 02:49:59,460
clean out,
this clutter,

3645
02:49:59,670 --> 02:50:01,650
stopped doing that because you don't 
like it.

3646
02:50:01,680 --> 02:50:06,680
Don't do this.
Don't hang out with this person hanging 

3647
02:50:06,680 --> 02:50:07,230
out with that person more concentrated,
more on this aspect of your life.

3648
02:50:07,590 --> 02:50:10,680
Just creatively.
It's an unbelievable tool.

3649
02:50:11,070 --> 02:50:16,070
Uh,
I go over a Jujitsu techniques in the 

3650
02:50:16,070 --> 02:50:16,070
tank.
I go over transitions,

3651
02:50:16,070 --> 02:50:17,910
I go over,
stand up comedy in there.

3652
02:50:17,911 --> 02:50:18,930
I go over everything in there.

3653
02:50:19,240 --> 02:50:20,140
Yeah,
that's great.

3654
02:50:20,170 --> 02:50:21,130
I want to check it out.
I mean,

3655
02:50:21,131 --> 02:50:26,131
it sounds the way that you described 
that is very similar to the experiences 

3656
02:50:26,131 --> 02:50:29,230
that I have when I'm in long distance 
running and training.

3657
02:50:29,240 --> 02:50:30,130
Sure.
It's,

3658
02:50:30,160 --> 02:50:31,110
that,
you know,

3659
02:50:31,120 --> 02:50:32,860
it's different because your heart's 
beating and it's,

3660
02:50:32,920 --> 02:50:35,590
it's kind of an active meditation 
version of that,

3661
02:50:35,620 --> 02:50:36,610
but,
you know,

3662
02:50:36,640 --> 02:50:38,080
it's so powerful,
you know,

3663
02:50:38,081 --> 02:50:41,340
and the more that I learn about this 
world of mindfulness you,

3664
02:50:41,380 --> 02:50:46,380
it's just,
it's untapped reservoirs of potential 

3665
02:50:46,380 --> 02:50:47,050
personal potential.
Exactly.

3666
02:50:47,620 --> 02:50:50,620
And um,
you know,

3667
02:50:50,621 --> 02:50:51,910
again,
it goes back to,

3668
02:50:51,940 --> 02:50:56,940
you know,
western culture priorities like this is 

3669
02:50:56,940 --> 02:50:56,940
not,
you know,

3670
02:50:56,940 --> 02:50:56,940
this is,
you know,

3671
02:50:56,940 --> 02:50:59,680
the float lab like your tank.
That's not a mainstream idea.

3672
02:50:59,950 --> 02:51:01,870
You know what I mean?
It's becoming more so.

3673
02:51:01,960 --> 02:51:04,480
But yeah,
but I mean to look the typical American,

3674
02:51:04,620 --> 02:51:05,440
right.
You know what I mean?

3675
02:51:05,470 --> 02:51:09,510
It's kind of a foreign idea,
but this idea that you know,

3676
02:51:09,550 --> 02:51:11,120
your thinking mind is,
is,

3677
02:51:11,180 --> 02:51:15,220
is distinct from your higher 
consciousness and to the extent that you

3678
02:51:15,490 --> 02:51:20,490
have control and you can harness your 
thinking mind for your benefit and 

3679
02:51:20,490 --> 02:51:20,490
you're able to,
you know,

3680
02:51:20,490 --> 02:51:22,660
silence the idol,
negative chatter,

3681
02:51:22,661 --> 02:51:24,070
you know,
most people like you said,

3682
02:51:24,071 --> 02:51:24,940
you know,
it's coffee,

3683
02:51:25,480 --> 02:51:26,410
donuts,
whatever.

3684
02:51:26,750 --> 02:51:28,030
Um,
there is a looping,

3685
02:51:28,300 --> 02:51:33,300
you know,
in my mind loops as much as the next 

3686
02:51:33,300 --> 02:51:36,091
person and generally it's not very kind.
Things that are looping self defeatist 

3687
02:51:36,221 --> 02:51:38,200
ideas,
negative thoughts.

3688
02:51:38,470 --> 02:51:40,840
Oh my God,
I'm going to do Joe Rogan's podcast.

3689
02:51:40,841 --> 02:51:43,180
What if the desk squad army gangs up on 
me?

3690
02:51:43,390 --> 02:51:44,380
You know,
what's going to happen?

3691
02:51:44,381 --> 02:51:45,670
You know,
like whatever it is.

3692
02:51:45,671 --> 02:51:50,671
You know what I mean?
Like at meditation allows you to 

3693
02:51:50,680 --> 02:51:53,350
understand that you don't have to engage
in that.

3694
02:51:53,700 --> 02:51:57,280
It gives you a toolbox to say,
let me tell a different story.

3695
02:51:57,580 --> 02:52:02,580
I don't have to entertain that story,
that story that I've been listening to 

3696
02:52:02,580 --> 02:52:05,701
my entire life that's led me down a 
certain path in my life and helped sort 

3697
02:52:05,701 --> 02:52:06,040
of forge a certain

3698
02:52:06,040 --> 02:52:08,350
trajectory.
What if I tell a new story

3699
02:52:10,340 --> 02:52:13,400
and let's put that story together and 
see where that leads like,

3700
02:52:13,401 --> 02:52:15,290
could there be anything more powerful 
than that?

3701
02:52:16,070 --> 02:52:17,070
Very few things.
No.

3702
02:52:17,570 --> 02:52:20,260
Acting on those positive thoughts.
Write that.

3703
02:52:20,300 --> 02:52:22,550
That's just as powerful if not more.
That's it.

3704
02:52:22,880 --> 02:52:25,520
Yeah.
And and uninstalling those buttons,

3705
02:52:25,521 --> 02:52:30,170
that car that causes you to react and 
create negative consequences for you.

3706
02:52:31,310 --> 02:52:33,410
That's a good way to end this podcast.
The rich roll.

3707
02:52:33,670 --> 02:52:35,210
That was three hours of awesome.

3708
02:52:35,330 --> 02:52:37,200
Yeah.
Thanks.

3709
02:52:37,220 --> 02:52:38,060
Damn,
it's done.

3710
02:52:38,180 --> 02:52:41,060
