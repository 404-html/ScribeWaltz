1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:01,640
The Joe Rogan experience,

2
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:03,560
the war on drugs is destroyed.

3
00:00:03,561 --> 00:00:04,341
Our inner cities,

4
00:00:04,341 --> 00:00:06,110
it's corrupted the police forces.

5
00:00:06,111 --> 00:00:06,780
It's screwed up,

6
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:07,160
uh,

7
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:07,520
you know,

8
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:08,281
a police,

9
00:00:08,281 --> 00:00:08,430
uh,

10
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:12,290
south of the border and now you have a
situation to where your inner city kid

11
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:12,951
and you know,

12
00:00:12,951 --> 00:00:16,670
you've got minimum wage laws and you've
got occupational licensing laws that

13
00:00:16,671 --> 00:00:20,420
make it almost impossible for young kid
to get a legitimate job yet you've got

14
00:00:20,421 --> 00:00:21,950
the gang bangers flashing around,

15
00:00:21,951 --> 00:00:22,131
you know,

16
00:00:22,131 --> 00:00:23,000
a lot of cash.

17
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:23,540
Hey,

18
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:24,380
just deal drugs.

19
00:00:24,381 --> 00:00:25,214
You can make a lot of

20
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:29,830
when you think that minimum wage and
the difficulty in getting licensed for

21
00:00:29,831 --> 00:00:32,110
certain positions are
what's keeping people down.

22
00:00:32,230 --> 00:00:32,800
Of course,

23
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:33,521
minimum wages.

24
00:00:33,521 --> 00:00:34,260
Keeping people down.

25
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:34,840
Absolutely.

26
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:35,440
How is that?

27
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:35,970
How's that?

28
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:36,151
Well,

29
00:00:36,151 --> 00:00:36,750
because remember,

30
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:37,583
you know,

31
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:38,581
when you're young,

32
00:00:38,581 --> 00:00:39,510
when you're teenager,

33
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:39,751
right?

34
00:00:39,751 --> 00:00:40,740
You don't have a lot of skills.

35
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:40,921
I mean,

36
00:00:40,921 --> 00:00:41,370
you really,

37
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:43,080
you might've never had been had a job.

38
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:46,980
And what's more important in getting
a job is not necessarily the paycheck.

39
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:47,940
That's kind of secondary.

40
00:00:47,941 --> 00:00:50,070
It's what you learn on the job.

41
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,031
And you know,

42
00:00:51,031 --> 00:00:53,010
when I had my first jobs
and I was working on me,

43
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:53,401
you know,

44
00:00:53,401 --> 00:00:56,850
you're living in talking about outside
of high school or in high school,

45
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:00,300
the all that's important is the money's
the only thing that's important to know

46
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:01,600
when we,

47
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:01,920
when,

48
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:02,641
when you are,

49
00:01:02,641 --> 00:01:02,851
look,

50
00:01:02,851 --> 00:01:03,720
you want the money,

51
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:03,920
right?

52
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,160
Because you want money for,

53
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:07,820
to take a girl out on a date
or maybe you need gas money,

54
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:08,220
right?

55
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:09,270
But you don't need rent money.

56
00:01:09,271 --> 00:01:10,051
You're living at home,

57
00:01:10,051 --> 00:01:10,980
you don't need food.

58
00:01:10,981 --> 00:01:11,260
Your,

59
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:12,870
your overhead is taking care of.

60
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:18,340
The real benefit is acquiring skills on
the job training that will enable you to

61
00:01:19,591 --> 00:01:22,470
earn more money as you get
older and take on more work

62
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:23,950
responsibility in these skills.

63
00:01:23,951 --> 00:01:25,780
When you're working at Burger joint.

64
00:01:25,781 --> 00:01:26,390
What am I.

65
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:27,191
What skills am I getting?

66
00:01:27,191 --> 00:01:28,210
Working at Newport creamer?

67
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:28,350
No,

68
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:28,590
no,

69
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:29,140
there are a lot.

70
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:29,480
Like,

71
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:32,430
I'll give you an example of gas stations
because gas stations are good examples.

72
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:35,700
I worked at a gas station because at one
point in time there were a lot of jobs

73
00:01:35,701 --> 00:01:36,181
for young kids,

74
00:01:36,181 --> 00:01:36,241
uh,

75
00:01:36,241 --> 00:01:37,920
gas stations and,

76
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:38,500
and,

77
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:39,990
and they work mainly for tips.

78
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,250
They would pump gas,

79
00:01:41,251 --> 00:01:42,810
they would check the air in the tires,

80
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:45,300
they'd wash your windows and
they didn't make very much,

81
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:47,730
but between Philips and
these were the pump jockeys,

82
00:01:47,731 --> 00:01:48,660
right between Phillips,

83
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:52,000
maybe they worked with a mechanic and
they helped out to mechanics and you know,

84
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:57,080
a lot of auto mechanics got their
start as a pump jockeys and you know,

85
00:01:57,950 --> 00:01:58,350
and you know,

86
00:01:58,350 --> 00:01:58,831
eventually,

87
00:01:58,831 --> 00:01:59,040
you know,

88
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,770
they were able to become a mechanic and
they can earn more money as some of them

89
00:02:01,771 --> 00:02:04,100
may be eventually opened up their
own gas station and you know,

90
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,670
became entrepreneurs and had a few,

91
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:06,870
but they got started,

92
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:07,400
uh,

93
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:07,770
you know,

94
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:09,210
at an entry level position.

95
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:09,811
Now of course,

96
00:02:09,811 --> 00:02:10,680
the minimum wage law,

97
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:12,270
it's all self serve.

98
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:12,451
I mean,

99
00:02:12,451 --> 00:02:13,380
you go to a gas station,

100
00:02:13,381 --> 00:02:14,191
there's no human beings there.

101
00:02:14,191 --> 00:02:17,100
Maybe there's one guy that's in a
little booth that's kind of overseeing,

102
00:02:17,101 --> 00:02:17,570
but you know,

103
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:19,050
if you want to check
your air in your tire,

104
00:02:19,051 --> 00:02:19,651
you do yourself.

105
00:02:19,651 --> 00:02:20,461
You want to wash your windows,

106
00:02:20,461 --> 00:02:21,300
you wash her own windows.

107
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:23,850
All those jobs had been
eliminated by the minimum wage.

108
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:27,750
But so as the opportunities that came
with them and now if you want to get a

109
00:02:27,751 --> 00:02:28,230
mechanical,

110
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:29,520
you've got to go to vocational school,

111
00:02:29,521 --> 00:02:30,271
you got to pay money,

112
00:02:30,271 --> 00:02:31,230
you got to go into debt,

113
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:31,860
you know,

114
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,300
maybe you can learn to be a mechanic.

115
00:02:33,301 --> 00:02:34,080
But you know,

116
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,710
on the job training was how young
people use to acquire skills.

117
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:40,380
And now we've got all those
guys going to college.

118
00:02:40,381 --> 00:02:41,730
They get a philosophy degree,

119
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:42,060
you know,

120
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,140
they spent six years,

121
00:02:43,141 --> 00:02:43,430
you know,

122
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:43,920
you know,

123
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,330
barfing at frat parties,

124
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,010
but they graduate with a huge debt.

125
00:02:47,011 --> 00:02:47,844
They know nothing,

126
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:48,420
you know,

127
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:50,190
a lot of them would have
been better off getting,

128
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:50,490
you know,

129
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:52,800
getting a low paying job and
learning how to do something.

130
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:53,340
This

131
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,410
time of this,

132
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,990
when people did learn how to be a
mechanic by becoming a pump jockey,

133
00:02:58,050 --> 00:02:59,380
there was a minimum wage in effect.

134
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:00,130
Well,

135
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:03,700
the minimum wage in America
didn't start until 1938.

136
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,640
But I looked at a gas station,

137
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:07,360
but I had a minimum wage.

138
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:12,660
It started in 1938 and it only
affected some certain federal workers.

139
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:13,930
It wasn't.

140
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:15,100
And it was 20,

141
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:15,371
it was,

142
00:03:15,371 --> 00:03:17,290
was it five slash twenty
five cents an hour.

143
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:21,580
It didn't apply to most workers
until the mid 19 sixties.

144
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:25,480
So it was the war on poverty
that really brought about the,

145
00:03:25,481 --> 00:03:25,930
um,

146
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:26,650
the minimum wage.

147
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:27,160
So,

148
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:27,560
and,

149
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,320
and of course over time,

150
00:03:29,321 --> 00:03:33,010
as the minimum wage got higher and
higher during the sixties and seventies,

151
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,440
that's when it really began
to take a bigger toll.

152
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:35,710
But at,

153
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:38,170
like if you look now at like
black teenage unemployment,

154
00:03:38,171 --> 00:03:39,130
which is off the charts,

155
00:03:39,131 --> 00:03:39,941
which is what 50,

156
00:03:39,941 --> 00:03:40,331
60,

157
00:03:40,331 --> 00:03:41,770
70 percent of sure example it is.

158
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,720
But if you go back
before the minimum wage,

159
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:44,740
right?

160
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:47,080
Black teenage unemployment
was made out of 15 percent.

161
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:49,390
It was actually lower than
white teenage unemployment.

162
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:50,320
Um,

163
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:50,700
and,

164
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:51,240
and,

165
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:51,520
and,

166
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,980
and all this stuff you take,

167
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:57,450
you take the bottom rung off the job
ladder and you just obliterate it.

168
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:00,130
Used to make it impossible for young,

169
00:04:00,131 --> 00:04:02,050
unskilled people to get a job.

170
00:04:02,051 --> 00:04:04,660
And it's not just a minimum wage
because that's the beginning,

171
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:05,200
right?

172
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,000
Because if you employ
somebody at the minimum wage,

173
00:04:07,001 --> 00:04:08,740
you still got to pay payroll taxes.

174
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:10,420
You got to pay unemployment taxes.

175
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:12,880
You've got other mandated costs,

176
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:15,640
legal costs that increased
the cost of hiring.

177
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,670
So maybe even though the
minimum wage is seven,

178
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:18,580
25 an hour,

179
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:21,940
maybe it cost you 10 bucks to hire the
guy an hour even though you only give

180
00:04:21,941 --> 00:04:22,301
them seven,

181
00:04:22,301 --> 00:04:23,710
25 is cost you 10 bucks.

182
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:24,970
What if,

183
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:27,220
what if their productivity
is only worth $6?

184
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,001
You can't hire him.

185
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:28,834
It's impossible.

186
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:30,520
You're not going to
hire him to lose money.

187
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:31,750
You're not going to train somebody.

188
00:04:31,751 --> 00:04:32,250
I mean,

189
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:32,530
you know,

190
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:33,400
there are a lot of people,

191
00:04:33,401 --> 00:04:34,300
these success stories,

192
00:04:34,301 --> 00:04:34,451
you know,

193
00:04:34,451 --> 00:04:36,220
people go from the mail
room to the board room,

194
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:36,581
you know,

195
00:04:36,581 --> 00:04:39,670
it's harder to start at the bottom
because it's hard to get your foot on the

196
00:04:39,671 --> 00:04:40,840
bottom right because,

197
00:04:40,841 --> 00:04:41,031
you know,

198
00:04:41,031 --> 00:04:45,640
you have to be at a much higher level
and it disproportionately impacts poor

199
00:04:45,641 --> 00:04:46,330
kids.

200
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:47,560
Inner City kids,

201
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,131
uh,

202
00:04:48,131 --> 00:04:48,710
you know,

203
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:49,010
and,

204
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:53,020
and it favors these minimum wage laws
will favor skilled workers over unskilled

205
00:04:53,021 --> 00:04:53,291
workers.

206
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:54,760
Because if I have to pay a certain wage,

207
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:57,010
well then maybe I'll hire
somebody that has more skill.

208
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:57,641
In fact,

209
00:04:57,641 --> 00:04:58,780
it was the skilled workers,

210
00:04:58,781 --> 00:05:01,300
the labor unions that
lobbied for the minimum wage,

211
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:03,220
not because it benefited
them because they,

212
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:04,750
they made much more than minimum wage.

213
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:08,470
What they wanted to do is make it
expensive to hire unskilled labor.

214
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,120
So you wouldn't hire the unskilled labor.

215
00:05:10,121 --> 00:05:11,890
You would just hire the union labor.

216
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:12,701
I see what you're saying.

217
00:05:12,701 --> 00:05:16,810
So you're saying essentially is that
minimum wage is more government intrusion

218
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:21,520
and the more freedom that you have
the government take away from you,

219
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:23,650
whether it's minimum wage freedom,

220
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:25,660
whether it's tax free and whatever it is.

221
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,150
The worst is gonna be you're
gonna have more regulations,

222
00:05:28,151 --> 00:05:29,310
you're gonna have more people involved,

223
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:29,981
more red tape,

224
00:05:29,981 --> 00:05:30,641
more bullshit,

225
00:05:30,641 --> 00:05:31,910
and more waste more.

226
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,360
I should have a right to work,

227
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:35,110
you know,

228
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:36,260
if you know,

229
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,810
if I want to write it,

230
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:38,260
you know,

231
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:39,670
if you know the interesting thing,

232
00:05:39,671 --> 00:05:41,350
look at all these lawsuits now.

233
00:05:41,351 --> 00:05:43,540
The internships in the
entertainment industry,

234
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:43,811
you know,

235
00:05:43,811 --> 00:05:45,190
this has the perverse effect of it.

236
00:05:45,191 --> 00:05:49,180
So the government made it illegal to
pay somebody below the minimum wage,

237
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:50,980
but it was okay if they worked for free.

238
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:51,580
Right?

239
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:54,670
So now you have all these interns who
probably would have been paid something if

240
00:05:54,671 --> 00:05:55,720
it wasn't for the minimum wage,

241
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:57,710
but since it was illegal
to pay them something,

242
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:59,120
they ended up working for nothing.

243
00:05:59,480 --> 00:05:59,871
Of course,

244
00:05:59,871 --> 00:06:01,910
now they're suing and
they're winning lawsuits say,

245
00:06:01,911 --> 00:06:02,290
hey,

246
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:03,260
you have to pay me.

247
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:06,290
So now they're going to
destroy the internships and
now a lot of these companies

248
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:08,900
that used to have internships aren't
going to have them anymore about the

249
00:06:08,901 --> 00:06:10,120
interns get college credit.

250
00:06:10,121 --> 00:06:11,510
It wasn't that the whole idea behind it.

251
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:12,533
Some of them do,

252
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:12,981
but then.

253
00:06:12,981 --> 00:06:16,040
But then that was even worse because
what would happen sometimes in order to

254
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:18,580
keep themselves safe because the
employers didn't want to know,

255
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:20,120
run a foul of the employment law.

256
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:23,450
So they would only give you the internship
if you got it through a college.

257
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:23,810
Right.

258
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:26,840
So now what would happen is you'd actually
have to pay to be an intern because

259
00:06:26,841 --> 00:06:30,500
you'd go and pay tuition to a college
just so you can go and work for free.

260
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:31,071
I mean,

261
00:06:31,071 --> 00:06:34,310
wouldn't it be better not to pay the
tuition and go into debt and just work for

262
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:36,500
a low wage than to pay to work for no age?

263
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:36,831
I mean,

264
00:06:36,831 --> 00:06:40,220
this is what happens when you have
all these government regulations.

265
00:06:40,221 --> 00:06:43,070
Everybody is worse off and you know,

266
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:43,551
people,

267
00:06:43,551 --> 00:06:44,181
people think,

268
00:06:44,181 --> 00:06:44,301
oh,

269
00:06:44,301 --> 00:06:46,670
these young people are being exploited.

270
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:46,850
No,

271
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:47,683
they're not.

272
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:48,930
It's not exploitation in.

273
00:06:48,931 --> 00:06:52,850
A lot of times it's the best thing that
can happen to them is they get a job and

274
00:06:52,851 --> 00:06:53,180
you know,

275
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:53,661
people say,

276
00:06:53,661 --> 00:06:53,841
well,

277
00:06:53,841 --> 00:06:54,021
you know,

278
00:06:54,021 --> 00:06:56,000
you can't raise a family
on the minimum wage.

279
00:06:56,001 --> 00:06:56,691
Of course not,

280
00:06:56,691 --> 00:06:57,860
and you shouldn't even try.

281
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:58,460
I mean,

282
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,680
if all you can do is flip burgers,

283
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,180
why are you starting a family?

284
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:03,110
I mean you should,

285
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:03,720
you know,

286
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:03,910
you,

287
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:04,080
you,

288
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,960
you got to develop your skills.

289
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:09,890
You got to be able to earn more money
than that before you take on those extra

290
00:07:09,891 --> 00:07:10,730
responsibilities.

291
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:11,661
But if you say,

292
00:07:11,661 --> 00:07:11,930
hey,

293
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:15,410
every wage has to be a wage
that could let you know,

294
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:16,310
support a family,

295
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:18,110
then there are no entry level jobs.

296
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:21,320
Well then how do you enter the labor
market if there's no entry level position,

297
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:21,950
you know,

298
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:22,131
well,

299
00:07:22,131 --> 00:07:24,140
if you're in a situation
like a fast food Gig,

300
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:24,890
what,

301
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:26,540
where does that lead to the manager?

302
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:26,811
I mean,

303
00:07:26,811 --> 00:07:26,941
what,

304
00:07:26,941 --> 00:07:27,130
what,

305
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:29,520
what are you going to rise
through the ranks at a fast food?

306
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,790
Some people write,

307
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,000
some people start out,

308
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:32,780
you know,

309
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:32,991
uh,

310
00:07:32,991 --> 00:07:33,230
you know,

311
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:35,030
cooking French fries or mopping up and,

312
00:07:35,031 --> 00:07:37,550
and go onto b if own a franchise.

313
00:07:37,551 --> 00:07:37,731
I mean,

314
00:07:37,731 --> 00:07:40,130
so you can certainly move
up and there are people,

315
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:40,570
uh,

316
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:43,550
I think the guy who's about
to be the new CEO of Walmart,

317
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:47,450
his first job was working on a loading
dock and what are the distribution

318
00:07:47,451 --> 00:07:47,811
centers?

319
00:07:47,811 --> 00:07:48,520
And now he's the abuse.

320
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,220
The CEO,

321
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:50,840
he worked his way up to
the very top of the call.

322
00:07:50,841 --> 00:07:51,674
He went to college.

323
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:52,250
Uh,

324
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:52,610
but I mean,

325
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:53,000
that's not,

326
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,461
but that's not what,

327
00:07:53,461 --> 00:07:54,730
how he got his foot in
the door and I don't,

328
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:55,141
I probably,

329
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:55,370
you know,

330
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:55,880
but,

331
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:56,440
but the,

332
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:56,711
I mean,

333
00:07:56,711 --> 00:07:58,850
they wouldn't have hired him to
run the company and let's say,

334
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:00,560
but I don't know,

335
00:08:00,561 --> 00:08:01,130
but maybe,

336
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:01,490
maybe,

337
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:02,820
maybe the fact that he worked there,

338
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:03,790
gave maybe that game,

339
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,110
a legacy assure that
definitely had an impact.

340
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:08,540
But if you take a look at
something that works at Mcdonald's,

341
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:12,230
you don't necessarily have to
work up the chain of Mcdonald's.

342
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:14,090
Mcdonald's could be your first job.

343
00:08:14,091 --> 00:08:14,330
Look,

344
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:15,470
what were my first jobs?

345
00:08:15,471 --> 00:08:16,610
I delivered groceries.

346
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:18,320
I bagged groceries.

347
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:18,950
I,

348
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:19,311
I,

349
00:08:19,311 --> 00:08:19,880
um,

350
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:22,700
I sold a clothing retail in the mall.

351
00:08:22,701 --> 00:08:23,534
I sold shoes.

352
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:25,190
I sold cable door to door.

353
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:25,691
They said,

354
00:08:25,691 --> 00:08:25,880
well,

355
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,061
you know,

356
00:08:26,061 --> 00:08:27,030
did I move up in the.

357
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:27,360
And.

358
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:27,651
No,

359
00:08:27,651 --> 00:08:28,130
but I,

360
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:30,370
I ended up getting other jobs where,

361
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:30,740
you know,

362
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:32,360
the sales skills were important.

363
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:32,811
Uh,

364
00:08:32,811 --> 00:08:33,644
you know,

365
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:34,640
even when I was,

366
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:38,120
got my first job at a supermarket and a
lot of times I was just mopping up the

367
00:08:38,121 --> 00:08:38,810
floors.

368
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:41,150
I was bagging the groceries that
I would deliver the groceries.

369
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:43,130
But you just learn to show up at time,

370
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:43,790
you know,

371
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:45,320
and now you have something
that you've done.

372
00:08:45,321 --> 00:08:46,160
I mean a lot of it.

373
00:08:46,161 --> 00:08:48,770
So you get a job at Mcdonald's and
then you get a job someplace else.

374
00:08:48,771 --> 00:08:49,780
That's better because what,

375
00:08:49,781 --> 00:08:50,930
what did you do before you were here?

376
00:08:50,931 --> 00:08:51,890
While I worked at Mcdonald's.

377
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:52,820
How long were you there?

378
00:08:52,821 --> 00:08:53,780
I was there for a couple of years.

379
00:08:53,781 --> 00:08:54,021
In fact,

380
00:08:54,021 --> 00:08:54,890
I still have the job.

381
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:56,880
Oh well that means at
least you didn't get fired.

382
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:57,630
You have the job.

383
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:58,920
I mean you've got something.

384
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,510
You've got to start somewhere.

385
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:04,770
Everybody starts somewhere and you can't
expect to get paid a lot of money when

386
00:09:04,771 --> 00:09:06,210
you first start out.

387
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:10,820
You've got to make yourself more valuable
because what you are when individuals,

388
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,960
we sell our labor to the highest bidder,

389
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:13,680
you know?

390
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:17,610
And so what you have to do is you've
got to figure out how can I increase my

391
00:09:17,611 --> 00:09:21,750
value to a potential employer so that
he'll pay me more money but isn't the idea

392
00:09:21,751 --> 00:09:23,850
of minimum wage just to
keep it from being gross,

393
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:25,140
not just make it.

394
00:09:25,141 --> 00:09:27,300
So it is $15 an hour is pretty low.

395
00:09:27,301 --> 00:09:29,490
It's incredibly difficult
to make a living.

396
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:29,650
No,

397
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:29,751
no,

398
00:09:29,751 --> 00:09:29,970
no.

399
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:31,440
It's getting $15 an hour.

400
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:34,690
But I'm going say you don't have to
make a living and feed yourself if,

401
00:09:34,691 --> 00:09:35,010
if,

402
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:35,610
if they,

403
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:39,810
if they enforced a minimum wage
of $15 an hour on like Mcdonald's,

404
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:41,370
there would be no human
beings working there.

405
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:42,270
It would all be automated.

406
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:43,223
They wouldn't,

407
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:43,620
you know,

408
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:46,380
there might be one guy there that
made sure that the robots didn't,

409
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:46,700
uh,

410
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:46,920
you know,

411
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:47,753
didn't break down.

412
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:48,481
But you know,

413
00:09:48,481 --> 00:09:50,120
there'd be machines making the hamburgers,

414
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:51,960
make it a French fries
would be like a gas station.

415
00:09:51,961 --> 00:09:52,621
Wouldn't that be good?

416
00:09:52,621 --> 00:09:55,290
Just like we were talking
about deregulation and the
government forcing them to

417
00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:58,410
get real jobs for the people
that work in the fast food,

418
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:01,460
Burger King and forced them out there.

419
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:01,690
No,

420
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:02,191
but then they would,

421
00:10:02,191 --> 00:10:05,680
what would they do that and just go on
welfare for them to figure out a way to

422
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,720
get a real job.

423
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:07,051
But no,

424
00:10:07,051 --> 00:10:09,190
but that is their entry to the job market.

425
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:09,541
I mean,

426
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:10,440
they have no skills.

427
00:10:10,441 --> 00:10:10,710
Look,

428
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:11,101
believe me,

429
00:10:11,101 --> 00:10:12,480
if these people had better skills,

430
00:10:12,481 --> 00:10:13,680
would they be working at Mcdonald's?

431
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:13,981
Now,

432
00:10:13,981 --> 00:10:14,910
part of the problem is,

433
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:15,470
and this isn't,

434
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:19,650
you know that there are some people that
really could be working better jobs,

435
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:23,610
but they're not because we have this
phony economy that is preventing those

436
00:10:23,611 --> 00:10:24,870
better jobs from being created.

437
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:25,450
That's the.

438
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:26,191
That's the problem.

439
00:10:26,191 --> 00:10:29,670
There are a lot of people now that are
working at Mcdonald's because that's all

440
00:10:29,671 --> 00:10:31,050
they can get and you know,

441
00:10:31,051 --> 00:10:31,884
it's not like you know,

442
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,900
at least they got that to fall back on,

443
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,570
but the problem is why
aren't there better jobs?

444
00:10:36,571 --> 00:10:39,840
Why aren't the jobs that would normally
be there for you to work up right?

445
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:41,610
To the jobs that are
higher up on the ladder.

446
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:42,630
Where are those jobs?

447
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:46,110
Those jobs are being destroyed by the
government because we need more savings.

448
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,550
We need more capital investment.

449
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:51,480
We need higher interest rates for that
to happen and the government is so busy

450
00:10:51,481 --> 00:10:55,050
inflating this bubble economy that they're
sucking all the air out of the real

451
00:10:55,051 --> 00:10:55,441
economy.

452
00:10:55,441 --> 00:10:59,250
They're diverting resources from main
street to Wall Street and they are

453
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,260
preventing these jobs from being created,

454
00:11:01,261 --> 00:11:01,611
in fact,

455
00:11:01,611 --> 00:11:03,480
are destroying a lot
of the jobs that exist.

456
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,460
So how would you fix that if you.

457
00:11:05,461 --> 00:11:07,710
If I'm Obama and I say Peter Schiff,

458
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,470
I heard you on the Joe Rogan experience.

459
00:11:09,471 --> 00:11:11,610
You make a lot of sense soon guys.

460
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,473
I got working me.

461
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,380
Fucking suck.

462
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:14,390
Come over here man.

463
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:14,851
Sit down.

464
00:11:14,851 --> 00:11:15,870
Tell me what the fuck to do.

465
00:11:15,871 --> 00:11:16,651
What can I do here?

466
00:11:16,651 --> 00:11:18,690
How do we fix this mess
other than resigning,

467
00:11:18,691 --> 00:11:19,524
but I guess if he's,

468
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:22,590
if he's actually going to
listen to it and make friends,

469
00:11:22,591 --> 00:11:25,780
but if he's actually going to listen to
me that I don't want him to resign with.

470
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:27,870
He actually has that kind of epiphany.

471
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:30,930
Let's pretend well attend Jamie's the
president and you've got to convince him.

472
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:31,771
Yeah,

473
00:11:31,771 --> 00:11:32,530
well then you,

474
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:33,570
she got a.

475
00:11:33,571 --> 00:11:34,740
What would you tell them to do?

476
00:11:34,741 --> 00:11:35,610
What would you tell him to do?

477
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:39,360
He's got to start repealing
rules and regulations and,

478
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:39,760
and,

479
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:39,970
and,

480
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:44,790
and shrinking government and closing
down agencies and departments and laying

481
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,750
off government workers,

482
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,393
government workers.

483
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:48,770
How do you.

484
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:49,603
Where do you start?

485
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:50,820
I'll start at the top.

486
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:51,121
I mean,

487
00:11:51,121 --> 00:11:53,160
we've got to fire the president.

488
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:54,940
Do you want to save the company?

489
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:56,210
You got to go under yourself.

490
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:58,260
Get rid of all of the economic advisors.

491
00:11:58,261 --> 00:12:00,000
Look at the Department of Energy,

492
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:01,110
Department of Agriculture,

493
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:02,470
Department of Education schools.

494
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:03,413
Every one of them.

495
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:04,781
Some of them are,

496
00:12:04,781 --> 00:12:05,291
some of them aren't,

497
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:07,240
but we can't afford them
and they're not helping.

498
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:08,680
They're not making the country richer.

499
00:12:08,681 --> 00:12:09,640
They're making it poor.
