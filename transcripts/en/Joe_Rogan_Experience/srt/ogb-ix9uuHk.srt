1
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:06,640
Four, three, two, one, boom. And we're
live. What's up brother? How are you?

2
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:09,850
Very, very good. Thanks for doing this
man. I'm very excited to have you in here.

3
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:13,040
I'm honored to be here man.
I was just thinking about
this. It actually, I was like

4
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:18,530
the fucking people that have
been on the show, man. Yeah,

5
00:00:18,531 --> 00:00:22,700
I think about it sometimes too.
Freaks me out. Uh, Sam Harris,

6
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:28,190
James Hetfield. Uh, man. Yeah. I
was thinking about all the people,

7
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,860
man. I was like, how do I compete with
these guys? Just be Matt Brown. I know.

8
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:33,530
Talking about man.
I mean I could beat all their asses.

9
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:37,780
Well, in certain situations,
that's all the counts,

10
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:42,580
the situations that I
thrive in. Exactly. So, uh,

11
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:46,330
you are retired and now you're not now
he just signed a fight. Carlos condit.

12
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:50,980
You got it. Damn. That's a good
fight. Oh, like that. Yeah.

13
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:54,100
I think Carlos needed to fight
back to that fight with Neil Magni.

14
00:00:54,101 --> 00:00:56,680
He looked like he was suffering
through some ring rust.

15
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,910
Yeah,
man timing.

16
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:01,490
I've talked to a lot of people about
that cause that's the first thing that

17
00:01:01,491 --> 00:01:04,250
always comes up, right. It is how he
came back and looked in that fight.

18
00:01:04,251 --> 00:01:06,980
And I've shared with Neil
a lot, man. I'll tell you,

19
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:11,260
Neil can shut a fucking game down
right away. Yeah. Very good. Yeah.

20
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:13,360
We can't take away from the Hitman.
Um,

21
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:18,950
Carlos didn't seem to show any sense
of urgency either though. So, you know,

22
00:01:18,951 --> 00:01:20,360
I think it's both sides,

23
00:01:20,361 --> 00:01:25,170
but I think he's also going to be
looking for redemption with me. Yeah,

24
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:28,400
I think so too. Yeah. He wanted
to come back right away actually.

25
00:01:28,401 --> 00:01:32,720
They actually asked me to fight. It was,
would have been like six weeks notice.

26
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:34,460
What's the longest you've ever taken off?

27
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:36,080
Okay.

28
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:36,881
Uh,
after I fought,

29
00:01:36,881 --> 00:01:40,570
cowboy got knocked the fuck out and
took a year off from five days ago.

30
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:43,510
So what does it like
coming back after a year?

31
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:46,170
Okay.

32
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:49,170
It felt natural to me
personally to you. Yeah. Yeah.

33
00:01:49,171 --> 00:01:51,900
I didn't feel anything
different people, right. Yeah.

34
00:01:51,901 --> 00:01:54,630
Someone was talking to me about this
Sarah Day ring rust and I was like,

35
00:01:54,631 --> 00:01:57,090
you know,
everybody's different man.

36
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:00,210
Every single person is going
to react a little differently.

37
00:02:00,211 --> 00:02:03,630
And I think also when you have someone,
you know,

38
00:02:03,631 --> 00:02:05,940
John Danaher was talking about like
the different types of fighters, right?

39
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:09,960
I think he just group three
different types of fighters.
Uh, like a violence guy,

40
00:02:09,961 --> 00:02:13,830
a tactical guy, and something
else. Well, I think it's gonna.

41
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,720
I think there's more types of fighters
and what he went through, but there's, um,

42
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:21,630
I think it's going to affect every single
type of person differently, you know,

43
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:23,490
and I felt like I fought,
for instance,

44
00:02:23,491 --> 00:02:27,480
like I fought them much more tactical
fight against Diego. It wasn't, I mean,

45
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:27,870
you could,

46
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:31,350
you could easily go and with Diego and
just go to fucking war with him. Right?

47
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:35,510
I mean, he's Melendez style. Exactly.
He's totally down for that. Diego was,

48
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:38,880
you know, he will wake right up and
go for that. Right. I was like, man,

49
00:02:38,881 --> 00:02:41,220
I'm better than him. Let's
just be tactical. And a,

50
00:02:41,221 --> 00:02:44,070
I think that was part of why it
helped now that now I think, uh,

51
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:47,530
someone that goes in with
a more violence style, uh,

52
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,200
which I've done many times in
my life. Um, I think that's a,

53
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:56,300
a bit more complicated because there's
a lot more timing in reaction in that

54
00:02:57,241 --> 00:03:00,790
whereas the strategy,
you have very clear path to victory,

55
00:03:00,791 --> 00:03:04,670
you know exactly what you got to do is
just you just going in there and just, um,

56
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,610
you know,
connecting the dots when you get in there

57
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:09,290
and staying on the plan.
Exactly. Yeah. Yeah.

58
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:11,420
Now when you get a guy like Diego though,

59
00:03:11,421 --> 00:03:14,600
that temptation has gotta be always
there, right? Because he's so willing.

60
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:17,600
Well, if a, if it is necessary

61
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:19,180
because you love that kind of fighting,

62
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:21,550
that's one of the reasons
why you're so loved.

63
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:25,810
Like there's never been a matte
brown fight ever. That's boring.

64
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:29,440
There's a lot of guys that
have because of styles,

65
00:03:29,441 --> 00:03:34,000
because of whatever they've had fights
that weren't very crowd pleasing,

66
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:38,740
but your style has always been do or die,
seek and destroy.

67
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,380
That's one of the reasons
why people love you.

68
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,290
Yeah. Well, I mean,

69
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:45,390
that just goes back to my mentality of
why I'm fighting to start with, right?

70
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:48,840
It's not really about just winning.

71
00:03:48,841 --> 00:03:52,860
I think that's sort of a western culture
thing. Sort of an American thing. Like I,

72
00:03:52,861 --> 00:03:57,810
I kind of go back to the original pride
and it's like, look, just fight man.

73
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:00,450
You know,
this is a fun thing.

74
00:04:00,451 --> 00:04:04,620
This is a bad ass thing we're doing is
an amazing thing. Go in there and fight,

75
00:04:04,621 --> 00:04:08,790
test yourself, the Bushido
spirit, things like that. And not,

76
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:13,740
it doesn't have to be just win at
all costs, you know, this is, uh,

77
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:18,120
you know, to me it waters
down the sport. I mean,

78
00:04:18,121 --> 00:04:22,950
that's not what combat is about.
Some, you know, it's not me.

79
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:26,860
Well, I mean, that's what
makes it interesting is that
there are different styles.

80
00:04:26,861 --> 00:04:29,770
There's people that have safety first
styles where they're just fighting new

81
00:04:29,771 --> 00:04:30,400
wind.

82
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:35,080
And then there's other people
like yourself that just
whatever's inside you that

83
00:04:35,081 --> 00:04:37,780
comes out, you know, I always said
this, there's certain dudes like, uh,

84
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:40,390
because of your history, because of, uh,

85
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,200
I mean you had an overdose
where you literally died.

86
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:49,080
And there's the same with court McGee. Uh,
he had the same situation happened. Him,

87
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,080
I always said,
talked to him.

88
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:55,180
Dudes that have gone to the other side
are fucking terrifying inside of the

89
00:04:55,181 --> 00:04:58,180
cage. There's like, there's,
there's a certain thing,

90
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:02,050
I don't know if it's just coincidentally
that both of you guys have that mindset

91
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:05,980
or let's forget about even core, but you
have this mindset. And I've always said,

92
00:05:05,981 --> 00:05:10,981
I wonder if there's a correlation between
such extreme lows in your life where

93
00:05:13,631 --> 00:05:15,610
you bought them down so hard.
Literally,

94
00:05:15,611 --> 00:05:17,500
your body had shut down
and you were ready to,

95
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:20,320
you ready to pass on the doctor saved you,

96
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:25,450
and you've got a mindset going
into that cage. That's just,

97
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:29,530
it's just another notch more
intense than most people,

98
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,290
certainly. And that that's,
uh, you know, to be honest,

99
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:35,260
that's something I've sort of struggled
with a lot too because it wasn't

100
00:05:35,261 --> 00:05:37,360
actually that specific moment.

101
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,370
The overdose that kind of
affected me the way it did.

102
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:45,160
It was more a long term life of a,

103
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,300
well I would say I've just
been an angry person, honestly,

104
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:54,240
like just since I grew up. So it was
all about channeling that anger. Um,

105
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:57,260
a lot of fighters like
that. Right? I think so.

106
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:00,710
I think it was one of the beauties of
martial arts that helps you channel that.

107
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:04,500
Yeah. I mean we all have
to find an outlet. Um, I,

108
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:07,570
I didn't discover martial arts,
uh,

109
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:13,130
until what, 2123 to 21,
22, something like that.

110
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:19,220
And, uh, you know, I said before, my
outlet was drugs and alcohol, you know,

111
00:06:19,221 --> 00:06:23,660
that was my, my way to say
fuck everybody. Right. And, uh,

112
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:28,100
you know, just went too far.
But, uh, like I said, you know,

113
00:06:28,101 --> 00:06:30,050
when a is expressed in the cage,

114
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:35,530
that's more of a longterm thing
growing up an angry person.

115
00:06:36,411 --> 00:06:40,970
And then, um, you know, I always give a
lot of credit to Jamie Josta hate breed,

116
00:06:40,971 --> 00:06:43,250
you know, uh, that's where
I'll walk out to nowadays.

117
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:48,320
It's a dream come true to have a
walkout song by them. And, uh, um,

118
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,740
that was like the first time that I was
able to find a positive outlet for that

119
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:59,150
energy. You know, I didn't know
what heavy metal was and growing up,

120
00:06:59,151 --> 00:07:02,750
you know what I mean? I, I grew
up in a small farm town and uh,

121
00:07:02,751 --> 00:07:06,230
I didn't know what that was,
but heavy metal gave me an outlet.

122
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:10,670
And hate breed was the first one that
gave me a positive outlet before it was a,

123
00:07:10,671 --> 00:07:15,170
it was negative. Pantera,
slayer, like stuff like this,

124
00:07:15,171 --> 00:07:18,620
it's all negativity, you
know. So this rage is,

125
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:23,330
is coming out in a negative sense and
get to express through drugs, alcohol,

126
00:07:23,331 --> 00:07:25,010
hanging with the wrong
people and things like that.

127
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:28,370
And then there's a turning
point where I'm like, man,

128
00:07:28,371 --> 00:07:33,371
this can be a positive thing and I
can use this energy directed towards

129
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:38,210
something positive. What were you angry
about growing up? A good question.

130
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:43,700
Um, man, that goes deep,
man, because, uh, you know,

131
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,890
I grew up in a very, very, very
small town, 200 people population.

132
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:53,090
I didn't see a skyscraper.
And until I was,

133
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:56,150
I mean like up in person, like
we drove by it in Dayton, Ohio,

134
00:07:56,151 --> 00:08:01,100
which is in a big town in itself, um,
until I was like over 18 years old,

135
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:05,270
you know, so I was, I always felt like
there was so much more out there for me.

136
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:09,590
And I was kind of, expat grew up in a
machine shop. My Dad was a machinist,

137
00:08:09,591 --> 00:08:14,420
so I was doing that from like five years
old. I was sweeping the fucking floor.

138
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:19,850
And I was like, I was like, man, this
is not what I'm meant to be. Like,

139
00:08:19,851 --> 00:08:22,970
I'm supposed to be something great.
But, uh, but everybody around me is,

140
00:08:22,971 --> 00:08:26,120
I know this is what you do.
You live in this little town and you do,

141
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:31,240
you follow the rules, you're going to
be a machinist or a farmer or you know,

142
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:35,660
whatever. And uh, you know, that
Shit pissed me off, you know?

143
00:08:35,661 --> 00:08:38,120
And I never really found my niche.

144
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:43,280
And so I was homeschooled actually
for I think two years in junior high.

145
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:47,900
So I think that was sort of actually the
start because I went back to school and

146
00:08:47,901 --> 00:08:52,280
when I went back to school, I was now
the outsider. I didn't have any friends.

147
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:54,730
Um, and then going up, uh,

148
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:59,480
all of a sudden I'm in high school and
I have no friends. I have no, uh, I,

149
00:08:59,481 --> 00:09:01,690
I can't get laid for shit.
Um,

150
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:05,040
I think that's what causes you care and
a lot of people in the world, right?

151
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:08,610
Oh yeah. And depression.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

152
00:09:08,611 --> 00:09:10,290
And at the exact same time,

153
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:14,250
I'm starting to experiment
with drugs and alcohol.

154
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:18,990
So you put the two together, you
know, um, I was supposed to be, um,

155
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:23,670
the prodigal son, you know what I mean?
Like I was very intelligent. I was,

156
00:09:23,671 --> 00:09:25,440
um,
you know,

157
00:09:25,441 --> 00:09:28,380
I like I was doing things by the time
I was 15 years old in the machine shop,

158
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:33,660
that guys,
they've been working for my father for 10,

159
00:09:33,661 --> 00:09:36,930
15 years, couldn't do. You know
what I mean? So I was sort of,

160
00:09:36,931 --> 00:09:39,090
this product was saying I was
good at athletics and everything,

161
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:44,550
had no problem with all that stuff. So I
think, uh, it was just sort of a backlash,

162
00:09:44,551 --> 00:09:47,640
you know? And then I let that
anger get the best of me.

163
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:53,820
So now when you were doing drugs and
alcohol, what were the drugs like?

164
00:09:53,821 --> 00:09:55,680
What was the drug that
caused you to overdose?

165
00:09:55,850 --> 00:09:59,510
Heroin and injection.
Yeah. Damn, that's deep.

166
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:04,520
When you're injecting it, that's, that's
when you're all in baby. And you know,

167
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:06,920
I didn't actually do it a whole lot.
It's kind of the funny thing.

168
00:10:06,921 --> 00:10:09,650
A lot of people thought that I was
addicted to heroin and I wasn't.

169
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:12,200
I think that was probably
the fifth time that I did it.

170
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,610
Maybe six something like I
didn't count, but, um, you know,

171
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:20,810
that was sorta my fuck.
That was my step into the dark side,

172
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:25,700
you know, and it, and a blessing
and a curse man, you know,

173
00:10:25,701 --> 00:10:29,240
it immediately he was like, oh,
okay. That's what can happen. Right.

174
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:34,220
It's the step back. Uh, and you
know, I was very naive, very,

175
00:10:34,221 --> 00:10:38,690
uh, man, I was a fool really,
like, because what I did,

176
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:43,880
I remember leaving the, uh, uh,
the hospital and I was like, okay,

177
00:10:43,881 --> 00:10:46,430
well I'm never doing heroin again,
but let's go do some coke.

178
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:53,820
Right? So I was just a dummy man. Um,

179
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:59,090
I think I was 21, 22, one of those,
I mean it was like 15 years ago.

180
00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:03,380
There's a lot of stuff. I,
I, I was actually kind of
thinking about like, so again,

181
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,950
you know, on this podcast, I was
like, uh, cause that, you know,

182
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:11,000
there's probably going to come up on
it. It's a pretty intense story. Um,

183
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:14,000
I was like, damn, I can't remember
all the details of that shit.

184
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:18,590
It was like a long time ago. But
anyway, yeah. So I was like 21,

185
00:11:18,591 --> 00:11:23,270
22 and um,
it wasn't too much long later,

186
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:27,380
you know, I'll live with this girl. And
you know, she was a drug addict too,

187
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,280
and she had a couple of kids and it
was like, it was like, all right,

188
00:11:31,281 --> 00:11:35,240
well now I've got a place to
live. Like, let's get fucked up,

189
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,900
you know? And it was a, I never did

190
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:45,080
heroin again after that, obviously.
Um, I think I did oxies though.

191
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:49,340
Percosets stuff like that. He's basically
the same thing. Right? Yeah. Which, which,

192
00:11:49,341 --> 00:11:51,290
I mean,
I didn't realize it at the time,

193
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:56,020
but really my drug of choice
was meth back in that day.

194
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:58,390
That was what I really liked.

195
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,910
And that was actually what I
was addicted to at one point.

196
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:06,480
And I ended up going to jail and that
was what got me out of addiction.

197
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,570
I didn't realize I was
addicted until I was in jail.

198
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:15,460
So what made you realize that when
you were in jail or just, you know,

199
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:19,180
just couldn't stop thinking about
it and just won it and just, I mean,

200
00:12:19,181 --> 00:12:23,680
I didn't get to have like, like,
um, like cold sweats or anything.

201
00:12:23,681 --> 00:12:28,410
I don't think that happens with uppers,
but, um, I mean, I was just, you know,

202
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:31,240
like the couldn't stop thinking
about it, man. I was like, dude,

203
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:35,230
like just a lot of that anger was
coming out. It was just like, God, like,

204
00:12:35,231 --> 00:12:38,500
what the fuck I wanted to
fight. Everybody. I was like,
somebody gave me something,

205
00:12:38,501 --> 00:12:41,710
you know, and wow. Yeah. It was
just really terrible experience.

206
00:12:41,711 --> 00:12:46,240
But probably my lasted
three, four days. Not even,

207
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:50,190
maybe not even that. And then you came out
of it. Yeah. I mean, I was just like, eh,

208
00:12:50,191 --> 00:12:54,760
able to accept my fate and deal with it.
What does it feel like to be on mouth?

209
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:59,970
You would take Adderall. I had
never taken an Adderall. No, I'm

210
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:04,630
pretty similar to Adderall. Right?
Yeah. It's like Adderall. I mean,

211
00:13:04,631 --> 00:13:09,610
that's the closest I
would say. Um, I mean,

212
00:13:09,611 --> 00:13:12,520
you're high. Uh, but
you don't have, I mean,

213
00:13:12,521 --> 00:13:16,540
it says that euphoria more than
anything just to, excuse me.

214
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:21,130
Just an extreme sense of euphoria.
Just everything is beautiful.

215
00:13:21,131 --> 00:13:25,900
But then men, soon as you start
to lose that a little bit,

216
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:29,890
you just itch for, it's so bad, man,

217
00:13:29,891 --> 00:13:32,610
so bad that you just
want it again. You, you,

218
00:13:32,611 --> 00:13:37,500
you don't want to sleep like your teeth
to be grinding and you're just like, ah,

219
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:42,490
you're just tensing up all your muscles.
I God. Well, I got to get more of that,

220
00:13:42,491 --> 00:13:46,480
you know? Now, what are you working
out at all back then? No, well,

221
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:50,980
I take, well not working out
like it should be. So again,

222
00:13:50,981 --> 00:13:52,450
I was angry a lot of times.

223
00:13:52,451 --> 00:13:56,170
Like I'd be at a party that this was a
common thing I'd be at like a party or

224
00:13:56,171 --> 00:13:59,970
just doing drugs, whatever. And I just
started getting look at everybody,

225
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:03,400
like I don't like none of you.
And I would just walk outside and,

226
00:14:03,401 --> 00:14:07,540
and I would go for a run.
I'd run five, six miles, come
back and be like, all right,

227
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:12,380
give me another line or
whatever. Wow. Yeah. Um, and
run and then come back to the,

228
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:16,660
yeah. And then sometimes I would, I would
fight people, you know, that was common,

229
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:19,300
very,
very common if you call that working out.

230
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:25,510
And we,
like this particular time in my life,

231
00:14:25,511 --> 00:14:29,890
I was living in a little town called
Jamestown, Ohio. And I had this buddy,

232
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:34,720
he was friend, his cousin,
his cousin was a fighter.

233
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:36,580
And this was kind of my first

234
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:43,000
foray into mixed martial arts or first,
uh, experience watching it and everything.

235
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:47,990
And, uh, they would train in the
grass in the backyard. You know,

236
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:53,220
I remember watching Ken shamrock
DVDs are VHSs back then,

237
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:56,840
um, leg locks. We'd go
on the living room floor,

238
00:14:56,870 --> 00:15:00,410
like just be shit faced drunk and
login and tearing my ACL or anything.

239
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:04,460
Where I got, this is what he's doing is
how you do it. He'll, yeah, he'll hooks.

240
00:15:04,461 --> 00:15:07,490
And I mean, I don't remember all the
techniques, but I remember it was like,

241
00:15:07,491 --> 00:15:08,930
you know, pankration stuff, right?

242
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:13,040
And we just be laying there and
it was always a thought of like,

243
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:16,160
my dude is fucking awesome man.
Like I could beat tank habit,

244
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:21,170
you know? And we would joke
about it, man. We would say,

245
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:25,220
I remember specifically sitting in there
and be like, like, dude, like, you know,

246
00:15:25,221 --> 00:15:29,720
we're going to get you a fight in, uh, you
know, the local Joe Schmo show. And then,

247
00:15:29,721 --> 00:15:30,710
uh,
you know,

248
00:15:30,711 --> 00:15:33,290
we're going to get you up and you're
going to go to a pride and then you're

249
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:37,280
going to go to the UFC. And I was like,
oh, cool. The hell yeah, let's do it.

250
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:41,140
And that was, you know, it
was like a joke kind of,

251
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:44,690
but I like that was what was in my head.
That's, so that's what we're going to do.

252
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:49,400
Introduction to martial arts. Yeah. So
what was your first real formal training?

253
00:15:49,401 --> 00:15:52,730
Like what, what gym did you first,
so I fought before I trained.

254
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:57,370
She hit the fucking, yeah. Yeah. So,

255
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:02,130
so actually this, this guy that was a, um,

256
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:07,870
he was supposed to go fight West Simms
and his name was fat Joe has what we

257
00:16:08,031 --> 00:16:12,830
called him. He was supposed to go fight
Watson fat sims West sims that day.

258
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:16,280
And I said, yeah, let's go, man,
I don't want to go with you.

259
00:16:16,281 --> 00:16:19,420
I want to see that shit up close.
Right. And so we go there and, uh, I'm,

260
00:16:19,421 --> 00:16:22,070
I'm doing a bunch of coke
on the way and you know,

261
00:16:22,071 --> 00:16:24,560
to me it's just going to be a party.
Like I'm just gonna Watch my dude fight.

262
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:27,530
I get there and uh,
you know,

263
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:32,530
he signs up on the table and I was
like, dude, what is that? How, you know,

264
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:35,330
that's all you got to do. He's like,
yeah, he's like, you just paid 30 bucks.

265
00:16:35,331 --> 00:16:39,290
And He'd come by. I said, man, maybe
I should do that. And then the guy,

266
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:42,480
and I'm looking inside and
I see the, uh, you know,

267
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,600
people sitting around smoking cigars,
like you see on a movie,

268
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:49,130
people smoked cigars, you see bets
being made and stuff. And, and uh,

269
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,870
the guy who was men,
you want to fight the champion,

270
00:16:50,871 --> 00:16:55,100
like nobody wants to fight him. And I
was like, fuck yeah, man, I'll fight him.

271
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:57,890
You kidding me?
So I literally went across the street,

272
00:16:57,891 --> 00:17:01,000
there's a sporting goods store across the
street or down the street or something.

273
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:04,970
Went and bought a mouthpiece, come back,
there's a restaurant across the street,

274
00:17:04,971 --> 00:17:08,690
boiled the mouthpiece at the restaurant,
use their microwave, come back. And then,

275
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,430
uh,
and then we're at the fighters meeting.

276
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:13,850
So the fighters meeting back then was a
lot different. So there wasn't a way in,

277
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:18,730
it was like, you and you guys look about
the same size. You guys doing kickboxing,

278
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:21,830
okay, you guys fight, right? So
that's how the way it worked out.

279
00:17:21,831 --> 00:17:24,590
And I'm sitting there and they're
like, okay, you're the champion.

280
00:17:24,591 --> 00:17:28,420
You're fighting him. And I was like, Oh
shit. All right, fuck this motherfucker.

281
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:33,440
Right. And uh, you know, so,
um, [inaudible] this guy, he
taught me how to do a jab.

282
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:36,080
He's like, man, he's like, all you
gotta do to beat this guy. Just Jab him.

283
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:40,100
He's like, you see this, just don't
just jab. I was like, Oh, okay,

284
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:44,030
I'm going to do that. And uh, went out
there and I beat the guy. So he actually,

285
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:47,600
yeah, he actually quit, you know, so he
was a tough man. Champion is what he was.

286
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:53,130
And, uh, I actually do a jab, punch him
in the face and he went to shoot a on me.

287
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:57,330
I did, you know, uh, uh, playground,
guillotine choke, and he just quit.

288
00:17:57,390 --> 00:17:59,160
I don't think I actually had
the choke in and I don't,

289
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:04,250
I highly doubt he tapped out
saying that his calf cramped up.

290
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:10,580
I have no idea. Like, wow,
it really happened. I mean,

291
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:15,480
I certainly didn't know a good teen it
even know the name of it. So, uh, anyway,

292
00:18:15,481 --> 00:18:18,750
later that night, he was like, dude,
like your fight didn't go very long.

293
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:22,920
You will fight again. Yeah, whatever man.
And they said, well, this guy, you know,

294
00:18:22,921 --> 00:18:27,750
he's going pro and his next boxing match,
your kickboxer let's fight him.

295
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,830
Said, all right, I'll fuck him up. Right.

296
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:34,470
Because Dude beat the shit out of them.
So that was actually the first,

297
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:37,440
the nice thing about that was it
actually made me realize how tough I am.

298
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:40,530
That was the saving grace.
I mean, he just, you know,

299
00:18:40,531 --> 00:18:43,620
just pieced me up just one
punch after another, you know,

300
00:18:43,621 --> 00:18:48,480
I'm just eating punch after punch and
then, uh, yeah, that was it. I said, man,

301
00:18:48,481 --> 00:18:52,910
I gotta do this shit. And then, so
my second fight, uh, I, you know,

302
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:56,820
I didn't think I still yet needed
to train. Uh, my second fight,

303
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,700
I met a guy at a gym, so, you know,

304
00:18:59,701 --> 00:19:04,380
I did go to this gym was a
Japanese Jujitsu Gym, and he
goes, and he goes, hey man,

305
00:19:04,381 --> 00:19:08,750
you want to fight in like two weeks
in Moy Tai? Hell yeah. Right. Um,

306
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:13,620
so for two weeks, you know, I'd hit the
bag probably for five minutes at a time,

307
00:19:13,621 --> 00:19:18,540
whatever or something. Um, I
go to the fight and, uh, man,

308
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:24,540
this is the worst part. So I get in
there, first thing he got does, comes in,

309
00:19:24,541 --> 00:19:27,990
shoots on me. It takes me down. We're
in big gloves, uh, Shin pads on us.

310
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:32,540
It takes me down. I'll get up, look
at what the fuck he's taking me down.

311
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:36,480
We can't do this more time. Right. Uh,
music fight, you know, it comes in,

312
00:19:36,481 --> 00:19:40,950
it takes me down again. I was like,
what the fuck man. So I was like, okay,

313
00:19:40,951 --> 00:19:42,020
so we're fucking wrestling,
right?

314
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:44,760
So I come out and get in sort of a
wrestling stance, dropped my hands,

315
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:48,270
fucking kicks me in my head. So, uh,

316
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:52,740
we'll come find out later saying
Shao no tie. Scott Shealy show.

317
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,510
What are you studying?
I used to work with them a lot.

318
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:59,130
San Chow for people don't know was
a kickboxing with take downs. Yup.

319
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:03,940
Corner Corey Smith back in the day
when Maurice was doing that once. Yeah,

320
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:09,330
in Burbank, I think it was, it was
weird. It was confusing. It's like,

321
00:20:09,331 --> 00:20:12,300
okay.
I mean it's interesting I guess.

322
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,370
I mean it's probably a
good skillset to learn,

323
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:18,630
learn how to do take downs and
throws with, with kickboxing.

324
00:20:18,631 --> 00:20:22,310
But then you just let the guy up, which
was just weird. You didn't get it, Huh?

325
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:25,960
He was weird. Yeah. Yeah. I mean it
still goes on day. Sandon essentially.

326
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:28,320
I think it's amazing sport.
I love it. It's amazing.

327
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:32,570
And it's only a lot of times it's a
lot like throws in Moy Tai Cause you,

328
00:20:32,571 --> 00:20:35,080
you know, there's a lot of
trips and throws and Moy Tai,

329
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:41,010
except you get points for
the throws up to five. Yeah.

330
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:45,770
Another variation. Yeah.
If like their feet go above
their head, it's five points.

331
00:20:45,771 --> 00:20:48,670
So when did you get serious?
So you did this was right after that.

332
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:53,180
Cause I mean he'd beat the
shit out of me. Um, I like,

333
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,260
I remember walking out of there and
people were looking at me like, damn,

334
00:20:56,261 --> 00:20:58,320
how'd you survive hat bra?
I mean,

335
00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:00,340
and like people were actually
asking me how I like, Dude,

336
00:21:00,341 --> 00:21:05,290
how'd you survive that shit?
I don't know. I had to,

337
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,930
I had to go to work that night and
I was like working third shift.

338
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:11,500
I got to go to work right after everybody
was looking at me at work. I did.

339
00:21:11,501 --> 00:21:14,200
You got like two black eyes if,
anyway,

340
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:20,080
that was when I said to myself, you
know, I want to try this and you know,

341
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:24,580
I think, uh, you know, this is something I
really enjoy and I want to go for it. Um,

342
00:21:24,581 --> 00:21:25,660
so I met this guy,

343
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:29,830
his name was Eli airs and he was
fighting and king of the cage,

344
00:21:29,831 --> 00:21:32,680
one of the toughest guys I've ever met.
And then guy brainwork workman and uh,

345
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:36,760
they were training for, it was a
big show there in Columbus. Um,

346
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:38,740
I can't remember the name of show,

347
00:21:38,741 --> 00:21:42,310
but I think like Lawler fought on it like
a bunch of military guys. Tim Silvia,

348
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:48,550
you know the name, if I said, I can't
remember. But anyway, um, yeah. And then,

349
00:21:48,551 --> 00:21:52,150
you know, then I really got the shit
kicked out on me when I got in the gym,

350
00:21:52,151 --> 00:21:57,130
you know, then I realized like, you know
what a real beating was and uh, yeah,

351
00:21:57,131 --> 00:21:58,460
it just went from there man.
Cause I,

352
00:21:58,461 --> 00:22:01,810
I just said I never looked back
and I thought, man, you know,

353
00:22:01,811 --> 00:22:04,360
I want to change my life.
You know, I'm, I'm, you know,

354
00:22:04,361 --> 00:22:07,750
I wasn't never actually a,
uh,

355
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:14,440
the type of person that fit in
with the drug user seen. Right.

356
00:22:14,441 --> 00:22:16,660
Like that wasn't me. It was just a, again,

357
00:22:16,661 --> 00:22:21,640
an expression of anger and
these things that, um, you know,

358
00:22:21,930 --> 00:22:26,890
in my childhood just kind of came out the
wrong way. Right. So it wasn't really,

359
00:22:26,891 --> 00:22:30,870
uh, like I fit in there.
So at this point, like I'm,

360
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:32,590
I'm really not fitting in anywhere.

361
00:22:32,591 --> 00:22:35,530
And this was a quote that
I remember where I said,

362
00:22:35,531 --> 00:22:38,370
I stopped trying to find yourself
and start to define yourself. And,

363
00:22:38,371 --> 00:22:42,280
and I felt like the whole
time I was trying to find
myself and I said, you know,

364
00:22:42,281 --> 00:22:46,240
I'm a, I'm a define who the fuck I am.
I'm going to say, this is what I am.

365
00:22:46,241 --> 00:22:50,670
This is what I do. I'm a fighter.
Fuck it. Let's go. It's do or die. Um,

366
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:56,240
I've been to jail and dad, I've
been, you know, I've slept in on,

367
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:59,350
in the fucking snow, you know what
I mean? Like I've been homeless,

368
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:01,420
I've done every low thing you can do.

369
00:23:01,421 --> 00:23:03,940
Like what's the worst that could happen
and get knocked out. There's nothing.

370
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:06,640
So I decided,
you know,

371
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:10,990
this is my path and I'm gonna carve the
path. I'm not going to search for a path.

372
00:23:10,991 --> 00:23:14,920
I'm going to make the path and I'm not
going to look back and I'm going to the

373
00:23:14,921 --> 00:23:16,600
top of that mountain. And, uh,

374
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:21,610
and that's something I still talk about
today when I talk to people is about, uh,

375
00:23:21,611 --> 00:23:23,560
I didn't have any idea
how I was going to do it,

376
00:23:23,561 --> 00:23:26,020
but I knew why I was going to do it.
And I knew that I was going to do it.

377
00:23:26,021 --> 00:23:30,090
And I think I'm in my own personal
struggles and I think in a lot of people

378
00:23:30,091 --> 00:23:32,710
struggle is they kind of get
caught up in the how, you know,

379
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,810
how am I going to do this? How am
I gonna win this fight, whatever.

380
00:23:34,811 --> 00:23:37,180
And I think when you know
and understand your why,

381
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:41,830
I think the how becomes a
lot more um, clear, clear.

382
00:23:41,831 --> 00:23:45,610
Yeah. More clear and easier. I
mean, it doesn't matter. You can do,

383
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:48,500
it's better to do it 100% wrong then 50%.
Right?

384
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:52,160
I think there's a balance to doing things
and it's highlighted by what you just

385
00:23:52,161 --> 00:23:53,300
said,
what you've just said.

386
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:57,960
There's a balance and it's a lot of what
we were talking about earlier about uh,

387
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Joel Jamison versus Louie Simmons versus
like someone who's like super technical

388
00:24:03,231 --> 00:24:07,070
versus someone who's just a fucking mad
dog and just wants you to just go out

389
00:24:07,071 --> 00:24:09,290
and do it and don't be a pussy.
Your,

390
00:24:09,291 --> 00:24:14,120
your mindset that allowed you to take
that fight with no training and then take

391
00:24:14,121 --> 00:24:17,060
another fight after that with no training
and then take another flight out to

392
00:24:17,061 --> 00:24:20,360
that would know. T just this mindset
of fuck it, let's just do this.

393
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:27,830
There's a balance between that
and then you realizing, okay,

394
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,250
I got to really learn how to do this.
If I'm going to really be a fighter,

395
00:24:31,251 --> 00:24:36,251
I'm going to be really be really defined
myself and I'll really go out and make

396
00:24:36,321 --> 00:24:40,340
a mark. I got to learn what the fuck I'm
doing. Exactly this both things there.

397
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:45,130
That's that balance. Like you need both
things, you know, I mean it's, it's,

398
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,500
you have to have a certain amount
of fuck it in you, you know,

399
00:24:48,501 --> 00:24:52,210
you have to have a certain amount
for a sport. I mean, is it,

400
00:24:52,211 --> 00:24:55,070
he called an MMA a sport.
It always seemed to me to be,

401
00:24:56,510 --> 00:25:01,250
it's too,
it's too defining.

402
00:25:01,251 --> 00:25:05,060
It's its or to, uh,
it's, it's too limited.

403
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:07,400
It's not fighting is more than a sport.

404
00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:11,780
It's an expression of what you're
capable of. Absolutely. It's,

405
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:14,090
you are you who you are as a human.

406
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:18,340
And that's where a one distinction I've
made over the years is the difference

407
00:25:18,341 --> 00:25:20,390
between Marshall Skills and martial arts.
Everything.

408
00:25:20,430 --> 00:25:23,920
Everybody always calls everything
and copies it into a martial art.

409
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:28,240
And when we go to the gym and we're
training armbars do a hundred arm bars.

410
00:25:28,241 --> 00:25:29,074
That's not art.

411
00:25:29,170 --> 00:25:34,030
That's not your expression of
your body in a combat scenario.

412
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:38,230
That's a, that's a martial skill.
Now when we go in competition,

413
00:25:38,231 --> 00:25:41,440
now we're expressing our R and I think
this is an important distinction to be

414
00:25:41,441 --> 00:25:45,370
made. I think it's something that, uh,
I get so tired of hearing, you know,

415
00:25:45,371 --> 00:25:47,230
I trained martial arts and you know,

416
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:49,870
I trained martial skills
and then I express my art.

417
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:51,950
That's a very interesting
way of putting it.

418
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:57,200
How many years after you initially started
seriously training where you on the

419
00:25:57,201 --> 00:26:00,650
ultimate fighter? Uh, four or five.

420
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:04,490
I remember when you were on the ultimate
fighter and they stole your chew

421
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:06,830
somebody fuck treat.
Everybody remembers him. Well,

422
00:26:06,831 --> 00:26:09,760
I remembered that because I remember
like there's some dudes that,

423
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:12,320
there's some guys that play tough guy.

424
00:26:12,650 --> 00:26:16,700
There's some guys that put on a show and
puff up their chest and say some shit

425
00:26:16,701 --> 00:26:18,590
that they might not necessarily mean.

426
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:22,400
And then there's some guys that
say some shit and you go, oh,

427
00:26:22,670 --> 00:26:24,230
this dude's fucking serious.

428
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:28,340
When they fucked with your
kid or with your shoe.

429
00:26:28,341 --> 00:26:32,030
I remember watching that and go,
this motherfucker serious. I'm like,

430
00:26:32,031 --> 00:26:36,270
Matt Brown is not a joker.
And then when you fought Matt Arroyo,

431
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:40,670
that was a another example of
it. I'm like, there's skill
wise Mike matter royals,

432
00:26:40,671 --> 00:26:44,130
a very talented guy and
still is good Jujitsu guy,

433
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:48,670
good fighter. But there was
something that was a battle of mines.

434
00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:50,400
I agree your mind,

435
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,360
I don't know if you knew that I fought
him before that too. Yeah. Yeah.

436
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:56,200
But the first time I fought,
and this is why it was such a,

437
00:26:56,370 --> 00:27:00,370
a no brainer to say to fight. I fought
him the first time on 24 hours notice.

438
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,930
So I wasn't even,

439
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:06,340
I wasn't training her and I was training
a girl and she was going to Florida to

440
00:27:06,341 --> 00:27:09,070
fight.
And when I got there,

441
00:27:09,071 --> 00:27:12,070
we're driving to the weigh
ins and the promoter,

442
00:27:12,071 --> 00:27:15,640
I heard him talking on the phone and he
goes, and I heard him say, you know, oh,

443
00:27:15,641 --> 00:27:18,580
we don't have an opponent for
him. Uh, so I said, hey, you know,

444
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:22,670
what do you need opponent for? And
he's like, wow, this Guy Matt Arroyo,

445
00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:27,780
one 70. And I said, dude, I'll fight
how much we pay me. They're like,

446
00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:32,320
I have 400 500 bucks. I was like, dude,
I pay my rent. Fuck yeah, I'll do it.

447
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:35,740
And um, yeah, so, and I said, you know,

448
00:27:35,741 --> 00:27:40,090
I can't make weight because I got like
one hour and uh, you know, he said it,

449
00:27:40,091 --> 00:27:42,750
he said it's cool and fight them
on 24 hours notice and beat him.

450
00:27:42,751 --> 00:27:46,250
So he wanted redemption for that.
Yeah.

451
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:48,840
That fight was an you,

452
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:52,580
one of the things about like watching
you fight to someone who's seen a lot of

453
00:27:52,581 --> 00:27:57,410
people fight. There's, there's moments
in exchanges were after the exchange, uh,

454
00:27:57,411 --> 00:28:02,330
gow tried to take a break or gow try
to catch his breath or move pace and

455
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:05,150
bigotry break. Yeah.
There's little breaks.

456
00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:09,440
And then there's guys who recognize
those breaks and push in and you're a guy

457
00:28:09,441 --> 00:28:12,890
who pushes in. Absolutely. When there's a
break you're like, oh no, mother fucker,

458
00:28:12,891 --> 00:28:14,630
there's no breaks here.
There's no breaks here.

459
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:18,910
And you just get on dudes and it
makes things very intense. Yeah.

460
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:23,000
That's the thing about all your fights.
They're very intense. You know, there's a,

461
00:28:23,001 --> 00:28:26,780
there's a certain level of violence that
you bring into the octagon that someone

462
00:28:26,781 --> 00:28:29,120
has to be prepared for.
You know,

463
00:28:29,121 --> 00:28:32,780
and there's some guys that are prepared
for it and it makes for amazing fights

464
00:28:32,781 --> 00:28:36,830
like your fight Robbie Lawler. Holy
Shit. Was that a crazy fight? You know?

465
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:39,260
And then there's guys who just,
they just can't keep the pace.

466
00:28:39,290 --> 00:28:41,930
They just can't keep that
than keeping you off of them.

467
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:44,800
Yeah. And uh, well I think what, um,

468
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:50,140
my goal as a martial artist,
as a fighter Marshall,

469
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:53,400
uh, you know, whatever you would
call a combat guy, you know,

470
00:28:53,401 --> 00:28:56,970
I had to get my skills up to
the point where not your mind,

471
00:28:56,971 --> 00:29:00,810
where it matches the mind.
Yeah. And crazy. Yeah. I mean,

472
00:29:00,811 --> 00:29:05,811
a lot of guys struggle the other way and
I think one of the things that I talk

473
00:29:06,721 --> 00:29:11,100
about a lot that you see, I don't think
that I was necessarily born this way.

474
00:29:11,610 --> 00:29:16,560
This is where I think a lot of
people get confused. I mean,

475
00:29:16,561 --> 00:29:20,220
I was certainly born with an
inclination towards a fighting.

476
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:25,140
I wouldn't be where I'm at
without that. But, you know, uh,

477
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:30,000
I work a lot on my mind.
I do a lot of stuff.

478
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:36,080
I've always been obsessed with
martial arts and combat as a whole.

479
00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:39,690
And I hear other people say
they're obsessed. Like Connor,

480
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,770
you made it really famous when
he started saying it. Right.

481
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:46,660
I think my obsession goes far, far
beyond what anybody's even even close to.

482
00:29:46,661 --> 00:29:51,410
I don't think they're there. A definition
of obsession even, uh, even, uh,

483
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:55,390
is comparable to mine at all. I
mean, I'm, I'm far more obsessed.

484
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:59,170
I've read probably I got a library
of sports psychology, books of,

485
00:29:59,171 --> 00:30:03,590
of strength conditioning, books of a
martial arts, books, all this stuff. Um,

486
00:30:04,530 --> 00:30:05,980
I mean it's literally on
my mind 24 hours a day,

487
00:30:05,981 --> 00:30:09,130
but one of the things I really focus
on is the, the sports psychology part.

488
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:14,760
And I think that is why it's
expressed that way in the fight.

489
00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:19,700
Um, and you hear a lot of people, they'll
say, how long have, have you heard like,

490
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:22,990
men, you know, my mind's already strong.
Like, I ain't scared when I walk in.

491
00:30:22,991 --> 00:30:27,280
There are stupid shit like that.
And, and I always say, you know,

492
00:30:27,281 --> 00:30:29,560
do you think Michael Jordan
stopped Paxton lay ups?

493
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:32,470
Do you think Jordan Burroughs
stopped practicing double eggs?

494
00:30:32,471 --> 00:30:37,390
Do you think that on a shorts and niggers
stopped doing bicep curls because it's

495
00:30:37,391 --> 00:30:39,970
good, doesn't mean that you stopped. Yeah,

496
00:30:39,971 --> 00:30:42,550
it can be improved upon
it and you don't stop. So,

497
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:47,620
and I think the mind is one of those
things that can always be better.

498
00:30:47,621 --> 00:30:49,580
Like we're not tapping into,
I mean,

499
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,330
what are we talking to like 10%
of our brains. That's all blessed.

500
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:54,740
Yeah, that's, yeah, that's bullshit.
You know, they used to think that.

501
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:58,610
They used to think that they used to it.
That's something they say.

502
00:30:58,670 --> 00:31:03,670
But the reality is your brain has a bunch
of different quadrants for all sorts

503
00:31:03,861 --> 00:31:04,694
of different functions.

504
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:08,270
So when you know you're utilizing
a certain portion of your brain,

505
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:12,290
that's the portion of your brain that's
responsible for those actions. Okay.

506
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:13,670
There's not either way.

507
00:31:13,671 --> 00:31:18,080
I know our minds are certainly far more
unlimited and far more potential than

508
00:31:18,081 --> 00:31:21,050
we're tapping into.
I think your mind is a lot like your body.

509
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:24,680
And it performs and it
does what you ask of it.

510
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,630
And if you just are lazy pitch,

511
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,960
he doesn't do anything but sit around
and watch TV and you don't ever challenge

512
00:31:29,961 --> 00:31:33,990
your mind. I think your mind is weak
and it atrophies. Absolutely. Yeah.

513
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:35,530
When you say that you,

514
00:31:35,531 --> 00:31:38,090
you have all these books and you
say that you work on your mind,

515
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:42,620
like do you have a, a daily practice
that you do? Do you meditate? I meditate.

516
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:47,060
Um, you know, daily is sort of a, uh,

517
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:50,900
I hate saying I do it daily cause
you know, I skipped days and,

518
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:54,960
and I mean I have three kids, which, you
know how that goes and yeah, it's very,

519
00:31:55,550 --> 00:31:56,340
um,

520
00:31:56,340 --> 00:32:01,340
but at the same time I try
to use everything as an
opportunity to practice on my

521
00:32:01,651 --> 00:32:06,510
mind too. Right. Um, um, how you do
anything is how you do everything.

522
00:32:06,511 --> 00:32:10,130
Right. Right. Um, and
so I think, you know,

523
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:14,490
we can use opportunities all
the time and uh, but yes,

524
00:32:14,491 --> 00:32:18,580
I do meditate, I do tons of
visualization. I have a, um,

525
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:21,660
my strength conditioning
coach I work with now, he's a,

526
00:32:21,661 --> 00:32:23,520
he's also got degree in sports psychology,

527
00:32:23,521 --> 00:32:27,840
so we integrate a lot of that in the
training itself. Uh, for instance,

528
00:32:27,841 --> 00:32:28,590
like doing,

529
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:32,500
we do these 200 yard sprints on the forest
treadmill or they're just miserable.

530
00:32:32,501 --> 00:32:35,820
That, I mean, by the time you're done,
you just don't have anything left.

531
00:32:35,821 --> 00:32:39,710
It's a complete drain. And then as soon
as you're done, like if stand attention,

532
00:32:39,770 --> 00:32:41,270
right, I have to stay in, you know,

533
00:32:41,271 --> 00:32:45,980
like a military attention straight
up and down and not let the, uh,

534
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:46,903
the,

535
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:52,180
the concept of your body's shutting
down affect your ability to maintain a

536
00:32:52,191 --> 00:32:54,200
posture. Right? And that's
just a mental thing, you know,

537
00:32:54,201 --> 00:32:58,100
100% right is solely mental. You
know, that's just one example.

538
00:32:58,130 --> 00:33:00,530
We do a million things like
that. Um, but yeah, I do,

539
00:33:00,531 --> 00:33:05,090
I do tons and tons of visualization,
which is, uh, uh, consistent,

540
00:33:05,870 --> 00:33:10,370
uh, marker of high performers are
consistent thing that high performers do.

541
00:33:10,670 --> 00:33:14,680
I think this is a well
known. Um, I have a,

542
00:33:14,681 --> 00:33:18,770
a mental coach specifically that kind
of holds me accountable for a lot of the

543
00:33:18,771 --> 00:33:23,570
things, you know, me and him,
we talk a lot back and forth
about the different, uh,

544
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:28,790
the different ways to create habits.

545
00:33:28,850 --> 00:33:32,010
I think that's probably the number one
thing is creating habits. Right. Um,

546
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:35,000
you know, but, you know, he holds me
accountable for everything and not take,

547
00:33:35,001 --> 00:33:39,830
that's probably the biggest key is just
being held accountable for every action

548
00:33:39,831 --> 00:33:43,280
that you do. Have you ever used a sensory
deprivation tank? Absolutely. My, uh,

549
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:45,890
my strength coach has one.
Beautiful. Yeah, I love it.

550
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:50,540
And I go in about 45 to an hour,
um, to work on shit in there.

551
00:33:50,541 --> 00:33:55,130
Do you think about techniques?
Um, you know, I don't really, uh,

552
00:33:55,160 --> 00:34:00,080
I used that as a time, so I, I, I tried to
practice this form of meditation that I,

553
00:34:00,690 --> 00:34:04,280
you know, I can't remember the name
of it. This dude, um, Kish tomorrow.

554
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,950
You ever heard of him? Krishnamacharya? I,

555
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:09,050
I don't know why it's not
coming to my head right now,

556
00:34:09,051 --> 00:34:10,610
but he was one of Bruce Lee's guys.

557
00:34:10,611 --> 00:34:14,420
He's an Indian metta meditation
guy and everything. And, um,

558
00:34:14,570 --> 00:34:18,620
his form of meditation was to
completely clear your mind,

559
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:22,100
which is I guess like is
actually impossible, right?

560
00:34:22,101 --> 00:34:24,170
Like there's no way to just
have no thought at all,

561
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:29,710
but that's sort of what I try to strive
for is go literally no mind at all.

562
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:32,990
What I do is think about only my breath.
That's it.

563
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:35,300
I concentrate on my
breathing in and not do that.

564
00:34:35,301 --> 00:34:37,160
And there's a bunch of other
shit that gets in there,

565
00:34:37,430 --> 00:34:42,110
but eventually I can kind of overpower
it and just think only about breathing in

566
00:34:42,410 --> 00:34:46,760
and out. So that's what I do
to get to that state, right?

567
00:34:46,761 --> 00:34:50,240
To get to a state where I can release
everything. But at that point,

568
00:34:50,470 --> 00:34:54,470
once something, I'm relaxed, then
I go for the, uh, the no mine,

569
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:58,730
which again is that it's impossible.
But, um, my personal, uh,

570
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:03,760
system of visualization or relaxation
is I see the thoughts as clouds and the,

571
00:35:05,241 --> 00:35:08,510
my mind is a sky or space. So, you know,

572
00:35:08,511 --> 00:35:13,511
my mind becomes this gigantic entity and
the thoughts are just clouds that pass

573
00:35:14,601 --> 00:35:17,630
by. But again, when I start
thinking about things like that,

574
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:19,760
now you're not in the know mine.
If you start thinking about your breath,

575
00:35:19,761 --> 00:35:23,540
you're not in the know mine and I want
to get as close to it as possible because

576
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:27,170
in a fight, in a combat
situation, I want no mind.

577
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:31,760
That's the as the way that
Musashi talks about, right? Yeah,

578
00:35:32,170 --> 00:35:35,810
and that's customer Sasha right
there. Oh fuck. Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

579
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,980
This was a play on massage.

580
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:44,940
Have you read the Book Musashi?
Yeah. Yeah. Read that. You
put it on the day. Yeah.

581
00:35:44,941 --> 00:35:48,650
I read that and I read the book of five
rings when I was 16 changed my life.

582
00:35:49,110 --> 00:35:52,080
That's the one that Louie will,
if you work for Louis,

583
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:56,460
all of his staff to read it.
Yeah. You have to meet it, dude.

584
00:35:56,461 --> 00:35:59,460
Once you understand broadly,
you could see it in all things.

585
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:04,170
I remember reading that when I was 16 and
I was like, ah, I get it. I was like, you,

586
00:36:04,171 --> 00:36:08,310
when you, when you can get great at
something, you can get great at anything.

587
00:36:08,311 --> 00:36:09,330
It's the same thing,

588
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:13,650
whether it's playing the piano or
writing books or fighting or anything.

589
00:36:13,651 --> 00:36:18,510
It's the same thing. It's all about
figuring it out, understanding the way,

590
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:23,130
and that's a, the book, the art of
learning. If you read this one, no,

591
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:28,160
Josh Waitzkin the chess prodigy is
a black belt under Marcello Garcia.

592
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:32,520
Yeah. Beautiful. Amazing Book.
That's sort of a similar type thing.

593
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:37,140
He's a fucking wizard man. I've heard him
on Tim Ferriss's podcast. Super Smart.

594
00:36:37,141 --> 00:36:41,880
God's where I heard of him from genius
and just so good at understanding how to

595
00:36:41,881 --> 00:36:45,630
learn things and teach things.
I think that mentality,

596
00:36:45,631 --> 00:36:47,940
that chess player mentality
cause chest assessor,

597
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,800
such a complex cognitive demanding game,
you know,

598
00:36:52,801 --> 00:36:56,550
there's so much thinking and planning
and so many steps ahead that you have to

599
00:36:56,551 --> 00:37:00,340
be in so many moves you have to have
cataloged in your head. And then,

600
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:03,780
and he goes into beyond
just the technical part too,

601
00:37:03,781 --> 00:37:07,940
when he talks about how he kind
of lost his love for, yeah,

602
00:37:07,990 --> 00:37:10,230
it was a great book, man. Yeah. Well,

603
00:37:10,231 --> 00:37:14,820
he's a really fascinating character
and I love when a guy like that gets

604
00:37:14,821 --> 00:37:19,350
obsessed with martial arts because it
changes the way people look at something

605
00:37:19,351 --> 00:37:22,740
like Jujitsu because people on the outside
in particular, they look at Jujitsu.

606
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:25,830
It's like, oh, it's just a bunch of
fucking meatheads choking each other.

607
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:28,740
And then they see a guy like that
and they go, oh, wait a minute,

608
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:32,920
Josh Waitzkin his industry.
He's a black belt, huh? That's,

609
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:35,350
that's gotta be one of the
great things about Jujitsu is a,

610
00:37:36,270 --> 00:37:40,620
the amazing people that do it. I mean,
he'd come out here to la and I mean,

611
00:37:40,621 --> 00:37:45,150
I see these people doing Jujitsu.
I talked to him like, Hey,

612
00:37:45,151 --> 00:37:48,930
what do you do? They're like, oh, you
know, I'm a movie, a top guy or whatever.

613
00:37:48,931 --> 00:37:53,190
I'm an executive, I'm a, I'm
a CEO. I'm like, wait, what?

614
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:57,540
What are you doing in here? Guy Ritchie
garbage. He's a fucking black belt.

615
00:37:57,930 --> 00:38:01,950
He was on the podcast. I was like, why
you're a black belt under Henzel? Like,

616
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:05,740
Holy Shit. Nice. Yeah,
that's legit, man. Let's go.

617
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:08,880
I'd ask God damn black and their Henzel
Gracie, they don't give those away.

618
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:12,360
Maynard James Keenan. Yup. Yup.
Oh, he's a buddy of mine. Yeah.

619
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:14,790
I mean I know him a little bit jealous.

620
00:38:14,791 --> 00:38:17,670
Fuck that dude does Jujitsu
and he's got a fake hip.

621
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:21,450
I didn't get a hip replacement
from stopping on stage. You know,

622
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:24,570
he's always stopping on stage and he
choke someone out on the stage. Yeah,

623
00:38:24,571 --> 00:38:25,680
he a hip toss.

624
00:38:25,681 --> 00:38:29,760
Some dude took his back and got him in
a rear naked choke on stage and kept

625
00:38:29,761 --> 00:38:34,270
singing and the dude was going like,
he wasn't hurting the guy. You know,

626
00:38:34,350 --> 00:38:36,160
the guy was a,
it was the whole thing

627
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:40,240
was kind of crazy.
Like most on youtube or does it define it?

628
00:38:40,450 --> 00:38:42,670
The guy comes up to the guy
runs up to months stage.

629
00:38:42,671 --> 00:38:46,540
Maynard has the fucking microphone in
his hand. Mainers another dude. He's,

630
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:49,390
he's one of the smartest dudes I noticed.
Stupid,

631
00:38:49,391 --> 00:38:50,950
smart to the point where he's kind of,

632
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:54,970
he kind of gets weird round people
cause it's so goddamn smart.

633
00:38:54,971 --> 00:38:57,790
Everybody else like a baby.
So here he's on stage.

634
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:02,980
You got a big screen and some dude,
some dude jumps onto the stage

635
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:07,120
and rushes him. Where's it at,
Jamie? How long has this video

636
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:11,960
got to get to when the
dude runs on stage there?

637
00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:16,220
Okay, get it, go before that,
cause he hip toss. He's like, look,

638
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:19,190
the guy runs up to me. He's like,
yeah, it made her hugs him. Boom.

639
00:39:20,870 --> 00:39:25,870
Takes back season show kit and he keeps
singing and then he goes over onto his

640
00:39:26,691 --> 00:39:31,580
back and pulls the guy backwards and
then keep singing while he's in full back

641
00:39:31,581 --> 00:39:34,070
mount with the hook and they do.
It's its arms. I'm like, yes,

642
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:38,750
I do.
That is beautiful.

643
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:40,400
And he kept saying the song,

644
00:39:40,730 --> 00:39:44,480
this guy's fucking hilarious
man is a god man. Yeah,

645
00:39:44,510 --> 00:39:47,690
he's a the fucker and he's always
training. He comes out here,

646
00:39:47,691 --> 00:39:49,630
he trains dot with them a little bit.

647
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:53,770
Henry Akins place and trades is
Dave Camera, Rio half Gracie.

648
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,940
He goes everywhere with
them a little bit out there.

649
00:39:55,941 --> 00:39:59,750
We were drilling a couple of weeks
ago over at Henry's Robin muscle farm.

650
00:39:59,751 --> 00:40:03,010
We did some training there
and most people, they get
their fucking hip replaced.

651
00:40:03,011 --> 00:40:05,150
They're like, that's a wrap,
right? Yeah. And he's like,

652
00:40:05,151 --> 00:40:09,770
I've got to get my black belt. Wow. Did
Mark Coleman had his hip replaced in?

653
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:13,070
He ain't even train
them right.

654
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:17,330
I think he may have had both of them
are the one where they call it had a

655
00:40:17,331 --> 00:40:22,310
problem. Yeah. I got infected. I had
to get redone. Imagine that Shit.

656
00:40:22,311 --> 00:40:25,760
They cut off the top of your leg.
They put a fake hip in there.

657
00:40:25,761 --> 00:40:29,630
They put a bolt that goes through the
center of the bone all the way down

658
00:40:29,631 --> 00:40:32,870
through the bone. Imagine have to
Redo that. They got to pull it out.

659
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:36,770
A new one in there. Fuck man.
Magic. Just doing it once.

660
00:40:36,771 --> 00:40:40,870
I've only had one surgery in my life. I've
only went under Bob 100 twice now. So,

661
00:40:42,090 --> 00:40:46,100
um, the actually so twice. Yeah. The first
one I had tore the ligament right here.

662
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:49,340
I remember that. Yeah. You
were talking about that.

663
00:40:49,370 --> 00:40:51,830
That was fucking with you
for a long time, right? Yeah.

664
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:56,030
Probably about a year I fought like that.
You couldn't totally make a fist, right?

665
00:40:56,060 --> 00:40:57,500
Yeah.
It was like this kind of,

666
00:40:57,620 --> 00:41:02,390
so I was like frog and people would call
still like that Hema calls broke his

667
00:41:02,391 --> 00:41:05,660
hand so much that his right hand,
one of his knuckles,

668
00:41:05,661 --> 00:41:10,130
like his pinky or is a pointer finger
and it never curls past that. Yeah.

669
00:41:10,131 --> 00:41:12,530
Well this wasn't broken.
The bones were all intact,

670
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:17,830
but the ligament there was completely
torn. So what they have to do. Um,

671
00:41:17,910 --> 00:41:22,160
and I just went in like there's a decision
there and just reattach the ligament.

672
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:26,270
And I came back probably
four months later,

673
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:29,810
five months later maybe that's when
they were telling me you'll be fine and

674
00:41:29,811 --> 00:41:34,040
everything. And you know it took
probably a year before was actually okay.

675
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:38,420
Wow. It's just Chris Weidman's going
through some shit like that right now.

676
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:42,170
He fucked his thumb up in the Kelvin
Gasol and fight and then had to get a

677
00:41:42,171 --> 00:41:47,171
ligament from his wrist taken out and
attached to his thumb cause his thumbs

678
00:41:47,331 --> 00:41:52,080
regiment was torn and he still
can't fully train. Still can't grip.

679
00:41:52,090 --> 00:41:55,610
We're fully punch. Yeah, he's
waiting. Yeah. Mine. They
did have dude, none of that.

680
00:41:55,611 --> 00:41:58,010
But they,
they said once they open it up,

681
00:41:58,340 --> 00:42:02,810
there was a lot more stuff in there they
had to take out and a lot more that was

682
00:42:02,811 --> 00:42:04,670
ripped that they didn't
even realize was there.

683
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:08,060
You know how it is with cord
Mris. Yeah. Well with fighters,

684
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:11,270
like so many guys have shit
wrong. They don't even know. Like,

685
00:42:11,271 --> 00:42:15,290
did you ever see Jacques Arrays when
they had his, uh, elbows cleaned out?

686
00:42:16,170 --> 00:42:20,960
He had elbow surgery and they found
chunks of bone and cartilage in his elbow.

687
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:21,950
Like, uh, like,

688
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:27,780
like a shot glass filled with like shit
really floating around inside of his

689
00:42:27,801 --> 00:42:31,490
elbow just from hitting people with
elbows and getting arm barred and not

690
00:42:31,491 --> 00:42:36,491
tapping and shit pop and snap and Taryn
loose and all of it is just fucking

691
00:42:37,131 --> 00:42:41,370
mangled. Yeah. Cause he broke his
arm when he's hydro. Hydro. Yeah.

692
00:42:41,770 --> 00:42:45,410
Broke his arm. He tucked it into his
belt and kept going. It's bad ass.

693
00:42:46,850 --> 00:42:49,310
I mean that was a horrible
arm break to like, to me,

694
00:42:49,311 --> 00:42:53,240
wrestling is the hardest
sport in the world. And I
love rest. I love watching it.

695
00:42:53,241 --> 00:42:58,040
I love being a part of it. Yeah. Um, but
that doesn't happen in wrestler, right?

696
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:01,400
Very often. I mean, I guess
there's probably some, I know, uh,

697
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:06,460
Mike Passilla went to the
finals with a torn Pec.

698
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:12,230
Wow. Yeah. So thanks a lot. It takes a
lot. I guess it does happen in wrestling.

699
00:43:12,230 --> 00:43:15,800
I shouldn't say that. That's a
different, that situation was just,

700
00:43:15,801 --> 00:43:18,980
he was up on points and he just needed
to survive for a couple of the match,

701
00:43:18,981 --> 00:43:20,870
right? Yup. Yup. One of the match,

702
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:26,000
but we'll remember when Jon Jones fought
Vitor Vitara completely hyper extended

703
00:43:26,001 --> 00:43:30,530
his arm. That was when, I don't know if it
broke. It was fucked up for a long time.

704
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:34,970
I mean it was bent like this the other
way, just completely back backwards.

705
00:43:34,971 --> 00:43:37,690
Like I was convinced he was going
to tap. I was like, he's got a tap.

706
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:41,750
I thought it was two v toward like, let it
go a little. Yeah. I think he let it go.

707
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:45,560
It was weird. Yeah, I remember
that. Yeah. And I'm like,

708
00:43:47,370 --> 00:43:52,260
thank you. If it, if he finishes
that crazy, the world changes.

709
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:56,690
Yeah. The whole world of light heavyweight
changes be towards life changes. Yeah.

710
00:43:56,780 --> 00:44:00,920
Everything changes. Veto becomes a
champ, you know, the whole thing changes.

711
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:05,560
John Jones, not the greatest ever. Yeah.
Which you know, is a up in the air,

712
00:44:05,570 --> 00:44:08,120
whatever. But I think he's the
greatest ever performance wise.

713
00:44:08,121 --> 00:44:11,240
We were talking about performance wise
earlier before the podcast started and

714
00:44:11,241 --> 00:44:14,150
versus like we're talking about
Cain Velasquez performance wise,

715
00:44:14,151 --> 00:44:19,151
like the actual results versus
what you think about their ability.

716
00:44:20,210 --> 00:44:22,100
You know,
I think cane when he was at the time,

717
00:44:22,130 --> 00:44:26,240
I never saw anybody with a cane when
he was in his prime, 240 pounds.

718
00:44:26,241 --> 00:44:30,260
Unfucking godly cardio,
we just never stopped coming at you.

719
00:44:30,530 --> 00:44:32,190
Excellent technique.

720
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:33,080
Take it tremendous.

721
00:44:33,730 --> 00:44:38,190
My whole thing with it though is
as soon as you test positive once,

722
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:41,670
I'd take you out of the greatest PR.
It's just against the rules.

723
00:44:41,671 --> 00:44:44,800
I'm not even against steroids. Like
take steroids, you know, like if,

724
00:44:44,810 --> 00:44:48,630
if it's your endocrinologist tells you
to take steroids, go fucking do it. Good.

725
00:44:48,930 --> 00:44:51,870
Good for you. But in our sport,
unfortunately it's against the rules.

726
00:44:51,871 --> 00:44:56,130
So there's only a certain amount of
people doing it. So if you're doing it,

727
00:44:56,131 --> 00:45:00,030
you're cheating. Right. And,
but do you think John was
taking steroid? I don't know.

728
00:45:00,370 --> 00:45:05,370
I don't, I don't think he was, but to be
honest, it doesn't matter to me. I mean,

729
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:08,520
you know, I've said this for a long time.
I think it should be a lifetime ban.

730
00:45:08,550 --> 00:45:12,300
First offense period. Yeah. And
there's going to be martyrs.

731
00:45:12,301 --> 00:45:14,940
There would be guys like, I don't
think 10 means was taking steroids.

732
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:18,930
He certainly did not look like
it did. It wasn't, Oh really?

733
00:45:18,931 --> 00:45:20,000
I didn't know what that far,
okay.

734
00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:22,390
Okay.
So found the supplement that he was taken,

735
00:45:22,391 --> 00:45:25,340
there was a totally legal supplement.
You get a bunch of shit,

736
00:45:25,690 --> 00:45:30,140
but companies or these companies
rather than get it from China and they,

737
00:45:30,350 --> 00:45:33,290
they have these bins and like
we had a problem with that,

738
00:45:33,291 --> 00:45:35,540
with the Alpha brain when we first had,
not steroids,

739
00:45:35,541 --> 00:45:39,050
but vitamins that were in Alpha brain
that weren't supposed to be there.

740
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:42,800
We have all our stuff independently
tested and when we had it independently

741
00:45:42,801 --> 00:45:43,580
tested,

742
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:46,430
it turns out that the mixers then when
they were putting all the different

743
00:45:46,431 --> 00:45:50,660
ingredients and they will be putting in
these vats and they had used these vats

744
00:45:50,661 --> 00:45:52,670
for other shit and had a
completely cleaned it out.

745
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:57,410
This is a problem with companies that
sell steroids and also sell things like

746
00:45:57,411 --> 00:46:01,940
creating like this is the,
this is the big story about John Jones.

747
00:46:01,941 --> 00:46:03,810
This is the big rumor.
This is what their,

748
00:46:03,811 --> 00:46:07,640
what they think is that he was doing
coke that had creatine in it. Yeah.

749
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:11,480
It was cut with creating that creatine
probably had trace elements of steroids.

750
00:46:11,510 --> 00:46:16,430
The reason why that makes sense is because
he tested negative right before that

751
00:46:16,431 --> 00:46:20,900
test and then tested positive and then
tested negative again a short time after

752
00:46:20,901 --> 00:46:24,740
that. This is a steroid that takes
several months to get out of your system,

753
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:28,790
but it got out of his system very quickly
which would indicate it was a very,

754
00:46:28,791 --> 00:46:30,680
very small trace amount.

755
00:46:30,950 --> 00:46:34,550
Not An amount that you would take if
you were actually using it to try to,

756
00:46:34,820 --> 00:46:38,780
you know, to get a performance
enhancing benefit. That's what I book.

757
00:46:38,820 --> 00:46:41,690
It makes sense to me. And so
it makes sense. Nitsky too.

758
00:46:42,110 --> 00:46:44,390
It's fair enough.
And I'm certainly,

759
00:46:44,391 --> 00:46:49,280
there's cases so under in my world where,
okay,

760
00:46:49,490 --> 00:46:51,830
first offense,
lifetime ban,

761
00:46:52,250 --> 00:46:55,190
I take a lot of guys would be a lot more
careful with things like app for one.

762
00:46:55,430 --> 00:46:58,910
And I think, uh, you know, there'll
be a due process. So, you know,

763
00:46:58,911 --> 00:47:01,570
say he proved that or like 10
meetings, you know, prove it right.

764
00:47:02,090 --> 00:47:03,930
He comes right back. Right. Um,

765
00:47:04,580 --> 00:47:09,580
and I also think unfortunately there
would be people that would probably,

766
00:47:09,970 --> 00:47:13,990
uh, you have no bad intention and
would, uh, have the, you know,

767
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:18,890
end up testing positive and having a
lifetime ban and there'll be martyrs.

768
00:47:18,891 --> 00:47:19,860
Basically.
I am,

769
00:47:20,450 --> 00:47:23,420
I can't sign off on martyrs,
man. 22 to have dreams

770
00:47:23,750 --> 00:47:25,220
for sure. For sure. What about you?

771
00:47:25,221 --> 00:47:28,580
Like what if you accidentally took some
creatine and bullshit and it personally,

772
00:47:28,581 --> 00:47:32,410
I'm uh, diligent. I do my,

773
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:34,940
I do my due diligence,
man.

774
00:47:35,170 --> 00:47:39,070
I worked with muscle farm for years now
and like I know that and they have great

775
00:47:39,071 --> 00:47:41,570
stuff. Yeah, they may have nice
stuff. I know that it's good stuff.

776
00:47:42,010 --> 00:47:46,960
That's my primary supplement
source. Um, I mean, I, I'm,

777
00:47:47,260 --> 00:47:49,090
I don't go do coke.
You know what I mean?

778
00:47:49,091 --> 00:47:53,770
Like if you do those things and something
bad happens to you, that's your fault.

779
00:47:53,890 --> 00:47:58,570
You know what I mean? If, if,
if for instance, he was doing
coke and, uh, he, you know,

780
00:47:58,571 --> 00:48:02,920
not knock on John Jones either. I mean,
I'm not living his life. I mean, it's,

781
00:48:02,921 --> 00:48:07,870
he's in a difficult situation
as a young kid, uh, you know,

782
00:48:07,871 --> 00:48:09,180
with God,
I mean,

783
00:48:09,550 --> 00:48:13,300
I can only imagine the amount of people
approaching him for crazy things and

784
00:48:13,301 --> 00:48:17,830
trying to talk him into all this. So I
have some sympathy for his situation. But,

785
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:20,830
you know, you make the choice, you have
to pay the consequences for the choice.

786
00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:25,440
I agreed that you should pay the con the
choice, the consequences for the choice.

787
00:48:25,441 --> 00:48:28,230
I just don't agree that the price
should be so high. You know,

788
00:48:28,231 --> 00:48:31,010
like when you think about
a guy like Anderson Silva,

789
00:48:31,050 --> 00:48:33,300
Anderson Silva just tested positive again.
Again.

790
00:48:33,301 --> 00:48:36,480
Do you think that that takes him out of
the consideration for the greatest of

791
00:48:36,481 --> 00:48:37,920
all time? In my mind, 100%.

792
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:42,690
See I'm doing it because he's old
and he's doing it because he said 40

793
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:46,390
so we again, we can feel whatever
you want to feel. Right. I mean,

794
00:48:46,391 --> 00:48:50,290
I feel like he probably wasn't doing it
the whole time, but he might've been.

795
00:48:50,890 --> 00:48:52,530
Yeah, but do I? No. Hell No.

796
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:56,170
You ever see his trainer?
Oh yeah. Yeah. I,

797
00:48:56,190 --> 00:49:00,100
Eric Silva when I fought him and you know,
it's trader looks ridiculous.

798
00:49:00,101 --> 00:49:04,890
He's set like 70 years old. He's
just flown. It looks like the hall.

799
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:09,710
He's got like 5% body fat at 60 years old.
Like I said,

800
00:49:09,711 --> 00:49:14,260
a picture of Daniel, the guy to Dana and
I go, this is Anderson's trainer, lol.

801
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:19,210
And Dana sends you back. Holy Shit.
Are you serious? Like, Oh yeah,

802
00:49:19,211 --> 00:49:22,540
that's his trainer. Oh
man, fucking guys. So Jack,

803
00:49:22,541 --> 00:49:25,570
Dana's certainly seen him around
you. You have lots of guys. Is that,

804
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:28,930
that's just not, and that's a
different guy, man. He's younger.

805
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:31,133
He's right.

806
00:49:34,030 --> 00:49:37,540
Book to the picture. To the left
is been left as the one. Yeah,

807
00:49:37,541 --> 00:49:38,410
that's the picture I said.

808
00:49:42,810 --> 00:49:46,600
I mean it's fucking abs
stick out like Blegh biceps.

809
00:49:47,170 --> 00:49:51,480
Each one of his abs looks like a, a
bodybuilder's Bicep, which is glued to it.

810
00:49:54,590 --> 00:49:56,210
That's great.
There's like,

811
00:49:56,950 --> 00:50:01,450
you can get big at 60 you could be pretty
built at 60 you can't be that built.

812
00:50:01,870 --> 00:50:05,740
It's not positive. It's like 0.01%
of the population that can do that.

813
00:50:05,741 --> 00:50:07,370
Maybe then they all live in Africa.
Yeah.

814
00:50:07,660 --> 00:50:10,020
They're out there all have
like super genes. You know,

815
00:50:10,150 --> 00:50:12,070
they're all like Francis and condos,
relatives.

816
00:50:13,830 --> 00:50:16,450
So few people that are built like that.
No,

817
00:50:17,830 --> 00:50:22,090
not at that age. You know, at that age,
you know, the body starts to diminish.

818
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:25,840
There's just no if, ands, or buts about
it. Do you know that he's at old for sure.

819
00:50:25,930 --> 00:50:29,690
Yeah. That guy's old. Yeah, he's in his
sixties yeah. That's funny. Yeah. He's a,

820
00:50:29,750 --> 00:50:33,100
I think he's an ex GM, right? Is,
is that it? How do you train jockey?

821
00:50:33,110 --> 00:50:34,960
I know he trained Eric Silva
who was at [inaudible].

822
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:38,510
He was in his corner and I was like, I'm
glad I'm fighting a little guy, not him.

823
00:50:39,010 --> 00:50:43,490
Nope. Change boy. You want to talk
about a post Usada guy? Like he's,

824
00:50:43,580 --> 00:50:45,930
he's one of him and Vito Vito,

825
00:50:45,940 --> 00:50:48,020
obviously it was a testosterone
replacement therapy,

826
00:50:48,021 --> 00:50:52,380
but I think Johnny Hendricks was
probably the most obvious. Right.

827
00:50:52,450 --> 00:50:55,670
Formance wise for sure.
You got to wonder about Hendrix,

828
00:50:55,671 --> 00:50:57,320
like how much of it was burnout,

829
00:50:57,350 --> 00:51:00,470
how much of it was possibly
he was taking something.

830
00:51:00,650 --> 00:51:03,920
You got to say it possibly because we
never tested positive for anything.

831
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:07,520
Absolutely. Yeah. But Dude, he
was launching people across.

832
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:11,320
I was the last fight before you saw
the, when I fought him, you know,

833
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:14,360
I felt a strength. I've
seen his body. I mean,

834
00:51:14,930 --> 00:51:19,200
I felt it firsthand is a completely
different world. Yeah. Yeah. Well,

835
00:51:19,270 --> 00:51:23,300
especially completely different compared
to now. He doesn't look the same.

836
00:51:23,690 --> 00:51:25,500
He doesn't fight the same.
It's like, it certainly part,

837
00:51:25,501 --> 00:51:29,130
part of that has to be motivation to,
I mean, he's just, there's no way he,

838
00:51:29,140 --> 00:51:33,830
he's under the same, uh, mental,
uh, aspiration that he had before.

839
00:51:33,860 --> 00:51:35,450
He's just,
he just looks at it differently.

840
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:39,330
It could be also because it's hormones
are all fucked up. Absolutely.

841
00:51:39,380 --> 00:51:44,000
A big speculation. If he was on something
and then he's off his hormones crash,

842
00:51:44,180 --> 00:51:47,240
there's no way they can't. That's just
hand that and that affects your mind.

843
00:51:47,241 --> 00:51:50,540
Right. 100% now that I
never take it, but I mean,

844
00:51:50,541 --> 00:51:55,541
I see people that go on and off of it
and they're like depressed and the tour,

845
00:51:56,150 --> 00:51:57,620
remember when [inaudible] came back,

846
00:51:57,621 --> 00:52:01,010
I mean there's so many pictures of
[inaudible] when he fought like Michael

847
00:52:01,010 --> 00:52:04,730
Bisping and then you see v
tour after Usada and he just,

848
00:52:04,790 --> 00:52:08,480
he's got that old man bod and he goes in
there and his body's kind of like loose

849
00:52:08,481 --> 00:52:11,900
and it just is, your body's
not producing hormones anymore.

850
00:52:12,770 --> 00:52:17,200
Details on that shit. When he was 19
man, well, yeah, I guess, yeah, yeah.

851
00:52:17,201 --> 00:52:21,980
One of the last few Randy and he was 240
pounds. And his neck started up here.

852
00:52:22,250 --> 00:52:26,060
His neck started about two inches above
his ears and just went down straight to

853
00:52:26,061 --> 00:52:30,050
his shoulder.
He's so fast.

854
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:33,500
It's like ridiculously fast. Yeah.
Especially when he fought tank.

855
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:37,130
Well five ridiculously fast.
Yeah.

856
00:52:37,131 --> 00:52:42,131
Cause I would have for is any like if you
slow down when you stopped taking that

857
00:52:42,711 --> 00:52:45,710
stuff, like if your muscles
actually uh, you know,

858
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:48,510
your fast twitch muscles go away
or something like that, you know,

859
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:50,270
the body crashes right?

860
00:52:50,330 --> 00:52:55,250
When you're that jacked up on steroids,
your whole body, first of all,

861
00:52:55,251 --> 00:52:58,700
your, your balls are just like on
vacation. I mean, I know you get stronger,

862
00:52:58,701 --> 00:53:01,100
but what about, you know, speed
though that's a different thing.

863
00:53:01,101 --> 00:53:05,750
I said a lot of speed is
from a, a neurological right
is a lot of uh, you know,

864
00:53:05,751 --> 00:53:09,220
the nervous system. So I wonder, you
know, about the effects on like, well,

865
00:53:09,221 --> 00:53:13,190
I don't know, did you see the study, uh,
Andy Gap and just came out with which one?

866
00:53:13,191 --> 00:53:17,060
He just posted it the other day about
a epigenetic memory of muscles. Yes.

867
00:53:17,061 --> 00:53:18,140
So this is I think,

868
00:53:18,141 --> 00:53:23,141
a big problem with the steroids because
I say I do steroids when I'm 19,

869
00:53:23,511 --> 00:53:26,250
now my muscles get jack to now my muscles.
Remember

870
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:28,670
how to get that jacked again.
Um,

871
00:53:28,870 --> 00:53:32,720
even though I'm off steroids for 10
years and then I come back at 30 and and

872
00:53:32,730 --> 00:53:36,690
Redo it. That's a very good point. That's
a very good point. And a very real point.

873
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:37,231
Yeah.

874
00:53:37,231 --> 00:53:41,100
You body has muscle memory and especially
if you do it when you're young and

875
00:53:41,101 --> 00:53:44,070
then your body has an adequate amount
of time to rebuild and you start

876
00:53:44,071 --> 00:53:48,350
developing a natural hormone level that
also increases your tendon strength. It,

877
00:53:48,510 --> 00:53:52,020
it increases ligaments, strength.
I mean it just, your body changes.

878
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:55,890
It changes the density of your
muscles, of your bones. It just does.

879
00:53:56,190 --> 00:53:57,690
There's a lot of bet.
I mean,

880
00:53:57,990 --> 00:54:02,070
and then there's another argument for
women and women that have taken steroids.

881
00:54:02,071 --> 00:54:05,310
It's even more intense argument because
you're putting supernatural levels of

882
00:54:05,311 --> 00:54:06,840
testosterone in a woman's body.

883
00:54:06,841 --> 00:54:10,620
They develop all this new muscle tissue
that never would have been there without

884
00:54:10,621 --> 00:54:14,190
it. And a certain amount of
that sticks around and you know,

885
00:54:14,191 --> 00:54:17,190
you might not even ever been able to
develop that kind of strength without it.

886
00:54:17,310 --> 00:54:19,590
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

887
00:54:19,591 --> 00:54:22,380
That's what that was the first thing I
thought of when I seen that study. Yeah.

888
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:25,500
And that was where I was,
I, you know, there's,

889
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:30,360
there's always a lot more to it
than meets the eye. Yeah. 100%.

890
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:32,670
Yeah. And you know, with uh,

891
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:36,240
the kind of cheating that they've
been doing in Russia, you know,

892
00:54:36,241 --> 00:54:41,110
did you see that movie Icarus? No,
it's on Netflix. Right? Yeah. Gotcha.

893
00:54:41,130 --> 00:54:44,250
Talking about what to say? It's fucking
crazy. I just watched so little TV,

894
00:54:44,251 --> 00:54:47,310
I just miss everything. Yeah.
Every, every day. Someone,

895
00:54:47,340 --> 00:54:51,360
did you see this on Netflix now? I
plan on it. It's on my cue. It'll make,

896
00:54:52,230 --> 00:54:55,380
it'll make you, it'll make you
curious and mad at the same time.

897
00:54:55,780 --> 00:54:58,710
Cause they had a state sponsored
state sponsored doping program.

898
00:54:58,740 --> 00:55:02,010
Russia had a June, right? Yeah.

899
00:55:02,011 --> 00:55:04,240
But this was proved the guy,

900
00:55:04,890 --> 00:55:08,820
the guy who was doing it as in this
documentary and he was helping this guy,

901
00:55:08,821 --> 00:55:11,250
Bryan Fogel,
do a bike race.

902
00:55:11,460 --> 00:55:15,360
What Bryan Fogel did was he did a bike
race with nothing and then he wanted to

903
00:55:15,361 --> 00:55:18,780
get juiced up and see what the
difference is, uh, with the next year,

904
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:21,330
do the same race,
but do it on everything.

905
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:26,220
And so he contacted this Russian guy who
was the head of anti-doping in Russia.

906
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:29,700
Well, this guy along the way
from doping up Bryan Fogel,

907
00:55:29,850 --> 00:55:32,460
they all got busted and
when they got busted,

908
00:55:32,461 --> 00:55:36,550
not Bryan Fogel does the
Olympics in, in Russia, the, um,

909
00:55:36,630 --> 00:55:38,220
they had the Sochi Olympics.

910
00:55:38,580 --> 00:55:42,990
They found out that people at Tam
tampered with samples and a bunch of shit

911
00:55:42,991 --> 00:55:46,080
started coming out about it.
And then it became this gigantic scandal.

912
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:47,460
He'd fled Russia,

913
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:51,540
came to the United States and testified
and told everything that he did.

914
00:55:51,780 --> 00:55:56,580
They opened up these supposedly on
openable sample jars and replace the bad

915
00:55:56,581 --> 00:55:58,110
urine with clean urine.

916
00:55:58,230 --> 00:56:01,920
They had frozen urine and then they had
a hole in the wall with their passing

917
00:56:01,921 --> 00:56:06,530
urine and replacing the old stuff.
Was this specific to a certain,

918
00:56:06,700 --> 00:56:09,930
a specific sports sports across the board.

919
00:56:10,050 --> 00:56:12,180
And they had a record number
of gold metals that year.

920
00:56:13,050 --> 00:56:16,980
Everybody's juice to the tits
and everybody's pissing clean.

921
00:56:17,010 --> 00:56:20,400
That's the tough thing about everybody
goes into the Russian training methods

922
00:56:20,401 --> 00:56:21,870
and how they're superior and everything.

923
00:56:21,871 --> 00:56:24,010
And you're like a little
bit of that little bit

924
00:56:24,010 --> 00:56:24,843
of this.

925
00:56:24,950 --> 00:56:27,740
There's some great Russian
training methods for sure.

926
00:56:27,741 --> 00:56:29,660
I mean the Russians
invented the kettle bells.

927
00:56:29,930 --> 00:56:34,930
Russians have a super technical wrestling
instruction and there's some without a

928
00:56:35,271 --> 00:56:37,310
doubt,
some great Russian training method.

929
00:56:37,311 --> 00:56:39,260
But it's also because
sports means so much.

930
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:44,070
So then they say like they were there also
state sponsored scientist rather than,

931
00:56:44,340 --> 00:56:47,850
you know, in America where it's, you
know, fear of professor or something.

932
00:56:47,851 --> 00:56:51,650
You just do what you want to do for your,
for your athletes or whatever.

933
00:56:51,860 --> 00:56:55,220
Well we have to realize that their
best athletes are all amateurs. Yeah.

934
00:56:55,500 --> 00:56:59,700
They don't have professional sports
boxing. Yeah. But that's it. I mean,

935
00:56:59,730 --> 00:57:03,210
and they don't have, well they have
MMA to fade or obviously right,

936
00:57:03,390 --> 00:57:07,410
but they don't have like NFL,
NBA,

937
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:11,520
Major League baseball hockey.
Right. They don't have like this.

938
00:57:11,521 --> 00:57:14,760
It's true professional
venue like we do over here.

939
00:57:14,761 --> 00:57:18,030
So a lot of their greatest
athletes go into amateur Olympics.

940
00:57:18,570 --> 00:57:21,660
And so their juice in these
fucking people up for Soviet glory,

941
00:57:21,661 --> 00:57:25,620
they're doing it for the glory of the
country and it's sponsored by the state.

942
00:57:25,621 --> 00:57:29,490
And they outline in this documentary
from Putin all the way down,

943
00:57:29,491 --> 00:57:30,960
people working for Putin,

944
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:34,800
who this guy is Gregory Guy who was the
guy who was in charge of all the state

945
00:57:34,801 --> 00:57:38,640
sponsored doping. It's fucking
madness and it makes you wonder,

946
00:57:39,150 --> 00:57:39,983
you know what I mean?

947
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:45,420
Nobody wants to say like Faye door
in pride was the motherfucker, right?

948
00:57:45,421 --> 00:57:49,290
I mean he was the love of fucker. I'd
love to an animal and it makes you wonder,

949
00:57:49,730 --> 00:57:52,170
it makes you wonder like
what was going on over there.

950
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:57,250
Loved it, man. Yeah, I was one of
the best, I think a cro cop, fader.

951
00:57:57,310 --> 00:58:00,170
Whew man.
That was like,

952
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:03,790
for me it was probably
like the most intense.

953
00:58:03,820 --> 00:58:08,320
I had to stay up for it and
I just remembered waiting,
watching them walk out,

954
00:58:08,321 --> 00:58:11,120
just eyes. Those are like, it's
three o'clock, right? Yeah.

955
00:58:11,130 --> 00:58:16,020
I remember it was really late at night.
Maybe it was snowing and shit. That's how,

956
00:58:16,190 --> 00:58:21,190
I don't know why I remember that, but I
was like, I'm not fucking going anywhere,

957
00:58:21,191 --> 00:58:25,270
man. I'm sitting here watching this.
The eyes bulging out just, you know,

958
00:58:25,300 --> 00:58:27,470
I didn't care man. Yeah. Feed versus,

959
00:58:27,490 --> 00:58:30,460
no guara it's so rare that
fights are like that anymore.

960
00:58:30,490 --> 00:58:34,810
I mean there's certainly some, yeah,
I come up here and there, but man,

961
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:39,670
those to me were the glory
days, man. Yeah. Cause well,

962
00:58:39,730 --> 00:58:44,650
we waited how long to see the fight? Yeah.
You know, it's like three, four months.

963
00:58:44,651 --> 00:58:46,440
There's no fights in between.
You know,

964
00:58:46,450 --> 00:58:49,330
there's like one UFC fighter or
something and we're just like, dude,

965
00:58:49,331 --> 00:58:50,111
this is the fight.

966
00:58:50,111 --> 00:58:52,900
This is the Superbowl that everybody's
been waiting the whole season four is too

967
00:58:52,901 --> 00:58:57,460
many fights now. I don't know. I
like it. There's a lot of fights,

968
00:58:57,730 --> 00:59:01,690
but I also think that some of them get
overlooked. Absolutely. Absolutely.

969
00:59:01,691 --> 00:59:06,160
And like I wish there's a side of me
that wishes it was the way it was back in

970
00:59:06,161 --> 00:59:08,200
the day. And there's a side
of me that's like, I do,

971
00:59:08,201 --> 00:59:10,330
this is what we all wanted
from the beginning. You know,

972
00:59:10,540 --> 00:59:14,020
we wanted fights every
weekend. But uh, I again,

973
00:59:14,021 --> 00:59:18,900
unfortunately it does take away
from that gigantic fight. You know,

974
00:59:18,910 --> 00:59:22,130
those are harder to make these days
and think that's why they're doing

975
00:59:22,130 --> 00:59:25,190
the champ versus champion. They're trying
to make those big fights again. Yeah,

976
00:59:25,191 --> 00:59:27,980
I think so too. But if you only have
those fights every three or four months,

977
00:59:27,981 --> 00:59:30,170
there's no way you're going to have
enough fights for all the athletes in the

978
00:59:30,171 --> 00:59:31,210
UFC.
Absolutely.

979
00:59:31,230 --> 00:59:35,930
That's a big part of the issues is 500
fighters on roster plus I think there's

980
00:59:35,931 --> 00:59:36,660
more now actually

981
00:59:36,660 --> 00:59:41,310
I, the only thing I, I, I mean I'm
the, I'm no one to say how to do it,

982
00:59:41,311 --> 00:59:44,070
but I kind of wished there was like a,
you know,

983
00:59:44,071 --> 00:59:47,130
the UFC fight night and then
the pay per view and you know,

984
00:59:47,131 --> 00:59:49,770
they have all these different
things but they don't seem to,

985
00:59:49,860 --> 00:59:52,960
I mean I think that may be moving towards
it where there's sort of a, you know,

986
00:59:52,961 --> 00:59:55,460
the smaller fights workup like you,

987
00:59:55,470 --> 00:59:58,380
you do like a UFC fight night three
or four times, build an audience.

988
00:59:58,410 --> 01:00:02,190
Now we put you on paper view for the
big fight. You get what I'm saying?

989
01:00:02,830 --> 01:00:03,790
Something like this,

990
01:00:03,791 --> 01:00:07,780
like not necessarily like a feeder
but you know within the organization.

991
01:00:07,781 --> 01:00:08,430
A feeder.

992
01:00:08,430 --> 01:00:11,670
Yeah, I know what you mean.
Yeah. Uh, yeah, more structured.

993
01:00:11,790 --> 01:00:14,640
I mean I love the big events
that they have every year,

994
01:00:14,641 --> 01:00:16,910
like the 4th of July event,
the new year's event,

995
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:20,810
the Madison Square Garden event they have
where they just stack it and just have

996
01:00:20,910 --> 01:00:24,240
just a ton of, of big
time fights. But you know,

997
01:00:24,241 --> 01:00:28,620
like I liked Eric Andrews Liotta Machida
last week too, you know, I mean I like,

998
01:00:28,680 --> 01:00:32,760
I like that too, where it's maybe a fight
that not a lot of people are watching,

999
01:00:32,761 --> 01:00:35,370
maybe less people are watching.
But it's an interesting fight still.

1000
01:00:36,030 --> 01:00:39,000
I didn't get to watch it.
I don't have cable anymore,

1001
01:00:39,020 --> 01:00:42,810
so don't donate to have cable.
Like we use Netflix. My wife does.

1002
01:00:43,140 --> 01:00:47,630
But do you have a, do you want to say
it? The UFC APP? I do have the UCF.

1003
01:00:47,670 --> 01:00:49,980
Was It on there? Yeah. Well it wasn't,

1004
01:00:49,981 --> 01:00:54,240
but it probably will be how long after
it will be and that's onto the wait

1005
01:00:54,241 --> 01:00:57,900
before from Fox sports one till
it's on the UFC. I don't even know.

1006
01:00:57,930 --> 01:01:00,510
I mean that's the thing though is
that I sit there and watch that.

1007
01:01:00,511 --> 01:01:03,840
If I'm watching anything,
it's always fights on there or youtube.

1008
01:01:03,841 --> 01:01:07,500
I just watch them. Boy Thai fights all
day. That's like my favorite thing. Yeah,

1009
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:10,530
just look Sanchez latest.
Uh, the question mark kick

1010
01:01:12,140 --> 01:01:16,590
where he got pulled up his shorts
right after he did it to this guy. Man.

1011
01:01:16,650 --> 01:01:19,320
I love him. Wild Man. I love him. Sanchez.

1012
01:01:19,321 --> 01:01:23,100
So interesting to me because
he's different than any
other Thai fighter in his

1013
01:01:23,101 --> 01:01:23,671
movements.

1014
01:01:23,671 --> 01:01:28,671
He so light on his feet and constantly
switching stances and he's just as a

1015
01:01:29,080 --> 01:01:30,570
Floyd Mayweather. More Thai. Yeah man.

1016
01:01:30,790 --> 01:01:33,780
Yeah, that's the guy I'm going to
try to get out here for, you know,

1017
01:01:33,790 --> 01:01:36,670
like what I'm doing with muscle farm
is some things I could try to help them

1018
01:01:36,671 --> 01:01:39,400
build a team and everything and he's one
of the guys I want to get out for our

1019
01:01:39,401 --> 01:01:40,580
seminar and kind of be,

1020
01:01:40,870 --> 01:01:44,960
you know, Philly's let me know and we'll
have, I want to meet that guy. Yeah.

1021
01:01:45,070 --> 01:01:50,030
Really want to get him cause
it's not just the, you know,

1022
01:01:50,050 --> 01:01:53,650
the way that he fights in the ring,
but the way that

1023
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:57,510
he trains man, he, I mean
he trains hard, hard,

1024
01:01:57,570 --> 01:02:01,490
you know you watch these videos up and
you're like dude, it is so easy for him.

1025
01:02:01,491 --> 01:02:03,010
That's the weird part, right.
They can be, he'll do it.

1026
01:02:03,020 --> 01:02:05,340
He'll do like 30 kicks in a row.
They do.

1027
01:02:05,370 --> 01:02:08,160
How did you just do that and
you're like smiling. Yeah.

1028
01:02:08,310 --> 01:02:11,310
Well he doesn't kick like he's loose.

1029
01:02:12,060 --> 01:02:14,180
He's not like a Liam Harrison.
Got It.

1030
01:02:15,460 --> 01:02:20,280
Yeah it is fucking 150% he's
like pop, pop, pop, pop,

1031
01:02:20,281 --> 01:02:23,130
pop, pop, pop, pop. And he just
keeps going. Just keeps going.

1032
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:26,970
I don't know if it's something you
can even trade. I mean, he's like the,

1033
01:02:27,300 --> 01:02:30,880
I'd say more like the Loma
Chico of Moitai, right.

1034
01:02:31,290 --> 01:02:34,320
His eyes and he just sees
that question mark kick.

1035
01:02:34,321 --> 01:02:38,960
I mean he just knows where he is and you
look at his body man, and he ain't done.

1036
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:43,950
It's scary. Impressive guy. Bull
cow, bull cows jacked, you know,

1037
01:02:43,951 --> 01:02:48,150
giant fucking ab muscles just ripped.
Sansai just looks like a guy.

1038
01:02:48,151 --> 01:02:51,750
Works out a little bit but me by,

1039
01:02:51,751 --> 01:02:56,160
he just fucks people up man. And
he's so slick with his move. I like,

1040
01:02:56,250 --> 01:02:59,310
even when he's hitting the pads who
hits pads like this where he's never,

1041
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:04,440
he never stops moving his feet so relaxed,
so relaxed and so fluid.

1042
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:08,550
What's interesting to me is the feet
just never stops moving his feet.

1043
01:03:08,551 --> 01:03:09,384
And that's just,

1044
01:03:09,420 --> 01:03:13,620
I don't understand why more people
don't emulate his style because he's

1045
01:03:13,770 --> 01:03:16,740
obviously a traditionally
trained tie fighter,

1046
01:03:16,830 --> 01:03:21,720
but as adapted everything to a
much more dynamic and fluid method.

1047
01:03:21,750 --> 01:03:25,860
Man, it's like you, you know, when
I watched Sam Chai and Loma check,

1048
01:03:25,870 --> 01:03:30,810
I'll watch the shit out of
these guys. Right? So I got
washed Liam Harrison, right?

1049
01:03:30,811 --> 01:03:34,520
Or John Wayne par. Uh,
Raymond deckers here,

1050
01:03:34,530 --> 01:03:37,750
these great more Thai guys. Right?
And they inspire me. I'm like, Jen,

1051
01:03:37,830 --> 01:03:41,550
I want to fuck it up. And then I'll
watch Sam Child Watch Loma Chicco my,

1052
01:03:41,580 --> 01:03:46,230
why do I do this? Right? It's
the next level I do. I show,

1053
01:03:46,231 --> 01:03:50,120
why am I even going to the gym? I can't
look at it. I can't do this flap flap Ma.

1054
01:03:50,210 --> 01:03:53,940
That's what I'm talking about right there.
And so fluid and just relax.

1055
01:03:54,660 --> 01:03:58,500
Look at him. He's getting tired. I mean,
look at his face. He doesn't even, I mean,

1056
01:03:59,430 --> 01:04:01,830
he could do this all day,

1057
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:05,910
a whole day and I mean he could do
it in his kitchen while he's cooking.

1058
01:04:05,911 --> 01:04:10,350
You know, it's 36. Yeah, I
mean it's really incredible.

1059
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:13,080
He's something special.
That's the most, uh,

1060
01:04:13,500 --> 01:04:16,020
most of the facial expression I've ever
seen. Hold, hold right there. Yeah,

1061
01:04:16,021 --> 01:04:20,220
it's probably been smiling 150
rounds at the end of the day. I mean,

1062
01:04:20,250 --> 01:04:22,410
guys constantly training,
constantly the gym.

1063
01:04:22,410 --> 01:04:26,490
And one of the things that I like about
the way the Thai spar too is that they

1064
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:29,100
play like they're tapping each other.

1065
01:04:29,270 --> 01:04:33,180
They're just working on their timing and
their movement and they're not hurting

1066
01:04:33,181 --> 01:04:37,320
each other. They're saving it for fights.
Yeah. Well they fight every week. Yeah.

1067
01:04:37,380 --> 01:04:41,160
My coach Dorean prices over there
and right now, man, they just,

1068
01:04:41,250 --> 01:04:45,980
they fight all every week. I
follow him on Instagram. Oh yeah.

1069
01:04:46,050 --> 01:04:49,640
He's a bad motherfucker. Amazing,
amazing person, man. Just, uh,

1070
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:51,780
one of the best guys you'll
ever meet in your life, man.

1071
01:04:52,020 --> 01:04:54,810
I like one of the things he said recently,
he's like, yeah, I'm wearing the same,

1072
01:04:54,811 --> 01:04:57,420
what a great t shirt and the same shorts.
He goes,

1073
01:04:57,421 --> 01:05:01,140
I'm going to here for a fucking fashion.
I'm here to train them in Thailand.

1074
01:05:01,210 --> 01:05:03,530
That's for you to get my work in.
Yeah.

1075
01:05:03,550 --> 01:05:06,120
And he goes over to Holland
with Ryan Simpson and

1076
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:09,930
another guy I hope to get over here too.

1077
01:05:09,990 --> 01:05:12,810
He was showing one of his
Instagram posts posts. He was like,

1078
01:05:12,811 --> 01:05:16,260
these are my five star accommodations.
He has white plastic bucket.

1079
01:05:16,410 --> 01:05:20,230
This is how I shower, you know, like
he's over there doing the real deal.

1080
01:05:20,650 --> 01:05:24,580
It'll tie fighter. Yup. Yup. So
that's where he actually goes up to.

1081
01:05:25,370 --> 01:05:27,460
Um, don't, I don't, I don't
think he's still goes up there.

1082
01:05:27,461 --> 01:05:30,940
But you used to go up to a song,
which is the northern part of Thailand.

1083
01:05:30,941 --> 01:05:32,980
And originally they didn't
let foreigners up there.

1084
01:05:32,981 --> 01:05:33,820
He would go to sit in and shy.

1085
01:05:33,821 --> 01:05:37,810
He was the first foreigner that they let
in that camp. And that was his dream.

1086
01:05:37,811 --> 01:05:41,500
He wanted to live like a tie fighter,
like a savage.

1087
01:05:41,501 --> 01:05:45,220
And that's where I'm lucky to have a
friend like him cause he brings the,

1088
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:49,630
the Thai style back to me. And that's
why I've never had to go to Thailand.

1089
01:05:49,630 --> 01:05:52,420
Like he goes over,
he will only come back for my camps.

1090
01:05:52,421 --> 01:05:55,780
He's had tons of people offer and
he won't come back for no one else.

1091
01:05:55,840 --> 01:05:57,770
That's awesome. It's been, uh, so when,

1092
01:05:57,771 --> 01:06:01,030
when I was telling you a story about
going know started his Japanese Jujitsu

1093
01:06:01,030 --> 01:06:01,960
Place,
the first gym I went into,

1094
01:06:01,961 --> 01:06:06,640
he was there and we both
started together and he wanted,

1095
01:06:06,641 --> 01:06:07,031
well he would,

1096
01:06:07,031 --> 01:06:11,140
he'd already started actually he was
out in Virginia and then just move to

1097
01:06:11,141 --> 01:06:15,610
Columbus. But he wanted, we both wanted
to do more tai and I was like, dude,

1098
01:06:15,611 --> 01:06:18,800
there's no money in what
time you do that shit. Uh,

1099
01:06:18,930 --> 01:06:22,570
so he went to my tie and I went with him
may of course he went with him may for

1100
01:06:22,571 --> 01:06:26,920
a little while. Did I wish there
was money in Moitai lion fight.

1101
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:30,760
I love watching it and I preferred
that even over regular kickboxing.

1102
01:06:30,760 --> 01:06:34,990
I liked that. Yeah. Yeah. Just why they
limit it. Yeah. Why limit it? I just,

1103
01:06:35,110 --> 01:06:38,170
I mean I think they limited it for k one
cause they thought it would create more

1104
01:06:38,171 --> 01:06:41,530
action with less clinching,
but it's garbage. It is right.

1105
01:06:41,531 --> 01:06:43,420
It's part of not garbage.
I shouldn't say that,

1106
01:06:43,421 --> 01:06:45,540
but still enjoy watching
belt or kickboxing.

1107
01:06:45,550 --> 01:06:48,130
I love Laurie cause they just
have some wild ass fights.

1108
01:06:48,131 --> 01:06:52,060
But a lot of those guys that are the top
of the food chain guys are Moyie Thai

1109
01:06:52,061 --> 01:06:55,960
guy. Yeah. I mean Kevin Ross is in Beltour
now. I mean this guy elbow, the shit.

1110
01:06:56,010 --> 01:06:59,620
Everybody, John and Joe Schilling.
Yeah. I mean these are elbow guys,

1111
01:06:59,890 --> 01:07:02,770
elbow guys and a man.

1112
01:07:03,160 --> 01:07:08,080
I've always thought that if a marketed
more tired, like they do the kickboxing,

1113
01:07:08,081 --> 01:07:09,610
I think it would blow up a lot better.

1114
01:07:09,640 --> 01:07:12,610
But when you take Moitai
like lion fights in the,

1115
01:07:12,790 --> 01:07:16,300
they're playing the snake charmer music
and they got the Mon kongs and they're

1116
01:07:16,301 --> 01:07:19,450
dancing around why crew in and
shit. And everybody's like, dude,

1117
01:07:19,451 --> 01:07:22,420
I don't want to see this garbage
will see some fucking blood. Yeah.

1118
01:07:22,421 --> 01:07:25,960
It's hard for people to appreciate the
tradition, but I don't, you know, I,

1119
01:07:25,961 --> 01:07:28,200
I respect the tradition. You
know, when someone explains to me,

1120
01:07:28,540 --> 01:07:31,440
they said that what's beautiful
about the Mong Kong and the,

1121
01:07:31,441 --> 01:07:33,940
the why crew is that you get relaxed.

1122
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:36,850
It's like you're out there dancing
and then you could put on your best

1123
01:07:36,851 --> 01:07:39,670
performance because you're already in
front of all those people and you kind of

1124
01:07:39,671 --> 01:07:43,750
loosen up. And then doing that. That's
one of the benefits of Hersa. I love it.

1125
01:07:43,751 --> 01:07:46,470
I think it's awesome and I'll
watch it all day long. Um,

1126
01:07:46,810 --> 01:07:50,320
but I don't think the casual American fan
is ever going to be attracted to that.

1127
01:07:50,590 --> 01:07:53,110
I wonder, you know, I wonder if
they could be talked into it.

1128
01:07:53,111 --> 01:07:57,070
It just seems like what happened with
MMA was like lightening in a bottle that

1129
01:07:57,071 --> 01:08:00,280
Forrest Griffin and Stephan
Bonner fight on TV on spike TV.

1130
01:08:00,281 --> 01:08:02,170
Nobody knew what the
fuck it was at the time.

1131
01:08:02,440 --> 01:08:05,290
You're watching MMA for the first time.
You see that crazy shit.

1132
01:08:05,291 --> 01:08:10,291
These guys just throwing down wild hay
makers and head kicks and takedowns and

1133
01:08:10,560 --> 01:08:14,470
Ah, and then exhausted. I mean these
guys just drain themselves out.

1134
01:08:14,620 --> 01:08:16,430
I think those guys made the UFC,

1135
01:08:16,430 --> 01:08:17,630
I think in that one fight.

1136
01:08:17,660 --> 01:08:21,020
It's one of those weird moments
lightening in a bottle. You know,

1137
01:08:21,021 --> 01:08:25,040
at one point in time they estimate
there was as many as 10 million people

1138
01:08:25,041 --> 01:08:29,510
watching that fight for. And it
started with just a couple of million.

1139
01:08:29,750 --> 01:08:33,680
Like the event started with just a couple
of Miami for gas. Is that watches too?

1140
01:08:33,750 --> 01:08:38,180
These guys are fucking going crazy.
And that one fight being so good,

1141
01:08:38,210 --> 01:08:42,950
I think made MMA, I think it just was
the launching point. And then after that,

1142
01:08:43,010 --> 01:08:46,520
people got into it and then they started
saying, Holy Shit, this is awesome.

1143
01:08:46,670 --> 01:08:50,600
And then all the other fights and then
it became the thing that it is today.

1144
01:08:50,601 --> 01:08:54,590
But I think that lightening in a
bottle moment, it's hard to recreate.

1145
01:08:54,591 --> 01:08:57,440
And with Moitai, it just
never happened. There's no,

1146
01:08:57,441 --> 01:08:58,970
there's no lightening in a bottle moment.

1147
01:08:58,971 --> 01:09:01,010
And I don't know how you
would recreate that today.

1148
01:09:01,370 --> 01:09:03,350
It seems like all the stars were aligned,
right?

1149
01:09:03,500 --> 01:09:07,130
Because now today reality
TV shows are kind of,

1150
01:09:07,460 --> 01:09:12,230
they're so saturated. There's so many
of them. Back then there wasn't as many.

1151
01:09:12,231 --> 01:09:13,760
So to have the ultimate fighter,

1152
01:09:13,940 --> 01:09:17,450
we got these guys in a house and they're
all competing and they're going to

1153
01:09:17,780 --> 01:09:21,530
fight for this six figure contract
on television. It was a big deal.

1154
01:09:21,710 --> 01:09:23,090
It was a big show to watch.

1155
01:09:23,360 --> 01:09:28,360
But now it's like everybody's watching
people fucking selling cars and pawn

1156
01:09:28,701 --> 01:09:32,420
shops and they're living in the woods and
people are making moonshine. It's like,

1157
01:09:32,421 --> 01:09:34,940
fuck man.
There's so many reality shows.

1158
01:09:34,941 --> 01:09:39,530
It's almost over saturated to the
point where if you had a Moitai show,

1159
01:09:39,650 --> 01:09:43,140
it's like, well, okay, here's another
crazy thing people are doing. Oh, this

1160
01:09:43,270 --> 01:09:46,510
Scott, the mood there, that more
Taika Tinder. That's right. They did.

1161
01:09:46,990 --> 01:09:50,650
Did that even air here? I wash
it. Did it air in America.

1162
01:09:50,680 --> 01:09:52,900
I don't know how I watched it.
Maybe on youtube or something,

1163
01:09:52,901 --> 01:09:55,790
but because the containment
was a boxing show, right? Yeah,

1164
01:09:55,810 --> 01:09:59,050
but they had the contender.
Was it good to call it the contender Asia?

1165
01:09:59,051 --> 01:10:00,280
Is that what it was called?
I don't remember.

1166
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:05,450
I remember John Wayne Power
was on at Yeltsin cli. That's,

1167
01:10:06,340 --> 01:10:09,760
I don't remember it. That's another bad
mother fucker. Yachts and Cli. Holy Shit.

1168
01:10:10,360 --> 01:10:13,340
He just came back. Did he? Oh, he
retired for a little bit, right?

1169
01:10:13,780 --> 01:10:17,630
I think last weekend maybe, man. Yeah.

1170
01:10:18,970 --> 01:10:23,920
To me it's one of the great unsung combat
sports and you know all these people

1171
01:10:23,921 --> 01:10:28,720
that are watching boxing and I
love boxing, but you know if HB oh,

1172
01:10:28,721 --> 01:10:33,430
just really wanted to get down and dirty.
Come on Hbo,

1173
01:10:33,460 --> 01:10:34,590
show me some Moitai.

1174
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:37,380
Absolutely.
That would be so amazing.

1175
01:10:37,530 --> 01:10:42,120
Have Sanchez ion or maybe
ESPN, you know, instead of,

1176
01:10:42,330 --> 01:10:46,020
instead of having these
commentators,

1177
01:10:46,021 --> 01:10:49,590
these narrators are just dip shits and,
and you know,

1178
01:10:49,591 --> 01:10:52,590
every time they talk about it in May,
I am most vomit.

1179
01:10:52,620 --> 01:10:56,910
I mean it's just ridiculous. And then, uh,
you know, instead of these garbage shows,

1180
01:10:56,911 --> 01:11:00,710
they have it. They have golf for, you
know, like, I mean some of the, uh,

1181
01:11:00,720 --> 01:11:04,530
they have like a darts,
darts on ESPN,

1182
01:11:04,890 --> 01:11:08,910
but you can't show a kickboxing match.
Come on. Well, you know what man? I think,

1183
01:11:08,910 --> 01:11:08,980
I think

1184
01:11:08,980 --> 01:11:13,380
there's a problem with commentary with
sports that leaks into MMA and I think it

1185
01:11:13,381 --> 01:11:17,020
belongs there. And I fought against it
from the beginning. And that's the, the,

1186
01:11:17,100 --> 01:11:18,660
the insult commentary.

1187
01:11:18,870 --> 01:11:22,480
There's a kind of like calling
people bums and calling people

1188
01:11:22,500 --> 01:11:26,520
losers and you know, and get
out, get out of the game.

1189
01:11:26,550 --> 01:11:29,910
Snoop Dogg that piece of shit. Do
you know what to call them out? What?

1190
01:11:29,970 --> 01:11:32,750
What's what, what don't you like
or what do you call a cutter?

1191
01:11:33,110 --> 01:11:37,230
Mary called him a bitch. That was a mess.
It was a man that's not cool either.

1192
01:11:37,290 --> 01:11:42,040
Fight. That was a mess. I think he was
fucked up. I don't care. Yeah. You know,

1193
01:11:42,110 --> 01:11:46,480
you'd be put it on public. He could
apologize, delete it, whatever, you know?

1194
01:11:46,750 --> 01:11:51,540
Yeah. If I go to the UFC,
Upi am I just punch him. If I
see him, I'm cool with that.

1195
01:11:51,930 --> 01:11:55,020
What else do you don't
want? None of that. Snoop,

1196
01:11:56,490 --> 01:12:00,540
I've just said, I really offends me,
man, because you know what, man? Connor,

1197
01:12:00,990 --> 01:12:02,910
you know people all have
their opinions about him.

1198
01:12:02,911 --> 01:12:05,820
I respect the shit out of that
guy. I love what he's done. I love,

1199
01:12:06,240 --> 01:12:10,470
I love his shtick. I think
he's a, he's a true, uh,

1200
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:13,290
sportsman. I mean, I liked him.

1201
01:12:13,320 --> 01:12:16,920
He comes into the limelight for a little
while and then he goes back and I think

1202
01:12:16,921 --> 01:12:21,450
he goes back and he works his ass off.
I really think he does. Definitely does.

1203
01:12:21,670 --> 01:12:25,120
I mean, he wouldn't be where he's
at if he didn't write, you know,

1204
01:12:25,140 --> 01:12:28,290
but everybody judges him by, you know,
what he, he does out here. But listen,

1205
01:12:28,291 --> 01:12:32,160
what he did was make $100 million
fighting against the greatest boxer of all

1206
01:12:32,161 --> 01:12:36,600
time for is did wash, no boxing match
ended well and won a couple of rounds,

1207
01:12:36,840 --> 01:12:41,280
which is fucking crazy. You know, that's
fucking crazy. I mean, I think Floyd,

1208
01:12:41,310 --> 01:12:44,620
I think, I think the vast
majority of people could, uh,

1209
01:12:44,630 --> 01:12:48,330
of good fighters could win around.
So you against Floyd because Floyd,

1210
01:12:49,950 --> 01:12:54,400
I don't know if I'd say gives them away,
but you know, he's going to feel you. He,

1211
01:12:54,420 --> 01:12:55,950
you know what I mean? He's,
that's the way he fights.

1212
01:12:55,951 --> 01:13:00,300
He's he fuck everybody liked that and
he rarely wins the first few rounds.

1213
01:13:01,470 --> 01:13:04,500
Agreed. Yeah, but that's not taken
away. Nothing from Connor though.

1214
01:13:04,501 --> 01:13:07,470
He didn't want to get clipped by
that left upper cut. I wasn't not,

1215
01:13:07,471 --> 01:13:09,440
it wasn't on his plans.
You're right. Yeah.

1216
01:13:09,900 --> 01:13:12,390
I just think the,
what I'm talking about,

1217
01:13:12,391 --> 01:13:15,900
it's like the commentators and a lot of
the journalists and you see less of it

1218
01:13:15,901 --> 01:13:19,650
today because I stayed at a
Smith. Yeah. That kind of style.

1219
01:13:19,770 --> 01:13:21,780
There's a style and this is their stick.

1220
01:13:21,810 --> 01:13:26,700
Their stick is mocking people
and creating controversy. And I,

1221
01:13:26,701 --> 01:13:29,640
that's why I say I don't
think MMA is a sport.

1222
01:13:29,700 --> 01:13:33,870
I think it's more intense that's you're
empty and out out there. You know when,

1223
01:13:33,890 --> 01:13:38,610
when you see a fight, you
know, and it's a crazy ass war,

1224
01:13:38,611 --> 01:13:43,611
like Robbie Lawler Hofeld dos Anjos where
it's just five rounds of chaos to to

1225
01:13:45,361 --> 01:13:48,300
diminish either one of
these guys as a man,

1226
01:13:48,330 --> 01:13:52,320
as a human being based on
their performance to mock
them or belittled them.

1227
01:13:52,710 --> 01:13:55,380
I just don't think it has any
place in that. I think it's,

1228
01:13:55,740 --> 01:14:00,740
it's a way more intense and way more
personal experience for those guys.

1229
01:14:02,520 --> 01:14:04,920
It's not, it's not playing
baseball. It's not,

1230
01:14:05,370 --> 01:14:09,510
it's not fucking bill Buckner dropping
a ball. It's not, that's not what it is,

1231
01:14:09,511 --> 01:14:13,230
man. It's way more intense. If you got
a guy who was a lazy football player,

1232
01:14:13,250 --> 01:14:16,510
doesn't run fast enough, you want
to mock them tasks, whatever,

1233
01:14:16,511 --> 01:14:19,180
you go ahead and do that. I
don't care. It doesn't bother me.

1234
01:14:19,480 --> 01:14:22,690
But you want to make fun of a guy who
was literally putting his health on the

1235
01:14:22,691 --> 01:14:23,860
line in a,

1236
01:14:23,861 --> 01:14:28,090
in an occupation where you're competing
against a mother fucking trained killer

1237
01:14:28,300 --> 01:14:31,390
and you guys are going to throw bones
at each other for five minute rounds.

1238
01:14:31,620 --> 01:14:33,010
You've got to have some respect.

1239
01:14:33,160 --> 01:14:35,380
You have to have respect or you
shouldn't be talking about it.

1240
01:14:35,650 --> 01:14:37,210
You should have some understanding of it.

1241
01:14:37,720 --> 01:14:41,110
You should know what the fuck you're
watching and you should have some respect.

1242
01:14:41,770 --> 01:14:43,690
And if you want to say
that a guy should retire,

1243
01:14:43,691 --> 01:14:46,900
that if you want to say that a guy has
probably seen as better days, that's fine,

1244
01:14:47,290 --> 01:14:51,460
but have some respect. Is, is a different
thing man. It is not a regular sport.

1245
01:14:51,560 --> 01:14:55,100
I agree. And I think I
would say also the, um,

1246
01:14:57,110 --> 01:15:00,720
they have no right to be saying things
that they've never done. Right. Yeah.

1247
01:15:00,830 --> 01:15:05,790
I mean you, you just can't, you
don't have to compete. Right?

1248
01:15:06,070 --> 01:15:08,060
Like you do Jujitsu and more time shit,

1249
01:15:08,061 --> 01:15:13,061
and you get such a more in depth
knowledge about what they're truly going

1250
01:15:13,671 --> 01:15:17,420
through and what's happening by just
experiencing it a little bit. Right.

1251
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:19,860
There's that.
And there's also,

1252
01:15:20,130 --> 01:15:24,390
I think if you've never really been
punched in the face and you're,

1253
01:15:24,420 --> 01:15:26,940
you're talking about guys
getting punched in the face,

1254
01:15:27,330 --> 01:15:30,150
like you really don't even
understand the experience

1255
01:15:30,510 --> 01:15:32,610
or if you never even worse.
I mean,

1256
01:15:32,611 --> 01:15:36,270
you've been never been punched in the
face and there's nothing you can do about

1257
01:15:36,271 --> 01:15:39,290
it. And I keep it, I mean,
the worst I've ever had a,

1258
01:15:39,291 --> 01:15:44,070
I went down to Cuba for a little while
and a train with the Olympic boxing team

1259
01:15:44,071 --> 01:15:48,810
down there, this, um, 2012 I then, yeah,

1260
01:15:48,840 --> 01:15:49,550
I think you're,

1261
01:15:49,550 --> 01:15:51,190
what was,
how did this come about?

1262
01:15:51,220 --> 01:15:53,140
Was that it was even legal
to go down there back then.

1263
01:15:53,370 --> 01:15:55,570
Did you go on a raft down there?

1264
01:15:55,980 --> 01:16:00,840
Um, I think I'm past the, uh, what
would they call it? Your limitations,

1265
01:16:00,841 --> 01:16:03,570
limitations. So it's actually
illegal to spend money there.

1266
01:16:03,571 --> 01:16:04,740
So I didn't spend any money there,

1267
01:16:05,130 --> 01:16:08,580
but I went there and I guess it's
not illegal to actually go there.

1268
01:16:08,581 --> 01:16:10,360
So we went through Mexico City.

1269
01:16:10,361 --> 01:16:14,260
He go to a mess you're stating and you
buy a flight in Mexico City. And My, uh,

1270
01:16:14,490 --> 01:16:18,720
one of my coaches I worked with for a
long time on and off as a Cuban and he

1271
01:16:18,721 --> 01:16:23,460
grew up there and he, we went there
together. He's a part of the, um,

1272
01:16:23,850 --> 01:16:25,320
he used to coach the wrestling team.

1273
01:16:25,321 --> 01:16:29,370
So I went there and train with
the wrestlers, uh, for six,

1274
01:16:29,371 --> 01:16:33,390
eight weeks and we'd go over to the
boxing team every now and then. Well,

1275
01:16:33,391 --> 01:16:36,900
I went with one guy, he was a
two time gold medalist, I think.

1276
01:16:37,560 --> 01:16:39,540
And I've never seen Boston.
I got my life. I mean,

1277
01:16:39,541 --> 01:16:43,370
I've never felt anything and there's
nothing I could do. Nothing. I mean,

1278
01:16:43,380 --> 01:16:48,090
I tried every fucking trick in the book.
I try every athletic move, I'd hands up,

1279
01:16:48,091 --> 01:16:52,990
hands down, here's the side, whatever.
Nothing. I mean, I've never seen Boston,

1280
01:16:53,670 --> 01:16:57,130
I mean two time gold medals. I mean,
he was an amazing, amazing boss.

1281
01:16:57,150 --> 01:16:59,320
I can't remember his name or anything,
but you know,

1282
01:16:59,350 --> 01:17:02,280
just never experienced anything like it.
And it was the same with the wrestlers.

1283
01:17:02,281 --> 01:17:05,810
I mean I went with,
uh, some guys that, um,

1284
01:17:06,360 --> 01:17:09,740
I've got to go with me hand Lopez,
his heavyweight of course, the Greco,

1285
01:17:09,741 --> 01:17:11,720
I don't know if you know,
he is greatest,

1286
01:17:11,721 --> 01:17:16,721
a Greco next to Carolyn rivaling
Carolyn and the greatest ever,

1287
01:17:17,870 --> 01:17:22,070
um, uh, you know, got this Guy Ivan Fund
door who you had been asking last week.

1288
01:17:22,071 --> 01:17:25,240
He was a guy who uh, I think, I
think he was the guy that asks me,

1289
01:17:25,250 --> 01:17:29,900
couldn't get past for the Olympics and
I know that a fund or beat him, but um,

1290
01:17:30,260 --> 01:17:34,580
he tacked him. So you know, as you
know, it amaze, as amazing as he is.

1291
01:17:34,581 --> 01:17:38,300
I mean that's how much better fun Doris
explain tectum for people. It's 15.

1292
01:17:38,301 --> 01:17:42,170
Was it 15 points? Um, I don't know
what it is in international actually.

1293
01:17:42,171 --> 01:17:45,440
I think it's, I thought it was
only like nine or 10, but whatever.

1294
01:17:46,020 --> 01:17:50,300
You got to get ahead of someone.
Yeah. I mean he worked him over.

1295
01:17:50,690 --> 01:17:55,430
Um, you know, so I got to work
with these, just a amazing guys.

1296
01:17:55,760 --> 01:17:58,490
But the boxing, you know, that's what
we were talking about. And I mean, I,

1297
01:17:58,510 --> 01:18:01,880
I've literally to,
to experience,

1298
01:18:01,881 --> 01:18:05,690
so like this guy is punching you and
there's nothing you can do. Nothing.

1299
01:18:06,020 --> 01:18:08,060
You don't have to.
We're in a little ring and I mean,

1300
01:18:08,061 --> 01:18:11,330
you don't have a choice so you can get
out of the ring or you can get punched

1301
01:18:11,750 --> 01:18:16,280
and that's your only choice. Just Kenton
boxed up, boxed up and I mean, and,

1302
01:18:16,281 --> 01:18:20,330
and he's moving, you know, like Sansai
relaxed and chilled and he's like,

1303
01:18:20,331 --> 01:18:22,750
what do you want? You know, you
go fucking do something, but what,

1304
01:18:23,620 --> 01:18:27,010
why you're not talking to me like that.
But they're doing it with his motions.

1305
01:18:27,350 --> 01:18:31,740
Yeah. Yeah. Terrible. But what an
amazing place of man. But you know,

1306
01:18:31,760 --> 01:18:36,290
I feel really bad for those
people. The wasn't experience, man.

1307
01:18:36,500 --> 01:18:38,870
Just a different world. You feel like
you're going back in the fifties.

1308
01:18:39,050 --> 01:18:41,390
What'd you eat over
there? How do you eat? Uh,

1309
01:18:41,391 --> 01:18:45,170
so we stayed with Ivan Fund door and his
wife would actually cooked for us every

1310
01:18:45,170 --> 01:18:49,770
day. Um, but there's restaurants and stuff
too. I mean it's like a dollar or two.

1311
01:18:50,060 --> 01:18:53,780
We went to this one place just about every
day there was a sort of a big bowl of

1312
01:18:53,781 --> 01:18:56,510
spaghetti,
like this big around and this bay,

1313
01:18:56,570 --> 01:19:00,320
just a gigantic bowl for like a dollar.
Wow. He had a chicken on top. They don't,

1314
01:19:00,350 --> 01:19:02,330
um,
they don't have really have red meat.

1315
01:19:02,360 --> 01:19:05,480
I guess it's only for the
wealthy are for the top people.

1316
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:08,560
I don't know if it's illegal or something,
but um,

1317
01:19:08,690 --> 01:19:12,710
but why to witness the Lavonne
Lopez who we stayed with originally,

1318
01:19:12,711 --> 01:19:17,180
so to witness the way they live is
really fascinating cause so in their

1319
01:19:17,181 --> 01:19:20,150
wrestling dorms they have a,
it's like six stories high.

1320
01:19:20,300 --> 01:19:24,380
We had to walk to the bottom to get a five
gallon bucket of water to take a bath.

1321
01:19:24,470 --> 01:19:27,230
They had no running water upstairs. Take
a bath. That's how you brush your teeth.

1322
01:19:27,231 --> 01:19:31,910
That's how you do everything. The guys
on the top floor or the first level,

1323
01:19:31,970 --> 01:19:36,220
first team, the varsity team, so to speak.
I, you know, the first level guys, um,

1324
01:19:36,530 --> 01:19:41,360
they get a four meals a day and they
get, uh, air conditioning in the room.

1325
01:19:41,510 --> 01:19:43,190
They guys right below on the second team,

1326
01:19:43,490 --> 01:19:46,160
they got three meals a day
and no air conditioning.

1327
01:19:46,640 --> 01:19:50,900
So these guys are literally fighting
for their food and for a, uh, you know,

1328
01:19:51,110 --> 01:19:54,080
for the next level. And I mean,
I've seen fights break out.

1329
01:19:54,081 --> 01:19:57,660
I seen guys trying to hurt each
other in the wrestling room. Um,

1330
01:19:58,070 --> 01:20:00,740
I mean it's fucking intense day in,
day out man.

1331
01:20:01,280 --> 01:20:04,260
They have some incredible genetics
over there too. That's credible.

1332
01:20:04,450 --> 01:20:06,290
You are going to grow like Yoel Romero.

1333
01:20:06,320 --> 01:20:08,850
That motherfucker looks like he
was made in the lab somewhere.

1334
01:20:09,270 --> 01:20:12,930
Like some scientists just spliced
together all the perfect attributes.

1335
01:20:13,060 --> 01:20:15,410
It just to be clear,
like don't quote me on that.

1336
01:20:15,411 --> 01:20:18,240
I guess kind of high her through
translation, you know what I mean?

1337
01:20:18,241 --> 01:20:21,360
So I maybe if I got something
the with some, you know,

1338
01:20:21,361 --> 01:20:25,080
a bunch of Cubans trying to beat me up
for getting it wrong or anything, but um,

1339
01:20:26,020 --> 01:20:28,440
well like I said, it's amazing
place man. And those guys are just,

1340
01:20:28,441 --> 01:20:31,530
they're fighting for their food
man. And I seen, I seen one kid,

1341
01:20:31,531 --> 01:20:33,990
he was the cousin of
Lavonne Lopez Lavonne's,

1342
01:20:34,010 --> 01:20:38,730
a bronze medalist and probably should
have been gold medalist. Um, you know,

1343
01:20:38,810 --> 01:20:39,643
I don't want to,

1344
01:20:40,140 --> 01:20:44,640
the Olympics have a lot of kind of
behind the scenes stuff that people don't

1345
01:20:44,641 --> 01:20:48,630
know about that I'm not sure if I'm
really at liberty to speak out about in

1346
01:20:48,631 --> 01:20:52,970
public, you know, cause it's
rumors, right? No, there's
facts. There's certainly fast.

1347
01:20:52,971 --> 01:20:55,380
When I said I don't, I'm not sure that
I can really talk about it public.

1348
01:20:55,381 --> 01:20:59,580
I wouldn't want to hurt any, uh, any
of those guys. But, um, you know,

1349
01:20:59,581 --> 01:21:01,950
his cousin came from a Pan Yard del Rio,

1350
01:21:01,980 --> 01:21:05,400
which we went out there one day
and that was, that is a good story.

1351
01:21:05,401 --> 01:21:06,600
So we got to the peanut every,

1352
01:21:06,601 --> 01:21:11,601
it's like two hours from Havana and we
took a donkey cart to a fucking farm in

1353
01:21:12,061 --> 01:21:16,980
the middle of nowhere. We'd go back,
uh, probably five, six acre farm.

1354
01:21:16,981 --> 01:21:18,660
We walked back through this horse field,

1355
01:21:18,661 --> 01:21:21,110
walking over shit and everything
and in air and say, uh,

1356
01:21:21,510 --> 01:21:24,170
I actually all his pictures that
is too is fascinating. And, uh,

1357
01:21:24,180 --> 01:21:26,550
there's a forest and as soon
as you walk through the forest,

1358
01:21:27,180 --> 01:21:30,420
now it's a casino in the middle of a
forest. So I guess all Shit's illegal.

1359
01:21:30,421 --> 01:21:34,200
There's cockfights chicken fights
in the fucking middle of the woods,

1360
01:21:34,680 --> 01:21:39,630
which is illegal in Cuba. So I got to do
illegal. Yeah. So I got to, uh, you know,

1361
01:21:39,990 --> 01:21:43,540
experience illegal chicken fights
in an illegal country. And,

1362
01:21:45,150 --> 01:21:47,850
but yeah, we took the, uh, the
donkey cart out there and you know,

1363
01:21:47,851 --> 01:21:50,400
we got stopped by the cops actually,
as I'm sitting there, like, you know,

1364
01:21:50,401 --> 01:21:55,080
this is about to be really bad.
So I'd already told my wife that.

1365
01:21:55,770 --> 01:21:59,070
But, uh, so anyway, so
we had Pinar del Rio,

1366
01:21:59,071 --> 01:22:02,460
that's where Lavonne's cousin lived
there. He actually saved his money, which,

1367
01:22:02,461 --> 01:22:05,220
I mean, I think they get, like,
everybody gets like the same amount,

1368
01:22:05,221 --> 01:22:09,870
like the doctor and the,
the chef or like the waiter,

1369
01:22:09,960 --> 01:22:13,140
waiter or whatever they are, they
all get the same money. Right. Um,

1370
01:22:13,360 --> 01:22:17,610
I think it's 30 bucks a month. So he
saved all of his money, their entire home,

1371
01:22:17,611 --> 01:22:21,330
smaller than this room right here.
Uh, for people living in there.

1372
01:22:22,440 --> 01:22:27,180
Probably I would say about the size of
these tables combined. Wow. Um, anyway,

1373
01:22:27,181 --> 01:22:31,860
so I was trying to get his cousin saved
his money for like a whole year just so

1374
01:22:31,861 --> 01:22:34,950
he could come train with the
national team. He came out there, um,

1375
01:22:35,040 --> 01:22:39,580
didn't only had money to get there,
so lavonne was sharing his meals with him.

1376
01:22:39,581 --> 01:22:44,520
And um, so now he's only eating two
meals a day instead of the three or four,

1377
01:22:44,910 --> 01:22:48,360
maybe three meals out of the four,
something like that. But yeah, very,

1378
01:22:48,361 --> 01:22:49,950
very fascinating. Just
watching that, you know,

1379
01:22:49,951 --> 01:22:54,210
you would just forget what we have and
how blessed our lives are. And humbling,

1380
01:22:54,450 --> 01:22:58,440
humbling man. I mean, these and these
guys are just savages, men, uh, uh,

1381
01:22:59,040 --> 01:23:03,980
just hard, hard workers and getting the
job done, just getting nothing for it. Um,

1382
01:23:04,740 --> 01:23:08,490
you know, some of the guys at the
top, like Meaghan Lopez, he gets, uh,

1383
01:23:08,500 --> 01:23:13,350
some things like fun Dora for instance,
he got Internet access like that.

1384
01:23:13,470 --> 01:23:14,303
That was like a,

1385
01:23:14,320 --> 01:23:19,320
a blessing for him to have Internet
access because he had done so much for the

1386
01:23:19,811 --> 01:23:23,290
country in the Olympics. That's crazy.
I think he was a bronze medalist.

1387
01:23:23,291 --> 01:23:24,760
I think they hooked him
up with the Internet.

1388
01:23:24,790 --> 01:23:27,280
You get hooked up with Internet and
I still email him every now and then.

1389
01:23:27,281 --> 01:23:30,460
Like he'll send me pictures as a
family and stuff and, and you can,

1390
01:23:30,530 --> 01:23:32,710
and it at something like a,
you know,

1391
01:23:32,711 --> 01:23:36,520
fun dora@cubagovernment.net or something
like that. You know, maybe it's like a,

1392
01:23:36,521 --> 01:23:37,600
so it goes through the government,

1393
01:23:37,601 --> 01:23:41,950
so the government tracks every
email coming in and out. So yeah.

1394
01:23:42,340 --> 01:23:44,950
So he would even tell me like,
before I left, you know, like, like,

1395
01:23:44,951 --> 01:23:46,340
don't email me this or this,

1396
01:23:46,341 --> 01:23:50,620
then don't talk about this and why I
think it's maybe laxed up a little bit,

1397
01:23:50,621 --> 01:23:55,320
but I'm not sure man. So yeah, I can
tell you a lot of stories about it.

1398
01:23:55,330 --> 01:23:58,490
It was really a very
eyeopening experience. Like,

1399
01:23:59,230 --> 01:24:02,460
like I want to take my kids there
sometime. Like just to see the look.

1400
01:24:03,220 --> 01:24:06,670
You want to fucking, what if you grew up
here motherfucker, you know shit. Right.

1401
01:24:06,671 --> 01:24:11,440
You know, be happy. You know, you got what
you got and yeah, yeah. I mean as kids.

1402
01:24:11,441 --> 01:24:16,030
So one of the pictures I could show you
a be the wrestling where whom in Pinar

1403
01:24:16,030 --> 01:24:17,530
del Rio, I think he, Oh
Ramiro came from there,

1404
01:24:17,531 --> 01:24:22,531
actually may hand came from there and
Lavonne came from there and they're

1405
01:24:22,601 --> 01:24:25,900
wrestling room is actually probably
about as big as this room and it's a dirt

1406
01:24:25,901 --> 01:24:29,470
floor with the mats are, you know, so,

1407
01:24:29,670 --> 01:24:33,490
so if you imagine a Matt getting a
dissolved in water and like all the little

1408
01:24:33,491 --> 01:24:37,870
pieces just spread out.
So they sweep up all those pieces,

1409
01:24:38,140 --> 01:24:39,400
put them in a a,

1410
01:24:39,460 --> 01:24:42,430
it's about as big as this table here
that they sweep it all together and stack

1411
01:24:42,431 --> 01:24:45,160
it up and that's our mat. So
they just practice, you know,

1412
01:24:45,161 --> 01:24:46,150
basically take down stuff.

1413
01:24:46,151 --> 01:24:50,530
And that's why they're so hard to take
down that they learned from a young age.

1414
01:24:50,531 --> 01:24:54,550
And you get taken down and fucking sucks.
Wow. Actually a picture of it. I mean,

1415
01:24:54,551 --> 01:24:58,660
it's really fascinating. Wow.
How long were you over there for?

1416
01:24:58,850 --> 01:25:02,350
A six to eight weeks. I can't remember.
Something like that. That's a long time.

1417
01:25:02,410 --> 01:25:06,010
Yeah. We stayed for a long time and we
did basically the whole training camp over

1418
01:25:06,011 --> 01:25:10,400
there for which fight, uh, Jordan
mean. Wow. And that was, um,

1419
01:25:10,780 --> 01:25:13,090
so that's when I first started
working with our guide and you know,

1420
01:25:13,091 --> 01:25:15,070
the first thing he said was like,
you need better wrestling.

1421
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:19,480
It's good to keep it holy shit.
I said, all right, let's go. Wow.

1422
01:25:19,490 --> 01:25:23,950
As I wrestled with those guys every day,
um, my wrestling came up tremendously.

1423
01:25:24,250 --> 01:25:28,630
Oh yeah. I mean, there's no way
sink or swim. Um, and then I said,

1424
01:25:28,631 --> 01:25:31,270
I've got to work with the boxing
team and the Boston team. I mean,

1425
01:25:31,720 --> 01:25:35,620
the wrestling is one thing, but, uh, I
seen a lot of the junior boxing team guys,

1426
01:25:35,621 --> 01:25:39,460
I see one kid get kicked off the boxing
team. Like they take their boxing very,

1427
01:25:39,970 --> 01:25:43,310
very serious over there. Right.
That's our national sport. Uh,

1428
01:25:43,320 --> 01:25:47,140
one kid got kicked off the team because
he wasn't keeping up and they were doing,

1429
01:25:47,890 --> 01:25:51,130
they had to get up at like 5:00 AM to
like an eight mile run or something.

1430
01:25:51,131 --> 01:25:51,851
And they put,
you know,

1431
01:25:51,851 --> 01:25:55,060
water bottles like this and they fill it
up with sand and that's their dumbbells.

1432
01:25:55,480 --> 01:25:58,360
And the kid didn't have any shoes but
he couldn't keep up and they were doing

1433
01:25:58,361 --> 01:26:01,750
hill sprints and he kept falling behind.
They're like, you're off the team. Wow.

1434
01:26:01,900 --> 01:26:05,870
So they would do like a am and then
they go to school and then they do an

1435
01:26:05,900 --> 01:26:08,720
afternoon workout and then they go back
to school and then they do an evening

1436
01:26:08,721 --> 01:26:12,140
workout. And I live in these dorms
and that's literally all they do.

1437
01:26:12,460 --> 01:26:13,670
That's their entire life.

1438
01:26:15,170 --> 01:26:18,140
They want to get out there or
live a better life, you know,

1439
01:26:18,141 --> 01:26:23,060
the be a champion or die. Holy
Shit. Yeah. And uh, again,

1440
01:26:23,061 --> 01:26:27,930
you know, um, I, I was looking all this
or are learning all this too translation.

1441
01:26:27,931 --> 01:26:32,930
So, uh, you know, I could have
some things not exactly right, but,

1442
01:26:32,931 --> 01:26:35,300
you know, I was, I was living
there with them for a little while.

1443
01:26:35,301 --> 01:26:39,490
Have you wanted to go to
Thailand? Absolutely. Yeah.
Yeah, I do too. Yeah. You know,

1444
01:26:39,560 --> 01:26:41,510
my thing is, uh, so like when I did that,

1445
01:26:41,511 --> 01:26:45,230
my kids were very young and it wasn't so
bad to leave them with their mom for a

1446
01:26:45,231 --> 01:26:47,990
little while. Now I have a, you
know, now I have three kids,

1447
01:26:48,230 --> 01:26:51,480
specifically my daughter. It's
just hard to leave and, and uh,

1448
01:26:51,530 --> 01:26:55,160
to fly to Thailand if you'd
ever been there. No, no. I
say to fly there, you know,

1449
01:26:55,161 --> 01:26:59,120
is expensive and um, you
know, I don't want to leave.

1450
01:26:59,210 --> 01:27:01,030
I just can't leave my family and,
but this place is,

1451
01:27:01,031 --> 01:27:05,390
you can go and bring them like cat
supposed to be nice. Right. And it's,

1452
01:27:05,750 --> 01:27:08,600
yeah. And getting the flights, you know,
is what's expensive. Once you get there,

1453
01:27:08,710 --> 01:27:12,430
it's cheap. Right. But the flight,
I mean, $1,000 per person, you know,

1454
01:27:12,440 --> 01:27:16,610
I'm looking at $5,000 just to
fly there. So, yeah, I want to,

1455
01:27:16,611 --> 01:27:20,350
but that's my, the nice thing about
having [inaudible]. Yeah. Right.

1456
01:27:20,830 --> 01:27:25,100
Right now you live in, in Colorado
still or are you here? Yeah,

1457
01:27:25,101 --> 01:27:27,950
so I live in Colorado right now and
then I'm coming back and forth a lot.

1458
01:27:27,951 --> 01:27:28,960
Come too late.
Yeah.

1459
01:27:28,970 --> 01:27:32,210
Doing a lot of work with the MusclePharm
cause mussel farms opening up their

1460
01:27:32,270 --> 01:27:34,820
main headquarters now in Burbank.
Is that what's going to be,

1461
01:27:35,120 --> 01:27:37,460
so they moved here to move here?
Um,

1462
01:27:37,760 --> 01:27:40,680
well the CEO lives here for
one thing and I think a,

1463
01:27:40,681 --> 01:27:43,600
they're going to attract a
lot more athletes here and
I think that they're going

1464
01:27:43,601 --> 01:27:45,770
to be able to do a much bigger thing.

1465
01:27:45,771 --> 01:27:48,530
And really what they're doing is they're
restructuring the entire business.

1466
01:27:48,890 --> 01:27:53,810
They're kind of moving away
from just simply being a, um,

1467
01:27:54,320 --> 01:27:57,890
you know, whether the change like
from muscle farm to NP for instance,

1468
01:27:57,891 --> 01:28:02,870
so that it's not just for the
body builder type crowd and the,

1469
01:28:03,660 --> 01:28:08,240
excuse me, the for the meat heads and
the, you know, and without, you know,

1470
01:28:08,241 --> 01:28:10,580
I mean it was certainly still
be catering to the crowd,

1471
01:28:10,581 --> 01:28:15,410
but now they want to open it up more
as a lifestyle brand, expand it,

1472
01:28:15,411 --> 01:28:18,620
and there'll be doing a lot more
stuff with a lot more athletes,

1473
01:28:18,621 --> 01:28:22,490
which I think there'll be able to do out
here better than in Denver. What now,

1474
01:28:22,550 --> 01:28:26,990
as a guy who's trained at sea level
and you lived in Denver, um, what,

1475
01:28:27,050 --> 01:28:31,310
how much of a benefit is it to be at
that 5,000, 500 feet? Pros and cons?

1476
01:28:31,460 --> 01:28:33,560
What's the con?
Well,

1477
01:28:34,190 --> 01:28:38,840
the number one con is that you can't,
uh, your Max capacity is lower.

1478
01:28:38,930 --> 01:28:43,640
So you can't work as hard. He can't work
as hard. But now you get adapted though.

1479
01:28:44,060 --> 01:28:44,893
You know,
I've,

1480
01:28:44,900 --> 01:28:48,320
I've been a little tour with that because
I tell you when I do my mass capacity

1481
01:28:48,321 --> 01:28:49,320
training,
um,

1482
01:28:49,380 --> 01:28:53,030
I don't think I've been able to reach
the same levels that I wasn't sea level.

1483
01:28:53,270 --> 01:28:56,250
Um, I've heard other people
say that they are able to, um,

1484
01:28:56,330 --> 01:29:00,470
my prs in terms of lifts
have been comparable.

1485
01:29:00,870 --> 01:29:01,980
Um,
but of course I

1486
01:29:01,980 --> 01:29:05,730
was at west side before, so it's not
right. You know, I mean, you're just not,

1487
01:29:06,210 --> 01:29:10,620
I tell you what, you walk into west side,
like you hit a PR period. Like you don't,

1488
01:29:10,800 --> 01:29:14,130
it doesn't matter. There's an
energy in there. There's an aura.

1489
01:29:14,280 --> 01:29:18,240
It's an intense place. Yeah, you've been
there. I mean, you probably hit a PR,

1490
01:29:18,241 --> 01:29:22,910
but if you work out, um, I get nervous.

1491
01:29:22,930 --> 01:29:23,491
But I suppose it,

1492
01:29:23,491 --> 01:29:26,790
cause I mean the obvious pro is a red
blood cell count and I think your lung

1493
01:29:26,791 --> 01:29:28,750
capacity goes up.
Um,

1494
01:29:29,100 --> 01:29:32,670
the idea they say is to sleep at altitude,

1495
01:29:32,671 --> 01:29:34,640
but to train example.
Exactly.

1496
01:29:34,641 --> 01:29:39,120
And it's so that you can push your Max
capacity at sea level and then recover.

1497
01:29:39,440 --> 01:29:42,900
So if like if you're in California,
you would live in big bear,

1498
01:29:43,080 --> 01:29:46,410
but then you would train
down in San Bernardino or
something like that. Exactly.

1499
01:29:46,420 --> 01:29:50,550
Yeah. And I don't know. I don't even
know California well enough to know that,

1500
01:29:50,580 --> 01:29:52,290
how that works.
But it's pretty close.

1501
01:29:52,291 --> 01:29:55,020
You get to here in two hours
you could drive there. Right.

1502
01:29:55,021 --> 01:29:59,370
It's funny that people out here say
that's close, like to meet two hours,

1503
01:29:59,371 --> 01:30:02,700
a long ass way. Well, yeah.
No, it's close as fuck here.

1504
01:30:02,701 --> 01:30:05,130
Two hours to take you that long
to get to Irvine and traffic.

1505
01:30:05,490 --> 01:30:08,010
That's what everybody says.
That's how I got to work in Irvine.

1506
01:30:08,011 --> 01:30:10,410
Like if I'm doing the Improv
and it's an eight o'clock show,

1507
01:30:10,411 --> 01:30:12,870
I leave here at four not bullshit.

1508
01:30:13,320 --> 01:30:16,290
I leave here at 4:00 PM and I'm stuck
in traffic for two and a half fucking

1509
01:30:16,291 --> 01:30:19,570
hours. No bullshit that
everybody listens to. Podcasts,

1510
01:30:20,550 --> 01:30:24,720
podcasts, audio books, you
know, anything, anything.

1511
01:30:24,721 --> 01:30:28,530
Just keep your mind off that fucking
those red lights in front of me. Right?

1512
01:30:28,890 --> 01:30:33,810
I'm from Columbus, Ohio. Like you can go
around the outer belt in like an hour.

1513
01:30:33,840 --> 01:30:37,020
Yeah. Yeah. You guys have
terrible traffic. It's like, Yo,

1514
01:30:37,021 --> 01:30:40,640
I was stuck in traffic for 10 minutes.
Yeah, that's exactly. Yeah. Well, yeah,

1515
01:30:40,710 --> 01:30:44,730
I mean diverse. Pretty bad now actually.
All that weed. Yeah. All the weed, man.

1516
01:30:44,731 --> 01:30:48,390
People just, everybody just went there.
Yeah. Last time I was there I was like,

1517
01:30:48,391 --> 01:30:52,560
what the fuck is going on here with all
this traffic? It's just wheat apparently.

1518
01:30:53,150 --> 01:30:55,770
I guess it's actually been
growing for years, like any way,

1519
01:30:55,771 --> 01:30:58,500
but the men when you go ski
and that's the worst man.

1520
01:30:58,501 --> 01:31:02,100
You come back from a ski resort
Sunday four or five o'clock dude,

1521
01:31:02,101 --> 01:31:06,720
it's like I just did the other week and
it took me three and a half hours for a

1522
01:31:06,721 --> 01:31:10,650
one and a half hour drive. That's
crazy. Yeah. Well Denver is just,

1523
01:31:10,920 --> 01:31:12,570
it's an amazing city because you're in,

1524
01:31:12,660 --> 01:31:16,380
you're in this cool city
that's a real city, legit city,

1525
01:31:16,381 --> 01:31:20,070
and then right outside is the fucking
rocky mountains. It's right there.

1526
01:31:20,100 --> 01:31:23,340
Right there. You drive an hour
and you're in the rocky mountains.

1527
01:31:23,400 --> 01:31:26,520
I mean fucking wilderness.
Jack Elk,

1528
01:31:26,521 --> 01:31:29,880
Screamin and bears running around.
Wow.

1529
01:31:30,030 --> 01:31:32,820
I said the city has that
an hour outside the city.

1530
01:31:32,910 --> 01:31:36,630
You were in the fucking mountains. It is
sunny too. Yeah. You get all four seasons,

1531
01:31:36,631 --> 01:31:39,780
which I like, and the people are
cool as fuck. Yeah. People go, yeah.

1532
01:31:39,870 --> 01:31:42,390
This is one of the few places I
would live outside of California,

1533
01:31:42,420 --> 01:31:44,520
but I used to live era. Yeah,
I lived in boulder. Yeah.

1534
01:31:45,570 --> 01:31:48,270
I'm not sure I would go bolder, but while
I was in the mountains above boulder,

1535
01:31:48,820 --> 01:31:52,470
that was like 3000 feet above boulder,
I was an 8,500 feet.

1536
01:31:52,580 --> 01:31:56,460
It was pretty interesting. And as you feel
a difference, man, going up the stairs,

1537
01:31:57,250 --> 01:32:00,040
it's crazy. But did you adapt to
it and fell? The difference was

1538
01:32:00,040 --> 01:32:02,620
only there for three months.
My wife got, yeah, yeah.

1539
01:32:02,710 --> 01:32:05,710
My wife got pregnant and it's
rough up there for women.

1540
01:32:05,950 --> 01:32:09,280
If they haven't adapted,
it's rough in Denver,

1541
01:32:09,400 --> 01:32:12,260
but then you go 3000 feet across
Denver. It's real rough. Yeah.

1542
01:32:12,270 --> 01:32:15,700
I go up there all the time.
Yeah. If you're a woman and
you get pregnant up there,

1543
01:32:15,701 --> 01:32:17,980
it's like having the flu.
It's real bad.

1544
01:32:17,981 --> 01:32:22,150
And they have a really high instance of
low birth weight and premature birth.

1545
01:32:22,450 --> 01:32:25,300
I did not know that.
Yeah, Denver does as well.

1546
01:32:25,360 --> 01:32:28,510
Denver has one of the highest rates
in the country of premature births.

1547
01:32:28,570 --> 01:32:31,120
I did not know that. That's
fascinating. Yeah. Yeah.

1548
01:32:31,121 --> 01:32:34,480
I was up at my friend's house out by
Edward School a little bit past veil,

1549
01:32:34,490 --> 01:32:39,340
their day and like you were talking about
the elk and bears and stuff. I mean,

1550
01:32:39,520 --> 01:32:41,080
at nighttime he said,

1551
01:32:41,081 --> 01:32:43,930
usually you shine a flashlight out and
you just see the eyes of the mountain

1552
01:32:43,931 --> 01:32:47,680
lions. He's got dogs and stuff and
they're just sitting there waiting.

1553
01:32:47,950 --> 01:32:52,870
He's got a fence now, but he's like,
you just see their eyes. There was one,

1554
01:32:52,871 --> 01:32:57,190
a store that I tweeted out
today in California where
some fucking mountain line

1555
01:32:57,191 --> 01:33:02,080
was banging on this screen door or this
a glass door trying to get at this dog

1556
01:33:02,290 --> 01:33:04,960
in California. Yeah, they
got pictures of this cat.

1557
01:33:04,990 --> 01:33:09,670
You don't want to mess with those guys.
Yeah. One of them ain't my dog. A bears.

1558
01:33:09,671 --> 01:33:12,400
One thing I'll really, yeah,
one of meet my dog in Gold Hill.

1559
01:33:14,410 --> 01:33:16,030
This fucking mountain lion.
Man,

1560
01:33:16,720 --> 01:33:20,700
right outside these people's house
trying to get at that little dog. Yeah,

1561
01:33:20,710 --> 01:33:23,370
they took pictures of it that,

1562
01:33:23,380 --> 01:33:25,180
and it's killed a bunch of
pets in the neighborhood.

1563
01:33:25,181 --> 01:33:28,120
Apparently they have a real problem with
them in California because they don't

1564
01:33:28,121 --> 01:33:31,060
hunt them. So they're not
scared of people at all. And,

1565
01:33:31,061 --> 01:33:36,061
and that's a problem with California
right there against everything that I'm

1566
01:33:36,071 --> 01:33:39,820
for.
They're against legalizing weed.

1567
01:33:40,570 --> 01:33:41,950
It's ignorant based.

1568
01:33:41,980 --> 01:33:46,980
They have an idea of what a mountain
lion is and that these are these majestic

1569
01:33:46,991 --> 01:33:48,220
creatures and they shouldn't be hunted.

1570
01:33:48,221 --> 01:33:51,220
And what they would like to
do is eliminate all hunting
and let nature sorted

1571
01:33:51,221 --> 01:33:52,054
out on their own.

1572
01:33:52,060 --> 01:33:55,480
But yet they have grocery
stores everywhere where they
have food that's murdered

1573
01:33:55,481 --> 01:33:58,240
animals that are factory farm. It's
the stupid, it's fucking shit ever.

1574
01:33:58,510 --> 01:34:00,580
You're not going to turn the
whole state and to vegetarians.

1575
01:34:00,850 --> 01:34:01,960
So this idea that you're not,

1576
01:34:01,990 --> 01:34:04,780
you're going to eliminate
hunting is so fucking stupid.

1577
01:34:04,781 --> 01:34:06,540
It's like you would rather
people try and do that,

1578
01:34:06,560 --> 01:34:11,470
try to eliminate hunting or the people
that are the most radical wildlife

1579
01:34:11,530 --> 01:34:16,480
activists would like to
eventually eliminate hunting
and have all these animals

1580
01:34:16,481 --> 01:34:18,550
sorted out with themselves
in a natural way,

1581
01:34:18,551 --> 01:34:20,620
but they're never going to
eliminate people eating meat.

1582
01:34:20,650 --> 01:34:24,250
97% of the people in this country eat
meat that, so that's a real number.

1583
01:34:24,400 --> 01:34:29,080
So this idea that you're going to somehow
or another change those 97% based on

1584
01:34:29,081 --> 01:34:32,620
the desires of the 3% which
fluctuate back and forth. By the way,

1585
01:34:32,980 --> 01:34:36,220
the 3% there's a lot of those 3%
that fall off and they eventually,

1586
01:34:36,221 --> 01:34:36,971
for health reasons,

1587
01:34:36,971 --> 01:34:40,570
go back to eating meat again or eat some
animal products because these fish and

1588
01:34:40,870 --> 01:34:44,230
animals are fucking awesome.
I've loved the fact that Real,

1589
01:34:44,231 --> 01:34:45,250
I love that they're out there,

1590
01:34:45,251 --> 01:34:48,520
but if you think that it's okay
to have tons of mountain lions,

1591
01:34:48,521 --> 01:34:52,420
I have a buddy who works at [inaudible]
ranch. They got a trail camera.

1592
01:34:52,450 --> 01:34:53,440
They are over a pond.

1593
01:34:53,590 --> 01:34:57,070
They got photos of 16 different
mountain lines visiting this pond.

1594
01:34:58,040 --> 01:35:01,940
Yeah. What fuck man. I
shouldn't say it's this,

1595
01:35:02,090 --> 01:35:06,290
this is all because in the 1990s they
outlawed hunting up. It doesn't make,

1596
01:35:06,350 --> 01:35:10,130
they didn't do it for any rational is a
mountain lion as an apex Predator. Right.

1597
01:35:10,131 --> 01:35:12,800
It's an apex Predator and that you
can eat them and they're delicious.

1598
01:35:12,830 --> 01:35:16,550
They taste the pork. Yeah. Yeah.
My friend Steve Shot one recently,

1599
01:35:16,551 --> 01:35:19,280
he said it was one of the most delicious
meals he's ever had in his life.

1600
01:35:19,310 --> 01:35:22,970
I have to try it. Yeah. They have
delicious fat that you, you cook them,

1601
01:35:23,330 --> 01:35:25,370
Cook it just like poor.
I never would have thought that.

1602
01:35:25,670 --> 01:35:28,760
I never would have thought the cat family.
Right. Yeah. It's weird eating a cat.

1603
01:35:28,920 --> 01:35:31,790
Yeah. But apparently they're
delicious. Probably have before. Yeah.

1604
01:35:31,820 --> 01:35:36,060
Well unknowingly, but there's just a
control the population to keep them.

1605
01:35:36,900 --> 01:35:38,960
Good luck finding a deer in California.

1606
01:35:39,030 --> 01:35:42,800
Just like when you walk into the grocery
store and you see the meat aisle,

1607
01:35:43,160 --> 01:35:45,980
like do you just see animals sit in there?
You know what I mean? Cause you see,

1608
01:35:46,280 --> 01:35:50,780
I mean the meat aisle is gigantic as big
as this wall. And like when I see it,

1609
01:35:50,781 --> 01:35:55,700
I just see a bunch of animals. My man,
like none of these were treated right.

1610
01:35:55,701 --> 01:36:00,200
Raised right, killed, right.
And now they're packaged
like there's some glorious,

1611
01:36:00,201 --> 01:36:04,880
amazing food. Well, let's just soup.
It's too sanitized and sterilized.

1612
01:36:04,890 --> 01:36:05,723
It's weird.

1613
01:36:05,810 --> 01:36:09,290
And especially as someone who's killed
animals and quartered them up in the

1614
01:36:09,291 --> 01:36:12,890
field and carried them away and cut
them up and put them and wrap them and

1615
01:36:13,070 --> 01:36:16,460
vacuum seal them and put them in my
freezer and then thought about an aid them

1616
01:36:16,790 --> 01:36:19,700
like I've been there through the whole
process. So I look at the whole thing.

1617
01:36:19,701 --> 01:36:22,040
Totally different. Now when I go
to the butcher section, it's just,

1618
01:36:22,041 --> 01:36:25,670
I did that when I was like 10 years old.
So yeah. So you've been doing it forever?

1619
01:36:25,900 --> 01:36:28,250
Well, I haven't hunted since
I was like a teenager, but,

1620
01:36:28,640 --> 01:36:29,900
but you have and you know it.

1621
01:36:29,930 --> 01:36:32,500
So I just think maybe we used
to raise chickens and like,

1622
01:36:33,830 --> 01:36:36,560
my dad would be like,
go kill a chicken for dinner.

1623
01:36:36,890 --> 01:36:41,360
Like that was like my job sometimes.
So yeah. Hey, same thing. You know,

1624
01:36:41,361 --> 01:36:45,480
especially when you raised the animal
to right, he become cut to, you know,

1625
01:36:45,770 --> 01:36:50,540
have some compassion for it. And you
realize the chickens in particular,

1626
01:36:50,600 --> 01:36:54,050
uh, I mean way more so
with cattle and pays like,

1627
01:36:54,051 --> 01:36:57,660
you realize pigs are very smart, you
know, they're, they're intelligent and,

1628
01:36:57,661 --> 01:37:01,540
and like a dog. Yeah. Yeah.
I mean, I feel like, uh, I,

1629
01:37:01,570 --> 01:37:03,200
I know that technically
they're, that's smart, right.

1630
01:37:03,201 --> 01:37:07,970
But there's something different
about dogs, right? Yeah.
For whatever reason. Yeah.

1631
01:37:07,971 --> 01:37:09,020
There's something different about it.

1632
01:37:09,021 --> 01:37:12,050
Maybe just maybe just my bias
from what I've been taught from,

1633
01:37:12,620 --> 01:37:16,260
from a society or whatever, but
culturally, right? Yeah, yeah.

1634
01:37:16,270 --> 01:37:20,120
We have the animals that we like better.
Yeah, yeah, certainly. Yeah. I mean,

1635
01:37:20,121 --> 01:37:24,120
I felt terrible like killing some of
the pigs. Yeah, I'd imagine. Yeah.

1636
01:37:24,380 --> 01:37:27,050
And then you eat them and
you know, personally, I mean,

1637
01:37:27,051 --> 01:37:30,780
I always thought the grocery store
sausage and bacon tasted way better, but,

1638
01:37:31,880 --> 01:37:35,600
but I was like, man, that was
sorta my excuse. I was like, man,

1639
01:37:35,601 --> 01:37:37,100
this doesn't taste good.
I'm not sure if I want to eat it.

1640
01:37:37,101 --> 01:37:40,670
But in my head I'm thinking like,
man, I really feel bad for this guy.

1641
01:37:40,671 --> 01:37:43,740
I don't want to eat them, you know?
No, I know what you mean, man. It's,

1642
01:37:43,820 --> 01:37:47,660
we have a weird disconnect with food
in this country in particular and

1643
01:37:47,661 --> 01:37:52,250
especially in this day and age when you
have a majority of the people eating

1644
01:37:52,251 --> 01:37:56,100
meat and the majority of people never
seen any animal die and then get chopped

1645
01:37:56,100 --> 01:37:58,830
up and turned into meat and then eat it.
It's a,

1646
01:37:58,831 --> 01:38:01,350
there's always going to be this weird
disconnect and that's what you change that

1647
01:38:01,351 --> 01:38:06,210
though? Boy, I dunno. I Dunno if he can.
I just think it's one of the weird, it's,

1648
01:38:06,750 --> 01:38:08,520
it's the,
I don't think,

1649
01:38:09,030 --> 01:38:11,850
I think this society is an
amazing thing and what we've,

1650
01:38:11,851 --> 01:38:15,120
what we've accomplished where you
don't have to ever worry about food.

1651
01:38:15,300 --> 01:38:19,230
You can just go down the store right
down the street here and get a steak and

1652
01:38:19,231 --> 01:38:22,230
cook it and instantaneously
you don't have to kill it.

1653
01:38:22,231 --> 01:38:24,230
You don't have to dress it.
You don't have to do,

1654
01:38:24,330 --> 01:38:27,480
all these steps have been avoided.
They just give him a piece of paper.

1655
01:38:27,720 --> 01:38:32,460
That piece of paper gets you a steak.
It's just, it's amazing. You know,

1656
01:38:32,461 --> 01:38:37,110
you could go to a store down the corner
over here and you can get gasoline.

1657
01:38:37,260 --> 01:38:41,070
Some mother fucker had to go to the
Middle East, pull oil out of the ground,

1658
01:38:41,220 --> 01:38:44,640
refine it, put it in tanker
trucks, driving across the country,

1659
01:38:44,641 --> 01:38:48,110
pop it into a hole in the
ground. You Swipe up, swipe up,

1660
01:38:48,120 --> 01:38:51,330
piece of plastic through this
reader, the pleat, the it,

1661
01:38:51,331 --> 01:38:55,260
you punch in your area code or your
zip code, whatever the fuck it is.

1662
01:38:55,290 --> 01:38:58,860
Was it your zip code? Right?
You put the nozzle in your tank,

1663
01:38:58,861 --> 01:39:00,450
you fill your tank up with gas.

1664
01:39:00,451 --> 01:39:05,010
This fucking car that's designed by
engineers in a way you would never be able

1665
01:39:05,011 --> 01:39:08,730
to figure out on your own and you get
to turn the key and drive this thing

1666
01:39:08,731 --> 01:39:13,731
around and there's so many steps that
have been taken to make our lives way more

1667
01:39:13,741 --> 01:39:15,570
convenient. Yo, you'd have
to do all that anymore.

1668
01:39:15,660 --> 01:39:19,390
He had this thing in your hand and you
just push a button and some do shows show

1669
01:39:19,400 --> 01:39:23,820
for your fucking door with food or some
dude with a car and drives anywhere you

1670
01:39:23,821 --> 01:39:24,330
want to,

1671
01:39:24,330 --> 01:39:25,970
yeah. Drive where we go here. Yeah.

1672
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:31,770
He shows up with the animal that's been
slaughtered and cooked and cooked and

1673
01:39:31,771 --> 01:39:35,190
sterilized and BA got worried
about if it's healthy or not.

1674
01:39:35,360 --> 01:39:37,960
Like when I was in Cuba, they
hit, like I said, the red meat is,

1675
01:39:38,680 --> 01:39:42,330
I don't know if it's illegal or are
just very hard to come by or whatever,

1676
01:39:42,331 --> 01:39:47,180
but so we went to this sort of
black market stand and I mean,

1677
01:39:47,220 --> 01:39:48,280
I've got a picture of it.
I mean,

1678
01:39:48,281 --> 01:39:52,380
it's a table bigger than this table of
just red meat sitting out and there's

1679
01:39:52,381 --> 01:39:57,040
flies on it and the people are just
like, they're, yeah. So I want some,

1680
01:39:58,870 --> 01:40:00,780
you know, and it's all the
different cuts and everything.

1681
01:40:00,781 --> 01:40:05,010
Not cut up just terribly.
Right, right. Wow. Yeah.

1682
01:40:05,011 --> 01:40:09,060
We're lucky as shit man. And this is
the easiest time ever to be alive. Yeah,

1683
01:40:09,061 --> 01:40:12,590
it really is. Yeah. At least in
America. Yeah. At least in America.

1684
01:40:12,600 --> 01:40:16,140
Maybe not in some places.
No. I think that's why it's
good to visit other places,

1685
01:40:16,141 --> 01:40:20,310
man. Just to, just to get a look around
and see what it's like. What am I,

1686
01:40:20,311 --> 01:40:22,620
the reasons I want to go to Thailand.
Like I want to go there and train,

1687
01:40:22,830 --> 01:40:27,780
but only so much. I mean there's
like, I think that so much of the tie,

1688
01:40:27,810 --> 01:40:31,200
uh, skill training is already in
America that it's not going to,

1689
01:40:31,590 --> 01:40:34,170
you might get some details or
whatever over there, but they're,

1690
01:40:34,240 --> 01:40:38,070
they're also so traditional and so far
behind us in terms of, uh, you know,

1691
01:40:38,120 --> 01:40:41,370
at least in strength and conditioning
and proper ways of training and things

1692
01:40:41,371 --> 01:40:43,830
like that, that I, I don't
know how beneficial that is,

1693
01:40:43,831 --> 01:40:45,840
but I want to go over there
and see how they live. I mean,

1694
01:40:45,841 --> 01:40:47,840
they eat spiders and you know,

1695
01:40:47,850 --> 01:40:52,410
these insects and most people are
ultra poor over there and you know,

1696
01:40:52,411 --> 01:40:55,420
but you know, they're, they're all,
they're really Buddhist. Right.

1697
01:40:55,421 --> 01:40:59,380
And then I guess they
kind of, um, you know,

1698
01:40:59,381 --> 01:41:04,060
they drop their kids off at the fricking
Thai camp and just leave. Like, you know,

1699
01:41:04,061 --> 01:41:08,740
it's very strange to us. Yeah.
Yeah. I find it fascinating. Yeah,

1700
01:41:08,741 --> 01:41:11,560
I do too. I find it incredibly
fascinating. You know,

1701
01:41:11,561 --> 01:41:14,550
I talked to John Wayne Park quite a
bit about his experiences over there.

1702
01:41:14,570 --> 01:41:17,440
He went over there when he was real young
and lived over there and lived in Thai

1703
01:41:17,441 --> 01:41:21,210
camps live like a Thai credible
stories, you know, so it's,

1704
01:41:21,260 --> 01:41:23,380
it's just a very unique culture.
It just,

1705
01:41:23,590 --> 01:41:27,550
it helps you appreciate where you
live and puts things into perspective.

1706
01:41:28,780 --> 01:41:32,800
Yeah. And there and the, we'll say Japan,

1707
01:41:33,220 --> 01:41:36,060
you've been there I'm sure. Right? Yeah.
I've been in Japan. Yeah. Fascinating.

1708
01:41:36,100 --> 01:41:39,370
Fascinating. The shit out of me
to people being in a foreign land.

1709
01:41:39,390 --> 01:41:41,170
It's also like on another planet,

1710
01:41:41,620 --> 01:41:46,570
people standing in line to the subway
to get on the subway train. Yeah.

1711
01:41:47,680 --> 01:41:50,620
I was there for it.
We did like a military tour and I was,

1712
01:41:50,621 --> 01:41:55,390
I think Todd Duffy was there and uh,
was it a CB the way maybe,

1713
01:41:55,690 --> 01:41:56,523
but yeah,

1714
01:41:56,950 --> 01:42:01,660
you could see Todd from over top
of the crowd from like a mile away.

1715
01:42:01,720 --> 01:42:05,370
Right? Yeah. It's hilarious.
Yeah, it's interesting. Um,

1716
01:42:05,470 --> 01:42:08,110
how polite they are over
there. So polite. Yeah.

1717
01:42:08,170 --> 01:42:10,270
It's like there's so much
order and disciplines.

1718
01:42:10,271 --> 01:42:11,760
It's just completely fascinating.

1719
01:42:11,790 --> 01:42:14,740
I remember him on the subway train
or they're standing in line. Yeah.

1720
01:42:15,220 --> 01:42:19,090
I just wanted to walk to
the funnel with you guys.

1721
01:42:19,420 --> 01:42:21,880
You probably could have done it and they
probably wouldn't even said anything.

1722
01:42:21,890 --> 01:42:25,270
Well then we did another
one in Iraq or Middle East.

1723
01:42:25,330 --> 01:42:27,880
Eye Rack was one of the places or did we,
I can't remember,

1724
01:42:27,881 --> 01:42:31,000
but the Middle East and man,
those people will,

1725
01:42:31,001 --> 01:42:34,090
they will shove you right out of
the way. Right. Like, you know, you,

1726
01:42:34,091 --> 01:42:36,120
you funneling in through
the airport or something.

1727
01:42:36,540 --> 01:42:40,450
They're the rudest people
ever when it comes to, you
know, standing in line. Yeah.

1728
01:42:40,900 --> 01:42:44,220
You don't tell him about right. Yeah.
It's ridiculous. I mean, you know,

1729
01:42:44,340 --> 01:42:48,060
you say something to them. No, I don't
speak English or whatever. I don't know.

1730
01:42:48,640 --> 01:42:50,860
I don't speak your language either.
So I guess we're fucked.

1731
01:42:51,640 --> 01:42:55,720
How many different countries
have you fought in? Um, only, uh,

1732
01:42:57,020 --> 01:43:01,000
only two. Yeah, I thought in the UK. Is
it a big transition going over there?

1733
01:43:01,001 --> 01:43:03,280
Like the weight cuts got to be harder.

1734
01:43:03,281 --> 01:43:06,910
And the finding the right
food when I fought over there,

1735
01:43:08,380 --> 01:43:12,910
um, yeah, the Waco wasn't that bad.

1736
01:43:13,010 --> 01:43:16,150
Uh, you'll be finding
the, my food was terrible.

1737
01:43:16,180 --> 01:43:17,680
You said you've been on a ketogenic diet.

1738
01:43:17,681 --> 01:43:20,230
We were talking before the podcast
for the last what, three years?

1739
01:43:20,260 --> 01:43:21,041
About three years.
Yeah.

1740
01:43:21,041 --> 01:43:25,300
It was after I fought Johnny Hendricks
actually and I suffered a concussion and

1741
01:43:25,301 --> 01:43:30,301
that was what originally got me on to
the idea of doing a ketogenic diet and

1742
01:43:30,641 --> 01:43:33,160
then I fought Robbie Lawler next.

1743
01:43:33,670 --> 01:43:38,670
And why did the concussion get you on
the idea of having is good for Tbi and

1744
01:43:39,131 --> 01:43:42,460
concussion?
I mean that's the theory at least.

1745
01:43:42,461 --> 01:43:44,870
I don't think they have a lot
of proof that I know they have,

1746
01:43:44,871 --> 01:43:47,530
they've done some research on mice
but not necessarily in humans.

1747
01:43:47,531 --> 01:43:51,390
But did you feel when you
changed your diet, um,

1748
01:43:51,710 --> 01:43:55,520
in wasn't like initially was
there a struggle? Oh yeah.

1749
01:43:55,521 --> 01:43:59,870
The first couple of weeks
is terrible. Keto flu thing.
Yeah. I had a really bad, uh,

1750
01:43:59,900 --> 01:44:02,330
but I didn't do it after the hinder is
five, but I started reading about it then.

1751
01:44:02,331 --> 01:44:04,590
And then when I fought
Lawler, I missed weight. Um,

1752
01:44:04,640 --> 01:44:05,830
I think it was I half a or something.

1753
01:44:05,870 --> 01:44:07,340
That was the only time I've
ever missed weight my life.

1754
01:44:07,670 --> 01:44:10,730
I did everything exactly like
I'd done a hundred times before.

1755
01:44:10,740 --> 01:44:15,110
Me and my coach Tom Barrier, a west side
Barbell, we had everything planned out.

1756
01:44:15,111 --> 01:44:17,480
We had a notebook of, you know, this
is what we eat this day, this day,

1757
01:44:17,481 --> 01:44:20,810
this day and this day, this moment.
And everything's planned out.

1758
01:44:20,811 --> 01:44:25,130
We did everything exactly the same. Um,
ended up, you know, still missing weight.

1759
01:44:25,670 --> 01:44:30,560
And um, I, that was when I
realized my metabolism had changed.

1760
01:44:30,830 --> 01:44:34,620
So I started looking more and more
into different, uh, types of diets.

1761
01:44:34,621 --> 01:44:36,920
So I've always been my own Guinea pig.

1762
01:44:37,010 --> 01:44:40,840
That's sort of a blessing and a curse
for my, um, well that's why, you know,

1763
01:44:40,841 --> 01:44:43,280
I want to be a coach because I've,
uh,

1764
01:44:43,310 --> 01:44:46,580
I think I'll make it 10 times better
coach than I was a fighter because I have

1765
01:44:46,670 --> 01:44:49,150
experimented on myself.
I've is,

1766
01:44:49,151 --> 01:44:52,090
why have all these books and everything
and the problem with that, right. Is it,

1767
01:44:52,120 --> 01:44:53,570
you know,
you get a bad info too,

1768
01:44:53,630 --> 01:44:57,770
or you misinterpreted misunderstand it
and maybe it's for regular people and I'm

1769
01:44:57,771 --> 01:45:02,040
a high level athlete, et Cetera,
et cetera. So anyway, um, I,

1770
01:45:02,041 --> 01:45:04,530
I used it for one for
the concussion and to,

1771
01:45:04,660 --> 01:45:09,050
to sort of a metabolic shift
into a more fats and, uh,

1772
01:45:09,051 --> 01:45:09,960
I haven't missed weight sense.

1773
01:45:09,961 --> 01:45:13,880
So did you feel any benefit of switching
to key to genic tie it in terms of

1774
01:45:13,881 --> 01:45:18,830
performance? Um, you know, actually
felt a lack of benefit actually.

1775
01:45:18,860 --> 01:45:23,690
So some of the Max capacity lowered
immediately, so my prs went down, um,

1776
01:45:23,720 --> 01:45:27,330
over time, back up. Yeah. They
came back up. Yeah. So how
long, when did it go down?

1777
01:45:27,331 --> 01:45:31,280
Like right away? Like within, yeah,
within the first week or two. I mean,

1778
01:45:31,350 --> 01:45:34,580
they're completely shot few months to
really truly adapt, right? Yeah, exactly.

1779
01:45:34,581 --> 01:45:39,530
Yeah. And then, and what I've done now
over time is I've adapted the Diet to, um,

1780
01:45:40,310 --> 01:45:42,860
you know, a lot of, I do a
lot of different things now,

1781
01:45:42,861 --> 01:45:47,861
so I'm not as Ketogenic as I once
was where it was all Kito Kito Kid.

1782
01:45:48,320 --> 01:45:50,000
Now I don't even pay
attention to my ketones. Well,

1783
01:45:50,001 --> 01:45:52,880
I take that ketone ester like we
took earlier. I take that a lot,

1784
01:45:52,881 --> 01:45:56,180
which I fucking love. You probably feel
it right now. I like Shit's amazing.

1785
01:45:56,390 --> 01:46:00,740
It tastes like sucking on
Godzilla. It does. It's worse.

1786
01:46:01,370 --> 01:46:06,230
Maybe it's like, whoa, it's
terrible. Terrible. But I use that.

1787
01:46:06,231 --> 01:46:11,000
And then I used a, you know, regular
Quito, salt supplements, but that one,

1788
01:46:11,001 --> 01:46:15,410
you know, for performance actually
brings my performance up higher than, uh,

1789
01:46:15,430 --> 01:46:18,530
than I would usually go take that
ketone ester before you train,

1790
01:46:18,920 --> 01:46:22,300
how long before you train. So I
take it with some glucose, uh,

1791
01:46:22,340 --> 01:46:25,790
usually about 20 minutes before a train.
And you use those glucose packets?

1792
01:46:26,210 --> 01:46:29,330
Who makes those packets? I just,
whatever at the grocery store,

1793
01:46:29,331 --> 01:46:33,740
power mar or whatever, you
know, it doesn't matter.
It's just a matter of sugar.

1794
01:46:33,820 --> 01:46:36,650
Yeah. You just had to make sure we have
some sugar because of the hypoglycemic

1795
01:46:36,651 --> 01:46:40,640
effects. I don't drop your blood sugar,
but it's so potent is very, very potent.

1796
01:46:40,641 --> 01:46:43,400
Like our key tones are
probably in the three. Like,

1797
01:46:43,401 --> 01:46:46,020
I actually have my blood meter.
Maybe we'll check, but, uh,

1798
01:46:46,070 --> 01:46:51,060
probably in the three to five millimole
range right now. Um, but yeah,

1799
01:46:51,061 --> 01:46:52,590
so, you know, I do that and then,

1800
01:46:52,591 --> 01:46:56,010
but now I've adjusted it where I'm not
as concerned with staying in Ketosis

1801
01:46:56,011 --> 01:46:59,700
because the main concern with that is I
want to get the benefits for the brain

1802
01:46:59,730 --> 01:47:04,650
and, um, you know, the Tbi and
things like that. Um, now it's, uh,

1803
01:47:04,740 --> 01:47:07,830
um, when I get closer to a fight,
it's more about performance, right?

1804
01:47:07,831 --> 01:47:12,790
So add in some, I use like a
Yukon Starch, um, I use, um, uh,

1805
01:47:12,840 --> 01:47:13,770
like sweet potatoes.

1806
01:47:13,771 --> 01:47:17,100
He at a certain starches that don't
really affect your ketone levels quite as

1807
01:47:17,101 --> 01:47:18,540
much.
Um,

1808
01:47:19,590 --> 01:47:23,100
so that can bring my performance
up a lot better. Well,

1809
01:47:23,101 --> 01:47:26,660
I think there's a real issue with high
level athletes with the amount of workout

1810
01:47:26,661 --> 01:47:27,481
put that you put in,

1811
01:47:27,481 --> 01:47:30,480
that you probably need more
carbohydrates than the regular person.

1812
01:47:30,481 --> 01:47:35,250
It's on a ketogenic diet. I've
been, I've been, uh, again,

1813
01:47:35,251 --> 01:47:39,870
I'm my own Guinea pig,
right? And I experiment with
that and I've been married,

1814
01:47:39,900 --> 01:47:43,830
I've been kind of torn with that. Right?
So one of the things that, that, uh, uh,

1815
01:47:43,930 --> 01:47:48,900
are a lot of people will kind of propagate
is that our sport is very anaerobic

1816
01:47:48,901 --> 01:47:49,620
and it's really not.

1817
01:47:49,620 --> 01:47:53,340
It's a lot more Robic and your
aerobic capacity will go up on Kido.

1818
01:47:53,341 --> 01:47:54,174
You're Rebecca,

1819
01:47:54,400 --> 01:47:58,380
you're my ability to recover
specifically without even with no carbs.

1820
01:47:58,381 --> 01:48:02,850
Ma My blood glucose could be a seventies
and eighties and not have carbs for

1821
01:48:02,851 --> 01:48:05,880
weeks at a time. And my ability to
recover it goes up tremendously.

1822
01:48:06,540 --> 01:48:10,140
We're talking about tendonitis. My
tendonitis goes away, my injuries,

1823
01:48:10,141 --> 01:48:12,990
my joints just feel better.
I feel better all the way around.

1824
01:48:12,991 --> 01:48:17,100
My brain feels better. And uh,
um, a lot of things like that.

1825
01:48:17,101 --> 01:48:18,360
But the,

1826
01:48:18,990 --> 01:48:22,410
but when you do need to
kick in that mass capacity,

1827
01:48:22,411 --> 01:48:27,090
anaerobic part of things, that's
where, you know, things suffer.

1828
01:48:27,300 --> 01:48:31,440
Suffer. Yeah. And that's where you have
to add in the carbs and, but again,

1829
01:48:31,441 --> 01:48:33,330
you know, the, the amount of
training that I do, I mean,

1830
01:48:33,331 --> 01:48:36,690
I can add in a lot of carbs and I
can still get away with it and stay,

1831
01:48:36,691 --> 01:48:39,090
and I can even stay in Ketosis if,
if I want to.

1832
01:48:39,090 --> 01:48:42,510
But I think a lot of people make
the mistake that I made originally,

1833
01:48:42,840 --> 01:48:44,390
again is my own Guinea pig.
And,

1834
01:48:44,440 --> 01:48:49,440
and I really focused on the blood ketone
levels rather than the performance.

1835
01:48:50,490 --> 01:48:55,190
And I wanted to be able to perform with
high key to genic levels, you know,

1836
01:48:55,340 --> 01:49:00,090
high ketone levels, um, and in my blood,
and it's not really necessary. Right.

1837
01:49:00,091 --> 01:49:04,230
I think it should be solely performance
based, but it did. It did help me. Cut.

1838
01:49:04,231 --> 01:49:06,690
Wait though, I thought it was fascinating
with Ben. Greenfield was saying,

1839
01:49:06,691 --> 01:49:10,110
we were talking about it
before the podcast about how
he would carve up and then

1840
01:49:10,111 --> 01:49:11,490
take ketone supplements.

1841
01:49:11,640 --> 01:49:15,480
So we had the benefit of having a
lot of carbohydrates in the system,

1842
01:49:15,481 --> 01:49:17,520
but also having a lot of
ketones in the system.

1843
01:49:17,521 --> 01:49:21,870
And he said he felt like a fucking
animal. Yeah. And that's pretty similar.

1844
01:49:21,871 --> 01:49:25,320
It's probably how we feel right now. I
mean, that's totally legal. Totally. Yeah.

1845
01:49:25,380 --> 01:49:28,090
I mean that's not, and I'll tell
you like when I take it, uh, it,

1846
01:49:28,091 --> 01:49:32,790
it does amazing things
for me. Um, men. I, I've,

1847
01:49:33,700 --> 01:49:36,660
so I've heard stories of people when they
take this Esther that they'll pull out

1848
01:49:36,661 --> 01:49:41,490
moves like they haven't done in 10 years.
Like they recalls these moves and um,

1849
01:49:41,530 --> 01:49:45,870
I've done things where when I do it, I
feel like I'm five, six years younger.

1850
01:49:46,320 --> 01:49:49,280
I mean it's done some fascinating
things taking that drink,

1851
01:49:49,281 --> 01:49:54,190
just taken the Ester with some uh,
um,

1852
01:49:54,650 --> 01:49:58,330
some get digging out of the trash,
pulling it out here. Yeah. It ketone aid,

1853
01:49:58,690 --> 01:49:59,530
ketone aid,

1854
01:49:59,560 --> 01:50:04,360
ketone Ester and it looks like you're
a scientist like this breaking bad type

1855
01:50:04,361 --> 01:50:06,370
shit.
The thing with it,

1856
01:50:06,380 --> 01:50:10,600
it's extremely expensive and they're
working on getting the, uh, it's,

1857
01:50:10,610 --> 01:50:14,690
it's like burnt rubber there. You
were working on getting the um, uh,

1858
01:50:14,800 --> 01:50:18,580
the cost down. I think he's thinking
how much of these things, I'm not sure,

1859
01:50:18,581 --> 01:50:21,910
but I think it's like $30 a
gram and that's like 40 grams.

1860
01:50:21,911 --> 01:50:25,160
I think that's incredible. I could be
off on that. I'm not sure. But, uh,

1861
01:50:25,270 --> 01:50:26,260
that's quite pricey.

1862
01:50:26,320 --> 01:50:31,000
I heard that the UK cycling team used it.

1863
01:50:31,001 --> 01:50:35,290
They paid like $6,000 for,
you know,

1864
01:50:35,380 --> 01:50:38,770
however much, just a small
amount. And they used it for the,

1865
01:50:38,800 --> 01:50:42,640
when they won the Tour de France actually.
Wow. I don't know how true it is,

1866
01:50:42,641 --> 01:50:46,130
but I believe it. I mean this
shit does amazing things for him.

1867
01:50:46,150 --> 01:50:50,140
But yeah, so the Kido, I mean again,

1868
01:50:50,141 --> 01:50:53,680
it can be used if used properly.
I think it can do a lot of benefits.

1869
01:50:53,681 --> 01:50:56,140
I would recommend to all,
um,

1870
01:50:57,100 --> 01:51:01,230
as a combat athletes and
NFL players over there,

1871
01:51:01,450 --> 01:51:05,410
they've taken concussions taking his
sort of brain or that are over a certain

1872
01:51:05,411 --> 01:51:09,040
age where your metabolism changes. I
mean that's where my biggest benefit was.

1873
01:51:09,041 --> 01:51:11,590
And even a Tj was talking
about the t TJ Dillashaw.

1874
01:51:11,591 --> 01:51:12,430
I was talking with him about it.

1875
01:51:12,431 --> 01:51:16,030
His coach had him switch ever cause he
was burning primarily carbohydrates.

1876
01:51:16,690 --> 01:51:21,210
Especially now TJ is going to try
to make one 25. And I don't know if

1877
01:51:22,980 --> 01:51:26,700
he was talking to me about long before
that was ever talked about. So, but he,

1878
01:51:26,701 --> 01:51:27,010
you know,

1879
01:51:27,010 --> 01:51:31,060
he did some tests on him and found that
he's burning all carbohydrate all the

1880
01:51:31,061 --> 01:51:34,510
time, which can be an issue in long
training sessions specifically.

1881
01:51:34,600 --> 01:51:38,620
So he switched it up a bit.
Yeah. And I don't, I don't
think he's going full Quito,

1882
01:51:38,621 --> 01:51:41,260
but I think he's doing something similar
to like what I'm doing, where the,

1883
01:51:41,500 --> 01:51:45,550
he's doing Kido with, uh, you know, some
carbohydrates still and he's using the,

1884
01:51:45,820 --> 01:51:49,300
so basically like the only carbohydrates
that we need as an athlete is for the

1885
01:51:49,301 --> 01:51:53,080
workout. Right. We don't need them after
that. Um, you know, maybe for recovery,

1886
01:51:53,620 --> 01:51:57,070
which is a, again, I think it's
debatable, but um, you know,

1887
01:51:57,071 --> 01:52:00,560
carbohydrate is not a necessary
substance to even live. You know,

1888
01:52:00,600 --> 01:52:04,270
you could live your entire life without
eating a carbohydrate and be perfectly

1889
01:52:04,271 --> 01:52:04,570
fine.

1890
01:52:04,570 --> 01:52:04,981
Yeah.

1891
01:52:04,981 --> 01:52:08,700
There's a lot of guys that are doing this
carnivore diet now I've heard of this.

1892
01:52:08,701 --> 01:52:12,720
Yeah. Mark Bell told me he's never felt
better. He's always doing that shit now.

1893
01:52:12,750 --> 01:52:15,630
Yeah. Yeah. He's, he's
eaten nothing but steak.

1894
01:52:16,830 --> 01:52:20,370
Steak all day. No sausage
or bacon. It's bacon too,

1895
01:52:20,371 --> 01:52:24,230
but it's mostly me and he's eaten
mostly me. Mostly me. So what,

1896
01:52:24,250 --> 01:52:26,220
no vegetables a little
bit every now and then.

1897
01:52:26,221 --> 01:52:28,290
But most of what he's eating
is just meets the eye.

1898
01:52:28,350 --> 01:52:32,040
I feel completely different
when I load up my vegetables.

1899
01:52:32,520 --> 01:52:36,210
Even if a day or two. I mean,
I don't know. Do you feel
this? I don't feel better.

1900
01:52:36,300 --> 01:52:40,950
Yeah. I'm a big family thing. I just,
I love drinking it too. You know,

1901
01:52:40,951 --> 01:52:45,951
I love getting like real rich
green leafy vegetable and a,

1902
01:52:46,640 --> 01:52:50,630
I drink a lot of Kale shakes while
I'll take a Goddamn Bushel of Kale that

1903
01:52:50,631 --> 01:52:53,360
you're never going to sit down and eat.
You're never going to eat that much Kale.

1904
01:52:53,540 --> 01:52:57,980
I'll blend that motherfucker up with
a giant chunk of ginger and garlic.

1905
01:52:57,981 --> 01:53:01,520
I'll throw an apple in there and a
bunch of coconut oil and I'll fuck on,

1906
01:53:04,310 --> 01:53:07,060
throw some salary in there and
I'll drink it and it's, Ooh,

1907
01:53:07,130 --> 01:53:09,720
I think I've seen that on youtube. You
put like a pair in there too, right? Yeah.

1908
01:53:09,860 --> 01:53:12,110
Maybe a pay or maybe an apple.
I'll mix it up.

1909
01:53:12,111 --> 01:53:14,220
Sometimes I put peaches
or pineapple in there too.

1910
01:53:14,290 --> 01:53:15,890
You put the whole day with
the seeds and everything.

1911
01:53:16,010 --> 01:53:20,130
A fucking throw that bitch
and grind it up and just,

1912
01:53:20,330 --> 01:53:23,750
it's all performance. It doesn't
taste good. It tastes like shit.

1913
01:53:23,980 --> 01:53:27,080
And it's like people try to
drink it and they're like, yeah,

1914
01:53:27,180 --> 01:53:30,600
oh I can't did I got to try this.
But dude,

1915
01:53:30,601 --> 01:53:33,360
I drink it and I feel like a
fucking gorilla. How much garlic?

1916
01:53:33,361 --> 01:53:37,200
You put it in a lot. Like four or
five cloves. That's, it's rough.

1917
01:53:37,230 --> 01:53:39,150
I just eat cloves now.
Yeah, I do that too.

1918
01:53:39,151 --> 01:53:41,990
I eat a lot of close work
burns when it's going down,

1919
01:53:42,930 --> 01:53:45,570
but you could feel it within like
an hour or two. You're like, damn,

1920
01:53:45,571 --> 01:53:48,480
there's something in there man.
Especially if I'm feeling anything,

1921
01:53:48,810 --> 01:53:51,120
like I'm feeling a little
sick and feeling funky,

1922
01:53:51,470 --> 01:53:53,920
like kind of feeling a little worn down.
Maybe it's going around.

1923
01:53:53,921 --> 01:53:58,830
I'll just chomp on some garlic.
You ever tried Chaga route?
No, I do this. I did it.

1924
01:53:58,860 --> 01:54:02,370
Well. I've only done it one time when
I was sick. My whole family got sick.

1925
01:54:02,371 --> 01:54:06,000
Kids that you've been there,
right? Kids are miserable.

1926
01:54:06,120 --> 01:54:09,840
All of this are laying down like we're
laying around like where in the hospital?

1927
01:54:09,840 --> 01:54:11,970
You know, every couple
of seconds here, cough.

1928
01:54:11,971 --> 01:54:15,660
And where I was laying there miserable
and I was the only one that did the

1929
01:54:15,661 --> 01:54:20,460
chocolate route. I put it in a crock
pot, put 10, a little chunks in there.

1930
01:54:20,461 --> 01:54:23,850
And I was the only one that didn't get
sick or didn't stay sick very long.

1931
01:54:23,851 --> 01:54:26,790
I stayed sick for like a day or two,
maybe Haga route.

1932
01:54:27,090 --> 01:54:29,400
What's supposed to be the
benefit of this stuff? Man,

1933
01:54:29,940 --> 01:54:34,290
I don't want to butcher this.
Google it. Yeah. Yeah, I can't,

1934
01:54:34,360 --> 01:54:37,520
I mean it's an immune system
enhancer. It's like, uh, it,

1935
01:54:37,650 --> 01:54:42,650
I heard it from my friend who's a
survivalist specialist expert and he like,

1936
01:54:42,801 --> 01:54:44,640
he teaches these classes,
you know,

1937
01:54:44,641 --> 01:54:48,630
where you go out and live off the land
and things like that. Right. And um,

1938
01:54:48,930 --> 01:54:49,171
you know,

1939
01:54:49,171 --> 01:54:53,490
he gets it from like Maine or Canada
and it's like his fungus that grows on

1940
01:54:53,491 --> 01:54:56,910
trees and it's really, really hard
and they chop it off and then you can,

1941
01:54:56,940 --> 01:55:00,840
you grind it up, put it in a tea or
something and supposedly, you know,

1942
01:55:00,841 --> 01:55:03,030
it's really good for immune system.
Why does it make you feel?

1943
01:55:03,390 --> 01:55:05,580
I don't feel anything. I didn't
feel any difference at all. I mean,

1944
01:55:05,581 --> 01:55:06,381
I'm sitting there drinking it.

1945
01:55:06,381 --> 01:55:09,400
It like it was some bullshit and
I'm drinking it anyway. I'll try it.

1946
01:55:09,440 --> 01:55:13,180
And you know, my guy told
me, so, um, you know,

1947
01:55:13,200 --> 01:55:18,200
nuts obviously it's very anecdotal and
it was like one instance and I just like,

1948
01:55:18,591 --> 01:55:22,800
I just got sick a couple weeks ago and
I completely forgot about and I was sick

1949
01:55:22,801 --> 01:55:23,700
for like two weeks.
But

1950
01:55:25,250 --> 01:55:28,450
you had a pretty significant back injury
at one point when I herniated disk.

1951
01:55:28,980 --> 01:55:33,540
How did you fix that? Um, I guess
it's never really fixed. Fixed, right.

1952
01:55:33,570 --> 01:55:34,320
Um,

1953
01:55:34,320 --> 01:55:38,890
I got an epidural steroid injection first
because I wanted to make the fight is

1954
01:55:38,891 --> 01:55:40,320
what I'm supposed to fight.
Conduct the first time.

1955
01:55:40,450 --> 01:55:42,480
It was like two weeks out
of the fight and does it,

1956
01:55:42,540 --> 01:55:47,310
what the epidural steroids does it relax
the area and loosen the inflammation?

1957
01:55:47,340 --> 01:55:52,320
A corticosteroid, right? Yeah. So it
gets rid of inflammation. It took mine,

1958
01:55:52,321 --> 01:55:56,610
um, and we did it on a Friday. This
was like two weeks out of the fight.

1959
01:55:56,900 --> 01:55:57,733
Um,

1960
01:55:57,780 --> 01:56:01,500
so what had happened is about four weeks
out of the fight is when I originally

1961
01:56:01,501 --> 01:56:02,790
heard it and you know,

1962
01:56:02,791 --> 01:56:05,510
how am I coming off fucking suck it up
and do I think you said you herniated

1963
01:56:05,520 --> 01:56:07,050
disc,
so you know what it feels like right now.

1964
01:56:07,470 --> 01:56:10,710
I'm a suck the shit up and I'm going
to get through it. And you know,

1965
01:56:10,711 --> 01:56:13,860
I couldn't do anything. I could
barely even hit pads. Right. Um,

1966
01:56:14,370 --> 01:56:18,510
well I eventually ended up, you
know, going to a, well actually,

1967
01:56:18,511 --> 01:56:20,820
so this is part of my problem
with Chiropractors, right?

1968
01:56:20,821 --> 01:56:24,030
So I went to a chiropractor first
and he's like, Oh yeah, you know,

1969
01:56:24,430 --> 01:56:29,100
crack it and it's all good, you know,
and all this kind of uh, garbage. Anyway.

1970
01:56:29,101 --> 01:56:33,720
I know I be seeing a pain specialist and
he knew what it was within 30 seconds.

1971
01:56:33,721 --> 01:56:37,560
Yeah. Anyway, so I got the epidural
steroid and it didn't work right away,

1972
01:56:37,590 --> 01:56:42,590
so I had to get a second
one later. So, Eh, yeah.

1973
01:56:42,640 --> 01:56:46,030
The second time, that's the issue,
right? Is it mass the issue?

1974
01:56:46,320 --> 01:56:50,130
I think it's due to some of
the inflammation. So some
of the problems of it. Yeah.

1975
01:56:50,131 --> 01:56:52,860
So that's it. I mean, he, and he
told me that he said, you know, look,

1976
01:56:52,870 --> 01:56:54,210
we're going to get you to the fight.

1977
01:56:54,930 --> 01:56:57,240
This is the best way to
get you to the fight.

1978
01:56:57,720 --> 01:56:59,520
But it didn't work well
enough the first time,

1979
01:56:59,521 --> 01:57:02,790
so I end up getting a second one and
it worked very well the second time.

1980
01:57:02,791 --> 01:57:07,080
But then of course as you know,
having a herniated disc, a,

1981
01:57:07,081 --> 01:57:10,460
it just took years to correct it,
you know,

1982
01:57:10,510 --> 01:57:14,910
and I mean I work on all the time
now if I, if I don't keep on it,

1983
01:57:14,911 --> 01:57:19,770
then I will feel the, the
fat, I'll fill the issues,

1984
01:57:21,050 --> 01:57:24,930
especially in Jujitsu as a worst time.
Is your lower back

1985
01:57:26,700 --> 01:57:27,391
l five I think.

1986
01:57:27,391 --> 01:57:30,840
Did you use Louie Simmons a reverse
hyper did use that machine to that?

1987
01:57:30,841 --> 01:57:35,790
Of course. Yeah. Yeah, of
course. I do tons of the
reverse hyper all the time. Um,

1988
01:57:36,060 --> 01:57:39,510
I mean I have a whole routine that I
do pretty much after pretty much every

1989
01:57:39,511 --> 01:57:44,220
workout. Just to strengthen your
back. Yup. Yup. Far Back and hips.

1990
01:57:44,280 --> 01:57:49,260
A lot of my personal problem
with my hip mobility and uh,

1991
01:57:49,980 --> 01:57:51,710
so I do the hips, a, uh,

1992
01:57:52,170 --> 01:57:55,680
abs obliques as gets real tight.

1993
01:57:55,681 --> 01:58:00,520
So I have to lay on a fucking
kettle bell, that thing, you know,

1994
01:58:01,230 --> 01:58:05,940
my hip flexors. But, um, you know,

1995
01:58:05,941 --> 01:58:10,110
I started working with this a strength
conditioning coach. Now that Amanda,

1996
01:58:10,111 --> 01:58:12,060
you know, he does, he
works wonders for me.

1997
01:58:12,510 --> 01:58:15,070
Now you have your own bind the shit
and you sent us a bunch of stuff,

1998
01:58:15,650 --> 01:58:18,180
some fucking cool hammers and,
and uh,

1999
01:58:18,181 --> 01:58:20,070
you got wheel barrels and a
bunch of different things.

2000
01:58:20,250 --> 01:58:24,180
What was your thought process behind,
what was the name of the company? Uh,

2001
01:58:24,181 --> 01:58:28,720
in mortal combat equipment?
Ice and there's it on a
online, the mortal Kombat, so,

2002
01:58:28,840 --> 01:58:33,440
well I have my website and mortal
kind of equipment.ceo and then, uh,

2003
01:58:33,550 --> 01:58:37,500
it's on west side barbell.
We sell on their distributed
to them an elite fts.com.

2004
01:58:37,980 --> 01:58:42,640
And um, basically the way
that whole started was go,
oh, there we go. Nice. Yeah.

2005
01:58:42,641 --> 01:58:45,460
The way that whole started,
the whole thing started was with the,

2006
01:58:45,880 --> 01:58:50,470
the wheelbarrows. Louie
had a, a wheelbarrow that
we was using all the time.

2007
01:58:50,480 --> 01:58:54,910
He's used for probably
20 years. And, um, we,

2008
01:58:55,900 --> 01:58:59,590
I was like, man, I, you know, I could
build, that thing's a piece of junk.

2009
01:58:59,591 --> 01:59:02,640
He's been around here like 20 years.
It's fallen apart. And I said, you know,

2010
01:59:02,980 --> 01:59:04,810
let me build one. And, uh, we built, one,

2011
01:59:05,320 --> 01:59:07,720
one person asked me to build
one for him is okay, cool.

2012
01:59:07,720 --> 01:59:10,780
And then another person asked me to
build one for him and then I said, man,

2013
01:59:10,870 --> 01:59:14,410
Oh man, I should just start making
these. And I'd had the ideas for the, uh,

2014
01:59:14,500 --> 01:59:19,460
so I talked to a engineer and a,
we just started manufacturing them and uh,

2015
01:59:19,540 --> 01:59:21,910
you know, just, it's sort of
like a side project thing for me.

2016
01:59:21,911 --> 01:59:26,830
So something I want to get into a post,
a fight career, you know, like I said,

2017
01:59:26,840 --> 01:59:30,430
he's a few things I want to do, you know,
for one strength conditioning, coaching,

2018
01:59:30,431 --> 01:59:34,740
martial arts, coaching, uh, you know, do
some stuff with muscle farm and, you know,

2019
01:59:34,750 --> 01:59:37,330
I want to, uh, you know, be able
to sell my equipment. Right. Um,

2020
01:59:37,450 --> 01:59:39,790
the hammers I thought for a
long time, um, I don't know,

2021
01:59:39,791 --> 01:59:42,220
like you guys do the Macy's, you know,
these are different than the masons.

2022
01:59:42,710 --> 01:59:46,640
The actually sledgehammer, right? I'm
sure if you swing a sledge hammer,

2023
01:59:46,970 --> 01:59:50,620
it just doesn't make sense that you go
to home depot and you buy a shit ass 16

2024
01:59:50,621 --> 01:59:53,880
pounds, 20 pounds, sledge hammer.
Our start at 15 pounds off,

2025
01:59:53,881 --> 01:59:56,830
probably make it a 10 pound at some point,
maybe an eight or seven or something.

2026
01:59:57,250 --> 02:00:01,670
And um, you know, they're usually
they're square. They're um, you know,

2027
02:00:01,690 --> 02:00:05,170
it doesn't make any sense. Right? So we
just made it specifically for swinging,

2028
02:00:05,380 --> 02:00:10,000
for training, for training and then, yeah,
good fat handling and you see also a,

2029
02:00:10,001 --> 02:00:12,910
it has a ball on the end in case it
slips out. So it keeps it in your hand.

2030
02:00:13,180 --> 02:00:17,860
And it never made sense to me that I
would see a 200 pound man and 125 pound

2031
02:00:17,861 --> 02:00:21,390
woman bus swinging the same sledgehammer.
Right. Especially these 200 pound men,

2032
02:00:21,740 --> 02:00:24,970
you know, like me. Like I swing
the 30, 35 pounds, such hammer,

2033
02:00:25,240 --> 02:00:27,610
which got to try is just insanely hard,

2034
02:00:27,611 --> 02:00:31,480
but you have to have it right technique
and everything. Um, but you know,

2035
02:00:31,510 --> 02:00:35,440
I swing that from my workout and uh,
for different,

2036
02:00:35,441 --> 02:00:38,470
I mean there's different things depending
on are you gonna expand your line

2037
02:00:38,471 --> 02:00:41,520
because you've got absolutely just the,
right now you've got the sledges,

2038
02:00:41,530 --> 02:00:45,730
those three in the wheelbarrow and the
grip balls. Now the grip balls, do they,

2039
02:00:45,750 --> 02:00:48,700
what do you put them on it?
Like a carabiner or something
like that and do chin,

2040
02:00:49,120 --> 02:00:50,740
yeah. Connected to anything. I actually,

2041
02:00:50,880 --> 02:00:54,130
if you see on that video who we connected
to the wheelbarrow and carry the

2042
02:00:54,131 --> 02:00:57,130
wheelbarrow. I love doing
that. Tons of things.

2043
02:00:57,131 --> 02:01:01,400
I mean there's just a tons of
options. That's that one. My kids,

2044
02:01:01,500 --> 02:01:04,600
they were little baby kettle bells. They
were doing kettlebell swings and shit.

2045
02:01:04,920 --> 02:01:08,680
Nice, Nice, Nice. Um, I have
some bad ass ideas, man.

2046
02:01:08,681 --> 02:01:13,520
We're going to build some really,
really cool stuff. Um, you know,

2047
02:01:13,570 --> 02:01:16,030
I don't know. I guess I could just say
I don't, I don't really care. I mean,

2048
02:01:16,031 --> 02:01:18,840
you know, like when you use the belt
squat before, right? We're going to,

2049
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:22,900
I'm working on prototyping one right now.
I have actually about 10 prototypes.

2050
02:01:22,901 --> 02:01:24,820
I just haven't had the time,
energy to focus.

2051
02:01:25,060 --> 02:01:28,540
I kind of like almost don't want it to
grow too fast because like I'm still

2052
02:01:28,541 --> 02:01:31,790
fighting is something I want to
work on after fighting. And um,

2053
02:01:32,460 --> 02:01:35,650
basically we would do a belt squat that
you can walk with so it's just going to

2054
02:01:35,651 --> 02:01:40,010
have wheels and he'd just
walk around anywhere with it
and you could sort of, um,

2055
02:01:40,550 --> 02:01:42,950
you know, even like, you know, clinch
was somewhat aware of what she, I mean,

2056
02:01:42,951 --> 02:01:44,870
you can do a ton of things
like that with the west side,

2057
02:01:45,260 --> 02:01:46,400
a belt squat they already have.

2058
02:01:46,401 --> 02:01:48,830
And there is other belt squats
that can do similar things.

2059
02:01:48,830 --> 02:01:52,190
But the other west side one, they were
telling me you could hit pads for sure.

2060
02:01:52,191 --> 02:01:53,550
I have somebody on the plan,
which I do,

2061
02:01:54,670 --> 02:01:58,160
which I do thing just the way
it loads up your hips like that.

2062
02:01:58,161 --> 02:02:01,910
And it seems like one of the things I
think you'd, you'd probably really like,

2063
02:02:02,630 --> 02:02:05,840
we're going to build, um, and
they have one at west side.

2064
02:02:05,841 --> 02:02:07,880
You may have seen it when you went there.
The forest treadmill,

2065
02:02:08,270 --> 02:02:11,370
that's just the one at west side.
I mean it's just a basic tremor.

2066
02:02:11,390 --> 02:02:15,410
Like if you buy one off like Woodway
or whatever, they're like 3000, 4,000,

2067
02:02:15,411 --> 02:02:18,470
I think it would be like five or $6,000.
I'm going to build one.

2068
02:02:18,471 --> 02:02:21,010
You could sell for like
five, 600 bucks. You know,

2069
02:02:21,050 --> 02:02:22,910
like you just put it in your garage,
whatever.

2070
02:02:23,140 --> 02:02:27,630
Like you don't need to buy a
$5,000 Woodway treadmill. Right.

2071
02:02:27,980 --> 02:02:31,190
Why did you decide to start out with
the hammers and wheel barrels? Well,

2072
02:02:31,191 --> 02:02:34,670
the hammers I wanted for myself.
Is that something you use all the time?

2073
02:02:34,700 --> 02:02:39,210
Absolutely. He's probably my favorite
exercise. I mean, of course there's,

2074
02:02:39,260 --> 02:02:41,420
every exercise is a tool,
right? And you know,

2075
02:02:41,421 --> 02:02:44,660
you don't use a socket wrench on
screw. Right? So, you know, we have a,

2076
02:02:45,020 --> 02:02:48,530
there's a million different exercises
that we do for MMA. Everybody asks me,

2077
02:02:48,531 --> 02:02:51,090
what do you do? Like you name it,
I'd probably do it. Right. Uh,

2078
02:02:51,260 --> 02:02:55,910
my favorite hammers are probably my
favorite thing though. Um, if there's,

2079
02:02:55,911 --> 02:02:59,330
if I just had to pick one thing and
say this is what you need to do. Um,

2080
02:03:00,260 --> 02:03:03,740
I mean the dynamic strength that builds
is, is insane. The explosiveness,

2081
02:03:03,741 --> 02:03:06,200
the core strength, the shoulder
strength, that grip strength.

2082
02:03:06,201 --> 02:03:10,220
Did you start doing this? Um, four or five
years ago, because I remember, you know,

2083
02:03:10,221 --> 02:03:13,550
back in the day George Foreman used to
chop wood and I remember thinking like,

2084
02:03:13,551 --> 02:03:15,860
why aren't you, yeah, I was
like, why are they chopping wood?

2085
02:03:16,220 --> 02:03:19,350
Like Wah Marianna was legendary for
doing it or not letting her hear him.

2086
02:03:19,351 --> 02:03:23,210
He's legendary for other
things. He did a lot. Yeah.

2087
02:03:23,300 --> 02:03:28,300
So we actually built a 45 and a 50 pound
hammer to which became a really good

2088
02:03:29,211 --> 02:03:34,100
doorstopper but heavy. Yeah. So
we've maxed out, we stopped at 35,

2089
02:03:34,101 --> 02:03:38,390
but if anybody ever would want one, we can
still blows the Francis. I know, right?

2090
02:03:40,800 --> 02:03:45,110
I like to see him do it. Yeah. I mean, if
you just think about the way, you know,

2091
02:03:45,111 --> 02:03:47,450
the, the, the hammer
swings and everything,

2092
02:03:47,451 --> 02:03:50,210
I mean there's a lot of
different ways you can do it.

2093
02:03:50,211 --> 02:03:53,240
There's a lot of different exercises you
can do with them. I mean they're just,

2094
02:03:53,600 --> 02:03:56,470
I think they're most amazing
tool there is for framing.

2095
02:03:56,480 --> 02:04:01,040
May I've never used one really even
like a Home Depot Sledge Hammer? Nope.

2096
02:04:01,340 --> 02:04:05,400
Never swung them. No. I mean it'll
build your endurance up right away. Um,

2097
02:04:05,670 --> 02:04:09,770
well one thing that I love about the
endurance part of it is you'll sit there

2098
02:04:09,771 --> 02:04:13,790
and swing it and like
your body's going to like,

2099
02:04:13,791 --> 02:04:16,280
when your body gets so tired,
as long as you have decent techniques,

2100
02:04:16,310 --> 02:04:19,670
your body will get so tired. You
can still keep going though. Like,

2101
02:04:19,671 --> 02:04:21,920
cause it's a lot of momentum,
you know what I mean?

2102
02:04:21,920 --> 02:04:26,270
But you can keep going with the
momentum no matter how tired you are.

2103
02:04:26,390 --> 02:04:28,670
Now you sent me some,
so I'll start doing it here.

2104
02:04:28,671 --> 02:04:33,370
And what size tire should I get? A
tractor tire? Yeah, if we get, yeah,

2105
02:04:33,400 --> 02:04:38,110
just tractor tire. What do you get one of
those? Um, I know I just go to the, uh,

2106
02:04:38,130 --> 02:04:40,770
you could use a regular tire whenever,
like I go to like the uh,

2107
02:04:41,550 --> 02:04:42,341
you can get for free.

2108
02:04:42,341 --> 02:04:44,960
He usually they'll give them to you
because they just burn them. Okay.

2109
02:04:45,020 --> 02:04:48,840
You know what I have to like dispose
them like a tire shop. Tire shop. Yeah.

2110
02:04:48,841 --> 02:04:52,500
Junk tire shop. Yeah. I'll go a tire shop.
Yeah. Give me a big ass tire bitch. Yeah,

2111
02:04:53,040 --> 02:04:57,910
that's what I did. I mean sometimes like
they might give you like a regular um,

2112
02:04:58,340 --> 02:05:02,430
uh, tire. Also. You just bolt it
together, you know, drill a hole in bolt,

2113
02:05:02,431 --> 02:05:05,040
two of them together and you got it.
You do that way too.

2114
02:05:05,041 --> 02:05:07,060
But is that what you did?
You put stack I,

2115
02:05:07,110 --> 02:05:10,560
that's what I'm [inaudible] I've had
to do that before where the tire shop

2116
02:05:10,561 --> 02:05:11,011
wouldn't,

2117
02:05:11,011 --> 02:05:14,820
didn't have a big tractor tire and
I'd just get sick of looking for one.

2118
02:05:14,821 --> 02:05:16,590
Sometimes it hard to find
like farmers will have them,

2119
02:05:16,770 --> 02:05:19,800
I don't know about California. They could
be completely different out here. So,

2120
02:05:20,250 --> 02:05:20,610
you know,

2121
02:05:20,610 --> 02:05:23,670
I mean you can buy like off rogue or
whatever they have the things that you hit

2122
02:05:23,671 --> 02:05:28,110
with the hammers really broken.
So like other than a tire? Yeah,

2123
02:05:28,111 --> 02:05:30,790
they have an actual, so like if you've
ever seen the crossfit games, I,

2124
02:05:30,791 --> 02:05:35,250
they do the, the game, uh, I
dunno. Game, whatever it is.

2125
02:05:35,380 --> 02:05:39,380
It crossfit competition thing. That's
like a big piece of rubber. And then,

2126
02:05:39,381 --> 02:05:42,870
and they have to move it from one side
to the other, like 10 yards or something.

2127
02:05:42,870 --> 02:05:45,700
They have to hit with the hammer,
but their hammer.

2128
02:05:45,701 --> 02:05:48,270
So it's like rogue makes
a ham. Oh, there it is.

2129
02:05:48,330 --> 02:05:52,230
So it's like a big Hong Kong rubber.
Yeah. Yeah. Those are great. And so like,

2130
02:05:52,231 --> 02:05:55,940
rug makes a hammer, right? That's
adjustable weight too. But there's,

2131
02:05:55,950 --> 02:05:59,820
you unbolt it and poor Bibi's into
it. Oh my, this ridiculous. Right?

2132
02:06:01,300 --> 02:06:02,940
Like who's,
who's actually going to do that?

2133
02:06:02,941 --> 02:06:06,060
And they have fucking Bibi's everywhere,
all this kind of shit. So that's why,

2134
02:06:06,061 --> 02:06:09,510
you know, I was like, uh, you know,
I go to west side, I have a fucking,

2135
02:06:09,511 --> 02:06:14,250
Dave Hoff is there 300. Uh, you know,
those strongest man history. I'm like,

2136
02:06:14,280 --> 02:06:18,000
if he's going to swing a hammer, it's
not going to be fucking 16 pound hammer.

2137
02:06:18,001 --> 02:06:20,840
He'll do that with is
one handed. So, you know,

2138
02:06:20,841 --> 02:06:23,980
so I wanted to build something
that anybody could use.
And then the wheelbarrow,

2139
02:06:24,030 --> 02:06:27,110
you know, we had to put
where it can hold. I,

2140
02:06:27,260 --> 02:06:30,430
I've had over a thousand pounds on
it at west side. Jesus, you know,

2141
02:06:30,450 --> 02:06:32,710
I can't lift a thousand pounds on it,
but um,

2142
02:06:32,850 --> 02:06:34,920
we'll put over a thousand pounds on there.
We have different handles.

2143
02:06:34,921 --> 02:06:38,000
So that's what I changed.
So when Louise was just one handled I,

2144
02:06:38,010 --> 02:06:41,390
so we have d handles, right?
So you can grip it like this,
do like a clean pressed.

2145
02:06:41,391 --> 02:06:43,670
And he's like, uh, um, we have, um,

2146
02:06:43,780 --> 02:06:46,680
like turn into like a prowler
said it's got handles coming up,

2147
02:06:46,681 --> 02:06:51,310
things like that and just do laps with
it. You just do laps. I mean, like I said,

2148
02:06:51,311 --> 02:06:55,110
you use like a prowler. You can do
cleans a overhead presses. I mean,

2149
02:06:55,111 --> 02:06:58,200
there's a million different things you
can do with it. So when you're slamming,

2150
02:06:58,500 --> 02:07:01,170
when you do, when the hammer
workout and you're slamming a tire,

2151
02:07:01,171 --> 02:07:05,770
like where are you feeling it most in
your back, your legs, you know? Uh, yeah,

2152
02:07:06,270 --> 02:07:09,220
usually not the leg so
much. Um, you know, the,

2153
02:07:09,221 --> 02:07:12,000
that's more just you just kind
of stabilizing with your legs.

2154
02:07:12,001 --> 02:07:14,670
But a lot of times it depends
on your weakness too, right?

2155
02:07:14,700 --> 02:07:16,590
Some people feel it more
than the shoulders. Um,

2156
02:07:16,620 --> 02:07:19,380
I usually feel it more in
my grip, you know, because,

2157
02:07:19,630 --> 02:07:21,150
but there's a few different
ways you can do it too.

2158
02:07:21,151 --> 02:07:23,070
So like if I want to
feel it more in my grip,

2159
02:07:23,310 --> 02:07:28,080
I'll do a slam where I try to stop
it. Oh, right. So, you know, very,

2160
02:07:28,100 --> 02:07:29,520
at the very end,
as soon as it hits,

2161
02:07:29,521 --> 02:07:32,710
because the tire is going to bounce
it back and I'll try to stop it. Um,

2162
02:07:33,180 --> 02:07:35,370
but a lot of times I feel it
more than the core. Right. Um,

2163
02:07:35,470 --> 02:07:38,740
and then sometimes I do like, you
know, over the head, like this, boom,

2164
02:07:39,310 --> 02:07:41,490
bring it down that way it felt
way more in the core. Yeah.

2165
02:07:41,500 --> 02:07:46,210
We're trying to swing it sideways. Yeah.
I'm not quite as fun on that. I just,

2166
02:07:46,420 --> 02:07:50,470
uh, it gets a little dangerous and I
think he kind of, which I, I personally,

2167
02:07:50,471 --> 02:07:51,191
I would do it.
Like,

2168
02:07:51,191 --> 02:07:53,560
I wouldn't recommend other people do it
unless they've been swinging hammers for

2169
02:07:53,600 --> 02:07:56,120
awhile. I remember, um, um,

2170
02:07:56,290 --> 02:08:00,220
I've just seen people do stupid things.
Now.

2171
02:08:00,221 --> 02:08:03,230
What are the kind of Shit do you do for
strength and conditioning? You name it,

2172
02:08:03,680 --> 02:08:06,610
I suppose to say, you know, I mean we
followed the west side conjugate system,

2173
02:08:06,611 --> 02:08:11,560
so it's really, you know, things
change all the time. Um, I mean,

2174
02:08:11,590 --> 02:08:16,210
you know, it depends on if it's general
specific. So I always add in a third one,

2175
02:08:16,211 --> 02:08:18,820
there's, you know, there's Gpp,
general physical preparation,

2176
02:08:18,821 --> 02:08:21,100
there's SPP which has
specific physical preparation.

2177
02:08:21,430 --> 02:08:24,880
And then I add in personally,
my own was just a RSPP,

2178
02:08:24,881 --> 02:08:26,290
which is what I call like the hammers.

2179
02:08:26,710 --> 02:08:29,590
Like the wheel Barrow would be
more the war, I would call it.

2180
02:08:29,591 --> 02:08:33,580
The war wagon is more a general, right.
So it's just gonna build general strength,

2181
02:08:33,581 --> 02:08:35,770
you know, he's going to bring your
endurance up, your max capacity up,

2182
02:08:35,771 --> 02:08:40,570
things like that. The, uh, you know,
getting on the mats and you know,

2183
02:08:40,660 --> 02:08:44,510
doing 20 double legs, that's SPP
like very specific, right. Um,

2184
02:08:44,620 --> 02:08:49,430
the something like a hammer or maybe
a lot of a band type stuff. Uh,

2185
02:08:49,600 --> 02:08:51,890
like maybe shooting double legs
with the band on or something.

2186
02:08:51,891 --> 02:08:56,800
And I call that RSVP, which is
replicated specific physical preparation.

2187
02:08:56,801 --> 02:09:01,000
Some, you know, I could break down all
three of these and just go on forever.

2188
02:09:01,001 --> 02:09:02,860
I mean with,
when you're in the GPP,

2189
02:09:02,861 --> 02:09:05,200
you're going to get him like
build up your Max capacity,

2190
02:09:05,201 --> 02:09:08,300
you're going to build up your strength,
you want to build up your bone density,

2191
02:09:08,301 --> 02:09:12,430
your ligament strength, your
tendon strength. You have,
of course, I, any weaknesses?

2192
02:09:12,431 --> 02:09:15,750
Uh, I'm big on the neck, back
and posterior chain, right? The,

2193
02:09:15,760 --> 02:09:19,110
they say the fronts for show
the backs for go. So who are,

2194
02:09:19,120 --> 02:09:22,840
who have used the iron neck. Oh yeah. Yup.
We use it all the time. I love that. Fun.

2195
02:09:22,841 --> 02:09:26,550
Yeah. I love that thing. Nothing
amazing. Genius invention. I know, right?

2196
02:09:26,620 --> 02:09:30,530
I think it's really uncomfortable, but
yeah, I got one of those out here. Yeah.

2197
02:09:30,970 --> 02:09:33,910
I say I like it. I don't like, I
want it at home too. To be honest.

2198
02:09:33,950 --> 02:09:38,550
I think clinching does more than
anything else, man. For, for neck.

2199
02:09:38,660 --> 02:09:42,290
Like my neck just gets more sore doing
that than anything else. Oh sure. Yeah.

2200
02:09:42,340 --> 02:09:47,150
Yeah. So that's uh,
using, uh, my, my friends,

2201
02:09:47,151 --> 02:09:51,640
uh, at west side they do a
lot where they'll put a band
on the war wagon and then

2202
02:09:51,641 --> 02:09:55,230
carry it at the same time. Oh Wow.
It's pulling the neck while you're,

2203
02:09:55,900 --> 02:09:59,350
and you have to walk. So psych of
very dynamic workout at the same time.

2204
02:09:59,351 --> 02:10:01,160
So your grips given out your trap,

2205
02:10:01,161 --> 02:10:03,580
start giving out what kind of harness
or they're putting on their head.

2206
02:10:03,740 --> 02:10:08,680
Just like a, you know the leathers.
Yeah. Right, right. Yeah. And uh,

2207
02:10:08,710 --> 02:10:08,891
you know,

2208
02:10:08,891 --> 02:10:13,330
just to with the chain and then band
and say you're having to hold this while

2209
02:10:13,331 --> 02:10:15,250
you're walking.
It makes it much more dynamic.

2210
02:10:15,251 --> 02:10:18,440
So I liked that they come up
with some crazy shit there. Yeah.

2211
02:10:18,670 --> 02:10:21,370
Well that's where I'll go to
the iron neck, Instagram page.

2212
02:10:21,371 --> 02:10:25,180
They do a lot of crazy shit with the
iron neck on like a lot of medicine ball

2213
02:10:25,181 --> 02:10:27,490
shit, a lot of slams.
While you're, you know,

2214
02:10:27,491 --> 02:10:31,750
you're pulled back so you're on the
full full, uh, resistance with the band.

2215
02:10:31,900 --> 02:10:34,660
You're moving your head and you're
slamming the ball, the right.

2216
02:10:34,660 --> 02:10:36,950
And the last things on those
lines to check that out.

2217
02:10:36,951 --> 02:10:40,760
I've never tried out their Instagram
[inaudible] Instagram personally,

2218
02:10:40,761 --> 02:10:42,800
but why do you do that man?

2219
02:10:42,801 --> 02:10:45,820
For one Instagram to me is the
most mindless thing in the world.

2220
02:10:45,830 --> 02:10:48,830
Perhaps looking at pictures,
pictures and,

2221
02:10:50,050 --> 02:10:54,280
and half the time you don't even read the,
uh,

2222
02:10:54,650 --> 02:10:57,640
breakdown the captions.
Yeah. Um, so to me it's,

2223
02:10:57,641 --> 02:11:02,360
it's really social media is
first off is pretty dumbed down,

2224
02:11:02,361 --> 02:11:03,530
like read a fucking book,
right?

2225
02:11:03,770 --> 02:11:06,920
And then now you have something
that is not even a, you know,

2226
02:11:07,170 --> 02:11:09,700
been riding like it was just
pictures, like, you know, like the,

2227
02:11:10,160 --> 02:11:12,380
the people that are like, no, it
was a book. Every pictures, well,

2228
02:11:12,381 --> 02:11:16,880
I'm not going to read it or something,
you know. So to me, and I also,

2229
02:11:17,220 --> 02:11:19,200
I'm a big believer that a,
um,

2230
02:11:19,670 --> 02:11:23,870
and you know what goes in your brain
and your mind, what you let in,

2231
02:11:23,871 --> 02:11:25,220
it needs to be very controlled.

2232
02:11:25,580 --> 02:11:29,870
You need to be very specific and
careful about what you let in.

2233
02:11:30,140 --> 02:11:32,030
And you never know what you're
going to come across on there.

2234
02:11:32,031 --> 02:11:35,640
So it can be something toxic
that can be bad, right.

2235
02:11:36,340 --> 02:11:39,560
Especially if you're reading
comments. Right? Absolutely.
Yeah. It gets way worse.

2236
02:11:39,890 --> 02:11:43,880
Which, and you know, I used
it, uh, I mean I'm on there a
lot, but you know, I use it.

2237
02:11:43,910 --> 02:11:48,560
Uh, I like to, um, I remember back in
the day when I was, uh, coming up and,

2238
02:11:49,300 --> 02:11:53,780
um, you know, I would dream
of talking to a UFC fighter.

2239
02:11:54,460 --> 02:11:56,420
So I use it to interact with my fans,
right.

2240
02:11:56,870 --> 02:11:59,810
Cause I want to give some
kids that experience.

2241
02:12:00,290 --> 02:12:03,560
I think it's a very powerful
tool for that. Oh yeah. That's,

2242
02:12:03,561 --> 02:12:06,470
that's a powerful thing for a
young guy coming up, you know,

2243
02:12:06,471 --> 02:12:09,770
to be able to talk to Matt Brown and
you actually respond to them and say,

2244
02:12:09,771 --> 02:12:12,110
good luck. You're like,
Holy Shit. Yeah. I mean,

2245
02:12:12,650 --> 02:12:16,240
I probably do it maybe even more
than I should. Like I mean I,

2246
02:12:16,930 --> 02:12:20,000
I answered like complete
question sometimes. You
know, like people ask me the,

2247
02:12:20,210 --> 02:12:23,020
the wildest questions, you
know, and um, I like, I'll,

2248
02:12:23,030 --> 02:12:24,670
I'll give him complete responses,
but,

2249
02:12:24,810 --> 02:12:28,850
and I find that 90% of the time they're
like, oh cool man, glad you responded.

2250
02:12:29,300 --> 02:12:32,570
And then they forget about it most
likely. Right. And then, but you know,

2251
02:12:32,571 --> 02:12:35,430
if I can touch just a few people,
men, I mean that's really what the,

2252
02:12:35,720 --> 02:12:39,710
the whole thing's about. Do you have a
youtube channel? No, but I probably will.

2253
02:12:39,890 --> 02:12:42,820
That's maybe a good move for you
because you've got so much information.

2254
02:12:42,840 --> 02:12:45,500
Your head like just talking
to you before the podcast,

2255
02:12:45,501 --> 02:12:48,740
you're rattling off these different
training modalities and different recovery

2256
02:12:48,741 --> 02:12:50,900
methods and techniques and shit like that.
I was like,

2257
02:12:51,330 --> 02:12:54,200
my Brown's got a lot of information
in his head. Yeah. I'm not dumb.

2258
02:12:54,201 --> 02:12:58,340
I might be a savage, but
I mean, getting help,

2259
02:12:58,470 --> 02:13:01,490
people think those things are mutually
exclusive. Absolutely. You know,

2260
02:13:01,491 --> 02:13:04,250
like if you're, if you're a savage,
you've got gotta be stupid. Absolutely.

2261
02:13:04,310 --> 02:13:08,560
And my thing is my savage newness,

2262
02:13:08,600 --> 02:13:12,710
I approach all things with that
savage intent. Right? So when I,

2263
02:13:13,880 --> 02:13:17,810
like if I'm into a book,
like I'm reading a bad ass book right now.

2264
02:13:18,170 --> 02:13:21,980
And what is antifragile what does that,
um,

2265
02:13:22,400 --> 02:13:26,030
I'm trying to remember the name of the
author, but it's on my kindle. And, uh,

2266
02:13:26,810 --> 02:13:30,740
so if you think of the,
the, there's no term,

2267
02:13:30,770 --> 02:13:34,770
there's no definition of
fragility are antifragile right.

2268
02:13:34,771 --> 02:13:38,040
So he came up with this term,
he wrote the book,

2269
02:13:38,190 --> 02:13:42,900
the Black Swan also and
Nassim Nicholas. Yeah. Oh,

2270
02:13:42,901 --> 02:13:47,220
I've heard of that guy. He has a very
interesting way of writing. And uh,

2271
02:13:48,010 --> 02:13:53,010
so he really digs deep into this
concept of antifragility where, um,

2272
02:13:53,070 --> 02:13:58,070
it's not necessarily
robustness or things like is

2273
02:13:59,910 --> 02:14:02,820
God, I hate it because I try to
reexplain it cause I butcher shit.

2274
02:14:02,850 --> 02:14:06,120
I feel like I don't give it
justice, but, um, you know,

2275
02:14:06,121 --> 02:14:09,000
I'm only like halfway through the book,
but like I said, I've really attacked it,

2276
02:14:09,001 --> 02:14:13,500
like with that savage sort of a
mindset. Right. But, um, it's a very,

2277
02:14:13,501 --> 02:14:18,420
very long book. Well, it's basically,
you know, like, like our, um, you know,

2278
02:14:18,421 --> 02:14:23,220
he makes the case that a
fragility is, you know, good.

2279
02:14:23,221 --> 02:14:23,461
Right.

2280
02:14:23,461 --> 02:14:28,461
And it creates antifragility he makes
the case a antifragility is good.

2281
02:14:29,910 --> 02:14:33,900
Right. And not necessarily, like I say,
I feel like I'm just butchering it, man.

2282
02:14:33,901 --> 02:14:38,350
Just read the book fucking, but when he
says about, when you're saying fragility,

2283
02:14:38,370 --> 02:14:41,830
do you mean for agility in terms
of your mindset? In terms of just,

2284
02:14:41,850 --> 02:14:46,410
it turns out he's an economic
guy, so he's really, I think he,

2285
02:14:46,680 --> 02:14:49,140
I think what he's getting at get them
only half, like halfway through the book.

2286
02:14:49,141 --> 02:14:53,130
But I think really what he's getting at
is more economic and political is kind

2287
02:14:53,131 --> 02:14:57,260
of his a longterm thing. But he uses
a lot of examples. So it basically,

2288
02:14:57,261 --> 02:14:59,640
it what I've gathered so far,

2289
02:14:59,641 --> 02:15:04,350
it's basically like how stress
induces a stress response, which,

2290
02:15:04,640 --> 02:15:09,030
which induces strength and which is
the closest thing I would say is to

2291
02:15:09,031 --> 02:15:10,460
antifragility a strength.
Right.

2292
02:15:10,830 --> 02:15:15,660
And how anti fragility would
make the world a better place,

2293
02:15:15,661 --> 02:15:20,040
more or less and towards as a response
to stress, let's look training.

2294
02:15:20,180 --> 02:15:23,310
Exactly. Yeah. And, I mean, he even
uses that example, you know, how,

2295
02:15:23,400 --> 02:15:26,670
how we tear muscles down to build them
up. That's our entire purpose. Yeah.

2296
02:15:26,970 --> 02:15:31,950
So that's, um, again, I'm only
halfway through it, man. I,
I don't want to butcher it,

2297
02:15:32,670 --> 02:15:37,260
so fucking great book. But like I
said, I, I mean it's a long, long,

2298
02:15:37,650 --> 02:15:39,570
very long book and it's sort of,
uh,

2299
02:15:40,140 --> 02:15:42,750
he kind of digs into all these
different subjects on it,

2300
02:15:43,050 --> 02:15:46,710
even though it's really like he could
probably sum it up in about a quarter of

2301
02:15:46,711 --> 02:15:49,890
the book, but, you know, I would just say
to you, I just attack it like that, man.

2302
02:15:49,890 --> 02:15:54,660
I just, you know, um, like prince to super
training you, you know this book, right?

2303
02:15:54,720 --> 02:15:58,560
I've heard of it. I haven't read
it though. Well, it's the most,

2304
02:15:59,550 --> 02:16:03,300
probably the most difficult to read
book I've ever read and I've read it

2305
02:16:03,301 --> 02:16:08,010
probably four or five times now. What's so
difficult about it? Um, it's just ultra,

2306
02:16:08,011 --> 02:16:11,670
ultra scientific and it's
written by Mel siff and, um,

2307
02:16:11,850 --> 02:16:15,130
Burger Shamsky who was the
inventor of plyometrics. So the,

2308
02:16:15,320 --> 02:16:20,160
the fountain plyometrics and the Russians
and I'm Mel Siff is a biomechanical

2309
02:16:20,161 --> 02:16:23,550
engineer and the two of them
came together. And you know,

2310
02:16:23,551 --> 02:16:28,450
there's super training is basically
like the Bible of, um, of string,

2311
02:16:28,451 --> 02:16:29,950
the conditioning books
altogether, right? It's,

2312
02:16:30,130 --> 02:16:32,680
it's the original straight
that conditioning. But, um,

2313
02:16:32,681 --> 02:16:35,560
I mean there's also like science
and practice of strength training.

2314
02:16:35,561 --> 02:16:38,800
There's a science of sports training.
There's a lot of really good books,

2315
02:16:38,830 --> 02:16:43,150
but super training is like that,
just the pioneer, the premier book.

2316
02:16:43,600 --> 02:16:48,330
And it's all very, very scientific.
And a lot of the times, man,

2317
02:16:48,331 --> 02:16:51,250
I'll have to read the same paragraph
like four times, you know? And I've,

2318
02:16:51,251 --> 02:16:54,330
I've read the book like four times then,
and I still,

2319
02:16:54,340 --> 02:16:58,000
I'm going through the paragraph like, what
the fuck man, what is he talking about?

2320
02:16:58,001 --> 02:17:02,170
The son of a bitch. So anyway, so like
the, you know, the point, he's like,

2321
02:17:02,171 --> 02:17:07,150
I just attack it like that, you know?
And um, um, I think there's other things.

2322
02:17:07,180 --> 02:17:11,530
I think a lot of people, um, again, like
it's all about inspiring others, right?

2323
02:17:11,531 --> 02:17:13,450
And I think a lot of people
could learn a lot from that.

2324
02:17:13,750 --> 02:17:16,450
And that's what I tried doing my fights.
I try to inspire people.

2325
02:17:16,451 --> 02:17:17,860
I want my kids to be that way.

2326
02:17:17,861 --> 02:17:21,610
I Wa I wa I think it could bring
the world up that way, man.

2327
02:17:21,611 --> 02:17:24,710
People find something they want and
it's actually like a goddamn salad.

2328
02:17:25,630 --> 02:17:28,540
Well, when people see someone
that does really go for it,

2329
02:17:28,570 --> 02:17:30,460
it doesn't inspire them to go for it too.

2330
02:17:30,490 --> 02:17:33,280
They see the excitement in it and they
see the response that other people have

2331
02:17:33,281 --> 02:17:35,260
to that excitement.
And it just,

2332
02:17:35,261 --> 02:17:38,250
it just makes them want to up
their own life performance and,

2333
02:17:38,251 --> 02:17:41,440
and a lot of various ways, you
know, not just a in fighting,

2334
02:17:41,441 --> 02:17:45,040
but they might want to
up their performance from
watching you fight in whatever

2335
02:17:45,041 --> 02:17:45,874
the fuck they're doing.

2336
02:17:46,920 --> 02:17:49,470
And that's, to me, that means
more than anything else.

2337
02:17:50,010 --> 02:17:52,860
That's what a lot of people talk about,
the meaning of life.

2338
02:17:52,861 --> 02:17:54,300
I gotta think I gotta figure it out.
I mean,

2339
02:17:54,301 --> 02:17:58,230
I think the meaning of life is to give.
I think that's, if you look in in nature,

2340
02:17:58,231 --> 02:17:59,340
I know you're a big nature buff.

2341
02:17:59,341 --> 02:18:03,390
I mean that's what everything exists
in nature to do. That's what a,

2342
02:18:03,391 --> 02:18:06,780
that's what a tree grows fruit to
give more fruit, right? That there's,

2343
02:18:07,170 --> 02:18:11,790
this is the,
a natural process of the world and humans,

2344
02:18:12,540 --> 02:18:17,190
the human animal has become, uh,
to analytical to figure that out.

2345
02:18:17,550 --> 02:18:17,821
Right?

2346
02:18:17,821 --> 02:18:21,510
We think the meaning of life is all
these other things because we think about

2347
02:18:21,511 --> 02:18:25,980
other things, but really our,
our entire purpose is to give,

2348
02:18:27,290 --> 02:18:28,123
hmm.

2349
02:18:28,640 --> 02:18:30,410
I think there's a lot of purposes in life,

2350
02:18:30,411 --> 02:18:33,770
but I think that is one of them for sure.
I think giving is definitely,

2351
02:18:33,980 --> 02:18:38,690
it gives you a sense of meaning.
And when you help other people,

2352
02:18:38,691 --> 02:18:40,190
you feel better.
You know,

2353
02:18:40,191 --> 02:18:42,140
that's one thing that I think
people are missing out on.

2354
02:18:42,141 --> 02:18:45,710
They think that it should be all about
themselves and I'm just about succeeding

2355
02:18:45,711 --> 02:18:46,760
and getting by on my own.

2356
02:18:47,200 --> 02:18:49,240
Well, even what you
just said, uh, you know,

2357
02:18:49,250 --> 02:18:52,690
gives you a sense of meaning
or makes you feel better. Yeah.

2358
02:18:52,760 --> 02:18:55,130
So you bought it back to yourself.
Right. Right. And that's,

2359
02:18:55,360 --> 02:18:59,640
that's what I had to think as human
nature and that's easy. But, um,

2360
02:18:59,740 --> 02:19:02,860
I tried to get past that where,
where it's not about me,

2361
02:19:02,861 --> 02:19:06,960
it's not about how I feel about
it. So it's about just giving, um,

2362
02:19:07,950 --> 02:19:11,830
um, completely selfless. That's
a great way to look at it.

2363
02:19:11,860 --> 02:19:13,360
The way I described it that way though,

2364
02:19:13,361 --> 02:19:17,880
is to enlightened people to
this idea that I think Peter,

2365
02:19:17,890 --> 02:19:18,581
not nonlying people,

2366
02:19:18,581 --> 02:19:23,581
but I just express my own perspective
that I think people spend too much time

2367
02:19:25,000 --> 02:19:30,000
thinking about what benefits them and
that they don't recognize that the more

2368
02:19:32,031 --> 02:19:35,540
you benefit other people,
that is really what benefits,

2369
02:19:35,541 --> 02:19:37,850
not just those other people,
but you as well.

2370
02:19:38,300 --> 02:19:40,730
And that they think of like
helping people. Like, yeah,

2371
02:19:40,731 --> 02:19:41,600
it'd be good to help people,

2372
02:19:41,601 --> 02:19:45,500
but that's going to fuck me up because
then I'm going to spend less time on my

2373
02:19:45,501 --> 02:19:48,080
own self.
But it's not really the case.

2374
02:19:48,200 --> 02:19:51,530
You actually enhance your own
experience in life by hello

2375
02:19:51,590 --> 02:19:54,410
being other people, as we were talking
about before the podcast has, right.

2376
02:19:54,411 --> 02:19:59,240
The abundance mentality. And that is,
uh, specifically the abundance mentality.

2377
02:19:59,440 --> 02:20:00,300
Yeah, no, I'm,

2378
02:20:00,301 --> 02:20:05,301
I'm a gigantic believer in generosity
and abundance mentality and I'm,

2379
02:20:06,580 --> 02:20:07,000
I,

2380
02:20:07,000 --> 02:20:11,650
I'm a fucking ferocious
opponent of famine thinking.

2381
02:20:12,010 --> 02:20:16,930
I think that famine mentality, if fucks
people up so hard, you get closed up,

2382
02:20:17,200 --> 02:20:19,840
you get, you know, Pr, ultra
protective, you get ultra.

2383
02:20:20,110 --> 02:20:23,680
I just think that's a terrible way to
live your life and you're living your life

2384
02:20:23,681 --> 02:20:24,514
with fear.

2385
02:20:24,650 --> 02:20:29,010
The hard part is implementing it, right?
Like I can see her talk about it all day.

2386
02:20:29,011 --> 02:20:32,280
Like I don't give enough to, you know
what I mean? I don't give enough away.

2387
02:20:32,370 --> 02:20:34,320
That's for sure.
I've thought about,

2388
02:20:34,321 --> 02:20:38,280
sometimes I think about the crazy
shit sometimes and I was like,

2389
02:20:38,790 --> 02:20:42,680
I think the ultimate like coolest
thing in life. So I have to have money.

2390
02:20:42,681 --> 02:20:47,340
He's like for my kids,
unfortunately. Right. Not
Unfortunate but necessity. Yeah.

2391
02:20:47,350 --> 02:20:49,650
Necessity.
That's what the money is about.

2392
02:20:49,860 --> 02:20:54,240
I feel like if I didn't have kids I would
just give literally every dime away,

2393
02:20:54,241 --> 02:20:58,200
start from bottom and see how many times.
Cause you know, so there's like certain

2394
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:03,000
qualities in people that they are
going to succeed no matter what. Right.

2395
02:21:03,410 --> 02:21:05,730
And I want to see like if I
have those qualities right.

2396
02:21:05,731 --> 02:21:09,270
So I want to give everything away.
Start that right now. You definitely do.

2397
02:21:10,230 --> 02:21:11,730
Listen man,
you can do whatever the fuck

2398
02:21:11,760 --> 02:21:16,350
you want in this life. But I feel
like a guy like you in particular,

2399
02:21:16,351 --> 02:21:18,990
especially right now when you're on this,
uh,

2400
02:21:19,020 --> 02:21:21,930
this fighting journey
and you're still on it,

2401
02:21:22,710 --> 02:21:27,300
I think what you give the most is through
the best possible performance that you

2402
02:21:27,301 --> 02:21:29,640
give.
And when you have these wild,

2403
02:21:29,641 --> 02:21:32,040
crazy performances like
the Diego Sanchez fight,

2404
02:21:32,370 --> 02:21:34,170
that shit inspires the fuck out of people.
I mean,

2405
02:21:34,171 --> 02:21:35,640
how many people watched that fight and,

2406
02:21:36,090 --> 02:21:39,630
and just wanted to go run mountains
and just get crazy. It's just

2407
02:21:39,980 --> 02:21:41,720
man, as, as cool you bring
that up. Cause I mean,

2408
02:21:41,721 --> 02:21:44,920
I never even thought of it that way.
Like I always see it again,

2409
02:21:44,930 --> 02:21:48,500
I always bring it back to myself and I
see it as an expression of my own art.

2410
02:21:48,710 --> 02:21:50,120
You're upon myself for the year,

2411
02:21:51,040 --> 02:21:53,110
not just an athlete.
You're not just a fighter,

2412
02:21:53,111 --> 02:21:56,620
but you're also a public performer
and an inspirational figure.

2413
02:21:56,890 --> 02:22:01,630
And when you are doing your best,
that gives a lot to people. I mean,

2414
02:22:02,170 --> 02:22:06,520
how many people have watched
great athletic performances
and it's given them the

2415
02:22:06,521 --> 02:22:09,460
fuel and the inspiration and do
great things in their own life.

2416
02:22:09,730 --> 02:22:12,610
That SQL, he said, yeah cause a man,

2417
02:22:12,611 --> 02:22:15,500
I might inspire me to fight
it a little longer. You know,

2418
02:22:16,210 --> 02:22:19,090
you weren't ready to
retire after Diego fight.

2419
02:22:19,091 --> 02:22:23,950
That was supposed to be your swan song.
What was it just too sweet? No, no, no,

2420
02:22:23,951 --> 02:22:27,840
it wasn't, it had nothing do with the
performance actually, uh, this year.

2421
02:22:27,841 --> 02:22:29,370
So I think when we started the podcast,

2422
02:22:29,460 --> 02:22:31,920
I was talking about the why in
the house a little bit. Right.

2423
02:22:31,921 --> 02:22:35,460
And this is where I think I got
a little confused was I, I think,

2424
02:22:36,420 --> 02:22:38,550
um, I mean for one, I, I was,

2425
02:22:38,610 --> 02:22:41,880
I was questioning a lot of things that
got knocked out by cowboy viciously.

2426
02:22:42,120 --> 02:22:45,390
I'm the worst. Not, I've never been
knocked out of my life. I mean,

2427
02:22:45,690 --> 02:22:49,510
and it wasn't too long after I just
got dropped hard by Ellenberger,

2428
02:22:49,560 --> 02:22:52,780
which was the first time my life had ever
been dropped in sparring or anything.

2429
02:22:52,780 --> 02:22:57,750
I never been dropped. Um, so I started
just kind of questioning, you know,

2430
02:22:57,751 --> 02:22:59,700
what, uh, what am I doing? Okay, well how,

2431
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:04,710
and the first thing I went to was how
do I not make that happen again? Um,

2432
02:23:05,190 --> 02:23:09,600
so that gets very exhausting when
you just like how, how, how, right.

2433
02:23:10,020 --> 02:23:14,300
And I think through the Diego
camp, cause I, you know,

2434
02:23:14,310 --> 02:23:17,130
I announced her retirement long,
you know, very early in the camp,

2435
02:23:17,131 --> 02:23:20,920
like 12 weeks out or something like
that through the camp at men. Uh,

2436
02:23:21,150 --> 02:23:25,440
everything went so well. I, I, I
focused more on my own mind and,

2437
02:23:25,441 --> 02:23:28,000
and a lot of these things we're
talking about. And I started, uh,

2438
02:23:28,020 --> 02:23:30,720
getting back into the y and I started,
uh,

2439
02:23:30,750 --> 02:23:33,090
bringing a lot more clarity
to that side of things.

2440
02:23:33,330 --> 02:23:35,040
Now I know why I'm doing what I'm doing.

2441
02:23:35,041 --> 02:23:39,480
I feel much more comfortable and now
it doesn't matter on the performance

2442
02:23:39,481 --> 02:23:43,350
anymore. Now it's about truly going out
there and performing the best that I can.

2443
02:23:43,680 --> 02:23:47,540
And then the second part of the
whole thing is a, um, you know,

2444
02:23:47,550 --> 02:23:49,860
I was very scared of retirement.
I was very,

2445
02:23:50,130 --> 02:23:54,090
very nervous to be thinking like,
what am I going to do? You know,

2446
02:23:54,091 --> 02:23:58,490
like how am I gonna feed my
kids? And, um, fortunately, um,

2447
02:23:58,920 --> 02:24:00,450
you know, I, I was able to,

2448
02:24:00,451 --> 02:24:03,720
I realized once I announced it
and then after the fight, I mean,

2449
02:24:03,770 --> 02:24:06,030
it just a plethora of, uh, of, of,

2450
02:24:06,031 --> 02:24:09,870
of opportunities and a Mussel farms
probably been my best opportunity.

2451
02:24:09,871 --> 02:24:13,170
And that's why, um, you know, I,
I bring them up a lot, you know,

2452
02:24:13,171 --> 02:24:14,940
because they've helped me so much and,

2453
02:24:15,300 --> 02:24:19,230
and I think we're going to do amazing
things there, whether I retire or not.

2454
02:24:19,620 --> 02:24:22,560
And I think it's going to be
a big, beautiful thing. Um,

2455
02:24:22,561 --> 02:24:26,840
what do you do for them specifically?
Um, so I'm kind of tasked with, uh,

2456
02:24:27,030 --> 02:24:31,290
building the fight team and bringing,
um,

2457
02:24:31,560 --> 02:24:35,730
the athletes and, and communicating
with athletes and, um,

2458
02:24:37,020 --> 02:24:41,030
you know, just making it
a solid program there. Um,

2459
02:24:41,220 --> 02:24:44,130
whether I'm the coach or not, it
doesn't even matter. But, you know,

2460
02:24:44,131 --> 02:24:47,540
I want to make a, a great program
and make sure that, you know,

2461
02:24:47,590 --> 02:24:51,250
the facilities being used properly and
bring in different athletes. And, um,

2462
02:24:51,510 --> 02:24:54,900
that'd be kind of the first step.
And then beyond that, I mean,

2463
02:24:54,901 --> 02:24:57,450
the opportunities are endless. I can
do a lot of different things with it.

2464
02:24:57,600 --> 02:25:02,010
So what was the thought process that was
it immediately after the Diego Sanchez

2465
02:25:02,011 --> 02:25:04,800
fight? Cause I talked to
you in Denver, um, when,

2466
02:25:04,920 --> 02:25:07,050
when you came to my show at the Belko,
I called you up,

2467
02:25:07,051 --> 02:25:10,530
we were talking and you said, I'm, I
really sure I'm done. And I was like,

2468
02:25:10,531 --> 02:25:13,860
what's going on? That, so I don't
remember the exact date of that,

2469
02:25:13,861 --> 02:25:17,670
but that was probably, you
know, um, you know, I said
the retirement and then again,

2470
02:25:17,671 --> 02:25:22,170
like the camp just started going amazing.
And again, the why came back, man.

2471
02:25:22,171 --> 02:25:24,160
Like I knew why I was
doing what I was doing.

2472
02:25:24,161 --> 02:25:27,490
Like I was enjoying my time at the
gym again. Aren't you enjoying it?

2473
02:25:28,750 --> 02:25:33,090
Um, I, there's been a lot of times, I
mean, what do you think you, you know,

2474
02:25:33,091 --> 02:25:33,924
my man,

2475
02:25:33,940 --> 02:25:38,940
I've been around and I've had a lot
of different coaches and that's my,

2476
02:25:39,430 --> 02:25:40,270
that's my biggest,

2477
02:25:40,271 --> 02:25:45,271
if I had a regret in my career and said
I wasn't as loyal to one sort of system

2478
02:25:46,180 --> 02:25:48,970
as I should've been, I, and
I have a term for it now,

2479
02:25:48,971 --> 02:25:52,570
I call it the Unicorn Fallacy where
you're constantly chasing the Unicorn that

2480
02:25:52,571 --> 02:25:54,970
doesn't exist. Right? Or some people,

2481
02:25:54,971 --> 02:25:57,700
I've heard other people call it like
the greener grass syndrome, you know,

2482
02:25:57,701 --> 02:26:00,790
the grass isn't always greener on the
other side. Right. Um, and that would,

2483
02:26:00,791 --> 02:26:04,360
if I had a complaint about myself
or if you want to call it a regret,

2484
02:26:04,361 --> 02:26:06,880
like that's my problem. I'm
always like, dude, I just,

2485
02:26:06,910 --> 02:26:08,260
I just need to go over
here and I'll get better.

2486
02:26:08,261 --> 02:26:12,400
Cause I'm always searching that how
right. Not Forgot the Y. So, um,

2487
02:26:13,750 --> 02:26:15,970
you know, so again, you know, uh, this is,

2488
02:26:16,540 --> 02:26:21,370
I think a lot of fighters probably also
go through this where, where, I mean,

2489
02:26:21,371 --> 02:26:23,680
it's hard, but we do, and there's
a lot of pressure on her shoulders.

2490
02:26:23,681 --> 02:26:27,880
There's a lot of, um, um,
especially with a family,

2491
02:26:27,881 --> 02:26:30,240
I've got three kids, you
know, and it's like, I mean,

2492
02:26:30,280 --> 02:26:33,310
I got knocked out in front of my three
kids, like they were at the fight,

2493
02:26:33,311 --> 02:26:36,160
you know what I mean? Like I
had a, uh, I think they were,

2494
02:26:36,760 --> 02:26:39,910
I don't even remember because I was
fucking knocked out, you know, like,

2495
02:26:40,300 --> 02:26:43,070
like I don't remember anything until I
was waking up with the hospital, you know,

2496
02:26:43,071 --> 02:26:46,780
and Dwayne to sitting there, you know what
I mean? So like, I mean, looking back,

2497
02:26:46,781 --> 02:26:48,920
like I don't even remember
all this stuff. And, uh,

2498
02:26:50,290 --> 02:26:52,310
it's funny because I've seen videos like,
you know,

2499
02:26:52,430 --> 02:26:55,530
raising cowboys and I was like, I don't
even remember seeing that. Like, uh,

2500
02:26:55,750 --> 02:26:57,070
somebody told me that,
you know,

2501
02:26:57,071 --> 02:26:59,900
we were talking backstage and I seen a
video I should say, of is talking about,

2502
02:26:59,901 --> 02:27:03,070
I said, I don't remember none. Right.
So things like that. Uh, you know,

2503
02:27:03,071 --> 02:27:05,880
it makes you start questioning like,
dude, it's like, cause this shit worth it,

2504
02:27:05,881 --> 02:27:10,720
you know? I mean, um, you know, and
just a lot of internal struggles.

2505
02:27:10,720 --> 02:27:13,430
Right. Um, and again, you know, the,

2506
02:27:13,490 --> 02:27:16,510
the camp I had with Diego and everything,

2507
02:27:16,511 --> 02:27:18,580
just all the pieces fell into
place and it was like, dude,

2508
02:27:18,581 --> 02:27:19,780
if I can do this every time,

2509
02:27:19,781 --> 02:27:22,840
like I could do this for a long time
and I could smash a lot of people.

2510
02:27:23,620 --> 02:27:26,320
So that's where you're at right now.
Yeah. So you were reinvigorated.

2511
02:27:26,350 --> 02:27:30,160
Reinvigorated. That's
interesting. So this long career,

2512
02:27:30,161 --> 02:27:33,340
so many great fights and you still,
you still look fine.

2513
02:27:34,180 --> 02:27:38,140
I think I'm fucking hungry
than ever was man. I was like,

2514
02:27:39,400 --> 02:27:42,970
because of like a lot of stuff we're
talking about today is just wasn't clear.

2515
02:27:42,971 --> 02:27:46,510
You know what I mean? It was just
a, a scatterbrain like again,

2516
02:27:46,511 --> 02:27:47,650
it was all about the how.

2517
02:27:48,840 --> 02:27:52,930
I think I was like a kind of hyper focused
on that. Like how do I get stronger?

2518
02:27:52,931 --> 02:27:55,900
How do I get faster?
How do I throw a better punch?

2519
02:27:55,901 --> 02:27:59,850
How do I analyze this guy? And
how do I beat him? And you know,

2520
02:27:59,950 --> 02:28:03,340
it was just constant out and
then you forget like, why
are you doing this anyway,

2521
02:28:03,850 --> 02:28:07,600
you know, some, and then, I
mean, like I said, it's just a,

2522
02:28:07,840 --> 02:28:11,970
it's not an easy sport anyway.
I mean, this is probably
the hardest sport existed.

2523
02:28:12,620 --> 02:28:15,090
I don't think there's anything
harder. Yeah. I would,

2524
02:28:15,130 --> 02:28:19,750
I can't imagine what's harder other than
the actual war. Yeah, right. I mean,

2525
02:28:19,751 --> 02:28:22,070
maybe police officer, fireman, actual

2526
02:28:22,070 --> 02:28:26,840
war, uh, fucking trauma surgeon.
Even then, I mean, I mean,

2527
02:28:26,841 --> 02:28:29,870
it's harder in different ways.
Harder in different ways. Yeah. Yeah.

2528
02:28:29,871 --> 02:28:34,871
It's one of the most pressure filled
athletic opportunities that a person can

2529
02:28:35,721 --> 02:28:40,010
ever be involved in. And now, sorry, go
ahead. Let's just say, you know, the,

2530
02:28:40,011 --> 02:28:44,780
the hard thing is, uh, this is all I've
done. I've, I've, I got, I'm all in,

2531
02:28:44,810 --> 02:28:46,910
you know, from the beginning
I never gave myself an out.

2532
02:28:47,120 --> 02:28:50,720
And I think that's important to do. Also.
Um, a lot of the guys that have outs,

2533
02:28:50,721 --> 02:28:53,510
I mean I watch shark tank all the time
and you see, you know, these guys,

2534
02:28:53,530 --> 02:28:57,050
if they have an out then the, you know,
Kevin O'leary or whatever it is. I like,

2535
02:28:57,051 --> 02:28:57,711
you know,
fuck you.

2536
02:28:57,711 --> 02:29:02,711
I'm not rich kids don't grow up to be
world championship fighters except for Bj

2537
02:29:02,780 --> 02:29:06,260
Penn. Yeah, he's just a fucking animal.

2538
02:29:06,260 --> 02:29:09,860
But he grew up in Hawaii.
Hawaii. Is it different place?

2539
02:29:09,861 --> 02:29:12,410
Like you're stuck on an island with a
bunch of motherfuckers want to kick your

2540
02:29:12,411 --> 02:29:17,411
ass like it's do or die and why he is
a under appreciated place for tough

2541
02:29:19,070 --> 02:29:21,730
motherfuckers. You know, I'll have
to go there. My wife once again,

2542
02:29:21,770 --> 02:29:24,500
never been there once I lived there,

2543
02:29:24,620 --> 02:29:27,730
I was in like Waikiki the whole time
that I live on the big island. Yeah.

2544
02:29:27,770 --> 02:29:31,590
Fuck yeah. I could live there.
Yeah, you would get an island.

2545
02:29:31,610 --> 02:29:34,400
We'll call it island sick. Nope.
If I did, I get on a plane.

2546
02:29:35,040 --> 02:29:38,930
It's people who are awesome there, man.
It's just a different, more relaxed, more.

2547
02:29:38,931 --> 02:29:42,800
Um, I don't know. They're just more chill.
They say Costa Rica is a place to go to.

2548
02:29:42,860 --> 02:29:46,910
Costa Rica is pretty bad ass. I say
it's a best place to retire. Yeah,

2549
02:29:47,090 --> 02:29:49,670
that's what I've heard.
Cause it's like $1,000 a month.

2550
02:29:49,671 --> 02:29:52,970
He can live well or something. Yeah.
Mel gives us, got a fat spread there.

2551
02:29:52,971 --> 02:29:55,580
He's telling me he's got like
500 acres down there. Nice.

2552
02:29:55,581 --> 02:29:58,110
That was a cool podcast with Mel
Gibson. He's an interesting cat. Huh?

2553
02:29:58,940 --> 02:30:00,160
Here's my impression of Mel Gibson.

2554
02:30:02,640 --> 02:30:05,300
He just can't look in the fucking bed.
He was,

2555
02:30:05,750 --> 02:30:09,140
he just kept clicking the pen and I
didn't want to say anything. It was like,

2556
02:30:09,141 --> 02:30:12,740
what do I say? Stop clicking the
pen, man. I wanted to hear like,

2557
02:30:13,160 --> 02:30:14,930
I kinda want to hear you
interview him a little bit.

2558
02:30:14,931 --> 02:30:16,310
It was like all the stem cell guy.

2559
02:30:16,490 --> 02:30:19,340
Well he wanted to come on
and talk about stem cells.

2560
02:30:19,370 --> 02:30:23,150
That's really what he wanted to talk
about. And so I honored that. I said,

2561
02:30:23,151 --> 02:30:25,030
all right man. You know, that's
what you want to talk about.

2562
02:30:25,060 --> 02:30:29,240
You think he's your biggest
guests that you've ever had? Uh,

2563
02:30:29,510 --> 02:30:33,290
it was pretty fucking famous. James
Hetfield. He's pretty fucking famous too.

2564
02:30:33,890 --> 02:30:37,400
I mean, I dunno, they're up
there. Who else? Alex Jones.

2565
02:30:39,230 --> 02:30:41,300
He's the biggest valid stubbles downloads.

2566
02:30:41,630 --> 02:30:46,430
Alex beat everybody but didn't really
fuck load. Yeah man, it was interesting.

2567
02:30:46,520 --> 02:30:50,720
So here's my theory on Alex Jones.
Just if you want to go there,

2568
02:30:51,230 --> 02:30:56,150
I love going there. So I think
he's a government plot. He's not,

2569
02:30:57,250 --> 02:31:00,650
I tell you that for sure. I've known
him forever. I've known Alex since 1998.

2570
02:31:01,910 --> 02:31:05,480
He's not, but he couldn't because
she would tell everybody he's not.

2571
02:31:06,260 --> 02:31:07,850
I've hung out with that guy,
get high with him,

2572
02:31:08,420 --> 02:31:12,560
drunk with him and he's a fun dude.
He is a guy who started out, uh,

2573
02:31:12,620 --> 02:31:15,620
as a guy who was a against the president.

2574
02:31:15,800 --> 02:31:19,980
He was against George W. Bush,
w Bush. I don't even think he

2575
02:31:19,980 --> 02:31:22,920
was probably was running for president
at the time. Right. Where was he?

2576
02:31:23,670 --> 02:31:27,360
When was it? When did Bush become
no, Clinton was president. Yeah,

2577
02:31:27,480 --> 02:31:28,710
Clinton was president.

2578
02:31:28,711 --> 02:31:33,480
George W was the governor of Texas and
he was getting arrested for protesting

2579
02:31:33,481 --> 02:31:34,141
against them,

2580
02:31:34,141 --> 02:31:36,960
protesting against the global elitists
and all these different things.

2581
02:31:37,270 --> 02:31:42,270
He didn't really become a supporter
of any form of government until Trump.

2582
02:31:43,770 --> 02:31:44,221
I mean,

2583
02:31:44,221 --> 02:31:47,910
Trump is like the first guy and he may
or may not be getting played by Trump

2584
02:31:47,911 --> 02:31:52,530
where Trump's his buddy. And I
mean Trump is a, he's a slick guy.

2585
02:31:52,531 --> 02:31:57,350
In terms of how he, uh, cultivates
influence. Is it an anomaly? For sure.

2586
02:31:57,930 --> 02:32:00,540
He's, he's an interesting character
and a lot of ways. I mean,

2587
02:32:00,541 --> 02:32:04,800
if it wasn't shut down my theory to
a completed, they let me say, hey,

2588
02:32:04,801 --> 02:32:08,030
it's just a theory. I'm not,
propagate it as the factory then.

2589
02:32:08,250 --> 02:32:10,830
I've always thought the Alice Jones was,

2590
02:32:11,550 --> 02:32:16,550
was built by the government to make
conspiracy theories look like loons he

2591
02:32:16,861 --> 02:32:21,150
didn't use to make them look like
loons. He, no, no, he was much more,

2592
02:32:21,210 --> 02:32:25,920
uh, I started with nine
11 though, right? No,

2593
02:32:25,990 --> 02:32:29,190
no way before now and let,
I mean that with Waco,

2594
02:32:29,220 --> 02:32:31,110
but that's when he came to prominence.
Right.

2595
02:32:31,111 --> 02:32:36,060
That could cause he was the first to, to
calm down even before then. Man. You know,

2596
02:32:36,350 --> 02:32:39,750
I mean, nobody cared about it
before was an am radio before then,

2597
02:32:40,230 --> 02:32:43,540
but he's been around forever.
I mean, like I said, I met him.

2598
02:32:45,060 --> 02:32:49,320
I met him in 98 so it was
several years before 2001 and a,

2599
02:32:49,321 --> 02:32:53,400
he was doing the same shit back then. I
mean, he's always been around doing that.

2600
02:32:54,090 --> 02:32:57,930
He's, he's right about a lot of shit
and that's what's so confusing, right?

2601
02:32:58,110 --> 02:33:02,010
Like he is absolutely right about what
they're called agent provocateurs,

2602
02:33:02,011 --> 02:33:05,550
where the government will send in
people if they have a peaceful protest.

2603
02:33:05,550 --> 02:33:07,740
It's very inconvenient for them.
Like the WTO,

2604
02:33:07,980 --> 02:33:12,660
he did this whole video about how the
WTO was that in Vancouver or Seattle,

2605
02:33:12,690 --> 02:33:15,910
where was the WTO? I forget
where it was. Why don't want,

2606
02:33:15,930 --> 02:33:18,030
it was somewhere in the Pacific northwest.
I'm confused,

2607
02:33:18,350 --> 02:33:20,250
but I'm not confused about the story.

2608
02:33:20,490 --> 02:33:25,110
So what happened was they had these
peaceful protests against the World Trade

2609
02:33:25,110 --> 02:33:25,771
Organization and uh,

2610
02:33:25,771 --> 02:33:28,500
it was very inconvenient because all
these world leaders were coming to this,

2611
02:33:28,501 --> 02:33:29,880
this area for this meeting.

2612
02:33:30,240 --> 02:33:35,240
And they sent in government agents that
were dressed with blast black ski masks

2613
02:33:36,151 --> 02:33:37,740
and a government issue,
boots.

2614
02:33:37,890 --> 02:33:41,760
And these people started smashing
windows and lighting things on fire.

2615
02:33:41,880 --> 02:33:43,830
They turned into a violent protest,

2616
02:33:43,980 --> 02:33:48,570
which enabled the police to close
in and shut down the protest.

2617
02:33:49,040 --> 02:33:52,620
You'd WTO protests. Where did say Alex
Jones police state to the takeover.

2618
02:33:52,650 --> 02:33:56,190
Seattle. Yeah, we'll
Seattle. Okay. So they said,

2619
02:33:56,191 --> 02:34:01,191
but this is a real tactic that
governments and intelligence agencies use.

2620
02:34:02,190 --> 02:34:05,940
They have a peaceful protest and then
they have these people like these guys

2621
02:34:05,941 --> 02:34:10,110
dressed in black ski masks,
they start tipping over newspapers.

2622
02:34:10,530 --> 02:34:12,570
Like it doesn't even make any sense.
Like, why are they doing this?

2623
02:34:13,040 --> 02:34:15,000
There are government agents.
Meanwhile the,

2624
02:34:15,001 --> 02:34:19,980
these guys have government issued boots.
No, it further. So these guys all, um,

2625
02:34:20,290 --> 02:34:25,290
they all got together at the end and they
were cordoned off into a building and

2626
02:34:25,301 --> 02:34:27,760
then there were ultimately released.
They were never charged.

2627
02:34:27,940 --> 02:34:29,920
They were never arrested.
I mean,

2628
02:34:29,950 --> 02:34:34,260
the whole thing is incredibly
fascinating and, uh,

2629
02:34:34,300 --> 02:34:38,650
some of them have been
identified as government agents
and Alex and get way more

2630
02:34:38,651 --> 02:34:42,600
into detail about it. That's why I'm,
you know, I'm not a conspiracy theorist,

2631
02:34:42,601 --> 02:34:44,170
so to speak.
Um,

2632
02:34:45,160 --> 02:34:49,210
but the one thing I always say is I
don't put anything past our governments.

2633
02:34:49,270 --> 02:34:52,840
There's absolutely been conspiracies
that are real. For sure, for sure.

2634
02:34:52,990 --> 02:34:56,620
Whether it's the Gulf of Tonkin incident,
whether it's operation Northwoods,

2635
02:34:56,621 --> 02:34:57,880
there's a bin,
and there's,

2636
02:34:57,970 --> 02:35:00,460
I'm sure there's been a bunch
that we don't know about.

2637
02:35:00,461 --> 02:35:03,850
I believe that the government
assassin or somebody assassinated JFK.

2638
02:35:04,030 --> 02:35:07,450
I don't think it was Lee Harvey Oswald
acted alone. I think it's very possible.

2639
02:35:07,480 --> 02:35:09,280
Lee Harvey Oswald was a part of it.

2640
02:35:09,281 --> 02:35:14,020
But I know too much about bullets to think
that that fucking bullet went through

2641
02:35:14,021 --> 02:35:18,550
two people and wound up on Connolly's
Gurney in the hospital looking pristine,

2642
02:35:18,910 --> 02:35:22,990
cut the shit. That's all. I don't
think that's real at all. Nice. Nice.

2643
02:35:24,030 --> 02:35:28,720
I've seen the Zapruder film. I, I've,
I've read several books on the story.

2644
02:35:28,721 --> 02:35:29,111
I just,

2645
02:35:29,111 --> 02:35:34,000
I think it's very convenient to lump
all that into one guy with one bullet.

2646
02:35:34,001 --> 02:35:36,800
I think it's horse shit.
And I think they probably killed him.

2647
02:35:38,270 --> 02:35:42,580
See how he's always looking into a
little bit, you know, and then, um, my,

2648
02:35:43,210 --> 02:35:45,940
you know, uh, the government
probably did it. Shit, whatever.

2649
02:35:46,030 --> 02:35:47,770
They probably give a shit.

2650
02:35:47,890 --> 02:35:50,590
They probably did a lot of shit that we
don't know about that we're not aware of

2651
02:35:50,970 --> 02:35:52,270
it.
This is how governments work.

2652
02:35:52,300 --> 02:35:55,550
They've always worked like desert zone
intelligence agencies work. The uh,

2653
02:35:56,200 --> 02:36:00,650
smart criminals go to politics that
dumb criminals go to jail, right?

2654
02:36:01,060 --> 02:36:04,450
There's a lot of that. Honestly,
a lot of that. How many or,

2655
02:36:04,630 --> 02:36:06,550
or you know,

2656
02:36:06,551 --> 02:36:10,630
the most criminally saying people in
this world are attracted to politics?

2657
02:36:10,840 --> 02:36:14,680
I think what's going to fix human beings,
and this is a radical idea,

2658
02:36:14,950 --> 02:36:19,360
but I really think the same thing that's
going to fix human beings is what is in

2659
02:36:19,361 --> 02:36:20,290
a lot of ways,

2660
02:36:20,980 --> 02:36:25,120
disrupting the standards of our culture
right now and with the Internet.

2661
02:36:25,420 --> 02:36:29,310
I think technology is going to fix human
beings because I think what technology

2662
02:36:29,311 --> 02:36:34,311
is going to do is eventually there's
going to be a way to absolutely detect

2663
02:36:34,691 --> 02:36:37,840
whether or not someone's telling
the truth. I think it's inevitable.

2664
02:36:38,230 --> 02:36:40,210
I think as we dug up,

2665
02:36:40,211 --> 02:36:43,240
a lot of people's got to fuck up a lot
of people's lives and it's going to Hanse

2666
02:36:43,300 --> 02:36:44,320
most of our lives,

2667
02:36:44,710 --> 02:36:48,070
and I think people like you and
people like me who tell the truth,

2668
02:36:48,640 --> 02:36:52,960
it's going to be very good for
you because I think there's,

2669
02:36:53,590 --> 02:36:57,550
I think when you lie, it doesn't just
fuck up the person that you're lying to.

2670
02:36:57,551 --> 02:37:01,300
I think it fucks you up. I think it
fucks up discourse. It fucks up culture.

2671
02:37:01,301 --> 02:37:05,830
I think it fucks up human beings. It
fucks up our communities. It's just,

2672
02:37:05,890 --> 02:37:07,930
it's a,
it's an anomaly.

2673
02:37:07,931 --> 02:37:11,620
It's a thing that people have been able
to figure out how to do when you've been

2674
02:37:11,621 --> 02:37:13,450
able to say things that aren't accurate,

2675
02:37:13,451 --> 02:37:16,490
to convince someone of a reality
that doesn't exist. I guess where,

2676
02:37:16,550 --> 02:37:21,260
where I think it gets hard though is the
politic politician specifically are so

2677
02:37:21,261 --> 02:37:24,020
good at, not really lying, but like crow,

2678
02:37:24,050 --> 02:37:27,770
you know they're right on that gray area
where they don't know really lying to

2679
02:37:27,771 --> 02:37:31,310
you, but they're not. That's, but
that's also because you can lie.

2680
02:37:31,520 --> 02:37:34,780
So you'll be like a guy like Trump
who's been busted lying a million times.

2681
02:37:34,781 --> 02:37:38,050
It's still is a notch probably
every president for sure. Dot.

2682
02:37:38,060 --> 02:37:42,320
I don't think he does. I don't think
he's unique in that and that's,

2683
02:37:42,680 --> 02:37:47,670
well he's unique in his propensity for
it. I mean he loves it. He's a good,

2684
02:37:47,770 --> 02:37:49,130
I mean he had been lying forever,

2685
02:37:49,370 --> 02:37:53,900
but I think that without a doubt there
was going to be a time in the future,

2686
02:37:53,901 --> 02:37:58,790
whether it's in our lifetimes or after
where they develop technology that's

2687
02:37:58,791 --> 02:38:02,420
going to absolutely allow you to detect
whether or not someone's telling the

2688
02:38:02,421 --> 02:38:04,160
truth. I sent tense. Yeah,

2689
02:38:04,161 --> 02:38:08,290
I think it's going to be the future and
I think when that happens people are

2690
02:38:08,291 --> 02:38:12,500
just not going to accept all this shit
that we've accepted for so many years.

2691
02:38:12,501 --> 02:38:13,640
It could be an APP on the phone.

2692
02:38:15,260 --> 02:38:17,810
I think it's probably going to be
something that you wear on your body.

2693
02:38:18,050 --> 02:38:19,400
I think we're real close to that.

2694
02:38:19,430 --> 02:38:22,280
I think we're real close to embedded
chips that you wear on your body.

2695
02:38:22,580 --> 02:38:25,910
And I think those chips are probably
going to interface wirelessly and you're

2696
02:38:25,911 --> 02:38:30,170
just going to be able to read thoughts
and ideas that come from people that are

2697
02:38:30,171 --> 02:38:32,840
going to come and probably a new language.
I think we're going to,

2698
02:38:32,850 --> 02:38:36,620
to be able to develop a universal
language. I don't have a lot of,

2699
02:38:36,760 --> 02:38:40,700
a lot of religious people say it's
a mark of the beast. Right? Oh,

2700
02:38:40,740 --> 02:38:43,710
that's like a birthmark or some shit.
Like what,

2701
02:38:43,711 --> 02:38:45,020
what are the religious people think?

2702
02:38:45,021 --> 02:38:49,620
Like a chip and it's what your body
was raised in an ultra religious thing

2703
02:38:50,000 --> 02:38:53,570
environment, right. My mom
was, it was extremely religious
and I talked in tongues.

2704
02:38:54,440 --> 02:38:58,480
They probably thought they did or
said no, no, they uh, you know,

2705
02:38:58,490 --> 02:39:01,830
they're very fundamental.
Um, you know, my,

2706
02:39:01,970 --> 02:39:06,260
my brother could go away deeper
into what they were about.

2707
02:39:06,261 --> 02:39:07,560
I never even paid attention,
but,

2708
02:39:07,760 --> 02:39:12,100
but I remember them talking about like
the mark of the beast in, they're like,

2709
02:39:12,110 --> 02:39:13,700
it's going to be something
implanted in you.

2710
02:39:13,701 --> 02:39:17,120
And if you take it then
you're going to hell.

2711
02:39:17,121 --> 02:39:19,880
And if you don't take it
or something like that.

2712
02:39:19,881 --> 02:39:22,460
And maybe with just planning ahead,
they want to keep lying.

2713
02:39:22,930 --> 02:39:25,570
We've got to keep planning, we've got to
plan ahead for these. Chips are clever.

2714
02:39:25,610 --> 02:39:29,150
Certainly lying to me, but I think
there's going to be a language,

2715
02:39:29,151 --> 02:39:31,730
a universal language that they
figured out how to teach the children.

2716
02:39:31,790 --> 02:39:36,050
I'd be fast starting with children because
children learn languages very easily

2717
02:39:36,230 --> 02:39:40,040
and if they develop a universal language
that is somehow or another either

2718
02:39:40,041 --> 02:39:45,041
translated through computers cause you
know they have a thing now these Google

2719
02:39:45,481 --> 02:39:47,930
ear buds that you use
with a pixel two phones.

2720
02:39:47,931 --> 02:39:49,490
So if you were talking to me in Spanish,

2721
02:39:49,520 --> 02:39:52,580
I would hear the translation of
what you said in English in my ears.

2722
02:39:52,880 --> 02:39:55,490
That's fucking amazing.
When I saw that, I was like,

2723
02:39:55,491 --> 02:39:57,620
how has nobody noticing
that this is step one.

2724
02:39:57,830 --> 02:39:59,960
This is step one of a universal language.

2725
02:40:00,890 --> 02:40:03,590
The translation to English is fascinating,

2726
02:40:03,620 --> 02:40:08,480
but I think ultimately we're going to
be able to figure out how to communicate

2727
02:40:08,481 --> 02:40:13,250
with everybody with a new language.
And this, this, this is not hard.

2728
02:40:13,350 --> 02:40:14,183
Do,
I mean it's

2729
02:40:14,280 --> 02:40:18,000
obviously not easy, but it's not
impossible to develop a new language,

2730
02:40:18,001 --> 02:40:21,540
like a universal language that's
accepted by everybody. Yeah.

2731
02:40:22,540 --> 02:40:25,680
I used a, uh, I have a Brazilian
friend that comes up, uh,

2732
02:40:25,740 --> 02:40:30,120
to my house sometimes and we put the
Google translate thing just right in

2733
02:40:30,121 --> 02:40:32,160
between us and you can talk in,

2734
02:40:32,161 --> 02:40:36,330
it detects which language and it
says it. Isn't that crazy? Yeah.

2735
02:40:36,810 --> 02:40:40,720
That's crazy. So he knows which like you
don't know who's talking without even,

2736
02:40:40,721 --> 02:40:45,000
you don't have ear phones or nothing. All
to say it out loud. Yeah. That's amazing.

2737
02:40:45,270 --> 02:40:47,710
I mean it's not a hundred percent
accurate and sometimes you have to swipe,

2738
02:40:48,000 --> 02:40:52,530
I think this is one step and then I think
the next step is going to be some sort

2739
02:40:52,531 --> 02:40:55,020
of a way to detect whether
or not people are lying.

2740
02:40:55,260 --> 02:40:58,050
And then another step is going to
be more enhanced communication.

2741
02:40:58,050 --> 02:41:03,050
And then another step after that is going
to be some sort of telekinetic or some

2742
02:41:03,600 --> 02:41:07,680
sort of, uh, communication without
verbalizing, without words.

2743
02:41:07,710 --> 02:41:12,210
Fuck all that's comment. I'll
just be out in the woods. Yeah.

2744
02:41:12,211 --> 02:41:14,400
Y'All do your thing.
I'm going to hang out out here.

2745
02:41:14,430 --> 02:41:17,520
It might be the best way to live. I
mean that's how I want to live. I mean,

2746
02:41:17,820 --> 02:41:21,480
my wife is a more of
a city person sort of.

2747
02:41:21,540 --> 02:41:25,640
I mean it's got to get a weekend spot and
evergreen or something. Dude, I want to,

2748
02:41:25,720 --> 02:41:30,720
yeah, I supposed to do a thing with, uh,
what's his name? Um, uh, Denver work.

2749
02:41:30,810 --> 02:41:33,120
Oh yeah, the navy seal. He's
doing like campfire thing.

2750
02:41:33,170 --> 02:41:35,250
They're supposed to have
a nice chat with him.

2751
02:41:35,380 --> 02:41:38,310
Yesterday we were texting each other
at the campfire there. No, he's about,

2752
02:41:38,340 --> 02:41:40,560
he's going to come on and do the
podcast whenever he's in town,

2753
02:41:40,561 --> 02:41:44,050
which is trying to figure out
a time. Yeah, I was texting
with him. Oh, a Twitter.

2754
02:41:44,400 --> 02:41:46,670
He's doing, I guess it's called
like a campfire sessions.

2755
02:41:46,671 --> 02:41:50,670
So you go out there and hang out with
this campfire and he'd just tell stories.

2756
02:41:50,690 --> 02:41:54,840
Yeah. He's a fascinating guy. He's been
on my friend Steve's television show,

2757
02:41:54,841 --> 02:41:59,730
a meat eater. Okay. He's been on that.
Yeah. He's a fascinating, intense guy.

2758
02:41:59,790 --> 02:42:04,090
Nice. Yeah. Yeah. I wanted to
bring my kids, but he's, he,

2759
02:42:04,950 --> 02:42:08,330
he's a great guy. I'm sure he could
bring your kids, but I think, uh,

2760
02:42:08,740 --> 02:42:12,270
anytime you could get a place we get away,

2761
02:42:12,300 --> 02:42:16,380
we can get to nature to see the real
stars at night and have a campfire.

2762
02:42:16,381 --> 02:42:19,110
It's just reinvigorating.
It's just great for you and man.

2763
02:42:19,620 --> 02:42:20,760
Did you see the eclipse?

2764
02:42:20,820 --> 02:42:23,280
Did you know you didn't do
look a little bit my backyard,

2765
02:42:23,281 --> 02:42:25,860
but I almost burned my eyes.
I don't have the right goggles.

2766
02:42:25,890 --> 02:42:28,410
I tried to put two sunglasses on
the, I was like, that don't work.

2767
02:42:28,411 --> 02:42:31,710
That was like the probably the
deepest nature. Well my wife,

2768
02:42:31,711 --> 02:42:34,440
her family is up in Vermont, so we get
us a pretty deep nature up there. But,

2769
02:42:34,920 --> 02:42:37,770
but we were up in this
place in Wyoming where,

2770
02:42:38,460 --> 02:42:42,290
I mean there was a million people there
that weekend, but I don't think, you know,

2771
02:42:42,380 --> 02:42:46,460
there's probably not a hundred
people within a hundred
miles. Right, right, right,

2772
02:42:46,470 --> 02:42:50,190
right. And a man, that was the first
time I ever looked up in the sky.

2773
02:42:50,191 --> 02:42:53,640
Cause see the Milky Way though?
Oh, you know what you gotta do go.

2774
02:42:53,730 --> 02:42:54,810
If you go to Hawaii,

2775
02:42:54,990 --> 02:42:59,400
you got a planet for when there's no
moon and go to the Keck observatory.

2776
02:42:59,690 --> 02:43:02,760
There's the Keck observatory
on the big island. Fuck man.

2777
02:43:02,761 --> 02:43:07,320
Because the big island is designed the
lighting system. Yeah, it's darker,

2778
02:43:07,321 --> 02:43:11,380
but they have the lighting system designed
in the big island to have diffused on

2779
02:43:11,381 --> 02:43:12,214
the street lamps.

2780
02:43:12,310 --> 02:43:15,320
With that means is that the light
doesn't disperse it to the sky.

2781
02:43:15,970 --> 02:43:19,930
And so when you go up to the Keck
observatory, man, you see everything.

2782
02:43:19,931 --> 02:43:24,550
It blew me away. I saw it.
Yeah. That's what it looks like.

2783
02:43:24,580 --> 02:43:27,840
Like legitimately what it looks like.
Like you go up there and you look up,

2784
02:43:27,860 --> 02:43:31,990
you're like Ho Lee shit
because it's so high.

2785
02:43:31,991 --> 02:43:36,970
I think it's 13,000 feet above sea
level. Oh Wow. You go up there and um,

2786
02:43:37,250 --> 02:43:40,240
they had mountains at big up. Oh
yeah, they do. And on the big island,

2787
02:43:40,270 --> 02:43:42,340
the big island has like a different world.

2788
02:43:42,370 --> 02:43:45,650
They have a bunch of different ecosystems
up there. They have a rain forums,

2789
02:43:45,651 --> 02:43:49,720
they have a desert, they have mountain
ranges, they have lava. But it's,

2790
02:43:49,930 --> 02:43:53,710
it changed my life and I'm
not bullshitting. It's like
a psychedelic experience.

2791
02:43:54,070 --> 02:43:56,980
When I went up there and saw the stars
like that, I was like, oh, I didn't even,

2792
02:43:57,040 --> 02:43:58,450
I don't even,
I mean,

2793
02:43:58,451 --> 02:44:01,340
if there's something to make you
feel like a tiny fucking Spec,

2794
02:44:03,040 --> 02:44:04,360
you feel like you're on a space ship,

2795
02:44:04,570 --> 02:44:06,990
you feel like you're on a spaceship
flying through the universe.

2796
02:44:07,120 --> 02:44:08,590
That's how it felt when I was in Wyoming.

2797
02:44:08,940 --> 02:44:12,190
It just you that eclipse
obviously blew me away too.

2798
02:44:12,450 --> 02:44:16,420
You don't realize how many stars are up
there and how much our street lights are

2799
02:44:16,421 --> 02:44:20,830
fucking us over because it's changing
the way you view the cosmos itself.

2800
02:44:20,831 --> 02:44:25,450
It's changing your relationship that you
have with infinity, with the universe.

2801
02:44:25,480 --> 02:44:27,140
I mean it's changing it because we,

2802
02:44:27,300 --> 02:44:32,300
it's Dalling our perceptions by limiting
all of this spectacular light in these

2803
02:44:33,181 --> 02:44:36,310
stars that we, the meal, the
Milky Way, like this whole thing.

2804
02:44:36,490 --> 02:44:39,100
There's a reason why it
gives you this sense of awe.

2805
02:44:39,340 --> 02:44:41,260
Like it's a perspective enhancer.

2806
02:44:41,261 --> 02:44:46,060
It gives you this view of something
that's impossibly beautiful and also

2807
02:44:46,120 --> 02:44:50,780
impossibly huge and it just puts it
all in perspective. I think I made it.

2808
02:44:50,800 --> 02:44:52,990
That's why people are so cocky and cities,
they're just,

2809
02:44:53,800 --> 02:44:56,950
they're missing that they're
missing this re this reality check.

2810
02:44:56,950 --> 02:45:00,550
And the weird part is I that's small shit.

2811
02:45:00,580 --> 02:45:03,340
Like this is actually the milky way
is like a small galaxy, right? Yeah.

2812
02:45:03,370 --> 02:45:04,203
It's nothing.

2813
02:45:04,630 --> 02:45:09,190
It's one of hundreds of billions
of galaxies in the known universe.

2814
02:45:09,610 --> 02:45:11,580
And there's not aliens.
Well, I was talking to me,

2815
02:45:11,590 --> 02:45:14,770
I did Neil degrasse Tyson's TV show a
couple of days ago and he was telling me

2816
02:45:14,771 --> 02:45:19,771
that it's the most likely scenario is
that we live in multiverses and that our

2817
02:45:20,201 --> 02:45:22,240
universe,
which is impossibly large,

2818
02:45:22,420 --> 02:45:27,420
is one of an infinite number of
universes that are all in these bubbles.

2819
02:45:27,760 --> 02:45:30,760
Can you, uh, explain? Nope.

2820
02:45:32,560 --> 02:45:35,590
He said it to me and I was
like, wait, what is this?

2821
02:45:36,670 --> 02:45:40,350
It looks like googled it and this is
the images that pop up. He kinda got,

2822
02:45:40,380 --> 02:45:43,920
just trust him on that one. Right? Well
whenever he says something like Kinda Guy,

2823
02:45:44,830 --> 02:45:47,620
you like, you're the expert. But
anytime I talk to astrophysicists,

2824
02:45:47,621 --> 02:45:52,420
I just try to probe as much as possible
and just trust them that you can't argue

2825
02:45:52,421 --> 02:45:53,080
with them about it.

2826
02:45:53,080 --> 02:45:58,080
But the idea is that like how we have
a planet and the planet part of a solar

2827
02:45:58,091 --> 02:46:01,420
system and the solar system is a part
of a galaxy and the galaxy is a part of

2828
02:46:01,421 --> 02:46:05,790
the universe. The universe is a part of
a multiverse and then it's just as is.

2829
02:46:05,920 --> 02:46:09,890
There is a fractal nature to it all and
then it just keeps getting bigger and

2830
02:46:09,891 --> 02:46:10,281
bigger.

2831
02:46:10,281 --> 02:46:14,930
And the idea that's multiverse is that
there is infinite number of different

2832
02:46:14,931 --> 02:46:15,340
universe.

2833
02:46:15,340 --> 02:46:15,521
Now,

2834
02:46:15,521 --> 02:46:20,521
did he say that's a theoretically the
most likely or that there's some sort of

2835
02:46:21,221 --> 02:46:24,790
evidence or there's some,
some reason to believe it outside?

2836
02:46:25,030 --> 02:46:28,720
Because my biggest thing is we have all
these theories for all this shit. Yeah,

2837
02:46:28,870 --> 02:46:33,250
Big Bang, God, whatever. Uh, you
know, have a far the universities.

2838
02:46:33,890 --> 02:46:38,290
But can our minds really even wrap around
what the reality probably actually is?

2839
02:46:38,291 --> 02:46:43,210
Our minds may not even be able
to conceive the reality of this.

2840
02:46:43,211 --> 02:46:47,440
You know what I mean? We may not. It may
not. It may be beyond our imagination.

2841
02:46:47,580 --> 02:46:50,400
We, our imagination has kind of limited
to the things that we're supposed to be

2842
02:46:50,401 --> 02:46:51,810
experiencing. What we're here. You know,

2843
02:46:51,811 --> 02:46:55,170
we could abstractly think
about things outside of that,

2844
02:46:55,171 --> 02:46:59,490
but even when someone says to you like a
hundred billion stars, you're like, wow,

2845
02:46:59,491 --> 02:47:03,390
it's a lot. But that number's not even
getting in my head. Even after I've said,

2846
02:47:03,720 --> 02:47:06,630
yeah. Like I don't want to know what
that means. What does that even mean?

2847
02:47:06,660 --> 02:47:10,590
That to say there's more stars
than grains of sand on the earth.

2848
02:47:11,250 --> 02:47:16,050
That's what blows me away. Because I mean,
you just look at a jar of saying, yeah,

2849
02:47:16,051 --> 02:47:18,520
those are giant balls of fire.

2850
02:47:18,990 --> 02:47:22,560
Maybe more than a million times bigger
than earth is floating in the sky.

2851
02:47:22,800 --> 02:47:25,680
So we could see at the, at the
eclipse, I had a little observatory,

2852
02:47:25,681 --> 02:47:28,500
like all the colleges and stuff were,
were there where we were at,

2853
02:47:28,501 --> 02:47:33,270
and you could see, um, you come back in
like 10 minutes. I, in every 10 minutes,

2854
02:47:33,271 --> 02:47:35,850
come back and look through this one
telescope. You can see a star going around

2855
02:47:35,900 --> 02:47:38,780
the star. Wow. That
was fucking cool. Yeah.

2856
02:47:38,781 --> 02:47:43,781
I read something yesterday that Pluto
is so far away that one the time they

2857
02:47:44,721 --> 02:47:48,920
discovered it in 1930 it still hasn't
made a complete orbit around the sun.

2858
02:47:48,980 --> 02:47:52,920
Oh Shit.
How long does it take door of it?

2859
02:47:53,840 --> 02:47:55,850
I Dunno how long time.
Fucking time.

2860
02:47:56,180 --> 02:47:59,200
It is. The funniest part is the kids are
sitting there and they're like, oh yeah,

2861
02:47:59,201 --> 02:48:01,940
that's cool. Um, can we get some
fucking marshmallows or what?

2862
02:48:02,830 --> 02:48:03,750
Play video games.

2863
02:48:04,260 --> 02:48:09,260
Pluto's unusual orbit takes 248 earth
years for Pluto to complete one orbit

2864
02:48:09,391 --> 02:48:10,680
around the sun.
It's orbital path.

2865
02:48:10,681 --> 02:48:12,840
Doesn't lie in the same
plane as the eight planets,

2866
02:48:13,080 --> 02:48:17,550
but as inclined at an angle of 17 degrees
and it's not even a planet anymore.

2867
02:48:19,140 --> 02:48:23,610
Woo. Yeah. Mine fucker. Eric
Goes, how about Elon Musk's,

2868
02:48:23,611 --> 02:48:27,180
that crazy asshole shot of fucking
Tesla up in this space yesterday with a

2869
02:48:27,181 --> 02:48:30,130
mannequin on board singing a
David [inaudible] on board,

2870
02:48:30,280 --> 02:48:35,280
a mannequin dude sitting
in a Tesla roadster.

2871
02:48:35,610 --> 02:48:39,240
That's a like a mannequin.
Like it looks like a dude and he's there.

2872
02:48:39,270 --> 02:48:43,290
That's what it looks like. Yeah. Is this
live right now? You could see it yet.

2873
02:48:43,291 --> 02:48:44,700
It's songs on a billion time loop.

2874
02:48:44,710 --> 02:48:49,290
It's gonna play for a bill or how does
he have the battery for those song to

2875
02:48:49,291 --> 02:48:53,400
keep playing? He's got some sun and
he's lying. He's lying. The guys lie. I,

2876
02:48:53,450 --> 02:48:57,960
these batteries run out of go. You'd
go 248 miles. That car runs out of gas.

2877
02:48:58,030 --> 02:49:01,570
Straight explaining it. The
waiver. I thought, dude,

2878
02:49:02,040 --> 02:49:05,460
I thought he said actual fucking rockets.
Yeah,

2879
02:49:05,490 --> 02:49:09,510
there was an actual rocket
and the roadster with a
mannequin and it was attached

2880
02:49:09,511 --> 02:49:13,380
to the rocket. So at the very
apex of this rocket, as you know,

2881
02:49:13,450 --> 02:49:14,970
there's multistage rockets.

2882
02:49:15,090 --> 02:49:17,880
They pop this bitch out and
it goes flying through space.

2883
02:49:18,120 --> 02:49:20,040
He shot a fucking car and his space,

2884
02:49:20,400 --> 02:49:23,100
like imagine aliens
coming to earth and this,

2885
02:49:23,380 --> 02:49:25,800
and this is like the first thing they
finally like, what the fuck is this?

2886
02:49:25,801 --> 02:49:30,790
Is that a person? No, there's
the richest, craziest guy. Uh,

2887
02:49:30,810 --> 02:49:33,720
one of the richest, craziest guys
on earth, one of the smartest guys.

2888
02:49:33,840 --> 02:49:36,900
He just launched his cars in
a space for a good, I like,

2889
02:49:36,901 --> 02:49:38,040
these people are assholes.

2890
02:49:38,330 --> 02:49:43,150
You see a lot of rich people
that maybe want get richer,

2891
02:49:43,290 --> 02:49:44,790
they just want to get richer.
So the right thing,

2892
02:49:44,791 --> 02:49:47,700
just even how much money
is he blowing on this shit?

2893
02:49:49,280 --> 02:49:52,680
It's his main on earth by humans.
I think he blew $100 million to do this.

2894
02:49:52,920 --> 02:49:56,700
Click on that link of the image of the
Tesla with the earth behind it. Okay.

2895
02:49:57,770 --> 02:50:01,490
Who'd suits your brew man?

2896
02:50:02,030 --> 02:50:04,700
I mean that is just what a crazy image

2897
02:50:04,920 --> 02:50:07,800
did. I want to hear? I never
talked to Eddie about that.

2898
02:50:07,801 --> 02:50:10,770
I'll want to hear is real theory on that.
Eddie Bravo. Don't talk to him about it.

2899
02:50:11,030 --> 02:50:13,820
Did I want to hear it? They'll change
the way you think. It's got to change it.

2900
02:50:13,821 --> 02:50:17,460
Now there's a whole video of this going
from the bottom to no, it doesn't.

2901
02:50:17,461 --> 02:50:21,240
It's not based in reality, man.
It's not based in logic or reason.

2902
02:50:21,270 --> 02:50:25,260
It's basically has no logic behind it.
He wants to think the earth is flat. He,

2903
02:50:25,380 --> 02:50:28,620
he's like, you don't know. He doesn't
trust science. Doesn't trust scientists,

2904
02:50:28,621 --> 02:50:30,780
doesn't trust anybody. I mean, I get that,

2905
02:50:30,781 --> 02:50:33,570
but you got to have some logic
still to back it up. Right.

2906
02:50:33,670 --> 02:50:34,840
You know what,

2907
02:50:34,870 --> 02:50:38,200
one of the things that makes Eddie so
good at Jujitsu is he has an idea to get a

2908
02:50:38,201 --> 02:50:41,890
move on you and he's fucking completely
locked on that idea and everything

2909
02:50:41,891 --> 02:50:46,120
that's trying to shut that down is just
like he needs to come up with a defense

2910
02:50:46,121 --> 02:50:49,990
for that. He's good at that in a way.
That's how he looks at ideas as well.

2911
02:50:50,220 --> 02:50:54,070
So if he has an idea that the earth is
flat or that there's lizard people that

2912
02:50:54,071 --> 02:50:57,690
live under the ground, like
you got to move. I Dunno.

2913
02:50:57,970 --> 02:51:01,990
You got to prove that that's not real
to him. And if you can't prove it,

2914
02:51:01,991 --> 02:51:04,630
that's not real. And you say, well, look
at these pictures. Oh, that's bullshit.

2915
02:51:05,060 --> 02:51:07,300
They fake it.
They fake the moon landing six times.

2916
02:51:07,330 --> 02:51:08,610
Yeah,
you gotta get gotta Lot more than that.

2917
02:51:08,620 --> 02:51:12,580
I wanted to hear as a actual argument,
but I sit down with them. I'll film it.

2918
02:51:12,820 --> 02:51:15,190
I want it to turn the camera on.
I'll leave the room.

2919
02:51:15,460 --> 02:51:17,440
I went to his gym a couple of weeks ago,

2920
02:51:17,920 --> 02:51:22,510
I'd always heard that he talks a lot
at his gym or kind of goes on about

2921
02:51:22,511 --> 02:51:26,950
different things like that.
Yeah. And I was totally
prepared. I was like, fuck yeah,

2922
02:51:26,951 --> 02:51:30,580
let's go. Let's hear it. He didn't do
anything. He didn't barely even talk.

2923
02:51:30,581 --> 02:51:32,440
We just rolled the whole time.
He's probably happy. Were there,

2924
02:51:32,441 --> 02:51:35,940
I wanted to show you some
Jujitsu, Jujitsu wizard. He did.

2925
02:51:35,950 --> 02:51:39,730
He showed me some good Jujitsu. He
just, uh, I like his system. It's an,

2926
02:51:39,790 --> 02:51:44,390
it's an intense system, not, and you know,
the moves, I only know so much, but the,

2927
02:51:44,391 --> 02:51:48,760
uh, the concept of what do we
do at 99% of Jujitsu classes,

2928
02:51:48,761 --> 02:51:52,750
you go practice some new technique you
probably never did before and then you

2929
02:51:52,751 --> 02:51:56,920
start rolling and then you role and his,
the, when we went there, we, you know,

2930
02:51:56,921 --> 02:51:59,230
we drilled, drilled, drilled,

2931
02:51:59,231 --> 02:52:02,320
and this reminded me much more of
like a wrestling style practice.

2932
02:52:02,320 --> 02:52:05,920
And I liked it a lot in that terms.
That's why he,

2933
02:52:06,130 --> 02:52:10,810
that's why he designed it that way. He's
a real jujitsu genius. He really is. Yeah.

2934
02:52:11,170 --> 02:52:14,890
You know, I mean the, the conspiracy
thing, I think he just enjoys it.

2935
02:52:15,430 --> 02:52:18,910
He loves them. He loves it. You
Love Zoe sending me crazy shit.

2936
02:52:19,180 --> 02:52:22,420
I'm afraid I'll love it too much.
I once I actually have the time,

2937
02:52:22,780 --> 02:52:26,700
it's a giant distraction.
If you think Instagram is a
distraction, go, go, try to,

2938
02:52:26,720 --> 02:52:30,550
that's a problem. I mean, you
can't, like there's no website.

2939
02:52:30,580 --> 02:52:32,950
Maybe there should be where you
can just go on and say, okay,

2940
02:52:32,951 --> 02:52:34,540
this is what this PSI believes about it.

2941
02:52:34,541 --> 02:52:37,330
This is what this side believes about
it and you make up your own mind.

2942
02:52:37,690 --> 02:52:41,140
You got to dig through fucking Info wars.

2943
02:52:43,330 --> 02:52:47,210
And of course I give you, if you try
to tell someone, dude, it's true.

2944
02:52:47,211 --> 02:52:50,290
I said it on him for wars. They're
like, okay. Right. You're full of shit.

2945
02:52:50,320 --> 02:52:52,780
There's a few websites like
that, right? Like the Daily Mail,

2946
02:52:52,820 --> 02:52:56,200
the daily on the Daily Mail, your kids
though the radar or something like that.

2947
02:52:56,230 --> 02:52:58,990
There's a bunch of them. There's
a bunch of weird ones. Matt Brown.

2948
02:52:58,991 --> 02:53:01,150
I gotta wrap this up. I gotta get the
fuck out of here. But listen, man,

2949
02:53:01,151 --> 02:53:04,150
I appreciate your time. We appreciate you
being here as a pleasure. It's an honor.

2950
02:53:04,151 --> 02:53:08,500
When are you fighting Carlos
Condit? April 14th. Ooh. April 14th.

2951
02:53:08,501 --> 02:53:13,270
Motherfuckers tune in. Um, and it's,
I am the immortal on Instagram.

2952
02:53:13,271 --> 02:53:17,920
Bryant. Yeah. And what do you, what's
your Twitter? Same. Same, same.

2953
02:53:17,921 --> 02:53:21,550
I am the immortal and then in mortal
combat equipment dot. CEO. Thanks brother.

2954
02:53:21,580 --> 02:53:22,430
It's a pleasure.
Thank you.

2955
02:53:33,730 --> 02:53:33,810
Okay.
