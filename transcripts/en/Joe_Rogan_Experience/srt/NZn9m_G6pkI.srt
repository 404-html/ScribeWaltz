1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,710
Live music and then you know,
edited,

2
00:00:01,711 --> 00:00:02,500
but no,
we don't even fight.

3
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:04,650
Makes it feel alive and dirty.
It is dirty dude.

4
00:00:04,651 --> 00:00:06,800
It's dirty as fuck.
Bam.

5
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:08,730
Just music.
Maybe.

6
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,590
What is this called?
There was a slight pause.

7
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:11,640
What's the.
What's The music called?

8
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:13,180
Portal from the portal.
Soundtrack.

9
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:14,970
Still alive.
We tried to play this the other day,

10
00:00:14,971 --> 00:00:18,960
but I don't think I'm high enough.

11
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:29,940
Expansion.
You know,

12
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:37,770
you want another head of this straight 
homie.

13
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:44,450
Gone deeper.
How do you like that?

14
00:00:44,451 --> 00:00:49,451
I'm going for,
for you.

15
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:52,040
Just keep

16
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,280
offering free.
Started getting into good subjects.

17
00:01:15,131 --> 00:01:16,410
It's like save it,
save it,

18
00:01:16,411 --> 00:01:17,710
save it,
save it.

19
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:22,740
That's the problem.
When you get cool people to come out 

20
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:24,871
before the podcast,
then when you try and recycle the exact 

21
00:01:24,871 --> 00:01:25,630
same conversation so it doesn't have the
exact date.

22
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:31,300
Okay.
So earlier you were talking about hide 

23
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:31,300
your kids.
Hide your wife.

24
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:31,910
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

25
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,340
I'm that guy.
What happened to him?

26
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:35,930
Crazy.
Ladies and gentlemen,

27
00:01:35,931 --> 00:01:40,560
joining us in the podcast is the one and
only the real cliffy be Yay.

28
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:41,930
Bazinsky.
Is that?

29
00:01:41,931 --> 00:01:43,640
Am I saying it right?
Fresh off the plane.

30
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:45,500
Fresh off the plane.
If you don't know cliff,

31
00:01:45,501 --> 00:01:50,501
he be a behind us is gears of war is 
playing on the big screen in Casa de 

32
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:54,770
Brionne and that is one of the 
masterpieces from cliff ebb and a cliff.

33
00:01:54,771 --> 00:01:59,480
He is a game designer for epic games and
that's been my friend for a long time.

34
00:01:59,481 --> 00:02:01,190
We'd been friends for how long now?
It's like 10 years now.

35
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:02,860
Ten years bitches.
Thanks.

36
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:04,730
Joe.
Has a habit of basically going around to

37
00:02:04,731 --> 00:02:09,731
a harsh light touch it.
Is this the one you find in a beer can 

38
00:02:09,731 --> 00:02:12,710
that's the most used and horribly sweaty
fleshlight you've ever,

39
00:02:12,711 --> 00:02:13,220
ever had.

40
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:17,510
Puddles of yourself.
This is the flashlight.

41
00:02:17,511 --> 00:02:19,880
This is a sponsor of our podcast.
Before we go any further,

42
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,830
that's fleshlight in a camp.
If you go to.

43
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:23,240
Yeah,
and apparently this one,

44
00:02:23,241 --> 00:02:28,241
that's not the most effective one.
If you're just looking for something to 

45
00:02:28,241 --> 00:02:31,241
have sex with,
you might as well go with the standard 

46
00:02:31,241 --> 00:02:31,241
version.
The can.

47
00:02:31,241 --> 00:02:31,241
One is more of a novelty item.
It is a fee.

48
00:02:31,241 --> 00:02:33,980
You can get it done if you need to.
Look at is dripping with water.

49
00:02:33,981 --> 00:02:36,890
You're disgusting human being.
You are wretched.

50
00:02:36,891 --> 00:02:39,280
Brian went through a dry spell,
he broke up his girls like,

51
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:40,640
you know,
it's got excuses.

52
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:41,960
Oh Dude,
come on man,

53
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:44,060
stop it.
You're fucking freaking me out.

54
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:47,570
If you go to Joe Rogan,
did you go to Joe Rogan Net net?

55
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:48,800
Don't blame it on me,
man.

56
00:02:48,801 --> 00:02:50,080
That's not cool.
Soda.

57
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:52,070
Cool.
You wipe it on your pillow.

58
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:53,480
Your dog's going.
Oh man,

59
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:54,890
we got problems.
Anyway.

60
00:02:54,891 --> 00:02:56,210
Uh,
if you go to Joe Rogan.net,

61
00:02:56,211 --> 00:02:58,940
the answer in a click the link for the 
flashlight.

62
00:02:58,941 --> 00:03:00,080
You have 15 percent off to enter

63
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,520
in the code word Rogan sort him.
I asked you every week,

64
00:03:03,521 --> 00:03:05,200
and I always forget.
Anyway,

65
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:10,350
that's what that out of the way.
Cliff was nce lead game designer for 

66
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:12,310
gears of war and so many other fucking 
cool games.

67
00:03:12,311 --> 00:03:14,860
Unreal a design director.
Now design director.

68
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:20,370
Is that a different thing?
I mean it's basically like if you can 

69
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:20,370
prove yourself working on multiple 
projects,

70
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:24,700
then you get to try and like sprinkle a 
little bit of the magic fairy dust and 

71
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:27,391
all the other projects we've got coming.
I don't know if you saw that one you 

72
00:03:27,391 --> 00:03:27,391
have.
What is it?

73
00:03:27,391 --> 00:03:31,270
Well,
it's called bullets storm now what does 

74
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:31,270
that kind of like a here's you remember 
a firefly and serenity.

75
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:34,450
Those TV shows just weeding did kind of 
like that guy.

76
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:39,630
I sort like remember seeing the ads.
I don't think I ever like a drunk and 

77
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:40,630
space pirate who winds up crash landing 
on a planet.

78
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:45,630
And you wind up using like a combination
of crazy guns and your boot to kind of 

79
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:45,970
fight your way off the planet.
Oh yeah.

80
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:49,180
It's actually really fucking cool.
It's coming out in February.

81
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:54,570
Wow.
That sounds pretty good to go buy a 

82
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:54,570
bunch of crazy Polish guys.
And uh,

83
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:58,090
I've been working on that a bunch gotta 
get gotTa we got her iphone games 

84
00:03:58,090 --> 00:03:58,090
robbing this Thursday.
Oh,

85
00:03:58,090 --> 00:03:59,050
what is it?
It's called Infinity Blade.

86
00:03:59,051 --> 00:04:00,970
It's like punch out with swords.
Wow.

87
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,920
Iphone.
And uh,

88
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:05,350
will you be able to play against people?
Not yet.

89
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:08,020
First release is a,
just a one player,

90
00:04:08,021 --> 00:04:13,021
but I mean,
the beauty of apple right now is you 

91
00:04:13,021 --> 00:04:13,021
have these updates,
right?

92
00:04:13,021 --> 00:04:13,021
Everyone.
The PC days,

93
00:04:13,021 --> 00:04:13,840
he used to be patches and you're like,
shit,

94
00:04:13,841 --> 00:04:16,160
I gotta get patched.
The substance is broken now.

95
00:04:16,161 --> 00:04:17,770
It's updates and you're like,
wow,

96
00:04:17,771 --> 00:04:18,970
I'm getting it updated to gift.

97
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:23,980
It's like it's thing that people don't 
appreciate if you came up in the old 

98
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:24,880
windows days.
It's seamless.

99
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,740
Always works,
man.

100
00:04:26,741 --> 00:04:31,741
I started out with windows 95 and I'm 
sure you probably started way before 

101
00:04:31,741 --> 00:04:31,780
that.
I was showing her age dude.

102
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:37,580
Yeah,
windows 95 was the first pc that I ever 

103
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:40,471
had and I remember one time I somehow or
another I did something somehow or 

104
00:04:40,931 --> 00:04:45,931
another I installed my operating system 
onto one of those big drives where those

105
00:04:46,271 --> 00:04:49,570
big stupid drives remember those things?
No,

106
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:50,360
it was like,
oh,

107
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:52,440
and there's zip,
zip drive.

108
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:58,150
Slow ones was a big one.
Like it was probably like one megabyte 

109
00:04:58,150 --> 00:04:58,660
or something stupid,
but it wasn't that big stone tablet.

110
00:04:58,690 --> 00:04:59,710
Yeah,
it was giant.

111
00:04:59,711 --> 00:05:03,950
This big fucking brick shit or another.
That became my startup drive.

112
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,210
I installed windows and then it took 
like four days for your computer to boot

113
00:05:07,211 --> 00:05:07,390
up.

114
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:12,420
Wouldn't boot up.
It was just chaos and so I had to bring 

115
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:14,791
it into a guy who was a pc expert who 
figured out what the fuck I would 

116
00:05:14,791 --> 00:05:18,601
retardation.
That guy later went into the geek squad 

117
00:05:18,601 --> 00:05:19,660
and he's a billionaire now.
Meanwhile,

118
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:22,000
technology's built money,
right?

119
00:05:22,001 --> 00:05:27,001
Like anytime you have something like six
months later there's a new version that 

120
00:05:27,001 --> 00:05:27,001
comes out.
You're like,

121
00:05:27,001 --> 00:05:27,001
damn,
I got to upgrade this.

122
00:05:27,001 --> 00:05:28,630
They say that,
but I don't see it that way.

123
00:05:28,631 --> 00:05:33,631
I think it's exciting.
I don't think of like people folks 

124
00:05:33,631 --> 00:05:33,631
because you know,
you know,

125
00:05:33,631 --> 00:05:35,830
fucking the new shoots coming out and 
they build it that way.

126
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:37,780
No,
they're just trying to catch up with the

127
00:05:37,781 --> 00:05:42,781
ideas.
I think technology is moving at such a 

128
00:05:42,781 --> 00:05:42,940
fucking insane.
I got guys at work,

129
00:05:42,941 --> 00:05:43,840
they have kids right now.
My,

130
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:45,580
my buddy Lee,
he's one of our designers.

131
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:47,560
He pulled his daughter aside and he's 
like,

132
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:52,890
look,
things have gotten pretty cool in my 

133
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:54,271
lifetime.
You have absolutely no idea the things 

134
00:05:54,271 --> 00:05:55,090
you're in for like where the world is 
going like the world in 10,

135
00:05:55,091 --> 00:06:00,091
15 years,
it's going to be completely 

136
00:06:00,091 --> 00:06:00,091
unrecognizable.
I agree.

137
00:06:00,091 --> 00:06:00,091
It's

138
00:06:00,091 --> 00:06:00,740
like from where we were as kids,
like you can't even imagine,

139
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:02,840
right?
Like with nanotechnology and everything.

140
00:06:02,841 --> 00:06:04,150
It's unbelievable.
You and I,

141
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:09,200
I'm sorry,
you and I've had this conversation a 

142
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,931
couple of times and one of the things 
that you turned me onto his fucking 

143
00:06:10,931 --> 00:06:10,931
three d printers.
Yeah.

144
00:06:10,931 --> 00:06:15,190
The idea that you're going to be able to
have certain elements inside of a 

145
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:18,831
machine and you're going to be able to 
print objects we've talked about on the 

146
00:06:18,831 --> 00:06:21,941
podcast before,
that you're not going to have to go to 

147
00:06:21,941 --> 00:06:22,490
stores to buy things no more than you 
have to go to stores to get a picture.

148
00:06:22,491 --> 00:06:27,491
You can download a picture.
I already hate going to the store now 

149
00:06:27,491 --> 00:06:27,491
dude.
Like you know,

150
00:06:27,491 --> 00:06:30,670
you go to big box retail,
it takes like 45 minutes to find what 

151
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:30,670
you want.
Like okay,

152
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:33,911
so now I use Amazon,
but if I can actually have a fabricator 

153
00:06:33,911 --> 00:06:33,911
at my house,
they can print out a pen like fine,

154
00:06:33,911 --> 00:06:33,911
right?

155
00:06:33,911 --> 00:06:34,430
Because they have the,
you have the,

156
00:06:34,431 --> 00:06:37,340
like the wooden type ones right now that
kind of printed out of kind of like a,

157
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:38,790
like shaved material.
Right?

158
00:06:38,791 --> 00:06:43,791
And you can just send him a three d 
studio object and then they have metal 

159
00:06:43,791 --> 00:06:43,791
ones were just building metal object 
just layer by layer.

160
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:47,470
And then eventually it's going to be the
way to manipulate whatever atoms,

161
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,160
molecules to build whatever you want out
of it.

162
00:06:49,161 --> 00:06:51,740
It's unbelievable.
And that's coming online man.

163
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:53,210
And smart dust we were talking about.
Right.

164
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:55,250
That was another thing that you sent me 
hip to.

165
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,420
It was um,
the.

166
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:59,390
Well explain the whole thing for people 
who don't know what smart does at a very

167
00:06:59,391 --> 00:07:00,530
high level,
because again,

168
00:07:00,531 --> 00:07:03,140
I'm a bit of a luddite despite what I do
for living a,

169
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:08,170
it's a,
this kind of dust that they're able to 

170
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:09,881
sprinkle out in the battlefield that 
each one has a little bit of a 

171
00:07:09,881 --> 00:07:09,881
transmitter on it and they can detect if
anybody walks on it,

172
00:07:09,881 --> 00:07:14,141
like any sort of footstep patterns on it
because it essentially creates a little 

173
00:07:14,141 --> 00:07:14,141
network that then sends back to base.

174
00:07:14,141 --> 00:07:18,940
And then what happens is it can also 
kind of catching peoples' shoes and a 

175
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:18,940
little bit to their clothing.
You know,

176
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:22,470
there's just like little DNA bits you 
would find with pieces of hair and a 

177
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:22,470
crime scene and they can track whoever 
actually has that autumn right.

178
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:28,710
Combined where technology's going with 
the connectivity we have in the world 

179
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:28,710
and it's.
It's really scary,

180
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:29,180
right.
We talked about the end of privacy as we

181
00:07:29,181 --> 00:07:29,750
know it,
right?

182
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:31,550
How big are these things now?
They're tiny.

183
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:36,551
The size of a small grain of sand Motha 
fucker and I don't know how many are 

184
00:07:36,551 --> 00:07:36,551
actually out there yet.
Right?

185
00:07:36,551 --> 00:07:38,510
Like how much sand you get in your shoes
when you go to the beach.

186
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,070
I got a lot to you.
Imagine.

187
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,200
Could you imagine if all that sand.

188
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:45,440
You probably already have this right?
By the time we know about it,

189
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:47,450
I've always said about by the time we 
hear about it,

190
00:07:47,451 --> 00:07:50,070
that's been in use for years when they 
talk about clones in my.

191
00:07:50,071 --> 00:07:52,040
By the time they tell you they've cloned
the person,

192
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:53,750
the guy telling you is probably a clone.
Yeah.

193
00:07:53,751 --> 00:07:55,180
I wonder how many technology role

194
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:59,580
totally used by the government that if 
your average person knew about it,

195
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:00,030
result.

196
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:05,550
It's in the body spray.
I've gotten whole body sprays only for 

197
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:12,560
douchebags.
That's why they want to track douchebag 

198
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:12,560
activity thing when they step outside of
chimps,

199
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,230
when they do like medical studies on 
chimps,

200
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:19,440
test out Mascara on them and shit,
and that's what the old spice guy there 

201
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:19,440
in the bathroom there.
By the way,

202
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,880
I'm an old spice guy or whatever's 
cheapest.

203
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:23,140
Yeah,
whatever gets the job done and it has to

204
00:08:23,141 --> 00:08:23,780
be white.
I'm not.

205
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:27,100
I need white deodorant.
The blue kind.

206
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:29,650
It's like,
do you work?

207
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:31,370
Do you do the antiperspirant?
Yeah,

208
00:08:31,371 --> 00:08:36,371
I do.
I don't think that's a good thing for 

209
00:08:36,371 --> 00:08:36,371
your body.
Don't worry.

210
00:08:36,371 --> 00:08:38,500
I don't.
I know I stink sometimes,

211
00:08:38,501 --> 00:08:39,870
but I don't mind.
You know what?

212
00:08:39,871 --> 00:08:44,871
What's important to me?
It was important to me that they don't 

213
00:08:44,871 --> 00:08:44,871
clog my pores up when they're trying to 
leak out sweat.

214
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:50,100
What is that about?
Your just gumming up your pores like 

215
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:53,640
sweat doesn't come out plugging them.
You're using some sort of fucking nasty 

216
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,100
chemical that Jack's your whole,
your whole system.

217
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:56,010
How many people get armpit cancer?
If

218
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:57,360
I got armpit cancer,
I'd be like,

219
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,720
thank God I had the first at something.
I'm not,

220
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:02,940
I'm not scared of my sweat doesn't 
bother me.

221
00:09:02,941 --> 00:09:05,210
I'm sweaty all the time.
You do,

222
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:10,220
right.
That's the problem with once you start 

223
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:10,220
working at a body cam.
So Harry,

224
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:12,660
because my chest is Harry too,
so with all funks in there and it gets,

225
00:09:12,661 --> 00:09:13,350
you know,
skid,

226
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,500
get some sort of bacterial,
had day with your shirt off.

227
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:21,560
Not that bad,
but it's a lot of times too because all 

228
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,400
the way it starts itching and it gets 
caught in Jujitsu.

229
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,410
People pull your chest hair so you don't
wear deodorant,

230
00:09:25,411 --> 00:09:26,880
but you shave your chest.
Oh,

231
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,960
sexy as fuck.
You're.

232
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,730
You're just doing what?
I want to shave my chest,

233
00:09:29,731 --> 00:09:30,790
man.
I look at myself in the mirror.

234
00:09:30,791 --> 00:09:33,020
I'm like ready for the French Riviera 
Joe.

235
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:35,520
I don't shave my legs though.

236
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:40,540
I have no excuse to shave my legs.
I know some dudes who do because it gets

237
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,670
you out of submissions.
Easier.

238
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:42,560
Jujitsu guys,
while.

239
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:43,810
Yeah.
You're still hardcore into that.

240
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:44,670
Yeah,
that's fine.

241
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:49,710
Yeah.
What do you think this was at kraft 

242
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:51,440
mega?
The crap out of that is really fighting 

243
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,171
techniques.
I think if you wanted to just learn it 

244
00:09:54,171 --> 00:09:56,810
for self defense,
it's a good system because what they do 

245
00:09:56,810 --> 00:09:59,481
is they incorporate a lot of the best 
techniques and ground fighting and they 

246
00:09:59,481 --> 00:10:02,271
incorporate a lot of the best techniques
to stand up for someone just looking to 

247
00:10:02,271 --> 00:10:02,700
defend themselves.
It gives you a pretty comprehensive view

248
00:10:02,701 --> 00:10:05,040
of mixed of martial arts in general.
Look it up on Youtube,

249
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:07,170
man.
It's like half the videos or like how to

250
00:10:07,171 --> 00:10:12,171
get out of a gun situation and half of 
them are like legit guys through real 

251
00:10:12,171 --> 00:10:12,171
fast.

252
00:10:12,171 --> 00:10:12,270
The other half of white up dead.
Yeah,

253
00:10:12,271 --> 00:10:13,230
that's true.
But you know what?

254
00:10:13,231 --> 00:10:14,820
At least you have a chance.
You know?

255
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:19,880
It's like if you have an idea of what to
do and someone was trying to get get you

256
00:10:19,981 --> 00:10:24,981
with a gun,
most likely they're going to fucking 

257
00:10:24,981 --> 00:10:24,981
shoot you.
Right.

258
00:10:24,981 --> 00:10:24,981
But at least you have some sort of an 
idea.

259
00:10:24,981 --> 00:10:26,160
If an opportunity presents a take,
take,

260
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:28,110
take,
take control of it or not.

261
00:10:28,111 --> 00:10:33,111
Right?
I mean like that's what the whole idea 

262
00:10:33,111 --> 00:10:33,111
of martial arts is about.
It's not that you're going to be able to

263
00:10:33,111 --> 00:10:33,150
beat people up or you're gonna be able 
to fight.

264
00:10:33,151 --> 00:10:35,340
It's like at least you're gonna know 
what's happening.

265
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:39,270
It was like the scariest thing about any
sort of an altercation is when you don't

266
00:10:39,271 --> 00:10:40,620
know how to defend yourself.
You don't know what to do.

267
00:10:40,621 --> 00:10:45,621
And I've seen guys,
I saw this guy got knocked the fuck out 

268
00:10:45,621 --> 00:10:45,621
once and it was crazy.

269
00:10:45,621 --> 00:10:50,150
You're talking about like at a bar.
It was a bar and they got into a fight 

270
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:52,300
and as they got into a fight,
one guy was just that.

271
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:56,850
He just went into a full panic and was 
just swinging his hands.

272
00:10:56,970 --> 00:10:59,250
He wasn't even making girls.
Yes,

273
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:04,280
yes.
Full Papo swing his hands and a car got 

274
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:07,360
in front of me and as the car gun free 
because people were trying to get out of

275
00:11:07,361 --> 00:11:12,361
this parking lot while this fight was 
going on and as the car got in front of 

276
00:11:12,361 --> 00:11:12,361
me,
as the car passed,

277
00:11:12,361 --> 00:11:12,660
he was out cold on the ground.
Yeah,

278
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:17,840
flattened out first,
but it was a look in his eyes have 

279
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,010
complete total panic.
He had no idea what to do.

280
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:23,040
He was locked into this situation.
It was on sunset.

281
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:23,820
You understand?
I mean,

282
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:27,090
you doing what you do with mma and 
everything and being involved in the,

283
00:11:27,091 --> 00:11:28,740
in the scene.
Like when I went to the,

284
00:11:28,741 --> 00:11:31,170
I went to my first mma fight,
we saw the one in Charlotte,

285
00:11:31,171 --> 00:11:33,210
right.
Sit there and watching UFC and I'm like,

286
00:11:33,211 --> 00:11:38,211
you know,
I've seen it on at bars and I'm like 

287
00:11:38,211 --> 00:11:38,211
okay,
this is cool.

288
00:11:38,211 --> 00:11:38,211
And seeing it in person,
getting a huge amount of respect for the

289
00:11:38,211 --> 00:11:39,510
fighters and how tremendous athletes 
these guys are.

290
00:11:39,511 --> 00:11:40,520
Right?
But whatever,

291
00:11:40,521 --> 00:11:41,070
uh,
you know,

292
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:44,040
living in Raleigh and seeing bar fights 
which breakout in a regular basis,

293
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:47,120
they're not as bad as Boston by the way.
We need to talk about Boston dude.

294
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:52,840
That's the land of savages.
Twelve 30 hits and it's the witching 

295
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:55,981
hour is too many ugly.
Angry women do their pissed to cf 

296
00:11:55,981 --> 00:11:56,290
summit.
But we'll get there.

297
00:11:56,291 --> 00:12:01,291
We'll get there.
But like whenever I see a fight for 

298
00:12:01,291 --> 00:12:01,291
life,
dude,

299
00:12:01,291 --> 00:12:03,771
if it,
unless it's two guys who were scrappers 

300
00:12:03,771 --> 00:12:03,771
Mandy see like one guy picks a fight 
with the sky,

301
00:12:03,771 --> 00:12:05,380
just nobody's doing.
I think it's really ugly shit man.

302
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:10,410
When you see somebody actually 
legitimately get hit and beaten up like 

303
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:10,410
that before the staff and get to them,
that's pretty fucked up.

304
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:12,070
When someone knows how to fight in the 
other person doesn't.

305
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:17,130
I try to make friends with the biggest 
motherfuckers and tenants could hide 

306
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:17,410
behind people.
Notice,

307
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:22,440
notice when the shit's about to hit the 
fan and know where the door is all 

308
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:22,440
important.
You can smell it,

309
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:22,990
man.
Yeah.

310
00:12:22,991 --> 00:12:25,540
And they think about someone who does 
train in martial arts.

311
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:29,150
Most of the time you don't want to fight
because it's not the same thing anymore.

312
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:31,030
A good bouncer.
You know how to diffuse the situation,

313
00:12:31,031 --> 00:12:31,920
right?
You're not looking at cracks.

314
00:12:31,921 --> 00:12:33,070
Skulls.
It's not just that.

315
00:12:33,071 --> 00:12:35,080
It's like you kinda.
It's not attractive.

316
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:40,110
You know,
for some guys the idea of beating 

317
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:41,641
someone's asked is like attractive.
But when you do martial arts all the 

318
00:12:41,641 --> 00:12:41,641
time,
it's not attractive at all.

319
00:12:41,641 --> 00:12:42,310
It doesn't seem like a thing to do.
It seems like,

320
00:12:42,311 --> 00:12:43,690
you know,
what you want to do is avoid all that.

321
00:12:43,691 --> 00:12:44,830
This is a stupid.
This can get.

322
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:49,860
You can get hurt,
like you don't have any need to prove 

323
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:51,430
yourself physically were a lot of people
do and unfortunately sometimes they just

324
00:12:51,431 --> 00:12:52,860
trying to bluff,
you know,

325
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:54,940
and they get called out on it.
They don't know what to do.

326
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:59,941
They're already at step nine.
They don't know how that got there 

327
00:12:59,941 --> 00:12:59,941
because they're in Toronto.

328
00:12:59,941 --> 00:12:59,941
Right.
And then you know,

329
00:12:59,941 --> 00:13:04,201
and then they say,
well I to hear this guy and they go to 

330
00:13:04,201 --> 00:13:06,991
take a swing in the horror upon horrors 
is when you throw a punch at a guy and 

331
00:13:06,991 --> 00:13:11,080
he moves,
he actually knows how to fight and he's 

332
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,301
sober.
Then you're fucked because then you're 

333
00:13:13,301 --> 00:13:13,301
drunk and you did a Douche bag thing and
some guys going to let you up.

334
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:18,620
Next thing you know,
you're on the side of the street 

335
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:18,620
bleeding.
They're bleeding.

336
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:21,001
Or from my experience,
I mean there's always going to be 

337
00:13:21,001 --> 00:13:21,001
assholes that do martial arts,
like just assholes to do everything,

338
00:13:21,001 --> 00:13:22,420
but it's much,
much smaller.

339
00:13:22,421 --> 00:13:27,421
Number,
so the odds of someone who wants to 

340
00:13:27,421 --> 00:13:27,640
fight actually being a martial artist,
most of the time they're not.

341
00:13:27,641 --> 00:13:32,641
It's a big misconception like these guys
that are filing George Saint Pierre 

342
00:13:32,641 --> 00:13:35,581
who's like one of the nicest guy you're 
ever going to meet and even Josh 

343
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:35,770
Koscheck,
the guy who's fighting him this weekend,

344
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,180
fucking great guy.

345
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:42,210
If you're not fighting him.
I mean he likes to talk a lot of shit 

346
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:43,160
and likes to like get inside guys heads,
but a lot of that's pre-fight high.

347
00:13:43,161 --> 00:13:45,520
But outside of that he's a very nice.
A lot of those guys beat the shit out of

348
00:13:45,521 --> 00:13:47,170
each other and then they just the end,
they're just kinda like,

349
00:13:47,171 --> 00:13:52,171
what's.
Because it's a mutually kind of assumed 

350
00:13:52,171 --> 00:13:52,171
destruction,
right?

351
00:13:52,171 --> 00:13:52,171
They're like,
okay,

352
00:13:52,171 --> 00:13:52,171
I'm going into this.
That's my profession,

353
00:13:52,171 --> 00:13:52,300
right?
It's that.

354
00:13:52,301 --> 00:13:56,020
And some guys get real caught up in the 
shit talking and some guys,

355
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:58,780
some guys,
they drop it as soon as the fight's over

356
00:13:58,781 --> 00:13:59,530
and you know,
you see them,

357
00:13:59,531 --> 00:14:01,210
they'll go out and have beers and shit.
It's like,

358
00:14:01,211 --> 00:14:01,720
you know,
look,

359
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:04,630
there's a certain amount of stress 
involved in this person's your target.

360
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,760
You're going to be some animosity,
you know,

361
00:14:06,761 --> 00:14:11,761
but for the most part they'd like 
resolve it way better than boxers do 

362
00:14:11,761 --> 00:14:11,761
know.

363
00:14:11,761 --> 00:14:13,600
Boxers seem to be on,
I don't know what it is,

364
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:16,030
but there's like more douchebags in the 
boxing community.

365
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:19,180
I'm not exactly sure what that was like 
five,

366
00:14:19,181 --> 00:14:24,181
eight years ago and it was considered 
that nice thing and that that's always 

367
00:14:24,181 --> 00:14:24,181
the way with any sort of any sport,
right?

368
00:14:24,181 --> 00:14:28,411
Looking snowboarding.
And that was all the skiers looked down 

369
00:14:28,411 --> 00:14:28,411
on,
like that's a joke.

370
00:14:28,411 --> 00:14:29,080
That's never going to be big a doubt.
Snowboarding's Frickin huge.

371
00:14:29,081 --> 00:14:34,081
Right?
That happens with so many different 

372
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:34,081
sports.
Right.

373
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:35,080
When I was first involved in mma,
it was almost like telling people that I

374
00:14:35,081 --> 00:14:37,610
was involved in porn,
like,

375
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:39,670
yeah,
because I was working on Newsradio.

376
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:40,620
Right.
And uh,

377
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,950
and by the way,
I'm not the only one who said this.

378
00:14:41,951 --> 00:14:44,390
Dana White said the exact same thing.
He said the exact,

379
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:49,580
the exact same feeling.
You feel like you're doing something 

380
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:49,580
sleazy.

381
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:49,580
I say video games,
dude.

382
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:49,940
No,
no.

383
00:14:49,941 --> 00:14:50,620
Okay.
Dude.

384
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:51,380
When I was like,
okay,

385
00:14:51,381 --> 00:14:56,381
this is my story.
I was on news radio and I started doing 

386
00:14:56,381 --> 00:14:57,530
the backstage university UFC and this 
was 1997,

387
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:02,800
so this is like we were in Augusta,
Georgia and dove in Alabama and places 

388
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:06,941
like that and I would tell them that I 
was off to go do commentary for cage 

389
00:15:06,941 --> 00:15:07,560
fighter and they would look at me like,
what the fuck is wrong with you?

390
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,770
This is terrible for your career.
You want,

391
00:15:09,771 --> 00:15:12,920
you want people to know that you're,
you're commentating on cage fighting.

392
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:13,800
You know?
It's like,

393
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:15,680
it was almost like I was doing girls 
gone wild or something.

394
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:18,390
The video game analogy though,
I mean it's not a one to one,

395
00:15:18,391 --> 00:15:20,150
but at the same time it was one of the 
situations like,

396
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:20,970
you know,
10,

397
00:15:20,971 --> 00:15:22,380
15 years ago was like,
you want to do that?

398
00:15:22,381 --> 00:15:22,800
And it's like,
oh,

399
00:15:22,801 --> 00:15:23,620
that's cute.
You know,

400
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:28,690
my,
my little son plays that in the 

401
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:28,690
basement.
Right?

402
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:28,690
And now it's one of those things.
You look at everything from the three 60

403
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:30,590
that we to Natal and Oh,
I see what you're saying,

404
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:32,400
but it doesn't have a negative 
connotation.

405
00:15:32,401 --> 00:15:35,420
Does it not ever used to.
Now it's the coolest fucking drop and it

406
00:15:35,421 --> 00:15:35,940
was,
it used to,

407
00:15:35,941 --> 00:15:38,340
it was more of a frivolous connotation,
not a negative,

408
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,890
it wasn't negative,
it was more of a pat submissive.

409
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:45,960
Okay.
You run along little billy with your 

410
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:45,960
little video games thing because he used
to play pong.

411
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:45,960
Right?

412
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:50,150
Right.
But now there's games like call of duty 

413
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:50,150
that make more money,
way more than Avatar and that like,

414
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:50,810
that needs to sink into people's.

415
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:53,690
Had they go to the difference of $6 day 
one versus,

416
00:15:53,691 --> 00:15:54,410
you know,
10 bucks,

417
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:55,760
right.
Immediately takes,

418
00:15:55,761 --> 00:15:56,990
you know,
not as many people to do it.

419
00:15:56,991 --> 00:16:01,991
Right.
I mean they are getting so good at 

420
00:16:01,991 --> 00:16:01,991
building up the hype for these midnight 
launches for all of this.

421
00:16:01,991 --> 00:16:01,991
Right?
Like,

422
00:16:01,991 --> 00:16:06,570
I mean,
the biggest issue right now is how much 

423
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:06,570
of that money you think the actual 
developers are saying?

424
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:10,070
I don't know necessarily a lot.
There's a lot of controversy about call 

425
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:13,031
of duty.
I don't know if you heard the whole 

426
00:16:13,031 --> 00:16:13,031
thing,
please tell him is.

427
00:16:13,031 --> 00:16:13,280
So basically the call of duty guys 
originally were uh,

428
00:16:13,281 --> 00:16:14,240
these guys,
uh,

429
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:17,360
from infinity ward and Jason and fence.
Real good guys.

430
00:16:17,361 --> 00:16:18,380
And they,
uh,

431
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:23,440
had originally built this brand after 
working on metal of honor because they 

432
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,490
built up metal of honor and then that 
didn't work out for a number of reasons.

433
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:26,900
You can look all this up.
They built the call of duty brand up and

434
00:16:26,901 --> 00:16:30,260
then basically a modern warfare hit,
made a ton of money.

435
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,600
They basically didn't see much of it and
then they were like,

436
00:16:32,601 --> 00:16:33,800
screw you,
we're going to go do our own thing.

437
00:16:33,801 --> 00:16:38,801
It's a very controversial thing with a 
lot of lawsuits and everything like 

438
00:16:38,801 --> 00:16:38,801
that.
Um,

439
00:16:38,801 --> 00:16:42,130
I just,
I stayed on the site generally that the 

440
00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:42,130
developers,
because I believe in developers,

441
00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:45,161
riots,
I believe paying people what they're 

442
00:16:45,161 --> 00:16:46,421
worth.
And when you create a multimillion 

443
00:16:46,421 --> 00:16:46,421
dollar to potentially billion dollar 
brand,

444
00:16:46,421 --> 00:16:46,421
you deserve to be paid for it.
Right?

445
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:49,670
So the issue is that the people that 
finance it or getting the majority of

446
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:52,250
about the large studio,
uh,

447
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:54,480
uh,
activision basically,

448
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:56,760
from what I can tell again,
this is secondhand knowledge.

449
00:16:56,761 --> 00:17:01,761
You know,
the guys basically did not feel that 

450
00:17:01,761 --> 00:17:02,340
they were paid what we're worth for 
because when they have contracts,

451
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:05,460
once your studio is purchased and you're
part of a larger conglomerate,

452
00:17:05,461 --> 00:17:07,780
your game can make a billion dollars and
they could just give your studio,

453
00:17:07,781 --> 00:17:08,700
have half a million,
it'd be like,

454
00:17:08,701 --> 00:17:09,450
fine,
we own you,

455
00:17:09,451 --> 00:17:10,470
like whatever,
like,

456
00:17:10,471 --> 00:17:12,210
yeah,
and I don't know what the numbers are,

457
00:17:12,211 --> 00:17:14,820
but you're increasingly seeing in the 
video game industry,

458
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:17,820
people getting a lot of representation,
people getting a agents,

459
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:20,610
they're people you know,
getting a proper accountants and lawyers

460
00:17:20,611 --> 00:17:22,230
and they're actually negotiating this 
sort of thing.

461
00:17:22,231 --> 00:17:23,310
So,
you know,

462
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:25,770
people like Warren Spector,
her created Datastax,

463
00:17:25,771 --> 00:17:27,810
people like Ken Levine who created 
bioshock.

464
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:30,450
They've got deals now.
They're making amazing games and they're

465
00:17:30,451 --> 00:17:32,580
going to make sure that they and their 
staff are taking good care of.

466
00:17:32,581 --> 00:17:32,820
Right.

467
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:36,110
I remember back in the day when,
uh,

468
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:41,180
John Ramirez,
it was broke off from id software and 

469
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:44,451
that was like the first drama in the 
game community that this Guy John 

470
00:17:44,451 --> 00:17:45,540
Romero,
who's the game designer splits from this

471
00:17:45,541 --> 00:17:50,541
Guy John Carmack,
who's this fucking super from another 

472
00:17:50,541 --> 00:17:50,541
planet

473
00:17:50,541 --> 00:17:51,300
wizard guy.
Yeah.

474
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,640
He's the one of very few dudes.
When I'm around them,

475
00:17:53,641 --> 00:17:55,020
I get intimidated.
Yeah.

476
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,820
Like when I'm talking to John Carmack,
I'm like,

477
00:17:56,821 --> 00:18:00,180
why am I even talking about talking to 
this guy?

478
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:01,890
Did you ever fucking alien?
Yeah.

479
00:18:01,891 --> 00:18:05,490
Same sort of thing.
This whole lake one in a billion type of

480
00:18:05,491 --> 00:18:08,340
personality genius alien do right.
Like it's amazing.

481
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:13,520
I thought another level than all of us 
and carmax would sit in front of the 

482
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:13,520
computer for people who don't know who 
he is,

483
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:17,870
16 hours a day code and then he would go
make rocket scientist in his spare time.

484
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:25,840
Right.
It was involved with the x prize and I 

485
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:25,840
was like trying to win the x prize.
That's his hobby.

486
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,500
And when he wasn't doing that,
he was turbo charging Ferrari's,

487
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,580
building turbo charges for Ferrari.
It's a big no,

488
00:18:29,581 --> 00:18:30,380
no,
by the way,

489
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,570
right there,
like if it's like,

490
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:33,720
it's like buying a Mona Lisa and just 
painting over it,

491
00:18:33,721 --> 00:18:34,000
right?

492
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:39,180
Yes.
But he just doesn't have no reverence 

493
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:39,180
for any objects.
He's like,

494
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:42,021
fuck you.
But it has an alien with the rumor was 

495
00:18:42,021 --> 00:18:42,990
that like after he started doing that,
that Ferrari kind of was like,

496
00:18:42,991 --> 00:18:43,410
dude,
what are you?

497
00:18:43,411 --> 00:18:48,411
Come on,
like we're undermining all of our 

498
00:18:48,411 --> 00:18:48,411
engineers here.
You,

499
00:18:48,411 --> 00:18:48,670
our,
he still fucking with that shit.

500
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:53,880
He was making like these 12,000
horsepower Ferrari's fucking nuclear 

501
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:54,730
energy die.
Oh,

502
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:59,780
for sure.
Well he apparently was really nutty 

503
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:02,020
thrill seeker.
He used to really like to go really 

504
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:02,020
fast,
which is.

505
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:04,571
Yeah.
What happened was we cannot expect he 

506
00:19:04,571 --> 00:19:04,571
left id software.
The guys that do do this.

507
00:19:04,571 --> 00:19:04,571
John Romero guy to get back to this 
story.

508
00:19:04,571 --> 00:19:09,490
This guy was like the playboy character.
It was like rock docstar and you know,

509
00:19:10,381 --> 00:19:15,381
and then they left.
And what was that crazy game that they 

510
00:19:15,381 --> 00:19:17,841
came out with afterwards when they did 
an acronym and diatonic diatonic that 

511
00:19:17,841 --> 00:19:17,841
was the one.

512
00:19:17,841 --> 00:19:19,580
So they.
So he leaves and you know,

513
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:21,720
it was like sort of a cult of 
personality thing.

514
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:22,830
Oh yeah.
There was.

515
00:19:22,831 --> 00:19:25,740
The big debate was who was the most 
important,

516
00:19:25,741 --> 00:19:30,741
is that the game designers have a guy 
with the vision or is it the coder and 

517
00:19:30,741 --> 00:19:31,020
how easy it is to actually design the 
games.

518
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:36,320
The game designers often the chaos and 
the programmer or producers usually the 

519
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:36,320
order,
right.

520
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,730
It's a combination of those two persons 
saying what's the best part of the band?

521
00:19:38,731 --> 00:19:43,731
Is it the singers and the drummers get.
If you get the singer who could be on 

522
00:19:43,731 --> 00:19:43,731
stage and be charismatic,
you know,

523
00:19:43,731 --> 00:19:45,090
you get David Lee Roth but you don't 
have Eddie van Halen backing them up.

524
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,560
Right.
You don't have the magic.

525
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:48,480
Right.
And the example,

526
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:52,560
he wasn't in Van Halen on his own,
on his own.

527
00:19:52,561 --> 00:19:53,960
It was just David Lee Roth.
He's gone,

528
00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:55,770
he's doing some cool stuff now.

529
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:56,730
Man.
He's great.

530
00:19:56,731 --> 00:19:57,900
He's a great guy.
I've met him.

531
00:19:57,901 --> 00:20:00,030
I met him at the comedy store,
was one of the fucking coolest celebrity

532
00:20:00,031 --> 00:20:02,140
meetings I've ever had ever.
But my point was that,

533
00:20:02,141 --> 00:20:03,660
you know,
as a group,

534
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:08,840
you know,
those guys created some pretty fucking 

535
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:08,840
dope games,
doom,

536
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:09,150
doom,
they created as a group.

537
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:11,060
And the idea was that it was all this 
guys.

538
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:14,130
So this guy leaves and he gets this 
giant fucking deal.

539
00:20:14,131 --> 00:20:16,680
Is John Romero,
did you visit the Dallas Office?

540
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:18,030
No,
but I heard it was insane.

541
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:21,870
It was like the top floor with a 
unbelievable views.

542
00:20:21,871 --> 00:20:24,540
Just stupid,
crazy overhead.

543
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:29,541
Right?
This is legendary gaming history you're 

544
00:20:29,541 --> 00:20:29,541
talking about.
Yeah,

545
00:20:29,541 --> 00:20:32,241
yeah.
Well this is how much of a Dork I am 

546
00:20:32,241 --> 00:20:32,241
about this shit.
And um,

547
00:20:32,241 --> 00:20:32,241
he uh,
he gets crazy,

548
00:20:32,241 --> 00:20:35,970
crazy money and then to just lazy as 
fuck and they just barely working,

549
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:36,360
man.

550
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,240
This game like takes forever to come 
out.

551
00:20:39,241 --> 00:20:42,030
It comes out all wonky and shit.
And you walk through walls.

552
00:20:42,031 --> 00:20:43,700
That's an abbreviated version man.
But I mean,

553
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:44,490
the thing is,
is he,

554
00:20:44,491 --> 00:20:48,460
he assembled a team so fucking fast and 
try to be so ambitious so quick.

555
00:20:48,461 --> 00:20:53,461
And that was with [inaudible] money.
This is basically the Lara Croft tomb 

556
00:20:53,461 --> 00:20:53,461
raider paying for this.
Right?

557
00:20:53,461 --> 00:20:54,880
And so once you build a team that 
quickly,

558
00:20:54,881 --> 00:20:56,740
like you can't just overnight assemble a
bunch of people,

559
00:20:56,741 --> 00:20:58,570
I can Hollywood and have magic,
right?

560
00:20:58,571 --> 00:20:59,920
And so half,
not half,

561
00:20:59,921 --> 00:21:01,270
but a good percentage of the guys I work
with,

562
00:21:01,271 --> 00:21:03,790
my fucking art director,
who's this amazingly talented,

563
00:21:03,791 --> 00:21:06,260
awesome guy,
bled out of the eyeballs to ship.

564
00:21:06,261 --> 00:21:11,261
I katata he went to work for mirror 
because he thought Ramiro was a cool 

565
00:21:11,261 --> 00:21:14,401
guy,
but he still tells me stories about 

566
00:21:14,401 --> 00:21:15,060
having panic attacks in Dallas and how 
he almost killed himself to Christ.

567
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:18,430
And so like I always look at that and 
realize how much you guys work dude.

568
00:21:18,431 --> 00:21:20,080
It's like if you look around the room,
right?

569
00:21:20,081 --> 00:21:25,081
Every little bit,
somebody has to work and build every 

570
00:21:25,081 --> 00:21:25,630
last little bit of it.
When we visited you and you were talking

571
00:21:25,631 --> 00:21:30,631
about when crunch time comes into,
it's like right at the end and 

572
00:21:30,631 --> 00:21:30,970
everybody's like basically sleeping at 
the office.

573
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:33,190
That's all you do is you work with all 
dense.

574
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:38,260
Gotten better than that with like we've,
we figured out how to make games better 

575
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:41,161
now.
Like you get a producer who knows his 

576
00:21:41,161 --> 00:21:41,161
shit and it's kind of like,
okay,

577
00:21:41,161 --> 00:21:41,161
we're not just gonna all work really 
hard to hope it turns out great.

578
00:21:41,161 --> 00:21:42,280
We're going to actually have a plan.
Right?

579
00:21:42,281 --> 00:21:47,281
So if you say when it's done,
that doesn't mean you really know what 

580
00:21:47,281 --> 00:21:47,281
game you're building.
At the same time,

581
00:21:47,281 --> 00:21:48,130
you need to have a little bit of wiggle 
room because it's not.

582
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,920
It's not a like a a definable process.
You're,

583
00:21:50,921 --> 00:21:52,060
you're,
you're panning for gold,

584
00:21:52,061 --> 00:21:52,810
you're trying.
It's comedy.

585
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:53,950
I like comedy.
You iterate,

586
00:21:53,951 --> 00:21:55,930
right?
It's so comprehensive though.

587
00:21:55,931 --> 00:22:00,931
I mean people don't understand what goes
into making a game that just the amount 

588
00:22:00,931 --> 00:22:04,531
of effort.
I remember we were exhausted leaving 

589
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:04,570
thinking about the hours that you guys 
work,

590
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:06,640
but remember we were talking about it,
but dude,

591
00:22:06,641 --> 00:22:08,170
you can't burn through people that much.
Right?

592
00:22:08,171 --> 00:22:09,820
You could maybe get away with a few 
crunches like that.

593
00:22:09,821 --> 00:22:12,250
So we're the point where it will do 
maybe 10 hours a day,

594
00:22:12,251 --> 00:22:14,350
12 tops,
five days a week tops,

595
00:22:14,351 --> 00:22:14,870
and then we,
we,

596
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:15,730
we call it.
We're like,

597
00:22:15,731 --> 00:22:17,560
dude,
if we just say it's not worth it,

598
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:18,340
be smart.
You know,

599
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:21,390
because we're over 40 dude.
Yeah.

600
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:22,720
They just got fried,
right?

601
00:22:22,721 --> 00:22:24,160
Yeah.
Yeah.

602
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:29,250
That's interesting.
I'll tell you about that dike atonic 

603
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:29,250
thing though,
even though it was like a long time.

604
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:29,410
It was a fun game to play.
Man.

605
00:22:29,411 --> 00:22:32,830
Deathmatch deathmatch was fun on it.
They had some cool to cool rocket,

606
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:37,060
crazy weird rocket launcher.
They haven't had a shotgun that had like

607
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:39,430
18 barrels or something like that.
It was.

608
00:22:39,431 --> 00:22:40,810
They had some cool shit.
You know,

609
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:44,410
Romero was like supposedly like he was 
into first person shooters and death.

610
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:45,550
Magical.
It was him.

611
00:22:45,551 --> 00:22:48,550
It was him in Carmel and that whole crew
that just birthed the genre.

612
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:51,490
It's one of the lessons I tell the guys,
if you have a new camera angle,

613
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:56,670
you can create a whole new genre.
The first quake was a fucking 

614
00:22:56,670 --> 00:22:58,000
masterpiece for like death match.
Brian says you're still hung up on it.

615
00:22:58,030 --> 00:23:00,160
Oh,
well I'm still hung up on all games,

616
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:03,160
but not really quick to quick to never 
really got me.

617
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:08,340
But quake one dude.
The only thing that got me about quick 

618
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:08,340
too,
as the rail gun,

619
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:08,340
that was very key because when.

620
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:09,410
That's when accuracy,
it became very.

621
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:12,190
You know what your problem,
the fact that with quake two to actually

622
00:23:12,191 --> 00:23:13,900
balanced the weapons.
No,

623
00:23:13,901 --> 00:23:16,000
no,
I just didn't like the way it felt.

624
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:18,310
It just didn't feel as good.
It wasn't as fast paced.

625
00:23:18,311 --> 00:23:20,170
It was a little slower.
Whereas quake one,

626
00:23:20,171 --> 00:23:23,340
you can move much quicker.
It was much more like chaotic place.

627
00:23:23,341 --> 00:23:28,341
The numbers,
it has to be point seven seconds or 

628
00:23:28,341 --> 00:23:31,440
less.
What it is is that I just really love 

629
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:31,540
death match.
That's what I really love.

630
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:33,670
That's all I played in college.
A team death match.

631
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,980
Like anytime it comes up with any sort 
of domination and CTF,

632
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:41,040
might I just want to shoot people.
How do you feel about those things that 

633
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,130
hook up to a console and give you a 
mouse and a keyboard of those good.

634
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:44,050
I mean they're,
they're cool and all.

635
00:23:44,051 --> 00:23:45,860
But do you.
I mean the thing about halo is

636
00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:51,080
they built the game of halo for that 
dual stick controller and if you're a pc

637
00:23:51,081 --> 00:23:56,081
guy is used to that level of accuracy.
It feels like you're like drunkenly 

638
00:23:56,081 --> 00:23:58,730
using like a rubber hose to a your car.
But if you build a game for it,

639
00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:00,260
it can work.
And that's what halo did.

640
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:02,060
Golden,
I did it before that.

641
00:24:02,061 --> 00:24:07,061
But you look at Halo,
they basically introduced a genre that 

642
00:24:07,061 --> 00:24:09,641
was new to a whole generation of kids.
I have this whole 10 year rule where 

643
00:24:09,641 --> 00:24:09,641
like the kids who played halo,
most of them,

644
00:24:09,641 --> 00:24:12,320
many of them didn't play a lot of quake 
because they're like,

645
00:24:12,321 --> 00:24:13,520
wait,
what does this new xbox thing?

646
00:24:13,521 --> 00:24:15,380
I'm gonna play this.
And then they become hooked.

647
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:20,590
It's like the.
We talked about vampires on the way 

648
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:20,590
over.
It's like,

649
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:23,170
okay,
well all these kids who love twilight 

650
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:23,170
don't know what buffy the vampire slayer
is.

651
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:24,170
So,
but if you wait 10 years,

652
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:29,171
right?
Your kid who liked buffy the vampire 

653
00:24:29,171 --> 00:24:29,171
slayer or you're a person who likes a 
twilight.

654
00:24:29,171 --> 00:24:30,080
They were what like,
you know,

655
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,510
six when buffy came out and now they're 
16.

656
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:34,040
And so they,
they didn't know about that.

657
00:24:34,041 --> 00:24:37,580
So you can basically wait every 10 years
and find something that was old and make

658
00:24:37,581 --> 00:24:42,581
it new.
And then if you can introduce it with 

659
00:24:42,581 --> 00:24:42,581
new technology,
you might be good to go.

660
00:24:42,581 --> 00:24:43,230
Yeah.
Um,

661
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,870
for people who don't know what we're 
talking about,

662
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:49,400
those a hand controllers,
the consoles,

663
00:24:49,401 --> 00:24:52,550
when you have a console,
you have xbox or playstation,

664
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:57,730
what they are,
that's most people are listening on 

665
00:24:57,730 --> 00:24:57,730
Itunes,
the same help,

666
00:24:57,730 --> 00:24:58,600
but he's holding one up but they have a 
bunch of buttons on it.

667
00:24:58,670 --> 00:25:00,050
And with,
with pcs,

668
00:25:00,051 --> 00:25:02,270
when you play with a computer,
when you play online,

669
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:07,300
especially your,
what you're using is a keyboard and the 

670
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:07,540
mouse and what it is is for whatever 
reason,

671
00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:09,980
the keyboard and the mouse,
you can just control it better.

672
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:13,190
You're far more accurate,
you're accurate with the keyboard as far

673
00:25:13,191 --> 00:25:15,830
as your movement,
having four very specific buttons,

674
00:25:15,831 --> 00:25:19,220
right where your fingers are and you're 
much more accurate with your hand as far

675
00:25:19,221 --> 00:25:24,221
as like aiming.
And that's where it came into play with 

676
00:25:24,221 --> 00:25:27,520
games like quake is like aim,
especially when the rail gun came about 

677
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:27,520
and became very,
very important.

678
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:30,920
So how do they optimize these games for 
these controls?

679
00:25:30,921 --> 00:25:33,470
Do they have auto aim or something?
You get close,

680
00:25:33,471 --> 00:25:34,950
you're in the neighborhood of it and 
it'll.

681
00:25:35,850 --> 00:25:40,850
There was one of the things that halo 
did was they kind of introduced this 

682
00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:41,530
idea of friction and adhesions,
so what you do is if you,

683
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:46,560
when you move your,
your console kind of stick over the 

684
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:49,231
enemy.
The game actually slows down a little 

685
00:25:49,231 --> 00:25:49,231
bit.
Like it's like,

686
00:25:49,231 --> 00:25:49,231
oh,
you want to hit them,

687
00:25:49,231 --> 00:25:53,011
don't you?
And then it provides a little bit of 

688
00:25:53,011 --> 00:25:53,011
that kind of assistance.
Right.

689
00:25:53,011 --> 00:25:54,070
That would drive me crazy.
Whole generation loves it right now.

690
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:56,490
Those fucks,
those lazy constant march what it is,

691
00:25:56,500 --> 00:26:01,500
they don't even want to aim these 
fucking kids that a self righteous and 

692
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:01,830
titled Children Back when we were 
acquired,

693
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:04,420
we aim.
It was a pixel.

694
00:26:04,421 --> 00:26:04,840
That dude,

695
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:05,860
that's what it was,
right?

696
00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:08,530
Your crosshair was this one pixel and 
you had to shoot.

697
00:26:08,531 --> 00:26:11,740
That guy's edbd had across the map,
except for in quake one where you had to

698
00:26:11,741 --> 00:26:14,140
just hit them with a rocket launcher.
The had radius of half a mile.

699
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:19,350
That was the cool thing about quick too 
is a lot of people would put their own 

700
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:19,350
crosshairs in.
They would build their own cross hairs,

701
00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:21,220
but quick three that came out of the 
box,

702
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:22,480
like a bunch of cool ones,
you know,

703
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:23,980
like figure out what was the best for 
you.

704
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,980
Like I would have different ones for the
rail gun,

705
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:27,710
different ones for the rocket launcher.
It's all.

706
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:30,340
It's all customization,
but it's insanity is what it is.

707
00:26:30,341 --> 00:26:35,341
I can't.
It's a constant subject on this fucking 

708
00:26:35,341 --> 00:26:35,341
side.
Do you trust the pots or whatever it is?

709
00:26:35,341 --> 00:26:39,891
Millions and millions of kids that are 
perfectly fine with the two sticks and 

710
00:26:39,891 --> 00:26:39,891
they're going to grow up pussies.
We are.

711
00:26:39,891 --> 00:26:44,070
We're entering what I like to say,
we're entering into the feedback list 

712
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:44,070
generation,
right?

713
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:44,070
Those kids growing up

714
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:45,840
with those consoles,
this is the last,

715
00:26:45,841 --> 00:26:50,841
the fall of Rome.
This was when they were getting drunk 

716
00:26:50,841 --> 00:26:52,080
and throwing up and trying to get more 
food in that sort of is gluttony.

717
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:54,090
He touched him.
Joe,

718
00:26:54,091 --> 00:26:55,320
look at touch screens.
Look at,

719
00:26:55,350 --> 00:27:00,350
look at connect.
We're getting to a point where people 

720
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:00,350
don't need buttons right now,
which you,

721
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:01,950
right?
Is that what's going to happen?

722
00:27:01,951 --> 00:27:03,420
Is it going to be like gaming with your 
fingers and.

723
00:27:03,421 --> 00:27:07,560
Shit like pointing where you want to do 
the Microsoft thing is Ryan,

724
00:27:07,561 --> 00:27:08,410
isn't it?
That's.

725
00:27:08,411 --> 00:27:09,870
Yeah,
that's what is that called?

726
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:11,420
Connect men connect.
Yeah.

727
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:16,430
You don't need a controller and you.
You stand in front of it and move 

728
00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:16,590
around.
I guess you haven't.

729
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:18,750
Have you heard much about this?
This is not that much.

730
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:24,140
I know this is going to trip you out,
so it's a camera that can track your 

731
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:24,960
body movements without anything on you.

732
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,430
You've seen the motion capture systems,
right?

733
00:27:26,431 --> 00:27:28,440
You know the type that would set up with
whereas a spandex and all that.

734
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:33,650
This is a very light version of that 
where you just stand in front of the TV 

735
00:27:33,650 --> 00:27:34,500
and it can procedurally form your 
skeleton and then track that.

736
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,630
So there's a dance game.
Dance Central,

737
00:27:36,631 --> 00:27:41,631
which is a ton of fun.
Just playing with my niece over the 

738
00:27:41,631 --> 00:27:43,341
holidays.
You literally just dance right in front 

739
00:27:43,341 --> 00:27:43,341
of it attracts your movement.
It can judge your score.

740
00:27:43,341 --> 00:27:44,130
Here's where it gets weird.
There is a video,

741
00:27:44,131 --> 00:27:49,131
like a microphone on it so it can do 
voice recognition and it's got facial 

742
00:27:49,131 --> 00:27:53,421
recognition on it.
So once you do the facial recognition 

743
00:27:53,421 --> 00:27:56,871
thing,
which makes you stay out of the room to 

744
00:27:56,871 --> 00:27:56,871
kind of build an aggregate of your face,
it,

745
00:27:56,871 --> 00:27:57,510
you then can just walk in the room.
It goes,

746
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:58,560
why hello cliff,
look,

747
00:27:58,561 --> 00:28:02,700
oh Jesus fucking Christ.
I smoke too much weed for that dude.

748
00:28:02,701 --> 00:28:05,220
I don't want my computer talking to me.
You know what I want to see.

749
00:28:05,221 --> 00:28:10,221
I want to see imax movies like screens 
like where you walk in and you're all 

750
00:28:10,221 --> 00:28:15,111
sitting there in the video game.
So there's like 500 people all joining 

751
00:28:15,111 --> 00:28:16,560
in plain.
This huge video game

752
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:21,580
in front of you,
like I told you about from doing 

753
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:21,640
standup.
He said,

754
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:25,820
my friend John [inaudible] has been 
doing these conference stand up.

755
00:28:25,821 --> 00:28:30,821
Things were there in front of it,
some new technology where they get them 

756
00:28:30,821 --> 00:28:32,990
in a room and he's got all these screens
in front of them and they see him and he

757
00:28:32,991 --> 00:28:35,220
sees them live and he does standup.
Really?

758
00:28:35,221 --> 00:28:40,221
He's like,
he's doing a desk in front of like all 

759
00:28:40,221 --> 00:28:40,800
these monitors.
So he gets to see the reaction like yes,

760
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:43,010
two way video.
So he's watching the reaction.

761
00:28:43,011 --> 00:28:45,620
They're watching him live,
it's like he's performing on stage,

762
00:28:45,621 --> 00:28:48,170
but he's nowhere near that.
We're talking the shit.

763
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:51,500
I would love that if I could do shows 
from my house and not have to travel all

764
00:28:51,501 --> 00:28:52,230
the time.
That was good.

765
00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:53,540
You Judge People's reactions,
right?

766
00:28:53,541 --> 00:28:55,570
I mean that's what we're talking about 
iteration,

767
00:28:55,571 --> 00:29:00,571
right,
and how much we panned for gold and we 

768
00:29:00,571 --> 00:29:00,571
try and find fun and we fail a bunch 
before we figured out what it is.

769
00:29:00,571 --> 00:29:01,600
I mean,
talk about Jerry Seinfeld's comedian,

770
00:29:01,601 --> 00:29:04,270
how much comedy they.
They go to the little dive bars and they

771
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:07,300
do a surprise appearance and they just 
bomb and then they figure out,

772
00:29:07,301 --> 00:29:08,230
okay,
this joke work.

773
00:29:08,231 --> 00:29:09,370
That one didn't work,
this one did.

774
00:29:09,371 --> 00:29:09,650
Right?
It's,

775
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:11,710
we find it's the same thing with game 
development.

776
00:29:11,870 --> 00:29:13,990
I know people in the restaurant business
that try new menus,

777
00:29:13,991 --> 00:29:15,710
they figure out what works and does it.
It's all iteration.

778
00:29:15,711 --> 00:29:20,711
Nobody.
Very few people ever actually nail it 

779
00:29:20,711 --> 00:29:20,711
right the first time.
Right.

780
00:29:20,711 --> 00:29:24,080
We'll fail early and fail often,
which I found is the key to so many 

781
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:24,080
instances of success in life.
Right?

782
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:27,890
Well,
you fail and then you find out what you 

783
00:29:27,890 --> 00:29:27,890
don't like about what failed.
Yep.

784
00:29:27,890 --> 00:29:27,890
No,
and that's how you learn.

785
00:29:27,890 --> 00:29:32,750
Absolutely.
You have to learn what you do and don't 

786
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:32,750
like and when you're doing something 
complicated,

787
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:32,820
there's a lot of failure involved.
For sure.

788
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:34,270
Keyboard man.
It's a,

789
00:29:34,271 --> 00:29:39,271
it's still relevant but you know,
it's the market split between fall 

790
00:29:39,271 --> 00:29:43,420
between des,
between like I see no controller is very

791
00:29:43,421 --> 00:29:46,150
important.
I think like making it so it could be,

792
00:29:46,151 --> 00:29:51,151
you could do just sit there and do that.
What I don't like though is when a lot 

793
00:29:51,151 --> 00:29:54,961
of times I just want to sit back and 
play a video game in bed or I'm just 

794
00:29:56,291 --> 00:29:58,080
trying to run through the forest.
I don't,

795
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:00,870
you don't want to sweat,
you don't,

796
00:30:00,871 --> 00:30:05,871
you just want to,
you want to lay back and just sit there 

797
00:30:05,871 --> 00:30:05,871
with the controller display,
right?

798
00:30:05,871 --> 00:30:05,871
You don't have to jump around like an 
idiot.

799
00:30:05,871 --> 00:30:07,030
Right.
I sit here and go like this though,

800
00:30:07,031 --> 00:30:09,290
like tron style and just move my hands 
like Doo Doo.

801
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:14,310
I'm going through.
When they're working on type stuff like 

802
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:14,310
minority report,
where are you gonna?

803
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:15,030
Be able to just keep it like that so you
don't have to like mark.

804
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:17,170
There's a certain percentage of person,
a lot of them out there,

805
00:30:17,171 --> 00:30:22,171
especially girls.
If you handled the current console 

806
00:30:22,171 --> 00:30:24,181
controller,
they act like you handed them a flaming 

807
00:30:24,181 --> 00:30:24,181
bag of dog shit.
Right?

808
00:30:24,181 --> 00:30:24,670
Like really?
I'm supposed to use this for what?

809
00:30:24,671 --> 00:30:27,340
Like I don't want to play this and 
granted there are some exceptions,

810
00:30:27,341 --> 00:30:30,690
but most people,
parents like you're met with cliff.

811
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:32,670
He being.
That's a year old girl voice.

812
00:30:32,671 --> 00:30:33,310
That was a nine.

813
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:38,340
That's your becky voice.
Oh my God.

814
00:30:38,410 --> 00:30:39,220
Yeah,
exactly.

815
00:30:39,930 --> 00:30:42,180
And it's such an asshole.
He is play a game.

816
00:30:42,530 --> 00:30:44,240
The.
We have this whole theory that there's a

817
00:30:44,241 --> 00:30:49,241
certain type of girl that somehow gets 
that voice preloaded into her with that 

818
00:30:49,241 --> 00:30:53,021
bubbled writing.
I think they just imitate everybody 

819
00:30:53,021 --> 00:30:53,021
else.
It's like,

820
00:30:53,021 --> 00:30:55,390
why?
Why would anybody have that fucking 

821
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:55,390
horrible Boston accent?
Why?

822
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:56,360
Because a bunch of other people have and
they just imitate it still.

823
00:30:56,570 --> 00:30:57,500
I still miss it though,
Dude.

824
00:30:58,070 --> 00:30:59,600
Do you really?
How dare you,

825
00:30:59,870 --> 00:31:00,460
dude.
I agree.

826
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:03,650
I had a great time growing up.
I miss it with as far as dudes.

827
00:31:03,690 --> 00:31:08,690
You know,
you don't like the girls know Jesus 

828
00:31:08,690 --> 00:31:11,050
Christ.
Some of the most horrendous experiences 

829
00:31:11,050 --> 00:31:11,050
in my life came out of a female Boston 
accent.

830
00:31:11,050 --> 00:31:13,280
Yeah,
get some.

831
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,880
Just gets too cold.
Yeah.

832
00:31:16,050 --> 00:31:20,390
We had this experience where a buddy of 
a buddy of ours was in Boston.

833
00:31:20,410 --> 00:31:22,330
He hooked up with some chicken while 
they're fooling around.

834
00:31:22,331 --> 00:31:25,070
She goes,
he tell you friends,

835
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:31,420
wait a monster sound.
It was just hideous and he just fucking 

836
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:31,720
swinging it.
And I got a buddy of mine.

837
00:31:31,721 --> 00:31:36,721
He dated a girl from Long Island and 
they woke up the next morning and he 

838
00:31:36,721 --> 00:31:36,820
asked her what she wanted for breakfast 
and see what count.

839
00:31:36,821 --> 00:31:41,821
Chocula dude.
So I took Lauren back to see my 

840
00:31:42,311 --> 00:31:43,510
hometown.
Right.

841
00:31:43,511 --> 00:31:46,170
Like I had to blackboard.
What town did you grow up with that over

842
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:47,040
north andover?
Yeah.

843
00:31:47,050 --> 00:31:49,060
I mean it's totally like Nice suburbs,
right?

844
00:31:49,061 --> 00:31:50,340
Like really?
Like we went up in the fall,

845
00:31:50,341 --> 00:31:51,460
false.
All the foliage,

846
00:31:51,461 --> 00:31:53,980
like the local farm standard.
Rob is a kid is like this now,

847
00:31:53,981 --> 00:31:55,420
like national.
What month was this?

848
00:31:55,930 --> 00:31:58,330
Was October.
Late October is good.

849
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:00,250
Was right before it gets horrible,
horrible,

850
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:05,280
horrible.
And I'm sitting there and there's 

851
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:07,591
something about certain sections of the 
northeast that just kind of take 

852
00:32:07,591 --> 00:32:07,591
something out of you.

853
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,880
I don't know if it's the Diet or the 
weather,

854
00:32:10,150 --> 00:32:12,100
but there's a certain tiredness that 
kind of creeps in.

855
00:32:12,101 --> 00:32:13,150
Man.
I don't know what it is.

856
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:17,680
Lack of vitamin D to lack of vitamin D.
But there's something about the weather.

857
00:32:17,681 --> 00:32:19,960
You know,
Italian food cold.

858
00:32:19,961 --> 00:32:24,961
Yeah.
It's not supposed to be that cold for 

859
00:32:24,961 --> 00:32:24,961
that long.
We're just sucks.

860
00:32:24,961 --> 00:32:26,230
Well,
you just assume that every year for four

861
00:32:26,231 --> 00:32:28,990
months it's going to suck to be outside.
But I grew up.

862
00:32:29,130 --> 00:32:29,920
You grew up with it,
right?

863
00:32:29,921 --> 00:32:32,410
Like I grew up and I had to get my.
I do a paper route as a kid.

864
00:32:32,411 --> 00:32:33,280
Right.
Me Too.

865
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:35,440
And they deliver it and they deliver it 
in like a.

866
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,760
They deliver the papers.
In November,

867
00:32:36,761 --> 00:32:38,440
the snow would hit and I'd get up at 
10:00

868
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:41,330
AM to do my paper and the,
the it all be plowed over it.

869
00:32:41,331 --> 00:32:41,570
And I have.

870
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,620
My papers aren't there.
I'm like,

871
00:32:42,621 --> 00:32:46,040
I guess they didn't deliver my calling 
for a refill sometime around late March,

872
00:32:46,041 --> 00:32:48,200
early April.
That would thaw out and I would find the

873
00:32:48,201 --> 00:32:51,740
papers for March,
like a time capsule and I'm sitting here

874
00:32:51,741 --> 00:32:52,550
going,
is this how it is?

875
00:32:52,551 --> 00:32:57,551
Because my dad loved him dearly but he 
was super cheap about the heat and he'd 

876
00:32:57,551 --> 00:33:01,191
like it 90 turn off and like in the 
Monday morning getting up and going to 

877
00:33:01,191 --> 00:33:01,191
school.
Oh,

878
00:33:01,191 --> 00:33:03,080
it's the worst.
Like getting into that shower man.

879
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:08,140
Oh,
we used to have to use a hairdryer to 

880
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:09,380
unf on clog the pipes.
The pipes would freeze.

881
00:33:09,410 --> 00:33:14,410
Yep.
So my dad had like this opening 

882
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:16,630
underneath the floor in the basement and
he would have to lift up this opening 

883
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:19,960
and it'd be sitting there with a fucking
hairdryer before anybody could take a 

884
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:20,360
shower.
But we retaliate who's retarded?

885
00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:25,390
We grew up,
my dad decided one year he was going to 

886
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:25,390
buy a coal stove that was going to like 
take care of all this.

887
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:29,741
Right.
So he gets it installed and literally 

888
00:33:29,741 --> 00:33:29,920
like a one folly as two tons of coal 
put,

889
00:33:29,930 --> 00:33:31,370
like put it in the basement.
Right.

890
00:33:31,670 --> 00:33:36,670
And we literally have to go down there 
with a hopper and like bring it up 

891
00:33:36,670 --> 00:33:36,670
there.
And you have to hold your breath,

892
00:33:36,670 --> 00:33:39,701
otherwise you get black lung basically.
And we come up and like this thing he 

893
00:33:39,701 --> 00:33:39,701
did like two square feet of the whole 
house.

894
00:33:39,701 --> 00:33:44,620
So if you want it to stay warm,
you stayed in the living room and just 

895
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:45,140
hovered right in front of that thing.
Oh yeah.

896
00:33:45,141 --> 00:33:46,400
We had four.
I got four of the brothers,

897
00:33:46,401 --> 00:33:47,660
man,
I've grown up with that in one house and

898
00:33:47,661 --> 00:33:49,490
it was a decent size house.
But one of the.

899
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:51,050
What's that?
I'm sorry.

900
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:53,600
I had central air.
You're spoiled.

901
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:55,640
How old are you?
What do you like?

902
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:59,320
Fuck is wrong with you.
Shit.

903
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:04,330
Huh?
One of the houses I looked at in 

904
00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:05,861
Colorado had one of those wood heating 
stove in the middle of the living room 

905
00:34:05,861 --> 00:34:08,810
and they were talking about how 
economical it is to use this wood 

906
00:34:08,810 --> 00:34:08,810
heating stove to keep the house warm.
I'm like,

907
00:34:08,810 --> 00:34:10,280
what are you fucking talking about?
Hooker?

908
00:34:10,281 --> 00:34:15,281
I got kids and you've got a giant red 
hot ball of metal and the center of the 

909
00:34:15,281 --> 00:34:16,130
living room,
but they're just supposed to avoid.

910
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:19,040
Dude.
I used to say I was a kid.

911
00:34:19,041 --> 00:34:24,041
I used to take prongs with the hot coals
and take them out aside from the living 

912
00:34:24,041 --> 00:34:24,980
room,
like through the hallway and go into the

913
00:34:24,981 --> 00:34:29,981
snow,
like write my name with a blazing hot 

914
00:34:29,981 --> 00:34:32,171
cold.
Like how did that not like drop this on 

915
00:34:32,171 --> 00:34:32,171
my foot and burn myself.

916
00:34:32,171 --> 00:34:32,171
Right.
I don't know.

917
00:34:32,171 --> 00:34:35,211
But in 2010 they should eliminate that 
stupid shit and get a God damn heater 

918
00:34:35,211 --> 00:34:39,500
when you've got a fucking giant cast 
iron fucking in the middle of the rope.

919
00:34:39,501 --> 00:34:41,770
That was not common at all.
Well you guys are talking about like,

920
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:45,470
I didn't know anybody that had columbus 
gets pretty cold though.

921
00:34:45,490 --> 00:34:49,970
Man didn't have central heat or air.
They're like,

922
00:34:49,971 --> 00:34:50,960
dude,
what is this lake?

923
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:55,220
The technology I guess can old heating 
and cooling in Ohio was better than.

924
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:59,510
Well No,
Columbus doesn't get death cold though.

925
00:34:59,511 --> 00:34:59,990
Right?
What is,

926
00:34:59,991 --> 00:35:04,991
what is winter?
What is it like a terrible January got 

927
00:35:04,991 --> 00:35:05,420
negative 10.
That's the real shit.

928
00:35:05,450 --> 00:35:06,170
That's cool.
So yeah,

929
00:35:06,171 --> 00:35:07,280
I grew up with who are brothers,
right?

930
00:35:07,281 --> 00:35:12,281
And we had to share a lot of shit.
And so like we have to share towels in 

931
00:35:12,281 --> 00:35:12,281
the bathroom.
We only had a certain amount,

932
00:35:12,281 --> 00:35:12,950
we all took the golden lion and take 
showers.

933
00:35:12,950 --> 00:35:17,950
Right,
and I'm sitting there one day and I get 

934
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:19,691
out of the shower after my older brother
and I take the towel and I'm kind of 

935
00:35:19,691 --> 00:35:22,960
wipe my face and it's a light color 
towel and I realized the towels smells 

936
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,470
like ass.
Oh Jesus Christ.

937
00:35:24,471 --> 00:35:27,890
I pull away and I'm telling this story 
to his daughter recently.

938
00:35:27,891 --> 00:35:32,891
She's like a little eight year old kid 
and her dad and I looked at the towel 

939
00:35:32,891 --> 00:35:32,891
and I realized there's Brown streaks in 
the towel.

940
00:35:32,891 --> 00:35:37,871
Oh my God.
This explaining to his daughter that 

941
00:35:37,871 --> 00:35:38,040
this is a double fail because not only 
did

942
00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:43,050
not remember to wash his ass,
like he forgot to like wipe right and 

943
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:44,940
asked my niece.
I'm like,

944
00:35:44,941 --> 00:35:45,630
what's the,
what's the,

945
00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:48,510
what's the lesson out of the story?
And she says by dark towels,

946
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:50,820
I'm like,
no,

947
00:35:50,821 --> 00:35:53,670
you're doing eight.
That's brilliant.

948
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:55,560
You're doing it wrong.
No,

949
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:58,850
that kid keep an ironer.
She's Brown and red towels.

950
00:35:59,310 --> 00:36:00,870
Ideal match for me.
That's.

951
00:36:00,871 --> 00:36:02,420
I would never thought of that in a 
million years.

952
00:36:02,421 --> 00:36:03,900
Have you seen that?
That's a great line.

953
00:36:04,010 --> 00:36:05,730
You understands the genes and true story
dude.

954
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:06,620
Great Line,
right?

955
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,000
They have to tell.
He can buy online.

956
00:36:08,010 --> 00:36:13,010
It's like one half is brown.
One half is a white and says face and 

957
00:36:13,010 --> 00:36:13,080
ass.
It's like a split title.

958
00:36:13,081 --> 00:36:18,081
I it in my bathroom was good reminder.
I would want a brown towel that looked 

959
00:36:18,081 --> 00:36:21,831
like,
like a dexter splatter of blood on it 

960
00:36:21,831 --> 00:36:24,890
and that was the design of the towel bar
that you can actually bite dexter is a 

961
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:26,760
shirt.
The kill a thermally.

962
00:36:26,770 --> 00:36:27,250
Where's?
Yeah.

963
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,540
Do you.
Did you do?

964
00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:30,000
Did you give up on Dexter Joe?

965
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:34,440
Mrs Rogan's really intuit though,
so I'm going to have to try again dude.

966
00:36:34,441 --> 00:36:37,710
Even though John Lithgow that quit 
because of John Lithgow,

967
00:36:37,711 --> 00:36:42,711
shitty rear naked choke,
John Lithgow get some woman getting her,

968
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:48,620
gave her the fucking weakest bitch as 
rear naked choke I've ever seen in my 

969
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:48,620
life.
I'm like,

970
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:49,020
no,
that's not going to kill anybody.

971
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:54,120
That's me stopping watching a TV show 
because they're holding the controller 

972
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:54,120
wrong.
When you try to kill people,

973
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:54,900
man,
they fight.

974
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,690
They fight back.
The cloche you,

975
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:58,230
they kicked,
they try hard.

976
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:01,850
They don't just lay in the tub and go 
while you're choking them.

977
00:37:01,990 --> 00:37:06,020
Your little fucking old man arms didn't 
even put any pressure on that thing.

978
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:08,210
Amazing that season,
dude.

979
00:37:08,211 --> 00:37:10,340
And you know welders on the season.
Have you seen him lately?

980
00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:12,980
He looks like the most.
I didn't even read that again.

981
00:37:13,010 --> 00:37:17,220
Who's a cop?
Robocop first.

982
00:37:18,410 --> 00:37:20,480
Rub it and you're just like,
oh my God,

983
00:37:20,481 --> 00:37:20,770
dude.
I don't know.

984
00:37:20,990 --> 00:37:22,790
He looks like the sleazy,
amazing.

985
00:37:22,791 --> 00:37:24,560
Like Miami pd guy.
He looks great.

986
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,050
It's still a good show in spite of the 
bad choke holds.

987
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:30,050
Okay,
well I'll give it a second chance.

988
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,280
Watch walking dead.
No,

989
00:37:31,281 --> 00:37:32,330
but I've heard.
That's pretty awesome.

990
00:37:32,610 --> 00:37:35,380
It's the end was a little bit,
but say that.

991
00:37:35,610 --> 00:37:40,610
Then I got nothing to look forward to.
Frank Darabont fire the entire writing 

992
00:37:40,610 --> 00:37:40,610
staff.
Whoa.

993
00:37:40,610 --> 00:37:40,610
Yeah.
He's a guy.

994
00:37:40,610 --> 00:37:41,720
He did shawshank redemption.
Green Mile.

995
00:37:41,721 --> 00:37:42,980
Right.
Wow.

996
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,830
Fired the whole staff.
It's hard to find fucking good writers.

997
00:37:45,831 --> 00:37:47,210
That one right.
Your Shit.

998
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:52,300
Yeah.
No good writers want to write their own 

999
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:52,300
shit.
Yeah.

1000
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:52,300
Well let's just say.
Well,

1001
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:52,300
I've had people approach me and they're 
like,

1002
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:53,950
hey,
we were doing this a dual ip and we want

1003
00:37:53,951 --> 00:37:55,150
epic to make the game.
I'm like,

1004
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:56,650
dude,
we do our own stuff,

1005
00:37:56,651 --> 00:38:01,651
man.
Like we can either create our own thing 

1006
00:38:01,651 --> 00:38:01,651
like years or we could do like the star 
trek movie video game.

1007
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:03,550
What's going to happen?
Right,

1008
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:05,810
right.
We're not going to run inspiring.

1009
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:08,110
Nobody gives a fuck about those stupid 
movie video.

1010
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:10,200
There's the occasional exception.
That's a good one,

1011
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:15,230
you know,
but it's hard to make like a superman 

1012
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:17,211
for the Nintendo 64 game.
Every etf for Atari to have my feet,

1013
00:38:17,551 --> 00:38:18,660
you know,
that's very desert,

1014
00:38:18,661 --> 00:38:20,650
right?
They actually,

1015
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:25,820
oh yeah,
that's one of the craziest stories and 

1016
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:25,820
urban legend story.
It was the,

1017
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:26,700
the video game,
right?

1018
00:38:26,701 --> 00:38:29,550
And the Atari Twenty 600 and they 
basically assumed it would sell millions

1019
00:38:29,551 --> 00:38:31,410
of copies and it sold like five.
Oh my goodness.

1020
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:34,050
Decided to like bury out in the New 
Mexico desert and they actually is still

1021
00:38:34,051 --> 00:38:35,350
out there.
They buried it,

1022
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:36,160
buried it.
Why

1023
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,550
did it?
Because I don't know.

1024
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:41,800
I guess they didn't confront somebody 
better and whatever disposal economics,

1025
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:47,820
huge landfill filled with that game and 
in fact many of them I don't actually 

1026
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:47,820
know that you can look it up and we'd 
meet.

1027
00:38:47,830 --> 00:38:49,740
What's the urban legend though?
Well,

1028
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:51,490
people think it's an urban legend,
but it's actually true,

1029
00:38:51,491 --> 00:38:53,380
but what is the number in the urban 
legend?

1030
00:38:53,410 --> 00:38:54,490
It's millions,
millions,

1031
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:56,130
millions because they hired some 
programmer.

1032
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:57,540
It had to make the game over the course 
of a month.

1033
00:38:57,770 --> 00:38:59,380
That's the license we can print.
It will make money,

1034
00:38:59,381 --> 00:39:00,280
right?
Like no,

1035
00:39:00,281 --> 00:39:05,281
you actually have to make a good game.
Like the new call of duty was done by 

1036
00:39:05,281 --> 00:39:07,921
the second team,
which previously had made a very solid 

1037
00:39:07,921 --> 00:39:11,221
one a couple of years ago and it had 
made a one a few years ago that wasn't 

1038
00:39:11,221 --> 00:39:11,221
as good,
but they have really stepped it up.

1039
00:39:11,221 --> 00:39:11,221
This new one.
It like,

1040
00:39:11,221 --> 00:39:12,160
I didn't even play the campaign,
man.

1041
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:13,150
You did.
You play it much?

1042
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:14,370
No,
I've never played it.

1043
00:39:14,530 --> 00:39:15,780
It's true.
You should give it a government.

1044
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:18,050
I know you have dual analog fear.
Can't do it.

1045
00:39:18,970 --> 00:39:21,530
You have to try.
You have to at least give him some time.

1046
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:24,160
What's going to happen with all the 
shooters are like emotional funnels.

1047
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:25,800
I guess I'll play pool.
You gotta.

1048
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:28,330
Imagine going like this and playing 
pool.

1049
00:39:28,331 --> 00:39:29,320
You don't even need a pool table.

1050
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:29,800
No,
no,

1051
00:39:29,801 --> 00:39:30,640
no.
You need a pool table,

1052
00:39:30,641 --> 00:39:31,660
bro.
That's the whole game.

1053
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:36,750
The whole game was.
Did any of them feel the ball contact 

1054
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:38,200
the queue?
It's either feel the ball and how much,

1055
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:40,330
how much effort you put into your 
stroke,

1056
00:39:40,331 --> 00:39:42,730
how relaxed your grip is.
Keep your shit together.

1057
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:49,280
It's kind of stroke that ball son.
You'll change the mind trying some 

1058
00:39:51,251 --> 00:39:52,420
different things.
All right.

1059
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:54,740
How do you do different things?
Uh,

1060
00:39:54,741 --> 00:39:55,700
I don't know.
It's Disney.

1061
00:39:55,701 --> 00:39:58,260
So it cost them 100.
And did,

1062
00:39:58,530 --> 00:40:03,530
did you move to 150 million?
Do you know the guy who directed it is 

1063
00:40:03,530 --> 00:40:03,530
the guy who did the first gears 
commercial?

1064
00:40:03,530 --> 00:40:04,460
The mad world one where really?
Yeah,

1065
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:07,520
that was a joke.
Fucking commercial was awesome.

1066
00:40:07,521 --> 00:40:09,880
It was.
I remember when that commercial was

1067
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:12,610
coming out before gears came out,
I saw it on tv and I went,

1068
00:40:12,611 --> 00:40:15,040
whoa.
Like they just nailed it.

1069
00:40:15,130 --> 00:40:20,130
It's a song as a perfect song to that 
song was actually one of my favorite 

1070
00:40:20,130 --> 00:40:24,331
songs,
but I was going through all that up on 

1071
00:40:24,331 --> 00:40:24,331
youtube,
right parental pull it up.

1072
00:40:24,331 --> 00:40:28,300
That was one of my,
like I was going through really tough 

1073
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:29,911
time at that point.
They actually didn't even know about 

1074
00:40:29,911 --> 00:40:29,911
that,
so why don't you just call me.

1075
00:40:29,911 --> 00:40:29,920
I would've snapped you out of it.
That's ridiculous.

1076
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:32,080
Don't listen to that kind of music when 
you that kind of mood.

1077
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:34,530
I was that movie.
That's a good song for

1078
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:35,710
good mood to go.
Wow.

1079
00:40:35,711 --> 00:40:40,711
That's kind of a cool song.
The last thing you want is when 

1080
00:40:40,711 --> 00:40:40,780
depressing ass fucking song when you're 
in a shit mood.

1081
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:43,150
You remember it was a remake of the 
tears for fears song,

1082
00:40:43,151 --> 00:40:44,170
right?
Is that what it is?

1083
00:40:44,171 --> 00:40:49,171
Yeah.
It was a remake of softball and it 

1084
00:40:49,171 --> 00:40:49,171
caught a faulty off auto Kaunas side and
then they just did.

1085
00:40:49,171 --> 00:40:53,940
Gary joules redid it.
It was like number one in the UK over 

1086
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:56,461
the course of the holidays when it came 
out and then it had another like rebump 

1087
00:40:56,461 --> 00:40:57,190
like that.
Put that commercial,

1088
00:40:57,191 --> 00:40:59,140
put that song back the top of itunes for
like a month.

1089
00:40:59,170 --> 00:41:02,110
What's that game was the last game that 
I played with on a console.

1090
00:41:02,170 --> 00:41:03,970
It's the last day you didn't like your 
student?

1091
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:05,630
No,
I played gears one.

1092
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:08,320
I fucking loved the way it looked.
I loved everything about it,

1093
00:41:08,321 --> 00:41:11,260
but that fucking thing was driving me 
crazy.

1094
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:14,830
Trying to move around and look what this
stupid controller and I'm like,

1095
00:41:14,831 --> 00:41:17,390
why is this have a mouse and keyboard?
It will be so much easier.

1096
00:41:17,391 --> 00:41:22,391
Like if I had a mouse keyboard,
shit touching some fucking ass up in 

1097
00:41:22,391 --> 00:41:22,391
this bitch where it's just.
It's,

1098
00:41:22,610 --> 00:41:23,770
Oh,
is gay already?

1099
00:41:23,771 --> 00:41:26,660
Get this away from me.
This away from me.

1100
00:41:26,661 --> 00:41:27,440
You can't even.
Don't

1101
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,780
be a gaming dinosaur.
I am dude.

1102
00:41:29,830 --> 00:41:34,830
Also,
the second one they did was called the 

1103
00:41:34,830 --> 00:41:34,830
last day.
That was for curious to who?

1104
00:41:34,830 --> 00:41:34,830
I like those features that was

1105
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:35,840
aching.
He Zoom in,

1106
00:41:35,841 --> 00:41:36,680
right.
Left trigger.

1107
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:39,040
Right.
Trigger is so slow.

1108
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:40,780
Can you adjust the sensitivity in the 
mouse?

1109
00:41:41,650 --> 00:41:42,410
Yeah.
Okay.

1110
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:45,610
Well it looks fucking spectacular.
You're missing out.

1111
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,160
I'm missing out on a lot of things,
man.

1112
00:41:48,161 --> 00:41:50,200
I'm not skydiving.
I'm not climbing rocks.

1113
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:55,630
That was all I needed to do.
Brian's got a great story about his dad.

1114
00:41:55,770 --> 00:41:59,080
We tandem set up a couple of times,
but it's an interesting story.

1115
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:02,440
I'll tell it because he's told it twice.
His father,

1116
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:07,480
um,
had a person at work that was always 

1117
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:07,480
saying used to go skydiving with me.
I go skydiving.

1118
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:08,740
I love it.
She used to go all the time.

1119
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:10,600
Well,
she fucking died.

1120
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:15,660
Really?
She fell out of a plane and her shit 

1121
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:15,760
didn't work and their second shit caught
up in her first shit that didn't work.

1122
00:42:15,790 --> 00:42:20,230
Clatsop fucking went screaming to the 
ground from 10,000

1123
00:42:20,231 --> 00:42:23,470
feet in the air and slammed into the 
earth.

1124
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:27,420
Ending her time here.
Fuck that noise about it.

1125
00:42:27,421 --> 00:42:32,421
That afraid of death.
I'm afraid of the screaming before 

1126
00:42:32,421 --> 00:42:34,690
knowing the sense of we're not even four
minutes.

1127
00:42:34,691 --> 00:42:35,550
How much time does it take?

1128
00:42:36,090 --> 00:42:37,440
Terminal Velocity?
Ten thousand feet.

1129
00:42:37,441 --> 00:42:39,660
I'm sure you could just figure it out.
Three hundred 80 miles an hour.

1130
00:42:39,930 --> 00:42:42,030
Three minutes,
three minutes of terror.

1131
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:45,520
It look up a gears of war.
Mad World Zero.

1132
00:42:45,530 --> 00:42:46,500
That's what it was.
Nobody.

1133
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:51,740
It seems like a lot of to have it on 
youtube so you can just assume that if 

1134
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:52,440
something's out there,
it's on youtube now.

1135
00:42:52,950 --> 00:42:57,950
If you ever actually want to find,
try and find somebody official music 

1136
00:42:57,950 --> 00:42:57,950
video.
Good fucking luck.

1137
00:42:58,050 --> 00:43:00,030
Because what they'll do is they upload a
video where it's like,

1138
00:43:00,031 --> 00:43:01,620
hey,
here's what I think of Nicki Minaj,

1139
00:43:01,621 --> 00:43:06,621
this new song,
and it's like Nicki Minaj official 

1140
00:43:06,621 --> 00:43:06,621
video.
You Click on it,

1141
00:43:06,621 --> 00:43:06,630
they use the thumbnail to make it look 
like it's the video.

1142
00:43:06,631 --> 00:43:08,190
And then some guy showing,
talking about.

1143
00:43:08,191 --> 00:43:10,530
You're like,
can I actually find this frigging thing?

1144
00:43:10,531 --> 00:43:14,010
Like usually the one that's actually has
millions of hits is like the last one to

1145
00:43:14,011 --> 00:43:15,180
actually appear.
What's up dog?

1146
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:17,950
This is it right here.
This is the ad.

1147
00:43:24,030 --> 00:43:25,260
Damn.
I want to watch it man.

1148
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,140
Tell these fuckers that.
Go on Youtube.

1149
00:43:30,730 --> 00:43:33,050
It really changed the game for a lot of 
video game advertising.

1150
00:43:33,060 --> 00:43:34,560
Fuck Yeah Dude.
Dude.

1151
00:43:34,860 --> 00:43:35,580
A lot.
Also,

1152
00:43:35,610 --> 00:43:40,610
you guys raised the bar so high as far 
as the graphic appearance of game when 

1153
00:43:40,790 --> 00:43:43,110
we were in your uh,
we came into your office.

1154
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:48,140
It was,
I guess it was like two years before 

1155
00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:48,140
this came out and you guys were deep 
deep in development.

1156
00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:50,700
You had all these crazy models and all 
these,

1157
00:43:50,701 --> 00:43:52,650
you know,
it was mostly just demonstrations of the

1158
00:43:52,651 --> 00:43:54,090
technology,
but you know,

1159
00:43:54,091 --> 00:43:55,920
I remember asking you like,
what are you guys up to?

1160
00:43:55,921 --> 00:43:56,570
Like,
what's going on?

1161
00:43:56,571 --> 00:44:01,571
And you're like,
we're about to take a big fat shit on 

1162
00:44:01,571 --> 00:44:02,550
dual Dr Berman tonight.
And then uh,

1163
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:04,200
then I went,
oh wow.

1164
00:44:04,201 --> 00:44:06,570
And I watched it and like the,
especially the light,

1165
00:44:06,571 --> 00:44:08,710
like a lot of the shit you had was like,
demonstrations.

1166
00:44:09,130 --> 00:44:11,410
How the flash hiders go is that was 
awhile.

1167
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,870
It says 40.
Think about where technology is going to

1168
00:44:13,871 --> 00:44:14,590
be in a few years,
man.

1169
00:44:14,591 --> 00:44:15,700
It's going to be insane.
Like if,

1170
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:20,740
if,
if Sonia Microsoft getting around 

1171
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:20,740
actually making next generation 
consoles,

1172
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:20,740
like imagine what that's going to be 
like,

1173
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,930
what is the bottleneck?
I want it personally.

1174
00:44:22,931 --> 00:44:24,550
I want,
I want some avatar quality stuff,

1175
00:44:24,551 --> 00:44:25,670
real time like that.

1176
00:44:26,070 --> 00:44:27,590
Imax,
imax theaters.

1177
00:44:27,591 --> 00:44:30,990
Imagine that concert where you're all 
together in a

1178
00:44:33,610 --> 00:44:38,610
world of warcraft everyday.
Everyone would just plug into their 

1179
00:44:38,610 --> 00:44:42,160
computer and be some sort of an Elf.
We'd just wandering through the forest 

1180
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:43,590
and we'd all turn into the apartment on 
South Park with a whale episode.

1181
00:44:43,620 --> 00:44:45,870
What's that fucking dangerous thing 
we're doing here?

1182
00:44:45,871 --> 00:44:50,070
Because if we make games more exciting 
and way fucking cooler than real life,

1183
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:55,460
it gets weird.
It's like it's a brain that's getting 

1184
00:44:55,460 --> 00:44:55,460
hooked up,
right?

1185
00:44:55,460 --> 00:44:58,580
Well,
the scary thing is what happens when we 

1186
00:44:58,580 --> 00:44:58,580
can download consciousness into a 
computer singularity.

1187
00:44:58,580 --> 00:45:00,720
She is too.
I want to live in fucking Avatar,

1188
00:45:00,721 --> 00:45:01,190
man.

1189
00:45:01,350 --> 00:45:02,010
You know?
Well,

1190
00:45:02,070 --> 00:45:07,070
you do about the whole thing about the 
singularity where I sure Ray Kurzweil 

1191
00:45:07,070 --> 00:45:07,070
and all that,
right?

1192
00:45:07,070 --> 00:45:07,070
Like it's,
it's,

1193
00:45:07,070 --> 00:45:11,600
I,
I have a feeling that's within our 

1194
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:11,600
lifetime.
For those of you that don't know,

1195
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:13,630
Brian's little butter dog is attacking 
me right now with sweat.

1196
00:45:13,780 --> 00:45:16,720
You know what a butter dog is?
No serious slugs.

1197
00:45:16,721 --> 00:45:17,850
I bet that Joe.
No.

1198
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:19,440
What's a buddy of mine?
He came in,

1199
00:45:19,441 --> 00:45:22,320
he's a photographer from New York.
One time we were doing a photo shoot for

1200
00:45:22,330 --> 00:45:24,960
magazine and he's telling me how much he
hated dating in New York City.

1201
00:45:24,961 --> 00:45:25,350
I'm like,
well,

1202
00:45:25,351 --> 00:45:26,220
why?
He's like,

1203
00:45:26,670 --> 00:45:31,670
well,
there's a certain type of girl in the 

1204
00:45:31,670 --> 00:45:31,670
city who's given up on the dating scene 
and she has what's called a butter dog,

1205
00:45:31,670 --> 00:45:31,860
and I'm like,
what?

1206
00:45:31,861 --> 00:45:33,810
Like she's a good girl,
but her dogs annoying.

1207
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:36,480
No.
It turns out that this type of girl,

1208
00:45:36,481 --> 00:45:38,490
and this might be an urban legend,
he might've been fucking with me,

1209
00:45:38,491 --> 00:45:42,750
but it sounded the way nut butter.
Their boyfriend is their little dog with

1210
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:47,760
a little tongue,
a little peanut butter and then that's 

1211
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:49,920
their boyfriend for an hour now.
So anybody who's from New York and 

1212
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:50,070
confirm or deny this,
if it's an urban legend,

1213
00:45:50,071 --> 00:45:50,880
I would love to know.

1214
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:56,000
It's just a regional thing in Manhattan.
It's your message boards that we can 

1215
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,290
meet and greet other peers of enjoy 
everything,

1216
00:45:58,540 --> 00:46:03,540
but yeah,
I'm sure there's a message board out 

1217
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:03,540
there for girls like to give their pussy
licked my dogs.

1218
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:07,261
Have you guys seen this shit?
That pirate base doing like attacking 

1219
00:46:07,261 --> 00:46:07,930
visa and mastercard because of this Wiki
leaks thing?

1220
00:46:07,931 --> 00:46:08,630
Yeah,
they are.

1221
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:13,400
They are not hosting it and I did all 
the mastercard.

1222
00:46:13,420 --> 00:46:14,980
You can make a donation and Wiki leaks 
right now.

1223
00:46:14,981 --> 00:46:19,981
They're all attacking them and don't.
This wiki leaks thing is fucking 

1224
00:46:19,981 --> 00:46:21,700
fascinating for people who don't know.
And I just found this out today,

1225
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:26,940
already brought it up yesterday or day 
before when we had the podcast and then 

1226
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:26,940
uh,
was it yesterday?

1227
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:27,490
Yesterday,
yesterday.

1228
00:46:27,750 --> 00:46:30,790
I already brought it up yesterday at the
podcast and then today I went online and

1229
00:46:30,791 --> 00:46:31,570
started looking it up.

1230
00:46:31,870 --> 00:46:36,870
The guy was arrested for surprise sex.
Alright buddy.

1231
00:46:37,660 --> 00:46:42,660
The guy was arrested because his condom 
broke and he didn't tell her that's the 

1232
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:44,800
crime and apparently it's only a crime 
in Sweden,

1233
00:46:44,980 --> 00:46:49,980
like this is nuts like that,
an Interpol look to try to get this guy 

1234
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:53,360
and bring them in for questioning.
But this is the charge girls to try to 

1235
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:54,040
get married that way,
to put this woman that he did it with.

1236
00:46:54,070 --> 00:46:59,070
The woman who he had sex with.
This chick has published websites like 

1237
00:46:59,070 --> 00:47:01,570
with a detailed list of how to get 
revenge on men.

1238
00:47:02,590 --> 00:47:07,590
It's this craziness.
I mean the idea that this is enough to 

1239
00:47:07,590 --> 00:47:10,990
bring this guy into justice.
The Internet is going to stop that man.

1240
00:47:11,050 --> 00:47:16,050
There's some,
some shit is going to go down from this 

1241
00:47:16,050 --> 00:47:16,050
and say I'm going to be this easy.
It's really

1242
00:47:16,050 --> 00:47:19,820
hard for any organized system to fight 
because somebody somewhere is going to 

1243
00:47:19,820 --> 00:47:22,380
be willing to host something and how 
many places you're going to break down.

1244
00:47:22,420 --> 00:47:24,390
Shut it down.
It's one head of like,

1245
00:47:24,391 --> 00:47:25,350
wow,
this is fascinating.

1246
00:47:25,351 --> 00:47:26,940
There's information I shouldn't be 
seeing that,

1247
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:28,710
you know,
maybe some of it needs to be exposed and

1248
00:47:28,711 --> 00:47:30,910
on the other hand I'm like,
this is national security man.

1249
00:47:30,911 --> 00:47:35,911
Like we're talking about serious stuff 
that could really put people's lives at 

1250
00:47:35,911 --> 00:47:35,911
risk.
So I,

1251
00:47:35,911 --> 00:47:35,911
I'm on the fence with it,

1252
00:47:35,911 --> 00:47:37,220
both sides of it.
I can see both sides of it too,

1253
00:47:37,221 --> 00:47:39,520
but I can't see defending against it.
You know,

1254
00:47:39,521 --> 00:47:44,521
I,
I don't think it's right or don't think 

1255
00:47:44,521 --> 00:47:46,351
it's wrong,
but I can't see stopping it from 

1256
00:47:46,351 --> 00:47:48,631
happening.
When you fuck with people that are that 

1257
00:47:48,631 --> 00:47:50,491
powerful,
they find some sort of way to get to 

1258
00:47:50,491 --> 00:47:50,491
you.
I know,

1259
00:47:50,491 --> 00:47:51,850
but that's what's fascinating about this
is how transparent it is.

1260
00:47:51,940 --> 00:47:54,730
It's incredibly transparent that all of 
a sudden this woman,

1261
00:47:54,731 --> 00:47:57,280
who by the way has CIA ties follow my 
twitter,

1262
00:47:57,281 --> 00:48:02,281
just go to Joe Rogan.
There's a bunch of things that are 

1263
00:48:02,281 --> 00:48:02,470
tweeted today when I started researching
about it and I'm not talking about.

1264
00:48:02,471 --> 00:48:07,471
I'm talking about like CNN talking about
legit news sources and they're showing 

1265
00:48:07,471 --> 00:48:07,471
all this,
you know,

1266
00:48:07,471 --> 00:48:10,270
how the connections are,
what this guy is actually being arrested

1267
00:48:10,271 --> 00:48:11,620
for.
It's a fascinating thing,

1268
00:48:11,621 --> 00:48:16,621
man.
I'm Sarah resting him for having sex 

1269
00:48:16,621 --> 00:48:18,421
with no condom.
This is consensual sex is not like any 

1270
00:48:18,421 --> 00:48:18,421
main.
It's not rape,

1271
00:48:18,421 --> 00:48:22,861
it's not assault.
It's craziness and this is something 

1272
00:48:22,861 --> 00:48:25,591
that's like Interpol warning for him and
go searching for him all over the place 

1273
00:48:25,591 --> 00:48:28,150
for having sex or you got extra day.
That's insane.

1274
00:48:28,690 --> 00:48:30,490
Did he get extracted from London to 
Sweden?

1275
00:48:30,580 --> 00:48:32,570
Yeah,
it's craziness.

1276
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:33,310
It's really good.
Really

1277
00:48:33,730 --> 00:48:34,690
transparent.
Transparently.

1278
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:37,900
Those things didn't happen sooner.
I remember sitting there and uh,

1279
00:48:37,901 --> 00:48:40,120
I had a friend right about the time we 
were working on real one.

1280
00:48:40,121 --> 00:48:45,121
This is about 97 and I went over to his 
house and he was downloading like full 

1281
00:48:45,121 --> 00:48:48,541
high quality,
like Hollywood movies off of a website 

1282
00:48:48,541 --> 00:48:48,541
and this was [inaudible] 97.
Wow.

1283
00:48:48,541 --> 00:48:50,860
I'm sitting here going and now it's like
bit torrent is everywhere,

1284
00:48:50,861 --> 00:48:51,360
right?
Like,

1285
00:48:51,361 --> 00:48:56,361
it's.
And you have a generation that doesn't 

1286
00:48:56,361 --> 00:48:56,361
want to pay for shit.
Right?

1287
00:48:56,361 --> 00:48:56,361
Right.
Like the Scott pilgrim movies.

1288
00:48:56,361 --> 00:48:56,620
You see that Brian?
Yes.

1289
00:48:56,830 --> 00:48:59,410
One of my favorite movies out of 
nowhere.

1290
00:48:59,411 --> 00:49:03,190
I can't believe they pulled it off.
I thought it was a meet Edgar Wright who

1291
00:49:03,191 --> 00:49:04,240
did Shaun of the dead,
right?

1292
00:49:04,241 --> 00:49:09,241
It was just a great movie.
And what happened was a bond at the box 

1293
00:49:09,241 --> 00:49:12,961
office,
but at the same time it was like a 

1294
00:49:12,961 --> 00:49:12,961
perfect movie for the Gamer.

1295
00:49:12,961 --> 00:49:12,961
Neurogeneration write a hipster 
generation even.

1296
00:49:12,961 --> 00:49:13,690
Right.
And uh,

1297
00:49:13,710 --> 00:49:14,920
I saw somebody tweet about it.
They're like,

1298
00:49:14,921 --> 00:49:16,360
Scott Pilgrim is the movie this 
generation.

1299
00:49:16,361 --> 00:49:18,010
The problem is this generation doesn't 
pay for shit.

1300
00:49:18,550 --> 00:49:20,080
Right.
I had a friend of mine one time,

1301
00:49:20,081 --> 00:49:21,310
she posts on her facebook.
She's like,

1302
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:22,780
oh,
I saw the lovely bones.

1303
00:49:22,781 --> 00:49:27,781
It was amazing.
And it was two weeks before the film 

1304
00:49:27,781 --> 00:49:27,781
came out and like,
you're posting this on your facebook,

1305
00:49:27,781 --> 00:49:28,750
did you get like a screener from 
somebody in la or something?

1306
00:49:28,751 --> 00:49:29,440
She's like,
no,

1307
00:49:29,441 --> 00:49:31,200
I tore into that shit.
Yeah.

1308
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:36,240
People just admit it.
Just talk about it openly on people's 

1309
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:36,550
doors.
Like the music industry,

1310
00:49:36,551 --> 00:49:41,551
right?
Nobody wants to be the fucking music 

1311
00:49:41,551 --> 00:49:41,551
industry right now.
Mark my words,

1312
00:49:41,551 --> 00:49:44,370
we have to get rid of currency and make 
it likes because all those people would 

1313
00:49:44,370 --> 00:49:47,491
have liked it.
And so then you just want to collect 

1314
00:49:47,491 --> 00:49:47,491
likes,
like they're not even money that's going

1315
00:49:47,491 --> 00:49:48,750
to be the currency in the like sixth 
grade.

1316
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:49,870
Do you like,
like me,

1317
00:49:49,871 --> 00:49:50,570
like me?
Yeah.

1318
00:49:50,590 --> 00:49:51,910
But it's kind of point.
I mean,

1319
00:49:51,911 --> 00:49:54,550
you know what I mean?
Because that's all you're going towards.

1320
00:49:54,551 --> 00:49:58,450
And that's like the new currency would 
be a good idea.

1321
00:49:58,750 --> 00:50:01,690
It's actually some sort of a revamped 
idea.

1322
00:50:02,020 --> 00:50:03,910
Have you ever actually tried to,
unlike anything on facebook,

1323
00:50:03,970 --> 00:50:05,140
it's a nightmare.
Yeah.

1324
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:06,430
But that's how it should be.
Yeah.

1325
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:09,730
It's like,
it's easy to get calmed down.

1326
00:50:09,731 --> 00:50:14,731
Drama Queen.
Just to think about this for the crazy 

1327
00:50:14,731 --> 00:50:18,451
bitches.
You're really disliked cupcakes and 

1328
00:50:18,451 --> 00:50:18,880
really you know,
you like what's with the thumbs down?

1329
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:21,760
Why is the 32 thumbs down and 1 million 
thumbs up?

1330
00:50:21,761 --> 00:50:26,761
Who you 32 people I want to know who 
pays for those things like gifts is that

1331
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:32,080
they're calling.
You're paying like $3 for a balloon to 

1332
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:34,751
put on somebody's facebook and that was 
a part of facebook or are you talking 

1333
00:50:34,751 --> 00:50:35,150
about like the lytic?
You've got a button or something.

1334
00:50:35,151 --> 00:50:36,100
Buttons.
That's what it was.

1335
00:50:36,230 --> 00:50:37,410
Virtual goods.
Huge.

1336
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:39,080
Yeah.
I'm not into it.

1337
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:41,360
The whole rage right now in the industry
is they called freemium.

1338
00:50:41,510 --> 00:50:42,890
Really?
It's like the game is free,

1339
00:50:42,891 --> 00:50:45,860
which is a brilliant idea in a bad 
economy and so you start playing it,

1340
00:50:45,861 --> 00:50:47,510
but hey,
you see that guy who is the fancy cowboy

1341
00:50:47,511 --> 00:50:49,190
hat?
You could have that dollar

1342
00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:50,520
me ask you.
What do you think about this?

1343
00:50:50,521 --> 00:50:55,521
What do you think about games where it's
like like everquest and shit where they 

1344
00:50:55,521 --> 00:50:58,790
sell the character that like build up 
some crazy super human character and 

1345
00:50:58,790 --> 00:51:00,240
then they go sell it to digital farming.
Yeah.

1346
00:51:00,241 --> 00:51:02,410
That's great.
Yeah.

1347
00:51:02,670 --> 00:51:02,860
There's

1348
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:08,440
places where they just.
They busted for world of warcraft where 

1349
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:08,440
they'll sit there and they'll just farm.

1350
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:08,440
Yeah,
I watched that on TV,

1351
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:09,090
man.
There was this couple.

1352
00:51:09,091 --> 00:51:12,330
There was all about addiction of gaming.
I don't know what the show was,

1353
00:51:12,510 --> 00:51:17,510
but it was a sad,
sad couple men because they weren't 

1354
00:51:17,510 --> 00:51:17,510
paying attention to their kid.
Their poor kid was like,

1355
00:51:17,510 --> 00:51:17,510
Mommy,
Daddy.

1356
00:51:17,510 --> 00:51:19,020
No,
no.

1357
00:51:19,190 --> 00:51:22,020
It was a real TV show.
It was at and the one of the things that

1358
00:51:22,021 --> 00:51:24,480
they had is a.
all these people that were in,

1359
00:51:24,870 --> 00:51:26,640
I think it was like Russia or somewhere 
like that,

1360
00:51:26,790 --> 00:51:30,930
that were playing games for a Americans.
They build up their account.

1361
00:51:30,931 --> 00:51:32,190
They play all day,
and then they sell it.

1362
00:51:32,330 --> 00:51:37,330
This is the fundamental tradeoff that 
you have right now is you get to the 

1363
00:51:37,330 --> 00:51:37,400
certain point,
we realized there's people often talk in

1364
00:51:37,401 --> 00:51:42,401
the industry about kids versus adults.
Kids have no money and all the time 

1365
00:51:42,401 --> 00:51:43,160
adults have very little time and half 
the money,

1366
00:51:43,430 --> 00:51:44,810
and so which audience are you?
Right?

1367
00:51:44,811 --> 00:51:46,850
If you can have a person who's can get 
paid,

1368
00:51:46,851 --> 00:51:51,851
you know the equivalent to five cents an
hour and every hour you can earn a 

1369
00:51:51,851 --> 00:51:52,550
dollar's worth of gold.
That's a business model for somebody,

1370
00:51:52,551 --> 00:51:54,230
right?
I don't think blizzard is a fan of that.

1371
00:51:54,231 --> 00:51:56,780
Right?
But once you have eyes,

1372
00:51:56,810 --> 00:51:59,240
like I laugh often talk about the seven 
deadly sins is game design,

1373
00:51:59,241 --> 00:52:04,241
right?
Like I walk into this world and I see 

1374
00:52:04,241 --> 00:52:04,241
you with your fancy,
you know,

1375
00:52:04,241 --> 00:52:04,241
two girls went up,
shirt on and I'm like,

1376
00:52:04,241 --> 00:52:04,550
Ooh,
I want one of those.

1377
00:52:04,551 --> 00:52:05,270
How do I get that?

1378
00:52:05,450 --> 00:52:06,620
And then I envy you.
Right?

1379
00:52:06,621 --> 00:52:09,170
And then I wind up getting greed so I 
can collect money and then I want to get

1380
00:52:09,171 --> 00:52:14,171
in too many into wind up with gluttony 
and then it's just all these start 

1381
00:52:14,171 --> 00:52:14,171
factor into each other.
And once you have eyes,

1382
00:52:14,171 --> 00:52:15,770
it's the way the world works.
You see the guy with the nice car.

1383
00:52:15,771 --> 00:52:16,220
It's like,
oh,

1384
00:52:16,221 --> 00:52:17,870
I envy him.
I want that nice car.

1385
00:52:18,050 --> 00:52:23,050
You can apply that to the virtual world.
Exactly as you can apply it to the real 

1386
00:52:23,050 --> 00:52:25,751
world.
You don't blizzard and world of 

1387
00:52:25,751 --> 00:52:25,751
warcraft,
I don't know the exact numbers,

1388
00:52:25,751 --> 00:52:28,541
but they had released a pet whereas it 
was like 25 actual dollars or something 

1389
00:52:28,541 --> 00:52:29,460
like that and their servers wound up 
getting crashed.

1390
00:52:29,510 --> 00:52:32,570
People lining up to buy it just for like
one little pet.

1391
00:52:33,050 --> 00:52:38,050
That's the power of what they've figured
out how to do is make it so that the 

1392
00:52:38,050 --> 00:52:40,280
more you play the game,
the better you get.

1393
00:52:40,610 --> 00:52:42,980
The better your life is.
The more successful you are,

1394
00:52:42,981 --> 00:52:45,380
the more powerful you are,
the better the experience is,

1395
00:52:45,410 --> 00:52:47,540
the more you have control of the people 
in the game.

1396
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:52,800
And that's like the really trippy thing.
It's like it's a time thing they like 

1397
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:53,600
locked you in like it's,
it's a,

1398
00:52:53,660 --> 00:52:58,660
it's a show that you're totally hooked 
on and it never ends and it keeps 

1399
00:52:58,660 --> 00:52:58,990
getting crazier.
New

1400
00:52:59,010 --> 00:53:00,200
People and they,
any,

1401
00:53:00,201 --> 00:53:02,940
any blizzard,
mark my words has created this mold that

1402
00:53:02,941 --> 00:53:04,500
so many other people in the position 
going to follow.

1403
00:53:04,501 --> 00:53:05,190
We get this,
uh,

1404
00:53:05,490 --> 00:53:07,080
this thing in the new gears and we have 
a calendar.

1405
00:53:07,900 --> 00:53:09,420
It's like you play gears and it's like,
Oh hey,

1406
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:14,720
you know,
don't trade in your game because in two 

1407
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:14,720
weeks there's like ticker Tuesday or 
triple sp Thursdays.

1408
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:19,010
Right.
And then your friends are playing on 

1409
00:53:19,010 --> 00:53:19,010
that same day and you want to keep 
going.

1410
00:53:19,010 --> 00:53:22,011
Right.
And maybe there's like a psychologist 

1411
00:53:22,011 --> 00:53:22,011
trick.
There were like,

1412
00:53:22,011 --> 00:53:24,321
you know,
you don't sell the game because you're 

1413
00:53:24,321 --> 00:53:24,321
thinking there might be something coming
up.

1414
00:53:24,321 --> 00:53:27,681
Right?
We're dungeon masters and we're always 

1415
00:53:27,681 --> 00:53:27,681
like manipulating experience online to 
have

1416
00:53:27,681 --> 00:53:28,050
new shit happen.
Yeah.

1417
00:53:28,051 --> 00:53:30,300
It's kind of crazy that it just keeps 
going though.

1418
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:33,390
But I mean your average person have over
their life.

1419
00:53:33,391 --> 00:53:38,391
Right?
So in a world where you start gaining 

1420
00:53:38,391 --> 00:53:40,791
that control as like the biggest problem
is like when you're young is figuring 

1421
00:53:40,791 --> 00:53:40,791
out what you want to do when you grow 
up.

1422
00:53:41,130 --> 00:53:41,980
Right.
Like that.

1423
00:53:42,020 --> 00:53:44,190
Thankfully I was lucky and I saw games.
I was like boom.

1424
00:53:44,191 --> 00:53:49,191
That I've talked to kids are like,
I'm going to school and I don't know 

1425
00:53:49,191 --> 00:53:49,191
what I want to do.
It's like,

1426
00:53:49,191 --> 00:53:53,511
dude,
pick something and be surgical about it 

1427
00:53:53,511 --> 00:53:53,511
and decide that you're gonna be the best
at that.

1428
00:53:53,511 --> 00:53:55,680
But the problem is finding something for
a lot of kids,

1429
00:53:55,681 --> 00:53:58,020
the real issue is finding something.
Then you got lucky.

1430
00:53:58,021 --> 00:54:03,021
I got lucky a lot of people did,
but it's like it's very difficult to 

1431
00:54:03,021 --> 00:54:03,570
find the thing that you're into know you
don't want to like say,

1432
00:54:03,571 --> 00:54:04,560
oh,
it's going to be this,

1433
00:54:04,561 --> 00:54:09,561
and then you're doing it and then 
halfway into you're like this fucking 

1434
00:54:09,561 --> 00:54:09,561
belonging.

1435
00:54:09,561 --> 00:54:09,570
So it's difficult to find what that 
thing is.

1436
00:54:09,571 --> 00:54:11,050
It's like asking,
asking it a young,

1437
00:54:11,100 --> 00:54:12,450
especially at a young age when you don't
know,

1438
00:54:12,750 --> 00:54:14,730
you hardly know a lot about what's going
on in the world around you.

1439
00:54:14,910 --> 00:54:19,910
But at the same time,
that opportunity now with the internet 

1440
00:54:19,910 --> 00:54:19,910
is greater than ever.
Right?

1441
00:54:19,910 --> 00:54:22,200
Like you could shoot a viral video,
you could start a podcast,

1442
00:54:22,201 --> 00:54:27,201
you can do anything.
And if you start getting better and 

1443
00:54:27,201 --> 00:54:27,201
better at it,
you can build community,

1444
00:54:27,201 --> 00:54:27,201
right?
If that's what you want to do.

1445
00:54:27,201 --> 00:54:28,880
But what if you want to be a carpenter 
or what if you want to be a painter?

1446
00:54:28,890 --> 00:54:30,000
You know,
there's so many.

1447
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:32,790
For kids,
the hardest thing is finding the thing,

1448
00:54:33,180 --> 00:54:34,890
finding whatever the fuck it is like you
know,

1449
00:54:34,891 --> 00:54:39,891
most kids don't get enough exposure to 
interesting ideas between the 

1450
00:54:39,891 --> 00:54:39,891
schoolwork.
When you,

1451
00:54:39,891 --> 00:54:41,610
when you go to school,
when you think about what you gotta do,

1452
00:54:41,611 --> 00:54:43,800
you gotta get up at fucking 7:00
in the morning.

1453
00:54:43,950 --> 00:54:46,010
You've got to leave,
catch a bus with a bunch of other Douche

1454
00:54:46,011 --> 00:54:48,360
bags,
do a bunch of shit that sucks all day.

1455
00:54:48,540 --> 00:54:50,760
Listen to a bunch of people tell you 
never going to make anything out of your

1456
00:54:50,761 --> 00:54:52,710
life unless you pay attention to them 
and they're like,

1457
00:54:52,711 --> 00:54:54,150
listen bitch,
you're teaching school.

1458
00:54:54,151 --> 00:54:55,740
I know you don't make any money.
Shut the fuck up.

1459
00:54:55,741 --> 00:55:00,420
Don't you love how life is so great when
you're a kid like no the other moments,

1460
00:55:00,421 --> 00:55:02,970
but it sucked.
So to find something that you truly love

1461
00:55:02,971 --> 00:55:07,971
in the midst of all this,
like programming is what school is no 

1462
00:55:07,971 --> 00:55:08,790
more than programming.
It is education.

1463
00:55:08,791 --> 00:55:10,800
There is information that you're going 
to download,

1464
00:55:10,801 --> 00:55:13,770
you're going to remember it,
but the reality of what it is is getting

1465
00:55:13,771 --> 00:55:16,590
you program to get used to doing things 
you don't want to do.

1466
00:55:16,770 --> 00:55:18,710
Listening to people that you don't want 
to hear,

1467
00:55:18,750 --> 00:55:19,260
you're around people.

1468
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:21,300
You don't want to be around.
There's a Buzzer,

1469
00:55:21,330 --> 00:55:23,460
but wide.
Why does there have to be a buzzer?

1470
00:55:23,461 --> 00:55:28,461
Stupid?
What is it so important that we fucking 

1471
00:55:28,461 --> 00:55:28,461
leave at a certain time and get there at
a certain time?

1472
00:55:28,461 --> 00:55:32,780
You're turning me into a robot.
You know you're turning me into some 

1473
00:55:32,780 --> 00:55:33,810
worker asshole that just goes and does 
the same goddamn thing everyday.

1474
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:37,910
Providing order for a certain mind that 
might otherwise to just the devolvement.

1475
00:55:37,911 --> 00:55:39,480
Again,
there's ways to educate people.

1476
00:55:39,570 --> 00:55:44,570
A little teasers.
My favorite hobby is if I'm out with 

1477
00:55:44,570 --> 00:55:45,840
friends and I was out in San Francisco 
with a buddy and he had a date.

1478
00:55:46,140 --> 00:55:51,140
Who is this?
A public school teacher at any time I 

1479
00:55:51,140 --> 00:55:51,140
find one of my polaroid,
I'm like,

1480
00:55:51,140 --> 00:55:54,340
America,
me buy your drink and it will just sit 

1481
00:55:54,340 --> 00:55:54,340
there and pick their brain for like an 
hour about.

1482
00:55:54,340 --> 00:55:54,340
My uncles were public school teachers.

1483
00:55:54,340 --> 00:55:55,260
They have horror stories.
Oh of course.

1484
00:55:55,770 --> 00:55:56,960
Teaches in New Jersey.
Yeah.

1485
00:55:57,510 --> 00:56:00,240
Like so you know the classes that are 
huge,

1486
00:56:00,241 --> 00:56:05,241
like kids who are young,
like super young hooking up and 

1487
00:56:05,241 --> 00:56:07,611
bathrooms.
They have to call child protective 

1488
00:56:07,611 --> 00:56:07,611
services.
It's a horror story of well you know,

1489
00:56:07,611 --> 00:56:09,060
they're all doing crazy shit now too 
because of the Internet.

1490
00:56:09,390 --> 00:56:14,390
You know,
you hear like 13 year olds are talking 

1491
00:56:14,390 --> 00:56:14,390
about,
you know,

1492
00:56:14,390 --> 00:56:15,150
making out with other girls.
There was no girls making out with girls

1493
00:56:15,151 --> 00:56:17,310
when I was 13.
That shit never took place.

1494
00:56:18,060 --> 00:56:19,210
They're all doing it,
you know,

1495
00:56:20,670 --> 00:56:21,870
13 year old girls.
Yeah.

1496
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:23,980
That was the,
I knew a lot of 13

1497
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:24,470
year olds,
dude.

1498
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:29,520
None of them were making out with each 
other and everybody would say they were 

1499
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:29,520
going to do something and you never knew
quite what it was.

1500
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:33,871
Right.
And there was this kind of like adult 

1501
00:56:33,871 --> 00:56:33,871
conspiracy to keep like pornography or 
away from you and things like that.

1502
00:56:33,871 --> 00:56:34,360
You had to go to the woods and find 
porn.

1503
00:56:34,361 --> 00:56:36,610
We've talked about this 100 times on the
poc finding,

1504
00:56:37,210 --> 00:56:39,400
finding the woods.
So funny.

1505
00:56:39,401 --> 00:56:44,050
Everyone's got the same story.
Everybody dirty stuff.

1506
00:56:44,140 --> 00:56:49,140
We didn't bring this up to you and 
everyone has the same goddamn story in 

1507
00:56:49,140 --> 00:56:50,410
the magazine.
You shouldn't make an adult bookstore in

1508
00:56:50,411 --> 00:56:52,020
the woods.
It'd probably be the most successful.

1509
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:56,370
I just don't even have any signs.
Here's like a Johnny Porto Ct.

1510
00:56:56,371 --> 00:57:01,371
It looks like ron jeremy and going 
through with a giant sack of porn and 

1511
00:57:01,371 --> 00:57:02,040
it's like,
yeah,

1512
00:57:02,180 --> 00:57:07,040
cherry a playboy.
It's the dirtiest shit you could find.

1513
00:57:07,041 --> 00:57:08,620
It was the bad stuff we grew up with.
oh,

1514
00:57:08,621 --> 00:57:09,550
your dog.
There we go.

1515
00:57:09,580 --> 00:57:11,890
It was always penthouse with a lot of 
water damage.

1516
00:57:11,891 --> 00:57:13,000
It was always the girls.
I like that.

1517
00:57:13,010 --> 00:57:15,220
The sarlacc pit down there.
It was horrible,

1518
00:57:15,221 --> 00:57:20,221
right?
Getting your young impressionable mind 

1519
00:57:20,221 --> 00:57:20,221
is like,
oh my god,

1520
00:57:20,221 --> 00:57:20,221
I was supposed to think this is hot.
What is going on heRe?

1521
00:57:20,221 --> 00:57:22,420
And it was terrifying.
When you click of a button,

1522
00:57:22,421 --> 00:57:23,590
you can see two girls.
One cup.

1523
00:57:24,510 --> 00:57:25,260
Yeah,
we,

1524
00:57:25,261 --> 00:57:27,690
we've talked about this before about how
crazy it is,

1525
00:57:27,970 --> 00:57:31,590
how close all this stuff is.
Like someone can send you a twitter link

1526
00:57:31,591 --> 00:57:34,050
and you click on it and Just give me the
most horrible

1527
00:57:34,330 --> 00:57:39,330
mark my words if I ever have children 
and they were not going to get a 

1528
00:57:39,330 --> 00:57:39,800
cellphone until they're maybe 13.

1529
00:57:40,230 --> 00:57:45,230
Yeah.
But you know what the worst thing you 

1530
00:57:45,230 --> 00:57:45,230
want to have is an uninformed kid.
True.

1531
00:57:45,230 --> 00:57:50,080
when all the other kids talk to them and
just let them be in the same flow as 

1532
00:57:51,661 --> 00:57:56,661
everybody else,
just to let them know what the fuck is 

1533
00:57:56,661 --> 00:57:56,661
going on while,
as long as that basis there.

1534
00:57:56,661 --> 00:57:56,661
Right?
Yeah.

1535
00:57:56,661 --> 00:57:59,160
Yeah.
It's the old expression,

1536
00:57:59,161 --> 00:58:00,990
the kids are going to be all right.
You know,

1537
00:58:00,991 --> 00:58:02,820
and there they are.
They're going to be all right.

1538
00:58:02,850 --> 00:58:03,810
They're going to be fine.
She's like,

1539
00:58:03,811 --> 00:58:05,190
we're fine.
We're worried about them,

1540
00:58:05,191 --> 00:58:10,191
you know,
and I have little daughters and 

1541
00:58:10,191 --> 00:58:10,191
logically,
you know,

1542
00:58:10,191 --> 00:58:11,310
I can say this and of course,
you know paternally,

1543
00:58:11,311 --> 00:58:13,380
I just want to protect them in the 
fucking world.

1544
00:58:13,381 --> 00:58:18,381
and all that,
but I understand where that's coming 

1545
00:58:18,381 --> 00:58:18,381
from.
These kids are going to be fine.

1546
00:58:18,381 --> 00:58:18,381
They're growing up with other humans

1547
00:58:18,381 --> 00:58:23,050
to some extent.
You want them to make their own 

1548
00:58:23,050 --> 00:58:23,050
mistakes.
Right?

1549
00:58:23,050 --> 00:58:23,050
I've known parents,
yes,

1550
00:58:23,050 --> 00:58:23,740
pad the house of too much and it's like 
let them

1551
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:26,010
fall over once in a while.
Let them learn how to balance,

1552
00:58:26,011 --> 00:58:26,460
right?
Like,

1553
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:27,210
well,
yeah,

1554
00:58:27,211 --> 00:58:28,830
but you know,
you gotta be Careful.

1555
00:58:28,860 --> 00:58:30,780
You don't want them to be kids die,
you know,

1556
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:33,820
they don't have a stove in the middle of
the living room right now.

1557
00:58:33,860 --> 00:58:35,730
But I mean if you have hard floors,
you know,

1558
00:58:35,731 --> 00:58:37,620
like I have marble floors.
It's kinda tricky.

1559
00:58:38,010 --> 00:58:39,810
You know,
you gotta you gotta watch them.

1560
00:58:39,990 --> 00:58:41,100
But,
but that's not the point.

1561
00:58:41,130 --> 00:58:42,650
The point is,
you know,

1562
00:58:42,690 --> 00:58:45,840
what these,
they're growing up with other people and

1563
00:58:45,841 --> 00:58:49,380
I think things always get better and 
even though it seems like shit's worse,

1564
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:54,680
even though it seems like shit's worse 
as far as like the economy and all this 

1565
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:55,740
craziness as far as invasion of privacy 
and you know,

1566
00:58:55,741 --> 00:58:56,450
and uh,
the,

1567
00:58:56,451 --> 00:59:01,451
the,
the access to information that we have 

1568
00:59:01,451 --> 00:59:01,500
and they're getting inundated with 
images and videos and all this shit that

1569
00:59:01,501 --> 00:59:03,150
we didn't see it until we were well 
mature.

1570
00:59:03,690 --> 00:59:05,100
They're goIng to be fine.
They're just,

1571
00:59:05,101 --> 00:59:06,990
this is how they're grown up now.
This is just how it is.

1572
00:59:06,991 --> 00:59:10,020
And we're just the old people that are 
just like our parents,

1573
00:59:10,021 --> 00:59:10,480
like,
oh,

1574
00:59:10,481 --> 00:59:11,760
kids these days don't get on.
Okay.

1575
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:13,350
Same video games.

1576
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,550
It's just weird.
Like we're like kids these days with her

1577
00:59:16,551 --> 00:59:18,770
fucking ass to mouth porn.
you know,

1578
00:59:18,771 --> 00:59:20,900
they've got asked her mouth porn on 
their fucking iphone.

1579
00:59:20,901 --> 00:59:21,740
Well,
just what it is.

1580
00:59:21,741 --> 00:59:22,040
It's just

1581
00:59:22,220 --> 00:59:27,220
this is the new world and the world 
constantly keeps getting more and more 

1582
00:59:27,220 --> 00:59:27,330
complex world of estimates.
It's,

1583
00:59:27,650 --> 00:59:30,020
the world is always getting more and 
more fucked up.

1584
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:33,100
It's always getting more complicated,
more so bizarre.

1585
00:59:33,110 --> 00:59:36,270
Is it going to the zombie apocalypse is 
the look.

1586
00:59:36,290 --> 00:59:38,240
I think as long as there's freedom of 
information,

1587
00:59:38,241 --> 00:59:43,241
the way we were expressing each other 
right now and communicating with each 

1588
00:59:43,241 --> 00:59:45,941
other,
people are gonna be able to figure out 

1589
00:59:45,941 --> 00:59:45,941
things quicker,
you know,

1590
00:59:45,941 --> 00:59:47,240
and I think kids are going to be able to
figure out this multifaceted,

1591
00:59:47,241 --> 00:59:52,241
fucked up chaotic world far quicker than
some fucking doofus from 1963 now he 

1592
00:59:52,370 --> 00:59:57,370
takes some kid from 1963.
You can talk them into anything they 

1593
00:59:57,370 --> 00:59:59,891
didn't know shit.
Now today kids are going to be more 

1594
00:59:59,891 --> 01:00:02,201
savvy,
more aware and more innovation to ask 

1595
01:00:02,201 --> 01:00:02,201
anybody anything anymore who will fuck 
it up?

1596
01:00:02,270 --> 01:00:02,720
You can find it.

1597
01:00:02,730 --> 01:00:03,210
Right?
It was.

1598
01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:05,990
Wasn't was complaining about this 
actually he was a.

1599
01:00:05,991 --> 01:00:10,991
There was steve wasniak when the 
creatOrs of apple's doing an interview 

1600
01:00:10,991 --> 01:00:10,991
where he's saying back in my day,
you know,

1601
01:00:10,991 --> 01:00:12,350
you had a.
If you had a question,

1602
01:00:12,351 --> 01:00:13,970
you had to find a smart person and ask 
them,

1603
01:00:14,090 --> 01:00:16,100
well that's dumb.
Why would I?

1604
01:00:16,310 --> 01:00:21,310
Why are you complaining about that?
There's not that many fucking smart 

1605
01:00:21,310 --> 01:00:21,350
people,
but I've got to seek out one dude that's

1606
01:00:21,380 --> 01:00:23,450
retarded.
I have To go and talk to the professor.

1607
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:28,480
That's why they're so god damn arrogant 
about their estimation thing about the 

1608
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:28,480
mayans.
RIght.

1609
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:28,480
If they used to control them by the,
you know,

1610
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:29,300
all the quote priests,
you know,

1611
01:00:29,330 --> 01:00:30,600
figured out science and figure it out,
you know,

1612
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:31,190
how the,
uh,

1613
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:36,200
you know,
the lunar cycles and how everything 

1614
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:36,200
would turn out.
and then like,

1615
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:36,200
everyone's like,
wow,

1616
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:36,200
how did they know this?

1617
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:39,700
It must be magic.
Or like we're controlling this through 

1618
01:00:39,700 --> 01:00:39,700
knowledge,
right?

1619
01:00:39,700 --> 01:00:39,700
Yeah.
Well,

1620
01:00:39,700 --> 01:00:42,440
there's now before the library of 
alexandria burned down,

1621
01:00:42,470 --> 01:00:43,320
they had.
I mean,

1622
01:00:43,330 --> 01:00:44,340
that was the idea as well.
They,

1623
01:00:44,380 --> 01:00:49,380
they kept all the knowledge.
they had all this information about all 

1624
01:00:49,380 --> 01:00:49,940
sorts of different things that the lay 
person was unaware of.

1625
01:00:50,070 --> 01:00:51,950
So everybody can get it.
Google bitch.

1626
01:00:52,040 --> 01:00:57,040
Damn you.
We used to have to seek out a tim 

1627
01:00:57,040 --> 01:00:58,961
sweeney,
eric john carmack and hang onto the and 

1628
01:00:58,961 --> 01:00:58,961
right up to the top.
That's true.

1629
01:00:58,961 --> 01:01:03,341
Now there's just fucking computer 
connection to the internet and all your 

1630
01:01:03,341 --> 01:01:04,280
questions answered,
but it's not always true to not.

1631
01:01:04,290 --> 01:01:05,020
Oh,
that's the thing is,

1632
01:01:05,180 --> 01:01:07,760
but it's getting there.
It really is getting closer and closer.

1633
01:01:07,761 --> 01:01:10,250
It's getting to the point.
There's a lot of misinformation,

1634
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:15,280
but there's also a lot of information.
There's a lot of good information and I 

1635
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:18,581
think that's good because I think it 
developed just like we need to be able 

1636
01:01:18,581 --> 01:01:22,181
to discern between bullshit and reality 
and the real world need to be able to 

1637
01:01:22,181 --> 01:01:25,151
discern between bullshit and reality 
online and people will sort it all out 

1638
01:01:25,151 --> 01:01:25,151
and figure it out.

1639
01:01:25,151 --> 01:01:25,310
You know,
if you know,

1640
01:01:25,340 --> 01:01:30,340
there's a lot of people that have it.
There's a lot of urban myths about all 

1641
01:01:30,340 --> 01:01:30,340
sorts of different things.
You know,

1642
01:01:30,340 --> 01:01:30,940
if you drink a coke and take the,
you know,

1643
01:01:30,980 --> 01:01:33,070
fucking this with it,
you'll die.

1644
01:01:33,071 --> 01:01:33,680
You know?
I mean,

1645
01:01:33,681 --> 01:01:38,681
how many different stories,
if we ever heard when they just go pop 

1646
01:01:38,681 --> 01:01:38,681
rocks growing up.
Yes,

1647
01:01:38,681 --> 01:01:39,440
that's right.
That's what it was.

1648
01:01:39,550 --> 01:01:41,830
It was mikey from the life cereal 
commercial died.

1649
01:01:41,831 --> 01:01:45,120
His stomach explodes right when there 
was the urban legend about the girl that

1650
01:01:45,121 --> 01:01:47,570
stuck the hotdog in her pussy and then 
had to go to the hospital.

1651
01:01:47,571 --> 01:01:48,740
You never heard that one?
Didn't hear that one.

1652
01:01:48,770 --> 01:01:51,320
That was the other one there.
All the maggots were starting coming out

1653
01:01:51,321 --> 01:01:56,321
of her ass.
And then there's the one about the 

1654
01:01:56,321 --> 01:01:56,321
lobster that right.
You heard that one rIght?

1655
01:01:56,321 --> 01:01:56,321
What was that one?

1656
01:01:56,321 --> 01:02:01,260
That girl apparently took less than one 
lobster.

1657
01:02:01,340 --> 01:02:06,340
Put it in here.
Then like lit a match to it to make its 

1658
01:02:06,340 --> 01:02:06,340
tail flip around and turns out the 
lobster head,

1659
01:02:06,340 --> 01:02:08,440
like planted a bunch of eggs in her and 
then three weeks later she died the tub.

1660
01:02:08,490 --> 01:02:09,340
IT's like,
yeah,

1661
01:02:09,510 --> 01:02:11,830
yeah,
I can certainly See thAt some disgusting

1662
01:02:11,840 --> 01:02:13,490
giRL wAs shit breath telling me that 
story.

1663
01:02:13,610 --> 01:02:18,610
It really seems like life is going 
towards like the having a matrix where 

1664
01:02:18,610 --> 01:02:23,080
you live a bubble and your whole life is
like you're in suCh a harsh.

1665
01:02:23,150 --> 01:02:25,590
She took this lab staff.
She's stalking and helpless here.

1666
01:02:25,670 --> 01:02:27,000
Right?
Right.

1667
01:02:29,210 --> 01:02:33,270
And it was fuCking lobster traps all his
eggs in a snatch.

1668
01:02:33,271 --> 01:02:36,600
It was a lobster fest until fucking labs
is a crime and I have a pussy.

1669
01:02:36,610 --> 01:02:41,610
What a whore.
Think that's the case that that life is 

1670
01:02:41,610 --> 01:02:45,081
going towards where we're going to be in
a bubble in our whole life is going to 

1671
01:02:45,081 --> 01:02:48,351
be some kind of like matrix style cocoon
where we're all working for the people 

1672
01:02:48,351 --> 01:02:50,790
who actually have people skills will 
suddenly,

1673
01:02:50,791 --> 01:02:52,710
everybody's to know how to be connected 
and how to get all this data.

1674
01:02:52,711 --> 01:02:53,370
RIght.
But those,

1675
01:02:53,371 --> 01:02:58,371
you actually can interact in real life 
will actually do pretty well if you've 

1676
01:02:58,371 --> 01:03:01,151
got a combination of that.
It's interesting to try to speculate as 

1677
01:03:01,151 --> 01:03:05,991
to what exactly was going to happen,
but we all know that something's 

1678
01:03:05,991 --> 01:03:08,391
happening and that's the most 
interesting thing about this 

1679
01:03:08,391 --> 01:03:10,221
conversation is that we all are just 
admitting like everyone's saying is no 

1680
01:03:10,221 --> 01:03:10,230
one saying,
well,

1681
01:03:10,231 --> 01:03:12,810
this is going to stop and everything 
will level off and then we'll just,

1682
01:03:12,811 --> 01:03:13,680
you know,
go fishing,

1683
01:03:14,170 --> 01:03:16,440
go faster than ever though 
exponentially.

1684
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:16,800
Right?
Yeah.

1685
01:03:16,801 --> 01:03:20,460
It's moving in a weird direction when 
you were talking about that smart dust,

1686
01:03:20,700 --> 01:03:21,450
you know,
and uh,

1687
01:03:21,470 --> 01:03:26,470
you know,
the ability to track you and little 

1688
01:03:26,470 --> 01:03:28,581
particles that can hang on to you and 
three d computers and this whole wiki 

1689
01:03:28,581 --> 01:03:28,581
leaks thing.
I mean,

1690
01:03:28,581 --> 01:03:32,550
what would the transparency of the whole
process now seeing this guy get arrested

1691
01:03:32,551 --> 01:03:36,270
for not wearing a condom and there's 
tracking him down like he's a killer and

1692
01:03:36,271 --> 01:03:38,790
that is the main thing.
He's done wrong.

1693
01:03:38,820 --> 01:03:40,470
He didn't wear a condom.
Nobody knows.

1694
01:03:40,860 --> 01:03:42,390
Nobody knows anybody else involved that 
though,

1695
01:03:42,391 --> 01:03:44,280
right?
He's the one who's like willinG to stand

1696
01:03:44,281 --> 01:03:46,470
up there and take it on the chin as the 
face of this whole operation.

1697
01:03:46,471 --> 01:03:51,471
I don't understand the whole story.
I need to look into it more and I 

1698
01:03:51,471 --> 01:03:53,070
hesitate to say anytime anything 
involves anything political,

1699
01:03:53,071 --> 01:03:58,071
I always just,
you know what it's like watching a tv 

1700
01:03:58,071 --> 01:03:58,071
show that's fucked me over.

1701
01:03:58,071 --> 01:03:58,950
you know,
this show sucks.

1702
01:03:59,220 --> 01:04:01,770
You're not getting me again.
I'm not going to watch your stupid show.

1703
01:04:02,100 --> 01:04:07,100
And that's how I feel about politics.
So I wouldn't anything like this is in 

1704
01:04:07,100 --> 01:04:07,100
the news.
I'm like,

1705
01:04:07,100 --> 01:04:07,170
fuck you.
My time is valuable.

1706
01:04:07,290 --> 01:04:09,270
You guys are all crazy.
You're all full of shit.

1707
01:04:09,300 --> 01:04:10,680
Kiss my ass.
I'm not paying attention,

1708
01:04:11,010 --> 01:04:13,080
but as this is getting further and 
further along,

1709
01:04:13,081 --> 01:04:16,110
I'm getting sucked in because it's so 
surreal.

1710
01:04:16,170 --> 01:04:17,340
Yeah.
It's so strange.

1711
01:04:17,370 --> 01:04:22,370
You don't really.
Only a certain percentage of the cables 

1712
01:04:22,370 --> 01:04:22,370
were actually released.
It was something like $20,000

1713
01:04:22,370 --> 01:04:22,980
out of like three or 300,000
or something.

1714
01:04:22,990 --> 01:04:24,420
Fucking panicking,
man.

1715
01:04:24,500 --> 01:04:29,500
These politicians are panicking.
They're going to know all these other 

1716
01:04:29,500 --> 01:04:30,620
nations are going to know what kind of 
shit we talked about them.

1717
01:04:30,750 --> 01:04:32,340
You have a hard time containing data 
though.

1718
01:04:32,341 --> 01:04:33,720
Even in my business,
it's just like,

1719
01:04:33,721 --> 01:04:38,721
oh,
suddenly something just appears as a 

1720
01:04:38,721 --> 01:04:38,721
rumor on a website.

1721
01:04:38,721 --> 01:04:38,721
It's like,
how the fuck it is amazing.

1722
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:43,760
It's interesting.
It's somebody's profitinG by this 

1723
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:43,760
because I know in the gaming industry,
If you're going to leak something too,

1724
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:48,201
like you know a video game website,
you're not going to make money and hope 

1725
01:04:48,201 --> 01:04:50,560
somebody wouldn't have two beers at a 
pub and tell him something like that.

1726
01:04:50,570 --> 01:04:52,160
It's people run with it.
Right?

1727
01:04:52,170 --> 01:04:57,170
That's one of the most fascinating 
things about bit torrents and all this 

1728
01:04:57,170 --> 01:04:59,691
stuff.
It's almost like people feel compelled 

1729
01:04:59,691 --> 01:04:59,691
to contribute.
It's like there's a,

1730
01:04:59,691 --> 01:05:04,300
there's a like a human urge to put 
information and stuff available online.

1731
01:05:04,590 --> 01:05:06,360
Like before people were getting chased 
down.

1732
01:05:06,510 --> 01:05:10,200
People love the idea that you could go 
to their site and get a bunch of shit.

1733
01:05:10,260 --> 01:05:15,260
Yeah.
You can get a bunch of shit from them 

1734
01:05:15,260 --> 01:05:15,260
and they,
they,

1735
01:05:15,260 --> 01:05:15,260
they love to be.
Yeah.

1736
01:05:15,260 --> 01:05:16,530
They love to be distributors of it,
you knoW,

1737
01:05:16,531 --> 01:05:18,010
it was so common.
There were so many

1738
01:05:18,010 --> 01:05:23,010
different sites that had illegal shit 
and there's got to be like a human 

1739
01:05:23,010 --> 01:05:26,161
nature thing where you just want to like
share and host and have community and 

1740
01:05:26,161 --> 01:05:26,161
remember where's,
where's sites?

1741
01:05:26,410 --> 01:05:28,620
YeAh.
I mean that's different than bit torn p,

1742
01:05:28,621 --> 01:05:31,930
don't people don't know that there was 
these weird fucking hidden sites.

1743
01:05:31,931 --> 01:05:34,300
We can go and download yours with z.
Yeah.

1744
01:05:34,320 --> 01:05:37,990
W a r you go and Mexico suarez and they 
got all shut down.

1745
01:05:38,020 --> 01:05:39,640
They've and figured out how to stop 
them,

1746
01:05:39,790 --> 01:05:44,790
but then this whole peer to peer thing 
came up and the peer to peer thing is 

1747
01:05:44,790 --> 01:05:45,910
too confusing for people don't know.
It's like when you were downloading,

1748
01:05:45,911 --> 01:05:48,400
so if you're getting a movie,
you're not getting it from one person.

1749
01:05:48,580 --> 01:05:51,520
You're getting it from like 100 people 
or more even.

1750
01:05:51,730 --> 01:05:56,730
You're getting all these files and 
somehoW or another they're compiling 

1751
01:05:56,730 --> 01:05:56,730
your computer.

1752
01:05:56,730 --> 01:05:58,600
Yeah,
but it's craziness because you're taking

1753
01:05:58,601 --> 01:06:03,601
all these ones and zeros from like 30 
different places and then the final 

1754
01:06:03,601 --> 01:06:03,840
product is illegal.
Yeah.

1755
01:06:03,940 --> 01:06:04,510
Like,
whoa,

1756
01:06:04,511 --> 01:06:05,680
what are you saying that.
How do you,

1757
01:06:05,681 --> 01:06:06,410
how do you track?
Right.

1758
01:06:06,460 --> 01:06:08,200
Where did it come from?
Somebody had it.

1759
01:06:08,410 --> 01:06:11,450
If the one person that had it,
there's one illegal copy,

1760
01:06:11,451 --> 01:06:12,700
right?
And then they're all illegal.

1761
01:06:12,701 --> 01:06:17,701
but what if there's one legal?
So here's the key is to provide a 

1762
01:06:17,701 --> 01:06:17,701
service that people are willing to pay 
for.

1763
01:06:17,701 --> 01:06:19,330
Why do you think hollywood's betting on 
three d so much right now?

1764
01:06:19,510 --> 01:06:20,020
Right?
It's like,

1765
01:06:20,021 --> 01:06:20,930
okay,
what are we going?

1766
01:06:21,150 --> 01:06:26,150
What are you gonna actually do think 
that's adding a third dimension and the 

1767
01:06:26,150 --> 01:06:26,780
key to that as nfl,
I don't think it's porn and I fell.

1768
01:06:26,820 --> 01:06:31,820
It would be dope too.
There were filming all ufc isn't 

1769
01:06:31,820 --> 01:06:31,820
thredup,
ufc in three d that that'd be genius.

1770
01:06:31,820 --> 01:06:32,230
Right.
Then it's an event,

1771
01:06:32,231 --> 01:06:33,910
right?
like filmed a bunch of them already.

1772
01:06:34,060 --> 01:06:35,470
I want,
I want my three d to be an event.

1773
01:06:35,471 --> 01:06:37,920
I want to go see avatar,
toronto and three d.

1774
01:06:38,020 --> 01:06:40,660
I dOn't want to go see like meet the 
foCkers six and three d.

1775
01:06:40,661 --> 01:06:41,530
I don't really care.
Right?

1776
01:06:41,570 --> 01:06:42,820
Yeah.
In my house,

1777
01:06:42,821 --> 01:06:44,500
like you know,
I don't really need to see like,

1778
01:06:44,501 --> 01:06:45,610
you know,
your average rental in three d,

1779
01:06:45,611 --> 01:06:47,230
but when there's an event,
there's a fight,

1780
01:06:47,231 --> 01:06:49,090
there's a superbowl.
I will,

1781
01:06:49,091 --> 01:06:51,430
I'll put mY glasses on to watch that 
movie.

1782
01:06:51,490 --> 01:06:55,550
Something fucking super like the more I 
watched you.

1783
01:06:55,980 --> 01:06:58,150
I'm sorry.
The more watch tv in three d though.

1784
01:06:58,151 --> 01:07:03,151
It's not really about that.
I think why they're trying to make all 

1785
01:07:03,151 --> 01:07:03,190
the movies,
three ds and all the games.

1786
01:07:03,191 --> 01:07:08,191
Three d is to make it to the point that 
what we're going towards is like walls 

1787
01:07:08,191 --> 01:07:12,361
of tvs or like I was saying,
the imax movie theater where it's going 

1788
01:07:12,361 --> 01:07:12,361
to be the bubble,
aren't you?

1789
01:07:12,361 --> 01:07:13,470
Well,
the three 60,

1790
01:07:13,471 --> 01:07:16,450
like I think they're really trying to 
push that,

1791
01:07:16,451 --> 01:07:19,600
that not the three d part,
just the depth part of it.

1792
01:07:19,601 --> 01:07:22,180
So that's what it's going towards.
A bigger screen.

1793
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:24,850
Do you think that they can do that?
Eventually there'll be able to create an

1794
01:07:24,851 --> 01:07:29,851
image that looks three dimensional 
without actually having to have glasses 

1795
01:07:29,851 --> 01:07:29,851
and you see the nintendo three ds?
Yeah.

1796
01:07:29,851 --> 01:07:31,820
They already have it already have it.
but does it look like

1797
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:33,220
you remember when we went to that?
Um,

1798
01:07:33,710 --> 01:07:38,710
I don't remember where,
where the place was we went to and we 

1799
01:07:38,710 --> 01:07:40,591
saw some,
some sort of a big screen was in an 

1800
01:07:40,591 --> 01:07:40,591
austin.
They had a big screen that was,

1801
01:07:40,591 --> 01:07:42,070
um,
it was a three d thing.

1802
01:07:42,100 --> 01:07:44,950
They have super dope.
It was in best buy somewhere in.

1803
01:07:45,220 --> 01:07:45,660
Oh yeah,
yeah,

1804
01:07:45,670 --> 01:07:46,300
yeah,
yeah.

1805
01:07:46,301 --> 01:07:47,470
It was.
Remember they had,

1806
01:07:47,530 --> 01:07:50,080
it was incredible.
We were watching that monsters.

1807
01:07:50,290 --> 01:07:51,480
Monsters versus aliens.
Yeah,

1808
01:07:51,530 --> 01:07:51,970
yeah,
yeah.

1809
01:07:52,120 --> 01:07:55,930
It was insane.
The depth was so fucking gripping.

1810
01:07:56,170 --> 01:08:01,170
I was like,
this is like given me like a mental 

1811
01:08:01,170 --> 01:08:02,620
boanerges to watches like thrilling.
So now it's like it's so alive with like

1812
01:08:02,650 --> 01:08:03,690
visuals,
you know?

1813
01:08:03,750 --> 01:08:05,710
Your story doesn't always have to be the
most original thing,

1814
01:08:05,711 --> 01:08:08,380
but if you can provide something silver 
somebody never seen before,

1815
01:08:08,381 --> 01:08:10,300
that's why we play games.
That's why we go to the movies,

1816
01:08:10,301 --> 01:08:11,680
just to get away from the shitty day to 
day,

1817
01:08:11,681 --> 01:08:16,681
monday life.
That's why there are people who love 

1818
01:08:16,681 --> 01:08:16,681
avatar so much that are when they leave 
it right,

1819
01:08:16,681 --> 01:08:17,930
because they created this whole virtual 
world.

1820
01:08:17,931 --> 01:08:19,880
They just wanted to do exist as me.
Man.

1821
01:08:19,881 --> 01:08:22,220
I wanted to go there.
I wanted to lead.

1822
01:08:22,250 --> 01:08:23,450
When I read about that movie,
I'm like,

1823
01:08:24,220 --> 01:08:25,530
it is like the.

1824
01:08:25,680 --> 01:08:28,390
So it's blue people means for golly,
and I'm watching.

1825
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:29,460
I'm like,
oh this is cool.

1826
01:08:29,461 --> 01:08:31,040
That was a perfect example of depth 
though.

1827
01:08:31,041 --> 01:08:36,041
When you saw avatar for the first time,
how like that one scene where they're 

1828
01:08:36,041 --> 01:08:39,371
going down,
they're pulling out something like a 

1829
01:08:39,371 --> 01:08:39,560
dead body or something like that.
Long hallway,

1830
01:08:39,900 --> 01:08:41,300
you know?
That's what it seems like.

1831
01:08:41,301 --> 01:08:46,301
Everything that I've been watching 
regular tv in bed for like a couple 

1832
01:08:46,301 --> 01:08:47,780
months now and even like regular tv 
shows that,

1833
01:08:47,840 --> 01:08:52,160
that they have like a reaction that 
makes the tv try to make it in three d,

1834
01:08:52,520 --> 01:08:57,080
that reenactment recreation of trying to
make it three and even shows like that.

1835
01:08:57,081 --> 01:08:58,700
You're just watching tv and you're like,
wow,

1836
01:08:58,701 --> 01:09:01,430
this background is really far back.
You know,

1837
01:09:01,460 --> 01:09:06,460
so it seems like everything is going for
depth nowadays that the technology is 

1838
01:09:06,460 --> 01:09:11,081
going to be like us in a pod and we're 
just going to sit there and get 

1839
01:09:11,081 --> 01:09:11,081
communicated back.

1840
01:09:11,180 --> 01:09:13,550
Exactly.
That's what it seems like we used to the

1841
01:09:13,580 --> 01:09:14,840
what?
That they can't go back.

1842
01:09:15,110 --> 01:09:16,940
So it is with hd are familiar right now.
Right.

1843
01:09:16,941 --> 01:09:21,941
But never underestimate how many people 
don't have the money or the upgraded 

1844
01:09:21,941 --> 01:09:22,040
conversation I ever said.
Sorry.

1845
01:09:22,220 --> 01:09:23,610
We don't like we,
we,

1846
01:09:23,630 --> 01:09:26,210
we can track how many people have hd 
versus standard definition,

1847
01:09:26,211 --> 01:09:28,060
televisions and games.
Right?

1848
01:09:28,070 --> 01:09:33,070
Based on their settings.
And it's actually not as many people as 

1849
01:09:33,070 --> 01:09:36,221
you think have hdtv still to this day,
they still have a great percentage of 

1850
01:09:36,221 --> 01:09:36,500
rural America that's still doesn't have 
broadband.

1851
01:09:36,950 --> 01:09:41,950
Right?
There's so many people that lag behind 

1852
01:09:41,950 --> 01:09:41,950
it because it's just not a priority for 
them.

1853
01:09:41,950 --> 01:09:41,950
Right.
You'll always get your early adopters.

1854
01:09:41,950 --> 01:09:44,240
You guys like you who have 3d.
There's still tons of people out there.

1855
01:09:44,241 --> 01:09:47,610
Like I stream all my stuff on my xbox,
like when I saw the red box,

1856
01:09:47,611 --> 01:09:49,160
you go to the supermarket,
we're out where I live,

1857
01:09:49,161 --> 01:09:54,161
and like a friday night or the college,
there's a line out the door at the for 

1858
01:09:54,161 --> 01:09:54,161
the red box.

1859
01:09:54,161 --> 01:09:54,161
And I'm like,
what is this?

1860
01:09:54,161 --> 01:09:54,950
Right?
It's just,

1861
01:09:54,951 --> 01:09:59,951
it's,
it's blockbuster condensed into one box 

1862
01:09:59,951 --> 01:09:59,951
that you just read.
Right.

1863
01:09:59,951 --> 01:10:03,221
And it's huge.
Not everybody has the broadband and has 

1864
01:10:03,221 --> 01:10:06,371
an xbox set up.
They can easily stream everything from 

1865
01:10:06,371 --> 01:10:06,371
the comfort of their living room.
Right?

1866
01:10:06,371 --> 01:10:06,680
But not everybody had electricity 200 
years ago.

1867
01:10:06,780 --> 01:10:08,180
Yeah.
I mean it's like it's all,

1868
01:10:08,210 --> 01:10:09,440
oh,
we got to keep pushing forward.

1869
01:10:09,450 --> 01:10:12,290
Right?
So going to eventually going in the same

1870
01:10:12,291 --> 01:10:17,291
direction.
It doesn't matter how many of these 

1871
01:10:17,291 --> 01:10:17,420
hillbilly fucks don't catch up with no 
broadband in 2010.

1872
01:10:17,421 --> 01:10:20,900
I got no fucking time for you,
but you need to move stupid.

1873
01:10:21,330 --> 01:10:24,020
You know you need to fucking get your 
family out of the woods soon.

1874
01:10:24,500 --> 01:10:29,500
Come on buddy.
It's like there's not going to be 

1875
01:10:29,500 --> 01:10:30,941
carpenters anymore though.
It seems like you were saying like if 

1876
01:10:30,941 --> 01:10:33,671
you want to be a carpenter,
like how is this person going to find 

1877
01:10:33,671 --> 01:10:33,671
like a his job and stuff?

1878
01:10:33,671 --> 01:10:35,360
That's what's going to happen.
There's not going to be houses anymore.

1879
01:10:35,361 --> 01:10:40,361
We're going to live in pods.
Where will we have gigantic three d 

1880
01:10:40,361 --> 01:10:43,580
computers or three d printers that we 
set up that build a house?

1881
01:10:43,581 --> 01:10:44,900
Is that what it will be?
There'll be something.

1882
01:10:45,080 --> 01:10:50,080
It'd be like a cocoon of a third 
dimension wall that wraps around your 

1883
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:50,470
body.
You don't want to live like that.

1884
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:52,760
You're not going to be able to live a 
bomber style,

1885
01:10:53,350 --> 01:10:54,940
but what if you're young and you grew up
with that?

1886
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:59,960
You don't need that much space and you 
prefer the virtual world over the real 

1887
01:10:59,960 --> 01:10:59,960
world.
Right,

1888
01:10:59,960 --> 01:11:03,161
and you're.
You're perfectly comfortable running 

1889
01:11:03,161 --> 01:11:03,470
around a virtual field for a real one 
and wouldn't be going to be inevitable.

1890
01:11:03,530 --> 01:11:08,530
Maybe it will be.
Get so dope that why would you want to 

1891
01:11:08,530 --> 01:11:08,530
live in the real world?
Stupid.

1892
01:11:08,530 --> 01:11:11,020
Maybe the the,
the fake world will be so talked about.

1893
01:11:11,900 --> 01:11:14,120
What if you could just go and you 
remember when

1894
01:11:14,120 --> 01:11:19,120
her virtual reality was all the rage in 
the noodles with a giant dick and and 

1895
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:23,331
eyes that can see through walls and 
there's no racists and racism and 

1896
01:11:23,331 --> 01:11:25,050
perhaps some money that has ever been 
printed.

1897
01:11:25,051 --> 01:11:26,610
It's all yours.
No penis.

1898
01:11:26,611 --> 01:11:29,880
We all have faulty penises and you can 
just go to other world.

1899
01:11:29,881 --> 01:11:31,560
You can travel to other worlds.
You can do anything.

1900
01:11:31,561 --> 01:11:33,210
It's not real.
We can make it their own world,

1901
01:11:33,211 --> 01:11:35,680
right?
That's the million dollar per billion to

1902
01:11:35,681 --> 01:11:37,340
a trillion dollar prize.
Everybody wants to go for,

1903
01:11:37,341 --> 01:11:39,540
for games to give you that your dream 
that you can ultimately control.

1904
01:11:39,720 --> 01:11:40,920
Well,
let's think about this man.

1905
01:11:40,950 --> 01:11:42,420
I mean,
what is imagination?

1906
01:11:42,421 --> 01:11:47,421
Imagination is some sort of energy that 
allows you to think up something that 

1907
01:11:47,421 --> 01:11:49,440
isn't there and create it and now it 
becomes real.

1908
01:11:49,441 --> 01:11:52,500
It manifests itself in the real three 
dimensional world and you can beat on it

1909
01:11:52,501 --> 01:11:52,980
with a hammer.

1910
01:11:53,010 --> 01:11:58,010
It all comes from imagination.
So imagination is like some real 

1911
01:11:58,010 --> 01:12:01,821
creating force were,
but nobody really ever knows where that 

1912
01:12:01,821 --> 01:12:04,371
comes from.
is it coming to your environment is 

1913
01:12:04,371 --> 01:12:04,371
coming from like what you're exposed to,
like what is it?

1914
01:12:04,371 --> 01:12:08,040
Well,
they also the concept of the muse that 

1915
01:12:08,040 --> 01:12:08,520
the urine antenna and that you're tuning
into all the energy that's out there and

1916
01:12:08,521 --> 01:12:09,270
I'll just,
you know,

1917
01:12:09,271 --> 01:12:11,700
you just sort of some sort of another 
process.

1918
01:12:11,701 --> 01:12:12,650
it just like,
you know,

1919
01:12:12,651 --> 01:12:16,110
like a satellite dish pulls it out of 
the sky and makes these numbers ones and

1920
01:12:16,111 --> 01:12:18,150
zeros and do this.
But it's true.

1921
01:12:18,330 --> 01:12:20,700
I mean when you,
when you Look at what imagination is,

1922
01:12:20,701 --> 01:12:22,890
I mean it really is some sort of an 
energy,

1923
01:12:22,891 --> 01:12:26,640
something that exists in the mind and 
that it's ether role and then it becomes

1924
01:12:26,641 --> 01:12:28,320
a solid thing.
It becomes a miller lite,

1925
01:12:28,520 --> 01:12:29,670
you know,
becomes a computer,

1926
01:12:29,671 --> 01:12:31,260
it becomes a microphone,
you know,

1927
01:12:31,261 --> 01:12:36,261
and this,
all this is eventually got to move 

1928
01:12:36,261 --> 01:12:36,261
further.

1929
01:12:36,261 --> 01:12:37,410
Right?
So if,

1930
01:12:37,590 --> 01:12:42,590
if the imagination of all these thoughts
can become a real thing by someone 

1931
01:12:42,590 --> 01:12:44,340
getting out and and sawing some wood and
nailing some things together,

1932
01:12:44,580 --> 01:12:49,580
eventually it's going to become 
something through code where you can 

1933
01:12:49,580 --> 01:12:50,430
alter things not with a hammer and 
nails,

1934
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:55,640
but you can use your mind to create a 
real world that could be 100 percent 

1935
01:12:56,131 --> 01:13:01,131
real with your imagination applied 
operating system that tunes into neural 

1936
01:13:01,131 --> 01:13:05,721
interface and becomes a part of you and 
you and this operating system connect to

1937
01:13:06,061 --> 01:13:08,670
some sort of a computer or whatever the 
fuck it is,

1938
01:13:08,671 --> 01:13:13,671
whether it's wireless or whatever,
and then all of a sudden you enter into 

1939
01:13:13,671 --> 01:13:15,810
a tangible third dimensional three 
dimensional world that you control.

1940
01:13:16,140 --> 01:13:18,780
Then you upload it into it.
What the fuck man?

1941
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:21,510
And we leave meetspace right?
Space,

1942
01:13:21,580 --> 01:13:26,580
but think about what happens when the 
meat dies and he's just rot and then 

1943
01:13:26,580 --> 01:13:26,580
someone has to come along and clean you.

1944
01:13:26,580 --> 01:13:28,560
They have to recognize as a whole in the
matrix and see you fight it weird.

1945
01:13:28,561 --> 01:13:31,830
That is 2010 and we still bury people in
the ground scam.

1946
01:13:32,570 --> 01:13:37,570
We should address those people up and 
fucking dancing around like we need to 

1947
01:13:37,681 --> 01:13:39,090
burn them when you're talking about 
stupid.

1948
01:13:39,780 --> 01:13:44,780
I think that'd be a play.
They should be the respect for the guy 

1949
01:13:44,780 --> 01:13:46,380
and it's like six months long.
So crazy.

1950
01:13:46,830 --> 01:13:48,130
You got to burn them.
It's so dominant.

1951
01:13:48,150 --> 01:13:49,800
The cost.
So much money to bury people.

1952
01:13:49,801 --> 01:13:51,690
Man.
I was at the duncan show,

1953
01:13:51,691 --> 01:13:52,200
the,
uh,

1954
01:13:52,201 --> 01:13:53,140
at the cemetery.
Yeah.

1955
01:13:53,190 --> 01:13:54,090
What's it called?
Uh,

1956
01:13:54,091 --> 01:13:59,091
the hollywood cemetery.
It's got some weird show he does at the 

1957
01:13:59,091 --> 01:13:59,310
hollywood sign.
I had the gears launch party.

1958
01:13:59,311 --> 01:13:59,680
Yeah.
Yeah.

1959
01:13:59,760 --> 01:14:01,350
That's where the gears are that sign,
this form.

1960
01:14:01,380 --> 01:14:02,670
They do movies and shit there.
Yeah,

1961
01:14:02,671 --> 01:14:03,720
it's awesome.
It's like a hip,

1962
01:14:03,721 --> 01:14:06,130
really weird cemetery.
But they comedy,

1963
01:14:06,150 --> 01:14:07,980
they do a comedy show there and we were 
there.

1964
01:14:07,981 --> 01:14:10,040
And so it was the first time I'd ever 
been around,

1965
01:14:10,050 --> 01:14:11,770
um,
uh,

1966
01:14:12,040 --> 01:14:14,200
gravestones in a long time and they'll 
like,

1967
01:14:14,230 --> 01:14:19,230
they'll all high tech now.
They'll have like laser etched people's 

1968
01:14:19,230 --> 01:14:22,081
faces and shit into the gravestones.
Did they have like video screens and 

1969
01:14:22,081 --> 01:14:25,051
stuff like the sopranos and stuff like 
that on the laws and like Harry Potter 

1970
01:14:26,051 --> 01:14:31,051
inside the.
Inside the what I'm talking about where 

1971
01:14:31,051 --> 01:14:31,051
the dead people are.
Yeah.

1972
01:14:31,051 --> 01:14:31,051
Where the dead people are.
The,

1973
01:14:31,051 --> 01:14:31,800
the headstones there,
there,

1974
01:14:31,810 --> 01:14:32,430
there,
there,

1975
01:14:32,431 --> 01:14:34,090
there were like high tech now.
Yeah.

1976
01:14:34,240 --> 01:14:36,790
Like the whole place is like,
just like a trendy place like that.

1977
01:14:36,791 --> 01:14:41,791
So even there's like neon lights around 
like some of the graves and there's 

1978
01:14:41,791 --> 01:14:41,950
these digital candles that flick.
It's like this,

1979
01:14:42,130 --> 01:14:43,450
like a hip,
you know,

1980
01:14:43,530 --> 01:14:45,550
you do is ridiculous.
What you do is if you die,

1981
01:14:45,551 --> 01:14:50,551
you have a live streaming thing that as 
a twitter hashtag with your names to 

1982
01:14:50,551 --> 01:14:50,551
shout outs.
Yeah,

1983
01:14:50,551 --> 01:14:55,411
totally.
I wouldn't give a shout out the 

1984
01:14:55,411 --> 01:14:55,411
gravestone number.
Forty two.

1985
01:14:55,411 --> 01:14:55,411
Everybody who died,
he still has a facebook.

1986
01:14:57,970 --> 01:15:01,040
Oh his wife updates is facebook all the 
time.

1987
01:15:01,270 --> 01:15:04,270
You and shit like that.
I've known people in.

1988
01:15:04,271 --> 01:15:05,090
It's weird.
They,

1989
01:15:05,130 --> 01:15:10,130
they almost hot you on facebook.
They keep popping up and like and stuff 

1990
01:15:10,130 --> 01:15:11,020
that aren't tagged like tagged me and 
it's just a.

1991
01:15:11,350 --> 01:15:13,650
You'll be in the middle of the day just 
eating your lunch and it just pops up.

1992
01:15:13,680 --> 01:15:14,470
You're like,
oh man.

1993
01:15:14,471 --> 01:15:16,000
Like it's a weird,
sobering reminder in.

1994
01:15:16,010 --> 01:15:18,940
You're not going to delete it.
It's this weird kind of ghostly memorial

1995
01:15:18,941 --> 01:15:19,810
to that person.
Right.

1996
01:15:19,940 --> 01:15:24,940
And the trivial way.
what happens when that person starts 

1997
01:15:24,940 --> 01:15:28,831
responding though,
and it's not like there's a twilight 

1998
01:15:28,831 --> 01:15:28,831
zone,
right?

1999
01:15:28,831 --> 01:15:32,130
It starts with the poke right button and
you're like,

2000
01:15:32,861 --> 01:15:37,861
I think the assence kicking in,
there's this article in fast company 

2001
01:15:37,861 --> 01:15:40,921
talkIng about how twitter is kind of 
taken over in certain ways and how 

2002
01:15:40,921 --> 01:15:41,740
basically during the maze this year they
had like twitter projections on the wall

2003
01:15:41,741 --> 01:15:44,590
of like the number of hits like each 
artist got and there had life youth,

2004
01:15:44,591 --> 01:15:46,700
what people are saying about each artist
and so we're.

2005
01:15:46,700 --> 01:15:49,450
We have a generation right now that 
wants to interact 24 slash seven.

2006
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:52,720
it started with the remote control and 
now like it's not enough.

2007
01:15:52,721 --> 01:15:57,721
I know friends who've been sitting there
texting other people and I'll say 

2008
01:15:57,721 --> 01:15:57,721
something like,
hey,

2009
01:15:57,721 --> 01:15:58,150
do you wanna go to the you wanna go to 
the store and they'll be like,

2010
01:15:58,151 --> 01:15:59,530
did you actually hear what I what I just
said?

2011
01:15:59,531 --> 01:16:00,310
And they'll be like,
yeah,

2012
01:16:00,311 --> 01:16:05,311
you said you wanna go to the store while
they're in the middle of typing an 

2013
01:16:05,311 --> 01:16:07,171
email.
the human mind is adapting to this kind 

2014
01:16:07,171 --> 01:16:09,781
of multitask ability.
It's not just enough to sit down and 

2015
01:16:09,781 --> 01:16:09,781
watch something you need to.
You need to a her feet,

2016
01:16:09,781 --> 01:16:14,031
you know,
we're playing an online game and in 

2017
01:16:14,031 --> 01:16:14,031
between rounds were tweeting at the same
time.

2018
01:16:14,031 --> 01:16:17,641
Right.
You have to keep doing something and 

2019
01:16:17,641 --> 01:16:17,641
doing multiple things.
Otherwise the brain is bored.

2020
01:16:17,641 --> 01:16:18,550
You know what?
I don't think it affects traffic as much

2021
01:16:18,580 --> 01:16:21,780
either because I think the majority of 
people that have like the,

2022
01:16:21,800 --> 01:16:22,470
the,
the,

2023
01:16:22,750 --> 01:16:27,750
the google maps,
live traffic view sorts that out from 

2024
01:16:27,750 --> 01:16:29,440
people that are just sitting there,
twittering our mom and driving slower.

2025
01:16:29,460 --> 01:16:33,010
Like it cancels each other out because 
now we have better technology so we know

2026
01:16:33,011 --> 01:16:35,230
where to drive better and where the 
traffic is.

2027
01:16:35,410 --> 01:16:40,410
So that equals out the other retards,
they just sitting there twittering and 

2028
01:16:40,410 --> 01:16:41,800
slowing down traffic at different way.
So what do you think about that?

2029
01:16:42,770 --> 01:16:47,770
Your steering wheel with a shit about 
your phone to the center of your 

2030
01:16:47,770 --> 01:16:47,770
steering wheel.
Now I did.

2031
01:16:47,770 --> 01:16:49,770
I just did this side straddle thing.
I looked down at the map.

2032
01:16:49,800 --> 01:16:51,010
I'm like,
okay,

2033
01:16:51,500 --> 01:16:53,790
gotta turn right up.
You're at the point where like you're,

2034
01:16:53,980 --> 01:16:56,410
you could feel the tug of your phone in 
your pocket sometimes.

2035
01:16:56,420 --> 01:16:57,700
Oh yeah.
We're just like,

2036
01:16:57,701 --> 01:16:58,530
oh,
I just want to look,

2037
01:16:58,570 --> 01:17:03,570
you know,
having a twitter fan base and just 

2038
01:17:03,570 --> 01:17:03,570
seeing you,
you,

2039
01:17:03,570 --> 01:17:03,750
you post something before you leave the 
office or whatever and you're driving on

2040
01:17:03,751 --> 01:17:08,751
the road,
you just learn to know what they're 

2041
01:17:08,751 --> 01:17:08,751
going to say.
Right,

2042
01:17:08,751 --> 01:17:08,751
right.
I just want to respond to that in itself

2043
01:17:08,751 --> 01:17:08,830
is having a communitY,
right?

2044
01:17:09,050 --> 01:17:14,050
That's incredibly addictive.
So if you have an instant response from 

2045
01:17:14,050 --> 01:17:14,050
thousands,
if not hundreds of thousands of people,

2046
01:17:14,240 --> 01:17:19,240
right?
Like how could you not want to know if 

2047
01:17:19,240 --> 01:17:20,501
they're gonna say and half the time it's
the same thing and half the time it's 

2048
01:17:20,501 --> 01:17:20,501
something new.
Right?

2049
01:17:20,501 --> 01:17:20,720
Totally.
Yeah.

2050
01:17:20,721 --> 01:17:22,760
It's very addictive,
very addictive,

2051
01:17:22,820 --> 01:17:27,820
just wanting to know what's going on 
Because every now and then I'll check 

2052
01:17:27,820 --> 01:17:27,820
twitter and someone will turn me onto 
something really amazing.

2053
01:17:27,820 --> 01:17:32,520
Right.
You know some incredible fucking video 

2054
01:17:32,520 --> 01:17:32,520
or something.

2055
01:17:32,520 --> 01:17:32,520
A little weirded out by the links 
though.

2056
01:17:32,520 --> 01:17:32,690
Like you just worry about clicking on 
it.

2057
01:17:32,691 --> 01:17:33,020
Like,
hey,

2058
01:17:33,021 --> 01:17:38,021
check out this video.
This cat who farts while he burps and 

2059
01:17:38,021 --> 01:17:38,021
you're like,
Macedonia.

2060
01:17:38,021 --> 01:17:38,021
Do you have,
don't you use a mac?

2061
01:17:38,021 --> 01:17:41,640
No.
Oh my,

2062
01:17:41,690 --> 01:17:42,290
my,
my,

2063
01:17:42,370 --> 01:17:44,660
the big,
the big apple cherry popper from you was

2064
01:17:44,661 --> 01:17:45,890
the ipad man.
Oh yeah,

2065
01:17:45,891 --> 01:17:46,520
totally.
I love it.

2066
01:17:46,670 --> 01:17:48,130
Yeah.
You got to get mammograms.

2067
01:17:48,250 --> 01:17:50,540
The not clicking on links nowadays.
Who cares?

2068
01:17:50,541 --> 01:17:52,120
Right.
You don't worry about viruses.

2069
01:17:52,121 --> 01:17:54,260
Don't worry about anything.
I'm still a pc guy.

2070
01:17:54,270 --> 01:17:55,570
That's what we develop on at work.
Right.

2071
01:17:55,571 --> 01:17:57,480
That's all nice.
But it's nonsense.

2072
01:17:58,410 --> 01:17:59,490
Yeah.
You got to have dessert.

2073
01:17:59,510 --> 01:18:04,510
Like being a person who's allergic to 
peanuts and you're eating everything 

2074
01:18:04,510 --> 01:18:04,820
blind,
hoping you don't run into a peanut.

2075
01:18:04,850 --> 01:18:05,480
Yeah.
fair enough.

2076
01:18:05,481 --> 01:18:06,530
No,
it's silly,

2077
01:18:07,690 --> 01:18:09,920
right?
Is this ustream.tv

2078
01:18:09,921 --> 01:18:11,990
or [inaudible] dot net.tv.
Fuck.

2079
01:18:12,870 --> 01:18:13,340
What's the difference?

2080
01:18:13,430 --> 01:18:15,620
The wrong link on my twitter page.
You put it up for you.

2081
01:18:16,170 --> 01:18:20,180
I'll put up the wrong length.
These people can't take the piss anytime

2082
01:18:20,181 --> 01:18:23,380
you want to get up here.
Just business wise for cables.

2083
01:18:25,010 --> 01:18:26,210
He's been here before,
man.

2084
01:18:26,240 --> 01:18:27,920
Trust me,
if you want to pee on my dog,

2085
01:18:27,921 --> 01:18:29,800
she's out back.
She likes iT.

2086
01:18:31,290 --> 01:18:36,290
Dogs love p man.
You know what's crazy about video games 

2087
01:18:36,290 --> 01:18:36,420
nowadays is that angry birds game.
There's a bird,

2088
01:18:36,570 --> 01:18:38,240
a game.
I don't knoW if you heard that.

2089
01:18:38,300 --> 01:18:40,670
ninety nine cents right now.
I think it is,

2090
01:18:40,820 --> 01:18:45,240
but that game is sold so many fucking 
ninety nine cent apps that.

2091
01:18:45,320 --> 01:18:50,320
What does it look like?
Spielberg is going to be making a movie 

2092
01:18:50,320 --> 01:18:50,320
with brad pitt any day now as an angry 
bird or something.

2093
01:18:50,320 --> 01:18:52,370
That's how crazy you know what you're 
talking about.

2094
01:18:53,250 --> 01:18:55,850
This is a game on a that you can get on 
your iphone.

2095
01:18:55,850 --> 01:18:57,620
You could also get it on the droid and 
stuff like that.

2096
01:18:57,621 --> 01:18:59,430
it's called angry birds.
Uh,

2097
01:18:59,450 --> 01:19:04,450
it's so has sold like shitloads of 
digital copies to the point where that 

2098
01:19:04,611 --> 01:19:09,611
game,
it's like making millions for a ninety 

2099
01:19:09,611 --> 01:19:12,700
nine cent video game.
It's gotten so big that now they're 

2100
01:19:12,700 --> 01:19:12,800
making it for ipads.
They're making it first console's,

2101
01:19:12,801 --> 01:19:16,880
but now it's like there's even a movie 
maybe in the works that's coming out.

2102
01:19:16,910 --> 01:19:19,460
So what does with the numbers,
like how many millions?

2103
01:19:19,490 --> 01:19:21,080
Millions.
Lost millions.

2104
01:19:21,081 --> 01:19:21,970
Yeah.
Yeah.

2105
01:19:22,160 --> 01:19:25,250
What would you say?
Three point $7 million today.

2106
01:19:25,280 --> 01:19:30,280
just taking ralphie may.
that's what we're going to call them 

2107
01:19:30,280 --> 01:19:30,280
now.
It's a.

2108
01:19:30,280 --> 01:19:33,620
Ralphie may make up a number.
I'm going to ralph number.

2109
01:19:35,650 --> 01:19:40,650
Remember that?
And then we looked up to thousands of 

2110
01:19:40,650 --> 01:19:44,770
people started as black as coal people 
died.

2111
01:19:48,170 --> 01:19:53,170
Gang ralph.
He's a great guy and he's very funny but

2112
01:19:53,850 --> 01:19:55,320
still fucks with numbers.
You know,

2113
01:19:55,340 --> 01:19:56,900
he's not where he doesn't suck it 
numbers.

2114
01:19:57,110 --> 01:19:59,780
His popularity of that episode is one of
the fastest,

2115
01:19:59,781 --> 01:20:02,450
most popular episodes.
Popular man.

2116
01:20:02,451 --> 01:20:05,270
we had so many people love crazy mad 
fans.

2117
01:20:05,890 --> 01:20:07,690
Ralphy ralphie

2118
01:20:08,510 --> 01:20:13,510
and this was ralph.
He was the one who was the best at 

2119
01:20:13,510 --> 01:20:13,950
capitalizing on that last comic standing
show.

2120
01:20:13,980 --> 01:20:16,490
He did it better than anybody.
He just ran with that shit.

2121
01:20:16,870 --> 01:20:20,300
like I said this on the podcast,
he watched them destroy rooms,

2122
01:20:20,301 --> 01:20:25,301
like just howling,
like a show on the show and that's what 

2123
01:20:25,301 --> 01:20:25,680
made me got into thinking like,
wow,

2124
01:20:25,681 --> 01:20:27,870
he is,
he is a real comic,

2125
01:20:27,871 --> 01:20:29,520
or here's an animal dude.
that dude,

2126
01:20:29,521 --> 01:20:31,740
I mean he might be 500 fucking pounds or
whatever it is,

2127
01:20:31,741 --> 01:20:34,350
but he's working.
he's out there constantly huffing it.

2128
01:20:34,410 --> 01:20:36,260
I heard he did like three hours shows 
too.

2129
01:20:36,300 --> 01:20:38,660
Sometimes.
It's just as ridiculous shows.

2130
01:20:38,670 --> 01:20:40,500
I'm,
I want to know is like stealing a lot of

2131
01:20:40,501 --> 01:20:41,040
comedy,
man.

2132
01:20:41,041 --> 01:20:46,041
He's doing a constantly his feet,
so his feet must hurt that they must 

2133
01:20:46,041 --> 01:20:46,041
have.
They must just fucking anybody sits down

2134
01:20:46,041 --> 01:20:46,041
after awhile.

2135
01:20:46,110 --> 01:20:49,260
Maybe it lays down and it maybe what he 
does this,

2136
01:20:49,590 --> 01:20:54,590
the audience is,
it's like one of those amusement park 

2137
01:20:54,590 --> 01:20:56,961
rides.
They all strap in and they're raised 

2138
01:20:56,961 --> 01:20:58,991
them up over him so they're hanging from
the ceiling and he's lying on his back 

2139
01:20:58,991 --> 01:21:02,361
and that's what he does is common.
And what if he had a waterbed onstage 

2140
01:21:02,361 --> 01:21:03,660
and just laid back in a wider bed and 
there was this candles all around them.

2141
01:21:03,661 --> 01:21:05,410
And then that's how,
that's how I did his whole show.

2142
01:21:06,190 --> 01:21:09,360
Cool fucking idea.
How about just being in the tub?

2143
01:21:09,460 --> 01:21:12,540
Just in the tub with candles comedy.
Oh totally.

2144
01:21:12,541 --> 01:21:17,541
That's actually not a bad idea.
You had your opener in there with you 

2145
01:21:17,541 --> 01:21:18,340
and they're just hanging out laying 
there girls though.

2146
01:21:18,550 --> 01:21:23,550
You only had one person who's funny.
One person who lives you in that camp 

2147
01:21:24,181 --> 01:21:27,930
that thinks girls aren't funny.
Most giRls are not fun comedy thing,

2148
01:21:27,931 --> 01:21:32,931
right?
Like there's a bunch mean sarah 

2149
01:21:32,931 --> 01:21:32,931
silvermans reallY funny.
And so I shouldn't say most girls,

2150
01:21:32,931 --> 01:21:34,080
just.
Most comics are funny either.

2151
01:21:34,081 --> 01:21:38,380
There's less girls doing comedy.
So there's that funny

2152
01:21:38,510 --> 01:21:41,370
comedians that are women.
I mean there's no asterisks.

2153
01:21:41,371 --> 01:21:43,100
FunnY little esther.
She's very funny.

2154
01:21:43,101 --> 01:21:48,101
She's a good comic.
There's a bunch that are really good 

2155
01:21:48,101 --> 01:21:50,201
comics.
I'm gonna have a bunch of friends that 

2156
01:21:50,201 --> 01:21:50,201
are comics that are female.
It's a joke.

2157
01:21:50,201 --> 01:21:53,590
But uh,
there's a lot of women that are 

2158
01:21:53,590 --> 01:21:55,271
terrible.
It's a different to have different 

2159
01:21:55,271 --> 01:21:58,271
restrictions.
They can't talk about as many things 

2160
01:21:58,271 --> 01:21:58,271
that can't leave.
Sarah silverman does,

2161
01:21:58,271 --> 01:21:58,970
but she's such a rarity,
you know,

2162
01:21:58,971 --> 01:22:00,320
most.
But that's kind of what it takes,

2163
01:22:00,321 --> 01:22:05,321
right?
Like he looked at richard pryor sort of 

2164
01:22:05,321 --> 01:22:05,321
class to be you.
It has to be you.

2165
01:22:05,321 --> 01:22:05,960
And so very few women actually are that.
I mean,

2166
01:22:05,961 --> 01:22:06,710
sarah silverman,
the reason,

2167
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:09,470
one of the reasons why she's so funny 
and so brash and dirty,

2168
01:22:09,471 --> 01:22:12,350
it's like that's what's funny to her,
that's who she really is.

2169
01:22:12,950 --> 01:22:14,480
And it has to really be you.

2170
01:22:14,660 --> 01:22:15,410
And there's,
you know,

2171
01:22:15,411 --> 01:22:16,290
for doing an act.
Yeah,

2172
01:22:16,291 --> 01:22:19,160
for a lot of men that's always meant 
men.

2173
01:22:19,370 --> 01:22:21,920
Ninety percent of all men talk about,
you know,

2174
01:22:22,040 --> 01:22:27,040
a lot of the same situations and you 
know that you can relate to anyone even 

2175
01:22:27,040 --> 01:22:31,031
if they're on stage,
unless they're like as extreme as like 

2176
01:22:31,031 --> 01:22:32,860
say joey diaz and until he deals,
we'll take it into the average man 

2177
01:22:32,860 --> 01:22:34,010
really has no.
But for most women,

2178
01:22:34,011 --> 01:22:39,011
you know,
like conversations like men don't want 

2179
01:22:39,011 --> 01:22:39,230
to hear you talk about politics.
Men don't want to hear your opinions.

2180
01:22:39,350 --> 01:22:44,350
Men don't want to hear you talking about
you getting laid and then don't want to 

2181
01:22:44,350 --> 01:22:46,430
hear you talking about like,
what the fuck is this bitch so limited.

2182
01:22:46,431 --> 01:22:48,410
They're limited.
And they can't be the alpha,

2183
01:22:48,500 --> 01:22:53,500
they can't be the one who has this idea 
that maybe everybody should listen to 

2184
01:22:53,500 --> 01:22:53,500
because it makes sense.

2185
01:22:53,500 --> 01:22:57,280
You can't be that person.
The last thing any fucking asshole man 

2186
01:22:57,280 --> 01:22:58,160
wants to do as being the audience with 
some woman's smarter than him.

2187
01:22:58,161 --> 01:23:03,161
That's making a lot of sense.
it's saying some shit that he should 

2188
01:23:03,161 --> 01:23:03,161
have thought up on his own because look,
controlling that.

2189
01:23:03,161 --> 01:23:03,500
Good luck that.
Yeah.

2190
01:23:03,501 --> 01:23:05,470
And good luck with politics.
Know.

2191
01:23:05,471 --> 01:23:08,230
And then I'll always oppose women on 
political issues.

2192
01:23:08,380 --> 01:23:10,690
I know a lot of men who,
when women think one way,

2193
01:23:10,691 --> 01:23:13,090
they'll think the other way,
just because a woman thinks that way.

2194
01:23:13,120 --> 01:23:13,780
It's just like,
you know,

2195
01:23:13,781 --> 01:23:15,340
it's just natural.
It's ingrained.

2196
01:23:15,660 --> 01:23:17,950
It's ingrained to not want a woman to 
control you.

2197
01:23:17,960 --> 01:23:22,960
So.
So many comedians just rely upon the 

2198
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:22,960
whole lake.
Marriage sucks,

2199
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:24,300
like unhappy american male type thing.
Then it's just,

2200
01:23:24,301 --> 01:23:24,830
it's sad.

2201
01:23:25,080 --> 01:23:25,860
Well,
You know what it is.

2202
01:23:25,861 --> 01:23:27,060
It's like,
first of all,

2203
01:23:27,061 --> 01:23:29,160
that is a lot of what they are.
I mean,

2204
01:23:29,161 --> 01:23:34,161
a lot of people,
especially if you're shitty at 

2205
01:23:34,161 --> 01:23:34,161
relationships,
you don't know what I mean.

2206
01:23:34,161 --> 01:23:34,740
You're most.
We know a lot of people that are fucking

2207
01:23:34,741 --> 01:23:36,080
terrible relationships.
yeah.

2208
01:23:36,230 --> 01:23:37,800
It is what it is.
And it's also,

2209
01:23:38,050 --> 01:23:38,730
it's,
you know,

2210
01:23:38,731 --> 01:23:43,731
they,
they get programmed into thinking that 

2211
01:23:43,731 --> 01:23:43,731
that's what's funny.
You know,

2212
01:23:43,731 --> 01:23:44,080
That this is,
this is the angle was what everybody.

2213
01:23:44,370 --> 01:23:46,370
The whole like,
oh my life sucks like that.

2214
01:23:46,371 --> 01:23:47,690
So that's the way it is.
And I,

2215
01:23:47,691 --> 01:23:48,920
I feel sympathy for you.

2216
01:23:49,110 --> 01:23:54,110
Yeah.
But some people will come out with it 

2217
01:23:54,110 --> 01:23:54,110
and you know,
you know,

2218
01:23:54,110 --> 01:23:54,110
it's real,
you know,

2219
01:23:54,110 --> 01:23:58,671
it's like two people can talk about the 
same subjects and why it works and the 

2220
01:23:58,671 --> 01:23:59,970
other one that doesn't.
And the one that works,

2221
01:23:59,971 --> 01:24:02,130
it works because the shit is coming from
a real place.

2222
01:24:02,610 --> 01:24:05,760
That's like the most important thing.
I think any kind of art,

2223
01:24:05,790 --> 01:24:08,760
it's got to come from a real place to 
order to really resonate with people.

2224
01:24:08,761 --> 01:24:10,830
This has to actually be what you want to
do.

2225
01:24:11,080 --> 01:24:12,680
You and I started watching,
uh,

2226
01:24:12,740 --> 01:24:15,710
for about five seconds on cable.
The other night was pauly shore is dead.

2227
01:24:17,900 --> 01:24:19,910
Did you enjoy it now?
I wonder why.

2228
01:24:19,960 --> 01:24:23,030
That's where anything was growing up as 
a teenager.

2229
01:24:23,031 --> 01:24:26,420
We would watch that shit like we would 
watch movies.

2230
01:24:26,490 --> 01:24:31,490
Yeah.
Well pauly shore of Then is not the 

2231
01:24:31,490 --> 01:24:31,490
polisher of.
No,

2232
01:24:31,490 --> 01:24:31,490
no.
Fair enough.

2233
01:24:31,670 --> 01:24:35,150
Life moves on and he's still a go.
Do you go while you worked at the comedy

2234
01:24:35,151 --> 01:24:35,990
store still or no?

2235
01:24:36,070 --> 01:24:36,790
Never.
Never.

2236
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:37,350
Never.
No,

2237
01:24:37,410 --> 01:24:38,140
no,
no.

2238
01:24:38,230 --> 01:24:40,630
That's the main reason why that whole,
uh,

2239
01:24:40,660 --> 01:24:42,640
carlsbad ca thing.
That was the end of it for me.

2240
01:24:42,720 --> 01:24:44,410
Yeah.
I don't want to bring up a little.

2241
01:24:44,980 --> 01:24:49,980
It was just gross.
I mostly do the improv now and other 

2242
01:24:49,980 --> 01:24:49,980
clubs,
but

2243
01:24:49,980 --> 01:24:53,060
you're all right buddy.
What is brian's moving around?

2244
01:24:53,110 --> 01:24:55,550
Down the butter dog was fucking dog.
Wait,

2245
01:24:55,560 --> 01:24:57,000
what?
I miss walking around with his dog.

2246
01:24:57,001 --> 01:25:00,610
We get a suitcase for it.
We're in the middle of a podcaSt.

2247
01:25:00,611 --> 01:25:04,050
he's dazzled perth and just walk around.
You get a dog now?

2248
01:25:04,240 --> 01:25:05,160
Yeah,
I've got a couple dogs.

2249
01:25:05,660 --> 01:25:10,660
Well,
you know my story about when I was 

2250
01:25:10,660 --> 01:25:10,660
living in Colorado,
my dog had eaten by mountain lion,

2251
01:25:10,660 --> 01:25:10,670
but he told me that.
Yeah.

2252
01:25:11,380 --> 01:25:14,580
So I have two left.
I got a master's when I have a bulldog.

2253
01:25:14,740 --> 01:25:16,590
Your master,
a buck 40.

2254
01:25:16,770 --> 01:25:18,000
Jesus.
I'm buck 50.

2255
01:25:18,520 --> 01:25:20,760
He's big,
he's super friendly though.

2256
01:25:21,150 --> 01:25:23,280
Just dog.
The bigger the dog,

2257
01:25:23,281 --> 01:25:24,160
the nicer they are.
The media there.

2258
01:25:24,161 --> 01:25:25,200
Are there more little shits?
Well,

2259
01:25:25,201 --> 01:25:26,640
there's some big dogs that are scary 
though,

2260
01:25:26,641 --> 01:25:28,170
like pressing scenarios,
you know,

2261
01:25:28,200 --> 01:25:28,920
there's,
there's some,

2262
01:25:28,980 --> 01:25:33,980
there's some giant dogs that are fucking
dangerous that usually the masters and 

2263
01:25:33,980 --> 01:25:33,980
the danes are cool,
right?

2264
01:25:33,980 --> 01:25:34,020
Yeah.
Great.

2265
01:25:34,021 --> 01:25:36,060
Danes are also really confident.
They're really friendly,

2266
01:25:36,270 --> 01:25:39,750
but mastiffs like this dog is the best.
He's just got the perfect personality.

2267
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,370
So she's so sweet to everybody.
It's just a nice.

2268
01:25:42,500 --> 01:25:44,370
I can't do the little dog thing man and 
know how you do it.

2269
01:25:44,730 --> 01:25:45,510
Well,
the little dogs,

2270
01:25:45,511 --> 01:25:48,360
the one that got eaten and I had a cool 
little dog man.

2271
01:25:48,361 --> 01:25:50,610
He was a pomeranian and american 
eskimos.

2272
01:25:50,820 --> 01:25:53,310
Fluffy dog,
but he got jacked by mountain lion.

2273
01:25:53,850 --> 01:25:56,270
Did he just vanish one day or do you 
come crawling halfway?

2274
01:25:56,290 --> 01:25:58,650
Like this story that we've told many 
times

2275
01:26:00,200 --> 01:26:03,500
I,
I saw the mountain lion was having,

2276
01:26:03,530 --> 01:26:05,630
you know,
having little dogs lIke that.

2277
01:26:05,631 --> 01:26:06,440
It's like,
you know,

2278
01:26:06,630 --> 01:26:08,570
they really can't protect themselves 
from anything.

2279
01:26:08,680 --> 01:26:10,040
Foxes can jack.
Um,

2280
01:26:10,340 --> 01:26:10,790
we,
you know,

2281
01:26:10,791 --> 01:26:13,560
I saw a fox with the little baby deer.
I didn't know,

2282
01:26:13,561 --> 01:26:16,180
like everybody was talking about how fox
is or like sweet.

2283
01:26:16,220 --> 01:26:18,350
Oh they're so cool.
Look at the fantasy five too.

2284
01:26:18,390 --> 01:26:20,840
Then I saw a fox dragging a font and I 
was like,

2285
01:26:20,900 --> 01:26:22,430
oh,
this is real shit.

2286
01:26:22,431 --> 01:26:24,340
You ever actually get to be around into 
the big katzman?

2287
01:26:24,610 --> 01:26:29,610
Well I saw this one mountain lion that 
was in my yard and it was about 60 

2288
01:26:29,610 --> 01:26:29,750
pounds,
70 pounds.

2289
01:26:29,751 --> 01:26:33,140
It was like a dog,
like a german shepherd size wasn't big.

2290
01:26:33,141 --> 01:26:34,010
Like,
like,

2291
01:26:34,040 --> 01:26:35,570
holy shit,
this is going to eat me.

2292
01:26:35,720 --> 01:26:36,530
It was big,
like,

2293
01:26:37,040 --> 01:26:38,450
whoa,
that's a mountain lion.

2294
01:26:38,451 --> 01:26:43,451
It was like,
it was almost kinda like more shocking 

2295
01:26:43,451 --> 01:26:44,090
that it was smaller because then I knew 
it was real.

2296
01:26:44,210 --> 01:26:46,050
you know what I'm saying?
Like I expected if you're going to see a

2297
01:26:46,051 --> 01:26:46,680
mountain lion,
I must,

2298
01:26:46,681 --> 01:26:51,681
he a full grown mountain lion walking 
through the woods and something about 

2299
01:26:51,681 --> 01:26:51,860
the small one.
And I was like,

2300
01:26:51,861 --> 01:26:53,510
whoa.
Like there's small ones too.

2301
01:26:53,511 --> 01:26:55,460
Like how many of them are out there?
I started thinking like,

2302
01:26:55,730 --> 01:26:58,580
how many of these fucking creatures will
live in the woods and just kill it.

2303
01:26:59,120 --> 01:27:01,390
I had a cat killed by a economy.
I think it was a coyote,

2304
01:27:01,400 --> 01:27:03,970
one of my mom's place and tIme.
And you hear them at night,

2305
01:27:03,971 --> 01:27:08,971
right?
You just hear all the howling start 

2306
01:27:08,971 --> 01:27:08,971
kicking in,
right?

2307
01:27:08,971 --> 01:27:08,971
Yeah.

2308
01:27:08,971 --> 01:27:11,670
Yard sometimes or they used to be.
I had a fixed my yard so they couldn't 

2309
01:27:11,670 --> 01:27:11,670
get in,
but they would,

2310
01:27:11,670 --> 01:27:15,811
uh,
they would get in and they would ship 

2311
01:27:15,811 --> 01:27:15,811
all over the place.
They would shit over by my pool.

2312
01:27:15,811 --> 01:27:17,310
And it was creepy man,
because I stay up late dude.

2313
01:27:17,311 --> 01:27:18,730
Yeah.
I'm up til like 4:00

2314
01:27:18,731 --> 01:27:21,190
in the morning.
so while I'm writing,

2315
01:27:21,310 --> 01:27:26,310
you know,
these fucking monsters are wandering 

2316
01:27:26,310 --> 01:27:26,310
around my yard.
Look over shift.

2317
01:27:26,310 --> 01:27:26,310
Yeah.
But if you're out there,

2318
01:27:26,310 --> 01:27:27,250
they probably the you there and they do 
avoid it.

2319
01:27:27,280 --> 01:27:28,200
Right.
You know?

2320
01:27:28,210 --> 01:27:28,840
Yeah.
But,

2321
01:27:28,900 --> 01:27:29,450
you know,
don't,

2322
01:27:29,500 --> 01:27:32,080
don't fucking take a chance with a small
person if there's no one around.

2323
01:27:32,110 --> 01:27:34,010
Dude,
I chance people before I,

2324
01:27:34,011 --> 01:27:35,680
uh,
I had a chance to take my brother and my

2325
01:27:35,681 --> 01:27:40,681
little,
a seven year old niece at the san diego 

2326
01:27:40,681 --> 01:27:43,111
zoo or the wild animal park and kind of 
go behind the scenes to check out the 

2327
01:27:43,111 --> 01:27:44,140
whole sheet set up there and uh,
there's one sheet of there that was hand

2328
01:27:44,141 --> 01:27:49,141
raised,
my brother and I got a and like pet the 

2329
01:27:49,141 --> 01:27:49,141
fucking thing.
Right.

2330
01:27:49,141 --> 01:27:51,901
And just hearing that it sounds like it,
like a harley davidson right in person 

2331
01:27:51,901 --> 01:27:55,861
and you see this the first actually 
really course and they have a certain 

2332
01:27:55,861 --> 01:27:55,861
presence about them just like I don't 
fuck with me.

2333
01:27:55,861 --> 01:27:56,860
Right.
And I'm at that point I'm like,

2334
01:27:56,861 --> 01:27:58,120
okay,
I'll go and I'll get my photo op and I'm

2335
01:27:58,121 --> 01:28:03,121
gonna get the hell out because I don't 
want to have my face eat and like that 

2336
01:28:03,121 --> 01:28:03,121
bad in that lady a while ago.
right.

2337
01:28:03,121 --> 01:28:03,700
And then there was another one that's 
just pacing the cage,

2338
01:28:03,790 --> 01:28:06,100
the cage.
And when she saw my little niece,

2339
01:28:06,250 --> 01:28:11,250
she stopped immediately made eye contact
and my niece could sense that this 

2340
01:28:11,250 --> 01:28:14,551
creature like looked at her and want her
to eat her and just like completely 

2341
01:28:14,551 --> 01:28:14,551
brand behind my brother's legs.
Right.

2342
01:28:14,551 --> 01:28:15,550
Because the cheated just saw her as 
food.

2343
01:28:15,551 --> 01:28:20,551
Right.
It's just that primal instinct just 

2344
01:28:20,551 --> 01:28:20,551
kicked in.
Yeah.

2345
01:28:20,551 --> 01:28:20,551
They can't help it.
Cheetahs can be domesticated.

2346
01:28:20,551 --> 01:28:24,751
They're one of the few animals that,
that you can successfully domestIcate 

2347
01:28:24,751 --> 01:28:25,360
them or they're actually in the low end 
of the cat food chain in africa too,

2348
01:28:25,361 --> 01:28:25,570
right?

2349
01:28:25,570 --> 01:28:27,870
Is that what it is?
They're actually somewhat majored.

2350
01:28:28,040 --> 01:28:29,440
Yeah.
Yeah.

2351
01:28:29,500 --> 01:28:32,290
And people have actually kept them as 
pets and trained them and shit.

2352
01:28:32,320 --> 01:28:35,380
I guess they don't kill you dude.
I mean a few animals.

2353
01:28:35,560 --> 01:28:36,910
I'm still not going to trust it.
Right.

2354
01:28:36,911 --> 01:28:37,930
Yeah.
I was a smart move,

2355
01:28:37,931 --> 01:28:40,870
especially with your nice man.
So she wasn't allowed in with them.

2356
01:28:40,871 --> 01:28:41,440
Of course.
Right.

2357
01:28:41,610 --> 01:28:43,200
I mean even,
you know,

2358
01:28:43,450 --> 01:28:46,660
having it aware that that's food,
if you know it overseas or again,

2359
01:28:46,720 --> 01:28:51,720
it was funny to realize is it right?
And they didn't realize it was.

2360
01:28:52,240 --> 01:28:54,010
It was a magic moments are like,
all right,

2361
01:28:54,011 --> 01:28:55,110
this is something that.
Right.

2362
01:28:55,860 --> 01:28:56,100
That's

2363
01:28:56,100 --> 01:28:58,230
some scary shit dude.
Big cats of the scariest.

2364
01:28:58,260 --> 01:29:02,040
They say that the reason why we have 
scared where people afraid of monsters

2365
01:29:02,040 --> 01:29:07,040
like every kid is.
So I'll just leftover dna from monkeys 

2366
01:29:07,040 --> 01:29:07,800
getting jacked yet.
But cats back when we were,

2367
01:29:07,860 --> 01:29:09,290
you know,
subhuman,

2368
01:29:09,620 --> 01:29:12,000
hominoid parental instinct to avoid 
scary stuff,

2369
01:29:12,001 --> 01:29:12,480
man.
Right.

2370
01:29:12,481 --> 01:29:15,270
And like if there's an old Stephen King 
thing line,

2371
01:29:15,271 --> 01:29:17,370
I can't remember what it was from where 
he was saying,

2372
01:29:17,371 --> 01:29:22,371
you know,
the lightening crashes and the door 

2373
01:29:22,371 --> 01:29:23,811
opens and you see a 40 foot bug,
they are part of you is happy because 

2374
01:29:23,811 --> 01:29:23,850
you're expecting 60 foot bug.
Right?

2375
01:29:23,851 --> 01:29:25,290
Like thAt's why alien worked,
right?

2376
01:29:25,291 --> 01:29:30,291
Because you don't see the full alien 
right at the beginning you see the 

2377
01:29:30,291 --> 01:29:32,631
little bit of the leg,
a little bit of the tail and you're 

2378
01:29:32,631 --> 01:29:32,631
imagining like what could this thing 
possibly look like?

2379
01:29:32,631 --> 01:29:32,670
And yeah,
it was the most screwed up.

2380
01:29:32,700 --> 01:29:36,690
Awesome hr giger design like ever.
but at the same tIme in your head,

2381
01:29:36,691 --> 01:29:41,691
it was still out there.
We already watched aliens recently is 

2382
01:29:41,691 --> 01:29:42,930
good.
But the problem with aliens is that they

2383
01:29:42,931 --> 01:29:47,130
established an alien that this thing is 
super fucking intelligent,

2384
01:29:47,131 --> 01:29:49,170
really fast,
gigantic,

2385
01:29:49,260 --> 01:29:52,350
super resourceful,
very crafty and sneaky.

2386
01:29:52,470 --> 01:29:57,470
But then the second one,
they're just shooting them left and 

2387
01:29:57,470 --> 01:29:57,470
right.
And they're dying.

2388
01:29:57,870 --> 01:29:58,830
They needed one.
You know,

2389
01:29:58,831 --> 01:30:02,010
it was one daily versus the truckers to.
They went too quick.

2390
01:30:02,190 --> 01:30:04,710
They should have had less aliens.
Let's look who the fuck of mine.

2391
01:30:04,920 --> 01:30:09,920
Movie designer telling them one of the 
greatest science fiction movies of all 

2392
01:30:09,920 --> 01:30:09,920
time.
IT's still an amazing movie.

2393
01:30:09,920 --> 01:30:11,040
But to me I was like,
wait a minute.

2394
01:30:11,041 --> 01:30:13,770
You can just kill them that easy.
everyone's just running around shotgun.

2395
01:30:13,771 --> 01:30:17,250
I knew better than one.
One is an exercise in action.

2396
01:30:17,251 --> 01:30:18,900
One is an exercise in suspense,
right?

2397
01:30:19,050 --> 01:30:24,050
One is the tease of the leg.
The other ones the full on blown out 

2398
01:30:24,050 --> 01:30:24,050
porno,
right?

2399
01:30:24,050 --> 01:30:26,961
Yeah.
And if you ever watched a rewatch the 

2400
01:30:26,961 --> 01:30:26,961
things to shoot scenes in the second 
one,

2401
01:30:26,961 --> 01:30:29,060
like when she was battling it with the 
exoskeleton on,

2402
01:30:29,080 --> 01:30:34,080
I was like,
why isn't it just stabbing you in the 

2403
01:30:34,080 --> 01:30:35,661
heart?
It's got this giant fucking monster 

2404
01:30:35,661 --> 01:30:35,661
tale.

2405
01:30:35,661 --> 01:30:36,510
Why isn't it just scooping you out of 
your camera and sat down and he's like,

2406
01:30:36,580 --> 01:30:38,640
I want to see a fucking mac versus an 
alien.

2407
01:30:39,210 --> 01:30:40,980
there's a certain point in creativity,
man,

2408
01:30:40,981 --> 01:30:41,880
where you have to be like,
you know what?

2409
01:30:42,090 --> 01:30:44,910
A gun with a chainsaw.
It makes absolutely no sense on it.

2410
01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:46,830
Like even look at the design.
If you went to grab the gun,

2411
01:30:46,831 --> 01:30:48,060
you saw your finger off.
RighT?

2412
01:30:48,240 --> 01:30:49,940
But it's cool.
Yeah,

2413
01:30:49,950 --> 01:30:51,840
but what I'm talking about is cut the 
shit moments.

2414
01:30:51,841 --> 01:30:56,841
I'm the suspension of disbelief where 
you make me go in a place where I think 

2415
01:30:56,841 --> 01:30:57,510
you got lazy or you did.
So why are you making me go here?

2416
01:30:57,660 --> 01:30:59,160
Why?
Why is this your conclusion?

2417
01:30:59,161 --> 01:30:59,530
What?
How?

2418
01:30:59,580 --> 01:31:04,580
How's this bitch fight in the city?
All they had to do is build a certain 

2419
01:31:04,580 --> 01:31:05,040
amount of,
but they had make it believable.

2420
01:31:05,041 --> 01:31:06,300
You gotta you gotta,
you gotta.

2421
01:31:06,540 --> 01:31:11,540
I can't like have to go.
Oh well I guess it's just really bad 

2422
01:31:11,540 --> 01:31:15,381
with its tail today.
That's the same argument that says the 

2423
01:31:15,381 --> 01:31:15,381
lord of the rings.
why didn't they just grabbed those birds

2424
01:31:15,381 --> 01:31:18,630
at the end of it and have them fly over 
and drop the ring into the volcano?

2425
01:31:18,631 --> 01:31:19,770
Right.
Like there's always.

2426
01:31:19,800 --> 01:31:23,100
It's always possible to find words.
Don't listen to you fucking ryan.

2427
01:31:23,120 --> 01:31:24,300
The birds at the end of the movie,
man,

2428
01:31:26,020 --> 01:31:28,140
carrier pigeon trust birds,
birds,

2429
01:31:28,860 --> 01:31:31,560
birds are all former dinosaurs.
That became something new.

2430
01:31:31,561 --> 01:31:34,110
That's evil bird ever is the african 
grey,

2431
01:31:34,800 --> 01:31:36,540
the most evil bird you ever see a shoe 
bill.

2432
01:31:36,660 --> 01:31:41,660
Now there's a Congo documentary from the
bbc that freaked me out once because he 

2433
01:31:41,660 --> 01:31:45,781
was five foot tall,
prehistoric fucking bird with his giant 

2434
01:31:45,781 --> 01:31:46,500
bill.
That jacks these fish.

2435
01:31:46,820 --> 01:31:47,790
It's fascinating,
man.

2436
01:31:47,820 --> 01:31:50,040
The thing that fascinates me most about 
birds,

2437
01:31:50,200 --> 01:31:52,620
because they really are dinosaurs,
they really are.

2438
01:31:52,680 --> 01:31:53,430
You know,
they,

2439
01:31:53,950 --> 01:31:58,950
they think that a lot of.
There's a lot of theories that a lot of 

2440
01:31:58,950 --> 01:31:58,950
dinosaurs had feathers that,
you know,

2441
01:31:58,950 --> 01:32:00,040
they just wrote it off and then we don't
see

2442
01:32:00,040 --> 01:32:01,190
the fossils of feathers.
Yeah.

2443
01:32:01,200 --> 01:32:03,070
The fossils were just placed there to 
test our faith.

2444
01:32:03,100 --> 01:32:04,920
Dude.
Dude,

2445
01:32:04,970 --> 01:32:08,470
that I argue with on twitter all day.
I don't argue with them all day,

2446
01:32:08,710 --> 01:32:13,710
but I read his shit all day.
What is your threshold for blocking 

2447
01:32:13,710 --> 01:32:13,710
people?
Oh,

2448
01:32:13,710 --> 01:32:14,510
I just there if they're annoying.
I just.

2449
01:32:14,620 --> 01:32:16,030
I don't.
I just go on instinct.

2450
01:32:16,031 --> 01:32:17,280
If you're annoying me,
I just blocked it.

2451
01:32:17,320 --> 01:32:18,760
I love it when their dicks.
Yeah.

2452
01:32:18,761 --> 01:32:19,870
It's just so easy.
It's a little bit.

2453
01:32:19,990 --> 01:32:23,710
I read a thing for you.
Do you get a block block?

2454
01:32:23,770 --> 01:32:28,770
I always quote that old comedy,
but you did about the disproportionate 

2455
01:32:28,770 --> 01:32:29,260
amount of racial interracial porn being 
sold in the south.

2456
01:32:29,300 --> 01:32:30,520
Right?
It's like,

2457
01:32:30,521 --> 01:32:35,521
dude,
like if you hate me that obviously 

2458
01:32:35,521 --> 01:32:38,011
there's something that I fucked up with 
my team and the game that we did 

2459
01:32:38,011 --> 01:32:41,401
something wrong.
Like how can I flip this to turn you 

2460
01:32:41,401 --> 01:32:41,401
into somebody who likes what we do?
It's just one switch away.

2461
01:32:41,401 --> 01:32:42,910
Maybe it's a,
it's a reply saying,

2462
01:32:42,911 --> 01:32:43,570
hey man,
sorry.

2463
01:32:43,571 --> 01:32:48,571
The matchmaking sucked in gears too.
We've been working on fixing it like 

2464
01:32:48,571 --> 01:32:51,481
something like that to win you over and 
if you do then you could wind up with a 

2465
01:32:51,481 --> 01:32:51,481
fan for life.
Right?

2466
01:32:51,481 --> 01:32:51,481
You would have to go back and

2467
01:32:51,500 --> 01:32:56,500
time and stop that bus driver from 
fucking them in the ass and and roofie 

2468
01:32:56,511 --> 01:33:01,511
in them and given them moonshine.
You'd have to do that and maybe why 

2469
01:33:01,511 --> 01:33:06,281
they're angry,
whether mom didn't love them or maybe 

2470
01:33:06,281 --> 01:33:06,281
it's just.

2471
01:33:06,281 --> 01:33:06,281
Yeah,
it was it.

2472
01:33:06,281 --> 01:33:09,570
The 36 inch lcd testicles that the 
internet provides people,

2473
01:33:09,571 --> 01:33:10,770
right?
Once you have an amenity,

2474
01:33:10,771 --> 01:33:11,970
suddenly they get giant ball,

2475
01:33:11,990 --> 01:33:12,820
right?
There's that,

2476
01:33:12,821 --> 01:33:15,450
but why are they angry at something?
You know?

2477
01:33:15,500 --> 01:33:16,660
Don't take a healthy,
happy,

2478
01:33:16,661 --> 01:33:20,060
super cool person who watches a game.
it doesn't really like it.

2479
01:33:20,090 --> 01:33:22,000
It goes into tax you on a personal 
basis.

2480
01:33:22,170 --> 01:33:27,170
There's,
they're coming from a deep anger of 

2481
01:33:27,170 --> 01:33:27,170
depression,
peps.

2482
01:33:27,170 --> 01:33:27,170
It's,
it's a lot of different things,

2483
01:33:27,170 --> 01:33:28,660
man.
It's your life not being what you wanted

2484
01:33:28,661 --> 01:33:33,661
it to be.
Unfilled expectations were all around 

2485
01:33:33,661 --> 01:33:33,661
you.
There's people like paris,

2486
01:33:33,661 --> 01:33:38,191
hilton and kim kardashians that are 
multimillionaires driving around a 

2487
01:33:38,191 --> 01:33:42,601
bentleys and they do nothing,
and your dry going crazy and so you 

2488
01:33:42,601 --> 01:33:43,170
attack and so you lose your game is for 
faggots.

2489
01:33:43,171 --> 01:33:45,370
You Read shit.
I hope you die in a fire.

2490
01:33:45,520 --> 01:33:45,910
You know,
like,

2491
01:33:45,930 --> 01:33:46,250
whoa,

2492
01:33:47,170 --> 01:33:49,060
we're in the era of the art of the bed 
celebrity man.

2493
01:33:49,061 --> 01:33:50,620
You don't have to be famous for 
anything.

2494
01:33:50,621 --> 01:33:52,690
You could just be famous for being 
famous.

2495
01:33:52,990 --> 01:33:54,450
You know what it isn't.
So it wasn't angelina,

2496
01:33:54,460 --> 01:33:55,940
the blonde.
He always used to have billboards.

2497
01:33:56,090 --> 01:33:56,790
Yeah,
I'm going to pee,

2498
01:33:56,791 --> 01:33:58,420
but go into.
It's the continuation of that,

2499
01:33:58,421 --> 01:33:58,990
right?
I mean,

2500
01:33:58,991 --> 01:33:59,770
it's just like,
oh,

2501
01:33:59,771 --> 01:34:01,450
you know,
you just want to be famous.

2502
01:34:01,451 --> 01:34:04,300
So you are right.
It amazes me right now.

2503
01:34:04,430 --> 01:34:09,430
How many celebrities can bounce back 
from like doing anything right now 

2504
01:34:09,430 --> 01:34:10,210
because America just loves a comeback 
story,

2505
01:34:10,211 --> 01:34:12,070
right?
You look at like charlie sheen,

2506
01:34:12,100 --> 01:34:17,100
remember everyone forgets.
Kim kardashians had a hardcore sex tape 

2507
01:34:17,100 --> 01:34:17,100
out there.
You're like,

2508
01:34:17,100 --> 01:34:17,100
dude,
really?

2509
01:34:17,100 --> 01:34:19,630
Like in their little girls out there 
that are looking up to her right now.

2510
01:34:19,780 --> 01:34:21,310
I had a buddy of mine recently who,
uh,

2511
01:34:21,610 --> 01:34:26,610
actually finally,
I'm sure this happens in la all the 

2512
01:34:26,610 --> 01:34:28,801
time,
but he found it ex-girlfriend actually 

2513
01:34:28,801 --> 01:34:28,801
in a random porn video online.

2514
01:34:28,801 --> 01:34:29,050
No way.
It's got to be.

2515
01:34:29,410 --> 01:34:34,410
I want it to happen one day.
I want to be able to just go sell my 

2516
01:34:34,410 --> 01:34:34,410
feelings.
Right.

2517
01:34:34,410 --> 01:34:35,170
And it's,
it's one of those things like if you sit

2518
01:34:35,171 --> 01:34:36,030
there,
like I say,

2519
01:34:36,031 --> 01:34:37,990
like porn is like on the internet,
it's like a,

2520
01:34:38,170 --> 01:34:43,170
a mandelbrot fractal.
he just keeps going and going and you 

2521
01:34:43,170 --> 01:34:43,170
could just keep the.
And it's never ending.

2522
01:34:43,170 --> 01:34:47,731
Like when we were growing up it was like
asia carrera and like a ginger lynn and 

2523
01:34:48,311 --> 01:34:53,311
then like jamison and then janet and I 
was like the same 15 actors just 

2524
01:34:53,311 --> 01:34:54,340
repeated with different spoofs of 
movies.

2525
01:34:54,341 --> 01:34:59,341
Right now it's like you can just go on 
there and it's like an amount of girls 

2526
01:34:59,341 --> 01:34:59,341
and you're like,
at what point are you like,

2527
01:34:59,341 --> 01:35:00,650
all right,
so this is a thousand dollars.

2528
01:35:00,890 --> 01:35:02,480
I don't think anybody's ever going to 
see this.

2529
01:35:02,481 --> 01:35:03,860
And his reaction,
man,

2530
01:35:03,861 --> 01:35:04,730
it felt so bad for him.

2531
01:35:04,730 --> 01:35:06,410
And of course I teased them like 
nobody's business,

2532
01:35:06,411 --> 01:35:07,040
but I was like,
dude,

2533
01:35:07,041 --> 01:35:09,980
you're getting your,
like you're chasing amy type of a,

2534
01:35:10,270 --> 01:35:12,500
a girl next door type moment.
Right?

2535
01:35:12,501 --> 01:35:14,960
Like if he was just kind of crestfallen 
about it,

2536
01:35:14,961 --> 01:35:16,220
they didn't even go out that long.
right.

2537
01:35:16,400 --> 01:35:17,180
But the fact that,
you know,

2538
01:35:17,181 --> 01:35:20,360
at some point he found this girl cool 
thing hung out and then he finds a video

2539
01:35:20,361 --> 01:35:25,361
over on some random internet site doing 
some bad cheerleader porn and it was 

2540
01:35:25,361 --> 01:35:25,460
just like,
just coming back,

2541
01:35:25,461 --> 01:35:30,461
who is this?
You're talking to a buddy of mine in 

2542
01:35:30,461 --> 01:35:30,461
town.
You see peopLe in a,

2543
01:35:30,461 --> 01:35:31,040
in la,
I'm sure it's a common thing to like,

2544
01:35:31,041 --> 01:35:31,750
you know,
data girl,

2545
01:35:31,780 --> 01:35:34,220
then find out later she's a porn girl 
where she's done stuff like that,

2546
01:35:34,221 --> 01:35:35,570
but you don't see it that often.
And,

2547
01:35:35,571 --> 01:35:36,650
and,
and outside of that.

2548
01:35:36,651 --> 01:35:41,651
And I had a friend of mine recently 
happened to and imagining the mix of 

2549
01:35:41,651 --> 01:35:41,651
feelings.

2550
01:35:41,651 --> 01:35:43,250
He came like,
like of comedy of crestfallen.

2551
01:35:43,260 --> 01:35:43,640
I'm like,
I'm,

2552
01:35:43,800 --> 01:35:44,260
I'm like,
dude,

2553
01:35:44,290 --> 01:35:44,790
did you,
did you,

2554
01:35:44,840 --> 01:35:46,400
did you,
did you rub one out to it?

2555
01:35:46,490 --> 01:35:47,720
And he wouldn't,
he wouldn't admit to it,

2556
01:35:48,440 --> 01:35:53,440
but the feeling he would have of the 
lottery just saying to brian about the 

2557
01:35:53,440 --> 01:35:54,830
chasing amy slash girl next door type 
vibe.

2558
01:35:54,831 --> 01:35:55,760
Right?
Or just like,

2559
01:35:55,790 --> 01:35:58,550
oh man,
it's kinda funny.

2560
01:35:58,910 --> 01:36:00,040
I blame joe frances.
Hey,

2561
01:36:00,070 --> 01:36:02,030
what's going on with the gears of war 
movie?

2562
01:36:02,380 --> 01:36:05,050
They're stiLl making that you guys still
make for the sirens.

2563
01:36:05,070 --> 01:36:06,590
Goodbye.
I'm optimist.

2564
01:36:06,620 --> 01:36:11,620
Still working on it.
I learned a lot about how a filmmaking 

2565
01:36:11,620 --> 01:36:12,110
and how hollywood never end the business
works,

2566
01:36:12,111 --> 01:36:12,710
right?
I mean,

2567
01:36:12,740 --> 01:36:14,450
you really realized that it is very much

2568
01:36:14,480 --> 01:36:16,220
business.
It's annoying as fuck,

2569
01:36:16,221 --> 01:36:21,221
right?
There's so many people with so many 

2570
01:36:21,221 --> 01:36:21,221
different opinions and you gotta listen 
to all of them.

2571
01:36:21,221 --> 01:36:21,221
Well,
and it's,

2572
01:36:21,221 --> 01:36:21,650
it's,
there are people who just don't mind,

2573
01:36:21,700 --> 01:36:23,880
don't even have an opinion,
but in order to stay relevant they throw

2574
01:36:23,910 --> 01:36:24,760
their near here.

2575
01:36:24,830 --> 01:36:28,820
I'm only hearing that on one side,
one side to see test,

2576
01:36:28,821 --> 01:36:29,480
test.
Oh,

2577
01:36:29,820 --> 01:36:31,400
you know what?
I think it reconnected.

2578
01:36:31,940 --> 01:36:33,490
I think it's just the base.
Sorry.

2579
01:36:34,010 --> 01:36:34,640
So,
um,

2580
01:36:34,860 --> 01:36:37,740
what happens is it's a business like any
other business,

2581
01:36:37,741 --> 01:36:42,741
right?
And people want to make money and often 

2582
01:36:42,741 --> 01:36:43,050
the people who make the decisions are 
often very rear with looking like,

2583
01:36:43,051 --> 01:36:48,051
well,
I'm looking at the last two years and 

2584
01:36:48,051 --> 01:36:48,051
according to this,
movies with monkeys and them do well.

2585
01:36:48,051 --> 01:36:53,001
So you need a monkey.
And I'm not saying that's my personal 

2586
01:36:53,001 --> 01:36:53,001
experience.
Exactly what it is.

2587
01:36:53,001 --> 01:36:53,001
Yeah.
I'm not sure this project,

2588
01:36:53,001 --> 01:36:54,240
but what happened was they had a.
They were like,

2589
01:36:54,241 --> 01:36:55,170
okay,
why don't do this big,

2590
01:36:55,200 --> 01:36:55,740
you know,
he got,

2591
01:36:56,010 --> 01:36:57,410
you know,
len wiseman attached.

2592
01:36:57,440 --> 01:36:59,640
He great guy,
amazing director.

2593
01:37:00,030 --> 01:37:00,780
Okay,
well great.

2594
01:37:00,781 --> 01:37:02,100
Well you know,
we have a really good script.

2595
01:37:02,101 --> 01:37:03,330
You know,
we think we can knock this out.

2596
01:37:03,630 --> 01:37:06,560
They looked at the budget like okay,
so this is $120,000,000

2597
01:37:06,600 --> 01:37:09,360
estimated and there's no real love story
in here.

2598
01:37:09,420 --> 01:37:11,140
It's got it.
It's got to be rated r because the,

2599
01:37:11,160 --> 01:37:16,160
you know,
if I show up at comicon and we have a 

2600
01:37:16,160 --> 01:37:16,260
clip that doesn't have people getting 
cut in half and blood flying everywhere,

2601
01:37:16,290 --> 01:37:21,290
they're going to tear us limb from limb 
and then there is no little kid jayden 

2602
01:37:21,290 --> 01:37:26,061
smith type story and they're like,
this just doesn't add up like the 

2603
01:37:26,061 --> 01:37:26,061
assistant head.

2604
01:37:26,061 --> 01:37:29,450
All the demographics.
And I remember reading a storY about 

2605
01:37:29,450 --> 01:37:31,821
these guys who kind of created a 
computer formula for it where you can 

2606
01:37:31,821 --> 01:37:31,950
literally plug in the genre.
You could plug in the actors.

2607
01:37:31,951 --> 01:37:33,100
You flipped the time of year it,
russell,

2608
01:37:33,120 --> 01:37:34,950
release the various themes that are in 
it and they could,

2609
01:37:35,790 --> 01:37:37,710
you know,
vegas type betting odds,

2610
01:37:37,711 --> 01:37:40,290
you could bet on whether or not their 
production would actually make money and

2611
01:37:40,291 --> 01:37:41,610
they,
they make money doing this.

2612
01:37:41,640 --> 01:37:46,640
Right.
And you're at the point where I'm 

2613
01:37:46,640 --> 01:37:46,640
sleeping,
right?

2614
01:37:46,640 --> 01:37:46,640
Yeah.
And it's,

2615
01:37:46,640 --> 01:37:46,640
it's.
And they're saying,

2616
01:37:46,640 --> 01:37:47,340
well we won't get the matrix that we 
will get the 300 out of it,

2617
01:37:47,341 --> 01:37:52,341
but we'll get some sort of will ferrell 
comedy that where he's got to where 

2618
01:37:52,341 --> 01:37:52,980
you're doing a wacky sport,
right?

2619
01:37:52,981 --> 01:37:54,960
And you get to the point where 
creativity,

2620
01:37:55,320 --> 01:37:56,460
it goes to die in that environment

2621
01:37:56,460 --> 01:37:57,550
and for,
you know,

2622
01:37:57,660 --> 01:37:59,220
now everybody wants to make a district 
nine,

2623
01:37:59,290 --> 01:38:00,690
right?
Than like how can we make something that

2624
01:38:00,691 --> 01:38:02,430
only costs 60,
$60,000,000

2625
01:38:02,431 --> 01:38:07,431
and then blows it out because 
everybody's conscious about how much 

2626
01:38:07,431 --> 01:38:07,431
money they spend.
Basic economics,

2627
01:38:07,431 --> 01:38:07,431
right?
So,

2628
01:38:07,431 --> 01:38:11,631
I mean,
we're kinda redoubling of doing 

2629
01:38:11,631 --> 01:38:11,631
something that's a little bit smaller,
you know,

2630
01:38:11,631 --> 01:38:11,850
recycling the script projects.
Not dead man,

2631
01:38:11,851 --> 01:38:12,480
but uh,
you know,

2632
01:38:12,800 --> 01:38:16,170
doing it with live people a tbd bad.
I mean,

2633
01:38:16,171 --> 01:38:18,020
a lot of it depends on who gets attached
as a director,

2634
01:38:18,030 --> 01:38:18,870
things like that.
I mean,

2635
01:38:18,871 --> 01:38:22,860
I personally would like to see live 
action as little cg as possible.

2636
01:38:22,980 --> 01:38:24,570
I would like cgi people.
Man.

2637
01:38:24,810 --> 01:38:26,910
You know why your people don't look 
real.

2638
01:38:27,090 --> 01:38:28,770
These motherfuckers,
they're giant heads.

2639
01:38:28,771 --> 01:38:30,750
What are going to get brock lesnar to 
play every role?

2640
01:38:30,780 --> 01:38:34,640
dude and dudes look like fake dude.
There's not a lot.

2641
01:38:34,800 --> 01:38:37,700
Not a lot of thick neck guys like that 
that have that level of charisma to hold

2642
01:38:37,701 --> 01:38:39,450
up on over there.
A two going to work.

2643
01:38:39,451 --> 01:38:42,870
You gotta go cgi son that he gets some 
little voices.

2644
01:38:42,871 --> 01:38:47,871
Yeah,
geek dudes who are crazy like they're 

2645
01:38:47,871 --> 01:38:49,270
getting closer with that,
but duty they carried.

2646
01:38:49,280 --> 01:38:51,540
The guys don't have to be that jack dude
like,

2647
01:38:51,541 --> 01:38:53,730
but your guys are so jacked and gears of
war.

2648
01:38:53,731 --> 01:38:58,731
Everyone's jack.
That's part of the cool thing aBout 

2649
01:38:58,731 --> 01:39:00,680
dIesel to your average person in pitch 
black looks jacked and he's five foot 

2650
01:39:00,680 --> 01:39:02,810
two and was maybe what like five to.
He's a lot bigger than that.

2651
01:39:03,240 --> 01:39:04,410
When I've seen him,
he was short maybe.

2652
01:39:04,411 --> 01:39:09,411
I think he's six feet tall.
He's friends with rigo rodriguez who 

2653
01:39:09,411 --> 01:39:13,900
used to be ufc heavyweight champion.
I met a metal maybe in a bad angle,

2654
01:39:13,910 --> 01:39:15,180
way bigger than seems short.

2655
01:39:15,180 --> 01:39:15,930
When I saw a man,
well,

2656
01:39:15,960 --> 01:39:17,460
I'm short,
but he's bigger than me,

2657
01:39:17,640 --> 01:39:18,670
but the bottom line is,
dude,

2658
01:39:18,690 --> 01:39:20,250
it's more about charisma then is about 
muscles.

2659
01:39:20,251 --> 01:39:25,251
You get sliced charismatic.
Look at the hawk that you can't have a 

2660
01:39:25,251 --> 01:39:29,010
lou ferrigno doing the hulk in 2010.
We want that big fucking crazy cgi.

2661
01:39:30,340 --> 01:39:33,140
Crazy hog that fucking smashes down.
There's a huge.

2662
01:39:33,340 --> 01:39:35,670
There's a huge delta between markets.
Phoenix at the hulk.

2663
01:39:35,700 --> 01:39:40,700
His fists are his biggest pickup.
How head is this big compared to his 

2664
01:39:40,700 --> 01:39:40,830
body?
Marcus phoenix is jack,

2665
01:39:40,831 --> 01:39:43,280
but he's not like insanely jack.
He's not even as jackson guy.

2666
01:39:43,330 --> 01:39:44,820
The cubs were muscle and fitness 
magazine.

2667
01:39:44,821 --> 01:39:45,600
Yeah,
he is.

2668
01:39:45,660 --> 01:39:49,350
He's just as jacked and his head's extra
super wide because he's a double alpha.

2669
01:39:49,380 --> 01:39:50,910
The armors part part of it,
dude,

2670
01:39:51,030 --> 01:39:53,790
but it's fucking head is giant.
These perfect dude.

2671
01:39:53,950 --> 01:39:55,710
I fuck around man.
Listen,

2672
01:39:55,711 --> 01:39:58,890
dude,
get some super duper fucking cgi peps on

2673
01:39:58,891 --> 01:39:59,400
this shit.

2674
01:39:59,790 --> 01:40:01,170
Why?
You can do anything man.

2675
01:40:01,350 --> 01:40:02,880
Monsters and everything.
It all exists.

2676
01:40:02,881 --> 01:40:05,160
You can save a world.
That's insane.

2677
01:40:05,440 --> 01:40:07,710
Do that for 60 million,
but was it too expensive,

2678
01:40:07,740 --> 01:40:08,940
dude?
Do you know much avatar cost?

2679
01:40:09,080 --> 01:40:13,020
I mean it was insane how much they cost 
200 million plus trod cost.

2680
01:40:13,021 --> 01:40:15,630
One hundred 50 million.
Here's a better idea that you're in game

2681
01:40:15,631 --> 01:40:16,840
footage.
Movies like in,

2682
01:40:16,841 --> 01:40:21,841
in your video game are so good.
You should have like sItcoms with those 

2683
01:40:21,841 --> 01:40:21,940
guys going home after work,
like having a,

2684
01:40:22,080 --> 01:40:25,530
having a relationship with the fucking 
king and queens,

2685
01:40:26,490 --> 01:40:28,450
queens.
We're just get some dads home.

2686
01:40:28,470 --> 01:40:31,290
It takes 20 minutes,
take off his armor of god,

2687
01:40:31,360 --> 01:40:36,360
do it in game footage and stuff.
I've got like a sitcom with all your 

2688
01:40:36,360 --> 01:40:36,360
characters in it and they're all like 
family guy style.

2689
01:40:36,361 --> 01:40:37,920
They're all friends and they hang out 
and get drunk.

2690
01:40:37,960 --> 01:40:40,590
It was a terrible movie,
but it was a game,

2691
01:40:40,630 --> 01:40:42,510
right?
It's a terrible movie.

2692
01:40:42,511 --> 01:40:44,880
But it was an interesting concept.
There was a Bruce Willis movie.

2693
01:40:45,150 --> 01:40:46,280
Uh,
we're uh,

2694
01:40:46,650 --> 01:40:49,000
I think it was called surrogate 
surrogate's.

2695
01:40:49,070 --> 01:40:50,100
Yeah.
It was really recent.

2696
01:40:50,101 --> 01:40:51,230
Yeah.
Where everybody wide uptake.

2697
01:40:51,260 --> 01:40:51,640
They,
they,

2698
01:40:51,710 --> 01:40:53,920
they stayed at home and then they had 
the younger version of that all exist in

2699
01:40:53,921 --> 01:40:53,980
the

2700
01:40:53,980 --> 01:40:55,820
world.
The younger perfect version,

2701
01:40:55,830 --> 01:40:57,790
you have this full head of hair and 
perfect skin.

2702
01:40:57,791 --> 01:40:58,720
It was like kind of weird.
I don't know.

2703
01:40:58,870 --> 01:41:00,810
Cgi had him somehow,
but uh,

2704
01:41:00,860 --> 01:41:05,860
you're getting at the point where they 
can Kind of track your body and then 

2705
01:41:05,860 --> 01:41:05,890
kind of cgi over in such an amazing way.
Right.

2706
01:41:05,891 --> 01:41:10,891
And I mean,
you look at what they're there for tron 

2707
01:41:10,891 --> 01:41:11,350
that are recreated.
Kind of like jeff was saYing,

2708
01:41:11,351 --> 01:41:12,580
it looks a little bit more like gary 
oldman.

2709
01:41:12,581 --> 01:41:14,890
Then Jeff Bridges.
Yeah.

2710
01:41:15,240 --> 01:41:17,180
There's look at all the posters for 
that.

2711
01:41:17,370 --> 01:41:20,050
I'm dying to see the film and I think 
Jeff Bridges to me,

2712
01:41:20,051 --> 01:41:25,051
I thought it was pretty cool.
Jeff bridges gets cooler looking the 

2713
01:41:25,051 --> 01:41:27,931
older he gets.
Have you seen the trailer for trigger 

2714
01:41:27,931 --> 01:41:27,931
it?
Seen him naked.

2715
01:41:27,931 --> 01:41:28,310
It looks awesome.

2716
01:41:30,700 --> 01:41:35,700
Talking about his face that he looks so 
just drizzled,

2717
01:41:35,950 --> 01:41:37,720
right?
He just loses it.

2718
01:41:37,750 --> 01:41:41,320
Doesn't know where the fuck.
Think sagging and it was just bleed.

2719
01:41:41,600 --> 01:41:45,960
It's got skin tags breaking left and 
right and he's got,

2720
01:41:46,150 --> 01:41:47,410
you see the trailer for true grit 
though.

2721
01:41:47,480 --> 01:41:49,860
Yes.
I crazy heart too.

2722
01:41:50,360 --> 01:41:51,010
That was good.
yeah.

2723
01:41:51,011 --> 01:41:53,120
That was an interesting movie man.
It was kind of cool.

2724
01:41:53,150 --> 01:41:54,370
I like sad.
Right.

2725
01:41:54,371 --> 01:41:59,371
But dude was sad but it was good.
I mean it was The life lesson of being 

2726
01:41:59,371 --> 01:41:59,710
on the road that much.
Right.

2727
01:41:59,711 --> 01:42:00,510
In the loneliness.
Right.

2728
01:42:00,630 --> 01:42:02,410
It's also the party in men,
you know,

2729
01:42:02,550 --> 01:42:07,550
I've,
I've met a million people that have 

2730
01:42:07,550 --> 01:42:07,960
problems with partying,
with alcohol especially,

2731
01:42:07,961 --> 01:42:09,580
but with coke and with a bunch of 
different things,

2732
01:42:09,620 --> 01:42:14,620
they just,
people that are performers are 

2733
01:42:14,620 --> 01:42:15,340
performing all the time and they need to
get up to perform and that's the respect

2734
01:42:15,341 --> 01:42:15,580
I have.

2735
01:42:15,580 --> 01:42:16,150
Like I've,
I've,

2736
01:42:16,330 --> 01:42:21,330
I've done like the european press tour 
for the games where it's five european 

2737
01:42:21,330 --> 01:42:21,330
cities in five days and that just wrecks
me.

2738
01:42:21,330 --> 01:42:23,410
Right.
I cannot imagine doing like 30 cities in

2739
01:42:23,411 --> 01:42:24,280
40 days.
Right.

2740
01:42:24,281 --> 01:42:29,281
Like what it takes to actually pull that
off and to sit there and to show up 

2741
01:42:29,281 --> 01:42:29,281
every night and to command a stadium.
Like what does that,

2742
01:42:29,281 --> 01:42:30,040
what does that do to you?
Right?

2743
01:42:30,041 --> 01:42:31,300
Like how can you actually show up like 
that?

2744
01:42:31,301 --> 01:42:36,301
Right.
And then at the end of every night 

2745
01:42:36,301 --> 01:42:38,130
there's an infinite amount of partying 
or just the girls lined up to just do 

2746
01:42:38,130 --> 01:42:38,130
whatever.
Right?

2747
01:42:38,130 --> 01:42:39,170
Like at different city and new people 
experience,

2748
01:42:39,171 --> 01:42:44,171
you all think you're gone.
You really have to get Back to your 

2749
01:42:44,171 --> 01:42:46,321
hotel because you got to get up in the 
morning and five hours ago to your 

2750
01:42:46,321 --> 01:42:46,321
flight.
That's,

2751
01:42:46,321 --> 01:42:46,560
those are the ones who are responsible,
right?

2752
01:42:46,810 --> 01:42:47,810
Yeah.
Well it's all the.

2753
01:42:48,030 --> 01:42:49,410
The reality is those,
uh,

2754
01:42:49,420 --> 01:42:54,420
those tour,
like I only did one tour like that most 

2755
01:42:54,420 --> 01:42:56,671
of the time what I do with comedy as I 
go out on the weekends and then I come 

2756
01:42:56,671 --> 01:42:59,701
home,
I go out and go out for a couple of 

2757
01:42:59,701 --> 01:42:59,701
days,
then I come home.

2758
01:42:59,701 --> 01:43:00,070
But a lot of guys will go out and 
they'll do like,

2759
01:43:00,090 --> 01:43:05,090
you know,
like I know why mazda brawny we're 

2760
01:43:05,090 --> 01:43:05,290
talking about and he goes out and he 
goes out for like a couple of weeks,

2761
01:43:05,440 --> 01:43:06,130
three,
four weeks.

2762
01:43:06,430 --> 01:43:09,700
But one time we did this maximum tour 
and we were gone for like a month.

2763
01:43:09,720 --> 01:43:14,720
Yeah,
like a whole month of just constantly 

2764
01:43:14,720 --> 01:43:14,720
doing gigs and it's a fucking weird 
thing,

2765
01:43:14,720 --> 01:43:16,630
man.
It's not how many cities?

2766
01:43:16,980 --> 01:43:21,980
I think we did 22 to 22 and three days.
Do you have like a comedy bus or both?

2767
01:43:22,840 --> 01:43:26,020
We took a bus some places.
Most of the time we flew,

2768
01:43:26,290 --> 01:43:28,240
but it was a.
It was a brutal man.

2769
01:43:28,490 --> 01:43:29,570
Weird.
Everyday.

2770
01:43:29,630 --> 01:43:34,630
What'd you.
All you're doing is Traveling and then 

2771
01:43:34,630 --> 01:43:36,991
trying to get as much rest as possible 
and getting onstage and then trying to 

2772
01:43:36,991 --> 01:43:37,000
get as much rest as possible.
And traveling.

2773
01:43:37,001 --> 01:43:39,220
You never get a full night's sleep.
You're always flying.

2774
01:43:39,221 --> 01:43:41,440
You're always eating terrible food.
It's interesting.

2775
01:43:41,470 --> 01:43:43,360
Even though it was fun.
Your comedy gets tight.

2776
01:43:43,361 --> 01:43:45,310
She loved awake.
Did she left the waking up and going?

2777
01:43:45,311 --> 01:43:46,660
Where the fuck am I?
All the time.

2778
01:43:46,750 --> 01:43:47,800
Yeah.
I still did that.

2779
01:43:48,070 --> 01:43:50,170
I do that so often because I travel so 
much.

2780
01:43:50,180 --> 01:43:50,380
Like,
oh,

2781
01:43:50,390 --> 01:43:51,530
get up to pee and I'll go,
okay,

2782
01:43:51,531 --> 01:43:53,600
where's this bathroom?
Where do you know my trick?

2783
01:43:53,660 --> 01:43:55,100
Leave the bathroom light on,
close the door.

2784
01:43:55,400 --> 01:43:55,780
Oh,
that's a good.

2785
01:43:55,850 --> 01:43:57,350
Because when you don't know where the 
hell you are and your,

2786
01:43:57,360 --> 01:43:58,070
your,
your hey,

2787
01:43:58,071 --> 01:43:58,950
you got to go like you.

2788
01:43:59,030 --> 01:44:04,030
That thing will be like this.
God you motherfucker,

2789
01:44:04,311 --> 01:44:09,311
you.
But I've had that happen and there's a 

2790
01:44:09,311 --> 01:44:09,311
worse feeling in the world.
you want to.

2791
01:44:09,311 --> 01:44:09,311
Weird thing,
man.

2792
01:44:09,350 --> 01:44:10,960
It's a hotel room.
You just pee on the floor.

2793
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:16,000
And joe had like a scare at a hotel 
where we both thought we were going to 

2794
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:19,121
die and we've talked about it before,
but that really changed the whole thing 

2795
01:44:19,121 --> 01:44:19,121
for hotels.
For me,

2796
01:44:19,121 --> 01:44:22,320
I actually fear hotel to hotel rooms.
We'll check.

2797
01:44:22,440 --> 01:44:24,890
I'll always look out the like somebody 
knocks at the door,

2798
01:44:24,891 --> 01:44:27,670
always look out the little law.
The people and fire.

2799
01:44:27,820 --> 01:44:29,140
Yeah,
wasn't it?

2800
01:44:29,270 --> 01:44:31,580
You know what the problem was?
It was in an old hotel.

2801
01:44:31,700 --> 01:44:33,320
It wouldn't have been nearly as much of 
a problem,

2802
01:44:33,321 --> 01:44:36,340
but there was a single file staircase 
and we were on the fifth.

2803
01:44:36,360 --> 01:44:37,580
I was on the 15th.
What floor were you on?

2804
01:44:37,600 --> 01:44:39,640
I was on the 14th I think.
And um,

2805
01:44:39,740 --> 01:44:42,560
you know,
and you could only get one person on the

2806
01:44:42,561 --> 01:44:45,230
staircase at the time and people were 
slow as fuck.

2807
01:44:45,660 --> 01:44:50,660
You feel that you have,
you probably felt that like people are 

2808
01:44:50,660 --> 01:44:50,660
about to trample each other like at that
threshold,

2809
01:44:50,660 --> 01:44:55,181
right?
Where there's just that instinct kicks 

2810
01:44:55,181 --> 01:44:55,181
in.
I was like,

2811
01:44:55,181 --> 01:44:55,181
that kiddIng.
I'm the head of the pack.

2812
01:44:55,181 --> 01:44:55,181
I was the one who will be running on 
people's heads.

2813
01:44:55,360 --> 01:45:00,360
I was seconds away from sprinting 
through these fucking people with 

2814
01:45:00,360 --> 01:45:00,360
slippers on,
man.

2815
01:45:00,360 --> 01:45:05,171
All ambient.
You can tell they were fucked up from 

2816
01:45:05,171 --> 01:45:05,390
sleeping pills and shit.
And they were moving slow as shit.

2817
01:45:05,560 --> 01:45:10,560
And the problem is the announcement like
the lady on the things like please 

2818
01:45:10,560 --> 01:45:11,660
evacuate a building.
The building of fire has been detected.

2819
01:45:11,780 --> 01:45:13,430
Please evacuate the building 
immediately.

2820
01:45:13,431 --> 01:45:14,140
And what time did that happen?

2821
01:45:14,140 --> 01:45:15,440
Like three in the morning,
4:30,

2822
01:45:15,470 --> 01:45:20,470
4:30.
and especially not knowing where the 

2823
01:45:20,470 --> 01:45:20,470
hell you are.
You know,

2824
01:45:20,470 --> 01:45:21,480
it's like a robot voice that woke us up 
at dan chen.

2825
01:45:22,160 --> 01:45:24,470
But it wasn't,
it was a woman.

2826
01:45:24,490 --> 01:45:28,370
There was a woman talking because while 
she was talking she was doing it.

2827
01:45:28,371 --> 01:45:29,960
so robotic,
we were trying to,

2828
01:45:30,030 --> 01:45:30,770
it was,
first of all,

2829
01:45:30,771 --> 01:45:33,140
we're so foggy and we're trying to 
figure out why,

2830
01:45:33,200 --> 01:45:33,710
why,
you know,

2831
01:45:33,711 --> 01:45:38,711
if this is really happening,
it doesn't seem like how you would tell 

2832
01:45:38,711 --> 01:45:39,560
me that the fucking buildings on fire.
Exactly.

2833
01:45:39,740 --> 01:45:40,370
So this,
this,

2834
01:45:40,840 --> 01:45:42,860
uh,
fire has been detected in the building.

2835
01:45:43,010 --> 01:45:47,210
Please evacuate immediately and I'm not 
sure if this portal,

2836
01:45:47,270 --> 01:45:52,270
I don't know if it's a robot or if it's 
a real perSon at the building until I 

2837
01:45:52,270 --> 01:45:54,440
hear in the background,
we got to get these people outta here.

2838
01:45:54,500 --> 01:45:59,500
Shut them.
There was a guy in the back behind her 

2839
01:45:59,500 --> 01:45:59,500
that must,
must've been like,

2840
01:45:59,500 --> 01:45:59,500
you know,
behind the counter with her.

2841
01:45:59,500 --> 01:46:04,030
It's like we gotta get these people out 
of here and then it was just a false 

2842
01:46:04,030 --> 01:46:04,790
alarm and he's just decided to fuck with
everybody.

2843
01:46:04,791 --> 01:46:05,230
Like,
no,

2844
01:46:05,231 --> 01:46:05,500
no,
no,

2845
01:46:05,690 --> 01:46:07,400
it's on the twelfth floor now we need to
get him out.

2846
01:46:07,520 --> 01:46:12,520
I remember thinking that I was the same 
exact thing as joke because we had 

2847
01:46:12,520 --> 01:46:13,100
talked about it afterwards and I was 
thinking the same thing.

2848
01:46:13,101 --> 01:46:16,580
Like I am going to have to start 
throwing people out of my way.

2849
01:46:17,060 --> 01:46:21,540
And then I looked at the windows like in
the stairways that was like off the,

2850
01:46:21,730 --> 01:46:26,730
it just,
it's just amazing how slow people can 

2851
01:46:26,730 --> 01:46:26,730
actually physically move.
Like,

2852
01:46:26,730 --> 01:46:27,770
like that plane that landed on the 
hudson a couple of years ago.

2853
01:46:27,771 --> 01:46:30,100
Like I would've just crapped my pants.
I'm like,

2854
01:46:30,110 --> 01:46:31,020
get me off of thiS.
Right?

2855
01:46:31,030 --> 01:46:33,800
So how many people do,
are barely taking care of their body?

2856
01:46:34,040 --> 01:46:36,170
Barely.
Barely,

2857
01:46:36,200 --> 01:46:37,670
barely.
Next to that guy on the plane.

2858
01:46:37,680 --> 01:46:40,190
It gives you the extra elbow rest.
Yeah.

2859
01:46:40,400 --> 01:46:45,400
When it's leaking over under your seat.
And we were thinking about that when we 

2860
01:46:45,400 --> 01:46:45,530
were,
we had ralphie on the podcast.

2861
01:46:45,531 --> 01:46:48,970
He means brian and he barely sat in an 
account together.

2862
01:46:49,030 --> 01:46:54,030
Mean what happens if you're on southwest
and you got to sit next to him to say 

2863
01:46:54,030 --> 01:46:54,030
it.
It's all about the lap band now.

2864
01:46:54,150 --> 01:46:55,680
Yeah.
What the fuck is this dude?

2865
01:46:55,681 --> 01:46:57,560
It's everywhere.
It's on every billboard there.

2866
01:46:57,720 --> 01:47:00,210
so gluttonous that,
you know,

2867
01:47:00,480 --> 01:47:05,480
you know,
there was a picture from a long time 

2868
01:47:05,480 --> 01:47:05,480
ago,
the beginning of the,

2869
01:47:05,480 --> 01:47:06,660
uh,
the 18th century or the 19th century,

2870
01:47:06,661 --> 01:47:11,661
there was like a carnival and they had 
the fat man in the carnival sideshow 

2871
01:47:11,661 --> 01:47:16,191
free spirited woman,
the fat man and the fat man wasn't 

2872
01:47:16,191 --> 01:47:16,191
nearly as big as ralphie may.

2873
01:47:16,191 --> 01:47:20,490
This guy was a freak back then we'll do 
what because people had a fucking work 

2874
01:47:20,490 --> 01:47:23,100
and move around that it's moving.
But it's also the average american diet,

2875
01:47:23,160 --> 01:47:25,020
the average american diet like three 
flavors,

2876
01:47:25,050 --> 01:47:30,050
fat,
sugar and salt that everywhere you're 

2877
01:47:30,050 --> 01:47:33,561
trained,
we have an entire generation of kids 

2878
01:47:33,561 --> 01:47:33,561
that will not eat food without ketchup 
on it.

2879
01:47:33,561 --> 01:47:35,130
Like they just won't.
They just have to catch up and catch up.

2880
01:47:35,131 --> 01:47:36,290
Chicken fingers and it's like,
do,

2881
01:47:36,330 --> 01:47:41,330
heaven forbid you take them out and I'll
give him some fish or try curry or 

2882
01:47:41,330 --> 01:47:41,330
something.
Like just,

2883
01:47:41,330 --> 01:47:41,360
oh no,
it's just.

2884
01:47:41,370 --> 01:47:42,910
And then you don't think about 
mcdonald's.

2885
01:47:43,540 --> 01:47:45,330
Get them young.
Right?

2886
01:47:45,331 --> 01:47:50,331
Yeah.
Well the thing is about like this lap 

2887
01:47:50,331 --> 01:47:51,861
band thing is what's really creepy about
is all you're doing is making the 

2888
01:47:51,861 --> 01:47:53,070
stomach smaller.
So that you get full quicker,

2889
01:47:53,160 --> 01:47:55,680
so all you have to do is just stop 
eating so much.

2890
01:47:55,710 --> 01:47:56,830
But it's not,
it's that simple.

2891
01:47:56,850 --> 01:47:58,500
It's,
it's hitting your dopamine receptors and

2892
01:47:58,520 --> 01:48:00,060
you've been trained for that and that's 
the only thing,

2893
01:48:00,061 --> 01:48:00,500
you know,
we,

2894
01:48:00,530 --> 01:48:01,360
we talk about,
you know,

2895
01:48:01,361 --> 01:48:03,900
can you just try and get half portion 
please?

2896
01:48:03,901 --> 01:48:05,260
Like it's huge now.
Right?

2897
01:48:05,261 --> 01:48:10,261
Right.
But when you're filling up and you have 

2898
01:48:10,261 --> 01:48:11,991
this lap band thing,
so you have this tiny baby fake stomach 

2899
01:48:11,991 --> 01:48:11,991
now and that little fake stomach filling
up.

2900
01:48:11,991 --> 01:48:14,010
Do you,
does your doberman receptors go off?

2901
01:48:14,011 --> 01:48:18,600
Do you get the chemicals that sale it?
Dude,

2902
01:48:18,601 --> 01:48:23,601
it's on every billboard and apparently 
the surgery is not invasive enough that 

2903
01:48:23,601 --> 01:48:26,461
it's the point it's going to be like 
you've watched people get the lap band 

2904
01:48:26,461 --> 01:48:26,461
installed in the mall,
like laser eye surgery.

2905
01:48:26,461 --> 01:48:26,850
Right?
Like I do that dental.

2906
01:48:26,851 --> 01:48:28,470
Why'd they get your lap band while 
you're at it?

2907
01:48:28,471 --> 01:48:29,090
Right.
You know,

2908
01:48:29,100 --> 01:48:32,160
it.
Isn't it like a shitty fix to a problem.

2909
01:48:32,160 --> 01:48:34,530
That's obviously a lifestyle and diet 
problems.

2910
01:48:34,560 --> 01:48:35,910
Somebody saw profit.
Right?

2911
01:48:35,911 --> 01:48:37,050
And yeah,
I mean that's true.

2912
01:48:37,051 --> 01:48:38,820
I mean obviously like the shake weight.
Yeah.

2913
01:48:38,880 --> 01:48:43,880
Well,
what's so weird though is like when you 

2914
01:48:43,880 --> 01:48:43,880
talk to somebody that's like insanely 
obese,

2915
01:48:44,720 --> 01:48:46,950
I know he's drunk,
she's drunk,

2916
01:48:46,960 --> 01:48:47,910
sled,
don't do that.

2917
01:48:48,290 --> 01:48:51,010
I'm drinking a bottle.
She licks,

2918
01:48:51,890 --> 01:48:53,850
he's used to list looking cylindrical 
things in your home,

2919
01:48:54,210 --> 01:48:56,580
but it's like you talked to these people
and they're always like,

2920
01:48:56,760 --> 01:48:58,950
I don't even know what the problem is.
It's fibroids.

2921
01:48:59,100 --> 01:49:00,600
This is that.
I'm on a diet.

2922
01:49:00,720 --> 01:49:02,550
But then you hear the other stories were
like,

2923
01:49:02,551 --> 01:49:07,551
no dude,
he went to jack in the box and pretty 

2924
01:49:07,551 --> 01:49:10,071
much ordered like 13.
I honestly think it's the same thing as 

2925
01:49:10,071 --> 01:49:12,000
the guy who just works out to the point 
where it looks like he's just comedic.

2926
01:49:12,060 --> 01:49:13,740
I think it's,
it's an addiction.

2927
01:49:14,190 --> 01:49:15,470
I honestly think it is.
Yeah,

2928
01:49:15,471 --> 01:49:17,130
I guess so.
But that's a little more.

2929
01:49:17,131 --> 01:49:20,400
That's a different kind of totally 
different kinds of craziness.

2930
01:49:21,090 --> 01:49:26,090
The crazy,
the fat craziness is just like they're 

2931
01:49:26,090 --> 01:49:26,090
just trying to die or something.
You know,

2932
01:49:26,090 --> 01:49:30,441
like I have a friend who I know has like
a massive food addiction and just 

2933
01:49:31,561 --> 01:49:33,510
anytime he's around fast food,
he just,

2934
01:49:33,511 --> 01:49:35,290
he can't drive by a jacket.
Oh yes.

2935
01:49:35,550 --> 01:49:39,030
He's going to go in and you're trained 
at a young age to enjoy those flavors.

2936
01:49:39,031 --> 01:49:41,330
also mad and it's,
it's a stealth calorie thing also.

2937
01:49:41,690 --> 01:49:43,190
I mean,
he knows he's fat.

2938
01:49:43,191 --> 01:49:48,191
He's on talks about it.
He's trying to do things and never has 

2939
01:49:48,191 --> 01:49:50,410
done anything and you know,
if you know in your head that you should

2940
01:49:50,860 --> 01:49:55,860
stop doing this and you have a problem,
it's very strange that you can't rewire 

2941
01:49:55,860 --> 01:49:56,320
your brain to recognize that like,
oh,

2942
01:49:56,321 --> 01:49:57,820
this is something I'm aware of now.

2943
01:49:57,910 --> 01:49:59,190
Now I just need to stop.
It's a.

2944
01:49:59,240 --> 01:50:03,070
Once people get set on a certain path,
then at a certain point they just go,

2945
01:50:03,071 --> 01:50:03,460
right,
right.

2946
01:50:03,461 --> 01:50:05,020
Breaking that cycle is the hardest 
thing.

2947
01:50:05,050 --> 01:50:06,430
Right?
But why does that exist?

2948
01:50:06,460 --> 01:50:08,770
The big question is why is that in our 
system?

2949
01:50:08,950 --> 01:50:13,950
Why is it,
is it the same thing that allows us to 

2950
01:50:13,950 --> 01:50:13,950
get obsessed with things and get really 
good at things?

2951
01:50:13,950 --> 01:50:16,630
Is it like a bastardization?
How do we all know what borders are now?

2952
01:50:16,631 --> 01:50:18,490
My grandpa was a hoarder when she died.
My,

2953
01:50:18,491 --> 01:50:23,491
uh,
my uncle wound up having to clean out 

2954
01:50:23,491 --> 01:50:25,681
her place.
I remember as a kid going to visit her 

2955
01:50:25,681 --> 01:50:27,690
and she would have stacks of national 
geographic five feet high with her goat 

2956
01:50:27,690 --> 01:50:27,690
paths.
We'd have to navigate.

2957
01:50:27,690 --> 01:50:29,470
You go to the bathroom to pee in her 
bathtub.

2958
01:50:29,471 --> 01:50:31,930
Was used to have bags of clothes in it.

2959
01:50:31,980 --> 01:50:36,980
She'd never really.
We always wondering why grandma smelled 

2960
01:50:36,980 --> 01:50:36,980
sweaty and you know,
she wouldn't.

2961
01:50:36,980 --> 01:50:37,060
Didn't wear deodorant,
joe,

2962
01:50:37,061 --> 01:50:38,820
but my grandmother was the same way.
Your,

2963
01:50:38,900 --> 01:50:40,660
your grandmother didn't wear deodorant 
up?

2964
01:50:40,690 --> 01:50:41,380
Clearly?
Not.

2965
01:50:41,381 --> 01:50:46,381
Why not?
Maybe she just didn't think it was okay 

2966
01:50:46,381 --> 01:50:46,420
to plug up her armpits with stuff.
I'm interested to wear deodorant.

2967
01:50:46,421 --> 01:50:49,740
I just don't wear antiperspirant.
One thing is just smell.

2968
01:50:49,741 --> 01:50:50,680
Just giving shit,
man.

2969
01:50:50,710 --> 01:50:52,930
Stopping the.
My grandmother was completely crazy.

2970
01:50:53,170 --> 01:50:55,060
My grandmother when she died was exactly
the same thing.

2971
01:50:55,061 --> 01:50:56,890
They had a.
They had a clean out her.

2972
01:50:56,891 --> 01:51:01,891
My uncle.
I think it's a control thing when you 

2973
01:51:01,891 --> 01:51:01,891
give her much borders.
Yes.

2974
01:51:01,891 --> 01:51:04,180
Usually the husband obsession husbands,
some train wreck and the.

2975
01:51:04,220 --> 01:51:06,490
Something's gone south,
so it's this one thing that they can.

2976
01:51:06,550 --> 01:51:08,290
They can control and in their life,
right.

2977
01:51:08,291 --> 01:51:13,291
It may be,
but she was insane about a bunch of 

2978
01:51:13,291 --> 01:51:15,211
different things,
but the whole house was just stacks of 

2979
01:51:15,211 --> 01:51:15,820
boxes and no one knew anything and it's 
never anything valuable.

2980
01:51:15,820 --> 01:51:20,820
It's usually just little.
She had a lot of money that she didn't 

2981
01:51:20,820 --> 01:51:21,220
even probably know she had like $30,000
was stored in the house,

2982
01:51:21,221 --> 01:51:24,490
some some ridiculous number and they 
were broke and it was really because she

2983
01:51:24,491 --> 01:51:27,070
had grown up in the recession and when 
you grew up in the recession,

2984
01:51:27,071 --> 01:51:28,930
you're like constantly worried you're 
going to run out of money,

2985
01:51:29,030 --> 01:51:31,960
can stash our parents,
and our grandparents were always like,

2986
01:51:31,961 --> 01:51:32,740
no,
you're going to finish that.

2987
01:51:32,741 --> 01:51:35,650
You're going to take that home.
And now this current generation is like,

2988
01:51:35,651 --> 01:51:36,160
eh,
screw it.

2989
01:51:36,161 --> 01:51:36,700
I don't need it.
Right.

2990
01:51:36,710 --> 01:51:39,130
She had an aneurysm and she forgot where
everything was.

2991
01:51:39,280 --> 01:51:44,280
So she had all these fucking cans around
the house and nobody found until she 

2992
01:51:44,280 --> 01:51:44,500
died.
So it was like 12 years.

2993
01:51:44,590 --> 01:51:45,160
She.
Yeah.

2994
01:51:45,250 --> 01:51:50,250
They gave her 72 hours to live.
She had a massive aneurysm and nobody 

2995
01:51:50,250 --> 01:51:50,250
found it for a long time.

2996
01:51:50,250 --> 01:51:52,540
I came outside and she was just jacked 
and so,

2997
01:51:52,541 --> 01:51:53,230
uh,
they uh,

2998
01:51:53,260 --> 01:51:55,150
they brought her into the hospital and 
then they're like,

2999
01:51:55,180 --> 01:51:56,800
you know,
maybe she's got 72 hours.

3000
01:51:56,801 --> 01:51:59,320
Maybe she lived 12 years.
Wow.

3001
01:51:59,350 --> 01:52:01,440
12 sicilian peasant genes,
bro.

3002
01:52:02,460 --> 01:52:07,460
Diehard right.
Karen rocks up hills for generation 

3003
01:52:07,460 --> 01:52:07,540
after generation.
Josh ortega,

3004
01:52:07,541 --> 01:52:12,541
he wrote a gears to had one point where 
he was an apartment manager department 

3005
01:52:12,541 --> 01:52:13,470
and he got a phone call that this person
had the strange fluid like that.

3006
01:52:13,471 --> 01:52:14,830
They assumed it was a sewer leak above 
the rest.

3007
01:52:14,831 --> 01:52:16,520
Something like the dead person.
Yeah.

3008
01:52:16,840 --> 01:52:17,620
Yeah.
He called it.

3009
01:52:17,621 --> 01:52:19,930
He called him like it was a cop or some 
sort of cleaner guy.

3010
01:52:19,970 --> 01:52:20,570
Touch it,
smell.

3011
01:52:20,571 --> 01:52:25,571
It was like you got death above you.
The guy got had died and bloated and 

3012
01:52:25,571 --> 01:52:26,590
actually soaked through.
Oh boy.

3013
01:52:26,750 --> 01:52:28,500
And he,
once they took the body out,

3014
01:52:28,510 --> 01:52:32,050
josh actually had to clean all that out.
You can't clean the ceiling.

3015
01:52:32,051 --> 01:52:34,750
You have to cut it out,
suck through.

3016
01:52:34,900 --> 01:52:39,900
The smell does not go away.
Or the wallboard leaking through the 

3017
01:52:39,900 --> 01:52:41,740
wall board.
You've got a body and your ceiling.

3018
01:52:42,190 --> 01:52:46,070
Would you live somewhere like a place 
that somebody had been

3019
01:52:46,070 --> 01:52:48,200
murdered at?
No.

3020
01:52:48,290 --> 01:52:48,950
You wouldn't?
No,

3021
01:52:48,951 --> 01:52:50,180
I don't think I would.
And you know,

3022
01:52:50,181 --> 01:52:53,510
one of the reasons why I don't think I 
would is I really honestly believed that

3023
01:52:53,511 --> 01:52:56,840
there's something to the.
I think it was rupert sheldrake,

3024
01:52:56,880 --> 01:53:01,880
who's a evolutionary biologist,
had this idea that everything has some 

3025
01:53:01,880 --> 01:53:05,351
sort of a memory.
I believe it was his idea that memory 

3026
01:53:05,351 --> 01:53:09,341
doesn't just exist in the human mind,
but that objects and things have memory 

3027
01:53:09,341 --> 01:53:12,941
and the world around you.
that's one reason why you can come into 

3028
01:53:12,941 --> 01:53:13,750
certain buildings and creepy shit has 
happened there and you know,

3029
01:53:14,090 --> 01:53:15,770
people are fucking flakes,
man.

3030
01:53:15,950 --> 01:53:17,330
People tell you they can read their 
paul,

3031
01:53:17,331 --> 01:53:21,110
your palm or I sent you a good person.
There's a lot of weirdos that talk crazy

3032
01:53:21,111 --> 01:53:23,470
spiritual talk,
but there's California,

3033
01:53:23,520 --> 01:53:24,890
there's for sure,
right.

3034
01:53:24,891 --> 01:53:26,810
Everybody out here wants to be special 
without working for it,

3035
01:53:27,140 --> 01:53:29,870
but for sure there's something about 
feelings.

3036
01:53:30,110 --> 01:53:30,920
You know,
there's some,

3037
01:53:30,940 --> 01:53:35,940
some,
there's some fields that you get for 

3038
01:53:35,940 --> 01:53:37,931
some places and so many people have had 
like gone into a house where someone's 

3039
01:53:37,931 --> 01:53:42,821
been murdered and no one even has to 
tell them and they feel terrible about 

3040
01:53:42,821 --> 01:53:43,100
the house and the house has a nice 
house.

3041
01:53:43,310 --> 01:53:45,580
There's been so many stories about 
something like that.

3042
01:53:45,590 --> 01:53:48,170
The wallpaper is murder somebody in 
there.

3043
01:53:48,700 --> 01:53:49,130
Dude,
you know what?

3044
01:53:49,220 --> 01:53:54,220
I think ghosts aren't just.
There aren't just potentially these 

3045
01:53:54,220 --> 01:53:54,220
things that exist around here.
I think it's like a memory,

3046
01:53:54,220 --> 01:53:55,100
right?
As far as uh,

3047
01:53:55,520 --> 01:53:57,050
there's this awesome game system shock 
two.

3048
01:53:57,051 --> 01:53:57,880
Do you ever play it?
Yeah.

3049
01:53:58,160 --> 01:54:03,160
And they used to,
they basically had these implants that 

3050
01:54:03,160 --> 01:54:05,111
allowed you to see the memories that 
people right before they died and he 

3051
01:54:05,111 --> 01:54:05,111
come up with,
come up with.

3052
01:54:05,111 --> 01:54:05,390
IT was a great storytelling thing 
because a ghost,

3053
01:54:05,500 --> 01:54:06,610
he couldn't interfere with the cuts.

3054
01:54:06,650 --> 01:54:08,210
He couldn't shoot the guy before he did 
the thing.

3055
01:54:08,420 --> 01:54:13,420
You just saw the last like eight seconds
of his life play out and he came up the 

3056
01:54:13,420 --> 01:54:14,840
elevator shaft and this guy in front of 
you who's standing there with a shotgun,

3057
01:54:14,841 --> 01:54:15,560
he was like,
I'm sorry,

3058
01:54:15,561 --> 01:54:17,300
you know this,
the space station has gone to hell.

3059
01:54:17,301 --> 01:54:18,290
I can't deal with this.
You know,

3060
01:54:18,291 --> 01:54:21,050
lee and the kids forgive me and he,
you see him put the gun in his mouth and

3061
01:54:21,051 --> 01:54:22,570
it phases out.
Well,

3062
01:54:22,760 --> 01:54:27,760
they use that throughout.
Right as an amazing storytelling 

3063
01:54:27,760 --> 01:54:27,760
technique.
Right.

3064
01:54:27,760 --> 01:54:27,760
It's classic stuff,
man.

3065
01:54:27,760 --> 01:54:32,040
Right.
He brought it back to gaming right 

3066
01:54:32,040 --> 01:54:34,091
there.
Did you see the mario kart started that 

3067
01:54:34,091 --> 01:54:34,730
with the.
Goes around the track that.

3068
01:54:34,740 --> 01:54:36,020
Yeah,
exactly.

3069
01:54:36,021 --> 01:54:38,150
That was you compete against yourself,
right?

3070
01:54:38,160 --> 01:54:39,260
Yeah,
exactly,

3071
01:54:39,900 --> 01:54:44,900
dude.
And now we're all figuring out how to 

3072
01:54:44,900 --> 01:54:44,900
basically have different types of events
happen online.

3073
01:54:44,900 --> 01:54:44,900
You know,
like angry birds.

3074
01:54:44,900 --> 01:54:46,880
You were saying now they're doing like 
the holiday edition.

3075
01:54:46,970 --> 01:54:49,460
Right.
But they're handling it right to man.

3076
01:54:49,461 --> 01:54:54,461
Those,
those people didn't charge anything for 

3077
01:54:54,461 --> 01:54:54,461
that game and then they've been updating
it and you know,

3078
01:54:54,461 --> 01:54:59,060
patching it.
I wouldn't be if I finished angry birds 

3079
01:54:59,060 --> 01:54:59,060
and then there was a screen to come up.
It came up and said,

3080
01:54:59,060 --> 01:55:03,941
hey,
you could have 30 more levels for 30 

3081
01:55:03,941 --> 01:55:03,941
bucks.
That would have been like,

3082
01:55:03,941 --> 01:55:03,941
yes,
yes,

3083
01:55:03,941 --> 01:55:07,121
and my first born please.
They're treating it right though and I 

3084
01:55:07,121 --> 01:55:08,150
mean they make money,
they get it,

3085
01:55:08,151 --> 01:55:10,460
they sold the game.
They're giving a lot away for free right

3086
01:55:10,461 --> 01:55:15,461
now,
but they weren't you just saying that 

3087
01:55:15,461 --> 01:55:16,931
they have some like ninety nine cent 
like eagle that'll take out the whole 

3088
01:55:16,931 --> 01:55:19,691
level for you that they've been.
They've been planning what they have 

3089
01:55:19,691 --> 01:55:21,731
that and they also had like the 
halloween pack and then they also have 

3090
01:55:21,731 --> 01:55:21,731
the whole new christmas pack.

3091
01:55:21,731 --> 01:55:23,150
No,
you can't just play all the levels.

3092
01:55:23,151 --> 01:55:28,151
it's an advent calendar sooner.
You can only play one level on each day 

3093
01:55:28,151 --> 01:55:28,610
so you can't just burn through them all 
in one night,

3094
01:55:28,611 --> 01:55:31,640
but it's such a well designed game that 
you're just going to keep coming back.

3095
01:55:31,641 --> 01:55:32,300
Right?
Totally.

3096
01:55:32,330 --> 01:55:34,050
So simple.
Perfect kind of ios game,

3097
01:55:34,051 --> 01:55:36,390
just doo doo doo doo doot.
Definitely tablets,

3098
01:55:36,391 --> 01:55:37,580
swipe baby.
that's the way to go.

3099
01:55:38,320 --> 01:55:40,930
Everything's turning into applications.
To have you notice,

3100
01:55:40,970 --> 01:55:45,970
notice that nowadays you're not paying 
money for like a magazines,

3101
01:55:46,771 --> 01:55:51,771
you're not paying money for,
for this and that you're now having 

3102
01:55:51,771 --> 01:55:52,560
applications and apps.
Apps are just fancy programs,

3103
01:55:52,561 --> 01:55:54,220
right?
That are just smaller,

3104
01:55:54,720 --> 01:55:56,490
well maintained.
The personal.

3105
01:55:56,820 --> 01:55:59,010
You're taking these apps with you on the
road.

3106
01:55:59,011 --> 01:56:01,150
A loT of people are concerned with on 
the internet right now that like,

3107
01:56:01,170 --> 01:56:03,300
it's no longer as a series of linked 
websites.

3108
01:56:03,300 --> 01:56:04,680
It's huge.
It's facebook,

3109
01:56:04,681 --> 01:56:09,681
it's various kind of silos of 
information where it's all self 

3110
01:56:09,681 --> 01:56:09,681
contained within that.
Right.

3111
01:56:09,681 --> 01:56:09,681
The thing that,
you know,

3112
01:56:09,681 --> 01:56:10,470
again,
I like facebook,

3113
01:56:10,471 --> 01:56:11,310
I think it's cool.
You know,

3114
01:56:11,311 --> 01:56:13,080
I like stalking people.
I went to high school with.

3115
01:56:13,081 --> 01:56:17,760
It's cool at the same time,
like the fact that every website I go to

3116
01:56:17,761 --> 01:56:20,760
now has like a facebook integrated now,
right?

3117
01:56:20,761 --> 01:56:25,761
We're like,
I don't necessarily want somebody 

3118
01:56:25,761 --> 01:56:27,330
knowing I go to one website and 
accidentally click like broadcast 

3119
01:56:27,330 --> 01:56:27,330
because,
uh,

3120
01:56:27,330 --> 01:56:28,590
you know,
any comments,

3121
01:56:28,591 --> 01:56:30,560
you can make comments on these a lot.
Oh,

3122
01:56:30,570 --> 01:56:35,570
absolutely.
And you do it through your facebook log 

3123
01:56:35,570 --> 01:56:35,570
into your facebook.
I'm like,

3124
01:56:35,570 --> 01:56:36,000
wait a minute,
where's my password going?

3125
01:56:36,001 --> 01:56:38,640
How do you know what's going on?
I'll never forget you connecting.

3126
01:56:38,880 --> 01:56:41,040
I'm allowing you to connect through my 
facebook.

3127
01:56:41,070 --> 01:56:42,690
So here's a question for you.
If you.

3128
01:56:42,790 --> 01:56:46,470
If you could have perfect memory,
like day to day,

3129
01:56:46,530 --> 01:56:50,190
you will remember everything when you 
were 10 years old every single day,

3130
01:56:50,430 --> 01:56:52,050
but it had advertising in it.

3131
01:56:52,140 --> 01:56:54,690
Let you do it know it already did.
Dude,

3132
01:56:54,810 --> 01:56:57,300
that's fascinating.
That's a very good question.

3133
01:56:57,301 --> 01:57:00,510
So like I want to go from August 4th,
19,

3134
01:57:00,511 --> 01:57:02,510
74,
3:00

3135
01:57:02,510 --> 01:57:02,760
PM.
They're like,

3136
01:57:02,761 --> 01:57:07,761
okay,
this is sponsored by gecko who go to 

3137
01:57:07,761 --> 01:57:07,761
[inaudible] dot com and you're like,
fine,

3138
01:57:07,761 --> 01:57:07,761
fine,
whatever.

3139
01:57:07,761 --> 01:57:07,890
Then you're like,
bam.

3140
01:57:08,100 --> 01:57:11,040
Now you have that day in front of you on
video of course,

3141
01:57:11,610 --> 01:57:12,870
because we're all living in their 
memories.

3142
01:57:12,990 --> 01:57:14,310
Right?
Or that thought.

3143
01:57:14,311 --> 01:57:16,560
At least you would definitely.
But then you would say,

3144
01:57:16,561 --> 01:57:17,430
well,
where's the store?

3145
01:57:17,431 --> 01:57:18,530
Does this nonlocal?
No,

3146
01:57:18,531 --> 01:57:18,780
no,
no,

3147
01:57:18,781 --> 01:57:21,130
no.
It's like divek circuit city.

3148
01:57:21,131 --> 01:57:22,360
Yeah,
that's the thing.

3149
01:57:22,890 --> 01:57:25,860
There's a story on.
I'll pull up this shit on my own.

3150
01:57:26,030 --> 01:57:28,800
They were able to surgically kind of 
removes certain memories for mice.

3151
01:57:30,030 --> 01:57:35,030
They've started to come through.
Some of that is technology like eternal 

3152
01:57:35,030 --> 01:57:37,071
sunshine of the spotless mind,
so if you're a ptsd sufferer and you 

3153
01:57:37,071 --> 01:57:40,311
have traumatic events that Afghanistan,
they can surgically remove the stuff 

3154
01:57:40,311 --> 01:57:40,311
that happened to you so that you can 
move on.

3155
01:57:40,311 --> 01:57:43,620
Since there's some dude that you fucking
hate in Afghanistan all sudden you're in

3156
01:57:43,621 --> 01:57:45,120
New York and he sees you like,
yo,

3157
01:57:45,540 --> 01:57:46,500
fuck,
and you're like,

3158
01:57:46,501 --> 01:57:49,170
I don't even know this dude.
That's not cool.

3159
01:57:49,620 --> 01:57:54,620
Yeah,
this guy would hate you and he'd be 

3160
01:57:54,620 --> 01:57:54,620
following you around.
You're like,

3161
01:57:54,620 --> 01:57:54,620
what is this dude's deal?
Or you get out,

3162
01:57:54,620 --> 01:57:56,340
get out of a bad relationship and you're
killed.

3163
01:57:56,341 --> 01:57:59,790
Everyone he knows when and he made me 
make the iron man outfit,

3164
01:58:00,060 --> 01:58:00,480
right?
Yeah.

3165
01:58:00,481 --> 01:58:05,481
You get out of bad relationship and 
meanwhile she still remembers you and 

3166
01:58:05,481 --> 01:58:05,481
she's fucking sharp in an upward 
daggers.

3167
01:58:05,481 --> 01:58:10,090
She was like traveling over the trailer 
behind the condom can break to get you 

3168
01:58:10,090 --> 01:58:10,650
arrested for.
She's got all sorts of outfits.

3169
01:58:10,651 --> 01:58:15,651
She's like blade and shit.
She's got a trench coat filled with 

3170
01:58:15,651 --> 01:58:18,051
weapons looking to take you out.
Blissfully unaware of the fact that 

3171
01:58:18,051 --> 01:58:18,051
they're starting to make these 
breakthroughs.

3172
01:58:18,051 --> 01:58:20,010
Right?
There's a breakthrough in nanotechnology

3173
01:58:20,011 --> 01:58:25,011
that happened,
I think it was about a year ago where 

3174
01:58:25,011 --> 01:58:26,391
they were able to figure out how to 
actually have a cells that were bonded 

3175
01:58:26,391 --> 01:58:27,560
in an injection that would actually then
melts a,

3176
01:58:27,561 --> 01:58:32,561
a,
a tumor that was a tumorous growth like 

3177
01:58:32,561 --> 01:58:33,150
without any sort of radiation treatment 
or anything like that.

3178
01:58:33,151 --> 01:58:34,160
Right.
It's just,

3179
01:58:34,350 --> 01:58:36,060
it's right in the fridge right now,
right.

3180
01:58:36,061 --> 01:58:38,220
Like hAve so many diseases and 
everything like that,

3181
01:58:38,221 --> 01:58:41,390
like it might actually happen within our
lifetimes and forget about your kids.

3182
01:58:41,420 --> 01:58:42,070
It's not just

3183
01:58:42,070 --> 01:58:43,960
happening in,
in technology,

3184
01:58:43,961 --> 01:58:48,961
it's happening in space.
Like all the shit that they're finding 

3185
01:58:48,961 --> 01:58:48,961
out about space as well.

3186
01:58:48,961 --> 01:58:53,210
Are you following any of the astronauts 
on the international space station on 

3187
01:58:53,210 --> 01:58:53,450
twitter?
Know there's that guy dig up.

3188
01:58:53,460 --> 01:58:54,530
His name is,
uh,

3189
01:58:54,760 --> 01:58:57,210
he's been just tweeting photos of like 
amazing,

3190
01:58:57,211 --> 01:58:59,690
like,
like sun sunsets from,

3191
01:58:59,750 --> 01:59:01,080
from space,
from the space station.

3192
01:59:01,081 --> 01:59:02,480
like somehow they hooked up,
you know,

3193
01:59:02,481 --> 01:59:04,790
he's an internet connection up there and
he has like $300.

3194
01:59:05,200 --> 01:59:07,650
twitter.
He's like,

3195
01:59:07,651 --> 01:59:08,130
hey,
look at this,

3196
01:59:08,530 --> 01:59:09,450
this his name's,
um,

3197
01:59:09,540 --> 01:59:14,540
I guess that you sound not gucci.
It's a astro underscore,

3198
01:59:14,761 --> 01:59:17,310
soi.
Chi has got 300,000

3199
01:59:17,311 --> 01:59:18,840
followers and he's like,
hey look,

3200
01:59:18,841 --> 01:59:21,770
we're taking off and to go to the space 
station and he's just got this following

3201
01:59:21,771 --> 01:59:23,610
and like these making space travel.
Cool again.

3202
01:59:23,611 --> 01:59:24,480
Right.
Whereas you know,

3203
01:59:24,520 --> 01:59:26,850
you joke about kids who want to be mma 
fighters,

3204
01:59:26,851 --> 01:59:29,220
video game designers.
Now this guy's doing that for the job.

3205
01:59:29,221 --> 01:59:31,190
Right.
Which I think is really cool when he.

3206
01:59:33,130 --> 01:59:34,660
Yeah,
I actually do follow that guy.

3207
01:59:34,720 --> 01:59:36,490
I have seen some of his cool stuff.
I forgot.

3208
01:59:36,520 --> 01:59:37,930
I think also many people are forgot.

3209
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:40,600
They compile it on the huffington post 
once in a while you just look at it just

3210
01:59:40,601 --> 01:59:41,960
to go through just like,
this is amazing.

3211
01:59:41,961 --> 01:59:46,961
There's so many things that are just so 
crazy that are unmissed not even 

3212
01:59:46,961 --> 01:59:49,601
understood about this world.
The whole lake arsenic based life form 

3213
01:59:49,601 --> 01:59:49,601
stuff they came up with.

3214
01:59:49,601 --> 01:59:51,150
I know what they found out that that was
bad science.

3215
01:59:51,210 --> 01:59:51,840
Really?
Yeah.

3216
01:59:51,841 --> 01:59:56,841
That was very poorly written and that 
nasa nasa rushed to try to get this 

3217
01:59:56,841 --> 02:00:01,491
press conference or this press release 
out there before it got reviewed by all 

3218
02:00:01,711 --> 02:00:06,711
the right people and there's a ton of 
criticism all over the internet that 

3219
02:00:06,711 --> 02:00:10,881
what they did was they drew some really 
unscientific conclusions and and kind of

3220
02:00:11,191 --> 02:00:12,390
a.
It's not,

3221
02:00:12,420 --> 02:00:15,150
it's not.
It's not disproven completely,

3222
02:00:15,360 --> 02:00:16,990
but it's not proven either.
It's a,

3223
02:00:17,220 --> 02:00:20,910
it's not ready yet and it's kind of like
contact where they're not really sure if

3224
02:00:20,911 --> 02:00:22,550
jodie foster really went to the other 
world,

3225
02:00:22,600 --> 02:00:23,910
some nutty shit going on.
Man.

3226
02:00:23,911 --> 02:00:26,430
Have you heard about this new object 
that they found outside of pluto?

3227
02:00:26,431 --> 02:00:30,240
That's jupiter sized really just out of 
nowhere way the fuck out there,

3228
02:00:30,241 --> 02:00:35,241
like probably as far or more from 
jupiter as we are from jupiter or excuse

3229
02:00:35,401 --> 02:00:40,401
me,
from pluto rather as we are from pluto 

3230
02:00:40,401 --> 02:00:40,500
and it's outside of pluto and it's 
gigantic.

3231
02:00:40,860 --> 02:00:43,440
They don't know what it is.
They have no idea where it is exactly,

3232
02:00:43,441 --> 02:00:44,540
but they know there's something out 
there.

3233
02:00:44,570 --> 02:00:46,950
They're pretty sure.
I knOw you've probably talked about this

3234
02:00:46,951 --> 02:00:48,050
in the area because you're big on aliens
to.

3235
02:00:48,060 --> 02:00:49,730
The whole idea with Stephen hawking was 
saying like,

3236
02:00:49,880 --> 02:00:51,990
no,
if aliens actually find us first,

3237
02:00:51,991 --> 02:00:56,991
then it's going to be a situation where 
were the native americans and then it's 

3238
02:00:56,991 --> 02:00:57,270
everybody else coming over from europe.
It didn't turn out very well.

3239
02:00:57,330 --> 02:01:00,030
or were monkeys were not even native 
americans.

3240
02:01:00,031 --> 02:01:01,980
Man,
native americans released human,

3241
02:01:02,140 --> 02:01:07,140
you know?
I mean if something is a million years 

3242
02:01:07,140 --> 02:01:09,111
more advanced than us,
it's going to be like us collecting 

3243
02:01:09,111 --> 02:01:09,111
bugs.
LIke again,

3244
02:01:09,111 --> 02:01:12,661
like I said,
your kids are probably going to live to 

3245
02:01:12,661 --> 02:01:12,661
be 150 plus to see this.
If not,

3246
02:01:13,350 --> 02:01:14,790
if not you.
Who knows?

3247
02:01:14,791 --> 02:01:16,710
Man,
who knows what the fuck is going on,

3248
02:01:16,960 --> 02:01:19,200
the breakthroughs that they're coming in
to live to 1:50

3249
02:01:19,201 --> 02:01:22,020
working in video games.
Would you stress?

3250
02:01:22,620 --> 02:01:27,620
Yeah.
Maybe we'll just kick back and go jay z 

3251
02:01:27,620 --> 02:01:27,630
style.
Once you compile all your money,

3252
02:01:27,670 --> 02:01:28,360
dude,
dude,

3253
02:01:28,760 --> 02:01:32,220
dude,
because the developers,

3254
02:01:32,370 --> 02:01:37,370
the people who have the money or the 
people that put up the money and those 

3255
02:01:37,370 --> 02:01:40,341
are the people that make all the money's
at what's going on and that it's much 

3256
02:01:40,341 --> 02:01:40,341
harder for the developers to go jz 
style.

3257
02:01:40,400 --> 02:01:41,390
It is.
Yeah.

3258
02:01:41,550 --> 02:01:41,960
You get.
WeLl,

3259
02:01:41,961 --> 02:01:46,961
you get to the point where it's.
It's so hard for one person to really 

3260
02:01:46,961 --> 02:01:47,000
break out and do his own thing,
especially in the triple a space because

3261
02:01:47,240 --> 02:01:52,240
you're seeing where it used games and 
rentals are eating up so much of the 

3262
02:01:52,240 --> 02:01:52,690
market that for somebody to spend,
you know,

3263
02:01:52,691 --> 02:01:55,310
millions millions of dollars to make a 
game and that to actually launch it with

3264
02:01:55,311 --> 02:02:00,311
all the marketing is a huge risk.
And then so a lot of people are turning 

3265
02:02:00,311 --> 02:02:00,311
to mobile that running to all these 
different kinds of places.

3266
02:02:00,311 --> 02:02:04,751
Right?
But I would think that at a certain 

3267
02:02:04,751 --> 02:02:04,751
level,
like your level,

3268
02:02:04,751 --> 02:02:05,780
when you have a certain reputation 
behind you,

3269
02:02:05,960 --> 02:02:09,860
that it might be easier for a bunch of 
people to come to you and say,

3270
02:02:09,861 --> 02:02:11,720
listen man,
you're a proven commodity.

3271
02:02:11,721 --> 02:02:13,520
Why don't you get your team and you 
know,

3272
02:02:13,521 --> 02:02:16,120
we'll give you guys a cut of the 
publishing hypothetical.

3273
02:02:16,130 --> 02:02:21,130
I knew what he did an early age that by 
doing the pr and being able to have a 

3274
02:02:21,130 --> 02:02:24,401
little bit of a theater background and 
go on stage and this stuff would get me 

3275
02:02:24,401 --> 02:02:24,401
a certain amount of leverage and then by
working with talented people,

3276
02:02:24,401 --> 02:02:26,330
making great games,
I have built a brand for myself.

3277
02:02:26,840 --> 02:02:31,840
So hypothetically I could probably go 
knock on a lot of publishers toward to 

3278
02:02:31,840 --> 02:02:31,840
mom and be like,
just give me a bunch of money.

3279
02:02:31,840 --> 02:02:31,910
Let me build a team,
do whatever I want.

3280
02:02:32,300 --> 02:02:36,440
The problem is epic takes good care of 
me and I worked with everybody and I get

3281
02:02:36,441 --> 02:02:39,800
to do the shit I want and I know I've 
got a great setup,

3282
02:02:39,801 --> 02:02:42,560
so why fuck with it for something that 
may or may not work out.

3283
02:02:42,561 --> 02:02:47,561
Right.
That explosion was brian fucking around 

3284
02:02:47,561 --> 02:02:49,911
in the background.
What do you think that the world's 

3285
02:02:49,911 --> 02:02:49,911
coming to an end.

3286
02:02:49,911 --> 02:02:50,930
What do you think the current,
a lifespan of the consoles are?

3287
02:02:50,931 --> 02:02:53,720
Leg until the new year?
We have for the first time ever in video

3288
02:02:53,721 --> 02:02:58,721
games,
we've just gotten past the five year 

3289
02:02:58,721 --> 02:02:58,721
lifecycle.
Yeah.

3290
02:02:58,721 --> 02:03:00,560
It seems reason yet is I think for a lot
of people graphics or quote good enough.

3291
02:03:00,620 --> 02:03:01,370
Yeah.
Right,

3292
02:03:01,371 --> 02:03:03,860
and like what if,
if you were to put something new on tv,

3293
02:03:03,861 --> 02:03:07,220
that's what is the current state of the 
art versus the latest playstation.

3294
02:03:07,280 --> 02:03:10,280
Xbox game would've passed the mom test,
which your mom look at that and go,

3295
02:03:10,281 --> 02:03:11,990
that looks amazing.
Compare to that.

3296
02:03:12,320 --> 02:03:14,030
Maybe.
Maybe not give it a couple of years.

3297
02:03:14,031 --> 02:03:15,170
Yes.
Right.

3298
02:03:15,171 --> 02:03:17,570
So right now maybe it's good enough.
You know,

3299
02:03:17,571 --> 02:03:19,340
you have all the emotion controls and 
everything like that.

3300
02:03:19,341 --> 02:03:20,750
They can kind of keep everybody 
occupied.

3301
02:03:20,870 --> 02:03:25,870
What do you think the next thing is?
What do you think is just going to be 

3302
02:03:25,870 --> 02:03:25,870
faster and bigger?

3303
02:03:25,870 --> 02:03:27,230
Or do you think there's going to be the 
personally.

3304
02:03:27,231 --> 02:03:28,400
Yeah,
my personal opinion,

3305
02:03:28,401 --> 02:03:30,290
personal opinion,
fastest hell,

3306
02:03:30,291 --> 02:03:32,990
avatar style graphics,
avatar level of graphics,

3307
02:03:33,590 --> 02:03:35,600
something that is always connected to 
the internet.

3308
02:03:35,780 --> 02:03:38,660
Is it ever going to come to a time where
that's easier to do than it is now?

3309
02:03:39,090 --> 02:03:40,820
What?
In regards to building the log,

3310
02:03:40,821 --> 02:03:42,050
building it,
creating it,

3311
02:03:42,140 --> 02:03:47,140
I mean there's things like that will,
there's ways that you can procedurally 

3312
02:03:47,140 --> 02:03:47,140
create content,
right?

3313
02:03:47,140 --> 02:03:51,851
Like we'll write it spore where like a 
lot of the textures were automatically 

3314
02:03:51,851 --> 02:03:54,100
created so we figured out what like a,
an algorithm would be for grass and wood

3315
02:03:54,101 --> 02:03:56,660
and things like that and there's a huge,
not huge,

3316
02:03:56,661 --> 02:03:58,760
but there's a subset of people that are 
working that technology like,

3317
02:03:58,761 --> 02:04:03,761
okay,
just hit a button and just generate 50 

3318
02:04:03,761 --> 02:04:03,761
types of wood for me so we don't 
actually have to build it.

3319
02:04:03,761 --> 02:04:07,330
Right.
Then you get to the point where there's 

3320
02:04:07,330 --> 02:04:08,681
a certain library of do I really need to
remodel the couch for the 8000000000th 

3321
02:04:08,681 --> 02:04:08,681
time?
Like work smarter,

3322
02:04:08,681 --> 02:04:08,681
not harder,
right?

3323
02:04:08,681 --> 02:04:10,430
Figure out ways to use more modular 
architecture.

3324
02:04:10,610 --> 02:04:12,550
Do you really need 50 columns of 
different types of.

3325
02:04:12,551 --> 02:04:13,880
You can just spit them all out,
right?

3326
02:04:14,150 --> 02:04:15,360
The key is going to be figuring out,
you know,

3327
02:04:15,361 --> 02:04:19,580
like how to craft that within a certain 
financial model.

3328
02:04:19,880 --> 02:04:22,760
That's the billion dollar question.
How do you put that aaa content.

3329
02:04:22,761 --> 02:04:23,510
That makes sense,
right?

3330
02:04:23,511 --> 02:04:28,511
Like hoW do you remain profitable?
Will there eventually you think will be 

3331
02:04:28,511 --> 02:04:31,390
software that makes it easy?
Like the average person can create 

3332
02:04:31,390 --> 02:04:31,390
games.
That's what we do.

3333
02:04:31,390 --> 02:04:33,950
That's half of our business.
You could go to utk.com

3334
02:04:33,951 --> 02:04:38,951
and download the same exact stuff we 
used to build our games for free so 

3335
02:04:38,951 --> 02:04:42,861
anybody can for free,
go and take your technology and make 

3336
02:04:42,861 --> 02:04:42,861
their own game.

3337
02:04:42,861 --> 02:04:47,510
They can.
The problem is of course if you start 

3338
02:04:47,510 --> 02:04:50,061
making money with it,
then you have to talk to us about 

3339
02:04:50,061 --> 02:04:50,061
officially licensing it.
Oh,

3340
02:04:50,061 --> 02:04:51,990
that's pretty funny actually,
but the reason why,

3341
02:04:52,170 --> 02:04:57,170
the reason why the smart is because you 
have so many college campuses out there 

3342
02:04:57,170 --> 02:05:00,741
that want to find a solution.
How do we train college kids to learn 

3343
02:05:00,741 --> 02:05:00,850
how to use this technology that goes to 
it?

3344
02:05:00,950 --> 02:05:04,950
Is it how hard your builder to builder 
or killed for these tools?

3345
02:05:04,951 --> 02:05:06,750
When I was 13?
Yes.

3346
02:05:06,930 --> 02:05:08,790
Now they're not making games hard.
Right?

3347
02:05:08,791 --> 02:05:11,190
Like you still have to know what to do,
but if I was myself,

3348
02:05:11,191 --> 02:05:16,191
17,
I would've been able to do such crazy 

3349
02:05:16,191 --> 02:05:16,191
shit.
Like I had to learn visual basic and get

3350
02:05:16,191 --> 02:05:16,920
a programmer.
You're the programmer.

3351
02:05:16,921 --> 02:05:21,921
I did jazz jack rabbit with back in the 
day is the guy who works in kill zone 

3352
02:05:21,921 --> 02:05:21,921
now.
It's just one of those weird like,

3353
02:05:21,921 --> 02:05:23,490
you know,
professor x mag needle type situations.

3354
02:05:23,491 --> 02:05:24,660
Right?
But he's cool guy,

3355
02:05:24,690 --> 02:05:25,850
great dutch dude.
Um,

3356
02:05:25,890 --> 02:05:27,780
but yeah,
like you can just go download it out and

3357
02:05:27,781 --> 02:05:32,781
start building games.
So I get these kids a tweet all the 

3358
02:05:32,781 --> 02:05:32,781
time.
How do we get the business?

3359
02:05:32,781 --> 02:05:32,781
How do we get the business?
I'm like,

3360
02:05:32,781 --> 02:05:36,501
go to utk,
download it and start building 

3361
02:05:36,501 --> 02:05:38,241
something,
figure out what you're good at and work 

3362
02:05:38,241 --> 02:05:38,241
your ass off and be better than 
everybody else.

3363
02:05:38,241 --> 02:05:39,380
I've been playing that hard shaft.
I mean

3364
02:05:39,730 --> 02:05:44,730
mineshaft game that's on the slip there.
Brian king called big black dog,

3365
02:05:48,790 --> 02:05:50,800
king kong and it was great.
It's minecraft,

3366
02:05:50,801 --> 02:05:51,600
right?
Uh,

3367
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:57,000
so have you been playing that at all?
I heard they think it's the first pc 

3368
02:05:57,000 --> 02:05:57,000
game I paid money for and years.
Really?

3369
02:05:57,000 --> 02:06:00,740
All right.
So we got through this whole episode 

3370
02:06:00,740 --> 02:06:03,031
without anybody talking about big bucks.
That was a horrible slip.

3371
02:06:03,240 --> 02:06:06,190
It was like one of those big black dicks
though.

3372
02:06:06,191 --> 02:06:09,940
It's almost like it's impossible.
It's like it's embedded into our system.

3373
02:06:10,330 --> 02:06:15,330
We track dick talk,
we've through the black car and so mine 

3374
02:06:16,291 --> 02:06:16,930
shaft,
how do I.

3375
02:06:16,960 --> 02:06:21,960
Okay,
I'm going to go from people at cox to 

3376
02:06:21,960 --> 02:06:21,960
minecraft,
minecraft game.

3377
02:06:21,960 --> 02:06:22,520
joe,
this kid,

3378
02:06:22,530 --> 02:06:27,530
this kid,
this kid decided to make this game out 

3379
02:06:27,530 --> 02:06:27,530
of it,
out of

3380
02:06:27,530 --> 02:06:28,550
his garage.
And he's making god I hipaa,

3381
02:06:28,610 --> 02:06:30,620
I don't even know the numbers.
He's making money hand over fist,

3382
02:06:30,640 --> 02:06:35,640
right?
And it's basically a world where you 

3383
02:06:35,640 --> 02:06:35,640
can,
you,

3384
02:06:35,640 --> 02:06:35,640
you initially start off and you can 
build cubes at different,

3385
02:06:35,640 --> 02:06:38,450
uh,
materials in front of you and then build

3386
02:06:38,451 --> 02:06:43,451
anything you want basically.
So imagine building three d pixels and 

3387
02:06:43,451 --> 02:06:43,451
there's people who have built like the 
earth in this game,

3388
02:06:43,451 --> 02:06:43,580
right?
Right.

3389
02:06:43,850 --> 02:06:48,850
And then there's this mode where the 
nighttime comes and you have to 

3390
02:06:48,850 --> 02:06:49,050
eventually figure out how to survive 
your first night and start building like

3391
02:06:49,100 --> 02:06:50,930
a workbench and built all these 
different things.

3392
02:06:50,931 --> 02:06:53,570
And it starts getting deeper and deeper.
I haven't gotten too deep into it,

3393
02:06:53,571 --> 02:06:58,571
but it's become this kind of phenomenon.
He's talking to valve about doing 

3394
02:06:58,571 --> 02:07:00,881
something with it and what you see right
now is these kind of little micro 

3395
02:07:00,881 --> 02:07:00,881
developers who are having success.

3396
02:07:00,881 --> 02:07:02,450
Right.
The guy who did brave jonathan blow,

3397
02:07:02,451 --> 02:07:07,451
you have the team who made portal was 
like a handful of kids who made an 

3398
02:07:07,451 --> 02:07:08,210
independent game that then they started 
working with valve.

3399
02:07:08,211 --> 02:07:09,530
Right.
The guy who did the limbo,

3400
02:07:09,531 --> 02:07:14,531
the team into the limbo.
They were at the independent games 

3401
02:07:14,531 --> 02:07:14,531
festival.
We saw that and were like,

3402
02:07:14,531 --> 02:07:17,471
this game is great,
and then every time I'd love supporting 

3403
02:07:17,471 --> 02:07:19,961
these indie kids because you never know 
like what's going to come out of them 

3404
02:07:19,961 --> 02:07:21,520
because they can often take risks that 
we can't because you know,

3405
02:07:21,530 --> 02:07:22,940
in their garage and they're,
you know,

3406
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:28,000
bill,
would it be for someone to make a movie 

3407
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:28,000
with your game engine?
Pretty easy.

3408
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:28,000
Real,
yeah.

3409
02:07:28,210 --> 02:07:29,150
Wow.
Yeah.

3410
02:07:29,960 --> 02:07:31,480
They call it machinima.
Oh yeah.

3411
02:07:31,650 --> 02:07:36,650
Mastermind.
I'm going to the award ceremony where 

3412
02:07:36,650 --> 02:07:36,650
they call it spelled.
I always call it

3413
02:07:36,650 --> 02:07:39,100
[inaudible],
but I don't know the art of,

3414
02:07:39,130 --> 02:07:39,900
of readmission.
Machinima.

3415
02:07:40,270 --> 02:07:41,710
It's the art of a virtual camera,
right?

3416
02:07:41,711 --> 02:07:43,030
That's a c,
h I,

3417
02:07:46,270 --> 02:07:47,750
m a s,
s,

3418
02:07:48,420 --> 02:07:49,900
s,
l I t dot.

3419
02:07:50,440 --> 02:07:53,890
I've seen some old ones done with old 
game engines that looked really hokey.

3420
02:07:53,920 --> 02:07:55,480
That was good,
but the game engines of today,

3421
02:07:55,481 --> 02:07:57,610
they're so sophisticated.
That was what red vs blue was,

3422
02:07:57,611 --> 02:08:02,611
right?
That was that whole web series that 

3423
02:08:02,611 --> 02:08:02,611
became huge.
These guys,

3424
02:08:02,611 --> 02:08:05,430
little characters and they just made 
them target these incredibly funny 

3425
02:08:05,430 --> 02:08:07,580
situations.
You need to have a sitcom of your 

3426
02:08:07,580 --> 02:08:07,580
character's having wives and stuff in 
that forum.

3427
02:08:07,580 --> 02:08:09,070
We will absolutely do that in our spare 
time.

3428
02:08:09,330 --> 02:08:09,840
No,
no.

3429
02:08:10,260 --> 02:08:15,260
He just hired two speed iphone efforts 
and high school kids to do it.

3430
02:08:15,571 --> 02:08:20,571
Yeah,
but the marine guys pulling their 

3431
02:08:20,571 --> 02:08:24,610
assholes apart and the goats,
he posed no beauty of so many of those 

3432
02:08:24,791 --> 02:08:25,240
internet memes.

3433
02:08:25,240 --> 02:08:27,130
Just I could sit there eating a giant 
bowl of cereal,

3434
02:08:27,131 --> 02:08:29,950
just watch it and not even care because 
it's been sent to you so many times.

3435
02:08:29,970 --> 02:08:31,630
Right.
That's true,

3436
02:08:31,930 --> 02:08:32,870
and that's the other thing.
You know,

3437
02:08:32,890 --> 02:08:37,890
we were talking about kids getting 
freaked out by all the input that they 

3438
02:08:37,890 --> 02:08:39,280
have today.
They're just going to get desensitized a

3439
02:08:39,281 --> 02:08:41,170
little quicker than us.
If you can handle it,

3440
02:08:41,180 --> 02:08:43,300
the kids can handle it.
Just gonna be trickier,

3441
02:08:43,910 --> 02:08:48,910
trickier in the beginning.
But I will tell you bringing it full 

3442
02:08:48,910 --> 02:08:48,910
circle,
like every time I see real life,

3443
02:08:48,910 --> 02:08:48,910
like,
you know,

3444
02:08:48,910 --> 02:08:50,200
violence in front of you see somebody 
get hit at a bar.

3445
02:08:50,220 --> 02:08:53,890
It makes me nauseous.
My problem is I'm so used to it.

3446
02:08:54,310 --> 02:08:56,050
I see people get beat up and it's so 
normal.

3447
02:08:56,590 --> 02:09:00,610
My wife cut her head and she opened up 
the back of her car,

3448
02:09:00,650 --> 02:09:02,500
you know,
the hood and banged her head on it.

3449
02:09:02,500 --> 02:09:05,000
She accidentally the skull but bled.
No,

3450
02:09:05,050 --> 02:09:06,790
it wasn't that bad,
but it started bleeding because I talked

3451
02:09:06,791 --> 02:09:07,710
about this already.
No,

3452
02:09:07,780 --> 02:09:11,950
it started bleeding and um,
I just looked at a cut for her.

3453
02:09:11,951 --> 02:09:13,960
I was like this traumatic thing and I'm 
like,

3454
02:09:13,961 --> 02:09:17,020
they're not even gonna stop this fight.
This is nothing to tap on this.

3455
02:09:17,160 --> 02:09:18,840
This is ridiculous.
This is barely cut.

3456
02:09:18,910 --> 02:09:21,850
Like there's only one inpatient wounds 
bleed a lot and I'm like thinking shit,

3457
02:09:21,851 --> 02:09:23,770
I might have to take her to the hospital
for this little baby cut.

3458
02:09:23,800 --> 02:09:28,800
And she's gonna freak out if she gonna 
let me stick like crazy glue in there 

3459
02:09:28,800 --> 02:09:28,800
and glue it together because that's what
I would do.

3460
02:09:28,800 --> 02:09:29,380
Those my head.
I'd be like,

3461
02:09:29,381 --> 02:09:32,960
just drop some crazy shit,
man.

3462
02:09:33,070 --> 02:09:35,350
Crying you.
Pansy cuts when you get cut,

3463
02:09:35,410 --> 02:09:40,410
they put crazy glue on it and push it 
together with the little one gets put 

3464
02:09:40,410 --> 02:09:40,410
some vinegar on.

3465
02:09:40,410 --> 02:09:45,180
My point is I'm so used to trauma,
I'm so used to like dudes getting 

3466
02:09:45,180 --> 02:09:46,540
punched in the face and you have that 
kind of fighting,

3467
02:09:46,720 --> 02:09:51,720
bringing constantly do.
And again it comes back to boston once 

3468
02:09:51,720 --> 02:09:52,030
there's that,
but there's also working for the ufc for

3469
02:09:52,031 --> 02:09:55,600
over a thousand fights being three feet 
away from these murderers,

3470
02:09:55,810 --> 02:09:58,720
these fucking trained killers punting 
each other in their head.

3471
02:09:58,990 --> 02:10:01,480
You know what I mean?
I've seen so many dudes just get fucking

3472
02:10:01,550 --> 02:10:02,470
flatlined.
What's,

3473
02:10:02,490 --> 02:10:07,490
what's.
What's the lifespan of a fighter with 

3474
02:10:07,490 --> 02:10:07,490
the amount of head damage?
Everything,

3475
02:10:07,490 --> 02:10:07,490
right?
It's a good question.

3476
02:10:07,490 --> 02:10:08,430
I don't think we know.
I'm not saying lifespan.

3477
02:10:08,440 --> 02:10:13,440
I'm saying as far as like how long can 
you actually fight before it starts to 

3478
02:10:13,440 --> 02:10:13,440
come in?
Have you seen,

3479
02:10:13,440 --> 02:10:13,810
have you seen that it becomes like a 
visible issue,

3480
02:10:13,811 --> 02:10:15,460
like you start to see things get a 
little off?

3481
02:10:15,520 --> 02:10:20,520
I have seen guys go from being 
absolutely normal to absolutely not 

3482
02:10:20,520 --> 02:10:21,340
normal,
absolutely normal to frightening.

3483
02:10:21,370 --> 02:10:23,260
I've seen that.
I've seen the full spectrum.

3484
02:10:23,370 --> 02:10:28,370
That's very shocking and I've seen also 
also guys like randy coture who get out 

3485
02:10:28,370 --> 02:10:29,620
of it with not a,
not a single problem,

3486
02:10:29,920 --> 02:10:33,290
you know,
and randy is so super lucid,

3487
02:10:33,320 --> 02:10:34,010
you know,
you talked to

3488
02:10:34,010 --> 02:10:35,060
him,
he's very intelligent,

3489
02:10:35,061 --> 02:10:37,160
very aware and you know,
and he's been,

3490
02:10:37,190 --> 02:10:42,190
he's been knocked out a couple of times.
He's recognized how to build the brand 

3491
02:10:42,190 --> 02:10:42,190
though,
right?

3492
02:10:42,190 --> 02:10:42,710
Well it's also,
he's a smart guy.

3493
02:10:42,711 --> 02:10:44,780
He doesn't take unnecessary punishment.
Some guys,

3494
02:10:44,990 --> 02:10:47,810
they try to be more exciting so they'll 
take unnecessary punishment.

3495
02:10:47,811 --> 02:10:48,380
They'll,
they'll,

3496
02:10:48,770 --> 02:10:53,770
they won't fight strategically.
They'll fight like in an aggressive 

3497
02:10:53,770 --> 02:10:55,310
style and an attempt to overwhelm this 
person with their physicality.

3498
02:10:55,580 --> 02:10:56,690
And when you do that,
you know,

3499
02:10:56,691 --> 02:10:58,520
it makes for an exciting fight for the 
fans,

3500
02:10:58,820 --> 02:11:03,820
but it's very dangerous for you.
It's very danger for your long term 

3501
02:11:03,820 --> 02:11:04,470
mental health.
That's a management issue.

3502
02:11:04,590 --> 02:11:09,590
You'd assume that demIng fighters have 
their managers who kind of advise them 

3503
02:11:09,590 --> 02:11:09,590
on these impossible.
You can't tell a guy what to do.

3504
02:11:09,680 --> 02:11:11,630
There's no way he's going to not going 
to listen to you.

3505
02:11:11,631 --> 02:11:11,870
If he's.

3506
02:11:11,870 --> 02:11:16,870
The guy wears his underwear when he gets
in that fucking cage and they shut that 

3507
02:11:16,870 --> 02:11:16,870
door.
He's not gonna.

3508
02:11:16,870 --> 02:11:16,870
Listen,
yeah.

3509
02:11:16,870 --> 02:11:21,140
Fighters will take.
They'll take direction as far as 

3510
02:11:21,140 --> 02:11:23,681
coaching.
They'll take direction as far as 

3511
02:11:23,681 --> 02:11:23,681
technique.
They'll take direction as far as,

3512
02:11:23,681 --> 02:11:27,401
you know,
they have a guy that they really trust 

3513
02:11:27,401 --> 02:11:27,401
and he raises them correctly and trains 
have to be a good fighter.

3514
02:11:27,401 --> 02:11:31,270
They'll go out there with a healthy 
respect for the art form and they'll go 

3515
02:11:31,270 --> 02:11:31,710
out there and do it right.
But if you get a guy and he just.

3516
02:11:31,730 --> 02:11:34,970
That's how he developed.
He developed like this is a style,

3517
02:11:35,120 --> 02:11:37,340
and then he tried to coach him.
It's like,

3518
02:11:37,490 --> 02:11:38,450
you know,
good luck.

3519
02:11:38,590 --> 02:11:43,590
The new tricks that will you mean.
So to see some fighters and all they 

3520
02:11:43,590 --> 02:11:46,421
want to do is brawl and they brought 
every fight and then you see other 

3521
02:11:46,421 --> 02:11:46,421
fighters were.

3522
02:11:46,421 --> 02:11:47,180
They skillfully avoid strikes.
Take the guy down,

3523
02:11:47,181 --> 02:11:48,680
strangle them.
You never see.

3524
02:11:48,800 --> 02:11:51,200
Very rarely I should say.
I wouldn't say never.

3525
02:11:51,380 --> 02:11:53,750
He never.
He very rarely see someone go from being

3526
02:11:53,751 --> 02:11:56,840
the meathead brawler to being the super 
intelligent,

3527
02:11:56,960 --> 02:11:59,980
ultra skilled technician to get through 
a fight and takes no damn.

3528
02:12:00,140 --> 02:12:01,430
Imagine you want to be surgical about 
it,

3529
02:12:01,431 --> 02:12:02,480
right?
You should.

3530
02:12:02,481 --> 02:12:07,481
Yeah.
Well you should treat it like what it 

3531
02:12:07,481 --> 02:12:09,701
is.
It's a martial art and it's a game and 

3532
02:12:09,701 --> 02:12:09,730
the game is due punishment without 
getting punishment done to you.

3533
02:12:09,770 --> 02:12:12,080
Be superIor in every single aspect of 
the game.

3534
02:12:12,320 --> 02:12:14,780
Be able to force your will on that 
person.

3535
02:12:14,900 --> 02:12:16,940
Yeah.
That's the intelligent part about it.

3536
02:12:17,150 --> 02:12:17,970
But you know,
you know,

3537
02:12:18,070 --> 02:12:20,600
it's also when you get fight of the 
night bonuses and you know,

3538
02:12:20,601 --> 02:12:23,600
you want to make the crowd cheer and you
know and get that adrenaline.

3539
02:12:23,630 --> 02:12:24,230
Yeah.
Yeah.

3540
02:12:24,231 --> 02:12:25,170
And a lot of guys,
you know,

3541
02:12:25,220 --> 02:12:27,920
they love to say they finished fights,
they go out there and they put it on the

3542
02:12:27,921 --> 02:12:29,780
line and it does make for more exciting 
fight.

3543
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:31,580
That's,
that's absolutely true.

3544
02:12:31,970 --> 02:12:35,780
But I had this exact conversation with a
guy named john donner,

3545
02:12:35,910 --> 02:12:38,870
who's is a pretty infamous jujitsu 
instructor,

3546
02:12:38,990 --> 02:12:40,550
really super,
super smart guy,

3547
02:12:40,850 --> 02:12:44,360
and he and I both agreed that the most 
important thing is,

3548
02:12:44,510 --> 02:12:46,730
even though it's good to be exciting as 
a fighter,

3549
02:12:46,731 --> 02:12:47,870
it's good to,
you know,

3550
02:12:48,140 --> 02:12:53,140
it's good to please the crowd and it 
makes the sport more popular and 

3551
02:12:53,140 --> 02:12:53,450
everything.
I absolutely agree with that too,

3552
02:12:53,451 --> 02:12:58,451
but the most important thing is to be 
very skilled and to be the most skilled 

3553
02:12:58,701 --> 02:13:03,701
and do the exact right thing that you're
supposed to be doing in order to apply 

3554
02:13:03,701 --> 02:13:04,730
damage,
but take little return.

3555
02:13:04,850 --> 02:13:09,260
And when you take unnecessary risks and 
you do something in an unsmart manner,

3556
02:13:09,470 --> 02:13:11,030
you're degrading your art.

3557
02:13:11,230 --> 02:13:11,800
You're,
you're,

3558
02:13:11,801 --> 02:13:14,060
you're watering down your purpose.
You're,

3559
02:13:14,061 --> 02:13:19,061
you're,
you're doing something that's not the 

3560
02:13:19,061 --> 02:13:19,061
optimal way to do it.
It's not the artistic way to do it.

3561
02:13:19,061 --> 02:13:20,930
You're not,
you're not fighting it correctly.

3562
02:13:20,990 --> 02:13:22,280
You know,
it's like riding a wave,

3563
02:13:22,310 --> 02:13:23,390
you know,
when you get off that way,

3564
02:13:23,391 --> 02:13:25,160
what do you want to do?
You want to face plant into the rocks.

3565
02:13:25,161 --> 02:13:26,270
Of course not.
No,

3566
02:13:26,271 --> 02:13:31,271
you want to,
you want to ride that bitch and be 

3567
02:13:31,271 --> 02:13:31,271
perfect.
That's the way that I can't.

3568
02:13:31,271 --> 02:13:31,271
I can't speak on them.
And it's just,

3569
02:13:31,271 --> 02:13:32,220
it's a world that said so

3570
02:13:32,300 --> 02:13:33,080
alien.
Yeah.

3571
02:13:33,090 --> 02:13:35,430
I would say it's alien to me and I've 
done martial arts my whole life,

3572
02:13:35,431 --> 02:13:37,380
but I've never fought in the ufc,
you know,

3573
02:13:37,381 --> 02:13:40,140
and being around over at least a 
thousand fights,

3574
02:13:40,141 --> 02:13:40,890
you know?
Yeah.

3575
02:13:41,100 --> 02:13:44,730
But we were talking about like guys like
being used to trauma.

3576
02:13:44,731 --> 02:13:47,850
I'm way too used to trauma.
So normal for me.

3577
02:13:47,860 --> 02:13:50,240
I've been at bars with dudes are beating
the fuck out of each other.

3578
02:13:50,260 --> 02:13:50,780
I'm like,
yeah,

3579
02:13:50,850 --> 02:13:53,160
these guys hit each other.
Keep your hands up,

3580
02:13:53,230 --> 02:13:54,900
dude.
A fucking pussy.

3581
02:13:54,990 --> 02:13:55,860
That's the irony,
right?

3582
02:13:55,861 --> 02:13:56,320
Is like,
you know,

3583
02:13:56,340 --> 02:14:01,340
when we do these games these days for 
your pet as guys and they just need a 

3584
02:14:01,340 --> 02:14:04,491
terrine arms off beat people to death of
it and like you see anything in real 

3585
02:14:04,491 --> 02:14:04,491
life and it's just like,
jesus,

3586
02:14:04,491 --> 02:14:05,670
I get seven getting sick.
Right.

3587
02:14:05,870 --> 02:14:07,400
Well that's a good question man.
So like,

3588
02:14:07,590 --> 02:14:09,510
what do you think about this whole 
debate that,

3589
02:14:09,540 --> 02:14:10,120
you know,
this,

3590
02:14:10,121 --> 02:14:15,121
this,
I think it's pretty silly and kind of 

3591
02:14:15,121 --> 02:14:16,260
like not,
not well thought out,

3592
02:14:16,470 --> 02:14:18,750
this idea that violent games make people
violent.

3593
02:14:19,020 --> 02:14:23,220
I don't think that's true.
I think whatever happened to crazy first

3594
02:14:23,221 --> 02:14:24,120
and foremost,
right?

3595
02:14:24,150 --> 02:14:25,650
It's a chris rock's kind of think about 
it.

3596
02:14:25,990 --> 02:14:28,470
I honestly think it's a situation that 
they,

3597
02:14:28,490 --> 02:14:30,270
they relieve more stress than they 
cause.

3598
02:14:30,900 --> 02:14:35,900
LIke it's a cathartic thing.
Like if there's a certain type of mind 

3599
02:14:35,900 --> 02:14:39,941
that's drawn to a certain type of 
entertainment that was just predisposed 

3600
02:14:39,941 --> 02:14:39,941
to that,
right?

3601
02:14:39,941 --> 02:14:39,941
Yeah.
And that person's sick period.

3602
02:14:39,941 --> 02:14:44,930
Yeah.
So you're not going to get violent 

3603
02:14:44,930 --> 02:14:44,930
games.
Was hitler playing?

3604
02:14:44,930 --> 02:14:44,930
Right,
that kind of thing.

3605
02:14:44,930 --> 02:14:45,390
Right.
And it's just like,

3606
02:14:45,391 --> 02:14:46,620
dude,
I mean,

3607
02:14:47,280 --> 02:14:52,280
right.
We cannot create a society based upon 

3608
02:14:52,280 --> 02:14:52,280
the lowest common denominator of 
entertainment.

3609
02:14:52,280 --> 02:14:54,140
Thank you.
Write like a or anything or anything.

3610
02:14:54,260 --> 02:14:55,860
There's,
there's entertainment for kids,

3611
02:14:55,861 --> 02:14:58,980
it's entertainment for adults and that's
the way the world works.

3612
02:14:58,981 --> 02:15:00,450
I mean it should be that way with 
everything.

3613
02:15:00,451 --> 02:15:01,950
Access to information,
you know,

3614
02:15:01,951 --> 02:15:06,951
propaganda you can't,
you can't like program society for the 

3615
02:15:06,951 --> 02:15:07,020
lowest common denominator.

3616
02:15:07,370 --> 02:15:08,160
What you're doing,
if you're,

3617
02:15:08,161 --> 02:15:10,350
if you're not allowing intelligent 
people,

3618
02:15:10,351 --> 02:15:15,351
we're not going to be effective if 
you're trying to restrict their access 

3619
02:15:15,351 --> 02:15:17,961
to things like video games and I 
personally think the market will bear 

3620
02:15:17,961 --> 02:15:17,961
what the market will bear,
right?

3621
02:15:17,961 --> 02:15:22,650
Like you look at what we do with a 
styliZed violence of these big giant 

3622
02:15:22,650 --> 02:15:23,070
guys and space armor.
Ripping the arms of lizard men.

3623
02:15:23,490 --> 02:15:28,490
If there's a game about a guy on 
flatbush avenue with the yankees hat 

3624
02:15:28,490 --> 02:15:30,900
pulling off the arm of somebody else 
with the red sox hat and it was depicted

3625
02:15:30,901 --> 02:15:31,860
real lake,
it be kind of like,

3626
02:15:31,890 --> 02:15:36,890
eh,
but then the violence in grand theft 

3627
02:15:36,890 --> 02:15:39,051
auto on the other hand plays very well 
because it's done within the context of 

3628
02:15:39,051 --> 02:15:42,171
the story or it's done comedically where
you're running over a hooker or 

3629
02:15:42,171 --> 02:15:42,171
something like that.
Right?

3630
02:15:42,171 --> 02:15:44,530
It's all people.
If people are willing to say that,

3631
02:15:44,840 --> 02:15:45,480
okay,
but,

3632
02:15:45,720 --> 02:15:47,670
but what if the government steps in?

3633
02:15:47,670 --> 02:15:52,670
I mean,
there's been many times where there's 

3634
02:15:52,670 --> 02:15:54,321
been talk about legislating what the 
content of video games and making sure 

3635
02:15:54,321 --> 02:15:56,430
that there's rules what you can and 
can't do.

3636
02:15:56,460 --> 02:15:57,990
They're already rose though.
That's the thIng.

3637
02:15:57,991 --> 02:16:00,520
that's what people forget is the fact 
that this rating,

3638
02:16:00,530 --> 02:16:05,530
so if there's a rating system,
there's a parental restrictions on the 

3639
02:16:05,530 --> 02:16:08,031
consoles which are very easy to set and 
there's also the fact that the games 

3640
02:16:08,031 --> 02:16:09,270
costs a certain amount of money in order
to get access to.

3641
02:16:09,450 --> 02:16:12,950
There's multiple gateways there that are
in place and on top of all of that there

3642
02:16:12,951 --> 02:16:15,630
is of course the parenting issue,
but is there the situation like there is

3643
02:16:15,631 --> 02:16:17,100
with movies where they tell you,
hey,

3644
02:16:17,101 --> 02:16:22,101
you can't release this unless you cut 
out a bunch of shit or it's going to be 

3645
02:16:22,101 --> 02:16:22,980
like x ray.
It is reviewed,

3646
02:16:23,130 --> 02:16:28,130
right?
It is viewed videos nc 17 or something 

3647
02:16:28,130 --> 02:16:29,010
that you can get an adults only rating,
but it's the.

3648
02:16:29,350 --> 02:16:30,070
It's a kiss of death

3649
02:16:30,070 --> 02:16:35,070
much like the nc 17.
Whereas you know you're not going to be 

3650
02:16:35,070 --> 02:16:35,070
in walmart.
You're going to.

3651
02:16:35,070 --> 02:16:37,711
You're not going to be in mass effect.
Isn't that at walmart mass effect or 

3652
02:16:37,711 --> 02:16:38,210
whatever?
The one with the prostitution,

3653
02:16:38,280 --> 02:16:43,040
the add and that was massive effect.
Did have some sex type question it,

3654
02:16:43,050 --> 02:16:44,040
but there was,
I don't know about.

3655
02:16:44,140 --> 02:16:49,140
I don't think it was prostitution in any
mention of amazing that you can have 

3656
02:16:49,140 --> 02:16:51,010
chain saws and the end of your gun where
you can cut people in half,

3657
02:16:51,011 --> 02:16:53,110
but you can't fuck.
Well,

3658
02:16:53,111 --> 02:16:54,700
that's America.

3659
02:19:45,940 --> 02:19:50,940
okay.
Okay.

3660
02:19:54,050 --> 02:19:57,400
Okay.
I think or something like that.

3661
02:19:59,400 --> 02:20:00,160
Alright.
Alright,

3662
02:20:00,180 --> 02:20:01,920

Anyway,

3663
02:20:02,130 --> 02:20:04,140
it's rough being this cat.
we're going to have to split this up.

3664
02:20:04,230 --> 02:20:09,230
This audio is split up.
I'll put it together at the end to ask 

3665
02:20:09,230 --> 02:20:09,230
her.
you know what the fuck you're doing.

3666
02:20:09,230 --> 02:20:10,110
This is the end.

3670
02:20:16,681 --> 02:20:18,570
It was a lot of fun.
Like I was saying before we cut off,

3671
02:20:18,770 --> 02:20:19,740
uh,

3672
02:20:19,741 --> 02:20:21,000
man.
We covered the universe.

3673
02:20:21,001 --> 02:20:23,910

The universe.
The galaxy fighting.

3679
02:20:33,300 --> 02:20:38,300
Bleeding technology with glue and dude 
come to town once more than once every 

3680
02:20:38,371 --> 02:20:43,371
five years.
It's tough to get to raleigh and 

3681
02:20:43,371 --> 02:20:43,371
charlotte.
Even charlotte.

3682
02:20:43,490 --> 02:20:48,490
Yeah.
Well maybe I'll do charlie goodnight's 

3683
02:20:48,490 --> 02:20:48,490

3684
02:20:48,490 --> 02:20:48,490
I haven't done that time.
It wasn't.

3685
02:20:48,490 --> 02:20:48,780
Yeah,
but you know what?

3686
02:20:48,781 --> 02:20:50,370
The problem is too many.
God damn hecklers.

3687
02:20:50,550 --> 02:20:52,970
That's why I stopped going there.
There's too many really.

3688
02:20:53,190 --> 02:20:55,020
You can always tell him.
Dude.

3689
02:20:55,021 --> 02:20:56,460
It was brutal.
The last time was there.

3690
02:20:56,461 --> 02:20:59,340
It was just people talking shows.
I'm not.

3691
02:20:59,370 --> 02:21:01,530
I mean this is a fun club though.
Great owners too.

3692
02:21:01,940 --> 02:21:02,960
Anyway,
ladies and gentlemen,

3693
02:21:02,961 --> 02:21:04,160
that's it.
Thank you very much.

3694
02:21:04,161 --> 02:21:05,180
Cliff.
He beach like.

3695
02:21:05,390 --> 02:21:06,020
Yes,
thank you.

3696
02:21:06,021 --> 02:21:07,850
Thank you to the fleshlight for 
sponsoring the show.

3697
02:21:07,851 --> 02:21:11,540
You can go to [inaudible] dot com and if
you go to joe rogan.net,

3698
02:21:11,570 --> 02:21:13,640
there's a link that takes it a 
fleshlight.com

3699
02:21:13,641 --> 02:21:18,641
and you type in the keyword rogan the 
promo code and you get 15 percent off 

3700
02:21:18,641 --> 02:21:21,290
and then you'd get beat off like a 
fucking savage,

3701
02:21:21,590 --> 02:21:26,590
like a man alone in the ocean trying to 
figure out how to get by on cans and 

3702
02:21:28,360 --> 02:21:31,190
dried fish and some rainwater that 
you've collected.

3703
02:21:31,680 --> 02:21:36,680
Fleshlight get enough spit and you're 
hallucinating because your fucking skin 

3704
02:21:36,681 --> 02:21:39,950
is getting cooked off by the son.
You ain't got no sunscreen stupid.

3705
02:21:40,040 --> 02:21:41,690
Your dog is just walking all over the 
minimum.

3706
02:21:41,700 --> 02:21:43,760
So rude.
That's the end of the show.

3707
02:21:43,761 --> 02:21:45,200
Ladies and gentlemen,
