1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:02,850
Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:05,640
You wanted to be the head
of police of Chicago,

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:06,990
is that still going on?

4
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:07,801
No,

5
00:00:07,801 --> 00:00:09,180
I mean they certainly,

6
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:09,570
uh,

7
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:13,290
the corruption went in and so we
can tell that story real quick.

8
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:15,930
What they did is they
did a national search,

9
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:19,290
so the laws in Chicago said that this,

10
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:19,570
uh,

11
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:24,570
appointed police board has to do a
nationwide search and then they give three

12
00:00:25,261 --> 00:00:26,370
names to the mayor.

13
00:00:26,371 --> 00:00:30,180
The mayor investigates those
people and then chooses one.

14
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:33,210
So I predicted they weren't
going to go with me.

15
00:00:33,211 --> 00:00:38,211
I'm too far ahead still that no one's
really ready to take that bite yet,

16
00:00:38,521 --> 00:00:41,040
but it's still something we could have
talked about and they would have had the

17
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:41,874
opportunity.

18
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:43,880
I figured they would pick that,

19
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:44,290
uh,

20
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:49,290
that I figured they'd pick a black guy
who was educated and not from Chicago.

21
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:50,200
Uh,

22
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:54,330
that was my prediction and that's
who the police board did choose.

23
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:59,330
They chose a guy from Atlanta
who fit that bill to the t.

24
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:00,570
He was going to be

25
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:07,550
the black guy that represents the police
department but still totes their line.

26
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:08,060
Um,

27
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:11,220
I'm thinking of a word that everybody
knows and I'm not saying it so you can all

28
00:01:11,221 --> 00:01:12,330
pick up on what I'm suggesting.

29
00:01:12,331 --> 00:01:13,150
You're saying uncle Tom.

30
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:13,790
Yeah.

31
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:14,490
And,

32
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:16,830
and let people have an uncle
Tom and he's a nice guy.

33
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:18,840
So if you have an uncle
and his name is Tom,

34
00:01:18,841 --> 00:01:19,500
don't worry about it.

35
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:20,790
So that's what they're going to look for.

36
00:01:20,791 --> 00:01:25,530
Something that will have
visually a seems satisfying.

37
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:26,310
I see.

38
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:28,530
Good instructionally be exactly the same.

39
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:34,590
So they chose that guy and
the mayor are still said,

40
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:35,540
yeah,

41
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:38,100
I don't know what that guy I want you
was this guy that didn't even apply.

42
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:39,720
And that skews the commissioner.

43
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:44,220
So who is this guy that didn't
imply he was couple ranks down.

44
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:47,010
I'm already in the agency.

45
00:01:47,011 --> 00:01:48,510
He is a,

46
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:53,160
he said that he has never seen misconduct
or corruption in the Chicago Police

47
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,840
Department and his entire
20 something year career,

48
00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:00,950
he is intimately tied into a cheating
scandal and the promotional tests.

49
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,740
Another thing which
you could solve easily.

50
00:02:04,741 --> 00:02:09,741
So his friends like wife or
something got number one,

51
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:11,070
the lieutenant's test,

52
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:15,060
which is extremely a qualifying.

53
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:15,923
So say.

54
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:21,260
And as soon as the information comes down
that he actually was the one that was

55
00:02:23,281 --> 00:02:24,410
developing the tests,

56
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:25,560
had the answers,

57
00:02:25,561 --> 00:02:28,380
and then she gets this super
high score out of nowhere.

58
00:02:28,381 --> 00:02:28,831
And you know,

59
00:02:28,831 --> 00:02:29,641
as when everybody says,

60
00:02:29,641 --> 00:02:29,761
oh,

61
00:02:29,761 --> 00:02:30,121
come on,

62
00:02:30,121 --> 00:02:31,020
we've seen this before,

63
00:02:31,021 --> 00:02:31,854
we know what it is,

64
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:32,941
so you can solve it,

65
00:02:32,941 --> 00:02:33,810
you could retest them.

66
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:34,420
Right.

67
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:35,191
And see who does it.

68
00:02:35,191 --> 00:02:36,420
But at first of course not.

69
00:02:36,421 --> 00:02:37,120
So they're not going to do that.

70
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,230
Did they have any interest
in exposing things?

71
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:40,980
So if I'm going to come in
there and I'm going to say,

72
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:41,731
all right,

73
00:02:41,731 --> 00:02:42,031
that's it.

74
00:02:42,031 --> 00:02:43,050
We're going to be transparent,

75
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:44,911
I don't think there.

76
00:02:44,911 --> 00:02:45,181
Okay.

77
00:02:45,181 --> 00:02:48,090
So now when you say that you
were a little too far ahead,

78
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:49,410
what do you mean by that?

79
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:50,371
Well,

80
00:02:50,371 --> 00:02:55,371
it seems the people of a city or of any
area have to be pushed hard enough to,

81
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:00,490
to have that change.

82
00:03:00,491 --> 00:03:03,940
Like they have to have that breaking
point where they say that's it.

83
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,560
We're going to do something different.

84
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:09,730
Because what I really push is
for civilian controlled policing.

85
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:12,190
I want you guys to tell me what,

86
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,113
what should be done,

87
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:15,040
which is a huge drop in power,

88
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:15,640
so that's,

89
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:18,730
that would require a mayor that's willing
to give in to the people that have

90
00:03:18,731 --> 00:03:20,290
pushed hard enough to say,

91
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:20,620
look,

92
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:25,620
I'm going to relinquish control of my
essential armed wing and I'm going to give

93
00:03:25,661 --> 00:03:26,800
it to the people,

94
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:30,280
and so what's been done before?

95
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:31,210
Not that I'm aware of,

96
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:31,961
not in America.

97
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:32,561
It certainly hasn't.

98
00:03:32,561 --> 00:03:34,660
So who's going to be the
city that takes that leap?

99
00:03:34,661 --> 00:03:35,494
It has to come.

100
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:36,161
It has to.

101
00:03:36,161 --> 00:03:36,994
We all know it.

102
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:40,270
One of the things that I've been
ranting about a lot lately is choice.

103
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:40,601
You know,

104
00:03:40,601 --> 00:03:41,434
and people this.

105
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:45,280
We live in a society that loves
to take choice from us and say,

106
00:03:45,281 --> 00:03:45,581
all right,

107
00:03:45,581 --> 00:03:46,900
everything is a disease.

108
00:03:46,901 --> 00:03:48,070
Everything is privilege.

109
00:03:48,071 --> 00:03:49,330
Everything is this thing.

110
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,050
You know,

111
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:53,770
you really didn't have a choice because
there were these preconceived conditions

112
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:57,000
and and it really is robbing
us of choice because with,

113
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,280
if we accept our inherent superpower,

114
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:00,101
which is choice,

115
00:04:00,101 --> 00:04:03,760
then we have responsibility for who we
are and if we have responsibility for who

116
00:04:03,761 --> 00:04:04,390
we are,

117
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:08,680
all of us have such a harsh self
judge that every failing we have,

118
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:09,311
if we say,

119
00:04:09,311 --> 00:04:09,581
well,

120
00:04:09,581 --> 00:04:10,414
it was up to us,

121
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:12,760
the judge just beats us to death about it.

122
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:16,840
So we'd rather shrug our responsibility
and go with our hands up to the judge.

123
00:04:16,841 --> 00:04:17,111
Judge,

124
00:04:17,111 --> 00:04:17,861
it wasn't my fault,

125
00:04:17,861 --> 00:04:22,750
it wasn't my fault because we have such
a harsh self judge in our own head that,

126
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,400
that we intend to do that.

127
00:04:24,401 --> 00:04:25,170
So we,

128
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:27,250
we give up our inherent superpower,

129
00:04:27,251 --> 00:04:30,130
which is choice because we don't
want to take the responsibility,

130
00:04:30,131 --> 00:04:33,610
but at any point we can take that back
and you have to deal with the judge and

131
00:04:33,611 --> 00:04:37,270
you deal with the judge by making
a pact to always forgive yourself.

132
00:04:37,271 --> 00:04:40,840
Forgive yourself for any of the fucked
up things that have happened and just

133
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:42,700
accept that we're all imperfect.

134
00:04:42,701 --> 00:04:45,460
This idea of perfection is nonsense.

135
00:04:45,461 --> 00:04:46,390
We're all going to fuck up.

136
00:04:46,391 --> 00:04:46,900
We're all gonna,

137
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:47,733
make mistakes,

138
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:49,080
and so the judge is,

139
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:50,470
this is nonsense.

140
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:50,771
You know,

141
00:04:50,771 --> 00:04:52,870
it's like we're all gonna
have come to the place.

142
00:04:52,871 --> 00:04:53,704
We are,

143
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:53,951
you know,

144
00:04:53,951 --> 00:04:57,880
through any variety of channels and
we're going to be an imperfect path no

145
00:04:57,881 --> 00:04:58,714
matter what.

146
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:03,720
So continued to pound that own message
of self love and forgiveness and then re

147
00:05:04,181 --> 00:05:08,860
harness that element of choice so that
we can then decide what we want to be,

148
00:05:08,861 --> 00:05:09,730
who we want to be,

149
00:05:09,731 --> 00:05:11,950
what we want to go and put our intent.

150
00:05:11,951 --> 00:05:13,030
Fourth and yeah,

151
00:05:13,031 --> 00:05:14,620
and maybe not everything is possible,

152
00:05:14,621 --> 00:05:19,621
but what better thing to do than than to
fail in the cause of your greatest wish

153
00:05:20,231 --> 00:05:22,180
and your greatest intention
in your greatest desire.

154
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:22,691
I mean,

155
00:05:22,691 --> 00:05:24,220
that's the ultimate warriors death.

156
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:28,390
That's what they would talk about with
Vala to find an enemy worthy enough to

157
00:05:28,391 --> 00:05:29,290
kill me in battle.

158
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:33,700
That was the ultimate idea and we can
all choose those battles and choose that

159
00:05:33,701 --> 00:05:35,410
thing that we're fighting for and fuck,

160
00:05:35,411 --> 00:05:35,951
if we fail,

161
00:05:35,951 --> 00:05:36,760
so what?

162
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,800
But at least if we're
going out on that way,

163
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:39,311
you know,

164
00:05:39,311 --> 00:05:41,500
we'll go out with a smile
100 percent of the time.

165
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,200
But it starts with really
harnessing that choice.

166
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:47,560
I've got a bunch of shit for
coming against the naked shows.

167
00:05:47,561 --> 00:05:48,970
They do comedy shows,

168
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:49,271
what?

169
00:05:49,271 --> 00:05:50,104
Naked shows.

170
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,600
They do these naked comedy
shows in New York sometimes.

171
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,540
So yeah,

172
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:54,730
the whole audience is naked.

173
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,450
No,

174
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:56,500
just the comics.

175
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:56,831
Oh,

176
00:05:56,831 --> 00:05:57,740
what the fuck?

177
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,000
I was doing this.

178
00:05:59,060 --> 00:05:59,571
We're doing this thing,

179
00:05:59,571 --> 00:06:04,571
this weekend's gang fest for two
days for Legion skanks and uh,

180
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:06,500
at the creek and the
cave in Long Island city.

181
00:06:06,501 --> 00:06:07,390
And we're having a,

182
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,690
a naked roast battle.

183
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:10,430
I see the novelty in it.

184
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,800
I argued with a girl comic
who's talking about like,

185
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:17,060
this is about getting
over things and you know,

186
00:06:17,061 --> 00:06:18,480
there's this artistic back to it.

187
00:06:18,481 --> 00:06:19,314
I go,

188
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:20,330
whatever you say,

189
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:21,351
I'm just telling you.

190
00:06:21,351 --> 00:06:23,360
Every guy goes there to see pussy.

191
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:26,840
And she's at her argument was just like,

192
00:06:26,841 --> 00:06:27,271
no,

193
00:06:27,271 --> 00:06:28,210
like people want to see like,

194
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:28,401
you know,

195
00:06:28,401 --> 00:06:30,350
the social experiment
of it and see what I go.

196
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:34,880
I'm going to look at policy and I'm
telling you that I am Joe average in my

197
00:06:34,881 --> 00:06:35,680
thoughts,

198
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,250
like I am common guy,

199
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:40,550
but she'll run into a guy
who argue against that,

200
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:42,740
but I don't even go
there for personalities.

201
00:06:42,741 --> 00:06:43,970
I like to hear these people talk.

202
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,080
So she came on our
podcast with a dude who.

203
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:46,360
Yeah,

204
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,390
it was the whole thing goes,

205
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:48,290
Nah man.

206
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:48,771
It's about like,

207
00:06:48,771 --> 00:06:49,310
you know,

208
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:50,470
getting over fears

209
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:51,050
copies.

210
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:51,500
I'm like,

211
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,333
dude,

212
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:56,090
you are just so excited to
be with a girl that like,

213
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:59,270
like backstage with a girl and everyone
is like sitting there with your Dick and

214
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:00,060
pussies out.

215
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:00,540
Yup.

216
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:00,960
We used,

217
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,190
me and Kurt used to do a Gig in Philly.

218
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:07,200
It was and where you could do comedy once
in a while at a burlesque place called

219
00:07:07,201 --> 00:07:10,160
the five spot or less like a date.

220
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,270
They did dancing with their clothes on,

221
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:12,870
you know,

222
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:15,170
they get down to the pastries
and everything and the,

223
00:07:15,171 --> 00:07:16,800
and the goofy outfits.

224
00:07:16,801 --> 00:07:19,710
But me and Kurt would
do this once a month.

225
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,673
We'd be like,

226
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:21,870
do comedy on that show.

227
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:23,101
In between.

228
00:07:23,101 --> 00:07:24,420
The first time we did it,

229
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:27,470
we were bags and we were
blown away because it's,

230
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:28,440
you never do it.

231
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:28,910
Well,

232
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:29,130
they go,

233
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:29,761
don't be weird.

234
00:07:29,761 --> 00:07:30,500
Backstage dogs,

235
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:30,660
you know,

236
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:34,740
what's the theater technically so the
girls are running around naked know

237
00:07:34,741 --> 00:07:37,740
they're changing so they're just naked
a lot and sometimes they would just sit

238
00:07:37,741 --> 00:07:40,380
around naked smoking
cigarettes back there,

239
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:41,723
butt naked,

240
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,230
sitting down in chairs.

241
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:45,630
Pussy all mashed up and me

242
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:50,340
and me and I shouldn't even care throw
curtains under the bus like this.

243
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:51,810
I'll speak for myself only.

244
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,780
I was just staring at
tits and pussy is nonstop.

245
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:56,340
I just I'll speak for.

246
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,430
I was when he was doing,

247
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:00,630
I was staring at him and then the next
week and the next time he came in,

248
00:08:00,631 --> 00:08:01,650
the next month it was a,

249
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,220
there was like they put like partitions
up for the girl and I'm like,

250
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:06,300
yeah,

251
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,850
but I'm not going to pretend that I
wasn't back there to look above what you

252
00:08:08,851 --> 00:08:11,100
want me to force myself
to look into your eyes.

253
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:13,320
If you're that comfortable being naked,

254
00:08:13,321 --> 00:08:14,520
then be comfortable
with me staring at you.

255
00:08:14,521 --> 00:08:15,354
Buzzy.

256
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:16,530
That's what I'm saying.

257
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:17,403
Yeah.

258
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:17,990
That's me,

259
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:18,750
a tee shirt.

260
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:19,583
It should.

261
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:20,250
It should.
