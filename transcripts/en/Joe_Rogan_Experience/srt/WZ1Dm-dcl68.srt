00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:06,570
Hello friends and neighbors. That's,
that's the nice way of doing it.

2
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:10,800
This episode of the Joe Rogan experience
is brought to you by legal zoom.

3
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:15,930
Legal Zoom is a way that you can deal
with a lot of legal shit online without

4
00:00:15,931 --> 00:00:20,340
actually leaving your house.
Instead of going to a lawyers office,

5
00:00:20,341 --> 00:00:22,500
making an appointment and
paying them a bunch of money,

6
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:27,180
you can be drunk and naked and still do
legal things as long as you're not too

7
00:00:27,181 --> 00:00:32,040
drunk that you can't click the right
things, but you could start an LLC.

8
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:34,380
You can incorporate for just 99 bucks.

9
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:39,660
You can set up your family with a last
will for just 69 bucks or get a living

10
00:00:39,661 --> 00:00:44,661
trust power of attorney and more
legal zoom gets the job done right?

11
00:00:44,851 --> 00:00:49,851
910 customers would recommend the service
to their friends and family and when,

12
00:00:49,981 --> 00:00:53,820
remember when we talk about nine out of
10 you got to always factor in the fact

13
00:00:53,821 --> 00:00:57,450
that at least one at every
10 people is a fucking idiot.

14
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:01,860
Think of that and legal zoom
is pretty good that way.

15
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:06,540
They also have an a plus from the better
business bureau. That's pretty sporty.

16
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,760
Sounds good.
And if you panic,

17
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:13,820
legal zoom can connect you with a third
party attorney and you know they can set

18
00:01:14,191 --> 00:01:18,030
it up so that like if you're on the way
and you're in the middle of filling all

19
00:01:18,031 --> 00:01:19,800
this stuff out and you're like,
oh my God, I'm going to jail.

20
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:23,460
Legal Zoom will hook you up with a
lawyer thing. Clean up your mess,

21
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:26,880
but you don't have to worry about it.
Virtually everyone can do it. I'm on.

22
00:01:26,881 --> 00:01:31,110
It was incorporated with legal zoom.
Brian formed a you here.

23
00:01:31,111 --> 00:01:33,330
I can't breathe so good.
And my nose is kind of stuffy.

24
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:37,530
I have a tiny bit of a cold today.
Just a tiny bit.

25
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,620
So if it sounds like I'm breathing weird,
that's where that's coming from.

26
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:44,100
A legal zoom is not a law firm,

27
00:01:44,101 --> 00:01:48,560
but they can connect you with a third
party attorney and provide you with self

28
00:01:48,561 --> 00:01:53,160
help services. That's like lawyer
speak right there. Notice that part.

29
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:56,250
It's funny. Everything else on
the page is like normal print.

30
00:01:56,251 --> 00:02:00,280
That part's bold and covered
in yellow because we didn't.

31
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,250
A strange time,
ladies and gentlemen,

32
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:06,360
no one believes anyone and you get a
special discount from listening to this

33
00:02:06,361 --> 00:02:07,194
podcast.

34
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,070

35
00:02:11,071 --> 00:02:12,120
In the past 12 years,

36
00:02:12,121 --> 00:02:16,680
over 2 million Americans have used legal
zoom and they've saved a ton of money.

37
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:20,520
Go get yourself some legal zoom.
Ladies and gentlemen, please for you.

38
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:23,790
And for those around you were
also brought to you by Lumosity.

39
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:25,770
And the Masa is one of my favorite,
uh,

40
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:30,450
of the sponsors because it's games for
your brain that actually can sort of

41
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:33,870
stimulate your brain in a way
where it will be more fit.

42
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:37,590
Does that make any sense? You know, they
say chess is really good for your mind.

43
00:02:37,591 --> 00:02:40,350
It's really good for your thinking.
I don't know how they know that,

44
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,960
but apparently they do.
Well,

45
00:02:42,961 --> 00:02:46,350
that thought process behind it has
been extended to a video games.

46
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:49,800
So if anybody ever starts telling you, hey
man, you should be playing video games,

47
00:02:49,801 --> 00:02:52,410
it rot your brain.
Actually, they don't stupid.

48
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,350
They're actually good for your brain.
That's sounds ridiculous,

49
00:02:55,351 --> 00:02:57,320
but it's not something people
want to hear because you know,

50
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:00,310
you look at a kid playing like you know,
battlefield,

51
00:03:00,311 --> 00:03:03,300
whatever the fuck his name of
these games are now Titanfall,

52
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:04,330
that's supposed to be the new one.
Right?

53
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:06,640
Everybody keeps telling me about that one.
Yeah.

54
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:09,280
People were saying if you get
back into video games a stop,

55
00:03:09,281 --> 00:03:11,830
stop trying to drag me in the
fucking hell of your existence.

56
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:15,430
But if you're in that hell,
you're actually exercising your brain.

57
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,320
It sounds crazy but it does,

58
00:03:17,321 --> 00:03:22,300
but there's a way to do it where it's
designed specifically for your brain and

59
00:03:22,301 --> 00:03:25,060
for your needs and that's
what Lumosity provides.

60
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:30,390
Lumosity is essentially
like a personalized gym
for your brain and when you

61
00:03:30,491 --> 00:03:31,810
click the get started button,

62
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,210
they take you through a bunch of
different things you're trying to do like

63
00:03:34,211 --> 00:03:37,000
memory,
like remembering patterns and locations,

64
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:39,220
associating names with faces,

65
00:03:39,221 --> 00:03:42,100
keeping track of multiple pieces of
information and things along those lines.

66
00:03:42,101 --> 00:03:45,250
You could check them off and
attention is another one.

67
00:03:45,251 --> 00:03:47,530
Things like ignoring
distractions, blah, blah, blah,

68
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:52,600
speed decision making and time sensitive
situations and all these things.

69
00:03:52,601 --> 00:03:55,150
You fill them out and then they dig,

70
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:58,510
create a program that's based on
the data that you've provided them.

71
00:03:58,511 --> 00:04:02,080
It's really kind of cool. It's based
on the science of neuroplasticity.

72
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:05,200
What does that mean? Coming out
of my mouth, almost nothing.

73
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:08,830
I don't know what the fuck neuroplasticity
is. Apparently scientists do though,

74
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:09,760
and they like it.

75
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:15,580
They think it's good for you and the
thing about Lumosity that I enjoy is it's

76
00:04:15,581 --> 00:04:19,570
fun. They're cool fun games. They're
like, you're working out your brain,

77
00:04:19,571 --> 00:04:20,860
but it's actually enjoyable.

78
00:04:20,861 --> 00:04:25,300
I would do it if it had nothing to do
with my brain if it didn't help my brain,

79
00:04:25,301 --> 00:04:27,310
but I know it does help my brain
so it doesn't make any sense.

80
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:31,120
What I really am I just talking
shit I like. I enjoy it though.

81
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:36,360
Go to lumosity.com/joe
that's lumosity.com/joe Click
the start training button

82
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:38,650
and start playing your first game.

83
00:04:38,651 --> 00:04:43,651
That's lumosity.com/joe it's really
interesting and I'm really excited that

84
00:04:44,231 --> 00:04:47,920
someone came up with something like this.
Cause Chris Mcguire,

85
00:04:47,921 --> 00:04:50,700
he's a good buddy of mine, used
to have a program for his, uh,

86
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:54,820
he had like one of those little Nintendo
game boys or some shit and it had a

87
00:04:54,821 --> 00:04:58,810
program in it that was
designed specifically when I
was little handheld Jeremy's

88
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:03,520
and it was designed specifically for brain
games and I was always thinking, wow,

89
00:05:03,521 --> 00:05:04,690
I need something like that,

90
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,180
but I'm not going to go out and
buy what a stupid little game. Boy,

91
00:05:07,181 --> 00:05:11,410
it's just to get your brain games. So
I never did, but I do lose your mind.

92
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:14,020
Use used Lumosity and you should too.

93
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:19,180
lumosity.com/joe we're also brought to
you by [inaudible] dot com that's o n n

94
00:05:19,601 --> 00:05:24,540
I. T. A human optimization
website. Who? Yeah,

95
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:29,520
man, I know Si. No, no, no.
I'm okay. I'm just, I'm,

96
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:33,430
I'm, I'm right now I'm not sick, but
I could be, you know what I'm saying?

97
00:05:33,431 --> 00:05:35,470
Like I'm battling battling,

98
00:05:35,471 --> 00:05:39,130
I'm fighting it back on at.com is a,
like I said,

99
00:05:39,131 --> 00:05:43,660
a human optimization website and when a
Aubrey and myself tried to do with on it

100
00:05:43,661 --> 00:05:48,160
is provide you guys with all the stuff
that we found that we use that we enjoy.

101
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:52,270
Things like strength and conditioning
equipment like kettle bells and battle

102
00:05:52,271 --> 00:05:56,790
ropes, things that just provide an
awesome workout. Steel maces um,

103
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:58,610
they look like weapons
but they're not there.

104
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:02,480
What they are is this weird offset wait,
that's a long metal pole.

105
00:06:02,481 --> 00:06:04,850
The big ball in the end of it,
it's very difficult,

106
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:09,740
weird to move around and when you move
it around you develop all these weird

107
00:06:09,741 --> 00:06:11,450
muscles,
functional muscles,

108
00:06:11,451 --> 00:06:15,710
muscles that work in an everyday
situation and also it helps your balance.

109
00:06:15,711 --> 00:06:17,120
It helps your coordination.

110
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:21,080
What I'm interested in when it comes to
strength and conditioning things are all

111
00:06:21,081 --> 00:06:23,240
things that improve athletic performance.

112
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:28,190
Things that you find when you watch
mixed martial arts fighters do their

113
00:06:28,191 --> 00:06:30,710
training routines, like when they do
their strength and conditioning routines,

114
00:06:30,711 --> 00:06:33,470
they very rarely do traditional
weightlifting activities.

115
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:36,680
You'll see a lot of battle ropes.
You'll see a lot of kettle bells.

116
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:38,430
He sees a lot of things along those lines.

117
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:40,250
So that's the kind of stuff
that we try to provide.

118
00:06:40,251 --> 00:06:45,251
We try to provide things that actually
help the body move as a unit because as

119
00:06:45,351 --> 00:06:48,770
people have gotten a deeper and deeper
understanding about strength and fitness,

120
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:52,820
one of the things they realize, it's
like things like curls, like bicep curls.

121
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:56,330
They don't make any sense.
Like you don't really do that in the wild.

122
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,610
You don't ever just pick
something up only with your Bicep,

123
00:06:58,611 --> 00:07:01,070
you'd use your whole body and
then using your whole body,

124
00:07:01,071 --> 00:07:05,670
you make everything strong and using
only an individual muscle. You Ha,

125
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:07,970
you run the risk of imbalancing yourself.

126
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:11,810
Any of those things that you do do
any kind of training exercise you do,

127
00:07:11,811 --> 00:07:14,750
especially lifting weights.
Poolees go.

128
00:07:14,751 --> 00:07:17,900
If you can go to a trainer
to go to someone who knows
what they're doing so you

129
00:07:17,901 --> 00:07:21,740
don't get injured. It really sucks
getting injured when it's just ignorance.

130
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:24,920
So if you're about to embark on any
kind of weightlifting routine, you like,

131
00:07:24,921 --> 00:07:27,110
God dammit, Joe Rogan, I'm
tired of being a weak bitch.

132
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:30,140
I'm about to get it together
to start out really light.

133
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:33,050
You get a lot of shit done being,

134
00:07:33,051 --> 00:07:35,930
if you haven't done any work on it all
and you're really serious about it,

135
00:07:35,931 --> 00:07:37,940
find out if you're serious about it.
But don't even go to a gym.

136
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:41,600
Do Body weight squats, pushups,
and sit ups. That's it.

137
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:44,330
Just write down how many you can do.
Just do them too.

138
00:07:44,331 --> 00:07:48,230
You can't do them again and then write
it down and try and improve that number

139
00:07:48,231 --> 00:07:51,140
and do it for a few weeks and
then blow your money on the gym.

140
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:54,290
Cause you know what sucks.
Sign up for a gym and then not doing shit.

141
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:56,720
And then that money just gets taken out
of your account every month and you're

142
00:07:56,721 --> 00:08:01,460
like, I'm weak. Oh he can
lazy anyway on at.com.

143
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:05,010
Oh and and it, we sell all sorts of, um,

144
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:10,070
supplements and foods as well and buy
foods. I don't mean like groceries,

145
00:08:10,071 --> 00:08:11,660
but we have thought about doing that too.

146
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:16,720
The idea of combining or a working in
conjunction with a local farmers that farm

147
00:08:17,421 --> 00:08:20,720
organically is very exciting to us.
We've talked about that several times.

148
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,900
We're trying to figure out how
we could ever actually do it. Um,

149
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:25,490
but that might be in our future.

150
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:29,420
Just connecting you
maybe to local farmers,

151
00:08:29,421 --> 00:08:34,421
connecting you to a farmers that are
raising their beef grass fed and in a very

152
00:08:34,581 --> 00:08:35,420
ethical way.

153
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:38,590
Farmer farmers who are raising free
range chickens so you know you're,

154
00:08:38,591 --> 00:08:42,500
you're not buying your chickens from
prisoners a little prisoner chickens.

155
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:45,260
That's our concern.
What we're trying to do it on it.

156
00:08:45,261 --> 00:08:50,090
It's just connect you with everything
that we find beneficial in our life.

157
00:08:50,091 --> 00:08:51,890
Hence the term human optimization.

158
00:08:51,891 --> 00:08:55,950
Everything that we find that improves
cognitive function, that mood,

159
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:58,800
things that he,
that'll improve your immune system.

160
00:08:58,801 --> 00:09:02,940
Things that are just whatever we find
like what's a good digestible protein,

161
00:09:02,941 --> 00:09:05,840
hemp protein. Great. Where can we
get the best hemp protein Canada.

162
00:09:05,841 --> 00:09:09,180
It's the only place. Okay, what's the
highest grade? This stuff, let's buy that.

163
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,000
That's our attitude on it.
Have you used the code Dean Brogan?

164
00:09:12,001 --> 00:09:15,060
You will save 10% off any of the
supplements. The supplements,

165
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:17,880
the weird ones like new mood.
People are like, wait a minute,

166
00:09:17,881 --> 00:09:19,290
is a supplement for your mood?
Yes.

167
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:23,490
It's been known for a long time that
five HTP can actually improve your mood,

168
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:24,383
your mood.

169
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:29,430
It actually helps your body
produce serotonin and new
mood create contains five

170
00:09:29,431 --> 00:09:32,330
HTP and also contains l Tryptofan,

171
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:37,200
which also con converts to five HTP.
It's really fascinating stuff. Um,

172
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,660
and I'm, I might be wrong about those
things that are just said. How about that?

173
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,180
I mean,
I don't really know the fuck do I know?

174
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,760
I know what I've read though and I know
what, uh, what happens when I take it?

175
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:48,780
If you're concerned and you're like, what
if this is bullshit? Here's the deal.

176
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:52,050
At audit,
you have a first 30 pills.

177
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,050
You have a 90 day money back guarantee.
100%.

178
00:09:55,051 --> 00:09:57,960
You don't even have to return the pills
to say this didn't work and you get your

179
00:09:57,961 --> 00:10:02,400
money back. The last thing anybody wants
you to feel is like, this is a bad deal.

180
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:06,150
This is a bad situation. Try once you
don't like it, get your money back.

181
00:10:06,151 --> 00:10:08,370
Who Cares?
But if you do like it,

182
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:13,020
we will promise you that we will sell
you the best quality ingredients that we

183
00:10:13,021 --> 00:10:13,854
can find.

184
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:17,790
And being able to do it and distribute
it from one place like on it does,

185
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:22,100
allows us to put together combinations
that you just not going to see the, the,

186
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:26,850
the kind of dosages and purity that you're
going to get from Onnit products and

187
00:10:26,851 --> 00:10:29,130
a lot of other ones because
it's just not cost effective.

188
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:32,520
So we have an advantage in that and
then we just sell it online like that.

189
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:35,400
So if you're interested,
check it out.

190
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:39,660
Use the Codeword Rogan and you will save
10% off any and all supplements. Okay.

191
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:43,390
Amber Lyon is here.
[inaudible]

192
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:52,290
Logan experience.
Joe Rogan podcast by night all day.

193
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:56,710
Hey, Amber Lyon, last time we spoke

194
00:10:56,860 --> 00:11:00,760
podcast was two months before the world
was supposed to get an end. It was right.

195
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:04,120
It was that big. Uh, December 21st,

196
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:07,360
2012 scare that everybody was so
terrified about, uh, you know,

197
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:10,870
we had people telling us for sure
some changes going to happen.

198
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:14,350
I had Daniel Pinchbeck on the podcast.
He told me for sure,

199
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:18,090
I go for sure something's going to happen.
December 21st,

200
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:21,440
2012 is absolutely without a doubt.
All markers point to that. Okay,

201
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:23,890
and here we are and where we are.

202
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,500
And then been like, ah,
I don't want to be me.

203
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:35,450
I don't want to be mean. It's
just, uh, you know, it's silly.

204
00:11:35,451 --> 00:11:39,080
It's silly to think that you're going to
be the first guy ever to figure out how

205
00:11:39,081 --> 00:11:42,680
the, what's going to happen.
You see a common, nobody
else does. You see a comment?

206
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:47,330
It's super easy if you're like a
ray Kurzweil guy and you're, um,

207
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:52,390
super scientific and very technologically
in tune and you know what the latest

208
00:11:52,521 --> 00:11:56,260
technologies, so if he makes,
if Ray Kurzweil makes a
prediction about the future,

209
00:11:56,261 --> 00:11:57,640
you've got to take it into consideration.

210
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:00,850
He's predicted a lot of things predicted.
The Internet search engine,

211
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:03,930
I believe he had something to
do with speech to text. He,

212
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:08,560
he had a part in creating
that. So that guy, I believe,

213
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:11,590
but when you're a hippie rider,
like Daniel Pinchbeck,

214
00:12:11,591 --> 00:12:14,350
can you tell me it's going to be the
end of the world? I love your work, man.

215
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:15,640
Don't get me wrong.
I love that guy,

216
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:18,730
but I'm going to take it with a grain
that I should be really fair here.

217
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:21,550
Cause he did not say I was going to be
the end of the world. He did not at all.

218
00:12:21,551 --> 00:12:23,770
He thought that there was going to
be some sort of a paradigm shift.

219
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:25,030
And by the way,
he might be right.

220
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:28,630
I'm all just talking shit here
because like who knows me.

221
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:32,830
Maybe I'll shift did take place. We're
just not quite aware of it yet. You know,

222
00:12:32,831 --> 00:12:36,390
maybe it'll be looked at in history
like the French renaissance. Like what,

223
00:12:36,391 --> 00:12:40,720
when did you know, when did uh, the
inquisition and exactly, you know,

224
00:12:40,721 --> 00:12:45,640
did they feel it by the day? You
know, when did a World War II,

225
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:48,970
when it finally did end, when it
was d day, when did the dust settle?

226
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,820
When did everybody realized
what it incredible, insane,

227
00:12:51,821 --> 00:12:55,720
impactful moment that had just lived
through it probably takes a few years,

228
00:12:56,170 --> 00:13:00,460
you know, so maybe something happened
Internet wise in December 21st,

229
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:01,390
2012 we're just not aware.

230
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:05,230
Maybe that was when the NSA really kicked
it up a notch. You know? Who knows.

231
00:13:05,231 --> 00:13:07,480
I mean, maybe it was something, it's just,

232
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:11,680
it seems like no one ever
really predicts the future.

233
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:12,481
Of course not,

234
00:13:12,481 --> 00:13:16,770
and I believe that 2012 was a with
symbolic for an evolution of consciousness

235
00:13:16,771 --> 00:13:17,790
that we're going through,

236
00:13:17,791 --> 00:13:22,791
that we're finally starting to end this
madness as a species and an evolve to a

237
00:13:24,181 --> 00:13:26,520
more conscious species that's more aware.

238
00:13:26,521 --> 00:13:29,460
I just know even since the last
time I did your podcast show,

239
00:13:29,461 --> 00:13:32,820
just how much awakening has
happened across the country.

240
00:13:32,821 --> 00:13:37,470
I remember when I told you on the podcast
about how I suspected that potentially

241
00:13:37,471 --> 00:13:40,800
my phone had been tapped or is it the
government was looking through my phone

242
00:13:40,801 --> 00:13:44,280
while at the time people around me
thought I was crazy and paranoid,

243
00:13:44,281 --> 00:13:48,870
but now we have the NSA revelations that
weight on it. This really is happening.

244
00:13:48,871 --> 00:13:51,830
There's a reason why your phone
keeps shutting back on and you,

245
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,370
you may be in some foreign country,

246
00:13:53,371 --> 00:13:56,280
but your geo tracker is working
perfectly even though you don't have self

247
00:13:56,281 --> 00:14:00,450
service, which happens to me. A lot of
freaks me out. But um, but above all,

248
00:14:00,451 --> 00:14:04,940
I think that we are shifting and people
are awakening. Uh, at this point.

249
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:07,170
I think you're right and I think
Janet Pinch specs right now. Oh,

250
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:12,230
I own an apology. I just was too
ignorant to see the shift. Yeah,

251
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:12,981
no,

252
00:14:12,981 --> 00:14:16,700
I think there's most certainly something's
going on and I think a lot of it is

253
00:14:16,701 --> 00:14:18,590
that younger kids today,

254
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:22,520
they have not been inundated with the
same sort of propaganda that we grew up

255
00:14:22,521 --> 00:14:26,600
with and they're getting the Internet,
you know, from day one and they,

256
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:28,220
the exchange of information,

257
00:14:28,221 --> 00:14:32,950
the way it's done today is not just
more accurate than ever before. Like,

258
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:35,890
like you know, like someone tells you
something stupid and you go watch,

259
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:39,650
let me Google that and everyone googles
it and then that ends nonsense and ends

260
00:14:39,651 --> 00:14:43,190
a lot of nonsense conversations between
friends that would have gone for days

261
00:14:43,191 --> 00:14:45,920
and days and days when I was a kid,
when I was a kid,

262
00:14:45,921 --> 00:14:49,340
you had to go get a fucking encyclopedia
if you wanted to figure out whether

263
00:14:49,341 --> 00:14:52,220
someone was full of Shit.
And you had go through the encyclopedia

264
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:53,820
and then you had a memorizing quoted.

265
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:56,510
You couldn't just pull your phone up and
stick it in their face and go, shut up.

266
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:59,840
Dubby you don't know what you're talking
about. As Encyclopedia Britannica,

267
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:04,190
we'd get like 12 episodes, so a through
z and just have to pour through.

268
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:05,840
Those would go door to door.

269
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:08,120
Remember that we'd go door to door
and try to sell them to you. Yeah,

270
00:15:08,121 --> 00:15:11,690
we were the ones that bought them.
I grew up in the middle of the country.

271
00:15:11,691 --> 00:15:14,360
We were suckers for all the
door to door solicitors.

272
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:16,480
Door to door.
Solicitors are so weird.

273
00:15:16,481 --> 00:15:20,410
A charismatic person who's really good
at being slick and bullshitting you,

274
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:25,210
knocks on your door and sells you some
shit and tries to convince you to buy

275
00:15:25,211 --> 00:15:28,120
some shit like you don't even,
you're not even in the store.

276
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:32,470
They're sending these creepers all around
the country just knocking on people's

277
00:15:32,471 --> 00:15:36,220
doors and being slick.
He'd selling you vacuums and shit

278
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:41,210
or trying to save your soul. Those are
the best selling you their call. Yeah.

279
00:15:41,211 --> 00:15:42,920
When you're sitting in the living room,
you know,

280
00:15:42,921 --> 00:15:46,820
just relaxing and then someone knocks
on the door telling you everything about

281
00:15:46,821 --> 00:15:50,230
your life is wrong and you need
instant savings. That only happen

282
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:54,660
been once in my whole life. And it was
when I was a little kid and I remember,

283
00:15:54,661 --> 00:15:56,220
I think my grandfather was home.

284
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:59,860
I think my grandfather was
babysitting me and my sister, and uh,

285
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:03,570
someone came to the door. God, it was hard
to remember, but I remember it was like,

286
00:16:03,571 --> 00:16:08,010
nope, sorry, get out. Sorry. Thanks.
Thanks. Bye. And there was so insistent,

287
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,800
just so foolishly insistent,
you know,

288
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:13,350
wanting you to know that if
you don't know about this man,

289
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:15,060
you're going to miss the end of the world.

290
00:16:15,061 --> 00:16:19,530
They're predicting the end of the world.
It's just another 2012. It's another,

291
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:22,800
you know,
when those crazy people in San Diego,

292
00:16:22,801 --> 00:16:26,670
I'll put on the Nike's and
killed themselves because
they thought the Hale Bopp

293
00:16:26,671 --> 00:16:27,780
comment. People remember that. Yeah,

294
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:32,060
yeah, I remember that. But that was the
leader who had the, uh, he was bald. Yeah.

295
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:36,650
He looked very alienesque. Yes. I
forget homeboy's name. But yeah,

296
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:38,610
he was definitely a creeper.

297
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:43,810
I can't believe people followed him
based on his looks. He, he got me out.

298
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,950
Well, he was, uh, uh, I, you know,

299
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:50,850
I mean, look, if he could, Ron doss is
in the most normal looking duty there,

300
00:16:50,851 --> 00:16:52,940
but you know, you listen to
them when you hear him talking,

301
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:55,860
you realize this guys is
about as real as it gets. The,

302
00:16:55,861 --> 00:16:59,100
I would love to hear what this Hale
Bopp dude sounded like. You know,

303
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:01,590
maybe he was slick as fuck.
Maybe is a really good drawer.

304
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:05,760
Door salesman. You know, he didn't
he get them to castrate themselves.

305
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:07,380
Oh my God.
Take Castro

306
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:10,790
themselves to, or at least one of
them are. A couple of them did.

307
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:15,650
I think he felt like sexuality was a
imprisoning was probably some gay shit

308
00:17:15,651 --> 00:17:16,484
going on.

309
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:18,930
He was scary how quickly
people can become,

310
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:22,860
and we'll make something like that and
like actually castrate rate yourself. Yes.

311
00:17:22,861 --> 00:17:25,890
We say this when maybe he's correct areas.
There's the heaven's gate.

312
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:30,450
Maybe he's right. Yeah.
Name Marshall, Marshall.

313
00:17:30,451 --> 00:17:34,680
You silly man. Yeah. Um, who
knows. Maybe he was right.

314
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:36,960
Maybe they're all in another planet
right now. We're the soccer's.

315
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:39,930
Maybe they're living in paradise,
you know, we don't know.

316
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:44,380
You just see their shells with
their Nike Symbolic Nike's. And I,

317
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:48,450
I never believed that we get the true
story of what was going on from the

318
00:17:48,451 --> 00:17:50,160
government or from,
so you never

319
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,860
know. Maybe there was something
more to it. I don't know.

320
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,500
I don't think the governor,
they made up the castration thing

321
00:17:55,980 --> 00:18:00,230
that is possible. Right. They do shit
like that. Have you ever been a part of a,

322
00:18:00,231 --> 00:18:03,090
a story where you absolutely know
when you were working for CNN,

323
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:06,990
was there anything where you like,
I know that that's not how it happened.

324
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:09,690
I know it, what they're saying
on TV right now is nonsense.

325
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:14,290
Yeah, for sure. Uh, it happened
a lot of times. I think that,

326
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:16,510
especially across the media in general,

327
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:20,740
a lot of stories are just dumbed
down to the point that they just,

328
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:24,370
you lose the real essence
of the story. And, um,

329
00:18:24,371 --> 00:18:29,230
and that happened for me in the situation
of Bahrain I talked about thoroughly

330
00:18:29,231 --> 00:18:31,360
on your last show. But, um,

331
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:34,570
but sometimes I would see them
reporting things on air and,

332
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:39,130
and had watched documentaries that
they did and it was a stark contrast to

333
00:18:39,131 --> 00:18:41,500
complete opposite from what
I'd seen on the ground.

334
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:45,180
What did they feel like the first
time you ever saw like bullshit,

335
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:46,970
the first time you ever knew?
Like,

336
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:49,590
I'm sure in the beginning when you
first started being a reporter,

337
00:18:49,591 --> 00:18:54,180
you're probably very excited about the
prospect you work for CNN. Oh my goodness.

338
00:18:54,181 --> 00:18:55,710
You know,
this is going to be amazing.

339
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:59,730
I'm going to do some hardcore
investigative journalism
and other countries.

340
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:02,150
What the first time you saw some bullshit,
what were you like?

341
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:03,053
What was your thought?

342
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:07,610
Uh, I just was so let
down Joe, because I was,

343
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:11,720
it just was like taking your
dreams and just crushing them. Uh,

344
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:16,370
one story at a time and that's kind of
how it happened to me there. It, it just,

345
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:18,380
it wasn't like one big incident happened,

346
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:22,790
but there was a little bit of censorship
with each story over and over and over

347
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:27,980
to the point that I realized that the
mainstream media was just misleading the

348
00:19:27,981 --> 00:19:30,500
people.
And I was becoming a cog in the machine.

349
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:34,310
And so I'd gotten into journalism to help
people and tried to change this world,

350
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:39,350
but instead I was actually helping give
the station credibility and helping

351
00:19:39,351 --> 00:19:43,550
spread what I believe to be lies.
And, and that's just a real,

352
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:46,640
just a devastating, uh, moment.

353
00:19:46,641 --> 00:19:51,350
And it caused me a lot of
stress over the years for sure.

354
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:53,330
I'm sure. Um, it's,

355
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:58,430
is it a situation where the news
just becomes any other business,

356
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:03,900
any other organism, any other thing
that wants to grow and stay alive.

357
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:08,430
And the only way to do that is to
touch as many bases as you can,

358
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:12,240
spread out as far as you can and
collect as much money as you can.

359
00:20:12,241 --> 00:20:15,810
And somewhere along the line you have to,
you have to make some deals.

360
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:19,130
Exactly. And I think you hit
the nail on the head, Joe.

361
00:20:19,131 --> 00:20:23,360
And I think what's going on is that
a lot of these news outlets are,

362
00:20:23,361 --> 00:20:27,870
like you said, corporations and their
main goal is to make money. And,

363
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:29,720
and that's what was
happening in the case of CNN.

364
00:20:29,721 --> 00:20:32,630
They were taking money
from different governments,

365
00:20:32,631 --> 00:20:37,160
pro US governments worldwide in exchange
for producing these documentaries that

366
00:20:37,161 --> 00:20:41,330
made the government's look good.
It was, it was propaganda and um,

367
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:44,210
and bottom line was,
was to make money also.

368
00:20:44,211 --> 00:20:49,211
I think there's other forces at play
trying kind of keep a pro us a agenda.

369
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:52,780
It had many of these outlets as well.

370
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:57,840
Wow. So you leave that,
you write your book,

371
00:20:57,870 --> 00:21:01,290
which is excellent. We have a, we have
a copy of weight. It's back there.

372
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:05,460
We had so many books on the
desk and dated the literature.

373
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,810
But Molly crab, apple did
the cover. Right. And she has

374
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:13,210
oh yeah, she did some art inside the
book. Yeah. Molly is such a talented,

375
00:21:13,211 --> 00:21:15,030
amazing artists.
It was really an honor

376
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:18,330
be able to have her work. Yeah. We had her
on the podcast. She was really cool too.

377
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,820
She's, she's free, you
know, like she's just,

378
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:24,330
when she talks like she's not
in hindered by, she's just free.

379
00:21:24,331 --> 00:21:28,560
She is who she is and what she's really
talented, really interesting art to very,

380
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:29,131
you know,

381
00:21:29,131 --> 00:21:33,390
she's one of those artists where you see
like one of her pieces and you almost

382
00:21:33,391 --> 00:21:37,500
immediately recognizes her cause she's
got that very unusual distinct style.

383
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:39,060
Those faces that she draws.

384
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:43,050
She has this very unusual
and like compelling style.

385
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:46,080
And I liked that she adds
politics and do her art.

386
00:21:46,081 --> 00:21:49,850
She's not scared to take that
jump. So much art has been,
you know, music, movies,

387
00:21:49,851 --> 00:21:53,280
everything has just been dumbed down
in order to please these corporations.

388
00:21:53,281 --> 00:21:57,960
And Molly is really joining
several artists and sticking
her neck out there and

389
00:21:57,961 --> 00:22:02,310
willing to criticize people through
her art and criticize the system.

390
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:07,010
Yeah. And sort of expose things that
she doesn't, doesn't like. It's cool.

391
00:22:07,011 --> 00:22:09,030
It's cool that, so you
write this book, you,

392
00:22:09,031 --> 00:22:14,031
you put the book out and you did our
podcast and during the podcast we had a

393
00:22:14,811 --> 00:22:17,880
conversation about psychedelics.
And um,

394
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:20,870
I mean I've had a lot of conversations
with people about psychedelics.

395
00:22:20,871 --> 00:22:22,610
It's a question that
people ask all the time.

396
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:26,980
And I'm really fortunate to know a bunch
of people know the actual answers to

397
00:22:26,981 --> 00:22:31,910
those questions. So you know, I have
this conversation and you, you say,

398
00:22:31,911 --> 00:22:32,151
okay,

399
00:22:32,151 --> 00:22:36,020
let me find out what the fuss is all
about and you get on the fucking raft and

400
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:39,830
go down to the jungle.
You like dove head in.

401
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:44,330
I've literally been tripping around
the world for the past year. So crazy.

402
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:46,400
So before the podcast,
nothing,

403
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:48,480
nothing the worst I had done,

404
00:22:48,481 --> 00:22:50,700
which not even worse because
it's medicinal as we know,

405
00:22:50,701 --> 00:22:53,970
but it was like smoked a
joint of marijuana in college.

406
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:57,420
Cause I grew up in the Midwest shell
and we were fed talk about propaganda.

407
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:02,400
We were fed propaganda from day
one about just say no to drugs.

408
00:23:02,401 --> 00:23:07,401
And I even remember my grandmother
taped this episode of Oprah where this

409
00:23:07,981 --> 00:23:11,430
scientist was on talking about
how Mtma eats holes in your brain.

410
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:12,900
It's later been debunked.

411
00:23:12,901 --> 00:23:15,960
And that was proven that the
diagrams the scientists showed,

412
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:20,490
we're just showing cerebral blood flow
through the brain and the Mtma isn't

413
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,510
actually harmful.

414
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,990
But I mean that's the kind of
propaganda we were fed constantly.

415
00:23:24,991 --> 00:23:29,370
And I remember my grandma would take all
these shows on 2020 and all these new

416
00:23:29,371 --> 00:23:33,510
shows and bring them over to the house
and force me to sit down and watch all

417
00:23:33,511 --> 00:23:34,980
this anti-drug propaganda.

418
00:23:34,981 --> 00:23:39,981
So I associated all drugs as being
evil and just bad for you and Nadia.

419
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:46,100
Yeah,
it was funny way you described that.

420
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:48,350
That's the way to describe it.
The worst I ever did.

421
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:52,580
You smoke a joint like it's the eight
the knee jerk way of approaching it.

422
00:23:52,581 --> 00:23:53,570
The worst I ever did.

423
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:58,760
So now I have to just completely retrain
my thoughts system because I've had 30

424
00:24:00,181 --> 00:24:04,380
years of this propaganda and um,
and I've realized Joe,

425
00:24:04,381 --> 00:24:08,880
that we are horribly mistaken and a lot
of situations in this country when it

426
00:24:08,881 --> 00:24:11,760
comes to labeling things,
medicines, verse drugs,

427
00:24:11,761 --> 00:24:16,761
and a lot of substances and natural
plants that natives have used as medicines

428
00:24:16,831 --> 00:24:18,030
for thousands of years,

429
00:24:18,031 --> 00:24:22,230
extremely effective medicines are
being called drugs and being labeled as

430
00:24:22,231 --> 00:24:26,200
schedule one substances. And it's
just really unfortunate. Yeah.

431
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:30,760
It's unfortunate and in a lot of ways
the people that have never experienced

432
00:24:30,761 --> 00:24:35,080
these things, it's impossible
to understand without trying it.

433
00:24:35,081 --> 00:24:38,500
And I don't blame you
for being incredulous.

434
00:24:38,530 --> 00:24:41,110
I don't blame you for being
skeptical and you should be,

435
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:46,480
people who are skeptical
are really important because
it puts out the debate and

436
00:24:46,481 --> 00:24:48,700
whether they're correct or
whether they're incorrect,

437
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:52,690
it's always good having a bunch of
smart minds looking at it from different

438
00:24:52,691 --> 00:24:56,210
directions, trying to
dissect it. And a big, uh,

439
00:24:56,211 --> 00:25:01,211
a big part of our dissecting when it
comes to our culture is our law system or

440
00:25:01,631 --> 00:25:04,540
legal system, what's legal and what's
not? What should be allowed to do?

441
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,070
What should you not be allowed to do?

442
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:10,420
And we have to figure out what it is
we're going to allow to influence that

443
00:25:10,421 --> 00:25:11,141
legal system.

444
00:25:11,141 --> 00:25:15,190
Because if it's corporations and the
people that are trying to protect prophet

445
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:18,700
man, you're going into a weird
fucking direction because guess what?

446
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:21,010
There's profit in that other stuff too.
You just,

447
00:25:21,011 --> 00:25:23,740
you'd dummies just haven't tapped
into the psychedelic profit.

448
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:27,220
There's profit in what's going on in
Colorado right now is just starting to

449
00:25:27,221 --> 00:25:31,010
realize, oh shit, there's profit
in this. Duh, people love it. You,

450
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:35,140
you just think that the only way to get
money is by selling fucking pills that

451
00:25:35,141 --> 00:25:38,050
you make what you're doing as being a
hater and you try to hoard the market.

452
00:25:38,051 --> 00:25:42,250
You're trying to control all the drugs
and there's some good drugs out there

453
00:25:42,251 --> 00:25:43,540
that are pharmaceutical drugs.
There's,

454
00:25:43,541 --> 00:25:47,020
there's fantastic medications that have
helped people with all sorts of ailments,

455
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:51,850
but that doesn't mean that you,
with your fantastic drugs at aid,

456
00:25:51,851 --> 00:25:56,680
all these people should be able to
stop natural things like that's crazy.

457
00:25:56,890 --> 00:26:01,030
And that's where as a culture we
got to put the brakes. We just,

458
00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:04,270
it's not saying that pharmaceutical
companies are bad because they're not,

459
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:08,110
they're great pharmaceutical companies
are provided people with medications that

460
00:26:08,111 --> 00:26:11,530
have vastly improved
their lives like Viagra.

461
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:15,280
There's a lot of people out there that
just wouldn't have had sex 2030 years ago.

462
00:26:15,281 --> 00:26:16,570
It was,
it was over.

463
00:26:16,810 --> 00:26:21,810
And then like a old picture that some
how or another summons up the courage to

464
00:26:22,031 --> 00:26:26,440
get off the game and dust off his jeans.
He's back in there. You know, look,

465
00:26:26,441 --> 00:26:28,690
there's, there's medication.
That's a bad one too.

466
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:31,300
This is medications for people
that have actual real diseases.

467
00:26:31,301 --> 00:26:33,610
Not just can't get boners,
but you know there's,

468
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:37,480
there's really important medications,
but as a culture,

469
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:41,030
if there's one thing
that when people take it,

470
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:44,550
it almost universally gives
them a new perspective.

471
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:49,200
Almost universally makes them more
aware of their actions, more objective,

472
00:26:49,201 --> 00:26:52,410
more sensitive, more work. It calms them.

473
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:56,520
It gives people a sense of
peace about leaving this life.

474
00:26:56,550 --> 00:27:00,090
It gives you a sense of, I don't think
we know what we're talking about.

475
00:27:00,091 --> 00:27:03,120
It gives you a sense of, I think there
might be some other shit besides this.

476
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:06,090
That sounds, that sounds just
like the heaven's gate cult.

477
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:09,990
That sounds just like anybody else that's
telling you that they know something

478
00:27:09,991 --> 00:27:10,950
that other people don't know.

479
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:13,830
Most people were immediately
skeptical and they should be,

480
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:15,860
but this isn't nonsense.

481
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:19,410
This is some medicine that
helps human beings evolve.

482
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:24,090
And it's been here for thousands of years
and it's one of the measures as to how

483
00:27:24,091 --> 00:27:28,020
weird we are today.
One of the reasons why we're so chaotic,

484
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:33,260
why we live on this momentum of his
incredibly ignorant pass and never stopped

485
00:27:33,391 --> 00:27:37,050
to analyze it and change it. One reason
is the lack of these psychedelics.

486
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:40,140
It's like we're missing vitamin
scene. We have scurvy. I mean,

487
00:27:40,141 --> 00:27:41,520
that's really what our culture is.

488
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:45,210
It's mad and loony because
it's not looking at itself.

489
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:46,780
Exactly,
Joe.

490
00:27:46,781 --> 00:27:50,620
And I think what's going on is that
a lot of us have bottled up trauma

491
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:53,820
throughout our lives through childhood
especially. That's when I'll,

492
00:27:53,821 --> 00:27:57,890
a lot of people get the
footprints of trauma in their
soul and, and just just, uh,

493
00:27:57,910 --> 00:28:01,240
through PTSD, car accidents,
dangerous situations you're in,

494
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:05,590
and you keep this trauma bottled up
inside of your body without releasing it.

495
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:08,200
And it leads to this collective madness.
And,

496
00:28:08,210 --> 00:28:12,370
and I think what we're facing as a society
is the limbic system of your brain is

497
00:28:12,371 --> 00:28:15,850
a part of your brain that deals
with emotional processing.

498
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:20,920
And that's what psychedelics are
fantastic. It actually re, uh,

499
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:24,310
leading to neurogenesis,
restructuring the limbic system,

500
00:28:24,311 --> 00:28:27,610
helping people get rid of
all of this trauma. And,

501
00:28:27,670 --> 00:28:32,380
and really I think that the cause of most
of this madness is a collective limbic

502
00:28:32,381 --> 00:28:35,380
system malfunction in society right now.
And I,

503
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:38,230
I believe that wars fighting,
I'll,

504
00:28:38,231 --> 00:28:43,231
all of the environmental destruction
is just a symptom of this limbic system

505
00:28:43,451 --> 00:28:44,284
malfunction.

506
00:28:44,410 --> 00:28:48,700
And I think if we're able to actually get
in to the core of our insanity and all

507
00:28:48,701 --> 00:28:50,620
these mental health disorders and society,

508
00:28:50,621 --> 00:28:55,210
then we'll be able to really evolve
as, as a species. But I think that,

509
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,100
like you said,
the key to that are,

510
00:28:57,101 --> 00:28:59,920
are these psychedelic medicines
because for a lot of people,

511
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:04,510
they're not able to actually overcome
that trauma without, without the help of,

512
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:05,373
of psychedelic.

513
00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:09,510
I think you're, you're absolutely
right. And I think that this, um,

514
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:11,490
this weird world that
we live in right now,

515
00:29:11,491 --> 00:29:14,970
we will make these incredibly beneficial
things that don't kill anybody illegal.

516
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:18,300
Um, it starting to come
to light now. And, um,

517
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:20,640
maybe that's what the 2012 thing was.

518
00:29:20,641 --> 00:29:22,830
Maybe we just don't realize
it because we're a part of it.

519
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:28,580
But I think that people are so much more
aware of how bizarre and finite this

520
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:35,250
experiences and how many
people are running around
this experience acting as if

521
00:29:35,281 --> 00:29:38,730
everything's normal. Well, this
is not normal. Nothing's normal.

522
00:29:38,731 --> 00:29:42,040
We have madness at every turn.
We're still blowing each other

523
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:46,120
up with bullets were still shooting
missiles at each other. You know, we're,

524
00:29:46,121 --> 00:29:50,500
we're fucking crazy with.
This is a weird species we are a part of.

525
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:54,690
And I think when you, when you look at
the possibilities and the potentials,

526
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:58,870
like how did we get to where we are?
Like what, what, what is, what's missing?

527
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:01,570
What's wrong with us? We
need spirituality. That's
what everyone always says.

528
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:03,670
We need religion.
And they're probably right.

529
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:06,430
You know what you get
from being a Christian,

530
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:10,650
what you get from like
true belief in any God and,

531
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:15,650
and if true belief in the power
of any enlightened, omnipotent,

532
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:18,970
being, omnipotent, being you, what you,

533
00:30:18,971 --> 00:30:23,971
what you get is this feeling of humility
and this feeling of connection to all

534
00:30:24,401 --> 00:30:26,980
that is right. You know, that's
what you get out of the, the,

535
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:31,480
the real religious experience.
And that's what you get from psychedelics.

536
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,640
And people don't want to hear that.

537
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:37,780
They want to hear that you're just trying
to escape reality. You're just weak.

538
00:30:37,781 --> 00:30:40,710
You're just scared reality.
Oh, that's what you want to do.

539
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:43,900
And I see Amber Lyon,
well, you're telling me,

540
00:30:43,901 --> 00:30:48,400
so you just fucking dive into your
fantasy world of dancing mice and fucking

541
00:30:48,401 --> 00:30:52,410
Rodeo music. And you think you're so
fucking smart. Now you're going to Tom,

542
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:54,190
tell me how to live my life.

543
00:30:54,390 --> 00:30:58,680
It is nearly impossible. It's impossible.
And psychedelics to escape reality,

544
00:30:58,681 --> 00:31:01,440
whereas other drugs and I,
and I think that's one once again,

545
00:31:01,441 --> 00:31:06,210
part of the propaganda, whereas other
drugs and alcohol make you escape reality.

546
00:31:06,211 --> 00:31:09,150
Psychedelics actually
force you to sit down,

547
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:13,560
objective Lee and analyze your life and,
and solve your problems with a clear,

548
00:31:13,561 --> 00:31:16,920
silent mind. And for many people,
it's the first time in their lives,

549
00:31:16,921 --> 00:31:19,050
their mind is actually silent.
They're self critical.

550
00:31:19,051 --> 00:31:23,640
Part of their brain is silent and they
can sit back and analyze portions of

551
00:31:23,641 --> 00:31:28,190
their life and come up with solutions
to just make themselves a better person.

552
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:31,540
Yeah, that sounds ridiculous, doesn't it?

553
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:34,700
More ridiculous,
Joe,

554
00:31:34,701 --> 00:31:38,900
is that something that grows on cow
poop all over the world and and,

555
00:31:38,901 --> 00:31:41,680
and forests all over the world is,
is illegal and,

556
00:31:41,681 --> 00:31:44,660
and something that is
manufactured by our own bodies.

557
00:31:44,661 --> 00:31:47,050
DMT is also illegal.
So you're,

558
00:31:47,051 --> 00:31:51,370
you're saying that my pineal gland should
be locked up in a cage, Huh? Yeah. Yeah.

559
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:54,520
It's hilarious. Your brain is a drug
factory of illegal drug factory.

560
00:31:54,521 --> 00:31:58,000
It's literally like making saliva illegal.
If saliva was psychoactive,

561
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:01,630
it's so stupid. It turns from kind
of have a great joke about that.

562
00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:05,050
[inaudible] was talking about
DMT being processed by the body.

563
00:32:05,051 --> 00:32:09,830
So essentially said everyone's holding
like you're, you're all to arrest you.

564
00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:14,560
They can arrest you for the components
of your own being. Wait a minute.

565
00:32:14,561 --> 00:32:19,060
What if they could somehow or another
extract your blood and you had like a vial

566
00:32:19,061 --> 00:32:21,100
of your blood, you're allowed
to walk around with that. Right?

567
00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:24,470
I don't think anybody could stop you
for that. I'm Selena jellied. Yeah,

568
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:29,540
her and Billy Bob, right. Didn't they
cut each other crazy assholes. Um,

569
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:30,970
I don't think anybody can stop you,

570
00:32:30,971 --> 00:32:34,420
but if you had like a little
little shot of your own DMT,

571
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:37,690
you would be in possession of
a schedule one illegal drug.

572
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:39,920
Like it put you in a cage for yeah,
for sure.

573
00:32:40,170 --> 00:32:44,090
Hilarious. I don't think he can
extract it that way by the way. And I,

574
00:32:44,091 --> 00:32:47,900
I can't think you enough, Joe, for, uh,
really sticking your neck out there.

575
00:32:47,901 --> 00:32:52,280
And really, I know you faced
a lot of criticism for your
support of psychedelics.

576
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:56,370
Not really. No. It's been pretty easy.
I'm gonna be honest with Ya. Okay.

577
00:32:57,380 --> 00:33:00,220
I'm sitting here given this like
heartfelt, no, you don't have to,

578
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:04,430
but I just think it's a great way to,
it's a great position to be in.

579
00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:05,410
But I did take

580
00:33:05,410 --> 00:33:08,300
you seriously that day in the podcast
when you told me mushrooms could change

581
00:33:08,301 --> 00:33:10,790
the world and it really
planted a seed in my head,

582
00:33:10,791 --> 00:33:14,870
which sprouted this journey that I've
been doing around the world investigating

583
00:33:14,871 --> 00:33:19,040
these medicines. And, um, that never
would've happened. My, you know,

584
00:33:19,041 --> 00:33:21,980
my life wouldn't be in
such the amazing state.

585
00:33:21,981 --> 00:33:26,030
I feel like it is a now if
it hadn't been for you, uh,

586
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:27,680
having the gumption to,

587
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:30,590
to talk about this and start
this dialogue is our country.

588
00:33:30,591 --> 00:33:34,280
Cause psychedelics have been so taboo,
especially in the mainstream. And I,

589
00:33:34,670 --> 00:33:38,770
and I think you're really helping to
shift that consciousness nationwide.

590
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:41,840
I honestly don't think I am.
I think I'm just a part of the,

591
00:33:41,841 --> 00:33:44,950
the whole thing itself. I mean,
it's very nice to try to give me,

592
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:49,900
I don't deserve any credit, nor
do I want any, uh, uh, I just, um,

593
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,520
I,
I'm a,

594
00:33:51,850 --> 00:33:56,850
I'm shocked that more people don't know
about the experiences and I feel a duty

595
00:33:57,580 --> 00:33:58,510
because I've been there.

596
00:33:58,511 --> 00:34:02,290
It's just like if you and your friends
were starving to death and you found some

597
00:34:02,291 --> 00:34:04,270
food and the test, and you're like,
guys, come here, come here, come here.

598
00:34:04,271 --> 00:34:05,380
I found the food.
I found the food.

599
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,810
Would you want all this credit
for foreign enough food? No.

600
00:34:07,811 --> 00:34:11,380
You'd want your friends to have the food.
That's how I feel like. Feel like, uh,

601
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:16,240
you know what? What we're all experiencing
right now is we is a wait, what moment?

602
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:20,320
The whole coach culture is
going, wait, wait, wait, wait.
What? Wait, wait, wait, wait,

603
00:34:20,321 --> 00:34:23,530
wait a minute.
The NSA is listening to my fucking emails.

604
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:26,350
They're listening to my voicemails.
They're the reading my emails.

605
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:30,460
I don't do anything wrong,
man. Come on. I'm a fucking
insurance salesman. And then,

606
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:32,020
and then people go, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

607
00:34:32,050 --> 00:34:35,320
What marijuana makes how much
in fucking taxes for Colorado?

608
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:39,220
They make how much we know we're running
out of fucking money for schools and we

609
00:34:39,221 --> 00:34:41,000
could pay for that with weed,
but be,

610
00:34:41,001 --> 00:34:44,530
and people got to smoke the same amount
of weed anyways, statistically proven.

611
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:48,010
What the fuck is going on?
When you look at [inaudible],

612
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:50,740
we're going to go into Syria. Wait,
Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, whoa, Whoa, whoa.

613
00:34:50,741 --> 00:34:55,180
What the fuck are we doing this? Wait,
what moment is we're all a part of this?

614
00:34:55,181 --> 00:34:57,870
Wait, what moment? You're a big part
of this? Wait, what moment? Yeah.

615
00:34:57,910 --> 00:35:02,770
You're a big part of it by sticking your
neck out about by rain and about CNN

616
00:35:02,771 --> 00:35:06,520
and about, you know, working
for a corporation and being
honest about it, you, you,

617
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:08,830
you stuck your neck out about it.
We're all just,

618
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:13,600
we're all forced into this reality.
We didn't ask to be here.

619
00:35:13,601 --> 00:35:15,040
We were, you know, hey,

620
00:35:15,041 --> 00:35:18,690
can you give birth to me so I can grow
up in the 21st century and fake knowns?

621
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:23,200
She's, this is what you get. You got
nobody asked you, this is what you get.

622
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:26,950
And I think all of us realize that
that was the same for our far parents.

623
00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:29,770
It was the same for our grandparents.
It was the same for everybody.

624
00:35:29,890 --> 00:35:33,880
And nobody hit the brakes. Nobody had the
wait what moment where they went, wait,

625
00:35:33,881 --> 00:35:35,560
wait, wait, wait, what
the fuck are we doing?

626
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:40,320
Everybody just kept going and then had
heart attacks and died and taught a bunch

627
00:35:40,321 --> 00:35:41,640
of nonsense to their kids.

628
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:46,050
And they went and they had heart attacks
and died teaching a bunch of nonsense

629
00:35:46,051 --> 00:35:49,590
to their kids. And then the internet
came along and that's the way,

630
00:35:49,591 --> 00:35:53,280
what moment and the wait, what moment?
The real tipping point is people like you.

631
00:35:53,281 --> 00:35:56,370
People like me, people like anybody
that's a part of the, wait, what moment?

632
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:59,750
That might be my new t shirt and

633
00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:06,030
Peters. It's great. Yeah, we had him
on the podcast. He's fucking crazy.

634
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:09,800
He doesn't,
he's very supercharged fan.

635
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:13,020
He's passionate about about
what he's doing and he's
part of the moment for sure.

636
00:36:13,021 --> 00:36:15,810
Because in some ways, in some ways
he's part of the problem. Yeah,

637
00:36:16,130 --> 00:36:20,010
I liked the guy a lot,
but he, his uh, I believe,

638
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,840
I agree with him on a lot of what he says,

639
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:25,380
but what I don't agree with them
about is environmental concerns.

640
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:28,470
If he doesn't have very many
environmental concerns, he's is,

641
00:36:28,471 --> 00:36:31,610
as long as people are making
money, he's fine with it. You know?

642
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:32,780
That's unfortunate.
Well,

643
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:35,910
it just feels like it's just a few
small spots and don't worry about it.

644
00:36:36,090 --> 00:36:39,910
So a couple of spots get fucked up. We're
going to have regulation. Yeah. We seen,

645
00:36:40,410 --> 00:36:44,610
can you say a BP oil spill? Like that's
what happens. Well, it's interesting. I,

646
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:47,130
like I said, I really liked the guy
and I'd like a lot of his thoughts,

647
00:36:47,131 --> 00:36:51,240
but he was, he believed in somethings
that I agree with. Like the no,

648
00:36:51,241 --> 00:36:55,020
banks are too big to fail and they should
have like let the banks fail and that

649
00:36:55,021 --> 00:36:56,190
at the end of all that,

650
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:58,920
obviously I'm no economist by
any stretch to the imagination,

651
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:03,480
but I agree with his reasoning that
any system that doesn't work should be

652
00:37:03,481 --> 00:37:06,300
allowed to fail. And there's
nothing that's too big to fail.

653
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:09,030
But then when we started talking
about BP, you know, it's like,

654
00:37:09,330 --> 00:37:13,410
I think personally like he was talking
about if BP went under like what that

655
00:37:13,411 --> 00:37:14,970
would do to everybody and I said,

656
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:19,080
well I think what they did is way worse
than a cut a company going on there.

657
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:24,320
What they did was they ruined a part of
the ocean are really big part for a long

658
00:37:24,961 --> 00:37:28,620
time and it might still be ruined.
It might be ruined forever. I mean,

659
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:32,130
who knows what kind of devastating
effect it had on the marine life,

660
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:35,940
Dolphin life. If you had to put
all the death that was caused,

661
00:37:35,941 --> 00:37:38,700
all the destruction that was caused,
all the people that are getting sick,

662
00:37:38,701 --> 00:37:41,400
trying to clean that place up.
If you had to really put a number on it,

663
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,330
of course they shouldn't
be around anymore.

664
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:47,520
But his argument was that BP was too big
to fail. And I found that fascinating.

665
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:49,410
So disgusting.
Joe.

666
00:37:49,411 --> 00:37:53,610
I was down there covering it for a month
in New Orleans for CNN and I'm a huge

667
00:37:53,611 --> 00:37:57,390
fan of the ocean.
I an avid scuba diver and um,

668
00:37:57,420 --> 00:38:02,310
and just witnessing the oil, oil soaked
pelicans diving down into the oil,

669
00:38:02,311 --> 00:38:04,650
actually having the water be your enemy.

670
00:38:04,651 --> 00:38:08,220
We were on the boat and it was like 90
degrees outside and when the water would

671
00:38:08,221 --> 00:38:12,000
splash up on us, instead of it being
refreshing, I had to wipe it off my body.

672
00:38:12,001 --> 00:38:13,140
Like it was a poison.

673
00:38:13,170 --> 00:38:18,170
And I was so horrific that that month
of covering that I've even had to,

674
00:38:18,871 --> 00:38:23,400
you know, through my
psychedelic experiences, I've
even processed some of that,

675
00:38:23,401 --> 00:38:24,840
some of those implicit memories,

676
00:38:24,841 --> 00:38:27,020
these horrific memories
of that spill that we're,

677
00:38:27,021 --> 00:38:29,040
we're stuck in the back of my son.

678
00:38:29,570 --> 00:38:33,560
Yeah. And people could say,
oh, she's being manager, Matt,
I'll Peter Schiff, you. Oh,

679
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:37,000
so really, you poor baby, you have
a hard time. Cause the dirty water,

680
00:38:37,090 --> 00:38:40,480
the dirty water made you cry.
The dirty water fuck with your brain.

681
00:38:40,870 --> 00:38:45,220
But it's gotta be a weird moment as a
reporter being one of the first few people

682
00:38:45,221 --> 00:38:49,510
that's allowed to sort of go out there
and boats and experience it and report on

683
00:38:49,511 --> 00:38:53,200
it that you, you know, you got
a pretty big responsibility.

684
00:38:53,201 --> 00:38:56,380
You're getting to see some
shit that people, most people,

685
00:38:56,381 --> 00:38:57,730
most people are not going to go to it.

686
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:00,370
Most people in this country that are
experiencing and are experiencing it

687
00:39:00,371 --> 00:39:03,640
through you or through someone like you,
that's their reporting on it.

688
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:05,230
That had to be pretty intense.

689
00:39:05,490 --> 00:39:05,900
That,

690
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:10,900
and also seeing the distraction man can
cause on this earth firsthand was just

691
00:39:11,341 --> 00:39:12,380
really,
uh,

692
00:39:12,410 --> 00:39:15,990
just you see that kind of feeling because
when you look out and as far as you

693
00:39:15,991 --> 00:39:16,261
can see,

694
00:39:16,261 --> 00:39:20,790
you just see oil and crap and in this
beautiful ocean just ruined like that.

695
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:25,020
I mean, it just took a matter of days.
Uh, you just really realize, wow,

696
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:28,770
we really do have the capability
to completely destroy this planet.

697
00:39:28,830 --> 00:39:31,200
And it gives you,
especially journalists,

698
00:39:31,210 --> 00:39:35,100
delete and extra sense to make sure
to cover more environmental issues and

699
00:39:35,101 --> 00:39:39,900
investigate these corporations because
when left to their own devices, uh, you,

700
00:39:39,901 --> 00:39:40,800
you see what happens.

701
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:41,151
Yeah.

702
00:39:41,151 --> 00:39:46,151
You can't allow some thing that lives
off profit to not have oversight.

703
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:49,340
You just can't. You
can't, it'll just, it'll,

704
00:39:49,341 --> 00:39:53,060
and it'll probably kill the oversight
guy. They probably figured out, I mean,

705
00:39:53,061 --> 00:39:54,890
that's what happens. Yeah. You know,

706
00:39:54,891 --> 00:39:57,680
it happens in a lot of environments
where there's a lot of money involved.

707
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,930
Things get real fucking squirrely.
People just disappeared. Yeah.

708
00:40:01,610 --> 00:40:04,620
Whenever Johnny saw, well, we'll
just get rid of Johnny. I mean,

709
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:08,900
who knows how many people have
disappeared right in here. The reasons.

710
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:13,370
I mean this is probably, well I
don't know if there's a, uh, it's,

711
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:16,850
I dunno if there's a running number,
was probably a few of them that just,

712
00:40:16,851 --> 00:40:19,910
they got away with. I mean, if
they're doing it for this long,

713
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:22,910
getting rid of people to
get in the way of profit.

714
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:25,420
Of course people have done that.
If people are willing to,

715
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:27,770
that's the weird thing
that people don't want to,

716
00:40:27,771 --> 00:40:31,680
I'm in a lot of folks that no
nonsense type folks that I, I, I,

717
00:40:31,681 --> 00:40:35,960
I categorize certain types of skeptics
and there's some no nonsense skeptics.

718
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:40,250
They don't even realize that they're
sort of almost in a religion and their

719
00:40:40,251 --> 00:40:44,150
religion is debunking everything.
Their religion is calling bullshit.

720
00:40:44,151 --> 00:40:47,540
They love calling bullshit and even
calling bullshit when it doesn't even make

721
00:40:47,541 --> 00:40:51,320
any sense. Like when you start talking
about false flag attack, oh, bullshit,

722
00:40:51,321 --> 00:40:54,080
bullshit, bullshit, bullshit.
They love calling bullshit.

723
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:58,310
Do you really think that the government
would plan an attack and blah, blah, blah,

724
00:40:58,340 --> 00:41:02,030
or this or that, or lifted. And
then you start proposing, okay,

725
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:06,320
well what do you think happened when they
did that in the Gulf of Tonkin? What,

726
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:07,700
what do you think happened there?

727
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,580
Ah,
there's

728
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:13,460
nothing. They can't say anything. You know
what they did? You know what they did?

729
00:41:13,461 --> 00:41:16,430
They lied and they got people
to go to war because of the lie.

730
00:41:16,431 --> 00:41:18,490
Like it's been done.
Human beings not,

731
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:21,230
I'm not blaming the current administration
for what happened during the Vietnam

732
00:41:21,231 --> 00:41:24,380
War. I'm saying human beings
have shown time and time again.

733
00:41:24,381 --> 00:41:27,350
They're willing to do that.
They're willing to lie.

734
00:41:27,650 --> 00:41:31,250
And who knows how many lives are
going to be co wasted in this lie.

735
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:33,620
But they're more than willing to if it,
so yeah.

736
00:41:33,790 --> 00:41:38,560
Oh, for sure. You know, and that's even
a situation I had, uh, when I was at CNN,

737
00:41:38,561 --> 00:41:41,930
a lot of people had known that lies,
we're going on air and,

738
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,690
and that this was happening, but they
continued to work there for money,

739
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:50,590
you know, and they, I
mean, it just, like I said,

740
00:41:50,591 --> 00:41:52,480
sometimes money comes first.

741
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:53,501
Yeah.

742
00:41:53,501 --> 00:41:58,480
Unfortunately or fortunately because
the good thing about what's going on in

743
00:41:58,540 --> 00:42:01,870
Colorado and Washington is money.
That's the good thing.

744
00:42:01,930 --> 00:42:05,980
And if money truly does come first, maybe
that will be a big part of the shift.

745
00:42:06,310 --> 00:42:10,390
Maybe the people insistent on their
freedom or are one part of it.

746
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:12,160
But then along the way,

747
00:42:12,850 --> 00:42:15,790
the money people get cooptive as well
because they become addicted to that

748
00:42:15,791 --> 00:42:19,720
marijuana money and they won't let the
government shut off the pipe. Exactly.

749
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:23,110
I mean, it does seem to
make sense. And so, um,

750
00:42:23,470 --> 00:42:28,300
you have this one experience. You, you'd
go down there, you take the IOWASCA.

751
00:42:28,330 --> 00:42:29,820
How many,
how many different trips did you go on?

752
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:34,690
Um, I w I did seven,
so I, um, I went down,

753
00:42:34,691 --> 00:42:37,780
I, uh, I was feeling really
stressed out and life.

754
00:42:37,781 --> 00:42:42,781
I just had a bunch of crazy shit happened
to me throughout my career and it was

755
00:42:44,021 --> 00:42:48,240
just one, uh, experience after the
other and I just hadn't had time. Uh,

756
00:42:48,250 --> 00:42:51,310
I had this bottled up trauma like so
many of us are carrying around. I,

757
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:56,280
I hadn't had time to process it. And
so I remember you telling me, um,

758
00:42:56,350 --> 00:42:59,530
I had written you after the podcast about,
uh,

759
00:42:59,590 --> 00:43:01,240
mushrooms because I
looked up silicide been,

760
00:43:01,241 --> 00:43:05,090
and I could not believe all the lies
we've been fed about magic mushrooms. How,

761
00:43:05,091 --> 00:43:05,290
I mean,

762
00:43:05,290 --> 00:43:08,710
I mean silicide been is single handedly
one of the most incredible healing

763
00:43:08,711 --> 00:43:13,180
chemicals for the brain. Uh, some people
call it 30 years of therapy in one night.

764
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:16,000
And so I looked up psilocybin and then a,
you,

765
00:43:16,090 --> 00:43:19,300
I'd written you and you'd
recommended, uh, trying IOWASCA.

766
00:43:19,870 --> 00:43:21,700
And so I kind of kept that
in the back of my mind.

767
00:43:22,090 --> 00:43:26,570
And then when I got to this point
in the spring where I felt like, um,

768
00:43:26,650 --> 00:43:30,370
I was having so much anxiety,
constant butterflies in my stomach,

769
00:43:30,371 --> 00:43:32,170
I couldn't sleep,
I couldn't eat.

770
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:37,300
It was like I was in an
anxiety purgatory. And, um,

771
00:43:37,330 --> 00:43:38,440
and something in my brain.

772
00:43:38,441 --> 00:43:42,910
I just remembered that email and I
remember reading all this positive, uh,

773
00:43:42,940 --> 00:43:47,160
research and studies about a IOWASCA
and other psychedelics helping with, uh,

774
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:49,360
anxiety and post traumatic
stress disorders.

775
00:43:49,810 --> 00:43:54,810
And I just knew I had it had to go down
to the jungle and I didn't even prepare.

776
00:43:55,331 --> 00:43:59,740
I just bought a ticket and went down two
days later because I was so out of it

777
00:43:59,741 --> 00:44:02,920
at the time that I didn't
even have time to pack.

778
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:08,260
I remember pulling into
Los Angeles International
Airport and parking lot. See,

779
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:10,450
and I don't even know how I
found my way to the airport.

780
00:44:10,450 --> 00:44:14,500
It was just like this magnet was
drawing me to the jungle. Um,

781
00:44:14,530 --> 00:44:19,530
and because I was so anxious and
had so much adrenaline rushing in,

782
00:44:20,161 --> 00:44:24,790
in so many flashbacks happening that
it was really hard to even drive. Um,

783
00:44:25,210 --> 00:44:27,310
and I was sitting in the
parking lot scene and I'm in my,

784
00:44:27,490 --> 00:44:30,970
the back of my car and I'm packing this
backpack I find in my trunk and I'm

785
00:44:31,350 --> 00:44:34,920
maybe a dirty sock under the seat and
Oh wait, I'm headed to the jungle.

786
00:44:34,921 --> 00:44:36,000
I think I need a flashlight.

787
00:44:36,001 --> 00:44:39,930
So I went into my glove box and I found
this little menu readers that senior

788
00:44:39,931 --> 00:44:43,470
citizens get the, my grandma
ordered from me on Qvc, um,

789
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:48,500
and through that in my bag and just grab
this backpack and was standing there

790
00:44:48,990 --> 00:44:53,610
waiting for the bus. Joe. And I remember
looking up at this Guy Thinking,

791
00:44:53,670 --> 00:44:57,960
oh my God, if there's a rock
bottom in life, I've, I've hit it.

792
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:01,920
And, um, and just thinking that
there's, there's no way out.

793
00:45:01,921 --> 00:45:05,460
Like I Iowaska,
I mean this is my last hope.

794
00:45:06,090 --> 00:45:10,020
And um,
and so I get on the plane and I'm,

795
00:45:10,021 --> 00:45:14,670
I'm heading down there,
um, and just, uh, you know,

796
00:45:14,671 --> 00:45:16,320
looking over the jungle,
I was by myself.

797
00:45:16,321 --> 00:45:17,580
I didn't know where the hell I was going.

798
00:45:17,581 --> 00:45:22,290
I just found this center online really
quickly and I'm sitting there drinking a

799
00:45:22,291 --> 00:45:27,270
glass of wine, looking out it just
this vast array of Amazon jungle.

800
00:45:27,570 --> 00:45:30,270
I'm completely unprepared.
I don't know what the hell I'm doing.

801
00:45:30,271 --> 00:45:33,060
I don't even know what Ios get is.
I didn't read up on it beforehand.

802
00:45:33,510 --> 00:45:36,240
I just felt a calling. It was
weird. A lot of people tell me this,

803
00:45:36,241 --> 00:45:39,470
you feel a calling to do it.
It's like the medicine telling you it,

804
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:43,860
it can heal you. And um, and then, uh,

805
00:45:43,950 --> 00:45:47,430
and then we landed and I remember,
um,

806
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:50,550
I had my sunglasses on still cause I,
I was just a mess.

807
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:55,110
And I remember seeing this guy sitting
behind me and he kept looking through the

808
00:45:55,111 --> 00:45:57,690
airplane seats at me and I was like,
what is this creep doing?

809
00:45:57,691 --> 00:46:01,380
Like I must look like shit because
he will not quit looking at me.

810
00:46:02,010 --> 00:46:06,660
And right when we get up, he comes
up, he's like, are you Amber Lyon?

811
00:46:07,230 --> 00:46:08,670
And I was like,
fuck,

812
00:46:09,090 --> 00:46:12,390
like the only time in my life where I
don't want to be recognized where I want

813
00:46:12,391 --> 00:46:17,370
to completely disappear from the world.
This guy, uh, this guy recognizes me.

814
00:46:17,430 --> 00:46:21,830
So, um, we ended up becoming good friends
who's now my business partner. But um,

815
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:27,270
but uh, yeah, the whole plane was all
headed to this same retreat center,

816
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:31,790
which was about a two hour ride
into the Amazon and, and so,

817
00:46:34,550 --> 00:46:37,620
um, it was a small jet, but
yeah, no propellers. Yeah,

818
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:40,650
propellers freaked me out because I'm
always worried maybe a bird's going to get

819
00:46:40,651 --> 00:46:43,440
caught in there or, you
know, so it was, uh,

820
00:46:43,620 --> 00:46:47,700
it was just a small jet about 20 seats
and everyone on there were gringos.

821
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:51,240
So when we're never, you go to Iquitos,
Peru, and you see Gringos, you know,

822
00:46:51,241 --> 00:46:53,670
that they're most likely there
for IOWASCA tourism. I mean,

823
00:46:53,671 --> 00:46:57,270
why else would they be
there? And uh, and so, uh,

824
00:46:57,271 --> 00:47:02,271
so we flew into ketosis and then it was
me and five guys and they were all going

825
00:47:03,811 --> 00:47:06,390
to the same center. So I was really
relieved because I was like, okay,

826
00:47:06,391 --> 00:47:10,410
at least I know these guys and
they seem fairly trustworthy.

827
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:15,800
And then we got on a boat and traveled
two hours up the Amazon and just entered

828
00:47:16,111 --> 00:47:20,460
in this area of forest where you just saw
this little hut and it was the name of

829
00:47:20,461 --> 00:47:25,140
this healing center. And,
um, and yeah, that's it.

830
00:47:25,890 --> 00:47:29,080
And that was, um, that was really
creepy. I guess. I was like,

831
00:47:29,081 --> 00:47:33,580
this looks like a place that people don't
return from, but it, but at that point,

832
00:47:33,581 --> 00:47:36,190
I,
I knew that I had no choice,

833
00:47:36,191 --> 00:47:40,720
like I had to try this
medicine. And so, um, so,

834
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:45,370
so I went, you know, I just thought
this fear was resistance to healing.

835
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:48,890
And so I, I dealt with
the fear and, and dove in,

836
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:50,360
that's like a scene in a movie.

837
00:47:50,690 --> 00:47:54,130
Yeah, it was, it was,
um, it was really, yeah,

838
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:58,300
the new altered states could be about
a woman who goes to the Amazon that was

839
00:47:58,301 --> 00:48:00,420
like, that would be, you know,

840
00:48:01,380 --> 00:48:04,980
the whole thing from grabbing like dirty
socks and you just throw them in your

841
00:48:04,981 --> 00:48:09,090
bag, whatever you got, just
what a flashlight running,
leaving your car behind.

842
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:12,270
And, and then I had to, you know, now that
a couple of people would recognize me,

843
00:48:12,271 --> 00:48:16,050
I had to kind of try to put myself
together when I really wanted to just lay

844
00:48:16,051 --> 00:48:20,940
back and just, just be, and um,
then at that point I had to,

845
00:48:20,970 --> 00:48:25,050
I was like, I can't let these people
know like, why I'm really here. You know,

846
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:28,800
I'm just here as a journalist. I'm just
here to write about these medicines.

847
00:48:28,801 --> 00:48:33,420
I don't really need them. And,
um, and really the, you know,

848
00:48:33,421 --> 00:48:34,460
I was putting on this,

849
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:37,890
this face that everything was all
good and I was here journalistically,

850
00:48:37,891 --> 00:48:41,140
but really inside I was
just torn to shreds and,

851
00:48:41,170 --> 00:48:45,360
and really hoping to God that
this medicine was going to work

852
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:47,970
well. That's where the skeptic
would come in and say, well,

853
00:48:48,270 --> 00:48:51,060
you have to realize this
is a placebo effect.

854
00:48:51,061 --> 00:48:56,061
The psychosomatic nature of your
incident led you to have a very stressful

855
00:48:56,431 --> 00:48:59,310
reaction to what was
essentially just hallucinations.

856
00:48:59,311 --> 00:49:04,311
And you've connected all this spiritual
Mumbo jumbo will bullshit to you,

857
00:49:04,981 --> 00:49:06,090
tripping your balls off.

858
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:09,030
Well, I would say the
science disagrees with them.

859
00:49:09,031 --> 00:49:10,980
And then thousands and
thousands of anecdotes.

860
00:49:10,981 --> 00:49:12,500
There's not a lot of scientific research.

861
00:49:12,501 --> 00:49:15,780
Do you have to also go with the anecdotes,
which I think are just as powerful.

862
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:19,500
But the science actually shows that
when you go to these IOWASCA churches in

863
00:49:19,501 --> 00:49:22,710
Brazil, like the UDV or
Santo Dom a church, they, uh,

864
00:49:22,711 --> 00:49:27,390
the members of these church who drink
Ayahuasca regularly actually have improved

865
00:49:27,391 --> 00:49:29,280
levels of Serotonin in their brain.

866
00:49:29,490 --> 00:49:33,810
So a lot of these healers believe it
actually restructures your serotonergic

867
00:49:33,811 --> 00:49:38,370
system, which allows you to part
with this depression and anxiety.

868
00:49:38,670 --> 00:49:39,720
It's also,
um,

869
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:44,610
some Shamans I've dealt with say that
what the IOWASCA does as it gets in your

870
00:49:44,611 --> 00:49:47,840
soul and gets rid of these
dark energies and, um,

871
00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:51,510
painful events that have been holding
you back and that might manifest

872
00:49:51,511 --> 00:49:55,500
themselves in anxiety or
depression or in bodily pain.

873
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:59,490
And so if you, if you look
at that research, there is a,

874
00:49:59,491 --> 00:50:02,250
there are thousands of
anecdotes of people saying,

875
00:50:02,251 --> 00:50:07,010
I'm including myself saying that this,
this medicine, uh, worked for them. And,

876
00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:10,590
and I, you Osca is a medicine.
It behaves like a medicine.

877
00:50:10,591 --> 00:50:12,810
The more you take of it.
Uh,

878
00:50:12,990 --> 00:50:17,730
the less you need and actually behaves
like a medicine should and cures,

879
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:21,570
uh, whatever's wrong with
you. Um, for me it did.

880
00:50:22,210 --> 00:50:24,870
It doesn't track spiritually.
You are,

881
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:28,040
you are your connections that
you've made in your mind. It resets

882
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:28,370
them.

883
00:50:28,370 --> 00:50:31,640
And then oftentimes that is how we react
to things is based on our connections.

884
00:50:32,030 --> 00:50:35,710
You know, our past can really
completely flavor our future because it,

885
00:50:35,711 --> 00:50:39,050
it changes the way you behave and
the way you interact with people.

886
00:50:39,290 --> 00:50:41,580
And when you do that,
you change the nature well,

887
00:50:41,581 --> 00:50:43,760
you change the nature of the
interactions that you had with people.

888
00:50:43,830 --> 00:50:46,780
Do you change the directions that
things are going to go in? You know,

889
00:50:46,810 --> 00:50:51,740
I mean many people, if you put them in
one situation, um, no fight takes place,

890
00:50:51,890 --> 00:50:52,760
but many other people,

891
00:50:52,761 --> 00:50:55,840
you put them in the exact same situation
and it turns into murder. Yeah.

892
00:50:56,010 --> 00:50:58,250
I mean that's,
it's really,

893
00:50:58,490 --> 00:51:02,120
it's a lot of it is our connections
to how, what, what we've,

894
00:51:02,121 --> 00:51:06,050
we've made in our life and
we don't realize how much
those sort of hold us back

895
00:51:06,051 --> 00:51:09,040
until a psychedelic experience.
And to the,

896
00:51:09,180 --> 00:51:12,380
to the Naysayer people like
your very important, you know,

897
00:51:12,381 --> 00:51:14,690
the skeptical people that say,
oh, it's just the hallucinations.

898
00:51:14,691 --> 00:51:17,570
You're attaching all this shit to it.
This is what you have to realize.

899
00:51:17,571 --> 00:51:20,540
And I've said this so many times, I don't
even wanna hear myself say it again,

900
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:24,650
but it's, it's really important
whether or not it's a hallucination,

901
00:51:24,651 --> 00:51:28,070
whether or not it's all in
your imagination or whether
or not you were really

902
00:51:28,071 --> 00:51:29,480
having an experience.

903
00:51:29,660 --> 00:51:33,350
We are meeting divine wisdom and it's
giving you advice and love and showing you

904
00:51:33,351 --> 00:51:36,350
a new way.
Whichever one of those it is,

905
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:41,420
it's the exact same experience.
You are having the exact same experience.

906
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:44,660
So it doesn't matter if you choose
to look at it one way that it's a

907
00:51:44,661 --> 00:51:47,210
hallucination,
it's a product of your imagination.

908
00:51:47,390 --> 00:51:50,390
Or if you choose to look at it the other
way and say, Oh my God, I'm, I'm, uh,

909
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:54,830
meeting the divine wisdom of the universe
and now I'm humbled by this and I'm

910
00:51:54,831 --> 00:51:58,070
going to be a better person because of it.
This experience is exactly the same.

911
00:51:58,310 --> 00:52:01,520
It's on how you choose to apply
it to your life. You know,

912
00:52:01,521 --> 00:52:05,480
just people don't want the no nonsense
people. They don't want to be fools.

913
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:06,740
They don't want to talk about,

914
00:52:06,860 --> 00:52:09,410
they don't want to be the heaven's gate
people chopping their balls off and

915
00:52:09,411 --> 00:52:11,540
wearing the purple Nike's.
They don't want to be that guy.

916
00:52:11,750 --> 00:52:15,890
So because of their limiting, there's
this, it's almost like an ego thing.

917
00:52:15,891 --> 00:52:20,240
Like they know they don't want to fall
prey to some foolishness and then have

918
00:52:20,241 --> 00:52:23,960
other people pick apart. You know what
they've done? Like, look at this dummy.

919
00:52:24,110 --> 00:52:27,830
He thought that Colin had taken Iowasca
is going to connect them to the universe.

920
00:52:27,831 --> 00:52:28,830
Yeah.
All Right Bob.

921
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:30,170
Wait a go pow.

922
00:52:30,250 --> 00:52:35,250
You know the ego fighting
back and resisting entering
that dimension whatsoever.

923
00:52:35,550 --> 00:52:36,570
If you go there,
right

924
00:52:36,610 --> 00:52:38,200
and then you think it's nonsense,

925
00:52:38,290 --> 00:52:42,100
then we should talk because I got to
know what your thought process on it is

926
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:46,330
because everyone that I know that's had,
especially the DMT experience,

927
00:52:46,331 --> 00:52:47,740
which have you had,
have you done that yet?

928
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:50,520
Uh, no. But I had an Iowaska experience.

929
00:52:50,521 --> 00:52:54,210
It was very similar to what people have
described having when they smoked DMT.

930
00:52:54,211 --> 00:52:57,930
I'd been fasting for five days
and had this Kambo frog medicine,

931
00:52:57,931 --> 00:52:59,940
which really detoxifies you.

932
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:03,350
So I was ready just to absorb the DMT and,

933
00:53:03,370 --> 00:53:08,370
and I went where a lot of people have
described with smoking DMT on the Iowasca.

934
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:09,890
Well

935
00:53:09,890 --> 00:53:13,640
it's for folks who don't know Iowasca
and DMT essentially are the same drug.

936
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:18,080
It's just a DMT is not orally active
cause your brain produces your body rather

937
00:53:18,081 --> 00:53:20,270
produces something called model,
a amine oxidase,

938
00:53:20,540 --> 00:53:23,450
which breaks down
dimethyltryptamine in an oral form.

939
00:53:23,660 --> 00:53:26,010
So they figured out how to do something

940
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:27,510
where they have the plant.

941
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:32,820
One plant has DMT in it and
another plant has a harming,

942
00:53:32,821 --> 00:53:35,490
which is a natural m a o inhibitor.

943
00:53:35,491 --> 00:53:37,860
And they mix the two of them
together and break it down.

944
00:53:37,861 --> 00:53:40,680
And no one knows how they figured
out how to do this either.

945
00:53:40,681 --> 00:53:43,170
This has been done for thousands
and thousands of years.

946
00:53:43,171 --> 00:53:47,220
The fact that in the hundred
plus thousand plants,

947
00:53:47,221 --> 00:53:49,740
they chose these two
what's the most effective?

948
00:53:49,950 --> 00:53:52,340
And they use different ones in other
cultures too though, right? The right,

949
00:53:52,341 --> 00:53:53,010
the one thing,

950
00:53:53,010 --> 00:53:56,970
different types of plants that have the
same sort of ingredients like different

951
00:53:57,270 --> 00:54:01,070
plants that are very rich and DMT
and plants that are very rich and uh,

952
00:54:01,210 --> 00:54:03,380
and harming or some something sooner.

953
00:54:03,590 --> 00:54:05,240
You can mix different types of,

954
00:54:05,270 --> 00:54:09,050
of leaves as long as they have DMT with
the Iowasca because what the Iowasca

955
00:54:09,051 --> 00:54:13,850
does is just help your body absorb that
DMT. So, uh, particularly where I went,

956
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:16,090
they use Chacruna leaves,
uh,

957
00:54:16,230 --> 00:54:19,490
and mix that with the Iowasca that
they had growing on the ground.

958
00:54:19,491 --> 00:54:23,460
So we actually got to watch them make
it, which was pretty exciting. Um,

959
00:54:23,750 --> 00:54:24,620
knowing that I had

960
00:54:24,990 --> 00:54:29,950
no idea what I was in store for,
you probably thought

961
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:34,020
it was going to be like a
little bit of bullshit. Right?

962
00:54:34,470 --> 00:54:35,303
I,
I,

963
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:40,020
I was so desperate at that point that I
didn't know what to expect. Like I said,

964
00:54:40,021 --> 00:54:44,610
I just was a calling to go down
there and, and do it. And, and, um,

965
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:49,290
some Shamans I've talked to said that the
medicine often does that to people who

966
00:54:49,291 --> 00:54:53,010
really need it. They just feel
this desire to go down and try it.

967
00:54:53,011 --> 00:54:56,160
And they just feel this. They just
know that it's going to help them.

968
00:54:56,161 --> 00:54:57,570
And that's what,
that's what I had.

969
00:54:57,670 --> 00:54:59,820
It sounds like bullshit.
I know this,

970
00:54:59,890 --> 00:55:04,330
unless you've actually had a real
psychedelic experience and then you know,

971
00:55:04,331 --> 00:55:07,450
any of them, whether it's a strong
mushroom experience or whatever it is,

972
00:55:07,660 --> 00:55:11,170
when you realize like, oh, okay, no one
knows what the hell's going on like this,

973
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:14,970
this, this shouldn't might very well
be calling you. It very well might be.

974
00:55:15,070 --> 00:55:17,900
And, and there was a, so when
I got there, it's just me in a,

975
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:22,730
and about 12 dudes and that's
it, right? Yeah. So once again,

976
00:55:22,731 --> 00:55:24,710
I wouldn't recommend, uh, for females.

977
00:55:24,711 --> 00:55:27,770
I recommend you always go down with
a friend. Don't follow my example.

978
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:30,290
This is the reason a very, um, uh,

979
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:33,530
responsible amber lions in the disclaimer.

980
00:55:33,590 --> 00:55:37,880
I just don't have a high level of fear,
so I was able to go down by myself.

981
00:55:37,900 --> 00:55:42,110
But every weapon, do you have
prison shank? Nothing. No.

982
00:55:42,111 --> 00:55:43,650
No weapon.
No days.

983
00:55:43,651 --> 00:55:47,710
Or could you imagine the showman comes
up and starts like blowing Agua Florida

984
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:49,190
on you and you just get away

985
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:56,340
from them when you have a
hammer? Everything looks
like a nail, but I'll get it.

986
00:55:56,350 --> 00:56:00,330
I mean, I had, I did have a bad
experience with my showman the first, uh,

987
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:04,760
the first night and that's why I don't
recommend women go down or an experience

988
00:56:04,761 --> 00:56:06,980
where you Shama is trying
to hook up with you. Um, no,

989
00:56:06,981 --> 00:56:10,990
he just inappropriately touched
me during the ceremony and now

990
00:56:11,940 --> 00:56:15,620
the time I didn't know
that it wasn't okay. And I,

991
00:56:16,300 --> 00:56:18,460
well, what do you, because you're under,

992
00:56:18,490 --> 00:56:21,910
you're under the influence
of the Iowa Scott. Oh,

993
00:56:21,911 --> 00:56:24,870
so you were in the middle of
tripping. Yeah. He touched you.

994
00:56:24,950 --> 00:56:27,440
Yeah.
So to tell you the whole story,

995
00:56:27,441 --> 00:56:31,130
so this was our first night really
doing the medicine I, the night before.

996
00:56:31,131 --> 00:56:34,910
They had just given us just a little
bit so we could kind of get used to the

997
00:56:34,911 --> 00:56:37,910
creepiness cause the whole thing
is creepier in this yogurt,

998
00:56:38,170 --> 00:56:40,250
in the middle of the jungle
laying on these yoga mats,

999
00:56:40,251 --> 00:56:43,820
you have this huge bucket next
to you just to take out there.

1000
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:48,690
I mean imagine that Joe going
into that each night and um, and,

1001
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:51,860
and so the whole thing is super creepy
so you have to get used to that.

1002
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:54,860
And then the next night we actually
were able to take our full dose and of

1003
00:56:54,861 --> 00:56:59,570
course there's the bed that we laid on
and our buckets cause you just violently

1004
00:56:59,571 --> 00:57:01,580
vomit.
Most people do kind of out of both.

1005
00:57:01,610 --> 00:57:05,560
That's all you get for a bucket.
I think I would need a bigger boat.

1006
00:57:05,590 --> 00:57:07,890
Oh there I am laying right there.
So I was kind of in the front,

1007
00:57:08,020 --> 00:57:12,640
the circle. And you see there's about
12 people around this year at ESC, um,

1008
00:57:12,730 --> 00:57:17,230
area. And, uh, and with
the bucket in the vomiting,

1009
00:57:17,231 --> 00:57:20,470
they actually call it getting well
because you're pulling out all your toxins

1010
00:57:20,471 --> 00:57:25,180
and all this negative dark energy
that Western medicine tends to ignore.

1011
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:28,750
The IOWASCA is actually getting to the
bottom of, of the core of that. So,

1012
00:57:28,751 --> 00:57:33,630
so they consider this violent vomiting
and um, some people out the other end, uh,

1013
00:57:33,940 --> 00:57:35,020
to be really good

1014
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:36,680
healing diarrhea.

1015
00:57:38,910 --> 00:57:43,470
I think it's appropriate for a woman to
say that. I don't know. That's ridiculous.

1016
00:57:43,770 --> 00:57:48,030
Okay. So people were taking massive shifts
and they were vomiting part of life.

1017
00:57:48,060 --> 00:57:49,440
It's part of like you can't deny it.

1018
00:57:52,810 --> 00:57:55,120
I am.
So I was the first one all day.

1019
00:57:55,121 --> 00:57:58,420
We'd been sitting around the table at
lunch like how much are you going to take?

1020
00:57:58,421 --> 00:58:02,080
The most you could take was a cup and
that was like the absolute send you to

1021
00:58:02,081 --> 00:58:05,590
another universe amount. And I'm,
and were all nervously like, okay,

1022
00:58:05,591 --> 00:58:08,440
well maybe we'll just take half a cup.
All of us together.

1023
00:58:08,470 --> 00:58:09,730
We'll take a fourth cup.

1024
00:58:10,180 --> 00:58:13,390
And I went up there and I was the
first one to go up in this group.

1025
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:17,370
And something just told me, you need
to take the full cup. So I said, okay,

1026
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:21,540
I'll take a cup. And I looked
around all the guys in the circle,

1027
00:58:21,541 --> 00:58:25,860
we're just like, oh shit. Cause now
they had to take a cup too, you know,

1028
00:58:25,861 --> 00:58:26,390
they didn't want to

1029
00:58:26,390 --> 00:58:29,110
seem like [inaudible] and uh,

1030
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:34,320
and so I drank this mixture and it tasted
like coffee mixed with cough syrup to

1031
00:58:35,261 --> 00:58:38,020
the point where you just
like gag right away.

1032
00:58:38,770 --> 00:58:43,270
And then went and sat back
on my mat and then, uh,

1033
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:47,020
about 20 minutes later it started
taking effect and it just,

1034
00:58:47,380 --> 00:58:52,030
the noise of the crickets outside in the
jungle got louder and louder and louder.

1035
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:56,380
And I could hear people all around me
just violently getting sick to the depths

1036
00:58:56,381 --> 00:59:01,160
of their soul, like, oh, like
gut wrenching, throwing up and,

1037
00:59:01,340 --> 00:59:04,660
and I just laid back. And, and then

1038
00:59:04,710 --> 00:59:07,920
where are they diarrhea? Do they use
the other bucket? I have a photo of it.

1039
00:59:07,921 --> 00:59:11,490
There's actually a bathroom. Um,
make it to the breath. It's funny,

1040
00:59:11,491 --> 00:59:15,690
like the diarrhea. There it is.
And that was when it was clean. I,

1041
00:59:15,990 --> 00:59:19,080
I gotta be honest with you sometimes
I've gone in there and it was the floors

1042
00:59:19,081 --> 00:59:22,070
were brown.
It just slipped

1043
00:59:22,070 --> 00:59:24,310
or they didn't, didn't care.
They were tripping their shit.

1044
00:59:26,300 --> 00:59:30,440
I would just go out into the jungle
and a lot of people did, but,

1045
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:34,460
but some people that would suck,
some people they were scared to,

1046
00:59:34,461 --> 00:59:37,670
they had to have armed guards outside
and in Garth's watching people,

1047
00:59:37,671 --> 00:59:40,580
cause people would go and walk away into
the jungle and you don't want to get

1048
00:59:40,581 --> 00:59:41,810
lost in that state.

1049
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:46,150
So that was something that people
were really cognizant of. And,

1050
00:59:46,210 --> 00:59:50,790
and so that's why a lot of people went
into the bathroom. That was their fight.

1051
00:59:50,810 --> 00:59:54,800
Um, yeah, it was, uh, it
was really powerful. Joe,

1052
00:59:54,801 --> 00:59:59,090
like I just laid back and um,
next thing I know, I just heard,

1053
00:59:59,091 --> 01:00:03,260
here we go and then it's that,
here we go.

1054
01:00:03,470 --> 01:00:07,040
And then Bam, I saw all
this shit, sacred geometry,

1055
01:00:07,041 --> 01:00:10,890
which is potentially the language of
communication of the universe. Um,

1056
01:00:11,180 --> 01:00:14,270
I saw all these ones and
zeros going across the screen.

1057
01:00:14,271 --> 01:00:17,630
I heard the sound of coins just
clicking clinking, clinking.

1058
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:19,970
I flew through a timeline of my life.

1059
01:00:19,971 --> 01:00:24,440
It was almost like the IOWASCA was trying
to get to know who I was and so I saw

1060
01:00:24,620 --> 01:00:28,730
pictures of me pop up on this three
d timeline from when I was 12, 10.

1061
01:00:28,731 --> 01:00:31,940
Then when I was born, and then a photo
of my parents before they conceive me.

1062
01:00:32,330 --> 01:00:36,560
And then, um, and then all of a
sudden on this big cement wall,

1063
01:00:36,561 --> 01:00:38,030
almost like the wall behind you,

1064
01:00:38,690 --> 01:00:42,440
it's spray painted the words
anxiety really, really big.

1065
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:45,980
And right then the medicine was telling
me that it had figured out what was

1066
01:00:45,981 --> 01:00:50,630
wrong with me and yeah. And it was
literally because I didn't know,

1067
01:00:50,631 --> 01:00:51,590
I couldn't pinpoint it.

1068
01:00:51,591 --> 01:00:54,890
I couldn't pinpoint because at the time
my thoughts were reasoning so much,

1069
01:00:54,891 --> 01:00:57,050
I couldn't really figure
out what was wrong.

1070
01:00:57,050 --> 01:01:01,010
And that's often a symptom of people
who have post traumatic stress disorder,

1071
01:01:01,011 --> 01:01:02,660
posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms.

1072
01:01:02,661 --> 01:01:06,380
There's just so much going on that you
can't even stop to think about, okay,

1073
01:01:06,381 --> 01:01:08,410
what could have caused this?
What's happening you,

1074
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:10,430
you just can't even stop to think.

1075
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:14,420
And I'm in the Iowasca clearly
told me your problem is anxiety.

1076
01:01:14,810 --> 01:01:19,810
And then right then I laid back and I
felt it crawling through my veins and up

1077
01:01:20,271 --> 01:01:23,510
into my head. And it almost
felt like a fizzing in my head.

1078
01:01:24,140 --> 01:01:27,740
And at that point it was telling me laid
back, we're going to take care of this.

1079
01:01:28,100 --> 01:01:30,010
And I felt like there were,
um,

1080
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:34,940
and this is a common vision that there
were all of these like thousands and

1081
01:01:34,940 --> 01:01:37,880
thousands of little beings
are elves on my body.

1082
01:01:38,060 --> 01:01:42,500
And they were literally going through
myself one by one and reshaping them and

1083
01:01:42,501 --> 01:01:43,340
perfecting them.

1084
01:01:44,030 --> 01:01:49,030
And the medicine above all just told
me to just lay back and let it work.

1085
01:01:49,640 --> 01:01:50,473
And um,

1086
01:01:50,590 --> 01:01:55,460
and then I laid there for probably about
an hour and then had a really powerful

1087
01:01:55,461 --> 01:02:00,461
vision after that of this like being this
like fairy type thing coming up to me

1088
01:02:02,421 --> 01:02:06,200
and then sucking out this dark energy.

1089
01:02:06,230 --> 01:02:10,940
And I saw all of this energy flowing
out of my body, these dark, uh,

1090
01:02:10,941 --> 01:02:15,920
I guess you'd call them spirits of people
who I'd interviewed over the years.

1091
01:02:16,430 --> 01:02:21,420
And what it was telling me was that as
a journalist been absorbing all of this

1092
01:02:21,421 --> 01:02:24,300
pain and had it just stored in my body.

1093
01:02:24,301 --> 01:02:27,210
And that was one of the things that was
manifesting itself in the post traumatic

1094
01:02:27,211 --> 01:02:28,044
stress disorder.

1095
01:02:28,230 --> 01:02:33,230
And so it was literally just sucking out
all of this dark energy that was shaped

1096
01:02:33,690 --> 01:02:37,230
in the forums of people I'd interviewed
and their faces over the years.

1097
01:02:37,860 --> 01:02:40,680
And um, and once it finished, I just

1098
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:45,930
felt like such a sigh of relief and like
a ton of bricks had been taken off off

1099
01:02:45,931 --> 01:02:50,780
my shoulders. And yeah,
it was so powerful. And,

1100
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:55,110
um, and, and I realized to, what it had
told me is that like journalistically,

1101
01:02:55,111 --> 01:02:58,740
some journalists,
and this is true with doctors and,

1102
01:02:59,100 --> 01:03:00,720
and other people who deal with,

1103
01:03:00,780 --> 01:03:04,830
are faced with trauma a lot is it some
journalists are able to put up a brick

1104
01:03:04,831 --> 01:03:07,740
wall and you kind of do your
story and then you move on.

1105
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:10,770
But for me to really understand
what I was reporting on,

1106
01:03:10,771 --> 01:03:15,771
I had to almost become the people I was
interviewing to really feel their pain,

1107
01:03:16,531 --> 01:03:19,140
to understand who was telling the truth.
What they were going through.

1108
01:03:19,141 --> 01:03:21,990
And that happened to me so many
times using submersion journalism,

1109
01:03:22,380 --> 01:03:26,760
but I didn't realize at the same time I
was also absorbing a lot of their pain.

1110
01:03:27,260 --> 01:03:30,690
Especially I'd done a lot of stories on
sex trafficking, child sex trafficking,

1111
01:03:30,691 --> 01:03:34,290
a lot of stories on drug addiction,
oxycodone, oxycontin addiction.

1112
01:03:34,770 --> 01:03:39,770
And when I'd sit with these people and
watch them shoot up oxycontin pills,

1113
01:03:40,530 --> 01:03:44,520
I was absorbing that pain because I would
sit and intensely watched them to try

1114
01:03:44,521 --> 01:03:46,500
to feel why are they
doing what they're doing.

1115
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:51,660
And so all of this was just stored in my
body and the IOWASCA was taking it out.

1116
01:03:54,320 --> 01:03:59,100
It seems like it would be really
beneficial for soldiers. Yes,

1117
01:03:59,130 --> 01:04:01,250
there are soldiers who've gone down.
Uh,

1118
01:04:01,290 --> 01:04:05,610
some scientists have actually followed
them down into the jungle and all 12 of

1119
01:04:05,611 --> 01:04:06,300
them that went,

1120
01:04:06,300 --> 01:04:10,170
came back reporting improved symptoms
of post traumatic stress disorder.

1121
01:04:11,250 --> 01:04:14,550
Because what I WASC is really good at
doing the way to cure post traumatic

1122
01:04:14,551 --> 01:04:17,910
stress disorder is you really need to
get into your subconscious or you have

1123
01:04:17,911 --> 01:04:20,820
these memories locked in there that
you don't even remember. You remember.

1124
01:04:21,180 --> 01:04:23,760
And you need to be able to
process them with a sound mind,

1125
01:04:24,030 --> 01:04:26,970
to detach the fear that's
associated with those memories.

1126
01:04:27,180 --> 01:04:30,240
So that next time anything that
triggers that memory comes up,

1127
01:04:30,360 --> 01:04:33,840
you're not flooded with
fear. Um, so for example,

1128
01:04:34,110 --> 01:04:37,170
anytime a soldier might hear a loud
noise that reminds them of the time they

1129
01:04:37,171 --> 01:04:39,390
were shot at in a tank,
and that's why they're,

1130
01:04:39,510 --> 01:04:42,060
they face this adrenaline rush
or a panic attack. Or for me,

1131
01:04:42,061 --> 01:04:43,860
it became even seeing,
um,

1132
01:04:44,220 --> 01:04:47,790
I'd had several bad experiences with
police officers as I was covering the

1133
01:04:47,791 --> 01:04:51,510
protests. And so when I would
see police or their, their guns,

1134
01:04:51,511 --> 01:04:53,940
I'd start to get really anxious.

1135
01:04:54,090 --> 01:04:57,540
And so for me it was just a matter
of processing those memories.

1136
01:04:57,541 --> 01:05:00,390
And that's what the Iowasca
is so beautiful at doing.

1137
01:05:00,391 --> 01:05:05,391
I had stuff come up that I didn't even
remember I remembered and that had been

1138
01:05:05,821 --> 01:05:10,530
trapped in there causing me this
anxiety for the majority of my life.

1139
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:14,340
And um,
and the IOWASCA was,

1140
01:05:14,430 --> 01:05:18,520
was key to helping me access.
That's so fascinating.

1141
01:05:18,910 --> 01:05:23,020
That's very different than
a DMT experience. I really
have to do it because the,

1142
01:05:23,030 --> 01:05:27,230
the DMT experiences,
so it's so overwhelmingly alien that you,

1143
01:05:27,490 --> 01:05:30,510
what what you get out of it is,
it's,

1144
01:05:31,010 --> 01:05:34,930
it's really hard to hold on to anything.
Like you don't see like anxiety,

1145
01:05:34,931 --> 01:05:39,910
you don't see, like, at least for me,
for me, there's, there's nothing written,

1146
01:05:40,270 --> 01:05:45,270
there's everything is
implied and everything is
projected through these things

1147
01:05:45,281 --> 01:05:48,940
to you and everything you see
is impossible to describe.

1148
01:05:48,941 --> 01:05:53,110
There's no words written down. It's
just way too big. It's way too crazy.

1149
01:05:53,320 --> 01:05:57,460
And the DMT Flash,
I supposedly as far more intense,

1150
01:05:57,640 --> 01:06:01,150
but it sounds like the Iowasca
journey is much more introspective.

1151
01:06:01,990 --> 01:06:04,480
I find a very, uh, attractive

1152
01:06:04,730 --> 01:06:09,190
and, and now he, Wasco takes control and
just starts working its magic on you and,

1153
01:06:09,191 --> 01:06:13,340
and really getting in there and, and
healing you whether you like it or not.

1154
01:06:13,490 --> 01:06:15,560
And for some people it's
terrifying because I,

1155
01:06:15,580 --> 01:06:19,880
I've witnessed people screaming and
running out into the lawn and the child's

1156
01:06:19,881 --> 01:06:23,010
pose saying, God, make this
stop or someone make it stop.

1157
01:06:23,690 --> 01:06:26,630
Because for some people really getting
in there and seeing what they're really

1158
01:06:26,631 --> 01:06:30,950
about because they've been living this
personality, this mask their whole lives,

1159
01:06:30,980 --> 01:06:34,430
they've not been their true selves as
a coping mechanism to deal with society

1160
01:06:34,610 --> 01:06:38,930
when they're finally faced with the
mirror held up magnifying your true self

1161
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:43,790
times 40 they can't handle
it. Um, but for me personally,

1162
01:06:43,791 --> 01:06:47,810
I found it to be extremely therapeutic
because I had so much chaos going on in

1163
01:06:47,811 --> 01:06:52,130
my head that I couldn't figure out
what was even at the root of that. And,

1164
01:06:52,140 --> 01:06:54,950
and the IOWASCA allowed me to,

1165
01:06:55,040 --> 01:06:57,340
to really figure out what
was causing my problems.

1166
01:06:57,730 --> 01:06:58,360
Well,

1167
01:06:58,360 --> 01:07:03,360
the idea that a drug experience could
change based on your intent going into it

1168
01:07:03,371 --> 01:07:05,230
seems for a lot of people for postures,

1169
01:07:05,500 --> 01:07:09,730
but when you take into account that
what these drugs are doing, essentially,

1170
01:07:10,060 --> 01:07:15,000
like what, what you're trying to
do when you have an IOC experience,

1171
01:07:15,190 --> 01:07:19,180
it has a big impact on what kind of
experience that you actually have.

1172
01:07:19,330 --> 01:07:21,700
Because if you try to fight it in any way,

1173
01:07:21,730 --> 01:07:25,100
if you try to wrestle with it in any
way, we try to resist. And No, no,

1174
01:07:25,120 --> 01:07:28,000
that's not what I'm like. I'm like
this. If you try to argue with it,

1175
01:07:28,030 --> 01:07:32,050
it will fuck you up.
Sideways Mushrooms. Well,

1176
01:07:32,290 --> 01:07:36,340
DMT will, marijuana will.
If you eat a pot Brownie,

1177
01:07:36,341 --> 01:07:40,900
eat a really strong pot Brownie and
try to try to argue with it. Oh my God,

1178
01:07:41,050 --> 01:07:44,140
you're fucked man. I mean, that's
what a bad trip is really all about.

1179
01:07:44,141 --> 01:07:47,340
It's about your intent going
in, so you got lucky. You,

1180
01:07:47,341 --> 01:07:50,950
you went into it with a perfect
intent mean it knew this crazy bitch.

1181
01:07:50,951 --> 01:07:55,270
Just threw her shit into a bag. Just
jumped. She got a flashlight to read with.

1182
01:07:55,271 --> 01:07:57,130
Like you're the fucking jungle.
You got a little bit,

1183
01:07:57,131 --> 01:07:59,080
you didn't even get an extra
battery stuff. Flashlight. I bet.

1184
01:07:59,370 --> 01:08:02,010
No, I didn't. I had to
borrow all I had to go to,

1185
01:08:02,430 --> 01:08:05,810
you know the guy sleeping next
to me and borrow socks from him.

1186
01:08:06,520 --> 01:08:11,340
So embarrassing some blog
I had. No, it was mosquito
spray. I was just eaten alive.

1187
01:08:11,370 --> 01:08:14,400
I think I brought you a
photo of my spider bite.

1188
01:08:14,401 --> 01:08:16,280
I woke with up a woke up with one day.

1189
01:08:16,670 --> 01:08:20,390
It was the size of a quarter when I
woke up and then it just started growing

1190
01:08:20,391 --> 01:08:23,450
throughout the day or about the site.
There it is. Oh my God, that's terrible.

1191
01:08:23,480 --> 01:08:26,000
And I'm sitting there, I'm
like, wait for two hours.

1192
01:08:26,060 --> 01:08:31,060
I know shit for two hours away from
any state of medicine and I'm just,

1193
01:08:32,161 --> 01:08:35,360
and it's just watching it grow and
grow and grow a not necessarily,

1194
01:08:35,361 --> 01:08:39,530
but it did stop growing. Thank
goodness. Wow. But, um, but yeah,

1195
01:08:40,060 --> 01:08:44,390
there are definitely some amazing insects
there that would scare the fuck out of

1196
01:08:44,391 --> 01:08:47,040
me. I'm terrified of. There
you go Joe. That's uh,

1197
01:08:47,510 --> 01:08:51,380
my roommate Jason shot that photo and
those were just some spiders around around

1198
01:08:51,381 --> 01:08:53,210
the house.
Oh God dammit.

1199
01:08:53,460 --> 01:08:57,420
So I go down there and after you
recommended for me to do, I'll ask,

1200
01:08:57,421 --> 01:09:00,360
I'm sitting at the table in time,
Joe and I'm, people are like, well,

1201
01:09:00,361 --> 01:09:01,560
why are you down here?
You know, I'm like, oh,

1202
01:09:01,561 --> 01:09:05,460
well a good friend of mine
had suggested to go and,

1203
01:09:05,770 --> 01:09:09,230
and I had mentioned your name and they're
like, put Joe just never done. I was,

1204
01:09:11,080 --> 01:09:14,370
and this is before my first drink
and I'm thinking, what the hell?

1205
01:09:16,230 --> 01:09:19,800
I'm all the way in the Amazon.
You should go to Mars.

1206
01:09:21,110 --> 01:09:24,850
Totally go to Mars. How come you
haven't, how come you haven't tried it?

1207
01:09:24,930 --> 01:09:27,090
Because I've never gone down
to the jungle. I've only done,

1208
01:09:27,150 --> 01:09:30,750
I've done DMT seven
times. No, no, that's it.

1209
01:09:31,230 --> 01:09:35,100
As far as the diamond field trip to
me and experience and uh, I just,

1210
01:09:35,101 --> 01:09:38,670
I've never had the time, never had
the time to travel down to the jungle,

1211
01:09:38,850 --> 01:09:39,750
but I'll definitely do it.

1212
01:09:40,800 --> 01:09:44,040
And I think too, it's dependent on if
you really need the healing, you know,

1213
01:09:44,041 --> 01:09:48,720
I mean the Iowasca knows who needs
healing and she does it all use it.

1214
01:09:49,160 --> 01:09:52,500
I do think so. Very much
so. But I do think too,

1215
01:09:52,501 --> 01:09:55,140
if you don't actually go down
there with an intent for healing,

1216
01:09:55,200 --> 01:09:58,380
then it may not work. Which
happened to someone who, uh,

1217
01:09:58,470 --> 01:10:02,450
one of my roommates in the house, he
went down wanting to just see snakes and,

1218
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:06,550
and other things you'd heard about. And
I think the Iowasca knew that. And, uh,

1219
01:10:06,610 --> 01:10:10,080
the entire time he was down there,
he didn't see one vision and I mean,

1220
01:10:10,081 --> 01:10:12,330
he would take his shirt off,
he'd be like, okay, let's go.

1221
01:10:12,331 --> 01:10:16,890
The Shama would bring in his strongest
brew serving three cups and still

1222
01:10:16,891 --> 01:10:18,690
nothing.
Maybe the guy was a robot,

1223
01:10:20,900 --> 01:10:24,720
but I'm so you just never know. You
never know what you're going to get. But,

1224
01:10:24,750 --> 01:10:26,370
but I do believe it
would benefit everybody.

1225
01:10:26,570 --> 01:10:28,190
I'm sorry. They, they say that about DMT.

1226
01:10:28,191 --> 01:10:32,660
That it's like one out of every 20
people experiences nothing. Wow.

1227
01:10:32,720 --> 01:10:36,020
You smoking and everybody else gets blown
through. The center of the Universe is,

1228
01:10:36,021 --> 01:10:40,250
sees complex patterns made out of
love and understanding that, you know,

1229
01:10:40,310 --> 01:10:43,970
see through your soul,
but they don't experience anything.

1230
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:47,360
It was like one out of 20 people,
they either have zero effect.

1231
01:10:47,800 --> 01:10:48,970
Maybe that's what happened to him.

1232
01:10:48,971 --> 01:10:52,990
I felt so bad because they made the trip
down to the jungle and was like a tool

1233
01:10:53,730 --> 01:10:56,840
for the universe. Brought them out.
The university is like, listen,

1234
01:10:57,610 --> 01:10:59,650
we're not going to give you any
reason. Yeah. I don't know the guy.

1235
01:10:59,651 --> 01:11:03,310
Maybe the guy was rude. Cool.
Oh yeah. He's super amazing,
but it just sucked the,

1236
01:11:03,311 --> 01:11:04,600
you know,
he didn't get to see anything.

1237
01:11:04,601 --> 01:11:07,990
But that's kind of the medicine saying
you need, you need to have an intent.

1238
01:11:07,991 --> 01:11:09,640
It's like it goes back to set and setting.

1239
01:11:09,641 --> 01:11:13,410
You need to have that mindset of wanting
healing and wanting to accept the

1240
01:11:13,411 --> 01:11:16,790
medicine. Or like you said,
Joe, things can go ah,

1241
01:11:16,930 --> 01:11:17,680
pretty wrong.

1242
01:11:17,680 --> 01:11:21,940
I wonder if there's like a pharmacological
reason there a biological reason why

1243
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,630
some people don't. Maybe
they'd have a, there's,

1244
01:11:24,790 --> 01:11:28,270
they're missing some sort of expression
of a gene or some point that it doesn't

1245
01:11:28,271 --> 01:11:29,680
allow them to have the experience

1246
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:33,340
or potential and we maybe the
calcification of pineal glands.

1247
01:11:33,530 --> 01:11:34,810
I don't know if that affects it,

1248
01:11:34,811 --> 01:11:36,560
but that just has been something
I've been reading about.

1249
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,330
The water tends to cause
that and other things.

1250
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:42,710
So real though, I mean how much
real work has been done on that.

1251
01:11:42,711 --> 01:11:45,470
The problem is you go to these websites,
then you read, you know, big foot,

1252
01:11:45,471 --> 01:11:48,830
read my mind.
They put,

1253
01:11:48,831 --> 01:11:52,580
read your mind and the calcification,
the pineal gland, for the longest time,

1254
01:11:52,581 --> 01:11:55,660
it was a massive source
of debate. In fact, um,

1255
01:11:55,820 --> 01:12:00,290
the debate about whether or not the
pineal gland actually even had DMT in it.

1256
01:12:00,620 --> 01:12:04,790
And Rick Strassman, who's a friend of
mine and a really, really interesting,

1257
01:12:04,791 --> 01:12:09,470
cool guy who wrote the spirit
molecule Dmt, the spirit molecule. Uh,

1258
01:12:09,500 --> 01:12:12,950
he did all those studies at
University of New Mexico and, uh,

1259
01:12:12,951 --> 01:12:16,280
they had only anecdotal evidence that
it was produced by the pineal gland.

1260
01:12:16,281 --> 01:12:18,770
I knew it was produced by the liver
and the lungs, but the actual,

1261
01:12:19,220 --> 01:12:23,000
the third eye at eastern mysticism,
the pineal gland,

1262
01:12:23,001 --> 01:12:25,980
which in certain reptiles actually
has a retina in a lens in,

1263
01:12:25,981 --> 01:12:28,430
it's actually an eyeball and
certain reptiles, it's spring.

1264
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:32,470
It's really fucking crazy that this gland,
like the third eye,

1265
01:12:32,471 --> 01:12:36,440
it's like there's a reason why it exists
in all these ancient depictions of

1266
01:12:36,441 --> 01:12:40,880
enlightenment. And that is literally worth
DMT is processed. It's where it's made.

1267
01:12:41,180 --> 01:12:44,100
And so recently, just really recently, uh,

1268
01:12:44,120 --> 01:12:46,370
Strassman's cottonwood research center,

1269
01:12:46,700 --> 01:12:51,170
they figured out that they
could observe it in live rats.

1270
01:12:51,860 --> 01:12:56,630
So now they know for a fact that the
pineal gland in live rats produces DMT.

1271
01:12:56,870 --> 01:13:00,830
So it's very, very, very likely that the
same thing is going on with human beings.

1272
01:13:01,410 --> 01:13:04,500
And what, what happened to you
when you smoked DMT? I haven't,

1273
01:13:04,530 --> 01:13:09,180
I've mostly stuck to Iowasca
and mushrooms, so that's
what I've been researching.

1274
01:13:09,390 --> 01:13:11,730
But what happens when you,
when you smoke it?

1275
01:13:12,830 --> 01:13:14,270
Well, um, I've,

1276
01:13:14,271 --> 01:13:19,040
I've smoked a couple of different
types to have smoked five methoxy DMT,

1277
01:13:19,370 --> 01:13:20,900
which is a quite different,

1278
01:13:21,400 --> 01:13:24,650
the experience is much more of a,

1279
01:13:25,070 --> 01:13:30,070
there's like DMT seems to allow you to
keep who you are and DMT allows you to

1280
01:13:32,901 --> 01:13:37,901
examine the culture from some sort of a
new realm that it doesn't take you away

1281
01:13:39,531 --> 01:13:42,740
from the very world that you live in.
It just shows you another one.

1282
01:13:42,770 --> 01:13:46,070
It brings you, it would take
you and put you in this place.

1283
01:13:46,310 --> 01:13:48,830
It doesn't change who you are though,
which is really interesting.

1284
01:13:48,831 --> 01:13:52,160
Like when you're drunk, it changes
who you are, you know, you, you,

1285
01:13:52,161 --> 01:13:56,030
you're more loose and you
know, maybe a little more
rowdy. It say silly, your shit,

1286
01:13:56,031 --> 01:14:00,350
whatever it is that your
particular reaction is. But
your thinking has changed.

1287
01:14:00,351 --> 01:14:03,170
Your, your thinking has changed
when you're on, you know, opiates,

1288
01:14:03,171 --> 01:14:07,000
your thinking has changed when you're
on marijuana, not when you're on DMT.

1289
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:08,450
You're thinking exactly the same,

1290
01:14:08,510 --> 01:14:12,880
but all of a sudden this
door opens in your mind.

1291
01:14:13,720 --> 01:14:18,130
You step like on like on your, on how
you step out onto the elevator. You know,

1292
01:14:18,131 --> 01:14:22,960
you make that, that step over
that gap. You see the floor,

1293
01:14:23,080 --> 01:14:27,820
you see the elevator and the doors open
as the doors of the elevators rising up.

1294
01:14:27,940 --> 01:14:29,080
So,
and you look down,

1295
01:14:29,081 --> 01:14:32,680
you're forced to look down and there's
this little slice of air between that

1296
01:14:32,681 --> 01:14:36,790
elevator in the hotel and then he realized
what the fuck you're really doing.

1297
01:14:36,970 --> 01:14:41,970
You really stepping into this box that's
hovering 70 80 fucking stories over the

1298
01:14:43,421 --> 01:14:48,280
ground held up by steel cables and you're
going to go ride in this box and the

1299
01:14:48,281 --> 01:14:52,570
door shuts. And that's what DMT
feels like. DMT feels like ready?

1300
01:14:52,571 --> 01:14:55,920
Come on in. You too. Don't
you step over this chasms,

1301
01:14:56,190 --> 01:15:01,190
that door shots and then it opens
and then you just fucking go.

1302
01:15:01,360 --> 01:15:04,480
It's like getting shot through
a cannon of geometric patterns.

1303
01:15:04,780 --> 01:15:09,490
And what I remember is the beginning of
it literally being like the beginning of

1304
01:15:09,491 --> 01:15:12,070
a ride.
Like it's slowly exposed itself.

1305
01:15:12,250 --> 01:15:16,600
Initially you have blinders on and it's,
it's colored like a yellow jacket,

1306
01:15:16,601 --> 01:15:20,860
be like yellow and black. That's what
I remember. Like intensely strong,

1307
01:15:21,070 --> 01:15:26,070
a yellow and black that's moving like
sort of spiraling but it's square and

1308
01:15:27,921 --> 01:15:28,271
it's,

1309
01:15:28,271 --> 01:15:31,780
it's very square and it's essentially
like giving you like a little bit of a,

1310
01:15:31,781 --> 01:15:36,030
a slow fucking before it goes
after you. It's like here, come on,

1311
01:15:36,040 --> 01:15:39,910
just going to give you a little kiss and
ma, it's like massaging your shoulders,

1312
01:15:39,911 --> 01:15:41,980
like shooting you down this pipe,

1313
01:15:42,190 --> 01:15:47,190
this crazy squared off pipe and
then boom into the big thing.

1314
01:15:47,980 --> 01:15:51,460
And the beginning of it
was so like Holy Shit.

1315
01:15:51,461 --> 01:15:56,461
Like what am I looking at that you think
their kitten be anything stranger in

1316
01:15:56,471 --> 01:16:01,000
the world until it lets you
out of the bottom until boom.

1317
01:16:01,300 --> 01:16:03,940
And you think that's as crazy as it gets.

1318
01:16:04,150 --> 01:16:06,580
And then as you go deeper in,

1319
01:16:06,581 --> 01:16:09,700
it shows you something crazier and
it shows you that there's no end.

1320
01:16:09,730 --> 01:16:14,730
And it also connects you to
such overwhelming evidence
of things being far more

1321
01:16:17,381 --> 01:16:21,070
fantastic than you could ever be aware.
Just overwhelming evidence.

1322
01:16:21,071 --> 01:16:25,210
Just the fact that you could personally
with your eyes ever experience what

1323
01:16:25,211 --> 01:16:28,810
you're seeing, that it could be
possible. Even if it's a hallucination,

1324
01:16:28,811 --> 01:16:30,940
it is still happening.

1325
01:16:30,941 --> 01:16:35,590
You're still seeing this and this
very experience should be impossible.

1326
01:16:35,591 --> 01:16:36,760
It's too alien.

1327
01:16:36,970 --> 01:16:41,970
It's too beyond the imaginations to
beyond anything I've could have concocted

1328
01:16:42,310 --> 01:16:45,820
based on the context of the life
that I've lived. It's impossible.

1329
01:16:46,360 --> 01:16:47,770
And then they started singing,

1330
01:16:48,040 --> 01:16:52,750
I love you six months and 500,000 times
look at this. And they would say like,

1331
01:16:52,790 --> 01:16:57,010
look at this and show you these fucking
things that were impossibly beautiful.

1332
01:16:57,220 --> 01:17:01,240
Like I remember crying because there
were the things they were showing me were

1333
01:17:01,390 --> 01:17:04,650
so beautiful and they kept saying like a,
like a little child.

1334
01:17:05,110 --> 01:17:09,200
The way a child would tell you they
love you. Like I love you 600 million,

1335
01:17:09,201 --> 01:17:12,650
500,000 times, look at
this. And just, but that,

1336
01:17:12,810 --> 01:17:17,420
that childish love to it,
like was a big theme of it.

1337
01:17:17,630 --> 01:17:21,560
This, this repeating that I love
you 600 million, 500,000 times.

1338
01:17:21,770 --> 01:17:24,710
Like if you tell a kid they love you,
they go, I love you a hundred times.

1339
01:17:24,980 --> 01:17:28,220
And he's like, I love you a million times.
I love you. 6 million, 500,000 times.

1340
01:17:28,221 --> 01:17:31,790
They would say something crazy like that.
And that's what this thing was, was,

1341
01:17:32,150 --> 01:17:35,360
was saying and then just showing. And
I know even you think it was 6 million,

1342
01:17:35,361 --> 01:17:38,180
500,000 times,
that's like my interpretation of it.

1343
01:17:38,181 --> 01:17:41,150
Cause you're not here in real words or
you're just getting like this really

1344
01:17:41,151 --> 01:17:44,120
clear intent that seems
to be talking to you,

1345
01:17:44,300 --> 01:17:46,820
but you don't know how it's
talking to you. You're not,

1346
01:17:47,030 --> 01:17:49,820
it's not like you seen it like on a wall,

1347
01:17:49,910 --> 01:17:53,630
like in you reading it and it's somehow
or another putting those words in your

1348
01:17:53,631 --> 01:17:56,810
head. So I'm saying 6
million, 500,000 times,

1349
01:17:56,811 --> 01:18:00,590
but it was really just that sort of
an interpretation of like a childish,

1350
01:18:00,890 --> 01:18:04,310
you know, pure love. They're not
trying to be your girlfriend,

1351
01:18:04,311 --> 01:18:08,060
they're not trying to, you know, get a
job. They're not trying to, you know,

1352
01:18:08,061 --> 01:18:11,000
get you to give them money.
They're just, this is pure love,

1353
01:18:11,210 --> 01:18:13,070
pure love without any context at all.

1354
01:18:14,330 --> 01:18:18,740
And just a series of beautiful,

1355
01:18:18,741 --> 01:18:23,450
fantastic visions that
you're trying to grab,

1356
01:18:23,540 --> 01:18:25,340
you try to hold onto,
but you can't.

1357
01:18:25,550 --> 01:18:29,750
The way I describe it as like standing
in the middle of a river of fish that are

1358
01:18:29,751 --> 01:18:33,500
going a thousand miles an hour and you
just try to grab them and there's no way,

1359
01:18:33,800 --> 01:18:36,980
there's no way in, but you recognize
what you're seeing when you're seeing it,

1360
01:18:36,981 --> 01:18:39,170
but you can't even hold onto it
because there are new ones common.

1361
01:18:39,410 --> 01:18:42,800
And a new one is so much more crazy than
the one you just saw. And then boom,

1362
01:18:42,801 --> 01:18:45,490
a new ones there and their infinite,
and they never end.

1363
01:18:45,491 --> 01:18:49,340
And they keep going until the drug
wears off. And as the drug wears off,

1364
01:18:49,370 --> 01:18:53,510
there was, you know, like the
love you thing was still going on,

1365
01:18:53,810 --> 01:18:55,700
but there was also like a lot of,
we'll see

1366
01:18:55,700 --> 01:18:56,790
you later.

1367
01:18:57,790 --> 01:18:58,623
There's like a like a

1368
01:18:58,700 --> 01:19:00,530
bye bye bye bye.

1369
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:04,460
Like letting you know they, they
had a good time and then, you know,

1370
01:19:04,490 --> 01:19:07,790
we'll see you some other time when
you're ready. We're here. Wow.

1371
01:19:08,450 --> 01:19:12,710
Wow. How do you go back to reality
after? How do you get a fear factor?

1372
01:19:14,740 --> 01:19:19,000
The first I'm like, what
am I doing here? Holy

1373
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:23,050
Schnitzel. This is a,
it was the first one.

1374
01:19:24,700 --> 01:19:27,700
The first one I did was the
five methoxy one and five.

1375
01:19:27,701 --> 01:19:32,290
Methoxy is much more um,
reality dissolving.

1376
01:19:32,620 --> 01:19:36,520
It's like you don't see anything.
You just, you don't exist anymore.

1377
01:19:37,630 --> 01:19:41,650
You as you, you're not allowed to keep,
you know, you keep it with DMT. You don't,

1378
01:19:41,680 --> 01:19:43,680
you as you,
you don't keep with five meo.

1379
01:19:43,980 --> 01:19:48,100
You as you goes away and you
enter to the center of everything,

1380
01:19:48,520 --> 01:19:51,490
he become a part of the
very fiber of the universe.

1381
01:19:51,491 --> 01:19:54,700
You look at the universe
from a different perspective,

1382
01:19:54,701 --> 01:19:58,960
the perspective that you're at right
now as a multi-celled organism host to

1383
01:19:59,080 --> 01:20:03,640
millions and billions in fact of other
multicell organisms. And you're, you know,

1384
01:20:03,641 --> 01:20:06,550
you're just getting through life,
getting in your car, driving around.

1385
01:20:07,140 --> 01:20:12,140
You look at it through the
energy of the cell itself,

1386
01:20:13,140 --> 01:20:16,230
like you look at it through the,

1387
01:20:16,470 --> 01:20:19,860
the momentum of biological
life and evolution.

1388
01:20:19,870 --> 01:20:24,870
You look at it through a completely
non society based concept,

1389
01:20:25,330 --> 01:20:30,330
through completely contacts rather
through a completely alien context like

1390
01:20:31,291 --> 01:20:34,560
you're seeing the world through,
not through the eyes of a mammal,

1391
01:20:34,710 --> 01:20:37,350
not through the eyes of a fish,
not through the eyes of life,

1392
01:20:37,351 --> 01:20:39,240
not through the eyes of
anything with biology,

1393
01:20:39,480 --> 01:20:42,720
not through the eyes of anything that
has any instincts to stay alive to the

1394
01:20:42,721 --> 01:20:46,890
eyes of something that realizes it's a
part of everything and that there's no

1395
01:20:46,891 --> 01:20:51,450
bottom, there's no up, there's
all and it's all around you
all the time. And I was,

1396
01:20:51,660 --> 01:20:56,630
the first time I really came
to understand the idea of um,

1397
01:20:56,970 --> 01:21:01,470
standing on something as ridiculous,
like the idea that like I'm on the ground,

1398
01:21:01,471 --> 01:21:05,190
like we're standing here in my office.
It's so ridiculous because we're not,

1399
01:21:05,400 --> 01:21:07,650
we're spinning a thousand
miles an hour in a circle.

1400
01:21:07,770 --> 01:21:11,430
That circle is a part of a greater
system called the solar system.

1401
01:21:11,430 --> 01:21:13,650
That system is a part of a
greater system called the galaxy.

1402
01:21:13,800 --> 01:21:15,690
The whole thing is spinning
around a black hole.

1403
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:20,520
Like we're not fee does nothing
flat. It's up, it's down, it's left,

1404
01:21:20,521 --> 01:21:24,390
it's right.
And in having that experience experience,

1405
01:21:24,391 --> 01:21:28,050
I felt like I was somehow
or another just in there,

1406
01:21:28,580 --> 01:21:33,300
a part of the mechanism of the very
universe itself. But it was very not me.

1407
01:21:33,450 --> 01:21:38,430
And then when I had a comeback, I had to
sort of re put together my personality.

1408
01:21:38,670 --> 01:21:42,720
We put together my position in the world
as far as like what my responsibilities

1409
01:21:42,721 --> 01:21:46,380
are, what is expected of me or what I'm
supposed to be doing on Monday morning.

1410
01:21:46,381 --> 01:21:50,400
I had to re put that all together cause
I didn't exist for 15, 20 minutes,

1411
01:21:50,401 --> 01:21:54,420
whatever it was, probably
15. Um, and then, um,

1412
01:21:54,600 --> 01:21:59,550
sort of examine how preposterous I am now.
Examine ego exam.

1413
01:21:59,560 --> 01:22:02,370
I remember him just saying to my friends
after we had just got done doing it.

1414
01:22:02,371 --> 01:22:07,320
Like I can't even even me describing
this to you is bullshit because what I'm

1415
01:22:07,321 --> 01:22:11,070
trying to do is sound clever in
the way I'm choosing my words.

1416
01:22:11,071 --> 01:22:14,100
I'm allowing my ego to paint. Uh, um,

1417
01:22:14,830 --> 01:22:17,220
I want you to be entertained by my words.

1418
01:22:17,221 --> 01:22:22,221
I don't just want these words to come
out absolutely perfectly truthful forum.

1419
01:22:22,620 --> 01:22:26,880
I'm also trying to, I'm trying to
be clever. I like to use words.

1420
01:22:27,030 --> 01:22:29,130
I like to sing a song with words,
you know,

1421
01:22:29,131 --> 01:22:32,580
and I'm realizing that as I'm saying this,
that it's like I'm full of Shit.

1422
01:22:32,790 --> 01:22:37,530
We're all like, yes, there's a benefit to
being full of shit. The benefit is like,

1423
01:22:37,740 --> 01:22:39,990
like, um, it's not even full of shit.

1424
01:22:39,991 --> 01:22:43,440
It's just like my friend Joey
Diaz is my favorite human ever.

1425
01:22:43,470 --> 01:22:45,510
Like the way he talks.
I love being around him.

1426
01:22:45,511 --> 01:22:48,120
He's just so much fun and
it's the way he talks.

1427
01:22:48,121 --> 01:22:50,490
He knows that people
love the way he talks.

1428
01:22:50,700 --> 01:22:55,550
So he's really good at singing a song
with his words, you know, and to,

1429
01:22:55,660 --> 01:22:57,720
to get to get off that,

1430
01:22:57,750 --> 01:23:01,080
to try to look at something
out off that trip.

1431
01:23:01,200 --> 01:23:06,200
The trip of singing a song with your
words is really hard and DMT makes that

1432
01:23:06,551 --> 01:23:11,440
song look stupid as fuck because DMT
lets you know, like, I get it, I get it.

1433
01:23:11,441 --> 01:23:15,520
You think that in the context of
humanity and civilization and your

1434
01:23:15,521 --> 01:23:18,280
interpersonal relationships that you
have with other beings to what you're

1435
01:23:18,281 --> 01:23:22,960
saying is important, but it's not. And
here's, here's evidence that it's not,

1436
01:23:22,961 --> 01:23:27,961
here's evidence that nothing is important
and whatever you do that makes this

1437
01:23:28,091 --> 01:23:30,340
time,
this thing that you think is important,

1438
01:23:30,341 --> 01:23:33,940
whatever you do that makes that
fucked up, stop, stop all that,

1439
01:23:34,120 --> 01:23:37,060
stop all that craziness. Whatever
you're doing, it's causing you anxiety.

1440
01:23:37,210 --> 01:23:42,100
Whatever you're doing that's causing you
too much a objective, thinking too much,

1441
01:23:42,101 --> 01:23:46,720
uh, you know, interact,
interviewing yourself and going
over the thoughts and like,

1442
01:23:46,721 --> 01:23:49,030
why am I doing that? Why am
I still smoking? Why am I,

1443
01:23:49,270 --> 01:23:52,030
why am I still eating shitty food?
Why don't we just stop doing all that?

1444
01:23:52,060 --> 01:23:55,580
Because that's a mess. That's a mess. You
don't need that. It just made you look,

1445
01:23:55,630 --> 01:23:59,630
it made me look so foolish,
but it's very different than nn DMT.

1446
01:24:00,110 --> 01:24:04,210
Just so those are the two experiences
that I had, that I had both of them.

1447
01:24:04,211 --> 01:24:07,420
I only did the five meo three times,

1448
01:24:07,750 --> 01:24:12,750
but the regular DMT was about five or
six more because it was just the regular

1449
01:24:12,941 --> 01:24:16,420
DMT was more, um, more
interesting to me. I figured like,

1450
01:24:16,750 --> 01:24:21,490
I felt like whatever the five meo had
to say, I got it. I got a pretty quick,

1451
01:24:21,760 --> 01:24:26,210
not that I couldn't benefit from a or B,
but didn't, didn't call me back. You know,

1452
01:24:26,260 --> 01:24:29,140
it was like, there it is, bitch,
take a look. You got it. Good.

1453
01:24:29,170 --> 01:24:33,340
Now go about your business.
Whereas DMT was, um,

1454
01:24:34,570 --> 01:24:38,560
every time was a new thing. Every time
I did it, it was a new, it was similar,

1455
01:24:38,860 --> 01:24:41,590
but every time was like, oh, I
think I know what this is about. Oh,

1456
01:24:41,591 --> 01:24:45,460
do you really come through here,
sir? Here we go. You Ready?

1457
01:24:45,680 --> 01:24:46,960
Woo.

1458
01:24:47,210 --> 01:24:49,910
And then some new thing that
you're like, Oh, fucking Christ.

1459
01:24:50,210 --> 01:24:51,910
That's how the IOWASCA is. I, uh,

1460
01:24:52,130 --> 01:24:56,720
one of the healers I work with has been
using it for 18 years and he says still,

1461
01:24:56,930 --> 01:25:00,860
every time he does it, it's different
and it completely opens his mind to,

1462
01:25:01,070 --> 01:25:05,270
he still can't figure it out. And
it's been, it's been 18 years. And uh,

1463
01:25:05,630 --> 01:25:08,390
and I think something else Iowasca is
good for when you look at through a

1464
01:25:08,391 --> 01:25:09,770
therapeutic or medical scope,

1465
01:25:09,771 --> 01:25:12,440
which is kinda similar to what
you had in your DMT experience,

1466
01:25:12,500 --> 01:25:17,500
is that it does take away a lot of the
fear of life and the fear of dying.

1467
01:25:17,750 --> 01:25:21,440
And I think that's something to that
that I had and most people do have a fear

1468
01:25:21,441 --> 01:25:23,790
of death. And, um, one time I, uh,

1469
01:25:24,020 --> 01:25:26,900
had IOWASCA and I hadn't
eaten in five days,

1470
01:25:26,901 --> 01:25:30,380
so I was really ready
to absorb the medicine.

1471
01:25:30,830 --> 01:25:33,740
And right after drinking it, Joe,
I started feeling like I was dying.

1472
01:25:34,310 --> 01:25:35,600
And I started thinking,
oh my gosh,

1473
01:25:35,601 --> 01:25:39,140
has anyone died from Iowasca because
I just in my brain it was telling me,

1474
01:25:39,141 --> 01:25:40,010
you're,
you're dying.

1475
01:25:40,370 --> 01:25:44,720
And I started having trouble breathing
and I was remembering that if I didn't

1476
01:25:44,721 --> 01:25:46,220
remember to breathe,
I couldn't breathe.

1477
01:25:46,580 --> 01:25:49,590
And then it got the
feeling got so intense, um,

1478
01:25:49,640 --> 01:25:53,000
that I remember looking over at my
boyfriend and thinking how sad it was that

1479
01:25:53,001 --> 01:25:57,860
I'd never see him again. At that point,
I started seeing sacred geometry.

1480
01:25:58,490 --> 01:25:59,151
And then I,

1481
01:25:59,151 --> 01:26:03,860
I literally left my body and became this
vibration and I looked back in my body

1482
01:26:03,861 --> 01:26:07,820
thinking it's so sad I couldn't
hold on to that body. You know,

1483
01:26:07,821 --> 01:26:10,880
what's wrong with me that everyone in
this room is able to stay alive and I had

1484
01:26:10,881 --> 01:26:11,714
to die.

1485
01:26:11,850 --> 01:26:14,490
So how many trips have you got
on before this had happened?

1486
01:26:14,600 --> 01:26:17,210
Um, that was my eighth
one. So at this point,

1487
01:26:17,460 --> 01:26:22,310
just fuck the eighth visit or eighth,
eighth time drinking.

1488
01:26:22,311 --> 01:26:26,660
Iowasca so during the first visit,
um, no, this was a separate time.

1489
01:26:26,810 --> 01:26:28,850
So I had a,
I went down to the Amazon,

1490
01:26:28,880 --> 01:26:32,480
then I've traveled the world the past
year researching mushrooms. And then, um,

1491
01:26:32,540 --> 01:26:33,620
when I was in Indonesia,

1492
01:26:33,621 --> 01:26:37,740
I was given the opportunity to be
included in an Iowaska experience.

1493
01:26:37,741 --> 01:26:40,040
This was a couple of months ago
and this is when this happened.

1494
01:26:40,180 --> 01:26:42,130
I wanted to ask you that. The, um,

1495
01:26:42,220 --> 01:26:46,090
I've talked to people that
have done Iowasca with, um,

1496
01:26:46,570 --> 01:26:49,380
things that have come from the
Middle East, different plants,

1497
01:26:49,381 --> 01:26:50,280
and we come from the Middle East.
They,

1498
01:26:50,281 --> 01:26:54,640
they've mixed it and they've seen very
different imagery than the imagery that

1499
01:26:54,641 --> 01:26:59,110
people report saying from the
jungles of Peru and Brazil.

1500
01:26:59,530 --> 01:27:04,530
Apparently what they're Mckenna's idea
was that it might've been someone else's

1501
01:27:05,351 --> 01:27:08,210
idea that he had talked
about in his speech. He, uh,

1502
01:27:08,260 --> 01:27:11,350
believed that when you had
a psychedelic experience,

1503
01:27:11,560 --> 01:27:16,240
you were also participating in all the
various trips that everyone else had

1504
01:27:16,241 --> 01:27:19,930
done. Would that psychedelic like
essentially throughout history.

1505
01:27:20,620 --> 01:27:25,030
And that was one of the reasons why
fairly recent drugs had an empty feeling.

1506
01:27:25,031 --> 01:27:29,320
Like he would talk about ketamine and he
said that ketamine would feel like you

1507
01:27:29,321 --> 01:27:32,770
were in an office building that was new,
but nobody had moved into yet.

1508
01:27:33,280 --> 01:27:35,850
And like there'd be no one there
and it'd be like walking around,

1509
01:27:35,860 --> 01:27:38,170
there's no furniture. Like
this is bizarre. He's like,

1510
01:27:38,171 --> 01:27:42,580
that was the experience that he had had
with ketamine. Whereas with Psilocybin,

1511
01:27:42,730 --> 01:27:46,570
he would have these experiences that
were just intensely rich with all this

1512
01:27:46,571 --> 01:27:48,950
sacred imagery that has been,
you know,

1513
01:27:49,060 --> 01:27:52,640
observed and artwork and at
various cultures like the,

1514
01:27:52,650 --> 01:27:56,020
they have like this interchangeable
imagery that may have like very similar

1515
01:27:56,230 --> 01:27:59,920
psychedelic consumptions. And that,
that's what you're seeing when, you know,

1516
01:27:59,921 --> 01:28:03,070
when you're seeing Jaguars
and black people and snakes,

1517
01:28:03,100 --> 01:28:07,900
when you do the Iowasca and where you
do the Iowasca from the South American

1518
01:28:07,901 --> 01:28:08,440
Iowasca.

1519
01:28:08,440 --> 01:28:13,440
But when you would do the Iowasca that
was made with similar ingredients on the

1520
01:28:13,451 --> 01:28:15,040
other parts of the world,
you have different visions.

1521
01:28:15,160 --> 01:28:17,020
Oh, for sure. And this one,

1522
01:28:17,021 --> 01:28:19,540
I mean the ones I had in the
jungle where like you said,

1523
01:28:19,541 --> 01:28:23,260
more jungle ask and this
one, uh, was brewed, uh,

1524
01:28:23,290 --> 01:28:24,940
in an area of Australia.

1525
01:28:25,480 --> 01:28:29,650
And so for some reason it was just a
completely different experience for me.

1526
01:28:29,651 --> 01:28:30,670
And it could have also been,

1527
01:28:30,671 --> 01:28:33,490
there could've been other variables that
I didn't need as much personal healing.

1528
01:28:33,491 --> 01:28:38,470
Instead, I was led to this knowledge.
Sometimes Iowasca is more of a,

1529
01:28:38,520 --> 01:28:42,460
uh, a ladder to bring you to this higher
intelligence to feed you knowledge.

1530
01:28:42,880 --> 01:28:43,450
And um,

1531
01:28:43,450 --> 01:28:48,400
and so I wasn't having any animalistic
visions or are really sacred geometry.

1532
01:28:48,401 --> 01:28:52,030
I just became, flew out of my
body and became this vibration.

1533
01:28:52,330 --> 01:28:53,920
And it told me clearly,
like you said,

1534
01:28:53,921 --> 01:28:56,680
I don't know if it was a a
voice or writing or what,

1535
01:28:56,681 --> 01:29:01,681
but this huge intense power
told me that that doesn't exist.

1536
01:29:02,310 --> 01:29:05,730
And why do we fear death? Why does
man fear death? It's ridiculous.

1537
01:29:05,760 --> 01:29:10,020
And it's just to cause fear.
And really you are this vibration,

1538
01:29:10,050 --> 01:29:12,480
this soul and amber,

1539
01:29:12,840 --> 01:29:16,470
your body on earth is just your
organic space suit that allows you to,

1540
01:29:16,590 --> 01:29:20,700
to survive on earth, but you really
are, are the sole and no matter what,

1541
01:29:20,850 --> 01:29:25,770
you never really die. And it was
laughing like it how ridiculous that is.

1542
01:29:25,771 --> 01:29:28,140
That man thinks,
peep you actually die.

1543
01:29:28,620 --> 01:29:33,210
And then I was just taken through the
universe and I just was flying down this

1544
01:29:33,211 --> 01:29:36,990
four techs and I saw earth and I saw
all the fighting and wars and all the

1545
01:29:36,991 --> 01:29:40,050
negativity that I'd focused
on for all these years.

1546
01:29:40,440 --> 01:29:44,010
And I saw how petty that
was compared to this huge,

1547
01:29:44,280 --> 01:29:47,850
massive force that was
communicating with me. Um,

1548
01:29:47,851 --> 01:29:51,590
whether it be God or
intelligent beings or,

1549
01:29:51,591 --> 01:29:55,830
or just something made up in my head,
but it was just so intense.

1550
01:29:56,340 --> 01:30:00,030
Um, and I compared that to all
the fighting and the negativity,

1551
01:30:00,720 --> 01:30:05,220
and it just left a permanent footprint
on my brain that I need to, you know,

1552
01:30:05,221 --> 01:30:06,100
whatever.
This force,

1553
01:30:06,101 --> 01:30:10,530
this message is so much more important
than what I've been focusing on, uh,

1554
01:30:10,890 --> 01:30:15,360
on earth, especially in my career. And,
and it started giving me this message of,

1555
01:30:15,410 --> 01:30:17,970
of love and healing and,

1556
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:21,660
and that we really need to get
in and fix the core problem,

1557
01:30:22,110 --> 01:30:27,060
which is a,
this mental disorder facing our species,

1558
01:30:27,310 --> 01:30:30,480
uh, versus just focusing on the
symptoms for me journalistically,

1559
01:30:30,481 --> 01:30:33,340
which was wars and fighting. And then, um,

1560
01:30:33,360 --> 01:30:38,250
after that I was shown how man was created
according to this. Oh, please do tell.

1561
01:30:39,410 --> 01:30:44,000
Um, it just was, I was shown DNA and
I was showing that it was a DNA, um,

1562
01:30:44,070 --> 01:30:47,670
mixing and I had not read any
theories or anything else on this,

1563
01:30:47,910 --> 01:30:52,910
but I was shown DNA taken from other
areas of the universe mixed with DNA on

1564
01:30:53,251 --> 01:30:57,030
earth. And then that's how man
was created as part of, yeah,

1565
01:30:57,031 --> 01:31:01,380
it was pretty intense. Um,
as part of this plan. Um,

1566
01:31:01,770 --> 01:31:05,250
and uh, I don't know.
That's a good question. I,

1567
01:31:05,260 --> 01:31:08,760
I couldn't tell exactly
what this force was, but um,

1568
01:31:09,210 --> 01:31:10,350
but that's what it was showing.

1569
01:31:10,580 --> 01:31:13,700
How many we have this idea like,
oh please,

1570
01:31:13,701 --> 01:31:18,080
you're saying that aliens made people
and came down with different DNA,

1571
01:31:18,081 --> 01:31:22,460
but just life itself on
this planet is so strange.

1572
01:31:22,520 --> 01:31:26,240
It's so bizarre. It's all of it.
All of it. Everything from mines,

1573
01:31:26,241 --> 01:31:28,460
eating gazelles to the whole air.

1574
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:32,960
Everything we do is so strange
and bizarre. Color's changing.

1575
01:31:33,130 --> 01:31:36,200
I animals a Chameleon's change there.

1576
01:31:36,320 --> 01:31:39,620
The color of their skin to try to blend
in like octopus do that and the ocean

1577
01:31:39,621 --> 01:31:42,530
floor,
so much of it is so incredibly strange.

1578
01:31:43,220 --> 01:31:48,220
The idea that we haven't been influenced
at some of this has not been influenced

1579
01:31:48,231 --> 01:31:51,890
by similar strangeness from
somewhere else. It's so silly.

1580
01:31:52,010 --> 01:31:56,210
The idea that pollen and then spores
and the things fly through the air and

1581
01:31:56,211 --> 01:31:59,270
seeds land and that new life
comes out of those seeds.

1582
01:31:59,560 --> 01:32:03,910
The idea that that's on a universal
idea, you know, the idea that, you know,

1583
01:32:03,970 --> 01:32:07,370
asteroids don't carry the building
blocks of, of life. Well they do. They,

1584
01:32:07,371 --> 01:32:10,810
we know they do. So they do.
Isn't that sort of an a spaceship.

1585
01:32:11,080 --> 01:32:12,590
I mean it isn't an asteroid,
a spaceship,

1586
01:32:12,610 --> 01:32:17,610
but spaceship that carry something from
like if some Dna from something came

1587
01:32:17,681 --> 01:32:22,360
here on an asteroid and collided with
something else and then created a person.

1588
01:32:22,361 --> 01:32:24,580
Why is that so weird?
Why is it so weird for us?

1589
01:32:24,730 --> 01:32:27,780
And, and that's what this forest was
showing me. And I'd never really,

1590
01:32:27,840 --> 01:32:30,330
I never thought about this.
I wasn't very religious person.

1591
01:32:30,331 --> 01:32:35,050
I am more now definitely your religious,
no, not religious, but I believe in a,

1592
01:32:35,051 --> 01:32:39,330
in a higher being, right? That
something is, there's more to,

1593
01:32:39,390 --> 01:32:43,740
to our time on earth. And I used to
just think that you die, you die. And,

1594
01:32:43,850 --> 01:32:45,270
and now I'm a,

1595
01:32:45,271 --> 01:32:50,250
it's a recurring theme for me when I do
use psychedelics to remind me that life

1596
01:32:50,251 --> 01:32:53,850
does not end, uh, on
earth. Maybe amber ends,

1597
01:32:54,210 --> 01:32:57,270
but the real being me,
my soul will continue on.

1598
01:32:57,330 --> 01:33:01,570
And then that's just been
a recurring theme even,
especially on the mushrooms. Um,

1599
01:33:01,650 --> 01:33:04,710
they constantly try to tell me that
lesson because I think a lot of my anxiety

1600
01:33:04,950 --> 01:33:06,810
came from a fear of death.

1601
01:33:07,570 --> 01:33:10,810
Well, it's kind of weird because
we, in order to do what we do,

1602
01:33:10,870 --> 01:33:14,200
in order to be a person, in order to
have a job, in order to, you know,

1603
01:33:14,201 --> 01:33:16,930
write your name down when you
signed the Amber Lyon, this is my,

1604
01:33:16,960 --> 01:33:20,770
this is what represents me. You
have to have a pilot. You know,

1605
01:33:20,771 --> 01:33:23,110
it has to be amber in there,
run the show.

1606
01:33:23,470 --> 01:33:27,670
And so because of that amber run,
the show becomes amber.

1607
01:33:28,090 --> 01:33:30,190
But when you have a
psychedelic experience,

1608
01:33:30,191 --> 01:33:33,160
amber run the show really
doesn't get a chance to say shit.

1609
01:33:33,550 --> 01:33:38,110
And then this other thing
gets revealed at the core.

1610
01:33:38,380 --> 01:33:41,980
You know, without a language, it doesn't
have a language. It doesn't have,

1611
01:33:42,040 --> 01:33:46,810
it's not clinging to life experiences.
It's not clean to, um, you know,

1612
01:33:46,840 --> 01:33:50,100
phobias that you've developed
because of negative experiences,

1613
01:33:50,110 --> 01:33:53,920
not cleaning anything. It's just as
pure consciousness. That's very, very,

1614
01:33:53,921 --> 01:33:57,880
very hard to access. That's the real
silence. That's the, the real silence.

1615
01:33:57,881 --> 01:34:00,730
At the end of meditation,
there's the real you,

1616
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:02,590
which you're very rarely even get to see.

1617
01:34:03,140 --> 01:34:07,070
And it's very, very spiritual. Uh, if
you look at the John Hopkins Studies,

1618
01:34:07,071 --> 01:34:11,750
they found that 61% of people who were
given silicide been considered it to be

1619
01:34:11,751 --> 01:34:14,990
the single most spiritual
event of their life. Um,

1620
01:34:14,991 --> 01:34:18,800
also you even look at a Bill Wilson
who founded alcoholics anonymous.

1621
01:34:19,130 --> 01:34:21,680
He believed that a lot of
people don't know this,

1622
01:34:21,681 --> 01:34:24,860
but he used Lsd to cure
chronic depression.

1623
01:34:24,861 --> 01:34:28,840
He believed the LSD could actually,
um,

1624
01:34:28,970 --> 01:34:32,720
should be one of the 12 steps and could
lead people to that spiritual awakening,

1625
01:34:32,721 --> 01:34:37,430
which would then allow them to acknowledge
a greater power and continue in their

1626
01:34:37,431 --> 01:34:42,050
healing. Don't tell that to
doctor drew. And it's so sad show.

1627
01:34:42,051 --> 01:34:43,670
Cause as the more I've
been researching this,

1628
01:34:43,671 --> 01:34:47,480
the more I realize how much
amazing research is out
there showing how effective

1629
01:34:47,481 --> 01:34:50,210
psychedelics are for curing anxiety,
depression and addiction.

1630
01:34:50,211 --> 01:34:52,280
All of these things so many
people are suffering from.

1631
01:34:52,460 --> 01:34:54,440
And we've known since the 1950s,

1632
01:34:54,680 --> 01:34:59,420
the LSD had a 45% rate
it curing alcoholism.

1633
01:34:59,450 --> 01:35:00,980
I mean if you look at Aa,

1634
01:35:01,400 --> 01:35:06,400
there's a study showing there are not
even any studies to show how effective LSD

1635
01:35:06,681 --> 01:35:10,340
is. Some people say it's or
a a is in curing alcoholism.

1636
01:35:10,341 --> 01:35:12,440
Some people say it's maybe 5% effective.

1637
01:35:12,890 --> 01:35:16,140
So you have these substances
out there that are uh,

1638
01:35:16,190 --> 01:35:19,690
we've known for decades now.
We're extremely healing. Yeah.

1639
01:35:19,820 --> 01:35:24,010
It is really effective at
getting people to talk about Aa.

1640
01:35:24,230 --> 01:35:26,900
Exactly. I suppose I thought
you folks were anonymous.

1641
01:35:28,100 --> 01:35:30,620
They bring that shit up constantly.
You don't think God damn,

1642
01:35:30,680 --> 01:35:32,270
I mean I'm sure some people are helped,

1643
01:35:32,330 --> 01:35:37,330
but there are definitely 45% success
rate with LSD is really an astounding

1644
01:35:37,491 --> 01:35:40,340
number when it comes to rehab and,

1645
01:35:40,370 --> 01:35:43,600
and we need to start talking
about psychedelics more.

1646
01:35:43,640 --> 01:35:47,630
We need to make them less taboo so people
start realizing that there is hope out

1647
01:35:47,631 --> 01:35:49,730
there when they've lost all of hope.
Okay.

1648
01:35:49,810 --> 01:35:54,110
Ibogaine is actually even
stronger than that as far as,
uh, the numbers, uh, the, uh,

1649
01:35:54,280 --> 01:35:59,280
the Ibogaine recidivism rate as far as
people going back to whatever they were

1650
01:36:00,091 --> 01:36:03,810
doing, it was fucking them up is
incredibly low, incredibly low.

1651
01:36:04,010 --> 01:36:06,920
And especially with the
Oxi content addiction,

1652
01:36:06,921 --> 01:36:09,260
which is just consuming our nation.

1653
01:36:09,261 --> 01:36:13,400
I think one of my last stories I did
at CNN are on babies now being born

1654
01:36:13,430 --> 01:36:18,110
addicted to Oxycontin and painkillers,
which was really my holy shit.

1655
01:36:18,111 --> 01:36:21,290
What has happened to
us as a society moment?

1656
01:36:21,320 --> 01:36:24,350
And you have sick like
right out of the bat. Yeah.

1657
01:36:24,351 --> 01:36:27,260
They're going through withdrawal once
they're born because the mom can't quit

1658
01:36:27,261 --> 01:36:32,090
using the oxycodone while she's pregnant
because the baby could die in utero

1659
01:36:32,091 --> 01:36:35,810
from withdrawal. So she's got to
continue using it. Then these babies,

1660
01:36:35,811 --> 01:36:40,160
I was standing in a Nicu it east
Tennessee children's hospital in a Nicu.

1661
01:36:40,161 --> 01:36:40,994
They've literally,

1662
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:44,780
half the babies there are being
born addicted to these painkillers.

1663
01:36:44,810 --> 01:36:46,940
This is something our
society is not discussing.

1664
01:36:47,570 --> 01:36:51,570
And I watched as they brought this
baby in and this poor baby was, um,

1665
01:36:51,620 --> 01:36:56,540
it's skin was marbled and it was just
shaking and screaming and crying and

1666
01:36:56,541 --> 01:37:01,040
intense pain just like a grownup would
because this baby was going through,

1667
01:37:01,350 --> 01:37:02,000
uh,

1668
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:06,050
opioid withdrawal and they
had to instantly give the
baby morphine and it takes

1669
01:37:06,051 --> 01:37:09,710
sometimes 30 days for them to
overcome the painful symptoms.

1670
01:37:09,830 --> 01:37:14,280
We had a, a, a doctor and Dr.
Carl Hart yesterday who, uh, is a,

1671
01:37:14,281 --> 01:37:16,380
a drug and addictions expert.

1672
01:37:16,430 --> 01:37:21,170
The guys worked for over
20 years on various,

1673
01:37:21,171 --> 01:37:25,220
uh, tests and various substance
and abuse substances and,

1674
01:37:25,221 --> 01:37:28,310
and analyzing what the root
of all these experiences are.

1675
01:37:28,520 --> 01:37:30,770
And the way he explained
it was really fascinating.

1676
01:37:30,890 --> 01:37:34,730
He was saying that even when you
have a hangover, the hangover is,

1677
01:37:34,731 --> 01:37:37,970
is an alcohol withdrawal. That's what
you're, that you're going through.

1678
01:37:38,210 --> 01:37:41,360
It's not just a dehydration, not
just your body, like being sick.

1679
01:37:41,570 --> 01:37:46,370
It's the compensatory mechanisms that are
present in your mind to counteract the

1680
01:37:46,371 --> 01:37:49,970
alcohol when the alcohol is
gone, it's, or withdrawal.

1681
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,100
Like you go into like
that's what a hangover is.

1682
01:37:52,640 --> 01:37:55,620
And that whenever
someone has an addiction,

1683
01:37:55,621 --> 01:37:58,860
whether it's an addiction to
opiates or with whatever it is,

1684
01:37:59,100 --> 01:38:00,360
that's what they're experiencing.

1685
01:38:00,361 --> 01:38:04,410
It's the compensatory mechanisms fire
up in order to process the opiates.

1686
01:38:04,710 --> 01:38:08,850
And then when they're gone,
then you're sick and you know,

1687
01:38:08,880 --> 01:38:11,220
but the way he was describing
it was really fascinating.

1688
01:38:11,460 --> 01:38:12,720
He was saying that it's really like,

1689
01:38:12,780 --> 01:38:15,000
I'm sure it's way worse for
a fucking baby obviously,

1690
01:38:15,210 --> 01:38:18,090
but for a person it's essentially
like having a bad flu.

1691
01:38:18,510 --> 01:38:21,060
And then if you've gone through
the flu, you've gone through, uh,

1692
01:38:21,420 --> 01:38:24,060
what would it feels like to
have a withdrawal heroin,

1693
01:38:24,240 --> 01:38:27,570
which I thought was really fascinating.
It's like a lot of it is misconceptions,

1694
01:38:27,900 --> 01:38:29,670
misconceptions and um,

1695
01:38:29,820 --> 01:38:33,330
disinformation when it comes to what
withdrawals from drugs and how difficult

1696
01:38:33,331 --> 01:38:37,840
they are to withdraw from. And a lot of
it is psychosomatic. There's a lot of, uh,

1697
01:38:38,190 --> 01:38:38,460
uh,

1698
01:38:38,460 --> 01:38:43,460
psychological issues in involved with
people relapse saying that don't have

1699
01:38:43,471 --> 01:38:46,530
anything to do with chemical.
Pretty interesting stuff.

1700
01:38:46,650 --> 01:38:48,540
And I think that's why
Ibogaine so effective.

1701
01:38:48,570 --> 01:38:53,570
I think some people think it's maybe
around 90% affective success rate because

1702
01:38:53,611 --> 01:38:55,380
they don't experience withdrawal symptoms.

1703
01:38:55,381 --> 01:38:58,620
I think that's why so many people
are scared or addicts I've spoken to,

1704
01:38:58,621 --> 01:39:02,160
especially who are addicted to these
prescription pills as they're so scared to

1705
01:39:02,161 --> 01:39:05,790
go through those withdraw
symptoms. And, um, what,

1706
01:39:05,820 --> 01:39:08,520
even the young man who
discovered Ibogaine,

1707
01:39:08,521 --> 01:39:12,090
he actually went to try it because
he thought he could get stoned.

1708
01:39:12,091 --> 01:39:16,680
So he was just looking for a high and
he was a heroin addict and he tried the

1709
01:39:16,681 --> 01:39:21,120
Ibogaine and then all of a sudden he
realized, oh my gosh, it's been 12 hours.

1710
01:39:21,121 --> 01:39:23,280
I should be having horrific
withdrawal symptoms.

1711
01:39:23,281 --> 01:39:27,390
Why am I not experiencing these symptoms?
And then it was so effective, uh,

1712
01:39:27,391 --> 01:39:31,640
toward the end of the trip, after intense
introspection, I mean, intense. You're,

1713
01:39:31,680 --> 01:39:34,920
you're in that trip for
about 36 hours for some, uh,

1714
01:39:34,980 --> 01:39:37,080
he realized he no longer crave the heroin.

1715
01:39:37,410 --> 01:39:41,310
So then he went and got all of his other
junky friends and started giving them

1716
01:39:41,311 --> 01:39:44,310
Ibogaine,
and then it just spread across the world.

1717
01:39:44,311 --> 01:39:49,200
Now we're seeing centers open up in Mexico
and unfortunately it's still illegal

1718
01:39:49,201 --> 01:39:51,990
in the United States, even though
we have a horrific pill addiction.

1719
01:39:52,260 --> 01:39:56,490
But you can access a Ibogaine
centers in Canada and in Mexico,

1720
01:39:56,491 --> 01:39:57,420
even The Bahamas.

1721
01:39:58,440 --> 01:40:02,370
That's intense. I have a friend who
had an addiction to pills, went down,

1722
01:40:02,371 --> 01:40:06,210
did Obgyn, cured him completely, and
then he opened up a center. Wow. Yeah.

1723
01:40:06,211 --> 01:40:08,520
He's like, this is
incredible. It's unbelievable.

1724
01:40:08,521 --> 01:40:11,070
So now he's got a center
in Mexico and you know,

1725
01:40:11,071 --> 01:40:15,090
he was a guy that was like
a really healthy guy and
then he got injured and then

1726
01:40:15,210 --> 01:40:17,360
the pills just took him over.
He could,

1727
01:40:17,361 --> 01:40:20,340
he just couldn't help it and he had a
really hard time getting rid of him,

1728
01:40:20,790 --> 01:40:25,530
you know, for whatever reason. But
when he went there, boom, it's instant,

1729
01:40:25,860 --> 01:40:30,240
instant, instant cure, instant like
never doing that again. Holy Shit.

1730
01:40:30,510 --> 01:40:35,510
Instant like recognition of the patterns
and then an instant calling to to,

1731
01:40:35,940 --> 01:40:39,900
to be involved in this and to help other
people and to find friends that he knew

1732
01:40:39,901 --> 01:40:43,740
that had similar issues and say, listen,
you got to trust me on this. Come with me.

1733
01:40:44,300 --> 01:40:48,440
Once you've seen the truth
that how powerful psychedelics
are and you're able to

1734
01:40:48,441 --> 01:40:52,610
dispel all the propaganda with this truth
that doesn't have a shelf life that's

1735
01:40:52,611 --> 01:40:55,210
going come out. Just like
you know, now marijuana,

1736
01:40:55,211 --> 01:40:57,940
everyone's finally really
realizing how medicinal it is now.

1737
01:40:57,941 --> 01:41:00,250
It's just starting to happen
again with psychedelics.

1738
01:41:00,580 --> 01:41:02,620
And when you've personally
realize this truth,

1739
01:41:02,980 --> 01:41:07,180
and this is something I'm going through
now and you see so many people around

1740
01:41:07,181 --> 01:41:08,770
the country suffering,

1741
01:41:08,771 --> 01:41:13,771
whether it be from a depression anxiety
or from post traumatic stress disorder,

1742
01:41:13,900 --> 01:41:16,870
22 soldiers a day in the United
States killed themselves from it.

1743
01:41:17,230 --> 01:41:21,790
You just feel a duty like you have
to share this truth with others and,

1744
01:41:21,840 --> 01:41:26,840
and let people know through your
experiences because they are so powerful.

1745
01:41:27,810 --> 01:41:31,790
Yeah, it is unbelievably
powerful and just, it's just,

1746
01:41:31,860 --> 01:41:36,860
it's sort of like one of the things
that we were talking about earlier that

1747
01:41:36,971 --> 01:41:40,480
we're, we are in some sort
of a new era. It's that this,

1748
01:41:40,810 --> 01:41:44,770
the information is being spread
virally on things like this.

1749
01:41:44,771 --> 01:41:49,240
These discussions are happening right
now during lunchtime at schools, during

1750
01:41:50,800 --> 01:41:52,210
coffee breaks,
at work.

1751
01:41:52,360 --> 01:41:56,330
People are talking about these sort of
things that they're realizing and they're

1752
01:41:56,340 --> 01:42:00,070
there talking about things that they
heard talk about things that they've read

1753
01:42:00,071 --> 01:42:01,660
or videos they've
watched or what have you,

1754
01:42:01,900 --> 01:42:06,130
and it's spreading now and it's spreading
in a way that just really never did

1755
01:42:06,131 --> 01:42:06,860
before

1756
01:42:06,860 --> 01:42:09,950
and, and they can't hold it back.
You can't hold back the truth. And,

1757
01:42:09,951 --> 01:42:13,880
and these psychedelics,
they're not, they're not going
to work for everybody. But,

1758
01:42:13,910 --> 01:42:16,460
but if you look at the
anecdotes and the science,

1759
01:42:16,461 --> 01:42:18,800
it's really there and in favor of,

1760
01:42:18,830 --> 01:42:23,810
of using these medicinally and it,
the more research you read,

1761
01:42:23,811 --> 01:42:26,200
the more ridiculous it becomes
that they're scheduled.

1762
01:42:26,210 --> 01:42:31,010
One saying that there's no
med to snow value, that, that
they're highly addictive.

1763
01:42:31,520 --> 01:42:36,320
Mushrooms are proven to be non addictive
and the caffeine in your coffee is more

1764
01:42:36,321 --> 01:42:38,750
toxic for your body.
Then mushrooms,

1765
01:42:38,980 --> 01:42:43,640
the deadliest drug on earth is alcohol
and that's legal. And the more,

1766
01:42:43,641 --> 01:42:47,240
so the more information you have
access to. Um, as for me personally,

1767
01:42:47,241 --> 01:42:51,500
because I'm just waking up to all of
this, um, within the past year or so, uh,

1768
01:42:51,530 --> 01:42:55,280
the more you realize just how ridiculous
the whole system is and it's just not

1769
01:42:55,281 --> 01:42:57,560
in the favor of healing and the people,

1770
01:42:57,840 --> 01:42:57,991
yeah.

1771
01:42:57,991 --> 01:43:01,170
Most people don't realize way more
people die from alcohol then do from even

1772
01:43:01,171 --> 01:43:02,100
prescription drugs.

1773
01:43:02,440 --> 01:43:05,650
Yeah. 80,000 a year. That's
more than car accidents.

1774
01:43:05,820 --> 01:43:10,290
More than a hundred. It's still not as
bad as cigarettes. Yeah. Number one.

1775
01:43:10,291 --> 01:43:12,090
And that one isn't even get your hot,
what guests?

1776
01:43:12,091 --> 01:43:14,210
It does get you high a little bit.
It gives you like a little of a,

1777
01:43:14,211 --> 01:43:18,840
of a psychoactive charge. It gives you a
little, like a little stimulant charge.

1778
01:43:19,140 --> 01:43:21,060
A lot of people like it
for writing apparently.

1779
01:43:21,090 --> 01:43:25,050
Apparently you'd smoked cigarettes and
bright like your synapses fire really.

1780
01:43:25,051 --> 01:43:29,070
Well Stephen King actually said that
when he quit smoking. Effected that.

1781
01:43:29,620 --> 01:43:32,350
Yeah, I used to smoke
occasionally when I'd right.

1782
01:43:32,820 --> 01:43:36,870
Does the IOWASCA era, when he's
blowing the tobacco smoke on you,

1783
01:43:37,170 --> 01:43:40,350
what is the role that
the nicotine and tobacco,

1784
01:43:40,410 --> 01:43:43,920
the tobacco smoke has on the IOWASCA trip?

1785
01:43:44,190 --> 01:43:46,580
Uh,
for me it just in intensifies it.

1786
01:43:46,610 --> 01:43:51,590
Sometimes they blow like a sage smoke
or Palo Santo Wood and that intensifies

1787
01:43:51,591 --> 01:43:54,670
you feeling nauseous
and, and the trip, um,

1788
01:43:54,680 --> 01:43:59,570
others say that they use it to clear out
the bad spirits and blow them away so

1789
01:43:59,571 --> 01:44:01,340
that bad spirits don't come into the room.

1790
01:44:01,460 --> 01:44:06,460
They also use this a wand called Chicago
Chicago and it's like a leaf want to

1791
01:44:07,551 --> 01:44:10,370
blow the spirits out of the room
so that bad spirits don't come in.

1792
01:44:11,530 --> 01:44:15,280
That is one of the really blowing out
bad spirits or they just tricking you,

1793
01:44:15,930 --> 01:44:19,270
you know, like the tricking your mind to
think it's blowing out with bad spirits.

1794
01:44:19,271 --> 01:44:20,980
So it eliminates the fear.

1795
01:44:21,120 --> 01:44:23,190
Yeah. Well it depends on
the showman you're getting.

1796
01:44:23,220 --> 01:44:27,110
It's so vital that you pick
the right Shawmut you've
got to go back to that then.

1797
01:44:27,130 --> 01:44:29,010
Yeah, the showman touched you. Yeah.

1798
01:44:29,011 --> 01:44:34,011
So I went down and
unfortunately now there's a new
organizations are starting to

1799
01:44:34,141 --> 01:44:36,510
really help rate Iowasca centers and give,

1800
01:44:36,511 --> 01:44:39,810
and this is why I'm starting the website
I'm starting as well because there's

1801
01:44:39,811 --> 01:44:44,811
not a lot out there when it comes to
advising you where to go as far as picking

1802
01:44:45,571 --> 01:44:45,871
a center.

1803
01:44:45,871 --> 01:44:49,800
I think now there's a new site called
[inaudible] advisor.org like TripAdvisor.

1804
01:44:50,100 --> 01:44:53,850
So I didn't know. Um, so I went
down to this center and, um,

1805
01:44:53,851 --> 01:44:57,360
I didn't know that the
Shaman who I had gone to, um,

1806
01:44:57,361 --> 01:45:02,280
had other accusations against him.
Um, and so during the ceremony,

1807
01:45:02,281 --> 01:45:06,480
while I was deepen this really spiritual,
amazing trip,

1808
01:45:07,040 --> 01:45:10,300
um, I noticed him coming up to me
and blowing the Agua Florida Ami,

1809
01:45:10,320 --> 01:45:13,920
which is normal. It's the, like the holy
water for the [inaudible]. And he was,

1810
01:45:14,250 --> 01:45:16,080
you know, putting,
putting it on my forehead.

1811
01:45:16,650 --> 01:45:21,300
And then he started putting his hands
down my body and actually went around my

1812
01:45:21,301 --> 01:45:25,260
breasts and went down towards,
um, towards my crotch. Whoa.

1813
01:45:25,490 --> 01:45:30,150
And then kept just rubbing back and
forth and, and I thought that, okay,

1814
01:45:30,151 --> 01:45:33,140
maybe is that part of
healing the bad spirits?

1815
01:45:33,150 --> 01:45:36,870
Rub your actual breasts or round
your breasts? He rubbed like it was,

1816
01:45:36,900 --> 01:45:38,460
he was clearly touching. I mean, he,

1817
01:45:38,520 --> 01:45:40,680
he made it try to seem like he
was going around the outside,

1818
01:45:40,681 --> 01:45:44,420
but he was clearly pushing down on, on
my breast to the point I'm in the middle,

1819
01:45:44,460 --> 01:45:48,060
taking the most intense psychedelic on
north. And I kind of was like, Whoa,

1820
01:45:48,360 --> 01:45:48,961
hold on a minute.

1821
01:45:48,961 --> 01:45:51,900
And then the mother Iowasca I need to
take care of something in this dimension

1822
01:45:51,901 --> 01:45:56,790
because something ain't right.
And um, and he also went to, uh,

1823
01:45:56,850 --> 01:46:01,230
the, the guy who was next to me and
rubbed him in the crotch area as well.

1824
01:46:01,260 --> 01:46:05,230
How dare he, maybe that's a
part of it though. Maybe they
have to rub your deck. I,

1825
01:46:05,240 --> 01:46:08,190
I've talked to every Shawman I've
talked to after that said no.

1826
01:46:08,191 --> 01:46:12,810
And actually when he found out I was a
journalist, he fled, um, the next day he,

1827
01:46:12,850 --> 01:46:17,100
and came up with some outlandish excuse
of why he needed be gone until the exact

1828
01:46:17,101 --> 01:46:19,200
day I left. And, um,

1829
01:46:19,230 --> 01:46:22,560
and I think he thought maybe I was there
to investigate other accusations that

1830
01:46:22,561 --> 01:46:27,300
had been made against him and he left.
And then we had the local Sharman, uh,

1831
01:46:27,301 --> 01:46:29,460
who was native to Peru,
uh,

1832
01:46:29,490 --> 01:46:32,850
give us a ceremonies after that and it
was all beautiful from there and he never

1833
01:46:32,851 --> 01:46:34,570
touched or anything like that.
And,

1834
01:46:34,750 --> 01:46:39,370
and it's not part of the IOWASCA
experience to have your breasts touch or,

1835
01:46:39,420 --> 01:46:41,580
or anything else on your body,
just so people know.

1836
01:46:41,760 --> 01:46:46,230
And that's why it's so vital that you
pick the correct Sharman because they're

1837
01:46:46,231 --> 01:46:51,030
guiding you through this experience.
And that's also why I don't people, um,

1838
01:46:51,060 --> 01:46:52,980
women go down alone at this time

1839
01:46:53,050 --> 01:46:57,790
point. Yeah. Wow. That's in terms, well,
luckily that's all it happened. Nothing

1840
01:46:59,590 --> 01:47:02,350
escalated from there.
But do you know if that car is still

1841
01:47:03,090 --> 01:47:07,230
well? Um, unfortunately he
passed away unfortunately.

1842
01:47:08,130 --> 01:47:10,010
Well, either way, whatever happened.

1843
01:47:10,500 --> 01:47:13,920
It's weird because people tend to say
that the spirits of the jungle kind of

1844
01:47:13,921 --> 01:47:17,670
take care of anything that comes in and
tries to use the medicine the wrong way.

1845
01:47:18,030 --> 01:47:21,180
And oddly enough,
he died around Christmas time.

1846
01:47:21,181 --> 01:47:24,270
He fell off the third floor of,
of his home.

1847
01:47:24,300 --> 01:47:28,530
He'd built in the jungle and hit his head
and passed away. And when I heard that,

1848
01:47:28,531 --> 01:47:32,040
because I had heard other
stories of Charmaine's who've
misused the medicine and

1849
01:47:32,041 --> 01:47:35,820
they've kind of had weird fates
as well. Um, you know, I wasn't,

1850
01:47:35,821 --> 01:47:37,830
I wouldn't be surprised at
the spirits kind of just,

1851
01:47:38,970 --> 01:47:43,200
and some dude who's Dicky grab
threw him off the fucking one.

1852
01:47:43,590 --> 01:47:44,760
Yeah.
You never know.

1853
01:47:44,930 --> 01:47:49,320
But that's the sad thing
with the medicines is there
some of the most profound

1854
01:47:49,321 --> 01:47:50,760
compounds on earth for healing.

1855
01:47:50,761 --> 01:47:53,490
But I think something I've noticed
too in traveling the world, Joe,

1856
01:47:53,491 --> 01:47:58,110
is that some people have taken advantage
of them and claimed to be healers.

1857
01:47:58,440 --> 01:48:01,260
And really in the end of the day,
the only healer,

1858
01:48:01,261 --> 01:48:03,450
the main healer is the actual psychedelic.

1859
01:48:03,810 --> 01:48:07,620
All you need to do is take
that psychedelic go be
with yourself and it and it

1860
01:48:07,621 --> 01:48:10,560
will do the healing.
You don't need a healer per se,

1861
01:48:10,590 --> 01:48:14,010
and you just have to be very cautious
because people coming in with the wrong

1862
01:48:14,011 --> 01:48:18,870
intentions maybe just to make money,
have our opening up centers and

1863
01:48:19,530 --> 01:48:20,160
yeah,

1864
01:48:20,160 --> 01:48:25,110
I've talked to quite a few people that
claim to be a healer and I just think

1865
01:48:25,111 --> 01:48:28,650
that the idea is so
preposterous. A, it's the,

1866
01:48:28,690 --> 01:48:32,490
it's a very preposterous idea that
someone was gifted with these magic powers

1867
01:48:32,850 --> 01:48:37,850
and be thinking that you are is
so fucking delusional that it,

1868
01:48:38,131 --> 01:48:43,131
it is absolutely contrary to the spirit
of psychedelic exploration in the first

1869
01:48:43,231 --> 01:48:46,800
place. Thinking you're the one person
that has this unique gift and you can heal

1870
01:48:46,801 --> 01:48:51,680
people. Get the fuck out of here. Stop.
I knew this dude who was a chiropractor,

1871
01:48:51,690 --> 01:48:54,930
used to crack people's backs and tell
them that your heel and foot fungus,

1872
01:48:55,260 --> 01:49:00,000
he's making you smarter. He's fixing
your zones and like, what are you doing?

1873
01:49:00,030 --> 01:49:03,690
You're healing. And then in a, in
a sort of a discrete conversation,

1874
01:49:03,691 --> 01:49:07,560
he revealed to me that if he
convinces people that they're healing,

1875
01:49:07,740 --> 01:49:12,300
that that does in fact start the
healing. And I'm like, okay, what?

1876
01:49:12,660 --> 01:49:16,590
So you're justifying bullshitting
by saying that the bullshit works.

1877
01:49:16,591 --> 01:49:19,040
If the people believe it, it's
like a placebo effect. Your B,

1878
01:49:19,270 --> 01:49:23,160
you're a human placebo effect. Well it
didn't work with me dude. Okay. At all.

1879
01:49:23,220 --> 01:49:25,680
Like this is a really bad
conversation we're having.

1880
01:49:25,860 --> 01:49:28,790
It sounds like you're a bullshit or
like this is ridiculous. Like this.

1881
01:49:28,800 --> 01:49:32,520
The idea behind it is ridiculous that one
person would have some sort of magical

1882
01:49:32,670 --> 01:49:37,110
power with their hands to heal things
like get the fuck outta here, man. Stop.

1883
01:49:37,550 --> 01:49:41,600
The power is in the psychedelic medicine
and the most amazing healer I met along

1884
01:49:41,601 --> 01:49:44,330
the way was this man in Wahaca Mexico.

1885
01:49:44,331 --> 01:49:48,160
I went there to investigate how the mass
attacks have been using medicinally for

1886
01:49:48,161 --> 01:49:52,180
thousands of years cause it's kind of
contradicts everything we've been told

1887
01:49:52,181 --> 01:49:55,570
about magic mushrooms that they're
actually a medicine there. And um,

1888
01:49:55,780 --> 01:49:59,080
and the healer actually what he would do,
we just bring people in.

1889
01:49:59,081 --> 01:50:03,520
He would make the t give you the mushrooms
and then say, okay, here's my property.

1890
01:50:03,521 --> 01:50:07,210
Go sit wherever you want and be one with
the mushrooms and the mushrooms will do

1891
01:50:07,211 --> 01:50:09,460
the healing. I'm not a
healer, I'm just a provider.

1892
01:50:09,910 --> 01:50:14,890
And to me that was so profound because
we had run into on this journey so many

1893
01:50:15,070 --> 01:50:19,810
phoneys who wanted $400
for a ceremony or you know,

1894
01:50:19,811 --> 01:50:23,500
they, they're hands are the hands of
God with, with these psychedelics.

1895
01:50:23,501 --> 01:50:27,190
And it really is just the medicine. That's
all. That's all you need. You don't,

1896
01:50:27,220 --> 01:50:29,020
you don't need someone else to bring you.

1897
01:50:29,270 --> 01:50:32,450
Well it seems like in [inaudible] and it
become more and more becoming more and

1898
01:50:32,451 --> 01:50:35,630
more popular over the last few years.
The demand for it is so hard.

1899
01:50:35,631 --> 01:50:38,450
There's gotta be a lot of unscrupulous
people that are sort of capitalizing on

1900
01:50:38,451 --> 01:50:42,530
that demand and people who never wore a
Sharman. So just figure out the recipe,

1901
01:50:42,531 --> 01:50:45,430
cook it up, start serving
people and squeeze and tits and

1902
01:50:46,260 --> 01:50:48,150
like this is the best job ever

1903
01:50:50,310 --> 01:50:53,720
touching their dicks. Awesome.
Give me 200 bucks a night,

1904
01:50:53,721 --> 01:50:56,800
which is like a monthly
salary in my country. Yeah,

1905
01:50:58,030 --> 01:51:02,710
sense it seems like they need like an
accreditation thing, like sort of like,

1906
01:51:02,711 --> 01:51:06,610
you know, where'd you get your phd at
Columbia? Oh, that guy's legit. You know,

1907
01:51:06,630 --> 01:51:11,250
where, where did you get your Iowasca
Kero a license to practice what

1908
01:51:12,750 --> 01:51:14,200
it does exist.
But I mean,

1909
01:51:14,610 --> 01:51:19,270
almost more important than being a
phd. I mean, did the ability to, to,

1910
01:51:20,310 --> 01:51:24,500
to accurately describe what happens in
those dimensions to someone who hasn't

1911
01:51:24,501 --> 01:51:26,580
experienced it is impossible.
The,

1912
01:51:26,610 --> 01:51:31,610
the idea behind what you're experiencing
is so fantastic that any words to

1913
01:51:32,611 --> 01:51:36,280
describe it are going to fall
short. So the guy who could
administer that, uh, the,

1914
01:51:36,281 --> 01:51:40,320
the function of that person and your
society and your culture is uniquely

1915
01:51:40,321 --> 01:51:42,420
important and in a really intense way.

1916
01:51:42,450 --> 01:51:44,880
Just as important as
someone who's a doctor.

1917
01:51:45,090 --> 01:51:47,220
Just as important as
someone who's a teacher.

1918
01:51:47,221 --> 01:51:51,930
Just as important as any important aspect
of our community that we consider to

1919
01:51:51,931 --> 01:51:54,570
be a cornerstone, whether it's medical
or legal or any of those things.

1920
01:51:54,840 --> 01:51:58,050
Like having someone who can give
you that experience is a huge,

1921
01:51:58,230 --> 01:52:01,050
that's a huge role.
But you know who's doing it?

1922
01:52:01,100 --> 01:52:03,920
He's a fucking weird guys that are
touching you while you're passed out.

1923
01:52:04,450 --> 01:52:07,680
Not all of them are bad.
There's some really amazing horse.

1924
01:52:07,870 --> 01:52:12,080
I had lost faith almost Joe.
And then I met some incredible,

1925
01:52:12,290 --> 01:52:16,700
a real ios Keros and [inaudible]
scare a woman who, um,

1926
01:52:16,730 --> 01:52:21,730
who's been doing it for years and they
were so profoundly helped me heal and

1927
01:52:21,771 --> 01:52:24,860
understand the medicine that,
that there is a lot of good,

1928
01:52:24,861 --> 01:52:28,280
but it's a yin and Yang. And, and that's
why just warn people because I think,

1929
01:52:28,310 --> 01:52:31,910
oh well this, she went down there
alone and the jungle and it's like, no,

1930
01:52:31,911 --> 01:52:35,720
it wasn't all rainbows and
butterflies. Like I had some, uh,

1931
01:52:35,750 --> 01:52:38,450
some things to have to
overcome there because I,

1932
01:52:38,600 --> 01:52:40,940
I did chose to kind of
go down there so quick.

1933
01:52:41,150 --> 01:52:43,280
Well,
I think it's like everything in life.

1934
01:52:43,400 --> 01:52:47,030
There's going to be good versions of and
bad versions of it and we should seek

1935
01:52:47,031 --> 01:52:51,830
to find the ideal version of it. You
know? And I think also the this, the,

1936
01:52:51,831 --> 01:52:55,040
that Yin and Yang balance of
the universe seems inescapable.

1937
01:52:55,041 --> 01:52:58,940
It seems like it's in everything,
like really terrible relationships.

1938
01:52:58,941 --> 01:53:01,100
They make you appreciate
really good relationships.

1939
01:53:01,400 --> 01:53:05,450
Bad friends make you appreciate, good
friends, bad jobs make you appreciate,

1940
01:53:05,451 --> 01:53:08,570
good jobs. Traffic makes you appreciate
the mountains even more. I mean,

1941
01:53:08,571 --> 01:53:11,890
all those things factor in together.
I don't think there,

1942
01:53:11,900 --> 01:53:14,660
I don't think that you can escape them.
I think you need them all.

1943
01:53:14,661 --> 01:53:15,710
You need the Yin and the Yang.

1944
01:53:15,760 --> 01:53:19,580
You need the Shitty Ios Garrow to make
you really appreciate the beauty of

1945
01:53:19,581 --> 01:53:21,440
someone who's absolutely
pure and their intent.

1946
01:53:21,830 --> 01:53:25,400
I really think that this is the
way the world works. You know?

1947
01:53:25,450 --> 01:53:28,810
I think you tried to get away from that.
You're being silly.

1948
01:53:28,910 --> 01:53:33,170
You're missing the whole point.
The whole point is just seek the light,

1949
01:53:33,440 --> 01:53:37,730
go towards the good.
Just find that he can't fix all the dark.

1950
01:53:37,760 --> 01:53:41,050
It's not fixable like either
the people involved in the dark.

1951
01:53:41,051 --> 01:53:44,240
You have to recognize they're leaning
one way more than they are the other and

1952
01:53:44,241 --> 01:53:45,440
try to correct.

1953
01:53:45,620 --> 01:53:48,410
Hopefully somehow or another they're
going to have an experience that comes,

1954
01:53:48,740 --> 01:53:51,290
that gives them that sort
of understanding. But you're
not going to fix them,

1955
01:53:51,530 --> 01:53:56,510
concentrate on your own shit,
move forward, go, go, go,
go, seek the light, you know,

1956
01:53:56,520 --> 01:54:00,680
go, go the right way. And for some
folks, they just never quite get there.

1957
01:54:00,681 --> 01:54:02,960
And I don't know what their role is,

1958
01:54:02,961 --> 01:54:07,010
but their role may very well be for
someone like you or someone like me to see

1959
01:54:07,011 --> 01:54:08,750
the error of their ways and learn from it.

1960
01:54:08,990 --> 01:54:11,600
And that might be their
place in this giant machine.

1961
01:54:11,840 --> 01:54:16,100
Their place might truly be to enlighten
the others around them as to the wrong

1962
01:54:16,101 --> 01:54:18,230
way.
And maybe when they come back,

1963
01:54:18,260 --> 01:54:22,010
they'll come back with the knowledge of
whatever they fucked up in the past life

1964
01:54:22,011 --> 01:54:23,390
and some sort of inherent form,

1965
01:54:23,570 --> 01:54:28,550
and they'll move incrementally closer
and closer to some form of enlightenment.

1966
01:54:28,610 --> 01:54:30,820
And, and it really helped me
journalistically because I'm,

1967
01:54:30,821 --> 01:54:33,360
I'm not only trying to use
the psychedelics for healing,

1968
01:54:33,361 --> 01:54:37,200
but also to really understand the
history. And, uh, and for some reason,

1969
01:54:37,201 --> 01:54:38,670
after that first experience,

1970
01:54:38,940 --> 01:54:42,870
I just had my bullshit
meter on right times 4,000.

1971
01:54:42,990 --> 01:54:47,010
So right away I could weed through the
bullshit and just get to the healers who

1972
01:54:47,011 --> 01:54:49,440
could teach me the most journalistically,

1973
01:54:49,441 --> 01:54:52,290
especially when I was traveling
through Mexico. Cause that,

1974
01:54:52,560 --> 01:54:56,220
I mean already it's some areas
of there are a little sketchy.

1975
01:54:56,490 --> 01:55:01,490
And so it really helped me to find
the real native Corrine Darras and,

1976
01:55:01,750 --> 01:55:06,280
and have just an amazing, beautiful
experience with these mushrooms that, um,

1977
01:55:06,660 --> 01:55:09,810
I have such a profound love for mushrooms.
Uh,

1978
01:55:09,811 --> 01:55:12,570
now Joe and I understand
why when I was on your show,

1979
01:55:12,571 --> 01:55:15,630
you were saying that if everyone could
do mushrooms that would just transform

1980
01:55:15,631 --> 01:55:16,464
the world.

1981
01:55:16,740 --> 01:55:21,740
And I'm a firm believer psilocybin is
hands down the most incredible chemical

1982
01:55:22,290 --> 01:55:24,840
known to the brain.
And just through my experiences,

1983
01:55:24,910 --> 01:55:27,790
well, it's really close to human
neuro chemistry too. I mean,

1984
01:55:27,791 --> 01:55:31,720
it literally has a n n
dimethyltryptamine in it.

1985
01:55:31,750 --> 01:55:36,580
As far as like what it is before
it is that it's, um, there's, it's,

1986
01:55:36,581 --> 01:55:38,940
it's very closely related.
Um,

1987
01:55:39,250 --> 01:55:43,140
and the most profound ones are closely
related to human, neuro chemistry. I mean,

1988
01:55:43,170 --> 01:55:46,890
the idea that you're going to get this
DMT trip from all these plants that grow

1989
01:55:46,891 --> 01:55:50,310
in the jungle there, these plants are
grown in a jungle, literally contain the,

1990
01:55:50,311 --> 01:55:54,290
the very chemicals that make your
brain work. It's so, so busy.

1991
01:55:54,670 --> 01:55:56,890
They're illegal and they really go,
yeah,

1992
01:55:57,160 --> 01:56:00,230
ignore everything you've been told
about them. It's all, it's all lies.

1993
01:56:00,231 --> 01:56:04,060
When I first had my first mushroom
experience, I really realized, wow,

1994
01:56:04,130 --> 01:56:07,970
how deep the propaganda
went. And, um, and we,

1995
01:56:07,971 --> 01:56:12,590
we've just been fed so many lies about,
about these substances,

1996
01:56:12,760 --> 01:56:15,530
especially silicide, but I feel like, uh,

1997
01:56:15,560 --> 01:56:19,820
the industry has a lot of
fear of psilocybin because
it can't be patented and it

1998
01:56:19,821 --> 01:56:24,260
is so effective. One study at the
University of Southern Florida,

1999
01:56:24,620 --> 01:56:25,910
uh, found out, uh,

2000
01:56:25,911 --> 01:56:29,570
scientists believe after this study
that it may even lead to neurogenesis,

2001
01:56:29,840 --> 01:56:33,530
which is a regrowth of
brain cells. And, um,

2002
01:56:33,620 --> 01:56:35,900
and in that study they gave rats,

2003
01:56:36,080 --> 01:56:39,440
they played this loud noise and then
they'd shock the hell out of these rats.

2004
01:56:39,800 --> 01:56:41,630
And then they gave some
of the routes psilocybin.

2005
01:56:42,230 --> 01:56:45,780
And then later on they played that noise
again and the rats that had psilocybin,

2006
01:56:45,820 --> 01:56:48,920
we're less likely to face
the fear of that sound.

2007
01:56:48,920 --> 01:56:53,540
And they believe that that was because
potentially it had led to the regrowth of

2008
01:56:53,541 --> 01:56:58,541
brain cells and the re reparation of the
serotonergic system that's so intense.

2009
01:56:59,660 --> 01:57:03,170
And this is something that we're saying
is illegal and if it's scheduled one.

2010
01:57:03,171 --> 01:57:07,580
So that means it has no medicinal
benefits. It's uh, addictive,

2011
01:57:07,610 --> 01:57:10,400
but they've proven mushrooms
aren't addictive. And,

2012
01:57:10,460 --> 01:57:14,660
and look at all of these studies
coming out showing that Psilocybin has

2013
01:57:14,661 --> 01:57:19,280
potential to cure anxiety and PTSD.
And so it's really,

2014
01:57:19,670 --> 01:57:24,320
it's just really disturbing.
But I recommend anyone out
there facing, you know,

2015
01:57:24,321 --> 01:57:28,400
who has a type of illness or
PTSD, depression, anxiety,

2016
01:57:28,401 --> 01:57:30,440
and they haven't found
any hope in anything else.

2017
01:57:30,441 --> 01:57:34,290
And if they're feeling hopeless to
just research psilocybin because it,

2018
01:57:34,300 --> 01:57:37,640
it gives me so much hope and I think
it's one of the greatest human rights

2019
01:57:37,641 --> 01:57:39,890
tragedies of our generation,

2020
01:57:39,891 --> 01:57:44,550
that this isn't available to
everyone who needs it. Uh,

2021
01:57:45,240 --> 01:57:46,650
it is very strange,
isn't it?

2022
01:57:46,890 --> 01:57:50,130
It's strange that a person like us
to come along and, and sort of like,

2023
01:57:50,131 --> 01:57:54,540
let people know about this. Like
the, this isn't common knowledge.

2024
01:57:54,541 --> 01:57:56,580
This isn't something that's
being taught in schools.

2025
01:57:56,850 --> 01:57:58,740
This isn't something the
president's talking about.

2026
01:57:59,010 --> 01:58:02,190
Like I have found a way to world
peace and we all need to do mushrooms.

2027
01:58:02,390 --> 01:58:06,630
Yeah. But it's, I mean, could
you imagine how many people,

2028
01:58:06,631 --> 01:58:09,940
and not everybody, this isn't for
everyone. Some people, you know what,

2029
01:58:09,941 --> 01:58:12,870
it potentially have bad trips
if you're not ready for it, but,

2030
01:58:13,050 --> 01:58:16,020
but the healing potential is so
great that it's worth the risk.

2031
01:58:16,710 --> 01:58:21,660
Um, yeah, I agree. I, and I also
think that, um, when you, uh,

2032
01:58:21,740 --> 01:58:26,740
when we go deep into the idea that
silicide and may have been responsible for

2033
01:58:27,901 --> 01:58:32,010
the very evolution of the human mind
itself, uh, it gets really compelling.

2034
01:58:32,220 --> 01:58:34,950
We had Dennis Mckenna on
the podcast and I'm going,

2035
01:58:35,190 --> 01:58:37,860
we're doing some emails back
and forth right now. I'm, uh,

2036
01:58:38,250 --> 01:58:41,980
I'll have him on hopefully
a in April again. But, um,

2037
01:58:42,040 --> 01:58:47,040
he explained in a very scientific manner
the actual correlation between use of

2038
01:58:48,040 --> 01:58:49,960
Psilocybin in the development of language.

2039
01:58:49,961 --> 01:58:52,180
Why there's a connection
and why it makes sense.

2040
01:58:52,540 --> 01:58:57,540
And based on the reaction to silicide and
by the human brain and the connections

2041
01:58:58,091 --> 01:59:01,510
that it makes. And I can't do it
justice to try to repeat what he said,

2042
01:59:01,690 --> 01:59:05,410
but it's incredibly compelling.
And his brother had Terrence.

2043
01:59:05,530 --> 01:59:09,370
Terrence Mckenna had this idea that
was in, in really intoxicating,

2044
01:59:09,580 --> 01:59:11,230
and that was the idea of the stoned ape,

2045
01:59:11,290 --> 01:59:16,290
the stoned ape theory being that when
climate change occurred and the rain

2046
01:59:16,661 --> 01:59:21,340
forest started to see receding into
grasslands, that these undulate cows is,

2047
01:59:21,430 --> 01:59:24,760
these wild cattle would leave
these shifts and these animals,

2048
01:59:24,761 --> 01:59:28,390
these monkeys would come along and
flip the shit's over and find bugs and

2049
01:59:28,510 --> 01:59:29,740
mushrooms that grow on the shifts.

2050
01:59:29,770 --> 01:59:33,610
So they would experiment with these
mushrooms and he had all these direct

2051
01:59:33,611 --> 01:59:38,560
correlations between experimented with
mushrooms and the improvement of various

2052
01:59:38,561 --> 01:59:40,180
acts aspects of life,

2053
01:59:40,330 --> 01:59:44,440
which would make it probable
that these people, these animals,

2054
01:59:44,441 --> 01:59:48,910
these humanlike things experimented
with these mushrooms including eating

2055
01:59:48,911 --> 01:59:53,200
visual, uh, the, uh, eating of
silicide increases low level,

2056
01:59:53,201 --> 01:59:57,580
a low level doses, increases
visual acuity. So it actually
makes you see better.

2057
01:59:57,581 --> 01:59:59,170
It makes edge detection better.

2058
01:59:59,350 --> 02:00:02,140
It would make you more effective hunter
and makes you more sensitive to your

2059
02:00:02,141 --> 02:00:06,040
environment. Uh, it would make you
hornier so he would have more sex. Um,

2060
02:00:06,070 --> 02:00:10,690
and of course then at higher doses
you would get this sort of unifying

2061
02:00:10,691 --> 02:00:12,700
experience that would
bomb the tribe together.

2062
02:00:12,970 --> 02:00:17,380
It would create a tighter group of people,
a tighter group of monkey, like people,

2063
02:00:17,390 --> 02:00:18,340
whatever the fuck they were.

2064
02:00:18,610 --> 02:00:23,610
And he used that as a direct reason
for one of the biggest mysteries in the

2065
02:00:24,521 --> 02:00:25,690
entire fossil record,

2066
02:00:25,900 --> 02:00:29,320
which is the doubling of the human brain
size over a period of 2 million years.

2067
02:00:29,320 --> 02:00:32,200
It's a really fascinating mystery
that no one has ever solved.

2068
02:00:32,380 --> 02:00:34,150
They don't know why.
There's a lot of theories.

2069
02:00:34,151 --> 02:00:37,900
There's a lot of competing theories as
to what caused the human brain size to

2070
02:00:37,901 --> 02:00:42,760
double. But it's an unprecedented event.
And biology, the way Mckenna described it,

2071
02:00:42,761 --> 02:00:45,220
he's like,
if it was like the liver of an otter,

2072
02:00:45,280 --> 02:00:49,930
it would be a spectacular find that our
liver of an odd or doubled over a period

2073
02:00:49,931 --> 02:00:52,570
of 2 million years. I mean, it
would be really perplexing. Like,

2074
02:00:52,571 --> 02:00:57,571
why is this when you have the greatest
transformation of any known biological

2075
02:00:57,611 --> 02:01:02,611
creature over a period of 2 million years
like this and that's the same Oregon

2076
02:01:03,130 --> 02:01:05,830
that created the theory of
evolution in the first place.

2077
02:01:06,310 --> 02:01:07,930
That's when shit gets really weird.

2078
02:01:08,080 --> 02:01:12,550
Like the human mind is the thing that's
figuring this all out and the human mind

2079
02:01:12,551 --> 02:01:15,880
is the thing that's doubling over the
period of this one is one period of time.

2080
02:01:16,030 --> 02:01:17,110
Well,
what else is going on?

2081
02:01:17,290 --> 02:01:22,240
And he pointed to all these factors
that pointed to the experimenting with

2082
02:01:22,260 --> 02:01:26,290
Psilocybin. It's really interesting
stuff. And then with his brother Dennis,

2083
02:01:26,291 --> 02:01:30,550
who's like a hardcore scientist explaining
the actual connections between eating

2084
02:01:30,551 --> 02:01:35,050
psilocybin and the possible creation of
language and of course the exponential

2085
02:01:35,051 --> 02:01:39,040
effect that creating language would have
on these animals and how that would,

2086
02:01:39,050 --> 02:01:41,690
it would,
it would force their mind to expand.

2087
02:01:41,691 --> 02:01:45,010
It would force along with the
psychedelic experiences there,

2088
02:01:45,040 --> 02:01:46,550
their boundaries to shift.

2089
02:01:47,570 --> 02:01:48,920
It's pretty incredible too to,

2090
02:01:48,921 --> 02:01:52,070
if you think on that theory to think
now what are we losing because we don't

2091
02:01:52,071 --> 02:01:56,300
have access as as as
person now we're sick.

2092
02:01:56,301 --> 02:01:59,570
We don't have our medicine. There's
this thing that's created us. Yeah.

2093
02:01:59,670 --> 02:02:02,940
And he also, Mckenna was really
into the eye. Well he's, uh,

2094
02:02:03,240 --> 02:02:06,030
he had a couple of freak ideas to,
one of them was a,

2095
02:02:06,130 --> 02:02:10,260
this longing for this orgiastic
nonmonogamous culture of the past.

2096
02:02:11,360 --> 02:02:11,661
Yeah.

2097
02:02:11,661 --> 02:02:16,661
Dude's always find a way to work that in
even the most spiritual guys find a way

2098
02:02:17,571 --> 02:02:22,390
to work out this nonmonogamous concept,
the mindsets to his girlfriend,

2099
02:02:22,710 --> 02:02:27,170
but his behavior, well in a sense
he's right, you know, as far as

2100
02:02:27,270 --> 02:02:31,140
male programming. But uh, you
know, it's, it's fascinating.

2101
02:02:31,200 --> 02:02:35,670
It's fascinating the concept behind
it that these, at one point in time,

2102
02:02:35,700 --> 02:02:40,700
these cultures supposedly all engaged
in this nonmonogamous saliva and Chris

2103
02:02:40,800 --> 02:02:44,650
Ryan is very interesting thoughts on
that as well. The Guy Rode, um, um, uh,

2104
02:02:44,700 --> 02:02:48,510
sex at dawn, brilliant guy who I
do a podcast with once a month.

2105
02:02:48,511 --> 02:02:53,511
Him and Duncan Trussell and I do a
podcast and these ideas were that at one

2106
02:02:54,391 --> 02:02:59,100
point in time there was no
sense of paternity that no
one knew that amber lines

2107
02:02:59,101 --> 02:03:03,240
baby came from Jamie. You know,
do you guys didn't, you know,

2108
02:03:03,241 --> 02:03:06,210
because everybody was having sex with
everybody and there was no DNA test.

2109
02:03:06,480 --> 02:03:10,560
So if you were having sex with five
different friends at the same time and all

2110
02:03:10,561 --> 02:03:13,140
of a sudden you've got pregnant,
everybody would raise the baby together.

2111
02:03:13,360 --> 02:03:16,170
And that would be the idea is that people
would grow accustomed to that sort of

2112
02:03:16,171 --> 02:03:20,460
a culture and that culture that makes
love together and has sex with more than

2113
02:03:20,461 --> 02:03:22,350
one partner. They, they
like each other more.

2114
02:03:22,590 --> 02:03:27,590
And one of the things that he uses to
sort of highlight that his wife swapping

2115
02:03:27,900 --> 02:03:32,250
amongst fighter pilots apparently
is very high. It's, it's a,

2116
02:03:32,360 --> 02:03:37,020
it's a normal concept.
And the idea being that you know,

2117
02:03:37,021 --> 02:03:40,140
that it's very likely you're going to
die out there and you love your wife and

2118
02:03:40,141 --> 02:03:42,540
you don't want your wife to be
with someone who doesn't love her.

2119
02:03:42,900 --> 02:03:45,720
And so by sharing her
with all your friends,

2120
02:03:45,960 --> 02:03:50,130
you leave behind someone who loves
your wife as equally as you do.

2121
02:03:50,610 --> 02:03:55,500
And then it's that intense of a shift
in the way you view the world, you know?

2122
02:03:55,680 --> 02:03:56,190
Um,

2123
02:03:56,190 --> 02:04:00,840
but I think that we just real stuck on
the idea that the way we live right now,

2124
02:04:00,870 --> 02:04:03,840
this is, this is the pattern that
we're all supposed to follow.

2125
02:04:04,130 --> 02:04:09,130
And this pattern may very
well be a pattern that's
separate from what created it

2126
02:04:09,541 --> 02:04:14,160
in the first place, which might be
psychedelic drugs. It might be the thing,

2127
02:04:14,220 --> 02:04:18,900
I mean even like mainstream Jerusalem
scholars now are saying that they believe

2128
02:04:18,901 --> 02:04:23,901
that Moses finding the 10 commandments
from a burning Bush was most likely at

2129
02:04:24,960 --> 02:04:28,440
some sort of a description
of a psychedelic experience.

2130
02:04:28,770 --> 02:04:32,400
And that the bush that's burning may
very well have been the Acacia Bush,

2131
02:04:32,610 --> 02:04:34,650
which is incredibly rich and DMT.

2132
02:04:34,910 --> 02:04:38,490
So one of the most DMT
rich in the entire region.

2133
02:04:38,940 --> 02:04:41,640
So if that is the burning Bush,
if that's the,

2134
02:04:41,770 --> 02:04:46,290
and the analogy that they're making,
you know, Moses sees the burning Bush,

2135
02:04:46,560 --> 02:04:49,260
is that what they're really saying?
Because we're getting information Hebrew,

2136
02:04:49,470 --> 02:04:53,010
we're getting your from Aramaic
translated to Latin, translated to Greek.

2137
02:04:53,100 --> 02:04:54,870
Is that you?
Sure that's what they're saying.

2138
02:04:55,080 --> 02:04:58,680
Cause what they might be saying as they
smoke some fucking dn and talk to God.

2139
02:04:58,950 --> 02:05:02,190
And God gave him some rules that really
made sense as to how we should live our

2140
02:05:02,191 --> 02:05:02,840
lives.

2141
02:05:02,840 --> 02:05:04,670
And if you look at the
Good Friday experiment,

2142
02:05:04,700 --> 02:05:06,140
I don't know if you're familiar with that,

2143
02:05:06,141 --> 02:05:09,120
that took place in Harvard when
they were studying psilocybin. Uh,

2144
02:05:09,140 --> 02:05:14,140
they gave theology students a high doses
of psilocybin and they all reported

2145
02:05:14,151 --> 02:05:18,830
having similar religious experiences
as to those described in the Bible.

2146
02:05:19,490 --> 02:05:20,323
And so,

2147
02:05:20,750 --> 02:05:24,560
so you kind of have to look back now that
I've been investigating psychedelics a

2148
02:05:24,561 --> 02:05:28,460
lot because I've had my own religious
experience where I've felt like I've been

2149
02:05:28,640 --> 02:05:32,250
given messages from God
or a higher being and,

2150
02:05:32,290 --> 02:05:36,470
and they tend to be similar to those
passed down throughout history. So you,

2151
02:05:36,830 --> 02:05:40,490
you kind of wonder how much did
psychedelics play a role and,

2152
02:05:40,770 --> 02:05:42,410
and our creation of religion.

2153
02:05:42,540 --> 02:05:47,130
Um, next time you come in or if
you can get it, if you can find it,

2154
02:05:47,220 --> 02:05:52,050
you got to pick up John. Marco OLED grows,
uh, the sacred mushroom in the cross.

2155
02:05:52,080 --> 02:05:55,790
Okay. Next time you come in, if you
come in again, remind me and I'll,

2156
02:05:55,791 --> 02:05:57,090
I'll give it to you.
You can borrow it.

2157
02:05:57,390 --> 02:06:00,540
It's hard to get because it's out of print
because the Catholic Church bought up

2158
02:06:00,541 --> 02:06:03,180
the rights for the book and it's
scooped it up and stopped it.

2159
02:06:03,390 --> 02:06:05,760
But there is one that you
still can get this in print.

2160
02:06:06,030 --> 02:06:09,090
It's called the Dead Sea Scrolls in the
Christian myth. Oh, well, you know what?

2161
02:06:09,091 --> 02:06:10,890
Wait a minute.
I should change that.

2162
02:06:11,130 --> 02:06:14,100
Yon Urban started republishing the
sake and mushroom and the cross.

2163
02:06:14,101 --> 02:06:15,630
So you see you can still get it.

2164
02:06:15,660 --> 02:06:18,360
And that's a really awesome
of him that he did that.

2165
02:06:18,370 --> 02:06:20,790
I don't know how he went about
getting the rights to that,

2166
02:06:20,791 --> 02:06:24,600
but it used to be that it was
a very difficult book to get,

2167
02:06:24,930 --> 02:06:27,570
but it's basically by a guy who,

2168
02:06:27,960 --> 02:06:30,780
this guy decipher the Dead
Sea scrolls for 14 years.

2169
02:06:30,780 --> 02:06:35,370
This Guy John Mark or rec allegro and
wrote a book on his interpretations of

2170
02:06:35,400 --> 02:06:39,690
what the language that he had read and
he said that he was the only one that was

2171
02:06:39,691 --> 02:06:41,910
an ordained minister,
but he was also agnostic.

2172
02:06:42,090 --> 02:06:43,950
He was the only one in
the Dead Sea Scrolls.

2173
02:06:43,951 --> 02:06:47,970
That was an agnostic that was in the
committee for deciphering it and his

2174
02:06:48,030 --> 02:06:52,020
interpretation of the Bible after 14
years of studying the Dead Sea scrolls was

2175
02:06:52,021 --> 02:06:54,690
that the entire religion was
a massive misunderstanding.

2176
02:06:55,030 --> 02:07:00,030
It was really originally about was
fertility rituals and the consumption of

2177
02:07:00,241 --> 02:07:02,430
psychedelic mushrooms and that these,

2178
02:07:02,760 --> 02:07:06,120
these allegories and these stories
and all these, these different,

2179
02:07:06,450 --> 02:07:07,740
these different parables,

2180
02:07:07,860 --> 02:07:12,690
they were designed to hide the true
nature of the knowledge that they didn't

2181
02:07:12,691 --> 02:07:16,350
want passed onto the Romans when they were
conquered. They didn't want passed on.

2182
02:07:16,360 --> 02:07:21,150
They wanted to hide it in stories and
that this is what the apple of Adam and

2183
02:07:21,150 --> 02:07:22,800
Eve was about and this was this,

2184
02:07:22,810 --> 02:07:27,630
this rebirth of the understanding of
the universe that would exist if you had

2185
02:07:27,631 --> 02:07:28,950
taken mushrooms,

2186
02:07:28,951 --> 02:07:32,910
you've taken psychedelic mushrooms was
what they were describing and all these

2187
02:07:32,911 --> 02:07:35,410
various stories and all these
different events. They were,

2188
02:07:35,411 --> 02:07:39,940
they were essentially trying to document
the knowledge that they had received

2189
02:07:39,941 --> 02:07:44,941
from having these psychedelic trips
and it's unbelievably intense when you,

2190
02:07:45,481 --> 02:07:49,480
you read that and then put it into
play and then start thinking like, oh,

2191
02:07:49,481 --> 02:07:53,860
wait a minute, I get it. These fucking
ancient people who knew nothing,

2192
02:07:54,130 --> 02:07:59,130
just stumbled upon this shit that made
literally made them who they were created

2193
02:07:59,771 --> 02:08:03,370
them and then all of a sudden
they realized it was going
away and whether it was

2194
02:08:03,371 --> 02:08:05,530
going away because of
additional climate change,

2195
02:08:05,531 --> 02:08:10,531
which they started losing mushrooms and
they started a preserving them in honey

2196
02:08:11,350 --> 02:08:15,490
and preserving them in honey also
started creating fermented honey,

2197
02:08:15,640 --> 02:08:17,710
which became need,
which is alcohol,

2198
02:08:17,711 --> 02:08:22,180
which led to more alcohol based society
and as they move slowly away from

2199
02:08:22,181 --> 02:08:25,000
mushrooms and slowly away
from psychedelic drugs,

2200
02:08:25,150 --> 02:08:30,150
they moved to like almost
an anti psychedelic and
alcohol and that's when Shit

2201
02:08:30,371 --> 02:08:31,440
went haywire.
It,

2202
02:08:31,470 --> 02:08:36,470
this disconnect from psychedelics was
what caused all these cultures to go

2203
02:08:36,581 --> 02:08:39,070
haywire.
It's really fascinating

2204
02:08:39,430 --> 02:08:41,570
and they religions have a,

2205
02:08:41,571 --> 02:08:46,520
a way of prosecuting psychedelic losers
are losers users throughout his charity.

2206
02:08:47,030 --> 02:08:50,620
That is the best like loser, but they
would call it the work of the devil.

2207
02:08:50,621 --> 02:08:53,320
And that's what I ran into
with the Mazza techs too.

2208
02:08:53,321 --> 02:08:58,120
I was working with up in Wahaca is that
they had to, when the Spaniards came,

2209
02:08:58,121 --> 02:09:02,350
they had to flee into the hills to
continue the mushroom tradition. Wow.

2210
02:09:02,440 --> 02:09:05,710
And now you'll actually
see, um, I went to San Jose,

2211
02:09:05,711 --> 02:09:09,190
Delpha Civica one town where the mushrooms
are readily accessible in this other

2212
02:09:09,191 --> 02:09:09,401
town.

2213
02:09:09,401 --> 02:09:13,540
What led de Jimenez and you'll see on
the churches they have Jesus and Mary.

2214
02:09:13,541 --> 02:09:15,100
And then on the other
side they have a mushroom.

2215
02:09:15,310 --> 02:09:19,180
So they actually warship the mushrooms.
They've kind of mixed I guess to survive.

2216
02:09:19,181 --> 02:09:24,050
They mixed Catholicism in with their
worship of these mushrooms. And um, it's,

2217
02:09:24,060 --> 02:09:27,210
it's pretty trippy per se to see
it painted on these churches.

2218
02:09:27,260 --> 02:09:31,190
That's actually a big part
of really ancient religious
artwork, period. You know,

2219
02:09:31,191 --> 02:09:33,410
a lot of, if you look in, look up,

2220
02:09:33,800 --> 02:09:37,130
do some research on the connection
between mushrooms and even the Catholic

2221
02:09:37,131 --> 02:09:37,790
church,

2222
02:09:37,790 --> 02:09:42,290
there's mushroom iconography all over the
place and really ancient descriptions.

2223
02:09:42,291 --> 02:09:47,030
Like one of the earliest depictions of
Adam and Eve on some ancient fresco is

2224
02:09:47,031 --> 02:09:50,690
Adam and eve with a mushroom
tree in between them. Have
you ever seen that image?

2225
02:09:50,750 --> 02:09:55,100
No. See if you can pull that up. Jamie,
Adam and Eve mushroom picture and uh,

2226
02:09:55,130 --> 02:09:59,960
we'll find the, a description
of it. Uh, and eve mushroom.

2227
02:09:59,990 --> 02:10:04,880
Yeah, we just lost track of all this
stuff. It's also one of the reasons. Yeah,

2228
02:10:04,881 --> 02:10:09,710
this is, it's right away. You could
pull up that image. It's pretty intense.

2229
02:10:09,980 --> 02:10:14,270
That's a, that's an image of Adam
and eve. I mean, look at that.

2230
02:10:16,390 --> 02:10:19,210
That's crazy. By the mushroom.
That's fucking crazy.

2231
02:10:19,290 --> 02:10:23,230
And it was really strange for me when I
was in Mexico to see them blessing the

2232
02:10:23,231 --> 02:10:26,800
mushrooms on the altar. A instead
of the communion, holy water,

2233
02:10:26,801 --> 02:10:29,980
they give you mushrooms and that's
your sacrament. That's what you eat.

2234
02:10:30,430 --> 02:10:31,160
There's another one and

2235
02:10:31,160 --> 02:10:34,790
Jamie pull up. There's the other, another
one that's a different image, but a very,

2236
02:10:34,791 --> 02:10:38,540
very similar image. See that one on the
far left, far left. Yeah, right there.

2237
02:10:38,541 --> 02:10:39,374
I click up that one.

2238
02:10:40,750 --> 02:10:41,583
Look at that.

2239
02:10:41,920 --> 02:10:46,700
Isn't that trippy? That's from 1147. Uh,

2240
02:10:46,800 --> 02:10:50,700
they call it CE now. They don't call
it a d anymore for whatever reason,

2241
02:10:50,970 --> 02:10:54,840
but that's from 1147.
So they just knew,

2242
02:10:54,870 --> 02:10:59,870
even back then about psychedelic plants
having some sort of a connection to

2243
02:10:59,941 --> 02:11:04,770
Christianity. And these were, you know,
these were from churches. So it's, um,

2244
02:11:04,830 --> 02:11:07,410
it's really fascinating.
That's just something that went away.

2245
02:11:07,590 --> 02:11:09,660
It was something that was a part,
the doorways,

2246
02:11:09,840 --> 02:11:13,230
the shape of the doorway being very
mushroom. Like in a lot of these,

2247
02:11:13,240 --> 02:11:16,320
they look like a mushroom
cap, you know, that's like,

2248
02:11:16,380 --> 02:11:20,190
there's didn't choose that for,
you know, it wasn't an accident.

2249
02:11:20,910 --> 02:11:25,140
There was a guy jack hair, and before
he, um, he had a stroke and then he went,

2250
02:11:25,220 --> 02:11:26,970
was eventually had a heart
attack and went up dying.

2251
02:11:26,971 --> 02:11:31,920
And he was a very important part of the
hemp movement in letting people know he

2252
02:11:31,921 --> 02:11:35,130
was a Goldwater Republican.
And, uh, he, uh,

2253
02:11:35,190 --> 02:11:38,130
he wrote a book called the
emperor has no clothes about, uh,

2254
02:11:38,131 --> 02:11:42,510
about marijuana and the real root of
the propaganda that allowed marijuana to

2255
02:11:42,511 --> 02:11:46,230
become an illegal drug and his thing, and
he was working on, before he got sick,

2256
02:11:46,310 --> 02:11:51,120
it was all on the connections between
silicide and religious, uh, religious,

2257
02:11:51,121 --> 02:11:54,480
uh, thought religions period,
that creation of religions.

2258
02:11:54,481 --> 02:11:58,020
And he had some really
amazing old paintings.

2259
02:11:58,021 --> 02:12:00,840
I wish I knew where he had
collected these, these images,

2260
02:12:01,260 --> 02:12:05,880
but of people lost in
like a dance of ecstasy.

2261
02:12:05,881 --> 02:12:09,720
Like they were naked and they were
covered by this translucent mushroom.

2262
02:12:10,020 --> 02:12:15,020
And it was a like a reoccurring theme
in like really ancient art work that was

2263
02:12:15,841 --> 02:12:20,841
religious artwork that these people were
engaging in ritualistic behavior with

2264
02:12:21,031 --> 02:12:23,310
psychedelics.
And it was a part of the church,

2265
02:12:23,610 --> 02:12:26,730
whether it was something that was
originally for everybody and then when it

2266
02:12:26,731 --> 02:12:29,220
became more scarce was
just controlled by the,

2267
02:12:29,221 --> 02:12:33,050
the upper crust of the religious
organization or you know, what,

2268
02:12:33,060 --> 02:12:37,440
what happened over how many periods
of hundreds if not thousands of years,

2269
02:12:37,860 --> 02:12:41,160
which is hard for us to
kind of let it sink in.

2270
02:12:41,161 --> 02:12:44,250
How much of a shift to a hundred
years can be, think about it this way,

2271
02:12:44,251 --> 02:12:46,140
200 years ago,
if you wanted a picture of something,

2272
02:12:46,141 --> 02:12:48,720
you had to draw it and if you
want to get around on something,

2273
02:12:48,721 --> 02:12:52,110
you had to ride an animal that's just
200 years ago, you know, 200 years ago,

2274
02:12:52,111 --> 02:12:54,300
slavery was legal and all those things.

2275
02:12:54,450 --> 02:12:58,920
So just wrap your head around that and
then try to move forward to thinking 200

2276
02:12:58,921 --> 02:13:01,020
years before that,
200 years before that.

2277
02:13:01,110 --> 02:13:04,050
And just thinking if at any
point in time during that period,

2278
02:13:04,690 --> 02:13:04,930
okay,

2279
02:13:04,930 --> 02:13:09,610
the pipeline gets cut off to the most
influential connection to spirituality

2280
02:13:09,620 --> 02:13:12,370
known to mankind.
And then people left a boom,

2281
02:13:12,520 --> 02:13:14,500
fend for themselves and figure things out.

2282
02:13:14,501 --> 02:13:17,920
And then the stories are
they'd go from these things,

2283
02:13:17,921 --> 02:13:22,720
which you have this repeatable connection
through ceremony to to the mother

2284
02:13:22,721 --> 02:13:26,710
earth, to the universe, to God
to love. And then no connection.

2285
02:13:27,100 --> 02:13:30,280
The connection is completely seven are
all you have is words describing this

2286
02:13:30,281 --> 02:13:32,730
connection.
Boy would take on a hollow tone.

2287
02:13:32,850 --> 02:13:37,850
And then all of our primate behavior and
instincts and all the shitty aspects of

2288
02:13:38,551 --> 02:13:39,271
human beings,

2289
02:13:39,271 --> 02:13:44,271
control and ego would flourish and rise
to the top and even be fed by alcohol,

2290
02:13:44,460 --> 02:13:48,750
which is the anti psychedelic.
And then culture is left with these,

2291
02:13:48,780 --> 02:13:49,860
these words,

2292
02:13:49,861 --> 02:13:54,090
these hollow words written on animal
skins from back when people were,

2293
02:13:54,270 --> 02:13:56,220
even then when they
wrote these things down,

2294
02:13:56,221 --> 02:14:01,221
probably grasping to the last remaining
fibers of this former existence that

2295
02:14:03,061 --> 02:14:06,150
they had in symbiosis
with the plant knowledge.

2296
02:14:06,590 --> 02:14:08,090
Isn't that the irony?

2297
02:14:08,990 --> 02:14:13,460
Humor in the universe that so many people
spend their entire lives searching for

2298
02:14:13,461 --> 02:14:17,000
this religious experience.
Thousands and thousands of dollars.

2299
02:14:17,450 --> 02:14:20,420
And you can get it for
free growing on cow shit.

2300
02:14:22,370 --> 02:14:26,930
And isn't it funny that when someone
wants to call you on your nonsense,

2301
02:14:26,931 --> 02:14:31,400
they call you on your bullshit? Yeah,
yeah. Oh, that is such bullshit.

2302
02:14:31,700 --> 02:14:35,150
It's like there's nothing that's going
to let you see what's bullshit and not

2303
02:14:35,151 --> 02:14:36,380
bullshit like mushrooms.

2304
02:14:36,530 --> 02:14:37,251
Exactly.

2305
02:14:37,251 --> 02:14:40,490
And I think we've had the push towards
legalization of marijuana and I think the

2306
02:14:40,491 --> 02:14:45,260
next big movement should be to legalize
mushrooms. I mean they grow everywhere.

2307
02:14:45,261 --> 02:14:48,680
They're a natural product there.
They've been proven, as I said before,

2308
02:14:48,681 --> 02:14:50,720
not to be addictive.
They're not neurotoxic.

2309
02:14:50,721 --> 02:14:54,800
Your caffeine in your coffee's more
toxic on your body and your system.

2310
02:14:55,130 --> 02:14:58,730
So why not develop that next push for,

2311
02:14:58,760 --> 02:15:00,290
for mushroom legalization?

2312
02:15:00,770 --> 02:15:04,430
I couldn't agree more and I think what
we need to do is it needs to be done in

2313
02:15:04,431 --> 02:15:07,910
like a, a professional
setting. Like hire people,

2314
02:15:07,911 --> 02:15:12,740
like they have really acclaimed Iowasca
arrows that everybody loves and goes to

2315
02:15:12,741 --> 02:15:16,640
figure out a way to hire someone and
have someone run a mushroom center like

2316
02:15:16,641 --> 02:15:19,520
that.
A person who is an experienced voyager,

2317
02:15:19,521 --> 02:15:23,000
a person who's pure and their
intent and they can help people.

2318
02:15:23,150 --> 02:15:27,020
And what an unbelievably rewarding life
that would be for someone who instead

2319
02:15:27,021 --> 02:15:30,350
would be worrying about their physical
safety in performing these things.

2320
02:15:30,351 --> 02:15:32,150
You'd have to do that
under, under, you know,

2321
02:15:32,151 --> 02:15:35,960
secret conditions to hide from people and
someone have to look out the window to

2322
02:15:35,961 --> 02:15:39,500
make sure the jackbooted thugs don't
kick down the door and stopped them when

2323
02:15:39,501 --> 02:15:41,240
they're in the middle of enlightenment,
you know,

2324
02:15:41,241 --> 02:15:44,480
and arrest them and go throw them in
some rat infested fucking cage somewhere.

2325
02:15:44,750 --> 02:15:46,970
To not have to worry about that.
And to be able to,

2326
02:15:47,240 --> 02:15:49,670
to actually give people
this experience in a, in a,

2327
02:15:49,671 --> 02:15:53,230
in a real pure setting would be pretty
nice. And this is where people go fool.

2328
02:15:53,240 --> 02:15:57,350
Good. So Soutar Rogan is flipping
slogan. Dope talk. I get it.

2329
02:15:57,380 --> 02:15:59,510
I'm tired of me too man.
I'm tired of me too.

2330
02:15:59,840 --> 02:16:03,430
It, it's so profound in what the
mushrooms did for me and what they do.

2331
02:16:03,431 --> 02:16:05,140
I think they're,
they can be so effective,

2332
02:16:05,141 --> 02:16:08,380
especially for women in traditionally
psychedelics have been more of a,

2333
02:16:08,381 --> 02:16:11,410
a male discussion topic. But
I think women, I will admit,

2334
02:16:11,411 --> 02:16:15,730
I think they may even need them more
because we tend to be more self critical

2335
02:16:16,210 --> 02:16:19,960
than men are. And so that's a
prefrontal cortex being overactive.

2336
02:16:19,961 --> 02:16:23,500
And so that leads to depression. And
anxiety and what the silicide and does,

2337
02:16:23,501 --> 02:16:26,890
they've actually done scans of brains
when people are on psilocybin is it

2338
02:16:26,891 --> 02:16:31,510
decreases the blood flow, that area
of your brain. So that for once,

2339
02:16:31,511 --> 02:16:32,800
and this is what happened for me,

2340
02:16:32,801 --> 02:16:36,520
is finally everything just went
silent and it was so profound.

2341
02:16:36,521 --> 02:16:40,870
I just burst into tears and I just could
not stop crying because I hadn't had

2342
02:16:41,110 --> 02:16:44,620
silence for so long. And at that
point, because I had that silence,

2343
02:16:44,621 --> 02:16:49,621
I was able to go back and rewatch my life
like a movie and see all these things

2344
02:16:49,721 --> 02:16:53,200
that had happened over just the span of
two years and then slowly realized, okay,

2345
02:16:53,201 --> 02:16:55,870
that's why I'm was in
the position I was in.

2346
02:16:56,140 --> 02:16:59,950
And I was able to reprocess all of these,
all of these stored memories.

2347
02:17:00,220 --> 02:17:03,490
And if you look at women of,
what is it,

2348
02:17:03,491 --> 02:17:06,550
one fourth of women in their forties
and fifties are on some kind of

2349
02:17:06,551 --> 02:17:09,040
antidepressant.
That's just a bandaid on a bullet wound.

2350
02:17:09,760 --> 02:17:13,790
And I felt like the mushrooms
actually got in to my soul and,

2351
02:17:13,791 --> 02:17:17,530
and cured and helped. Um,
perfect. My limbic system,

2352
02:17:17,950 --> 02:17:20,440
which is what Western
medicine is ignoring.

2353
02:17:21,090 --> 02:17:22,980
That is a really strange number,
isn't it?

2354
02:17:23,010 --> 02:17:27,840
One quarter of people are on
antidepressants over x amount of age.

2355
02:17:28,050 --> 02:17:32,160
I've always wondered why it is women
are uniquely drawn to those things after

2356
02:17:32,161 --> 02:17:36,270
they get to be a certain age. Like what
is it? What is it about antidepressants?

2357
02:17:36,450 --> 02:17:39,860
This is a quick specs maybe.
Is that what it is? Is it a, a,

2358
02:17:39,861 --> 02:17:42,270
a biological issue that comes with their,

2359
02:17:42,300 --> 02:17:47,070
their body's slowing down and they become
less and less happy and uh, you know,

2360
02:17:47,071 --> 02:17:51,870
maybe that could be something that
could be altered by exercise or by,

2361
02:17:51,900 --> 02:17:56,690
you know, like a man can stimulate as
testosterone with squats and, you know,

2362
02:17:56,700 --> 02:18:01,470
there's various, you know,
hormonal ways they could do
that. But the women, do they,

2363
02:18:01,500 --> 02:18:03,760
do they have anything out
there that expands your,

2364
02:18:03,761 --> 02:18:07,530
your natural female sexual hormones?
Does, is there anything that does do that?

2365
02:18:07,800 --> 02:18:12,240
I think there are hormone replacements.
Right? But I don't know of any natural,

2366
02:18:13,050 --> 02:18:15,810
maybe so.
Yeah.

2367
02:18:15,811 --> 02:18:20,430
But I would wonder that at a certain point
if their body just slows down so much

2368
02:18:20,431 --> 02:18:22,600
that they just feel shitty,
you know,

2369
02:18:22,620 --> 02:18:25,170
they're just not producing
hormones correctly anymore.

2370
02:18:25,171 --> 02:18:29,790
And that's what leads them to try to
find happiness in a pill that they need

2371
02:18:29,791 --> 02:18:34,110
something that gives them like a little,
a little serotonin boost, you know?

2372
02:18:34,440 --> 02:18:38,130
And what's so sad is that uh,
a lot of times with these medicines,

2373
02:18:38,131 --> 02:18:38,941
not all of them,

2374
02:18:38,941 --> 02:18:43,080
but it's actually permanently changing
your serotonin levels and depleting them.

2375
02:18:43,081 --> 02:18:45,510
So you are dependent on these medicine.

2376
02:18:45,511 --> 02:18:48,860
Just to get back to where you were
when you started taking it. Saint

2377
02:18:48,870 --> 02:18:51,090
those medicines are really
important for some people though.

2378
02:18:51,120 --> 02:18:54,540
That's where it gets real sketchy
because I don't want to write off

2379
02:18:54,630 --> 02:18:57,360
antidepressants because I know
people that have benefited from them.

2380
02:18:57,840 --> 02:19:01,770
The question is, would they have benefited
equally well from something else?

2381
02:19:01,830 --> 02:19:02,940
Some people may be,

2382
02:19:03,510 --> 02:19:06,690
I know some dudes that have actually
gotten on them and then to help their life

2383
02:19:06,691 --> 02:19:09,250
and then they slowly wean themselves off,
you know?

2384
02:19:09,390 --> 02:19:13,140
And then I know also people that they
benefited from the natural way of doing it

2385
02:19:13,141 --> 02:19:17,460
by taking five HTP and finding that
that gave them an elevated mood.

2386
02:19:18,520 --> 02:19:20,580
And then exercise is a big one.

2387
02:19:20,610 --> 02:19:24,150
They've also done studies that show that
exercise rigorous exercise is equally

2388
02:19:24,151 --> 02:19:28,250
effective for increasing
happiness as aren't some people.

2389
02:19:28,670 --> 02:19:29,930
So it's like how do you know?

2390
02:19:30,110 --> 02:19:32,970
I know personally guys have
benefited from antidepressant,

2391
02:19:32,971 --> 02:19:36,650
so you can't say this guy shouldn't take
it because I don't know what's going on

2392
02:19:36,651 --> 02:19:39,050
in his head. You know, and
I'm not understand the,

2393
02:19:39,350 --> 02:19:43,430
the actual science behind it all.
I can parrot it,

2394
02:19:43,700 --> 02:19:47,000
but I don't really understand what the
fuck is going on like comprehensively.

2395
02:19:47,270 --> 02:19:50,480
And I think that you would have to
really study it for a long time to really

2396
02:19:50,481 --> 02:19:54,500
understand it comprehensively, but I think
there should be more than one option.

2397
02:19:54,560 --> 02:19:55,393
That's my point.

2398
02:19:55,400 --> 02:19:59,000
My point is it's real problematic when
you got something like partnership for a

2399
02:19:59,001 --> 02:20:03,350
drug free America and they get money
for pharmaceutical companies to go after

2400
02:20:03,410 --> 02:20:07,760
other drugs. I mean, it's one of the
most hilarious aspects of our culture,

2401
02:20:08,060 --> 02:20:13,060
but the fact is that alcohol companies
paid for ads against marijuana and that

2402
02:20:14,701 --> 02:20:18,320
that's a fact. That's what a partnership
for a drug free America entails.

2403
02:20:18,530 --> 02:20:22,640
Prescription drug companies, alcohol
companies, all paid part of that.

2404
02:20:22,790 --> 02:20:26,060
It's just ridiculous.
So it should be,

2405
02:20:26,061 --> 02:20:27,950
there should be a bunch of
different options available.

2406
02:20:28,610 --> 02:20:29,030
Exactly.

2407
02:20:29,030 --> 02:20:33,380
That's why I'm trying to talk about my
story with psychedelic use and how much

2408
02:20:33,381 --> 02:20:36,950
it helped me just so people know when
the other options haven't worked. Um,

2409
02:20:36,980 --> 02:20:38,450
like you said, Joe, I'm not discounting.

2410
02:20:38,451 --> 02:20:41,090
I'm sure a lot of people have
been helped from pharmaceuticals,

2411
02:20:41,600 --> 02:20:45,740
but I think some people have tried
them and because it is the only option,

2412
02:20:46,010 --> 02:20:49,640
they feel like, oh my
gosh, it's, this is it.

2413
02:20:49,641 --> 02:20:53,690
And that's why so many of these soldiers
who have post traumatic stress disorder

2414
02:20:53,900 --> 02:20:55,430
end up taking their own lives.

2415
02:20:55,431 --> 02:20:58,490
And I interviewed one soldier
who was at that point,

2416
02:20:58,491 --> 02:21:02,360
he had been on antidepressants and
nothing was working. He was having,

2417
02:21:02,630 --> 02:21:06,260
he had a panic attack that sent him to
the emergency room and almost killed him

2418
02:21:06,830 --> 02:21:09,560
because his heart rate was so quick.
And um,

2419
02:21:09,740 --> 02:21:14,740
and luckily he heard about Mtma and
psilocybin and went to a concert and got

2420
02:21:15,171 --> 02:21:19,880
some wow. And that was, uh, had profound
effects. He wasn't able to be in crowds.

2421
02:21:19,881 --> 02:21:23,180
And then within weeks he was
able to go back out into society.

2422
02:21:23,480 --> 02:21:26,480
And now he actually takes
the mushrooms and travels,

2423
02:21:26,510 --> 02:21:30,350
he's like an underground railroad of
psychedelics between soldiers and he

2424
02:21:30,351 --> 02:21:32,840
travels around the country,
uh,

2425
02:21:33,050 --> 02:21:37,070
a dosing his buddies so that they
can kind of get out of this Rut.

2426
02:21:37,100 --> 02:21:39,680
Those that haven't been helped
by anti depressants. Wow.

2427
02:21:40,450 --> 02:21:44,660
And the Mtma his shows you, I know you
talk with Rick Doblin allotted just so,

2428
02:21:44,661 --> 02:21:49,040
such profound promise that in one
study they had people who had treatment

2429
02:21:49,041 --> 02:21:51,710
resistant PTSD.
So nothing was working.

2430
02:21:52,100 --> 02:21:56,750
And 83% of the people in this study
who were given Mtma combined with

2431
02:21:56,751 --> 02:22:00,890
psychotherapy, uh, no longer
had the symptoms of post
traumatic stress disorder,

2432
02:22:01,070 --> 02:22:05,150
whereas 25% of people who just were
given psychotherapy were healed. So,

2433
02:22:05,151 --> 02:22:08,090
I mean that's a pretty
profound numbers there and

2434
02:22:08,430 --> 02:22:11,700
numbers. Could you imagine if that
number was any other sort of medication?

2435
02:22:12,030 --> 02:22:15,000
Exactly. Every doctor be prescribing
it to you, they'd be a no brainer.

2436
02:22:15,001 --> 02:22:17,460
You'd go to the doctor and they would
immediately prescribed it to you.

2437
02:22:17,730 --> 02:22:21,580
We have 22 soldiers a day killing
themselves needlessly, Joe. And that,

2438
02:22:21,610 --> 02:22:24,180
that weighs on my shoulders
now. Cause I, I did,

2439
02:22:24,220 --> 02:22:27,900
I was never officially with posttraumatic
stress disorder. But I do know,

2440
02:22:27,901 --> 02:22:29,820
especially after talking
with a lot of these soldiers,

2441
02:22:29,821 --> 02:22:34,680
I was having symptoms of it and
knowing how profoundly effective the

2442
02:22:34,681 --> 02:22:37,340
psychedelics were on helping me and,

2443
02:22:37,420 --> 02:22:41,550
and curing my anxiety and letting me
process those traumatic memories. Um,

2444
02:22:41,551 --> 02:22:44,580
it's so sad to know that there's so
many people out there that haven't been

2445
02:22:44,581 --> 02:22:48,300
connected with this medicine
yet or are being misled.

2446
02:22:48,630 --> 02:22:52,530
And in the United States government knows
that Mtma they've been told many times

2447
02:22:52,531 --> 02:22:54,870
they'd been shown the
results of this study. Uh,

2448
02:22:54,871 --> 02:22:59,700
the Pentagon knows that it's effective.
Why? Why hasn't it been legalized?

2449
02:23:00,270 --> 02:23:03,120
Well, because someone can profit
from it not being legalized.

2450
02:23:03,121 --> 02:23:06,300
It's the only reason. And it's too
easy to grow. That's the problem.

2451
02:23:06,540 --> 02:23:08,910
These drugs that are really,
really beneficial,

2452
02:23:09,210 --> 02:23:12,840
boy does nature make them
readily available because
nature wants us to take them.

2453
02:23:12,880 --> 02:23:15,510
[inaudible] need to knows we're insane.
You could drive if,

2454
02:23:15,511 --> 02:23:18,090
especially if you live in a nice place
like Seattle where it rains a lot.

2455
02:23:18,120 --> 02:23:21,690
You could drive down the street,
throw pot seeds out the window,

2456
02:23:21,780 --> 02:23:25,980
just throw him as you drive and then
come back a couple months later and poppy

2457
02:23:25,981 --> 02:23:29,280
growing everywhere, it would be
unavoidable. It's that easy. You know?

2458
02:23:29,310 --> 02:23:33,240
It's like we were all right,
dude. Hey, you need fertilizer,
do you? Nope. Nope, nope,

2459
02:23:33,270 --> 02:23:36,390
nope. Don't need anything. Don't worry
about me. I'll just go right here.

2460
02:23:36,840 --> 02:23:40,480
The best things in life are free. It's,
it's for sure, and I'm a firm believer

2461
02:23:40,600 --> 02:23:43,960
or that nature has created.
Uh, I used to be a skeptic,

2462
02:23:43,961 --> 02:23:47,950
but now I am a believer that nature has
created something to heal all of our

2463
02:23:47,951 --> 02:23:50,760
ailments. And we just need to
be connected with that. And,

2464
02:23:50,761 --> 02:23:55,000
and we need to realize that sometimes
it's the more natural route that's more

2465
02:23:55,001 --> 02:23:57,150
effective versus going
the pharmaceutical route.

2466
02:23:57,670 --> 02:24:02,110
And oftentimes the pharmaceutical route
is sort of based on something that came

2467
02:24:02,111 --> 02:24:04,660
from the natural route in the
first place. I mean the, the, the,

2468
02:24:04,661 --> 02:24:08,260
the lessons learned from using natural
materials sometimes. I mean, one of the,

2469
02:24:08,261 --> 02:24:11,110
one of the things, one thing that
they want to do so much in the jungle,

2470
02:24:11,230 --> 02:24:14,680
they want to extract pharmaceutical
drugs out of these jungle plants.

2471
02:24:14,700 --> 02:24:19,090
And that's a big reason why there's so
much exploration in the jungle besides

2472
02:24:19,390 --> 02:24:21,260
using all the wood,
you know,

2473
02:24:21,280 --> 02:24:24,880
that they're clear cutting
giant chunks of that forest.

2474
02:24:25,060 --> 02:24:28,360
One of the things that the medical
community is really concerned about when

2475
02:24:28,361 --> 02:24:30,550
they're doing that is that
when they're clear cutting,

2476
02:24:30,760 --> 02:24:34,480
I mean they're destroying ecosystems
and when they're destroying ecosystems,

2477
02:24:34,750 --> 02:24:39,750
we know there are hundreds of thousands
of different types of plants down there

2478
02:24:40,240 --> 02:24:44,260
and we have no idea if the cure to cancer
is not locked up at some weird fucking

2479
02:24:44,261 --> 02:24:48,460
bury that no one has ever discovered.
We just don't know. And it might be,

2480
02:24:48,700 --> 02:24:53,170
it really might be. They found his fucking
spider, the Brazilian wandering spider,

2481
02:24:53,920 --> 02:24:56,470
and they're trying to use it
for a better viagara cause this,

2482
02:24:56,471 --> 02:24:58,930
the spider is the most poisonous spider.

2483
02:24:58,931 --> 02:25:00,820
The Vera found kills
you and when kills you.

2484
02:25:00,821 --> 02:25:04,840
One of the ways that kills you is with
an erection that is unbelievably painful.

2485
02:25:04,930 --> 02:25:08,950
Literally breaks the skin on your penis.
So even if you get through it,

2486
02:25:08,951 --> 02:25:13,120
which many people don't fights
you and then you get this
erection, you get it, it,

2487
02:25:13,150 --> 02:25:18,150
it affects somehow or another the
nitric oxide production of your body and

2488
02:25:18,581 --> 02:25:19,180
you're in,

2489
02:25:19,180 --> 02:25:24,010
it injects you with something that does
something to the whole mechanism and

2490
02:25:24,130 --> 02:25:29,130
your whole body becomes unbelievably
painful and rigid and you get an erection.

2491
02:25:29,260 --> 02:25:32,380
And the erection is like,
have you ever thrown a hot dog on a grill?

2492
02:25:32,410 --> 02:25:35,920
And he's it plumps and then it pops.
Yeah, that's you. That's your penis.

2493
02:25:36,610 --> 02:25:41,290
It plumps and it's apparently it breaks
it if you live, even if you live,

2494
02:25:41,440 --> 02:25:44,440
your sexuality is ruined.
You're never having your Dick is broken.

2495
02:25:44,470 --> 02:25:46,750
It doesn't work anymore.
I get red lines,

2496
02:25:46,751 --> 02:25:49,150
that thing until piston start
farming out of the sides of it.

2497
02:25:49,450 --> 02:25:52,900
So even if you do survive,
you're broken. And they,

2498
02:25:52,901 --> 02:25:56,200
so they found this fucking creepy spider
and they're trying to figure out how to

2499
02:25:56,201 --> 02:25:59,080
make like the best hard
on pill ever with this.

2500
02:25:59,320 --> 02:26:03,280
Like forget about Viagara like we're
talking, you just need like a molecule,

2501
02:26:03,281 --> 02:26:07,300
this shit thrown in your system
and you have erections on demand.

2502
02:26:08,050 --> 02:26:11,850
It's like I was thinking of nature
has a, a cure for everything. Even uh,

2503
02:26:11,940 --> 02:26:16,920
there's this one shaman in the Amazon
in his entire village was sick and he

2504
02:26:16,930 --> 02:26:20,800
couldn't cure them. And so he thought his
entire tribe was going to be wiped out.

2505
02:26:20,801 --> 02:26:21,700
So legend has it.

2506
02:26:21,701 --> 02:26:25,720
He drank IOWASCA and walked into the
jungle and these hands came out and showed

2507
02:26:25,721 --> 02:26:27,640
him this frog,
which is the Kambo frog.

2508
02:26:27,641 --> 02:26:31,660
It's the most poisonous frog in the
jungle and showed him how to kind of milk

2509
02:26:31,661 --> 02:26:33,400
the frog and then put it,

2510
02:26:33,490 --> 02:26:37,120
apply the poison to the
people in the village to,

2511
02:26:37,180 --> 02:26:39,520
to cure what was ailing them.
And he was able to,

2512
02:26:39,521 --> 02:26:42,070
as legend has it curious
how his whole village,

2513
02:26:42,340 --> 02:26:46,450
well now this Kambo frog venom
is used as a vaccination.

2514
02:26:46,451 --> 02:26:51,100
So instead of the traditional vaccinations
we give here in the u s they use this

2515
02:26:51,101 --> 02:26:55,690
frog venom to vaccinate the children and
also to make the men stronger as they

2516
02:26:55,691 --> 02:26:56,524
hunt.

2517
02:26:56,530 --> 02:26:59,920
And I actually got it at w and what they
do is they just kind of cauterize your

2518
02:26:59,921 --> 02:27:04,630
arm and put a little on you and right
away you feel like you're being poisoned.

2519
02:27:04,900 --> 02:27:09,610
So your whole body reacts to produce
all of these antibodies and an emergency

2520
02:27:09,611 --> 02:27:10,900
effort to try to save your life.

2521
02:27:10,901 --> 02:27:13,960
And you just feel the blood pounding
through your head and it's almost,

2522
02:27:13,961 --> 02:27:15,820
it's so intense.
It's like going,

2523
02:27:15,821 --> 02:27:18,200
you feel like it will shoot
through your fingertips and Oh,

2524
02:27:18,400 --> 02:27:20,740
and like all these frogs are
running through you and your,

2525
02:27:20,741 --> 02:27:23,950
your lips start to swell and
you're sitting there thinking,

2526
02:27:23,951 --> 02:27:26,800
am I really going to die? Like,
what the hell did I just take that,

2527
02:27:26,801 --> 02:27:29,020
that I was thinking at
the time? And then, um,

2528
02:27:29,050 --> 02:27:31,300
you just v violently vomit after that.

2529
02:27:31,301 --> 02:27:34,810
Like from the depths of your soul and
all of these toxins leave your body.

2530
02:27:35,230 --> 02:27:40,090
And after going through this for about
an hour, you just feel miraculous like,

2531
02:27:40,110 --> 02:27:43,930
like all of the toxins been pulled out
to you and you feel energy from months to

2532
02:27:43,931 --> 02:27:47,800
come because your body is produced all
these antibodies to fight infection.

2533
02:27:48,130 --> 02:27:52,390
And I got it done about three months
ago and, and I, I feel great, you know,

2534
02:27:52,450 --> 02:27:55,900
whether I'd recommend it to everybody,
but that's just frog venom, you know,

2535
02:27:55,960 --> 02:27:58,200
a natural substance and
the environment and,

2536
02:27:58,201 --> 02:28:03,201
and they say it potentially has promised
to for HIV patients because of the

2537
02:28:03,641 --> 02:28:08,350
flood of antibodies and other people
facing autoimmune disorders. We, which,

2538
02:28:08,440 --> 02:28:11,890
um, you know, I, I believe it
could potentially have that effect.

2539
02:28:11,980 --> 02:28:12,910
It seems like it,

2540
02:28:12,911 --> 02:28:17,830
if it doesn't really poison you but it
fires all your systems on go like red

2541
02:28:17,831 --> 02:28:22,100
alert, you know, we were being poisoned
and it produces all these, like dr crawl

2542
02:28:22,100 --> 02:28:26,120
heart was saying compensatory mechanisms
that that might be beneficial to

2543
02:28:26,121 --> 02:28:28,670
increasing your health.
Totally kind of makes sense.

2544
02:28:28,860 --> 02:28:31,120
And I, like I said, I
feel great. Like I've,

2545
02:28:31,121 --> 02:28:34,570
I felt like I've had more energy since,
since I've done it.

2546
02:28:34,580 --> 02:28:35,760
It might just be a placebo

2547
02:28:36,210 --> 02:28:39,030
then we'll see how it works.
That's the problem. Some way.

2548
02:28:39,280 --> 02:28:41,570
Great guy that was
telling the healing God,

2549
02:28:41,571 --> 02:28:43,580
it was like pressing on
your back when I was like,

2550
02:28:43,581 --> 02:28:46,340
how has this word it just plain it
when he was explaining that it's like a

2551
02:28:46,341 --> 02:28:48,650
placebo. Pardon me? It was
like bitch, shut the fuck up.

2552
02:28:48,830 --> 02:28:50,780
But then the other part of me was like,
but wait a minute.

2553
02:28:50,781 --> 02:28:52,150
Placebo effects do well.

2554
02:28:52,151 --> 02:28:56,180
So you almost have to be dumb enough to
believe this guy for his stuff to work.

2555
02:28:56,360 --> 02:28:57,830
But what is it that's working?

2556
02:28:57,831 --> 02:29:02,390
Like how is it that's working and when
you talk to the Shamans that we're legit,

2557
02:29:02,600 --> 02:29:06,470
like you know you had the one guy that
likes to grab you but then you pass that

2558
02:29:06,471 --> 02:29:10,940
guy and there's this other
guy who's like totally legit.

2559
02:29:11,180 --> 02:29:13,490
Did you ever ask him how
they figure this stuff out?

2560
02:29:14,150 --> 02:29:17,450
How they figured out I Ohio Wasco?
Like what is the explanation?

2561
02:29:17,451 --> 02:29:20,660
How do they figure out how to add
all these thousands of plants,

2562
02:29:20,870 --> 02:29:24,500
brew these two together and doing a really
complicated process that takes a long

2563
02:29:24,501 --> 02:29:28,220
time to get this one thing
and it tastes like shit.

2564
02:29:28,400 --> 02:29:32,120
And yet they drank it anyway and then
have these experiences like how the fuck

2565
02:29:32,121 --> 02:29:34,190
did they ever figure that out?
It's not like they had microscopes,

2566
02:29:34,830 --> 02:29:39,090
botanists, um, apparently it was
brought to them by, by the spirits.

2567
02:29:39,120 --> 02:29:42,000
That's the universal
story I've heard from,

2568
02:29:42,060 --> 02:29:46,170
from every Shawman is that
somehow they were visited by, um,

2569
02:29:46,230 --> 02:29:50,790
spirits or beings that then showed
them to combine, combine these two,

2570
02:29:50,850 --> 02:29:55,710
um, the Iowasca vine and the Chacruna
leaves out of thousands and thousands of,

2571
02:29:56,040 --> 02:29:57,090
of species.

2572
02:29:57,440 --> 02:30:01,530
Other people say that it's mother
nature's way of fighting back against the

2573
02:30:01,531 --> 02:30:03,110
insanity of mankind.
Wow.

2574
02:30:03,300 --> 02:30:07,470
That I you ask is actually
was made by the plants and,

2575
02:30:07,471 --> 02:30:10,920
and somehow that plant spirit was given
to the people to show them how to make

2576
02:30:10,921 --> 02:30:13,950
it and buy some beliefs.
The ius,

2577
02:30:13,951 --> 02:30:16,050
got to know if you're
familiar with epigenetics,

2578
02:30:16,500 --> 02:30:17,850
but when you have a lot of trauma,

2579
02:30:17,851 --> 02:30:22,350
it actually changes your DNA and it
makes you more prone to be depressed or,

2580
02:30:22,351 --> 02:30:24,960
or insane. And so, uh,

2581
02:30:24,961 --> 02:30:29,640
by some shamans beliefs that WASC is
actually getting in one man at a time and

2582
02:30:29,641 --> 02:30:34,641
restructuring our DNA and getting rid
of all of this negative epigenetics and,

2583
02:30:34,890 --> 02:30:38,220
and just, it's just mother nature's way
of fighting back against the insanity.

2584
02:30:38,850 --> 02:30:42,030
And so, so I get different stories
from every, every Shawman but the,

2585
02:30:42,330 --> 02:30:46,830
the epigenetics one tends to be the more
a common denominator that I've heard

2586
02:30:46,831 --> 02:30:50,340
from several of them that they believe
it is actually mother nature fighting

2587
02:30:50,341 --> 02:30:55,170
back and trying to, uh, heal
us, heal our limbic systems.

2588
02:30:55,320 --> 02:30:57,800
So we don't have this
collective madness anymore.

2589
02:30:57,840 --> 02:31:00,150
One person at a time who knows
how long that's going to take.

2590
02:31:00,450 --> 02:31:03,840
They're on a different time schedule.
Maybe it's a thousand years, but,

2591
02:31:03,870 --> 02:31:06,900
but it is working one person at a time.
You know,

2592
02:31:06,901 --> 02:31:11,490
I've met people who've had profound,
uh, miracles on these substances.

2593
02:31:11,491 --> 02:31:15,540
I've also met people who haven't, you
know, but it's not for schizophrenia.

2594
02:31:15,690 --> 02:31:17,730
It's not for people using antidepressants.

2595
02:31:17,731 --> 02:31:21,150
You have to make sure you're
off the medicines. It could,
it could kill you. Um,

2596
02:31:21,480 --> 02:31:23,620
but uh, that's important point. Yeah.

2597
02:31:23,670 --> 02:31:26,440
And a lot of they do when people
go down there, if, uh, they,

2598
02:31:26,450 --> 02:31:30,210
they're on antidepressants. Do
People like that? They ask, they do,

2599
02:31:30,240 --> 02:31:32,940
they make it really clear
and then they ask a every,

2600
02:31:32,970 --> 02:31:36,120
how long do you have to get off of it for,
I don't know the exact,

2601
02:31:36,121 --> 02:31:39,660
that's something it'd be worth googling.
But you can't be on anti depressants.

2602
02:31:39,661 --> 02:31:43,220
IOWASCA does not like antidepressants.
That's very important there folks. Yeah,

2603
02:31:43,290 --> 02:31:47,880
very important. And also people who
are prone to have schizophrenia, um,

2604
02:31:48,000 --> 02:31:52,980
the IOWASCA in psychedelics in general
tend to allow that to come on earlier.

2605
02:31:53,310 --> 02:31:56,010
It doesn't mean it would have already
happened. It doesn't cause schizophrenia,

2606
02:31:56,011 --> 02:31:57,360
you are already going to get it.

2607
02:31:57,450 --> 02:32:00,360
But because the psychedelic might
actually make it come on, uh,

2608
02:32:00,430 --> 02:32:03,690
a couple days earlier or a couple of days,
a couple of years earlier,

2609
02:32:04,140 --> 02:32:06,600
and I was even next to
one woman in a ceremony.

2610
02:32:06,601 --> 02:32:10,710
He was having a schizophrenia episode
a while on the medicine and it was,

2611
02:32:11,040 --> 02:32:11,820
it was pretty,

2612
02:32:11,820 --> 02:32:15,930
pretty terrifying and so reaffirmed my
belief to make sure to mention to people,

2613
02:32:16,140 --> 02:32:18,780
you know, certain people,
the medicines aren't made for

2614
02:32:19,230 --> 02:32:24,230
Mckenna had Terence Mckenna had another
interesting way of looking at the

2615
02:32:24,271 --> 02:32:25,550
development of these things,

2616
02:32:25,551 --> 02:32:29,850
the development of things like a Iosco
that these people that lived in these

2617
02:32:29,851 --> 02:32:30,810
indigenous cultures,

2618
02:32:30,811 --> 02:32:35,460
they didn't have metallurgy and they
did have an advanced social system.

2619
02:32:35,461 --> 02:32:40,461
So as they went through hundreds and then
thousands of years of the same culture

2620
02:32:41,551 --> 02:32:45,060
evolving the way they spread
out and their knowledge base,

2621
02:32:45,061 --> 02:32:46,800
it didn't go to architecture.

2622
02:32:46,980 --> 02:32:51,980
It didn't go to the construction of large
buildings or airplanes or machines or

2623
02:32:52,261 --> 02:32:57,130
engines. It went instead plants and
that their knowledge base and the,

2624
02:32:57,131 --> 02:32:57,990
the, the, the,

2625
02:32:58,020 --> 02:33:01,080
the information that they passed down
from generations to generations and

2626
02:33:01,230 --> 02:33:04,530
they're expanding on the ideas
that they currently were aware of,

2627
02:33:04,950 --> 02:33:09,450
all involved nature. It's really kind
of a fascinating way to look at it.

2628
02:33:09,451 --> 02:33:12,930
It's just when you know
Europeans were going this way,

2629
02:33:13,110 --> 02:33:14,520
they were going a different way,

2630
02:33:14,580 --> 02:33:19,580
but the same process seems to exist in
every human culture that people start at

2631
02:33:20,041 --> 02:33:23,190
one point wherever they are at
and then they started advancing.

2632
02:33:23,370 --> 02:33:27,000
They started advancing, figuring things
out, adding to their knowledge base,

2633
02:33:27,690 --> 02:33:31,590
but these people, they did an all
entirely in a natural setting.

2634
02:33:31,830 --> 02:33:33,240
They never changed the setting.

2635
02:33:33,510 --> 02:33:37,740
The setting was always like huts and
things and living amongst the animals and

2636
02:33:37,741 --> 02:33:41,220
the being a part of this whole
nature thing. And then in doing so,

2637
02:33:41,640 --> 02:33:45,840
communicating in some way,
shape or form with this spirit world,

2638
02:33:45,841 --> 02:33:49,470
whether it's through eating mushrooms
and tripping and then taking back some of

2639
02:33:49,471 --> 02:33:51,090
that information and applying it,

2640
02:33:51,360 --> 02:33:56,360
whatever it was that the plants talk to
them and gave them this information and

2641
02:33:57,001 --> 02:34:00,870
then they figured out how to pass it
on through generation to generation and

2642
02:34:00,871 --> 02:34:03,690
explain this is what you
use when you get burnt.

2643
02:34:03,720 --> 02:34:07,440
This is what you use when that
this can send you to Jupiter.

2644
02:34:09,490 --> 02:34:14,490
I agree that nature has something for
every single element that we face.

2645
02:34:14,670 --> 02:34:14,880
And,

2646
02:34:14,880 --> 02:34:19,240
and what's so sad to mentioning that
about the indigenous cultures living close

2647
02:34:19,241 --> 02:34:19,691
to nature,

2648
02:34:19,691 --> 02:34:23,890
actually connecting with this healing
energy is how much we've come apart from

2649
02:34:23,891 --> 02:34:27,490
that, especially here in Los
Angeles. He know, you think, um,

2650
02:34:27,730 --> 02:34:30,700
there's this website I was
looking on a couple of weeks ago,

2651
02:34:30,701 --> 02:34:35,590
like earthing.com where people are
actually so disconnected from nature that

2652
02:34:35,591 --> 02:34:38,380
they're buying earthing mats,
um,

2653
02:34:38,381 --> 02:34:42,670
that have like a wire connected out
to the backyard under their beds.

2654
02:34:43,720 --> 02:34:46,040
If you think about it
too, like some people, uh,

2655
02:34:46,090 --> 02:34:48,550
something I've been trying to
do is just go around barefoot,

2656
02:34:48,551 --> 02:34:51,520
walk through the grass, really try
to connect with the earth, you know,

2657
02:34:51,521 --> 02:34:53,770
to allow that energy and
knowledge to go through you.

2658
02:34:54,250 --> 02:34:58,990
But some people might spend years
without their feet actually touching the

2659
02:34:58,991 --> 02:34:59,411
earth.

2660
02:34:59,411 --> 02:35:04,411
And it's just so crazy to think how far
we've become removed from nature that we

2661
02:35:04,451 --> 02:35:09,010
have to buy earthing mats to put in
our beds or put, put under your, uh,

2662
02:35:09,011 --> 02:35:12,700
your, your chair while you're at
your computer. That's pretty stupid.

2663
02:35:13,280 --> 02:35:18,280
It's just we've just lost this connection
and I think in the process we've lost

2664
02:35:18,911 --> 02:35:21,970
our sanity and we need to get that
back and that's why we need to start

2665
02:35:21,971 --> 02:35:26,000
reevaluating these plants and start
integrating them into our culture and,

2666
02:35:26,060 --> 02:35:30,220
and start really waking
up to how ridiculous these
laws are that you're making

2667
02:35:30,221 --> 02:35:34,240
mother nature illegal. You're telling
me a mushroom that grows on couch.

2668
02:35:34,241 --> 02:35:37,240
It all across the world is
illegal. Yeah, it's dangerous

2669
02:35:38,890 --> 02:35:41,920
and it just is. It's, it's insane.

2670
02:35:41,990 --> 02:35:44,540
There's also the feeling that
you get when you're in the woods.

2671
02:35:44,570 --> 02:35:48,410
That's a palpable,
real feeling of being connected to nature.

2672
02:35:48,411 --> 02:35:51,260
This is a calming effect of
walking through the woods.

2673
02:35:51,530 --> 02:35:53,470
Like you go on a hike through the woods,
you're walking,

2674
02:35:53,500 --> 02:35:55,940
there's all these beautiful
trees and you see everything.

2675
02:35:55,950 --> 02:35:57,530
It's like you feel different.

2676
02:35:57,560 --> 02:36:00,260
You feel different because
you're in the vibe of nature.

2677
02:36:00,440 --> 02:36:05,150
You're like immersed in this world.
That really doesn't give a shit about you.

2678
02:36:05,360 --> 02:36:08,540
I mean, you're there. You're not
there. If this is the world, I mean,

2679
02:36:08,570 --> 02:36:13,160
it is what it is. It's not dependent on
you to hit the light switch. It just is.

2680
02:36:13,430 --> 02:36:16,550
You know, it will be here before
you, it will be here after you.

2681
02:36:16,760 --> 02:36:17,840
It just is what it is.

2682
02:36:17,841 --> 02:36:21,620
Trees and animals are running by and
we sort of affected by our presence,

2683
02:36:21,621 --> 02:36:24,650
but we're a part of it when we're in
it. And when you're in it, you feel it.

2684
02:36:24,950 --> 02:36:27,320
And we kind of,
we've removed all that.

2685
02:36:27,410 --> 02:36:32,180
We put a buildings and fence and a fucking
highway and made everything hard and

2686
02:36:32,181 --> 02:36:37,160
we've sort of separated ourselves from
this really intense connection to nature.

2687
02:36:37,460 --> 02:36:40,190
And I think that we could never really
understand what it's like to have an

2688
02:36:40,191 --> 02:36:42,710
unbroken, you know, maybe a thousand,

2689
02:36:42,711 --> 02:36:46,490
maybe 2000 year connection and the
culture that you're immersed in,

2690
02:36:46,520 --> 02:36:49,070
the culture that you
live in to that world,

2691
02:36:49,220 --> 02:36:52,430
and that's what those people are
experiencing that live in the jungle that

2692
02:36:52,431 --> 02:36:53,750
created Iowasca.

2693
02:36:54,020 --> 02:36:59,020
They're experiencing this long unbroken
connection to the actual mother itself.

2694
02:37:00,200 --> 02:37:03,230
And it could be, that's why we
have so many mental health issues,

2695
02:37:03,260 --> 02:37:06,950
which don't exist in these indigenous
cultures. Exactly. And even in the areas,

2696
02:37:07,230 --> 02:37:09,650
the towns we went to that
rely on medicinal mushrooms,

2697
02:37:09,651 --> 02:37:11,120
they don't use antidepressants.
Instead,

2698
02:37:11,121 --> 02:37:15,590
when they're having grief or they're
having a traumatic event, their life,

2699
02:37:15,591 --> 02:37:19,520
they eat some mushrooms and go into the
mountains or visit one of these healers.

2700
02:37:19,580 --> 02:37:24,080
And, and so you look at the
rates of happiness in these,

2701
02:37:24,110 --> 02:37:24,861
these villages,

2702
02:37:24,861 --> 02:37:29,120
in these areas compared to what we're
experiencing here in the United States.

2703
02:37:29,121 --> 02:37:32,360
And you have to think to yourself,
they must be doing something right.

2704
02:37:32,361 --> 02:37:34,610
We should at least examine,
uh,

2705
02:37:34,680 --> 02:37:37,910
what they're using over over our
system that that's not working.

2706
02:37:38,050 --> 02:37:42,280
Yeah, no kidding. Um, uh,
I'm, I'm really very, uh,

2707
02:37:42,490 --> 02:37:47,320
I'm very hopeful, uh, sometimes
ridiculously so about the human race.

2708
02:37:47,710 --> 02:37:51,610
And part of it become, comes from
my own personal experiences like a,

2709
02:37:51,611 --> 02:37:55,540
I really enjoy life. I really
do. I really enjoy my friends.

2710
02:37:55,541 --> 02:37:58,660
I really enjoy what I'm doing. So
I'm, I'm very positive in that way.

2711
02:37:58,960 --> 02:38:02,590
I'm not ignorant to the ways of the world.
I'm not ignorant to the news.

2712
02:38:02,591 --> 02:38:07,591
But I also am not ignorant
to the perspective of 7
billion people being alien to

2713
02:38:07,841 --> 02:38:08,740
one individual,

2714
02:38:08,920 --> 02:38:13,480
7 billion people's problems all lumped
up into your fucking head because you

2715
02:38:13,481 --> 02:38:14,320
went online,

2716
02:38:14,321 --> 02:38:18,160
stayed on too many websites and read
too much shit and watch too many videos.

2717
02:38:18,460 --> 02:38:21,370
That's not how you're
supposed to experience the
world like we're not designed

2718
02:38:21,371 --> 02:38:22,300
for that interface.

2719
02:38:22,301 --> 02:38:25,630
The interface were designed for is the
interface you experience when you go on a

2720
02:38:25,631 --> 02:38:26,560
hike through the woods,

2721
02:38:26,590 --> 02:38:31,210
what what you encounter is what is real
in your own perceptions. These are,

2722
02:38:31,211 --> 02:38:32,980
these are the things that you can effect.

2723
02:38:33,280 --> 02:38:34,780
These are the things that you can change,

2724
02:38:34,960 --> 02:38:39,960
but that's all changed itself by having
the ability to communicate and influence

2725
02:38:40,751 --> 02:38:43,210
all these different people.
With your story, like you,

2726
02:38:43,211 --> 02:38:46,000
what you're telling right here,
what you told in your book,

2727
02:38:46,001 --> 02:38:48,100
what you told when you
first came on the podcast,

2728
02:38:48,101 --> 02:38:53,050
but your experience working for a news
organization that it seems in in least

2729
02:38:53,080 --> 02:38:57,730
during the time that you were there to
have lost its way and where this created

2730
02:38:57,731 --> 02:39:02,500
turmoil and your, your own
personal experience index
by expressing those things,

2731
02:39:02,770 --> 02:39:05,980
you're literally changing everything
around you. You're really,

2732
02:39:06,010 --> 02:39:11,010
you literally effecting everything around
you with the experiences that you've

2733
02:39:11,951 --> 02:39:16,270
had and forcing change and you're forcing
it even more right now whether you

2734
02:39:16,271 --> 02:39:17,110
realize it or not,

2735
02:39:17,111 --> 02:39:21,640
probably more so even tenfold than the
last time you were on because you're

2736
02:39:21,641 --> 02:39:23,830
telling me you're saying some crazy shit,
you know,

2737
02:39:23,930 --> 02:39:28,930
are a mainstream CNN reporter and now
you're some crazy tripper who travels the

2738
02:39:29,261 --> 02:39:34,160
globe eating mushrooms and doing
payoti buttons and freaking out.

2739
02:39:35,270 --> 02:39:38,180
I just feel like such a duty
to deliver this message.

2740
02:39:38,181 --> 02:39:41,380
And I know I'm taking a risk and I know
there'll be some people who criticize me.

2741
02:39:41,540 --> 02:39:45,680
The camp though, Carl Hart had
a great point yesterday. Um, uh,

2742
02:39:45,980 --> 02:39:48,580
I keep bringing him up just
cause he's awesome. But, um,

2743
02:39:48,620 --> 02:39:52,810
one of the things you said, he said
if I have the data, um, um, I'll,

2744
02:39:52,820 --> 02:39:55,760
I'll debate anyone. I have the
data and if I don't have the data,

2745
02:39:55,761 --> 02:39:57,920
you're not gonna hear me talking about it.
But if I have the data,

2746
02:39:58,100 --> 02:40:01,100
the data's on my side. I'm
very confident. And the data,

2747
02:40:01,250 --> 02:40:05,030
clearly your personal data is undeniable.

2748
02:40:06,300 --> 02:40:07,133
And just my own,

2749
02:40:07,200 --> 02:40:11,250
my own story from where I was then
pre psychedelic to where I am now.

2750
02:40:11,251 --> 02:40:15,120
I feel like I've had a complete
rebirth and data. It's my data.

2751
02:40:15,121 --> 02:40:15,910
I feel like it's near.

2752
02:40:15,910 --> 02:40:20,820
I literally feel like my serotonergic
system has been restructured and I find it

2753
02:40:20,821 --> 02:40:22,920
nearly impossible to get anxiety.

2754
02:40:23,070 --> 02:40:26,460
And this is coming from someone who
used to have constant butterflies in my

2755
02:40:26,461 --> 02:40:30,420
stomach. I have near panic attacks
and I just don't feel that anymore.

2756
02:40:30,630 --> 02:40:34,140
And so you have to say, okay, what,
what, what did I change in my life? Well,

2757
02:40:34,141 --> 02:40:38,970
that was the psychedelic use. That was
the, the main treatment I used, uh,

2758
02:40:39,000 --> 02:40:43,740
to, to overcome this. And I,
I just feel, I, I feel like
it could help so many women,

2759
02:40:43,741 --> 02:40:47,700
especially because like I was saying
earlier about them being so self critical

2760
02:40:48,020 --> 02:40:48,470
and,

2761
02:40:48,470 --> 02:40:52,050
and really just so many people who just
haven't taken the time to stand outside

2762
02:40:52,051 --> 02:40:57,051
of their life and analyze it objectively
and make decisions not based on emotion

2763
02:40:57,661 --> 02:40:58,950
or being self critical.

2764
02:40:59,390 --> 02:40:59,621
You know?

2765
02:40:59,621 --> 02:41:03,110
It's kind of amazing if this was like a
product that we were trying to sell you

2766
02:41:03,140 --> 02:41:05,490
like the best celebrity spokesperson,
right.

2767
02:41:05,650 --> 02:41:08,080
Ever. That's like, you're
like, I'm going to get,

2768
02:41:08,140 --> 02:41:11,230
I feel like I just feel like whoever
doesn't like my message is going to come

2769
02:41:11,231 --> 02:41:14,160
try to just like smear my
credibility and everything.

2770
02:41:14,290 --> 02:41:18,130
They can't, they can't, they can't. They
can't until they experience it themselves.

2771
02:41:18,131 --> 02:41:21,850
They can. And once they do, they
wouldn't, people who don't know,

2772
02:41:22,150 --> 02:41:24,370
people who really have no idea.

2773
02:41:24,371 --> 02:41:27,580
If they did mushrooms and they had
that experience, they would go,

2774
02:41:28,600 --> 02:41:33,130
oh wow. I didn't even know. Yeah.
You know, how could you know?

2775
02:41:33,220 --> 02:41:36,220
I don't even blame them.
I don't blame them for being skeptical.

2776
02:41:36,221 --> 02:41:40,360
I think it's important,
but I almost feel bad if they don't know.

2777
02:41:41,350 --> 02:41:44,860
And I think you kind of must feel the
same way because I can tell that you're

2778
02:41:44,861 --> 02:41:46,420
very compelled.
Talk about this.

2779
02:41:46,660 --> 02:41:51,520
And you took a long time to decide
to gonna go public about this.

2780
02:41:51,780 --> 02:41:54,790
You know, we had conversations
about this quite a long time ago.

2781
02:41:54,900 --> 02:41:55,711
Yeah.
A year ago.

2782
02:41:55,711 --> 02:41:59,730
That's when I was coming back from
Iowasca and I wrote you and just thank you

2783
02:41:59,731 --> 02:42:01,320
for introducing me and told you how

2784
02:42:02,380 --> 02:42:04,320
everyone go check out this crazy.
Yeah,

2785
02:42:04,350 --> 02:42:06,070
bitch.
She listened to me.

2786
02:42:09,850 --> 02:42:12,310
Yeah. But I, I turns out
I actually, I was right.

2787
02:42:12,680 --> 02:42:15,800
And then, and then after then
I had, after the Iowasca,

2788
02:42:15,801 --> 02:42:18,240
I went to Thailand where
I was able to access, um,

2789
02:42:18,560 --> 02:42:22,850
psilocybin mushrooms that grow on
elephant and, um, buffalo poop.

2790
02:42:23,150 --> 02:42:26,990
And they're are just so amazingly
healing. And, and so I wrote,

2791
02:42:26,991 --> 02:42:27,771
wrote you after that.

2792
02:42:27,771 --> 02:42:32,390
But I took time to actually discuss it
because I really needed to try to absorb

2793
02:42:32,391 --> 02:42:35,600
as much knowledge as I could
from the plants and really, um,

2794
02:42:35,780 --> 02:42:39,440
figure them out journalistically.
Like I was on one path of healing.

2795
02:42:39,441 --> 02:42:44,330
And also another path as a journalist
and I just wanted to experience the good

2796
02:42:44,331 --> 02:42:48,980
trips and experienced the bad trips and
really figure out what these medicines

2797
02:42:48,981 --> 02:42:51,530
are about. Um, before I
came forward with my story,

2798
02:42:51,531 --> 02:42:56,531
because I know some people may hear this
and then decide to try psychedelics and

2799
02:42:56,871 --> 02:43:01,280
so I needed to be 100% sure I was
on the right path, which I know now.

2800
02:43:01,350 --> 02:43:04,620
Now you not only are on
the right path you feel,

2801
02:43:04,980 --> 02:43:07,650
but you also are putting other
people on this path. You,

2802
02:43:07,670 --> 02:43:11,620
you created this crazy website, so
explain your website. Yes. The claim,

2803
02:43:11,621 --> 02:43:12,130
what you're doing

2804
02:43:12,130 --> 02:43:16,450
now. What happened was when I started
researching about Iowasca and stuff,

2805
02:43:16,451 --> 02:43:20,020
like I said, I went to a center that
I wasn't, I couldn't really trust.

2806
02:43:20,021 --> 02:43:23,530
I noticed there wasn't a lot of websites
out there that could connect people

2807
02:43:23,531 --> 02:43:27,040
with knowledge about these psychedelics.
Also,

2808
02:43:27,041 --> 02:43:30,310
I noticed there wasn't a lot
of psychedelic journalism
because there's not a lot

2809
02:43:30,311 --> 02:43:35,020
of experienced journalists or it's just
not being funded or I mean a various

2810
02:43:35,080 --> 02:43:39,400
amount of factors that pretty
awesome airways. Amazing. Yeah. Yeah.

2811
02:43:39,401 --> 02:43:43,720
One of the most important resources for
anybody that is interested in any of the

2812
02:43:43,730 --> 02:43:48,310
effects of any of these psychedelic
experiences, drugs, medicines,

2813
02:43:48,311 --> 02:43:49,150
whatever you want to call them,

2814
02:43:49,151 --> 02:43:54,151
compounds era would is one of the best
erowid.org right.org and also maps.org.

2815
02:43:55,030 --> 02:44:00,030
They're both fantastic to go and find
out about research studies and um,

2816
02:44:00,690 --> 02:44:05,400
and, and just read other people's a
trip reports and experiences. And uh,

2817
02:44:05,440 --> 02:44:08,950
what I'm doing with this site is
creating like the Huffington post of

2818
02:44:08,951 --> 02:44:13,150
psychedelic news. So we're just going
to be focusing on the war on drugs, um,

2819
02:44:13,210 --> 02:44:16,930
accurate reporting, independent
reporting on these topics. Also,

2820
02:44:16,931 --> 02:44:19,490
we were building the foundation right now,
so we have like,

2821
02:44:19,720 --> 02:44:22,570
we want to make it like a virtual city
where people can come and sit down and

2822
02:44:22,571 --> 02:44:25,990
have a cup of coffee and chat with others
who've done it, uh, to reduce harm,

2823
02:44:26,110 --> 02:44:30,440
harm reduction also so people can find
accurate information and reviews of,

2824
02:44:30,441 --> 02:44:33,620
of different centers and,
and just find a,

2825
02:44:33,640 --> 02:44:37,370
we're going to take all these studies
that had been around since the 1950s and,

2826
02:44:37,371 --> 02:44:42,180
and send them back out to the public. So
they can get this information. And, um,

2827
02:44:42,440 --> 02:44:43,620
and I just think it's,

2828
02:44:43,621 --> 02:44:46,630
it's really vital right now
because when you Google news alert,

2829
02:44:46,631 --> 02:44:50,260
which I often do with all these
substances, I'll Google news or alert, um,

2830
02:44:50,680 --> 02:44:53,050
like ketamine,
which is profound.

2831
02:44:53,050 --> 02:44:55,360
It has profound effects on
depression and psilocybin.

2832
02:44:55,361 --> 02:44:59,680
And the stories that always come up are
the ones of the guy getting busted for

2833
02:44:59,681 --> 02:45:01,840
selling it or the rare festival death.

2834
02:45:02,140 --> 02:45:05,350
Rarely do you actually get news on,

2835
02:45:05,470 --> 02:45:08,230
on how these substances
are being used medicinally.

2836
02:45:08,231 --> 02:45:11,680
So that's what we're trying
to create with this new site.

2837
02:45:12,430 --> 02:45:16,750
reset.me reset.me.
Um,

2838
02:45:18,310 --> 02:45:21,460
what is it? What does
Emmy, it's another country

2839
02:45:23,290 --> 02:45:27,640
for this purposes. It's me as in resetting
yourself. Great Way to remember it.

2840
02:45:27,641 --> 02:45:32,440
reset.me. I mean, it's really perfect
name, but what country is it? It's, um,

2841
02:45:32,800 --> 02:45:35,920
that's a good question. We might want
to look that up. I should know that,

2842
02:45:35,921 --> 02:45:37,870
but I use it more in the,
uh,

2843
02:45:37,900 --> 02:45:41,740
I remember listening to talk of
Terence Mckenna's and he said that, uh,

2844
02:45:41,741 --> 02:45:45,460
using DMT in different psychedelics can
be like hitting the reset button on your

2845
02:45:45,461 --> 02:45:48,640
brain, clearing your hard
drive of all the trauma. And,

2846
02:45:48,670 --> 02:45:51,820
and I believe that's what
psychedelics did for me. I've,

2847
02:45:51,850 --> 02:45:53,590
I've heard you describe
them that way as well.

2848
02:45:53,950 --> 02:45:58,090
And so for people who really need to hit
that reset button in life and they've

2849
02:45:58,091 --> 02:45:59,860
tried other therapies
and that hasn't worked,

2850
02:46:00,100 --> 02:46:03,730
we're going to be providing journalism
on these psychedelic therapies and also

2851
02:46:03,910 --> 02:46:08,440
alternative non prescription
therapies. It's Montenegro, Montenegro,

2852
02:46:08,930 --> 02:46:10,040
Negro,
the government

2853
02:46:10,040 --> 02:46:14,960
of Montenegro. Okay. Hovey we're
not based in Montenegro, but um,

2854
02:46:15,250 --> 02:46:18,730
there's some, they sold the domain
name writes a lot of countries did for,

2855
02:46:18,760 --> 02:46:21,680
for sale and like Biz like,
you know, like there's a,

2856
02:46:21,681 --> 02:46:25,970
there's a bunch of them that they, uh,
they, they sold.us. You can get a dot.

2857
02:46:25,971 --> 02:46:29,600
You asked. You know, it's
interesting. Um, so that's awesome.

2858
02:46:29,601 --> 02:46:31,760
reset.me and a hasn't launched yet.

2859
02:46:31,900 --> 02:46:34,090
It hasn't launched yet.
It's still being built.

2860
02:46:34,091 --> 02:46:38,170
So it should launch within a month.
But once again, things change.

2861
02:46:38,171 --> 02:46:39,470
Sometimes if it takes a little long,

2862
02:46:39,730 --> 02:46:42,640
well you got to come on again
when it launches and let us know.

2863
02:46:42,641 --> 02:46:44,710
We'll tweet about it and
we'll let people know.

2864
02:46:44,711 --> 02:46:46,030
And we just talked for three hours

2865
02:46:46,430 --> 02:46:48,800
for sure.
And if anyone wants to go to reset.me,

2866
02:46:48,801 --> 02:46:50,690
you can follow all of our
social media accounts.

2867
02:46:50,691 --> 02:46:53,840
We're really looking for people
who are experienced users,

2868
02:46:54,050 --> 02:46:57,140
kind of the teachers who can come and,
and be there,

2869
02:46:57,350 --> 02:47:01,850
be waiting for the students and just
people who support our message and who are

2870
02:47:01,851 --> 02:47:05,090
interested in writing for us or
sharing their own stories of healing.

2871
02:47:05,290 --> 02:47:09,610
And how are you avoiding trolls,
you know, prepare. You just,

2872
02:47:09,640 --> 02:47:13,270
you just announced yourself to the world.
Look,

2873
02:47:13,271 --> 02:47:16,360
the people that listen to this
podcast are not universally cool.

2874
02:47:16,630 --> 02:47:20,080
There's a certain percentage of them
that are fucking trolls and they will

2875
02:47:20,081 --> 02:47:23,140
launch themselves upon you for uh,
you know,

2876
02:47:23,260 --> 02:47:28,260
in search of humor with with some really
fake fake profound tales of things

2877
02:47:28,961 --> 02:47:32,500
happening to them in the jungle and
guarantee you now it's going to be about

2878
02:47:32,501 --> 02:47:35,170
titty grabbing while you're out cold.
It's going to be,

2879
02:47:35,171 --> 02:47:36,100
there's going to be several,

2880
02:47:36,520 --> 02:47:41,140
several stories of what the
band was scary to me too late.

2881
02:47:41,440 --> 02:47:42,273
It's out there

2882
02:47:42,360 --> 02:47:44,610
I think for helping the
community will self regulate,

2883
02:47:44,611 --> 02:47:47,970
will give various people who there's
already people out there who I'm sure

2884
02:47:47,971 --> 02:47:49,050
you've interacted with Joe,

2885
02:47:49,051 --> 02:47:52,710
who have a reputable Twitter accounts
who've been really passionate about

2886
02:47:52,711 --> 02:47:57,610
psychedelics, who we've recruited to help
us in our forums and just help us out.

2887
02:47:57,630 --> 02:48:00,180
We also have a section on the site where
you can post links to different news

2888
02:48:00,181 --> 02:48:01,740
stories and stuff that
you find interesting.

2889
02:48:01,741 --> 02:48:05,370
So we have these people on board to help
us kind of regulate. That being said,

2890
02:48:05,970 --> 02:48:10,200
you can, you can't find everything,
so we're expecting you to come.

2891
02:48:10,201 --> 02:48:12,330
But we're,
so the team behind this,

2892
02:48:12,331 --> 02:48:16,800
we all met doing Iowasca and what we've
all been so profoundly affected that,

2893
02:48:17,070 --> 02:48:21,510
that we want to bring this new creation
forward to, to try to help others.

2894
02:48:21,620 --> 02:48:22,910
That's the new amber Lyon

2895
02:48:24,920 --> 02:48:29,630
tripping around the world number
one and version 2.0 reset.

2896
02:48:29,780 --> 02:48:34,400
Wow. Well, congratulations
on a congratulations on
everything, on your journey,

2897
02:48:34,401 --> 02:48:36,680
on this website and the whole thing.

2898
02:48:36,681 --> 02:48:40,670
I think you're a very brave person and I
thought you were very brave person when

2899
02:48:40,970 --> 02:48:45,440
you were talking about your experiences
at CNN and you stick your neck out,

2900
02:48:45,470 --> 02:48:47,390
you know, you really do. And so, uh,

2901
02:48:47,391 --> 02:48:50,460
it's cool to be your friend and it's cool
to watch all this happen and it's, uh,

2902
02:48:50,750 --> 02:48:53,210
it's cool to have you on the show.
Thank you very much. Thank you Jo.
