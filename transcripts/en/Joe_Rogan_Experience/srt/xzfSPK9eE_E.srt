00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:08,880

4
00:00:17,951 --> 00:00:21,580

If you have never tried audio books 

7

8
00:00:32,701 --> 00:00:35,011
commute.
It makes being stuck in your car or 

9
00:00:35,011 --> 00:00:36,010
stuck on a train and makes it an 
educational experience.

10
00:00:36,011 --> 00:00:40,030
It can inspire you.
You can take in some cool fiction,

11
00:00:40,031 --> 00:00:43,300
you can enjoy yourself.
Instead of feeling like a Schlub,

12

just wasting your life away,
enrich herself with audible.com

13
00:00:47,291 --> 00:00:50,680
freaks.
It's an awesome way to get your learn on

14
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:53,230
m and a.
If you go there right now,

15
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:56,740
as I said,
you can get one free audio book.

16
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:02,020
A book I recommend is called the war of 
art by Steven Pressfield.

17
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:04,810
It's an amazing book.
I give it out to people.

18
00:01:04,811 --> 00:01:07,470
I have a stack of them at my house.
And um,

19
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:12,160
it's all about the,
it's all about overcoming resistance,

20
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:17,430
which is something that holds a lot of 
us back when we procrastinate about 

21
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:17,800
things,
we feel crappy about it,

22
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:20,080
but when we get things done,
we feel great.

23
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:24,250
But how many people actually follow 
through and continue to get things done?

24
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:27,400
It's not that many.
And there's a lot of reasons why.

25
00:01:27,401 --> 00:01:32,401
And Steven Pressfield is a brilliant 
writer and the way he gets into it,

26
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:37,150
it'll sync with your head so quickly.
You'll be like,

27
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:39,160
oh,
that's my issue.

28
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:44,310
And then from then on you're always 
going to know what the issue is 

29
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:44,710
immediately when it massive manifests 
itself.

30
00:01:44,711 --> 00:01:46,570
And you'll look at it in a completely 
different way.

31
00:01:46,571 --> 00:01:51,571
I've told so many people about this book
and I've had so many people come back 

32
00:01:51,571 --> 00:01:55,231
and say,
this book completely changed the way I 

33
00:01:55,231 --> 00:01:55,231
work.

34
00:01:55,231 --> 00:01:55,231
And,
uh,

35
00:01:55,231 --> 00:01:56,140
for creative type folks,
it's amazing.

36
00:01:56,141 --> 00:02:01,141
But I think it's amazing for anybody 
because I think that whole resistance 

37
00:02:01,141 --> 00:02:03,961
thing in procrastination,
I think that sort of a plays a part in a

38
00:02:04,031 --> 00:02:06,300
lot of people's lives.
I don't think it has anything to do with

39
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:11,850
just being artistic.
He relates it to writing and art and 

40
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:13,660
creating things,
but I think it probably goes to a lot of

41
00:02:13,661 --> 00:02:18,661
different things that you do in life.
The things that you put your focus 

42
00:02:18,661 --> 00:02:18,661
towards,
things that you enjoy.

43
00:02:18,661 --> 00:02:19,510
Anyway.
Audible.com

44
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:24,300
forward slash joe were also brought to 
you by onnit o n n I t.

45
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:29,310
We got a lot of new stuff in including a
club bells and mace balls and of course 

46
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:31,390
we have kettle bells and battle ropes 
and stuff like that.

47
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,730
If you,
uh,

48
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,410
I've never heard his podcast,
you don't know what it is.

49
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:40,120
It's essentially like a personal 
performance website.

50
00:02:40,121 --> 00:02:45,121
Like what we're interested in is all 
different things and increase athletic 

51
00:02:45,121 --> 00:02:48,961
performance,
different things that increase mental 

52
00:02:48,961 --> 00:02:48,961
performance,
which are called nootropics.

53
00:02:48,961 --> 00:02:50,620
And we saw one of those called Alpha 
brain.

54
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,990
If you've heard this all before,
I swear to God,

55
00:02:52,991 --> 00:02:54,340
I don't want to keep saying it like 
this,

56
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:57,880
but there's no other way to do it.
They still clubs look like weapons.

57
00:02:57,881 --> 00:02:59,590
Jail.
You're starting to add weapons to on it.

58
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:04,060
That's just the no weapons.
They will help you wield the weapon,

59
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:08,620
but what they are is a,
they're ancient Indian exercises.

60
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:09,850
Uh,
these are,

61
00:03:09,851 --> 00:03:14,851
um,
from a boy that used to do them with 

62
00:03:14,851 --> 00:03:16,090
hardwoods like hundreds and hundreds of 
years ago,

63
00:03:16,091 --> 00:03:21,091
probably thousands of years ago.
And the awkward shape of them and the 

64
00:03:21,091 --> 00:03:24,840
balance of them makes you a,
strengthens up your forearms and your 

65
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,030
grip.
And uh,

66
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:30,090
it's uh,
a great exercise as far as like 

67
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:32,230
wrestling and hand strength and things 
along those lines.

68
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:36,400
Club bells are fantastic.
You'd be surprised at how difficult they

69
00:03:36,401 --> 00:03:41,401
are to use.
I only used five pounders throw that 

70
00:03:41,401 --> 00:03:41,860
hard to use,
like for,

71
00:03:41,861 --> 00:03:44,680
with a 25 pound club bill,
I got a serious workout in.

72
00:03:44,681 --> 00:03:48,070
It's real weird.
Like we look at weights and you know,

73
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,780
we looked at like lifting weight and you
know,

74
00:03:49,781 --> 00:03:53,080
and people are all impressed if they can
lift 300 pounds and you know,

75
00:03:53,081 --> 00:03:58,081
a bunch to 50.
It doesn't really matter if you can't 

76
00:03:58,081 --> 00:04:01,231
use it.
The stuff that I'm interested in is all 

77
00:04:01,231 --> 00:04:04,770
different exercises that have been shown
to actually increase athletic 

78
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:08,341
performance.
What I'm interested in is improving the 

79
00:04:08,341 --> 00:04:11,011
way your body moves.
That's why we're interested in 

80
00:04:11,011 --> 00:04:13,951
kettlebells.
That's why we sell the extreme 

81
00:04:13,951 --> 00:04:15,940
kettlebell cardio DVD.
We have many different weights and sizes

82
00:04:15,941 --> 00:04:19,120
of kettlebells.
We have medicine balls,

83
00:04:19,121 --> 00:04:21,820
we have wall balls,
which are these big giant,

84
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:23,130
also looked like medicine balls.

85
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:26,860
You throw him against the wall and a 
host of different supplements.

86
00:04:26,861 --> 00:04:31,861
Anything that we've found anywhere that 
we believe increases performance 

87
00:04:31,961 --> 00:04:36,961
increases your mood.
There's a supplement called new mood 

88
00:04:36,961 --> 00:04:39,070
that it increases your body's ability to
produce serotonin.

89
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:42,520
It,
it has five htp and l Tryptophan in it,

90
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:43,840
and uh,
it's,

91
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:46,570
it's great for your brain to check it 
all out.

92
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,670
Go to [inaudible] dot com.
Use the code name,

93

00:05:14,591 --> 00:05:16,410
very funny guy.
Billy bow,

104
00:05:16,411 --> 00:05:17,560
now,
our buddy,

105
00:05:17,561 --> 00:05:20,050
Yoshi,
you can't go wrong with this show.

106
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:21,910
It's a the American comedy company.

107
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:24,490
It's a cool ass club if you've never 
been there before.

108
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:28,380
It's in San San Diego on sixth street is
where at in that area,

109
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:31,300
something like that.
You could find it on Google wherever,

110
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:34,480
but it's at the American comedy company.
It's an awesome comedy club.

111
00:05:34,481 --> 00:05:37,810
San Diego as one of that.
That club is like one of the best design

112
00:05:37,811 --> 00:05:40,270
clubs in the country,
like real low ceilings,

113
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:42,520
tight seeding.
I remember when we went there were like,

114
00:05:42,521 --> 00:05:43,990
Whoa,
this place is sick.

115
00:05:43,991 --> 00:05:46,180
This is a great spot.
It's going to be fun.

116
00:05:46,181 --> 00:05:48,070
Yeah.
Next Thursday and Friday,

117
00:05:48,071 --> 00:05:49,660

Tonight.

118
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:51,880
Tonight we're at the icehouse 10:00
PM show.

119
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,800
It's a great show.
Thompson girl.

120
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:56,110
Christina pundits.
They didn't make it.

121
00:05:56,111 --> 00:05:56,960
No,
they can't make enough,

122
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:57,970
but when

123
00:05:58,250 --> 00:05:59,840
we had a huge show.
Anyways,

124
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:01,550
we have.
We have you.

125
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:06,610
We have Maddie Khurshid returning to the
comedy stage doing comedy recently.

126
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:12,470
Matt Medicaid used to open up for Rogan 
back back in the day and he was one of 

127
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:13,700
my favorite comics.
Who was hilarious.

128
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,740
Yeah,

129

All right.
We have on the podcast Dr Amad Goswami.

134
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,960
Am I pronouncing her name correctly?
Sir?

135
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,470
We're going to get to the bottom of shit
folks.

136
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:39,230
We're going to learn some things.
He's going to enlighten us.

137
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:41,450
Are you ready?
Set.

138
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:46,020
Oh,

Okay.
Experience Joe Rogan podcast all day.

140
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:57,910
We are here with Dr.
Goswami.

141
00:06:57,911 --> 00:07:00,400
Thank you very much for doing this.
I really appreciate it.

142
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:05,950
I've seen a lot of your videos online.
I read a lot of your your work and it is

143
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:11,250
some very,
very fascinating and for a person is 

144
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:16,021
dumb as I am confusing stuff.
The idea of quantum mechanics and the 

145
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:22,100
just when someone uses the word quantum,
do you find that a lot of folks that 

146
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,050
just eyes glaze over?

147
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:28,610
Well,
not anymore because you know the most 

148
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:30,240
complex,
one of the most complex complex concepts

149
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:34,220
of quantum physics is quantum leap is 
the discontinuous condition.

150
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:39,230
When that gives an idea of how foreign 
it is to a mind which thinks in the 

151
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:44,400
Newtonian fashion you don't.
Motion is continuous and quantum leap is

152
00:07:44,401 --> 00:07:47,280
discontinuous,
but it's used everywhere today.

153
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:49,270
Everybody knows.
Right.

154
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:52,290
You know if anything unusual happened,
people say took a quantum leap,

155
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:56,400
so that has the.
What do they mean by that?

156
00:07:56,401 --> 00:08:00,180
I think they just mean like a big jump.
I think they just been a big challenge.

157
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,000
It's a discontinuous jump.
They probably would hesitate and what 

158
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,291
does that.
What does that exactly mean by 

159
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:09,291
discontinuous jump?
I have to go back a little.

160
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:14,120
Okay,
so think of electrons going around the 

161
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:14,120
atomic nucleus in anatomy.
Okay.

162
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:19,680
When electrons jump from one of these 
orbits to another arbit,

163
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:25,490
it does not go to the intervening space.
However much surprising to your 

164
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:29,931
restaurant.
Mind that is just suspend your 

165
00:08:29,931 --> 00:08:32,961
disbelief.
Imagine that the electron is here and 

166
00:08:32,961 --> 00:08:37,521
then the electron is there and the other
arpit nothing in between in space and 

167
00:08:37,741 --> 00:08:37,980
time,

168
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:41,290
not so it just some sort or another 
they.

169
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:44,420
They teleport themselves or are 
teleported.

170
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:49,940
That's it.
Science fiction language capture a 

171
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:51,330
little bit,
but where do they go in between?

172
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,940
We have to say that,
uh,

173
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:57,980
they go to the domain of possibility.
That's what quantum physics brings that 

174
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:01,590
reality,
which it seems to be just this one space

175
00:09:01,591 --> 00:09:04,920
time reality that we call it nature.
That is not true.

176
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:10,130
There is another reality which must be 
called supernature transcendent reality.

177
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:13,230
Just like this,
spiritual traditions are saying,

178
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,470
just like the psychologists are saying 
in the turn of the century,

179
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:20,130
19th century pride discovered the 
concept of unconscious,

180
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,370
unconscious conscious to all levels of 
reality.

181
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:26,100
The spiritual traditions of 
transcendent,

182
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:28,020
even again,
two levels of reality.

183
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:31,480
Quantum physics in the 20th century,
in the yard,

184
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,360
1925,
26,

185
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:37,500
discovered the same thing three times 
the charm.

186
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:41,040
This time we better observe the idea and
learn to live with,

187
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:46,041
but there are two levels of our reality.
Quantum physics says one level is level 

188
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:48,780
of possibility.
Wherever taken is possibility.

189
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:51,240
Nothing concrete,
no king,

190
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:55,470
no king this,
and then this level of reality,

191
00:09:55,471 --> 00:09:58,650
who are we of course live where we find 
things manifest,

192
00:09:58,651 --> 00:10:00,600
what things look like.
They're particles,

193
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:02,550
objects,
concrete,

194
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:06,450
solid liquid gases.
All of these are concrete objects.

195
00:10:06,451 --> 00:10:08,910
We have become used to them as concrete 
objects,

196
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,110
but they begin as possibilities in a 
transcendent,

197
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:18,390
so to break it down for the lay person,
essentially the lowest form or the 

198
00:10:19,451 --> 00:10:24,451
smallest form of the universe that we 
can measure when we get to subatomic 

199
00:10:24,701 --> 00:10:28,750
particles,
when we can look at subatomic particles,

200
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:33,460
they defy the laws of physics.
They exist in the same space at the same

201
00:10:33,461 --> 00:10:34,810
time,
in two different places.

202
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:39,880
They can be both moving and still and 
they can teleport themselves

203
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:43,730
a little more complex than it actually 
is.

204
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:48,960
It's less complex than that.
Less complex than thou because we have 

205
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:52,581
to realize these objects can be shown to
be at two places at the same time,

206
00:10:56,100 --> 00:11:00,810
but only in possibility.
No,

207
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:02,960
but that's.
You have to think about it.

208
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:07,980
I try and I just broke my brain because 
to work possibilities familiar to this 

209
00:11:10,011 --> 00:11:15,011
is why we did a couple of hours to write
her own days because they're a little 

210
00:11:15,891 --> 00:11:20,000
bit strange what is possibility,
but we know what possibilities.

211
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,990
Possibilities are things that glimpse at
us,

212
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:29,080
but nothing that we can put our finger 
to it because this so they become fact,

213
00:11:31,671 --> 00:11:33,740
but right now it's just an idea right 
now.

214
00:11:33,741 --> 00:11:35,690
It's just an idea.
So it,

215
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:40,810
it begins with our reality begins with 
these possibilities.

216
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:46,490
A possibility of an electron being 
anywhere in the room.

217
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:48,470
Our knowledge is limited.

218
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:51,410
We only know that it's possible to find 
the electron here.

219
00:11:51,411 --> 00:11:53,670
They're at the ceiling maybe at here,
right?

220
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,560
I am,
but we don't know,

221
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,690
but it actually will be if I actually 
tried to see it,

222
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,430
try to measure it,
try to observe it,

223
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:05,940
and that's the second domain.
Second domain is the domain of 

224
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:09,481
manifestation.
When an observer tries to measure where 

225
00:12:09,481 --> 00:12:13,201
the electron is,
the observer will find it at a definite 

226
00:12:13,201 --> 00:12:16,000
place as a particle.
That's the manifest reality.

227
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:19,990
So something that is a wave of 
possibility being,

228
00:12:19,991 --> 00:12:24,991
having the capacity of being everywhere 
without measurement becomes the concrete

229
00:12:25,901 --> 00:12:28,120
object that we can say,
well,

230
00:12:28,121 --> 00:12:31,150
it's a thing there it is at a definite 
place.

231
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:35,470
So by only by measuring it and measuring
it,

232
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:39,610
I'm only by.
That's a very hard thing to understand.

233
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:44,850
It is very hard to understand,
but isn't it if you're measuring it and 

234
00:12:45,611 --> 00:12:48,760
that's when it becomes a a concrete 
object,

235
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:49,710
isn't it?

236
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:54,760
Just assuming it wasn't a concrete 
object before you measured it and that 

237
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:57,961
it's always a concrete object.
That's the team you hadn't measured it 

238
00:12:57,961 --> 00:12:57,961
before.
That's the thing.

239
00:12:57,961 --> 00:13:02,520
Today we have a new era of physics in 
which we can propose something which you

240
00:13:05,441 --> 00:13:09,090
cannot actually see what the consequent.
Don't listen to this.

241
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:12,190
Please let the consequences of it can be
seen.

242
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:17,580
So our theories are so good that what we
have visualized as theory,

243
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:25,230
the consequences of it is predicted so 
very well that we got to believe this 

244
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:29,781
theory.
There's no choice because the 

245
00:13:29,781 --> 00:13:32,160
consequences of predicted like one part 
in $100 million to that kind of 

246
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:36,331
accuracy.
So this is the kind of theory that just 

247
00:13:36,331 --> 00:13:39,811
boggles your mind.
We've never had the capacity of 

248
00:13:39,811 --> 00:13:43,600
predicting something this accurately.
So when the picture says that,

249
00:13:43,601 --> 00:13:48,601
well they started as possibility and 
then they become actually to have no 

250
00:13:48,601 --> 00:13:48,601
option but to accept it.

251
00:13:48,601 --> 00:13:50,520
Although I agree with you,
it,

252
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:51,040
it,
it,

253
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:56,300
it sounds strange.
I mean anytime you're talking about 

254
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:56,300
supernature,
most people will say,

255
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,250
well,
we already knew land,

256
00:13:57,251 --> 00:14:02,251
but you are not in Ireland.
We are in quantum reality where quantum 

257
00:14:02,251 --> 00:14:02,830
reality is,
Ooh,

258
00:14:02,831 --> 00:14:07,831
land also real.
That is also the thing that people need 

259
00:14:08,741 --> 00:14:09,320
to.
Uh,

260
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,250
I mean I've had a really hard time 
adjusting any of this stuff,

261
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:17,460
but the thing that people need to look 
at first I think is the idea of 

262
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:19,090
superposition.
The idea that,

263
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:24,120
what you were saying,
the idea that they have measured things 

264
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,980
both moving and still at the same time 
and they have shown that things can leap

265
00:14:26,981 --> 00:14:31,510
from one place to another.
So our real reality as far as science,

266
00:14:31,511 --> 00:14:34,120
as far as like accepted pretty much 
universally,

267
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:35,050
right?
There's no,

268
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:40,080
there's no debate in the scientific 
community about the movement of 

269
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:44,790
Subatomic particles right now.
Somebody subatomic particles involving 

270
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:45,280
discontinuing,
there is no debate.

271
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:50,430
So that becomes tables.
That becomes Dr.

272
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:52,390
Goswami,
that becomes

273
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:53,830
the laptop.
That's,

274
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:59,160
that is a real tricky thing to try to 
wrap your head around Vl trippy thing 

275
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:04,660
that when you go the smaller you go,
the more it becomes magic,

276
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:09,960
it becomes,
it becomes something that doesn't exist 

277
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:09,960
in.
In our rational world,

278
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:12,560
it's different.
More and tricking them.

279
00:15:12,561 --> 00:15:17,561
Debt.
Let me claim the full claim of quantum 

280
00:15:17,561 --> 00:15:18,620
physics is not only saying that the 
smaller you go,

281
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:23,800
but they've brought chickens.
When you realized that the reality at 

282
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,030
the macro scale is made of this small 
tanks,

283
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:31,390
so of course they affect is visible much
more easily measured in this part,

284
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:37,380
the small things,
but when the small things make big 

285
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:37,380
thing,
as you said,

286
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:39,710
microphones and you and me,
our body that is,

287
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:43,220
they're all quantum objects,
so we also,

288
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:47,750
when nobody is observing us,
including ourselves,

289
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:52,780
like when we sleep deep sleep,
no body is observing me.

290
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:57,170
Where am I?
I am only a possibility.

291
00:15:57,230 --> 00:16:02,230
The only reason I can.
I can find myself in the same bed every 

292
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:07,310
night when I wake up.
The only reason for that is that because

293
00:16:07,311 --> 00:16:11,090
I'm a macro object,
my waiver possibility,

294
00:16:11,091 --> 00:16:14,570
although it expansive,
just as always must expand.

295
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:16,050
You have seen water.
We've expanding,

296
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:19,440
you know,
in Detroit Bebo my pebble have what?

297
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:22,700
The water,
the water waves will expand,

298
00:16:22,701 --> 00:16:24,550
right?
Same thing happens with west.

299
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:28,720
The possibility we do tend to expand 
when as soon as you go to sleep as a way

300
00:16:28,721 --> 00:16:33,721
of a possibility,
but the waves are so sluggish or macro 

301
00:16:33,721 --> 00:16:37,451
objects for me to move substantial 
distance that somebody can discern it.

302
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:42,950
It'll take the edge of the universe so 
we don't discern it.

303
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:45,680
It moves like 10 to the minus 16 
centimeter,

304
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:50,980
but today with leisure beams,
we can actually measure such small 

305
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:54,731
distances that these macro objects,
even macro objects move while Newtonian 

306
00:16:57,201 --> 00:16:58,080
physics of setting.
No,

307
00:16:58,081 --> 00:16:59,090
no.
They're addressed.

308
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:01,210
What are common sense to say,
no,

309
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,150
no,
they are not moving.

310
00:17:02,151 --> 00:17:06,560
But with leisure beam we can actually 
measure that between your looking and my

311
00:17:06,561 --> 00:17:11,561
looking just great.
Second objects actually moves which 

312
00:17:11,561 --> 00:17:13,110
appear to be stressed and have a totally
normal.

313
00:17:13,111 --> 00:17:15,950
Right?
So we live in a heavy,

314
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:16,970
heavy,
heavy,

315
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:22,240
wonderfully,
a creative world wide creative because 

316
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:27,131
this movement also suggest something 
fantastic that there are new 

317
00:17:27,201 --> 00:17:32,201
possibilities and if we could capture 
those new possibilities and make them 

318
00:17:32,201 --> 00:17:35,360
manifest,
that takes prednisone of creativity.

319
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:39,810
So this what you're saying is that 
objects like this desk are not,

320
00:17:39,811 --> 00:17:44,700
in fact still what are slightly moving 
slightly moving all the time and what is

321
00:17:44,701 --> 00:17:47,850
the number that they're moving,
how far it.

322
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:50,100
It's fairly at the center

323
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,660
of mass of this table.
For example,

324
00:17:51,661 --> 00:17:56,661
it's a pretty massive property.
Moving a block tend to the minus 18 

325
00:17:56,661 --> 00:17:59,590
centimeters in a dishonorable time,
like a minute

326
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:02,000
too.
So it just sort of moves back and forth.

327
00:18:02,001 --> 00:18:05,430
And so the whole world we really do live
in like a holiday.

328
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:10,370
Well Hello Graham is not always the good
better for pet.

329
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:15,390
It is for this case because the objects 
kind of appeared in more than one place.

330
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:17,240
In that sense,
Hologram,

331
00:18:17,241 --> 00:18:19,790
the information appears everywhere on 
the Hologram.

332
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:25,360
So these objects carry information which
is in more than one place potentially.

333
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:31,470
It is more than one one place.
This is why we say that we have 

334
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:35,291
discovered a new world of potential from
which our ordinary reality is created,

335
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:39,170
so ordinary reality is not as fixed as 
they taught it to us.

336
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:44,350
If you allow the objects to go more and 
more into quantum domain in the realm of

337
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:50,360
expansion into new possibility,
that while it has not expanded before,

338
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:53,240
not so much with tables and chairs,
mine too,

339
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:57,890
but we taught tarts with our feelings.
Then we can really get into creativity.

340
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:03,620
So how would you do that?
How do you go into the quantum domain 

341
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:03,620
with your creativity?
Bam.

342
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:07,440
That's when then I have to talk to you 
about the creative process.

343
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:11,130
If you look at the creative process,
creativity,

344
00:19:11,131 --> 00:19:14,790
researchers have found that there are 
four stages.

345
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:18,170
The first stage everybody knows 
preparing.

346
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,360
That just added up.
I talked with you.

347
00:19:21,361 --> 00:19:23,490
I get some knowledge from picking your 
brand.

348
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:27,030
I listened to a teacher.
I listen to audios,

349
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:28,770
videos,
Internet of course,

350
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:31,290
and get some knowledge about the 
subject,

351
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:37,730
and then creativity such as find a very 
French thing happens the most creative 

352
00:19:37,981 --> 00:19:41,340
people that are not just doing 
preparation.

353
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:47,090
They also sit quietly and do nothing.
They really sit quietly and do nothing.

354
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:54,870
They call it the period of incubation,
like a bird sits on an egg,

355
00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:57,840
doing nothing.
See Magic.

356
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:00,780
It was a tremendous surprise.
Nobody understood,

357
00:20:00,781 --> 00:20:04,050
why do we need to sit down in the 
creativity after all his action?

358
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:06,930
Why do we need to sit down quietly?

359
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:12,030
You need to do nothing,
and then quantum physicists come along 

360
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:13,110
and realized that in between our 
thinking,

361
00:20:13,111 --> 00:20:18,111
these objects talks.
They are possibilities of meaning that 

362
00:20:18,111 --> 00:20:22,421
waves.
So like always as talking about the 

363
00:20:22,421 --> 00:20:23,430
water,
where before if a toy pebble in a pond,

364
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:27,180
the water goes to expand as expanding 
crest lines.

365
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:32,390
So same thing happens with the thoughts 
they expand in meaning become wave.

366
00:20:33,341 --> 00:20:36,660
Some multiple meanings,
possibilities of multiple meaning,

367
00:20:36,661 --> 00:20:38,850
multiple meaning expanding,
expanding,

368
00:20:38,851 --> 00:20:41,130
expanding.
The more they expand,

369
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:45,900
the more meaning this packet of 
possibility or contained and so you have

370
00:20:45,901 --> 00:20:48,340
a better idea,
better possibility,

371
00:20:48,341 --> 00:20:53,341
better probability of,
of capturing a new meaning because if 

372
00:20:53,341 --> 00:20:55,810
you have a bigger possibility pool to 
choose from,

373
00:20:56,170 --> 00:20:58,630
obviously your chance of being creative 
is greater.

374
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:04,410
This is the idea that has explained how 
creativity comes to us.

375
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:10,510
Then when the actual answer appears,
the new meaning that we are seeking,

376
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:16,560
when it appears in the pool,
and when I see the gestalt of all the 

377
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,160
new meanings that'll give answer to my 
problem,

378
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:19,670
then I fake it.

379
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:22,390
Then I choose it still in the 
unconscious.

380
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:26,350
That's where my causal power of 
creativity lies in the unconscious,

381
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:28,800
but now it becomes conscious with the 
hormone.

382
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:34,400
This is the quantum leap at this 
continuous change from possibility to 

383
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,040
actuality.
So I actually captured the new job.

384
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:42,120
I actually captured the new thought and 
and that's so surprising because it's 

385
00:21:42,281 --> 00:21:44,360
new creativity,
researcher,

386
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:46,150
scholar,
Aha insight.

387
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:51,330
You have a heart of our heart.
So the idea is that the imagination is a

388
00:21:52,031 --> 00:21:55,300
quantum realm.
Imagination takes us to the jail.

389
00:21:55,320 --> 00:22:00,320
More possibility if we can do it from 
conscious into the unconscious.

390
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:05,490
Conscious imagination is still a 
stepping stone to they're doing a 

391
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:07,660
possibility,
but if we imagined consciously,

392
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:13,070
that is like stoking the unconscious.
That eventually gets into the 

393
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:17,221
unconscious,
and this is where things have this 

394
00:22:17,221 --> 00:22:18,670
capacity of propagating,
expanding,

395
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:23,760
wavelight becoming bigger and bigger.
Pools of possibility for consciousness 

396
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:27,901
to choose from and when we choose a new 
possibility might arise or the whole 

397
00:22:28,121 --> 00:22:31,600
combination of new possibilities my 
learner might arise which are contained.

398
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:36,600
The answer to my question,
that's a very interesting way to break 

399
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,450
down creativity that I've never heard 
before.

400
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:38,580
Absolutely.
This is,

401
00:22:38,581 --> 00:22:40,720
I'm not,
although it is not that old.

402
00:22:40,721 --> 00:22:43,630
I wrote a paper on it in 1988,
so,

403
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:48,930
but you know how communication is today.
It's very complex because there is too 

404
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:50,420
much of it,
but it,

405
00:22:50,421 --> 00:22:55,421
it is a,
it is a fantastic theory that explains 

406
00:22:55,421 --> 00:22:55,421
all the aspects of creativity,
material,

407
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:56,910
creativity,
experiments,

408
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:59,010
kegerator data.
Um,

409
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:04,080
the other theories are just inadequate 
to explain the creative process.

410
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:07,450
As I said,
just very mysterious.

411
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:11,050
I call it the Doobie Doobie.
Do process because you need to do,

412
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:14,440
but you also need to be doing nothing to
create,

413
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:19,620
to create the key or the creation 
process has always been fascinating to 

414
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:20,660
me and I,
I've been saying this for awhile.

415
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:25,700
Then I think we don't understand.
We have the idea of the imagination of 

416
00:23:25,721 --> 00:23:28,210
what's in the mind as being just,
Oh,

417
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:31,660
pretend.
Make believe daydreaming like that.

418
00:23:31,661 --> 00:23:36,661
Those,
those things come to mind when we think 

419
00:23:36,661 --> 00:23:39,151
of imagination,
but everything physical that exists was 

420
00:23:39,151 --> 00:23:43,201
created in the imagination of the 
imagination is a machine for creating 

421
00:23:43,201 --> 00:23:45,980
cities.
The imagination created power.

422
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:50,980
The imagination created satellites.
I mean these are all because of the 

423
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:52,400
imagination.
Without the human imagination,

424
00:23:52,401 --> 00:23:53,150
there would be nothing.

425
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:56,240
Well yes,
and now we look at it frivolously,

426
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:59,740
but quantum physics is taking a little 
bit further it.

427
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:02,510
Imagination is a good starting point.
As I said,

428
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:05,630
lack of imagination is still in our 
conscious talk,

429
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:10,960
so we have to understand that when we 
have conscious talks of imagination,

430
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:18,640
then we are proposing the unconscious to
look at new stuff,

431
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:22,700
process new stuff.
This is what we are doing.

432
00:24:22,701 --> 00:24:26,570
What imagination takes us is from 
ordinary reality,

433
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:31,630
mundane reality that a familiar stuff,
imagination inbetween hopster.

434
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:35,180
Beyond that,
it's imagination.

435
00:24:35,181 --> 00:24:40,181
It's not going to confirm to the to the 
mundane stuff necessarily read.

436
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:43,900
We can imagine very arbitrary stuff,
so what it does,

437
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:48,910
it starts the beginning of a thought 
process where talks can become more and 

438
00:24:49,791 --> 00:24:54,470
more and more and more weird and more 
and more and more and more new,

439
00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:59,890
but they're no longer process.
It's no longer possible to process them 

440
00:24:59,890 --> 00:25:00,050
into conscious because then the 
conscious,

441
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:01,280
we just kind of do it.

442
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:06,330
We don't have the capacity.
We are still limited by what we know 

443
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:09,670
they known imposes too much constraint 
on what we can imagine in the domain of 

444
00:25:11,691 --> 00:25:16,691
the unknown,
but as soon as it gets into the 

445
00:25:16,691 --> 00:25:19,091
unconscious unconscious stuff,
more reimagine the imaginary stuff will 

446
00:25:19,091 --> 00:25:23,891
interact with other imaginary stuff that
talks will mix and this mixing waves 

447
00:25:24,021 --> 00:25:27,950
together will produce patterns,
self logical patterns of interference of

448
00:25:27,951 --> 00:25:32,951
waves.
Even mentioning super position with 

449
00:25:32,951 --> 00:25:35,300
super superpose and creating many,
many more new possibilities than before 

450
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:39,730
and one of these possibilities may very 
well be brand new that the effort has 

451
00:25:40,041 --> 00:25:42,800
been manifested before.
So it's always a mystery.

452
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:45,200
How do we go from the known into the 
unknown?

453
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:50,710
The way we go is this taking advantage 
of what we call quantum thinking,

454
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:55,790
thinking where we take advantage of the 
quantum domain.

455
00:25:55,850 --> 00:26:00,850
They told me in a possibility where a 
possibility interacting with possibility

456
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:06,200
create sub completely new stuff that has
never manifested before.

457
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:11,150
I've heard you say that you believe that
consciousness is non nonlocal,

458
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:13,590
right?
What do you mean by that?

459
00:26:13,890 --> 00:26:15,540
Well,
if discontinuity.

460
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:21,130
See,
you are already familiar with 

461
00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:21,130
discontinuities.
Now you want to know even most,

462
00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:24,420
most unfamiliar,
most intriguing.

463
00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:26,490
You know this is.
This is like Voodoo.

464
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:31,850
This is really good.
Now getting into real cracks of the most

465
00:26:32,491 --> 00:26:35,400
surprising thing in quantum physics that
surprised even Einstein.

466
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:40,890
Einstein in his whole life could not 
believe this concept of nonlocality,

467
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:44,060
which he himself discovered with two 
other later on.

468
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:47,040
How did they discover it?
How to discover just theory.

469
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:49,070
You know,
understanding what the tour addition.

470
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:54,080
He never shouldn't say never.
We could probably do the experiments in 

471
00:26:54,181 --> 00:26:57,180
his young days when he was a graduate 
student,

472
00:26:57,630 --> 00:27:00,810
I did took that.
Theories don't do an experiment.

473
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,400
No.
What they do is this,

474
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:07,460
a creative exploration of the mind by 
that day to find new ideas,

475
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:10,860
the new ideas,
and then they then to predict stuff.

476
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:16,070
So I starting a idea was,
and this is 1935 mind to understanding 

477
00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:22,130
idea,
was that if quantum objects to quantum 

478
00:27:22,130 --> 00:27:22,410
objects interact,
they become correlated.

479
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:25,860
And this is a new word that he used in 
that paper.

480
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:28,740
He and his collaborators have Rosen and 
photos,

481
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:34,470
um,
these people that really sound in that 

482
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:36,600
theory,
that mathematics,

483
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:39,900
that if two objects once become 
correlated,

484
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,750
they kniffen when they're not 
interacting,

485
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:47,960
even if they move away from each other,
even then they can communicate,

486
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:53,250
not in the usual way,
not interacting with signals.

487
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:56,460
Then the ducks fuse will,
you and I are interacting right now,

488
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:59,640
but we are interacting through a 
complexity of soundwave,

489
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:01,710
sudden electrical wires to this 
microphones.

490
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:08,000
That's all true signals,
but these objects communicate without 

491
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:14,180
signals.
So their communication use as a medium 

492
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:15,780
that can only be outside of space and 
time.

493
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:20,810
Because in space and time,
Einstein himself gave us a theory of 

494
00:28:20,810 --> 00:28:24,711
relativity which says that nothing can 
interact without exchanging signals 

495
00:28:24,711 --> 00:28:28,500
going through space and time,
but these objects,

496
00:28:28,501 --> 00:28:33,501
quantum objects once correlated,
they have the capacity of signal less 

497
00:28:33,501 --> 00:28:33,600
communication.

498
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:39,170
This is what is called non local signals
that local going through space,

499
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:44,330
taking them out of them,
how they measure that these particles 

500
00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:48,230
are communicating.
So the key is in that they measure the 

501
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:51,741
communication and the soul,
that there is no signal because the 

502
00:28:51,741 --> 00:28:55,641
communication took place faster than the
speed of light in all local signal going

503
00:28:56,401 --> 00:29:01,401
to space and time must travel either at 
the speed of light or less than the 

504
00:29:01,401 --> 00:29:06,291
speed of light.
So if something can be shown to travel 

505
00:29:06,291 --> 00:29:08,310
faster than the speed of light,
it has to be non local.

506
00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:13,670
And this is what a physicist discovered 
in the laboratory I learned in 1982.

507
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:17,330
Finally verified by Einstein was dead 
long time ago,

508
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:21,900
1955.
So he never knew that his theory was one

509
00:29:21,901 --> 00:29:24,120
day.
Not only prove to variety,

510
00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:28,650
but really revolutionized the whole 
world of physics by bringing in concepts

511
00:29:28,651 --> 00:29:29,640
of consciousness.

512
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:34,910
So what did they measure when you're 
measuring information that transfers 

513
00:29:34,910 --> 00:29:36,060
between two particles?
What are they measuring?

514
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,580
The experiment?
Is that a little bit complex?

515
00:29:38,581 --> 00:29:42,080
Probably for a store like this?
Um,

516
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:47,120
but I can give you stuff for that.
I just don't know if it's intriguing.

517
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:52,750
They definitely are also easy to 
understand because there is no signal is

518
00:29:52,751 --> 00:29:57,751
easy to understand how to detect it is a
little more difficult because you have 

519
00:29:57,751 --> 00:30:01,951
to talk about four times and Portland's 
come with a characteristic 

520
00:30:01,951 --> 00:30:06,090
characteristic called polarization and 
you get more and more technical and I'm 

521
00:30:06,491 --> 00:30:08,740
sure your listeners will get a little 
dry.

522
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:10,420
They will,
they'll run away.

523
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:12,150
But,
but we don't go that far.

524
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:14,000
Let's put it this way.
If,

525
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:19,040
if,
if we had it and address certain atoms 

526
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,140
with relationship,
then they met.

527
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:23,770
Sometimes I pair of photons one going 
this way,

528
00:30:23,771 --> 00:30:24,640
one going that way.

529
00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:30,030
So what these experimenters did one 
experiment or was measuring this photon 

530
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:34,411
over here.
The other one was measuring the photon 

531
00:30:34,411 --> 00:30:38,310
over there in the laboratory is still 
separated by a laboratory distance 

532
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:42,260
several meters.
But the way the communication went,

533
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,950
they could flip.
This is what takes,

534
00:30:47,951 --> 00:30:52,951
gets a little complicated.
They could flip the prioritization 

535
00:30:52,951 --> 00:30:56,101
access of the one of the photons and the
other for transportation access seem to 

536
00:30:56,111 --> 00:31:01,111
have flipped instantly.
They could show this by the technology 

537
00:31:01,181 --> 00:31:02,770
that we have now,
Huh?

538
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:07,800
So it was faster than the speed of light
and that shows that there's not a local 

539
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:10,150
communication that shows around local 
communication between these two tiles.

540
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:15,750
In case you're wondering what they are.
Quanta of light in this could bundle 

541
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:15,850
stoplight.
Now,

542
00:31:15,851 --> 00:31:19,270
how does that correlate to nonlocal 
consciousness?

543
00:31:19,630 --> 00:31:24,630
How to correlate to nonlocal 
consciousness is the strangest thing 

544
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:24,970
that physics is bringing.

545
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:30,440
The the reason common consciousness 
enters physics was clear even to 

546
00:31:31,871 --> 00:31:36,871
Heisenberg.
That was back in the 19 twenties when 

547
00:31:36,871 --> 00:31:38,740
Heisenberg discovered his theory.
He himself said that,

548
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:43,980
okay,
what is happening when we measure a 

549
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:46,081
quantum object before measurement,
we knew the object only vaguely.

550
00:31:46,930 --> 00:31:50,230
Possibly the object is here somewhere.
That's all we knew.

551
00:31:50,290 --> 00:31:52,780
We could only talk about possibility and
probability,

552
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:57,970
but after we measure is a change in our 
knowledge about the object.

553
00:31:57,971 --> 00:32:02,971
We know what the object is exactly.
We have measured so from vague knowledge

554
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:07,030
to concrete knowledge.
This is what the measurement is about.

555
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:09,550
Now,
notice the word knowledge was used.

556
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:12,220
What is knowledge?
Now,

557
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:17,250
if you look at the word consciousness,
it comes from two Latin words come which

558
00:32:18,341 --> 00:32:23,341
is con with and the rest of the work 
comes from the Latin words,

559
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:26,140
Cuba as C I r,
e,

560
00:32:26,790 --> 00:32:28,120
scooter,
which means to know.

561
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:33,490
So consciousness is the entity we 
twitch.

562
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:38,550
We know so in this way,
what is happening when we measure it?

563
00:32:39,201 --> 00:32:42,780
Change in consciousness.
So hence,

564
00:32:43,530 --> 00:32:48,530
Heisenberg himself was thinking about 
that measurement process must involve 

565
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:50,300
consciousness.
How to prove it.

566
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:52,380
John von Neumann,
uh,

567
00:32:52,490 --> 00:32:56,900
took the crucial step.
He showed that the to change an object,

568
00:32:56,901 --> 00:33:01,460
a material object from possibility to 
actuality that concrete math,

569
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:06,110
you could not do this with.
And material interaction,

570
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:11,560
no material interactions can ever change
a possibility with,

571
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:17,140
into a particle of actuality.
I'll think about it if material 

572
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:20,981
interactions cannot do it,
what is needed is some nonmaterial 

573
00:33:20,981 --> 00:33:25,271
interaction.
Does that mean those molecules are 

574
00:33:25,271 --> 00:33:25,271
conscious in some sort of way?
Well,

575
00:33:25,271 --> 00:33:28,880
that means that consciousness within 
consciousness must be otherwise.

576
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:32,030
There'll be duality.
So they are not,

577
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:34,070
we don't set that molecules are 
conscious,

578
00:33:34,071 --> 00:33:35,690
but we some molecules,
but have to be.

579
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:40,720
We did consciousness because if 
consciousness is the ground of being and

580
00:33:41,031 --> 00:33:42,500
molecules,
atoms,

581
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,270
solid objects,
objects,

582
00:33:44,271 --> 00:33:47,840
everything is within consciousness as 
waves of possibility.

583
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:53,080
Then we can think of this force that 
changes possibility to actuality as a 

584
00:33:53,811 --> 00:33:56,860
conscious choice because what is a 
possibility where,

585
00:33:56,870 --> 00:34:01,870
but a packet of multi faceted potential,
lots of stuff can happen,

586
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:05,060
right?
Multi-Facets and consciousness users,

587
00:34:05,061 --> 00:34:07,340
that particular facet that becomes 
concretized,

588
00:34:07,370 --> 00:34:12,370
that becomes sexualized.
So in this way we have found not only 

589
00:34:12,370 --> 00:34:16,601
the force that consciousness implies 
that changes possibility to actuality,

590
00:34:18,651 --> 00:34:21,770
but we know the nature of that force.
It consists of choice,

591
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:26,800
consciousness chooses.
And so why is non locality coming in?

592
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:30,610
So how does consciousness choose in an 
experiment like a space?

593
00:34:30,650 --> 00:34:35,650
Here is a possibility of photon.
Here is another possibility of Fortuyn 

594
00:34:35,650 --> 00:34:40,390
consciousness must be choosing them 
simultaneously because otherwise 

595
00:34:40,390 --> 00:34:44,540
there'll be no non local communication.
So the local

596
00:34:44,570 --> 00:34:49,250
communication proves that there is some 
form of consciousness going on,

597
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:54,310
but a non vocal communication troops 
that there is some form of matrix that 

598
00:34:54,310 --> 00:34:58,740
it that is involved with the 
communication that is faster than the 

599
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:02,400
that pervades faster than the speed of 
light communication and therefore must 

600
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,831
be outside of space and time.
So there's a connection that we can't 

601
00:35:05,831 --> 00:35:09,641
measure.
There was a connection that we can 

602
00:35:09,641 --> 00:35:11,891
theorize about and that connection has 
to be consciousness because it involves 

603
00:35:11,891 --> 00:35:13,010
a change about knowledge

604
00:35:13,650 --> 00:35:18,650
Gulf consciousness the same way 
universally because what you're saying 

605
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:22,650
is an instantaneous distribution of 
information.

606
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:26,160
Whereas I think what a lot of people 
think of as consciousness is,

607
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:27,690
is being sentient.

608
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:29,560
Yeah,
that too.

609
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:31,400
But this is the.
This is the.

610
00:35:31,450 --> 00:35:34,690
This is the original consciousness.
This is the.

611
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:37,290
This is the stuff.
This is the base,

612
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:42,380
this is the base to stop.
So this is why we connected to spiritual

613
00:35:42,451 --> 00:35:44,990
tradition so much.
You must have heard that the new science

614
00:35:44,991 --> 00:35:48,930
is connecting science and spirituality 
and once it gets down to the Voodoo,

615
00:35:48,931 --> 00:35:52,890
they almost have to know when you get 
down to those quantum particles,

616
00:35:52,891 --> 00:35:53,310
you go,
okay,

617
00:35:53,311 --> 00:35:55,760
what else you got?
What you got over here,

618
00:35:55,830 --> 00:35:57,270
man,
I don't want to sit down.

619
00:35:57,450 --> 00:36:00,720
Exactly right.
So like in Buddhism,

620
00:36:00,810 --> 00:36:01,820
terroristic score,
one,

621
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:06,680
just surprising lines that you hear and 
then that sort of job.

622
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:09,960
What does your face before you were 
born,

623
00:36:10,890 --> 00:36:14,150
you see the possibility in that 
parallel,

624
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:19,580
what does your face,
what is the face of an electron before 

625
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:20,100
it is born of what is the sound of 100 
clapping,

626
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:20,480
right?

627
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:22,140
One Hand clapping,
right?

628
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:25,230
Very poignant sentences.
What does that mean?

629
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:30,480
Well,
Tim in quantum physics was the sound of 

630
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:33,111
one hand clapping possibility.
The sound of one hand clapping is no 

631
00:36:33,111 --> 00:36:34,560
sound,
no sound possibility,

632
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:37,170
only possibility of sound or something 
is there.

633
00:36:37,171 --> 00:36:39,680
Because if he hears something that will 
be sound right.

634
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:44,720
If it takes the other hand,
so if it makes contact with something 

635
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:44,720
else in the realm,
right?

636
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:49,910
I still don't understand how that 
relates to human consciousness being non

637
00:36:49,911 --> 00:36:52,640
local instead of contained inside the 
brain,

638
00:36:52,641 --> 00:36:54,210
so I'm coming to that.
Okay,

639
00:36:54,990 --> 00:36:59,310
so then they say the consciousness as 
the ground of being.

640
00:36:59,910 --> 00:37:03,630
When it chooses,
we get actuality.

641
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:07,440
So when you force one,
the polarity of one to change,

642
00:37:07,441 --> 00:37:10,410
the other one chooses to stay with it,
stay with it,

643
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:14,790
and that's a concrete measure.
Concrete measurement,

644
00:37:14,791 --> 00:37:19,791
right?
And possibility became measured 

645
00:37:19,791 --> 00:37:19,791
concrete.
We're saying that the,

646
00:37:19,791 --> 00:37:22,830
that the medium that chooses is the 
medium called consciousness.

647
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:28,840
The unconscious straight at that time,
but now when the measurement action has 

648
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:29,820
taken place,
there are.

649
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:34,910
There has to be two observers with 
brains in those locations because 

650
00:37:34,910 --> 00:37:36,660
consciousness just does not measured 
arbitrarily.

651
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:38,330
Right?
But the,

652
00:37:38,331 --> 00:37:42,210
the idea of those of it changing,
it has to be conscious to change.

653
00:37:42,211 --> 00:37:45,660
It can't be just a reaction.
There is consciousness and there is this

654
00:37:45,661 --> 00:37:50,661
observers.
What I'm saying is not only we need the 

655
00:37:50,661 --> 00:37:51,900
concept of nonlocal consciousness 
connecting the objects,

656
00:37:51,901 --> 00:37:56,901
connecting the observers,
but we also need the need to get the 

657
00:37:56,901 --> 00:37:59,250
concept that at the same time there is 
nonlocal consciousness,

658
00:37:59,251 --> 00:38:02,400
nonmaterial consciousness chosen.
At the same time,

659
00:38:02,610 --> 00:38:06,230
there must also be the observer because 
without the observer,

660
00:38:06,231 --> 00:38:08,700
you never see anything.
Have you ever.

661
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:13,910
Can you ever imagine finding something 
without an observer without a censhare,

662
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:16,260
so you have to measure the effect of the
Observer.

663
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:22,220
The Observer is Austin got the presence 
of the observer changes the experiment.

664
00:38:23,490 --> 00:38:26,440
The presidents of separate which changes
the experiment.

665
00:38:26,990 --> 00:38:30,390
Presidents of the observer is essential 
for the experiment itself.

666
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:33,540
Not only nonlocal consistency,
it says central,

667
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:38,720
but so is the observers,
and you have to factor that in when 

668
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,720
considering the possibility of nonlocal 
consciousness.

669
00:38:40,990 --> 00:38:45,990
You have to factor that in when 
considering the possibility of 

670
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:49,410
actualizing actualizing the possibility 
without individual consciousness 

671
00:38:50,051 --> 00:38:53,350
looking.
No actualization ever x place.

672
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:57,550
So nonlocal consciousness is a question 
sort of.

673
00:38:57,980 --> 00:38:59,020
It's a,
it's a,

674
00:38:59,430 --> 00:39:03,460
it's an unconscious existence.
Things are processed,

675
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:06,340
but nothing concrete happens in nonlocal
consciousness.

676
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:11,700
Only when the observer is there.
Then this concretization that we are 

677
00:39:11,951 --> 00:39:14,140
calling,
we use the word collapsed,

678
00:39:14,170 --> 00:39:19,170
the webs collapse into the particle.
What does this imply that before you 

679
00:39:21,311 --> 00:39:23,830
existed,
nothing else did as well.

680
00:39:23,831 --> 00:39:25,060
I mean,
what does this imply?

681
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:28,750
So it implies something very strange to 
absolve.

682
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:33,780
Initially what it implies is that before
it looked you yourself did not exist 

683
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:38,230
before you.
You didn't even exist.

684
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:43,740
I understand that.
But can we assume that all this other 

685
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:44,420
shit was already here?
That's it.

686
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:48,640
So the looking process of looking at the
process of collapse,

687
00:39:48,641 --> 00:39:53,170
pub sub changing possibility and to 
actually do not only creates the object,

688
00:39:53,410 --> 00:39:57,170
it creates the very subject that you've 
experienced you.

689
00:39:57,250 --> 00:40:02,250
You're looking at you personally,
but to all the other people that you 

690
00:40:02,250 --> 00:40:05,080
live in the neighborhood with these,
these buildings were real before you got

691
00:40:05,081 --> 00:40:06,550
there.
No,

692
00:40:06,790 --> 00:40:08,080
no,
no.

693
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:09,790
They are.
Well,

694
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:14,820
they're real as possibility,
but that not real as actually in your 

695
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:17,380
world or in the world period.
Or is your world the whole world?

696
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:20,620
Will it?
Somebodies got to be present in order to

697
00:40:20,621 --> 00:40:25,621
get.
Actually I cannot say that only me can 

698
00:40:25,621 --> 00:40:25,621
create actually.

699
00:40:25,621 --> 00:40:29,490
Then you'll be in trouble.
You're essentially saying that if you'd 

700
00:40:29,490 --> 00:40:29,490
never seen something,
it doesn't exist.

701
00:40:29,490 --> 00:40:30,800
No,
I get there.

702
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:34,870
I'm not saying me personally,
but a sentient objects.

703
00:40:34,930 --> 00:40:39,490
Someone someone has to observe before 
possibility become sexuality.

704
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:41,910
Well,
someone has to make it somewhat.

705
00:40:41,911 --> 00:40:46,911
There's a building,
so we are sort of the quantum 

706
00:40:46,911 --> 00:40:46,911
connection,
right?

707
00:40:46,911 --> 00:40:49,000
We have the quantum connection to 
consciousness,

708
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:52,060
consciousness,
nonlocal consciousness all exists,

709
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:53,170
right?
Right,

710
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:58,440
but that does not change possibility to 
actuality only in the presence of a 

711
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:03,121
concrete observer.
Mostability changes to actually put two 

712
00:41:03,121 --> 00:41:07,411
and two together.
So what happens in the presence of an 

713
00:41:07,411 --> 00:41:10,240
observer,
Nalco nonlocal consciousness collapses,

714
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:14,350
gives us our clarity.
Without Observer,

715
00:41:14,470 --> 00:41:17,530
there is no collapsed update possibility
into actuality,

716
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:20,560
but then look at it from the other angle
without collapsed.

717
00:41:20,590 --> 00:41:22,440
What is the Observer?
There is no concrete.

718
00:41:22,450 --> 00:41:24,280
Brain.
Brain is just a possibility.

719
00:41:24,870 --> 00:41:29,870
This circularity is the key to 
understanding who I quantum measurement 

720
00:41:29,951 --> 00:41:33,650
can takes place in the brain,
the circularity,

721
00:41:33,651 --> 00:41:35,810
this circular kind of logic.

722
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:40,900
The circular logic is what manifests 
what manifest reality from possibility 

723
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:46,600
it all of these devices like the human 
brain or human living or living Celt,

724
00:41:47,210 --> 00:41:51,080
living cell of an Amoeba,
even simpler stock pictures,

725
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:56,620
all this heavy mysterious entities that 
we have theorized about but could not 

726
00:41:58,911 --> 00:42:03,020
explain the basic characteristic late 
life sanctions.

727
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:08,230
Now we can understand how they occur.
They occur to quantum measurement 

728
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:12,020
involving the circular logic.
Dark Hofstetter,

729
00:42:12,021 --> 00:42:14,310
who is an artificial intelligence 
researcher,

730
00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:17,460
wrote a marvelous book in 1988 called 
Godel Escher,

731
00:42:17,461 --> 00:42:19,470
Bach in this book,
conductor.

732
00:42:20,090 --> 00:42:24,100
These circular logical systems as 
tangled hierarchies,

733
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:29,330
so as surprising as it sounds to joe and
I'll just throw out to you,

734
00:42:29,930 --> 00:42:34,930
brain has a tangled hierarchy within it.
This is a specialty and because it has 

735
00:42:36,471 --> 00:42:41,471
that,
it is capable of experiencing 

736
00:42:41,471 --> 00:42:44,890
consciousness as being the subject.
It captures the subject of 

737
00:42:45,381 --> 00:42:50,381
consciousness.
Consciousness identifies with the brain 

738
00:42:50,381 --> 00:42:54,730
and brain.
When the brain is involved in the 

739
00:42:54,730 --> 00:42:56,840
measurement process,
we who are carrying that brain will say,

740
00:42:56,841 --> 00:43:01,841
I look,
I'm looking at the electronic just as 

741
00:43:01,841 --> 00:43:05,891
you will brain looking at me.
So I'm looking at Ahmed as I'm looking 

742
00:43:05,891 --> 00:43:07,850
at Joe.
Where does that come from?

743
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:10,310
Before the measurement,
we are just consciousness,

744
00:43:10,370 --> 00:43:12,860
nonlocal consciousness and possibilities
within it.

745
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:16,720
I understand that,
but I also understand that although I've

746
00:43:16,721 --> 00:43:21,721
never been to downtown Detroit,
it's real dudes have been there to take 

747
00:43:21,721 --> 00:43:22,270
pictures.
In fact,

748
00:43:22,271 --> 00:43:23,950
people built it and they wrote books 
about it,

749
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:29,280
so I don't have to go there to 
experience it as an observer to know 

750
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:31,080
that it exists.
Someone,

751
00:43:31,930 --> 00:43:33,850
someone has,
someone had to,

752
00:43:34,170 --> 00:43:39,170
if everybody and try to all of the 
sudden just fall asleep including all 

753
00:43:39,541 --> 00:43:44,541
sentient creatures,
then there will be no concrete detroit.

754
00:43:44,730 --> 00:43:48,690
That does not mean that they.
When the truck comes to life again comes

755
00:43:48,691 --> 00:43:52,140
to our consciousness again,
as objects,

756
00:43:52,170 --> 00:43:55,830
it will become a different detroit.
No changes don't occur that fast.

757
00:43:55,831 --> 00:44:00,831
You remember the waves of possibility 
are very sluggish for macroscopic 

758
00:44:01,021 --> 00:44:06,021
objects,
so they try to capture will appear at 

759
00:44:06,021 --> 00:44:07,440
the same place,
at the same colors,

760
00:44:07,441 --> 00:44:10,170
the same houses,
the same streets and all of that.

761
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:15,120
Except that mistake occurs in thinking 
that is always there.

762
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:16,860
It's there.

763
00:44:17,810 --> 00:44:22,810
I still am not understanding how the 
human consciousness could be measured or

764
00:44:26,270 --> 00:44:31,270
proven to be nonlocal when the brain,
what we believe is the center of all 

765
00:44:31,741 --> 00:44:32,550
this activity

766
00:44:32,550 --> 00:44:37,550
that we equate the consciousness.
This is a very effected if it's shut 

767
00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:40,140
off,
if it's damaged and know that it affects

768
00:44:40,141 --> 00:44:42,930
consciousness profoundly.
So what is,

769
00:44:43,170 --> 00:44:48,170
what is the basis for believing that 
this consciousness is not proven 

770
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:52,380
theories.
I'm out just asking like what?

771
00:44:53,540 --> 00:44:55,160
Let's turn our light.
What we're really saying.

772
00:44:55,460 --> 00:45:00,460
So I at the brain make it a presentation
of that consciousness that we are 

773
00:45:01,161 --> 00:45:04,130
calling nonlocal.
So you build a picture of what it is.

774
00:45:04,131 --> 00:45:06,260
Same for everybody.
It's like,

775
00:45:06,261 --> 00:45:08,090
think of it as the,
you know,

776
00:45:08,670 --> 00:45:10,570
you have seen our archipelago,
right?

777
00:45:10,670 --> 00:45:15,670
The island stand out over the ocean,
but underneath all the islands are 

778
00:45:15,670 --> 00:45:19,691
connected.
So think of as connected by this 

779
00:45:19,691 --> 00:45:22,640
overarching nonlocal consciousness,
but then we are also individual brains,

780
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:23,930
right?
We're making.

781
00:45:23,931 --> 00:45:28,931
Each of us are making a representation 
of the consciousness that we call our 

782
00:45:28,931 --> 00:45:32,480
subject taught.
I'm a subject to the object,

783
00:45:32,630 --> 00:45:37,630
but I'm an object.
We use the subject so we both have that 

784
00:45:37,630 --> 00:45:41,551
as a profit.
How do we know that we are non locally 

785
00:45:41,551 --> 00:45:43,130
connected,
so a neurophysiologist or the university

786
00:45:43,131 --> 00:45:45,560
or Mexico,
the verified this.

787
00:45:45,710 --> 00:45:47,150
How do we know?
Well,

788
00:45:47,270 --> 00:45:52,270
let's meditate together.
He said with the idea that we will be 

789
00:45:52,270 --> 00:45:57,190
communicating without signals directly 
without signals,

790
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:02,920
so we meditate for 20 minutes.
Then we're sent over to what is called 

791
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:05,780
faraday cages.
The cages are cages chambers,

792
00:46:05,930 --> 00:46:09,050
which are electromagnetically in 
pervious.

793
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:13,580
No electromagnetic wave can go through 
the walls of this package,

794
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:16,550
so you and I are sitting in individual 
product pages.

795
00:46:16,551 --> 00:46:21,551
What that means is that we cannot 
communicate with any kind of 

796
00:46:21,551 --> 00:46:21,551
electromagnetic signals

797
00:46:21,551 --> 00:46:23,950
so you can't send a message,
a text message,

798
00:46:23,951 --> 00:46:24,210
you

799
00:46:24,210 --> 00:46:27,010
cannot send a message,
you can extend an electromagnetic method

800
00:46:27,030 --> 00:46:27,720
thinking,
get it,

801
00:46:27,870 --> 00:46:32,870
nothing can get in,
but we are still meditating with the 

802
00:46:32,870 --> 00:46:35,211
idea that somehow we'll communicate 
directly without signals and now are 

803
00:46:36,241 --> 00:46:39,720
both of our brains that are connected to
individual eeg machines,

804
00:46:39,810 --> 00:46:42,100
electroencephalogram,
Mr.

805
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:47,240
brainwaves and one of the subjects is 
shown a series of light flashes that of 

806
00:46:48,631 --> 00:46:53,631
course will produce electrical activity 
in the occipital area of the brain and 

807
00:46:53,631 --> 00:46:55,860
the brain web operators,
the Ge will pick it up,

808
00:46:56,240 --> 00:47:01,240
have heard it.
It appears in time come in in a graph 

809
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:05,361
which is called a evoked potential.
When we extract the signal out of all 

810
00:47:05,361 --> 00:47:09,180
the brainwaves,
eliminating the noise so far,

811
00:47:09,181 --> 00:47:13,160
no surprise.
The other subject is not fun.

812
00:47:13,170 --> 00:47:15,660
This is what the surprises,
so please listen carefully.

813
00:47:15,990 --> 00:47:19,110
The other subject is not shown.
A series of light flashes,

814
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:20,310
no light process at all.

815
00:47:20,490 --> 00:47:25,490
The other subject is connected with 
first subject only via this intention 

816
00:47:25,490 --> 00:47:29,980
meditation.
We will have direct communication.

817
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:32,710
So how do you know direct communication 
has occurred?

818
00:47:33,190 --> 00:47:37,870
The brain with some this subject not 
exposed to light waves,

819
00:47:38,350 --> 00:47:43,350
just brainwaves of this subject was 
vegetating basically are picked up from 

820
00:47:43,841 --> 00:47:48,841
the electrodes.
We were a machine connected to that 

821
00:47:48,841 --> 00:47:49,780
brain and then analyzed in exactly the 
same way.

822
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:52,000
Eliminate the noise,
extract the signal.

823
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:58,500
The two signals extracted,
one from a subject who has seen light 

824
00:47:59,681 --> 00:48:04,681
flashes,
one promise object which has not seen 

825
00:48:04,681 --> 00:48:07,601
light flashes.
The tool can be extracted potentials.

826
00:48:08,470 --> 00:48:13,470
One is the evoke potential.
The other one's called transferred 

827
00:48:13,470 --> 00:48:17,010
potential.
They overlap almost exactly like 70 

828
00:48:17,711 --> 00:48:21,440
percent overlap is often the same.
Eighty percent overlap of on sale.

829
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:26,880
It's amazing.
They'll not only have the same strength 

830
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:26,880
but also the same place.

831
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:29,400
So explain to the layman this,
this,

832
00:48:29,401 --> 00:48:31,980
this.
They're experiencing light flashes.

833
00:48:32,030 --> 00:48:35,560
The only one is experiencing one.
One is experience land,

834
00:48:35,570 --> 00:48:38,130
not just the other one.
One is all right,

835
00:48:38,340 --> 00:48:41,980
but the other one is has a reaction in 
his mind,

836
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:44,760
his brain and new way.
No,

837
00:48:44,790 --> 00:48:45,870
the light flashes

838
00:48:46,050 --> 00:48:49,920
reaction in his brain anyway,
which shows that the effect of the light

839
00:48:49,921 --> 00:48:54,921
flashes electrical activity somehow 
without signals has been transferred 

840
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:58,740
from one brain to the other.

841
00:48:59,030 --> 00:49:04,030
Why was it then?
I'm assume that consciousness is 

842
00:49:04,030 --> 00:49:07,640
nonlocal fat for we.
We say that the two brains are on 

843
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:12,410
locally connected.
Han locally connected on locally 

844
00:49:12,410 --> 00:49:14,240
connected Matrix is what we call 
consciousness.

845
00:49:14,330 --> 00:49:19,160
Isn't it possible though that the mind 
is where consciousness is stored,

846
00:49:19,161 --> 00:49:22,760
but yet it communicates mountain locally
with other minds and other consciousness

847
00:49:22,761 --> 00:49:27,761
that are also stored in people's brains 
and that the consciousness is in the 

848
00:49:27,761 --> 00:49:29,780
brain and that the non locality is just 
the connection?

849
00:49:29,870 --> 00:49:31,340
No,
they were.

850
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:32,260
They were making,

851
00:49:32,670 --> 00:49:37,670
making not quite considerable scenes 
parties.

852
00:49:40,410 --> 00:49:42,510
That's not inconceivable.
That not comfortable,

853
00:49:42,511 --> 00:49:44,940
but I'll tell you if I suppose you 
imagine,

854
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,310
imagine consciousness to be contained in
a brain.

855
00:49:47,820 --> 00:49:50,990
Imagine consciousness content in the 
sprain and the district,

856
00:49:51,180 --> 00:49:53,880
but what are you saying?
You were saying that my India team,

857
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:56,130
you're just.
You're just

858
00:49:56,450 --> 00:49:58,160
inventing another word

859
00:49:58,890 --> 00:50:02,640
to convert the notion that there is a 
nonlocal matrix.

860
00:50:03,210 --> 00:50:06,390
You want to call it mind.
I want to call it consciousness.

861
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:08,340
That's the only difference.
Okay,

862
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:13,400
because look,
there is a brain here that his brain 

863
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:16,161
here normally to loan it,
to say that rain involved something 

864
00:50:16,161 --> 00:50:16,380
else.
What brain?

865
00:50:16,410 --> 00:50:21,410
False brain contents.
Those are words we can give but not 

866
00:50:21,410 --> 00:50:21,510
necessary.
Here is the brand.

867
00:50:21,511 --> 00:50:26,511
Here's the brain.
Somehow they are communicating right 

868
00:50:26,511 --> 00:50:30,530
without any signals because signal could
not pass through the faraday cage 

869
00:50:31,550 --> 00:50:36,550
without any signal.
This brain and this brain are 

870
00:50:36,550 --> 00:50:37,070
communicating,
communicating by like quiet,

871
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:42,100
communicating with the transfer of 
actual electrical potential that is 

872
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:45,400
measurable by physical experiments,
so nothing like mental telepathy,

873
00:50:46,250 --> 00:50:48,920
physical,
physical transfer of something,

874
00:50:49,340 --> 00:50:54,160
physical transfer of energy without any 
legal transfer of a reaction,

875
00:50:54,170 --> 00:50:59,170
not in a physical,
physical transfer of information that 

876
00:50:59,170 --> 00:51:02,500
puts that not energy,
no energy actually goes from one to the 

877
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:04,730
other,
but the brains change in such a way that

878
00:51:04,731 --> 00:51:09,731
is obvious.
The synchrony in the way this brand 

879
00:51:09,731 --> 00:51:12,480
changed,
but this brand changed because light 

880
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:14,780
flashes fall under that brain.
This brain changing not because of light

881
00:51:14,781 --> 00:51:19,781
flashes,
but because this brain is associated 

882
00:51:19,781 --> 00:51:19,781
with this meditative awareness.

883
00:51:19,781 --> 00:51:24,060
That's the case.
Then wouldn't it do you justice to get 

884
00:51:24,060 --> 00:51:27,170
as far away from a city as possible 
because aren't you constantly 

885
00:51:27,170 --> 00:51:31,431
communicating with all the minds in your
city and if if they're all in a good 

886
00:51:31,431 --> 00:51:32,250
headspace,
that's great,

887
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:37,520
but if not,
aren't you experiencing the crazy light 

888
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:37,520
flashes of a million neighbors?

889
00:51:37,610 --> 00:51:42,610
The possibilities are there.
They saving how far away can you get 

890
00:51:42,610 --> 00:51:44,320
them filled in at the top of the 
mountain,

891
00:51:46,710 --> 00:51:49,530
positive to have that much brain action 
around you.

892
00:51:49,620 --> 00:51:51,500
Yeah.
Especially if they're smart and does not

893
00:51:51,630 --> 00:51:53,210
need to be so much scared.
I mean,

894
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:57,120
it's true that some of that may very 
well be true in the emotional domain.

895
00:51:57,460 --> 00:51:59,880
I actually believed that it is somewhat 
true,

896
00:52:00,540 --> 00:52:03,720
but actually I believe it's true.
I believe it's.

897
00:52:04,370 --> 00:52:06,750
You could feel it.
Look at football stadium,

898
00:52:06,751 --> 00:52:07,680
we see this,
right.

899
00:52:08,060 --> 00:52:11,000
I mean one guy becomes angry and how 
that anger spreads.

900
00:52:11,370 --> 00:52:16,370
That's spread only locally.
Most of the people have not even seen 

901
00:52:16,370 --> 00:52:17,760
the anger where it took place,
the gun,

902
00:52:18,750 --> 00:52:21,690
so there could very well be a nonlocal 
component in that

903
00:52:21,740 --> 00:52:26,740
kind of thing.
A hive mind that you experienced in 

904
00:52:26,740 --> 00:52:29,531
concerts as well.
You know when you watch a concert and 

905
00:52:29,531 --> 00:52:31,871
everyone has their hand up in the air 
with a lighter and they're all singing 

906
00:52:31,871 --> 00:52:31,871
along the journey,
right?

907
00:52:31,871 --> 00:52:32,720
Yeah.
They're locked in there.

908
00:52:32,721 --> 00:52:34,840
Man affects us in a very positive

909
00:52:35,110 --> 00:52:40,110
yes and so but,
but how does that not happen in a 

910
00:52:43,151 --> 00:52:45,730
sitting at equilar web?
Because we would go crazy,

911
00:52:45,790 --> 00:52:50,790
there isn't saving guard.
The saving grace is the need for 

912
00:52:52,340 --> 00:52:57,340
correlation unless you and I have some 
sort of intention that connects us,

913
00:52:59,890 --> 00:53:04,890
we will not be privileged to communicate
to this nonlocal consciousness 

914
00:53:06,290 --> 00:53:07,850
essentially saying so,
uh,

915
00:53:08,230 --> 00:53:13,230
in,
in less we have some sort of context to 

916
00:53:13,230 --> 00:53:15,931
put it into our own lives.
It doesn't affect us as information 

917
00:53:15,931 --> 00:53:19,080
quantum physics.
It gives it more exactly correlation.

918
00:53:20,170 --> 00:53:22,520
We need to be correlated like that in 
the,

919
00:53:22,550 --> 00:53:27,550
in the experiment that I just described,
which by the was performed first by a 

920
00:53:27,550 --> 00:53:31,200
neuro physiologist named Bell Greenberg 
at the list of Mexico.

921
00:53:31,590 --> 00:53:32,430
But,
but that,

922
00:53:32,490 --> 00:53:34,510
that kind of thing,
uh,

923
00:53:34,620 --> 00:53:39,620
you know,
his experiment dependent crucially on 

924
00:53:39,620 --> 00:53:41,660
this conscious meditative intention.
Um,

925
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:44,850
but people can get correlated simpler 
than that.

926
00:53:44,850 --> 00:53:49,850
Like in a football stadium.
People are getting correlated just by 

927
00:53:49,850 --> 00:53:51,110
simply the identification with the team 
that,

928
00:53:51,180 --> 00:53:53,730
that can correlate people on the 
Internet.

929
00:53:53,790 --> 00:53:58,790
We never see people,
but we are correlated because we are 

930
00:53:58,790 --> 00:54:02,810
some cause that brings us together.
So there are many ways to get 

931
00:54:02,810 --> 00:54:05,070
correlated.
And then if people,

932
00:54:05,071 --> 00:54:07,830
once they become correlated certain 
things,

933
00:54:07,950 --> 00:54:09,060
I believe that,
uh,

934
00:54:09,090 --> 00:54:14,090
it's easier to transfer emotions than 
actual talks and the trail,

935
00:54:15,450 --> 00:54:19,270
we don't correlate very well because 
talk rational and restaurant,

936
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:22,050
it takes us away from this nonlocal 
consciousness.

937
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:27,440
But when we are emotional,
then this nonlocal consciousness can 

938
00:54:28,141 --> 00:54:31,200
correlate us and the effects can travel 
much better.

939
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:36,500
This is why one person,
bad mood can get another person to bad 

940
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:41,840
mood or one person's happiness can be 
communicated to another person's 

941
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:44,250
happiness.
Happiness is most certainly infectious.

942
00:54:44,750 --> 00:54:47,240
Well,
one of the reasons why comedy clubs work

943
00:54:47,620 --> 00:54:48,410
better,
you know,

944
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:51,190
laughter becomes infectious when 
everyone around you is laughing at,

945
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:52,650
well,
they'll have your laughing.

946
00:54:52,651 --> 00:54:56,550
Meditation today is taking off like 
wildfire in some places.

947
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:57,750
Laughing.
Meditation,

948
00:54:57,751 --> 00:55:00,180
I think meditation.
I went to India recently,

949
00:55:00,181 --> 00:55:02,900
Bangalore and they have parks,
you know,

950
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:05,760
where people gather together every 
morning,

951
00:55:05,761 --> 00:55:07,080
like at six,
6:30,

952
00:55:07,380 --> 00:55:09,270
and they will have this lafitte 
vegetation.

953
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:14,920
It's,
it's wonderful thing to watch and you 

954
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:14,920
watch your self will start laughing.

955
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:17,990
That's funny.
You just tickle each other or no,

956
00:55:18,230 --> 00:55:20,070
without thinking like this is the thing.

957
00:55:20,350 --> 00:55:25,350
Well,
part of it of course is is local 

958
00:55:25,350 --> 00:55:25,350
communication,
no denying it,

959
00:55:25,350 --> 00:55:29,290
but that jokes and then just the way you
just start laughing.

960
00:55:29,291 --> 00:55:32,890
It was just started laughing and it was 
supposed to love so everybody just.

961
00:55:33,310 --> 00:55:38,310
But you know,
you could not maintain that kind of 

962
00:55:38,310 --> 00:55:38,380
thing for very long.
If anything,

963
00:55:38,381 --> 00:55:41,170
the mouth muscles will be tired and so 
forth.

964
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:44,320
But here,
because of that nonlocal correlation,

965
00:55:44,321 --> 00:55:49,321
which comes into play after awhile,
you can see more than what you'd expect 

966
00:55:49,321 --> 00:55:51,550
just imitating other people to laugh.

967
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:54,290
Wow,
that's fascinating.

968
00:55:54,291 --> 00:55:56,510
So these people,
how many of them meet?

969
00:55:57,050 --> 00:55:58,640
Oh,
like 50 people,

970
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:03,680
maybe 50 people in.
They just get together and just laugh 

971
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:05,461
for how long work for 20 minutes.
Just howling.

972
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:08,340
Well,

973
00:56:09,970 --> 00:56:13,010
it is kind of a very,
very amusing.

974
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:15,990
Wow.
If you forgive me,

975
00:56:15,991 --> 00:56:20,991
I still don't understand how that makes 
consciousness nonlocal I understand that

976
00:56:21,871 --> 00:56:25,390
there's communication,
I that there's sort of a shared

977
00:56:25,570 --> 00:56:28,840
laughing meditation,
this kind of thing,

978
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:30,580
the experiments you were talking about 
it,

979
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:33,570
this kind of thing.
Something unusual happens.

980
00:56:33,580 --> 00:56:38,580
It's not very difficult to show Deidre 
who is a psychologist working at the 

981
00:56:40,750 --> 00:56:45,750
Institute of noetic sciences.
Dean Radin does the following 

982
00:56:45,750 --> 00:56:49,741
experiment.
He takes what is called random number 

983
00:56:49,741 --> 00:56:52,651
generators.
These things are devices in which 

984
00:56:52,651 --> 00:56:57,151
radioactive decay is that taking place 
because are completed and as you know 

985
00:56:57,151 --> 00:56:59,170
already activity the quantum process.
Completely random.

986
00:56:59,530 --> 00:57:00,700
Radioactive.
Say that again.

987
00:57:00,701 --> 00:57:03,280
Ready?
What the activity is a quantum process.

988
00:57:03,281 --> 00:57:05,980
Completely random.
Random decay have taken place.

989
00:57:06,220 --> 00:57:11,220
These random decay is a process by 
computer to generate random airways of 

990
00:57:11,231 --> 00:57:16,231
zeros and ones.
So they are called random number 

991
00:57:16,231 --> 00:57:16,231
generators,
right?

992
00:57:16,231 --> 00:57:18,880
I've heard of this so.
So we have random already supposedly,

993
00:57:19,780 --> 00:57:23,380
and there'll be some deviation from 
randomness which can be calculated.

994
00:57:23,650 --> 00:57:28,650
The rule sub statistics gives you that,
but rather than have the tremendous 

995
00:57:29,681 --> 00:57:34,270
insight of taking these machines to 
meditative places,

996
00:57:34,271 --> 00:57:37,180
I don't know if he has actually done 
this with loving meditators,

997
00:57:37,181 --> 00:57:42,181
but he quit.
And what I'm saying is that in the 

998
00:57:42,181 --> 00:57:45,361
presence of meditative pupil,
this random number generators start 

999
00:57:45,361 --> 00:57:48,160
behaving Nanda randomly.
Nanda,

1000
00:57:48,250 --> 00:57:53,050
I'm normally quite way beyond what the 
predicted deviation should be.

1001
00:57:53,230 --> 00:57:58,230
So were they concentrating on specific 
numbers to be generated once and it 

1002
00:58:01,390 --> 00:58:06,390
should have,
you should have one.

1003
00:58:06,820 --> 00:58:09,460
Did they concentrate on specific one 
group on zero,

1004
00:58:09,461 --> 00:58:10,360
one group on?
No,

1005
00:58:10,420 --> 00:58:12,760
they didn't do anything.
We're just meditating,

1006
00:58:12,761 --> 00:58:14,320
just meditating,
just keep dating.

1007
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:14,750
And how

1008
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:15,570
perfect.
Uh,

1009
00:58:15,610 --> 00:58:20,610
the,
the random number generator did numbers 

1010
00:58:20,610 --> 00:58:21,100
degenerate.
They're not so random anymore,

1011
00:58:21,350 --> 00:58:23,170
right?
There's more zeros done one.

1012
00:58:23,470 --> 00:58:25,240
Well wouldn't that.
In fact,

1013
00:58:25,340 --> 00:58:30,340
I mean the whole idea of quantum leaping
and quantum teleportation,

1014
00:58:31,450 --> 00:58:33,730
meaning that distance really isn't an 
issue,

1015
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:34,480
right?
Yeah.

1016
00:58:34,540 --> 00:58:39,540
This is not an issue.
So why is it that with these people 

1017
00:58:39,540 --> 00:58:40,570
meditating in the room with all this 
jazz,

1018
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:44,830
that it affects it.
Whereas I would assume anytime you run a

1019
00:58:44,890 --> 00:58:49,890
random number generator,
there's someone meditating somewhere in 

1020
00:58:49,890 --> 00:58:49,890
the world,
probably massive groups of them.

1021
00:58:49,890 --> 00:58:54,660
How could the effect of just a couple 
individuals vary that much from the 

1022
00:58:54,660 --> 00:58:54,660
great.
Hi,

1023
00:58:54,660 --> 00:58:56,000
very,
very intelligent question.

1024
00:58:56,001 --> 00:58:59,000
But remember I also taught,
told about another factor.

1025
00:58:59,540 --> 00:59:04,070
People have to be coordinated so that 
local correlation is important.

1026
00:59:04,550 --> 00:59:09,550
Now,
if you correlate and then look for this 

1027
00:59:09,550 --> 00:59:13,721
affects,
send people away and they're still 

1028
00:59:13,721 --> 00:59:13,721
demand correlated because they are 
meditating,

1029
00:59:13,940 --> 00:59:16,050
then that should work if,
uh,

1030
00:59:16,310 --> 00:59:21,260
if you set up a group of meditators but 
not in Los Angeles but in Los Angeles,

1031
00:59:21,410 --> 00:59:25,700
San Francisco and New York,
but they all are correlated in some ways

1032
00:59:25,701 --> 00:59:30,701
by telephone or by internet or some 
intention given by a common source,

1033
00:59:31,170 --> 00:59:33,950
ones are correlated and they start 
meditating.

1034
00:59:33,951 --> 00:59:35,180
Distance should not matter.

1035
00:59:35,350 --> 00:59:40,350
Okay,
so what essentially what you're saying 

1036
00:59:40,350 --> 00:59:41,830
is their energy focused on this one 
thing can now be measured.

1037
00:59:42,100 --> 00:59:44,560
Whereas if their energy is not focused 
on it,

1038
00:59:44,561 --> 00:59:49,561
it doesn't have an effect on it and the 
focusing on the thing has an effect and 

1039
00:59:49,561 --> 00:59:53,840
the poker thing has been tension.
If we translate the word forecasting to 

1040
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:57,481
intention,
then I would agree with focusing is too 

1041
00:59:57,481 --> 01:00:00,331
general and Sunday the complete notion.
It's something like focusing.

1042
01:00:00,770 --> 01:00:03,700
The intention is focusing.
That to me,

1043
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:06,580
if,
if it's truly measurable,

1044
01:00:06,610 --> 01:00:11,610
definitely shows are some effect that 
the mind has to accept that they weren't

1045
01:00:12,221 --> 01:00:14,440
mind.
We use two different consciousness.

1046
01:00:14,470 --> 01:00:16,930
Consciousness.
Consciousness is happening,

1047
01:00:16,931 --> 01:00:19,090
effect,
but I still.

1048
01:00:19,390 --> 01:00:21,070
I don't know how that

1049
01:00:21,980 --> 01:00:22,880
keeps you.

1050
01:00:22,990 --> 01:00:23,570
Oh,
from.

1051
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:28,620
I mean,
I don't know how that makes 

1052
01:00:28,620 --> 01:00:28,620
consciousness being nonlocal.
Oh,

1053
01:00:28,620 --> 01:00:28,620
it

1054
01:00:28,940 --> 01:00:31,970
how you communicate.
Our picture is very simple like this.

1055
01:00:32,540 --> 01:00:37,540
You and I had transferred.
Potential electrical activity was 

1056
01:00:37,540 --> 01:00:40,640
transferred from my brain to your brain 
without an electrical connection.

1057
01:00:41,390 --> 01:00:43,250
The connection is nonlocal.
No question,

1058
01:00:43,251 --> 01:00:48,251
right?
You're not having any difficulty with 

1059
01:00:48,251 --> 01:00:49,750
that.
That's just how do we interpret it to 

1060
01:00:49,750 --> 01:00:50,900
interpret it.
How could this happen?

1061
01:00:51,170 --> 01:00:56,170
How could this happen is because you.
Although we have not been exposed to 

1062
01:00:57,440 --> 01:01:02,440
these light flashes now,
but you have in your brain memory of 

1063
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:07,361
seeing light flashes,
you have seen light fascist many times 

1064
01:01:07,361 --> 01:01:09,440
in your life and it's because we're 
correlated and no,

1065
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:11,140
no,
because you have seen them before.

1066
01:01:12,590 --> 01:01:17,590
So out of this memories,
which are all unconscious processes,

1067
01:01:18,411 --> 01:01:21,080
by the way,
whenever you are vegetating,

1068
01:01:21,330 --> 01:01:24,470
the unconscious brain,
unconscious,

1069
01:01:25,340 --> 01:01:29,320
unconscious because sub his brain stuff 
and become.

1070
01:01:29,360 --> 01:01:34,100
They become the subjects of the objects 
of the unconscious for processing.

1071
01:01:34,340 --> 01:01:39,320
So unconscious always has these memories
to process.

1072
01:01:39,650 --> 01:01:44,650
That's an interesting point.
Then what happens if you do an 

1073
01:01:44,650 --> 01:01:47,111
experiment where one person experiences 
something that they have no background 

1074
01:01:47,601 --> 01:01:48,700
in,
I've never seen before.

1075
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:53,720
Most people don't know,
nor does the other person in the room 

1076
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:56,890
who's going to receive the signal.
How does he process in that case,

1077
01:01:58,150 --> 01:02:03,010
be very difficult.
Things done memory based on the brain.

1078
01:02:03,020 --> 01:02:08,020
Memory exists.
Understanding what consciousness is 

1079
01:02:08,020 --> 01:02:08,020
choosing from that.
So how did,

1080
01:02:08,030 --> 01:02:10,430
how did shitty way to communicate?
Nope,

1081
01:02:10,460 --> 01:02:13,270
not at all.
Because what a marvelous book.

1082
01:02:13,360 --> 01:02:17,300
You have to have memory of it though,
but most things,

1083
01:02:17,301 --> 01:02:19,680
most things that we think about help,
most things,

1084
01:02:19,681 --> 01:02:20,400
they are exposed

1085
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:22,460
to have memories of it.
I mean how,

1086
01:02:22,490 --> 01:02:25,560
how many new things?
Completely new things to do.

1087
01:02:25,561 --> 01:02:26,700
Get exposed in a day.

1088
01:02:27,070 --> 01:02:32,020
I will say with this dude on a weekend 
and exposed to new shits on,

1089
01:02:33,410 --> 01:02:36,400
but grill is zero because that will be 
at least something coming.

1090
01:02:36,470 --> 01:02:40,470
I understand that there's communication.
What I do not understand the finding.

1091
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:42,280
Give the name

1092
01:02:42,820 --> 01:02:47,820
what is,
how is this memory being actualized in 

1093
01:02:47,820 --> 01:02:48,580
your brain

1094
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:52,820
as that cost or some sort of transfer of
information,

1095
01:02:52,821 --> 01:02:54,140
but not even a good one.
No,

1096
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:55,440
wait,
is it always on?

1097
01:02:56,530 --> 01:03:01,530
Wait a minute.
Remembered being quantum physics 

1098
01:03:01,530 --> 01:03:01,530
thinking classically again.
Okay.

1099
01:03:01,530 --> 01:03:06,261
I'm sorry your Tanya.
I'm being quantum physics Newtonian 

1100
01:03:06,261 --> 01:03:08,700
unfortunately,
but that is the problem.

1101
01:03:08,701 --> 01:03:13,650
We are all Newtonian when we are not 
using subtle language so you have to get

1102
01:03:13,651 --> 01:03:18,651
used to it.
I understand your brain is possibility 

1103
01:03:18,651 --> 01:03:18,810
unconsciously just giving you 
possibility.

1104
01:03:19,290 --> 01:03:23,790
So unless this entity called 
consciousness is choosing possibility,

1105
01:03:23,791 --> 01:03:26,100
it will not have the actual transport 
potential.

1106
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:28,140
Okay,
so how can you have it transferred?

1107
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:33,200
Potential you potential being 
transferred by a nonlocal meet Matrix 

1108
01:03:33,511 --> 01:03:38,511
that we're calling consciousness because
it has to be consciousness who chooses 

1109
01:03:38,511 --> 01:03:43,250
out of the possibilities of your brain 
generated by previous memory because you

1110
01:03:45,091 --> 01:03:50,091
are meditating with your partner and the
partner has seen this light flashes 

1111
01:03:52,290 --> 01:03:57,290
consciousness by virtue of that 
correlation is choosing from your 

1112
01:03:57,290 --> 01:04:01,071
unconscious which has the memory,
but nothing more than that has the 

1113
01:04:01,071 --> 01:04:02,070
possibility,
but nothing more than that,

1114
01:04:02,071 --> 01:04:07,071
no actuality,
but consciousness is choosing the 

1115
01:04:07,071 --> 01:04:08,520
actuality because you are meditating to 
receive that.

1116
01:04:09,240 --> 01:04:11,700
Sir,
I'm going to have to disagree with you.

1117
01:04:13,020 --> 01:04:16,920
This is why I understand what you're 
saying.

1118
01:04:17,070 --> 01:04:22,070
I completely do,
but I don't think it necessarily means 

1119
01:04:22,320 --> 01:04:26,940
that your consciousness is non local,
can make an alternative model.

1120
01:04:27,570 --> 01:04:29,850
This doesn't have to be an alternative 
model.

1121
01:04:29,851 --> 01:04:34,851
Just the idea of communication and only 
through through information being passed

1122
01:04:35,101 --> 01:04:40,101
forth where what you're measuring is so 
like imprecise the.

1123
01:04:42,500 --> 01:04:44,280
You're saying 70 percent,
right?

1124
01:04:44,310 --> 01:04:44,630
No,
no,

1125
01:04:44,631 --> 01:04:45,870
no.
Nothing in precise.

1126
01:04:45,930 --> 01:04:50,930
Okay.
There's some sort of a signal being 

1127
01:04:50,930 --> 01:04:52,791
transferred between one person,
another separate papers happened to 

1128
01:04:52,791 --> 01:04:52,791
percentage.
Huge.

1129
01:04:52,791 --> 01:04:53,130
I'll tell you when,
and

1130
01:04:53,210 --> 01:04:57,230
you don't meditate when you don't 
meditate.

1131
01:04:57,290 --> 01:04:59,530
Right.
The potential up.

1132
01:04:59,540 --> 01:05:04,540
The other person is vegetating is 
practically nothing,

1133
01:05:05,540 --> 01:05:08,210
so there's no transfer whatsoever.
Adrenaline's meditating.

1134
01:05:08,570 --> 01:05:10,730
If you don't meditate,
the never found.

1135
01:05:10,760 --> 01:05:15,500
They never found any turn for potential,
but whenever they would meditate,

1136
01:05:15,710 --> 01:05:20,170
all of a sudden there is the electric 
potential which is like 70 percent,

1137
01:05:20,171 --> 01:05:24,130
80 percent,
60 percent of the detect if a potential.

1138
01:05:24,790 --> 01:05:25,750
There is something here.

1139
01:05:25,870 --> 01:05:30,870
Cool.
There's something being transferred 

1140
01:05:30,870 --> 01:05:30,870
weekends without.
Without any signal.

1141
01:05:30,920 --> 01:05:33,190
I totally appreciate

1142
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:38,430
matrix between the two people.
I'm just giving it a name.

1143
01:05:38,460 --> 01:05:40,650
That metrics we call consciousness,
right?

1144
01:05:40,680 --> 01:05:42,480
Because what is happening in the.
In the.

1145
01:05:42,570 --> 01:05:46,080
In the two people consciousness,
remember the vehicle to know it,

1146
01:05:46,260 --> 01:05:51,260
so what is happening is that something 
is being transferred which has no basis 

1147
01:05:52,471 --> 01:05:57,471
for the transfer.
Transfer takes energy that is already 

1148
01:05:57,471 --> 01:06:00,351
usually experienced here is transfer,
taking place without any energy 

1149
01:06:00,351 --> 01:06:01,070
transfer,
without any signal transfer,

1150
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:06,280
holding the understanding because the 
possibility of that is already there in 

1151
01:06:06,280 --> 01:06:09,921
the other brain and consciousness is 
choosing the possibility and making it 

1152
01:06:09,921 --> 01:06:09,921
actual.
How is

1153
01:06:09,921 --> 01:06:12,720
is that any different than distributing 
information?

1154
01:06:13,380 --> 01:06:18,380
How is it any different than one person 
has an experience and relays that 

1155
01:06:18,380 --> 01:06:20,250
experience through information to the 
other person,

1156
01:06:20,460 --> 01:06:25,460
cannot local signals through something,
some sort of a connection?

1157
01:06:26,100 --> 01:06:31,100
Yeah,
look at signals that even but not like 

1158
01:06:31,100 --> 01:06:31,100
sound signals are being able to 
communicate.

1159
01:06:31,100 --> 01:06:34,290
I mean in the meditative state,
ics exchanging information.

1160
01:06:34,320 --> 01:06:37,860
If it is not local thickness than it is 
consciousness only.

1161
01:06:38,610 --> 01:06:42,180
Now you got to getting it.
You're just objecting to language,

1162
01:06:42,290 --> 01:06:42,520
but

1163
01:06:42,620 --> 01:06:47,620
does the person who is sitting in the 
other room who's receiving these 

1164
01:06:47,620 --> 01:06:47,990
signals,
do they have a memory of this?

1165
01:06:48,010 --> 01:06:49,910
If there's,
is there a cognitive impact?

1166
01:06:50,490 --> 01:06:54,910
Devastate definite signal that I'm 
detecting for this brain.

1167
01:06:55,190 --> 01:06:57,180
Does the person aware of it who detects 
it?

1168
01:06:57,420 --> 01:06:59,990
The patient there is no cognitive

1169
01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:03,380
mission and the other person because the
brain is so complex,

1170
01:07:03,381 --> 01:07:07,540
unless you focus on something that we 
will never,

1171
01:07:07,580 --> 01:07:12,560
we have not yet been able to isolate a 
cognitive change and the person.

1172
01:07:12,890 --> 01:07:17,890
See that's where I'm having a hard time 
making the leap between what I 

1173
01:07:17,890 --> 01:07:20,580
understand to be a clear sense of some 
sort of a communication,

1174
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:24,030
but how does that mean that all 
consciousness is long,

1175
01:07:24,060 --> 01:07:29,060
non local?
How does that not mean some real new 

1176
01:07:29,060 --> 01:07:31,830
form of communication that is evolving 
inside the human body

1177
01:07:33,830 --> 01:07:35,540
already got the language.

1178
01:07:35,780 --> 01:07:37,120
I'm sorry,
but I mean no,

1179
01:07:37,190 --> 01:07:39,140
it's that new form.
Exactly right.

1180
01:07:39,230 --> 01:07:41,180
Am I getting Newtonian?
Did I go Newtonian on,

1181
01:07:41,181 --> 01:07:42,700
Ya know,
if Tony,

1182
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:47,880
they send you a farmer saying that it's 
but it's rudimentary right now.

1183
01:07:50,060 --> 01:07:51,650
I'm just giving it a name.
Okay.

1184
01:07:51,710 --> 01:07:54,920
You agreed that there is something.
If you're telling me,

1185
01:07:54,921 --> 01:07:57,410
you're telling me I'm.
I don't understand any of this.

1186
01:07:57,740 --> 01:08:02,740
I agree that in your story and your 
story and your experience,

1187
01:08:04,700 --> 01:08:07,370
sorry you all many times and

1188
01:08:07,370 --> 01:08:12,370
factually during this broadcast,
without signals at times for up 

1189
01:08:13,420 --> 01:08:15,680
information or transfer of

1190
01:08:16,070 --> 01:08:17,990
you have put the electric potential

1191
01:08:18,200 --> 01:08:20,560
completely based on your story.
I mean,

1192
01:08:21,150 --> 01:08:24,230
spending mental data.
I don't mean the story.

1193
01:08:24,231 --> 01:08:26,900
That's a bad word for it.
I have your information that you're.

1194
01:08:27,050 --> 01:08:30,430
You're presenting experimental data to 
in 2011.

1195
01:08:31,110 --> 01:08:32,820
Birth order is in different parts of the
world,

1196
01:08:33,270 --> 01:08:38,270
what we call this matrix of times times 
far up signals.

1197
01:08:39,030 --> 01:08:41,340
Yes.
East Ohio had our differences.

1198
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:43,570
Yes.
That's what I'm saying is that it is.

1199
01:08:43,650 --> 01:08:48,650
If you look at the rest of our theory,
because it takes consciousness.

1200
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:52,740
Anything information.
So we call this matrix consciousness.

1201
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:53,780
Hmm.
Okay.

1202
01:08:53,960 --> 01:08:56,810
And in fact the person is receiving it 
on the other end.

1203
01:08:56,811 --> 01:09:00,470
Even though consciousness is non local,
the other person isn't even conscious.

1204
01:09:00,500 --> 01:09:05,500
They're receiving it.
If you want to look at it that way or 

1205
01:09:05,500 --> 01:09:05,500
cognizant

1206
01:09:05,500 --> 01:09:05,500
that would not fit help.
Hey,

1207
01:09:05,500 --> 01:09:08,850
let's put the experiment.
Remember people already have data,

1208
01:09:08,910 --> 01:09:10,800
extensive data up telepathy.

1209
01:09:12,760 --> 01:09:15,960
What's the most convincing data of 
telepathy that you've experienced?

1210
01:09:17,030 --> 01:09:19,000
I have myself experienced,
uh,

1211
01:09:19,100 --> 01:09:20,720
or,
or that you know,

1212
01:09:21,950 --> 01:09:23,150
again,
it's subjective,

1213
01:09:23,151 --> 01:09:25,370
so people up to object,
but,

1214
01:09:25,540 --> 01:09:26,780
uh,
this,

1215
01:09:26,810 --> 01:09:31,810
uh,
these experiments called distant 

1216
01:09:31,810 --> 01:09:33,190
experiments have been done viewing 
remote viewing.

1217
01:09:33,230 --> 01:09:36,950
It now done so accurately analyze by 
computers.

1218
01:09:37,190 --> 01:09:40,460
You were looking at a town square at the
statue.

1219
01:09:41,570 --> 01:09:46,570
Your coordinated person coordinated by 
the international export export and 

1220
01:09:46,570 --> 01:09:49,550
metric is sitting in the closet in the 
laboratory.

1221
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:55,310
He's just drawing a picture of the 
structure that you're looking at it.

1222
01:09:55,370 --> 01:10:00,370
Nobody knows what you're looking at.
A computer has chosen who it will go to 

1223
01:10:00,370 --> 01:10:04,721
look at the statute at computer,
unbeknownst to everyone connected with 

1224
01:10:04,721 --> 01:10:09,660
the experiment is analyzing the picture 
that with your coordinator friend,

1225
01:10:10,250 --> 01:10:15,080
psychic is drawing of what you're 
looking at and then computer is bringing

1226
01:10:15,081 --> 01:10:18,260
the two together,
the picture of the statute that they are

1227
01:10:18,261 --> 01:10:21,460
actually looking at and the picture that
the person has drawn.

1228
01:10:21,500 --> 01:10:24,290
Computer does the matching and computer 
says,

1229
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:27,560
Hey,
there is 90 percent match between this.

1230
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:31,040
This could not be just a happenstance,
this,

1231
01:10:31,150 --> 01:10:34,100
this got to be a transfer of 
information.

1232
01:10:34,101 --> 01:10:36,610
Got To be an example of telepathically.

1233
01:10:36,660 --> 01:10:41,660
What is some studies specifically have 
shown remote viewing tie to be that 

1234
01:10:41,691 --> 01:10:46,691
accurate?
Is there anything that you could just 

1235
01:10:46,691 --> 01:10:46,691
for the folks listening?

1236
01:10:46,691 --> 01:10:49,750
Yeah.
That day said Russell targeted Harold 

1237
01:10:49,750 --> 01:10:50,180
put off,
started this kind of experiment.

1238
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:52,700
Uh,
in 19 seventies.

1239
01:10:53,090 --> 01:10:58,090
Yeah.
Russell Targ is actually coming on the 

1240
01:10:58,090 --> 01:10:58,090
podcast.
He's,

1241
01:10:58,090 --> 01:11:00,290
he's going to be on in April.

1242
01:11:00,420 --> 01:11:01,040
Yeah.
I put,

1243
01:11:01,440 --> 01:11:03,390
yeah,
he was one of the pioneers.

1244
01:11:03,570 --> 01:11:07,380
So distracted this and 19 slash 70,
a 73,

1245
01:11:07,381 --> 01:11:12,381
74 if I remember it right.
And he and her all put off his partner.

1246
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:16,410
They did a lot of this in Sri Stanford 
Research Institute.

1247
01:11:16,980 --> 01:11:21,980
And um,
what the new thing is that these are,

1248
01:11:22,380 --> 01:11:25,710
the analysis is done much by very 
objectively.

1249
01:11:26,160 --> 01:11:31,160
It's no longer subject,
but even then materialist object to it 

1250
01:11:31,160 --> 01:11:32,610
because it's,
it's still the mind,

1251
01:11:33,690 --> 01:11:38,690
but in the experiment that I gave you,
transport potential experiment of our 

1252
01:11:38,690 --> 01:11:40,980
Greenberg,
nobody can object because it is not.

1253
01:11:41,010 --> 01:11:46,010
Mine is not involve.
Actually cognitive cognition got 

1254
01:11:46,010 --> 01:11:46,020
involved.
People immediately start saying,

1255
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:47,340
well,
it's subjective,

1256
01:11:47,850 --> 01:11:50,940
but here they transfer.
That actually isn't the objective domain

1257
01:11:51,130 --> 01:11:56,130
material.
Measurable Material in measurable 

1258
01:11:56,130 --> 01:12:00,021
electric potential here in material,
in measurable electric potential there 

1259
01:12:00,210 --> 01:12:05,210
in between.
No local connection and therefore the 

1260
01:12:05,210 --> 01:12:05,870
proof.
Actually in this experiment,

1261
01:12:05,880 --> 01:12:10,880
the transport potential experiment is 
the most accurate proof of nonlocality 

1262
01:12:10,980 --> 01:12:11,790
than you ever saw.

1263
01:12:12,570 --> 01:12:17,570
So that means that there's a connection 
that we don't know about that has always

1264
01:12:18,871 --> 01:12:23,871
existed between human beings constantly.
And the only thing that's missing is the

1265
01:12:24,841 --> 01:12:28,110
intention and the focus on the two

1266
01:12:28,370 --> 01:12:31,430
right now it's stated it complete.
Accurate

1267
01:12:31,620 --> 01:12:33,280
is.
I'm sorry.

1268
01:12:33,290 --> 01:12:38,290
Is this something that you think as we 
have evolved from lower primates to 

1269
01:12:38,290 --> 01:12:43,121
human beings,
is this something that is beginning to 

1270
01:12:43,121 --> 01:12:46,481
show its potential in the human species 
is something that might improve and 

1271
01:12:46,481 --> 01:12:46,481
expand

1272
01:12:47,430 --> 01:12:52,430
if you'll believe other experimental 
data that people have been collecting 

1273
01:12:53,621 --> 01:12:56,860
since the early fifties or sixties.
Like,

1274
01:12:56,880 --> 01:13:00,130
um,
the name of that fellow Baxter,

1275
01:13:00,190 --> 01:13:02,200
I forget his first name.
Clyde Baxter.

1276
01:13:02,730 --> 01:13:04,330
That makes them make.
Make A.

1277
01:13:04,420 --> 01:13:06,540
I can look it up for you.
Clyde Baxter,

1278
01:13:06,541 --> 01:13:08,740
Baxter Baxter's,
the last name that I know.

1279
01:13:08,950 --> 01:13:11,820
He did some experiments with 
communication with plants,

1280
01:13:13,480 --> 01:13:17,350
communication with plants.
So no,

1281
01:13:17,351 --> 01:13:18,370
that was,
that was,

1282
01:13:18,460 --> 01:13:21,700
that was one of the earliest experiments
and there are others.

1283
01:13:21,730 --> 01:13:25,390
So it's not just humans.
Plants have that ability.

1284
01:13:25,810 --> 01:13:30,810
Probably even Amoeba has that ability,
but at a very rudimentary.

1285
01:13:31,570 --> 01:13:32,400
Yeah.
His name was Claude.

1286
01:13:32,460 --> 01:13:34,140
It's cleaved c l e

1287
01:13:34,590 --> 01:13:36,140
Baxter,
Baxter.

1288
01:13:36,160 --> 01:13:38,070
Okay.
Lax for hell kind of name is that,

1289
01:13:39,780 --> 01:13:42,390
but great experiment.
You discarded that much,

1290
01:13:42,750 --> 01:13:45,720
but now we understand that.
No,

1291
01:13:45,780 --> 01:13:48,600
because I could really be something in 
his experiments.

1292
01:13:48,860 --> 01:13:53,860
Yeah.
That is absolutely fascinating that 

1293
01:13:53,860 --> 01:13:56,411
there's a perception between animals and
he did it using a polygraph machine.

1294
01:13:56,700 --> 01:13:57,450
Yeah.
Here's your.

1295
01:13:57,451 --> 01:14:00,540
He was polygraphed is shit by Rupert.
Sheldrake is the latest.

1296
01:14:00,720 --> 01:14:05,720
One of the latest trends in this.
He is showing that dogs communicate 

1297
01:14:05,720 --> 01:14:06,630
telepathically with their masters.

1298
01:14:07,220 --> 01:14:12,220
Yeah.
I heard about this and I've also heard 

1299
01:14:12,220 --> 01:14:12,880
some other things.
Rupert sheldrake has said recently,

1300
01:14:12,881 --> 01:14:14,890
something about the speed of light 
varying,

1301
01:14:15,250 --> 01:14:18,430
which a lot of people are coming down on
him for that.

1302
01:14:18,431 --> 01:14:21,760
It's a bad science and pseudoscience at 
best.

1303
01:14:21,950 --> 01:14:23,140
I have that.
Yeah.

1304
01:14:23,141 --> 01:14:25,360
I haven't seen that either,
but there are people in my message where

1305
01:14:25,370 --> 01:14:30,370
we're going bananas about him because 
he's a very controversial character in 

1306
01:14:30,370 --> 01:14:32,230
the first place because if,
if what he says is true,

1307
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:35,230
like the amazing randy is always 
offered,

1308
01:14:35,350 --> 01:14:40,350
I think it's a million dollars for 
anybody can prove any sort of psychic 

1309
01:14:40,350 --> 01:14:43,801
connection.
Why hasn't anybody taking that guy up 

1310
01:14:43,801 --> 01:14:43,801
on.
Because he doesn't pay.

1311
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:48,040
He doesn't pay and pitch because he 
always finds like,

1312
01:14:48,041 --> 01:14:49,690
you know,
it can always object.

1313
01:14:49,700 --> 01:14:52,640
Notice the 70 percent times,
but I 100 percent.

1314
01:14:53,370 --> 01:14:55,600
Is that what he does?
I don't know what he does,

1315
01:14:55,601 --> 01:14:59,200
but he will not pay anybody looked at 
this kind of situation.

1316
01:14:59,680 --> 01:15:03,610
You can always raised some objection to 
everything.

1317
01:15:04,040 --> 01:15:09,040
Has there ever been a study that you've 
seen on these dogs knowing that their 

1318
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:09,800
masters are coming on this trip

1319
01:15:10,230 --> 01:15:15,230
movie after movie is made a movie of 
this and I saw the movie.

1320
01:15:15,241 --> 01:15:17,540
It has to marketplace.
I know him.

1321
01:15:17,541 --> 01:15:22,541
I'm a good friend of his actually.
So my wife and I went to his house and 

1322
01:15:22,541 --> 01:15:27,201
he showed us a movie of the dog and also
the parrot parrots.

1323
01:15:28,340 --> 01:15:31,650
He has shown also can communicate 
telepathically with their master's.

1324
01:15:31,740 --> 01:15:34,590
Oh,
it's amazing it dog movie.

1325
01:15:34,591 --> 01:15:39,090
I remember very clearly.
The dog is waiting in the house.

1326
01:15:39,830 --> 01:15:42,600
He and his regular sitting place is the 
software.

1327
01:15:42,900 --> 01:15:45,480
That's why as soon as the master lives,
he loves her.

1328
01:15:45,670 --> 01:15:48,620
He jumps on the Sofa and invest there.
You know it.

1329
01:15:49,020 --> 01:15:52,890
They love human warmth,
warming up the sofa,

1330
01:15:52,990 --> 01:15:55,020
the particular place where to master 
satin.

1331
01:15:55,420 --> 01:15:59,160
They'll stay there,
so is there and 5:00

1332
01:15:59,161 --> 01:16:04,161
comes right.
Master is now getting up from her desk 

1333
01:16:06,930 --> 01:16:09,540
and the dog jumps and comes through the 
window.

1334
01:16:11,940 --> 01:16:16,940
It's time and time again.
He has photograph the dog and 

1335
01:16:16,940 --> 01:16:20,811
photographs in muster,
so dogs are becoming aware as soon as 

1336
01:16:20,811 --> 01:16:24,951
the master is ready to come home and 
that awareness is shown by the dog 

1337
01:16:25,261 --> 01:16:30,180
jumping down at that exact time,
as master gets up from her desk,

1338
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:33,660
his guest to come home,
it's amazing.

1339
01:16:33,661 --> 01:16:36,360
He's done it multiple times,
multiple times of it,

1340
01:16:37,150 --> 01:16:42,150
and always using cameras in both places 
in synchrony and always exactly at that 

1341
01:16:43,591 --> 01:16:48,591
time.
The dog will react and if they've 

1342
01:16:48,591 --> 01:16:52,550
mastered,
does not get up from the desk dog will 

1343
01:16:52,550 --> 01:16:55,461
not get up from his sofa either.
So it takes quite amazing responses.

1344
01:16:56,670 --> 01:16:57,480
So what I said,

1345
01:16:57,710 --> 01:17:00,960
why doesn't just collect that million?
No,

1346
01:17:01,020 --> 01:17:03,530
I would say I feel like that's,
you know,

1347
01:17:03,560 --> 01:17:07,910
if you got that concept is called 
morphic resonance,

1348
01:17:07,911 --> 01:17:09,660
is that not,
this is,

1349
01:17:10,340 --> 01:17:15,340
he will not bring morphic resonance for 
discipline metrics.

1350
01:17:15,960 --> 01:17:19,540
Part of transforming people's learning.
That's a,

1351
01:17:19,590 --> 01:17:21,590
that's a slightly different thing.
You learned something.

1352
01:17:21,591 --> 01:17:23,930
It's stored in the morphic morphic 
fields,

1353
01:17:23,990 --> 01:17:27,430
morphogenetic fields.
And then um,

1354
01:17:27,590 --> 01:17:32,590
if I,
I might be able to get this 

1355
01:17:32,590 --> 01:17:33,000
morphogenetic fields to communicate to.

1356
01:17:33,160 --> 01:17:33,570
Yeah.
I,

1357
01:17:33,620 --> 01:17:34,250
the,
the,

1358
01:17:34,320 --> 01:17:39,320
the,
the concept I thought was kind of 

1359
01:17:39,320 --> 01:17:39,320
related because his uh,
his,

1360
01:17:39,320 --> 01:17:42,460
he deals in an interconnectivity sort of
a way to with this.

1361
01:17:42,540 --> 01:17:47,540
Well,
he believes that if animals have 

1362
01:17:47,540 --> 01:17:49,980
animals,
like every species have a certain sort 

1363
01:17:49,980 --> 01:17:52,450
of a database almost.
And then if rats in St Paul learn how to

1364
01:17:52,451 --> 01:17:54,550
get through a maze,
the same rats in Florida,

1365
01:17:54,551 --> 01:17:55,810
we'll be able to get through a quicker.

1366
01:17:55,980 --> 01:18:00,980
Yeah.
But this kind of thing has to be taken 

1367
01:18:00,980 --> 01:18:00,980
with a grain of salt.
That does.

1368
01:18:00,980 --> 01:18:05,440
Yeah.
And all the crazy shit we've talked 

1369
01:18:05,440 --> 01:18:05,440
about that has to be taken with a grain 
of salt.

1370
01:18:05,440 --> 01:18:08,980
Yeah.
Because the transfer is occurring to 

1371
01:18:08,980 --> 01:18:08,980
this,
this,

1372
01:18:08,980 --> 01:18:09,210
this,
this,

1373
01:18:09,330 --> 01:18:11,640
this pills.
The morphogenetic field.

1374
01:18:12,290 --> 01:18:12,870
It,
it,

1375
01:18:12,960 --> 01:18:17,960
it,
it may not transfer in exactly that form

1376
01:18:19,110 --> 01:18:20,850
is what I'm.
What I'm saying is that the.

1377
01:18:20,851 --> 01:18:25,230
Originally what happened was people 
started this kind of thinking because an

1378
01:18:25,231 --> 01:18:28,070
experiments seem to have done this 
experiment.

1379
01:18:28,500 --> 01:18:31,410
Real experiment was that the,
uh,

1380
01:18:31,500 --> 01:18:33,230
in an island,
uh,

1381
01:18:33,990 --> 01:18:38,990
some monkeys learn a monkey model.
That's how it started.

1382
01:18:39,720 --> 01:18:44,720
And monkey mother learned to wash her 
sweet potato before eating.

1383
01:18:46,440 --> 01:18:48,750
And she found that the test improves 
much.

1384
01:18:49,110 --> 01:18:51,940
So she immediately talked to her 
offspring.

1385
01:18:52,620 --> 01:18:56,460
So the baby monkeys are also learning 
that.

1386
01:18:56,520 --> 01:19:01,520
And then the entire island of monkeys 
learn to sweet potatoes before eating.

1387
01:19:03,720 --> 01:19:07,130
Somehow this was the data untopological 
data.

1388
01:19:07,131 --> 01:19:09,770
I've looked at the paper and the 
original journal,

1389
01:19:11,820 --> 01:19:16,820
but when somehow somebody reported on 
this data in a book that somebody 

1390
01:19:17,281 --> 01:19:21,240
invented an extension which never 
happened,

1391
01:19:21,900 --> 01:19:26,900
which is that in monkeys in a nearby 
island without any connection picked up 

1392
01:19:28,531 --> 01:19:28,910
the same,

1393
01:19:29,400 --> 01:19:32,840
so it's a lie.
It was based on next saturation.

1394
01:19:33,390 --> 01:19:36,840
Very Fun motherfuckers researchers that 
exaggerate.

1395
01:19:36,841 --> 01:19:39,360
That's a dangerous.
That's a dangerous habit.

1396
01:19:39,790 --> 01:19:41,860
Exaggerated.
This is not a restructuring.

1397
01:19:43,310 --> 01:19:45,180
Comedians exaggerated,
but it's funny,

1398
01:19:45,380 --> 01:19:50,380
Dan,
unfortunately communicators exaggerate 

1399
01:19:50,460 --> 01:19:51,720
communicators,
etc.

1400
01:19:51,780 --> 01:19:54,480
Because we are used to attract 
attention.

1401
01:19:54,481 --> 01:19:56,490
Yes.
Anything for the sake of attention,

1402
01:19:56,520 --> 01:19:59,730
so mayBe they just wanted to get funding
for their research.

1403
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,130
Not that way.
No researcher exaggerated.

1404
01:20:02,131 --> 01:20:05,670
It's the only the communicators,
they thing that the book will sell more.

1405
01:20:05,671 --> 01:20:07,980
If I say something I understand.
I would

1406
01:20:07,980 --> 01:20:12,980
assume that something like animals 
washing their food if human beings.

1407
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:19,400
I mean the word evolution is a very 
touchy subject amongst people when it 

1408
01:20:19,400 --> 01:20:21,330
comes to natural selection and the 
advancement of the species,

1409
01:20:21,331 --> 01:20:26,331
but it's commonly knowledged 
scientifically that we were once 

1410
01:20:26,331 --> 01:20:28,830
primitive organisms and that's all that 
was on the planet.

1411
01:20:29,490 --> 01:20:33,840
If that is the case,
the intelligent animals like chimpanzees

1412
01:20:33,841 --> 01:20:35,870
or monkeYs or whatever,
they would,

1413
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:41,000
I would assume that much like people 
slowly all over the world figured out 

1414
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:45,321
how to make tools with rocks,
that monkeys would slowly figuring out 

1415
01:20:45,321 --> 01:20:45,321
new things.
CAt

1416
01:20:45,321 --> 01:20:45,520
litter.
Yeah.

1417
01:20:45,870 --> 01:20:47,270
They themselves.
no,

1418
01:20:47,350 --> 01:20:50,400
I'm just saying that cats are born just 
knowing how to use the cat litter box.

1419
01:20:50,420 --> 01:20:51,840
It's in there.
Yeah,

1420
01:20:51,970 --> 01:20:54,250
exactly.
That's why they never get smart enough.

1421
01:20:54,260 --> 01:20:56,850
Thank you for pointing that out.
exactly.

1422
01:20:57,200 --> 01:21:00,680
It's interesting because you are right 
and do it right,

1423
01:21:01,450 --> 01:21:04,930
because it is true that lots of things 
don't get transferred.

1424
01:21:04,931 --> 01:21:09,931
So in philly,
and it is also true that there are this 

1425
01:21:09,931 --> 01:21:10,180
a case of instinct,
right?

1426
01:21:10,260 --> 01:21:15,260
There was some transparent stop,
that kind of thing that universally 

1427
01:21:15,260 --> 01:21:18,730
everybody has picked up within.
Then what's your feeling on epigenetics?

1428
01:21:18,760 --> 01:21:22,790
The idea that that epigenetics are 
related to this morphogenic fields,

1429
01:21:22,870 --> 01:21:27,870
so it is not very clear.
Would you explain that to be sure belief

1430
01:21:29,180 --> 01:21:34,180
was ever since darwin and after some 
verifications of darwin that came apart,

1431
01:21:35,210 --> 01:21:40,210
the belief has been that genes are the 
only way that any heriditary 

1432
01:21:40,210 --> 01:21:44,620
characteristics learning can be 
transferred to subsequent generations.

1433
01:21:44,890 --> 01:21:49,890
That has been the belief right now.
Now though,

1434
01:21:51,760 --> 01:21:56,530
there are phenomena which showed that 
no,

1435
01:21:56,531 --> 01:21:58,570
something else move.
Very well be involved.

1436
01:21:59,110 --> 01:22:04,110
One of the striking phenomenon is this 
phenomenon of morphogenesis or cell 

1437
01:22:04,121 --> 01:22:09,121
differentiation.
We all begin as you and I both began as 

1438
01:22:09,180 --> 01:22:11,530
single celled embryos,
right,

1439
01:22:11,890 --> 01:22:15,160
and then that single cell divides itself
divided itself,

1440
01:22:15,190 --> 01:22:20,190
making replica itself,
but it is still true that our toast 

1441
01:22:20,190 --> 01:22:21,880
cells and our brain cells behave very 
differently.

1442
01:22:22,210 --> 01:22:24,850
Why?
Because the proteins are very different.

1443
01:22:24,940 --> 01:22:28,420
Proteins that are made in those cells 
are proteins.

1444
01:22:29,200 --> 01:22:34,200
Proteins are made because of 
instructions written in the gene called 

1445
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:37,621
the genetic code,
but the genes ababa all of ourselves at 

1446
01:22:37,621 --> 01:22:41,221
the same.
So the expansion is that some genes are 

1447
01:22:41,221 --> 01:22:44,521
activated in the tau proteins and other 
genes are activated in the brain making 

1448
01:22:46,301 --> 01:22:51,190
the brain proteins.
This is why brain cells differ very much

1449
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:53,800
in their activity than the host cells.

1450
01:22:54,370 --> 01:22:55,150
Okay.
So far?

1451
01:22:55,480 --> 01:22:56,340
Yes.
Alright,

1452
01:22:56,410 --> 01:23:01,410
so then this.
How does the cell different sessions 

1453
01:23:01,410 --> 01:23:04,890
take place?
So people said there must be programs 

1454
01:23:05,150 --> 01:23:10,150
sub ditto sally's program differently 
than the genes of brain cells were sales

1455
01:23:12,960 --> 01:23:17,960
and brand sauce that sand banks have 
different programs running the but where

1456
01:23:18,640 --> 01:23:20,020
are these programs?
Right.

1457
01:23:20,260 --> 01:23:23,740
So initially the ability has the program
must also be in the genes.

1458
01:23:25,090 --> 01:23:29,920
Now people are seeing that no,
the programs for cell different session,

1459
01:23:30,040 --> 01:23:35,040
not in the genes,
they are in the epigenetics outside of 

1460
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:39,060
teaching.
So sheldrick originally was suggesting 

1461
01:23:39,060 --> 01:23:43,360
very something very similar which is 
idea of morphogenetic field.

1462
01:23:44,080 --> 01:23:49,080
And so if you assume that morphogenetic 
fields are they blueprints of biological

1463
01:23:49,241 --> 01:23:53,160
form and they are non local,
then there is no way,

1464
01:23:53,510 --> 01:23:58,510
no difficulty in explaining why they tow
cells behave very differently in brain 

1465
01:23:58,510 --> 01:24:03,181
cell.
How does the cell know what to do in a 

1466
01:24:03,181 --> 01:24:03,580
different way when it is in the 
different parts of the body?

1467
01:24:03,580 --> 01:24:08,580
If it's in the in the toe,
then those genes to be activated which 

1468
01:24:10,001 --> 01:24:12,490
can,
which can make protein which can perform

1469
01:24:12,491 --> 01:24:17,491
in the way if it's in the brain.
Similarly those genes will be activated 

1470
01:24:18,011 --> 01:24:21,110
which can make protein which makes it 
behave to brain way,

1471
01:24:21,580 --> 01:24:26,580
but how are they doing it in all in 
synchrony because of this nonlocal 

1472
01:24:26,580 --> 01:24:31,080
morphogenetic field that is involved,
so in a way epigenetics is the first 

1473
01:24:31,241 --> 01:24:33,940
step of verification of shelter.
Next idea.

1474
01:24:34,390 --> 01:24:39,390
The next step is taken by a biologist 
like bruce lipton who are saying that 

1475
01:24:39,881 --> 01:24:41,020
well,
quantum practice,

1476
01:24:41,021 --> 01:24:46,021
certain balled in biology and safe 
quantum processes involved in our 

1477
01:24:46,090 --> 01:24:51,090
consciousness based quantum measurement 
theory is telling us that consciousness 

1478
01:24:51,090 --> 01:24:53,020
must be involved in this way.
We can.

1479
01:24:53,050 --> 01:24:57,820
We now can understand the whole gamut of
ideas that leads to these things.

1480
01:24:58,420 --> 01:25:00,910
And finally to connect up what you are 
just saying.

1481
01:25:00,910 --> 01:25:05,710
These instincts,
so certain learning from the past to get

1482
01:25:05,711 --> 01:25:09,340
passed on.
So the belief is tech specific,

1483
01:25:09,700 --> 01:25:14,200
some specific type of learning which 
involves emotions.

1484
01:25:14,230 --> 01:25:19,180
My guess is that if the learning's 
involves emotional,

1485
01:25:19,240 --> 01:25:24,240
has an emotional aspect,
then probably the morphogenetic fields 

1486
01:25:24,251 --> 01:25:29,251
are easier to transfer the certain 
innate involving peers and similar 

1487
01:25:33,251 --> 01:25:36,790
emotions,
egotism and suck even racism,

1488
01:25:37,360 --> 01:25:40,000
racism,
this kind of thing.

1489
01:25:40,030 --> 01:25:45,030
But what if it is purely cerebral mental
than it is probably harder to transfer 

1490
01:25:46,650 --> 01:25:51,650
through morphogenic field.
That morphogenetic field transfer is a 

1491
01:25:52,210 --> 01:25:57,210
pretty fairly good idea and you have to 
find some explanation of the instincts 

1492
01:25:57,210 --> 01:25:58,410
that it did get transferred in 
windstream.

1493
01:25:58,430 --> 01:26:02,380
Start universal.
So we have a very peculiar situation.

1494
01:26:02,381 --> 01:26:05,190
Instincts could not possibly be 
explained by genetics.

1495
01:26:05,220 --> 01:26:07,950
Many people have written about this 
saturday,

1496
01:26:07,951 --> 01:26:10,170
difficult to understand on the basis of 
genes.

1497
01:26:10,440 --> 01:26:13,170
So if you'll bring morphogenetic field 
to understand the instinct,

1498
01:26:13,460 --> 01:26:15,510
then you get the idea that yes,
we can,

1499
01:26:15,511 --> 01:26:20,340
we can today become a nicer person,
have brain circuits of um,

1500
01:26:20,910 --> 01:26:22,290
uh,
love.

1501
01:26:22,590 --> 01:26:27,590
ANd then a few generations later via the
transference morphogenetic field,

1502
01:26:27,990 --> 01:26:31,340
everybody will begin to have circuits of
loving their pain.

1503
01:26:31,750 --> 01:26:36,750
Well,
you bring up a really interesting point 

1504
01:26:36,750 --> 01:26:36,750
because,
um,

1505
01:26:36,750 --> 01:26:39,420
the,
the chemical composition of a,

1506
01:26:39,690 --> 01:26:43,720
of the mind,
all the different serotonin and dopamine

1507
01:26:43,721 --> 01:26:48,721
and neurotransmitters and all the 
different things that are going on 

1508
01:26:48,721 --> 01:26:51,180
inside the mind,
it will alter those and one way or 

1509
01:26:51,180 --> 01:26:54,661
another,
positive or negative and you get 

1510
01:26:54,661 --> 01:26:56,431
profound effects on how the person 
behaves and thinks and interfaces with 

1511
01:26:56,431 --> 01:27:00,511
their reality.
How do you feel persoNally about the all

1512
01:27:00,661 --> 01:27:03,580
the different pills that people are on 
and all the different pills that,

1513
01:27:03,640 --> 01:27:08,320
that alter consciousness.
It seems a very strange time when we are

1514
01:27:08,321 --> 01:27:12,830
doing so much experimentation on a,
on a daily basis,

1515
01:27:12,880 --> 01:27:17,880
altering the way a person's mind is a,
is interfacing with its reality and 

1516
01:27:18,191 --> 01:27:21,640
we're see profound effects.
a lot of people don't know.

1517
01:27:21,641 --> 01:27:26,410
NInety percent of school shooters either
were on antidepressants,

1518
01:27:26,950 --> 01:27:29,170
had been on them and we're on 
withdrawal.

1519
01:27:30,010 --> 01:27:31,780
Ninety percent is a big number.
I mean,

1520
01:27:31,781 --> 01:27:36,781
it doesn't prove that that's what caused
it because a lot of times these people 

1521
01:27:36,781 --> 01:27:38,380
are depressed and guess what?
People were depressed.

1522
01:27:38,381 --> 01:27:43,381
Getting on antidepressants.
It doesn't mean that it caused them to 

1523
01:27:43,381 --> 01:27:43,381
be psychotic or to have psychotic 
breaks,

1524
01:27:43,381 --> 01:27:45,780
but there is something to be,
there's,

1525
01:27:45,840 --> 01:27:50,840
there's,
there's something to be studied for 

1526
01:27:50,840 --> 01:27:50,840
sure.

1527
01:27:50,840 --> 01:27:53,240
Well,
it's very dangerous to put the natural 

1528
01:27:53,240 --> 01:27:56,930
brain under tracks of any kind,
especially those drugs which are 

1529
01:27:56,930 --> 01:28:00,780
psychoactive because you don't ever know
strategies there.

1530
01:28:00,781 --> 01:28:02,420
So scanty,
uh,

1531
01:28:02,550 --> 01:28:07,550
you don't even know what the effects are
and how the effects will be specialty 

1532
01:28:07,550 --> 01:28:08,740
longterm effects.
And,

1533
01:28:08,741 --> 01:28:13,741
and,
and what we do know is that depression 

1534
01:28:13,741 --> 01:28:15,930
is now the third biggest epidemic 
disease.

1535
01:28:16,360 --> 01:28:19,740
It's almost epidemic,
but besides heart disease and cancer,

1536
01:28:20,360 --> 01:28:24,930
depression is the third most common 
chronic disease who I.

1537
01:28:24,931 --> 01:28:29,931
Is it because depression depends so much
on these brain chemicals and of course 

1538
01:28:30,211 --> 01:28:33,060
so much also on how we process our 
stuff,

1539
01:28:33,180 --> 01:28:38,180
emotions thinking.
So something is basically going wrong in

1540
01:28:38,791 --> 01:28:39,410
the,
in the,

1541
01:28:39,440 --> 01:28:41,190
in the new theory,
um,

1542
01:28:41,280 --> 01:28:46,280
wherever we talk in terms of chakras,
because all the places where they're 

1543
01:28:46,280 --> 01:28:51,080
very much involved with our emotions,
the emotion that is involved in the 

1544
01:28:51,080 --> 01:28:53,670
highest place in our body,
the neocortex,

1545
01:28:54,120 --> 01:28:57,660
emotions that are involved with 
specifically our,

1546
01:28:57,690 --> 01:28:59,100
what we call satisfaction.

1547
01:28:59,790 --> 01:29:04,790
So If neocortex dIsplayed with certainly
it will affect our level of 

1548
01:29:06,481 --> 01:29:09,900
satisfaction.
By the same token,

1549
01:29:10,080 --> 01:29:15,080
people might be using antIdepressant to 
better suit your level of satisfaction.

1550
01:29:15,451 --> 01:29:17,310
You know what happens when you take 
prozac,

1551
01:29:17,940 --> 01:29:20,190
you get sort of,
you get temporarily,

1552
01:29:20,250 --> 01:29:23,910
it will get to get,
get to look at the world as okay,

1553
01:29:24,060 --> 01:29:25,620
you're getting a feeling of,
okay,

1554
01:29:25,970 --> 01:29:30,970
they're satisfied so people are using 
things like that to give them a feeling 

1555
01:29:30,970 --> 01:29:35,541
of satisfaction because it's not there 
in the absence of taking this drug 

1556
01:29:36,360 --> 01:29:38,460
prozac,
so in this way,

1557
01:29:38,640 --> 01:29:43,640
but we don't know the consequence of 
taking prozac and a good brain longterm 

1558
01:29:43,640 --> 01:29:46,770
consequences of it.
I am terribly,

1559
01:29:46,771 --> 01:29:51,771
terribly upset about the drug culture 
because we're getting into stuff.

1560
01:29:54,330 --> 01:29:59,330
Does every device that we need that is 
intimately connected with our 

1561
01:29:59,330 --> 01:30:04,200
consciousness,
our brain that is no manifest 

1562
01:30:04,200 --> 01:30:06,440
consciousness.
We have to recognize that to play with 

1563
01:30:06,440 --> 01:30:09,741
that vehicle,
which gives us the basic way of 

1564
01:30:09,741 --> 01:30:13,551
cognition,
basic way of experiencing everything 

1565
01:30:13,551 --> 01:30:13,551
that we know.

1566
01:30:14,430 --> 01:30:18,150
Conversely though,
I have met people that have some sort of

1567
01:30:18,151 --> 01:30:23,151
an imbalance,
they have some sort of a chemical 

1568
01:30:23,151 --> 01:30:26,601
balance in the mind and I have 
personally seen people take medication 

1569
01:30:26,601 --> 01:30:28,050
and it's benefited them,
greatly improved,

1570
01:30:28,890 --> 01:30:33,890
but there's that,
but then there's also people that just.

1571
01:30:34,111 --> 01:30:36,440
They're not living a fulfilling life 
there.

1572
01:30:36,480 --> 01:30:38,610
They don't have good friendships,
relationships,

1573
01:30:38,640 --> 01:30:43,640
job opportunities that they're not 
pursuing the career they really wanted 

1574
01:30:43,640 --> 01:30:47,721
to impress for good reason to be 
depressed and a lot of times with that 

1575
01:30:47,721 --> 01:30:50,991
depression is is in fact the world 
around you and how your body is 

1576
01:30:51,301 --> 01:30:56,301
perceiving it in the negative energy 
that you're getting and feeling about 

1577
01:30:56,301 --> 01:30:57,480
it.
It's supposed to motivate you to change,

1578
01:30:57,930 --> 01:30:59,970
supposed to motivate you to move away 
from it.

1579
01:30:59,971 --> 01:31:04,971
The negative feelings that you have 
after any personal altercation with 

1580
01:31:04,971 --> 01:31:04,971
someone,
those are supposed to be like,

1581
01:31:04,971 --> 01:31:06,030
that's to let you know,
hey,

1582
01:31:06,210 --> 01:31:08,460
whatever you just did,
don't fucking do that anymore.

1583
01:31:08,580 --> 01:31:09,330
Okay,
whatever.

1584
01:31:09,360 --> 01:31:14,360
However you interacted with the person 
that created this terrible wave of bad 

1585
01:31:14,360 --> 01:31:15,090
feelings,
it's not satisfying.

1586
01:31:15,091 --> 01:31:20,091
It's not satisfying to you and you can't
just take a pill executive to change 

1587
01:31:20,091 --> 01:31:20,091
that,

1588
01:31:20,091 --> 01:31:24,820
but the way to where to where to took 
kinds of situation involved here and the

1589
01:31:25,581 --> 01:31:30,581
brain,
the device itself may have wrong 

1590
01:31:30,581 --> 01:31:30,581
neurochemicals and therefore we get the 
satisfaction.

1591
01:31:30,581 --> 01:31:35,401
We get depression or it can be that the 
psychological effect of stuff that's 

1592
01:31:35,421 --> 01:31:40,421
producing the depression.
If it is the the latter psychological 

1593
01:31:40,421 --> 01:31:45,221
stuff that producing dissatisfaction.
Then actually in a way it's easier 

1594
01:31:45,230 --> 01:31:47,540
because we can use psychological method.
In fact,

1595
01:31:47,541 --> 01:31:52,541
we should.
I am not in favor of using brain 

1596
01:31:52,541 --> 01:31:56,981
chemicals like prozac to reestablish the
balance.

1597
01:31:57,050 --> 01:32:02,050
If the cost is psychological,
if the call is coming from genetics or 

1598
01:32:02,140 --> 01:32:06,940
family history are,
are clear brain dysfunction,

1599
01:32:07,270 --> 01:32:12,270
brain imbalance,
then it should be treated with what 

1600
01:32:12,270 --> 01:32:13,310
brain chemicals with,
with,

1601
01:32:13,550 --> 01:32:17,850
with madison.
But If it is psychologically caused,

1602
01:32:17,890 --> 01:32:22,890
it's better to try to improve the 
satisfaction level of the person and 

1603
01:32:23,231 --> 01:32:27,600
when we can,
we can by bringing in the heart chakras,

1604
01:32:27,601 --> 01:32:30,160
starting with the heart chakra where 
love resides.

1605
01:32:31,360 --> 01:32:34,390
Then expression where,
um,

1606
01:32:34,690 --> 01:32:39,690
which decides and the throat chakra and 
then podcasting which resides in the 

1607
01:32:39,690 --> 01:32:42,250
tardive or in between the two brows,
brow chakra,

1608
01:32:42,610 --> 01:32:46,660
and then of course the crown chakra in 
the neocortex,

1609
01:32:46,661 --> 01:32:51,661
which is the seat of satisfaction so we 
can improve satisfaction by 

1610
01:32:51,661 --> 01:32:54,850
concentrating not so much on the lord 
emotions,

1611
01:32:55,090 --> 01:33:00,090
which is the lower chakras there.
The emotions that you get are all those 

1612
01:33:00,640 --> 01:33:03,900
fear and sexuality and price.

1613
01:33:03,950 --> 01:33:05,110
Sexuality low

1614
01:33:05,560 --> 01:33:07,510
or know,
I thought it was way up there.

1615
01:33:08,040 --> 01:33:12,220
It's in a sense because it's a doorway 
to something where of have to love.

1616
01:33:12,280 --> 01:33:16,810
So sex is actually a very special one 
because if used in moderation,

1617
01:33:17,110 --> 01:33:20,270
sex is actually a very good one because 
it's the doorway to love.

1618
01:33:20,280 --> 01:33:21,210
It's one doorway.

1619
01:33:21,600 --> 01:33:24,750
I've always thought that I always got 
pissed off at monks that don't have sex

1620
01:33:25,770 --> 01:33:30,360
coming sexist.
This is why we call effing make love,

1621
01:33:30,361 --> 01:33:31,410
right?
Watching.

1622
01:33:31,660 --> 01:33:32,580
It can.
You can,

1623
01:33:32,650 --> 01:33:35,550
you can do it the effort or you can do 
it.

1624
01:33:35,551 --> 01:33:37,560
Making law.
The cost point,

1625
01:33:37,561 --> 01:33:40,110
is that what you.
The way we use it,

1626
01:33:40,830 --> 01:33:44,010
so sexist,
kind of good and bad both.

1627
01:33:44,030 --> 01:33:45,830
I mean all of this actually good and 
bad.

1628
01:33:45,831 --> 01:33:49,500
Both fear is also good sometimes because
it takes us away from danger.

1629
01:33:50,130 --> 01:33:55,130
You go test.
The movement is good sometimes because 

1630
01:33:55,130 --> 01:33:55,130
it gives us assurance.
Self assurance,

1631
01:33:55,130 --> 01:33:58,380
so used in moderation and negative 
emotions are okay.

1632
01:33:58,680 --> 01:34:00,630
It's one day.
Go out of control.

1633
01:34:01,620 --> 01:34:06,360
Then there are problems.
Positive emotions are good all the time,

1634
01:34:06,750 --> 01:34:11,490
little or more.
Love is not going to kill you.

1635
01:34:11,700 --> 01:34:15,600
Love is only going to elevate you so you
can never have too much love.

1636
01:34:16,380 --> 01:34:21,380
So in this way,
if we learn to concentrate more on this 

1637
01:34:21,380 --> 01:34:25,310
positive emotions,
we could actually heal or psychological.

1638
01:34:25,320 --> 01:34:28,170
He caused cases of depression

1639
01:34:29,240 --> 01:34:34,240
psychologically caused cases of 
depression and that's where you have to 

1640
01:34:34,240 --> 01:34:34,240
differentiate,
correct.

1641
01:34:34,240 --> 01:34:38,350
You have to differentiate between people
who are depressed because they're in a 

1642
01:34:38,350 --> 01:34:40,610
bad state in life and people who are 
depressed because the mind's not working

1643
01:34:40,611 --> 01:34:43,160
correctly and there are two,
and this is not work.

1644
01:34:43,320 --> 01:34:48,320
The real issue is the overdiagnosis than
or at least the overprescription of 

1645
01:34:48,840 --> 01:34:53,540
prescribing psychologists tend to do 
because it's easy to treat the

1646
01:34:53,990 --> 01:34:58,990
brain chemicals.
The chemical psychologist try to get 

1647
01:35:00,201 --> 01:35:03,530
away with just using drugs because the 
effect will be quicker.

1648
01:35:04,760 --> 01:35:09,050
I think if we use an integration of both
approaches,

1649
01:35:09,230 --> 01:35:14,230
why they do quicker because it's.
Have you ever lived with a mentally ill 

1650
01:35:15,501 --> 01:35:18,710
person is difficult.
It's very difficult,

1651
01:35:18,711 --> 01:35:21,500
so parents,
of course one immediate cure,

1652
01:35:21,880 --> 01:35:26,880
so best strategy probably is to use 
antidepressants immediately because that

1653
01:35:28,641 --> 01:35:33,641
will give a temporary healing,
but of course the psychological 

1654
01:35:33,641 --> 01:35:34,520
residents who will be president so it 
will come back,

1655
01:35:34,580 --> 01:35:39,580
it will continue,
and then they start the psychological 

1656
01:35:39,580 --> 01:35:44,290
treatment that I'm suggesting,
which are already people are suggesting 

1657
01:35:44,290 --> 01:35:45,410
I shouldn't take the original credit for
it,

1658
01:35:45,411 --> 01:35:49,700
nothing like that,
but this dealing with noble emotions,

1659
01:35:49,701 --> 01:35:53,900
how are emotions?
Positive emotions that healing will take

1660
01:35:53,901 --> 01:35:57,100
time.
Prozac can give us time for the prospect

1661
01:35:57,110 --> 01:36:02,110
can buy us time so we can use a 
combination of both conventional and the

1662
01:36:02,510 --> 01:36:06,700
new medicine mind body medicine 
suggestion.

1663
01:36:06,720 --> 01:36:11,720
This is what I suggested is called mind 
body medicine because you're trying to 

1664
01:36:11,720 --> 01:36:13,600
heal the brain in balance with the 
effect of the mind.

1665
01:36:13,790 --> 01:36:14,710
The health.
I'll do mine.

1666
01:36:15,320 --> 01:36:19,100
There seems to be a real issue with 
modern humans too,

1667
01:36:19,101 --> 01:36:24,101
and that the life that we live does not 
really satisfy all of our natural reward

1668
01:36:25,400 --> 01:36:30,400
systems that we have in place.
The hunter gatherer systems and sitting 

1669
01:36:30,400 --> 01:36:32,570
in a cubicle and and you know,
and all of it,

1670
01:36:32,720 --> 01:36:35,960
even monogamy is a struggle for a lot of
people for,

1671
01:36:36,030 --> 01:36:41,030
for that very reason is that we have a 
lot of genetics that are set up from a 

1672
01:36:41,030 --> 01:36:42,800
different time and they're still in our 
system

1673
01:36:42,870 --> 01:36:45,360
and we have not talked to.
We have not taught very well.

1674
01:36:45,361 --> 01:36:47,250
We don't been up and taught how to 
manage it.

1675
01:36:48,100 --> 01:36:50,230
We're not being taught how to manage it 
correctly.

1676
01:36:50,231 --> 01:36:51,330
Yeah.
That's a very important,

1677
01:36:51,360 --> 01:36:51,990
very important.

1678
01:36:52,070 --> 01:36:57,070
Why isn't that one of the most important
things that you could teach a child is 

1679
01:36:57,070 --> 01:36:57,070
how to,
how to manage them

1680
01:36:57,070 --> 01:36:57,070
back to,
uh,

1681
01:36:57,070 --> 01:36:59,790
you know,
educational reform is so needed,

1682
01:36:59,791 --> 01:37:02,550
so needed part.
Another thing,

1683
01:37:02,600 --> 01:37:03,500
you know,
how do you,

1684
01:37:03,570 --> 01:37:07,860
how do you bring this stuff to a child?
You have to use creativity,

1685
01:37:07,920 --> 01:37:12,920
obviously conditioning that.
Their body is conditioned in a certain 

1686
01:37:12,920 --> 01:37:15,990
way since the days of hunter gatherers.
Those conditioning are still present.

1687
01:37:16,320 --> 01:37:21,320
Mine has moved onto restaurant wind.
Look at the predicament of us learning 

1688
01:37:21,320 --> 01:37:24,900
today because some of our conditioning 
of the body,

1689
01:37:24,990 --> 01:37:27,960
the remains the same as the hunter got 
that or nothing has changed,

1690
01:37:28,410 --> 01:37:31,950
but the mind has moved onto purely 
dealing with mine.

1691
01:37:31,951 --> 01:37:33,760
Mine does not even deal with the body.

1692
01:37:34,230 --> 01:37:34,950
Well,
not only that,

1693
01:37:34,951 --> 01:37:39,951
the environment has changed radically to
the environment that your physical 

1694
01:37:39,951 --> 01:37:43,251
body's interfacing with has changed 
radically and those natural reward 

1695
01:37:43,251 --> 01:37:43,620
systems are not being fun,

1696
01:37:43,700 --> 01:37:48,700
not being fed.
So we live in a world where we really 

1697
01:37:48,700 --> 01:37:52,480
need a new educational system which will
bring this aspect stop and use creative 

1698
01:37:53,690 --> 01:37:57,960
creativity quite because these things 
require creative learning.

1699
01:37:57,980 --> 01:38:01,020
What what has to happen is that the 
context of our thinking,

1700
01:38:01,320 --> 01:38:06,320
which is thinking without the emotions,
this has evolved so much.

1701
01:38:06,680 --> 01:38:08,430
you know,
it becomes very cerebral,

1702
01:38:08,460 --> 01:38:11,220
tinkers,
only involvement with neocortex.

1703
01:38:11,580 --> 01:38:16,580
Instead we can.
We can start involving some of what we 

1704
01:38:16,580 --> 01:38:18,150
left behind,
some of the emotions that are intuitive.

1705
01:38:18,270 --> 01:38:23,270
Some of the emotions that you have not 
dealt with and we have to read it 

1706
01:38:24,031 --> 01:38:29,031
tonight.
It integrate how we think about 

1707
01:38:29,031 --> 01:38:33,620
emotions,
reintegrate that into our present life 

1708
01:38:33,620 --> 01:38:35,580
system,
which is more thinking rationally,

1709
01:38:35,581 --> 01:38:39,080
who just thinking about thinking itself,
not so much thinking emotional.

1710
01:38:39,310 --> 01:38:44,310
It's very frustrating to you as as a,
as a professor for over 32 years,

1711
01:38:44,681 --> 01:38:45,400
I believe.
Right?

1712
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:46,990
Is it frustrating to you?

1713
01:38:47,860 --> 01:38:51,460
It was until I discovered new ways of 
teaching.

1714
01:38:52,150 --> 01:38:57,150
I started putting things in an emotional
way because it will get.

1715
01:38:57,640 --> 01:39:00,520
you can reframe it.
You don't have to.

1716
01:39:01,390 --> 01:39:03,190
when we teach new physics,
for example,

1717
01:39:03,191 --> 01:39:05,080
quantum physics versus classical 
physics,

1718
01:39:05,140 --> 01:39:08,320
classical physics is all study abroad,
but quantum physics,

1719
01:39:08,321 --> 01:39:11,470
because it has that aspect of choice I 
choose.

1720
01:39:11,800 --> 01:39:16,800
Therefore something can happen already 
and emotional component can get in 

1721
01:39:16,800 --> 01:39:21,310
because whenever you say I chose,
you'll find that you're a start chapter,

1722
01:39:21,311 --> 01:39:25,570
naval chapter sort of body eagle is 
immediately alert.

1723
01:39:26,300 --> 01:39:30,500
Those were your ego's a body ego,
not reminding the body.

1724
01:39:30,530 --> 01:39:33,020
so that's why people are weirded out 
when you poked her belly button.

1725
01:39:33,920 --> 01:39:36,150
Okay man,
get off my ego.

1726
01:39:37,940 --> 01:39:39,330
There's a bit of that,
uh,

1727
01:39:39,410 --> 01:39:40,130
the,
the,

1728
01:39:40,160 --> 01:39:45,160
when,
when you feel quite as quite assured of 

1729
01:39:45,160 --> 01:39:45,160
yourself,
uh,

1730
01:39:45,160 --> 01:39:47,320
do you find that navel chakra is find a 
quieter teeth?

1731
01:39:47,520 --> 01:39:47,800
But yeah,

1732
01:39:48,750 --> 01:39:52,730
nice enabled massage cooler,
but why do,

1733
01:39:52,731 --> 01:39:55,330
are not feeling?
So I shared butterflies in the stomach.

1734
01:39:55,410 --> 01:39:57,010
Oh,
that's interesting.

1735
01:39:57,040 --> 01:39:59,290
Very common experience.
That's interesting.

1736
01:39:59,291 --> 01:40:04,291
And that's the connection where,
where's the whole soccer thing come 

1737
01:40:04,291 --> 01:40:04,291
from?
What is that from?

1738
01:40:04,291 --> 01:40:04,940
They,
they did.

1739
01:40:05,060 --> 01:40:06,800
There was no explanation for a long 
time.

1740
01:40:07,040 --> 01:40:09,950
Then when the new science,
they have an expedition because then the

1741
01:40:09,951 --> 01:40:13,460
new science to introduce this 
morphogenetic fields as part of reality.

1742
01:40:13,940 --> 01:40:18,940
What are morphogenic fields?
they are the blueprints of biological 

1743
01:40:18,940 --> 01:40:18,940
origins,
right?

1744
01:40:18,940 --> 01:40:23,720
We went to the sell different fashion.
And so neocortex has a blueprInt,

1745
01:40:24,410 --> 01:40:28,480
the toes of a different blueprint.
So there's blueprints is the,

1746
01:40:29,520 --> 01:40:34,520
is the morphogenetic field.
So in quantum physics we started that 

1747
01:40:34,520 --> 01:40:38,350
morphogenetic fields and they organs 
that then non-locally correlated through

1748
01:40:38,360 --> 01:40:42,230
consciousness.
Consciousness operates on one hand,

1749
01:40:42,231 --> 01:40:43,850
the blueprints.
On the other hand,

1750
01:40:43,851 --> 01:40:48,400
the oregon's chakras are those places 
where the organs are present,

1751
01:40:48,420 --> 01:40:51,260
the important part of the body.
look at all the chakras.

1752
01:40:51,350 --> 01:40:54,640
Every chapter is the site of a very 
important organ.

1753
01:40:55,370 --> 01:40:57,350
Is there a sexual bro?
Yo,

1754
01:40:57,650 --> 01:40:58,910
that's.
What's that one called?

1755
01:40:59,430 --> 01:41:02,420
Would that foreign is called sex chakra.
It's called sex chakra.

1756
01:41:02,710 --> 01:41:03,290
Thanks.
Check.

1757
01:41:03,291 --> 01:41:06,410
Did they work on that one in yoga too?
Is that whether the girl is one of those

1758
01:41:06,411 --> 01:41:08,800
tight pants.
So that's all about the course.

1759
01:41:08,810 --> 01:41:11,080
But you have golf course has a sanskrit 
name of it,

1760
01:41:11,240 --> 01:41:14,240
the sanskrit name of it,
but it's pretty complex.

1761
01:41:14,270 --> 01:41:19,270
But there is a scientific sort of a 
correlation between the shock between 

1762
01:41:19,270 --> 01:41:21,470
the sex organs and the corresponding 
morphogenetic field.

1763
01:41:21,500 --> 01:41:23,310
Do you practice yoga yourself?
Yeah,

1764
01:41:23,680 --> 01:41:24,320
every day.

1765
01:41:24,440 --> 01:41:29,440
It's a good thing.
Not every day because of my travel 

1766
01:41:29,440 --> 01:41:29,440
schedule,
but most days that I can.

1767
01:41:29,440 --> 01:41:29,840
Yes.

1768
01:41:30,140 --> 01:41:35,140
And how yoga has been around for 
thousands of years and some people will 

1769
01:41:35,140 --> 01:41:38,531
just dismiss it as simply stretching,
but if you've never actually done it and

1770
01:41:38,991 --> 01:41:43,991
I try to tell people,
just go to one of those beat yoga 

1771
01:41:43,991 --> 01:41:46,961
classes.
Just take one class or or whatever's in 

1772
01:41:46,961 --> 01:41:46,961
your neighborhood.
Just take one class and then talk.

1773
01:41:46,961 --> 01:41:51,790
Because until you do,
you really don't know what that feeling 

1774
01:41:51,790 --> 01:41:52,640
is like.
That feeling after yoga is your high,

1775
01:41:53,440 --> 01:41:55,370
your high a little bit.
You love people.

1776
01:41:55,371 --> 01:41:58,220
You want to call people and apologize.
You want to hug people.

1777
01:41:58,221 --> 01:41:59,450
I'm telling you,
brian,

1778
01:41:59,451 --> 01:42:00,670
you need that shit in your life,
son.

1779
01:42:01,270 --> 01:42:03,630
We were definitely high.

1780
01:42:03,760 --> 01:42:07,000
What happened?
Is that the best with of the ama

1781
01:42:07,220 --> 01:42:08,040
[inaudible] really nice.

1782
01:42:08,340 --> 01:42:13,340
Yes.
The energy gets into the crown chakra 

1783
01:42:13,340 --> 01:42:13,900
satisfaction,
right?

1784
01:42:14,310 --> 01:42:16,770
Or in the higher chakras.
Very definitely.

1785
01:42:17,280 --> 01:42:19,210
so ground chapter is connected with,
you know,

1786
01:42:19,330 --> 01:42:24,330
chronic chapter satisfied.
You get this endorphin molecules that 

1787
01:42:24,330 --> 01:42:25,440
the byproduct of yoga,
the crown chakra.

1788
01:42:25,770 --> 01:42:30,770
So no endorphin molecules are wonderful 
if that's the height,

1789
01:42:30,860 --> 01:42:34,560
that's the high actually.
So it's fairly simple explanation why we

1790
01:42:34,561 --> 01:42:38,450
get decided and why it should not be 
trivialized you.

1791
01:42:38,500 --> 01:42:43,500
There are many other ways to get high,
but this is one of the best ways because

1792
01:42:43,800 --> 01:42:48,800
at the same time your gating,
getting an exercise of the muscles and 

1793
01:42:48,800 --> 01:42:48,800
joints.

1794
01:42:48,800 --> 01:42:52,850
Yes.
And you're stretching and stretching 

1795
01:42:52,850 --> 01:42:52,850
like a lot of people don't think of you 
think of stretching.

1796
01:42:52,850 --> 01:42:57,781
It's for athletic performance,
but stretching is also for attention 

1797
01:42:57,781 --> 01:42:57,940
release.
It's an amazing tension remains.

1798
01:42:57,950 --> 01:42:58,050
Yeah,

1799
01:42:58,160 --> 01:43:03,160
and because that tension release now 
will in the future say you from 

1800
01:43:04,840 --> 01:43:06,780
february.
Debilitating disease.

1801
01:43:07,830 --> 01:43:09,030
Yes,
absolutely.

1802
01:43:09,110 --> 01:43:14,110
So good.
PreventIve medicine in a way and 

1803
01:43:14,110 --> 01:43:15,100
flexibility last is very difficult to 
repair,

1804
01:43:15,110 --> 01:43:20,110
a difficult to.
It's not that hard to maintain once 

1805
01:43:20,110 --> 01:43:20,110
you've attained

1806
01:43:20,110 --> 01:43:24,330
once you have attended and the key is 
not to never to completely discontinue 

1807
01:43:24,330 --> 01:43:26,380
it.
Even if you can do once a week is better

1808
01:43:26,381 --> 01:43:27,490
than not doing it at all.

1809
01:43:27,550 --> 01:43:29,080
You know what the problem with yogurt 
though?

1810
01:43:29,980 --> 01:43:32,910
Fake yoga people.
You know what I'm talking about.

1811
01:43:33,150 --> 01:43:38,150
You do people that are claiming to be 
spiritual and showing up a yoga classes,

1812
01:43:39,791 --> 01:43:42,550
but the really annoying.
Do you know those people?

1813
01:43:42,551 --> 01:43:43,120
You do.
Right,

1814
01:43:43,210 --> 01:43:48,210
but,
but the point is of course that you 

1815
01:43:48,210 --> 01:43:48,210
know,
there will always be effect pupil.

1816
01:43:48,210 --> 01:43:49,230
There's always going to be bumper 
stickers.

1817
01:43:49,270 --> 01:43:49,620
All there's

1818
01:43:49,630 --> 01:43:52,290
going to be bumper stickers.
You cannot avoid.

1819
01:43:52,310 --> 01:43:55,930
This thing is not the real thing because
of the effect.

1820
01:43:55,960 --> 01:44:00,960
It's very true and in reality it's a 
small percentage of the yoga people that

1821
01:44:01,421 --> 01:44:03,790
are fake.
It's a tiny percentage and if you,

1822
01:44:04,270 --> 01:44:06,910
and if you think about the general 
scammers in the population,

1823
01:44:07,060 --> 01:44:12,060
there's always going to be issues with 
men in male ego and posturing and 

1824
01:44:12,761 --> 01:44:17,761
there's always going to be easy.
I mean similar issues with women and 

1825
01:44:17,761 --> 01:44:19,190
women dealing with other women,
but I,

1826
01:44:19,280 --> 01:44:22,750
I've seen the fake yoga man and I've 
seen the fake yoga woman.

1827
01:44:22,751 --> 01:44:27,460
I'll take the fake yoga woman everyday.
Fake yoga man is trying to get laid.

1828
01:44:27,790 --> 01:44:32,790
The fake yoga woman is just trying to be
pretend to be a little more spiritual 

1829
01:44:34,061 --> 01:44:36,910
and not materialistic than she truly is,
but the fake yoga man,

1830
01:44:36,911 --> 01:44:38,500
it's just trying to get laid.
He's annoying

1831
01:44:39,560 --> 01:44:44,560
and then maybe one out of 100,
but that's enough that these things.

1832
01:44:46,170 --> 01:44:51,170
I think that some people will get into 
the new age movement with the idea of 

1833
01:44:52,850 --> 01:44:55,840
finding relationship,
which in a way of course is finding.

1834
01:44:55,960 --> 01:44:58,810
I love how you just put that,
know what they're doing.

1835
01:44:58,811 --> 01:45:03,811
they're trying to get some pussy.
There's a big difference between find a 

1836
01:45:03,811 --> 01:45:03,811
relationship and just

1837
01:45:03,811 --> 01:45:06,050
sometimes they tend to be just finding a
one night stand,

1838
01:45:06,051 --> 01:45:08,430
which is of course their language is 
quite accurate.

1839
01:45:11,480 --> 01:45:16,480
Well,
I think it's they're trying to appear 

1840
01:45:16,480 --> 01:45:19,770
desirable and one of the ways to appear 
desirable to women to be introduced,

1841
01:45:20,360 --> 01:45:22,310
which is supposed to be spiritual.
Yes.

1842
01:45:22,340 --> 01:45:23,230
Yeah.
That's a trick.

1843
01:45:23,760 --> 01:45:27,820
That is all true and I'm sure that as 
quantum physics,

1844
01:45:29,530 --> 01:45:30,460
quantum fakers

1845
01:45:32,390 --> 01:45:37,390
fakers,
and I'm not trying to focus entirely on 

1846
01:45:37,390 --> 01:45:40,771
the negative,
but I'm trying to address what I know 

1847
01:45:40,771 --> 01:45:41,860
people in the general public,
the issues that they have with,

1848
01:45:41,861 --> 01:45:46,861
with folks that claim to be spiritual.
It's like you'll run into a fake yoga 

1849
01:45:46,861 --> 01:45:47,530
person and you're like,
oh my god,

1850
01:45:47,531 --> 01:45:50,290
you know,
either the typically unique guy with his

1851
01:45:50,320 --> 01:45:54,250
beads and this is hemp sandals and you 
just want to punch them.

1852
01:45:54,251 --> 01:45:55,300
Right.
You know what I'm talking about?

1853
01:45:55,540 --> 01:46:00,540
Like didn't you have to wait?
You have to be patient looking at the 

1854
01:46:00,540 --> 01:46:00,720
other side.
Tell you a story,

1855
01:46:01,780 --> 01:46:06,010
a typical hinduism teaching story.
Okay.

1856
01:46:06,380 --> 01:46:11,380
So if tiff comes to the master spiritual
master and the at the end of the night,

1857
01:46:14,811 --> 01:46:17,660
which are master of course stay with me.
No problem.

1858
01:46:18,170 --> 01:46:21,680
So the toughest stealing this stuff,
all the whole thing.

1859
01:46:22,640 --> 01:46:26,540
So the buster opens the eyes and says,
do you remember,

1860
01:46:26,541 --> 01:46:28,850
did you remember to take everything 
because you know,

1861
01:46:28,851 --> 01:46:33,170
I really don't need that stuff over 
there either so you can take that tube.

1862
01:46:33,950 --> 01:46:36,440
So tip is caught.
But he's very surprised.

1863
01:46:36,530 --> 01:46:41,530
Know master is not throwing him in jail 
or the police or anything like that.

1864
01:46:42,170 --> 01:46:47,170
So he's become a little curious.
So he lays things down the way or you 

1865
01:46:47,170 --> 01:46:49,840
not angry because I'm feeling your stuff
right?

1866
01:46:50,470 --> 01:46:53,280
I said for most of this stuff,
look,

1867
01:46:53,281 --> 01:46:54,720
I don't really need it.

1868
01:46:54,780 --> 01:46:58,140
I still have attachments so I keep them.
So if you're taking notes,

1869
01:46:58,170 --> 01:47:03,170
okay.
So it beComes a littLe more curious and 

1870
01:47:03,170 --> 01:47:03,170
it says,
well,

1871
01:47:03,170 --> 01:47:06,120
since you don't mind me stealing it 
anytime,

1872
01:47:06,840 --> 01:47:09,360
why should I have to steal it at the end
of the night?

1873
01:47:09,420 --> 01:47:13,410
Let me stay with you for a few days just
watching your metrics and what you do.

1874
01:47:13,740 --> 01:47:15,840
Then I'll take them awaY.
At the end of the week,

1875
01:47:15,980 --> 01:47:16,790
my son says,
yeah,

1876
01:47:16,810 --> 01:47:18,120
fine,
just stay with me,

1877
01:47:18,660 --> 01:47:23,660
so it just stays for a few days as he 
looks at the master and tries to do some

1878
01:47:27,781 --> 01:47:32,781
of the stuff.
He sTarts changing by faking.

1879
01:47:33,180 --> 01:47:38,180
Initially he thought you'll just fake 
the monster because then he'll pick up 

1880
01:47:38,180 --> 01:47:41,661
the faking and then his stealing 
capacity will increase manifold because 

1881
01:47:41,661 --> 01:47:43,680
it will impress people by being a 
spiritual man.

1882
01:47:44,190 --> 01:47:47,220
People will have.
You will have more access to more houses

1883
01:47:47,221 --> 01:47:48,750
and he will be able to steal more.

1884
01:47:49,110 --> 01:47:54,110
That was the origiNal idea.
This is why you wanted to watch the 

1885
01:47:54,110 --> 01:47:55,860
master,
but then as It did two things,

1886
01:47:56,310 --> 01:48:01,310
meditate and sit and talk to people.
After even a few days it started 

1887
01:48:02,971 --> 01:48:07,971
changing sodium so it can begin with the
fake and ended up with something else 

1888
01:48:10,860 --> 01:48:13,020
and of course master knew it all the 
time.

1889
01:48:13,021 --> 01:48:15,180
So at the end of the seven days,
master says,

1890
01:48:15,390 --> 01:48:17,580
okay,
now you take this stuff and leave.

1891
01:48:17,640 --> 01:48:22,640
Why are you belonging your stage and the
and the and the fellow calls on the 

1892
01:48:22,921 --> 01:48:27,921
feed.
That's an indian medium of saying 

1893
01:48:27,921 --> 01:48:27,921
surrender subsets that,
no,

1894
01:48:27,921 --> 01:48:31,470
I want to learn what makes it you.
I'm not interested in stealing the small

1895
01:48:31,471 --> 01:48:36,471
stuff anymore.
I want to steal the stuff that you are 

1896
01:48:36,471 --> 01:48:38,961
made up so it's so where we can make 
even use sub this faith is.

1897
01:48:43,580 --> 01:48:48,580
It's amazing by being patient with the 
people who are faking and just allowing 

1898
01:48:48,580 --> 01:48:52,521
them in the process because although the
initial intention is superficial,

1899
01:48:55,020 --> 01:48:58,800
but as you ruled them,
consumption itself,

1900
01:48:59,460 --> 01:49:04,460
consuming this very wonderful stuff,
very wonderful behavior will begin to 

1901
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:06,930
give the idea.

1902
01:49:07,010 --> 01:49:12,010
Or maybe I can become a producer.
these energies that I faked by 

1903
01:49:12,720 --> 01:49:15,510
meditating,
if I actualize them,

1904
01:49:15,810 --> 01:49:20,810
then they will actually produce changes 
in meta profound and um,

1905
01:49:22,300 --> 01:49:26,580
which should open the gates for that 
rather than closing it by saying,

1906
01:49:26,610 --> 01:49:29,070
oh,
you are just a fake instead.

1907
01:49:30,200 --> 01:49:32,520
No,
we're a little more tolerant about them.

1908
01:49:33,740 --> 01:49:38,740
I am.
I am kind of losing the quantum 

1909
01:49:38,740 --> 01:49:41,571
language.
Although they have no idea what they're 

1910
01:49:41,571 --> 01:49:41,571
talking about.
But then,

1911
01:49:41,571 --> 01:49:45,210
but then you explain it one time and 
they'll become a little curious.

1912
01:49:45,211 --> 01:49:50,211
And initially their curiosity will be,
I can pick up a little more and impress 

1913
01:49:50,211 --> 01:49:50,850
people a little more medevac,
covenantal,

1914
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:52,560
more curious,
more curious.

1915
01:49:52,570 --> 01:49:54,070
One day they'll ask,
well,

1916
01:49:54,160 --> 01:49:58,600
can I actually start doing this stuff?
And really be creative.

1917
01:50:00,140 --> 01:50:02,150
Wow.
Didn't find in one,

1918
01:50:02,151 --> 01:50:07,151
said,
if you think you understand quantum 

1919
01:50:07,151 --> 01:50:07,151
mechanics,
you don't understand quantum mechanics,

1920
01:50:07,700 --> 01:50:09,360
uh,
well,

1921
01:50:09,370 --> 01:50:11,410
one of them now,
many,

1922
01:50:11,411 --> 01:50:12,310
many sayings.

1923
01:50:13,180 --> 01:50:16,690
This could come from niels bohr who said
that if we will talk to you,

1924
01:50:16,730 --> 01:50:21,730
understood quantum physics,
then probably didn't understand it at 

1925
01:50:21,730 --> 01:50:22,780
all.
So that many,

1926
01:50:22,810 --> 01:50:25,270
many,
many things about quantum physics,

1927
01:50:25,360 --> 01:50:28,240
man said something like,
nobody understands quantum physics.

1928
01:50:28,560 --> 01:50:33,560
One time he did say something like that.
So why do people say something like 

1929
01:50:34,091 --> 01:50:39,091
that?
Because quantum physics at some level 

1930
01:50:39,091 --> 01:50:42,300
becomes so incredibly mysterious that 
India,

1931
01:50:43,431 --> 01:50:45,970
first of matter consciousness can be 
involved.

1932
01:50:45,971 --> 01:50:50,971
This is just such a inherent mystery.
Many people are savvy,

1933
01:50:51,470 --> 01:50:56,470
heart put to accept this kind of thing.
So they would rather have nobody 

1934
01:50:56,470 --> 01:51:01,381
understands quantum mechanics then 
except that consciousness is needed to 

1935
01:51:01,661 --> 01:51:06,661
understand quantum mechanics.
So these are the barriers of new 

1936
01:51:07,271 --> 01:51:09,790
thinking coming into the field of 
science.

1937
01:51:10,240 --> 01:51:15,240
But you know what,
because experimentally we are verifying 

1938
01:51:15,240 --> 01:51:19,030
the idea of nonlocal consciousness.
We are verifying the idea that really 

1939
01:51:19,030 --> 01:51:23,851
eased at nonlocal connection between 
people or the way we got knowledge named

1940
01:51:26,240 --> 01:51:28,660
the consciousness is actually nonlocal.

1941
01:51:29,320 --> 01:51:34,320
that verification will go a long way in 
changing the paradigm,

1942
01:51:34,661 --> 01:51:37,960
changing the world.
How did yoga get discovered?

1943
01:51:37,990 --> 01:51:42,990
How did they figure out that these poses
and stretches could open up your mind 

1944
01:51:42,990 --> 01:51:42,990
and,
and,

1945
01:51:42,990 --> 01:51:44,530
and,
and change your consciousness.

1946
01:51:44,531 --> 01:51:45,040
What,
what is,

1947
01:51:45,070 --> 01:51:46,600
what is the history behind that?
Well,

1948
01:51:47,140 --> 01:51:50,680
the original,
if you read patanjali's yoga sutra,

1949
01:51:50,980 --> 01:51:55,980
he just introduced us author yoga as a 
way of finding a comfortable place to 

1950
01:51:56,771 --> 01:52:01,771
meditate.
Originally the idea was just to sit 

1951
01:52:01,771 --> 01:52:06,421
comfortably and in order to sit 
comfortably in meditation for a long 

1952
01:52:06,421 --> 01:52:07,560
period of time.
Stretching helps,

1953
01:52:08,110 --> 01:52:10,960
and then they discovered one very 
wonderful thing.

1954
01:52:11,050 --> 01:52:16,050
As people meditated the bain job of 
meditation,

1955
01:52:17,770 --> 01:52:20,680
they found this to create gap between 
tots.

1956
01:52:21,010 --> 01:52:26,010
You slow down your mental process.
So once they discovered that the idea of

1957
01:52:27,821 --> 01:52:32,170
slowing down the mental process helps 
enormously,

1958
01:52:32,290 --> 01:52:36,520
or creativity or spirituality.
Once they found that out,

1959
01:52:36,850 --> 01:52:41,850
then they realized the next wonderful 
thing is that isn't yoga also a way of 

1960
01:52:41,861 --> 01:52:46,861
slowing down.
The body Is in front I a way of slowing 

1961
01:52:46,861 --> 01:52:47,690
down the breaths and therefore all the 
arguments,

1962
01:52:48,050 --> 01:52:51,100
so the interest group at your eight 
self,

1963
01:52:51,140 --> 01:52:56,140
I'll tell you a gauge self is not just 
stretching or just working on the 

1964
01:52:57,050 --> 01:53:02,050
joints.
It's also weird to slow down the body 

1965
01:53:02,050 --> 01:53:05,800
and therefore the mind is alternately it
indirectly slowing down the wind because

1966
01:53:05,961 --> 01:53:07,970
if the body is slow,
wind will also be slow

1967
01:53:08,190 --> 01:53:12,190
by focusing on the poses and your breath
in your throat.

1968
01:53:12,690 --> 01:53:15,660
Not so much like bikram Yoga,
fast yoga,

1969
01:53:16,170 --> 01:53:18,310
but in the original way that you've 
done.

1970
01:53:18,390 --> 01:53:23,390
That's quite slow.
The slow yoga is actually even better 

1971
01:53:23,390 --> 01:53:24,060
than the first year,
but not at the festival.

1972
01:53:24,061 --> 01:53:26,520
Loses everything of yoga festival is 
also good,

1973
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:31,740
but they'd be even better because it 
slows down.

1974
01:53:31,741 --> 01:53:35,250
The body slows down,
the mind slows down.

1975
01:53:35,251 --> 01:53:38,520
The vital energies slows down our 
emotions.

1976
01:53:38,790 --> 01:53:41,970
It gives you a lot of breaths between 
your fast,

1977
01:53:41,971 --> 01:53:42,810
fast,
fast go,

1978
01:53:42,811 --> 01:53:43,500
go,
go mind,

1979
01:53:43,970 --> 01:53:48,970
and especially important for developing 
creativity because creativity is 

1980
01:53:48,970 --> 01:53:51,690
enormously dependent on that unconscious
processing,

1981
01:53:51,691 --> 01:53:54,840
doing nothing,
do and be so.

1982
01:53:54,940 --> 01:53:58,110
If we do yoga regularly,
we really don't differ.

1983
01:53:58,111 --> 01:54:03,111
Need meditation or goodwill day,
we can just do yoga and get the benefit 

1984
01:54:04,141 --> 01:54:09,141
on the mind from yoga,
lower that that is goes a long way for 

1985
01:54:09,211 --> 01:54:10,200
our creativity.

1986
01:54:10,720 --> 01:54:15,040
There's a lot of ancient texts that 
connect yoga with cannabis,

1987
01:54:15,041 --> 01:54:20,041
use yoga with how she shoes and and and 
even eating cannabis.

1988
01:54:21,410 --> 01:54:23,650
Are you familiar with this?
you're now familiar with.

1989
01:54:23,651 --> 01:54:24,310
Oh,
look aT you.

1990
01:54:24,311 --> 01:54:26,770
Your slide devil with that smile on your
face.

1991
01:54:27,250 --> 01:54:30,880
Someone's got a reputation to maintain 
and no,

1992
01:54:32,020 --> 01:54:34,630
I don't really know that.
From that point of view.

1993
01:54:34,910 --> 01:54:37,810
Do you have any experience at all in a 
psychedelic?

1994
01:54:39,510 --> 01:54:41,310
I do.
A little less certain tried.

1995
01:54:41,760 --> 01:54:46,760
I've been in this faith if it's not 
against the law to what do you mean?

1996
01:54:47,470 --> 01:54:48,340
Marijuana?
Yes.

1997
01:54:48,360 --> 01:54:53,360
You have to take a very mild or atlanta.
So I was going to ask you about some 

1998
01:54:53,360 --> 01:54:57,170
mild in one time and one time what it's 
about samsung or something very 

1999
01:54:58,970 --> 01:55:00,970
familiar.
I'll look at your old school devil.

2000
01:55:01,420 --> 01:55:02,410
Exactly.
So,

2001
01:55:02,520 --> 01:55:07,520
so a friend of mine comes from 
Washington with the Washington,

2002
01:55:08,381 --> 01:55:10,840
don't play games exact seattle's in the 
house.

2003
01:55:11,890 --> 01:55:12,770
So,
so,

2004
01:55:12,910 --> 01:55:13,600
so,
uh,

2005
01:55:13,620 --> 01:55:18,620
we,
we take this stuff with him and we put 

2006
01:55:18,620 --> 01:55:18,620
it in cookies,
right?

2007
01:55:18,620 --> 01:55:20,410
Oh yeah.
And iT doesn't,

2008
01:55:20,440 --> 01:55:23,950
it doesn't take effect for an hour and 
20 minutes,

2009
01:55:23,960 --> 01:55:25,750
20 minutes,
nothing is happening.

2010
01:55:26,110 --> 01:55:26,740
So we said,
well,

2011
01:55:26,741 --> 01:55:29,200
let's go to dinner.
This is a classic story.

2012
01:55:32,150 --> 01:55:36,670
We go to dinner and all of a sudden I'm 
just eating my first course.

2013
01:55:37,180 --> 01:55:41,800
I'm looking at the,
looking at the lights of the city from a

2014
01:55:41,801 --> 01:55:44,610
window and it starts exploding.

2015
01:55:46,230 --> 01:55:51,180
Wonderful.
So my wife was the third question on the

2016
01:55:51,181 --> 01:55:56,181
table.
She also starts feeling something and 

2017
01:55:56,181 --> 01:56:00,650
she has to go to the bathroom.
So she goes on the way back from the 

2018
01:56:00,650 --> 01:56:01,980
bathroom,
she passes out.

2019
01:56:02,610 --> 01:56:06,010
Whoa.
So I'd have to,

2020
01:56:06,860 --> 01:56:09,300
I have to go and try that.
Okay.

2021
01:56:09,301 --> 01:56:10,350
This is my woman.

2022
01:56:12,580 --> 01:56:16,720
I will take her.
I had to.

2023
01:56:19,060 --> 01:56:24,060
Anything.
So probably she got weak and therefore 

2024
01:56:24,060 --> 01:56:24,060
best out,
don't pay any attention to her.

2025
01:56:24,060 --> 01:56:28,701
I'll take care of it.
And this friend or people from 

2026
01:56:28,701 --> 01:56:29,580
Washington,
they have to watch them.

2027
01:56:29,890 --> 01:56:32,640
This friend doesn't know me.
He doesn't know her.

2028
01:56:32,940 --> 01:56:37,940
Just walks away completely.
It doEsn't go anywhere.

2029
01:56:37,980 --> 01:56:40,430
It just left you guys there.
Just left those guys there.

2030
01:56:40,460 --> 01:56:41,480
Wow.
What an asshole.

2031
01:56:41,481 --> 01:56:44,990
That guy is.
He caught up and apologize.

2032
01:56:45,070 --> 01:56:46,430
Oh,
eventually.

2033
01:56:47,060 --> 01:56:49,130
Did he know that you guys had taken pot 
cookies?

2034
01:56:49,820 --> 01:56:51,650
Cookie or a brownie?
Wasn't he was taking.

2035
01:56:51,720 --> 01:56:55,590
We're gonna go to jail.
I didn't want to be a part of it.

2036
01:56:55,591 --> 01:57:00,591
I still get caught up in that.
In that difficult situation in the 

2037
01:57:00,591 --> 01:57:04,631
future.
And for folks who have never heard me 

2038
01:57:04,631 --> 01:57:06,401
say this before,
even though I've said it a million 

2039
01:57:06,401 --> 01:57:06,401
times,
when you eat cannabis,

2040
01:57:06,401 --> 01:57:06,750
that has a completely different 
psychoactive effect,

2041
01:57:06,780 --> 01:57:08,300
right?
When you're telling me,

2042
01:57:08,930 --> 01:57:09,370
yeah.

2043
01:57:12,080 --> 01:57:17,080
When cannabis is processed by the liver 
produces something called 11 hydroxy 

2044
01:57:17,080 --> 01:57:21,161
metabolite,
which is a approximately four to five 

2045
01:57:21,161 --> 01:57:24,161
times more psychoactive than thc.
So that's why It has that insane effect.

2046
01:57:24,471 --> 01:57:29,471
It's not just insane.
It's an alien effect that you don't get 

2047
01:57:29,471 --> 01:57:29,471
when you smoke pot eating.
It is a very,

2048
01:57:29,471 --> 01:57:33,860
very different experience and you could 
easily overdo it and it looks like maybe

2049
01:57:33,861 --> 01:57:35,330
your wife just got so hot.
She's like,

2050
01:57:35,331 --> 01:57:37,070
I'm just going to pretend to be blacked 
out.

2051
01:57:37,130 --> 01:57:39,350
It's way less stressful than walking 
around.

2052
01:57:39,590 --> 01:57:44,590
Well,
she did say that she was faking 

2053
01:57:44,590 --> 01:57:44,590
interdental bit.

2054
01:57:44,590 --> 01:57:44,590
See,

2055
01:57:48,130 --> 01:57:51,160
she did have to lie down and they fed 
them anonymous.

2056
01:57:51,161 --> 01:57:56,161
affect mine to be under it and then 
driving under it,

2057
01:57:56,810 --> 01:57:59,570
you know,
this is why I don't really like the idea

2058
01:57:59,571 --> 01:58:04,571
of legalizing marijuana in a sense 
because driving with marijuana at least 

2059
01:58:06,480 --> 01:58:08,930
be oral kind.
It's very,

2060
01:58:08,931 --> 01:58:13,931
very difficult to.
I mean I tell that driving experience 

2061
01:58:13,931 --> 01:58:15,770
was the most difficult power in my 
entire life.

2062
01:58:15,800 --> 01:58:18,710
I've never had that.
It just,

2063
01:58:18,711 --> 01:58:22,280
it's impossible to gauge time.
How time is going,

2064
01:58:23,360 --> 01:58:24,620
time.
There's fast.

2065
01:58:27,480 --> 01:58:32,480
Did it change?
Did it change your ideas of the quantum 

2066
01:58:32,480 --> 01:58:34,380
world pot brownies.
So like connected to.

2067
01:58:39,540 --> 01:58:42,250
This was before the,
before the discoveries

2068
01:58:42,250 --> 01:58:44,860
of quantum physics that I went through,
but really those,

2069
01:58:44,861 --> 01:58:49,861
this is pre quantum physics quantum era,
the early eighties.

2070
01:58:50,650 --> 01:58:52,620
So in the early eighties,
you were a standard.

2071
01:58:52,621 --> 01:58:56,740
A nuclear theorists are struggling.
I already came out of bed,

2072
01:58:56,800 --> 01:59:01,800
but I had not found.
I discovered the new possibilities of 

2073
01:59:01,800 --> 01:59:01,870
quantum physics.
Yeah,

2074
01:59:01,900 --> 01:59:04,030
yeah.
Before you discovered all this stuff,

2075
01:59:04,050 --> 01:59:05,740
you weren't really a happy guy,
were you?

2076
01:59:05,860 --> 01:59:07,660
No,
that was a very unhappy guy.

2077
01:59:07,661 --> 01:59:08,450
In fact,
you know,

2078
01:59:08,740 --> 01:59:09,550
my,
my,

2079
01:59:09,610 --> 01:59:12,400
uh,
my change came only after I realized it.

2080
01:59:12,880 --> 01:59:16,450
one day I was at a conference on nuclear
physics giving a paper,

2081
01:59:16,690 --> 01:59:18,010
erudite paper,
of course,

2082
01:59:18,100 --> 01:59:22,060
nothing to do with everyday life and I 
give this paper gusto.

2083
01:59:22,180 --> 01:59:27,180
Nobody appreciates it at this.
So I taught and I think that the other 

2084
01:59:27,180 --> 01:59:31,021
guys,
although they are talking about equally 

2085
01:59:31,021 --> 01:59:33,300
esoteric nonsense,
but they are much more appreciated by 

2086
01:59:33,300 --> 01:59:37,141
the audience and at the party,
especially by the women.

2087
01:59:37,480 --> 01:59:38,260
The first sex.

2088
01:59:38,690 --> 01:59:42,030
Oh,
I'm jealous.

2089
01:59:42,031 --> 01:59:43,440
I'm just jealous,
jealous,

2090
01:59:43,441 --> 01:59:43,760
jealous.

2091
01:59:43,780 --> 01:59:45,910
Sending that equipped.
And that way,

2092
01:59:45,911 --> 01:59:48,940
the whole party,
the whole evening at 1:00,

2093
01:59:49,660 --> 01:59:52,810
I get disgusted with myself because all 
my pumps are gone.

2094
01:59:52,990 --> 01:59:53,480
You know,
this,

2095
01:59:53,850 --> 01:59:57,750
tom's digestive hard buttons,
pills you eat,

2096
01:59:57,751 --> 02:00:01,950
a lot of times those days you weren't,
you were upset.

2097
02:00:02,080 --> 02:00:04,840
I'm upSet,
so I go outside this,

2098
02:00:04,841 --> 02:00:08,020
this is that on the on the monterrey 
bay,

2099
02:00:08,320 --> 02:00:13,320
rePlace Scott Russell.
Omar and I have this ocean breeze hit my

2100
02:00:14,111 --> 02:00:17,170
face and I thought,
why do I live this way?

2101
02:00:17,320 --> 02:00:22,320
They this happy with so I literally,
I literally avowedly was the 

2102
02:00:23,501 --> 02:00:25,510
practitioner of happy physics since 
then.

2103
02:00:26,680 --> 02:00:30,580
Of course I didn't find it immediately 
the way to be happy doing physics,

2104
02:00:30,581 --> 02:00:33,760
but eventually found it is 
consciousness.

2105
02:00:33,761 --> 02:00:38,761
Physics is happy,
happiest years of physics that I ever 

2106
02:00:39,310 --> 02:00:39,850
hoped.

2107
02:00:40,610 --> 02:00:42,470
So what?
What was this change though?

2108
02:00:42,471 --> 02:00:43,910
You,
you're sitting out there.

2109
02:00:43,911 --> 02:00:46,940
The water hits your face.
he's thinking and what?

2110
02:00:47,020 --> 02:00:49,460
Think it's an intuitive thought to 
change one's life.

2111
02:00:49,730 --> 02:00:53,810
This is the kind of thing that happens 
all of a sudden and you are not the same

2112
02:00:53,811 --> 02:00:55,220
anymore,
but you're not.

2113
02:00:55,221 --> 02:00:58,490
You weren't like descartes was visited 
by an angel in his dreams.

2114
02:00:59,170 --> 02:01:00,640
You know what I'm saying?
Like your changes.

2115
02:01:00,710 --> 02:01:02,930
Like I just went outside and I'm like,
fuck this,

2116
02:01:02,960 --> 02:01:04,170
you know,
on mushrooms,

2117
02:01:05,320 --> 02:01:05,970
not the.
No,

2118
02:01:06,220 --> 02:01:07,250
no drugs,
nothing.

2119
02:01:07,290 --> 02:01:12,290
It was a moment that intuition at moment
of knowing yourself because I was ready 

2120
02:01:13,570 --> 02:01:18,570
to look at myself.
You were ready to look at yourself 

2121
02:01:18,570 --> 02:01:18,570
because before you weren't

2122
02:01:18,570 --> 02:01:23,490
before I wasn't before.
It didn't matter to me that the physics 

2123
02:01:23,490 --> 02:01:26,941
that I do has nothing to say about the 
life that I live and all of a sudden I 

2124
02:01:26,941 --> 02:01:31,681
wanted to really live a meaningful life.
I wanted to do something that has 

2125
02:01:31,681 --> 02:01:36,030
meaning,
not just in west to get ahead in my 

2126
02:01:36,030 --> 02:01:37,320
profession.
So I wanted to integrate.

2127
02:01:37,330 --> 02:01:40,490
I want to integrate my professional with
my daily life,

2128
02:01:40,760 --> 02:01:45,760
how to love my wife.
I put up children how to get on with 

2129
02:01:45,760 --> 02:01:45,760
trends better,
you know,

2130
02:01:45,760 --> 02:01:49,130
live life,
not just to physics formulas and publish

2131
02:01:49,160 --> 02:01:51,530
papers and get promotions in the 
department.

2132
02:01:52,750 --> 02:01:54,640
Wow.
So it was just one moment.

2133
02:01:54,641 --> 02:01:58,060
You just had enough and that's when you 
went into the woo world.

2134
02:01:58,720 --> 02:02:00,050
Well,
quantum mechanics,

2135
02:02:00,100 --> 02:02:01,210
not immediate.
Slowly,

2136
02:02:01,390 --> 02:02:03,940
slowly and um,
a lot of struggle,

2137
02:02:03,941 --> 02:02:07,510
a lot of experimentation,
a lot of steps in between.

2138
02:02:07,620 --> 02:02:10,450
It took a lot of time too.
This was 1973.

2139
02:02:10,530 --> 02:02:15,530
I might discover a kevin 1985.
So 12 years of quite a risky,

2140
02:02:17,750 --> 02:02:21,300
adventurous path,
but words came.

2141
02:02:22,230 --> 02:02:27,230
Now there's another thing that you said 
that I read that I found completely 

2142
02:02:27,230 --> 02:02:30,240
fascinating is that you don't believe in
freewill.

2143
02:02:31,330 --> 02:02:33,280
Well,
I do and I don't.

2144
02:02:33,650 --> 02:02:38,650
You do it in the sense that yes,
creativity has the component of favor.

2145
02:02:40,030 --> 02:02:42,250
Well,
it starts with the free will of the ego.

2146
02:02:42,940 --> 02:02:47,940
Ego has one freewill,
but she's very crucial element of 

2147
02:02:47,940 --> 02:02:48,970
creativity,
which is bad.

2148
02:02:49,480 --> 02:02:54,480
At some point they got to realize this,
that it really does not know and 

2149
02:02:56,951 --> 02:03:00,160
therefore start saying no to all 
conditioning,

2150
02:03:00,430 --> 02:03:03,420
nor to condition meanings.
Now to condition habits,

2151
02:03:03,421 --> 02:03:06,580
no to condition patterns,
nor to condition behavior,

2152
02:03:06,790 --> 02:03:10,360
and that's when we make room.
That's when you have an open mind.

2153
02:03:10,420 --> 02:03:15,420
We make room for learning new stuff and 
that's when creativity can come to us 

2154
02:03:16,331 --> 02:03:21,331
before then we start really thinking 
that we know it all with our reservoir 

2155
02:03:22,721 --> 02:03:25,660
of knowledge because I have a lot of 
expertise.

2156
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:30,280
Therefore I know that expert is don't 
bring us knowledge.

2157
02:03:30,281 --> 02:03:35,281
Expertise just bring us a very special 
fraction of knowledge that is useful to 

2158
02:03:36,041 --> 02:03:41,041
solve certain problems that would given 
context because the context is known.

2159
02:03:42,490 --> 02:03:44,230
Therefore,
the expertise always says,

2160
02:03:44,231 --> 02:03:49,231
well,
somewhere in my expertise there is an 

2161
02:03:49,231 --> 02:03:51,361
answer and it will develop a habit of 
finding that answer fairly quickly and 

2162
02:03:51,791 --> 02:03:53,530
people,
people admire that.

2163
02:03:53,531 --> 02:03:58,531
Of course you go ahead in your society 
because they are very efficient problem 

2164
02:03:58,531 --> 02:04:03,211
solver,
but I they did sing that happens with an

2165
02:04:03,581 --> 02:04:08,581
open mind.
They start to realize that there is a 

2166
02:04:08,581 --> 02:04:10,090
real life.
Problems are not given within contexts.

2167
02:04:10,690 --> 02:04:15,690
The contexts are not given to you.
You have to discover not only the new 

2168
02:04:15,690 --> 02:04:17,410
meaning,
but also the new context of it.

2169
02:04:17,680 --> 02:04:20,680
And this is what makes real life 
problems very difficult.

2170
02:04:20,681 --> 02:04:23,800
This is why we're touching about this 
earlier.

2171
02:04:24,310 --> 02:04:25,690
We don't learn that stuff,
you know,

2172
02:04:25,691 --> 02:04:30,691
they sent her brother are sitting in me 
how to integrate that with the abstract 

2173
02:04:30,691 --> 02:04:34,300
thinker of today.
This is not given in any book.

2174
02:04:34,390 --> 02:04:36,520
They said,
not given within given context.

2175
02:04:36,930 --> 02:04:39,240
So how do you get into this kind of 
thing?

2176
02:04:39,250 --> 02:04:41,790
Have To creativity.
You have to become open first.

2177
02:04:41,820 --> 02:04:46,820
That okay with this rational mind,
which has only learned about abstract 

2178
02:04:46,820 --> 02:04:48,770
thinking.
You're not going to integrate our,

2179
02:04:48,780 --> 02:04:51,780
my emotions of the hunter gatherer days,
uh,

2180
02:04:51,781 --> 02:04:54,900
with the one that is today who is all 
the suppressed emotions.

2181
02:04:54,910 --> 02:04:57,360
They're not going to integrate.
We have to open up,

2182
02:04:57,540 --> 02:05:02,540
we have to recognize our ignorance 
completely and invite creativity in our 

2183
02:05:02,581 --> 02:05:04,530
life.
so that idea,

2184
02:05:04,531 --> 02:05:09,210
that idea was the most important idea 
probably that eventually,

2185
02:05:09,360 --> 02:05:10,950
you know,
changed me as a person.

2186
02:05:12,480 --> 02:05:14,760
Wow.
So the,

2187
02:05:14,940 --> 02:05:19,940
the idea that is so insane.
I'm sorry,

2188
02:05:20,071 --> 02:05:22,760
this is hard,
hard way to hurt a widow,

2189
02:05:23,310 --> 02:05:27,090
wrap your head around it,
but in saying that you have freewill and

2190
02:05:27,091 --> 02:05:28,740
you don't have free will at the same 
time.

2191
02:05:28,830 --> 02:05:30,720
So this is,
this is the freewill.

2192
02:05:30,830 --> 02:05:34,470
This said this is the free world,
but in other things with what is our,

2193
02:05:34,590 --> 02:05:36,160
well,
what choices,

2194
02:05:36,330 --> 02:05:38,550
what flavor,
what flavor of ice cream?

2195
02:05:38,930 --> 02:05:40,710
Well left or right,
good or bad,

2196
02:05:42,580 --> 02:05:44,750
on the basis of what you know already,
right?

2197
02:05:44,940 --> 02:05:49,940
Well,
basis of what you know and what you've 

2198
02:05:49,940 --> 02:05:49,940
learned and what we admire in someone 
who's learned.

2199
02:05:49,940 --> 02:05:51,020
Exactly.
Someone who evolved.

2200
02:05:51,050 --> 02:05:51,350
Exactly.

2201
02:05:51,480 --> 02:05:53,990
Okay.
So on the basis of the known,

2202
02:05:54,350 --> 02:05:59,350
all the answers are conditioned among 
the condition spectrum of knowledge and 

2203
02:05:59,350 --> 02:06:01,220
that that's really not,
you know,

2204
02:06:01,260 --> 02:06:04,910
it's sort of freedom,
but there's nothing to kroger.

2205
02:06:05,320 --> 02:06:06,310
It's freedom.
I mean,

2206
02:06:06,560 --> 02:06:09,950
nobody would give up that freedom if it 
tied and comes and says that,

2207
02:06:09,951 --> 02:06:11,050
no,
you don't have the.

2208
02:06:11,350 --> 02:06:15,620
You don't have the choice to choose a 
flavor of ice cream even I have.

2209
02:06:15,640 --> 02:06:18,410
You have to.
You have to take only one flavor.

2210
02:06:18,800 --> 02:06:23,800
Of course,
all of us would object and immediately 

2211
02:06:23,800 --> 02:06:23,800
we know we don't want that will become 
rebellious,

2212
02:06:24,080 --> 02:06:29,080
but it's that a different order of 
magnitude than what is needed to 

2213
02:06:30,771 --> 02:06:33,950
discover really new stuff.
That freedom,

2214
02:06:33,980 --> 02:06:35,400
that freedom,
which takes us to,

2215
02:06:35,401 --> 02:06:40,040
to really new and they're the ego's 
threewill is not very helpful.

2216
02:06:40,100 --> 02:06:45,100
We have to open up to what means 
spiritual tradition is called god's 

2217
02:06:45,100 --> 02:06:46,820
will.
Is that god separate from us?

2218
02:06:46,821 --> 02:06:50,960
No.
It's also our will in some sense,

2219
02:06:50,961 --> 02:06:55,961
but coming from a higher consciousness,
that's the difference coming from that 

2220
02:06:55,961 --> 02:06:59,381
nonlocal consciousness.
So real freedom of choice is beyond 

2221
02:06:59,381 --> 02:07:02,260
egos,
freewill to that freewill.

2222
02:07:02,270 --> 02:07:05,180
That enables me to choose creative 
answer.

2223
02:07:05,870 --> 02:07:07,670
Creativity,
well,

2224
02:07:08,990 --> 02:07:13,990
okay,
so real freewill only exist sort of in 

2225
02:07:14,211 --> 02:07:19,211
the base animalistic world and at the 
higher levels of consciousness,

2226
02:07:20,180 --> 02:07:25,180
free will doesn't exist because you're 
connected to the collective 

2227
02:07:25,180 --> 02:07:25,310
consciousness.

2228
02:07:25,740 --> 02:07:26,720
No,
no.

2229
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:30,340
Stay there a little bit inaccurate.
There was some accurate in it.

2230
02:07:30,510 --> 02:07:33,440
It it.
It does not exist necessarily.

2231
02:07:33,441 --> 02:07:36,850
Also in the non rational,
the in the emotional,

2232
02:07:36,880 --> 02:07:41,880
non rational experiences of the pre 
restaurant.

2233
02:07:42,790 --> 02:07:46,750
Either it comes to the,
comes from the intuition,

2234
02:07:46,870 --> 02:07:51,870
the next level,
so it really is the higher function 

2235
02:07:51,870 --> 02:07:53,260
except you're right.
In one sense,

2236
02:07:53,530 --> 02:07:58,530
if we go out outside of the irrational,
rational is our biggest enemy in defense

2237
02:07:59,680 --> 02:08:04,270
of free will,
in the higher sense is a bigger enemy of

2238
02:08:04,271 --> 02:08:06,340
intuition than already more sense.

2239
02:08:06,710 --> 02:08:11,000
Rationality is the restaurant,
and so the idea that you can rationalize

2240
02:08:11,001 --> 02:08:16,001
any evil or abusive behavior for the 
head of a corporation because it makes 

2241
02:08:16,001 --> 02:08:16,160
money for your

2242
02:08:16,260 --> 02:08:21,260
right,
that that restaurant I fashion is our 

2243
02:08:21,260 --> 02:08:23,721
biggest enemy.
Even bigger than emotions in defensive 

2244
02:08:23,721 --> 02:08:25,380
to include emotions,
to improve positive emotions,

2245
02:08:25,381 --> 02:08:28,890
positive emotions are very helpful too 
to intrusive.

2246
02:08:28,950 --> 02:08:31,260
So how would you describe what the 
rational thing is?

2247
02:08:31,261 --> 02:08:34,850
The biggest enemy of what that sort of 
thinking can also be a friend.

2248
02:08:34,851 --> 02:08:39,851
I don'T want to sound overly again.
Can be rationalized.

2249
02:08:41,310 --> 02:08:43,290
Everything you mean?
Rationalization,

2250
02:08:43,690 --> 02:08:45,000
stage,
rational thinking,

2251
02:08:45,570 --> 02:08:47,430
rational thinking is good generally.

2252
02:08:47,430 --> 02:08:50,880
But we don't do it all.
Only with that we can,

2253
02:08:50,910 --> 02:08:52,530
we can justify it.
Like today,

2254
02:08:52,531 --> 02:08:55,440
scientific materialists,
they justify everything,

2255
02:08:55,441 --> 02:08:57,180
all of their,
uh,

2256
02:08:57,750 --> 02:09:00,120
all of the.
Even the worldview itself,

2257
02:09:00,121 --> 02:09:05,121
right?
But that's not as a way that could not 

2258
02:09:05,121 --> 02:09:07,851
be spiritual.
It could not be god because everything 

2259
02:09:07,851 --> 02:09:07,851
has to be made up better.
What else can it be?

2260
02:09:07,851 --> 02:09:09,630
That's their,
that's their argument.

2261
02:09:09,631 --> 02:09:12,990
Basic argument just boils down to this.
What else can it be?

2262
02:09:13,220 --> 02:09:16,650
There is only this matters.
A pastime matter.

2263
02:09:16,740 --> 02:09:18,330
Muslim world.
That's nothing else.

2264
02:09:18,780 --> 02:09:23,190
If you started an assumption like that 
that's sort closed as you completely,

2265
02:09:23,350 --> 02:09:28,350
that's not freedom anymore,
he will lose freedom because you're not 

2266
02:09:28,350 --> 02:09:31,881
able to suspend your belief system.
If you suspend your belief system,

2267
02:09:32,340 --> 02:09:35,190
many other experiences immediately find 
meaning,

2268
02:09:35,250 --> 02:09:38,700
but it has this kind of reciprocity 
picked clothes,

2269
02:09:39,220 --> 02:09:41,310
emotions,
intuition.

2270
02:09:41,440 --> 02:09:44,880
There's a problem with the definition.
The word rational like you,

2271
02:09:44,920 --> 02:09:47,080
like you're being irrational,
you're not being right,

2272
02:09:47,110 --> 02:09:50,200
have some rational thinking and then 
rationalizing,

2273
02:09:50,201 --> 02:09:53,770
which is a negative.
It's a very strange,

2274
02:09:53,820 --> 02:09:55,970
but if the idea of taking it,
taking it

2275
02:09:55,970 --> 02:09:58,140
too far,
when is that rasterized?

2276
02:09:58,160 --> 02:10:03,160
WhaT we are really saying is that you 
are using restful thinking to where it 

2277
02:10:03,160 --> 02:10:05,150
does not belong.
That's rationalizing.

2278
02:10:05,180 --> 02:10:09,140
We'd asked analyze the way where 
intuition belongs to rationalize the way

2279
02:10:09,141 --> 02:10:11,560
her emotions belong.
So in Australia,

2280
02:10:11,600 --> 02:10:16,600
the new science,
the new science does it admits it's the 

2281
02:10:16,600 --> 02:10:19,400
science of experience,
not just a sensory experience.

2282
02:10:19,401 --> 02:10:24,401
That material is,
I'll agree with a new science says that 

2283
02:10:24,440 --> 02:10:29,440
our emotions,
our thinking and already intuition.

2284
02:10:30,320 --> 02:10:35,320
All three are valid ways of knowing and 
audition to sensitive.

2285
02:10:36,710 --> 02:10:40,130
So we have four valid ways of knowing 
physical,

2286
02:10:40,131 --> 02:10:42,080
vital,
mental and super mental,

2287
02:10:42,081 --> 02:10:47,081
deep intuition.
And when we imply all four ways of 

2288
02:10:47,081 --> 02:10:51,341
knowing,
we go beyond it as not being 

2289
02:10:51,341 --> 02:10:53,840
international being we go only the 
physical way of knowing and the mental 

2290
02:10:54,530 --> 02:10:56,780
rational,
logical way of knowing.

2291
02:10:56,960 --> 02:10:59,960
Michael shermer has a great point,
a great quote,

2292
02:10:59,961 --> 02:11:04,961
rather than the only thing smart people 
are better at rationalizing their dumb 

2293
02:11:04,961 --> 02:11:06,730
ideas,
which is a,

2294
02:11:06,830 --> 02:11:09,470
that's a very funny thing when it comes 
to certain,

2295
02:11:09,500 --> 02:11:11,090
uh,
certain focuses,

2296
02:11:11,091 --> 02:11:14,570
certain things people do rationalize,
you know,

2297
02:11:14,571 --> 02:11:18,230
whether it's a environmental disasters 
or you know,

2298
02:11:18,530 --> 02:11:22,700
doing things in other countries that are
unethical or immoral,

2299
02:11:23,040 --> 02:11:23,440
you know,
the,

2300
02:11:23,460 --> 02:11:28,460
the,
the ability to rationalize and 

2301
02:11:28,460 --> 02:11:29,740
especially the ability to rationalize on
a large scale like as a corporation is a

2302
02:11:30,040 --> 02:11:31,940
key problem with the civilization,
isn't it?

2303
02:11:32,050 --> 02:11:33,760
Keep prompting,
keep problem,

2304
02:11:34,180 --> 02:11:39,180
and how to get out of it.
I have a whole method of getting out of 

2305
02:11:39,180 --> 02:11:39,180
it.
How do we do it?

2306
02:11:39,180 --> 02:11:41,230
I call it spiritual economics.
This same idea,

2307
02:11:41,231 --> 02:11:43,660
like the earlier story that I told you 
this,

2308
02:11:43,661 --> 02:11:47,710
he found the wise person.
If it was that idea,

2309
02:11:47,920 --> 02:11:52,920
if we feed people these spiritual stuff 
as consumer good,

2310
02:11:53,720 --> 02:11:58,720
right?
Suppose you could go out in the market 

2311
02:11:58,720 --> 02:12:01,261
and buy happiness in the company of a 
sage was very being makes you happy.

2312
02:12:02,020 --> 02:12:04,120
I've met such people who were,
are at,

2313
02:12:04,900 --> 02:12:05,410
what do,
I mean?

2314
02:12:05,470 --> 02:12:06,580
Does that make you happy?
You can,

2315
02:12:06,650 --> 02:12:11,650
you can lead them a little bit difficult
because they don't appear in every the 

2316
02:12:12,010 --> 02:12:13,850
marketplace and not,
not,

2317
02:12:13,990 --> 02:12:14,230
no,
no,

2318
02:12:14,280 --> 02:12:19,280
not like steven greer's,
but we could manufacture these people.

2319
02:12:19,901 --> 02:12:24,901
I think We now have the key.
We know about creativity so much today 

2320
02:12:24,901 --> 02:12:29,520
that deep people are investing.
I think we really can inspire a lot of 

2321
02:12:33,191 --> 02:12:38,191
very capable people in a lifestyle which
will generate happy.

2322
02:12:39,270 --> 02:12:44,270
Well let me tell you something,
what we're doing because this is not 

2323
02:12:44,270 --> 02:12:46,811
something we ever set out to do.
When brian and I started this podcast 

2324
02:12:46,811 --> 02:12:48,050
three years ago,
it was just on a laptop in my office and

2325
02:12:48,051 --> 02:12:50,960
we were just trying to have some fun and
we just doing it just to be silly.

2326
02:12:51,230 --> 02:12:56,230
We had done previous things like that,
webcasts where we had done them in hotel

2327
02:12:56,301 --> 02:12:59,090
rooms and you know when we were on the 
road doing stand up,

2328
02:12:59,810 --> 02:13:04,810
but over the course of three years,
one of the things that's happened is 

2329
02:13:04,810 --> 02:13:08,770
people have told us that what they've 
gotten in this podcast and this 

2330
02:13:09,200 --> 02:13:14,200
communication is they've gotten an 
ability to interact or at least here 

2331
02:13:14,200 --> 02:13:16,490
people interact that are like no one 
they know,

2332
02:13:16,700 --> 02:13:17,260
so they're,
they're,

2333
02:13:17,400 --> 02:13:22,400
they're,
they're changing the way they think 

2334
02:13:22,400 --> 02:13:24,281
about life there.
They're seeing that there's other ways 

2335
02:13:24,281 --> 02:13:27,581
to look at things and in fact a lot of 
your reality is shaped by the way you 

2336
02:13:27,581 --> 02:13:31,040
choose to view the world and that you 
can morph that and change that.

2337
02:13:31,050 --> 02:13:33,450
In this podcast,
and again,

2338
02:13:33,451 --> 02:13:36,090
we're not taking credit for it because I
didn't know it was going to happen,

2339
02:13:36,120 --> 02:13:39,360
has had an amazingly profound effect 
effect on people.

2340
02:13:39,510 --> 02:13:44,510
Whereas I've talked to literally 
hundreds of people that say the podcast 

2341
02:13:44,510 --> 02:13:45,780
changed their life and that once they 
started listening,

2342
02:13:45,781 --> 02:13:48,120
they started eating healthier.
Exercising.

2343
02:13:48,270 --> 02:13:50,400
They feel better.
They think about things better.

2344
02:13:50,401 --> 02:13:55,401
They try not to be a shitty person.
They try to be positive and they 

2345
02:13:55,401 --> 02:13:58,050
understand and feel the effect of this 
positive thinking.

2346
02:13:58,100 --> 02:13:58,680
Yeah,
I,

2347
02:13:58,750 --> 02:14:00,480
I agree with you,
and again,

2348
02:14:00,900 --> 02:14:05,900
we're not taking credit for this.
This is something that just happened on 

2349
02:14:05,900 --> 02:14:05,900
its own.
It just,

2350
02:14:05,900 --> 02:14:09,650
is it a side effect of allowing people 
into your life and into your way of 

2351
02:14:09,650 --> 02:14:09,960
thinking,

2352
02:14:11,620 --> 02:14:13,840
openness,
that openness that says that.

2353
02:14:13,860 --> 02:14:14,370
Well,
okay,

2354
02:14:14,371 --> 02:14:16,050
we have this avid.
Yes,

2355
02:14:16,110 --> 02:14:21,110
and let's open it up.
Even though it's only for a couple of 

2356
02:14:21,110 --> 02:14:21,870
hours.
Switch to is that I should really make a

2357
02:14:21,871 --> 02:14:24,570
call to my wife because I told her five.
Five.

2358
02:14:24,650 --> 02:14:29,650
Yeah.
Well we're going to wrap this thing up 

2359
02:14:29,650 --> 02:14:29,650
anyway.
It's 5:30.

2360
02:14:29,650 --> 02:14:29,650
I don't want to wear you out.
Listen,

2361
02:14:29,650 --> 02:14:31,280
this is a.
This is a beautiful conversation.

2362
02:14:31,281 --> 02:14:32,430
Fascinating.
You're,

2363
02:14:32,431 --> 02:14:34,640
you're a very,
a really,

2364
02:14:34,641 --> 02:14:39,641
really interesting and intelligent guy 
and it's hard to follow a lot of what 

2365
02:14:39,641 --> 02:14:39,641
you say.
A two.

2366
02:14:39,641 --> 02:14:41,990
I think a lot of people are gonna.
Listen to this podcast.

2367
02:14:41,991 --> 02:14:42,710
Three or four times.

2368
02:14:42,830 --> 02:14:44,560
I think you did good.
Thank you.

2369
02:14:44,930 --> 02:14:49,930
How,
how the things are actually depends a 

2370
02:14:50,361 --> 02:14:55,361
lot on the language we use and it is the
fact that we have a habit of using 

2371
02:14:55,490 --> 02:15:00,490
languages like mind and consciousness in
an anonymous way that science cannot be 

2372
02:15:01,701 --> 02:15:04,550
done that way.
What happens then is we don't understand

2373
02:15:04,551 --> 02:15:09,551
each other anymore.
So here you are not so much conversant 

2374
02:15:09,551 --> 02:15:13,971
with the new science vocabulary anD here
I am without teaching you any recovery.

2375
02:15:14,500 --> 02:15:19,380
Just get right into the discussion.
And we had a discipline and some words.

2376
02:15:19,690 --> 02:15:24,690
What?
I don't even think it was a dissonance 

2377
02:15:24,690 --> 02:15:24,690
quite honestly.
I think,

2378
02:15:24,690 --> 02:15:25,120
um,
I was just trying to really,

2379
02:15:25,190 --> 02:15:25,880
uh,
ex.

2380
02:15:25,990 --> 02:15:30,990
I was trying to play the part of the 
person that is listening to this for the

2381
02:15:31,301 --> 02:15:33,850
first time.
I'm aware of these concepts of I'm aware

2382
02:15:33,851 --> 02:15:36,400
of your work and I really do appreciate 
you coming on the podcast,

2383
02:15:36,430 --> 02:15:37,990
talk about it,
but it's a,

2384
02:15:38,080 --> 02:15:43,080
even for someone like me who's read at 
least a half a dozen books on this 

2385
02:15:43,080 --> 02:15:43,990
stuff,
it's hard to wrap your head around.

2386
02:15:44,570 --> 02:15:47,500
It is hard and it is also simple,
right?

2387
02:15:47,530 --> 02:15:52,530
I often say that quantum physics is 
simpler than newtonian physics because 

2388
02:15:52,530 --> 02:15:56,351
newtonian physics,
you've got very quickly the idea that 

2389
02:15:56,351 --> 02:15:57,560
science can solve everything and in,
in,

2390
02:15:57,561 --> 02:15:58,100
in,
in,

2391
02:15:58,160 --> 02:16:03,160
in quantum physics,
because the choices brought into for it 

2392
02:16:03,160 --> 02:16:05,790
from the beginning.
ImmeDiately start relating that,

2393
02:16:05,860 --> 02:16:07,330
hey,
I know about choice.

2394
02:16:07,340 --> 02:16:12,340
I know about this stuff.
Is sciences giving us this stuff 

2395
02:16:12,340 --> 02:16:16,420
immediately,
mine mellows out a little and science 

2396
02:16:16,420 --> 02:16:16,420
become more humanistic.

2397
02:16:16,420 --> 02:16:17,980
The last thing I wanted to ask you about
ken.

2398
02:16:18,070 --> 02:16:19,270
Ken,
let you go without this.

2399
02:16:19,390 --> 02:16:21,790
Um,
are you familiar with Dr.

2400
02:16:21,790 --> 02:16:22,990
James Gates?
No,

2401
02:16:23,200 --> 02:16:28,200
he's a theoretical physicist.
I'm a professor of physics at the 

2402
02:16:28,200 --> 02:16:31,900
university of Maryland.
I'm with another guy named john.

2403
02:16:32,050 --> 02:16:35,890
He's the john toll professor of physics 
at the university of Maryland.

2404
02:16:36,160 --> 02:16:41,160
He found self-correcting computer code 
in the equations of string theory.

2405
02:16:43,160 --> 02:16:44,380
Um,
I don't know if you've,

2406
02:16:44,390 --> 02:16:48,220
if you've heard about this.
It was a really interesting,

2407
02:16:48,790 --> 02:16:53,790
again,
really hard to follow conversation that 

2408
02:16:53,790 --> 02:16:56,560
he had with neil degrasse tyson who 
we've had on the show.

2409
02:16:56,561 --> 02:17:01,561
And I talked to neil about it and even 
he was trying to wrap his head around 

2410
02:17:01,561 --> 02:17:02,050
the what,
what this meant,

2411
02:17:02,530 --> 02:17:06,250
but they found double and even self dual
linear,

2412
02:17:06,730 --> 02:17:11,730
excuse me,
doubly even self dual linear binary code

2413
02:17:12,220 --> 02:17:17,220
error correcting block quote,
which was first invented by claude 

2414
02:17:17,220 --> 02:17:21,751
shannon in the 19 forties has been 
discovered and embedded within the 

2415
02:17:21,751 --> 02:17:22,630
equations of superstring theory.
You're laughing at this.

2416
02:17:22,631 --> 02:17:24,240
It's almost like you.

2417
02:17:24,320 --> 02:17:27,170
No,
I'm laughing because here we are talking

2418
02:17:27,171 --> 02:17:29,920
mainly about quantum physics and 
consciousness sedentary.

2419
02:17:29,950 --> 02:17:34,250
You go into such a sophisticated 
discussion of something that is remotely

2420
02:17:34,251 --> 02:17:35,930
connected with quantum physics of 
course.

2421
02:17:37,600 --> 02:17:38,960
But um,
you know,

2422
02:17:39,350 --> 02:17:41,750
it could very well be,
but I'll tell you something,

2423
02:17:41,850 --> 02:17:46,460
they lost interest in such details.
this is fairly simple.

2424
02:17:47,180 --> 02:17:52,180
String theory is a good example of what 
the idea that people propose when they 

2425
02:17:52,641 --> 02:17:57,641
say the word pseudoscience.
Pseudoscience field of sciences that 

2426
02:17:57,641 --> 02:18:01,210
were theory and experiment are both not 
physical aspects.

2427
02:18:01,490 --> 02:18:06,490
It's just to re.
This is a good example of just theory 

2428
02:18:06,490 --> 02:18:08,900
because string theory can never be very 
far in our experience.

2429
02:18:08,930 --> 02:18:13,930
We just cannot do it.
It's talking about too high and energy 

2430
02:18:13,930 --> 02:18:17,930
that we cannot simulate in the quiet,
in the laboratory,

2431
02:18:17,960 --> 02:18:22,340
nor in the high energy cosmology.
So in other words,

2432
02:18:22,360 --> 02:18:24,200
it's really a very,
very,

2433
02:18:24,230 --> 02:18:24,830
very,
very,

2434
02:18:24,840 --> 02:18:26,120
very,
very far out.

2435
02:18:26,600 --> 02:18:31,250
So you know,
here we are at once the rational culture

2436
02:18:31,251 --> 02:18:36,251
that we call scientific materialism 
that's intended date to talk about a 

2437
02:18:37,160 --> 02:18:42,160
string theory,
which is highly abstract mathematical 

2438
02:18:42,160 --> 02:18:44,970
theory,
not that they're not interesting as a 

2439
02:18:44,970 --> 02:18:44,970
mind game,
certainly interesting.

2440
02:18:45,500 --> 02:18:49,190
And then they'll object things like 
telepathy,

2441
02:18:49,191 --> 02:18:54,110
which is very much human.
Where the objection of course is that it

2442
02:18:54,111 --> 02:18:59,111
may not be quiet our proper science 
because there may not be in a good 

2443
02:18:59,111 --> 02:19:00,500
theory.
There may not be any good data.

2444
02:19:01,130 --> 02:19:02,810
so it was very strange.
We,

2445
02:19:02,840 --> 02:19:06,350
we,
we do because it has mathematics in it.

2446
02:19:06,920 --> 02:19:09,950
We call science,
which cannot be ever be verified.

2447
02:19:10,400 --> 02:19:12,440
Quite doable.
science

2448
02:19:13,040 --> 02:19:15,980
be science if it's not verified,
but it yet it's mathematic.

2449
02:19:16,010 --> 02:19:16,560
If it's math,

2450
02:19:17,690 --> 02:19:20,690
I agree you agree with me,
but say this is what puzzles me,

2451
02:19:20,700 --> 02:19:25,700
that,
that the culture is so obtuse that they 

2452
02:19:25,700 --> 02:19:26,450
don't have,
they will never collect.

2453
02:19:27,430 --> 02:19:29,600
There are many concepts like that.
You know,

2454
02:19:30,050 --> 02:19:32,870
which because of that mathematical 
nature,

2455
02:19:33,350 --> 02:19:37,790
they're accepted part of science because
their mathematical,

2456
02:19:37,850 --> 02:19:41,360
because mathematics is so vital,
it just felt

2457
02:19:41,710 --> 02:19:46,710
so.
You're not interested in this because 

2458
02:19:46,710 --> 02:19:48,721
there's literally no way to know whether
it's correct or whether it's just 

2459
02:19:48,721 --> 02:19:48,721
daydreaming,
right?

2460
02:19:48,721 --> 02:19:49,860
So I have a crazy way to make a living

2461
02:19:50,770 --> 02:19:53,640
vaguely interested because the one thing
there is something good,

2462
02:19:53,670 --> 02:19:58,670
very good about theory because it does 
enable us to connect gravity to quantum 

2463
02:19:59,130 --> 02:20:03,090
physics and that that problem is not to 
be underestimated,

2464
02:20:03,480 --> 02:20:08,480
but I don't want the solution to come in
the form of a theory that can never be 

2465
02:20:08,480 --> 02:20:08,490
very far.
Right?

2466
02:20:08,610 --> 02:20:12,510
So people should recognize that science 
has two prongs.

2467
02:20:12,540 --> 02:20:13,840
In fact,
in my judgment,

2468
02:20:13,841 --> 02:20:17,120
tree theory,
edification,

2469
02:20:17,190 --> 02:20:19,080
experiment,
and then technology,

2470
02:20:19,840 --> 02:20:24,840
there's never going to be any 
technological application of something 

2471
02:20:24,840 --> 02:20:25,620
like string theory.
Never,

2472
02:20:26,070 --> 02:20:29,160
never.
IT's just too abstract.

2473
02:20:29,610 --> 02:20:34,610
Taking place in places that are so 
remote from the human experience that 

2474
02:20:37,350 --> 02:20:42,350
technology,
technological breakthroughs on the face 

2475
02:20:42,350 --> 02:20:42,840
of it is,
you know,

2476
02:20:42,900 --> 02:20:47,900
at least for high energy physics,
you could always give it technological 

2477
02:20:47,900 --> 02:20:50,700
justifications for in the form of 
weapons technology.

2478
02:20:51,240 --> 02:20:56,240
Not particularly good,
but why technology at least is that 

2479
02:20:56,240 --> 02:20:56,730
feasible offshoot of high energy 
physics,

2480
02:20:57,270 --> 02:21:00,740
but these kinds of stuff,
you know,

2481
02:21:00,800 --> 02:21:01,240
it,
it,

2482
02:21:01,530 --> 02:21:06,530
it,
it's just been too far from my for my 

2483
02:21:06,530 --> 02:21:09,831
taste.
We should concentrate instead of 

2484
02:21:09,831 --> 02:21:10,980
problems which can immediately be 
addressed,

2485
02:21:11,220 --> 02:21:14,550
problems that has impact on who we are,
what we are,

2486
02:21:14,551 --> 02:21:19,551
what we are doing here,
give us answers to real life questions 

2487
02:21:19,551 --> 02:21:20,940
like how to run our life,
how to run our society,

2488
02:21:20,941 --> 02:21:25,650
how to run our economy,
and we have designs at hand.

2489
02:21:25,651 --> 02:21:27,540
That's what the New science is trying to
do.

2490
02:21:28,260 --> 02:21:33,260
Instead we have too much emphasis on 
things that have not much to do with us.

2491
02:21:39,240 --> 02:21:42,930
The human condition superstring theory,
like super string theory.

2492
02:21:43,360 --> 02:21:43,970
Yeah,
I,

2493
02:21:44,020 --> 02:21:49,020
I've never been able to understand that 
and I'm glad that you couldn't 

2494
02:21:49,020 --> 02:21:49,770
understand it either or that it can't be
understood or that it leads to camp

2495
02:21:49,870 --> 02:21:52,420
verify,
but it doesn't need to be.

2496
02:21:52,570 --> 02:21:55,480
It doesn't need to be understood because
it can be very far.

2497
02:21:55,930 --> 02:21:59,080
That's my simple proposition.
Who needs to understand things,

2498
02:21:59,110 --> 02:22:04,110
clutter up your rein up for things which
has no consequence in my life,

2499
02:22:04,450 --> 02:22:07,000
and cannot even be very fair and can 
never be built.

2500
02:22:07,330 --> 02:22:09,860
Never give rise to any technology that I
can relate.

2501
02:22:10,180 --> 02:22:12,340
There's so much crazy shit to 
concentrate on.

2502
02:22:12,341 --> 02:22:13,840
That is actually real.
Right on.

2503
02:22:14,440 --> 02:22:16,510
Thank you sir.
It's been an honor to talk to you.

2504
02:22:16,511 --> 02:22:17,860
I really,
truly appreciate it.

2505
02:22:17,880 --> 02:22:19,240
Um,
what could people with.

2506
02:22:19,480 --> 02:22:24,480
What books do you have out that you 
recommend that people could pick up to 

2507
02:22:24,480 --> 02:22:25,980
learn more about,
about some of your

2508
02:22:25,980 --> 02:22:30,980
work when they basic quantum physics 
stuff is best done in a book called the 

2509
02:22:31,390 --> 02:22:33,650
universe.
God is not dead is another one.

2510
02:22:33,730 --> 02:22:38,730
God is not dead is another one.
And how quantum activism concepts 

2511
02:22:38,730 --> 02:22:41,910
civilization has some of the 
consequences of this theory to society.

2512
02:22:41,960 --> 02:22:44,010
do you have a twitter page?
Yeah,

2513
02:22:44,050 --> 02:22:46,480
of course you do.
Yes,

2514
02:22:47,210 --> 02:22:50,220
I didn't find it.
I'm gonna.

2515
02:22:50,380 --> 02:22:55,380
Go swami.
See you're funny on twitter here.

2516
02:22:56,030 --> 02:22:58,580
So I could send people to it.
Um,

2517
02:22:59,570 --> 02:23:00,970
yes.
Um,

2518
02:23:01,250 --> 02:23:02,270
nope.
That's not you.

2519
02:23:02,340 --> 02:23:07,340
It was some crazy.
Dude is laid here is love but innocent 

2520
02:23:07,340 --> 02:23:07,760
here is knowledge.
But creative,

2521
02:23:07,790 --> 02:23:09,210
here's life,
but that's not you.

2522
02:23:09,211 --> 02:23:10,160
Right?
That's whack.

2523
02:23:10,200 --> 02:23:14,970
You wouldn't write something that whack.
Who is that guy catches me?

2524
02:23:15,620 --> 02:23:20,270
Is that you will find you.
Do you.

2525
02:23:20,300 --> 02:23:25,300
Do you know what your twitter name is?
You don't know what it is and no to 

2526
02:23:25,300 --> 02:23:26,360
someone else do it for you.
Yeah.

2527
02:23:27,010 --> 02:23:28,340
Hmm.
That's ridiculous.

2528
02:23:29,540 --> 02:23:31,250
There's a lot of young there.
Unfortunately.

2529
02:23:31,251 --> 02:23:35,240
There's a lot of goswamis a shorten via 
a whole lot.

2530
02:23:36,140 --> 02:23:41,140
How many?
There's a bunch of different ones on 

2531
02:23:41,140 --> 02:23:41,140
twitter,
belieVe it or not.

2532
02:23:41,140 --> 02:23:42,350
yeah.
You've probably got a lot of fakers.

2533
02:23:42,560 --> 02:23:44,250
There's dudes who were,
you know,

2534
02:23:44,560 --> 02:23:45,920
what did you say?
No,

2535
02:23:45,921 --> 02:23:48,170
but I'm telling you there's a lot of 
fakers out there.

2536
02:23:48,190 --> 02:23:48,440
Huh?

2537
02:23:48,480 --> 02:23:52,920
Can I ask a quick question on the,
on you said earlier in the podcast that,

2538
02:23:52,921 --> 02:23:55,530
you know now because of lasers and stuff
like that,

2539
02:23:55,531 --> 02:24:00,531
you can measure particles a lot more 
accurately and that's how you found 

2540
02:24:00,531 --> 02:24:00,810
that,
you know,

2541
02:24:01,080 --> 02:24:03,360
particles actually are moving.
Do you,

2542
02:24:03,361 --> 02:24:05,990
is the laser itself,
uh,

2543
02:24:06,030 --> 02:24:09,150
is that an accurate tool?
Has that been proven to be 100 percent?

2544
02:24:09,151 --> 02:24:10,740
Because what if it was just,
you know,

2545
02:24:10,741 --> 02:24:12,750
the laser saying that,
but then down,

2546
02:24:12,751 --> 02:24:14,250
you know,
20 years from now you find out,

2547
02:24:14,280 --> 02:24:15,360
oh,
it was just the laser.

2548
02:24:15,560 --> 02:24:15,980
NO,
no,

2549
02:24:16,100 --> 02:24:18,590
no,
no measurement of distance.

2550
02:24:18,860 --> 02:24:23,860
So I'm part of macro object like a,
we're talking about tables and chairs at

2551
02:24:24,531 --> 02:24:28,370
that time in between,
you're looking at my looking.

2552
02:24:28,430 --> 02:24:33,430
They moved so very little and it's very 
hard to observe with just ordinary way 

2553
02:24:34,251 --> 02:24:36,770
that we measured like triangulating and 
all that.

2554
02:24:37,130 --> 02:24:41,740
But with the laser beam,
because lasers traveling fairly,

2555
02:24:41,760 --> 02:24:45,810
very close to a straight line,
the diffraction effect is actually gone.

2556
02:24:46,670 --> 02:24:51,670
Very good straight lines.
So triangulation becomes very accurate 

2557
02:24:51,670 --> 02:24:54,710
because you really can go a long 
distance and even that small of a,

2558
02:24:54,840 --> 02:24:59,840
even that,
even that small measurement do contract 

2559
02:24:59,840 --> 02:24:59,840
for measuring.

2560
02:24:59,840 --> 02:25:04,460
I found you on twitter.
Your twitter handle is quantum 

2561
02:25:04,460 --> 02:25:05,520
activists,
quantum activist on twitter.

2562
02:25:05,610 --> 02:25:08,250
So ladies and gentlemen,
please follow him on twitter.

2563

We'd love to talk to you more.
it's a real pleasure.

2572
02:25:26,190 --> 02:25:27,760
have leftover.
Thank you.

2573
02:25:27,780 --> 02:25:29,380
Uh,

2575
02:25:34,381 --> 02:25:38,041
days off of audible,

2576
02:25:38,741 --> 02:25:42,040
like audio books and podcasts and comedy
albums.

2577
02:25:42,041 --> 02:25:45,040
It's a beautiful company.
And uh,

2578
02:25:45,041 --> 02:25:50,041
they uh,
had been supporting this podcast for 

2579
02:25:50,041 --> 02:25:50,041
awhile,
so we appreciate them very much.

2580
02:25:50,041 --> 02:25:51,820
A audible.com/joe.
Go there.

2581
02:25:51,970 --> 02:25:56,970
Get yourself a free audio book.
Is any of her books on available on 

2582
02:25:56,970 --> 02:25:56,970
audio book?

2583
02:25:56,970 --> 02:26:00,020
Um,
I don't think that they're all available

2584
02:26:00,050 --> 02:26:02,360
as ebooks and kindle.
Oh,

2585
02:26:02,361 --> 02:26:07,361
they are.
But nobody's done an audio version of 

2586
02:26:07,361 --> 02:26:09,671
it.
I don't think anybody has done an audio 

2587
02:26:09,671 --> 02:26:09,671
version.
In fact,

2588
02:26:09,671 --> 02:26:10,340
if you can inspire some of these people 
to do it,

2589
02:26:10,341 --> 02:26:13,160
I'd love it.
I'm sure they would love to do,

2590
02:26:13,180 --> 02:26:14,600
do they?
it's on amazon.

2591
02:26:14,660 --> 02:26:17,870
Um,
see if there's an audio version of it.

2592
02:26:21,160 --> 02:26:22,010
Yeah.
I'm sorry.

2593
02:26:22,011 --> 02:26:23,320
That's an inside joke.
Thank you sir.

Ian edwards.
Right.

What is your posture is sessions.
by the way,

2625
02:27:58,801 --> 02:28:01,670
he was on conan wednesday,
so I go to a conan's,

2626
02:28:01,671 --> 02:28:03,870
a website and check has set out 
wednesday.

2627
02:28:03,900 --> 02:28:04,670
Beautiful.
Really good.

2628
02:28:05,160 --> 02:28:10,160
All right folks.
We got a hell of a week coming next 

2629
02:28:10,160 --> 02:28:10,490
week.
This podcast keeps rolling.

2630
02:28:10,510 --> 02:28:12,710
You dirty bitches.
We stopped for no man.

2631
02:28:13,520 --> 02:28:16,040
We stopped for no quantum theory.
We got monday.

2632
02:28:16,041 --> 02:28:18,260
We've got bas rooted in the fucking 
house.

2633
02:28:18,460 --> 02:28:22,280
A tuesday.
Scott sigler who is a horror author,

2634
02:28:22,281 --> 02:28:24,530
and then we're working on someone 
wednesday.

2635
02:28:24,710 --> 02:28:27,440
hopefully I'm going to be able to get a 
justin wren.

2636
02:28:27,620 --> 02:28:31,490
He's the white guy that's been working 
to save the pygmies in africa.

2637
02:28:31,491 --> 02:28:34,550
I don't know if you see the video of the
first time they ever saw a white guy and

2638
02:28:34,551 --> 02:28:39,551
it touched me.
It was a former mma fighter who's now 

2639
02:28:39,551 --> 02:28:41,440
living in the Congo trying to help 
pygmies fake photos.

2640
02:28:41,450 --> 02:28:43,010
I heard this over fake photos.
Oh no,

2641
02:28:43,011 --> 02:28:48,011
this isn't a really recent.
I think you're thinking of something 

2642
02:28:48,011 --> 02:28:48,011
different.
Yeah,

2643
02:28:48,011 --> 02:28:48,011
it wasn't a photo.
It was a video and it was like staged.

2644
02:28:48,011 --> 02:28:52,961
Apparently this is not.
This is modern iphone footage of him in 

2645
02:28:52,961 --> 02:28:54,190
the Congo meeting.
These pygmies and the little boys,

2646
02:28:54,191 --> 02:28:56,330
the little kids like they had never seen
a white guy before.

2647
02:28:56,760 --> 02:29:01,010
A alright you fox.
We love the shit out of here and keep it

2648
02:29:01,011 --> 02:29:02,720
together,
bitches and we'll see on monday.
