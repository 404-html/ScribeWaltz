1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:00,863
And Five.

2
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:01,450
Okay.

3
00:00:01,450 --> 00:00:02,260
Four,

4
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:03,100
three,

5
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:04,173
two.

6
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:05,380
One

7
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:10,450
has it hanging up on me.

8
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:12,690
Will live live.

9
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:14,223
Dr Phil.

10
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:15,460
Well live.

11
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:16,211
Someone's calling you.

12
00:00:16,211 --> 00:00:17,044
What's going on

13
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:17,821
those people,

14
00:00:17,821 --> 00:00:20,830
some of those people I
was trying to find said,

15
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:21,733
oh shit,

16
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:28,640
let them worry out of all the years
you've been doing your show and all the

17
00:00:28,641 --> 00:00:29,870
years you've been given advice.

18
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:31,220
Hi,

19
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:32,053
how did this

20
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:33,590
catch me outside?

21
00:00:33,591 --> 00:00:34,160
Girl,

22
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:34,993
how did this happen?

23
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:42,200
All the know all the different shows.

24
00:00:42,201 --> 00:00:43,250
If you made a monster,

25
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:44,330
I know,

26
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:46,700
I mean it's my moment of infamy.

27
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:48,471
No,

28
00:00:48,471 --> 00:00:48,951
seriously.

29
00:00:48,951 --> 00:00:53,120
This girl comes home with her mother and
her mother actually brings her own of

30
00:00:53,121 --> 00:00:53,421
course,

31
00:00:53,421 --> 00:00:58,421
and if she's a train wreck and we work
with her and we send her to this ranch

32
00:01:00,051 --> 00:01:01,160
for like four months,

33
00:01:01,161 --> 00:01:01,994
right?

34
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:07,040
She goes for a long time and
makes a complete turnaround,

35
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:08,840
does a really a great job.

36
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:11,690
They say she's become a leader.

37
00:01:11,691 --> 00:01:16,691
She's working with all these girls doing
a great job and then she graduates and

38
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:20,750
I remember this last shot and we do this,

39
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:23,240
this piece at the ranch.

40
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,580
She jumps up on this fence and is
smiling and everything and waving at all.

41
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:34,300
One night home with her mother one night
and her mother's finding people that

42
00:01:35,181 --> 00:01:36,260
are trashing her,

43
00:01:36,261 --> 00:01:37,430
the mother on,

44
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:37,911
on,

45
00:01:37,911 --> 00:01:38,360
uh,

46
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:41,750
the social media platforms
or mother tracks him down,

47
00:01:41,751 --> 00:01:42,950
backs into who they are,

48
00:01:42,951 --> 00:01:44,210
gets their phone numbers,

49
00:01:44,211 --> 00:01:45,080
calls him up,

50
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:47,180
yelling into the phone,

51
00:01:47,181 --> 00:01:48,800
calling them names and stuff,

52
00:01:48,801 --> 00:01:52,610
gets the daughter involved
one night crashes.

53
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,400
So they come back for a followup like,

54
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,181
I don't know,

55
00:01:56,181 --> 00:01:57,230
month or two later.

56
00:01:57,950 --> 00:01:59,750
And when they come I say,

57
00:01:59,751 --> 00:02:00,560
okay,

58
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,393
we're going to have him back.

59
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:02,930
They walk out,

60
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:05,360
I have the audience completely empty.

61
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:07,820
I have nobody there to play too.

62
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:08,600
I mean,

63
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,710
250 chairs,

64
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:10,340
empty,

65
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:11,810
nobody in the house but me,

66
00:02:11,811 --> 00:02:12,860
the mother and the daughter,

67
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:13,753
that's a good move.

68
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:14,960
And they go,

69
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:16,310
whoa,

70
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:18,320
where is everybody's?

71
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:18,531
Well,

72
00:02:18,531 --> 00:02:19,400
you don't need anybody,

73
00:02:19,401 --> 00:02:21,380
we're just here to talk and you know,

74
00:02:21,381 --> 00:02:22,250
keep things rolling.

75
00:02:22,251 --> 00:02:23,084
Right.

76
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:24,240
And they were dumbstruck,

77
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:24,560
they,

78
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,280
there was nobody there to
showboat for or play too.

79
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:30,050
And there was like a 15 minute interview.

80
00:02:30,051 --> 00:02:31,070
They had nothing to say.

81
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:33,110
And off they go.

82
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:38,111
And then this phrase
that got turned into a,

83
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:39,470
you know,

84
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:39,861
whatever,

85
00:02:39,861 --> 00:02:41,150
a meme or whatever they call it,

86
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:42,793
um,

87
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,840
it just went crazy.

88
00:02:44,841 --> 00:02:49,841
And what she was nominated
for a grammy or Siri.

89
00:02:49,981 --> 00:02:51,330
I'm serious.

90
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,220
Uh,

91
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,920
I take no credit or blame.

92
00:02:57,930 --> 00:02:58,181
I,

93
00:02:58,181 --> 00:02:58,701
you know,

94
00:02:58,701 --> 00:02:59,260
I just,

95
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,820
what I could and haven't seen her since.

96
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:01,750
I wish everybody,

97
00:03:01,751 --> 00:03:02,021
well,

98
00:03:02,021 --> 00:03:02,950
maybe she'll turn,

99
00:03:02,951 --> 00:03:04,390
so maybe it'll grow her up.

100
00:03:04,391 --> 00:03:05,600
She'll turn some posse valve.

101
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:06,250
But I hope so.

102
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:06,401
Well,

103
00:03:06,401 --> 00:03:06,860
that's

104
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:08,690
good attitude and very
healthy attitude for you.

105
00:03:08,691 --> 00:03:09,524
But it is,

106
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:11,780
when something goes viral like that,

107
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:15,440
something's strange that for whatever
reason it catches and takes off.

108
00:03:15,441 --> 00:03:16,274
It's,

109
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:17,720
it doesn't make any sense.

110
00:03:17,721 --> 00:03:18,830
It's a very weird thing.

111
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:19,910
It makes no sense.

112
00:03:19,911 --> 00:03:21,530
She's on a billboard on sunset,

113
00:03:21,531 --> 00:03:22,730
a giant billboard.

114
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:23,690
Oh really?

115
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:24,523
Huge.

116
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:25,970
Enormous billboard.

117
00:03:25,971 --> 00:03:28,830
It's like one of those side of the
building billboards where they,

118
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:29,271
you know,

119
00:03:29,271 --> 00:03:32,150
they put the graphic up and
covers the entire building.

120
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,650
It makes no sense.

121
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:36,450
Seriously.

122
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,240
Seriously.

123
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:40,020
There's people curing cancer and
you can't find them with both hands.

124
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:40,950
Exactly.

125
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:44,280
Nobody has any idea who won the
last Nobel Prize for science,

126
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:45,933
but you know,

127
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,460
more power to her.

128
00:03:47,461 --> 00:03:50,370
I if if she can turn
into something positive,

129
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:51,751
she have talent.

130
00:03:51,751 --> 00:03:53,280
Have you ever heard any of her music now?

131
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:54,140
I have no idea.

132
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:56,120
I've either seen her on your show.

133
00:03:57,330 --> 00:03:58,460
I appreciate you bringing that up.

134
00:03:58,850 --> 00:03:59,683
Sorry.

135
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:06,110
But it's just so strange that one
train wreck could for whatever reason,

136
00:04:06,651 --> 00:04:09,920
catch on and then all of
a sudden it's gigantic.

137
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:10,121
Yeah.

138
00:04:10,121 --> 00:04:13,450
They say that somebody signed her
and paid her millions of dollars.

139
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:14,343
Seriously

140
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:17,730
close to a million dollars
from a makeup company.

141
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:19,470
Really?

142
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:19,950
Yeah.

143
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:20,191
Oh,

144
00:04:20,191 --> 00:04:20,610
well,

145
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:21,000
okay.

146
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,833
There you go.

147
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:22,560
I mean,

148
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,520
if that's happening,

149
00:04:23,521 --> 00:04:23,821
right,

150
00:04:23,821 --> 00:04:25,800
like what would your advice be then?

151
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:26,970
Would your advice be,

152
00:04:26,971 --> 00:04:27,540
Hey,

153
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:30,600
get your shit together
and stop being crazy?

154
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:31,200
Well,

155
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:35,730
she's making a lot of money off of being
crazy and her opportunities before that

156
00:04:35,731 --> 00:04:37,230
were probably severely limited.

157
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:37,671
Well,

158
00:04:37,671 --> 00:04:38,480
they had to be.

159
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:41,210
And what I hope now that this,

160
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:44,540
even though this certainly is a quirk,

161
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:50,050
what I hope now is that she's surrounded
by mature people with business heads on

162
00:04:51,411 --> 00:04:56,411
their shoulders and development people
that will actually guide this in a way

163
00:04:56,571 --> 00:04:57,950
that it's not 15 minutes.

164
00:04:58,540 --> 00:04:59,370
Yeah.

165
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:00,280
You never know.

166
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:00,680
You know?

167
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,450
That's what I hope.

168
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:04,330
Well everybody thought the Kardashians
are going to be 15 minutes and it's been

169
00:05:04,331 --> 00:05:05,200
15 years.

170
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:06,103
Yeah.

171
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:07,250
But there's been,

172
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:08,203
you know,

173
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:13,330
people make fun of them and there's
some good things there to make fun of.

174
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:15,260
They do things to be made fun of.

175
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:19,850
But there's also from very smart business
and branding that's gone into that as

176
00:05:19,851 --> 00:05:20,220
well.

177
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:20,371
Oh,

178
00:05:20,371 --> 00:05:20,881
100%.

179
00:05:20,881 --> 00:05:21,421
And you know,

180
00:05:21,421 --> 00:05:24,540
and I was actually very impressed with
her that she actually went to the White

181
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:26,100
House to talk about prison reform.

182
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:26,430
Right.

183
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:30,840
For people that are unjustly accused and
are being been in jail for too long for

184
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:33,000
things that they didn't do.

185
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:35,070
And that's something she's
actually passionate about.

186
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:35,450
Yeah.

187
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:38,960
And I know Kim and she's
actually a very nice girl,

188
00:05:38,961 --> 00:05:40,550
very smart and all.

189
00:05:40,551 --> 00:05:41,141
And you know,

190
00:05:41,141 --> 00:05:41,390
they,

191
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:41,931
as I say,

192
00:05:41,931 --> 00:05:45,380
they've done some very brilliant
branding and it's certainly paid off.

193
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:48,580
It's just so fascinating when
something catches like that girl,

194
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,570
what is her name?

195
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:50,403
The catch me outside,

196
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,050
uh,

197
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:53,900
Danielle goalie or something.

198
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:54,743
Yeah.

199
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:55,580
Yeah.

200
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:58,370
Cause I didn't know her as
the catch me outside girl.

201
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:01,730
But if she didn't say that one phrase.

202
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,030
Yeah.

203
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:07,580
And she just said that I think to her
grandmother or somebody in the audience,

204
00:06:07,581 --> 00:06:10,430
I know it didn't even
register with us at the time.

205
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:11,293
Wow.

206
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,170
It was,

207
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:15,590
it wasn't a standout phrase
in the interview or anything.

208
00:06:15,591 --> 00:06:16,580
It just pass by.

209
00:06:16,581 --> 00:06:17,720
Somebody just grabbed it and,

210
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:19,040
and then it became a meme.

211
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:19,963
Yeah.

212
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:22,490
What a weird world we live in.

213
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:22,851
Yeah,

214
00:06:22,851 --> 00:06:23,684
no kidding.

215
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:30,160
I mean it has to be a lot
of responsibility to try to
give people advice and try

216
00:06:30,561 --> 00:06:33,430
to straighten her life
out and show them the,

217
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:36,350
the flaws and the errors
that they're making.

218
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:36,921
Yeah,

219
00:06:36,921 --> 00:06:37,754
it is.

220
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,001
And you know,

221
00:06:38,001 --> 00:06:39,620
people ask me sometimes they say,

222
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:40,310
you know,

223
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:43,130
doc field or problems,

224
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:45,830
you think problems are as simple
as you make them out to be.

225
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,840
And the truth is,

226
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,790
I don't think problems are simple at all.

227
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:50,781
In fact,

228
00:06:50,781 --> 00:06:52,280
I think problems are really,

229
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:53,810
most of the time,

230
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:54,800
pretty complex.

231
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:55,783
They're pretty layered.

232
00:06:56,690 --> 00:07:01,400
They have a lot of different origins
and they're oftentimes Comorbid.

233
00:07:01,401 --> 00:07:02,750
A lot of things exist together.

234
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:06,020
So I don't think problems
are simple at all,

235
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:08,390
but to solutions are often simple.

236
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:09,081
Don't you think?

237
00:07:09,081 --> 00:07:11,930
I mean it's Kinda like the old joke.

238
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:14,660
You go the doctor and you say this hurts.

239
00:07:14,661 --> 00:07:14,961
And he says,

240
00:07:14,961 --> 00:07:16,190
well then don't do that anymore.

241
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:20,330
It's a lot of times
it's very simple in it.

242
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:25,820
Somebody will have a complex thing that
comes from childhood or maybe it's a

243
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:28,310
drug background or they've
had trauma in their life.

244
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:32,120
But the solution is change your behavior.

245
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:32,631
I mean,

246
00:07:32,631 --> 00:07:34,730
stop rewarding bad behavior.

247
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:35,540
Uh,

248
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:37,400
choose a different path in life.

249
00:07:37,401 --> 00:07:39,470
Just behave your way to success.

250
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:41,870
Sometimes the solutions are very simple,

251
00:07:41,871 --> 00:07:46,190
even though the problems are very complex
because at some point you have to stop

252
00:07:46,191 --> 00:07:47,000
focus econ.

253
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:47,630
Why?

254
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:50,300
And start focusing on what
instead of why it happened,

255
00:07:50,301 --> 00:07:51,650
what am I going to do to change it?

256
00:07:51,651 --> 00:07:53,780
So sometimes the solutions
are pretty simple,

257
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:56,700
but implementing those
solutions are often very,

258
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:59,150
it's often very difficult for
people to change their lives,

259
00:07:59,151 --> 00:08:00,200
change their patterns.

260
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:00,860
It is.

261
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:01,693
And,

262
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,530
and patterns is the key.

263
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:04,813
Um,

264
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:05,151
you know,

265
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:08,360
nobody does anything in pattern
if they don't get a pay off.

266
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:11,330
And if you can identify,

267
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,560
that's why.

268
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,930
That's why insights so important.

269
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:19,100
That's why I think it's the number one
outcome to whether somebody is going to

270
00:08:19,101 --> 00:08:21,200
respond to a talking therapy.

271
00:08:21,201 --> 00:08:22,034
For example,

272
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,820
if somebody can identify
what their payoff is,

273
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,550
where they really can figure out,

274
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:34,270
I'm doing this repeatedly and my
payoff is I don't have to work,

275
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,980
or I don't get held accountable for this,

276
00:08:36,981 --> 00:08:40,460
or I'm escaping accountability over here,

277
00:08:40,461 --> 00:08:42,560
or I get attention or sympathy,

278
00:08:42,561 --> 00:08:44,330
or if they can figure
out what their payoff is

279
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,870
and they can then control that,

280
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:49,880
whether it's for themselves
or their kids or whatever.

281
00:08:49,881 --> 00:08:51,230
If you control the currency,

282
00:08:51,231 --> 00:08:52,670
then you can control the behavior.

283
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:54,290
Yeah,

284
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:54,710
it's,

285
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:56,370
it just seems that people

286
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:57,240
have a,

287
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:02,340
they have this comfort in their patterns
and even if their patents are self

288
00:09:02,341 --> 00:09:02,851
destructive,

289
00:09:02,851 --> 00:09:05,910
he had been his drug abuse
or alcoholism or did those,

290
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:06,540
those,

291
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:09,660
the comfort in those patterns
falling into those patterns.

292
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,100
It seems very compelling to a lot of
people and payoffs don't necessarily mean

293
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,720
that it's a positive payoff.

294
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:16,480
Right?

295
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,050
I mean,

296
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:19,120
it pay off for taking
heroin as you get high.

297
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,430
And so you're high for a while.

298
00:09:21,431 --> 00:09:22,780
That's not a positive pay off,

299
00:09:22,781 --> 00:09:23,710
but it's a payoff.

300
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,270
Right?

301
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:25,690
And if you,

302
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,760
if you get high and so you don't get a
job and you don't take care of your kids,

303
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,890
that's a payoff.

304
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,040
That you're not doing
things that you need to do,

305
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,630
that you should be accountable for.

306
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:39,650
It's a pathological payoff,

307
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:40,451
but it's a pay off.

308
00:09:40,451 --> 00:09:41,290
None the less.

309
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:43,810
And so that does reward you,

310
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:46,170
even though it's a pathological payoff.

311
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:47,650
It's a pathological thing.

312
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:48,430
Uh,

313
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:51,730
you call it a reward and if you,

314
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,530
but if you can identify
that where they say,

315
00:09:53,531 --> 00:09:53,800
look,

316
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,460
I'm,

317
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:54,920
uh,

318
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:59,050
I'm not doing what I need to do and I
need to stop rewarding myself in that way

319
00:09:59,051 --> 00:10:00,070
and hold myself,

320
00:10:00,071 --> 00:10:01,360
kind of need to be there for my kid.

321
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:05,860
I tell my kid I'm going to be there
every day and I don't show up because I'm

322
00:10:05,861 --> 00:10:06,730
high on drugs,

323
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,593
then you know,

324
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:08,760
I need to stop doing.

325
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:13,780
I don't need to not let myself get away
with that and instead require myself to

326
00:10:14,771 --> 00:10:16,000
show up for the kid.

327
00:10:16,001 --> 00:10:18,310
When I say I do say I will,

328
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:21,730
and then you see what's in the kid's eyes.

329
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:23,680
You share the experience with them.

330
00:10:23,681 --> 00:10:24,870
Now that becomes your payoff,

331
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:26,500
so then you'll start
showing it for your kids.

332
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,470
Yeah.

333
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:27,801
How,

334
00:10:27,801 --> 00:10:29,420
how many people take your advice?

335
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:32,570
How many people just listened and
try for a little bit and then bail?

336
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:34,453
You know,

337
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,420
it's hard to say because I think our,

338
00:10:38,421 --> 00:10:43,421
sometimes our most productive guest are
the ones that don't get it because the

339
00:10:45,861 --> 00:10:46,970
mail we get,

340
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:48,253
they'll say,

341
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:49,183
oh wow,

342
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:50,600
that guy didn't get her to,

343
00:10:50,601 --> 00:10:51,680
that woman didn't get it,

344
00:10:51,681 --> 00:10:56,681
but I saw myself in them and
I'll never say that again.

345
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:02,620
I saw them being such a right fighter
or I saw them being so hard headed or so

346
00:11:04,221 --> 00:11:09,221
oppositional and I s I heard them say
things I've said and they laughed and

347
00:11:11,331 --> 00:11:12,164
didn't get it.

348
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,730
I got it on.

349
00:11:13,731 --> 00:11:14,960
Never do that again.

350
00:11:14,961 --> 00:11:19,961
So sometimes those that don't get it
at all while they're there are the ones

351
00:11:20,271 --> 00:11:23,000
that are the best teaching tools for
the millions of people that are home

352
00:11:23,001 --> 00:11:23,600
watching.

353
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:23,931
Yeah.

354
00:11:23,931 --> 00:11:24,651
That's interesting,

355
00:11:24,651 --> 00:11:25,041
isn't it?

356
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:26,600
When you watch people fail and you go,

357
00:11:26,601 --> 00:11:27,141
oh,

358
00:11:27,141 --> 00:11:27,650
okay,

359
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:29,030
I see that in myself.

360
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:29,480
Yeah,

361
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,130
I just got to not do with that guys do it.

362
00:11:31,131 --> 00:11:34,640
And then also do you see the stubborn
pigheadedness that some people have what?

363
00:11:34,641 --> 00:11:39,560
They won't listen to advice and you could
clearly see how they're ruining their

364
00:11:39,561 --> 00:11:41,660
lives by not being honest.

365
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,980
And sometimes the story that we might
have is maybe extreme where you say,

366
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,410
I don't do all six things they're doing,

367
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:53,620
but I do two of them and they
are in sharp relief to me.

368
00:11:53,621 --> 00:11:54,730
So I get that.

369
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:56,050
I ain't gonna do that anymore.

370
00:11:56,051 --> 00:11:57,130
So I mean,

371
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:00,580
that's where I think you
get a pay off and you know,

372
00:12:00,581 --> 00:12:04,150
people go and find these
things on the Internet.

373
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:04,720
I mean,

374
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,590
last year,

375
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:05,950
you know,

376
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:07,330
we have a channel where we put up,

377
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:07,691
you know,

378
00:12:07,691 --> 00:12:12,190
different clips from a divorce shows
or parenting shows or whatever.

379
00:12:12,191 --> 00:12:15,100
And we had over 2 billion views.

380
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:15,760
You know,

381
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:19,000
last year or people just going and finding
that information and looking at it.

382
00:12:19,001 --> 00:12:23,620
So I know people are seeking
the information out and
looking at it beyond the

383
00:12:23,621 --> 00:12:24,460
show itself.

384
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:25,220
So,

385
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:25,670
you know,

386
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:29,770
they must be seeking information and
we just don't have a good distribution

387
00:12:29,771 --> 00:12:30,604
system,

388
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:31,330
uh,

389
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:32,590
for mental health in America.

390
00:12:32,591 --> 00:12:33,490
So I think they look,

391
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:35,020
I think they're hungry for it.

392
00:12:35,021 --> 00:12:35,720
And I looked for it.

393
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:38,990
Well there's so many people out there
that are trying to do better at trying to

394
00:12:38,991 --> 00:12:41,360
get their lives in order and you know,

395
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:42,680
shows like yours and,

396
00:12:42,681 --> 00:12:43,251
and you know,

397
00:12:43,251 --> 00:12:46,220
just advice shows people that are
giving out inspiration and knowledge.

398
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:47,481
It's so,

399
00:12:47,481 --> 00:12:49,730
it's such an important
thing for people to,

400
00:12:49,731 --> 00:12:53,810
especially for people that didn't grow
up with wise parents or they'd be a good

401
00:12:53,811 --> 00:12:54,980
support system around them.

402
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,033
No,

403
00:12:57,050 --> 00:12:57,883
I think that's,

404
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:58,880
that's true.

405
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:03,880
And I grew up with an alcoholic father
and it was a pretty violent home and,

406
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:08,270
and he was a really bad alcoholic.

407
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:13,070
And I know having grown up in that,

408
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:18,790
you wind up with what I call a damaged
personal truth and you feel second class.

409
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:26,240
And the problem that kids make.

410
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:27,230
And uh,

411
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:31,100
cause I know I did it
and I see others do it,

412
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,160
is you compare your personal truth,

413
00:13:34,161 --> 00:13:39,161
what you know about yourself and how you
really live and what's really going on.

414
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:45,070
You compare your personal
truth to everybody else's
social mask because you go

415
00:13:45,981 --> 00:13:47,180
to school and you know,

416
00:13:47,181 --> 00:13:51,740
well I know that last night the
windows got kicked out of my house.

417
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:55,010
I know that the utilities got turned off.

418
00:13:55,011 --> 00:13:59,510
And I know there was a big fight in my
kitchen last night and the kid sitting

419
00:13:59,511 --> 00:14:00,291
next to me,

420
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:05,270
he's got on a shirt that's all ironed
and his face is all bright and clean and

421
00:14:05,271 --> 00:14:05,511
you know,

422
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:10,130
he looks like he's just got it all
together and you compare yourself to that

423
00:14:10,131 --> 00:14:10,550
person,

424
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:11,383
that kid,

425
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:13,910
and you feel like you're second class.

426
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:19,070
And the problem with that is we
generate the results in life we think we

427
00:14:19,071 --> 00:14:19,904
deserve.

428
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:22,520
So if you think your damn is,

429
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:25,160
do you think your second
class you will generate

430
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:29,720
results that you think a
second class person deserves.

431
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:33,410
So if you don't fix your personal truth,

432
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,810
then you'll spend the
rest of your life saying,

433
00:14:35,811 --> 00:14:36,440
well,

434
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:36,711
you know,

435
00:14:36,711 --> 00:14:37,850
those really good results,

436
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,650
those belong for somebody else.

437
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:40,880
It's not for me.

438
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:42,470
That's for somebody else.

439
00:14:42,471 --> 00:14:47,450
And you'll settle for second best and
you won't get what you might otherwise

440
00:14:47,451 --> 00:14:49,880
generate for yourself if you
don't fix your personal truth.

441
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:55,820
And so I think a lot of
people are struggling looking
for a way to kind of get

442
00:14:55,821 --> 00:14:59,600
out of feeling not good about
themselves and damage self esteem,

443
00:14:59,601 --> 00:14:59,971
damage,

444
00:14:59,971 --> 00:15:00,501
self worth.

445
00:15:00,501 --> 00:15:01,850
And they really don't know where to go.

446
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:03,320
So,

447
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:03,690
uh,

448
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:05,480
and that's why I do the show.

449
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,201
I don't look,

450
00:15:06,201 --> 00:15:09,440
I'm not under the misapprehension that
we're doing eight minute cures up there.

451
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:09,651
I mean,

452
00:15:09,651 --> 00:15:10,970
come on you,

453
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:11,983
we're not doing that.

454
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:15,380
But I think if you can point
people in the right direction,

455
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:18,050
if you can raise their awareness,

456
00:15:18,051 --> 00:15:19,340
you can get them thinking about it.

457
00:15:19,341 --> 00:15:22,040
You can create a narrative
where they at least say,

458
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:22,371
you know,

459
00:15:22,371 --> 00:15:23,960
how do I feel about myself?

460
00:15:23,961 --> 00:15:24,794
I mean,

461
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:27,050
is there stuff I need to resolve?

462
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:27,740
I mean,

463
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:29,210
what am I saying to myself?

464
00:15:29,211 --> 00:15:30,500
If you can get them thinking about that,

465
00:15:30,501 --> 00:15:31,101
then you know,

466
00:15:31,101 --> 00:15:32,210
maybe you've done something.

467
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:32,871
Yeah.

468
00:15:32,871 --> 00:15:33,081
You know,

469
00:15:33,081 --> 00:15:34,630
Tony Robbins once said once said,

470
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:38,000
it's incremental changes over the long
haul and the way you have to look at it

471
00:15:38,001 --> 00:15:41,390
as if these two boats are going in a
parallel direction and one of them just

472
00:15:41,391 --> 00:15:44,120
shifts five degrees
over the course of time,

473
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:47,420
this boat is going to be in a far
different place than the other boat that's

474
00:15:47,421 --> 00:15:48,141
going in the same way.

475
00:15:48,141 --> 00:15:48,974
It was always going.

476
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:50,071
Yeah.

477
00:15:50,071 --> 00:15:55,071
And the important thing to realize as
well is the next year is going to go by

478
00:15:55,171 --> 00:15:57,450
whether you're doing something
about your life or not.

479
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:58,261
I mean,

480
00:15:58,261 --> 00:15:58,501
we're,

481
00:15:58,501 --> 00:16:03,501
we're sitting here right now at the end
of February and the next 10 months are

482
00:16:06,361 --> 00:16:10,650
going to go by whether somebody is
working to make change or whether they're

483
00:16:10,651 --> 00:16:11,484
not.

484
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:12,221
And they may think,

485
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:12,510
you know,

486
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:13,201
Oh my God,

487
00:16:13,201 --> 00:16:17,850
I'm so far away and I'll never get it
under control or I'm so behind in my bills

488
00:16:17,851 --> 00:16:18,684
or I'm so,

489
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:20,083
uh,

490
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:20,520
you know,

491
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,940
just depressed or,

492
00:16:21,941 --> 00:16:22,774
uh,

493
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,990
everything is so out of control.

494
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:25,651
Well,

495
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:26,340
you know what,

496
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:31,340
you make those incremental changes and
then you know pretty soon in December you

497
00:16:31,591 --> 00:16:31,890
go,

498
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:32,723
Hey,

499
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,910
I'm way better off than I
was at the end of February,

500
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:36,893
so shit,

501
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:40,830
you made little changes and they
all ended up and if you don't,

502
00:16:40,831 --> 00:16:41,551
by the end of the year,

503
00:16:41,551 --> 00:16:42,450
you're just in deeper.

504
00:16:42,451 --> 00:16:43,650
So every little bit matters.

505
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:44,421
Yeah.

506
00:16:44,421 --> 00:16:44,551
I,

507
00:16:44,551 --> 00:16:46,190
I tell people to write things down.

508
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:49,400
I said one of the best ways to get
things done is to write things down.

509
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:51,350
Write down what you're trying to get done.

510
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,230
Write down what you need to get done on
a longterm basis in which you need to

511
00:16:54,231 --> 00:16:56,780
get done in a short term basis
and write off a checklist.

512
00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:57,651
Force yourself.

513
00:16:57,651 --> 00:16:58,484
Be Accountable.

514
00:16:58,790 --> 00:16:59,120
Yeah.

515
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:03,440
The difference between a dream and a
goal is a timeline and accountability.

516
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:05,270
Accountability is gigantic.

517
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:06,550
You got to have somebody,

518
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:10,840
whether it's yourself or a friend
or somebody that's going to say,

519
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:11,853
look,

520
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:14,560
did you do what you said you
were going to do by this time?

521
00:17:14,561 --> 00:17:16,240
And if you don't hold
your feet to the fire,

522
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:17,920
because I mean,

523
00:17:17,921 --> 00:17:19,810
just sitting around dreaming some day,

524
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:22,600
some day I'm going to get a different job.

525
00:17:22,601 --> 00:17:24,160
Some day I'm going to change.

526
00:17:24,161 --> 00:17:26,050
This will someday ain't a day of the week.

527
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:27,461
You know,

528
00:17:27,461 --> 00:17:29,530
there's Monday,

529
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:29,530
Tuesday,

530
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:29,530
Wednesday,

531
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:29,530
Thursday,

532
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:29,530
Friday,

533
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:29,530
Saturday,

534
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:29,531
Sunday.

535
00:17:29,531 --> 00:17:31,450
Look on your counter
some days not on there.

536
00:17:31,451 --> 00:17:33,280
So you got to say,

537
00:17:33,281 --> 00:17:34,000
okay,

538
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,070
I want to take this small step by here,

539
00:17:36,071 --> 00:17:37,030
this small step by their,

540
00:17:37,031 --> 00:17:37,930
this most step by there.

541
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:38,860
And then pretty soon,

542
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:39,581
you know,

543
00:17:39,581 --> 00:17:42,010
we don't leaps tall
buildings in a single bound.

544
00:17:42,011 --> 00:17:43,210
We take it a floor at a time.

545
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:44,850
And then

546
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:46,200
all the years you've been doing your show,

547
00:17:46,201 --> 00:17:47,850
you've developed a real community,

548
00:17:47,851 --> 00:17:48,090
right?

549
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:48,460
I mean,

550
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:48,620
you,

551
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:48,950
you,

552
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:51,240
you really have made an impact.

553
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:54,390
If you stop and think about all the people
that your show is touched and all the

554
00:17:54,391 --> 00:17:56,970
people that have listened to your advice
and all the people that have taken that

555
00:17:56,971 --> 00:17:57,804
advice and,

556
00:17:57,970 --> 00:18:01,620
and made those little incremental changes
in their lives and set those goals and

557
00:18:01,621 --> 00:18:02,790
held themselves accountable,

558
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:04,680
that's a pretty significant thing.

559
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,050
Well,

560
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:06,883
I hope so.

561
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:07,241
I mean,

562
00:18:07,241 --> 00:18:07,670
I,

563
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:08,503
I think,

564
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:14,650
I know that there's a stigma attached to
mental illness and that really bothers

565
00:18:16,251 --> 00:18:16,401
me.

566
00:18:16,401 --> 00:18:17,420
There should not be,

567
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:17,991
I mean,

568
00:18:17,991 --> 00:18:21,200
having depression or anxiety or whatever.

569
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:22,093
To me,

570
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:27,280
it should have no more stigma than having
a knee injury or kidney infection or

571
00:18:29,241 --> 00:18:29,960
diabetes.

572
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:34,960
But there is a stigma attached to it and
I've tried to talk about this in a way

573
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:40,730
where it's okay to talk about
it and not be ashamed of it.

574
00:18:40,731 --> 00:18:40,851
It's,

575
00:18:40,851 --> 00:18:42,980
it's okay if you've got anxiety,

576
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:44,930
you've got PTSD,

577
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:45,800
w whatever,

578
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:46,671
it's okay,

579
00:18:46,671 --> 00:18:47,481
let's talk about it.

580
00:18:47,481 --> 00:18:48,320
Let's get hell for it.

581
00:18:48,321 --> 00:18:49,670
Get it behind you and move on.

582
00:18:49,671 --> 00:18:50,350
I mean,

583
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:50,930
just not,

584
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:52,730
it's not something that
you should be ashamed of.

585
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:54,090
What do you mean

586
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:56,400
when you talking to someone
that maybe has depression,

587
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:59,470
do you try to get them to exercise first?

588
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:03,270
Do you try to get them to visit a
psychiatrist immediately and get on

589
00:19:03,271 --> 00:19:04,001
medication?

590
00:19:04,001 --> 00:19:06,390
Like do you take it on
a case by case basis?

591
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:07,261
Well,

592
00:19:07,261 --> 00:19:07,591
I do,

593
00:19:07,591 --> 00:19:08,880
but you have to approach it.

594
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:11,130
Everybody has a philosophy about it.

595
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:14,910
And I'm not saying that mine's
any better than anybody else's,

596
00:19:14,911 --> 00:19:19,911
but I do have a philosophy about
it and I'm very slow to medication.

597
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:21,311
I mean,

598
00:19:21,311 --> 00:19:22,144
I,

599
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:27,390
I think you used medication
for biochemical replacement.

600
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:28,141
I mean,

601
00:19:28,141 --> 00:19:32,190
if for some reason your body is not
making enough of something it needs,

602
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:37,170
then maybe you support it
short term biochemically.

603
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,033
But

604
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:42,180
I look at depression.

605
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,120
There's a lot of ways you can break it up,

606
00:19:45,121 --> 00:19:46,920
but I look at it like,

607
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:50,160
is it exogenous depression
or endogenous depression?

608
00:19:50,161 --> 00:19:50,401
I mean,

609
00:19:50,401 --> 00:19:54,450
is it coming from the inside
out or the outside in?

610
00:19:54,451 --> 00:19:56,370
Is it because you're
reacting to something?

611
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,170
I see a lot of depressed people that

612
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,010
in a sense it makes sense,

613
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:02,580
right?

614
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:02,851
I mean,

615
00:20:02,851 --> 00:20:04,050
you look at their life and you say,

616
00:20:04,051 --> 00:20:04,884
well,

617
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:06,870
if you're not down about this,

618
00:20:06,871 --> 00:20:07,800
you should be,

619
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:08,611
I mean,

620
00:20:08,611 --> 00:20:09,600
you've lost your job.

621
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:11,070
You've gotten a divorce,

622
00:20:11,071 --> 00:20:12,720
your health is in the shitter.

623
00:20:12,721 --> 00:20:13,554
You're,

624
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:14,101
I mean,

625
00:20:14,101 --> 00:20:15,810
you should be down about this.

626
00:20:15,811 --> 00:20:17,430
It's external things.

627
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:20,190
So you don't need a pill.

628
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,000
I mean,

629
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,140
put somebody in a chemical straight
jacket because their life's fallen apart.

630
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:27,440
What the hell's that gonna do then?

631
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,210
That's just putting goggles on
him where they can't see it.

632
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:35,240
I would much rather get them to
behave their way to success and say,

633
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:38,700
what are you reacting to
that you're depressed about?

634
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:42,180
Let's put that on a to do list and start,

635
00:20:42,181 --> 00:20:42,841
like you said,

636
00:20:42,841 --> 00:20:45,930
write it down and start
crossing those things off.

637
00:20:45,931 --> 00:20:49,600
Let's figure what's an action plan to
change this action plan to change the next

638
00:20:49,601 --> 00:20:50,434
thing I clean.

639
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:52,870
And then when you start doing that,

640
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:55,810
then you generally see their mood lift.

641
00:20:55,811 --> 00:21:00,811
A lot of people that are depressed or
just realistically reacting to a crummy

642
00:21:00,971 --> 00:21:02,350
circumstance in their life.

643
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:05,320
It's not necessarily a a mental illness,

644
00:21:05,321 --> 00:21:10,000
it's just a re realistic reaction
to a bad spot in their life.

645
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:10,891
Yeah,

646
00:21:10,891 --> 00:21:14,340
that's such a way good way of putting
it to that you weren't in a bad state

647
00:21:14,341 --> 00:21:16,850
looking at this might
be something wrong with,

648
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:17,150
yeah,

649
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:17,990
you're in denial.

650
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:18,923
Yeah.

651
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:19,430
I mean if,

652
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:19,970
if,

653
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:20,900
if you've gotten a divorce,

654
00:21:20,901 --> 00:21:21,800
lost your job,

655
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:23,600
your health's in bad shape,

656
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:27,380
your kids are alienated
from you and you're saying,

657
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:28,393
I'm fine,

658
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:31,460
then you're not in touch with reality,

659
00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:33,530
you should be bothered by that.

660
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:34,833
And,

661
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:39,880
and I think to give somebody a pill to
mask your feelings about that just keeps

662
00:21:41,661 --> 00:21:42,680
you off task.

663
00:21:42,681 --> 00:21:43,070
I don't,

664
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:44,570
your pain's a good motivator.

665
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,113
Um,

666
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:46,850
you know,

667
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:51,850
I grew up in like Texas and Oklahoma
and I don't know you've ever done this,

668
00:21:52,341 --> 00:21:53,510
but we were,

669
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:58,670
I used to spend my summers in the
thriving metropolis of Monday,

670
00:21:58,671 --> 00:21:59,181
Texas.

671
00:21:59,181 --> 00:22:00,020
You ever heard of Monday,

672
00:22:00,021 --> 00:22:00,620
Texas?

673
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:01,130
No.

674
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:01,731
It's him.

675
00:22:01,731 --> 00:22:02,630
You in?

676
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:03,851
It's a U.

677
00:22:03,851 --> 00:22:04,101
Dot.

678
00:22:04,101 --> 00:22:06,470
N.

679
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:06,470
O.

680
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:06,470
M.

681
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:06,470
U.

682
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:06,470
N.

683
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:06,470
D.

684
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:06,470
A.

685
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:06,500
Y.

686
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,870
It's got like 2000 people in it,

687
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:13,700
but in the summers it
would get hot in Monday,

688
00:22:13,701 --> 00:22:14,450
Texas.

689
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:16,130
And when I say hot,

690
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:19,160
I mean you look out in the backyard
and your dog burst into flame.

691
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,240
This is what I'm talking about.

692
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,020
So we would be going to the
swimming pool or something,

693
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:24,883
barefooted.

694
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:30,430
And you get halfway across an asphalt
road and you look down and you're like,

695
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:32,601
Holy Shit,

696
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:32,751
me,

697
00:22:32,751 --> 00:22:34,070
your feet are just on fire.

698
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:36,080
So what are you going to do?

699
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:37,011
I mean,

700
00:22:37,011 --> 00:22:38,150
that is painful.

701
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:39,890
You're going to do one of two things.

702
00:22:39,891 --> 00:22:43,370
You're either going to make a u turn and
get your ass back over to the side of

703
00:22:43,371 --> 00:22:47,030
the road and getting the grass or you're
going to run to the other side and get

704
00:22:47,031 --> 00:22:48,200
off the road and getting the grass.

705
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:52,670
But you are not going to stand there in
the middle of the road and melt yourself

706
00:22:52,671 --> 00:22:53,690
down to the knees.

707
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:56,420
Pain is a motivator.

708
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:59,120
Paint is not necessarily always bad.

709
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:00,680
If you're in pain,

710
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:04,250
it's going to motivate you
to move to change something.

711
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:08,720
And the mash that with drugs to dull
that pain with drugs is not necessarily a

712
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:09,500
good thing.

713
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:10,820
That is wise,

714
00:23:10,821 --> 00:23:12,770
wise advice and um,

715
00:23:12,771 --> 00:23:14,060
I wish more people thought that way.

716
00:23:14,061 --> 00:23:15,290
Particularly more doctors.

717
00:23:15,291 --> 00:23:15,531
You know,

718
00:23:15,531 --> 00:23:18,750
I have so many friends that have gone to
a doctor cause I'm not feeling so good

719
00:23:18,751 --> 00:23:23,300
and that they're almost
immediately wanting to throw
him on something that's not

720
00:23:23,301 --> 00:23:23,800
smart.

721
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,160
And all the years you've been doing this,

722
00:23:25,161 --> 00:23:29,560
have you noticed like was
depression as prevalent like the,

723
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:31,430
the term depression or was it,

724
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:31,971
it doesn't,

725
00:23:31,971 --> 00:23:36,971
I mean I don't really remember it
being a thing when I was a kid that was

726
00:23:37,071 --> 00:23:38,900
discussed the way it's discussed now.

727
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:43,250
Now it's discussed the way people
discuss all sorts of other ailments.

728
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,960
Is it just an awareness thing?

729
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,250
Is it just people

730
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:48,320
were thinking about it
now in different terms?

731
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:48,651
Well,

732
00:23:48,651 --> 00:23:50,150
I think as part of the narrative now,

733
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:51,530
and I think with social media,

734
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:53,660
with the Internet,

735
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:54,560
not just social media,

736
00:23:54,561 --> 00:23:55,394
with the Internet,

737
00:23:56,570 --> 00:23:58,520
I think there's just a lot more,

738
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,100
it's a lot more in the nomenclature.

739
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:02,150
Um,

740
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:03,740
and there's a lot more awareness about it.

741
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,233
Um,

742
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:09,650
but I think it was just as prevalent in
the fifties and sixties as it was now.

743
00:24:09,651 --> 00:24:14,651
But in the fifties and sixties there
wasn't a psychologist on every corner and

744
00:24:14,751 --> 00:24:19,751
there is now and there wasn't
sub doctoral licensing then.

745
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:20,121
I mean,

746
00:24:20,121 --> 00:24:20,600
you,

747
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:21,200
what does that mean?

748
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,010
Well,

749
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:27,010
back then that you had to have a phd or
an MD as a psychiatrist to see patients.

750
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:29,751
Now they have marriage.

751
00:24:29,751 --> 00:24:30,720
And family therapist,

752
00:24:30,721 --> 00:24:31,970
they've licensed social workers,

753
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:33,410
they have different levels,

754
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:34,341
uh,

755
00:24:34,341 --> 00:24:35,990
where you can do independent practice.

756
00:24:35,991 --> 00:24:40,991
So that's broadened the number of
people that can provide services.

757
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:43,400
And some people think that's a good thing.

758
00:24:43,401 --> 00:24:44,540
Some people think it's not.

759
00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:45,963
Um,

760
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:47,270
I generally think it's a,

761
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:52,540
it's a good thing because I think
[inaudible] 58% of our rural markets today

762
00:24:55,250 --> 00:25:00,250
have no psychiatrist available
and something like 50 or
roughly have no mental

763
00:25:04,791 --> 00:25:06,890
health professional available at all.

764
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:08,143
None.

765
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:13,240
So there's just nobody available to
help people in the outlying areas.

766
00:25:13,611 --> 00:25:17,360
So I think the more people you
can get into the profession,

767
00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:17,990
uh,

768
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:21,440
so long as there's a degree
of competency is better.

769
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:21,950
But,

770
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:22,161
you know,

771
00:25:22,161 --> 00:25:23,630
I think it's always been prevalent.

772
00:25:23,631 --> 00:25:25,490
I just think people didn't
talk about it very much.

773
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:28,190
It's just something that I swallowed
or they took the church or,

774
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:28,800
yeah.

775
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:29,633
Yeah.

776
00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:31,520
When you see,

777
00:25:31,521 --> 00:25:31,840
uh,

778
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:32,673
you know,

779
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:33,590
these,

780
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:35,810
all these folks that
are on medication today,

781
00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:36,381
I mean,

782
00:25:36,381 --> 00:25:39,680
how many of these people do you think
legitimately should be on medication?

783
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:40,543
I mean,

784
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:41,181
I mean,

785
00:25:41,181 --> 00:25:42,950
is it something that you can assess?

786
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:44,391
You know,

787
00:25:44,391 --> 00:25:44,870
I,

788
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:46,610
I can't answer that in terms.

789
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:51,380
I mean I'm sure there's
research of people,

790
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:53,480
how many people are on medication.

791
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:56,510
But in my personal experience,

792
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:01,880
most of the people that
I see on medications,

793
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:03,470
in my opinion,

794
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:07,160
don't need most of the
medications they're on now.

795
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,720
That's just anecdotal.

796
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:09,531
It's my opinion.

797
00:26:09,531 --> 00:26:13,370
He asked me to hand you a research
survey or study to support that.

798
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:16,550
I can't hand it to you or
I can't point you to one.

799
00:26:16,551 --> 00:26:19,340
I'll just tell you after 45
years in this experience,

800
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,640
I see people that are on medication,

801
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,230
they've usually seen,

802
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:25,173
um,

803
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:30,460
someone for six or eight minutes and said,

804
00:26:30,711 --> 00:26:30,981
you know,

805
00:26:30,981 --> 00:26:32,390
I'm really feeling kind of down a blue.

806
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,010
Yup,

807
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:34,970
here's some Prozac,

808
00:26:34,971 --> 00:26:35,541
here's this,

809
00:26:35,541 --> 00:26:36,170
here's that.

810
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:37,003
They give it to them.

811
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:42,220
They don't even really ask why and they
just give it to him because medicine has

812
00:26:45,091 --> 00:26:46,680
become a high volume business.

813
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,880
And that's not necessarily
the doctor's fault.

814
00:26:50,881 --> 00:26:54,600
I mean the way that it's now
funded and Medicare and Medicaid,

815
00:26:54,601 --> 00:26:56,150
you got to turn them
and burn them and yeah,

816
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,500
or you can't stay in business.

817
00:26:58,530 --> 00:27:00,480
And so it's a high volume business.

818
00:27:00,481 --> 00:27:04,830
And so they throw pills at them because
they don't have an hour to sit down or

819
00:27:04,831 --> 00:27:06,690
don't take an hour to sit
down and talk about and say,

820
00:27:06,691 --> 00:27:07,050
well,

821
00:27:07,050 --> 00:27:08,460
was fine at what's going on.

822
00:27:08,461 --> 00:27:09,390
Is there a reason?

823
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:10,190
Like I said,

824
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:15,060
if this guy's got five parts of his life
that have gone down or a woman has got

825
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:18,480
three or four areas of her life
that have really gone down in,

826
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:19,410
in quality,

827
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:23,730
then they should be having poor mood.

828
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:25,470
So why mask that?

829
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:28,560
Let's come up with an
action plan and change it.

830
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:31,440
So most of the people I see on medication,

831
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:32,303
not all,

832
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:37,880
but most of the people I see are on too
many medications in too high a dose or

833
00:27:39,241 --> 00:27:43,260
either don't need it at all and I'm
really bothered by polypharmacy.

834
00:27:43,261 --> 00:27:45,690
That's where I really get frustrated.

835
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:46,511
Yeah.

836
00:27:46,511 --> 00:27:49,540
This is what you're saying is
a very common sense approach,

837
00:27:49,541 --> 00:27:52,240
but it's not the norm today.

838
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:52,750
No.

839
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:55,060
It seems like more
people are treating this,

840
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:55,481
you know,

841
00:27:55,481 --> 00:27:56,051
air quotes,

842
00:27:56,051 --> 00:27:58,540
depression issue as if
it's a medical disorder,

843
00:27:58,541 --> 00:27:59,230
like,

844
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:02,020
like diabetes or something
where you need medication.

845
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:03,610
Yeah.

846
00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:06,070
And look for a lot of people that works.

847
00:28:06,071 --> 00:28:09,670
I mean you give people a
mood elevator and they say,

848
00:28:09,671 --> 00:28:09,881
hey,

849
00:28:09,881 --> 00:28:10,810
I feel better.

850
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:12,720
And then maybe they change their life.

851
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:14,970
Maybe they move their life
into a more positive direction.

852
00:28:14,971 --> 00:28:16,200
They can wean themselves off of it.

853
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,580
Because one of the things
about depression for example,

854
00:28:18,581 --> 00:28:19,690
you're using that as an example,

855
00:28:19,691 --> 00:28:24,250
is you get what's referred to
as psychomotor retardation.

856
00:28:24,251 --> 00:28:24,730
There's a,

857
00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:27,730
there's a lessening in activity level.

858
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:29,123
Um,

859
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:33,340
and I think old sayings get to be
old sayings because they're profound.

860
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:36,820
Like you're not going to get
hit if you're not swinging well.

861
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:38,290
Um,

862
00:28:38,290 --> 00:28:43,290
if you're depressed and
so you think slower,

863
00:28:44,410 --> 00:28:45,520
less actively,

864
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:48,400
you behave less actively,

865
00:28:49,090 --> 00:28:51,430
your chance of getting rewarded goes down,

866
00:28:51,431 --> 00:28:51,970
right?

867
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:55,450
You don't get out there and you
don't mix it up socially as much.

868
00:28:55,451 --> 00:28:57,610
You don't apply for jobs as much.

869
00:28:57,611 --> 00:28:59,980
You're not as productive
on your job as much,

870
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,760
so you're less likely to get strokes.

871
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:04,120
You're less likely to get rewarded.

872
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:05,590
Well,

873
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:09,370
maybe you go take a pill and it lifts
your mood up so you get more active.

874
00:29:09,371 --> 00:29:11,290
And so now you can start
getting pats on the back.

875
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:13,450
You start getting people
to engage with you more,

876
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:16,600
so that lifts your mood and
is that takes care of it.

877
00:29:16,601 --> 00:29:19,030
So you took the medication short term,

878
00:29:19,031 --> 00:29:21,040
you're lifted back up and you're okay.

879
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:24,550
Short term it can be an alternative.

880
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:30,420
But I've seen people on everything from
opioids to mood elevators for years and

881
00:29:33,221 --> 00:29:34,930
that's where you lose me.

882
00:29:34,970 --> 00:29:36,040
I just don't get it.

883
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,160
Yeah.

884
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:37,770
Um,

885
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:40,290
I know people that had been on things
since they were five years old.

886
00:29:40,330 --> 00:29:40,520
Yeah.

887
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:41,500
And they're in their forties.

888
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:42,423
Yeah.

889
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:47,640
And then you have wastebasket diagnosis
like add and ADHD where you know what

890
00:29:49,031 --> 00:29:53,410
used to be a spoiled
brat is now add or Adhd.

891
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,550
So they start prescribing um,

892
00:29:56,680 --> 00:30:00,400
these Ritalin neo cortical
stimulants like Ritalin.

893
00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:05,350
And if you give a kid that does
not need a neocortical stimulant,

894
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:06,543
a stimulant,

895
00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:10,480
you're really going to throw him
off the charts now cause you're,

896
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:15,540
you've got an normally active brain
that you're now making hyperactive.

897
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:20,650
So you're creating a problem that
didn't exist before you gave him the

898
00:30:20,651 --> 00:30:23,170
medication because you didn't
do the proper diagnosis.

899
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:23,781
Yeah,

900
00:30:23,781 --> 00:30:26,450
I had my old neighbor had
a situation like that.

901
00:30:26,451 --> 00:30:29,690
They had a kid and the kid was just had
a lot of energy and they weren't paying

902
00:30:29,691 --> 00:30:32,420
attention to them and so
they started medicating them.

903
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:34,580
It's insanely common.

904
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:35,210
Yeah.

905
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:39,800
And you cannot chemically babysit your
children and who knows where these kids

906
00:30:39,801 --> 00:30:40,491
are going to be 20,

907
00:30:40,491 --> 00:30:41,330
30 years from now.

908
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:41,541
I mean,

909
00:30:41,541 --> 00:30:46,541
we're just looking at this rash of
people being treated for these ailments,

910
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:51,170
air quotes and then when we're not seeing
how this all turns out in the long run

911
00:30:51,171 --> 00:30:52,790
and how much damage we're
doing to these people.

912
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:53,873
No.

913
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:55,381
In fairness,

914
00:30:55,381 --> 00:30:56,820
on the other end of the continuum,

915
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:01,920
I have seen some people
that are clearly psychotic.

916
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:02,820
Uh,

917
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:03,653
schizophrenia,

918
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:04,920
delusional,

919
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:10,520
that without medication are
absolutely impossible to manage.

920
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:17,270
But if you put them on anti psychotics
and so you can lower their delusional

921
00:31:18,421 --> 00:31:19,560
behavior there,

922
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:20,940
hallucinatory behavior,

923
00:31:20,941 --> 00:31:25,941
so you can now have a
meaningful conversation with
them so they can respond to

924
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:29,730
talking therapies.

925
00:31:30,270 --> 00:31:31,830
It makes all the difference in the world.

926
00:31:31,831 --> 00:31:33,810
And without those anti-psychotics,

927
00:31:33,870 --> 00:31:36,300
you would be lost without them.

928
00:31:36,301 --> 00:31:41,301
So there are some medications for some
disorders that are absolute miracles that

929
00:31:42,091 --> 00:31:44,670
without them you wouldn't be able to
do the work you need to do to get the

930
00:31:44,671 --> 00:31:45,990
person back where they need to be.

931
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:46,301
Yeah,

932
00:31:46,301 --> 00:31:46,991
unquestionably.

933
00:31:46,991 --> 00:31:49,750
I mean there's definitely a lot of great
pharmaceutical drugs that helped a lot

934
00:31:49,751 --> 00:31:50,560
of people.

935
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:55,420
Do you get pushback from a lot of these
positions from the established medical

936
00:31:55,421 --> 00:31:56,254
community?

937
00:31:56,770 --> 00:31:56,951
You know,

938
00:31:56,951 --> 00:31:57,620
sometimes,

939
00:31:57,620 --> 00:31:58,453
but you know,

940
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:02,830
mostly when you talk to
people about it thoughtfully.

941
00:32:03,610 --> 00:32:04,443
Um,

942
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:07,690
they agree with,

943
00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:09,760
with what I'm saying.

944
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:14,790
I mean most people will agree that you
need to be thoughtful about prescribing

945
00:32:14,831 --> 00:32:19,831
medications and that medications
are too readily administered.

946
00:32:21,191 --> 00:32:24,520
I mean that's certainly what we've
seen in the opioid epidemic right now.

947
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:25,930
Um,

948
00:32:25,930 --> 00:32:29,650
opioids are so readily prescribed
right now that there are Neff opioid

949
00:32:29,651 --> 00:32:31,810
prescriptions for every man,

950
00:32:31,811 --> 00:32:34,060
woman and child in America
to have their own bottle.

951
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:39,860
And if you renew that
prescription one time,

952
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:42,021
one time,

953
00:32:42,021 --> 00:32:45,680
if you are taking those
opioids at the seven day mark,

954
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:50,420
your chance of being addicted
at one year is one in 12.

955
00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:52,580
And if you renew it at,

956
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:54,650
if you're still taking them at 30 days,

957
00:32:55,490 --> 00:32:58,790
your likelihood of being
addicted is one in three.

958
00:32:59,120 --> 00:32:59,953
Wow.

959
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:05,620
And these things are getting written
with way too high appeal count.

960
00:33:07,430 --> 00:33:09,260
And it's,

961
00:33:09,390 --> 00:33:10,940
and so the addictions,

962
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:11,260
uh,

963
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:11,590
we're,

964
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:16,590
we're seeing a whole different kind of
addiction now coming out of the suburbs

965
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:21,620
and they take them for a while and they're
very expensive and actually take him

966
00:33:21,621 --> 00:33:22,131
for a while.

967
00:33:22,131 --> 00:33:23,090
Heroin's cheaper.

968
00:33:23,990 --> 00:33:26,540
So they dumped the opioids
and start taking heroin.

969
00:33:26,541 --> 00:33:27,890
So you're saying soccer mom,

970
00:33:27,891 --> 00:33:32,891
heroin addicts that you weren't saying
10 years ago because they get started on

971
00:33:33,201 --> 00:33:35,570
prescription opioids and
in the can't afford them.

972
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:38,030
Or finally the doctor cuts them off,

973
00:33:38,031 --> 00:33:41,210
but they're addicted and so they start
taking heroin because it's cheaper.

974
00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:43,550
Now this is obviously a
very disturbing pattern,

975
00:33:43,551 --> 00:33:44,720
but where do you see us going?

976
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,790
Like when you look at the future and mean?

977
00:33:46,791 --> 00:33:48,470
It looks bleak in that regard.

978
00:33:48,471 --> 00:33:48,651
I mean,

979
00:33:48,651 --> 00:33:51,500
I've known several people that
have had real problems with pills.

980
00:33:52,390 --> 00:33:52,870
Yeah.

981
00:33:52,870 --> 00:33:54,290
The problem that,

982
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,530
that I think people have is they think,

983
00:33:56,560 --> 00:34:00,730
because a doctor gave me this because
it's on a prescription pad that this is

984
00:34:00,731 --> 00:34:01,210
safe,

985
00:34:01,210 --> 00:34:05,320
that your body doesn't know whether you
got that in a back alley or you got it

986
00:34:05,321 --> 00:34:06,154
from a doctor.

987
00:34:07,330 --> 00:34:09,700
It still has the same addictive quality.

988
00:34:09,701 --> 00:34:11,770
And I think it is at an epidemic level.

989
00:34:11,771 --> 00:34:16,771
And I've testified before Congress about
this and I think there were several

990
00:34:18,131 --> 00:34:22,360
levels of accountability
at the manufacturing level
and at the prescription

991
00:34:22,361 --> 00:34:24,670
level and at the educational level.

992
00:34:24,671 --> 00:34:25,990
So people understand,

993
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:27,250
uh,

994
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:30,910
I think everybody has to take part of it
and I'm doing everything I can to raise

995
00:34:30,911 --> 00:34:32,380
the awareness about it as well.

996
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:33,930
When you testified before Congress,

997
00:34:33,931 --> 00:34:34,920
what was the reaction?

998
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:36,210
Uh,

999
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:41,210
they're very much aware that
this has become a serious,

1000
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:46,550
serious problem because the cost as,

1001
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:51,640
as you see the last labor in the
workforce is in the billions of dollars.

1002
00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:53,390
You,

1003
00:34:53,390 --> 00:34:54,360
you see the,

1004
00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:55,450
the,

1005
00:34:55,450 --> 00:34:55,980
uh,

1006
00:34:55,980 --> 00:35:00,980
demands on the healthcare system that
this is creating a young mothers with,

1007
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:06,600
with children and babies born
addicted to these opioids.

1008
00:35:06,601 --> 00:35:08,670
I mean the numbers are just
going through the roof.

1009
00:35:08,671 --> 00:35:09,180
So,

1010
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:14,040
I mean it's putting a strain financially
on healthcare system that it just can't

1011
00:35:14,041 --> 00:35:14,521
stand.

1012
00:35:14,521 --> 00:35:19,521
So you start costing money and it
starts getting politicians' attention.

1013
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:21,151
So they start saying,

1014
00:35:21,151 --> 00:35:21,361
okay,

1015
00:35:21,361 --> 00:35:22,740
now we gotta start doing something.

1016
00:35:22,741 --> 00:35:23,300
So they,

1017
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:24,031
they get it.

1018
00:35:24,031 --> 00:35:25,200
They get that there's a problem.

1019
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:28,580
What could they do though once it
seems like once that genie's out of the

1020
00:35:28,581 --> 00:35:29,414
bottle?

1021
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:35,210
Well clearly you've got to
start educating people and

1022
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:41,860
the manufacturers have to be required to
start labeling this much more clearly.

1023
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:46,490
Physicians have to be much more um,

1024
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:49,860
conservative in prescribing.

1025
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:51,173
Um,

1026
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:51,361
you know,

1027
00:35:51,361 --> 00:35:54,990
I just had to shoulder surgery and um,

1028
00:35:55,430 --> 00:35:57,720
I took like one,

1029
00:35:58,590 --> 00:35:59,670
one opioid,

1030
00:35:59,671 --> 00:36:04,671
one pill they gave me in the hospital and
after that you can manage it with like

1031
00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:08,040
Tylenol or something.

1032
00:36:08,041 --> 00:36:12,570
Cause the surgeons now are so good with
the arthroscopic surgeries and stuff,

1033
00:36:12,571 --> 00:36:16,230
it's so much less of
an insult to the body.

1034
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:17,550
Uh,

1035
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:20,100
that was ice and Tylenol and stuff.

1036
00:36:20,101 --> 00:36:23,550
You can manage it if you just
kind of focus on it a little bit.

1037
00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:26,190
And then I might say,

1038
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:26,640
and if,

1039
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:29,610
if you've had surgery and
you're having organic pain,

1040
00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:31,350
for God's sakes,

1041
00:36:31,351 --> 00:36:33,000
get ahead of the pain and stay ahead.

1042
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:34,800
But when you,

1043
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:36,540
as soon as you can get off of it,

1044
00:36:36,541 --> 00:36:38,730
get off of it and
understand what's happening.

1045
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:39,050
Yeah.

1046
00:36:39,050 --> 00:36:40,820
There's no sense of being like macho.

1047
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:43,740
We don't need a leather strap between
your cheese and go have some surgery.

1048
00:36:43,741 --> 00:36:44,310
I mean,

1049
00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:44,611
shit,

1050
00:36:44,611 --> 00:36:45,091
if it hurts,

1051
00:36:45,091 --> 00:36:46,500
take the pill and get past it,

1052
00:36:46,501 --> 00:36:49,830
but realize the minute you
can get away from that,

1053
00:36:49,831 --> 00:36:50,880
you need to get away from it.

1054
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:51,871
But you know,

1055
00:36:51,871 --> 00:36:54,570
they don't need to give
you a 30 day supply.

1056
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:55,110
Right.

1057
00:36:55,110 --> 00:36:58,470
They need to give you three or four
days and then you've got to go see your

1058
00:36:58,471 --> 00:36:59,251
doctor again.

1059
00:36:59,251 --> 00:37:00,510
If it's still a problem,

1060
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:01,793
discuss it.

1061
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:02,731
I mean,

1062
00:37:02,731 --> 00:37:03,564
that's what the,

1063
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:06,690
that's what I think needs to happen to
just be a lot more conservative about

1064
00:37:06,691 --> 00:37:07,524
what you're giving

1065
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:08,500
is a promise.

1066
00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:10,670
These pharmaceutical
companies make so much money,

1067
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:11,870
they don't want to,

1068
00:37:11,870 --> 00:37:15,140
they don't want to back off that they
got private jets and yachts to pay for.

1069
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:15,881
Yeah,

1070
00:37:15,881 --> 00:37:17,020
they're starting to shut down.

1071
00:37:17,021 --> 00:37:17,854
Some of these,

1072
00:37:17,890 --> 00:37:22,890
they had some of these pill clinics in
pain clinics in Florida where you could

1073
00:37:23,921 --> 00:37:27,790
go in without an x ray without an MRI
and just say you had back pain and there

1074
00:37:27,791 --> 00:37:31,690
was a doctor there that would give you
a 90 count prescription on the spot.

1075
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:36,100
No questions asked 90 [inaudible] and
you're out the door and you go down the

1076
00:37:36,101 --> 00:37:36,934
street to the next one.

1077
00:37:37,210 --> 00:37:37,421
Yeah.

1078
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:38,590
Cause there was no database,

1079
00:37:38,830 --> 00:37:39,700
no database.

1080
00:37:39,850 --> 00:37:44,380
And that doctor might be a foreign
doctor that flew in from off shore road.

1081
00:37:44,381 --> 00:37:48,070
All the prescriptions during the day
flew off again at night and now they're

1082
00:37:48,071 --> 00:37:51,160
shutting that stuff down so
that the hammer's coming down.

1083
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:53,430
Well one can only hope.

1084
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:54,660
Um,

1085
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:56,100
when you've been doing your show,

1086
00:37:56,101 --> 00:37:59,300
as long as you've been
doing it and I'm sure you,

1087
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,410
you've made a ton of loot,

1088
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:01,970
what,

1089
00:38:01,970 --> 00:38:03,450
what makes you want to do a podcast?

1090
00:38:03,870 --> 00:38:04,703
Why doing that?

1091
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:08,100
Well my interest has been,

1092
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:14,040
you were saying there were a lot of
people getting their information on the

1093
00:38:14,041 --> 00:38:14,874
Internet.

1094
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:16,340
Hm.

1095
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:19,190
By getting clips of the
show and that sort of thing.

1096
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:25,540
And it's clear to me that is
the population is changing.

1097
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:26,451
You know,

1098
00:38:26,451 --> 00:38:27,284
I'm an old guy,

1099
00:38:27,290 --> 00:38:32,150
but younger people are getting
their information in different ways,

1100
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:32,560
you know,

1101
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:35,090
are going to the Internet and the

1102
00:38:36,730 --> 00:38:41,730
menu has got to be readily available and
you can reach a lot of people that way

1103
00:38:43,331 --> 00:38:44,650
that you wouldn't reach the other way.

1104
00:38:44,651 --> 00:38:49,420
There's a whole population that's not
going to watch broadcast television during

1105
00:38:49,421 --> 00:38:50,254
the day.

1106
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:54,320
And there's a whole population that's
watching broadcast television and today

1107
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:56,270
that maybe isn't on in,

1108
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,720
in the digital space.

1109
00:38:58,810 --> 00:39:03,810
And if I can get a crossover between the
two and you can get a bigger audience

1110
00:39:04,031 --> 00:39:05,140
to spread your message,

1111
00:39:05,141 --> 00:39:06,370
then you know,

1112
00:39:06,371 --> 00:39:07,540
that's what you're doing up.

1113
00:39:07,541 --> 00:39:12,541
My goal is to spread the message and
get what I think's important to say out

1114
00:39:12,851 --> 00:39:13,120
there.

1115
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,200
So I mean,

1116
00:39:14,201 --> 00:39:16,630
I'll shout it from the
rooftops if that's what I can,

1117
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:18,640
if I think that's effective,

1118
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:23,650
I want to do anything that's scalable
to get the message out there.

1119
00:39:23,651 --> 00:39:24,484
And,

1120
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:25,900
and to me,

1121
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:26,650
uh,

1122
00:39:26,650 --> 00:39:27,483
I'm doing,

1123
00:39:27,730 --> 00:39:31,120
I'm doing some different things in
the podcast and I'm doing on the show,

1124
00:39:31,121 --> 00:39:31,954
on the show.

1125
00:39:32,410 --> 00:39:34,030
I've got a fact pattern in front of me.

1126
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:34,960
I've got a story,

1127
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:36,640
I got a family,

1128
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:40,360
got an individual that's got a specific
fact pair and I'm dealing with that fact

1129
00:39:40,361 --> 00:39:42,850
pattern in the podcast.

1130
00:39:42,910 --> 00:39:44,140
I'm not solving a problem.

1131
00:39:44,141 --> 00:39:49,141
I don't have somebody there that
has a problem for me to solve.

1132
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:54,930
I'm just talking to people that I find
interesting and I'm able to talk to them

1133
00:39:55,241 --> 00:39:58,150
about whatever I want to talk to him about
and discuss things like you and I are

1134
00:39:58,151 --> 00:39:58,931
talking about right now.

1135
00:39:58,931 --> 00:39:59,764
I think this is,

1136
00:39:59,770 --> 00:40:04,770
I think what we've been talking about
is an important discussion and I welcome

1137
00:40:06,161 --> 00:40:10,420
the opportunity to have that discussion
and I don't have time to do that when

1138
00:40:10,421 --> 00:40:12,370
I'm talking about somebody
who's sitting there saying,

1139
00:40:12,371 --> 00:40:13,070
you know,

1140
00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:18,070
I think my kid is on the precipice of
overdosing or is really in trouble and

1141
00:40:19,731 --> 00:40:21,310
then I got to focus on that.

1142
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:26,340
I don't have time to pontificate about
such things as the opioid epidemic or the

1143
00:40:27,521 --> 00:40:31,540
philosophy of pills versus
therapy and things of that nature.

1144
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:36,670
Cause I have to give all my attention
to the story in front of me in a podcast

1145
00:40:36,671 --> 00:40:38,110
environment like we're doing now.

1146
00:40:38,530 --> 00:40:42,370
I can't talk about things that
I think people need to hear.

1147
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:42,921
I think it's,

1148
00:40:42,921 --> 00:40:43,481
if they don't,

1149
00:40:43,481 --> 00:40:44,320
they don't have to listen.

1150
00:40:44,321 --> 00:40:45,154
But if they,

1151
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:46,210
if they're interested,

1152
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:46,841
it's there.

1153
00:40:46,841 --> 00:40:51,490
So I like it being more free form and
me being able to talk about things.

1154
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:52,893
Um,

1155
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:55,660
I've been talking about what
makes people a champion.

1156
00:40:55,661 --> 00:41:00,070
Like I talked to Tony Romo
right after the Superbowl about,

1157
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:00,431
you know,

1158
00:41:00,431 --> 00:41:02,350
he came from eastern Illinois University.

1159
00:41:02,351 --> 00:41:03,320
It's like got what,

1160
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:08,200
nine students or something and he's a
little bit of university and he turns out

1161
00:41:08,201 --> 00:41:12,460
to be quarterback of
America's team for 14 years,

1162
00:41:12,461 --> 00:41:17,020
set all kinds of records and then goes
to the booth and becomes a number one

1163
00:41:17,021 --> 00:41:19,960
color analyst and
television mean champion,

1164
00:41:19,961 --> 00:41:20,920
champion champion.

1165
00:41:21,130 --> 00:41:22,330
Why you,

1166
00:41:22,331 --> 00:41:23,164
what is it that,

1167
00:41:23,470 --> 00:41:24,640
what do you attribute that to?

1168
00:41:24,641 --> 00:41:27,220
I like asking those questions
and hearing people talk.

1169
00:41:27,790 --> 00:41:29,800
What do you say to
young people about that?

1170
00:41:29,801 --> 00:41:30,990
What made you a champion?

1171
00:41:30,991 --> 00:41:35,390
Are you going to let your kids play
football with all the CTE and stuff?

1172
00:41:35,391 --> 00:41:35,541
What,

1173
00:41:35,541 --> 00:41:36,710
what do you say I'm at?

1174
00:41:36,770 --> 00:41:38,450
I like having those kind of conversation.

1175
00:41:38,451 --> 00:41:41,300
Did the same thing with Shaq and
Charles Barkley and different people.

1176
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:43,610
What did he say about
what makes you a champion,

1177
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:45,200
you know,

1178
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,100
for him?

1179
00:41:46,390 --> 00:41:47,223
Um,

1180
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:51,410
he said that he has this,

1181
00:41:51,411 --> 00:41:52,244
um,

1182
00:41:53,870 --> 00:41:55,040
he says he didn't,

1183
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:57,650
he wasn't the kind of
swagger sort of person that,

1184
00:41:57,700 --> 00:41:57,920
you know,

1185
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:02,360
came in cocky like he was going
to own the field and own the game.

1186
00:42:03,410 --> 00:42:08,410
But inside he said he had this
absolute drive that if he didn't win,

1187
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:18,940
he couldn't live with it is like if
somebody thought like he played the game,

1188
00:42:20,451 --> 00:42:21,800
somebody beat them,

1189
00:42:21,801 --> 00:42:22,640
beat him.

1190
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:28,070
That just the idea that that person
went home thinking that they were better

1191
00:42:28,071 --> 00:42:28,730
than him,

1192
00:42:28,730 --> 00:42:30,020
that they could beat him,

1193
00:42:31,070 --> 00:42:34,010
that he just couldn't eat sleep.

1194
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:38,510
Think until he got back and owned
it again and got back to it.

1195
00:42:38,511 --> 00:42:41,060
He said he just is this drive to win.

1196
00:42:41,930 --> 00:42:44,600
And so he would mean,

1197
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:47,780
he said he would be out at one o'clock
in the morning and the dome throwing a

1198
00:42:47,781 --> 00:42:48,500
pass,

1199
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:51,500
that that route got intercepted.

1200
00:42:51,501 --> 00:42:56,501
He got jumped on that route and he be
trying to figure out why on Thursday in

1201
00:42:58,161 --> 00:42:58,940
practice,

1202
00:42:58,940 --> 00:43:00,740
he saw what he needed to see,

1203
00:43:00,741 --> 00:43:02,300
why didn't he see it on Sunday?

1204
00:43:02,301 --> 00:43:05,390
And he would analyze and analyze and
analyze until he could get there,

1205
00:43:05,391 --> 00:43:06,141
until he could do it,

1206
00:43:06,141 --> 00:43:06,960
until he could win it.

1207
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,510
He just had this drive to win

1208
00:43:09,070 --> 00:43:11,560
that super unhealthy obsession.

1209
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:14,080
They all share that
Michael Jordan had that.

1210
00:43:14,081 --> 00:43:14,321
I mean,

1211
00:43:14,321 --> 00:43:16,340
we've talked about that
several times on the podcast.

1212
00:43:16,341 --> 00:43:19,300
So many people that are extreme winners,

1213
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:22,330
they're psychotic and their
obsession with winning.

1214
00:43:22,550 --> 00:43:23,050
Yeah.

1215
00:43:23,050 --> 00:43:24,460
That's all they wanna do.

1216
00:43:24,461 --> 00:43:26,320
And if they lose the date day,

1217
00:43:26,650 --> 00:43:27,570
it's almost in software,

1218
00:43:27,571 --> 00:43:28,840
but they almost can't deal with it.

1219
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:30,293
Yeah.

1220
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:31,050
And I,

1221
00:43:31,050 --> 00:43:33,660
I don't know if that's
necessarily a bad thing,

1222
00:43:33,661 --> 00:43:37,980
but the difference between winners
and losers as winners do things,

1223
00:43:37,981 --> 00:43:39,660
losers do not want to do.

1224
00:43:40,590 --> 00:43:41,010
They,

1225
00:43:41,010 --> 00:43:42,900
they will get up in the
middle of the night,

1226
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:43,980
they will do this,

1227
00:43:43,981 --> 00:43:44,850
they will do that.

1228
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:46,260
They feel it more.

1229
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:48,780
They just do things
losers don't want to do.

1230
00:43:48,781 --> 00:43:49,920
They pay a price.

1231
00:43:49,921 --> 00:43:51,360
Losers just don't want to pay.

1232
00:43:52,090 --> 00:43:53,460
And Luther say it's just not worth it.

1233
00:43:53,910 --> 00:43:55,860
And every winter has been loser.

1234
00:43:56,310 --> 00:43:58,250
Oh well that's what made him a winner.

1235
00:43:59,100 --> 00:43:59,933
If all you ever,

1236
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:00,461
if it's a,

1237
00:44:00,461 --> 00:44:03,450
if you go through life as
in a success only journey,

1238
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:04,921
God,

1239
00:44:04,921 --> 00:44:06,750
how boring would that be me?

1240
00:44:06,751 --> 00:44:07,860
You think it would be great,

1241
00:44:07,861 --> 00:44:11,580
but it's like eating ice cream every meal
about the fourth meal you're going to

1242
00:44:11,581 --> 00:44:12,240
be thinking,

1243
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:12,810
God,

1244
00:44:12,810 --> 00:44:14,130
let's kill something and eat it.

1245
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:16,850
Well it's like who are you
talking about about depression,

1246
00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:21,200
about that bad feelings will motivate
you to change if you're in a bad feeling,

1247
00:44:21,201 --> 00:44:21,591
if you're,

1248
00:44:21,591 --> 00:44:23,150
if you're in a bad state in your life,

1249
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:25,880
that pain is an amazing motivator.

1250
00:44:25,910 --> 00:44:28,580
And even though it feels
terrible at the time,

1251
00:44:28,790 --> 00:44:32,340
it can propel you to a new and better
life because you don't ever want to

1252
00:44:32,341 --> 00:44:35,250
experience that again and make
you grow and be a better person.

1253
00:44:36,010 --> 00:44:36,650
Yeah.

1254
00:44:36,650 --> 00:44:39,470
And you got to decide
what's your currency.

1255
00:44:39,471 --> 00:44:40,304
I mean,

1256
00:44:40,790 --> 00:44:42,200
cause you say,

1257
00:44:42,370 --> 00:44:42,581
you know,

1258
00:44:42,581 --> 00:44:46,040
you've done your show a long time
and probably don't need the money,

1259
00:44:47,030 --> 00:44:48,770
but there are different kinds of currency,

1260
00:44:48,771 --> 00:44:49,340
right?

1261
00:44:49,340 --> 00:44:54,140
I mean you don't always work
for one kind of currency.

1262
00:44:54,830 --> 00:44:58,280
I mean every year when we wrap our season,

1263
00:44:59,750 --> 00:45:03,370
I kind of take a month and
let everybody go and rat,

1264
00:45:03,430 --> 00:45:03,620
you know,

1265
00:45:03,620 --> 00:45:07,490
just kind of unwind and relax and kick
back and do whatever they want to do.

1266
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:11,240
And then we start meeting and focusing on,

1267
00:45:11,241 --> 00:45:12,074
okay,

1268
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:15,230
how can we reinvent
ourselves for next season?

1269
00:45:15,530 --> 00:45:17,480
How can we tell our stories better?

1270
00:45:17,481 --> 00:45:20,930
How can we broaden our horizons,

1271
00:45:20,931 --> 00:45:25,931
do things different so that we raise
our game because we're kind of competing

1272
00:45:26,541 --> 00:45:27,440
with ourselves.

1273
00:45:28,580 --> 00:45:29,000
There's,

1274
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:29,301
you know,

1275
00:45:29,301 --> 00:45:32,430
we're kind of in a category
by ourselves within the,

1276
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:34,070
when it does what we do.

1277
00:45:34,730 --> 00:45:39,660
And we've been number one for a long
time because I got a really hardworking

1278
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:40,041
team,

1279
00:45:40,041 --> 00:45:43,340
but we're in a s nobody
else tries to do what we do.

1280
00:45:43,341 --> 00:45:46,160
So we're kind of competing with ourselves.

1281
00:45:46,161 --> 00:45:47,380
And so we're,

1282
00:45:47,630 --> 00:45:51,410
we work real hard to figure out
how can we have a bigger impact?

1283
00:45:51,411 --> 00:45:54,080
How can we tell this more effectively?

1284
00:45:54,081 --> 00:45:59,081
What techniques can we come up with
that make this even more powerful,

1285
00:46:00,261 --> 00:46:01,790
more impactful than what it is?

1286
00:46:01,791 --> 00:46:02,624
And that's what,

1287
00:46:03,050 --> 00:46:03,290
you know,

1288
00:46:03,290 --> 00:46:05,120
that's what really gets me moving.

1289
00:46:05,390 --> 00:46:05,541
Well,

1290
00:46:05,541 --> 00:46:06,380
it's very telling.

1291
00:46:06,410 --> 00:46:06,621
It's,

1292
00:46:06,621 --> 00:46:06,891
I mean,

1293
00:46:06,891 --> 00:46:10,790
that's why I would imagine you move
towards doing a podcast where it's less

1294
00:46:10,791 --> 00:46:13,770
restrictive and more open ended and
you can kind of do whatever you want.

1295
00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:14,300
And,

1296
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:15,133
but it's,

1297
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:18,860
that's pretty cool that at all these
years of doing that and giving out advice,

1298
00:46:18,861 --> 00:46:20,930
he's still find this,

1299
00:46:21,020 --> 00:46:22,190
this passion to,

1300
00:46:22,310 --> 00:46:24,590
to make it better and to do
it from a different angle.

1301
00:46:25,740 --> 00:46:26,010
Yeah.

1302
00:46:26,010 --> 00:46:27,020
And you know,

1303
00:46:27,090 --> 00:46:28,500
I'm as excited about,

1304
00:46:28,710 --> 00:46:29,850
we're just about to wrap,

1305
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:30,401
you know,

1306
00:46:30,401 --> 00:46:31,420
our 17th season

1307
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:33,833
and uh,

1308
00:46:34,050 --> 00:46:34,883
that's a lot.

1309
00:46:35,610 --> 00:46:38,940
How many episodes you've
done coming up on 3000.

1310
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:40,073
Um,

1311
00:46:40,830 --> 00:46:43,380
and I did Oprah for five years before.

1312
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:44,160
Cool.

1313
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:44,993
And uh,

1314
00:46:45,030 --> 00:46:45,960
so that's,

1315
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:48,960
that's 22 years and then,

1316
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:52,380
and then I just renewed for five years,

1317
00:46:52,890 --> 00:46:54,030
moved out to 20,

1318
00:46:54,031 --> 00:46:56,280
23 before you sign that,

1319
00:46:56,281 --> 00:46:56,491
like,

1320
00:46:56,491 --> 00:46:57,324
what am I,

1321
00:46:57,350 --> 00:46:57,590
well,

1322
00:46:57,590 --> 00:46:58,620
let's go fishing.

1323
00:46:58,650 --> 00:46:58,861
You know,

1324
00:46:58,861 --> 00:47:00,210
Robin and I thought about it,

1325
00:47:00,450 --> 00:47:00,661
but,

1326
00:47:00,661 --> 00:47:00,841
well,

1327
00:47:00,841 --> 00:47:01,890
what am I going to do?

1328
00:47:01,891 --> 00:47:02,170
I mean,

1329
00:47:02,170 --> 00:47:03,003
I don't,

1330
00:47:03,430 --> 00:47:04,650
I don't want to see you enjoy it.

1331
00:47:04,710 --> 00:47:05,610
Obviously I do.

1332
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:06,181
Yeah,

1333
00:47:06,181 --> 00:47:06,750
I enjoy it.

1334
00:47:06,750 --> 00:47:11,750
He could tell and I've always told
my team the thing that we don't want,

1335
00:47:12,990 --> 00:47:14,400
I don't want to get bored.

1336
00:47:14,970 --> 00:47:17,160
And if it gets formulaic for me,

1337
00:47:17,161 --> 00:47:18,810
it'll be formulaic for the viewer.

1338
00:47:19,470 --> 00:47:20,820
And I don't want that to happen.

1339
00:47:20,821 --> 00:47:21,361
And you know,

1340
00:47:21,361 --> 00:47:26,361
we do a lot of news stories and stuff
and that keeps it fresh because you don't

1341
00:47:26,791 --> 00:47:28,530
know what's going to break
in the news tomorrow.

1342
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:34,040
And so we do most of the really big
news stories and we don't break the news

1343
00:47:35,371 --> 00:47:35,891
stories.

1344
00:47:35,891 --> 00:47:37,240
We go behind the headline,

1345
00:47:37,241 --> 00:47:39,130
talk about here's what really happened.

1346
00:47:39,970 --> 00:47:40,990
As Paul Harvey said,

1347
00:47:40,991 --> 00:47:44,290
here's the rest of the story is
what you read in the headline.

1348
00:47:44,291 --> 00:47:44,671
Now here's,

1349
00:47:44,671 --> 00:47:45,940
here's the rest of the story.

1350
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:48,280
And I really liked doing that.

1351
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:50,110
I really like getting into that.

1352
00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:52,173
Well,

1353
00:47:52,270 --> 00:47:55,000
and when you're doing
this on your podcast,

1354
00:47:55,001 --> 00:47:55,271
well I'm,

1355
00:47:55,271 --> 00:47:57,580
one of the beautiful
things about that is that,

1356
00:47:57,610 --> 00:47:58,121
you know,

1357
00:47:58,121 --> 00:48:01,180
you can explore these ideas
without commercial breaks.

1358
00:48:01,181 --> 00:48:04,180
You don't have to have anybody
telling you what to do.

1359
00:48:04,181 --> 00:48:05,014
You could just,

1360
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:06,640
whatever's interesting to you.

1361
00:48:06,641 --> 00:48:09,550
Is that how you pick the subjects and
the people that you're talking to?

1362
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:10,350
Yeah.

1363
00:48:10,350 --> 00:48:11,630
Like this week I,

1364
00:48:11,790 --> 00:48:15,930
I had on Pam Meyers
who wrote lie spotting,

1365
00:48:16,580 --> 00:48:17,530
I spend a lot of motherfuckers,

1366
00:48:17,570 --> 00:48:20,240
is that a book on liars by spotting?

1367
00:48:20,350 --> 00:48:20,850
Yeah.

1368
00:48:20,850 --> 00:48:25,750
And I spent a lot of my
career on deception detection
because I spent a lot of

1369
00:48:25,751 --> 00:48:27,370
time in the litigation arena,

1370
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:28,090
uh,

1371
00:48:28,090 --> 00:48:29,460
on interrogation technique.

1372
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:30,400
Cause that's how you met over,

1373
00:48:30,401 --> 00:48:30,940
right?

1374
00:48:30,940 --> 00:48:31,720
Yeah,

1375
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:32,230
yeah.

1376
00:48:32,230 --> 00:48:33,310
That was when she was doing that.

1377
00:48:33,311 --> 00:48:33,441
Uh,

1378
00:48:33,441 --> 00:48:33,640
the,

1379
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:35,350
the beef industry was sooner.

1380
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:35,561
Yeah.

1381
00:48:35,561 --> 00:48:37,180
The mad cow case in Amarillo,

1382
00:48:37,270 --> 00:48:37,780
Eh,

1383
00:48:37,780 --> 00:48:38,613
yeah.

1384
00:48:38,850 --> 00:48:41,690
She got sued for a couple
of billion dollars and um,

1385
00:48:42,410 --> 00:48:42,591
uh,

1386
00:48:42,591 --> 00:48:44,150
represented her in that case.

1387
00:48:44,151 --> 00:48:44,510
And that's,

1388
00:48:44,510 --> 00:48:45,343
that's how we met.

1389
00:48:46,420 --> 00:48:47,100
And so,

1390
00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:47,361
I mean,

1391
00:48:47,361 --> 00:48:52,361
I had Pam on and we've both worked
a lot in deception detection and

1392
00:48:52,641 --> 00:48:54,380
interrogation techniques and stuff.

1393
00:48:54,381 --> 00:48:55,880
And so just,

1394
00:48:56,420 --> 00:48:58,460
and it came right at a time when,

1395
00:48:59,060 --> 00:49:02,800
you know Jesse Smollett
is in the news about it.

1396
00:49:02,801 --> 00:49:03,800
Is he telling the truth?

1397
00:49:03,801 --> 00:49:04,850
Was he not telling the truth?

1398
00:49:04,851 --> 00:49:06,380
And in here we have this conversation.

1399
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:08,850
What did you think immediately
when you heard that story?

1400
00:49:09,070 --> 00:49:09,280
Uh,

1401
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:11,140
I was very suspicious
when I heard this story.

1402
00:49:11,430 --> 00:49:12,091
Jamie and I,

1403
00:49:12,091 --> 00:49:13,770
we shut that once the cameras are off,

1404
00:49:13,771 --> 00:49:14,850
we're leg these off.

1405
00:49:15,150 --> 00:49:16,130
Fuck that guy.

1406
00:49:16,131 --> 00:49:17,090
That he's real,

1407
00:49:17,180 --> 00:49:18,730
that nobody does this.

1408
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:21,300
It was just too much like a movie.

1409
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:22,501
Yeah.

1410
00:49:22,501 --> 00:49:24,120
It was a bad movie.

1411
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:25,433
Yeah.

1412
00:49:26,430 --> 00:49:31,430
It's nine below zero and two people are
lying and white just in hopes that he

1413
00:49:31,501 --> 00:49:32,730
might come by

1414
00:49:32,930 --> 00:49:33,460
who I am.

1415
00:49:33,460 --> 00:49:33,670
Yeah.

1416
00:49:33,670 --> 00:49:34,503
I mean,

1417
00:49:35,220 --> 00:49:35,840
uh,

1418
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:36,950
so strange.

1419
00:49:36,980 --> 00:49:37,261
Yeah,

1420
00:49:37,261 --> 00:49:37,590
it,

1421
00:49:37,590 --> 00:49:39,830
it was suspicious and you know,

1422
00:49:39,831 --> 00:49:43,040
he's entitled to due process
and he's going to get it.

1423
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:43,881
Yeah.

1424
00:49:43,881 --> 00:49:44,720
He's going to get it.

1425
00:49:44,970 --> 00:49:45,561
And now he's saying,

1426
00:49:45,561 --> 00:49:45,831
yes,

1427
00:49:45,831 --> 00:49:47,750
I'm a untreated drug problem.

1428
00:49:47,990 --> 00:49:52,990
So he's trying to carve out some
path to explain his bizarre behavior.

1429
00:49:53,820 --> 00:49:54,150
But

1430
00:49:54,150 --> 00:49:55,170
there are very,

1431
00:49:55,680 --> 00:50:00,390
there are very specific
lie behaviors that people

1432
00:50:02,250 --> 00:50:03,540
can't really control.

1433
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:04,650
Like what kind of stuff?

1434
00:50:05,070 --> 00:50:05,903
Well,

1435
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:07,440
for example,

1436
00:50:08,510 --> 00:50:09,120
when,

1437
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:14,120
when people are really desperately trying
to convince you they're telling the

1438
00:50:14,491 --> 00:50:15,324
truth,

1439
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:19,830
they'll do a lot of times what
are called convincing statements.

1440
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:21,553
Um,

1441
00:50:21,570 --> 00:50:24,990
rather than just telling you
what they did or didn't do,

1442
00:50:25,020 --> 00:50:26,280
they'll do convincing statements.

1443
00:50:26,281 --> 00:50:27,114
Like,

1444
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:28,310
you know me,

1445
00:50:28,370 --> 00:50:29,440
ah,

1446
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:30,271
like somebody saying,

1447
00:50:30,271 --> 00:50:30,860
who's who?

1448
00:50:30,860 --> 00:50:32,990
Somebody stole the petty
cash in the office.

1449
00:50:33,710 --> 00:50:34,251
You know,

1450
00:50:34,251 --> 00:50:34,700
me,

1451
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:35,870
I give more money.

1452
00:50:35,930 --> 00:50:38,570
I donate more money
than was stolen yearly.

1453
00:50:38,571 --> 00:50:39,710
You guys know me.

1454
00:50:39,711 --> 00:50:40,544
I mean,

1455
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:43,640
I was employee of the week,

1456
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:45,340
you know,

1457
00:50:45,340 --> 00:50:48,260
there this convincing
you that is a nice guy.

1458
00:50:48,770 --> 00:50:49,960
And then they'll say,

1459
00:50:50,070 --> 00:50:50,661
when someone does,

1460
00:50:50,661 --> 00:50:53,840
if they're wrongly accused and know when
someone gives with the wrongly accused

1461
00:50:54,060 --> 00:50:55,670
you of the wrongly accused,

1462
00:50:55,820 --> 00:51:00,470
they'll look you straight up in the
eye and tell you I didn't do it.

1463
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:01,580
And if you ask them,

1464
00:51:02,180 --> 00:51:04,520
what do you think should
happen to somebody that did,

1465
00:51:05,660 --> 00:51:07,190
an innocent person will say,

1466
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,140
I think they should be found.

1467
00:51:09,141 --> 00:51:12,350
I think it should be held fully
accountable to the extent of the law.

1468
00:51:12,890 --> 00:51:14,030
Somebody that's guilty will say,

1469
00:51:14,031 --> 00:51:14,600
well,

1470
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:15,021
you know,

1471
00:51:15,021 --> 00:51:15,801
I don't know.

1472
00:51:15,801 --> 00:51:16,131
I mean,

1473
00:51:16,131 --> 00:51:17,320
people make mistakes.

1474
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:17,720
Yeah.

1475
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:18,553
You know,

1476
00:51:18,710 --> 00:51:20,240
you got to give a guy a second chance.

1477
00:51:20,930 --> 00:51:25,930
Do you worry that in coaching that you're
essentially coaching liars by telling

1478
00:51:26,271 --> 00:51:28,640
people this kind of stuff and
someone who does steal the money,

1479
00:51:29,030 --> 00:51:29,440
you know,

1480
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:31,220
would be able to kind of like,

1481
00:51:31,221 --> 00:51:31,671
Hey,

1482
00:51:31,671 --> 00:51:32,504
uh,

1483
00:51:32,750 --> 00:51:34,130
it's not for amateurs.

1484
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:34,560
And,

1485
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:35,030
uh,

1486
00:51:35,030 --> 00:51:35,863
and um,

1487
00:51:36,620 --> 00:51:37,453
when you,

1488
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:42,520
there were some things that you
can tell people to watch for,

1489
00:51:42,590 --> 00:51:47,590
but one of the things you do if there's
somebody that you suspect is you

1490
00:51:48,081 --> 00:51:52,640
increase their cognitive load during
the interrogation and there's no way you

1491
00:51:52,641 --> 00:51:53,720
can prepare for that.

1492
00:51:53,810 --> 00:51:54,030
Oh,

1493
00:51:54,030 --> 00:51:54,863
how'd you do that?

1494
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:56,233
Well,

1495
00:51:56,920 --> 00:51:57,753
um,

1496
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:00,200
you plan a mind virus,

1497
00:52:00,201 --> 00:52:01,100
for example,

1498
00:52:01,101 --> 00:52:02,120
a mind virus.

1499
00:52:02,180 --> 00:52:03,370
Oh yeah.

1500
00:52:03,810 --> 00:52:05,570
This is a Perry Mason type shit.

1501
00:52:05,810 --> 00:52:06,280
Yeah.

1502
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:07,113
Like when he did,

1503
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:10,113
like,

1504
00:52:11,070 --> 00:52:11,720
if,

1505
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:13,160
let's pretend some money's missing,

1506
00:52:13,550 --> 00:52:14,600
if I said to you,

1507
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:15,993
um,

1508
00:52:16,370 --> 00:52:21,370
is there any reason somebody would have
told me that they saw you near a cashbox

1509
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:24,200
about the time it went missing?

1510
00:52:24,830 --> 00:52:25,270
Dumped,

1511
00:52:25,270 --> 00:52:26,103
dumped down.

1512
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:27,711
Okay.

1513
00:52:27,711 --> 00:52:30,830
Now people talk at 125 words a minute.

1514
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:34,400
They think at 12 to 1400 words a minute.

1515
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:36,141
Now,

1516
00:52:36,141 --> 00:52:37,160
if it takes you five,

1517
00:52:37,610 --> 00:52:39,380
five seconds to tell me no,

1518
00:52:41,060 --> 00:52:42,140
you took the money.

1519
00:52:44,570 --> 00:52:46,280
Because if you weren't from his right now,

1520
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:48,410
if you didn't take it,

1521
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:50,720
you know you didn't take it.

1522
00:52:50,721 --> 00:52:54,140
You don't need to run scenarios through
your head to think who could have seen

1523
00:52:54,141 --> 00:52:55,440
me been.

1524
00:52:55,510 --> 00:52:57,330
I mean it was it.

1525
00:52:58,460 --> 00:52:59,570
I didn't see anybody.

1526
00:52:59,571 --> 00:53:01,100
Nobody could have seen me what did it.

1527
00:53:01,910 --> 00:53:03,140
But if you didn't do it,

1528
00:53:03,650 --> 00:53:08,120
it doesn't take you one
millisecond to say absolutely not.

1529
00:53:08,690 --> 00:53:09,860
Have you ever been wrong before?

1530
00:53:09,861 --> 00:53:11,420
And when you see someone
on television and go,

1531
00:53:11,421 --> 00:53:14,440
I think that guy's guilty and
they're innocent or vice verse.

1532
00:53:15,110 --> 00:53:16,100
Oh sure.

1533
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:17,000
Because if,

1534
00:53:17,020 --> 00:53:22,020
if you really want to know for sure
if somebody is guilty or innocent,

1535
00:53:22,610 --> 00:53:24,590
you need to invest a lot of time.

1536
00:53:24,591 --> 00:53:27,690
You need to get a baseline of
what they normally look like,

1537
00:53:28,470 --> 00:53:29,161
talk like,

1538
00:53:29,161 --> 00:53:29,994
feel like,

1539
00:53:30,510 --> 00:53:31,260
um,

1540
00:53:31,260 --> 00:53:31,800
and NBA.

1541
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:33,690
And then knowing that baseline,

1542
00:53:33,691 --> 00:53:36,720
you then need to compare
how they're behaving on TV.

1543
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:40,080
So just walking by the
screen and seeing it,

1544
00:53:40,170 --> 00:53:41,003
um,

1545
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:45,600
you might see things that would ordinarily
be lie behaviors that could just be

1546
00:53:45,601 --> 00:53:46,770
part of their personality.

1547
00:53:46,771 --> 00:53:49,770
So if you're going to
really make a judgment,

1548
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:50,690
uh,

1549
00:53:50,690 --> 00:53:50,931
you,

1550
00:53:50,931 --> 00:53:53,970
you got to put a lot of
time in and figure it out.

1551
00:53:53,971 --> 00:53:58,971
And what you should do before you decide
you're going to be a human lie detector

1552
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:03,510
is do your homework and y'all tried to
figure it out objectively before you

1553
00:54:03,511 --> 00:54:04,830
figure it out behaviorally.

1554
00:54:05,010 --> 00:54:05,251
I mean,

1555
00:54:05,251 --> 00:54:07,200
you ought of do your investigation,

1556
00:54:07,201 --> 00:54:11,060
find out if somebody took
the money and you know,

1557
00:54:11,190 --> 00:54:13,710
find out where they were and you know,

1558
00:54:13,711 --> 00:54:16,200
look for fingerprints
and do this and do that.

1559
00:54:16,220 --> 00:54:16,381
I mean,

1560
00:54:16,381 --> 00:54:21,381
you ought to really objectively figure
it out before you rely on these things.

1561
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:27,320
And so unless you get a baseline and get
one on one with them and spend a lot of

1562
00:54:29,311 --> 00:54:30,144
time,

1563
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:32,220
then you can't be,

1564
00:54:32,630 --> 00:54:36,060
you can't be really certain that you know,

1565
00:54:36,061 --> 00:54:38,150
whether they're telling the
truth or whether or not it's,

1566
00:54:38,210 --> 00:54:43,210
it would be fun if it was that easy and
that some people are pretty obvious.

1567
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:43,730
Yeah.

1568
00:54:43,730 --> 00:54:48,730
I heard a cop once say that when people
are guilty they tend to plead and cry

1569
00:54:50,670 --> 00:54:54,120
and then when they're not guilty they
tend to get angry when they're accused.

1570
00:54:54,660 --> 00:54:57,150
People that are wrongly
accused are generally,

1571
00:54:57,151 --> 00:54:59,460
I write from the beginning till the end.

1572
00:55:00,180 --> 00:55:01,380
I mean the,

1573
00:55:01,410 --> 00:55:02,640
every case is different,

1574
00:55:03,420 --> 00:55:08,250
but if you're wrongly accused that
person is going to be pissed off from the

1575
00:55:08,250 --> 00:55:11,400
minute you accused him till
the end because it's like,

1576
00:55:12,210 --> 00:55:12,700
um,

1577
00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:13,270
their self.

1578
00:55:13,270 --> 00:55:13,921
Raj is like,

1579
00:55:13,921 --> 00:55:14,220
I,

1580
00:55:14,220 --> 00:55:17,860
I didn't do this and you're
saying I did and screw you.

1581
00:55:19,050 --> 00:55:21,060
And they don't take a step back.

1582
00:55:21,210 --> 00:55:23,190
And when you,

1583
00:55:24,090 --> 00:55:25,410
you see people,

1584
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:29,730
they knew these convincing statements
and they're pleading for you to believe

1585
00:55:29,731 --> 00:55:29,971
them.

1586
00:55:29,971 --> 00:55:34,971
And then an anytime somebody
says now in all honesty,

1587
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:41,600
usually the next thing
out of their mass ally,

1588
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:44,960
like I said to you now,

1589
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:46,580
now Joe,

1590
00:55:46,581 --> 00:55:47,414
honestly,

1591
00:55:47,450 --> 00:55:49,490
as opposed to everything
else you've been telling me,

1592
00:55:50,110 --> 00:55:53,020
why are we we bracketing
this one out is honest.

1593
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:56,570
Or if they invoke the Deity,

1594
00:55:57,170 --> 00:55:58,003
oh,

1595
00:55:58,130 --> 00:56:00,440
I swear to God,

1596
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:02,690
God as my witness.

1597
00:56:03,740 --> 00:56:05,150
And you know,

1598
00:56:05,180 --> 00:56:10,180
I don't know whether I have not done
what I said you need to do with Jesse

1599
00:56:11,270 --> 00:56:12,103
Smollett.

1600
00:56:12,140 --> 00:56:15,380
But I do know when he
went to the set at Fox,

1601
00:56:16,390 --> 00:56:17,060
uh,

1602
00:56:17,060 --> 00:56:18,080
he said,

1603
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:20,600
you all know me.

1604
00:56:22,450 --> 00:56:23,283
I swear,

1605
00:56:23,350 --> 00:56:24,183
God,

1606
00:56:24,730 --> 00:56:25,780
I didn't do this.

1607
00:56:27,730 --> 00:56:28,570
And I mean,

1608
00:56:28,571 --> 00:56:31,720
there were like three or four of those
kinds of statements in like two or three

1609
00:56:31,721 --> 00:56:32,650
sentences there.

1610
00:56:32,750 --> 00:56:32,901
Well,

1611
00:56:32,901 --> 00:56:33,800
my favorite ones,

1612
00:56:33,801 --> 00:56:34,521
he's on stage.

1613
00:56:34,521 --> 00:56:36,020
He called himself the gay Tupac.

1614
00:56:36,710 --> 00:56:37,580
That's enough for me.

1615
00:56:38,270 --> 00:56:39,530
That's a little narcissistic.

1616
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:44,660
It's a strange thing though.

1617
00:56:44,661 --> 00:56:45,980
Like there was another one today,

1618
00:56:45,990 --> 00:56:50,990
a guy a lit his house on fire
and think a in Chicago and uh,

1619
00:56:51,590 --> 00:56:51,930
said,

1620
00:56:51,930 --> 00:56:52,460
uh,

1621
00:56:52,460 --> 00:56:53,360
he's a gay fella,

1622
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:56,330
said it was a hate crime
and they caught him.

1623
00:56:57,390 --> 00:56:58,550
So a lot of that going on,

1624
00:56:58,700 --> 00:56:59,533
you know,

1625
00:57:00,020 --> 00:57:00,920
a lot of fake crime.

1626
00:57:01,610 --> 00:57:02,480
Very strange.

1627
00:57:02,481 --> 00:57:02,641
The,

1628
00:57:02,641 --> 00:57:03,270
the,

1629
00:57:03,270 --> 00:57:07,580
and then sometimes people accuse people
of something and someone will say,

1630
00:57:07,770 --> 00:57:08,330
why would,

1631
00:57:08,330 --> 00:57:09,790
why would someone make something out?

1632
00:57:09,791 --> 00:57:11,520
Why would someone turned
themselves into a victim?

1633
00:57:11,521 --> 00:57:13,700
What there think there's a lot
of clout and being a victim,

1634
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:15,230
especially today,

1635
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:16,220
there's a lot of,

1636
00:57:16,220 --> 00:57:17,330
you get a lot of attention,

1637
00:57:17,350 --> 00:57:18,200
a lot of love.

1638
00:57:18,290 --> 00:57:23,290
I think there's a lot of false accusations
and false attacks and it's a lot of

1639
00:57:23,691 --> 00:57:24,524
real ones.

1640
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:25,191
But man,

1641
00:57:25,191 --> 00:57:26,380
when the false ones calm,

1642
00:57:26,381 --> 00:57:28,760
but it just does a giant
disservice to everybody.

1643
00:57:28,830 --> 00:57:28,951
Well,

1644
00:57:28,951 --> 00:57:33,951
there's a fair amount of research
as to why people do these hoaxes and

1645
00:57:34,950 --> 00:57:39,090
particularly hate crime hoaxes
and one of the primary motivation,

1646
00:57:39,091 --> 00:57:39,421
of course,

1647
00:57:39,421 --> 00:57:41,310
it's sympathy and attention and all that,

1648
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:47,240
but one of the interesting reasons
that I've read in research is that they

1649
00:57:48,001 --> 00:57:52,740
really feel like it's emblematic of
how the system treats them overall.

1650
00:57:53,340 --> 00:57:58,340
This is just a dramatic example of it
and they feel like I'm treated this way

1651
00:57:58,531 --> 00:57:59,340
anyhow.

1652
00:57:59,340 --> 00:58:00,150
Ah,

1653
00:58:00,150 --> 00:58:00,983
so they'd just,

1654
00:58:01,150 --> 00:58:02,850
I'm discriminated against,

1655
00:58:02,851 --> 00:58:04,140
I suffer by us,

1656
00:58:04,141 --> 00:58:05,220
I'm put down.

1657
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:09,120
This is just a focused example of that.

1658
00:58:09,121 --> 00:58:11,130
So I'm really not lying.

1659
00:58:11,131 --> 00:58:14,280
I'm just role playing
how I'm overall treated.

1660
00:58:14,370 --> 00:58:15,270
Oh Wow.

1661
00:58:15,420 --> 00:58:20,160
So they justified in their mind of their
disc going to bring all this treatment

1662
00:58:20,161 --> 00:58:23,220
into one example to bring it into focus.

1663
00:58:23,970 --> 00:58:26,970
And so while it's a phony deal,

1664
00:58:26,971 --> 00:58:31,780
it really is truthful representation
of what their life is really likely

1665
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:33,120
justified in that way.

1666
00:58:33,210 --> 00:58:33,541
Oh,

1667
00:58:33,541 --> 00:58:34,374
how weird.

1668
00:58:34,820 --> 00:58:35,640
That's,

1669
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:35,950
yeah,

1670
00:58:35,950 --> 00:58:38,110
that's a deep psychological shit.

1671
00:58:38,610 --> 00:58:38,940
Yeah.

1672
00:58:38,940 --> 00:58:39,290
That's,

1673
00:58:39,290 --> 00:58:39,700
uh,

1674
00:58:39,700 --> 00:58:40,550
that's stretching.

1675
00:58:41,610 --> 00:58:42,480
That's a weird one.

1676
00:58:42,481 --> 00:58:43,314
We liked

1677
00:58:43,540 --> 00:58:45,210
you ride it out like that.

1678
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:46,680
Put it in your mind that way.

1679
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:47,520
Yeah.

1680
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:48,353
Wow.

1681
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:49,680
It's,

1682
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:51,600
it's strange too because
it gives people this,

1683
00:58:51,601 --> 00:58:52,420
um,

1684
00:58:52,420 --> 00:58:52,700
this,

1685
00:58:52,700 --> 00:58:52,921
this,

1686
00:58:52,921 --> 00:58:53,131
this,

1687
00:58:53,131 --> 00:58:55,770
this giant public show to watch now.

1688
00:58:55,980 --> 00:58:56,730
Yeah.

1689
00:58:56,730 --> 00:58:57,070
Yeah.

1690
00:58:57,070 --> 00:58:57,920
I hate that family.

1691
00:58:58,070 --> 00:58:59,960
What a talented young man.

1692
00:58:59,961 --> 00:59:00,470
I mean,

1693
00:59:00,470 --> 00:59:01,060
is he,

1694
00:59:01,060 --> 00:59:01,390
he's,

1695
00:59:01,390 --> 00:59:03,530
I've the Times that I've seen,

1696
00:59:03,531 --> 00:59:04,520
I don't want to show a lot,

1697
00:59:04,521 --> 00:59:09,521
but the times I've seen him on there
singing and assuming it is his voice and

1698
00:59:09,951 --> 00:59:10,784
he's singing,

1699
00:59:11,150 --> 00:59:11,983
uh,

1700
00:59:12,290 --> 00:59:14,150
extremely talented young man,

1701
00:59:14,450 --> 00:59:17,000
I find a lot of talented
people are fucking crazy.

1702
00:59:18,020 --> 00:59:18,620
Well,

1703
00:59:18,620 --> 00:59:18,771
you know,

1704
00:59:18,771 --> 00:59:20,870
somebody said that somebody,

1705
00:59:22,220 --> 00:59:26,420
the really talented singers and actors
were the weird kids from high school that

1706
00:59:26,421 --> 00:59:27,710
were in drama and all that stuff.

1707
00:59:27,870 --> 00:59:28,081
Oh,

1708
00:59:28,081 --> 00:59:28,914
for sure.

1709
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:30,040
For sure.

1710
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:30,873
No.

1711
00:59:31,170 --> 00:59:31,680
Um,

1712
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:32,820
various levels of crazy.

1713
00:59:32,821 --> 00:59:34,170
Obviously not all deceptive,

1714
00:59:34,171 --> 00:59:35,010
but you know,

1715
00:59:35,190 --> 00:59:38,400
some of the most brilliant actors are
just completely out of their mind.

1716
00:59:38,401 --> 00:59:41,100
And that's one of the reasons why they're
so good at acting because they can

1717
00:59:41,430 --> 00:59:42,251
look a,

1718
00:59:42,251 --> 00:59:45,890
my frame wet and my friend Wayne
Fetterman had a a bit they did about it on

1719
00:59:45,891 --> 00:59:47,130
stage and he's like,

1720
00:59:47,131 --> 00:59:47,730
guess what?

1721
00:59:47,730 --> 00:59:50,820
It's not fucking normal
to be able to just cry.

1722
00:59:51,510 --> 00:59:51,811
He goes,

1723
00:59:51,811 --> 00:59:54,890
you could just cry and pretend
something's wrong and cries.

1724
00:59:54,910 --> 00:59:55,050
I,

1725
00:59:55,050 --> 00:59:56,010
that's crazy.

1726
00:59:56,011 --> 00:59:57,270
These are crazy people.

1727
00:59:57,550 --> 00:59:58,190
Yeah.

1728
00:59:58,190 --> 01:00:01,460
And you really can't
go to a certain place.

1729
01:00:01,470 --> 01:00:01,840
You've,

1730
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:03,800
you don't have a little of that in you.

1731
01:00:05,470 --> 01:00:08,130
My Dad used to always say when
he's working with patients,

1732
01:00:08,131 --> 01:00:10,120
you'd would say something about that.

1733
01:00:10,121 --> 01:00:10,481
Oh boy,

1734
01:00:10,481 --> 01:00:11,830
I can't stand about me.

1735
01:00:12,870 --> 01:00:16,330
Cause you say you can't see it in them
if you don't have a little evidence in

1736
01:00:16,331 --> 01:00:17,164
you.

1737
01:00:17,510 --> 01:00:18,690
I think there's some truth,

1738
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:20,320
there's 100% truth and that,

1739
01:00:20,321 --> 01:00:22,960
that is a thing that tries me
the craziest about weak people.

1740
01:00:23,290 --> 01:00:25,620
I'm so terrified of seeing weakness and,

1741
01:00:25,621 --> 01:00:25,781
and,

1742
01:00:25,781 --> 01:00:26,614
and just,

1743
01:00:27,250 --> 01:00:28,083
just,

1744
01:00:28,150 --> 01:00:28,810
just,

1745
01:00:28,810 --> 01:00:30,100
just being pathetic.

1746
01:00:30,130 --> 01:00:31,990
I'm so terrified to seeing that in myself.

1747
01:00:31,991 --> 01:00:33,280
I see it in other people and it just,

1748
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:34,301
it smells,

1749
01:00:34,301 --> 01:00:36,280
I smelled like a drug sniffing dog.

1750
01:00:36,580 --> 01:00:36,941
Oh,

1751
01:00:36,941 --> 01:00:37,774
there it is.

1752
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:38,111
Yeah.

1753
01:00:38,111 --> 01:00:39,520
You smell desperation.

1754
01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:40,460
Yes.

1755
01:00:40,630 --> 01:00:41,980
What makes you do this?

1756
01:00:41,981 --> 01:00:43,150
Why are you doing a podcast?

1757
01:00:43,510 --> 01:00:45,280
I have always been a blabber mouth.

1758
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:46,750
I can never shut the fuck up.

1759
01:00:46,840 --> 01:00:47,740
I love talk and,

1760
01:00:47,741 --> 01:00:48,340
and uh,

1761
01:00:48,340 --> 01:00:52,810
I've always been fascinated by human
beings and their lives and just talking to

1762
01:00:52,811 --> 01:00:57,400
people and finding out like the guy
before was this guy yo on Grillo,

1763
01:00:57,401 --> 01:00:57,890
who's a,

1764
01:00:57,890 --> 01:00:59,500
a a narcotics,

1765
01:00:59,501 --> 01:01:00,370
a journalist.

1766
01:01:00,550 --> 01:01:03,100
He's a narco journalists in Mexico.

1767
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:04,151
I mean,

1768
01:01:04,151 --> 01:01:05,410
I couldn't wait to talk to that guy.

1769
01:01:06,010 --> 01:01:06,181
I mean,

1770
01:01:06,181 --> 01:01:07,690
just what a life.

1771
01:01:07,691 --> 01:01:09,550
And He's been living
in Mexico for 18 years.

1772
01:01:09,551 --> 01:01:10,384
He's from England.

1773
01:01:10,660 --> 01:01:12,040
I still alive.

1774
01:01:12,060 --> 01:01:13,930
So that's something right there.

1775
01:01:14,050 --> 01:01:14,321
Yeah.

1776
01:01:14,321 --> 01:01:14,711
And He,

1777
01:01:14,711 --> 01:01:14,891
you know,

1778
01:01:14,891 --> 01:01:17,500
he's telling me about friends that
have been killed and you know,

1779
01:01:17,501 --> 01:01:19,990
he's been in some sticky
situations a few times and,

1780
01:01:19,991 --> 01:01:20,460
you know,

1781
01:01:20,460 --> 01:01:21,160
um,

1782
01:01:21,160 --> 01:01:26,110
I'm just fascinated by pit by
people and what they liked to do.

1783
01:01:26,260 --> 01:01:26,651
You know,

1784
01:01:26,651 --> 01:01:29,950
I'm fascinated by athletes
and fascinated by physicists.

1785
01:01:30,490 --> 01:01:30,821
I,

1786
01:01:30,821 --> 01:01:31,210
uh,

1787
01:01:31,210 --> 01:01:32,410
I've just always been very,

1788
01:01:32,411 --> 01:01:34,180
very curious and um,

1789
01:01:34,210 --> 01:01:37,250
I've always recognized that everyone
thinks about things differently.

1790
01:01:37,251 --> 01:01:39,340
And then I could take a little
bit of something from everybody,

1791
01:01:39,670 --> 01:01:43,060
whether it's from a book or it's from
having a conversation with someone,

1792
01:01:43,061 --> 01:01:44,360
I can gain a little bit of,

1793
01:01:45,010 --> 01:01:46,270
a little bit of experience,

1794
01:01:46,271 --> 01:01:47,200
a little bit of knowledge,

1795
01:01:47,260 --> 01:01:48,670
a little bit of insight.

1796
01:01:49,540 --> 01:01:49,691
Yeah.

1797
01:01:49,691 --> 01:01:54,691
You're naturally very curious because
I listened to you interviews and you're

1798
01:01:54,791 --> 01:01:56,170
naturally very curious.

1799
01:01:56,171 --> 01:01:59,980
You don't struggle for the next
question because you really want to know

1800
01:01:59,981 --> 01:02:01,780
something that makes it much easier.

1801
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,570
Does very lucky that I found this very,

1802
01:02:04,580 --> 01:02:06,350
just stumbled into doing
this kind of Shannon,

1803
01:02:06,351 --> 01:02:08,360
why wasn't this way in the
beginning and the big beginning,

1804
01:02:08,361 --> 01:02:10,520
it was just horse
shitting with friends and,

1805
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:12,530
and slowly but surely as the pot,

1806
01:02:12,560 --> 01:02:14,150
the podcast became popular.

1807
01:02:14,151 --> 01:02:14,451
I was like,

1808
01:02:14,451 --> 01:02:17,660
I wonder if that guy would talk to me and
then I would get people on and then it

1809
01:02:17,661 --> 01:02:22,661
became more these long form
interesting conversations.

1810
01:02:23,230 --> 01:02:24,063
Yeah.

1811
01:02:24,630 --> 01:02:25,060
Yeah.

1812
01:02:25,060 --> 01:02:27,900
If you're curious about
human functioning at all,

1813
01:02:27,901 --> 01:02:29,100
human nature at all,

1814
01:02:29,190 --> 01:02:32,080
there's an endless menu of
things you can talk about.

1815
01:02:32,081 --> 01:02:33,270
And I don't care who it is.

1816
01:02:33,450 --> 01:02:33,780
You could,

1817
01:02:33,780 --> 01:02:37,410
you could pull somebody out of a car
on the street and if you're curious,

1818
01:02:37,411 --> 01:02:40,260
you can talk to him because everybody
has a different take in life.

1819
01:02:40,261 --> 01:02:41,610
Everybody has a different walk.

1820
01:02:41,840 --> 01:02:42,111
Yeah,

1821
01:02:42,111 --> 01:02:42,741
absolutely.

1822
01:02:42,741 --> 01:02:43,790
And what you're talking about,

1823
01:02:43,970 --> 01:02:45,740
you're interviewing all these athletes,

1824
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:46,511
you know,

1825
01:02:46,511 --> 01:02:46,760
um,

1826
01:02:46,760 --> 01:02:51,560
I think people tend to write off athletic
pursuits as being entirely physical

1827
01:02:51,890 --> 01:02:52,880
and they are not,

1828
01:02:53,270 --> 01:02:57,830
I mean I think this is an easy way for
people to look at it that don't engage or

1829
01:02:57,831 --> 01:03:02,831
they've never really thought about playing
anything at a very high level that it

1830
01:03:03,021 --> 01:03:05,300
requires some intense thinking.

1831
01:03:05,330 --> 01:03:09,620
It might not require mathematics
or a large vocabulary,

1832
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:12,380
but understanding what's required,

1833
01:03:12,410 --> 01:03:14,540
understanding when and how to execute,

1834
01:03:14,541 --> 01:03:17,060
understanding how to keep your
shit together under pressure.

1835
01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:22,360
Those are all intensely intellectual
aspects of any really high end athletic

1836
01:03:23,031 --> 01:03:23,864
pursuit.

1837
01:03:23,900 --> 01:03:26,360
And there's a different breed of cat that

1838
01:03:26,490 --> 01:03:29,160
he wants the ball with the buzzer and it,

1839
01:03:29,330 --> 01:03:30,720
it's not just a show boat.

1840
01:03:30,750 --> 01:03:32,190
There's a different breed of cat

1841
01:03:32,440 --> 01:03:34,000
once that ball at that point,

1842
01:03:35,290 --> 01:03:38,230
and it's not always who you think,

1843
01:03:38,231 --> 01:03:42,970
but it takes a special kind of
person that wants that pressure,

1844
01:03:43,570 --> 01:03:45,880
that knows they can handle
it better than anybody else.

1845
01:03:45,940 --> 01:03:46,450
Yeah.

1846
01:03:46,450 --> 01:03:46,691
You know,

1847
01:03:46,691 --> 01:03:49,960
and it's a lot of times it's people
that are entirely confident that they've

1848
01:03:49,961 --> 01:03:50,794
done the work.

1849
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:55,240
You know there's a haunting thing that
happens with athletes where you're not

1850
01:03:55,241 --> 01:03:56,440
sure if you did enough.

1851
01:03:56,441 --> 01:04:01,441
And in fighters it's a very dangerous
inclination because it leads you to

1852
01:04:01,511 --> 01:04:06,430
overtrain and you have to be very careful
about that because with a fighter you

1853
01:04:06,431 --> 01:04:08,920
only can learn so much
during your training camp.

1854
01:04:08,921 --> 01:04:10,750
Like say once you get into training camp,

1855
01:04:10,751 --> 01:04:12,700
you got eight weeks
depending on who you are.

1856
01:04:12,701 --> 01:04:14,080
Some guys like to do a little longer,

1857
01:04:14,380 --> 01:04:17,530
but the average is maybe
eight 12 weeks is a long camp.

1858
01:04:18,310 --> 01:04:21,490
You already have to know how to
fight by the time you get to camp.

1859
01:04:21,640 --> 01:04:26,560
So what you're really doing is just kind
of working on specific movements where

1860
01:04:26,561 --> 01:04:30,670
you're dealing with one kind of fighter
and then getting your body in shape,

1861
01:04:30,850 --> 01:04:33,250
getting your body condition
to getting your mind ready,

1862
01:04:33,310 --> 01:04:34,390
preparing everything,

1863
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:35,950
cutting your body weight down,

1864
01:04:35,951 --> 01:04:40,090
getting so you can weigh in
and have a a good amount of,

1865
01:04:40,091 --> 01:04:40,924
um,

1866
01:04:41,020 --> 01:04:41,290
just,

1867
01:04:41,290 --> 01:04:41,870
it's just,

1868
01:04:41,870 --> 01:04:43,390
you gotta have enough vitality,

1869
01:04:43,391 --> 01:04:44,500
can't drain yourself.

1870
01:04:44,501 --> 01:04:49,501
So this is this complicated dance that
goes on and that haunting thing of did I

1871
01:04:49,811 --> 01:04:50,600
do enough?

1872
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:54,300
It can cause fighters to screw
themselves over by overtraining.

1873
01:04:54,410 --> 01:04:54,760
Yeah.

1874
01:04:54,760 --> 01:04:59,760
So you have to have enough confidence to
know that you've done enough as well as

1875
01:05:00,491 --> 01:05:01,324
enough.

1876
01:05:01,450 --> 01:05:03,220
You have to know you've done enough.

1877
01:05:03,250 --> 01:05:03,641
But no,

1878
01:05:03,641 --> 01:05:04,990
you haven't done too much.

1879
01:05:05,140 --> 01:05:07,030
This is really strange dance,

1880
01:05:07,360 --> 01:05:07,631
you know,

1881
01:05:07,631 --> 01:05:07,931
and this,

1882
01:05:07,931 --> 01:05:08,350
uh,

1883
01:05:08,350 --> 01:05:08,770
this,

1884
01:05:08,770 --> 01:05:13,270
this weekend is a giant UFC big
UFC two big title fights between,

1885
01:05:13,271 --> 01:05:14,890
for the very best fighters in the world.

1886
01:05:15,250 --> 01:05:16,060
And um,

1887
01:05:16,060 --> 01:05:20,980
I mean that is one of the interesting
aspects of the fight game to me is one,

1888
01:05:20,981 --> 01:05:24,760
watching these guys stare each other down
at the way in where they get a look at

1889
01:05:24,761 --> 01:05:25,031
each other.

1890
01:05:25,031 --> 01:05:28,960
And they know 24 hours from now they're
going to war and just see like is there

1891
01:05:28,961 --> 01:05:31,300
a just us mellowed out?

1892
01:05:31,660 --> 01:05:32,620
Is there anything,

1893
01:05:32,680 --> 01:05:34,120
is there anything in there?

1894
01:05:34,660 --> 01:05:34,991
You know,

1895
01:05:34,991 --> 01:05:39,580
and just knowing that this is probably
one of the most difficult things in all

1896
01:05:39,581 --> 01:05:41,920
of athletics and that
these guys are going to,

1897
01:05:41,921 --> 01:05:42,754
uh,

1898
01:05:42,910 --> 01:05:43,360
they're,

1899
01:05:43,360 --> 01:05:47,620
they're going to apply their trade and
one of the most complicated things,

1900
01:05:47,621 --> 01:05:49,480
it's a battle of physical,

1901
01:05:49,660 --> 01:05:50,560
mental,

1902
01:05:50,770 --> 01:05:51,011
of,

1903
01:05:51,011 --> 01:05:52,270
of mindset,

1904
01:05:52,300 --> 01:05:53,230
of we'll,

1905
01:05:53,260 --> 01:05:55,480
of conditioning and discipline.

1906
01:05:56,080 --> 01:05:57,040
And then it's also,

1907
01:05:57,220 --> 01:05:59,170
there's a lot of random shit that happens.

1908
01:05:59,740 --> 01:06:04,210
Do you think if I can change at
William when people are looking at it?

1909
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:05,073
Yes.

1910
01:06:05,160 --> 01:06:05,993
Yes.

1911
01:06:06,360 --> 01:06:07,240
It can change.

1912
01:06:07,241 --> 01:06:08,320
It can shift right then.

1913
01:06:08,350 --> 01:06:09,820
It can't change forever by like,

1914
01:06:10,540 --> 01:06:12,310
you could look at John Jones sideways,

1915
01:06:12,311 --> 01:06:13,330
upside down.

1916
01:06:13,331 --> 01:06:14,440
You could stick your toe in.

1917
01:06:14,460 --> 01:06:16,150
Ain't gonna Affect Shit.

1918
01:06:16,180 --> 01:06:19,890
There's some guys that are just locked
down and bulletproof Jon Jones to pull it

1919
01:06:19,891 --> 01:06:20,200
proof.

1920
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:21,790
There's certain guys that
had just bulletproof.

1921
01:06:22,150 --> 01:06:23,290
They just look at you and like,

1922
01:06:23,291 --> 01:06:24,124
they know what to do.

1923
01:06:24,370 --> 01:06:25,690
There's a reason why he's undefeated,

1924
01:06:25,770 --> 01:06:26,020
you know?

1925
01:06:26,020 --> 01:06:26,680
He's just,

1926
01:06:26,680 --> 01:06:27,520
he knows how to do it,

1927
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:30,310
but then there's other guys that
like that may be like fucking,

1928
01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:33,760
maybe it's 80 20 maybe,

1929
01:06:33,761 --> 01:06:34,540
and then the,

1930
01:06:34,540 --> 01:06:37,180
the stare down your look at the
guy and you're looking at him like,

1931
01:06:37,181 --> 01:06:39,020
God damn and I'm fighting Yoel Romero.

1932
01:06:39,040 --> 01:06:40,360
How the fuck did this happen?

1933
01:06:40,361 --> 01:06:45,361
And then you see him drop down
to 75 maybe 73% confidence,

1934
01:06:46,001 --> 01:06:47,950
72 70 shit.

1935
01:06:48,460 --> 01:06:49,600
They look at his traps.

1936
01:06:49,601 --> 01:06:51,940
He's got a neck that starts at the
top of his head and you're like,

1937
01:06:51,941 --> 01:06:52,870
oh fuck.

1938
01:06:53,370 --> 01:06:53,680
You know,

1939
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:54,610
there's certain guys,

1940
01:06:54,611 --> 01:06:55,300
they're just,

1941
01:06:55,300 --> 01:06:57,340
they're intimidating at weigh ins too.

1942
01:06:57,740 --> 01:06:58,210
Yeah,

1943
01:06:58,210 --> 01:06:58,331
yeah.

1944
01:06:58,331 --> 01:06:59,380
It can change a little bit,

1945
01:06:59,381 --> 01:07:00,430
but not for everybody.

1946
01:07:00,431 --> 01:07:01,750
There's certain guys that just,

1947
01:07:02,350 --> 01:07:03,131
it doesn't matter.

1948
01:07:03,131 --> 01:07:04,090
You can't get in there.

1949
01:07:04,120 --> 01:07:06,520
There's certain champions
like real champions,

1950
01:07:06,521 --> 01:07:07,211
like mighty mouse,

1951
01:07:07,211 --> 01:07:07,721
Johnson.

1952
01:07:07,721 --> 01:07:11,260
There's a bunch of guys like
that that are just champions.

1953
01:07:11,320 --> 01:07:11,950
You look at them,

1954
01:07:11,950 --> 01:07:12,880
it doesn't matter.

1955
01:07:13,040 --> 01:07:13,410
They've,

1956
01:07:13,410 --> 01:07:14,410
they know what they're doing.

1957
01:07:14,411 --> 01:07:16,240
They've done the work that
the best in the business.

1958
01:07:16,570 --> 01:07:18,910
Like you can mean mug
them and get aggressive.

1959
01:07:18,911 --> 01:07:19,960
They might smile at you.

1960
01:07:20,260 --> 01:07:20,560
They might,

1961
01:07:20,560 --> 01:07:21,220
this is cute.

1962
01:07:21,220 --> 01:07:22,090
Tried to make me nervous.

1963
01:07:22,150 --> 01:07:22,983
Hilarious.

1964
01:07:23,170 --> 01:07:24,003
See You tomorrow.

1965
01:07:24,420 --> 01:07:25,253
Yeah.

1966
01:07:25,840 --> 01:07:30,840
So is that because they know who they
are and it doesn't matter who this is or

1967
01:07:33,431 --> 01:07:35,290
is it that they just don't,

1968
01:07:35,590 --> 01:07:37,060
they don't believe in this guy.

1969
01:07:37,630 --> 01:07:37,931
It's,

1970
01:07:37,931 --> 01:07:39,160
they know who they are,

1971
01:07:39,220 --> 01:07:40,053
I think.

1972
01:07:40,090 --> 01:07:44,080
And they have reached a
level of confidence when you
get to a certain level of

1973
01:07:44,081 --> 01:07:44,650
success.

1974
01:07:44,650 --> 01:07:45,500
Like you know,

1975
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:49,060
John Jones has one loss on his record and
it's by disqualification to fight that

1976
01:07:49,061 --> 01:07:51,580
he was destroying the guy and
he was hitting the guy with,

1977
01:07:51,610 --> 01:07:52,660
it's a really dumb rule,

1978
01:07:52,661 --> 01:07:54,250
but when you throw elbows,

1979
01:07:54,251 --> 01:07:56,860
you're not allowed to
throw a 12 to six elbow,

1980
01:07:56,861 --> 01:07:58,070
meaning coming straight down.

1981
01:07:58,100 --> 01:08:02,530
The only reason that exists is because
when mixed martial arts was first being,

1982
01:08:02,800 --> 01:08:03,633
uh,

1983
01:08:03,790 --> 01:08:06,070
was first being sanctioned
by athletic commissions,

1984
01:08:06,140 --> 01:08:06,360
the,

1985
01:08:06,360 --> 01:08:11,360
the people that were in the athletic
commission had some nervous fears of a,

1986
01:08:11,471 --> 01:08:13,540
they had seen like those
late night TV shows,

1987
01:08:13,541 --> 01:08:15,100
her karate guys are breaking bricks,

1988
01:08:15,260 --> 01:08:17,450
the elbow driving straight down.

1989
01:08:17,570 --> 01:08:19,250
They thought they could kill
somebody if they did that.

1990
01:08:19,251 --> 01:08:20,084
So let's not have,

1991
01:08:20,390 --> 01:08:20,691
we'll,

1992
01:08:20,691 --> 01:08:21,950
we'll eliminate that strike.

1993
01:08:21,980 --> 01:08:22,910
It's a dumb move.

1994
01:08:23,180 --> 01:08:27,410
And Jon Jones hit this guy with a
couple 12 to six elbows and he was

1995
01:08:27,411 --> 01:08:28,490
disqualified in a fight.

1996
01:08:28,490 --> 01:08:30,530
He was just just destroying the guy.

1997
01:08:30,860 --> 01:08:35,720
So for a guy like that who has this
staggering resume of achievement,

1998
01:08:35,721 --> 01:08:39,020
he's widely considered to be the greatest
light heavyweight champion of all

1999
01:08:39,021 --> 01:08:39,261
time.

2000
01:08:39,261 --> 01:08:40,040
If not,

2001
01:08:40,040 --> 01:08:43,070
he's definitely in the running of the
greatest fighter ever of all time.

2002
01:08:43,700 --> 01:08:44,540
For a guy like that,

2003
01:08:44,541 --> 01:08:45,200
he's not,

2004
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:45,830
he's,

2005
01:08:45,830 --> 01:08:48,320
he's confident to the point of,

2006
01:08:48,350 --> 01:08:48,890
you know,

2007
01:08:48,890 --> 01:08:49,723
he's,

2008
01:08:49,820 --> 01:08:50,540
he's,

2009
01:08:50,540 --> 01:08:52,970
he's not trying to just beat this guy,

2010
01:08:52,971 --> 01:08:54,350
although he's going to beat this guy.

2011
01:08:54,530 --> 01:08:57,590
He's trying to go down in history as
one of the greatest of all time or the

2012
01:08:57,591 --> 01:08:58,550
greatest of all time.

2013
01:08:58,910 --> 01:09:00,050
So for a guy like that,

2014
01:09:00,770 --> 01:09:01,880
it doesn't matter what you do,

2015
01:09:01,910 --> 01:09:02,480
he's out.

2016
01:09:02,480 --> 01:09:04,220
He's a Michael Jordan type character.

2017
01:09:04,250 --> 01:09:04,461
You know,

2018
01:09:04,461 --> 01:09:05,810
there's a few of those guys out there.

2019
01:09:05,811 --> 01:09:08,120
There's these Lebron James is these,

2020
01:09:08,121 --> 01:09:08,570
um,

2021
01:09:08,570 --> 01:09:09,580
Larry Bird's,

2022
01:09:09,590 --> 01:09:10,021
they're there.

2023
01:09:10,021 --> 01:09:11,300
They exist in all sports.

2024
01:09:11,510 --> 01:09:13,130
They have this mindset,

2025
01:09:13,370 --> 01:09:14,600
a champion mindset.

2026
01:09:15,670 --> 01:09:17,820
Does he find angry or
does he fight business?

2027
01:09:17,821 --> 01:09:18,770
Like business?

2028
01:09:18,771 --> 01:09:20,390
Like he's very business like,

2029
01:09:20,690 --> 01:09:21,080
yeah,

2030
01:09:21,080 --> 01:09:21,950
he's very business.

2031
01:09:21,951 --> 01:09:23,180
Like he just knows what he's doing.

2032
01:09:23,480 --> 01:09:24,740
The best guys fight business.

2033
01:09:24,741 --> 01:09:27,890
Like there's some guys that fight with
emotion and they're still really good but

2034
01:09:27,891 --> 01:09:30,890
like fade or Amelia Akos
is famous Russian guy.

2035
01:09:30,891 --> 01:09:31,220
He would,

2036
01:09:31,220 --> 01:09:34,760
he would have a look on his face that he
was cashing a check and he was smashing

2037
01:09:34,761 --> 01:09:36,260
a guy's eye orbit in,

2038
01:09:36,470 --> 01:09:37,070
I mean,

2039
01:09:37,070 --> 01:09:37,791
he was just,

2040
01:09:37,791 --> 01:09:38,600
uh,

2041
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:39,200
you know,

2042
01:09:39,200 --> 01:09:41,060
he was the highest level of that,

2043
01:09:41,090 --> 01:09:44,060
like that robotic businesslike
approach to fighting.

2044
01:09:44,320 --> 01:09:46,730
And then after he knocked you
unconscious to help you get back up.

2045
01:09:46,850 --> 01:09:47,600
Yeah,

2046
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:48,141
it was over.

2047
01:09:48,141 --> 01:09:48,891
Once he shut her off,

2048
01:09:48,891 --> 01:09:49,221
it was over.

2049
01:09:49,221 --> 01:09:49,730
There was no,

2050
01:09:49,730 --> 01:09:50,270
no signs.

2051
01:09:50,270 --> 01:09:51,530
He thought emotions were weak.

2052
01:09:51,980 --> 01:09:53,390
Like showing emotions in a fight,

2053
01:09:53,391 --> 01:09:54,230
showing anger,

2054
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:55,273
all that was weak.

2055
01:09:55,510 --> 01:09:56,343
Yeah.

2056
01:09:58,270 --> 01:10:00,610
I think there's a huge
psychological component to it.

2057
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:00,911
I mean,

2058
01:10:00,911 --> 01:10:01,160
I,

2059
01:10:01,160 --> 01:10:02,170
I agree completely.

2060
01:10:02,260 --> 01:10:03,093
Giant,

2061
01:10:03,490 --> 01:10:04,323
gigantic.

2062
01:10:04,450 --> 01:10:05,283
I think you've,

2063
01:10:05,290 --> 01:10:06,060
you,

2064
01:10:06,060 --> 01:10:07,570
I think if you go in with doubt,

2065
01:10:08,440 --> 01:10:09,273
man,

2066
01:10:09,810 --> 01:10:11,970
I just think that's terrible.

2067
01:10:12,050 --> 01:10:12,883
Terrible.

2068
01:10:13,900 --> 01:10:17,140
I think he's here because now you're
fighting yourself and them to,

2069
01:10:17,290 --> 01:10:19,340
you remember the Mike Tyson
fights when he was in his prime?

2070
01:10:19,370 --> 01:10:19,770
Yeah,

2071
01:10:19,770 --> 01:10:21,010
I remember the look in those guys face.

2072
01:10:21,060 --> 01:10:21,640
Oh yeah.

2073
01:10:21,640 --> 01:10:23,200
And they're staring across
the ring and I'm like,

2074
01:10:23,230 --> 01:10:23,921
oh Jesus,

2075
01:10:23,921 --> 01:10:24,900
what did I sign up for?

2076
01:10:25,150 --> 01:10:25,983
There's nothing to lose.

2077
01:10:26,470 --> 01:10:27,850
I don't know what the money was here,

2078
01:10:27,851 --> 01:10:28,571
but it wasn't worth,

2079
01:10:28,571 --> 01:10:33,571
it just seemed like a good idea at the
time as life changing life defining

2080
01:10:33,791 --> 01:10:34,624
moment when you,

2081
01:10:34,780 --> 01:10:39,310
when you were staring across the ring
at Iron Mike and it was like 1989 he was

2082
01:10:39,311 --> 01:10:40,330
at top of the world.

2083
01:10:40,720 --> 01:10:41,170
Yeah.

2084
01:10:41,170 --> 01:10:41,680
And,

2085
01:10:41,680 --> 01:10:42,191
and he,

2086
01:10:42,191 --> 01:10:43,950
and you knew he was going
to come over there and,

2087
01:10:44,020 --> 01:10:47,800
and it's you mail ever been here before?

2088
01:10:48,190 --> 01:10:49,120
Guns blazing.

2089
01:10:49,190 --> 01:10:50,023
Yeah.

2090
01:10:50,440 --> 01:10:50,830
Yeah.

2091
01:10:50,830 --> 01:10:51,580
And he did.

2092
01:10:51,580 --> 01:10:52,413
Yeah.

2093
01:10:52,480 --> 01:10:55,540
Meanwhile you meet him now he's like
the nicest guy on the planet earth.

2094
01:10:55,990 --> 01:10:56,980
Couldn't be sweeter guy.

2095
01:10:57,060 --> 01:10:57,300
Yeah.

2096
01:10:57,300 --> 01:10:58,060
I taught committed.

2097
01:10:58,060 --> 01:11:01,330
He's got a daughter that's apparently
a pretty good tennis player and he's

2098
01:11:01,331 --> 01:11:03,430
really behind her now and focused on that.

2099
01:11:03,550 --> 01:11:07,420
That was him back then because when he
came out of jail and he's fighting Peter

2100
01:11:07,420 --> 01:11:07,950
McNeely,

2101
01:11:07,950 --> 01:11:10,060
he's just letting them
know it's common baby.

2102
01:11:11,350 --> 01:11:12,430
Terrifying man.

2103
01:11:12,431 --> 01:11:12,761
But you know,

2104
01:11:12,761 --> 01:11:13,594
he was,

2105
01:11:13,710 --> 01:11:17,980
he was never as formidable after
jail as he was before he went in now.

2106
01:11:18,780 --> 01:11:18,931
Well,

2107
01:11:18,931 --> 01:11:20,880
there's a ton of factors.

2108
01:11:20,910 --> 01:11:22,260
His training was never the same.

2109
01:11:22,710 --> 01:11:23,160
Um,

2110
01:11:23,160 --> 01:11:23,500
you know,

2111
01:11:23,500 --> 01:11:24,750
he didn't,

2112
01:11:24,751 --> 01:11:27,240
he lost that connection with custom motto.

2113
01:11:27,241 --> 01:11:27,421
You know,

2114
01:11:27,421 --> 01:11:30,120
he had custom motto with training
them when he was at his very best.

2115
01:11:30,121 --> 01:11:34,500
And then Kevin Rooney who worked with
customer and Mike trained him after that,

2116
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:37,020
and then they eventually parted ways.

2117
01:11:37,290 --> 01:11:37,651
And,

2118
01:11:37,651 --> 01:11:37,771
uh,

2119
01:11:37,771 --> 01:11:39,510
that was before the buster Douglas fight.

2120
01:11:39,511 --> 01:11:40,980
I remember he had guys in his corner.

2121
01:11:40,981 --> 01:11:42,330
It didn't even have an end swell.

2122
01:11:42,420 --> 01:11:42,631
I mean,

2123
01:11:42,631 --> 01:11:45,450
his eye was swelling up and they
didn't even have ice to put on it.

2124
01:11:45,880 --> 01:11:46,310
Yeah,

2125
01:11:46,310 --> 01:11:46,411
yeah.

2126
01:11:46,411 --> 01:11:47,760
There was a lot of factors.

2127
01:11:48,180 --> 01:11:49,013
Um,

2128
01:11:49,050 --> 01:11:49,883
but also,

2129
01:11:50,070 --> 01:11:50,431
you know,

2130
01:11:50,431 --> 01:11:51,480
when I talked to Mike,

2131
01:11:51,740 --> 01:11:51,991
uh,

2132
01:11:51,991 --> 01:11:53,130
on the podcast,

2133
01:11:53,190 --> 01:11:54,600
one of the things was,

2134
01:11:54,810 --> 01:11:59,810
and this was just him sort of coming to
grips with the fact that he never really

2135
01:12:01,261 --> 01:12:02,040
had a childhood.

2136
01:12:02,040 --> 01:12:04,440
His childhood was that from
the time he was 12 years old,

2137
01:12:04,650 --> 01:12:05,730
customer Donald took him in,

2138
01:12:05,731 --> 01:12:07,800
was hypnotizing him and
teaching him how to fight,

2139
01:12:08,160 --> 01:12:12,010
teaching amount of fighting in
hypnotizing him to be a machine is going.

2140
01:12:12,330 --> 01:12:13,650
He was literally saying to him,

2141
01:12:13,651 --> 01:12:14,700
you don't exist.

2142
01:12:14,940 --> 01:12:16,110
The task exists,

2143
01:12:16,111 --> 01:12:20,280
the job at hand exists and you're going
to go out there and you're going to get

2144
01:12:20,281 --> 01:12:21,114
the job done.

2145
01:12:21,270 --> 01:12:24,360
And he was telling this to a 13 year
old that never experienced love.

2146
01:12:24,930 --> 01:12:27,690
He just was abandoned and homeless.

2147
01:12:27,691 --> 01:12:28,060
And,

2148
01:12:28,060 --> 01:12:31,980
and this is the only way he ever got
any sort of positive reinforcement.

2149
01:12:31,981 --> 01:12:33,750
And his life is by destroying people.

2150
01:12:35,300 --> 01:12:35,880
Yeah,

2151
01:12:35,880 --> 01:12:36,720
that's sad.

2152
01:12:37,290 --> 01:12:37,980
But you know,

2153
01:12:37,980 --> 01:12:40,740
now he seems to really be
connected to his daughter.

2154
01:12:40,741 --> 01:12:41,131
I mean,

2155
01:12:41,131 --> 01:12:41,341
you,

2156
01:12:41,341 --> 01:12:41,960
you see,

2157
01:12:41,960 --> 01:12:44,070
you see in here a softness in his voice.

2158
01:12:44,071 --> 01:12:45,560
He really is connected to that.

2159
01:12:46,020 --> 01:12:46,853
He learned.

2160
01:12:46,930 --> 01:12:47,180
No,

2161
01:12:47,180 --> 01:12:47,970
I mean,

2162
01:12:47,970 --> 01:12:51,090
it's easy to try to look at
someone like who they were,

2163
01:12:51,390 --> 01:12:51,870
you know,

2164
01:12:51,870 --> 01:12:52,860
20 years ago.

2165
01:12:53,100 --> 01:12:53,341
It's,

2166
01:12:53,341 --> 01:12:54,420
it's easy to do that.

2167
01:12:54,421 --> 01:12:55,050
It's easy to just say,

2168
01:12:55,050 --> 01:12:55,261
oh,

2169
01:12:55,261 --> 01:12:56,094
he's that guy.

2170
01:12:56,490 --> 01:12:59,880
But people evolve and they grow
and he's a great example of that.

2171
01:12:59,881 --> 01:13:01,290
He's a very different person.

2172
01:13:01,530 --> 01:13:01,681
You know,

2173
01:13:01,681 --> 01:13:04,830
he doesn't even work out because
he's worried about his ego.

2174
01:13:05,340 --> 01:13:05,841
Like he,

2175
01:13:05,841 --> 01:13:08,310
he doesn't hit the bag
or do anything like that.

2176
01:13:08,310 --> 01:13:10,920
I said occasionally we'd get on the
treadmill and work out a little bit on a

2177
01:13:10,921 --> 01:13:12,840
treadmill just to get
a little exercise in.

2178
01:13:13,140 --> 01:13:17,250
But he's worried about feeding his ego
was worried about like looking at himself

2179
01:13:17,251 --> 01:13:19,830
in the mirror and bringing
that old monster back again.

2180
01:13:19,890 --> 01:13:20,420
Really?

2181
01:13:20,420 --> 01:13:20,860
Yeah.

2182
01:13:20,860 --> 01:13:21,120
Yeah.

2183
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:21,953
That's what he said.

2184
01:13:23,520 --> 01:13:23,910
Yeah.

2185
01:13:23,910 --> 01:13:27,510
I think you'd be afraid of not being
able to get back to the level he was.

2186
01:13:27,930 --> 01:13:28,920
I don't think he's afraid of that.

2187
01:13:28,921 --> 01:13:30,390
I don't think he wants to be that guy.

2188
01:13:30,990 --> 01:13:33,140
He says he doesn't like that guy blue,

2189
01:13:33,540 --> 01:13:37,830
which is crazy because that guys who
made him rich and famous and everybody

2190
01:13:37,831 --> 01:13:39,720
loves him because he was that guy.

2191
01:13:40,410 --> 01:13:43,590
But who he is now is a
completely different person.

2192
01:13:43,591 --> 01:13:44,490
Just a sweetheart.

2193
01:13:44,730 --> 01:13:45,660
A real sweetheart.

2194
01:13:46,140 --> 01:13:46,500
Yeah.

2195
01:13:46,500 --> 01:13:47,333
He seems like it.

2196
01:13:47,550 --> 01:13:47,731
I mean,

2197
01:13:47,731 --> 01:13:51,270
you'd never think to talk to him
if you didn't know his history.

2198
01:13:51,271 --> 01:13:52,740
You'd never guess that was that guy.

2199
01:13:53,270 --> 01:13:53,520
No.

2200
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:54,353
You'd never would.

2201
01:13:54,690 --> 01:13:55,050
Yeah.

2202
01:13:55,050 --> 01:13:55,591
I think,

2203
01:13:55,591 --> 01:13:56,010
uh,

2204
01:13:56,010 --> 01:13:59,850
the psychological aspect of fighting is
one of the more intriguing parts of it

2205
01:13:59,851 --> 01:14:00,450
to me.

2206
01:14:00,450 --> 01:14:01,283
And you know,

2207
01:14:02,010 --> 01:14:06,630
for me it's like probably one of the
reasons why I got interested in psyche in

2208
01:14:06,631 --> 01:14:10,080
the first place and the way
people think about things and,

2209
01:14:10,081 --> 01:14:11,100
and weakness,

2210
01:14:11,170 --> 01:14:12,250
like real weakness,

2211
01:14:12,730 --> 01:14:13,563
weakness,

2212
01:14:13,660 --> 01:14:16,180
weakness can get exposed in
a variety of different ways.

2213
01:14:16,181 --> 01:14:17,770
But in competition,

2214
01:14:17,820 --> 01:14:18,940
just when you really see it.

2215
01:14:19,980 --> 01:14:20,510
Yeah.

2216
01:14:20,510 --> 01:14:21,040
I'm one of the,

2217
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:21,970
I have this theory,

2218
01:14:23,300 --> 01:14:23,720
you know,

2219
01:14:23,720 --> 01:14:28,720
and we see it in sports and I saw it when
I talked to him and he's been a friend

2220
01:14:29,201 --> 01:14:34,180
of mine for a long time and I was talking
to him about his psychology is he goes

2221
01:14:34,181 --> 01:14:38,590
into a football game and he says he plays
a movie in his mind of the entire game

2222
01:14:39,730 --> 01:14:40,690
before he plays it.

2223
01:14:41,200 --> 01:14:41,880
Because,

2224
01:14:41,880 --> 01:14:42,110
you know,

2225
01:14:42,110 --> 01:14:46,200
in a football game you're going to have
11 or 12 possessions during the game and

2226
01:14:46,940 --> 01:14:47,681
the football game,

2227
01:14:47,681 --> 01:14:49,420
you're gonna get that ball 11 or 12 times.

2228
01:14:50,020 --> 01:14:50,510
And he would say,

2229
01:14:50,510 --> 01:14:53,470
and I'm going to carry that ball
three or four times per possession,

2230
01:14:53,980 --> 01:14:56,380
and he knows which
plays he's going to run.

2231
01:14:56,381 --> 01:14:57,640
He would run him through his head,

2232
01:14:57,641 --> 01:14:58,331
he would see it,

2233
01:14:58,331 --> 01:15:00,430
he would know who was going
to be there to tackle him.

2234
01:15:00,431 --> 01:15:02,770
He would run everything through his head.

2235
01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:07,280
And he's one of those guys that wants
the ball when the clock's running out.

2236
01:15:08,020 --> 01:15:13,020
But I have this theory that situations
do not make heroes situations expose

2237
01:15:17,240 --> 01:15:18,073
heroes.

2238
01:15:18,550 --> 01:15:20,740
And I saw that in Katrina,

2239
01:15:21,770 --> 01:15:26,770
the hurricane that so devastated
that that one neighborhood,

2240
01:15:27,371 --> 01:15:28,270
what ward was it?

2241
01:15:28,360 --> 01:15:29,440
Is it the ninth ward?

2242
01:15:29,470 --> 01:15:30,580
I forget which ward it was.

2243
01:15:30,581 --> 01:15:32,080
That got so wiped out,

2244
01:15:33,070 --> 01:15:33,610
uh,

2245
01:15:33,610 --> 01:15:38,610
when Katrina hit New Orleans and there
was a guy down there that had been really

2246
01:15:39,401 --> 01:15:39,920
quiet.

2247
01:15:39,920 --> 01:15:42,340
Nobody had ever heard anything out of him.

2248
01:15:42,341 --> 01:15:43,180
He was an older guy,

2249
01:15:43,181 --> 01:15:44,020
lived in a house,

2250
01:15:44,021 --> 01:15:45,130
stayed to himself.

2251
01:15:45,910 --> 01:15:49,420
And that night when the
water was at rooftop level,

2252
01:15:49,930 --> 01:15:54,550
I mean he swam rooftop
to rooftop and save six,

2253
01:15:54,551 --> 01:15:55,000
seven,

2254
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:59,110
eight people got him out of
there and he didn't make it out,

2255
01:15:59,800 --> 01:16:03,370
but he got seven or eight people out of
there and you go back and you check his

2256
01:16:03,371 --> 01:16:07,210
history and he was a military hero.

2257
01:16:07,570 --> 01:16:12,570
He just sat quietly in his home
and when the situation came about,

2258
01:16:13,960 --> 01:16:15,730
it revealed who he was.

2259
01:16:16,060 --> 01:16:17,740
And I think that's what happens.

2260
01:16:17,741 --> 01:16:19,930
I think if you've got a hero,

2261
01:16:19,931 --> 01:16:20,830
they just sit there,

2262
01:16:20,831 --> 01:16:24,670
sit there and sit there until a
situation reveals who they are.

2263
01:16:24,671 --> 01:16:26,230
I don't think it makes him a hero.

2264
01:16:26,231 --> 01:16:31,231
I think it reveals that they're heroes
and I think that's what happens to

2265
01:16:32,171 --> 01:16:32,531
people.

2266
01:16:32,531 --> 01:16:33,070
They,

2267
01:16:33,070 --> 01:16:35,470
they are who they are until they get in,

2268
01:16:35,471 --> 01:16:38,200
in the opportunity that comes along and
they're going to show you who that is

2269
01:16:38,520 --> 01:16:42,190
and they may show you they're a coward
where they may show you that they've got

2270
01:16:42,191 --> 01:16:45,910
the focus to hang or they may
show you that they're a hero,

2271
01:16:45,940 --> 01:16:49,780
but life circumstances are going to come
along and you're going to show you who

2272
01:16:49,781 --> 01:16:50,614
somebody is.

2273
01:16:50,700 --> 01:16:51,380
Yeah,

2274
01:16:51,380 --> 01:16:52,410
I completely agree.

2275
01:16:53,040 --> 01:16:58,040
And I think what's also interesting is
when someone does get revealed to be a

2276
01:16:58,561 --> 01:16:59,394
coward,

2277
01:16:59,730 --> 01:17:00,990
they can become a hero.

2278
01:17:01,540 --> 01:17:02,610
It's very hard.

2279
01:17:02,820 --> 01:17:06,510
It's very hard to get past the
memory of you being a coward.

2280
01:17:07,890 --> 01:17:08,240
Well,

2281
01:17:08,240 --> 01:17:09,950
and I'll tell you why I think that's true.

2282
01:17:09,951 --> 01:17:10,070
If

2283
01:17:10,070 --> 01:17:11,150
you want to know please.

2284
01:17:11,151 --> 01:17:11,984
I mean maybe

2285
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:14,180
going away,

2286
01:17:14,180 --> 01:17:15,170
going off on a tangent,

2287
01:17:15,171 --> 01:17:16,004
come on.

2288
01:17:16,580 --> 01:17:16,761
No,

2289
01:17:16,761 --> 01:17:17,594
I think,

2290
01:17:18,290 --> 01:17:22,940
I think we learn about ourselves and yo
everybody talks about self esteem and

2291
01:17:22,941 --> 01:17:23,774
self worth,

2292
01:17:24,410 --> 01:17:29,270
but nobody ever talks about what
it really is or how we get it.

2293
01:17:29,870 --> 01:17:34,870
And I think I think about it in terms
of self attribution because you know how

2294
01:17:37,011 --> 01:17:38,840
you form opinions of other people.

2295
01:17:39,260 --> 01:17:39,620
Like,

2296
01:17:39,620 --> 01:17:41,350
if you look at this guy and you,

2297
01:17:41,400 --> 01:17:45,920
you maybe you work with this guy and so
you watch him across a couple of years

2298
01:17:46,490 --> 01:17:50,240
and maybe this guy shows up to work
every day and he's there 15 minutes early

2299
01:17:50,600 --> 01:17:51,950
and he unlocks the place,

2300
01:17:51,951 --> 01:17:52,940
gets everything ready,

2301
01:17:52,941 --> 01:17:53,930
puts a coffee on,

2302
01:17:53,931 --> 01:17:54,920
has his desk ready,

2303
01:17:54,921 --> 01:17:56,000
he's all buttoned up.

2304
01:17:56,001 --> 01:17:56,371
And Man,

2305
01:17:56,371 --> 01:17:57,141
when the bell rings,

2306
01:17:57,141 --> 01:17:58,100
he's ready to go.

2307
01:17:58,550 --> 01:18:01,730
And you just learned that
this guy's buttoned up,

2308
01:18:01,731 --> 01:18:02,360
ready to go.

2309
01:18:02,360 --> 01:18:03,920
Dependable never misses.

2310
01:18:03,921 --> 01:18:04,754
He's always there.

2311
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:09,560
So you attribute certain traits and
characteristics to him based on your

2312
01:18:09,561 --> 01:18:14,150
observations of him and your experience
of him based on that you assign certain

2313
01:18:14,151 --> 01:18:15,560
traits and characteristics to him.

2314
01:18:16,550 --> 01:18:21,550
But I say that's exactly the same way
we form our own self image and our own

2315
01:18:23,720 --> 01:18:25,040
level of self worth.

2316
01:18:25,070 --> 01:18:30,070
We watch ourselves go through life
and we watch how we handle certain

2317
01:18:31,161 --> 01:18:32,900
circumstances and situations.

2318
01:18:33,470 --> 01:18:37,700
And that's why I say overindulgence is
one of the most insidious forms of child

2319
01:18:37,701 --> 01:18:39,650
abuse known to parenting.

2320
01:18:40,340 --> 01:18:40,910
Uh,

2321
01:18:40,910 --> 01:18:41,960
it's not the worst.

2322
01:18:41,961 --> 01:18:46,961
It's just insidious because
if you overindulge your
children and do everything

2323
01:18:47,271 --> 01:18:47,811
for them,

2324
01:18:47,811 --> 01:18:50,570
you never let them observe themselves,

2325
01:18:50,571 --> 01:18:52,100
master their environment.

2326
01:18:52,700 --> 01:18:55,190
You never let them step back and say,

2327
01:18:55,191 --> 01:18:55,820
wow,

2328
01:18:55,820 --> 01:18:56,930
I did that.

2329
01:18:57,440 --> 01:18:58,550
I built this,

2330
01:18:58,551 --> 01:18:59,900
I overcame that,

2331
01:18:59,930 --> 01:19:01,310
I handled this,

2332
01:19:01,311 --> 01:19:02,420
I did that.

2333
01:19:03,080 --> 01:19:04,160
And so we,

2334
01:19:04,270 --> 01:19:08,360
that's the same way we make our own
self image and level of self worth.

2335
01:19:08,360 --> 01:19:11,960
We watch ourselves
overcome the third grade.

2336
01:19:11,961 --> 01:19:14,570
We watch ourselves stand up to a bully,

2337
01:19:14,571 --> 01:19:19,571
we watch ourselves handle a test with
the information that intimidated us or we

2338
01:19:21,081 --> 01:19:26,081
watch ourselves make it on to the Little
League baseball team and actually get a

2339
01:19:27,711 --> 01:19:29,030
hit when we needed to.

2340
01:19:29,031 --> 01:19:34,031
Where we watch ourselves get on to the
debate team and actually argue something

2341
01:19:34,821 --> 01:19:35,541
successfully,

2342
01:19:35,541 --> 01:19:38,390
whether it's academic
or athletic or musical.

2343
01:19:38,870 --> 01:19:41,660
We watch ourselves do it
and so we go back and say,

2344
01:19:41,720 --> 01:19:42,110
Hey,

2345
01:19:42,110 --> 01:19:43,220
I did that.

2346
01:19:43,250 --> 01:19:45,200
I attribute to myself the ability,

2347
01:19:45,201 --> 01:19:46,160
I can hang,

2348
01:19:46,670 --> 01:19:47,630
I can do this.

2349
01:19:47,631 --> 01:19:49,160
I can rise to the occasion.

2350
01:19:49,580 --> 01:19:54,580
Or we watch ourselves fold like a
pup tent and a windstorm and say,

2351
01:19:54,740 --> 01:19:55,310
you know,

2352
01:19:55,310 --> 01:19:56,150
I can hang.

2353
01:19:56,160 --> 01:19:56,993
I don't have it.

2354
01:19:57,830 --> 01:20:00,410
And we make those
attributions to ourselves.

2355
01:20:00,411 --> 01:20:03,800
And so we strength from the challenge
for the rest of our lives until like you

2356
01:20:03,801 --> 01:20:04,011
said,

2357
01:20:04,011 --> 01:20:09,011
it's hard to overcome that and something
pushes you up until you finally observe

2358
01:20:10,021 --> 01:20:11,460
yourself overcome something.

2359
01:20:12,210 --> 01:20:17,210
And I think that's how we form our level
of self esteem and our identity about

2360
01:20:18,301 --> 01:20:19,134
who we are.

2361
01:20:19,560 --> 01:20:21,900
And I don't think most
people think about that.

2362
01:20:22,020 --> 01:20:22,711
Look back and say,

2363
01:20:22,711 --> 01:20:22,951
okay,

2364
01:20:22,951 --> 01:20:23,784
how did I,

2365
01:20:24,090 --> 01:20:25,650
how did I get to be Joe Rogan?

2366
01:20:25,651 --> 01:20:26,490
As I sit in a chair,

2367
01:20:26,491 --> 01:20:27,570
you have a self image,

2368
01:20:27,571 --> 01:20:28,850
you have a level of confidence,

2369
01:20:29,280 --> 01:20:29,641
ego,

2370
01:20:29,641 --> 01:20:30,474
strength,

2371
01:20:30,970 --> 01:20:31,803
uh,

2372
01:20:32,430 --> 01:20:37,430
a level of self worth that's attributable
to things you've watched yourself do

2373
01:20:38,100 --> 01:20:39,090
or not do,

2374
01:20:39,091 --> 01:20:39,631
achieve,

2375
01:20:39,631 --> 01:20:40,321
not achieve,

2376
01:20:40,321 --> 01:20:43,440
overcome or whatever throughout your life.

2377
01:20:43,920 --> 01:20:44,753
And,

2378
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:46,320
and I think to know yourself,

2379
01:20:46,321 --> 01:20:47,640
you have to know what those things are.

2380
01:20:48,360 --> 01:20:49,590
I think you're 100% right.

2381
01:20:49,890 --> 01:20:53,910
And I think for children participating
in things that are going to test you so

2382
01:20:53,911 --> 01:20:54,744
critical,

2383
01:20:54,810 --> 01:20:57,150
giving them this opportunity
to realize that the,

2384
01:20:57,160 --> 01:20:57,670
the,

2385
01:20:57,670 --> 01:21:01,470
there's a line between success and failure
and that you could push through that

2386
01:21:01,471 --> 01:21:02,140
line.

2387
01:21:02,140 --> 01:21:02,461
You could,

2388
01:21:02,461 --> 01:21:06,700
you could become successful at
something and learn watching kids.

2389
01:21:06,701 --> 01:21:06,801
I,

2390
01:21:06,801 --> 01:21:08,880
that's why I think sports are
so important for children.

2391
01:21:09,270 --> 01:21:13,830
I think that's one of the more insidious
things about having these participation

2392
01:21:13,831 --> 01:21:16,590
trophies for kids where
that nobody wins the game.

2393
01:21:16,591 --> 01:21:17,221
Yay.

2394
01:21:17,221 --> 01:21:17,941
Everybody plays.

2395
01:21:17,941 --> 01:21:18,631
But nobody wins.

2396
01:21:18,631 --> 01:21:19,560
We don't keep score.

2397
01:21:19,880 --> 01:21:21,150
Why the fuck you plan?

2398
01:21:21,560 --> 01:21:22,080
Yeah.

2399
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:25,880
I mean that just goes down as
an environmental non event.

2400
01:21:25,900 --> 01:21:26,350
Yeah.

2401
01:21:26,350 --> 01:21:30,060
I mean that contributes nothing to your
definition is just something to do.

2402
01:21:30,120 --> 01:21:31,830
It's also psychologically,

2403
01:21:32,010 --> 01:21:33,270
it's coddling.

2404
01:21:33,330 --> 01:21:33,901
It's very,

2405
01:21:33,901 --> 01:21:38,880
it's very damaging for your potential
education that you would get from that

2406
01:21:38,881 --> 01:21:39,600
situation.

2407
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:44,160
The bad feeling that you get when someone
scores on you is motivation for you to

2408
01:21:44,161 --> 01:21:45,360
be better at defense.

2409
01:21:45,790 --> 01:21:46,623
Yeah.

2410
01:21:47,380 --> 01:21:47,900
You know,

2411
01:21:47,900 --> 01:21:49,760
I think we cheat kids when we do that,

2412
01:21:49,790 --> 01:21:51,630
and of course you gotta play everybody.

2413
01:21:51,730 --> 01:21:55,340
I get that not everybody
is meant to be an athlete,

2414
01:21:55,341 --> 01:21:55,700
so,

2415
01:21:55,700 --> 01:21:56,241
okay,

2416
01:21:56,241 --> 01:21:57,074
look,

2417
01:21:57,170 --> 01:21:58,280
go do something else.

2418
01:21:59,380 --> 01:22:01,030
Be Good at what you're good at.

2419
01:22:01,170 --> 01:22:02,960
And if you really want to do it well,

2420
01:22:02,990 --> 01:22:04,220
you've got a long road.

2421
01:22:04,280 --> 01:22:05,960
It's a greased hill.

2422
01:22:06,380 --> 01:22:07,213
Start running.

2423
01:22:07,890 --> 01:22:08,580
Yeah.

2424
01:22:08,580 --> 01:22:10,140
Everything's not for everybody.

2425
01:22:10,260 --> 01:22:14,880
So find what you're good at and
watch yourself achieve in that lane.

2426
01:22:15,870 --> 01:22:16,231
You know,

2427
01:22:16,231 --> 01:22:16,790
that's like,

2428
01:22:16,790 --> 01:22:17,623
I,

2429
01:22:18,030 --> 01:22:20,070
I can't carry a tune in a bucket.

2430
01:22:20,790 --> 01:22:21,520
I,

2431
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:22,353
I can't even,

2432
01:22:22,410 --> 01:22:23,790
I can play no instrument.

2433
01:22:23,791 --> 01:22:24,720
I can't sing.

2434
01:22:25,470 --> 01:22:26,580
I can play a radio of,

2435
01:22:26,581 --> 01:22:27,990
it's got a big on off knob.

2436
01:22:28,020 --> 01:22:28,853
That's it.

2437
01:22:29,460 --> 01:22:30,281
And so I,

2438
01:22:30,281 --> 01:22:31,114
I don't try,

2439
01:22:31,120 --> 01:22:31,321
I mean,

2440
01:22:31,321 --> 01:22:31,650
that's,

2441
01:22:31,650 --> 01:22:32,610
I'm just not good at that.

2442
01:22:32,611 --> 01:22:36,930
So I go into lanes that I can do
stuff and observe myself in that.

2443
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:41,170
But I think you cheat kids if you
don't let them observe themselves face

2444
01:22:41,171 --> 01:22:42,330
adversity and overcome it.

2445
01:22:42,650 --> 01:22:43,341
Absolutely.

2446
01:22:43,341 --> 01:22:46,880
And it's also an interesting lesson
to learn that life isn't fair.

2447
01:22:47,360 --> 01:22:47,631
I mean,

2448
01:22:47,631 --> 01:22:52,631
if you're a kid and you're playing
basketball with a 15 year old Lebron James

2449
01:22:53,210 --> 01:22:54,650
and you're my height,

2450
01:22:54,890 --> 01:22:55,311
you go,

2451
01:22:55,311 --> 01:22:56,144
Huh,

2452
01:22:56,710 --> 01:22:57,410
yeah,

2453
01:22:57,410 --> 01:22:58,940
this ain't gonna work out at all.

2454
01:22:59,130 --> 01:22:59,810
Yeah.

2455
01:22:59,810 --> 01:23:01,160
You're looking at a towel boy here.

2456
01:23:01,730 --> 01:23:03,410
This is not fucking happening.

2457
01:23:03,830 --> 01:23:06,370
And you have to be able to
that and appreciate that.

2458
01:23:06,371 --> 01:23:07,570
And then conversely,

2459
01:23:07,571 --> 01:23:10,360
if you're very physically frail,

2460
01:23:10,660 --> 01:23:10,931
you know,

2461
01:23:10,931 --> 01:23:12,610
maybe wrestling's not for you either.

2462
01:23:12,611 --> 01:23:12,851
You know,

2463
01:23:12,851 --> 01:23:13,300
maybe,

2464
01:23:13,300 --> 01:23:13,991
maybe you,

2465
01:23:13,991 --> 01:23:14,350
uh,

2466
01:23:14,350 --> 01:23:18,160
we need to do something about your
body before you engage in any sort of a

2467
01:23:18,161 --> 01:23:19,180
combat sport.

2468
01:23:19,750 --> 01:23:19,931
You know,

2469
01:23:19,931 --> 01:23:21,390
they did an experiment back in,

2470
01:23:21,420 --> 01:23:24,280
I think it was the 60s they did
something called teaching machines.

2471
01:23:24,281 --> 01:23:25,040
Have you ever seen that?

2472
01:23:25,040 --> 01:23:25,873
No.

2473
01:23:27,270 --> 01:23:28,051
Short period of time.

2474
01:23:28,051 --> 01:23:28,884
But they,

2475
01:23:29,280 --> 01:23:32,340
they took students in the class where
they put the steps of learning the

2476
01:23:32,341 --> 01:23:37,140
information so close together that
there was never a failure experience.

2477
01:23:37,740 --> 01:23:42,740
It would say like the war of 1812 happened
in 1812 then the next thing would say

2478
01:23:44,880 --> 01:23:48,150
the war of 1812 happened in blank.

2479
01:23:48,390 --> 01:23:49,650
You fill in 1812.

2480
01:23:49,651 --> 01:23:50,820
I mean come on,

2481
01:23:50,821 --> 01:23:51,990
potted plant could get that.

2482
01:23:52,480 --> 01:23:57,180
So they've put it together and they would
teach the information and they would

2483
01:23:57,181 --> 01:24:00,600
teach it to criteria where
you mastered the information.

2484
01:24:00,601 --> 01:24:04,080
You had it 100% and I said,

2485
01:24:04,081 --> 01:24:04,530
wow,

2486
01:24:04,530 --> 01:24:05,363
this is great.

2487
01:24:05,370 --> 01:24:06,510
Everybody learned it.

2488
01:24:06,511 --> 01:24:08,280
So everybody made a hundred,

2489
01:24:08,400 --> 01:24:09,840
everybody got the information,

2490
01:24:09,841 --> 01:24:11,010
they truly did learn it.

2491
01:24:11,011 --> 01:24:12,120
There was no question about it.

2492
01:24:12,121 --> 01:24:15,210
They learned the information
and so they did great.

2493
01:24:15,990 --> 01:24:17,730
And then they took them
out of that program.

2494
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:19,590
And put them back in
the regular classroom.

2495
01:24:20,490 --> 01:24:22,980
And the first time they came to questions,

2496
01:24:22,981 --> 01:24:24,210
they didn't know the answer to.

2497
01:24:24,211 --> 01:24:29,190
The first time they didn't get a hundred
they came apart like a cheap suit.

2498
01:24:29,250 --> 01:24:30,330
They panicked,

2499
01:24:30,331 --> 01:24:32,610
they didn't know how to handle adversity,

2500
01:24:32,611 --> 01:24:36,690
they didn't know how to handle it when
they didn't have the right answers,

2501
01:24:36,720 --> 01:24:40,170
they didn't learn how to not be perfect.

2502
01:24:40,740 --> 01:24:45,570
And so they scrapped the whole program
because he said you can't do this because

2503
01:24:45,571 --> 01:24:47,010
that's not the way life is.

2504
01:24:47,730 --> 01:24:48,660
And if,

2505
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:49,740
I mean it's,

2506
01:24:49,740 --> 01:24:52,470
you're not teaching them
how the real world works,

2507
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:57,800
you might as well teach them to go on
red and stop on green and then give them

2508
01:24:58,131 --> 01:24:59,460
the keys and put them out in life.

2509
01:24:59,461 --> 01:25:00,660
Cause that's not the way it works.

2510
01:25:00,661 --> 01:25:05,160
And those kids were absolutely screwed
up when they got into a truly competitive

2511
01:25:05,161 --> 01:25:05,994
environment.

2512
01:25:06,540 --> 01:25:07,950
It can't be success only.

2513
01:25:08,130 --> 01:25:08,491
Yeah,

2514
01:25:08,491 --> 01:25:09,720
it doesn't make any sense.

2515
01:25:09,990 --> 01:25:10,980
It's not healthy.

2516
01:25:11,010 --> 01:25:12,120
It's not good for you.

2517
01:25:12,150 --> 01:25:13,290
You don't learn from it.

2518
01:25:13,291 --> 01:25:17,190
I mean the whole idea about school is
you're supposed to be setting kids up for

2519
01:25:17,191 --> 01:25:17,731
the future.

2520
01:25:17,731 --> 01:25:18,840
He's supposed to be teaching them,

2521
01:25:19,200 --> 01:25:20,580
not just information,

2522
01:25:20,581 --> 01:25:21,900
but teaching them how to learn.

2523
01:25:21,901 --> 01:25:22,734
And

2524
01:25:23,810 --> 01:25:24,081
Yeah,

2525
01:25:24,081 --> 01:25:24,920
and that worries me.

2526
01:25:25,160 --> 01:25:25,491
You know,

2527
01:25:25,491 --> 01:25:27,950
I've read that story not
long ago when new students,

2528
01:25:27,951 --> 01:25:30,020
I think it was at Ucla in law school,

2529
01:25:31,400 --> 01:25:36,400
complained and got a professor either
disciplined or fired because he required

2530
01:25:40,131 --> 01:25:45,131
them to take a counter argument over
something controversial like Ferguson.

2531
01:25:48,140 --> 01:25:48,411
He said,

2532
01:25:48,411 --> 01:25:49,244
I want you to,

2533
01:25:49,310 --> 01:25:49,740
you know,

2534
01:25:49,740 --> 01:25:53,420
I know you that you're
all on this point of view.

2535
01:25:53,960 --> 01:25:56,810
Now I want you to prepare an
argument for the other side.

2536
01:25:57,830 --> 01:25:58,610
And they all said,

2537
01:25:58,610 --> 01:25:58,850
ah,

2538
01:25:58,850 --> 01:25:59,360
that's,

2539
01:25:59,360 --> 01:26:00,440
that's upsetting to us.

2540
01:26:00,441 --> 01:26:01,580
We just can't do it.

2541
01:26:01,581 --> 01:26:02,960
And they went to the administration and,

2542
01:26:03,910 --> 01:26:04,151
wow,

2543
01:26:04,151 --> 01:26:04,751
that's crazy.

2544
01:26:04,751 --> 01:26:06,580
Because you may have to do,

2545
01:26:06,670 --> 01:26:07,421
as a lawyer,

2546
01:26:07,421 --> 01:26:11,200
you may have to represent someone who's
done something you don't agree with.

2547
01:26:11,590 --> 01:26:12,940
If that's what you want
to do for a living.

2548
01:26:12,941 --> 01:26:13,200
Right.

2549
01:26:13,200 --> 01:26:14,033
I mean,

2550
01:26:14,160 --> 01:26:15,330
are you kidding me?

2551
01:26:15,710 --> 01:26:18,060
They were like needed therapy.

2552
01:26:19,900 --> 01:26:20,550
I'm like,

2553
01:26:20,550 --> 01:26:23,250
what the hell has happened here?

2554
01:26:24,300 --> 01:26:25,170
Oh my God,

2555
01:26:25,340 --> 01:26:26,440
that is so crazy.

2556
01:26:26,660 --> 01:26:27,493
That's nuts.

2557
01:26:28,080 --> 01:26:28,950
That's crazy.

2558
01:26:29,790 --> 01:26:30,211
You know?

2559
01:26:30,211 --> 01:26:31,044
Um,

2560
01:26:32,280 --> 01:26:33,113
yeah.

2561
01:26:34,260 --> 01:26:34,740
Well,

2562
01:26:34,740 --> 01:26:35,281
there's a,

2563
01:26:35,281 --> 01:26:37,560
there's a movement going on
in this country right now,

2564
01:26:37,580 --> 01:26:40,950
the social justice movement and a,

2565
01:26:41,280 --> 01:26:46,280
it leans in that direction that people
don't want to look at things for how they

2566
01:26:46,651 --> 01:26:46,891
are.

2567
01:26:46,891 --> 01:26:48,520
They want to look at things
for how they want them

2568
01:26:48,630 --> 01:26:49,463
to be.

2569
01:26:49,980 --> 01:26:50,300
Yeah.

2570
01:26:50,300 --> 01:26:51,120
That just,

2571
01:26:51,120 --> 01:26:52,320
I just don't understand.

2572
01:26:52,360 --> 01:26:53,880
You cannot

2573
01:26:55,460 --> 01:27:00,460
legislate that everything is going to be
equal for everybody because everybody's

2574
01:27:03,051 --> 01:27:03,884
not equal.

2575
01:27:04,680 --> 01:27:05,180
I'm sorry.

2576
01:27:05,180 --> 01:27:06,050
They're not equal.

2577
01:27:06,110 --> 01:27:09,680
They may be equal in terms of
their value as a human being,

2578
01:27:10,370 --> 01:27:12,530
but they're not equal in mass skills.

2579
01:27:12,590 --> 01:27:14,780
They're not equal in how fast they run.

2580
01:27:14,781 --> 01:27:16,670
They're not equal in creativity.

2581
01:27:16,671 --> 01:27:17,390
They're not equal.

2582
01:27:17,390 --> 01:27:18,980
Everybody has their own value,

2583
01:27:18,981 --> 01:27:21,380
but that doesn't mean they're marketable.

2584
01:27:21,381 --> 01:27:26,381
Skills in an open society and an
open market are going to be the same

2585
01:27:26,660 --> 01:27:26,811
now.

2586
01:27:26,811 --> 01:27:27,644
It's ridiculous.

2587
01:27:27,680 --> 01:27:28,280
I used to have,

2588
01:27:28,280 --> 01:27:32,120
I had a joke on one of my special
saw two specials ago about,

2589
01:27:32,121 --> 01:27:32,290
uh,

2590
01:27:32,290 --> 01:27:34,790
there was a story about a woman
who was guarding the White House.

2591
01:27:35,240 --> 01:27:38,810
She was the lone guard at one of the doors
of the White House and some crazy man

2592
01:27:38,811 --> 01:27:40,490
broke in and uh,

2593
01:27:40,580 --> 01:27:43,430
knocked her to the ground and just
ran through the White House and he was

2594
01:27:43,431 --> 01:27:46,880
running around inside the White House for
like three minutes before they finally

2595
01:27:47,060 --> 01:27:48,260
some off duty.

2596
01:27:48,290 --> 01:27:48,750
Uh,

2597
01:27:48,750 --> 01:27:51,440
see a secret service
agent tackled this guy.

2598
01:27:51,980 --> 01:27:52,521
I saw like,

2599
01:27:52,521 --> 01:27:53,390
what the fuck is going on?

2600
01:27:53,391 --> 01:27:54,530
This guy's running
through the White House,

2601
01:27:54,531 --> 01:27:55,364
tackle this guy,

2602
01:27:55,490 --> 01:28:00,490
and that the joke was that people think
that a woman can do everything a man can

2603
01:28:01,401 --> 01:28:01,611
do.

2604
01:28:01,611 --> 01:28:01,851
I go,

2605
01:28:01,851 --> 01:28:03,290
a woman can do everything a man could do.

2606
01:28:03,500 --> 01:28:04,333
Is that true?

2607
01:28:04,400 --> 01:28:07,130
And some woman in the crowd
of the comedy store is like,

2608
01:28:07,131 --> 01:28:07,964
yes.

2609
01:28:08,030 --> 01:28:08,301
I go,

2610
01:28:08,301 --> 01:28:08,960
well,

2611
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:10,490
that doesn't make any fucking sense.

2612
01:28:10,580 --> 01:28:14,470
Here's why it doesn't make
any sense because a man
can't do everything a man can

2613
01:28:14,471 --> 01:28:15,304
do.

2614
01:28:15,380 --> 01:28:15,681
I go,

2615
01:28:15,681 --> 01:28:16,130
look,

2616
01:28:16,130 --> 01:28:19,850
I've met Shaquille O'Neal and
his Dick is where my face is.

2617
01:28:20,090 --> 01:28:23,240
And if the White House has
experienced seeing a Shaq attack,

2618
01:28:23,510 --> 01:28:27,470
I'm the wrong person to save the world
because he's just going to run right over

2619
01:28:27,471 --> 01:28:28,070
me.

2620
01:28:28,070 --> 01:28:28,550
I go,

2621
01:28:28,550 --> 01:28:31,580
but if my wife and kid where garden,

2622
01:28:31,581 --> 01:28:32,414
the White House,

2623
01:28:32,420 --> 01:28:33,860
guess what I'm getting in?

2624
01:28:34,430 --> 01:28:34,761
Okay.

2625
01:28:34,761 --> 01:28:35,720
I love my family,

2626
01:28:35,721 --> 01:28:37,810
but if it's between me and get it,

2627
01:28:37,830 --> 01:28:39,260
there's no way they're
going to be able to stop me.

2628
01:28:39,590 --> 01:28:40,550
I loved them to death,

2629
01:28:40,551 --> 01:28:44,780
but I'm a man and they're women and if
there's a woman guard in the White House,

2630
01:28:44,781 --> 01:28:45,561
I don't care who she is,

2631
01:28:45,561 --> 01:28:46,400
I'll fuck her up.

2632
01:28:46,670 --> 01:28:47,750
It's not going to happen.

2633
01:28:47,990 --> 01:28:48,920
This is crazy.

2634
01:28:49,220 --> 01:28:49,850
But this,

2635
01:28:49,850 --> 01:28:54,850
someone had this idea that they would
put a woman in charge of a very physical

2636
01:28:57,171 --> 01:28:57,830
job.

2637
01:28:57,830 --> 01:29:02,580
You should have a giant man with a
violent temper and he should be armed.

2638
01:29:02,760 --> 01:29:03,091
Okay.

2639
01:29:03,091 --> 01:29:07,320
Cause this is the guy that's keeping
bad people from the fucking president.

2640
01:29:07,710 --> 01:29:08,543
Yeah.

2641
01:29:08,710 --> 01:29:09,400
Uh,

2642
01:29:09,400 --> 01:29:09,920
I don't know.

2643
01:29:09,920 --> 01:29:10,850
I don't understand.

2644
01:29:10,910 --> 01:29:13,280
It just seems like you
got to find your own lane.

2645
01:29:13,340 --> 01:29:13,760
I mean,

2646
01:29:13,760 --> 01:29:14,121
yeah.

2647
01:29:14,121 --> 01:29:15,770
You don't want to put me in the NBA.

2648
01:29:16,110 --> 01:29:16,321
Yeah.

2649
01:29:16,321 --> 01:29:18,270
Physical things in particular.

2650
01:29:18,900 --> 01:29:20,460
And then there's also mental things.

2651
01:29:20,610 --> 01:29:21,120
Look,

2652
01:29:21,120 --> 01:29:22,170
I suck at math.

2653
01:29:22,650 --> 01:29:22,861
Okay.

2654
01:29:22,861 --> 01:29:23,010
If,

2655
01:29:23,010 --> 01:29:23,250
if,

2656
01:29:23,250 --> 01:29:26,100
if everyone has a chance to work at cern,

2657
01:29:26,400 --> 01:29:26,671
right.

2658
01:29:26,671 --> 01:29:29,040
Everyone has a chance to work
at the large Hadron collider,

2659
01:29:29,041 --> 01:29:30,990
including people that have
no idea about physics.

2660
01:29:31,160 --> 01:29:33,690
We're going to have a real time
making these equations work.

2661
01:29:33,730 --> 01:29:34,563
Yeah,

2662
01:29:35,680 --> 01:29:37,420
that's what I mean about
finding your own lane.

2663
01:29:37,480 --> 01:29:37,690
Yeah.

2664
01:29:37,690 --> 01:29:38,040
Cue.

2665
01:29:38,040 --> 01:29:40,150
I can't add two and two
and get five every time.

2666
01:29:40,180 --> 01:29:41,470
I'm just not good at math,

2667
01:29:42,100 --> 01:29:43,510
but I'm good with words.

2668
01:29:43,750 --> 01:29:44,411
I can talk.

2669
01:29:44,411 --> 01:29:46,510
I can read faster than
I can comprehend well,

2670
01:29:46,810 --> 01:29:48,700
but I'm not good with math,

2671
01:29:48,760 --> 01:29:52,600
so I got myself into a lane
where I talked for a living.

2672
01:29:52,601 --> 01:29:53,201
I read,

2673
01:29:53,201 --> 01:29:53,771
I talk,

2674
01:29:53,771 --> 01:29:54,100
I,

2675
01:29:54,100 --> 01:29:55,030
it's qualitative,

2676
01:29:55,031 --> 01:29:55,990
not quantitative.

2677
01:29:57,310 --> 01:29:59,950
I can accept that I'm not suited for that.

2678
01:30:00,070 --> 01:30:00,903
I mean,

2679
01:30:01,060 --> 01:30:03,160
I don't feel bad about
myself because of that.

2680
01:30:03,260 --> 01:30:05,060
Once you do something
and you're good at it,

2681
01:30:05,061 --> 01:30:07,010
you can accept not being
good at other things.

2682
01:30:07,011 --> 01:30:09,500
It's much easier if you find
the thing that you're good at,

2683
01:30:09,501 --> 01:30:12,740
whether it's gymnastics
or singing or painting,

2684
01:30:12,741 --> 01:30:13,790
whatever the fuck it is.

2685
01:30:13,960 --> 01:30:15,830
If you could find a thing
that you're good at,

2686
01:30:15,960 --> 01:30:17,000
it will make you,

2687
01:30:17,170 --> 01:30:21,350
it'll give you a feeling of self
worth and you won't need to be good at

2688
01:30:21,351 --> 01:30:25,250
everything you can accept and you can
enjoy other people being good at things as

2689
01:30:25,251 --> 01:30:26,084
well.

2690
01:30:26,500 --> 01:30:26,920
Yeah.

2691
01:30:26,920 --> 01:30:28,240
You know what I said earlier,

2692
01:30:28,330 --> 01:30:31,690
my dad was an alcoholic and I would
compare myself to that kid across,

2693
01:30:31,691 --> 01:30:33,430
cause I had a damaged personal truth,

2694
01:30:34,210 --> 01:30:39,070
but I found a currency because at that
time in my life I was a pretty decent

2695
01:30:39,071 --> 01:30:41,740
athlete for this small
school I was going to.

2696
01:30:41,741 --> 01:30:43,030
So that was my currency.

2697
01:30:43,120 --> 01:30:43,660
Yeah.

2698
01:30:43,660 --> 01:30:48,580
So now it didn't matter what was happening
at home because I got strokes for

2699
01:30:48,581 --> 01:30:50,890
being able to jump high
and run fast at school.

2700
01:30:50,891 --> 01:30:52,360
So that became my currency.

2701
01:30:52,810 --> 01:30:55,810
So now when I compared myself to him,

2702
01:30:55,960 --> 01:30:56,441
okay,

2703
01:30:56,441 --> 01:30:58,450
maybe my home life wasn't as good as his,

2704
01:30:58,451 --> 01:30:59,920
but I could run faster and jump higher.

2705
01:30:59,921 --> 01:31:01,960
So that became my currency.

2706
01:31:01,961 --> 01:31:02,820
So now I,

2707
01:31:03,130 --> 01:31:03,461
okay.

2708
01:31:03,461 --> 01:31:05,470
That leveled the playing field for me.

2709
01:31:06,040 --> 01:31:06,910
And you all would,

2710
01:31:06,911 --> 01:31:07,421
like you said,

2711
01:31:07,421 --> 01:31:11,050
find what you're good at at a given
time and do what you're good at.

2712
01:31:11,160 --> 01:31:11,431
Yeah.

2713
01:31:11,431 --> 01:31:12,630
Find something you love,

2714
01:31:12,631 --> 01:31:15,360
find something you're passionate about
and that you could also excel at.

2715
01:31:15,450 --> 01:31:19,110
And if you can work it out where it's
your vocation and your avocation,

2716
01:31:19,111 --> 01:31:21,210
you love doing it and you get paid for it,

2717
01:31:21,240 --> 01:31:24,480
then you're just double blessed and
then you got it right because you enjoy

2718
01:31:24,481 --> 01:31:26,460
doing this and it works
out and that's good.

2719
01:31:26,490 --> 01:31:26,701
Yeah.

2720
01:31:26,701 --> 01:31:29,200
You catch lucky breaks if you the image,

2721
01:31:29,420 --> 01:31:30,253
but that's,

2722
01:31:30,300 --> 01:31:30,571
boy,

2723
01:31:30,571 --> 01:31:31,404
that's lucky.

2724
01:31:32,820 --> 01:31:33,653
Yeah,

2725
01:31:33,750 --> 01:31:34,583
it is.

2726
01:31:34,590 --> 01:31:38,340
And if I just think if you're
in your life and theirs,

2727
01:31:38,370 --> 01:31:40,920
you don't have something
that you're passionate about.

2728
01:31:41,490 --> 01:31:42,240
I mean,

2729
01:31:42,240 --> 01:31:45,660
and I don't mean that in a cliche way.

2730
01:31:46,890 --> 01:31:50,760
If there's not something where you wake
up every day and there's nothing in your

2731
01:31:50,761 --> 01:31:52,860
life that you're excited to do,

2732
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:54,630
man,

2733
01:31:54,630 --> 01:31:56,910
you need to go back to the drawing board.

2734
01:31:56,911 --> 01:31:57,460
Yeah.

2735
01:31:57,460 --> 01:32:01,390
Because if all you're doing
is just grinding it out,

2736
01:32:02,050 --> 01:32:02,890
you get up everyday,

2737
01:32:02,980 --> 01:32:04,720
go to a job you don't like,

2738
01:32:04,750 --> 01:32:09,750
do task you don't care to do and come
home to a home you don't want to come home

2739
01:32:10,481 --> 01:32:12,880
to and wait to get them to
do it again the next day

2740
01:32:14,440 --> 01:32:15,640
you're burning daylight.

2741
01:32:15,640 --> 01:32:17,980
What the Hell existences that.

2742
01:32:18,040 --> 01:32:19,210
I just,

2743
01:32:19,270 --> 01:32:20,103
I don't,

2744
01:32:20,470 --> 01:32:21,580
I don't understand that,

2745
01:32:21,610 --> 01:32:23,260
that find something.

2746
01:32:23,300 --> 01:32:28,300
I don't care if it's gardening or
music or art or athletics or something.

2747
01:32:28,661 --> 01:32:30,640
Find something you're excited to do.

2748
01:32:31,090 --> 01:32:35,230
Expose yourself to different things with
that very purpose of finding something

2749
01:32:35,231 --> 01:32:37,390
that you love because
the assumption out there,

2750
01:32:37,470 --> 01:32:38,350
there's something out there.

2751
01:32:38,351 --> 01:32:39,550
I guarantee you something.

2752
01:32:39,650 --> 01:32:40,090
Yeah.

2753
01:32:40,090 --> 01:32:41,170
There's something healthy.

2754
01:32:42,040 --> 01:32:43,300
It's not illegal.

2755
01:32:43,600 --> 01:32:45,220
It's not going to be high risk.

2756
01:32:45,221 --> 01:32:49,120
There's something you can do that's not
going to kill you or put you in jail

2757
01:32:49,121 --> 01:32:50,200
that you can be excited about.

2758
01:32:50,650 --> 01:32:51,101
Yeah.

2759
01:32:51,101 --> 01:32:51,890
And I think it's,

2760
01:32:51,890 --> 01:32:52,540
uh,

2761
01:32:52,540 --> 01:32:56,890
one of the most important things to do
when you're a parent is to try to expose

2762
01:32:56,891 --> 01:33:00,520
your kids to as many different things as
possible to find those things for them.

2763
01:33:01,110 --> 01:33:01,450
Yeah.

2764
01:33:01,450 --> 01:33:02,080
And I,

2765
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:03,550
I got two boys as you know,

2766
01:33:04,150 --> 01:33:04,841
and you know,

2767
01:33:04,841 --> 01:33:05,830
one of them really well,

2768
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:10,920
and I did that growing up because my dad
never took me hunting a single day in

2769
01:33:11,141 --> 01:33:11,620
his life.

2770
01:33:11,620 --> 01:33:14,080
He never took me fishing
a single day in his life.

2771
01:33:14,081 --> 01:33:16,390
He never took me camping
a single day in his life.

2772
01:33:17,170 --> 01:33:18,610
He never took me to the lake.

2773
01:33:18,670 --> 01:33:19,750
He never took me skiing,

2774
01:33:19,751 --> 01:33:20,081
boating,

2775
01:33:20,081 --> 01:33:20,471
anything.

2776
01:33:20,471 --> 01:33:21,304
So I,

2777
01:33:21,340 --> 01:33:23,440
I took them to all of those things.

2778
01:33:23,710 --> 01:33:24,460
I didn't know.

2779
01:33:24,460 --> 01:33:26,080
I had no clue what I was doing,

2780
01:33:26,830 --> 01:33:28,990
but I took him Turkey hunting,

2781
01:33:28,991 --> 01:33:29,651
duck hunting,

2782
01:33:29,651 --> 01:33:30,520
deer hunting,

2783
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:32,320
she's skiing,

2784
01:33:32,321 --> 01:33:33,340
snow skiing,

2785
01:33:33,370 --> 01:33:34,203
camping.

2786
01:33:34,450 --> 01:33:35,350
I did it all.

2787
01:33:36,130 --> 01:33:38,920
And to see what they liked,

2788
01:33:38,921 --> 01:33:39,820
let them pick.

2789
01:33:40,390 --> 01:33:41,350
And boy,

2790
01:33:41,351 --> 01:33:44,710
when you don't know what
you're doing as a dad,

2791
01:33:45,220 --> 01:33:46,180
that's a bitch.

2792
01:33:46,360 --> 01:33:47,170
Yeah.

2793
01:33:47,170 --> 01:33:47,381
I mean,

2794
01:33:47,381 --> 01:33:49,130
just little things like you,

2795
01:33:49,300 --> 01:33:54,190
you go camping and you don't realize
that sit in your 10 up on the side of a

2796
01:33:54,191 --> 01:33:55,024
hill,

2797
01:33:55,540 --> 01:33:59,170
even if it's like eight or
10 degrees is a bad idea.

2798
01:33:59,230 --> 01:33:59,421
Yeah.

2799
01:33:59,421 --> 01:33:59,860
Sleep.

2800
01:33:59,860 --> 01:34:01,420
You've got to get on flat ground.

2801
01:34:01,450 --> 01:34:01,691
I mean,

2802
01:34:01,691 --> 01:34:02,710
it looks flat to me,

2803
01:34:02,711 --> 01:34:05,620
but I spent the night try not
to roll down to Damn Hill.

2804
01:34:05,620 --> 01:34:07,420
It didn't look like it was on a slant,

2805
01:34:07,421 --> 01:34:08,254
but it was,

2806
01:34:08,710 --> 01:34:10,720
but you figure these
things out as you go along.

2807
01:34:10,721 --> 01:34:15,280
But I was glad I gave him those
experiences so they could choose.

2808
01:34:15,281 --> 01:34:15,911
And they did.

2809
01:34:15,911 --> 01:34:16,220
And they will.

2810
01:34:16,220 --> 01:34:17,560
And there's some of it
they liked some of it.

2811
01:34:17,561 --> 01:34:18,220
They didn't,

2812
01:34:18,220 --> 01:34:19,390
well I don't know both the kids,

2813
01:34:19,391 --> 01:34:20,810
but I love J.

2814
01:34:20,810 --> 01:34:21,643
Yeah.

2815
01:34:21,750 --> 01:34:22,060
Yeah.

2816
01:34:22,060 --> 01:34:22,841
Jay loves you.

2817
01:34:22,841 --> 01:34:26,560
He really enjoys spending time with
you guys and traveling with you guys.

2818
01:34:26,561 --> 01:34:27,290
And Yeah,

2819
01:34:27,290 --> 01:34:29,710
we've had a bunch of great trips.

2820
01:34:30,160 --> 01:34:31,120
He's an awesome guy.

2821
01:34:31,380 --> 01:34:32,950
He really is so much fun.

2822
01:34:33,100 --> 01:34:33,371
Yeah.

2823
01:34:33,371 --> 01:34:33,580
He,

2824
01:34:33,580 --> 01:34:35,080
he knows how to have a good time.

2825
01:34:35,081 --> 01:34:36,460
And he says the same thing about you.

2826
01:34:36,461 --> 01:34:36,670
He's,

2827
01:34:36,670 --> 01:34:37,870
you know how to have a good time.

2828
01:34:38,220 --> 01:34:38,910
Yeah.

2829
01:34:38,910 --> 01:34:39,743
Yeah.

2830
01:34:39,970 --> 01:34:40,121
Well,

2831
01:34:40,121 --> 01:34:40,860
listen man,

2832
01:34:40,860 --> 01:34:41,120
uh,

2833
01:34:41,120 --> 01:34:42,910
tell people how to get
ahold of your podcasts.

2834
01:34:42,911 --> 01:34:43,600
Where can they get it?

2835
01:34:43,600 --> 01:34:43,990
Well,

2836
01:34:43,990 --> 01:34:46,210
it's fill in the blanks and uh,

2837
01:34:46,230 --> 01:34:49,640
that's p h I l in the blanks and uh,

2838
01:34:49,700 --> 01:34:49,900
yeah,

2839
01:34:49,900 --> 01:34:51,010
I guess you get it everywhere.

2840
01:34:51,010 --> 01:34:52,430
Podcasts are gotten right yet.

2841
01:34:52,750 --> 01:34:53,140
Tones,

2842
01:34:53,140 --> 01:34:53,860
all that jazz,

2843
01:34:53,860 --> 01:34:54,521
iTunes,

2844
01:34:54,521 --> 01:34:55,151
apple,

2845
01:34:55,151 --> 01:34:56,320
a stitcher,

2846
01:34:56,350 --> 01:34:58,420
all the different places that
you're doing right there.

2847
01:34:59,000 --> 01:34:59,960
He handsome faster.

2848
01:34:59,961 --> 01:35:00,081
Yeah.

2849
01:35:00,081 --> 01:35:00,914
Look at that.

2850
01:35:00,980 --> 01:35:01,281
I mean,

2851
01:35:01,281 --> 01:35:02,260
how bout that thing up?

2852
01:35:02,330 --> 01:35:02,900
Nice.

2853
01:35:02,900 --> 01:35:04,260
I'll do clean up pretty good though.

2854
01:35:04,740 --> 01:35:05,040
I see.

2855
01:35:05,040 --> 01:35:07,760
The good thing about being bald
as you look the same all the time,

2856
01:35:07,761 --> 01:35:07,911
right?

2857
01:35:07,911 --> 01:35:08,220
Yes,

2858
01:35:08,220 --> 01:35:09,053
that's true.

2859
01:35:09,080 --> 01:35:10,430
And you save money on shampoo.

2860
01:35:10,460 --> 01:35:11,750
You shaved money on shampoo.

2861
01:35:11,751 --> 01:35:16,751
And I've been bald since I was like 12
so really my hair fell out really early.

2862
01:35:17,480 --> 01:35:18,313
Wow.

2863
01:35:18,410 --> 01:35:20,180
I remember playing college football.

2864
01:35:20,181 --> 01:35:23,840
I'd take my helmet off and it looked
like I had an animal in there.

2865
01:35:25,130 --> 01:35:26,090
Once a pill,

2866
01:35:26,630 --> 01:35:27,560
it's going on here.

2867
01:35:27,940 --> 01:35:28,361
My team,

2868
01:35:28,361 --> 01:35:30,830
I should say what the
hill is in your helmet.

2869
01:35:30,831 --> 01:35:32,030
It's my hair shut up.

2870
01:35:33,440 --> 01:35:34,071
I don't know why,

2871
01:35:34,071 --> 01:35:35,060
but it just fell out.

2872
01:35:35,061 --> 01:35:37,610
I guess he got knocked out
or the mustache works too.

2873
01:35:37,730 --> 01:35:38,001
Yeah.

2874
01:35:38,001 --> 01:35:40,150
Well some a lot of guys
can't rock a mustache.

2875
01:35:40,220 --> 01:35:41,480
I'd look a little creepy with one.

2876
01:35:41,690 --> 01:35:42,080
Yeah.

2877
01:35:42,080 --> 01:35:44,810
Well I tried to keep it where
it doesn't look like total porn.

2878
01:35:46,670 --> 01:35:47,503
That's tough.

2879
01:35:48,190 --> 01:35:49,011
How do you do that?

2880
01:35:49,011 --> 01:35:50,720
You got to embrace your weaknesses.

2881
01:35:50,721 --> 01:35:51,020
You know,

2882
01:35:51,020 --> 01:35:51,440
I mean,

2883
01:35:51,440 --> 01:35:53,810
I remember when I wrote
my first book on Oprah,

2884
01:35:53,811 --> 01:35:54,510
she said,

2885
01:35:54,510 --> 01:35:56,370
you'll you won't have
any trouble finding it.

2886
01:35:56,371 --> 01:35:59,120
It's got these big old ball head
right there on the front of it.

2887
01:35:59,121 --> 01:35:59,471
So I figure,

2888
01:35:59,471 --> 01:35:59,751
you know,

2889
01:35:59,751 --> 01:36:00,051
hell,

2890
01:36:00,051 --> 01:36:01,130
make it a trademark.

2891
01:36:01,131 --> 01:36:01,390
Right.

2892
01:36:01,390 --> 01:36:02,300
For went hard on Ya.

2893
01:36:02,360 --> 01:36:02,751
Yeah,

2894
01:36:02,751 --> 01:36:03,800
she did in the beginning.

2895
01:36:04,040 --> 01:36:05,330
I got no complaints.

2896
01:36:05,550 --> 01:36:05,960
Oh,

2897
01:36:05,960 --> 01:36:06,500
I hear you.

2898
01:36:06,500 --> 01:36:07,850
She treated me pretty right.

2899
01:36:07,940 --> 01:36:08,151
Yeah,

2900
01:36:08,151 --> 01:36:09,080
it worked out great.

2901
01:36:09,140 --> 01:36:09,351
Hey,

2902
01:36:09,351 --> 01:36:10,750
thanks for having me on my pleasure.

2903
01:36:10,760 --> 01:36:11,870
You got to come do mine.

2904
01:36:12,080 --> 01:36:12,913
Absolutely.

2905
01:36:13,400 --> 01:36:13,850
Alright,

2906
01:36:13,850 --> 01:36:14,683
thanks man.

2907
01:36:14,720 --> 01:36:15,361
Dr Phil,

2908
01:36:15,361 --> 01:36:15,980
Ladies and Gentlemen.
