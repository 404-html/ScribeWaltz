1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:04,140
He's 55 now,
dog.

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,450
Mommy's put your jeans up high and 
tight.

3
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:10,560
Chris.
Christina,

4
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:16,130
I'm so honored that you did that.
Put it in the instagram post.

5
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:18,960
Oh,
I can't believe it.

6
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:21,350
I don't even know what it means.
You don't.

7
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,433
I still don't.
I remember being on your show and I was 

8
00:00:23,761 --> 00:00:25,170
like,
what is Mommy's mean?

9
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:27,120
What does everybody call you guys?
Genes.

10
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:30,450
It's just stupid.
It really started with like,

11
00:00:30,451 --> 00:00:31,284
what's the dumbest thing we could call a
show your mom's house talking about 

12
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:38,160
genes and mommies and it's dumb on that 
forest.

13
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:39,960
But it's hilarious.
Like your,

14
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:42,300
your shows a very fun,
silly show you,

15
00:00:42,301 --> 00:00:45,180
you guys obviously have a good time.
We have the best time.

16
00:00:45,181 --> 00:00:49,410
It is like it's how Tom and I normally 
are and then we just put microphones.

17
00:00:49,411 --> 00:00:53,970
Which is good.
It's a stupid farts and I don't know.

18
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:54,420
I love it.

19
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:55,980
I feel like too,
I feel like we,

20
00:00:55,981 --> 00:00:58,320
uh,
we serve a demographic like,

21
00:00:58,321 --> 00:00:58,891
okay,
for instance,

22
00:00:58,891 --> 00:00:59,724
I was at the rite aid.
I was going to go use the toilet and 

23
00:01:01,621 --> 00:01:04,320
this guy stocking the shelves goes 
Christina p.

24
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:05,600
and I was like,
yeah,

25
00:01:05,601 --> 00:01:06,480
how do you know?
And he's like,

26
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:09,900
I'm a mommy and this is fucking awesome.
Like this is,

27
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:10,823
these are the people,
the people that are stocking shit and 

28
00:01:13,021 --> 00:01:16,800
driving the trucks and like sitting in 
cubicles and these days,

29
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:21,240
the podcasting world of humans,
people that are doing other stuff.

30
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,390
Yeah,
yeah.

31
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:24,600
Yeah.
So not like watching a show,

32
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:26,520
like if you're watching a show for the 
most part,

33
00:01:26,521 --> 00:01:29,340
you're sitting down and watching it,
but if you like listening to a podcast,

34
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:31,980
you're doing other stuff of cleaning the
house,

35
00:01:31,981 --> 00:01:32,814
doing whatever and you know,
laughing and you guys put up fucking 

36
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:36,690
around those as well.

37
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:41,070
Like how much of your show is video?
Like what percentage of your audience.

38
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,690
Oh,
that's funny.

39
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:43,830
Video stuff.
What do you mean?

40
00:01:43,831 --> 00:01:44,664
Who Watches Youtube stuff?
Like what's the difference between like 

41
00:01:46,351 --> 00:01:49,290
the Youtube bonds versus the audio?
It's smaller,

42
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:51,770
but yeah,
the audio is the hardcores and then.

43
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:53,460
And then interesting videos.
Secondary.

44
00:01:53,461 --> 00:01:54,990
Yeah.
But a lot of people would have thought,

45
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:58,230
no way,
like videos always going to be seeing it

46
00:01:58,231 --> 00:01:59,970
as better because it's an added element.
Yeah.

47
00:01:59,971 --> 00:02:00,804
But I have a theory,
it's because our show we play like a 

48
00:02:02,521 --> 00:02:03,354
porno clips in the towns and stuff 
that's not appropriate for the 

49
00:02:06,631 --> 00:02:07,464
workplace.
So if you've got youtube on your 

50
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:12,180
earplugs at your state,
your speakers or whatever,

51
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:17,200
and then it's all fuck me and then fired
from your job.

52
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:23,460
Her God damn.
I can't believe Tommy met her.

53
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:24,713
I know.
And I was like texting him like don't 

54
00:02:26,311 --> 00:02:27,144
forget your family.
You have a child with me like you would 

55
00:02:32,041 --> 00:02:32,910
ever,
you know.

56
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:34,320
Yeah,
I know.

57
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:36,180
No,
I can't.

58
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:38,910
That's the craziest part.
But yeah,

59
00:02:38,911 --> 00:02:40,620
it's been a great show and it's,
you know,

60
00:02:40,621 --> 00:02:41,454
we have you to thank because you were 
the one that told us to start it until 

61
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,260
everybody started though back in the 
day.

62
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:51,380
But you got to do a podcast to do 100 
people.

63
00:02:51,931 --> 00:02:56,910
But luckily 50 of them listened.
Thank God 30 probably.

64
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:57,773
But some of them are really good.
There's some really good podcasts that 

65
00:02:59,651 --> 00:03:00,040
have come out

66
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,170
of my stupid stone suggestions.

67
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:04,910
Are you kidding me?
You're the great motivator.

68
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:05,803
The great challenger,
the great beginner of fat shaming 

69
00:03:08,031 --> 00:03:09,720
campaigns.
That was great.

70
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:10,783
I can't take credit for that.
That fat shame was all Bert and tom 

71
00:03:12,831 --> 00:03:14,820
talking shit to each other,
but don't put that.

72
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:17,570
But then you came up with the idea to 
have the challenge.

73
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,240
The challenge.

74
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,380
Yes.
The weight loss contest.

75
00:03:19,381 --> 00:03:21,090
Well we sat down,
we tried to figure out what to do,

76
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:24,040
which we should have like something fun,
like some sort of.

77
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:25,053
Because there's also an issue that's 
going on like it's going on right now 

78
00:03:27,751 --> 00:03:28,584
with Ari and it was going on with them 
where people on the outside think it's 

79
00:03:31,801 --> 00:03:34,470
serious and this is probably a good time
to address this.

80
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:38,140
Like people on the outside of things 
that were actually mad at Ari.

81
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:41,760
Ari is actually like not good for his 
word.

82
00:03:41,761 --> 00:03:42,760
That's.
This is a,

83
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:44,880
these are jokes folks were fucking 
around.

84
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:46,043
You know,
I mean this is all just and so all you 

85
00:03:48,151 --> 00:03:53,040
people that take it seriously don't take
anything unless we say this is serious.

86
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:54,023
Don't take it seriously.
Like all that bird is fat thomas fats 

87
00:03:55,991 --> 00:03:56,700
up.
They were,

88
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,290
we were having a great time with it.

89
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:00,720
They were having fun with it and the Ra,
a welter stuff.

90
00:04:00,721 --> 00:04:02,160
That stuff is bullshit.
All right.

91
00:04:02,161 --> 00:04:02,994
Red is like for real.
One of the most honest guys I've ever 

92
00:04:06,391 --> 00:04:07,224
met in my life and for sure he wasn't 
excited about paying for those guys to 

93
00:04:10,831 --> 00:04:11,664
go to fucking Europe for a soccer game.
That doesn't mean he wouldn't have 

94
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:14,963
honored this bet,
but then it got complicated because I 

95
00:04:17,011 --> 00:04:20,130
paid for the bat and I sent those guys 
to a basketball game.

96
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:22,920
What was the game again?
Cavs warriors.

97
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:24,090
Is that a big game?
It was,

98
00:04:24,091 --> 00:04:24,811
yeah,
for sure.

99
00:04:24,811 --> 00:04:26,190
At the time.
I don't understand.

100
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,610
Do you get it?
Do I get it?

101
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:30,870
Go to a basketball game.

102
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:32,380
The most boring thing in the world for 
me,

103
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:33,263
watched some guys throw a ball.
Players in the world are in those two 

104
00:04:34,981 --> 00:04:35,814
teams.
Did they do really good at throwing the 

105
00:04:38,071 --> 00:04:39,900
ball in the hole?
Really,

106
00:04:39,901 --> 00:04:42,510
really good at it.
He didn't do you like sports at all?

107
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:46,740
Really?
But I thought for sure not football.

108
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:47,790
No.
I get so bored.

109
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:49,133
Bored the shit out of me too,
and Tom's been trying to explain this 

110
00:04:52,261 --> 00:04:54,230
shit to me for years and I'm like,
I don't.

111
00:04:54,231 --> 00:04:54,961
I don't.
Okay.

112
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:55,794
They run five seconds and then the start
and then and then comes the show after 

113
00:04:58,621 --> 00:05:01,830
the show or the four white guys talk 
about the fucking game.

114
00:05:01,831 --> 00:05:02,664
They just watched for two more hours 
making the stupid jokes that fucking 

115
00:05:07,201 --> 00:05:09,630
white guys that do the fucking 
commentary in there.

116
00:05:09,631 --> 00:05:11,850
The worst.
You can't find funnier.

117
00:05:11,851 --> 00:05:14,130
People that skip bayless kids,
that's his name,

118
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,510
but could you imagine being stuck on a 
plane with that guy right now?

119
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:20,370
He just keeps talking to you with shit 
breath.

120
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:22,920
Oh God,
yeah.

121
00:05:22,921 --> 00:05:25,290
I'll do a bad guy.
I shouldn't talk shit.

122
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:26,670
Terrible,
terrible person.

123
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:27,990
I'm sure.
And they're all,

124
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:29,070
you know,
dogs.

125
00:05:29,071 --> 00:05:32,160
They're all bad looking dudes.
You know what I like?

126
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:34,230
Terrible boring things though.
I like.

127
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:35,093
I watch,
I've watched professional pool hunting 

128
00:05:38,401 --> 00:05:41,100
shows like my wife comes home and she 
looks at our dvr.

129
00:05:41,101 --> 00:05:43,620
She's like,
what the fuck is wrong with you?

130
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:46,840
This is the dvr.
Kickboxing,

131
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:49,120
MMA,
a bow hunting,

132
00:05:49,121 --> 00:05:50,320
bow hunting,
bow hunting,

133
00:05:50,321 --> 00:05:51,670
bow hunting.
You know,

134
00:05:51,671 --> 00:05:55,960
like a real crime stories like what the 
fuck is wrong with you?

135
00:05:55,961 --> 00:05:56,930
Like murder,
killing,

136
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:57,980
killing,
punching,

137
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:58,813
murder.
So it's like most of it though is 

138
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:04,040
hunting.
I'm so obsessed with hunting.

139
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:08,420
Most of my dvr is like these bowhunting 
show that's your jam.

140
00:06:08,421 --> 00:06:09,254
So that's your hobby.
And Are you watching it for tips and 

141
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,260
figure out what to do in certain 
situations,

142
00:06:15,261 --> 00:06:17,450
which seems ridiculous.
Like would just shoot the animal.

143
00:06:17,451 --> 00:06:18,380
What the fuck?
Get near it.

144
00:06:18,381 --> 00:06:19,370
Shoot it.
It's,

145
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:22,280
it's one of those things on the outside 
it looks like very simple,

146
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:25,490
but on the inside it's very complex.
That's how everything.

147
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:26,750
Okay.
Like surfing,

148
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:28,580
that's super easy.
No,

149
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,760
it was like the hardest fucking thing in
the world to learn to do.

150
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:33,980
Have you ever seen an indoor one?
No,

151
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:35,620
dude,
they have these indoor ones.

152
00:06:35,621 --> 00:06:36,240
They have a woman,

153
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,880
Austin Bro.
You get on a surfboard and you,

154
00:06:38,881 --> 00:06:41,790
you can go on it for like 10 minutes.
Like they say.

155
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:45,930
It's an amazing way to get good because 
you don't have to wait for waves.

156
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:49,050
It's a machine.
So there's this huge pool.

157
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:52,860
You get in there with a surfboard and 
you surf like fucking crazy and you just

158
00:06:52,861 --> 00:06:55,020
keep doing it and you don't have to 
paddle.

159
00:06:55,021 --> 00:06:55,854
Paddle,
paddle out turned the fucking board 

160
00:06:57,141 --> 00:06:57,974
around.

161
00:06:58,620 --> 00:06:59,670
Well,
it's also your whole.

162
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:03,210
I would imagine you're developing those 
stabilizer muscles,

163
00:07:03,211 --> 00:07:04,044
right?
Like I was talking to guys that have 

164
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:10,380
looked at that like,
look,

165
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:14,070
you just surf around and you get used to
like balancing.

166
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:16,890
So this would be a good way.
I don't like that guy.

167
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:19,290
Just kidding.
Just kidding buddy.

168
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:22,270
Fuck that guy.
Like his face is.

169
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:25,500
It'd be a good way to develop all those 
weird.

170
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:26,463
Like that's one of the things that you 
realize when you start doing yoga is 

171
00:07:28,681 --> 00:07:31,550
that there's all these weird muscles 
that you didn't know that were weak,

172
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:34,080
like these weird stabilizer muscles in 
your feet.

173
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:37,500
Like the number one thing that bothered 
me when I first started doing yoga is my

174
00:07:37,501 --> 00:07:39,240
feet.
My feet would give out before anything.

175
00:07:39,241 --> 00:07:40,470
I was like,
this is so weird.

176
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:42,930
They would just give out your ankles.
You mean?

177
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:43,783
Oh my feet like the heel because you're 
standing on one foot and you're 

178
00:07:46,771 --> 00:07:49,080
balancing so your foot has to kind of 
like do all this,

179
00:07:49,081 --> 00:07:49,720
like,
you know,

180
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:52,740
like adjusting and while that's 
happening they're like,

181
00:07:52,741 --> 00:07:53,574
my foot's getting fatigued,
like the arch of my foot starts hurting 

182
00:07:55,681 --> 00:07:56,670
and I have to put it down.

183
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:58,013
Damn.
Yeah.

184
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:00,570
That's like,
it took me a long time to get past that.

185
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:01,613
Well,
so now were you a huge fan of hot yoga 

186
00:08:03,281 --> 00:08:06,700
before you came up with this challenge?

187
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:08,560
Yeah,
I've been doing it for a few years now.

188
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:11,140
Doing it.
It's pretty seriously for two years.

189
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,630
I did it on and off for a couple of 
years before that,

190
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:18,810
but I got real serious about two years 
and two months ago.

191
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:20,770
I just started doing it every week.
Now.

192
00:08:20,771 --> 00:08:24,550
What's the benefit of the heat?
Cold heat shock proteins.

193
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:27,340
There's a,
and this hasn't been proven,

194
00:08:27,341 --> 00:08:28,174
but there's the study they're doing 
right now I think at Harvard about this 

195
00:08:30,281 --> 00:08:31,114
because it's been proven that sauna,
there's a woman that I have on the 

196
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:36,160
podcast all the time.
She's brilliant.

197
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:40,570
Her name is Dr Rhonda Patrick and she's 
like one of my favorite people and her,

198
00:08:40,571 --> 00:08:43,510
um,
she's done a bunch of work on Saunas.

199
00:08:43,511 --> 00:08:44,344
She's kind of obsessed with cryotherapy,
cold shock proteins and heat shock 

200
00:08:47,321 --> 00:08:50,860
proteins and your body has a response to
extreme heat,

201
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:54,760
extreme cold by producing these anti 
inflammatory.

202
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:56,813
And when you go into a hot sauna,
I think it's four times a week if you 

203
00:09:00,871 --> 00:09:01,704
could do it four times a week,
it reduces mortality amongst all causes 

204
00:09:04,981 --> 00:09:07,070
by 40 percent,
no shed,

205
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,040
stroke,
heart attack,

206
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:08,874
cancer,
everything.

207
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:09,923
And it's because most of the issues that
people have health wise stem from 

208
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,350
inflammation and inflammation from 
sugar,

209
00:09:16,351 --> 00:09:18,020
poor diet,
but it's all,

210
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:21,750
you can mitigate a lot of that 
inflammation with sauna.

211
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:22,913
And I think yoga mimics the sauna 
because it is so fucking hot in the 

212
00:09:27,871 --> 00:09:28,171
room,
right?

213
00:09:28,171 --> 00:09:31,980
The room is 105 degrees and then once 
you start exercising,

214
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:34,760
your body is through the roof.
I mean I am like,

215
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,633
a lot of times they're doing poses and I
have my arm straight out and I'm 

216
00:09:37,351 --> 00:09:40,950
watching water just poor out of my body 
under the ground.

217
00:09:40,951 --> 00:09:42,000
I don't have a shirt on,
right,

218
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,220
so it's not like it's coming out of a 
wet shirt.

219
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:47,010
It's just pouring off my body trip,
trip,

220
00:09:47,011 --> 00:09:47,551
trip,
trip,

221
00:09:47,551 --> 00:09:52,551
just squeezing all the water out of my 
body and I drink a large 64 ounce bottle

222
00:09:53,371 --> 00:09:55,920
of water with ice during the entire 
class.

223
00:09:55,921 --> 00:09:59,220
So in that 90 minute class,
I'm 64 ounces of water.

224
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:03,570
Yeah.
So there's a tremendous amount of stress

225
00:10:03,571 --> 00:10:07,050
on your body from that heat and from the
poses themselves.

226
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:08,490
And so,
uh,

227
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:09,383
I would like to see what happens when 
the results of this study come back 

228
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,593
because I think they're going to show 
probably a similar effect to like the 

229
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:18,750
anti inflammatory markers in the blood 
that you see from sauna.

230
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:20,100
That's.
I did not know.

231
00:10:20,101 --> 00:10:20,934
That song is amazing.
If you can get a sauna like near your 

232
00:10:23,221 --> 00:10:24,200
house.
Why now?

233
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:26,160
We're just talking about this morning,
man.

234
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,620
They them that you can install a small 
one.

235
00:10:28,621 --> 00:10:30,150
Like the new studio has a sauna.

236
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:31,670
Do it.
You can come on over.

237
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:34,650
I'll tell you why.
That's so crazy.

238
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:35,720
Yeah,
I'm on that.

239
00:10:35,721 --> 00:10:38,970
A primal diet had been done subsistence 
diet.

240
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:40,200
Yeah.
For like,

241
00:10:40,201 --> 00:10:41,730
I don't know,
almost a year now.

242
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,530
That's the big thing.
She says,

243
00:10:43,531 --> 00:10:44,364
my trainer,
I'd take,

244
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:46,990
she said it's the inflammation,
it's the inflammation,

245
00:10:46,991 --> 00:10:48,950
you know?
Yup,

246
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,550
Yup.
No,

247
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,980
I see.
I got it from a woman once.

248
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:56,070
She told me she's a trainer and she 
said,

249
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,353
and she was talking to me about back 
issues and issues that people have and 

250
00:11:00,901 --> 00:11:03,660
she was one of the,
this is going to sound really weird,

251
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,673
but one of the best ways that we figured
out how to help people with back issues 

252
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:10,320
is a,
get them to go on a gluten free diet.

253
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:11,960
And I was like,
what's this?

254
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:12,803
This was a few years back.
I was having some neck problems and she 

255
00:11:16,471 --> 00:11:18,060
was almost like a gluten free diet.

256
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:18,781
Why?
And she's like,

257
00:11:18,781 --> 00:11:20,290
well,
gluten causes inflammation.

258
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:21,690
A lot of people.
I was like,

259
00:11:21,691 --> 00:11:22,524
oh,
that sounds like some new age hippie 

260
00:11:23,101 --> 00:11:23,934
bullshit.
Right.

261
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:25,950
So then I started looking into it and 
then I realized like,

262
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,180
oh,
there's something to this.

263
00:11:27,181 --> 00:11:27,841
And then I'm like,
oh,

264
00:11:27,841 --> 00:11:28,674
it's not just gluten,
it's actually refined carbohydrates and 

265
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:35,280
refined sugars and all that stuff.
But gluten to,

266
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:36,330
you know,
um,

267
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,970
maynard from tool,
you know,

268
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:41,580
that dude and Keenan tool is,
he's awesome.

269
00:11:41,581 --> 00:11:42,414
It's a really good dude.
But he also has his own vineyard and an 

270
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:48,120
a in a restaurant in Austria.
You ever doing an Australia is a,

271
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:49,013
I didn't know until he told me it's a 
small restaurant that serves like small 

272
00:11:52,591 --> 00:11:54,100
plates.
It's like sorta like

273
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:57,020
Tapa.
So that's like a similar career path,

274
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,510
I don't know.
But anyway,

275
00:11:58,750 --> 00:11:59,583
he has um,
they serve pasta that is heirloom pasta 

276
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:04,241
and I'm like,
well,

277
00:12:04,241 --> 00:12:04,961
what do you mean?
He's like,

278
00:12:04,961 --> 00:12:08,920
we'll use heirloom wheat because the 
wheat that they used to sell,

279
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:09,561
like W,
we,

280
00:12:09,561 --> 00:12:10,394
we,
that people used to grow like way back 

281
00:12:11,771 --> 00:12:14,350
in the early days was much more low 
yield,

282
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:15,813
I'd say the same thing that people have 
done to tomatoes and a lot of things by 

283
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:21,490
making them more robust.
When they did this to wheat,

284
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:24,520
they,
they made a much higher yield wheat.

285
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:27,460
So if you have an acre of wheat,
you get much more wheat out of it.

286
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,860
But it has much more complex gluten's in
it.

287
00:12:29,861 --> 00:12:31,960
And it's more difficult for your body to
process.

288
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,153
So one of the things that I noticed when
we went to Italy is I was eating pasta 

289
00:12:37,331 --> 00:12:38,164
over there and it didn't get me this 
horrible brick in my stomach feeling 

290
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:44,570
like you want to die is this,
why is it different?

291
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:46,000
And he was explaining,
he was like,

292
00:12:46,001 --> 00:12:49,780
your body is struggling to process this 
modern gluten,

293
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:54,400
this modern wheat,
but he sells this stuff that's heirloom.

294
00:12:54,401 --> 00:12:57,550
Just sorta like those ugly tomatoes,
those delicious heirloom tomatoes.

295
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:58,840
Yes.
Same thing.

296
00:12:58,841 --> 00:13:02,980
That's what a tomato used to be like.
They used to be this like weird,

297
00:13:02,981 --> 00:13:06,340
funky looking but super delicious.
Almost like a fruit.

298
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:09,820
I don't even eat pasta.
I haven't had it in like a year.

299
00:13:09,821 --> 00:13:10,210
Like,
you know,

300
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:14,350
every now and then I have a nibble,
but the thought of eating a bowl of it,

301
00:13:14,351 --> 00:13:17,280
now it's repulsive.
Empty.

302
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,200
There's no nutrition,
right?

303
00:13:19,201 --> 00:13:21,220
There's nothing in it.
It's just dog shit.

304
00:13:21,221 --> 00:13:23,020
And it's going to turn to slop on your 
body,

305
00:13:23,021 --> 00:13:24,430
you know?
And I don't like it.

306
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,740
Yeah.
I used to love it.

307
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:28,960
I eat it every now and then I'll still 
eat it.

308
00:13:28,961 --> 00:13:29,794
I hate,
the other day I made sausage and put a 

309
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,200
pasta like I bought some of that Italian
pasta.

310
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,250
Yeah,
the real deal.

311
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,270
The real deal.
You get it.

312
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:41,800
I think it's called double zero wheat.
They have.

313
00:13:41,801 --> 00:13:42,634
Yeah.
That's what it is.

314
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:45,940
And you can get it from Italy,
like get it on Amazon.com.

315
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:48,290
Nice.
Yeah.

316
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:48,970
Because,
uh,

317
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:52,660
I order eggs that are like super organic
fancy ones to the eggs.

318
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:54,310
Do you have chickens?

319
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:58,930
Fresh eggs.
Do you guys have a nice yard?

320
00:13:58,931 --> 00:14:02,470
Did you get into a little chicken coop?
See,

321
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,620
Jamie was good.
No.

322
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:06,730
Yeah,
I uh,

323
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:08,190
I want to get chickens.
Yeah,

324
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:09,170
because I like,
you know,

325
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:11,700
in Europe the yolks are nice and bright 
orange.

326
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:15,040
It shouldn't be yellow.
No really nasty.

327
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:15,883
No,
that's why you see vegetarian fed 

328
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:20,260
chickens,
like they don't want that.

329
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:23,590
Chickens want bugs and worms and beetles
and mice.

330
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,780
They're little monsters.
They nasty,

331
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,550
nasty,
nasty shit.

332
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,040
But it's such a good deal.
Like you give them food,

333
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:30,874
you let him roam around your yard,
they pluck at the grass and they eat 

334
00:14:32,831 --> 00:14:35,200
bugs and you know,
and they give you eggs.

335
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:36,910
It's like a super sweet deal.
Now,

336
00:14:36,911 --> 00:14:38,320
do they?
Shit everywhere.

337
00:14:38,321 --> 00:14:40,990
Everywhere your dog.
You have a dog,

338
00:14:40,991 --> 00:14:41,920
right?
I got two dogs.

339
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:43,570
Okay.
Your dog's going to eat all the chicken.

340
00:14:43,571 --> 00:14:43,870
Shit.

341
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:44,703
It's fucking gross.
Marshall goes in the in the yard and 

342
00:14:46,541 --> 00:14:49,150
just go with chicken shit like Easter 
egg hunt.

343
00:14:49,151 --> 00:14:50,970
So gross circle of life,
right?

344
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:54,530
Just gobbling up chicken turds.
You're like,

345
00:14:54,531 --> 00:14:55,940
dude,
you're so nasty.

346
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:56,983
Nasty dog.
And then he wants to run over and kiss 

347
00:14:58,251 --> 00:14:58,910
you.
Yeah,

348
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:01,170
of course.
And then does he sleep in your bed too?

349
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:03,010
Fucking way?
No,

350
00:15:03,011 --> 00:15:03,844
no,
no,

351
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:04,480
no,
no.

352
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,590
The doggie doggy sleep.
Sleeps in his dog bed.

353
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:08,350
In your room.
No,

354
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:09,120
no,
no,

355
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:09,530
no,
no.

356
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:10,700
Somewhere else in the house?
No,

357
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:12,190
he sleeps in my office.
Oh,

358
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,370
okay.
Dog Bed.

359
00:15:13,371 --> 00:15:16,730
He's got a sweet little setup.
This is the puppy you just got.

360
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,230
Yeah,
he's 11 months now.

361
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:21,950
He's a big boy now.
He's full grown golden retrievers.

362
00:15:21,951 --> 00:15:22,784
They,
they get to be like full grown pretty 

363
00:15:23,301 --> 00:15:25,040
quick.
He's the sweetest dog.

364
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:29,050
They're such great dogs.
They're so loving and they're such smart

365
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:29,900
family dogs.

366
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,550
Yeah.
And it's really smart.

367
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:32,660
You know,
like he,

368
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:34,130
he just,
he gets it,

369
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:35,250
you know,
like you can talk to me,

370
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:36,740
come here buddy.
Like he just comes,

371
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:39,170
he gets it.
He's like no communication with them.

372
00:15:39,171 --> 00:15:40,490
It's very simple,
you know,

373
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:43,130
and he's always happy,
you know,

374
00:15:43,131 --> 00:15:44,640
just a big sweetie.
Yeah.

375
00:15:44,641 --> 00:15:46,450
They have a good demeanor.
Those tax.

376
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,080
Yeah.
Really peaceful.

377
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:50,780
Can he chill alone or does he need to be
with the person?

378
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,830
No,
he chills alone.

379
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:53,293
I can just go,
hey bro wants you to scope out in the 

380
00:15:54,351 --> 00:15:55,184
backyard.
And he goes out in the yard swimming by 

381
00:15:57,591 --> 00:15:59,090
himself,
which is kind of hilarious.

382
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:00,253
Like the pools there and he just dives 
in the water by himself and then as 

383
00:16:04,431 --> 00:16:05,070
he's,
what's,

384
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:05,903
what's really silly is as he's swimming,
he's paddling and he creates these 

385
00:16:09,771 --> 00:16:12,790
splashes and he tries to bite them.
So it's splashed.

386
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:15,800
It's like,
it's so silly.

387
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,010
So silly.
I love doggies.

388
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:20,290
Another great.
I want to hold,

389
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:22,400
I want to like 10 of them.
I have these little shit dogs,

390
00:16:22,401 --> 00:16:23,690
these,
they're called Brussels Griffon.

391
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:24,524
That's my breed.
They look like pugs but with more for 

392
00:16:26,271 --> 00:16:27,950
and they're just so stupid and I love 
them,

393
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:31,390
but they always want to be next to you.
They always want to snuggle course.

394
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,050
You're nice.
I am.

395
00:16:33,051 --> 00:16:34,680
Yeah.
They want to be near Nice,

396
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:37,110
wouldn't it?
I'm very snuggly.

397
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:38,300
I know.
I liked that shit.

398
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:40,550
What do you do?
I don't know.

399
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:43,490
People that don't like dogs,
like what don't you like about them?

400
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:46,640
They're sweet,
but they're loving and they're stoked to

401
00:16:46,641 --> 00:16:47,474
see you all the time.
There was a weird thing though with 

402
00:16:48,921 --> 00:16:51,020
people that only like dogs and don't 
like people,

403
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:53,100
so that's too much,
you know,

404
00:16:53,101 --> 00:16:54,740
it's like your personality probably 
sucks,

405
00:16:54,741 --> 00:16:55,574
man.

406
00:16:57,220 --> 00:17:00,110
The person that's strictly dog.
Is that what you mean?

407
00:17:00,111 --> 00:17:01,310
And I thought,
yeah,

408
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:05,090
that's fucked up therapy problem.
You know,

409
00:17:05,091 --> 00:17:05,924
the next step is people judge people.
There's horse people in my neighborhood 

410
00:17:11,001 --> 00:17:13,580
or judge them.
Uh,

411
00:17:13,581 --> 00:17:15,200
I don't,
I don't like horses.

412
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:16,850
Fuck them.
I don't want to ride them.

413
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:18,710
I don't like them.
And they smell bad.

414
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:20,480
I mean they're pretty firm until the 
Whitney.

415
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,230
No,
I know.

416
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:22,530
I see her on instagram.
She does.

417
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:24,350
She loves her horse.
What is,

418
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:27,380
what do they love so much about these 
horses when these crazy?

419
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,300
Yeah,
she's very smart.

420
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:31,010
Like one of the smartest people I've 
ever met,

421
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:33,490
but she's fucking insane in a good way.
But,

422
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:34,383
but like she has so much information.
Every time I talked to her have to 

423
00:17:36,711 --> 00:17:37,960
google something.
Like what?

424
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:39,840
What does she know about telling me to 
tell me?

425
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:40,930
Dammit.
Weird.

426
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:42,880
She,
she told me about weird violent sports I

427
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:43,910
didn't even know existed.

428
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:45,613
I'm.
One of the things she was telling me is 

429
00:17:46,521 --> 00:17:48,140
why people have a fear of public 
speaking.

430
00:17:48,141 --> 00:17:48,974
This was something that she said the 
last time she was on the podcast and I 

431
00:17:50,281 --> 00:17:51,660
said why?
She's like,

432
00:17:51,661 --> 00:17:54,060
because in the past when you spoke in 
public,

433
00:17:54,061 --> 00:17:57,270
it was because you were trying to make a
case for your survival.

434
00:17:57,330 --> 00:17:58,650
Oh Wow.
That's interesting.

435
00:17:58,651 --> 00:17:59,484
They were looking at you like you fucked
up and there was a big group of people 

436
00:18:02,431 --> 00:18:03,450
judging you.
I was like,

437
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:05,030
oh,
interesting.

438
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:08,460
I would think it's fear of alienation 
from the pack.

439
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:11,820
At the same reason people are afraid of 
success.

440
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:12,923
It's because you don't want to lose your
connection to the tribe because it 

441
00:18:16,111 --> 00:18:18,230
separates you from the tribe.
Well,

442
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,180
as a comic,
don't you notice that when people get to

443
00:18:21,181 --> 00:18:24,390
be a certain level of success,
there's some of them,

444
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:25,283
like some of them,
some of them just stay cool and they 

445
00:18:26,971 --> 00:18:27,900
just hang no matter what.

446
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:28,733
Like Ron White,
Ron Wyden has always just hanging out 

447
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:31,223
and he's about as big as you get.
I mean Ron Wyden is sold out fucking 

448
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:33,713
arenas.
Right?

449
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:35,190
But you know,
you hang with Ronnie,

450
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:36,060
he's like,
hey man,

451
00:18:36,061 --> 00:18:37,290
what's going on?
You know,

452
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:40,300
drank gives you a hug and he's the best.
Right.

453
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:41,543
But like some people they get insulated 
and they get weird and then they lose 

454
00:18:45,781 --> 00:18:48,120
touch with everybody and then their 
comedy suffers.

455
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,233
Yeah.
Well because you can't be removed from 

456
00:18:50,941 --> 00:18:53,940
the world to talk about the world.
That doesn't really work that way,

457
00:18:53,941 --> 00:18:54,830
does it?
No,

458
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:58,130
but I think people,
well I don't know.

459
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:01,170
Like how do you stay normal?
You're super successful.

460
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:04,740
I think one of the reasons,
because I do a lot of other shit,

461
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:05,960
like the yoga.
Yeah.

462
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:07,920
I think doing yoga,
like difficult,

463
00:19:07,921 --> 00:19:09,900
doing Jujitsu,
bowhunting bond,

464
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:11,580
he's one of the hardest things I've ever
done.

465
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:14,640
It's fucking hard.
It's super difficult.

466
00:19:14,641 --> 00:19:15,474
Super difficult to get accurate,
super intense pressure on the line when 

467
00:19:18,601 --> 00:19:21,870
you have to execute a shot and a living 
creature and then you know,

468
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:22,733
just to get obsessed with the whole 
methodology behind it and all the 

469
00:19:26,251 --> 00:19:30,180
technique and all the learning and 
studying it and just.

470
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:34,230
I get obsessed with things,
so like doing things I suck at,

471
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:37,110
like yoga,
bowhunting and Jujitsu.

472
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,000
You get more humble,
you know,

473
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:41,340
I slept less a Jujitsu that I do with 
other things,

474
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,860
but I still suck in comparison to people
that are really good.

475
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:45,053
That's really interesting.
I like that because I started baking 

476
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:54,060
very domestic a and I suck at it.
Fucking terrible ad you have to think,

477
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:56,740
but I have to think and I'm learning and
I.

478
00:19:56,741 --> 00:19:59,250
and it's for the thrill and the joy of 
doing it.

479
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:01,530
It's not,
it's not result oriented.

480
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:04,500
And I think that's the difference 
between hobbies and career,

481
00:20:04,501 --> 00:20:06,200
right?
There's no who gives a shit.

482
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:09,210
There's no results that need to happen 
with you and bow hunting.

483
00:20:09,211 --> 00:20:10,140
If they happen,
great,

484
00:20:10,141 --> 00:20:11,070
if not,
whatever,

485
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:15,300
but it's for the enjoyment of the 
activity versus like results,

486
00:20:15,301 --> 00:20:15,781
you know like,
well,

487
00:20:15,781 --> 00:20:16,614
why should I play the piano?
I'm not going to get to Carnegie Hall 

488
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:22,080
with it says you have to get to Carnegie
Hall.

489
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:22,933
Just enjoy the activity or hobby well in
Indiana and being obsessed with the 

490
00:20:27,961 --> 00:20:30,780
process of learning because you're a 
beginner.

491
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:31,913
Whereas opposed to like if you're some 
mega celebrity superstar comedian that 

492
00:20:35,161 --> 00:20:37,200
sells out giant arenas,
you're not.

493
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:39,110
You're not a beginner man.
I mean you're.

494
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:40,163
And if that's all you do,
if all you do is something you're 

495
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:45,030
awesome at and everybody loves you and 
you go out,

496
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:47,290
what's up everybody?
Or you know,

497
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:48,080
like

498
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:48,913
there's a weird disconnect that happens 
with people and you see it with certain 

499
00:20:51,761 --> 00:20:52,594
comics.
I mean you see a clear progression in 

500
00:20:55,510 --> 00:21:00,510
their stardom and their act falling 
apart and that is because of the loss of

501
00:21:01,571 --> 00:21:05,320
touch with reality and what's normal in 
the world.

502
00:21:05,321 --> 00:21:10,321
And also you get to fucking comfortable 
ride complacency and you start believing

503
00:21:11,831 --> 00:21:16,831
that you're awesome self critical aspect
of analyzing your act,

504
00:21:17,381 --> 00:21:21,280
going over with a fine tooth comb.
Like when you just did this special,

505
00:21:21,281 --> 00:21:22,114
right?
I'm sure you must have spent a lot of 

506
00:21:23,081 --> 00:21:25,990
time combing every,
every,

507
00:21:25,991 --> 00:21:28,400
every word mattered,
every sentence mattered,

508
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:30,190
every joke manner.
That's why you're really good.

509
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:31,360
And that's,
that's the whole thing.

510
00:21:31,361 --> 00:21:33,990
Like you have to fucking hate yourself 
so much.

511
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:41,480
I'm so glad you said that because.
Because I,

512
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:42,160
I,
I,

513
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:42,993
you know,
like I said,

514
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:44,500
I,
I've told you before we really,

515
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:45,723
October ninth,
I was just some Douche bag who sold 200 

516
00:21:47,951 --> 00:21:49,900
tickets in Portland and I'm still that 
person.

517
00:21:49,901 --> 00:21:50,680
But I'm saying like,
uh,

518
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:51,820
October 10th,
100,

519
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:54,120
8 million people now have access to my 
staff.

520
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:55,773
It's a bit of a mind fuck.
But the good news is I'm still 

521
00:21:57,431 --> 00:22:01,020
self-loathing enough to be like,
you gotta grind like you still,

522
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:02,400
I'm still gonna.
Go to the comedy store.

523
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:05,680
Sure work out this next hour.
And it's always the work of it.

524
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:06,933
But you do have to fucking hate.
You can't believe the hype that you're 

525
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:10,040
great.
No,

526
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:11,243
you know,
you know all the various incarnations 

527
00:22:14,591 --> 00:22:16,390
your act has gone through in each bit 
has gone through.

528
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:17,740
When someone comes to see you,
they're like,

529
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,750
we're going to go secret with Mommy's.

530
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,313
See you.
And it's the first time hearing all the 

531
00:22:22,091 --> 00:22:23,920
material and they love and like,
oh my God,

532
00:22:23,921 --> 00:22:27,160
it was fucking amazing.
You know better because you know,

533
00:22:27,161 --> 00:22:29,790
you've gone through it all and you 
picked it apart and you know,

534
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:33,460
I always tell people like I'm done.
I'm not like the biggest fan of me.

535
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:34,563
Like I don't do better no matter how 
much I murder of your comedy and you're 

536
00:22:42,251 --> 00:22:44,860
like one of the most thoughtful thought 
provoking,

537
00:22:44,861 --> 00:22:46,450
funny,
articulate,

538
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:47,930
like out.
You know what I mean?

539
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,780
You're here really deep and good.
I've know myself too well,

540
00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:56,920
Alec,
I don't believe.

541
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:57,521
Yeah,
you can't.

542
00:22:57,521 --> 00:22:58,354
You can't.
That's what I'm talking to tom about 

543
00:22:59,291 --> 00:23:02,520
this so far this morning too.
Or we're walking and I was like that.

544
00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:03,363
I think that's how you,
you keep your career is if you struggle 

545
00:23:06,731 --> 00:23:07,960
is though it was the first.

546
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,461
You know what I mean?
Like you,

547
00:23:09,461 --> 00:23:10,294
you don't think you're all that,
do stuff that you're sucking that to do 

548
00:23:13,271 --> 00:23:15,180
the baking,
do the hot yoga,

549
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:16,420
do pilates,
pauses.

550
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:19,060
Very underrated.
Fucking it kicks my ass.

551
00:23:19,061 --> 00:23:20,920
I hate it.
I like to exercise,

552
00:23:20,921 --> 00:23:21,754
but after I had my kid I was like,
I don't want to be brittle and hunched 

553
00:23:24,671 --> 00:23:25,504
over and in Shitty at 50 like I'm 
looking to 50 and plot is like a core 

554
00:23:29,651 --> 00:23:30,960
thing.
Gosh,

555
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:33,970
your whole core and that's the thing 
that people don't think about.

556
00:23:33,971 --> 00:23:35,890
It's like a hip word.
Use like core.

557
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:37,740
What does that,
what does that.

558
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:40,510
I didn't know what that was.
What it really means,

559
00:23:40,511 --> 00:23:43,060
which you really got to work,
is not just your muscles,

560
00:23:43,061 --> 00:23:46,010
like your thighs or your arms work,
the

561
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:46,843
stuff that keeps you upright.
All those muscles that stabilize your 

562
00:23:49,941 --> 00:23:51,980
back,
all those muscles that allow you to have

563
00:23:51,981 --> 00:23:52,814
good posture.
All those muscles that keep your discs 

564
00:23:54,771 --> 00:23:56,060
from compressing.
Yeah,

565
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:56,903
like all.
And that's one of the things that yoga 

566
00:23:57,561 --> 00:23:58,910
does.
It stretches you out and

567
00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:01,520
get back into yoga.
I go,

568
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,450
Tommy.
Yeah.

569
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:06,400
I'm going to go.
Because when I had a kid at a fucked up,

570
00:24:06,401 --> 00:24:10,570
I got Sciatica because he know your,
your body literally splits in half.

571
00:24:10,571 --> 00:24:12,820
Your pelvis is to two bones,
right?

572
00:24:12,821 --> 00:24:15,580
That come apart and baby comes out and 
then it has to heal.

573
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:19,900
So I'm two years postpartum and,
and it's just now kind of coming back.

574
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:22,080
But yeah dude,
it's been like,

575
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,110
it's,
it's brutal.

576
00:24:23,111 --> 00:24:27,310
I'm sure being 39 or 41 I had a baby 
probably wasn't helpful,

577
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:31,000
but that plays,
it kicks my and I'm bad at it too.

578
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:34,600
I suck at polities and I make fun of 
myself the whole time.

579
00:24:34,601 --> 00:24:35,434
I'm like,
I don't have perfect form for the best 

580
00:24:36,941 --> 00:24:39,880
at this you've ever seen,
but I do still do it.

581
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:44,240
You still fucking push yourself while 
doing things that you suck at I think is

582
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:45,220
his giant

583
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:48,520
for anyone doing anything.
Because I think that if you get,

584
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:52,210
you get to certain levels of proficiency
at things,

585
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:53,783
you can get lost in that thing.
And I think one of the best ways 

586
00:24:56,171 --> 00:24:57,004
especially maybe I don't.
Maybe I'm just looking at in terms of 

587
00:24:58,991 --> 00:24:59,824
creative endeavors,
because like standup obviously is so 

588
00:25:01,991 --> 00:25:06,550
dependent upon your ideas,
so dependent upon creativity that one of

589
00:25:06,551 --> 00:25:07,384
the best ways for me to have other 
thoughts other than like just my 

590
00:25:11,501 --> 00:25:14,440
immediate act and doing shows and 
travel,

591
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:15,750
you know,
like that's the worst thing that happens

592
00:25:15,751 --> 00:25:16,570
to comics,
right.

593
00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:17,403
They started doing an airplane jokes 
because they're on airplanes all the 

594
00:25:18,611 --> 00:25:21,760
time and hotel jokes and they just lose 
their perspective.

595
00:25:21,761 --> 00:25:24,730
Right.
Do other shit like live a life.

596
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:25,633
Yeah.
Live a life and do stuff that's fucking 

597
00:25:26,741 --> 00:25:28,050
hard.
No.

598
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,100
Have some struggles so that the standup 
struggle,

599
00:25:30,101 --> 00:25:33,400
it doesn't seem that standup is the 
easiest fucking part of my day.

600
00:25:33,401 --> 00:25:33,760
All

601
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,170
right.
After,

602
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:36,840
you know,
doing it for 14 years.

603
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:37,773
Yes.
Yoga and running and all this different 

604
00:25:40,831 --> 00:25:43,470
shit I do.
The standup part is the easiest part.

605
00:25:43,770 --> 00:25:44,880
You know,
it's so interesting too.

606
00:25:44,881 --> 00:25:46,470
I was thinking about,
uh,

607
00:25:46,650 --> 00:25:47,610
you know,
I've been,

608
00:25:47,611 --> 00:25:48,444
I've been doing it for 14 years before I
got this first special and I was like 

609
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:55,380
thinking about uh,
the crazy shit you go through to,

610
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:58,890
to be a comic and like the horrible 
positions.

611
00:25:58,891 --> 00:26:02,940
I put myself as a woman too.
It's especially fucked up because you're

612
00:26:02,941 --> 00:26:03,774
like if feature act and you're staying 
in motels where the door faces the 

613
00:26:07,861 --> 00:26:08,694
fucking parking lot and you're doing 
some Hibachi grill and some weirdos 

614
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:16,920
going to try to pay you with a fur coat 
instead of money this week.

615
00:26:16,921 --> 00:26:17,754
You do like who?
Like what kind of sickness was I in in 

616
00:26:20,551 --> 00:26:23,760
my twenties and thirties were I thought 
that was okay.

617
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:24,613
You know,
you really would only do it when you're 

618
00:26:25,681 --> 00:26:28,290
young.
You want to start that right now.

619
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:31,360
It would be such a grind.
Like guys like Dean del Ray,

620
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:32,493
like give it up to that guy.
That guy didn't even start doing stand 

621
00:26:34,841 --> 00:26:35,674
up to you is like,
I think it was like 46 or some crazy 

622
00:26:38,281 --> 00:26:40,430
shit like that.
Deans in his fifties.

623
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:42,540
Yes.
He looks great.

624
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:43,503
Looks Great.

625
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:44,843
He looks great.
He looked like shit just a few years 

626
00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:47,041
ago.
He,

627
00:26:47,041 --> 00:26:49,200
uh,
he got off sugar completely.

628
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:50,190
Oh,
that's right.

629
00:26:50,191 --> 00:26:53,070
He was eating candy all day,
had like a real sugar problem,

630
00:26:53,071 --> 00:26:54,420
and he went to the doctor and the doctor
said,

631
00:26:54,421 --> 00:26:56,670
hey bro,
you're going to get fucking diabetes.

632
00:26:56,671 --> 00:26:59,250
You are right now prediabetic.
He's like,

633
00:26:59,251 --> 00:27:00,630
see this?
Look at your blood.

634
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:01,673
You see the show them the blood markers 
while you're on the way like you are 

635
00:27:03,901 --> 00:27:05,610
right now.
Officially prediabetic.

636
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:07,110
What do you do?
And these are,

637
00:27:07,111 --> 00:27:12,111
well,
he gummy bears and Shit and gummy bears,

638
00:27:14,101 --> 00:27:17,490
man.
He would eat candy all day long.

639
00:27:17,491 --> 00:27:19,770
It's crazy.
It's so bad for you.

640
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:23,070
Sugar is the worst for you.
That's the fucking devil is the devil.

641
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:27,750
But they say your body doesn't really 
differentiate between fruit and candy.

642
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:28,820
I,
I had to.

643
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:31,350
I had a trainer that called it nature's 
candy.

644
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:35,410
Fruit Nature's candy crunch.

645
00:27:37,010 --> 00:27:40,350
Guy Goes,
he used to live with cowboy boots on.

646
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:42,150
Don't beat.
And that name was candy.

647
00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:46,050
Have yourself a wheat biscuit.
He went,

648
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:47,310
he was a minor.
Yeah.

649
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:51,630
Yeah.
He was telling me about nature's candy,

650
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:52,800
the evil of it.
And I was like,

651
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:54,210
that's true.
It's just fucking sugar.

652
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,540
Yeah.
But so good.

653
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:57,770
Let's go the other day.
Oh,

654
00:27:57,780 --> 00:28:00,120
so delicious and nice.
Ripe Mango.

655
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:02,610
They do.
That makes me shit.

656
00:28:03,010 --> 00:28:03,843
That's like lightening.
You know what makes me shit my fucking 

657
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:10,580
coffee.
Caveman coffee stuff opens up sometimes.

658
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:13,673
Sometimes I shit like the other day I 
shit and I tell them my seven year old 

659
00:28:16,021 --> 00:28:17,970
about it.
Tell her she's like,

660
00:28:17,971 --> 00:28:19,350
Daddy,
you almost done it.

661
00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:20,223
Goes playing with her.
And I had to take this horrible shit 

662
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:25,770
just taking her to a martial arts class 
and we got home and I go,

663
00:28:25,771 --> 00:28:27,330
I'll play with you.
But first I got to go potty.

664
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:29,540
And I was in that five minutes.
She's like,

665
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:30,600
Daddy,
you almost done.

666
00:28:30,601 --> 00:28:31,434
I'm like,
look,

667
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:34,290
this shit I took was so huge.
I was almost going to show it to you.

668
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:36,420
As I say the poop.
I don't say shit.

669
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:39,540
Don't know why I'm preparing a curse in 
front of it.

670
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,040
I do occasionally,
but here's,

671
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:42,660
here's the problem.
When when she was three,

672
00:28:42,661 --> 00:28:44,220
when my youngest was three,
we were skiing.

673
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:47,940
She's been skiing since you like to.
And we took her skin and uh,

674
00:28:47,941 --> 00:28:51,300
we're putting all our stuff back in and 
we had everything stacked up,

675
00:28:51,301 --> 00:28:54,060
but we're putting the bags away,
we're getting ready to leave.

676
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:57,810
And my wife goes,
you honey,

677
00:28:57,811 --> 00:28:59,880
you didn't put your,
your helmet back in,

678
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,570
in the bag.
She looks to helmet,

679
00:29:01,571 --> 00:29:02,404
she likes the bag.
She goes,

680
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:08,270
shit fucked three girls three looking at
her bag.

681
00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:12,720
Oh my gosh.
It's great.

682
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:14,180
And my wife,
just girls,

683
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:17,340
we were trying not to laugh to encourage
her,

684
00:29:17,341 --> 00:29:20,820
but it was fucking hilarious because it 
was a natural.

685
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:21,630
Like,
she's like,

686
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:24,690
that's where you're supposed to say,
daddy says shit.

687
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:27,853
Well that's the problem is that our son 
has two comics for parents throwing a 

688
00:29:33,661 --> 00:29:34,494
tantrum.
And then he pushed his time and he hits 

689
00:29:35,791 --> 00:29:36,840
him and were just like,

690
00:29:44,970 --> 00:29:45,803
hey buddy.
Now to almost two slash 22 months and 

691
00:29:49,151 --> 00:29:50,800
we're starting that potty training 
stuff.

692
00:29:50,801 --> 00:29:52,900
So we got to come up with a word,
like you say,

693
00:29:52,910 --> 00:29:56,860
poor or so were we started using dump 
because we want to be like,

694
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:59,680
oh,
that'd be really funny.

695
00:29:59,681 --> 00:30:01,420
When he's in school and he's like,
I have to take a dump.

696
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,940
It's not dirty,
it's just funny.

697
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:07,930
So we started with dump,
but he can't say it,

698
00:30:07,931 --> 00:30:12,931
so it's turned to poo poo poo poo poo 
poo trip.

699
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:17,440
And I want to give you a kid,
a word for shit that they can't say no.

700
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:19,780
That's right.
So it's got to be fun stuff,

701
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:30,220
Mama Dada.
Very simple.

702
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,113
Now did your.
My son insists on sitting on my lap 

703
00:30:33,401 --> 00:30:37,570
while I take a shit.
Sometimes the difference between the way

704
00:30:37,810 --> 00:30:40,780
kids treat the girl,
the Mommy and Daddy,

705
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:43,650
mommy,
they cling to me.

706
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:45,880
Did you breastfeed or did you pump or 
did?

707
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:46,391
Yeah,
I did.

708
00:30:46,391 --> 00:30:48,280
For both.
Pump thing to both.

709
00:30:48,281 --> 00:30:49,980
Man did it all.
Formula breast.

710
00:30:50,170 --> 00:30:53,440
So just connected to you.
Just like physically,

711
00:30:53,441 --> 00:30:56,470
you are the source of nutrients.
You're the source of love.

712
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:59,380
You're the source of life.
There's so much going on.

713
00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:01,180
So crazy.
What does it feel?

714
00:31:01,290 --> 00:31:02,670
Powerful?
Yeah,

715
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:03,593
it's the best.
It really as far as being a woman in 

716
00:31:05,891 --> 00:31:07,270
society,
like Societaly,

717
00:31:07,271 --> 00:31:08,104
it's not that great,
but I will say that like reproduction 

718
00:31:10,691 --> 00:31:12,130
stuff.
It's fucking awesome.

719
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,930
How is it not great?
Societaly?

720
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:15,341
I mean,
you know,

721
00:31:15,341 --> 00:31:17,770
we're still second class citizens.
Let's be honest,

722
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:20,070
women are,
you know,

723
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,790
your power is,
there's not,

724
00:31:21,850 --> 00:31:23,290
I don't really feel,
uh,

725
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,820
it's not really,
you know,

726
00:31:24,821 --> 00:31:25,391
blah,
blah blah.

727
00:31:25,391 --> 00:31:26,224
It's not really,
but you don't exist in a corporate 

728
00:31:27,911 --> 00:31:28,744
world.
So.

729
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:32,550
But where do you find the deficit in 
standup?

730
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:34,640
Definitely.
Yeah.

731
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:36,670
I mean,
I think it's starting to come around,

732
00:31:36,671 --> 00:31:39,310
but if you'll look at like where we're 
at now,

733
00:31:39,490 --> 00:31:40,323
it feels a little regressive in terms of
where we were in the nineties with 

734
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:44,900
female cow I would say.

735
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:47,200
Yeah.
What do you think the source of that is?

736
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:47,700
Uh,
that's.

737
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:49,060
I,
I cannot.

738
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,500
I don't know.
I don't know.

739
00:31:50,590 --> 00:31:54,820
I think nine slash 11 changed us,
made us more conservative in some ways.

740
00:31:54,821 --> 00:31:57,520
A little more insulated.
I don't know.

741
00:31:57,610 --> 00:31:58,443
I think it's just a lack of quality.
I think when someone like you comes 

742
00:32:01,151 --> 00:32:05,170
along for real.
I've told you this before.

743
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:06,383
I mean I saw you at the comedy store 
like four or five years ago when I ran 

744
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:11,240
up to like one set that you had.
I'm like,

745
00:32:11,241 --> 00:32:12,790
Oh dude,
you're one of the funniest people alive.

746
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:14,770
I can't take off.
Thank you.

747
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:18,250
You're very encouraging of me and I 
always am so thankful.

748
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:19,293
You're the reason I got a special.
I was in here at years ago and you're 

749
00:32:21,370 --> 00:32:22,660
like,
you should have an hour.

750
00:32:22,661 --> 00:32:23,640
And I was like,
Ooh,

751
00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:27,520
maybe I should get a manager and an 
agent.

752
00:32:27,730 --> 00:32:31,640
Like I wasn't even thinking in terms of 
paying like intelligent.

753
00:32:31,670 --> 00:32:33,970
What were you thinking?
I was fucking just like,

754
00:32:33,971 --> 00:32:35,980
I just want to be good at the.
I just want to be good,

755
00:32:35,981 --> 00:32:37,960
but that's the right attitude.
Yeah.

756
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:39,030
Agronomically.
Yeah.

757
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,033
The people that are like,

758
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:42,800
I need a special now those people suck.
Right?

759
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:46,400
Like the people that are trying to do 
something that's way out of their reach.

760
00:32:46,401 --> 00:32:47,570
Like the people that are like,
you know,

761
00:32:47,571 --> 00:32:49,220
I need to be filling arenas.
Like,

762
00:32:49,221 --> 00:32:50,960
no,
you need to fucking good 10 minutes.

763
00:32:50,961 --> 00:32:53,930
A piece of shit.
Like really talking about like those are

764
00:32:53,931 --> 00:32:55,040
the crazy people,
right?

765
00:32:55,041 --> 00:32:57,740
The people that are like really good at 
promotion but really bad at standup.

766
00:32:58,070 --> 00:32:58,903
But then however,
there's people who are really talented 

767
00:33:01,650 --> 00:33:02,483
but don't have enough business savvy.
So I think there needs to be some kind 

768
00:33:04,971 --> 00:33:05,804
of like thing where you start to learn 
the business and you become responsible 

769
00:33:08,601 --> 00:33:09,434
for that end of it.
And I think I was not taking 

770
00:33:10,911 --> 00:33:11,744
responsibility.
Well I think the thing about standup is 

771
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:15,703
that there is a very,
especially today and there's a 

772
00:33:17,811 --> 00:33:22,040
difference between today and 10 years 
ago or 20 years ago because there's more

773
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:22,874
opportunity and because there's more 
opportunity because of there's youtube 

774
00:33:25,971 --> 00:33:26,804
and there's social media,
there's people that have become very 

775
00:33:28,761 --> 00:33:32,240
famous just through twitter and 
instagram and social media.

776
00:33:32,450 --> 00:33:36,890
So all this new opportunity has opened 
up more possibilities so people are less

777
00:33:36,891 --> 00:33:40,430
stingy and there's more of a sense of 
community for whatever reason.

778
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:43,850
Particularly in La.
La has a very good sense of community.

779
00:33:43,851 --> 00:33:47,630
So even if you're not like the most 
business savvy,

780
00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:48,523
you can be around a lot of people like 
myself or like other people that are 

781
00:33:51,021 --> 00:33:54,920
encouraging and then help and tell 
everybody about their friends.

782
00:33:54,921 --> 00:33:56,810
And like it's one of the cool things 
about comedy.

783
00:33:56,811 --> 00:34:00,070
Like you'll go to like Tom's page if 
someone else is doing something and it'd

784
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:00,830
be like,
Hey,

785
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:01,663
check out,
you know,

786
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:03,290
full trod.
He's fucking hilarious,

787
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:04,520
you know.
Check out Ian Edwards.

788
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:05,730
By the way.
Ian Edwards is punk.

789
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:08,570
He's at the laughing skull in Atlanta 
this weekend.

790
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:13,790
One of the best I've been trying to fit.
He's too fucking laid back.

791
00:34:13,970 --> 00:34:14,803
He's,
he's,

792
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:17,120
Oh yeah.
I mean when he talks,

793
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:18,321
you're like,
what you like,

794
00:34:18,321 --> 00:34:19,070
come on,
come on,

795
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:19,903
come on,
pick it up.

796
00:34:19,970 --> 00:34:21,820
Come on.
He's like the opposite of me.

797
00:34:21,821 --> 00:34:23,870
He's Vegan.
He falls asleep constantly.

798
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:27,590
That motherfucker will sit down and in 
five minutes he's out cold.

799
00:34:27,770 --> 00:34:28,603
Oh No.
I took pictures of him on a plane the 

800
00:34:29,631 --> 00:34:32,150
other day because we were flying to 
Vegas.

801
00:34:32,151 --> 00:34:36,230
It's a 40 minute flight.
He's out cold protein dude.

802
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:39,290
It's a lack of vitamins for sure because
he doesn't eat well.

803
00:34:39,350 --> 00:34:42,230
It's not his.
He does eat vegan.

804
00:34:42,231 --> 00:34:43,070
Look at um,
alcohol.

805
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:48,590
Um,
but he,

806
00:34:48,770 --> 00:34:50,990
he definitely doesn't.
He doesn't take any supplements.

807
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:52,063
He doesn't like make sure that he has a 
complete balanced amino acid profile to 

808
00:34:55,390 --> 00:34:56,223
is foods.
And like I was telling to you that 

809
00:34:57,891 --> 00:34:59,730
either though,
but that's a lot of work.

810
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:01,053
It is of work,
but that's what to do if you want to be 

811
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:06,440
fucking jacked.
He said he would eat elk.

812
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,690
Good.
He said he would eat it because I killed

813
00:35:08,691 --> 00:35:09,360
it,
you know,

814
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,193
and he knows where it came from and it's
not factory farmed and he doesn't have 

815
00:35:12,921 --> 00:35:15,770
to participate in the whole factory farm
system.

816
00:35:15,771 --> 00:35:17,590
So I'm going to cook them some meat 
trial.

817
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:21,740
I'm going to turn him or we get old.
Are you going to put it on instagram?

818
00:35:21,741 --> 00:35:22,660
I would love to see it.
Yeah.

819
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:24,020
I am a film.
That shit.

820
00:35:24,050 --> 00:35:26,270
I'm going to have Jamie set up a camera 
and a tripod.

821
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:33,250
The new studio has a grill of course.
Has a course that as it grows,

822
00:35:33,531 --> 00:35:37,010
big iron yoder pellet grills.
It's fucking amazing.

823
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,190
You say you're moving

824
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:40,900
on my next week,
next week.

825
00:35:40,901 --> 00:35:42,190
Doot Doo doot doot,
doot,

826
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,020
doot,
doot.

827
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:47,180
Enormous.
It's daddy's playhouse.

828
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,270
It's going to be a good time.
I can't wait.

829
00:35:51,271 --> 00:35:52,360
I'm very excited.
Super Cool.

830
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:53,393
But uh,
so we're going to turn it in when it 

831
00:35:54,421 --> 00:35:55,151
gets over there.
Okay,

832
00:35:55,151 --> 00:35:55,830
yeah,
yeah.

833
00:35:55,830 --> 00:35:56,960
What?
Why is he he?

834
00:35:57,390 --> 00:35:58,030
Is it,
is it a,

835
00:35:58,030 --> 00:36:00,210
is it a moral thing?
Is it moral thing?

836
00:36:00,270 --> 00:36:02,040
It's a health thing.
It's a bunch of.

837
00:36:02,041 --> 00:36:02,874
He was eating very poorly.
He was eating junk food and just 

838
00:36:05,461 --> 00:36:07,880
bullshit food,
pizza and burgers and stuff.

839
00:36:07,930 --> 00:36:08,763
He felt like shit and made a decision 
for his health and then along the way 

840
00:36:13,711 --> 00:36:17,530
started examining the moral consequences
of factory farming and he.

841
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:20,340
He's just a really smart guy,
smart guy.

842
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:24,330
Super Smart and just again Atlanta 
laughing's call this weekend.

843
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:27,210
He's one of the funniest guys alive.
I just worked with them.

844
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:29,150
Sell Mellow too.
Melos.

845
00:36:29,610 --> 00:36:33,480
I've known Ian for I want to say like 25
years.

846
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:35,970
Yeah,
we've been friends.

847
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:41,340
We've been friends since I'm shit.
The early nineties.

848
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,860
What?
Where,

849
00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:45,990
when,
how has he been here that long?

850
00:36:46,530 --> 00:36:47,363
He has been what Ian did.
His Ian is a really good writer and one 

851
00:36:51,361 --> 00:36:52,670
of the things that happened along the 
way,

852
00:36:52,730 --> 00:36:54,210
he started getting a lot of jobs,
writing,

853
00:36:55,200 --> 00:37:00,200
writing on television shows and that 
happens to guys or they do that.

854
00:37:00,661 --> 00:37:01,494
It happened to Fitzsimmons who's also 
one of the best comics alive and they 

855
00:37:03,931 --> 00:37:04,764
get distracted by other people's work 
and then people don't realize how good 

856
00:37:08,161 --> 00:37:08,994
they are at stand up.
If you get a chance to see Greg 

857
00:37:10,830 --> 00:37:11,663
Fitzsimmons,
he is one of the fucking best comments 

858
00:37:13,051 --> 00:37:16,800
alive and greg and I started out 
literally a week apart from each other.

859
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:19,950
Same Club in Boston.
He's great.

860
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:21,533
He's best.
He's a great human being tail and he's 

861
00:37:23,371 --> 00:37:24,204
super funny.
He's super funny and super smart and 

862
00:37:26,071 --> 00:37:27,210
just a sweetheart.

863
00:37:27,390 --> 00:37:29,550
He just.
And just ridiculous.

864
00:37:29,551 --> 00:37:30,384
He's so funny.
That's true about writing for other 

865
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,113
people and because I,
I wrote for cartoons for many years and 

866
00:37:35,551 --> 00:37:38,130
I do feel like it sucks your,
your,

867
00:37:38,131 --> 00:37:38,964
your juice out of your voice.
And then I worked on Chelsea for a 

868
00:37:42,541 --> 00:37:44,100
minute and wrote on that show and I was 
like,

869
00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:45,530
I can't,
I can't.

870
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:48,210
Do you feel like you're cheating,
you know,

871
00:37:48,270 --> 00:37:52,080
your own voice and your own ship working
so much on other people's stuff and then

872
00:37:52,081 --> 00:37:54,810
not at all at your own stuff.
And then all of a sudden you're thing is

873
00:37:54,811 --> 00:37:55,644
done and you're behind instead of like 
at the same spot you were when you 

874
00:37:58,501 --> 00:37:59,334
started.
You're behind because you don't even 

875
00:38:00,631 --> 00:38:02,880
know your act anymore.
You got to go over your material.

876
00:38:02,881 --> 00:38:05,640
You're not really working anymore.
It's not in your conscious.

877
00:38:05,730 --> 00:38:07,540
It's not always there.
Was it Louis Ck?

878
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:08,383
I was talking about when he was a writer
on some late was at the tonight show or 

879
00:38:11,161 --> 00:38:11,994
something.
I want to say he was a writer on one of 

880
00:38:14,491 --> 00:38:15,324
the big late night shows and he was,
he got it pretty young too and he was 

881
00:38:18,211 --> 00:38:19,044
like,
this is the best job I could ever hope 

882
00:38:20,761 --> 00:38:21,594
for.
And I think I'm going to hate myself if 

883
00:38:23,461 --> 00:38:26,940
I stay here because you know that I know
I want to be a comic.

884
00:38:26,941 --> 00:38:29,610
I know somewhere that there's something 
out there I need to be doing.

885
00:38:30,090 --> 00:38:32,850
So it's like this gilded cage of,
of being a writer.

886
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:35,010
Yeah.
Well it's also being on a sitcom.

887
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:35,913
Do that.
Being on a Sitcom did that to me for 

888
00:38:37,781 --> 00:38:38,690
sure.
Oh yeah.

889
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:42,310
Like you weren't doing your full 
potential was working all day.

890
00:38:42,610 --> 00:38:43,443
And then,
um,

891
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:46,480
I was still doing sets at night,
but I wasn't writing any new material at

892
00:38:46,481 --> 00:38:46,750
all.

893
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:49,030
I was just doing the same set over and 
over again.

894
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:49,953
And I started this.
I started having some hard sets and one 

895
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:58,940
night the writers came to see me and I 
went up late at the comedy store and ate

896
00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:01,450
a,
a platter of Dick's,

897
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:05,160
just a full,
like a flake,

898
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:08,020
someone getting married or they bring 
over there with the hors d'oeuvres,

899
00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:09,503
eat every trade.
And I just realized like I've become a 

900
00:39:13,271 --> 00:39:14,104
bad comic.
Like I used to be good when I was young 

901
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:18,610
and then I got this show and then over 
the course of the four years,

902
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:21,700
five years that I was on the show,
I just might act deteriorated.

903
00:39:21,701 --> 00:39:22,534
And I realized like I got to get back on
the horse and that because of that one 

904
00:39:25,601 --> 00:39:29,230
bombing set,
I'm like a year and a half later,

905
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:30,790
something like that.
Uh,

906
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:33,060
I got my first album that I did on 
warner brothers.

907
00:39:33,110 --> 00:39:35,980
I allow,
that was like 10 years into comedy.

908
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:41,100
So the whole thing was like a velvet 
cage,

909
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:42,190
you know,
like it's like,

910
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:43,120
oh,
this is it.

911
00:39:43,121 --> 00:39:44,770
I've made,
everything's going to be beautiful now,

912
00:39:44,771 --> 00:39:46,840
but it's not because you're not doing 
your thing.

913
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,660
And it's funny.
Someone asked me like,

914
00:39:49,661 --> 00:39:52,060
well what do you want to do Christina?
What do you want to do?

915
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:53,730
And I was like,
I'm kind of fucking deal in it.

916
00:39:53,870 --> 00:39:57,360
Like the podcasting world is amazing.
Standups.

917
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:59,240
Great.
Like I'm,

918
00:39:59,410 --> 00:40:02,020
I'm doing what could you imagine the 
show that gives you that kind of freedom

919
00:40:02,021 --> 00:40:02,854
that your podcast get has never.
Do you have any fucking dumb meetings 

920
00:40:05,321 --> 00:40:07,090
we'd have to have with the higher aps 
about you go,

921
00:40:07,091 --> 00:40:09,490
you can't see genes.
You can talk about mummies kit.

922
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:10,593
Look,
we've got a survey and people don't 

923
00:40:12,191 --> 00:40:15,190
understand what genes is.
You call answer the jeans.

924
00:40:15,191 --> 00:40:19,180
Like I don't mind if you do it once,
just don't just don't do it.

925
00:40:19,181 --> 00:40:22,430
Every show and the moose soup lady.
What's that about that thing.

926
00:40:22,431 --> 00:40:23,264
And I don't want to fuck it.
I don't like answering to people for 

927
00:40:25,001 --> 00:40:25,834
stuff.
I didn't like the notes that she had 

928
00:40:29,830 --> 00:40:34,410
some Douchey unfunny producer that was 
telling you guys how to do your show and

929
00:40:34,411 --> 00:40:37,600
that's what.
That's what it can be all the time.

930
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:41,980
How many times you can say one thing or 
it has the worst.

931
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:46,930
When you were an actor,
when you act on that show,

932
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,910
would you get lines that you were just 
like,

933
00:40:49,110 --> 00:40:51,370
I can't.
How do I know?

934
00:40:51,650 --> 00:40:52,930
No,
not on news radio.

935
00:40:53,130 --> 00:40:57,370
[inaudible] news radio was so good and 
the writers were so good and the guy who

936
00:40:57,371 --> 00:40:58,690
ran it,
Paul Simms,

937
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,160
the,
the executive producer,

938
00:41:00,430 --> 00:41:01,263
the creator of the show,
he was a genius and one of the things 

939
00:41:02,801 --> 00:41:04,540
that was brilliant about him,
he was,

940
00:41:04,541 --> 00:41:05,870
he still alive,
still a genius.

941
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:10,290
One of the things is brilliant about him
and he let everybody add the leg.

942
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:11,133
Dave Foley was like,
almost like the secret producer of that 

943
00:41:13,031 --> 00:41:16,820
show was amazing.
But because he was on news radio,

944
00:41:16,821 --> 00:41:18,400
um,
right after kids in the hall,

945
00:41:18,401 --> 00:41:21,130
like you did kids in the hall where he's
one of the primary writers,

946
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:23,050
he's a really good writer.
So he would,

947
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,370
he would see like,
you know,

948
00:41:24,730 --> 00:41:25,563
the thing is if you ever been on a 
sitcom before we ever worked on a 

949
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:28,990
Sitcom,
no.

950
00:41:29,590 --> 00:41:31,420
One of the things you do,
you do a run through.

951
00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:33,380
So you do a table read.
When you go down,

952
00:41:33,890 --> 00:41:36,230
everybody sits down,
go over the lines,

953
00:41:36,530 --> 00:41:37,880
you find out what's funny,
everybody laughs,

954
00:41:38,090 --> 00:41:38,923
uh,
the writers will go back to the writing 

955
00:41:39,621 --> 00:41:40,454
room,
they tweak stuff a little bit and then 

956
00:41:41,421 --> 00:41:42,254
you go to the floor and you run it.
And so will you do in a run through as 

957
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:46,370
you'll start off.
Okay,

958
00:41:46,371 --> 00:41:48,560
we're seeing the hair and the break 
room,

959
00:41:48,561 --> 00:41:50,540
blah blah blah.
And you know,

960
00:41:50,541 --> 00:41:52,730
maybe it just doesn't work.
Maybe it seems like it work,

961
00:41:52,731 --> 00:41:55,100
but it doesn't work.
And Dave would be the guy that goes,

962
00:41:55,210 --> 00:41:57,020
I'm andy,
why don't,

963
00:41:57,530 --> 00:41:59,480
why don't we try this?
Like Vicky,

964
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:00,373
why don't you walk in here and Andy,
you walk in at the same time and you 

965
00:42:03,591 --> 00:42:05,210
guys both say the same thing at the same
time.

966
00:42:05,210 --> 00:42:06,043
And then,
you know,

967
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:06,973
he'll like come up with like a whole new
scenario to get this point across to 

968
00:42:10,041 --> 00:42:10,874
move us into the next scene.
And he would do that in front of the 

969
00:42:12,681 --> 00:42:14,360
producers and they would go,
love it.

970
00:42:14,361 --> 00:42:15,040
Perfect,
let's,

971
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:15,873
let's go with that.
And so they would rewrite the scene and 

972
00:42:17,211 --> 00:42:18,860
put Dave's lines and,
and I swear to God,

973
00:42:18,861 --> 00:42:20,780
that might've happened 40 percent of the
time.

974
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:23,000
Wow.
So if you see that show,

975
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:27,890
like maybe 40 percent of the scenes at 
least were tweaked by Dave Foley.

976
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,900
That's bananas.
And did he get the punch up?

977
00:42:29,901 --> 00:42:34,901
Credit Punch up credit.
But that was the thing is like everybody

978
00:42:35,361 --> 00:42:37,610
was just working to do.
But oddly enough,

979
00:42:37,611 --> 00:42:41,080
Phil Hartman did zero of that.
Phil Hartman was just like,

980
00:42:41,090 --> 00:42:41,923
stick to the script and kill it.
But his character was such a beautiful 

981
00:42:45,441 --> 00:42:47,580
character to write for this,
uh,

982
00:42:47,810 --> 00:42:52,580
sort of have tos ridiculous guy who was 
just like,

983
00:42:52,790 --> 00:42:54,890
just completely,
you know,

984
00:42:55,010 --> 00:42:57,860
just didn't get it and was like full of 
himself.

985
00:42:57,860 --> 00:42:58,693
And he was so good at playing that 
character that they would just nail his 

986
00:43:01,041 --> 00:43:01,874
character.
I then he would just go out and smash 

987
00:43:02,901 --> 00:43:04,190
it.
That's crazy.

988
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:06,650
That was a little too young when that 
show came out.

989
00:43:06,651 --> 00:43:08,930
I didn't get to see it.
But Phil Hartman,

990
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:10,160
Holy Shit,
right?

991
00:43:10,610 --> 00:43:12,110
Yeah.
Holy Shit.

992
00:43:12,430 --> 00:43:13,770
You know,
like crazy.

993
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:16,070
I was uh,
I like,

994
00:43:16,071 --> 00:43:19,850
I like Rodney Dangerfield and uh,
did you ever hear that back to school?

995
00:43:19,851 --> 00:43:20,684
When he got that script it was kind of a
Turd and the story goes that he took it 

996
00:43:25,251 --> 00:43:26,084
and he rewrote,
like he wrote jokes and all the margins 

997
00:43:29,090 --> 00:43:31,790
and then go and send it back to the 
studio and they were like,

998
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:33,500
this is hilarious.
Can we make this movie?

999
00:43:33,501 --> 00:43:34,130
He's like,
yeah,

1000
00:43:34,130 --> 00:43:35,920
you could pay me whatever,
$10,000

1001
00:43:35,930 --> 00:43:37,680
a joke and I'll look and do it that way.
Like,

1002
00:43:38,030 --> 00:43:38,980
that's awesome.
Do you like,

1003
00:43:39,070 --> 00:43:41,660
that's how fucking Dave Foley should 
have been.

1004
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:46,490
Like with Kevin Hart does with movies 
where I'm like,

1005
00:43:46,491 --> 00:43:49,160
he has a,
a negotiation for the movie,

1006
00:43:49,161 --> 00:43:49,731
right?
They say,

1007
00:43:49,731 --> 00:43:50,564
oh,
we'll give you x amount of million 

1008
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:53,660
dollars to the movie.
And they go,

1009
00:43:53,661 --> 00:43:55,910
but we want you to promote it on your 
social media.

1010
00:43:55,940 --> 00:43:57,520
Once you put on your twitter and your 
answer is like,

1011
00:43:57,530 --> 00:43:57,951
Whoa,
Whoa,

1012
00:43:57,951 --> 00:43:58,580
Whoa,
Whoa,

1013
00:43:58,580 --> 00:44:00,440
oh yeah,
that's a different deal.

1014
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:02,810
This is all my thing.
I built that up,

1015
00:44:02,811 --> 00:44:03,650
like,
if you want that,

1016
00:44:03,651 --> 00:44:06,200
you gotta give me my money for that.
That's what's up Kevin Hart.

1017
00:44:06,210 --> 00:44:08,300
And then they'll like what?
Like,

1018
00:44:08,301 --> 00:44:10,430
yeah,
but if the movie does well you.

1019
00:44:10,470 --> 00:44:10,770
No,
no,

1020
00:44:10,770 --> 00:44:11,051
no,
no,

1021
00:44:11,051 --> 00:44:11,400
no,
no.

1022
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:13,580
This was your mother fucking movie.
You're giving me money,

1023
00:44:13,790 --> 00:44:16,160
so if you want me to promote it on my 
instagram,

1024
00:44:16,170 --> 00:44:18,110
my social media,
like that's a business.

1025
00:44:18,111 --> 00:44:21,250
He's built up a promotional business.
No,

1026
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:22,880
that guy's a genius when it comes to 
that.

1027
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:24,470
Fantastic.
Absolutely.

1028
00:44:24,820 --> 00:44:26,150
Yeah.
Fantastic.

1029
00:44:26,151 --> 00:44:27,380
Why not?
Why not?

1030
00:44:27,650 --> 00:44:29,930
You should be compensated for that.
This you're following.

1031
00:44:29,931 --> 00:44:31,920
Especially him.
That's his whole deal.

1032
00:44:32,230 --> 00:44:36,180
So I mean most of what he became,
he became because it was comedy central,

1033
00:44:36,181 --> 00:44:39,690
special and then relentless social media
stuff.

1034
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:41,010
Like really?
Yeah,

1035
00:44:41,130 --> 00:44:43,410
massive data and obviously he's really 
funny.

1036
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:45,660
Super Funny.
If you don't have talent,

1037
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:46,613
he's one of the rare guys that has 
talent and he's really good at 

1038
00:44:48,451 --> 00:44:49,740
promotion.
Whereas most,

1039
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:51,330
you know,
most of the people that are like really,

1040
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:52,193
like there's a lot of people that are 
good at promotion but they're not 

1041
00:44:53,670 --> 00:44:54,760
talented.
Right.

1042
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:58,280
You need to have some kind of meat for 
the bone now.

1043
00:44:58,290 --> 00:45:00,540
Who is great at that though?
I mean the old gangster,

1044
00:45:00,541 --> 00:45:01,560
I've.
It was Dane Cook.

1045
00:45:01,561 --> 00:45:04,500
If you think back to a.
was it even like friends?

1046
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:07,770
Yeah.
He was the first two.

1047
00:45:08,350 --> 00:45:12,390
He became famous through social media.
The first guy ever.

1048
00:45:12,790 --> 00:45:14,190
Yeah.
That's crazy.

1049
00:45:14,191 --> 00:45:15,960
But you have to have that in you,
I guess.

1050
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:18,120
I remember reading a people magazine 
article.

1051
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:19,393
I was at the dentist and it was a people
magazine article that said the Dean had 

1052
00:45:22,450 --> 00:45:25,030
250,000
followers and he's like,

1053
00:45:25,050 --> 00:45:25,950
what?
Why?

1054
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:27,300
I was like,
that's insane.

1055
00:45:27,330 --> 00:45:28,930
It wasn't followers.
It was friends.

1056
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:33,420
So many friends.
I don't even fucking know.

1057
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:38,070
It's weird when you're like,
I do want to note that many people.

1058
00:45:38,130 --> 00:45:41,250
You know what's really crazy is that my 
space just evaporated.

1059
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:43,890
It did.
It got really weird.

1060
00:45:44,510 --> 00:45:47,190
It took a facebook took.
It took its place,

1061
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:50,940
but my space still there,
like Jamie,

1062
00:45:50,941 --> 00:45:54,300
go to my space.
Taylor,

1063
00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:55,693
did Shirin Watch miley cyrus perform on 
Carpool Karaoke on link and people love 

1064
00:46:01,630 --> 00:46:03,840
that car.
Karaoke shell people.

1065
00:46:03,870 --> 00:46:04,950
Not,
not normal people.

1066
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:06,353
No one.
That's healthy.

1067
00:46:09,130 --> 00:46:11,040
Shit sucks.
Why does everything suck?

1068
00:46:11,190 --> 00:46:13,860
It doesn't necessarily all suck.
A lot of.

1069
00:46:13,861 --> 00:46:16,640
It sucks a lot.
I mean I'm on the um,

1070
00:46:16,820 --> 00:46:18,240
the apple TV.
I try to,

1071
00:46:18,241 --> 00:46:19,590
I try to find stuff.
I'm like,

1072
00:46:19,650 --> 00:46:21,900
that's a fucking stupid.
The only thing that is interesting about

1073
00:46:21,901 --> 00:46:24,460
that is that they're actually in a car 
and they're actually driving it.

1074
00:46:24,470 --> 00:46:26,540
Let them drive.
How do they film that?

1075
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:28,650
They filled the Gopros and shit.
Like,

1076
00:46:28,651 --> 00:46:31,290
this is my space,
but this is so strange.

1077
00:46:31,291 --> 00:46:33,030
It's like,
who's on this motherfucker?

1078
00:46:33,870 --> 00:46:35,700
Who's going now?
It's like a news site.

1079
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:38,280
Who are the people?
See if I'm on it.

1080
00:46:38,281 --> 00:46:39,114
Still.
Liz,

1081
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:42,680
she's a musician.
Tried to.

1082
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:43,613
I tried to delete my page long time ago 
and they wouldn't let me get these 

1083
00:46:50,250 --> 00:46:52,790
comedians.
I know all of them there.

1084
00:46:52,791 --> 00:46:57,440
These guys are top little fuck.
Are these people look like?

1085
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:00,180
Come on,
look at that guy with the hair.

1086
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:01,313
No,
I went to see him be super upset if we 

1087
00:47:03,541 --> 00:47:06,870
didn't share funny comedy pictures ever.
In the beginning of your career,

1088
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:09,630
the wackiest I took the stupidest 
picture ever.

1089
00:47:09,990 --> 00:47:13,890
I had a fake mugshot picture with the 
lipstick kisses on my face.

1090
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:16,730
I think I tried to like put a bra in my 
head too,

1091
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:18,690
but so dumb.
Oh,

1092
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:19,533
it's so embarrassing.

1093
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:22,650
I had a business card.
Did you ever do that?

1094
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:24,570
I never had a business card.
I don't.

1095
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,790
Don't think I did and I hadn't paid.
It was a picture of me at four years old

1096
00:47:28,930 --> 00:47:31,630
making a funny face.
Those are so cute.

1097
00:47:31,930 --> 00:47:33,670
Yeah.
It's like it's painful.

1098
00:47:33,671 --> 00:47:37,060
It's so embarrassing now.
I now.

1099
00:47:37,390 --> 00:47:38,790
Yeah.
I don't have one.

1100
00:47:39,620 --> 00:47:40,590
Get One.
Yeah.

1101
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:42,740
Yeah.
We signed a picture for Sonya.

1102
00:47:42,780 --> 00:47:44,020
I'm like,
you have a picture for me.

1103
00:47:45,020 --> 00:47:46,270
Took 1:20
years ago.

1104
00:47:46,490 --> 00:47:47,323
Pictures Man,
like ucf pictures at the comedy clubs 

1105
00:47:50,171 --> 00:47:51,850
coming next week and they put up a 
headshot.

1106
00:47:51,870 --> 00:47:52,960
I don't.
I don't even have one.

1107
00:47:52,990 --> 00:47:54,580
What do they put up with?
You have no idea.

1108
00:47:54,910 --> 00:47:56,760
They just find some shit online and they
print it.

1109
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:58,300
We put it up,
but see that's how I feel now.

1110
00:47:58,301 --> 00:47:59,440
Like come on man,
I'm online.

1111
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:01,900
Print that shit out.
It's all there.

1112
00:48:01,940 --> 00:48:05,350
You don't need to have my name at the 
bottom of it and get the fuck out or you

1113
00:48:05,351 --> 00:48:10,351
can write that.
Like if I can sharpen it is the headshot

1114
00:48:10,450 --> 00:48:15,450
thing was always a big deal in Boston 
because in Boston the there was like the

1115
00:48:16,301 --> 00:48:17,134
old guard does these guys that had been 
around forever that will like the top 

1116
00:48:19,721 --> 00:48:22,570
dogs in the local scene.
Those guys were like,

1117
00:48:22,571 --> 00:48:24,640
if you have a headshot you probably 
fucking suck.

1118
00:48:26,020 --> 00:48:28,870
No one ever worked on their headshot.
Yeah,

1119
00:48:28,871 --> 00:48:31,600
like the young guys were all we have 
like these new fancy headshots.

1120
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:33,070
The old guys,
they didn't have anything.

1121
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:33,913
They would just murder Steve Sweeney 
plane at the cow saloon restaurant and 

1122
00:48:36,871 --> 00:48:38,610
just murder.
No headshot.

1123
00:48:38,860 --> 00:48:40,930
Try to find a headshot album.
It's fucking faded.

1124
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:41,793
You gotta pull it out of a window.
Was sitting there from the late 

1125
00:48:45,650 --> 00:48:46,483
eighties,
so whoever had their shit together most 

1126
00:48:48,161 --> 00:48:50,590
as an open miker was definitely the 
unfunny.

1127
00:48:50,590 --> 00:48:51,610
Just like,
well,

1128
00:48:51,611 --> 00:48:52,444
there was a bunch of good.
You remember it probably wasn't around 

1129
00:48:54,311 --> 00:48:55,144
when you were around,
but there was a thing called the comedy 

1130
00:48:56,201 --> 00:48:59,110
USA industry guide.
No,

1131
00:48:59,380 --> 00:49:00,213
when I first started out there was a 
thing called the comedy USA Industry 

1132
00:49:02,891 --> 00:49:07,150
Guide and they would send it out to all 
the industry and I was always like super

1133
00:49:07,151 --> 00:49:07,984
in awe of the guys that had a big page 
and like a lot of it was like college 

1134
00:49:11,981 --> 00:49:14,560
acts,
like a college act back then was.

1135
00:49:14,620 --> 00:49:16,270
That was the pinnacle.
That's what you wanted to be.

1136
00:49:16,271 --> 00:49:17,104
You want to be a college act because if 
you were a college act you could make 

1137
00:49:19,871 --> 00:49:22,570
like a thousand dollars a college or 
$2,000

1138
00:49:22,571 --> 00:49:25,620
a college like Holy Shit and you would 
think about,

1139
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:27,370
oh my God,
I could do two colleges on a weekend and

1140
00:49:27,371 --> 00:49:28,204
make $4,000.
It was insane and I knew guys who were 

1141
00:49:31,301 --> 00:49:31,960
doing it.

1142
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:34,720
I knew guys who would manage clean your 
act up so you can do colleges.

1143
00:49:35,070 --> 00:49:38,740
They will say that that that was the 
best when I started to.

1144
00:49:38,741 --> 00:49:41,530
It was you got to clean it out.
Otherwise,

1145
00:49:41,531 --> 00:49:42,880
you're not going to get on the tonight 
show,

1146
00:49:42,881 --> 00:49:43,714
you're not going to get on the thing,
and then the internet happened and 

1147
00:49:46,691 --> 00:49:48,730
everybody was like,
fuck you,

1148
00:49:48,731 --> 00:49:49,770
and you're clean.
You know,

1149
00:49:49,780 --> 00:49:51,760
there's different outlets now.
You don't need to.

1150
00:49:52,060 --> 00:49:54,550
You know there's cable.
It's not,

1151
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:55,533
it's just not the same.
And you know what's really gross to the 

1152
00:49:59,081 --> 00:50:03,970
mediocre comic that suppresses the 
talented guys that are coming up.

1153
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,310
You ever seen those guys that like tell 
you what to do,

1154
00:50:06,311 --> 00:50:07,960
what not to do?
Oh,

1155
00:50:08,050 --> 00:50:08,883
there was this one guy who was the host 
of like open mic night in Boston at the 

1156
00:50:11,711 --> 00:50:16,180
time and he was aggressively mediocre 
because act was horrible,

1157
00:50:16,390 --> 00:50:17,710
but he was like,
you would,

1158
00:50:17,740 --> 00:50:19,720
you would go on stage and even if you 
killed,

1159
00:50:19,810 --> 00:50:20,643
even if you had a good set,
he would shit on the fact that you had 

1160
00:50:22,871 --> 00:50:26,710
to swear you're broke the fuck meter you
were up there breaking the fuck meter.

1161
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:28,160
Like what?
Like,

1162
00:50:28,161 --> 00:50:30,500
you know,
you can't do that on TV is going to be a

1163
00:50:30,501 --> 00:50:33,620
lot of guys that are on TV and they're 
going to be on TV and you're going to be

1164
00:50:33,621 --> 00:50:37,370
back here doing the same jokes saying 
the fuck word all the time.

1165
00:50:37,371 --> 00:50:39,170
Like what?
And I was like,

1166
00:50:39,171 --> 00:50:40,710
well what about like the comics?
I like,

1167
00:50:40,711 --> 00:50:44,060
like Andrew dice clay or Sam kinison.
I got news for you,

1168
00:50:44,061 --> 00:50:47,480
man.
You're not dice clay to remind you where

1169
00:50:47,481 --> 00:50:49,550
you are on the,
on the totem pole.

1170
00:50:49,551 --> 00:50:50,150
But I was like,
well,

1171
00:50:50,150 --> 00:50:53,360
somebody like this is not,
this is not good advice.

1172
00:50:53,420 --> 00:50:54,253
No,
I remember being told back to with 

1173
00:50:56,901 --> 00:50:58,020
comedy,
I think right now for,

1174
00:50:58,070 --> 00:50:58,903
for female comics,
I feel like right now there's a 

1175
00:51:01,041 --> 00:51:04,310
particular dichotomy between like the 
Madonna whore thing.

1176
00:51:04,580 --> 00:51:06,300
Like either you're,
you know,

1177
00:51:06,350 --> 00:51:10,020
young and hot and you're talking about 
like sexual stuff or like you're me give

1178
00:51:10,050 --> 00:51:10,780
get fucking mom.

1179
00:51:10,780 --> 00:51:12,260
I'm talking about mom stuff.
Uh,

1180
00:51:12,261 --> 00:51:13,220
there's,
it's very,

1181
00:51:13,221 --> 00:51:16,190
it's different.
It's not like you can be just a person.

1182
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:18,150
I don't think so right now,
but,

1183
00:51:18,190 --> 00:51:20,090
but why do you think that?
Because I think you can.

1184
00:51:20,150 --> 00:51:22,430
I think anybody can be a person if you 
just own it,

1185
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:23,740
you can.
It's an.

1186
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:25,070
I don't know if.
I don't know.

1187
00:51:25,910 --> 00:51:28,820
I think it's the marketing and they 
think it's just marketing.

1188
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:29,850
See,
I just think you don't.

1189
00:51:29,870 --> 00:51:31,400
You don't see it?
I don't.

1190
00:51:31,790 --> 00:51:34,580
It's not that it can't be done.
I think people look at archetypes,

1191
00:51:34,581 --> 00:51:36,200
right?
They think like something that's already

1192
00:51:36,201 --> 00:51:38,350
been carved out.
Like Sarah Silverman.

1193
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:40,880
She's pretty and she talks dirty.
I can do that.

1194
00:51:40,970 --> 00:51:42,680
I've seen that.
And you see like these,

1195
00:51:42,820 --> 00:51:45,140
you know,
patrice o'neal used to call them babies.

1196
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:47,990
Like I got a lot of babies live comedy,
like,

1197
00:51:47,991 --> 00:51:48,824
you know,
these are my David tell got a lot of 

1198
00:51:50,091 --> 00:51:50,924
comedy babies and David Taylor had a ton
of comedy babies because people would 

1199
00:51:54,470 --> 00:51:56,600
imitate what they saw that was 
successful,

1200
00:51:56,810 --> 00:51:57,643
saw that thing.

1201
00:51:57,830 --> 00:51:58,491
And you go,
oh,

1202
00:51:58,491 --> 00:52:01,680
I know that I can do like that.
I could talk like Dave.

1203
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:05,780
And so there's these people that sort of
like imitated his cadence and rhythm and

1204
00:52:05,781 --> 00:52:08,660
it like some of them egregiously,
like some of them you're like,

1205
00:52:08,661 --> 00:52:10,600
Jesus Christ your bug.
Borderline a thief,

1206
00:52:10,810 --> 00:52:13,110
you know,
to.

1207
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:17,060
It's easier for the audience to identify
a woman as a,

1208
00:52:17,061 --> 00:52:17,894
this is the one I have sex with or this 
is not serious and I don't mean this as 

1209
00:52:22,311 --> 00:52:23,110
like a,
a,

1210
00:52:23,110 --> 00:52:24,900
a woe is me,
like literally,

1211
00:52:24,940 --> 00:52:25,671
like,
it's just,

1212
00:52:25,671 --> 00:52:26,504
it just,
I feel is either there's women that you 

1213
00:52:27,891 --> 00:52:29,430
fuck.
And then there's women that are,

1214
00:52:29,660 --> 00:52:32,320
that are off limits that are similar 
maternal I leave.

1215
00:52:32,330 --> 00:52:33,860
That's been my experience in the comedy 
world,

1216
00:52:34,410 --> 00:52:35,720
uh,
hanging out with dudes.

1217
00:52:35,721 --> 00:52:36,554
It was like the best thing that ever 
happened to me was hooking up with Tom 

1218
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:41,960
Cigarette because it put like a magical 
lasso,

1219
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:46,300
have a limits flexibility.

1220
00:52:46,530 --> 00:52:51,510
And immediately one of the friends I 
became a off limits per.

1221
00:52:51,580 --> 00:52:52,413
I became a person and it was great.
And I find that as I get older and 

1222
00:52:55,881 --> 00:52:59,030
become more like less,
the fuckability stuff goes down.

1223
00:52:59,031 --> 00:53:02,120
I really like it.
I really liked just being a human,

1224
00:53:02,650 --> 00:53:03,483
uh,
where I was going to fucking go with 

1225
00:53:05,571 --> 00:53:06,680
this.
Now I know what you're saying,

1226
00:53:06,681 --> 00:53:08,900
but do you think this is all in your own
head?

1227
00:53:08,950 --> 00:53:11,720
Yeah.
Maybe the all reality is right.

1228
00:53:11,950 --> 00:53:12,783
Aren't we all living in our own data 
because a lot of these archetypes that 

1229
00:53:17,541 --> 00:53:20,150
everybody sort of claims are 
inescapable.

1230
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:23,560
Then you'll see someone that doesn't fit
into that at all and you go,

1231
00:53:23,561 --> 00:53:25,860
oh,
well I didn't see that coming.

1232
00:53:26,130 --> 00:53:28,020
You know what I'm trying to think of 
like the big,

1233
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:31,620
the big female comics and they usually 
either one or the other.

1234
00:53:31,621 --> 00:53:34,150
Right.
It's either a mommy or about ellen.

1235
00:53:34,650 --> 00:53:36,220
Very asexual,
right?

1236
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:41,480
She's neither short hair and she's 
probably a ton of posts.

1237
00:53:42,410 --> 00:53:45,580
Yes,
I would love.

1238
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:47,153
Maybe she just gets her receipt and she 
gets her toes done and it's a box and I 

1239
00:53:53,180 --> 00:53:56,130
would love to hear her talk about eating
pussy and that be like my favorite thing

1240
00:53:56,131 --> 00:53:56,964
ever.
Wonder why don't she makes a face when 

1241
00:54:00,691 --> 00:54:01,524
she posted,
maybe she,

1242
00:54:01,740 --> 00:54:06,740
not she,
but she came up.

1243
00:54:13,550 --> 00:54:16,920
Maybe she's super gross about it.
I think she's super gross,

1244
00:54:17,170 --> 00:54:18,003
I think.
I think it's the people that are super 

1245
00:54:19,140 --> 00:54:21,450
one way publicly,
maybe privately.

1246
00:54:21,830 --> 00:54:22,663
She's real.
I've always thought about that about 

1247
00:54:24,271 --> 00:54:27,620
comedians.
You know the nicey Nice ones.

1248
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:30,090
Well,
not just the nicey nice ones,

1249
00:54:30,091 --> 00:54:33,960
but the over the top,
like defenders of women there turned out

1250
00:54:33,961 --> 00:54:34,794
to be super pervy.
We know a few of those always get 

1251
00:54:37,351 --> 00:54:39,690
busted.
Like,

1252
00:54:39,980 --> 00:54:41,880
you know,
like there's people that you can trust,

1253
00:54:41,881 --> 00:54:42,480
like,
you know,

1254
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:44,040
you know where you stand with Joey 
Dia's.

1255
00:54:44,220 --> 00:54:45,230
Yeah,
no,

1256
00:54:46,710 --> 00:54:47,543
absolutely.
I love Julia and I trust him because I 

1257
00:54:49,231 --> 00:54:50,064
know that's it.
Like I don't trust male comics that 

1258
00:54:51,511 --> 00:54:53,280
don't talk about their dicks.
Are Jerking it,

1259
00:54:53,490 --> 00:54:56,400
jerking off her pussy and stuff.
What do you.

1260
00:54:56,401 --> 00:54:58,640
What's the fucking.
Yeah.

1261
00:54:59,070 --> 00:55:01,410
Where's your darker?
The shadow self or whatever.

1262
00:55:01,411 --> 00:55:03,630
As they say,
if you're not addressing the darkness,

1263
00:55:03,631 --> 00:55:06,300
the darkness comes out uh,
elsewhere,

1264
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:07,193
right?

1265
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:11,640
The dog.
The dog comes out of the places.

1266
00:55:12,030 --> 00:55:13,980
Yeah.
Like I always wonder what Jim Gaffigan's

1267
00:55:13,981 --> 00:55:16,760
freak shit is.
He's so clever.

1268
00:55:16,810 --> 00:55:19,310
I don't know.
He might be the exception to the rule be

1269
00:55:19,380 --> 00:55:21,570
right.
Because he's so nice family guy.

1270
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:23,920
I think he really likes being a failure.
I don't,

1271
00:55:23,930 --> 00:55:26,790
I don't sense that shit from him.
Put cosby.

1272
00:55:26,791 --> 00:55:28,800
Oh God was this,
that was a surprise.

1273
00:55:28,801 --> 00:55:29,870
Yeah.
Was it though?

1274
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:31,740
Did you.
Did you ever hear the rumors?

1275
00:55:31,860 --> 00:55:32,693
No.
See I did in show business circles 

1276
00:55:34,771 --> 00:55:35,250
because,
uh,

1277
00:55:35,250 --> 00:55:36,083
briefly I lived in the actor's world 
right when I was on news radio and I 

1278
00:55:39,271 --> 00:55:41,760
would hear it and hear it back then that
he would drug people.

1279
00:55:41,780 --> 00:55:42,730
Really?
Yes,

1280
00:55:42,810 --> 00:55:43,800
yes,
yes.

1281
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:44,753
Yeah,
you would hear it.

1282
00:55:45,610 --> 00:55:48,300
It was like one of those weird rumors 
that would go around bill cosby drugs,

1283
00:55:48,301 --> 00:55:50,630
people,
dude,

1284
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:52,020
what's going on forever.
That's why Hannah,

1285
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:56,460
when Hannah talked about it on stage and
then it all blew up,

1286
00:55:56,580 --> 00:55:58,770
which is kind of crazy if you go 
Hannibal,

1287
00:55:59,100 --> 00:55:59,933
you know,
because he just happened to be talking 

1288
00:56:01,381 --> 00:56:02,214
about it and then someone happened to be
filming it and then the rest of the 

1289
00:56:04,501 --> 00:56:05,520
world was like,
is that true?

1290
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:06,473
Is that true?
Because bill cosby's always telling 

1291
00:56:08,011 --> 00:56:08,844
people to not swear talent.
Especially like he was big on telling 

1292
00:56:11,671 --> 00:56:15,720
young black comedians not swear enough 
to talk about sex and he's like,

1293
00:56:15,810 --> 00:56:16,643
he goes,
Bill cosby and until now at least I'm 

1294
00:56:17,371 --> 00:56:19,080
not raping people.
And everybody's like,

1295
00:56:20,330 --> 00:56:22,210
what?
What?

1296
00:56:22,930 --> 00:56:24,190
That was like.
The rumor

1297
00:56:24,190 --> 00:56:26,330
was always around.
I didn't,

1298
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:27,880
I,
I had heard some creepy,

1299
00:56:27,910 --> 00:56:29,990
a little creepiness,
the,

1300
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:33,250
but I didn't know,
but it was that extent when someone,

1301
00:56:33,850 --> 00:56:36,040
when someone does something like that to
people,

1302
00:56:36,041 --> 00:56:37,680
like that's one of the,
like

1303
00:56:38,420 --> 00:56:41,990
that's one of the creepiest fucking 
things a human can do to another human.

1304
00:56:41,991 --> 00:56:42,824
Yeah.
And the idea that this guy who was 

1305
00:56:45,321 --> 00:56:47,540
America's father,
right.

1306
00:56:47,541 --> 00:56:50,020
And a lot of ways he was our black dad,
you know,

1307
00:56:50,060 --> 00:56:51,790
he was the moral authority.
He was,

1308
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:53,880
he was Mr Huxtable.
Yeah.

1309
00:56:53,990 --> 00:56:56,450
You know,
and then the fact that that guy,

1310
00:56:56,930 --> 00:57:01,520
someone described him as the biggest 
serial rapist in the history of America,

1311
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:02,593
like that really might be the case 
because if he really did drug all these 

1312
00:57:06,291 --> 00:57:09,260
people that he said he did,
like how many people have raped more?

1313
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:10,190
He might be number one.

1314
00:57:10,190 --> 00:57:11,480
One,
which is crazy.

1315
00:57:11,481 --> 00:57:13,000
Insane.
It's crazy.

1316
00:57:13,190 --> 00:57:14,023
And the whole time.
And he's the darkest motherfucker ever 

1317
00:57:22,290 --> 00:57:23,870
darken.
Start drugging them,

1318
00:57:23,871 --> 00:57:28,871
watching them plastic fucking.
And he's got kids even more fucked up.

1319
00:57:29,270 --> 00:57:30,103
The crazy part was drug use or someone 
else's baby and sticking his dick and 

1320
00:57:33,111 --> 00:57:34,250
um,
other unconscious.

1321
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:36,830
It's so evil.
It's evil.

1322
00:57:37,220 --> 00:57:39,500
Now,
what about Harvey Weinstein?

1323
00:57:42,380 --> 00:57:44,450
And he's won.
Everyone knew about two apparently.

1324
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:46,100
Apparently.
Yeah.

1325
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:48,170
That's the um,
looks like.

1326
00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:50,030
Does the Cliche,
right?

1327
00:57:50,420 --> 00:57:51,253
The disgusting boss of the studio that 
wants you to suck his dick to get a 

1328
00:57:54,381 --> 00:57:55,214
role.
I know it's funny because you do think 

1329
00:57:57,591 --> 00:57:58,011
like,
well,

1330
00:57:58,011 --> 00:57:58,844
isn't that kind of why you become like a
show business executive to get chicks 

1331
00:58:01,881 --> 00:58:04,790
not to rape chicks.
Sexual assault is always off the table,

1332
00:58:04,791 --> 00:58:06,950
but,
but did he rape them or did.

1333
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:10,700
Now it's coming out that there's,
there's rape at last I checked today.

1334
00:58:11,290 --> 00:58:12,700
Uh,
I know he's,

1335
00:58:12,860 --> 00:58:13,693
and he is not a looker,
like he's definitely the type of guy 

1336
00:58:16,851 --> 00:58:20,300
that would be the type of guy he is,
which is what's fucked up.

1337
00:58:20,670 --> 00:58:23,120
Suicide threat prompts.
Police response.

1338
00:58:23,121 --> 00:58:24,650
Whoa.
Were there,

1339
00:58:24,651 --> 00:58:27,320
Huh?
Fight with his daughter this morning.

1340
00:58:27,321 --> 00:58:30,530
And they had to.
She called the nine one one damn.

1341
00:58:30,550 --> 00:58:32,150
Because he was gonna kill himself or 
something.

1342
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:32,840
I don't know.

1343
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:33,673
It must be so overwhelmed with guilt and
fear and remorse and just self hatred 

1344
00:58:39,921 --> 00:58:42,230
and you know,
he sounds like an addict,

1345
00:58:42,620 --> 00:58:43,840
you know?
Yeah.

1346
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:44,833
Yeah.
And that he's also a probably a power 

1347
00:58:47,211 --> 00:58:48,620
addict,
you know,

1348
00:58:48,621 --> 00:58:52,070
like he's this guy who's like this 
gluttonous man.

1349
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:54,260
Like if you look at his physical self,
right,

1350
00:58:54,560 --> 00:58:55,393
his face is over,
flowing on his collar and he's just 

1351
00:58:58,970 --> 00:59:03,030
gluttonous food.
Where's the plus?

1352
00:59:05,260 --> 00:59:06,093
There's this gluttonous existence.
It's not like a measured thought out 

1353
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:16,160
contemplatives introspective existence 
where he's just trying to enjoy his time

1354
00:59:16,161 --> 00:59:16,821
here.
Like wow,

1355
00:59:16,821 --> 00:59:20,000
how lucky I am that I get to do this and
make these amazing movies.

1356
00:59:20,180 --> 00:59:21,600
You guys were all great.
That's,

1357
00:59:21,620 --> 00:59:22,453
I expect from like Steven Spielberg,
Steven Spielberg to be like this really 

1358
00:59:25,821 --> 00:59:28,170
like introspective,
thoughtful guy.

1359
00:59:28,171 --> 00:59:31,250
I was just enjoying the process of 
making amazing movies,

1360
00:59:32,220 --> 00:59:35,600
but he's a creative thing.
Harvey's and Executive Guy,

1361
00:59:35,660 --> 00:59:36,530
right?
He's the guy,

1362
00:59:36,531 --> 00:59:40,060
the money guy behind everything and Vr,
something like that.

1363
00:59:43,110 --> 00:59:44,970
It is so nasty.
So gross.

1364
00:59:44,990 --> 00:59:46,890
But okay.
Now on the other hand,

1365
00:59:47,310 --> 00:59:48,960
on the other hand,
I was like,

1366
00:59:49,080 --> 00:59:49,913
you know,
Hollywood is such a labyrinth in terms 

1367
00:59:51,481 --> 00:59:54,270
of like getting shit done and getting 
deals closed.

1368
00:59:54,271 --> 00:59:55,500
And how did this,
does this happen?

1369
00:59:55,980 --> 00:59:59,430
It would kind of be nice to be like,
you want to Netflix special,

1370
00:59:59,790 --> 01:00:03,270
just go fucking suck,
and then I can be like,

1371
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:04,440
oh,
that's all I have to do.

1372
01:00:04,441 --> 01:00:06,750
It's something that guys come over here,
you nasty.

1373
01:00:06,751 --> 01:00:09,680
Fuck.
And then there's your special right?

1374
01:00:10,620 --> 01:00:13,590
Way Easier would you have to have a 
conversation with Tommy?

1375
01:00:13,620 --> 01:00:18,620
Listen Tommy,
this is not sex work.

1376
01:00:19,230 --> 01:00:20,063
Right?
And then it's like cut and dry and it's 

1377
01:00:21,661 --> 01:00:22,830
an exchange.
You know,

1378
01:00:22,831 --> 01:00:25,500
I was in law school for two weeks and I 
remember two weeks,

1379
01:00:25,501 --> 01:00:27,720
two weeks and I dropped out in contract 
law.

1380
01:00:27,780 --> 01:00:30,030
It's an exchange of something for 
something else.

1381
01:00:30,370 --> 01:00:33,630
Seems fucking pretty straightforward.
Well that's what prostitution is,

1382
01:00:33,640 --> 01:00:34,473
right?
Because one of the weirdest things that 

1383
01:00:35,101 --> 01:00:37,530
massage is legal,
but prostitution isn't.

1384
01:00:37,750 --> 01:00:39,040
Isn't that something?
It is.

1385
01:00:39,160 --> 01:00:41,760
It is odd because we do not like genital
pleasure,

1386
01:00:42,020 --> 01:00:45,720
not like genital pleasure for cash,
like general pleasure has to be for love

1387
01:00:45,860 --> 01:00:47,050
and be loved,
right?

1388
01:00:47,070 --> 01:00:52,070
It has to be given free is the only 
thing in civilization that we require to

1389
01:00:52,501 --> 01:00:53,334
be given away for free.
Everything else you can exchange money 

1390
01:00:55,651 --> 01:00:57,150
for.
It's an interesting change.

1391
01:00:57,151 --> 01:00:58,650
Money for food,
right?

1392
01:00:58,651 --> 01:01:00,930
It's not prostitution.
If someone cooks for you,

1393
01:01:00,990 --> 01:01:02,400
right.
That's normal.

1394
01:01:02,420 --> 01:01:04,890
So total normal thing,
but it's a very intimate thing.

1395
01:01:04,891 --> 01:01:06,540
Feeding someone.
Yes,

1396
01:01:06,541 --> 01:01:07,160
yes,
of course.

1397
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:07,993
It's a hair salon.
The wash your head to give you a head 

1398
01:01:10,351 --> 01:01:11,184
massage.
For one thing I miss about having hair 

1399
01:01:13,690 --> 01:01:15,930
rubbed my head.
Oh,

1400
01:01:16,860 --> 01:01:18,300
it's the best feeling in the world.

1401
01:01:18,530 --> 01:01:23,340
Massage or foot massage.
People love foot massages.

1402
01:01:23,640 --> 01:01:26,150
I bet there's people out there that like
foot massages more than than like head,

1403
01:01:26,890 --> 01:01:27,900
but yeah,
for sure.

1404
01:01:28,020 --> 01:01:28,680
For sure.
For sure.

1405
01:01:28,680 --> 01:01:29,513
Right.
But then you put a camera in front of 

1406
01:01:31,861 --> 01:01:33,510
two people.
Fucking totally illegal.

1407
01:01:33,511 --> 01:01:34,730
Now it's legal.
You're paying pam.

1408
01:01:35,010 --> 01:01:37,020
So what's were retarded.
Yeah,

1409
01:01:37,021 --> 01:01:37,854
that makes no sense.
Babies were grown up babies because you 

1410
01:01:40,321 --> 01:01:43,650
can commodify that and that's a 
capitalistic thing.

1411
01:01:43,830 --> 01:01:46,710
Maybe it's more commodifiable as a 
product is.

1412
01:01:46,711 --> 01:01:49,470
Absolutely.
I think there's two factors.

1413
01:01:49,530 --> 01:01:50,363
One is the tax factor.
It's very difficult to get taxes from 

1414
01:01:52,801 --> 01:01:54,400
people that are prostitutes,
right?

1415
01:01:54,570 --> 01:01:54,981
It's like,
no,

1416
01:01:54,981 --> 01:01:55,250
no,
no,

1417
01:01:55,250 --> 01:01:55,520
no,
no,

1418
01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:55,900
no,
no,

1419
01:01:55,900 --> 01:01:56,733
none of that.

1420
01:01:57,030 --> 01:01:58,140
Where's that money going?
Give us,

1421
01:01:58,270 --> 01:01:59,103
give us our cut.
And then the other thing is the sex 

1422
01:02:03,451 --> 01:02:06,750
trafficking,
sex slavery aspect,

1423
01:02:06,900 --> 01:02:11,040
like protecting people that are sex 
traffickers because like,

1424
01:02:11,190 --> 01:02:12,023
you know,
you could have someone that was sold 

1425
01:02:12,781 --> 01:02:13,614
into sex slavery or you know,
in some way bartered their trip to 

1426
01:02:18,301 --> 01:02:21,900
America,
had some sort of a sex slave deal.

1427
01:02:22,260 --> 01:02:23,093
That's where it gets fucked up.
But there has been arguments that what 

1428
01:02:25,111 --> 01:02:30,111
makes that exists in the first place.
Is it prostitution is illegal here and a

1429
01:02:30,150 --> 01:02:32,760
prostitution was legal.
It would be.

1430
01:02:32,820 --> 01:02:33,653
That stuff would all go away.
Much like the argument is with illegal 

1431
01:02:36,721 --> 01:02:39,510
drugs,
like if you made marijuana legal,

1432
01:02:39,660 --> 01:02:42,560
you wouldn't have as much of the Mexican
drug trade,

1433
01:02:43,230 --> 01:02:46,230
which you are seeing,
you are seeing in America.

1434
01:02:46,290 --> 01:02:48,680
Of course it's retarded and a wait.

1435
01:02:48,810 --> 01:02:51,060
But wait,
Harvey,

1436
01:02:51,090 --> 01:02:54,420
he was the guy that would give girls the
shoulder rubs.

1437
01:02:54,560 --> 01:02:56,840
He would tell them to massage him.
Oh,

1438
01:02:56,841 --> 01:02:59,750
he was massage them,
did massage him.

1439
01:03:00,050 --> 01:03:02,420
He would do according to these girls.
I don't know if it's true,

1440
01:03:02,421 --> 01:03:03,254
but he would.
He'd be the guy that I'll be right back 

1441
01:03:04,760 --> 01:03:07,610
and he comes back in a bathrobe bathrobe
guy.

1442
01:03:07,980 --> 01:03:10,010
So here's the thing.
Here's the thing,

1443
01:03:10,011 --> 01:03:10,844
I don't mean to make light of anybody's 
sexual assault or whatever it was or 

1444
01:03:15,261 --> 01:03:17,300
harassment,
but other working on the roof again,

1445
01:03:17,570 --> 01:03:18,560
wonderful,
but,

1446
01:03:18,590 --> 01:03:20,480
but what I.
But here's the thing,

1447
01:03:20,481 --> 01:03:23,770
how many women said yes,
that's a fuck load.

1448
01:03:23,771 --> 01:03:27,500
Like that was his move.
What we're seeing is his missed pitches,

1449
01:03:27,850 --> 01:03:28,790
right?
Right.

1450
01:03:28,820 --> 01:03:32,060
He hit a lot of fucking triples and home
runs,

1451
01:03:32,180 --> 01:03:33,013
knocked a lot of balls out of the park,
but occasionally he was whipping 

1452
01:03:36,110 --> 01:03:37,670
occasionally.
He was like,

1453
01:03:37,671 --> 01:03:39,890
I got this one in the back boys and 
she's like,

1454
01:03:39,950 --> 01:03:41,630
fuck off you pig.
And he's like,

1455
01:03:41,631 --> 01:03:42,200
ah,
come on.

1456
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:43,250
Just come back to my room.
No,

1457
01:03:43,251 --> 01:03:43,630
no,
no.

1458
01:03:43,630 --> 01:03:44,660
Just like,
shut down.

1459
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:47,790
What happened?
Harvey just wasn't connecting.

1460
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:49,130
I wasn't connecting,
but listen,

1461
01:03:49,131 --> 01:03:51,560
I got all this girl wants to be in the 
next [inaudible],

1462
01:03:52,010 --> 01:03:54,200
this movie and the Avatar.
16.

1463
01:03:55,300 --> 01:03:58,920
Willing to do the thing to get the part 
and that's kind of okay.

1464
01:03:58,950 --> 01:04:00,330
Yeah.
Then then like that guys,

1465
01:04:00,331 --> 01:04:02,290
they can get the part and get your money
and get on with it.

1466
01:04:02,520 --> 01:04:03,353
How many girls read the story when it 
broke and could still taste the 

1467
01:04:06,900 --> 01:04:07,733
asparagus?
Caviar flavored come just the cocaine 

1468
01:04:13,240 --> 01:04:18,240
and vodka in his loads and I bet he has 
like a Flemmi like Moan when he comes.

1469
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:30,650
He's a kind of get sleep.
Yes.

1470
01:04:30,770 --> 01:04:31,603
Battle in the corners of his mouth.
When he talked to you trying to hit on 

1471
01:04:34,401 --> 01:04:38,010
you.
He's got a little bit bubble lip.

1472
01:04:38,670 --> 01:04:40,220
He nasty,
nasty,

1473
01:04:40,250 --> 01:04:41,083
nasty.
That's a gluttonous man right out of 

1474
01:04:43,551 --> 01:04:44,870
control.
It's not attractive.

1475
01:04:45,320 --> 01:04:46,153
It's definitely not at all.
My favorite too is that he would jerk 

1476
01:04:48,171 --> 01:04:49,700
off into.
Did you hear this?

1477
01:04:49,701 --> 01:04:50,534
But he plants was green.
He wants to exist off of his loads but 

1478
01:04:56,091 --> 01:04:58,160
that's such a desperate thing.
Like come over.

1479
01:04:58,220 --> 01:04:59,240
Can we get it?
Can I have it?

1480
01:04:59,241 --> 01:04:59,811
No.
Okay.

1481
01:04:59,811 --> 01:05:00,950
You stay here then let me,
you know,

1482
01:05:00,951 --> 01:05:02,000
like it's.
So

1483
01:05:02,300 --> 01:05:04,130
maybe it was hoping they would just dive
on a grenade.

1484
01:05:06,350 --> 01:05:10,370
Gave a soldier.
But I know so

1485
01:05:10,370 --> 01:05:11,650
like I was thinking too.
Look,

1486
01:05:11,660 --> 01:05:12,493
I've,
I've seen so many dudes jerking off in 

1487
01:05:14,031 --> 01:05:17,770
public like homeless guys.
I never got anything for it.

1488
01:05:18,340 --> 01:05:19,210
Is it?
You know,

1489
01:05:20,230 --> 01:05:21,460
good point.
Yeah.

1490
01:05:23,290 --> 01:05:24,123
You guys look,
here's the thing about male versus 

1491
01:05:27,911 --> 01:05:28,810
female sex,
right?

1492
01:05:28,811 --> 01:05:33,400
Is the accepting part of female sex 
versus the giving,

1493
01:05:33,430 --> 01:05:35,140
like trying to get,
take this,

1494
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:36,033
take it.
And the other thing is that men take it 

1495
01:05:39,160 --> 01:05:43,720
literally or constantly building come 
while you're alive.

1496
01:05:44,020 --> 01:05:46,600
You come as backing up,
so if you're,

1497
01:05:46,630 --> 01:05:48,970
if you're not like I used to have the 
bit in my art,

1498
01:05:49,060 --> 01:05:49,893
that was,
it was really based on advice that I 

1499
01:05:51,371 --> 01:05:54,750
used to give friends when they're like,
oh no girl wants to get marines.

1500
01:05:54,760 --> 01:05:59,740
I listened me jerk off first and then 
think about it like if you're,

1501
01:05:59,741 --> 01:06:01,900
if you're having a hard time with 
someone and you're,

1502
01:06:01,901 --> 01:06:02,734
you don't know what to do and you're 
going to see them jerk off first and 

1503
01:06:05,681 --> 01:06:09,400
then see them and then you'll be able to
deal with them without any sexual lust.

1504
01:06:09,580 --> 01:06:13,330
You won't make it because of me.
As far as a young man,

1505
01:06:13,390 --> 01:06:16,990
this is a real issue with me when I was 
in my twenties because I was so horny,

1506
01:06:17,110 --> 01:06:20,020
it was like I was a drug addict so I'd 
be like,

1507
01:06:20,021 --> 01:06:20,854
oh,
it'd be like making agreements with 

1508
01:06:21,581 --> 01:06:22,091
myself.
Yeah,

1509
01:06:22,091 --> 01:06:22,924
she's annoying,
but she's going to let me have sex with 

1510
01:06:24,131 --> 01:06:25,000
her,
so listen,

1511
01:06:25,030 --> 01:06:25,863
just let's just change our behavior and 
mold to what she likes and then you'll 

1512
01:06:29,531 --> 01:06:32,830
get the fucker is that's what you need.
Like otherwise just be beating off.

1513
01:06:33,010 --> 01:06:33,843
But I remember one time I was supposed 
to go out with this girl and she was 

1514
01:06:36,701 --> 01:06:40,930
just so preposterously annoying.
It was so frustrating.

1515
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:44,080
She just was always negative and before 
we went out,

1516
01:06:44,170 --> 01:06:47,830
before I went to go get her,
I jerked off and I was sitting there.

1517
01:06:47,831 --> 01:06:48,790
I was going,
what am I doing?

1518
01:06:48,850 --> 01:06:52,060
Like I don't even enjoy her company.
She's not compatible with me.

1519
01:06:52,360 --> 01:06:53,193
Like I don't if you can,
if you would just like someone as a 

1520
01:06:56,741 --> 01:06:59,260
person and you like having sex with 
them.

1521
01:06:59,380 --> 01:07:00,213
That's a relationship.
But if you only like having sex with 

1522
01:07:02,411 --> 01:07:03,244
them,
you have some sort of a weird bartered 

1523
01:07:04,870 --> 01:07:05,703
deal and that's a lot of men.
A lot of men get in and I'm sure a lot 

1524
01:07:09,041 --> 01:07:09,874
of women probably too,
but I can only speak for men like men 

1525
01:07:12,281 --> 01:07:13,114
get involved in these relationships 
where you're really just in a 

1526
01:07:15,761 --> 01:07:16,594
relationship.
So that you have a continuous supply of 

1527
01:07:18,821 --> 01:07:21,100
sex,
especially when you're young and stupid.

1528
01:07:21,250 --> 01:07:23,770
When you're 20 years old,
you're basically a monkey.

1529
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:24,651
You know,
you're,

1530
01:07:24,651 --> 01:07:25,484
you're just like a little eight person 
just trying to fuck and you just try to 

1531
01:07:28,010 --> 01:07:29,200
love her.
She's really cool.

1532
01:07:29,201 --> 01:07:30,090
And why do you love her?

1533
01:07:30,100 --> 01:07:32,410
Because she smells good because her tits
feel good in your mouth.

1534
01:07:32,411 --> 01:07:34,570
Like what?
What is really going on?

1535
01:07:35,080 --> 01:07:39,160
Do you actually enjoy her company as a 
human being outside of sex?

1536
01:07:39,350 --> 01:07:40,290
It doesn't matter,
right?

1537
01:07:40,330 --> 01:07:41,163
Most of the time you don't.
And so if you could just jerk off first 

1538
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:47,380
and then hang out with someone you 
actually liked them,

1539
01:07:47,750 --> 01:07:51,280
like then you have a real relationship.
Like oh I really like you.

1540
01:07:51,310 --> 01:07:53,620
Like,
like you clear out the pipes,

1541
01:07:54,190 --> 01:07:59,020
clear out the testosterone and think 
clearly super smart.

1542
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:01,510
But I think,
I mean I'm just guessing.

1543
01:08:02,260 --> 01:08:03,093
I've never been a media mogul,
but I would imagine there's a bunch of 

1544
01:08:07,631 --> 01:08:09,400
factors going on.
First of all,

1545
01:08:09,401 --> 01:08:13,950
there's a bunch of people that are 
constantly kissing his ass and rubbing.

1546
01:08:14,080 --> 01:08:14,913
Like I saw a picture him with Renee 
Zellweger and Renee Zellweger was like 

1547
01:08:18,831 --> 01:08:19,664
cuddling up with them and she had her 
hand on him and he had his arm on her 

1548
01:08:22,460 --> 01:08:25,100
and there was some other celebrity to 
his right and there were like,

1549
01:08:25,101 --> 01:08:25,641
Yuck,
Yuck,

1550
01:08:25,641 --> 01:08:26,474
Yuck it up.

1551
01:08:26,630 --> 01:08:30,650
But he was like pawn her.
He had a hold of her and I would imagine

1552
01:08:30,651 --> 01:08:31,484
that there's all these people that 
recognize that he's just like epicenter 

1553
01:08:34,431 --> 01:08:39,431
of power and success and you want Harvey
Weinstein of Miramax to love you and you

1554
01:08:41,421 --> 01:08:42,254
would get close to him and you have a 
couple of drinks and you're doing coke 

1555
01:08:45,201 --> 01:08:45,800
together.
Yeah,

1556
01:08:45,800 --> 01:08:46,633
look at that.
She's got her hand on his leg and he's 

1557
01:08:48,801 --> 01:08:53,230
got Russell Crowe to his right and Renee
Zellweger to his left and she's smiling.

1558
01:08:53,270 --> 01:08:56,360
They're probably hammered and everyone's
on Xanax.

1559
01:08:56,540 --> 01:08:59,210
Next scene.
Now he's got his dick in her butt.

1560
01:08:59,390 --> 01:09:00,650
That's crazy,
dude.

1561
01:09:00,780 --> 01:09:04,610
She's imagining Jones' diary number two,
number six.

1562
01:09:04,690 --> 01:09:05,810
Correct.
Fine with me.

1563
01:09:05,811 --> 01:09:06,644
I don't know if that really happened,
but my point is that it's not just that 

1564
01:09:10,041 --> 01:09:14,150
he was predatory,
it was also that he lived.

1565
01:09:14,480 --> 01:09:15,720
I'm just guessing.
Okay,

1566
01:09:16,070 --> 01:09:16,903
I'm not an apologist folks,
but I would imagine that he lived in 

1567
01:09:20,031 --> 01:09:23,660
this world where he was like royalty.

1568
01:09:23,660 --> 01:09:27,380
He was essentially like the king of this
empire.

1569
01:09:27,410 --> 01:09:29,810
Right.
So you had all these employees is one of

1570
01:09:29,811 --> 01:09:30,644
the articles that I read today,
I think it was from the Telegraph where 

1571
01:09:32,751 --> 01:09:34,760
this guy was saying that,
um,

1572
01:09:34,940 --> 01:09:35,773
he was at a party or one of his friends 
was at a party and they were having a 

1573
01:09:40,251 --> 01:09:41,084
conversation with this girl who worked 
for Harvey and Harvey just set her name 

1574
01:09:46,221 --> 01:09:47,054
from across the room and her face went 
pale and she immediately just ran away 

1575
01:09:50,511 --> 01:09:52,130
from him to run to her.
Like didn't say,

1576
01:09:52,131 --> 01:09:53,540
excuse me,
I'll be right back.

1577
01:09:53,541 --> 01:09:56,360
Just ran at a fear.
Who knows?

1578
01:09:56,540 --> 01:09:57,670
That is obvious.
It.

1579
01:09:57,770 --> 01:09:58,603
Can he be interpretation after the fact.
It could be exaggeration of what the 

1580
01:10:02,331 --> 01:10:04,430
actual circumstances were to fit a 
narrative,

1581
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:09,530
but you got to imagine that this guy is 
just multimodal tie millionaire.

1582
01:10:09,860 --> 01:10:12,980
Just orgiastic,
gluttonous.

1583
01:10:12,981 --> 01:10:16,010
Jabba the Hutt motherfucker just getting
as.

1584
01:10:16,570 --> 01:10:20,220
And we're going to be the biggest,
the biggest driver.

1585
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:26,570
And then there's also these girls he 
can't get and he's like close to them,

1586
01:10:26,630 --> 01:10:29,510
close to the anger.
Right?

1587
01:10:29,511 --> 01:10:30,344
Listen Christina,
you're the one that he cut his hand on 

1588
01:10:31,851 --> 01:10:32,684
you.
One of the best when they come into my 

1589
01:10:35,481 --> 01:10:36,530
room.
Let's talk about this.

1590
01:10:36,840 --> 01:10:38,150
A proposal.
I've got a proposal.

1591
01:10:38,350 --> 01:10:40,120
You come up to his room,
he's got a bathrobe on.

1592
01:10:40,130 --> 01:10:40,963
You're like,
what?

1593
01:10:42,370 --> 01:10:44,490
Just give me a massage.
My neck is tense.

1594
01:10:44,650 --> 01:10:48,220
I'm not going to send you like coke.
What about cocaine?

1595
01:10:48,230 --> 01:10:53,230
Caviar,
cocaine carrier altogether that is.

1596
01:10:53,810 --> 01:10:57,230
He is unbelievably him and I have to 
say,

1597
01:10:57,231 --> 01:11:00,560
and I know Hugh hefner was a big mogul 
and he did a lot of cool shit.

1598
01:11:01,100 --> 01:11:04,970
Not For me.
That would be a tough gig to like living

1599
01:11:04,971 --> 01:11:09,650
in the mansion and being one of the 
girls come over for movie night,

1600
01:11:09,950 --> 01:11:10,783
you know,
and he's in his pajamas and you know 

1601
01:11:11,961 --> 01:11:14,040
that he bought them because

1602
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:18,090
he didn't want to get anyone pregnant.
So that's what I read in.

1603
01:11:18,150 --> 01:11:20,780
What is it?
Holly Holly Madison wrote,

1604
01:11:21,020 --> 01:11:23,390
I wrote a book.
Is that her name is Dolly Madison.

1605
01:11:23,391 --> 01:11:24,224
Is the pastry like who the fuck is that?
They didn't have to worry about birth 

1606
01:11:30,661 --> 01:11:31,620
controls.
Correct.

1607
01:11:31,621 --> 01:11:32,454
And then there's a lot of like he,
he would make the girls make out in 

1608
01:11:35,131 --> 01:11:37,680
front of him and then he would 
masturbate too.

1609
01:11:37,681 --> 01:11:38,514
It's also kind of,
I think is a way of avoiding possible 

1610
01:11:40,350 --> 01:11:44,280
pregnancies.
So we developed a strategy over year.

1611
01:11:44,310 --> 01:11:48,160
They're like ducking pregnancies.
Wow.

1612
01:11:48,161 --> 01:11:50,010
That's,
that's a weird thing to write,

1613
01:11:50,011 --> 01:11:50,844
to be putting yourself out there as this
person with a lot of money who really 

1614
01:11:54,931 --> 01:11:56,550
loves young girls and the young girls 
go.

1615
01:11:56,551 --> 01:12:01,520
All I have to do is catch one load at 
the right time.

1616
01:12:01,650 --> 01:12:02,483
Stories about athletes that girls put 
holes in the condoms or the girl girls 

1617
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:08,790
take the condoms out of the trash and 
score them into their posting.

1618
01:12:10,830 --> 01:12:12,270
Imagine.
How was I born,

1619
01:12:12,271 --> 01:12:15,180
Mommy?
Well,

1620
01:12:15,181 --> 01:12:16,014
it's a lovely story.
Umami Umami took a condom like one of 

1621
01:12:20,131 --> 01:12:23,820
the pastry bags and quarter that fucker 
in.

1622
01:12:25,230 --> 01:12:28,980
Well your mother fish to filthy condom 
out of the trash.

1623
01:12:29,680 --> 01:12:34,500
I tended to throw it in the toilet,
but I had one saved in my mouth.

1624
01:12:34,980 --> 01:12:37,590
Spit that one in the toilet and that's 
why you're alive.

1625
01:12:39,270 --> 01:12:40,103
Wild wild.
But then I heard that the playboy 

1626
01:12:42,781 --> 01:12:46,130
mansion,
she wrote that it was run down and uh,

1627
01:12:46,140 --> 01:12:49,380
they had like bunk beds and shit in the 
rooms and like,

1628
01:12:49,381 --> 01:12:51,930
it's not,
it wasn't as glamorous as everybody.

1629
01:12:52,020 --> 01:12:57,020
I couldn't touch factor fear factor 
playmate edition.

1630
01:12:57,450 --> 01:12:58,560
And I was like,
Huh,

1631
01:12:58,680 --> 01:12:59,513
this is it.
I got to go see that at the grotto was 

1632
01:13:02,401 --> 01:13:03,234
um,
there were the people that worked there 

1633
01:13:05,161 --> 01:13:06,840
were very nice.
The girls were very nice,

1634
01:13:07,110 --> 01:13:10,590
but there's like a,
there's a thing that you're experiencing

1635
01:13:11,490 --> 01:13:13,470
where it's like they don't have a whole 
lot of options.

1636
01:13:13,770 --> 01:13:17,070
So it's like it's an option for them to 
be a part of this.

1637
01:13:17,160 --> 01:13:20,700
And some of them loved it for sure.
Some of them it was what they wanted.

1638
01:13:21,030 --> 01:13:23,400
And for some of them there's like a 
sadness to it.

1639
01:13:23,910 --> 01:13:24,743
It's like.
And it's also some of them when we did 

1640
01:13:26,371 --> 01:13:27,204
fear factor,
like some of them were like older 

1641
01:13:28,021 --> 01:13:28,854
playmates,
so they've been playmates like 10 years 

1642
01:13:29,941 --> 01:13:30,774
ago or 15 years.
So they were like pushing 30 and maybe 

1643
01:13:32,941 --> 01:13:34,470
even older.
They're like,

1644
01:13:34,471 --> 01:13:35,304
what am I going to do soon?
Like what am I going to do in five 

1645
01:13:37,921 --> 01:13:39,720
years,
what am I going to do in 10 years?

1646
01:13:39,780 --> 01:13:42,090
And then there's not a lot of answers on
the horizon.

1647
01:13:42,300 --> 01:13:43,133
So they'll go looking for maybe some old
rich husband type character or maybe 

1648
01:13:48,031 --> 01:13:50,220
some way out financially,
you know,

1649
01:13:50,221 --> 01:13:52,200
maybe have some business that they can 
start,

1650
01:13:52,220 --> 01:13:53,270
you know,
some clothing line,

1651
01:13:53,271 --> 01:13:57,420
like everyone's got a hustle and a scam,
but they essentially don't really have a

1652
01:13:57,421 --> 01:13:57,960
career.

1653
01:13:57,960 --> 01:14:01,380
They have like this sort of like opening
into this world.

1654
01:14:01,830 --> 01:14:03,510
And then they would have the mansion 
parties.

1655
01:14:03,511 --> 01:14:04,440
Right.
Which I,

1656
01:14:04,760 --> 01:14:07,920
I went to one for the marijuana policy 
project.

1657
01:14:07,921 --> 01:14:10,080
I hosted this thing,
this event.

1658
01:14:11,070 --> 01:14:12,790
It was,
it was very weird.

1659
01:14:13,190 --> 01:14:16,120
It was like they have bands playing and 
stuff and you're just walking around and

1660
01:14:16,121 --> 01:14:18,040
just pot everywhere and everyone's 
stoned out of their mind.

1661
01:14:18,041 --> 01:14:18,874
It was,
it was an extra surreal because of the 

1662
01:14:20,741 --> 01:14:23,260
pot factor.
But like you go by where,

1663
01:14:23,320 --> 01:14:26,170
where he had pets.
It's like birds and monkeys and shit.

1664
01:14:26,171 --> 01:14:29,590
Like what the fuck is this place?
Everybody's high as fuck,

1665
01:14:29,980 --> 01:14:31,450
but it's just the,
the,

1666
01:14:31,550 --> 01:14:33,460
the,
and there was no playmates for that one.

1667
01:14:33,461 --> 01:14:34,294
That was weird because that was one of 
the ones you rent out and so lecherous 

1668
01:14:37,721 --> 01:14:39,580
guys went there.
They will go to the mainland.

1669
01:14:40,030 --> 01:14:41,050
They rented it out.

1670
01:14:41,110 --> 01:14:41,960
Sweets?
No,

1671
01:14:42,130 --> 01:14:44,470
no.
They rent out the use of the mansion.

1672
01:14:45,330 --> 01:14:47,590
Yeah.
So you can use the garage.

1673
01:14:47,620 --> 01:14:49,410
You can come in the grotto where 
everyone else comes.

1674
01:14:50,050 --> 01:14:52,930
General public want to jerk off in the 
grotto.

1675
01:14:53,260 --> 01:14:55,090
I don't know if they actually let people
in the grotto.

1676
01:14:55,091 --> 01:14:56,320
When I was.
I don't remember.

1677
01:14:56,380 --> 01:14:59,030
It was quite a long time ago,
but I do remember like the,

1678
01:14:59,031 --> 01:15:04,031
the grotto had this phone from like the 
19 seventies old ass fucked up fondly.

1679
01:15:05,080 --> 01:15:07,960
The upkeep on a place like that.
It's probably super expensive.

1680
01:15:07,961 --> 01:15:08,794
There's the phone look it up,
old wack ass phone and all the buttons 

1681
01:15:13,151 --> 01:15:13,984
for the lights and Shit and you know,
he wasn't going to put money into 

1682
01:15:17,081 --> 01:15:19,390
renovating that shit because he was old.
He was like,

1683
01:15:19,391 --> 01:15:22,390
I'm dying.
I also think there wasn't money.

1684
01:15:23,010 --> 01:15:28,010
I don't think that the mansion,
the mansion was a location that actually

1685
01:15:28,241 --> 01:15:29,470
made money,
right,

1686
01:15:29,471 --> 01:15:32,170
because it was like a destination and 
they would rent it out for stuff,

1687
01:15:32,500 --> 01:15:34,360
but I don't think the magazine was 
making money.

1688
01:15:34,360 --> 01:15:35,193
I think the magazine was really 
struggling once the Internet happened 

1689
01:15:37,451 --> 01:15:42,160
and you can get pornography for free and
you can actually see everything.

1690
01:15:42,180 --> 01:15:43,060
The whole thing.
Yeah.

1691
01:15:43,061 --> 01:15:44,810
Why?
Why buy playboy?

1692
01:15:44,820 --> 01:15:45,611
Like the.
Oh,

1693
01:15:45,611 --> 01:15:47,980
I can say purely can just see when they 
took the.

1694
01:15:48,370 --> 01:15:50,290
They took nudity out for like a whole 
year.

1695
01:15:50,350 --> 01:15:52,030
What are you talking about?
They did,

1696
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:53,680
yes,
because they were.

1697
01:15:53,710 --> 01:15:54,850
They were getting crazy.
They're like,

1698
01:15:54,851 --> 01:15:58,500
we're going to be maximum show girls.
Okay.

1699
01:15:58,620 --> 01:15:59,453
Carousel.
He did for a little while and just the 

1700
01:16:01,510 --> 01:16:05,500
sales tanked.
The crashed even maximum smack,

1701
01:16:05,850 --> 01:16:06,683
you know,
on a military base in the British ones 

1702
01:16:09,190 --> 01:16:10,023
that they let them look at Teddy mags.
Like they can get maximum magazine and 

1703
01:16:13,571 --> 01:16:16,720
stuff.
Not The American military does not allow

1704
01:16:16,721 --> 01:16:17,554
you to look at Teddy mags and the 
American military has a very high rate 

1705
01:16:20,920 --> 01:16:23,590
of sexual assault.
Do you know that?

1706
01:16:23,590 --> 01:16:27,640
I've been to the Middle East,
Afghanistan and a lot of those bases and

1707
01:16:27,641 --> 01:16:28,474
I've heard bad stories is apparently a 
giant issue that is very suppressed 

1708
01:16:33,580 --> 01:16:38,140
because you're not dealing with like law
in terms of like civilian law.

1709
01:16:38,200 --> 01:16:41,560
You're dealing with like military law.
So yeah,

1710
01:16:41,650 --> 01:16:43,090
I don't.
I don't know what the real numbers are,

1711
01:16:43,091 --> 01:16:46,660
but I've read quite a few stories about 
that's a real issue.

1712
01:16:46,760 --> 01:16:47,593
If you don't give them an outlet,
you know you have a bunch of people who 

1713
01:16:50,971 --> 01:16:52,630
are watching their friends heads get 
blown up.

1714
01:16:52,840 --> 01:16:53,673
That's the thing you're on.
Your whole reality is out the window 

1715
01:16:56,861 --> 01:16:57,694
when you're at war,
and I'm not excusing anyone for sexual 

1716
01:16:59,291 --> 01:17:00,124
assault,
but I'm saying like the world that 

1717
01:17:02,801 --> 01:17:03,634
you're living in at home and then you 
are in Afghanistan and bullets are 

1718
01:17:06,851 --> 01:17:08,830
whizzing by.
Who knows what.

1719
01:17:08,831 --> 01:17:09,770
These kids

1720
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:10,940
go.
Their kids,

1721
01:17:10,941 --> 01:17:11,774
right?
Who knows what the fuck they learned 

1722
01:17:13,221 --> 01:17:15,320
back home.
Who knows what their situation is,

1723
01:17:15,410 --> 01:17:18,840
who knows if they got into the army as 
some sort of a parole deal is that.

1724
01:17:19,040 --> 01:17:19,873
That happens with a lot of guys as well.
I know guys that had to go in the army 

1725
01:17:22,341 --> 01:17:23,300
or go to jail.

1726
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:24,950
Yes,
I heard that in the navy.

1727
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:27,200
They take a lot that they used to do 
those deals a lot.

1728
01:17:27,230 --> 01:17:28,310
Yeah,
they did those deals.

1729
01:17:28,311 --> 01:17:29,720
It's Kinda good though.
I mean,

1730
01:17:29,721 --> 01:17:32,200
when you think about it,
I would choose military over.

1731
01:17:32,750 --> 01:17:33,710
Yeah,
go put me in the boat.

1732
01:17:33,711 --> 01:17:34,970
I don't know if I'm Joe.
Fuck.

1733
01:17:34,971 --> 01:17:36,110
Yeah.
Yeah.

1734
01:17:36,111 --> 01:17:36,944
I think you're right.
I think because I was in Kuwait I think 

1735
01:17:39,711 --> 01:17:41,870
and they were talking about,
you know,

1736
01:17:42,050 --> 01:17:44,600
guys coming out of active battle and 
they're,

1737
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:45,473
they're just so whacked out and I think 
that's what happens when they assault 

1738
01:17:48,111 --> 01:17:49,160
women and stuff.
They don't.

1739
01:17:49,220 --> 01:17:51,340
Who knows?
It's crazy.

1740
01:17:51,380 --> 01:17:52,213
You also have ptsd.
You also have cte which leads to 

1741
01:17:55,401 --> 01:17:58,070
impulsive behavior and cte or even know 
what that is.

1742
01:17:58,460 --> 01:18:01,190
Chronic traumatic encephalopathy in 
sample.

1743
01:18:01,200 --> 01:18:04,180
Opposite.
And how was the actual word of Patheon?

1744
01:18:04,230 --> 01:18:07,760
Cephalopathy.
It's brain damage.

1745
01:18:08,110 --> 01:18:08,943
Oh my God.
Essentially it's what football players 

1746
01:18:10,191 --> 01:18:12,260
get.
Would boxers get MMA fighters,

1747
01:18:12,261 --> 01:18:14,960
get it?
People with head injuries and one of the

1748
01:18:14,961 --> 01:18:15,794
things that is a part of that is that 
you get impulsive and you do irrational 

1749
01:18:19,071 --> 01:18:20,450
things,
thoughtless things,

1750
01:18:20,660 --> 01:18:22,430
and you almost like you can't help 
yourself.

1751
01:18:22,970 --> 01:18:23,930
And um,
they,

1752
01:18:24,020 --> 01:18:27,410
they think that it's a responsible for 
erratic changes in behavior,

1753
01:18:27,411 --> 01:18:30,050
violent behavior amongst athletes that 
have it,

1754
01:18:30,350 --> 01:18:32,660
especially football players.
You see like some of the,

1755
01:18:32,661 --> 01:18:33,494
like really aggressive,
fucked up things with football players 

1756
01:18:34,971 --> 01:18:37,730
have done.
Like they attribute some of it to cte.

1757
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:39,920
Yeah.
It's terrible.

1758
01:18:40,010 --> 01:18:40,843
We are the NFL in 1960.
Two researchers say the professional 

1759
01:18:43,191 --> 01:18:46,380
bull rider have killed himself at cte.
Oh,

1760
01:18:46,390 --> 01:18:48,070
not today because.
Yeah,

1761
01:18:48,770 --> 01:18:50,330
of course.
Of course.

1762
01:18:50,331 --> 01:18:53,260
You're writing a fucking 2000 pound 
monster animal.

1763
01:18:53,261 --> 01:18:54,830
Do you have his balls tied up in a knot?

1764
01:18:55,110 --> 01:18:55,943
Do you,
have you,

1765
01:18:55,960 --> 01:18:56,793
uh,
have you ever done like the military 

1766
01:18:58,201 --> 01:19:00,510
stuff during it in,
in an active war zone?

1767
01:19:00,630 --> 01:19:02,110
No,
it's fucking I,

1768
01:19:02,120 --> 01:19:04,370
I went to Afghanistan a few years ago,
like in.

1769
01:19:04,380 --> 01:19:07,860
Oh seven or something.
I can't do it again.

1770
01:19:07,861 --> 01:19:09,660
I was so,
it's so.

1771
01:19:09,690 --> 01:19:10,770
It's so nutty.
You're right.

1772
01:19:10,771 --> 01:19:15,450
And it's boys.
It's like 19 year old boys that are just

1773
01:19:15,451 --> 01:19:18,690
getting blown up,
stepping on IED like I go visit boys and

1774
01:19:18,870 --> 01:19:23,340
in hospitals with shrapnel in their 
faces and and the crazy part is the guys

1775
01:19:23,341 --> 01:19:24,174
that are injured,
they feel bad that they're not out 

1776
01:19:26,310 --> 01:19:27,143
fighting next to.
They're fighting with their company or 

1777
01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:30,193
whatever.
They feel guilty that they're not still 

1778
01:19:31,831 --> 01:19:32,990
out there and you're like,
oh,

1779
01:19:33,250 --> 01:19:36,520
have you ever read a Sebastian younger?
You ever read any of his stuff?

1780
01:19:37,420 --> 01:19:38,253
He's got a great book called tribe and 
it's a lot of it is about what happens 

1781
01:19:42,641 --> 01:19:47,170
to people in times of war and what 
happens to soldiers,

1782
01:19:47,950 --> 01:19:48,783
the comradery that they share together 
and that even though these harrowing 

1783
01:19:54,340 --> 01:19:57,970
death filled moments of their life,
that when they look back at it,

1784
01:19:58,150 --> 01:20:00,880
it was their favorite time of life.
Isn't that interesting?

1785
01:20:00,881 --> 01:20:04,060
Yeah,
because people apparently his.

1786
01:20:04,470 --> 01:20:08,600
I mean a lot of people believe this,
that people extreme struggled,

1787
01:20:08,601 --> 01:20:13,601
don't find meaning in life and that the 
dull gray cubicle life stuck in traffic,

1788
01:20:16,200 --> 01:20:18,450
eating fast food,
watching TV,

1789
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:21,360
going to sleep by.
That is the torture.

1790
01:20:21,630 --> 01:20:22,463
That's the torturous existence,
not the existence of of battle and the 

1791
01:20:25,321 --> 01:20:26,154
comradery that they share when the 
soldiers are side by side fighting for 

1792
01:20:32,100 --> 01:20:34,230
their lives and and defending each 
other.

1793
01:20:34,290 --> 01:20:36,300
The comraderies incredibly intense

1794
01:20:36,410 --> 01:20:37,243
and the emotions are incredibly high.
I would imagine too that that high 

1795
01:20:40,641 --> 01:20:42,870
stakes your life is at stake,
dude,

1796
01:20:42,871 --> 01:20:45,830
and you have to take care of each other 
and that's so true.

1797
01:20:45,831 --> 01:20:48,530
There is nothing more depressing than 
the gray,

1798
01:20:48,650 --> 01:20:49,580
the grays,
the board,

1799
01:20:49,880 --> 01:20:51,800
the of Sisyphean and thing like they're 
pull up,

1800
01:20:51,801 --> 01:20:53,970
push the rock up,
and then the rock come like that.

1801
01:20:54,300 --> 01:20:55,970
Zach elevator music.
Yeah,

1802
01:20:56,180 --> 01:20:57,560
that's absolutely true.

1803
01:20:58,110 --> 01:21:00,660
The drone,
the drone of and nothing existence.

1804
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:01,633
It's just.
I mean that is what most people sell 

1805
01:21:03,511 --> 01:21:04,344
their time for the.
They sell their eight hours everyday 

1806
01:21:07,410 --> 01:21:08,243
plus commuting to the drone time.
Just droning on and there are a lot of 

1807
01:21:12,271 --> 01:21:13,104
people.
A lot of those people are listening to 

1808
01:21:13,681 --> 01:21:18,590
this right now and one of the things 
about podcasts that's amazing for,

1809
01:21:18,620 --> 01:21:22,530
for that is like people get a chance to 
hear the way other people live and think

1810
01:21:22,590 --> 01:21:24,660
and then realize like there is a way 
out.

1811
01:21:24,661 --> 01:21:25,494
I am alive,
I'm alive and my brain is working and I 

1812
01:21:27,931 --> 01:21:31,470
can think and even though I'm stuck here
because I have to pay my bills,

1813
01:21:31,800 --> 01:21:32,633
this is not permanent.
I need to figure out my exit strategy 

1814
01:21:34,651 --> 01:21:38,310
and I need to start moving on it now and
they start doing that and that that's,

1815
01:21:38,350 --> 01:21:41,100
that's a,
that's a huge factor in people's futures

1816
01:21:41,220 --> 01:21:43,920
to hear the fact that other people have 
been stuck.

1817
01:21:44,290 --> 01:21:44,620
I'm,
no,

1818
01:21:44,620 --> 01:21:46,740
you have been stuck.
He was ducking shit job.

1819
01:21:47,320 --> 01:21:48,980
Yeah,
I mean I fucking did it.

1820
01:21:48,981 --> 01:21:52,340
I had 22 jobs in four years when I 
graduated from college.

1821
01:21:52,370 --> 01:21:53,203
Yeah.
I had a fucking philosophy degree and 

1822
01:21:54,771 --> 01:21:55,604
that was totally useless and I tried 
everything before I became a standard 

1823
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:00,890
training.
You name it dude.

1824
01:22:01,280 --> 01:22:03,410
Dog Walker.
Parking attendant,

1825
01:22:03,980 --> 01:22:07,250
a production assistant.
I worked in a cannery.

1826
01:22:07,670 --> 01:22:09,650
I've done it.
I like cannery.

1827
01:22:09,740 --> 01:22:12,530
The cannery in Chatsworth.
I worked in a cannery.

1828
01:22:12,660 --> 01:22:15,260
Lillian cans like these cans here?
Yeah,

1829
01:22:15,261 --> 01:22:16,094
like Laverne and Shirley were to the 
beer thing whenever I worked in a 

1830
01:22:17,691 --> 01:22:18,410
cannery.
Very,

1831
01:22:18,410 --> 01:22:22,010
very short drop because I wanted to know
what the world was about.

1832
01:22:22,011 --> 01:22:24,570
I didn't know what the world was about 
and I didn't know that I.

1833
01:22:24,580 --> 01:22:26,960
I just didn't fit in anywhere.
I was a paralegal.

1834
01:22:26,990 --> 01:22:30,320
I was an immigration paralegal,
corporate paralegal like I,

1835
01:22:30,321 --> 01:22:33,260
and at the time you didn't need to have 
any kind of like accreditation.

1836
01:22:33,260 --> 01:22:34,093
You just had to have an attorney say 
that you were and so I just learned it 

1837
01:22:36,920 --> 01:22:38,210
was fucking crazy.
Yeah.

1838
01:22:38,250 --> 01:22:40,880
Prenup attorney says,
Yup,

1839
01:22:41,090 --> 01:22:41,923
here's your stamp.
You can be an immigration paralegal 

1840
01:22:43,430 --> 01:22:46,250
because I worked long enough now.
Right now.

1841
01:22:46,251 --> 01:22:48,110
Now you need to get a certain occasion.
Yeah.

1842
01:22:48,740 --> 01:22:49,790
I'm A.
I'm a minister.

1843
01:22:50,090 --> 01:22:52,490
You are.
I'm an ordained minister.

1844
01:22:52,550 --> 01:22:55,550
Congratulations.
That's phenomenal.

1845
01:22:55,580 --> 01:22:56,810
I did it online.
He did.

1846
01:22:56,811 --> 01:22:58,430
How long did it take?
Five minutes.

1847
01:22:58,490 --> 01:23:00,200
Training yet?
There was no training.

1848
01:23:00,260 --> 01:23:00,711
Yeah,
no,

1849
01:23:00,711 --> 01:23:03,680
of course.
I just an ascendance of money.

1850
01:23:03,710 --> 01:23:06,700
I don't remember long ago.
I'm married some people though.

1851
01:23:07,060 --> 01:23:07,900
You did?
Yeah.

1852
01:23:07,980 --> 01:23:11,110
Married these two people.
That one fear factor really nice.

1853
01:23:11,111 --> 01:23:13,390
Couple married them.
It's nice of you to do.

1854
01:23:13,420 --> 01:23:15,430
People ask us to marry them and we're 
like,

1855
01:23:15,431 --> 01:23:18,910
I don't know that I do it again.
Since then I'm like,

1856
01:23:18,911 --> 01:23:19,744
nope.
I'm wanting to know and I think they're 

1857
01:23:20,561 --> 01:23:22,540
still together so that's good.

1858
01:23:22,550 --> 01:23:27,160
Worked out bitch,
but as an addendum to what you were just

1859
01:23:27,161 --> 01:23:27,994
saying about that cubicle life,
that gray life and I don't know if this 

1860
01:23:30,401 --> 01:23:34,900
is a function of like turning 40 for me,
but I've had this thing lately where I'm

1861
01:23:34,901 --> 01:23:39,901
really acutely aware of my death.
Like I've always been very existential,

1862
01:23:40,060 --> 01:23:44,770
like I've always loved thinking about my
death because it frees me to be alive,

1863
01:23:45,480 --> 01:23:47,620
but now at 40 1:41
and I'm like,

1864
01:23:48,060 --> 01:23:49,880
well I feel like I'm knocking on death's
door.

1865
01:23:49,881 --> 01:23:50,714
I like,
I get this weird thing of like it's so 

1866
01:23:52,661 --> 01:23:54,790
short,
like you don't really have a lot of time

1867
01:23:54,791 --> 01:23:58,090
on this planet and it's really weighing 
on me now more.

1868
01:23:58,091 --> 01:24:00,180
Especially now that I have a child and 
I'm like,

1869
01:24:00,200 --> 01:24:03,550
I just want to stay alive to see my son 
grow up.

1870
01:24:03,551 --> 01:24:04,384
But then you realize like,
how much of your life are you going to 

1871
01:24:05,621 --> 01:24:06,454
fucking piss away doing shit you don't 
want to do working in the fucking 

1872
01:24:10,301 --> 01:24:12,660
cubicle job you don't want to have like 
you don't.

1873
01:24:12,670 --> 01:24:14,350
You don't get many years.
Do you want me to eat?

1874
01:24:14,351 --> 01:24:16,020
You don't get many great years,
right?

1875
01:24:16,330 --> 01:24:19,240
When is your body starts to really take 
a shit like 70

1876
01:24:20,190 --> 01:24:22,110
when you're 70,
you're fucking rough.

1877
01:24:22,200 --> 01:24:25,050
Seventies.
A rough thing like you have a lot of bad

1878
01:24:25,051 --> 01:24:26,160
days.
I would imagine.

1879
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:27,833
I think one of the big keys,
and this is very hard for people to 

1880
01:24:29,821 --> 01:24:34,821
imagine that don't enjoy exercise is 
exercise is not an option.

1881
01:24:35,040 --> 01:24:38,610
It's a necessity.
It's a necessity for body maintenance.

1882
01:24:38,611 --> 01:24:39,720
So all these people go,
oh,

1883
01:24:39,960 --> 01:24:41,720
I don't want to work out.
Oh Shit.

1884
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:42,593
No.
I just,

1885
01:24:42,630 --> 01:24:46,230
I'd rather just eat whatever I want and 
live I live and you know,

1886
01:24:46,231 --> 01:24:48,780
roll the dice and be fine.
No,

1887
01:24:49,470 --> 01:24:50,303
it doesn't.
You don't just have a heart attack and 

1888
01:24:51,570 --> 01:24:52,403
die.
You slowly rot away and then your body 

1889
01:24:55,771 --> 01:24:56,780
gives out.
Yeah.

1890
01:24:56,970 --> 01:25:01,430
Like it's not a quick and easy process.
It's not like you and you,

1891
01:25:01,480 --> 01:25:04,380
you the quality of your time is not the 
same.

1892
01:25:04,790 --> 01:25:09,790
The quality of your time with exercise 
is far superior than the quality of your

1893
01:25:09,931 --> 01:25:13,050
time without exercise because you're,
you're more relaxed.

1894
01:25:13,860 --> 01:25:17,550
He body functions better,
you're stronger,

1895
01:25:17,580 --> 01:25:19,230
you can do things,
you know,

1896
01:25:19,231 --> 01:25:21,480
you don't have to be helped in so many 
ways.

1897
01:25:21,481 --> 01:25:23,760
Like there's a lot of people that can't 
even open up a jar of pickles.

1898
01:25:24,030 --> 01:25:24,863
You know,
there's like,

1899
01:25:24,900 --> 01:25:28,140
their body is just not good.
It's not working good.

1900
01:25:28,650 --> 01:25:29,340
You know,
that's.

1901
01:25:29,340 --> 01:25:30,173
You don't want to be that person.
I'm not saying you should be a 

1902
01:25:31,561 --> 01:25:33,900
bodybuilder or these should have a six 
pack.

1903
01:25:33,901 --> 01:25:34,734
You don't have to do that,
but you should devote a certain amount 

1904
01:25:36,721 --> 01:25:39,810
of time per week for body maintenance 
and you'll feel better.

1905
01:25:39,811 --> 01:25:41,670
It'll give you better decision making 
abilities.

1906
01:25:41,671 --> 01:25:42,091
You'll,
you'll,

1907
01:25:42,091 --> 01:25:43,680
you'll,
you'll be calmer.

1908
01:25:43,681 --> 01:25:44,514
You'll be more removed from the stress 
of the everyday grind because your 

1909
01:25:47,161 --> 01:25:51,270
body's experiencing some stress,
some workload.

1910
01:25:51,510 --> 01:25:53,850
And by doing that and putting out that 
energy,

1911
01:25:53,851 --> 01:25:54,684
it frees you.

1912
01:25:54,760 --> 01:25:55,593
Oh my gosh,
can I just tell you that I've met so 

1913
01:25:56,891 --> 01:25:58,920
many people on the road,
um,

1914
01:25:59,460 --> 01:26:02,320
who come up to me and say,
please tell Joe Rogan,

1915
01:26:02,321 --> 01:26:03,154
thank you.
Because I lost 100 pounds because I've 

1916
01:26:05,151 --> 01:26:06,860
been listening to him.
I lost 50 pounds.

1917
01:26:06,861 --> 01:26:09,260
I started exercising because I've been 
listening to Joe and Dah,

1918
01:26:09,261 --> 01:26:09,470
Dah,
Dah,

1919
01:26:09,470 --> 01:26:10,303
so just know that people totally 
listened to neal and totally have 

1920
01:26:12,921 --> 01:26:15,500
changed our lives.
A lot of responsibility,

1921
01:26:17,180 --> 01:26:18,590
but uh,
but yeah,

1922
01:26:18,620 --> 01:26:19,453
I don't fucking like polities I hate it,
but to anybody listening that hates it 

1923
01:26:22,881 --> 01:26:23,714
the way I do than pay somebody,
pay somebody who holds you accountable 

1924
01:26:26,750 --> 01:26:28,940
and then you have to fucking show up and
they,

1925
01:26:28,970 --> 01:26:29,960
they make you do it.

1926
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:33,030
Just don't just go and pay somebody.
You know what?

1927
01:26:33,031 --> 01:26:34,590
And here's the thing,
when people who don't have any money,

1928
01:26:35,570 --> 01:26:37,830
if you can listen to this podcast,
it means you have a computer,

1929
01:26:38,100 --> 01:26:38,933
right?
Hopefully if you have a computer or if 

1930
01:26:40,801 --> 01:26:41,634
you have a phone,
if you have a regular iphone or 

1931
01:26:42,961 --> 01:26:46,890
something like that,
you can go on youtube and you could play

1932
01:26:47,550 --> 01:26:49,290
a yoga class.
There's a ton of them.

1933
01:26:50,010 --> 01:26:52,200
You don't need to pay to pay.
I mean,

1934
01:26:52,350 --> 01:26:55,260
hot yoga I think is better because it's 
like more strain in your body.

1935
01:26:55,261 --> 01:26:56,940
But guess what?
Regular Yoga is fine.

1936
01:26:57,210 --> 01:26:58,680
It's fucking great for,
you know,

1937
01:26:58,730 --> 01:26:59,670
Youtube.
Yeah.

1938
01:26:59,740 --> 01:27:02,640
It's all in all.
Also for bodyweight exercises.

1939
01:27:02,641 --> 01:27:05,040
I tell people that when they want to 
know kettlebell exercises,

1940
01:27:05,041 --> 01:27:05,874
like yeah,
if you can afford to have someone teach 

1941
01:27:07,801 --> 01:27:09,270
you how to do it correctly,
that's good,

1942
01:27:09,300 --> 01:27:12,660
but you can learn everything you want to
learn on youtube.

1943
01:27:13,060 --> 01:27:14,980
It's not amazing.
It's incredible.

1944
01:27:15,550 --> 01:27:18,790
Unclogged drain one time from Youtube,
from Youtube.

1945
01:27:18,970 --> 01:27:19,803
I was like,
we didn't have any money and the battle 

1946
01:27:21,131 --> 01:27:24,490
was full and fucked up and I was like,
I'm not going to pay some fucking guy to

1947
01:27:24,491 --> 01:27:26,980
come here and just snake this thing and 
then that's it.

1948
01:27:27,010 --> 01:27:28,870
And I learned how to do it.
I went down to the hardware store,

1949
01:27:29,110 --> 01:27:30,150
got the thing,
but to do it,

1950
01:27:30,180 --> 01:27:32,790
but if it got one of those,
once I got one of them power snakes,

1951
01:27:34,260 --> 01:27:37,870
that's great.
Fucking snake the shit out of my,

1952
01:27:38,530 --> 01:27:42,870
my watch my dogs in the shower and it 
was just caked up with hair.

1953
01:27:42,871 --> 01:27:44,430
It was ridiculous.
I had just like,

1954
01:27:44,431 --> 01:27:45,264
Hey,
our Pi.

1955
01:27:45,470 --> 01:27:48,990
But like I would pull it out of the 
drain like these big wads.

1956
01:27:49,170 --> 01:27:50,600
Especially Brutus.
My,

1957
01:27:50,601 --> 01:27:52,070
um,
my Shiba Inu,

1958
01:27:52,170 --> 01:27:56,160
I'm a English bulldog mix.
He's got a lot of hair.

1959
01:27:56,430 --> 01:27:58,080
And when I would watch him in the 
shower,

1960
01:27:58,081 --> 01:28:02,250
I would pull these hunks and Marshall's 
the worst though the goldens that worse.

1961
01:28:02,440 --> 01:28:06,030
You pull these giant chunks,
people's hair logged everything up.

1962
01:28:06,240 --> 01:28:07,073
So I just got one of them.
Snakes shoved it in there and it 

1963
01:28:11,730 --> 01:28:14,760
follows.
It's weighed down and cleans it all out.

1964
01:28:14,761 --> 01:28:18,300
And then the water flushes don't pump 
that drain.

1965
01:28:18,320 --> 01:28:19,320
Oh shit down there though.

1966
01:28:19,610 --> 01:28:21,080
That eats away your pipes,
right?

1967
01:28:21,090 --> 01:28:21,923
It's not good.
You know what I was thinking I should 

1968
01:28:23,161 --> 01:28:26,990
have fucking become like a plumber or an
electrician while I was doing standup in

1969
01:28:26,991 --> 01:28:27,824
the beginning,
like as a day job because I for when 

1970
01:28:29,741 --> 01:28:30,574
some shit happens at your house and you 
got to call that asshole and they come 

1971
01:28:32,361 --> 01:28:33,890
out,
they have all the power.

1972
01:28:34,130 --> 01:28:34,963
The guy who knows how to just fix your 
plumbing or your electricity is not a 

1973
01:28:37,971 --> 01:28:39,050
small job.
It's not easy.

1974
01:28:39,051 --> 01:28:39,884
I'm not saying that.
But the guy that knows how to do that 

1975
01:28:41,541 --> 01:28:44,900
has all the power in that situation.
And you're so vulnerable,

1976
01:28:44,901 --> 01:28:45,734
you know,
and your lights don't work or the thing 

1977
01:28:46,890 --> 01:28:48,650
and you're like,
Oh,

1978
01:28:48,651 --> 01:28:50,450
you have the knowledge of the power to 
do this,

1979
01:28:50,451 --> 01:28:51,284
please help me.
So you think you should've become a 

1980
01:28:52,491 --> 01:28:56,450
plumber just to learn it so that you can
do for yourself or to do it as a Gig.

1981
01:28:56,480 --> 01:28:58,770
That should've been my daytime job.
But if you do that as a Gig,

1982
01:28:58,860 --> 01:29:00,910
that's not an easy gig to get.
It's not easy.

1983
01:29:00,920 --> 01:29:02,070
You to have an apprenticeship.

1984
01:29:02,310 --> 01:29:07,310
You learn how to deal with the union has
a lot of shit involved and you know what

1985
01:29:09,380 --> 01:29:12,350
skill it is.
But it's also super long hours.

1986
01:29:12,380 --> 01:29:15,210
Like you're working,
you're working hard like plumbers work,

1987
01:29:15,260 --> 01:29:17,010
you know.
But it's the long hours.

1988
01:29:17,040 --> 01:29:19,170
I was hoping I could make my own hours a
bit more.

1989
01:29:19,380 --> 01:29:20,213
Well,
and the good thing about something like 

1990
01:29:20,851 --> 01:29:22,590
that though is you would have your 
nights free.

1991
01:29:22,830 --> 01:29:24,540
That's what I'm talking about.
You'd be so tired.

1992
01:29:25,320 --> 01:29:28,260
You need a lazy day job.
That's what I found for standup.

1993
01:29:28,261 --> 01:29:31,080
It was the best just to have like a nine
to five that I didn't give a shit about.

1994
01:29:31,290 --> 01:29:33,140
Didn't have to expend too much energy.
What was your.

1995
01:29:33,190 --> 01:29:34,023
What would your nine to five job that 
you were when you first started making 

1996
01:29:36,211 --> 01:29:38,390
it first started working?
Well,

1997
01:29:38,410 --> 01:29:41,460
the best job I ever had was at the girl 
scouts of Greater Los Angeles.

1998
01:29:42,660 --> 01:29:43,493
That's the fucking fun.
As John was part time and I would like 

1999
01:29:46,950 --> 01:29:47,783
help the girl scout cookie drive sale.
I would answer phones and I was on 

2000
01:29:51,601 --> 01:29:52,434
Chelsea lately at the same time,
so I would go to the round table and 

2001
01:29:55,501 --> 01:29:57,930
then go work at the girl scouts like the
next day.

2002
01:29:57,990 --> 01:29:58,980
That's crazy.
Yeah,

2003
01:29:58,981 --> 01:30:00,360
it was fun.
It was fun though.

2004
01:30:00,361 --> 01:30:04,410
It was like an easy paycheck.
Let girls in the cub scouts now?

2005
01:30:05,880 --> 01:30:06,713
Yes.
Now is it vice versa to the cub scouts 

2006
01:30:09,271 --> 01:30:12,000
are going to join the girl scouts.
I don't think any boys are going to sign

2007
01:30:12,001 --> 01:30:13,810
up for the law.
Why?

2008
01:30:13,860 --> 01:30:15,270
How dare you?
How Binary?

2009
01:30:16,170 --> 01:30:21,170
Super Binary about my son.
Uh Oh.

2010
01:30:21,630 --> 01:30:23,250
We're.
We're so binary in our house.

2011
01:30:23,251 --> 01:30:26,520
We just bought my son a football,
a football book.

2012
01:30:26,521 --> 01:30:29,500
It's in the shape of a football and 
explains football to the boy.

2013
01:30:29,501 --> 01:30:30,270
You should do that.

2014
01:30:30,270 --> 01:30:31,103
And right next to it,
put a little dress and see which one to 

2015
01:30:32,311 --> 01:30:33,260
choose.
I can't.

2016
01:30:33,300 --> 01:30:35,430
I fucking tell you right now.
When he chooses.

2017
01:30:35,820 --> 01:30:36,653
It's so.
It's so funny now that I have a son and 

2018
01:30:38,491 --> 01:30:40,080
I'm like,
this is the kid likes dirt.

2019
01:30:40,230 --> 01:30:44,550
He's playing in the trash can right now.
All that stuff.

2020
01:30:44,551 --> 01:30:45,740
Cars,
dirt,

2021
01:30:46,380 --> 01:30:49,230
muck.
He's 100 percent heterosexual.

2022
01:30:50,140 --> 01:30:53,020
He might be just like a super bare.
Yeah,

2023
01:30:53,030 --> 01:30:54,620
that'd be great.
And muffled bear.

2024
01:30:54,630 --> 01:30:55,463
I like that character because if he's.
Tommy's boy's going to be hairy as fuck 

2025
01:30:59,221 --> 01:31:00,880
Harry.
And you'd do it a wolf.

2026
01:31:02,750 --> 01:31:05,640
Imagine if he's a little baby and he 
starts growing back here.

2027
01:31:05,641 --> 01:31:06,200
You're like,
oh,

2028
01:31:06,200 --> 01:31:07,033
you're a baby.
What the fuck has jamie wants to babies 

2029
01:31:11,461 --> 01:31:12,294
with back here?
There's got to be like some Iranian 

2030
01:31:14,341 --> 01:31:15,360
wrestler,
baby,

2031
01:31:18,190 --> 01:31:20,810
Iranian,
Russian man.

2032
01:31:20,811 --> 01:31:23,820
Lead little baby with fucking thick back
here.

2033
01:31:24,090 --> 01:31:24,923
It's hilarious.
Like what is the youngest ever child 

2034
01:31:26,941 --> 01:31:27,630
that had been?
Okay,

2035
01:31:27,630 --> 01:31:30,270
there's got to be some weird genetic 
thing.

2036
01:31:30,271 --> 01:31:31,960
Like hirsutism.
Yeah.

2037
01:31:31,961 --> 01:31:35,040
Here you go.
Go Harry fucking baby.

2038
01:31:35,400 --> 01:31:37,940
Jesus Christ is that babies pass.
Ever clean.

2039
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:43,230
The hairiest baby ass ever.
That's incredible baby.

2040
01:31:43,280 --> 01:31:44,113
A kid's got no shot,
literally going to live with your 

2041
01:31:45,660 --> 01:31:46,493
werewolf.
Oh,

2042
01:31:46,860 --> 01:31:50,370
look at that Harry fucking baby.
That's the same.

2043
01:31:50,690 --> 01:31:53,730
That baby's entire back is covered in 
hair care.

2044
01:31:53,800 --> 01:31:56,820
That's a kid's going to be a savage.
I bet he's built like Wolverine.

2045
01:31:56,821 --> 01:31:59,070
Yeah.
It's probably like seven.

2046
01:31:59,290 --> 01:32:03,990
Just shacked pig traps and shit.
Giant shoulders covered with a for.

2047
01:32:07,500 --> 01:32:08,333
Yeah.
We took my son to some baby heavy 

2048
01:32:10,240 --> 01:32:11,110
classes,
you know,

2049
01:32:11,130 --> 01:32:11,963
and they teach whatever they say shit.
Like we're stimulating his frontal lobe 

2050
01:32:16,211 --> 01:32:19,630
right now.
Right.

2051
01:32:20,270 --> 01:32:21,103
He's bouncing balls.
It's called bouncing the fucking ball 

2052
01:32:23,290 --> 01:32:24,123
and then she brings out a box of dolls 
and there's girls and boys in the class 

2053
01:32:27,490 --> 01:32:29,890
and my son is like night and interested.
That shit.

2054
01:32:29,891 --> 01:32:33,160
Like he just totally doesn't want it.
And then she tells me,

2055
01:32:33,430 --> 01:32:34,263
you know,
we should teach him to like adults too 

2056
01:32:36,971 --> 01:32:38,500
and also be sensitive.
And I'm like,

2057
01:32:38,501 --> 01:32:40,000
don't worry about it.
Yeah.

2058
01:32:40,210 --> 01:32:42,400
First of all,
my kids not interested.

2059
01:32:42,401 --> 01:32:44,440
He's not going to lie.
I'm not gonna force him to play.

2060
01:32:44,650 --> 01:32:46,090
Secondly,
he knows how to be gentle.

2061
01:32:46,091 --> 01:32:48,010
We have dogs in the house.
He,

2062
01:32:48,070 --> 01:32:50,980
he learns to be.
He's not a stupid idiot kid like,

2063
01:32:50,981 --> 01:32:52,690
you know,
but the forcing of it,

2064
01:32:52,691 --> 01:32:53,430
I was like,
all right,

2065
01:32:53,430 --> 01:32:54,760
well we know fucking whatever.

2066
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,580
Not Weird that someone,
first of all the,

2067
01:32:57,610 --> 01:32:58,443
the idea that you would know what a 
child should play with at two and you 

2068
01:33:03,731 --> 01:33:05,500
this person who doesn't even know the 
kid.

2069
01:33:05,710 --> 01:33:07,840
Right.
And does she have babies of her own?

2070
01:33:07,990 --> 01:33:08,940
I don't know.
Eh,

2071
01:33:09,260 --> 01:33:10,093
I probably should know that too.
So this is like theoretical shit that 

2072
01:33:14,531 --> 01:33:15,364
she's trying to apply to a living human 
in some sort of experimental way and 

2073
01:33:18,820 --> 01:33:21,130
teaching it as dogma.
Yes,

2074
01:33:21,400 --> 01:33:22,233
I know.
And it's always the bitches that don't 

2075
01:33:23,321 --> 01:33:24,154
have kids,
so it's always a weird fucking macrame 

2076
01:33:26,261 --> 01:33:31,261
bitches.
I smelled like petroleum fucking incense

2077
01:33:32,490 --> 01:33:35,440
and they drive Prius's.
It's so great.

2078
01:33:35,441 --> 01:33:36,800
Bumper stickers.
Oh,

2079
01:33:36,801 --> 01:33:38,770
that's cute.
They're choking those babies,

2080
01:33:38,771 --> 01:33:42,580
baby spawn Australia babies get massages
and stuff.

2081
01:33:42,640 --> 01:33:43,630
Oh,
that's Kinda cool.

2082
01:33:43,800 --> 01:33:45,030
Kid smiling,
you know,

2083
01:33:45,031 --> 01:33:47,590
it's really creepy baby chiropractors 
that.

2084
01:33:48,290 --> 01:33:49,123
Yeah,
they take their babies to chiropractors 

2085
01:33:50,111 --> 01:33:51,460
and the chiropractors adjust them.

2086
01:33:51,910 --> 01:33:52,743
I was like,
yeah,

2087
01:33:52,990 --> 01:33:55,810
cracked her next newborn babies.
Not enough money in the world.

2088
01:33:55,811 --> 01:33:59,140
Out of their fucking mind.
Yeah.

2089
01:34:00,250 --> 01:34:01,083
I would never do it fucking sick.
How do you even find a school for your 

2090
01:34:03,671 --> 01:34:07,590
chiropractic for you?
Get can help with colic,

2091
01:34:07,680 --> 01:34:09,910
earaches reflux,
asthma,

2092
01:34:10,360 --> 01:34:12,220
allergies,
sleep problems,

2093
01:34:12,280 --> 01:34:16,330
adhd and bed wedding,
and it makes them psychic.

2094
01:34:16,760 --> 01:34:19,630
You can see the future.
They read your mind,

2095
01:34:19,631 --> 01:34:22,000
shut the fuck up.
It doesn't do any of those things.

2096
01:34:22,001 --> 01:34:24,310
You fucking assholes.
Baby.

2097
01:34:24,320 --> 01:34:29,320
Crack and cons that that is the one of 
the creepiest fucking things and this is

2098
01:34:29,681 --> 01:34:32,050
the other thing to have the best 
possible start.

2099
01:34:32,051 --> 01:34:34,840
Everything is marketed that if you don't
do this for your child,

2100
01:34:35,020 --> 01:34:37,900
they're going to be developmentally 
behind every other asshole.

2101
01:34:38,090 --> 01:34:38,923
Well,
I have to tell you,

2102
01:34:38,950 --> 01:34:41,140
I've known the human race now for 41 
years.

2103
01:34:41,260 --> 01:34:42,093
I'm not fucking impressed and I'm not 
worried that my kid is behind all these 

2104
01:34:45,821 --> 01:34:49,090
assholes because most people aren't 
really doing much anyway,

2105
01:34:49,091 --> 01:34:51,190
so I'm not so worried about getting 
ahead.

2106
01:34:51,250 --> 01:34:53,090
He's fine by cracking his neck.
Yeah.

2107
01:34:53,140 --> 01:34:56,410
He needs his fucking net zero evidence 
that does anything by the way,

2108
01:34:56,590 --> 01:34:57,980
zero.
I don't know

2109
01:34:57,980 --> 01:35:00,170
about it.
Do know about it unfortunately.

2110
01:35:00,171 --> 01:35:01,160
Yeah.
I went into it.

2111
01:35:01,190 --> 01:35:03,380
I had a lady on was written articles 
about it.

2112
01:35:04,030 --> 01:35:07,730
It was all invented by a guy who was a 
magnetic healer in the 18 hundreds.

2113
01:35:07,880 --> 01:35:08,713
It's one of those things.
It's grandfathered in that we'd like to 

2114
01:35:09,891 --> 01:35:12,170
think of as being legit source of 
medicine.

2115
01:35:12,420 --> 01:35:15,020
Like they call themselves.
Doctors didn't go to medical school,

2116
01:35:15,530 --> 01:35:16,363
medical school.
It's something like they put leaches on 

2117
01:35:18,591 --> 01:35:19,640
you.
Not that kind of.

2118
01:35:19,730 --> 01:35:20,563
Well,
it's just leaches might actually have a 

2119
01:35:21,531 --> 01:35:24,830
medical benefit,
but the only thing that seems to help is

2120
01:35:24,831 --> 01:35:28,550
adjusting lower back for some people,
alleviate some pain,

2121
01:35:28,730 --> 01:35:31,880
but the problem is is like some 
psychosomatic shit going on with people.

2122
01:35:32,110 --> 01:35:35,240
There's some placebo effect.
Like does that feel better?

2123
01:35:35,241 --> 01:35:37,170
Yeah,
it does.

2124
01:35:37,420 --> 01:35:39,080
I like you're looking forward to feel 
better.

2125
01:35:39,140 --> 01:35:42,320
Just being touched feels better now.
Getting a massage feels better,

2126
01:35:42,350 --> 01:35:44,390
but there's no like one,
like,

2127
01:35:44,391 --> 01:35:46,250
look,
if you go to an orthopedic surgeon,

2128
01:35:46,251 --> 01:35:47,630
you have a tear in your knee.

2129
01:35:47,630 --> 01:35:51,260
They replace your acl.
That's fucking real.

2130
01:35:51,680 --> 01:35:53,080
They really fixed.
You know,

2131
01:35:53,210 --> 01:35:54,140
if someone just takes you,
it goes,

2132
01:35:54,141 --> 01:35:55,490
okay,
relax.

2133
01:35:55,670 --> 01:35:58,950
I want you to think about your shock or 
about the sun.

2134
01:35:59,250 --> 01:36:00,180
I'm going to get.
Hold on.

2135
01:36:00,181 --> 01:36:01,014
I'm gonna.
Get it.

2136
01:36:01,070 --> 01:36:01,731
Okay.
I got it.

2137
01:36:01,731 --> 01:36:02,780
I got it.
I got it.

2138
01:36:02,781 --> 01:36:06,020
You didn't get anything get and it's 
terrifying.

2139
01:36:06,110 --> 01:36:07,850
It's terrifying to have somebody do that
to,

2140
01:36:07,851 --> 01:36:10,370
you know,
girl died last year,

2141
01:36:10,371 --> 01:36:11,204
some playboy playmate she character.
She got adjusted and she developed some 

2142
01:36:14,361 --> 01:36:16,240
sort of a blood clot and died.
Cool.

2143
01:36:16,440 --> 01:36:17,273
And in someone,
someone I talked about that and people 

2144
01:36:19,640 --> 01:36:22,220
that love chiropractors or are 
chiropractors,

2145
01:36:22,221 --> 01:36:24,170
they emailed me.
You fucking asshole.

2146
01:36:24,171 --> 01:36:26,960
You're splitting a negative shit about 
chiropractic.

2147
01:36:27,020 --> 01:36:29,630
That woman had a medical issue that she 
did not dissolve.

2148
01:36:29,900 --> 01:36:33,470
Just listened to me.
If she can get through life and not have

2149
01:36:33,471 --> 01:36:36,050
a fucking stroke until someone adjust 
her neck.

2150
01:36:36,110 --> 01:36:38,240
How the hell is adjusting your neck?
Good.

2151
01:36:39,340 --> 01:36:40,350
She had a medical issue.
What?

2152
01:36:40,351 --> 01:36:41,184
What medical issue?
She doesn't like getting her neck 

2153
01:36:43,561 --> 01:36:44,860
strangled.
Like what?

2154
01:36:44,920 --> 01:36:46,000
What is going on?
She did.

2155
01:36:46,010 --> 01:36:48,200
She bleed easy,
but she hemophiliac.

2156
01:36:48,201 --> 01:36:50,840
Like what's causing why?
Why you're doing that?

2157
01:36:50,841 --> 01:36:52,880
There's no evidence that that works.
It doesn't do anything.

2158
01:36:53,030 --> 01:36:54,680
I don't know.
I don't know shit about it.

2159
01:36:54,681 --> 01:36:56,990
I don't trust it though.
I don't let anybody fucking crack me.

2160
01:36:57,080 --> 01:36:59,210
It's crazy how,
how prominent it is.

2161
01:36:59,240 --> 01:37:00,073
It's everywhere.
We had a girl tell us when our son was 

2162
01:37:02,211 --> 01:37:05,990
eight weeks old and he was crying like 
around 5:00

2163
01:37:05,991 --> 01:37:07,940
every night.
It's like it was his witching hour.

2164
01:37:07,970 --> 01:37:10,910
Newborns often have the time of day.
They get cranky.

2165
01:37:11,600 --> 01:37:12,860
She goes,
this is our,

2166
01:37:13,040 --> 01:37:14,540
our nanny at the time.
She goes,

2167
01:37:14,541 --> 01:37:15,350
you know,
I,

2168
01:37:15,350 --> 01:37:16,183
I sent this energy is off and it might 
be because he's sensing your anxiety 

2169
01:37:20,481 --> 01:37:21,314
and.

2170
01:37:21,350 --> 01:37:23,900
Well,
I have a friend that does Reiki and um,

2171
01:37:23,960 --> 01:37:28,960
she normally charges $100 an hour,
but she'll charge you 50 because he's so

2172
01:37:29,721 --> 01:37:30,760
small.
Oh,

2173
01:37:31,160 --> 01:37:34,630
Jesus Christ.
That's when they do this thing.

2174
01:37:34,640 --> 01:37:36,870
They go near you with energy with the 
Harris.

2175
01:37:37,280 --> 01:37:40,760
Have you ever had somebody new you will 
want to blow your fucking brains out?

2176
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:43,640
I had a lady do it to me and I don't 
know what it does,

2177
01:37:43,641 --> 01:37:46,760
but they hover over you over your 
Chakra,

2178
01:37:47,030 --> 01:37:49,640
whatever the fuck that is.
And the whole time I'm like,

2179
01:37:49,641 --> 01:37:54,641
I'm so angry that this person's dealing 
because I want to try it,

2180
01:37:57,030 --> 01:37:59,400
because I had heard about it and I was 
like,

2181
01:37:59,401 --> 01:38:00,780
well,
is it like a massage?

2182
01:38:00,781 --> 01:38:04,020
I didn't really know enough.
And it's not a massage,

2183
01:38:04,021 --> 01:38:05,010
it's nothing.
Oh,

2184
01:38:05,011 --> 01:38:05,844
she doing reiki treatment session,
please give me some volume so I can 

2185
01:38:10,831 --> 01:38:13,830
understand how she's healing her vagina.
And she's hovering over a pussy.

2186
01:38:14,130 --> 01:38:15,540
She's like,
this area is hot,

2187
01:38:17,490 --> 01:38:19,500
warm.
You might have syphilis.

2188
01:38:20,010 --> 01:38:22,590
Go to a doctor.
What's up with your socks?

2189
01:38:23,430 --> 01:38:27,780
He's given up on life with those socks.
She's shutting it down.

2190
01:38:27,810 --> 01:38:30,720
Hold on.
I usually start at the bird.

2191
01:38:30,721 --> 01:38:33,210
I started at the third day.
I look at her.

2192
01:38:33,540 --> 01:38:34,530
She's super healthy.

2193
01:38:35,510 --> 01:38:39,410
Placing my hands on the client because I
don't want to press into her eyes.

2194
01:38:40,910 --> 01:38:42,650
You're not near her eyes.
Crazy bitch.

2195
01:38:42,710 --> 01:38:44,540
No,
it's her third eye.

2196
01:38:44,570 --> 01:38:47,490
Joe.
I'm sorry I'm.

2197
01:38:47,860 --> 01:38:50,200
Or approximately two to three minutes.

2198
01:38:50,520 --> 01:38:54,190
That's why it's infuriating it of this 
demo.

2199
01:38:54,850 --> 01:38:58,270
I'm just going to take you through each 
one explaining what

2200
01:38:58,830 --> 01:38:59,990
super healthy.
Looking at her.

2201
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,100
She's got a chart on the wall,
so it's got to be legit.

2202
01:39:02,920 --> 01:39:07,920
The fucking short legitimize drawn like 
a 19 sixties kung food diagram.

2203
01:39:09,450 --> 01:39:12,600
This is where the death touch is,
will push my stupid chart.

2204
01:39:12,810 --> 01:39:13,643
I had a lady cornered me at the comedy 
store and tell me the cheese or a reiki 

2205
01:39:16,531 --> 01:39:19,920
healer and she.
She made me put my hand down and I go,

2206
01:39:19,921 --> 01:39:21,120
what?
What are you going to do?

2207
01:39:21,190 --> 01:39:24,300
She's like,
I'm just to just so you can feel it,

2208
01:39:24,870 --> 01:39:26,160
and I go,
what am I feeling?

2209
01:39:26,460 --> 01:39:28,900
She was just put your hand out and just 
empty your mind like,

2210
01:39:28,950 --> 01:39:30,420
okay,
done.

2211
01:39:31,050 --> 01:39:33,810
I put my hand down and she just hovers 
their handover.

2212
01:39:33,840 --> 01:39:34,710
I go,
what are you doing?

2213
01:39:34,770 --> 01:39:36,060
And she's like,
you're not open.

2214
01:39:36,090 --> 01:39:37,440
This is not going to work if you're not 
open.

2215
01:39:37,441 --> 01:39:37,771
I'm like,
oh,

2216
01:39:37,771 --> 01:39:40,740
well it's not going to work because you 
just hovered in your hand over me.

2217
01:39:40,950 --> 01:39:42,150
She's like,
I'm a Reiki healer.

2218
01:39:42,151 --> 01:39:43,320
I might pitch.
You're crazy.

2219
01:39:43,321 --> 01:39:44,790
You're out of your fucking mind.
No,

2220
01:39:44,900 --> 01:39:46,080
she.
She's a shyster.

2221
01:39:46,081 --> 01:39:47,330
These are hucksters.
Yeah,

2222
01:39:47,650 --> 01:39:48,483
they believe.
I don't know if they believe some of 

2223
01:39:50,191 --> 01:39:51,960
them,
but I don't want to generalize them into

2224
01:39:51,961 --> 01:39:52,794
one giant group,
but some of them must believe they're 

2225
01:39:54,721 --> 01:39:55,950
doing something.
Well.

2226
01:39:55,951 --> 01:39:58,100
I think you have to believe it's working
too.

2227
01:39:58,120 --> 01:39:59,360
It's that CBF.
Yes,

2228
01:39:59,430 --> 01:40:00,590
exactly.
I mean,

2229
01:40:00,600 --> 01:40:01,433
look,
I've been hypnotized to stop smoking 

2230
01:40:02,551 --> 01:40:04,870
cigarettes and it's been a lead on 
stairs.

2231
01:40:05,130 --> 01:40:06,110
That's different,
but yeah,

2232
01:40:06,140 --> 01:40:08,130
completely.
Yeah,

2233
01:40:08,131 --> 01:40:09,850
but he knows this is legit.
Yeah,

2234
01:40:09,990 --> 01:40:11,780
and I think that's what I've been.
I've talked to.

2235
01:40:11,790 --> 01:40:15,450
I'm going to see if you agree with this.
I think that's what standup is.

2236
01:40:16,020 --> 01:40:19,050
I think when you're killing,
like say if I'm watching you,

2237
01:40:19,051 --> 01:40:21,120
if you're onstage and you're killing it,
I'm sitting in the back of the room.

2238
01:40:21,150 --> 01:40:23,940
I'm letting you think for me.
I'm like caught in your trance,

2239
01:40:24,240 --> 01:40:25,200
right?
You're like,

2240
01:40:25,980 --> 01:40:28,400
I'm not not thinking,
oh,

2241
01:40:28,401 --> 01:40:31,050
I don't know if I agree with her.
Maybe she's wrong.

2242
01:40:31,650 --> 01:40:34,530
Don't let her dress.
I'm sitting there and I'm allow.

2243
01:40:34,560 --> 01:40:38,040
If you're killing and I'm locked into 
you and I'm really enjoying the show,

2244
01:40:38,250 --> 01:40:39,083
I'm allowing you to think for me and I'm
falling into this trance in sort of a 

2245
01:40:43,501 --> 01:40:46,020
way and when and when you're making me 
laugh,

2246
01:40:46,050 --> 01:40:47,740
then like I,
uh,

2247
01:40:47,750 --> 01:40:52,080
I have confidence in your thought 
process that I'll let you take the reins

2248
01:40:52,081 --> 01:40:53,650
and I'll just sit back and have a good 
time.

2249
01:40:53,920 --> 01:40:54,040
I

2250
01:40:54,040 --> 01:40:58,450
think there's something to that because 
I was hypnotized for the first time last

2251
01:40:58,450 --> 01:41:00,760
year by a friend of mine.
His name is vinny shoreman and he does a

2252
01:41:00,761 --> 01:41:02,380
lot of work.
He's a hypnotist,

2253
01:41:02,590 --> 01:41:03,423
but he also does a lot of work with 
fighters and he puts them in this state 

2254
01:41:06,071 --> 01:41:06,904
and it's,
you're entirely conscious while this is 

2255
01:41:08,341 --> 01:41:11,200
happening,
but he puts you in this very,

2256
01:41:11,201 --> 01:41:16,201
very relaxed state and you go over 
things that you would like to work on or

2257
01:41:16,811 --> 01:41:18,970
go over.
Things that perhaps are bothering you.

2258
01:41:19,240 --> 01:41:21,280
Go over things that are bothering you 
about the past.

2259
01:41:21,490 --> 01:41:22,323
But what it is is about putting you in a
state of mind where you can just relax 

2260
01:41:26,861 --> 01:41:31,861
and think and not be overwhelmed by 
extraneous information or things outside

2261
01:41:32,171 --> 01:41:34,170
of your control that's real.
That's,

2262
01:41:34,290 --> 01:41:36,660
that's like as real as meditation is 
real.

2263
01:41:36,970 --> 01:41:37,590
But this shit

2264
01:41:37,590 --> 01:41:41,130
where I'm going to hover over your 
vagina and pretend I'm cooking.

2265
01:41:42,330 --> 01:41:43,650
Here I am.
The energy.

2266
01:41:43,710 --> 01:41:46,500
You're not open Joe.
You're just not open to it.

2267
01:41:46,530 --> 01:41:47,363
If my hand was a marshmallow right now 
and for a bit because I'm roasting over 

2268
01:41:50,581 --> 01:41:55,581
your pussy.
She recovered her everything.

2269
01:41:56,660 --> 01:41:59,460
When she got to the vagina,
she stayed there for a long time.

2270
01:41:59,610 --> 01:42:00,660
She was like,
this is.

2271
01:42:00,950 --> 01:42:05,550
This is the area of your travels.
This is where it all stems here.

2272
01:42:05,580 --> 01:42:08,970
Plus the heat coming out of your hands 
are sweaty.

2273
01:42:08,971 --> 01:42:13,971
Smell them stupid.
It just.

2274
01:42:14,800 --> 01:42:17,680
But people always want to find like 
there's something wrong with me.

2275
01:42:17,681 --> 01:42:19,900
I have anxiety.
I'm living in traffic.

2276
01:42:19,901 --> 01:42:22,000
I don't like my life.
Someone fix me.

2277
01:42:22,410 --> 01:42:24,970
I'm going to put needles in your head 
and all over the place.

2278
01:42:25,040 --> 01:42:29,240
That's a bunch of dog shit too.
Have you done acupuncture?

2279
01:42:29,870 --> 01:42:31,280
Well aligns too.
And I hated it.

2280
01:42:31,281 --> 01:42:34,940
I was so angry the whole time.
It hurts.

2281
01:42:35,030 --> 01:42:36,950
It fucking hurts.
It hurt for me.

2282
01:42:36,951 --> 01:42:37,581
It did.
I met.

2283
01:42:37,581 --> 01:42:41,000
Maybe she was doing it wrong.
I was having migraines.

2284
01:42:41,110 --> 01:42:42,530
Oh,
like 10 years ago.

2285
01:42:42,531 --> 01:42:45,080
But it's because I was on this birth 
control pill that was fucking with me.

2286
01:42:45,110 --> 01:42:45,560
Oh No,
no,

2287
01:42:45,560 --> 01:42:47,330
no.
It's because you didn't get the needles.

2288
01:42:47,450 --> 01:42:49,980
You know why it wasn't open enough to 
the Reiki.

2289
01:42:51,020 --> 01:42:54,770
Maybe if you just Reiki the fist right 
in there.

2290
01:42:57,410 --> 01:43:00,620
Now go ahead and make a fist.
Put it in your ass.

2291
01:43:01,160 --> 01:43:06,160
Feel the energy massager in her colon.

2292
01:43:07,930 --> 01:43:08,763
Yeah.

2293
01:43:09,510 --> 01:43:13,230
I only did it once and it was a guy who 
was a chiropractor too.

2294
01:43:13,290 --> 01:43:14,123
So you had double bullshit going on.
He adjusted my neck and then he stuck 

2295
01:43:17,581 --> 01:43:20,070
needles in my head and he was trying to 
fix my shoulder and I'm like,

2296
01:43:21,300 --> 01:43:23,520
how'd that go?
Turned out.

2297
01:43:23,540 --> 01:43:26,190
It was just a little slight little 
muscle poll that I needed to get over.

2298
01:43:26,340 --> 01:43:27,173
Now.
What do you think about psychics and 

2299
01:43:28,951 --> 01:43:31,350
mediums?
Bullshit artists.

2300
01:43:31,700 --> 01:43:34,500
Yeah.
I think I go with.

2301
01:43:35,010 --> 01:43:35,843
I think it is entirely possible that we 
sense things that we don't have an 

2302
01:43:40,621 --> 01:43:43,680
understanding of.
Like sometimes you feel something weird.

2303
01:43:43,681 --> 01:43:44,514
Like I was thinking about a friend of 
mine yesterday and I hadn't talked to 

2304
01:43:46,801 --> 01:43:48,960
him in awhile and he emailed me out of 
the blue.

2305
01:43:49,010 --> 01:43:51,060
Right.
I don't know if that's coincidence.

2306
01:43:51,560 --> 01:43:54,440
I don't know what that is,
but the odds of it happening.

2307
01:43:56,760 --> 01:43:57,593
You got to think of how many times do 
you think about your friend and they 

2308
01:43:59,361 --> 01:44:00,610
don't email you.
Right?

2309
01:44:01,010 --> 01:44:04,340
Right.
Like why is it then when you think about

2310
01:44:04,341 --> 01:44:06,570
them and they do?
Is it just going?

2311
01:44:06,650 --> 01:44:07,483
I don't know,
but I think there are times where you 

2312
01:44:09,891 --> 01:44:12,830
sense things that you don't have a sense
for.

2313
01:44:13,100 --> 01:44:17,580
Like there's a feeling that you get.
Well you don't understand and I think we

2314
01:44:17,690 --> 01:44:18,523
sent things about each other and maybe 
their social cues that we're picking up 

2315
01:44:21,711 --> 01:44:22,544
on.
Maybe there's maybe people give off 

2316
01:44:23,661 --> 01:44:24,494
pheromones when they're upset me and 
maybe those trigger you because we were 

2317
01:44:27,620 --> 01:44:30,710
sort of designed to avoid confrontation 
and certain individuals,

2318
01:44:31,310 --> 01:44:32,143
but I think this idea that they can look
at you and like your family is from a 

2319
01:44:38,301 --> 01:44:39,830
sense of farm.
Desert

2320
01:44:39,950 --> 01:44:44,950
farm is your farm farming your plants,
so implants know what it is.

2321
01:44:45,081 --> 01:44:48,160
Is a potted plant sit by those?
Yes.

2322
01:44:49,560 --> 01:44:54,520
And you are close to a woman.
Who would that be a mother?

2323
01:44:54,521 --> 01:44:55,820
And My mother was a woman.
Mother.

2324
01:44:55,821 --> 01:44:57,230
Yes.
Yes.

2325
01:44:57,680 --> 01:44:59,660
I see your mother.
Um,

2326
01:44:59,720 --> 01:45:02,360
I'm trying to picture out her name.
Is there an a in her name?

2327
01:45:03,580 --> 01:45:07,150
Magdalen man.
Dude.

2328
01:45:07,170 --> 01:45:09,350
I went to see this lady.
She knew everything about my mom.

2329
01:45:09,590 --> 01:45:12,310
A friend of mine went to a chiropractor 
and the chiropractor,

2330
01:45:12,320 --> 01:45:16,010
a psych exam,
shit and same shit.

2331
01:45:16,011 --> 01:45:18,480
Different toilet.
He went to the chiropractor.

2332
01:45:18,481 --> 01:45:20,260
He knew all about my grandmother.
I go,

2333
01:45:20,310 --> 01:45:22,320
yeah,
don't you know about your grandmother?

2334
01:45:23,600 --> 01:45:24,250
You Know

2335
01:45:24,250 --> 01:45:24,821
Grandmother,
right?

2336
01:45:24,821 --> 01:45:25,654
So your chiropractor telling you shit 
you already know or you're psychic 

2337
01:45:27,581 --> 01:45:28,414
rather still killing the chiropractor.
Reiki healer knows shit about things 

2338
01:45:32,831 --> 01:45:33,664
that you already know.
So they're telling you things you 

2339
01:45:34,871 --> 01:45:35,704
already know,
like they're not psychic manipulating 

2340
01:45:37,570 --> 01:45:39,080
you,
they're putting questions out there,

2341
01:45:39,100 --> 01:45:41,650
getting answers,
they've given you leading questions,

2342
01:45:41,651 --> 01:45:42,484
you're answering them in a very naive 
way and you're giving them the 

2343
01:45:45,041 --> 01:45:46,810
information because they're fucking con 
artist.

2344
01:45:47,080 --> 01:45:47,913
Tell us asshole to tell you what your 
future is telling me to tell you what 

2345
01:45:50,480 --> 01:45:53,200
the lottery number is.
How come they never picked the lottery?

2346
01:45:53,201 --> 01:45:54,260
These fucks.
Right?

2347
01:45:54,440 --> 01:45:55,273
And Houdini had this thing where it 
didn't he work it out with his wife or 

2348
01:45:58,691 --> 01:46:00,880
something.
There's like a code word so that when he

2349
01:46:00,881 --> 01:46:01,714
died he would go from beyond have the 
word that they would know and it never 

2350
01:46:05,650 --> 01:46:06,910
happened.
Maybe it didn't like her.

2351
01:46:07,450 --> 01:46:10,050
Fuck that bitch.
Like I'm assets faction known rebecca.

2352
01:46:10,720 --> 01:46:14,320
I go by Penn and teller.
I'm friends with Penn and love him.

2353
01:46:14,321 --> 01:46:17,140
He just tells me it's 100 percent 
horseshit.

2354
01:46:17,290 --> 01:46:19,900
Yeah,
like 100 percent flat out.

2355
01:46:20,080 --> 01:46:22,090
You know they have that James Randy 
challenge.

2356
01:46:22,360 --> 01:46:24,520
You know,
that guy is offered a million dollars to

2357
01:46:24,521 --> 01:46:26,950
anyone that can prove actual psychic 
powers.

2358
01:46:27,040 --> 01:46:30,160
No one's taken them up on it and no 
one's ever James.

2359
01:46:30,161 --> 01:46:32,410
Randy.
That's the James Randy challenge.

2360
01:46:33,450 --> 01:46:38,450
What's the Long Island medium?
I think she might be a bullshit artist.

2361
01:46:40,210 --> 01:46:42,700
I one time I think I got hosed.
I did a show,

2362
01:46:42,701 --> 01:46:44,320
a podcast,
and the lady was.

2363
01:46:44,680 --> 01:46:45,513
She was good because I think.
I think what it is is people can read 

2364
01:46:47,531 --> 01:46:49,830
your unconscious.
It's one unconscious reading,

2365
01:46:49,831 --> 01:46:51,600
another unconscious mind.
I imagine.

2366
01:46:52,050 --> 01:46:55,530
I feel like your father was an organist.
Am I right?

2367
01:46:56,050 --> 01:46:57,420
Yes,
but that's the thing.

2368
01:46:57,421 --> 01:46:59,370
They're telling you things that you 
already know.

2369
01:46:59,590 --> 01:47:00,423
That's what drives me.
Fucking what's already a belief or 

2370
01:47:03,181 --> 01:47:06,420
whatever in you versus new information.
What do you think about astrologers?

2371
01:47:07,060 --> 01:47:08,980
It's fucking stupid shit.
Right?

2372
01:47:09,500 --> 01:47:11,220
Shannon,
can I tell you something?

2373
01:47:11,221 --> 01:47:14,430
Whenever I meet a girl and she's like,
what's your sign?

2374
01:47:14,431 --> 01:47:15,061
And I'm like,
Jim.

2375
01:47:15,061 --> 01:47:16,530
And I just like,
I knew it.

2376
01:47:16,740 --> 01:47:18,900
You're such a jam and I what's your 
husband?

2377
01:47:18,901 --> 01:47:20,290
And I'm like,
don't please don't like,

2378
01:47:20,310 --> 01:47:24,210
I can't pretend like I can't.
I can't subscribe to.

2379
01:47:27,100 --> 01:47:29,610
How can you not believe you're such a 
Scorpio?

2380
01:47:32,560 --> 01:47:33,393
It's silly when you can find traits in 
people and all sorts of people that 

2381
01:47:36,871 --> 01:47:39,840
match all sorts of different.
Like I could be a virgo.

2382
01:47:40,450 --> 01:47:41,283
Taurus.
Yeah.

2383
01:47:41,740 --> 01:47:42,750
Oh,
you're so stubborn.

2384
01:47:42,751 --> 01:47:46,110
You're got towards Pisces.
That when such a Leo,

2385
01:47:46,111 --> 01:47:48,030
how could you not believe you're such a 
Leo?

2386
01:47:48,840 --> 01:47:50,040
Yeah,
because I could read any,

2387
01:47:50,100 --> 01:47:53,100
any horoscope,
and it would probably apply.

2388
01:47:53,520 --> 01:47:55,710
Well,
what I really wonder about.

2389
01:47:55,740 --> 01:47:56,730
Well,
those are bullshit.

2390
01:47:56,980 --> 01:47:57,813
The real horoscope thing,
when you talk to the people that are 

2391
01:48:00,271 --> 01:48:02,190
super into it,
they.

2392
01:48:02,460 --> 01:48:06,570
They literally want to know what time of
the day you were born,

2393
01:48:06,571 --> 01:48:10,500
what part of the world you were born,
and then they're like,

2394
01:48:10,501 --> 01:48:12,340
well,
you're a Gemini with a cancer ride.

2395
01:48:13,440 --> 01:48:14,273
Park.
Cut.

2396
01:48:14,410 --> 01:48:16,520
Stop.
It makes my asshole pucker.

2397
01:48:16,670 --> 01:48:17,503
Like even hearing it,
it's like a million alarm bells are 

2398
01:48:20,371 --> 01:48:20,881
like,
dum,

2399
01:48:20,881 --> 01:48:21,511
dum,
dum,

2400
01:48:21,511 --> 01:48:21,900
dum.

2401
01:48:21,900 --> 01:48:23,360
I can't.
I can only go.

2402
01:48:24,250 --> 01:48:26,620
Stan.
Hope you still get to the coast.

2403
01:48:26,700 --> 01:48:28,350
We have a funny bit about how ridiculous
it is.

2404
01:48:28,800 --> 01:48:30,360
It's just,
it's fun.

2405
01:48:30,800 --> 01:48:31,660
It's fun,
but it's,

2406
01:48:31,661 --> 01:48:33,390
it's silly.
We're searching.

2407
01:48:33,510 --> 01:48:35,370
People are always searching for meaning.
You know?

2408
01:48:35,371 --> 01:48:36,204
We're always searching for someone who 
knows something that we don't hidden 

2409
01:48:38,311 --> 01:48:39,144
knowledge.
The secrets to the universe because 

2410
01:48:40,141 --> 01:48:40,974
there's so much uncertainty that leaves 
open the possibility that someone has 

2411
01:48:43,870 --> 01:48:45,210
like,
I've been gifted,

2412
01:48:45,211 --> 01:48:46,830
I have a gift,
and you're like,

2413
01:48:46,831 --> 01:48:47,641
yes,
great.

2414
01:48:47,641 --> 01:48:50,020
Tell me.
I went to a psychic once.

2415
01:48:50,630 --> 01:48:53,220
I went to an audition in New York and I 
was just like,

2416
01:48:53,230 --> 01:48:56,530
what am I doing with my life?
Walking to the train station.

2417
01:48:56,531 --> 01:48:59,250
I'm going to go to a psychic.
So I went to the psychic and she's like,

2418
01:49:00,450 --> 01:49:01,540
you have a brother?
No,

2419
01:49:01,580 --> 01:49:06,580
I don't have a psychic brother.
I feel like maybe you have a brother you

2420
01:49:06,931 --> 01:49:07,510
don't know about.

2421
01:49:07,510 --> 01:49:08,690
No,
no.

2422
01:49:09,120 --> 01:49:13,470
My mom had me when she was 20.
I have a sister shut the fuck up and she

2423
01:49:13,471 --> 01:49:15,510
made up a bunch of stupid shit and she 
was talking about,

2424
01:49:15,810 --> 01:49:19,620
you're not sure what you want to do with
your life.

2425
01:49:19,621 --> 01:49:20,371
I go,
no,

2426
01:49:20,371 --> 01:49:21,990
I know exactly what I want to do.
Yeah,

2427
01:49:22,310 --> 01:49:24,390
I think what?
This is terrible.

2428
01:49:24,930 --> 01:49:27,780
You don't know what you're doing.
I had a lady just tell me right before I

2429
01:49:27,781 --> 01:49:29,490
shot my specialist psychic.
She goes,

2430
01:49:30,180 --> 01:49:31,740
I go,
what do you see in my future?

2431
01:49:31,980 --> 01:49:32,813
And I knew that the special was coming 
and she didn't even know that I did for 

2432
01:49:35,371 --> 01:49:36,270
a living.
And she goes,

2433
01:49:36,570 --> 01:49:37,403
I see you as like an interior designer.
Just guessing you have a real flair for 

2434
01:49:44,071 --> 01:49:44,610
style.
I got.

2435
01:49:44,610 --> 01:49:47,470
I certainly do not.
This is the last thing I'm good at.

2436
01:49:47,471 --> 01:49:48,100
And where two different

2437
01:49:48,100 --> 01:49:49,540
colored socks.
Bitch look at me.

2438
01:49:49,541 --> 01:49:51,760
I'm an animal.
Like I don't know what I'm doing.

2439
01:49:52,570 --> 01:49:54,730
Crazy lady.
Why did you go see her?

2440
01:49:54,940 --> 01:49:56,950
Because there's a podcast.
It was a friend's podcast,

2441
01:49:56,951 --> 01:49:59,620
which they have mediums on and I thought
it'll be,

2442
01:49:59,710 --> 01:50:01,270
it'll be silly.
It'll be fun.

2443
01:50:01,750 --> 01:50:02,660
And you know,
I,

2444
01:50:02,661 --> 01:50:04,450
I got,
I got suckered in that day.

2445
01:50:04,451 --> 01:50:06,190
I think I did.
I really did.

2446
01:50:06,210 --> 01:50:09,840
I know if I'm being honest because my 
mother died two years ago so I was Kinda

2447
01:50:09,850 --> 01:50:10,970
like.
And,

2448
01:50:11,110 --> 01:50:12,550
and I,
now that I looking back,

2449
01:50:12,551 --> 01:50:13,384
she did totally lead me down.
Like your mother was kind of nutty 

2450
01:50:16,691 --> 01:50:17,980
though.
My mother was mentally ill.

2451
01:50:18,040 --> 01:50:19,420
Yeah.
Like legit,

2452
01:50:19,450 --> 01:50:23,590
like she was a borderline personality 
disorder and then had schizophrenia too.

2453
01:50:23,591 --> 01:50:27,850
So it was fucking whackadoodles.
Do you have to do like self audits?

2454
01:50:28,860 --> 01:50:31,350
You mean aggressive therapy for the last
decade or so?

2455
01:50:32,420 --> 01:50:34,440
Do you look into your own brand?

2456
01:50:34,440 --> 01:50:36,730
Go and my wacky 24 slash seven.
Yeah.

2457
01:50:37,120 --> 01:50:38,440
Well that 20 percent more,
uh,

2458
01:50:38,570 --> 01:50:39,760
but I,
because I was,

2459
01:50:40,420 --> 01:50:41,253
I grew up alone with my mom,
my parents split and then I was raised 

2460
01:50:43,571 --> 01:50:48,571
by a crazy person and so I've had to 
like relearn how to think and what's,

2461
01:50:49,430 --> 01:50:50,940
what's the right way to do stuff and 
that,

2462
01:50:50,950 --> 01:50:51,783
like I said,
I've been in therapy for a decade so 

2463
01:50:52,841 --> 01:50:54,400
I've had to learn,
you know,

2464
01:50:54,670 --> 01:50:56,770
like I just had to relearn and it's 
totally.

2465
01:50:56,830 --> 01:50:58,510
You totally can,
you know,

2466
01:50:58,511 --> 01:51:00,160
that's the thing.
Like I and I just want to talk.

2467
01:51:00,161 --> 01:51:01,900
I don't talk about it to be like,
oh poor me,

2468
01:51:01,901 --> 01:51:04,420
I had this thing but just didn't let 
people know.

2469
01:51:04,421 --> 01:51:07,750
If you did grow up kind of Wacky,
you can fucking fix your brain.

2470
01:51:07,810 --> 01:51:09,070
You can reorient,
you can,

2471
01:51:09,100 --> 01:51:12,160
you can change how you think.
He doesn't have to stay sick,

2472
01:51:12,270 --> 01:51:13,103
you know?

2473
01:51:13,160 --> 01:51:14,830
Um,
how often do you go to therapy?

2474
01:51:14,890 --> 01:51:15,820
Every week,
dude.

2475
01:51:15,821 --> 01:51:18,250
And if I don't like I feel it.
Like I started,

2476
01:51:18,640 --> 01:51:21,280
I got to have a whole regimen.
It's the exercise,

2477
01:51:21,340 --> 01:51:23,710
it's the therapy.
It's eating,

2478
01:51:23,711 --> 01:51:24,880
right?
It's sleeping,

2479
01:51:25,030 --> 01:51:27,310
it's got to do it all.
Otherwise,

2480
01:51:27,550 --> 01:51:28,430
I mean,
I,

2481
01:51:28,480 --> 01:51:30,820
I get out of whack.
And what do you get out of the therapy?

2482
01:51:31,370 --> 01:51:32,203
Uh,
so I,

2483
01:51:32,230 --> 01:51:33,063
I believe in psychotherapy,
like getting back Friday and I like to 

2484
01:51:36,761 --> 01:51:39,280
go back to the initial wound to the root
cause.

2485
01:51:39,970 --> 01:51:41,850
I like to go back,
look,

2486
01:51:41,920 --> 01:51:44,440
because what happens is you get wounded 
way back when,

2487
01:51:44,470 --> 01:51:46,540
right at the childhood trauma,
the thing,

2488
01:51:46,570 --> 01:51:47,403
and then you grow up and it gets 
triggered by whatever stuff happens as 

2489
01:51:50,111 --> 01:51:50,944
an adult.
Except now you're all fired up and 

2490
01:51:52,211 --> 01:51:54,760
you're all angry and you're so 
overreacted and you don't know why.

2491
01:51:54,790 --> 01:51:55,623
Well,
it's probably not because of what 

2492
01:51:55,751 --> 01:51:56,320
happened today.

2493
01:51:56,320 --> 01:51:59,920
It's what happened back here.
So if you resolve the ship back here,

2494
01:51:59,950 --> 01:52:02,920
then what happens today becomes a lot 
clearer and it works for me.

2495
01:52:03,010 --> 01:52:04,510
So it makes sense,
right?

2496
01:52:04,511 --> 01:52:06,340
And don't think about what's going on 
right now.

2497
01:52:06,370 --> 01:52:08,750
Think about why you feel weird about 
what's going on right now.

2498
01:52:08,800 --> 01:52:09,633
What is it really?
Did my husband really just look at me 

2499
01:52:11,351 --> 01:52:12,184
funny and that's why I'm so furious 
about this little thing or is this 

2500
01:52:15,911 --> 01:52:19,030
something that's Mommy Daddy way back 
here?

2501
01:52:19,080 --> 01:52:19,913
Yeah,
because I think a lot of us live from 

2502
01:52:21,401 --> 01:52:23,350
the past.
You live from the past wound.

2503
01:52:23,590 --> 01:52:27,880
You make all your decisions based on on 
that programming,

2504
01:52:27,881 --> 01:52:28,714
so if you're fucking wires are crossed,
you're going to make bad decisions over 

2505
01:52:31,091 --> 01:52:31,924
and over and over again.
I would imagine that anytime spent 

2506
01:52:34,270 --> 01:52:38,890
thinking about your behavior,
thinking about the way you think,

2507
01:52:39,220 --> 01:52:43,760
just examining your own mind is as long 
as you're really doing it justice.

2508
01:52:43,761 --> 01:52:46,160
So really being like so many people 
don't

2509
01:52:46,160 --> 01:52:47,700
ever think about the way they think.
No,

2510
01:52:47,930 --> 01:52:50,630
they're just caught up in the whirlwind 
of life,

2511
01:52:50,810 --> 01:52:54,200
the momentum of their own existence and 
the next thing you know,

2512
01:52:54,201 --> 01:52:56,900
they're like miserable and 50 and like,
what am I doing?

2513
01:52:56,901 --> 01:52:58,090
Where am I?
Where am I?

2514
01:52:58,820 --> 01:52:59,653
Right?
Or it's the divorce and remarriage to 

2515
01:53:02,991 --> 01:53:05,150
someone who's going to be better.
It's going to fix it.

2516
01:53:05,180 --> 01:53:07,790
He's going to fix it and he's my.
He's my soul mate.

2517
01:53:08,300 --> 01:53:09,500
I'm going to get.
I'm going to have an affair.

2518
01:53:09,590 --> 01:53:11,010
I'm going to do that.
I'm going to ask out here.

2519
01:53:11,750 --> 01:53:16,250
How's that gonna work for you?
I'm going to start doing drugs,

2520
01:53:16,251 --> 01:53:17,990
alcohol overheating,
whatever.

2521
01:53:18,020 --> 01:53:19,910
Gambling,
compulsive.

2522
01:53:20,060 --> 01:53:21,710
That'll.
That'll clear up this stuff,

2523
01:53:21,711 --> 01:53:22,700
right?
The gambling,

2524
01:53:22,701 --> 01:53:23,534
one of the weirdest one to me.
So many people that are compulsive 

2525
01:53:26,181 --> 01:53:29,180
gamblers and I see the itch and them to 
get that itch.

2526
01:53:29,690 --> 01:53:31,070
I'm so scared to gambling.

2527
01:53:33,200 --> 01:53:35,390
You go to Vegas.
I don't,

2528
01:53:35,450 --> 01:53:36,770
I don't,
I don't like it.

2529
01:53:36,771 --> 01:53:38,780
I know it's not from your work there.
I have.

2530
01:53:38,781 --> 01:53:39,614
Yeah,
yeah,

2531
01:53:39,660 --> 01:53:41,030
yeah.
I worked there a lot.

2532
01:53:41,230 --> 01:53:42,063
You know,
I worked there like three or four times 

2533
01:53:43,971 --> 01:53:44,804
a year,
you know,

2534
01:53:45,110 --> 01:53:50,110
for the UFC and uh,
I now spend zero time and casinos,

2535
01:53:50,940 --> 01:53:51,773
but I used to spend time because he 
knows because I would stay in a casino 

2536
01:53:54,201 --> 01:53:55,034
and then I would work in a casino,
but now I just stay outside of the 

2537
01:53:57,771 --> 01:54:01,250
casino because it's just,
I don't enjoy being around that energy.

2538
01:54:01,280 --> 01:54:04,160
I agree.
There's this frantic gambler energy.

2539
01:54:04,161 --> 01:54:04,994
We see these people.
You walk by the card tables and they're 

2540
01:54:06,291 --> 01:54:07,970
just looking and they're like,
whoa.

2541
01:54:07,971 --> 01:54:09,950
You're like watching people in an opium 
den.

2542
01:54:10,530 --> 01:54:11,890
Yes.
Yeah,

2543
01:54:11,900 --> 01:54:13,730
it's depravity.
It's low energy,

2544
01:54:13,731 --> 01:54:16,700
low frequency.
There's the lightest synthetic,

2545
01:54:16,701 --> 01:54:18,920
the synthetic,
the time stops,

2546
01:54:18,950 --> 01:54:20,300
the I don't like that.

2547
01:54:20,660 --> 01:54:21,493
And you know,
it's what I figured out too is that 

2548
01:54:22,491 --> 01:54:24,590
everyone's got the shit,
the addictions,

2549
01:54:24,591 --> 01:54:25,424
the gambling,
the compulsive behaviors because we're 

2550
01:54:27,441 --> 01:54:30,320
afraid to feel the feeling.
You're just afraid of the feeling,

2551
01:54:30,360 --> 01:54:31,193
the that.
But I think it's also there is a reward 

2552
01:54:34,551 --> 01:54:37,010
to winning and you're chasing this 
reward constantly.

2553
01:54:37,011 --> 01:54:37,844
I don't necessarily know if it's a being
afraid of the feeling as much as being 

2554
01:54:41,361 --> 01:54:42,900
addicted to the reward.
You know?

2555
01:54:42,920 --> 01:54:45,140
That's the two.
Like I was reading this article that the

2556
01:54:45,141 --> 01:54:48,290
guy who created likes on facebook was 
saying that,

2557
01:54:48,291 --> 01:54:50,300
you know,
not only does he not use facebook,

2558
01:54:50,301 --> 01:54:54,020
now that he's got like a thing set up on
his computer where he can't go to reddit

2559
01:54:54,410 --> 01:54:57,560
and his phone is set up or you can't 
download apps.

2560
01:54:57,860 --> 01:54:58,693
Like he doesn't like.
He's like that whole like thing where 

2561
01:55:01,391 --> 01:55:04,270
you go to check to see how many likes 
you got on a facebook post.

2562
01:55:04,270 --> 01:55:05,900
You may or something like that.
Like that.

2563
01:55:05,901 --> 01:55:10,310
Reward system is entirely,
it's addictive and it triggers this,

2564
01:55:10,340 --> 01:55:14,090
this thing in people and that it can 
hijack your mind.

2565
01:55:14,150 --> 01:55:17,810
I mean that was like literally like the 
title of the article is that like,

2566
01:55:17,811 --> 01:55:18,644
uh,
this technology can hijack your mind 

2567
01:55:20,270 --> 01:55:22,910
without question at the reward system.
Right?

2568
01:55:22,911 --> 01:55:24,080
Like little rats.
Ding,

2569
01:55:24,081 --> 01:55:24,441
Ding,
Ding.

2570
01:55:24,441 --> 01:55:25,720
I got the cheese.
The cheese.

2571
01:55:25,800 --> 01:55:27,640
There's mosquitoes.
People in front of the slots.

2572
01:55:27,641 --> 01:55:30,120
Yeah.
Yeah.

2573
01:55:30,140 --> 01:55:32,090
It feels good.
Just droned out.

2574
01:55:32,540 --> 01:55:34,220
But then when you're in the reward 
system,

2575
01:55:34,221 --> 01:55:35,054
you're not thinking about the stuff 
that's bothering you and everything's 

2576
01:55:37,921 --> 01:55:40,280
great.
Love me,

2577
01:55:40,281 --> 01:55:40,881
Daddy.
Good,

2578
01:55:40,881 --> 01:55:41,391
good,
good.

2579
01:55:41,391 --> 01:55:43,920
I did think about that.
Gambling is a weird one,

2580
01:55:43,921 --> 01:55:44,580
man.
Yeah.

2581
01:55:44,580 --> 01:55:47,340
I don't understand it because you're 
really self sabotaging.

2582
01:55:47,480 --> 01:55:48,540
Who?
Gambles of a storm.

2583
01:55:50,980 --> 01:55:52,290
I've heard this.
Yes.

2584
01:55:52,620 --> 01:55:53,670
Mania.
Yes.

2585
01:55:53,730 --> 01:55:58,730
Hundreds of thousands of dollars a night
mania that I did not know.

2586
01:55:59,340 --> 01:56:01,650
Savage,
savage,

2587
01:56:01,720 --> 01:56:06,720
cannibal or what's the motive?
There was a big fan.

2588
01:56:11,270 --> 01:56:13,380
I loved it.
I loved him by the way.

2589
01:56:13,381 --> 01:56:15,720
As a child.
I think so,

2590
01:56:15,750 --> 01:56:18,330
so funny.
I love being friends with them.

2591
01:56:18,390 --> 01:56:19,223
I love them.
I'm friends with dice is the coolest 

2592
01:56:21,640 --> 01:56:23,640
person on the phone.
Joseph,

2593
01:56:24,300 --> 01:56:25,260
Talk to me,
I love him,

2594
01:56:25,590 --> 01:56:28,110
but it's um,
he loves the thrill of gambling,

2595
01:56:28,300 --> 01:56:30,650
so I don't know,
but what is the thrill?

2596
01:56:30,840 --> 01:56:32,820
The way I avoid gambling altogether?
I'm,

2597
01:56:32,850 --> 01:56:35,130
I'm far too frugal,
but is it the,

2598
01:56:35,131 --> 01:56:38,610
is it the thing of like I can lose 
everything?

2599
01:56:38,790 --> 01:56:40,260
There's a little of that.
There's a,

2600
01:56:40,261 --> 01:56:43,120
there's a rush of winning too.
It's not just the,

2601
01:56:43,840 --> 01:56:44,673
the,
the notion that you could lose 

2602
01:56:45,541 --> 01:56:46,830
everything.
It's the rush of winning.

2603
01:56:47,090 --> 01:56:49,440
Wow.
Dana White's a giant gambler.

2604
01:56:49,590 --> 01:56:50,670
He's,
he's gambled.

2605
01:56:50,700 --> 01:56:52,830
He's lost as much as a million dollars 
per night.

2606
01:56:53,040 --> 01:56:56,130
Is this as the circle as a surf board or
a president of the UFC?

2607
01:56:56,220 --> 01:56:57,053
Oh,
sorry.

2608
01:56:57,830 --> 01:56:59,090
Is he a band?
Uca.

2609
01:56:59,290 --> 01:57:01,960
Dana white boy band member.
I'm thinking of.

2610
01:57:01,961 --> 01:57:02,794
It's Shaun white boy.
You know what I've been getting into 

2611
01:57:04,831 --> 01:57:05,920
lately?
Um,

2612
01:57:06,130 --> 01:57:08,760
breakdancers,
I fucking love breakdancing.

2613
01:57:08,880 --> 01:57:10,410
I love that whole.
I love that era.

2614
01:57:10,500 --> 01:57:13,530
There's a instagram page called stance 
elements.

2615
01:57:13,550 --> 01:57:15,450
Okay.
Holy Shit.

2616
01:57:15,720 --> 01:57:18,260
These guys are on another level.
Yeah,

2617
01:57:18,400 --> 01:57:20,700
there's this,
a young Korean kid.

2618
01:57:21,150 --> 01:57:24,480
The shit that he does like defies 
physics.

2619
01:57:24,810 --> 01:57:28,740
I think that column like pocket Kim or 
something like that is his name.

2620
01:57:28,890 --> 01:57:31,080
He's on that stance.
Elements page.

2621
01:57:31,640 --> 01:57:32,473
Dude,
there's this school you can go to and 

2622
01:57:33,451 --> 01:57:35,590
learn.
I don't want to try mine.

2623
01:57:36,920 --> 01:57:38,370
I'm having a hard enough time with 
English.

2624
01:57:38,371 --> 01:57:39,570
That's the guy.
Yeah.

2625
01:57:39,571 --> 01:57:41,040
What is the name?
Bobby pocket.

2626
01:57:41,430 --> 01:57:42,900
Pocket pocket.
Okay.

2627
01:57:43,910 --> 01:57:46,980
Go to his watch this guy like this guy.
But no,

2628
01:57:46,981 --> 01:57:49,280
you can't believe the shit he can do.
Look at this.

2629
01:57:50,170 --> 01:57:52,530
Look at this dude.
Seriously,

2630
01:57:52,650 --> 01:57:57,450
what in the fuck this come on.
I mean,

2631
01:57:58,230 --> 01:57:59,063
what in the fuck?
This guy is on such another level than 

2632
01:58:03,781 --> 01:58:04,614
anything I've ever seen before.
He's taken this to some completely new 

2633
01:58:08,011 --> 01:58:10,290
place.
So Rad dude.

2634
01:58:10,410 --> 01:58:13,180
He was on.
Was looking at Tim Ferriss,

2635
01:58:13,181 --> 01:58:15,350
his instagram page blank.
Tim Ferriss.

2636
01:58:16,970 --> 01:58:18,000
Yeah.
And this was on it.

2637
01:58:18,001 --> 01:58:20,460
This guy was on it and I was like,
what in the fuck?

2638
01:58:20,461 --> 01:58:24,330
And then I started following stance 
elements on instagram.

2639
01:58:25,170 --> 01:58:27,720
Once I started following on Instagram,
I realized like,

2640
01:58:27,750 --> 01:58:30,090
Oh my God,
I had no idea this was even happening.

2641
01:58:30,390 --> 01:58:32,280
Like there's,
it's girls too.

2642
01:58:32,460 --> 01:58:33,293
There's a bunch of girls.
Scroll down and see some of the girls 

2643
01:58:35,130 --> 01:58:35,970
like you see,
like La,

2644
01:58:36,030 --> 01:58:39,330
there was a girl with long hair with a 
hat on to keep scrolling down.

2645
01:58:39,810 --> 01:58:40,643
Just keep scrolling down.
There was girl on the dance floor type 

2646
01:58:43,991 --> 01:58:46,330
situation with long hair and a hat.
Like,

2647
01:58:46,420 --> 01:58:47,470
keep going.
You'll find her.

2648
01:58:47,500 --> 01:58:48,010
Keep going.
No,

2649
01:58:48,010 --> 01:58:48,730
no,
no.

2650
01:58:48,730 --> 01:58:50,840
That might be one of them.
That's probably.

2651
01:58:50,890 --> 01:58:51,551
Yeah,
that's one of them.

2652
01:58:51,551 --> 01:58:53,290
Watch this girl shit.
There's a bunch of them,

2653
01:58:54,770 --> 01:58:58,390
but these girls can do crazy shit too,
like are unbelievable athletes.

2654
01:58:58,391 --> 01:58:59,590
So give me some music there Jamie.

2655
01:59:02,410 --> 01:59:06,280
But it's like.
It's a crazy like gymnastics,

2656
01:59:06,370 --> 01:59:11,370
rhythmic gymnastics art form thing like.
So they do the dance thing where they're

2657
01:59:13,501 --> 01:59:15,630
standing up and then they get down on 
the ground.

2658
01:59:15,920 --> 01:59:19,170
It's so hard to imagine doing this shit 
now.

2659
01:59:19,250 --> 01:59:20,083
No,
but what's really interesting is a lot 

2660
01:59:21,721 --> 01:59:22,554
of these people that get into Jujitsu 
are particularly talented at Jujitsu 

2661
01:59:27,420 --> 01:59:30,090
because they have some amazing control 
over their body.

2662
01:59:30,510 --> 01:59:33,630
One of our best students from 10th 
Planet Jujitsu's,

2663
01:59:33,920 --> 01:59:35,240
the Geo Martinez

2664
01:59:35,240 --> 01:59:36,073
and Richie Martinez,
his two brothers and they're both 

2665
01:59:38,390 --> 01:59:39,223
breakdancers.
They started out break dancing and now 

2666
01:59:41,001 --> 01:59:41,834
they're fucking savage Jujitsu fighters 
and one of the reasons why is because 

2667
01:59:45,441 --> 01:59:47,660
they have this incredible control of 
their body and that pant,

2668
01:59:48,360 --> 01:59:49,210
but I'm,
I'm fasting.

2669
01:59:49,211 --> 01:59:50,300
I go to that every day.
I'm like,

2670
01:59:50,301 --> 01:59:53,990
what's the new freak shit?
You find your instagram jams,

2671
01:59:53,991 --> 01:59:54,360
right?
Oh,

2672
01:59:54,360 --> 01:59:56,440
you have a lot of jams on instagram.
What's your other jam?

2673
01:59:56,441 --> 01:59:57,920
Let's go.
Oh boy.

2674
01:59:57,980 --> 02:00:00,230
I don't know.
I follow a lot of nature pages.

2675
02:00:00,530 --> 02:00:01,363
Oh,
nature.

2676
02:00:02,230 --> 02:00:04,520
Yeah.
Nature is metal is one of my favorite.

2677
02:00:04,610 --> 02:00:06,290
Cool.
Have you been in nature as metal?

2678
02:00:07,430 --> 02:00:10,250
Horrific.
Fucking animals killing each other.

2679
02:00:11,030 --> 02:00:13,490
You do like that because you always do 
post shit.

2680
02:00:13,491 --> 02:00:16,190
Like,
look at this fucking beast and it's some

2681
02:00:16,191 --> 02:00:17,600
crazy animal.
Yeah.

2682
02:00:17,601 --> 02:00:19,070
I got to tell everybody,
look at that one.

2683
02:00:20,300 --> 02:00:22,370
These walls fighting over a deer that 
they've killed.

2684
02:00:22,580 --> 02:00:24,440
That's bananas.
The covenant blood.

2685
02:00:24,790 --> 02:00:27,590
Um,
there's one that's going on right now.

2686
02:00:28,040 --> 02:00:28,873
It's not visual,
but it's a story on my friend Remy 

2687
02:00:31,370 --> 02:00:32,203
Warren on his instagram page.
They were on an island in Alaska and 

2688
02:00:36,621 --> 02:00:39,170
they got attacked by a giant grizzly 
bear,

2689
02:00:39,740 --> 02:00:43,520
a giant Kodiak Brown bears.
A thousand pound bear knocked him over,

2690
02:00:43,700 --> 02:00:44,533
ran through the camp.
One guy was literally riding on the 

2691
02:00:46,761 --> 02:00:48,820
bears back as it ran down the hill,
the little,

2692
02:00:48,830 --> 02:00:49,663
the bear literally attacked and there 
was so many people and everybody 

2693
02:00:51,820 --> 02:00:53,870
scattered in certain directions and 
nobody got killed,

2694
02:00:54,050 --> 02:00:58,550
but they easily could have gotten killed
and it's on his instagram page.

2695
02:00:58,551 --> 02:01:01,160
There's that video,
but there's also an instagram story.

2696
02:01:01,161 --> 02:01:03,470
If you using the APP and you click on 
this little icon,

2697
02:01:04,160 --> 02:01:07,690
it's like one of those where you see 
like 100 dots in a row and he broke it.

2698
02:01:07,700 --> 02:01:08,533
I don't know how he did it.

2699
02:01:08,540 --> 02:01:12,560
He broke a long video down into 15 
second chunks.

2700
02:01:12,980 --> 02:01:14,780
You record the whole video and that will
take.

2701
02:01:14,781 --> 02:01:16,670
You got to take time to put it up on the
story,

2702
02:01:16,671 --> 02:01:17,900
but.
But how do you do?

2703
02:01:17,960 --> 02:01:18,793
How do you do one where they seamlessly 
go into the other where there's no 

2704
02:01:21,771 --> 02:01:24,890
breaks?
Just use the next 15 second part.

2705
02:01:25,160 --> 02:01:27,380
Oh God.
It's a little bit of a pain.

2706
02:01:27,381 --> 02:01:28,850
That Dick.
There might be a better way,

2707
02:01:28,940 --> 02:01:30,800
but maybe there's a better way.
I don't think that there is,

2708
02:01:30,950 --> 02:01:33,950
but the way he did is so seamless.
It seems like there is a better way.

2709
02:01:34,700 --> 02:01:37,070
Maybe they're better at it now.
Anyway.

2710
02:01:37,570 --> 02:01:40,070
I'm a thousand huge.

2711
02:01:40,160 --> 02:01:40,993
Kodiak Brown bear charge them because 
they had killed an elk and they had the 

2712
02:01:43,701 --> 02:01:44,534
elk in camp.
They had to meet and camp and this bear 

2713
02:01:45,681 --> 02:01:48,620
just ran over the top of the hill,
full blast at them,

2714
02:01:48,621 --> 02:01:49,454
knocking people left and right,
and they said it was only because there 

2715
02:01:51,351 --> 02:01:53,720
were so many of them that they survived 
and nobody got hurt.

2716
02:01:53,930 --> 02:01:54,763
One guy hit the bear in the face with 
ski poles with like trekking poles and 

2717
02:01:58,491 --> 02:02:00,320
the bear scrambled.
Like he said,

2718
02:02:00,530 --> 02:02:01,363
literally there was giant gnashing teeth
inches from his face and everyone went 

2719
02:02:06,590 --> 02:02:09,260
full bananas.
Everyone went full reptilian.

2720
02:02:09,261 --> 02:02:11,900
They didn't see a common.
They had bear spray and pistols,

2721
02:02:11,901 --> 02:02:13,550
but they couldn't get to them in time.
They're like,

2722
02:02:13,551 --> 02:02:16,270
you think you can handle this?
Like you think you're prepared though,

2723
02:02:16,271 --> 02:02:17,870
oh,
I would've done this next time.

2724
02:02:17,871 --> 02:02:18,704
We should do this.
He's like,

2725
02:02:18,860 --> 02:02:19,371
there,
no.

2726
02:02:19,371 --> 02:02:20,770
Next time there's no you,
you,

2727
02:02:20,790 --> 02:02:24,080
you have no idea how you're gonna react 
when a thousand pound bear runs at you.

2728
02:02:24,170 --> 02:02:26,500
Hell No.
Hell No.

2729
02:02:27,450 --> 02:02:30,500
I had a,
we had a rat in our house and I was like

2730
02:02:30,501 --> 02:02:33,670
terrified of killing it and seeing it 
dead in the.

2731
02:02:33,800 --> 02:02:35,540
But I was excited to put down those 
traps,

2732
02:02:35,541 --> 02:02:36,620
you know,
like the snap traps.

2733
02:02:36,621 --> 02:02:37,880
I was like,
I'm gonna fucking kill this thing.

2734
02:02:38,230 --> 02:02:39,440
Yeah.
I wanted to get like a,

2735
02:02:39,850 --> 02:02:43,670
a night vision camera just to make sure,
you know,

2736
02:02:43,671 --> 02:02:48,350
red band that he captured it on film.
Like the rat getting great in the tree.

2737
02:02:48,380 --> 02:02:50,750
It's horrific.
The thing is screaming.

2738
02:02:51,200 --> 02:02:52,900
The trap gets like,
I know.

2739
02:02:54,390 --> 02:02:57,140
I know when that motherfucker shitting 
all over your house and shitting in your

2740
02:02:57,141 --> 02:03:00,440
kitchen,
that's all I want is to see in the hills

2741
02:03:00,710 --> 02:03:02,090
when you're in the hills,
you get rats.

2742
02:03:02,540 --> 02:03:03,760
No way around it.
No,

2743
02:03:03,780 --> 02:03:05,120
no.
They know.

2744
02:03:05,121 --> 02:03:07,460
It's so silly.
Is that that rat thing.

2745
02:03:07,540 --> 02:03:10,910
I mean we eventually caught it because I
poisoned the fuck out of our yard.

2746
02:03:11,680 --> 02:03:13,460
I was like,
no,

2747
02:03:13,790 --> 02:03:14,750
I loved it.
It was,

2748
02:03:14,810 --> 02:03:17,960
it felt good to kill it,
but I'm fucking showed up dead.

2749
02:03:17,961 --> 02:03:19,520
One day my kid was playing right next to
it.

2750
02:03:19,521 --> 02:03:20,390
I was like,
oh my God,

2751
02:03:20,391 --> 02:03:21,224
it's here.
And it was all stiff and I got to like 

2752
02:03:21,920 --> 02:03:23,390
throw it away.
And it was good.

2753
02:03:23,630 --> 02:03:26,390
Um,
but it really made me realize maybe this

2754
02:03:26,391 --> 02:03:27,224
is like whatever tangent,
but I think I'm becoming more of an 

2755
02:03:29,541 --> 02:03:30,374
atheist to cause you start to realize 
that it really just is like humans 

2756
02:03:35,031 --> 02:03:35,864
versus the elements.
Like it's just us trying to build a 

2757
02:03:38,331 --> 02:03:40,040
fucking house,
trying to keep the road.

2758
02:03:40,041 --> 02:03:42,890
And so trying to keep your shit safe.
Bears from eating,

2759
02:03:42,891 --> 02:03:44,720
you,
trying to keep your young safe,

2760
02:03:44,721 --> 02:03:46,640
trying to get them raised.
It's,

2761
02:03:46,641 --> 02:03:48,140
it's,
we're just animals,

2762
02:03:48,200 --> 02:03:50,840
but we've got like cars and I phones and
Shit,

2763
02:03:50,900 --> 02:03:51,620
you know?
Yeah.

2764
02:03:51,620 --> 02:03:54,710
Well there's definitely a lot of that.
Oh shoot.

2765
02:03:55,070 --> 02:03:55,940
Oh,
I like vision.

2766
02:03:55,970 --> 02:03:58,430
I have this trap to trap one word 
screams,

2767
02:03:58,431 --> 02:03:59,830
but oh yeah.
Is it a,

2768
02:03:59,960 --> 02:04:00,793
is it down?
I was trying to find it out and I don't 

2769
02:04:01,881 --> 02:04:05,000
remember exactly where he had it.
He's got it up somewhere on instagram.

2770
02:04:05,550 --> 02:04:07,160
They caught them.
Good for him.

2771
02:04:07,700 --> 02:04:09,290
This is a good trap.
We have this one too.

2772
02:04:09,320 --> 02:04:10,760
It's an electric one,
I believe,

2773
02:04:11,330 --> 02:04:13,100
but he was hearing them in his walls and
shit.

2774
02:04:14,890 --> 02:04:17,750
God Damn it too.
Have you ever seen rats on Netflix?

2775
02:04:18,180 --> 02:04:19,100
Uh,
wwe.

2776
02:04:19,180 --> 02:04:20,080
No.
Dude,

2777
02:04:20,150 --> 02:04:22,490
the movie.
Stop what you're doing because I'm about

2778
02:04:22,491 --> 02:04:27,491
to ruin this documentary.
Rats on Netflix now,

2779
02:04:30,470 --> 02:04:32,030
bro.
It's fucking amazing.

2780
02:04:32,510 --> 02:04:34,730
It's so scary.
They're nasty as fuck.

2781
02:04:34,731 --> 02:04:38,220
Huh?
There's so and he realized how many

2782
02:04:38,220 --> 02:04:39,630
there are.
There's so many.

2783
02:04:39,680 --> 02:04:43,700
Oh my asshole just tangled and I knew it
overrun.

2784
02:04:44,370 --> 02:04:48,150
They say the weight in humans and the 
weight and rats might be the same.

2785
02:04:49,090 --> 02:04:50,350
Really.
The weight,

2786
02:04:50,360 --> 02:04:51,193
the weight and the weight of rats,
like there might be as many pounds of 

2787
02:04:55,591 --> 02:04:58,440
rat as there are pounds of p.
that's one theory.

2788
02:04:58,441 --> 02:05:01,470
They don't know like it's just guesswork
how many rats there are,

2789
02:05:01,471 --> 02:05:03,960
but they're convinced there's as many 
rats as there are people.

2790
02:05:05,640 --> 02:05:09,690
There's 7 million people in New York.
There's 7 million rats,

2791
02:05:09,900 --> 02:05:13,410
but they say it might be as high as the 
body mass,

2792
02:05:13,680 --> 02:05:16,800
like the bio mass of rats in the biomass
of people.

2793
02:05:17,520 --> 02:05:18,353
See,
that's why I knew when I fucking found 

2794
02:05:19,780 --> 02:05:20,613
more.
Ended up,

2795
02:05:20,900 --> 02:05:21,600
man,
I don't know.

2796
02:05:21,600 --> 02:05:23,480
When you find one,
there's a bunch.

2797
02:05:23,730 --> 02:05:24,563
These unfortunate rats,
we're not part of the study were found 

2798
02:05:26,371 --> 02:05:28,560
hung by the lower east side resident 
last summer.

2799
02:05:28,740 --> 02:05:31,020
They hung rats.
Why they hang on.

2800
02:05:31,021 --> 02:05:32,880
Those are horrendous.
Why?

2801
02:05:32,881 --> 02:05:35,820
They hang them just to let all the other
rats.

2802
02:05:35,821 --> 02:05:39,030
Now listen.
You can't fucking neighborhood.

2803
02:05:39,031 --> 02:05:42,780
Let this be a warning.
You can't see those Cuban rats.

2804
02:05:43,290 --> 02:05:45,890
Cuba.
My husband went there once and they're.

2805
02:05:45,900 --> 02:05:47,700
They're called Nutria.
Oh yeah,

2806
02:05:47,701 --> 02:05:48,534
yeah,
yeah.

2807
02:05:48,720 --> 02:05:51,570
They have those in the south.
They hunt them.

2808
02:05:52,110 --> 02:05:55,470
They apparently they taste good.
Yes.

2809
02:05:55,500 --> 02:05:56,520
Yes.
People Cook them.

2810
02:05:56,580 --> 02:05:58,620
Apparently.
It's like God.

2811
02:05:58,621 --> 02:06:01,170
Did Anthony Bordain have it on a show?
There was no,

2812
02:06:01,230 --> 02:06:04,290
it was on.
Another show was on someone's show.

2813
02:06:04,380 --> 02:06:05,213
Someone had a show about a like edible 
wild animals that people take for 

2814
02:06:09,841 --> 02:06:11,310
granted.
I forget what it was called,

2815
02:06:11,640 --> 02:06:14,610
but he cooked nutria and it was 
delicious.

2816
02:06:14,820 --> 02:06:17,970
He made like this casserole or something
in Uganda.

2817
02:06:18,900 --> 02:06:20,190
In Uganda.
No.

2818
02:06:20,730 --> 02:06:22,410
Yeah,
it was in the south because I think.

2819
02:06:22,411 --> 02:06:22,920
And you've got to attend.

2820
02:06:22,920 --> 02:06:25,380
They fed him a rat and he was like,
it's delicious.

2821
02:06:25,381 --> 02:06:28,830
And you just knew that he was painting.
It was a yellow curry sauce.

2822
02:06:28,950 --> 02:06:31,170
I had squirrel.
I hear it's greasy.

2823
02:06:31,460 --> 02:06:32,400
Uh,
the way I had.

2824
02:06:32,401 --> 02:06:34,110
It wasn't greasy,
but it was good.

2825
02:06:34,290 --> 02:06:38,010
It tasted good.
It didn't taste bad is bad,

2826
02:06:38,011 --> 02:06:39,170
but it's not good.
I mean,

2827
02:06:39,180 --> 02:06:40,980
you've got to think it's a,
it's eating acorns.

2828
02:06:41,310 --> 02:06:42,870
It's like,
yeah,

2829
02:06:43,410 --> 02:06:45,300
it's probably just like rabbits,
like,

2830
02:06:45,301 --> 02:06:50,301
have you ever eat squirrels?
Probably saying I've had a rattle snake.

2831
02:06:50,760 --> 02:06:52,200
Jambalaya.
Really?

2832
02:06:52,250 --> 02:06:53,170
That's okay.
I've had,

2833
02:06:53,180 --> 02:06:54,810
I'll do.
I like alligator.

2834
02:06:54,890 --> 02:06:57,630
I was supposed to go hunt alligator with
a buddy of mine.

2835
02:06:57,990 --> 02:07:01,020
Those are cool.
Hunt for alligator fucking dinosaurs.

2836
02:07:01,021 --> 02:07:02,850
Do.
You're basically shooting a purse.

2837
02:07:04,470 --> 02:07:06,600
When I was on road rules back in the 
nineties,

2838
02:07:06,690 --> 02:07:10,710
we had went to a crocodile farm and run 
road rules.

2839
02:07:10,960 --> 02:07:15,960
90 MTV roles.
Step child of the real world.

2840
02:07:16,741 --> 02:07:17,760
Dude,
I was in a winnebago.

2841
02:07:17,761 --> 02:07:20,030
We went to Australia.
Uh,

2842
02:07:20,540 --> 02:07:23,010
the red headed stepchild was at the same
producers or something.

2843
02:07:23,100 --> 02:07:26,250
Same Company.
Bunin Murray and the real world was like

2844
02:07:26,251 --> 02:07:29,730
the flagship awesome show.
And then like a fraction,

2845
02:07:29,880 --> 02:07:31,200
you know,
watched the road rule.

2846
02:07:31,230 --> 02:07:33,100
Do you know Matt Kuehn?
It's one of the guys who was the,

2847
02:07:33,240 --> 02:07:34,073
you know Matt,
he's the guy who was a producer of a 

2848
02:07:35,500 --> 02:07:36,333
fear factor.

2849
02:07:36,820 --> 02:07:37,720
Yes,
yes,

2850
02:07:37,721 --> 02:07:38,810
yes.
That's a friend of mine.

2851
02:07:38,820 --> 02:07:40,990
I vacation with them.
Oh,

2852
02:07:40,991 --> 02:07:43,720
well tell him I said I do love that 
unit.

2853
02:07:44,050 --> 02:07:46,060
He's a great guy.
There's a lot of good people.

2854
02:07:47,580 --> 02:07:49,330
Good people come in here.
But anyway,

2855
02:07:49,390 --> 02:07:51,610
we worked at the crocodile farm and this
is back in the day.

2856
02:07:51,640 --> 02:07:55,810
There I am.
Look at you and not wearing jeans by the

2857
02:07:55,811 --> 02:07:56,531
way,
Dude.

2858
02:07:56,531 --> 02:07:57,970
You're a baby.
I know.

2859
02:07:58,260 --> 02:08:00,030
You're like a baby.
That's crazy.

2860
02:08:00,640 --> 02:08:05,620
Yeah.
Let's zoom in on her low rez guys.

2861
02:08:05,650 --> 02:08:07,510
Wow.
And a better version of how old were you

2862
02:08:07,511 --> 02:08:08,344
then?
Like 20 or 20 crazy haircuts at 90 

2863
02:08:11,960 --> 02:08:12,793
terabytes.
Isn't it funny that like how people get 

2864
02:08:15,071 --> 02:08:16,540
on those shows and they like,
hey,

2865
02:08:16,541 --> 02:08:20,340
maybe something will happen out of this 
and how few people things happen for me.

2866
02:08:20,341 --> 02:08:23,650
I didn't never know who.
Like Michael Michael.

2867
02:08:23,651 --> 02:08:24,550
Yo.
Do you know Michael?

2868
02:08:24,551 --> 02:08:25,390
Yes,
I do.

2869
02:08:25,730 --> 02:08:29,690
He goes show I'm the first ever episode 
of fear factor really,

2870
02:08:30,640 --> 02:08:32,050
but he's really good.
He's really talented.

2871
02:08:32,260 --> 02:08:33,870
He's a great guy too,
sweetheart.

2872
02:08:34,780 --> 02:08:39,680
But he was like one of the rare guys 
that made it through fear factor and how

2873
02:08:39,681 --> 02:08:41,920
many,
how many people do you think came on?

2874
02:08:41,921 --> 02:08:42,754
Fear factor being like,
someone's going to see me and I want to 

2875
02:08:45,311 --> 02:08:49,870
be discovered and probably a few,
but you know,

2876
02:08:49,871 --> 02:08:50,704
it's not.
That wasn't the show like on American 

2877
02:08:52,661 --> 02:08:55,300
idol now.
Even American idol,

2878
02:08:55,330 --> 02:08:56,163
like think about all the people that 
were on American idol that like what is 

2879
02:08:58,060 --> 02:08:58,893
the percentage of people that are on 
America's got talent that actually have 

2880
02:09:01,301 --> 02:09:03,020
a career afterwards.
It's,

2881
02:09:03,310 --> 02:09:04,143
well,
you know who,

2882
02:09:04,180 --> 02:09:09,180
who actually did was Melissa via Senor.
She was on a jet age as a kid,

2883
02:09:09,611 --> 02:09:13,090
say who's missile where she's now on 
Saturday night live.

2884
02:09:13,120 --> 02:09:15,760
She's an amazing impressionist.

2885
02:09:15,850 --> 02:09:20,620
I mean this girl was on instagram every 
day doing like Gwen Steffani,

2886
02:09:20,650 --> 02:09:21,730
Jaylee,
hold.

2887
02:09:21,760 --> 02:09:23,830
What's his name?
Osmot whole fucks.

2888
02:09:23,831 --> 02:09:25,400
Not from the sixth,
seventh.

2889
02:09:25,930 --> 02:09:26,763
Jelly suck my nuts.
She would do these obscure things and 

2890
02:09:29,351 --> 02:09:30,184
they were spot on and she came on.
Your Mom's house and pretended to be 

2891
02:09:33,161 --> 02:09:36,010
Gloria,
Stefan and was fantastic.

2892
02:09:36,011 --> 02:09:38,260
We played the call for Gloria,
Stefan,

2893
02:09:38,261 --> 02:09:39,370
and she was like,
oh my God,

2894
02:09:39,371 --> 02:09:40,900
this girl is amazing.
Like wow.

2895
02:09:40,930 --> 02:09:42,850
So she's on there.
So I would say that's for sure.

2896
02:09:42,851 --> 02:09:46,570
I know Melissa via senioritis.
Amazing fate or guy.

2897
02:09:46,571 --> 02:09:47,404
He has a fucking theater in Vegas,
but wasn't he always thought he was 

2898
02:09:51,881 --> 02:09:54,550
successful prior to being on?
I don't know.

2899
02:09:54,551 --> 02:09:56,020
I mean he won.
America's got talent.

2900
02:09:56,021 --> 02:09:56,854
That's like his credit was winner of 
America's got talent and they have a 

2901
02:09:59,981 --> 02:10:02,180
theater named after him in Vegas.
It's bananas.

2902
02:10:02,210 --> 02:10:05,440
It's Terry fator theater season to 
season two.

2903
02:10:05,440 --> 02:10:06,880
What are they up to?
Like season 90 now?

2904
02:10:07,070 --> 02:10:07,450
Who?
Wait,

2905
02:10:07,450 --> 02:10:08,710
hold on.
Who's that season?

2906
02:10:08,711 --> 02:10:09,544
10 Guy.
He's trying to be Terry fator this 

2907
02:10:10,631 --> 02:10:11,920
motherfucker.
What's he doing?

2908
02:10:13,220 --> 02:10:15,250
This mother fucker?
British comedian.

2909
02:10:15,340 --> 02:10:15,701
Yeah.
I mean,

2910
02:10:15,701 --> 02:10:17,260
look,
he's got puppets.

2911
02:10:17,530 --> 02:10:20,320
Like there's not a whole lot of guys 
with puppets in America.

2912
02:10:20,560 --> 02:10:21,820
Like,
stop and think about that.

2913
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:22,833
What are the numbers of people that have
like a puppet act that are comics today 

2914
02:10:27,070 --> 02:10:28,750
while we get the Big One?
Uh,

2915
02:10:28,751 --> 02:10:29,950
what's his nuts?
Oh,

2916
02:10:30,330 --> 02:10:31,031
come on.
The Guy,

2917
02:10:31,031 --> 02:10:32,630
he had the same manager.
Yeah.

2918
02:10:32,810 --> 02:10:33,920
Yeah.
That Guy Jeff,

2919
02:10:33,921 --> 02:10:36,530
a denim denim jumped out a huge,
huge.

2920
02:10:36,560 --> 02:10:38,930
He's giant.
He sells out arenas,

2921
02:10:39,200 --> 02:10:43,140
arenas and in like crazy markets that 
you wouldn't want to.

2922
02:10:43,270 --> 02:10:44,720
She want it.
Good for you.

2923
02:10:45,140 --> 02:10:47,060
She's 12.
That's ridiculous.

2924
02:10:47,180 --> 02:10:49,210
Like if I can get her off the stage,
he doesn't know what she's doing.

2925
02:10:50,100 --> 02:10:51,680
Fuck,
that's little.

2926
02:10:51,710 --> 02:10:53,300
Simon.
Simon.

2927
02:10:53,301 --> 02:10:54,530
Simon.
Simon.

2928
02:10:54,640 --> 02:10:56,970
Council.
Yeah.

2929
02:10:57,090 --> 02:10:59,090
Holly,
and then that's the spice.

2930
02:10:59,091 --> 02:11:00,740
What's her name?
Scary spice.

2931
02:11:01,250 --> 02:11:03,620
The comedian that did very well.
He made it to the finals.

2932
02:11:03,770 --> 02:11:07,040
His first thing he did in la I think was
on killed.

2933
02:11:07,041 --> 02:11:08,990
Tony.
He was on killed Tony a few times.

2934
02:11:09,760 --> 02:11:13,240
His name is preacher Lawson and he made 
it all the way to the final design.

2935
02:11:13,250 --> 02:11:15,080
It's got high energy comedian.
Yeah.

2936
02:11:15,300 --> 02:11:15,810
Good.
Good.

2937
02:11:15,810 --> 02:11:18,800
That wow.
Got a lot of energy.

2938
02:11:19,080 --> 02:11:23,060
Yeah.
Jack the Kid.

2939
02:11:23,340 --> 02:11:25,280
He's taking a chance.
Wearing tight clothing too.

2940
02:11:26,420 --> 02:11:29,240
Distracting from us from a stage 
persona.

2941
02:11:30,150 --> 02:11:31,630
Now.
That's an interesting.

2942
02:11:31,631 --> 02:11:35,630
We're talking about this with Brendan 
Schaub show and he doesn't like to dress

2943
02:11:35,631 --> 02:11:36,464
to attractively,
like showing off his physique onstage 

2944
02:11:38,991 --> 02:11:40,320
and women had the similar problems.
You.

2945
02:11:40,321 --> 02:11:43,490
I have huge tits and so one of my 
problems with my special was like,

2946
02:11:43,760 --> 02:11:47,250
how do I fucking cover up these enormous
cans so people aren't like,

2947
02:11:50,530 --> 02:11:51,440
yeah,
please.

2948
02:11:51,480 --> 02:11:56,480
You know,
it's something about totes.

2949
02:12:02,640 --> 02:12:04,310
Well,
the first thing,

2950
02:12:04,710 --> 02:12:05,960
we were talking about this in the 
beginning,

2951
02:12:05,961 --> 02:12:08,960
but when you're born and your mom goes,
here you go and you're like,

2952
02:12:08,990 --> 02:12:11,720
these are great.
Where can I get more of this?

2953
02:12:11,780 --> 02:12:16,160
Plus like tits or God's stereotypes with
the hope that like,

2954
02:12:16,161 --> 02:12:16,994
almost like,
like when you stare up at the sky every 

2955
02:12:18,741 --> 02:12:19,910
now and then you see a shooting star.

2956
02:12:22,670 --> 02:12:25,220
If you stare at tests every now and then
it'll pop out like,

2957
02:12:25,510 --> 02:12:28,430
Whoa,
does that really happen?

2958
02:12:28,660 --> 02:12:30,380
Nip slips are real.
I've seen nip slips.

2959
02:12:30,440 --> 02:12:31,273
I've seen girls like they bend over to 
like fix their shoe and the tip pops 

2960
02:12:34,401 --> 02:12:35,211
out.
Oh my God.

2961
02:12:35,211 --> 02:12:37,130
Did you see that?
Like don't worry,

2962
02:12:37,131 --> 02:12:39,230
it's no big deal.
I looked away as soon as I saw it,

2963
02:12:39,231 --> 02:12:42,740
I'm being respectful.
So at what age does that,

2964
02:12:42,960 --> 02:12:47,960
like what age does that all calm down 
and you become like a civilized human?

2965
02:12:48,140 --> 02:12:48,973
Oh,
sorry.

2966
02:12:49,130 --> 02:12:51,560
The question was this Narnia,
Lynn.

2967
02:12:53,810 --> 02:12:56,370
I think when you look at Harvey Harvey 
Weinstein,

2968
02:12:56,371 --> 02:12:57,470
he's like 70 years old,
right?

2969
02:12:57,471 --> 02:12:58,304
How old is,
he said disgust and getting this rape 

2970
02:13:00,081 --> 02:13:02,440
on.
He's too old to be that rapey.

2971
02:13:03,080 --> 02:13:08,080
Viagara cocaine 60.
Supposed to 65.

2972
02:13:08,321 --> 02:13:13,321
But I think he,
when he come this nasty,

2973
02:13:20,450 --> 02:13:21,770
nasty hot.
Yeah,

2974
02:13:21,771 --> 02:13:23,630
of course he farts when he comes.
Look at him.

2975
02:13:23,780 --> 02:13:24,870
Oh my God.
Question.

2976
02:13:25,430 --> 02:13:27,000
How does a guy,
um,

2977
02:13:27,460 --> 02:13:30,170
bounce back?
This is not balanceable.

2978
02:13:30,350 --> 02:13:31,170
No,
no.

2979
02:13:31,170 --> 02:13:32,050
So what do you do this,

2980
02:13:32,160 --> 02:13:34,200
especially in today's culture where 
it's,

2981
02:13:34,260 --> 02:13:36,300
there's no hall pass anymore for this 
Shit,

2982
02:13:36,390 --> 02:13:37,223
right?
He's just got to go into hiding or like 

2983
02:13:39,241 --> 02:13:40,074
bill cosby do the complete deflection.
Like I don't know what these images are 

2984
02:13:43,411 --> 02:13:45,960
talking about.
Like he's in total denial,

2985
02:13:46,020 --> 02:13:48,570
but he's also a blind.
That's true.

2986
02:13:48,700 --> 02:13:52,000
Cosby's almost completely blind.
And so that.

2987
02:13:52,020 --> 02:13:53,250
It's weird when you look at it.
I'm like,

2988
02:13:54,480 --> 02:13:56,130
Shit.
It's like,

2989
02:13:56,820 --> 02:14:00,630
it's almost like my body is failing on 
his reality.

2990
02:14:03,750 --> 02:14:05,190
The evils,
making them blind.

2991
02:14:05,460 --> 02:14:07,950
I was a fan of his in a big way when I 
was a little kid.

2992
02:14:07,951 --> 02:14:08,784
Of course,
I remember listening to a bill cosby 

2993
02:14:11,191 --> 02:14:15,420
himself.
I mean his eyes were all fucked up.

2994
02:14:15,421 --> 02:14:17,640
Now guys like really aggressive 
glaucoma.

2995
02:14:17,641 --> 02:14:19,910
Go with the one above.
It is the art,

2996
02:14:19,970 --> 02:14:23,400
the folded hands.
Like that picture right there.

2997
02:14:25,220 --> 02:14:27,170
That's the mugshot.
Got It.

2998
02:14:28,740 --> 02:14:29,573
It's just so weird to go from that 
picture to the one in the upper right 

2999
02:14:33,030 --> 02:14:36,000
where he's smiling like what happened?

3000
02:14:36,470 --> 02:14:37,303
Like this was,
this was the guy we thought we were 

3001
02:14:38,791 --> 02:14:39,624
getting right now that we're getting 
Jello pudding America looking at me 

3002
02:14:44,241 --> 02:14:45,074
smiling.
Imagine if you were the girl who this 

3003
02:14:46,801 --> 02:14:48,350
guy raped.
Oh my God.

3004
02:14:48,360 --> 02:14:51,120
And you had to watch him be like America
sweetheart.

3005
02:14:51,760 --> 02:14:52,531
And you're like,
no,

3006
02:14:52,531 --> 02:14:54,150
you're a monster.
You're,

3007
02:14:54,170 --> 02:14:56,310
you're,
you're taking people's humanity.

3008
02:14:56,820 --> 02:14:59,070
It's so crazy.
Like the Hugh hefner thing,

3009
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:01,590
he's just a freak.
You know?

3010
02:15:01,591 --> 02:15:04,290
They know what they're signing up for.
He's not dragging anybody.

3011
02:15:04,650 --> 02:15:05,351
That's true.
And,

3012
02:15:05,351 --> 02:15:07,460
and everyone's kind of aware.
Yeah,

3013
02:15:08,360 --> 02:15:10,590
it's creepy.
It's not going to be great,

3014
02:15:10,620 --> 02:15:12,540
but there is an exchange here.
You get free rent.

3015
02:15:13,230 --> 02:15:16,290
The Pajama thing.
Even Harvey's not drugging anybody.

3016
02:15:16,590 --> 02:15:18,890
I don't know that we don't know yet.
I don't know.

3017
02:15:19,380 --> 02:15:20,920
I'm just talking shit,
but I'm,

3018
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:23,700
I'm for the stories that I've,
I'm here and he's just like,

3019
02:15:23,910 --> 02:15:26,690
was just trying,
like again throwing.

3020
02:15:26,710 --> 02:15:27,543
He's,
he's missing a lot of pitches like over 

3021
02:15:29,701 --> 02:15:30,511
the years.
Right.

3022
02:15:30,511 --> 02:15:31,344
So if 25 women have come forward,
how many did he just fucking knock it 

3023
02:15:34,921 --> 02:15:37,410
out of the park?
Inside the mind of Bill Cosby.

3024
02:15:37,411 --> 02:15:38,244
Why?
What do you wish we could really get in 

3025
02:15:40,141 --> 02:15:41,160
there?
It's just like pills,

3026
02:15:41,310 --> 02:15:42,143
rape,
rerecord that humming and people are 

3027
02:15:43,681 --> 02:15:44,514
asleep.

3028
02:15:46,440 --> 02:15:50,910
How is that your favorite too?
Like I need you to be totally dead.

3029
02:15:51,410 --> 02:15:52,960
I don't know.
Um,

3030
02:15:53,310 --> 02:15:54,143
I've heard theories.
One of the theories that I heard that 

3031
02:15:55,861 --> 02:15:56,694
was kind of interesting is that when you
are that much of a celebrity in a time 

3032
02:16:01,531 --> 02:16:03,710
where there's no repercussions like pre 
Internet,

3033
02:16:03,720 --> 02:16:04,580
right?
Yeah.

3034
02:16:04,860 --> 02:16:06,780
That your,
um,

3035
02:16:06,840 --> 02:16:10,200
your thoughts of who you are in 
comparison to who other people are,

3036
02:16:10,740 --> 02:16:13,440
is that you really literally feel like 
you're royalty.

3037
02:16:13,890 --> 02:16:15,690
You are,
you're better than other people.

3038
02:16:15,800 --> 02:16:16,633
Mean I worked at a casino wants and they
told me that this was before bill cause 

3039
02:16:19,421 --> 02:16:20,254
we got arrested.
This was when the allegations were just 

3040
02:16:22,950 --> 02:16:25,530
before they were even emerging.
This was before anything happened.

3041
02:16:25,680 --> 02:16:26,513
They were talking about how weird he was
and that he made the employees all sit 

3042
02:16:29,861 --> 02:16:32,260
down and watch him eat curry.
He,

3043
02:16:32,290 --> 02:16:33,123
uh,
he had to have everybody in that was 

3044
02:16:34,691 --> 02:16:36,250
working there,
door people,

3045
02:16:36,280 --> 02:16:37,000
box office.

3046
02:16:37,000 --> 02:16:39,610
They had to sit in the room with him and
watch him while he ate.

3047
02:16:40,390 --> 02:16:43,390
And then he had a security guard,
tuck him into bed,

3048
02:16:43,391 --> 02:16:46,570
like literally talk him into bed at 
night when he went to sleep.

3049
02:16:47,650 --> 02:16:48,483
What's the curry though?
Wanted people to watch a meat and then 

3050
02:16:50,651 --> 02:16:51,860
watch them take a shit.
Like,

3051
02:16:52,090 --> 02:16:55,120
I don't even think.
I mean you could,

3052
02:16:55,750 --> 02:16:56,583
you could be generous and say,
well maybe it was like his way of 

3053
02:16:58,901 --> 02:16:59,734
getting over stage fright.
Like he gets over the feeling of people 

3054
02:17:02,261 --> 02:17:04,630
watching him.
Does he all these people staring at them

3055
02:17:04,631 --> 02:17:06,970
and then going onstage.
Like it could be an effective strategy.

3056
02:17:07,000 --> 02:17:11,170
Like if you really think about it,
have you have a room full of people that

3057
02:17:11,171 --> 02:17:12,004
are just staring at you and you just 
doing normal stuff and then you go on 

3058
02:17:14,421 --> 02:17:16,600
stage.
It's like you've kind of relaxed.

3059
02:17:16,710 --> 02:17:17,543
Sure.
The.

3060
02:17:17,560 --> 02:17:18,460
Does that make any sense?

3061
02:17:19,830 --> 02:17:20,660
No,
no,

3062
02:17:20,660 --> 02:17:23,660
I meant does it does for somebody who 
would.

3063
02:17:23,690 --> 02:17:26,240
Who would I just.
For me personally,

3064
02:17:26,510 --> 02:17:30,380
the power move of doing that is such an 
asshole thing.

3065
02:17:30,800 --> 02:17:31,491
Like,
hey everybody,

3066
02:17:31,491 --> 02:17:33,620
stop what you're doing.
Watch me eat curry.

3067
02:17:33,840 --> 02:17:35,570
It's so absurd.
It's like,

3068
02:17:35,571 --> 02:17:37,060
do you really need that?
Is that

3069
02:17:37,210 --> 02:17:38,043
this?
So the woman who was working there was 

3070
02:17:38,471 --> 02:17:40,320
telling me that's how she was thinking 
about.

3071
02:17:40,360 --> 02:17:41,740
She's like,
he's so weird.

3072
02:17:41,990 --> 02:17:42,823
I was like,
how so?

3073
02:17:43,180 --> 02:17:44,013
And then she was just telling me all 
these stories in the dressing room and 

3074
02:17:46,980 --> 02:17:49,210
I'll be standing around.
That's a power move though.

3075
02:17:49,240 --> 02:17:50,980
20 people.
That's a power.

3076
02:17:50,981 --> 02:17:52,210
That's,
that's hey,

3077
02:17:52,270 --> 02:17:53,770
do do what I say.
Yeah.

3078
02:17:54,340 --> 02:17:56,010
Taught me in,
Tuck me,

3079
02:17:56,230 --> 02:17:57,960
talk to me in.
I keep it.

3080
02:17:57,961 --> 02:18:02,961
Climb in bed and you'd have to like,
like a little Burrito Burrito.

3081
02:18:03,070 --> 02:18:07,090
Read them and go to sleep.
Mood now who shot the light out?

3082
02:18:07,120 --> 02:18:07,953
Now?
Leave.

3083
02:18:09,580 --> 02:18:11,740
That's so dark.
Well I,

3084
02:18:11,741 --> 02:18:12,574
you know,
like a lot of these people have like a 

3085
02:18:13,721 --> 02:18:17,260
whole team of handlers opened the door 
for Mr Cosby,

3086
02:18:17,610 --> 02:18:19,810
you know,
like Mr Cosby sits down,

3087
02:18:20,770 --> 02:18:21,603
you know,
you might want to buckle them up on a 

3088
02:18:22,760 --> 02:18:23,830
buffalo hump.
Mr Cosby,

3089
02:18:24,200 --> 02:18:25,033
Mr Cosby just sits there.
You buckle them up and he just drives 

3090
02:18:29,350 --> 02:18:29,950
weird.

3091
02:18:29,950 --> 02:18:31,990
Yeah.
It's not even like,

3092
02:18:31,991 --> 02:18:33,400
I don't know.
I can't connect.

3093
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:35,320
I don't know.
Some people.

3094
02:18:35,321 --> 02:18:40,321
I think I probably liked the idea of 
royalty like being royal.

3095
02:18:40,830 --> 02:18:42,820
It sounds like a jail.
Sounds terrible.

3096
02:18:43,600 --> 02:18:47,220
I follow on instagram a kate,
you know the,

3097
02:18:47,230 --> 02:18:52,230
the new royal and Kate.
It's kate of Berkshire or whatever.

3098
02:18:52,420 --> 02:18:56,500
Fucking prince and Princess Kate Shaw 
and it's such as Kate Middleton.

3099
02:18:56,710 --> 02:18:57,550
Yeah.
Kate Middleton.

3100
02:18:57,570 --> 02:18:59,470
Yeah.
And the fantasy.

3101
02:18:59,650 --> 02:19:01,690
And I think in addition to the like 
thing,

3102
02:19:01,720 --> 02:19:02,290
right?
That,

3103
02:19:02,290 --> 02:19:03,123
that sort of whatever culture is the 
culture of people putting forward their 

3104
02:19:06,791 --> 02:19:09,820
best image all the time.
You're not really posting.

3105
02:19:09,850 --> 02:19:10,683
Yeah.
And could you imagine the absolute hell 

3106
02:19:14,021 --> 02:19:16,870
of being that 24 slash seven?
I mean,

3107
02:19:16,871 --> 02:19:19,060
I,
I would have it so much,

3108
02:19:19,390 --> 02:19:22,120
but someone look forward to that.
Someone did someone go,

3109
02:19:22,121 --> 02:19:22,954
Oh,
I wish there was some girls dreaming of 

3110
02:19:25,001 --> 02:19:28,250
being Kate Middleton.
Be Amazing.

3111
02:19:28,910 --> 02:19:30,110
I want to be kate.
Look at her.

3112
02:19:30,350 --> 02:19:31,450
She's very nice.
Yeah,

3113
02:19:31,600 --> 02:19:32,570
no,
she's fantastic.

3114
02:19:32,780 --> 02:19:34,640
She's doing a great job.
He's got a hog on them.

3115
02:19:34,910 --> 02:19:35,743
No.
What tall skinny guy might have a hard 

3116
02:19:37,810 --> 02:19:40,550
high.
You know the Brits are not known for for

3117
02:19:40,551 --> 02:19:42,500
hogs.
I lived in England for a year.

3118
02:19:42,501 --> 02:19:45,530
I did not do anything.
I didn't touch on English hog,

3119
02:19:45,531 --> 02:19:48,710
but I had a gay friend that was touching
all of the hogs and he was like,

3120
02:19:48,711 --> 02:19:50,870
I'm not impressed.
Not impressed.

3121
02:19:51,500 --> 02:19:52,160
Yeah.

3122
02:19:52,160 --> 02:19:53,840
What it will be.
This comment score.

3123
02:19:54,280 --> 02:19:55,113
Great.
Grandfather John committed suicide at 

3124
02:19:56,591 --> 02:19:57,880
age 30,
43.

3125
02:19:58,180 --> 02:20:01,180
His sister Julia remained a spinster her
whole life.

3126
02:20:01,360 --> 02:20:04,030
I believe she lived with brother 
Ebeneezer.

3127
02:20:04,031 --> 02:20:08,050
The shipwright fuck.
Fuck kind of comment.

3128
02:20:08,051 --> 02:20:10,070
Is that this guy's leaving a bunch of 
comments currently.

3129
02:20:10,080 --> 02:20:11,110
Yeah.
Was just weird.

3130
02:20:11,490 --> 02:20:13,020
Just a bunch of stuff talking to him.
Yeah.

3131
02:20:13,021 --> 02:20:16,390
We'll get this Iran deal.
What kind of obtrusive,

3132
02:20:16,391 --> 02:20:19,150
scandalous and disgraceful gnosis is 
this?

3133
02:20:19,310 --> 02:20:20,143
I am not one of the grand and glorious 
vetted ones privy to the global secrets 

3134
02:20:24,341 --> 02:20:24,911
like,
oh,

3135
02:20:24,911 --> 02:20:25,744
this guy's a nut.
This guy is leaving some interesting 

3136
02:20:28,481 --> 02:20:31,570
comments.
This is Kensington,

3137
02:20:31,571 --> 02:20:33,940
royal instagram page.
How many likes they have?

3138
02:20:33,941 --> 02:20:37,560
Their 119,000
conor mcgregor shits on you royals.

3139
02:20:38,440 --> 02:20:42,910
He shits on your numbers to two point 2 
million spit at that.

3140
02:20:44,700 --> 02:20:49,700
You know what's a great instagram is a 
passenger shaming that.

3141
02:20:50,330 --> 02:20:51,260
Oh,
it's fantastic.

3142
02:20:51,261 --> 02:20:52,094
It's a.
it's a flight attendant and she takes 

3143
02:20:53,721 --> 02:20:54,554
photos of people putting their nasty 
feet up on the seats and on the trays 

3144
02:20:57,740 --> 02:21:01,370
and acting like fools and then she puts 
it up and they talk some shit.

3145
02:21:01,400 --> 02:21:02,450
It's fantastic.
Yeah.

3146
02:21:02,451 --> 02:21:04,160
See people look at this.
Look at this.

3147
02:21:04,161 --> 02:21:04,994
Nasty people are gross.
Putting your feet up on the fucking 

3148
02:21:08,300 --> 02:21:09,500
thing.
Oh yeah.

3149
02:21:09,860 --> 02:21:11,570
I just had someone do it last week to 
me.

3150
02:21:11,990 --> 02:21:15,280
They put their foot in between the seat.
See how that dog is there?

3151
02:21:15,350 --> 02:21:15,620
What was

3152
02:21:15,620 --> 02:21:16,453
there?
You saw the foot where you're looking 

3153
02:21:17,330 --> 02:21:18,500
down.
It was right there.

3154
02:21:18,501 --> 02:21:19,940
Did you say anything?
No,

3155
02:21:19,941 --> 02:21:21,500
I just took a patriot.
Put It on instagram.

3156
02:21:23,380 --> 02:21:24,213
It is nasty.
People are fucking gross and sometimes 

3157
02:21:26,451 --> 02:21:29,810
their feet will touch you,
like if someone's hand touches you.

3158
02:21:29,900 --> 02:21:30,910
No big deal.
Yeah,

3159
02:21:30,980 --> 02:21:32,870
the foot.
You're fucking stinky feet.

3160
02:21:34,020 --> 02:21:35,030
My daughter,
the other day,

3161
02:21:35,031 --> 02:21:36,770
the same one that's making me wear this 
bracelet.

3162
02:21:37,130 --> 02:21:39,020
A daughter made this bracelet for my 
seven year old.

3163
02:21:39,021 --> 02:21:39,854
She's fucking hilarious.
She had a bandaid on her finger and she 

3164
02:21:42,711 --> 02:21:44,750
kept it on all day and she goes,
dad,

3165
02:21:44,751 --> 02:21:45,680
smell my finger.
I'm like,

3166
02:21:45,690 --> 02:21:47,300
I lost my finger.
She was,

3167
02:21:47,301 --> 02:21:48,170
come on,
smell my finger.

3168
02:21:48,171 --> 02:21:49,790
I don't want to smell your finger.
She goes,

3169
02:21:49,791 --> 02:21:53,150
it smells like roses and I smell it.
Smelled like Joey Diaz his feet.

3170
02:21:53,740 --> 02:21:55,280
So now she's laughing.
She's like,

3171
02:21:55,281 --> 02:21:57,290
ah,
it's disgusting.

3172
02:21:59,020 --> 02:22:03,260
She thought it was so funny that she got
me to smell it that I gave in after I'll

3173
02:22:03,261 --> 02:22:04,094
go,
okay,

3174
02:22:05,750 --> 02:22:10,750
this is a tiny little seven year old.
Like it's just so funny to her.

3175
02:22:11,150 --> 02:22:11,983
It's so good.
It's funny when you see this about your 

3176
02:22:13,791 --> 02:22:14,990
son,
as he gets older,

3177
02:22:15,020 --> 02:22:15,853
they have their own little way of 
talking and thinking about things and 

3178
02:22:18,680 --> 02:22:19,513
communicating with you and the little 
calculated way of interfacing with the 

3179
02:22:22,551 --> 02:22:24,050
world.
So weird.

3180
02:22:24,350 --> 02:22:25,980
I see it already.
I see some

3181
02:22:25,980 --> 02:22:27,810
manipulation.
Ted Talks.

3182
02:22:28,080 --> 02:22:28,950
He's starting to.
Yeah,

3183
02:22:29,480 --> 02:22:31,270
words,
words that done.

3184
02:22:31,290 --> 02:22:32,640
You can say certain things.
Yeah,

3185
02:22:32,641 --> 02:22:33,391
that's cute.
As a bug.

3186
02:22:33,391 --> 02:22:34,900
I love it.
It's so amazing.

3187
02:22:34,980 --> 02:22:39,840
I like it was strange or making people.
It's bananas and I always.

3188
02:22:40,140 --> 02:22:42,540
We look at him and I'm like,
tweet.

3189
02:22:42,660 --> 02:22:43,493
We made this dude like one weekend in 
Virginia beach when you were at the 

3190
02:22:47,221 --> 02:22:48,054
funny bone,
but we're reading at Ruth's Chris and 

3191
02:22:53,190 --> 02:22:54,023
then this fucking guy.
When you see Tommy now with this crazy 

3192
02:22:58,650 --> 02:22:59,950
fitness routine.
I mean he,

3193
02:23:00,110 --> 02:23:02,460
he looks fantastic.
I mean I saw him the other night.

3194
02:23:02,461 --> 02:23:03,320
I was like,
Jesus Christ,

3195
02:23:03,321 --> 02:23:05,470
look how fucking great you look like 
he's.

3196
02:23:05,700 --> 02:23:08,640
He lost all that weight from the weight 
loss challenge and then just fucking ran

3197
02:23:08,641 --> 02:23:12,050
with it.
He is so much happier now and I,

3198
02:23:12,230 --> 02:23:13,063
I sing the praises of the fat shaming 
campaign and I think that shaming is 

3199
02:23:16,951 --> 02:23:17,784
such a wonderful tool to get people to 
jumpstart whatever it is that they need 

3200
02:23:21,601 --> 02:23:23,160
to,
but people don't want to hear that.

3201
02:23:23,340 --> 02:23:25,290
No,
but shame is a wonderful.

3202
02:23:25,320 --> 02:23:26,153
It's not,
it's not necessarily bad to feel shame 

3203
02:23:28,331 --> 02:23:31,180
shaming is okay in small doses.
It's motivate you.

3204
02:23:31,870 --> 02:23:32,703
Yeah.
Some people need to be motivated and in 

3205
02:23:35,550 --> 02:23:36,383
whatever way they can get,
but the thing is it makes people feel 

3206
02:23:38,521 --> 02:23:40,440
bad and people don't want people to feel
bad.

3207
02:23:40,950 --> 02:23:41,783
Yeah.
Well feeling bad is what makes you 

3208
02:23:42,541 --> 02:23:45,150
change.
But some people in the shame you,

3209
02:23:45,151 --> 02:23:47,010
they're shaming you because they're just
being mean.

3210
02:23:47,130 --> 02:23:50,100
Any positive consequences that come from
that are just in consequential.

3211
02:23:50,101 --> 02:23:51,900
They're just,
they're just lucky.

3212
02:23:53,310 --> 02:23:54,143
But in this case,
I think it was a constructive shame and 

3213
02:23:57,310 --> 02:23:58,143
other.
We're both wanting to lose weight in 

3214
02:23:59,581 --> 02:24:00,414
there.
Tom and burt were both shitting on each 

3215
02:24:01,771 --> 02:24:03,800
other equally back and forth.
Yes.

3216
02:24:03,810 --> 02:24:04,643
So crazy.
But what was interesting is like fans 

3217
02:24:06,031 --> 02:24:08,640
got really into it and we're really mean
about it.

3218
02:24:08,670 --> 02:24:09,330
Yes.

3219
02:24:09,330 --> 02:24:11,520
And uh,
and really funny about it,

3220
02:24:11,550 --> 02:24:13,590
we got many submissions on your mom's 
house,

3221
02:24:13,591 --> 02:24:16,060
international submissions of like,
uh,

3222
02:24:16,110 --> 02:24:20,270
English teachers and their classrooms,
like teaching them how to say burtis fat

3223
02:24:20,271 --> 02:24:22,680
in English and then like speaking Indian
or something,

3224
02:24:22,681 --> 02:24:23,880
it was,
it was really cool.

3225
02:24:24,090 --> 02:24:24,923
So many videos I started doing like 
local TV stations and talking to them 

3226
02:24:29,191 --> 02:24:34,191
about how fat burgers just get online 
and it just got so crazy,

3227
02:24:36,510 --> 02:24:37,343
you know,
and then people would go to burt's show 

3228
02:24:38,641 --> 02:24:40,570
and yell out Tom's fat.
Yeah.

3229
02:24:40,650 --> 02:24:41,483
You know,
and like Tom's shows people yell out 

3230
02:24:43,230 --> 02:24:44,340
wise.
So fat.

3231
02:24:44,650 --> 02:24:47,410
I definitely think the bird is fat 
campaign took off a lot.

3232
02:24:47,830 --> 02:24:52,830
I would say that guts and heat and uh,
I think his podcast births is struggling

3233
02:24:53,191 --> 02:24:54,024
in comparison to Tom's doors.
I think you guys have a much more 

3234
02:24:56,521 --> 02:24:58,010
powerful presence online.
Yeah.

3235
02:24:58,320 --> 02:25:00,270
And it's like he fucked with the wrong 
dude.

3236
02:25:00,390 --> 02:25:01,560
He did.
He did fight with around it.

3237
02:25:01,920 --> 02:25:04,830
Now sober October.
We are how many?

3238
02:25:04,831 --> 02:25:06,530
Eleven days in?
Yeah,

3239
02:25:06,940 --> 02:25:10,110
today's the 11th.
Everybody knows I'm not smoking pot.

3240
02:25:10,140 --> 02:25:11,490
All right.
Why?

3241
02:25:11,491 --> 02:25:12,324
Because I got shamed into it because it 
was being a fucking bitch is what you 

3242
02:25:15,511 --> 02:25:18,630
can't smoke pot like I can.
It's just that wasn't part of the deal.

3243
02:25:18,780 --> 02:25:21,630
And I thought about it on September 31st
or whatever it was.

3244
02:25:21,631 --> 02:25:22,321
September.
What is it?

3245
02:25:22,321 --> 02:25:23,440
Thirty one.
Thirty,

3246
02:25:23,580 --> 02:25:24,520
30.
And I was like,

3247
02:25:24,550 --> 02:25:25,570
fuck this.
I'm like,

3248
02:25:25,571 --> 02:25:26,404
I don't need to smoke pot,
I'm going to take the whole month top 

3249
02:25:27,401 --> 02:25:28,234
pot too.
So I've taken the whole month out pot 

3250
02:25:29,800 --> 02:25:33,960
and one of the things that's interesting
is my dreams aren't.

3251
02:25:34,620 --> 02:25:35,453
Hence,
I had a dream last night and maybe it 

3252
02:25:37,711 --> 02:25:38,544
was [inaudible].
I'm paying attention all this Harvey 

3253
02:25:39,490 --> 02:25:40,323
Weinstein chip.
I had a dream last night that there was 

3254
02:25:42,581 --> 02:25:47,560
some Russian woman who was married to 
some Russian dictator.

3255
02:25:47,560 --> 02:25:52,560
Dude that was seducing me and I was 
terrified seducing you are the girl.

3256
02:25:53,860 --> 02:25:55,390
The woman was,
she was like,

3257
02:25:55,391 --> 02:25:57,340
uh,
some really hot Russian woman,

3258
02:25:57,341 --> 02:25:58,174
but I was terrified of her because she 
was the wife of some really powerful 

3259
02:26:02,171 --> 02:26:04,480
man.
And she was like making me hang out with

3260
02:26:04,481 --> 02:26:06,820
her and like I didn't fuck her in my 
dreams.

3261
02:26:07,090 --> 02:26:08,560
But uh,
like I was like,

3262
02:26:08,680 --> 02:26:13,480
you know,
basically like being submissive to her,

3263
02:26:13,620 --> 02:26:14,453
you know,
it was very strange and we were on a 

3264
02:26:16,481 --> 02:26:18,610
boat somehow or another,
like it was super vivid.

3265
02:26:18,970 --> 02:26:19,803
We're looking at.
And I looked out the window and another 

3266
02:26:20,560 --> 02:26:22,480
boat was really close to us,
but it didn't collide with us.

3267
02:26:22,481 --> 02:26:23,110
I'm like,
oh,

3268
02:26:23,110 --> 02:26:25,810
but it was like super vivid and I was 
thinking like,

3269
02:26:25,811 --> 02:26:27,380
wow,
like,

3270
02:26:27,400 --> 02:26:29,020
and um,
this was last night.

3271
02:26:29,021 --> 02:26:29,854
Yeah.
And I was thinking I didn't have any 

3272
02:26:30,401 --> 02:26:33,460
Alpha brain before I went to bed either.
It wasn't like one of those dreams,

3273
02:26:33,610 --> 02:26:35,950
but it was a,
it was really vivid,

3274
02:26:36,040 --> 02:26:36,873
like really.
And that's one of the things that I'd 

3275
02:26:37,240 --> 02:26:41,760
heard when people stop smoking pot,
is it their dreams become very vivid and

3276
02:26:41,780 --> 02:26:42,730
you remember your dreams

3277
02:26:43,190 --> 02:26:44,023
now in my,
my therapist will do dream analysis on 

3278
02:26:47,091 --> 02:26:47,980
me.
Uh,

3279
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:48,833
and it's usually people who represent 
either feelings you have or you don't 

3280
02:26:52,281 --> 02:26:54,320
really dream you dream and symbolism.
Right?

3281
02:26:54,470 --> 02:26:58,250
So the Russian lady could be whoever,
it could be your mother,

3282
02:26:58,251 --> 02:26:58,890
your sister,
your

3283
02:26:58,890 --> 02:27:01,160
wife.
You're represented power to me,

3284
02:27:01,210 --> 02:27:05,240
like the feeling of being like,
you know,

3285
02:27:05,241 --> 02:27:07,970
like it's,
it's very unusual for a man to feel like

3286
02:27:07,971 --> 02:27:11,090
they're in a position where a woman has 
power over them unless it's your boss.

3287
02:27:11,150 --> 02:27:11,983
Right?
So for me it was like this feeling of 

3288
02:27:14,931 --> 02:27:15,764
this woman who I couldn't say no to and 
I was scared of because she was like 

3289
02:27:19,930 --> 02:27:22,070
the,
she was married to some dictator,

3290
02:27:22,490 --> 02:27:23,181
you know,
and she's like,

3291
02:27:23,181 --> 02:27:25,550
come into my room.
I went to go with me.

3292
02:27:26,000 --> 02:27:27,170
She was really beautiful.
I was like,

3293
02:27:27,200 --> 02:27:27,801
oh,
okay,

3294
02:27:27,801 --> 02:27:28,491
yeah,
sure,

3295
02:27:28,491 --> 02:27:30,350
I'll do whatever.
But I was like really?

3296
02:27:30,351 --> 02:27:31,550
Like,
nervous around her and said,

3297
02:27:32,660 --> 02:27:33,493
no,
not in the dream now unless I forgot 

3298
02:27:34,791 --> 02:27:35,690
that part.
Yeah.

3299
02:27:36,380 --> 02:27:38,440
I mean it was really weird.
It was like,

3300
02:27:38,450 --> 02:27:40,310
because I was like,
I better do what she says,

3301
02:27:40,311 --> 02:27:42,670
like one of those things.
And I was thinking like a modern,

3302
02:27:42,680 --> 02:27:44,990
whether that's,
if that's what it feels like to be like,

3303
02:27:46,250 --> 02:27:48,650
like someone how to deal with someone 
like Harvey Weinstein.

3304
02:27:48,920 --> 02:27:51,590
I was wondering if that's what planted 
that seed in my head.

3305
02:27:51,591 --> 02:27:52,424
Like if I was a young starlet hoping to 
make it in the business and he was the 

3306
02:27:55,911 --> 02:27:57,050
guy that held,
you know,

3307
02:27:57,051 --> 02:27:59,880
possible my future in front of me.
Right.

3308
02:28:00,310 --> 02:28:01,390
Well also the dreams.
Uh,

3309
02:28:01,391 --> 02:28:02,224
anyway,
my shrink says that when you do your 

3310
02:28:03,161 --> 02:28:03,994
dream analysis,
a lot of times it's feelings you can't 

3311
02:28:05,650 --> 02:28:09,160
deal with in waking life.
So it's the feeling in the dream.

3312
02:28:09,550 --> 02:28:12,610
What do you our powerlessness would 
think they would say about this dream?

3313
02:28:12,640 --> 02:28:14,500
I don't know because I don't know enough
about your personal life.

3314
02:28:14,920 --> 02:28:16,600
It would have to know more about your 
dynamics,

3315
02:28:16,601 --> 02:28:18,600
like between your wife,
your,

3316
02:28:18,670 --> 02:28:22,760
whoever else is in your world because 
it'll always represents other people you

3317
02:28:22,761 --> 02:28:23,750
won't,
you won't ever dream.

3318
02:28:23,751 --> 02:28:25,430
Like if you have problems with your 
mommy and your daddy,

3319
02:28:25,431 --> 02:28:26,300
it's not really.
You never,

3320
02:28:26,780 --> 02:28:28,070
for instance,
whenever it's just so weird.

3321
02:28:28,071 --> 02:28:31,850
But whenever I dream about my father,
I actually dream about Howard Stern.

3322
02:28:32,270 --> 02:28:33,770
Like I associate the two.
Yeah.

3323
02:28:33,771 --> 02:28:34,604
So Howard starting shows up so they have
a similar sense of humor and I grew up 

3324
02:28:38,571 --> 02:28:41,030
on stern and I see stern is like a 
paternal,

3325
02:28:41,390 --> 02:28:44,660
you know,
he could be my dad like in a lot of ways

3326
02:28:44,661 --> 02:28:47,250
he's my comedy dad.
Like I grew up just worshiping.

3327
02:28:47,440 --> 02:28:48,273
Starting.
Yeah.

3328
02:28:49,010 --> 02:28:50,480
So whenever I start,
I know,

3329
02:28:50,481 --> 02:28:50,961
it's like,
oh,

3330
02:28:50,961 --> 02:28:51,794
I have it.
It's a data issue that would you be 

3331
02:28:52,371 --> 02:28:55,490
weirded out if you did a show?
I would fucking love.

3332
02:28:55,491 --> 02:28:56,780
It's so much.
It's my dream.

3333
02:28:56,840 --> 02:28:59,300
That's one of my.
I don't get geeked out on celebrities.

3334
02:28:59,301 --> 02:29:00,134
I don't really care.
P would be the only one that I had been 

3335
02:29:02,501 --> 02:29:03,270
nervous.
He was

3336
02:29:03,270 --> 02:29:05,760
the most important thing that I ever did
for sure.

3337
02:29:05,761 --> 02:29:07,730
To me.
In my mind he was like,

3338
02:29:08,090 --> 02:29:11,220
like I didn't give a fuck if I was on 
the tonight show didn't mean anything to

3339
02:29:11,221 --> 02:29:13,710
me.
I was never a tonight show comic like my

3340
02:29:13,711 --> 02:29:14,544
in my mind,
like all those things were like for 

3341
02:29:15,961 --> 02:29:17,640
people who want to do seven clean 
minutes.

3342
02:29:17,641 --> 02:29:19,760
And I was a Kennison guy.
You know?

3343
02:29:19,820 --> 02:29:20,940
I liked Kennison.
I,

3344
02:29:20,950 --> 02:29:23,010
I liked,
I like dice,

3345
02:29:23,011 --> 02:29:24,060
I liked,
you know,

3346
02:29:24,061 --> 02:29:24,894
I like Richard Pryor.
Like I didn't want to be that kind of 

3347
02:29:26,850 --> 02:29:27,683
squeaky clean comics.
So to me Howard stern was like this 

3348
02:29:31,680 --> 02:29:32,513
groundbreaker,
like he was the first guy to ever just 

3349
02:29:34,531 --> 02:29:37,320
do an all talk show on regular radio.
Right.

3350
02:29:37,470 --> 02:29:40,260
I mean he used to do songs used to play 
records,

3351
02:29:40,500 --> 02:29:41,333
but then it became just the stuff in 
between the records was even better and 

3352
02:29:45,331 --> 02:29:48,120
then it became all that and when I was a
kid,

3353
02:29:48,210 --> 02:29:49,043
I mean I've heard like there was some 
funny shows in Boston with back in the 

3354
02:29:52,080 --> 02:29:53,880
day when they had real djs and shit like
that,

3355
02:29:54,210 --> 02:29:55,920
but I'd always heard about stern,
you know,

3356
02:29:56,130 --> 02:29:56,963
and then once I first started listening 
to them and it was like he was on in 

3357
02:30:00,181 --> 02:30:02,850
Boston as well and I was thinking like 
that.

3358
02:30:03,270 --> 02:30:05,910
That's the,
that's the holy grail.

3359
02:30:06,010 --> 02:30:06,843
Like that's when you get there.
Especially then back in the day when he 

3360
02:30:09,121 --> 02:30:11,070
was on like regular radio and everybody 
was listening.

3361
02:30:11,071 --> 02:30:11,850
I was like,
you know,

3362
02:30:11,850 --> 02:30:14,340
he'd get like 18 million people 
listening to a show.

3363
02:30:14,580 --> 02:30:15,413
Crazy.
There's nothing I'd ever like that 

3364
02:30:16,261 --> 02:30:17,220
before or since.

3365
02:30:17,280 --> 02:30:18,300
No.
And I used to,

3366
02:30:18,330 --> 02:30:19,163
I worked in my dad's shop.
My Dad had a forklift repair shop and 

3367
02:30:21,931 --> 02:30:23,610
I'd have to fucking work there every 
summer.

3368
02:30:23,760 --> 02:30:26,130
And I remember starting at like 12 years
old.

3369
02:30:26,131 --> 02:30:26,964
I started listening to stern.
He was on the radio here in La in the 

3370
02:30:29,131 --> 02:30:29,964
mornings and I would be so bummed when 
those four hours were over and then I 

3371
02:30:32,281 --> 02:30:35,430
have to listen to whoever fucking 
dickhead was on after like whatever fake

3372
02:30:35,431 --> 02:30:39,450
nonsense radio and then like.
But Bango Fiesta came out.

3373
02:30:41,490 --> 02:30:43,680
That was the shit and they had like the,
you know,

3374
02:30:43,681 --> 02:30:47,100
the KKK guy.
A self was so.

3375
02:30:47,101 --> 02:30:48,930
It was so radical.
It was so funny.

3376
02:30:49,310 --> 02:30:52,200
Remember private parts,
of course I've seen it a million times.

3377
02:30:52,201 --> 02:30:53,700
Yeah.
You know to me too.

3378
02:30:53,701 --> 02:30:58,200
He also represented this fight against 
the suppressive free speech of the right

3379
02:30:58,201 --> 02:31:02,340
wing people that were empowered at the 
time because the FCC went after him in a

3380
02:31:02,341 --> 02:31:03,820
huge way.
They were finding Istation,

3381
02:31:04,020 --> 02:31:07,950
hundreds of thousands of dollars for 
doing like potty jokes or something like

3382
02:31:07,951 --> 02:31:09,380
that.
I am talking about penises.

3383
02:31:09,390 --> 02:31:10,223
Like they would attack them and like 
literally find them hundreds of 

3384
02:31:13,381 --> 02:31:14,214
thousands of dollars.
It was a direct assault on free speech 

3385
02:31:17,100 --> 02:31:18,900
because it wasn't even words.
They were,

3386
02:31:19,790 --> 02:31:20,070
wasn't

3387
02:31:20,070 --> 02:31:23,220
even forbidden words was like topics.
They were deciding what people could and

3388
02:31:23,221 --> 02:31:26,640
couldn't say,
and he was for all of us who are comics,

3389
02:31:26,820 --> 02:31:28,980
he was at the front of the line of that 
shit.

3390
02:31:29,250 --> 02:31:30,030
I mean,
he was,

3391
02:31:30,030 --> 02:31:34,640
he was the guy that was taking the hits 
and in a lot of ways it boosted them,

3392
02:31:34,790 --> 02:31:35,623
you know,
because everybody was aware that he was 

3393
02:31:37,080 --> 02:31:39,600
being attacked and people were outraged,
but it was,

3394
02:31:39,601 --> 02:31:43,230
it represented when Bush was in office,
when Bush was the president,

3395
02:31:43,440 --> 02:31:46,590
and we were all kind of freaked out by 
that this was happening,

3396
02:31:46,770 --> 02:31:47,603
you know,
this,

3397
02:31:47,880 --> 02:31:48,713
this guy who was this really funny guy.
They were deciding who was a criminal 

3398
02:31:52,050 --> 02:31:52,883
and they were finding his station,
hundreds of thousands of dollars for 

3399
02:31:55,381 --> 02:31:56,214
what?
For,

3400
02:31:56,550 --> 02:31:58,950
for making people laugh,
like so crazy.

3401
02:31:59,160 --> 02:32:02,010
Yeah.
So for me it just represented so much.

3402
02:32:02,011 --> 02:32:04,380
It was just so.
It was so crazy.

3403
02:32:04,381 --> 02:32:07,680
It was just.
That was the most nervous I've ever been

3404
02:32:07,710 --> 02:32:08,543
in my life the night before I did it and
actually I did yoga the night before I 

3405
02:32:12,511 --> 02:32:13,344
did it.
I did yoga in my hotel room to calm 

3406
02:32:14,251 --> 02:32:16,510
myself down and it worked.
Yeah,

3407
02:32:16,570 --> 02:32:17,200
yeah.
Super,

3408
02:32:17,200 --> 02:32:18,033
super calm

3409
02:32:18,060 --> 02:32:21,830
to the beat like I would love.
I would probably happen.

3410
02:32:22,080 --> 02:32:22,920
Um,
do,

3411
02:32:23,030 --> 02:32:23,520
do,
do,

3412
02:32:23,520 --> 02:32:24,420
do,
do,

3413
02:32:24,770 --> 02:32:25,603
do,
do,

3414
02:32:25,710 --> 02:32:26,820
do.
What about,

3415
02:32:27,170 --> 02:32:28,170
what was I gonna say?
Oh,

3416
02:32:28,171 --> 02:32:29,470
I forgot.
I forgot now.

3417
02:32:31,010 --> 02:32:32,340
I don't know.
Got Mommy brain.

3418
02:32:32,650 --> 02:32:35,520
I got mommy.
Brain is a real thing for sure.

3419
02:32:35,521 --> 02:32:38,370
Is it totally changed?
I don't sleep through the night anymore.

3420
02:32:38,430 --> 02:32:40,380
I wake up all night shift things too.
Right?

3421
02:32:40,381 --> 02:32:41,520
Like what?
What's going on for anything?

3422
02:32:41,530 --> 02:32:43,080
Okay.
I sense everything man.

3423
02:32:43,140 --> 02:32:45,510
My spidey senses are always on as a 
mother.

3424
02:32:45,860 --> 02:32:47,370
I imagine.
I don't know what's up.

3425
02:32:47,400 --> 02:32:49,110
Get a little human you made with your 
own body.

3426
02:32:49,410 --> 02:32:52,680
It's fucking bananas.
I don't know why women act like it's not

3427
02:32:52,681 --> 02:32:55,840
the biggest deal in the world.
It is the craziest thing in the world.

3428
02:32:55,890 --> 02:32:57,270
Women Act like it's not the biggest 
deal.

3429
02:32:57,330 --> 02:32:59,820
I feel like it's very normal for some 
people.

3430
02:32:59,830 --> 02:33:00,663
Like I just feel like I feel like we 
need to be like blown away by it 

3431
02:33:04,050 --> 02:33:06,090
constantly and we're just not blown away
by it enough.

3432
02:33:06,120 --> 02:33:06,770
Well,
you know what,

3433
02:33:06,770 --> 02:33:08,260
you don't have a,
you know,

3434
02:33:08,310 --> 02:33:09,870
50 hours a week,
day job,

3435
02:33:11,120 --> 02:33:13,140
Dick head for a husband.
You know what I mean?

3436
02:33:13,650 --> 02:33:17,040
Maybe that's why for those fucking kids 
to.

3437
02:33:17,150 --> 02:33:18,270
I guess I got to feed it.

3438
02:33:21,710 --> 02:33:22,543
I don't know.
I mean I think it was the experience is 

3439
02:33:23,791 --> 02:33:26,880
different depending on what kind of 
relationship you have with your partner,

3440
02:33:26,930 --> 02:33:27,763
you know?
Yeah,

3441
02:33:28,050 --> 02:33:28,883
definitely.
Sounds like you have a gay girl can say 

3442
02:33:32,250 --> 02:33:35,460
partner like a guy said that to me about
his girlfriend once.

3443
02:33:35,461 --> 02:33:36,001
Well,
you know,

3444
02:33:36,001 --> 02:33:37,770
me and my partner,
we've been living together for a while.

3445
02:33:37,771 --> 02:33:38,310
I'm like,
what?

3446
02:33:38,310 --> 02:33:40,000
Your partner partner.
That's what.

3447
02:33:40,170 --> 02:33:41,420
That's a homosexual.
Yeah.

3448
02:33:41,930 --> 02:33:42,763
Yeah.
Tom and Helen,

3449
02:33:42,830 --> 02:33:43,663
his wife,
his partner.

3450
02:33:44,360 --> 02:33:46,650
That's only for gays.
Partner in crime.

3451
02:33:46,651 --> 02:33:47,390
You guys,
criminals.

3452
02:33:47,390 --> 02:33:48,223
Liquidity here.
Your business partner we're talking 

3453
02:33:51,211 --> 02:33:52,044
about.
It was just such a weird way of 

3454
02:33:53,221 --> 02:33:54,054
describing it.
My partner Monroe for too close for 

3455
02:33:55,831 --> 02:33:57,570
comfort or put a strap on on you,
Bro.

3456
02:33:58,940 --> 02:34:01,200
We were watching as good as it gets last
night.

3457
02:34:01,380 --> 02:34:03,150
And Greg Kinnear,
those other things.

3458
02:34:03,180 --> 02:34:04,410
That movie.
Oh really?

3459
02:34:04,411 --> 02:34:05,550
I love it.
Angry.

3460
02:34:05,700 --> 02:34:07,550
Well part.
What made you angry as he,

3461
02:34:07,730 --> 02:34:09,810
because he's a racist,
I'm going to fix it with a pill,

3462
02:34:11,160 --> 02:34:11,993
but it was so fucking stupid.
Is it like she seemed like this really 

3463
02:34:14,521 --> 02:34:17,480
sweet woman who had a kid and Jack 
Nicholson was his old car.

3464
02:34:17,530 --> 02:34:18,070
That's as good

3465
02:34:18,070 --> 02:34:20,440
as it gets.
Like what kind of fucking messages after

3466
02:34:20,690 --> 02:34:24,760
Peter,
this is so stupid and the writing was so

3467
02:34:24,761 --> 02:34:25,540
dumb.
I was like,

3468
02:34:25,540 --> 02:34:26,373
Oh,
you're going to fix his racism with a 

3469
02:34:27,191 --> 02:34:30,850
pill or get the fuck out of here.
That is so stupid.

3470
02:34:31,580 --> 02:34:32,413
No,
I don't hate spicks like fuck off 

3471
02:34:36,040 --> 02:34:39,310
fucking stupid movie.
I hated that movie.

3472
02:34:39,820 --> 02:34:42,070
Like this poor lady.
She seemed so nice.

3473
02:34:42,340 --> 02:34:44,500
Like maybe find a nice guy.
I swear to you.

3474
02:34:45,240 --> 02:34:49,510
I never thought of it that way.
She just settles for this old Shitty,

3475
02:34:49,511 --> 02:34:53,380
racist repo who needs to take drugs to 
make him somewhat normal.

3476
02:34:53,770 --> 02:34:55,840
He takes drugs to make them not a 
racist.

3477
02:34:55,841 --> 02:34:56,674
It's the stupidest idea ever.
Any kind of manipulates her by sending 

3478
02:34:59,801 --> 02:35:01,900
the doctor over to care for her child.
She's.

3479
02:35:01,990 --> 02:35:03,700
She's a neat.
She has no money.

3480
02:35:03,780 --> 02:35:06,340
As good as it gets.
This is not as good as it gets.

3481
02:35:07,420 --> 02:35:08,620
Hang in there,
sweetie.

3482
02:35:09,730 --> 02:35:11,920
You can get better.
You could do a lot better.

3483
02:35:12,710 --> 02:35:15,700
A pretender.
Jack Nicholson.

3484
02:35:15,701 --> 02:35:17,730
She couldn't swipe right.
She couldn't ask why?

3485
02:35:17,770 --> 02:35:19,470
No,
there was no swiping magnetic.

3486
02:35:19,560 --> 02:35:21,790
Just got to find some other Nice Dad and
your.

3487
02:35:22,180 --> 02:35:23,013
Your kid gets along with their kid and 
you have another fucking brady bunch of 

3488
02:35:25,380 --> 02:35:30,170
for you.
That's the story of a man named Brandon.

3489
02:35:32,320 --> 02:35:33,550
What's her name?
Alice just died,

3490
02:35:33,551 --> 02:35:34,690
right?
Yeah.

3491
02:35:34,870 --> 02:35:37,210
Who's alive still?
Dad died of AIDS.

3492
02:35:37,640 --> 02:35:38,473
That was bananas.
Right in front of the dad was actually 

3493
02:35:40,510 --> 02:35:44,290
taken in the no idea I was wanting to 
meet Greg Kinnear,

3494
02:35:44,291 --> 02:35:45,124
his character.
His parents disowned him because he's 

3495
02:35:46,391 --> 02:35:49,510
gay and and last night Tom was like,
can you believe this shit?

3496
02:35:49,511 --> 02:35:51,760
This is like what?
Twenty years ago this was.

3497
02:35:51,880 --> 02:35:54,460
That was considered a thing that you 
would disown your child.

3498
02:35:54,461 --> 02:35:56,200
Yeah.
Now it still is a thing.

3499
02:35:56,220 --> 02:35:57,100
Yes,
it is.

3500
02:35:58,080 --> 02:35:58,450
Yeah,
yeah,

3501
02:35:58,450 --> 02:36:00,070
yeah.
South Dakota.

3502
02:36:00,071 --> 02:36:04,780
They fucking kill you.
Fuck you.

3503
02:36:04,810 --> 02:36:07,810
Rogan were normal.
No Internet.

3504
02:36:08,340 --> 02:36:09,460
I'm kidding.
Folks.

3505
02:36:09,520 --> 02:36:11,500
I run out of things to say they have a 
free ball.

3506
02:36:11,590 --> 02:36:15,580
They bow hunt the quiz.
The quiz.

3507
02:36:15,640 --> 02:36:16,480
Is that.
What'd you guys do?

3508
02:36:19,720 --> 02:36:20,980
Hunt the gaze.
No,

3509
02:36:20,981 --> 02:36:22,330
no.
The gays aren't edible.

3510
02:36:25,270 --> 02:36:29,980
The Queen.
Can you imagine?

3511
02:36:30,510 --> 02:36:33,280
I was reading this thing about cannibals
the.

3512
02:36:33,470 --> 02:36:36,970
I know it's a weird thing to say.
I guess you had to dance around you.

3513
02:36:36,971 --> 02:36:41,560
You couldn't be like my boyfriend.
My girlfriend knows his wife.

3514
02:36:41,910 --> 02:36:44,140
He was calling.
It was connor is partner.

3515
02:36:46,390 --> 02:36:48,040
People are so fucked up.
Well,

3516
02:36:48,041 --> 02:36:48,874
it's almost think that a guy like that 
is like so programmed by like liberal 

3517
02:36:52,601 --> 02:36:56,020
sensibilities that he's like,
he wants to put her on equal ground.

3518
02:36:56,080 --> 02:36:57,490
It's not my wife.
I don't own her.

3519
02:36:57,491 --> 02:36:59,830
She's my partner.
We're in this together.

3520
02:37:01,510 --> 02:37:05,020
Totally drinking the Koolaid.
Bitch made men.

3521
02:37:05,290 --> 02:37:10,290
There's so many just bitch made men out 
there that just wearing slippery shoes,

3522
02:37:10,530 --> 02:37:13,090
walking around with tight pants on and 
take a punch.

3523
02:37:13,520 --> 02:37:16,850
Just just barely getting through life 
early men.

3524
02:37:16,851 --> 02:37:17,930
They're barely men.
I,

3525
02:37:18,010 --> 02:37:20,000
you know,
it's so funny because Tommy yesterday he

3526
02:37:20,001 --> 02:37:20,810
goes,
you know Christina,

3527
02:37:20,810 --> 02:37:23,230
you're,
you're like in 19 thirties man,

3528
02:37:23,960 --> 02:37:28,960
so fucking well you know,
because I'm a little traditional.

3529
02:37:35,690 --> 02:37:37,970
I actually am very traditional about 
this kind of stuff.

3530
02:37:38,150 --> 02:37:38,983
Did look the truth of it is the fucking 
guy at wearing the string bracelets and 

3531
02:37:42,561 --> 02:37:46,570
the thumb ring and the pony tail and 
your shock alignment in the Reiki.

3532
02:37:46,780 --> 02:37:49,760
That's just a fucking thing for him to 
get laid at the end of the day.

3533
02:37:49,790 --> 02:37:51,980
He's just trying to convince you to fuck
him.

3534
02:37:52,100 --> 02:37:52,933
Well,
he's just trying to play the spiritual 

3535
02:37:54,381 --> 02:37:55,820
angle.
That's right.

3536
02:37:56,210 --> 02:37:57,043
That's his game.
This is what I was saying on stage last 

3537
02:37:58,790 --> 02:38:00,530
night.
You know I did Jeremiah walk and show.

3538
02:38:00,531 --> 02:38:02,330
You ever do that show too?
I hear it.

3539
02:38:02,331 --> 02:38:04,040
So fun.
Stand up on the spot.

3540
02:38:04,440 --> 02:38:06,020
Make up things.
People yell things out at you,

3541
02:38:06,320 --> 02:38:09,080
but one of the things I was saying,
we were talking about male feminists.

3542
02:38:09,140 --> 02:38:09,973
Somehow the subject came up and I was 
saying if you could give any one of 

3543
02:38:12,441 --> 02:38:15,470
those guys a pill that would turn them 
into that thor dude,

3544
02:38:15,530 --> 02:38:16,810
that Chris Hemsworth,
dude,

3545
02:38:16,820 --> 02:38:17,720
they would all take it.

3546
02:38:17,950 --> 02:38:21,260
Are The bond powerful?
And then didn't.

3547
02:38:21,261 --> 02:38:23,720
They would just be themselves.
They wouldn't have to.

3548
02:38:23,721 --> 02:38:24,554
Like I was talking about this tweet that
I read that literally made me want to 

3549
02:38:27,111 --> 02:38:29,000
punch my fist through the fucking 
laptop.

3550
02:38:29,630 --> 02:38:30,463
This guy said,
I'm not calling myself a feminist until 

3551
02:38:32,421 --> 02:38:34,340
women tell me I'm doing feminism 
correctly.

3552
02:38:35,850 --> 02:38:39,080
It's just like literally cutting off his
dick and offering it on a platter.

3553
02:38:39,081 --> 02:38:40,910
I don't need this.
I'm not about that.

3554
02:38:40,911 --> 02:38:42,260
I'm spiritual.
Well,

3555
02:38:42,290 --> 02:38:43,700
and here's the truth.
I mean,

3556
02:38:43,701 --> 02:38:44,534
at least for me,
I appreciate when a man is down for the 

3557
02:38:46,911 --> 02:38:47,860
cause.
Like I,

3558
02:38:47,861 --> 02:38:50,990
I get that,
but it's not sexually.

3559
02:38:51,020 --> 02:38:54,320
It's not attractive to data.
A guy that's like a girl.

3560
02:38:54,350 --> 02:38:56,090
For me personally,
I like,

3561
02:38:56,390 --> 02:38:59,790
I like men.
It totally 100 percent sexist.

3562
02:38:59,990 --> 02:39:00,950
Yeah.
Probably.

3563
02:39:00,951 --> 02:39:03,290
I don't know.
When I answered girl be sexist.

3564
02:39:03,440 --> 02:39:06,740
I don't even know.
I feel like it's okay for a girl to want

3565
02:39:07,190 --> 02:39:08,660
a traditional gender roles.

3566
02:39:08,720 --> 02:39:10,910
It's very suppressive if a guy wants 
them.

3567
02:39:11,030 --> 02:39:12,860
That's the thought process.
Oh,

3568
02:39:12,861 --> 02:39:13,521
I see you're saying?
Yeah,

3569
02:39:13,521 --> 02:39:17,180
because we have the option to be like 
the stay at home mom or the career lady.

3570
02:39:17,330 --> 02:39:20,390
But if you want like a guide to be a 
man,

3571
02:39:20,600 --> 02:39:21,433
that's okay.
But if I like a woman to just shut the 

3572
02:39:23,301 --> 02:39:25,340
fuck up,
let's be banger.

3573
02:39:25,930 --> 02:39:27,320
People like what?
Right.

3574
02:39:27,350 --> 02:39:28,560
You're considered?
Yeah.

3575
02:39:28,960 --> 02:39:32,660
Say I like a guy who just grabs you by 
my here and fucked my mouth.

3576
02:39:33,140 --> 02:39:33,890
You're like,
whoa.

3577
02:39:33,890 --> 02:39:34,280
You're like,
well,

3578
02:39:34,280 --> 02:39:37,310
she's so empowered.
Wow.

3579
02:39:37,311 --> 02:39:40,100
There's a lady that she's a slut.
Shamed.

3580
02:39:40,530 --> 02:39:41,960
Yeah.
She can be herself.

3581
02:39:42,200 --> 02:39:43,250
I don't know.
I don't know.

3582
02:39:43,251 --> 02:39:44,210
I don't know.
You know what?

3583
02:39:44,211 --> 02:39:45,890
I don't know.
I think I just,

3584
02:39:45,891 --> 02:39:46,724
all of our issues stem the real issue.
All of our issues stem from actual 

3585
02:39:49,851 --> 02:39:52,490
sexism,
actual discrimination.

3586
02:39:52,760 --> 02:39:54,740
If,
if we didn't have that,

3587
02:39:54,960 --> 02:39:55,793
if we just had people judge by on the 
merits of their behavior and their 

3588
02:39:59,331 --> 02:40:04,190
character and what they're capable of 
and we would just look like this.

3589
02:40:04,190 --> 02:40:06,050
One of the things about the standup 
comedy world,

3590
02:40:06,051 --> 02:40:06,884
like maybe audience members like you,
I mean you would be able to tell much 

3591
02:40:09,291 --> 02:40:11,470
more than I would that they,
you know,

3592
02:40:11,630 --> 02:40:14,520
I definitely think that some guys see a 
girl go up and they go,

3593
02:40:14,521 --> 02:40:17,070
oh,
we'll shoot for me.

3594
02:40:17,250 --> 02:40:20,100
Right.
That was the whole environment I came up

3595
02:40:20,101 --> 02:40:21,540
in.
For sure arms folded.

3596
02:40:21,780 --> 02:40:23,390
Fuck is this girl,
I refine it.

3597
02:40:23,400 --> 02:40:24,630
Great.
How long is she up for?

3598
02:40:24,631 --> 02:40:25,464
Fifteen minutes.
We took a post 100 percent go to the 

3599
02:40:27,390 --> 02:40:28,223
bar,
but in the world of comics it's very 

3600
02:40:32,581 --> 02:40:35,670
egalitarian if you kill you or you're a 
comic,

3601
02:40:35,730 --> 02:40:36,720
right?
Like nobody.

3602
02:40:36,750 --> 02:40:37,583
None of that.
Nobody in the comedy world looks at Ali 

3603
02:40:39,240 --> 02:40:41,730
Wong as a girl.
She's amazing.

3604
02:40:41,790 --> 02:40:43,590
She's just a comic.
She's,

3605
02:40:43,620 --> 02:40:45,550
she happens to be a girl,
but she's,

3606
02:40:45,570 --> 02:40:47,500
she's just a killer.
Right?

3607
02:40:47,580 --> 02:40:48,640
That's how everybody looks at her.

3608
02:40:48,840 --> 02:40:51,240
Like there's like,
there's like a thing,

3609
02:40:51,270 --> 02:40:55,230
there's like a level of the video game 
that you get to where you slot into,

3610
02:40:55,260 --> 02:40:56,910
oh,
this is a peer,

3611
02:40:57,150 --> 02:40:58,830
like she's a killer.
You know?

3612
02:40:59,270 --> 02:41:00,103
And that's,
that's an interesting thing about the 

3613
02:41:01,021 --> 02:41:02,760
world of comedy.
Like when you're a killer,

3614
02:41:03,000 --> 02:41:03,833
people think of you as a killer.
It doesn't matter if you have a vagina 

3615
02:41:05,821 --> 02:41:07,650
or a penis,
if you're gay or you're straight.

3616
02:41:07,980 --> 02:41:09,300
If you're murdering it,
you're,

3617
02:41:09,370 --> 02:41:11,040
you're in that group.
Right?

3618
02:41:11,041 --> 02:41:13,290
It's the great leveler.
It.

3619
02:41:13,390 --> 02:41:14,490
Yeah,
it's a very,

3620
02:41:14,580 --> 02:41:15,540
it's very true.
Yeah,

3621
02:41:15,541 --> 02:41:18,510
because nobody can hold your hand for 
you once you get up there.

3622
02:41:18,530 --> 02:41:18,980
No,
no,

3623
02:41:18,980 --> 02:41:19,830
and it's,
it's a,

3624
02:41:19,831 --> 02:41:20,664
it's a very ballsy thing to do and 
either you fail and you fail or you 

3625
02:41:23,851 --> 02:41:25,020
succeed and you succeed.
Heart,

3626
02:41:25,021 --> 02:41:27,570
there's no,
there's no middle ground,

3627
02:41:27,600 --> 02:41:28,433
but I definitely think women have a way 
harder go at it because I think that 

3628
02:41:31,531 --> 02:41:34,680
sexual topics that you either are the 
slut,

3629
02:41:34,710 --> 02:41:37,410
like you were saying before or they're 
weird,

3630
02:41:37,870 --> 02:41:38,130
right?

3631
02:41:38,130 --> 02:41:38,963
Because if you're just a regular woman 
and you're talking to these strangers 

3632
02:41:41,610 --> 02:41:42,443
about like how you like your asshole 
licked and you're really embarrassed 

3633
02:41:44,671 --> 02:41:45,271
about it.
People are like,

3634
02:41:45,271 --> 02:41:46,730
what the fuck?
You know,

3635
02:41:46,740 --> 02:41:48,960
and girls will get mad at you.
If you're attractive.

3636
02:41:48,961 --> 02:41:51,390
Girls get mad at you because you're 
their husbands laughing.

3637
02:41:51,391 --> 02:41:53,390
Like that's funny.
She's reps,

3638
02:41:53,610 --> 02:41:54,443
she's disgusting.
And then politics are almost off level 

3639
02:41:57,720 --> 02:41:58,670
for you.
I mean,

3640
02:41:58,680 --> 02:42:01,810
people get mad at you,
they will get mad at you if you like.

3641
02:42:01,860 --> 02:42:02,693
You're a trump supporter and you're a 
woman and you're on stage and there's a 

3642
02:42:05,911 --> 02:42:07,800
bunch of people in the audience.
There are liberals.

3643
02:42:07,801 --> 02:42:10,230
They'll get mad.
Forget you're a liberal onstage and this

3644
02:42:10,231 --> 02:42:12,420
trump supporters in the audience and you
start shitting on trump.

3645
02:42:12,600 --> 02:42:16,580
They'll get mad at you.
Stick to the job with depaul jokes,

3646
02:42:16,800 --> 02:42:18,430
the jokes.
Well,

3647
02:42:18,530 --> 02:42:22,140
what I've noticed is that at least 
here's my thing,

3648
02:42:22,260 --> 02:42:23,220
I have hope for this.

3649
02:42:23,610 --> 02:42:24,443
The millennials,
I think they're changing how comedy is 

3650
02:42:26,881 --> 02:42:29,220
consumed.
The podcasting world.

3651
02:42:29,250 --> 02:42:30,990
It's millennials,
the early adapters,

3652
02:42:31,680 --> 02:42:33,690
and they grew up watching Sarah 
Silverman,

3653
02:42:33,750 --> 02:42:36,630
Lisa Lampanelli,
all these motherfucking bad bitches.

3654
02:42:36,750 --> 02:42:38,760
So now in the millennial comes to a 
shell.

3655
02:42:38,880 --> 02:42:39,713
That 20 year old boy doesn't have the 
same bias that the men who I started in 

3656
02:42:43,441 --> 02:42:45,450
front of a hat.
You know what I mean?

3657
02:42:45,660 --> 02:42:49,260
It's a given that if a woman is a comic,
now it's cooler.

3658
02:42:49,261 --> 02:42:51,130
It's way different.
Well,

3659
02:42:51,131 --> 02:42:54,330
don't you think there's,
I like to think I'm not a millennial,

3660
02:42:54,331 --> 02:42:56,010
but I'd like to think there's less 
sexism.

3661
02:42:56,300 --> 02:42:58,170
Yeah,
no less accepted.

3662
02:42:58,440 --> 02:42:59,101
Yeah.
I mean,

3663
02:42:59,101 --> 02:42:59,934
when I started featuring,
I literally called the club in the 

3664
02:43:02,101 --> 02:43:04,540
Midwest and I was on Chelsea lately.
I go,

3665
02:43:04,570 --> 02:43:05,101
okay,
can I,

3666
02:43:05,101 --> 02:43:07,800
uh,
can I dear room kind of headline or even

3667
02:43:07,801 --> 02:43:09,180
just feature no feature.
Well,

3668
02:43:09,181 --> 02:43:10,014
you know,
Christina have already booked to women 

3669
02:43:10,831 --> 02:43:12,280
this.
Whoa.

3670
02:43:13,060 --> 02:43:14,070
Yeah.
Whole year,

3671
02:43:14,110 --> 02:43:16,570
the whole year guys,
that's 52 weeks.

3672
02:43:16,571 --> 02:43:17,410
50 of them.
Yeah.

3673
02:43:17,411 --> 02:43:18,610
And uh,
and I was like,

3674
02:43:18,611 --> 02:43:19,444
wow,
I'll never under your fucking club 

3675
02:43:19,931 --> 02:43:21,040
again.
But you know,

3676
02:43:21,041 --> 02:43:24,340
I heard shit like that the whole time 
coming in book two women.

3677
02:43:24,341 --> 02:43:27,730
Imagine if that was a guy.
Oh my gosh guys,

3678
02:43:27,810 --> 02:43:32,800
was that hard to get into comedy already
booked two dudes was only,

3679
02:43:32,801 --> 02:43:34,630
have so many swinging dicks.
No,

3680
02:43:34,870 --> 02:43:37,550
but you know,
but that feminism shit and I,

3681
02:43:37,930 --> 02:43:41,200
I try not to look at the,
the problems of the world.

3682
02:43:41,380 --> 02:43:44,500
I try to fucking transcendent like I 
can't even spell.

3683
02:43:44,640 --> 02:43:45,473
I used to be so much angrier at feminism
and all this shit when I was in my 

3684
02:43:47,051 --> 02:43:49,300
thirties and then I now I'm just like,
you know what?

3685
02:43:49,301 --> 02:43:52,330
I don't give a shit.
I don't care what society wants me to be

3686
02:43:52,540 --> 02:43:54,730
or what the fucking rules are.
I don't care.

3687
02:43:54,790 --> 02:43:59,020
Fuck you at life is too short for me to 
even worry about what this person thinks

3688
02:43:59,021 --> 02:44:00,220
or the society is thinking.

3689
02:44:00,350 --> 02:44:01,790
Well,
I think that like what you're seeing,

3690
02:44:01,791 --> 02:44:04,730
like on college campuses where people 
are super radical,

3691
02:44:04,731 --> 02:44:05,564
left wing progressive as in I think 
you're seeing that with young people as 

3692
02:44:08,601 --> 02:44:09,434
well.
I think people are just trying to work 

3693
02:44:10,371 --> 02:44:12,360
out the world,
you know,

3694
02:44:12,410 --> 02:44:17,410
and sometimes they work out the world by
assuming some sort of a behavior pattern

3695
02:44:18,360 --> 02:44:19,193
in that behavior pattern.
Could be right wing or it could be left 

3696
02:44:21,021 --> 02:44:22,730
wing.
I mean it can be feminist,

3697
02:44:22,731 --> 02:44:23,830
it could be,
you know,

3698
02:44:23,870 --> 02:44:25,370
whatever.
That could be gender queer.

3699
02:44:25,371 --> 02:44:27,980
They'll try that out for awhile.
I'm going to shave half my head and wear

3700
02:44:27,981 --> 02:44:28,814
a nose ring and say fuck cis gendered 
men and people get weird and they just 

3701
02:44:34,280 --> 02:44:37,030
assume these patterns and try them out 
for awhile.

3702
02:44:37,040 --> 02:44:38,770
Almost like dressing punk rock,
you know,

3703
02:44:39,170 --> 02:44:41,420
start wearing doc martins.
Ruin your jeans up.

3704
02:44:42,690 --> 02:44:44,800
That was really good at that.
Did you do that?

3705
02:44:44,840 --> 02:44:46,390
My Lane.
I was punk as fuck.

3706
02:44:47,000 --> 02:44:49,840
Goth and punk for any weird piercings in
the face.

3707
02:44:50,160 --> 02:44:52,780
The nose or the lips.
No,

3708
02:44:52,781 --> 02:44:53,614
I know.
I was too sensible because I knew that 

3709
02:44:55,001 --> 02:44:57,010
I'd have a hole in my face.
Woo.

3710
02:44:57,020 --> 02:44:59,590
You're always so controlled.
Yeah.

3711
02:44:59,740 --> 02:45:00,573
I only have one shitty tattoo.
I got a tramp stamp in the nineties on 

3712
02:45:02,741 --> 02:45:03,574
road rules.
Woo.

3713
02:45:03,690 --> 02:45:04,523
Yeah.
Do you think that that control things 

3714
02:45:07,180 --> 02:45:09,220
because your mom was nuts?
Yeah.

3715
02:45:09,700 --> 02:45:11,770
Yeah.
My world was out of control,

3716
02:45:11,771 --> 02:45:14,590
so I was like,
I have to be responsible.

3717
02:45:14,591 --> 02:45:18,700
I was the one that was responsible from 
the time I was a little little kid.

3718
02:45:18,880 --> 02:45:19,880
I grew up fast.
Right.

3719
02:45:19,890 --> 02:45:21,560
That makes sense.
Parentified child,

3720
02:45:21,561 --> 02:45:24,550
as I said,
isn't that

3721
02:45:25,150 --> 02:45:26,280
so?
You find that a lot.

3722
02:45:26,330 --> 02:45:28,800
It's interesting.
It's like I have this dilemma.

3723
02:45:28,801 --> 02:45:31,890
I've talked about this with Bryan County
as a lot of my friends that are dads.

3724
02:45:32,010 --> 02:45:36,510
It's like all my interesting friends 
came from fucked up childhoods,

3725
02:45:36,780 --> 02:45:39,030
but I don't want that for my kids knew.
Right.

3726
02:45:39,031 --> 02:45:41,850
So what is that like?
All my favorite people came from

3727
02:45:42,780 --> 02:45:45,290
childhoods game.
Recognize game son.

3728
02:45:45,530 --> 02:45:46,890
You know what I'm saying?
Yeah,

3729
02:45:46,910 --> 02:45:49,880
but it's because your,
your wires or whatever.

3730
02:45:49,881 --> 02:45:52,370
Crossed a certain way.
Same way similarly,

3731
02:45:52,580 --> 02:45:54,490
but you don't want to fuck up your can.
I have the same dilemma.

3732
02:45:54,510 --> 02:45:55,700
Believe me,
I don't want my son.

3733
02:45:55,910 --> 02:45:56,743
Then again,
I'd be super thrilled with my son grew 

3734
02:45:57,771 --> 02:45:58,880
up and was like,
I'd love,

3735
02:45:58,920 --> 02:46:00,980
I'm going to be an accountant,
I'm just going to be normal.

3736
02:46:02,030 --> 02:46:03,580
I don't want him to be in show business.
Like,

3737
02:46:03,590 --> 02:46:05,480
this is the,
this is craziness.

3738
02:46:06,380 --> 02:46:09,980
This business is not for normal people.
Especially Avenue that you've

3739
02:46:09,980 --> 02:46:11,600
carved standup.
Yeah,

3740
02:46:12,170 --> 02:46:13,003
yeah,
yeah.

3741
02:46:13,630 --> 02:46:15,950
We've carved horrible.
It's crazy.

3742
02:46:16,010 --> 02:46:17,720
It's bananas and I,
I was just,

3743
02:46:17,750 --> 02:46:18,583
I mean when I look back on who we 
started with like 14 years ago and the 

3744
02:46:21,921 --> 02:46:25,040
attrition rate,
I mean there's no real,

3745
02:46:25,190 --> 02:46:27,500
it's just bananas that we can even make 
a living at this.

3746
02:46:27,520 --> 02:46:31,210
Like there's no reason I should be what 
I'm saying.

3747
02:46:32,120 --> 02:46:33,450
It's crazy.
Well,

3748
02:46:33,460 --> 02:46:34,430
it's one thing that,
you know,

3749
02:46:34,431 --> 02:46:39,431
you start off and you suck and you keep 
working at it and suck less and then you

3750
02:46:40,101 --> 02:46:43,730
start getting laughs and he started 
doing better when they start working and

3751
02:46:43,770 --> 02:46:44,603
you keep building and keep moving as 
long as you keep moving and sometimes 

3752
02:46:46,851 --> 02:46:47,684
you'll have some setbacks.
Like probably you when you were doing 

3753
02:46:48,651 --> 02:46:51,890
Chelsea lately and me when I was doing 
news radio and you know,

3754
02:46:51,930 --> 02:46:54,860
and you just,
if you can get back on the horse,

3755
02:46:54,950 --> 02:46:56,480
get back moving.
Yeah,

3756
02:46:56,540 --> 02:46:59,780
you can pick it up and next thing you 
know you've got a motherfucking Netflix.

3757
02:47:06,660 --> 02:47:07,493
It's available right now and we'll wrap 
it up with this mother and fear 

3758
02:47:10,820 --> 02:47:12,440
available for screaming,
screaming,

3759
02:47:12,530 --> 02:47:15,410
screaming,
and streaming both right now.

3760
02:47:15,660 --> 02:47:17,800
God dammit,
Christina Pezeshki,

3761
02:47:17,810 --> 02:47:18,643
ladies and gentlemen,
and make sure you watch and listen to 

3762
02:47:21,081 --> 02:47:22,910
your mom's house.
Fantastic podcasts.

3763
02:47:23,630 --> 02:47:25,400
And uh,
let's do this more often.

3764
02:47:25,430 --> 02:47:28,210
Thank you so much for having me.
Thank you.

3765
02:47:28,211 --> 02:47:29,840
I enjoyed it too.
All right folks.

3766
02:47:30,080 --> 02:47:31,120
We'll see you soon.
Bye.
