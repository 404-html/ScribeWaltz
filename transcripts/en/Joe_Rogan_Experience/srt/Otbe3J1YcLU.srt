1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,370
Four three,
two,

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:04,020
one.
Boom.

3
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:06,420
Matt,
you're the first guy to ever bring

4
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:08,850
homemade cold brew.
Yes,

5
00:00:08,851 --> 00:00:09,810
sir.
To the studio.

6
00:00:09,811 --> 00:00:11,360
I think we should enjoy some.
Okay,

7
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:13,230
let's absence.
Yeah,

8
00:00:13,231 --> 00:00:14,190
it's uh,
it's,

9
00:00:14,191 --> 00:00:15,960
it's,
it's pretty much kerosene.

10
00:00:15,961 --> 00:00:17,340
So you want to sip it,
be careful.

11
00:00:17,341 --> 00:00:18,240
I usually,
yeah,

12
00:00:18,241 --> 00:00:19,980
I usually dilute it with a little bit of
water.

13
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:21,360
Wow.
Yeah.

14
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:25,530
I got this off out about this guy.
It's a company called [inaudible] where

15
00:00:25,531 --> 00:00:28,500
it's a guy and he just wrote this,
all these beans from all over the world

16
00:00:28,501 --> 00:00:33,060
and drops him off at this one bicycle
cafe and a Venice or something.

17
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:33,571
No,
no.

18
00:00:33,571 --> 00:00:35,010
I live in Los Feliz.
Close.

19
00:00:35,011 --> 00:00:35,930
Close second.
No.

20
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:37,290
Cheers Buddy.
Thanks for having me.

21
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:42,230
My pleasure.
I had a coffee expert on the podcast

22
00:00:42,231 --> 00:00:43,730
before.
Just start it.

23
00:00:43,731 --> 00:00:45,410
I mean,
I don't know anything about coughing

24
00:00:45,411 --> 00:00:47,930
just out on a whim because of this Guy
Peter Juliano.

25
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:50,570
That's his name.
Juliano or Giuliani.

26
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:53,000
I'm avoiding,

27
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,120
uh,
the word Giuliani,

28
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:59,310
like specific Juliano Juliano.
Yeah,

29
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:00,163
yeah,
yeah.

30
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:02,140
But he's the,
like a legit coffee expert.

31
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:04,930
He's explained to us that all coffee
comes from Ethiopia.

32
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:06,370
Oh really?
Yeah.

33
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:08,020
All of it came out of there.
That's,

34
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:10,240
that's the root originated it.
Oh,

35
00:01:10,241 --> 00:01:12,550
okay.
And then they started growing it and

36
00:01:12,551 --> 00:01:14,530
Latin American countries and all over
the other place.

37
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:15,250
Yeah.
Colombian.

38
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:16,420
You know,
we're always as a kid,

39
00:01:16,421 --> 00:01:19,330
Colombian coffee was the course saying
like Juan Valdez.

40
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:20,630
Yeah.
He's still at,

41
00:01:20,631 --> 00:01:22,810
we,
I went to Columbia over the summer and

42
00:01:22,811 --> 00:01:24,700
uh,
you still see pictures and drawings of

43
00:01:24,701 --> 00:01:25,810
him everywhere cause they were like,
yeah,

44
00:01:25,811 --> 00:01:30,250
because he brought kind of fame to
Columbia and differentiated it from out

45
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:32,610
the other South American countries.
Yeah.

46
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:34,870
Well this guy was,
it was really fun.

47
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,540
This is actually a very good cold.
Oh,

48
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:37,660
cool.
Very tasty.

49
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:38,590
Nice,
interesting.

50
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:39,720
It's a different flavor.
Yeah.

51
00:01:39,721 --> 00:01:41,080
I mean it get cold brew coffee.

52
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:45,480
You take at least 70% of the bitterness
out and it makes it smoother and it just

53
00:01:45,481 --> 00:01:49,720
no acidic and you don't get that.
That's the stomach sourness you get when

54
00:01:49,721 --> 00:01:53,170
you drink a big pot of hot coffee.
I usually don't get that.

55
00:01:53,171 --> 00:01:56,080
I'm okay with coffee,
but I do like the flavor of this.

56
00:01:56,081 --> 00:01:57,120
This is really good.
Okay.

57
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:59,520
This is Ethiopian.
Yeah.

58
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:01,030
I just,
I'm no expert.

59
00:02:01,031 --> 00:02:02,890
I just go,
what's the best one to make cold brew?

60
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,960
And they pointed a bag and I buy it and
that's all,

61
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:06,160
you know,
smart.

62
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:10,150
Just defer to experts.
That's kind of the key to life I think.

63
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:14,380
But he was Giuliani Juliano Juliano
sorry Peter.

64
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:18,970
He was explaining to us that um,
the reason why they all have these

65
00:02:18,971 --> 00:02:23,260
different complex flavors and how they,
how they would take care of the beans

66
00:02:23,261 --> 00:02:27,070
because Ethiopia is a very dry climate
where South America is very hot.

67
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:29,890
So they developed all these problems
with a coffee,

68
00:02:29,891 --> 00:02:31,500
rust.
Have you ever heard of coffee rust?

69
00:02:31,501 --> 00:02:32,340
Yeah.
Yeah.

70
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:35,620
They develop like weird molds and stuff.
That's why they had to figure out

71
00:02:35,621 --> 00:02:39,640
different ways of processing and wet
processing is verse to just leaving them

72
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:41,410
out and drying them.
Oh Wow.

73
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:44,100
Yeah.
Did he talk about the illegality of

74
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:47,020
coffee and it's kind of earlier stages
when it would go out into different

75
00:02:47,021 --> 00:02:48,820
regions and cultures and religious
areas?

76
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:51,370
Well,
bordain actually was the first person to

77
00:02:51,371 --> 00:02:56,260
tell me that they were outlawing coffee
shops and coffee houses back in the day.

78
00:02:56,261 --> 00:03:01,261
See there's a clip somewhere online of
bordain explaining to us how coffee

79
00:03:01,991 --> 00:03:06,991
shops were being outlawed because at the
time everyone basically was drunk all

80
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:07,750
day,
right.

81
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,190
Because people just,
they,

82
00:03:09,191 --> 00:03:11,560
all they did was drink booze because you
know,

83
00:03:11,561 --> 00:03:16,000
a lot of times if you had water sitting
around that water would probably have

84
00:03:16,001 --> 00:03:19,450
some funky shit and it was still water
and you'd get sick drinking it.

85
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:21,130
But you could be,
you know,

86
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,830
if water or the alcohol in it,
you wouldn't get sick.

87
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:28,050
It's a preservative.
Monks would only drink beer and like

88
00:03:28,051 --> 00:03:29,020
crazy.
It's not,

89
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:31,780
I can't imagine if you've ever had like
Belgian Ale.

90
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:33,370
It's like I have three,
I'm just like,

91
00:03:33,371 --> 00:03:34,390
fuck.
Okay.

92
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:37,030
Jesus.
And you'd think those guys just pacing

93
00:03:37,031 --> 00:03:39,360
themselves all day to stay somewhat
hydrated.

94
00:03:39,361 --> 00:03:43,360
And I think they just got used to it,
but it must have been terrible for their

95
00:03:43,361 --> 00:03:43,990
bodies.
I,

96
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:44,890
yeah,
that's what I was thinking.

97
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:45,461
It's like,
oh,

98
00:03:45,461 --> 00:03:48,000
I was just thinking about like life
expectancy and how like,

99
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,750
ah,
now I feel like we're going to see

100
00:03:49,751 --> 00:03:52,900
people living well into their hundreds
and stuff and like our generation and

101
00:03:52,901 --> 00:03:53,950
younger.
Uh,

102
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,690
but back then you're just like,
you're 30.

103
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,100
Alright,
you should make a whale man,

104
00:03:57,130 --> 00:03:59,170
because it's,
well,

105
00:03:59,171 --> 00:04:01,480
it's just if anything went wrong you
were done.

106
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:04,630
Where it's like I have a lot of friends
that have had their appendix taken out

107
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:07,780
or they broke a leg hiking.
They managed to get okay.

108
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:10,810
You know what I mean?
Like the back end that was the wolves

109
00:04:10,811 --> 00:04:14,920
ate you lays leave you so the wolves
don't come after the rest of us and just

110
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,780
take one for the team.
If your appendix,

111
00:04:16,781 --> 00:04:18,750
when you were just possessed by demons
know,

112
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:20,140
know what the fuck happened.
Yeah.

113
00:04:20,141 --> 00:04:23,230
You just struck dumb,
like just fall down and just rotted out

114
00:04:23,231 --> 00:04:26,110
from the inside and no one knew why it
and the amount of,

115
00:04:26,111 --> 00:04:28,140
the amount of,
I've heard this statistic that like

116
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:33,240
something like 80% of medieval land land
battles were fought drunk or something,

117
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,580
something,
some insane ratio.

118
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:38,440
They like,
of course it wouldn't have to be.

119
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:39,910
Yeah,
I would.

120
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:43,480
I would have to shotgun a bottle of Jack
to pick up like a battle ax and just run

121
00:04:43,481 --> 00:04:45,610
into a crowd of guys and just start
swinging away.

122
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:49,600
Well,
the vikings were famous for waging war

123
00:04:49,601 --> 00:04:53,320
while they were on mushrooms though
would eat siliciden mushrooms and just

124
00:04:53,321 --> 00:04:56,440
fucking go banana may Emma Nita Mascara
too,

125
00:04:56,441 --> 00:05:00,370
I think was the other mushroom that they
ate and they would just go fucking crazy

126
00:05:00,371 --> 00:05:02,560
with axes while they were,
who knows what they were saying.

127
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:04,690
He would say that the legend of the
Berserker.

128
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,760
Yeah.
Where are we at the term Berzerk from?

129
00:05:06,761 --> 00:05:08,600
You're obviously familiar and you're a,
you're a warrior,

130
00:05:08,601 --> 00:05:10,210
a philosopher,
so you know that is,

131
00:05:10,211 --> 00:05:10,860
but like,
yeah,

132
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:14,200
that's probably what you just go into a
trance and you're just killing

133
00:05:14,201 --> 00:05:16,450
everything in sight and you're basically
like a,

134
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:19,390
an insect on cocaine.
It's just chopping everything down

135
00:05:19,391 --> 00:05:20,111
around you.
Yeah.

136
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:24,070
You remember when we were talking about
that new Viking show that's on Netflix?

137
00:05:24,071 --> 00:05:26,140
We missed it.
It wasn't the comedy one.

138
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:28,450
There's another one.
There's another one that's like a

139
00:05:28,451 --> 00:05:33,451
serious viking show on Netflix that's
supposed to be like the show vikings,

140
00:05:33,581 --> 00:05:36,340
but way better,
which I kinda liked the show vikings.

141
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:36,881
Yeah.
It was good.

142
00:05:36,881 --> 00:05:37,720
You're good.
It was good.

143
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:39,220
I thought.
It's funny though,

144
00:05:39,221 --> 00:05:40,054
how,
uh,

145
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:43,510
you don't image the last kingdom that's
asking the last I heard.

146
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:45,850
That's amazing.
Where I'm so,

147
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:46,681
you know,
we,

148
00:05:46,681 --> 00:05:47,260
we,
we,

149
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:49,590
we focus on one thing and where it's
like you'd look,

150
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:50,590
you're the vikings,
you're like,

151
00:05:50,591 --> 00:05:52,780
where are the hats?
Where they wear the helmets with horns,

152
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:57,140
with all these braids everyone has,
I think he's a normal pizza.

153
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:58,331
They all,
they,

154
00:05:58,331 --> 00:06:01,370
they should all be monsters,
but it's like vikings were all sizes,

155
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:02,451
right?
Well,

156
00:06:02,451 --> 00:06:05,380
they were all big like this.
The problem is like,

157
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:08,930
there's not that many giant actors
unless you want to recruit football

158
00:06:08,931 --> 00:06:10,440
players.
It's so true,

159
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:11,420
you know?
Yeah.

160
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:14,150
But if you go to Holland or something
like that and one of the things you walk

161
00:06:14,151 --> 00:06:14,460
right,
you go,

162
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:15,680
God damn,
everyone's big.

163
00:06:15,681 --> 00:06:16,520
That's a good point.

164
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,380
Yeah.
Uh,

165
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:18,680
in a,
in Norway,

166
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:20,810
Norwegian countries,
they're very tall.

167
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:24,380
The median height is like six feet,
which is insane.

168
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:27,290
Well,
Iceland has a disproportionate number of

169
00:06:27,291 --> 00:06:29,480
strong men,
competition winners.

170
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:31,880
Those guys who were the strongest man in
the world,

171
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:33,043
you know,
let's do this.

172
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,730
Thrill barrels,
cars hop.

173
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:35,380
I love.
Yeah,

174
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:35,910
yeah,
yeah.

175
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:38,120
Those guys,
a lot of those guys come from Iceland.

176
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:42,140
Well the guy who plays the mountain,
he who took strong commander in the

177
00:06:42,141 --> 00:06:44,360
world title,
he's from Iceland.

178
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:49,420
He for sure is he is fucking you.
Like if you saw that guy coming over a

179
00:06:49,941 --> 00:06:52,060
hill on a horse with a sword,
like,

180
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:54,060
aw fuck,
it's over day.

181
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:57,140
Yeah,
this is the day we stop existing it.

182
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,570
We're done.
This is day my clan gets wiped out.

183
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,750
Or that thing where they to save to save
lives.

184
00:07:02,751 --> 00:07:04,670
They'd be like,
our champion fights your champion.

185
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,640
And then that person wins and then that
guy comes out and you're like,

186
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:09,260
ah,
fuck.

187
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:11,270
I was so good back in the,
in the,

188
00:07:11,271 --> 00:07:13,820
in the knife Jim that we train in.
But this guy,

189
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:16,410
well that was the saddest part about
game of thrones is the,

190
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:21,420
that uh,
the cocky bisexual Guy [inaudible] the

191
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:22,400
Red Viper.
He was ahead.

192
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:25,430
I dude,
I was broken up with my,

193
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:30,490
my now wife and just was just back from
a weekend on the road and was tongue

194
00:07:30,621 --> 00:07:31,780
over and was just like,
oh,

195
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:34,430
watch game of thrones.
And I just tweeted like,

196
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:35,660
ag,
I'll watch the,

197
00:07:35,661 --> 00:07:37,040
I still have it.
Don't tell him what happens,

198
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:37,371
you know,
blah,

199
00:07:37,371 --> 00:07:38,060
blah,
blah.

200
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,920
Just to,
just to have some connection with the

201
00:07:39,921 --> 00:07:42,380
outside world in my one bedroom
apartment.

202
00:07:42,381 --> 00:07:44,860
And I watch people like,
don't watch it alone.

203
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:45,361
I was like,
well,

204
00:07:45,361 --> 00:07:49,040
and I watch it and it just ruined me
because it's so fucked up.

205
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:52,460
He's screaming how you're raped his
sister and he's crushing head.

206
00:07:52,461 --> 00:07:54,470
And I'm just like,
aw man.

207
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:57,590
The way he did it too,
he just grabbed his head and killed him.

208
00:07:57,591 --> 00:07:59,360
Like you would kill a chipmunk or
something.

209
00:07:59,361 --> 00:08:02,030
The worst death.
And I've probably seen on screen and

210
00:08:02,031 --> 00:08:05,210
I've seen a lot of bad,
horrible screaming deaths,

211
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:08,140
you know,
like it was worse than like the guy and

212
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:10,070
saving private Ryan where he's like,
wait,

213
00:08:10,071 --> 00:08:10,431
wait,
wait,

214
00:08:10,431 --> 00:08:10,881
no,
no one.

215
00:08:10,881 --> 00:08:13,310
The guys just stick a knife in there.
It is right here.

216
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:16,640
Oh God.
Brutal.

217
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:20,540
Yeah.
It's also looks horrible.

218
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:23,180
Yeah.
Well I think it's,

219
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:24,861
it's,
it's,

220
00:08:24,861 --> 00:08:26,630
it's something you write in a fantasy
novel.

221
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:29,180
Like I don't know how someone could have
hands that strong.

222
00:08:29,181 --> 00:08:30,190
He has hands up.
Yeah,

223
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:31,011
you're right.
What am I saying?

224
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:33,260
Just strongest man in the world.
If anyone has handset strong,

225
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:37,130
he's going through the eyeballs.
You can pop ahead for sure.

226
00:08:37,131 --> 00:08:38,980
Eyeballs first to grip.
Yeah.

227
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,000
Tell you think you could do that to a
baby.

228
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:42,980
Oh,
I thought,

229
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:45,190
I mean you couldn't,
but you could physically,

230
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:46,011
right?
Yes.

231
00:08:46,011 --> 00:08:49,460
You could.
Moral diamond took over my bay or meth.

232
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:51,980
You'll probably wait.
What did I say?

233
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:59,160
I was to a friend of mine and she was
telling me that her dad had been

234
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:03,120
hospitalized and while her dad was
hospitalized,

235
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,620
he was in like this,
uh,

236
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:11,520
like a care home for older people.
And I'm a guy who has schizophrenia,

237
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:15,330
will freaked out and tried to eat him.
Oh God.

238
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:17,040
While he was there.
Well,

239
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:18,000
yeah.
And then he said,

240
00:09:18,001 --> 00:09:19,230
fuck this,
get me out of here.

241
00:09:19,231 --> 00:09:22,320
And he wound up dying at home.
We want of dying at home rather than die

242
00:09:22,321 --> 00:09:24,090
in the hospital because a guy tried to
eat him.

243
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:29,360
Imagine like your last couple days of
life or escaping a schizophrenia guy who

244
00:09:29,491 --> 00:09:32,790
got out of his room and tried to eat it.
This is why I worked so hard all my life

245
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:34,320
and raised a family and now I'm here.
I mean,

246
00:09:34,321 --> 00:09:37,490
that's already your worst fears to be
Sidai away from your loved ones just

247
00:09:37,491 --> 00:09:40,710
around strangers to be back at the first
day of high school basically.

248
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:43,590
But you're old and everyone's old,
but then someone's trying to kill you

249
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:46,170
and eat you.
We don't,

250
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:48,810
we don't get rid of people like that
quick enough.

251
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,291
Like,
you know,

252
00:09:49,291 --> 00:09:51,870
you get rid of bad dogs,
dogs bite people.

253
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:53,920
You put them dot.
Yeah.

254
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,380
Yeah.
I should.

255
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:58,320
I got to tell my mother that because she
works with this group called the

256
00:09:58,321 --> 00:10:01,500
village,
which creates a network in any given

257
00:10:01,501 --> 00:10:03,330
neighborhood where if you're young or
you're old,

258
00:10:03,331 --> 00:10:05,400
you registered on Kourtney thing and
basically,

259
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:08,550
uh,
this person can live out their final

260
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:11,520
years in their home because they have a
network of neighbors who check on them

261
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:14,400
every couple of hours or call me,
here's my cell.

262
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:16,380
Like I have,
I'm having a chest pain.

263
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:16,981
Okay,
cool.

264
00:10:16,981 --> 00:10:18,880
Let's just get you to the hospital.
Cause it's like,

265
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:21,300
I think people deserve to,
you know,

266
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,000
as long as you're not eating people that
killing them,

267
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:25,530
they can die in their homes.

268
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:26,551
Yeah.
That's a,

269
00:10:26,551 --> 00:10:30,090
that's a concern that you really don't
ever want to address until it's too

270
00:10:30,091 --> 00:10:31,180
late.
Yeah.

271
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:31,840
The,
the,

272
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,890
the concern of when and how do I go?
Yeah.

273
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,510
You know,
I mean you have to accept that you're

274
00:10:36,511 --> 00:10:39,630
going to go and some people just have a
really hard time with that.

275
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:42,570
Sure.
And even deep into their old age when

276
00:10:42,571 --> 00:10:44,820
they're just decrepit and they can't
make it any more,

277
00:10:44,821 --> 00:10:47,310
they just can't handle the fact that
it's all going to end.

278
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:48,360
No,
no.

279
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:52,830
That's why you have to live your life to
the fullest and not bite your tongue and

280
00:10:52,831 --> 00:10:57,831
just be yourself because I guess or just
chill the fuck out and wait for the end.

281
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:01,500
What do you do?
One of the two,

282
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:04,080
I don't know.
What is the life to the fullest,

283
00:11:04,081 --> 00:11:06,210
right?
If it's all temporary.

284
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,160
Sure,
absolutely.

285
00:11:08,161 --> 00:11:10,260
I mean there,
there is that point where it's just

286
00:11:10,261 --> 00:11:10,741
like,
well,

287
00:11:10,741 --> 00:11:11,910
is there any point to life?

288
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:13,850
I don't know.
I've gone back and forth with trussell

289
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:16,110
on this where I'm just like,
Duncan,

290
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:19,800
Duncan will fucking send you down a
rabbit hole with that man.

291
00:11:19,801 --> 00:11:20,960
I don't know man.
Yeah,

292
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:24,810
the cosmic,
he'll make some sense out of it.

293
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,930
He will.
He is the cosmic trickster without a

294
00:11:27,931 --> 00:11:29,760
doubt.
I were bordain speaking of Dane,

295
00:11:29,761 --> 00:11:31,380
he was that he was saying,
they were like,

296
00:11:31,381 --> 00:11:32,670
how would you like to go?
And he was just like,

297
00:11:32,671 --> 00:11:35,790
I just want just one bullet in the back
of my skull and you'll see a comment.

298
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,670
Yeah.
But meanwhile he did it himself and did

299
00:11:37,671 --> 00:11:39,740
it with a rope.
Yeah.

300
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,290
It's just,
I was friends with them.

301
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,990
I that would fuck me up.
Fuck me up.

302
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:46,140
I wasn't,
and I was a fan of his since the first

303
00:11:46,141 --> 00:11:48,120
article came out in the New Yorker that
he wrote,

304
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:51,300
it fucks you up because you just go,
I wish she called me.

305
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:52,231
Yeah.
I wish.

306
00:11:52,231 --> 00:11:54,010
Or I mean I would have to France,

307
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:55,803
no,
I wouldn't of,

308
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:56,861
oh,
does it suck it up.

309
00:11:56,861 --> 00:11:57,694
Pussy.
Right.

310
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:59,300
Don't kill yourself in France.
Yeah.

311
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:01,450
But in back to America,
she would have checked in.

312
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:02,130
Yeah.
Cause I mean,

313
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:05,830
I know it's all about perspective.
There are times where we've all come

314
00:12:05,831 --> 00:12:07,780
close to not necessarily putting a gun
in.

315
00:12:07,781 --> 00:12:10,030
Our mouths were rope around her neck,
but where you just feel like there's no

316
00:12:10,031 --> 00:12:11,100
point.
Yeah,

317
00:12:11,101 --> 00:12:12,460
no,
but someone can just come in.

318
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:16,600
I say it like coming up in the,
in the crew that I came up with in

319
00:12:16,601 --> 00:12:18,070
Chicago,
you know,

320
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:20,510
Canadian and Hannibal.
Uh,

321
00:12:20,511 --> 00:12:21,490
and,
and people like,

322
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:23,650
we,
we never let each other get away with

323
00:12:23,651 --> 00:12:25,000
shit where it's just like,
yeah,

324
00:12:25,001 --> 00:12:26,710
you're saying that,
but fuck you.

325
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:28,780
Like you need those people in your life.
I'll never forget.

326
00:12:28,781 --> 00:12:30,460
I went through a horrible breakup and I
went,

327
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:34,180
I was in my apartment for like a week,
only leaving to wait tables and

328
00:12:34,181 --> 00:12:34,900
bartender.

329
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:37,570
And then I finally came to a show and
Kinane is like,

330
00:12:37,571 --> 00:12:39,420
hey,
look who pushed aside all the clumps of

331
00:12:39,421 --> 00:12:42,160
used Kleenex to be with us.
Welcome back you fucking pussy.

332
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:45,130
And I remember laughing so hard and it
all went away.

333
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:48,430
It all went away.
It just cause you take yourself so

334
00:12:48,431 --> 00:12:50,210
seriously and it was never going to get
better.

335
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:51,340
And it's,
I mean,

336
00:12:51,341 --> 00:12:55,390
I just think about despair as this demon
that latches onto your back and it's

337
00:12:55,391 --> 00:12:58,060
your job to fuck it up,
get it off you.

338
00:12:58,090 --> 00:12:59,740
You know what,
what's your thing?

339
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:02,500
Uh,
destroyed the fight.

340
00:13:02,501 --> 00:13:06,760
The bitch in you conquer your inner
bitlocker year you're going to pitch is,

341
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:08,980
I usually,
when I'm referring your inner pitch,

342
00:13:08,981 --> 00:13:11,360
I mean the inner bitch,
it doesn't want you to work out well.

343
00:13:11,361 --> 00:13:12,160
That's,
that's,

344
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,600
that's the one I relate to the most
where it's at.

345
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:18,070
I feel that every time I'm in a class,
every time I'm in something like that,

346
00:13:18,071 --> 00:13:19,600
it's just like something and you're just
like,

347
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:22,200
I just want to sandbag it.
Let me just sand.

348
00:13:22,201 --> 00:13:23,860
But just this time,
well,

349
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:25,270
I mean everybody has that.
Yeah,

350
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:28,120
I still have it,
but I've got that motherfucker on

351
00:13:28,121 --> 00:13:29,550
lockdown.
Good.

352
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:31,630
Now I own him.
Good.

353
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:33,640
He's in there though.
He's weak.

354
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,850
He never goes away.
Oh,

355
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:36,310
he's always trying to tell you you
don't,

356
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:38,440
you can take the day off.
Maybe your ankle sore,

357
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:40,390
maybe.
Maybe you're feeling a little sick,

358
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,450
a little run down.
You should,

359
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,430
you know,
take a take a you day.

360
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:45,280
The dog looks tired.
He doesn't even want to run.

361
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:46,180
You know,
it's not about you.

362
00:13:46,181 --> 00:13:48,520
You should take care of that dog.
Dog does not want to run.

363
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:52,000
My Dad said something brilliant on the,
for my dad lately,

364
00:13:52,001 --> 00:13:53,710
like he's always been like a guy in no
words.

365
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:56,650
You mentioned like hospice,
living and stuff.

366
00:13:56,651 --> 00:13:59,290
My Dad used to do hospice and he,
he would just,

367
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:00,550
he was like,
do I have to talk?

368
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:01,630
And the guy's like,
no,

369
00:14:01,631 --> 00:14:03,200
you can.
They just mostly want to someone to

370
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:03,731
listen.
He's like,

371
00:14:03,731 --> 00:14:05,950
I can do that.
And two would sit by dying people and

372
00:14:05,951 --> 00:14:08,070
just nod his head and stuff.
And uh,

373
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:09,730
but he never,
he never talk about it.

374
00:14:09,731 --> 00:14:10,630
Where I'd be like,
Dad,

375
00:14:10,631 --> 00:14:11,500
what are you doing today?
He's like,

376
00:14:11,501 --> 00:14:13,240
I'm going to go hang out with bill.
Like Dad,

377
00:14:13,241 --> 00:14:14,680
who the fuck is bill?
I was this guy,

378
00:14:14,681 --> 00:14:15,830
he's dying.
Like,

379
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:17,140
Dad,
you got to tell me more than this.

380
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,810
So now we're kind of,
he's opening up more,

381
00:14:19,811 --> 00:14:22,000
but long story long,
he was like,

382
00:14:22,001 --> 00:14:23,650
you know,
when you're waking up in the middle of

383
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:25,720
the night and there's that voice in your
head that is telling you you,

384
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:26,531
you're,
you're,

385
00:14:26,531 --> 00:14:27,780
you're useless and you're,
you know,

386
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:29,830
you haven't done enough with your life
and things like that.

387
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:31,690
He's like,
I don't know if there is a devil,

388
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:33,160
but if there is,
that's him.

389
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:34,300
And I was like,
fuck.

390
00:14:34,301 --> 00:14:35,980
And it just blew my mind.
Right.

391
00:14:35,981 --> 00:14:36,880
And it's like,
dad,

392
00:14:36,881 --> 00:14:39,190
you're right.
That voice that tells you to give up

393
00:14:39,191 --> 00:14:41,930
that voice that tells you like not to,
not and not to,

394
00:14:41,931 --> 00:14:43,840
you know,
to hate yourself and you know,

395
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:46,960
don't think you're worthy.
Well then it's such a weird pattern.

396
00:14:46,961 --> 00:14:48,550
Right.
Because it doesn't have any real

397
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:52,250
evolutionary benefit.
What is the benefit

398
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:57,080
of self loathing and,
and just sitting around feeling pity.

399
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:58,100
Yeah.
Yeah.

400
00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:00,170
They're,
they're plenty people in situations that

401
00:15:00,171 --> 00:15:02,060
are going to kick the shit out of you in
life anyway.

402
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,530
Why?
Why do it to yourself,

403
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:06,470
but yeah,
but there's something good about feeling

404
00:15:06,471 --> 00:15:10,580
very disappointed in yourself because
then it makes you work harder and like

405
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:15,320
you recognize or at least try to realize
your potential better.

406
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,990
You get more done and you feel better
about yourself.

407
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:19,430
Yeah,
absolutely.

408
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,520
Yeah.
There's definitely something there is,

409
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:22,550
you know,
especially if you're,

410
00:15:22,551 --> 00:15:25,040
you're in competitive sports or
something like that where you just,

411
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:28,730
there's nothing you hate more than
losing get because otherwise you won't

412
00:15:28,731 --> 00:15:29,541
work as hard.
Yeah.

413
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:32,600
But Jamie was talking about coby Brian,
but what a psycho he was when he was

414
00:15:32,601 --> 00:15:35,180
planning.
And they always say that about Michael

415
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:36,860
Jordan.
And of course Mike Tyson was like that.

416
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:40,970
Coby said he learned it from Michael.
That's like what he passed on to stay on

417
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:42,410
coby.
Pass it on to Lebron.

418
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,250
Yeah,
they went on the Olympic team again.

419
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:49,320
I heard Lebron spends one point $5
million a year on recovery because

420
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:53,900
recovery just recovery.
Cryo therapy massage.

421
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:56,950
A million and a half every year.
Yeah.

422
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:59,390
Yeah.
What a fucking stud.

423
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:04,310
She's crying that guy so bad ass.
He's like maximizing,

424
00:16:04,311 --> 00:16:08,810
everything was like a perfect example of
someone was Maxima Freak.

425
00:16:08,811 --> 00:16:10,490
Genetics.
Powerful.

426
00:16:10,491 --> 00:16:12,980
We'll intelligence.
But then on top of that,

427
00:16:12,981 --> 00:16:17,540
maximizing everything,
built a school has a good sense of humor

428
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:19,280
about himself.
Decent actor.

429
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:22,410
You know,
he was so funny and um,

430
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,560
uh,
was it?

431
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:25,670
No,
it wasn't wrecked.

432
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:28,240
The Amy Schumer movie train wreck.
It was,

433
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:29,210
I was asked half.
Right.

434
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:32,630
Yeah.
Did you ever see that hbo show where

435
00:16:32,631 --> 00:16:34,360
they're sitting around with them?
You may shop.

436
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:35,413
Yes.
Yeah.

437
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,370
He's fucking great in that.

438
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,140
And you get that insight.
It's like,

439
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:40,580
oh,
that's why you're so good.

440
00:16:40,581 --> 00:16:42,950
You're hock and crazy.
Like he was talking about his son

441
00:16:42,951 --> 00:16:46,520
playing and he's talking about his mom
and like he's just his,

442
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:49,010
his drive and you know,
he doesn't,

443
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:51,440
he doesn't let anything go.
It's fascinating to me.

444
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:54,780
People like that that are like extreme
winters are there.

445
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,250
There's such a rare person,
you know,

446
00:16:57,370 --> 00:16:59,360
and it's,
and it's rare that you could probably

447
00:16:59,361 --> 00:17:00,990
stand to be around them.
Yeah.

448
00:17:00,991 --> 00:17:02,750
That's the thing.
Especially like your,

449
00:17:02,751 --> 00:17:05,360
your kind of your,
your tech billionaires or something like

450
00:17:05,361 --> 00:17:06,194
that.
It's like,

451
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,430
after a while you'd be like,
you know,

452
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:10,510
I'm going to go to the comedy store and,
and uh,

453
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:14,060
we're going to break each other's balls
for a while because this is weird man.

454
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,890
Right.
Like Steve Jobs,

455
00:17:16,090 --> 00:17:19,390
like known by everyone as an extreme
cont yeah,

456
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:20,090
right.

457
00:17:20,090 --> 00:17:22,190
He was just a con.
There's no way around it.

458
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:23,120
Yeah.
Brutal.

459
00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:24,950
Do you remember that video?
There's a video.

460
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:28,430
It's a,
he's demonstrating an apple product and

461
00:17:28,431 --> 00:17:30,770
he can't give this camera to work and
he's pressing all these buttons.

462
00:17:30,771 --> 00:17:33,650
It doesn't work.
And he throws it at the engineer with

463
00:17:33,651 --> 00:17:36,480
this like purse lips.
Uh Huh.

464
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:37,700
He's like,
here you fix it.

465
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:41,910
See if you can get it work.
He just wants you fucking Loeser.

466
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,510
I'm in front of a million pay pal and he
can't,

467
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:48,710
he can't lose his mind cause it's like
that Japanese ethic of the person who

468
00:17:48,711 --> 00:17:51,430
loses temper first loses right.
No matter who's right or wrong.

469
00:17:51,431 --> 00:17:53,760
I'm sure he loses his tempo privately.
Oh,

470
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:55,210
without a doubt.
It is.

471
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:56,223
Watch this.
Right?

472
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:57,510
It's like he can't get it to work.

473
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:03,480
My camera's not turn it on.
What's that?

474
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:09,140
I could slide it and let go.
Angry.

475
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:10,330
Not Turning on

476
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:16,540
please like this.
Yeah,

477
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:18,920
you fucking,
he's fucking Turkey.

478
00:18:18,921 --> 00:18:21,010
He's this close to Rome.
The Roman emperor.

479
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,270
Throw him into boiling pit.
You gotta think Jeff Bezos is like that

480
00:18:27,271 --> 00:18:28,104
too.
Right?

481
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:34,710
To be and just to be the richest man in
all of the world's not real.

482
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,510
He's not really the richest man in all
the world.

483
00:18:36,511 --> 00:18:39,270
He's the richest man who has a publicly
declared income.

484
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:41,340
Ah,
there's a big difference between him and

485
00:18:41,341 --> 00:18:42,690
really good guards.
Yeah.

486
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:43,860
Yeah.
The oligarchs,

487
00:18:43,861 --> 00:18:45,840
probably a drug cartel.
100%.

488
00:18:45,841 --> 00:18:46,830
Well,
not trashed hotels.

489
00:18:46,831 --> 00:18:47,940
I don't think they have that kind of
money.

490
00:18:47,941 --> 00:18:49,680
But I think for sure,
um,

491
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:53,790
Saudi Arabian princes and Middle Eastern
and income,

492
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:55,470
right.
They have trillions.

493
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,340
Yeah,
yeah,

494
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:58,003
yeah.
Right.

495
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:00,270
Yeah.
That's different.

496
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:02,610
People don't talk about that and those
guys don't talk about it either.

497
00:19:02,611 --> 00:19:05,760
They just go,
they let Bill Gates take the rap.

498
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:06,721
Sure.
Meanwhile,

499
00:19:06,721 --> 00:19:08,760
they own like whole countries.

500
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:10,530
It's almost like how,
uh,

501
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:13,530
people,
people that have people that I went to

502
00:19:13,531 --> 00:19:15,390
college with are ways around that their
family,

503
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:17,400
they came from money,
they never showed it.

504
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:17,881
Oh,
of course.

505
00:19:17,881 --> 00:19:20,150
They always wore bummy clothes,
you know,

506
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,250
but like someone who was acting like
they had money to have like a dunhill

507
00:19:23,251 --> 00:19:26,580
lighter or something,
I'll roll acts or something fancy.

508
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:27,720
But like,
that's,

509
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:29,790
that's,
that's those countries basically like

510
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:33,120
the kid with the scuffed up a gym shoes
that you're like,

511
00:19:33,121 --> 00:19:34,980
man,
I know Michael Milkens your dad,

512
00:19:34,981 --> 00:19:36,540
dude,
I know he's your dad.

513
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:38,220
Right?
I was gonna play with this kid.

514
00:19:38,221 --> 00:19:38,701
And I was like,
oh,

515
00:19:38,701 --> 00:19:39,420
really?
Yeah.

516
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:41,550
I think he,
he was Kinda like,

517
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,920
it's gotta be unnerving for him.
He's a good guy.

518
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:45,720
I don't know how much contact you have
with his dad,

519
00:19:45,721 --> 00:19:46,980
but it was just like,
uh,

520
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,140
your dad's the junk bond king right now.

521
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:50,400
He's your dad.
That junk bond,

522
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:52,650
your dad,
the whole reason why you're getting by

523
00:19:52,651 --> 00:19:57,630
so smoothly and the walls are so greased
for you in this life as your dad was a

524
00:19:57,631 --> 00:19:59,400
human scumbag.
Yeah.

525
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:01,260
Full,
full on with wealth.

526
00:20:01,261 --> 00:20:04,620
There's always a displacement.
Someone's rich because other people are

527
00:20:04,621 --> 00:20:07,020
poor on some level.
But that was the most direct

528
00:20:07,021 --> 00:20:09,100
correlation.
Always the case like this.

529
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,560
How about this?
Like beyonce,

530
00:20:10,561 --> 00:20:13,260
is beyonce rich because someone's poor
or is it beyonce?

531
00:20:13,261 --> 00:20:15,370
Rich cause she talented and she worked
hard.

532
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:15,841
No,
listen,

533
00:20:15,841 --> 00:20:17,250
don't get me wrong.
I don't think it's,

534
00:20:17,251 --> 00:20:19,020
it's,
it's across the board like that,

535
00:20:19,021 --> 00:20:21,090
but I just think in turn a lot of ways.
A lot of ways.

536
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:21,840
Yeah.
Not ever.

537
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:22,980
No Way.
Not every time.

538
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:24,360
Right.
But people love to say that.

539
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:25,231
Yeah,
of course.

540
00:20:25,231 --> 00:20:25,891
You know,
like he,

541
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:26,611
sure,
okay.

542
00:20:26,611 --> 00:20:30,090
The Jennifer Lawrence fuck a bunch of
people over or she just really good at

543
00:20:30,091 --> 00:20:31,290
actually,
she's amazing.

544
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:34,860
Are you sure?
No disparity of wealth is because

545
00:20:34,861 --> 00:20:37,140
someone's out there being evil or is she
just really good?

546
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:39,660
Right.
And the thing that gets me is that they

547
00:20:39,661 --> 00:20:41,390
always dump on those people.
Uh,

548
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,440
the public figure.
So people explore,

549
00:20:43,441 --> 00:20:47,010
especially biggest example or like,
like sports figures were like,

550
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:47,691
I mean,
sure,

551
00:20:47,691 --> 00:20:49,210
you get that much for a fight.
It's like,

552
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:50,753
uh,
are,

553
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:53,310
do people want to watch you fight?
You get that much,

554
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:57,880
you should get fight.
[inaudible] knocked off for $1 million.

555
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:00,130
That's my favorite.
He didn't say that.

556
00:21:00,131 --> 00:21:02,200
Oh,
I'd fuck you get punched by Mike Tyson

557
00:21:02,201 --> 00:21:03,500
for $1 million.
Yeah.

558
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:06,010
First of all,
you'd have to get in by enough people

559
00:21:06,011 --> 00:21:07,820
that want to pay to see you get,
not just,

560
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:10,090
you have to make it worth a million to
see you lose your life.

561
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:12,790
Quite frankly.
Richard Lewis had that joke about his

562
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:14,360
uncle.
I remember when I was a kid and I'm

563
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:16,000
watching the TV and like laughing till I
cry,

564
00:21:16,001 --> 00:21:17,620
where he said,
oh yeah,

565
00:21:17,621 --> 00:21:18,550
I think it was Tyson actually.

566
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:19,210
It was like,
Yo,

567
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:20,380
I'd fight him for a million.
He's like,

568
00:21:20,381 --> 00:21:22,300
yeah,
like anyone would paid 300 bucks a seat

569
00:21:22,301 --> 00:21:25,030
at Madison Square Garden to see an old
Jewish guy get punched once in the face

570
00:21:25,031 --> 00:21:28,930
and cry.
I laugh because it was so specific,

571
00:21:28,931 --> 00:21:31,810
like be crying.
He'd be drooling.

572
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:35,530
You wouldn't be able to lose half your
intelligence see straight anymore.

573
00:21:35,531 --> 00:21:39,460
You're fucking skull would be broken.
They'd have to bolt it back together

574
00:21:39,461 --> 00:21:40,900
again.
You'd have to have everyone.

575
00:21:40,901 --> 00:21:44,170
I love hostage in like a warehouse to
let him punch me once.

576
00:21:44,171 --> 00:21:46,540
Dude,
when he was here the other day and I was

577
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,160
just,
I met him before.

578
00:21:48,161 --> 00:21:49,540
I met him once before,
took picture with them,

579
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:52,330
but every time you meet him you're like,
yeah,

580
00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:52,991
okay,
okay.

581
00:21:52,991 --> 00:21:55,960
This is really Mike Tyson.
He's really here and I'm shaking hands

582
00:21:55,961 --> 00:21:56,800
with him.
He gives me a hug.

583
00:21:56,950 --> 00:21:58,510
He's hugged like hugging a tree.

584
00:21:58,900 --> 00:21:59,651
He's like,
wow,

585
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:01,600
oak tree.
It's just like funk.

586
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:03,940
Aha.
He's just this beast of a man.

587
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:06,070
Well,
I remember watching those first fights.

588
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:09,880
It was like watching you put a dog in a
ring with a wolf every time.

589
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:12,280
It was just like that.
He would just run right through

590
00:22:12,281 --> 00:22:13,990
everybody to the point where you're
like,

591
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:15,490
oh,
he's not from here.

592
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:16,930
You know,
kind of like those,

593
00:22:16,931 --> 00:22:17,500
those,
those,

594
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:20,530
those comic books were aliens.
It's like they're on a planet that has

595
00:22:20,531 --> 00:22:23,470
way more gravity or something.
Say just punched fish right through your

596
00:22:23,471 --> 00:22:24,580
chest.
Yeah.

597
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:25,840
Yeah.
That was a superman,

598
00:22:26,050 --> 00:22:28,300
superman.
But if that happened,

599
00:22:28,301 --> 00:22:31,180
what's fucked up about that?
Like scientists must get crazy about

600
00:22:31,181 --> 00:22:33,970
that because if that happened you'd be
like really sick.

601
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:37,240
Like the,
like when people go to space and they're

602
00:22:37,241 --> 00:22:39,940
in space for six months,
like their body breaks down.

603
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:40,110
Yeah.

604
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:43,360
You lose like years from your life
really fucked up.

605
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:46,830
It's not good.
Commander Chris Hadfield on the podcast

606
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:47,673
Belk.
Cool.

607
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:50,500
And he said that when he came back he
literally couldn't stand,

608
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,580
his equilibrium was so fucked up cause
he had been in space for six months.

609
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,700
Then when he came back,
like it was a horribly throwing up.

610
00:22:58,090 --> 00:22:59,140
He like,
he like,

611
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:02,170
he couldn't see straight.
Like when you'd stand,

612
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:05,890
the world was all wobbly and shit.
Like his equilibrium was completely

613
00:23:05,891 --> 00:23:07,210
gone.
I mean,

614
00:23:07,211 --> 00:23:08,410
I think,
you know,

615
00:23:08,411 --> 00:23:11,410
superhero movies are kind of
fundamentally ridiculous and silly.

616
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,240
I love comics.
I grew up on them and stuff,

617
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:16,210
but they never,
they never take physics into account.

618
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:18,370
And really it's always like you hit with
a gamma ray,

619
00:23:18,371 --> 00:23:19,900
you get powers.
It's like,

620
00:23:19,901 --> 00:23:22,900
why would it choose to give you powers?
It would just melt you.

621
00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:24,910
Like,
that's not how forces in the universe

622
00:23:24,911 --> 00:23:25,300
work.

623
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:26,560
They don't,
you know,

624
00:23:27,050 --> 00:23:29,290
generally speaking mystically,
you know,

625
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:31,270
no,
never gets enhanced in real life by like

626
00:23:31,271 --> 00:23:32,560
nuclear radiation.
No,

627
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:35,200
I don't think that's ever,
ever happened.

628
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:37,210
I the boat,
the best theory would probably be like

629
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:40,060
Godzilla.
Like some monster was born of it that

630
00:23:40,061 --> 00:23:44,020
came out of the ocean.
There was a time where vice went to

631
00:23:44,021 --> 00:23:48,050
Chernobyl and uh,
this was back when vice was really vice,

632
00:23:48,051 --> 00:23:50,540
when Shane Smith was going on all these
journey and shit.

633
00:23:50,541 --> 00:23:51,530
That was what was nuts.
Yeah.

634
00:23:51,531 --> 00:23:53,480
Before vices,
sort of vice,

635
00:23:53,481 --> 00:23:55,100
I mean,
vice still does some great stuff,

636
00:23:55,101 --> 00:24:00,101
but vices just as huge multimedia
corporation now and back then,

637
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:03,350
uh,
Shane went to Chernobyl and,

638
00:24:03,351 --> 00:24:06,500
uh,
they were hunting like these radioactive

639
00:24:06,501 --> 00:24:07,420
wolves.
Well,

640
00:24:07,421 --> 00:24:10,430
Mike is radioactive wolves and Chernobyl
and like,

641
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:11,810
you know,
they're mutating.

642
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:16,220
There's fish in the water that are
enormous and they're fucking weird and

643
00:24:16,221 --> 00:24:17,030
you can never eat them.

644
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:19,940
They're like the fifth fishing near the
plant in a simpsons like with three

645
00:24:19,941 --> 00:24:20,601
eyes.
Right,

646
00:24:20,601 --> 00:24:21,650
exactly.
Yeah.

647
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:22,970
But the,
but it's real.

648
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,780
Like they really do have these animals
that live in this highly radiated area

649
00:24:26,781 --> 00:24:31,781
and they've managed to survive by just
guy mean that the level,

650
00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:36,900
the levels that we,
that we have taken to get energy and

651
00:24:36,901 --> 00:24:38,570
affected our environment.
We,

652
00:24:38,571 --> 00:24:42,170
you ever dropped San Diego?
You know that ride when you drive down

653
00:24:42,171 --> 00:24:43,790
and you look to the right hand side.
Oh look.

654
00:24:43,791 --> 00:24:46,700
Nuclear power plant.
I could throw a rock and hit it from the

655
00:24:46,701 --> 00:24:48,950
highway.
Like what in the fuck is that doing

656
00:24:48,951 --> 00:24:49,760
there?
Yeah.

657
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:53,540
So close to the water.
Well I think it needs to be close to the

658
00:24:53,541 --> 00:24:55,100
water for cooling.
Oh yeah.

659
00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:57,140
That's how they cool the reactor core.
Okay.

660
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:59,390
I think,
notice I say that like I know what I'm

661
00:24:59,391 --> 00:24:59,750
talking about.

662
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:00,291
That makes sense.
Yeah.

663
00:25:00,291 --> 00:25:02,240
There's a,
there's a nuclear physicist right now.

664
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,180
Nope.
Well,

665
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:06,890
that was the Fukushima thing.
That's what's happening over there.

666
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,990
They still don't have that thing under
wraps.

667
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:13,760
Well and debt that volunteer army of of
Japanese people older than 70 that were

668
00:25:13,761 --> 00:25:14,930
like,
I don't have long.

669
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:16,820
I'll go work there.
I'll go clean it up.

670
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,220
They're all going back in time.
They're all 39 you go there.

671
00:25:19,221 --> 00:25:21,320
It's like a Stephen King movie.
Amazing.

672
00:25:21,321 --> 00:25:23,330
I do twice a 30 years old.
They don't want to tell anybody.

673
00:25:23,370 --> 00:25:24,141
Oh,
commission.

674
00:25:24,141 --> 00:25:26,820
I didn't know that the way to San Diego.
Yeah,

675
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:29,270
probably broke everybody around.
It's dead.

676
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:30,770
Yeah.
Cause everyone was throwing rocks.

677
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:31,960
It's like Joe Washes.
Yeah.

678
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,850
Yeah,
but maybe they woke up and like 1980 and

679
00:25:34,851 --> 00:25:35,630
they go,
hey guys,

680
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:38,690
maybe this isn't a good place for a
fucking nuclear power plants.

681
00:25:38,691 --> 00:25:43,670
Steam generators failed in 2013 Jesus
steam generators.

682
00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:45,080
There it goes.
There it is.

683
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:47,570
The fuck out of here with that.
It's over.

684
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,940
Meanwhile that's still there.
Like the core is still there.

685
00:25:49,941 --> 00:25:52,820
They can't move it.
It's currently in preparation to be

686
00:25:52,821 --> 00:25:54,120
decommissioned.
Jeez.

687
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:58,130
However long that takes g's ever that
even that means man,

688
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:00,200
go fishing around that fucking thing.
Good luck.

689
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:03,470
You'll catch a big fish though.
I know.

690
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:05,040
Weird.
They'll have human hands,

691
00:26:05,041 --> 00:26:07,550
he'll talk to you.
Don't eat what?

692
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:10,850
But they talk with thoughts.
Right?

693
00:26:10,851 --> 00:26:15,350
They just stare at you and to your mind
Fukishima they were doing something

694
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:20,310
where they dug this giant swimming pool
and all around this giant swimming pool

695
00:26:20,311 --> 00:26:23,450
that they dug.
They put like ice cores,

696
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:28,610
they put like some sort of cooling
element so they could freeze all the

697
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:32,930
nuclear waste to it and insanely cold
temperature didn't work.

698
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,870
This is like a strategy that they were
developing,

699
00:26:35,871 --> 00:26:37,040
but apparently it fell apart.

700
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,820
I don't know what the fuck to do.
It's just you just don't,

701
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:43,860
you can't do anything.
I mean like they gotta do something.

702
00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:45,960
You got to keep trying to shoot it in a
space.

703
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:49,020
I Dunno.
Then the aliens are going to get mad at

704
00:26:49,021 --> 00:26:49,740
us.
Yeah.

705
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:50,730
Well there already.
Do you know,

706
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:53,370
like I,
I had a friend who I used to live with

707
00:26:53,371 --> 00:26:56,880
who was kind of new agey but also
conspiracy theory ish and he would,

708
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,880
he was convinced that our planet was the
Mo,

709
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:03,870
the off limits zone for the entire
universe where every other plan it was

710
00:27:03,871 --> 00:27:05,250
much more advanced and they were just
like,

711
00:27:05,251 --> 00:27:09,180
don't go down there.
All they do is fight and blow things up

712
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:11,190
and they're,
and they don't share with each other and

713
00:27:11,191 --> 00:27:12,120
stuff.
It's just don't,

714
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:14,610
that's why no aliens come.
So all that,

715
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,650
when people do stuff like that,
I always feel like they're

716
00:27:16,651 --> 00:27:20,310
anthropomorphizing like the idea that
their life would be anything like our

717
00:27:20,311 --> 00:27:23,270
life is a bunch of characteristic.

718
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,280
Agree with you more?
Yeah.

719
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:27,150
I mean there's a bunch of care.
This is a bunch of things that have to

720
00:27:27,151 --> 00:27:31,320
be in place for us to get to the point
where we're going to war with each other

721
00:27:31,321 --> 00:27:32,890
that are people that are over there and
right.

722
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:35,280
There is no war in the ocean.
Ever noticed that?

723
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:35,910
No,
exactly.

724
00:27:35,910 --> 00:27:36,990
Yeah,
it was an ocean wars.

725
00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:38,540
They don't,
they don't have and there,

726
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,260
you know,
they just eat each other.

727
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:41,430
Yeah.
And there's normal,

728
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:43,770
there's parts of the ocean we can't
reach and there's,

729
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:45,210
who knows if there's a,
there's a,

730
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:47,580
there's a whole other civilization down
there,

731
00:27:47,670 --> 00:27:50,430
you know.
That's why we like really bond with

732
00:27:50,431 --> 00:27:54,990
mammals only because fish don't do a
goddamn thing for their kids yet.

733
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:59,490
Those dirty fuck cause they don't really
have them like it's a trick.

734
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,280
It's like nature's trick them into not
being attached by the kids.

735
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:06,420
They blast some eggs down on the bottom
of the floor and then the males come

736
00:28:06,421 --> 00:28:08,610
along and just on the egg.
Sure I'm done here.

737
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:10,710
I'll get out of there and they jet,
that's it.

738
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:12,970
And I leave like millions of kids.
Yeah.

739
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:16,380
The only ones that take care of them.
And there's a few female fish that keep

740
00:28:16,381 --> 00:28:18,330
the babies in their mouth.
You ever seen those?

741
00:28:18,331 --> 00:28:20,090
Yeah.
And then they let him go like,

742
00:28:20,091 --> 00:28:22,160
and when the babies are in trouble,
they hold them in their mouth and then

743
00:28:22,170 --> 00:28:25,020
like everybody gone good and they opened
up and the babies get to swim around.

744
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:26,483
Yeah.
That's it.

745
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:28,520
Once test fit in mom's mouth,
you're fucking,

746
00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:31,660
which there's a bumper sticker for you.
It's,

747
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:34,890
but things that live in the ocean that
we do love,

748
00:28:34,891 --> 00:28:36,840
like dolphins,
take care of their young.

749
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:39,440
Yup.
Killer whales take care of the young.

750
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,113
Yeah.
Right.

751
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:42,930
It's really weird.
You don't take care of your young,

752
00:28:42,931 --> 00:28:45,420
you can fuck yourself.
It's kind of a mammalian trait.

753
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:46,410
Yeah,
yeah,

754
00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:47,310
yeah,
yeah,

755
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:48,670
but like you're saying,
you can't,

756
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:53,740
we always try to create a like on other
planets is how does this,

757
00:28:53,741 --> 00:28:55,540
it does this smell like,
yeah.

758
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,510
Love that.
You've found that right away.

759
00:28:57,810 --> 00:28:59,460
That is amazing.
One is on the outside.

760
00:28:59,670 --> 00:29:00,540
Mom.
Jesus.

761
00:29:00,541 --> 00:29:01,560
Yeah.
Last door.

762
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:03,570
Yeah.
That's crazy.

763
00:29:03,571 --> 00:29:05,880
What kind of fish is that?
Doesn't say.

764
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:07,020
Wow.
That's amazing.

765
00:29:07,021 --> 00:29:08,940
It's like it's smoking fish,
right?

766
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:10,140
Yeah.
Like it's a hookah.

767
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,220
I get soup.
Dawson blowing out Swedish too.

768
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:15,810
It looks like a group or something.
It looks like something in the Bass

769
00:29:15,811 --> 00:29:16,620
family.
Yeah,

770
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:19,140
it's gorgeous fish.
You mentioned the thing with feet and

771
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:23,100
I'd watch the Blue Planet to the other
day and there is not a fish apparently

772
00:29:23,101 --> 00:29:26,880
it's called like a toad of some kind,
but it hangs out on the bottom and it

773
00:29:26,881 --> 00:29:27,581
has feet.
It's,

774
00:29:27,581 --> 00:29:30,540
it looks like a fish that grew feet.
It walks around.

775
00:29:30,541 --> 00:29:32,040
Yeah.
That's not a fish.

776
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:34,710
I don't believe so.
It's actually a some sort of toad I

777
00:29:34,711 --> 00:29:36,230
think technically.
Whoa.

778
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:39,320
But yeah,
and they look like human feet almost

779
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:41,440
like how his toes and everything.
It's amazing.

780
00:29:41,441 --> 00:29:42,190
One of the weirdest

781
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:44,980
things that I ever saw about the ocean
was there was a theory that was going

782
00:29:44,981 --> 00:29:49,420
around a few years ago that I,
I don't know if this is legit or not,

783
00:29:49,421 --> 00:29:51,670
go google,
that they think that it's entirely

784
00:29:51,671 --> 00:29:56,671
possible that octopus Octopi may have
come from eggs that were frozen and

785
00:29:58,571 --> 00:30:01,720
landed here from an asteroid.
There was speculation that there was

786
00:30:01,721 --> 00:30:03,430
something about the way,
yeah.

787
00:30:03,431 --> 00:30:05,260
The way that they pro,
you know,

788
00:30:05,261 --> 00:30:10,261
the DNA and rna of,
of octopus are so different than every

789
00:30:10,601 --> 00:30:14,810
other animal in the fossil record that
it's almost that there,

790
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:17,440
there was a consideration that they
might have actually been an alien

791
00:30:17,441 --> 00:30:21,070
species because you know the term,
you know what Panspermia means.

792
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:26,230
Panspermia is a theory that is pretty
widely accepted in the scientific

793
00:30:26,231 --> 00:30:31,120
community that some life is transferred
through asteroidal collisions.

794
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,360
So like that,
say if a,

795
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:38,170
a chunk of rock slams into our planet
and knocks a chunk of rock loose in that

796
00:30:38,171 --> 00:30:43,171
chunk has dna on it and uh,
the amino acids and all the building

797
00:30:43,421 --> 00:30:45,790
blocks for life,
that bacteria,

798
00:30:45,791 --> 00:30:46,680
whatever it is,
things that,

799
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,800
some things,
you know,

800
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:51,560
little things can survive in space like
tardigrades little life forms can to

801
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:55,540
survive in space that they slam into a
planet eventually.

802
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:59,230
And then when they do that,
that life is transferred onto that new

803
00:30:59,231 --> 00:31:01,000
planet science news.
Holy Shit.

804
00:31:01,001 --> 00:31:04,930
The buses came to earth from space as
frozen eggs millions of years ago.

805
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,870
Okay.
But this is like the,

806
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:08,410
the express,
I was trying,

807
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:09,750
I read it a little bit.
Yeah.

808
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,730
But that's,
that's the most feasible version of

809
00:31:12,731 --> 00:31:14,130
aliens coming here.
Yes.

810
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:17,260
We tend to think of it as it lands and
they're like a space man who looks like

811
00:31:17,261 --> 00:31:19,840
George Clooney steps out,
but he has like [inaudible] or

812
00:31:19,841 --> 00:31:20,561
something.
It's like,

813
00:31:20,561 --> 00:31:21,031
hi,
I'm,

814
00:31:21,031 --> 00:31:23,480
I'm here to share with our,
our planet all,

815
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:26,530
all tuna or whatever and he speaks
English and all this shit.

816
00:31:26,531 --> 00:31:27,670
Like it's,
it's on a,

817
00:31:27,730 --> 00:31:31,080
on a biological level that we almost
can't comprehend.

818
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:34,150
You could go back to that James please.
I'm really good.

819
00:31:34,151 --> 00:31:37,360
It says that the extraordinary claims
made in a report entitled the case of

820
00:31:37,361 --> 00:31:39,940
Cambrian Explosion,
terrestrial or cosmic,

821
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:43,720
which costed by a group of 33 scientists
and published in the Pr,

822
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:46,270
uh,
progress in biophysics and molecular

823
00:31:46,271 --> 00:31:47,290
biology journal.

824
00:31:47,290 --> 00:31:50,320
And the paper suggest that the
explanation for the sudden flourishing

825
00:31:50,321 --> 00:31:53,410
of life during the Cambrian era,
often referred to as the Cambrian

826
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:58,411
explosion lies in the stars as a result
of earth being bombarded by clouds of

827
00:31:59,171 --> 00:32:00,880
organic molecules.
Wow.

828
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:04,090
I think that's also the theory of how
water got on earth.

829
00:32:04,570 --> 00:32:07,780
They came from thinking came from
comments cause when you see comments,

830
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:12,130
comments are all water and I think like
millions of years of us can hammered by

831
00:32:12,131 --> 00:32:13,130
comments.
Huh?

832
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:15,160
Like you know when you see the trails of
comments,

833
00:32:15,161 --> 00:32:20,020
that's literally ice D and debris coming
off of that comment.

834
00:32:20,050 --> 00:32:21,110
I didn't know that.
Yeah.

835
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,760
Literally the more you know,
the more you know,

836
00:32:23,761 --> 00:32:28,450
been in a comment,
but they think that about mushrooms as

837
00:32:28,451 --> 00:32:31,630
well.
They think that spores can survive in a

838
00:32:31,631 --> 00:32:34,540
vacuum.
So if something like,

839
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:39,600
say if some spores were attached to a
rover and we shot off to move to

840
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:43,190
the moon or something like that and it
got there somehow or another,

841
00:32:43,191 --> 00:32:45,770
if there was the right conditions for
that thing to grow,

842
00:32:45,771 --> 00:32:50,771
that they could actually survive the
trip and then grow on the moon or on

843
00:32:50,870 --> 00:32:53,990
Mars or anywhere where it be water and
sunlight and atmosphere,

844
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:57,650
like invasion of the body snatchers,
we'll spores or even weirder,

845
00:32:57,651 --> 00:32:59,720
right?
Because spores create mushrooms and

846
00:32:59,721 --> 00:33:03,650
mushrooms actually breathed oxygen and
you breathe out carbon dioxide.

847
00:33:04,130 --> 00:33:06,150
They say they're,
they're closer to an animal than the art

848
00:33:06,151 --> 00:33:07,280
of vegetables.
Yeah.

849
00:33:07,370 --> 00:33:08,620
That's uh,
that's,

850
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:12,380
I've thought about that when I've,
when I've eaten magic mushrooms a lot.

851
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:14,330
Right.
It's like I basically just ate an

852
00:33:14,331 --> 00:33:15,111
animal.
Well,

853
00:33:15,111 --> 00:33:20,111
you also feel like it's taking like it's
alive inside of you communicating with

854
00:33:20,271 --> 00:33:22,190
you.
Right.

855
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:24,680
Don't you feel like that?
Like it's not as simple as I'm getting

856
00:33:24,681 --> 00:33:25,570
high.
No,

857
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:27,830
I smoke weed.
I feel like I'm getting high when I eat

858
00:33:27,831 --> 00:33:28,280
mushrooms.

859
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:31,880
I feel like I'm entering into the
thought process of an alien creature.

860
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:32,900
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

861
00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:34,880
You,
you put on like a space suit on the

862
00:33:34,881 --> 00:33:39,590
inside in a way and you're,
you're evolving a certain way if only

863
00:33:39,591 --> 00:33:41,660
for like seven or eight hours or
something.

864
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:44,390
Yeah.
Do you ever micro dose now?

865
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:47,570
I have friends that do that and Ron
White's big into that.

866
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:48,210
Oh,
Izzy,

867
00:33:48,210 --> 00:33:50,590
every day
you laugh.

868
00:33:50,591 --> 00:33:52,700
Found my sale.
But good kind of medicine.

869
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:53,990
Oh my God.
Ron.

870
00:33:54,050 --> 00:33:55,550
Ron White kills me,
man.

871
00:33:55,610 --> 00:33:58,670
I could just pick their most random name
you could have,

872
00:33:58,671 --> 00:34:00,710
but I'm just like,
that makes perfect sense.

873
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,660
He's beautiful.
He's,

874
00:34:02,810 --> 00:34:07,310
he's a real comedian.
In that he's always a mess.

875
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,560
He's beautiful.
He's always hilarious.

876
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:12,440
Yes.
Relationships are always full chaos.

877
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:13,970
Chaos.
He's always drunk.

878
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,280
He's always a peach.
He's always the nicest,

879
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:19,400
nicest.
He's never had any attitude with any

880
00:34:19,401 --> 00:34:20,240
comedian ever.

881
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:21,470
And always just,
he's,

882
00:34:21,471 --> 00:34:22,304
he's,
he's like,

883
00:34:22,370 --> 00:34:24,770
he's like America is wise.
Crack and drunk uncle.

884
00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:26,060
Yeah,
but not racist.

885
00:34:26,090 --> 00:34:27,110
No,
no,

886
00:34:27,170 --> 00:34:28,170
he's beautiful.
Yeah.

887
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:29,510
I love that guy.
Me Too.

888
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:30,890
Me Too.
I,

889
00:34:31,130 --> 00:34:32,330
it was almost like,
you know,

890
00:34:32,331 --> 00:34:33,510
there are certain,
uh,

891
00:34:33,950 --> 00:34:36,770
mystical gateways and,
and signs you see that are like,

892
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:37,071
oh,
hey,

893
00:34:37,071 --> 00:34:40,460
things are going to be okay.
I saw the magic monkey in the tree.

894
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:44,510
I landed in Las Vegas with my wife and
she loves vegas and we went to the cab

895
00:34:44,511 --> 00:34:48,710
line and just standing there as ron
white smoking a cigar as if the city put

896
00:34:48,711 --> 00:34:49,590
him.
They're like,

897
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:51,120
he's waiting for them.
Albany,

898
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:53,810
which is their people,
which they should,

899
00:34:53,811 --> 00:34:55,730
you know,
that they should just make a ron white

900
00:34:55,731 --> 00:34:58,670
hologram as you drive into the city
where he's there all the time.

901
00:34:58,850 --> 00:35:00,800
[inaudible].
He's there all the time during,

902
00:35:00,801 --> 00:35:01,970
um,
the Rodeo,

903
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,120
if you're in there,
you're in town for the Rodeo.

904
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:06,070
Ron White's at the Mirage.
That's usually match.

905
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:07,880
My wife's birthday's in,
uh,

906
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:10,730
in early December and that's always on
the Rodeo is that clubs.

907
00:35:10,731 --> 00:35:11,930
Awesome.
Do you ever do work?

908
00:35:11,931 --> 00:35:13,640
The Mirage you ever go there?
Uh,

909
00:35:13,641 --> 00:35:16,490
I've,
I opened for tosh there.

910
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:18,300
Yeah.
The Terry fator theater.

911
00:35:18,301 --> 00:35:20,110
Yes.
That's a bad ass place.

912
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:24,590
That's like a perfect,
perfect size theater for comedy.

913
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:26,240
Yeah.
It's like a thousand seats.

914
00:35:26,241 --> 00:35:28,580
Not too big,
but it's all like right in front of you.

915
00:35:28,610 --> 00:35:30,740
Yep.
I used to work the place where they do

916
00:35:30,741 --> 00:35:32,330
the uh,
um,

917
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:35,540
the car theater where they do the Cirque
de Solei.

918
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:38,130
Oh yeah.
But it's too cavernous.

919
00:35:38,131 --> 00:35:38,970
Yeah.
Like you,

920
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:42,480
you actually cost me money to work at
the Mirage and I'd rather do that cause

921
00:35:42,481 --> 00:35:43,560
then it's fun.
Yeah.

922
00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:46,740
That would be one was just too big.
That's what people don't think about in

923
00:35:46,741 --> 00:35:48,690
terms of,
I think like we only think about that.

924
00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:52,590
Comedians and promoters like the,
the architecture of a good comedy room,

925
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:53,550
you know,
like judge.

926
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:54,840
Generally speaking,
comedy clubs,

927
00:35:54,841 --> 00:35:58,440
lower ceiling like the or the or at the
comedy store.

928
00:35:58,441 --> 00:35:59,280
Yeah.
Perfect.

929
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,590
Do you ever do comedy works in Denver?
Yeah.

930
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:04,500
Loved Chellus flawless flood.
They nailed it.

931
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:05,230
Yeah.
Boy.

932
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:06,660
Your comedy store?
Yes.

933
00:36:06,690 --> 00:36:08,780
Flawless.
Acme in Minneapolis.

934
00:36:09,570 --> 00:36:11,550
He's got a few pillars that are a little
annoying.

935
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:12,690
That's true.
That's true.

936
00:36:12,691 --> 00:36:15,270
It's a huge building,
but the ceiling height is just right.

937
00:36:15,271 --> 00:36:16,470
Yeah.
Wide Ass pillars.

938
00:36:16,471 --> 00:36:17,790
You're like,
what if I'm sitting right here?

939
00:36:17,791 --> 00:36:20,130
I got to do this to watch the show.
I got to lean left.

940
00:36:20,370 --> 00:36:23,370
You worry about who's behind it.
It's like doing comedy in the round.

941
00:36:23,371 --> 00:36:25,350
I'm always like,
I feel like I have to keep spinning.

942
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:28,470
You know?
I've only done that a couple times and

943
00:36:28,471 --> 00:36:29,970
it always feels weird.
I hate it.

944
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:32,820
I need people in front of me.
Yeah,

945
00:36:32,821 --> 00:36:33,860
it's awkward.
Uh Huh.

946
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:35,670
Yeah.
This is a good theater in Phoenix

947
00:36:35,671 --> 00:36:37,020
though.
The Hollywood theater,

948
00:36:37,021 --> 00:36:40,830
they do that in the round.
Louie did one of his specials there.

949
00:36:40,831 --> 00:36:42,420
One of his hps.
Oh right.

950
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:42,880
Yeah,
yeah,

951
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,800
yeah,
I remember that one.

952
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,150
Yeah,
that was,

953
00:36:45,490 --> 00:36:48,120
that's crazy.
Cause that's huge theater and around,

954
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:53,390
it's not that big.
Really think it's 2,900 okay.

955
00:36:54,270 --> 00:36:59,270
I don't even think it's that big.
It might not even be 2,900 maybe 2,700

956
00:36:59,641 --> 00:37:00,720
find out young.
Jamie,

957
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:04,620
maybe I'm wrong,
but I know Sebastian,

958
00:37:04,621 --> 00:37:07,110
I think he did theater in the round in
Madison Square Garden.

959
00:37:07,111 --> 00:37:10,650
God bless that 18 teen thousand Jesus,
four shows.

960
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:12,490
Boom.
So good.

961
00:37:12,870 --> 00:37:13,740
Boom,
boom.

962
00:37:13,770 --> 00:37:16,740
He's one of those guys that like back
when no one knew where he was,

963
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:17,940
who he was,
you know,

964
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:21,960
three years ago or so.
Like I would make a point to stick

965
00:37:21,961 --> 00:37:24,030
around and watch him at the store cause
he's so fun.

966
00:37:24,270 --> 00:37:27,300
He's a great guy too.
He's another guy like no one begrudges.

967
00:37:27,301 --> 00:37:28,320
If you've a grudge,
Grat,

968
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:31,180
Sebastian has success,
you're probably a shithead.

969
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,970
Well and you probably don't like fun.
Yeah.

970
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,600
You know I have such a blast watching
him cause it's just,

971
00:37:36,601 --> 00:37:38,490
it's like he's like a silly ballet
dancer.

972
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:40,500
Yeah.
Making up all these,

973
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:45,680
all these stories and his facial
expressions and how he,

974
00:37:45,850 --> 00:37:46,501
uh,
his,

975
00:37:46,501 --> 00:37:48,630
his physical comedy.
It's just par.

976
00:37:48,631 --> 00:37:50,070
Exsalonce I love it.
Yeah.

977
00:37:50,071 --> 00:37:54,450
And he's always annoyed.
Everything is annoying to him.

978
00:37:54,451 --> 00:37:56,060
Like that's this whole thing.
Yeah.

979
00:37:56,061 --> 00:37:57,360
Yeah.
It's everything around.

980
00:37:57,361 --> 00:37:59,010
It just pisses him off.
Yeah.

981
00:37:59,011 --> 00:38:02,580
If you ever achieved peace,
like peace of mind would be terrible.

982
00:38:02,870 --> 00:38:05,460
Awful for is what would you do?
Yeah.

983
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:07,680
You know,
I used to legit think about that when I

984
00:38:07,681 --> 00:38:09,750
was starting out,
when I was starting to do comedy,

985
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:12,930
like a,
I wanted to meditate and to try to do

986
00:38:12,931 --> 00:38:14,730
these different things,
but I thought that's gotta be bad for

987
00:38:14,731 --> 00:38:15,564
your act.

988
00:38:15,570 --> 00:38:16,920
I should probably not.
That's crazy.

989
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:18,060
Yeah.
I know.

990
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:19,470
I remember guys saying like,
Oh,

991
00:38:19,471 --> 00:38:20,640
don't,
don't be healthy.

992
00:38:21,010 --> 00:38:23,190
It's bad for your act.
You want to feel like shit.

993
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,900
Yeah.
The only time you feel good is when

994
00:38:24,901 --> 00:38:25,800
you're drunk.
Right.

995
00:38:25,910 --> 00:38:28,890
That's it.
You want it to be depressed or be angry

996
00:38:28,891 --> 00:38:32,220
and lonely to smoke cigarettes
desperately need their attention on

997
00:38:32,221 --> 00:38:33,054
stage.
Yep.

998
00:38:33,170 --> 00:38:34,440
No worries.
The only place you live,

999
00:38:34,441 --> 00:38:35,860
we're all fucked.
Who Cares?

1000
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,660
Well,
some of my favorite acts were like

1001
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,400
really depressed,
like Richard Jennings,

1002
00:38:39,410 --> 00:38:42,580
one of my all time favorite acts.
It was super depressed when I'm killing

1003
00:38:42,581 --> 00:38:43,740
himself,
you know,

1004
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:45,160
and just like,
God dammit.

1005
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:46,780
It was,
it was maddening when I,

1006
00:38:46,930 --> 00:38:48,620
when I heard the news,
because he's one of those cues,

1007
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:51,040
one of those go tos that I could just,
you know,

1008
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:53,860
I get fed up with comedians that aren't
fans anymore,

1009
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:57,470
or a guy in Chicago who,
ah,

1010
00:38:57,690 --> 00:38:58,820
you ever have those people,
you,

1011
00:38:58,821 --> 00:39:01,630
you start out around and you're like,
you just look at them and you never stay

1012
00:39:01,631 --> 00:39:03,220
up and you're like,
I never want to be you man.

1013
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:05,080
Never.
And he would be the back and just go,

1014
00:39:05,081 --> 00:39:06,370
we'd go,
HAH,

1015
00:39:06,790 --> 00:39:08,050
funny.
Like,

1016
00:39:08,051 --> 00:39:11,170
is it because you didn't laugh?
You made a noise like laughter.

1017
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:15,130
But you see everything is a competition.
And I love,

1018
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:17,560
I love watching good comics,
whoever they are.

1019
00:39:17,561 --> 00:39:19,880
And like Jenny,
Jenny was one of those guys were just

1020
00:39:19,881 --> 00:39:21,310
like,
this guy's an ace.

1021
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:22,900
You're like Brian Regan.
Or it's like,

1022
00:39:22,930 --> 00:39:26,150
I'm never not going to laugh.
He's such a sweetheart too.

1023
00:39:26,830 --> 00:39:30,010
We've talked about this in the podcast
and I think what that came from was

1024
00:39:30,011 --> 00:39:34,300
there was a famine mentality that
existed in like the eighties and the

1025
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:37,030
nineties because the only way you can
become successful is if you got on the

1026
00:39:37,031 --> 00:39:41,080
tonight show and there was only one slot
at night and there's only five nights a

1027
00:39:41,081 --> 00:39:42,970
week.
And then if they don't know,

1028
00:39:42,971 --> 00:39:46,120
always have comics on either.
And then the only other way you would

1029
00:39:46,121 --> 00:39:48,040
get successful is if you've got to sit
calm.

1030
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:50,380
Right?
Or you got an HBO special,

1031
00:39:50,381 --> 00:39:52,570
which only famous people got,
right.

1032
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:53,560
Yeah.
That was the,

1033
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:58,420
that was the highest would be Seinfeld
or Kennison or someone big to get an hbo

1034
00:39:58,421 --> 00:40:00,220
special.
So for a regular small,

1035
00:40:00,221 --> 00:40:03,280
like you were I back then it was like,
what do you do?

1036
00:40:03,281 --> 00:40:05,920
How do you make it so everybody was dog
eat dog.

1037
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:07,210
Yeah.
It was all,

1038
00:40:07,570 --> 00:40:12,570
and I think somewhere along the line,
the early to mid two thousands that

1039
00:40:12,911 --> 00:40:15,250
shifted and it shifted because of the
Internet.

1040
00:40:15,850 --> 00:40:16,980
That's true,
isn't it?

1041
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:18,250
It is.
It is an internet.

1042
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:20,680
I kind of thought of it as an organic
thing from,

1043
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:21,980
you know,
because uh,

1044
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:25,210
the comedy boom happened because disco
died and you could basically fill a,

1045
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:28,100
a,
a huge room with just a spotlight and a

1046
00:40:28,101 --> 00:40:29,650
Mike and one dude,
you know,

1047
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:31,780
uh,
and these guys still have that space and

1048
00:40:31,781 --> 00:40:34,030
they were just raking in hand over fist
because people just,

1049
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:35,980
they didn't want to disco dance anymore
and it did,

1050
00:40:35,981 --> 00:40:37,420
it just died a horrible death.

1051
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:40,330
There was too much a cliche.
Everyone,

1052
00:40:40,331 --> 00:40:43,930
cocaine and everyone did disco.
Like Kenny Rogers did a disco song.

1053
00:40:43,931 --> 00:40:46,550
It was just like everybody kissed a
disco song.

1054
00:40:46,570 --> 00:40:50,350
I know.
And so I thought it was because that

1055
00:40:50,351 --> 00:40:54,940
kind of faded out.
We kind of just came to our senses as

1056
00:40:54,941 --> 00:40:56,410
audience members and Comedians.
But you're right,

1057
00:40:56,411 --> 00:40:58,150
it is the Internet.
That's what changed it.

1058
00:40:58,170 --> 00:41:00,220
Well,
the Internet came along and comics

1059
00:41:00,221 --> 00:41:04,330
started promoting themselves and someone
who really deserves a lot of credit is

1060
00:41:04,331 --> 00:41:07,150
Dane Cook for sure.
Dane Cook was the first guy to really

1061
00:41:07,151 --> 00:41:10,270
become famous through the Internet.
And then everyone,

1062
00:41:10,271 --> 00:41:12,340
including me,
started paying attention going,

1063
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:15,760
oh,
this is another way.

1064
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:19,900
Even though there is the regular way of
television shows and movies and all that

1065
00:41:19,901 --> 00:41:21,730
stuff.
There's this way to in this way,

1066
00:41:21,731 --> 00:41:25,990
just made at the time he was the biggest
selling comedian of all time.

1067
00:41:26,010 --> 00:41:27,880
Yeah.
He spent like 20 grand on a website,

1068
00:41:27,910 --> 00:41:31,050
which to me at the time I was like,
who has that kind of money that's and

1069
00:41:31,051 --> 00:41:34,130
why buy a car?
But he was the smart

1070
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:36,380
one and he also spent all day day

1071
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:39,260
responding to people online and then,
you know,

1072
00:41:39,261 --> 00:41:44,261
built up this reputation for doing that
and then promoted the shit out of

1073
00:41:44,361 --> 00:41:48,560
himself through my space and all these
different ways that he promoted,

1074
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:50,540
you know,
the shows instead and then became

1075
00:41:50,541 --> 00:41:51,350
gigantic.
Yeah.

1076
00:41:51,350 --> 00:41:55,820
And then everyone else around 2003 or
four that's when we all started to jump

1077
00:41:55,821 --> 00:42:00,620
in and comics had my space accounts and
comics had facebook pages and,

1078
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:01,611
and I,
you know,

1079
00:42:01,611 --> 00:42:04,460
I had a website in the 90s I had a
website way back in the night,

1080
00:42:04,461 --> 00:42:07,820
but I basically just wrote blogs on it
and had a message board and fucked

1081
00:42:07,821 --> 00:42:11,750
around in the message board.
But what he did was use it as a business

1082
00:42:11,751 --> 00:42:12,530
vehicle.
Right.

1083
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:14,480
Like in a way to actively promote
himself.

1084
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:19,310
So then somewhere in the mid two
thousands comics started doing internet

1085
00:42:19,311 --> 00:42:23,000
things like little internet shows,
like crackle was a thing and they were

1086
00:42:23,001 --> 00:42:26,570
doing little online things and then
people were working with each other

1087
00:42:26,571 --> 00:42:28,820
more.
So instead of comics being like

1088
00:42:28,821 --> 00:42:29,920
competition,
there were,

1089
00:42:29,921 --> 00:42:32,600
there was camaraderie,
we were doing each other's stuff.

1090
00:42:32,601 --> 00:42:35,060
And then podcasting took it over the
top.

1091
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:36,950
Yes.
Once that happened then everybody

1092
00:42:36,951 --> 00:42:37,371
realized,
Oh,

1093
00:42:37,371 --> 00:42:38,810
you could really help each other.

1094
00:42:38,930 --> 00:42:40,400
Yeah.
And you don't have to use,

1095
00:42:40,401 --> 00:42:42,470
I feel like in between there,
uh,

1096
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:44,990
one thing you,
one thing you left out was the amount of

1097
00:42:45,110 --> 00:42:46,940
the rise of what you call the Internet
comedian,

1098
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:50,510
which where they just kind of would make
blogs and they had people that would

1099
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:52,780
edit them so that they would be funny.
Yeah.

1100
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:55,850
Like you and I have come up over,
you know,

1101
00:42:55,851 --> 00:42:59,150
20 odd years doing standup where you
learn timing,

1102
00:42:59,151 --> 00:43:01,280
you learn how to read an audience to ebb
and the flow,

1103
00:43:01,281 --> 00:43:04,010
your brain waves and how to pick when to
say something.

1104
00:43:04,011 --> 00:43:04,970
And how,
you know,

1105
00:43:04,971 --> 00:43:07,640
because timing is everything with,
with uh,

1106
00:43:07,641 --> 00:43:09,800
an Internet video,
you can have an editor just go,

1107
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:10,370
nope,
here,

1108
00:43:10,370 --> 00:43:10,851
here,
here,

1109
00:43:10,851 --> 00:43:12,260
here.
He should have said that faster.

1110
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:15,350
And it,
it's this thing that kind of vaunted

1111
00:43:15,351 --> 00:43:16,910
these kids into,
you know,

1112
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:22,060
youtube millionaires if they were lucky,
but sometimes they'd go on the road and

1113
00:43:22,281 --> 00:43:25,970
people were like something that's going
on and every single time they'd eat

1114
00:43:25,971 --> 00:43:26,900
plates of Shit.

1115
00:43:27,470 --> 00:43:30,500
Like you can't just do,
that's like learning karate in your

1116
00:43:30,501 --> 00:43:32,300
basement.
Practicing in the mirror.

1117
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:33,950
Yeah.
And then going to fight in a tournament.

1118
00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:35,820
It's like those guys I saw that,
that,

1119
00:43:35,830 --> 00:43:37,250
that,
that you put up online of those,

1120
00:43:37,251 --> 00:43:38,600
those,
those tutorials,

1121
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:40,820
horrible tutorial,
fake martial or come at me,

1122
00:43:42,330 --> 00:43:46,880
it's like that guy entering the squared
circle with someone who knows what he's

1123
00:43:46,881 --> 00:43:49,340
doing.
Are they still doing that style of video

1124
00:43:49,341 --> 00:43:53,150
where the edit constantly and make those
youtube videos where it's constant edit,

1125
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:53,740
edit,
edit,

1126
00:43:53,740 --> 00:43:54,573
edit,
edit,

1127
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:57,740
where they cut out all the pauses.
Is that still a thing?

1128
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:00,620
I mean it's her,
there's all sorts of styles on youtube.

1129
00:44:00,621 --> 00:44:02,360
Shit.
I could find you a hundred videos of

1130
00:44:02,361 --> 00:44:02,880
that.
Yeah,

1131
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:04,550
yeah.
I remember when that was like the

1132
00:44:04,551 --> 00:44:07,250
primary way these people were doing
these blogs.

1133
00:44:07,251 --> 00:44:08,600
Everybody had,
it was like,

1134
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:10,000
then you have blah,
blah.

1135
00:44:10,250 --> 00:44:12,380
Everything was edited and it would cut
to,

1136
00:44:12,381 --> 00:44:14,270
it's almost like watching,
watching family guy,

1137
00:44:14,670 --> 00:44:15,520
uh,
you know,

1138
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:18,140
Peter would be like,
that's my time I was into disco and it

1139
00:44:18,141 --> 00:44:20,390
cuts to him and he's like,
jacking off on a disco for this cuts

1140
00:44:20,391 --> 00:44:21,200
back.
You know,

1141
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,910
it was like that because you could just
do that.

1142
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:25,940
We have to say it on stage.
We have to have a segway and blah,

1143
00:44:25,941 --> 00:44:26,271
blah,
blah.

1144
00:44:26,271 --> 00:44:30,770
We can't just hit a click and then you
cut to me beating off and then back to

1145
00:44:30,771 --> 00:44:34,200
me in the audience.
I've watched a couple people recently

1146
00:44:34,230 --> 00:44:38,550
tried to transfer that,
doing stuff in front of a microphone in

1147
00:44:38,551 --> 00:44:41,880
front of a video camera to going on
stage for the first time.

1148
00:44:41,910 --> 00:44:44,220
I've watched the Aha.
It's terrifying.

1149
00:44:44,250 --> 00:44:45,510
It's terrifying.
Uh,

1150
00:44:45,511 --> 00:44:46,370
and,
and it,

1151
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:50,430
it kind of breaks the covenant of an
audience because anytime,

1152
00:44:50,431 --> 00:44:51,390
like I have a,
I have a,

1153
00:44:51,391 --> 00:44:53,040
an opener who's like,
they're like,

1154
00:44:53,390 --> 00:44:54,840
I'm actually fucking nervous and blah,
blah,

1155
00:44:54,841 --> 00:44:55,140
blah.

1156
00:44:55,140 --> 00:44:56,190
You know,
do you still get nervous?

1157
00:44:56,191 --> 00:44:56,581
And I'm like,
yeah,

1158
00:44:56,581 --> 00:44:57,780
of course.
Of course.

1159
00:44:57,930 --> 00:45:00,990
I'd be a sociopath if I didn't get
nervous almost every time.

1160
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:02,490
But you know,
you just,

1161
00:45:02,510 --> 00:45:05,550
you fight through it and it's fine.
But I always tell him,

1162
00:45:05,610 --> 00:45:07,320
look man,
the audience is rooting for you.

1163
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:09,590
Like they want you to do good.
You know,

1164
00:45:10,170 --> 00:45:12,900
that's the thing that people forget.
They think they think every time you're

1165
00:45:12,901 --> 00:45:13,440
on the road,
it's,

1166
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:16,590
it's an away game.
Unless you're a hot girl.

1167
00:45:17,610 --> 00:45:20,370
Yeah.
That's who you are owed for standing up.

1168
00:45:20,371 --> 00:45:23,910
There's a hot girl,
hot girl with like showing some cleavage

1169
00:45:23,911 --> 00:45:26,010
with a skirt.
Good fucking luck.

1170
00:45:26,030 --> 00:45:27,690
Yeah,
because guys just don't take them

1171
00:45:27,691 --> 00:45:29,090
seriously.
That sucks to be like,

1172
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:30,330
what?
You're funny too.

1173
00:45:30,331 --> 00:45:32,520
I'm phony than you and not gonna hold
on.

1174
00:45:32,521 --> 00:45:33,510
Yeah.
Fuck it.

1175
00:45:33,511 --> 00:45:35,310
Fuck you.
Maybe would look judge odor.

1176
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:35,700
That's it.

1177
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:37,320
Yeah.
That's a perfect male privilege.

1178
00:45:37,321 --> 00:45:39,300
Like,
that's not what I want from you.

1179
00:45:39,660 --> 00:45:42,150
I want sex.
Well there's,

1180
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:46,890
that's a weird look to like a girl with
like long legs and a mini skirt and high

1181
00:45:46,891 --> 00:45:49,290
heels on stage telling jokes.
It is strange.

1182
00:45:49,291 --> 00:45:50,340
That doesn't work well.
You're,

1183
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:53,850
you're overly attractive comedian.
Male or female has always been a little

1184
00:45:53,851 --> 00:45:54,684
weird to me.
Yes,

1185
00:45:54,690 --> 00:45:57,120
there are people that are undeniable and
I'm like,

1186
00:45:57,121 --> 00:45:58,470
all right,
cool.

1187
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:01,020
You know,
but it's like part of me kind of little

1188
00:46:01,021 --> 00:46:02,620
too handsome.
Their fellow tooth there.

1189
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:05,280
There was a guy who,
when kyle and I moved to La and we were

1190
00:46:05,281 --> 00:46:07,200
roommates,
there's a guy that had a show and he was

1191
00:46:07,201 --> 00:46:10,680
a comedian and an a physical trainer and
he sent,

1192
00:46:10,681 --> 00:46:12,930
he emailed both of us,
like,

1193
00:46:12,931 --> 00:46:13,381
we were like,
Hey,

1194
00:46:13,381 --> 00:46:16,650
can we get booked on your show?
And he emailed both of us just,

1195
00:46:16,970 --> 00:46:19,410
she must take an every email,
uh,

1196
00:46:19,411 --> 00:46:20,244
in his,
in his,

1197
00:46:20,310 --> 00:46:21,870
in his book and just sent it out.

1198
00:46:21,870 --> 00:46:23,610
A blast of he is,
if you need,

1199
00:46:23,730 --> 00:46:26,280
if you need to get fit.
And the picture was a picture of him

1200
00:46:26,281 --> 00:46:28,090
shirtless under a waterfall.
Like,

1201
00:46:28,110 --> 00:46:31,230
hey,
someone's coming at him.

1202
00:46:31,231 --> 00:46:32,850
And I was like,
fuck this guy.

1203
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:36,000
And as I say,
fuck this guy kyle and all caps goes,

1204
00:46:36,001 --> 00:46:38,610
take me off your list and just sends it.
That's all he said.

1205
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,230
Cause I was like,
oh waterfall this,

1206
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:43,710
this.
Looking at waterfall,

1207
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:48,390
I'm so in touch with nature.
Sometimes I go backpacking by myself.

1208
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:49,263
My,
my,

1209
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:53,250
my favorite are probably one of my top
five onion headlines was a,

1210
00:46:53,260 --> 00:46:56,910
the trucker guide is like why do those
homosexuals keeps sucking my cock?

1211
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:00,930
And he read the article,
one of them,

1212
00:47:01,170 --> 00:47:04,140
the second paragraph was,
I'm just hanging out with a bro under a

1213
00:47:04,141 --> 00:47:05,880
waterfall.
We're enjoying the day.

1214
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:09,510
All of a sudden he's sucking my cock.
Hey Bro,

1215
00:47:09,570 --> 00:47:12,700
under a waterfall that every time,
yeah,

1216
00:47:12,730 --> 00:47:15,660
men under waterfalls with their head
back.

1217
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:20,520
Like especially if they have long hair
flowing through their locks and they

1218
00:47:20,521 --> 00:47:22,480
tighten up their abs so you can see the
abs real.

1219
00:47:22,481 --> 00:47:23,131
Okay.
Yeah.

1220
00:47:23,131 --> 00:47:24,090
And it's like,
did you take it?

1221
00:47:24,150 --> 00:47:26,040
Did you take it up?
I'm still,

1222
00:47:26,041 --> 00:47:28,770
I'm flexing my core as hard as I can.
Let me know when you're done.

1223
00:47:28,930 --> 00:47:30,220
It's super spiritual.

1224
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:35,220
Gut comes out basically plant based,
super spiritual out here.

1225
00:47:35,650 --> 00:47:37,030
There wasn't near.
He is.

1226
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:40,930
That guy has taken it in the mouth.
That's like a kid that's like a kid in

1227
00:47:40,931 --> 00:47:42,170
Thailand.
That's like a,

1228
00:47:42,171 --> 00:47:45,160
an elephant coming on.
What do you like the muscular white

1229
00:47:45,161 --> 00:47:48,220
dude.
See that as more like a handsome man

1230
00:47:48,221 --> 00:47:49,630
feeling good.
I'll get a girl,

1231
00:47:49,780 --> 00:47:51,610
but it doesn't bother me at all.
When a girl is doing it,

1232
00:47:51,650 --> 00:47:54,940
get that girl back.
I'll get her to go grow.

1233
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:56,740
So strange.
Live your best life

1234
00:47:58,300 --> 00:48:01,330
under that waterfall.
It doesn't bother me at all.

1235
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:04,300
I see a girl under a waterfall with her
hair back like that.

1236
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:07,540
Not even a tinge of disgust.
I don't see,

1237
00:48:07,541 --> 00:48:09,470
I don't even mind the guy under the wall
like that guys.

1238
00:48:09,490 --> 00:48:10,570
Just having fun.
Yeah.

1239
00:48:10,590 --> 00:48:12,250
That guy's not like he's not going.
Wait.

1240
00:48:12,251 --> 00:48:13,084
What are you doing?
Look at me.

1241
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:14,380
Come back.
He's not being honest.

1242
00:48:14,390 --> 00:48:17,890
Your spiritual man like the one below it
with his arms down right below there.

1243
00:48:17,950 --> 00:48:19,570
Jamie on the bottom.
Bottom row.

1244
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:22,660
Yeah.
That guy looks he's having a good time.

1245
00:48:23,250 --> 00:48:25,220
That's a fun dude.
Fucking party.

1246
00:48:25,420 --> 00:48:28,810
Super High.
Why the world needs happy men.

1247
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:30,910
That's the,
what kind of fucking article is that?

1248
00:48:31,030 --> 00:48:32,500
I mean,
who wrote that?

1249
00:48:32,501 --> 00:48:34,330
Some depressed dude,
right about to shoot himself.

1250
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:37,750
He's got a gun sitting on,
on the desk right next to the laptops.

1251
00:48:37,780 --> 00:48:39,580
Like why the world needs happy man.

1252
00:48:42,110 --> 00:48:43,600
I'm trying to think of it right.
It's like,

1253
00:48:43,601 --> 00:48:44,830
yeah,
we'll come back guy.

1254
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:46,710
That dude's a ride.
Yeah.

1255
00:48:46,750 --> 00:48:48,160
Fat.
That's,

1256
00:48:48,190 --> 00:48:49,900
Oh,
Bert wishes he was that his kidney

1257
00:48:49,930 --> 00:48:54,930
dangerous amount of berry.
Burt fucking loses all this weight.

1258
00:48:56,381 --> 00:49:00,520
Every year we do this weight loss thing.
Toby follow along.

1259
00:49:00,521 --> 00:49:02,830
You're crazy.
You see with the hot yoga and he fucking

1260
00:49:02,831 --> 00:49:04,290
gains it all back every year.
Yeah.

1261
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:07,290
Every year I saw him at soul cycle with
this wise fuck.

1262
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:08,380
Yeah.
And he just,

1263
00:49:08,770 --> 00:49:11,170
I mean that's unbelievable.
He keeps telling me,

1264
00:49:11,171 --> 00:49:14,230
cause he sent,
he sent out a mass text test the other

1265
00:49:14,230 --> 00:49:16,240
day that we have,
there's a group on my phone called the

1266
00:49:16,241 --> 00:49:19,750
sober October group.
It is one of the best text message

1267
00:49:19,751 --> 00:49:21,220
threads ever.
It's ruthless.

1268
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:22,520
Yeah.
It's Sigora,

1269
00:49:22,570 --> 00:49:25,120
Ari,
me and Bert and uh,

1270
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:26,140
and look at,
um,

1271
00:49:26,140 --> 00:49:29,560
some kids burned with Bert Kreischer
that burn is not calories.

1272
00:49:29,770 --> 00:49:31,090
That's what's not burning.
No.

1273
00:49:31,190 --> 00:49:33,310
Um,
but he sent out this message of the day,

1274
00:49:33,311 --> 00:49:35,950
like,
I miss the heart rate monitors.

1275
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:42,640
It's really old drunk watching,
saving private Ryan.

1276
00:49:42,641 --> 00:49:44,110
So sensitive.
Fuck.

1277
00:49:44,111 --> 00:49:46,330
Am I doing man?
You guys,

1278
00:49:46,410 --> 00:49:47,770
you guys talking without me?
What are you doing?

1279
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:48,170
Yeah,
he's still,

1280
00:49:48,170 --> 00:49:49,710
he's like this.
What's going on over here?

1281
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:51,340
Hey guys,
I miss you guys.

1282
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:53,230
I love Birdman.
He goes out,

1283
00:49:53,260 --> 00:49:56,950
he'll do a comedy club and then go out
and tell everyone where he's going to

1284
00:49:56,951 --> 00:50:01,930
drink and then he meets them at the bar.
Takes the shirt off in Ottawa.

1285
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:06,060
It's like 150 degrees below zero.
He drinks with them all and then leaves.

1286
00:50:06,070 --> 00:50:06,421
He's like,
well,

1287
00:50:06,421 --> 00:50:07,780
I love you.
I love you.

1288
00:50:07,781 --> 00:50:09,460
I love you.
Then he gets in his tour bus.

1289
00:50:10,420 --> 00:50:11,440
I mean,
I don't,

1290
00:50:11,620 --> 00:50:14,080
I don't go to the second location,
you know,

1291
00:50:14,081 --> 00:50:15,640
I'll,
I'll hang out at the club a little bit,

1292
00:50:15,641 --> 00:50:18,310
take pictures of stuff.
The people and they have a beer,

1293
00:50:18,311 --> 00:50:19,810
but like people like,
hey,

1294
00:50:19,811 --> 00:50:20,800
you should go to our bar.

1295
00:50:20,830 --> 00:50:21,670
Nope.
Yeah,

1296
00:50:22,150 --> 00:50:24,100
I've done it in the past.
I used to in the past.

1297
00:50:24,101 --> 00:50:26,230
But after a while becomes untenable.
Yeah.

1298
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:28,190
You can't,
is there,

1299
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:31,070
you're playing like 5,000,
10,000 seaters now.

1300
00:50:31,550 --> 00:50:32,900
Yeah.
That's a lot of pictures.

1301
00:50:32,901 --> 00:50:34,790
You can't,
your I watch,

1302
00:50:35,270 --> 00:50:38,060
I watched Jo Koy hanging out with were
on like,

1303
00:50:38,270 --> 00:50:40,340
they're going to kill him.
Like they're going to pete,

1304
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:43,160
they're going to tear his clothes off.
Like Elvis used to almost get shredded

1305
00:50:43,161 --> 00:50:44,960
by female nails.
You know,

1306
00:50:44,961 --> 00:50:48,260
like there's so many people trying to
get a selfie with him and he just played

1307
00:50:48,261 --> 00:50:50,560
a stadium and he's just outside.
Wow.

1308
00:50:51,050 --> 00:50:53,030
Just like dude,
just Joe,

1309
00:50:53,060 --> 00:50:54,950
just careful security.
Yeah.

1310
00:50:54,951 --> 00:50:57,200
He's got,
he's got some people with him for sure.

1311
00:50:57,201 --> 00:51:00,290
But tasers,
Jesus,

1312
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:01,850
different,
uh,

1313
00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:02,601
different.
He has the,

1314
00:51:02,601 --> 00:51:04,970
there's like a lady Taser.
It's not as strong and there's like

1315
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:07,850
dude,
Taser for the various kinds of fans.

1316
00:51:07,850 --> 00:51:09,260
Yeah.
You gotta be careful,

1317
00:51:10,910 --> 00:51:12,380
but God bless him.
I mean,

1318
00:51:12,381 --> 00:51:15,290
that's kind of how he got that big.
The thing about burt's fans though is at

1319
00:51:15,291 --> 00:51:17,330
burt's fans were all drunk too,
right?

1320
00:51:17,331 --> 00:51:21,010
So they're probably not even going to
know what to do or you don't remember if

1321
00:51:21,050 --> 00:51:24,440
they were going to kidnap him.
They give it up on the meet him yet the

1322
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:27,530
next day they check their phone like no,
that's selfies all blurry and shit like,

1323
00:51:27,531 --> 00:51:29,630
yeah.
Well your hand was shaking from the dts

1324
00:51:29,631 --> 00:51:32,870
while you tried to take it.
So coming back to town real quick,

1325
00:51:32,871 --> 00:51:34,480
give me a self,
your mirror selfie.

1326
00:51:34,490 --> 00:51:37,190
Come on.
Tries to dress up my facebook.

1327
00:51:37,191 --> 00:51:39,870
My wife's not talking to me.
Burden a your jokes.

1328
00:51:39,910 --> 00:51:43,790
The only thing keeping me going and uh,
the heart's not too strong these days.

1329
00:51:44,090 --> 00:51:47,960
The doc doesn't say I have long,
so please don't come around right in

1330
00:51:47,961 --> 00:51:51,500
this article for vox about why the world
needs happy man.

1331
00:51:53,660 --> 00:51:57,330
Three bullets in the train by once every
six hours.

1332
00:51:57,800 --> 00:51:59,140
Russian roulette,
one bullet,

1333
00:51:59,180 --> 00:52:00,740
not mine boats.
Nah,

1334
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:03,200
not Verne's.
Not Verne's roulette mind with three

1335
00:52:03,201 --> 00:52:04,730
bullets.
I was thinking that the other day about

1336
00:52:04,731 --> 00:52:06,560
marriage.
That marriage is essentially Russian

1337
00:52:06,561 --> 00:52:11,060
roulette with three bullets
because one's going to die first.

1338
00:52:11,061 --> 00:52:13,540
50% of marriages end in divorce.
Oh,

1339
00:52:13,610 --> 00:52:15,590
and then there's the Chris rock line.
That's just,

1340
00:52:15,740 --> 00:52:17,270
he goes,
that's just the people that had the

1341
00:52:17,271 --> 00:52:18,830
courage to get out.
Yeah.

1342
00:52:18,850 --> 00:52:21,530
He was like,
how many cowards is stay and suffer.

1343
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:22,760
Yeah.
Yeah.

1344
00:52:22,850 --> 00:52:24,330
So true.
True Catholic.

1345
00:52:24,331 --> 00:52:25,370
So true.
Yeah,

1346
00:52:25,460 --> 00:52:27,020
and this is coming from a guy who's
happily married,

1347
00:52:27,580 --> 00:52:29,720
but that's when I,
when I see people who are about to get

1348
00:52:29,721 --> 00:52:30,260
married,
I go,

1349
00:52:30,260 --> 00:52:31,460
Oh,
good Lord.

1350
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:32,031
Yeah.
Well,

1351
00:52:32,031 --> 00:52:32,864
you're married.
Yeah.

1352
00:52:32,930 --> 00:52:34,460
As I said,
this is coming from a guy was happily

1353
00:52:34,461 --> 00:52:35,090
married.
Yeah.

1354
00:52:35,090 --> 00:52:35,960
Yeah.
It works.

1355
00:52:35,990 --> 00:52:37,610
It's just that you're talking about
Chris Rock and like,

1356
00:52:37,611 --> 00:52:38,444
oh,
he's divorced.

1357
00:52:38,540 --> 00:52:39,700
He's divorced.
No,

1358
00:52:39,770 --> 00:52:40,461
I mean,
but me,

1359
00:52:40,461 --> 00:52:41,930
I see people get married.
I'm like,

1360
00:52:42,590 --> 00:52:43,890
Oh yeah.
I always assume.

1361
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:45,880
I was telling people like,
yeah,

1362
00:52:45,890 --> 00:52:47,300
I'm married.
I'm happy.

1363
00:52:47,301 --> 00:52:48,410
I love it.
Don't do it.

1364
00:52:48,530 --> 00:52:49,760
Yeah,
don't do is too risky,

1365
00:52:49,761 --> 00:52:51,140
dude.
That's why I got to have you on advice

1366
00:52:51,141 --> 00:52:55,340
from a dipshit because Amanda will call
through and she'll get like marriage

1367
00:52:55,370 --> 00:52:57,620
advice.
We have a lot every single month that

1368
00:52:57,621 --> 00:52:59,570
people call in and say,
hey man,

1369
00:52:59,571 --> 00:53:00,600
should I,
should I,

1370
00:53:01,070 --> 00:53:04,370
you can't give people advice cause first
of all there is no fucking way I know

1371
00:53:04,371 --> 00:53:06,560
how you actually are together when
you're alone.

1372
00:53:06,620 --> 00:53:08,840
I don't know that,
but it's advice from a dipshit.

1373
00:53:08,970 --> 00:53:12,650
So basically I just go by myself and go,
just make sure you're doing this,

1374
00:53:12,651 --> 00:53:13,520
this,
this and this,

1375
00:53:13,521 --> 00:53:15,320
and then you're on your fucking own.
You know,

1376
00:53:15,820 --> 00:53:17,690
they're not quote me.
You should have doctor Laura on your

1377
00:53:17,691 --> 00:53:20,570
show ever be mean to my God.
Be Amazing.

1378
00:53:22,220 --> 00:53:23,720
I don't care.
She's so mean.

1379
00:53:23,721 --> 00:53:24,860
Yeah,
she's just brutal.

1380
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:26,040
He the meanest advice.

1381
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:26,810
Yeah,
that,

1382
00:53:26,810 --> 00:53:28,830
well,
I mean if I need to have more of those

1383
00:53:28,831 --> 00:53:31,530
tough love people on the show,
I always had these comics that,

1384
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:36,560
you know who it Santina was the meanest
once because a guy fucking big,

1385
00:53:38,311 --> 00:53:39,700
big Leprechaun.
He,

1386
00:53:39,810 --> 00:53:41,970
I had someone come on called it and was
like,

1387
00:53:41,971 --> 00:53:44,250
you know how he gets,
we usually curb these,

1388
00:53:44,251 --> 00:53:47,700
but like we get a lot of like,
how do I make it or when's the right

1389
00:53:47,701 --> 00:53:50,910
time to move to la or New York?
Never or whatever.

1390
00:53:50,911 --> 00:53:51,810
But like,
yeah,

1391
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:54,000
but it's the eighties it's like,
it's like,

1392
00:53:54,001 --> 00:53:54,900
I don't know man.
It's,

1393
00:53:54,901 --> 00:53:57,000
it's kind of up to you.
And this guy was like,

1394
00:53:57,001 --> 00:53:59,040
I've been doing it like 12 years or
something.

1395
00:53:59,041 --> 00:54:01,160
And Andrew was just like,
the message to be finished.

1396
00:54:01,170 --> 00:54:01,951
She goes,
I would give up,

1397
00:54:01,951 --> 00:54:03,540
man.
I would honestly give up because this

1398
00:54:03,541 --> 00:54:05,010
business will eat you alive.

1399
00:54:05,010 --> 00:54:06,600
And I don't,
and that is something,

1400
00:54:06,630 --> 00:54:08,910
I don't have the heart.
I'm a sensitive guy.

1401
00:54:08,970 --> 00:54:12,960
I don't have the heart to say that to
anyone to just say back it up and move

1402
00:54:12,961 --> 00:54:13,660
on.
You're,

1403
00:54:13,660 --> 00:54:14,880
it ain't for you.
You know?

1404
00:54:14,881 --> 00:54:16,650
But Andrea was saying that and it was
kind of like,

1405
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:17,040
yeah,
we're,

1406
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:18,720
I appreciated his honesty,
you know?

1407
00:54:18,860 --> 00:54:20,320
Well,
like I,

1408
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:25,650
I just think that it requires an
obsession.

1409
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:26,490
Yes.
I give,

1410
00:54:26,490 --> 00:54:31,260
you're not like fully obsessed.
You're probably not going to put the

1411
00:54:31,261 --> 00:54:33,930
thought process and the effort and do,
and you're not going to survive.

1412
00:54:33,931 --> 00:54:37,680
The bombings know the bombings like
their test your soul.

1413
00:54:38,670 --> 00:54:41,520
It's just nothing worse than feeling
that amount of hate.

1414
00:54:41,610 --> 00:54:42,301
Where,
where,

1415
00:54:42,301 --> 00:54:46,750
where I ever been in New York and a dead
silence and hearing a guy in the back,

1416
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:47,820
it'd be like,
Oh,

1417
00:54:47,821 --> 00:54:50,340
you fucking kidding me.
Can we fucking go home now?

1418
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:51,470
I mean,
Jesus Christ,

1419
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:53,500
like audibly,
audibly,

1420
00:54:53,770 --> 00:54:53,980
and the

1421
00:54:53,980 --> 00:54:55,330
silence.
Oh my God.

1422
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:58,390
I just,
and I hear that guy in my dreams.

1423
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:00,910
It is bombing on stage once and this guy
goes,

1424
00:55:00,911 --> 00:55:04,390
you're fucking terrible.
And I was like,

1425
00:55:04,391 --> 00:55:06,340
he's right.
It was nothing I could say.

1426
00:55:06,341 --> 00:55:09,250
I didn't never respond like not,
and I can say,

1427
00:55:09,251 --> 00:55:10,180
dude,
I'm with you.

1428
00:55:10,210 --> 00:55:12,140
I can't even pull myself out of this.
Yeah.

1429
00:55:12,220 --> 00:55:13,330
I got nothing.
Yeah,

1430
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:15,910
Dave,
I remember Patton Oswald being on stage

1431
00:55:15,911 --> 00:55:17,540
at the,
the first festival ever did was a

1432
00:55:17,541 --> 00:55:19,360
Chicago comedy festival.
And I found,

1433
00:55:19,390 --> 00:55:23,290
I found the booklet from it recently,
like cleaning out my house and,

1434
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:27,200
uh,
2001 and it was doug,

1435
00:55:27,220 --> 00:55:28,690
Stan Hope,
uh,

1436
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:30,770
swarts in,
uh,

1437
00:55:30,910 --> 00:55:34,300
Tosh Kyle.
Who else fucking,

1438
00:55:34,660 --> 00:55:36,100
uh,
built wire,

1439
00:55:36,170 --> 00:55:39,630
a bunch of random like awesome people,
but uh,

1440
00:55:39,670 --> 00:55:43,180
patents on stage and,
and Marin back when Marin's still drank.

1441
00:55:43,510 --> 00:55:45,640
I think that was the last time you drank
actually that weekend.

1442
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:50,760
Marin wasn't drinking back then,
man wasn't drinking way back in the 80s.

1443
00:55:51,790 --> 00:55:54,290
No d start drinking again.
Yes.

1444
00:55:54,490 --> 00:55:56,770
Oh,
that was like during the relapse period.

1445
00:55:57,530 --> 00:56:01,120
I remember it because he talks about
leaving the hotel and a friend who was

1446
00:56:01,121 --> 00:56:01,931
at the hotel was like,
yeah,

1447
00:56:01,931 --> 00:56:03,850
man,
when you left your luggage was sweating.

1448
00:56:04,030 --> 00:56:06,190
Like said it to me cause he was so hung
over.

1449
00:56:06,191 --> 00:56:08,320
But patent was like,
you know,

1450
00:56:08,321 --> 00:56:11,860
doing him and Marin were just dropping
in and places and this chick was so mad,

1451
00:56:11,861 --> 00:56:12,641
she got bumped.
She's like,

1452
00:56:12,641 --> 00:56:14,130
you fucking suck.
And,

1453
00:56:14,150 --> 00:56:15,970
and in fact it's like,
I agree with you.

1454
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:19,660
I agree with you.
If she was mad at him because she got

1455
00:56:19,670 --> 00:56:22,380
bumped and,
and so she was saying he sucked.

1456
00:56:22,381 --> 00:56:24,100
Yeah,
she's just at him from the audience and

1457
00:56:24,101 --> 00:56:25,570
like she just said,
you get up hunting.

1458
00:56:25,630 --> 00:56:27,340
Yeah.
Well I mean I was kind of like,

1459
00:56:27,341 --> 00:56:28,930
this is a free form room.

1460
00:56:29,470 --> 00:56:33,700
I got bumped but I get to watch Patton.
So she's a comic heckling.

1461
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:34,661
Ooh.
Oh,

1462
00:56:34,661 --> 00:56:37,430
I know she ever made it did show.
No Huh?

1463
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:40,060
Yeah,
I mean and and but it was that thing.

1464
00:56:40,061 --> 00:56:42,490
They were just like,
if you say I could be killing had been

1465
00:56:42,491 --> 00:56:44,800
one guy would be like,
this guy fucking blows.

1466
00:56:44,801 --> 00:56:47,090
And I'm like,
I believe that Guy Dan and I would go

1467
00:56:47,091 --> 00:56:48,640
one.
Oh that's the worst is when you're

1468
00:56:48,641 --> 00:56:50,350
killing.
You see one person in the front row like

1469
00:56:50,351 --> 00:56:51,184
this.
Yeah.

1470
00:56:52,300 --> 00:56:54,300
Like an old lady was scowling.
What?

1471
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:57,370
Yeah.
I had an old lady like that at the store

1472
00:56:57,371 --> 00:56:58,900
the other day.
Older lady.

1473
00:56:59,170 --> 00:57:02,830
Like she was like halfway into my act.
She still had this look on her face.

1474
00:57:02,831 --> 00:57:03,250
Like,
oh,

1475
00:57:03,250 --> 00:57:07,810
I don't know.
I hit it with this one bit and this one

1476
00:57:07,811 --> 00:57:09,490
bid,
she throws her head back and then she's

1477
00:57:09,491 --> 00:57:09,920
Howard.

1478
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:11,010
I'm like,
I got her.

1479
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:12,970
Wow.
I got nice.

1480
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,090
She didn't want to give and that's a
good,

1481
00:57:15,100 --> 00:57:19,360
that's a fun soda to cry when she was
like all of a sudden white best feeling

1482
00:57:19,361 --> 00:57:20,860
gave in.
Maybe it was the booze,

1483
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:23,770
the booze kicked in.
How many without booze?

1484
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:25,000
Boy,
that would be a struggle.

1485
00:57:25,030 --> 00:57:27,370
That would suck.
I mean our whole job is entertaining

1486
00:57:27,371 --> 00:57:29,740
drinkers.
I wonder what it would be like if we had

1487
00:57:29,741 --> 00:57:32,110
liquor free comedy nights.
Have you played?

1488
00:57:32,140 --> 00:57:33,940
You have to have played like those we'd
rooms.

1489
00:57:34,180 --> 00:57:36,640
Yes.
Those are too crazy or insane.

1490
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:38,770
We did the Toronto one,
the underground room.

1491
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:42,550
There was no air for the candles on the
table.

1492
00:57:42,551 --> 00:57:44,650
The candles were running on a promissory
note.

1493
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:48,130
There was no oxygen in the room.
It was all just weed smoke.

1494
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:52,720
I was on stage midway through jokes and
having second thoughts about it.

1495
00:57:52,770 --> 00:57:56,110
Like every linear thought was a tree
branch that was growing where I'm like,

1496
00:57:56,111 --> 00:57:57,550
which one would follow?
Well,

1497
00:57:57,551 --> 00:57:59,200
not only that,
what did I already talk about?

1498
00:57:59,230 --> 00:58:00,063
Yes.
Yeah.

1499
00:58:00,090 --> 00:58:00,760
Am I at,
what?

1500
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:02,620
Am I covered?
All right.

1501
00:58:02,650 --> 00:58:06,100
I have no fucking idea.
Do you guys know what I was doing?

1502
00:58:06,101 --> 00:58:09,040
It was doing it with Tripoli and Tripoli
was sober at the time,

1503
00:58:09,430 --> 00:58:13,300
but we walk in this room and the
secondhand smoke is a fucking real

1504
00:58:13,301 --> 00:58:14,170
thing.
That's what I mean.

1505
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:16,990
I hadn't hit a joint.
You have to wait till after my set.

1506
00:58:16,991 --> 00:58:21,130
I don't like doing comedy high and I
felt I felt high on stage and it's that

1507
00:58:21,131 --> 00:58:23,020
thing where it's like,
well you just got to run with it.

1508
00:58:23,050 --> 00:58:24,730
You can't,
you can't fight the tide.

1509
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,070
Don't swim upstream.
You're not getting any better.

1510
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:30,160
You just got to keep going.
I did.

1511
00:58:30,190 --> 00:58:33,310
There's a show that a guy,
Andy Haynes had called midnight run

1512
00:58:33,311 --> 00:58:37,240
where you'd smoke right before he got on
stage and you just hit this big joint

1513
00:58:37,270 --> 00:58:42,270
and I was doing great and then I had
this huge setup and then my brain just

1514
00:58:44,260 --> 00:58:46,120
the bottom fell out,
everything fell out,

1515
00:58:46,390 --> 00:58:47,710
all ideas,
all thoughts,

1516
00:58:47,711 --> 00:58:49,840
my name and I just went,
it was like,

1517
00:58:49,870 --> 00:58:51,910
and then the girl turns to me,
I've got to go.

1518
00:58:52,060 --> 00:58:55,750
And I walked in the middle of a setup
and then it was a crushed any cause

1519
00:58:55,751 --> 00:58:59,180
people were laughing so hard because I
just pulled the rip cord.

1520
00:58:59,830 --> 00:59:03,310
I literally was like,
I had a parachute that came out my

1521
00:59:03,311 --> 00:59:07,420
backpack that pulled me out of the room.
Sometimes marijuana is your friend and

1522
00:59:07,421 --> 00:59:09,100
sometimes it will fuck up your whole
set.

1523
00:59:09,101 --> 00:59:10,660
But sometimes it'll go,
why?

1524
00:59:10,930 --> 00:59:12,850
Why is that?
And then people go,

1525
00:59:12,851 --> 00:59:13,720
yeah,
why is that?

1526
00:59:13,721 --> 00:59:16,300
And then you're off on this tangent,
but you probably would have never been

1527
00:59:16,301 --> 00:59:18,820
on.
And that tangent might be the best part

1528
00:59:18,821 --> 00:59:19,810
of that set.
Yeah.

1529
00:59:20,050 --> 00:59:22,010
I mean I think about people that were
like,

1530
00:59:22,070 --> 00:59:24,500
uh,
from very regimented backgrounds and

1531
00:59:24,501 --> 00:59:25,850
went into the military,
you know,

1532
00:59:25,851 --> 00:59:27,770
in the 60s and then hit their first
joint and went,

1533
00:59:28,250 --> 00:59:29,520
this is dumb.
Yeah.

1534
00:59:29,750 --> 00:59:31,100
I hate this.
Are they,

1535
00:59:31,130 --> 00:59:34,010
cause that's the thing about,
I found it about marijuana is it

1536
00:59:34,011 --> 00:59:37,520
introduced truths about myself that I
found hard to face.

1537
00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:39,830
Uh,
and they were maneuver my new truth.

1538
00:59:39,831 --> 00:59:43,280
They weren't anything big that I,
that I was afraid of or something.

1539
00:59:43,281 --> 00:59:45,080
You know that like,
I really want to kill someone or

1540
00:59:45,081 --> 00:59:48,390
something stupid.
But it was just little things that we'd

1541
00:59:48,410 --> 00:59:50,940
like bubble up.
And I think that's,

1542
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:53,090
that's the craziest thing about that
plant to me.

1543
00:59:53,450 --> 00:59:55,970
Well,
the idea that it makes you paranoid,

1544
00:59:56,300 --> 00:59:57,140
right?
That's it.

1545
00:59:57,470 --> 00:59:58,810
It's the paranoia,
right?

1546
00:59:58,880 --> 00:59:59,900
Oh,
I don't like pot.

1547
00:59:59,901 --> 01:00:02,990
It makes me paranoid.
I really think it makes you hyper aware

1548
01:00:02,991 --> 01:00:04,850
of all sorts of things you've been
suppressing.

1549
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:06,710
That's it.
Because when I'm feeling good,

1550
01:00:06,740 --> 01:00:09,290
when I'm happy,
like I've been a good person.

1551
01:00:09,291 --> 01:00:12,170
I've been nice to people,
I've done the things I'm supposed to do.

1552
01:00:12,410 --> 01:00:14,150
I can get high and I enjoy the shit out
of it.

1553
01:00:14,390 --> 01:00:16,160
But when I got loose ends,
I'm,

1554
01:00:16,220 --> 01:00:18,500
I got things that are fucking with me,
you know,

1555
01:00:18,501 --> 01:00:21,950
maybe like something that went wrong in
my life or whatever.

1556
01:00:21,950 --> 01:00:23,930
And then I smoked pot and then it just
gets weird.

1557
01:00:24,050 --> 01:00:27,140
Yeah.
And I tend to not,

1558
01:00:27,141 --> 01:00:30,110
I don't smoke anymore and get and think
about myself and get worried about me.

1559
01:00:30,111 --> 01:00:33,110
I think about the world and I think
about way too big of issues.

1560
01:00:33,111 --> 01:00:36,110
And I work,
I think about maybe we're all fucked and

1561
01:00:36,111 --> 01:00:37,640
you know everything.
And do you have children?

1562
01:00:37,700 --> 01:00:39,080
No.
Once you have children,

1563
01:00:39,081 --> 01:00:40,940
then you start thinking about the
future.

1564
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:42,980
Yeah.
Like what is it going to be like for my

1565
01:00:42,981 --> 01:00:45,690
children's children or their children?
Like you're like,

1566
01:00:45,710 --> 01:00:47,660
what,
what kind of toxic world are we going to

1567
01:00:47,661 --> 01:00:48,494
be living in?
Yeah.

1568
01:00:48,770 --> 01:00:51,470
Yeah.
This progress that we're exhibiting

1569
01:00:51,530 --> 01:00:54,230
right now,
if it keeps going in the same direction,

1570
01:00:54,380 --> 01:00:59,180
I think we're living at a level in a
level of anxiety as a human race that

1571
01:00:59,210 --> 01:01:00,950
probably four or five years ago I would
have been like,

1572
01:01:00,980 --> 01:01:03,470
we can't handle that,
but we're somehow handling it,

1573
01:01:03,890 --> 01:01:04,650
you know?

1574
01:01:04,650 --> 01:01:05,780
Well,
we were adaptable.

1575
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:07,080
Yeah.
I,

1576
01:01:07,120 --> 01:01:09,360
I've definitely learned that,
but it's the,

1577
01:01:09,370 --> 01:01:11,030
the,
the amount of times I,

1578
01:01:11,870 --> 01:01:14,990
I'm so happy for comedy.
I'm so thankful that I'm a comedian and

1579
01:01:14,991 --> 01:01:16,400
I'm around comedians.
They can kind of just,

1580
01:01:16,490 --> 01:01:19,820
she just let the air out of me anytime.
What did you do before you did comedy?

1581
01:01:19,910 --> 01:01:21,080
I was,
uh,

1582
01:01:21,290 --> 01:01:21,950
I,
when I was,

1583
01:01:21,950 --> 01:01:24,080
I was an actor as I was when I was a
kid.

1584
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:27,590
And then I went to school for acting and
then I went to Chicago and I got an

1585
01:01:27,591 --> 01:01:29,780
Improv and stand up and that was it
where I was like,

1586
01:01:29,781 --> 01:01:31,670
I'll still do acting.
But like this is,

1587
01:01:31,820 --> 01:01:34,820
this is where my heart is with so much
more fun.

1588
01:01:34,930 --> 01:01:38,240
It's so much more you can do it.
And it's so honest and it's so in the

1589
01:01:38,241 --> 01:01:39,074
moment,
I,

1590
01:01:39,080 --> 01:01:40,610
I,
I've said this a lot,

1591
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:42,290
uh,
on here and there,

1592
01:01:42,291 --> 01:01:44,050
but there is,
you know,

1593
01:01:44,090 --> 01:01:45,500
when you're on stage and you're going
through a bit,

1594
01:01:45,501 --> 01:01:47,600
you've done 50 times and you just drop
it and go,

1595
01:01:47,601 --> 01:01:49,370
you know what,
fucking I had the worst diarrhea

1596
01:01:49,371 --> 01:01:50,420
together today or whatever.

1597
01:01:50,420 --> 01:01:52,560
You know,
like something that you just share it

1598
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:56,180
and the crowd goes,
oh cause a defense attorney wrote this

1599
01:01:56,181 --> 01:01:57,830
book and one line,
and it was,

1600
01:01:58,040 --> 01:01:59,870
the truth just sounds different in
court.

1601
01:02:00,440 --> 01:02:03,380
It just sounds different.
And it's the same thing for a comedian

1602
01:02:03,560 --> 01:02:07,400
when a person just goes,
I don't think my wife loves me and

1603
01:02:07,401 --> 01:02:09,770
you'll get a laugh,
but it's like fuck,

1604
01:02:09,771 --> 01:02:11,450
he really believes that.
And now the crowds like,

1605
01:02:11,480 --> 01:02:11,901
Ooh,
yeah,

1606
01:02:11,901 --> 01:02:12,591
good.
Now,

1607
01:02:12,591 --> 01:02:13,970
this is the meat.
You know,

1608
01:02:13,971 --> 01:02:14,650
you,
you took the,

1609
01:02:14,650 --> 01:02:17,840
you took the cheetos off the table,
now you've put the roasts down now good.

1610
01:02:17,841 --> 01:02:21,780
Now we have something to chew on.
And that's the immediacy of that can't

1611
01:02:21,781 --> 01:02:25,560
really be matched Improv,
maybe life theater shore.

1612
01:02:25,860 --> 01:02:29,820
But standup comedy is the,
is the moment like Buddhism,

1613
01:02:29,821 --> 01:02:32,850
like steep sand,
the moment and in comedy if you're out,

1614
01:02:32,851 --> 01:02:35,010
if you stay out of the moment,
you're no longer in the pole position.

1615
01:02:35,011 --> 01:02:38,850
Your car's going to drive off the off
the off the road because the ultimate

1616
01:02:38,851 --> 01:02:42,480
bullshit detector is a crowd.
And they know far more than they know.

1617
01:02:42,481 --> 01:02:43,260
They know.

1618
01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:45,600
You know,
I've been reading these articles written

1619
01:02:45,601 --> 01:02:49,110
by these angry women about Louis C.
Case comeback and some of them have been

1620
01:02:49,111 --> 01:02:52,830
going to his shows and writing about the
show.

1621
01:02:52,831 --> 01:02:56,160
And one of them that I read today was
from this woman in Pittsburgh.

1622
01:02:56,490 --> 01:02:57,600
What?
I thought it was fascinating.

1623
01:02:57,610 --> 01:03:02,610
She said that he has a,
he doesn't allow people to bring cell

1624
01:03:03,031 --> 01:03:03,751
phones.
You know,

1625
01:03:03,751 --> 01:03:08,240
they have those yonder pouches.
We put you and the woman's her,

1626
01:03:08,241 --> 01:03:13,241
her rationalization of this was,
and she included me and Dave Chappelle

1627
01:03:13,591 --> 01:03:16,620
and this,
that we use those because we know that

1628
01:03:16,621 --> 01:03:19,560
words offend,
but we don't want the consequences,

1629
01:03:20,340 --> 01:03:22,310
which is not what it is at all.
No,

1630
01:03:22,350 --> 01:03:24,470
it's,
you don't want people sharing your,

1631
01:03:24,540 --> 01:03:27,810
if your material online because you're
developing it and you're touring with

1632
01:03:27,811 --> 01:03:30,390
it,
just like we and jokes are a surprise

1633
01:03:30,391 --> 01:03:32,580
musician doesn't want you recording
them,

1634
01:03:32,581 --> 01:03:35,520
just noodling around before they finish
this song.

1635
01:03:35,610 --> 01:03:37,500
Right.
But it musician's song,

1636
01:03:37,501 --> 01:03:40,290
the differences,
you can hear it over and over and over

1637
01:03:40,291 --> 01:03:42,240
again and it doesn't lose any of the
thing.

1638
01:03:42,241 --> 01:03:44,100
You want to deploy it more,
more to the point.

1639
01:03:44,101 --> 01:03:46,470
But if you have a bit about diapers,
right.

1640
01:03:46,471 --> 01:03:50,040
And there's just like a very specific
punchline about a diaper and then they

1641
01:03:50,041 --> 01:03:52,260
already know it.
They know that punchline and you're

1642
01:03:52,261 --> 01:03:55,470
working out how to get to that punchline
and how to set up the bit.

1643
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:58,440
But someone leaked the audio already
like that.

1644
01:03:58,530 --> 01:04:02,190
Like Louise touring right now with that
leaked set.

1645
01:04:02,520 --> 01:04:03,930
Yeah.
Which is weird,

1646
01:04:04,380 --> 01:04:05,213
right?
Like what?

1647
01:04:05,220 --> 01:04:08,640
All that stuff about the Parkland kids.
And I don't know if he's still doing

1648
01:04:08,641 --> 01:04:10,620
those bits,
but he was doing some of those bits.

1649
01:04:10,730 --> 01:04:13,560
Yeah.
He has a bit about losing all the money

1650
01:04:13,561 --> 01:04:14,394
and about,
uh,

1651
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:16,440
how he bought a gold watch.
Like those bits,

1652
01:04:16,441 --> 01:04:18,930
like this woman referenced those bits in
the article,

1653
01:04:19,050 --> 01:04:22,290
which means that she went to the show
and he's doing the material from the

1654
01:04:22,291 --> 01:04:25,110
leak,
which he kind of has to do because he's

1655
01:04:25,130 --> 01:04:28,680
only if you wrote an hour over the last
10 months,

1656
01:04:28,700 --> 01:04:30,390
right.
He's been hiatus.

1657
01:04:30,840 --> 01:04:31,950
What,
what does he do?

1658
01:04:32,040 --> 01:04:35,040
Like what you can't,
he's touring shows you're going to tour

1659
01:04:35,041 --> 01:04:37,280
with a whole new hour.
Get the fuck Outta here.

1660
01:04:37,330 --> 01:04:38,120
Yeah.
I mean,

1661
01:04:38,120 --> 01:04:38,490
yeah,

1662
01:04:38,490 --> 01:04:40,260
I feel like,
I feel like he's,

1663
01:04:40,290 --> 01:04:43,830
he's quite obviously a special case
because of his behavior,

1664
01:04:44,790 --> 01:04:46,350
but it's,
it's almost like,

1665
01:04:46,530 --> 01:04:49,020
I will say that aside,
you know,

1666
01:04:49,021 --> 01:04:50,340
like,
uh,

1667
01:04:50,430 --> 01:04:53,550
I have my problems with Louie and what
he's done and everything.

1668
01:04:53,551 --> 01:04:56,550
But overall,
I'm on the side of free speech.

1669
01:04:56,551 --> 01:05:01,551
And in terms of being comedians,
we can't allow you to come in and film

1670
01:05:01,651 --> 01:05:04,350
our shit or recorded no matter who it
is.

1671
01:05:04,530 --> 01:05:06,120
Because it's,
it's the,

1672
01:05:06,570 --> 01:05:09,510
the larger thing is like everyone,
one thing with comedy is everyone,

1673
01:05:09,570 --> 01:05:11,190
everyone,
everyone thinks they're an expert.

1674
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:13,050
There's no other art form or someone's
like,

1675
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:15,950
I know what the best shit is,
or I got a friend funnier than you.

1676
01:05:16,100 --> 01:05:17,920
Right.
But in all fairness,

1677
01:05:17,921 --> 01:05:19,900
if I go to see a movie,
I'm not a movie maker,

1678
01:05:19,901 --> 01:05:21,940
but if I go to see a movie and I think
it sucks,

1679
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:22,960
I should be able to say,
oh,

1680
01:05:22,961 --> 01:05:23,794
that movie blue.

1681
01:05:23,890 --> 01:05:26,380
True.
But you're not allowed to go on set and

1682
01:05:26,381 --> 01:05:30,910
filming yourself while they're filming
while you're also not allowed to bootleg

1683
01:05:30,911 --> 01:05:32,920
it and then put it online.
You don't go to jail.

1684
01:05:32,940 --> 01:05:33,790
Yeah.
Yeah.

1685
01:05:33,940 --> 01:05:35,340
And it really will.
Yeah.

1686
01:05:35,410 --> 01:05:36,300
And people,
uh,

1687
01:05:36,310 --> 01:05:37,960
that,
that record our stuff like,

1688
01:05:38,130 --> 01:05:40,330
uh,
Stan hopeless was tweeting about that.

1689
01:05:40,510 --> 01:05:42,430
Like,
how is this legal right after a louis

1690
01:05:42,460 --> 01:05:42,970
thing.
Yeah.

1691
01:05:42,970 --> 01:05:43,900
And,
and uh,

1692
01:05:43,901 --> 01:05:46,090
you know,
Chappelle has that thing that like the

1693
01:05:46,091 --> 01:05:48,340
comedy works has where you come in with
your cell phone,

1694
01:05:48,341 --> 01:05:49,660
they put it in a locked pouch.
Yeah.

1695
01:05:49,770 --> 01:05:51,430
You get the Combo,
you get it when you leave.

1696
01:05:51,880 --> 01:05:56,860
I was doing that before I did my netflix
special bar was only doing it to really,

1697
01:05:56,861 --> 01:06:01,270
because I was tightening up my set and I
didn't want any of it getting leaked

1698
01:06:01,271 --> 01:06:04,210
right before the Netflix special.
But once I filmed it,

1699
01:06:04,211 --> 01:06:05,920
then I stopped doing it because it was
like,

1700
01:06:05,921 --> 01:06:09,430
it's too hard,
too complicated and it's just like the

1701
01:06:09,431 --> 01:06:10,960
Internet is going to be the internet.

1702
01:06:11,360 --> 01:06:14,890
It's just,
it did make the show better though.

1703
01:06:14,920 --> 01:06:16,090
You know,
where it did make it better.

1704
01:06:16,120 --> 01:06:18,250
Miami,
I'll realize in Miami,

1705
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:23,400
people are there such chimps that they
just kept getting up and walking out and

1706
01:06:23,651 --> 01:06:27,310
to check their phone so they'd get up,
they'd go out to get their phone,

1707
01:06:27,311 --> 01:06:30,190
they come back and so they were all just
like popping up and down.

1708
01:06:30,610 --> 01:06:32,800
Everybody's just trying to fuck and do
coke in Miami.

1709
01:06:34,450 --> 01:06:37,390
Miami will always be more insane than
any given American city.

1710
01:06:37,391 --> 01:06:41,360
It's just on another level.
It's forever young forever.

1711
01:06:41,390 --> 01:06:43,960
It's forever 21 yeah.
It really is like that.

1712
01:06:43,961 --> 01:06:47,910
Like the name of that city.
It is a cocaine city.

1713
01:06:47,911 --> 01:06:50,950
I mean it's created by cocaine.
There's more banks per capita in Miami

1714
01:06:50,951 --> 01:06:53,320
who I know in anywhere else because it
will cocaine laundering.

1715
01:06:53,321 --> 01:06:53,891
Yeah.
And,

1716
01:06:53,891 --> 01:06:55,990
and you,
you go there and they're like,

1717
01:06:56,250 --> 01:06:56,801
uh,
oh,

1718
01:06:56,801 --> 01:06:58,390
you're gonna,
you're gonna go out tonight and you're

1719
01:06:58,391 --> 01:06:59,140
like,
I'm out.

1720
01:06:59,140 --> 01:06:59,621
And they're like,
no,

1721
01:06:59,621 --> 01:07:02,320
I mean it's 1:00 AM we're not going out
until five.

1722
01:07:02,380 --> 01:07:04,720
Yeah.
What are you five extra years old?

1723
01:07:04,721 --> 01:07:06,010
And you're like,
what the fuck?

1724
01:07:06,011 --> 01:07:07,390
Fuck,
I don't do that.

1725
01:07:07,450 --> 01:07:09,040
You guys are crazy.
I have a wife.

1726
01:07:09,100 --> 01:07:10,200
They're all high.
Yeah,

1727
01:07:10,390 --> 01:07:12,520
exactly.
Fucked up on coke and pills.

1728
01:07:12,550 --> 01:07:13,870
Yeah.
Running around rapid.

1729
01:07:14,680 --> 01:07:17,860
You mentioned Chappelle and we were
talking about bordain before and I will

1730
01:07:17,861 --> 01:07:21,370
not say what the joke is,
but that guy is such an alchemist.

1731
01:07:21,460 --> 01:07:24,520
Like he can just make gold out of lead
in terms of,

1732
01:07:24,550 --> 01:07:26,790
in terms of material.
He had a board,

1733
01:07:26,791 --> 01:07:31,791
Dane joke that made me double over
laughing about the suicide and wasn't

1734
01:07:32,140 --> 01:07:37,140
talking about bordain per se.
But about his own family member.

1735
01:07:38,070 --> 01:07:38,741
Uh,
I like,

1736
01:07:38,741 --> 01:07:40,020
I don't want to blow the joke,
but it was,

1737
01:07:40,140 --> 01:07:43,450
it was that thing where a apologies to
people who are listening to this.

1738
01:07:43,450 --> 01:07:45,640
I know you want me to say what it is,
but I,

1739
01:07:45,641 --> 01:07:46,361
you know,
he's probably gonna do,

1740
01:07:46,361 --> 01:07:47,440
doing a special show.
I didn't do that,

1741
01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:51,040
but it was,
it's testament to how with comedy

1742
01:07:51,041 --> 01:07:52,650
there's always,
there's always a,

1743
01:07:52,750 --> 01:07:54,880
a mission impossible.
There's always a topic,

1744
01:07:54,881 --> 01:07:57,250
like,
you cannot make fun of this.

1745
01:07:57,610 --> 01:08:01,510
And someone found a way and it wasn't
disrespectful and I was just like,

1746
01:08:01,511 --> 01:08:02,770
God dammit.
You know,

1747
01:08:03,310 --> 01:08:05,050
he'll just say these setups that you're
like,

1748
01:08:05,110 --> 01:08:07,030
Ooh,
where are you going with this one?

1749
01:08:07,420 --> 01:08:09,790
Jesus Christ.
The idea that you can't make fun of

1750
01:08:09,791 --> 01:08:11,980
something is crazy.
Like just you just,

1751
01:08:12,100 --> 01:08:14,800
you might do it wrong,
but someone can do it,

1752
01:08:14,801 --> 01:08:15,590
right?
Yeah.

1753
01:08:15,590 --> 01:08:16,100
Yeah.
I mean,

1754
01:08:16,100 --> 01:08:18,710
it might,
might not be your style,

1755
01:08:19,160 --> 01:08:20,420
but someone can do it.
Like,

1756
01:08:20,830 --> 01:08:21,663
you know,
everybody's got,

1757
01:08:21,980 --> 01:08:25,040
there's so many weird styles.
One of the beautiful things about comedy

1758
01:08:25,041 --> 01:08:27,370
is the fact that styles are so personal.
Yes.

1759
01:08:27,420 --> 01:08:29,330
You know,
like David Tail might be able to do a

1760
01:08:29,331 --> 01:08:30,380
bit that,
you know,

1761
01:08:30,381 --> 01:08:33,290
Sebastian could not do.
It's just not in his wheelhouse.

1762
01:08:33,320 --> 01:08:36,110
David tell is prob probably the funniest
man on earth.

1763
01:08:36,140 --> 01:08:37,810
He's one of them for sure.
Dude just,

1764
01:08:38,030 --> 01:08:41,540
just kills me every time he's another
magician.

1765
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:43,970
He just pulls shit out of the air and
he's so prolific.

1766
01:08:44,060 --> 01:08:45,650
Yeah.
He's just always writing,

1767
01:08:45,740 --> 01:08:47,530
always,
always tone tuning things.

1768
01:08:47,531 --> 01:08:48,920
He'll call you up and go,
hey,

1769
01:08:48,921 --> 01:08:50,090
you ever heard something like this
before?

1770
01:08:50,480 --> 01:08:51,140
Because it's like,
it just,

1771
01:08:51,140 --> 01:08:53,510
it'll come to oils,
wants to make sure.

1772
01:08:53,650 --> 01:08:54,650
Yeah,
yeah,

1773
01:08:55,220 --> 01:08:56,580
yeah,
he did.

1774
01:08:56,600 --> 01:09:00,980
Comedy is so beautiful in that it's
really is an art form that you cannot

1775
01:09:00,981 --> 01:09:01,850
learn anywhere.

1776
01:09:01,970 --> 01:09:03,610
Like you have to learn it yourself.
Yeah.

1777
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:05,870
It's not like you can learn how to play
the clarinet.

1778
01:09:05,900 --> 01:09:09,230
You go and take classes and practice
music.

1779
01:09:09,710 --> 01:09:13,010
I've ever created anything.
And you could play beautiful clarinet

1780
01:09:13,011 --> 01:09:13,844
music.
Yeah.

1781
01:09:14,060 --> 01:09:17,390
I mean you don't have to ever have
invented a single song and you could

1782
01:09:17,391 --> 01:09:20,240
just go out there and make a living
playing the clarinet.

1783
01:09:20,260 --> 01:09:22,760
Well and you don't learn to play a
clarinet in front of an audience.

1784
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:24,940
You don't bring it to the clarinet open
like,

1785
01:09:26,010 --> 01:09:28,790
Oh fuck you.
You have to learn in front of people.

1786
01:09:28,820 --> 01:09:29,820
[inaudible] yeah,
you,

1787
01:09:29,821 --> 01:09:32,390
you're not going to get up there and
play flight of the Bumblebee right away.

1788
01:09:32,480 --> 01:09:35,480
Is there anything else we have to learn
in front of people like that?

1789
01:09:36,530 --> 01:09:37,700
I mean,
even basketball,

1790
01:09:37,701 --> 01:09:40,700
you practice in the gym.
There might be a couple of friends

1791
01:09:40,701 --> 01:09:41,650
hanging out.
Yeah,

1792
01:09:41,670 --> 01:09:42,680
there's,
yeah,

1793
01:09:42,681 --> 01:09:44,950
it is the only,
only our from,

1794
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:47,000
I can think of that you get,
you can only get better in front of a

1795
01:09:47,001 --> 01:09:47,450
crowd.

1796
01:09:47,450 --> 01:09:49,250
It's fucking crazy.
It's really crazy.

1797
01:09:49,270 --> 01:09:52,820
And there's no classes.
All classes that you take are useless.

1798
01:09:52,821 --> 01:09:54,740
Really.
They're all taught by fools.

1799
01:09:54,850 --> 01:09:56,930
Yeah.
They're almost sorry folks teaching

1800
01:09:56,960 --> 01:09:59,460
comedy class.
I've had friends who have,

1801
01:09:59,510 --> 01:10:00,510
who have been,
uh,

1802
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:03,410
John Roy,
right stuff online that I think is

1803
01:10:03,411 --> 01:10:06,710
really illuminating to teach you what
the business is really like and,

1804
01:10:06,711 --> 01:10:09,260
and,
and what the best comedy is from a

1805
01:10:09,261 --> 01:10:10,970
comedian's perspective.
But he's not,

1806
01:10:11,150 --> 01:10:13,850
he just puts them up there for free.
He's not sitting in a room,

1807
01:10:14,030 --> 01:10:17,000
someone can give you a coat,
like a good comic and coach you.

1808
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:17,810
Yeah.
Can say,

1809
01:10:17,810 --> 01:10:18,321
hey man,
you know,

1810
01:10:18,321 --> 01:10:19,910
that bit if you just came at it this
way,

1811
01:10:19,940 --> 01:10:23,450
maybe that would be an easier way.
Like Neal Brennan is that genius that

1812
01:10:23,451 --> 01:10:25,460
way.
And I did that for,

1813
01:10:25,461 --> 01:10:28,400
um,
for a show where a guy who was,

1814
01:10:28,460 --> 01:10:30,710
he was more of like,
he's entertaining,

1815
01:10:30,711 --> 01:10:32,800
but he's his,
his delivery and stuff was kind of like

1816
01:10:32,801 --> 01:10:33,410
a Ted talk.

1817
01:10:33,410 --> 01:10:34,370
And he was doing like,
uh,

1818
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:36,830
he's going to do a show.
You did a pilot where it was just him

1819
01:10:36,831 --> 01:10:38,510
kind of talking about the news and
stuff,

1820
01:10:38,630 --> 01:10:42,510
and basically I,
they brought me in to kind of just

1821
01:10:42,530 --> 01:10:44,480
loosen them up to make it,
you know,

1822
01:10:44,481 --> 01:10:47,480
like the best comedians.
It gets like the funniest person at a

1823
01:10:47,481 --> 01:10:48,960
party or a,
Ha,

1824
01:10:49,170 --> 01:10:51,290
you're,
you're as natural in front of your

1825
01:10:51,291 --> 01:10:54,020
friends after a couple of beers as you
are on stage.

1826
01:10:54,050 --> 01:10:54,590
Right.
You know,

1827
01:10:54,590 --> 01:10:56,480
so I just had to fuck,
and it was just,

1828
01:10:56,710 --> 01:10:59,120
it was like,
like an tightening muscles on this guy

1829
01:10:59,160 --> 01:11:00,050
where I'm just like,
nope,

1830
01:11:00,170 --> 01:11:00,741
nope.
You're,

1831
01:11:00,741 --> 01:11:02,350
you're,
you're leaning into the funding,

1832
01:11:02,370 --> 01:11:04,070
you're trying to,
you're getting loud and you think that's

1833
01:11:04,071 --> 01:11:04,341
fine.
No,

1834
01:11:04,341 --> 01:11:06,770
no.
Just say it was fun.

1835
01:11:06,830 --> 01:11:08,090
That was fun.
Just coaching someone.

1836
01:11:08,150 --> 01:11:10,510
It's hard for people to see how other
people are seeing them.

1837
01:11:10,610 --> 01:11:12,050
Yeah.
Is sometimes,

1838
01:11:12,051 --> 01:11:14,160
that's one of the reasons why people
like to avoid

1839
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:16,320
recordings or films.
They don't want to watch themselves

1840
01:11:17,060 --> 01:11:20,010
cause you watch yourself and you like
Yuck cost the worst.

1841
01:11:20,190 --> 01:11:23,130
You Watch an edit of your special I
have,

1842
01:11:23,140 --> 01:11:25,950
cause you already know the jokes.
They're not funny to you.

1843
01:11:25,951 --> 01:11:29,550
They don't hit you.
I have a special coming out February 5th

1844
01:11:29,580 --> 01:11:31,950
called find it a lot.
Finally live in Portland.

1845
01:11:32,220 --> 01:11:33,790
And what's it coming out on?
Ah,

1846
01:11:33,810 --> 01:11:35,540
it's coming.
It's going to be like Gaffigan's like

1847
01:11:35,580 --> 01:11:37,980
everywhere.
So Amazon prime,

1848
01:11:38,970 --> 01:11:40,890
Google play and Itunes,
all that jazz.

1849
01:11:41,620 --> 01:11:44,140
And it seems to be the trend.
Yeah.

1850
01:11:44,160 --> 01:11:47,520
I mean people who are doing that,
I was just tired of waiting where I had,

1851
01:11:47,580 --> 01:11:50,250
I had netflix and comedy central.
They both have good relationships with

1852
01:11:50,251 --> 01:11:52,140
them but they're like,
our is full for this year.

1853
01:11:52,141 --> 01:11:53,640
We'll try for next year.
And I'm like,

1854
01:11:54,030 --> 01:11:54,540
man,
it's,

1855
01:11:54,540 --> 01:11:57,030
it's the first part of the year now you
can't,

1856
01:11:57,150 --> 01:11:58,640
I'm just going to do it and,
and,

1857
01:11:58,641 --> 01:12:00,450
and Hinchcliffe is going to do the same
thing.

1858
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:01,433
Smart.
Yeah.

1859
01:12:01,460 --> 01:12:02,161
Yeah,
yeah.

1860
01:12:02,161 --> 01:12:04,440
It's an callen to count.
Just did the same thing.

1861
01:12:04,500 --> 01:12:05,880
It's like you get to a point where
you're like,

1862
01:12:05,881 --> 01:12:06,900
look,
I got to go.

1863
01:12:06,901 --> 01:12:08,160
I get it.
That you guys have.

1864
01:12:08,260 --> 01:12:10,810
Yeah.
Five Hannah Gadsby specials on the best

1865
01:12:10,811 --> 01:12:14,260
burner ready to rock and roll about to
wake people up.

1866
01:12:14,261 --> 01:12:17,490
But I gotta make my thing.
But to the point,

1867
01:12:17,730 --> 01:12:19,830
besides my obvious sneaking in a plug
there,

1868
01:12:19,831 --> 01:12:23,280
I like watching the cut of it with a,
with an editor.

1869
01:12:23,281 --> 01:12:23,920
I'm,
oh,

1870
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:25,080
death,
death,

1871
01:12:25,110 --> 01:12:25,950
death.
People are like,

1872
01:12:25,951 --> 01:12:28,380
what's your favorite joke on it?
None of them hate tomorrow.

1873
01:12:28,460 --> 01:12:30,660
He'd all those jokes,
but that's cause you're good.

1874
01:12:31,270 --> 01:12:33,240
Any banks who suck,
they love everything.

1875
01:12:33,241 --> 01:12:34,074
They do.

1876
01:12:36,220 --> 01:12:39,210
This late two minutes,
I'm going to shit on Bobby Lee real

1877
01:12:39,211 --> 01:12:40,840
quick.
Even though we've only loved bobby.

1878
01:12:41,290 --> 01:12:42,240
I love him,
but,

1879
01:12:42,241 --> 01:12:45,960
and it's not even shitting on him.
I admired him when we were on,

1880
01:12:45,990 --> 01:12:49,110
when we were on mad TV together.
Eric Price and I were both on there.

1881
01:12:49,620 --> 01:12:51,600
We got hired the last season and then
they canceled it.

1882
01:12:52,050 --> 01:12:53,910
Make of that what you will.
But uh,

1883
01:12:54,720 --> 01:12:56,940
uh,
when we worked with bobby when he didn't

1884
01:12:56,941 --> 01:12:58,770
have his dick and balls out eating a
salad,

1885
01:12:58,920 --> 01:13:02,320
he would watch playback and we'll just
watch himself and be like,

1886
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:07,170
to the point where Keegan Michael Key,
me and Eric would just point,

1887
01:13:07,200 --> 01:13:08,400
pointed him and go like,
she,

1888
01:13:08,410 --> 01:13:10,260
me,
I'm me.

1889
01:13:11,640 --> 01:13:14,910
He would literally laugh at his own shit
and I admired that about him.

1890
01:13:14,911 --> 01:13:16,080
I'm just like,
I could never,

1891
01:13:16,170 --> 01:13:18,480
it's a mental delusion.
He's got something wrong with his brain.

1892
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:19,680
He,
uh,

1893
01:13:19,680 --> 01:13:21,960
he needs to put on a special,
I've been telling him forever,

1894
01:13:22,290 --> 01:13:24,100
dude,
you are one of the best standup

1895
01:13:24,140 --> 01:13:26,760
comedians alive and you don't have a
special.

1896
01:13:26,820 --> 01:13:28,370
And he,
he still goes to clubs.

1897
01:13:28,371 --> 01:13:29,850
There's like,
can I just do 20 minutes?

1898
01:13:29,880 --> 01:13:31,260
No one was like,
fuck no.

1899
01:13:31,620 --> 01:13:33,560
What we're paying you.
You Doing Howard?

1900
01:13:33,720 --> 01:13:35,840
Yeah.
He asked if he could do 20 minutes to

1901
01:13:36,190 --> 01:13:37,440
over an hour,
but he's all,

1902
01:13:37,710 --> 01:13:39,540
he's just so down on himself.
He's like,

1903
01:13:39,541 --> 01:13:42,450
I don't think I got it.
Can I just do like 20 can you let this

1904
01:13:42,451 --> 01:13:46,640
guy do 45 really says that when he goes
to a club and last were there to see

1905
01:13:46,680 --> 01:13:47,790
last I checked.
Yeah.

1906
01:13:47,940 --> 01:13:51,070
Cause he's just so down on himself and
he just get up and just crush you.

1907
01:13:51,071 --> 01:13:52,830
So funny.
I talked to him about it.

1908
01:13:52,831 --> 01:13:53,920
I was like,
why aren't you doing something?

1909
01:13:53,940 --> 01:13:54,840
I,
I'm going to,

1910
01:13:54,841 --> 01:13:55,591
I'm going to,
I'm like,

1911
01:13:55,591 --> 01:13:57,750
you're not going to know.
You've been telling me you're going to

1912
01:13:57,751 --> 01:14:00,990
for years.
I've known bobby leaf for 20 plus years.

1913
01:14:01,350 --> 01:14:04,050
He's never put out a comedy special.
That's insane.

1914
01:14:04,240 --> 01:14:05,910
Yeah.
Bobby Lee almost got me killed at a

1915
01:14:05,911 --> 01:14:09,600
strip club in San Diego.
First Time I met him.

1916
01:14:09,660 --> 01:14:12,100
I already believe it be continue.
We were in our twenties

1917
01:14:12,520 --> 01:14:15,550
and uh,
and uh,

1918
01:14:15,610 --> 01:14:17,920
uh,
I met Bobby Lee down there at the La

1919
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:20,440
Jolla comedy store and then we went out
after the show,

1920
01:14:20,441 --> 01:14:23,050
this is probably like 90 [inaudible],
late 90 [inaudible] somewhere.

1921
01:14:23,470 --> 01:14:27,400
And we went out afterwards,
went out to the Strip club and there was

1922
01:14:27,401 --> 01:14:31,060
this Mexican gentleman with a tattoo on
his face in the 90s,

1923
01:14:31,090 --> 01:14:33,640
which is rare.
And he had long,

1924
01:14:33,730 --> 01:14:35,830
straight black hair.
Wow.

1925
01:14:35,890 --> 01:14:38,050
And he had a look in his eyes like he's
killed people.

1926
01:14:38,940 --> 01:14:40,840
I'm a good,
I'm a,

1927
01:14:40,841 --> 01:14:43,570
I'm a good at sniffing out danger.
I'm like,

1928
01:14:43,571 --> 01:14:45,460
that's real danger.
And Bobby was hitting on,

1929
01:14:45,461 --> 01:14:47,650
his girl was trying to get a lap dance
from his girlfriend.

1930
01:14:47,730 --> 01:14:49,930
I mean,
in Bobby's defense,

1931
01:14:49,931 --> 01:14:52,090
it's at a strip club.
But this girl was apparently his

1932
01:14:52,091 --> 01:14:54,860
girlfriend at a strip club and Bob and
uh,

1933
01:14:54,940 --> 01:14:59,350
the guy stood up and he stood up and he
said something to bobby and bobby comes

1934
01:14:59,351 --> 01:15:00,370
out and he's like,
fuck that guy.

1935
01:15:00,370 --> 01:15:01,600
And I looked at the guy,
looked at Bobby,

1936
01:15:01,610 --> 01:15:03,760
I'm getting out of here right now.
And he's like,

1937
01:15:03,790 --> 01:15:05,800
either I go,
either come with me or you're going to

1938
01:15:05,801 --> 01:15:06,611
walk home.
I'm like,

1939
01:15:06,611 --> 01:15:08,530
fuck you.
I'm not getting killed for,

1940
01:15:08,531 --> 01:15:11,620
you know,
we all ran out into the car and I had a

1941
01:15:11,621 --> 01:15:15,400
Toyota super at the time and I got in my
car and bobby was like,

1942
01:15:15,401 --> 01:15:16,480
that guy ain't gonna do shit.
I'm like,

1943
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:19,420
cat in the fucking car.
I'm like,

1944
01:15:19,421 --> 01:15:20,980
dude,
you don't understand danger.

1945
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,340
You're going to get everyone killed.
It's guys like you,

1946
01:15:24,020 --> 01:15:26,170
Bobby Lee's one of those guys that has
no spidey sense.

1947
01:15:26,230 --> 01:15:27,010
None,
none,

1948
01:15:27,010 --> 01:15:29,890
zero.
You know I have very strong where it's

1949
01:15:29,891 --> 01:15:30,670
tangling,
where I'm like,

1950
01:15:30,670 --> 01:15:31,690
oh,
I'm about to get jumped.

1951
01:15:32,170 --> 01:15:34,530
I needed just abandoned my pride and run
down the streets.

1952
01:15:34,680 --> 01:15:36,730
It was a was a real one.
I was like,

1953
01:15:36,731 --> 01:15:38,540
oh,
this guy's like a gang banger like this.

1954
01:15:39,070 --> 01:15:42,580
He had tattooed tears.
He was legitimately scary looking.

1955
01:15:43,180 --> 01:15:45,880
Even if he was bluffing.
W what is it?

1956
01:15:45,881 --> 01:15:47,710
This is a video,
like what would happen in this big guy

1957
01:15:47,711 --> 01:15:48,544
right here.
He just,

1958
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:52,240
he gets pissed off and he basically
knocked everyone out here in the bar and

1959
01:15:52,241 --> 01:15:53,770
like nothing.
Nobody can do anything about it.

1960
01:15:53,890 --> 01:15:55,720
Oh God.
You just start one guy.

1961
01:15:55,721 --> 01:15:56,321
One guy's like,
hey,

1962
01:15:56,321 --> 01:15:57,870
you need to stop this guy.
Alex,

1963
01:15:57,940 --> 01:16:00,180
that guy out.
He starts beating up a guy over here.

1964
01:16:00,260 --> 01:16:01,840
He's just beating people up for no
reason.

1965
01:16:01,870 --> 01:16:03,130
Yeah.
Someone must have pissed him off.

1966
01:16:03,131 --> 01:16:04,720
He was dancing at the beginning of the
video.

1967
01:16:05,080 --> 01:16:06,640
He's like,
he's not doing anything now.

1968
01:16:07,150 --> 01:16:10,180
Fight.
Just telegraphing every punch.

1969
01:16:10,220 --> 01:16:12,550
I'm not even a fighter,
but he's letting him punch him.

1970
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:14,050
He's just because they're all drunk as
shit to,

1971
01:16:14,110 --> 01:16:15,790
they're bumping into him.
Oh Man.

1972
01:16:15,850 --> 01:16:18,340
Oh,
he's guiding nudge in the morning or

1973
01:16:18,341 --> 01:16:19,540
something like that.
He's a Dick.

1974
01:16:19,541 --> 01:16:20,374
Yeah,
that's,

1975
01:16:20,380 --> 01:16:21,910
that's what could have happened in that
situation.

1976
01:16:24,130 --> 01:16:26,590
You have to send this to me because that
looks like my friend Vince Averil,

1977
01:16:26,980 --> 01:16:30,940
who's a comedian from the Midwest.
He's got that same kind of balding,

1978
01:16:31,540 --> 01:16:33,990
same size.
He's like punching little kits.

1979
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:34,600
Yeah.
Look,

1980
01:16:34,600 --> 01:16:38,380
a giant punching little kids.
One of my favorite videos of a bar is a

1981
01:16:38,381 --> 01:16:42,400
girl and a guy and the guy had gotten
this girl's face and she grabs his,

1982
01:16:42,430 --> 01:16:44,740
his collar and headbutts some
unconscious.

1983
01:16:45,160 --> 01:16:46,100
She grabs and goes,
wow.

1984
01:16:46,630 --> 01:16:48,070
Wow.
Drops.

1985
01:16:48,071 --> 01:16:50,860
It's fucking hilarious.
Like that bitch must've grown up in a

1986
01:16:50,861 --> 01:16:53,140
hard family.
This too.

1987
01:16:53,470 --> 01:16:57,040
Cause this guy is way bigger than her
and it was a dangerous thing to try and

1988
01:16:57,041 --> 01:17:01,780
she just grabs his collar and fuck it
slams her forehead right into his nose.

1989
01:17:01,810 --> 01:17:03,670
I think you can,
you can get away with that if you're a

1990
01:17:03,671 --> 01:17:04,810
lady.
You know what I mean?

1991
01:17:04,811 --> 01:17:07,930
Cause it's cause it's guy,
well not that it's excused but don't do

1992
01:17:07,931 --> 01:17:09,590
it.
But like you're giving bad advice.

1993
01:17:09,620 --> 01:17:12,700
I'm not saying do it.
I'm saying shit,

1994
01:17:12,701 --> 01:17:13,521
this is it.
Yeah,

1995
01:17:13,521 --> 01:17:14,354
watch this.

1996
01:17:16,500 --> 01:17:18,980
They get closer to us.
Look at this back home.

1997
01:17:19,690 --> 01:17:22,010
Kod,
go to sleep bitch.

1998
01:17:22,090 --> 01:17:24,500
Holy Shit.
I look at her just strolling away that

1999
01:17:24,501 --> 01:17:26,510
Carl's done that before and that guy's
like,

2000
01:17:26,570 --> 01:17:28,100
Sheila,
you killed again.

2001
01:17:28,610 --> 01:17:30,380
Yeah.
Whatever gets you help,

2002
01:17:30,410 --> 01:17:32,630
whatever.
Who's going to resume you don't.

2003
01:17:32,631 --> 01:17:34,550
You don't tell he's moving.
He's like,

2004
01:17:34,551 --> 01:17:38,000
we didn't give you a bionic limbs to let
you do this.

2005
01:17:38,500 --> 01:17:41,450
There's just going to play the head
plate stall and when she was six,

2006
01:17:43,250 --> 01:17:45,560
yeah,
saying like put your hands on your

2007
01:17:45,561 --> 01:17:46,790
chest.
That guy had to be like,

2008
01:17:46,850 --> 01:17:49,690
what are you going to really,
he didn't see it coming Tux.

2009
01:17:49,700 --> 01:17:54,280
You never let people touch know,
even if it's a girl girl grabbing like

2010
01:17:54,740 --> 01:17:56,480
very careful.
That's a red flag.

2011
01:17:56,481 --> 01:17:59,060
If someone does that you you feel
tension.

2012
01:17:59,090 --> 01:18:01,130
Yes.
Feel like they're about to do something.

2013
01:18:02,150 --> 01:18:05,420
If you're a dumb dude and you think
you're invulnerable and then wake up

2014
01:18:05,421 --> 01:18:08,210
with a shattered nose,
get headbutted into oblivion.

2015
01:18:08,510 --> 01:18:11,300
That was insane.
The real scary thing is falling out.

2016
01:18:11,540 --> 01:18:12,151
Did the,
the,

2017
01:18:12,151 --> 01:18:15,500
the thing about getting hit is that you
fall in your head bounces.

2018
01:18:15,501 --> 01:18:17,170
Aha.
That's the most dangerous thing.

2019
01:18:17,530 --> 01:18:20,360
Yeah.
I mean I'm so tall I would probably,

2020
01:18:20,420 --> 01:18:22,110
I would have permanent brain damage.
Right.

2021
01:18:22,130 --> 01:18:23,300
All the falling.
Yeah.

2022
01:18:23,380 --> 01:18:25,370
Cause you kind of just,
you're just a sack.

2023
01:18:25,850 --> 01:18:28,700
The sack of Jelly.
Maybe that's why bobby so cocky because

2024
01:18:28,701 --> 01:18:30,380
he's not falling very far.
That's it.

2025
01:18:30,680 --> 01:18:33,890
He's just woken up on the ground rules
like tucks and roles.

2026
01:18:34,100 --> 01:18:36,340
He's like,
I was talking to that guy and I must've

2027
01:18:36,350 --> 01:18:39,530
bumped my head on something cause I woke
up in the alleyway.

2028
01:18:39,830 --> 01:18:41,150
But I'm fine.
I'm fine.

2029
01:18:41,310 --> 01:18:42,143
Yeah.
Yeah.

2030
01:18:43,070 --> 01:18:44,810
Have you ever done his podcast?
No.

2031
01:18:45,500 --> 01:18:47,150
I gotta reach out.
He's a good dude.

2032
01:18:47,180 --> 01:18:48,490
I love,
I love hanging out with a hobby.

2033
01:18:48,500 --> 01:18:50,240
Really does do a comedy special this
year.

2034
01:18:50,240 --> 01:18:51,770
I really do.
Cause he's so funny.

2035
01:18:52,240 --> 01:18:53,073
I mean,
he,

2036
01:18:53,280 --> 01:18:54,650
he's a no brainer for Netflix.
Yeah,

2037
01:18:54,830 --> 01:18:55,730
no brainer.
Right.

2038
01:18:56,210 --> 01:18:57,560
Diversity.
How should we go?

2039
01:18:57,820 --> 01:18:59,090
Yeah.
And he's a nut.

2040
01:18:59,180 --> 01:19:00,670
He has great stories.
Yeah.

2041
01:19:01,140 --> 01:19:02,300
Yeah,
yeah.

2042
01:19:02,660 --> 01:19:04,510
He told me a story once about a,
he,

2043
01:19:04,660 --> 01:19:06,440
he's,
he's at mad TV.

2044
01:19:06,441 --> 01:19:10,970
They had a table read and uh,
he hadn't slept in a couple of days.

2045
01:19:11,150 --> 01:19:14,060
He'd just gotten back from Mexico.
He had a giant bowie knife,

2046
01:19:14,300 --> 01:19:18,080
like tucked into a shirt and it was
fucked up on pills and he was just

2047
01:19:18,081 --> 01:19:21,860
sweating.
He picked up for days and he's at the

2048
01:19:21,861 --> 01:19:24,770
table read.
And that was before he decided to clean

2049
01:19:24,771 --> 01:19:27,920
his act up.
I was lucky enough to come across like,

2050
01:19:28,190 --> 01:19:29,840
well,
after those days,

2051
01:19:30,320 --> 01:19:31,300
uh,
and we,

2052
01:19:31,340 --> 01:19:33,710
they wrote,
they wrote a script to fuck with him.

2053
01:19:33,711 --> 01:19:37,400
They gave him the wrong script with like
extra lines with a monologue that took

2054
01:19:37,401 --> 01:19:39,860
up like the whole page so that he would
have to remember it.

2055
01:19:39,890 --> 01:19:40,151
We,
no,

2056
01:19:40,151 --> 01:19:41,150
no.
He'd had to read it.

2057
01:19:41,180 --> 01:19:43,970
And everyone's like jen cheap.
They tell everybody like,

2058
01:19:43,971 --> 01:19:45,560
don't worry about that part where he
thinks he's a bird.

2059
01:19:45,830 --> 01:19:47,160
And so bobby's like,
I'm a burden.

2060
01:19:47,280 --> 01:19:48,980
It's supposed to.
And like the writer was coaching.

2061
01:19:48,981 --> 01:19:50,960
I'm just like,
do the wackiest bird boy.

2062
01:19:51,230 --> 01:19:52,200
And he's like,
God,

2063
01:19:52,250 --> 01:19:54,940
God's supposed to fly and I'm a burden
I,

2064
01:19:54,990 --> 01:19:58,250
and he looks up and we're crying,
laughing and you see someone screaming,

2065
01:19:58,400 --> 01:20:00,500
fuck you got any through the script
across the room.

2066
01:20:00,501 --> 01:20:01,970
And I remember just taking pictures of
yeah,

2067
01:20:01,971 --> 01:20:03,770
just to,
they just did it.

2068
01:20:03,771 --> 01:20:06,260
I like on his birthday or something to
Mesh that was like the best prank.

2069
01:20:06,290 --> 01:20:09,980
Wasn't mad tv like the longest running
sketch show ever outside of center line?

2070
01:20:10,110 --> 01:20:10,950
It was.
Yeah.

2071
01:20:11,100 --> 01:20:12,810
That's crazy.
Nobody watched it.

2072
01:20:13,200 --> 01:20:15,660
It 10 people watch that show.
It costs too much.

2073
01:20:15,750 --> 01:20:16,710
I think that what it was,
yeah,

2074
01:20:16,711 --> 01:20:18,900
because they do a lot of like,
um,

2075
01:20:19,590 --> 01:20:21,360
song parodies and things like that.

2076
01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:22,560
And,
and uh,

2077
01:20:22,650 --> 01:20:23,670
it,
it just,

2078
01:20:24,090 --> 01:20:26,250
I mean,
I wish it would've kept going.

2079
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:27,780
It was one,
of course you were working on it,

2080
01:20:28,020 --> 01:20:29,550
but it was one of those things where it
was like,

2081
01:20:29,551 --> 01:20:31,170
you'd see here it was still on.
You're like,

2082
01:20:31,171 --> 01:20:32,760
Whoa,
that show's still on.

2083
01:20:32,790 --> 01:20:35,340
Oh yeah.
Cause I was on it with Brian Callen in

2084
01:20:35,341 --> 01:20:40,341
1994 Brian Cowen and Artie Lange like 94
95 95 that's crazy.

2085
01:20:41,700 --> 01:20:43,290
Long fucking time ago.
Yeah.

2086
01:20:43,380 --> 01:20:45,840
And then all those years later,
I'm like,

2087
01:20:45,841 --> 01:20:47,220
what?
It's still on dude.

2088
01:20:47,221 --> 01:20:51,060
When I got the call to audition or was
that still on the television?

2089
01:20:51,090 --> 01:20:54,840
This was 2008 that is shocking.
Crazy.

2090
01:20:54,841 --> 01:20:59,841
Yeah.
2009 it ended 1995 to 2009 that's

2091
01:21:00,391 --> 01:21:02,850
insane.
We shot the last,

2092
01:21:03,240 --> 01:21:07,920
they cancelled it,
I want to say January of 2009 and it

2093
01:21:07,921 --> 01:21:09,020
was,
they canceled it on my,

2094
01:21:09,510 --> 01:21:11,310
they told everyone in my day on my day
off.

2095
01:21:11,670 --> 01:21:12,960
Oh,
so it was original network.

2096
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:15,990
He was on Fox.
And why does it say the CW to try to

2097
01:21:15,991 --> 01:21:18,510
bring it back.
Tried to bring it back.

2098
01:21:18,540 --> 01:21:21,780
Yeah.
With like what Adam Ray was on it and a

2099
01:21:21,781 --> 01:21:22,950
couple people,
I don't know.

2100
01:21:22,980 --> 01:21:25,500
But what is the CW,
is that a real,

2101
01:21:25,650 --> 01:21:29,730
oh look there I am set up like a drug
dealers money laundering operation.

2102
01:21:29,731 --> 01:21:31,380
The CW network.
What is that?

2103
01:21:31,860 --> 01:21:32,910
Is it like those,
damn,

2104
01:21:33,160 --> 01:21:36,870
I live south of Glendale and there's a,
there's a banquet hall every two blocks.

2105
01:21:36,871 --> 01:21:38,930
I'm like there is some laundering.
Come on.

2106
01:21:38,940 --> 01:21:40,650
That's got to be some Geek,
some easy laundering.

2107
01:21:40,660 --> 01:21:41,940
Right.
Banquet Hall.

2108
01:21:42,090 --> 01:21:43,950
But just trying to figure out a way to
get rid of money.

2109
01:21:44,190 --> 01:21:45,760
Yeah.
Cause you got to move it around.

2110
01:21:46,210 --> 01:21:48,780
Justify the race to say there isn't a a
wedding,

2111
01:21:49,320 --> 01:21:50,790
two weddings a day.
Couple of weddings.

2112
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:52,050
Yeah,
sure.

2113
01:21:52,340 --> 01:21:52,970
Yeah.
Well,

2114
01:21:52,970 --> 01:21:57,840
well that you got to think that if
you're a person in this day and age that

2115
01:21:57,841 --> 01:21:59,820
you selling drugs and you're trying to
launder money,

2116
01:21:59,821 --> 01:22:01,710
you have to be super sophisticated about
it.

2117
01:22:01,980 --> 01:22:04,320
That's the hardest part.
If you are making millions of dollars

2118
01:22:04,321 --> 01:22:06,390
selling drugs,
how do you,

2119
01:22:06,810 --> 01:22:08,760
you know,
you have to own like laundromats or

2120
01:22:08,761 --> 01:22:11,450
something.
Like you can't be like a Pablo Escobar

2121
01:22:11,460 --> 01:22:12,900
moving the money from the bottom of the
top.

2122
01:22:12,990 --> 01:22:15,690
It'll rot like fruit.
Like there's so many rats in there.

2123
01:22:15,810 --> 01:22:16,700
I was at a,
uh,

2124
01:22:17,220 --> 01:22:19,130
oh,
this is the best way to describe this

2125
01:22:19,140 --> 01:22:20,010
up.
Giving anybody up.

2126
01:22:20,070 --> 01:22:24,370
I was at a luxury automobile place.
Ah,

2127
01:22:24,480 --> 01:22:27,420
and uh,
this one gentleman came in who is in the

2128
01:22:27,421 --> 01:22:29,040
rap game.
Sure.

2129
01:22:29,160 --> 01:22:32,850
And He,
they had a large bag of money.

2130
01:22:33,480 --> 01:22:35,040
They were looking at Lamborghini's.
I'm,

2131
01:22:35,080 --> 01:22:37,530
I wasn't looking at Lamborghinis when
you do,

2132
01:22:37,531 --> 01:22:38,790
she bought a Lamborghini.
No,

2133
01:22:39,330 --> 01:22:43,290
but they sell them at this place and uh,
this guy had a bet and they were

2134
01:22:43,291 --> 01:22:45,450
bringing out the,
the money counter,

2135
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:46,650
uh,
money counting machine.

2136
01:22:47,370 --> 01:22:49,020
Like scarface.
Scarface.

2137
01:22:49,021 --> 01:22:49,320
Yeah.

2138
01:22:49,320 --> 01:22:50,880
Like this is how they were going to buy
a car.

2139
01:22:50,910 --> 01:22:53,490
That's fantastic.
I guess if you're in the rap game,

2140
01:22:53,520 --> 01:22:55,350
that's how they like to buy a car.
Sure.

2141
01:22:55,460 --> 01:23:00,460
Till like to just like throw a duffle
bag full of cash and buy a car and then

2142
01:23:00,721 --> 01:23:01,650
you're done.
You're done.

2143
01:23:01,860 --> 01:23:02,693
It's like,
no,

2144
01:23:02,900 --> 01:23:04,260
wait my wire to come through.
No,

2145
01:23:04,340 --> 01:23:05,171
here you go.
I,

2146
01:23:05,171 --> 01:23:06,130
uh,
my,

2147
01:23:06,160 --> 01:23:06,730
my,
uh,

2148
01:23:06,730 --> 01:23:08,500
my,
I used to work with a business manager

2149
01:23:08,501 --> 01:23:12,910
who used to work with high end sports as
high on the athletes and she's like,

2150
01:23:12,911 --> 01:23:14,260
oh,
like I was just like,

2151
01:23:14,320 --> 01:23:15,820
can you eat,
set this up or some transfer?

2152
01:23:15,821 --> 01:23:16,810
She's like,
listen,

2153
01:23:17,140 --> 01:23:21,880
you'll never make my job as hard as
trying to get a Lamborghini dealer to

2154
01:23:21,881 --> 01:23:25,270
open at midnight in Las Vegas where a
client wants to buy one.

2155
01:23:25,970 --> 01:23:27,370
So many wins.
Yeah,

2156
01:23:27,590 --> 01:23:30,400
there's something,
I want to buy a lambo right now.

2157
01:23:32,440 --> 01:23:34,690
Coked out of their fucking mind how to
get married.

2158
01:23:34,730 --> 01:23:38,320
I'm going to buy a loom bright purple.
Who is that picture is his future either

2159
01:23:38,330 --> 01:23:40,510
rappers to him older than a million
dollar future.

2160
01:23:40,511 --> 01:23:42,160
His future is very,
very popular.

2161
01:23:42,280 --> 01:23:46,030
There's future and it looks like he's
got some stray hundreds in that a ring

2162
01:23:46,031 --> 01:23:47,920
finger.
You're slipping through his fingers.

2163
01:23:48,340 --> 01:23:51,340
Do you think he has a fuck hole cut in
the,

2164
01:23:51,341 --> 01:23:52,090
in the money,
right?

2165
01:23:52,090 --> 01:23:55,570
He's fucking that really well,
his pants are down very low and see

2166
01:23:55,620 --> 01:23:56,920
notice.
Good,

2167
01:23:56,921 --> 01:23:58,250
good point.
Okay.

2168
01:23:58,251 --> 01:24:00,880
It might be a,
might have a fleshlight paled into that

2169
01:24:01,030 --> 01:24:03,730
stack of cash.
So he's got $1 million in cash.

2170
01:24:03,880 --> 01:24:07,420
How much you have that Mike Tyson back
in the height of his,

2171
01:24:07,421 --> 01:24:10,420
his of his is heavyweight rain.
He used to carry like something like

2172
01:24:10,421 --> 01:24:12,940
$20,000 on a middle time.
Just something insane.

2173
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:13,850
That's normal,
isn't it?

2174
01:24:13,851 --> 01:24:15,600
Yeah.
Well it's for a rapper.

2175
01:24:15,680 --> 01:24:17,240
It 20 grand is,
that's not funny,

2176
01:24:17,340 --> 01:24:21,370
but I'm talking the eighties but I
remember reading that article as a kid,

2177
01:24:21,371 --> 01:24:24,040
it'd be like Christ and I,
I went through two thoughts.

2178
01:24:24,340 --> 01:24:25,750
Isn't he afraid of getting robbed?
Of course not.

2179
01:24:26,110 --> 01:24:28,120
Of course.
Not Going to rob Mike Tyson.

2180
01:24:29,740 --> 01:24:31,750
He's going to find you unless you kill
him.

2181
01:24:32,140 --> 01:24:34,300
He's gonna.
He's gonna find he's going to sit on you

2182
01:24:34,301 --> 01:24:36,930
and punch your head until it's jelly.
It says broke.

2183
01:24:36,940 --> 01:24:38,920
Yeah.
That was after 50 cent file for

2184
01:24:38,921 --> 01:24:39,731
bankruptcy.
Right,

2185
01:24:39,731 --> 01:24:42,430
because like women were coming after him
for child support.

2186
01:24:42,640 --> 01:24:46,840
So he said he was bankrupt,
but he also made hundreds of millions of

2187
01:24:46,840 --> 01:24:48,730
dollars off of vitamin water.
Yeah.

2188
01:24:48,731 --> 01:24:50,650
He made a killing with that vitamin
water deal.

2189
01:24:50,740 --> 01:24:53,500
Yeah.
He's got some weird bankruptcy thing.

2190
01:24:53,580 --> 01:24:54,820
It was,
it was child support.

2191
01:24:54,880 --> 01:24:59,090
Is that what got him in the end
because no,

2192
01:24:59,380 --> 01:25:01,840
I don't think it got him cause he was
avoiding it.

2193
01:25:01,870 --> 01:25:05,410
He never should have wrapped,
have a baby by me baby be a millionaire.

2194
01:25:05,510 --> 01:25:07,810
I'll write the check for the baby comes,
who the fuck cares.

2195
01:25:07,930 --> 01:25:10,480
So like he said that since,
I mean you're setting yourself up there.

2196
01:25:10,481 --> 01:25:11,800
I guess he cares.
Yeah.

2197
01:25:12,100 --> 01:25:17,100
Well the thing is after a while when you
don't have a hit record out in like a

2198
01:25:17,740 --> 01:25:18,220
decade,
right.

2199
01:25:18,220 --> 01:25:21,220
You're like hey this shit could dry up.
Yeah.

2200
01:25:21,320 --> 01:25:24,330
Like maybe I need to go bankrupt and
stop paying these ladies and he's,

2201
01:25:27,180 --> 01:25:29,620
it's a cash only business.
He probably has it all hidden.

2202
01:25:29,650 --> 01:25:32,740
I don't know what he did.
Like he bought the vitamin water thing

2203
01:25:32,741 --> 01:25:34,210
isn't cash only.
I don't know how,

2204
01:25:34,480 --> 01:25:36,330
I don't know how that guy is a dollar
spent.

2205
01:25:36,370 --> 01:25:39,520
So you're bankrupt.
That's really is I think,

2206
01:25:39,580 --> 01:25:42,370
I think your theory is probably sound of
him just being like,

2207
01:25:43,580 --> 01:25:46,360
ah.
I think it was literally because of

2208
01:25:46,361 --> 01:25:46,600
that.

2209
01:25:46,600 --> 01:25:50,040
Like someone was trying to hit him up
either for alimony or child support and

2210
01:25:50,041 --> 01:25:51,160
he was like,
I got an idea,

2211
01:25:51,820 --> 01:25:54,130
I'm just going to hire some financial
wizards.

2212
01:25:54,830 --> 01:25:56,050
Work there.
Sorcery.

2213
01:25:56,590 --> 01:25:58,930
Yeah.
Dig a hole buried in the ground.

2214
01:25:59,230 --> 01:26:01,960
It is weird that people give people
money.

2215
01:26:02,430 --> 01:26:04,370
Like,
like you break up and go,

2216
01:26:04,371 --> 01:26:06,560
okay,
well now you got to give them money.

2217
01:26:06,920 --> 01:26:08,990
Like I get it if you have a child to
sport.

2218
01:26:09,110 --> 01:26:10,410
Totally makes sense.
Right.

2219
01:26:10,460 --> 01:26:14,210
But like if you dated someone for a
couple of years and then you married him

2220
01:26:14,420 --> 01:26:16,910
and then why you're married,
you made $1 million that didn't make

2221
01:26:16,911 --> 01:26:18,110
anything and you're like,
Hey,

2222
01:26:18,111 --> 01:26:19,730
I want to have that money.
Like what?

2223
01:26:19,740 --> 01:26:21,290
Three strange,
not together anymore.

2224
01:26:21,750 --> 01:26:22,281
Yay.
Yeah.

2225
01:26:22,281 --> 01:26:22,880
But,
uh,

2226
01:26:22,880 --> 01:26:24,770
I want money.
I want money from you.

2227
01:26:25,400 --> 01:26:28,400
Are you going to do half of my set on
the road for now on?

2228
01:26:28,430 --> 01:26:28,651
No,
no,

2229
01:26:28,651 --> 01:26:28,940
no,
no.

2230
01:26:28,940 --> 01:26:31,100
But I want you to support my lifestyle.
Oh,

2231
01:26:31,250 --> 01:26:33,500
I'm used to a certain lifestyle.
That's another thing that gets me,

2232
01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:35,990
that people used to a certain lifestyle.
That guy,

2233
01:26:36,020 --> 01:26:37,370
the guy who,
uh,

2234
01:26:37,700 --> 01:26:39,110
Joan Collins,
I dunno,

2235
01:26:39,170 --> 01:26:41,480
16th husband or something.
I remember he,

2236
01:26:41,540 --> 01:26:43,580
that was his thing in court.
Like your honor,

2237
01:26:43,581 --> 01:26:46,670
my client has grown accustomed to a
certain lifestyle and that was all over

2238
01:26:46,671 --> 01:26:48,440
the news and it was just like,
ah,

2239
01:26:48,470 --> 01:26:50,730
come on.
Custom.

2240
01:26:50,750 --> 01:26:52,610
Like you can't change,
you cannot change.

2241
01:26:52,611 --> 01:26:55,490
Right.
There's no way you could live a middle

2242
01:26:55,491 --> 01:26:58,130
class life anymore.
It's that those days are done.

2243
01:26:58,430 --> 01:26:59,660
Okay.
It's upward.

2244
01:26:59,810 --> 01:27:01,810
It's only upward will you probably can't
you,

2245
01:27:01,840 --> 01:27:05,580
you can't fly anything less than first
class now can you probably I've flow.

2246
01:27:05,610 --> 01:27:06,990
Yeah.
Fly southwest sometimes.

2247
01:27:07,700 --> 01:27:08,900
Good for you.
Yeah.

2248
01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:10,520
It's just a fucking plane.
Yeah,

2249
01:27:10,740 --> 01:27:12,000
it's good.
But I,

2250
01:27:12,010 --> 01:27:14,120
I know people that if they have to sit
and like,

2251
01:27:14,121 --> 01:27:15,440
I remember when,
when,

2252
01:27:15,550 --> 01:27:17,420
uh,
during the whatever recession or

2253
01:27:17,421 --> 01:27:19,640
something,
there's some video of,

2254
01:27:19,700 --> 01:27:21,800
of puff daddy getting on a plane and he
was like,

2255
01:27:21,801 --> 01:27:23,990
he's like,
your boy isn't flying private.

2256
01:27:24,020 --> 01:27:25,310
We've got to fix these problems,
man.

2257
01:27:25,311 --> 01:27:26,870
I've got to fly first class.
And you just like,

2258
01:27:27,200 --> 01:27:30,800
why would I give a shit?
You're boy isn't flying private.

2259
01:27:30,830 --> 01:27:31,820
Oh my God.
Yeah.

2260
01:27:31,821 --> 01:27:32,930
It was amazing.
Thank you.

2261
01:27:32,990 --> 01:27:35,630
Thank you for tweeting about this.
I was worried about the government

2262
01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:38,600
shutdown and yelling at yelling at it,
and this was like 10 years ago,

2263
01:27:38,601 --> 01:27:39,920
but like yelling at the,
at the,

2264
01:27:39,950 --> 01:27:42,830
whoever's filming them on Tmz and,
and I think about the person that's in

2265
01:27:42,831 --> 01:27:47,180
like group D for that plane where they
call you and it's just like you and like

2266
01:27:47,181 --> 01:27:50,630
a stray dog that gets left on the plane.
Was he saying he wasn't flying private

2267
01:27:50,631 --> 01:27:53,600
because the money wasn't flowing because
the economy was low?

2268
01:27:53,790 --> 01:27:54,740
Yeah,
that was his point.

2269
01:27:54,770 --> 01:27:55,431
Yeah.
Yeah.

2270
01:27:55,431 --> 01:27:57,140
And there's someone that's like,
ah,

2271
01:27:57,260 --> 01:28:01,940
I use my last check to get on this plane
to see about a job offer and Tulsa.

2272
01:28:02,140 --> 01:28:04,310
Oh Jesus.
He's one of those guys.

2273
01:28:04,311 --> 01:28:07,400
Like he had some fucking billboard on
sunset.

2274
01:28:07,401 --> 01:28:08,390
There was like,
can't stop.

2275
01:28:08,391 --> 01:28:09,650
Won't stop.
And it was like,

2276
01:28:09,651 --> 01:28:10,820
all right,
I thought you stopped.

2277
01:28:11,540 --> 01:28:14,610
I didn't know he didn't stop.
He keeps the line.

2278
01:28:14,630 --> 01:28:16,640
I thought I told you that we don't stop.
Can't stop,

2279
01:28:16,641 --> 01:28:17,570
won't stop.
It's like,

2280
01:28:17,571 --> 01:28:18,291
yeah,
we had told you that.

2281
01:28:18,291 --> 01:28:19,460
We don't stop.
We,

2282
01:28:19,461 --> 01:28:22,160
you told us to stop you.
I haven't seen you in awhile.

2283
01:28:22,340 --> 01:28:23,550
You didn't stop.
Yeah.

2284
01:28:23,600 --> 01:28:25,400
Well what's he been doing while he
wasn't around?

2285
01:28:25,430 --> 01:28:26,930
He didn't stop.
What does he do?

2286
01:28:26,960 --> 01:28:30,560
It was 2008 because the gas prices were
too high so he stopped flying private.

2287
01:28:30,590 --> 01:28:31,700
That's what it was.
Thank you.

2288
01:28:31,701 --> 01:28:35,360
Gas prices.
It wasn't okay [inaudible] got to fix

2289
01:28:35,361 --> 01:28:38,330
this problem for puff daddy or ptsd or
whatever.

2290
01:28:38,331 --> 01:28:41,990
Like if I was playing stadiums or
something like that in 2008 and I got on

2291
01:28:41,991 --> 01:28:46,820
a plane and yelled at it like a tmz
thing and someone just creased my brow

2292
01:28:46,821 --> 01:28:49,340
with a brick,
like just hit me in the face earned.

2293
01:28:49,580 --> 01:28:51,010
Completely earned.
You know,

2294
01:28:52,040 --> 01:28:54,680
I don't think violence is the answer.
That's true.

2295
01:28:54,681 --> 01:28:55,240
I'm,
I'm,

2296
01:28:55,240 --> 01:28:57,050
I'm,
I'm I speaking dramatically.

2297
01:28:57,051 --> 01:28:59,870
But you know,
it's almost like that guy.

2298
01:28:59,871 --> 01:29:02,670
You ever been in line waiting to plane
and someone just starts playing music

2299
01:29:02,790 --> 01:29:07,020
and you're like c'mon man.
Like those rolling speakers on like a DJ

2300
01:29:07,021 --> 01:29:09,120
or something.
This is the thing that guys do at the

2301
01:29:09,121 --> 01:29:11,770
gym.
They bring their own small speaker and

2302
01:29:11,820 --> 01:29:14,370
overpower the music that's playing over
the,

2303
01:29:14,490 --> 01:29:16,350
no,
like what the fuck is that?

2304
01:29:16,351 --> 01:29:18,180
That happened to Tony and I in Toronto.
We were like,

2305
01:29:18,181 --> 01:29:21,840
what the fuck is this?
This guy just playing this shitty music

2306
01:29:21,841 --> 01:29:23,460
like really loud,
like techno

2307
01:29:25,230 --> 01:29:28,740
brutal brings his own music and you got
to listen to him because you're right

2308
01:29:28,741 --> 01:29:31,830
next to the lat pull down machine.
Fuck you man.

2309
01:29:32,220 --> 01:29:34,680
Well earbuds just to get by some ear
buds.

2310
01:29:34,920 --> 01:29:38,250
People are weird.
They're weird with their lack of

2311
01:29:38,251 --> 01:29:40,290
appreciation for other people.
Yeah.

2312
01:29:40,470 --> 01:29:44,130
Well the people that like watch their
ipads or like a phone and they watch

2313
01:29:44,131 --> 01:29:47,820
something with the volume on and I've
twice,

2314
01:29:47,850 --> 01:29:49,680
I'm not a very confrontational person,
but I'm just like,

2315
01:29:49,681 --> 01:29:50,940
Hey,
can you put some ear buds in?

2316
01:29:51,210 --> 01:29:53,400
And they're like,
I don't have any like can turn the sound

2317
01:29:53,401 --> 01:29:54,234
off.
And they're like,

2318
01:29:54,330 --> 01:29:55,780
oh,
they gave me a look like,

2319
01:29:56,040 --> 01:29:57,330
like I said,
something like,

2320
01:29:57,510 --> 01:29:59,250
you know,
take your pants off.

2321
01:29:59,400 --> 01:30:01,650
It makes you feel more calm if you would
take your pants off.

2322
01:30:01,890 --> 01:30:02,401
You know,
like I said,

2323
01:30:02,401 --> 01:30:04,350
somebody that insane,
but they like,

2324
01:30:04,530 --> 01:30:08,850
they just look at me like I got it.
People listen to your stupid shit.

2325
01:30:08,851 --> 01:30:09,780
It's,
it's just,

2326
01:30:09,810 --> 01:30:11,400
it's,
it's distracting.

2327
01:30:11,401 --> 01:30:12,510
It's grading.
Well,

2328
01:30:12,511 --> 01:30:15,270
it's weird as a,
you'll go to a restaurant and you'll see

2329
01:30:15,271 --> 01:30:18,840
two kids sitting opposite of each other
with ipads.

2330
01:30:18,840 --> 01:30:22,170
They basically bring a portable
television and they're both watching a

2331
01:30:22,171 --> 01:30:23,004
different thing.
Yeah.

2332
01:30:23,190 --> 01:30:28,190
And it's like this sound,
these conflicting sound of two child's

2333
01:30:28,561 --> 01:30:32,040
programs going back and forth and kids
are the opposite side of the table and

2334
01:30:32,130 --> 01:30:34,530
the loud,
I was at a restaurant the other day and

2335
01:30:34,531 --> 01:30:38,580
there was two children and two parents
and no one was talking to each other.

2336
01:30:38,760 --> 01:30:42,480
The Dad was looking at his phone,
the wife was looking at her phone to

2337
01:30:42,540 --> 01:30:44,280
kids.
We're looking at IPADS and no one was

2338
01:30:44,281 --> 01:30:46,020
communicating.
They just sit in there like everyone

2339
01:30:46,021 --> 01:30:47,280
looked depressed.
There were all fat.

2340
01:30:47,670 --> 01:30:49,890
They don't have game rooms anymore
though.

2341
01:30:50,130 --> 01:30:52,560
Like when I was growing up,
we would go to a restaurant,

2342
01:30:52,950 --> 01:30:55,500
get a dollar game room for an hour until
the food came.

2343
01:30:55,770 --> 01:30:57,390
Yeah.
Dollar for what?

2344
01:30:57,391 --> 01:30:59,540
An hour.
We'll put that water back,

2345
01:30:59,660 --> 01:31:02,730
the quarterback,
then you can play four games and an

2346
01:31:02,730 --> 01:31:03,360
hour.

2347
01:31:03,360 --> 01:31:04,950
I didn't lose share.
He was amazing.

2348
01:31:05,720 --> 01:31:07,650
Kaylin and asteroids,
you get free games.

2349
01:31:07,920 --> 01:31:09,870
A Donkey Kong,
you a pinball wizard.

2350
01:31:10,200 --> 01:31:12,290
Now we as the pinball is a little too
old for me.

2351
01:31:13,210 --> 01:31:14,060
Pull position.
You know.

2352
01:31:14,190 --> 01:31:16,410
Ever since you were a young boy,
you played the several ball.

2353
01:31:17,010 --> 01:31:18,810
Yeah,
it's coming back for sure.

2354
01:31:18,811 --> 01:31:21,510
There's like leagues and all sorts of,
it's like made a retro.

2355
01:31:21,540 --> 01:31:24,030
Pinball is hard.
I know a dude who goes,

2356
01:31:24,031 --> 01:31:25,530
yeah,
he plays in pin ball league.

2357
01:31:25,570 --> 01:31:28,800
That's so impressive.
He's got pinball machines at his

2358
01:31:28,801 --> 01:31:31,280
restaurant.
That's amazing shit out of him.

2359
01:31:31,300 --> 01:31:32,970
But did you have to be good at something
like that?

2360
01:31:32,971 --> 01:31:35,760
It's just,
it's fruitless.

2361
01:31:36,950 --> 01:31:38,450
It's fruitless,
but it's impressive.

2362
01:31:38,451 --> 01:31:40,080
You know?
It's like someone who's really good at

2363
01:31:40,081 --> 01:31:40,914
like,
um,

2364
01:31:41,400 --> 01:31:42,740
like lawn darts.
Yeah.

2365
01:31:43,290 --> 01:31:44,220
Dick.
Fuck Bro.

2366
01:31:44,250 --> 01:31:45,880
There was a guy,
there was a guy,

2367
01:31:46,710 --> 01:31:48,750
king of [inaudible].
King of long darts,

2368
01:31:48,751 --> 01:31:49,461
Bro.
Yeah.

2369
01:31:49,461 --> 01:31:49,921
Like,
Hey,

2370
01:31:49,921 --> 01:31:51,870
this is the world's strongest man.
That's great and all.

2371
01:31:51,871 --> 01:31:55,320
But I'm the king of lawn darts.
I fucking rule.

2372
01:31:55,321 --> 01:32:00,160
I've given my life to lawn dark brown
who used to be these big ass weaponized

2373
01:32:00,160 --> 01:32:00,881
lawn darts.
Oh,

2374
01:32:00,881 --> 01:32:03,790
you could kill someone with them.
Lawn darts used to be like a small

2375
01:32:03,791 --> 01:32:06,370
football when the throat dagger would
just come straight.

2376
01:32:06,371 --> 01:32:09,880
Yeah.
Those are like hatchet throwing or like

2377
01:32:09,881 --> 01:32:12,110
axe throwing places.
I've made like a little bit of a

2378
01:32:12,340 --> 01:32:13,420
resurgence,
but I've seen it.

2379
01:32:13,421 --> 01:32:15,400
They becoming popular now in all the
major cities.

2380
01:32:15,410 --> 01:32:17,560
You know why?
Cause girls in their underwear on

2381
01:32:17,561 --> 01:32:21,720
instagram with throwing hatchets yeah,
like Aubrey and his girlfriend when

2382
01:32:22,060 --> 01:32:26,250
throwing hatchets at targets and their
underwear and the man cave men need it.

2383
01:32:26,470 --> 01:32:28,690
Need a new way to be violent during
drinking.

2384
01:32:28,840 --> 01:32:31,810
You know,
like it's just throwing an ax or it's

2385
01:32:31,811 --> 01:32:33,550
also very retro.
Yes.

2386
01:32:33,820 --> 01:32:34,810
Yeah.
It's very biking.

2387
01:32:35,350 --> 01:32:39,550
Yes.
Sam does acts as always land the right

2388
01:32:39,551 --> 01:32:41,440
way.
That's what always Fripp freaks me out.

2389
01:32:41,500 --> 01:32:43,840
But like it would,
my handle would bounce off the wall and

2390
01:32:43,841 --> 01:32:45,910
it would just fly somewhere weird in a
movie.

2391
01:32:45,940 --> 01:32:50,940
The guy grabs the knife by the blade
like this and it always lands with the

2392
01:32:51,221 --> 01:32:54,130
blade in the body.
Imagine someone threw a knife at you and

2393
01:32:54,131 --> 01:32:55,570
the handle hit like this,
you're like,

2394
01:32:55,600 --> 01:32:57,580
oh bitch,
you just gave him a knife.

2395
01:32:58,480 --> 01:33:00,650
This knife,
and I'm going to hold off after your

2396
01:33:00,710 --> 01:33:03,640
death grip and slide in your rib cage.
As you mentioned this yesterday,

2397
01:33:03,641 --> 01:33:06,280
but did someone duals that were in a lot
of duals?

2398
01:33:06,300 --> 01:33:08,080
I heard a stat.
I didn't,

2399
01:33:08,140 --> 01:33:11,560
I never knew about it that Andrew
Jackson was in something like a hundred

2400
01:33:11,561 --> 01:33:13,870
tools,
but he only killed one person.

2401
01:33:13,871 --> 01:33:17,370
I thought he killed a lot of,
usually get shot in the arm or like,

2402
01:33:17,371 --> 01:33:20,540
you know,
like a musket ball would go your leg,

2403
01:33:20,541 --> 01:33:22,510
or the one where he killed the guy.
He actually,

2404
01:33:22,511 --> 01:33:24,520
it was a,
I forget the guy's name,

2405
01:33:24,521 --> 01:33:26,920
but he was known as being a really good
doula.

2406
01:33:26,920 --> 01:33:29,230
He killed a lots of p like 26 people or
something like that.

2407
01:33:29,560 --> 01:33:34,090
So he challenged this guy and he thought
the only way to win would be to let him

2408
01:33:34,091 --> 01:33:36,880
take the first shot.
So he let him take the first shot,

2409
01:33:36,940 --> 01:33:39,160
got hit in the chest,
was bleeding,

2410
01:33:40,030 --> 01:33:43,540
covered the hole,
and then shot the guy and he died.

2411
01:33:44,140 --> 01:33:45,460
Whoa.
You shot him in the head of the city,

2412
01:33:45,461 --> 01:33:48,580
fell immediately and then died like a
couple hours later I think.

2413
01:33:48,581 --> 01:33:50,440
I don't know if he was the president at
the time,

2414
01:33:51,100 --> 01:33:55,540
but the doctor said like,
I don't know how you stood and took that

2415
01:33:55,541 --> 01:33:59,230
shot and he said if he shot me in the
brain I wasn't going to stand and take

2416
01:33:59,231 --> 01:34:00,820
that shot to kill this guy.
I don't know if you said like

2417
01:34:00,821 --> 01:34:03,470
motherfucker or whatever,
but like Andrew Jackson was crazy guy.

2418
01:34:03,471 --> 01:34:05,110
He's a crazy dude.
Like where his,

2419
01:34:05,111 --> 01:34:07,630
where he is,
where the statue of him is and I'm in

2420
01:34:07,631 --> 01:34:09,130
Jackson Square in New Orleans.

2421
01:34:09,280 --> 01:34:11,260
There's that church,
this behind it and that,

2422
01:34:11,290 --> 01:34:15,340
this is why New Orleans is supposedly
the most haunted city is because they'd

2423
01:34:15,341 --> 01:34:20,230
had the most duals because once Andrew
Jackson contacted John Laffite and was

2424
01:34:20,231 --> 01:34:21,190
like,
I need an army.

2425
01:34:21,191 --> 01:34:22,660
And John the feet was basically a
gangster,

2426
01:34:22,661 --> 01:34:24,610
which is basically someone that can get
you anything.

2427
01:34:24,640 --> 01:34:28,420
Like that's what a connected guy does.
And so he got him freed slaves,

2428
01:34:28,421 --> 01:34:30,820
native Americans,
creoles cajuns and just,

2429
01:34:30,990 --> 01:34:33,430
you know,
angry men and they repelled the British.

2430
01:34:33,431 --> 01:34:37,360
But then they stayed and they just lived
in the bars and they were dual happy

2431
01:34:37,361 --> 01:34:40,900
because their egos were so big and I've
looked for these and I can't find him.

2432
01:34:41,050 --> 01:34:44,650
What they had was dueling cards where if
you had one it would say Joe Rogan have

2433
01:34:44,651 --> 01:34:47,500
your face,
you know probably that image and it

2434
01:34:47,501 --> 01:34:50,500
would say you know dueling card and
someone bumped into you and you were

2435
01:34:50,501 --> 01:34:51,820
like,
you just give them your card and be

2436
01:34:51,821 --> 01:34:53,470
like,
see you in the morning and mother fucker

2437
01:34:53,500 --> 01:34:55,390
and that means we're,
we're shooting it out.

2438
01:34:55,660 --> 01:34:56,890
Whoa.
You would do over.

2439
01:34:57,830 --> 01:34:58,160
And

2440
01:34:58,160 --> 01:35:00,710
the guy I went in this go this ghost
tour and the guy taught me,

2441
01:35:00,711 --> 01:35:05,060
they told me this story and he said,
imagine the amount of guys who are hung

2442
01:35:05,061 --> 01:35:06,080
over.
I woke up like,

2443
01:35:06,140 --> 01:35:07,610
Oh fuck,
what did I do?

2444
01:35:08,060 --> 01:35:11,210
I've got a dual now.
And you'd go behind that cemetery.

2445
01:35:11,211 --> 01:35:14,810
That's where they'd have their dual.
And imagine laying there with a bullet

2446
01:35:14,811 --> 01:35:17,150
or a piece of round led and your liver
and calling like,

2447
01:35:17,180 --> 01:35:20,180
I'm dead over this shit.
I stepped on my foot.

2448
01:35:20,750 --> 01:35:22,560
They'd keep cards like,
dude,

2449
01:35:23,150 --> 01:35:24,620
no,
this is just like a picture of one.

2450
01:35:24,650 --> 01:35:26,900
They also said that lot,
a lot of times the uh,

2451
01:35:27,100 --> 01:35:30,020
the dual wouldn't actually happen.
Like they might not actually shoot.

2452
01:35:30,080 --> 01:35:32,510
It was more of a test of will of like,
yeah,

2453
01:35:32,550 --> 01:35:34,610
will you just go through with it?
Yeah,

2454
01:35:34,611 --> 01:35:37,400
it was all honor and they'd have to
bring a second guy to make to like

2455
01:35:37,401 --> 01:35:40,670
verify that the dual actually went down
and said one was a pussy or whatever.

2456
01:35:40,670 --> 01:35:42,350
You serious?
He's like the judge,

2457
01:35:44,780 --> 01:35:46,700
he's laying odds.
It's like,

2458
01:35:47,680 --> 01:35:48,520
he's like,
ah,

2459
01:35:48,580 --> 01:35:50,510
there's certain states were duals or
legal.

2460
01:35:50,511 --> 01:35:53,570
I think there's still legal in Arizona
or they used to be because there was a

2461
01:35:53,571 --> 01:35:57,530
cop who shot someone in a dual like
years back.

2462
01:35:57,560 --> 01:35:58,590
Really?
Yeah.

2463
01:35:58,610 --> 01:35:59,960
It was a,
it was a weird thing.

2464
01:35:59,961 --> 01:36:04,250
Like a cop was off duty and he shot
someone in a dual,

2465
01:36:05,460 --> 01:36:07,520
oh man.
I want to say this is more than 10 years

2466
01:36:07,521 --> 01:36:08,840
ago.
So maybe they changed the law,

2467
01:36:08,990 --> 01:36:12,730
but I remember reading that going,
what you can you do all that shit.

2468
01:36:12,740 --> 01:36:15,400
Same Texas,
but well yeah,

2469
01:36:15,440 --> 01:36:19,200
this only,
what's that fist fucking dude,

2470
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:20,833
what is that?
Well,

2471
01:36:20,860 --> 01:36:24,290
kill combat.
How do you take 10 paces in Washington

2472
01:36:24,291 --> 01:36:26,560
state as mutual combat law?
I just,

2473
01:36:26,650 --> 01:36:31,280
cause I know I watched a video of this
dude who was a mma fighter.

2474
01:36:31,280 --> 01:36:33,970
He used to dress up like a superhero and
fuck people up in,

2475
01:36:34,700 --> 01:36:38,930
he would like stop people from
committing crimes and then fight them.

2476
01:36:39,140 --> 01:36:42,920
And then one video,
Carlos Photo photo or I think his name

2477
01:36:42,921 --> 01:36:47,120
was,
he was fighting someone in Seattle,

2478
01:36:47,121 --> 01:36:50,210
in front of cops.
Like some guy agreed to fight him and

2479
01:36:50,211 --> 01:36:52,550
then you see right away what a terrible
idea it is.

2480
01:36:52,820 --> 01:36:54,680
And he laid,
kicks the guy and the guy's got this

2481
01:36:54,681 --> 01:36:55,640
look on his face like,
oh my God,

2482
01:36:55,641 --> 01:36:59,150
you actually know how to fight.
He beats the shit out of Phoenix Jones.

2483
01:36:59,151 --> 01:37:00,320
Yeah,
that's what he's called himself.

2484
01:37:00,321 --> 01:37:03,570
Phoenix dressed.
But watch this video of it here.

2485
01:37:03,630 --> 01:37:05,330
You can see it on that one too.
This is exactly,

2486
01:37:05,331 --> 01:37:05,621
yeah,
yeah,

2487
01:37:05,621 --> 01:37:07,520
yeah.
So the guys like,

2488
01:37:07,521 --> 01:37:09,590
fuck you all.
Fuck fucking kick your ass and this is

2489
01:37:09,591 --> 01:37:10,760
in front of the cops.
It's like,

2490
01:37:10,761 --> 01:37:12,380
fuck you.
And he's like,

2491
01:37:12,381 --> 01:37:13,960
you know,
you think you're going to get,

2492
01:37:13,990 --> 01:37:17,530
and he's wearing this superhero costume
on and he's like,

2493
01:37:17,660 --> 01:37:18,493
give me some,

2494
01:37:20,060 --> 01:37:21,930
he's telling the backup.
You guys walking towards

2495
01:37:28,420 --> 01:37:30,520
see you see him wearing that outfit?
Yes.

2496
01:37:30,550 --> 01:37:32,020
And you think,
oh,

2497
01:37:32,080 --> 01:37:37,030
I could kick this guy's ass for sure.
This guy's a clown fucking cosplay Dork.

2498
01:37:37,960 --> 01:37:39,370
But watch that.
Skip ahead.

2499
01:37:40,570 --> 01:37:41,590
He's like,
okay.

2500
01:37:43,330 --> 01:37:48,280
So the guy wouldn't stop badgering them.
And then finally in front of the cops,

2501
01:37:48,310 --> 01:37:50,500
they agreed to let these dudes duke it
out.

2502
01:37:50,501 --> 01:37:52,960
Holy Shit.
That's it right there.

2503
01:37:53,020 --> 01:37:54,220
Let it go there.
Watch this.

2504
01:37:55,710 --> 01:37:56,370
Oh,

2505
01:37:56,370 --> 01:38:00,410
that's when you know you made a mistake.
The first leg moving around.

2506
01:38:00,840 --> 01:38:01,220
Yeah.

2507
01:38:01,220 --> 01:38:03,980
And again,
you got to useless and he's turning to

2508
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:09,000
kick too.
He jabbed him to the body.

2509
01:38:10,520 --> 01:38:11,660
Yeah.
You fucked up.

2510
01:38:11,690 --> 01:38:13,760
Wow.
God,

2511
01:38:13,761 --> 01:38:17,240
this guy's life.
That third leg done,

2512
01:38:17,600 --> 01:38:19,760
that third leg kicks a real problem.

2513
01:38:22,510 --> 01:38:23,343
Yeah.

2514
01:38:24,470 --> 01:38:25,700
Oh,
the fourth leg kick.

2515
01:38:25,830 --> 01:38:26,620
Yup.

2516
01:38:26,620 --> 01:38:27,453
Wow.

2517
01:38:28,360 --> 01:38:30,570
That guy is basically hopping around on
one leg now.

2518
01:38:30,750 --> 01:38:31,770
Now.
Now it's a beating.

2519
01:38:32,830 --> 01:38:34,180
That's it.
That's rap.

2520
01:38:34,210 --> 01:38:35,240
Yup.
That's right.

2521
01:38:37,160 --> 01:38:38,690
Mutual combat.
You're right.

2522
01:38:38,870 --> 01:38:42,260
Yeah.
It's a mutual that law and cops are

2523
01:38:42,261 --> 01:38:45,080
standing by watching this Guy Gabe
brained.

2524
01:38:45,500 --> 01:38:48,500
That's what's crazy is like it's very
irresponsible for the cops cause that's

2525
01:38:48,501 --> 01:38:50,270
not a good fighting surface.
Yeah,

2526
01:38:50,490 --> 01:38:54,320
we'll have a,
you have a padded area they set aside.

2527
01:38:54,710 --> 01:38:57,070
There's a,
there's a great line from a buck Koski

2528
01:38:57,080 --> 01:39:00,860
novel where these guys are all gathering
after like a night out or something and

2529
01:39:00,861 --> 01:39:03,270
his guys hung over and he's just like,
he's like,

2530
01:39:03,271 --> 01:39:04,610
Hey,
I heard you got in a fight and he's just

2531
01:39:04,611 --> 01:39:05,690
like,
Oh man,

2532
01:39:05,930 --> 01:39:08,000
that guy had to be a pro.
Beat me so bad.

2533
01:39:08,001 --> 01:39:11,240
I shit myself.
Like that always gets me because it's

2534
01:39:11,241 --> 01:39:13,400
that thing where it's like when you
fight someone who's whatever,

2535
01:39:13,401 --> 01:39:13,881
what,
okay.

2536
01:39:13,881 --> 01:39:15,800
It's a fight but like when you fight a
pro,

2537
01:39:15,830 --> 01:39:18,290
it's just done.
Well it's like playing basketball if you

2538
01:39:18,291 --> 01:39:19,900
don't know how to play basketball.
Yes.

2539
01:39:20,460 --> 01:39:24,230
What a terrible thing.
Y'all place one on one and you don't

2540
01:39:24,231 --> 01:39:26,590
even know how to dribble this guys
dunking on him.

2541
01:39:26,600 --> 01:39:29,900
Like Shit.
Like why did I agree to this?

2542
01:39:29,930 --> 01:39:34,720
Is there a state where it's legal to
dual but there's no firearm?

2543
01:39:35,280 --> 01:39:35,931
When,
what,

2544
01:39:35,931 --> 01:39:40,310
how long ago was it still legal?
The late 18 hundreds I believe so.

2545
01:39:40,600 --> 01:39:42,680
So maybe this guy did it.
He was a cop.

2546
01:39:43,250 --> 01:39:45,680
He,
he had a dual with a guy who was fucking

2547
01:39:45,681 --> 01:39:46,820
his wife.
Whoa.

2548
01:39:47,180 --> 01:39:48,680
Yeah,
that's what's up.

2549
01:39:49,140 --> 01:39:49,973
Yeah.

2550
01:39:50,660 --> 01:39:52,760
And he just killed the guy.
I Dunno.

2551
01:39:53,310 --> 01:39:55,970
I don't remember the story entirely.
And he definitely killed somebody.

2552
01:39:56,120 --> 01:39:58,790
Jesus,
when was he was a cop.

2553
01:39:58,791 --> 01:40:01,280
I remember the whole story being that it
was very controversial,

2554
01:40:01,281 --> 01:40:02,660
but,
but it was legal.

2555
01:40:03,140 --> 01:40:07,360
Maybe I'm remembering it all fucked up.
Hmm.

2556
01:40:07,630 --> 01:40:08,960
It might've been more than 10 years ago.

2557
01:40:11,350 --> 01:40:14,030
Five places where it's okay to shoot
someone states.

2558
01:40:14,410 --> 01:40:15,310
Oh,
okay.

2559
01:40:15,311 --> 01:40:16,780
Yeah.
It's like international waters.

2560
01:40:17,650 --> 01:40:19,780
You get to a duel and unlike a cruise
ship.

2561
01:40:19,870 --> 01:40:22,120
So how does that work?
Like if you're on one of them,

2562
01:40:22,121 --> 01:40:25,150
carnival cruises and some guy in salts,
your name and throws Jello at you.

2563
01:40:25,190 --> 01:40:26,950
The laws of the ship or whichever
country.

2564
01:40:27,870 --> 01:40:31,540
I know about the international waters,
but like a cruise ship would be out and

2565
01:40:32,050 --> 01:40:33,190
that's nuts.
You know what,

2566
01:40:33,191 --> 01:40:35,860
I'm worried about cruise ships that I
would be on the deck when some guy

2567
01:40:35,861 --> 01:40:40,270
throws his wife off off the side of the
boat and you got to do something like

2568
01:40:40,990 --> 01:40:42,460
that does happen.
Yeah.

2569
01:40:42,560 --> 01:40:44,920
Husband and wife went on a cruise.
The wife can went missing.

2570
01:40:44,950 --> 01:40:46,660
I don't know what happened.
I went to bed early.

2571
01:40:46,690 --> 01:40:48,550
I mean Trisha kept partying.
We,

2572
01:40:48,551 --> 01:40:50,470
yeah,
we had an argument but we are a deeply

2573
01:40:50,471 --> 01:40:51,570
in love.
And uh,

2574
01:40:51,970 --> 01:40:54,060
we had a couple of,
I know people saw us

2575
01:40:54,060 --> 01:40:55,060
screaming and a,
and a,

2576
01:40:55,061 --> 01:40:57,040
and I might have slapped her a couple
times,

2577
01:40:57,041 --> 01:41:00,280
but uh,
boy I love her and her disappearing and

2578
01:41:00,281 --> 01:41:01,114
what's fucked up.

2579
01:41:01,160 --> 01:41:03,230
I learned from a buddy of mine who was
on,

2580
01:41:03,231 --> 01:41:06,590
he was with did second city Tour Cup
touring company or Turco and they were

2581
01:41:06,591 --> 01:41:10,370
on a cruise ship and he was telling me
that they found out that like all the

2582
01:41:10,371 --> 01:41:13,340
foods you don't eat,
they grind it all up and just shoot it

2583
01:41:13,341 --> 01:41:15,530
out in the water.
It's that attracts game fish and the

2584
01:41:15,531 --> 01:41:18,110
game fish attract sharks.
So anytime there's a,

2585
01:41:18,170 --> 01:41:20,450
there's a cruise ship,
there's just sharks all the time.

2586
01:41:21,930 --> 01:41:22,740
Really?
Yeah.

2587
01:41:22,740 --> 01:41:24,610
So,
so if you went overboard,

2588
01:41:24,611 --> 01:41:25,950
yeah.
Debts not,

2589
01:41:25,951 --> 01:41:27,540
there's not a lot of hope.
Oh,

2590
01:41:27,541 --> 01:41:28,620
good Christ.
Yeah.

2591
01:41:28,650 --> 01:41:33,180
Did you see that video of that woman in
Hawaii swimming around with the largest

2592
01:41:33,181 --> 01:41:35,310
known great white shark?
No,

2593
01:41:35,550 --> 01:41:39,330
it's amazing.
It's a more than 20 foot long,

2594
01:41:39,331 --> 01:41:41,550
great white shark.
And it's not like,

2595
01:41:41,551 --> 01:41:43,920
guess where she's just swimming around
women with it.

2596
01:41:43,921 --> 01:41:45,840
Yeah.
In the water swimming with it.

2597
01:41:46,290 --> 01:41:47,610
Yeah.
She's got a,

2598
01:41:47,670 --> 01:41:52,670
an instagram page is filled with photos
of her and this shark fuck off.

2599
01:41:52,980 --> 01:41:55,770
Awahoo it's so big.
It's so big.

2600
01:41:55,771 --> 01:41:59,070
It doesn't even look real.
And she's just swimming alongside this

2601
01:41:59,071 --> 01:42:00,960
thing.
It's a female shark.

2602
01:42:00,961 --> 01:42:03,390
It's like 20,
20 feet long at least.

2603
01:42:03,720 --> 01:42:07,040
So she just saw it and to swim up.
I think she's like a,

2604
01:42:07,050 --> 01:42:08,160
an expert.
Oh,

2605
01:42:08,161 --> 01:42:09,630
okay.
See if you can find that.

2606
01:42:10,380 --> 01:42:12,450
I got stuck in another article about the
dual,

2607
01:42:12,451 --> 01:42:13,930
sorry to go back.
Sorry.

2608
01:42:14,630 --> 01:42:18,300
S uh,
Oregon has a law that they were trying

2609
01:42:18,301 --> 01:42:20,400
to get rid of two years ago.
I don't know.

2610
01:42:20,401 --> 01:42:21,920
I'm trying to find out where they
currently are.

2611
01:42:21,930 --> 01:42:23,250
This gun,
where is Dick is?

2612
01:42:23,280 --> 01:42:25,540
That's a stat,
that whole stressor,

2613
01:42:26,040 --> 01:42:27,520
but it's still that,
uh,

2614
01:42:27,560 --> 01:42:31,560
here Republicans and opposed to scrap
172 year old ban on duals for public

2615
01:42:31,561 --> 01:42:32,210
officials.

2616
01:42:32,210 --> 01:42:34,600
Ooh.
I think their tech to highlight how many

2617
01:42:34,601 --> 01:42:38,260
arcane logs are still upheld,
but that's where I'm from.

2618
01:42:38,320 --> 01:42:41,290
I never knew I could have been dueling.
All this public official.

2619
01:42:41,710 --> 01:42:42,311
Well,
no,

2620
01:42:42,311 --> 01:42:42,880
they're,
they're,

2621
01:42:42,880 --> 01:42:46,870
they're trying to scrap the band so
they're trying to reinstate bands to let

2622
01:42:46,871 --> 01:42:49,120
people know how stupid these old laws
are.

2623
01:42:49,121 --> 01:42:51,700
They're still on the books.
She's a state decided it would not be

2624
01:42:51,701 --> 01:42:54,220
very civil of two members of the
legislature.

2625
01:42:54,730 --> 01:42:58,720
Legislature disagreed and then shot each
other on the front steps of the

2626
01:42:58,721 --> 01:43:00,650
provisional combat.
It's a bad look.

2627
01:43:01,090 --> 01:43:02,560
It's a bad,
yeah.

2628
01:43:02,830 --> 01:43:07,830
It gotta be cool though to see like Ted
Cruz and Paul Ryan standing on back to

2629
01:43:08,351 --> 01:43:11,280
back.
They have to use the muskets.

2630
01:43:11,630 --> 01:43:14,800
One coq one shot.
That's it.

2631
01:43:15,370 --> 01:43:20,170
I like in the upper right hand corner
Amaga hat board refuses to apologize and

2632
01:43:20,560 --> 01:43:24,070
infuriating interview.
That kid looked drugged and coached,

2633
01:43:24,400 --> 01:43:25,540
like he was just,
we both,

2634
01:43:25,570 --> 01:43:27,260
yeah,
it probably put them on some PROZAC.

2635
01:43:27,490 --> 01:43:28,450
Get out there.
A little fellow.

2636
01:43:29,140 --> 01:43:31,180
Apparently that native American guy
though,

2637
01:43:31,210 --> 01:43:33,970
they did an interview with him and it
was a disaster because he said a bunch

2638
01:43:33,971 --> 01:43:36,130
of things that just absolutely weren't
true.

2639
01:43:36,131 --> 01:43:39,520
And they're questioning whether or not
he actually was in Vietnam.

2640
01:43:39,760 --> 01:43:43,540
He definitely didn't serve in Vietnam,
but he wasn't in combat.

2641
01:43:43,560 --> 01:43:44,720
Right.
But you know,

2642
01:43:44,740 --> 01:43:49,740
he had some,
some conflicting stories and none of

2643
01:43:50,171 --> 01:43:52,160
these people were prepared for this kind
of attention.

2644
01:43:52,160 --> 01:43:55,520
You know,
it's like I was offended as as hell by

2645
01:43:55,521 --> 01:43:59,360
those kids and I'm a fucking big old
bleeding heart lefty for sure.

2646
01:43:59,361 --> 01:44:01,160
And I hate those,
those fucking hats.

2647
01:44:01,161 --> 01:44:04,070
But like I,
I in the state at the same time,

2648
01:44:04,520 --> 01:44:07,370
every teenage boy is a fucking idiot.
Everyone,

2649
01:44:07,371 --> 01:44:08,790
you know,
and like it's,

2650
01:44:08,870 --> 01:44:12,800
but those boys were standing there doing
their school chance while these,

2651
01:44:12,840 --> 01:44:15,590
there's a long video and the video is
two hours long.

2652
01:44:15,620 --> 01:44:18,020
I haven't watched it,
but I've watched segments of it.

2653
01:44:18,021 --> 01:44:21,170
And in the segments of it,
you see those native American guys walk

2654
01:44:21,171 --> 01:44:23,900
up to those boys and chance with their
drums.

2655
01:44:23,960 --> 01:44:25,340
So they're all there for different
reasons.

2656
01:44:25,341 --> 01:44:27,740
Yeah.
So the boys were there for the march for

2657
01:44:27,741 --> 01:44:30,920
life,
which is a pro life march there from a

2658
01:44:30,921 --> 01:44:34,850
Catholic school and they were in their
stupid red hats and then the native

2659
01:44:34,851 --> 01:44:36,920
American guy was there is for for
different reasons.

2660
01:44:36,950 --> 01:44:38,480
Yeah,
there were a couple,

2661
01:44:38,481 --> 01:44:39,231
there was,
there was a,

2662
01:44:39,231 --> 01:44:43,730
it was a native American celebration.
That's their yearly and you think they

2663
01:44:43,731 --> 01:44:46,430
coordinate these things but it's just,
there's all these different,

2664
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:51,020
so a sort of marches going on and that's
all that's our right as citizens.

2665
01:44:51,021 --> 01:44:54,620
But it's just that they were all in the
Lincoln memorial together.

2666
01:44:54,650 --> 01:44:58,340
Well not only that,
these boys did not have like a good

2667
01:44:58,341 --> 01:45:00,350
chaperon.
Like these boys were wild.

2668
01:45:00,730 --> 01:45:03,290
They yelled,
they said something like it's not rape.

2669
01:45:03,291 --> 01:45:04,700
If they enjoy it,
enjoy it.

2670
01:45:04,701 --> 01:45:06,080
Yeah.
One kid yelled at again,

2671
01:45:06,081 --> 01:45:08,420
by the way,
there's 40 kids want,

2672
01:45:08,450 --> 01:45:11,660
if you have one asshole kid doesn't mean
everybody should be beat up because one

2673
01:45:11,661 --> 01:45:15,290
of your stupid fucking classmates has
something really dumb because he thinks

2674
01:45:15,291 --> 01:45:16,850
he's funny.
And he was 15.

2675
01:45:16,880 --> 01:45:20,690
I sat in an in an assembly once where a
friend of mine was in like,

2676
01:45:20,720 --> 01:45:22,170
uh,
in Chicago to Freeman.

2677
01:45:22,220 --> 01:45:25,880
I was doing a play and they were doing
like a scene from the play on stage and

2678
01:45:25,970 --> 01:45:27,620
a woman would come on stage and they
would,

2679
01:45:27,980 --> 01:45:28,970
these kids,
these boys,

2680
01:45:28,971 --> 01:45:32,390
I'm behind him and they're saying the
worst shit I can imagine.

2681
01:45:32,540 --> 01:45:35,690
And it just like Jesus Christ.
And it was,

2682
01:45:35,720 --> 01:45:37,820
it's that,
it's that it's the race to the bottom

2683
01:45:37,821 --> 01:45:41,060
like boys or it's like,
who can say the worst thing I can write,

2684
01:45:41,090 --> 01:45:41,770
I can,
yeah.

2685
01:45:41,770 --> 01:45:43,070
Can Yell The n word.
You know,

2686
01:45:43,430 --> 01:45:45,070
it's staying where it shows your tits.
Yeah.

2687
01:45:45,300 --> 01:45:48,980
Or just trying to make a lot of,
because what's the worst thing?

2688
01:45:48,981 --> 01:45:50,870
Rape.
And so this kid is gonna yell something

2689
01:45:50,871 --> 01:45:53,630
about race and it's,
it's uh,

2690
01:45:54,240 --> 01:45:55,640
their children.
Yeah.

2691
01:45:55,730 --> 01:45:58,040
Yeah.
I do feel they need better supervision,

2692
01:45:58,430 --> 01:46:02,120
but here's the thing they do for sure.
But there shouldn't be judged publicly

2693
01:46:02,121 --> 01:46:04,730
on a global scale like this shop fair.

2694
01:46:05,030 --> 01:46:07,720
Yeah.
I mean I disagree with uh,

2695
01:46:07,790 --> 01:46:10,490
pretty much everything them and their
parents stand for and stuff,

2696
01:46:10,491 --> 01:46:13,190
but it's their right to demonstrate,
you know what I mean?

2697
01:46:13,191 --> 01:46:15,110
So not,
I mean they look,

2698
01:46:15,140 --> 01:46:20,140
they are too young to know what the fuck
they're even demonstrating about to

2699
01:46:20,481 --> 01:46:24,380
really have a good argument about it.
Like to bring kids to a pro life

2700
01:46:24,381 --> 01:46:28,250
demonstration,
have them chant and yelder schools songs

2701
01:46:28,251 --> 01:46:30,050
and,
and put on magna hats.

2702
01:46:30,051 --> 01:46:32,330
Like the whole thing is so fucked up.
It's really,

2703
01:46:32,360 --> 01:46:33,350
well we're,
I mean,

2704
01:46:33,380 --> 01:46:36,590
back to what I said about anxiety,
it's just we're at each other's fucking

2705
01:46:36,610 --> 01:46:37,670
throat.
I mean,

2706
01:46:37,671 --> 01:46:40,400
I have a bit of my act about how like,
um,

2707
01:46:40,640 --> 01:46:43,100
I,
I feel like the Internet was built for

2708
01:46:43,101 --> 01:46:45,980
us to tear each other apart because
we're just throwing darts and running

2709
01:46:45,981 --> 01:46:49,230
away.
And if you put us in a room together and

2710
01:46:49,231 --> 01:46:50,400
talk it out,
we,

2711
01:46:50,820 --> 01:46:53,100
I think we,
I think we would mano a mano.

2712
01:46:53,440 --> 01:46:54,330
You'd,
because people,

2713
01:46:54,370 --> 01:46:56,010
the people,
we all want the same thing.

2714
01:46:56,100 --> 01:46:57,840
Yeah.
Deep down inside we all want to take

2715
01:46:57,841 --> 01:46:59,100
care of our kids.
We all want to have fun.

2716
01:46:59,101 --> 01:47:01,170
We all want a bountiful life,
you know?

2717
01:47:01,171 --> 01:47:03,120
But I also say like,
I'm also like,

2718
01:47:03,210 --> 01:47:06,570
I love people,
but I fucking hate people.

2719
01:47:06,600 --> 01:47:08,640
Like it's like,
you know,

2720
01:47:08,641 --> 01:47:11,340
it's like if you go through a whole day
without speaking to another human being,

2721
01:47:11,341 --> 01:47:12,870
you ever had one of those days.
Fuck.

2722
01:47:12,871 --> 01:47:14,280
That was awesome.
Isolation.

2723
01:47:14,340 --> 01:47:16,890
That was delicious.
It's only if you have too much though,

2724
01:47:17,070 --> 01:47:17,820
right?
If you get,

2725
01:47:17,820 --> 01:47:20,160
get around people too much,
then those game days where you just,

2726
01:47:20,460 --> 01:47:23,660
you could just recharge and then you
appreciate people when you see him.

2727
01:47:23,670 --> 01:47:24,630
Yeah.
And like,

2728
01:47:24,900 --> 01:47:26,310
do you ever get that where you,
where you go to,

2729
01:47:26,311 --> 01:47:27,810
you're on the way,
the comedy store and you're like,

2730
01:47:27,840 --> 01:47:28,830
I want to fucking go.

2731
01:47:29,130 --> 01:47:30,480
Like,
I don't want to go up right now.

2732
01:47:30,530 --> 01:47:31,770
I'm like,
something's masked with me.

2733
01:47:31,771 --> 01:47:35,580
But it's like that with therapy,
comedy sometimes.

2734
01:47:35,581 --> 01:47:38,370
And the gym sometimes where it's like,
I don't want to fucking go,

2735
01:47:38,371 --> 01:47:40,500
but every time I'm glad I did.
You know what I mean?

2736
01:47:40,830 --> 01:47:43,530
I know what you're saying.
I could have a set where I'd eat shit

2737
01:47:43,531 --> 01:47:45,360
and I'll drive home laughing and I'm
just like,

2738
01:47:45,361 --> 01:47:48,120
well that didn't work.
The thing that bothers me most about

2739
01:47:48,121 --> 01:47:51,960
this is that they wanted the docs,
these kids and po address out there

2740
01:47:51,990 --> 01:47:54,570
favor of that ever.
It's just so foolish ever.

2741
01:47:54,690 --> 01:47:57,780
And they're treating them like they're
rational adults that are,

2742
01:47:57,781 --> 01:48:00,440
you know,
fucking 50 years old.

2743
01:48:00,441 --> 01:48:01,640
It really know what they're doing.
No,

2744
01:48:01,650 --> 01:48:03,270
and it's not going to solve anything.
It's new.

2745
01:48:03,271 --> 01:48:06,330
You're not going to convert these kids'
hearts and minds by ruining their lives.

2746
01:48:07,200 --> 01:48:10,380
I do understand the double standard we
have had with like black youth though,

2747
01:48:10,381 --> 01:48:11,680
where it's kind of like,
uh,

2748
01:48:11,790 --> 01:48:14,160
you know,
this kid gets strangled to death for

2749
01:48:14,161 --> 01:48:15,240
selling cigarettes.
We were like,

2750
01:48:15,241 --> 01:48:15,990
yeah,
he's a criminal.

2751
01:48:15,990 --> 01:48:17,430
He's like,
God dammit.

2752
01:48:17,460 --> 01:48:19,770
You know?
Whereas these kids honestly,

2753
01:48:19,771 --> 01:48:21,780
cause they're wider getting chance after
chance after chance,

2754
01:48:21,870 --> 01:48:23,850
but I don't think their last should be
ruined.

2755
01:48:23,970 --> 01:48:24,870
It's like,
I feel like we've,

2756
01:48:24,900 --> 01:48:26,820
we've,
we've talked enough about it.

2757
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:28,950
These kids did what they did.
Let's move on.

2758
01:48:29,280 --> 01:48:30,290
Yeah.
Well then you know,

2759
01:48:30,330 --> 01:48:31,950
who knows what they're getting chance
after chance.

2760
01:48:31,951 --> 01:48:36,690
But during this situation like this is,
this is the consequences of social

2761
01:48:36,691 --> 01:48:38,430
media.
The fact that you could take a video of

2762
01:48:38,431 --> 01:48:41,310
someone doing something incredibly
stupid when they're 16 years old.

2763
01:48:41,311 --> 01:48:42,900
Yeah.
And what they did was not even that

2764
01:48:42,901 --> 01:48:45,060
stupid.
All he did to stand there and smirk and

2765
01:48:45,061 --> 01:48:45,894
people wanted him.

2766
01:48:46,390 --> 01:48:49,460
He was being a shithead.
But like I keep a yc,

2767
01:48:49,470 --> 01:48:52,110
if he's just standing there and someone
comes up to him beating a drum,

2768
01:48:52,140 --> 01:48:53,720
how are you supposed to react?
I feel like the,

2769
01:48:53,721 --> 01:48:55,920
how do you think you would react?
I feel like the kid walked up to the

2770
01:48:55,921 --> 01:48:58,440
native Americans didn't correct
incorrect.

2771
01:48:58,860 --> 01:49:01,560
The kid was standing there,
the native American walked up to him and

2772
01:49:01,570 --> 01:49:02,403
the drama.
Okay.

2773
01:49:02,410 --> 01:49:04,120
Walked,
got rid of the video with sound.

2774
01:49:04,220 --> 01:49:05,280
What happened?
What do you mean?

2775
01:49:05,330 --> 01:49:07,510
The guy was,
that kid wasn't in the video where the

2776
01:49:07,850 --> 01:49:10,680
native American gentlemen was standing
there playing his drum and there are

2777
01:49:10,681 --> 01:49:13,620
kids around him.
But that kid that the main kid wasn't

2778
01:49:13,621 --> 01:49:14,490
there,
he walked,

2779
01:49:14,491 --> 01:49:16,110
he ended up walking up to them.
Yeah.

2780
01:49:16,170 --> 01:49:18,420
Okay.
But with the video that I saw,

2781
01:49:18,450 --> 01:49:21,360
the kid was standing there and that guy
walked up to him.

2782
01:49:21,990 --> 01:49:23,850
Here's the thing,
and this is two hours.

2783
01:49:24,270 --> 01:49:26,670
There's the,
there's video of these people that's two

2784
01:49:26,671 --> 01:49:29,850
hours long,
and the video that I saw,

2785
01:49:29,880 --> 01:49:34,350
those kids were standing there chanting
and that guy walked to those kids and

2786
01:49:34,351 --> 01:49:39,240
was beating his drum.
If that one specific kid walked down,

2787
01:49:39,270 --> 01:49:43,620
but still that guy instigated it by
walking to them beating the drum.

2788
01:49:43,770 --> 01:49:47,040
Not only that,
that guy got in that kid's face and beat

2789
01:49:47,230 --> 01:49:50,920
drum inches away from his face,
but I thought this is also talking about

2790
01:49:50,921 --> 01:49:52,990
that kid.
I thought that kid walked up to the,

2791
01:49:53,020 --> 01:49:54,520
to the native American.
I'm not sure.

2792
01:49:54,521 --> 01:49:56,600
The native American guy walked up to the
whole group.

2793
01:49:56,790 --> 01:49:58,930
Okay.
I haven't seen all that.

2794
01:49:58,990 --> 01:50:02,650
All of that video I saw American guys
said that there were saying build that

2795
01:50:02,651 --> 01:50:03,640
wall,
build that wall.

2796
01:50:03,641 --> 01:50:05,440
But there's no evidence of that.
Okay.

2797
01:50:05,560 --> 01:50:08,800
The Guy,
the problem is the guy's a human in

2798
01:50:08,810 --> 01:50:10,150
native American guys in human,
right.

2799
01:50:10,410 --> 01:50:14,320
And he's probably not prepared at all
for this kind of scrutiny.

2800
01:50:14,530 --> 01:50:16,440
And no one is,
there's a lot there.

2801
01:50:16,450 --> 01:50:19,270
There was an interview that he did with
CNN that is just full of holes.

2802
01:50:19,300 --> 01:50:20,470
Okay.
And uh,

2803
01:50:20,500 --> 01:50:23,530
it doesn't match up to the video.
It doesn't match up to what happened and

2804
01:50:23,540 --> 01:50:26,190
his like theirs,
you can pull it,

2805
01:50:26,191 --> 01:50:27,580
pull it video.
I'll pull that article.

2806
01:50:28,990 --> 01:50:31,690
But you've tried to find that article,
the CNN article.

2807
01:50:32,490 --> 01:50:35,500
There was an article about the article
that I read.

2808
01:50:35,860 --> 01:50:37,150
Either way I,
yeah,

2809
01:50:37,151 --> 01:50:39,460
I'm just,
I'm just inundated at this point with

2810
01:50:39,461 --> 01:50:40,840
all of it.
I will say like,

2811
01:50:41,470 --> 01:50:42,430
you know,
I've,

2812
01:50:42,490 --> 01:50:45,070
I've said for years,
probably 15,

2813
01:50:45,071 --> 01:50:47,680
20 years now.
I'm so glad youtube did not exist when I

2814
01:50:47,681 --> 01:50:48,880
was in high school.
Oh my God.

2815
01:50:49,440 --> 01:50:52,810
Cause you're just interesting book
twitter,

2816
01:50:52,840 --> 01:50:56,740
the things you would say on twitter or
snapchat or any of those things.

2817
01:50:56,770 --> 01:50:58,150
Yeah.
And I mean,

2818
01:50:58,450 --> 01:51:01,180
I did not grow up like,
you know,

2819
01:51:01,181 --> 01:51:05,830
my parents generation being mildly
racist if you're white,

2820
01:51:05,890 --> 01:51:07,120
you know,
I grew up,

2821
01:51:07,320 --> 01:51:09,820
uh,
pretty woke as the kids say in Portland,

2822
01:51:09,821 --> 01:51:11,360
Oregon.
So in Chicago,

2823
01:51:11,390 --> 01:51:13,540
Chicago is pretty left wing will
chicago.

2824
01:51:13,541 --> 01:51:15,310
I was,
I wasn't there until I was born in

2825
01:51:15,311 --> 01:51:16,600
Chicago,
but I grew up in Portland.

2826
01:51:16,720 --> 01:51:17,810
Oh.
And then I was more,

2827
01:51:18,430 --> 01:51:19,660
yeah,
but it was also,

2828
01:51:20,410 --> 01:51:21,430
it's funny,
we had,

2829
01:51:21,460 --> 01:51:22,330
uh,
we had,

2830
01:51:22,390 --> 01:51:27,220
we had right wing a Nazi groups moving
in when I was in high school,

2831
01:51:27,380 --> 01:51:29,890
uh,
gangs from La and then from central

2832
01:51:29,891 --> 01:51:32,260
Oregon and further toward Idaho.
You had,

2833
01:51:32,350 --> 01:51:33,430
you had a,
this,

2834
01:51:33,431 --> 01:51:35,920
the skinny metzger who had like a little
little camp,

2835
01:51:35,950 --> 01:51:39,010
you could go on partying if you've seen
in American history x.

2836
01:51:39,011 --> 01:51:41,890
It was just like that drink free beer
and they'd play punk rock music.

2837
01:51:41,890 --> 01:51:45,340
And the thing that everyone misses when
they look at those groups,

2838
01:51:45,341 --> 01:51:49,540
be it a gang or a white supremacist
skinhead group or whatever.

2839
01:51:49,880 --> 01:51:50,610
It's,
it's,

2840
01:51:50,610 --> 01:51:52,600
it's a community for,
for people.

2841
01:51:52,660 --> 01:51:54,650
And that's where they look at it first
and then they,

2842
01:51:54,651 --> 01:51:55,890
they,
they foreign communities,

2843
01:51:55,891 --> 01:51:59,200
sadly over focusing hate.
But I just feel like,

2844
01:51:59,340 --> 01:52:00,250
okay,
it's back here.

2845
01:52:00,330 --> 01:52:01,070
Yeah.
I mean,

2846
01:52:01,070 --> 01:52:05,080
which kit?
So they're all,

2847
01:52:05,140 --> 01:52:08,020
they walked up to him being in there
banging the drums.

2848
01:52:08,450 --> 01:52:10,510
That's the kid there and he's standing
there.

2849
01:52:10,540 --> 01:52:11,740
Yeah.
Okay.

2850
01:52:11,770 --> 01:52:13,350
Yeah,
there's a kid now,

2851
01:52:13,420 --> 01:52:15,460
but like he did,
but he's just standing there.

2852
01:52:15,580 --> 01:52:17,830
The guy walked right up to him.
You're showing me in the video,

2853
01:52:17,831 --> 01:52:20,980
the guy walking up to the kid and this
is exactly what I said,

2854
01:52:20,981 --> 01:52:22,690
Jamie.
He walked right up to the kid.

2855
01:52:22,720 --> 01:52:24,250
My point here was this,
the video,

2856
01:52:24,260 --> 01:52:28,780
I mean are these kids all mocking the
traditional native American music and

2857
01:52:28,781 --> 01:52:29,680
rhythm,
but Jamie,

2858
01:52:29,860 --> 01:52:34,240
that native American guy just walked up
to that kid and got in his face.

2859
01:52:34,241 --> 01:52:37,070
It's as clear as day.
I was just bringing up this like there's

2860
01:52:37,120 --> 01:52:38,800
this angle here.
He's standing here.

2861
01:52:38,830 --> 01:52:42,040
There's a group of kids who are out on
the kids might managing this thing

2862
01:52:42,110 --> 01:52:45,170
doesn't make any sense.
It's just the worst for Philip to the

2863
01:52:45,171 --> 01:52:46,070
kids.
He

2864
01:52:46,070 --> 01:52:49,520
walked up to the kids.
Any walked up to that kid specifically

2865
01:52:49,521 --> 01:52:51,890
got in his face.
There was a certain amount of separation

2866
01:52:51,891 --> 01:52:54,400
between them.
He walked to the kid and got in his face

2867
01:52:54,401 --> 01:52:56,310
while he's beating the drum.
I okay,

2868
01:52:56,540 --> 01:52:57,950
play it again.
I'm bikes right now.

2869
01:52:57,951 --> 01:53:00,140
He's the guy,
he's walking,

2870
01:53:00,800 --> 01:53:04,220
he's walking and the kid standing there
and when the kid standing that he walks

2871
01:53:04,221 --> 01:53:05,180
up to the kid.

2872
01:53:06,930 --> 01:53:09,180
So when they're doing the Tomahawk Chop
Chop,

2873
01:53:09,181 --> 01:53:12,360
they think it's funny.
Like did they understand that people are

2874
01:53:12,361 --> 01:53:14,560
filming?
They don't.

2875
01:53:14,910 --> 01:53:19,830
So here he goes.
The whole thing is so strange.

2876
01:53:19,831 --> 01:53:22,950
So strange.
Because what are you supposed to do when

2877
01:53:22,951 --> 01:53:25,350
someone walks up to you beating a drum?
So there's the kid,

2878
01:53:25,351 --> 01:53:29,880
the kid standing there and the native
American guy now walks up to him

2879
01:53:29,881 --> 01:53:34,740
completely violating a space.
Now imagine if this is a man doing this

2880
01:53:34,741 --> 01:53:36,000
to a woman.
You'd say,

2881
01:53:36,001 --> 01:53:39,000
okay,
he's violating her space 100% this is

2882
01:53:39,001 --> 01:53:41,640
fucked up and aggressive.
And that's what this guy's doing.

2883
01:53:41,641 --> 01:53:44,250
He's singing in this kid's face.
It's a little kid.

2884
01:53:45,570 --> 01:53:47,360
And what is the kid supposed to do?
I don't know.

2885
01:53:47,390 --> 01:53:49,060
Should he walk away?
Shitty.

2886
01:53:49,080 --> 01:53:54,080
Say I'm sorry that someone in the past
stole your ancestors land.

2887
01:53:54,210 --> 01:53:55,470
What is he supposed to do?
Yeah,

2888
01:53:55,530 --> 01:53:57,300
I mean it's no,
I'm not saying yes,

2889
01:53:57,480 --> 01:53:58,030
do that.

2890
01:53:58,030 --> 01:53:59,040
You know,
I'm saying what is the,

2891
01:53:59,090 --> 01:54:00,720
like the question is what does your kid
do?

2892
01:54:00,780 --> 01:54:02,880
But I mean these,
it's just he's,

2893
01:54:03,630 --> 01:54:06,060
I get why this guy is approaching
because there's just a,

2894
01:54:06,120 --> 01:54:09,150
it's a river of people mocking him and
his culture.

2895
01:54:09,210 --> 01:54:11,430
I get it.
But why this one kid and why?

2896
01:54:11,431 --> 01:54:14,850
Why get right in this guy's face or
you're beating a drum inches from this

2897
01:54:14,851 --> 01:54:15,684
kid's face.
Yeah,

2898
01:54:15,890 --> 01:54:17,580
that is the question and what?
Look,

2899
01:54:17,610 --> 01:54:20,550
it's the fucking hat man.
That God damn polarizing,

2900
01:54:20,551 --> 01:54:22,500
stupid hate that had so much.
Look at these,

2901
01:54:22,520 --> 01:54:25,380
even closer to him,
he's put the drum off to the side so we

2902
01:54:25,381 --> 01:54:30,030
can get closer to this kid's face music.
Expecting the kid to walk away.

2903
01:54:30,031 --> 01:54:32,910
I don't know,
but the kid doesn't do anything but

2904
01:54:32,911 --> 01:54:36,600
silly is blinking because the,
the beating of the drum is so close to

2905
01:54:36,601 --> 01:54:39,430
his eyes.
It's weird.

2906
01:54:39,490 --> 01:54:40,323
Yeah.

2907
01:54:41,110 --> 01:54:41,900
Okay.

2908
01:54:41,900 --> 01:54:45,710
The whole thing is very weird.
So weird staring that kid down.

2909
01:54:46,100 --> 01:54:48,380
I mean,
why wouldn't you walk away just to

2910
01:54:48,381 --> 01:54:50,960
define why we don't know everyone else
walked away.

2911
01:54:50,990 --> 01:54:53,360
But what does he have to,
doesn't have to be standing there and

2912
01:54:53,361 --> 01:54:56,360
the guy decides to get in his face.
I think you would walk away.

2913
01:54:56,420 --> 01:55:00,800
Probably the killer that on me,
I would,

2914
01:55:00,890 --> 01:55:03,170
I would definitely move.
I think I would probably move to,

2915
01:55:03,171 --> 01:55:05,390
because I'd be scared if that guy got in
my face.

2916
01:55:05,391 --> 01:55:06,860
I've done,
I think that guy's going to hit me.

2917
01:55:07,490 --> 01:55:08,960
I would think something's gonna go
wrong.

2918
01:55:09,030 --> 01:55:09,730
I'm like,
this is good.

2919
01:55:09,730 --> 01:55:13,130
This is just too weird.
But it's not the kids.

2920
01:55:13,131 --> 01:55:17,090
He's 16 yeah.
I the grownups fall for getting an a 16

2921
01:55:17,091 --> 01:55:18,860
year old kid's face beating a drum.
Yeah.

2922
01:55:19,340 --> 01:55:23,030
I look at it and I,
it's that fucking hat man.

2923
01:55:23,080 --> 01:55:23,970
I mean,
what's also the,

2924
01:55:24,060 --> 01:55:26,720
he,
the native American man rightly felt

2925
01:55:26,721 --> 01:55:28,090
like he was being mocked.
Yeah.

2926
01:55:28,130 --> 01:55:33,020
And then his traditions and his,
his heritage is being mocked and these

2927
01:55:33,021 --> 01:55:33,801
little kids.
Yeah.

2928
01:55:33,801 --> 01:55:35,570
I mean,
I don't think he had the right to walk

2929
01:55:35,571 --> 01:55:37,000
up on the kid like that,
but it's like where,

2930
01:55:37,001 --> 01:55:38,390
where is your breaking point?
Well,

2931
01:55:38,391 --> 01:55:39,140
wait a minute.
Dot.

2932
01:55:39,140 --> 01:55:43,440
I don't think he doesn't have the right,
but this is where confrontation from,

2933
01:55:43,441 --> 01:55:45,090
do you have the right to make
confrontation?

2934
01:55:45,120 --> 01:55:45,660
Yep.
Maybe,

2935
01:55:45,660 --> 01:55:46,680
perhaps may,
perhaps,

2936
01:55:46,770 --> 01:55:49,500
but that's not really the best way to
communicate.

2937
01:55:49,530 --> 01:55:51,840
You're singing a song,
a native American song,

2938
01:55:51,841 --> 01:55:54,690
and he doesn't know what the fuck you're
singing and you're doing it inches from

2939
01:55:54,691 --> 01:55:55,600
his face.
Yeah.

2940
01:55:55,980 --> 01:55:58,800
And everyone's feeling,
it's a really a sign of the Times that

2941
01:55:58,980 --> 01:56:01,110
people took clips of that and they made
it out.

2942
01:56:01,111 --> 01:56:04,590
Like this little kids that can't and
even raise a offline had on is if you

2943
01:56:04,591 --> 01:56:06,570
ever seen a more punchable face like,
man,

2944
01:56:07,010 --> 01:56:09,210
it's your,
you're calling for violence on a kid.

2945
01:56:09,211 --> 01:56:10,044
Is that what you're doing?

2946
01:56:10,080 --> 01:56:10,830
It's,
it's,

2947
01:56:10,830 --> 01:56:12,180
it's the same,
uh,

2948
01:56:12,470 --> 01:56:13,890
you know,
level of,

2949
01:56:13,950 --> 01:56:15,300
and again,
you know,

2950
01:56:15,450 --> 01:56:17,340
as kids,
like even when you were pulling that

2951
01:56:17,341 --> 01:56:19,650
clip up,
I could feel my stomach make a fist and

2952
01:56:19,651 --> 01:56:20,101
I'm like,
oh,

2953
01:56:20,101 --> 01:56:21,330
there's just,
I don't want to see this.

2954
01:56:21,331 --> 01:56:23,730
But you know,
uh,

2955
01:56:23,910 --> 01:56:27,340
like it,
it's like that dude that,

2956
01:56:27,350 --> 01:56:28,830
that his,
that,

2957
01:56:28,831 --> 01:56:31,050
that kid at the cub game who had the
game in his,

2958
01:56:31,080 --> 01:56:34,740
in his earphones and he caught the ball,
which the outfielder was definitely not

2959
01:56:34,741 --> 01:56:37,790
going to catch anyway.
And they blamed him for the cubs loss of

2960
01:56:37,791 --> 01:56:39,480
the series and they had to squirt that
kid out.

2961
01:56:40,050 --> 01:56:42,000
And I thought the kid reached forward
though.

2962
01:56:42,120 --> 01:56:43,110
He did.
But I,

2963
01:56:43,111 --> 01:56:46,110
if you look at the tape,
I don't think that the outfield or had

2964
01:56:46,111 --> 01:56:48,510
it now fit her was pointing like you
fucked up kid.

2965
01:56:48,511 --> 01:56:50,220
Like you ruined it.
And it was kind of this,

2966
01:56:50,400 --> 01:56:52,560
why understand when you're playing major
league ball,

2967
01:56:52,590 --> 01:56:54,430
one mistake could mean the end of your
career,

2968
01:56:54,431 --> 01:56:54,510
right?

2969
01:56:54,510 --> 01:56:55,800
Your family's I man,
when I saw,

2970
01:56:55,801 --> 01:56:57,150
I think that's different.
When I saw that,

2971
01:56:57,151 --> 01:56:58,800
I thought that kid fucked up the game

2972
01:56:59,550 --> 01:57:01,410
there.
It could be argued.

2973
01:57:01,411 --> 01:57:02,460
Yes.
You know what I'm talking about this a

2974
01:57:02,461 --> 01:57:02,821
little.
Yeah,

2975
01:57:02,821 --> 01:57:05,940
but that's like you're staying there
with blaming one tiny play on the entire

2976
01:57:05,941 --> 01:57:08,400
game and you can't do that.
The fact,

2977
01:57:08,401 --> 01:57:11,130
the fact that back to what your point of
punched the kid in the face,

2978
01:57:11,430 --> 01:57:14,790
that kid had to be escorted out of
Wrigley field because people were going

2979
01:57:14,791 --> 01:57:16,830
to kill him.
They were drunk people that we're going

2980
01:57:16,831 --> 01:57:17,820
to throw hit that kid in

2981
01:57:17,960 --> 01:57:20,240
traffic.
Can we see that video of the guy

2982
01:57:20,360 --> 01:57:23,630
catching the ball?
I think that kid actually did fuck up

2983
01:57:23,631 --> 01:57:25,580
that game.
I think the difference is that kid

2984
01:57:25,950 --> 01:57:30,770
reached into the playing field.
What he did was definitely wrong and

2985
01:57:30,850 --> 01:57:32,820
illegal and let's see and everything,
but yeah,

2986
01:57:32,821 --> 01:57:34,080
let's check it out.
Tail the tape.

2987
01:57:35,980 --> 01:57:38,060
Steve,
here's the ball.

2988
01:57:38,420 --> 01:57:39,620
It's going.
It's going.

2989
01:57:39,650 --> 01:57:43,340
It's going.
Wait a minute.

2990
01:57:44,180 --> 01:57:46,600
Let me say one more time back that up.
No,

2991
01:57:46,640 --> 01:57:46,791
no,
no,

2992
01:57:46,791 --> 01:57:49,060
but just back it up.
Okay.

2993
01:57:55,600 --> 01:57:56,460
I mean,
I,

2994
01:57:56,600 --> 01:57:59,170
I think I take it back.
I had,

2995
01:57:59,200 --> 01:58:00,380
I had,
uh,

2996
01:58:00,550 --> 01:58:04,390
I think they one more time,
I think I remembered it wrong.

2997
01:58:05,350 --> 01:58:06,370
Oh yeah.
They stole it.

2998
01:58:06,371 --> 01:58:07,390
They stole it from him.
Fuck.

2999
01:58:07,391 --> 01:58:09,430
I'd seen it take it all back.
He had the ball.

3000
01:58:09,460 --> 01:58:10,960
I take it all back.
That kid fucked it up.

3001
01:58:10,990 --> 01:58:13,360
Yeah,
he literally did.

3002
01:58:13,390 --> 01:58:15,910
He took it.
He literally took it from him in the

3003
01:58:15,911 --> 01:58:17,890
playing field.
Yeah,

3004
01:58:17,891 --> 01:58:19,830
you little cunt.
Oh,

3005
01:58:20,980 --> 01:58:24,670
he's got spray on on people.
Probably through beers on them probably,

3006
01:58:24,760 --> 01:58:25,650
but,
but,

3007
01:58:25,820 --> 01:58:28,390
but it's that thing of like threatening
a kid's life.

3008
01:58:28,420 --> 01:58:31,090
That's crazy.
But also it's like if you're a kid and

3009
01:58:31,091 --> 01:58:34,030
the ball's right there,
you're going to reach for it.

3010
01:58:34,031 --> 01:58:36,400
You're not going to be thinking this
guy's going to catch her,

3011
01:58:36,401 --> 01:58:38,770
not going to catch it.
It's like you have the chance to catch

3012
01:58:38,771 --> 01:58:40,270
the ball.
It's right there.

3013
01:58:40,300 --> 01:58:41,680
Yeah.
You're to catch it.

3014
01:58:41,681 --> 01:58:43,660
Yeah.
Did you see that clip

3015
01:58:43,690 --> 01:58:46,900
from a letterman like from like,
I don't know,

3016
01:58:46,901 --> 01:58:49,180
30 years ago or something and he just,
there was a,

3017
01:58:49,181 --> 01:58:51,580
it was like the lineup was this famous
person,

3018
01:58:51,581 --> 01:58:53,250
this famous person.
Then just Aramco,

3019
01:58:53,260 --> 01:58:54,011
like a name.
You're like,

3020
01:58:54,011 --> 01:58:56,320
who?
And he brought this guy out and it was

3021
01:58:56,321 --> 01:58:58,720
like a middle aged guy and a ball cap
and he's like,

3022
01:58:59,050 --> 01:58:59,501
let him,
he's like,

3023
01:58:59,501 --> 01:59:00,334
you know,
I just,

3024
01:59:00,580 --> 01:59:02,230
I think you're the greatest living
American.

3025
01:59:02,290 --> 01:59:03,220
And the guy's like,
oh,

3026
01:59:03,221 --> 01:59:04,180
well I,
and he's like,

3027
01:59:04,600 --> 01:59:08,320
roll the tape.
And they show just like that home run

3028
01:59:08,470 --> 01:59:09,460
and it's going,
it's going,

3029
01:59:09,461 --> 01:59:12,760
it's going and this guy has just has a
beer and he's not looking and that

3030
01:59:12,761 --> 01:59:13,690
you're here.
The announcer go,

3031
01:59:13,720 --> 01:59:15,580
oh my God.
And the ball hits the beer.

3032
01:59:15,581 --> 01:59:16,340
And the guy's like,
fuck.

3033
01:59:16,340 --> 01:59:17,140
He gets hit.
And he's like,

3034
01:59:17,140 --> 01:59:17,973
Oh shit,
buff.

3035
01:59:18,460 --> 01:59:20,470
And everyone's kind of laughing at him.
He was like a home run,

3036
01:59:20,500 --> 01:59:22,810
there goes my beer.
And then endings later,

3037
01:59:24,010 --> 01:59:26,200
same line,
same run,

3038
01:59:26,320 --> 01:59:29,710
same guy.
And the announcer goes,

3039
01:59:29,711 --> 01:59:33,480
you have got to be kidding.
And the ball just hits the same guy like

3040
01:59:33,520 --> 01:59:33,920
again,

3041
01:59:33,920 --> 01:59:34,910
like twice,
same game,

3042
01:59:36,030 --> 01:59:38,690
but it let them and had him on and it
was,

3043
01:59:38,780 --> 01:59:39,710
it was like,
you know,

3044
01:59:39,711 --> 01:59:41,820
minor league or something like that.
Like you'd never would,

3045
01:59:41,860 --> 01:59:44,510
it wouldn't be unlike the nightly news,
but it was just like,

3046
01:59:44,690 --> 01:59:47,660
what are the fucking Huh?
How many people have ever been hit in

3047
01:59:47,661 --> 01:59:51,230
the head by a line drive that would fuck
you up?

3048
01:59:51,260 --> 01:59:54,500
That would hurt.
Like you'd be solely never be the same

3049
01:59:54,501 --> 01:59:54,870
again.

3050
01:59:54,870 --> 01:59:55,703
No.

3051
01:59:56,740 --> 02:00:00,730
Because when I was a kid,
Tony Conigliaro in Boston during the,

3052
02:00:00,740 --> 02:00:01,830
the,
the Red Sox,

3053
02:00:01,831 --> 02:00:03,930
he was actually like,
I was very young at the time.

3054
02:00:03,931 --> 02:00:07,020
Might actually have happened before I
lived there.

3055
02:00:07,021 --> 02:00:08,880
But it was like the store that everybody
always told,

3056
02:00:09,090 --> 02:00:12,570
he got hit in the head with a pitch and
he was never the same again.

3057
02:00:12,660 --> 02:00:15,460
And it was one of the reasons why they
started wearing padding helmets.

3058
02:00:15,610 --> 02:00:17,700
Yeah.
There was a kid who got hit in the chest

3059
02:00:17,701 --> 02:00:20,400
and his heart stopped.
Oh yeah.

3060
02:00:20,401 --> 02:00:22,140
Cause that,
that doesn't happen that often,

3061
02:00:22,170 --> 02:00:24,840
but it just,
it just makes your heart just go whoop.

3062
02:00:24,900 --> 02:00:26,820
It just knocks it out.
Oh Jesus.

3063
02:00:27,740 --> 02:00:29,790
Fuck.
It's a rock covered with leather,

3064
02:00:30,610 --> 02:00:32,190
you know.
I mean,

3065
02:00:32,191 --> 02:00:35,040
you feel a hardball.
That fucking thing is dense.

3066
02:00:35,060 --> 02:00:36,140
Uh Huh.
Yeah.

3067
02:00:36,210 --> 02:00:38,550
I mean soccer was originally kicking a
head around,

3068
02:00:38,880 --> 02:00:41,520
but that's what an Aztec culture.

3069
02:00:41,900 --> 02:00:43,800
Um,
they wouldn't like,

3070
02:00:43,801 --> 02:00:46,200
it was after like a battle.
They just take ahead and kick it around.

3071
02:00:46,260 --> 02:00:48,990
And that was like where the game is,
how we're soccer came from what,

3072
02:00:48,991 --> 02:00:49,980
from what I've read.
Yeah.

3073
02:00:50,460 --> 02:00:53,580
I knew they had some weird mind game
where they,

3074
02:00:53,750 --> 02:00:56,010
they played football and Mayan.
That's I'm thinking.

3075
02:00:56,040 --> 02:00:56,550
Oh,
okay.

3076
02:00:56,550 --> 02:00:58,590
Yeah,
and I think that they decided,

3077
02:00:59,100 --> 02:01:04,100
they used to think that they played and
then the winner sacrificed the losing

3078
02:01:04,291 --> 02:01:09,240
team and now there was also some
speculation that it could have been the

3079
02:01:09,241 --> 02:01:14,040
opposite that the winning team was
sacrificed was just like,

3080
02:01:14,041 --> 02:01:16,080
but I'm going to be in the fucking
slowest game ever.

3081
02:01:17,710 --> 02:01:19,740
Oops.
All got by me.

3082
02:01:20,160 --> 02:01:21,900
You know,
you scored again,

3083
02:01:21,960 --> 02:01:26,960
but the idea was that you would play
with such courage knowing that you were

3084
02:01:27,001 --> 02:01:29,280
going to win and then you're going to
get killed,

3085
02:01:29,400 --> 02:01:31,710
but you still want it to when it's,
yeah,

3086
02:01:33,250 --> 02:01:36,950
the level of honor that it was had to be
like so high and they are like,

3087
02:01:37,180 --> 02:01:39,470
my,
my family will never want for anything

3088
02:01:39,471 --> 02:01:40,700
ever again,
so I'm just going to,

3089
02:01:40,790 --> 02:01:42,730
or the level of drugs.
Yeah.

3090
02:01:42,860 --> 02:01:45,710
You were taking to pull the belief.
It's like,

3091
02:01:45,711 --> 02:01:48,320
you know,
assassin comes from [inaudible],

3092
02:01:48,500 --> 02:01:50,660
you know where this guy would just,
yeah.

3093
02:01:50,780 --> 02:01:53,900
Is this guy in in a,
what we call the Middle East basically.

3094
02:01:54,350 --> 02:01:56,240
He was like,
how do you kill a King?

3095
02:01:56,330 --> 02:02:00,260
You got to get an assassin who doesn't
care if he dies and so high on hash,

3096
02:02:00,290 --> 02:02:04,850
he built a of a family garden of
delights where he had naked women just

3097
02:02:04,851 --> 02:02:08,020
hanging around like prostitutes and like
flowing waterfalls.

3098
02:02:08,060 --> 02:02:11,060
And he would just get a peasant and
smoke them up so much.

3099
02:02:11,061 --> 02:02:12,530
And he's like,
do you want to see heaven?

3100
02:02:12,560 --> 02:02:13,490
And you'd be like,
yeah.

3101
02:02:13,491 --> 02:02:14,720
And he'd take them in the room and be
like,

3102
02:02:14,960 --> 02:02:16,370
check it out.
And he's like,

3103
02:02:16,371 --> 02:02:20,780
I have the door to heaven and if you
kill the Saltin and the town's Square

3104
02:02:20,781 --> 02:02:22,070
tomorrow,
you're here.

3105
02:02:22,610 --> 02:02:26,030
And so a guy would just run up and stab
this guy to death and the guard would

3106
02:02:26,031 --> 02:02:28,400
murder him.
But that was how you get a guy,

3107
02:02:28,401 --> 02:02:31,700
you trick a person.
So it's kind of like a,

3108
02:02:31,701 --> 02:02:33,590
it's the same,
probably the same thing where that level

3109
02:02:33,591 --> 02:02:35,120
of drugs where you're like,
if I,

3110
02:02:35,121 --> 02:02:39,560
when they cut my head off but I go to
vall Holla or whatever their version of

3111
02:02:39,561 --> 02:02:40,100
having is,

3112
02:02:40,100 --> 02:02:42,680
well,
human sacrifices always such a strange

3113
02:02:42,681 --> 02:02:46,760
thing.
You idea of getting like a living life

3114
02:02:46,820 --> 02:02:50,810
to the gods.
This was a such a common thing.

3115
02:02:50,960 --> 02:02:51,793
Yeah.
Yeah.

3116
02:02:52,720 --> 02:02:54,860
Kill people.
It's common.

3117
02:02:55,510 --> 02:02:57,460
It's like going to the game.
Are you gonna go,

3118
02:02:57,490 --> 02:02:59,200
you're gonna go watch that guy.
Get his heart torn out.

3119
02:02:59,560 --> 02:03:00,790
Yeah,
I'm taking my kid,

3120
02:03:01,390 --> 02:03:03,040
get some popcorn.
Couple of bud lights.

3121
02:03:03,040 --> 02:03:03,640
It's

3122
02:03:03,640 --> 02:03:04,840
um,
I was reading,

3123
02:03:04,841 --> 02:03:06,430
um,
that a book,

3124
02:03:06,460 --> 02:03:08,040
uh,
uh,

3125
02:03:08,910 --> 02:03:11,040
not primate.
What is it called?

3126
02:03:11,170 --> 02:03:13,240
Simeon's sapiens.
Sapiens,

3127
02:03:13,480 --> 02:03:16,120
sapiens.
And there there's um,

3128
02:03:16,840 --> 02:03:20,050
uh,
there's a story about certain cultures

3129
02:03:20,051 --> 02:03:22,810
that were,
would kill like the older people,

3130
02:03:23,230 --> 02:03:24,510
they would kill like,
uh,

3131
02:03:24,570 --> 02:03:26,590
oh.
And this guy who had killed a few of his

3132
02:03:26,591 --> 02:03:30,040
aunts and all the old women were
terrified of him cause he would sneak up

3133
02:03:30,041 --> 02:03:33,280
behind them when they got too old
because they were,

3134
02:03:33,310 --> 02:03:36,100
you know,
there are gaps in Aladdin people and he

3135
02:03:36,101 --> 02:03:39,910
would hit him with an ax and they are
talking to these people and I'm like,

3136
02:03:39,911 --> 02:03:42,250
Jesus Christ,
imagine you got to kill your aunt with

3137
02:03:42,251 --> 02:03:43,200
an ax.
Well,

3138
02:03:43,201 --> 02:03:46,030
it imagine getting to a certain,
like your birthday party and blow out

3139
02:03:46,031 --> 02:03:47,770
the candles.
And he was just spin around it.

3140
02:03:47,771 --> 02:03:49,030
Fuck off.
Get away from me.

3141
02:03:51,150 --> 02:03:53,470
Yeah.
One of the craziest stories that I ever

3142
02:03:53,471 --> 02:03:56,380
heard was during the temple,
I think you say it too,

3143
02:03:56,381 --> 02:03:57,890
to con the,
uh,

3144
02:03:57,930 --> 02:04:01,840
one of the large Aztec temples when they
completed the temple,

3145
02:04:01,841 --> 02:04:06,841
they sacrificed something like 80,000
people over the course of two days.

3146
02:04:08,770 --> 02:04:10,060
Yeah.
But pull,

3147
02:04:10,061 --> 02:04:12,280
pull that up.
Temple of to ICAN.

3148
02:04:12,490 --> 02:04:13,510
I think it's,
um,

3149
02:04:13,810 --> 02:04:18,100
outside of Mexico City.
And when the aztecs constructed this,

3150
02:04:18,130 --> 02:04:22,540
when it was finally completed,
they essentially sacrificed all the

3151
02:04:22,541 --> 02:04:25,660
slaves that were used to build.
Oh my God.

3152
02:04:25,810 --> 02:04:28,990
Yeah.
So they just covered this fucking

3153
02:04:29,380 --> 02:04:34,380
gigantic temple with blood of 80,000
people that they butchered on the spot.

3154
02:04:35,410 --> 02:04:36,520
Yeah.
Oh God.

3155
02:04:36,730 --> 02:04:39,570
Over today's days to kill everybody.
That's a lot.

3156
02:04:39,600 --> 02:04:41,880
That's a lot of butchering.
That's a lot of murder.

3157
02:04:42,360 --> 02:04:43,193
That's,
that's,

3158
02:04:43,200 --> 02:04:45,360
that's,
that's exhausting levels of,

3159
02:04:46,110 --> 02:04:48,500
it's so much to the,
I had told a friend this story and he

3160
02:04:48,501 --> 02:04:49,410
was like,
that's not true.

3161
02:04:49,570 --> 02:04:50,311
I'm like,
I'm telling you,

3162
02:04:50,311 --> 02:04:51,270
it's true.
Why would I lie?

3163
02:04:51,330 --> 02:04:53,080
He's one of those guys doing the math.
I had to,

3164
02:04:53,081 --> 02:04:54,770
I had to,
we had to get to a place where their

3165
02:04:54,780 --> 02:04:56,580
service and Google it.
Yeah.

3166
02:04:56,890 --> 02:04:58,620
It's,
it's just daunting.

3167
02:04:59,120 --> 02:05:02,910
80,000 people and these are the very
people that built the thing,

3168
02:05:03,220 --> 02:05:06,180
which I mean that was the way,
that's what they do.

3169
02:05:06,260 --> 02:05:07,093
Oh,
we're done.

3170
02:05:07,330 --> 02:05:08,450
All right.
Kill Them.

3171
02:05:08,640 --> 02:05:11,400
Well that was one of the weirder things
about,

3172
02:05:11,420 --> 02:05:13,380
uh,
going to cheech an Eatsa was there was

3173
02:05:13,381 --> 02:05:16,920
this one platform that was just designed
for sacrifice.

3174
02:05:17,120 --> 02:05:18,840
Wow.
Would kill people on this platform.

3175
02:05:18,841 --> 02:05:20,970
And it's like,
it was set up like a bench.

3176
02:05:20,971 --> 02:05:24,540
Like there's legs and the head,
like someone was holding this bench and

3177
02:05:24,541 --> 02:05:27,540
place,
they would just chop a head off and it

3178
02:05:27,541 --> 02:05:30,690
rolled down the fucking stairs.
Probably like a little,

3179
02:05:31,070 --> 02:05:32,880
a little hedge slide kind of thing.

3180
02:05:32,880 --> 02:05:35,580
What do you think the fascination with
that is?

3181
02:05:35,581 --> 02:05:39,120
Like this,
this idea of killing someone to appease

3182
02:05:39,121 --> 02:05:41,310
the gods.
And it was it because everyone was

3183
02:05:41,311 --> 02:05:43,620
afraid to die.
So that when you could force someone to

3184
02:05:43,621 --> 02:05:46,110
do it in front of everyone,
just for someone to die in front of

3185
02:05:46,111 --> 02:05:48,120
everyone and sacrifice them,
they would just,

3186
02:05:48,350 --> 02:05:51,930
it would long as it was like there was
enough distance between you and them,

3187
02:05:51,931 --> 02:05:55,800
they'll would be this charge of
excitement and very machiavellian for

3188
02:05:55,801 --> 02:05:56,520
sure.
Uh,

3189
02:05:56,520 --> 02:05:57,480
it's,
it's,

3190
02:05:57,620 --> 02:05:59,970
you know,
power perceived as power achieved.

3191
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:03,120
If you see anyone can die and fall in
line real fast.

3192
02:06:03,480 --> 02:06:08,310
And I think it's also the,
the incorrect unpredictability of life

3193
02:06:08,311 --> 02:06:09,440
itself.
So it's like,

3194
02:06:09,450 --> 02:06:12,360
hey look,
we're going to kill 80 people but we're

3195
02:06:12,361 --> 02:06:15,060
going to have no,
no storms for the next couple of months.

3196
02:06:15,260 --> 02:06:17,190
Like it's no one I know.
Yeah.

3197
02:06:17,191 --> 02:06:17,910
Fuck them.

3198
02:06:17,910 --> 02:06:22,080
Especially if you have some like elder
who like some Shaman who tells you that

3199
02:06:22,081 --> 02:06:23,880
this is the only way we're going to stop
the storms.

3200
02:06:23,881 --> 02:06:24,880
Yeah,
yeah,

3201
02:06:24,950 --> 02:06:26,520
yeah.
People believe the fucking anything.

3202
02:06:26,521 --> 02:06:28,230
Did you get to template to have finally
found it?

3203
02:06:28,231 --> 02:06:29,820
It says somewhere between,
uh,

3204
02:06:30,040 --> 02:06:32,970
there's a recorded article in 2011 post
story today,

3205
02:06:33,270 --> 02:06:36,360
84,000 people,
but it says this is a disputed number.

3206
02:06:36,470 --> 02:06:39,480
It could be a down the 4,000,
maybe the numbers disputed.

3207
02:06:39,481 --> 02:06:41,130
However,
some say as few as 4,000 were

3208
02:06:41,131 --> 02:06:45,270
sacrificed.
And what was actually a re consecration

3209
02:06:45,300 --> 02:06:49,230
of the Templo Mayor Corp in 1487,
nevertheless,

3210
02:06:49,231 --> 02:06:51,930
scores were killed cheese.
Um hmm.

3211
02:06:51,960 --> 02:06:56,960
So the one thought is 1487 the aztecs
recorded that 84,000 people were

3212
02:06:57,871 --> 02:07:00,930
slaughtered in four days.
Self sacrifice was common in

3213
02:07:00,931 --> 02:07:02,760
individuals,
would pierce the owners,

3214
02:07:02,761 --> 02:07:06,510
tongues and genitals to nourish the
floors of the temples with their blood.

3215
02:07:06,870 --> 02:07:09,180
And surprisingly,
there is evidence that Mexico was

3216
02:07:09,181 --> 02:07:13,470
already suffering from a demographic
crisis before the Spanish arrived.

3217
02:07:14,280 --> 02:07:15,750
You,
the Spanish probably came in at the

3218
02:07:15,751 --> 02:07:18,930
perfect time.
This is how you said the Great Pyramid

3219
02:07:18,931 --> 02:07:23,931
of t note Che Che
[inaudible], [inaudible] La is that I

3220
02:07:25,440 --> 02:07:29,100
say it,
that seems a phonetic,

3221
02:07:29,700 --> 02:07:31,960
that seems like I've seen that
vertically.

3222
02:07:32,620 --> 02:07:33,990
Alon.
To know,

3223
02:07:34,200 --> 02:07:35,340
to know Chit Lawn,

3224
02:07:37,210 --> 02:07:39,420
to know Chit Lawn.
Does it tell you Jose,

3225
02:07:40,870 --> 02:07:42,280
me,
Whoa,

3226
02:07:42,350 --> 02:07:46,300
cool.
10.

3227
02:07:46,340 --> 02:07:51,340
No Mexican pronunciation of say no
to know chip blonde.

3228
02:07:53,350 --> 02:07:54,500
Yeah.
I think that's right on.

3229
02:07:54,820 --> 02:07:56,350
Yeah.
Come up with better names bro.

3230
02:07:58,390 --> 02:07:59,620
Yeah.
Anyway,

3231
02:07:59,740 --> 02:08:02,350
a lot of people,
Jesus also said those games that they

3232
02:08:02,351 --> 02:08:03,650
were playing were,
uh,

3233
02:08:04,360 --> 02:08:06,640
that people already take capitated.
They might've been rigged.

3234
02:08:06,760 --> 02:08:08,370
They weren't sure if they were rigged,
but they might've,

3235
02:08:08,380 --> 02:08:10,810
how'd Roosevelt and faked or games to,
oops,

3236
02:08:10,811 --> 02:08:13,540
I lost it.
Died people like better.

3237
02:08:13,870 --> 02:08:15,250
They're more fun.
Those guys.

3238
02:08:16,180 --> 02:08:18,290
Yeah.
These guys you want around,

3239
02:08:18,410 --> 02:08:19,540
you got to sell tickets.
I mean,

3240
02:08:20,920 --> 02:08:22,750
we kill those guys.
We blow,

3241
02:08:22,760 --> 02:08:24,550
you know,
we've got no one to stadium next week.

3242
02:08:24,551 --> 02:08:28,180
The whole game.
It is weird that all cultures agree

3243
02:08:28,390 --> 02:08:29,280
that,
um,

3244
02:08:29,380 --> 02:08:32,770
one of the best ways to appease the
masses to have these large sporting

3245
02:08:32,771 --> 02:08:37,270
events or people gather around to watch
this mock warfare take place.

3246
02:08:37,270 --> 02:08:38,140
Yeah.
Yeah.

3247
02:08:38,380 --> 02:08:39,760
Uh,
like how the,

3248
02:08:39,910 --> 02:08:43,090
the,
when when Shaka Zulu came in,

3249
02:08:43,120 --> 02:08:45,700
they were just fighting like mock wars
and they were just like,

3250
02:08:45,910 --> 02:08:47,150
with fake,
you know,

3251
02:08:47,380 --> 02:08:51,610
swords and spears and he just ran out
and started stabbing people and they're

3252
02:08:51,611 --> 02:08:52,600
like,
what are you doing?

3253
02:08:52,900 --> 02:08:54,040
And he's like,
I'm trying to win.

3254
02:08:54,670 --> 02:08:55,990
Yeah.
It doesn't work that way,

3255
02:08:55,991 --> 02:08:57,010
Bro.
Trying to fake it.

3256
02:08:57,150 --> 02:08:58,450
Yeah.
Yeah.

3257
02:08:58,460 --> 02:09:03,130
Like if,
if we escalated past like football and

3258
02:09:03,131 --> 02:09:06,130
football,
like something way more violent came

3259
02:09:06,131 --> 02:09:10,840
along,
but not quite war like duels.

3260
02:09:11,080 --> 02:09:12,700
Jesus.
I know.

3261
02:09:12,730 --> 02:09:14,500
It's like I'm,
I'm,

3262
02:09:14,680 --> 02:09:18,730
I'm glad we're not there as much as I
have my problems with like concussions

3263
02:09:18,731 --> 02:09:21,790
and football and stuff and it's just,
just,

3264
02:09:21,791 --> 02:09:22,960
yeah,
I guess that's a good,

3265
02:09:23,020 --> 02:09:23,853
like what,
what's,

3266
02:09:24,100 --> 02:09:28,060
what be the next thing you can kind of
get away with playing football if you

3267
02:09:28,061 --> 02:09:29,470
get out early enough.
Yeah.

3268
02:09:30,160 --> 02:09:33,160
But even they,
they're saying that even kids in high

3269
02:09:33,161 --> 02:09:34,750
school have cte.
Yeah.

3270
02:09:35,620 --> 02:09:37,150
Yeah.
It's brutal.

3271
02:09:38,230 --> 02:09:41,590
Do you see what they do in Russia where
they have those a five on five mma

3272
02:09:41,591 --> 02:09:43,390
fights?
They have gang fights.

3273
02:09:43,420 --> 02:09:44,910
They meet on football fields.
Yes.

3274
02:09:46,210 --> 02:09:48,950
Russians are always taking it through
the night so that when you put up in,

3275
02:09:49,070 --> 02:09:52,000
uh,
it's like somewhere in eastern Europe

3276
02:09:52,001 --> 02:09:54,220
and it's just one big like bald bull
looking guy.

3277
02:09:54,221 --> 02:09:55,840
Fight like five guys.
Oh yeah,

3278
02:09:55,841 --> 02:09:56,674
yeah,
yeah,

3279
02:09:56,830 --> 02:09:58,930
yeah.
I think that's Russian to good Lord.

3280
02:09:58,960 --> 02:10:00,730
Yeah.
These couple of guys decided to try and

3281
02:10:00,731 --> 02:10:01,990
take on a giant.
Yeah,

3282
02:10:02,020 --> 02:10:04,240
that guy was a giant.
That guy was like a dude that like

3283
02:10:04,241 --> 02:10:08,080
breaks rocks and like fi fi fo fum.
I smell the blood of an Englishman.

3284
02:10:08,500 --> 02:10:12,880
Fi Fi fo fum.
That's the kids even learned that story

3285
02:10:12,881 --> 02:10:14,950
anymore.
The fee fi fo fum.

3286
02:10:16,330 --> 02:10:18,700
Once they write some new ones,
why are we telling these old ass

3287
02:10:18,701 --> 02:10:19,534
stories?
Yeah,

3288
02:10:19,660 --> 02:10:21,070
I love it.
You see that movie about the,

3289
02:10:21,071 --> 02:10:21,904
uh,
about the,

3290
02:10:22,040 --> 02:10:24,130
uh,
troll hunter where that guy like goes

3291
02:10:24,131 --> 02:10:27,840
out into like the,
the end of Scandinavia and he's hot.

3292
02:10:27,870 --> 02:10:30,090
He hunted trolls and there's actual
giant monster trolls.

3293
02:10:30,120 --> 02:10:31,540
Oh yeah.
Remember that movie?

3294
02:10:31,541 --> 02:10:32,890
That was a fun,
stupid move.

3295
02:10:32,891 --> 02:10:33,711
It was fun.
And I,

3296
02:10:33,711 --> 02:10:35,330
one thing I loved about it was it was
just like,

3297
02:10:35,480 --> 02:10:38,390
are any of you are Christian?
Tell me right now,

3298
02:10:38,660 --> 02:10:39,830
right now.
And they're like,

3299
02:10:39,831 --> 02:10:41,450
no.
And there's one guy would like secretly

3300
02:10:41,451 --> 02:10:45,050
was and the troll could smell his blood
cause I think I smell the blood of an

3301
02:10:45,051 --> 02:10:45,770
Englishman.
I was like,

3302
02:10:45,770 --> 02:10:47,600
wow,
that's such an awesome angle.

3303
02:10:47,960 --> 02:10:50,880
Oh Wow.
It's just like that's cause he's,

3304
02:10:50,960 --> 02:10:52,490
he's like,
he's like a scientist.

3305
02:10:52,491 --> 02:10:54,530
He's like,
I know what these guys are after.

3306
02:10:54,531 --> 02:10:57,710
They want to chew up Christian people.
See if you can find,

3307
02:10:57,711 --> 02:11:01,310
find that clip for the trailer for
trollhunter cause it's so stupid.

3308
02:11:01,330 --> 02:11:03,530
It's so,
it's a good movie to get high and watch.

3309
02:11:03,710 --> 02:11:05,480
Yeah.
Well I love stuff that's like,

3310
02:11:05,481 --> 02:11:07,670
there's a giant thing in the distance
like coming.

3311
02:11:08,110 --> 02:11:09,080
That's how I,
that's a big thing.

3312
02:11:09,130 --> 02:11:12,170
If I'm high where I'm just like,
what if King Kong just came from behind

3313
02:11:12,171 --> 02:11:14,420
that building right now?
Yeah.

3314
02:11:14,490 --> 02:11:18,350
He's a volume.
Sometimes you get to see unique film.

3315
02:11:21,140 --> 02:11:23,890
Imagine they really wore trolls.
Just

3316
02:11:25,500 --> 02:11:29,250
he's just eating goats crawling up on
something

3317
02:11:31,670 --> 02:11:32,990
gay.
A foreign film.

3318
02:11:33,500 --> 02:11:34,050
Yeah.
It's,

3319
02:11:34,050 --> 02:11:35,850
it's somewhere in skin and like

3320
02:11:36,220 --> 02:11:37,840
Norway all day.
Come on.

3321
02:11:38,260 --> 02:11:43,260
Know
Micro Flora.

3322
02:11:46,300 --> 02:11:47,770
Well that's a lot of people think it
says,

3323
02:11:47,771 --> 02:11:50,860
do you think Michael Moore gave up after
the first trial documentary?

3324
02:11:50,870 --> 02:11:52,480
Like real?
Yeah,

3325
02:11:52,481 --> 02:11:54,610
exactly.
They're doing like a Blair witch project

3326
02:11:54,611 --> 02:11:55,600
thing,
but with trolls.

3327
02:11:55,620 --> 02:11:56,960
Yeah.
Yeah.

3328
02:11:56,970 --> 02:11:59,200
We'd get,
give me a little distance in this.

3329
02:11:59,201 --> 02:12:02,350
I'm tired of seeing this buildup.
I want to see the fucking troll.

3330
02:12:03,610 --> 02:12:08,610
This showed the trailer out for sure.
They don't shift wreck.

3331
02:12:09,040 --> 02:12:10,750
I'm Christian.
I love that

3332
02:12:15,400 --> 02:12:20,400
you just mush that guy.
Oh,

3333
02:12:20,970 --> 02:12:24,520
so many trolls.
Wow,

3334
02:12:24,521 --> 02:12:26,470
that's rad.
I love that.

3335
02:12:26,950 --> 02:12:27,280
I love it.

3336
02:12:27,280 --> 02:12:28,690
Monsters.
I love monster.

3337
02:12:28,691 --> 02:12:30,910
If there was something that big,
we would've never gotten to where we

3338
02:12:30,911 --> 02:12:33,100
are.
We'd all be holed up in caves right now.

3339
02:12:33,130 --> 02:12:34,900
Yeah.
Well they'd probably be like,

3340
02:12:35,100 --> 02:12:35,760
uh,
the,

3341
02:12:35,760 --> 02:12:37,060
the,
the,

3342
02:12:37,350 --> 02:12:41,380
the tech millionaires are like the guys
who like control one of those,

3343
02:12:41,410 --> 02:12:43,510
like he's just sitting on his head and
he's like,

3344
02:12:43,750 --> 02:12:44,800
kill those people,
you know,

3345
02:12:44,801 --> 02:12:47,020
crush that house.
You know what you think it would be tech

3346
02:12:47,021 --> 02:12:48,030
millionaires?
It would do that.

3347
02:12:50,150 --> 02:12:51,220
Richard's pick person.
No,

3348
02:12:51,221 --> 02:12:53,110
it would not be a tech person.
You,

3349
02:12:53,140 --> 02:12:55,330
I think you to have a trial.
You'd be sitting on a troll.

3350
02:12:55,870 --> 02:12:57,020
Yeah.
Weird.

3351
02:12:57,050 --> 02:13:00,670
When an opinion of me Zuckerberg,
he would have a troll.

3352
02:13:02,200 --> 02:13:04,750
He would,
he would pay someone to like train a

3353
02:13:04,751 --> 02:13:07,030
troll or something like that.
You'd find like a troll trainer.

3354
02:13:07,120 --> 02:13:09,460
And then let me ask you this.
Are you worried at all about ai?

3355
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:10,960
Yes.
All right.

3356
02:13:11,170 --> 02:13:12,160
Oh yeah.
In what way?

3357
02:13:12,610 --> 02:13:16,150
I just wonder when it's going to get out
of our control because it's,

3358
02:13:16,210 --> 02:13:20,080
the technology is escalating beyond our
comprehension comprehension,

3359
02:13:20,320 --> 02:13:22,180
but yet you drive a tesla.
Yeah.

3360
02:13:22,570 --> 02:13:24,280
I do.
Contributing to it a little bit.

3361
02:13:24,400 --> 02:13:25,480
A little bit.
Yeah.

3362
02:13:25,780 --> 02:13:27,520
I mean it's,
I look,

3363
02:13:27,910 --> 02:13:31,000
we all are.
I am,

3364
02:13:31,050 --> 02:13:32,040
I am a dip shit

3365
02:13:32,040 --> 02:13:32,960
and a lot of ways,
I mean,

3366
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:34,650
I'm an idiot and a lot of ways and I'm
just like,

3367
02:13:34,651 --> 02:13:37,230
I know you can hack a tesla.
I know you can.

3368
02:13:37,290 --> 02:13:38,460
Uh,
yeah.

3369
02:13:38,461 --> 02:13:39,600
But they're awesome.
Yeah.

3370
02:13:39,630 --> 02:13:40,081
No,
I mean,

3371
02:13:40,081 --> 02:13:42,050
if you guys drive a car,
I love it there.

3372
02:13:42,051 --> 02:13:45,140
They're apparently not doing so well.
It was some article that a,

3373
02:13:45,141 --> 02:13:47,280
I read today where,
uh,

3374
02:13:47,370 --> 02:13:49,200
there were,
there were talking about the letter that

3375
02:13:49,201 --> 02:13:52,050
Elon Musk's sent to all the people that
work for him saying that you're,

3376
02:13:52,051 --> 02:13:54,780
you're going to have to work harder,
but our goal is to try to save the

3377
02:13:54,781 --> 02:13:55,810
world.
Yeah.

3378
02:13:55,880 --> 02:13:56,350
Like,
see,

3379
02:13:56,350 --> 02:13:58,410
nobody wants to hear that shit and they
work for a company.

3380
02:13:58,470 --> 02:13:59,111
I mean,
and,

3381
02:13:59,111 --> 02:13:59,671
and,
and,

3382
02:13:59,671 --> 02:14:01,590
and,
and really that's not what you're going

3383
02:14:01,591 --> 02:14:02,730
for before.
Well,

3384
02:14:02,731 --> 02:14:07,731
I think his goal is ultimately to reduce
our attachment to fossil fuels,

3385
02:14:08,640 --> 02:14:11,880
which can help save our environment.

3386
02:14:12,630 --> 02:14:14,420
I'm definitely with that.
Uh,

3387
02:14:14,430 --> 02:14:15,510
you know,
uh,

3388
02:14:15,600 --> 02:14:17,940
cut way down on factory farming with
meat,

3389
02:14:18,150 --> 02:14:19,440
you know.
Uh,

3390
02:14:20,580 --> 02:14:21,071
yeah.
I'm,

3391
02:14:21,071 --> 02:14:21,780
I'm,
I'm,

3392
02:14:21,780 --> 02:14:25,410
I'm all in favor with all this,
all that stuff and making way more

3393
02:14:25,411 --> 02:14:26,221
things electric.
It's like,

3394
02:14:26,221 --> 02:14:28,290
why don't we have solar panels on
literally everything.

3395
02:14:28,370 --> 02:14:30,000
Especially in California.
Yeah.

3396
02:14:30,030 --> 02:14:32,160
I mean,
we have sun everywhere,

3397
02:14:32,190 --> 02:14:34,530
everywhere and we have an amazing source
of light,

3398
02:14:34,890 --> 02:14:36,600
but apparently,
you know,

3399
02:14:36,630 --> 02:14:39,810
there's a lot of money involved.
I know this sounds crazy because a lot

3400
02:14:39,811 --> 02:14:42,570
of money involved in staying with the
grid as it is.

3401
02:14:43,190 --> 02:14:45,690
It's a share.
They've got to keep those nuclear power

3402
02:14:45,691 --> 02:14:48,420
plants running.
We love him so much.

3403
02:14:48,421 --> 02:14:50,130
Driving to San Diego,
sightseeing.

3404
02:14:50,190 --> 02:14:50,971
Well,
the old ones,

3405
02:14:50,971 --> 02:14:54,990
they didn't even have a way to shut down
like old power plants when they would

3406
02:14:54,991 --> 02:14:55,810
make them.
Yeah.

3407
02:14:55,810 --> 02:14:58,080
They can't stop them.
They probably figured we'll figure it

3408
02:14:58,081 --> 02:14:58,170
out.

3409
02:14:58,170 --> 02:14:59,660
Eventually.
It's late.

3410
02:15:00,510 --> 02:15:04,590
Let's put it off one day yesterday.
We'll figure someone smarter than us

3411
02:15:04,591 --> 02:15:06,180
will come along.
They'll fix it.

3412
02:15:07,080 --> 02:15:08,050
Yeah.
You when you,

3413
02:15:08,051 --> 02:15:13,051
you really hear about natural disasters
and solar flares and asteroid impacts.

3414
02:15:15,180 --> 02:15:19,650
He just realized how fucking fragile
this weird system that we have of a

3415
02:15:19,651 --> 02:15:24,651
power grid and satellites to distribute
information and the Internet is actually

3416
02:15:24,841 --> 02:15:28,590
a bunch of wires on the ocean floor that
connect us to Europe.

3417
02:15:28,591 --> 02:15:31,770
Like what is wires that are 4,000 miles
long?

3418
02:15:31,771 --> 02:15:32,580
Really?
Yeah,

3419
02:15:32,580 --> 02:15:33,450
yeah,
yeah.

3420
02:15:33,510 --> 02:15:34,590
That it's,
it's,

3421
02:15:35,340 --> 02:15:38,820
it's kind of like the human body,
like it's remarkably resilient but it's

3422
02:15:38,821 --> 02:15:40,770
so fragile.
Super Fragile.

3423
02:15:41,130 --> 02:15:43,290
One infection and that's a wrap.
Yeah.

3424
02:15:43,680 --> 02:15:44,513
Uh Huh.
Yeah.

3425
02:15:44,830 --> 02:15:46,800
Get,
if someone's drunk enough they can fall

3426
02:15:46,801 --> 02:15:49,200
off a building,
had everything going down and land like

3427
02:15:49,201 --> 02:15:51,990
something made a nerf and get up and
sometimes,

3428
02:15:51,991 --> 02:15:54,180
right.
I've watched a video of a guy who was in

3429
02:15:54,181 --> 02:15:58,020
a high speed chase with the cops and he
had a corvette and he flipped a corvette

3430
02:15:58,140 --> 02:16:01,050
and literally they went flying out of it
like he was a doll.

3431
02:16:01,090 --> 02:16:04,080
I saw that head over heels.
Head over heels was fine.

3432
02:16:04,110 --> 02:16:06,570
Yeah.
Landed on his back on the desert floor.

3433
02:16:07,820 --> 02:16:10,110
What?
You got some volume playing in the

3434
02:16:10,111 --> 02:16:10,950
background,
Jamie.

3435
02:16:13,800 --> 02:16:14,940
I'm sad.
Get to hear that too.

3436
02:16:15,240 --> 02:16:17,630
Those things,
they just pop up every now and then.

3437
02:16:17,850 --> 02:16:19,200
Interference I've been hearing
sometimes,

3438
02:16:19,260 --> 02:16:20,400
and I can't tell if you guys are hearing
it.

3439
02:16:20,460 --> 02:16:21,121
Oh really?
I've,

3440
02:16:21,121 --> 02:16:24,780
I've heard a couple of times.
But then you ever heard of songs in your

3441
02:16:24,781 --> 02:16:29,781
fillings?
Some people have recorded that.

3442
02:16:29,831 --> 02:16:30,340
They

3443
02:16:30,340 --> 02:16:33,750
hear radio sounds in their feelings.
Uh,

3444
02:16:34,310 --> 02:16:36,760
they pick up wavelengths.
Yeah.

3445
02:16:36,761 --> 02:16:41,590
Like you're filling will somehow or
another catch some radio sound.

3446
02:16:41,750 --> 02:16:43,480
Play it in your Foa.
Maddening.

3447
02:16:43,570 --> 02:16:48,280
When you hear like Mexicans radio
station playing out of your mouth,

3448
02:16:51,020 --> 02:16:54,160
it'll fucking plier to your mouth the
middle of the night so he could sleep.

3449
02:16:54,880 --> 02:16:56,050
Ah,
that'd be fucking brutal.

3450
02:16:56,310 --> 02:16:58,060
Hmm.
Well listen dude,

3451
02:16:58,120 --> 02:17:01,990
um,

3452
02:17:01,991 --> 02:17:06,250
available in February,
February 5th ended avail be available

3453
02:17:06,280 --> 02:17:07,030

Yes.

3454
02:17:07,030 --> 02:17:10,680
You'll be able to get it on t t tell me
all the places Amazon,

3455
02:17:11,140 --> 02:17:12,520
Amazon,
itunes,

3456
02:17:12,521 --> 02:17:13,940
Google play.
Uh,

3457
02:17:13,960 --> 02:17:16,180
I think it's gonna be on steam.
Weirdly enough.

3458
02:17:16,181 --> 02:17:17,510
The video game platform,
uh,

3459
02:17:17,600 --> 02:17:19,180
it's going to be all over the place.
Uh,

3460
02:17:19,750 --> 02:17:21,010
you can stream it,
you can buy it.

3461
02:17:21,100 --> 02:17:23,890
It's gonna come out in vinyl eventually.
But I know,

3462
02:17:23,950 --> 02:17:26,740
yeah,
I'll just put a couple of like a,

3463
02:17:26,741 --> 02:17:28,990
probably about a thousand out in vinyl
if people want to really?

3464
02:17:28,990 --> 02:17:30,340
Yeah.
I mean I,

3465
02:17:30,520 --> 02:17:33,940
it's called final finally live in
Portland and all the whole title is like

3466
02:17:33,941 --> 02:17:36,090
fake tattoos,
like dummies.

3467
02:17:36,910 --> 02:17:37,780
Where'd you film it?
At?

3468
02:17:37,781 --> 02:17:40,150
The Paris.
A former porn theater downtown port.

3469
02:17:40,170 --> 02:17:42,070
Oh.
They had a porn theater and I was a kid.

3470
02:17:42,071 --> 02:17:43,540
There were always like,
you know,

3471
02:17:43,580 --> 02:17:45,780
uh,
sluts and butts and stuff like that on

3472
02:17:45,781 --> 02:17:46,480
the,
on the,

3473
02:17:46,480 --> 02:17:47,590
on the,
on the marquee.

3474
02:17:47,591 --> 02:17:48,710
And then it was a,
yeah,

3475
02:17:48,711 --> 02:17:49,750
I see.
So that'll be like,

3476
02:17:49,751 --> 02:17:53,110
that'll be the cover of the vinyl.
That helium in Portland is amazing.

3477
02:17:53,111 --> 02:17:56,410
I love that club.
I told them where to put it.

3478
02:17:56,560 --> 02:17:58,210
They were like,
where would you put a comedy club?

3479
02:17:58,211 --> 02:18:00,040
I was like southeast Portland,
close to the water.

3480
02:18:00,041 --> 02:18:02,890
So people who live on the west side can
come across the bridge really easy.

3481
02:18:03,250 --> 02:18:05,170
You'll have a lot more space that way.
And uh,

3482
02:18:05,171 --> 02:18:05,680
yeah,
they've,

3483
02:18:05,680 --> 02:18:07,720
they've,
they've kept it running strong and it's,

3484
02:18:07,721 --> 02:18:08,400
and it's awesome.

3485
02:18:08,400 --> 02:18:09,920
It's like a club place to perform,
man.

3486
02:18:09,940 --> 02:18:10,773
Yeah.
Yeah.

3487
02:18:10,810 --> 02:18:11,680
It's a great,
that's another one.

3488
02:18:11,681 --> 02:18:13,750
This design with the low ceiling,
you know,

3489
02:18:13,760 --> 02:18:15,460
it's,
it's well set up and you've got to come

3490
02:18:15,461 --> 02:18:18,130
on advice from a dip shit because you
would kill it.

3491
02:18:18,190 --> 02:18:19,960
Okay.
I can see some good at giving shitty

3492
02:18:19,961 --> 02:18:20,950
advice.
Yes.

3493
02:18:20,980 --> 02:18:21,521
All right.
Yeah,

3494
02:18:21,521 --> 02:18:22,180

3495
02:18:22,180 --> 02:18:23,350
Yeah.
Well thank you brother.
