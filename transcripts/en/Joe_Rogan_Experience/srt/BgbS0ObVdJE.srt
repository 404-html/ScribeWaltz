1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:05,090
Steven shubin junior who made some bad 
ass designs for the Gorilla Orangutan 

2
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:10,970
Chimp and the howler monkey,
and we've added to that Zombie kettle 

3
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:10,970
bells.
Why?

4
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:13,470
Because we're trendy and zombies are in 
style.

5
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:17,690
Are they just painted on his intention 
center?

6
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:19,310
Zombie sculptures?
Look,

7
00:00:19,311 --> 00:00:20,870
I'm not on the line.
I'm looking at.

8
00:00:20,871 --> 00:00:25,871
I'm not on the line.
I'm showing you a screen in front of 

9
00:00:25,871 --> 00:00:25,871
your fat.
Stupid for you.

10
00:00:25,871 --> 00:00:27,110
Yelled at me and he showed me the 
screen.

11
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,680
I'm trying to do a commercial at the 
time.

12
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:29,330
I try and do.
Here.

13
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:30,500
I'm letting you do.
I'm Joe.

14
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:38,230
We sell battle ropes and supplements and
by the way,

15
00:00:38,231 --> 00:00:40,840
this is a shtick that steven brody,
Stevens and I do.

16
00:00:40,841 --> 00:00:42,670
We're not really upset at each other.
Ladies and gentlemen.

17
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:44,800
No Way.
This is fun talk.

18
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:45,760
We're being fun.

19
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:48,020
Who thinks or silly people that don't 
know.

20
00:00:48,021 --> 00:00:49,920
Did you see the drama on the podcast 
today?

21
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:52,250
Challenge Brody?
Brody.

22
00:00:52,251 --> 00:00:57,251
What kind of your.
Your apartment has tons of workout gear 

23
00:00:57,251 --> 00:01:00,400
like like do you have any of this shit?
Do you have any of these cases or clubs 

24
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,660
because was like,
it's hard to look around.

25
00:01:02,661 --> 00:01:04,270
What's the best angle for me?
Okay.

26
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:09,280
I can see I have one of the wheel balls 
on the lower right for abs ab wheel 

27
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:12,400
roll.
I guess it's an Ab roller.

28
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:15,110
I have.
It looks like a medicine ball.

29
00:01:15,111 --> 00:01:20,111
I have a couple of those and I have 
kettle bells.

30
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,880
Yes,
I have a weighted vest.

31
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:26,590
Yes,
and that's probably it.

32
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:27,890
Oh,
I have a jump rope.

33
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:30,590
I see that in the lower corner.
Have you ever tried battle ropes?

34
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,060
Those are yellow.
I do have ropes that I can sign up to my

35
00:01:35,061 --> 00:01:36,650
car.
The ropes,

36
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:43,230
they're not necessarily heavy.
They're just more to be locked up on 

37
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:43,620
something.
Maybe weigh a lot.

38
00:01:43,621 --> 00:01:43,890
I.
I don't

39
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:44,640
know.
Oh,

40
00:01:44,641 --> 00:01:47,160
so those are like the pole.
They're not like ropes,

41
00:01:47,161 --> 00:01:51,030
like this big fat shipyard ropes.
You ever done these kinds of workouts?

42
00:01:51,031 --> 00:01:51,780
Battle ropes?
No.

43
00:01:51,781 --> 00:01:53,520
I'd like to.
I've seen them on really fun.

44
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:55,170
Awesome.
Full body workout.

45
00:01:55,350 --> 00:02:00,350
You.
We have some videos available at 

46
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:00,350
[inaudible] dot com.
You can learn how to do it.

47
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:03,711
It's fairly easy.
Just a bunch of different simple 

48
00:02:03,711 --> 00:02:03,711
exercises.
Also,

49
00:02:03,711 --> 00:02:04,620
if you go online,
you see the video that we have,

50
00:02:04,621 --> 00:02:09,621
but if you go online,
there's plenty of different workouts 

51
00:02:09,621 --> 00:02:11,661
that you could follow along.
One of the coolest things about the 

52
00:02:11,661 --> 00:02:11,661
Internet,
if you have questions about something,

53
00:02:11,661 --> 00:02:16,101
there's a lot of generous people out 
there that will give you their time for 

54
00:02:16,101 --> 00:02:18,240
free and show you cool shit like this,
but battle ropes is a great exercise for

55
00:02:18,241 --> 00:02:21,600
functional strength and Cardio.
Really good for martial artists.

56
00:02:21,601 --> 00:02:25,020
If you're into a striking or grappling,
either one of them,

57
00:02:25,021 --> 00:02:30,021
you can benefit pretty substantially 
from a good a kettle bell and battle 

58
00:02:30,021 --> 00:02:30,210
rope workout.

59
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:34,020
We also sell supplements,
all kinds of shit at onnit Dotcom,

60
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:39,170
all kinds of fantastic stuff.
We call ourselves a human optimization 

61
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:41,640
website because we basically sell you 
all this shit that actually works as far

62
00:02:41,641 --> 00:02:45,570
as like making different areas of your 
body work better.

63
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:50,600
Like shroom tech sport,
which is a great supplement for 

64
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:50,970
endurance.
It's based on the quarter Sepsis,

65
00:02:50,971 --> 00:02:52,380
mushroom,
a lot of vitamin B,

66
00:02:52,381 --> 00:02:57,381
12 in their new mood,
which is a based on five htp 

67
00:02:57,381 --> 00:03:00,270
supplements,
five htp and l Tryptophan,

68
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:05,280
which converts to five htp.
All those help your brain produce more 

69
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:05,650
serotonin actually get you feeling 
better.

70
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:06,390
La,
la,

71
00:03:06,391 --> 00:03:06,800
la,
la,

72
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:11,810
la.
If I went on forever about all the 

73
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:11,810
groovy shit@on.com
is commercial,

74
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:12,880
be three hours long and you guys 
wouldn't be listening anymore.

75
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,170
Let's be honest on a.com
o n and it used code named Brogan.

76
00:03:17,171 --> 00:03:19,300
Save yourself 10 percent off any and all
supplements.

77
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:24,570
Steven Brody Stevens is here.
Let's get freaky plays in general

78
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:32,690
experience.
Ladies and gentlemen,

79
00:03:35,811 --> 00:03:38,390
Steven Brody Stevens is here.

80
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:41,550
He's excited.
He's a new man.

81
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:44,430
He's on comedy central now.
People are finally starting to recognize

82
00:03:44,431 --> 00:03:46,620
your talent.
Brody feels good.

83
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:49,140
These motherfuckers,
they tried to hold you back for so long.

84
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:52,500
They were afraid of your originality,
your unique talents,

85
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:54,480
the vibe you give off,
all the above.

86
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:57,000
You scared the public.
You scared the private.

87
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:01,280
I think at one point maybe.
I mean,

88
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:03,320
there've been times.
Yeah.

89
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:06,620
I'm going to ask one question before on 
Brian,

90
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,020
are there going to be the monitors 
there?

91
00:04:08,021 --> 00:04:13,021
I get distracted sometimes.
What do you think I should do if this 

92
00:04:13,021 --> 00:04:13,021
monitor?
Yeah,

93
00:04:13,021 --> 00:04:14,920
maybe one of us will monitor over there.
That's bothering you.

94
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:18,220
You don't want to focus on joe gets 
distracted.

95
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:19,630
Yeah,
me too.

96
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:21,790
I did a podcast.
Show them both off.

97
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:26,791
Fuck.
It will shut them both off unless we 

98
00:04:26,791 --> 00:04:26,791
need.
So it doesn't.

99
00:04:26,791 --> 00:04:26,791
Brian have to do that now.
He doesn't have to do it.

100
00:04:26,791 --> 00:04:27,280
Jamie just shut them off.
Okay.

101
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:30,520
Alright.
I'll just seeing new things like this.

102
00:04:30,521 --> 00:04:32,710
I closed my left thigh and then I'm 
good,

103
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,480
but he was.
I could see that one.

104
00:04:34,481 --> 00:04:35,530
Yeah.
That bothers you.

105
00:04:35,531 --> 00:04:37,290
That's like a fucking 100 yards away.
No,

106
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,010
but I can.
It's like right in my.

107
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:43,360
What's the Tarzan distracting me?
It's Kinda just a joke.

108
00:04:43,361 --> 00:04:48,361
I did a show earlier of visual live show
and I felt like it'd be funny to where 

109
00:04:48,701 --> 00:04:53,701
like I said,
I've stolen Brian and these guys 

110
00:04:53,701 --> 00:04:56,491
earlier.
I feel like that I have a three day 

111
00:04:56,491 --> 00:04:56,620
window to kind of goof around A.
Again,

112
00:04:56,621 --> 00:04:57,970
I'm not going to wear this out in 
public,

113
00:04:57,971 --> 00:05:02,971
but I'll wear it on the show a word on a
podcast that's three day window to goof 

114
00:05:02,971 --> 00:05:06,611
around before what a well before and 
after like having that comedy central 

115
00:05:07,091 --> 00:05:11,680
show.
I felt like maybe before it I could be a

116
00:05:11,681 --> 00:05:16,681
little more outgoing on twitter,
but to make some statements be real,

117
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,240
get things off my chest,
not cold man.

118
00:05:19,241 --> 00:05:24,241
I put just Kinda say I wanted to share 
with the audience kind of what was 

119
00:05:24,241 --> 00:05:24,480
going,
you know,

120
00:05:24,481 --> 00:05:28,300
going on in my mind before something was
gonna happen.

121
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:32,260
I could because I knew episode one was 
going to be good.

122
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:35,260
I knew that based on.
I had good reviews.

123
00:05:35,261 --> 00:05:36,430
The show,
what's it called?

124
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:39,790
It's called Brody Stevens.
Enjoy it.

125
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:45,030
Great Name.
Well thank you and enjoy it if you want 

126
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:45,310
to hear it.
Just.

127
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:49,720
It just came from my ear.
Early years at Arizona State.

128
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:54,870
My freshman year I would go get,
go to Mcdonald's actually like on a 

129
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:59,101
Sunday and read the newspaper and the 
girl working there was just a.

130
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:04,210
She was just overly positive.
Like I order a big Mac Combo and she 

131
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:04,900
guys keep them off.
Oh,

132
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:09,910
it's going to show you the trailer if 
you wanted to see the trailer for 

133
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:09,910
Brody's.
Neisha let,

134
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:10,340
let's just talk for a while.
We'll show it later.

135
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:15,290
Um,
and she was just like so nice and like,

136
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:18,770
and she was a slightly handicapped,
but that's not the point.

137
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:21,760
Should I just remember she would slide 
it across the,

138
00:06:21,761 --> 00:06:25,210
uh,
the counter there and to go enjoy and it

139
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:26,110
just like,
wow.

140
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:29,090
It's like she's really into her job and 
it's big dot.

141
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,130
It's Mcdonald's and she doesn't have to 
be.

142
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:35,150
And then I saw her working at Wendy's 
around the corner.

143
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:40,180
This is a true story.
I went in there and ordered a chocolate 

144
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:40,430
frosty,
which at the time wasn't available.

145
00:06:40,431 --> 00:06:43,280
I updated that because at one point it 
was only frosties.

146
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:46,220
So anyway,
chocolate for you update it yourself.

147
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,290
Yeah.
Well,

148
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:53,310
you know,
back in the day like chocolate frosties 

149
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:55,370
and vanilla frosties,
there's only chocolate frosty.

150
00:06:55,400 --> 00:07:00,400
Right?
So see when you go to Wendy's and you 

151
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:00,400
said I'm going to get a chocolate 
frosty.

152
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,640
It was redundant because they didn't 
have other options.

153
00:07:01,641 --> 00:07:04,490
This is in the 1988,
but anyway,

154
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:07,850
going through the drive through,
I get my drink and my food,

155
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:10,460
the double double and she reaches out 
and she goes,

156
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,490
enjoy.
Same Lady,

157
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:16,070
different restaurant,
fast food.

158
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:18,470
Well I guess she decided that was her 
living,

159
00:07:18,471 --> 00:07:23,471
like maybe she dealt,
worked double shifts and it just stuck 

160
00:07:23,471 --> 00:07:23,471
in my mind.

161
00:07:23,471 --> 00:07:27,730
Enjoy.
And then I brought it around the 

162
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:27,730
baseball team at Arizona state and was 
like,

163
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:27,730
enjoy,
enjoy it,

164
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:29,210
enjoy that.
Enjoy us.

165
00:07:29,211 --> 00:07:32,210
It just kind of took a life of its own.
That's beautiful.

166
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:34,820
She stepped up.
She went from Mcdonald's.

167
00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:39,821
Wendy's.
Wendy's is probably higher quality 

168
00:07:39,821 --> 00:07:39,821
burger.
Hey,

169
00:07:39,821 --> 00:07:39,821
better if I have to choose between the 
two.

170
00:07:39,821 --> 00:07:40,160
Yeah.
Wendy's.

171
00:07:40,161 --> 00:07:42,170
You feel like you're getting a little 
bit.

172
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:43,160
Yeah.
It's a better.

173
00:07:43,161 --> 00:07:44,430
It's a better patty.
Yeah.

174
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:49,570
It's a better patty and better,
better taste and probably a better gig 

175
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:50,020
and you're sitting down there.
You feel it.

176
00:07:50,021 --> 00:07:54,140
It's a little more warm.
There's it's more wood panel there.

177
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:56,770
You'll find that it's more country where
you were.

178
00:07:56,771 --> 00:08:00,350
It reminds you of that one dude that 
used to be an all those cars date.

179
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:06,190
He's play Santa Claus for me because my 
mom used to work for the headquarters 

180
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:06,190
and he would dress up as Santa Claus 
every year.

181
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:07,970
And as a kid I have all these photos of 
me on his lap,

182
00:08:07,971 --> 00:08:10,190
him dressed up as Santa Claus and me 
crying and stuff.

183
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:11,630
Oh,
the Wendy's guy made you cry.

184
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:13,910
Yeah.
Will you just cried and everything.

185
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:19,480
The winds blow and the new Wendy's girl,
I will you be quiet about Santa Claus 

186
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,440
because you know,
was like three or four,

187
00:08:21,441 --> 00:08:26,441
you know what I mean,
like three year olds who's cried 

188
00:08:26,441 --> 00:08:26,441
anything.
But it has me all the way up to like 14.

189
00:08:26,441 --> 00:08:28,370
Like I have a picture of me old.
So,

190
00:08:28,371 --> 00:08:29,900
uh,
that's where enjoy it came from.

191
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:35,030
That's where that title came from and I 
just good one around the baseball team.

192
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,330
Enjoy it.
Yes.

193
00:08:36,331 --> 00:08:38,990
And guys picked up on it and there's a 
couple other phrases.

194
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:42,350
Simple was another one.
We'd play video games and I'm,

195
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,000
I'm better,
I'm better than you.

196
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:47,720
Simple.
So it was Kinda like that simple.

197
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:52,750
So we both enjoy it because when you 
play baseball and you have to be vocal 

198
00:08:53,811 --> 00:08:58,200
supporting your teammates and you're in 
the dugout quite a bit and you just come

199
00:08:58,201 --> 00:08:59,370
up with funny stuff.
You.

200
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,950
I was able to rag other teams,
you know,

201
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:04,440
obviously not cursing or anything like 
that,

202
00:09:04,441 --> 00:09:07,050
but you know,
make fun of batterers or make fun of it.

203
00:09:07,051 --> 00:09:09,660
Third basement or another picture kind 
of thing.

204
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:10,570
So.
Well.

205
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:12,470
So you had these little catchphrases.
Yeah,

206
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,520
I got better at it.
At first I was bad.

207
00:09:14,521 --> 00:09:19,521
It was like comb your hair.
It's like a roadie know you're going to 

208
00:09:19,521 --> 00:09:21,270
have to take it.
Take the game off.

209
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:23,490
You got to step up your,
your phrase game.

210
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:24,540
Yeah.
You learned.

211
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:26,100
Do you stick with numbers?
That's good.

212
00:09:26,101 --> 00:09:29,970
Like 22 deuces.
11 sticks.

213
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,850
Legs,
one's arm.

214
00:09:32,851 --> 00:09:35,280
She just have fun.
I had fun with like joking with numbers.

215
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:40,300
Birch.
These are the things you would yell out 

216
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:40,300
while the Games going on.
Is that what it is?

217
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:40,300
Yeah.
Like supporting your teammates.

218
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:42,930
So like Rogan's at the play.
You're wearing number 11.

219
00:09:42,931 --> 00:09:43,920
Rogan.
Yes.

220
00:09:43,921 --> 00:09:45,350
Here we go.
Sticks.

221
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,790
Let's do it.
Making contact.

222
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:52,690
I'm great hat.
I don't know what else I was working,

223
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:56,190
but I was just something that you just 
sort of picked up along the way.

224
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:58,230
I would.
Well,

225
00:09:58,231 --> 00:10:00,600
I guess I kind of work on it,
but I would pick it up along the way.

226
00:10:00,601 --> 00:10:01,230
Yeah,
with you.

227
00:10:01,231 --> 00:10:03,560
I would say numbers.
I wouldn't say come on Rogan.

228
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:04,890
I wouldn't say it like that.
I go,

229
00:10:04,891 --> 00:10:06,300
come on buddy.
I'd say that,

230
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:11,720
but then I would do the Jesus' love 
yourself.

231
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:14,370
You know why?
I'll tell you why you panic.

232
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:15,410
No,
I'm not manic.

233
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:19,530
I've been dumping drinks over p a n o a 
mannequin panic.

234
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:22,650
But you know what?
These are quick silver and fibia shorts.

235
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:25,350
They can.
You can wear them in the water.

236
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:27,090
Oh,
this is what's called the secret plug.

237
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:32,390
I see what you did.
Love to work with water on yourself on 

238
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:34,380
purpose to get quick silver migration or
comedy central show.

239
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:39,530
You're a very smart guy in that respect 
that you submitted the nets that have 

240
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:39,530
been chasing.
I know you wouldn't know it.

241
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:41,800
There's somebody who knows it out there.
Somebody who knows.

242
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:43,230
What did he do?
He,

243
00:10:43,231 --> 00:10:48,231
uh,
spilt water on the court to kind of 

244
00:10:48,231 --> 00:10:49,170
delay the game against the Lakers the 
other night because it's a,

245
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,540
they were losing and they had to get a 
time out or something.

246
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:52,780
And so once the,
uh,

247
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:58,070
spilled the court water on it,
they had to clean it up and while 

248
00:10:58,070 --> 00:10:58,070
they're cleaning up,
they designed to play.

249
00:10:58,230 --> 00:10:59,220
It's,
I kind of cheating.

250
00:10:59,250 --> 00:10:59,910
There's been a bunch of.
Yeah,

251
00:10:59,911 --> 00:10:59,960
two

252
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:05,740
things over the years where guys have 
done various things in the octagon that 

253
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:06,980
were illegal to,
to,

254
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,850
to make things more slippery.
Like vaseline.

255
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:12,260
Yeah.
But when the UFC,

256
00:11:12,261 --> 00:11:15,170
when you throw water on the canvas,
it actually gives you more traction.

257
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:15,800
Oh,
it does?

258
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:20,830
Yeah.
Guys actually throw water on the ground 

259
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:20,830
before they fight and then they step 
into that legal or no?

260
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:21,580
Yes.
Okay.

261
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:22,570
Yes.
It's all good.

262
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:23,720
It's not bad.
Um,

263
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:26,540
you're not supposed to pour too much 
water on yourself.

264
00:11:26,541 --> 00:11:28,940
Like sometimes you'll see the referee 
drying a guy off.

265
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:30,860
Oh really?
Before he goes out for the next round.

266
00:11:30,861 --> 00:11:35,861
Yeah.
Because like say if you're fighting a 

267
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:36,380
grappler and you come out completely 
soaking wet,

268
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:39,800
like literally dripping wet,
it's way harder to grab you.

269
00:11:39,801 --> 00:11:44,801
Your slippery.
You slip out of things like you're the 

270
00:11:44,801 --> 00:11:44,801
swim pool.
Yeah.

271
00:11:44,801 --> 00:11:48,911
And that's slipperiness can make the 
difference between a submission and an 

272
00:11:48,911 --> 00:11:48,911
escape.

273
00:11:48,911 --> 00:11:49,060
Like it's that it's a big deal.
Yeah.

274
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:50,630
It's a pretty big factor.
Oil.

275
00:11:50,631 --> 00:11:53,110
A lot of guys have oil,
the oil up like uh,

276
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,790
baby oil.
Yeah.

277
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:56,140
You know what they do?
That's cheating,

278
00:11:56,141 --> 00:11:56,920
right?
Yes.

279
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,260
One of the things that guys have done is
they,

280
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:04,390
um,
it's been rumored that they lie and 

281
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:07,471
mineral baths at night.
So they take this bath with a mineral 

282
00:12:07,471 --> 00:12:11,080
oils and they just soak in it for 
fucking like an hour or whatever.

283
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,760
And then they take a shower.
Okay.

284
00:12:12,761 --> 00:12:15,700
And then when they sweat the next day,
even though the skin is dry,

285
00:12:15,701 --> 00:12:16,870
when they started out,
when they sweat,

286
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:22,060
they are just so lit as fuck.
But they're not technically illegal.

287
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:24,970
They're not technically illegal because 
they are clean.

288
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:26,590
Like if you,
if you touch them,

289
00:12:26,591 --> 00:12:27,830
you're not going to see,
you know,

290
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:31,300
not going to feel like an oily.
There's no health benefit from it.

291
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:36,590
Well,
I'm sure it's probably good for your 

292
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:36,590
skin.
Really keeps you lovely.

293
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:39,640
I try to take a mineral oil bath.
There was a guy who is a actually kicked

294
00:12:39,641 --> 00:12:40,970
out a coroner's.
Uh,

295
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:46,200
I dunno for life or what,
but it was for a long time because he 

296
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:50,161
was rubbing vaseline on guys.
He would like do this chest massage 

297
00:12:50,161 --> 00:12:51,760
thing while I was doing.
It was rubbing vaseline on them.

298
00:12:51,761 --> 00:12:53,980
He rubbed their neck and he was rubbing 
vaseline on them.

299
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:56,860
He was actually making them more 
slippery.

300
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:58,360
She has a latent.
Yeah,

301
00:12:58,361 --> 00:13:00,850
it was his corner man.
It was blatant.

302
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:02,620
They were saying that they were doing 
this.

303
00:13:02,621 --> 00:13:07,621
Uh,
there's a guy who used to work with 

304
00:13:07,621 --> 00:13:08,590
fighters that claim to be like a witch 
doctor.

305
00:13:08,591 --> 00:13:13,591
They called them the witch doctor and he
had this whole series of things that he 

306
00:13:13,591 --> 00:13:14,350
would do to guys to like align their 
shockers and shit.

307
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:15,910
I Dunno,
I dunno what Angelo.

308
00:13:15,911 --> 00:13:17,560
Dundee?
No,

309
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:20,320
I don't remember.
I don't remember the gentleman's name,

310
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:25,500
but he used to rub dudes chests and like
a circle and pat their neck and this is 

311
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:28,150
corner man was doing that right after he
applied vaseline to his face.

312
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:30,640
So whether or not it was intentional is,
you know,

313
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:35,670
only he knows that what he was doing was
with this Voodoo move with vaseline on 

314
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:35,880
his hand.
Oh,

315
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:38,140
it's Kinda.
So it's kind of illegal.

316
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:41,200
Any he might not have realized he had 
just put vaseline on his face.

317
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:44,350
Anderson Silva did it wants to,
if he wiped vaseline off of his face and

318
00:13:44,351 --> 00:13:46,390
put it on his chest and his arms like in
front of everybody.

319
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:48,050
You don't,
they do that in boxing.

320
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,460
They put.
Yeah.

321
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:51,190
On your faces.
Okay.

322
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,500
Oh,
it is a big difference is having on your

323
00:13:53,501 --> 00:13:54,430
arms and chest.

324
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:59,490
Gotcha.
Because then if guys go to clinch up 

325
00:13:59,490 --> 00:13:59,490
with you,
he slipped away from them and you know,

326
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:01,780
Anderson did it like really blatantly 
one fight.

327
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:02,580
Oh really?
Yeah.

328
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,510
Well they don't let them do it anymore.
They make sure you know,

329
00:14:04,511 --> 00:14:09,511
there's,
you gotta realize MMA is only 20 years 

330
00:14:09,511 --> 00:14:09,511
old.
They're still meet.

331
00:14:09,511 --> 00:14:10,780
We just celebrated the UFC,
celebrate its 20th anniversary,

332
00:14:10,781 --> 00:14:15,781
so like there's a lot of rules like have
to get made up along the way and it's 

333
00:14:15,781 --> 00:14:18,210
still evolving.
Still some fuckery afoot pretty Stevens,

334
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,290
but you know what?
It's a,

335
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:24,910
it's probably the sport.
It's not going to change all that much 

336
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:28,171
over the years.
I don't think it could use a few 

337
00:14:28,171 --> 00:14:28,171
changes.
It can be easy food changes,

338
00:14:28,171 --> 00:14:31,090
but it might be say like a golf or a,
a tennis,

339
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,290
which is Kinda,
you know,

340
00:14:32,291 --> 00:14:35,280
over the years I guess those gentlemen,
Gentlemen,

341
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:40,320
sports mma will never be that.
You don't think so you think it will 

342
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,170
evolve into different rules or 
different.

343
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:44,980
It's always going to be really primal 
because that's what would its appeal is,

344
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:50,020
its appeal is and in this water down 
society where everything's nerfed and 

345
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:52,070
the whole world is fucking sanitary.
There's one sport where shit gets

346
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:53,840
real as real,
as fun.

347
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:58,140
It does two dudes who are pushing 
themselves for five minutes per round in

348
00:14:58,141 --> 00:15:03,141
a championship match.
You're talking about 25 minutes of 

349
00:15:03,141 --> 00:15:06,340
ferocity in Connecticut Energy and just 
thinking and sweat and blood and 

350
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:11,300
injuries and through things and trying 
to overcome.

351
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,350
I mean,
it's a fucking,

352
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:17,560
it's primal.
Primal gets the most exciting sport of 

353
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,920
all time and you're right up there with 
baseball.

354
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,860
Ah,
how dare you know,

355
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:23,030
daily.
Even compare those.

356
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:27,550
That's what I always,
when people complain about ground,

357
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:30,020
fighting over a guy holding a guy down 
in the ground and I'm like,

358
00:15:30,021 --> 00:15:32,120
as boring as it is,
it's not as boring as baseball.

359
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,390
Baseball,
fuck.

360
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,870
I don't watch a lot of baseball.
You watch plenty.

361
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:38,030
No.
I like going watch too much.

362
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:39,140
No,
I don't have much.

363
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,330
Not very much.
How much is not very much.

364
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,210
Um,
I mean,

365
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:45,560
I,
I don't honestly,

366
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,450
I don't,
I don't watch a lot of TV.

367
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,130
Don't lie to America.
Brody Stevens.

368
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,690
I'll tell you what I like about 
baseball.

369
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:53,810
I like going down early before the fans 
get there,

370
00:15:53,811 --> 00:15:56,900
hanging out with the team,
watching the batting practice,

371
00:15:56,901 --> 00:16:01,901
playing grab ass if you want to,
if you want to call it that 10 percent 

372
00:16:01,901 --> 00:16:02,800
having fun.
Um,

373
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:05,780
that's what I then stay for a few 
innings and then go home.

374
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:10,840
Well,
it seems like your sense of humor 

375
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,341
actually was kind of developed from the 
comradery of like hanging out with guys 

376
00:16:12,741 --> 00:16:15,890
that you were playing with,
so that makes sense that you would enjoy

377
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:17,510
that camaraderie.
Like enjoy it.

378
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:22,620
I enjoy it.
It in a simple like making and making 

379
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:26,600
everybody laugh that you got that 
camaraderie of like teammates,

380
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:29,270
like working out together,
hanging out together.

381
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:32,060
Like people who've never experienced 
that sort of environment.

382
00:16:32,061 --> 00:16:34,010
They don't really totally understand it,
do they?

383
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:38,270
I would,
I would think not only because,

384
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:43,870
yeah,
I got to play baseball and first of all 

385
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:44,270
at Arizona state and we're flying 
around.

386
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:47,930
We had to be professionals and represent
the university.

387
00:16:47,931 --> 00:16:49,840
And then yeah,
going off the plane,

388
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:54,850
the summertime up to Alaska and you're,
you're up there and you're meeting guys 

389
00:16:55,281 --> 00:16:57,110
from different schools and you're,
yeah,

390
00:16:57,111 --> 00:17:02,111
you're traveling,
you're sharing hotel rooms and lot of 

391
00:17:02,111 --> 00:17:02,540
those experiences.
Yeah.

392
00:17:02,541 --> 00:17:07,520
And then they'll the locker room stuff 
and the parties and the jokes on the bus

393
00:17:07,521 --> 00:17:11,180
and getting in trouble as a team at,
you know,

394
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:15,470
I,
I'm dad helped us define who I am.

395
00:17:15,471 --> 00:17:16,750
It defined.
I,

396
00:17:16,751 --> 00:17:18,260
I enjoyed that.
Yes.

397
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:19,510
You know,
having that,

398
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,380
I think that that's something that 
everybody could use.

399
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:25,570
I think that's one of the benefits of 
competing in a sport is that you go when

400
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:30,580
you hang out with a bunch of people that
are also doing the same thing and you 

401
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:30,580
learn together,
you know,

402
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:31,640
I think that's missing from a lot of 
people.

403
00:17:31,641 --> 00:17:36,641
Man.
I think that's missing from a lot of 

404
00:17:36,641 --> 00:17:36,641
people.
Never get involved in sports.

405
00:17:36,641 --> 00:17:36,920
Yeah.
I would add would after the.

406
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I mean my freshman year I would always,
because I wasn't a top guy so I didn't 

407
00:17:42,021 --> 00:17:46,250
get the instruction from the coaches 
like the top recruit.

408
00:17:46,251 --> 00:17:51,251
So I would go to the other,
the other pitchers of senior pictures 

409
00:17:51,251 --> 00:17:51,251
and I say,
can you guys

410
00:17:51,251 --> 00:17:52,830
help me out a little bit with my 
mechanics?

411
00:17:52,831 --> 00:17:56,490
And there was a,
a big a window where you can look in and

412
00:17:56,491 --> 00:17:59,460
work on your throwing mechanics.
And these guys would work with me,

413
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:04,610
so I didn't like,
I knew the coach was focusing on these 

414
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:04,980
other guys and I never got upset about,
oh,

415
00:18:04,981 --> 00:18:06,630
I'm not in the game.
I'm not good enough.

416
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:09,740
I just said I want to become,
you know,

417
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:14,840
the best picture I could be and work on 
my mechanics difference in pitching 

418
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:18,981
between the really awesome dudes.
The guys would get scouted and a guy 

419
00:18:18,981 --> 00:18:20,070
like you.
What's the difference?

420
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:20,390
Well,
I,

421
00:18:20,391 --> 00:18:22,050
I,
I did get scouted,

422
00:18:22,051 --> 00:18:24,020
but I would say,
you know,

423
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:27,580
what they look for today is probably,
you know,

424
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:32,600
size is a Gigaton of fill into his body.
Um,

425
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:35,400
you know,
having long arms,

426
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,350
you know,
a good attitude,

427
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:42,770
you know,
is there a motion going to be where 

428
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:43,590
they're not gonna hurt their shoulder 
hurt their arms.

429
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,810
So they're motion as far as the way they
throw.

430
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:48,420
Yeah.
You can see a guy how he throws,

431
00:18:48,421 --> 00:18:53,421
like naturally he may throw we strange 
where I can see an injury coming on if 

432
00:18:55,021 --> 00:19:00,021
he doesn't adjust that.
Whereas some guys had jeff perfect 

433
00:19:00,021 --> 00:19:04,100
smooth mechanics and it's,
they're very specific technique when it 

434
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,700
comes to throwing a hardball.
I think there's,

435
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:09,100
there's specific techniques,
gas and then there's,

436
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:14,110
I mean within that there's some coaches 
and some philosophies that have 

437
00:19:14,311 --> 00:19:16,280
variations on that,
so,

438
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:18,330
but there's a few famous guys who 
deviate,

439
00:19:18,331 --> 00:19:18,930
right,
like they go,

440
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:20,700
they throw side arm.
Yeah.

441
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:24,030
Their side armors are,
I mean a sidearm or could be.

442
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:26,190
Yeah,
they just get more action.

443
00:19:26,191 --> 00:19:28,380
They throw over the top and there were 
an okay picture,

444
00:19:28,381 --> 00:19:33,381
but they figured out that those side arm
and that book's act different action on 

445
00:19:33,381 --> 00:19:37,611
the ball and some guys can't do that or 
don't want to do that or you don't have 

446
00:19:37,611 --> 00:19:38,100
to show baseball.

447
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:43,110
James,
that's brody pitching at Arizona State 

448
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:43,110
pitchers.
Brody,

449
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:47,010
you're on youtube.
I guess I have one video of me pitching 

450
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:47,010
on Youtube.
How did you do?

451
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:49,290
I gave up a home run.
It's just the alumni game.

452
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:52,170
It's the only time you've ever pitched?
No,

453
00:19:52,171 --> 00:19:54,300
I patched my.
I pitched,

454
00:19:54,301 --> 00:19:57,270
I think my record was foreign one.
I pitched three years.

455
00:19:57,271 --> 00:19:59,310
I was injured here and there,
but I pitched.

456
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:02,370
I was four and one.
I think I had a few saves.

457
00:20:02,371 --> 00:20:07,371
My era was three point something.
I 28 strike out and maybe had 31.

458
00:20:07,741 --> 00:20:12,030
I had more strikeouts per innings and I 
had a 11 walk.

459
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,420
What's that one crazy surgery that 
baseball players,

460
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:17,640
Tommy Johns elective,
the Tommy John Surgery.

461
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:22,940
How does that work?
You take a ligament out of your wrist 

462
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:22,940
and you put it in your elbow.
Is that what it is?

463
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:23,400
Yeah,
that's Kinda what it was.

464
00:20:23,401 --> 00:20:24,410
That was the,
uh,

465
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:27,870
back in the day it was,
they would say you hurt your right arm.

466
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:31,320
They would probably take the poll maris 
tendon at the time.

467
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:32,910
So they would usually take it out of 
your,

468
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,020
your left wrist and they put it in your,
your right elbow.

469
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:39,990
And they would do a figure eight,
kind of tightened it up.

470
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:41,190
Boom.
That's the,

471
00:20:41,191 --> 00:20:42,330
uh,
the Tommy John.

472
00:20:42,331 --> 00:20:47,331
Now they'll take maybe a,
a ligament from your leg

473
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:52,630
or maybe a dead body or even your,
the same arm and they put it in there.

474
00:20:52,631 --> 00:20:56,330
So over the years it's gotten,
I think the surgery is,

475
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:59,000
is become more common place

476
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:04,510
elective surgery on some guys.
Some guys they don't even have an 

477
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:06,941
injury.
They do it because it gives them more 

478
00:21:06,941 --> 00:21:06,941
power.

479
00:21:06,941 --> 00:21:06,941
Um,
I would say no.

480
00:21:06,941 --> 00:21:07,290
I would say.

481
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,080
What do you mean?
No?

482
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:13,220
I know guys have done it.
That baseball players that have said my 

483
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:14,290
arm's fine guys have done.
I mean,

484
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:16,540
I don't know if it's been high level 
pros,

485
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:18,220
but I know it was reading an article 
about,

486
00:21:18,221 --> 00:21:23,221
okay.
It's called a Tommy John Surgery who 

487
00:21:23,221 --> 00:21:24,910
shares the same birthday as me.
Oh my goodness.

488
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:29,970
Tommy John Surgery too.
He still paid similar Tommy John 

489
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:30,450
Surgery.
The next steroids.

490
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:33,280
Look at this when it comes to high 
school and college sports,

491
00:21:33,281 --> 00:21:36,550
young athletes often urine for bigger 
muscles to enhance their performance,

492
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:41,700
but for student baseball,
pitcher strength isn't so much of a 

493
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:44,071
goal.
That is speed throwing speed and now 

494
00:21:44,071 --> 00:21:46,291
student athlete's looking for a way to 
get extra boost in their pitching arm 

495
00:21:46,291 --> 00:21:49,530
had been putting their hopes in an 
elective surgery surgery called the 

496
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:51,880
Ulnar collateral ligament 
reconstruction.

497
00:21:51,881 --> 00:21:53,410
More famously known as Tommy John.

498
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,360
Okay.
I had something very similar to that.

499
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:57,770
There's okay.
It says that,

500
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,040
yes,
they're doing it on purpose.

501
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:04,400
I've read many articles about this.
This isn't like a secret or these high 

502
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:04,400
schoolers.
These are.

503
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,050
Yes,
high school and college athletes.

504
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:07,610
Okay.
I.

505
00:22:07,611 --> 00:22:12,611
Okay.
Thank you for bringing that up and I 

506
00:22:12,611 --> 00:22:14,321
knew,
I know this is the Joe Rogan experience 

507
00:22:14,321 --> 00:22:14,321
and you're going to learn stuff and I 
did.

508
00:22:14,321 --> 00:22:16,670
I learned that if you're asking me right
now,

509
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:21,760
2013,
is there a major leaguer that has 

510
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:27,280
electively like one of these kids in 
high school and we know we have a 

511
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:30,140
problem with high schools and parents 
and the pressure of all that.

512
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:35,800
Is there a major leaguer currently or 
within the past year or two who is 

513
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:39,920
electively gone,
non-injury,

514
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:45,250
electively taken that surgery and 
continued to be in the major leagues and

515
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:50,180
maybe improved.
My guess is no,

516
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:52,040
that's my.
That's my instinct.

517
00:22:52,041 --> 00:22:54,950
That's my guess is that has it has not 
happened,

518
00:22:55,130 --> 00:23:00,130
but you know,
we'll see what happens with this high 

519
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:00,130
school kid or anything.

520
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:01,730
You know though,
if all these kids are getting it done,

521
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:05,270
you don't think that some,
some people have gotten that done?

522
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:06,500
I,
I.

523
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:07,430
Because why would you say that?

524
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:09,170
Well,
here's the deal.

525
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:13,880
If you tear your ligament,
you need the surgery.

526
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:19,240
That's a fact.
If you have the ligament and it's 

527
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:21,020
chronic,
it's not necessarily torn.

528
00:23:21,021 --> 00:23:23,630
It's worn down,
it's off the bone.

529
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:29,170
You're probably going to need the 
surgery and the reason why these guys 

530
00:23:29,361 --> 00:23:34,361
come back stronger,
it's not because the ligament is 

531
00:23:34,361 --> 00:23:38,231
stronger.
I mean that may have something to do 

532
00:23:38,231 --> 00:23:40,511
with it,
but a lot of people also think it's the 

533
00:23:40,511 --> 00:23:43,271
training because you hurt your elbow.
You're going to have to really go extra 

534
00:23:43,271 --> 00:23:46,700
and out of the way to make sure that 
elbow is strong,

535
00:23:46,701 --> 00:23:49,430
so when you're doing the rehab,
you're reaching into the ice,

536
00:23:49,431 --> 00:23:52,400
you're doing all the ultrasound on your 
elbow,

537
00:23:52,401 --> 00:23:55,220
the exercises,
you're doing extra actually,

538
00:23:55,370 --> 00:24:00,370
and that's another reason why people 
come back stronger and I do think that 

539
00:24:00,621 --> 00:24:02,930
yeah,
it doesn't make you bionic,

540
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:08,140
but a lot of guys have come back for 
that surgery and a thrown harder and if 

541
00:24:09,501 --> 00:24:12,440
continued their career,
I think it's yet to be known.

542
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:16,100
If a guy who elects to do it in high 
school or college,

543
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:18,730
it's going to make them throw harder.
You know,

544
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:24,070
if they're hurting and they got it,
I understand if they're having chronic 

545
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:27,581
pains in their elbow and their mechanics
are such where it's not going to get 

546
00:24:27,581 --> 00:24:28,640
better,
it's only going to get worse.

547
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:31,730
So you better adjust your mechanics and 
on top of that,

548
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:34,220
yeah,
let's get the Tommy John Surgery and see

549
00:24:34,221 --> 00:24:34,610
what happens.

550
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:39,690
Injury has been proven to have a 
significant effect on the mechanics of 

551
00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:40,720
your arm.
I think it makes your arms stronger.

552
00:24:40,721 --> 00:24:42,280
It makes it,
makes it throw faster.

553
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:43,810
I think.
I don't agree.

554
00:24:43,930 --> 00:24:48,930
Well,
I don't know if you know that because I 

555
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:49,800
don't think you've got it done and all 
these people are saying it is.

556
00:24:49,810 --> 00:24:51,010
All these doctors,
they're not based.

557
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:52,720
They're not pictures.
Yeah.

558
00:24:52,721 --> 00:24:55,720
But they're working with pitchers.
They're talking about.

559
00:24:56,300 --> 00:25:00,010
They're talking about getting this done 
takes a year to recover.

560
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:03,690
Yeah.
Almost two years actually to it.

561
00:25:03,691 --> 00:25:07,900
Most guys come back,
fully strength back to normal,

562
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:09,690
a year and a half to two years,

563
00:25:09,850 --> 00:25:13,090
put some more strength in your elbow.
And the risks are that,

564
00:25:13,091 --> 00:25:18,091
um,
sometimes after their elbow gets 

565
00:25:18,091 --> 00:25:18,680
reconstructed or just the add this 
additional ligament,

566
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:23,900
uh,
it becomes permanently stiff and their 

567
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:27,281
muscles tear or they can have something 
called I magenic physician induced 

568
00:25:27,831 --> 00:25:30,080
problems with their elbows because of 
the surgery.

569
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:31,760
Say That's not good.
No,

570
00:25:31,761 --> 00:25:32,470
it's not good.
But it's,

571
00:25:32,471 --> 00:25:34,670
it's fascinating that people are doing 
this,

572
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:38,720
that guys are going to.
It's not a small trend either.

573
00:25:38,721 --> 00:25:42,560
There's quite a few guys that are going 
to the doctor and they,

574
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:47,620
they think the doctors saying that they 
see the doctors explaining the 

575
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:48,860
rehabilitation process and how long it 
takes.

576
00:25:48,861 --> 00:25:53,861
No,
it'll take like up to a year to recover 

577
00:25:53,861 --> 00:25:57,251
is what they're saying.
But they're saying that it does have a 

578
00:25:57,251 --> 00:25:58,310
significant impact

579
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:03,060
on May.
It's my phone.

580
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,820
The throwing harder.
Yeah.

581
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,910
I don't agree.
Okay.

582
00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:12,010
That's my opinion at mile at might allow
you to whip your arm more like more arm 

583
00:26:13,251 --> 00:26:16,670
whip [inaudible].
But arm whip is not.

584
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:19,640
I mean that's going to add a mile or 
two.

585
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:23,460
But I'm not a believer in it.
I,

586
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:28,630
I don't.
I want to see a major leaguer that has 

587
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:29,310
had that done and you know,
and,

588
00:26:29,311 --> 00:26:32,690
and electively with no injury,
maybe a cron.

589
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:35,540
I had the surgery done.
I didn't have a tear.

590
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:39,470
I had chronic injuries in my elbow.
My elbow wasn't getting better.

591
00:26:39,471 --> 00:26:42,050
I had bad mechanics.
I got an MRI and they go,

592
00:26:42,051 --> 00:26:43,740
you know what,
the ligament,

593
00:26:43,741 --> 00:26:48,741
I see damage in there.
I can't tell there is damage in your 

594
00:26:48,741 --> 00:26:48,741
elbow.
And then they,

595
00:26:48,741 --> 00:26:49,770
oh,
and he asked me,

596
00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:51,870
uh,
you may need Tommy John Surgery,

597
00:26:51,871 --> 00:26:54,510
do you want to take the tendon out of 
your left elbow,

598
00:26:54,810 --> 00:26:55,830
left wrist?
And I go,

599
00:26:55,831 --> 00:26:58,950
yes.
And they did the surgery and he saw that

600
00:26:58,951 --> 00:27:03,951
my ligament was intact and he stapled it
back down to the bone and he tightened 

601
00:27:04,501 --> 00:27:07,200
me up and that wasn't the Tommy John 
Surgery.

602
00:27:07,201 --> 00:27:07,560
But

603
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:09,790
yeah,
a lot.

604
00:27:09,791 --> 00:27:12,900
A lot of people who agree with you 
apparently also about the rehabilitation

605
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:16,380
that that's really what's helping them 
and that it's not necessarily the,

606
00:27:16,381 --> 00:27:18,660
uh,
throwing harder throwing.

607
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:23,690
It's not necessarily the ligament,
but that it might just be the 

608
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:26,241
rehabilitation,
the emphasis that you put into 

609
00:27:26,241 --> 00:27:26,241
rehabilitation that yeah,

610
00:27:26,241 --> 00:27:26,241
that was.
Maybe you can do,

611
00:27:26,241 --> 00:27:28,290
but maybe you.
Maybe you can do that on your.

612
00:27:28,291 --> 00:27:29,640
Once you do that in any way.

613
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:34,840
Yeah,
I think it's actually pretty 

614
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:34,840
controversial,
but I'm gonna I'm gonna.

615
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:34,840
Ask around.
Yeah,

616
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:35,260
I will.

617
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:40,510
I wouldn't do it.
I W I would wait until you have a 

618
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:42,320
chronic injury or it pops in tears like,
you know,

619
00:27:42,321 --> 00:27:43,640
you did it,
you know,

620
00:27:43,641 --> 00:27:47,420
mine was a chronic buildup thing and it 
was due to bad mechanics,

621
00:27:47,421 --> 00:27:52,400
so if you have bad mechanics and you get
this elective surgery ahead of time,

622
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:55,070
you're still going to have bad mechanics
and you know what?

623
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:56,990
Some people have to get a second 
surgery.

624
00:27:57,350 --> 00:27:59,930
It's not just the one time.
You can tear it again.

625
00:27:59,931 --> 00:28:00,530
Actually.

626
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:05,640
Yeah.
That's super common with the knees guys 

627
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,070
who have acl reconstructions,
they blow it out all the time.

628
00:28:06,071 --> 00:28:08,380
I can think of several fighters,
dominick Cruz,

629
00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:11,890
current bantamweight champion had his 
acl reconstructed,

630
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,690
blew it out.
How to have it done again.

631
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:18,100
So He's been out almost two years when 
he fights Hanan Barao the unify,

632
00:28:18,101 --> 00:28:23,101
the title barrel had a,
they had a crown in the interim 

633
00:28:23,101 --> 00:28:25,711
champion.
So hennen and Michael Mcdonald went 

634
00:28:25,711 --> 00:28:25,711
after it.
Great fight.

635
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:28,030
And Hanan Barao became the interim 
champion.

636
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:32,050
And now because he's the interim 
champion or is it?

637
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:33,930
No,
what did he win the title from?

638
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:35,110
Wow.
Am I wrong about that?

639
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:40,350
I might be wrong about that.
But Michael Mcdonald challenge for the 

640
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:44,041
title.
I think brow beat somebody else for the 

641
00:28:44,041 --> 00:28:44,041
title.
But Anyway,

642
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:46,750
um,
the uh,

643
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:51,760
the instances of guys getting their 
knees reconstructed and blowing them out

644
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:54,340
again is real high.
It's the same knee,

645
00:28:54,670 --> 00:28:57,220
same knee or the other knee.
I've had both my knees reconstructed.

646
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:59,830
Derek rose,
I don't know if you follow basketball.

647
00:29:00,370 --> 00:29:05,370
He blew out his left knee.
He is on the bowls that he's a million 

648
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:08,740
dollar $100,000,000
player and he blew out his knee.

649
00:29:08,990 --> 00:29:11,710
His,
I guess his left one of his knees and he

650
00:29:11,711 --> 00:29:16,711
took a year off and people gave them a 
hard time because people do come back 

651
00:29:16,711 --> 00:29:17,770
actually after nine or 10 months with an
acl.

652
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:23,040
And he didn't come back and then he came
back this year and he was playing and he

653
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:26,880
did the same thing to his other knee.
He,

654
00:29:26,881 --> 00:29:27,210
um,
um,

655
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:31,130
I was helen burroughs incorrect.
He defended against Michael Mcdonald.

656
00:29:31,131 --> 00:29:33,680
He won the title with the decision over 
Uriah Faber.

657
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:38,980
I should've known that.
That was way back in January or July of 

658
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:41,711
2012.
So Dominick Cruz had been rehabbing all 

659
00:29:41,711 --> 00:29:45,491
this time,
sitting on the sidelines even before 

660
00:29:45,491 --> 00:29:46,540
then because they had to come up with an
interim title back then.

661
00:29:46,990 --> 00:29:48,760
The poor guy has been out for two whole 
years.

662
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:51,640
It's crazy due to these knee issue knee 
issues,

663
00:29:51,641 --> 00:29:54,700
man.
And with him it's very important because

664
00:29:54,701 --> 00:29:59,701
his style,
he's probably got the most elaborate 

665
00:29:59,701 --> 00:30:02,161
footwork style in all of mma.
The dude is tireless and he goes five 

666
00:30:02,501 --> 00:30:07,501
rounds of constant moving.
It's one of the problems with fighting 

667
00:30:07,501 --> 00:30:07,501
him.
He's never there.

668
00:30:07,501 --> 00:30:07,501
He's like a willow.
The wisp,

669
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:08,470
you know,
his,

670
00:30:08,471 --> 00:30:13,471
his footwork is spectacular.
So a guy who was coming back from 

671
00:30:13,471 --> 00:30:17,460
essentially two significant operations 
to his knee and two years on the shelf 

672
00:30:17,770 --> 00:30:19,270
and he's got that crazy style.

673
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:20,380
But you know,
knees,

674
00:30:20,381 --> 00:30:25,381
you're hearing guys like coby Brian,
go into Germany and getting some of 

675
00:30:25,541 --> 00:30:30,541
that.
Whatever they do in Germany I had done 

676
00:30:30,541 --> 00:30:30,860
here in America,
it's called Regina keen ahead,

677
00:30:30,861 --> 00:30:32,170
head and neck.
It's fantastic.

678
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:34,330
It does work.
It's amazing what a,

679
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:39,400
what's it's called Magento keen or Ortho
keen and in Germany,

680
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:41,380
um,
Magento kind,

681
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:42,370
keen,
whatever the fuck it is,

682
00:30:42,371 --> 00:30:44,440
they take your blood out.
It took a lot of it,

683
00:30:44,441 --> 00:30:47,770
like almost a leader.
And then they expose it to environmental

684
00:30:47,771 --> 00:30:51,000
factors and spinning it in a centrifuge.
Doing that.

685
00:30:51,001 --> 00:30:54,040
It produces this reaction to the heat 
that they expose it to.

686
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:59,400
Produces this yellow liquid,
which is the most potent anti 

687
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,120
inflammatory drug known to man produced 
by your own body,

688
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:02,650
your own body.
Cool.

689
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:08,040
So it's amazing stuff and they now do it
in Santa Monica that they do it in 

690
00:31:08,741 --> 00:31:09,190
Dallas.

691
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,920
Excuse me.
They do it at a couple different,

692
00:31:11,921 --> 00:31:16,921
I think they do in Vegas now as well.
But fighters are experienced miraculous 

693
00:31:16,921 --> 00:31:19,000
results with us and know Chris Weidman 
hadn't done on his knees.

694
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:24,040
A lot of different fighters are getting 
it done and different parts of their 

695
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:24,040
body,
their backs especially,

696
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,600
so they're waiting to their injured to 
do it.

697
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:26,740
Oh yeah.
It does no benefit.

698
00:31:26,741 --> 00:31:28,990
If you were an injured,
it's just anti inflammatory,

699
00:31:29,290 --> 00:31:34,290
so don't take it unless you are hurt,
but the people who are hurt like elbow 

700
00:31:34,511 --> 00:31:35,650
injuries,
sore elbow,

701
00:31:35,651 --> 00:31:40,651
sore knees,
experience profound changes because of 

702
00:31:40,651 --> 00:31:41,290
this.
It's really amazing and it's healthy.

703
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:42,460
Oh,
it's totally healthy.

704
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:45,490
It's your blood.
It's your own body.

705
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:47,410
There's nothing dangerous about it 
whatsoever,

706
00:31:47,411 --> 00:31:52,411
but what's really fascinating is that 
these guys are figuring out all these 

707
00:31:52,411 --> 00:31:53,650
different ways to get your body to heal 
itself.

708
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:55,240
I mean,
that's essentially what they're doing.

709
00:31:55,240 --> 00:32:00,240
They're reintroducing your body's own 
anti inflammatory response to get it to 

710
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,510
fix itself.
That's amazing,

711
00:32:01,511 --> 00:32:02,130
man.
That's,

712
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:03,750
that's like,
that's really like,

713
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,660
that's incredible shit and they're.
They're doing this now.

714
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:08,860
What are they going to have in two 
years?

715
00:32:08,861 --> 00:32:10,030
What are they going to have in five 
years?

716
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:12,720
You know,
but will they have because they're going

717
00:32:12,721 --> 00:32:15,270
to have.
I think within our lifetimes we're going

718
00:32:15,271 --> 00:32:20,271
to see genetic genetic manipulation to 
the point where they can alter your 

719
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:20,271
frame.
I mean,

720
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:22,390
you're hearing that kind of stuff.
I mean,

721
00:32:22,391 --> 00:32:25,780
hgh for example,
that is available to the public.

722
00:32:26,170 --> 00:32:27,190
No,
it's not.

723
00:32:27,191 --> 00:32:28,450
No,
you can get.

724
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:31,840
There's certain companies that are 
starting to make.

725
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:34,420
It's called secretagogue.
It's,

726
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:34,980
it's,
uh,

727
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:39,160
an hgh that is um,
without.

728
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:44,420
I don't even know if you'd have to get a
doctor's prescription because what it 

729
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:46,871
does is it stimulates your body's own 
production of hgh using a certain 

730
00:32:46,871 --> 00:32:49,820
combination of amino acids and minerals 
and you can,

731
00:32:49,850 --> 00:32:53,060
you can definitely stimulate the growth 
of it with amino acids.

732
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:58,060
That's pretty much been proven that you 
could raise your levels significantly 

733
00:32:58,060 --> 00:33:02,230
where you could see it will show up 
several percent and that you would get 

734
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:06,461
benefit out of that.
But as far as like real human growth 

735
00:33:06,461 --> 00:33:09,251
hormone,
now Sarah is so tropin and that kind of 

736
00:33:09,251 --> 00:33:09,251
stuff,
you have to get it from a doctor.

737
00:33:09,251 --> 00:33:11,450
Okay.
So it is available that's prescribed and

738
00:33:11,451 --> 00:33:13,270
most sports it's illegal.
Okay.

739
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:18,490
So it's prescribed and I know they have 
these one anti aging clinics in Florida 

740
00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:20,330
and the guy's gotten exactly.
That's where these guys go.

741
00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:23,600
Is that good for you?
And is that,

742
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:28,250
is that something that people take and 
what's not a blank statement?

743
00:33:28,251 --> 00:33:30,140
Is Salt good for you?
Yes.

744
00:33:30,170 --> 00:33:32,750
Salts.
But if you need a pound,

745
00:33:32,751 --> 00:33:33,670
you're dead.
Right?

746
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:38,740
So you know by asking his hgh or human 
growth hormone and testosterone and at 

747
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:40,250
these doses,
yes,

748
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:42,650
if you're doing it correctly,
yes it is good for you.

749
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:45,290
But it also improves performance without
a doubt.

750
00:33:45,530 --> 00:33:50,530
And the question is should you be 
allowed to do that and compete in 

751
00:33:50,530 --> 00:33:50,990
sports?
I don't know.

752
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:56,280
You know,
there's like a big argument with that 

753
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:58,090
right now in fighting because of 
testosterone use exemptions and it's a 

754
00:33:58,131 --> 00:34:01,160
very controversial subject with a lot of
different opinions on both sides.

755
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:06,490
And there's fighters that are taking 
testosterone and it helps them recover 

756
00:34:06,490 --> 00:34:07,010
and it's so it's,
you know,

757
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:08,960
it definitely is good for you.
If you take it,

758
00:34:08,961 --> 00:34:13,961
it'll definitely help you recover.
But what's the difference between you 

759
00:34:13,961 --> 00:34:17,321
taking it,
you recovering quicker and a guy who 

760
00:34:17,321 --> 00:34:17,480
might have the same levels as you and 
doesn't take anything.

761
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:19,580
And when you're,
when you're training all the time,

762
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:24,630
your body gets beaten down and your body
has naturally low levels because you're 

763
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:28,451
pushing it to the limit.
You're trying to get your body to 

764
00:34:28,451 --> 00:34:28,451
respond.

765
00:34:28,451 --> 00:34:28,451
You have to make sure you sleep 10 
hours,

766
00:34:28,451 --> 00:34:30,120
12 hours a night.
You got to make sure you drink shit,

767
00:34:30,121 --> 00:34:35,121
loads of water.
You got to make sure your nutrition is 

768
00:34:35,121 --> 00:34:35,930
on point super clean.
And if you do all those things,

769
00:34:35,931 --> 00:34:38,270
you can maximize your hormone levels 
naturally.

770
00:34:38,271 --> 00:34:39,560
If you're a young,
healthy man.

771
00:34:39,890 --> 00:34:42,200
But if you don't do that,
if you don't get the right sleep,

772
00:34:42,201 --> 00:34:44,030
if you're stressed out,
if you don't eat right,

773
00:34:44,031 --> 00:34:47,120
if you overtrain,
you could easily show low levels.

774
00:34:47,121 --> 00:34:49,010
You go to a doctor and the doctor says,
well,

775
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:54,360
you've got low testosterone sunrail and 
give you a testosterone use exemption 

776
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,400
and you'll be better than ever.
You will be better than ever.

777
00:34:55,430 --> 00:34:58,850
That's true.
But the question becomes when is it,

778
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:01,700
when should it be illegal?
And then where do we stop?

779
00:35:01,730 --> 00:35:06,730
Because there's a lot of testosterone's,
a testosterone supplements that you can 

780
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:07,640
take that are natural over the counter 
stuff.

781
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:12,640
There's a lot of different ingredients 
and testosterone boosters that has been 

782
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:16,781
shown to have fairly significant 
increases in your body's ability to 

783
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:17,090
produce testosterone.
I'd start with that.

784
00:35:17,330 --> 00:35:19,550
Yeah,
but the problem is where does it end?

785
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:22,190
Is my point.
If you make testosterone illegal,

786
00:35:22,191 --> 00:35:22,790
if you say,
okay,

787
00:35:22,791 --> 00:35:25,490
a guy can't take tests,
can you take creatine?

788
00:35:25,970 --> 00:35:27,380
Kenny,
take amino acids.

789
00:35:27,410 --> 00:35:30,920
Can you take vitamins?
Can he take a bunch of things outside?

790
00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:33,440
They're not going to go back,
are they?

791
00:35:33,470 --> 00:35:34,640
I don't know.
You tell me.

792
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:36,530
I don't think so.
But why not?

793
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:39,270
When things are improving,
if things are helping,

794
00:35:39,271 --> 00:35:41,400
they're helping.
And if it's testosterone,

795
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:43,140
what about vitamin B?
12.

796
00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:44,790
That's legal,
right?

797
00:35:44,791 --> 00:35:49,791
Yes.
But can you take it in an intramuscular 

798
00:35:49,791 --> 00:35:51,771
shot?
Because that really increases 

799
00:35:51,771 --> 00:35:51,771
performance.
Can you know?

800
00:35:51,771 --> 00:35:51,771
Yes,
you can.

801
00:35:51,771 --> 00:35:52,410
Okay.
But why should you be able to?

802
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:56,130
Why should you be able to take vitamin B
12 and you can't take testosterone.

803
00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:01,160
Why should you be able to take 
testosterone if you can't take some 

804
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:03,501
synthetic thing that someone creates?
It turns you into a fucking super freak 

805
00:36:03,501 --> 00:36:04,050
it.
The real question becomes,

806
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:07,050
where do we draw the line as far as how 
much you much.

807
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:12,470
This is what I think.
I think there's going to be a point in 

808
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:15,081
time where it's like the Internet,
like if one point in time when they 

809
00:36:15,081 --> 00:36:18,501
first created the Internet,
you might have been able to keep a porn 

810
00:36:18,501 --> 00:36:18,570
site off,
but at this point it's a joke.

811
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:23,720
It's just out there.
There's no way you're going to stop 

812
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:23,720
people from seeing naked people if they 
go.

813
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:28,230
If they go online and they're curious,
they're going to find what they're 

814
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:30,711
looking for us.
I think we're going to have in just 

815
00:36:30,711 --> 00:36:32,700
everyday life,
so many options to enhance your body.

816
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:37,880
I think it's going to be staggering and 
I think the idea of a natural athlete 

817
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:38,340
100 years from now is going to be a 
joke.

818
00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:43,610
I don't think there's going to be any 
and I don't do it in bodybuilding right 

819
00:36:43,610 --> 00:36:43,610
now.
What does that mean?

820
00:36:43,610 --> 00:36:46,410
They have guys who do steroids and they 
have guys who do natural.

821
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:49,710
No,
they have guys who claim to be natural,

822
00:36:49,711 --> 00:36:51,960
but there's a lot of those guys used to 
do steroids.

823
00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:53,790
Okay.
And then they stopped doing steroids and

824
00:36:53,791 --> 00:36:56,970
now they do natural and they've gotten 
significant benefits because of that.

825
00:36:57,090 --> 00:36:59,700
Like a friend of mine got into,
he was a natural bodybuilder and quotes.

826
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:03,150
He was actually natural and you got in a
big argument with one of those guys,

827
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:05,220
you know,
the guy was fucking huge.

828
00:37:05,221 --> 00:37:08,430
He said the guy was ripped and strike at
it and the guy did Roy.

829
00:37:08,431 --> 00:37:11,160
It's for like a long time,
but now he's clean and he's like,

830
00:37:11,161 --> 00:37:12,750
so like you,
you did.

831
00:37:12,810 --> 00:37:15,210
You got all this from steroids.

832
00:37:15,470 --> 00:37:17,160
Like you don't look like a regular 
person.

833
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:18,780
You're,
you're huge.

834
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:23,960
That came from steroids.
You just figured out how to keep it 

835
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,971
naturally.
But the benefits all came from doing 

836
00:37:25,971 --> 00:37:25,971
steroids.
I could see that.

837
00:37:25,971 --> 00:37:26,220
I mean,
I,

838
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:30,360
I guess most of those guys may have been
former steroid users.

839
00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:32,610
A lot of them I,
I'd have to study up on.

840
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:34,260
Well,
I think when you're dealing with a sport

841
00:37:34,261 --> 00:37:39,261
that essentially requires that at the 
professional level in bodybuilding 

842
00:37:39,261 --> 00:37:40,860
require steroids at the professional 
level,

843
00:37:41,310 --> 00:37:42,410
probably they,
you know,

844
00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:44,910
they probably do in football,
unfortunately.

845
00:37:44,911 --> 00:37:48,270
I'm maybe basketball.
I think you could get by and football if

846
00:37:48,271 --> 00:37:50,910
you're some sort of Ray Lewis,
super athlete type dude,

847
00:37:50,970 --> 00:37:53,700
I think you can get by naturally.
I don't know,

848
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:55,300
it's just,
it's hard.

849
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:58,140
Your speculation on my part.
I have zero experience in football,

850
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:01,710
but I do know some giant dudes who were 
just naturally giant,

851
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:04,170
but you can't get giant like bodybuilder
giant.

852
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:07,470
Get that big.
That's not a natural look.

853
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:10,560
That's through synthetics only one way.
There's only one way.

854
00:38:10,561 --> 00:38:12,050
You can't do it any other way.
I don't.

855
00:38:12,210 --> 00:38:14,100
I literally don't even think it's 
possible.

856
00:38:15,870 --> 00:38:19,320
I don't want to be that way.
I just want to want to look a little fit

857
00:38:19,470 --> 00:38:21,120
will little fit,
you know?

858
00:38:21,121 --> 00:38:23,010
I think that's good.
You know,

859
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:28,070
I stay away from a lot of the 
supplements because I feel like some of 

860
00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:30,000
them get me going too much.
In what way?

861
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:32,400
I'm not saying any of these.
Uh,

862
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:35,250
I think if I was to take a testosterone,

863
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:41,010
I don't think it would be good for me.
You think you would have a problem 

864
00:38:41,010 --> 00:38:43,651
keeping it together?
Maybe I'd have to start off slow.

865
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:48,420
Maybe it'd be good for you and maybe 
part of what's making you a loose cannon

866
00:38:48,421 --> 00:38:50,140
and you don't have enough hormones in 
your system.

867
00:38:50,590 --> 00:38:52,960
I'm a loose cannon without it.
Without it.

868
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:54,940
You're just a loose cannon.
I actually,

869
00:38:54,941 --> 00:38:56,830
I'm not a loose cannon.
I.

870
00:38:56,830 --> 00:38:57,210
Holy Cow.
I'm not.

871
00:38:57,250 --> 00:38:58,400
Some people think I am,
but uh,

872
00:38:58,401 --> 00:38:59,400
no.
I'm not a loose cannon.

873
00:38:59,410 --> 00:39:04,410
I take twitter.
Outrage or outburst is not a loose 

874
00:39:04,410 --> 00:39:07,411
cannon.
Make that happen of manic behavior on 

875
00:39:07,411 --> 00:39:11,851
twitter.
Are you talking about recently or 

876
00:39:11,851 --> 00:39:11,851
before?
For.

877
00:39:11,851 --> 00:39:11,851
Yeah,
it happened,

878
00:39:11,851 --> 00:39:13,510
but something happened recently.
Only recently.

879
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:14,930
I,
I know I.

880
00:39:14,930 --> 00:39:15,220
No,
no,

881
00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:16,560
it was just I was,
I,

882
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:21,640
like I said,
I gave myself that 72 hours because the 

883
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:25,090
premier of the show was coming out and I
knew just.

884
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:28,510
I'm not even talking about whatever 
comes next regarding that.

885
00:39:28,511 --> 00:39:33,511
When you say you gave yourself 72 hours,
we're going way back to the earlier 

886
00:39:33,511 --> 00:39:37,621
conversation.
When you're talking about your hat and 

887
00:39:37,621 --> 00:39:37,621
your wacky attire.
Yes.

888
00:39:37,621 --> 00:39:41,010
Okay.
So what you're saying is connected to 

889
00:39:41,010 --> 00:39:41,010
it.
Okay.

890
00:39:41,010 --> 00:39:41,010
What you're saying?
Totally confused.

891
00:39:41,010 --> 00:39:42,130
So let me,
and I'm sure other people are as well,

892
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:44,110
so I don't think they are for sure they 
are.

893
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:47,020
If I am,
I'm not unique in that respect.

894
00:39:47,290 --> 00:39:52,290
So what you're saying is you get wacky 
like 72 hours between like a day and 

895
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:57,900
half before,
day and a half after to sort of promote 

896
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:57,900
it.
There's some of that.

897
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:59,770
Yes,
there are some of that.

898
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:04,800
Yes.
So I would say for when I say 72 hours,

899
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:10,920
I'm talking about this past Saturday,
Sunday and then Monday part of Monday.

900
00:40:15,910 --> 00:40:20,910
Right.
I get to not gloat but kinda like feel 

901
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:20,910
good about it.

902
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:24,610
Say thank you to everybody.
Gavi,

903
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,500
emotion.
Some tears.

904
00:40:26,501 --> 00:40:28,990
Like this is a,
it was a big moment for me.

905
00:40:28,991 --> 00:40:33,991
Like I said,
it doesn't matter what happens after 

906
00:40:33,991 --> 00:40:34,570
this.
I don't have to be in another movie.

907
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:37,190
I don't think.
I'm not even a.

908
00:40:37,210 --> 00:40:40,330
my inspiration is not to do the brody 
move.

909
00:40:40,331 --> 00:40:44,500
He like Woody Allen or the Brody Sitcom.
I feel like,

910
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:45,860
you know what,
that,

911
00:40:45,870 --> 00:40:50,870
that first and second episode I got 
enough positivity and stress relieving a

912
00:40:54,551 --> 00:40:59,080
emotions out of it to where I'm good and
I kinda,

913
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:03,370
I kinda had an outside feeling going in 
that might happen.

914
00:41:03,371 --> 00:41:08,371
So in my head I gave myself 72 hours.
So a lot of it before was,

915
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:10,540
you know,
thank you.

916
00:41:10,541 --> 00:41:15,541
Thank you to everybody and after this 
I'm going to not have to explain myself.

917
00:41:16,930 --> 00:41:18,310
I don't have to be.
I'm brody,

918
00:41:18,311 --> 00:41:19,960
I do this.
Why are you not laughing?

919
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:25,140
I get to like stay in the stage onstage.
Like you'll get your crowd to come see 

920
00:41:26,321 --> 00:41:27,760
you.
They'll understand your sense of humor.

921
00:41:27,761 --> 00:41:32,761
So what you're saying,
I think a little bit of that and I also 

922
00:41:32,761 --> 00:41:34,430
think maybe creatively in a professional

923
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:36,500
situation,
I'm not going to have to.

924
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:38,890
I mean I'm a.
I'm not a me,

925
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:39,920
me,
me guy.

926
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:41,570
Wha Wha wha wha.
Whoa.

927
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:44,510
What'd you just say?
What the fuck did you just say?

928
00:41:44,511 --> 00:41:45,450
You said you're not a me,
me,

929
00:41:45,451 --> 00:41:46,430
me.
I'm not.

930
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:49,250
Okay Joe,
I've done 2,500

931
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:51,330
audience warmups.
How could I be a meme?

932
00:41:51,450 --> 00:41:51,990
Miga?
Well,

933
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,530
just in every time we have a 
conversation that comes back to me,

934
00:41:54,531 --> 00:41:55,010
me,
me,

935
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,900
well,
maybe I was in that situation.

936
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,850
I know that we could go off to the 
deepest,

937
00:41:58,851 --> 00:42:01,130
darkest recesses of space and you would 
go,

938
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:05,450
I guarantee you I'm not really into 
space ever since I was a kid,

939
00:42:05,451 --> 00:42:07,310
baseball was my thing and you'll just 
turn it.

940
00:42:07,311 --> 00:42:10,700
Would you say since the beginning of 
this podcast today,

941
00:42:10,701 --> 00:42:14,000
I've been in a good frame of mind.
Positive or listening?

942
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:17,330
Yeah,
because I know I kind of.

943
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:19,760
I don't have to.

944
00:42:19,790 --> 00:42:23,150
Not necessarily to you.
I never had to explain myself to you.

945
00:42:23,151 --> 00:42:28,151
Bringing it back to you again,
will you never know what you're doing is

946
00:42:28,231 --> 00:42:29,160
you're on this.
Oh,

947
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:34,500
I never.
I never felt I had explained myself to 

948
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:37,370
you.
I felt at times I had to explain myself 

949
00:42:37,370 --> 00:42:37,370
to others.
Those people,

950
00:42:37,370 --> 00:42:42,100
those people don't understand comics.
That's relieves stress for me and I 

951
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:46,661
think that relieving of stress,
it's kind of carried over to maybe our 

952
00:42:46,661 --> 00:42:50,081
relationship here today and other things
I've done and our relationship here 

953
00:42:50,691 --> 00:42:55,691
today is different than our relationship
for the past decade or so that we've 

954
00:42:55,691 --> 00:42:57,230
known each other.
I feel more relaxed and that's not.

955
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:59,630
That's not you.
That's what you're saying.

956
00:42:59,631 --> 00:43:01,580
So you feel like because of your 
success,

957
00:43:01,581 --> 00:43:03,440
you've.
It's alleviated some pressure,

958
00:43:03,441 --> 00:43:08,441
you feel more better about the future 
and it's allowed you and enhanced you in

959
00:43:08,481 --> 00:43:09,470
all of your dealings.

960
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:14,740
Essentially for the 72 hour period.
It's allowed me to gloat a little bit.

961
00:43:16,550 --> 00:43:19,700
You don't need the glow,
but now I know you're going to say that.

962
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:20,960
Joe,
how'd you know?

963
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:23,240
Because you know me.
I know you.

964
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:26,090
My path is a little different than 
yours.

965
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:29,420
Your past path is unique.
Brian's path is unique.

966
00:43:29,421 --> 00:43:31,370
Everybody's path.
Is it unique?

967
00:43:31,430 --> 00:43:35,420
Okay.
If you could file Brian home the GPS and

968
00:43:35,421 --> 00:43:36,560
be like,
what the fuck are you doing?

969
00:43:36,561 --> 00:43:38,060
It's five in the morning,
go home.

970
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:43,010
So for that I gave myself 72 hours to 
party.

971
00:43:43,310 --> 00:43:45,230
If you talk about 72 hours,
one more time,

972
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:46,640
we're going to lose everyone listening 
to this.

973
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:48,580
Why didn't you say that?
Because it's true.

974
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:50,960
Three days.
People are people are there enough right

975
00:43:50,961 --> 00:43:53,000
now.
They're filled up with 72 hours.

976
00:43:53,001 --> 00:43:53,690
Then they're like,
well,

977
00:43:53,691 --> 00:43:56,060
this guy shut the fuck up.
About a 72 hours.

978
00:43:56,120 --> 00:44:01,120
I don't think so.
We just brought up the fact that he 

979
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:01,120
brings it back to himself.
What does he do?

980
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:04,100
He's back to his 72 hours to watch.
I'm going to say so uncontrolled today.

981
00:44:04,190 --> 00:44:06,320
Thank God you don't have a job.
You ever think about that buddy,

982
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:09,140
that you've made it this far without 
accent mean you've had some warmup gigs,

983
00:44:09,290 --> 00:44:12,020
but not a job job.
We have to show up at a fucking office.

984
00:44:12,021 --> 00:44:13,070
I've been lucky.
Asshole.

985
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:15,290
Did you see this lawsuit that's going on
right now?

986
00:44:15,470 --> 00:44:16,250
Where this,
uh,

987
00:44:16,490 --> 00:44:19,880
this CEO of this,
it's actually pretty funny.

988
00:44:20,090 --> 00:44:25,090
The CEO of Archie comics allegedly would
call all the men that worked the office 

989
00:44:25,090 --> 00:44:29,981
penises.
She called everyone penises and she 

990
00:44:29,981 --> 00:44:32,921
would like.
She would have these rants where she 

991
00:44:32,921 --> 00:44:32,921
would scream,

992
00:44:32,921 --> 00:44:33,030
penis,
penis,

993
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:38,060
penis in the staff meetings,
so these guys are suing her.

994
00:44:38,730 --> 00:44:43,730
She's being sued for gender 
discrimination and she says that the 

995
00:44:43,730 --> 00:44:48,081
suit is baseless.
She can't be guilty of gender 

996
00:44:48,081 --> 00:44:51,381
discrimination against employees because
white males aren't a protective class.

997
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:55,830
They aren't a protected class.
That's hilarious.

998
00:44:55,890 --> 00:44:58,710
She's saying that white males don't 
deserve protection,

999
00:44:59,010 --> 00:45:04,010
so she might be a feminist,
but saying that she could just yell out 

1000
00:45:04,711 --> 00:45:08,850
sexual discrimination from a position of
power being the CEO of a company,

1001
00:45:09,390 --> 00:45:13,680
terrify her male workers,
but because they're white men,

1002
00:45:13,681 --> 00:45:17,970
they can't say shit.
That is he see thinking,

1003
00:45:17,971 --> 00:45:22,971
run a muck.
That is the very problem with stopping 

1004
00:45:22,971 --> 00:45:24,360
jokes and censorship and all this rape 
culture bullshit.

1005
00:45:24,510 --> 00:45:28,980
That's the very problem unequal thinking
across the board.

1006
00:45:29,030 --> 00:45:32,460
Whereas non guilty people are guilty.
Do you think she may be doing on purpose

1007
00:45:32,461 --> 00:45:34,380
as a joke because it is archie comics 
and said,

1008
00:45:34,510 --> 00:45:36,840
you know how many people are probably 
picking up an archie comic now?

1009
00:45:37,430 --> 00:45:39,720
Brian is probably the best thing you 
could ever do.

1010
00:45:39,721 --> 00:45:42,150
If you want to sell archie comics,
who buys those fucking things?

1011
00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:43,260
I mean,
I would.

1012
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:45,690
I would say that would be brilliant if 
that's the case,

1013
00:45:45,810 --> 00:45:48,870
but if it's not the case,
she's just another asshole boss.

1014
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:53,960
You know,
being a boss of a group of men was 

1015
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:54,330
probably really frustrating.
Anyway.

1016
00:45:54,331 --> 00:45:55,530
If you're a woman,
you know,

1017
00:45:55,531 --> 00:46:00,531
especially if any of them are like 
average men for Dick heads that don't 

1018
00:46:00,531 --> 00:46:01,590
want to listen to a woman,
it's probably a disaster.

1019
00:46:01,770 --> 00:46:06,770
So how does she respond to that?
She's fucking screams at him called 

1020
00:46:06,770 --> 00:46:06,770
cosmo penis.
It's actually kind of brilliant.

1021
00:46:07,470 --> 00:46:11,150
But this is.
This is such ass backwards thinking that

1022
00:46:11,151 --> 00:46:16,151
like the demonizing of innocent white 
males has gotten to a point,

1023
00:46:16,261 --> 00:46:21,261
and I don't want to Belabor this because
I know white males have it easier than 

1024
00:46:21,261 --> 00:46:21,261
anybody in this society.

1025
00:46:21,261 --> 00:46:25,670
There's no doubt about that,
but just the fact that anybody thinks 

1026
00:46:25,670 --> 00:46:26,520
that they can say that,
that she can't be guilty of gender,

1027
00:46:26,540 --> 00:46:31,540
gender discrimination against employees 
because white males aren't a protected 

1028
00:46:31,540 --> 00:46:34,341
class.
So what she's inferring is that white 

1029
00:46:34,341 --> 00:46:35,280
males have like,
they have a surplus,

1030
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:39,090
you have a like a bunch of like get out 
of trouble,

1031
00:46:39,091 --> 00:46:42,210
free cars throughout your whole life.
So because of that you,

1032
00:46:42,211 --> 00:46:44,190
oh,
so she can shit on you,

1033
00:46:44,191 --> 00:46:46,080
ruin your life,
ruined your day,

1034
00:46:46,081 --> 00:46:49,530
call you a penis at work,
do whatever the fuck she wants to do,

1035
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:53,880
and you have no recourse.
That's absolutely brilliant.

1036
00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:55,890
It's hilarious.
There's,

1037
00:46:56,090 --> 00:46:58,620
there's assholes in the world,
no doubt about it.

1038
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:00,290
There's,
there's racists,

1039
00:47:00,291 --> 00:47:02,430
there's homophobes,
there's massage,

1040
00:47:02,730 --> 00:47:06,060
there's missing dri,
there's people that hate men.

1041
00:47:06,061 --> 00:47:08,220
There's people that hate women.
There's no doubt about it.

1042
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:11,880
But when you have someone who's yelling 
out like penis,

1043
00:47:11,881 --> 00:47:12,510
penis,
penis,

1044
00:47:12,750 --> 00:47:16,920
either it's funny or they're an asshole 
and you don't know unless you're there.

1045
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:19,590
And I would imagine that these guys went
out of their way.

1046
00:47:19,591 --> 00:47:21,930
They work at a fucking comics place,
allegedly.

1047
00:47:21,931 --> 00:47:26,931
They have senses of humor.
If they went that far out of their way 

1048
00:47:26,931 --> 00:47:29,860
to file a fucking lawsuit,
that must be a disastrous to work.

1049
00:47:31,150 --> 00:47:32,230
Our sheets,
comics,

1050
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:37,450
the accusations are extremely damaging 
to myself and archie comics.

1051
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:38,770
Archie comics,
to me,

1052
00:47:38,771 --> 00:47:41,530
stands for high values that are global 
values.

1053
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:43,030
Okay.
I hate her already.

1054
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:47,310
I hate anybody who would say that.
Archie comics stands for high values,

1055
00:47:47,311 --> 00:47:50,500
their global values.
What the fuck does that mean?

1056
00:47:51,510 --> 00:47:54,580
There was a nice message because of our 
global values.

1057
00:47:54,610 --> 00:47:59,610
She is rarely even in the office.
I go around the world to promote archie 

1058
00:47:59,610 --> 00:47:59,610
comic.
She told the Daily News.

1059
00:47:59,610 --> 00:48:02,800
That's what I do.
According to the employee suit,

1060
00:48:02,801 --> 00:48:07,390
she also invites Hell's angels into the 
office to intimidate employees.

1061
00:48:07,930 --> 00:48:09,100
Again,
this isn't real.

1062
00:48:09,250 --> 00:48:11,410
This is not off the onion.
No,

1063
00:48:11,420 --> 00:48:14,140
it's all raw story,
which is a real legit website.

1064
00:48:14,590 --> 00:48:19,590
Frequently in Qa inquires about the 
location of a handgun and 750 rounds of 

1065
00:48:19,751 --> 00:48:24,751
ammunition.
She believes her late husband kept in 

1066
00:48:24,751 --> 00:48:24,751
the office.
This sounds like horseshit.

1067
00:48:24,770 --> 00:48:27,610
Well,
she's got a 47 followers on twitter.

1068
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:29,590
Hala.
It's probably all from today,

1069
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:33,220
from this raw story in 2011.
The other CEO,

1070
00:48:33,221 --> 00:48:38,221
Jonathan Gold,
while they're file a suit against her 

1071
00:48:38,221 --> 00:48:38,830
claiming that she is unstable and 
bankrupting the company.

1072
00:48:38,831 --> 00:48:41,950
The case was settled with the parties 
agreeing to hire a go.

1073
00:48:41,951 --> 00:48:46,330
Between Samuel Levitan to facilitate 
communication between this chick and her

1074
00:48:46,331 --> 00:48:47,740
employees.
However,

1075
00:48:47,741 --> 00:48:52,741
earlier this year the go-between filed a
lawsuit against her claiming that she 

1076
00:48:52,741 --> 00:48:55,510
had become unhinged and that she needed 
to be removed.

1077
00:48:56,260 --> 00:48:57,910
I love this lady.
Oh,

1078
00:48:57,911 --> 00:49:01,090
you like these are reality show.
Be Great.

1079
00:49:01,150 --> 00:49:06,150
Give it.
Just give her an office full of fucking 

1080
00:49:06,150 --> 00:49:06,150
slumpy like doofus.

1081
00:49:06,150 --> 00:49:07,600
He dudes that she could fucking scream 
at.

1082
00:49:07,630 --> 00:49:10,650
So you blame the guys for being weak and
not standing up to her.

1083
00:49:10,690 --> 00:49:12,160
No,
they have a job.

1084
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:13,720
She's an asshole obviously.
Just.

1085
00:49:13,820 --> 00:49:14,500
Well,
I don't know.

1086
00:49:14,590 --> 00:49:19,590
I don't know what she's really like.
Maybe if I worked there and yelled at 

1087
00:49:19,590 --> 00:49:19,590
people,
I'm,

1088
00:49:19,590 --> 00:49:20,170
I was there.
You bring it back to yourself again.

1089
00:49:20,350 --> 00:49:22,630
Maybe if I was there,
I didn't even do that.

1090
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:24,910
We have.
If I was there,

1091
00:49:24,911 --> 00:49:25,900
I would think,
you know,

1092
00:49:25,901 --> 00:49:27,370
hey,
you know these,

1093
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:28,930
these people don't have a sense of 
humor,

1094
00:49:28,931 --> 00:49:29,920
man.
She's awesome.

1095
00:49:30,250 --> 00:49:32,170
Maybe I would think that it's everybody 
else.

1096
00:49:32,230 --> 00:49:34,180
I would have to be there to make that 
judgment call,

1097
00:49:34,390 --> 00:49:36,640
but looking at this,
it sounds pretty crazy.

1098
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:38,050
Bitch.
Sounds nuts.

1099
00:49:38,270 --> 00:49:43,270
She's pretty hell's angels into the 
office to intimidate the employees and 

1100
00:49:43,270 --> 00:49:47,341
frequently inquires about the location 
of a handgun at 750 rounds of 

1101
00:49:47,341 --> 00:49:47,341
ammunition.

1102
00:49:47,341 --> 00:49:50,170
Like what the fuck that Shit happen?
Wouldn't you just go with it?

1103
00:49:50,171 --> 00:49:51,970
And just like,
like if she called you a penis,

1104
00:49:51,971 --> 00:49:52,630
et Cetera,
you'd be like,

1105
00:49:52,631 --> 00:49:53,350
oh,
what kind,

1106
00:49:53,610 --> 00:49:58,610
you know,
like it seems like she's just an 

1107
00:49:58,610 --> 00:50:00,190
inviting to be able to throw things back
at her if she had a sense of humor.

1108
00:50:00,191 --> 00:50:01,600
But she's the boss man.
Yeah.

1109
00:50:01,601 --> 00:50:03,340
But she's saying she has that fucking 
guy and I'd be like,

1110
00:50:03,341 --> 00:50:05,020
Oh,
I can't joke about that.

1111
00:50:06,030 --> 00:50:11,030
It's not nice to joke about that.
But I think the position of a boss like 

1112
00:50:11,171 --> 00:50:15,820
that have a big office where everybody 
has like real strict behavior rules.

1113
00:50:16,090 --> 00:50:18,610
Like when you're in a big office like 
you,

1114
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:23,640
everybody's wearing like nice clothes.
They have to dress like they're in an 

1115
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:26,941
office.
They'll go in their cubicle or their 

1116
00:50:26,941 --> 00:50:28,040
offices and they get their work done.
It's like a very like buttoned down,

1117
00:50:28,041 --> 00:50:30,650
controlled,
restricted environment in most offices.

1118
00:50:31,010 --> 00:50:33,080
Someone running around yelling penis,
penis,

1119
00:50:33,081 --> 00:50:38,081
penis.
But if it's the boss and she's calling 

1120
00:50:38,081 --> 00:50:39,170
everybody penises,
that makes you feel like,

1121
00:50:39,171 --> 00:50:39,590
shit,

1122
00:50:39,910 --> 00:50:41,980
what country is this?
This is America.

1123
00:50:42,730 --> 00:50:44,860
This is in New York.
It's New York.

1124
00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:46,990
I,
I,

1125
00:50:46,991 --> 00:50:48,660
uh,
maybe she's saying peanuts.

1126
00:50:49,570 --> 00:50:52,300
No,
I can't.

1127
00:50:52,460 --> 00:50:55,210
I ain't trying to put a positive spin on
it.

1128
00:50:55,211 --> 00:50:56,590
Joe.
I didn't make it about me.

1129
00:50:56,650 --> 00:50:59,230
I don't think there's any positive spin 
to be had in this one.

1130
00:50:59,350 --> 00:51:00,090
I think.
Um,

1131
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:02,800
have you.
Have you seen pretty hilarious story.

1132
00:51:02,860 --> 00:51:05,080
Have you watched a birdies noosa yet?
Don't bring me.

1133
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:06,010
No,
I have no,

1134
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:07,810
don't bring me up actually.
Really good.

1135
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:09,460
Can we show you're in it,
by the way?

1136
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:11,020
Beautiful.
How about,

1137
00:51:11,021 --> 00:51:14,950
how did I get in it?
I had a red band sign your waiver.

1138
00:51:15,490 --> 00:51:16,000
Sweet.

1139
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:21,050
Hope it worked out.
He came into the ice house once.

1140
00:51:22,250 --> 00:51:24,040
You were good at it.
Thank you.

1141
00:51:24,970 --> 00:51:26,050
Thank you.
I mean that.

1142
00:51:26,230 --> 00:51:27,040
Oh No,
thank you.

1143
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:33,260
You know,
I wanted to come on here and say how Joe

1144
00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:36,760
was one of the first comedians.
I came up to me and said,

1145
00:51:36,761 --> 00:51:41,761
I was funny.
Like I believed that he was a guy who 

1146
00:51:41,761 --> 00:51:41,761
was working in various.
Yeah.

1147
00:51:41,761 --> 00:51:41,880
Well,
I,

1148
00:51:41,881 --> 00:51:44,320
I didn't believe that or feel it.
How come you didn't believe that?

1149
00:51:44,321 --> 00:51:45,730
I just didn't.
Why not?

1150
00:51:45,850 --> 00:51:47,200
I don't know.
I got my issues.

1151
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:49,030
But people were laughing.
You hear people laughing.

1152
00:51:49,180 --> 00:51:51,780
Yeah.
But for you to you.

1153
00:51:51,790 --> 00:51:56,790
For you,
you're one of the early comedians are 

1154
00:51:56,790 --> 00:51:58,930
2000 and say I'm funny.
You said I was funny and I believed it.

1155
00:51:58,931 --> 00:52:00,810
And then you,
you know,

1156
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:05,820
you brought me in to do the warmup of 
demand show and you were hilarious in 

1157
00:52:05,820 --> 00:52:05,820
that,
you know,

1158
00:52:05,820 --> 00:52:07,750
so that gave me a lot of confidence.

1159
00:52:07,830 --> 00:52:09,180
That's awesome.
That's good to hear man.

1160
00:52:09,181 --> 00:52:14,181
You know,
everybody gets that when you're coming 

1161
00:52:14,181 --> 00:52:14,520
up you get that boost from somebody that
you,

1162
00:52:14,521 --> 00:52:19,521
like.
Someone comes up to you and tells you 

1163
00:52:19,521 --> 00:52:19,521
that you're funny.
It's a great boost.

1164
00:52:19,521 --> 00:52:20,910
It can make.
I always credit mark Marin when I was an

1165
00:52:20,911 --> 00:52:25,170
open mic or Marin came up to me once and
he gave me a compliment and gave me some

1166
00:52:25,171 --> 00:52:26,490
advice and I was like,
wow.

1167
00:52:27,030 --> 00:52:32,030
For me it was like Holy Shit.
Like this is a guy like a professional 

1168
00:52:32,030 --> 00:52:33,080
and he's telling me I can do this.
You know,

1169
00:52:33,220 --> 00:52:38,220
it's very,
it's very inspirational when someone 

1170
00:52:38,220 --> 00:52:39,330
comes up to you and gives you some 
prompts,

1171
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:44,560
you know,
unless you know you're doing the right 

1172
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:44,560
thing.
Yeah.

1173
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:44,560
It feels like you maybe like,
don't know what the fuck.

1174
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:45,210
You know.
Everybody feels like beginning,

1175
00:52:45,211 --> 00:52:45,420
right?

1176
00:52:46,310 --> 00:52:51,310
Yeah.
It's nice when those little moments 

1177
00:52:51,310 --> 00:52:51,310
happen and keep working,
keep pushing.

1178
00:52:51,310 --> 00:52:53,120
You don't look for them.
Just keep going.

1179
00:52:53,121 --> 00:52:53,830
You're doing your.

1180
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:59,300
Yes.
One of the most exciting things about 

1181
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:01,041
life is when you trying to do something 
and you don't know if it's going to 

1182
00:53:01,041 --> 00:53:04,281
happen,
you don't know if it's gonna work out 

1183
00:53:04,281 --> 00:53:06,380
one of the most exciting things in life.
It's like trying to figure out how to 

1184
00:53:06,380 --> 00:53:07,290
make this so because even if you have 
confidence,

1185
00:53:07,740 --> 00:53:09,320
but how much confidence do you really 
have?

1186
00:53:09,321 --> 00:53:10,680
It hasn't happened yet.
You know,

1187
00:53:10,681 --> 00:53:14,580
you might have real confidence,
but it doesn't feel like a reality until

1188
00:53:14,581 --> 00:53:16,200
all of a sudden here,
brody,

1189
00:53:16,201 --> 00:53:18,690
here's your check for doing standup 
comedy and you're like,

1190
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:20,940
I'm a professional now.
Like legitimately,

1191
00:53:21,060 --> 00:53:22,230
and then here,
brody,

1192
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:25,020
you're on comedy central.
Now I like comedy central,

1193
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:29,190
like legitimately like it's you then.
Then you could feel it and see it,

1194
00:53:29,460 --> 00:53:30,600
but man,
those early days,

1195
00:53:30,601 --> 00:53:34,200
like the 2013 years ago today,
if you stop and think about it,

1196
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:36,570
you were a guy who is,
you know,

1197
00:53:37,110 --> 00:53:40,440
trying to put it together with an 
uncertain future and no one knew,

1198
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:41,870
you know,
what you didn't know,

1199
00:53:42,030 --> 00:53:42,580
you know,
you were,

1200
00:53:42,610 --> 00:53:44,370
you were hoping that it would all work 
out,

1201
00:53:44,371 --> 00:53:49,371
but it was this thing where you're 
trying to figure it out and make it 

1202
00:53:49,371 --> 00:53:49,371
work.

1203
00:53:49,371 --> 00:53:52,730
That's so exciting.
Then it's one of the coolest things 

1204
00:53:52,730 --> 00:53:54,741
about life.
If you can find more of those things 

1205
00:53:54,741 --> 00:53:56,781
that you could fit in your life where 
you're not really sure if it's gonna 

1206
00:53:56,781 --> 00:53:56,781
work out the more of those you could fit
in the better.

1207
00:53:58,090 --> 00:54:01,690
Yeah.
It is like you just gotta you just gotTa

1208
00:54:01,691 --> 00:54:05,440
go for it and follow your instinct.
Simple.

1209
00:54:05,470 --> 00:54:07,180
Simple.
You got it.

1210
00:54:07,300 --> 00:54:12,300
And No,
I did come out here and knowing what 

1211
00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:13,360
would happen,
I had no idea.

1212
00:54:13,361 --> 00:54:14,060
And uh,
you know,

1213
00:54:14,070 --> 00:54:16,510
I had a couple TV,
small little team.

1214
00:54:16,540 --> 00:54:19,240
That was something when I,
when I did the Craig kilborn show,

1215
00:54:19,241 --> 00:54:19,900
that was a.

1216
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:22,330
What do you play on Brian?
A little bit at the show in the.

1217
00:54:22,610 --> 00:54:25,790
Well actually why don't you actually 
play it then do it when he's not talking

1218
00:54:25,791 --> 00:54:26,470
though.
Alright.

1219
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:28,100
You want me to not talk?
No,

1220
00:54:28,430 --> 00:54:30,200
no.
Tell me when did you start in Arizona?

1221
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:33,060
No,
I actually,

1222
00:54:33,061 --> 00:54:38,061
I mean I took an acting class at Arizona
state because I wasn't around baseball 

1223
00:54:38,061 --> 00:54:41,270
so much,
which it is kind of a jock world and you

1224
00:54:41,271 --> 00:54:42,390
know,
that's cool.

1225
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:45,990
But then when I had some extra credits,
I took an acting class.

1226
00:54:46,110 --> 00:54:46,770
Yeah.
People said,

1227
00:54:46,771 --> 00:54:47,730
hey brother,
you're funny.

1228
00:54:47,790 --> 00:54:50,030
I never was,
you know,

1229
00:54:50,070 --> 00:54:53,730
I never went to the Tempe Improv.
I never did an open mic.

1230
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:56,310
Nothing.
I would just played baseball and went to

1231
00:54:56,311 --> 00:55:01,311
school and I remember I'd be up in the 
study hall and a couple of football 

1232
00:55:01,311 --> 00:55:01,800
players and say,
hey brody,

1233
00:55:01,801 --> 00:55:03,120
you're funny.
You should do stand up.

1234
00:55:03,121 --> 00:55:08,121
I would make the other like the 
volleyball team laugh or the track and 

1235
00:55:08,121 --> 00:55:09,440
field we all studied together.
So uh,

1236
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:14,480
the last year,
so I took an acting class so they had 

1237
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:15,750
credits and it was fun,
it was supportive.

1238
00:55:15,751 --> 00:55:20,751
I went in there and it wasn't jocks,
it was supportive artists and girls and 

1239
00:55:21,270 --> 00:55:26,270
it felt good and I try to do something 
serious but I got laughs and I tried to 

1240
00:55:26,551 --> 00:55:31,050
be serious and it was busting up 
laughing but I liked the feeling.

1241
00:55:31,110 --> 00:55:34,770
And then when I came back to Los Angeles
I didn't want to get into baseball,

1242
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:37,410
I just didn't want to be a coach or 
anything like that.

1243
00:55:37,860 --> 00:55:42,860
And I took a,
I took one of those comedy classes just 

1244
00:55:42,860 --> 00:55:45,690
to see if I was into just structure to 
see if I liked it.

1245
00:55:45,691 --> 00:55:50,691
So I was living out in Tarzana and I 
would drive to ucla every Tuesday or 

1246
00:55:50,691 --> 00:55:52,080
Wednesday just to do it two or three 
minute spot.

1247
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:54,540
And I was excited about doing it.
It was like,

1248
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:59,600
okay,
I think it's in me who's teaching the 

1249
00:55:59,600 --> 00:55:59,600
class?
Pauly shore sister.

1250
00:56:00,630 --> 00:56:02,790
But for me it didn't matter.

1251
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:04,240
She never even did stand up.
Right.

1252
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:06,080
I don't know.
She may have.

1253
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:08,680
What's her name again?
Sandy seashore?

1254
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:10,010
No,
sandy shore.

1255
00:56:10,580 --> 00:56:11,350
Seashore,
yeah,

1256
00:56:11,370 --> 00:56:13,610
it is sandy sea shore.
Oh really?

1257
00:56:14,110 --> 00:56:15,470
Goodness.
Mitzi was so crazy.

1258
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:21,720
So she actually,
she helped me and it gave me that 

1259
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:22,430
structure and then I did one open mic.
So it did help you.

1260
00:56:22,820 --> 00:56:23,980
It help me.
When did

1261
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:28,980
you get out of it?
Like I've never heard of anybody doing 

1262
00:56:28,980 --> 00:56:31,320
it.
I get out of it where they got anything 

1263
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:31,320
out of it other than just getting on 
stage.

1264
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:33,910
You got something out of that.
Three things I got out of it were one.

1265
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:37,750
Um,
people thought it was funny,

1266
00:56:38,090 --> 00:56:40,060
you know,
made me feel like it didn't matter about

1267
00:56:40,061 --> 00:56:41,890
my jokes.
They thought it was funny.

1268
00:56:42,370 --> 00:56:46,680
So I got that out of it.
I got um,

1269
00:56:47,410 --> 00:56:52,410
I learned to make it visual.
I did learn some basic stuff about 

1270
00:56:52,410 --> 00:56:53,080
comedy,
making it visual.

1271
00:56:53,890 --> 00:56:56,860
People told me I was funny between my 
jokes.

1272
00:56:56,861 --> 00:57:01,861
My jokes are okay,
but it was funny when I got frustrated 

1273
00:57:01,861 --> 00:57:02,620
with my jokes wouldn't work.
So they liked that.

1274
00:57:03,070 --> 00:57:06,010
They liked the fact that,
like I said,

1275
00:57:06,850 --> 00:57:11,850
it make it visual.
And then I did my graduating class at 

1276
00:57:11,850 --> 00:57:13,660
the comedy store and the,
and the o r it was packed and I did it.

1277
00:57:13,660 --> 00:57:16,390
I did pretty good.
I felt like a comedian.

1278
00:57:16,510 --> 00:57:20,410
And then I did one open mic out in 
Chatsworth and it was a,

1279
00:57:20,460 --> 00:57:22,330
not a disaster,
but it was desperate.

1280
00:57:22,331 --> 00:57:23,380
I felt like,
hey,

1281
00:57:23,381 --> 00:57:28,381
I went from being liked at the dor at 
the comedy store and I'm a comedian now.

1282
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:30,940
And so I went to that open mic and it 
was just,

1283
00:57:31,090 --> 00:57:35,950
I could feel the desperation and I just 
knew that this isn't the route I want to

1284
00:57:35,951 --> 00:57:38,350
go.
And I wanted to learn more about comedy.

1285
00:57:38,351 --> 00:57:40,360
So I took a business,
a comedy class,

1286
00:57:40,361 --> 00:57:43,120
and in that class the instructor told 
me,

1287
00:57:43,330 --> 00:57:45,690
get out of Los Angeles.
That was started here.

1288
00:57:45,710 --> 00:57:46,720
Who was that instructor?
Uh,

1289
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:51,840
Danny Robinson.
She owe me always a APA because an 

1290
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:54,460
agent.
So I just learned about comedy contract.

1291
00:57:54,461 --> 00:57:57,200
What comedians make doing a spot around 
town.

1292
00:57:57,201 --> 00:57:58,350
He told you to get out of La.

1293
00:57:58,360 --> 00:57:59,290
Why?
Yeah.

1294
00:57:59,820 --> 00:58:01,990
Um,
go to a smaller market.

1295
00:58:02,510 --> 00:58:04,500
Go,
go find your voice there.

1296
00:58:04,550 --> 00:58:05,320
You know,
don't,

1297
00:58:05,321 --> 00:58:08,660
don't worry about having a bad set or so
and so.

1298
00:58:08,661 --> 00:58:10,120
It was good to see you.
You know what?

1299
00:58:10,121 --> 00:58:12,680
I would have agreed with that up until 
this year.

1300
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:15,280
This is 1993.
Yeah,

1301
00:58:15,281 --> 00:58:20,281
but I would have agreed with that,
like that advice and I've given that 

1302
00:58:20,281 --> 00:58:23,971
advice before,
but I don't think it's necessary 

1303
00:58:23,971 --> 00:58:25,501
anymore.
I think La has such a strong open mic 

1304
00:58:25,501 --> 00:58:28,201
community too.
There's so many comedians coming up in 

1305
00:58:28,201 --> 00:58:28,201
La and there's so many different places 
to do standup.

1306
00:58:28,201 --> 00:58:33,180
I think it's just as good a place as any
to do to do comedy and I think that 

1307
00:58:33,180 --> 00:58:35,530
guy's really the significance of the 
club itself,

1308
00:58:35,590 --> 00:58:38,980
being on stage of the club and getting 
seen is not nearly as much as it used to

1309
00:58:38,981 --> 00:58:43,981
be with now.
What's more important now is the 

1310
00:58:43,981 --> 00:58:45,910
Internet is the fact that library guys 
get famous from Philly.

1311
00:58:45,940 --> 00:58:48,250
They get famous from New York.
They get famous from everywhere.

1312
00:58:48,251 --> 00:58:53,251
They don't.
You don't have to be in front of a 

1313
00:58:53,251 --> 00:58:53,470
specific group of people who can decide 
whether or not to put you on television.

1314
00:58:53,950 --> 00:58:56,530
You just put your shit up online and 
because of that,

1315
00:58:56,800 --> 00:59:01,800
because of phones recording sets,
so many people's shows are getting 

1316
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:05,080
online to like people are getting to see
the development of material.

1317
00:59:05,081 --> 00:59:07,300
If they want to look for it,
they could find,

1318
00:59:07,301 --> 00:59:09,790
you know,
cell phone videos of all of us,

1319
00:59:09,820 --> 00:59:11,950
you know,
on a regular basis almost.

1320
00:59:12,090 --> 00:59:13,630
You know,
you do a weekend at a club,

1321
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:18,840
you do five shows,
someone's going to put a fucking video 

1322
00:59:18,840 --> 00:59:18,840
online.
I mean,

1323
00:59:18,840 --> 00:59:20,380
I,
I think I'm glad I went to Seattle.

1324
00:59:20,381 --> 00:59:25,381
This is basically pre-internet because 
it taught me about the three person 

1325
00:59:25,381 --> 00:59:26,840
show.
It taught me about the MC,

1326
00:59:26,841 --> 00:59:28,580
the guest host,
the opener,

1327
00:59:28,730 --> 00:59:32,510
the closer clearing out the audience,
how you sat the audience.

1328
00:59:32,511 --> 00:59:34,720
I worked there as well.
Um,

1329
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:39,800
which would work at this.
Was that comedy underground up in 

1330
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:39,800
Seattle?
Greg Club?

1331
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:40,370
Yeah.
So I would see,

1332
00:59:40,371 --> 00:59:43,020
you know,
Patton Oswald Large Park or

1333
00:59:43,590 --> 00:59:48,590
they had the comedy underground and 
there was another one that was run by 

1334
00:59:48,590 --> 00:59:48,590
like a mormon or something like that.

1335
00:59:48,590 --> 00:59:48,840
Uh,
that was uh,

1336
00:59:48,900 --> 00:59:51,510
giggles by Terry Terry Taylor ran that

1337
00:59:51,550 --> 00:59:55,360
room and I would do that room is very 
religious or something.

1338
00:59:55,380 --> 01:00:00,380
Who was the guy who got up in front of 
Robert Schimmel and like apologized for 

1339
01:00:00,380 --> 01:00:01,750
a set.
I don't know,

1340
01:00:01,751 --> 01:00:05,050
I just know that Terry Taylor is,
is or was Mormon.

1341
01:00:05,850 --> 01:00:06,400
Yeah.

1342
01:00:06,750 --> 01:00:09,720
And he ran giggles in,
in Seattle,

1343
01:00:09,721 --> 01:00:10,800
near the university there.

1344
01:00:10,850 --> 01:00:15,850
There's this famous story where a guy 
got up in front of Schimmel and like 

1345
01:00:15,850 --> 01:00:19,211
apologized for a set before he did it 
because your demos really hilarious but 

1346
01:00:19,431 --> 01:00:21,540
really dirty.
And uh,

1347
01:00:21,710 --> 01:00:26,330
he went up before him was schindler,
Bobby Slayton not sure which one,

1348
01:00:26,331 --> 01:00:29,090
but it was just an outrage through the 
comedy community.

1349
01:00:29,091 --> 01:00:32,340
Like you hired this guy,
like why are you apologizing for him?

1350
01:00:32,341 --> 01:00:34,280
The people came to see him,
like,

1351
01:00:34,281 --> 01:00:39,281
why are you apologizing for him?
You knew what he did and you hired them 

1352
01:00:39,410 --> 01:00:43,010
and the podium and he apologized for the
full.

1353
01:00:43,070 --> 01:00:43,780
Brought the guy up

1354
01:00:43,810 --> 01:00:45,460
before.
Yes.

1355
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:50,520
Like I said,
this guy may be dirty and that doesn't 

1356
01:00:50,520 --> 01:00:51,820
fit our value system here.
This is the alleged story.

1357
01:00:51,850 --> 01:00:52,230
Well,
they don't.

1358
01:00:52,350 --> 01:00:54,250
This is what I had heard known by people
who were there.

1359
01:00:54,870 --> 01:00:59,870
Do you mean they don't know?
I mean it was a big store that's spread 

1360
01:00:59,870 --> 01:01:03,780
and I remember I talked about on the 
radio once and the guy said it didn't 

1361
01:01:03,780 --> 01:01:05,110
censor comedians.
He invited me to come down to the club,

1362
01:01:05,350 --> 01:01:07,810
but I never wound up doing it.
I did the underground.

1363
01:01:07,811 --> 01:01:07,920
Okay.

1364
01:01:08,130 --> 01:01:09,040
Yeah.
It's a good club.

1365
01:01:09,041 --> 01:01:10,150
Low ceiling,
all that.

1366
01:01:10,430 --> 01:01:11,260
Joe,
what would you.

1367
01:01:11,290 --> 01:01:15,250
So you would say to a comedian today in 
2013 here,

1368
01:01:15,251 --> 01:01:17,620
say in Los Angeles,
somebody comes up to you and he goes,

1369
01:01:17,621 --> 01:01:19,570
Joe,
I'm a stand up.

1370
01:01:19,571 --> 01:01:22,420
I'm doing open mics here in La,
you know,

1371
01:01:22,510 --> 01:01:22,980
w,
w,

1372
01:01:22,981 --> 01:01:26,390
w what he wants to be a stand up,
you know,

1373
01:01:26,550 --> 01:01:28,130
what will,
what would you say to Shay?

1374
01:01:28,380 --> 01:01:29,620
What would you say to a comedian

1375
01:01:29,790 --> 01:01:32,610
that go hang out at the comedy store?
You really would say that.

1376
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:34,650
Fuck yeah,
that's what fear did.

1377
01:01:35,620 --> 01:01:37,830
See,
I wouldn't say that they're turning into

1378
01:01:37,831 --> 01:01:42,831
a standup,
especially not now because they cut the 

1379
01:01:42,831 --> 01:01:42,831
open mics to one day now.
Well that's retarded.

1380
01:01:42,831 --> 01:01:47,230
That's retarded on their behalf because 
that was one of the greatest things 

1381
01:01:47,230 --> 01:01:49,941
about the comedy store's,
how much emphasis they put into 

1382
01:01:49,941 --> 01:01:52,461
developing talent.
I mean the very few clubs have two 

1383
01:01:52,461 --> 01:01:53,460
nights of open mic nights.
They fucked up if they did that,

1384
01:01:53,850 --> 01:01:55,130
but I'm not surprised.
You know,

1385
01:01:55,170 --> 01:01:57,990
they've been fucking up left and right 
with a lot of different details,

1386
01:01:57,991 --> 01:02:02,991
but even when they had to open mics,
I don't know how many comedian it's off 

1387
01:02:03,541 --> 01:02:08,541
the street.
A guy who drove here from Kansas City 

1388
01:02:08,541 --> 01:02:08,541
and goes,
I want to be a comedian.

1389
01:02:08,541 --> 01:02:09,840
I'm going to hang out the store.
I mean those,

1390
01:02:09,870 --> 01:02:12,270
those.
Those are few and far between.

1391
01:02:12,271 --> 01:02:13,290
I think.
I don't think so.

1392
01:02:13,350 --> 01:02:18,350
You don't think so?
I think guys have made it out of La a 

1393
01:02:18,350 --> 01:02:18,960
lot more over the last 10 years than 
you'd imagine a lot of.

1394
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:20,130
Started out in La.

1395
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:25,160
A lot of guys started their standup 
career doing open mics in La and then 

1396
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:27,060
went on to have like legit careers like 
already does.

1397
01:02:27,420 --> 01:02:31,000
Ours are started at all in La.
He's a legit standing.

1398
01:02:31,010 --> 01:02:32,130
Okay.
That's one guy.

1399
01:02:32,820 --> 01:02:36,030
That's an exception to the rule.
I would think I know about that man.

1400
01:02:36,070 --> 01:02:39,870
I know there's a lot.
CAPRA low started.

1401
01:02:39,900 --> 01:02:41,940
There's another one.
There's a lot of guys who started out in

1402
01:02:41,941 --> 01:02:43,770
La.
There's a lot of goddamn clubs,

1403
01:02:43,771 --> 01:02:48,771
man.
Think about how many fucking clubs or 

1404
01:02:48,771 --> 01:02:50,751
just within an hour and a half,
two hours of here is unprecedented 

1405
01:02:50,751 --> 01:02:51,150
comedy.
Magic Club.

1406
01:02:51,151 --> 01:02:52,290
The improv,
the comedy store,

1407
01:02:52,291 --> 01:02:54,780
the laugh factory.
Ontario club.

1408
01:02:54,781 --> 01:02:56,110
Yeah.
Ontario Bray.

1409
01:02:56,111 --> 01:02:59,700
A vine.
You can go on and on and on and on.

1410
01:03:00,130 --> 01:03:02,840
It's still hard to get into those clubs.
House.

1411
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:07,960
It's hard.
It's hard to get into those clubs 

1412
01:03:07,960 --> 01:03:08,180
almost.
That's why you got to go maybe two.

1413
01:03:08,900 --> 01:03:11,410
I'm not gonna say a boise,
but go to a Seattle,

1414
01:03:11,420 --> 01:03:15,170
go to a Minnesota,
even go to a Chicago in those clubs.

1415
01:03:15,620 --> 01:03:20,620
I think it's easier to get people.
I think it's easier to get on stage in 

1416
01:03:20,620 --> 01:03:25,421
front of a decent situation as a newer 
comedian with a crowd in Chicago or 

1417
01:03:28,670 --> 01:03:32,300
possibly even New York.
Maybe Austin,

1418
01:03:32,780 --> 01:03:35,960
possibly Minnesota.
Seattle.

1419
01:03:35,961 --> 01:03:38,270
Denver's getting a scene.
Denver hasn't seen.

1420
01:03:38,300 --> 01:03:39,840
They've had a scene for years.
You know,

1421
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:44,960
I have a serious scene,
so I think there are spots there where 

1422
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:44,990
you can play those,
you know,

1423
01:03:44,991 --> 01:03:45,700
the,
the,

1424
01:03:45,701 --> 01:03:50,701
the self promoting rooms and you have 
build up and get a buzz going and then 

1425
01:03:51,171 --> 01:03:53,240
come out and play some more rooms.
That was always my thing.

1426
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:55,730
Philosophy.
You definitely can do it that way.

1427
01:03:56,150 --> 01:03:59,240
You definitely can do it.
Obviously many people have done that.

1428
01:03:59,510 --> 01:04:01,730
What I'm saying is you don't.
I don't know if you have to anymore.

1429
01:04:02,090 --> 01:04:03,950
I think La is not a bad place to do it.

1430
01:04:04,660 --> 01:04:08,650
I think there are enough diversity in 
the rooms.

1431
01:04:08,680 --> 01:04:11,440
Like you got your hipster boom.
She got your blue collar room,

1432
01:04:11,441 --> 01:04:14,030
she's got your tour restrooms,
you've got your rooms.

1433
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:18,250
Okay.
Through that and I don't know what.

1434
01:04:18,251 --> 01:04:22,640
Would it be a blue collar room?
Ontario maybe.

1435
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:23,650
I don't know.

1436
01:04:25,450 --> 01:04:30,450
Saddle wrestling to do comedy anymore.
Do they still do it at the universal?

1437
01:04:31,290 --> 01:04:32,790
Oh really?
A universal.

1438
01:04:32,791 --> 01:04:34,010
Not the one on sunset.
No,

1439
01:04:34,040 --> 01:04:34,800
no,
they.

1440
01:04:34,890 --> 01:04:37,650
They do comedy.
The saddle ranch at universal.

1441
01:04:38,360 --> 01:04:39,420
How many on it?
They're a bunch.

1442
01:04:39,421 --> 01:04:41,350
It's fun.
How many different places have comedy?

1443
01:04:41,370 --> 01:04:46,370
Universal?
There's the lovetts club that they're 

1444
01:04:46,370 --> 01:04:46,370
doing.
Standup again there,

1445
01:04:46,370 --> 01:04:46,370
right?
No more pot.

1446
01:04:46,370 --> 01:04:47,940
It was like a podcast and do podcast 
now.

1447
01:04:47,941 --> 01:04:51,900
Also a girl from a d from a Improv now 
runs it.

1448
01:04:51,990 --> 01:04:52,920
Really?
Yeah.

1449
01:04:53,160 --> 01:04:55,530
She runs that place now.
That's interesting.

1450
01:04:55,920 --> 01:05:00,920
That's a weird place to get to.
Shit's annoying to go through the 

1451
01:05:00,920 --> 01:05:01,530
fucking parking and all that nonsense.
They find it.

1452
01:05:01,590 --> 01:05:06,590
They do have that thing now though,
where you can valet your car and then 

1453
01:05:06,590 --> 01:05:07,870
they'll pay for the valet or as good 
than someone's farting in your seats,

1454
01:05:08,100 --> 01:05:11,180
checking your glove box and yeah,
I got to do that.

1455
01:05:11,370 --> 01:05:12,240
Of course they do that.

1456
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:15,770
Do you feel because it's you,
they.

1457
01:05:15,980 --> 01:05:17,620
They go out of their to do it.

1458
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:19,820
I don't know what the fuck do.
What do.

1459
01:05:20,250 --> 01:05:22,300
It?
Depends on the individual obviously,

1460
01:05:22,301 --> 01:05:25,570
but I know when I worked for carwash 
drove people's cars.

1461
01:05:25,990 --> 01:05:27,940
I know they do it.
I know they get inside their car.

1462
01:05:27,941 --> 01:05:29,560
They look around.
I know they do it.

1463
01:05:29,561 --> 01:05:31,050
I did it.
Everybody does it.

1464
01:05:31,220 --> 01:05:32,800
It gets getting in someone's car and 
you're like,

1465
01:05:32,801 --> 01:05:34,990
what's in here?
But are they taking stuff?

1466
01:05:35,410 --> 01:05:36,410
For sure.
No doubt.

1467
01:05:36,460 --> 01:05:38,840
They take some people,
I'm not saying it universal,

1468
01:05:38,841 --> 01:05:43,841
they do,
but a friend of mine just got his 

1469
01:05:43,841 --> 01:05:43,841
sunglasses stolen out of his car for 
sure.

1470
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:46,000
He put them on the front seat,
went to the,

1471
01:05:46,001 --> 01:05:47,950
went to where the fuck he went,
came back and said,

1472
01:05:47,951 --> 01:05:50,440
where's my sunglasses?
And they played stupid and he's like,

1473
01:05:50,500 --> 01:05:52,180
hey man,
I put them right here.

1474
01:05:52,210 --> 01:05:55,330
Like I'm not stupid.
That's stealing is a sin.

1475
01:05:55,331 --> 01:05:56,350
I don't care any.

1476
01:05:56,350 --> 01:06:01,350
I know another person who got the.
They had a little portable navigation 

1477
01:06:01,350 --> 01:06:01,350
system underneath their seat that got 
stolen,

1478
01:06:01,420 --> 01:06:02,800
but it happens all the time.
I know,

1479
01:06:02,801 --> 01:06:07,090
but what's worse than that are fucking 
your sister having sex with your sister.

1480
01:06:07,120 --> 01:06:12,120
That's worth,
I think victim never done this to wants 

1481
01:06:12,120 --> 01:06:12,120
it.
You want it?

1482
01:06:12,120 --> 01:06:16,290
I thought about that.
There's one thing I will go to my grave 

1483
01:06:16,290 --> 01:06:16,290
saying,
I've never had sex with my sister.

1484
01:06:16,290 --> 01:06:17,680
That's a good move.
Yeah,

1485
01:06:17,681 --> 01:06:21,530
there's some things you want to keep off
the resume yet.

1486
01:06:21,830 --> 01:06:26,830
Well,
you don't even want to do it and then 

1487
01:06:26,830 --> 01:06:26,830
go,
well,

1488
01:06:26,830 --> 01:06:28,471
that was a mistake.
Never do that again because you can't 

1489
01:06:28,471 --> 01:06:28,471
really erase it.
No.

1490
01:06:28,471 --> 01:06:32,680
Kind of man because like isn't like 
learning like one of the most important 

1491
01:06:32,680 --> 01:06:36,691
parts of life.
Like shouldn't you be allowed to fuck 

1492
01:06:36,691 --> 01:06:36,691
up?
But you can't.

1493
01:06:36,691 --> 01:06:36,850
There's certain fuck ups you can't make.

1494
01:06:37,090 --> 01:06:40,240
Like you can't be like,
you know a baby.

1495
01:06:40,241 --> 01:06:41,740
I want to marry you.
I want marry you too.

1496
01:06:41,770 --> 01:06:43,710
But I gotta tell you this one thing I 
know,

1497
01:06:43,740 --> 01:06:48,740
I know this is not going to change 
anything because we're meant to be with 

1498
01:06:48,740 --> 01:06:48,740
each other,
but I fucked my cousin.

1499
01:06:49,540 --> 01:06:50,650
Your wife's going to be like,
what?

1500
01:06:51,310 --> 01:06:52,600
Why don't you fuck your cousin?
Wait a minute.

1501
01:06:52,630 --> 01:06:53,660
Which cousin?
Yeah,

1502
01:06:53,990 --> 01:06:54,840
how far.
Wait,

1503
01:06:54,850 --> 01:06:55,180
wait.
What?

1504
01:06:55,240 --> 01:06:58,020
How far I fucked my cousin Mike.
Huh?

1505
01:06:58,240 --> 01:07:02,350
How far was the,
is it a first cousin or is it a uh,

1506
01:07:02,351 --> 01:07:03,580
yeah,
it'd have to be a first cousin.

1507
01:07:04,060 --> 01:07:04,880
Second cousin.
Legal.

1508
01:07:05,050 --> 01:07:07,390
Well it's gay sex.
Um,

1509
01:07:07,480 --> 01:07:09,170
I think no one's going to be happy with 
you.

1510
01:07:10,980 --> 01:07:14,290
Happy that you fucked your cousin.
But it was a joke brody.

1511
01:07:14,410 --> 01:07:16,960
But if it's a raised ranch,
my antlers,

1512
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:21,100
if it's straight,
it's straight sex.

1513
01:07:21,101 --> 01:07:25,660
I think I'm the second cousin is 
actually like legal,

1514
01:07:25,661 --> 01:07:26,800
like you can not only fuck them.

1515
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:27,760
You can marry him,
right?

1516
01:07:27,790 --> 01:07:29,050
Yeah.
Jerry Lee,

1517
01:07:29,051 --> 01:07:30,500
Lewis.
Cousin.

1518
01:07:31,240 --> 01:07:32,430
Can I ask you a question,
Joel?

1519
01:07:32,450 --> 01:07:33,880
It not.
You've got to post to.

1520
01:07:33,940 --> 01:07:38,940
It's been on my mind and I know you 
probably don't want to talk about it 

1521
01:07:38,940 --> 01:07:38,940
because it was brought up.
Well,

1522
01:07:38,940 --> 01:07:39,460
thanks for bringing it up on the 
Internet.

1523
01:07:39,480 --> 01:07:40,720
Well,
it was brought up as well.

1524
01:07:40,721 --> 01:07:44,020
I'm just being real.
Bruce brought up you.

1525
01:07:44,080 --> 01:07:46,570
I think you were uneasy with it.
It was an ice house.

1526
01:07:46,571 --> 01:07:48,400
Chronical.
I'm.

1527
01:07:49,810 --> 01:07:54,810
Why would you bring it up again?
Because I heard Joe talked about gay 

1528
01:07:54,810 --> 01:07:55,330
sex.
Like I have to make it clear.

1529
01:07:55,331 --> 01:07:57,100
I'm not into that.
Oh,

1530
01:07:57,101 --> 01:07:59,980
why do you have to make that clear?
Because I get hassled for it.

1531
01:07:59,981 --> 01:08:04,981
Sometimes it goes back to you again.
Brody notice going back to him and gay 

1532
01:08:04,991 --> 01:08:07,040
sex.
Um,

1533
01:08:07,240 --> 01:08:08,800
apparently you can have sex with your 
cousin.

1534
01:08:09,270 --> 01:08:10,380
It's illegal.
What?

1535
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:12,100
EMC.
If your cousins a transsexual,

1536
01:08:12,340 --> 01:08:16,010
then it's even more legal.
Depends if

1537
01:08:16,110 --> 01:08:17,810
you're telling someone who writes for 
Salon,

1538
01:08:17,811 --> 01:08:22,550
you're in and a few girls that have been
attracted to their cousins,

1539
01:08:22,551 --> 01:08:27,551
but they always use the excuse.
They're not blood related and they've 

1540
01:08:27,551 --> 01:08:27,551
all done.
Yeah,

1541
01:08:27,551 --> 01:08:29,420
that's not real.
I wouldn't have sex with a relative.

1542
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:34,480
Just not into it,
but I think people have done it 

1543
01:08:34,480 --> 01:08:34,480
throughout history.
I think it's Kinda sick.

1544
01:08:34,580 --> 01:08:37,190
Why?
I just don't see them that often.

1545
01:08:37,280 --> 01:08:38,720
I just think it's sick.
I.

1546
01:08:38,721 --> 01:08:43,721
I think incest is a sickening thing and 
I'm sorry it's happened to some young 

1547
01:08:43,721 --> 01:08:44,930
girls or kids or whatever.
Man.

1548
01:08:44,940 --> 01:08:49,940
It would have the name thing.
What if it's a cousin that you really 

1549
01:08:49,940 --> 01:08:50,210
enjoy?
I think a cousin is too close,

1550
01:08:50,270 --> 01:08:55,270
but what of it?
Look what if that cousin is the perfect 

1551
01:08:55,270 --> 01:08:55,910
person for you?
What if you know it does.

1552
01:08:56,060 --> 01:09:01,060
It doesn't make sense,
but you know what the heart wants what 

1553
01:09:01,060 --> 01:09:01,060
it wants.

1554
01:09:01,060 --> 01:09:02,210
Brody and then one good and that's not 
normal.

1555
01:09:02,270 --> 01:09:03,810
How much are you bothered by the fact 
that the,

1556
01:09:03,870 --> 01:09:05,990
the main character on homeland has your 
name?

1557
01:09:06,170 --> 01:09:07,110
I don't.
I'm bothered.

1558
01:09:07,940 --> 01:09:10,610
Should I be crazy?
Because what they call them,

1559
01:09:10,611 --> 01:09:11,690
brody on the show,
I'm like,

1560
01:09:11,960 --> 01:09:14,090
that's not it.
That's all you think of.

1561
01:09:14,110 --> 01:09:16,470
No.
Brody's you maybe the guy who wrote it.

1562
01:09:16,471 --> 01:09:18,870
I saw my name and thought about me.
I don't know.

1563
01:09:18,890 --> 01:09:20,150
It's all about me,
but no,

1564
01:09:20,151 --> 01:09:22,530
it doesn't bother me.
Um,

1565
01:09:23,390 --> 01:09:25,850
so apparently not only can you have sex 
with your cousin,

1566
01:09:25,851 --> 01:09:28,760
but you can have a kid with your cousin 
and dangerous.

1567
01:09:29,670 --> 01:09:31,670
Yeah.
My cousin pretty hot.

1568
01:09:31,730 --> 01:09:34,670
Apparently even having sex with your 
sister is not,

1569
01:09:35,170 --> 01:09:40,170
it's not nearly as dangerous as far as 
producing a kids with health risks.

1570
01:09:41,210 --> 01:09:44,150
There's no real health risk posed by,
um,

1571
01:09:44,540 --> 01:09:48,710
by having sex with your cousins.
I said percentage with sister,

1572
01:09:49,310 --> 01:09:51,230
uh,
it's probably not good,

1573
01:09:51,410 --> 01:09:53,420
but it depends on how much the genes.

1574
01:09:53,420 --> 01:09:53,900
I mean,
look,

1575
01:09:53,910 --> 01:09:58,910
you're,
the idea is that your sister and you 

1576
01:09:58,910 --> 01:10:01,900
come from your mother and your father.
There's already some differences in 

1577
01:10:01,900 --> 01:10:01,900
genetics,
a mixture of those.

1578
01:10:01,900 --> 01:10:03,950
Obviously your mother's side's from 
different,

1579
01:10:04,070 --> 01:10:09,070
but if your parents were cousins and 
then you fucked your sister and had a 

1580
01:10:09,321 --> 01:10:10,320
kid who,
that's,

1581
01:10:10,360 --> 01:10:12,800
that's dipping into the same pool a 
little too much,

1582
01:10:13,070 --> 01:10:16,580
which is probably something that was 
like really common back in the day.

1583
01:10:17,270 --> 01:10:20,150
Like especially with um,
with uh,

1584
01:10:20,240 --> 01:10:21,350
pre-internet.
Yeah.

1585
01:10:21,410 --> 01:10:26,410
No,
with royalty royal people like royal 

1586
01:10:26,410 --> 01:10:28,931
blood,
like one that's like one of the inside 

1587
01:10:28,931 --> 01:10:28,931
jokes.
He's fucking closed.

1588
01:10:28,931 --> 01:10:30,110
Ised their eyes be the,
that close to each other.

1589
01:10:30,120 --> 01:10:32,090
Look all fucking weird.
It's because they're like,

1590
01:10:32,120 --> 01:10:35,960
they're fucking in the same genetic pool
all the time to have royal blood.

1591
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:38,950
Royal blood.
That'd be making sense.

1592
01:10:38,990 --> 01:10:43,990
Why so many of them were fucking insane 
and they think about how many crazy 

1593
01:10:43,990 --> 01:10:44,930
things that kings and queens did.

1594
01:10:45,050 --> 01:10:47,920
Not just the power itself,
but the fact that they were in bread.

1595
01:10:48,380 --> 01:10:49,430
Oh,
we have something to do with it.

1596
01:10:49,690 --> 01:10:54,690
Amish.
I Bet I bet are inbred and a lot of 

1597
01:10:54,690 --> 01:10:54,690
people in West Virginia,
I shouldn't say that.

1598
01:10:54,690 --> 01:10:58,220
They're gonna come get you.
He being shitting on the Amish.

1599
01:10:58,221 --> 01:10:59,210
They are red.
Bam.

1600
01:10:59,930 --> 01:11:02,480
You don't know nothing.
You don't know how to fire up a barn.

1601
01:11:03,620 --> 01:11:05,660
You don't have to make your own bar and 
you're not even a man.

1602
01:11:05,960 --> 01:11:10,960
I love the fact that the amish get a 
chance to go fucking crazy after they 

1603
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:11,640
become an adult.
It's called like bubbles.

1604
01:11:11,650 --> 01:11:12,770
Still skin or something.
They do.

1605
01:11:12,771 --> 01:11:14,160
What do you mean they get to go crazy,

1606
01:11:15,090 --> 01:11:16,710
bro?
Rump Springer.

1607
01:11:16,770 --> 01:11:18,360
Yeah.
They get a.

1608
01:11:18,590 --> 01:11:20,040
They go on.
Use Electricity.

1609
01:11:20,550 --> 01:11:23,550
The fuck they get to do drugs,
aren't they messed up?

1610
01:11:23,551 --> 01:11:24,570
I see.
Those amish shows.

1611
01:11:24,571 --> 01:11:26,460
They seem like they have.
They do have problems.

1612
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:28,080
I think you're really generalizing,
sir.

1613
01:11:28,081 --> 01:11:29,530
I don't know.
The Amish.

1614
01:11:30,090 --> 01:11:33,570
The amish friends would like that.
That you're generalizing,

1615
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:35,910
aren't they fucked up?
I sit on the show.

1616
01:11:35,911 --> 01:11:39,420
I didn't say the f word and I said no,
he didn't say fucked up.

1617
01:11:39,660 --> 01:11:41,210
Did I?
Brian believe you did.

1618
01:11:41,250 --> 01:11:43,170
They seem massive.
Fucked up.

1619
01:11:43,510 --> 01:11:45,360
Wind the tape.
I don't think I said the f word.

1620
01:11:45,970 --> 01:11:48,660
I don't think you said messed up.
That wouldn't sound right.

1621
01:11:48,900 --> 01:11:52,770
You're a grown man.
It doesn't matter.

1622
01:11:53,190 --> 01:11:58,190
I think more and more important.
I think more and more people are not 

1623
01:11:58,190 --> 01:12:00,600
going back after the is still.
Skins are done.

1624
01:12:00,660 --> 01:12:01,860
Yeah.
Yeah.

1625
01:12:01,910 --> 01:12:03,710
Rumspringa also spelled

1626
01:12:03,730 --> 01:12:07,690
from spring.
I N G E or Rumspringa.

1627
01:12:08,470 --> 01:12:09,010
Hmm.
Okay.

1628
01:12:09,011 --> 01:12:12,410
That's the same thing.
Rump o s h spring,

1629
01:12:12,420 --> 01:12:17,420
uh,
is a period of adolescence where some 

1630
01:12:17,420 --> 01:12:20,581
members of the amish community during 
which a youth temporary leaves the 

1631
01:12:21,941 --> 01:12:24,580
community to experience life in the 
outside world.

1632
01:12:25,060 --> 01:12:26,500
Just sucking car.

1633
01:12:26,740 --> 01:12:28,480
Are they allowed to do that?

1634
01:12:28,590 --> 01:12:29,430
Yeah.
They're going off,

1635
01:12:29,431 --> 01:12:30,420
man.
They're allowed to.

1636
01:12:30,421 --> 01:12:32,320
And then they decide whether they come 
back or they,

1637
01:12:32,321 --> 01:12:33,270
they,
they don't come.

1638
01:12:33,480 --> 01:12:36,130
We should.
They're allowed to go out and have sex.

1639
01:12:36,131 --> 01:12:37,390
These girls is fascinating.

1640
01:12:37,650 --> 01:12:39,420
Something that I didn't know.
The Amish.

1641
01:12:39,660 --> 01:12:43,260
The Amish is a subset of the anabaptist 
Christian movement,

1642
01:12:43,470 --> 01:12:47,510
which I think was originally started by 
Martin Luther and a $1,500,

1643
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:52,520
a fucking amazing podcast by Dan Carlin 
hardcore history podcast on Martin 

1644
01:12:55,260 --> 01:13:00,260
Luther and the,
the anabaptists and all these people 

1645
01:13:00,260 --> 01:13:02,781
that it was back in the time where they 
first learned how to interpret the Bible

1646
01:13:03,810 --> 01:13:08,810
and put it in a form that was phonetic,
were a regular person could read it 

1647
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:10,980
because apparently before the 15 
hundreds,

1648
01:13:11,190 --> 01:13:14,340
you really couldn't read the Bible.
You had to learn about it from a priest.

1649
01:13:14,341 --> 01:13:17,970
And if you were one of those rare people
that spoke Latin and read Latin,

1650
01:13:18,180 --> 01:13:19,500
then you could read it.
But I mean,

1651
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:23,570
it wasn't like available to the public.
These were like sacred texts.

1652
01:13:23,571 --> 01:13:27,000
Like the idea that you get to a Bible in
every hotel room,

1653
01:13:27,330 --> 01:13:27,960
you know,
when you're,

1654
01:13:27,990 --> 01:13:30,180
when you're on the road,
how much every hotel room,

1655
01:13:30,181 --> 01:13:30,720
the gideons.

1656
01:13:30,720 --> 01:13:35,720
I mean,
they had the old Bill Hicks book about 

1657
01:13:35,720 --> 01:13:36,060
remember to anybody ever seen to Gideon,
I'm going to capture Gideon.

1658
01:13:36,300 --> 01:13:37,460
He did a bit about,
uh,

1659
01:13:37,610 --> 01:13:42,610
uh,
like setting a trap and calling the 

1660
01:13:42,610 --> 01:13:42,750
hotel room doesn't seem to have a Bible 
in it.

1661
01:13:42,810 --> 01:13:46,080
You think you could send someone up that
he was going to capture Gideon,

1662
01:13:46,350 --> 01:13:51,350
but back then before Martin Luther 
translated the Bible into a phonetic 

1663
01:13:51,451 --> 01:13:56,451
form,
people had no idea what the fuck was in 

1664
01:13:56,451 --> 01:13:56,451
that book.
They just had to listen to these asshole

1665
01:13:56,451 --> 01:13:57,570
priest tell them.
And then once he did that,

1666
01:13:57,571 --> 01:13:59,220
like they wanted people wanted to kill 
him.

1667
01:13:59,620 --> 01:14:04,620
They're like,
it was like a huge change of philosophy 

1668
01:14:04,620 --> 01:14:09,470
for,
for the whole Christian culture because 

1669
01:14:09,470 --> 01:14:11,691
people started reading into the Bible 
themselves and then there's all these 

1670
01:14:11,691 --> 01:14:13,810
interpretations of it and Shit.
But I didn't know that the sub sect that

1671
01:14:13,811 --> 01:14:17,080
amish being was a subsect of that 
window.

1672
01:14:17,081 --> 01:14:20,170
What the fuck happened?
They decided not to have electricity.

1673
01:14:21,320 --> 01:14:22,510
Like w.
what's that about?

1674
01:14:23,420 --> 01:14:25,720
I,
it probably teaches,

1675
01:14:26,620 --> 01:14:31,620
I don't know want to say family values,
but you really have to rely on each 

1676
01:14:31,620 --> 01:14:31,660
other and go out there and

1677
01:14:32,250 --> 01:14:34,630
hunt for food.
And do they hunt though?

1678
01:14:34,631 --> 01:14:37,740
I think cut it up raw.
I don't know how they eat.

1679
01:14:38,220 --> 01:14:38,640
Well,
I mean,

1680
01:14:38,641 --> 01:14:43,641
I'm sure some of them may hunt,
but I think there are other whole thing 

1681
01:14:43,641 --> 01:14:43,641
is farming,
right?

1682
01:14:43,641 --> 01:14:45,510
Yeah.
They're farming vegetables.

1683
01:14:45,660 --> 01:14:46,440
Kale,

1684
01:14:47,490 --> 01:14:48,460
maybe a

1685
01:14:49,740 --> 01:14:51,380
no apples.
Are they allowed to go to.

1686
01:14:51,490 --> 01:14:52,820
They ride bicycles,
right?

1687
01:14:53,530 --> 01:14:55,770
Did you ever see that Amish Mafia show?
Yeah,

1688
01:14:56,530 --> 01:14:58,060
that was a fascinating one,
but the,

1689
01:14:58,510 --> 01:14:59,410
the,
the show,

1690
01:14:59,411 --> 01:15:01,630
the movie on Spring.
It was the best.

1691
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:06,070
That was one that got pretty real.
What the fuck is that movie?

1692
01:15:06,170 --> 01:15:10,300
I said that reality show with like the 
amish kids kingpin to La,

1693
01:15:10,650 --> 01:15:13,780
but there was a movie.
What was the fucking campaign was good?

1694
01:15:13,781 --> 01:15:15,160
Yeah.
There was amish.

1695
01:15:15,280 --> 01:15:15,820
No.
Yeah,

1696
01:15:15,821 --> 01:15:17,740
kingpin was hilarious.
Devil's playground.

1697
01:15:17,741 --> 01:15:19,660
That's the one.
It's a documentary.

1698
01:15:20,170 --> 01:15:23,590
You want the 2000,
ten one or no shit?

1699
01:15:24,850 --> 01:15:25,450
No,
you don't.

1700
01:15:26,300 --> 01:15:29,770
I'm just a lot of like different 
versions of it.

1701
01:15:29,800 --> 01:15:31,930
Holy Shit.
Devil's playground.

1702
01:15:31,931 --> 01:15:36,931
They've done like.
Why do people keep calling it devil's 

1703
01:15:36,931 --> 01:15:36,931
playground?
You fucks.

1704
01:15:36,931 --> 01:15:38,320
You guys are ruining everything.
There's so many devils.

1705
01:15:38,321 --> 01:15:40,810
Playgrounds.
This is ridiculous.

1706
01:15:41,200 --> 01:15:42,910
How can you keep calling it devil's 
playground?

1707
01:15:43,210 --> 01:15:44,530
Look at this devil's playground.
Nineteen,

1708
01:15:44,531 --> 01:15:47,320
28 and a Australian silent film.

1709
01:15:47,830 --> 01:15:51,700
Nineteen 37.
And American drama in 1946.

1710
01:15:51,701 --> 01:15:54,130
I drama.
Nineteen 76.

1711
01:15:54,160 --> 01:15:57,190
Hamadie and Australian semi 
autobiography.

1712
01:15:57,520 --> 01:16:00,370
Two thousand two.
A documentary about the amish.

1713
01:16:00,430 --> 01:16:02,890
That's the one that's the one you want 
devil's playground.

1714
01:16:02,891 --> 01:16:07,891
Two thousand two.
A documentary by Lucy Walker about the 

1715
01:16:07,891 --> 01:16:09,220
amish period called Rumspringa.
It's really interesting.

1716
01:16:09,250 --> 01:16:14,250
It's really interesting.
And what I thought was really 

1717
01:16:14,250 --> 01:16:17,341
fascinating about it is you see the,
like the confusion in the kids,

1718
01:16:17,580 --> 01:16:20,110
you know,
whether they get this weird break,

1719
01:16:20,500 --> 01:16:25,500
they get this weird break and they just 
want to fucking drink and they smoke 

1720
01:16:25,500 --> 01:16:26,590
cigarettes and get crazy and use 
electricity.

1721
01:16:26,890 --> 01:16:31,890
I'm going to go check my local breadbox 
she said a joke for this.

1722
01:16:33,280 --> 01:16:34,610
Is that you're saying for this?
Yeah.

1723
01:16:34,620 --> 01:16:37,840
I thought about.
I thought about for 20 seconds.

1724
01:16:38,110 --> 01:16:41,950
Should I say when I should say if you 
thinking about it,

1725
01:16:41,951 --> 01:16:43,630
you lose the magic.
Brody Stevens.

1726
01:16:43,660 --> 01:16:45,820
I don't have to tell you that.
Steven Brody Stevens,

1727
01:16:45,940 --> 01:16:48,640
you know the rules.
Think about it too much.

1728
01:16:49,430 --> 01:16:52,380
Was the manager.
Who are you?

1729
01:16:52,390 --> 01:16:53,770
David Copperfield?
No,

1730
01:16:53,950 --> 01:16:56,140
no.
I'm Lance Bass.

1731
01:17:01,060 --> 01:17:02,710
Yeah.
I don't think they're really amish.

1732
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:05,080
I don't think you're allowed to fuck in 
front of a camera if you're amish.

1733
01:17:05,081 --> 01:17:08,560
I think it steals your soul for.
Is that Indians that were Asian?

1734
01:17:08,561 --> 01:17:09,470
I thought,
no,

1735
01:17:09,471 --> 01:17:09,830
no,
no,

1736
01:17:09,831 --> 01:17:10,400
no.
The Asian.

1737
01:17:10,401 --> 01:17:12,180
You're not allowed to see the vagina.
You know.

1738
01:17:12,250 --> 01:17:15,680
See pubic hair or the genitals.
They blur all that out.

1739
01:17:16,150 --> 01:17:18,360
Why would you?
Why would you want to see hair?

1740
01:17:18,460 --> 01:17:20,770
It doesn't look weird or it does look 
weird.

1741
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:23,050
Are you being racist?
You're talking about positive energy.

1742
01:17:23,051 --> 01:17:27,310
I go to Panda Express.
I know from what I got.

1743
01:17:27,440 --> 01:17:30,070
He's had some pixelation in his mouth 
from a man.

1744
01:17:30,700 --> 01:17:32,080
I have not.
And that's,

1745
01:17:32,340 --> 01:17:34,570
that's me.
Take that back crying.

1746
01:17:34,571 --> 01:17:36,460
Please don't take that back.
That's going to get out.

1747
01:17:36,461 --> 01:17:41,290
That I had.
That has never ever happened and I never

1748
01:17:41,291 --> 01:17:43,360
ever want to do that.
So out there.

1749
01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:45,820
Thank you.
You just put it out there.

1750
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:47,380
What is this?
Ten percent you keep saying,

1751
01:17:47,381 --> 01:17:49,750
why do you keep saying 10 percent?
Well,

1752
01:17:50,160 --> 01:17:53,560
by Brian keeps saying 10 percent.
It's a running joke based.

1753
01:17:53,561 --> 01:17:55,330
In truth.
I had some issues.

1754
01:17:55,331 --> 01:18:00,331
I had some situations in my life and I 
like to put numbers on things and based 

1755
01:18:00,851 --> 01:18:04,960
on these factors and experiences and 
thought processes,

1756
01:18:05,260 --> 01:18:10,260
we came to the number of a 10 percent 
gay.

1757
01:18:10,721 --> 01:18:12,250
I'm open with it,
you know,

1758
01:18:12,440 --> 01:18:12,750
it,
it,

1759
01:18:13,140 --> 01:18:14,560
it's not.
What did you just say?

1760
01:18:15,320 --> 01:18:17,500
It's not.
I understand what you just said.

1761
01:18:17,830 --> 01:18:20,890
What you just said was a statement that 
would really work if everybody knew what

1762
01:18:20,891 --> 01:18:22,750
you were saying,
but I don't know what we're saying.

1763
01:18:22,770 --> 01:18:24,670
So we,
you're saying is a 10 percent gay?

1764
01:18:24,671 --> 01:18:26,020
I'm open with it.
What does that mean?

1765
01:18:26,230 --> 01:18:27,430
Does that mean you're 10 percent?

1766
01:18:28,070 --> 01:18:33,070
Yes.
I came out on my podcast probably like 

1767
01:18:33,070 --> 01:18:34,640
six months ago.
You came out 10 percent?

1768
01:18:34,760 --> 01:18:36,800
Yes.
What's so funny?

1769
01:18:42,930 --> 01:18:44,110
Is there any beers in there?
Jamie?

1770
01:18:44,410 --> 01:18:47,420
Go get me a beer.
I need a beer on this one.

1771
01:18:47,430 --> 01:18:48,640
That this is going to get.
No,

1772
01:18:48,910 --> 01:18:51,290
we don't have to talk in that and that 
ashtray over this way.

1773
01:18:52,370 --> 01:18:54,650
An Ashtray.
Joe Needs a beer and an ashtray.

1774
01:18:55,860 --> 01:19:00,860
Cigar.
And it's also based on when you were in 

1775
01:19:01,041 --> 01:19:04,570
the Philippines or Taiwan,
isn't it that you.

1776
01:19:05,310 --> 01:19:10,310
That that factored into.
Did you know a joe?

1777
01:19:11,541 --> 01:19:12,570
Did you know any of this part?

1778
01:19:12,680 --> 01:19:15,220
At this story?
I heard rumors online,

1779
01:19:15,221 --> 01:19:20,221
but since I love brody like a brother,
since we were brothers in the art of 

1780
01:19:20,221 --> 01:19:23,521
standup comic comedy,
since we are old school comedy store 

1781
01:19:23,521 --> 01:19:24,730
brethren were old school bro.

1782
01:19:24,900 --> 01:19:26,180
You and I,
we go back,

1783
01:19:26,290 --> 01:19:31,290
we go back man.
How many fun times that we had in that 

1784
01:19:31,290 --> 01:19:31,290
place?
Tons.

1785
01:19:31,290 --> 01:19:32,280
I mean,
a lot.

1786
01:19:32,281 --> 01:19:34,610
Those are early two thousands.
You have

1787
01:19:34,710 --> 01:19:36,520
one set one night.
It wasn't the comedy store,

1788
01:19:36,540 --> 01:19:41,540
but at the Improv that I always tell 
people about a turner room around 

1789
01:19:41,540 --> 01:19:45,921
moment.
There was a moment where you were 

1790
01:19:45,921 --> 01:19:47,850
onstage where um,
you were headed to the stage.

1791
01:19:47,880 --> 01:19:50,580
It was at the Improv.
It was a late night set.

1792
01:19:50,581 --> 01:19:54,390
It was really late night and the crowd 
was just about fucking done.

1793
01:19:54,600 --> 01:19:56,580
They had seen a couple of scrubs before 
you,

1794
01:19:56,970 --> 01:20:00,030
a couple people with on before you that 
just didn't fucking,

1795
01:20:00,060 --> 01:20:01,830
just couldn't pull it off,
you know,

1796
01:20:01,831 --> 01:20:02,320
it was,
uh,

1797
01:20:02,820 --> 01:20:07,820
you know,
there's a totally different energy in 

1798
01:20:07,820 --> 01:20:10,251
those late night audiences,
but all those sets that you had done at 

1799
01:20:10,251 --> 01:20:11,590
the comedy store where you beat on the 
drums when the on the chairs,

1800
01:20:11,770 --> 01:20:15,900
brody would bring chairs on stage and 
drumsticks and pound on the,

1801
01:20:15,901 --> 01:20:16,960
on the chairs and,
and,

1802
01:20:16,980 --> 01:20:19,370
and just change the energy of the 
audience,

1803
01:20:19,390 --> 01:20:24,390
make it like this,
this thing where you could feel the 

1804
01:20:24,390 --> 01:20:26,361
energy again.
You took your shirt off and he starts 

1805
01:20:26,361 --> 01:20:29,111
swinging it over your head and you were,
you were like cheerleading in the crowd 

1806
01:20:29,111 --> 01:20:30,180
and you go,
come on,

1807
01:20:30,590 --> 01:20:35,590
it's me,
it Steven Brody Stevens is the less you 

1808
01:20:35,590 --> 01:20:35,590
do it.
Yeah,

1809
01:20:35,590 --> 01:20:36,020
let's do it.
You,

1810
01:20:36,070 --> 01:20:39,090
you had music playing.
It was fucking fun.

1811
01:20:39,160 --> 01:20:41,430
I remember that night and I,
I had uh,

1812
01:20:41,550 --> 01:20:46,550
played drumsticks on the uh,
the metal railings and yeah,

1813
01:20:46,861 --> 01:20:48,720
you're not just trying to have fun.
And I did.

1814
01:20:48,750 --> 01:20:52,320
The improv is a good place for me to 
open up and you know,

1815
01:20:52,390 --> 01:20:55,920
you read a room sometimes and you gotta 
you gotta like you gotTa pick it up.

1816
01:20:55,921 --> 01:20:58,920
Sometimes you're going to sacrifice your
jokes,

1817
01:20:58,921 --> 01:21:03,921
but then it's like,
it depends like when you're hosting or 

1818
01:21:03,921 --> 01:21:03,921
whatever.
But that was a fun,

1819
01:21:03,921 --> 01:21:04,950
sad,
you know,

1820
01:21:05,080 --> 01:21:07,870
it's having fun,
having fun matters.

1821
01:21:07,960 --> 01:21:12,960
It does.
And that's why you should tell us about 

1822
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:13,480
what happened in Thailand.
What wasn't fun?

1823
01:21:13,540 --> 01:21:15,880
It was.
You enjoyed it.

1824
01:21:16,330 --> 01:21:17,380
No.
To completion.

1825
01:21:17,410 --> 01:21:20,020
Everybody.
People hung out.

1826
01:21:20,530 --> 01:21:21,860
You know,
it's,

1827
01:21:24,030 --> 01:21:27,340
cops come fucking buildings on fire.
Bodies were everywhere.

1828
01:21:27,370 --> 01:21:29,200
What happened?
People hung out.

1829
01:21:29,550 --> 01:21:30,450
Look,
without giving,

1830
01:21:31,210 --> 01:21:33,010
without,
without giving too much away.

1831
01:21:33,011 --> 01:21:35,870
We do explain it in my show.
Um,

1832
01:21:36,790 --> 01:21:39,040
when you go to Bangkok,
leave us hanging,

1833
01:21:39,041 --> 01:21:39,820
you know,
I'll tell you,

1834
01:21:39,821 --> 01:21:41,950
but I don't want to give it away because
if people see you on the show,

1835
01:21:41,951 --> 01:21:44,800
you've got a big audience,
they'll see it on the show is again,

1836
01:21:44,980 --> 01:21:46,320
well,
I don't want to give away.

1837
01:21:46,750 --> 01:21:48,370
Trust me.
This is a puzzling case.

1838
01:21:48,810 --> 01:21:50,590
People are going to want to examine this
from every angle.

1839
01:21:50,620 --> 01:21:52,450
They're to want to find out.
I guarantee you the,

1840
01:21:52,470 --> 01:21:54,670
the amount of people that download that 
ice house chronicles,

1841
01:21:54,671 --> 01:21:56,200
we brought this up.
They're going to go through the roof.

1842
01:21:56,201 --> 01:21:56,810
What number?
Brian?

1843
01:21:58,050 --> 01:22:00,880
Forty eight to figure it out.
Google it.

1844
01:22:01,030 --> 01:22:01,630
Okay,
awesome.

1845
01:22:01,680 --> 01:22:04,900
Saying as I went to Bangkok,
we had fun.

1846
01:22:05,380 --> 01:22:08,720
You go to an area where they all these 
different bars and they have the other,

1847
01:22:09,640 --> 01:22:13,180
they have the get togethers,
the ping pong balls,

1848
01:22:13,181 --> 01:22:13,780
the,
uh,

1849
01:22:14,360 --> 01:22:19,360
the,
the young Vietnamese girls who will sit 

1850
01:22:19,360 --> 01:22:20,590
next to you for a coca cola,
that kind of thing.

1851
01:22:20,591 --> 01:22:23,230
May you watch them dance.
I'll dance for you.

1852
01:22:23,231 --> 01:22:25,480
They'll sit by your side.
They smell good.

1853
01:22:26,350 --> 01:22:29,830
Sometimes they're top.
If you really want to be with them,

1854
01:22:30,040 --> 01:22:34,300
you can spend the money and it's 
actually not that much.

1855
01:22:34,390 --> 01:22:35,830
Okay.
I want to say that.

1856
01:22:36,040 --> 01:22:41,040
So they have a few areas like that.
A lot of the westerners hang out and go 

1857
01:22:41,040 --> 01:22:41,040
there.
It's fun,

1858
01:22:41,040 --> 01:22:43,480
it's different and it's simple.
It's simple.

1859
01:22:45,910 --> 01:22:47,300
And then you go upstairs

1860
01:22:48,370 --> 01:22:50,530
and it's a little different.
You're getting a little like,

1861
01:22:50,560 --> 01:22:55,560
Whoa,
that looks a little different in there 

1862
01:22:55,560 --> 01:22:57,481
that the bone structure's interesting,
but I see some other people dancing and 

1863
01:22:58,061 --> 01:23:00,970
then there's this one club that you go 
in and it's like,

1864
01:23:00,971 --> 01:23:04,300
I guess the best one up there and it's 
just they're having a party.

1865
01:23:04,301 --> 01:23:08,830
It's fun.
The girls look like girls,

1866
01:23:08,890 --> 01:23:12,090
but you can tell like maybe some are 
guys I gas,

1867
01:23:12,091 --> 01:23:17,091
but it was one of these ladyboy bars and
we're hanging out there having fun and 

1868
01:23:17,091 --> 01:23:17,620
they'll,
you know,

1869
01:23:17,621 --> 01:23:18,660
they,
they,

1870
01:23:18,661 --> 01:23:21,100
they will touch you.
They're very forward.

1871
01:23:21,101 --> 01:23:24,310
They will touch your leg,
but they look like girls.

1872
01:23:24,311 --> 01:23:27,610
They smell like girls.
They look like girls.

1873
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:32,760
Dave had the treatments and you're 
sitting there and you're alone by 

1874
01:23:33,161 --> 01:23:34,300
yourself.
You're in,

1875
01:23:34,301 --> 01:23:37,540
you're in Bangkok,
you're working on hangover too.

1876
01:23:38,290 --> 01:23:42,870
They touch and it,
I,

1877
01:23:42,900 --> 01:23:45,100
it's normal to get aroused.

1878
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:51,000
And it was interesting and I knew I was 
16 hours away time zone from America and

1879
01:23:53,501 --> 01:23:56,470
I know Comedians have gone down to 
Brazil or Thailand.

1880
01:23:56,471 --> 01:24:01,210
There's a whole history of it.
So I didn't really pursue it there,

1881
01:24:01,211 --> 01:24:04,180
but I thought about it and then maybe I 
came back on another night.

1882
01:24:04,181 --> 01:24:04,750
I go,
you know,

1883
01:24:04,751 --> 01:24:07,180
people thought I was gay.
The you said maybe.

1884
01:24:07,270 --> 01:24:08,080
No,
you came back,

1885
01:24:08,081 --> 01:24:13,081
right?
Well it was there for like two weeks in 

1886
01:24:13,081 --> 01:24:13,360
Thailand saying maybe I came back.
Well I'm have.

1887
01:24:13,400 --> 01:24:14,980
You're making the story confusing.
Okay,

1888
01:24:14,981 --> 01:24:15,690
well I want one.

1889
01:24:17,150 --> 01:24:19,250
Alright.
I came back another night.

1890
01:24:19,310 --> 01:24:22,570
I said maybe I will come back.
She said,

1891
01:24:23,340 --> 01:24:25,760
the reason why I stopped you want this 
to be.

1892
01:24:25,850 --> 01:24:29,690
I mean at that point I'll probably three
percent gay and that's based off

1893
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:33,470
getting picked on.
As a kid.

1894
01:24:33,471 --> 01:24:35,300
Like brody,
you walk like a girl,

1895
01:24:35,310 --> 01:24:39,530
you understand joe growing up in Tarzana
I got picked on a lot.

1896
01:24:39,590 --> 01:24:44,590
You saying that someone can make you 
homosexual by if they picked on you 

1897
01:24:44,590 --> 01:24:45,300
enough.
Three percent would be 100.

1898
01:24:46,490 --> 01:24:48,270
No,
three percent wouldn't make it a 100.

1899
01:24:48,271 --> 01:24:53,271
But if somebody as a child,
you're in third grade and there's a 

1900
01:24:53,271 --> 01:24:53,400
group of girls or even guys,
you go,

1901
01:24:53,520 --> 01:24:54,420
oh look at brody.
Oh,

1902
01:24:54,421 --> 01:24:56,430
he walks,
he looks like he's gay.

1903
01:24:56,431 --> 01:24:59,820
You walk like a gay gay kid,
you're always smiling and it was like it

1904
01:24:59,821 --> 01:25:04,821
was a nice kid and then I guess because 
of a tilted pelvis I walked weird and I 

1905
01:25:05,791 --> 01:25:07,950
got picked on for that,
so I always felt like,

1906
01:25:08,040 --> 01:25:09,530
wow,
I guess I think I.

1907
01:25:09,640 --> 01:25:11,280
I'm gay.
Maybe.

1908
01:25:11,281 --> 01:25:13,500
I'm guess I'm gay.
I don't know.

1909
01:25:13,580 --> 01:25:14,480
Wow.
Wait a minute.

1910
01:25:14,481 --> 01:25:16,610
So there is this.
The secret.

1911
01:25:16,640 --> 01:25:19,920
Is this the power of suggestion?
Is that one of those things I.

1912
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:25,000
it's a power of being bullied,
so being bullied can turn you 

1913
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:25,000
homosexual.

1914
01:25:25,570 --> 01:25:26,740
It didn't.
It didn't.

1915
01:25:26,750 --> 01:25:28,240
Percent three percent.

1916
01:25:29,170 --> 01:25:32,000
If they're saying it,
if enough people are saying,

1917
01:25:32,300 --> 01:25:33,320
brody,
you.

1918
01:25:33,530 --> 01:25:37,250
If I saw myself walk,
if I sat and I saw myself walk,

1919
01:25:37,251 --> 01:25:41,060
I would think skywalks a little gay.
Well,

1920
01:25:41,061 --> 01:25:46,061
if you,
if you think that,

1921
01:25:46,460 --> 01:25:49,580
why wouldn't you change your walk?
I tried.

1922
01:25:50,110 --> 01:25:55,110
I tried to get a lift in my shoe.
Which side is tilted?

1923
01:25:55,550 --> 01:25:56,750
Which ones don't?
Which ones?

1924
01:25:56,751 --> 01:25:59,630
I think my right shoulder.
You think I'll show it to you.

1925
01:25:59,660 --> 01:26:04,660
Do you know for sure?
Is this just only go to a voodoo doctor 

1926
01:26:04,660 --> 01:26:05,390
udo?
It's like to be a chiropractor.

1927
01:26:05,540 --> 01:26:07,760
The chiropractor,
this is like a physical thing,

1928
01:26:07,790 --> 01:26:09,770
chiropractors,
doctors,

1929
01:26:10,400 --> 01:26:12,920
there's a lot of chiropractors that just
fucking move your neck around,

1930
01:26:12,950 --> 01:26:15,560
take your money.
Not a lot going on.

1931
01:26:15,590 --> 01:26:18,350
I've been to a good chiropractors and 
I've been in chiropractice.

1932
01:26:18,360 --> 01:26:19,130
When you're like,
what?

1933
01:26:19,320 --> 01:26:24,320
What just happened?
That just keeps that guy $60 to rub my 

1934
01:26:24,320 --> 01:26:24,680
neck for 15 seconds because that's what 
it feels like.

1935
01:26:24,680 --> 01:26:26,520
Oh,
I'm going to adjust your healing or your

1936
01:26:26,540 --> 01:26:28,300
anterior posture,
your c seven,

1937
01:26:28,610 --> 01:26:32,420
the late throw some terms at you that 
are like completely unnecessary and very

1938
01:26:32,421 --> 01:26:37,421
verbose and long and then the crack your
neck real quick and it kind of feels 

1939
01:26:37,421 --> 01:26:38,000
good.
I love when they correct the neck.

1940
01:26:38,050 --> 01:26:43,050
Yeah,
it kind of feels good when they crack 

1941
01:26:43,050 --> 01:26:43,050
your neck.
But uh,

1942
01:26:43,050 --> 01:26:45,670
I'm not sure if it works.
Not relieves like it's like a relief as 

1943
01:26:45,670 --> 01:26:46,670
it.
I do that,

1944
01:26:46,700 --> 01:26:48,980
but sometimes it does.
Some guys are good at it,

1945
01:26:48,981 --> 01:26:51,860
but sometimes like what has happened 
there?

1946
01:26:51,920 --> 01:26:54,980
I'd like to get a chiropractic and 
massage.

1947
01:26:54,981 --> 01:26:57,260
That would be good for me to take care 
of myself.

1948
01:26:57,830 --> 01:27:00,530
I don't care if it's a guy miss ms dot.
I don't take them.

1949
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:03,230
I don't care if it's a guy chiropractor.
Okay,

1950
01:27:04,070 --> 01:27:09,070
I'll take a female misuse you don't like
as I would take it like a sports 

1951
01:27:09,070 --> 01:27:12,020
massage,
but not for a baseball team.

1952
01:27:12,020 --> 01:27:12,490
Like,
hey bro,

1953
01:27:12,491 --> 01:27:14,000
you were hanging out with the baseball 
players.

1954
01:27:14,320 --> 01:27:16,500
Do your.
Here's a Mizzou.

1955
01:27:16,540 --> 01:27:19,610
So if you get a massage from a dude,
you want the lights to be on.

1956
01:27:19,611 --> 01:27:23,000
Do you want like fucking Motley crue 
plaintiff to be in the mall?

1957
01:27:23,330 --> 01:27:27,410
You don't want any scented candles are 
fucking great music.

1958
01:27:27,500 --> 01:27:31,310
Great massages as a Jesus of Hollywood.
What's that mean?

1959
01:27:31,580 --> 01:27:32,600
Kevin?
Kevin,

1960
01:27:33,920 --> 01:27:35,600
but Jesus.
You ever seen that guy that walks around

1961
01:27:35,601 --> 01:27:38,270
Hollywood that looks like Jesus.
His name is Kevin Light.

1962
01:27:38,330 --> 01:27:39,380
No,
I haven't seen them.

1963
01:27:39,381 --> 01:27:42,260
I don't think there was a bunch of guys 
a long time ago.

1964
01:27:42,261 --> 01:27:47,261
It might be confusing them.
There was a member of the religious 

1965
01:27:47,261 --> 01:27:48,810
group that used to walk up and down 
sunset guy would have a cross trapped.

1966
01:27:49,670 --> 01:27:50,930
This is different.
Different.

1967
01:27:50,931 --> 01:27:51,860
Different guy.
Yeah,

1968
01:27:52,220 --> 01:27:57,220
this guy's actually cool.
They would park in front of the comedy 

1969
01:27:57,220 --> 01:27:57,220
store and argue with Comedians.

1970
01:27:57,220 --> 01:28:00,200
I remember I got in this huge argument 
with them because,

1971
01:28:00,201 --> 01:28:00,550
uh,
they,

1972
01:28:00,570 --> 01:28:02,960
they started quoting the Bible and they 
were like saying,

1973
01:28:02,961 --> 01:28:05,060
shit that's not in there.
And I was like,

1974
01:28:05,080 --> 01:28:09,020
it's not even in there.
You don't know the Bible just talking.

1975
01:28:09,140 --> 01:28:12,050
She could go away.
We don't want to hear it because,

1976
01:28:12,250 --> 01:28:17,250
you know,
Ari read the Talmud 12 hours a day for 

1977
01:28:17,250 --> 01:28:17,250
years.
Yeah,

1978
01:28:17,250 --> 01:28:18,440
he knows that he went on religious 
retreat.

1979
01:28:18,450 --> 01:28:23,450
Me Ari was insanely religious.
I don't remember exactly what the 

1980
01:28:23,450 --> 01:28:25,730
fucking person remember those guys 
moving around.

1981
01:28:25,731 --> 01:28:30,690
They're like blonde kids from mature 
cross and with black kid too,

1982
01:28:30,691 --> 01:28:32,480
there was a black kid who was always 
with too.

1983
01:28:32,510 --> 01:28:36,200
We ran them out.
So last we ran them out harshly.

1984
01:28:36,670 --> 01:28:39,230
Here's actually Kevin Right here,
the Hollywood.

1985
01:28:39,260 --> 01:28:39,800
Jesus.
Jesus.

1986
01:28:40,460 --> 01:28:42,230
He's an,
he's a really nice guy.

1987
01:28:42,770 --> 01:28:47,770
And he gives me,
he gives me massages in the public 

1988
01:28:48,280 --> 01:28:48,610
struggle.

1989
01:28:48,620 --> 01:28:50,690
Sit on the chair,
I'll take the tension out.

1990
01:28:50,750 --> 01:28:52,580
He's good.
That's awesome.

1991
01:28:52,640 --> 01:28:56,190
He goes to everybody and he is the best.
Like he will separate your bones,

1992
01:28:56,480 --> 01:28:59,060
your muscles from your bones.
Why does he start a business?

1993
01:28:59,350 --> 01:29:01,410
And he probably could,
will help them out.

1994
01:29:01,900 --> 01:29:03,870
We'll promote it.
Does this guy a homeless guy?

1995
01:29:03,930 --> 01:29:05,670
You're a regular dude.
Regular Dude.

1996
01:29:05,760 --> 01:29:08,460
What does he do for a living?
I don't know exactly,

1997
01:29:08,580 --> 01:29:11,070
but he lives.
He lives in normal life.

1998
01:29:11,100 --> 01:29:16,100
Isn't it funny that you have to ask?
Because when you hear guys like a 

1999
01:29:16,100 --> 01:29:16,590
Hollywood Jesus,
it's like a homeless dude probably.

2000
01:29:16,840 --> 01:29:18,210
You know,
like you don't assume that.

2001
01:29:18,211 --> 01:29:23,211
It's like a guy who's got his shit 
together who just likes dressing up as 

2002
01:29:23,211 --> 01:29:23,211
Jesus.
I think he does.

2003
01:29:23,211 --> 01:29:24,270
It was a rumor.
He does it for his mother.

2004
01:29:24,271 --> 01:29:26,580
His mother was really religious and say 
to honor her,

2005
01:29:26,581 --> 01:29:28,080
he just wants to make people happy.

2006
01:29:28,110 --> 01:29:29,340
It's possible.
I'm like that.

2007
01:29:29,790 --> 01:29:30,510
I don't know.
I don't know.

2008
01:29:30,600 --> 01:29:35,600
It sounds good.
If I was going to write a comic book 

2009
01:29:35,600 --> 01:29:35,600
about the dude,
that's what I would say I would make.

2010
01:29:35,600 --> 01:29:36,810
That is a good angle.
Yeah.

2011
01:29:36,811 --> 01:29:39,660
That would be the would be the inside 
background story.

2012
01:29:39,661 --> 01:29:42,120
If I was doing do like a wolverine 
origins on him.

2013
01:29:42,530 --> 01:29:44,390
I would say his mother,
he promised to his mother,

2014
01:29:44,430 --> 01:29:49,430
mother over a main religious and little 
did he realize that as he was dressing 

2015
01:29:49,430 --> 01:29:51,350
up like Jesus Christ,
Jesus Christ type powers,

2016
01:29:52,140 --> 01:29:54,990
he found them because his mother wanted 
him to dress up like that.

2017
01:29:55,100 --> 01:29:55,680
Well,
he,

2018
01:29:55,681 --> 01:29:56,960
he does.
Honestly,

2019
01:29:56,961 --> 01:30:00,150
he does have Jesus' light qualities if 
you want to look at it that way.

2020
01:30:00,151 --> 01:30:02,390
It's really giving.
He's a good guy.

2021
01:30:02,391 --> 01:30:04,190
Smart.
He's supportive.

2022
01:30:04,220 --> 01:30:06,470
He's a.
He is a good soul.

2023
01:30:06,600 --> 01:30:11,600
That's awesome.
He imagined what we found out the close 

2024
01:30:11,600 --> 01:30:11,600
like that,
like give you powers,

2025
01:30:11,600 --> 01:30:14,490
like if you were a certain cloak,
like there's a certain material that you

2026
01:30:14,491 --> 01:30:16,800
were that allows you to read people's 
minds.

2027
01:30:16,830 --> 01:30:18,960
See the contents of a person's soul.
Brody Stevens.

2028
01:30:19,410 --> 01:30:21,600
Can you see my soul?
Like a lady boy outfit.

2029
01:30:22,620 --> 01:30:23,970
Thanks.
So anyway,

2030
01:30:24,030 --> 01:30:29,030
you go back to this place and you're 
pretty much aware that you're hanging 

2031
01:30:29,030 --> 01:30:29,030
out with

2032
01:30:29,190 --> 01:30:34,190
at this point five percent gay.
And that's due to due to things in 

2033
01:30:34,190 --> 01:30:37,410
college due to two comments,
mostly to comment from three to five.

2034
01:30:37,411 --> 01:30:42,411
Like immediately smell.
You want to give me a real number so we 

2035
01:30:42,411 --> 01:30:45,740
could fucking move on with confidence.
Joe Factory,

2036
01:30:45,800 --> 01:30:49,290
I'm factoring in the bullying ness.
I'm factoring in some baseball.

2037
01:30:49,291 --> 01:30:50,910
I blame you because I don't want to be a
part of.

2038
01:30:50,930 --> 01:30:52,180
You're not.
You're not pulling.

2039
01:30:52,500 --> 01:30:53,130
You know.
I love you.

2040
01:30:53,131 --> 01:30:54,030
Right?
Okay.

2041
01:30:54,120 --> 01:30:58,080
I went there.
Let's say six percent gay,

2042
01:30:58,140 --> 01:31:01,230
six Jesus Christ.
By the end of this story,

2043
01:31:01,790 --> 01:31:03,660
we're going to be at 86 percent.
I went to,

2044
01:31:03,690 --> 01:31:06,360
I went to Bangkok six percent gay and I 
go,

2045
01:31:06,361 --> 01:31:07,980
you know what?
I'm in Bangkok.

2046
01:31:08,580 --> 01:31:13,580
Let me push it to the limit and see what
happens and if I like it,

2047
01:31:14,220 --> 01:31:19,220
I'm into it or if it humiliates me.
No one's around.

2048
01:31:19,980 --> 01:31:24,980
This is my big opportunity and I really 
didn't do that much and I had the chance

2049
01:31:27,500 --> 01:31:29,010
so I didn't do that much.

2050
01:31:29,040 --> 01:31:31,380
What you said,
you got to Bangkok.

2051
01:31:31,440 --> 01:31:33,870
You were 66 percent,
six percent,

2052
01:31:34,020 --> 01:31:37,860
six percent when you got to Bangkok,
but then when you went to the place,

2053
01:31:37,861 --> 01:31:39,660
you knew they were ladyboys.
When you went back,

2054
01:31:39,840 --> 01:31:44,840
when you say you would have to say you 
went a little higher than you were when 

2055
01:31:44,840 --> 01:31:44,840
you got there,
and we'll go,

2056
01:31:44,840 --> 01:31:46,560
well,
it was more out of experience,

2057
01:31:46,680 --> 01:31:49,980
like to check this experience out,
check me out,

2058
01:31:50,010 --> 01:31:52,290
take the temperature.
But it was a good experience.

2059
01:31:53,670 --> 01:31:54,900
It was.
I mean,

2060
01:31:54,901 --> 01:31:57,000
what do you define as a gay experience?
Uh,

2061
01:31:57,080 --> 01:31:58,290
there's a guy in you.

2062
01:32:01,310 --> 01:32:03,280
All right,
hold on.

2063
01:32:04,090 --> 01:32:08,800
Is a transsexual a guy?
It's way closer to a guy than me.

2064
01:32:09,700 --> 01:32:13,030
Okay.
Have guys been fooled?

2065
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:16,720
Make any sense guys.
But you don't even listen to Bebo.

2066
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:18,490
You don't even listen to people.
I said,

2067
01:32:18,530 --> 01:32:20,860
it made I made an error.
I said,

2068
01:32:20,920 --> 01:32:22,360
is it a transexual guy?
No,

2069
01:32:22,361 --> 01:32:24,820
it's not as close to a guy's made.
Correct.

2070
01:32:25,420 --> 01:32:27,400
It's more a woman as a man.
It,

2071
01:32:27,460 --> 01:32:32,460
it looked and felt like a woman.
Here's the reality of transexuals did 

2072
01:32:32,460 --> 01:32:34,240
just the cold hard reality.
It's just chromosomal.

2073
01:32:34,630 --> 01:32:39,630
That's it.
And as far as like behavior and 

2074
01:32:39,630 --> 01:32:42,520
appearance and maybe even like,
like sex,

2075
01:32:42,730 --> 01:32:47,730
like you might enjoy certain aspects of 
sex more with the transsexual than you 

2076
01:32:47,730 --> 01:32:51,040
would an angry,
overweight cigarette smoking woman who's

2077
01:32:51,041 --> 01:32:53,440
got a head like a frying pan,
you know,

2078
01:32:53,441 --> 01:32:55,800
if you found.
What does that transgender woman.

2079
01:32:55,810 --> 01:32:56,920
This is the picture though.

2080
01:32:57,230 --> 01:33:01,270
Brody's with Brian.
Come on man.

2081
01:33:01,520 --> 01:33:03,550
What is the Internet?
You can't do that.

2082
01:33:04,180 --> 01:33:06,430
You're going to ruin everything for 
everybody.

2083
01:33:06,730 --> 01:33:10,150
Keep going.
My point is I would rather have a sexual

2084
01:33:10,151 --> 01:33:15,151
experience with a transgender that was 
really sexy and sweet rather than a big 

2085
01:33:17,590 --> 01:33:19,720
angry woman that's built like a football
player.

2086
01:33:19,780 --> 01:33:21,070
Okay.
I'm with you.

2087
01:33:21,400 --> 01:33:23,080
If you wanted to have a sexual 
experience,

2088
01:33:23,081 --> 01:33:28,081
if you're a man,
most likely want to have a sexual 

2089
01:33:28,081 --> 01:33:28,081
experience with something feminine.
Yes.

2090
01:33:28,081 --> 01:33:29,500
And the reality of femininity versus 
masculinity.

2091
01:33:29,770 --> 01:33:33,760
There's a line where shit gets blurry.
That rhyme.

2092
01:33:33,790 --> 01:33:37,780
That line is big.
Angry Fred flinstone looking women.

2093
01:33:37,840 --> 01:33:41,080
Yes.
Versus like Thai lady.

2094
01:33:41,081 --> 01:33:42,550
Boy,
that's actually very cute.

2095
01:33:42,640 --> 01:33:46,390
Yes.
Where do you go when you're in top?

2096
01:33:46,391 --> 01:33:48,000
Urine.
Fucking off the screen.

2097
01:33:48,040 --> 01:33:48,950
Urine,
urine,

2098
01:33:48,970 --> 01:33:50,710
Thailand.
You're alone.

2099
01:33:50,711 --> 01:33:53,350
You've got.
Even if you're not a Thailand,

2100
01:33:53,380 --> 01:33:58,380
if you're anywhere,
if there's only three people on the 

2101
01:33:58,380 --> 01:33:58,380
planet,
it's you,

2102
01:33:58,380 --> 01:34:01,300
the Thai lady boy and the big Fred 
flintstone looking angry.

2103
01:34:02,180 --> 01:34:05,530
I'm not going to be with the Fred 
Flintstone or boogers in her notes.

2104
01:34:05,560 --> 01:34:07,210
I won't be,
I won't beat breath.

2105
01:34:07,240 --> 01:34:12,050
I'll let her give me a massage.
Her feet smell to transgender,

2106
01:34:12,370 --> 01:34:14,020
irregular curl though.
There was those two.

2107
01:34:14,021 --> 01:34:15,780
You could probably cut a nice young one 
because he thinks,

2108
01:34:15,790 --> 01:34:17,600
I think that would be,
you know,

2109
01:34:17,620 --> 01:34:22,620
a different thing.
I think also there's the feeling of 

2110
01:34:22,620 --> 01:34:23,330
exploitation that comes with having a,
uh,

2111
01:34:23,440 --> 01:34:28,440
having a sexual experience with a 
prostitute that's a female that you 

2112
01:34:28,440 --> 01:34:28,740
don't get if it's a prostitute that's a 
male.

2113
01:34:28,950 --> 01:34:31,930
You know,
if you go to a female prostitute,

2114
01:34:32,140 --> 01:34:35,380
like there's this thing where,
you know,

2115
01:34:35,381 --> 01:34:37,600
if you think about the concept of 
prostitution,

2116
01:34:37,780 --> 01:34:39,520
you think that women are being 
exploited.

2117
01:34:39,670 --> 01:34:42,640
That's like one of the main negative 
aspects of prostitution.

2118
01:34:42,850 --> 01:34:45,340
And then also as a father,
you start thinking,

2119
01:34:45,341 --> 01:34:46,750
well,
why are they prostitutes?

2120
01:34:46,750 --> 01:34:49,570
Most likely because they didn't have a 
good family structure.

2121
01:34:49,571 --> 01:34:52,090
They didn't have a good father figure 
that never a good mother,

2122
01:34:52,150 --> 01:34:53,920
whatever it was,
it's not good.

2123
01:34:54,610 --> 01:34:59,610
Most likely there could be some weird 
that just enjoy sex and don't mind 

2124
01:34:59,610 --> 01:35:00,920
getting paid for it because it's better 
than being a waitress.

2125
01:35:01,070 --> 01:35:03,470
That's possible too,
but when you think about a woman,

2126
01:35:03,680 --> 01:35:08,680
most likely you're thinking about 
someone being sexually manipulated and 

2127
01:35:08,680 --> 01:35:13,331
someone being taken advantage of and 
objectified and you think of a bad 

2128
01:35:13,331 --> 01:35:18,191
situation,
but you don't think about that with a 

2129
01:35:18,191 --> 01:35:19,931
guy you don't.
Especially a guy that used to be a guy 

2130
01:35:19,931 --> 01:35:24,671
who used to be a guy and then became a 
girl like and decided to do it because 

2131
01:35:24,671 --> 01:35:28,931
he wanted to do it.
Like he made the choice wanting to do 

2132
01:35:28,931 --> 01:35:28,931
it.
Felt like that's who he is.

2133
01:35:29,030 --> 01:35:31,730
He's better than they wanted to be.

2134
01:35:31,790 --> 01:35:36,790
Or did he like made a choice that you 
definitely make the choice to have 

2135
01:35:36,790 --> 01:35:39,641
surgery,
but you feel it almost like you have to 

2136
01:35:39,641 --> 01:35:39,641
get it done?
I can't tell.

2137
01:35:39,641 --> 01:35:44,590
I mean,
there's no way I could tell you what 

2138
01:35:44,590 --> 01:35:46,541
they feel,
but I would assume that they're telling 

2139
01:35:46,541 --> 01:35:48,671
the truth and when I've talked to,
I mean we had bucking Joel on the 

2140
01:35:48,671 --> 01:35:51,410
podcast who is a transgender,
a woman to man and you know,

2141
01:35:51,411 --> 01:35:54,920
he says that he's always known inside 
that he should be a man.

2142
01:35:55,120 --> 01:35:56,610
I mean,
his personality was always,

2143
01:35:56,770 --> 01:36:01,770
and that's the only time he was ever 
happy was when he was allowed to be a 

2144
01:36:01,770 --> 01:36:03,010
man because this person feel real brody.
Well,

2145
01:36:03,100 --> 01:36:08,100
I went out from the path here,
the from the path here,

2146
01:36:08,301 --> 01:36:11,030
because I think what we're talking about
is actually a very important subject.

2147
01:36:11,031 --> 01:36:12,890
It's real.
Have to define it very clearly.

2148
01:36:13,010 --> 01:36:13,370
No,
no.

2149
01:36:13,430 --> 01:36:15,230
Hold on a second.
You have to define this.

2150
01:36:15,680 --> 01:36:16,460
Go Pee,
pee.

2151
01:36:16,480 --> 01:36:17,480
Okay.
Can I come right back?

2152
01:36:17,490 --> 01:36:18,530
Hey,
now we're not gonna.

2153
01:36:18,531 --> 01:36:21,620
Let you back in this door out there 
punching a code.

2154
01:36:22,890 --> 01:36:27,890
I don't think that any one of us can 
tell someone what they feel inside their

2155
01:36:28,221 --> 01:36:33,221
body,
and I've talked to way too many people 

2156
01:36:33,221 --> 01:36:34,901
that say that they.
They know that they should have been a 

2157
01:36:34,901 --> 01:36:34,901
man or they know that they should have 
been a woman.

2158
01:36:34,970 --> 01:36:37,970
If that's the case,
if they're saying that I.

2159
01:36:37,970 --> 01:36:40,500
You can't argue with that.
The whole,

2160
01:36:40,610 --> 01:36:43,100
if you look at the spectrum of human 
fuck ups,

2161
01:36:43,430 --> 01:36:48,430
you know the genetic abnormalities that 
the variations in color of skin and 

2162
01:36:50,451 --> 01:36:55,451
color of hair and the size of teeth and 
all the different variations of human 

2163
01:36:55,451 --> 01:36:59,711
beings.
Of course some people were supposed to 

2164
01:36:59,711 --> 01:36:59,711
be boys and didn't come out.

2165
01:36:59,711 --> 01:37:04,570
Boys absolutely no doubt about it and I 
think one day they're going to be able 

2166
01:37:04,641 --> 01:37:09,641
to do something where they give these 
people some sort of a genetic 

2167
01:37:09,641 --> 01:37:13,211
manipulation and they're going to 
literally turn them into double x 

2168
01:37:13,211 --> 01:37:13,370
chromosome women.
And I think,

2169
01:37:13,460 --> 01:37:17,150
I think that's not that thing.
That's the beginning of like the ability

2170
01:37:17,151 --> 01:37:20,570
to manipulate the human genome,
the ability to change a person's DNA.

2171
01:37:20,810 --> 01:37:22,640
But until then,
what do they have?

2172
01:37:22,641 --> 01:37:23,590
They have,
they,

2173
01:37:23,600 --> 01:37:28,600
you know,
they have surgery and they have a 

2174
01:37:28,600 --> 01:37:28,600
hormonal,
you know,

2175
01:37:28,600 --> 01:37:28,600
hormone,
hormonal treatments,

2176
01:37:28,600 --> 01:37:32,390
but if you had to choose between a guy 
who did that,

2177
01:37:33,230 --> 01:37:38,230
a male born male who did that and became
like a really sexy transgender or 

2178
01:37:38,810 --> 01:37:43,810
disgusting angry woman who hates men,
discussed getting disgusting,

2179
01:37:44,090 --> 01:37:46,190
angry eight women that hates,
then he would go with that.

2180
01:37:47,870 --> 01:37:49,650
Marius.
You're Alaris.

2181
01:37:49,790 --> 01:37:54,790
There's only three people on the planet.
Wait on the planet through the angry 

2182
01:37:55,590 --> 01:37:56,240
project.

2183
01:37:56,290 --> 01:38:00,030
You're going to try to turn it into a 
lady with a big giant,

2184
01:38:00,031 --> 01:38:03,540
stinky feet for a really beautiful lady.
Boy.

2185
01:38:03,900 --> 01:38:08,900
Definitely number one.
I would definitely be with a woman show 

2186
01:38:08,900 --> 01:38:08,900
weight or you wouldn't be able to lady.
Boy,

2187
01:38:08,900 --> 01:38:12,280
I don't even know if I saw one that 
posts like penises,

2188
01:38:12,610 --> 01:38:17,610
postsurgery peanuts as I wouldn't even 
look at it because you don't have to 

2189
01:38:17,610 --> 01:38:20,811
look at it.
How about you don't have to look at it 

2190
01:38:20,811 --> 01:38:20,811
how much it comes with special goggles.
So,

2191
01:38:20,811 --> 01:38:23,080
so Brian,
like those three d glasses you get,

2192
01:38:23,520 --> 01:38:24,930
you look at it,
you get it through that.

2193
01:38:24,960 --> 01:38:26,670
She looks perfect.
Can I ask a question,

2194
01:38:26,671 --> 01:38:31,671
Brian?
And look at this three people on the 

2195
01:38:31,671 --> 01:38:31,671
whole planet,
most likely I'd kill myself.

2196
01:38:31,671 --> 01:38:31,671
Let me tell you something.
It's three people on the planet.

2197
01:38:31,671 --> 01:38:33,240
I'm going to go to the highest fucking 
mountain.

2198
01:38:33,450 --> 01:38:34,530
I'm going to stand there,
look at it,

2199
01:38:34,531 --> 01:38:39,531
and I'm going to say fuck it and take a 
swan dive and then we're going to have 

2200
01:38:39,531 --> 01:38:40,560
to start fresh because I'll be the last 
bail on the planet.

2201
01:38:40,561 --> 01:38:42,840
There'll be no impregnated people.
And those two people are gonna die.

2202
01:38:42,841 --> 01:38:45,990
And that's going to be a wrap.
Unless they milk my balls for sperm when

2203
01:38:45,991 --> 01:38:48,210
they find my dead body within 24 hour 
period,

2204
01:38:48,410 --> 01:38:53,410
my sperm staying alive,
most likely the human species ends 

2205
01:38:53,410 --> 01:38:53,410
there,
Brian.

2206
01:38:53,410 --> 01:38:53,760
So yeah,
go with the tranny.

2207
01:38:53,910 --> 01:38:55,020
Is that okay?
You know,

2208
01:38:55,080 --> 01:38:59,010
transgender,
you can I ask one quick question?

2209
01:38:59,700 --> 01:39:01,830
I would be sitting there eating that big
fat,

2210
01:39:01,831 --> 01:39:06,831
real pussy getting stabbed.
I don't know that it was real pleased.

2211
01:39:08,670 --> 01:39:09,350
Pleasure.
Brian.

2212
01:39:09,351 --> 01:39:14,351
Please show if and when,
obviously I'm talking about on the 

2213
01:39:14,351 --> 01:39:18,431
podcast and let's say this topic does a 
appear on my show.

2214
01:39:18,830 --> 01:39:20,360
This lady,
boy,

2215
01:39:20,361 --> 01:39:25,361
10 percent issue.
Am I going to receive a lot of heat on 

2216
01:39:25,361 --> 01:39:25,670
it?
Not only because

2217
01:39:25,700 --> 01:39:28,610
from who?
I don't know from America.

2218
01:39:28,670 --> 01:39:29,930
Fuck them,
man.

2219
01:39:30,080 --> 01:39:32,180
You're going to receive heat from people
no matter what.

2220
01:39:32,210 --> 01:39:37,210
No matter what you do,
there's going to be people that don't 

2221
01:39:37,210 --> 01:39:37,210
like this to going to be people that 
don't like that.

2222
01:39:37,210 --> 01:39:39,530
Dude.
You can't avoid heat if you're public,

2223
01:39:39,531 --> 01:39:41,420
you get heat.
Yeah,

2224
01:39:41,421 --> 01:39:43,100
but this is.
This is personal.

2225
01:39:43,101 --> 01:39:45,350
Public.
I've seen Neil degrasse tyson take heat.

2226
01:39:45,980 --> 01:39:47,390
Who's that?
How dare you?

2227
01:39:47,900 --> 01:39:49,370
You don't know anything.
I don't know what.

2228
01:39:49,371 --> 01:39:51,080
Don't say.
I don't know anything.

2229
01:39:51,410 --> 01:39:52,880
I follow sports.
Joe.

2230
01:39:52,940 --> 01:39:54,710
That's his ball.
Nothing about science.

2231
01:39:54,740 --> 01:39:55,490
Nothing about space.

2232
01:39:56,250 --> 01:39:58,050
I've heard of stuff.
I heard of Bill Nye.

2233
01:39:58,051 --> 01:40:02,070
I've heard a lot.
I love weather.

2234
01:40:02,071 --> 01:40:04,500
I love geography.
I like geography.

2235
01:40:05,250 --> 01:40:07,360
I'm into the moon.
Hi,

2236
01:40:09,220 --> 01:40:13,380
I'm so you're in Thailand.
Oh Gosh.

2237
01:40:13,600 --> 01:40:15,580
Here you go.
You're with the ladyboy.

2238
01:40:15,610 --> 01:40:17,340
You go back.
You go to the club,

2239
01:40:17,540 --> 01:40:18,420
right?
Sit down.

2240
01:40:18,540 --> 01:40:20,910
How do you know right away that this 
used to be a guy?

2241
01:40:21,380 --> 01:40:22,420
Oh definitely.
Well,

2242
01:40:22,421 --> 01:40:22,850
you know.
No,

2243
01:40:22,910 --> 01:40:23,410
no,
no,

2244
01:40:23,420 --> 01:40:23,730
no.
Let me.

2245
01:40:24,540 --> 01:40:27,760
It used to be is whatever.
I didn't see an Adam's apple.

2246
01:40:28,030 --> 01:40:33,030
Do you remember the episode of the 
mantra that we did with a transgender 

2247
01:40:33,030 --> 01:40:36,421
woman who is beautiful?
Her name was like vanity or something 

2248
01:40:36,421 --> 01:40:37,060
like that.
Vaguely.

2249
01:40:37,100 --> 01:40:40,120
Remember that dude.
She was like really?

2250
01:40:40,121 --> 01:40:44,050
Pretty like Whoa,
like stunningly beautiful and was born a

2251
01:40:44,060 --> 01:40:47,980
man and we did a segment where the guy 
got strapped to a table.

2252
01:40:47,981 --> 01:40:51,520
It's called make me hard and we put a.
I was strapped to a table.

2253
01:40:51,521 --> 01:40:56,521
We put a light box over.
Dick would go off when he got an 

2254
01:40:56,521 --> 01:40:58,750
erection,
so of course we controlled the button so

2255
01:40:58,751 --> 01:41:03,751
it'd be like whenever like majors were 
eating bananas or we had this 

2256
01:41:03,751 --> 01:41:07,860
transgender get out and the transgender 
does a dance for this guy and then she 

2257
01:41:07,860 --> 01:41:09,070
puts a whip cream on her nipples.
The guys sucks.

2258
01:41:09,071 --> 01:41:10,030
The whip cream,
offered tests.

2259
01:41:10,031 --> 01:41:12,820
She had big fake tits and then she pulls
out a promo.

2260
01:41:12,840 --> 01:41:16,260
I remember that she pulls out a penis at
the end of this fucking light.

2261
01:41:16,440 --> 01:41:17,920
The light starts flashing pain,
Bang,

2262
01:41:17,921 --> 01:41:18,340
Bang,
Bang,

2263
01:41:18,341 --> 01:41:18,960
Bang.
It was saying,

2264
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:22,250
I remember that her penis looked like 
like a,

2265
01:41:22,600 --> 01:41:25,720
like a primate penis that had been 
poisoned.

2266
01:41:26,110 --> 01:41:31,110
Like if you took a champ and you 
poisoned the champ and he saw his dick 

2267
01:41:31,110 --> 01:41:32,230
after he was dying of poison.
Let me ask the question.

2268
01:41:32,590 --> 01:41:37,590
What happens to the penis was just a 
regular looking penis on a beautiful 

2269
01:41:37,590 --> 01:41:39,330
woman with breasts.
Good skin.

2270
01:41:39,331 --> 01:41:40,690
That'd be an issue.
Hair.

2271
01:41:42,830 --> 01:41:45,430
The penis would be an issue for sure.
If you had to do something with it.

2272
01:41:45,700 --> 01:41:48,580
Like if the deal was like,
like she,

2273
01:41:48,590 --> 01:41:51,430
she's beautiful but she's got a dick and
she's going to blow you,

2274
01:41:51,431 --> 01:41:52,390
but you got to blow her.

2275
01:41:52,500 --> 01:41:54,520
No,
I'm out.

2276
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:57,600
I'm out.
You said that's where you're out.

2277
01:41:58,140 --> 01:42:00,680
You're out on that.
Okay.

2278
01:42:00,710 --> 01:42:02,260
If you're at on that,
I'm out with you,

2279
01:42:02,290 --> 01:42:02,660
Joe.
Who?

2280
01:42:02,710 --> 01:42:03,600
Okay.
We're both out.

2281
01:42:03,630 --> 01:42:05,870
Okay.
I guess I'm 10 percent gain.

2282
01:42:07,260 --> 01:42:09,330
There you go.
I guess September.

2283
01:42:09,331 --> 01:42:10,610
Second.
Thank you.

2284
01:42:10,660 --> 01:42:10,920
Um,

2285
01:42:11,160 --> 01:42:12,550
so,
you know,

2286
01:42:12,580 --> 01:42:14,800
it's.
Yes.

2287
01:42:14,801 --> 01:42:16,510
So you sit in there?
Yes.

2288
01:42:16,511 --> 01:42:18,130
I loved it.
And what,

2289
01:42:18,190 --> 01:42:18,880
what,
uh,

2290
01:42:20,190 --> 01:42:25,190
did you,
were there any of them in they're 

2291
01:42:25,190 --> 01:42:25,280
actually born women or was it all lady 
boys?

2292
01:42:25,870 --> 01:42:26,830
Do you know,
I,

2293
01:42:26,850 --> 01:42:29,650
I probably,
I mean most likely made the lady running

2294
01:42:29,651 --> 01:42:31,300
the place was a,
was a woman,

2295
01:42:31,301 --> 01:42:34,540
but I think most of the dancers were,
were,

2296
01:42:34,590 --> 01:42:38,710
were male at birth and um,
but it's part of that culture.

2297
01:42:38,711 --> 01:42:43,711
Just to let you know,
it's very accepted to see ladyboys all 

2298
01:42:43,711 --> 01:42:46,000
around working at starbucks,
walking down the street.

2299
01:42:46,180 --> 01:42:48,040
Why do you think that is?
I don't know.

2300
01:42:48,041 --> 01:42:49,910
It's just a,
I don't know,

2301
01:42:49,940 --> 01:42:54,940
it's a different culture over there,
but is it a cultural choice or is it a 

2302
01:42:54,940 --> 01:42:57,910
genetic thing where there's a great 
percentage of people that feel like they

2303
01:42:57,911 --> 01:43:02,911
should have been a woman?
I think there's something about 

2304
01:43:02,911 --> 01:43:02,911
genetics.

2305
01:43:02,911 --> 01:43:04,600
I don't know about the,
I don't know if like Asians are the Thai

2306
01:43:04,601 --> 01:43:08,890
people are more apt to having that gene.
I would wonder if there's some stats for

2307
01:43:08,891 --> 01:43:12,760
that as far as like women to men,
transgenders like buck,

2308
01:43:12,850 --> 01:43:17,850
buck angel.
I wonder if there's some stats that 

2309
01:43:17,850 --> 01:43:20,551
show,
like what countries have more 

2310
01:43:20,551 --> 01:43:20,900
transgender women to men.
If type question.

2311
01:43:21,310 --> 01:43:24,820
I wonder if talent is Thailand actually 
have more transgender men.

2312
01:43:24,821 --> 01:43:26,920
It's an accepted part of the culture.
I mean,

2313
01:43:26,950 --> 01:43:31,950
I bet you down in Brazil there's a lot 
and it's accepted and maybe accepted 

2314
01:43:31,950 --> 01:43:32,680
down there.
Right?

2315
01:43:33,190 --> 01:43:34,350
So,
um,

2316
01:43:35,020 --> 01:43:40,020
you can tell us as much as you want 
about this experience where you can 

2317
01:43:40,020 --> 01:43:40,020
enter right here.
I,

2318
01:43:40,020 --> 01:43:40,020
I,
I'm willing to talk.

2319
01:43:40,020 --> 01:43:44,940
I'm.
The only thing I'm thinking about is I 

2320
01:43:44,940 --> 01:43:46,891
don't want to give too much away on this
show and I will keep going.

2321
01:43:47,210 --> 01:43:49,240
People are going to see the show anyway.
That's awesome.

2322
01:43:49,300 --> 01:43:54,300
You've actually already said it on a 
podcast before and we got you up to 12 

2323
01:43:54,300 --> 01:43:54,300
percent gay.
Forget that.

2324
01:43:54,300 --> 01:43:54,620
Wait a minute,
wait a minute.

2325
01:43:54,621 --> 01:43:55,970
When you brought them up to 12?
Yeah,

2326
01:43:55,971 --> 01:44:00,971
we got him up to 12 because there was 
something else that he does pr right 

2327
01:44:00,971 --> 01:44:00,971
now.
Yeah,

2328
01:44:00,971 --> 01:44:04,220
I got confused in some peer pressure.
I feel like you guys will me a couple 

2329
01:44:04,220 --> 01:44:06,140
more questions and bullied them into an 
extra percentage of being gay.

2330
01:44:06,560 --> 01:44:09,470
That's how he got here.
He said he got bullied into being three.

2331
01:44:09,680 --> 01:44:14,680
He might've been how it was walking.
I think it was because you still like 

2332
01:44:14,680 --> 01:44:17,810
pop click on like guy porn at home or 
something.

2333
01:44:17,811 --> 01:44:22,811
I forget what I.
I'll tell you what

2334
01:44:25,360 --> 01:44:30,350
you can click on what that percentage.
That's residue percentage.

2335
01:44:31,260 --> 01:44:32,590
What are you working at?
Chernobyl.

2336
01:44:34,470 --> 01:44:37,700
Not Describing fucking nuclear power.
Power.

2337
01:44:37,910 --> 01:44:41,380
All.
I came in about being gay residential.

2338
01:44:41,480 --> 01:44:46,480
I came back quantum energy and on his 
back I had at quantum gayness is what we

2339
01:44:47,580 --> 01:44:52,580
had access to you porn and I did wander 
and click.

2340
01:44:56,600 --> 01:45:01,600
It's something I would never ever do and
it's something that it's,

2341
01:45:05,680 --> 01:45:06,480
you know,
it's like,

2342
01:45:06,481 --> 01:45:09,440
did people see brokeback mountain?
Did it any straight guy?

2343
01:45:09,441 --> 01:45:12,330
See brokeback mountain.
I'm sure there were.

2344
01:45:12,620 --> 01:45:17,620
I'm sure they saw two guys making love 
in the movie or whatever and they 

2345
01:45:17,791 --> 01:45:22,791
actually felt good about knowing these 
guys loved each other and it may even 

2346
01:45:23,670 --> 01:45:28,670
aroused a straight guy knowing that two 
guys were passionately in love with each

2347
01:45:29,131 --> 01:45:29,490
other.

2348
01:45:31,320 --> 01:45:32,550
Let me take it from here.
First of all,

2349
01:45:32,870 --> 01:45:34,980
if you felt that from watching that 
movie,

2350
01:45:35,040 --> 01:45:40,040
it means you don't have a sense of humor
and you probably weren't there with 

2351
01:45:40,040 --> 01:45:43,521
another man who also has a sense of 
humor because if you did as soon as jake

2352
01:45:43,621 --> 01:45:45,570
ellenberger no,
what's his name?

2353
01:45:45,571 --> 01:45:46,740
J Dot Gillman Hall,
sorry.

2354
01:45:46,741 --> 01:45:51,741
Jake Ellenberger,
who's an MMA fighter Gillen Burger 

2355
01:45:51,741 --> 01:45:52,720
ellenberger is a professional mixed 
martial artist.

2356
01:45:53,740 --> 01:45:58,740
Gillen Hall spits on his hand and then 
shoves his dick right into right into 

2357
01:46:00,481 --> 01:46:02,860
heath,
but I don't think you would.

2358
01:46:02,970 --> 01:46:05,120
You'd have to laugh a little.
I mean,

2359
01:46:05,190 --> 01:46:07,030
I didn't see the movie.
We're only human.

2360
01:46:07,160 --> 01:46:09,380
Shane.
Somebody's got aroused by that.

2361
01:46:09,381 --> 01:46:11,060
Who was not gay?

2362
01:46:11,700 --> 01:46:13,990
Oh boy.
I'm not sure I agree with you there.

2363
01:46:14,350 --> 01:46:17,350
I think if that scene a rouse you.
I think you're probably right.

2364
01:46:17,540 --> 01:46:22,540
I'm not saying the scene arouse you.
Maybe that to humans are in so love 

2365
01:46:24,950 --> 01:46:29,950
together and it's.
It's passionate and it's almost wrong.

2366
01:46:30,370 --> 01:46:32,010
It's taboo.
Taboo.

2367
01:46:32,680 --> 01:46:36,340
There you go.
It's almost taboo to say that.

2368
01:46:36,341 --> 01:46:38,890
You know what?
That scene from brokeback mountain,

2369
01:46:39,960 --> 01:46:40,510
it,
it,

2370
01:46:40,530 --> 01:46:40,990
it,
it,

2371
01:46:41,010 --> 01:46:43,960
it did start something,
but it didn't.

2372
01:46:43,961 --> 01:46:46,320
I never saw the movie.
I never saw them.

2373
01:46:46,780 --> 01:46:48,250
I saw it.
I never saw again married.

2374
01:46:48,340 --> 01:46:53,340
The relationship.
Heath herring and Jake Gyllenhaal was 

2375
01:46:53,340 --> 01:46:55,710
very similar to one of my jokes is that 
I think,

2376
01:46:55,770 --> 01:47:00,000
I don't believe in bisexual men.
I think there's gay men and then there's

2377
01:47:00,001 --> 01:47:05,001
really gullible,
straight dudes who get talked into 

2378
01:47:05,001 --> 01:47:05,001
blowing crafty.
Gay Guys.

2379
01:47:05,140 --> 01:47:08,250
Me,
I'm 10 percent gay and I'm not sure what

2380
01:47:08,251 --> 01:47:13,251
that movie was was j dot Guillen Hall 
was the really crafty gay dude and he.

2381
01:47:13,650 --> 01:47:14,760
Richard,
what is his name?

2382
01:47:15,590 --> 01:47:17,280
Ledger Ledger.
Heath Ledger.

2383
01:47:17,281 --> 01:47:20,640
I call them heath herring.
Heath herring.

2384
01:47:20,860 --> 01:47:22,320
Heath Ledger.
Sorry.

2385
01:47:22,321 --> 01:47:24,780
Heath heath herring is another MMA 
fighter.

2386
01:47:25,260 --> 01:47:30,260
He's ledger was just like sort of a a 
nine volt battery brain dude.

2387
01:47:30,750 --> 01:47:35,750
Just kind of a dude.
Wasn't that smart and he was out there 

2388
01:47:35,750 --> 01:47:38,700
alone and hanging out with this guy and 
a bunch of fucking sheep around and just

2389
01:47:38,701 --> 01:47:39,960
got into it.
Fuck it.

2390
01:47:40,470 --> 01:47:42,660
Got talked into it,
but it ruined his life.

2391
01:47:43,080 --> 01:47:45,330
Wrecked his life.
He really wasn't even gay.

2392
01:47:45,331 --> 01:47:47,530
He was talked into.
It was.

2393
01:47:47,820 --> 01:47:51,670
He had a family.
They just say,

2394
01:47:51,710 --> 01:47:53,760
I want to get talked into it.
You want to.

2395
01:47:53,761 --> 01:47:55,100
I would not.
Oh,

2396
01:47:55,140 --> 01:48:00,140
I thought you said I want.
I'm hearing things back to Thailand with

2397
01:48:01,710 --> 01:48:04,080
a lady boy.
And how does it escalate?

2398
01:48:05,990 --> 01:48:09,990
We went to the second floor.
What do you think when you're walking up

2399
01:48:09,991 --> 01:48:12,300
those stairs?
Biggest mistake of my life.

2400
01:48:12,450 --> 01:48:12,900
No,
I.

2401
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:15,780
You know what?
I'll tell you what I wanted to see.

2402
01:48:16,470 --> 01:48:21,470
See if I can get it up.
See if I had the temptation.

2403
01:48:22,321 --> 01:48:25,200
I could do whatever I want.
This is my big chance.

2404
01:48:25,201 --> 01:48:26,400
Everyone says,
brody,

2405
01:48:26,401 --> 01:48:27,960
you're gay.
You're gay.

2406
01:48:29,580 --> 01:48:34,190
I know it's eight now I'm in a room in 
Thailand.

2407
01:48:35,730 --> 01:48:38,390
You like,
I'll show you.

2408
01:48:42,490 --> 01:48:43,030
Oh,

2409
01:48:43,510 --> 01:48:47,820
and you know what?
I don't need to go into detail,

2410
01:48:47,850 --> 01:48:52,850
but I pushed it to the limit as far as I
could go.

2411
01:48:54,960 --> 01:48:56,820
Okay.
Did I perform?

2412
01:48:56,880 --> 01:48:59,580
I will go on record saying no,
I did not.

2413
01:48:59,640 --> 01:49:04,640
Never have.
Don't want to perform oral on a man.

2414
01:49:04,860 --> 01:49:06,210
Can I go on record saying that?

2415
01:49:06,370 --> 01:49:07,070
Gotcha.
But what,

2416
01:49:07,071 --> 01:49:10,210
what happened?
Well that didn't happen.

2417
01:49:12,080 --> 01:49:15,760
Okay.
What didn't happen also is kissing,

2418
01:49:15,820 --> 01:49:18,460
kissing.
Didn't want to kiss a man.

2419
01:49:18,461 --> 01:49:20,350
To be clear.
There was no kissing,

2420
01:49:20,410 --> 01:49:22,480
no kissing,
no race car driving,

2421
01:49:22,810 --> 01:49:26,000
no meteorite impact.
Many of the things didn't tell you.

2422
01:49:26,020 --> 01:49:31,020
Make an unromantic I'm sorry.
I apologize.

2423
01:49:41,700 --> 01:49:46,700
I'm very romantic guy.
Go on and

2424
01:49:48,310 --> 01:49:53,310
you know some stuff I tried,
you know,

2425
01:49:54,760 --> 01:49:56,920
touched this.
I did not.

2426
01:49:56,980 --> 01:49:58,920
I'll be honest.
I looked,

2427
01:49:58,960 --> 01:50:01,390
I looked at it.
How close?

2428
01:50:01,940 --> 01:50:02,370
No,
no,

2429
01:50:03,750 --> 01:50:04,510
no,
no.

2430
01:50:04,570 --> 01:50:05,590
Probably.

2431
01:50:07,190 --> 01:50:08,930
What is that?
Three feet.

2432
01:50:08,960 --> 01:50:11,870
Two and a half feet from the ass or the 
Dick.

2433
01:50:12,520 --> 01:50:17,520
I looked at the penis as a difference 
because if you're three feet from the 

2434
01:50:17,520 --> 01:50:18,430
Dick,
that's a safe judgment time.

2435
01:50:18,431 --> 01:50:19,930
You can move left.
You can move,

2436
01:50:19,931 --> 01:50:20,680
right?
Correct.

2437
01:50:20,770 --> 01:50:22,360
Three feet from the ass.
No,

2438
01:50:22,450 --> 01:50:25,000
I wasn't there.
You're basically there.

2439
01:50:25,090 --> 01:50:25,600
Okay.
No,

2440
01:50:25,601 --> 01:50:25,900
no,
no.

2441
01:50:25,960 --> 01:50:26,950
Time out.
Time out.

2442
01:50:26,980 --> 01:50:30,280
Are you saying three feet?
I'm talking about my face.

2443
01:50:30,610 --> 01:50:32,740
Your face.
Three feet from his dick or his ass.

2444
01:50:32,770 --> 01:50:35,020
Can I say one thing?
Can I say another thing?

2445
01:50:35,050 --> 01:50:36,160
Yes,
you can see whatever you want.

2446
01:50:36,190 --> 01:50:41,190
Never did.
Nor do I want to take my face and put it

2447
01:50:42,040 --> 01:50:47,040
in the advance ass.
Can I go on record saying that now we 

2448
01:50:47,501 --> 01:50:50,080
know if there was any debate before it's
been squashed.

2449
01:50:50,081 --> 01:50:55,081
Okay.
Now your turn it around and I'm in 

2450
01:50:55,081 --> 01:50:55,810
Bangkok and I go,
well,

2451
01:50:56,380 --> 01:50:57,550
people,
Sam gay,

2452
01:50:58,770 --> 01:51:01,240
turn around.
Let me look at it.

2453
01:51:03,470 --> 01:51:04,940
Far Away.
How far away?

2454
01:51:05,630 --> 01:51:08,420
Three feet from the deck?
Yeah.

2455
01:51:08,540 --> 01:51:09,710
What's it look like?
Is it hard?

2456
01:51:09,711 --> 01:51:12,080
At least I know.
I'll tell you what.

2457
01:51:12,200 --> 01:51:13,730
No,
it was.

2458
01:51:14,470 --> 01:51:16,970
It was what you described.
It wasn't normal.

2459
01:51:16,971 --> 01:51:19,360
Something happened to.
It has been poisoned.

2460
01:51:19,640 --> 01:51:21,230
Whatever.
There's some chemical.

2461
01:51:21,231 --> 01:51:25,550
Start injecting your body with estrogen.
I would assume you'd Dick shrivels up.

2462
01:51:25,820 --> 01:51:27,530
It's not necessary anymore and it knows 
it.

2463
01:51:28,010 --> 01:51:30,560
Just like when you inject your body with
testosterone.

2464
01:51:30,561 --> 01:51:33,290
If you're a woman,
you're not supposed to have men's levels

2465
01:51:33,291 --> 01:51:35,870
of testosterone.
Plus those women in bodybuilders,

2466
01:51:35,930 --> 01:51:38,570
they grow.
Dick's think their clinic extends.

2467
01:51:38,840 --> 01:51:42,110
It's like when you find a dead body 
hanging for like that's been there for a

2468
01:51:42,110 --> 01:51:44,870
week.
It's stretched and different things.

2469
01:51:46,250 --> 01:51:47,300
Different thing.
Brilliant.

2470
01:51:48,620 --> 01:51:51,050
Okay.
So the Deq was soft.

2471
01:51:51,350 --> 01:51:52,700
We didn't touch it.
Okay.

2472
01:51:52,701 --> 01:51:55,280
But when,
when you tapped it just to see what it's

2473
01:51:55,281 --> 01:51:59,570
like to say I'm officially touched it.
I've never touched a man's penis ever.

2474
01:51:59,610 --> 01:52:04,610
How do you,
how do you even know that you're in a 

2475
01:52:04,610 --> 01:52:04,610
dream?
Unless you touch it,

2476
01:52:04,610 --> 01:52:04,610
right?
I guess,

2477
01:52:04,610 --> 01:52:07,410
yeah,
just touched with no stimulation at all.

2478
01:52:07,440 --> 01:52:09,720
It's like that thing that you do when 
you're lucid dreaming,

2479
01:52:10,310 --> 01:52:13,200
um,
the way you like practice lucid dreaming

2480
01:52:13,201 --> 01:52:18,201
is by walking around your house and 
every time you get to a door knob or 

2481
01:52:18,201 --> 01:52:18,201
doorway,
you're knocking the doorway.

2482
01:52:18,480 --> 01:52:20,760
Am I dreaming?
And if you're not dreaming,

2483
01:52:21,450 --> 01:52:23,400
you feel it.
You knock on the door.

2484
01:52:23,550 --> 01:52:28,550
But if you're dreaming,
your hand just goes right through and 

2485
01:52:28,550 --> 01:52:28,550
you go,
oh my goodness,

2486
01:52:28,550 --> 01:52:29,130
I'm dreaming.
And that's how you lucid dream.

2487
01:52:30,100 --> 01:52:34,200
So it's like a meditative device.
So whenever you see a Dick,

2488
01:52:34,640 --> 01:52:36,420
you should thump it and go,
am I dreaming?

2489
01:52:36,960 --> 01:52:38,630
No,
no.

2490
01:52:38,690 --> 01:52:41,110
I got set up here.
I just got set up.

2491
01:52:41,120 --> 01:52:45,730
We all dream about.
Joe Knows Dick.

2492
01:52:45,860 --> 01:52:45,980
I

2493
01:52:45,980 --> 01:52:50,900
don't want it to why you don't even want
to touch it,

2494
01:52:50,901 --> 01:52:55,901
but you did.
But you did touch her as a doctor with 

2495
01:52:55,901 --> 01:52:59,680
touch as a doctor.
When did you get it to officially say 

2496
01:52:59,680 --> 01:52:59,990
I've done it.
What did you do?

2497
01:52:59,991 --> 01:53:04,991
The residency in Miami State,
Arizona State.

2498
01:53:05,600 --> 01:53:07,700
Enjoy it.
Okay,

2499
01:53:07,740 --> 01:53:08,900
Doctor,
please consult.

2500
01:53:11,330 --> 01:53:16,130
There was no kissing.
I don't want to smell good.

2501
01:53:16,550 --> 01:53:18,350
She smelled it was a girl.
Well,

2502
01:53:18,351 --> 01:53:19,850
okay,
what point in time.

2503
01:53:19,940 --> 01:53:23,510
Here's the question,
when you become a transgender,

2504
01:53:24,350 --> 01:53:29,350
when do we decide to call you a girl?
Is it when you make the choice?

2505
01:53:30,470 --> 01:53:34,340
Because if you still have a penis,
becomes very.

2506
01:53:34,341 --> 01:53:36,530
I don't know if you have to have your 
penis cut off.

2507
01:53:36,860 --> 01:53:40,430
I don't know if you have to be on 
certain certain,

2508
01:53:40,431 --> 01:53:41,600
uh,
you know,

2509
01:53:41,630 --> 01:53:45,830
medication hormones.
I guess it's just for a courtesy.

2510
01:53:46,280 --> 01:53:51,280
It's just the person's choice.
Like if you decided tomorrow that you 

2511
01:53:51,280 --> 01:53:55,400
want it to be a eustice,
this other girl's name.

2512
01:53:56,780 --> 01:53:58,790
What's the girl's name?
Dub becky.

2513
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:00,950
Becky Warner Evens.
No,

2514
01:54:01,340 --> 01:54:02,300
you,
me,

2515
01:54:02,780 --> 01:54:04,800
you decide to be a woman.
Okay.

2516
01:54:04,880 --> 01:54:05,540
Okay.
Okay.

2517
01:54:05,541 --> 01:54:07,700
Becky Stevens.
I would start calling you a woman.

2518
01:54:07,760 --> 01:54:11,600
I would start calling you out of respect
out of respect.

2519
01:54:11,601 --> 01:54:15,530
And I'm taking hormones out of respect.
But did you know that there's queer?

2520
01:54:16,520 --> 01:54:18,980
Do you know a queers?
Those are like gay guys.

2521
01:54:18,981 --> 01:54:21,710
Like you've taken the word over?
No,

2522
01:54:22,510 --> 01:54:27,510
I'll lbtq t lesbian as lesbians.
Bisexuals,

2523
01:54:29,200 --> 01:54:32,390
a gay transgender,
queer.

2524
01:54:32,870 --> 01:54:34,520
The queer ones,
a strange one.

2525
01:54:34,850 --> 01:54:37,100
And the queer one is they want to be 
whatever they want to be.

2526
01:54:37,130 --> 01:54:39,140
They want to be a man.
They want to be a woman and they want to

2527
01:54:39,190 --> 01:54:39,720
be,
oh really?

2528
01:54:39,820 --> 01:54:44,820
You want to be?
They want to be they or they want to be 

2529
01:54:44,820 --> 01:54:44,820
it.
They didn't have a year.

2530
01:54:44,820 --> 01:54:49,690
They have different designation.
Fifteen percent queer that they choose 

2531
01:54:49,690 --> 01:54:51,710
10 percent gay,
but 15 percent queer.

2532
01:54:51,710 --> 01:54:52,610
I liked it.
Yeah,

2533
01:54:52,970 --> 01:54:54,710
I like it.
We're moving closer to our goal.

2534
01:54:54,800 --> 01:54:59,800
I feel network and I'm selling queer.
We're moving closer to the goal of 86 

2535
01:55:01,101 --> 01:55:04,250
percent gay by the end of the podcast.
We can do it.

2536
01:55:04,251 --> 01:55:06,530
Ladies and gentlemen.
All we need is more stories.

2537
01:55:06,560 --> 01:55:08,660
We got more brody coming up right after 
this.

2538
01:55:08,690 --> 01:55:11,480
Look at the design of this.
We get this from China,

2539
01:55:11,481 --> 01:55:14,450
but let me assure you,
the quality is remarkable.

2540
01:55:14,510 --> 01:55:17,210
His lips are soft for any cock.
No,

2541
01:55:17,270 --> 01:55:17,660
no,
no,

2542
01:55:17,661 --> 01:55:18,500
no,
no.

2543
01:55:18,590 --> 01:55:20,570
Come on Brian.
Asshole.

2544
01:55:20,571 --> 01:55:22,160
Dude.
You're ruining everything.

2545
01:55:22,580 --> 01:55:25,070
We're so close to getting them up to 25 
percent.

2546
01:55:25,140 --> 01:55:27,530
It's now joe.
No,

2547
01:55:27,531 --> 01:55:28,550
it isn't.
No,

2548
01:55:28,551 --> 01:55:30,980
it isn't.
That's not solid.

2549
01:55:31,280 --> 01:55:32,880
It's not mine,
man.

2550
01:55:32,930 --> 01:55:35,710
Twenty five percent moment.
Task.

2551
01:55:36,050 --> 01:55:41,050
This is what I said at that.
I'm going to be honest with you at that 

2552
01:55:41,050 --> 01:55:41,870
moment.
Okay.

2553
01:55:41,871 --> 01:55:46,871
At the moment where that guy is sucking 
on your Dick happened in person all the 

2554
01:55:47,461 --> 01:55:47,880
time.

2555
01:55:47,880 --> 01:55:50,070
I think you were 40 percent gay.
Are you?

2556
01:55:50,130 --> 01:55:52,330
Are you kidding?
For a moment.

2557
01:55:53,290 --> 01:55:57,390
This could mess with my house.
For that moment when I'm offering you is

2558
01:55:57,391 --> 01:56:00,140
a fluctuating scale of gayness.
You,

2559
01:56:01,160 --> 01:56:03,960
but I.
You brought me all the way up to as high

2560
01:56:03,961 --> 01:56:05,670
as 40.
When you come in a man's mouth,

2561
01:56:05,700 --> 01:56:08,340
he's giving you A.
I think I'm being very generous.

2562
01:56:08,880 --> 01:56:13,880
Very generous by often you were 40 
because for most of the population when 

2563
01:56:13,880 --> 01:56:14,880
you come in and man's mouth,
you hit 100 and you.

2564
01:56:15,720 --> 01:56:17,280
Yes you do.
Yes.

2565
01:56:17,281 --> 01:56:19,140
You did.
You say if you were in prison,

2566
01:56:19,141 --> 01:56:24,141
you got locked in prison.
Brody and I don't plan on going to 

2567
01:56:24,141 --> 01:56:24,141
prison.
Just a nice guy.

2568
01:56:24,141 --> 01:56:25,570
I don't break any laws.
I D,

2569
01:56:25,630 --> 01:56:30,630
I defy you to find me like with prison,
if you will,

2570
01:56:31,990 --> 01:56:36,990
because that's the only place we have no
options is sexual part was I had no 

2571
01:56:36,990 --> 01:56:37,020
options at night.

2572
01:56:37,020 --> 01:56:39,030
Most people don't go to prison.
Brody,

2573
01:56:39,110 --> 01:56:42,170
it's.
It's a dumb thing to bring up for.

2574
01:56:42,510 --> 01:56:47,510
Most people don't go to prison and when 
they walk upstairs on their own without 

2575
01:56:47,510 --> 01:56:49,950
a security guard,
having them shackled risk to anchor you,

2576
01:56:49,960 --> 01:56:54,960
like pretending they had,
they brought me to the mess hall and 

2577
01:56:54,960 --> 01:56:54,960
then they suck my dick.
That's not what happened.

2578
01:56:54,960 --> 01:56:55,260
Okay,
go back.

2579
01:56:55,650 --> 01:57:00,650
Go back to me being blow back to that.
Remember that they didn't blow the 

2580
01:57:00,650 --> 01:57:04,881
Buzzer and give you your one hour 
outside to play basketball and you wind 

2581
01:57:04,881 --> 01:57:05,520
up getting your Dick sucked.
That's not what happened.

2582
01:57:05,521 --> 01:57:07,650
Brody.
You made a choice to go up those stairs.

2583
01:57:07,740 --> 01:57:09,760
There's nothing wrong with it,
but you're to push.

2584
01:57:10,800 --> 01:57:12,620
I don't believe those number.
Ryan,

2585
01:57:12,630 --> 01:57:14,400
what do you think when you come in the 
guy's mouth?

2586
01:57:14,401 --> 01:57:16,740
What are we up to?
I think was just say I did that.

2587
01:57:16,770 --> 01:57:20,220
I'm just assuming he's done.
I would say definitely 25.

2588
01:57:20,250 --> 01:57:21,960
I don't like your numbers,
Brian.

2589
01:57:21,990 --> 01:57:26,990
That's a shocker.
You've never brought that number up to 

2590
01:57:26,990 --> 01:57:30,291
me.
I cannot believe that Joe said 40 

2591
01:57:30,291 --> 01:57:30,291
percent.
Forty percent because I love you.

2592
01:57:30,291 --> 01:57:31,890
I should have said 100 man team and a 
man's mouth.

2593
01:57:31,920 --> 01:57:34,390
Can I say something almost immediately?
Gaze.

2594
01:57:34,410 --> 01:57:37,100
Fuck.
Can I say I wasn't in fucking the guy in

2595
01:57:37,101 --> 01:57:38,640
the DD?
Spit it back into your mouth.

2596
01:57:38,641 --> 01:57:41,610
Brody.
What is more gay?

2597
01:57:41,640 --> 01:57:43,380
What is more?
I'm going to say something to you.

2598
01:57:43,410 --> 01:57:44,040
Hold on a second.

2599
01:57:46,190 --> 01:57:50,280
We'll move on and know what's going.
If you think of 40 percent gay,

2600
01:57:50,780 --> 01:57:55,780
the end of this,
probably think I'm 86 is our goal,

2601
01:57:56,311 --> 01:57:58,860
but you're playing games.
That's not what I said.

2602
01:57:58,861 --> 01:58:00,050
I never said that.
I'll tell you what.

2603
01:58:00,150 --> 01:58:04,260
You have fluctuating scan.
I'm going to get hammered on TV for.

2604
01:58:04,730 --> 01:58:05,460
No,
you're not.

2605
01:58:05,461 --> 01:58:07,210
You're going to be protected me.
Fuck yeah,

2606
01:58:07,740 --> 01:58:09,810
man.
I love you and America loves you.

2607
01:58:09,811 --> 01:58:11,970
Two,
you'll be universally protected.

2608
01:58:12,090 --> 01:58:14,430
The only people that will despise you 
because of this are assholes.

2609
01:58:14,460 --> 01:58:15,570
Fuck down.
What are you?

2610
01:58:15,571 --> 01:58:17,700
Perfect.
You're perfect sexually.

2611
01:58:17,820 --> 01:58:19,560
No.
You keep your room clean.

2612
01:58:19,561 --> 01:58:24,561
Fuck yes I do.
You give brody Stevens a hard time for 

2613
01:58:24,561 --> 01:58:25,230
being an 86 percent gay.
Not Eighty percent.

2614
01:58:26,790 --> 01:58:31,790
Right now we're at 40 stops.
The moment you decide it is the hounds 

2615
01:58:32,340 --> 01:58:34,560
and it's down the hatch of a man's 
throat.

2616
01:58:34,561 --> 01:58:39,480
Probably sacred fucking stubble and I 
don't think that's so bad.

2617
01:58:39,630 --> 01:58:42,010
If you feel stubble on your balls and 
your balls are clean

2618
01:58:42,010 --> 01:58:44,410
shaven,
it probably is a standard guarantee you.

2619
01:58:44,411 --> 01:58:49,411
There's at least 10 comedians that have 
gone down to Brazil and had their penis 

2620
01:58:49,411 --> 01:58:53,251
sucked by a transvestite.
Every time you try to rationalize what 

2621
01:58:53,251 --> 01:58:56,830
you done by comparing yourself to the 
acts of others that are also ridiculous,

2622
01:58:56,950 --> 01:58:58,860
you get another 10 percent gay.
Stop that.

2623
01:58:58,870 --> 01:59:02,800
So we're now at 35 percent gay or goal 
is 86.

2624
01:59:02,801 --> 01:59:05,020
We got at least 20 minutes left this 
podcast.

2625
01:59:05,200 --> 01:59:07,210
We can do this brody.
Well,

2626
01:59:07,211 --> 01:59:09,310
if I talk more,
I would,

2627
01:59:09,430 --> 01:59:12,470
I would probably come very close to 
hitting your goal.

2628
01:59:13,870 --> 01:59:14,980
Oh,
I'm.

2629
01:59:15,400 --> 01:59:18,490
You'd come very close to hitting 86 if 
you tried.

2630
01:59:19,210 --> 01:59:24,210
So look,
if you're on ecstasy and you with a 

2631
01:59:24,210 --> 01:59:26,470
perfectly was on ecstasy like vanity 
vanity from,

2632
01:59:26,471 --> 01:59:27,250
uh,
the man show.

2633
01:59:27,280 --> 01:59:28,070
Remember her?
Yeah,

2634
01:59:28,090 --> 01:59:33,090
she was hot computer.
I've pushed it to the limit and I know 

2635
01:59:33,090 --> 01:59:34,150
what a race car driver roadie.

2636
01:59:34,440 --> 01:59:39,440
Alright,
stop saying like you breaking in new 

2637
01:59:39,440 --> 01:59:41,911
tires.
We're trying to figure out these 

2638
01:59:41,911 --> 01:59:41,911
compounds.
When we hit the skid pad.

2639
01:59:41,911 --> 01:59:46,380
That's not what's going on.
When you say and you push it to the 

2640
01:59:46,380 --> 01:59:46,380
limit,
what are you saying?

2641
01:59:46,380 --> 01:59:46,690
What's with the euphemisms?
Brody,

2642
01:59:46,900 --> 01:59:51,900
let's get real with America because 
America loves you and they love you the 

2643
01:59:51,900 --> 01:59:51,900
most.
You telling the truth?

2644
01:59:51,900 --> 01:59:54,310
I said,
let's see how far I can go.

2645
01:59:54,370 --> 01:59:57,040
That's 35 percent gay,
right?

2646
01:59:58,660 --> 02:00:00,370
I don't think so.
Come on,

2647
02:00:00,371 --> 02:00:01,510
let's be real.
No,

2648
02:00:01,540 --> 02:00:06,540
no.
It might be a 35 percent gay thought 

2649
02:00:06,540 --> 02:00:10,321
worth.
It's worth where we have only four 

2650
02:00:10,321 --> 02:00:13,831
percent.
Where are we at the moment is what's 

2651
02:00:13,831 --> 02:00:13,831
going on here?
She's sucking your Dick,

2652
02:00:13,831 --> 02:00:16,540
but is she tickling your balls?
Like is she probably.

2653
02:00:16,570 --> 02:00:18,880
Does she know her thing?
Does she know what the fuck she's doing?

2654
02:00:18,910 --> 02:00:19,690
Yeah,
they're decent,

2655
02:00:19,691 --> 02:00:22,990
but if you feel like the girls doing it 
or do you feel like a guy's doing it?

2656
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:24,760
That's beautiful.
I don't think about a guy.

2657
02:00:24,940 --> 02:00:27,430
You're not thinking about a guy.
She looks like a girl.

2658
02:00:27,930 --> 02:00:32,030
Make up the hound smell.
Feel harassed sexually.

2659
02:00:32,900 --> 02:00:34,680
Adam know.
I mean.

2660
02:00:34,730 --> 02:00:37,780
Oh,
sorry about that.

2661
02:00:39,280 --> 02:00:42,400
When you release the hounds,
is there any feeling of regret?

2662
02:00:45,400 --> 02:00:50,400
I didn't have any if that.
Even from what my recollection 

2663
02:00:50,400 --> 02:00:50,400
recollection?
No,

2664
02:00:50,400 --> 02:00:51,880
no,
we use stone cold sober.

2665
02:00:53,110 --> 02:00:56,680
I was probably on a hookah and beer.
I think we hit 86 percent.

2666
02:00:56,710 --> 02:00:57,610
No,
we didn't.

2667
02:00:59,580 --> 02:01:04,580
That's I want to say this jail.
I'll talk about whatever you want 

2668
02:01:04,580 --> 02:01:05,590
regarding this.
I'll be honest.

2669
02:01:05,620 --> 02:01:10,620
It is a subject that does make me 
uncomfortable for just a couple reasons.

2670
02:01:11,051 --> 02:01:15,130
The other reasons that it is so public 
and so what I know,

2671
02:01:15,131 --> 02:01:20,131
but it's going to want to make sure that
it's going to be on comedy central and 

2672
02:01:20,131 --> 02:01:20,131
it freaks me out.
No,

2673
02:01:20,131 --> 02:01:20,530
listen,
brody,

2674
02:01:21,040 --> 02:01:26,040
what you.
Who you are is who you are and who you 

2675
02:01:26,040 --> 02:01:26,040
are as awesome.
We love you.

2676
02:01:26,040 --> 02:01:30,420
I ain't no matter if you're 86 percent 
gay or like everybody else in the room 

2677
02:01:30,420 --> 02:01:30,900
right here.
Matter.

2678
02:01:30,940 --> 02:01:35,940
Let me say this.
On this podcast you allowed me to kind 

2679
02:01:35,940 --> 02:01:39,781
of explain everything about express 
yourself and I and I and I feel like 

2680
02:01:39,781 --> 02:01:40,070
maybe on this

2681
02:01:40,070 --> 02:01:42,830
show,
and I'm not blaming anybody,

2682
02:01:42,831 --> 02:01:47,831
it can be my own neurosis.
I don't know if it comes across that 

2683
02:01:47,831 --> 02:01:49,460
way.
Kind of how we explained it.

2684
02:01:49,490 --> 02:01:52,190
I know it's a TV show and I know this is
a podcast,

2685
02:01:52,340 --> 02:01:56,210
but that's where some of my anxiety 
lies,

2686
02:01:56,300 --> 02:02:01,300
but the fact that we just talked about 
this here does make me feel better and 

2687
02:02:01,300 --> 02:02:04,070
knowing that you have my back,
no matter if you're 100 percent gay,

2688
02:02:04,280 --> 02:02:09,280
which not a lot of people not on when 
you come in the guy's mouth you 100 

2689
02:02:09,381 --> 02:02:14,381
percent gay.
A lot of people have said that I don't 

2690
02:02:14,381 --> 02:02:14,381
agree with,
so I don't agree with them.

2691
02:02:14,381 --> 02:02:14,510
I don't agree with them.
Thank you.

2692
02:02:15,080 --> 02:02:16,700
But your third year,
86 percent.

2693
02:02:16,750 --> 02:02:19,370
I'm at that time.
I debate you on that.

2694
02:02:19,400 --> 02:02:21,470
I said 40 before,
but it's because I love you.

2695
02:02:21,471 --> 02:02:23,030
If I didn't know you,
I'd say 100 percent,

2696
02:02:23,031 --> 02:02:25,160
but I do and I love you and I don't 
care.

2697
02:02:25,280 --> 02:02:30,280
I think you're 100 percent awesome.
I don't think it matters if you're a 10 

2698
02:02:30,280 --> 02:02:32,150
percent gay or 25 percent gay.
Who gives a shit and yeah.

2699
02:02:32,151 --> 02:02:35,300
You know what lady boy,
as opposed to a gay man,

2700
02:02:35,420 --> 02:02:40,420
like if,
if it was a dude who looked like don 

2701
02:02:40,420 --> 02:02:40,420
barris and he had a full beard and he 
was sucking your Dick,

2702
02:02:40,420 --> 02:02:44,830
that would be a completely different 
place that God doesn't appreciate.

2703
02:02:45,500 --> 02:02:48,860
God doesn't appreciate it.
I'm joking about God made gay people and

2704
02:02:48,861 --> 02:02:53,861
that's the Christian's conundrum that 
God made gay people to God made 

2705
02:02:53,861 --> 02:02:54,870
everything.
Why did God made sociopath?

2706
02:02:54,871 --> 02:02:58,730
You believe in God?
I don't know.

2707
02:02:59,150 --> 02:03:01,100
This is a reality.
Good question to answer.

2708
02:03:01,370 --> 02:03:06,370
I would like to think that science 
provides me with a lot of answers to the

2709
02:03:07,521 --> 02:03:12,521
what,
how the universe works and I think it 

2710
02:03:12,521 --> 02:03:15,011
does for the most part,
but I think science is discovering new 

2711
02:03:15,011 --> 02:03:15,011
things every day.

2712
02:03:15,011 --> 02:03:16,670
Do I believe religion?
Absolutely not,

2713
02:03:16,880 --> 02:03:21,880
but I do leave open the possibility that
there could be some sort of a higher 

2714
02:03:21,981 --> 02:03:26,981
power.
I don't know if it's a guy with a 

2715
02:03:26,981 --> 02:03:28,430
fucking robe who lives in the clouds and
has a harp.

2716
02:03:28,431 --> 02:03:33,431
I don't know,
but the reason why I don't know is 

2717
02:03:33,431 --> 02:03:33,431
because I haven't died.
I haven't been there.

2718
02:03:33,431 --> 02:03:38,171
I don't know.
Life itself is way crazier than a god 

2719
02:03:38,171 --> 02:03:41,420
just life itself safe.
There's no god that made the universe.

2720
02:03:41,510 --> 02:03:43,970
There's no universal power that controls
this.

2721
02:03:43,971 --> 02:03:48,971
There's no laws that God the universe to
have an ever expanding degree of 

2722
02:03:48,971 --> 02:03:50,360
complexity.
If there's none of that,

2723
02:03:50,361 --> 02:03:53,900
if there's no higher power.
Man,

2724
02:03:53,901 --> 02:03:58,901
this is amazing.
It's amazing if there's no one running 

2725
02:03:58,901 --> 02:03:59,570
the show,
it's amazing that this happened.

2726
02:03:59,571 --> 02:04:01,520
It's amazing.
There was a big bang.

2727
02:04:01,700 --> 02:04:06,700
There was something smaller than the 
head of a pin and by some sort of 

2728
02:04:06,700 --> 02:04:07,430
reaction that no one can explain.

2729
02:04:07,430 --> 02:04:12,430
It exploded and this incredibly dense,
tiny object became everything you see in

2730
02:04:13,311 --> 02:04:16,010
the universe,
every particle of matter,

2731
02:04:16,011 --> 02:04:19,190
even the ones we can't even figure out,
like dark matter.

2732
02:04:19,310 --> 02:04:24,260
All that shit is so fascinating.
The fact that every fucking galaxy has a

2733
02:04:24,261 --> 02:04:29,261
supermassive black hole inside of it.
That's one half of one percent of the 

2734
02:04:29,261 --> 02:04:30,770
mass of the entire galaxy.
The bigger the black hole,

2735
02:04:30,780 --> 02:04:33,170
the bigger the gap.
It's fucking madness.

2736
02:04:33,260 --> 02:04:36,740
And then the fact that inside every 
black hole might be another universe,

2737
02:04:36,840 --> 02:04:41,840
supernovas and asteroids and lava and 
Komodo dragons and pigeons.

2738
02:04:42,840 --> 02:04:45,720
The world is fucking crazy.
It's a mad,

2739
02:04:45,721 --> 02:04:47,340
mad,
mad world,

2740
02:04:47,550 --> 02:04:52,550
and to think that it's impossible for 
there to be a god I think is ridiculous.

2741
02:04:52,831 --> 02:04:56,460
The whole thing's impossible.
A lava is impossible.

2742
02:04:56,610 --> 02:04:59,470
Oceans are impossible.
A rivers impossible.

2743
02:04:59,520 --> 02:05:02,120
Salmon are and possible a fucking 
grizzly bears,

2744
02:05:02,130 --> 02:05:04,560
madness.
All of its craziness.

2745
02:05:04,650 --> 02:05:07,560
Every single fucking thing on earth is 
insane.

2746
02:05:07,800 --> 02:05:10,770
All of it together is the fact that it 
exists.

2747
02:05:10,771 --> 02:05:15,420
The fact that we're on a podcast and we 
could broadcast instantly worldwide.

2748
02:05:15,421 --> 02:05:18,810
The fact that we have laptops that are 
fucking inch thin and contained,

2749
02:05:18,820 --> 02:05:21,690
two gigabytes of data.
The fact that you could buy beer,

2750
02:05:21,691 --> 02:05:25,680
you don't have to fucking go get a wood 
barrel together like an asshole,

2751
02:05:25,681 --> 02:05:28,440
like one of those moonshiners shitheads 
and brew your own booze.

2752
02:05:28,710 --> 02:05:31,050
It's all madness.
Brody Stevens,

2753
02:05:31,110 --> 02:05:33,630
so I don't know if there's a god,
but I'll tell you what,

2754
02:05:33,631 --> 02:05:38,631
that comforts me.
The fact that you're not one of those 

2755
02:05:38,631 --> 02:05:38,631
guys should go,
no,

2756
02:05:38,631 --> 02:05:42,711
there's no god.
Those guys haven't taken the test or 

2757
02:05:42,711 --> 02:05:42,711
whatever.
I believe.

2758
02:05:42,711 --> 02:05:43,800
I'm like you.
I believe there's an higher.

2759
02:05:43,920 --> 02:05:46,470
There's a higher bain.
That's all.

2760
02:05:46,471 --> 02:05:49,260
I'm into prayer,
I believe and blast.

2761
02:05:49,320 --> 02:05:53,430
I'm not into the whole religion.
I like to think of more spiritual,

2762
02:05:53,580 --> 02:05:56,040
but basically like a chick.
You're selling a chicken.

2763
02:05:56,041 --> 02:05:57,620
My Yoga class.
How long?

2764
02:05:58,020 --> 02:06:00,400
What does that make me?
Ninety percent gay legend,

2765
02:06:00,401 --> 02:06:02,220
but I'm pretty spiritual.
Well,

2766
02:06:02,221 --> 02:06:04,260
I am.
I am.

2767
02:06:05,340 --> 02:06:05,900
I,
I,

2768
02:06:06,180 --> 02:06:09,280
I'm not afraid to say it.
Sometimes I feel in Hollywood it,

2769
02:06:09,290 --> 02:06:12,030
if it's wrong to say you believe in God.

2770
02:06:12,420 --> 02:06:13,350
Well I,
you know,

2771
02:06:13,380 --> 02:06:15,900
I think it's wrong to.
I don't want to say wrong,

2772
02:06:16,050 --> 02:06:18,900
but I don't think it's a good idea.
For me personally.

2773
02:06:18,901 --> 02:06:23,901
I'll say this,
I'll try to be as a broadminded about 

2774
02:06:23,901 --> 02:06:28,191
this as possible.
It's not a good idea for me personally 

2775
02:06:28,191 --> 02:06:30,480
to believe in anything that I can't 
rationally explain and see the work.

2776
02:06:30,780 --> 02:06:33,270
Like when I don't understand quantum 
physics.

2777
02:06:33,390 --> 02:06:34,590
Okay.
And I've tried.

2778
02:06:34,591 --> 02:06:37,890
I've read a few books on it.
I've watched many documentaries on it.

2779
02:06:37,891 --> 02:06:40,230
I've had quantum physicists on the 
podcast.

2780
02:06:40,231 --> 02:06:43,140
We had a [inaudible] Swami who's a 
quantum theorists.

2781
02:06:43,141 --> 02:06:46,860
We had him on the podcast.
He talked his mystical wizardry to us.

2782
02:06:47,310 --> 02:06:49,410
I don't necessarily understand it 
though,

2783
02:06:50,070 --> 02:06:52,500
and so when people say,
do you believe in quantum physics?

2784
02:06:52,980 --> 02:06:55,090
I got to go.
I think they.

2785
02:06:55,230 --> 02:07:00,230
They know,
they know what they're saying and 

2786
02:07:00,230 --> 02:07:00,270
universally amongst them they agree.

2787
02:07:00,480 --> 02:07:03,480
Uncertain principles amongst all these 
quantum physicists,

2788
02:07:04,080 --> 02:07:05,520
but me personally,
I don't.

2789
02:07:05,640 --> 02:07:10,260
I honestly don't know enough to say,
I know what the fuck is going on.

2790
02:07:10,350 --> 02:07:13,910
I trust them for sure that they're 
telling the truth.

2791
02:07:14,010 --> 02:07:17,220
It's not just a whole group of liars 
whose making Shit Up.

2792
02:07:17,221 --> 02:07:19,830
I don't think that's going on,
but when I say,

2793
02:07:20,070 --> 02:07:22,370
when you say like,
do you believe I grew up?

2794
02:07:22,650 --> 02:07:24,690
I guess I guess,
but I don't know.

2795
02:07:25,080 --> 02:07:30,080
That's the same way I feel about 
religion is the same way I feel about 

2796
02:07:30,080 --> 02:07:30,080
the idea of God.
Like,

2797
02:07:30,080 --> 02:07:30,170
do you believe in God?
I don't.

2798
02:07:30,171 --> 02:07:30,990
Dunno.
I Dunno.

2799
02:07:31,110 --> 02:07:34,980
I don't know.
And less so that then quantum physics so

2800
02:07:35,050 --> 02:07:40,050
don't know,
but you are assuming that you seem to 

2801
02:07:40,050 --> 02:07:41,140
say no to religion,
but it's created by man.

2802
02:07:41,170 --> 02:07:43,630
There's make no mistake about it.
It's approvable.

2803
02:07:43,750 --> 02:07:45,550
We can show the lineage of religion.

2804
02:07:45,560 --> 02:07:50,560
We can show the new testament being 
created by Constantine and all these 

2805
02:07:50,560 --> 02:07:51,940
bishops.
It's been proven that there were certain

2806
02:07:52,240 --> 02:07:56,950
pieces of work but of religious work 
that was left out of that.

2807
02:07:56,951 --> 02:07:59,620
They've made decisions as to what to put
in the Bible,

2808
02:07:59,830 --> 02:08:04,830
what to leave out of the Bible.
It's been shown that there's been a 

2809
02:08:04,830 --> 02:08:06,580
metamorphosis of the Christian religion 
from the jump.

2810
02:08:06,910 --> 02:08:11,910
There's a difference between the 
original ancient Hebrew Bible and the 

2811
02:08:12,190 --> 02:08:13,900
Dead Sea Scrolls,
which is the oldest version of the Bible

2812
02:08:13,901 --> 02:08:18,901
by like a thousand years,
and I think the only one that was 

2813
02:08:18,901 --> 02:08:21,190
written in Aramaic.
So you've got the ancient Hebrew version

2814
02:08:21,191 --> 02:08:24,100
of the Bible.
You've got the translations from ancient

2815
02:08:24,101 --> 02:08:27,670
Hebrew to Latin and Greek into.
You know,

2816
02:08:27,671 --> 02:08:30,160
there's so many different things going 
on.

2817
02:08:30,400 --> 02:08:33,910
There's so many different things going 
on when you talk about like religion,

2818
02:08:34,260 --> 02:08:36,490
what you're talking about is what man 
wrote down.

2819
02:08:36,580 --> 02:08:38,590
Yeah.
That doesn't necessarily mean there's no

2820
02:08:38,591 --> 02:08:43,591
god and I don't think you can ever.
I think the universe is so vast and 

2821
02:08:43,961 --> 02:08:46,960
puzzling that to really decide that you 
know,

2822
02:08:46,961 --> 02:08:51,670
how it all started and you know,
how what's going on behind the scenes.

2823
02:08:52,090 --> 02:08:53,980
You have to be a fool.
I don't know.

2824
02:08:53,981 --> 02:08:58,360
I don't think our idea of a god is like 
a person with superpowers.

2825
02:08:58,640 --> 02:09:03,640
I think that's pretty ridiculous,
but I don't think it's impossible that 

2826
02:09:03,640 --> 02:09:06,310
there might be some godlike quality 
that's running the show.

2827
02:09:06,700 --> 02:09:10,120
There seems to be some fucking pretty 
clear laws to this place.

2828
02:09:10,450 --> 02:09:15,450
There also seems to be some weird codes 
that you find in things like the 

2829
02:09:15,450 --> 02:09:19,711
FIBONACCI sequence is that the fibonacci
sequences of mathematical sequence that 

2830
02:09:19,811 --> 02:09:23,740
you find in sunflowers and pine cones 
and the shape of a person's face.

2831
02:09:24,040 --> 02:09:27,760
And the FIBONACCI sequence is also a,
it was used in a tool song.

2832
02:09:28,370 --> 02:09:31,360
Um,
I don't remember the fucking song.

2833
02:09:31,690 --> 02:09:33,900
Let me,
let me pull it up because it's amazing.

2834
02:09:34,560 --> 02:09:39,560
Um,
maynard maynard is just a bad 

2835
02:09:39,560 --> 02:09:43,240
motherfucker.
He's just such an interesting creative.

2836
02:09:43,270 --> 02:09:45,640
Have you met him or Adam of the podcast?
Yeah,

2837
02:09:45,641 --> 02:09:46,510
yeah.
A couple of times.

2838
02:09:46,750 --> 02:09:47,320
It's,
oh,

2839
02:09:47,321 --> 02:09:49,900
that's it.
It's lateralis a l,

2840
02:09:49,901 --> 02:09:52,840
a t,
e r a l u s,

2841
02:09:53,020 --> 02:09:57,400
but he used the FIBONACCI sequence to to
like to make this song.

2842
02:09:58,780 --> 02:10:03,780
The FIBONACCI sequence is it's like zero
and then one and then two and then three

2843
02:10:06,521 --> 02:10:11,521
and then two plus three is five and then
five plus three is eight and it's this 

2844
02:10:11,521 --> 02:10:15,211
exponentially expanding series of 
numbers and the idea is that this,

2845
02:10:16,480 --> 02:10:17,740
this coding,
this,

2846
02:10:18,070 --> 02:10:18,940
these,
these,

2847
02:10:19,710 --> 02:10:23,830
the golden section of the golden string 
as it were as it's described,

2848
02:10:24,220 --> 02:10:29,220
is like the secret to life itself.
That life itself is this weird fractal 

2849
02:10:29,681 --> 02:10:34,681
mathematical proposition and that you 
see it in all these different things 

2850
02:10:34,681 --> 02:10:38,561
like the nautilus shells and all these 
different various fruits and vegetables 

2851
02:10:38,561 --> 02:10:42,401
that have these bizarre shapes to them 
and then this is all the fibonacci 

2852
02:10:42,401 --> 02:10:42,401
sequences,
all the.

2853
02:10:42,401 --> 02:10:47,140
The actual underlying code of life 
itself and that the fact that these 

2854
02:10:47,140 --> 02:10:52,031
items are not random.
The fact that these things like 

2855
02:10:52,031 --> 02:10:54,940
sunflower seeds are all governed by this
mathematical program almost shows that 

2856
02:10:55,311 --> 02:10:58,700
there's something going on behind the 
scenes that we can't quite describe.

2857
02:10:59,090 --> 02:11:04,090
And in fact there was a.
A quantum physicist that came up with 

2858
02:11:04,090 --> 02:11:06,830
this theory,
that life itself,

2859
02:11:06,831 --> 02:11:08,060
that in the,
in the,

2860
02:11:08,100 --> 02:11:13,100
the lowest measurable levels of,
of the universe itself in the theories,

2861
02:11:13,500 --> 02:11:15,170
these quantum theories that these guys 
are creating,

2862
02:11:15,320 --> 02:11:18,110
they're finding self-correcting computer
code,

2863
02:11:18,410 --> 02:11:23,410
a very specific type of computer code 
that was created in the 19 thirties by 

2864
02:11:23,410 --> 02:11:27,311
human beings and people are looking at 
it as the possibility by seeing all this

2865
02:11:29,541 --> 02:11:34,541
stuff,
the possibility that reality itself is 

2866
02:11:34,541 --> 02:11:35,780
an artificial creation that we're living
in

2867
02:11:36,100 --> 02:11:39,490
and I've heard that it seems like it 
might be possible.

2868
02:11:39,700 --> 02:11:44,700
It's going to happen that this is just a
dream or this is a figment of 

2869
02:11:47,651 --> 02:11:49,660
simulation.
So yeah,

2870
02:11:49,670 --> 02:11:50,860
there is no reality.

2871
02:11:51,360 --> 02:11:56,360
You know,
and this was discussed in the concepts 

2872
02:11:56,360 --> 02:11:57,720
like people have tried to figure out 
what is reality.

2873
02:11:57,721 --> 02:11:57,760
Yeah.

2874
02:11:57,940 --> 02:12:00,290
What does that mean?
The one thing that freaks me out,

2875
02:12:00,291 --> 02:12:03,860
I mean this is just basic for me,
it's just like looking up into the stars

2876
02:12:03,861 --> 02:12:06,140
in the sky and go.
It goes on forever.

2877
02:12:06,170 --> 02:12:11,170
Where does it stop?
Do you ever stop and think how many 

2878
02:12:11,170 --> 02:12:11,170
dicks are out there?
You know what?

2879
02:12:11,170 --> 02:12:13,370
I wasn't not,
I'm not into that.

2880
02:12:13,430 --> 02:12:16,160
How long did you last when the guy was 
sucking you off?

2881
02:12:16,250 --> 02:12:17,540
Yeah,
that's an important point.

2882
02:12:19,370 --> 02:12:22,620
Sending less than six days.
Probably.

2883
02:12:22,650 --> 02:12:25,100
Good.
It was a you up at 100 percent.

2884
02:12:25,480 --> 02:12:28,220
Good at 89 minutes now.
80 six is what it is.

2885
02:12:28,320 --> 02:12:31,290
Hey,
why don't you last though this ADC.

2886
02:12:31,370 --> 02:12:36,370
How long did you last?
You're going to set me up for another 

2887
02:12:36,370 --> 02:12:37,880
percentage point.
I don't keep track of that.

2888
02:12:37,970 --> 02:12:41,390
I don't last long anyway.
So you were a bit intoxicated.

2889
02:12:41,450 --> 02:12:44,360
You were drunk.
I was drunk off diet coke.

2890
02:12:44,410 --> 02:12:49,410
Oh,
you said you had a couple of beers or 

2891
02:12:49,410 --> 02:12:49,410
they.
I don't think they serve beers.

2892
02:12:49,410 --> 02:12:49,410
And these,
these top ones.

2893
02:12:49,410 --> 02:12:51,110
You gotta make your fucking stories.
Straight power.

2894
02:12:51,250 --> 02:12:52,580
What do you want me to say?
I'm drunk.

2895
02:12:52,620 --> 02:12:54,730
You were saying you were drinking beer?
I might've had a beer.

2896
02:12:54,740 --> 02:12:57,210
Two downstairs.
How many beers too?

2897
02:12:58,250 --> 02:12:59,930
I wasn't hammered.
Is that what you're asking?

2898
02:12:59,950 --> 02:13:01,000
I wasn't hammer.
No.

2899
02:13:01,010 --> 02:13:04,050
I'm just wondering whether when I'm 
drunk I can't come.

2900
02:13:04,070 --> 02:13:05,720
It takes forever.
Dick doesn't get hard.

2901
02:13:05,721 --> 02:13:07,490
It doesn't work.
If you got so excited,

2902
02:13:07,491 --> 02:13:10,130
even though you were drunk,
might have to kick you up.

2903
02:13:10,140 --> 02:13:15,140
The 92 percent guy I.
I made a choice.

2904
02:13:15,441 --> 02:13:20,441
I followed it and I was pleased with 
what I did.

2905
02:13:21,380 --> 02:13:25,660
What were you pleased the boat,
the amount of ejaculate with?

2906
02:13:25,661 --> 02:13:26,960
Do I have to?
Am I going to have.

2907
02:13:27,100 --> 02:13:28,190
That's what I'm saying.
Like.

2908
02:13:28,220 --> 02:13:29,980
Well,
you said you were pleased by the result.

2909
02:13:30,560 --> 02:13:32,310
When I a lot,
I like to look at it.

2910
02:13:33,110 --> 02:13:35,220
If I have like a big fucking load that 
comes out of me,

2911
02:13:35,221 --> 02:13:40,221
I'm impressing myself.
Did he look like a squirrel with an 

2912
02:13:40,221 --> 02:13:40,221
acorn after he was done with you?
Well,

2913
02:13:40,221 --> 02:13:40,920
first of all,
I get impressed when I see my boogers.

2914
02:13:41,200 --> 02:13:44,520
If I blow my nose and it's a big fucking
water snot and a tissue,

2915
02:13:44,550 --> 02:13:47,250
I get excited because you're cleaning 
stuff out.

2916
02:13:47,251 --> 02:13:49,350
I liked when I pick it too.
Even though you're not supposed to.

2917
02:13:49,470 --> 02:13:51,030
Why are you not supposed to pick your 
nose?

2918
02:13:51,090 --> 02:13:53,510
Because it's bad for your nose.
You turbinates and flame.

2919
02:13:53,540 --> 02:13:58,540
It can cause sleep apnea.
If you just do that because deviated 

2920
02:13:58,540 --> 02:14:01,350
Septum by picking your nose.
Your nose is very sensitive.

2921
02:14:01,351 --> 02:14:02,610
It's you're not supposed to be digging 
in there.

2922
02:14:02,670 --> 02:14:03,450
I pull hair.

2923
02:14:03,450 --> 02:14:05,880
Sometimes they get ingrown hairs and 
they grow back.

2924
02:14:05,881 --> 02:14:07,770
Or then if you could have nose trimmer,
you fuck.

2925
02:14:07,800 --> 02:14:09,000
That's the way to go.
Science.

2926
02:14:09,001 --> 02:14:11,240
They figured it out.
Neil degrasse Tyson invented it.

2927
02:14:11,520 --> 02:14:13,080
Who is he?
Exactly?

2928
02:14:13,170 --> 02:14:15,000
How dare you.
They had to come out his nose.

2929
02:14:15,690 --> 02:14:16,710
Yeah.
How much I,

2930
02:14:16,740 --> 02:14:18,000
I,
there's a condom.

2931
02:14:18,060 --> 02:14:19,860
Thank you.
Good move.

2932
02:14:19,890 --> 02:14:22,860
Otherwise you get the super aids.
They probably,

2933
02:14:23,160 --> 02:14:23,750
you know,
I didn't.

2934
02:14:23,751 --> 02:14:25,620
I just don't want to get reckon I don't 
wreck it.

2935
02:14:25,621 --> 02:14:30,621
I don't want to get.
We'll take the Tarzana hat off and 

2936
02:14:30,621 --> 02:14:30,621
you're all set.
I don't.

2937
02:14:30,621 --> 02:14:31,680
I don't want to be rid of.
It can be your move.

2938
02:14:31,681 --> 02:14:36,681
Like Larry the cable guy.
If he doesn't have that fucking shirt 

2939
02:14:36,681 --> 02:14:36,681
on,
no one's going to know who he is.

2940
02:14:36,681 --> 02:14:40,010
That's a very clever move on his hat.
Wear a baseball hat and wear a shirt 

2941
02:14:40,010 --> 02:14:40,290
that way when he's not.

2942
02:14:40,290 --> 02:14:41,740
When he wants to dress up and go to a 
restaurant.

2943
02:14:41,750 --> 02:14:46,750
Already know what he looks like.
A regular fucking redneck slides right 

2944
02:14:46,750 --> 02:14:47,460
into the door.
She'll go on.

2945
02:14:47,461 --> 02:14:51,660
How much did you come just happened?
If it says,

2946
02:14:51,661 --> 02:14:53,640
if it sounds wrong,
the way I'm asking you,

2947
02:14:53,700 --> 02:14:54,600
you know,
correct me.

2948
02:14:55,020 --> 02:14:57,090
I'm new to this game.
It's,

2949
02:14:57,620 --> 02:14:58,910
it was uh,
it was it.

2950
02:14:58,950 --> 02:15:01,940
I did it and that was it.
I,

2951
02:15:02,060 --> 02:15:07,060
I pushed it and it was a good.
I wouldn't say it was good.

2952
02:15:08,971 --> 02:15:09,900
It was like,
well,

2953
02:15:10,110 --> 02:15:12,110
I did it.
Hmm.

2954
02:15:12,420 --> 02:15:17,420
That's like,
is that like eating and Kentucky Fried 

2955
02:15:17,420 --> 02:15:20,300
Chicken or is taking a really good shit?
I had more lean towards Kentucky Fried 

2956
02:15:21,030 --> 02:15:22,030
Chicken,
Kentucky Fried Chicken.

2957
02:15:22,031 --> 02:15:23,760
It's pretty fucking good.
It's good stuff.

2958
02:15:23,870 --> 02:15:24,840
You know,
I went gluten free,

2959
02:15:24,841 --> 02:15:27,000
but that's one thing I miss mom.
I Miss Kentucky.

2960
02:15:27,030 --> 02:15:27,510
Okay,
now,

2961
02:15:28,430 --> 02:15:28,940
I mean,
you,

2962
02:15:29,070 --> 02:15:30,540
you've had me say a lot of stuff.

2963
02:15:30,540 --> 02:15:35,540
Joe Are my.
Am I going to get negative tweets based 

2964
02:15:35,540 --> 02:15:36,150
on listen man,
if you do those people are assholes.

2965
02:15:36,180 --> 02:15:38,130
You didn't do anything wrong.
You didn't hurt anybody.

2966
02:15:38,580 --> 02:15:41,070
You want to have fun.
You went to have fun.

2967
02:15:41,080 --> 02:15:43,140
He did it with someone who wanted to 
have fun with you.

2968
02:15:43,320 --> 02:15:45,360
Who gives a shit?
Who gives a shit?

2969
02:15:45,400 --> 02:15:46,830
Yeah,
man,

2970
02:15:47,020 --> 02:15:48,870
it's on them.
It's on all of them,

2971
02:15:48,871 --> 02:15:49,730
man.
Who Cares?

2972
02:15:49,760 --> 02:15:53,850
We'll wait to check.
Tweet glutton for punishment.

2973
02:15:54,510 --> 02:15:55,860
You love it.
You're hoping they're metal.

2974
02:15:55,920 --> 02:16:00,920
I don't enjoy it.
I don't want to elevate homophobes 

2975
02:16:00,920 --> 02:16:02,750
sample.
I usually say antisemites.

2976
02:16:02,880 --> 02:16:04,590
How much do you use the a?
You should say that.

2977
02:16:04,591 --> 02:16:06,540
If they say the key things,
if it's a Jew,

2978
02:16:06,541 --> 02:16:08,370
things calm homophobes oh,
switch.

2979
02:16:08,400 --> 02:16:09,930
Confused the fuck out of him.
Dude.

2980
02:16:10,260 --> 02:16:12,060
I don't want to.
I don't want to waste to hate on it.

2981
02:16:12,061 --> 02:16:13,400
I just want to be honest.

2982
02:16:14,140 --> 02:16:16,620
No,
I don't want to hate camel.

2983
02:16:16,800 --> 02:16:17,270
No,
I just,

2984
02:16:18,960 --> 02:16:23,960
I'm sure I'm going to have to deal with 
some negative stuff here and there on 

2985
02:16:23,960 --> 02:16:23,960
twitter or whatever or you get no matter
what.

2986
02:16:23,960 --> 02:16:25,470
All right,
well maybe a couple emails,

2987
02:16:25,471 --> 02:16:26,370
but.
So what?

2988
02:16:26,400 --> 02:16:27,810
I'm positive.
I feel good.

2989
02:16:27,840 --> 02:16:29,320
You're awesome.
HIV positive?

2990
02:16:29,380 --> 02:16:30,540
No.
Brian.

2991
02:16:30,550 --> 02:16:33,130
Fuck you man.
Speaking of which Dallas buyers club,

2992
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:39,000
I don't want to just that movie bring it
up because it has a lot of your people 

2993
02:16:39,000 --> 02:16:39,000
in it,
but it's a great fucking movie.

2994
02:16:39,000 --> 02:16:41,610
Might people,
Texans.

2995
02:16:41,650 --> 02:16:43,480
Aren't you from Texas?
I've been to Texas.

2996
02:16:43,481 --> 02:16:47,350
What do you mean my people I know you 
sell well in Texas.

2997
02:16:48,460 --> 02:16:50,680
Dallas buyers club is a matthew 
mcconaughey.

2998
02:16:50,681 --> 02:16:55,681
He's not gay.
Nobody lost a lot of white female 

2999
02:16:55,681 --> 02:16:55,681
fucking bull rider.
Okay.

3000
02:16:55,681 --> 02:16:56,480
He says Manley's a gets.
Okay.

3001
02:16:56,560 --> 02:16:59,920
And um,
he got HIV through unprotected sex.

3002
02:16:59,980 --> 02:17:04,980
Shame on him.
The first guy in the history of the 

3003
02:17:04,980 --> 02:17:04,980
world.
In fact,

3004
02:17:04,980 --> 02:17:07,950
are you serious?
And he was the only guy I ever heard 

3005
02:17:07,950 --> 02:17:08,170
that Sam Kinison joke about it.
They'll believe it.

3006
02:17:08,400 --> 02:17:10,240
They say sam,
they say AC,

3007
02:17:10,290 --> 02:17:15,290
heterosexual disease.
Straight people dive into want fucking 

3008
02:17:15,960 --> 02:17:16,590
guy

3009
02:17:16,880 --> 02:17:17,420
pull,
pull.

3010
02:17:17,470 --> 02:17:20,590
Pull up that.
That's a class kinison.

3011
02:17:20,640 --> 02:17:24,700
It's a fucking classic.
He was the greatest Sam kinison on,

3012
02:17:24,730 --> 02:17:26,020
uh,
on AIDS.

3013
02:17:26,200 --> 02:17:29,420
On heterosexuals.
Yeah,

3014
02:17:29,560 --> 02:17:32,040
sure.
Dice had some crazy bits to back.

3015
02:17:32,790 --> 02:17:36,070
No kennison more.
Sorry.

3016
02:17:36,160 --> 02:17:41,160
Kinison was the kindness center.
He was a groundbreaker and I'm a dice 

3017
02:17:41,160 --> 02:17:41,160
fan,
but Kennedy was the groundbreaking,

3018
02:17:41,510 --> 02:17:43,220
you know,
Kensington became kinison.

3019
02:17:43,270 --> 02:17:46,330
His book is fascinating.
My brother Sam is a book.

3020
02:17:46,350 --> 02:17:51,350
Has his brother wrote about being Sam's 
brother and it's like no holds barred 

3021
02:17:51,350 --> 02:17:53,380
behind the scenes.
Everything did come out a few years ago,

3022
02:17:53,440 --> 02:17:55,470
many years ago.
I think I read it in the nine to get it.

3023
02:17:55,480 --> 02:17:56,560
You get it.
But uh,

3024
02:17:56,620 --> 02:17:58,060
he got,
he got hit by a car.

3025
02:17:58,090 --> 02:18:00,010
He did,
yeah.

3026
02:18:00,011 --> 02:18:03,640
He was a young boy and he got hit by a 
car and it changed him.

3027
02:18:03,820 --> 02:18:05,140
When you get hit by a car,
all of a sudden,

3028
02:18:05,350 --> 02:18:07,960
different guy,
as soon as he recovers from it,

3029
02:18:07,961 --> 02:18:09,160
they say that happens,
man.

3030
02:18:09,160 --> 02:18:10,450
I've heard that.
I read about like,

3031
02:18:10,451 --> 02:18:14,830
people wake up and they're different and
they actually know how to play the piano

3032
02:18:14,831 --> 02:18:18,290
or there was one recently about that.
This guy,

3033
02:18:18,760 --> 02:18:19,360
he,
uh,

3034
02:18:19,390 --> 02:18:22,330
got a severe concussion and then they 
saw playing music.

3035
02:18:23,580 --> 02:18:28,580
He started a.
He had all this fucking musical talent 

3036
02:18:28,580 --> 02:18:28,660
that he never had before.
And yeah,

3037
02:18:28,670 --> 02:18:32,530
teenager credits,
musical talent to head injury was crazy.

3038
02:18:32,820 --> 02:18:34,660
In fact,
this happened to a friend of mine.

3039
02:18:34,900 --> 02:18:38,440
Her son was never artistic at all and he
got a motorcycle accident.

3040
02:18:38,441 --> 02:18:40,150
He crashed.
He hurt himself pretty bad.

3041
02:18:40,151 --> 02:18:45,151
He's pretty fucked up.
And he had some serious brain injuries 

3042
02:18:45,151 --> 02:18:45,151
because of it means fine when you talk 
to them,

3043
02:18:45,151 --> 02:18:47,200
you would never imagined talked to them.
Seems totally.

3044
02:18:47,201 --> 02:18:48,670
No.
But because of that,

3045
02:18:48,671 --> 02:18:52,120
he's like super artistic now and he'd 
never had that before.

3046
02:18:52,390 --> 02:18:54,880
I'm not saying you should fucking put 
your kid in the head.

3047
02:18:55,290 --> 02:18:56,770
They can't draw pictures.
Good.

3048
02:18:57,310 --> 02:19:02,310
But there's something that happens 
sometimes to people when they get head 

3049
02:19:02,310 --> 02:19:05,941
injuries and with Kennison,
his brother said he just became 

3050
02:19:05,941 --> 02:19:05,941
fearless.
Oh Wow.

3051
02:19:05,941 --> 02:19:08,200
He's gotta read.
I gotta read up on that crate book.

3052
02:19:08,201 --> 02:19:09,010
Dude.
It's a great.

3053
02:19:09,070 --> 02:19:11,140
Could you imagine if he was still 
performing today?

3054
02:19:11,141 --> 02:19:13,900
Like where would you see Kennison if he 
was still performing today?

3055
02:19:13,901 --> 02:19:18,901
Like what would he be at where you know,
what level do you think it will depend 

3056
02:19:20,711 --> 02:19:23,440
entirely on whether or not he was clean 
and sober.

3057
02:19:23,550 --> 02:19:28,550
Okay.
And it wouldn't even have to be clean 

3058
02:19:28,550 --> 02:19:28,550
and sober,
but you would have to straighten

3059
02:19:28,550 --> 02:19:29,720
his act out enough to get his health 
together.

3060
02:19:30,050 --> 02:19:34,100
Because what happened with Kennison is 
if you go back to kinisons first CD,

3061
02:19:34,580 --> 02:19:36,740
which is louder than hell.
It wasn't even an accident.

3062
02:19:36,741 --> 02:19:41,741
That CD was on cassette and it's really 
hard to get louder than hell is in my 

3063
02:19:42,411 --> 02:19:47,411
opinion.
It's like the all time greatest comedy 

3064
02:19:47,411 --> 02:19:47,411
album ever.
The groundbreaking,

3065
02:19:47,411 --> 02:19:48,350
there had been nobody like Kennison 
before,

3066
02:19:48,950 --> 02:19:51,980
but when you go from there to have you 
seen me lately,

3067
02:19:52,280 --> 02:19:53,990
pool,
there's a big drop off,

3068
02:19:54,500 --> 02:19:55,640
drop off,
drop off,

3069
02:19:55,641 --> 02:19:58,430
and then from there to the other ones,
wow.

3070
02:19:58,431 --> 02:20:01,250
It gets worse and worse.
The further the distance you go,

3071
02:20:01,520 --> 02:20:03,980
because he couldn't keep it up.
Man,

3072
02:20:04,010 --> 02:20:09,010
there's no way you can keep up cocaine 
every night and she fucking vodka and 

3073
02:20:09,010 --> 02:20:12,350
Jack Daniels and he's 350 pounds.
He's five feet tall,

3074
02:20:12,570 --> 02:20:16,340
is unhealthy.
Everything's wrong.

3075
02:20:16,400 --> 02:20:20,570
Addiction in every form.
Sexual cocaine,

3076
02:20:20,571 --> 02:20:22,220
alcohol,
blackouts.

3077
02:20:22,640 --> 02:20:26,720
He was going hard man,
and he used to talk about it too.

3078
02:20:26,721 --> 02:20:28,970
He's talk about how he would get.
He had bits about it.

3079
02:20:29,180 --> 02:20:30,920
How do you get to a party?
And they'd go,

3080
02:20:30,921 --> 02:20:31,270
well,
isn't it?

3081
02:20:31,290 --> 02:20:32,010
It's you.
It's easy.

3082
02:20:32,011 --> 02:20:33,950
If you guys do coke,
he'd go to a part of it.

3083
02:20:33,960 --> 02:20:36,320
Let's put a little line out for they see
me and they go,

3084
02:20:36,430 --> 02:20:40,760
oh,
and they fucking spreadable.

3085
02:20:40,850 --> 02:20:45,850
And he talked about doing this gigantic 
line of coke and almost having a heart 

3086
02:20:45,850 --> 02:20:49,121
attack.
Did jokes about the fact that people 

3087
02:20:49,121 --> 02:20:52,391
expected him to be this mad party animal
and the doesn't have the act itself took

3088
02:20:54,591 --> 02:20:57,340
a back seat to the lifestyle,
the act,

3089
02:20:57,620 --> 02:20:59,750
the act itself took a backseat to the 
chaos.

3090
02:20:59,950 --> 02:21:04,950
Like a lot of comics go.
They fluctuate like you'll like one 

3091
02:21:04,950 --> 02:21:08,300
special better and then the next one 
maybe you won't like it all and then the

3092
02:21:08,301 --> 02:21:09,290
next one will be even better.

3093
02:21:09,440 --> 02:21:14,440
You know,
there's guys that I really love but I 

3094
02:21:14,440 --> 02:21:16,961
only love like even prior there's some 
of his is ones that I don't enjoy as 

3095
02:21:16,961 --> 02:21:18,210
much as other ones.
Eddie Murphy,

3096
02:21:18,211 --> 02:21:21,530
same way you know,
but you know,

3097
02:21:21,700 --> 02:21:26,700
they go up and they go down depending on
how much attention they're putting to 

3098
02:21:26,700 --> 02:21:30,071
the act,
depending on how much other stuff 

3099
02:21:30,071 --> 02:21:30,071
they're doing on the side,
what's going on in their life.

3100
02:21:30,071 --> 02:21:33,881
But in my opinion,
Kennison is the best example for young 

3101
02:21:33,881 --> 02:21:34,910
comics or what can happen,
how you can go from,

3102
02:21:34,911 --> 02:21:39,911
in my opinion,
being the greatest of all time with 

3103
02:21:39,911 --> 02:21:41,930
louder than hell to being really 
mediocre towards his later work.

3104
02:21:41,931 --> 02:21:42,950
Like just no joe.

3105
02:21:43,020 --> 02:21:44,910
I mean,
are you saying that is like,

3106
02:21:45,000 --> 02:21:48,540
look at this as what can happen to do,
you don't want that?

3107
02:21:48,870 --> 02:21:53,870
We definitely don't want that.
So who would be somebody not the 

3108
02:21:53,870 --> 02:21:56,631
opposite of Sam?
Somebody who kind of turned it around a 

3109
02:21:56,631 --> 02:22:01,221
little bit or.
Or did you turn it around and turned it 

3110
02:22:01,221 --> 02:22:03,360
down but maintained the level and even 
improved on Louis?

3111
02:22:03,361 --> 02:22:04,560
CK is a good example of.
Okay,

3112
02:22:04,561 --> 02:22:06,410
there you go.
David tells a great exhibit.

3113
02:22:06,420 --> 02:22:09,360
Tell Dave attell constantly maintains 
constantly.

3114
02:22:10,230 --> 02:22:12,720
Dave Chappelle's,
another you see Chappelle,

3115
02:22:13,440 --> 02:22:16,740
Chappelle had that incident,
didn't do what was their tour.

3116
02:22:16,741 --> 02:22:18,450
And Hartford.
I did the whole oddball tour.

3117
02:22:18,451 --> 02:22:20,540
What the fuck happened there?
Um,

3118
02:22:20,730 --> 02:22:22,770
I'll tell you what.
First of all,

3119
02:22:22,771 --> 02:22:26,250
that Hartford show was late.

3120
02:22:26,460 --> 02:22:28,620
Okay.
So everything was set and they said,

3121
02:22:28,621 --> 02:22:32,130
well,
why don't we do Hartford on a Thursday?

3122
02:22:33,060 --> 02:22:35,250
Most of the shows are done Friday,
Saturday,

3123
02:22:35,251 --> 02:22:36,290
and Sunday.
So they said,

3124
02:22:36,300 --> 02:22:40,770
let's do Hartford on a Thursday and the,
and these are the shows we did,

3125
02:22:41,230 --> 02:22:42,780
you know,
Dallas,

3126
02:22:43,200 --> 02:22:45,240
Houston,
Austin,

3127
02:22:45,241 --> 02:22:47,160
New York,
Boston,

3128
02:22:47,400 --> 02:22:48,600
Detroit,
big cities.

3129
02:22:48,601 --> 02:22:50,940
Hartford's not really that big of a 
city.

3130
02:22:51,030 --> 02:22:56,030
Anyway,
Thursday night the ticket sales are kind

3131
02:22:56,491 --> 02:23:01,491
of soft and they released a lot of 
tickets so I went on and did my thing on

3132
02:23:02,131 --> 02:23:03,720
the side stage.
It was fine.

3133
02:23:03,721 --> 02:23:08,721
I didn't notice any like bad energy or 
these guys are punks or white trash or 

3134
02:23:08,721 --> 02:23:13,671
tough or whatever.
I had fun and then I went inside to the 

3135
02:23:13,671 --> 02:23:16,860
amphitheater and it seemed okay.
I mean you couldn't hear.

3136
02:23:16,861 --> 02:23:19,650
I mean it wasn't sold out.
There's maybe 10,000

3137
02:23:19,651 --> 02:23:24,651
people there so.
But the acoustics were all that great 

3138
02:23:24,651 --> 02:23:25,740
and the acts weren't having all that 
much fun based.

3139
02:23:25,740 --> 02:23:28,830
I think of the acoustics maybe a little 
bit of the crowd.

3140
02:23:29,460 --> 02:23:32,640
And then Dave went on and actually I 
left.

3141
02:23:32,641 --> 02:23:37,641
I kind of right after you went on,
I shuttled back to the hotel which is 

3142
02:23:37,641 --> 02:23:39,600
around the corner and then Jeff Ross 
came back in.

3143
02:23:39,610 --> 02:23:44,610
It was just on twitter that,
that Dave Chappelle start reading a book

3144
02:23:44,761 --> 02:23:48,180
on stage and had a meltdown and you 
know,

3145
02:23:48,181 --> 02:23:52,050
it was just sitting there and smoking a 
cigarette and caused,

3146
02:23:52,670 --> 02:23:53,670
you know,
not chaos,

3147
02:23:53,671 --> 02:23:55,620
but they were like booing him or walk it
out.

3148
02:23:56,070 --> 02:23:58,080
And that was it.
And that just started the buzz,

3149
02:23:58,081 --> 02:24:03,081
like he had a meltdown and I saw him 
that night in the elevator and I'm not 

3150
02:24:03,081 --> 02:24:06,051
really friendly with them.
He knows my face and he was just 

3151
02:24:06,051 --> 02:24:08,541
basically basically still fuming at the 
audience knowing like they,

3152
02:24:10,110 --> 02:24:15,110
they almost don't know comedy.
He was upset with the audience at that 

3153
02:24:15,110 --> 02:24:15,110
point.

3154
02:24:15,110 --> 02:24:19,100
And.
But you didn't feel like it was about 

3155
02:24:19,100 --> 02:24:19,100
audience when you are on stage.
Wasn't a battle.

3156
02:24:19,100 --> 02:24:20,070
Yes.
My experience,

3157
02:24:20,340 --> 02:24:23,670
my little stage that I would do for 
every city,

3158
02:24:24,270 --> 02:24:28,650
it was par for the course up to that.
I mean that was our fourth show.

3159
02:24:28,710 --> 02:24:30,870
So you think they were saving their 
Douchey ness for him?

3160
02:24:30,871 --> 02:24:33,000
Maybe.
I mean,

3161
02:24:33,600 --> 02:24:38,600
I don't know what they were saving it.
I just think that maybe because yeah,

3162
02:24:40,561 --> 02:24:44,910
that maybe that attracted that kind of 
crowd that's going to yell out stuff and

3163
02:24:44,911 --> 02:24:47,880
like prego up Chappelle for good about 
flight of the conchords.

3164
02:24:47,881 --> 02:24:49,710
So we're drunk.
It's Thursday night.

3165
02:24:49,711 --> 02:24:51,300
It's hard for,
you know,

3166
02:24:51,700 --> 02:24:54,450
women with the flight of the conchords 
went on before.

3167
02:24:54,650 --> 02:24:55,830
Yeah,
they always would.

3168
02:24:56,610 --> 02:24:58,890
How long does that go on for that?
Here's the deal.

3169
02:24:59,760 --> 02:25:02,190
They did very well.
They were solid.

3170
02:25:02,191 --> 02:25:04,770
They would do about 55 minutes.

3171
02:25:05,100 --> 02:25:07,760
They have a very big following.
So they.

3172
02:25:07,980 --> 02:25:10,670
The conch big following.
Yes are awesome.

3173
02:25:11,000 --> 02:25:16,000
They have a very big following and to me
they were have to chime in there.

3174
02:25:16,741 --> 02:25:18,780
Awesome.
Because I love them.

3175
02:25:18,781 --> 02:25:23,781
They're great.
I love their show to does have anything 

3176
02:25:23,781 --> 02:25:23,781
to do with this.
Okay.

3177
02:25:23,781 --> 02:25:27,560
But every night they came on and they 
did their hour and they were solid.

3178
02:25:27,671 --> 02:25:30,670
They kept the couples happy.
They had fans of the show.

3179
02:25:30,671 --> 02:25:35,671
There's monitors everywhere.
Occasionally you would hear someone who 

3180
02:25:35,671 --> 02:25:39,031
were Chappelle once in a while and then 
other people just sat there and they 

3181
02:25:39,031 --> 02:25:39,031
know,
okay,

3182
02:25:39,031 --> 02:25:43,291
Chapelle is going to come on an hour.
They had a set list and then chappelle 

3183
02:25:43,291 --> 02:25:45,340
would come on and do his thing.
So I thought it was,

3184
02:25:45,880 --> 02:25:46,840
you know,
it was a nice.

3185
02:25:47,080 --> 02:25:51,400
It was good bit of the doing the lineup,
having Chappelle closed it.

3186
02:25:51,880 --> 02:25:52,620
Yeah.
That's weird

3187
02:25:52,650 --> 02:25:57,650
though to go on after a musical act like
you know that as a comedian when the 

3188
02:25:57,650 --> 02:25:57,840
musical act goes up and then you go on 
afterwards.

3189
02:25:58,690 --> 02:25:59,550
Weird energy.
Well,

3190
02:25:59,730 --> 02:26:03,940
I mean you had,
they would end and then the.

3191
02:26:04,010 --> 02:26:06,710
Then the Dj starts up,
then you get the hip hop going.

3192
02:26:06,730 --> 02:26:11,730
It changes the whole vibe.
It's about a 15 minute switch over 15 

3193
02:26:11,730 --> 02:26:12,270
minutes.
Yeah,

3194
02:26:12,320 --> 02:26:17,320
10.
It's not like goodnight flight of the 

3195
02:26:17,320 --> 02:26:17,320
conchords boom,
Dave Chappelle.

3196
02:26:17,320 --> 02:26:17,320
It's like,
okay,

3197
02:26:17,320 --> 02:26:18,490
I've music.
They're done.

3198
02:26:19,000 --> 02:26:23,250
They take the stage off and then the hip
hop guy starts going.

3199
02:26:23,300 --> 02:26:25,690
People were dancing and feeling good,
like excited.

3200
02:26:25,691 --> 02:26:30,691
Chappelle's going to come out and then 
maybe after eight or nine minutes the 

3201
02:26:30,691 --> 02:26:33,180
curtain drops and people get more 
excited.

3202
02:26:33,181 --> 02:26:38,181
And you didn't exactly see the actual 
city that particular night at Hartford 

3203
02:26:39,281 --> 02:26:40,900
that moment?
No.

3204
02:26:41,050 --> 02:26:42,880
I saw,
you know,

3205
02:26:42,881 --> 02:26:47,881
I saw.
I either would watch chapelle take the 

3206
02:26:47,881 --> 02:26:51,001
stage from the side of the stage or I 
would watch him from the audience take 

3207
02:26:51,671 --> 02:26:53,620
the stage and probably,
you know,

3208
02:26:53,680 --> 02:26:56,120
13 out of 16 times I saw that.
Well he's.

3209
02:26:56,280 --> 02:26:59,600
Anyway,
he's a great example of a guy who hasn't

3210
02:26:59,610 --> 02:27:00,430
gotten worse.
Got,

3211
02:27:00,480 --> 02:27:02,220
got it better.
Probably Bill Burr,

3212
02:27:02,250 --> 02:27:02,970
another example,

3213
02:27:03,050 --> 02:27:04,610
bill burrs on the rise.
Joey,

3214
02:27:05,330 --> 02:27:07,640
Joey,
Joey got better already movie.

3215
02:27:07,641 --> 02:27:12,641
I saw him.
He's in one of the commercials for that 

3216
02:27:12,641 --> 02:27:12,930
Deniro still thing.
Yeah.

3217
02:27:13,130 --> 02:27:18,130
Should be interesting.
So there are guys that are getting 

3218
02:27:18,130 --> 02:27:18,130
better,
I guess you know,

3219
02:27:18,130 --> 02:27:20,000
Kennison for whatever reason,
maybe the drugs got to him the fame.

3220
02:27:20,001 --> 02:27:21,760
I know he would do that main room and

3221
02:27:22,000 --> 02:27:23,140
it's all the above,
man.

3222
02:27:23,200 --> 02:27:25,750
All the above can get to you for sure.
Anything can get to you.

3223
02:27:26,310 --> 02:27:31,310
If anything that takes your focus away 
from the actual art itself.

3224
02:27:31,601 --> 02:27:36,130
I found that before when I'm too busy 
with my life that my comedy suffered too

3225
02:27:36,131 --> 02:27:41,131
busy with other stuff outside of comedy.
My standup suffers and that's the worst 

3226
02:27:41,131 --> 02:27:45,721
feeling.
Like I don't mind if other things I do 

3227
02:27:45,721 --> 02:27:47,521
don't work that well,
but what I really mind is when stand up 

3228
02:27:47,521 --> 02:27:50,591
does not work that well,
that that really drives me fucking 

3229
02:27:50,591 --> 02:27:50,591
crazy.

3230
02:27:50,591 --> 02:27:51,370
It is different just being off stage for
three to four days.

3231
02:27:51,371 --> 02:27:52,870
You go back up there and it's was like,
Whoa,

3232
02:27:52,871 --> 02:27:54,700
this is kind of wobbly.
I'm a little different.

3233
02:27:54,701 --> 02:27:55,810
I mean,
that's how I feel,

3234
02:27:56,110 --> 02:28:01,110
you know,
just maybe at the comedy store for 

3235
02:28:01,110 --> 02:28:01,110
example,
or you know,

3236
02:28:01,110 --> 02:28:01,810
one of these shows around town.
Yeah.

3237
02:28:01,811 --> 02:28:03,560
And when you take like a couple of 
months,

3238
02:28:03,570 --> 02:28:06,040
all I've never done that.
I've never done.

3239
02:28:06,041 --> 02:28:07,250
That isn't a weird.

3240
02:28:07,350 --> 02:28:12,350
Comedy is one of those things.
It's almost like running like you have 

3241
02:28:12,350 --> 02:28:12,350
to get in comedy shape,

3242
02:28:12,350 --> 02:28:14,380
comedy shape and stay there,
stay there,

3243
02:28:14,410 --> 02:28:17,230
don't fuck around.
Because if you get out of comedy shake,

3244
02:28:17,231 --> 02:28:21,980
it's carried hard to get back in.
I've had that feeling and it's not fun.

3245
02:28:22,010 --> 02:28:23,530
Not Fun,
but I,

3246
02:28:23,531 --> 02:28:28,430
I mean I've heard you mentioned a lot 
how podcasting is like cross training.

3247
02:28:28,820 --> 02:28:33,820
I believe it is.
I believe podcasting is cross training 

3248
02:28:33,820 --> 02:28:36,551
and oddly enough I think that podcasting
and stand up also help my,

3249
02:28:38,870 --> 02:28:41,180
my mma commentary.
Oh really?

3250
02:28:41,540 --> 02:28:43,070
Yeah.
Yeah.

3251
02:28:43,220 --> 02:28:46,070
And that made commentary for me is like,
you know,

3252
02:28:46,071 --> 02:28:46,360
we,
we,

3253
02:28:46,520 --> 02:28:51,520
you and I have had many conversations 
about sports because I don't know shit 

3254
02:28:51,520 --> 02:28:54,881
about sports.
It's always a goof when you try to 

3255
02:28:54,881 --> 02:28:54,881
explain to me something that's 
happening,

3256
02:28:54,881 --> 02:28:57,560
but MMA is the only sport that I really,
really,

3257
02:28:57,561 --> 02:29:01,100
really pay attention to and I'm,
I'm watching every fucking thing I can.

3258
02:29:01,370 --> 02:29:04,940
I watch all the access TV fights with 
smaller organizations.

3259
02:29:04,941 --> 02:29:09,941
I watched,
I watched probably 15 hours of mma a 

3260
02:29:10,971 --> 02:29:15,971
week.
You're watching it as homework or just 

3261
02:29:15,971 --> 02:29:15,971
you'd love it?
I just like it.

3262
02:29:15,971 --> 02:29:16,100
I always like it.

3263
02:29:16,190 --> 02:29:17,840
I watched in the background while I'm 
writing.

3264
02:29:17,841 --> 02:29:22,841
Sometimes I like watching fights.
I've always liked watching fights and 

3265
02:29:22,841 --> 02:29:22,940
not just like,
I don't.

3266
02:29:22,941 --> 02:29:27,941
Not necessarily even for brutality.
I watched like Jujitsu matches where no 

3267
02:29:27,941 --> 02:29:28,700
one gets hurt.
You guys just tap.

3268
02:29:28,730 --> 02:29:33,730
I like watching technique.
I like watching guys who know what 

3269
02:29:33,730 --> 02:29:35,930
they're doing.
I like watching people overcome specific

3270
02:29:35,931 --> 02:29:38,990
challenges.
Like an MMA in my opinion,

3271
02:29:38,991 --> 02:29:42,410
is probably the most difficult physical 
challenge a person can,

3272
02:29:42,620 --> 02:29:45,470
can attempt to try to be an MMA 
champion.

3273
02:29:45,860 --> 02:29:47,780
So when I see,
you know,

3274
02:29:47,781 --> 02:29:50,990
if I watch or more ties and other thing,
I watch a lot of.

3275
02:29:51,260 --> 02:29:53,600
I watched a lot of kickboxing,
a lot of kickboxing.

3276
02:29:53,680 --> 02:29:54,860
Man,
whenever it's on tv,

3277
02:29:54,861 --> 02:29:59,861
I watch like the glory promotions or 
Gloria is this new organization that's 

3278
02:29:59,861 --> 02:30:01,700
on Spike TV,
fucking incredible man,

3279
02:30:02,180 --> 02:30:07,180
the highest level kickboxers in the 
world and they're all fighting on spike 

3280
02:30:07,180 --> 02:30:07,940
TV and they've got this big organization
called glory.

3281
02:30:07,940 --> 02:30:11,900
So it's developing all this new talent 
and it's also like getting people really

3282
02:30:11,901 --> 02:30:16,901
excited about kickboxing into the same 
sort of the same way they got excited 

3283
02:30:16,901 --> 02:30:16,901
about mma.
And I think that,

3284
02:30:17,420 --> 02:30:22,420
um,
whether it's that or whether it's 

3285
02:30:22,420 --> 02:30:24,820
wrestling or Jujitsu or kickboxing,
what I get out of that is I get out when

3286
02:30:26,031 --> 02:30:28,850
you watching the best guys in the world 
do something,

3287
02:30:29,060 --> 02:30:34,060
whatever the fuck it is,
especially when it's something as 

3288
02:30:34,060 --> 02:30:36,311
dangerous as combat sports,
you get a charge out of watching people 

3289
02:30:36,311 --> 02:30:38,810
perform and compete.
And I find that it's very motivational.

3290
02:30:39,140 --> 02:30:41,240
It's very inspirational.
It's very motivational.

3291
02:30:41,241 --> 02:30:45,630
It gives me energy and you're right 
there ringside,

3292
02:30:45,650 --> 02:30:48,070
you feel it.
And then you're obviously in the,

3293
02:30:48,071 --> 02:30:50,890
in the octagon after the.
You're feeling that.

3294
02:30:50,900 --> 02:30:51,620
Yeah,
you feel it,

3295
02:30:51,621 --> 02:30:52,580
man.
You feel it.

3296
02:30:52,600 --> 02:30:57,460
You hear the slap of the impact of Shins
on heads and you know,

3297
02:30:57,500 --> 02:31:00,140
and thighs and fucking fist to belly.

3298
02:31:00,320 --> 02:31:02,690
You feel all of it.
You feel the body slams you.

3299
02:31:02,691 --> 02:31:04,230
You'd be feeling on the table like,
uh,

3300
02:31:04,231 --> 02:31:09,231
my,
my hands on the table and when guys get 

3301
02:31:09,231 --> 02:31:09,231
slammed,
boom on the mat,

3302
02:31:09,231 --> 02:31:11,810
I literally could feel it in my hands 
often.

3303
02:31:12,700 --> 02:31:17,700
And that,
that helps you have a better empathy for

3304
02:31:17,931 --> 02:31:19,590
these guys.
Yeah,

3305
02:31:19,591 --> 02:31:23,520
well I've always had empathy and 
sympathy or tried to relate.

3306
02:31:23,550 --> 02:31:28,550
You know,
I've never fought in mixed martial arts 

3307
02:31:28,550 --> 02:31:28,550
before,
but I had a lot of taekwondo match.

3308
02:31:28,550 --> 02:31:30,000
I had a lot of kickboxing,
I had a few kickboxing matches,

3309
02:31:30,001 --> 02:31:31,410
but a lot of the time,
kickboxing,

3310
02:31:31,670 --> 02:31:33,330
a lot of times sparring,
a lot of,

3311
02:31:33,331 --> 02:31:37,600
a lot of years invested in martial arts 
and martial arts competition.

3312
02:31:37,601 --> 02:31:40,680
So I,
I kind of have a sense without doing it,

3313
02:31:40,710 --> 02:31:43,590
of what it means to these guys.
So it means a lot to me,

3314
02:31:44,340 --> 02:31:47,610
but there's a lot of issues with,
uh,

3315
02:31:48,060 --> 02:31:51,030
with,
with MMA as it stands today,

3316
02:31:51,390 --> 02:31:54,690
you know,
judging and there's a lot of issues with

3317
02:31:55,310 --> 02:32:00,310
the way he fights are scored,
the actual scoring system itself and 

3318
02:32:00,310 --> 02:32:00,810
refereeing.

3319
02:32:00,810 --> 02:32:05,160
And is it something that's fixable?
It's just typical growth of the sport.

3320
02:32:05,161 --> 02:32:06,000
It's not.
No,

3321
02:32:06,001 --> 02:32:11,001
it's definitely,
definitely stuff that's fixable and the 

3322
02:32:11,001 --> 02:32:13,071
UFC has done its best.
I think they need to update the gloves 

3323
02:32:13,071 --> 02:32:13,071
too.
I think there's too many.

3324
02:32:13,071 --> 02:32:14,130
There's a real problem with guys getting
poked in the eyes.

3325
02:32:14,580 --> 02:32:16,740
There's a lot of that.
I really don't like that at all.

3326
02:32:16,741 --> 02:32:19,110
It drives me crazy.
It happens too often.

3327
02:32:19,111 --> 02:32:20,670
It seems to me like,
you know,

3328
02:32:20,671 --> 02:32:25,671
there's that old expression doing the 
same thing over and over again and 

3329
02:32:25,671 --> 02:32:26,550
hoping for sanity,
the definition of insanity.

3330
02:32:26,700 --> 02:32:31,700
And that's what we're doing with MMA.
We do the same things over and over 

3331
02:32:31,700 --> 02:32:34,371
again.
We have these open finger gloves and 

3332
02:32:34,371 --> 02:32:35,820
guys keep getting poked and we're having
a lot of detached retinas out.

3333
02:32:36,000 --> 02:32:40,860
A lot of guys are having eye surgery.
Like Michael Bisping had eye surgery.

3334
02:32:41,830 --> 02:32:45,270
Uh,
Alan Belcher had eye surgery,

3335
02:32:45,480 --> 02:32:50,480
got quite,
a few guys have had issues with their 

3336
02:32:50,480 --> 02:32:52,080
eyes and so that's a fixable problem I 
think it is.

3337
02:32:52,090 --> 02:32:52,480
Yeah,
I think,

3338
02:32:52,500 --> 02:32:53,040
yeah,
you're right.

3339
02:32:53,180 --> 02:32:55,050
Civil Issue Mittens are dead,
right?

3340
02:32:55,200 --> 02:32:56,450
That was my,
actually my,

3341
02:32:56,540 --> 02:33:00,450
my idea was to come up with something 
that it pads the knuckles,

3342
02:33:00,600 --> 02:33:03,900
but there's like a smooth cover over the
tip of the fingers,

3343
02:33:04,140 --> 02:33:08,610
a smooth cover because in grappling you 
don't really grab like this,

3344
02:33:08,760 --> 02:33:11,550
you grab most of what you do.
You grab like this,

3345
02:33:11,630 --> 02:33:16,630
you look and gene labelle was actually 
showing me yesterday the way that he 

3346
02:33:16,630 --> 02:33:16,650
does it,
which is different.

3347
02:33:16,890 --> 02:33:19,050
He likes to squeeze down on all the 
fingers.

3348
02:33:19,200 --> 02:33:22,470
He likes to get his thumb in here and 
squeezed down like that because it feels

3349
02:33:22,471 --> 02:33:24,960
like it's harder to break and he might 
be right there.

3350
02:33:25,430 --> 02:33:30,430
Um,
but in any case you're okay doing this 

3351
02:33:30,430 --> 02:33:34,011
like palm to palm,
like that's a deviation in the way you 

3352
02:33:34,011 --> 02:33:38,121
have to grapple anyway between straight 
grappling with no gloves on an mma 

3353
02:33:38,121 --> 02:33:39,930
because of the size of the gloves 
itself.

3354
02:33:40,080 --> 02:33:41,430
And then maybe they do,
they do.

3355
02:33:41,550 --> 02:33:43,110
They do use gloves?
Yes.

3356
02:33:43,140 --> 02:33:46,080
Yes you do.
Is there a bear gloves anywhere and kind

3357
02:33:46,081 --> 02:33:51,081
of not in America,
but I'm sure they're still doing it in 

3358
02:33:51,081 --> 02:33:51,081
other parts of the world.
I mean,

3359
02:33:51,081 --> 02:33:52,680
I'm sure in Brazil that was how it all 
started out.

3360
02:33:52,681 --> 02:33:54,890
I'll start out called they called it 
valley Tudo,

3361
02:33:54,900 --> 02:33:59,520
which means anything goes and I'm with 
the early UFC.

3362
02:33:59,521 --> 02:34:00,960
It was bare knuckle.
In fact,

3363
02:34:00,961 --> 02:34:04,770
tank Abbott was the first guy to 
voluntarily wear gloves.

3364
02:34:05,010 --> 02:34:08,010
He decided to wear these chuck norris 
gloves used to buy from century.

3365
02:34:08,300 --> 02:34:10,980
You decide to wear those into the 
octagon.

3366
02:34:10,981 --> 02:34:15,981
I'm pretty sure he was the first guy in 
the UFC to wear gloves and then 

3367
02:34:15,981 --> 02:34:16,860
[inaudible] started wearing those 
gloves.

3368
02:34:16,861 --> 02:34:19,900
A lot of guys started wearing those 
gloves and then it became mandatory.

3369
02:34:20,110 --> 02:34:25,110
But when Vito or fought in the UFC when 
he was 19 years old and a dose in 

3370
02:34:25,110 --> 02:34:26,110
Alabama,
UFC 12,

3371
02:34:26,290 --> 02:34:30,430
he wore those gloves and no one else had
ever seen those fucking gloves before.

3372
02:34:31,390 --> 02:34:33,010
Besides a tank.
Abbott,

3373
02:34:33,180 --> 02:34:34,990
you know,
like no one I think.

3374
02:34:35,170 --> 02:34:35,620
I think.
Yeah,

3375
02:34:35,621 --> 02:34:37,480
I think it was tank Abbott was the only 
one who had warned them,

3376
02:34:37,750 --> 02:34:40,450
so vito or wearing them to a bare 
knuckle fight,

3377
02:34:40,660 --> 02:34:42,970
like I know a lot of the guys that were 
in that tournament with him,

3378
02:34:43,150 --> 02:34:48,150
they were fighting bare knuckle and came
out and because of the padding on the 

3379
02:34:48,150 --> 02:34:51,160
gloves you could really tee off on guys,
you don't have to worry about protecting

3380
02:34:51,161 --> 02:34:51,730
your knuckles.

3381
02:34:51,910 --> 02:34:53,150
Yeah,
you're not going to hurt your nose.

3382
02:34:53,690 --> 02:34:54,860
So that's been,
you know,

3383
02:34:54,861 --> 02:34:57,660
that was the first thing that they did,
you know,

3384
02:34:57,720 --> 02:35:00,080
the adding of the gloves,
which I think was a good step,

3385
02:35:00,081 --> 02:35:05,081
but I think the next step is really 
figuring out how to cover the 

3386
02:35:05,081 --> 02:35:05,720
fingertips.
Too many guys are getting poked.

3387
02:35:07,060 --> 02:35:10,600
Speaking of the poking,
can I use the restroom real quick again?

3388
02:35:11,250 --> 02:35:13,100
I'm sorry.
I use the restroom.

3389
02:35:13,120 --> 02:35:14,010
We're going to wrap this up.
Okay.

3390
02:35:14,011 --> 02:35:16,390
I'll be right back.
When your show is brody.

3391
02:35:16,391 --> 02:35:18,520
Enjoy it.
When is it on brody Stevens.

3392
02:35:18,620 --> 02:35:22,870
Enjoy it every Sunday.
Nine o'clock at night.

3393
02:35:22,871 --> 02:35:24,100
Who's your lead in?
What's on right before,

3394
02:35:24,110 --> 02:35:25,030
you know,
it's 12:00.

3395
02:35:25,060 --> 02:35:26,950
Has it been tosh?
I thought it was 12:00

3396
02:35:27,220 --> 02:35:28,300
at midnight,
right?

3397
02:35:28,301 --> 02:35:29,920
What?
I say you said 9:00.

3398
02:35:29,940 --> 02:35:30,940
Oh,
I get confused.

3399
02:35:31,000 --> 02:35:36,000
Nine o'clock midnights for the next six 
weeks,

3400
02:35:37,240 --> 02:35:39,940
so two and night.
Six weeks to go.

3401
02:35:40,600 --> 02:35:43,480
Beautiful.
12 episodes to a night for six weeks.

3402
02:35:43,580 --> 02:35:47,360
So let's watch the shit out of that show
and make brody a Goddamn star.

3403
02:35:47,450 --> 02:35:52,450
Here's the thing.
I'm going to come back though and then 

3404
02:35:52,450 --> 02:35:52,450
we'll talk.
Let me go urinate your preview.

3405
02:35:52,450 --> 02:35:52,460
Okay.
Here we go.

3406
02:35:54,490 --> 02:35:56,780
Never seems like he's doing material at 
all.

3407
02:35:56,781 --> 02:35:59,750
He's just yelling,
color Jewish.

3408
02:35:59,751 --> 02:36:02,750
I just get it.
Is never was about the jokes.

3409
02:36:02,751 --> 02:36:04,640
It was about the in between of the 
jokes.

3410
02:36:04,730 --> 02:36:09,730
Why did you not?
He really was so different from 

3411
02:36:09,730 --> 02:36:14,621
everybody else doing comedy that we saw.
He used to be strange and it was always 

3412
02:36:14,621 --> 02:36:19,061
just funny.
Then it just became strange from the 

3413
02:36:19,061 --> 02:36:19,061
network.
That doesn't do drama.

3414
02:36:19,100 --> 02:36:21,350
I think I asked him,
are you on your medication?

3415
02:36:21,351 --> 02:36:21,980
And he said,
no.

3416
02:36:23,960 --> 02:36:27,470
Here comes a brand new drama where you 
in a mental hospital.

3417
02:36:30,530 --> 02:36:34,190
It's about family are right.
If you get some jokes,

3418
02:36:34,250 --> 02:36:37,700
this is part of the process.
Having your mom tell you that you're not

3419
02:36:37,701 --> 02:36:40,100
funny.
Friendship.

3420
02:36:40,910 --> 02:36:42,230
Hey Zack.
It's brody.

3421
02:36:42,420 --> 02:36:43,220
Okay.
Brody Curry.

3422
02:36:43,221 --> 02:36:48,221
I have a telemarketer on the other line.
Was funniest when he's lost.

3423
02:36:48,261 --> 02:36:50,180
Complete control.
Brody offstage.

3424
02:36:50,300 --> 02:36:52,250
Onstage.
Not much of a difference.

3425
02:36:52,370 --> 02:36:55,250
You're going to hang out with brody.
He just have to enjoy it.

3426
02:36:55,370 --> 02:36:56,540
I mean,
pardon the Pun.

3427
02:36:56,990 --> 02:36:59,570
If I watch this thing,
I'm thinking this brody guy

3428
02:36:59,950 --> 02:37:01,390
is weird.

3429
02:37:01,430 --> 02:37:02,960
Yeah.
Brody Stevens.

3430
02:37:02,961 --> 02:37:05,390
Enjoy it.
Comedy central's verse drama.

3431
02:37:05,420 --> 02:37:10,420
New episodes.
Sundays at midnight and starting 

3432
02:37:10,420 --> 02:37:10,420
December first.

3433
02:37:10,420 --> 02:37:11,610
I like how they call it drama.
Why are they doing that?

3434
02:37:11,760 --> 02:37:15,680
Because it is very documentary style.
Brody.

3435
02:37:16,250 --> 02:37:21,250
Like they just follow them around pretty
much and hang out and like edit it 

3436
02:37:21,250 --> 02:37:21,250
together.
Yeah,

3437
02:37:21,250 --> 02:37:21,770
but it's funny.
So that was at a drama.

3438
02:37:21,800 --> 02:37:26,800
Yeah.
It's because there's a lot of drama in 

3439
02:37:26,800 --> 02:37:26,800
it.
I guess

3440
02:37:26,800 --> 02:37:29,300
you know what they're doing.
They're just avoiding calling into 

3441
02:37:29,300 --> 02:37:29,300
reality show.
Yeah,

3442
02:37:29,300 --> 02:37:29,300
true.
That's what they're doing.

3443
02:37:29,300 --> 02:37:31,720
They're calling you out our first drama,
which is probably smart.

3444
02:37:31,990 --> 02:37:34,620
That avoids the stink of reality,
I think.

3445
02:37:34,960 --> 02:37:39,960
Yeah.
The word reality show because of like 

3446
02:37:39,960 --> 02:37:39,960
the Kardashians.
Exactly.

3447
02:37:39,960 --> 02:37:41,560
Ponchos and all this nonsense.
Well,

3448
02:37:41,561 --> 02:37:42,940
you know,
they're bullshitting you,

3449
02:37:43,240 --> 02:37:46,510
you know that it's set up scenarios when
you see a setup scenario,

3450
02:37:46,511 --> 02:37:48,490
if they're set,
you don't have any of that.

3451
02:37:49,170 --> 02:37:51,130
Yeah,
we can call it the drama.

3452
02:37:51,550 --> 02:37:54,370
I think it shouldn't be a drama.
I think it should be the actual reality.

3453
02:37:54,970 --> 02:37:57,850
Comedy Central's first drama.
So it's a joke.

3454
02:37:57,851 --> 02:37:59,750
It's a joke.
That's a joke.

3455
02:38:00,890 --> 02:38:03,850
I mean there is drama,
but then there's also compensate.

3456
02:38:04,600 --> 02:38:07,300
You want to know what's comedy?
January 24th.

3457
02:38:07,330 --> 02:38:10,630
I'll be at the Chicago theater tickets.
Go on sale tomorrow morning.

3458
02:38:10,660 --> 02:38:12,730
Early presale starts early.

3459
02:38:12,730 --> 02:38:17,050
It'll be on my twitter.
I'm the a presale password is finale.

3460
02:38:17,290 --> 02:38:19,550
That's January 24th.
Uh,

3461
02:38:19,630 --> 02:38:21,520
I don't know who's going to be with me.
We haven't figured it out yet,

3462
02:38:21,521 --> 02:38:23,650
but we're going to have a party bitches.
It should be a lot of fun.

3463
02:38:23,651 --> 02:38:25,810
Chicago in January.
How do you go wrong?

3464
02:38:26,220 --> 02:38:30,790
And we'll be back tomorrow with that 
dude who worked for marine land.

3465
02:38:30,910 --> 02:38:34,810
Should be pre fill filled the mirrors 
should be pretty fucking fascinating,

3466
02:38:34,811 --> 02:38:36,860
man.
This is gonna.

3467
02:38:36,861 --> 02:38:41,861
Be really bizarre.
Can I talk about all the shit that he 

3468
02:38:41,861 --> 02:38:46,621
went through at marine land and a 
training a Walrus and apparently it's 

3469
02:38:46,621 --> 02:38:48,160
going to tell some disturbing shit.
What are you going to?

3470
02:38:48,280 --> 02:38:53,280
Uh,
just me and brody and Sam Brody said 

3471
02:38:53,280 --> 02:38:55,130
he's not going to.
I'm going to check with my sister.

3472
02:38:55,131 --> 02:39:00,131
I'll know for sure tonight.
She's sending me these files and excels 

3473
02:39:00,470 --> 02:39:01,610
and download

3474
02:39:01,780 --> 02:39:02,890
and joy yet

3475
02:39:03,320 --> 02:39:04,910
enjoy it.
You got it.

3476
02:39:06,050 --> 02:39:11,050
The Crest Theater December 13th with 
Tony Hinchcliffe and at the Mirage in 

3477
02:39:11,451 --> 02:39:16,070
Vegas on December 27th with Brian Cowen 
and Joey Diaz.

3478
02:39:16,120 --> 02:39:20,510
She's off the chain bitches that,
that showed that when it's talking about

3479
02:39:20,511 --> 02:39:21,590
his December 11,
by the way,

3480
02:39:21,591 --> 02:39:23,690
at the San Jose Improv.
Okay.

3481
02:39:23,691 --> 02:39:25,610
That's a different show.
Sam Brody Stevens,

3482
02:39:25,611 --> 02:39:28,630
Brian Red Band,
Sam Tripoli San Jose Improv,

3483
02:39:28,730 --> 02:39:31,010
an awesome venue.
One of the best clubs.

3484
02:39:31,011 --> 02:39:34,130
Ninety eight percent confirmed an 18 
percent gay.

3485
02:39:34,131 --> 02:39:39,131
That club.
It's interesting that the club is 50 

3486
02:39:39,131 --> 02:39:43,901
percent less scaling whatever theater in
Sacramento.

3487
02:39:43,971 --> 02:39:46,310
That's December 13th.
And again the Mirage,

3488
02:39:46,340 --> 02:39:49,460
December 27th.
I'll be at the aquafresh theater.

3489
02:39:49,730 --> 02:39:51,620
Getting your shit together.

we love the fuck out of your buddy and 
don't let anybody give you a hard time

They can all go fuck themselves man.

3492

02:39:57,630 --> 02:39:58,740
You got it.
You've been a friend,

3494
02:39:58,741 --> 02:39:59,520
Joe.
I felt.

3495
02:40:00,300 --> 02:40:00,640
No,

3496
02:40:00,700 --> 02:40:04,460
I love you for being here.
Thank you.

3497

Enjoy it.

3520
02:41:23,130 --> 02:41:23,500
Oh.
