1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,910
The general good experience,
so I went,

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:07,080
I went to like a day of media training
and it was a.

3
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:13,430
I did,
I did and it was the worst part was I've

4
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:16,050
done interviews and I've been fine
before,

5
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:19,020
but I got this guy sitting across from
me who's,

6
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:22,080
who's interviewing me doing this mock
interview and then I've got the

7
00:00:22,081 --> 00:00:25,320
publicist and my writing partner and
they're just staring at me and that will

8
00:00:25,321 --> 00:00:26,340
listen.
I can't do it.

9
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:27,810
Right.
All the pressures there.

10
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:31,640
Who's teaching you?
Who's teaching this training?

11
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:32,850
Here's where they right away.
Like,

12
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:33,780
you kind of suck at.
This.

13
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:36,180
Absolutely works.
I mean,

14
00:00:36,181 --> 00:00:38,580
they were really nice about it.
They were like,

15
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:40,230
okay,
well there's some,

16
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:42,630
there's some room for improvement.
Oh my God.

17
00:00:42,631 --> 00:00:43,500
Really?
Oh yeah.

18
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:44,670
No,
it was the worst.

19
00:00:44,671 --> 00:00:47,640
It will seem like a natural.
I mean there's what is there to teach

20
00:00:47,641 --> 00:00:48,640
you?
Well what?

21
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:50,520
Well this,
this is the thing that I'm really

22
00:00:50,521 --> 00:00:51,760
comfortable with this,
with,

23
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:53,760
with,
with us just hanging out here talking.

24
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:56,550
Sure.
But this is what I do is I yammer when

25
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:59,640
I'm nervous talker.
So you asked me a question if I'm

26
00:00:59,641 --> 00:01:01,560
nervous.
I just kind of go and go and go and

27
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:02,530
people are like,
Geez

28
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:07,460
man,
that guy talk man.

29
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,820
So the thing is I got this guy sitting
across me,

30
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:14,370
really nice guy and he's The guy who's
coaching me,

31
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:18,450
but I know I'm going to give you like
fake interviews.

32
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,790
Well he probably quote you first.
He gave me.

33
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:24,780
He gave me a lot of really good insights
and the funny thing is every rule that

34
00:01:24,781 --> 00:01:26,880
he's saying as he's saying it,
I'm going,

35
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:27,743
Oh yeah,
I do that.

36
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:29,250
Oh yeah,
like everything he's saying that I

37
00:01:29,251 --> 00:01:30,390
shouldn't be doing.
I'm like,

38
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:31,050
oh yeah,
that's.

39
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:33,450
I always do.
What is he saying you shouldn't be

40
00:01:33,451 --> 00:01:35,580
doing?
I mean that the main thing,

41
00:01:35,581 --> 00:01:38,940
it's Kinda like what we were getting at
before that when somebody setting a trap

42
00:01:38,941 --> 00:01:41,370
for you,
because so much of right now media

43
00:01:41,371 --> 00:01:45,480
training is just about don't go out and
get yourself into trouble by going in

44
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:48,240
and just talking about some ridiculous
area that.

45
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,520
Because that's what people.
That's what everybody's trying to do

46
00:01:50,521 --> 00:01:51,720
now.
Like just as a.

47
00:01:51,721 --> 00:01:55,170
for example,
I did a Time magazine interview about

48
00:01:55,171 --> 00:01:57,930
adoption about a year before we even
made the movie.

49
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:58,913
Really?
Yeah.

50
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:02,850
And it was just because I was in the
process of working on the movie and

51
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,040
anyway,
so the whole thing was just about

52
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:08,010
adoption and my family and whatever.
And it was right when the Harvey

53
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:11,260
Weinstein stuff was blowing up.
So ladies,

54
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:13,590
really nice interview.
And then at the end she says,

55
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:14,191
uh,
hey,

56
00:02:14,191 --> 00:02:16,080
you know,
since I'm talking to a Hollywood

57
00:02:16,081 --> 00:02:18,420
director,
I'd be remiss if I didn't ask did you

58
00:02:18,421 --> 00:02:21,240
know about that Harvey Weinstein stuff?
And I was like,

59
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:24,120
Nah,
I didn't even think about my answer

60
00:02:24,121 --> 00:02:27,210
because I don't know.
I didn't know the guy was never around

61
00:02:27,211 --> 00:02:28,890
any of it.
That's sort of like more like fancy

62
00:02:28,891 --> 00:02:30,060
movies.
And I was like,

63
00:02:30,061 --> 00:02:31,320
yeah,
I know I don't.

64
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:32,790
I don't know.
I never met the guy,

65
00:02:32,791 --> 00:02:34,350
whatever.
I didn't think anything of it.

66
00:02:34,351 --> 00:02:36,210
I got off the phone and then I thought,
oh,

67
00:02:36,211 --> 00:02:38,340
she didn't say,
what do you think about this stuff?

68
00:02:38,341 --> 00:02:40,410
She said,
did you know about that stuff?

69
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:43,140
And it was like.
And I knew,

70
00:02:43,141 --> 00:02:47,550
but I kept it a secret for those people
and I just thought right away,

71
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:50,510
you know,
the limiting factor was just like I was

72
00:02:50,511 --> 00:02:52,940
just getting bored.
I wasn't actually breathing when we're

73
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:55,730
thinking of this is the thing.
I mean,

74
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:57,890
you had to,
at any given time,

75
00:02:57,891 --> 00:03:02,440
any time you had to think of something
that was going to be more powerful than

76
00:03:02,441 --> 00:03:07,030
the thought of stopping or fatigue or
clc get deeper into your skin.

77
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,900
And so sometimes it was really easy
because you were swimming with dolphins,

78
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:14,200
minky whales as one with the basking
shark.

79
00:03:14,201 --> 00:03:16,290
Did they come over to you going,
what the fuck is this dude?

80
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,950
Yeah,
there was,

81
00:03:17,951 --> 00:03:18,390
yeah,
there's a,

82
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:20,010
there was a video of that ages ago with
the,

83
00:03:20,011 --> 00:03:21,130
uh,
the minky well,

84
00:03:21,131 --> 00:03:23,470
and the,
I was filming 12 hours cross the Bristol

85
00:03:23,471 --> 00:03:25,270
channel,
so that's kind of England to Wales.

86
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:26,230
And uh,
this was,

87
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:29,340
this was without doubt for all the
hardship that I've spoke about.

88
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,540
I just want to say there were some
amazing moments.

89
00:03:31,541 --> 00:03:34,110
This one particular moment swimming
across the,

90
00:03:34,111 --> 00:03:36,220
uh,
the Bristol Channel and all of a sudden

91
00:03:36,221 --> 00:03:36,791
minky,
well,

92
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:39,760
kind of about big as this table breaches
right next to me.

93
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:40,594
And I was like,
whoa,

94
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,820
because I tend to map the captain.
I was like,

95
00:03:42,821 --> 00:03:44,800
man,
am I safe?

96
00:03:44,801 --> 00:03:45,670
Like,
what's going on?

97
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:46,541
Should I get out the door?
And he said,

98
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:46,681
no,
no,

99
00:03:46,681 --> 00:03:46,990
no,
no,

100
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:48,130
you're absolutely fine.
And I was like,

101
00:03:48,131 --> 00:03:49,640
okay,
because he's a monkey wildlife that the

102
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:50,441
find the friendly.
I was like,

103
00:03:50,441 --> 00:03:51,274
okay,
fair enough.

104
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:54,070
So I keep swimming and then for the next
five miles,

105
00:03:54,071 --> 00:03:56,760
the minky whales circling me,
it was breaching over the top.

106
00:03:56,761 --> 00:03:58,870
It was coming under me and swimming like
that.

107
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:00,700
I tend to mine.
I said like,

108
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:02,620
now what's going on?
And he said,

109
00:04:02,621 --> 00:04:05,020
I've never seen this.
He's been sailing like 40 years.

110
00:04:05,021 --> 00:04:06,130
He says,
I've never seen this.

111
00:04:06,131 --> 00:04:09,070
He said,
but what I think is happening is I think

112
00:04:09,071 --> 00:04:11,700
it's a female and I try to fuck you.
Well,

113
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:14,640
I said,
it's not mating season.

114
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:15,151
He was like,
no,

115
00:04:15,151 --> 00:04:15,380
no,
no,

116
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:15,811
no,
it's fine.

117
00:04:15,811 --> 00:04:16,391
It's fine.
He goes,

118
00:04:16,391 --> 00:04:21,170
what are these for later?
Have it here.

119
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,630
I mean,
I've seen him for four months in the

120
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:26,680
water.
I'm going to fuck mating seasons

121
00:04:26,681 --> 00:04:28,090
probably right around the corner.
She was like,

122
00:04:28,091 --> 00:04:31,210
if he sticks around to move on.

123
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:36,820
So
that was a concern of mine.

124
00:04:36,821 --> 00:04:38,100
That was a good one.
Yeah.

125
00:04:38,101 --> 00:04:39,420
And it was.
No.

126
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:40,081
Matt said,
no,

127
00:04:40,081 --> 00:04:40,300
no,
no.

128
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:43,210
I think it's a few more.
I think that she thinks that you're an

129
00:04:43,211 --> 00:04:48,211
injured seal and so for the next five
miles she basically guided me all the

130
00:04:48,461 --> 00:04:51,760
way to the shallower water and as I got
there,

131
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:53,860
it was literally the debt for the water.
Matt said,

132
00:04:53,861 --> 00:04:54,520
Yep,
Yep.

133
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:57,370
Much shallower water.
And we turned whale breached one more

134
00:04:57,371 --> 00:04:59,890
time and then.
And then swam off as if to say,

135
00:04:59,891 --> 00:05:00,760
you know,
you're safe now.

136
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:04,920
Well why is there so much pushback
against this thing?

137
00:05:04,921 --> 00:05:08,100
Is that I think what's going on as a
people worry that it doesn't look like a

138
00:05:08,101 --> 00:05:10,660
problem to be solved anymore.
So when you.

139
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:12,960
When our kids,
we both have lots of gay friends,

140
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:15,510
but we didn't know it because they're
not telling anybody because someone's

141
00:05:15,511 --> 00:05:17,490
going to kick their ass if they knew
that they were gay.

142
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,190
Gay people are still discriminated
against,

143
00:05:20,191 --> 00:05:21,960
but it's so much better than it was.
Then.

144
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:24,480
What you don't want to.
What I think people are advocates don't

145
00:05:24,481 --> 00:05:24,961
want to say is,
well,

146
00:05:24,961 --> 00:05:29,010
there's no problem anymore because then
you can allow them to still run into

147
00:05:29,011 --> 00:05:31,620
troubles in various circumstances.
Even though the trouble they run into

148
00:05:31,621 --> 00:05:35,760
today is a thousand times less than the
trouble they ran two and little same

149
00:05:35,761 --> 00:05:38,160
thing holds for racism.
Same thing holds for sexism.

150
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:42,690
They've all gotten so much better,
but and sexual violence is a perfect

151
00:05:42,691 --> 00:05:43,320
example.

152
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,620
If you look at,
if you set,

153
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:48,840
this isn't pinker's book,
if you set rape and homicide to you call

154
00:05:48,841 --> 00:05:51,450
it both of them,
whatever level they are in 1970 to 100

155
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:54,030
and then you track them through to the
early two thousands.

156
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:58,310
Homicide is in the U.
S homicides dropped to like 50 raves

157
00:05:58,311 --> 00:06:01,940
dropped down to like 25,
but if you listen to women's advocacy

158
00:06:01,941 --> 00:06:03,950
groups about campus sexual assault and
stuff,

159
00:06:03,951 --> 00:06:07,440
you'd never know that and the reason you
wouldn't know it is because they.

160
00:06:07,441 --> 00:06:08,600
People worry.
Well,

161
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:10,760
if you think the problem's getting
better on sound,

162
00:06:10,761 --> 00:06:13,010
then you will keep doing anything to
help fix it.

163
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:16,700
And that's a really unfortunate part of
our psychology because it makes people

164
00:06:16,701 --> 00:06:19,640
feel like there's been no progress and
when you feel like there's no progress,

165
00:06:19,641 --> 00:06:21,230
then you think,
well maybe we need to completely

166
00:06:21,231 --> 00:06:23,120
overturn the whole system and try
something new.

167
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,400
And that's of course the point of
pinker's newest book,

168
00:06:25,401 --> 00:06:27,950
enlightened men now.
No things are going freaking great.

169
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,860
Turn it anarchy and all those things are
really bad ideas.

170
00:06:30,861 --> 00:06:33,590
Voting for somebody like trump's a
really bad idea because things are

171
00:06:33,591 --> 00:06:37,010
actually running along really nicely.
It's just that we tend to forget it

172
00:06:37,011 --> 00:06:40,580
because every advocacy group who's all
worried about whatever their particular

173
00:06:40,581 --> 00:06:43,210
issue is,
doesn't want the word to get out that

174
00:06:43,211 --> 00:06:45,290
things are a lot better than they used
to be because I think at some

175
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:46,550
fundamental level they think,
well,

176
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:50,310
25 reps here isn't bad enough.
We better say that there's 100 or you

177
00:06:50,311 --> 00:06:51,740
know,
I'm not saying they do this consciously,

178
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,110
but of course 25 reps here,
whatever the number is,

179
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:55,490
is bad enough.
Right.

180
00:06:55,491 --> 00:06:58,040
It doesn't.
It doesn't have to be the numbers that

181
00:06:58,041 --> 00:07:00,260
it used to be when I was a child to be a
problem at all.

182
00:07:00,261 --> 00:07:01,850
It has to be as a number above zero

183
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:05,790
for my whole apprenticeship.
Alcohol was a reward.

184
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:08,910
You know,
you did a good job tonight.

185
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:10,230
Drink,
you know.

186
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:13,460
Then it went from a reward.
Do.

187
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:16,740
Oh Shit.
There was like a blood bath in the

188
00:07:16,741 --> 00:07:17,551
restaurant.
You know,

189
00:07:17,551 --> 00:07:19,890
we had to pick up this guy at the
hospital.

190
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,330
Okay.
It's not every word.

191
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:23,070
Let's forget about it.
Let's drink,

192
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:24,620
you know.
And it was,

193
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:27,540
it was always there.
You know,

194
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:31,680
it's great service.
Let's have a drink in the food industry,

195
00:07:31,681 --> 00:07:34,410
but you're also in the wine industry
because 50 percent of what you're doing

196
00:07:34,411 --> 00:07:37,020
is selling food to people and the other
50 percent of what you're doing is

197
00:07:37,021 --> 00:07:40,500
selling alcohol at the people,
so by default you're part of the people

198
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:45,530
that sell a liquid drug dealer in that
you're in that world every day and you

199
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:49,160
go to wine tastings.
You'd talk with peoples that sell the

200
00:07:49,161 --> 00:07:50,430
alcohol,
alcoholic bartenders.

201
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:54,350
You talked to people that sell wine,
you or partake in eating and other your

202
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,190
colleagues,
restaurants and drinking wine.

203
00:07:56,191 --> 00:07:58,120
Next thing you know,
you have a little bit of celebrity.

204
00:07:58,121 --> 00:08:03,121
You've been open for 15 years and you
look back and you go to seven days in a

205
00:08:04,411 --> 00:08:09,411
week or seven days in a week and
I drank six of them.

206
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:13,710
I'll feel good on Sunday.
I'm just kind of recovering.

207
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:17,040
And then what?
What happens is one week turns into two

208
00:08:17,041 --> 00:08:22,041
to four and then you kind of look back
and you realize in 2017 that you may

209
00:08:22,651 --> 00:08:27,651
have drank 48 weeks out of 52,
you know,

210
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:34,540
and then it goes quick.
Then it's 10 years and your tenure

211
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:39,560
restaurant and you've been drinking five
days out of the week for 10 years and

212
00:08:40,981 --> 00:08:42,480
then all of a sudden you kind of have a
problem.

213
00:08:42,481 --> 00:08:47,481
You realize that like my day to day is
based on food and wine.

214
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,010
Right now.
I don't want my,

215
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,800
it's not making me happy.
I've had all the wines have had all the

216
00:08:52,801 --> 00:08:54,960
foods.
My,

217
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:56,430
am I better for it?
Not really.

218
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:00,060
What am I better for?
Restriction eating less.

219
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:02,040
Eating clean.
Uh,

220
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:05,830
drinking only on very special occasions.
Do you still drink on special?

221
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:07,360
I don't want.
I'm completely sober.

222
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:07,750
No,

223
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:11,300
you see them and I've even seen them
switched teams and you see them switch

224
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:14,500
teams and I don't buy the
rationalizations when it comes to

225
00:09:14,501 --> 00:09:16,240
ideology,
but I think is what they're doing is

226
00:09:16,241 --> 00:09:19,870
they're switching teams because they
realize there's an end on this team and

227
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:21,760
they could just say this is the problem
with the team.

228
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:24,130
I used to be on those fucking losers and
they're,

229
00:09:24,131 --> 00:09:25,950
they're really benedict arnold.
Right?

230
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:31,220
Like like they probably have as much of
an affinity to the ideas of one side is

231
00:09:31,591 --> 00:09:34,900
a do the other side.
They just go all in on one side to get

232
00:09:34,901 --> 00:09:37,150
acceptance from the group.
You just no way.

233
00:09:37,151 --> 00:09:40,480
People change their opinion that much
over two years or something like that.

234
00:09:40,481 --> 00:09:42,940
Or you know,
it's like they just decide this group

235
00:09:42,941 --> 00:09:46,090
makes more sense now and I've been
attacked by people on the left so I'm

236
00:09:46,091 --> 00:09:47,560
going to go to the right or vice verse.

237
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:50,950
And usually what it is,
is even when they say they've been

238
00:09:50,951 --> 00:09:51,521
attacked,
like,

239
00:09:51,521 --> 00:09:55,420
oh you fucking baby,
there's 300 million people just in this

240
00:09:55,421 --> 00:09:58,480
country alone.
If you put something out there publicly

241
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:01,240
and a thousand people attack,
you don't act like you're being

242
00:10:01,241 --> 00:10:02,200
persecuted.
Okay.

243
00:10:02,201 --> 00:10:03,580
You have an idea.
You've,

244
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:06,400
you've,
you've launched that idea out into the

245
00:10:06,401 --> 00:10:08,710
Zeit geist and people took a big shit on
it.

246
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:10,510
You know,
whether it's people on the right are

247
00:10:10,511 --> 00:10:12,400
people on the left.
You've got to be able to argue your

248
00:10:12,401 --> 00:10:16,300
point one way or the other and not just
immediately jumped ship when someone who

249
00:10:16,301 --> 00:10:21,301
shares ideas with you decides that your
idea sucks and maybe they're wrong and

250
00:10:21,551 --> 00:10:24,160
maybe you're right,
but you've got to argue that through,

251
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:29,250
but this idea of these partisan patterns
that people just seem to automatically

252
00:10:30,251 --> 00:10:33,430
fall into.
There's so detrimental to dialogue

253
00:10:33,431 --> 00:10:35,230
there,
so detrimental to us and really

254
00:10:35,231 --> 00:10:38,650
understanding each other and really
having some sort of a sense of

255
00:10:38,651 --> 00:10:39,280
community.

256
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:42,130
Right?
This is a giant community of 300 million

257
00:10:42,131 --> 00:10:44,170
people.
That's what it's supposed to be and this

258
00:10:44,171 --> 00:10:47,530
idea that it's this group is trying to
fuck it up and they're trying to turn us

259
00:10:47,531 --> 00:10:51,340
all Muslims and this one wants everybody
to be gay and this one wants everybody

260
00:10:51,341 --> 00:10:54,460
to have free food and this and this.
This is nonsense.

261
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:58,170
This is nonsense.
We need better understanding and,

262
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:01,060
and you know the word better.
Education gets tossed around a lot,

263
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:03,730
but it also means better social
understanding,

264
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:08,020
better social education,
like got an appreciation of who we are

265
00:11:08,021 --> 00:11:12,760
and why we think the way we think and
calling out weasels on both sides of the

266
00:11:12,761 --> 00:11:15,760
pattern,
like calling out weasels on the right

267
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:18,930
that are pandering,
that are just trying to like get the

268
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:22,240
repeating a lot of these like accepted
beliefs because they know that they can

269
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:25,990
hit this frequency and a lot of people
sing along or the same thing that other

270
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,780
people are doing on the left.
They're doing it on both sides.

271
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:33,960
I think most reasonable people have a
collection of ideas that they share from

272
00:11:34,211 --> 00:11:38,500
both the right and the left and most
reasonable people are reasonably

273
00:11:38,501 --> 00:11:41,830
compassionate and I think that's one of
the things that we're missing.

274
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,800
But uh,
yeah,

275
00:11:43,801 --> 00:11:47,700
most places they have them and they're
managed and you go out and buy the small

276
00:11:47,701 --> 00:11:50,580
game license for 12 bucks or whatever.
Get your hunter safety,

277
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:56,030
get yourself a 22 or a shotgun and you
can become a squirrel man or a squirrel

278
00:11:56,681 --> 00:12:00,850
lady like your Buddy Kevin Murphy list.
One of my favorite guys on your podcast.

279
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:05,080
He's a squirrel man.
This guy blows a horn in the woods

280
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:08,470
before every hunt to alert the animals
that he's coming.

281
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:10,910
Yeah.
You blow up?

282
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:12,550
Yeah.
He carries a cow horn around.

283
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:14,710
I think the,
I think,

284
00:12:14,711 --> 00:12:16,300
um,
it's in,

285
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:18,790
uh,
a show far.

286
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:22,420
Right.
Is that right for you when you blow the

287
00:12:22,421 --> 00:12:25,360
Shofar and like a Jewish synagogue?
Is that what it is?

288
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,700
I think it's called a show far like
you've blown the rams.

289
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,260
They blow a Ram's horn.
It's not,

290
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:30,130
it's not a cow.
Yeah.

291
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:32,560
It's not a cow harm.
It's ran her near the end of,

292
00:12:32,561 --> 00:12:34,240
um,
you know,

293
00:12:34,241 --> 00:12:36,600
in the end have no country for old men.
Yeah.

294
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:42,940
Have we talked about this before?
He talks about his father riding out

295
00:12:42,941 --> 00:12:47,790
ahead of him with a Horn of fire.
In the end when you get,

296
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,080
he relates the dream.
It's in the book and it's in the movie

297
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:53,590
for the Tommy Lee Jones characters
describing a dream in which they're

298
00:12:53,591 --> 00:12:57,100
riding through a snowstorm and his
father rides ahead with a Horn of fire.

299
00:12:57,460 --> 00:13:02,460
And I was wondering how many people
heard that and had no idea what he was

300
00:13:02,531 --> 00:13:06,040
talking about,
but what a common practice used to be as

301
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:09,100
you take a horn buffalo horn,
cow horn,

302
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:11,050
and it's hollow because,
um,

303
00:13:11,051 --> 00:13:14,830
it grows off of protrusion of the skull,
called the horn core.

304
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:16,930
Then you pop the horn off and it's
hollow.

305
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,690
And what people will do is when you left
your campfire in the morning,

306
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:23,680
you would fill that horn with embers and
cap it,

307
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:27,130
but there'd be a little pinhole in it
just to let a little bit of air and air

308
00:13:27,131 --> 00:13:30,640
so could continue to smolder.
And you carry that Horn all day full of

309
00:13:30,641 --> 00:13:33,400
embers.
And at night to start a new fire,

310
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:36,520
you would dump the horn out and rekindle
your fire.

311
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:40,420
So when he talks about his father riding
out ahead of them with a Horn of fire,

312
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:45,280
what that's meant to say is that he knew
his father will be waiting out ahead of

313
00:13:45,281 --> 00:13:49,060
him with a fire burning.
Oh yeah.

314
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:51,820
But Kevin Murphy just blows it.
Let squirrels noise coming.
