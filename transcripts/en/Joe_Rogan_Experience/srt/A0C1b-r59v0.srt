1
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:05,040
Woof, woof, woof. And now
the fuck you doing man,

2
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:07,950
you're ruining the whole program.

3
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:12,150
The Joe Rogan experience is brought
to you by a bunch of different shit.

4
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:14,970
We've got a new sponsor, it's
called Ting. And what teaching is,

5
00:00:14,971 --> 00:00:19,110
is a cellular company, a cell phone
company that they buy time on sprint.

6
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:23,670
They allow you to get great cell phones
on a great service with no contracts.

7
00:00:23,671 --> 00:00:24,720
You don't have to,
uh,

8
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:29,220
pay any cancellation fees if you
only use a certain amount of minutes,

9
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,940
those minutes roll over to the next month.
So you only pay for what you use.

10
00:00:32,941 --> 00:00:36,660
They have a whole tiered system.
It's a real simple, real easy.

11
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,330
And if you go to rogan.ting.com,

12
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,570
you could save 50 bucks off
of any of the new phones,

13
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:46,290
including the Samsung Galaxy s three.
That's the newest shit that they got.

14
00:00:46,291 --> 00:00:50,480
That's pretty fucking bad ass.
It's a, uh, a huge ass phone. Uh,

15
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,560
I can't tell you that
much about the sprint,

16
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:56,010
the sprint service to be honest because a,

17
00:00:56,011 --> 00:01:00,510
I just started using it but the phone
itself as slick as fuck the a galaxy s

18
00:01:00,511 --> 00:01:00,751
three,

19
00:01:00,751 --> 00:01:05,751
I had a used to have a droid and Brian
had the same thing that droid to shit.

20
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:10,470
It's way better now. Yeah, the droid
two's a hunk of shit. It's terrible.

21
00:01:10,471 --> 00:01:13,500
But the Samsung Galaxy
s three is bad as fuck.

22
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,150
Go to rogan.ting.com and get yourself 50,
50 bucks off your dirty bitches.

23
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:20,430
Jealous of that. Actually
I get you on, you know,

24
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:22,710
you know how you had that
problem with Doug Benson?

25
00:01:22,711 --> 00:01:24,810
Like you text him and he never got it.
Yeah,

26
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:28,710
I saw that happened two more times since
then and I saw it happened again last

27
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:32,460
night where like I sent text messages to
Brody and he never got it. Listen son,

28
00:01:32,461 --> 00:01:32,930
your on and off.

29
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:37,600
Yeah I lost you. Are you know you're on
an FBI list? No, you are. We got freeway,

30
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:40,010
motherfucking Ricky Ross on the podcast.

31
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:43,610
You don't think you're all your cell phone
text messages. It can be intercepted.

32
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:47,480
Listen son, we've been ever since
Michael Roper was on this motherfucker,

33
00:01:47,481 --> 00:01:48,660
we've run into lockdown.

34
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:52,280
That's why you shit's missing some
some FBI dude's wagon off to Europe.

35
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:56,500
You're dick pictures going to be worse
now it's gonna be worse down. Goddammit.

36
00:01:56,810 --> 00:02:00,500
We're also brought to you by
[inaudible] Dot Com oh and and it,

37
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:02,660
we have new shit in hemp force.

38
00:02:02,661 --> 00:02:07,661
It's a delicious new protein powder that
is made with Makkah and raw cocoa and

39
00:02:08,181 --> 00:02:13,181
it's fucking sensational and it's easily
the best and most digestible protein.

40
00:02:14,181 --> 00:02:17,360
You won't get nearly the kind of gas
that you get if you fuck around with that

41
00:02:17,361 --> 00:02:21,050
way. Shit like muscle milk, it tastes good
but you'll fucking stick up the joint.

42
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:24,320
This is different.
We also have battle ropes and kettlebells.

43
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:27,890
The new wave of functional
fitness is a battle.

44
00:02:27,891 --> 00:02:31,430
Ropes and kettlebells are a big part of
it and what they are is you're a using

45
00:02:31,431 --> 00:02:34,250
exercise equipment that makes you
use your whole body in one motion.

46
00:02:34,251 --> 00:02:37,400
Instead of doing things like curls
and like isolation exercises,

47
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:42,020
which don't necessarily apply to athletic
endeavors. Instead of doing that,

48
00:02:42,021 --> 00:02:44,690
you're doing things like kettle bells,
which is like this bowling ball.

49
00:02:44,691 --> 00:02:46,400
It's on a handle on your
swinging him around.

50
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:49,880
And what it does is it forces your
body to you to move as one unit.

51
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:53,510
And so you get strong and actually
move and shit around as opposed to just

52
00:02:53,511 --> 00:02:56,540
getting like a good bench press.
You know what I'm saying? So, uh,

53
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:00,250
it's all interesting stuff. If you're
interested in it, go to.com, check it out.

54
00:03:00,251 --> 00:03:04,450
If you use the code name Rogan, you
will get 10% off any an all supplements.

55
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:06,550
Also the for,
for the supplements,

56
00:03:06,551 --> 00:03:11,510
especially the controversial ones
like Alpha brain free freeway, Ricky,

57
00:03:11,511 --> 00:03:15,010
you will not test positive
suddenly gives you one of these.

58
00:03:15,011 --> 00:03:17,710
You will not be in trouble.
Those are all uh,

59
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:21,100
this is all shit that your
body is just normal nutrients.

60
00:03:21,101 --> 00:03:24,820
It's just high levels of
refined nutrients. Uh,

61
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:27,610
there's a hundred percent money back
guarantee and the first 30 pills or these

62
00:03:27,611 --> 00:03:31,180
things if you, if you try him. And he
said, this is bullshit. And by the way,

63
00:03:31,181 --> 00:03:33,640
I have friends that say it's bullshit.
I'm going to be honest with you.

64
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:38,020
I have people that I know very well.
They try it. They don't like it for me.

65
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:41,950
It's fucking elixir for me.
It's God's gift for Duncan Trussell's.

66
00:03:41,951 --> 00:03:44,280
God's give Joey Diaz raves about it.
Um,

67
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:46,630
Lorenza Fertittas completely
addicted to this stuff,

68
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:49,060
but Brian doesn't even like it.
It doesn't even work on him.

69
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:53,450
Oh, I, I just, I don't see like it's for
a while I thought it was doing something,

70
00:03:53,451 --> 00:03:57,260
but then I got off it and I was like,
wait, I feel the same and I don't know.

71
00:03:57,410 --> 00:04:01,310
I think if you were on it, you shouldn't,
you be like more, I don't know.

72
00:04:01,311 --> 00:04:05,540
For me it might be too retarded print.
Yeah. It might be just to pass that.

73
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:05,770
It might

74
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:09,760
be too retarded for Alpha brain, but
for me it's the shits, the new mood.

75
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:12,640
I'm all about the new bed. New Mood
is fantastic. Would new mood is,

76
00:04:12,641 --> 00:04:17,641
it's a five HTP and l tryptofan a
supplement and five HTP helps your brain

77
00:04:17,801 --> 00:04:22,510
produce serotonin and that actually
makes you feel happy or five HTP has long

78
00:04:22,511 --> 00:04:26,110
been used as an antidepressant by a
lot of people. You take that five HTP,

79
00:04:26,111 --> 00:04:28,720
you brain produces more serotonin,
which by the way, as you get older,

80
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,130
it just fucking slows down.

81
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,430
It's just you can either deal with it
and deal with this new level of feeling

82
00:04:33,431 --> 00:04:36,280
that you have or you can supplement
and that's what I'm all about, man.

83
00:04:36,281 --> 00:04:39,490
I'm all about taking the shit that makes
me feel the best. It's the most healthy.

84
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,760
That's why I'm down with Alpha
brain and dirty fucks. All right.

85
00:04:42,761 --> 00:04:46,840
We are also brought to you by death
squad. Dot. TV. [inaudible] dot.

86
00:04:46,841 --> 00:04:51,080
TV is the the website for
all of Brian's podcasts.

87
00:04:51,081 --> 00:04:54,010
We've you see the website.
If you see death squad podcasts,

88
00:04:54,011 --> 00:04:55,630
anything has desk over
that crazy cat on it.

89
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:59,770
That's all Brian's shit

a cat tee shirts. You go back.

91
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:06,580
Do you still buy the first one? No,
only one kit. That first one back sign,

92
00:05:06,581 --> 00:05:08,950
it was a keeper. That's a whole thing.
It's like a collector's edition.

93
00:05:08,951 --> 00:05:10,240
So once they sell out,
they're gone forever.

94
00:05:10,241 --> 00:05:13,270
I need that cat in the second one
that can and the second one is evil.

95
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:17,140
That has to be on something
like we should, we should
make an actual sculpture.

96
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:21,190
Oh by the way, whoever sent
me that fucking Werewolf
having sex with the gorilla.

97
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:25,360
You're a bad motherfucker. I told a
story about a crazy dream that I had.

98
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:28,750
I told a story on the show, but I
should save this for after the podcast.

99
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:32,140
Go to desk squad.tv. There's two
different tee shirts that are Ville.

100
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:34,750
There's only one now. Alpha
brain, the new one, the new ones,

101
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:36,550
the better ones and new ones,
the better one anyway,

102
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:41,580
but you can also go to [inaudible] dot
com and you can donate to Brian through

103
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:45,250
amazon.com and what this does is like say
if you want to buy something on Amazon

104
00:05:45,251 --> 00:05:50,140
anyway, if you go through Brian's website,
they'll give him a kickback. So G, G,

105
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:52,060

106
00:05:52,061 --> 00:05:55,240
So there's all different ways that
you can help out the show and for me,

107
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:58,730
I just want you to be you. Oh, all right.

108
00:05:58,731 --> 00:06:00,830
That's all I want out of your dirty fucks.
All right.

109
00:06:00,831 --> 00:06:04,490
We got a hell of a show tomorrow night
at the Lobero Theater in Santa Barbara,

110
00:06:04,491 --> 00:06:06,800
California,
Joe Diaz and Duncan Trussell.

111
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:09,800
But right now if we re Ricky
is in the fucking house,

112
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,500
we're going to get down to business,
hit the music,

113
00:06:12,501 --> 00:06:17,501
Sun Joe Rogan experience Joe
Rogan podcast by night all day.

114
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:26,693
No

115
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:32,360
rarely in life does it become more
evident to me that we are on the wrong

116
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:35,850
fucking track as a culture.

117
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:41,150
Then when I pick up rolling stone and
rolling stone used to have hunters

118
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:46,530
Thompson writing stories about taking
acid in Vegas and they were spectacular.

119
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:50,790
I mean today they still have Matt Taibbi
who breaks down all the reality behind

120
00:06:50,791 --> 00:06:51,870
the financial crisis,

121
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:57,020
but rolling stone has a guy on it who's
really fat and he's covered in tattoos

122
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,710
and he's got your name.
Yeah.

123
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:06,270
This is the craziest Shit I've ever
seen in my life as a human cause this at

124
00:07:06,271 --> 00:07:11,220
this point is like, we are weird man.
We are a weird fucking species. Yeah.

125
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,400
There's nothing weird.
Or then like as if he,

126
00:07:14,401 --> 00:07:16,410
if he hadn't called himself Rick Ross,

127
00:07:16,411 --> 00:07:20,610
this shit would've never
happened for him as if, I mean,

128
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,920
what kind of faith does
that have in your town?

129
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,500
He could change his name right now.
He could change this right now,

130
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,020
his name right now to something
else and be just as huge. I mean,

131
00:07:28,021 --> 00:07:32,670
how many times is puff daddy changes? Name
P, diddy none. And now he's just diddy,

132
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,170
you know,
think about that.

133
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,830
Well, you know, but his whole image
is based on the name. You know, he,

134
00:07:37,831 --> 00:07:42,050
he's built his whole career
around this name and, uh, he,

135
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:43,170
he's afraid to change it.

136
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:47,400
That's a thing that some dudes do. Like
they'll call themselves Capone, you know,

137
00:07:47,401 --> 00:07:50,670
they'll call themselves something
fucked up that's like, you know, I'm my,

138
00:07:50,671 --> 00:07:52,830
I'm Tony Montana motherfucker.
They'll crawl,

139
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:56,730
call themselves somebody who actually
was a bad motherfucker. Yeah.

140
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:01,220
So when people don't know people
that aren't from my generation, um,

141
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:06,300
what they don't know is that during this
whole Iran contra thing that was going

142
00:08:06,301 --> 00:08:09,900
on, when it became revealed
that Oliver North, that they,

143
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:12,350
they were selling illegal
guns and they there,

144
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:17,360
there was some drug dealing in the CIA
and the in the hood that was like wow.

145
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:20,970
Did Not admitted it was,
it was crazy times.

146
00:08:20,971 --> 00:08:25,420
But my point is you became a prominent
fig on the news. There was a,

147
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:30,440
it was a big high profile case and before
you went to jail it was very evident

148
00:08:31,081 --> 00:08:32,970
who you were.
I mean it was a big case.

149
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:37,870
Yeah, it was. It was a, an la times
once put me on as the Walmart.

150
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:40,420
A crack cocaine.
I think that's what he said though.

151
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:46,300
Hey Joe w freeways, friend. What is
your name again? Brother? His attorney.

152
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:51,180
Yeah. I had told him until I got to ride
with attorney now, hey, pull me over mark.

153
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:54,990
And from the old way you, you got the
perfect get though. He's young. Cool.

154
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:56,160
Know you lucked out.

155
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:56,310
Yeah.

156
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:59,710
Joe, we got to remember,
what year was it? 1996 right.

157
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:03,810
The guy says that he came up with
the name of [inaudible] 96. So in 96,

158
00:09:03,811 --> 00:09:04,800
Rick's name is everywhere.

159
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:08,520
I'll tell him I'll globally
cspan congressional hearings.
And then the guy says,

160
00:09:08,521 --> 00:09:10,160
I imagine it up in 96.

161
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:11,600
That's what he said. He, uh,

162
00:09:11,601 --> 00:09:16,370
he has some cockamamie name
was a cockamamie description
for why he changed the

163
00:09:16,371 --> 00:09:19,130
name. But the bottom line is you had
the name first and you were famous.

164
00:09:19,131 --> 00:09:21,920
So it seems like he would have
to change it if he's going to,

165
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:25,040
it's not his real name. So he's gonna
change his name to something else.

166
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:28,370
Why would he change it into the name
of a dude who was already famous?

167
00:09:28,371 --> 00:09:29,390
Who's like, I mean, if he's,

168
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:33,320
if he's pretending that it changed
it for some arbitrary reason,

169
00:09:33,321 --> 00:09:36,790
like someone said something and I said,
I'm no, I'm Rick Ross, the boss, you know,

170
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:40,340
like, oh, you didn't know those records.
That's like calling yourself, you know,

171
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,600
I'm going to be Mitt Romney.

172
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:42,140
And he said,

173
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:47,140
I'll profess a philosopher
of gang and drug culture.

174
00:09:47,331 --> 00:09:51,890
You know, he says that he knows all the
drug dealers and all the gang bangers in,

175
00:09:51,891 --> 00:09:54,590
in, in the whole, you know, the
whole nature of the business.

176
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:58,190
Yeah. That's another sticky point. He
didn't know, but he didn't know about,

177
00:09:58,191 --> 00:10:01,670
you know about me. That's crazy. Yeah.

178
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:05,690
Noriega Pablo Escobar.
Yeah. There was no one,

179
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:08,570
there was no Wikipedia in 96 unfortunately
though. Right. That's when he,

180
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:10,340
when did he start becoming famous for it?

181
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:14,910
The name Oh seven oh seven yeah.
Yeah.

182
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:18,280
See that's when we started to slide.
We started falling apart last year.

183
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:21,830
The Bush administration, but the
fuckers are losing hope. They'll like,

184
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:24,290
this doesn't even make sense. He's
like, fuck it, this can't last.

185
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:27,330
I'm just going to call
myself Rick Ross and boom,

186
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:32,060
cover of rolling stone kid.
That's weird. It's rolling stone.

187
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:34,200
Good story in there. You know, they can't,

188
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:36,920
they won't write a story about
you and they never wrote about me.

189
00:10:36,921 --> 00:10:40,520
I used to write rolling stone when I was
in prison and tried to get them to do a

190
00:10:40,521 --> 00:10:44,400
story about the drug war and what
was going on in the whole holding on.

191
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:49,200
But it's so crazy, you know?
It's like they don't like me,

192
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:54,260
but he can go on with my name because my
story and wrap on Monday night football

193
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:56,580
about selling drugs.

194
00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:01,140
Did he wrap up Monday night
football? Really? What did he do?

195
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:04,870
He did try off it with a
Mariah Carey. Wow. And disease.

196
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,020
Talk about selling drugs in that song.

197
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:10,030
I mean that's all he talks about it.
I didn't hear him do the song,

198
00:11:10,031 --> 00:11:12,700
but I mean everything that
he raps about these drugs.

199
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:15,440
Really. That's it. What's,

200
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:18,250
what people don't know is he used to
be a corrections officer like this.

201
00:11:18,251 --> 00:11:20,150
The story gets crazier and crazier.

202
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:22,130
He's like a character
in a will Ferrell movie.

203
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:27,410
He's like some nutty dude
that gets exposed that has
been putting on this like,

204
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:31,300
it's not like he's putting on a hustle
in 1980 when you had to go to the library

205
00:11:31,301 --> 00:11:35,210
to find out about people.
You tend to put a hustle a lot in a diff.

206
00:11:35,211 --> 00:11:38,330
This is a different time, man.
You can't do that anymore. Yeah.

207
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:42,140
Where do you know our people
were so I don't know man. So,

208
00:11:42,141 --> 00:11:46,130
so lost that it doesn't matter anymore.
You know,

209
00:11:46,131 --> 00:11:49,000
you can come up and tell them
anything and they go forward.

210
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:53,230
And then once they discovered that they'd
been lied to, they still, you know,

211
00:11:53,231 --> 00:11:55,670
kind of like just Mosey riding on a loan.

212
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:58,410
No, Rick, tell him how he
said he came up with the hike.

213
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,530
How you decided to be a correction
officer in rolling stone?

214
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:03,280
They called the big boss. No, no, no, no.

215
00:12:03,281 --> 00:12:07,210
I heard that in the article itself that
you have in front of, he says that, uh,

216
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:10,380
he was eating peanut butter and
jelly sandwiches with his friend.

217
00:12:10,381 --> 00:12:14,570
His friend got caught for selling dope
and the prince father just tells him to

218
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:18,780
be, as frank goes away, it goes away
and the father walks up to him. He says,

219
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:21,570
you need to get a job,
become a correction officer.

220
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:25,580
Yeah. Did you just explain this to
me? Like really recently told me this?

221
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:27,850
Uh, no, they was in the rolling stone.

222
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:29,790
Right. But didn't you explain
it to me recently too?

223
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:34,630
When was the last time I talked to you
before this came out? Yeah, ridiculous.

224
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:36,550
Cause I kinda remember that statement.

225
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:39,960
I mean you think about it and then you
think about it from the level of your son

226
00:12:39,961 --> 00:12:44,480
just got, got arrested for, for
cocaine sales as far as 20 years.

227
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:47,910
First thing you're gonna say is to
his friend is go be as a prison guard.

228
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:52,540
Jesus Christ. Give him in jail. But
you know, they've done those studies.

229
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:55,140
They did a study, I think it
was at Stanford where they, uh,

230
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:59,680
did a prison guard study where they had
students pretend to be prisoners and

231
00:12:59,681 --> 00:13:03,520
prison guards. And like almost immediately
the prison guards became abusive,

232
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:06,340
fake study kids,
just kids.

233
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:10,510
I worked as a security guard
at great woods. It was like a,

234
00:13:10,511 --> 00:13:14,350
a performance arts place in Mansfield,
Massachusetts.

235
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,330
It was like outside of Boston.
It was like,

236
00:13:16,331 --> 00:13:19,880
while the big conscience would come there,
like Bon Jovi and shit. And, and uh,

237
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:23,510
I was a security guard there and I'm
not a big dude, you know. And so, uh,

238
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:27,060
I was like, someone's going to fuck
me up. This is ridiculous. You know,

239
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:30,550
being in a position of security, well,
I'm being, I'm just a security guard.

240
00:13:30,551 --> 00:13:32,290
At a concert place,
but I swear to God,

241
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:34,900
within a couple of
months of working there,

242
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:39,730
you develop this us versus them mentality.
You deal with enough drunk and people,

243
00:13:39,731 --> 00:13:42,850
enough craziness.
That dude's we're hitting dudes,

244
00:13:42,851 --> 00:13:46,030
that guys who I'd never thought would
hit somebody. We're hitting people.

245
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:49,620
I wish that authority, that authority
over somebody and you feel that,

246
00:13:49,621 --> 00:13:51,150
that you have

247
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:57,780
a whole system behind you and that you're
writing, you can't do wrong. You know,

248
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:58,620
matter of fact,

249
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:03,620
a guy that was in custody while he was a
guard had called me one day and told me

250
00:14:04,831 --> 00:14:07,320
that this guy was one of the worst
cards that you could be. You know,

251
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:12,400
if you had an extra soup, he would take it
from you. Uh, extra stamp, you know. Oh,

252
00:14:12,401 --> 00:14:13,500
you one stamp over.

253
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:15,410
Oh No.

254
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:19,860
Right into the sort of general, well, he
had an extra stamp. You know, like what?

255
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:24,090
I want to get a bunch of guys. You
know what? Whenever I get a chance,

256
00:14:24,091 --> 00:14:26,580
I want to get a bunch of guys that was
in jail with him and just get their

257
00:14:26,581 --> 00:14:28,290
stories and see

258
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:30,131
irony of it all.

259
00:14:30,131 --> 00:14:33,760
Is it that you sit there and you watch
it like the bet awards and he hollered

260
00:14:33,761 --> 00:14:36,970
out for all my guys locked up in,
Oh my God.

261
00:14:36,971 --> 00:14:41,320
All the people that I used to tell the
shut the phone and then the guys in

262
00:14:41,321 --> 00:14:43,480
prison are cried. I mean,
you got stopped that guy.

263
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,000
Why are you guys letting him do that?

264
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,180
Matter of fact,

265
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:52,180
I was with somebody a couple days ago
and they were saying that this guy that

266
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:56,510
he's been rapping about in his songs,
it's in prison. It's like, man,

267
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:58,370
the guy messed my appeal up.
You know,

268
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:01,550
I was on appeal and he got
it on the record and told
them everything that I did.

269
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:05,290
Oh, no way. Oh my God.

270
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:08,670
He told his story through rapping
what an asshole. Yeah. And,

271
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:12,640
and even Rick Ross knows what he did.
He fucked up his appeal.

272
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:14,830
That's ridiculous.

273
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:16,720
Uh, the, the,

274
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:20,700
he did a documentary on the guys in Miami
that was supposed to been drug dealers

275
00:15:20,701 --> 00:15:23,610
and you know, in some of those guys are
like, man, he should have never did that.

276
00:15:23,611 --> 00:15:25,830
He never got our permission.
He never asked us.

277
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:30,300
Wow. And now those guys are
exposed, exposed. Did you hear that?

278
00:15:30,301 --> 00:15:35,070
Griselda Blanco, uh, got assassinated
the other day. Yeah, I heard that.

279
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:39,300
You know who she is, Huh? Of course
it's business business. He knows,

280
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:45,100
you know who all the key players Brazelle
the Blanco was the old lady in cocaine

281
00:15:46,171 --> 00:15:49,680
cowboys that fucking, oh, you
weren't with me in Florida.

282
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:53,940
Billy Corbin, the guys at director
ever came and came to one of shows.

283
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:55,650
It's fucking cool guy.

284
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:59,090
Famous. She stayed alive. So
you know, after uh, you know,

285
00:15:59,091 --> 00:16:01,220
going to war with Carlos Escobar and

286
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,310
she killed everybody,

287
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:05,880
that chick is responsible for the
deaths of who knows how many people,

288
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:07,860
but they eventually got her somewhere.

289
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:09,620
Well, you know, that's what
happens though when, when,

290
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:14,280
when you start that black market on,
on, on drugs or with anything, you know,

291
00:16:14,281 --> 00:16:15,450
you give that,
that,

292
00:16:15,451 --> 00:16:20,340
that power and the ability
to make so much money that,

293
00:16:20,341 --> 00:16:23,910
that it just corrupts people and you know,
from all walks of life,

294
00:16:23,911 --> 00:16:26,100
I don't think nobody's immune to it.

295
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:30,320
It does not work the same way with fame
like this. I mean it's, it's very similar.

296
00:16:30,321 --> 00:16:34,130
Like what's happening to him.
Yeah. I mean that's very,

297
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,930
that's very corrupting as well,
right?

298
00:16:35,931 --> 00:16:39,530
It would make you bullshit your way
through a story in order to keep your,

299
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:40,750
your money coming in.

300
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:44,830
We do a lot of research for this case and
I actually read an interesting article

301
00:16:44,831 --> 00:16:48,030
by a sister. It was, it was an
interview with the system and he said,

302
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:51,830
she said he's lost in, in,
in this, in this image last.

303
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,593
Wow.

304
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:58,370
Yes. I mean, even when we,
uh, that's crazy. We went,

305
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:01,760
we took his deposition down in Miami was
the first time that me and him was face

306
00:17:01,761 --> 00:17:05,570
to face in a room together.
I mean, he rode his eyes,

307
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,490
he gave me a finger,

308
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:10,480
it gave me the finger.
How long ago was this? Um,

309
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:13,290
and it's about four or five months
ago at least. Is Ridiculous.

310
00:17:13,291 --> 00:17:17,180
So it's after you did this podcast?
Yeah. Yeah. It was after we did podcasts.

311
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:21,570
He gave you the finger. What does he
12 good fuck. Give someone the finger.

312
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:25,670
Have you ever done that? Like fuck
you man, Yo time. You do this in your,

313
00:17:25,671 --> 00:17:27,240
in your car and you got to go

314
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:32,550
decreased shine. Who's like a
little five foot four white woman.

315
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:37,550
It's like who did he go
after? MTV. The host.

316
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:39,940
What happened? He said something
like about Rick Ross and then she,

317
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:43,460
he was claiming that he was going to
be filing against her and this lately,

318
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:44,760
but when the kingpins in the room.
Right.

319
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:50,090
Wow. Give you the finger
though, Huh? Yeah. That

320
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:53,850
alone is a victory when a grown man looks
at you and you don't say shit to him

321
00:17:53,851 --> 00:17:57,060
and he has to give you the finger,
like come on. You silly bitch.

322
00:17:57,250 --> 00:18:01,450
Yeah, but he's such a, I don't know,
you know his album flop this time,

323
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:05,200
did it, but he's on the cover of rolling
stone. Would, I don't think you can.

324
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:09,790
You can, you can have a flap the album
and still going to cover rollers. If, if,

325
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:13,870
uh, I'm going to call my agent. If you
buy it, if you buy, if you bought a cover,

326
00:18:13,871 --> 00:18:16,300
I think all this stuff, you
buy it. I think you buy it now.

327
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:20,190
It's not about being good or uh,

328
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:25,990
you know, uh, being successful, you
know, it's about, can you pay for it now?

329
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:29,370
It's amazing that today in 2012,
this,

330
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:34,610
this image that he's projecting of his
underwear and then his pants like halfway

331
00:18:36,511 --> 00:18:41,370
buckle, halfway down his underwear
was big fat belly hanging out.

332
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,610
Like what are we doing in
2012 were fucking crazy.

333
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:45,451
Yeah.
It's funny.

334
00:18:45,451 --> 00:18:48,450
It's funny Rick talking about robbed and
stolen cause it's been magazine did an

335
00:18:48,451 --> 00:18:50,370
article on Rick that was,
I mean Rick Freeway,

336
00:18:50,371 --> 00:18:54,180
Rick that was on the cover all week,
this weekend spend, did this, you know,

337
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:55,830
he was on the cover.
It's a great magazine.

338
00:18:55,831 --> 00:18:57,180
There's some great expos stays in there.

339
00:18:57,390 --> 00:19:00,570
And they did a piece on the rapper
called master of his own reality.

340
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:02,940
He talked about how he's creepy,

341
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,660
he's taking the criminal black man
image and just perpetuating it,

342
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:10,590
just using it to sell an image of himself
that isn't true because he came from a

343
00:19:10,591 --> 00:19:11,150
good home.

344
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,070
Right?
So he's basically like a,

345
00:19:13,071 --> 00:19:16,400
a character he's doing like
an Andrew dice clay character.

346
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:18,430
He's doing a pure character.

347
00:19:18,431 --> 00:19:22,430
I think he's doing a copy of Rick and I
think that he's doing a copy based on,

348
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,110
well,
he's way faster than you.

349
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:26,490
Like he's not trying to just
trying to look like you at all,

350
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,930
but what does it mean you're not covered
with tattoos? He's covered with tattoos.

351
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:32,730
Well, you see, I look
like I'm on crack. So

352
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:34,500
you look like a healthy man.

353
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:37,510
God is probably gonna live to
be a hundred years old. It's,

354
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:40,980
it's people that are a really big and
fat that are fucked man. But your,

355
00:19:40,981 --> 00:19:44,640
your heart is pushing extra hard for that
shit on how much cardio are you doing?

356
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:48,040
Yeah, well, you know, when you, when you,
when you got those people behind you,

357
00:19:48,041 --> 00:19:48,431
you know what,

358
00:19:48,431 --> 00:19:51,490
that money and they put some money in
your pocket and you feel like you're going

359
00:19:51,491 --> 00:19:55,200
to live forever, you know, if money
or keep me alive and then I'm good.

360
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:58,350
Well that's certainly what happens.
So a lot of these guys, but it's also,

361
00:19:58,351 --> 00:20:01,020
I think he's kind of stuck with what
got them to the dance and that's just

362
00:20:01,021 --> 00:20:04,860
bullshit. It's just going to bullshit
bullshit until he slides into a wall.

363
00:20:04,861 --> 00:20:06,830
You know what I mean? He's just going
to keep going while he's in motion.

364
00:20:06,831 --> 00:20:09,300
He's just gonna keep bullshitting.
Why would he tell the truth?

365
00:20:09,301 --> 00:20:10,950
He's not going to say,
listen, here's the deal man.

366
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:15,490
Well, you know, I wonder how it, when the
guy goes on radio stations and the host,

367
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,350
you know, they never, you know,

368
00:20:17,351 --> 00:20:19,920
cause I heard him on a couple of radio
station and they never asked him, man,

369
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,730
why did you take this guy's name?

370
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:24,820
Well, why don't you, he's a big
guy. He kind of mad dog's people.

371
00:20:24,821 --> 00:20:25,571
I've seen him mad dog,

372
00:20:25,571 --> 00:20:29,250
some people that have tried to ask him
some things about you and he gets real

373
00:20:29,251 --> 00:20:32,640
loud about and he's, yeah, he's like, it's
uncomfortable to be around like, dude,

374
00:20:32,641 --> 00:20:34,470
that big. Who's pissed off? You know?

375
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:39,210
Yeah. I think we've been doing like a, um,

376
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:43,410
a viral campaign of truth.
And if you read the rolling stone article,

377
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:46,680
he spends a lot of time talking about
things that are uncomfortable for him.

378
00:20:46,681 --> 00:20:47,650
Correctional officer

379
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:50,230
thinks things that he's
never talked about.

380
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:52,210
I totally didn't even
plan on reading this shit.

381
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:54,220
I just got it and I said
I have to bring it in.

382
00:20:54,221 --> 00:20:57,550
Cause I knew there Rick was coming and
then he talks about playing football and

383
00:20:57,551 --> 00:21:01,120
we believe it's because we brought up
the fact that when we called the school,

384
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:03,060
they didn't have a record of him
playing football and look at,

385
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:06,710
so he never played football
either. In check. We didn't
have, we just had this out.

386
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:10,750
I mean we reached out to athletic director
and they said that they don't have

387
00:21:10,751 --> 00:21:13,990
him on the roster for the hall nineties
they don't have a William Roberts.

388
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:19,390
I mean I would love to see you the roster
and picture picture a lied about that

389
00:21:19,391 --> 00:21:23,270
too. Why would that be surprising?
Have you ever heard of all of them

390
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:27,090
American football player without
one pitcher with a uniform on?

391
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:33,120
I don't know. I wouldn't be able to tell
you. How possible is that? I don't think,

392
00:21:33,121 --> 00:21:36,100
I think it's impossible.
All the barriers can be an all American.

393
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:40,440
Like they take a lot of pictures of
those guys and that and but not have one

394
00:21:40,441 --> 00:21:44,730
picture anyway. And how old is he supposed
to be? Is this supposed to be like 40?

395
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:49,530
How old is he? 35. He
graduated 26 so he's about 37.

396
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,630
That what Ted is 36 maybe.

397
00:21:52,530 --> 00:21:55,140
He seems like he's fucking
crazy is what he seems like.

398
00:21:55,410 --> 00:22:00,150
He seems like he's just some dude who
figured out a good hustle and he's just

399
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:02,840
riding it. Yeah. Yeah, he
is. But he's definitely,

400
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,760
definitely a crazy, I mean, you know,

401
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:10,260
they just spent one point $3 million
fight me in court to keep my name.

402
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:12,210
That's what they say.
They paid attorneys

403
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:16,100
now. Um, how did you, what did,
what did you do to defend yourself?

404
00:22:16,101 --> 00:22:18,770
Did you defend yourself on your own?
Because you know a lot about law.

405
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:21,310
Yeah, but I had, I had
good attorneys with me. Uh,

406
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:26,070
you brought him as well from a Austin,
you're nessie. That's been helping us.

407
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:29,330
Um, and then myself, a
lot of research, you know,

408
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:31,050
really this thing is
going to come down to,

409
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:34,950
to whether or not he starts to
understand that we're not going on.

410
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:35,841
So they,

411
00:22:35,841 --> 00:22:40,810
they essentially try to like spend so
much money that they sort of drowned you

412
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:41,943
in like,

413
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:45,140
hey, they worked. They worked. They
worked the hell out of my attorneys.

414
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:49,000
I'm talking about a couple,
wait like three months straight.

415
00:22:49,001 --> 00:22:50,830
We was in depositions everyday.

416
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:55,310
Yeah. Wow. How is it again?
What a crazy world we live in.

417
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:58,410
How could that even take three months?
Cognitive.

418
00:22:58,470 --> 00:23:02,270
How could they say they got
nine attorneys, but it's,
that's amazing, isn't it?

419
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,010
You really stop and think
about the absurdity of that,

420
00:23:05,011 --> 00:23:08,210
that they would spend months on
that they would spend months on.

421
00:23:08,211 --> 00:23:12,500
This is his name now. That's his name.
Okay. That's it. We're done here.

422
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:17,000
It seems like that would take three
seconds. It just shows you how mad we are.

423
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:18,440
We're like a mad culture.

424
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:24,010
I think that that with this guy that
once they sent him a bill for 200,000 he

425
00:23:24,501 --> 00:23:27,770
would say, well, what's going
on here? We're doing. Nah,

426
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:30,980
they said it be for 500,000 and he
still doesn't say what's going on here.

427
00:23:30,981 --> 00:23:33,770
Then they send him a bill for
600,000 he still doesn't it.

428
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:37,640
We up to one point $3 million in this
guy hadn't said, hey, you know what?

429
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,640
Let's sit down and talk about
settling this case. You know,

430
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:41,563
it seems like you could

431
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:45,650
giving you that money and then changes
name. Yeah, we got a foundation,

432
00:23:45,651 --> 00:23:48,740
freeway literacy foundation. You
know, have him be part of that.

433
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:52,340
How much would he, would you take that
and then just drop everything? No, no, no.

434
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:55,890
All right.

435
00:23:56,110 --> 00:24:00,870
How much would it cost to, to let him use
your name? You don't have a license fee.

436
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:04,870
There's no license fee. Yeah.
Okay, so essentially say,

437
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:06,730
let's say the dude loses in court,

438
00:24:06,731 --> 00:24:09,760
but he wants to continue to call himself
Rick Ross and plus I guess he has to

439
00:24:09,761 --> 00:24:13,360
compensate you for the UC lose in court.
He can forget it really.

440
00:24:13,361 --> 00:24:17,560
If he wins in court, then like
where are you at right now?

441
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:20,800
How many times do you guys
been a before a judge?

442
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:22,800
Wait,
say that again.

443
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,540
How many times have you
guys been before a judge?

444
00:24:24,541 --> 00:24:27,240
How many times have they done well? What
should I say? Have there been rulings?

445
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:32,130
It's been really like two rulings, two
rulings, three rulings would they say?

446
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:35,880
And what essentially happened was a Rick
first decided to go for it, freeway.

447
00:24:35,881 --> 00:24:38,640
Rick decided to go to federal court
and when he went to federal court,

448
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:42,660
it's not the best place because California
has so much better protections for,

449
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:47,340
uh, I guess you could say personality
rights, name rights. So, you know,

450
00:24:47,341 --> 00:24:49,260
federal course it go
take it to California.

451
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:51,030
We want to you that there's
a better place to hear it.

452
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:55,350
They came to California and first we
sued universal because the university is

453
00:24:55,351 --> 00:24:56,760
the home of def jam.
Uh,

454
00:24:56,761 --> 00:24:59,400
the judge that Rick was late in
filing against the universal,

455
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:04,170
but Warner brothers did
a, a new deal with, uh,

456
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:08,640
with the rapper William Roberts
Rosé last year. And as a result,

457
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:13,120
no, that, that's him as well. This
Rosa is his, is the same person.

458
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:14,740
Why does he have a bunch
of different names?

459
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:15,820
Uh,
maybe ah,

460
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:20,240
we have to, we filed a suit. He changed
it from Rick Ross to Rick Rosé. Okay.

461
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:21,480
Oh,

462
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:26,100
when did you start? Let's steal. The
thing is so much value has been putting,

463
00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:31,080
let me start off by saying, ah, there's
a video of Leo Cohen, Liar Coin, uh,

464
00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:34,740
the president of, of, of Warner
talking about a fast forward,

465
00:25:34,741 --> 00:25:39,250
my name is liar at Leo [inaudible],
Leo l y r o talks about stuff.

466
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:41,970
They don't want to
develop artists anymore.

467
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:44,820
So essentially they try to
fast forward and what are,

468
00:25:44,821 --> 00:25:49,620
what essentially happened we believe is
that that the labels looked at the fact

469
00:25:49,621 --> 00:25:52,430
that this Rick Ross was untapped and they,
and they,

470
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:55,650
and they realize we can just put an
artist out and there's already like,

471
00:25:56,870 --> 00:26:01,220
yeah. And so he said that the
name came out from him in 96,

472
00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:05,390
but it really was like 2007 when
he started working. Yeah. Wow.

473
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,560
That's a crazy case,
man.

474
00:26:06,561 --> 00:26:09,680
I don't know what it would be like walking
around where there's another man who

475
00:26:09,681 --> 00:26:10,514
has my name.

476
00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:14,050
Oh Man. It's, it's awful. People
call you and in the book you,

477
00:26:14,051 --> 00:26:18,340
and they don't know if you
hear my, are you, you know,
it's, it's, it's, it's, it's,

478
00:26:18,341 --> 00:26:22,560
it's confusion. It's fucking weird.
But at the same time, it's, it's,

479
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:25,510
you know, I just want him to stop,
you know what I'm saying? I'm like,

480
00:26:25,511 --> 00:26:27,280
why you got to take my name?
You know,

481
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:30,250
I built this name in and
he had had some crazy,

482
00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:33,840
he was with funk master flex
and they said some crazy stuff.

483
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:38,620
Like I should be happy that he kept
me alive. And, and even with that,

484
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:41,200
if the guy would come out and
admit that he took the name,

485
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:44,940
would be a little more company, you know,
but when you sit here and lie to me,

486
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:47,460
you know, it just makes
it where I'm like, Oh man,

487
00:26:47,461 --> 00:26:49,470
this guy here is totally full of,

488
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:53,010
so are you an appeal right now?
Like where, where do you stand?

489
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:58,130
We're actually in process of deposing
positive [inaudible] call it and Sean

490
00:26:58,130 --> 00:27:00,820
Combs. We're moving forward with
trial against Warner brothers. Um,

491
00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:04,430
the judge ruled in our favor as far as
Warner of others cannot take a statute of

492
00:27:04,431 --> 00:27:06,530
limitations out to get out of the case.

493
00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:08,440
And so we're moving forward
against Warner brothers

494
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:11,530
to trial. Wow. Whoa. That's crazy.

495
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:14,980
Now, what I will say is that there's two
fundamental differences with what Rick,

496
00:27:15,370 --> 00:27:19,900
Rick Ross has done with them with freeway
Rick versus 50 cents of Jay z with

497
00:27:19,901 --> 00:27:23,710
jazz old. And the first being that
this is his birth name. You know,

498
00:27:23,711 --> 00:27:27,010
when you take somebody whose birth name,
especially somebody like Rick,

499
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:30,430
you essentially can create confusion when
you walk in the room cause they don't,

500
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:32,080
it's not a nickname,
they're not going to clear it up.

501
00:27:32,081 --> 00:27:34,480
They're gonna be like it just how many
people walk in the room and say I'm

502
00:27:34,481 --> 00:27:36,520
Stanley Roberts. Right.
It's just not their name.

503
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:39,000
So then the second thing
is that Rick's name.

504
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:40,770
Let's explain what you
meant by that though,

505
00:27:40,771 --> 00:27:44,520
because a lot of people don't know what
you meant by Jay z and jazzy jazz. Oh,

506
00:27:44,521 --> 00:27:46,720
was a famous neighborhood wrapper.

507
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:51,720
We're Jz lived and then JC
became Jay z and it's sort of,

508
00:27:51,721 --> 00:27:52,720
he kind of like copy that.

509
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,870
Yeah, 50 sentence.
There was a bank robber,

510
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:58,350
but these are like neighborhood names and
like rights thing was in Time magazine.

511
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:02,190
You know, Rick Ross was in Time
magazine in 2001 the name, you know,

512
00:28:02,191 --> 00:28:04,260
it was a congressional hearings date line.

513
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:07,410
This isn't a name that we needed to
be built up. So when Rick gets out,

514
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:11,170
he's getting approached by Nick
[inaudible], Arya Man, you'll Jeff Berg,

515
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:13,750
the top people in Hollywood.
He doesn't need the wrapper to build it.

516
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:16,270
Name Up.
It's just all so crazy because you,

517
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:21,140
you know that he says that he's
an expert on, on the culture.

518
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:22,970
So it's, it's, it's in snow.

519
00:28:23,390 --> 00:28:27,170
Of course there's an article.
Look, there's an article
where he says an old l one,

520
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:30,410
I mean, I'm sorry. Oh six this
is the rapper show improve XXL.

521
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:33,230
He says it's rumored that
the guy started the crips.

522
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:37,070
Then you come out with the song with
Jay z and dre three kings where he says,

523
00:28:37,071 --> 00:28:40,580
my cousin was a crip herder was a seat
thing. It's like, come on man. I mean,

524
00:28:40,581 --> 00:28:43,700
how much are you going to do to copy of
the man's life? I mean, there are no,

525
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:46,580
I don't, I don't, I don't think there's
many crips and walking around Florida.

526
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:52,260
Wow. So strange. It's a strange,

527
00:28:52,261 --> 00:28:56,250
strange thing to like lock onto that.
I wonder what his mindset is.

528
00:28:56,251 --> 00:28:59,330
I wonder if he just feels like he's
got something successful then fuck it.

529
00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:01,290
Why mess with what's good?
You know?

530
00:29:01,291 --> 00:29:03,870
I'm just going to keep driving
until the wheels fall off.

531
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:05,880
Yeah, what do you were,
you know, but, but I mean,

532
00:29:05,881 --> 00:29:08,610
any rational person would come and say,
you know what?

533
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:12,990
I've done good off of this person.
You know, they've helped me get here.

534
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:17,640
Let me go to the table in, in, in
square this up. You know, let me,

535
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:20,220
let me make right what I made wrong.
Because by right,

536
00:29:20,221 --> 00:29:25,221
he should've came to me and said something
to me from the beginning had had I

537
00:29:25,861 --> 00:29:28,670
not been in jail, he never would
have done this. Right. You know,

538
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:33,120
he never would've came and took my name
had I not been in jail and being under

539
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,650
the restraints that I was under.

540
00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:37,670
And for folks who don't know, we talked
about us in the last time you were here,

541
00:29:37,671 --> 00:29:40,610
but for folks who don't know,
he thought you were in jail for life,

542
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:45,280
but you because of reading a
different legal arguments in jail,

543
00:29:45,281 --> 00:29:49,660
you realize that the three strikes rule
did not apply to your case because two

544
00:29:49,661 --> 00:29:54,340
of the things were consecutive. Is that
correct? Yeah. So concurrent. Excuse me.

545
00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:58,630
So he thought like a lot of people
did that you were in jail for life.

546
00:29:58,631 --> 00:30:00,310
That was what?
That was what it was.

547
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:02,180
So we used to BIM in the labels.
Yeah.

548
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:05,140
What was all in the newspaper
and I had a life sentence.

549
00:30:05,141 --> 00:30:08,710
So it's like if you tried to call
yourself giant Gardy, you know it's dead.

550
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:13,780
You know he could get away with it. I
mean, why would I want to be John God?

551
00:30:13,781 --> 00:30:17,500
Yeah, exactly. Why don't you
proud to be who you are? You know,

552
00:30:17,501 --> 00:30:19,980
can't you be yourself?
I mean you,

553
00:30:19,981 --> 00:30:24,610
you're never going to make your
family's name. I mean, it's very silly.

554
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:28,930
I ever wanted in life was to take
my name and put my name in lights.

555
00:30:28,931 --> 00:30:33,190
Not me. Go out and put Joe Rogan.
I mean, what does that do for me?

556
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:38,020
You know, how does, how does that
satisfy my craving in, in my knee?

557
00:30:38,021 --> 00:30:40,240
And he's actually a second.
Well,

558
00:30:40,370 --> 00:30:42,520
maybe he just thinks that's
the only way he could do it.

559
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:45,010
And when he thinks that there was
like, you know, what's the difference?

560
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:49,120
A lot of the rappers from
me accomplishing something,

561
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:54,160
I mean that you actually go out and
accomplish something. Not where, I mean,

562
00:30:54,670 --> 00:30:58,400
you know, if you cheat and get it. Yeah.

563
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:00,160
Did you really accomplish it?

564
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:03,640
No, I agree with you. I think
anyone rational agrees with you,

565
00:31:03,641 --> 00:31:07,000
but there's people that feel like
they can't make it without cheating.

566
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:10,330
They can't make it without stealing.
They can't make it without lying.

567
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:13,840
They can't do it. So they just do it. And
that's what they do. That's the normal,

568
00:31:13,841 --> 00:31:18,760
goto mode is to be full of shit
and then just just exist that way.

569
00:31:18,761 --> 00:31:20,670
That's a lot of people,
man. That's what it,

570
00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:22,040
and that's,

571
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:25,530
that's one of the reasons I think that
our country is such in such bad shape

572
00:31:25,531 --> 00:31:29,460
right now because we're in a mode of
fake it till you make it, you know? And,

573
00:31:29,461 --> 00:31:31,170
and if you don't make it,
keep faking it.

574
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:33,370
I got a whole bit in my act I'm doing now,
we're trying,

575
00:31:33,371 --> 00:31:37,270
you're trying to explain Kim
Kardashian to an alien. You know,

576
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:41,120
it's like you look at how ridiculous our
culture we're like really is now try to

577
00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:45,790
try explaining sneaky to someone from
another planet to try explaining this Rick

578
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:47,110
Ross thing. You would, you would go crazy.

579
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:51,000
And then, and then the other part
of it is just to realize, you know,

580
00:31:51,001 --> 00:31:53,640
when you say Rick Ross, you're
talking about the Iran Contra scandal.

581
00:31:53,641 --> 00:31:56,240
It really a important part
of American history. Right?

582
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:00,720
And for him to come out and do that, he
dot lutes he confuses the story. So it,

583
00:32:01,090 --> 00:32:03,180
it Kinda,
it hurts the product in a lot of ways.

584
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:07,130
It hurts history. Yes. Yeah. It's
confusing to people. You know, you're,

585
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:10,230
you're clouding it out. And then if
someone goes back and reads a Rick Ross,

586
00:32:10,231 --> 00:32:14,100
like what is this? This, this with
us, this guy who it, I ran contra.

587
00:32:14,101 --> 00:32:17,490
What the fuck is he with the wrapper?
Is that the wrapper? And then it's just,

588
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:20,340
what did they have the same name
like this? Some dudes are born,

589
00:32:20,341 --> 00:32:23,460
the name is Ray Charles. Like, good
fucking luck with that. That's retarded.

590
00:32:23,490 --> 00:32:27,000
You bet you got to change your fucking
name is already a ray Charles man.

591
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:28,530
You know what I mean?

592
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:33,030
Well that's one thing if your mom named
you that. Yeah, you name yourself,

593
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:36,390
you've got to come up with a nickname.
You know it's ridiculous.

594
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:40,070
You know Dave yourself today.
Isn't that? That's ridiculous.

595
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:43,750
It's so stupid. Can you imagine if
you're a young basketball player?

596
00:32:43,751 --> 00:32:47,590
I tried to call yourself Michael Jordan.
Not Michael Jordan didn't,

597
00:32:47,591 --> 00:32:49,040
what the fuck you talking about man?

598
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:53,030
There's already a Michael
Jordan like people are crazy.

599
00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:56,570
This is just more evidence that
we're completely losing our minds.

600
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:57,401
No.

601
00:32:57,401 --> 00:33:00,640
But the thing you got to realize this
is what about if it's on purpose because

602
00:33:00,641 --> 00:33:03,310
you want, you want to walk in
that room and get that interest.

603
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:04,341
Well,

604
00:33:04,341 --> 00:33:09,000
I think he probably started it out
when he didn't have as much of a,

605
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:12,500
an understanding of how
quick information transfers,

606
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:15,410
but it seems to have worked enough that
he's on the cover of rolling stone with

607
00:33:15,411 --> 00:33:19,640
all these fucking diamonds. So there had
to be some benefit to it for him. Oh,

608
00:33:19,641 --> 00:33:21,470
absolutely.
He's covered in diamonds.

609
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:25,480
Absolutely. Where he knew that, that
basically in the streets, you know,

610
00:33:25,481 --> 00:33:29,310
because I basically hid from,

611
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:33,370
from people, you know, people didn't
see me, they didn't get to know me,

612
00:33:33,371 --> 00:33:37,570
so nobody really know what I look like.
So when he came out,

613
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,860
they just had heard the name.

614
00:33:38,861 --> 00:33:43,780
The name was ingrained in people's mind
and people just gravitate to the name,

615
00:33:43,781 --> 00:33:46,150
you know, I had, um, and
the almost in an APP,

616
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:49,590
chuck away without even really remembering
the case, it was almost like, do you,

617
00:33:49,591 --> 00:33:54,170
did you, you know, you know, a fucking
may org, uh, what's his name? No Noriega.

618
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,360
Do you know what Noriega actually did?
Most people don't

619
00:33:57,030 --> 00:34:01,830
named Noriega. It sticks.
Yeah. No tonight. Cause it's
been out there so many times.

620
00:34:01,831 --> 00:34:05,640
You heard it. He's actually counting
on people to not know. Oh absolutely.

621
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:06,690
Absolutely.

622
00:34:06,690 --> 00:34:10,410
And that's how he's benefiting right now
because people still don't know because

623
00:34:10,411 --> 00:34:12,570
people are starting to,
matter of fact,

624
00:34:12,571 --> 00:34:16,280
we did a photo shoot a couple of weeks
ago from a guy who was just reminding you

625
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:19,710
from the Netherlands, from Netherlands,
and he was saying when he came over there,

626
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:23,780
they booed him. Oh Shit.
Yeah. They actually booed
him on the stage cause right.

627
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:26,300
No, it's up. When was this?
How long ago was this?

628
00:34:26,970 --> 00:34:28,640
Uh,
maybe about a month ago.

629
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:32,720
Oh Shit. But you know what? I know
I podcast has legs and Netherlands,

630
00:34:32,721 --> 00:34:36,440
which you know, they're not going to put
that on the news. Yeah, of course. Well,

631
00:34:36,450 --> 00:34:39,230
we'll make the cover of
rolling stones. This, uh, this,

632
00:34:39,231 --> 00:34:42,630
what you're doing now is coming
on podcasts and putting shit on.

633
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:45,950
I've seen a lot of your other interviews
that you've got online and you know

634
00:34:45,951 --> 00:34:50,090
you're, you're, you are,
is spelling it out calmly,

635
00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:54,780
rationally, not emotionally. You know,
you're just spelling it out and it's,

636
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:57,380
and you're saying the same
fucking thing every time.

637
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:59,750
And then you see when people
try to corner him on it,

638
00:34:59,751 --> 00:35:04,600
it's like this weird awkward mad dog
moment. We're just kind of gets loud that,

639
00:35:04,601 --> 00:35:06,860
well, you know, we're not about all
that, you know, moving on something else.

640
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:12,540
We are about money. Oh, rude. Jude
said. He asked him about, uh, uh,

641
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:16,190
the price of, of, of an ounce and shit

642
00:35:17,570 --> 00:35:20,180
though. This is, this is
like, oh seven oh eight.

643
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:25,730
Jude. Jude say he asks you about the
price of an ounce of cocaine. He was,

644
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:27,780
what did he say? I find
real healthy. Yeah.

645
00:35:27,781 --> 00:35:29,970
He said the guy didn't
know the price and roots.

646
00:35:30,090 --> 00:35:32,510
He didn't really know cause roots,
I don't know about no gains.

647
00:35:32,570 --> 00:35:36,600
So it just fuck with him and see what's
up. He thought that he really knew.

648
00:35:36,690 --> 00:35:38,430
He thought he was really me

649
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:42,630
at that time, you know, so he expects
them to give you an answer. You know,

650
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,460
somebody come in and said
they think their butcher,

651
00:35:44,461 --> 00:35:45,660
you going to ask him about me,

652
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:50,600
you know, somebody asked me, man, what
was the obstacle can you going for,

653
00:35:50,601 --> 00:35:53,810
I could just, you know, just right off
the top of the head because I've lived it.

654
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:57,860
You know I was there but you know somebody
who hasn't done it then then you know

655
00:35:57,861 --> 00:36:00,190
it's total rough to him.
So,

656
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:05,910
so he got caught quick that was there
that he can get caught more often.

657
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:12,830
But you know right now,
I mean media is media anymore.

658
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:15,530
I mean it's not a mouse.
We pulled in the truth.

659
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:17,690
That's why it's so good that you know,

660
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:21,470
people like you are doing the
podcasts and the Internet, you know,

661
00:36:21,471 --> 00:36:24,570
because right now with, with the
mainstream media man, they all bought,

662
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:28,990
oh it's done isn't it?
CNN go socket. Yeah,

663
00:36:29,530 --> 00:36:30,360
they're all done.

664
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,650
I mean,
if you listened to the radio,

665
00:36:31,651 --> 00:36:34,350
you're going to hear 10 songs
over and over again, you know,

666
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:35,900
the same 10 songs over and over.

667
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:39,860
The shocking thing though is the news.
The news really is shocking.

668
00:36:39,890 --> 00:36:43,220
There's a lot of shit that just doesn't
get described. And the way it's,

669
00:36:43,310 --> 00:36:45,830
the way it's explained is like,
it's very off.

670
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:49,100
Like try getting the real scoop on
Wiki leaks from Washington News.

671
00:36:49,310 --> 00:36:50,143
You don't know what the fuck

672
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:53,000
they don't give us the
BBC, BBC, his license

673
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:56,430
ABC is great. You know what? It's
also great. I'll just zero. I'll just,

674
00:36:56,431 --> 00:37:00,000
zero is pretty honest news.
You know, there's, there's
people in other countries,

675
00:37:00,001 --> 00:37:03,450
it's still look at the news
and they look at journalism,

676
00:37:03,451 --> 00:37:06,900
like they have an obligation to
show the uncomfortable truth.

677
00:37:07,010 --> 00:37:10,340
And that's why I think that Brandon's
Seidenberg, the guy who spent magazine,

678
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:10,610
yeah.

679
00:37:10,610 --> 00:37:13,730
Shout out to him because he did a really
good job of getting this piece out.

680
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:16,940
And what's funny, we put it in, he puts
in in Spin magazine, makes the cover.

681
00:37:16,941 --> 00:37:20,090
We didn't know it was gonna be on
the cover and then the next morning,

682
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:24,680
Costa Rica Times runs it of all paid
to places that Costa Rican time.

683
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:25,710
Wow.
Yeah.

684
00:37:25,711 --> 00:37:28,300
In other countries they can still tell
the news as long as it's not about the

685
00:37:28,301 --> 00:37:29,710
drug dealers that are local.

686
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:31,970
Okay.

687
00:37:31,970 --> 00:37:34,870
We tell the news about other
shit. You know, it's, it's,

688
00:37:34,871 --> 00:37:36,660
it's a sad statement to where,

689
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:40,950
how far we've fallen as a country that
you just watched propaganda on TV.

690
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:44,290
What do you want to be able to be done?
You know, if the people are dumb and in,

691
00:37:44,291 --> 00:37:48,610
in, in, in, you know, just following
what they say, follow, then you know,

692
00:37:48,730 --> 00:37:52,120
it's easy for them to control what's,
what's going on. You know? Well

693
00:37:52,330 --> 00:37:56,740
it's this Mitt Romney guys terrifying
is Mitt Romney guy is not even a real

694
00:37:56,741 --> 00:37:59,040
human being.
It's the strangest thing.

695
00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:00,960
Yeah.

696
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:05,930
Like straight out of the fifties
those old das father knows best,

697
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:10,550
the Da,
what do you kids doing today?

698
00:38:10,551 --> 00:38:11,410
You're not getting into any

699
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:14,590
treble or, yeah. He doesn't
seem like a real human.

700
00:38:14,770 --> 00:38:19,770
He sat down with some guy who was a gay
Vietnam veteran and the guy asked him

701
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:26,440
about gay rights and he probably didn't
think that dude was a veteran. And uh,

702
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:27,131
and uh,
you know,

703
00:38:27,131 --> 00:38:31,630
it just said he wasn't into like gay
people being married and then the guy just

704
00:38:31,631 --> 00:38:34,930
trashed them after he
left. It was great. It was,

705
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:38,800
but it was awkward watching Mitt
Romney communicate with them.

706
00:38:38,830 --> 00:38:40,960
He's just so awkward,
Dude.

707
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:43,570
It's like when you hear him see
him talking to somebody, he's like,

708
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:46,360
do you interact with anybody?
Like who are you interacting with?

709
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:50,290
Like he's interact, he's like in
some fucking silver room, you know,

710
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:51,490
counting diamonds.

711
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:55,270
And he occasionally has one of his
minions will come in and ask questions,

712
00:38:55,271 --> 00:38:58,210
but these are the guys that he
was really, really, really rich,

713
00:38:58,450 --> 00:39:02,050
like hundred million dollar rich.
He's a fucking stupid rich guy.

714
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:05,350
So he's awkward talking
to like regular folks.

715
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:09,190
Like when was the last time he's been
like a regular dude? Like, you know,

716
00:39:09,191 --> 00:39:12,520
out there going to subway and a buying
a sandwich and shit and he's like,

717
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:13,600
he's an odd duck.

718
00:39:13,790 --> 00:39:16,200
And, you know, that's what we
need. We need some regular people,

719
00:39:16,201 --> 00:39:20,550
people who are out here dealing with
real life situations that no, you know,

720
00:39:20,551 --> 00:39:22,620
the gas, it costs money. You know,

721
00:39:22,890 --> 00:39:25,800
it's like a lot of times these people
don't understand that, that uh,

722
00:39:26,610 --> 00:39:28,650
we have real problems out
here on the streets. You know,

723
00:39:28,651 --> 00:39:31,470
that there's people that have
to ride the bus. You know

724
00:39:31,690 --> 00:39:35,170
how funny thing also was the watch the
difference between the two conventions?

725
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:38,110
Like when he watched the Republican
convention, it was awkward.

726
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:42,700
You heard about what they did to
the reporter? The CNN reporter? No,

727
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:47,080
they threw peanuts at her and called
her an animal. What black CNN recording.

728
00:39:47,470 --> 00:39:51,970
What is it on camera? Uh, I don't know
if it's on camera, but it was everywhere.

729
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,550
It was everywhere in the news.
Holy Shit.

730
00:39:54,551 --> 00:39:57,550
I vaguely remember skimming
through something like that.

731
00:39:57,551 --> 00:40:02,440
But I had to run out the door and I never
want you say CNN reporter peanuts. So,

732
00:40:02,890 --> 00:40:04,120
so when you say it's awkward,

733
00:40:04,121 --> 00:40:07,390
you just look at the democratic
platform and the Democratic of edge.

734
00:40:07,391 --> 00:40:09,730
It was like all accepted.
Yeah. That's wow.

735
00:40:09,731 --> 00:40:13,750
CNN camera woman had nuts
thrown her her at the GOP. Whoa.

736
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:16,270
That's insane.
Absolutely insane.

737
00:40:16,730 --> 00:40:20,690
Tonio has like a, an encyclopedia,
you know, if something happens,

738
00:40:20,691 --> 00:40:21,524
he knows about it.

739
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:26,500
Oh that's, that's pretty intense. He
gives me the only saving grace of the,

740
00:40:26,501 --> 00:40:30,840
the Liberal Party is that
they're much more for a quality,

741
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:33,990
whether it's sexual equality,
racial equality, equality.

742
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:38,770
The problem is when they start doing the
same shit with corporations and start

743
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:41,820
accepting giant amounts of money
and then they, they're both,

744
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,030
they're both basically beholden
to the same people at the top.

745
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:49,200
But you benefit socially when
Democrats are in, you know,

746
00:40:49,790 --> 00:40:53,910
you know, that's how the
whole system right now,
everybody's been being paid for,

747
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:55,360
you know,
by big corporations.

748
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:59,840
It's staggering. It really is staggering
when you stop and think about it, that,

749
00:40:59,841 --> 00:41:00,051
you know,

750
00:41:00,051 --> 00:41:03,140
you look at the amount of money that's
donated to campaigns and you look at some

751
00:41:03,141 --> 00:41:06,080
of the things that people have said that
they would do before they got in the

752
00:41:06,081 --> 00:41:09,370
office. Then you find out what they
really got to do. It's like they really,

753
00:41:09,410 --> 00:41:12,680
it's not, they don't really have
a say. You know, I mean Obama,

754
00:41:12,681 --> 00:41:16,640
if you could get Obama and he could
do whatever the fuck you wanted to and

755
00:41:16,641 --> 00:41:20,090
everybody just had to listen. Do you
think you would run things this way?

756
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:21,320
I say no fucking way.

757
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:26,150
I say there's an idealistic young
college student inside that guy's head.

758
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:30,380
He's too close to that. He's too young.
Too Young, too smart to articulate.

759
00:41:30,710 --> 00:41:34,460
You got to know that at one point in time
there was a dude was kicking back who

760
00:41:34,461 --> 00:41:35,900
was hoping for a better world.

761
00:41:36,070 --> 00:41:39,590
I hear he his finger on the trigger
and he can't get nothing done.

762
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:43,400
That's when you know when you get his
finger wasn't on the trigger. Yeah,

763
00:41:43,401 --> 00:41:46,070
he can't, he can't put it on the trigger.
He can't really, he doesn't see it,

764
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:47,840
I don't think.
I don't think they have a say.

765
00:41:47,841 --> 00:41:49,670
I think it's just like
being a sitcom character.

766
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,340
I think you get in there and then they
tell you what the fuck are you gonna do

767
00:41:52,341 --> 00:41:54,800
and you, you, it's not one
person pulling the shots.

768
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:58,130
I think that's why they killed JFK.
He tried to get crazy. You know,

769
00:41:58,131 --> 00:42:00,950
JFK just decided to say,
listen, I'm going to fix things.

770
00:42:00,951 --> 00:42:03,320
I'm going to run things the right way.
I'm going to get rid of this federal rule,

771
00:42:03,350 --> 00:42:05,900
a bank. I'm going to do that.
And they were like, what?

772
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:09,670
You're out here getting the fucking car
stupid. We're going to get rid of you.

773
00:42:09,671 --> 00:42:09,960
Yeah,

774
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:12,660
you're not doing it. This is a
money grab. This is not, you know,

775
00:42:12,661 --> 00:42:15,480
it's not really all about
running the country.

776
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:20,160
It's about making a fuck load of money
and run the country while you make a fuck

777
00:42:20,161 --> 00:42:21,610
load of money. But you know what? What

778
00:42:21,870 --> 00:42:24,840
they got to understand that if eventually,

779
00:42:24,841 --> 00:42:27,540
if the money doesn't trickle
down to the normal people,

780
00:42:27,541 --> 00:42:31,740
if the normal people keep living in
the conditions that they're living in,

781
00:42:31,741 --> 00:42:35,130
that that revolution is gonna come.
You know what I mean?

782
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:38,940
They said it happened in all these other
countries. You know, which they help.

783
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:41,050
Well,
that's why I know passing these new law,

784
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:46,000
that's what all these national defense
authorization act and the ability to

785
00:42:46,001 --> 00:42:49,570
impound people without having
to give them due legal process.

786
00:42:49,571 --> 00:42:52,720
All that stuff that they're doing right
now in passing through law is to just

787
00:42:52,721 --> 00:42:57,370
prepare for civil unrest prepared to do
things legally because somebody wrote it

788
00:42:57,371 --> 00:42:59,650
on paper,
something that's absolutely a moral,

789
00:42:59,770 --> 00:43:00,970
so that's what they're preparing to do.

790
00:43:01,210 --> 00:43:04,450
They're preparing to do everything the
same way by rain is doing it the same way

791
00:43:04,451 --> 00:43:07,330
Saudi Arabia is doing it. I mean it's, we,

792
00:43:07,450 --> 00:43:11,350
we have to look at all these
places like Egypt and Libya.

793
00:43:11,351 --> 00:43:14,350
You have to look at that and go,
worst case scenario,

794
00:43:14,470 --> 00:43:16,540
someone could go fucking crazy here too.

795
00:43:16,710 --> 00:43:17,520
I got this,

796
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:21,800
I got this crazy crazy and
email and it had a pdf and it,

797
00:43:21,801 --> 00:43:24,330
and it was from bank and it was about,
it was,

798
00:43:24,331 --> 00:43:28,290
it was a pdf that only was sent to
the elite clients and it was basically

799
00:43:28,291 --> 00:43:32,940
telling them how to manage their money
in the midst of chaos. Chaos is coming.

800
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:35,610
It's a specific name for it.
I have to look at my email,

801
00:43:35,970 --> 00:43:39,600
but it was just talking about like the
percentage chances of this happening or

802
00:43:39,601 --> 00:43:41,760
that happening. Walked off. Fuck.

803
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:42,960
That's his soul.

804
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:46,050
It's so hard to wrap your head around
the fact that that might be our future.

805
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:49,420
Like that. Every culture,
you know, since the look,

806
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:53,670
go to the go to the Roman empire and go
look at all those broken down buildings,

807
00:43:53,820 --> 00:43:57,250
how come they never kept up
those buildings? How come
people didn't keep living?

808
00:43:57,260 --> 00:44:02,010
I'm, how can we, cause the whole thing
fell apart. There was nothing left.

809
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:02,431
I mean,

810
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:06,090
the whole thing just shattered into the
rocks and it had to rebuild itself with

811
00:44:06,091 --> 00:44:09,840
time. And that's, that keeps happening
over and over again to people.

812
00:44:09,870 --> 00:44:13,110
We get to this point where we get super
greedy and we have a lot of money and a

813
00:44:13,111 --> 00:44:16,950
lot of resources and the people at the
top just hoard over that shit and then

814
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:18,930
boom,
it hits the rocks.

815
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:21,650
Yeah. You know, like one,

816
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:24,950
100 million is gone be less.

817
00:44:24,951 --> 00:44:29,810
If you lose 5,000 I mean $5 million
or 200 million, you know, you know,

818
00:44:29,811 --> 00:44:32,100
you're not living any better.
You know, you can't, it's only so

819
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:34,740
many cars you can drive in so many houses.
You're going to event,

820
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:36,630
they say after $40 million,

821
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:38,130
your life never changes.

822
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:41,220
Well I think what happens though is
that people get crazy and then they,

823
00:44:41,221 --> 00:44:44,340
it becomes like a mad game to them
and they can never have enough chips.

824
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:46,220
Just want to keep just,
I,

825
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:49,920
I know people that are rich so that's
still get fucking jazzed up about making

826
00:44:49,921 --> 00:44:53,220
money. They still get fired up
about it. I don't, I don't know.

827
00:44:53,250 --> 00:44:55,420
I don't understand it.
You know like you do when you want to.

828
00:44:55,550 --> 00:44:56,580
Like if you were Bill Gates,

829
00:44:56,581 --> 00:45:00,120
wouldn't you want to just chill and
there's no way you're going to spend all

830
00:45:00,121 --> 00:45:04,200
that money. But for him he's got
this empire thing in his head.

831
00:45:04,201 --> 00:45:06,630
He gets off on controlling,
you know,

832
00:45:06,631 --> 00:45:09,270
all these different operating
systems and you know,

833
00:45:09,271 --> 00:45:12,660
having all these computers all in having
this giant market share, you know,

834
00:45:12,930 --> 00:45:16,260
conquering and moving forward and
creating new technology and creating new

835
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:21,000
Xboxes and shit like that dude still
pushing it. It's amazing. You know the,

836
00:45:21,050 --> 00:45:25,380
those guys get addicted. He could,
he could retire a hundred people.

837
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:27,510
He's got billions of dollars,
man.

838
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:31,750
That's assuming the money is going
to be worth anything, you know,

839
00:45:31,790 --> 00:45:34,050
I mean tried to get ahold of some
rolling money. What's that? Shit works.

840
00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:40,310
Yeah. If it's gold, it's worth
a lot. And that fucked up

841
00:45:40,650 --> 00:45:44,910
then when they didn't have anything man,
I mean there was no cars, there's no TV.

842
00:45:45,030 --> 00:45:48,750
People still agreed on gold. Like you can
get me some of that shiny yellow shit.

843
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:54,930
Well back then it was probably the,
you know, it was probably, yeah,

844
00:45:54,970 --> 00:45:58,830
it was probably poppy seeds and shit
and poppy plants and the leaves. Yeah,

845
00:45:59,130 --> 00:46:01,990
they'd been to in those leads so
years. Oh the coca leaves. Yeah. Well,

846
00:46:01,991 --> 00:46:03,540
which is a really healthy way to do it.

847
00:46:03,541 --> 00:46:07,950
They say for high altitude people
in Peru, they a, or you know,

848
00:46:07,951 --> 00:46:08,700
you say pedal,

849
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:11,220
if you want to do a process check
that you know how to say it right.

850
00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:16,170
When you're in Pardot white guys that
talk like with authentic Spanish accents

851
00:46:16,171 --> 00:46:18,420
are annoying as fuck.
But anyway,

852
00:46:18,421 --> 00:46:21,720
you get get ahold of those cocoa leaves
and you chew it and apparently it's

853
00:46:21,721 --> 00:46:23,670
better than coffee and justice.

854
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:27,540
Healthy and it actually gives you like
alkaloids and it gives you some minerals

855
00:46:27,541 --> 00:46:30,750
and shed and a fido nutrients
from eating the plants.

856
00:46:30,751 --> 00:46:33,960
The leaves like chewing it up so
it really is like not bad for you.

857
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:38,160
It's just when you turn it into
cocaine that's when shit gets freaky.

858
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:41,000
The person who found that out.
Yeah.

859
00:46:41,130 --> 00:46:43,970
Who's that asshole started
this whole fucking problem.

860
00:46:44,270 --> 00:46:47,260
You could have just been a cocoa
leaf dealer. Everybody but fine

861
00:46:47,410 --> 00:46:50,890
if it was legal. See people don't
understand. If cocoa leaves, we're legal.

862
00:46:50,891 --> 00:46:52,120
We really have no problem.

863
00:46:52,121 --> 00:46:55,180
As long as nobody processed that
and turn that shit into cocaine,

864
00:46:55,450 --> 00:46:57,670
it's a great thing to have.
If you can make tea out of it,

865
00:46:57,850 --> 00:47:00,280
that gives you a lot of energy.
You can chew the leaves

866
00:47:00,370 --> 00:47:02,700
or even if they didn't had
dispensary's back then. Yeah,

867
00:47:03,130 --> 00:47:06,550
cocoa leaves dispensary's if they had a
weed dispensary would you've gone into

868
00:47:06,551 --> 00:47:09,790
that? Oh absolutely. Really?
That's it, right? Yeah.

869
00:47:09,791 --> 00:47:11,620
That's everybody's going to be fine.
That way

870
00:47:13,390 --> 00:47:15,880
when you get robbed by non,
we'd spoken people

871
00:47:17,830 --> 00:47:19,480
when they know that you
got money and we'd there.

872
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:22,720
The real problem is getting and put
you in jail. And that's the bad part.

873
00:47:22,730 --> 00:47:24,520
So I was going to say,
we're going to take your money,

874
00:47:24,521 --> 00:47:26,190
your weed and put you in jail.
Well that's

875
00:47:26,190 --> 00:47:29,040
what a lot of people don't realize is
that happens a lot when they are rob you,

876
00:47:29,050 --> 00:47:31,600
they take your money, they, the cops come,

877
00:47:31,660 --> 00:47:35,860
they steal all the plants and they take
all your money and they don't ever have

878
00:47:35,861 --> 00:47:39,700
to give it back. It's like, it's
never going to get that shit back.

879
00:47:39,701 --> 00:47:42,910
He'd go through court.
Good luck getting your fucking weed back.

880
00:47:42,970 --> 00:47:46,110
You Ain't getting your money
back. Stop it. You know,

881
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:49,270
it doesn't matter if it's legal,
it's not federally illegal.

882
00:47:49,271 --> 00:47:51,790
So they just challenge it on a federal
level and you've got to drop it.

883
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:56,470
That's crazy. But you know, when the
people can't, can't decide for themselves.

884
00:47:56,860 --> 00:48:00,670
I mean, wow. I mean if the people
vote to make something legal,

885
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:02,020
I mean I think it should be legal.

886
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:04,770
It's the same thing like this
fake Rick Ross Guy. It's,

887
00:48:04,780 --> 00:48:08,080
there's a transparency of the information.
It's so obvious it's,

888
00:48:08,081 --> 00:48:08,891
it doesn't make sense.

889
00:48:08,891 --> 00:48:12,910
So it's still around and it's just one
more piece of evidence that shows how

890
00:48:12,911 --> 00:48:15,760
crazy we are.
The marijuana one,

891
00:48:15,820 --> 00:48:18,580
it's not like there's nothing
that can get you fucked up.

892
00:48:18,610 --> 00:48:21,850
It's not like marijuana is the only thing
that we've ever had ever that gets you

893
00:48:21,851 --> 00:48:24,280
fucked up. You know? And then
people would be like, man,

894
00:48:24,281 --> 00:48:26,890
maybe we shouldn't really be messing
with our normal state of consciousness

895
00:48:26,891 --> 00:48:29,680
because everything seems to be going
smooth as long as people are sober.

896
00:48:29,890 --> 00:48:31,980
But there's a lot of shit they
can get you fucked up every way.

897
00:48:31,981 --> 00:48:34,870
You go to every cvs you go into,
you could

898
00:48:34,930 --> 00:48:36,950
die. Yeah. And then you come back to it,

899
00:48:36,970 --> 00:48:41,110
as you said about the transparency of
Rick Ross mean you gotta look at this.

900
00:48:41,210 --> 00:48:45,490
Yeah. You could have a school, it's
called it school, that they'll say,

901
00:48:45,580 --> 00:48:48,130
we don't want the drug dealer coming
in and talking about literacy.

902
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:52,610
The former drug dealer, let me say
that right. Was that then it does.

903
00:48:52,620 --> 00:48:54,340
No gives talk. No, that's it.

904
00:48:54,341 --> 00:48:57,530
They don't want to I Rick coming
here talking about literacy. Right.

905
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:01,240
But then turn around and authorized
Rick Ross to come in and do hustling.

906
00:49:02,230 --> 00:49:06,970
You just about drugs. Isn't that,
I mean I just, it makes no sense.

907
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:09,470
Well you didn't even learn how to read
until you went to jail, right? Yeah.

908
00:49:09,471 --> 00:49:14,030
I was 28 years old when I learned how
to read. Wow, that's incredible, man.

909
00:49:14,450 --> 00:49:16,460
Your story's so,
it's the,

910
00:49:16,970 --> 00:49:19,610
what I've always said is that the
number one problem that we have in this

911
00:49:19,611 --> 00:49:23,230
country is that people are not caring
how young people that aren't there is it

912
00:49:23,231 --> 00:49:28,040
growing up and you got to look at young
people as like the number one piece of

913
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:28,933
potential.

914
00:49:29,060 --> 00:49:32,330
Like if there's anything
that has potential to human
being and you have human

915
00:49:32,331 --> 00:49:36,470
beings that grow up with no future and
no fucking chance and no hope and no

916
00:49:36,471 --> 00:49:40,610
nothing and no education and no love,
we just making a shitty person like that.

917
00:49:40,611 --> 00:49:43,370
That's, it's almost like you've got
to find out where we're bleeding.

918
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:45,360
If we're an organism.
Yes,

919
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:49,100
a shitty society because that one person
is going to going to bleed on somebody

920
00:49:49,101 --> 00:49:51,050
else.
It's going to create a ripple effect.

921
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:53,710
It's like we've got to find out where
we're wounded. Where are we wounded?

922
00:49:53,770 --> 00:49:57,650
We'll find that spot. Whatever that
spot is. Culturally, where are we?

923
00:49:57,651 --> 00:50:01,970
Where is the most amount of crime where
it's the most amount of despair was the

924
00:50:01,971 --> 00:50:02,900
least amount of love.

925
00:50:03,170 --> 00:50:06,050
Dan needs to be patched up and
until they patched that shit up,

926
00:50:06,260 --> 00:50:09,650
we're never going to figure this out.
You're always going to have craziness.

927
00:50:09,651 --> 00:50:10,371
That makes no sense.

928
00:50:10,371 --> 00:50:15,371
Like this fake Rick Ross' character or
like marijuana being illegal or like Mitt

929
00:50:15,470 --> 00:50:20,350
Romney were insane. Snookie we're insane.
We're, we're an insane culture witness.

930
00:50:20,390 --> 00:50:22,610
We've never been more insane as a culture.
I mean,

931
00:50:22,611 --> 00:50:24,890
I think shit was probably
insane back in the Elvis days.

932
00:50:25,100 --> 00:50:27,920
Shit was probably insane
when the Osmond were huge.

933
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:30,520
Okay, but this is, we've
never been this insane. Well,

934
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:32,740
now's your technology kind of does that.
I mean,

935
00:50:32,741 --> 00:50:35,300
when you think about the exposure
element of it all, you know,

936
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:36,670
I was thinking about my grandmother.

937
00:50:36,671 --> 00:50:40,070
My grandmother grew up in a set in the
town where she saw the same people every

938
00:50:40,070 --> 00:50:43,810
day. We see all new people every day
when you can be who you want to be.

939
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:47,400
It's great if your towns full
awesome people. You know,

940
00:50:47,410 --> 00:50:51,970
I've always said that the thing that we
should do is organize place where you

941
00:50:51,971 --> 00:50:54,130
could go and everybody's awesome.

942
00:50:54,131 --> 00:50:58,830
Like everybody decide to buy a house
and it's one spot. But the bar cheers.

943
00:50:58,990 --> 00:51:00,640
Yeah, you don't want to,
you want a neighborhood,

944
00:51:00,641 --> 00:51:03,190
you want to hold neighborhood for all of
your friends. But that's hard to do, man.

945
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:07,090
We have cars so we fuck it up. We don't
have like a neighborhood tribe anymore.

946
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:10,240
Like it used to be that you would live
around only the people that you knew.

947
00:51:10,241 --> 00:51:11,890
Like, okay Mike, I'm going
to make my house right here.

948
00:51:11,891 --> 00:51:13,990
You want to make your house right
there. We're good. If you hear a bear,

949
00:51:13,991 --> 00:51:16,210
wake me up. You know? But now it's like,

950
00:51:16,211 --> 00:51:19,330
why would I have a house near you but
I can just drive to your house. I mean,

951
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:22,660
Brian's house is fucking half an hour
away from it. I don't drive to his house.

952
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:27,640
You know, Joey's house is a 10 minutes
this way and Eddie's houses over here.

953
00:51:27,641 --> 00:51:29,530
I don't drive to anybody's house.
You know,

954
00:51:29,531 --> 00:51:33,160
like it's not like they're all in your
neighborhood and you go knock on their

955
00:51:33,161 --> 00:51:36,190
door. You know, it's not like you're
all together in a little tribe.

956
00:51:36,310 --> 00:51:40,000
So we're all dysfunctional because we
have these giant groups that you would

957
00:51:40,001 --> 00:51:42,400
think, oh, these mother
fuckers all know each other.

958
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:45,220
This is a giant group of 20
million people living in La.

959
00:51:45,460 --> 00:51:48,700
But now nobody knows anybody.
You don't know anybody anywhere near you.

960
00:51:48,820 --> 00:51:52,180
You're constantly surrounded by strangers.
It's the weirdest thing ever.

961
00:51:52,270 --> 00:51:54,210
And people were really
shitty. Now, I mean,

962
00:51:54,570 --> 00:51:57,840
have you tried to pull over like
changing lanes on the freeway,

963
00:51:57,850 --> 00:52:00,480
on the street and the guy next
to you speeds up and yeah,

964
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:03,550
he's going just fast enough to keep
you from getting over. And I'm like,

965
00:52:03,551 --> 00:52:06,670
Damn Buddy. I mean, what was it
going to give you 10 seconds.

966
00:52:06,671 --> 00:52:08,080
You can get there 10 seconds later.

967
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:11,820
Well that's the whole thing that comes
out of that. Not knowing everybody. Yeah.

968
00:52:11,890 --> 00:52:15,220
Because essentially you don't have to
be responsible. Today I might meet you,

969
00:52:15,370 --> 00:52:16,151
never see you again,

970
00:52:16,151 --> 00:52:19,180
so I can be whoever I want to be to you
and then tomorrow I'm gonna see all new

971
00:52:19,181 --> 00:52:22,900
people. That is true. That is true
and that's not good necessarily,

972
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:26,950
but the other hand is you get exposure
to a lot of different kinds of people.

973
00:52:26,951 --> 00:52:27,630
She get a pretty,

974
00:52:27,630 --> 00:52:31,810
a pretty broad sense of what's possible
when you think about like meeting human

975
00:52:31,811 --> 00:52:32,441
beings,
you know,

976
00:52:32,441 --> 00:52:36,700
we're a regular person might not get
such a crazy view of people that if they

977
00:52:36,701 --> 00:52:40,060
all watching Kim Kardashians.
That's true.

978
00:52:40,061 --> 00:52:44,590
If you just go to the same spot every
day for lunch, same Hollywood club.

979
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:50,080
Wait for famous people to walk in.
Who's Dad? Is that her sneaky. Sneaky.

980
00:52:50,620 --> 00:52:55,420
Oh, that fact never crossed the
temporary. What's her son's name? Guido.

981
00:52:55,600 --> 00:53:00,190
Is that what his name is? That his
name is that she just made that up.

982
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:04,840
Please.
Please let hairy baby.

983
00:53:04,841 --> 00:53:09,760
I heard that to Harry Baby. No keys,
baby probably is going to turn it out.

984
00:53:09,761 --> 00:53:13,430
It's just all snatch hair that fell off
during the birth and just stuck to his

985
00:53:13,431 --> 00:53:17,000
head. You can't clean them
off. You just scrub all day.

986
00:53:17,001 --> 00:53:19,550
Those fucking hairs are
glued into this head.

987
00:53:19,970 --> 00:53:24,650
Lorenzo dried snuffy snatched juice.
It's better than gorilla glue.

988
00:53:26,130 --> 00:53:27,750
Could you imagine,
man,

989
00:53:28,020 --> 00:53:31,270
you're going to wake up and be fucking
four years old and you go wait a minute.

990
00:53:31,271 --> 00:53:36,100
Mile. What do you do? What do you do
that check from that show? Oh Shit, Matt,

991
00:53:36,101 --> 00:53:38,940
would you be in like five
year old watching Jersey
shore and that's your mom and

992
00:53:38,941 --> 00:53:41,070
she gets punched in the face
by some dude at the bar.

993
00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:44,790
Did you ever see her get punched in
the face? She got punched in the face,

994
00:53:44,791 --> 00:53:46,880
man by a teacher.
Wow.

995
00:53:47,010 --> 00:53:50,550
You know you're in an annoying can't
when a teacher is at a bar and he punches

996
00:53:50,551 --> 00:53:55,470
you in the face, imagine be 30th so
when it's a your son, and by the way,

997
00:53:55,770 --> 00:53:57,690
the guy who punched her,

998
00:53:57,691 --> 00:54:02,310
it was like a teacher and an MMA fighter
and she was like saying something to

999
00:54:02,311 --> 00:54:07,260
her and she just punched her right
in the face on TV. Like what?

1000
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:11,100
First of all, what a piece of
shit that dude is like this.

1001
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:15,030
If he didn't know a camera was there,
like he didn't know he was just hammered.

1002
00:54:15,031 --> 00:54:18,750
He had no idea they rushed him to jail.
Oh fuck yeah,

1003
00:54:19,170 --> 00:54:24,150
of course they did the quickness saw
dude. He cracked her too. Yeah. Yeah.

1004
00:54:24,220 --> 00:54:27,060
What did you try and we saw it
with a deadly weapon. Well, no,

1005
00:54:27,061 --> 00:54:30,990
because he didn't hit her with anything.
So I think it's just a soil arch.

1006
00:54:31,020 --> 00:54:35,400
MMA fighter. Yeah. But I don't
think Pam, I don't think I'm,

1007
00:54:35,490 --> 00:54:37,920
it matters man. People think
that it matters. Like, Oh man,

1008
00:54:37,921 --> 00:54:41,490
your hands with deadly weapons. No, but
you know, it doesn't matter man. Shoes.

1009
00:54:41,790 --> 00:54:44,940
Shoes are weapons. You got
a problem. You pulling it up

1010
00:54:48,330 --> 00:54:51,480
right here. Watch this shit.
Yeah. This is a watch this shit.

1011
00:54:51,870 --> 00:54:55,470
Oh.
Oh,

1012
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:59,220
that's a cracked her one more time.
Oh,

1013
00:54:59,740 --> 00:55:04,470
it's kind of a slap punch
punch man. It just wasn't good.

1014
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:07,650
He was an MMA fighter,
but I bet he got his ass kicked a lot.

1015
00:55:09,810 --> 00:55:13,920
Well he went that he probably got
paid a lot of money to punch her.

1016
00:55:15,450 --> 00:55:16,680
Do you think they paid him to punch her?

1017
00:55:17,610 --> 00:55:22,530
I do know that show is completely fucking
like 99% fail. Even think of that.

1018
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:25,920
I don't know about a punch though.
That's pretty fucking real. Right?

1019
00:55:25,921 --> 00:55:28,870
That seems like you really did hit
her. It did seem like he did. Yeah.

1020
00:55:28,950 --> 00:55:32,430
But you know, they can fake them.
Those motherfuckers got us again.

1021
00:55:32,550 --> 00:55:35,490
I had a fake punch,
a dude once and I accidentally hit him.

1022
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:38,490
It was like a fake bar
fight in a, in a, um,

1023
00:55:38,620 --> 00:55:42,640
a sitcom and I accidentally hit the
dude. Yeah, you could. You could.

1024
00:55:42,770 --> 00:55:47,190
But I think like sometimes like
in, um, uh, those fight scenes,

1025
00:55:47,490 --> 00:55:50,280
like dudes get really fucked up.
I didn't, Sylvester Stallone,

1026
00:55:50,300 --> 00:55:54,810
he broke his fucking neck and like
60 years old filming a fight scene.

1027
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:58,820
Apparently his neck is fused
with a plate. Yeah. Yeah.

1028
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:02,970
I tell them about the beer that you heard.
Do you remember about Oh,

1029
00:56:02,971 --> 00:56:04,880
by William Roberts beard.
This bank,

1030
00:56:05,770 --> 00:56:09,960
his beard got online where they show
you how to fix his beard out. Oh.

1031
00:56:09,961 --> 00:56:12,660
How'd they make it thicker or
something where you know his beard.

1032
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:14,760
He can't grow facial hair.

1033
00:56:16,140 --> 00:56:20,850
Come on carpet in fucking out of here now.
You just made that shit up for real.

1034
00:56:20,851 --> 00:56:23,830
It's not, they showed it to me. No, they
showed it to me online. A girl was like,

1035
00:56:23,831 --> 00:56:24,510
Hey,

1036
00:56:24,510 --> 00:56:28,210
uh, go right here and you can see how
they fix his beard. His beard is not real.

1037
00:56:28,211 --> 00:56:32,200
It's a piece of carpet. She made
a good point. She was like, Rick,

1038
00:56:32,201 --> 00:56:36,490
how long you've been going your beer? And
I say, oh, since I was 18 she said, well,

1039
00:56:36,610 --> 00:56:40,510
you got holes in your beer. I said, yeah,
always trying to get those filled in.

1040
00:56:40,511 --> 00:56:43,780
And he never fell in. She said, well
look at here is you don't have anywhere.

1041
00:56:44,380 --> 00:56:45,460
He said,
isn't it perfect?

1042
00:56:45,710 --> 00:56:48,320
Brian grows a beard.
You don't have holes in your beard.

1043
00:56:48,321 --> 00:56:49,154
You Shit grows pretty thick.

1044
00:56:49,420 --> 00:56:53,130
Uh, yeah. It's, yeah,

1045
00:56:53,940 --> 00:56:56,790
I can grow a pretty
thick beer too, man. I,

1046
00:56:57,240 --> 00:56:59,600
they got it online where you
can see the guy fix it up.

1047
00:56:59,660 --> 00:57:03,180
You can see like them glue it down and
shit and the whole thing. That's crazy.

1048
00:57:03,380 --> 00:57:04,360
The whole,
that doesn't mean

1049
00:57:04,580 --> 00:57:08,840
any sense. Do you think the task
was a real, imagine that shit's real

1050
00:57:10,970 --> 00:57:13,790
tattoos or fake? Like you catch him
in the shower. It's all running.

1051
00:57:13,830 --> 00:57:17,790
Can you take the Rick Ross offers
knuckles? That's bizarre. Huh? Huh?

1052
00:57:17,850 --> 00:57:21,030
It's got your name on his knuckle
and then he says he doesn't know you.

1053
00:57:21,031 --> 00:57:25,770
I don't know you
so strange.

1054
00:57:26,430 --> 00:57:30,650
Oh Wow. It gives you the
finger. Wow. You know,

1055
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:33,910
we're going around now and you know,
basically just, just trying to, uh,

1056
00:57:35,730 --> 00:57:37,770
trying to do what we just talked about,
you know,

1057
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:42,230
educating the kids that are on becoming
critical thinkers and let them know that,

1058
00:57:42,231 --> 00:57:46,920
that eventually we're going to have to
take the power back into our own hands or,

1059
00:57:47,190 --> 00:57:48,330
you know,
be led to slaughter.

1060
00:57:48,540 --> 00:57:51,950
We have a nonprofit now to free
freeway literacy.org. You know,

1061
00:57:51,951 --> 00:57:53,090
pretty wide literacy foundation.

1062
00:57:53,091 --> 00:57:55,820
Been talking to a couple of
celebrities about getting involved,

1063
00:57:55,821 --> 00:57:58,190
being on the board. And
it's more, it's about,

1064
00:57:58,250 --> 00:57:59,960
of course literacy in regard to reading,

1065
00:57:59,961 --> 00:58:02,510
but also leadership literacy
and financial literacy.

1066
00:58:02,511 --> 00:58:05,930
Cause now coming back to our point
in this and this whole life podcasts,

1067
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:08,630
a lot of people can read and write,
but the question is,

1068
00:58:08,631 --> 00:58:12,200
what are you reading and writing DNC was
all last night and if he was watching

1069
00:58:12,201 --> 00:58:17,140
sneaky over the DNC and you
went to college, you got
problems. You know, I've read,

1070
00:58:17,150 --> 00:58:21,050
uh, I watched a very convincing
a video today by this guy,

1071
00:58:21,830 --> 00:58:24,260
I think his name is Stefan Molyneux.
He's a

1072
00:58:24,700 --> 00:58:26,940
lots of her from Canada, but he, uh,

1073
00:58:26,980 --> 00:58:31,000
had a very convincing argument on
why you shouldn't vote. He was like,

1074
00:58:31,001 --> 00:58:32,540
it's fucking bullshit.
It's like you're,

1075
00:58:32,541 --> 00:58:36,640
you're contributing to a
game by pretending it's
real. And essentially you're,

1076
00:58:36,641 --> 00:58:38,110
you are,
you're,

1077
00:58:38,170 --> 00:58:43,170
you're giving into this fucking shell
game and rooting on this fake leader.

1078
00:58:44,410 --> 00:58:45,250
And then it's not real.

1079
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:48,580
Like this whole system has been bought
and he had a very convincing argument.

1080
00:58:49,090 --> 00:58:53,170
And also watching the DNC might be like
watching a pro wrestling event before

1081
00:58:53,170 --> 00:58:55,630
summer slam, you know,
might get you all fired up,

1082
00:58:55,631 --> 00:58:58,510
but really what the fuck is going on
behind the scenes and not it saying,

1083
00:58:58,570 --> 00:59:01,750
it ain't Bill Clinton telling you
how much better you are. You know,

1084
00:59:01,780 --> 00:59:04,210
Bill Clinton's just trying to win.
So he get his dick sucked again.

1085
00:59:05,590 --> 00:59:08,230
Get up there and say
something dope as fuck.

1086
00:59:08,260 --> 00:59:10,810
So it comes off and he's in a
cocktail party and next thing,

1087
00:59:10,811 --> 00:59:11,900
some chickens suck in this deck.

1088
00:59:12,120 --> 00:59:15,490
I was just reading the article to Rick
about bill and Dan just to, you know,

1089
00:59:15,610 --> 00:59:17,970
exposing that whole Fannie
Mae, Freddie Mac. I mean, he,

1090
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:22,070
he said everybody's gonna
get a house. Well, yeah, some
people can't have, yeah. Some

1091
00:59:22,070 --> 00:59:24,070
people can't afford a
fucking house. And, uh,

1092
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:27,530
also the strange death of Vince
Foster, you know, he was involved.

1093
00:59:27,531 --> 00:59:32,360
People forget he was involved with some
giant real estate scandal and a Clinton

1094
00:59:32,361 --> 00:59:35,810
and his wife. And then there was a
dude named Vince foster who was a,

1095
00:59:36,110 --> 00:59:39,600
I forget what he did. I forget his whole
deal, but I remember that in Arkansas.

1096
00:59:39,620 --> 00:59:43,190
Yeah, he was a, he was a big part
of this whole case, I believe,

1097
00:59:43,191 --> 00:59:46,180
and he turned up dead and
with 80 went to jail. Yeah,

1098
00:59:46,190 --> 00:59:47,690
with the gun still in his hand.

1099
00:59:48,110 --> 00:59:52,430
It's like they see his wife went to jail
for contempt of court. She wouldn't,

1100
00:59:53,660 --> 00:59:57,470
she wouldn't testify. That's probably a
good move on her part. Well, you know,

1101
00:59:57,471 --> 01:00:00,200
the good thing about me is they don't
allow me to register to vote anyway,

1102
01:00:00,230 --> 01:00:04,160
so I don't have a choice.
Yeah. At this point, you're
probably better off that way.

1103
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:05,720
It sounds ridiculous,

1104
01:00:05,721 --> 01:00:10,110
but this is Stefan Molyneux guy had
a very interesting take on it. It's,

1105
01:00:10,120 --> 01:00:12,560
it's reluctant. It's like, well,
it's all those people like, Woo.

1106
01:00:12,561 --> 01:00:13,970
If you want to fucking change things,

1107
01:00:13,971 --> 01:00:17,900
you need to get out and vote and
you got to go. Really? I'm not sure.

1108
01:00:18,040 --> 01:00:21,670
Well, Joe, I think they, I
think they also, you got to
look at what type of vote,

1109
01:00:21,790 --> 01:00:24,610
maybe on the national level that
applies both on a local level.

1110
01:00:24,611 --> 01:00:27,590
You can vote with your feet, vote, vote.
We're going down to the old council.

1111
01:00:27,990 --> 01:00:29,470
People go vote with your wallet too.

1112
01:00:29,471 --> 01:00:32,470
But people don't even go
down to the council member
meetings and talk about that

1113
01:00:32,471 --> 01:00:34,930
pothole that's in front of
their house. It's true. You know

1114
01:00:35,220 --> 01:00:38,550
you're right. That's true. Local,
local politics are real. That's legit.

1115
01:00:38,820 --> 01:00:41,190
That's why Arnold Schwarzenegger
couldn't get shit done

1116
01:00:43,250 --> 01:00:48,000
because of Joe Rowe. Hard on got in
there and saw what a tangled mess.

1117
01:00:48,001 --> 01:00:50,520
This whole thing was. They, I think they
thought they'd be able to clean it up.

1118
01:00:51,060 --> 01:00:55,890
It's a mess. But I think like
mayors, governors, you know,
things along those lines,

1119
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:58,110
that's real. You know, they can really
change things and effect things.

1120
01:00:58,111 --> 01:00:59,730
You get to have a good mayor.
Shitty marriage. I mean,

1121
01:00:59,731 --> 01:01:01,950
look what happened in New York City.
Like how in New York City was cleaned up.

1122
01:01:01,980 --> 01:01:04,470
I mean, so it's a strange thing. You know,

1123
01:01:04,471 --> 01:01:07,470
a strange thing how much something can
change with the right guidance and the

1124
01:01:07,471 --> 01:01:11,400
right leadership, but federal
level man, it's like if,

1125
01:01:11,670 --> 01:01:15,180
if it really got anything done,
it floating really could change things.

1126
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:17,370
They had figured out a way to fuck it up.

1127
01:01:17,430 --> 01:01:19,470
They figured out a way to make it illegal.
Yeah.

1128
01:01:19,690 --> 01:01:19,931
Yeah.

1129
01:01:19,931 --> 01:01:22,660
One of the things I was even telling Rick
was I was looking at some of the local

1130
01:01:22,661 --> 01:01:24,430
elections in like 20,000 people.

1131
01:01:24,431 --> 01:01:29,410
We could mobilize to 8,000 people and
picking you want to pick for local?

1132
01:01:29,411 --> 01:01:30,140
Yeah.
Elections.

1133
01:01:30,140 --> 01:01:34,580
Especially if you, uh, if you guys do a
podcast to a freeway, Ricky podcast. Yeah.

1134
01:01:34,581 --> 01:01:36,080
You think we should fuck.
Yeah,

1135
01:01:36,081 --> 01:01:40,340
you're going to be residential or
grade on it can't be like to me,

1136
01:01:40,341 --> 01:01:44,450
I barely know the vice president
of freeway studios studios.

1137
01:01:45,860 --> 01:01:47,420
I think you could do it man,
for sure.

1138
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:50,210
You would be able to really
mobilize a lot of people that way.

1139
01:01:50,270 --> 01:01:51,290
People like hearing your talk,
man,

1140
01:01:51,291 --> 01:01:54,650
you got great stores and your life is
fascinating and you think about what you

1141
01:01:54,651 --> 01:01:57,740
know, what a podcast is, is if you can
be entertaining and interesting you,

1142
01:01:57,950 --> 01:02:01,760
you then all sudden you got a group of
people that are tuned in new and they get

1143
01:02:01,761 --> 01:02:04,100
used to you and they say there's
sort of like become your friend.

1144
01:02:04,280 --> 01:02:08,030
And that's sort of what happens on
this show. And so you know this show,

1145
01:02:08,031 --> 01:02:09,620
people know that if I'm
telling them something,

1146
01:02:09,621 --> 01:02:14,120
it's because it's true or it's because I
believe it's true. I'm not bullshitting.

1147
01:02:14,150 --> 01:02:17,200
And when people get to know you,
they'll know the same thing. And,

1148
01:02:17,320 --> 01:02:22,110
and then from there you can, any speech
you're ever going to do somewhere,

1149
01:02:22,111 --> 01:02:24,180
any thing you want to get passed through,

1150
01:02:24,181 --> 01:02:27,420
anything that you want to let people
know about that they don't know about,

1151
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:31,080
you have a voice and you have a voice
that, I mean, it will start off with,

1152
01:02:31,081 --> 01:02:35,520
you know, x amount of people and then
it'll double and then it'll triple.

1153
01:02:35,521 --> 01:02:38,850
And as long as you keep doing it, next
thing we know. Yeah. Next thing you know,

1154
01:02:38,851 --> 01:02:41,610
you got your own fucking radio show,
you've got your own freeway,

1155
01:02:41,611 --> 01:02:43,560
Ricky radio show.
You can do whatever the fuck you want.

1156
01:02:43,610 --> 01:02:43,761
Yeah,

1157
01:02:43,761 --> 01:02:47,210
cause I know I still get people to come
up to me for my last show that we did

1158
01:02:47,620 --> 01:02:49,240
and said, hey man, I saw you on Joe Rogan.

1159
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:53,030
I was at the dub show like two weeks
ago and in downtown La at the convention

1160
01:02:53,031 --> 01:02:56,430
center and men at least five or
10 people came up to him and you,

1161
01:02:56,460 --> 01:03:00,920
that was great job. You did know with Joe
Rogan saw. That was almost a year ago.

1162
01:03:01,040 --> 01:03:04,460
That's awesome. The dub show man there
that that market's taken a hit man.

1163
01:03:04,461 --> 01:03:09,030
The big wheel market, you know Margaret
taking a hit, all the luxurious markets,

1164
01:03:09,530 --> 01:03:12,140
but the big wheel market,
even people who have like Nice cars,

1165
01:03:12,141 --> 01:03:15,800
they don't buy the big wheels anymore.
No, no, no. You're doing good though.

1166
01:03:15,980 --> 01:03:19,740
The magazine you mean? Yeah.
They had about 50,000 people
on it. The car show. Yeah.

1167
01:03:19,880 --> 01:03:22,460
I just bought the new magazine.
They have cool cars in it, man.

1168
01:03:22,461 --> 01:03:24,770
It's fascinating shit like
what people do their cars.

1169
01:03:24,870 --> 01:03:26,990
People do in their cars up there.
Like Mr Cartoon,

1170
01:03:27,170 --> 01:03:30,680
the Tattoo artist and a couple other
dudes. So I don't know who they are,

1171
01:03:30,681 --> 01:03:34,040
but they had some pretty bad ass cars.
But the big wheel market,

1172
01:03:35,090 --> 01:03:38,440
nobody wants those wagon wheels anymore.
You don't want spinners on you.

1173
01:03:39,010 --> 01:03:43,280
How large the spinners last.
It's like the legit lifespan for spinners.

1174
01:03:43,281 --> 01:03:46,730
But I see him once in awhile.
Yeah. Dana white used to have him,

1175
01:03:47,420 --> 01:03:52,220
well, you know, president of UFC changed
spinners, changing people's appetite,

1176
01:03:52,380 --> 01:03:55,730
you know, today is big wheels
and little wheels, you know,

1177
01:03:55,731 --> 01:03:58,670
and the next week his big wheels again.
And then it's the meaning of males,

1178
01:03:58,750 --> 01:03:59,480
you know,
just,

1179
01:03:59,480 --> 01:04:03,230
just a way to keep pulling that money up
out of our pockets so that we don't, uh,

1180
01:04:03,770 --> 01:04:04,430
yeah.

1181
01:04:04,430 --> 01:04:08,120
Take that money and that power and put
it to where it could really benefit to

1182
01:04:08,121 --> 01:04:08,510
people.

1183
01:04:08,510 --> 01:04:11,690
Well, it's also just a distraction.
People love Shiny Shit, man.

1184
01:04:11,691 --> 01:04:14,000
If you can give my shiny ass wheel whoa.

1185
01:04:14,030 --> 01:04:18,050
I saw a dude who had like a Chevy Caprice,
caprice classic,

1186
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:21,260
and there were the most ridiculous
wheels I've ever seen in my life.

1187
01:04:21,380 --> 01:04:24,740
It was like a 10 speed bike wheel.
It was just a phrase. It's like,

1188
01:04:24,741 --> 01:04:27,170
what the fuck are you doing with your car?
This isn't,

1189
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:31,340
this isn't even a car anymore. Yeah. I
see him all the time. It's so strange.

1190
01:04:31,341 --> 01:04:34,520
Like I don't even know how he got
into the car. It was so high up there.

1191
01:04:34,521 --> 01:04:39,410
It was like an acrobatic event just to
his front seat to deal with this crazy

1192
01:04:39,411 --> 01:04:43,640
stupid wheels. It's weird,
man. People are strange. Yeah.

1193
01:04:43,641 --> 01:04:45,580
Well that's the state
of America right now.

1194
01:04:46,210 --> 01:04:50,300
Have you ever understood the
monster trucks? No. No. Yeah,

1195
01:04:50,301 --> 01:04:53,690
I watched them before. I've only been
in one. I was in Quentin rampage.

1196
01:04:53,691 --> 01:04:56,180
Jackson is a giant monster truck.

1197
01:04:56,390 --> 01:05:00,720
He had a monster truck with a picture
of his face. We're from Atlanta.

1198
01:05:01,490 --> 01:05:04,250
I know, but get away from like,
well Quinton's from Memphis. Yeah,

1199
01:05:04,330 --> 01:05:08,000
you gotta be from the middle
of the country. The cool
thing is the height of it,

1200
01:05:08,001 --> 01:05:11,030
you know, looking out over, it's like
you're in a city bus, like looking up.

1201
01:05:11,060 --> 01:05:13,850
It's weird. Like you're looking
above the traffic. It's cross train.

1202
01:05:13,860 --> 01:05:16,520
You see your car.

1203
01:05:16,930 --> 01:05:21,910
He has some German car that's really
popular with the German army and it's,

1204
01:05:21,940 --> 01:05:26,460
it's like a Hummer but taller. Like I'll
try to find a picture of the electric.

1205
01:05:26,700 --> 01:05:31,040
Uh, no, no gas guzzling horrible
car. Yeah. No one's coming.

1206
01:05:31,080 --> 01:05:35,350
Miles a gallon. There's real
problems with electric cars, man.

1207
01:05:35,380 --> 01:05:36,910
You know the people want to go electric,

1208
01:05:36,911 --> 01:05:41,110
but you realize that electric relies on
lithium ion batteries and they get that

1209
01:05:41,111 --> 01:05:45,730
shit from war zones. You know, anywhere
where there's lithium, people are dying.

1210
01:05:46,030 --> 01:05:49,360
You know the lithium and the
Congo, there is lithium. There's,

1211
01:05:49,450 --> 01:05:53,410
there's pockets of lithium
that were recently found in
Afghanistan. Oh yeah. Yeah.

1212
01:05:53,411 --> 01:05:57,310
Lithium is a, it's a
scarce, scarce element.

1213
01:05:57,760 --> 01:05:59,860
And when they find it,
man, you know, they,

1214
01:05:59,861 --> 01:06:02,110
they try to lock down
that area and control it.

1215
01:06:02,111 --> 01:06:06,880
So it's like you're not really going
to get a conflict free car that runs on

1216
01:06:06,881 --> 01:06:09,460
electricity.
Cause that shit runs on a lot of lithium.

1217
01:06:09,730 --> 01:06:12,460
So they've got to pull that out of
a mountain somewhere in Afghanistan.

1218
01:06:12,520 --> 01:06:16,420
That sounds all your avatar. This,
you do it. You're right time.

1219
01:06:16,560 --> 01:06:20,530
They get this motherfucker. Oh
Wow. Look at that stupid car.

1220
01:06:21,970 --> 01:06:26,770
You silly bitch. He's just ready. He's
ready for the end. The end is coming.

1221
01:06:27,130 --> 01:06:29,860
It looks like he's been pumping up. It
doesn't mean it's getting back in shape.

1222
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,790
That's a Mercedes. And is that a monkey
in the back? They get the Sig on.

1223
01:06:33,791 --> 01:06:38,080
That's a dog dog. So that'd be like a
cigar. I'm going through the maid's house.

1224
01:06:40,690 --> 01:06:45,400
I think that I had a crazy dream
about him. Yeah. He don't give a fuck.

1225
01:06:45,940 --> 01:06:49,720
I had a crazy dream about him.
Um, uh, after his whole case,

1226
01:06:49,721 --> 01:06:54,190
and I talked about it on the podcast, it
was real weird band. He was, uh, in my,

1227
01:06:54,370 --> 01:06:56,990
my family's yard.
They had a yard that like,

1228
01:06:57,010 --> 01:07:00,610
was like right up next to like a lake. It
was like a lake or an ocean. But anyway,

1229
01:07:00,611 --> 01:07:03,290
there's swimming and Arnold was
running around swimming with,

1230
01:07:03,291 --> 01:07:07,760
it's like balls and cock hanging out.
And he was really,

1231
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:13,810
really confidential. Strolling. Oh, wrong.
No big deal. My Cock is hanging out.

1232
01:07:13,811 --> 01:07:16,630
It was just so casual. But his dick
hanging out. I remember thinking,

1233
01:07:16,631 --> 01:07:18,940
you got to keep women away from that guy.

1234
01:07:21,020 --> 01:07:23,890
I tough fuck and this is
my crazy dream of course,

1235
01:07:24,250 --> 01:07:25,700
but it was just such a strange dream.

1236
01:07:25,701 --> 01:07:28,480
See some old in shape guy
with his dick hanging out,

1237
01:07:28,780 --> 01:07:33,280
just swimming around near people.
It was a strange,

1238
01:07:33,820 --> 01:07:36,460
people feel like they, they, they
more privileged than others. You know,

1239
01:07:36,461 --> 01:07:40,450
we can do whatever we want to do
because we got on the guns. Yeah.

1240
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:43,990
Do you think that's his attitude?
It feels privileged. Absolutely.

1241
01:07:44,110 --> 01:07:46,950
So Hollywood sty of a lot of guns.
I'm going to talk to my aide

1242
01:07:48,450 --> 01:07:50,610
and everybody else that gets in my way.
Yeah.

1243
01:07:50,860 --> 01:07:55,860
Just shoot loads into or didn't
give a fuck expendables too.

1244
01:07:56,171 --> 01:08:00,580
Did you? No, I didn't say it to Joe. I
saw the first one was good. It was okay.

1245
01:08:00,950 --> 01:08:03,160
Yeah.
The first one was fun if you want,

1246
01:08:03,190 --> 01:08:07,300
it's like a good episode of Dukes
of hazard, you know what I mean?

1247
01:08:07,420 --> 01:08:09,130
But at the same characters like today,

1248
01:08:10,670 --> 01:08:13,180
still good.

1249
01:08:15,050 --> 01:08:16,010
You know what that's

1250
01:08:16,010 --> 01:08:18,250
about is with something that
you said earlier, you know,

1251
01:08:18,260 --> 01:08:22,120
you said that you know we should invest
in kids, but Americans, the old country,

1252
01:08:22,121 --> 01:08:25,400
it's like what it to be where
like 58 then you watch TV,

1253
01:08:25,430 --> 01:08:28,490
everything that's honest for them.
What is the numbers of people?

1254
01:08:28,491 --> 01:08:31,580
I don't think that's right.
Just to be average age of people.

1255
01:08:32,090 --> 01:08:33,030
America used to be a,

1256
01:08:33,031 --> 01:08:35,660
in the seventies it was like a young
country because the baby boomers are

1257
01:08:35,661 --> 01:08:38,300
getting old.
So now America is like an old country.

1258
01:08:38,301 --> 01:08:41,980
So when you sit and watch television,
that's why every, it's all for old.

1259
01:08:42,350 --> 01:08:45,650
So what does the average person,
how old do you have? 50 something

1260
01:08:47,150 --> 01:08:47,983
before

1261
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:51,760
maybe maybe late 40 so I might be wrong,
but it's definitely not enough.

1262
01:08:51,761 --> 01:08:54,100
30 all right, Brian, take
gas before I hit enter.

1263
01:08:54,430 --> 01:08:55,263
Uh,

1264
01:08:55,780 --> 01:09:00,260
35 35 I think I'm with you.
I'm saying in late thirties.

1265
01:09:00,320 --> 01:09:03,010
That's what I say. Cause I know there's
a lot of people fucking these tests,

1266
01:09:03,030 --> 01:09:03,863
let's say.

1267
01:09:05,120 --> 01:09:06,120
MMM

1268
01:09:06,240 --> 01:09:10,980
hmm.
Median Age was 28 in 2012

1269
01:09:13,410 --> 01:09:14,580
so not quite.

1270
01:09:16,780 --> 01:09:19,390
I saw that Joe, I saw that.
Did you see that advertisement?

1271
01:09:19,391 --> 01:09:22,390
Somebody found a old commercial,
uh,

1272
01:09:22,520 --> 01:09:24,960
of you in it on Oh,

1273
01:09:26,260 --> 01:09:29,470
it was like in the middle of
some fields. Yeah. Of a field.

1274
01:09:29,710 --> 01:09:33,690
You're talking about 22 years old.
It was so weird.

1275
01:09:33,740 --> 01:09:37,370
Yeah, it was terrible
and so awful to, yeah,

1276
01:09:37,550 --> 01:09:42,440
it seems like that's what it is
at 28 yeah.

1277
01:09:42,441 --> 01:09:46,820
It seems like it's 28 what?
S in the middle. Not Young,

1278
01:09:46,821 --> 01:09:49,030
but not old either.
Well,

1279
01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:54,040
this one though says United States
median age is 36.9 it says the average is

1280
01:09:56,030 --> 01:10:00,170
36.9 because for men it's 35 years.
For Women it's 38 years.

1281
01:10:00,171 --> 01:10:03,350
So that would say that you are about
right. Yeah, we're about right.

1282
01:10:03,351 --> 01:10:06,380
35 36 yeah.
Either way.

1283
01:10:06,381 --> 01:10:10,150
That's probably older than
people were back in the 70s we,

1284
01:10:10,720 --> 01:10:12,470
we're a young country cause the,
all those babies,

1285
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:16,040
that's why everybody went
crazy and was doing drugs.

1286
01:10:16,041 --> 01:10:20,510
So I'm listening to Jimi Hendrix
and fucking all that shit. You know,

1287
01:10:20,660 --> 01:10:23,930
happy times. Happy
Times. Right. But growth,

1288
01:10:23,960 --> 01:10:28,010
but what a crazy little burst of energy
that time was and then to have it all

1289
01:10:28,011 --> 01:10:30,470
pulled back. You know, it's like for all,

1290
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:35,560
for one 10 year period from between
1950 and 1960 the world changed in a Co

1291
01:10:38,170 --> 01:10:39,003
Raisie way.

1292
01:10:39,140 --> 01:10:42,830
I mean it really changed
like a motherfucker and then
10 years later everything

1293
01:10:42,831 --> 01:10:45,590
became illegal and then they
put the lockdown and everything.

1294
01:10:45,770 --> 01:10:49,340
1970 they passed all those drug war.
Yeah.

1295
01:10:49,610 --> 01:10:53,420
That's when they said no more acid
and no more. Anything else. Stop it.

1296
01:10:55,370 --> 01:10:58,280
People were taking all kinds of crazy
shit that was legal at the time.

1297
01:10:58,390 --> 01:10:59,090
Yeah.

1298
01:10:59,090 --> 01:11:04,070
Somebody said they used to even put coke
in cocaine when Coca Cola and put coke

1299
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:08,660
in Coca Cola. Yeah. Have you ever
had the real coke? I had that.

1300
01:11:08,850 --> 01:11:11,170
The Mexican coke,
which Mexican coke is different.

1301
01:11:11,230 --> 01:11:13,980
It's cane sugar instead as delicious.
Whenever sugar we use

1302
01:11:14,380 --> 01:11:17,100
coke is better. Yeah, I fucked
up. But they don't have,

1303
01:11:17,370 --> 01:11:19,260
I haven't had seen Mexican diet coke,

1304
01:11:19,350 --> 01:11:23,850
but they have cane sugar
instead corn syrup, which is
way better for you. Oh yeah.

1305
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:27,060
Isn't that ridiculous?
Shit they put in sodas is the worst.

1306
01:11:27,610 --> 01:11:32,130
I haven't drank a soda and about 25
years. Really? Totally cut him out.

1307
01:11:32,610 --> 01:11:35,190
Smart. They're so delicious
though. The check a coke.

1308
01:11:37,240 --> 01:11:40,350
Yeah. I mean when you, uh, when
you have like a, a nice sandwich,

1309
01:11:40,380 --> 01:11:42,600
you know that you want a coke to
go with that shed tastes good.

1310
01:11:43,250 --> 01:11:47,940
Burger Burger and coke sucked for it.
You're like, I eat these Kale shakes man.

1311
01:11:48,270 --> 01:11:51,360
And uh, it's not my favorite thing
to eat. They don't taste good.

1312
01:11:51,540 --> 01:11:55,860
They're this big fucking blended shake
that I make where I stuffed Kale in it

1313
01:11:55,861 --> 01:11:59,370
and celery and ginger
and garlic and pineapple.

1314
01:11:59,610 --> 01:12:03,930
But when I drink them, I feel way
better. But I'm like, why can't I,

1315
01:12:03,990 --> 01:12:07,620
why can't something like that draw me
to it? Because every time I go to it,

1316
01:12:07,621 --> 01:12:09,210
it's like work.
It was like,

1317
01:12:09,211 --> 01:12:12,390
I can't believe I'm drinking this
fucking disgusting Shit. And I'm like,

1318
01:12:12,391 --> 01:12:13,860
all right,
it's going to be delicious.

1319
01:12:13,861 --> 01:12:16,830
I'll start talking myself into it and
then I'll pour like a lot of coconut oil

1320
01:12:16,831 --> 01:12:20,100
on and a lot of lot of pineapple in
it so it tastes a little bit better,

1321
01:12:20,550 --> 01:12:21,870
but it really doesn't taste that good.

1322
01:12:21,880 --> 01:12:25,600
If I had to choose between that and a
soda, I would want that. Soda, Sodas,

1323
01:12:26,020 --> 01:12:30,910
just sodas like pain free.
Ah, Kimmy, Kimmy, some,

1324
01:12:31,270 --> 01:12:34,300
but then you won't be looking
at as young as you do. No,

1325
01:12:34,301 --> 01:12:37,600
I won't be feeling as good as healthy
as you are right now and, and you know,

1326
01:12:37,601 --> 01:12:39,960
and health. This is so important,
you know, and not a time.

1327
01:12:40,120 --> 01:12:42,490
I tried to tell him, tell this
motherfucker, tell him to stop smoking.

1328
01:12:43,240 --> 01:12:46,750
I keep telling him I want him to,
he's, he's getting older and he smokes.

1329
01:12:46,751 --> 01:12:48,400
He doesn't take care of his
body. And I'm like, dude,

1330
01:12:48,401 --> 01:12:51,190
I don't want to be over your bed
where you got some cancer type shit.

1331
01:12:52,150 --> 01:12:55,370
The rapper he had.
You heard about that another route.

1332
01:12:55,420 --> 01:12:58,200
What does that work with the rapper?
He had to eat better,

1333
01:12:58,680 --> 01:13:00,630
but he had seizures and then
he had to change his diet.

1334
01:13:00,720 --> 01:13:04,470
That's in the rolling stone. Article
Two oh, oh Rick Ross had seizures.

1335
01:13:04,471 --> 01:13:07,290
So you're the changes that like fake
Rick Ross. So he had to change his diet.

1336
01:13:07,320 --> 01:13:09,810
That's why he has a song called
pine dice. Pineapples. Yeah,

1337
01:13:09,811 --> 01:13:11,130
he's had two heart attacks.
Right.

1338
01:13:11,131 --> 01:13:14,730
And he's made two songs about
it as heart attacks is just

1339
01:13:14,890 --> 01:13:17,950
a lion and slinging Dick
till he hits the wall.

1340
01:13:19,270 --> 01:13:21,760
When you had a bunch of heart
attacks and you that fat

1341
01:13:21,870 --> 01:13:22,703
your shirt,
I'm bloody,

1342
01:13:22,820 --> 01:13:26,550
you know he probably wasn't getting laid
until after he started rapping. Yeah,

1343
01:13:26,660 --> 01:13:29,030
it was probably his balls
don't know what is going on.

1344
01:13:29,830 --> 01:13:32,150
Why so many loads.

1345
01:13:32,420 --> 01:13:37,160
How the fuck did this guy gets so
successful with his dick was like for 35

1346
01:13:37,161 --> 01:13:40,910
years, nothing. All of a sudden, every
day it's like we need more loans,

1347
01:13:41,780 --> 01:13:42,920
more loans.

1348
01:13:43,160 --> 01:13:46,160
Imagine if you will like in the load
factory in his body and then all of a

1349
01:13:46,161 --> 01:13:51,161
sudden production went up by like 5000%
in his thirties the fuck is going on,

1350
01:13:52,191 --> 01:13:53,830
man.
What do we do with all this berm?

1351
01:13:55,400 --> 01:13:58,700
It's just him eating sandwiches,
getting his dick sucked,

1352
01:14:00,620 --> 01:14:05,580
counting your money,
trying to figure out how much he can I can

1353
01:14:05,580 --> 01:14:09,320
give you and still live like this is
part of thinking about it right now.

1354
01:14:09,960 --> 01:14:12,030
In his mind.
He said none and

1355
01:14:12,040 --> 01:14:13,390
I go give him a die.
Yeah.

1356
01:14:13,570 --> 01:14:17,770
Well if he has to change his name to Rosa,
at least he's like set this, the sate,

1357
01:14:17,800 --> 01:14:21,580
the stage for that, you know? Right.
I mean that kind of has, right.

1358
01:14:21,581 --> 01:14:25,090
You said he's sort of using another
name now. He's usually Rick Ross.

1359
01:14:25,220 --> 01:14:28,030
He still using that constantly covered
a rolling stone. Yeah. Maybe that.

1360
01:14:28,180 --> 01:14:30,610
Maybe they did that too.
Was, I mean maybe there was,

1361
01:14:30,700 --> 01:14:34,410
it was like this is what we're
marketing so before we totally lose,

1362
01:14:34,430 --> 01:14:37,510
let's keep that going on. Maybe they
just figured that's the best way.

1363
01:14:37,740 --> 01:14:40,930
Do you think that got to know that
they're gonna lose? Right? I hope so.

1364
01:14:41,050 --> 01:14:45,400
I bet the lawyers listening to this
shit right now. Nah, I bet they are.

1365
01:14:45,870 --> 01:14:48,090
If they're good. Right. Wouldn't
you be listening to this?

1366
01:14:48,430 --> 01:14:51,170
You're on top of everything I watch.
I watched it.

1367
01:14:52,910 --> 01:14:57,110
You know? I mean, just for me, you
know, businessman and I said, okay,

1368
01:14:57,111 --> 01:14:58,550
well we just spent a hundred grand.

1369
01:14:58,551 --> 01:15:01,310
We know we're going to have to
spend at least another million. Hey,

1370
01:15:01,311 --> 01:15:04,340
you want to go and sit down and talk to
this guy and try to work this thing out?

1371
01:15:04,820 --> 01:15:08,220
But no, his orange was like, oh
no, keep sending those checks and,

1372
01:15:08,280 --> 01:15:13,070
and pay 1.3 million out of selling.
They say 200,000 records,

1373
01:15:13,071 --> 01:15:13,640
but

1374
01:15:13,640 --> 01:15:18,640
I think it's probably more like
25,000 what he actually sells.

1375
01:15:18,980 --> 01:15:21,600
No, this heats up my
opening week. They sold,

1376
01:15:21,670 --> 01:15:24,360
they say so think they'd lie
about that Shit. They buy,

1377
01:15:24,370 --> 01:15:28,280
they buy the records themselves. Do we
don't know if they bought him in his case,

1378
01:15:28,281 --> 01:15:29,850
but we,
but they do buy records.

1379
01:15:29,851 --> 01:15:33,800
So that's really what
companies do that all of them,

1380
01:15:33,860 --> 01:15:36,350
they do that just to jack up
the sales to make it look,

1381
01:15:36,570 --> 01:15:38,710
make it look like the guys is hot when,

1382
01:15:38,780 --> 01:15:42,830
when he may be not as
interesting, make him go, go.

1383
01:15:43,880 --> 01:15:46,160
Really? How many do you have
to sell before you go gold?

1384
01:15:46,670 --> 01:15:51,410
500,000 and platinum's a million.
Yeah. Yeah, I didn't know that.

1385
01:15:51,411 --> 01:15:54,530
They just could just go buy them like
that. Well, it makes sense though.

1386
01:15:54,680 --> 01:15:55,513
It's kind of

1387
01:15:56,210 --> 01:16:00,260
unethical or illegal to do that, but
they all practice that. That method.

1388
01:16:00,470 --> 01:16:03,830
Really? Yeah. Well it kind of makes
sense. You know, look, if you,

1389
01:16:03,831 --> 01:16:07,460
if you wanted to think about it that
way or you get like brag about the guy

1390
01:16:07,470 --> 01:16:09,480
selling so much, people
will, we'll try shit.

1391
01:16:09,481 --> 01:16:14,481
The here is real popular and then you
started to get advertisement bt or pick

1392
01:16:15,541 --> 01:16:20,541
you up and they started to play your
videos and MTV and oh he sold 500,000 so

1393
01:16:21,001 --> 01:16:24,110
now you're hot. It's a weird
business. That music businessman,

1394
01:16:24,620 --> 01:16:29,340
that seems like a strange,
strange place to maneuver. Joe,

1395
01:16:29,341 --> 01:16:32,970
can I ask you a question? Sure. Please.
If my name was William Robertson,

1396
01:16:32,971 --> 01:16:35,610
I rapped about being a correctional
officer. What? You buy my CD?

1397
01:16:37,780 --> 01:16:41,230
Yeah, if you were good.
Yeah, man. Yeah man do.

1398
01:16:41,231 --> 01:16:44,110
You could have any fucking job
and I don't care what you do.

1399
01:16:44,140 --> 01:16:47,830
You could be a comedian, you could be
a rapper or you could be an author.

1400
01:16:47,831 --> 01:16:50,960
You get if you're good,
it's not, it's not like the,

1401
01:16:50,961 --> 01:16:54,940
the title of what the guy
does. It's like, who is he?

1402
01:16:55,600 --> 01:16:56,110
You know,

1403
01:16:56,110 --> 01:16:59,650
like there's a lot of people that are
working in Baskin Robbins scooping ice

1404
01:16:59,651 --> 01:17:00,920
cream,
but they're interesting mother.

1405
01:17:01,050 --> 01:17:03,490
So if you were a sat down and talked
to them for a long period of time,

1406
01:17:03,700 --> 01:17:06,660
they might be able to actually write a
book that's pretty fucking bad ass he

1407
01:17:06,670 --> 01:17:09,680
would want to read. He might be
able to rap about ice. It'd be like,

1408
01:17:09,681 --> 01:17:12,830
I'd never thought a motherfucker could
wrap up ice cream and I would think it

1409
01:17:12,831 --> 01:17:13,520
was fun.

1410
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:16,730
It's all depends on the individual and
the context of what they're saying.

1411
01:17:16,790 --> 01:17:20,810
So that guy for sure could have pulled
off talking about being a corrections

1412
01:17:20,811 --> 01:17:23,000
officer.
He just had to be a bad motherfucker.

1413
01:17:23,550 --> 01:17:26,460
I just think rap is so
anti-authoritarian. It's true. You know?

1414
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:31,280
And especially like how he's trying
to rap. Yeah. Correction Officer.

1415
01:17:31,490 --> 01:17:36,460
Yeah, that's true. That's true. Lack
of drug dealers tackle people down.

1416
01:17:37,980 --> 01:17:41,870
People Squat.
We're going to take him down.

1417
01:17:41,871 --> 01:17:45,320
You'd have to be unbelievably [inaudible]
been over and spread his cheeks.

1418
01:17:48,110 --> 01:17:51,020
He would have to be m and m
times a million. Yeah, I checked,

1419
01:17:51,050 --> 01:17:55,520
I checked up on his nut sack.
He would have to be, you know,

1420
01:17:55,970 --> 01:18:00,680
a million times better than Jay z. But if
he would, it's like it's not impossible.

1421
01:18:00,770 --> 01:18:04,190
It's just he would have to be
so good to overcome that hate.

1422
01:18:04,191 --> 01:18:07,220
It would be almost impossible.
Okay. You know what I'm saying?

1423
01:18:07,340 --> 01:18:11,090
I really think that anything is possible.
What can you do it?

1424
01:18:11,091 --> 01:18:12,830
Can I do it and that bump?
Probably not.

1425
01:18:12,860 --> 01:18:17,750
But is it possible that someone could be
so good at rapping that they could pull

1426
01:18:17,751 --> 01:18:21,020
off being a bad mother fucker, even though
they used to be a corrections officer?

1427
01:18:21,270 --> 01:18:22,910
Probably going to happen one day.
Maybe.

1428
01:18:22,970 --> 01:18:27,970
It's possible you'd have to be
sold just it'll be in your dream.

1429
01:18:28,491 --> 01:18:33,210
Don't Arnold Schwarzenegger. Yeah, it
would be William Roberts. It just pass by.

1430
01:18:33,940 --> 01:18:37,250
If not was a corrections
officer. [inaudible] was,

1431
01:18:37,251 --> 01:18:41,420
his lyrics are so God damn good.
You got to just respect it.

1432
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:45,620
You just can't deny it. I never
heard anybody says it. Nah Sucks.

1433
01:18:45,860 --> 01:18:50,000
Cause his lyrics are so good. That one.
We played the whole song backwards,

1434
01:18:50,001 --> 01:18:54,200
like the, the events like you, he reads
them backwards. Like, come on man,

1435
01:18:54,201 --> 01:18:56,060
who the fuck can do that?
Who else can do that?

1436
01:18:56,061 --> 01:18:59,000
Even if he was a corrections
officer, you'd have to go, God damn,

1437
01:18:59,001 --> 01:19:01,040
that was pretty fucking bad ass.
You know what I mean?

1438
01:19:01,100 --> 01:19:05,240
So he didn't have to be that good,
but he's not, he's not that good.

1439
01:19:05,241 --> 01:19:06,230
He's not that good at all.

1440
01:19:06,231 --> 01:19:09,700
Which is really interesting that
everyday I'm hustling that God,

1441
01:19:09,730 --> 01:19:13,100
that's like a good, it's got a like a
catchy beat to it. That was pretty good.

1442
01:19:13,410 --> 01:19:17,660
Yeah. You know that came
from dark alliance because
that's what you said. Yeah.

1443
01:19:17,690 --> 01:19:19,250
That's something, one of the
things that you said, right?

1444
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:20,690
Yup, Yup, Yup.

1445
01:19:21,300 --> 01:19:25,860
Huh. That's so weird. You're
going to close you here for day.

1446
01:19:25,861 --> 01:19:29,400
I'm hustling everyday. I'm hustling
and you must be in a club going,

1447
01:19:29,401 --> 01:19:31,830
what the fuck is going on in this life?

1448
01:19:31,970 --> 01:19:36,080
You know what was funny to me,
a about a month and a half ago,

1449
01:19:36,081 --> 01:19:39,380
I was in Charlotte, North
Carolina. And so this kid,

1450
01:19:39,440 --> 01:19:43,340
he did a rap against the rapper.
You know,

1451
01:19:43,341 --> 01:19:48,080
only support the real oh
wow. To the fake. Whoa.

1452
01:19:48,140 --> 01:19:51,860
And so the wrapper and they all sitting
in VIP and they played around on the

1453
01:19:51,861 --> 01:19:52,570
radio.

1454
01:19:52,570 --> 01:19:57,040
Oh No. Got Guy. He calls me
like, you know what I'm saying?

1455
01:19:57,080 --> 01:19:58,690
Right next to that dude right now.

1456
01:19:58,691 --> 01:20:02,380
And they just played this song on the
radio because he did he know that it was

1457
01:20:02,381 --> 01:20:06,700
him. That was the place that he know. Oh,
that's hilarious. Just talked to the kid.

1458
01:20:07,320 --> 01:20:08,010
This all came

1459
01:20:08,010 --> 01:20:09,840
on and you know,
it's telling my Heidi was

1460
01:20:14,740 --> 01:20:17,870
terrible place to be, man. To
be full of shit to terrible.

1461
01:20:18,660 --> 01:20:22,190
No, I mean that way you can get
the stomach. I mean, he's been,

1462
01:20:22,220 --> 01:20:24,620
he's been there for a while.
You just don't get there overnight.

1463
01:20:24,720 --> 01:20:28,770
Yeah, that's true. Yeah.
He's a slob. That's amazing.

1464
01:20:30,030 --> 01:20:33,390
That's a fascinating story.
It's just a you,

1465
01:20:33,410 --> 01:20:38,410
you're admirable in how you
are depicting it in a very,

1466
01:20:38,910 --> 01:20:41,790
you're not vindictive, you're
not angry. You're like,

1467
01:20:42,090 --> 01:20:46,650
I barely feel like your heart goes
up a beat when when you bring it up,

1468
01:20:46,680 --> 01:20:48,990
you just bring it up
very factually with like,

1469
01:20:49,150 --> 01:20:51,530
okay, I just want what's mine. Yeah.

1470
01:20:53,090 --> 01:20:55,340
But I mean it's, you're not, you're
not freaking out about it. Yeah.

1471
01:20:56,290 --> 01:20:57,300
No I'm not.
But a,

1472
01:20:57,310 --> 01:21:01,950
I'm not going to rest until
I get it straight in the eye.

1473
01:21:02,250 --> 01:21:04,920
He don't understand that type
of person that I am. You know,

1474
01:21:04,921 --> 01:21:07,380
when I had my life sentence in prison,

1475
01:21:07,590 --> 01:21:10,260
one of the things that I committed
myself to was getting out of prison.

1476
01:21:10,680 --> 01:21:14,550
And now one of the things
that I'm committed to right
now is to get my name back,

1477
01:21:15,150 --> 01:21:19,440
you know, to stop him from using my name
and I want my name back with interest,

1478
01:21:20,100 --> 01:21:22,260
you know,
gimme my interest with my name.

1479
01:21:22,870 --> 01:21:26,230
How much did you take to shut up?
I don't need to say shut up.

1480
01:21:26,231 --> 01:21:28,810
That's disrespectful.
How much would you take to drop it?

1481
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:34,600
I don't know. I really, I really
couldn't say right now. Uh,

1482
01:21:34,820 --> 01:21:37,370
we'd have to sit down and crunch
the numbers cause you know,

1483
01:21:37,371 --> 01:21:38,880
I got attorneys that I got to pay to.

1484
01:21:39,320 --> 01:21:43,380
These guys been helping me out of
the kindness of their heart and, and,

1485
01:21:43,420 --> 01:21:44,630
and it's put a strain on me,

1486
01:21:44,660 --> 01:21:47,810
you to fight in this case because
I don't make much money. You know,

1487
01:21:47,811 --> 01:21:50,420
I get a few dollars in the work
that I'm doing right now. You know,

1488
01:21:50,421 --> 01:21:53,090
when I go out to a high school and speak,
they don't pay me for that.

1489
01:21:53,091 --> 01:21:53,924
I take books.

1490
01:21:54,010 --> 01:21:58,060
We need a Rick Ross podcast and a
Rick Ross t shirt. Well, let's do it.

1491
01:21:58,150 --> 01:22:02,560
As soon as you start selling them on the
podcast, we do that. Just that alone, man.

1492
01:22:02,561 --> 01:22:05,470
I'm telling you. I did.
Yeah. I, everywhere I go,

1493
01:22:05,471 --> 01:22:09,880
I see these machine tee shirts from
Bert Kreischer for Christ as a comedian

1494
01:22:09,881 --> 01:22:10,420
friend of ours,

1495
01:22:10,420 --> 01:22:14,560
he told a story on the podcast about
getting drunk and Russia and he was saying

1496
01:22:14,561 --> 01:22:17,170
the wrong. He was saying, I'm the,
I'm a machine. I'm the machine.

1497
01:22:17,200 --> 01:22:18,520
That's what he's telling
all these Russian people.

1498
01:22:18,521 --> 01:22:20,140
He didn't know what the fuck
you're saying. And he's hammered.

1499
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:24,130
So it became a hilarious story that
now he sold these shirts that say the

1500
01:22:24,131 --> 01:22:27,010
machine on the bottom,
these fucking shirts are everywhere.

1501
01:22:27,040 --> 01:22:30,010
I seen them in the country smart too.
Cause I got to see him in Dayton.

1502
01:22:30,011 --> 01:22:32,480
He will do the whole
machine story like an,

1503
01:22:32,660 --> 01:22:35,710
it's like a new version of it where he's
tightened it up and made like, you know,

1504
01:22:35,740 --> 01:22:39,340
like just even put it to the next level.
And then when he's done he's like,

1505
01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:40,990
and I have machines shirts out front.

1506
01:22:41,020 --> 01:22:44,950
And then like everybody after hearing
that amazing stories like hello, bye bye.

1507
01:22:44,951 --> 01:22:45,910
You can't go wrong.

1508
01:22:46,220 --> 01:22:49,760
Gets rid of thousands of those. Fuck
yes. I see those desk squad shirts.

1509
01:22:49,970 --> 01:22:52,610
I see death squad shirts
at every one of our shows.

1510
01:22:52,820 --> 01:22:56,690
I see desk squad shirts at UFC. I see,
I see them constantly. Did you see

1511
01:22:56,690 --> 01:23:00,230
it last night on TV? It was
on uh, America's got talent.

1512
01:23:00,260 --> 01:23:04,190
One of the bands was wearing
a desk. Squad shirts. Yeah,

1513
01:23:05,300 --> 01:23:06,130
that's a pull that

1514
01:23:06,130 --> 01:23:09,190
out. Pull it up. See that's
what I'm talking about. We
need a Rick Ross t shirt.

1515
01:23:09,220 --> 01:23:13,090
We need a Rick Ross podcasts or Rick
Ross t shit. Just that alone man.

1516
01:23:13,150 --> 01:23:14,410
Just that again,

1517
01:23:14,440 --> 01:23:19,440
you need to get that started yesterday
for real cause you can talk man.

And hit their cat on NBC.

1520
01:23:27,810 --> 01:23:32,530
That is hilarious. And a, I saw what
you're doing on your website as well.

1521
01:23:32,531 --> 01:23:34,330

of news about shit that's going on in a,

1523
01:23:39,050 --> 01:23:40,900
in the world as well. Like you, you, you,

1524
01:23:40,901 --> 01:23:43,960
you put like little blurbs of things
that are happening on your website,

1525
01:23:44,080 --> 01:23:47,640
the people that you're
involved with clients. Right.

1526
01:23:47,960 --> 01:23:49,400
I want to be informative.
You know,

1527
01:23:49,401 --> 01:23:52,800
I want to let the people know because
I believe that that just like you,

1528
01:23:52,870 --> 01:23:54,410
you're doing,
uh,

1529
01:23:55,010 --> 01:23:58,740
it's so much bullshit out here that I
want to cut through the bullshit and, and,

1530
01:23:58,741 --> 01:24:02,950
and help the people get something
that can help them, you know, with,

1531
01:24:02,980 --> 01:24:04,730
I think the most important,
important,

1532
01:24:04,731 --> 01:24:08,480
the most important thing is for us to
get our country back on track. Yeah.

1533
01:24:08,690 --> 01:24:10,910
I love the way America used to be,
you know,

1534
01:24:11,270 --> 01:24:14,090
and right now I'm not happy
with the way it's going.

1535
01:24:14,420 --> 01:24:18,350
I'm not happy with fake it
till you make it, you know, uh,

1536
01:24:18,650 --> 01:24:20,930
just be around the people
with money or with the,

1537
01:24:22,310 --> 01:24:26,420
right now these people would rather hang
out with somebody that has money and to

1538
01:24:26,421 --> 01:24:30,890
go out and try to make some money for
themselves. So we got to change that.

1539
01:24:31,060 --> 01:24:34,760
You know, we've got, we've got to
change it to, to where you are a star.

1540
01:24:34,790 --> 01:24:38,600
Everybody's a star and everybody should
be treated like one. I don't think that,

1541
01:24:39,020 --> 01:24:40,040
uh,
you know,

1542
01:24:40,041 --> 01:24:44,940
this guy's a bigger person than you
because he has money in the bank or uh,

1543
01:24:46,100 --> 01:24:48,200
I'm smarter than you because
I don't have any money.

1544
01:24:48,230 --> 01:24:49,730
I think we all created equal.

1545
01:24:50,300 --> 01:24:54,530
We all have talents and that we just
have to explore everybody and give

1546
01:24:54,531 --> 01:24:56,180
everybody an equal opportunity.

1547
01:24:57,720 --> 01:24:59,550
That's a beautiful idea.
On paper.

1548
01:25:00,540 --> 01:25:04,440
The problem with the way this world is
screwed up is that it seems like the debt

1549
01:25:04,441 --> 01:25:07,920
is so considerable. It's almost like the
whole thing doesn't make sense anymore.

1550
01:25:08,220 --> 01:25:09,960
I don't understand finances that much,

1551
01:25:09,961 --> 01:25:13,260
but when you start talking
to the trillions of dollars
of debt and we talk about

1552
01:25:13,261 --> 01:25:17,130
like what the interest rate is and you
talk about like how much people will be

1553
01:25:17,131 --> 01:25:19,520
paying off and where social
security coming from and what,

1554
01:25:19,830 --> 01:25:21,330
when you started like
looking at those numbers,

1555
01:25:21,331 --> 01:25:23,520
it's almost like this just seems broken.

1556
01:25:23,920 --> 01:25:28,300
It is broken, but the only way it's going
to get fixed as we fix it if we don't,

1557
01:25:28,720 --> 01:25:31,300
no it works because it ha,
that's what I'm worried about.

1558
01:25:31,301 --> 01:25:36,301
I'm worried about does it have to fail
before it can be reinvented in a more

1559
01:25:36,611 --> 01:25:40,970
productive manner? Is it, is that like
the destiny, this culture can fail,

1560
01:25:41,560 --> 01:25:44,710
failed. It seems like it had been. If it
hasn't, if they don't consider it failed.

1561
01:25:44,711 --> 01:25:49,711
Right now we have over 2.3 million
people in prison right now.

1562
01:25:50,290 --> 01:25:52,990
We are the biggest, uh,
incarcerator is in the world.

1563
01:25:53,230 --> 01:25:57,700
If that's not a sign that you're failing,
then what is,

1564
01:25:57,800 --> 01:26:01,820
well, what's insane is how many of them
are in there because they didn't sell a

1565
01:26:01,821 --> 01:26:06,230
sanction drug. They lock this person and
it's not like it's not drugs for sale.

1566
01:26:06,410 --> 01:26:10,490
It's not like he can't go to cvs and get
fucked up anytime you want special if

1567
01:26:10,491 --> 01:26:13,030
you have a prescription,
but even if you don't have a prescription,

1568
01:26:13,050 --> 01:26:17,270
you could walk into cvs and just
drink til you're dead, you know,

1569
01:26:17,300 --> 01:26:18,620
no problem whatsoever.

1570
01:26:18,860 --> 01:26:23,860
But if someone's selling some unsanctioned
substances and there's a demand in a

1571
01:26:24,231 --> 01:26:27,830
supply and they're these
dudes selling Oxycontin,

1572
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:31,470
sees a fucking guys live in
behind velvet gates, you know,

1573
01:26:31,550 --> 01:26:35,330
no one's coming after them and knowing
that they're just collecting the just

1574
01:26:35,331 --> 01:26:38,360
watching zero is just,
it just sit in front of the computer,

1575
01:26:38,361 --> 01:26:41,930
logged onto their account, watching
clean, clean, clean. It's like a,

1576
01:26:41,931 --> 01:26:44,000
like a lottery bell going off

1577
01:26:44,120 --> 01:26:47,820
and now here they are giving kids
prescriptions because the kid is, is,

1578
01:26:47,821 --> 01:26:50,570
is moving around fast. They got
some drug that they're giving him.

1579
01:26:50,730 --> 01:26:54,540
Sure. Ritalin, Ritalin is famous. They
give kids that are hyperactive, but they,

1580
01:26:54,541 --> 01:26:57,930
they're doing Prozac on young
kids. You know, this is the I,

1581
01:26:57,931 --> 01:27:02,640
there's my next door neighbor. They were
terrible. Parents are about parents.

1582
01:27:03,060 --> 01:27:07,080
Their fucking kids were always screaming
at each other and they didn't know how

1583
01:27:07,081 --> 01:27:07,891
to handle it.

1584
01:27:07,891 --> 01:27:11,410
And they would scream at each other and
there was a lot of nonsense going on.

1585
01:27:11,430 --> 01:27:14,880
The kids just were fucking,
hey, why are they went haywire?

1586
01:27:15,150 --> 01:27:19,830
And then they started drawing them. It
was crazy, man. It's crazy to watch.

1587
01:27:19,831 --> 01:27:22,260
It was like all of a sudden the kids
would just be like looking at Ya.

1588
01:27:22,530 --> 01:27:25,020
I would leave the house and they
would be bouncing off the wall.

1589
01:27:25,021 --> 01:27:26,820
You try to pull out the driveway,
excuse me,

1590
01:27:26,821 --> 01:27:30,330
that fucker in the street jumping off
the car, you know? But that was normal.

1591
01:27:30,331 --> 01:27:33,460
At least that was like what crazy kids do.
Kids do.

1592
01:27:33,700 --> 01:27:36,150
Then you pull your car out
there and he sees Zombie kids,

1593
01:27:36,870 --> 01:27:38,250
same kids to stand there.

1594
01:27:38,360 --> 01:27:41,570
Chef man, we, we used to call it an
NGL when it, when they would, uh,

1595
01:27:42,150 --> 01:27:45,110
certain guys that they would put on drugs
when we in jail and they would just be

1596
01:27:45,111 --> 01:27:48,740
standing there going back and forth
with their feet and we would call it the

1597
01:27:48,741 --> 01:27:52,310
thorazine shuffle. Oh.
So it's awful when they,

1598
01:27:52,340 --> 01:27:55,520
when they do that to young kids, you
know, cause that stuff really mess you up.

1599
01:27:56,260 --> 01:27:57,520
It's scary.
It's scary.

1600
01:27:57,521 --> 01:28:00,690
How many parents just want to
calm the little fuckers down? No,

1601
01:28:00,940 --> 01:28:02,980
they just can't take it
anymore if you don't,

1602
01:28:03,010 --> 01:28:05,570
if you never had a kid you don't
know. You don't know how, how,

1603
01:28:05,640 --> 01:28:09,460
how's frayed people get? They just get
to the point where they can't take it.

1604
01:28:09,520 --> 01:28:12,880
They can't tag it, drag him up,
drive him, preparing to go to prison.

1605
01:28:12,881 --> 01:28:14,080
That's what they do.
Sad.

1606
01:28:14,140 --> 01:28:15,200
Put him on thorazine and,

1607
01:28:15,201 --> 01:28:18,640
and when he's old enough to say he don't
want it anymore and then we'll just put

1608
01:28:18,641 --> 01:28:19,474
him in prison.

1609
01:28:20,220 --> 01:28:22,440
Yeah it is.
It is pretty fucking pathetic.

1610
01:28:22,441 --> 01:28:25,710
How many dudes when you were in jail
were, uh, were on different medications?

1611
01:28:25,770 --> 01:28:29,220
Oh Man. Ally's be huge. And
will you, can you get them?

1612
01:28:29,250 --> 01:28:30,420
Like if you say I'm depressed,

1613
01:28:30,650 --> 01:28:33,520
well yeah, you can just go into the
doctor and give them a story. You,

1614
01:28:33,530 --> 01:28:35,030
you hear noises or

1615
01:28:35,360 --> 01:28:39,350
really? Yeah. And then what kind of
Shit they gave you? Thorazine or,

1616
01:28:39,360 --> 01:28:43,910
or the one that you just said
a the or PROZAC. PROZAC. Um,

1617
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:47,810
and when they take those, then all of
a sudden they just zone out [inaudible]

1618
01:28:48,060 --> 01:28:49,990
yeah, you would see him standing in, in a,

1619
01:28:49,991 --> 01:28:54,180
in a spot and they just go back and forth
raising one foot up after another one.

1620
01:28:54,570 --> 01:28:57,120
Whoa.
Ngo is called the thorazine shuffle.

1621
01:28:57,450 --> 01:29:00,090
But all those drugs kind of give
them the same type of effect.

1622
01:29:01,860 --> 01:29:05,070
Do any guys in jail ever get
pain medication? Oh yeah.

1623
01:29:05,071 --> 01:29:08,160
You can get pain medication
if you hurt your back. Really?

1624
01:29:08,470 --> 01:29:12,020
All kind of shit. What can you get it?
Hopefully they don't give you a, you

1625
01:29:13,990 --> 01:29:17,470
in jail.
And I don't think so.

1626
01:29:20,350 --> 01:29:22,870
Imagine if you take Viagra
that a dude snuck in his ass

1627
01:29:24,710 --> 01:29:28,060
just seems like a bad path. When I was
in jail and everyone was talking about

1628
01:29:30,050 --> 01:29:34,600
coaches who a time. Yeah. And I
don't know, I didn't ever try it.

1629
01:29:35,070 --> 01:29:38,340
Homemade alcohol. Is that what it
is? Yeah. Yes. Homemade alcohol.

1630
01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:41,580
What do you have to have wrong
with you to get pain pills?

1631
01:29:41,581 --> 01:29:43,620
Like what kind of pain pills they
give out. Oh, you can go in there,

1632
01:29:43,621 --> 01:29:47,480
hurt your back, you know. And so if
you pulled a muscle, pull the muscle,

1633
01:29:47,490 --> 01:29:50,400
get hurt on the football field hockey,
I put some oxycontin's,

1634
01:29:51,180 --> 01:29:52,800
I don't know if they give you oxy cottons,

1635
01:29:52,801 --> 01:29:56,910
not they do have medicine that they give
you and you have to go up and you go to

1636
01:29:56,911 --> 01:29:59,670
the doctor and they put it
in a cup and then white.

1637
01:29:59,680 --> 01:30:02,410
Then you got to throw it in your mouth,
drink some water,

1638
01:30:02,411 --> 01:30:05,610
and then open your mouth up so the doctor
can look inside and make sure that you

1639
01:30:05,611 --> 01:30:08,580
took the pill. Those pills
are like really, really,

1640
01:30:09,340 --> 01:30:10,173
uh,

1641
01:30:11,340 --> 01:30:13,020
subscript prescription medicine.

1642
01:30:13,410 --> 01:30:16,860
But then they would give you like
a hybrid profile and you know,

1643
01:30:16,861 --> 01:30:20,410
you can just bring those back to yourself.
It doesn't get you high. It's fine.

1644
01:30:20,520 --> 01:30:23,570
Right. But the, those are
the ones that the gay,

1645
01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:26,010
how long they give them to you for.
I mean,

1646
01:30:26,011 --> 01:30:28,530
this guys didn't get them
for as long as they India,

1647
01:30:29,180 --> 01:30:32,060
but you have to keep going up to
the window every day. You know,

1648
01:30:32,070 --> 01:30:34,290
some guys go three times
a day to get the medicine.

1649
01:30:34,620 --> 01:30:37,080
But what they'll do is some guy,
instead of taking it,

1650
01:30:37,081 --> 01:30:40,740
they'll put it on your tongue and
get back in the unit and sell it. Uh,

1651
01:30:40,770 --> 01:30:45,310
there must be a skill. You develop how
to Tuck it and hide it. And you know,

1652
01:30:45,450 --> 01:30:47,880
if you do it for a couple of years,
you perfected.

1653
01:30:48,180 --> 01:30:49,350
Is there anything that you would,

1654
01:30:49,380 --> 01:30:52,590
that people would be surprised
that you could get in jail?

1655
01:30:53,180 --> 01:30:54,180
You can get cell phones,

1656
01:30:54,181 --> 01:30:56,940
you can get anything in there that
you can on the street if you guys,

1657
01:30:56,970 --> 01:31:01,280
if you got money. Really? Yeah. Yeah.
Pretty much anything. Cocaine, heroin,

1658
01:31:01,850 --> 01:31:02,683
uh,

1659
01:31:03,390 --> 01:31:06,780
Oxycontin, crystal meth. Everything
is inside the jail house.

1660
01:31:06,950 --> 01:31:10,140
I would have been like
playstation and you know,

1661
01:31:10,190 --> 01:31:14,060
I just like something that make it easier.
Just wasting my time in jails.

1662
01:31:15,940 --> 01:31:20,480
The hot steak deals now give
you a playstation. Yeah.

1663
01:31:20,690 --> 01:31:24,500
That's not bad. You didn't have
it in like, yeah, but if you lose,

1664
01:31:24,501 --> 01:31:28,340
you have to suck all the old games to

1665
01:31:30,010 --> 01:31:33,550
get Paul Madden too to go to share.

1666
01:31:35,150 --> 01:31:39,730
So, um, so could you get a
steak? He was asking, can you
get like a fat steak? Yeah,

1667
01:31:39,731 --> 01:31:41,390
you can get a steak easy.
Really?

1668
01:31:43,330 --> 01:31:44,810
They have stakes for the guard.

1669
01:31:45,930 --> 01:31:50,930
So the responds to about like I heard
about Rick Ross and so I get on the phone,

1670
01:31:56,250 --> 01:32:00,700
he said it like, like it just happened
instantaneously. Like he jumped the yeah,

1671
01:32:00,701 --> 01:32:03,010
you can get, you can get pretty much
anything in there, you know, they got,

1672
01:32:03,070 --> 01:32:07,220
they got guys in the kitchen that will
cook your meal just the way you want it

1673
01:32:07,221 --> 01:32:10,020
every day. Really. But you
got to have money. Right.

1674
01:32:10,510 --> 01:32:14,980
How much does it take to get
a steak? Uh, probably like $5.

1675
01:32:15,930 --> 01:32:19,570
Yeah, that's nice. But it's hard
to get money in jail or can you,

1676
01:32:19,600 --> 01:32:22,250
you got to bring in money.
You got money on the fence.

1677
01:32:22,370 --> 01:32:25,560
If your people got money on the
trucks, they can donate it to you. No,

1678
01:32:25,570 --> 01:32:27,790
they just send it to your
books or say for instance,

1679
01:32:28,390 --> 01:32:31,270
the guy in the kitchen and cooks,
he knows you.

1680
01:32:31,271 --> 01:32:33,670
So he gives you credit and then you
could just tell your people, hey,

1681
01:32:33,671 --> 01:32:35,620
this is the guy's name.
This is his booking number.

1682
01:32:35,890 --> 01:32:40,890
Sent him $300 that'll cover you for
the whole month or two months or three

1683
01:32:41,321 --> 01:32:43,900
months.
So whenever you come in the kitchen,

1684
01:32:43,930 --> 01:32:48,670
he just automatically bring
your tray contracts, contracts.

1685
01:32:49,600 --> 01:32:51,910
Does anybody have it?
Like that scene in Goodfellas,

1686
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:55,420
whether in their cooking they got a
razor blade and the chocolate shop it up,

1687
01:32:55,421 --> 01:32:59,470
the garlic and the fries.
You have it set up like they have,

1688
01:32:59,740 --> 01:33:04,390
they have like a cell that's pretty bad
ass to him. No, no, no. Wait a minute.

1689
01:33:04,391 --> 01:33:09,040
They do fix the sales up, but
not with outside stuff. You know,

1690
01:33:09,041 --> 01:33:13,570
they might have outside
radio. What? Outside speakers?

1691
01:33:13,830 --> 01:33:16,180
Uh, stuff like that.
There may be a blanket,

1692
01:33:16,300 --> 01:33:18,490
you know that that come from the outside,

1693
01:33:18,520 --> 01:33:20,980
which you can't have a bed that
comes from the outside. I fellows,

1694
01:33:20,981 --> 01:33:23,290
they had like a whole apartment in jail.

1695
01:33:23,710 --> 01:33:26,560
They were walking around with slacks
on and shit. No, not, not, no.

1696
01:33:26,590 --> 01:33:29,730
You can't have that in the
feds. They gonna make sure
everybody has the same bed.

1697
01:33:30,480 --> 01:33:34,600
Uh, some guys have special
mattresses, especial mattresses.

1698
01:33:35,520 --> 01:33:38,470
You can get a special match up
the last day before you left,

1699
01:33:38,740 --> 01:33:41,510
all your guys come in and
sleep in yourself. Oh yeah.

1700
01:33:43,570 --> 01:33:46,870
Yeah,
they stayed my last night that I left,

1701
01:33:47,380 --> 01:33:51,400
I left at like four in the morning,
so about seven, eight guys, you know,

1702
01:33:51,401 --> 01:33:55,150
that I studied with and like my best
friends at the institution, you know,

1703
01:33:56,080 --> 01:33:57,580
we just hung out all night,
you know,

1704
01:33:57,581 --> 01:34:01,960
ate chips and talked and talked about
what I was going to do and I got out and

1705
01:34:02,060 --> 01:34:04,660
wow. You know, just the going away party.

1706
01:34:05,290 --> 01:34:09,450
That sounds like you were a love guy
in there, man. Oh yeah. Yeah. I got,

1707
01:34:09,451 --> 01:34:12,430
I had a lot of, a lot of
love in prison. You know,

1708
01:34:12,431 --> 01:34:14,570
it's crazy because even in prison,
uh,

1709
01:34:15,520 --> 01:34:18,490
when I played basketball or something
like that or football and people want to

1710
01:34:18,491 --> 01:34:22,660
file me hard, you know, the guys be
like, man, you can't do that to Rick.

1711
01:34:23,050 --> 01:34:25,000
You know? I mean, even right now,

1712
01:34:25,030 --> 01:34:29,860
you know this guys on the street that
they're wanting to hurt this dude. Wow.

1713
01:34:29,890 --> 01:34:32,830
They, they'd come up to me all
the time in la and like, man,

1714
01:34:33,640 --> 01:34:36,490
when I'm saying my most punch
him in the face, like snuck,

1715
01:34:36,491 --> 01:34:41,210
he got punched in the face. You're
going to snuck him. Yeah, I was with uh,

1716
01:34:41,250 --> 01:34:44,380
uh, went by Jim a couple of weeks ago
and this guy came up to me and he's like,

1717
01:34:44,650 --> 01:34:49,390
big Homie, when I seen, oh man,
it's on, on site. I was like,

1718
01:34:49,391 --> 01:34:54,190
Huh? I was like, Nah man. So I
just get a lot of love, you know,

1719
01:34:54,191 --> 01:34:57,860
because you know, the people
know my heart. They knew that

1720
01:34:58,430 --> 01:35:00,410
even though I did
something that was wrong,

1721
01:35:00,980 --> 01:35:05,180
it was out of ignorance and not
on purpose that I did what I did.

1722
01:35:05,480 --> 01:35:07,820
Well,
your story is very fascinating and for,

1723
01:35:07,850 --> 01:35:10,270
for the people that didn't hear
the first time you were to podcast,

1724
01:35:10,290 --> 01:35:14,930
you were a really good tennis
player and you essentially,

1725
01:35:15,020 --> 01:35:17,060
I bet you are you looking at,
you're in great shape,

1726
01:35:17,480 --> 01:35:21,860
but you essentially had no where to
go outside of high school because you

1727
01:35:21,861 --> 01:35:24,950
couldn't read, couldn't read or
couldn't go to college. You couldn't,

1728
01:35:25,030 --> 01:35:27,670
you stuck crazy.
I stuck

1729
01:35:27,760 --> 01:35:31,540
myself and, and you know
what? Me and Antonio, fine.

1730
01:35:31,541 --> 01:35:35,980
I'll just like 65% of the guys
in prison can't read. Wow.

1731
01:35:37,210 --> 01:35:40,570
So that would be one of the first
things to do to combat prison. Okay.

1732
01:35:40,571 --> 01:35:42,550
Let's make sure we teach all
of these guys how to read.

1733
01:35:43,130 --> 01:35:45,290
They don't teach you shit once
you get in there, right? No.

1734
01:35:45,500 --> 01:35:48,140
You had to force yourself. You have to
learn your stuff. I had to learn myself.

1735
01:35:48,141 --> 01:35:49,940
What I, you know, I had a
life sentence. So I had,

1736
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:53,450
I had a great reason to I how
to read and my Lori was like,

1737
01:35:53,900 --> 01:35:57,080
well I'm not real motivated.
You don't have much money. Wow.

1738
01:35:57,200 --> 01:36:00,710
So I'm not really holding. Yeah. He told
me that. He really said that to you.

1739
01:36:00,711 --> 01:36:03,470
I'm not real motivated. You don't
have much money. And you know what?

1740
01:36:03,471 --> 01:36:04,370
He also told me

1741
01:36:04,420 --> 01:36:08,170
me something that that may be the best
thing that he ever did for me and my

1742
01:36:08,171 --> 01:36:11,440
whole life. And he told me
these words here. He said,

1743
01:36:11,500 --> 01:36:16,390
anytime somebody else wants
for you something more than
you want it for yourself,

1744
01:36:16,900 --> 01:36:17,733
then you're in trouble.

1745
01:36:18,700 --> 01:36:22,630
So what I took from that is that he was
telling me that if I was depending on

1746
01:36:22,631 --> 01:36:26,140
him to get me out of prison,
then I was in trouble.

1747
01:36:27,370 --> 01:36:29,020
So I took matters into my own hands.

1748
01:36:30,030 --> 01:36:30,361
Well,

1749
01:36:30,361 --> 01:36:34,680
only 1% of people ever get back a federal
license and for six years he had one.

1750
01:36:35,310 --> 01:36:38,490
That's amazing. It's an amazing,
it's an amazing story too.

1751
01:36:38,850 --> 01:36:43,200
It's amazing how the whole
thing transpired and the
fact that you didn't know

1752
01:36:43,201 --> 01:36:46,830
how to read when you first started on
your journey to try to figure out what was

1753
01:36:46,831 --> 01:36:49,950
wrong with your case. That's incredible.
Because I mean, you literally,

1754
01:36:49,951 --> 01:36:52,470
from the ground up how to do it,

1755
01:36:52,800 --> 01:36:55,620
I did it from the ground up.
That's why I know that,

1756
01:36:55,650 --> 01:36:57,530
that just about anybody can do it.
Yeah.

1757
01:36:57,800 --> 01:36:59,690
What was it like before you can read,

1758
01:36:59,691 --> 01:37:02,990
when you were 28 years old and you would
see like some shit written somewhere.

1759
01:37:02,991 --> 01:37:07,840
What did it look like? He has to read
a lot of things as a rich person.

1760
01:37:08,240 --> 01:37:09,510
Yeah. Right. Cool.

1761
01:37:09,650 --> 01:37:14,000
Where do you know, a lot of times I faked
it. If it was somebody around, uh, I fake,

1762
01:37:14,150 --> 01:37:15,380
you know,
that I could read,

1763
01:37:15,470 --> 01:37:19,310
write and I would look at it as if I had
read it and then we pass it on to them.

1764
01:37:19,610 --> 01:37:22,040
Like I said,
for contracts when I would go buy a house,

1765
01:37:22,610 --> 01:37:26,360
well I would look at the contract for a
little while and try to figure out in my

1766
01:37:26,361 --> 01:37:28,820
mind how long it would take a
person to read the contract.

1767
01:37:29,720 --> 01:37:33,590
And then I would hand it to whoever was
with me and tell them to read it and

1768
01:37:33,591 --> 01:37:35,600
then ask them, well what do
you think about this contract?

1769
01:37:36,290 --> 01:37:39,740
And then they would give me their
opinion. I think this. And I think that,

1770
01:37:40,030 --> 01:37:43,430
and then I would come up with my
own decision from, from there.

1771
01:37:43,790 --> 01:37:46,730
So when you were looking at the pieces
of paper, what were you thinking?

1772
01:37:47,630 --> 01:37:50,680
Just 1001 1002 I wish I could read.

1773
01:37:50,681 --> 01:37:54,720
I wish I could read when thousand
four I wish I could read. I should've.

1774
01:37:55,950 --> 01:37:56,170
That's

1775
01:37:56,170 --> 01:37:58,740
such a why.
Why can not learn how to read.

1776
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:01,830
So what was wrong with me
when I was going to school?

1777
01:38:01,960 --> 01:38:04,360
Did anybody around, you know that
you didn't have to know how to read?

1778
01:38:05,120 --> 01:38:07,760
I don't know cause I hit it and,
and you know when you've got money,

1779
01:38:07,790 --> 01:38:08,511
what you find out.

1780
01:38:08,511 --> 01:38:13,511
Did you get a lot of people around you
that that is just right and tell you what

1781
01:38:13,791 --> 01:38:15,200
you want to hear and they don't question

1782
01:38:15,360 --> 01:38:20,010
right. And they can handle things for you
too. Yeah. So you just relied on that?

1783
01:38:20,040 --> 01:38:21,990
Yeah. What did it look like
when you looked at like,

1784
01:38:21,991 --> 01:38:24,570
if you looked at the cover of this rolling
stone and he saw all these letters?

1785
01:38:25,840 --> 01:38:28,150
I can't remember now
cause cause I can do it.

1786
01:38:28,151 --> 01:38:30,520
I don't know if I would have
looked at her owners don't really,

1787
01:38:30,760 --> 01:38:34,210
I don't know if I would've, you know,
I mean when you can't read, you know,

1788
01:38:34,211 --> 01:38:35,530
why are you going to be looking?

1789
01:38:35,560 --> 01:38:38,530
I don't think I ever tried to read
a magazine until I got to prison.

1790
01:38:38,610 --> 01:38:40,710
Did you like when,
when you see it,

1791
01:38:40,830 --> 01:38:43,470
do you remember that if
you recognize the letters?

1792
01:38:43,930 --> 01:38:46,800
Family had a magazine when
I was growing up. Oh Wow.

1793
01:38:46,860 --> 01:38:49,400
A magazine wasn't something
that was, I mean, who am I?

1794
01:38:49,401 --> 01:38:54,150
A house with a bottom magazine.
My mother wouldn't know my brothers,

1795
01:38:54,180 --> 01:38:57,630
you know? Uh, was there any
books? I don't think so.

1796
01:38:57,631 --> 01:38:59,340
What kind of books would
have been in our house?

1797
01:39:00,900 --> 01:39:05,480
My brothers was in the same position, you
know, my oldest brother can't read. Wow.

1798
01:39:06,070 --> 01:39:10,000
Even right now he has problem reading.
Uh, my younger brothers could we,

1799
01:39:10,001 --> 01:39:13,020
but I mean, what was they
going to read? You know,

1800
01:39:13,021 --> 01:39:16,200
they going to follow in my footsteps
in my older brother's footsteps.

1801
01:39:16,201 --> 01:39:18,750
So I don't think that we
had books in our house

1802
01:39:18,860 --> 01:39:22,720
and we got to remember, this is
like fresh off of Jim Crow, right?

1803
01:39:22,750 --> 01:39:24,610
It's five years right after Jim Crow.

1804
01:39:24,611 --> 01:39:27,790
I think even though we say Jim Crow
had ended in [inaudible] 65 66,

1805
01:39:28,030 --> 01:39:31,300
it probably didn't set in until,
you know, the late seventies. Right.

1806
01:39:32,900 --> 01:39:33,171
Yeah.

1807
01:39:33,171 --> 01:39:36,320
It's Kinda crazy when you wrap your head
around people saying that people need

1808
01:39:36,321 --> 01:39:38,000
to pull themselves up by their bootstraps.

1809
01:39:38,300 --> 01:39:43,300
I don't think a lot of people understand
how bad it is in some areas and they

1810
01:39:43,671 --> 01:39:48,080
can't even wrap their head around what
it is like to grow up when no one else

1811
01:39:48,081 --> 01:39:48,850
can read.

1812
01:39:48,850 --> 01:39:53,350
Yeah, it is. And or no one else tells
you that you should read, you know,

1813
01:39:53,380 --> 01:39:57,370
and in our neighborhood, the guys are
telling you you crazy for reading.

1814
01:39:58,300 --> 01:40:01,690
You're crazy for reading. Yeah.
Yeah. They're going to tell you, man,

1815
01:40:01,720 --> 01:40:04,510
get you a snatch bore,
you know, go get you a Ho.

1816
01:40:06,180 --> 01:40:08,070
A snatch bar.
That's what they call it.

1817
01:40:08,210 --> 01:40:11,960
Yeah. Snatch bores. Uh, a piece of
equipment that they used to steal cars.

1818
01:40:12,260 --> 01:40:16,490
Oh. Oh. Oh. Snatched initially. Not
with it. I thought that was a girl.

1819
01:40:16,491 --> 01:40:20,240
You're talking about snapchat or the
whole, which is here. He'll get you a hoe.

1820
01:40:20,250 --> 01:40:24,200
I was like, girl, did you know what he was
talking about? Yeah, that's fine. Prions,

1821
01:40:24,290 --> 01:40:25,123
totally gangster.

1822
01:40:25,250 --> 01:40:29,180
The hole was the girl, you know, cause
we stayed on Figeroa so, right. You Man,

1823
01:40:29,181 --> 01:40:31,510
get you a hole.
Put the book down.

1824
01:40:31,511 --> 01:40:35,360
You've being silly and you're gonna not
go make it. Get you a sec. Wow. Slang.

1825
01:40:35,420 --> 01:40:36,620
Get you a pistol and rob,

1826
01:40:38,570 --> 01:40:41,930
how many people around you
were when you were growing up?

1827
01:40:41,960 --> 01:40:43,610
We're not doing crime.

1828
01:40:45,480 --> 01:40:50,090
Well, I was growing up at,
yeah, I don't know. It was
just constant everywhere. Yeah.

1829
01:40:50,150 --> 01:40:53,220
Yeah. Crime was accepted in my
community. Crime was accepted.

1830
01:40:53,530 --> 01:40:58,030
That was one of the things that they were
really fascinated about me lasting so

1831
01:40:58,031 --> 01:41:01,720
long in the drug business is that
my neighbors allowed me to do it.

1832
01:41:02,740 --> 01:41:03,041
I mean,

1833
01:41:03,041 --> 01:41:07,210
my neighbors could have had me arrested
immediately because they knew what I was

1834
01:41:07,211 --> 01:41:11,760
doing. I've even had neighbors to
[inaudible] one time I stashed some,

1835
01:41:11,780 --> 01:41:16,570
some drugs inside a brick wall in
between my mom's house and my neighbor's

1836
01:41:16,571 --> 01:41:20,080
house, and it fell through
the fence into her yard.

1837
01:41:20,770 --> 01:41:25,280
And so she picks up, well, I
don't know, maybe like $200,000.

1838
01:41:25,300 --> 01:41:30,230
One for dope. Oh my God. Takes it in
her house. And then she tells my mom,

1839
01:41:30,680 --> 01:41:35,000
uh, tell Rick to come by here and see
me. And so when, when my, when I come,

1840
01:41:35,001 --> 01:41:39,980
my mom say, oh, Mary joy said, come
and see her. And then instantly I knew,

1841
01:41:40,370 --> 01:41:44,850
I knew what it was. Instantly. So I go
over there and I was like, you know,

1842
01:41:45,300 --> 01:41:48,200
got my head down, you know, all of stuff
because this lady is like my Auntie,

1843
01:41:48,430 --> 01:41:51,020
you know,
we grew up next to her and then she says,

1844
01:41:51,140 --> 01:41:54,500
I got your bag in the room
whenever you get ready for it,

1845
01:41:54,501 --> 01:41:55,530
just tell me to bring a tape.

1846
01:41:58,180 --> 01:41:59,350
Whoa.

1847
01:41:59,580 --> 01:42:03,540
So you know when I go get the bag and
then the next day I have guys to come over

1848
01:42:03,600 --> 01:42:07,660
and do like a $5,000 paint job on
her house, you know, and you know,

1849
01:42:07,740 --> 01:42:08,573
paint that house.

1850
01:42:09,240 --> 01:42:11,930
Nice. That's a smart
way to handle it, man.

1851
01:42:11,931 --> 01:42:14,830
That's the diplomatic way of
keeping the community happy.

1852
01:42:14,930 --> 01:42:18,580
Yeah. You got to [inaudible] and
that was a kind of good goodwill.

1853
01:42:18,581 --> 01:42:19,400
And I got in my,

1854
01:42:19,400 --> 01:42:23,050
in my neighborhood now she was anti
drugs because her daughter was,

1855
01:42:23,051 --> 01:42:26,360
was on drugs and was on drugs
before I started selling drugs.

1856
01:42:26,361 --> 01:42:29,930
Her daughter used to be on
PCP and ooze all strung out,

1857
01:42:30,080 --> 01:42:35,080
but she respected what I did and she
allowed me to conduct my business in her

1858
01:42:35,871 --> 01:42:40,700
neighborhood. What's, aren't
I rented respectfully to,
you know, it wasn't, no guns,

1859
01:42:41,180 --> 01:42:44,480
wasn't no gang bangers. Well, nobody
gonna get robbed over there. You know,

1860
01:42:44,510 --> 01:42:46,820
I made sure that you're not going
to come over here doing no Robin.

1861
01:42:47,210 --> 01:42:51,810
How did you keep it so civil? How, I mean,
how did you avoid the normal pitfall?

1862
01:42:52,050 --> 01:42:55,440
Well, I was willing to do
whatever it took. You know,
I was the police around here.

1863
01:42:55,800 --> 01:43:00,280
I police my neighborhood.
Wow. You know, you, you do
something around here, you know,

1864
01:43:00,300 --> 01:43:01,320
I'm a,
I'm gonna deal with you.

1865
01:43:02,480 --> 01:43:05,150
That's amazing.
Like how much of an area did you control?

1866
01:43:06,570 --> 01:43:09,420
Uh,
Los Angeles at one.

1867
01:43:13,570 --> 01:43:14,403
I mean,
you know,

1868
01:43:14,830 --> 01:43:18,640
it was a time man, when the, when
it started instead of the Christian,

1869
01:43:18,641 --> 01:43:21,810
blessed would get into it and they would
come and report to me. Man, you know,

1870
01:43:21,820 --> 01:43:25,300
those guys did such and such and
we're going to retaliate out. Hold Up,

1871
01:43:25,330 --> 01:43:30,220
let me go talk to him. Wow. So, you know,
and a lot of my guys said it that I really

1872
01:43:31,720 --> 01:43:33,730
put on the first peace treaty,
you know,

1873
01:43:33,731 --> 01:43:36,940
because for the first
time that we ever saw man,

1874
01:43:36,941 --> 01:43:41,110
it was crips and bloods selling
drugs on the same streets. Wow.

1875
01:43:42,380 --> 01:43:45,400
And I mean, you know, money money
will make you work together, you know,

1876
01:43:45,401 --> 01:43:46,170
money making,

1877
01:43:46,170 --> 01:43:50,540
how it brought the crips and the
bloods together. The, the, the, the,

1878
01:43:50,541 --> 01:43:52,190
the timing.
When Rodney King

1879
01:43:52,190 --> 01:43:54,870
happened, that's what brought
them together. Rodney King. Yeah.

1880
01:43:54,890 --> 01:43:58,640
But they w they had been working
together before that they had sold drugs

1881
01:43:58,641 --> 01:44:02,390
together. CRIPS and bloods had
sold drugs together in April.

1882
01:44:02,790 --> 01:44:04,860
Oh, I see. In Rodney King,

1883
01:44:04,890 --> 01:44:09,890
he recently pass away something drug drug
related wasn't any trout or something

1884
01:44:10,171 --> 01:44:13,620
like that. Got Too high. I don't know.
I don't remember what it was. Yeah.

1885
01:44:13,621 --> 01:44:17,190
That's what I had read this in
the system and a lot of stuff.

1886
01:44:18,180 --> 01:44:20,130
It's amazing that, uh, that,

1887
01:44:20,131 --> 01:44:23,610
that sorta opened up people's eyes
to what the fuck could happen.

1888
01:44:23,611 --> 01:44:26,730
You get pulled over by the
police like a lot of times people

1889
01:44:28,620 --> 01:44:33,300
stories. Yeah. Got It. I
got this experience it.

1890
01:44:33,301 --> 01:44:38,240
See all these cars in my faith. That's
flashlight therapy, baby shit. Yeah.

1891
01:44:38,270 --> 01:44:42,720
I didn't have the dog bite me up
while I was handcuffed. Oh God.

1892
01:44:42,721 --> 01:44:46,280
I got the boot marks in my back.
You know where they stump me and

1893
01:44:47,790 --> 01:44:48,481
I haven't been through it.

1894
01:44:48,481 --> 01:44:52,230
I was Rodney king like four or
five years before Rodney King.

1895
01:44:52,430 --> 01:44:55,160
Most people who have
never seen that before.

1896
01:44:55,161 --> 01:44:59,720
Rodney king had no idea that that could
go on unless you saw like the video from

1897
01:45:00,020 --> 01:45:04,340
the Chicago. Uh, was it the Democratic
convention in the 60s where they,

1898
01:45:04,341 --> 01:45:07,910
the cops beat the fuck out of those
kids. Yeah. There was, uh, some,

1899
01:45:07,911 --> 01:45:10,220
some convention in the 60s where the cops,

1900
01:45:10,221 --> 01:45:13,340
she has beat the fuck out
of these kids with clubs.

1901
01:45:13,341 --> 01:45:17,030
And it was horrific because it was on TV
and people got to see it for the first

1902
01:45:17,031 --> 01:45:17,661
time when the news,

1903
01:45:17,661 --> 01:45:21,200
it was before Kent State when they
shot those kids who were protesting the

1904
01:45:21,201 --> 01:45:25,490
Vietnam war. And it was, um,
it was one of the first times,

1905
01:45:25,491 --> 01:45:28,490
but then the Rodney king one
was like a recent one, you know,

1906
01:45:28,491 --> 01:45:29,760
it wasn't the news doing it.

1907
01:45:29,761 --> 01:45:32,660
It was one of the first ones
where people with a camera,

1908
01:45:32,900 --> 01:45:37,250
because the whole camera thing was like
a fairly new thing or a regular person

1909
01:45:37,251 --> 01:45:40,490
would have a video camera before you
would have to be a guy likes making movies

1910
01:45:40,491 --> 01:45:41,324
or some shit.

1911
01:45:41,630 --> 01:45:45,200
But it got to the point where the
technology got to the look of the common

1912
01:45:45,201 --> 01:45:47,690
person could have a video
camera and then boom,

1913
01:45:48,080 --> 01:45:49,580
they could catch someone doing something.

1914
01:45:50,210 --> 01:45:51,360
Got Guys in south central,

1915
01:45:51,361 --> 01:45:55,890
they got little cameras that they strapped
to their chest and walk around with

1916
01:45:55,891 --> 01:45:59,610
it. And uh, I forgot what they call them,
but uh, they have them on all the time.

1917
01:45:59,700 --> 01:46:03,070
All the time. That's the way they
keep the police. I'll call Brian.

1918
01:46:03,090 --> 01:46:07,560
Brian has glasses, I have glasses
and a pen. It looks like a big pen,

1919
01:46:07,590 --> 01:46:11,190
but it's like does the HD, oh yeah,
you can just set it down, you know,

1920
01:46:11,210 --> 01:46:12,440
and record HD and

1921
01:46:12,660 --> 01:46:14,280
yeah,
they have that spy shop would,

1922
01:46:14,281 --> 01:46:18,090
that's all they specialize in like shit
that you can like wear hats and stuff

1923
01:46:18,091 --> 01:46:20,850
that film and things along those lines.

1924
01:46:21,030 --> 01:46:22,300
Yeah. I was with, uh, with a,

1925
01:46:22,310 --> 01:46:24,840
with a guy the other night and he
had this thing and I was like, man,

1926
01:46:24,841 --> 01:46:27,150
what's that on your chest? He
said, well that's my police camera.

1927
01:46:28,890 --> 01:46:30,480
He said they can't cut it off either.

1928
01:46:31,110 --> 01:46:33,630
Cops got busted recently
slamming some girl on the ground,

1929
01:46:33,690 --> 01:46:38,220
picked her up and slammed her twice.
She got pulled over though. No.

1930
01:46:38,370 --> 01:46:42,760
Which he got pulled over for a, um, a
cell phone ticket. That's it. Wow. Yeah.

1931
01:46:42,990 --> 01:46:47,820
Oh my God. Oh, the cell phone thing. Oh my
God. This cell phone tickets or you know,

1932
01:46:47,821 --> 01:46:50,640
they, they're, they're
saying that like a, like $120

1933
01:46:50,640 --> 01:46:54,480
but everyone I know that has got
one. It's been like 800, $900.

1934
01:46:55,020 --> 01:46:56,970
Why is it that one? Quite a few. Yeah.

1935
01:46:56,971 --> 01:47:00,120
Like there's all these extra
bullshit charges to it. And

1936
01:47:01,980 --> 01:47:04,260
I guess that's why they slammed
into the ground. It was $800.

1937
01:47:07,660 --> 01:47:11,640
That's ridiculous. Hey, up the enforcer,
I think cops are used to doing that.

1938
01:47:11,641 --> 01:47:13,350
I think they've been doing that
since the beginning of time.

1939
01:47:13,590 --> 01:47:16,050
Have you heard of that one comp that
they found in Florida that might be a

1940
01:47:16,051 --> 01:47:20,430
serial killer with the wife? No.
Different guy. I know that guy too.

1941
01:47:20,460 --> 01:47:25,460
But another guy who pulled over
to a separate people said yeah.

1942
01:47:25,501 --> 01:47:27,760
Said he brought them to
the SARC. Okay. And uh,

1943
01:47:27,810 --> 01:47:30,480
dropped him out and then
there's no video at the circle.

1944
01:47:30,481 --> 01:47:33,390
K The security camera does
not show him or the guy there,

1945
01:47:33,391 --> 01:47:36,450
there's no evidence of him making
calls that he allegedly makes.

1946
01:47:36,810 --> 01:47:40,980
And he also runs like searches on these
people and says that he doesn't even

1947
01:47:40,981 --> 01:47:44,130
know who they are. Like I don't even
remember meeting anybody. Like, I dunno,

1948
01:47:44,190 --> 01:47:47,640
like you said it like three different
stories. I found the car abandoned that.

1949
01:47:47,641 --> 01:47:49,560
Like he's got all these different stories,
but meanwhile,

1950
01:47:49,920 --> 01:47:53,760
both guys are completely off the
face of the earth. They vanished.

1951
01:47:53,970 --> 01:47:57,150
And there's just people that he just
pulled over for speeding or for whatever,

1952
01:47:57,720 --> 01:48:02,490
or Morgan. Yeah. There's some guys like
his mom was like interviewing. She's like,

1953
01:48:02,850 --> 01:48:06,090
he would definitely call me if he was
alive. I was like, yes, I heard that.

1954
01:48:06,091 --> 01:48:08,300
That was what was exactly the Latino.
Yeah.

1955
01:48:08,470 --> 01:48:10,140
The Latino guy didn't even speak English.

1956
01:48:10,141 --> 01:48:12,540
They were both from Mexico and
him and his brother were set up.

1957
01:48:12,550 --> 01:48:15,090
Bray, the cop took his brother, so
he's going to drop him off at circle.

1958
01:48:15,091 --> 01:48:19,350
Tastes just kill this motherfucker.
Just probably, who knows? You know?

1959
01:48:19,351 --> 01:48:22,460
I think they, I think
human beings when they, we,

1960
01:48:22,510 --> 01:48:24,120
they get into a position of power,

1961
01:48:24,150 --> 01:48:29,150
they lose objectivity and they start
looking at it as an US versus them thing.

1962
01:48:29,401 --> 01:48:29,900
You know?

1963
01:48:29,900 --> 01:48:31,070
Especially, I don't know, Joe,

1964
01:48:31,071 --> 01:48:34,440
I think that's a pessimistic view a
little bit because I look at Rick and I

1965
01:48:34,490 --> 01:48:38,180
think that one of the aspirational parts
of him is that he got into power and he

1966
01:48:38,181 --> 01:48:40,280
shared it.
I mean everyone.

1967
01:48:40,390 --> 01:48:43,960
Sure. But I think for the most part,
that is how people behave. I mean,

1968
01:48:43,961 --> 01:48:47,260
that's how cops behave. It's not every
cop that behaves like that. Obviously.

1969
01:48:47,261 --> 01:48:50,650
I know a lot of good cops, especially
from a Jujitsu, from martial arts.

1970
01:48:50,890 --> 01:48:53,470
I'm always around cops and I know
a lot of them that are really cool.

1971
01:48:53,650 --> 01:48:56,380
But I know a lot of cops there
cons, you know, and it's just,

1972
01:48:56,381 --> 01:49:00,160
it just is what it is. And then I think
the ones like the serial killer guy,

1973
01:49:00,430 --> 01:49:03,880
you know, and the, the ones like the guy
who slams those people on the ground,

1974
01:49:04,090 --> 01:49:07,600
I mean those, those guys
exist, you know, it's a,

1975
01:49:07,780 --> 01:49:10,700
and they have absolute power.
Yeah.

1976
01:49:10,920 --> 01:49:13,750
But how about the fucking kid who was
handcuffed and shot himself in the back of

1977
01:49:13,751 --> 01:49:18,751
the head in the car and the police in
the back seat of a police car handcuffed.

1978
01:49:18,820 --> 01:49:20,290
They didn't find a gun on him,
but he had a gun.

1979
01:49:20,291 --> 01:49:23,590
So he pulls out the gun and
shoots himself in the head. Like,

1980
01:49:25,150 --> 01:49:29,230
like why? And I think it was for like a
DUI or something crazy. Right? It was,

1981
01:49:29,231 --> 01:49:32,490
it wasn't even like anything.
Not that serious. It wasn't
like he was going to go,

1982
01:49:32,740 --> 01:49:36,220
go to jail for the rest of his life.
Not that, you know, a DUI is a serious,

1983
01:49:36,221 --> 01:49:38,980
but I don't know if it's serious
enough to get you to kill yourself.

1984
01:49:39,640 --> 01:49:42,040
I should actually actually
say what the fuck that is.

1985
01:49:42,041 --> 01:49:44,050
I should actually Google that.

1986
01:49:46,120 --> 01:49:48,010
I saw cough,
I saw Louis C k last

1987
01:49:48,010 --> 01:49:52,510
night at the Improv and man, that guy
is rolling around like a rock star now.

1988
01:49:52,511 --> 01:49:56,680
He sold out two shows at the thing and
then went to the comedy store and sold

1989
01:49:56,681 --> 01:49:59,260
out the main room in 20,
like 20 minutes.

1990
01:49:59,370 --> 01:50:02,580
Yeah. And um, he had a midnight show
and I think he like sold the tickets,

1991
01:50:02,990 --> 01:50:07,670
cash only cash only. It's
hilarious. And, and wow man,

1992
01:50:07,700 --> 01:50:11,690
all new material. Uh, how was it?
I wasn't even allowed in the room.

1993
01:50:11,691 --> 01:50:13,340
That's how crazy packed it was.

1994
01:50:13,580 --> 01:50:16,520
I couldn't even look in the room
at the comedy store, which is, if,

1995
01:50:16,521 --> 01:50:18,740
you know the comments are your yeah,
you're a regular,

1996
01:50:18,760 --> 01:50:22,040
you usually can like sit in the
back or like look in the back.

1997
01:50:22,220 --> 01:50:24,530
Couldn't even do that was to pack.
That's amazing.

1998
01:50:24,620 --> 01:50:26,720
But everyone said it was amazing shows.

1999
01:50:27,250 --> 01:50:31,630
Yeah. He asked me for him to
go, but I was too tired. Um,

2000
01:50:32,050 --> 01:50:35,830
I'm trying to find out what this kid did.
Uh,

2001
01:50:37,210 --> 01:50:39,730
they're just this, this, I
don't want to keep looking,

2002
01:50:39,850 --> 01:50:44,590
but the whole thing is crazy like that
a person could handcuff, handcuff,

2003
01:50:44,591 --> 01:50:46,030
shoot themselves in the temple.

2004
01:50:46,890 --> 01:50:49,810
Joe Does. Part of that is the
danger of this, of this wraparound.

2005
01:50:49,890 --> 01:50:54,000
We did an article on Luke 21,
uh, called, uh, uh, Rick Ross,

2006
01:50:54,080 --> 01:50:55,620
a hip hop's war against black men.

2007
01:50:56,090 --> 01:50:59,190
When we really talk about the danger
I've putting out these perpetual criminal

2008
01:50:59,191 --> 01:51:01,140
black man images and,
uh,

2009
01:51:01,170 --> 01:51:04,860
we look more at Trayvon at that
time and just discuss the reality.

2010
01:51:05,160 --> 01:51:09,750
And this is an interview of me and Rick
and we discussed the reality of when you

2011
01:51:09,751 --> 01:51:13,890
put that image out, how it creates
fearmongering not only amongst the cops,

2012
01:51:13,891 --> 01:51:15,920
but also regular citizens like Zimmerman.

2013
01:51:16,740 --> 01:51:20,430
People just have that already in their
head when they, when they see the CDC, uh,

2014
01:51:20,460 --> 01:51:24,330
Trayvon with the IC walking home.
Absolutely insane.

2015
01:51:24,660 --> 01:51:28,890
Yeah. It's the, the
perpetual, um, criminal image.

2016
01:51:29,320 --> 01:51:33,240
It really in, in a, in like the
way it entered into white society.

2017
01:51:33,241 --> 01:51:37,650
It was a gangster rap and the 80s because
before that it's like there was never

2018
01:51:37,651 --> 01:51:41,760
any entertainers that would
brag about being criminals.

2019
01:51:41,790 --> 01:51:44,910
Like that shit didn't exist. No, it
never just sit and rock and roll.

2020
01:51:44,911 --> 01:51:49,820
There was a little bit of like a
shot a man in Reno just to watch him.

2021
01:51:50,280 --> 01:51:53,850
I mean that was about as crazy as it
got. You know, it never got like Nwa.

2022
01:51:53,851 --> 01:51:57,630
I mean I remember I was a kid and I was
listening to Nwa while I was on that I

2023
01:51:57,631 --> 01:51:59,760
was on a stair climber.
I was like,

2024
01:51:59,761 --> 01:52:01,830
this is the craziest Shit
I've ever listened to.

2025
01:52:01,831 --> 01:52:05,460
What the fuck they're saying like
this is nuts. Like they are just out.

2026
01:52:05,461 --> 01:52:08,910
And I was thinking, man, society's going
down the shitter. This is craziness.

2027
01:52:09,920 --> 01:52:11,160
And then you look at that cover and you,

2028
01:52:11,161 --> 01:52:14,200
you come back to the question that you
asked, why does he have to look like that?

2029
01:52:14,290 --> 01:52:14,560
Right.

2030
01:52:14,560 --> 01:52:18,130
Was that the whole photo shoot or was
that just the craziest shot that they

2031
01:52:18,131 --> 01:52:20,440
found in the photo shoot?
At least he doesn't have a gun on him.

2032
01:52:20,500 --> 01:52:24,460
And this is not like holding up diamond
crusted gun. Pulled up your pants

2033
01:52:26,240 --> 01:52:29,610
sagging thing man.
And just take a nice picture.

2034
01:52:29,770 --> 01:52:34,770
You take a nice picture for [inaudible]
to own mills fucking underwear photo

2035
01:52:35,621 --> 01:52:39,640
look in his underwear. It's so silly.
What that picture is is I don't care.

2036
01:52:39,670 --> 01:52:43,210
But they do have a picture of him
in his uniform and his book and his

2037
01:52:43,220 --> 01:52:46,000
correctional officer uniform.
I'll do that. Brilliant. Yeah, I'm

2038
01:52:46,010 --> 01:52:50,570
going get his award. You know he was the
best CEO at the, at the academy. The best.

2039
01:52:50,680 --> 01:52:52,730
What do you have to do to be
the best perfect attendance?

2040
01:52:53,060 --> 01:52:56,540
That's what you got to war for. Uh,
get a guy that got an extra stamp,

2041
01:52:56,541 --> 01:53:00,440
an extra scoop you up.
There's a picture of him.

2042
01:53:00,650 --> 01:53:05,210
I got his girlfriend too long on a visit
and you bust his ass and put him in the

2043
01:53:05,211 --> 01:53:08,060
hall. Is that what he does?
Or a rapping over there.

2044
01:53:08,061 --> 01:53:12,360
And then you break up the wrap
group and it's still all the lyrics.

2045
01:53:12,361 --> 01:53:16,460
So give me all those papers you think
he's told lyrics from people too. Oh,

2046
01:53:16,461 --> 01:53:18,950
absolutely. For sure. Yeah. He
doesn't write his own music.

2047
01:53:18,951 --> 01:53:22,970
Is there a lot of rappers in jail that
are talented guys that are stolen? Yeah.

2048
01:53:23,530 --> 01:53:27,680
Guys in jail got stories. You know
they, they, they, they, they been here.

2049
01:53:33,470 --> 01:53:36,830
Yeah,
and you see it live.

2050
01:53:37,550 --> 01:53:41,850
That is so ridiculous.
It's so strange.

2051
01:53:42,330 --> 01:53:45,060
The DECA, why didn't you put down
on the coast? Look at the cover.

2052
01:53:46,450 --> 01:53:47,480
It's two different people.

2053
01:53:47,900 --> 01:53:52,010
It's two different people that beer
does look like Ali gene, the dictator.

2054
01:53:55,870 --> 01:53:58,810
Brian, see if he can pull up
anything about his beard. I try.

2055
01:53:58,820 --> 01:54:03,620
I tried looking for it. Yeah, I
did. Shit looks fake. It's fake.

2056
01:54:03,680 --> 01:54:06,590
Even if it's not fake, who
cares? The whole thing is silly.

2057
01:54:06,591 --> 01:54:07,820
It's silly and ridiculous.

2058
01:54:08,290 --> 01:54:09,070
Listen man,

2059
01:54:09,070 --> 01:54:13,120
I hope the one thing that we got out of
this podcast is we started the Rick Ross

2060
01:54:13,121 --> 01:54:15,520
podcast.
That's what you need to do and by the way,

2061
01:54:15,760 --> 01:54:20,760
just call it the Rick Ross podcast and
this fool is going to get you millions of

2062
01:54:20,831 --> 01:54:23,080
listeners almost immediately,

2063
01:54:23,200 --> 01:54:27,340
and you could spell it out at
the beginning of every podcast.

2064
01:54:27,440 --> 01:54:29,230
Just nice and clean and simple.

2065
01:54:29,380 --> 01:54:33,460
If you're going to this podcast thinking
that it's Rick Ross, the wrapper,

2066
01:54:33,640 --> 01:54:37,750
you been misled. It says though,
Real Rick Ross that Rick Ross,

2067
01:54:37,751 --> 01:54:41,050
the wrapper ripped his name off from,
you know why?

2068
01:54:41,140 --> 01:54:44,530
Because I was one of the most successful
drug dealers in the history of the

2069
01:54:44,531 --> 01:54:47,530
United States and I went to jail and he
thought it was going to Jeff for life,

2070
01:54:47,560 --> 01:54:51,940
but I learned how to read in jail and
I got out because I found a hole in the

2071
01:54:51,941 --> 01:54:56,020
fucking case. And now here I am
on the Rick Ross podcast. Boom.

2072
01:54:56,050 --> 01:54:57,430
That's the beginning of every episode.

2073
01:54:57,640 --> 01:55:00,580
They would listen to that and then
every kid who had listened to it,

2074
01:55:00,581 --> 01:55:03,550
who was probably a Rick Ross
Fan, the fake guy, the rapper,

2075
01:55:03,700 --> 01:55:05,290
we'll listen to that first couple seconds,

2076
01:55:05,320 --> 01:55:09,010
just you saying if you thought this
was Rick Ross the rapper, nope.

2077
01:55:09,011 --> 01:55:12,880
This is the dude that Rick Ross stole his
fucking name from the real rich people

2078
01:55:12,881 --> 01:55:14,680
would be like,
what stole his name?

2079
01:55:14,830 --> 01:55:18,160
Then they get out their phones and
start googling shit. That alone

2080
01:55:19,120 --> 01:55:22,390
might take this dude down or
at least get them to pay. Yeah,

2081
01:55:24,290 --> 01:55:26,540
I mean we,
every time he comes out with something,

2082
01:55:26,570 --> 01:55:28,130
if you really search the Internet,

2083
01:55:28,220 --> 01:55:31,400
like that rolling stone article
came out on that Friday. Right.

2084
01:55:31,760 --> 01:55:35,950
And we did a release a
letter, uh, Rick, uh, Rick,

2085
01:55:36,060 --> 01:55:39,710
Rick and I sat down and I got his ideas
and we did a letter and for the whole

2086
01:55:39,711 --> 01:55:42,890
weekend when you searched

Okay. All right. I'll Google.

2094
01:56:04,050 --> 01:56:08,490
The whole thing is crazy.
And the whole America is crazy though.

2095
01:56:08,590 --> 01:56:13,380
America is crazy. It's definitely
bizarre. You got a phone call and make

2096
01:56:16,160 --> 01:56:18,670
Oh, okay. The fake beard
thing. That's funny. He's,

2097
01:56:18,680 --> 01:56:22,260
he's determined to let the world
know about this fake beard thing.

2098
01:56:23,990 --> 01:56:27,750
Trademark trademark beard as well.

2099
01:56:27,780 --> 01:56:31,200
The name's not enough.
You've got to him and got a fake beard.

2100
01:56:31,230 --> 01:56:35,280
If you find out that Baird is fake,
that is so key. You fend to see.

2101
01:56:36,030 --> 01:56:39,960
I haven't just that
statement you fin to see.

2102
01:56:40,780 --> 01:56:45,330
Oh Man, I can't wait. I can't wait to
see it. God, I hope it's really good.

2103
01:56:45,680 --> 01:56:48,990
Do you find it Brian?
You know what to search for now?

2104
01:56:50,730 --> 01:56:55,410
Oh Gosh. Like beard. Come on son.

2105
01:56:55,411 --> 01:56:58,480
That's ridiculous. That's going to
be the wrap, right? It's ridiculous.

2106
01:56:58,500 --> 01:57:01,740
The Internet levels,
the whole playing field in terms of like,

2107
01:57:02,040 --> 01:57:05,580
even if if mass media doesn't want to
cover certain things with the Internet

2108
01:57:05,581 --> 01:57:10,560
allows us to do is is immediately
put pressure through. Oh Wow.

2109
01:57:10,650 --> 01:57:15,170
When did you notice the
most? The most. That's fine.

2110
01:57:15,750 --> 01:57:20,450
Is that him? That's not him. That's
how you do it. I guess how you,

2111
01:57:20,520 --> 01:57:24,120
that's how the style of how you do it, how
you fill it in. Oh, we'll go to him, man.

2112
01:57:24,121 --> 01:57:25,640
That's fine. Him. This
is just a dude getting,

2113
01:57:25,650 --> 01:57:26,930
I think this is what
they're talking about.

2114
01:57:26,940 --> 01:57:30,240
Know what they're saying is how you fill
it in and do it if it isn't coming in

2115
01:57:30,241 --> 01:57:33,280
all together. Oh, okay.
Once you go to it. Yeah.

2116
01:57:34,570 --> 01:57:37,370
We got to see him do it though.
I don't think they have him.

2117
01:57:41,030 --> 01:57:45,900
Oh, there's no, there's no actual
Rick Ross footage of him getting this.

2118
01:57:46,020 --> 01:57:49,710
No, no, no. Okay. Damn.
We're just speculating.

2119
01:57:50,370 --> 01:57:53,050
That's not good enough.
Yeah.

2120
01:57:53,800 --> 01:57:57,120
We got to find out the actual facts.
We can't just talk shit on the dude.

2121
01:57:57,300 --> 01:58:00,910
This is enough shit to talk
shit on anyway. I mean, how is,

2122
01:58:01,050 --> 01:58:02,330
how is this guy sad?

2123
01:58:02,590 --> 01:58:06,640
This they're putting paste
on his face like that.

2124
01:58:06,650 --> 01:58:09,960
That spirit gum that you use for like
fake mustaches and it looks like,

2125
01:58:09,961 --> 01:58:14,780
which is like a really sticky oh man. Use
it on their head. Yeah. Glue and then,

2126
01:58:15,060 --> 01:58:19,740
then it looks like they're not there.
They're gluing hair on this false face.

2127
01:58:19,770 --> 01:58:24,540
Oh Wow. This is not just it like
the, the, the spray on, Oh shit.

2128
01:58:24,840 --> 01:58:29,030
This is like fake actual
hairs are in there. Oh,

2129
01:58:29,160 --> 01:58:33,920
this is crazy. Oh, that's disgusting.
That's exactly how it looks.

2130
01:58:34,170 --> 01:58:38,100
That's exactly how he does it though. I
mean it's, but look how stupid that looks.

2131
01:58:38,160 --> 01:58:42,040
Who would want a beard? It
looks like that a superhero. All

2132
01:58:42,090 --> 01:58:42,480
right.

2133
01:58:42,480 --> 01:58:47,100
Yeah. That's like a wax
figure. It looks so weird.

2134
01:58:47,220 --> 01:58:51,920
So weird. I got booger.
That is a very strong,

2135
01:58:51,930 --> 01:58:54,760
you get a perfect a perfect beer.
That's a strange thing to do.

2136
01:58:54,761 --> 01:58:58,540
What your fucking time. I don't
even want my perfect no more. Yeah,

2137
01:58:58,541 --> 01:59:01,410
you're better off.
That looks like look like madness.

2138
01:59:01,770 --> 01:59:02,880
That looks like a crazy person.

2139
01:59:02,881 --> 01:59:06,210
Like he's determined to get that
shit perfectly smooth. Creepy.

2140
01:59:07,530 --> 01:59:09,510
What is the best thing
that's come out of this man?

2141
01:59:10,570 --> 01:59:14,110
Well, I'm out of my whole life.

2142
01:59:14,111 --> 01:59:19,111
The best thing that's come out now is
that I'm able to go back and tell kids the

2143
01:59:20,051 --> 01:59:20,884
real story.

2144
01:59:20,950 --> 01:59:25,810
You know how a person can go
from being a tennis player,

2145
01:59:26,590 --> 01:59:30,830
uh, to selling drugs. You know,
almost overnight. You know,

2146
01:59:30,850 --> 01:59:34,960
one day I was a tennis player and
the next day I'm a drug dealer.

2147
01:59:36,240 --> 01:59:37,073
Um,

2148
01:59:37,150 --> 01:59:42,150
so it's not like they tell you that this
big mean monster's going to come down

2149
01:59:43,901 --> 01:59:45,340
and you start you to selling drugs.

2150
01:59:46,030 --> 01:59:47,890
One of my best friends
called me selling drugs.

2151
01:59:48,340 --> 01:59:52,780
He showed me cocaine from our first time.
He explained, he explained it to me.

2152
01:59:53,230 --> 01:59:54,760
Uh,
he sold me on the idea.

2153
01:59:55,360 --> 01:59:59,410
And what I think is so important
that these kids, you know,

2154
01:59:59,411 --> 02:00:04,260
that that's how you're going
to get introduced to drugs,
not by some stranger, uh,

2155
02:00:04,690 --> 02:00:06,070
not from Rick Ross.

2156
02:00:06,071 --> 02:00:09,520
The drug dealers not going to come down
and introduce you to drugs, you know,

2157
02:00:09,521 --> 02:00:10,840
it's going to be somebody close to you.

2158
02:00:11,200 --> 02:00:15,880
So I think with me using my
experience and my story to,

2159
02:00:16,030 --> 02:00:18,550
to educate the world, you
know, I believe that, that,

2160
02:00:18,551 --> 02:00:22,900
that we definitely need educating. And,
um, that's what I'm doing now. You know,

2161
02:00:22,901 --> 02:00:27,070
we're doing a documentary called crack
in the system. Uh, we still underfunded.

2162
02:00:27,380 --> 02:00:30,300
Don't know what Mark Levin,
Mark Levin has done.

2163
02:00:30,360 --> 02:00:34,950
HBL director who just did a prayer for
a perfect season and uh, last on long,

2164
02:00:34,970 --> 02:00:38,150
I didn't, hard times. It's nominated
for some Emmys. We expect to be,

2165
02:00:38,250 --> 02:00:41,220
we expect to get some Oscar nods on
this documentary. It's that powerful.

2166
02:00:41,310 --> 02:00:44,670
There's so many different
facets and phases of your life.

2167
02:00:44,671 --> 02:00:47,050
It's so interesting to
have your, you know, uh,

2168
02:00:47,060 --> 02:00:52,020
run in Los Angeles phase to
being incarcerated with no
hope of escaping phase to

2169
02:00:52,021 --> 02:00:55,890
figuring out how to read phase
to now educating kids phase.

2170
02:00:56,310 --> 02:00:58,860
This is a, I mean, what is the,

2171
02:00:58,861 --> 02:01:01,800
what is it like to be at
this phase of your life now?

2172
02:01:01,830 --> 02:01:05,520
Like reflecting back on all the
madness of the previous phases.

2173
02:01:06,380 --> 02:01:08,500
It's like, wow, you know, uh,

2174
02:01:08,780 --> 02:01:12,680
this is what you had to go through to
become who you are today. You know,

2175
02:01:12,681 --> 02:01:15,920
had I not went through
all those scenarios,

2176
02:01:15,921 --> 02:01:19,700
had I not been bitten by the dog,
beaten in the head with flashlights,

2177
02:01:19,701 --> 02:01:21,650
had drugs planning on you by the police,

2178
02:01:22,310 --> 02:01:27,310
could I be able to rationalize all of
the things that I ration with right now?

2179
02:01:27,610 --> 02:01:28,340
You know,

2180
02:01:28,340 --> 02:01:32,150
being able to sit in prison with a
guy that you gave his first drug too,

2181
02:01:32,810 --> 02:01:36,230
and he has a life sentence.
And at one time we both got lights,

2182
02:01:36,250 --> 02:01:37,550
him life sentences.
You know,

2183
02:01:37,551 --> 02:01:41,210
this guy wanted to be like me
so that he not only copied me,

2184
02:01:41,211 --> 02:01:44,150
but he also went to prison with me,
had a life sentence with me.

2185
02:01:44,151 --> 02:01:48,290
We walked the track and then I have to
walk when I walked out of prison to leave

2186
02:01:48,291 --> 02:01:49,850
him there.
Uh,

2187
02:01:51,020 --> 02:01:53,600
all these things shaped
me for who I am today.

2188
02:01:53,930 --> 02:01:58,930
And I believe that that's what gives
me the ability to be able to walk in a

2189
02:01:59,631 --> 02:02:04,631
board room with an Ori Manual
or Jeff Bird or Michael Lynton.

2190
02:02:05,660 --> 02:02:09,260
And then I can leave from there and go
to south central watts and go to Jordan

2191
02:02:09,261 --> 02:02:11,990
high school and sit there
and talk to the kids.

2192
02:02:12,640 --> 02:02:17,230
How many dudes get out after long
stretches like that and they become

2193
02:02:17,231 --> 02:02:19,870
institutionalized and they
can't take the regular world.

2194
02:02:20,810 --> 02:02:23,960
I think it's, it's, it's, it's
a lot. I mean, even myself,

2195
02:02:23,961 --> 02:02:26,690
I was institutionalized when
I was in prison. I mean,

2196
02:02:26,691 --> 02:02:31,160
because I function in prison,
uh, at a high level, you know,

2197
02:02:31,190 --> 02:02:34,130
prison didn't affect me,
you know, like right now,

2198
02:02:34,131 --> 02:02:37,640
even when I got into it with my po and
he was talking about sending me back,

2199
02:02:38,060 --> 02:02:42,370
I was like, send me back for a year a
year. It's nothing I can do a year on,

2200
02:02:42,430 --> 02:02:44,270
on a handstand,
you know?

2201
02:02:44,271 --> 02:02:48,230
So I believe that it's very
easy to get institutionalized.

2202
02:02:48,290 --> 02:02:53,060
It's very easy to start to go with
the flow. Started to like being there,

2203
02:02:53,360 --> 02:02:58,010
uh, to, to, to say that the world on
the outside is not real. You know,

2204
02:02:58,011 --> 02:03:01,130
that being in here is what's
real. I mean, I had a friend,

2205
02:03:01,570 --> 02:03:03,080
I just heard a couple of weeks ago,

2206
02:03:03,081 --> 02:03:07,220
he did 20 years flat with me.

2207
02:03:07,221 --> 02:03:08,750
We started out at the same time.
Matter of fact,

2208
02:03:08,751 --> 02:03:11,360
he started out a little before I did.
And uh,

2209
02:03:12,800 --> 02:03:16,960
before that he did juvenile hall and
had been incarcerated orders night with

2210
02:03:16,961 --> 02:03:20,680
just the other week. He went and did
one of the stupidest crimes that,

2211
02:03:20,740 --> 02:03:23,210
that that you,
you can't believe it.

2212
02:03:23,211 --> 02:03:25,700
He almost had a life
sentence for crack cocaine.

2213
02:03:25,701 --> 02:03:29,270
He went and sold somebody two ounces
of crack cocaine out here. Uh,

2214
02:03:29,540 --> 02:03:34,250
and now he's back in jail and he's looking
at a life sentence all over again or

2215
02:03:34,550 --> 02:03:38,950
20 years. God Damn the, the guy,

2216
02:03:38,970 --> 02:03:42,020
that guy is intelligent.
It's kind graduated from college.

2217
02:03:42,220 --> 02:03:45,770
So while he was in prison, he went
to college. He got degrees. I mean,

2218
02:03:46,280 --> 02:03:48,350
just a brilliant guy.

2219
02:03:48,530 --> 02:03:52,330
But did he move right back home
to his own old stomping ground?

2220
02:03:52,760 --> 02:03:56,130
He had nowhere else to go. What was
he going to go? I mean, you know,

2221
02:03:56,131 --> 02:03:58,790
when you get out of jail, you do 20
years, you, you don't have anything.

2222
02:03:58,791 --> 02:04:00,530
You don't have many
body. I mean, you know,

2223
02:04:00,531 --> 02:04:03,540
he was lucky that his father
took him in and you know,

2224
02:04:03,560 --> 02:04:08,540
he just slid back in, you know,
to, to, to what he knew. You know,

2225
02:04:08,550 --> 02:04:12,050
I think drugs becomes like a
crutch for the seller. You know,

2226
02:04:12,051 --> 02:04:13,550
where if something goes wrong,

2227
02:04:13,880 --> 02:04:17,090
he knows how to fix it and that
should go out and sell him some drugs.

2228
02:04:17,091 --> 02:04:21,960
And you know, now I've got a place to
live. I got gas in my car, I'm eating. Uh,

2229
02:04:22,030 --> 02:04:23,370
I'm respectful again.
You know?

2230
02:04:23,930 --> 02:04:27,530
Did any of that could ever be
stopped? Is there a map? I mean,

2231
02:04:27,740 --> 02:04:32,740
you must've spent a lot of time thinking
about the whole system of illegal drug

2232
02:04:32,870 --> 02:04:37,190
trade and you know, what got you into
this? Is there a way to ever stop that?

2233
02:04:37,870 --> 02:04:41,740
Well, we're going to have to give real
opportunity, not fake opportunity.

2234
02:04:42,170 --> 02:04:43,003
Uh,

2235
02:04:43,450 --> 02:04:45,610
like so many people are selling right now.
You know,

2236
02:04:45,611 --> 02:04:49,990
so many people right now are selling us
fake opportunity when there's really no

2237
02:04:49,991 --> 02:04:52,300
opportunities. There's no
manufacturing jobs. You know,

2238
02:04:52,301 --> 02:04:56,260
they sent all our jobs overseas. I
mean, if you want to be a operator,

2239
02:04:56,560 --> 02:04:58,880
you got to go to India, you know? Uh,

2240
02:04:58,900 --> 02:05:03,900
so what we're going to have to do is
figure out how we can make our people feel

2241
02:05:04,241 --> 02:05:08,340
important. Again. How, how do
you make up a person feeling

2242
02:05:08,690 --> 02:05:12,780
Ken that stopped drugs though
cannot stop the sale of drugs.

2243
02:05:12,800 --> 02:05:15,090
And if drugs are illegal,

2244
02:05:15,630 --> 02:05:18,000
are they always going to be wanted?

2245
02:05:18,030 --> 02:05:20,790
Is it always going to be a market
for them that's a criminal market?

2246
02:05:21,180 --> 02:05:21,871
Absolutely.

2247
02:05:21,871 --> 02:05:26,130
I believe that the only way we can solve
this drug problem is with education.

2248
02:05:26,131 --> 02:05:29,910
Because like you said,
as long as there's a demand for drugs,

2249
02:05:30,150 --> 02:05:33,300
there's going to be a supplier.
Once we end the demand,

2250
02:05:34,280 --> 02:05:35,113
then

2251
02:05:35,610 --> 02:05:38,250
the suppliers are automatically go away
because they're not going to be standing

2252
02:05:38,251 --> 02:05:39,960
around holding drugs that nobody wants.

2253
02:05:40,120 --> 02:05:43,720
Right. So we gotta educate people.
That's a high level of education.

2254
02:05:43,730 --> 02:05:46,720
The point where they don't want drugs
cause even this motherfucker loves drugs.

2255
02:05:47,440 --> 02:05:48,273
He's always good.

2256
02:05:49,910 --> 02:05:51,770
There's one thing inside
of what Rick is saying,

2257
02:05:51,771 --> 02:05:55,310
it's very powerful and we got to
realize that when the seller is selling,

2258
02:05:55,340 --> 02:05:59,240
his drug isn't only the money,
it's the power and the respect.

2259
02:05:59,660 --> 02:06:03,200
And if you can find an alternate way for
that person that I'm not saying get the

2260
02:06:03,201 --> 02:06:05,630
same level of respect but be respected,

2261
02:06:05,900 --> 02:06:08,960
then you can give them an alternate
route that isn't as dangerous.

2262
02:06:08,961 --> 02:06:12,080
They might choose that over
the extra money. Oh for sure.

2263
02:06:12,520 --> 02:06:17,520
Well everybody would more certainly
choose a Karma free form of success over

2264
02:06:18,551 --> 02:06:22,180
success. It involves like real dangerous
shit and going to jail, getting shot.

2265
02:06:22,690 --> 02:06:26,980
It's just a, how do we get people to
aspire that high? I mean we gotta,

2266
02:06:27,010 --> 02:06:31,780
we gotta do a lot of work on the
culture of this country, of the,

2267
02:06:31,781 --> 02:06:35,380
just the way we, just, the
way we raise human beings.

2268
02:06:35,620 --> 02:06:40,210
I mean all of this from sneaky to this
ridiculous nonsense that we feed each

2269
02:06:40,211 --> 02:06:41,310
other. It's like, oh,

2270
02:06:41,830 --> 02:06:45,820
it's okay if it's just you at the
airport picking it up and laughing.

2271
02:06:46,090 --> 02:06:50,530
But it's the people that actually get
influenced by that influenced by this Ding

2272
02:06:50,530 --> 02:06:54,100
Dong culture of nonsense
and fake drug sales and,

2273
02:06:54,101 --> 02:06:57,580
and fake shooting people. It's
like what, what are we promoting?

2274
02:06:57,581 --> 02:07:01,150
Like what the fuck are we doing?
Is it just a, a mad money grab

2275
02:07:01,780 --> 02:07:05,440
responsibility? Exactly. I mean
they don't have any responsibility.

2276
02:07:05,441 --> 02:07:09,010
I think that if you allow a magazine,

2277
02:07:09,520 --> 02:07:12,190
they put a guy in here who sent in.
I sell drugs.

2278
02:07:12,990 --> 02:07:13,470
Okay.

2279
02:07:13,470 --> 02:07:15,510
They should be held accountable for that.
I mean,

2280
02:07:15,511 --> 02:07:18,630
cause all I did and selling drugs. Let
me tell you what I did in selling drugs.

2281
02:07:18,631 --> 02:07:22,040
Really. Cause I, you know, I didn't
manufacture the drugs. Right?

2282
02:07:22,230 --> 02:07:26,160
All I did was got the drugs from
one guy and hand him to another guy.

2283
02:07:27,080 --> 02:07:27,740
Okay.

2284
02:07:27,740 --> 02:07:31,250
So if you handing off drug information,
you should,

2285
02:07:31,251 --> 02:07:33,080
you should be liable for
that type of inflammation.

2286
02:07:33,081 --> 02:07:36,040
If you putting out records
where you telling kids to go

2287
02:07:36,040 --> 02:07:40,120
out and sell drugs to parlay that
into a record. It's funny, outlandish,

2288
02:07:40,450 --> 02:07:42,910
but like when we look at Nwa,
you talked about him earlier.

2289
02:07:43,060 --> 02:07:46,270
The FBI went after Nwa when cops
started getting shot up after,

2290
02:07:46,271 --> 02:07:50,590
after Nwa came out with the cocktail
and saw the FBI had made an attempt to

2291
02:07:50,591 --> 02:07:52,570
charge Nwa.
Wasn't that ice tea?

2292
02:07:52,571 --> 02:07:56,410
Actually it wasn't that they
have one to fuck the police,

2293
02:07:57,550 --> 02:08:01,970
but the FBI went after them under the
concept that they're perpetuating the

2294
02:08:01,971 --> 02:08:05,830
image they're putting out that's making
people do this and the same thing goes.

2295
02:08:05,880 --> 02:08:08,170
That's what it should go.
It should go,

2296
02:08:08,270 --> 02:08:11,480
it should go. But they're making
money off the drug trade in a,

2297
02:08:11,490 --> 02:08:15,500
in a sort of a peripheral entertainment
based way. Right. That's what it is. Yeah.

2298
02:08:15,670 --> 02:08:19,340
So they really are making money off
the glamorization of the drug trade.

2299
02:08:19,410 --> 02:08:22,080
But you, you, you, you forget
the other part of it, which is,

2300
02:08:22,740 --> 02:08:23,920
I mean sometimes you see,

2301
02:08:23,990 --> 02:08:26,880
I don't know if you've ever seen where
they'll rip down a building just to

2302
02:08:26,881 --> 02:08:29,520
create the jobs that built the
building back up with them.

2303
02:08:29,521 --> 02:08:33,030
Making money off of now is actually
ripping down black men's lives.

2304
02:08:33,031 --> 02:08:33,900
And some of these cases,

2305
02:08:34,040 --> 02:08:37,590
cause like what's happening is these black
men come out in these areas and I'm a

2306
02:08:37,591 --> 02:08:41,520
former prosecutor here in la and he's
black men are born into certain areas

2307
02:08:41,700 --> 02:08:45,000
where their crime or their drug,
they're drug infested.

2308
02:08:45,540 --> 02:08:47,970
And then essentially they go
out and they sell the drugs.

2309
02:08:48,240 --> 02:08:51,300
And instead of fixing the drug problem
by saying we not gonna let the drugs in

2310
02:08:51,301 --> 02:08:54,960
the community know more, what they
do is then pushed him into prison.

2311
02:08:54,990 --> 02:08:57,000
But you got to remember it's not
just pushing them into prison.

2312
02:08:57,300 --> 02:09:01,530
There's jobs all along the way, which is
like somebody got a typing, uh, his name.

2313
02:09:01,620 --> 02:09:04,260
Somebody got to file his,
his paperwork.

2314
02:09:04,410 --> 02:09:08,430
These are jobs for everybody else other
than the black people. They get to, uh,

2315
02:09:08,460 --> 02:09:11,880
basically manage this, this
destruction of these, this man's life.

2316
02:09:12,660 --> 02:09:12,871
Yeah.

2317
02:09:12,871 --> 02:09:17,850
There is unquestionably a whole industry
involved and keeping people locked up.

2318
02:09:18,060 --> 02:09:20,290
There's an industry involved
and going after people,

2319
02:09:20,291 --> 02:09:23,520
there's an industry involved and even
making sure that people continue to commit

2320
02:09:23,521 --> 02:09:27,990
crimes, making sure that things, and
he shouldn't even be crime stay crimes.

2321
02:09:27,991 --> 02:09:31,920
So keep people in jail.
And that's hard for people to accept,

2322
02:09:31,921 --> 02:09:34,730
especially those no nonsense.
Mitt Romney love and dudes,

2323
02:09:35,450 --> 02:09:39,090
that's not the way things work.
You're crazy conspiracy theorist,

2324
02:09:39,480 --> 02:09:40,770
but know that that really is,

2325
02:09:40,800 --> 02:09:43,140
they're going to pay $40,000
to keep you in prison,

2326
02:09:43,141 --> 02:09:47,070
but we are not going to get you a job
where you can make 18,000 a year and then

2327
02:09:47,071 --> 02:09:47,970
you won't commit a crime.

2328
02:09:48,440 --> 02:09:50,390
It's crazy how many people are in jail.

2329
02:09:50,420 --> 02:09:53,990
And I don't think most people understand
that the numbers in America are higher

2330
02:09:53,991 --> 02:09:55,550
than anywhere else in the world.

2331
02:09:55,720 --> 02:09:58,110
I go, this is the crazy part is, uh,

2332
02:09:59,040 --> 02:10:02,010
the numbers in America right now
and about 700 per hundred thousand,

2333
02:10:02,110 --> 02:10:05,460
like the highest, the highest that
you've seen basically in the world,

2334
02:10:05,670 --> 02:10:09,420
but the highest rate ever in recorded
nation is about 800, 400,000.

2335
02:10:09,421 --> 02:10:13,550
That was in Russia during the, during
the war camps. Uh, the high, the,

2336
02:10:13,570 --> 02:10:17,550
during the African apartheid for
the Africans that were oppressed,

2337
02:10:17,551 --> 02:10:21,930
it was like eight 52 per 100,000 for
black men today, between 25 and 35,

2338
02:10:22,140 --> 02:10:24,390
it's 10,000 per hundred
thousand that are in prison.

2339
02:10:24,640 --> 02:10:26,820
Holy kinds. The highest rate. Yeah. Great.

2340
02:10:26,820 --> 02:10:28,950
Ever. And, and the thing is,

2341
02:10:28,951 --> 02:10:32,790
it's not even part of the DNC
convention at all. No, no, no.

2342
02:10:33,260 --> 02:10:36,500
Of It as a platform. So you have all
these, when you watched the convention,

2343
02:10:36,501 --> 02:10:38,930
and funny enough, this
is no degrade, but it's,

2344
02:10:39,020 --> 02:10:41,170
it's a lot of African American women.
Well,

2345
02:10:41,180 --> 02:10:43,370
if your father or your brother
or your uncle was in prison,

2346
02:10:43,371 --> 02:10:45,230
you should demand that that's
part of their platform.

2347
02:10:45,490 --> 02:10:49,670
How is that not part of a platform
like that that they address?

2348
02:10:49,730 --> 02:10:53,360
Why are these men have went to prison
for nonviolent offenses for as long as

2349
02:10:53,361 --> 02:10:54,180
they have?

2350
02:10:54,180 --> 02:10:59,010
Yeah. When the numbers are that high,
it seems like that's a social academic.

2351
02:10:59,370 --> 02:11:04,080
Yeah, it's an epidemic. They have to,
they have to figure out what caused that,

2352
02:11:04,110 --> 02:11:07,440
that situation and treat it
like an outbreak of a disease.

2353
02:11:07,441 --> 02:11:11,460
Like there's something fucking terribly
wrong in this one area is one area.

2354
02:11:11,760 --> 02:11:15,820
What was the number again? 10,000
pro. It's 10,000 per hundred thousand

2355
02:11:15,950 --> 02:11:20,930
for black men between 25 and 35 overall
it's 5,000 per 100,000 so that tells you

2356
02:11:20,931 --> 02:11:23,920
the old ones aren't as, I don't go
into prison as much as the youngs.

2357
02:11:24,420 --> 02:11:27,520
It's a, it's a scary number.
That's a terrifying number.

2358
02:11:27,640 --> 02:11:29,930
Cause 10,000 for 100,000 would.

2359
02:11:29,990 --> 02:11:34,540
That's ten one 10 that's
insane. Yeah. One in 10 in jail.

2360
02:11:34,570 --> 02:11:37,300
That's not even counting. The ones
that are, that broke a cycle. Got,

2361
02:11:37,301 --> 02:11:38,560
doesn't even make sense.

2362
02:11:38,710 --> 02:11:41,560
That seems like it's impossible
because you think about it.

2363
02:11:41,561 --> 02:11:44,830
How many people are actually in the hoods?
Not all black guys are in the hood,

2364
02:11:45,070 --> 02:11:48,520
so a lot of black guys are glowing.
Growing up in suburban neighborhoods,

2365
02:11:48,521 --> 02:11:49,450
you have to factor in.

2366
02:11:49,451 --> 02:11:54,451
The hood must be way higher than one
in 10 it's probably 50% it's probably

2367
02:11:55,061 --> 02:11:55,894
something nutty.
Like

2368
02:11:56,200 --> 02:11:58,180
they'll talk about unemployment
or something like that.

2369
02:11:58,240 --> 02:11:59,680
You know when they talk
about these numbers,

2370
02:11:59,681 --> 02:12:03,870
like 15% or I think like
it's 50% that's not right.

2371
02:12:03,970 --> 02:12:04,481
Well,
you know what?

2372
02:12:04,481 --> 02:12:07,840
The numbers are there only in people
haven't been looking the when the,

2373
02:12:07,841 --> 02:12:11,150
when people stop looking at the
numbers don't show up at my brothers.

2374
02:12:11,470 --> 02:12:15,160
They're not looking for a job. They
didn't even count on unemployment. I mean,

2375
02:12:15,161 --> 02:12:18,040
I don't, I don't understand unemployment
rates. I don't, I don't know.

2376
02:12:18,190 --> 02:12:21,640
I don't understand how a president can
create jobs either. When they talk,

2377
02:12:21,641 --> 02:12:23,590
we created 100,000 jobs.
Like what did you,

2378
02:12:23,980 --> 02:12:28,540
what did you do to create jobs
and yeah, maybe that's it, right?

2379
02:12:29,200 --> 02:12:33,490
Yeah. No Shit, man. It's a strange world.

2380
02:12:33,491 --> 02:12:37,240
We have to figure out a way to make it
profitable for evil companies to make

2381
02:12:37,241 --> 02:12:39,460
people smarter and clean up crime.

2382
02:12:39,760 --> 02:12:43,990
If we could figure out a way to take
Halliburton out of Iraq and have them

2383
02:12:43,991 --> 02:12:45,190
rebuild south central,

2384
02:12:45,191 --> 02:12:50,191
make it a trillion dollar contract
to rebuild fucked up areas.

2385
02:12:50,980 --> 02:12:55,600
Wouldn't that be an amazing
way to use resources? I mean,

2386
02:12:56,660 --> 02:13:00,820
I'm in south central though. There's not,
yeah, the one, if you really believe that,

2387
02:13:00,821 --> 02:13:03,690
that's why we're in that
camp or Iraq. Yeah. You, um,

2388
02:13:04,720 --> 02:13:07,930
but you've got to think that there has
got to be some benefit in the resource of

2389
02:13:07,931 --> 02:13:11,860
human beings and developing,
developing intelligent human beings.

2390
02:13:12,920 --> 02:13:17,680
This is a country that slavery, by
the way, every country had slavery,

2391
02:13:18,040 --> 02:13:20,590
every single country. Not only
that, most of them still do.

2392
02:13:21,140 --> 02:13:24,010
I wonder how many countries still rocks.
I mean, including America. I mean,

2393
02:13:24,011 --> 02:13:25,840
when not when I'm playing games,

2394
02:13:25,841 --> 02:13:29,710
if we pretend that we don't have slavery
here because all people that are here

2395
02:13:29,711 --> 02:13:32,850
without green cards or worker
cash essentially are slaves.

2396
02:13:33,030 --> 02:13:37,110
All those poor folks who can't get,
they can't get a green card. You know,

2397
02:13:37,111 --> 02:13:39,300
you sneak over here from
Mexico, man, good luck.

2398
02:13:39,540 --> 02:13:43,200
You sneak over here from anywhere else.
A good, good luck. You got to exist.

2399
02:13:43,440 --> 02:13:45,720
You know, day to day, hoping
you don't get found out,

2400
02:13:45,900 --> 02:13:48,210
you're never going to make more than a
certain amount of money unless you do

2401
02:13:48,211 --> 02:13:50,220
something illegal. You know? I mean,

2402
02:13:50,221 --> 02:13:52,980
and how many people are slavery and
other countries where they take people's

2403
02:13:52,981 --> 02:13:55,860
passports away and they make
them work on construction sites.

2404
02:13:56,070 --> 02:13:59,220
There's a lot of slavery is still going
on and apparently he's busting people

2405
02:13:59,221 --> 02:14:03,990
here and there for a basement full of
indentured servants. You know, it's, it's,

2406
02:14:03,991 --> 02:14:07,110
it's like slavery officially went away,
but it's still,

2407
02:14:07,111 --> 02:14:10,020
there's parts of the world were slavery.
It's pretty goddamn commonplace.

2408
02:14:10,050 --> 02:14:14,520
That's amazing. And 2012 were
that fucked up, you know,

2409
02:14:15,000 --> 02:14:17,220
you'd imagine it. That was
something we could have got rid of.

2410
02:14:17,400 --> 02:14:21,390
What's amazing when you think or how
recent slavery in the United States was?

2411
02:14:21,540 --> 02:14:24,020
Yes, it is. A couple of
hundred years, ain't shit.

2412
02:14:24,030 --> 02:14:27,030
It's not even a couple hundred years.
There was a PBS special, right?

2413
02:14:27,390 --> 02:14:30,900
There was a PBS special called slavery
by another name. I had Rick watch it.

2414
02:14:31,110 --> 02:14:34,530
The guy that, that, that
did the documentary work
for the Wall Street Journal.

2415
02:14:34,920 --> 02:14:36,870
And what he showed is
that why we ended up,

2416
02:14:37,170 --> 02:14:42,170
we ended slavery with the emancipation
proclamation at 1860s we didn't really

2417
02:14:42,630 --> 02:14:46,050
insulate be till 1945 that's when the FBI,
when you said,

2418
02:14:46,051 --> 02:14:48,510
my brother is being held
as a slave on his farm,

2419
02:14:48,660 --> 02:14:52,770
that's the first time the FBI went
and investigated it. So for anything,

2420
02:14:53,750 --> 02:14:58,310
they just let it go. Just let it go. And
then this is the kicker. They, I didn't,

2421
02:14:58,311 --> 02:14:58,950
I mean,

2422
02:14:58,950 --> 02:15:03,950
he showed that between 1865 and 19
like 60 only one white person was ever

2423
02:15:05,041 --> 02:15:08,040
convicted of a murder
of a black man one time.

2424
02:15:10,460 --> 02:15:14,730
Wow. These are, these are the
Democratic national convention. Again,

2425
02:15:14,731 --> 02:15:18,750
didn't talk about any of that. Whoa.
They didn't see the documentary. Oh yeah.

2426
02:15:19,780 --> 02:15:20,900
See, I, you know,

2427
02:15:21,040 --> 02:15:21,371
there's,

2428
02:15:21,371 --> 02:15:24,700
there's people that will get angry when
someone talks about reparations for

2429
02:15:24,701 --> 02:15:25,534
slavery.

2430
02:15:25,540 --> 02:15:30,100
But if you don't think that the culture
needs to put a certain amount of

2431
02:15:30,101 --> 02:15:35,101
emphasis on something that happened
in the previous century that you know,

2432
02:15:35,140 --> 02:15:38,290
I mean if that's really
1940 the previous century,

2433
02:15:38,291 --> 02:15:43,291
that might control the fate of millions
and millions and millions of Americans

2434
02:15:43,901 --> 02:15:47,980
that are in fucked up situations. It just
seems like to me, I've always said this,

2435
02:15:47,981 --> 02:15:51,160
I'll say it one more time. The the society
stronger when you have less losers.

2436
02:15:51,340 --> 02:15:53,320
It would seem to me that if you
really wanted to make America better,

2437
02:15:53,321 --> 02:15:55,310
you don't go to foreign countries.
He take all the,

2438
02:15:55,390 --> 02:15:58,120
the kids that are growing up fucked up
and you figure out a way to get them.

2439
02:15:58,121 --> 02:16:00,010
Counselors,
you figure out a way to bring in sports.

2440
02:16:00,190 --> 02:16:02,470
You figured out a way to get an education.
You figure out a way to,

2441
02:16:02,650 --> 02:16:06,400
it seems to be way cheaper to do that
than it would be to go to Afghanistan with

2442
02:16:06,401 --> 02:16:07,234
tanks.

2443
02:16:07,310 --> 02:16:10,940
You don't see it. You would send this
cocaine worst. They correct. What's that?

2444
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:13,280
I said you would send his cocaine.
Where's the crack too?

2445
02:16:13,281 --> 02:16:16,460
That seems like a logical as
well that that whole thing.

2446
02:16:16,600 --> 02:16:20,200
It's silly isn't it? Crack is worse than
cocaine. If for as far as sentencing,

2447
02:16:20,201 --> 02:16:20,870
right,

2448
02:16:20,870 --> 02:16:21,740
it's a hundred times worse.

2449
02:16:21,741 --> 02:16:25,170
They moved to to 18 it didn't do
it retroactive hundred times worse.

2450
02:16:25,200 --> 02:16:26,470
It was since a hundred times worse.

2451
02:16:26,520 --> 02:16:30,640
So solid to put it in context so people
can understand you for five little rocks.

2452
02:16:30,641 --> 02:16:35,470
You got sentences the same amount
as if you had half a kilo. Whoa.

2453
02:16:35,780 --> 02:16:39,490
That's [inaudible] and it's not just
about the size of it is the realization

2454
02:16:39,491 --> 02:16:44,140
that only a few people will get
to the half a kilo level of sales.

2455
02:16:44,740 --> 02:16:48,100
Everybody does this five rock sales level,

2456
02:16:48,200 --> 02:16:51,710
so it was just a poor crackheads
off the street at will.

2457
02:16:51,800 --> 02:16:56,180
They could just lock everybody in jail
as long as they want it to. And when was,

2458
02:16:56,210 --> 02:16:59,150
when we're private prisons
introduced into this society,

2459
02:17:00,420 --> 02:17:03,450
probably around 80 89 something like that.

2460
02:17:05,030 --> 02:17:07,850
You should find out how and we
should know. That seems like a,

2461
02:17:07,990 --> 02:17:10,690
that seems like a fucking
huge Reagan era mistake.

2462
02:17:11,140 --> 02:17:13,150
You know when we're
private prisons invented,

2463
02:17:15,250 --> 02:17:17,100
but I know they definitely
corrupted the system.

2464
02:17:17,970 --> 02:17:20,670
When you let big corporations
get into prisoners, you know,

2465
02:17:21,190 --> 02:17:23,950
you know that number, like I
gave you earlier, black male,

2466
02:17:23,980 --> 02:17:26,530
black imprisonment in the 70s was like 10%

2467
02:17:26,860 --> 02:17:29,710
92 first happened in the United Kingdom.

2468
02:17:30,600 --> 02:17:30,790
Okay.

2469
02:17:30,790 --> 02:17:35,530
In 1992 they figured it out.
These motherfuckers

2470
02:17:37,990 --> 02:17:42,670
as a lot of jobs to the economy
though. Yeah. Crazy. Yeah,

2471
02:17:42,671 --> 02:17:46,460
I guess it does, right? Yeah. You got
to have somebody, the process file,

2472
02:17:46,461 --> 02:17:48,940
the paperwork you got
have correctional officers

2473
02:17:49,520 --> 02:17:53,180
feed them. Yeah. Like William,
somebody's got to feed them, you know,

2474
02:17:53,390 --> 02:17:56,740
grow the food even though they grow
the food they sell, but they won't. Uh,

2475
02:17:57,290 --> 02:17:59,030
they won't feed that
food to the prisoners.

2476
02:17:59,490 --> 02:18:02,130
Actually in the United
States, in, in, in England,

2477
02:18:02,190 --> 02:18:04,410
they started in the 90s
by the United States.

2478
02:18:04,411 --> 02:18:09,411
They've been doing it since the 18
hundreds beginning in 1868 convict leases

2479
02:18:10,170 --> 02:18:13,800
were issued to private parties
to supplement their workforce.

2480
02:18:14,290 --> 02:18:17,290
And then that's part of this documentary,
a slavery by another name as well.

2481
02:18:17,291 --> 02:18:22,291
What they showed is that is that chase
JP Morgan after slavery ended in 1865

2482
02:18:24,370 --> 02:18:27,490
what they did effectively is they would
make it a crime for you not to have a

2483
02:18:27,491 --> 02:18:30,580
job. It's called vagrancy laws.
And then once they captured you,

2484
02:18:30,581 --> 02:18:33,580
they would give you like three days,
but once you couldn't pay that,

2485
02:18:33,610 --> 02:18:36,670
your fees made it so like it was just
longer and longer and then they would

2486
02:18:36,671 --> 02:18:39,960
throw you in the mind to work it
off and you have a dye in the mind.

2487
02:18:40,030 --> 02:18:41,860
That's essentially what
they're saying here.

2488
02:18:41,950 --> 02:18:45,550
They're saying that farmers
and businessman needed to
find replacements for the

2489
02:18:45,551 --> 02:18:48,300
labor force once their
slaves had been freed. Yeah.

2490
02:18:48,430 --> 02:18:53,430
So beginning in 1868 convict leases were
issued to private parties to supplement

2491
02:18:54,171 --> 02:18:58,240
their workforce. That's fucking
crazy. They just found a loophole.

2492
02:18:58,330 --> 02:19:02,170
They made people go right back to
slavery by just locking them up in jail.

2493
02:19:02,171 --> 02:19:07,171
So jail really essentially private
prisons are a an off shoot of sleep.

2494
02:19:07,231 --> 02:19:07,330
Yeah.

2495
02:19:07,330 --> 02:19:10,530
Yes. It really is an extension of
something called the pig law. That was a,

2496
02:19:10,550 --> 02:19:13,500
and it's funny because the number is more
important than the name of the law of

2497
02:19:13,501 --> 02:19:16,690
the pig law. The minimum sittings. If you
stole, if you were a black guy, you still,

2498
02:19:16,691 --> 02:19:20,530
the white guys pick you. You were
given five years and a felony status.

2499
02:19:20,890 --> 02:19:25,640
Well the mandatory minimum for crack, it's
five years in a felony status. Wow. So,

2500
02:19:26,430 --> 02:19:28,130
so,
so they're not,

2501
02:19:28,340 --> 02:19:29,850
you know,
to genius would they want,

2502
02:19:30,110 --> 02:19:35,110
so what happens was in what they did
was they did this in an 1860s after the,

2503
02:19:35,241 --> 02:19:38,780
um, after slavery was
instituted, it was made illegal.

2504
02:19:38,810 --> 02:19:41,300
But then in the 1980s,

2505
02:19:41,540 --> 02:19:44,180
that's when shit kicked
in to the next level.

2506
02:19:44,181 --> 02:19:46,730
And that was the crack epidemic.

2507
02:19:46,910 --> 02:19:51,520
The crack epidemic actually
opened up the door to, uh,

2508
02:19:51,570 --> 02:19:56,090
ushering a new era of private,
uh, private prisons. Absolutely.

2509
02:19:56,270 --> 02:19:59,090
It's amazing, man. They just,
they realize they can make money.

2510
02:19:59,190 --> 02:20:02,220
Yeah, absolutely. And then, and
then if you look at this music,

2511
02:20:02,250 --> 02:20:06,000
this music doesn't help because it
perpetuates and it almost like a,

2512
02:20:06,150 --> 02:20:10,020
it's like Viagara was six.
You say you listen to this music,

2513
02:20:10,021 --> 02:20:12,690
you become a little
violent, angry, low person.

2514
02:20:12,691 --> 02:20:16,020
And then you do something
that you normally might not
do if you listen to Marvin

2515
02:20:16,020 --> 02:20:16,853
Gaye.
It's true.

2516
02:20:17,180 --> 02:20:19,700
That's a good point. You won't
hurt. Nobody lives in Marvin Gaye,

2517
02:20:20,620 --> 02:20:24,470
modern private prison business first
emerge and established itself publicly in

2518
02:20:24,471 --> 02:20:29,471
1984 when the corrections corporation
of America was awarded a contract,

2519
02:20:30,680 --> 02:20:33,860
it take over a facility in
Hamilton County, Tennessee.

2520
02:20:34,460 --> 02:20:38,940
How much would it suck to go to jail
and Hamilton County, Tennessee? Hmm.

2521
02:20:39,230 --> 02:20:41,270
When these motherfuckers passed that law.

2522
02:20:41,670 --> 02:20:41,821
Yeah.

2523
02:20:41,821 --> 02:20:45,210
They will put you in this line and then
you wouldn't even see the light of day.

2524
02:20:45,240 --> 02:20:48,930
And they would, and the thing about
being a prisoner versus a, a slave,

2525
02:20:48,960 --> 02:20:52,170
they said is that at least as a slave,
you are property.

2526
02:20:52,171 --> 02:20:54,390
So they have some value
for you as property,

2527
02:20:54,690 --> 02:20:57,310
but when you're a prisoner they just
throw you away. So then they didn't,

2528
02:20:57,330 --> 02:20:58,320
they treat you worse.

2529
02:20:59,220 --> 02:21:02,010
Unbelievable. They would just call it
the jail. Didn't tell him how he died.

2530
02:21:02,160 --> 02:21:04,050
Yeah.
Prison is worse than slavery.

2531
02:21:04,080 --> 02:21:07,680
We need to know that there's a benefit
for you being able to work to be healthy.

2532
02:21:07,681 --> 02:21:10,410
So there's a benefit of them
feeding you and keeping you alive.

2533
02:21:10,950 --> 02:21:15,950
Private companies in United States
operate 264 correctional facilities.

2534
02:21:16,530 --> 02:21:19,860
Holy Shit.
Private prisons,

2535
02:21:20,040 --> 02:21:22,620
there's 264 of them in this country.

2536
02:21:22,621 --> 02:21:27,060
They House almost 99,000 adult convicts.

2537
02:21:27,900 --> 02:21:31,710
This isn't sane, man. That's
crazy. That's a scary, scary,

2538
02:21:31,711 --> 02:21:32,910
scary statistic.

2539
02:21:33,840 --> 02:21:37,350
It just makes you really wonder who's
paying attention to any of this while

2540
02:21:37,351 --> 02:21:41,190
everybody's going over gay marriage.
What about gay marriage?

2541
02:21:41,191 --> 02:21:46,191
Like you need to pay attention to the
craziness at the base of our society.

2542
02:21:46,390 --> 02:21:49,270
Well, look what they did with the
crack law. No, they said, okay,

2543
02:21:49,271 --> 02:21:50,290
the crack law was wrong.

2544
02:21:50,950 --> 02:21:55,510
We're going to make an 18 and one but
there's guys had been in prison 25 30

2545
02:21:55,511 --> 02:21:58,630
years. Right now I'm selling
crack and there's no retroactive.

2546
02:21:58,690 --> 02:22:01,390
They didn't make it.
If they have made an 18 to one for them,

2547
02:22:01,420 --> 02:22:02,350
they get out tomorrow.

2548
02:22:02,500 --> 02:22:06,020
Ah Man. And the life was
just wasted. They do it.

2549
02:22:06,040 --> 02:22:09,200
They don't want to take a chance and
they can make money off you being inside.

2550
02:22:09,630 --> 02:22:12,090
And then the crazy part about the cracks,
sins in law is,

2551
02:22:12,150 --> 02:22:15,330
and I asked the another da this
that had more experienced it myself.

2552
02:22:15,900 --> 02:22:19,860
Is there any law on the books nonviolent
this punished that way? And he said, no.

2553
02:22:20,520 --> 02:22:24,270
I mean, yeah and it's a racist law. We
met the guy, we met the guy who wrote it.

2554
02:22:24,370 --> 02:22:27,930
He said that there's no law before or
when he's in our documentary cracking the

2555
02:22:27,931 --> 02:22:31,070
system. You guys got to check
it out when it comes out, uh,

2556
02:22:31,420 --> 02:22:34,450
let us know when is it going to be out
next year? Well, when it comes out,

2557
02:22:34,451 --> 02:22:35,480
come here,
come here again,

2558
02:22:36,180 --> 02:22:37,390
mother fucker through the roof.

2559
02:22:37,480 --> 02:22:40,420
You have him and Rick sitting on
the couch and he looks at ric dead.

2560
02:22:40,421 --> 02:22:43,180
I didn't sit and apologizes
to black America. He says,

2561
02:22:43,181 --> 02:22:45,730
I put more black men in
prison than anybody alive.

2562
02:22:46,090 --> 02:22:49,960
He said that I've never seen a law before
or after it that was written that way

2563
02:22:49,961 --> 02:22:52,270
without he, they didn't do
no investigation. The Da,

2564
02:22:52,300 --> 02:22:55,390
they didn't talk to the agents.
They didn't talk to lab specialists.

2565
02:22:55,391 --> 02:22:56,224
They just wrote the,

2566
02:22:56,280 --> 02:22:59,820
so they just wanted to figure out a way
where they can get people in jail that

2567
02:22:59,821 --> 02:23:00,990
aren't even going to complain.

2568
02:23:01,020 --> 02:23:04,950
And they did it during the era when there
must've been some pressure to clean up

2569
02:23:04,951 --> 02:23:08,760
the streets because I was,
the crack epidemic was crazy.
I remember the epidemic

2570
02:23:09,040 --> 02:23:13,150
people who, who now our guest, it
was crying out to to, you know, uh,

2571
02:23:13,540 --> 02:23:18,490
to change it. Yeah, man, it's fucking
nuts. But yeah, definitely. Uh,

2572
02:23:18,500 --> 02:23:22,150
uh, as soon as we, we get,
we still raising some money,

2573
02:23:22,151 --> 02:23:24,970
we got to raise a few more hundred
grand for this crack in the systems.

2574
02:23:25,300 --> 02:23:29,740
But what we did is we've been going
around investigating, doing all our work,

2575
02:23:29,800 --> 02:23:33,250
you know, going over archive footage
around the Reagan, talking about,

2576
02:23:33,280 --> 02:23:35,230
we've got Ronald Reagan talking
about crack cocaine, right.

2577
02:23:35,290 --> 02:23:35,710
We got,

2578
02:23:35,710 --> 02:23:40,660
we got a cop that was in that did five
years for basically it's planting drugs.

2579
02:23:40,661 --> 02:23:42,400
And for the first time
ever he's on camera.

2580
02:23:43,030 --> 02:23:47,920
He looks like fucking Deniro or somebody
classic. And so we got, we got him,

2581
02:23:47,950 --> 02:23:48,700
uh,

2582
02:23:48,700 --> 02:23:53,620
basically talking about what drove him
to plant drugs and to actually take

2583
02:23:53,621 --> 02:23:55,030
money, cause you know, you come in,

2584
02:23:55,240 --> 02:23:58,870
we're talking about 1980 you come into
a house with a 15 year old kid in there

2585
02:23:58,990 --> 02:24:03,970
and there's $60,000 on the, on the floor,
which is like $300,000 today. You're,

2586
02:24:04,150 --> 02:24:04,630
you know,

2587
02:24:04,630 --> 02:24:08,200
there's a lot of things that go through
your mind and when he goes through the

2588
02:24:08,201 --> 02:24:13,180
process of how you get to the point
where you take 150 and you reported 150,

2589
02:24:13,181 --> 02:24:17,140
right. And how his family needed things
and it's just crazy. This doc is go,

2590
02:24:17,470 --> 02:24:18,910
we going,
we going to ask it with this one.

2591
02:24:19,400 --> 02:24:23,510
Wow. I can't wait to see it. Definitely
come in right before it happens, man.

2592
02:24:23,540 --> 02:24:26,330
Come in right before you release it.
We'll, we'll blow that fucking thing up.

2593
02:24:26,770 --> 02:24:31,160
And um, one of the questions, what's the
most realistic movie on the drug trade?

2594
02:24:31,161 --> 02:24:35,300
Is there any realistic
movies that I saw like blow,

2595
02:24:35,301 --> 02:24:38,780
was that really close? Close. Close.
Yeah. That's why I let nick, right my, uh,

2596
02:24:39,590 --> 02:24:42,740
my script because I was the same guy.
It's writing your scripts. Yeah. Yeah.

2597
02:24:42,741 --> 02:24:46,440
Blow was really closed. What's
his name? Nick. What? Yeah,

2598
02:24:46,750 --> 02:24:50,270
he's supposed to direct a movie for us.
When is that going to happen?

2599
02:24:50,750 --> 02:24:53,960
We working on that right now too
is too short gun play. You know

2600
02:24:55,730 --> 02:24:59,870
Tim Shorrock
you're facially,

2601
02:24:59,871 --> 02:25:04,070
you guys look similar. A little bit too
short. They had a conversation last night.

2602
02:25:04,160 --> 02:25:08,460
No, I'm just a too short fan.
Is that right? Yeah. Great
Rapper. I let him know. Yeah,

2603
02:25:08,600 --> 02:25:13,220
please do man. I love that guy. He's in
town. I'm bringing him through. Please do.

2604
02:25:13,250 --> 02:25:16,430
Please do what? Uh, what
actor is going to play you?

2605
02:25:16,980 --> 02:25:20,640
We don't know yet. Uh, we tinkering
with what kind of quite a few people.

2606
02:25:20,641 --> 02:25:24,010
I talked to Jamie Foxx about a week ago.
Jamie Foxx can do anything.

2607
02:25:24,310 --> 02:25:27,370
Yeah. That guy can become anybody.
When then when I saw the Ray Charles,

2608
02:25:27,371 --> 02:25:29,310
I was like, nobody else could
have done that. And then,

2609
02:25:29,311 --> 02:25:31,750
then when they said he was going to play
Mike Tyson, I was like, he could do it.

2610
02:25:32,150 --> 02:25:35,170
They could do it. He could do it with a
picture with him, him and Jamie on it.

2611
02:25:36,370 --> 02:25:39,750
He could, uh, he could play Mike
Tyson and everybody's like, what?

2612
02:25:39,850 --> 02:25:40,800
He doesn't look anything like my,

2613
02:25:40,801 --> 02:25:44,320
so he could get to look like Mike Tyson
and he could pull it. He could do it.

2614
02:25:44,321 --> 02:25:45,154
I know he could do it.

2615
02:25:45,400 --> 02:25:48,130
Jamie had to be at and everything cause
he was doing just Django unchained.

2616
02:25:48,310 --> 02:25:52,150
Oh that's right. When is
that coming out? In December.

2617
02:25:52,240 --> 02:25:55,060
I saw the ads for it a while ago.
I supposed to come out the same heat.

2618
02:25:55,061 --> 02:25:55,661
When they do that,

2619
02:25:55,661 --> 02:25:59,590
they get your dick hard like six months
in advance for a good movie and then you

2620
02:25:59,591 --> 02:26:00,040
wait,

2621
02:26:00,040 --> 02:26:01,840
we gonna we gonna we gonna
knock 'em out with this.

2622
02:26:01,841 --> 02:26:06,080
When he talked to the real Scarface.
Wow.

2623
02:26:06,081 --> 02:26:09,610
I mean this is your real life story and
that's what really trips me out about,

2624
02:26:09,640 --> 02:26:13,030
about Hollywood is, you know,
when you come with a real story,

2625
02:26:13,570 --> 02:26:18,570
they don't really get that same type of
drive where they then yesterday somebody

2626
02:26:18,611 --> 02:26:19,750
come to me,
right?

2627
02:26:19,751 --> 02:26:24,700
They want to hire me as a consultant
to go on a TV show about a gangster in

2628
02:26:24,701 --> 02:26:26,440
south central Los Angeles. I'm like, well,

2629
02:26:26,830 --> 02:26:30,040
why are you guys doing a fictional story
when you got the real thing right here?

2630
02:26:30,990 --> 02:26:35,890
Oh, well it's probably too scary
for them right there. Yeah.

2631
02:26:38,190 --> 02:26:39,023
Yeah,
he could.

2632
02:26:39,570 --> 02:26:39,951
Yeah.

2633
02:26:39,951 --> 02:26:44,390
And what's crazy is we were talking to
a guy that did Benjamin buttons or how

2634
02:26:44,391 --> 02:26:47,390
you would make them look 20 again.
It's given us all the special effects.

2635
02:26:47,470 --> 02:26:51,040
Oh yeah, you could do amazing shit. And
see that movie tron where they took a,

2636
02:26:51,041 --> 02:26:54,880
what's up? What's on boys
now? The fucking older dude,

2637
02:26:55,190 --> 02:26:58,870
I want to say William hurt, but that's
on him now. Jeff Bridges. Jeff Bridges.

2638
02:26:59,080 --> 02:27:02,560
They turned Jeff Bridges back to where
he was when he was like 20 years old.

2639
02:27:02,620 --> 02:27:06,370
Benjamin buttons. They did that with the
Brad Pitt. Yeah, they could do anything.

2640
02:27:06,400 --> 02:27:09,460
It's as far as that. But as far
as like pulling it off, Jamie,

2641
02:27:09,520 --> 02:27:10,480
you got to get Jamie Foxx.

2642
02:27:10,630 --> 02:27:13,540
He played that homeless dude
who was the the music virtual,

2643
02:27:13,541 --> 02:27:17,350
so like he could do anything, man.
He's just one of those dudes. He just,

2644
02:27:17,420 --> 02:27:20,350
he didn't matter what he seems like when
he's just talking and interviews and

2645
02:27:20,351 --> 02:27:22,930
fucking around.
When it comes down to actual acting,

2646
02:27:22,931 --> 02:27:25,540
he's one of those dudes that
can become a different guy.

2647
02:27:25,900 --> 02:27:28,570
There's only a few of those.
Russell Crowe,

2648
02:27:28,690 --> 02:27:31,510
you know Daniel Day Lewis
type dudes out there.

2649
02:27:31,870 --> 02:27:34,150
But Jamie Foxx can do
the shit out of that.

2650
02:27:35,350 --> 02:27:38,680
That Ray Charles Man God
damn it was phenomenal.

2651
02:27:38,860 --> 02:27:41,290
And then when you realize he's
actually singing that shit.

2652
02:27:41,291 --> 02:27:45,520
That's what's even crazier. Like Jamie
Foxx is fucking incredible singer too.

2653
02:27:45,620 --> 02:27:47,690
Yeah. And the thing about our
script, the way it's written,

2654
02:27:47,900 --> 02:27:51,050
it's like a mix between traffic.
I would say traffic,

2655
02:27:51,470 --> 02:27:55,720
a blow and like Boyz in the hood. No
north face. No Scarface. Scarface too.

2656
02:27:55,780 --> 02:27:57,100
Well that's what I'm going
to tell you the interesting,

2657
02:27:57,140 --> 02:27:59,600
let me say one more thing about Scarface
cause we met with the producer of

2658
02:27:59,601 --> 02:28:03,320
Scarface and it's interesting cause
we were sitting in watching Scarface.

2659
02:28:03,870 --> 02:28:06,290
Remember that 83 is like
around the same time it's Rick.

2660
02:28:06,560 --> 02:28:10,310
And like when Scarface goes over
overseas to the, to the connection,

2661
02:28:10,490 --> 02:28:12,950
he's talking about like
a hundred keys a month.

2662
02:28:13,800 --> 02:28:18,480
Rick has done that a day. It's so
like, it's like, get your weight up,

2663
02:28:18,481 --> 02:28:22,850
Scarface,
just clown this story.

2664
02:28:22,851 --> 02:28:26,960
This story actually has a international
appeal. Just like I said, like Costa Rica,

2665
02:28:26,961 --> 02:28:29,200
tiny, he's picked up this
spin article. Oh, it's fast.

2666
02:28:29,340 --> 02:28:34,230
So we have the way it's written, it's
not just Rick, it's like 60%, 50% black,

2667
02:28:34,530 --> 02:28:38,250
30% Latino. And then, uh, the
other, the remainder is white.

2668
02:28:38,251 --> 02:28:41,880
So you have the reporter and you
have, uh, the, the politicians,

2669
02:28:42,090 --> 02:28:45,300
you have the Latino or the Nicaraguans
and then you have Rick story.

2670
02:28:45,450 --> 02:28:49,200
So this is just how the phenomenal,
uh, reach for everybody who, uh,

2671
02:28:49,230 --> 02:28:51,480
who likes different aspects
of those kinds of movies.

2672
02:28:51,920 --> 02:28:56,090
Yeah, that sounds pretty
fucking incredible, man. And
you know, so you, you haven't,

2673
02:28:56,210 --> 02:28:59,990
they don't have the, the, the, the
script's done, but they don't have a cast.

2674
02:28:59,991 --> 02:29:02,360
They don't have a d projection
when it's going to start via.

2675
02:29:02,361 --> 02:29:03,920
We still raising the budget right now.

2676
02:29:04,580 --> 02:29:06,290
You could sell crack cocaine
to make a lot of money.

2677
02:29:06,320 --> 02:29:11,320
[inaudible] you learn from the story.

2678
02:29:12,051 --> 02:29:16,550
The story is so important.
Now do you have a Kickstarter account?

2679
02:29:16,580 --> 02:29:20,480
Because that's, it seems like one of
the best ways to raise a bunch of money,

2680
02:29:20,481 --> 02:29:23,750
especially for a movie or something
like that through Kickstarter.

2681
02:29:23,840 --> 02:29:25,580
And if you ever have something like that,

2682
02:29:25,581 --> 02:29:28,700
please come back and we'll promote the
shit out of anything you guys want.

2683

just let me know and you can come back.

2684
02:29:31,140 --> 02:29:33,890
We enjoyed the shit out of
this as well as the last time.

2685
02:29:34,180 --> 02:29:37,280

2692
02:29:54,800 --> 02:29:55,970

tuned in and I want to thank one of them.

2696
02:30:05,411 --> 02:30:07,210
Most Guy William Blankenship,

2697
02:30:07,250 --> 02:30:10,870
he apparently got upset because we use
some of his artwork and a caricature and

2698
02:30:10,871 --> 02:30:14,420
a and the recent ad for a Santa Barbara.

2699
02:30:14,450 --> 02:30:19,370
But you'd probably just pulled some shit
off lines. Yeah. Google search her name.

2700
02:30:20,620 --> 02:30:24,770
It's not labeled on our stand. How silly
it is, but it's like an Avatar. He,

2701
02:30:24,771 --> 02:30:28,640
we didn't know he wanted
to just get credit, so I'm
giving them credit. William,

2702
02:30:28,670 --> 02:30:32,690
thanks a lot dude. Thanks for making
that. No, he's not. He's not complaining.

2703
02:30:32,691 --> 02:30:35,750
He's just being a little needy.
