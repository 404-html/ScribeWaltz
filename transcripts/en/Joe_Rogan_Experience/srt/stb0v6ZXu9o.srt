1
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:04,283
Hey everybody,

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:07,410
we're doing a podcast again.

3
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:08,370
Can you believe it?

4
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:12,510
Can you believe we even still alive
after that Shane Smith podcast,

5
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:16,110
the podcast for everyone who thought
it was the best podcast ever.

6
00:00:16,111 --> 00:00:18,360
Thank you for everyone
who tweeted me and said,

7
00:00:18,361 --> 00:00:18,990
it sucked.

8
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:19,620
I'm sorry.

9
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:20,940
Who are these people
that think that sucked?

10
00:00:20,941 --> 00:00:22,280
That was fucking fun.

11
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:24,630
Everybody has the right
to their own opinion,

12
00:00:24,631 --> 00:00:25,464
sir.

13
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:26,010
Okay.

14
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:28,170
And I'm my apologies to,

15
00:00:28,171 --> 00:00:29,004
to anybody who did,

16
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:30,420
we didn't mean to get that fucked up.

17
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:33,330
That's just what happens when you
drink with Shane Smith of vice.com.

18
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:34,290
I think that was the second time.

19
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,180
The second most drunk I've ever seen you.

20
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:36,661
Yeah,

21
00:00:36,661 --> 00:00:37,051
it was pretty,

22
00:00:37,051 --> 00:00:39,590
pretty hammered this episode of the Joe.

23
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:41,340
Some guy sent me a message like that.

24
00:00:41,341 --> 00:00:43,530
He went to the comedy show and
he was mad at me because I,

25
00:00:43,531 --> 00:00:44,040
uh,

26
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,120
I made a cancer joke.

27
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:45,751
I'm like,

28
00:00:45,751 --> 00:00:47,160
I don't have a cancer joke in my act,

29
00:00:47,161 --> 00:00:47,760
man.

30
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:48,880
I don't if I said,

31
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:50,340
I don't know where it came from.

32
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:51,460
I Dunno.

33
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:53,180
He said the cancer joke was not cool.

34
00:00:53,181 --> 00:00:53,880
It was like,

35
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:54,960
I don't think I have one man.

36
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,880
Maybe it was a drunken joke.

37
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:59,820
I can't see where I would,

38
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:04,970
I'm pretty sure at the end of that show
that I know when I'm trying new stuff

39
00:01:04,971 --> 00:01:07,230
out or when I'm venturing
off into strange territory.

40
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:08,340
I don't think there was any of that.

41
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:11,760
This episode of the Joe Rogan experience,

42
00:01:11,761 --> 00:01:16,410
Bud Kist is brought to
you by Ting Ting is uh,

43
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:18,090
first of all they are,

44
00:01:18,091 --> 00:01:22,500
I'm a supporter of this podcast because
we believe in companies that are not

45
00:01:22,501 --> 00:01:25,560
trying to rip people off that are given
you a good service at a reasonable price

46
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:28,890
and have reasonable rules.

47
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,560
I don't like contracts
with cell phone companies.

48
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,790
I think it's gross.

49
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,140
I understand it.

50
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:35,460
When you buy a phone,

51
00:01:35,461 --> 00:01:37,980
say if you buy a phone from
Verizon and you'd get it for,

52
00:01:37,981 --> 00:01:38,220
you know,

53
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:39,540
x amount of dollars.

54
00:01:39,541 --> 00:01:41,160
If you sign up for three year service,

55
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,450
when he tried to cancel,

56
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,860
they hit you with a big fee.

57
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:47,220
The reason why they hit you with that
big fee is because you didn't really pay

58
00:01:47,221 --> 00:01:49,860
for the whole price of that cell phone.

59
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:55,040
They sort of factor it in over the course
of three years and then when you want

60
00:01:55,801 --> 00:01:56,341
to cancel,

61
00:01:56,341 --> 00:01:57,390
they want that money back.

62
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:57,960
Okay.

63
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,040
I think that's silly.

64
00:01:59,041 --> 00:02:00,290
It's just like it's,

65
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:01,560
it's not necessary.

66
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:02,340
Okay.

67
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:04,690
And it's also not necessary to,

68
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:08,210
to have it set up where you like,

69
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:10,590
you can't have two
people in the same plan.

70
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:11,730
Um,

71
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:12,630
ting has that.

72
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:15,090
They have it set up so that you can,

73
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:15,601
first of all,

74
00:02:15,601 --> 00:02:17,550
no contracts you can buy.

75
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:19,620
They have high level android phones,

76
00:02:19,621 --> 00:02:21,810
the best android phones available,

77
00:02:21,811 --> 00:02:25,110
including the Samsung Galaxy s three
soon to be as far I think it's coming out

78
00:02:25,111 --> 00:02:25,560
really soon.

79
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,670
And the uh,

80
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:30,020
Samsung Galaxy note to
really cool cell phones.

81
00:02:30,021 --> 00:02:30,480
So you,

82
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,950
you don't have to deal with crappy phones.

83
00:02:31,951 --> 00:02:33,750
You're also dealing
with the sprint network.

84
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,940
So it's not like they
have their own network.

85
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:37,650
They have a major network.

86
00:02:37,651 --> 00:02:38,580
It's excellent service.

87
00:02:38,581 --> 00:02:42,150
I've got nothing but people saying
good things about it on Twitter.

88
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:44,940
Ever since we started
having them as a sponsor,

89
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:48,240
including people saying how
much they've been saving.

90
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:48,571
Now,

91
00:02:48,571 --> 00:02:53,220
one of the things that I really love
about Ting is credits on unused service.

92
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:55,260
I just think this is such a great idea.

93
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:56,340
There's plans,

94
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,920
but if you use less than
you thought you would,

95
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:01,300
tink drops you down to the
level that you hit and you,

96
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,490
they credit you the
difference on your next bill.

97
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,470
You can't ask for anything more than that.

98
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:07,090
It's good service.

99
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,700
It's a good company and
it's all reasonable.

100
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:13,120
And if you go to rogan.ting.com
and you can save yourself 25 bucks,

101
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:17,200
either off service or off one
of their groovy cell phones.

102
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:20,520
And by the way that they have
used ones also as you know,

103
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:24,330
and they're just refurbished ones and I
haven't bought refurbished ones through

104
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:24,641
tank,

105
00:03:24,641 --> 00:03:27,730
but I bought refurbished phones before
and then there are a lot cheaper.

106
00:03:27,731 --> 00:03:29,560
So if you're looking for
a phone on the cheap,

107
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:30,640
you could even get,

108
00:03:30,641 --> 00:03:30,881
you know,

109
00:03:30,881 --> 00:03:34,210
get like the Samsung Galaxy
s two epic four g touch,

110
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:34,511
you know,

111
00:03:34,511 --> 00:03:36,130
and that's like a lot cheaper than,

112
00:03:36,131 --> 00:03:36,370
you know,

113
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:37,091
buying it new.

114
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:39,400
So if you even need a cheaper phone,

115
00:03:39,401 --> 00:03:39,850
you can.

116
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:42,130
You have to use marketplace also at tig.

117
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:42,651
Yeah,

118
00:03:42,651 --> 00:03:43,670
and the reality is,

119
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:46,160
unless you're like some crazy power user,

120
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:46,730
you know,

121
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:47,600
if you're on a budget,

122
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:50,480
you can get by with a phone that was
really cool a couple of years ago and you

123
00:03:50,481 --> 00:03:52,860
want to get him to notice it
barely makes a difference.

124
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:54,290
It does pretty much the same shit.

125
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:57,440
I love that Samsung Galaxy s
three and I love the screen.

126
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:58,071
It's amazing.

127
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:00,620
Once you go to that screen for
looking at web pages or the note,

128
00:04:00,621 --> 00:04:01,370
which was even more,

129
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:02,450
more insane,

130
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:03,810
you'll love it.

131
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:04,101
All right,

132
00:04:04,101 --> 00:04:04,670
so go there.

133
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:07,070

Start building your website.

143
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:33,230
They also have online commerce.

144
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:34,640
It's super easy to set up.

145

Really cool stuff if you've
never tried it before.

148
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:46,580
I know nothing about coding.

149
00:04:46,581 --> 00:04:50,450
Brian's actually coded websites on
notepad with html and all that jazz.

150
00:04:50,451 --> 00:04:54,170
But for a person like me that I am
not going to learn how to do this,

151
00:04:54,171 --> 00:04:55,010
it's not happening.

152
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,750
But I've gone to Squarespace.

153
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:57,980
I've checked out there.

154
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,780
It's very intuitive the way
they have it set up and I,

155
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:03,080
I'm very confident that I
could set up my own website.

156
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:05,570
So they have it there where,

157
00:05:05,571 --> 00:05:06,110
um,

158
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:06,471
you,

159
00:05:06,471 --> 00:05:07,310
you also,

160
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:07,910
um,

161
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:09,920

162
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:11,630

165
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,520
You don't have to pay anything,

166
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:21,110
but if you decide to purchase it,

167
00:05:21,111 --> 00:05:23,180
use the offer code Joe Three,

168
00:05:23,181 --> 00:05:24,800
that's Joe and a number three,

169
00:05:24,801 --> 00:05:25,970
three because of March,

170
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:28,940
and you'll get 10% off your
first purchase on new accounts,

171
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:31,820
including monthly and annual plans.

172
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:32,151
Okay,

173
00:05:32,151 --> 00:05:37,151
so that's squarespace.com forward slash
Joe and use the offer code Joe Three.

174
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:40,070
If you want to try it out
and save yourself some cash

175
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:40,961
and it's really cheap,

176
00:05:40,961 --> 00:05:44,710
like their highest price plan for like
unlimited bandwidth and storage and

177
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:45,820
everything is $24.

178
00:05:45,821 --> 00:05:47,560
That's their most expensive plan.

179
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:47,801
Yeah,

180
00:05:47,801 --> 00:05:48,634
that's awesome.

181
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:49,900
We live in strange times,

182
00:05:49,901 --> 00:05:50,191
folks.

183
00:05:50,191 --> 00:05:50,380
Yeah,

184
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:51,190
it's cool.

185
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:52,170
It's cool that you can do that.

186
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:54,280
It's cool that you can build
your own websites really.

187
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,020
And I'm not exaggerating at all.

188
00:05:56,021 --> 00:05:56,201
Wait,

189
00:05:56,201 --> 00:05:57,040
wait til you go and try it out.

190
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:57,680
It's excellent.

191
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:57,851
It's,

192
00:05:57,851 --> 00:05:58,850
it's a really cool service.

193
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:02,840
We're also brought to you by on.com
a lot of new stuff in it on it.

194
00:06:02,841 --> 00:06:05,750
If you've never seen any of the
fitness equipment that we have now,

195
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,050
um,

196
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:06,560
we have,

197
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,130
uh,

198
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:08,210
pull up bars,

199
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,200
jump ropes,

200
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:10,220
steel maces,

201
00:06:10,221 --> 00:06:11,120
steel clubs,

202
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,081
kettle bells,

203
00:06:12,081 --> 00:06:12,914
battle ropes,

204
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:15,200
all kinds of stuff for functional fitness.

205
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:19,250
I can only do this commercial so many
times before it becomes ridiculously

206
00:06:19,251 --> 00:06:19,761
redundant.

207
00:06:19,761 --> 00:06:21,210
So if you've heard this
podcast a few times,

208
00:06:21,211 --> 00:06:22,400
you'll probably fucking hate me already.

209
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:23,270
Uh,

210
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:24,103
cool stuff.

211
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,760
As far as a supplements,

212
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:27,230
including health supplements,

213
00:06:27,231 --> 00:06:31,190
like Himalayan salt and
killer bee honey and MCT oil,

214
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:31,780
uh,

215
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:31,931
we,

216
00:06:31,931 --> 00:06:33,500
we even sell Blendtec blenders.

217
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:37,340
We sell basically things
that can aid you in your,

218
00:06:37,341 --> 00:06:37,581
your,

219
00:06:37,581 --> 00:06:38,870
your physical performance,

220
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:39,980
your mental performance.

221
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:44,930
You're just supplements and fitness
equipment to make you better at life.

222
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:45,740
Bitch.

223
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:46,250
All right.

224
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:46,851
You use a code name,

225
00:06:46,851 --> 00:06:47,360
Rogan,

226
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,240
and you will save 10% off
any and all supplements.

227
00:06:50,241 --> 00:06:50,871
And as I said,

228
00:06:50,871 --> 00:06:53,000
we have a plethora of them.

229
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:54,710
I remember in the old days
when we first started out,

230
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:55,910
I'd be able to named you.

231
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:56,271
I just,

232
00:06:56,271 --> 00:06:57,230
a couple of them might say,

233
00:06:57,231 --> 00:06:57,561
Hey,

234
00:06:57,561 --> 00:06:57,681
go,

235
00:06:57,681 --> 00:06:59,360
I'll try some Alpha brain.

236
00:06:59,361 --> 00:07:00,290
Try some shrimp tech.

237
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:01,310
Now it's just ridiculous.

238
00:07:01,311 --> 00:07:02,144
I'm not even gonna try,

239
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,680
but go check it out.

240
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:06,320
Enjoy on it.com code named Brogan.

241

242
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:08,810
All right,

243
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:09,320
folks.

244
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,990
Jacob Ward is here from
Popular Science magazine.

245
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:12,920
We're going to get freaky.

246
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,760
We're going to learn some shit.

247
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:15,740
We're going to educate the masses.

248
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:17,330
They're up his Twitter account,

249
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:20,000
the Joe Rogan experience.

250
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:21,231
Try it by day.

251
00:07:21,231 --> 00:07:23,210
Joe Rogan podcast by night.

252
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,470
Powerful Jacob Ward.

253
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:30,460
But you prefer Jake,

254
00:07:30,461 --> 00:07:30,880
right?

255
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:31,121
I do.

256
00:07:31,121 --> 00:07:31,331
Yeah.

257
00:07:31,331 --> 00:07:32,020
Call me Jake.

258
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:33,280
Jacob is very biblical dude.

259
00:07:33,281 --> 00:07:35,740
I gotta tell you I'm sold
on all of your sponsors.

260
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:36,070
Really?

261
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:37,840
I don't know if you are what?

262
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:40,540
I see a lot of pitches during my day.

263
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:40,930
You know,

264
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:42,310
I spend my professional daylight.

265
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:42,671
Look at,

266
00:07:42,671 --> 00:07:43,620
people are pitching me all the time.

267
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:44,770
Stuff's cool.

268
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:46,210
And you actually made the sound of the,

269
00:07:46,211 --> 00:07:46,790
of the,

270
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:48,130
the name of the galaxy,

271
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:49,240
uh,

272
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:49,990
sound cool,

273
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:51,800
which is impossible as the worst.

274
00:07:51,801 --> 00:07:53,040
This the longest name performance.

275
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:55,090
A great piece of technology
with a terrible name.

276
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:56,900
Yeah.

277
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:58,650
Galaxy x three galaxy note four.

278
00:07:58,651 --> 00:07:59,484
It's just too long.

279
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:00,760
I know they cut a lot of phones,

280
00:08:00,761 --> 00:08:02,380
but I was just thinking
that the other day.

281
00:08:02,381 --> 00:08:03,730
Why don't they just call it like,

282
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,190
there's a lot of names in this world.

283
00:08:06,191 --> 00:08:07,024
I'm here to tell you.

284
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:07,831
Yeah.

285
00:08:07,831 --> 00:08:08,280
The,

286
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,360
there's no need for that.

287
00:08:09,361 --> 00:08:09,690
Right?

288
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:12,410
Why does everything have to be
note this and three and four,

289
00:08:12,411 --> 00:08:13,244
right.

290
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:14,020
I don't know.

291
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:14,711
But the tech,

292
00:08:14,711 --> 00:08:14,951
I mean,

293
00:08:14,951 --> 00:08:16,660
the stuff itself is amazing
and you're absolutely right.

294
00:08:16,661 --> 00:08:18,550
They're like a couple of years old phone.

295
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:19,660
He's a great deal.

296
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,380
Like those,

297
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:21,640
they change so fast.

298
00:08:21,641 --> 00:08:22,060
Yeah.

299
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:23,500
Especially the Samsung phones.

300
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:23,980
Yeah.

301
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:24,311
Apple,

302
00:08:24,311 --> 00:08:26,770
you have to wait a couple of years for
a new iPhone because each one has to

303
00:08:26,771 --> 00:08:27,560
knock it out of the park.

304
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,240
You gotta go all the way with apple.

305
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:30,320
Yeah,

306
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,340
but I'm not,

307
00:08:31,341 --> 00:08:34,400
I don't have the confidence in them
without Steve jobs at the helm.

308
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:35,360
I need a crazy person.

309
00:08:35,361 --> 00:08:36,740
Completely obsessed with success.

310
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:38,510
Totally regular Tim Cook Fella.

311
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:39,770
He's terms like a regular dude.

312
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:40,421
Yeah.

313
00:08:40,421 --> 00:08:40,560
I,

314
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,830
I don't know enough about him.

315
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:43,810
He's supposedly a very orderly person,

316
00:08:43,811 --> 00:08:44,470
which you would need.

317
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:44,711
Like,

318
00:08:44,711 --> 00:08:45,580
at the very least,

319
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:48,040
you got to run the hell out of that place.

320
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:49,030
I think when he gets home,

321
00:08:49,031 --> 00:08:51,040
he probably relaxes and I don't need that.

322
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:52,540
I need that in my seat.

323
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:52,960
Yeah.

324
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,850
You need a guy driving around,

325
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:58,920
pissed off at coders because
they got something wrong.

326
00:08:58,921 --> 00:09:00,690
And Google maps with Tacoma,

327
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:01,050
you know?

328
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:01,450
That's right.

329
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:01,870
That's right.

330
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:02,850
It's fucking Tacoma,

331
00:09:02,851 --> 00:09:04,570
Washington at the wrong
place or whatever it is,

332
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:07,710
whatever it is it Steve
jobs go bananas for.

333
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:08,430
Right.

334
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:10,200
How long have you been the
editor of Popular Science?

335
00:09:10,201 --> 00:09:10,651
So I had a,

336
00:09:10,651 --> 00:09:11,490
I had a crazy experience.

337
00:09:11,491 --> 00:09:15,810
I was the second in command at
puppet science for five years.

338
00:09:15,811 --> 00:09:18,000
I was like the doer and a,

339
00:09:18,001 --> 00:09:22,590
and then my boss decided to leave and I
got promoted about seven months ago and

340
00:09:22,591 --> 00:09:23,580
suddenly like I'm,

341
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:26,220
I'm running 140 year old magazine.

342
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:27,083
I'll tell you right now,

343
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:28,500
it's a big responsibility.

344
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:29,790
And I am,

345
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:30,980
I feel free and you know,

346
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:32,790
I freak out each morning for five minutes.

347
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:33,091
I'm like,

348
00:09:33,091 --> 00:09:35,400
I can't believe I'm about to go
make these decisions and then boom,

349
00:09:35,401 --> 00:09:36,234
I go off and do it.

350
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:38,230
It's a great thing that an honor.

351
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:38,850
Um,

352
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:39,081
the,

353
00:09:39,081 --> 00:09:39,241
the,

354
00:09:39,241 --> 00:09:39,750
the,

355
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:44,460
the popular science episode that I a or
a issue that I quote to people all the

356
00:09:44,461 --> 00:09:49,200
time is the one way
back in the 1930s camps.

357
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:50,530
A new billion dollar crop.

358
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:51,361
Totally.

359
00:09:51,361 --> 00:09:52,860
We were way out in advance of that.

360
00:09:52,861 --> 00:09:53,940
That's what's cool about popular science.

361
00:09:53,941 --> 00:09:54,730
It's like we are,

362
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:57,030
we're at least five or 10 years ahead of,

363
00:09:57,031 --> 00:09:57,181
you know,

364
00:09:57,181 --> 00:09:58,890
we put our flag into each issue.

365
00:09:58,891 --> 00:09:59,790
If you look through history,

366
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:01,170
I can't take credit for that personally,

367
00:10:01,171 --> 00:10:02,940
but it's really cool that it happened.

368
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:03,833
You know,

369
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,760
that was on the cover of popular,

370
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:05,881
oh,

371
00:10:05,881 --> 00:10:07,470
it was actually popular mechanics.

372
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,160
That's cool.

373
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:08,760
That's cool.

374
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,061
I hear,

375
00:10:09,061 --> 00:10:10,020
I'll clear up the confusion.

376
00:10:10,021 --> 00:10:10,411
For a lot of people,

377
00:10:10,411 --> 00:10:10,861
people were like,

378
00:10:10,861 --> 00:10:11,191
why are,

379
00:10:11,191 --> 00:10:12,330
why is there popular mechanics,

380
00:10:12,331 --> 00:10:16,350
popular science on this stuff and why
aren't we the same magazine were actually

381
00:10:16,351 --> 00:10:17,071
competitors,

382
00:10:17,071 --> 00:10:17,881
which is a weird thing,

383
00:10:17,881 --> 00:10:21,420
but it's because we date from the era
when everything had the word popular with

384
00:10:21,421 --> 00:10:22,254
the front of it,

385
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:23,460
popular portraiture,

386
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:24,120
popular,

387
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:24,390
you know,

388
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:25,190
whatever it was the name.

389
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:26,040
It was basically saying like,

390
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:26,880
hey normal person,

391
00:10:26,881 --> 00:10:27,720
come read this thing.

392
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,860
You don't have to be an expert.

393
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:30,930
Unfortunately I was incorrect.

394
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:31,530
Um,

395
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:34,110
popular science actually
demonized Marilyn.

396
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:35,183
That's probably true.

397
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:40,430
We probably did way back in 1936 it was
when the government had gotten their

398
00:10:41,941 --> 00:10:42,900
greedy little pause.

399
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:44,041
Let's be fair.

400
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:44,291
You know,

401
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:46,170
that's the depths of the depression.

402
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:47,700
Everyone's freaking out,

403
00:10:47,701 --> 00:10:48,030
you know,

404
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:48,930
that is not you.

405
00:10:48,931 --> 00:10:50,670
And that is not the
popular science of today.

406
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:54,120
And blaming popular science for that
would be like blaming me for killing

407
00:10:54,121 --> 00:10:56,790
Indians and to be truthful like
there's worst stuff in that.

408
00:10:56,791 --> 00:10:57,870
And the history of pumping science.

409
00:10:57,871 --> 00:10:58,410
We have tea,

410
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:02,220
we have a cover in the middle of World
War Two that has a this like cartoonish

411
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:04,050
caricature of a Japanese.

412
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:04,890
Yeah.

413
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:05,430
And the,

414
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:06,150
and his,

415
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:10,410
if you look at the Google a archive that
we have and bracket it on either side

416
00:11:10,411 --> 00:11:15,411
of that man's face is you know how we're
going to drop missiles from you know,

417
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:16,343
tanks,

418
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:17,490
fighter jets,

419
00:11:17,491 --> 00:11:18,031
you know,

420
00:11:18,031 --> 00:11:21,300
like there was everything is military
hardware and I decided to look at the

421
00:11:21,301 --> 00:11:22,980
archives of pumps and I
said is to look at a uh,

422
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:27,090
like an art project that is the history
of America and what we were thinking

423
00:11:27,091 --> 00:11:27,631
about at the time,

424
00:11:27,631 --> 00:11:30,240
but written in these really cool covers.

425
00:11:30,241 --> 00:11:31,260
So it's pretty sick.

426
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,250
Back in the day there was so
much more responsibility to,

427
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:38,550
to deliver this kind of
information with all respect.

428
00:11:38,551 --> 00:11:42,030
You would not be on the air in 1936.

429
00:11:42,031 --> 00:11:42,600
Like the,

430
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,190
the access to technology,

431
00:11:44,191 --> 00:11:44,371
right.

432
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:46,200
The fact that you and I get
to have this conversation,

433
00:11:46,201 --> 00:11:46,801
people are listening,

434
00:11:46,801 --> 00:11:47,011
right?

435
00:11:47,011 --> 00:11:48,960
We're just such an amazing
and wonderful thing.

436
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,400
He's so new.

437
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:54,070
I wouldn't have been on the
air in 96 have no real options.

438
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,390
That's interesting in this game.

439
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:56,231
Long enough to know,

440
00:11:56,231 --> 00:11:56,441
right?

441
00:11:56,441 --> 00:11:56,681
Yeah,

442
00:11:56,681 --> 00:11:57,160
that's right.

443
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:57,910
That's right.

444
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:58,330
It's a,

445
00:11:58,330 --> 00:11:58,661
yeah.

446
00:11:58,661 --> 00:11:59,800
It's a whole new world.

447
00:11:59,801 --> 00:11:59,981
And,

448
00:11:59,981 --> 00:12:00,311
and,

449
00:12:00,311 --> 00:12:01,000
uh,

450
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:01,301
uh,

451
00:12:01,301 --> 00:12:01,691
back then,

452
00:12:01,691 --> 00:12:01,841
you know,

453
00:12:01,841 --> 00:12:04,530
the pre Walter Cronkite man to get on air.

454
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:05,840
Holy cow is that heart you,

455
00:12:05,841 --> 00:12:06,161
you know,

456
00:12:06,161 --> 00:12:07,270
the amount of work,

457
00:12:07,271 --> 00:12:10,780
the amount of letter writing
on letters to negotiate,

458
00:12:10,781 --> 00:12:11,080
you know,

459
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,630
whether that guy is going
to be a guest on Cronkite,

460
00:12:13,631 --> 00:12:13,871
you know,

461
00:12:13,871 --> 00:12:14,620
oh my God.

462
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:19,330
And the ability to control the public's
perceptions of things back then was so

463
00:12:19,331 --> 00:12:20,164
complete.

464
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:25,170
Like what Harry Anslinger and William
Randolph Hearst did controlling the,

465
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:26,380
the public's perception on that.

466
00:12:26,381 --> 00:12:27,760
You had to be so,

467
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:28,701
you know,

468
00:12:28,701 --> 00:12:33,040
brilliant and kind of scary to
rise to the top of the money.

469
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:33,930
And you know,

470
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:37,330
especially in the end to have enough of
a fortunate that you lasted through the

471
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:37,331
30s.

472
00:12:37,331 --> 00:12:39,790
Like you gotta be carnivorous human being.

473
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:40,001
You know,

474
00:12:40,001 --> 00:12:41,020
you're a scary dude.

475
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:45,700
And then if you put something in your
magazine or in your newspaper back then,

476
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:46,960
that was doctrine.

477
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:47,500
Well,

478
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:47,710
yeah,

479
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:48,910
but here's the thing where I would say,

480
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:50,320
I see where you're going with it.

481
00:12:50,321 --> 00:12:52,060
And I with you halfway there,

482
00:12:52,061 --> 00:12:53,770
I think the William Randolph
Hearst to the world,

483
00:12:53,771 --> 00:12:53,951
you know,

484
00:12:53,951 --> 00:12:56,290
we're very crazy and very rich
and it was powerful stuff.

485
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:59,770
But the people that you hire in
to run your editorial product,

486
00:12:59,771 --> 00:12:59,981
you know,

487
00:12:59,981 --> 00:13:03,310
or you the person you hire in to
be your publicity guy back then.

488
00:13:03,311 --> 00:13:04,030
I mean you think,

489
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:06,480
think about the generation
that generated Apollo,

490
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:06,741
right?

491
00:13:06,741 --> 00:13:07,331
And all that stuff.

492
00:13:07,331 --> 00:13:07,930
Like those,

493
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:12,010
those guys were raised in the values of
you do the best possible job you can.

494
00:13:12,011 --> 00:13:14,020
You repay hard work with hard work.

495
00:13:14,021 --> 00:13:14,740
And you know,

496
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:15,281
it was,

497
00:13:15,281 --> 00:13:16,330
it was an earnest group.

498
00:13:16,331 --> 00:13:17,164
And so,

499
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:17,920
you know,

500
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,570
I'm looking like my dad,

501
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:20,663
uh,

502
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,220
is a writer.

503
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:22,001
My uncle's a writer,

504
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:25,420
everybody in my family comes out of this
sort of New York magazine world in some

505
00:13:25,421 --> 00:13:26,080
way.

506
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,850
And it's a real meritocracy.

507
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,890
People who are really
trying now that said,

508
00:13:29,891 --> 00:13:30,940
there was a lot of other stuff.

509
00:13:30,941 --> 00:13:31,631
Everybody's white,

510
00:13:31,631 --> 00:13:32,500
everybody's man.

511
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:35,080
Like there's a lot of other
limitations to the good old days,

512
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:35,640
the good old,

513
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:35,801
I mean,

514
00:13:35,801 --> 00:13:36,580
it's what it was.

515
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:37,290
That's what it was,

516
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:38,123
you know?

517
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:38,861
But now,

518
00:13:38,861 --> 00:13:39,131
you know,

519
00:13:39,131 --> 00:13:39,491
it's a,

520
00:13:39,491 --> 00:13:40,880
it's a,

521
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:41,450
you know,

522
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:41,891
but the,

523
00:13:41,891 --> 00:13:44,350
the to now be able to be on the air,

524
00:13:44,351 --> 00:13:44,561
you know,

525
00:13:44,561 --> 00:13:45,221
with you like this,

526
00:13:45,221 --> 00:13:45,910
it's just cool.

527
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:47,410
It's fun and more people can,

528
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,790
can listen to it than ever before.

529
00:13:48,791 --> 00:13:49,750
Everybody can listen to this.

530
00:13:49,751 --> 00:13:50,770
It's all so cool.

531
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,480
I've heard people say
that they believe that,

532
00:13:52,481 --> 00:13:52,750
uh,

533
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:57,310
in today's era the Watergate would have
never happened and that that's sort of a

534
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:00,140
sting operations against some hasn't.

535
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:00,760
Oh my God.

536
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,440
Not only would it not have happened,

537
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:05,620
it would be on 5,000 galaxy s three,

538
00:14:05,621 --> 00:14:06,071
five,

539
00:14:06,071 --> 00:14:07,480
whatever the name of the phones are.

540
00:14:07,481 --> 00:14:07,690
Maybe.

541
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:10,000
So everybody would have filmed it.

542
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:10,330
Yeah.

543
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:12,460
You're not going to able to get
away with anything in the future.

544
00:14:12,461 --> 00:14:16,240
People I'd like everyone to know that's
an important message from Popular

545
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:16,840
Science magazine.

546
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,860
Behave yourself.

547
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:18,970
Uh,

548
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:20,470
law enforcement's about to get serious.

549
00:14:20,471 --> 00:14:22,150
They're going to know
exactly what's going on.

550
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:25,660
Here's a crazy thing that I did a
story a little while ago about this.

551
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:26,583
Um,

552
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:27,940
there's a thing called IARPA,

553
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:28,541
which is a,

554
00:14:28,541 --> 00:14:31,630
and I have to choose my words carefully
cause this is a sort of a complicated

555
00:14:31,631 --> 00:14:32,140
thing but like,

556
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:32,973
or you know,

557
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:33,581
sensitive thing.

558
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:34,414
But anyway,

559
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:35,801
IARPA is a,

560
00:14:35,801 --> 00:14:36,590
is the,

561
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:40,480
it's an advanced research projects
agency for the intelligence community,

562
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:40,811
right?

563
00:14:40,811 --> 00:14:43,060
There's Darpa which does it
for the Defense Department.

564
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:45,250
I are but does it for a coalition,

565
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:46,010
each of like the,

566
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:46,680
you know,

567
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:47,470
the NSF,

568
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:47,891
CIA,

569
00:14:47,891 --> 00:14:51,560
whoever will kick in doe and everybody
funds little incubator projects of

570
00:14:51,561 --> 00:14:52,400
research to see,

571
00:14:52,401 --> 00:14:52,790
you know,

572
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:54,560
can you do stuff and you
basically the way you,

573
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:58,340
what'd you do is you issue a challenge
to the public and you say anybody who

574
00:14:58,341 --> 00:14:58,461
can,

575
00:14:58,461 --> 00:15:00,020
who can do this get to $1 million,

576
00:15:00,021 --> 00:15:00,201
you know,

577
00:15:00,201 --> 00:15:01,430
or whatever the prize is.

578
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:04,730
And that's how robot
cars first started out.

579
00:15:04,731 --> 00:15:05,001
You know,

580
00:15:05,001 --> 00:15:05,834
those guys,

581
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:08,100
the Darpa urban challenges,

582
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:10,340
how these Google's self
driving cars are coming about.

583
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:11,683
But this one,

584
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,270
there were these two projects
that I bumped into and the,

585
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,350
and mind you,

586
00:15:15,351 --> 00:15:15,590
I'm,

587
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:17,870
I can't tell you for sure that these,

588
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:20,150
that the implications of this
are what I think they are.

589
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:22,460
But here's what the
programs themselves do.

590
00:15:22,461 --> 00:15:23,540
The challenge is,

591
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:24,201
uh,

592
00:15:24,201 --> 00:15:25,034
the challenges.

593
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:26,180
Uh,

594
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:31,180
can you identify a visual information
in video basically such that,

595
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:34,280
uh,

596
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,113
if I,

597
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:35,983
um,

598
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:37,550
am looking for,

599
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:37,821
well,

600
00:15:37,821 --> 00:15:38,301
so here's the,

601
00:15:38,301 --> 00:15:38,931
here's the first challenge.

602
00:15:38,931 --> 00:15:41,510
The first challenge is from the
visual information in the photograph,

603
00:15:41,511 --> 00:15:41,591
right?

604
00:15:41,591 --> 00:15:42,830
You're looking at it for a computer,

605
00:15:42,831 --> 00:15:43,641
looks at a photograph,

606
00:15:43,641 --> 00:15:45,590
and from the visual
information inside of it,

607
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:48,650
it knows exactly where
the photo was taken.

608
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:50,240
Whoa.

609
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,073
Does that make sense?

610
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:51,973
Right.

611
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:55,850
Triangulate from the visual
location information and you know,

612
00:15:55,851 --> 00:15:56,061
right.

613
00:15:56,061 --> 00:15:59,720
You got to be a hardcore New Yorker
to be able to spot a photograph of any

614
00:15:59,721 --> 00:16:01,670
corner in New York City and
know exactly where you are.

615
00:16:01,671 --> 00:16:01,881
Right.

616
00:16:01,881 --> 00:16:02,714
That's a hard thing,

617
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,140
right?

618
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:05,720
Imagine a computer designed
just to do that thing,

619
00:16:05,721 --> 00:16:05,901
you know,

620
00:16:05,901 --> 00:16:07,880
a piece of software that
can do exactly that thing.

621
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,450
Would it be able to triangulate in
anywhere in the world based on where the

622
00:16:11,451 --> 00:16:12,300
light sources coming?

623
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:12,980
You don't know?

624
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:13,281
Yeah.

625
00:16:13,281 --> 00:16:13,851
I don't know.

626
00:16:13,851 --> 00:16:16,400
I don't know if it would
know like time of year.

627
00:16:16,401 --> 00:16:16,611
Right.

628
00:16:16,611 --> 00:16:17,444
It might be able to someday.

629
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:17,750
That's,

630
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:18,590
that'll be possible.

631
00:16:18,591 --> 00:16:21,440
Then I think someone was
busted recently with something,

632
00:16:21,441 --> 00:16:23,390
I don't remember the specifics of,

633
00:16:23,391 --> 00:16:23,960
uh,

634
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,250
what it was with someone.

635
00:16:25,251 --> 00:16:28,820
Someone was claiming to be somewhere
when they took a photo and then some

636
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:31,010
analysts looked at the photo and said,

637
00:16:31,011 --> 00:16:35,130
that's not possible because this
photo was taken and this Hematoma,

638
00:16:35,131 --> 00:16:36,770
Taylor and the light source from here.

639
00:16:36,771 --> 00:16:38,420
So it had to be taken in the afternoons.

640
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:38,840
Totally.

641
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:39,471
It's all data,

642
00:16:39,471 --> 00:16:39,651
right?

643
00:16:39,651 --> 00:16:40,790
That data is out there.

644
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:43,580
It's just can you parse that data
fast enough and in this case,

645
00:16:43,581 --> 00:16:45,350
these computer programs or are saying,

646
00:16:45,351 --> 00:16:45,561
okay,

647
00:16:45,561 --> 00:16:46,290
can you triangulate?

648
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:46,701
Everybody has.

649
00:16:46,701 --> 00:16:47,221
Then the other,

650
00:16:47,221 --> 00:16:51,020
another one they're working on
is can you feed a query into the,

651
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:52,420
into the,

652
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:53,750
the data,

653
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:57,170
the database and have it return,

654
00:16:57,470 --> 00:16:57,621
uh,

655
00:16:57,621 --> 00:16:59,030
information not based on,

656
00:16:59,031 --> 00:16:59,181
you know,

657
00:16:59,181 --> 00:16:59,301
how,

658
00:16:59,301 --> 00:17:01,310
like on Youtube you'll see,

659
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,300
uh,

660
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:02,750
you know,

661
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:03,620
the tags at the bottom,

662
00:17:03,621 --> 00:17:03,800
right?

663
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:03,951
I mean,

664
00:17:03,951 --> 00:17:06,400
I'm sure on under our pocket pad tags,

665
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:06,891
Joe Rogan,

666
00:17:06,891 --> 00:17:07,370
whatever,

667
00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:10,160
those keywords help everyone's
search and organize it themselves.

668
00:17:10,161 --> 00:17:10,670
Right?

669
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:13,670
But this is a program that can go in
and look at the visual information of

670
00:17:13,671 --> 00:17:14,840
what's being shown in front of it.

671
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:18,410
And be able to come back with a correct,

672
00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:18,801
you know,

673
00:17:18,801 --> 00:17:20,280
a set of photographs or videos that,

674
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,390
that you know,

675
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,360
correspond to those search terms.

676
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:24,650
Google image search.

677
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:29,210
Nowadays you can upload a photo and it
will show you pretty much every similar

678
00:17:29,211 --> 00:17:33,200
photo and show you where that
floaters in both Facebook and Google.

679
00:17:33,201 --> 00:17:34,710
You've got the ones that were the,

680
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:35,241
it says,

681
00:17:35,241 --> 00:17:35,931
who's this,

682
00:17:35,931 --> 00:17:36,141
right?

683
00:17:36,141 --> 00:17:36,310
I,

684
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:38,420
I put pictures of my daughter
up on the end of that,

685
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:38,930
you know,

686
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:39,763
to show my,

687
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:41,540
her grandparents and uh,

688
00:17:41,541 --> 00:17:41,990
you know,

689
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:42,610
uh,

690
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:43,131
it will say,

691
00:17:43,131 --> 00:17:43,821
who is this,

692
00:17:43,821 --> 00:17:44,061
you know,

693
00:17:44,061 --> 00:17:44,481
or whatever.

694
00:17:44,481 --> 00:17:46,010
There's little question
mark over her face like,

695
00:17:46,011 --> 00:17:46,940
who is this little cutie?

696
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:47,511
And I'm like,

697
00:17:47,511 --> 00:17:48,530
I'm not telling you a Google.

698
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,140
Yeah,

699
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:49,661
don't want him to,

700
00:17:49,661 --> 00:17:50,070
I don't want

701
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:50,700
you to know that.

702
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:51,510
On the other hand,

703
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:51,990
Google,

704
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:52,511
you know those,

705
00:17:52,511 --> 00:17:55,380
there were some good hearted engineers
there who probably have a really good,

706
00:17:55,381 --> 00:17:59,100
useful thing for us for being able to
find pictures of your daughter wherever

707
00:17:59,101 --> 00:17:59,521
they are.

708
00:17:59,521 --> 00:17:59,791
I mean,

709
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:00,624
that might be useful.

710
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,620
It would definitely be useful.

711
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:05,490
But it seems like we're resisting
the inevitable with a lot of this.

712
00:18:05,491 --> 00:18:07,320
A retaining privacy rights and things.

713
00:18:07,321 --> 00:18:08,020
Interesting.

714
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:10,200
I had fight should go on maybes.

715
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:10,980
I think it should.

716
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:11,541
I think it shouldn't,

717
00:18:11,541 --> 00:18:12,031
first of all,

718
00:18:12,031 --> 00:18:15,900
because one of the real issues is
that along the way on this fight,

719
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:16,720
the,

720
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,840
the issue is being decided by people.

721
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:21,690
People are deciding whether or
not they can read your email.

722
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:24,090
People in the government
of deciding whether or not
they can listen to your cell

723
00:18:24,091 --> 00:18:27,060
phone and how are they qualified and how
are they moral and how were they better

724
00:18:27,061 --> 00:18:27,420
than you?

725
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:28,650
Or how were they as good as you,

726
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:30,120
we don't know anything about them,

727
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:31,830
but yet they can look at your Dick Pics.

728
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:32,220
Yeah,

729
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:32,941
you're totally right.

730
00:18:32,941 --> 00:18:33,421
You know what I'm saying?

731
00:18:33,421 --> 00:18:33,541
I mean,

732
00:18:33,541 --> 00:18:34,374
if that's wrong.

733
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:34,581
And,

734
00:18:34,581 --> 00:18:37,020
and how did they get government person,

735
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:37,270
right?

736
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:37,590
I mean,

737
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:41,190
are they really ambitious and are they
really ethical or are they someone who

738
00:18:41,191 --> 00:18:42,660
really seeks to change the world?

739
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:44,880
Or are they just some Schlub who,

740
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:45,580
you know,

741
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:48,720
backhand that is way up to the top
and now he's reading your email?

742
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,170
I like to believe that the people I,

743
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:50,461
you know,

744
00:18:50,461 --> 00:18:52,950
I believe in civic institutions.

745
00:18:52,951 --> 00:18:54,330
I believe they really can function,

746
00:18:54,331 --> 00:18:55,980
especially when they come
out of the generation.

747
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:56,191
It's,

748
00:18:56,191 --> 00:18:56,580
you know,

749
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:57,780
two generations ago,

750
00:18:57,810 --> 00:18:58,021
you know,

751
00:18:58,021 --> 00:18:58,960
there's some nice stuff.

752
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:02,880
Just there's some good dutiful
people still in this world,

753
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:03,181
you know,

754
00:19:03,181 --> 00:19:03,750
and I'm,

755
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,730
I'm very cynical about that stuff too,

756
00:19:05,731 --> 00:19:06,180
but I,

757
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:06,810
I,

758
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:08,040
I'm surprised how often,

759
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,540
like I was just a thing the other day,

760
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:10,170
uh,

761
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:12,180
at the U S Air Force Academy in Colorado.

762
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,080
It was a,

763
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:13,470
uh,

764
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:15,690
one of these challenge programs
and he's very students,

765
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:16,320
you know,

766
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,110
young like undergraduate
age air force cadets,

767
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:19,740
you know,

768
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:20,880
marines where they were.

769
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,420
We're coming forward with their like
cool science fair project basically.

770
00:19:24,421 --> 00:19:26,910
And this little panel of generals
were saying this one or that one,

771
00:19:26,911 --> 00:19:27,744
it was very cool.

772
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:28,411
But,

773
00:19:28,411 --> 00:19:28,920
uh,

774
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:29,753
um,

775
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:30,810
at the beginning of it,

776
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:33,240
the guy who is running the show,

777
00:19:33,241 --> 00:19:34,140
the MC or whatever,

778
00:19:34,141 --> 00:19:34,974
you know,

779
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,570
military solid and ordered Mc is,

780
00:19:36,571 --> 00:19:37,080
but,

781
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:37,560
uh,

782
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,090
stands up and says,

783
00:19:39,091 --> 00:19:39,710
hello,

784
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:39,990
you know,

785
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:40,800
describes the attorney.

786
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,011
I said,

787
00:19:41,011 --> 00:19:41,850
but before I begin,

788
00:19:41,851 --> 00:19:45,540
I'd like everyone in the room to take a
look at the emergency exits over to your

789
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:46,050
left.

790
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:48,210
And then there's one in the back
and then there's one over here.

791
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,980
And as he pointed at each place,

792
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,030
everyone in the room,

793
00:19:51,031 --> 00:19:51,870
military cadets,

794
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:55,320
look to the one on the right and the
one behind them and the one on the left,

795
00:19:55,321 --> 00:19:55,501
you know,

796
00:19:55,501 --> 00:19:55,701
they're,

797
00:19:55,701 --> 00:19:56,670
they're totally,

798
00:19:57,150 --> 00:19:57,620
uh,

799
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:59,460
and it turns out like when
you go with the program,

800
00:19:59,461 --> 00:20:00,450
sometimes good things result.

801
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:00,871
It's cool.

802
00:20:00,871 --> 00:20:03,150
Like to be in a place where
when things catch fire,

803
00:20:03,151 --> 00:20:05,400
everyone runs for the exit in
the way that you're supposed to.

804
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:05,671
You know,

805
00:20:05,671 --> 00:20:06,504
like these,

806
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:07,530
like a rap concert.

807
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:09,090
Sure.

808
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:09,390
Right.

809
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:09,601
But,

810
00:20:09,601 --> 00:20:09,811
you know,

811
00:20:09,811 --> 00:20:10,381
it's just cool.

812
00:20:10,381 --> 00:20:11,910
I find some of that order,

813
00:20:11,911 --> 00:20:12,061
you know,

814
00:20:12,061 --> 00:20:13,410
if you meet like a test pilot,

815
00:20:13,411 --> 00:20:15,630
those guys are just money.

816
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:17,580
That's the world's most reliable person.

817
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:18,060
You know,

818
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:19,110
I definitely believe in destiny,

819
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:20,340
not with a bottle of whiskey and,

820
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:21,223
but yeah,

821
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,670
I believe in the order and
I believe in discipline,

822
00:20:23,671 --> 00:20:26,080
but I don't believe in other
people controlling people.

823
00:20:26,081 --> 00:20:26,131
Well,

824
00:20:26,131 --> 00:20:26,520
that's right.

825
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,330
That's the real issue.

826
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:28,200
That's exactly right.

827
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:28,920
That's exactly right.

828
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:29,581
Imposing you,

829
00:20:29,581 --> 00:20:30,870
imposing your values on me.

830
00:20:30,871 --> 00:20:31,680
It's not okay.

831
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,220
Right.

832
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:32,590
And,

833
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:36,990
and posing the ability to control
people by having their inflammation,

834
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:37,550
right.

835
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:37,980
It's just,

836
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:41,670
it gets into weird areas when you don't
know the motives of the people looking

837
00:20:41,671 --> 00:20:42,610
for the search or who's,

838
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:45,230
it's just so gray as
to who's allowed that.

839
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:46,141
And now that the,

840
00:20:46,141 --> 00:20:46,980
this government,

841
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:50,770
this administration has made it so that
there's all sorts of Wa warrantless

842
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:52,053
wiretapping,

843
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:52,180
uh,

844
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:53,013
more,

845
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,090
uh,

846
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:54,923
um,

847
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:58,720
arrests and the ability to detain
citizens without any due process.

848
00:20:58,721 --> 00:21:00,370
You have to have a lawyer anymore.

849
00:21:00,371 --> 00:21:02,740
You don't all the checks and
balances that were in place.

850
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:04,150
So like someone's people,

851
00:21:04,151 --> 00:21:07,600
a lot of people unfairly think that
if you criticize the way things are,

852
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:08,110
it's like,

853
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:08,501
oh,

854
00:21:08,501 --> 00:21:09,570
he's an anarchist.

855
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:09,740
Oh,

856
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:11,380
he absolutely not.

857
00:21:11,381 --> 00:21:11,541
I,

858
00:21:11,541 --> 00:21:14,470
I believe there should be a
system of checks and balances,

859
00:21:14,471 --> 00:21:16,000
but I also believe there should be cops.

860
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:17,500
I believe they should be lawyers.

861
00:21:17,501 --> 00:21:18,220
There should be judges.

862
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:18,931
This should be jails.

863
00:21:18,931 --> 00:21:19,764
Cause people,

864
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:21,250
human nature is that,

865
00:21:21,251 --> 00:21:21,570
you know,

866
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:23,500
in the real world,

867
00:21:23,501 --> 00:21:24,190
people fuck up.

868
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:24,521
Totally.

869
00:21:24,521 --> 00:21:25,850
I mean we're,

870
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:27,700
I'm quite excited about the amount of,

871
00:21:27,701 --> 00:21:28,121
like you were saying,

872
00:21:28,121 --> 00:21:29,140
Watergate could never have happened.

873
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:29,321
Right.

874
00:21:29,321 --> 00:21:31,090
We'd get been caught so quickly,

875
00:21:31,091 --> 00:21:31,540
right.

876
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:32,410
The amount of,

877
00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:33,580
of sort of,

878
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:34,503
um,

879
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:34,751
you know,

880
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:37,990
just the number of eyes on us right now
mean that people are going to behave

881
00:21:37,991 --> 00:21:38,824
with some more and more,

882
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:43,830
but only if there is the threat of
punishment for messing around with that.

883
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:44,371
And,

884
00:21:44,371 --> 00:21:45,860
and so I think that as,

885
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,020
as much as I want,

886
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:48,070
you know,

887
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:48,903
these incredible,

888
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:49,181
you know,

889
00:21:49,181 --> 00:21:49,691
services,

890
00:21:49,691 --> 00:21:50,481
the kinds of things that you,

891
00:21:50,481 --> 00:21:50,711
you know,

892
00:21:50,711 --> 00:21:52,180
cheap software,

893
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:53,740
a chief cheap website hosting,

894
00:21:53,741 --> 00:21:54,670
it's a great idea,

895
00:21:54,671 --> 00:21:55,504
you know,

896
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,910
the cheapening of democratizing
of stuff like your,

897
00:21:57,911 --> 00:21:58,900
your sponsors or you know,

898
00:21:58,910 --> 00:21:59,021
uh,

899
00:21:59,021 --> 00:22:00,040
represent that kind of thing.

900
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,273
Um,

901
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:03,070
but in order for that to happen,

902
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:04,300
you have to have the threat of law.

903
00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:07,450
You have to have that or
the threat of anonymous.

904
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:08,550
I think,

905
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:08,790
you know,

906
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:13,790
one of the things that I love about the
Internet is the rise of citizen activism

907
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:19,740
and people who have looked the morality
of the anonymous Internet is pretty

908
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:21,370
outstanding.

909
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:25,000
If you stop and think about the people
that that anonymous have gone after,

910
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:25,421
you know,

911
00:22:25,421 --> 00:22:28,780
they've gone after some really fucked up
people and they've kind of decided as a

912
00:22:28,781 --> 00:22:29,614
group,

913
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:32,950
you sort of just through the Internet
without even meeting in person,

914
00:22:32,951 --> 00:22:33,161
yeah,

915
00:22:33,161 --> 00:22:34,180
this is fucked up.

916
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:35,350
Let's expose this,

917
00:22:35,351 --> 00:22:36,370
let's go after this.

918
00:22:36,371 --> 00:22:41,170
And I think that's really encouraging
because people are anonymous and they're,

919
00:22:41,171 --> 00:22:41,530
you know,

920
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:45,010
they just have the choice to do whatever
they want online and yet they decided

921
00:22:45,011 --> 00:22:45,970
to try to right wrongs.

922
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:49,270
It's the most evolved form of democracy,

923
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:49,631
right?

924
00:22:49,631 --> 00:22:51,070
It is so granular.

925
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:51,320
Yeah.

926
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:51,640
Like,

927
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:51,911
you know,

928
00:22:51,911 --> 00:22:56,560
you've got a reliable way of measuring
public approval or disapproval on almost

929
00:22:56,561 --> 00:23:00,220
any subject you can think of by
virtue of comments and the forums,

930
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:00,670
you know,

931
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:03,730
the participation that
we're all suddenly having.

932
00:23:03,731 --> 00:23:04,000
I mean,

933
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,420
it turns out when you take away the
worry about being shamed in public,

934
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:08,680
people really,

935
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,513
you know,

936
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:10,480
do bold things.

937
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,180
They go out there and they
write manifestos and yeah,

938
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,110
you know,

939
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:15,220
there's so many.

940
00:23:15,221 --> 00:23:16,750
I'm supposed to go off and do this,

941
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:17,520
uh,

942
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,010
uh,

943
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:18,611
speech to,

944
00:23:18,611 --> 00:23:18,830
uh,

945
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:19,540
uh,

946
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:20,373
uh,

947
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:21,520
my college,

948
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:23,170
a writers conference.

949
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:25,540
And I was asked in advance,

950
00:23:25,541 --> 00:23:25,721
you know,

951
00:23:25,721 --> 00:23:26,200
what's the,

952
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,880
what's it like to be a writer now?

953
00:23:27,881 --> 00:23:28,350
Is this a,

954
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:28,600
you know,

955
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,490
what is the state of
writing now or whatever.

956
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:33,070
And my feeling is it's like,

957
00:23:33,071 --> 00:23:34,810
it's so nice to be,

958
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:36,220
it's such a good time.

959
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:37,510
I didn't say this,

960
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:38,380
somebody else originated this,

961
00:23:38,381 --> 00:23:39,260
but um,

962
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:39,941
to be,

963
00:23:39,941 --> 00:23:43,040
it's so much of a better time to be a
reader now than it ever has been before.

964
00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:43,570
You know,

965
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:46,100
so much cool stuff to
read because everyone

966
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:46,490
can write,

967
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:47,690
everyone can get into print.

968
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:52,750
I read this the other day that 90% of the
world's data was generated in the last

969
00:23:53,481 --> 00:23:54,314
two years.

970
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:54,980
Sure.

971
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:56,930
It's unbelievable how much data there is.

972
00:23:56,931 --> 00:23:57,530
Right.

973
00:23:57,530 --> 00:23:58,161
And we can't,

974
00:23:58,161 --> 00:23:59,270
and it's a fire hose.

975
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:00,590
We don't really know how to Parse it.

976
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:01,070
Yeah.

977
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:04,190
Twitter is so primitive compared to
what we're going to have in 10 years.

978
00:24:04,191 --> 00:24:05,990
You know what is going to be the next one?

979
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:06,501
That's a,

980
00:24:06,501 --> 00:24:07,670
I never saw Twitter coming.

981
00:24:07,671 --> 00:24:08,504
I never thought,

982
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:09,620
even when it came out I was like,

983
00:24:09,621 --> 00:24:09,891
okay,

984
00:24:09,891 --> 00:24:10,730
what the fuck is that?

985
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:15,500
I know 140 character text messaging to
anonymous people like that doesn't make

986
00:24:15,501 --> 00:24:15,970
any sense.

987
00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:16,271
Right.

988
00:24:16,271 --> 00:24:19,480
And the the Guy Jack Dorsey who founded
Twitter has this brilliant thing where

989
00:24:19,481 --> 00:24:22,000
basically he was geeking out on uh,

990
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:23,980
the patterns of cities.

991
00:24:23,981 --> 00:24:25,520
He was way into um,

992
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,473
uh,

993
00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:27,190
uh,

994
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:29,890
police scanners and stuff
and was tracking the,

995
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:33,820
the signals that I'm like Limo
Services Ping back and forth.

996
00:24:33,821 --> 00:24:36,970
He was just interested in the like the
the flow of information that is generated

997
00:24:36,971 --> 00:24:41,971
by cities and he saw that ambulances and
limo services and delivery trucks have

998
00:24:42,761 --> 00:24:44,890
a system for saying where are you?

999
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:46,540
And then the truck could says back,

1000
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:47,493
here I am,

1001
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:47,891
you know,

1002
00:24:47,891 --> 00:24:48,090
there,

1003
00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:50,170
there needs to be a system
like that everywhere.

1004
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:52,720
And his thing was let's give it to people.

1005
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:56,020
People don't have a system for reporting
in their location and their status.

1006
00:24:56,610 --> 00:24:58,260
That's where status updates came from.

1007
00:24:58,290 --> 00:25:00,960
It's interesting cause that's what it
used to be but it's not really that

1008
00:25:00,961 --> 00:25:01,501
anymore.

1009
00:25:01,501 --> 00:25:02,670
What it's evolved to now,

1010
00:25:02,671 --> 00:25:03,750
at least on my Twitter,

1011
00:25:03,751 --> 00:25:08,660
my Twitter is all fascinating articles
that people send me that I retweet or

1012
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:11,470
your neighborhood at Twitter
is different than mine.

1013
00:25:11,471 --> 00:25:12,430
It's really interesting.

1014
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:14,560
I've already acquainted
with your father's not mine.

1015
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:15,200
Oh Damn.

1016
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,033
Like you know,

1017
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:17,620
you get slaughtered up in here.

1018
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:19,150
If you do something wrong,

1019
00:25:19,151 --> 00:25:19,820
it's,

1020
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:20,120
yeah,

1021
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:22,660
there's the light popular science.

1022
00:25:22,661 --> 00:25:23,760
Reduce this,

1023
00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:24,041
this,

1024
00:25:24,041 --> 00:25:24,761
these are freaks.

1025
00:25:24,761 --> 00:25:29,680
These are people out there on the fringes
with shotguns in the wrong aware when

1026
00:25:29,681 --> 00:25:30,461
the zombies attack.

1027
00:25:30,461 --> 00:25:31,360
I want your guys,

1028
00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:32,800
that's why guys can't help me.

1029
00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:33,371
That's right.

1030
00:25:33,371 --> 00:25:35,210
They know how to read our candidates,

1031
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:36,053
how to hunt.

1032
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:38,020
My guys would actually devise something,

1033
00:25:38,021 --> 00:25:40,540
some piece of software that lets you
control the Gatling gun and we'd all be

1034
00:25:40,541 --> 00:25:40,840
saved.

1035
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:40,961
Well,

1036
00:25:40,961 --> 00:25:43,990
your guys would devise a new method
of power that didn't rely on oil.

1037
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,273
Get together.

1038
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:47,290
Zombies will be burning wood.

1039
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:50,140
We'll have zombies like
walking on treadmills forever.

1040
00:25:50,141 --> 00:25:50,980
Generating power.

1041
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:51,820
Yeah,

1042
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:54,070
put a Zombie in a dog collar
and we can go to work for you.

1043
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:57,010
Like a durable popular
science was the only magazine.

1044
00:25:57,011 --> 00:26:00,580
My Dad's and to you as a kid
growing up like since the 70s,

1045
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,433
what was your dad?

1046
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:02,500
What'd your dad do for a living?

1047
00:26:02,501 --> 00:26:03,190
It was an engineer.

1048
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:03,341
Oh,

1049
00:26:03,341 --> 00:26:03,521
cool.

1050
00:26:03,521 --> 00:26:03,731
Yeah.

1051
00:26:03,731 --> 00:26:04,564
What kind of engineer?

1052
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:04,870
Uh,

1053
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:09,490
he builds huge batteries and backups
and stuff like that and huge dragons for

1054
00:26:09,491 --> 00:26:10,301
huge companies.

1055
00:26:10,301 --> 00:26:11,040
Like that's great.

1056
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:11,230
Yeah.

1057
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:12,810
He's tried to retire several times.

1058
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:13,120
He's like,

1059
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,830
I'm the master electrical engineer.

1060
00:26:14,831 --> 00:26:15,011
Yeah,

1061
00:26:15,011 --> 00:26:16,360
I bet he's in part of the old breed.

1062
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:16,781
That's right.

1063
00:26:16,781 --> 00:26:17,614
He knows what he's,

1064
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:18,181
what he's doing.

1065
00:26:18,181 --> 00:26:18,370
Yeah.

1066
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:18,970
That's so cool.

1067
00:26:18,970 --> 00:26:21,040
Now you guys have
transferred onto the IPAD.

1068
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:21,430
Yeah.

1069
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:24,250
Now have you noticed the
subscription that paper based,

1070
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:24,810
uh,

1071
00:26:24,810 --> 00:26:25,351
is,

1072
00:26:25,351 --> 00:26:27,670
is dying for shirts or is it,

1073
00:26:27,671 --> 00:26:28,990
here's what's so great about being,

1074
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:30,060
about working with probably the science,

1075
00:26:30,061 --> 00:26:33,220
and this is why I'm so lucky to this
magazine I've inherited because there's a

1076
00:26:33,221 --> 00:26:33,770
lot of magazines,

1077
00:26:33,770 --> 00:26:36,430
a lot of problems of science is just like,

1078
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:38,290
it's a universally beloved brand.

1079
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:42,780
Like even people who don't
read it actively know or
have never even read no one.

1080
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:43,410
It's,

1081
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:43,741
you know,

1082
00:26:43,741 --> 00:26:44,440
like,

1083
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:47,700
and so it's such a cool universal thing
to just walk in anywhere and be like

1084
00:26:47,701 --> 00:26:48,211
Papa Science.

1085
00:26:48,211 --> 00:26:48,600
And it was like,

1086
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:48,880
oh my,

1087
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:49,321
you stood by,

1088
00:26:49,321 --> 00:26:49,561
you know,

1089
00:26:49,561 --> 00:26:50,460
my dad reads that,

1090
00:26:50,461 --> 00:26:50,671
you know,

1091
00:26:50,671 --> 00:26:51,504
whatever it is.

1092
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:55,950
And there's a cool sort of a
hipster subset of like guys like me.

1093
00:26:55,951 --> 00:26:57,780
I think that's what I imagine,

1094
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:58,770
uh,

1095
00:26:58,770 --> 00:26:59,251
you know,

1096
00:26:59,251 --> 00:26:59,461
who,

1097
00:26:59,461 --> 00:27:01,320
who are starting to pick
it up in their twenties,

1098
00:27:01,321 --> 00:27:01,591
you know,

1099
00:27:01,591 --> 00:27:04,500
dig it as like just a thing
to sort of geek out on.

1100
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:09,300
But it's got a really loyal
following in every medium.

1101
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:09,781
Basically.

1102
00:27:09,781 --> 00:27:10,200
There's this,

1103
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:10,590
you know,

1104
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:10,930
there's a,

1105
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:13,110
the veracious Internet hoards,

1106
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:13,920
you know,

1107
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:14,400
uh,

1108
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,850
seizing massive of Internet guys
come to our site and are really,

1109
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:18,221
you know,

1110
00:27:18,221 --> 00:27:18,631
brutal.

1111
00:27:18,631 --> 00:27:19,381
If we get it wrong,

1112
00:27:19,381 --> 00:27:19,771
they're great.

1113
00:27:19,771 --> 00:27:20,220
I mean,

1114
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:22,050
exactly the kind of
engaged on as you want.

1115
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:25,050
And in print we have people who,

1116
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:25,351
you know,

1117
00:27:25,351 --> 00:27:27,300
that we pour a lot of effort
into the print magazine.

1118
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:28,380
We really try and uphold,

1119
00:27:28,410 --> 00:27:28,591
you know,

1120
00:27:28,591 --> 00:27:29,610
you're paying money for it.

1121
00:27:29,611 --> 00:27:30,041
So man,

1122
00:27:30,041 --> 00:27:31,980
I'm working to make it as good as I can.

1123
00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:32,940
I'm glad it's still exist.

1124
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:34,350
It's in print form.

1125
00:27:34,351 --> 00:27:35,640
It's great to take on an airplane.

1126
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:36,390
You know,

1127
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:37,223
it's great to,

1128
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:38,051
it's a,

1129
00:27:38,051 --> 00:27:39,630
it's beautiful visually,

1130
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:40,531
you know,

1131
00:27:40,531 --> 00:27:42,480
and you can find out so much about it.

1132
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:43,441
Various things.

1133
00:27:43,441 --> 00:27:46,170
Now this episode that you're
a or issue or that you're a,

1134
00:27:46,171 --> 00:27:47,910
you're promoting is the brain issues,

1135
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:48,631
brain issues.

1136
00:27:48,631 --> 00:27:49,464
So,

1137
00:27:49,530 --> 00:27:50,363
uh,

1138
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:51,413
you know,

1139
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:52,463
it's,

1140
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,580
it's an amazing,

1141
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:55,860
what's so cool about working about besides
that we get to touch on everything,

1142
00:27:55,861 --> 00:27:56,041
right?

1143
00:27:56,041 --> 00:27:56,880
We can do robots.

1144
00:27:56,881 --> 00:27:57,091
We got,

1145
00:27:57,091 --> 00:27:57,870
I mean literally I can,

1146
00:27:57,870 --> 00:28:00,900
I would come here anytime you want
to cause when we could talk forever.

1147
00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:01,530
Dog.

1148
00:28:01,530 --> 00:28:01,980
Sure.

1149
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:02,790
Really Fun.

1150
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:03,623
Call me dog.

1151
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,113
Uh,

1152
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:05,761
so,

1153
00:28:05,761 --> 00:28:06,300
uh,

1154
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:07,133
the,

1155
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:07,561
you know,

1156
00:28:07,561 --> 00:28:10,890
the brain is one of many
subjects we covered this one is,

1157
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:11,490
um,

1158
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:12,300
uh,

1159
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:12,780
you know,

1160
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:16,440
what's amazing about it is how little we
actually know when we are just starting

1161
00:28:16,441 --> 00:28:17,400
to noodle around.

1162
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:18,480
Uh,

1163
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:18,840
you know,

1164
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:21,630
just around the sort of the
basic functions of the brain.

1165
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:27,020
We don't really have any idea
how personality is built.

1166
00:28:27,061 --> 00:28:27,331
You know,

1167
00:28:27,331 --> 00:28:28,380
I mean we have some idea,

1168
00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:28,711
you know,

1169
00:28:28,711 --> 00:28:30,150
but like the subtleties,

1170
00:28:30,151 --> 00:28:31,320
like why we get along,

1171
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:31,681
whatever,

1172
00:28:31,681 --> 00:28:36,150
all that stuff is totally unknown
in terms of how the brain functions,

1173
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:41,400
but already just by literally poking
at the brain with Zapping it and stuff,

1174
00:28:41,610 --> 00:28:44,070
we can do amazing things already,

1175
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:44,371
you know,

1176
00:28:44,371 --> 00:28:48,240
like ease the symptoms of terrible
diseases and do all kinds of crazy stuff.

1177
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:49,501
But Hey,

1178
00:28:49,501 --> 00:28:51,090
before we get into the details of that,

1179
00:28:51,091 --> 00:28:51,380
cause I,

1180
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:51,570
I,

1181
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:53,130
here's the like,

1182
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:54,040
can we talk about,

1183
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:54,270
uh,

1184
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:55,680
something I actually
wanted to ask you about,

1185
00:28:55,681 --> 00:28:56,400
which is,

1186
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,210
um,

1187
00:28:57,210 --> 00:28:59,250
sort of fear in general,

1188
00:28:59,251 --> 00:29:00,180
the psychology,

1189
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:00,610
like,

1190
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:03,810
just thinking about like the subtleties
of personality and the brain in general.

1191
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:06,060
I'm really interested by the,

1192
00:29:06,061 --> 00:29:11,061
like how different a person I am from
the people that can handle fear in any

1193
00:29:12,271 --> 00:29:12,720
real way.

1194
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,201
And you,

1195
00:29:13,201 --> 00:29:13,561
I know,

1196
00:29:13,561 --> 00:29:15,690
have you had to watch people be really,

1197
00:29:15,691 --> 00:29:17,070
really good for living,

1198
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,030
you know,

1199
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:18,390
uh,

1200
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:19,960
and still do really,

1201
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:20,190
uh,

1202
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:20,820
even more.

1203
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:21,690
And even more so now,

1204
00:29:21,691 --> 00:29:22,051
I was kissing.

1205
00:29:22,051 --> 00:29:23,610
Now as a matter of now that you're,

1206
00:29:23,611 --> 00:29:24,540
you're really doing,

1207
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:25,051
you know,

1208
00:29:25,051 --> 00:29:25,830
absorbed,

1209
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:26,161
excuse me,

1210
00:29:26,161 --> 00:29:27,510
observing a sport that you love.

1211
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:28,290
Uh,

1212
00:29:28,290 --> 00:29:33,290
you see like how the people for me who
can train themselves to be unafraid or

1213
00:29:35,401 --> 00:29:39,870
can channel their fear in the face of
getting pummeled by an by a big person,

1214
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:42,040
but big dude like is an

1215
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:42,873
amazing thing to me.

1216
00:29:43,090 --> 00:29:48,090
And how that trait is expressed
physically in the brain versus how,

1217
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:48,431
you know,

1218
00:29:48,431 --> 00:29:49,450
a guy like me who's like,

1219
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:49,991
fuck dude,

1220
00:29:49,991 --> 00:29:51,760
I'll give you any money I've got.

1221
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:52,720
Don't beat me up.

1222
00:29:52,721 --> 00:29:52,961
You know,

1223
00:29:52,961 --> 00:29:54,550
like I'm not a fighter.

1224
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:55,780
Uh,

1225
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:57,460
the difference between our brains,

1226
00:29:57,461 --> 00:29:58,600
like who knows what that is?

1227
00:29:58,601 --> 00:29:59,800
That's definitely so subtle,

1228
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:01,870
but you don't need to be a,

1229
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:05,140
you don't need to have the ability
to perform under pressure like that.

1230
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:05,770
We don't think.

1231
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:06,071
No.

1232
00:30:06,071 --> 00:30:06,881
But if you did,

1233
00:30:06,881 --> 00:30:07,714
you would,

1234
00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:08,141
you know,

1235
00:30:08,141 --> 00:30:10,720
if your life depended on it and if you
were in some sort of a walking dead

1236
00:30:10,721 --> 00:30:12,910
situation and you had to deal with fear,

1237
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:13,983
you would deal with it.

1238
00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:15,460
Think there's two kinds of people.

1239
00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:16,323
Basically,

1240
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:17,170
there's two kinds of,

1241
00:30:17,170 --> 00:30:17,870
I'm sorry.

1242
00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:18,300
Right.

1243
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:18,430
No,

1244
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:19,460
I'm saying to come through,

1245
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:19,970
right?

1246
00:30:19,970 --> 00:30:22,490
You're thinking just
one kind of person and,

1247
00:30:22,770 --> 00:30:24,100
and it's just the choices you make.

1248
00:30:24,130 --> 00:30:24,340
Yeah.

1249
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:26,650
There's survivors or people who die.

1250
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:27,400
I mean,

1251
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,200
literally there's no,

1252
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:32,950
during most exchanges
in civilized society,

1253
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:35,260
there's no need to be
afraid of other people.

1254
00:30:35,261 --> 00:30:37,330
There's no need to be afraid
of violent altercations.

1255
00:30:37,331 --> 00:30:38,320
It's very rare.

1256
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:40,690
Unless you're in terrible environments,

1257
00:30:40,691 --> 00:30:41,740
unless you're in war,

1258
00:30:41,741 --> 00:30:42,580
unless you're in really,

1259
00:30:42,581 --> 00:30:43,600
really bad neighborhoods,

1260
00:30:43,870 --> 00:30:45,970
most likely you're going to
be safe in San Francisco.

1261
00:30:45,971 --> 00:30:48,670
Just go into your job and
interacting with human beings.

1262
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:49,480
Yeah.

1263
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,740
But when you,

1264
00:30:50,770 --> 00:30:53,710
you're forced to in a day to day basis,

1265
00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:55,570
overcome stress and fear,

1266
00:30:55,571 --> 00:30:57,310
and it becomes a part of your reality.

1267
00:30:57,311 --> 00:31:00,800
And once it becomes part of your
reality in terms of performance,

1268
00:31:00,801 --> 00:31:01,110
it,

1269
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:02,080
it also becomes,

1270
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:03,333
uh,

1271
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:05,230
something that you kind
of have to be inoculated.

1272
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:05,660
Right?

1273
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:05,930
Right,

1274
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:06,110
right,

1275
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:06,240
right.

1276
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,520
You start off slowly and
like even stand up comedy.

1277
00:31:09,521 --> 00:31:10,680
The first time I tried to stand up tall,

1278
00:31:10,930 --> 00:31:11,490
terrified.

1279
00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:12,130
Terrified.

1280
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:13,390
Now I know I'm not scared at all.

1281
00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:14,110
Now it's fun.

1282
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:17,120
And that is like part of you.

1283
00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:17,490
You,

1284
00:31:17,490 --> 00:31:18,610
you've got to be competent,

1285
00:31:18,611 --> 00:31:20,110
you gotta have your bases covered.

1286
00:31:20,530 --> 00:31:22,750
And I remember competing
as a martial artist,

1287
00:31:22,751 --> 00:31:26,980
there was a big difference between how I
felt when I was really prepared and how

1288
00:31:26,981 --> 00:31:30,730
I felt if I was injured or if I was sick
or if there was something wrong or if I

1289
00:31:30,731 --> 00:31:31,870
didn't train hard enough.

1290
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:33,400
When when you have doubts,

1291
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:35,290
that's when you're in a really bad place.

1292
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:38,380
I would say though that the
raw materials are distinctive.

1293
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:41,470
I mean we can agree right that the were
all physical materials of people are,

1294
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:42,423
are you know,

1295
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:43,470
distinct from one another.

1296
00:31:43,471 --> 00:31:43,840
Like my,

1297
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:46,510
my wife is an Olympic who
was an Olympic hopeful,

1298
00:31:46,511 --> 00:31:47,010
she was uh,

1299
00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:47,410
uh,

1300
00:31:47,410 --> 00:31:50,080
a track and field runner and uh,

1301
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:51,543
you know,

1302
00:31:51,850 --> 00:31:54,460
her body and its strength.

1303
00:31:54,461 --> 00:31:55,540
I mean she had a 30 inch vertical,

1304
00:31:55,541 --> 00:31:56,081
she's five,

1305
00:31:56,081 --> 00:31:56,914
eight,

1306
00:31:57,190 --> 00:31:57,461
five,

1307
00:31:57,461 --> 00:31:58,090
nine,

1308
00:31:58,090 --> 00:31:58,390
you know,

1309
00:31:58,390 --> 00:31:59,440
could hang from the rim,

1310
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,790
like has hang time,

1311
00:32:00,791 --> 00:32:01,240
all this stuff.

1312
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:03,880
I used to play ultimate
Frisbee in college,

1313
00:32:03,881 --> 00:32:04,001
you know,

1314
00:32:04,001 --> 00:32:04,211
whatever.

1315
00:32:04,211 --> 00:32:05,400
I took her out a few times to,

1316
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:09,130
to play it with us and like we'd
never had a real athlete play before.

1317
00:32:09,131 --> 00:32:11,050
Like she was out running all the dudes,

1318
00:32:11,051 --> 00:32:11,171
you know,

1319
00:32:11,171 --> 00:32:11,561
all that stuff.

1320
00:32:11,561 --> 00:32:12,040
There's just,

1321
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:14,080
there's distinctions
between people that I think,

1322
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:15,040
uh,

1323
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:15,281
you know,

1324
00:32:15,281 --> 00:32:16,060
are just part of the thing.

1325
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:19,480
And I think there is an expression of
that in the brain that the brain is built

1326
00:32:19,481 --> 00:32:20,410
differently for different things,

1327
00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:23,320
which is not to say that that
is not to say that you're wrong.

1328
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:23,490
No,

1329
00:32:23,490 --> 00:32:23,621
no,

1330
00:32:23,621 --> 00:32:23,771
no.

1331
00:32:23,771 --> 00:32:24,700
But the question is,

1332
00:32:24,701 --> 00:32:28,480
does that have those physical distinctions
from her gifts from the womb or is it

1333
00:32:28,481 --> 00:32:29,670
from constant focus on,

1334
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,540
it's a little about athletic
activity I think is a little bit,

1335
00:32:31,541 --> 00:32:31,751
I mean,

1336
00:32:31,751 --> 00:32:31,931
you know,

1337
00:32:31,931 --> 00:32:32,251
fast,

1338
00:32:32,251 --> 00:32:33,130
which is slow twitch muscles.

1339
00:32:33,131 --> 00:32:33,281
I mean,

1340
00:32:33,281 --> 00:32:33,640
we know,

1341
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:34,760
we know that the difference between that,

1342
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:34,990
like,

1343
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:35,590
you know,

1344
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:38,800
a long cabs versus the ones that
are high and tight and you know,

1345
00:32:38,801 --> 00:32:39,020
there's,

1346
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:40,370
there's jumping ability,

1347
00:32:40,370 --> 00:32:43,250
there's sprinting ability versus
being able to run long distances.

1348
00:32:43,251 --> 00:32:43,700
There's this,

1349
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:45,980
there's just distinctions
between people physically.

1350
00:32:45,981 --> 00:32:49,550
It doesn't mean anything other
than just jeans are out there.

1351
00:32:49,551 --> 00:32:50,301
That's what's amazing.

1352
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:51,620
So with the brain,

1353
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:52,101
with the,

1354
00:32:52,101 --> 00:32:52,491
the,

1355
00:32:52,491 --> 00:32:53,570
the way that it,

1356
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:54,590
uh,

1357
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:55,423
is distinct,

1358
00:32:55,930 --> 00:32:56,181
you know,

1359
00:32:56,181 --> 00:32:57,320
it can do amazing things.

1360
00:32:57,321 --> 00:33:00,050
Like we're literally putting
pins into brains now,

1361
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,420
delivering a little
signal and turning off,

1362
00:33:02,450 --> 00:33:02,751
you know,

1363
00:33:02,751 --> 00:33:05,120
seizures and turning off stuff.

1364
00:33:05,121 --> 00:33:06,470
Like it is triggering memories,

1365
00:33:06,471 --> 00:33:06,950
right?

1366
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:07,191
Yeah.

1367
00:33:07,191 --> 00:33:08,024
Triggering memories.

1368
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:08,450
We,

1369
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:08,841
there's a,

1370
00:33:08,841 --> 00:33:09,290
so,

1371
00:33:09,290 --> 00:33:09,890
so,

1372
00:33:09,890 --> 00:33:10,723
uh,

1373
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:15,530
there's basically a new category of a
thing called a biomechanical engineering

1374
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,210
where they've taken,

1375
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:17,600
you know,

1376
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,920
guys like your dad,

1377
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:19,550
uh,

1378
00:33:19,550 --> 00:33:20,250
who,

1379
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:20,570
uh,

1380
00:33:20,570 --> 00:33:21,201
might have,

1381
00:33:21,201 --> 00:33:21,470
you know,

1382
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:22,970
who liked to tinker and are good at that.

1383
00:33:22,971 --> 00:33:23,600
Right.

1384
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,220
And turn that into a,

1385
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,113
combined them with,

1386
00:33:26,150 --> 00:33:26,660
you know,

1387
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:29,360
a little bit of medical training or maybe
pair them up with a medical student.

1388
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,410
There's programs that do that.

1389
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:31,940
And being a biomechanical engineer,

1390
00:33:31,941 --> 00:33:33,920
they're literally creating little
devices that will do stuff.

1391
00:33:33,921 --> 00:33:34,754
And so in one case,

1392
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:35,570
um,

1393
00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:36,403
the,

1394
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:37,370
uh,

1395
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:39,500
in the case of of dementia,

1396
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:43,070
it's basically putting a pin,

1397
00:33:43,071 --> 00:33:45,210
essentially you imagine
a pin into the brain and,

1398
00:33:45,410 --> 00:33:46,760
and delivering a little jolt.

1399
00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:49,640
But first you have to
pick out the pattern.

1400
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:50,360
Um,

1401
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:51,111
so in this case it was,

1402
00:33:51,111 --> 00:33:52,190
it was monkeys,

1403
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:52,500
uh,

1404
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:53,333
that had,

1405
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:54,470
uh,

1406
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,030
been taught a cartoon game,

1407
00:33:56,031 --> 00:33:58,700
basically like a turnover and
match the cards kind of game.

1408
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,530
And uh,

1409
00:34:00,770 --> 00:34:02,540
when they got it right,

1410
00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:03,530
that signal,

1411
00:34:03,610 --> 00:34:04,970
the computer picked that up,

1412
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:05,180
right.

1413
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:07,370
Software recorded that pattern.

1414
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:08,990
Then later when,

1415
00:34:09,350 --> 00:34:11,540
I don't know if it was the same
monkeys are new Monkees and forgive me,

1416
00:34:11,541 --> 00:34:12,374
but um,

1417
00:34:12,470 --> 00:34:13,850
when they played again,

1418
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:14,660
uh,

1419
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:19,220
they would use the signal to incur it
to stimulate the part of the brain that

1420
00:34:19,221 --> 00:34:20,350
had lit up when they,

1421
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:22,040
when the monkey got it right last time.

1422
00:34:22,430 --> 00:34:27,430
And they found that they could increase
the accuracy of the monkey 10 by 10% on

1423
00:34:28,221 --> 00:34:31,490
a consistent basis by jolting them
right before they were about to make a

1424
00:34:31,491 --> 00:34:31,851
decision,

1425
00:34:31,851 --> 00:34:34,430
like hitting them with whatever
the signal was at that time.

1426
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:37,280
And then this is the
other crazy part of it.

1427
00:34:37,281 --> 00:34:39,300
They then hit those
monkeys with each with a,

1428
00:34:39,301 --> 00:34:41,990
a hit of cocaine and watched their,

1429
00:34:42,170 --> 00:34:42,530
you know,

1430
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:44,390
they fell off by 20%,

1431
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:46,430
basically from their normal
abilities and that game.

1432
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:50,330
Then they started doing this zapping
again and could restore them to normal,

1433
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:51,010
uh,

1434
00:34:51,010 --> 00:34:51,890
ability again.

1435
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:52,640
Right.

1436
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:54,860
So the trouble in this case though,

1437
00:34:54,861 --> 00:34:55,041
I mean,

1438
00:34:55,041 --> 00:34:58,730
are the reason that this is still a decade
or more from being possible in humans

1439
00:34:58,760 --> 00:34:59,930
is we don't know.

1440
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:00,141
You know,

1441
00:35:00,141 --> 00:35:03,300
life is not like a game of flashcards.

1442
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:06,350
You don't know what the signals are that
you're going to want to prompt ahead of

1443
00:35:06,351 --> 00:35:07,184
time or whatever,

1444
00:35:07,490 --> 00:35:10,280
but they think that there's
some memory stuff that might be,

1445
00:35:10,281 --> 00:35:10,650
you know,

1446
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:11,360
that we could in,

1447
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,910
in future sort of improve our memory,

1448
00:35:13,911 --> 00:35:14,121
right?

1449
00:35:14,121 --> 00:35:17,420
You have a little signal processor and a
thing that would zap the right spots of

1450
00:35:17,421 --> 00:35:18,254
the brain or whatever,

1451
00:35:18,290 --> 00:35:19,123
you know,

1452
00:35:19,370 --> 00:35:20,420
could someday.

1453
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:23,070
It really is such a fascinating time,

1454
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:23,580
um,

1455
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:28,580
in regards to what we're saying
earlier about a data and information,

1456
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:33,560
but also in the fact that we still have
so much to learn when it comes to the,

1457
00:35:33,561 --> 00:35:37,620
the human bind and the ability to it,

1458
00:35:37,621 --> 00:35:38,190
which is something

1459
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:40,720
that scientists are really
actively focusing on right now.

1460
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:41,721
I found a,

1461
00:35:41,721 --> 00:35:41,880
a,

1462
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:45,310
an article in your magazine that I
thought it was really amazing where

1463
00:35:45,330 --> 00:35:50,330
scientists had created a tiny artificial
brain that exhibits 12 seconds of short

1464
00:35:51,631 --> 00:35:52,464
term memory.

1465
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:53,783
How nuts is that?

1466
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,233
You know,

1467
00:35:56,890 --> 00:35:58,950
how long before one of
those is in your pocket?

1468
00:35:58,951 --> 00:35:59,400
I know,

1469
00:35:59,400 --> 00:35:59,710
I know.

1470
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:00,000
You know,

1471
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,680
and it has all the information
of the entire universe.

1472
00:36:03,890 --> 00:36:06,420
W I was just hanging out with it.

1473
00:36:06,421 --> 00:36:09,390
This one of these total boy genius kids,

1474
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,233
this guy,

1475
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:12,020
a brilliant gunman,

1476
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,870
aser Raskin very smart dude.

1477
00:36:13,871 --> 00:36:16,570
And he was pointing out a
thing to me about Google,

1478
00:36:16,870 --> 00:36:17,290
uh,

1479
00:36:17,290 --> 00:36:20,020
where evidently one of the chief sort of,

1480
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:20,770
uh,

1481
00:36:20,770 --> 00:36:21,130
you know,

1482
00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:22,720
math officer's essentially of,

1483
00:36:22,721 --> 00:36:23,554
of Google,

1484
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,220
uh,

1485
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:26,170
basically released this paper in 2000,

1486
00:36:26,171 --> 00:36:27,850
2001 that said,

1487
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:28,030
uh,

1488
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:31,030
that it doesn't matter
how good the software is,

1489
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:32,680
data,

1490
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:34,630
the more data you give,

1491
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,880
you're always going to outperform soft,

1492
00:36:36,910 --> 00:36:37,960
even the best software.

1493
00:36:37,961 --> 00:36:42,961
So basically like really good software
given a small Dataset is not as good as

1494
00:36:43,421 --> 00:36:45,850
mediocre software given a huge Dataset,

1495
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:46,690
right?

1496
00:36:46,690 --> 00:36:50,470
And so data is what is what gives
you your correct answers every time.

1497
00:36:50,471 --> 00:36:53,130
So you don't in fact need the
little brain what you needed,

1498
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:55,810
a little device that connects
to the whole big brain,

1499
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:56,140
right.

1500
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:56,411
To the,

1501
00:36:56,411 --> 00:36:58,060
like the world of,

1502
00:36:58,110 --> 00:36:58,860
of data around.

1503
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:00,950
That's sort of analogous
to an educated person.

1504
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:01,370
Right.

1505
00:37:01,370 --> 00:37:01,671
You know,

1506
00:37:01,671 --> 00:37:02,070
I mean,

1507
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:02,270
uh,

1508
00:37:02,270 --> 00:37:03,530
if a person is a,

1509
00:37:03,531 --> 00:37:08,000
a clever street smart person or if person
has just of average intelligence but

1510
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:09,590
very well educated,

1511
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:13,970
you would much rather go to that
person to train intellectually curious.

1512
00:37:13,971 --> 00:37:14,271
Right?

1513
00:37:14,271 --> 00:37:14,841
The guy who likes,

1514
00:37:14,841 --> 00:37:18,260
wants to find out the answer
or has access or has access.

1515
00:37:18,261 --> 00:37:18,510
Yeah.

1516
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:19,330
I mean if you either,

1517
00:37:19,330 --> 00:37:22,580
there's a lot of really smart people
that probably live in Siberia and they're

1518
00:37:22,581 --> 00:37:26,420
forced to work a trap line
catching minks and Shit,

1519
00:37:26,450 --> 00:37:27,260
you know?

1520
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:27,990
I mean,

1521
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:31,580
if you don't have data and you
don't have access to more data,

1522
00:37:31,610 --> 00:37:32,001
that's,

1523
00:37:32,001 --> 00:37:33,350
that's who you are and that's what you do,

1524
00:37:33,351 --> 00:37:33,770
right?

1525
00:37:33,770 --> 00:37:35,480
You will excel in your field,

1526
00:37:35,481 --> 00:37:36,530
but you're,

1527
00:37:36,531 --> 00:37:36,980
you know,

1528
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:40,310
your ability to actually do things will
be completely limited by the data that

1529
00:37:40,311 --> 00:37:41,130
you have access to.

1530
00:37:41,130 --> 00:37:41,360
Right,

1531
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:41,690
right,

1532
00:37:41,690 --> 00:37:42,020
right.

1533
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:42,760
It's cool

1534
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:43,370
to see how,

1535
00:37:43,370 --> 00:37:43,451
uh,

1536
00:37:43,451 --> 00:37:44,284
how,

1537
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:44,591
you know,

1538
00:37:44,591 --> 00:37:48,550
people are being given so much
more data than they used to.

1539
00:37:48,610 --> 00:37:48,791
Right.

1540
00:37:48,791 --> 00:37:52,330
It's really hard to be sort of an
ignorant person these days just because

1541
00:37:52,331 --> 00:37:53,920
there's so much information coming at us.

1542
00:37:53,950 --> 00:37:54,080
Yeah.

1543
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:56,450
It's also hard to pay
attention to everything.

1544
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:57,770
Like there's not enough,

1545
00:37:58,010 --> 00:37:59,420
I've literally find myself,

1546
00:37:59,421 --> 00:38:01,040
sometimes I come home and uh,

1547
00:38:01,041 --> 00:38:01,874
it'll be,

1548
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:05,870
my kids were all asleep and I'd just get
on the Internet at 10 and before I know

1549
00:38:05,871 --> 00:38:05,951
it,

1550
00:38:05,951 --> 00:38:09,980
it's three 30 and I'm still reading
things and watching videos and I'm like,

1551
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:10,521
shut,

1552
00:38:10,521 --> 00:38:11,570
shut this fucking thing.

1553
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:12,793
But Jesus,

1554
00:38:12,850 --> 00:38:14,320
it's like shut up high of mine.

1555
00:38:14,321 --> 00:38:14,700
Yeah.

1556
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:15,710
But I can't help it.

1557
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:20,920
And I really find myself struggling
with disconnecting from Twitter and I

1558
00:38:23,830 --> 00:38:24,670
have not mastered it,

1559
00:38:24,671 --> 00:38:27,690
but I know a guy who turns it off for he,

1560
00:38:27,691 --> 00:38:29,740
he goes to places without
Internet connection.

1561
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:32,230
He takes his laptop to places that
don't have Internet connection.

1562
00:38:33,070 --> 00:38:34,930
Maybe that'll be a new like hip thing,

1563
00:38:34,990 --> 00:38:35,171
right?

1564
00:38:35,171 --> 00:38:35,980
It would be like places that

1565
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:36,813
don't have wifi.

1566
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:37,780
Uh,

1567
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:38,080
you know,

1568
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:40,570
but you can go there with a
computer and sit without Wifi.

1569
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:41,200
And he just,

1570
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,790
and that's where he does
writing or whatever,

1571
00:38:42,791 --> 00:38:42,941
you know,

1572
00:38:42,941 --> 00:38:44,650
any actual thinking he
has to because yeah,

1573
00:38:44,830 --> 00:38:45,401
I'm like you man,

1574
00:38:45,401 --> 00:38:46,234
I get distracted.

1575
00:38:46,570 --> 00:38:47,060
Addictive.

1576
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:50,080
I do my writing that way
where I don't go online.

1577
00:38:50,081 --> 00:38:50,471
I have this,

1578
00:38:50,471 --> 00:38:50,740
uh,

1579
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:52,510
this program called right room.

1580
00:38:52,570 --> 00:38:53,080
And uh,

1581
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:58,060
what it does is it allows you to see only
the text on the screen by screen goes

1582
00:38:58,061 --> 00:39:00,220
black and it's green text on the screen.

1583
00:39:00,221 --> 00:39:01,054
And I just,

1584
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:05,110
this is the most limited word processor
is it shows you where you're spelling

1585
00:39:05,111 --> 00:39:06,190
things wrong and that's it.

1586
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:06,640
Perfect.

1587
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:10,600
And then when I want to go back and like
Google is certain things I'll have like

1588
00:39:10,601 --> 00:39:14,710
little highlights in certain areas and
I'll go back to those and then I can get

1589
00:39:14,711 --> 00:39:16,450
online and do the rest of my research.

1590
00:39:16,451 --> 00:39:18,700
But I find it's too easy to look at porn.

1591
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,313
It's too easy.

1592
00:39:20,510 --> 00:39:21,580
It's just way too easy.

1593
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,590
This is perfectly designed
to get your attention.

1594
00:39:23,610 --> 00:39:23,730
Oh,

1595
00:39:23,730 --> 00:39:24,563
it's so quick.

1596
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:25,750
And by the way,

1597
00:39:25,751 --> 00:39:27,070
with like Google chrome,

1598
00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:30,900
all you have to do is press
y and it goes to your ages.

1599
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:32,290
You know what I mean?

1600
00:39:32,290 --> 00:39:34,120
You don't even have to
do much more than that.

1601
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:35,500
That's because you go to youtube.

1602
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:38,060
I know when,

1603
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:38,261
when,

1604
00:39:38,261 --> 00:39:39,420
if I'm like looking at a,

1605
00:39:39,421 --> 00:39:39,820
um,

1606
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:40,211
something,

1607
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:41,410
I want to show my wife something.

1608
00:39:41,530 --> 00:39:44,890
I gotta press y o u t so fast.

1609
00:39:46,390 --> 00:39:50,260
I got to go through while you can't,

1610
00:39:50,261 --> 00:39:51,940
because she's a clever one.

1611
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:52,421
She,

1612
00:39:52,421 --> 00:39:54,460
she's over my shoulder
and she sees me hit that.

1613
00:39:54,461 --> 00:39:55,294
Why

1614
00:39:56,770 --> 00:40:00,320
I'm thinking about just putting it in
the fucking bookmark bar right there.

1615
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:01,360
A little youtube link.

1616
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:02,973
Just click the price.

1617
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:05,920
Just click the private
browsing thing on a safari,

1618
00:40:05,921 --> 00:40:06,641
which makes it so,

1619
00:40:06,641 --> 00:40:06,781
yeah,

1620
00:40:06,781 --> 00:40:07,850
it has no cookies or anything.

1621
00:40:08,730 --> 00:40:09,220
Sorry.

1622
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:11,620
I find so far to be
whack it in chrome too,

1623
00:40:11,621 --> 00:40:12,100
I think.

1624
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:12,420
Is that,

1625
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:13,100
yeah.

1626
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:14,200
I really enjoy chrome.

1627
00:40:14,201 --> 00:40:16,750
I love the fact that in
chrome I can go to the uh,

1628
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:17,470
the uh,

1629
00:40:17,470 --> 00:40:19,420
html to the address bar rather,

1630
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:22,990
and just type a question
and it'll take me to,

1631
00:40:22,991 --> 00:40:23,381
you know,

1632
00:40:23,381 --> 00:40:24,190
a Google search.

1633
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:24,881
That's beautiful.

1634
00:40:24,881 --> 00:40:25,360
Yeah,

1635
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:26,200
I mean that is just,

1636
00:40:26,350 --> 00:40:26,950
it's,

1637
00:40:26,950 --> 00:40:28,180
we live in awesome times.

1638
00:40:28,181 --> 00:40:29,080
It really is awesome.

1639
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:30,063
But still,

1640
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:30,550
um,

1641
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:32,320
I've described this as this,

1642
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:36,350
this time we live in now as the roaring
twenties of the digital era where you

1643
00:40:36,370 --> 00:40:39,610
could still go like this and they
know we don't have to have license,

1644
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:40,270
we don't have to,

1645
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:41,010
you know,

1646
00:40:41,010 --> 00:40:44,830
talk to government official and get a
license and it's still rare enough that

1647
00:40:44,831 --> 00:40:45,664
were popular.

1648
00:40:45,730 --> 00:40:46,090
This is,

1649
00:40:46,090 --> 00:40:47,050
this makes us,

1650
00:40:47,170 --> 00:40:47,531
you know,

1651
00:40:47,531 --> 00:40:47,771
we're,

1652
00:40:47,771 --> 00:40:48,910
we're in that we're like,

1653
00:40:49,090 --> 00:40:49,690
you know,

1654
00:40:49,690 --> 00:40:52,600
7.5% more famous than other people,

1655
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:52,840
you know,

1656
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:53,560
or whatever it someday.

1657
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:53,771
Right.

1658
00:40:53,771 --> 00:40:53,981
That,

1659
00:40:53,981 --> 00:40:54,550
that,

1660
00:40:54,550 --> 00:40:58,240
that percentage is going to drop down
because everyone's going to have access.

1661
00:40:58,410 --> 00:40:58,781
Sure.

1662
00:40:58,781 --> 00:41:03,340
And there's also a lot of people online
that were never famous before and got

1663
00:41:03,341 --> 00:41:05,080
famous because they're online content,

1664
00:41:05,081 --> 00:41:06,170
which is really amazing.

1665
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:07,630
Amazing Medians.

1666
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:08,351
I know Comedians,

1667
00:41:08,351 --> 00:41:09,310
like our friend Russell,

1668
00:41:09,311 --> 00:41:09,971
Russell Peters,

1669
00:41:09,971 --> 00:41:11,980
Russell Peters became
famous because of Youtube.

1670
00:41:11,981 --> 00:41:12,400
Is that right?

1671
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:12,671
Yeah.

1672
00:41:12,671 --> 00:41:16,780
People found his clips on Youtube and now
he sells out the o two arena in London

1673
00:41:16,930 --> 00:41:18,280
two nights in a row.

1674
00:41:18,370 --> 00:41:18,760
Wow.

1675
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,890
That's like 18,000 people.

1676
00:41:21,210 --> 00:41:23,290
The whole generation of those like,

1677
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:23,740
you know,

1678
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:24,670
out of nowhere,

1679
00:41:24,671 --> 00:41:25,930
literally out of nowhere,

1680
00:41:26,070 --> 00:41:26,770
uh,

1681
00:41:26,770 --> 00:41:27,530
success stories.

1682
00:41:27,530 --> 00:41:27,840
Yeah.

1683
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:28,571
So cool.

1684
00:41:28,571 --> 00:41:29,550
And it's so modern.

1685
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:31,730
That's totally what we like this era.

1686
00:41:31,731 --> 00:41:32,564
I made that possible.

1687
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:32,960
Yeah.

1688
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,460
I love the ability

1689
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:36,110
to distribute content,

1690
00:41:36,111 --> 00:41:41,111
the ability to distribute artwork and
podcasts and in comedy shows on Youtube or

1691
00:41:41,550 --> 00:41:42,200
what have you.

1692
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:46,130
I think it's just is the most
amazing time ever for self promotion,

1693
00:41:46,131 --> 00:41:47,150
self publishing.

1694
00:41:48,170 --> 00:41:49,120
We live in really cool time.

1695
00:41:49,190 --> 00:41:49,630
Like you say.

1696
00:41:49,630 --> 00:41:50,170
I mean,

1697
00:41:50,170 --> 00:41:51,003
like we were saying earlier,

1698
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:52,400
it's a great time to be a reader.

1699
00:41:52,401 --> 00:41:52,700
You can,

1700
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:54,380
anybody can kind of write those people,

1701
00:41:54,381 --> 00:41:54,610
you know,

1702
00:41:54,610 --> 00:41:56,330
tapping out a whole
novels on their phones.

1703
00:41:56,610 --> 00:41:57,710
There's all your stuff out there,

1704
00:41:57,740 --> 00:41:58,040
you know,

1705
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:00,590
didn't Steven Wright like
write a whole novel on Twitter?

1706
00:42:01,030 --> 00:42:01,160
Oh,

1707
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:01,610
who is that true.

1708
00:42:01,610 --> 00:42:01,751
Yeah.

1709
00:42:01,751 --> 00:42:02,700
I wrote a whole novel,

1710
00:42:02,701 --> 00:42:03,940
142

1711
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:05,261
guys.

1712
00:42:05,261 --> 00:42:05,770
Crazy.

1713
00:42:05,770 --> 00:42:06,570
Yeah.

1714
00:42:06,570 --> 00:42:06,850
Yeah.

1715
00:42:06,850 --> 00:42:07,683
Fascinating.

1716
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:08,380
Um,

1717
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:12,520
is there anything in this episode
or this issue that deals with a very

1718
00:42:12,521 --> 00:42:15,490
controversial issue of
antidepressants and they're affecting?

1719
00:42:15,490 --> 00:42:16,323
Tell him,

1720
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:18,090
I saw people asking about,

1721
00:42:18,130 --> 00:42:18,270
uh,

1722
00:42:18,270 --> 00:42:18,901
about that.

1723
00:42:18,901 --> 00:42:19,530
So,

1724
00:42:19,530 --> 00:42:19,990
you know,

1725
00:42:19,990 --> 00:42:20,823
anti psychotics,

1726
00:42:20,850 --> 00:42:22,230
here's one thing that I'll say about,

1727
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:22,610
uh,

1728
00:42:22,610 --> 00:42:24,250
or ssrs or not anti psychotics.

1729
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:24,721
Sorry,

1730
00:42:24,721 --> 00:42:25,470
not an Ssri.

1731
00:42:25,470 --> 00:42:26,130
I don't have,

1732
00:42:26,130 --> 00:42:30,190
I don't have a good informed
opinion on antidepressant.

1733
00:42:30,670 --> 00:42:31,870
I don't need a depressed,

1734
00:42:31,890 --> 00:42:33,000
I just don't know enough about it.

1735
00:42:33,001 --> 00:42:33,450
I wouldn't,

1736
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:35,640
I wouldn't know how to
comment on that intelligently.

1737
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,350
I will say that,

1738
00:42:38,070 --> 00:42:38,581
you know,

1739
00:42:38,581 --> 00:42:39,900
anti psychotics,

1740
00:42:39,930 --> 00:42:40,621
which are a sort of,

1741
00:42:40,621 --> 00:42:40,801
you know,

1742
00:42:40,801 --> 00:42:41,431
an extreme thing,

1743
00:42:41,431 --> 00:42:41,581
right?

1744
00:42:41,581 --> 00:42:42,450
There's all kinds of,

1745
00:42:42,510 --> 00:42:43,680
of uh,

1746
00:42:43,950 --> 00:42:44,251
you know,

1747
00:42:44,251 --> 00:42:46,500
incredible research being done,

1748
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:47,250
you know,

1749
00:42:47,250 --> 00:42:48,650
but we're still very,

1750
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:51,810
it's still very early days
in our understanding of
what drugs do to the brain

1751
00:42:51,811 --> 00:42:52,980
and what happens here and there.

1752
00:42:52,981 --> 00:42:53,814
And so,

1753
00:42:54,210 --> 00:42:54,650
you know,

1754
00:42:54,650 --> 00:42:55,410
anti psychotics,

1755
00:42:55,410 --> 00:42:55,740
there was,

1756
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:58,800
there was a statistically
significant group of people.

1757
00:42:59,130 --> 00:42:59,610
I think,

1758
00:42:59,610 --> 00:42:59,851
God,

1759
00:42:59,851 --> 00:43:01,200
I'm going to misrepresent this button.

1760
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:01,681
I'm busy.

1761
00:43:01,681 --> 00:43:05,490
I was talking to a university professor
who had done this study about,

1762
00:43:05,610 --> 00:43:06,443
um,

1763
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:09,140
she was a clinical psychologist who had
done a study about people taking it and

1764
00:43:09,141 --> 00:43:10,530
I psychotics and a certain number of,

1765
00:43:10,590 --> 00:43:11,410
of,

1766
00:43:11,410 --> 00:43:11,670
uh,

1767
00:43:11,670 --> 00:43:16,590
the patients were so transformed by this
new generation of anti psychotics that

1768
00:43:16,591 --> 00:43:16,980
they,

1769
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:20,940
that they voluntarily went off them to
go back to the hallucinations that they'd

1770
00:43:20,941 --> 00:43:21,774
had before.

1771
00:43:21,830 --> 00:43:22,230
Wow.

1772
00:43:22,230 --> 00:43:23,460
It's not a lot of people.

1773
00:43:23,461 --> 00:43:24,960
I don't want to miss her
represent the number,

1774
00:43:24,961 --> 00:43:27,270
but it was a statistically
significant group of people,

1775
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:30,090
which means that there are people
whose re who's for whatever reason,

1776
00:43:30,091 --> 00:43:30,960
their reaction is,

1777
00:43:30,961 --> 00:43:31,651
I would rather,

1778
00:43:31,651 --> 00:43:34,950
so in one of the cases
that you described was a,

1779
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:35,190
uh,

1780
00:43:35,190 --> 00:43:35,731
a man,

1781
00:43:35,731 --> 00:43:40,731
a homeless man who believed that he
was being pursued by the Russians,

1782
00:43:40,830 --> 00:43:41,520
you know,

1783
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:46,110
and was living in stark terror in
this kind of Cold War nightmare,

1784
00:43:46,330 --> 00:43:46,760
uh,

1785
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:47,610
every waking moment.

1786
00:43:48,090 --> 00:43:50,140
And he was homeless and so with you,

1787
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,930
but just ruined guy.

1788
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:53,670
He goes and he gets,

1789
00:43:53,671 --> 00:43:57,370
begins to get this anti
psychotic medication and these,

1790
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:00,600
and it turns off not
just your hallucinations,

1791
00:44:00,601 --> 00:44:03,660
but it also maintains your
ability to reason and function.

1792
00:44:03,661 --> 00:44:03,960
You know,

1793
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:06,630
it can be very helpful sometimes if it,

1794
00:44:06,790 --> 00:44:07,411
if it works.

1795
00:44:07,411 --> 00:44:09,120
And I'd like to point out
that's not always true.

1796
00:44:09,510 --> 00:44:10,343
Um,

1797
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:15,420
but he was so destabilized by
discovering that nobody wanted him.

1798
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:16,560
The Russians didn't want him,

1799
00:44:16,561 --> 00:44:17,281
nobody wanted him.

1800
00:44:17,281 --> 00:44:19,290
He says to the homeless guys right now,

1801
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:20,400
he's just a bum dude.

1802
00:44:20,401 --> 00:44:20,881
And he was like,

1803
00:44:20,881 --> 00:44:23,760
he was bummed out because
he wasn't special anymore.

1804
00:44:24,150 --> 00:44:26,610
He was the star of his own
action movie for so long,

1805
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:27,473
you know,

1806
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:27,991
and,

1807
00:44:27,991 --> 00:44:28,711
and more guy.

1808
00:44:28,711 --> 00:44:29,100
And He,

1809
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:31,240
and he voluntarily went back to,

1810
00:44:31,270 --> 00:44:32,103
to being,

1811
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:33,540
to living that life.

1812
00:44:33,570 --> 00:44:33,751
You know,

1813
00:44:33,751 --> 00:44:35,380
why he took the blue pill and then,

1814
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:37,110
or whatever it was and
then wished you hadn't,

1815
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:41,610
well I would like to see what he saw
before I made any sort of a judgment on

1816
00:44:41,611 --> 00:44:41,701
them.

1817
00:44:41,701 --> 00:44:42,451
Cause who knows,

1818
00:44:42,451 --> 00:44:45,350
he might have been living in an awesome
world like a Winnie the Pooh ride at

1819
00:44:45,351 --> 00:44:46,020
Disney land.

1820
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:46,580
Totally.

1821
00:44:46,580 --> 00:44:46,861
You know,

1822
00:44:46,861 --> 00:44:50,790
just neon colors everywhere and fucking
Russian agents hiding behind two

1823
00:44:50,791 --> 00:44:53,640
dimensional trees driving
a Camaro convertible.

1824
00:44:54,090 --> 00:44:54,301
Yeah.

1825
00:44:54,301 --> 00:44:57,890
I mean who knows what he
actually saw antipsychotics,

1826
00:44:58,650 --> 00:45:03,530
although a fascinating subject
is quite different from the Ssri.

1827
00:45:03,531 --> 00:45:03,840
Yeah,

1828
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:04,320
absolutely.

1829
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:04,650
Um,

1830
00:45:04,650 --> 00:45:05,171
which I,

1831
00:45:05,171 --> 00:45:08,250
I think the SSRI is subject is a really,

1832
00:45:08,251 --> 00:45:09,270
really interesting one.

1833
00:45:09,290 --> 00:45:09,430
Yeah.

1834
00:45:09,430 --> 00:45:10,141
What's your feeling about it?

1835
00:45:10,141 --> 00:45:10,291
I mean,

1836
00:45:10,291 --> 00:45:11,070
do you do,

1837
00:45:11,070 --> 00:45:11,761
I don't need them,

1838
00:45:11,761 --> 00:45:16,761
so I feel like it would be really silly
of me to make a judgment in one way or

1839
00:45:18,571 --> 00:45:18,950
another.

1840
00:45:18,950 --> 00:45:19,440
Um,

1841
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:21,570
I don't have any personal
experience with them,

1842
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:25,380
but I do have friends who
have had personal experience
with them and including,

1843
00:45:25,381 --> 00:45:30,120
and people that I really respect that
they changed their life for the better.

1844
00:45:30,150 --> 00:45:30,780
That's right.

1845
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:33,720
So I definitely think there's a,

1846
00:45:33,990 --> 00:45:35,460
there's certainly a benefit to them.

1847
00:45:35,461 --> 00:45:35,990
And there's,

1848
00:45:35,990 --> 00:45:36,310
I mean,

1849
00:45:36,310 --> 00:45:37,080
I don't know.

1850
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:37,561
The other thing is,

1851
00:45:37,561 --> 00:45:38,430
which one?

1852
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:38,851
You know,

1853
00:45:38,851 --> 00:45:39,930
I have a friend and,

1854
00:45:39,931 --> 00:45:40,110
uh,

1855
00:45:40,110 --> 00:45:43,410
he got on some antidepressants and they
started him off on one and it's socks.

1856
00:45:43,411 --> 00:45:45,870
And then they switched that
and got them to another one.

1857
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:47,310
How do you feel on this?

1858
00:45:47,410 --> 00:45:47,930
You know,

1859
00:45:47,930 --> 00:45:49,440
and then they doubled his dose.

1860
00:45:49,441 --> 00:45:49,711
And I'm like,

1861
00:45:49,711 --> 00:45:50,630
what the fuck are they doing it?

1862
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:54,600
Like they don't have like dental do a
blood test and give you a very specific,

1863
00:45:54,770 --> 00:45:55,111
this one,

1864
00:45:55,111 --> 00:45:56,560
what you way back to the thing.

1865
00:45:56,700 --> 00:45:58,590
I don't know how it works in the brain,

1866
00:45:58,591 --> 00:45:58,730
right?

1867
00:45:58,730 --> 00:45:58,850
The,

1868
00:45:58,850 --> 00:46:01,530
the blood brain barrier is,

1869
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:02,010
uh,

1870
00:46:02,010 --> 00:46:02,520
this,

1871
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:02,940
you know,

1872
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:07,940
basically the body's system for keeping
things only the tiniest molecules from

1873
00:46:08,281 --> 00:46:10,890
passing into your brain because
it's such an important organ.

1874
00:46:10,891 --> 00:46:13,110
Like no one gets in VIP.

1875
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:15,380
We Boone's let's get right in.

1876
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:17,040
They do good write it and
they get in front of the line.

1877
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:18,053
So,

1878
00:46:18,110 --> 00:46:18,690
uh,

1879
00:46:18,690 --> 00:46:19,523
you know,

1880
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:20,513
the,

1881
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:22,170
the ability of,

1882
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:22,411
you know,

1883
00:46:22,411 --> 00:46:26,910
medications coming through that barrier
to change your mood or your outlook on

1884
00:46:26,911 --> 00:46:27,151
life,

1885
00:46:27,151 --> 00:46:30,000
it's such a difficult thing to predict.

1886
00:46:30,330 --> 00:46:31,163
Wow.

1887
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:32,353
Um,

1888
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:32,941
yeah.

1889
00:46:32,941 --> 00:46:33,960
And not only that,

1890
00:46:33,990 --> 00:46:36,720
it's so variable between
human beings that it's,

1891
00:46:36,721 --> 00:46:39,210
it's one person would describe you.

1892
00:46:39,390 --> 00:46:41,820
You'd almost think you're dealing
with a completely different substance,

1893
00:46:41,821 --> 00:46:43,410
one person's reaction to another.

1894
00:46:43,411 --> 00:46:44,100
Sure.

1895
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:45,300
For some folks it's mild.

1896
00:46:45,301 --> 00:46:45,961
For other folks,

1897
00:46:45,961 --> 00:46:47,790
they have horrible side effects.

1898
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:48,460
Yeah.

1899
00:46:48,460 --> 00:46:50,580
And they can't tell
until they put you on it.

1900
00:46:50,810 --> 00:46:50,970
Right.

1901
00:46:50,970 --> 00:46:51,190
It's,

1902
00:46:51,190 --> 00:46:54,390
it seems like there's so many variables
when it comes to any sort of a

1903
00:46:54,391 --> 00:46:59,340
medication that affects the mind because
you're dealing with who knows how many

1904
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:02,070
thousands of generations of genetics,

1905
00:47:02,071 --> 00:47:03,690
where your origin was like,

1906
00:47:03,930 --> 00:47:06,510
it's pretty well known
that certain people,

1907
00:47:06,511 --> 00:47:10,200
a certain nationalities have a difficult
time with alcohol because they don't

1908
00:47:10,201 --> 00:47:11,370
have a cultural history of it.

1909
00:47:11,371 --> 00:47:12,690
They don't have a genetic history of it.

1910
00:47:12,810 --> 00:47:13,021
Well,

1911
00:47:13,021 --> 00:47:13,650
the truth is,

1912
00:47:13,650 --> 00:47:15,960
human beings don't have
a history of alcohol.

1913
00:47:15,990 --> 00:47:16,320
We're not,

1914
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:17,690
we're not evolutionarily,

1915
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:18,210
you know,

1916
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:22,500
supposed to be drinking booze and
stuff is poison in terms of just the

1917
00:47:22,501 --> 00:47:23,610
toxicology of it.

1918
00:47:23,611 --> 00:47:24,300
But,

1919
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:25,920
but we evolved literally.

1920
00:47:25,921 --> 00:47:26,280
I mean there's,

1921
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:26,670
there's,

1922
00:47:26,670 --> 00:47:29,280
there's a whole field of
evolutionary biology that's studies,

1923
00:47:29,710 --> 00:47:30,190
uh,

1924
00:47:30,190 --> 00:47:34,270
the moment that we began to
drink alcohol and it was,

1925
00:47:34,271 --> 00:47:34,781
you know,

1926
00:47:34,781 --> 00:47:35,440
I don't even,

1927
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:37,240
I couldn't even guess when,

1928
00:47:37,241 --> 00:47:37,451
you know,

1929
00:47:37,451 --> 00:47:37,811
it's probably,

1930
00:47:37,811 --> 00:47:38,470
you know,

1931
00:47:38,470 --> 00:47:40,360
fifth century BC or something,

1932
00:47:40,361 --> 00:47:40,661
something,

1933
00:47:40,661 --> 00:47:40,990
you know,

1934
00:47:40,990 --> 00:47:42,340
way long time ago.

1935
00:47:42,730 --> 00:47:43,563
Um,

1936
00:47:43,870 --> 00:47:45,120
but the,

1937
00:47:45,121 --> 00:47:48,850
the idea was that there one theory is
that you would drink it in order to

1938
00:47:48,851 --> 00:47:50,650
survive eating rotten meat

1939
00:47:51,550 --> 00:47:52,630
traveler's poisoning,

1940
00:47:52,631 --> 00:47:53,350
they would call it,

1941
00:47:53,350 --> 00:47:53,621
oh,

1942
00:47:53,621 --> 00:47:55,200
is that traveler seginus yeah.

1943
00:47:55,420 --> 00:47:58,810
They would drink wine with all of their
food because the alcohol and the wine

1944
00:47:58,811 --> 00:48:00,160
they thought would kill rotten meat.

1945
00:48:00,190 --> 00:48:00,660
Totally.

1946
00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:03,520
They haven't really figured out how
to refrigerate things to Joe Rogan.

1947
00:48:03,521 --> 00:48:04,240
You want a job?

1948
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:04,391
No.

1949
00:48:04,391 --> 00:48:05,220
Thanks.

1950
00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:05,590
Um,

1951
00:48:05,590 --> 00:48:08,170
I also read a fascinating
thing about the origins of,

1952
00:48:08,171 --> 00:48:08,530
um,

1953
00:48:08,530 --> 00:48:10,990
alcohol being that it was with honey,

1954
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:11,800
Huh?

1955
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:16,150
That they had figured out a long time
ago that honey was a preferred method of

1956
00:48:16,151 --> 00:48:19,780
storing things in because it
prevented a deterioration,

1957
00:48:19,781 --> 00:48:22,320
prevented a things boiling.

1958
00:48:22,570 --> 00:48:26,080
And one of the things that happens with
honey is that it ferments and becomes

1959
00:48:26,081 --> 00:48:28,460
need and millages.

1960
00:48:28,870 --> 00:48:29,201
Yeah.

1961
00:48:29,201 --> 00:48:33,100
This was one of the theories of Terence
Mckenna on the changing of the culture

1962
00:48:33,101 --> 00:48:35,290
is from earlier psychedelic based,

1963
00:48:35,310 --> 00:48:35,620
uh,

1964
00:48:35,620 --> 00:48:36,760
mushroom cultures.

1965
00:48:37,030 --> 00:48:41,680
Two cultures that were more alcohol
based was that they started storing their

1966
00:48:41,681 --> 00:48:43,870
mushrooms in honey and uh,

1967
00:48:43,871 --> 00:48:44,110
that,

1968
00:48:44,110 --> 00:48:44,201
uh,

1969
00:48:44,201 --> 00:48:45,034
a very,

1970
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:46,020
uh,

1971
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:46,450
that's true.

1972
00:48:46,450 --> 00:48:47,283
That's so fun.

1973
00:48:47,490 --> 00:48:48,323
I don't think there's,

1974
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:53,520
I think any history older than
6,000 BC is like good luck.

1975
00:48:55,420 --> 00:48:57,280
Good luck trying to figure that out.

1976
00:48:57,281 --> 00:48:58,690
But they know that,

1977
00:48:58,720 --> 00:48:59,350
uh,

1978
00:48:59,350 --> 00:48:59,711
many,

1979
00:48:59,711 --> 00:49:03,700
many cultures where a preserving
mushrooms in various ways,

1980
00:49:03,701 --> 00:49:06,460
some of them were drawing
them out over the fireplace.

1981
00:49:06,790 --> 00:49:10,120
They were doing all these different things
with mushrooms and they know for sure

1982
00:49:10,121 --> 00:49:12,220
they started storing them in honey.

1983
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:16,180
And they also know that there
was climatological changes
where mushrooms weren't

1984
00:49:16,181 --> 00:49:19,600
growing in areas anymore and they had
a switch to different and toxicants and

1985
00:49:19,601 --> 00:49:20,710
then the raping and pillage.

1986
00:49:20,711 --> 00:49:21,544
And started,

1987
00:49:21,820 --> 00:49:22,660
shit got crazy

1988
00:49:24,310 --> 00:49:25,021
according to Mckenna,

1989
00:49:25,021 --> 00:49:26,860
at least I hadn't heard that.

1990
00:49:27,150 --> 00:49:27,850
But mead,

1991
00:49:27,850 --> 00:49:31,900
that's a lot of people don't know that
alcohol made with honey is a w an early

1992
00:49:31,901 --> 00:49:32,540
intoxicated.

1993
00:49:32,540 --> 00:49:33,291
I have to tell you though,

1994
00:49:33,291 --> 00:49:36,830
I once went to a wedding
where the only drink it was,

1995
00:49:36,860 --> 00:49:39,800
it was announced to us when we
arrived would be honey mead.

1996
00:49:39,830 --> 00:49:40,251
That the,

1997
00:49:40,251 --> 00:49:45,251
like the grooms brother or something
had made and everybody had only made and

1998
00:49:45,561 --> 00:49:45,700
uh,

1999
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:46,280
you know,

2000
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:47,600
it's not like I hold it against people,

2001
00:49:47,601 --> 00:49:48,380
but you know,

2002
00:49:48,380 --> 00:49:51,230
I would have happily paid cash
for a cock for a whiskey cocktail,

2003
00:49:51,231 --> 00:49:51,471
you know,

2004
00:49:51,471 --> 00:49:51,651
like,

2005
00:49:51,651 --> 00:49:52,450
oh my God.

2006
00:49:52,450 --> 00:49:52,821
And it does,

2007
00:49:52,821 --> 00:49:54,710
it tastes like it's a,

2008
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:55,553
it was like,

2009
00:49:56,540 --> 00:49:57,021
Oh man,

2010
00:49:57,021 --> 00:49:57,351
I don't know.

2011
00:49:57,351 --> 00:49:58,340
It's like week.

2012
00:49:58,670 --> 00:50:01,010
It's like a cross between
wine and beer almost,

2013
00:50:01,130 --> 00:50:01,960
but,

2014
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:04,340
but sort of a sour sweet,

2015
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:05,210
you know what I mean?

2016
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:05,961
It's a weird drink.

2017
00:50:05,961 --> 00:50:06,680
I didn't like it.

2018
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:07,540
I didn't like anybody.

2019
00:50:07,541 --> 00:50:07,770
Like,

2020
00:50:07,770 --> 00:50:08,031
no.

2021
00:50:08,031 --> 00:50:10,820
I would say like the whole wedding was
people dumping this stuff into beef

2022
00:50:11,310 --> 00:50:12,050
plants,

2023
00:50:12,050 --> 00:50:14,150
plants and over and over again.

2024
00:50:14,151 --> 00:50:16,350
Someone who it would be
like and raise your meats.

2025
00:50:17,900 --> 00:50:18,733
Fucking Dork.

2026
00:50:19,190 --> 00:50:20,630
They dungeons and dragons player.

2027
00:50:20,631 --> 00:50:21,061
Probably.

2028
00:50:21,061 --> 00:50:22,610
Probably people are so silly.

2029
00:50:23,290 --> 00:50:23,621
Careful.

2030
00:50:23,621 --> 00:50:24,940
This is my people only.

2031
00:50:25,730 --> 00:50:26,780
Probably my people too.

2032
00:50:26,990 --> 00:50:28,070
They're still fucking silly.

2033
00:50:28,580 --> 00:50:29,660
Not that it's bad to be silly.

2034
00:50:29,661 --> 00:50:31,100
I'm pretty sure it's a big D and d guy.

2035
00:50:31,170 --> 00:50:31,630
That was probably,

2036
00:50:31,630 --> 00:50:32,350
that was my thing.

2037
00:50:32,350 --> 00:50:33,040
Yeah.

2038
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:34,160
That was to roll the dice.

2039
00:50:35,540 --> 00:50:36,620
I should've been playing basketball,

2040
00:50:36,621 --> 00:50:38,330
but I was inside like casting spells,

2041
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:39,990
Rolling d 20 years.

2042
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:44,630
The world draws you are the universe
draws you to where it would be safest.

2043
00:50:44,660 --> 00:50:44,990
Yeah.

2044
00:50:44,990 --> 00:50:45,620
Maybe.

2045
00:50:45,620 --> 00:50:46,453
Maybe you're safer.

2046
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:47,730
Rolling dice and tricking me.

2047
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:50,240
It's a weird choice.

2048
00:50:50,780 --> 00:50:51,071
The guide,

2049
00:50:51,071 --> 00:50:51,340
dry,

2050
00:50:51,340 --> 00:50:52,490
dry makes it himself.

2051
00:50:52,491 --> 00:50:56,540
Was that what it is he was making
himself was I've never heard of that.

2052
00:50:56,541 --> 00:50:57,650
I've heard of people making wine.

2053
00:50:57,651 --> 00:50:59,270
I've never heard anybody
making their own need.

2054
00:50:59,360 --> 00:50:59,780
Yeah.

2055
00:50:59,780 --> 00:51:00,350
I don't know.

2056
00:51:00,350 --> 00:51:01,150
It was definitely a,

2057
00:51:01,150 --> 00:51:01,790
uh,

2058
00:51:01,790 --> 00:51:02,870
where I went to college.

2059
00:51:02,871 --> 00:51:06,290
There was a house of a renaissance guys.

2060
00:51:06,350 --> 00:51:06,650
Uh,

2061
00:51:06,650 --> 00:51:06,980
and,

2062
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:09,590
and one point they,

2063
00:51:10,030 --> 00:51:10,660
uh,

2064
00:51:10,660 --> 00:51:10,970
uh,

2065
00:51:10,970 --> 00:51:13,160
they would practice in
the courtyard of the dorm.

2066
00:51:13,550 --> 00:51:14,780
And when,

2067
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:15,560
uh,

2068
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:19,010
one of my friends figured
out that if you yelled,

2069
00:51:19,011 --> 00:51:19,844
hold,

2070
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:23,810
it was the super secret signal for them
to all that somebody had been hurt.

2071
00:51:23,811 --> 00:51:23,960
You know,

2072
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:24,780
somebody's been like,

2073
00:51:24,780 --> 00:51:25,110
you know,

2074
00:51:25,110 --> 00:51:28,360
poked in the eye with a nerf
sword or whatever and uh,

2075
00:51:28,530 --> 00:51:30,350
they would all go down on one knee.

2076
00:51:30,750 --> 00:51:31,170
Uh,

2077
00:51:31,170 --> 00:51:33,890
and it was like their practice
thing for like taking a time out.

2078
00:51:33,940 --> 00:51:34,640
And I was like,

2079
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:35,510
stop hurting each other.

2080
00:51:35,540 --> 00:51:36,170
And uh,

2081
00:51:36,170 --> 00:51:37,370
and so for like,

2082
00:51:37,490 --> 00:51:38,270
you know,

2083
00:51:38,270 --> 00:51:39,103
for about a week,

2084
00:51:39,110 --> 00:51:40,640
you could trick them every time.

2085
00:51:40,641 --> 00:51:41,181
You could just yell,

2086
00:51:41,181 --> 00:51:43,050
hold across the courtyard
and make all of the meal.

2087
00:51:44,150 --> 00:51:45,380
But it only lasted for a second.

2088
00:51:45,730 --> 00:51:46,730
So those are my people,

2089
00:51:46,731 --> 00:51:46,911
man.

2090
00:51:46,911 --> 00:51:47,271
I love,

2091
00:51:47,271 --> 00:51:48,080
I love it.

2092
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:48,913
The best kind.

2093
00:51:49,250 --> 00:51:54,250
Have there ever been any studies
on figuring out what it is,

2094
00:51:55,011 --> 00:51:59,750
what the process is with the people that
can't handle alcohol versus the people

2095
00:51:59,780 --> 00:52:00,311
who have a,

2096
00:52:00,311 --> 00:52:01,280
I'm sure street.

2097
00:52:01,340 --> 00:52:01,881
I'm sure.

2098
00:52:01,881 --> 00:52:02,900
I don't know what it is,

2099
00:52:02,901 --> 00:52:03,351
but yeah,

2100
00:52:03,351 --> 00:52:03,710
I mean,

2101
00:52:03,710 --> 00:52:03,981
you know,

2102
00:52:03,981 --> 00:52:04,521
it makes sense,

2103
00:52:04,521 --> 00:52:04,710
right?

2104
00:52:04,710 --> 00:52:05,060
It's just,

2105
00:52:05,060 --> 00:52:05,691
it would be like,

2106
00:52:05,691 --> 00:52:10,691
how long did people have the
gene that allows them to,

2107
00:52:10,990 --> 00:52:11,823
you know,

2108
00:52:12,050 --> 00:52:13,580
turn the liquor into sugar,

2109
00:52:13,581 --> 00:52:13,821
you know,

2110
00:52:13,821 --> 00:52:14,241
or whatever.

2111
00:52:14,241 --> 00:52:14,481
Like,

2112
00:52:14,481 --> 00:52:15,314
I dunno what the,

2113
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:16,040
what the,

2114
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:16,873
um,

2115
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:19,850
what the distinction is or
if they've discovered that or

2116
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:22,490
someone's studying for blackout drunk,

2117
00:52:23,350 --> 00:52:23,600
right.

2118
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:24,270
What is that?

2119
00:52:24,270 --> 00:52:25,130
This tolerance.

2120
00:52:25,310 --> 00:52:27,590
Your brain just says
enough when you're young.

2121
00:52:27,591 --> 00:52:31,610
One beer got you drunk getting the more
he drank it now like I could drink a

2122
00:52:31,611 --> 00:52:32,444
million beers,

2123
00:52:32,570 --> 00:52:33,500
get blacked out.

2124
00:52:33,530 --> 00:52:34,280
But it's not true.

2125
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:35,810
You can't even drink one without slurring.

2126
00:52:35,930 --> 00:52:37,910
The fuck is different than blacked out.

2127
00:52:37,940 --> 00:52:38,773
It's true.

2128
00:52:39,060 --> 00:52:40,190
I might drink jack if I,

2129
00:52:40,191 --> 00:52:41,010
if I drink jack,

2130
00:52:41,010 --> 00:52:42,740
I'll black out if I drink.

2131
00:52:42,770 --> 00:52:43,011
I mean,

2132
00:52:43,011 --> 00:52:44,810
literally if I get best five or six beers,

2133
00:52:44,811 --> 00:52:46,530
I start to be on the verge.

2134
00:52:46,550 --> 00:52:46,690
Right.

2135
00:52:46,690 --> 00:52:46,920
Yeah.

2136
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:47,450
I'm a,

2137
00:52:47,450 --> 00:52:48,283
I'm a mess.

2138
00:52:48,870 --> 00:52:51,470
Thing is fascinating to
me because some folks,

2139
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:56,440
I've seen people who are
quote unquote addicts and uh,

2140
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:57,590
they can't do anything.

2141
00:52:57,591 --> 00:52:58,311
They can't drink,

2142
00:52:58,311 --> 00:52:59,031
they can't smoke,

2143
00:52:59,031 --> 00:52:59,811
they can't do anything.

2144
00:52:59,811 --> 00:53:00,800
They'll drink coffee.

2145
00:53:00,830 --> 00:53:01,101
You know,

2146
00:53:01,101 --> 00:53:02,240
coffee apparently is okay.

2147
00:53:02,460 --> 00:53:02,840
Um,

2148
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:04,700
but if they have one drink,

2149
00:53:05,090 --> 00:53:05,511
they're gone.

2150
00:53:05,511 --> 00:53:08,720
They're off to the races and they're
doing heroin and sucking dicks for cash,

2151
00:53:08,721 --> 00:53:09,441
money to get home,

2152
00:53:09,441 --> 00:53:10,070
whatever.

2153
00:53:10,070 --> 00:53:10,660
They just,

2154
00:53:10,660 --> 00:53:10,980
they,

2155
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:12,140
they don't know what happened.

2156
00:53:12,170 --> 00:53:13,820
They don't know what it is.

2157
00:53:13,850 --> 00:53:14,810
But for me,

2158
00:53:15,110 --> 00:53:20,060
I can get fucked up and I still remember
a pieces and chunks and I get home and

2159
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:22,420
I don't really black out.

2160
00:53:22,421 --> 00:53:22,760
Huh.

2161
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:25,280
So I have a good friend
that fucking blacks,

2162
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:26,450
I mean completely

2163
00:53:26,450 --> 00:53:26,791
box.

2164
00:53:26,791 --> 00:53:27,830
So you give them two drinks.

2165
00:53:28,340 --> 00:53:31,730
Our friend Joey Diaz says is the Indian
in him because he's Mexican and Mexicans

2166
00:53:31,731 --> 00:53:33,420
were part Indian Spaniards,

2167
00:53:33,700 --> 00:53:34,520
um,

2168
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:36,680
that the Indian and I'm
kicks in and he's gone.

2169
00:53:36,950 --> 00:53:37,850
He just vanishes.

2170
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:38,601
It's no longer there.

2171
00:53:38,601 --> 00:53:39,351
You look in his eyes,

2172
00:53:39,351 --> 00:53:40,184
looks like a durable,

2173
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:42,430
durable eyes and those drugs,

2174
00:53:42,431 --> 00:53:42,651
you know,

2175
00:53:42,651 --> 00:53:43,311
you look at it durable,

2176
00:53:43,311 --> 00:53:44,720
then motherfucker doesn't
know what's going on.

2177
00:53:46,170 --> 00:53:47,050
I don't what is,

2178
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:47,990
I mean,

2179
00:53:47,990 --> 00:53:49,250
do you know what that mechanism?

2180
00:53:49,390 --> 00:53:49,961
I don't know.

2181
00:53:49,961 --> 00:53:50,201
No,

2182
00:53:50,201 --> 00:53:51,050
I don't know enough about it.

2183
00:53:52,050 --> 00:53:52,321
I mean,

2184
00:53:52,321 --> 00:53:52,990
you know,

2185
00:53:52,990 --> 00:53:53,501
like I said though,

2186
00:53:53,501 --> 00:53:54,230
the stuff is poison.

2187
00:53:54,230 --> 00:53:54,910
Eventually your brain,

2188
00:53:54,910 --> 00:53:55,930
your body is going to say,

2189
00:53:55,931 --> 00:53:56,470
okay enough,

2190
00:53:56,470 --> 00:53:56,860
good night.

2191
00:53:56,860 --> 00:53:59,380
You know it's going to paralyze your arms.

2192
00:53:59,381 --> 00:54:01,500
So they can't lift anymore of
it to your mouth or whatever.

2193
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:02,040
There's,

2194
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:02,370
um,

2195
00:54:02,370 --> 00:54:04,620
a lot of new research being done on,

2196
00:54:04,650 --> 00:54:04,980
um,

2197
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:09,390
substances that act as
a vaccine for addicts.

2198
00:54:10,590 --> 00:54:11,423
You aware of anything?

2199
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:11,941
Yeah,

2200
00:54:11,941 --> 00:54:12,271
sure.

2201
00:54:12,271 --> 00:54:12,511
I mean,

2202
00:54:12,511 --> 00:54:13,021
some of the,

2203
00:54:13,021 --> 00:54:14,040
one of the pieces that we,

2204
00:54:14,041 --> 00:54:14,874
uh,

2205
00:54:14,910 --> 00:54:17,820
are looking at here is a
thing about exactly that.

2206
00:54:17,821 --> 00:54:18,241
Basically,

2207
00:54:18,241 --> 00:54:18,541
it's a,

2208
00:54:18,541 --> 00:54:19,374
it's a,

2209
00:54:19,830 --> 00:54:23,880
it's a piece of technology
that allows you to head off,

2210
00:54:24,030 --> 00:54:24,810
um,

2211
00:54:24,810 --> 00:54:25,290
uh,

2212
00:54:25,290 --> 00:54:26,250
seizures,

2213
00:54:26,820 --> 00:54:27,450
um,

2214
00:54:27,450 --> 00:54:29,160
and lets you basically,

2215
00:54:29,220 --> 00:54:29,550
uh,

2216
00:54:29,550 --> 00:54:30,120
uh,

2217
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:32,490
not only deliver an electrical
signal into the brain,

2218
00:54:32,491 --> 00:54:36,690
but also a pro very precisely
timed a jolt of medication.

2219
00:54:37,170 --> 00:54:38,250
So you're,

2220
00:54:38,251 --> 00:54:38,611
you know,

2221
00:54:38,611 --> 00:54:39,210
your,

2222
00:54:39,210 --> 00:54:40,020
uh,

2223
00:54:40,020 --> 00:54:40,980
ability to,

2224
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:41,880
to not just,

2225
00:54:41,881 --> 00:54:42,031
you know,

2226
00:54:42,031 --> 00:54:42,480
it does,

2227
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:43,740
it affects not just your,

2228
00:54:43,741 --> 00:54:44,574
um,

2229
00:54:44,820 --> 00:54:45,653
uh,

2230
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:47,850
the function of the brain at the time,

2231
00:54:47,851 --> 00:54:49,800
but can also like guide
it a little bit basically.

2232
00:54:50,070 --> 00:54:52,080
So the way it's designed
is like this tiny little,

2233
00:54:52,100 --> 00:54:52,350
uh,

2234
00:54:52,350 --> 00:54:52,800
uh,

2235
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:55,350
you basically end up with a film,

2236
00:54:55,890 --> 00:54:57,360
a molecule thick,

2237
00:54:57,390 --> 00:54:59,040
basically film of,

2238
00:54:59,100 --> 00:54:59,880
um,

2239
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:00,600
uh,

2240
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:02,790
basically film on top of this electrode.

2241
00:55:03,060 --> 00:55:05,250
And when you hit it
with a negative charge,

2242
00:55:05,251 --> 00:55:08,040
the film releases and medication
deep inside your brain.

2243
00:55:08,370 --> 00:55:10,670
And it'll turn off seizures
and they think that they,

2244
00:55:10,671 --> 00:55:12,000
it can also do stuff with,

2245
00:55:12,380 --> 00:55:12,570
uh,

2246
00:55:12,570 --> 00:55:15,240
that it might be able to help ward
off the effects of Parkinson's.

2247
00:55:15,241 --> 00:55:15,511
Basically,

2248
00:55:15,511 --> 00:55:16,350
seizures happen,

2249
00:55:16,590 --> 00:55:17,423
you know,

2250
00:55:18,390 --> 00:55:19,080
everybody,

2251
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:19,590
every,

2252
00:55:19,590 --> 00:55:22,230
so many kinds of ailments
can cause seizures.

2253
00:55:22,231 --> 00:55:22,411
Right.

2254
00:55:22,411 --> 00:55:23,460
It's super useful.

2255
00:55:23,461 --> 00:55:24,090
So,

2256
00:55:24,090 --> 00:55:27,990
and they also think they could use it to
turn off some of the addictive impulse

2257
00:55:28,230 --> 00:55:29,310
that could detect,

2258
00:55:29,370 --> 00:55:29,920
you know,

2259
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:30,020
I,

2260
00:55:30,020 --> 00:55:31,350
I dunno how they would do this,

2261
00:55:31,351 --> 00:55:34,990
but somehow they would detect the
signal in your brain ahead of time that

2262
00:55:34,991 --> 00:55:35,400
signals,

2263
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:36,090
or maybe it's,

2264
00:55:36,090 --> 00:55:36,750
you know,

2265
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:39,300
the environmental thing of like,

2266
00:55:39,301 --> 00:55:39,511
you know,

2267
00:55:39,511 --> 00:55:40,141
he's alone.

2268
00:55:40,141 --> 00:55:41,370
He's been alone for the past two days.

2269
00:55:41,371 --> 00:55:43,920
Who knows how it could be
triggered and then boom,

2270
00:55:43,921 --> 00:55:44,870
it hits you with this thing that,

2271
00:55:44,910 --> 00:55:45,480
that,

2272
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:45,920
you know,

2273
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:46,980
jolts you up a little bit,

2274
00:55:46,981 --> 00:55:47,251
wakes,

2275
00:55:47,251 --> 00:55:47,491
you know,

2276
00:55:47,491 --> 00:55:48,260
it gets you up again.

2277
00:55:48,260 --> 00:55:50,660
Do we know the difference between the,

2278
00:55:50,690 --> 00:55:51,100
um,

2279
00:55:51,100 --> 00:55:51,250
uh,

2280
00:55:51,250 --> 00:55:55,760
a physical addiction in the mind and
the strange addictions like gambling?

2281
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:56,760
Sure.

2282
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:57,240
I mean,

2283
00:55:57,240 --> 00:55:57,601
you know,

2284
00:55:57,601 --> 00:55:59,430
it's the reward mechanism in your brain.

2285
00:55:59,431 --> 00:56:00,360
Your brain is,

2286
00:56:00,420 --> 00:56:01,260
is a,

2287
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:02,513
um,

2288
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:04,050
basically is,

2289
00:56:04,050 --> 00:56:07,050
is rewarding you at all times
for whatever it is you're doing.

2290
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:07,291
You know,

2291
00:56:07,291 --> 00:56:08,250
with a nice feeling.

2292
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:09,290
You get a little jolt of,

2293
00:56:09,330 --> 00:56:10,290
of Serotonin,

2294
00:56:10,650 --> 00:56:10,980
uh,

2295
00:56:10,980 --> 00:56:13,230
for having done the right thing.

2296
00:56:13,260 --> 00:56:13,441
You know,

2297
00:56:13,441 --> 00:56:13,990
a lot of the time,

2298
00:56:13,990 --> 00:56:17,160
but some sort of a guiding
principle of your body basically.

2299
00:56:17,430 --> 00:56:21,300
And so you get a little thrill from
things like Twitter checking Twitter,

2300
00:56:21,301 --> 00:56:21,571
right?

2301
00:56:21,571 --> 00:56:21,811
Or,

2302
00:56:21,811 --> 00:56:21,991
you know,

2303
00:56:21,991 --> 00:56:22,950
there's a whole body of,

2304
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:23,350
of,

2305
00:56:23,350 --> 00:56:23,590
uh,

2306
00:56:23,590 --> 00:56:24,820
writing that's been done about this,

2307
00:56:24,821 --> 00:56:25,230
like the,

2308
00:56:25,230 --> 00:56:28,290
the addictive nature of picking up
new information all the time and how,

2309
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:31,030
that's why we can't get
away from the Internet.

2310
00:56:31,090 --> 00:56:31,923
Uh,

2311
00:56:32,050 --> 00:56:34,240
sometimes there's no
reward and you still do it.

2312
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:34,720
Yeah.

2313
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:34,931
Well,

2314
00:56:34,931 --> 00:56:35,351
it's right.

2315
00:56:35,351 --> 00:56:36,184
It's compulsion.

2316
00:56:36,190 --> 00:56:36,731
That's the thing.

2317
00:56:36,731 --> 00:56:37,630
It becomes a tick,

2318
00:56:37,660 --> 00:56:37,841
right?

2319
00:56:37,841 --> 00:56:38,674
It's a compulsion.

2320
00:56:38,740 --> 00:56:39,640
Your brain forms,

2321
00:56:39,641 --> 00:56:40,181
pathways,

2322
00:56:40,181 --> 00:56:40,261
it,

2323
00:56:40,261 --> 00:56:40,661
it'd be,

2324
00:56:40,661 --> 00:56:41,351
it literally,

2325
00:56:41,351 --> 00:56:43,390
you physically re architect your,

2326
00:56:43,391 --> 00:56:43,571
you know,

2327
00:56:43,571 --> 00:56:45,130
rearrange the architecture of your brain,

2328
00:56:45,350 --> 00:56:45,850
uh,

2329
00:56:45,850 --> 00:56:47,260
to reward yourself deeper,

2330
00:56:47,261 --> 00:56:49,300
more and more deeply for
that addiction over time.

2331
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:49,990
Um,

2332
00:56:49,990 --> 00:56:52,060
so gambling is exactly that kind of thing.

2333
00:56:52,061 --> 00:56:52,271
It's,

2334
00:56:52,271 --> 00:56:52,691
you know,

2335
00:56:52,691 --> 00:56:53,530
what will I get,

2336
00:56:53,560 --> 00:56:53,831
you know,

2337
00:56:53,831 --> 00:56:55,300
what's the little reward?

2338
00:56:55,301 --> 00:56:55,750
I'll get,

2339
00:56:55,750 --> 00:56:55,991
you know,

2340
00:56:55,991 --> 00:56:56,800
and there's the,

2341
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:58,030
the expectation of it,

2342
00:56:58,031 --> 00:56:58,930
the temptation of it,

2343
00:56:58,931 --> 00:56:59,621
all of those things.

2344
00:56:59,621 --> 00:57:01,300
Plus then it does pay off sometimes.

2345
00:57:01,330 --> 00:57:02,163
You know,

2346
00:57:02,230 --> 00:57:02,981
it's a crazy,

2347
00:57:02,981 --> 00:57:03,221
uh,

2348
00:57:03,221 --> 00:57:05,770
it's just your brain is an elastic thing.

2349
00:57:05,771 --> 00:57:10,771
It's if it's changing and adapting
to keep you alive and you know,

2350
00:57:10,931 --> 00:57:11,240
doing,

2351
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:13,090
you're doing the best you can,

2352
00:57:13,510 --> 00:57:13,730
uh,

2353
00:57:13,730 --> 00:57:14,650
no matter the circumstances.

2354
00:57:14,651 --> 00:57:15,460
So,

2355
00:57:15,460 --> 00:57:15,701
you know,

2356
00:57:15,701 --> 00:57:16,540
if you expose,

2357
00:57:16,541 --> 00:57:18,250
if you're exposed to an
addictive thing enough,

2358
00:57:18,251 --> 00:57:20,050
it's just going to adapt to that thing.

2359
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:22,900
Are you aware of the correlation that
studies have done about correlation

2360
00:57:22,901 --> 00:57:25,800
between brain damage
and addictive behaviors?

2361
00:57:25,850 --> 00:57:26,450
Gambling?

2362
00:57:26,450 --> 00:57:27,283
No.

2363
00:57:28,010 --> 00:57:28,300
Yeah,

2364
00:57:28,300 --> 00:57:29,980
we had a friend in here
used to be a boxer,

2365
00:57:30,450 --> 00:57:30,720
uh,

2366
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:31,840
the president of UFC,

2367
00:57:31,841 --> 00:57:32,620
Dana White,

2368
00:57:32,620 --> 00:57:32,981
who,

2369
00:57:32,981 --> 00:57:33,370
uh,

2370
00:57:33,370 --> 00:57:35,140
has been hitting the head a bunch and uh,

2371
00:57:35,170 --> 00:57:37,060
he gambles like ridiculous.

2372
00:57:37,061 --> 00:57:37,894
Like he's,

2373
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:40,570
he's lost $1 million in a night and one,

2374
00:57:40,660 --> 00:57:43,210
one 6 billion in a night as he ever has.

2375
00:57:43,211 --> 00:57:45,210
He ever saw in a professional
opinion as to why that is.

2376
00:57:45,230 --> 00:57:45,580
Sure.

2377
00:57:45,580 --> 00:57:46,160
He's rich.

2378
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:47,180
Just keeps gambling cool,

2379
00:57:47,990 --> 00:57:50,440
keeps rolling and go,

2380
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:51,190
you know.

2381
00:57:51,190 --> 00:57:51,520
But,

2382
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:51,940
um,

2383
00:57:51,940 --> 00:57:56,920
he also has had a brain scan because he
was going to enter into a boxing match

2384
00:57:56,921 --> 00:57:58,180
about six years ago.

2385
00:57:58,480 --> 00:57:59,650
And when that happened,

2386
00:57:59,651 --> 00:58:01,000
they found spots on his brain.

2387
00:58:01,030 --> 00:58:01,301
They're like,

2388
00:58:01,301 --> 00:58:01,421
yeah,

2389
00:58:01,421 --> 00:58:01,841
you've been,

2390
00:58:01,841 --> 00:58:02,411
you've been hit a lot,

2391
00:58:02,411 --> 00:58:02,620
dude.

2392
00:58:02,620 --> 00:58:03,030
Huh,

2393
00:58:03,030 --> 00:58:03,370
Huh.

2394
00:58:03,370 --> 00:58:03,790
Yeah.

2395
00:58:03,790 --> 00:58:06,850
And the fact that he's
a addicted to gambling,

2396
00:58:07,030 --> 00:58:07,481
crazy,

2397
00:58:07,481 --> 00:58:08,314
fascinating.

2398
00:58:08,410 --> 00:58:10,220
Now that the correlation
between the two of them,

2399
00:58:10,221 --> 00:58:11,650
it's like there's damage.

2400
00:58:11,650 --> 00:58:16,650
So your brain's just like constantly
urging and the impulse to seek those

2401
00:58:16,661 --> 00:58:17,290
rewards.

2402
00:58:17,290 --> 00:58:17,780
We,

2403
00:58:17,780 --> 00:58:18,590
so,

2404
00:58:18,590 --> 00:58:19,210
you know,

2405
00:58:19,210 --> 00:58:19,650
selfish,

2406
00:58:19,650 --> 00:58:21,250
let's do this to my magazine,

2407
00:58:21,251 --> 00:58:21,520
but,

2408
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:21,820
uh,

2409
00:58:21,820 --> 00:58:22,870
in this issue of the magazine,

2410
00:58:22,871 --> 00:58:23,341
we have a,

2411
00:58:23,341 --> 00:58:23,571
a,

2412
00:58:23,571 --> 00:58:24,460
a thing about,

2413
00:58:24,970 --> 00:58:25,440
um,

2414
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:25,810
uh,

2415
00:58:25,810 --> 00:58:26,050
uh,

2416
00:58:26,050 --> 00:58:26,850
basically,

2417
00:58:26,850 --> 00:58:27,340
uh,

2418
00:58:27,340 --> 00:58:27,760
you know,

2419
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:28,540
savant,

2420
00:58:28,540 --> 00:58:28,721
right?

2421
00:58:28,721 --> 00:58:30,190
The idea of being a savant right here,

2422
00:58:30,191 --> 00:58:30,461
this,

2423
00:58:30,461 --> 00:58:30,821
this,

2424
00:58:30,821 --> 00:58:31,030
uh,

2425
00:58:31,030 --> 00:58:31,621
for anyone it doesn't know,

2426
00:58:31,621 --> 00:58:31,771
you know,

2427
00:58:31,771 --> 00:58:32,010
it's the,

2428
00:58:32,010 --> 00:58:33,370
it's the idea that you're just this,

2429
00:58:33,430 --> 00:58:34,480
this perfect,

2430
00:58:34,870 --> 00:58:35,703
uh,

2431
00:58:35,930 --> 00:58:36,190
uh,

2432
00:58:36,190 --> 00:58:37,540
incredibly skillful,

2433
00:58:37,541 --> 00:58:39,070
just master of a thing,

2434
00:58:39,071 --> 00:58:39,910
whatever that thing is.

2435
00:58:40,390 --> 00:58:41,050
And,

2436
00:58:41,050 --> 00:58:41,883
um,

2437
00:58:42,190 --> 00:58:43,930
there's a B,

2438
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:44,811
basically the,

2439
00:58:44,811 --> 00:58:45,621
it's the story of the,

2440
00:58:45,621 --> 00:58:46,100
of the sky.

2441
00:58:46,100 --> 00:58:47,050
Derrick Amato,

2442
00:58:47,051 --> 00:58:47,860
who was a,

2443
00:58:47,860 --> 00:58:48,520
uh,

2444
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:48,731
he was,

2445
00:58:48,731 --> 00:58:48,910
uh,

2446
00:58:48,910 --> 00:58:49,450
you know,

2447
00:58:49,450 --> 00:58:50,530
pushing 40,

2448
00:58:50,660 --> 00:58:51,400
uh,

2449
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:51,660
you know,

2450
00:58:51,660 --> 00:58:52,120
we're,

2451
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:52,460
you know,

2452
00:58:52,460 --> 00:58:53,293
normal guy,

2453
00:58:53,470 --> 00:58:53,890
uh,

2454
00:58:53,890 --> 00:58:57,730
playing football in a pool with
his friends and Sioux City,

2455
00:58:57,731 --> 00:58:58,720
South Dakota where he's from.

2456
00:58:59,380 --> 00:59:01,510
And somebody throws a pass
to him from the Jacuzzi.

2457
00:59:01,510 --> 00:59:04,090
He leaps into the pool for it and he wacks
his head really hard on the bottom of

2458
00:59:04,091 --> 00:59:05,770
the pool and you know,

2459
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:07,390
comes up and thinks that he's like broken.

2460
00:59:07,391 --> 00:59:09,190
His skull is clutching his head,

2461
00:59:09,191 --> 00:59:09,401
you know,

2462
00:59:09,401 --> 00:59:10,570
really in agony.

2463
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:11,591
It goes to the hospitals,

2464
00:59:11,591 --> 00:59:13,630
got very serious concussion and they put,

2465
00:59:13,631 --> 00:59:14,381
they send him home,

2466
00:59:14,381 --> 00:59:14,531
you know,

2467
00:59:14,531 --> 00:59:15,580
there's nothing really to be done.

2468
00:59:15,940 --> 00:59:16,301
Uh,

2469
00:59:16,301 --> 00:59:18,820
and so they sent him home and
he sleeps for like four days.

2470
00:59:18,821 --> 00:59:19,271
Basically.

2471
00:59:19,271 --> 00:59:19,871
He wakes up,

2472
00:59:19,871 --> 00:59:21,010
he goes over to his friend's house,

2473
00:59:21,020 --> 00:59:25,310
one of the friends that was with him
when he was playing football and,

2474
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:25,550
uh,

2475
00:59:25,550 --> 00:59:27,560
sits down with the guys piano
or keyboard or whatever,

2476
00:59:27,561 --> 00:59:30,620
and just begins to play the piano and
has never really played the piano before.

2477
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:31,400
Um,

2478
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:31,941
and begins,

2479
00:59:31,941 --> 00:59:32,720
there's just,

2480
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:33,110
you know,

2481
00:59:33,110 --> 00:59:35,210
can do the trials and you know,

2482
00:59:35,211 --> 00:59:36,560
he's doing all the fancy stuff.

2483
00:59:37,070 --> 00:59:37,730
And,

2484
00:59:37,730 --> 00:59:38,563
uh,

2485
00:59:38,750 --> 00:59:39,583
the,

2486
00:59:39,740 --> 00:59:42,950
he then immediately of course goes on
the Internet and it's like Jesus Christ,

2487
00:59:42,951 --> 00:59:43,760
what's going on?

2488
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:46,220
And he said it was like an
itch that he needed a scratch.

2489
00:59:46,221 --> 00:59:48,440
It was satisfying to play
in a way that he couldn't,

2490
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:49,040
you know,

2491
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:50,150
had never experienced before.

2492
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:54,430
So he looks online and discovers that
there was a whole field of study called a

2493
00:59:54,431 --> 00:59:57,470
co into what's called
acquired savant syndrome,

2494
00:59:57,770 --> 01:00:02,630
where you pick up a miraculous skill
like this from some sort of debilitating,

2495
01:00:02,660 --> 01:00:03,020
you know,

2496
01:00:03,020 --> 01:00:07,280
brain damage or whatever the
thing ends up being and that,

2497
01:00:07,340 --> 01:00:11,690
and so he was led to a researcher who
diagnosed him as having this thing.

2498
01:00:11,691 --> 01:00:14,330
There's like fewer than 30
documented cases in the world.

2499
01:00:14,750 --> 01:00:15,480
Uh,

2500
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:16,340
but it happens.

2501
01:00:16,341 --> 01:00:18,320
And I'll just tell your
listeners right now,

2502
01:00:18,350 --> 01:00:19,960
don't go whack in your
head on stuff like that.

2503
01:00:19,970 --> 01:00:22,700
It really doesn't work out most
of the time that from memory,

2504
01:00:22,910 --> 01:00:24,290
well this is what they're
trying to figure out.

2505
01:00:24,350 --> 01:00:25,370
And so there's two things.

2506
01:00:25,371 --> 01:00:26,840
There's two competing theories about it.

2507
01:00:27,110 --> 01:00:27,741
One is,

2508
01:00:27,741 --> 01:00:28,300
and neither of the,

2509
01:00:28,300 --> 01:00:29,990
it may be that one of them is wrong.

2510
01:00:29,991 --> 01:00:31,100
So let's all keep that in mind.

2511
01:00:31,310 --> 01:00:32,420
But uh,

2512
01:00:32,450 --> 01:00:36,620
one of the theories is that when
you damage a part of the brain,

2513
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:37,670
the,

2514
01:00:37,670 --> 01:00:39,280
the you,

2515
01:00:39,310 --> 01:00:44,210
you can sometimes damage a part of the
brain that had been inhibiting the other

2516
01:00:44,211 --> 01:00:44,961
half of your brain.

2517
01:00:44,961 --> 01:00:45,920
Basically the right brain,

2518
01:00:45,921 --> 01:00:46,310
you know,

2519
01:00:46,310 --> 01:00:50,270
it was inhibiting the left side
and by damaging the right side,

2520
01:00:50,350 --> 01:00:50,600
you're,

2521
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:52,280
the left brain becomes disinhibited.

2522
01:00:52,550 --> 01:00:54,230
And so one of the things that they,

2523
01:00:54,231 --> 01:00:55,610
one of the examples they use is,

2524
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:56,271
you know,

2525
01:00:56,271 --> 01:00:59,210
as we get used to stuff over
the course of our lives,

2526
01:00:59,211 --> 01:01:03,320
we begin to develop a
shorthand for it in our brain.

2527
01:01:03,321 --> 01:01:03,471
Right?

2528
01:01:03,471 --> 01:01:05,030
You don't pick out the details anymore,

2529
01:01:05,031 --> 01:01:05,870
you're picking out the,

2530
01:01:06,040 --> 01:01:08,270
the very general landscape.

2531
01:01:08,270 --> 01:01:09,680
I was just thinking about
this on the drive here,

2532
01:01:09,681 --> 01:01:09,861
right?

2533
01:01:09,861 --> 01:01:10,910
We're driving through Burbank and,

2534
01:01:11,210 --> 01:01:12,050
and you know,

2535
01:01:12,380 --> 01:01:13,850
I was looking at a truck
and thinking to myself,

2536
01:01:13,851 --> 01:01:16,670
how would I see that truck if I was
seeing it for the very first time with,

2537
01:01:16,700 --> 01:01:16,940
you know,

2538
01:01:16,940 --> 01:01:18,650
with that side of my brain disinhibited.

2539
01:01:19,070 --> 01:01:20,060
Every rivet,

2540
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:20,510
right?

2541
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:22,460
Every little reflector and the,

2542
01:01:22,520 --> 01:01:24,350
and the panels inside the reflector,

2543
01:01:24,351 --> 01:01:28,700
like just tripping on the details and
instead my brain can go truck and,

2544
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:29,160
and boom,

2545
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:30,590
I'm onto the next thing.

2546
01:01:30,620 --> 01:01:34,210
And so that kind of shorthand
they think gets maybe scrambled,

2547
01:01:34,211 --> 01:01:35,930
this disrupted in some way when the,

2548
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:39,080
when you damage a part of the brain and
suddenly you're seeing everything fresh

2549
01:01:39,081 --> 01:01:39,890
again.

2550
01:01:39,890 --> 01:01:44,890
And so there's a whole world of guys who
can do amazing new things and there's a

2551
01:01:45,111 --> 01:01:46,750
whole new world of people who do artistry,

2552
01:01:46,940 --> 01:01:47,150
uh,

2553
01:01:47,150 --> 01:01:47,900
dementia.

2554
01:01:47,900 --> 01:01:49,850
People who are old and have dementia,

2555
01:01:50,070 --> 01:01:50,780
uh,

2556
01:01:50,780 --> 01:01:53,450
develop an artistic flair
all of a sudden with the,

2557
01:01:53,510 --> 01:01:53,870
um,

2558
01:01:53,870 --> 01:01:58,870
the savant syndrome is there
like a loss correlation?

2559
01:01:59,121 --> 01:02:00,500
Like they lost this.

2560
01:02:00,710 --> 01:02:04,340
And so now all of a sudden that it
almost always comes at a terrible cost.

2561
01:02:04,341 --> 01:02:05,030
Yes.

2562
01:02:05,030 --> 01:02:05,450
You know,

2563
01:02:05,450 --> 01:02:06,350
reasoning,

2564
01:02:06,351 --> 01:02:06,591
you know,

2565
01:02:06,591 --> 01:02:07,520
something will come out of,

2566
01:02:07,521 --> 01:02:07,671
you know,

2567
01:02:07,671 --> 01:02:09,440
and you'll have people who are severely,

2568
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:10,041
uh,

2569
01:02:10,041 --> 01:02:10,430
you know,

2570
01:02:10,430 --> 01:02:10,910
some of the,

2571
01:02:10,910 --> 01:02:15,230
some of the most amazing savant stories
or people who are very developmentally

2572
01:02:15,231 --> 01:02:16,250
disabled in other ways.

2573
01:02:16,580 --> 01:02:16,780
You know,

2574
01:02:16,780 --> 01:02:20,130
somebody have an Iq of
50 for a verbal Iq of 54.

2575
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:21,593
This one kid,

2576
01:02:21,660 --> 01:02:22,170
uh,

2577
01:02:22,170 --> 01:02:26,820
could listen to a piano on TV
once and play it perfectly,

2578
01:02:26,821 --> 01:02:27,271
whatever it was,

2579
01:02:27,271 --> 01:02:28,590
Tchaikovsky and a movie,

2580
01:02:28,770 --> 01:02:30,000
and he'd sit down at the piano and play.

2581
01:02:30,360 --> 01:02:30,900
Uh,

2582
01:02:30,900 --> 01:02:31,621
and so he,

2583
01:02:31,621 --> 01:02:33,270
but he's severely
developmentally disabled.

2584
01:02:33,271 --> 01:02:34,060
This is somebody else who's,

2585
01:02:34,060 --> 01:02:34,560
who's,

2586
01:02:34,560 --> 01:02:35,880
that's not an acquired savant,

2587
01:02:35,881 --> 01:02:37,170
that doesn't make a famous savant case.

2588
01:02:37,410 --> 01:02:38,430
So in some of these cases,

2589
01:02:38,431 --> 01:02:38,671
yeah,

2590
01:02:38,671 --> 01:02:40,220
it comes at these terrible
things he's paying,

2591
01:02:40,230 --> 01:02:40,411
you know,

2592
01:02:40,411 --> 01:02:42,120
and this guy has pain,

2593
01:02:42,121 --> 01:02:43,410
has all kinds of terrible,

2594
01:02:43,411 --> 01:02:46,470
debilitating things from his head
injury but can suddenly play this,

2595
01:02:46,540 --> 01:02:47,191
this stuff,

2596
01:02:47,191 --> 01:02:47,431
you know.

2597
01:02:47,431 --> 01:02:48,264
And so,

2598
01:02:48,270 --> 01:02:49,103
uh,

2599
01:02:49,350 --> 01:02:50,460
the other theory about it is,

2600
01:02:50,461 --> 01:02:54,870
is maybe in the dying
of a part of the brain,

2601
01:02:55,110 --> 01:02:57,750
there's weird electrical activity that,

2602
01:02:57,780 --> 01:02:58,410
you know,

2603
01:02:58,410 --> 01:03:02,100
supercharges either the area
in some way or you know,

2604
01:03:02,101 --> 01:03:02,491
this again,

2605
01:03:02,491 --> 01:03:04,620
they don't know enough about the
brain to really have any idea.

2606
01:03:04,621 --> 01:03:06,330
We barely understand concussions,

2607
01:03:06,660 --> 01:03:06,901
you know,

2608
01:03:06,901 --> 01:03:07,170
I mean,

2609
01:03:07,170 --> 01:03:09,000
actually we have a pretty
good grasp on concussions,

2610
01:03:09,001 --> 01:03:11,880
but we have no experience
protecting people from them,

2611
01:03:11,940 --> 01:03:12,251
you know,

2612
01:03:12,251 --> 01:03:13,560
and all of this because the brain,

2613
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:15,570
just our understanding of it is so new.

2614
01:03:16,540 --> 01:03:21,540
What is the thought on people that
have autism and can do amazing things.

2615
01:03:21,941 --> 01:03:22,360
Like,

2616
01:03:22,360 --> 01:03:25,900
have you seen the young man that can
look out a window from a plane and draw a

2617
01:03:25,901 --> 01:03:27,100
picture of juggling?

2618
01:03:27,590 --> 01:03:28,990
He's unbelievable,

2619
01:03:28,991 --> 01:03:29,260
right?

2620
01:03:29,260 --> 01:03:29,990
Unbelievable.

2621
01:03:29,990 --> 01:03:32,500
If you've never ever seen the video folks,

2622
01:03:32,501 --> 01:03:33,370
just Google,

2623
01:03:33,380 --> 01:03:34,213
I believe his name,

2624
01:03:34,300 --> 01:03:37,170
someone on the board
posted Steven Wilshire,

2625
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:38,940
Dj crack pies.

2626
01:03:38,970 --> 01:03:40,060
Thanks for putting that up there buddy.

2627
01:03:40,420 --> 01:03:40,900
Um,

2628
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:41,111
yeah,

2629
01:03:41,111 --> 01:03:41,351
that's,

2630
01:03:41,351 --> 01:03:42,160
that's his name.

2631
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:42,640
Um,

2632
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:43,473
the,

2633
01:03:43,900 --> 01:03:44,410
the,

2634
01:03:44,410 --> 01:03:44,831
uh,

2635
01:03:44,831 --> 01:03:49,831
ability to do things that a normal person
would literally never be able to do

2636
01:03:50,470 --> 01:03:51,220
ever.

2637
01:03:51,220 --> 01:03:52,990
And this guy can do it every single time.

2638
01:03:53,020 --> 01:03:53,400
Right,

2639
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:53,790
right,

2640
01:03:53,790 --> 01:03:54,130
right.

2641
01:03:54,130 --> 01:03:59,130
It's the thought that the mind is still
evolving and advancing and one day we're

2642
01:04:00,251 --> 01:04:02,290
all going to possess
those sort of abilities.

2643
01:04:02,570 --> 01:04:03,230
I haven't,

2644
01:04:03,230 --> 01:04:06,470
I haven't seen anybody do any
research that would suggest that,

2645
01:04:06,530 --> 01:04:08,250
but I do think that there's a lot of just,

2646
01:04:08,590 --> 01:04:11,060
I just have to say that as the
editor of the science makes it,

2647
01:04:11,061 --> 01:04:11,450
I can't,

2648
01:04:11,450 --> 01:04:11,780
you know,

2649
01:04:11,780 --> 01:04:12,613
I dunno.

2650
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:14,130
Just speculate it.

2651
01:04:14,140 --> 01:04:14,231
Yeah,

2652
01:04:14,231 --> 01:04:14,480
sure.

2653
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:15,160
I like that though.

2654
01:04:15,160 --> 01:04:15,831
It sounds cool,

2655
01:04:15,831 --> 01:04:18,050
but I don't know that
that's the case anyway.

2656
01:04:18,470 --> 01:04:18,860
Uh,

2657
01:04:18,860 --> 01:04:19,490
the,

2658
01:04:19,490 --> 01:04:21,410
the feeling though is that,

2659
01:04:21,530 --> 01:04:22,180
um,

2660
01:04:22,180 --> 01:04:22,280
uh,

2661
01:04:22,280 --> 01:04:22,581
you know,

2662
01:04:22,581 --> 01:04:23,330
autism,

2663
01:04:23,330 --> 01:04:25,970
autism is a vast spectrum of symptoms.

2664
01:04:26,390 --> 01:04:26,751
Uh,

2665
01:04:26,751 --> 01:04:27,470
you know,

2666
01:04:27,470 --> 01:04:32,130
it's not at all common for someone who's
autistic to also have these savant like

2667
01:04:32,131 --> 01:04:32,511
abilities.

2668
01:04:32,511 --> 01:04:33,620
Those are really unusual things.

2669
01:04:34,070 --> 01:04:34,400
Um,

2670
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:35,270
what's crazy about the,

2671
01:04:35,271 --> 01:04:35,511
you know,

2672
01:04:35,511 --> 01:04:35,840
the,

2673
01:04:35,840 --> 01:04:36,261
the,

2674
01:04:36,261 --> 01:04:36,530
uh,

2675
01:04:36,530 --> 01:04:37,350
the,

2676
01:04:37,350 --> 01:04:41,240
the thing that I find so interesting
is these people who are aging and

2677
01:04:41,270 --> 01:04:42,200
developing,

2678
01:04:42,410 --> 01:04:43,010
uh,

2679
01:04:43,010 --> 01:04:43,380
you know,

2680
01:04:43,380 --> 01:04:43,820
pain,

2681
01:04:43,820 --> 01:04:44,750
being able to paint,

2682
01:04:44,780 --> 01:04:45,770
being able to do all this stuff.

2683
01:04:46,090 --> 01:04:46,340
Um,

2684
01:04:46,340 --> 01:04:47,300
there's an amazing,

2685
01:04:47,360 --> 01:04:47,870
uh,

2686
01:04:47,870 --> 01:04:48,703
since I,

2687
01:04:48,900 --> 01:04:50,690
I like the theory of just from a,

2688
01:04:50,810 --> 01:04:51,051
like,

2689
01:04:51,051 --> 01:04:53,720
because it's kind of Nice
to think about that there's,

2690
01:04:54,210 --> 01:04:54,500
you know,

2691
01:04:54,500 --> 01:04:58,550
as people minds are decaying certain
artistic abilities or whatever suddenly

2692
01:04:58,551 --> 01:04:59,300
begin to flourish.

2693
01:04:59,300 --> 01:05:00,111
Like it's pretty cool.

2694
01:05:00,111 --> 01:05:00,381
I don't know.

2695
01:05:00,381 --> 01:05:01,760
I find that story pretty neat.

2696
01:05:02,210 --> 01:05:02,720
Um,

2697
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:03,740
but uh,

2698
01:05:03,840 --> 01:05:04,641
like Louis Wayne,

2699
01:05:04,641 --> 01:05:05,474
you knew who he is.

2700
01:05:06,110 --> 01:05:07,510
He's that famous artists that you said,

2701
01:05:07,511 --> 01:05:10,220
I think draw for the New York
Times or something like that.

2702
01:05:10,221 --> 01:05:14,150
And then he started getting schizophrenia
or started going crazy on his older

2703
01:05:14,151 --> 01:05:16,520
age and like just his
normal drawings of cats.

2704
01:05:16,521 --> 01:05:16,761
Like,

2705
01:05:16,761 --> 01:05:17,860
here's a example.

2706
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:19,080
It's normal drunks and cat,

2707
01:05:19,090 --> 01:05:19,571
which were like,

2708
01:05:19,571 --> 01:05:19,991
really,

2709
01:05:19,991 --> 01:05:20,261
you know,

2710
01:05:20,261 --> 01:05:20,771
normal.

2711
01:05:20,771 --> 01:05:23,500
I started to getting more
and more psychedelic,

2712
01:05:23,501 --> 01:05:26,170
almost looking until
near the end of his life.

2713
01:05:26,171 --> 01:05:28,840
It was straight up like
a grateful dead tattoo.

2714
01:05:30,220 --> 01:05:30,881
I've never seen that.

2715
01:05:30,881 --> 01:05:31,714
That's really cool.

2716
01:05:32,040 --> 01:05:34,300
Right there is so complicated.

2717
01:05:34,301 --> 01:05:34,940
Yeah.

2718
01:05:34,940 --> 01:05:36,670
Is that looks like psychedelics.

2719
01:05:37,030 --> 01:05:39,820
That looks like something you would
see if you're on mushrooms or on DMT.

2720
01:05:39,821 --> 01:05:41,430
It looks like something that's right.

2721
01:05:41,470 --> 01:05:41,921
That's right.

2722
01:05:41,921 --> 01:05:43,830
It's very fractal fractal.

2723
01:05:43,831 --> 01:05:47,020
That's right in which is what you see
when you take hardcore psychedelics.

2724
01:05:47,021 --> 01:05:48,120
So who knows his mind,

2725
01:05:48,121 --> 01:05:50,110
like just slowly flooding itself.

2726
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:51,550
The other one is Henry Darger.

2727
01:05:51,551 --> 01:05:52,384
Do you know about him?

2728
01:05:52,900 --> 01:05:53,910
He's fascinating.

2729
01:05:54,040 --> 01:05:55,210
Same kind of guy like look like,

2730
01:05:55,240 --> 01:05:55,970
um,

2731
01:05:55,970 --> 01:05:56,480
uh,

2732
01:05:56,480 --> 01:05:57,820
and his art,

2733
01:05:57,850 --> 01:06:00,200
he did so much art that uh,

2734
01:06:01,210 --> 01:06:05,690
he from the history of how it was stacked
up in his apartment when he had died

2735
01:06:05,691 --> 01:06:07,060
and his landlord found all this work,

2736
01:06:07,061 --> 01:06:08,470
nobody knew that he was doing this stuff.

2737
01:06:08,570 --> 01:06:09,820
And it's incredible.

2738
01:06:10,140 --> 01:06:10,600
Uh,

2739
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:12,640
he illustrates whole novels,

2740
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:13,570
uh,

2741
01:06:13,570 --> 01:06:13,811
of,

2742
01:06:13,811 --> 01:06:15,880
of this stuff and it's all fantastical.

2743
01:06:15,881 --> 01:06:16,840
It's quite creepy too,

2744
01:06:16,860 --> 01:06:17,591
I'll tell you right now.

2745
01:06:17,591 --> 01:06:17,831
I mean,

2746
01:06:17,831 --> 01:06:18,370
you know,

2747
01:06:18,370 --> 01:06:20,170
lots of stuff about
little girls and stuff.

2748
01:06:20,171 --> 01:06:20,381
Yeah.

2749
01:06:20,381 --> 01:06:22,690
He's just absolutely
obsessed a little girls.

2750
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:24,160
But it also,

2751
01:06:24,220 --> 01:06:24,521
he,

2752
01:06:24,521 --> 01:06:25,250
he the,

2753
01:06:25,250 --> 01:06:29,410
the body of work got more and more
intense and more and more prolific at a

2754
01:06:29,411 --> 01:06:30,700
certain stage in his life.

2755
01:06:30,730 --> 01:06:33,810
And then at the end of his life had a
tapered off and he wasn't doing any it

2756
01:06:33,850 --> 01:06:34,270
anymore.

2757
01:06:34,270 --> 01:06:34,750
And there was,

2758
01:06:34,750 --> 01:06:35,321
they think that it,

2759
01:06:35,321 --> 01:06:39,520
like his schizophrenia had sort
of flamed out at a certain wow.

2760
01:06:39,550 --> 01:06:39,850
Yeah.

2761
01:06:39,850 --> 01:06:41,500
Schizophrenia wears off.

2762
01:06:41,650 --> 01:06:42,580
Well they don't know.

2763
01:06:42,581 --> 01:06:43,001
But you know,

2764
01:06:43,001 --> 01:06:43,680
over the course of,

2765
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:48,280
of as you get old the brain
changes and who knows,

2766
01:06:48,281 --> 01:06:48,780
you know,

2767
01:06:48,780 --> 01:06:49,441
somehow it,

2768
01:06:49,441 --> 01:06:49,750
it,

2769
01:06:49,750 --> 01:06:50,501
it changes.

2770
01:06:50,501 --> 01:06:51,950
So yeah,

2771
01:06:52,270 --> 01:06:53,950
it's crazy too because if you get,

2772
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:54,760
yeah,

2773
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:56,170
some of this stuff is very disturbing.

2774
01:06:56,660 --> 01:06:56,881
Uh,

2775
01:06:56,881 --> 01:06:58,090
and when you get in there,

2776
01:06:58,440 --> 01:06:58,810
uh,

2777
01:06:58,810 --> 01:06:59,231
the,

2778
01:06:59,231 --> 01:07:00,064
the,

2779
01:07:00,190 --> 01:07:01,690
the note there in the bottom,

2780
01:07:01,691 --> 01:07:02,220
I'm sure,

2781
01:07:02,220 --> 01:07:03,850
like he has all this mythology.

2782
01:07:03,851 --> 01:07:05,530
He wrote all this stuff,

2783
01:07:05,531 --> 01:07:05,980
you know,

2784
01:07:05,980 --> 01:07:06,813
he had two,

2785
01:07:07,270 --> 01:07:08,170
two races.

2786
01:07:08,171 --> 01:07:09,004
The,

2787
01:07:09,380 --> 01:07:10,450
the tattle lingo,

2788
01:07:10,451 --> 01:07:12,000
Ian's versus the such and such,

2789
01:07:12,030 --> 01:07:12,851
I can't remember what it is,

2790
01:07:12,851 --> 01:07:13,270
but they,

2791
01:07:13,270 --> 01:07:13,710
it's,

2792
01:07:13,710 --> 01:07:14,020
you know,

2793
01:07:14,020 --> 01:07:14,853
two,

2794
01:07:14,890 --> 01:07:17,680
two armies going again
going up against each other.

2795
01:07:18,940 --> 01:07:19,300
Wow.

2796
01:07:19,300 --> 01:07:19,630
Yeah.

2797
01:07:19,630 --> 01:07:20,463
Crazy stuff.

2798
01:07:20,620 --> 01:07:25,360
It's so fascinating how someone can
lose their mind and in their artwork you

2799
01:07:25,361 --> 01:07:27,260
could sort of see the,

2800
01:07:27,270 --> 01:07:27,940
the,

2801
01:07:27,940 --> 01:07:30,250
the window into their craziness,

2802
01:07:30,590 --> 01:07:31,060
right.

2803
01:07:31,060 --> 01:07:31,661
Through their,

2804
01:07:31,661 --> 01:07:31,931
their,

2805
01:07:31,931 --> 01:07:32,380
their,

2806
01:07:32,380 --> 01:07:34,210
their offerings to their total activity.

2807
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:39,240
It's manifest that the human mind is such
a strange thing in that we're the only

2808
01:07:39,941 --> 01:07:44,470
animal that we know of that's truly
aware of what the fuck is going on.

2809
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:45,160
Um,

2810
01:07:45,160 --> 01:07:49,510
and that there is also a truly aware
of its origins and development.

2811
01:07:50,120 --> 01:07:53,210
We have some sort of sketchy information
about dolphin intelligence and we,

2812
01:07:53,480 --> 01:07:53,800
we,

2813
01:07:53,800 --> 01:07:54,041
we,

2814
01:07:54,041 --> 01:07:56,830
there's a lot of speculation when it
comes to what they can and can't do,

2815
01:07:56,831 --> 01:08:00,850
but the reality of what humans can do
as opposed to like what they used to be

2816
01:08:00,851 --> 01:08:01,684
able to do,

2817
01:08:02,350 --> 01:08:02,830
you know,

2818
01:08:02,830 --> 01:08:04,570
a 50,000,

2819
01:08:04,820 --> 01:08:06,700
hundred thousand a million years ago.

2820
01:08:06,701 --> 01:08:07,091
I mean we,

2821
01:08:07,091 --> 01:08:08,110
when we go to Australia,

2822
01:08:08,111 --> 01:08:12,410
pithy kiss and we see the little pieces
of stone that they used to chip into a,

2823
01:08:12,411 --> 01:08:14,500
a slight edge to cut meat.

2824
01:08:14,770 --> 01:08:15,880
And then you look at

2825
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:17,350
a cell phone right now.

2826
01:08:17,420 --> 01:08:18,050
That's right.

2827
01:08:18,050 --> 01:08:18,381
That's right.

2828
01:08:18,381 --> 01:08:19,214
I'll tell you right now,

2829
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:20,031
there's a,

2830
01:08:20,031 --> 01:08:24,200
there's an app we made where you
can take a photo of yourself as an

2831
01:08:24,201 --> 01:08:27,140
Australopithecus or as near the end Athol,

2832
01:08:27,350 --> 01:08:27,570
uh,

2833
01:08:27,570 --> 01:08:28,880
and see what you would've looked like.

2834
01:08:28,881 --> 01:08:31,130
It literally maps the faces
of the details of your face.

2835
01:08:31,131 --> 01:08:32,090
If anyone wants to check it out.

2836
01:08:32,390 --> 01:08:32,691
Uh,

2837
01:08:32,691 --> 01:08:33,400
it's uh,

2838
01:08:33,400 --> 01:08:33,730
uh,

2839
01:08:33,730 --> 01:08:35,050
evolver is the name of it.

2840
01:08:35,060 --> 01:08:35,811
Check it out if you want to.

2841
01:08:35,811 --> 01:08:36,510
But the,

2842
01:08:36,510 --> 01:08:36,741
the,

2843
01:08:36,741 --> 01:08:38,360
and what's amazing about it is,

2844
01:08:38,750 --> 01:08:39,470
um,

2845
01:08:39,470 --> 01:08:43,850
absolutely would you say like so
much stronger neanderthal man,

2846
01:08:43,970 --> 01:08:44,780
you know,

2847
01:08:44,780 --> 01:08:49,340
so much stronger than we are right now
with totally tear apart the greatest UFC

2848
01:08:49,400 --> 01:08:53,420
fighter just because they're just so much
heavier and there's a really short for

2849
01:08:53,421 --> 01:08:53,950
battle.

2850
01:08:53,950 --> 01:08:55,160
The short feet tall,

2851
01:08:55,161 --> 01:08:55,994
200 pounds,

2852
01:08:56,190 --> 01:08:57,620
but completely different.

2853
01:08:57,621 --> 01:09:00,820
But we're getting there and like stab
a rhino in the heart with a spear,

2854
01:09:00,830 --> 01:09:01,760
a sleeping rhino.

2855
01:09:01,760 --> 01:09:02,930
That's how they would hunt.

2856
01:09:03,190 --> 01:09:05,840
You do that and then
run is like their job.

2857
01:09:05,841 --> 01:09:07,250
And so they would find,

2858
01:09:07,580 --> 01:09:08,180
uh,

2859
01:09:08,180 --> 01:09:10,310
this is one of the theories
about why they would find,

2860
01:09:10,340 --> 01:09:10,590
uh,

2861
01:09:10,590 --> 01:09:14,180
the vertebrae of buried neanderthals
would be all messed up because from

2862
01:09:14,181 --> 01:09:15,740
terrible falls,

2863
01:09:15,741 --> 01:09:16,011
you know,

2864
01:09:16,011 --> 01:09:19,400
and being trampled and
rolled by some rhino,

2865
01:09:19,401 --> 01:09:20,300
they just stabbed,

2866
01:09:20,570 --> 01:09:20,751
you know,

2867
01:09:20,751 --> 01:09:23,730
the bravest people like you know what,

2868
01:09:23,750 --> 01:09:25,610
just dumb as fuck and really strong,

2869
01:09:25,611 --> 01:09:26,540
but they're why we're here.

2870
01:09:26,541 --> 01:09:26,781
Right.

2871
01:09:26,781 --> 01:09:28,010
I mean like they hate entity.

2872
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:29,720
Totally separate from us.

2873
01:09:29,750 --> 01:09:30,351
Neanderthal.

2874
01:09:30,351 --> 01:09:30,721
I mean we,

2875
01:09:30,721 --> 01:09:32,510
we carry around some of their genetics,

2876
01:09:32,511 --> 01:09:35,420
but there's a lot of speculation as to
whether or not we interbred with them or

2877
01:09:35,421 --> 01:09:38,570
whether or not we just
have similar origins.

2878
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:39,770
They think that because they,

2879
01:09:39,771 --> 01:09:39,980
you know,

2880
01:09:39,980 --> 01:09:41,150
were around at the same time,

2881
01:09:41,151 --> 01:09:43,640
it may have happened at some point
that they had larger minds too,

2882
01:09:43,641 --> 01:09:44,810
which is even crazier.

2883
01:09:45,440 --> 01:09:46,850
They had larger brains and people,

2884
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:48,840
which probably means or I don't know,

2885
01:09:49,100 --> 01:09:50,000
probably is not the right word,

2886
01:09:50,001 --> 01:09:50,240
but,

2887
01:09:50,240 --> 01:09:52,010
but may mean that,

2888
01:09:52,011 --> 01:09:52,251
you know,

2889
01:09:52,251 --> 01:09:53,390
they had different senses.

2890
01:09:53,391 --> 01:09:53,571
Right.

2891
01:09:53,571 --> 01:09:53,830
Different,

2892
01:09:53,830 --> 01:09:55,730
other capabilities like larger eyes to,

2893
01:09:55,780 --> 01:09:56,030
yeah.

2894
01:09:56,030 --> 01:09:56,270
Right.

2895
01:09:56,270 --> 01:09:56,480
Like,

2896
01:09:56,480 --> 01:09:57,800
let me be time slows down.

2897
01:09:57,801 --> 01:09:57,951
Right.

2898
01:09:57,951 --> 01:09:59,240
For like Anderson Silva time is,

2899
01:09:59,241 --> 01:09:59,490
you know,

2900
01:09:59,490 --> 01:10:01,490
certain slowness when the
punch is coming or whatever.

2901
01:10:01,491 --> 01:10:02,060
Right.

2902
01:10:02,060 --> 01:10:03,230
And these guys,

2903
01:10:03,231 --> 01:10:03,411
right,

2904
01:10:03,411 --> 01:10:05,210
probably could see it from a mile away.

2905
01:10:05,270 --> 01:10:07,220
They can see that rhino
tusks coming around.

2906
01:10:07,221 --> 01:10:07,540
You know,

2907
01:10:07,540 --> 01:10:07,980
he probably,

2908
01:10:07,980 --> 01:10:08,071
yeah,

2909
01:10:08,071 --> 01:10:08,960
he probably had to,

2910
01:10:08,961 --> 01:10:09,790
I mean just the,

2911
01:10:09,790 --> 01:10:10,240
just be,

2912
01:10:10,240 --> 01:10:13,350
we know by their bone structure and their
w w what we know about their tendonous

2913
01:10:13,351 --> 01:10:13,690
structure.

2914
01:10:13,690 --> 01:10:15,500
They were ridiculously physically strong.

2915
01:10:16,150 --> 01:10:16,400
Two,

2916
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:17,990
three times stronger than a normal human.

2917
01:10:18,010 --> 01:10:18,470
Oh yeah.

2918
01:10:18,470 --> 01:10:19,330
Like we literally turned,

2919
01:10:19,331 --> 01:10:19,520
you know,

2920
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:22,070
could tear your arms off if
it got a good purchase on you.

2921
01:10:22,100 --> 01:10:22,371
You know,

2922
01:10:22,371 --> 01:10:22,730
like,

2923
01:10:22,730 --> 01:10:24,080
like really strong people.

2924
01:10:24,850 --> 01:10:27,600
Are you seeing this
thing recently where the,

2925
01:10:27,720 --> 01:10:30,570
these Harvard scientists are trying to
talk a woman and to giving birth to an

2926
01:10:30,650 --> 01:10:31,220
atoll?

2927
01:10:31,220 --> 01:10:31,761
Oh my God,

2928
01:10:31,761 --> 01:10:32,120
no,

2929
01:10:32,120 --> 01:10:32,740
I haven't heard of that.

2930
01:10:32,740 --> 01:10:32,910
I mean,

2931
01:10:32,910 --> 01:10:33,743
I've heard of it,

2932
01:10:33,830 --> 01:10:35,240
but I don't know anything
directly about it.

2933
01:10:35,241 --> 01:10:35,361
Yeah,

2934
01:10:35,361 --> 01:10:35,871
I've heard of it.

2935
01:10:35,871 --> 01:10:36,690
Yeah.

2936
01:10:36,690 --> 01:10:38,420
They're trying to find a,

2937
01:10:38,740 --> 01:10:40,010
a brave woman.

2938
01:10:40,011 --> 01:10:42,560
I thought you meant that they had found
one and we're trying to talk her into

2939
01:10:42,561 --> 01:10:42,760
it.

2940
01:10:42,760 --> 01:10:43,820
I'd heard about the thing,

2941
01:10:43,821 --> 01:10:44,030
but,

2942
01:10:44,030 --> 01:10:44,120
well,

2943
01:10:44,120 --> 01:10:45,020
they're trying to find one.

2944
01:10:46,040 --> 01:10:48,640
They're willing to implant the embryo of,

2945
01:10:48,950 --> 01:10:49,751
of a neanderthal.

2946
01:10:49,751 --> 01:10:53,630
I was managing the actual negotiations
with the specific woman and felt myself.

2947
01:10:54,350 --> 01:10:55,183
That'd be a tough,

2948
01:10:55,370 --> 01:10:55,910
tough day.

2949
01:10:55,910 --> 01:10:58,250
It would be tough because there's
plenty of crazy people out there.

2950
01:10:58,251 --> 01:11:00,020
I'm sure that we'd do it
just to become famous.

2951
01:11:00,021 --> 01:11:00,240
Sure.

2952
01:11:00,240 --> 01:11:02,930
They thought that could be the next
Kim Carr Dasha if you throw the reality

2953
01:11:02,931 --> 01:11:03,764
show,

2954
01:11:04,470 --> 01:11:05,420
I'll do show of that.

2955
01:11:05,690 --> 01:11:10,520
Like going around to the she she mall
or whatever with a neanderthal babies.

2956
01:11:11,960 --> 01:11:12,380
Well,

2957
01:11:12,380 --> 01:11:13,680
they're really trying to do this.

2958
01:11:14,580 --> 01:11:15,413
It would be amazing.

2959
01:11:15,450 --> 01:11:16,021
It'd be amazing.

2960
01:11:16,021 --> 01:11:16,860
I don't know that it's,

2961
01:11:16,861 --> 01:11:19,530
I think it's a great idea
to actually bring one back.

2962
01:11:19,620 --> 01:11:20,453
Terrible idea.

2963
01:11:20,460 --> 01:11:20,821
But,

2964
01:11:20,821 --> 01:11:21,560
uh,

2965
01:11:21,560 --> 01:11:23,130
that's amazing science.

2966
01:11:23,131 --> 01:11:23,670
I'm sure.

2967
01:11:23,670 --> 01:11:23,851
I mean,

2968
01:11:23,851 --> 01:11:24,960
what if we find out that,

2969
01:11:24,990 --> 01:11:25,500
you know,

2970
01:11:25,500 --> 01:11:28,680
that we had that fucking killed them
off because they were killing people,

2971
01:11:28,681 --> 01:11:28,951
you know,

2972
01:11:28,951 --> 01:11:31,530
and then they were our mortal
enemy and that they were trying,

2973
01:11:31,531 --> 01:11:33,850
can we split the proceeds on this
movie that you're writing right here?

2974
01:11:34,550 --> 01:11:35,420
It's already been rented.

2975
01:11:36,750 --> 01:11:37,570
Sounds good.

2976
01:11:37,570 --> 01:11:37,861
All right.

2977
01:11:37,861 --> 01:11:38,370
See that?

2978
01:11:38,370 --> 01:11:38,611
Well,

2979
01:11:38,611 --> 01:11:39,031
I mean,

2980
01:11:39,031 --> 01:11:42,540
we really are entering into
very unexplored territory.

2981
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:42,720
Right.

2982
01:11:42,720 --> 01:11:43,050
There's,

2983
01:11:43,050 --> 01:11:43,530
um,

2984
01:11:43,530 --> 01:11:47,760
a new frog that has been extinct for over
30 years that they'd just have created

2985
01:11:47,910 --> 01:11:48,421
in a lab.

2986
01:11:48,421 --> 01:11:49,254
The one that births,

2987
01:11:49,470 --> 01:11:50,730
it's young through its mouth.

2988
01:11:50,810 --> 01:11:51,240
It,

2989
01:11:51,240 --> 01:11:52,890
that was it's trait I guess,

2990
01:11:52,970 --> 01:11:53,760
wow.

2991
01:11:53,760 --> 01:11:57,150
Through its mouth is where it gives
birth crazy and they've created the first

2992
01:11:57,151 --> 01:12:02,151
embryo of this now extent frog the de
extinction movement as a whole thing.

2993
01:12:02,690 --> 01:12:03,720
I'm not down with that.

2994
01:12:04,020 --> 01:12:04,650
Yeah.

2995
01:12:04,650 --> 01:12:04,921
You know,

2996
01:12:04,921 --> 01:12:05,820
some of it though is,

2997
01:12:05,880 --> 01:12:06,700
is,

2998
01:12:06,700 --> 01:12:06,991
I mean,

2999
01:12:06,991 --> 01:12:07,381
I'm with you.

3000
01:12:07,381 --> 01:12:07,680
Yeah.

3001
01:12:07,680 --> 01:12:08,570
I don't want them like,

3002
01:12:08,680 --> 01:12:08,910
you know,

3003
01:12:08,910 --> 01:12:10,710
letting loose herds of 25 foot sheet,

3004
01:12:10,711 --> 01:12:10,921
you know,

3005
01:12:10,921 --> 01:12:12,710
just because that's a better meat source.

3006
01:12:13,260 --> 01:12:14,610
You don't want the,

3007
01:12:14,611 --> 01:12:14,721
uh,

3008
01:12:14,721 --> 01:12:15,080
you know,

3009
01:12:15,080 --> 01:12:17,010
you want a little government
regulation on this one,

3010
01:12:17,011 --> 01:12:17,550
I think.

3011
01:12:17,550 --> 01:12:17,911
But,

3012
01:12:17,911 --> 01:12:18,420
uh,

3013
01:12:18,420 --> 01:12:22,020
I'm not sure if the government's
wise enough regulation of some sort.

3014
01:12:22,050 --> 01:12:22,231
Yeah.

3015
01:12:22,231 --> 01:12:23,064
Whatever.

3016
01:12:23,110 --> 01:12:25,830
I'm scientific and somebody
to hold that back somehow.

3017
01:12:25,831 --> 01:12:26,370
But anyway.

3018
01:12:26,370 --> 01:12:26,970
Um,

3019
01:12:26,970 --> 01:12:27,331
but yeah,

3020
01:12:27,331 --> 01:12:27,601
it's a,

3021
01:12:27,601 --> 01:12:28,020
you know,

3022
01:12:28,020 --> 01:12:29,910
there are some things where you could,

3023
01:12:30,130 --> 01:12:31,310
where we could learn all kinds of,

3024
01:12:31,311 --> 01:12:31,890
you know,

3025
01:12:31,890 --> 01:12:36,890
it'd be amazing to know exactly what
we had in common with Xyz person.

3026
01:12:37,711 --> 01:12:38,100
I mean,

3027
01:12:38,100 --> 01:12:38,790
you know,

3028
01:12:38,790 --> 01:12:42,780
the amount of mileage that
people get out of even the most,

3029
01:12:42,990 --> 01:12:43,351
you know,

3030
01:12:43,351 --> 01:12:45,300
loose stories about like,

3031
01:12:45,660 --> 01:12:46,230
you know,

3032
01:12:46,230 --> 01:12:49,740
we may have inherited
this trait for aggression.

3033
01:12:49,740 --> 01:12:50,101
This is like,

3034
01:12:50,101 --> 01:12:50,550
uh,

3035
01:12:50,550 --> 01:12:51,000
uh,

3036
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:52,620
people love reading about that stuff.

3037
01:12:52,621 --> 01:12:52,771
You know,

3038
01:12:52,771 --> 01:12:54,690
that's a really interesting
trope for a lot of people.

3039
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:55,321
But,

3040
01:12:55,321 --> 01:12:56,070
uh,

3041
01:12:56,070 --> 01:12:59,100
to know like this
neanderthal was this way,

3042
01:12:59,101 --> 01:12:59,520
you know,

3043
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:00,180
comparison.

3044
01:13:00,180 --> 01:13:00,841
I'm just kidding here.

3045
01:13:00,841 --> 01:13:01,261
But like,

3046
01:13:01,261 --> 01:13:01,441
you know,

3047
01:13:01,441 --> 01:13:02,370
it'd be like the,

3048
01:13:02,390 --> 01:13:03,001
the way that,

3049
01:13:03,001 --> 01:13:03,211
you know,

3050
01:13:03,211 --> 01:13:07,590
an animal correlates to
its modern day incarnation,

3051
01:13:07,620 --> 01:13:07,831
right?

3052
01:13:07,831 --> 01:13:08,664
And what that,

3053
01:13:08,720 --> 01:13:10,710
that connection is what
they have in common,

3054
01:13:10,711 --> 01:13:14,760
what they don't would be
incredibly valuable science.

3055
01:13:15,420 --> 01:13:18,180
But I'm not qualified to speak to
whether or not that's a really good idea.

3056
01:13:18,300 --> 01:13:19,530
I think it probably is.

3057
01:13:19,590 --> 01:13:23,190
I really don't think that anybody can
extrapolate what happens when you start

3058
01:13:23,220 --> 01:13:25,380
making a neighborhood of neanderthals.

3059
01:13:25,830 --> 01:13:26,310
You know,

3060
01:13:26,310 --> 01:13:27,031
no one knows,

3061
01:13:27,031 --> 01:13:27,940
no one knows in the entrance.

3062
01:13:28,020 --> 01:13:28,853
And no one knows.

3063
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:29,811
And I think there's,

3064
01:13:29,811 --> 01:13:31,680
there's this issue with,

3065
01:13:31,710 --> 01:13:32,543
um,

3066
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:33,121
we're,

3067
01:13:33,121 --> 01:13:37,080
we're always going to be curious and
we're always going to want to come up with

3068
01:13:37,081 --> 01:13:37,531
the newest,

3069
01:13:37,531 --> 01:13:37,831
latest,

3070
01:13:37,831 --> 01:13:39,450
greatest thing and figure out the newest,

3071
01:13:39,451 --> 01:13:39,661
latest,

3072
01:13:39,661 --> 01:13:40,110
greatest thing.

3073
01:13:40,110 --> 01:13:40,943
But like,

3074
01:13:40,980 --> 01:13:42,630
like the creation of the atomic bomb.

3075
01:13:43,020 --> 01:13:45,200
It's almost like once
you start that process,

3076
01:13:45,320 --> 01:13:46,470
kind of have to see it.

3077
01:13:46,580 --> 01:13:47,580
You got to have to see,

3078
01:13:47,610 --> 01:13:48,443
can we make this,

3079
01:13:48,950 --> 01:13:49,471
we do this.

3080
01:13:49,471 --> 01:13:49,801
There was,

3081
01:13:49,801 --> 01:13:51,360
the famous thing from,

3082
01:13:51,390 --> 01:13:53,660
from the Manhattan project
is evidently Atlas Allah,

3083
01:13:53,661 --> 01:13:55,100
most when the explosion was happening,

3084
01:13:55,130 --> 01:13:55,330
you know,

3085
01:13:55,330 --> 01:13:56,880
when the cumulus clouds going up is when,

3086
01:13:57,620 --> 01:13:58,080
um,

3087
01:13:58,080 --> 01:13:58,913
uh,

3088
01:13:59,160 --> 01:13:59,851
pull the cat.

3089
01:13:59,851 --> 01:14:00,051
Wow.

3090
01:14:00,051 --> 01:14:00,871
I can't believe I'm going blank.

3091
01:14:00,871 --> 01:14:01,710
His name Robert,

3092
01:14:01,740 --> 01:14:02,573
somebody helped me.

3093
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:03,871
Yes.

3094
01:14:03,871 --> 01:14:04,180
Thank you.

3095
01:14:04,180 --> 01:14:04,770
Oppenheimer.

3096
01:14:04,770 --> 01:14:05,580
Uh,

3097
01:14:05,580 --> 01:14:06,413
my God,

3098
01:14:06,890 --> 01:14:07,540
Robert Oppenheimer's,

3099
01:14:07,540 --> 01:14:08,280
you know,

3100
01:14:08,280 --> 01:14:09,300
famous phrase,

3101
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:09,650
uh,

3102
01:14:09,650 --> 01:14:12,220
I have become death just for
a worlds and racked by guilt

3103
01:14:12,220 --> 01:14:13,120
and the Bhagavad Gita.

3104
01:14:13,240 --> 01:14:14,073
The BHAGAVAD Gita.

3105
01:14:14,520 --> 01:14:15,353
Yep.

3106
01:14:15,700 --> 01:14:16,630
Richard Fineman,

3107
01:14:16,750 --> 01:14:18,850
who's like 22 or something at the time,

3108
01:14:19,090 --> 01:14:19,690
uh,

3109
01:14:19,690 --> 01:14:21,880
is up in an airplane watching
for both taking notes.

3110
01:14:21,881 --> 01:14:22,601
And he remembers,

3111
01:14:22,601 --> 01:14:23,440
and he wrote this in the book.

3112
01:14:23,750 --> 01:14:24,010
Uh,

3113
01:14:24,010 --> 01:14:24,671
he remembers that.

3114
01:14:24,671 --> 01:14:25,210
He thought it was,

3115
01:14:25,210 --> 01:14:25,391
oh,

3116
01:14:25,391 --> 01:14:26,470
that's how clouds are made.

3117
01:14:26,950 --> 01:14:29,740
Like he was already onto the next thing.

3118
01:14:29,850 --> 01:14:30,683
Like you know,

3119
01:14:30,720 --> 01:14:30,890
he,

3120
01:14:30,890 --> 01:14:32,710
he wasn't thinking at all about the,

3121
01:14:32,730 --> 01:14:34,480
the moral implications of
what had happened below him.

3122
01:14:34,481 --> 01:14:34,811
He was like,

3123
01:14:34,811 --> 01:14:35,890
that's how a clown's made.

3124
01:14:35,891 --> 01:14:36,724
That's so cool.

3125
01:14:37,170 --> 01:14:37,921
He's a scientist,

3126
01:14:37,921 --> 01:14:38,401
he's a nerd.

3127
01:14:38,401 --> 01:14:38,581
You know,

3128
01:14:38,581 --> 01:14:39,440
he's thinking that these,

3129
01:14:39,630 --> 01:14:43,500
the best kind of Geek and you need
those guys who just want to find out how

3130
01:14:43,501 --> 01:14:44,334
stuff works.

3131
01:14:44,580 --> 01:14:45,030
You know,

3132
01:14:45,030 --> 01:14:47,190
that our Oppenheimer quote
is the creepiest thing ever.

3133
01:14:47,220 --> 01:14:49,080
Also because the translation is so odd,

3134
01:14:49,110 --> 01:14:50,460
I am become death.

3135
01:14:50,520 --> 01:14:52,440
I am become death destroyer of worlds.

3136
01:14:52,910 --> 01:14:53,400
Yeah.

3137
01:14:53,400 --> 01:14:54,233
I know.

3138
01:14:54,490 --> 01:14:56,970
The just not knowing,

3139
01:14:58,020 --> 01:15:01,020
not having any idea how
this is going to be used,

3140
01:15:01,200 --> 01:15:02,810
seeing it explode and going,

3141
01:15:02,811 --> 01:15:03,490
oh fuck.

3142
01:15:03,490 --> 01:15:03,790
Oh,

3143
01:15:03,790 --> 01:15:05,190
what have we done?

3144
01:15:05,191 --> 01:15:05,610
Yeah.

3145
01:15:05,610 --> 01:15:06,443
The ceiling.

3146
01:15:06,530 --> 01:15:06,721
Well,

3147
01:15:06,721 --> 01:15:10,590
can you imagine the feeling
of the shockwave going by
when they're all in that

3148
01:15:10,591 --> 01:15:11,070
bunker?

3149
01:15:11,070 --> 01:15:11,820
And you know,

3150
01:15:11,820 --> 01:15:15,690
one of the clearest examples of us really
not knowing the implications of these

3151
01:15:15,691 --> 01:15:19,050
things is watching those early government
tapes where they would send the

3152
01:15:19,051 --> 01:15:20,750
military towards the blast.

3153
01:15:20,760 --> 01:15:21,130
Right?

3154
01:15:21,130 --> 01:15:21,520
Right.

3155
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:23,220
Everyone get under your desks or no,

3156
01:15:23,221 --> 01:15:23,820
when they would,

3157
01:15:23,820 --> 01:15:28,080
when they would blow the atomic bombs
up and then they have the military run

3158
01:15:28,081 --> 01:15:29,370
towards the blast.

3159
01:15:29,371 --> 01:15:29,790
Man,

3160
01:15:29,790 --> 01:15:31,590
those guys are dead as fuck.

3161
01:15:31,980 --> 01:15:33,300
All those guys that did that,

3162
01:15:33,330 --> 01:15:33,850
right?

3163
01:15:33,850 --> 01:15:36,810
They died horrible deaths
and they didn't know.

3164
01:15:36,900 --> 01:15:37,471
They just like,

3165
01:15:37,471 --> 01:15:38,191
what's he see?

3166
01:15:38,191 --> 01:15:40,800
What happens when make the
soldiers run towards the blast?

3167
01:15:40,801 --> 01:15:41,370
Yeah.

3168
01:15:41,370 --> 01:15:41,640
I mean,

3169
01:15:41,640 --> 01:15:43,230
the videos are really,

3170
01:15:43,231 --> 01:15:44,310
really creepy.

3171
01:15:44,311 --> 01:15:44,940
These,

3172
01:15:44,940 --> 01:15:45,840
these poor guys,

3173
01:15:45,841 --> 01:15:46,320
they're in the,

3174
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:47,370
they're in a ditch.

3175
01:15:47,580 --> 01:15:48,870
They blow up the bomb.

3176
01:15:48,871 --> 01:15:50,400
Shit's flying overhead.

3177
01:15:50,401 --> 01:15:50,671
I mean,

3178
01:15:50,671 --> 01:15:51,031
the,

3179
01:15:51,031 --> 01:15:51,250
the,

3180
01:15:51,250 --> 01:15:54,900
the whiplash from that fucking
explosion must have been insane.

3181
01:15:55,610 --> 01:15:56,180
I mean,

3182
01:15:56,180 --> 01:15:56,421
the,

3183
01:15:56,421 --> 01:15:56,840
the,

3184
01:15:56,840 --> 01:15:57,470
the,

3185
01:15:57,470 --> 01:15:57,711
you know,

3186
01:15:57,711 --> 01:15:58,040
the,

3187
01:15:58,040 --> 01:16:00,570
the electromagnetic pulse
that goes through all of this,

3188
01:16:00,571 --> 01:16:00,860
this,

3189
01:16:00,860 --> 01:16:05,000
the concussive force of that is
so unbelievable and all kinds of,

3190
01:16:05,030 --> 01:16:05,840
you know,

3191
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:07,100
that you were talking about,

3192
01:16:07,101 --> 01:16:07,311
you know,

3193
01:16:07,311 --> 01:16:09,470
your friend had had
white spots on his brain.

3194
01:16:09,471 --> 01:16:09,651
You know,

3195
01:16:09,651 --> 01:16:12,620
there's so much of that kind of brain
damage or out there in the world and

3196
01:16:12,621 --> 01:16:16,130
especially people who've had their
bell rung by a big concussion.

3197
01:16:16,131 --> 01:16:17,570
Like that is a terrible injury.

3198
01:16:17,590 --> 01:16:17,900
Yeah.

3199
01:16:17,900 --> 01:16:19,090
That's a lot of things that,

3200
01:16:19,170 --> 01:16:19,910
or one of the,

3201
01:16:19,910 --> 01:16:22,910
one of the things that people are
finding out about folks that are

3202
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:27,710
recovering from traumatic brain injury
in the military now is that they could

3203
01:16:27,711 --> 01:16:30,290
save many more people than ever before.

3204
01:16:30,470 --> 01:16:35,150
But you're getting many more people
that have these brain injuries just from

3205
01:16:35,490 --> 01:16:36,323
Casa.

3206
01:16:37,360 --> 01:16:38,890
Any other physical signs of injury.

3207
01:16:38,920 --> 01:16:39,700
That's the other crazy thing.

3208
01:16:39,700 --> 01:16:40,180
They're not,

3209
01:16:40,180 --> 01:16:40,580
you know,

3210
01:16:40,580 --> 01:16:40,800
they're,

3211
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:41,200
they,

3212
01:16:41,200 --> 01:16:42,190
they walked away,

3213
01:16:42,191 --> 01:16:42,570
you know,

3214
01:16:42,570 --> 01:16:42,800
and,

3215
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:44,260
and are lucky to have done so,

3216
01:16:44,261 --> 01:16:44,501
you know,

3217
01:16:44,501 --> 01:16:46,450
that's the sort of the medical
evaluation or it used to be,

3218
01:16:46,870 --> 01:16:49,480
and now they know that
there's an invisible,

3219
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:50,310
uh,

3220
01:16:50,310 --> 01:16:51,610
effect in the brain.

3221
01:16:51,611 --> 01:16:54,160
There's a shearing force that
passes through the brain that,

3222
01:16:54,250 --> 01:16:54,960
that,

3223
01:16:54,960 --> 01:16:55,270
you know,

3224
01:16:55,270 --> 01:16:56,230
can mess things up.

3225
01:16:56,231 --> 01:16:56,770
And that's,

3226
01:16:56,770 --> 01:16:57,011
you know,

3227
01:16:57,011 --> 01:16:58,030
a lot of the,

3228
01:16:58,420 --> 01:16:59,253
uh,

3229
01:16:59,440 --> 01:17:00,280
both football,

3230
01:17:00,281 --> 01:17:01,690
concussions and these kinds of things.

3231
01:17:01,691 --> 01:17:02,410
Like there's just a,

3232
01:17:02,410 --> 01:17:02,651
you know,

3233
01:17:02,651 --> 01:17:03,280
the brain is,

3234
01:17:03,280 --> 01:17:04,113
is fragile.

3235
01:17:04,120 --> 01:17:05,470
We're learning and,

3236
01:17:05,890 --> 01:17:08,080
and that kind of concussive blast,

3237
01:17:08,081 --> 01:17:08,261
you know,

3238
01:17:08,261 --> 01:17:11,600
an IED going off by the
roadside is really a terrible,

3239
01:17:11,630 --> 01:17:11,841
you know,

3240
01:17:11,841 --> 01:17:13,130
can can ring your bell and

3241
01:17:13,230 --> 01:17:14,640
really damage your brain.

3242
01:17:14,810 --> 01:17:15,001
Yeah.

3243
01:17:15,001 --> 01:17:16,800
We're just not that fucking durable.

3244
01:17:16,980 --> 01:17:18,180
It seems like we're not really,

3245
01:17:18,181 --> 01:17:22,290
does that look at these guys watching
this blast to staring at it and then they

3246
01:17:22,291 --> 01:17:26,490
climb out of this ditch and
they run towards the explosion.

3247
01:17:26,530 --> 01:17:27,001
Jesus.

3248
01:17:27,001 --> 01:17:27,300
Wow.

3249
01:17:27,300 --> 01:17:28,350
I've never seen that footage.

3250
01:17:28,380 --> 01:17:28,621
Oh,

3251
01:17:28,621 --> 01:17:29,340
it's so,

3252
01:17:29,340 --> 01:17:30,300
so gross.

3253
01:17:30,330 --> 01:17:31,110
I wonder,

3254
01:17:31,110 --> 01:17:33,750
I wonder what the purpose was of taking,

3255
01:17:33,751 --> 01:17:35,220
I guess just seeing what happens.

3256
01:17:35,250 --> 01:17:35,760
Wow.

3257
01:17:35,760 --> 01:17:36,630
That's what it is.

3258
01:17:36,870 --> 01:17:37,950
I mean they just look at that,

3259
01:17:38,010 --> 01:17:38,670
oops,

3260
01:17:38,670 --> 01:17:40,320
I got hit in the face with nuclear waste.

3261
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:41,341
Boom.

3262
01:17:41,341 --> 01:17:42,174
I mean look at the,

3263
01:17:42,360 --> 01:17:44,010
I mean these guys are a couple of miles.

3264
01:17:44,070 --> 01:17:44,230
Yeah,

3265
01:17:44,230 --> 01:17:46,530
that's the thing is it's probably
hitting them just after the,

3266
01:17:46,540 --> 01:17:47,040
yeah.

3267
01:17:47,040 --> 01:17:48,570
And then they jump up and they look,

3268
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:49,890
let's run towards the blasts.

3269
01:17:49,891 --> 01:17:51,170
Like we're going to go get the red.

3270
01:17:51,240 --> 01:17:51,691
I wonder.

3271
01:17:51,691 --> 01:17:51,961
Yeah.

3272
01:17:51,961 --> 01:17:54,990
I wonder if it was at a time when they
actually thought they would follow up the

3273
01:17:54,991 --> 01:17:55,920
blast with,

3274
01:17:56,880 --> 01:17:57,713
you know,

3275
01:17:57,750 --> 01:17:58,420
invading right.

3276
01:17:58,420 --> 01:17:58,721
Yes.

3277
01:17:58,721 --> 01:17:59,740
That's exactly what it was.

3278
01:18:00,130 --> 01:18:02,980
These guys are walking towards
a Goddamn mushroom cloud.

3279
01:18:03,190 --> 01:18:04,270
I haven't gotten mine high,

3280
01:18:04,510 --> 01:18:05,343
Huh?

3281
01:18:05,380 --> 01:18:05,681
Yeah.

3282
01:18:05,681 --> 01:18:06,520
It's insane.

3283
01:18:06,550 --> 01:18:07,720
It's completely insane.

3284
01:18:07,721 --> 01:18:10,030
And this was just a couple of decades ago.

3285
01:18:10,420 --> 01:18:13,930
One of the things that I've brought up
on this podcast before that is one of the

3286
01:18:14,020 --> 01:18:18,340
wildest statistics is that from the
invention of the airplane to the time

3287
01:18:18,341 --> 01:18:20,650
someone dropped an atomic
bomb from an airplane,

3288
01:18:20,850 --> 01:18:22,150
it was less than 50 years.

3289
01:18:23,110 --> 01:18:23,650
Wow,

3290
01:18:23,650 --> 01:18:24,483
that's crazy.

3291
01:18:25,240 --> 01:18:25,420
I,

3292
01:18:25,420 --> 01:18:25,721
you know,

3293
01:18:25,721 --> 01:18:26,020
there's a,

3294
01:18:26,020 --> 01:18:28,990
there's this long history of,

3295
01:18:29,350 --> 01:18:30,010
uh,

3296
01:18:30,010 --> 01:18:30,400
you know,

3297
01:18:30,400 --> 01:18:30,760
when,

3298
01:18:30,760 --> 01:18:31,011
when,

3299
01:18:31,011 --> 01:18:31,180
uh,

3300
01:18:31,180 --> 01:18:32,770
the military funds,

3301
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:32,921
uh,

3302
01:18:32,921 --> 01:18:34,420
technology and goes after it,

3303
01:18:34,860 --> 01:18:35,500
you know,

3304
01:18:35,500 --> 01:18:38,230
they master it quickly,

3305
01:18:38,290 --> 01:18:38,710
you know,

3306
01:18:38,710 --> 01:18:38,981
there,

3307
01:18:38,981 --> 01:18:41,200
they bring a lot of resources
to it and they get it done.

3308
01:18:41,290 --> 01:18:42,400
You have unlimited budgets.

3309
01:18:42,450 --> 01:18:42,700
Yeah.

3310
01:18:42,700 --> 01:18:43,421
Unlimited budgets.

3311
01:18:43,421 --> 01:18:43,751
That's right.

3312
01:18:43,751 --> 01:18:44,740
Especially when it's classified.

3313
01:18:44,770 --> 01:18:46,510
It's like you can have
line items that are,

3314
01:18:46,540 --> 01:18:47,260
you know,

3315
01:18:47,260 --> 01:18:49,880
$600 million,

3316
01:18:49,900 --> 01:18:50,140
you know,

3317
01:18:50,140 --> 01:18:50,530
Belmont,

3318
01:18:50,530 --> 01:18:50,760
it'll,

3319
01:18:50,760 --> 01:18:51,131
it'll say,

3320
01:18:51,131 --> 01:18:51,964
just like,

3321
01:18:52,180 --> 01:18:52,720
you know,

3322
01:18:52,720 --> 01:18:53,800
project roundup,

3323
01:18:53,860 --> 01:18:54,131
you know,

3324
01:18:54,131 --> 01:18:54,461
and you're like,

3325
01:18:54,461 --> 01:18:54,910
what?

3326
01:18:54,910 --> 01:18:55,191
You know,

3327
01:18:55,191 --> 01:18:56,680
and then that's $600 million.

3328
01:18:56,681 --> 01:18:58,720
It would just line item
whatever they are spending.

3329
01:18:58,721 --> 01:18:58,981
And,

3330
01:18:58,981 --> 01:19:00,280
and you know,

3331
01:19:00,370 --> 01:19:04,900
I did a TV show for discovery
of the logo that was about this.

3332
01:19:04,901 --> 01:19:06,010
And like they've got,

3333
01:19:06,190 --> 01:19:07,023
uh,

3334
01:19:07,390 --> 01:19:07,990
uh,

3335
01:19:07,990 --> 01:19:08,410
you know,

3336
01:19:08,410 --> 01:19:13,410
these whole hangers set up for private
contractors out in near Edwards Air Force

3337
01:19:13,421 --> 01:19:15,610
base at area plan 42.

3338
01:19:15,730 --> 01:19:16,540
Um,

3339
01:19:16,540 --> 01:19:17,170
and,

3340
01:19:17,170 --> 01:19:17,830
uh,

3341
01:19:17,830 --> 01:19:18,760
they just build,

3342
01:19:19,640 --> 01:19:19,840
you know,

3343
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:23,890
sometimes you'll have two private
contracts like Boeing and Lockheed both

3344
01:19:23,891 --> 01:19:25,390
building the same thing,

3345
01:19:25,480 --> 01:19:28,840
not knowing that the other is also
building it and it's the military funding,

3346
01:19:28,841 --> 01:19:33,220
two competing prototypes and
then melding them or whatever,

3347
01:19:33,250 --> 01:19:34,540
see who makes the best product,

3348
01:19:34,770 --> 01:19:35,603
the best product.

3349
01:19:35,710 --> 01:19:37,480
And they both will throw
all the money out of it.

3350
01:19:37,481 --> 01:19:38,051
That kind of stuff.

3351
01:19:38,051 --> 01:19:38,561
It's crazy.

3352
01:19:38,561 --> 01:19:39,071
So the,

3353
01:19:39,071 --> 01:19:39,340
the,

3354
01:19:39,340 --> 01:19:40,210
but when the military,

3355
01:19:40,211 --> 01:19:40,451
you know,

3356
01:19:40,451 --> 01:19:41,380
throws money at a problem,

3357
01:19:41,381 --> 01:19:42,910
they tend to solve it.

3358
01:19:42,940 --> 01:19:43,400
You know,

3359
01:19:43,400 --> 01:19:46,970
I've seen this stealth fighter a
fly overhead while you were in,

3360
01:19:46,971 --> 01:19:47,804
um,

3361
01:19:48,130 --> 01:19:48,290
uh,

3362
01:19:48,290 --> 01:19:52,730
it's Palmdale hour is near the Edwards
air force base and we were out there

3363
01:19:52,731 --> 01:19:54,500
filming fear factor several times.

3364
01:19:54,980 --> 01:19:56,930
These things fly over a,

3365
01:19:56,931 --> 01:19:59,080
especially because when we
first started fear factor,

3366
01:19:59,090 --> 01:20:00,630
it was right after September 11th.

3367
01:20:00,660 --> 01:20:01,670
Fear factor was a,

3368
01:20:01,671 --> 01:20:02,391
it went on air,

3369
01:20:02,391 --> 01:20:03,650
I think 2002.

3370
01:20:04,010 --> 01:20:06,040
So we would watch these
things fly overhead.

3371
01:20:06,050 --> 01:20:06,411
It would be like,

3372
01:20:06,411 --> 01:20:07,250
Whoa,

3373
01:20:07,590 --> 01:20:08,030
yeah,

3374
01:20:08,030 --> 01:20:09,240
that's a God damn spaceship.

3375
01:20:09,270 --> 01:20:09,700
Yeah,

3376
01:20:09,700 --> 01:20:10,240
totally.

3377
01:20:10,240 --> 01:20:10,541
Totally.

3378
01:20:10,541 --> 01:20:11,200
With all the,

3379
01:20:11,200 --> 01:20:12,550
all the angles on it,

3380
01:20:12,580 --> 01:20:15,370
it only has like two or three
angles built into the whole thing.

3381
01:20:17,710 --> 01:20:18,610
How does that work?

3382
01:20:18,760 --> 01:20:20,890
Do you know literally
that like if you have a,

3383
01:20:20,891 --> 01:20:21,251
if a,

3384
01:20:21,251 --> 01:20:21,850
if a,

3385
01:20:21,850 --> 01:20:23,230
if radar hits a thing,

3386
01:20:23,650 --> 01:20:24,220
um,

3387
01:20:24,220 --> 01:20:24,611
you know,

3388
01:20:24,611 --> 01:20:25,600
it needs a certain number,

3389
01:20:25,601 --> 01:20:25,841
you know,

3390
01:20:25,841 --> 01:20:28,630
a certain amount of the radar has
to bounce back basically and the,

3391
01:20:28,720 --> 01:20:33,720
and the more that you can make the
angles of the body of the plane match,

3392
01:20:34,480 --> 01:20:34,751
right.

3393
01:20:34,751 --> 01:20:37,300
So that's why you get those
sort of like Batman kind of,

3394
01:20:37,301 --> 01:20:37,690
you know,

3395
01:20:37,690 --> 01:20:38,890
crack ular kind of,

3396
01:20:39,060 --> 01:20:39,410
uh,

3397
01:20:39,410 --> 01:20:39,860
uh,

3398
01:20:39,860 --> 01:20:40,630
uh,

3399
01:20:40,630 --> 01:20:41,201
what am I trying to say?

3400
01:20:41,201 --> 01:20:42,160
Serrated edges.

3401
01:20:42,850 --> 01:20:47,770
It's to make those angles line up
and it's because that's a lower radar

3402
01:20:47,771 --> 01:20:48,360
signature.

3403
01:20:48,360 --> 01:20:48,580
It's,

3404
01:20:48,580 --> 01:20:49,720
there's less for the,

3405
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:52,640
for radar to pick up a
disturbance basically.

3406
01:20:52,680 --> 01:20:53,513
Our sucks.

3407
01:20:53,570 --> 01:20:54,010
Yeah.

3408
01:20:54,010 --> 01:20:55,270
Well it's not really good.

3409
01:20:55,880 --> 01:20:58,590
It's awesome for 1945 when you had some,

3410
01:20:58,720 --> 01:20:59,531
that's a subject.

3411
01:20:59,531 --> 01:21:00,364
I don't know enough about it.

3412
01:21:00,440 --> 01:21:03,340
You're making me realize like that's
totally a thing I'd need to look into.

3413
01:21:03,341 --> 01:21:03,671
Where,

3414
01:21:03,671 --> 01:21:05,290
what does the state of radar right now?

3415
01:21:05,990 --> 01:21:07,240
Is there an a new upgrade?

3416
01:21:08,180 --> 01:21:09,370
I don't know enough about that.

3417
01:21:09,371 --> 01:21:10,204
That's really upsetting.

3418
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:13,210
Gigantic spaceship with what happens?

3419
01:21:13,390 --> 01:21:13,661
Well I,

3420
01:21:13,661 --> 01:21:14,290
it makes me wonder,

3421
01:21:14,290 --> 01:21:14,531
right?

3422
01:21:14,531 --> 01:21:15,020
Yeah.

3423
01:21:15,020 --> 01:21:16,750
And you don't even see it common for like,

3424
01:21:16,751 --> 01:21:18,880
or you know enough cameras
with enough cameras.

3425
01:21:18,881 --> 01:21:19,960
Do you even need radar?

3426
01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:20,530
Right.

3427
01:21:20,530 --> 01:21:21,130
It's like a,

3428
01:21:21,130 --> 01:21:22,210
I dunno all those,

3429
01:21:22,211 --> 01:21:25,060
a radar signatures of Ufo sightings.

3430
01:21:25,061 --> 01:21:27,160
Like that's one of the things
I always point to for evidence.

3431
01:21:27,161 --> 01:21:28,540
You know that he's a Rino,

3432
01:21:28,541 --> 01:21:29,410
they showed up on radar.

3433
01:21:29,680 --> 01:21:32,890
You're telling me that we can make a ship
that doesn't show up on radar and the

3434
01:21:32,891 --> 01:21:34,720
fucking aliens haven't
figured that out yet.

3435
01:21:36,010 --> 01:21:37,240
That seems so preposterous.

3436
01:21:37,241 --> 01:21:38,380
That doesn't make any sense at all.

3437
01:21:38,630 --> 01:21:38,890
Right.

3438
01:21:38,890 --> 01:21:39,820
It's like the same as they are,

3439
01:21:39,821 --> 01:21:40,780
but tests.

3440
01:21:41,050 --> 01:21:43,810
Cause last time you went to a doctor and
he stuck something up your ass and it's

3441
01:21:43,811 --> 01:21:45,640
pretty rare you have
to have an ass problem.

3442
01:21:45,880 --> 01:21:48,040
But almost every alien abduction,

3443
01:21:48,060 --> 01:21:50,050
it leads to it and an anal test.

3444
01:21:50,140 --> 01:21:50,530
Right,

3445
01:21:50,530 --> 01:21:50,831
right,

3446
01:21:50,831 --> 01:21:51,550
right.

3447
01:21:51,550 --> 01:21:51,940
Yeah.

3448
01:21:51,940 --> 01:21:53,380
Did you know radar from Mash?

3449
01:21:53,381 --> 01:21:55,750
Lost all his fingers on
his left side of his hand.

3450
01:21:56,920 --> 01:21:58,150
I don't think that's related,

3451
01:21:58,180 --> 01:21:58,511
but no,

3452
01:21:58,511 --> 01:21:59,380
I did not know that.

3453
01:22:00,310 --> 01:22:01,143
How did he do that?

3454
01:22:02,390 --> 01:22:03,880
Or actually they were just Sporn smaller.

3455
01:22:03,881 --> 01:22:04,160
Half,

3456
01:22:04,160 --> 01:22:04,900
half small.

3457
01:22:04,900 --> 01:22:05,720
Huh.

3458
01:22:05,720 --> 01:22:05,991
Oh,

3459
01:22:05,991 --> 01:22:07,040
so he didn't lose them now.

3460
01:22:07,100 --> 01:22:07,933
I'm sorry.

3461
01:22:08,030 --> 01:22:08,301
Thanks.

3462
01:22:08,301 --> 01:22:10,640
Internet powerful Internet.

3463
01:22:11,030 --> 01:22:11,630
Um,

3464
01:22:11,630 --> 01:22:12,440
the,

3465
01:22:12,440 --> 01:22:12,711
yeah.

3466
01:22:12,711 --> 01:22:13,140
So,

3467
01:22:13,140 --> 01:22:15,620
so just to get away from
that sort of technology,

3468
01:22:15,740 --> 01:22:16,041
the,

3469
01:22:16,041 --> 01:22:16,271
the,

3470
01:22:16,271 --> 01:22:17,300
the state of,

3471
01:22:17,301 --> 01:22:17,930
um,

3472
01:22:17,930 --> 01:22:18,201
uh,

3473
01:22:18,201 --> 01:22:19,170
understanding on the,

3474
01:22:19,171 --> 01:22:20,600
on the of the human mind today,

3475
01:22:20,710 --> 01:22:20,970
what,

3476
01:22:20,970 --> 01:22:25,640
what is like one of the most bizarre
things that they've discovered recently

3477
01:22:25,810 --> 01:22:26,710
about human beings,

3478
01:22:26,711 --> 01:22:27,580
about human mind?

3479
01:22:28,240 --> 01:22:28,810
Well,

3480
01:22:28,810 --> 01:22:29,643
I mean,

3481
01:22:29,980 --> 01:22:30,581
to me,

3482
01:22:30,581 --> 01:22:31,110
the,

3483
01:22:31,110 --> 01:22:31,900
the,

3484
01:22:31,900 --> 01:22:32,733
um,

3485
01:22:33,340 --> 01:22:37,460
the money that is about to be proposed
or the rumor is right that Obama is going

3486
01:22:37,461 --> 01:22:37,700
to,

3487
01:22:37,700 --> 01:22:38,420
um,

3488
01:22:38,420 --> 01:22:38,680
uh,

3489
01:22:38,680 --> 01:22:43,680
President Obama is going to put up a
$3 billion a proposal for a brain map

3490
01:22:45,310 --> 01:22:45,851
project,

3491
01:22:45,851 --> 01:22:47,740
a federally funded brain map project.

3492
01:22:48,430 --> 01:22:49,780
It's like going to Mars,

3493
01:22:49,781 --> 01:22:49,950
right?

3494
01:22:49,950 --> 01:22:52,210
It's a great national ambition.

3495
01:22:52,230 --> 01:22:53,063
And you know,

3496
01:22:53,770 --> 01:22:57,850
I am as frugal as the next person and
I understand that we're at a time of

3497
01:22:57,851 --> 01:22:58,301
austerity.

3498
01:22:58,301 --> 01:23:03,301
But I also think that these kinds of
projects can really pay off and that you

3499
01:23:03,821 --> 01:23:06,010
can get incredible of research done

3500
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:07,480
at a great value of these days.

3501
01:23:07,481 --> 01:23:08,314
And so,

3502
01:23:08,530 --> 01:23:12,280
and it would be really nice to
understand the brain better than we do.

3503
01:23:12,370 --> 01:23:12,551
Well,

3504
01:23:12,551 --> 01:23:16,270
it's ridiculous to think
that a few billion dollars
is a lot when you can sit in

3505
01:23:16,271 --> 01:23:19,570
the military budget and seem to be a
lot of people complaining about that.

3506
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:20,230
Totally.

3507
01:23:20,230 --> 01:23:21,100
Some folks are,

3508
01:23:21,101 --> 01:23:23,110
but it's not like no one's saying,

3509
01:23:23,111 --> 01:23:23,381
listen,

3510
01:23:23,381 --> 01:23:25,270
we have to stop spending
money on the military.

3511
01:23:25,430 --> 01:23:25,900
Right.

3512
01:23:25,900 --> 01:23:26,471
If you also,

3513
01:23:26,471 --> 01:23:31,471
if you look at those social and economic
payoff of a lot of the military funded

3514
01:23:32,111 --> 01:23:34,210
or government funded research projects,

3515
01:23:34,211 --> 01:23:34,900
you know,

3516
01:23:34,900 --> 01:23:35,950
the Internet has,

3517
01:23:36,040 --> 01:23:38,080
I think we can all agree
has paid off pretty well.

3518
01:23:38,290 --> 01:23:38,501
You know,

3519
01:23:38,501 --> 01:23:38,801
that's,

3520
01:23:38,801 --> 01:23:39,370
that's that,

3521
01:23:39,370 --> 01:23:41,110
that technology is working pretty good.

3522
01:23:41,111 --> 01:23:41,944
I'd say right now,

3523
01:23:42,070 --> 01:23:42,903
uh,

3524
01:23:43,270 --> 01:23:46,690
lcds were created under
a government program.

3525
01:23:46,720 --> 01:23:46,961
You know,

3526
01:23:46,961 --> 01:23:47,071
there,

3527
01:23:47,071 --> 01:23:48,090
there's all kinds of,

3528
01:23:48,091 --> 01:23:49,270
of things that make,

3529
01:23:49,440 --> 01:23:50,320
uh,

3530
01:23:50,350 --> 01:23:51,183
you know,

3531
01:23:51,880 --> 01:23:55,720
our lives possible that get off the
ground that way and the brain is such an

3532
01:23:55,721 --> 01:23:56,554
unknown.

3533
01:23:56,590 --> 01:24:00,760
You need that bridge of money
to get from here to then the,

3534
01:24:01,030 --> 01:24:03,970
when the private sector will take
over when we know some stuff,

3535
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,610
there's going to be a lot of economic
activity that comes out of this.

3536
01:24:07,150 --> 01:24:07,570
Um,

3537
01:24:07,570 --> 01:24:08,051
so to me,

3538
01:24:08,051 --> 01:24:08,310
I,

3539
01:24:08,310 --> 01:24:08,621
you know,

3540
01:24:08,621 --> 01:24:10,150
I would love to know better the,

3541
01:24:10,151 --> 01:24:13,360
basically what they want to do is we
don't know right now what neurons in the

3542
01:24:13,361 --> 01:24:14,200
brain correspond to,

3543
01:24:14,201 --> 01:24:16,270
what behavior in the body.

3544
01:24:16,330 --> 01:24:17,980
We don't know what the thing is.

3545
01:24:17,981 --> 01:24:18,191
You know,

3546
01:24:18,191 --> 01:24:19,120
what the connection is yet.

3547
01:24:19,150 --> 01:24:20,740
And they want to try to map that out.

3548
01:24:20,741 --> 01:24:21,430
I mean,

3549
01:24:21,430 --> 01:24:22,260
as best they can.

3550
01:24:22,260 --> 01:24:26,080
But what's the general consensus as
far as what created the doubling of the

3551
01:24:26,081 --> 01:24:27,250
human brain size?

3552
01:24:27,300 --> 01:24:27,700
Uh,

3553
01:24:27,700 --> 01:24:30,220
one of the things that I read about,

3554
01:24:30,221 --> 01:24:30,480
uh,

3555
01:24:30,480 --> 01:24:30,760
the,

3556
01:24:30,760 --> 01:24:33,310
the human brain's
development was that the,

3557
01:24:33,311 --> 01:24:37,060
the one of the biggest mysteries in the
entire fossil record is that doubling of

3558
01:24:37,061 --> 01:24:39,280
the human brain for a
period of 2 million years,

3559
01:24:39,370 --> 01:24:39,640
right?

3560
01:24:39,640 --> 01:24:40,210
Yep.

3561
01:24:40,210 --> 01:24:41,380
So the,

3562
01:24:41,410 --> 01:24:43,540
the sense that I have of it and I don't,

3563
01:24:43,570 --> 01:24:44,140
that's,

3564
01:24:44,140 --> 01:24:46,480
I don't know that area too well,

3565
01:24:46,481 --> 01:24:46,930
but I,

3566
01:24:46,930 --> 01:24:47,763
but the,

3567
01:24:48,550 --> 01:24:53,550
the eating of meat set off the explosion
of the brain's supposedly like eating

3568
01:24:54,041 --> 01:24:55,270
animal protein and suddenly,

3569
01:24:55,271 --> 01:24:55,631
boom,

3570
01:24:55,631 --> 01:24:56,530
we were able to,

3571
01:24:56,590 --> 01:24:59,350
to grow our huge brains bigger.

3572
01:24:59,380 --> 01:24:59,960
You know,

3573
01:24:59,960 --> 01:25:00,370
um,

3574
01:25:00,370 --> 01:25:02,560
the process is so slow evolution,

3575
01:25:02,561 --> 01:25:02,741
right.

3576
01:25:02,741 --> 01:25:04,210
Moves so slowly that like,

3577
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:05,381
and you know,

3578
01:25:05,381 --> 01:25:07,300
that that process of that time,

3579
01:25:07,330 --> 01:25:07,840
you know,

3580
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:10,210
for it to show up in the fossil record is,

3581
01:25:10,211 --> 01:25:13,300
means it happens so quickly
in evolutionary terms.

3582
01:25:14,260 --> 01:25:15,220
Meat makes sense.

3583
01:25:15,221 --> 01:25:16,600
If cougars are super smart,

3584
01:25:17,380 --> 01:25:17,651
you know,

3585
01:25:17,651 --> 01:25:17,921
why,

3586
01:25:17,921 --> 01:25:19,300
why do people get really smart?

3587
01:25:19,301 --> 01:25:22,420
And unless I guess they had to
figure out how to get that meat.

3588
01:25:22,421 --> 01:25:26,620
And since we're sort of kind of physically
weak scavenging and trying to stay

3589
01:25:26,621 --> 01:25:26,891
alive.

3590
01:25:26,891 --> 01:25:27,241
That's right.

3591
01:25:27,241 --> 01:25:27,400
Well,

3592
01:25:27,400 --> 01:25:28,233
it's all we had.

3593
01:25:28,240 --> 01:25:28,541
I mean,

3594
01:25:28,541 --> 01:25:29,620
it was so important,

3595
01:25:29,621 --> 01:25:29,861
right?

3596
01:25:29,861 --> 01:25:34,300
That that we're one of the few
mammals that has babies that are born

3597
01:25:34,301 --> 01:25:34,930
defenseless,

3598
01:25:34,930 --> 01:25:35,830
utterly defenseless.

3599
01:25:36,070 --> 01:25:40,480
And it's because the brain is
so large that the body has to,

3600
01:25:40,560 --> 01:25:41,020
uh,

3601
01:25:41,020 --> 01:25:44,710
give birth to the baby before the baby
is truly qualified to be outside of the

3602
01:25:44,711 --> 01:25:45,250
body.

3603
01:25:45,250 --> 01:25:45,431
Well,

3604
01:25:45,431 --> 01:25:48,730
it's just ridiculous that people have sex
in the same place where the baby comes

3605
01:25:48,731 --> 01:25:49,150
out,

3606
01:25:49,150 --> 01:25:52,210
this little tiny penis and a fucking
baby supposed to come out of a hole that

3607
01:25:52,211 --> 01:25:53,950
keeps that thing tied
enough to create friction.

3608
01:25:54,520 --> 01:25:57,010
The human body should be like
a clam and she'd be like,

3609
01:25:57,011 --> 01:25:57,161
yeah,

3610
01:25:57,161 --> 01:25:59,170
you cook that baby
inside you and then boom,

3611
01:25:59,440 --> 01:26:00,221
patch it out.

3612
01:26:00,221 --> 01:26:00,611
You know,

3613
01:26:00,611 --> 01:26:02,830
a nice hard clam to protect the baby.

3614
01:26:03,150 --> 01:26:04,290
Everything's out a little,

3615
01:26:05,040 --> 01:26:05,850
open it up,

3616
01:26:05,850 --> 01:26:06,151
right?

3617
01:26:06,151 --> 01:26:07,740
And then that's how the baby comes out.

3618
01:26:07,741 --> 01:26:09,600
It's like your sexual organs,

3619
01:26:10,220 --> 01:26:11,570
this dual purpose thing,

3620
01:26:11,571 --> 01:26:14,100
it's just so nutty and pee
comes out of there too.

3621
01:26:14,190 --> 01:26:14,820
Right.

3622
01:26:14,820 --> 01:26:15,361
On the other hand,

3623
01:26:15,361 --> 01:26:15,461
I,

3624
01:26:15,461 --> 01:26:15,661
I,

3625
01:26:15,661 --> 01:26:16,290
you know,

3626
01:26:16,290 --> 01:26:17,250
an engineer would say,

3627
01:26:17,251 --> 01:26:17,640
you know,

3628
01:26:17,640 --> 01:26:18,473
that's sufficient.

3629
01:26:18,510 --> 01:26:19,380
It's really efficient.

3630
01:26:19,381 --> 01:26:21,450
You want as few openings
in the body as possible.

3631
01:26:21,570 --> 01:26:23,790
That's what they said of the
model t when it came out as well.

3632
01:26:24,510 --> 01:26:25,140
I think,

3633
01:26:25,140 --> 01:26:25,490
you know,

3634
01:26:25,490 --> 01:26:27,120
one of the issues with human beings,

3635
01:26:27,480 --> 01:26:32,280
it obviously is that we are pretty much
the same as we were 50,000 years ago,

3636
01:26:32,281 --> 01:26:33,031
biologically.

3637
01:26:33,031 --> 01:26:35,400
But the world has changed dramatically.

3638
01:26:35,401 --> 01:26:35,520
Yeah,

3639
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:35,791
sure.

3640
01:26:35,791 --> 01:26:37,110
And there's so many more of us.

3641
01:26:37,170 --> 01:26:37,680
That's right.

3642
01:26:37,680 --> 01:26:38,101
Yeah,

3643
01:26:38,101 --> 01:26:38,550
that's right.

3644
01:26:38,550 --> 01:26:39,540
So many more.

3645
01:26:39,660 --> 01:26:42,820
What's the future gonna hold
for overpopulation crazy,

3646
01:26:42,821 --> 01:26:42,920
man.

3647
01:26:42,920 --> 01:26:43,140
There's,

3648
01:26:43,140 --> 01:26:44,630
there's a whole category

3649
01:26:44,740 --> 01:26:49,540
of a sort of architecture thinking
that thinks about the density of stuff.

3650
01:26:49,570 --> 01:26:49,811
You know,

3651
01:26:49,811 --> 01:26:50,920
how we'll all live.

3652
01:26:51,250 --> 01:26:51,731
And,

3653
01:26:51,731 --> 01:26:52,240
uh,

3654
01:26:52,240 --> 01:26:52,960
um,

3655
01:26:52,960 --> 01:26:55,950
one of the amazing things that,

3656
01:26:55,960 --> 01:26:56,230
you know,

3657
01:26:56,230 --> 01:26:59,320
of these sort of things with
a megalopolis as these huge,

3658
01:26:59,780 --> 01:27:00,370
uh,

3659
01:27:00,370 --> 01:27:03,070
cities of greater than 30 million people,

3660
01:27:03,310 --> 01:27:05,890
and they think that in the
next like 15 to 20 years,

3661
01:27:06,210 --> 01:27:06,700
uh,

3662
01:27:06,700 --> 01:27:08,080
we're going to have several of them,

3663
01:27:08,140 --> 01:27:08,680
you know,

3664
01:27:08,680 --> 01:27:09,250
uh,

3665
01:27:09,250 --> 01:27:09,430
uh,

3666
01:27:09,430 --> 01:27:14,430
logos Nigeria is on course to be a 30
million person city by whatever that year

3667
01:27:14,861 --> 01:27:15,550
is.

3668
01:27:15,550 --> 01:27:16,241
Unbelievable.

3669
01:27:16,241 --> 01:27:18,220
And so the patterns of life,

3670
01:27:18,250 --> 01:27:19,083
you know,

3671
01:27:19,140 --> 01:27:21,340
for when we're living in cities that huge,

3672
01:27:21,530 --> 01:27:26,200
it's also really ridiculous that we
still have cities like New York City is a

3673
01:27:26,210 --> 01:27:29,630
perfect example where
there's not a single farm.

3674
01:27:30,410 --> 01:27:31,910
There's no one's growing shit.

3675
01:27:31,940 --> 01:27:36,370
You have 8 million plus people living in
this one tiny little island and you've

3676
01:27:36,371 --> 01:27:38,210
got to get all your food
from somewhere else.

3677
01:27:38,211 --> 01:27:38,510
Yeah,

3678
01:27:38,510 --> 01:27:38,811
that's right.

3679
01:27:38,811 --> 01:27:40,310
You don't get your gas there.

3680
01:27:40,311 --> 01:27:41,190
You don't get your,

3681
01:27:41,250 --> 01:27:42,410
your food there.

3682
01:27:42,460 --> 01:27:42,920
Right.

3683
01:27:42,920 --> 01:27:43,281
I mean,

3684
01:27:43,281 --> 01:27:46,040
I think that's one of the most ridiculous
things about human beings that we

3685
01:27:46,041 --> 01:27:48,380
still rely on shipping and transportation.

3686
01:27:48,410 --> 01:27:48,860
Right.

3687
01:27:48,860 --> 01:27:50,150
It seems that we should,

3688
01:27:50,240 --> 01:27:52,670
I mean everyone says you
should source things locally.

3689
01:27:52,671 --> 01:27:55,580
It's good for your environment
and good for your community.

3690
01:27:55,820 --> 01:27:56,720
That's all well and good.

3691
01:27:56,721 --> 01:27:57,291
But it also,

3692
01:27:57,291 --> 01:27:58,610
for survival sake,

3693
01:27:58,850 --> 01:28:02,180
when you see like what happened with
Hurricane Sandy where New York City was

3694
01:28:02,181 --> 01:28:07,181
just shut down New York City and most
advanced city in the world shut down,

3695
01:28:07,971 --> 01:28:09,200
no one can get gasoline.

3696
01:28:09,201 --> 01:28:09,830
Like wow,

3697
01:28:09,830 --> 01:28:11,480
you got to rethink this whole thing.

3698
01:28:11,481 --> 01:28:13,880
Cause that fucker was designed
when people were on horses.

3699
01:28:13,910 --> 01:28:14,210
Yeah,

3700
01:28:14,210 --> 01:28:14,630
that's right.

3701
01:28:14,630 --> 01:28:15,463
That's right.

3702
01:28:15,710 --> 01:28:16,850
Are highly recommended.

3703
01:28:16,851 --> 01:28:19,430
Book the World Without
us by Alan Weissman,

3704
01:28:19,840 --> 01:28:20,390
uh,

3705
01:28:20,390 --> 01:28:20,960
who,

3706
01:28:20,960 --> 01:28:21,350
uh,

3707
01:28:21,350 --> 01:28:23,240
writes about like what would happen if,

3708
01:28:23,270 --> 01:28:25,550
if human beings vaporized
from our places now,

3709
01:28:25,580 --> 01:28:27,380
like what would happen on the next day?

3710
01:28:27,381 --> 01:28:27,980
Basically,

3711
01:28:27,980 --> 01:28:29,630
and it was his stuff about like,

3712
01:28:30,440 --> 01:28:30,771
you know,

3713
01:28:30,771 --> 01:28:32,630
everything from like feral cats,

3714
01:28:32,810 --> 01:28:33,081
right?

3715
01:28:33,081 --> 01:28:33,350
Would,

3716
01:28:33,350 --> 01:28:35,750
would those that weren't locked in,

3717
01:28:35,780 --> 01:28:35,961
you know,

3718
01:28:35,961 --> 01:28:39,290
the ones that were locked in would die
and then this number of them would be out

3719
01:28:39,291 --> 01:28:41,510
there and they would decimate
the rodent population.

3720
01:28:41,511 --> 01:28:46,511
Like he basically takes that fantastical
moment when everyone is vaporized.

3721
01:28:46,821 --> 01:28:47,271
And then he's like,

3722
01:28:47,271 --> 01:28:49,250
how long will the nuclear
power plants last?

3723
01:28:49,460 --> 01:28:50,660
How long before the houses,

3724
01:28:51,410 --> 01:28:51,890
you know,

3725
01:28:51,890 --> 01:28:55,190
a breakdown we a hundred
years and they all fall apart.

3726
01:28:55,191 --> 01:28:57,740
This office plaza were just like
come apart in a hundred years.

3727
01:28:58,580 --> 01:28:58,821
You know,

3728
01:28:58,821 --> 01:28:59,541
that kind of stuff is,

3729
01:28:59,541 --> 01:29:01,350
is a fascinating and,

3730
01:29:01,351 --> 01:29:06,351
and it's because like it requires so much
little gritty granular maintenance to

3731
01:29:06,751 --> 01:29:08,460
keep something like New York City going.

3732
01:29:08,750 --> 01:29:09,531
Well not only that,

3733
01:29:09,531 --> 01:29:10,364
the world,

3734
01:29:10,430 --> 01:29:11,480
the erosion,

3735
01:29:11,740 --> 01:29:12,070
the,

3736
01:29:12,070 --> 01:29:12,310
the,

3737
01:29:12,310 --> 01:29:14,120
the changing of the seasons,

3738
01:29:14,121 --> 01:29:14,391
the,

3739
01:29:14,391 --> 01:29:14,690
the,

3740
01:29:14,690 --> 01:29:18,860
the moving of the dirt on the
ground due to seismic activity.

3741
01:29:19,070 --> 01:29:22,730
We don't think about it in our time
because we only live to be a hundred years

3742
01:29:22,731 --> 01:29:23,511
and in a hundred years,

3743
01:29:23,511 --> 01:29:24,860
not a whole lot of things happen.

3744
01:29:24,861 --> 01:29:29,480
But over the course of a a billion
years plus there's nothing left.

3745
01:29:29,520 --> 01:29:31,740
Nature will have its way
with you with everything.

3746
01:29:32,900 --> 01:29:35,930
I was in Montana recently and
one of the coolest things about,

3747
01:29:35,931 --> 01:29:36,290
uh,

3748
01:29:36,290 --> 01:29:36,501
uh,

3749
01:29:36,501 --> 01:29:41,000
I was in the badlands and when we
were hiking through these hills,

3750
01:29:41,150 --> 01:29:45,140
you find seashells all over
the place because Montana,

3751
01:29:45,141 --> 01:29:45,620
that area,

3752
01:29:45,620 --> 01:29:48,530
Montana used to be something called
the Great Western inland sea.

3753
01:29:48,980 --> 01:29:50,690
Billions or millions of years ago,

3754
01:29:50,890 --> 01:29:55,570
they used to be fucking dinosaurs in
Montana and an ocean and inland ocean and

3755
01:29:55,650 --> 01:29:55,971
you're like,

3756
01:29:55,971 --> 01:29:56,421
wow,

3757
01:29:56,421 --> 01:29:57,230
like this.

3758
01:29:57,230 --> 01:29:57,891
It's not,

3759
01:29:57,891 --> 01:29:59,270
this ain't permanent like this.

3760
01:29:59,271 --> 01:30:01,790
This sort of thing just
keeps changing and shifting.

3761
01:30:01,791 --> 01:30:02,000
I mean,

3762
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:02,421
California,

3763
01:30:02,421 --> 01:30:02,490
yeah,

3764
01:30:02,490 --> 01:30:02,880
we're live,

3765
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:03,031
right?

3766
01:30:03,031 --> 01:30:05,010
All these dramatic seascapes and so forth.

3767
01:30:05,011 --> 01:30:05,250
Although,

3768
01:30:05,250 --> 01:30:05,521
you know,

3769
01:30:05,521 --> 01:30:07,710
waves crashing on the
beaches and all that stuff,

3770
01:30:07,711 --> 01:30:08,341
all that imagery.

3771
01:30:08,341 --> 01:30:08,790
Like,

3772
01:30:08,790 --> 01:30:09,031
man,

3773
01:30:09,031 --> 01:30:10,830
we are utterly,

3774
01:30:10,920 --> 01:30:11,753
uh,

3775
01:30:11,940 --> 01:30:13,530
living in a place that's
crumbling into the ocean.

3776
01:30:13,720 --> 01:30:15,000
It's just being eaten away.

3777
01:30:15,120 --> 01:30:17,100
And the people who have
a house on the beach,

3778
01:30:17,400 --> 01:30:19,050
you silly ass hole,

3779
01:30:19,350 --> 01:30:20,670
are you crazy?

3780
01:30:21,180 --> 01:30:23,580
Like I knew a guy who was building this,

3781
01:30:23,880 --> 01:30:26,400
I think it was like a
several million dollar house.

3782
01:30:26,401 --> 01:30:27,161
He's super rich.

3783
01:30:27,161 --> 01:30:28,440
She's his whole family's rich.

3784
01:30:28,441 --> 01:30:30,150
She's like one of those old money.

3785
01:30:30,151 --> 01:30:32,460
Dude's just some seems
to always have cash.

3786
01:30:32,850 --> 01:30:36,300
And we were talking about this play
shows me these architectural designs.

3787
01:30:36,301 --> 01:30:36,511
I'm like,

3788
01:30:36,511 --> 01:30:37,380
that's on the water.

3789
01:30:37,560 --> 01:30:39,630
What makes you think the
water is going to stay there?

3790
01:30:39,840 --> 01:30:40,351
Like it doesn't,

3791
01:30:40,351 --> 01:30:41,220
what if it goes back?

3792
01:30:41,221 --> 01:30:43,050
What if it goes from
yellow to contingency plan,

3793
01:30:43,280 --> 01:30:43,590
right?

3794
01:30:43,590 --> 01:30:43,950
No,

3795
01:30:43,950 --> 01:30:44,161
no.

3796
01:30:44,161 --> 01:30:48,330
You're just going to spend fucking $8
million on his crazy ass house that's on

3797
01:30:48,331 --> 01:30:49,710
the water right there.

3798
01:30:49,711 --> 01:30:50,544
Like total a lake.

3799
01:30:50,590 --> 01:30:51,280
So big,

3800
01:30:51,280 --> 01:30:53,790
so much more stable for a
few more for a few years.

3801
01:30:53,791 --> 01:30:55,110
We have a nice place to live,

3802
01:30:55,111 --> 01:30:55,870
but you're right.

3803
01:30:55,870 --> 01:30:59,040
But can you even get insurance
that the ocean will eat your house?

3804
01:30:59,150 --> 01:31:00,000
They know better now,

3805
01:31:00,001 --> 01:31:00,470
right?

3806
01:31:00,470 --> 01:31:01,390
I talked to a guy,

3807
01:31:01,391 --> 01:31:02,590
I interviewed a guy recently who,

3808
01:31:02,620 --> 01:31:03,160
um,

3809
01:31:03,160 --> 01:31:03,580
uh,

3810
01:31:03,580 --> 01:31:04,540
is a,

3811
01:31:04,630 --> 01:31:04,810
uh,

3812
01:31:04,810 --> 01:31:05,590
his job is,

3813
01:31:05,590 --> 01:31:07,740
is he owns a contractor,

3814
01:31:08,010 --> 01:31:11,470
a construction company or a deconstruction
company really that pulls oil rigs

3815
01:31:11,471 --> 01:31:12,304
out of the ocean,

3816
01:31:12,430 --> 01:31:13,390
wrecked oil rigs.

3817
01:31:13,391 --> 01:31:13,711
And he,

3818
01:31:13,711 --> 01:31:14,590
he in the,

3819
01:31:15,030 --> 01:31:15,400
uh,

3820
01:31:15,400 --> 01:31:18,880
in his twenties was designing oil rigs
and was describing what it was like to,

3821
01:31:18,881 --> 01:31:19,750
to design them back then.

3822
01:31:19,751 --> 01:31:20,321
And he said that,

3823
01:31:20,321 --> 01:31:20,980
uh,

3824
01:31:20,980 --> 01:31:21,813
um,

3825
01:31:21,940 --> 01:31:22,690
the,

3826
01:31:22,690 --> 01:31:23,380
uh,

3827
01:31:23,380 --> 01:31:28,380
the instructions from the instructor
back then was build it to this 60 year

3828
01:31:28,901 --> 01:31:30,670
storm standard.

3829
01:31:31,300 --> 01:31:32,740
And he was like,

3830
01:31:32,741 --> 01:31:34,780
but we've only been designing
all the rigs for 35 years.

3831
01:31:34,781 --> 01:31:36,790
How do we know what a 60
year storm looks like?

3832
01:31:36,791 --> 01:31:37,181
And they're like,

3833
01:31:37,181 --> 01:31:38,020
nevermind kid,

3834
01:31:38,080 --> 01:31:38,740
you know,

3835
01:31:38,740 --> 01:31:39,573
keep drawing.

3836
01:31:39,850 --> 01:31:43,050
So he's making these things and
he was explaining to us by way of,

3837
01:31:43,070 --> 01:31:45,520
of his then experience when Katrina hit,

3838
01:31:46,030 --> 01:31:46,630
um,

3839
01:31:46,630 --> 01:31:47,410
the,

3840
01:31:47,410 --> 01:31:47,830
uh,

3841
01:31:47,830 --> 01:31:49,630
the waves were so massive.

3842
01:31:49,631 --> 01:31:50,311
It was like a hundred,

3843
01:31:50,311 --> 01:31:50,480
you know,

3844
01:31:50,480 --> 01:31:53,050
was greater than a hundred year storm.

3845
01:31:53,410 --> 01:31:53,920
Um,

3846
01:31:53,920 --> 01:31:54,161
you know,

3847
01:31:54,161 --> 01:31:57,940
where were these decks that were designed
for 60 feet got hit with a hundred

3848
01:31:57,940 --> 01:31:58,570
foot waves,

3849
01:31:58,570 --> 01:31:58,840
you know,

3850
01:31:58,840 --> 01:32:00,100
it's unbelievable and

3851
01:32:00,100 --> 01:32:03,700
everything got torn down and
this guy now runs a versa bar.

3852
01:32:03,701 --> 01:32:03,940
This,

3853
01:32:03,940 --> 01:32:04,660
this company that,

3854
01:32:04,660 --> 01:32:04,950
that,

3855
01:32:04,950 --> 01:32:05,530
uh,

3856
01:32:05,530 --> 01:32:06,160
builds the,

3857
01:32:06,160 --> 01:32:11,160
this thing that can pull a whole oil rig
out of the ocean and carry it into land

3858
01:32:11,300 --> 01:32:13,480
because there's so many
that got wrecked by Katrina.

3859
01:32:13,780 --> 01:32:15,010
It's like its own industry.

3860
01:32:15,380 --> 01:32:15,580
Yeah.

3861
01:32:15,580 --> 01:32:16,570
And buy a hundred year storm.

3862
01:32:16,571 --> 01:32:18,340
You mean once every 100 years,

3863
01:32:18,370 --> 01:32:21,970
something cozy every year there's
a one in 100 chance or whatever.

3864
01:32:21,971 --> 01:32:22,151
Yeah,

3865
01:32:22,151 --> 01:32:22,601
exactly.

3866
01:32:22,601 --> 01:32:22,901
It's a,

3867
01:32:22,901 --> 01:32:23,261
it's a,

3868
01:32:23,261 --> 01:32:23,641
it's a,

3869
01:32:23,641 --> 01:32:24,820
the a hundred year storm.

3870
01:32:24,821 --> 01:32:25,121
That's right.

3871
01:32:25,121 --> 01:32:28,690
That's one of the creepiest ideas about
what's going to happen because of the

3872
01:32:28,691 --> 01:32:32,020
warming of the planet is that these
storms are going to happen more and more

3873
01:32:32,021 --> 01:32:32,830
often.

3874
01:32:32,830 --> 01:32:37,120
And we had a guy on here that was talking
about the possibility of hurricane

3875
01:32:37,121 --> 01:32:39,490
sandy being something
that happens every year.

3876
01:32:39,520 --> 01:32:39,910
Yeah.

3877
01:32:39,910 --> 01:32:40,151
Right.

3878
01:32:40,151 --> 01:32:41,370
You're going to have one of those a year.

3879
01:32:41,371 --> 01:32:43,150
Maybe that could change to two a year.

3880
01:32:43,150 --> 01:32:44,080
That could change the three,

3881
01:32:44,110 --> 01:32:44,291
you know,

3882
01:32:44,291 --> 01:32:44,540
the,

3883
01:32:44,540 --> 01:32:44,880
the,

3884
01:32:44,880 --> 01:32:45,910
the planet is built.

3885
01:32:45,911 --> 01:32:46,091
I mean,

3886
01:32:46,091 --> 01:32:46,331
you know,

3887
01:32:46,331 --> 01:32:47,800
the planet has built for equilibrium.

3888
01:32:47,801 --> 01:32:47,961
It's,

3889
01:32:47,961 --> 01:32:50,680
it's always trying to get
to equilibrium and yeah.

3890
01:32:50,800 --> 01:32:52,180
It just keeps changing.

3891
01:32:52,210 --> 01:32:52,740
That's right.

3892
01:32:52,740 --> 01:32:53,321
And you're a,

3893
01:32:53,321 --> 01:32:54,700
you're in northern California Guy,

3894
01:32:54,701 --> 01:32:55,020
right?

3895
01:32:55,020 --> 01:32:55,721
You live up there.

3896
01:32:55,721 --> 01:32:56,710
I live a weird life actually.

3897
01:32:56,711 --> 01:33:00,490
I go back and forth between New
York and California every month.

3898
01:33:00,670 --> 01:33:02,770
I'm in New York for one
week a month and then I,

3899
01:33:03,010 --> 01:33:05,650
my wife and daughter and are
in Oakland because we just,

3900
01:33:05,710 --> 01:33:07,900
we love California and I
happened to be living here when,

3901
01:33:07,950 --> 01:33:08,860
when the job came up,

3902
01:33:08,861 --> 01:33:09,280
so,

3903
01:33:09,280 --> 01:33:09,970
oh wow.

3904
01:33:09,970 --> 01:33:10,770
So,

3905
01:33:10,770 --> 01:33:11,110
you know,

3906
01:33:11,110 --> 01:33:12,640
in today's Day and age,

3907
01:33:12,641 --> 01:33:14,970
how much do you physically
have to be in a location?

3908
01:33:15,790 --> 01:33:16,390
I live in,

3909
01:33:16,390 --> 01:33:16,550
uh,

3910
01:33:16,550 --> 01:33:16,830
uh,

3911
01:33:16,830 --> 01:33:17,230
I,

3912
01:33:17,230 --> 01:33:20,860
I am sort of testing out that theory
that you don't have to be right with the

3913
01:33:20,861 --> 01:33:21,521
people you work,

3914
01:33:21,521 --> 01:33:21,640
you know,

3915
01:33:21,640 --> 01:33:22,570
so you work with,

3916
01:33:22,571 --> 01:33:26,560
so my staff is all in New York and I
communicate with them largely through the

3917
01:33:26,561 --> 01:33:27,010
phone.

3918
01:33:27,010 --> 01:33:28,420
I would say most of the time now.

3919
01:33:29,020 --> 01:33:32,740
But I went hard at the video telepresence
thing and I found that it's really

3920
01:33:32,741 --> 01:33:34,300
useful for a few kinds of conversations.

3921
01:33:34,301 --> 01:33:34,660
You know,

3922
01:33:34,660 --> 01:33:37,420
I can like make an announcement
or I can settle the debate,

3923
01:33:37,540 --> 01:33:37,811
you know,

3924
01:33:37,811 --> 01:33:40,030
I hear two sides and I make a
decision or something like that,

3925
01:33:40,031 --> 01:33:40,750
you know,

3926
01:33:40,750 --> 01:33:43,360
but it's not good for like
catching up with someone.

3927
01:33:43,390 --> 01:33:44,410
It's not good for,

3928
01:33:44,770 --> 01:33:45,603
you know,

3929
01:33:45,640 --> 01:33:47,350
sort of a confession.

3930
01:33:47,351 --> 01:33:47,550
Right.

3931
01:33:47,550 --> 01:33:47,730
Or,

3932
01:33:47,730 --> 01:33:48,031
or,

3933
01:33:48,031 --> 01:33:48,530
or you know,

3934
01:33:48,530 --> 01:33:48,810
uh,

3935
01:33:48,810 --> 01:33:49,010
you know,

3936
01:33:49,010 --> 01:33:49,843
personal,

3937
01:33:49,900 --> 01:33:50,591
personal stuff.

3938
01:33:50,591 --> 01:33:53,290
Anything where you want to win trust
or influenced something you're like,

3939
01:33:53,350 --> 01:33:55,870
I don't want to meet somebody that
I'm trying to impress that way.

3940
01:33:56,770 --> 01:33:57,760
And instead of trying,

3941
01:33:57,820 --> 01:33:59,800
you got to be face to face to
really connect with somebody.

3942
01:33:59,801 --> 01:34:04,600
I saw a fascinating aspect of the human
being and the human mind is the need for

3943
01:34:04,640 --> 01:34:05,290
like,

3944
01:34:05,290 --> 01:34:07,060
like if we were having this conversation,

3945
01:34:07,061 --> 01:34:10,150
there was six more feet of
desk between us that would,

3946
01:34:10,300 --> 01:34:12,730
that would change the
nature of the conversation.

3947
01:34:12,730 --> 01:34:13,280
Right.

3948
01:34:13,280 --> 01:34:14,560
We're not sitting at
this table the other way.

3949
01:34:14,740 --> 01:34:15,630
That's right.

3950
01:34:16,710 --> 01:34:17,620
That'd be like a banquet.

3951
01:34:17,820 --> 01:34:18,011
I mean,

3952
01:34:18,011 --> 01:34:18,910
we have headphones on.

3953
01:34:18,911 --> 01:34:20,290
I could see you if you were over there,

3954
01:34:20,291 --> 01:34:21,700
but it would feel weird.

3955
01:34:21,920 --> 01:34:25,150
It was like a good amount of distance
where we're like four feet from each

3956
01:34:25,151 --> 01:34:25,361
other.

3957
01:34:25,361 --> 01:34:25,750
That's right.

3958
01:34:25,750 --> 01:34:26,111
That's right.

3959
01:34:26,111 --> 01:34:28,000
You don't touch toes under
the desk too many times.

3960
01:34:28,570 --> 01:34:29,220
You know that theory.

3961
01:34:29,220 --> 01:34:30,180
That's why I made it this.

3962
01:34:30,190 --> 01:34:30,471
Why,

3963
01:34:30,471 --> 01:34:31,560
but at the ice house,

3964
01:34:31,570 --> 01:34:32,800
we have another place to the ice house.

3965
01:34:32,801 --> 01:34:35,800
And I was always touching toes with
people on the death changes the

3966
01:34:35,801 --> 01:34:36,281
conversation.

3967
01:34:36,281 --> 01:34:37,360
That's fucking footsie.

3968
01:34:38,740 --> 01:34:39,281
People wonder,

3969
01:34:39,281 --> 01:34:40,450
is he trying to say something?

3970
01:34:40,750 --> 01:34:41,360
He's trying to,

3971
01:34:41,360 --> 01:34:42,810
he's trying to talk like if you,

3972
01:34:42,890 --> 01:34:43,541
when I want to talk,

3973
01:34:43,541 --> 01:34:44,374
I'll touch your foot

3974
01:34:45,930 --> 01:34:46,180
now.

3975
01:34:46,180 --> 01:34:49,170
But what is that about
humans where we need this,

3976
01:34:49,171 --> 01:34:49,840
this sort of a,

3977
01:34:49,840 --> 01:34:50,770
we need a close,

3978
01:34:51,090 --> 01:34:51,341
I mean,

3979
01:34:51,341 --> 01:34:51,940
I think there's a,

3980
01:34:51,940 --> 01:34:52,271
I don't know,

3981
01:34:52,271 --> 01:34:52,601
but it's,

3982
01:34:52,601 --> 01:34:53,670
it's definitely hardwired.

3983
01:34:53,680 --> 01:34:54,070
There's the,

3984
01:34:54,070 --> 01:34:56,500
there's the uncanny valley
is this whole thing that,

3985
01:34:56,520 --> 01:34:56,870
uh,

3986
01:34:56,870 --> 01:34:58,070
they determined where

3987
01:34:58,250 --> 01:34:59,240
basically if you,

3988
01:34:59,390 --> 01:35:00,200
um,

3989
01:35:00,200 --> 01:35:03,440
if you show somebody a fake human face,

3990
01:35:03,680 --> 01:35:04,010
right?

3991
01:35:04,010 --> 01:35:04,910
The brain immediately,

3992
01:35:04,911 --> 01:35:05,270
it's like,

3993
01:35:05,270 --> 01:35:05,391
oh,

3994
01:35:05,391 --> 01:35:06,224
this is fake.

3995
01:35:06,350 --> 01:35:06,800
Uh,

3996
01:35:06,800 --> 01:35:08,390
and if you,

3997
01:35:08,440 --> 01:35:08,960
uh,

3998
01:35:08,960 --> 01:35:10,490
make it more and more lifelike,

3999
01:35:10,790 --> 01:35:14,960
basically roboticists study this and
trying to create a robot that could fool

4000
01:35:14,961 --> 01:35:16,580
the human right or making
a human comfortable.

4001
01:35:16,880 --> 01:35:17,570
Um,

4002
01:35:17,570 --> 01:35:19,700
and so like when you take a kid,

4003
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:20,241
well,

4004
01:35:20,241 --> 01:35:20,560
so,

4005
01:35:20,560 --> 01:35:23,930
so when it gets more and more uncanny,

4006
01:35:23,960 --> 01:35:24,250
right?

4007
01:35:24,250 --> 01:35:26,270
More and more like a person,

4008
01:35:26,510 --> 01:35:30,920
there's a point at which just before real
acceptance where you've really filled

4009
01:35:30,921 --> 01:35:31,754
a person where it,

4010
01:35:31,780 --> 01:35:32,130
the,

4011
01:35:32,130 --> 01:35:34,430
the acceptance rate drops off like,

4012
01:35:34,460 --> 01:35:35,510
like right.

4013
01:35:35,511 --> 01:35:35,811
As you get,

4014
01:35:35,811 --> 01:35:37,100
the closer you get to actual reality,

4015
01:35:37,101 --> 01:35:39,740
the more it freaks people out
to be talking to a fake person.

4016
01:35:40,070 --> 01:35:42,950
A really lifelike fake
person is way scarier than a,

4017
01:35:42,951 --> 01:35:43,431
not at all.

4018
01:35:43,431 --> 01:35:44,264
Like,

4019
01:35:44,540 --> 01:35:44,931
you know,

4020
01:35:44,931 --> 01:35:47,780
like a really lifelike fake
person that wants a fuck you

4021
01:35:49,940 --> 01:35:50,671
creepy with that.

4022
01:35:50,671 --> 01:35:51,610
I'd be like this man,

4023
01:35:51,690 --> 01:35:54,440
I don't think if you don't know
what it feels like to be a person,

4024
01:35:54,441 --> 01:35:55,580
you just imitating it.

4025
01:35:55,890 --> 01:35:56,271
I say,

4026
01:35:56,271 --> 01:35:56,691
no,

4027
01:35:56,691 --> 01:35:58,010
what the fuck are you going to do?

4028
01:35:59,390 --> 01:36:00,181
No means yes.

4029
01:36:00,181 --> 01:36:00,620
Yeah.

4030
01:36:00,620 --> 01:36:01,490
Like a fake,

4031
01:36:01,760 --> 01:36:02,151
fake,

4032
01:36:02,151 --> 01:36:04,540
crazy robot girl that wants
her deck and you gotta go,

4033
01:36:04,550 --> 01:36:05,030
listen,

4034
01:36:05,030 --> 01:36:07,340
this is not going to work for the red.

4035
01:36:07,610 --> 01:36:08,000
What did,

4036
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:09,050
what is your thoughts,

4037
01:36:09,080 --> 01:36:09,740
if any,

4038
01:36:09,740 --> 01:36:11,630
on remote viewing?

4039
01:36:11,690 --> 01:36:13,750
Are you aware of the
phenomenon or redevelopment?

4040
01:36:13,850 --> 01:36:14,300
Is that,

4041
01:36:14,300 --> 01:36:15,200
is that real?

4042
01:36:15,470 --> 01:36:17,960
I don't think it's real or at least it's
never been really enough that we wanted

4043
01:36:17,961 --> 01:36:18,860
to do a story on it.

4044
01:36:18,861 --> 01:36:20,810
So I don't think of it as a real thing,

4045
01:36:20,811 --> 01:36:22,880
but I'm interested to hear any
thoughts everyone has about it.

4046
01:36:23,060 --> 01:36:23,461
You know,

4047
01:36:23,461 --> 01:36:24,410
I don't know if it's real,

4048
01:36:24,411 --> 01:36:25,520
but we're having this guy,

4049
01:36:25,521 --> 01:36:25,731
uh,

4050
01:36:25,731 --> 01:36:29,720
his name is Russell Targ
and he's a physicist and uh,

4051
01:36:29,780 --> 01:36:30,210
he's,

4052
01:36:30,210 --> 01:36:31,043
uh,

4053
01:36:31,100 --> 01:36:32,210
he's also one of the,

4054
01:36:32,211 --> 01:36:32,630
uh,

4055
01:36:32,630 --> 01:36:35,810
a pioneer in the earliest development
of the laser and he's still a future

4056
01:36:35,811 --> 01:36:36,644
upcoming guests.

4057
01:36:36,950 --> 01:36:37,341
And,

4058
01:36:37,341 --> 01:36:37,551
uh,

4059
01:36:37,551 --> 01:36:39,350
he's written quite a few books on it,

4060
01:36:39,470 --> 01:36:40,220
on a man,

4061
01:36:40,220 --> 01:36:44,420
on listen when I'm remote viewing
and one on the reality of Esp.

4062
01:36:44,421 --> 01:36:47,150
It's called a physicist
proof psychic abilities.

4063
01:36:47,151 --> 01:36:48,830
I just got it in the mail today.

4064
01:36:48,840 --> 01:36:50,900
I haven't gotten into it,

4065
01:36:51,260 --> 01:36:54,620
but at the Stanford Research
Institute in 1970s and eighties.

4066
01:36:54,770 --> 01:36:56,090
Targ and his colleague,

4067
01:36:56,120 --> 01:37:00,590
a guy named Harold Lauff
cofounded a 23 year,

4068
01:37:00,591 --> 01:37:05,210
$25 million program of research into the
psychic abilities and their operational

4069
01:37:05,211 --> 01:37:07,970
use for the u s intelligence travel chair.

4070
01:37:07,971 --> 01:37:09,140
Like I said a couple of months ago,

4071
01:37:09,170 --> 01:37:09,561
including the,

4072
01:37:09,561 --> 01:37:10,281
I don't know what that means,

4073
01:37:10,281 --> 01:37:14,060
including the CIA Defense Intelligence
Agency and the army intelligence and

4074
01:37:14,061 --> 01:37:17,720
these abilities are referred to
collectively as remote viewing.

4075
01:37:18,020 --> 01:37:22,240
And they both expressed the belief
that it's possible and that they,

4076
01:37:22,241 --> 01:37:22,500
they,

4077
01:37:22,500 --> 01:37:26,960
they believe that there is actual physical
evidence that proves that people can

4078
01:37:26,961 --> 01:37:30,840
accurately describe and to pick things
that exist somewhere where they're

4079
01:37:30,860 --> 01:37:31,460
nowhere near.

4080
01:37:31,460 --> 01:37:34,310
It would be fascinating to
know whether they can prove it.

4081
01:37:34,540 --> 01:37:36,260
I've looked at any of that yet.

4082
01:37:36,360 --> 01:37:37,080
I mean,

4083
01:37:37,080 --> 01:37:37,980
I know about it.

4084
01:37:38,110 --> 01:37:38,640
Right.

4085
01:37:38,640 --> 01:37:39,240
You know,

4086
01:37:39,240 --> 01:37:41,910
in the spirit of not saying
anything negative about something,

4087
01:37:41,911 --> 01:37:43,740
I don't know a lot about,

4088
01:37:43,920 --> 01:37:44,281
you know,

4089
01:37:44,281 --> 01:37:46,650
I don't want to like shoot
it down right off the bat,

4090
01:37:46,680 --> 01:37:46,951
you know,

4091
01:37:46,951 --> 01:37:48,210
but it sounds,

4092
01:37:48,270 --> 01:37:49,650
it doesn't sound likely.

4093
01:37:49,830 --> 01:37:50,820
It sounds like fuckery.

4094
01:37:50,880 --> 01:37:51,713
Right,

4095
01:37:52,110 --> 01:37:52,381
right.

4096
01:37:52,381 --> 01:37:52,771
It does.

4097
01:37:52,771 --> 01:37:53,610
It sounds like it to me,

4098
01:37:54,240 --> 01:37:54,631
but I,

4099
01:37:54,631 --> 01:37:55,140
I you,

4100
01:37:55,140 --> 01:37:55,410
I,

4101
01:37:55,410 --> 01:37:56,010
we've had

4102
01:37:56,010 --> 01:37:56,221
a,

4103
01:37:56,221 --> 01:37:59,670
a friend Tim Ferriss in here who
described studies that are done,

4104
01:37:59,720 --> 01:38:00,050
um,

4105
01:38:00,050 --> 01:38:00,450
where,

4106
01:38:00,450 --> 01:38:03,810
where people accurately describe
things through remote remote viewing.

4107
01:38:04,230 --> 01:38:04,591
So,

4108
01:38:04,591 --> 01:38:04,810
uh,

4109
01:38:04,810 --> 01:38:05,070
I'm,

4110
01:38:05,070 --> 01:38:06,390
I'm really interested in that.

4111
01:38:06,420 --> 01:38:07,260
It also has been,

4112
01:38:07,870 --> 01:38:08,300
I don't,

4113
01:38:08,300 --> 01:38:10,350
this should say this is controversial,

4114
01:38:10,351 --> 01:38:14,520
but it's been written at least that it's
been proven statistically that people

4115
01:38:14,521 --> 01:38:16,350
can tell when people are looking at you,

4116
01:38:16,770 --> 01:38:20,700
that someone can more often than not be
accurate about whether or not someone is

4117
01:38:20,701 --> 01:38:21,271
looking at you.

4118
01:38:21,271 --> 01:38:23,370
Like you could feel the eyes on you.

4119
01:38:23,820 --> 01:38:24,810
I don't know.

4120
01:38:24,930 --> 01:38:26,610
I don't know whether that's true or not,

4121
01:38:26,611 --> 01:38:28,290
but I do know that there is a,

4122
01:38:28,560 --> 01:38:28,771
you know,

4123
01:38:28,771 --> 01:38:29,011
there's,

4124
01:38:29,011 --> 01:38:29,130
uh,

4125
01:38:29,130 --> 01:38:29,510
there's,

4126
01:38:29,510 --> 01:38:30,343
uh,

4127
01:38:30,420 --> 01:38:32,730
if you talk to a police detective,

4128
01:38:32,731 --> 01:38:32,941
you know,

4129
01:38:32,941 --> 01:38:36,510
they'll tell you that when
you interview witnesses,

4130
01:38:36,560 --> 01:38:37,060
they,

4131
01:38:37,060 --> 01:38:37,780
you know,

4132
01:38:37,780 --> 01:38:38,760
to an auto accident,

4133
01:38:38,761 --> 01:38:39,180
let's say.

4134
01:38:39,180 --> 01:38:41,140
They typically say that they saw the tar,

4135
01:38:41,170 --> 01:38:42,150
the cars collide,

4136
01:38:42,480 --> 01:38:46,920
when in fact they typically heard the
sound world around and then saw the

4137
01:38:46,921 --> 01:38:48,540
aftermath of the actual collision.

4138
01:38:48,840 --> 01:38:50,370
But their memory tells them,

4139
01:38:50,460 --> 01:38:53,460
this was me seeing the cars collide.

4140
01:38:53,910 --> 01:38:57,390
And so I wonder how
much of it is hindsight,

4141
01:38:57,450 --> 01:38:58,283
you know,

4142
01:38:58,380 --> 01:39:00,000
where's the memory stored?

4143
01:39:00,390 --> 01:39:00,780
Yeah,

4144
01:39:00,780 --> 01:39:01,520
good question.

4145
01:39:01,520 --> 01:39:01,890
Good,

4146
01:39:01,890 --> 01:39:02,401
good question.

4147
01:39:02,401 --> 01:39:02,551
Right.

4148
01:39:02,551 --> 01:39:03,000
I mean,

4149
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:03,391
the,

4150
01:39:03,391 --> 01:39:04,224
the,

4151
01:39:04,410 --> 01:39:05,243
uh,

4152
01:39:05,670 --> 01:39:07,290
the ability to,

4153
01:39:07,320 --> 01:39:07,770
to,

4154
01:39:07,770 --> 01:39:08,220
uh,

4155
01:39:08,220 --> 01:39:09,000
you know,

4156
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:13,530
really know where stuff is
happening is totally unbelievable.

4157
01:39:13,531 --> 01:39:13,711
You know,

4158
01:39:13,711 --> 01:39:14,544
you've got the like,

4159
01:39:14,640 --> 01:39:15,270
um,

4160
01:39:15,270 --> 01:39:18,210
the prefrontal cortex like
controls how you move your arms,

4161
01:39:18,211 --> 01:39:22,040
like we know some things
about where stuff is kept,

4162
01:39:22,050 --> 01:39:25,500
but like how it is affected,

4163
01:39:25,501 --> 01:39:26,700
how it truly is stored.

4164
01:39:26,701 --> 01:39:26,941
Is it,

4165
01:39:26,941 --> 01:39:28,770
is it binary or is it analog,

4166
01:39:28,771 --> 01:39:28,921
right?

4167
01:39:28,921 --> 01:39:30,390
Is it zeros and ones or is it like,

4168
01:39:30,391 --> 01:39:30,680
uh,

4169
01:39:30,680 --> 01:39:31,200
uh,

4170
01:39:31,200 --> 01:39:31,860
you know,

4171
01:39:31,860 --> 01:39:34,290
some sort of physical
arrangement of stuff like,

4172
01:39:34,320 --> 01:39:34,591
you know,

4173
01:39:34,591 --> 01:39:35,311
we don't know.

4174
01:39:35,311 --> 01:39:37,740
And we know that if you stimulate
certain parts of the brain,

4175
01:39:37,741 --> 01:39:38,940
you can rekindle memories,

4176
01:39:38,941 --> 01:39:39,240
right?

4177
01:39:39,240 --> 01:39:40,620
Or at rekindled the way,

4178
01:39:40,710 --> 01:39:43,290
the ability you have to retain memory.

4179
01:39:43,290 --> 01:39:44,880
I don't know that you can bring them back,

4180
01:39:44,881 --> 01:39:45,691
but you can certainly,

4181
01:39:45,691 --> 01:39:46,110
you know,

4182
01:39:46,110 --> 01:39:47,880
you can stimulate the part
of the brain that can,

4183
01:39:47,910 --> 01:39:48,480
that can,

4184
01:39:48,480 --> 01:39:49,313
uh,

4185
01:39:49,590 --> 01:39:51,240
help foster that for some reason.

4186
01:39:51,241 --> 01:39:51,631
But again,

4187
01:39:51,631 --> 01:39:52,021
this is us,

4188
01:39:52,021 --> 01:39:55,590
like it's us like poking on
the outside and seeing like,

4189
01:39:55,591 --> 01:39:56,424
oh sorry,

4190
01:39:56,490 --> 01:40:00,630
there's a far side cartoon from years
ago where the a group of doctors around

4191
01:40:00,631 --> 01:40:02,910
the table and one of the legs is going,

4192
01:40:02,911 --> 01:40:03,201
don't y'all,

4193
01:40:03,201 --> 01:40:03,321
y'all,

4194
01:40:03,321 --> 01:40:03,460
y'all,

4195
01:40:03,460 --> 01:40:04,440
y'all on one side.

4196
01:40:04,441 --> 01:40:04,681
And the,

4197
01:40:04,681 --> 01:40:05,400
and the doctor,

4198
01:40:05,400 --> 01:40:05,941
the nurse says,

4199
01:40:05,941 --> 01:40:06,091
you know,

4200
01:40:06,091 --> 01:40:06,781
careful doctors,

4201
01:40:06,781 --> 01:40:07,110
you know,

4202
01:40:07,110 --> 01:40:08,790
don't touch that part or leave that part,

4203
01:40:08,820 --> 01:40:09,121
you know,

4204
01:40:09,121 --> 01:40:09,600
or whatever it isn't.

4205
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:10,433
That's totally,

4206
01:40:10,710 --> 01:40:10,951
you know,

4207
01:40:10,951 --> 01:40:11,131
we're,

4208
01:40:11,131 --> 01:40:11,550
we're,

4209
01:40:11,550 --> 01:40:13,700
that's sort of where we're at in terms of,

4210
01:40:13,710 --> 01:40:14,010
of,

4211
01:40:14,010 --> 01:40:14,221
you know,

4212
01:40:14,221 --> 01:40:15,300
brain research.

4213
01:40:15,720 --> 01:40:19,590
I read this speculation once where there
was thinking that it was possible that

4214
01:40:20,010 --> 01:40:22,920
memories were in fact
stored in the neurons.

4215
01:40:23,490 --> 01:40:24,091
And the,

4216
01:40:24,091 --> 01:40:24,924
um,

4217
01:40:25,020 --> 01:40:30,020
the idea behind it was that human
cells regenerate every seven years.

4218
01:40:30,570 --> 01:40:35,570
Like pretty much every cell in your body
is completely regenerated every seven

4219
01:40:35,611 --> 01:40:37,110
years except the neurons.

4220
01:40:37,560 --> 01:40:41,010
Neurons tend to stay with you
for the rest of your life.

4221
01:40:41,080 --> 01:40:41,320
Yeah.

4222
01:40:41,320 --> 01:40:42,090
So that's the best thing.

4223
01:40:42,090 --> 01:40:43,500
Might be the only place for memories.

4224
01:40:43,620 --> 01:40:45,090
But I've thought about it and I said,

4225
01:40:45,091 --> 01:40:48,510
well maybe that's why your memory suck
when they're older than seven years old.

4226
01:40:48,630 --> 01:40:51,390
Cause they're like copies of
copies like an old VHS tape,

4227
01:40:52,290 --> 01:40:53,520
things would just get real,

4228
01:40:53,530 --> 01:40:54,363
get screening.

4229
01:40:54,640 --> 01:40:55,361
It's a little grainy.

4230
01:40:55,361 --> 01:40:57,680
It's in fact you were the
hero of that story instead of,

4231
01:40:57,690 --> 01:40:57,910
right,

4232
01:40:57,910 --> 01:40:58,090
right,

4233
01:40:58,090 --> 01:40:58,191
right,

4234
01:40:58,191 --> 01:40:58,410
right.

4235
01:40:58,410 --> 01:40:59,980
I've gone back over thing.

4236
01:41:00,010 --> 01:41:03,910
I mean I have some really definitive
life changing moments in my life that I'm

4237
01:41:03,911 --> 01:41:07,780
pretty sure I have the events clearly.

4238
01:41:07,781 --> 01:41:08,051
Right.

4239
01:41:08,051 --> 01:41:12,280
But if I allowed you into my
mind to look at what data I have,

4240
01:41:12,340 --> 01:41:17,340
I mean you basically have me regurgitating
some shit that I might've said when I

4241
01:41:18,161 --> 01:41:22,180
was 10 and then I'm saying it
over again when I'm 13 and again,

4242
01:41:22,181 --> 01:41:23,530
when I'm 16 and again,

4243
01:41:23,650 --> 01:41:24,161
you know what I mean?

4244
01:41:24,161 --> 01:41:29,161
And it's like I've kept repeating this
and referencing it or considering it.

4245
01:41:30,400 --> 01:41:32,080
So I have this,

4246
01:41:32,360 --> 01:41:33,430
this image of it.

4247
01:41:33,431 --> 01:41:34,990
But if you looked into my head,

4248
01:41:35,170 --> 01:41:37,240
some of the things that
I've done in my life,

4249
01:41:37,270 --> 01:41:37,691
you know,

4250
01:41:37,691 --> 01:41:38,650
and some of the things that,

4251
01:41:38,680 --> 01:41:38,980
you know,

4252
01:41:38,980 --> 01:41:40,540
really big moments in my life,

4253
01:41:40,900 --> 01:41:41,711
all you'd find,

4254
01:41:41,711 --> 01:41:45,850
it's like a few fucking blurry images
and maybe some reference points.

4255
01:41:46,600 --> 01:41:47,620
And if you look at the way that,

4256
01:41:47,700 --> 01:41:48,533
that,

4257
01:41:48,650 --> 01:41:48,950
you know,

4258
01:41:48,950 --> 01:41:49,830
we have learned,

4259
01:41:49,860 --> 01:41:49,971
I mean,

4260
01:41:49,971 --> 01:41:50,250
one,

4261
01:41:50,250 --> 01:41:54,870
one place that we have learned the brain
pretty well is anesthesia because you

4262
01:41:54,871 --> 01:41:55,530
end up,

4263
01:41:55,530 --> 01:41:56,190
um,

4264
01:41:56,190 --> 01:41:56,910
uh,

4265
01:41:56,910 --> 01:42:00,030
w we know now how to turn off
things like short term memory,

4266
01:42:00,300 --> 01:42:03,220
so the latest forms and we eat well,

4267
01:42:03,240 --> 01:42:04,830
is that the way to do solid.

4268
01:42:04,831 --> 01:42:05,664
Exactly.

4269
01:42:05,800 --> 01:42:06,240
Um,

4270
01:42:06,240 --> 01:42:08,790
but if you're going to crack open the
chest to get the baby out or whatever the

4271
01:42:08,791 --> 01:42:09,070
thing is,

4272
01:42:09,070 --> 01:42:10,320
clammed the clam,

4273
01:42:10,620 --> 01:42:10,951
uh,

4274
01:42:10,951 --> 01:42:11,161
you know,

4275
01:42:11,161 --> 01:42:12,300
you're going to need a different,

4276
01:42:12,320 --> 01:42:12,890
uh,

4277
01:42:12,890 --> 01:42:13,250
you know,

4278
01:42:13,250 --> 01:42:14,083
need some serious drugs.

4279
01:42:14,280 --> 01:42:15,720
So they turn off the,

4280
01:42:15,790 --> 01:42:16,800
they turn off the,

4281
01:42:16,801 --> 01:42:17,160
the,

4282
01:42:17,160 --> 01:42:18,330
your memory basically.

4283
01:42:18,360 --> 01:42:23,360
And it's not so much that they're turning
off the body is a sensation of the

4284
01:42:23,581 --> 01:42:25,920
pain as much as they're
turning off your memory of it,

4285
01:42:26,220 --> 01:42:26,461
uh,

4286
01:42:26,461 --> 01:42:28,860
so that you're not really
experiencing it consciously,

4287
01:42:29,070 --> 01:42:30,660
but you still in that state,

4288
01:42:30,661 --> 01:42:31,830
your blood pressure goes up.

4289
01:42:31,831 --> 01:42:36,030
Like your body is feeling pain and an
anesthesiologist is managing that pain for

4290
01:42:36,031 --> 01:42:36,240
you.

4291
01:42:36,240 --> 01:42:37,470
But the idea is to turn off your,

4292
01:42:37,710 --> 01:42:40,770
your memory more than
your nerve receptors,

4293
01:42:40,771 --> 01:42:41,610
which is amazing.

4294
01:42:41,611 --> 01:42:43,730
So when you're unconscious
in an anesthesia,

4295
01:42:43,830 --> 01:42:44,351
the in,

4296
01:42:44,351 --> 01:42:46,950
in an anesthesia steak
or an anesthetized state,

4297
01:42:46,951 --> 01:42:47,460
right,

4298
01:42:47,460 --> 01:42:48,120
your,

4299
01:42:48,120 --> 01:42:50,910
your body still is sending the signals,

4300
01:42:50,911 --> 01:42:51,480
right.

4301
01:42:51,480 --> 01:42:54,030
But not like a sleeping
person who would wake up

4302
01:42:54,440 --> 01:42:55,360
the memory shutoff.

4303
01:42:55,420 --> 01:42:55,550
Yeah.

4304
01:42:55,550 --> 01:42:56,300
You're not even,

4305
01:42:56,300 --> 01:42:58,460
you're not having the
experience consciously.

4306
01:42:58,520 --> 01:42:58,850
Uh,

4307
01:42:58,850 --> 01:42:59,331
so your,

4308
01:42:59,331 --> 01:43:01,370
your body is not jolting you awake.

4309
01:43:01,371 --> 01:43:04,160
It's just turning that off so
you're not absorbing it at all.

4310
01:43:04,161 --> 01:43:06,560
The hippocampus is not
translating that into,

4311
01:43:06,710 --> 01:43:08,510
into long term memories
for whatever reason.

4312
01:43:08,550 --> 01:43:09,680
I'm not sure quite how it works,

4313
01:43:09,681 --> 01:43:11,180
but as a result,

4314
01:43:11,210 --> 01:43:11,570
you,

4315
01:43:11,570 --> 01:43:12,403
you,

4316
01:43:12,650 --> 01:43:12,891
yeah,

4317
01:43:12,891 --> 01:43:13,101
your,

4318
01:43:13,101 --> 01:43:15,350
your body still is free to respond.

4319
01:43:15,351 --> 01:43:16,700
I think that an
anesthesiologist would say,

4320
01:43:16,701 --> 01:43:17,534
hey,

4321
01:43:17,600 --> 01:43:18,500
it really depends.

4322
01:43:18,501 --> 01:43:21,200
There's some procedures
where that's not the case.

4323
01:43:21,520 --> 01:43:21,830
Um,

4324
01:43:21,830 --> 01:43:26,300
but it also is healthy or
not to turn off too much.

4325
01:43:26,330 --> 01:43:28,280
You don't want to turn off
a lot of the body you want,

4326
01:43:28,281 --> 01:43:28,640
you know,

4327
01:43:28,640 --> 01:43:30,440
they have to sometimes
depending on the procedure.

4328
01:43:30,441 --> 01:43:31,490
But you want to,

4329
01:43:31,491 --> 01:43:31,851
I think,

4330
01:43:31,851 --> 01:43:34,040
keep a lot of it as you know,

4331
01:43:34,280 --> 01:43:36,590
going of its own accord
as much as possible.

4332
01:43:36,770 --> 01:43:37,470
Well then there's

4333
01:43:37,470 --> 01:43:38,340
brain surgery,

4334
01:43:38,341 --> 01:43:40,710
which is even fucking crazier.

4335
01:43:40,770 --> 01:43:45,770
And the fact that there was a of
general consensus amongst doctors and

4336
01:43:46,021 --> 01:43:50,850
scientists just mean how many decades
ago where they were doing lobotomies were

4337
01:43:50,851 --> 01:43:51,321
there are gone,

4338
01:43:51,321 --> 01:43:51,980
this dude's fucked

4339
01:43:51,980 --> 01:43:52,131
up,

4340
01:43:52,131 --> 01:43:52,881
let's drill a hole in.

4341
01:43:52,881 --> 01:43:55,580
His brain's scrambled
that frontal lobe and see,

4342
01:43:55,610 --> 01:43:57,230
see if we can get a
nicer person out of it.

4343
01:43:57,231 --> 01:43:57,411
Yeah,

4344
01:43:57,411 --> 01:43:57,770
yeah.

4345
01:43:57,770 --> 01:43:58,011
No,

4346
01:43:58,011 --> 01:43:58,340
I know.

4347
01:43:58,340 --> 01:43:59,060
It's uh,

4348
01:43:59,060 --> 01:43:59,360
the,

4349
01:43:59,360 --> 01:44:00,050
the,

4350
01:44:00,050 --> 01:44:03,830
the idea that anybody would sort of really
mess around with the brain back then

4351
01:44:03,860 --> 01:44:05,480
considering how little we know now,

4352
01:44:05,810 --> 01:44:06,350
you know,

4353
01:44:06,350 --> 01:44:09,800
the fact that we need $3 billion worth
of research to get oriented is basically

4354
01:44:09,801 --> 01:44:10,634
what that would do.

4355
01:44:11,120 --> 01:44:11,601
A man,

4356
01:44:11,601 --> 01:44:11,841
you know,

4357
01:44:11,841 --> 01:44:12,350
like yeah.

4358
01:44:12,350 --> 01:44:13,700
Nobody should be scrambling anybody.

4359
01:44:13,701 --> 01:44:13,821
Yeah.

4360
01:44:13,821 --> 01:44:14,654
What does that,

4361
01:44:14,720 --> 01:44:15,321
what was it called?

4362
01:44:15,321 --> 01:44:16,370
Trip panning.

4363
01:44:16,760 --> 01:44:20,750
Think where they would drill holes
in the skull to release pressure,

4364
01:44:20,840 --> 01:44:21,380
man,

4365
01:44:21,380 --> 01:44:21,830
man.

4366
01:44:21,830 --> 01:44:22,850
And sometimes they have to do that,

4367
01:44:22,851 --> 01:44:23,120
you know,

4368
01:44:23,120 --> 01:44:24,110
like emergency surgery,

4369
01:44:24,111 --> 01:44:24,680
you have to,

4370
01:44:24,680 --> 01:44:24,891
you know,

4371
01:44:24,891 --> 01:44:26,020
somebody will whack their head,

4372
01:44:26,910 --> 01:44:27,131
you know,

4373
01:44:27,131 --> 01:44:27,660
and then they,

4374
01:44:27,660 --> 01:44:28,491
they have to do that sometimes.

4375
01:44:28,491 --> 01:44:28,791
But yeah,

4376
01:44:28,791 --> 01:44:32,810
the idea that you would do that to try
and sort of like affect behavior is nuts.

4377
01:44:33,050 --> 01:44:33,261
You know,

4378
01:44:33,261 --> 01:44:33,711
on the other hand,

4379
01:44:33,711 --> 01:44:34,940
they have discovered things like,

4380
01:44:35,390 --> 01:44:36,223
um,

4381
01:44:36,470 --> 01:44:37,010
uh,

4382
01:44:37,010 --> 01:44:37,811
you know,

4383
01:44:37,811 --> 01:44:38,240
uh,

4384
01:44:38,240 --> 01:44:38,541
uh,

4385
01:44:38,541 --> 01:44:39,141
what's it called?

4386
01:44:39,141 --> 01:44:39,974
Um,

4387
01:44:40,070 --> 01:44:40,940
shock treatment,

4388
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:41,330
right?

4389
01:44:41,330 --> 01:44:41,700
Was,

4390
01:44:41,700 --> 01:44:43,040
was this desire to sort of,

4391
01:44:43,430 --> 01:44:47,070
you could calm the brain
in a way by hitting,

4392
01:44:47,210 --> 01:44:48,110
by jolting it.

4393
01:44:48,590 --> 01:44:49,160
Um,

4394
01:44:49,160 --> 01:44:50,090
and uh,

4395
01:44:50,120 --> 01:44:50,780
it comes,

4396
01:44:50,780 --> 01:44:55,310
it was discovered basically
by the original sort of
discovery that led to that

4397
01:44:55,340 --> 01:44:57,660
was a in slaughterhouses,

4398
01:44:58,030 --> 01:44:58,340
uh,

4399
01:44:58,340 --> 01:45:00,920
they would stun the cattle ahead of time,

4400
01:45:00,990 --> 01:45:01,130
uh,

4401
01:45:01,130 --> 01:45:02,210
with like a shot to the,

4402
01:45:02,610 --> 01:45:03,180
you know,

4403
01:45:03,180 --> 01:45:04,670
to the brow basically with a,

4404
01:45:04,680 --> 01:45:05,340
um,

4405
01:45:05,340 --> 01:45:06,010
on one of those,

4406
01:45:06,010 --> 01:45:06,420
uh,

4407
01:45:06,420 --> 01:45:06,710
uh,

4408
01:45:06,710 --> 01:45:08,270
not nail guns but a rivet gun.

4409
01:45:09,290 --> 01:45:10,960
And as a result,

4410
01:45:10,970 --> 01:45:11,361
the and the,

4411
01:45:11,361 --> 01:45:11,810
and the,

4412
01:45:11,810 --> 01:45:12,380
the car,

4413
01:45:12,380 --> 01:45:16,070
the cow would go incredibly calm and then
a whole body of research sort of grew

4414
01:45:16,071 --> 01:45:18,020
out of that dynamic
trying to figure out like,

4415
01:45:18,021 --> 01:45:20,370
what is the shot to the
system that calms the body.

4416
01:45:20,370 --> 01:45:21,620
It calms the mind for a second.

4417
01:45:21,800 --> 01:45:26,600
And for the longest time they weren't
doing electroshock therapy on humans.

4418
01:45:26,601 --> 01:45:27,560
They stopped doing it.

4419
01:45:28,010 --> 01:45:31,640
There was the sort of one flow is the
one flew over the cuckoo's nest way of

4420
01:45:31,641 --> 01:45:32,331
looking at it like,

4421
01:45:32,331 --> 01:45:32,511
oh,

4422
01:45:32,511 --> 01:45:33,620
you just ruined that guy.

4423
01:45:33,621 --> 01:45:34,820
He had calmed him down,

4424
01:45:34,821 --> 01:45:35,860
but you shut you,

4425
01:45:35,861 --> 01:45:38,870
you know that Jack Nicholson drooling
at the end of the movie where it's,

4426
01:45:38,890 --> 01:45:39,021
Oh,

4427
01:45:39,021 --> 01:45:39,591
he's gone,

4428
01:45:39,591 --> 01:45:40,101
he's fucked.

4429
01:45:40,101 --> 01:45:41,360
He cooked his brain towards,

4430
01:45:41,361 --> 01:45:42,194
now it's,

4431
01:45:42,650 --> 01:45:44,570
it's commonly done to
people that are fucked up.

4432
01:45:44,680 --> 01:45:46,010
I think they also known now.

4433
01:45:46,011 --> 01:45:47,690
So back then you had what were called,

4434
01:45:47,750 --> 01:45:48,583
uh,

4435
01:45:48,610 --> 01:45:48,800
you know,

4436
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:50,000
we're back on site and as iconic here,

4437
01:45:50,001 --> 01:45:50,610
but there was,

4438
01:45:50,610 --> 01:45:53,510
you had positive and negative
symptoms and that's a technical term.

4439
01:45:53,511 --> 01:45:54,650
It doesn't mean good or bad.

4440
01:45:54,651 --> 01:45:56,720
It means a positive symptoms
where the symptoms where you,

4441
01:45:56,780 --> 01:45:58,010
you have an outburst side,

4442
01:45:58,011 --> 01:46:00,230
they're outwardly noticeable,

4443
01:46:00,530 --> 01:46:01,230
uh,

4444
01:46:01,230 --> 01:46:01,730
outbursts,

4445
01:46:01,730 --> 01:46:02,270
you know,

4446
01:46:02,270 --> 01:46:02,780
yelling,

4447
01:46:02,780 --> 01:46:03,650
hallucinations,

4448
01:46:03,651 --> 01:46:04,450
potters are part of it.

4449
01:46:04,450 --> 01:46:07,670
And the negative is a lack
of emotional connection,

4450
01:46:07,910 --> 01:46:10,520
lack of reasoning or cognitive
abilities starts to go away.

4451
01:46:10,521 --> 01:46:11,030
And those are,

4452
01:46:11,030 --> 01:46:11,570
those were,

4453
01:46:11,570 --> 01:46:11,871
you know,

4454
01:46:11,871 --> 01:46:13,760
a whole separate category of symptoms.

4455
01:46:14,300 --> 01:46:17,870
And back then in the early days of
something like electroshock therapy,

4456
01:46:17,871 --> 01:46:19,670
they typically only had
something like thorazine,

4457
01:46:19,671 --> 01:46:20,480
lithium,

4458
01:46:20,480 --> 01:46:20,990
um,

4459
01:46:20,990 --> 01:46:22,580
to sort of turn off all it,

4460
01:46:22,640 --> 01:46:24,560
all it would turn off was
your positive symptoms,

4461
01:46:24,561 --> 01:46:26,330
but it didn't affect any of your,

4462
01:46:26,810 --> 01:46:27,340
uh,

4463
01:46:27,340 --> 01:46:28,040
um,

4464
01:46:28,040 --> 01:46:28,940
negative symptoms.

4465
01:46:28,941 --> 01:46:29,260
The,

4466
01:46:29,260 --> 01:46:29,950
the,

4467
01:46:29,950 --> 01:46:30,410
you know,

4468
01:46:30,410 --> 01:46:32,570
being you're still lethargic,

4469
01:46:32,571 --> 01:46:33,980
he still can't make connections to people.

4470
01:46:33,981 --> 01:46:34,880
You're still not thinking,

4471
01:46:34,881 --> 01:46:35,714
well,

4472
01:46:35,900 --> 01:46:37,190
plus you're sort of sedated.

4473
01:46:37,191 --> 01:46:39,080
So they talked about
the thorazine shuffle,

4474
01:46:39,320 --> 01:46:39,561
you know,

4475
01:46:39,561 --> 01:46:40,220
that was back.

4476
01:46:40,220 --> 01:46:41,480
And so I wonder if some of it,

4477
01:46:41,630 --> 01:46:42,560
I'm just making this up,

4478
01:46:42,561 --> 01:46:43,430
but I wonder if,

4479
01:46:43,490 --> 01:46:47,480
if some of it is people
would get jolted and then,

4480
01:46:47,750 --> 01:46:48,440
um,

4481
01:46:48,440 --> 01:46:52,830
after beyond this medication typically
and be shuffling around and people would

4482
01:46:52,831 --> 01:46:53,221
all be like,

4483
01:46:53,221 --> 01:46:53,341
oh,

4484
01:46:53,341 --> 01:46:55,620
that guy was never the same since
he had his electroshock therapy.

4485
01:46:55,620 --> 01:46:58,100
But maybe he was also on the drug
that was turning them all right.

4486
01:46:58,110 --> 01:46:58,530
I'm just,

4487
01:46:58,530 --> 01:46:58,950
I dunno,

4488
01:46:58,950 --> 01:46:59,820
I'm just making that up,

4489
01:46:59,821 --> 01:47:01,200
but it certainly couldn't get involved.

4490
01:47:01,230 --> 01:47:03,900
It's so funny how we look
back at those days and go,

4491
01:47:03,901 --> 01:47:04,081
oh,

4492
01:47:04,081 --> 01:47:05,010
those fucking dummies.

4493
01:47:05,011 --> 01:47:05,850
They didn't know they were doing.

4494
01:47:06,060 --> 01:47:10,080
But guaranteed people a thousand years
from now are going to be looking at us.

4495
01:47:10,740 --> 01:47:11,640
We're so silly.

4496
01:47:12,030 --> 01:47:12,900
We didn't know anything.

4497
01:47:12,930 --> 01:47:15,570
We didn't even have artificial brains
yet cause they were still driving

4498
01:47:15,571 --> 01:47:16,404
ourselves.

4499
01:47:16,490 --> 01:47:16,800
Yeah,

4500
01:47:16,800 --> 01:47:17,580
that's right.

4501
01:47:17,580 --> 01:47:21,270
What is your thoughts on
a ray Kurzweil's idea of,

4502
01:47:21,271 --> 01:47:25,620
of humanism that we are eventually going
to be symbiotic with some sort of a

4503
01:47:25,740 --> 01:47:26,880
machine counterpart?

4504
01:47:26,970 --> 01:47:27,391
I love it.

4505
01:47:27,391 --> 01:47:27,630
I mean,

4506
01:47:27,630 --> 01:47:28,440
I think it's a,

4507
01:47:28,440 --> 01:47:29,820
it's a really interesting,

4508
01:47:29,821 --> 01:47:30,061
you know,

4509
01:47:30,061 --> 01:47:31,380
it's a great time reference.

4510
01:47:31,381 --> 01:47:33,020
That's basically what he's
trying to do is say like,

4511
01:47:33,090 --> 01:47:36,510
here's the next great milestone
in innovation and development.

4512
01:47:36,540 --> 01:47:36,721
You know,

4513
01:47:36,721 --> 01:47:36,990
and I,

4514
01:47:36,990 --> 01:47:37,350
I,

4515
01:47:37,350 --> 01:47:38,970
I think it's a nice,

4516
01:47:39,300 --> 01:47:39,640
uh,

4517
01:47:39,640 --> 01:47:41,340
a really good organizing principle.

4518
01:47:41,341 --> 01:47:42,780
It's inspired a lot of great thinking.

4519
01:47:42,781 --> 01:47:43,051
You know,

4520
01:47:43,051 --> 01:47:47,280
whether it's going to turn out that
we really do create like a symbiotic,

4521
01:47:47,350 --> 01:47:47,880
you know,

4522
01:47:47,880 --> 01:47:48,361
relationship.

4523
01:47:48,361 --> 01:47:48,900
I Dunno,

4524
01:47:48,900 --> 01:47:50,250
but in a way we already have,

4525
01:47:50,251 --> 01:47:50,421
right?

4526
01:47:50,421 --> 01:47:52,650
Like if you've got the new galaxy,

4527
01:47:52,651 --> 01:47:52,771
blah,

4528
01:47:52,771 --> 01:47:52,861
blah,

4529
01:47:52,861 --> 01:47:52,941
blah,

4530
01:47:52,941 --> 01:47:53,191
blah.

4531
01:47:53,191 --> 01:47:54,660
And with Google,

4532
01:47:54,690 --> 01:47:58,050
when you turn on that first a
little screen that tells you like,

4533
01:47:58,051 --> 01:47:58,561
here's the time,

4534
01:47:58,561 --> 01:47:59,790
here's the weather near you.

4535
01:48:00,080 --> 01:48:00,420
Um,

4536
01:48:00,420 --> 01:48:00,751
you,

4537
01:48:00,751 --> 01:48:02,100
it will also follow,

4538
01:48:02,101 --> 01:48:02,570
uh,

4539
01:48:02,570 --> 01:48:03,320
uh,

4540
01:48:03,320 --> 01:48:03,680
you,

4541
01:48:03,680 --> 01:48:03,901
you know,

4542
01:48:03,901 --> 01:48:04,711
it'll track your day,

4543
01:48:04,711 --> 01:48:05,280
your time,

4544
01:48:05,280 --> 01:48:09,330
like where are you are and begin to pick
up the history over time of where you

4545
01:48:09,331 --> 01:48:09,960
are.

4546
01:48:09,960 --> 01:48:11,130
And it'll start to suggest like,

4547
01:48:11,131 --> 01:48:14,700
here's a better route to
take to work or you know,

4548
01:48:14,730 --> 01:48:19,730
here's food near you and your w it's
telling you information before you're even

4549
01:48:20,161 --> 01:48:20,821
asking for it.

4550
01:48:20,821 --> 01:48:23,010
Which for me is a totally new,

4551
01:48:23,011 --> 01:48:23,221
you know,

4552
01:48:23,221 --> 01:48:25,410
are crossing this line
where it's no longer like,

4553
01:48:25,440 --> 01:48:25,561
oh,

4554
01:48:25,561 --> 01:48:25,861
I'm hungry,

4555
01:48:25,861 --> 01:48:26,790
I want to go eat something.

4556
01:48:26,880 --> 01:48:29,970
And then you pull out your phone to ask
it how to do that instead of the phone

4557
01:48:29,971 --> 01:48:30,960
is telling you,

4558
01:48:31,320 --> 01:48:32,153
Hey,

4559
01:48:32,350 --> 01:48:32,941
I've got an idea,

4560
01:48:32,941 --> 01:48:33,750
why don't you get a burger?

4561
01:48:33,750 --> 01:48:34,111
And you're like,

4562
01:48:34,111 --> 01:48:34,980
thanks phone.

4563
01:48:36,720 --> 01:48:39,030
And so in a way we've
almost already gotten there,

4564
01:48:39,031 --> 01:48:39,500
you know,

4565
01:48:39,500 --> 01:48:42,600
and the biggest giveaway is how weird
you feel when you leave it at home.

4566
01:48:42,950 --> 01:48:43,070
Right?

4567
01:48:43,070 --> 01:48:43,903
Your phone.

4568
01:48:45,240 --> 01:48:47,490
I didn't use my phone for
almost two days this weekend.

4569
01:48:47,491 --> 01:48:48,930
It was the best feeling ever.

4570
01:48:49,050 --> 01:48:52,230
And I've noticed that one of the biggest
things with hipsters nowadays is that

4571
01:48:52,231 --> 01:48:53,700
they don't have cell phones anymore.

4572
01:48:54,060 --> 01:48:57,180
And I could kind of see
myself even going back there.

4573
01:48:57,840 --> 01:49:01,040
Really the big thing with
hips or heard of that.

4574
01:49:01,050 --> 01:49:01,201
Yeah.

4575
01:49:01,201 --> 01:49:02,980
The new thing has hipsters
don't have cell phones,

4576
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:03,840
so that's great.

4577
01:49:03,900 --> 01:49:04,710
And that they just,

4578
01:49:04,710 --> 01:49:05,820
they just write letters.

4579
01:49:08,220 --> 01:49:09,360
I'm being a hundred percent serious.

4580
01:49:09,361 --> 01:49:11,510
I just found out about it this way from,

4581
01:49:11,600 --> 01:49:11,891
uh,

4582
01:49:11,891 --> 01:49:16,200
this girl I know is working on a movie
and I guess there's a couple of people

4583
01:49:16,201 --> 01:49:17,160
that are so hipster.

4584
01:49:17,161 --> 01:49:18,600
It's that they don't have phones in the,

4585
01:49:18,601 --> 01:49:20,640
so she has to like email them.

4586
01:49:20,760 --> 01:49:21,031
That's,

4587
01:49:21,031 --> 01:49:22,140
so that's great.

4588
01:49:22,290 --> 01:49:23,123
Like wow.

4589
01:49:23,840 --> 01:49:25,000
It's like the steam punk thing.

4590
01:49:25,230 --> 01:49:27,180
Looking back at that time,

4591
01:49:27,200 --> 01:49:29,310
trying to find out from this is
good if you don't have a phone,

4592
01:49:30,600 --> 01:49:31,590
that's ridiculous.

4593
01:49:31,920 --> 01:49:32,880
That's so stupid.

4594
01:49:33,420 --> 01:49:34,920
Why you don't have to use her dummy.

4595
01:49:35,010 --> 01:49:36,270
But the fact that you don't have one,

4596
01:49:36,400 --> 01:49:37,233
but I'm

4597
01:49:38,400 --> 01:49:40,290
not using your phone for two days.

4598
01:49:40,300 --> 01:49:41,133
It's

4599
01:49:42,670 --> 01:49:45,480
a ate mushrooms and swam with dolphins.

4600
01:49:47,020 --> 01:49:48,190
It when I went to Montana

4601
01:49:48,190 --> 01:49:50,320
for six days for six days,

4602
01:49:50,321 --> 01:49:51,110
no cell phone.

4603
01:49:51,110 --> 01:49:51,330
Great.

4604
01:49:51,330 --> 01:49:51,700
Right?

4605
01:49:51,700 --> 01:49:52,191
Yeah.

4606
01:49:52,191 --> 01:49:52,390
It's,

4607
01:49:52,390 --> 01:49:52,870
it's,

4608
01:49:52,870 --> 01:49:53,320
well,

4609
01:49:53,320 --> 01:49:56,380
it's also good to get the
fuck away from the hive,

4610
01:49:56,470 --> 01:49:57,161
you know,

4611
01:49:57,161 --> 01:49:59,740
cause we were camping for
those days that were out there,

4612
01:49:59,830 --> 01:50:01,390
so it wasn't just no cell phone,

4613
01:50:01,391 --> 01:50:03,560
there was no contact with civilized world.

4614
01:50:03,561 --> 01:50:06,730
It was just the natural world
of walking around and hiking.

4615
01:50:06,731 --> 01:50:07,870
And it's a,

4616
01:50:07,871 --> 01:50:11,530
it's a completely different feeling than
when you're constantly checking your

4617
01:50:11,531 --> 01:50:12,071
email,

4618
01:50:12,071 --> 01:50:15,700
constantly watching the CNN screen
at the airport and all that,

4619
01:50:15,720 --> 01:50:15,920
that,

4620
01:50:15,920 --> 01:50:19,240
that they leave the constant
input of information.

4621
01:50:19,870 --> 01:50:23,200
Do you have any experience at all
in a sensory deprivation tanks?

4622
01:50:23,590 --> 01:50:23,951
No,

4623
01:50:23,951 --> 01:50:24,790
not me personally.

4624
01:50:24,820 --> 01:50:26,380
I am really interested in,

4625
01:50:26,570 --> 01:50:28,660
you had said earlier when we were
looking at that footage of the,

4626
01:50:28,661 --> 01:50:29,494
um,

4627
01:50:29,710 --> 01:50:31,830
the cumulus cloud and the
soldiers running toward it,

4628
01:50:31,840 --> 01:50:33,550
like how fragile the body is.

4629
01:50:33,580 --> 01:50:34,031
That's my,

4630
01:50:34,031 --> 01:50:34,570
like,

4631
01:50:34,570 --> 01:50:37,120
that's the subject I
geek out on the hardest.

4632
01:50:37,120 --> 01:50:40,720
I really am fascinated
by exactly that and like,

4633
01:50:40,740 --> 01:50:41,110
you know,

4634
01:50:41,110 --> 01:50:42,040
sensory deprivation tanks.

4635
01:50:42,041 --> 01:50:42,461
It's just funny.

4636
01:50:42,461 --> 01:50:43,250
Like,

4637
01:50:43,250 --> 01:50:43,720
we're,

4638
01:50:43,720 --> 01:50:45,070
we're so vulnerable,

4639
01:50:45,071 --> 01:50:50,071
we're such vulnerable little creatures
and it's so unbelievable that we move

4640
01:50:51,551 --> 01:50:54,250
around the world and live
around the world where we do,

4641
01:50:54,310 --> 01:50:55,300
how we do,

4642
01:50:55,690 --> 01:50:55,931
you know,

4643
01:50:55,931 --> 01:50:57,430
Louis C K as that great thing about,

4644
01:50:57,431 --> 01:50:57,791
you know,

4645
01:50:57,791 --> 01:50:58,210
uh,

4646
01:50:58,210 --> 01:51:00,850
people complaining about the Wifi not
working on the flight and he's like,

4647
01:51:00,851 --> 01:51:03,490
you're being thrown through
the sky in a chair and come on.

4648
01:51:03,910 --> 01:51:04,271
And,

4649
01:51:04,271 --> 01:51:04,660
uh,

4650
01:51:04,660 --> 01:51:06,340
and that's totally how
I feel about everything.

4651
01:51:06,370 --> 01:51:07,203
Like when I look at,

4652
01:51:07,210 --> 01:51:08,043
you know,

4653
01:51:08,170 --> 01:51:08,680
uh,

4654
01:51:08,680 --> 01:51:09,670
airbags,

4655
01:51:09,690 --> 01:51:10,090
you know,

4656
01:51:10,090 --> 01:51:10,540
sure.

4657
01:51:10,540 --> 01:51:10,811
Safety,

4658
01:51:10,811 --> 01:51:14,140
restraint systems like
pressurization on plans,

4659
01:51:14,141 --> 01:51:14,891
all that stuff.

4660
01:51:14,891 --> 01:51:15,910
It's unbelievable.

4661
01:51:15,970 --> 01:51:16,560
So,

4662
01:51:16,560 --> 01:51:16,900
yeah.

4663
01:51:16,900 --> 01:51:17,051
Yeah.

4664
01:51:17,051 --> 01:51:21,840
What I meant though is the actual effects
on the mind or sensory deprivation,

4665
01:51:21,870 --> 01:51:22,150
right.

4666
01:51:22,150 --> 01:51:22,351
You,

4667
01:51:22,351 --> 01:51:22,720
you know,

4668
01:51:22,720 --> 01:51:23,890
you'd never experienced that at all.

4669
01:51:23,950 --> 01:51:24,311
I haven't,

4670
01:51:24,311 --> 01:51:25,600
I haven't gone in and done a tank.

4671
01:51:25,640 --> 01:51:26,320
No.

4672
01:51:26,320 --> 01:51:26,681
Why not?

4673
01:51:26,681 --> 01:51:27,251
I've never done it.

4674
01:51:27,251 --> 01:51:27,370
No,

4675
01:51:27,370 --> 01:51:28,360
I just haven't had the opportunity.

4676
01:51:28,361 --> 01:51:28,930
I'd love to.

4677
01:51:28,930 --> 01:51:29,763
It sounds great.

4678
01:51:30,150 --> 01:51:30,983
You're leaving soon.

4679
01:51:31,030 --> 01:51:32,470
Otherwise I would just
suggest a place here,

4680
01:51:32,471 --> 01:51:33,490
but in northern California,

4681
01:51:33,491 --> 01:51:36,130
there's a gang of places you
go to and I'm sure Twitter,

4682
01:51:36,131 --> 01:51:36,431
Twitter,

4683
01:51:36,431 --> 01:51:37,264
people attack.

4684
01:51:37,390 --> 01:51:38,440
Go send them some links.

4685
01:51:38,720 --> 01:51:39,460
Um,

4686
01:51:39,460 --> 01:51:40,091
you got to try it.

4687
01:51:40,091 --> 01:51:41,890
If you were fascinated by the human mind,

4688
01:51:41,891 --> 01:51:43,380
you really need to try that state.

4689
01:51:43,381 --> 01:51:43,690
Cool.

4690
01:51:43,690 --> 01:51:45,420
Cause it's not available
anywhere else in the world.

4691
01:51:45,450 --> 01:51:46,480
How would you describe it if you have it?

4692
01:51:46,690 --> 01:51:47,051
Oh yeah.

4693
01:51:47,051 --> 01:51:47,884
I have one in my house.

4694
01:51:48,520 --> 01:51:50,950
I do it almost every week.

4695
01:51:50,951 --> 01:51:51,131
You know,

4696
01:51:51,131 --> 01:51:52,150
I had many times all week.

4697
01:51:52,180 --> 01:51:52,331
Yeah.

4698
01:51:52,331 --> 01:51:52,811
What's it like?

4699
01:51:52,811 --> 01:51:53,200
What does the,

4700
01:51:53,200 --> 01:51:53,770
what's the effect?

4701
01:51:53,770 --> 01:51:54,700
Well there's no,

4702
01:51:54,820 --> 01:51:56,180
there's no census coming in.

4703
01:51:56,181 --> 01:51:58,060
I mean even having this conversation,

4704
01:51:58,090 --> 01:51:59,830
there's no distractions
but every now and then,

4705
01:51:59,831 --> 01:52:00,041
you know,

4706
01:52:00,041 --> 01:52:02,460
you hear that truck goes
by or next door or your,

4707
01:52:02,461 --> 01:52:03,294
you feel you're,

4708
01:52:03,410 --> 01:52:06,100
you have to shift your butt cause
you know it gets uncomfortable.

4709
01:52:06,340 --> 01:52:07,870
All that input,

4710
01:52:08,050 --> 01:52:08,883
all that's input.

4711
01:52:09,130 --> 01:52:10,000
When you're in a tank,

4712
01:52:10,001 --> 01:52:10,834
there's nothing,

4713
01:52:10,930 --> 01:52:13,570
there's no input and much like
we're having this conversation.

4714
01:52:13,571 --> 01:52:14,470
If a truck goes by,

4715
01:52:14,471 --> 01:52:15,820
it's a slight distraction.

4716
01:52:15,850 --> 01:52:18,460
If you're trying to formulate words
and that truck was really loud,

4717
01:52:18,540 --> 01:52:20,890
it will be annoying because you
have to deal with that input.

4718
01:52:20,891 --> 01:52:21,724
You have to deal with that.

4719
01:52:21,730 --> 01:52:24,640
That information is coming towards
you when you're inside the tank.

4720
01:52:24,670 --> 01:52:25,241
It really is.

4721
01:52:25,241 --> 01:52:29,630
The only environment in the world where
you don't have your body talking to you,

4722
01:52:29,730 --> 01:52:29,920
right?

4723
01:52:29,920 --> 01:52:30,910
You're floating in water.

4724
01:52:30,911 --> 01:52:32,650
That's the same temperature as your skin.

4725
01:52:32,920 --> 01:52:34,960
There's a thousand pounds
of salt in that water,

4726
01:52:34,990 --> 01:52:35,621
Epsom salt.

4727
01:52:35,621 --> 01:52:37,090
So you float like you're,

4728
01:52:37,091 --> 01:52:38,170
you're completely buoyant,

4729
01:52:38,171 --> 01:52:41,920
and because your temperature of
the water is the same as your skin,

4730
01:52:42,130 --> 01:52:43,390
you don't feel it after a while,

4731
01:52:43,750 --> 01:52:45,820
you literally feel like
flying through space.

4732
01:52:45,850 --> 01:52:47,260
What does it do to the total darkness?

4733
01:52:47,260 --> 01:52:48,093
Your most silence?

4734
01:52:48,400 --> 01:52:48,611
Well,

4735
01:52:48,611 --> 01:52:50,800
your mind has no sensory input,

4736
01:52:50,801 --> 01:52:51,970
so there's no distractions.

4737
01:52:51,971 --> 01:52:53,320
So it's super powered.

4738
01:52:53,470 --> 01:52:54,303
It's ridic.

4739
01:52:54,310 --> 01:52:56,380
Just as your brain is compromised,

4740
01:52:56,381 --> 01:52:57,910
when there's a Jack Hammer next to you,

4741
01:52:58,240 --> 01:53:02,110
your brain becomes equally
magnified when there's nothing.

4742
01:53:02,170 --> 01:53:05,560
If I have any problems whatsoever of
these things that are bothering me,

4743
01:53:06,190 --> 01:53:08,770
I go in the tank and it's like
having a seminar on my life.

4744
01:53:08,800 --> 01:53:11,110
It's like all of a sudden I
could see things so much clearly.

4745
01:53:11,160 --> 01:53:11,890
Hmm.

4746
01:53:11,890 --> 01:53:12,790
And so much more clearly.

4747
01:53:12,791 --> 01:53:13,590
And you're,

4748
01:53:13,590 --> 01:53:16,150
you're completely outside of the world.

4749
01:53:16,210 --> 01:53:16,541
I mean,

4750
01:53:16,541 --> 01:53:17,770
you're not lying on a bed.

4751
01:53:17,771 --> 01:53:18,940
You're not in an osh rom.

4752
01:53:19,150 --> 01:53:21,340
You're not even in a human body anymore.

4753
01:53:21,900 --> 01:53:23,170
It's your consciousness,

4754
01:53:23,470 --> 01:53:26,830
literally untethered from the human body.

4755
01:53:26,860 --> 01:53:27,370
That's awesome.

4756
01:53:27,370 --> 01:53:27,611
Yeah,

4757
01:53:27,611 --> 01:53:28,444
you need to do it.

4758
01:53:29,020 --> 01:53:29,320
We'll,

4759
01:53:29,320 --> 01:53:29,710
I'm in,

4760
01:53:29,710 --> 01:53:30,101
I'm in.

4761
01:53:30,101 --> 01:53:30,880
That sounds great.

4762
01:53:30,880 --> 01:53:35,620
I didn't invent this fucking thing and
I can't believe that I tell so many

4763
01:53:35,621 --> 01:53:36,640
people about it and they're like,

4764
01:53:36,641 --> 01:53:37,210
wow,

4765
01:53:37,210 --> 01:53:38,080
I need to do that.

4766
01:53:38,080 --> 01:53:38,291
I'm like,

4767
01:53:38,291 --> 01:53:38,681
Jesus,

4768
01:53:38,681 --> 01:53:42,130
this is 2013 why the fuck are
these things not everywhere.

4769
01:53:42,370 --> 01:53:44,530
There's so incredibly beneficial.

4770
01:53:44,710 --> 01:53:48,730
And they give you a lot of the benefits
of psychedelic drugs without any of the

4771
01:53:48,731 --> 01:53:51,490
worries about tripping
out and losing your mind.

4772
01:53:51,491 --> 01:53:52,091
And you know,

4773
01:53:52,091 --> 01:53:55,870
a lot of people know someone that's lost
their marbles on Lsd or something or

4774
01:53:55,871 --> 01:53:57,910
had a bad emotional
experience on mushrooms.

4775
01:53:58,180 --> 01:54:03,180
And so when they think about the idea
of taking a drug to detach from the

4776
01:54:03,550 --> 01:54:04,061
reality,

4777
01:54:04,061 --> 01:54:05,260
to gain a fresh perspective,

4778
01:54:05,261 --> 01:54:06,250
it's terrifying.

4779
01:54:06,550 --> 01:54:08,550
But you can achieve
psychedelic states and in,

4780
01:54:08,551 --> 01:54:10,960
in a sensory deprivation
tank with no worries at all.

4781
01:54:10,990 --> 01:54:11,321
Totally.

4782
01:54:11,321 --> 01:54:11,551
I,

4783
01:54:11,551 --> 01:54:12,071
I will.

4784
01:54:12,071 --> 01:54:12,761
I will try it out.

4785
01:54:12,761 --> 01:54:13,810
I've never done it that on it.

4786
01:54:13,811 --> 01:54:15,150
So we're just that Sherman's,

4787
01:54:15,170 --> 01:54:16,003
it's better.

4788
01:54:16,970 --> 01:54:17,501
You don't even know.

4789
01:54:17,501 --> 01:54:18,221
You don't even try it.

4790
01:54:18,221 --> 01:54:19,054
An isolation tank.

4791
01:54:19,500 --> 01:54:20,333
How are you talking about?

4792
01:54:20,640 --> 01:54:21,070
It's,

4793
01:54:21,070 --> 01:54:22,180
it doesn't beat my mushrooms.

4794
01:54:22,390 --> 01:54:23,170
You don't know that.

4795
01:54:23,170 --> 01:54:24,003
You don't know anything.

4796
01:54:25,270 --> 01:54:27,170
So you're saying isolates
and taking Pete's terms.

4797
01:54:27,280 --> 01:54:28,840
I'm saying it's the
same sort of experience.

4798
01:54:29,230 --> 01:54:32,800
You can have the same experience that you
can have on a heavy duty mushroom trip

4799
01:54:32,830 --> 01:54:33,730
in an isolation tank.

4800
01:54:33,760 --> 01:54:35,080
And by the way,

4801
01:54:35,230 --> 01:54:40,230
a mushroom trip in an isolation tank
is a thousand times more intense way we

4802
01:54:40,470 --> 01:54:40,641
eat.

4803
01:54:40,641 --> 01:54:41,560
Is Mark for you?

4804
01:54:41,800 --> 01:54:42,660
Self examined me.

4805
01:54:42,790 --> 01:54:43,870
That's the last thing you want.

4806
01:54:44,440 --> 01:54:44,860
Um,

4807
01:54:44,860 --> 01:54:45,670
it's,

4808
01:54:45,670 --> 01:54:46,331
it's a,

4809
01:54:46,331 --> 01:54:51,331
it's just a incredibly unique environment
that I'm shocked isn't available at

4810
01:54:51,820 --> 01:54:52,990
major universities.

4811
01:54:53,230 --> 01:54:54,190
I think it should be everywhere.

4812
01:54:54,191 --> 01:54:55,660
I think people should have that.

4813
01:54:56,140 --> 01:54:57,010
I mean it should be,

4814
01:54:57,280 --> 01:55:01,030
you can go anywhere and you find a
yoga studio and try find her sensory

4815
01:55:01,070 --> 01:55:01,903
deprivation.

4816
01:55:02,140 --> 01:55:04,210
Reason Joe is that a lot of
people it doesn't work on,

4817
01:55:04,540 --> 01:55:05,220
that's not,

4818
01:55:05,220 --> 01:55:06,011
that's not the reason.

4819
01:55:06,011 --> 01:55:06,380
Brian,

4820
01:55:06,380 --> 01:55:09,010
I reason why it's not available
is not because a lot of people,

4821
01:55:09,011 --> 01:55:09,820
it doesn't work on.

4822
01:55:09,820 --> 01:55:10,031
No,

4823
01:55:10,031 --> 01:55:13,690
I mean that's why it's nice popular
because a lot of people do the isolation

4824
01:55:13,691 --> 01:55:14,950
tank and it does nothing for them.

4825
01:55:14,951 --> 01:55:16,510
So why would they go back to doing,

4826
01:55:16,540 --> 01:55:17,380
what are you basing this on?

4827
01:55:17,530 --> 01:55:20,860
I know several people that have come up
to me and talked to me about isolation

4828
01:55:20,861 --> 01:55:23,410
tanks because they've heard it
on this podcast and they've,

4829
01:55:23,440 --> 01:55:23,860
they were like,

4830
01:55:23,860 --> 01:55:24,820
I've done it three times.

4831
01:55:24,860 --> 01:55:26,470
It's nothing to me.

4832
01:55:26,471 --> 01:55:27,340
It's just kind of boring.

4833
01:55:27,341 --> 01:55:29,000
I just sit there and
that's happened to me,

4834
01:55:29,420 --> 01:55:30,190
at least for you.

4835
01:55:30,190 --> 01:55:31,780
These are the people that
are desperate to talk to you.

4836
01:55:34,030 --> 01:55:35,200
They have limited resources.

4837
01:55:35,510 --> 01:55:36,343
The right,

4838
01:55:36,580 --> 01:55:38,800
I'm telling you because I
fucking have one in my basement.

4839
01:55:38,890 --> 01:55:39,890
I,

4840
01:55:41,440 --> 01:55:43,890
you just need to learn how
to let go and concentrate.

4841
01:55:43,891 --> 01:55:47,310
It's not like it's an
immediate jolt into hyperspace,

4842
01:55:47,640 --> 01:55:48,480
but what it is,

4843
01:55:48,481 --> 01:55:49,530
is the,

4844
01:55:49,560 --> 01:55:50,220
uh,

4845
01:55:50,220 --> 01:55:55,220
an environment where you can truly be
away from the influence on full body.

4846
01:55:56,010 --> 01:55:59,100
And if you're on any sort of substance,

4847
01:55:59,130 --> 01:56:00,270
any psychedelic or anything,

4848
01:56:00,271 --> 01:56:03,390
it's magically enhanced inside the tank.

4849
01:56:03,840 --> 01:56:07,470
You eat a cookie and get an isolation
tank and tell me that's not a trippy

4850
01:56:07,471 --> 01:56:07,921
experience.

4851
01:56:07,921 --> 01:56:08,311
I'll tell you,

4852
01:56:08,311 --> 01:56:09,144
you're crazy.

4853
01:56:09,450 --> 01:56:10,283
It's,

4854
01:56:10,320 --> 01:56:11,011
it's,

4855
01:56:11,011 --> 01:56:12,900
it's so beneficial.

4856
01:56:13,460 --> 01:56:14,670
There's a couple of issues.

4857
01:56:14,671 --> 01:56:15,504
One,

4858
01:56:15,510 --> 01:56:16,680
most people who do it,

4859
01:56:17,100 --> 01:56:20,040
they don't do it enough to get
truly relaxed in that environment.

4860
01:56:20,041 --> 01:56:24,180
Because a lot of the sensory deprivation
tank experience is about letting go.

4861
01:56:24,180 --> 01:56:27,330
It's about learning how to relax
and learning how to let go,

4862
01:56:27,331 --> 01:56:31,560
and not concentrating on the fact that
you're in a tank and not bumping up

4863
01:56:31,561 --> 01:56:32,610
against the walls.

4864
01:56:32,670 --> 01:56:37,350
You got to get good at it and you got to
get good at the whole letting go thing.

4865
01:56:37,590 --> 01:56:38,520
It's not easy.

4866
01:56:38,521 --> 01:56:39,750
It's just like meditation.

4867
01:56:39,751 --> 01:56:41,490
It's a difficult thing to do,

4868
01:56:41,730 --> 01:56:45,660
but you can achieve some pretty
powerful states in meditation.

4869
01:56:46,260 --> 01:56:49,860
You can achieve much more powerful
states if you're meditating inside of an

4870
01:56:49,861 --> 01:56:50,650
isolation tank.

4871
01:56:50,650 --> 01:56:51,210
Hmm.

4872
01:56:51,210 --> 01:56:54,390
I just want her to know if you knew
anything about the actual effects of the

4873
01:56:54,391 --> 01:56:54,841
mind.

4874
01:56:54,841 --> 01:56:56,550
Do you remember that movie
altered states when they do,

4875
01:56:56,551 --> 01:56:59,840
was wired up with all these electrodes
and they were monitoring his mine lives

4876
01:56:59,850 --> 01:57:00,683
in there.

4877
01:57:00,900 --> 01:57:01,590
I haven't seen it.

4878
01:57:01,590 --> 01:57:02,460
You haven't seen altered states?

4879
01:57:03,110 --> 01:57:04,740
What was all based on John Lilly?

4880
01:57:04,990 --> 01:57:05,370
Um,

4881
01:57:05,370 --> 01:57:06,031
who was,

4882
01:57:06,031 --> 01:57:06,240
uh,

4883
01:57:06,240 --> 01:57:06,670
by the way,

4884
01:57:06,670 --> 01:57:09,060
used to take acid and talked to dolphins.

4885
01:57:09,090 --> 01:57:09,923
That was his thing.

4886
01:57:10,290 --> 01:57:13,080
Pioneer an interspecies communication and,

4887
01:57:13,081 --> 01:57:13,351
uh,

4888
01:57:13,351 --> 01:57:13,950
Lilly,

4889
01:57:13,950 --> 01:57:14,220
uh,

4890
01:57:14,220 --> 01:57:18,180
would get an isolation tank and a set
it up right next to a tank filled with

4891
01:57:18,181 --> 01:57:22,680
dolphins and the hop in the isolation
tank and trip his balls off and have this

4892
01:57:22,681 --> 01:57:23,191
experience.

4893
01:57:23,191 --> 01:57:25,590
But He created the
sensory deprivation tank.

4894
01:57:25,980 --> 01:57:27,480
There was a couple of
different versions of it.

4895
01:57:27,481 --> 01:57:27,991
The first one,

4896
01:57:27,991 --> 01:57:30,870
he was a vertical with sort of like
a space helmet on for his heir.

4897
01:57:31,080 --> 01:57:34,170
And he would like float
based on this tank.

4898
01:57:34,480 --> 01:57:36,450
Like he would kind of be
floating from his head.

4899
01:57:36,890 --> 01:57:37,490
Yeah.

4900
01:57:37,490 --> 01:57:39,300
And then the second one,

4901
01:57:39,330 --> 01:57:40,170
he figured out,

4902
01:57:40,200 --> 01:57:40,950
okay,

4903
01:57:40,950 --> 01:57:43,530
if you live vertically and
fill the tank with salt,

4904
01:57:43,531 --> 01:57:44,340
you'll float.

4905
01:57:44,340 --> 01:57:45,360
So he,

4906
01:57:45,420 --> 01:57:47,190
he even rigged it up so that he could,

4907
01:57:47,520 --> 01:57:51,960
he had like a tube that was collecting
waste and sucking waste out of it.

4908
01:57:51,961 --> 01:57:54,220
So he spent a long time there.

4909
01:57:54,910 --> 01:57:55,140
Well,

4910
01:57:55,140 --> 01:57:58,860
lily was also famous for
his love of ketamine,

4911
01:57:59,130 --> 01:58:00,030
so he would,

4912
01:58:00,031 --> 01:58:00,420
uh,

4913
01:58:00,420 --> 01:58:04,710
take ketamine and go on these a six
hour Kay hold trips inside this tank.

4914
01:58:04,711 --> 01:58:06,420
And if you gotta take a leak,

4915
01:58:06,450 --> 01:58:07,283
you know,

4916
01:58:07,650 --> 01:58:08,670
just pulls it out of you.

4917
01:58:09,320 --> 01:58:10,153
Yeah,

4918
01:58:10,390 --> 01:58:12,430
I was peeking hard during these,

4919
01:58:12,460 --> 01:58:12,730
uh,

4920
01:58:12,730 --> 01:58:13,750
this mushroom trip though.

4921
01:58:13,780 --> 01:58:14,530
Like I ate,

4922
01:58:14,530 --> 01:58:15,760
I just ate a cap.

4923
01:58:15,761 --> 01:58:19,270
I just went into a little and I started
like to the point where my hands were

4924
01:58:19,271 --> 01:58:23,350
melting and I had to go into
this water and it was intense.

4925
01:58:23,380 --> 01:58:24,213
Like sure.

4926
01:58:24,640 --> 01:58:27,250
I was like trying to like talk
to the dolphin with my mind,

4927
01:58:27,251 --> 01:58:30,520
like staring at in its eyes
and stuff and it didn't go,

4928
01:58:30,830 --> 01:58:31,840
it wouldn't have pretty good.

4929
01:58:31,841 --> 01:58:33,070
I mean it was pretty ridiculous.

4930
01:58:33,071 --> 01:58:33,420
But the,

4931
01:58:33,420 --> 01:58:36,550
the crazy thing is that the
dolphin racked me twice,

4932
01:58:36,640 --> 01:58:40,810
didn't hit anybody else and then at the
end busted me on the lip with its tail.

4933
01:58:41,020 --> 01:58:41,561
You got lucky.

4934
01:58:41,561 --> 01:58:42,730
Two dolphins are strong.

4935
01:58:43,210 --> 01:58:44,050
It was like,

4936
01:58:44,130 --> 01:58:45,070
so what are you thinking of?

4937
01:58:45,071 --> 01:58:46,960
The Dolphin was like hearing your cries.

4938
01:58:47,040 --> 01:58:48,910
I wanted to beat the shit out
of you cause you were annoying.

4939
01:58:48,940 --> 01:58:49,840
I have no idea.

4940
01:58:49,841 --> 01:58:52,420
And the only other thing I can think
of is I was at the end of the line.

4941
01:58:52,421 --> 01:58:52,841
So when,

4942
01:58:52,841 --> 01:58:53,141
when,

4943
01:58:53,141 --> 01:58:53,951
when they were like,

4944
01:58:53,951 --> 01:58:54,131
all right,

4945
01:58:54,131 --> 01:58:55,390
we're going to flip the dolphin over.

4946
01:58:55,391 --> 01:58:55,911
Everyone pet it.

4947
01:58:55,911 --> 01:58:56,411
Stomach.

4948
01:58:56,411 --> 01:58:56,561
Well,

4949
01:58:56,561 --> 01:58:58,210
I was petting the vagina the whole time,

4950
01:58:58,211 --> 01:58:59,044
didn't even know it,

4951
01:58:59,380 --> 01:58:59,950
and then she,

4952
01:58:59,950 --> 01:59:00,281
she's like,

4953
01:59:00,281 --> 01:59:00,641
see that's,

4954
01:59:00,641 --> 01:59:03,710
this is the vagina and there's a slit
on each side of the vagina that the

4955
01:59:03,730 --> 01:59:04,690
dolphin feeds out of.

4956
01:59:04,691 --> 01:59:04,991
I'm like,

4957
01:59:04,991 --> 01:59:05,261
Whoa,

4958
01:59:05,261 --> 01:59:06,040
I'm touching it.

4959
01:59:06,040 --> 01:59:06,790
Like,

4960
01:59:06,790 --> 01:59:07,840
like she is.

4961
01:59:07,910 --> 01:59:08,770
What do you mean you didn't know?

4962
01:59:08,771 --> 01:59:09,740
You've told me about that.

4963
01:59:09,741 --> 01:59:10,690
And that was true.

4964
01:59:10,691 --> 01:59:11,320
Mean Dude,

4965
01:59:11,320 --> 01:59:16,210
I was like touch item that's in front
of you didn't even know what it looked

4966
01:59:16,211 --> 01:59:16,420
like.

4967
01:59:16,420 --> 01:59:17,081
I mean,

4968
01:59:17,081 --> 01:59:17,980
at the time I was just like,

4969
01:59:17,981 --> 01:59:18,251
wow,

4970
01:59:18,251 --> 01:59:18,761
it's soft.

4971
01:59:18,761 --> 01:59:19,331
It's awesome.

4972
01:59:19,331 --> 01:59:20,610
But then did you get to right you,

4973
01:59:20,620 --> 01:59:20,900
you,

4974
01:59:20,900 --> 01:59:21,650
you did this before,

4975
01:59:21,650 --> 01:59:22,390
right?

4976
01:59:22,390 --> 01:59:22,950
Oh I'm,

4977
01:59:22,950 --> 01:59:23,181
I'm,

4978
01:59:23,181 --> 01:59:25,070
I'm really against dolphin captivity.

4979
01:59:25,110 --> 01:59:26,510
I think it's really fucked up.

4980
01:59:26,540 --> 01:59:31,070
I think the idea of taking
a superintelligent animal
like a dolphin and putting

4981
01:59:31,071 --> 01:59:34,790
in a swimming pool and having a bunch
of people touch it is just like taking a

4982
01:59:34,791 --> 01:59:38,330
person and putting them in a fucking
box and having a bunch of fish come and

4983
01:59:38,331 --> 01:59:38,871
stare at you.

4984
01:59:38,871 --> 01:59:39,511
I think it's ridic.

4985
01:59:39,511 --> 01:59:39,650
Yeah,

4986
01:59:39,650 --> 01:59:43,950
they do eat like crazy and they seemed
all very happy and dolphins are the only

4987
01:59:43,951 --> 01:59:44,850
ones that you know,

4988
01:59:45,180 --> 01:59:46,230
if they don't like life,

4989
01:59:46,231 --> 01:59:49,140
they just stopped breeding like
they're there voluntarily breathing.

4990
01:59:49,170 --> 01:59:49,471
They're,

4991
01:59:49,471 --> 01:59:51,630
they're the only species
that voluntarily breeze.

4992
01:59:51,870 --> 01:59:55,080
And so like that's why a lot of times
when dolphins will just commit suicide if

4993
01:59:55,081 --> 01:59:58,230
they're unhappy and they would all
commit suicide if they were unhappy,

4994
01:59:58,231 --> 01:59:59,064
wouldn't they?

4995
01:59:59,840 --> 02:00:00,530
I mean it's,

4996
02:00:00,530 --> 02:00:02,930
you're saying that their
life has to be so horrible,

4997
02:00:02,960 --> 02:00:03,800
the commit suicide.

4998
02:00:03,801 --> 02:00:06,350
There's a lot of people that are
ridiculously unhappy in prison that aren't

4999
02:00:06,351 --> 02:00:07,091
committing suicide.

5000
02:00:07,091 --> 02:00:09,740
It doesn't mean the prison
is awesome by that logic.

5001
02:00:09,741 --> 02:00:10,440
That doesn't mean

5002
02:00:10,440 --> 02:00:13,670
wouldn't there be some dolphins that
killed themselves to then if they were

5003
02:00:13,671 --> 02:00:14,000
unhappy?

5004
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:14,590
I mean they just have,

5005
02:00:14,590 --> 02:00:17,800
do you know anybody just got home fed
the whole time I was watching them?

5006
02:00:18,510 --> 02:00:18,690
No,

5007
02:00:18,690 --> 02:00:19,050
man,

5008
02:00:19,050 --> 02:00:19,801
they have no freedom.

5009
02:00:19,801 --> 02:00:20,281
Not only that,

5010
02:00:20,281 --> 02:00:21,620
they steal them from their mothers.

5011
02:00:21,690 --> 02:00:24,270
The killer whales are
very famous for that.

5012
02:00:24,450 --> 02:00:25,380
And killer whales,

5013
02:00:25,381 --> 02:00:25,861
by the way,

5014
02:00:25,861 --> 02:00:27,390
the only incidents of killer whales,

5015
02:00:27,400 --> 02:00:28,650
they'll ever murdering people.

5016
02:00:28,651 --> 02:00:30,000
It's been in captivity.

5017
02:00:30,240 --> 02:00:31,073
They hate it.

5018
02:00:31,080 --> 02:00:31,913
They don't want that.

5019
02:00:32,540 --> 02:00:33,590
Dolphins have killer whales.

5020
02:00:33,630 --> 02:00:36,030
There were dolphins are just
cousins of killer whales.

5021
02:00:36,360 --> 02:00:38,310
I just think it's a fucked up a replica.

5022
02:00:38,400 --> 02:00:41,700
It's a remnant of the past where
we didn't understand these animals.

5023
02:00:41,701 --> 02:00:42,630
These are super,

5024
02:00:42,631 --> 02:00:46,530
super intelligent animals and just like
the cove is fucked up cause it's fucked

5025
02:00:46,531 --> 02:00:47,251
up to murder them.

5026
02:00:47,251 --> 02:00:48,960
It's fucked up to imprison them too.

5027
02:00:49,140 --> 02:00:52,410
It's not like these were bad dolphins and
we had to remove them from the dolphin

5028
02:00:52,411 --> 02:00:53,250
population,

5029
02:00:53,760 --> 02:00:56,640
which dolphins by the way are fucking bad.

5030
02:00:56,641 --> 02:00:57,840
They do a lot of crazy shit.

5031
02:00:57,841 --> 02:00:58,500
They rape,

5032
02:00:58,500 --> 02:00:59,850
they kill babies.

5033
02:00:59,851 --> 02:01:02,130
I mean they don't just
because they're intelligent,

5034
02:01:02,131 --> 02:01:05,070
they don't fall by the morals and the
ethics that human beings would like to

5035
02:01:05,071 --> 02:01:07,080
think of flipper having right now.

5036
02:01:07,120 --> 02:01:08,610
Dolphins do some dirty shit.

5037
02:01:08,640 --> 02:01:08,791
We,

5038
02:01:08,791 --> 02:01:13,791
the story coming up in a couple of issues
about by this Guy Brian Lam who runs a

5039
02:01:14,860 --> 02:01:15,960
thing called the wire cutters.

5040
02:01:15,961 --> 02:01:16,261
Cool guy.

5041
02:01:16,261 --> 02:01:16,531
But I mean,

5042
02:01:16,531 --> 02:01:16,671
he,

5043
02:01:16,671 --> 02:01:16,861
he,

5044
02:01:16,861 --> 02:01:21,570
he's a good writer and did a story
for us about a basically going,

5045
02:01:21,600 --> 02:01:24,900
and I'm tagging along with this kind of,

5046
02:01:25,380 --> 02:01:26,460
not quite rank tank crew,

5047
02:01:26,461 --> 02:01:26,760
but like,

5048
02:01:26,760 --> 02:01:26,950
you know,

5049
02:01:26,950 --> 02:01:27,631
crew scientists,

5050
02:01:27,631 --> 02:01:31,350
but they there by their nature are
a little crazy and that they're out,

5051
02:01:31,470 --> 02:01:32,220
um,

5052
02:01:32,220 --> 02:01:32,730
uh,

5053
02:01:32,730 --> 02:01:34,620
hand tagging sharks.

5054
02:01:35,160 --> 02:01:36,120
They'd get them up on the boat,

5055
02:01:36,121 --> 02:01:36,450
you know,

5056
02:01:36,450 --> 02:01:37,620
like dangerous,

5057
02:01:37,621 --> 02:01:38,454
you know,

5058
02:01:38,460 --> 02:01:39,950
hammerheads know the whole deal.

5059
02:01:39,951 --> 02:01:40,130
And

5060
02:01:40,130 --> 02:01:44,540
they tagged them with these very
improved tanks that are far more

5061
02:01:44,541 --> 02:01:45,980
technologically Fisker
than what we have now.

5062
02:01:45,981 --> 02:01:48,950
And as a result of giving us all this
new data about sharks and what they do

5063
02:01:49,460 --> 02:01:50,390
with it live with,

5064
02:01:50,420 --> 02:01:50,661
you know,

5065
02:01:50,661 --> 02:01:51,530
how deep they go,

5066
02:01:51,531 --> 02:01:52,364
all this stuff.

5067
02:01:52,530 --> 02:01:52,821
Um,

5068
02:01:52,821 --> 02:01:54,140
but he was describing what it's like to,

5069
02:01:54,141 --> 02:01:57,930
in the story he describes what it's like
to try and get to be in the water with

5070
02:01:57,940 --> 02:02:00,740
a shark and how incredibly scary that is.

5071
02:02:00,770 --> 02:02:03,050
Like those things are
just built for death.

5072
02:02:03,080 --> 02:02:03,680
They are,

5073
02:02:03,680 --> 02:02:04,160
you know,

5074
02:02:04,160 --> 02:02:05,630
the nature's perfect weapon.

5075
02:02:05,631 --> 02:02:06,080
Those things.

5076
02:02:06,080 --> 02:02:06,441
Yeah,

5077
02:02:06,441 --> 02:02:08,150
that must be absolutely horrifying.

5078
02:02:08,200 --> 02:02:08,720
Um,

5079
02:02:08,720 --> 02:02:09,740
one of the things,

5080
02:02:09,770 --> 02:02:14,690
one of the reasons why I'm so adamant
about the dolphin thing was that I had a

5081
02:02:14,691 --> 02:02:16,370
psychedelic experience with dolphins,

5082
02:02:16,371 --> 02:02:18,230
two of them eating pot and being on a,

5083
02:02:18,270 --> 02:02:19,103
a boat.

5084
02:02:19,280 --> 02:02:19,781
And that's that,

5085
02:02:19,781 --> 02:02:21,770
that bit that I do a store that I wrote,

5086
02:02:22,370 --> 02:02:23,000
I,

5087
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:26,690
these dolphins were playing with us
and they were jumping next to us by the

5088
02:02:26,691 --> 02:02:26,960
boat.

5089
02:02:26,960 --> 02:02:27,171
And they're,

5090
02:02:27,171 --> 02:02:27,351
they're,

5091
02:02:27,351 --> 02:02:30,860
they're really playful and they're
really obviously intelligent.

5092
02:02:30,890 --> 02:02:32,600
Like they don't fall for the hooks.

5093
02:02:32,601 --> 02:02:33,770
They're not biting our bait.

5094
02:02:34,100 --> 02:02:34,610
You know,

5095
02:02:34,610 --> 02:02:34,851
we're,

5096
02:02:34,851 --> 02:02:36,230
we're fishing and we're not,

5097
02:02:36,290 --> 02:02:38,210
they don't worry about it at all.

5098
02:02:38,240 --> 02:02:38,511
Like,

5099
02:02:38,511 --> 02:02:40,160
no one catches a dolphin on a hook.

5100
02:02:40,190 --> 02:02:41,030
It's just doesn't happen.

5101
02:02:41,360 --> 02:02:43,040
The only way you catch
them is by netting them.

5102
02:02:43,041 --> 02:02:43,310
Like,

5103
02:02:43,310 --> 02:02:43,550
you know,

5104
02:02:43,550 --> 02:02:44,900
corralling them in where they're fucked.

5105
02:02:45,290 --> 02:02:47,950
But you don't hear about
dolphins falling for a fake worm.

5106
02:02:48,140 --> 02:02:48,441
You know,

5107
02:02:48,441 --> 02:02:49,160
it doesn't happen.

5108
02:02:49,160 --> 02:02:50,810
I've always liked the people who say,

5109
02:02:50,811 --> 02:02:50,991
you know,

5110
02:02:50,991 --> 02:02:51,420
people who've,

5111
02:02:51,420 --> 02:02:52,790
who've spent time with them sometimes say,

5112
02:02:52,791 --> 02:02:53,270
you know,

5113
02:02:53,270 --> 02:02:53,541
man,

5114
02:02:53,541 --> 02:02:53,720
it's,

5115
02:02:53,720 --> 02:02:56,240
it seems almost as if they've
evolved past where we are.

5116
02:02:56,300 --> 02:02:56,511
You know,

5117
02:02:56,511 --> 02:02:58,280
like they shed their possessions.

5118
02:02:58,470 --> 02:03:00,770
We don't have the ability
to change their environment,

5119
02:03:00,800 --> 02:03:05,030
but other than that they have an amazing
ability to communicate and they have a

5120
02:03:05,031 --> 02:03:05,660
nice environment.

5121
02:03:05,660 --> 02:03:06,410
Have you seen it?

5122
02:03:06,410 --> 02:03:07,280
Have you seen their ears,

5123
02:03:07,281 --> 02:03:07,610
Joe?

5124
02:03:07,610 --> 02:03:09,450
It's like a higher technology than us.

5125
02:03:09,500 --> 02:03:10,460
It's a pinhole.

5126
02:03:10,490 --> 02:03:11,900
It's just a little dot.

5127
02:03:12,050 --> 02:03:16,400
And they're also born with mustaches
when they're young and like you could see

5128
02:03:16,401 --> 02:03:20,110
the holes when they're older where the
mustache used to be on their lip and

5129
02:03:20,120 --> 02:03:20,721
there's a bad ass.

5130
02:03:20,721 --> 02:03:21,830
They were born with mustaches.

5131
02:03:22,010 --> 02:03:23,540
I wonder what purpose it serves.

5132
02:03:23,750 --> 02:03:24,380
No.

5133
02:03:24,380 --> 02:03:26,860
Evolutionary fresh looking,

5134
02:03:26,870 --> 02:03:27,710
fresh little.

5135
02:03:27,760 --> 02:03:28,860
A nice little pimp,

5136
02:03:28,880 --> 02:03:29,890
thin stash.

5137
02:03:30,020 --> 02:03:30,860
Like I think it is too.

5138
02:03:30,861 --> 02:03:32,690
And I think it is a pin stripe,

5139
02:03:32,870 --> 02:03:36,890
like one of those Eddie Murphy ones
where it's just a tiny line of hair above

5140
02:03:36,891 --> 02:03:37,724
the lip.

5141
02:03:38,210 --> 02:03:38,540
Yeah,

5142
02:03:38,540 --> 02:03:39,373
I dunno,

5143
02:03:39,560 --> 02:03:40,140
I just,

5144
02:03:40,140 --> 02:03:40,870
I,

5145
02:03:40,870 --> 02:03:42,990
I think it's cool that
you did that and you know,

5146
02:03:43,050 --> 02:03:43,550
I mean they're,

5147
02:03:43,550 --> 02:03:47,090
they're going to be in that seaworld
placed whether you go there or not,

5148
02:03:47,091 --> 02:03:48,170
but I don't want to go there.

5149
02:03:48,560 --> 02:03:50,630
I've been to the zoo
high and I don't like it.

5150
02:03:51,040 --> 02:03:51,530
You know,

5151
02:03:51,530 --> 02:03:53,900
I wrote this whole thing
when I went to the zoo about,

5152
02:03:54,110 --> 02:03:55,550
it's like this animal prison.

5153
02:03:55,730 --> 02:03:58,340
You see these primates
screaming in their cage.

5154
02:03:58,910 --> 02:04:01,040
I was at a zoo once
and this is one monkey.

5155
02:04:01,041 --> 02:04:02,210
I don't remember what monkey was,

5156
02:04:02,300 --> 02:04:03,960
but it was by itself and its little cage.

5157
02:04:03,961 --> 02:04:06,980
It was smaller than this room and
this fucking thing was screaming.

5158
02:04:07,250 --> 02:04:07,821
And I was like,

5159
02:04:07,821 --> 02:04:09,380
that is madness.

5160
02:04:09,590 --> 02:04:14,590
That's an intelligent animal that someone
has decided to make it stay in this

5161
02:04:14,661 --> 02:04:16,820
one spot and it's going insane.

5162
02:04:16,880 --> 02:04:17,990
Screaming.

5163
02:04:18,400 --> 02:04:18,520
What,

5164
02:04:18,520 --> 02:04:22,000
what seemed like that to me was the
ship moves or that the killer whales and

5165
02:04:22,150 --> 02:04:22,870
that to me,

5166
02:04:22,870 --> 02:04:23,620
like I didn't think that,

5167
02:04:23,620 --> 02:04:25,690
I thought the dolphins looked like
they were all having a great time.

5168
02:04:25,900 --> 02:04:26,230
But,

5169
02:04:26,230 --> 02:04:26,900
uh,

5170
02:04:26,900 --> 02:04:31,870
the killer whales looked that was kind
of fucked up cause it was just a huge

5171
02:04:31,871 --> 02:04:34,300
tank and they just were
swimming in circles,

5172
02:04:34,301 --> 02:04:35,290
not stop.

5173
02:04:35,291 --> 02:04:36,280
That's all they did.

5174
02:04:36,880 --> 02:04:37,160
They,

5175
02:04:37,160 --> 02:04:37,993
yeah,

5176
02:04:38,130 --> 02:04:38,461
that,

5177
02:04:38,461 --> 02:04:39,300
that was awful.

5178
02:04:39,420 --> 02:04:39,810
But,

5179
02:04:39,810 --> 02:04:41,430
but I thought the
shampoos were pretty cool.

5180
02:04:42,120 --> 02:04:42,953
You know what?

5181
02:04:43,190 --> 02:04:44,150
It's all physical.

5182
02:04:44,280 --> 02:04:45,960
You know what I think
it's called about boa.

5183
02:04:45,990 --> 02:04:46,711
Is that what it's called?

5184
02:04:46,711 --> 02:04:46,831
Where?

5185
02:04:46,831 --> 02:04:47,790
It's like a dolphin,

5186
02:04:47,791 --> 02:04:52,110
but it's white and it's got a
huge like crazy mushroom head.

5187
02:04:52,230 --> 02:04:53,240
Oh I know what you're
talking to him about.

5188
02:04:53,241 --> 02:04:53,391
Nine.

5189
02:04:53,391 --> 02:04:54,090
So type of,

5190
02:04:54,090 --> 02:04:55,140
it's a type of dolphin.

5191
02:04:55,150 --> 02:04:55,371
Yeah,

5192
02:04:55,371 --> 02:04:56,130
it's a white,

5193
02:04:56,130 --> 02:04:57,900
I think it's actually a type of whale.

5194
02:04:58,380 --> 02:04:59,190
It's a,

5195
02:04:59,190 --> 02:04:59,551
yeah,

5196
02:04:59,551 --> 02:05:00,384
I know what you're talking about.

5197
02:05:00,460 --> 02:05:03,810
They will know the name of it opening up
next month where you can hang out with

5198
02:05:03,811 --> 02:05:06,990
those guys and that Shit looks bad
ass cause it looks like star wars.

5199
02:05:08,200 --> 02:05:09,310
This is how they should do it.

5200
02:05:09,340 --> 02:05:11,650
If they really want to have
a relationship with dolphins,

5201
02:05:11,651 --> 02:05:14,980
they should give them food and put up
a center in a place where the dolphins

5202
02:05:14,981 --> 02:05:17,080
live naturally and put
people in submarines.

5203
02:05:17,410 --> 02:05:20,590
But the idea that you know you should
put them in a fucking fish tank,

5204
02:05:20,591 --> 02:05:21,191
and by the way,

5205
02:05:21,191 --> 02:05:23,470
that water's probably chlorinated how else

5206
02:05:23,510 --> 02:05:24,230
they're going to have it.

5207
02:05:24,230 --> 02:05:25,130
It was salt water.

5208
02:05:25,190 --> 02:05:25,741
It was salty.

5209
02:05:25,741 --> 02:05:27,890
Tastes like Saltwater and Oh,

5210
02:05:27,891 --> 02:05:28,724
okay,

5211
02:05:28,880 --> 02:05:30,150
that makes sense actually because

5212
02:05:30,610 --> 02:05:32,150
I have a saltwater pool like you,

5213
02:05:32,210 --> 02:05:33,490
you know you can have,

5214
02:05:33,520 --> 02:05:34,890
you can get away with that without those.

5215
02:05:34,970 --> 02:05:37,420
The same principle of the isolation tank,

5216
02:05:37,421 --> 02:05:38,201
not getting funky.

5217
02:05:38,201 --> 02:05:39,880
Nothing really can grow in the salt water.

5218
02:05:39,881 --> 02:05:40,660
Right.

5219
02:05:40,660 --> 02:05:42,720
But I just think we don't
need to do that anymore,

5220
02:05:42,740 --> 02:05:43,270
man.

5221
02:05:43,270 --> 02:05:43,940
It's just a,

5222
02:05:43,940 --> 02:05:44,773
even zoos,

5223
02:05:44,780 --> 02:05:44,981
I mean,

5224
02:05:44,981 --> 02:05:47,620
I take my kids to the zoo
because the zoo is there.

5225
02:05:47,621 --> 02:05:49,810
And for them it's fascinating
and they go crazy.

5226
02:05:49,811 --> 02:05:51,070
But it was up to me.

5227
02:05:51,071 --> 02:05:52,030
We wouldn't have zoos.

5228
02:05:52,060 --> 02:05:54,970
It's just seems crazy to
have a prison for gorillas.

5229
02:05:54,971 --> 02:05:56,830
They're staring at you and they're fucked.

5230
02:05:57,310 --> 02:05:58,000
You know,

5231
02:05:58,000 --> 02:05:59,200
just the whole thing is,

5232
02:05:59,230 --> 02:05:59,471
it's,

5233
02:05:59,471 --> 02:06:00,790
it's a relic I think.

5234
02:06:01,240 --> 02:06:01,510
Yeah,

5235
02:06:01,510 --> 02:06:01,661
no,

5236
02:06:01,661 --> 02:06:02,080
it's true.

5237
02:06:02,080 --> 02:06:02,360
I,

5238
02:06:02,360 --> 02:06:02,651
you know,

5239
02:06:02,651 --> 02:06:02,831
the,

5240
02:06:02,831 --> 02:06:03,520
the,

5241
02:06:03,520 --> 02:06:04,630
it's funny when you go,

5242
02:06:04,930 --> 02:06:07,480
there's the American Museum of Natural
History in New York has this whole wing

5243
02:06:07,481 --> 02:06:09,190
of it's stuff that it inherited of like,

5244
02:06:09,790 --> 02:06:10,623
um,

5245
02:06:10,740 --> 02:06:11,050
you know,

5246
02:06:11,050 --> 02:06:13,000
stuffed animals.

5247
02:06:13,060 --> 02:06:13,511
And,

5248
02:06:13,511 --> 02:06:13,811
uh,

5249
02:06:13,811 --> 02:06:14,021
I,

5250
02:06:14,021 --> 02:06:14,854
you know,

5251
02:06:15,080 --> 02:06:16,480
I'd love the Americans are not state.

5252
02:06:16,530 --> 02:06:17,470
I think they do amazing work,

5253
02:06:17,471 --> 02:06:17,800
you know,

5254
02:06:17,800 --> 02:06:18,633
but the,

5255
02:06:18,880 --> 02:06:19,480
um,

5256
02:06:19,480 --> 02:06:19,751
you know,

5257
02:06:19,751 --> 02:06:21,610
it's just funny to go and
stand in front of like,

5258
02:06:21,611 --> 02:06:25,600
what was the zoo back in the 19th century,

5259
02:06:25,601 --> 02:06:26,171
18th century.

5260
02:06:26,171 --> 02:06:27,004
The desire to,

5261
02:06:27,430 --> 02:06:27,940
to,

5262
02:06:27,940 --> 02:06:28,420
uh,

5263
02:06:28,420 --> 02:06:28,601
you know,

5264
02:06:28,601 --> 02:06:30,130
shoot and stuff and animals.

5265
02:06:30,160 --> 02:06:31,390
How about African men?

5266
02:06:32,130 --> 02:06:32,550
Well,

5267
02:06:32,550 --> 02:06:33,160
there was there,

5268
02:06:33,160 --> 02:06:37,080
there's been a exhibits at zoos
before where they had black men.

5269
02:06:37,081 --> 02:06:38,250
I think they had pygmies.

5270
02:06:38,260 --> 02:06:39,570
It's zoos before,

5271
02:06:39,610 --> 02:06:40,320
Huh?

5272
02:06:40,320 --> 02:06:40,681
Yeah.

5273
02:06:40,681 --> 02:06:42,180
I mean they've uh,

5274
02:06:42,410 --> 02:06:43,060
the,

5275
02:06:43,060 --> 02:06:47,790
the ability to justify the
imprisonment of an intelligent animal.

5276
02:06:48,300 --> 02:06:52,500
It's really weird when we start and think
about what an intelligent species from

5277
02:06:52,501 --> 02:06:56,400
another planet would do to us if
they came here and found out that Kim

5278
02:06:56,400 --> 02:06:58,230
Kardashian was the most
famous woman on the planet.

5279
02:06:58,560 --> 02:07:01,350
What is to say that they want
these dumb mother fuckers,

5280
02:07:01,351 --> 02:07:03,930
let's just lock them up in
a cage and give him food.

5281
02:07:03,931 --> 02:07:04,621
As long as they have food,

5282
02:07:04,621 --> 02:07:05,140
they'll be happy.

5283
02:07:05,140 --> 02:07:05,471
There are,

5284
02:07:05,471 --> 02:07:05,761
I mean,

5285
02:07:05,761 --> 02:07:06,220
the,

5286
02:07:06,220 --> 02:07:06,821
on the other hand though,

5287
02:07:06,821 --> 02:07:08,020
I would point out that there's like,

5288
02:07:08,050 --> 02:07:08,883
you know,

5289
02:07:09,220 --> 02:07:10,360
there is some,

5290
02:07:10,420 --> 02:07:14,410
at least some understanding
of what animals need to
thrive in an environment and

5291
02:07:14,730 --> 02:07:15,281
just do,

5292
02:07:15,281 --> 02:07:16,061
do a great job.

5293
02:07:16,061 --> 02:07:19,360
We're trying to do a great job in the
way of creating environments where the

5294
02:07:19,720 --> 02:07:20,500
animal is,

5295
02:07:20,500 --> 02:07:21,333
you know,

5296
02:07:21,340 --> 02:07:22,900
maybe trick is one way to put it,

5297
02:07:22,901 --> 02:07:23,734
but like you know,

5298
02:07:24,030 --> 02:07:24,291
is,

5299
02:07:24,291 --> 02:07:24,910
is,

5300
02:07:24,910 --> 02:07:28,630
feels comfortable in the environment
and there's all kinds of crazy optical

5301
02:07:28,631 --> 02:07:29,800
illusions at the Seattle Zoo.

5302
02:07:29,801 --> 02:07:30,430
There's a,

5303
02:07:30,430 --> 02:07:32,350
the Savannah kind of curves,

5304
02:07:32,351 --> 02:07:33,250
it's almost like you're,

5305
02:07:33,251 --> 02:07:35,230
you're on the top of the dome sort of,

5306
02:07:35,231 --> 02:07:36,130
but it's a very gradual dumb,

5307
02:07:36,430 --> 02:07:41,430
but it's enough that for a long time it
looks as if there's a long horizon out

5308
02:07:41,741 --> 02:07:42,574
in front of you.

5309
02:07:42,690 --> 02:07:43,030
Uh,

5310
02:07:43,030 --> 02:07:44,190
it blocks out the background that's,

5311
02:07:44,191 --> 02:07:44,440
no,

5312
02:07:44,440 --> 02:07:45,700
you're not seeing a
trees in the background,

5313
02:07:45,701 --> 02:07:45,911
whatever,

5314
02:07:45,911 --> 02:07:47,560
because it's sloped up just slightly.

5315
02:07:47,980 --> 02:07:48,640
And you know,

5316
02:07:48,640 --> 02:07:49,421
I wonder if that's,

5317
02:07:49,421 --> 02:07:49,871
I don't know.

5318
02:07:49,871 --> 02:07:52,570
But I imagine that that's
like designed to make,

5319
02:07:52,990 --> 02:07:53,201
you know,

5320
02:07:53,201 --> 02:07:57,220
to keep a lion's eyes sharp or whatever
the thing is that they're trying to do.

5321
02:07:57,370 --> 02:07:57,760
Well,

5322
02:07:57,760 --> 02:07:59,380
if they really want it
to be nice to the line,

5323
02:07:59,381 --> 02:08:00,560
they like goats Lewis.

5324
02:08:01,090 --> 02:08:04,270
They would also look at growth
there like they do in Asia.

5325
02:08:04,570 --> 02:08:04,960
You know,

5326
02:08:04,960 --> 02:08:05,501
in Asia,

5327
02:08:05,501 --> 02:08:06,730
the way they treat tigers,

5328
02:08:06,870 --> 02:08:07,240
they,

5329
02:08:07,240 --> 02:08:11,700
it's really not sporting whatsoever
because they back a truck up and they,

5330
02:08:11,730 --> 02:08:14,830
they lift up the fork lift in the
back of the truck or whatever the,

5331
02:08:14,831 --> 02:08:14,921
uh,

5332
02:08:14,921 --> 02:08:17,530
the cab in the back of the
truck and the goat falls out.

5333
02:08:17,530 --> 02:08:18,820
The Tigers just tear it apart.

5334
02:08:18,850 --> 02:08:19,150
Wow.

5335
02:08:19,150 --> 02:08:20,010
Have you ever seen that before?

5336
02:08:20,020 --> 02:08:20,151
No,

5337
02:08:20,151 --> 02:08:20,730
I haven't.

5338
02:08:20,730 --> 02:08:21,670
Cue the video.

5339
02:08:22,460 --> 02:08:23,710
It's the,

5340
02:08:23,711 --> 02:08:24,220
um,

5341
02:08:24,220 --> 02:08:24,851
there's a,

5342
02:08:24,851 --> 02:08:28,600
also a zoo in Iraq and that's one of
the first videos I ever saw about it on

5343
02:08:28,601 --> 02:08:29,800
online where they,

5344
02:08:29,801 --> 02:08:30,070
uh,

5345
02:08:30,070 --> 02:08:34,450
they released a goat and these lions came
running out and rip the goat apart in

5346
02:08:34,451 --> 02:08:35,051
front of all these,

5347
02:08:35,051 --> 02:08:37,210
a gis that were there with cell phones.

5348
02:08:37,211 --> 02:08:37,840
Well,

5349
02:08:37,840 --> 02:08:38,350
yeah,

5350
02:08:38,350 --> 02:08:38,681
it's,

5351
02:08:38,681 --> 02:08:39,370
um,

5352
02:08:39,370 --> 02:08:41,590
at least that's normal.

5353
02:08:42,250 --> 02:08:43,031
That's what they do.

5354
02:08:43,031 --> 02:08:43,330
That's right.

5355
02:08:43,330 --> 02:08:48,300
The idea of sliding a tray under
the cage with some cold meat.

5356
02:08:48,760 --> 02:08:49,560
Yeah.

5357
02:08:49,560 --> 02:08:52,630
The whole reward system
that an animal has,

5358
02:08:52,700 --> 02:08:54,180
especially these predators,

5359
02:08:54,190 --> 02:08:58,360
their entire reward system is based
on chasing and catching things.

5360
02:08:58,420 --> 02:08:58,960
Right.

5361
02:08:58,960 --> 02:09:01,240
I mean if you roll a
ball in front of a cat,

5362
02:09:01,270 --> 02:09:03,880
it's going to go after it
and it's because it's got,

5363
02:09:04,420 --> 02:09:05,110
and they say the,

5364
02:09:05,110 --> 02:09:08,860
one of the big things about mountain
lion attacks as they attack joggers a lot

5365
02:09:09,280 --> 02:09:10,630
cause they think you're
trying to get away,

5366
02:09:10,730 --> 02:09:11,040
right,

5367
02:09:11,040 --> 02:09:11,680
right.

5368
02:09:11,680 --> 02:09:13,610
Thing they tell you about a pickup,

5369
02:09:13,780 --> 02:09:14,860
any small children,

5370
02:09:15,300 --> 02:09:15,640
uh,

5371
02:09:15,640 --> 02:09:16,480
in order to,

5372
02:09:16,481 --> 02:09:16,680
uh,

5373
02:09:16,680 --> 02:09:17,260
uh,

5374
02:09:17,260 --> 02:09:21,730
because of mountain lions instinct is
to go after the smallest one and little

5375
02:09:21,731 --> 02:09:24,010
kids or are prone to running away.

5376
02:09:24,400 --> 02:09:27,340
And that is what turns on the instinct,

5377
02:09:27,341 --> 02:09:30,730
the prey drive so that you have to pick
up your kid if you see a mountain lion.

5378
02:09:31,030 --> 02:09:32,710
Well and coyotes as well,

5379
02:09:32,711 --> 02:09:33,070
you know,

5380
02:09:33,070 --> 02:09:34,360
there was a big bear,

5381
02:09:34,361 --> 02:09:34,810
um,

5382
02:09:34,810 --> 02:09:37,990
last year there was an attack of five
year old was attacked by a coyote right in

5383
02:09:37,991 --> 02:09:38,710
front of his father.

5384
02:09:38,710 --> 02:09:39,380
Oh Wow.

5385
02:09:39,380 --> 02:09:41,170
And the coyote tackled
the kid and just tried to,

5386
02:09:41,320 --> 02:09:42,400
tried to fucking eat them.

5387
02:09:42,780 --> 02:09:43,540
No,

5388
02:09:43,540 --> 02:09:44,110
man.

5389
02:09:44,110 --> 02:09:44,800
Yeah.

5390
02:09:44,800 --> 02:09:46,000
As a father I would be,

5391
02:09:46,001 --> 02:09:46,770
I'd freak out.

5392
02:09:46,770 --> 02:09:46,950
Yeah.

5393
02:09:46,950 --> 02:09:50,020
So here they dropped this thing out and
they just grab a hold of it and just

5394
02:09:50,021 --> 02:09:51,100
start pulling it apart.

5395
02:09:51,130 --> 02:09:51,910
Wow.

5396
02:09:51,910 --> 02:09:52,370
What is that?

5397
02:09:52,370 --> 02:09:52,570
Uh,

5398
02:09:52,570 --> 02:09:53,291
as it is,

5399
02:09:53,291 --> 02:09:58,291
it beef some sort of a sheep or a
goat or something like that and these,

5400
02:09:59,051 --> 02:09:59,560
uh,

5401
02:09:59,560 --> 02:10:00,320
this is lying.

5402
02:10:00,320 --> 02:10:01,330
So those things are strong.

5403
02:10:01,570 --> 02:10:01,871
Yeah.

5404
02:10:01,871 --> 02:10:04,060
The lion's take a little
more time than the Tigers.

5405
02:10:04,330 --> 02:10:07,570
The Tigers grab ahold of it and
it's almost instantly a wrap.

5406
02:10:07,660 --> 02:10:09,700
They just yank them and rip on Florence.

5407
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:12,430
But it means if you're going
to have animals like that,

5408
02:10:12,431 --> 02:10:14,440
it seems kind of fucked
up to have them in a,

5409
02:10:14,441 --> 02:10:17,290
in a place where they can't run
around and they don't have any chase.

5410
02:10:17,570 --> 02:10:17,890
Right,

5411
02:10:17,890 --> 02:10:18,240
right.

5412
02:10:18,240 --> 02:10:19,790
Their whole reason to live.

5413
02:10:19,900 --> 02:10:20,800
That's what they were involved.

5414
02:10:20,801 --> 02:10:22,090
All these incredible abilities,

5415
02:10:22,091 --> 02:10:22,220
right.

5416
02:10:22,220 --> 02:10:24,460
Th the teeth and the
pre drove the eyesight,

5417
02:10:24,461 --> 02:10:24,911
all that stuff.

5418
02:10:24,911 --> 02:10:26,320
And you do need to keep that right.

5419
02:10:26,660 --> 02:10:29,980
Sharp vegans who feed
their dogs Vegan dog food,

5420
02:10:30,010 --> 02:10:30,310
like,

5421
02:10:30,310 --> 02:10:30,551
Oh,

5422
02:10:30,551 --> 02:10:31,690
you fuck,

5423
02:10:31,720 --> 02:10:32,800
how dare you?

5424
02:10:33,210 --> 02:10:33,840
Like,

5425
02:10:33,840 --> 02:10:36,660
you know that dogs barely
surviving on that shit,

5426
02:10:36,870 --> 02:10:37,231
by the way.

5427
02:10:37,231 --> 02:10:38,960
I was talking about a
Beluga whale earlier.

5428
02:10:38,990 --> 02:10:39,220
Ah,

5429
02:10:39,220 --> 02:10:39,411
yeah.

5430
02:10:39,411 --> 02:10:40,070
That's it.

5431
02:10:40,070 --> 02:10:42,010
Are they as smart as
a dolphin or anything?

5432
02:10:42,040 --> 02:10:42,190
Oh,

5433
02:10:42,190 --> 02:10:43,023
that's a good question.

5434
02:10:43,110 --> 02:10:44,220
I think it's the same family.

5435
02:10:44,221 --> 02:10:44,550
I mean they're,

5436
02:10:44,550 --> 02:10:45,383
they're definitely the,

5437
02:10:45,440 --> 02:10:46,090
the,

5438
02:10:46,090 --> 02:10:46,650
you know,

5439
02:10:46,650 --> 02:10:47,341
it's that family.

5440
02:10:47,341 --> 02:10:47,940
Yeah.

5441
02:10:47,940 --> 02:10:48,331
Yeah.

5442
02:10:48,331 --> 02:10:49,620
I think there's a whole gang,

5443
02:10:49,621 --> 02:10:52,290
a smart marine animals,

5444
02:10:52,320 --> 02:10:53,153
you know,

5445
02:10:53,210 --> 02:10:54,780
and we're willing to in prison,

5446
02:10:54,781 --> 02:10:55,230
all of them

5447
02:10:55,230 --> 02:10:55,981
let's really awesome.

5448
02:10:55,981 --> 02:10:56,360
Amazing.

5449
02:10:56,360 --> 02:10:57,630
It's seeing the sting rays,

5450
02:10:57,631 --> 02:11:00,450
they have this whole thing where it's
just this pool where you can touch and

5451
02:11:00,451 --> 02:11:04,380
feed sting rays and these sting rays would
just come up out of the pool and they

5452
02:11:04,381 --> 02:11:07,770
look like little dogs that
instead of having feet have like,

5453
02:11:07,771 --> 02:11:08,041
you know,

5454
02:11:08,041 --> 02:11:08,390
like,

5455
02:11:08,390 --> 02:11:09,840
like wings on those.

5456
02:11:09,870 --> 02:11:11,630
It was really amazing because
they're so domesticated.

5457
02:11:11,710 --> 02:11:12,290
Yeah,

5458
02:11:12,290 --> 02:11:12,780
yeah,

5459
02:11:12,780 --> 02:11:12,961
yeah.

5460
02:11:12,961 --> 02:11:13,351
I've fed him.

5461
02:11:13,351 --> 02:11:16,140
In Hawaii there's a tank and
at the big island where you,

5462
02:11:16,141 --> 02:11:16,261
uh,

5463
02:11:16,261 --> 02:11:17,094
you swim with them,

5464
02:11:17,390 --> 02:11:21,630
he put a snorkel on swim with the sting
rays and all these other fish and fish

5465
02:11:21,631 --> 02:11:22,560
poop by the way.

5466
02:11:22,650 --> 02:11:23,483
Everywhere you look,

5467
02:11:23,930 --> 02:11:25,080
it's not even a tank actually.

5468
02:11:25,081 --> 02:11:25,491
It's like a Gel,

5469
02:11:25,491 --> 02:11:29,490
like a big pond and they'll allow you
to feed them and little kids feed them.

5470
02:11:29,491 --> 02:11:32,030
They hold food out like scallops
and stuff in their hands and the,

5471
02:11:32,310 --> 02:11:33,420
the stingers come up and they,

5472
02:11:33,421 --> 02:11:36,540
they're crazy miles and they just
suck it right out of your hand.

5473
02:11:36,700 --> 02:11:37,160
Uh,

5474
02:11:37,160 --> 02:11:38,360
series C row.

5475
02:11:38,361 --> 02:11:39,194
It's bad ass though.

5476
02:11:39,230 --> 02:11:40,063
That's all I have to say.

5477
02:11:40,180 --> 02:11:40,840
Yeah,

5478
02:11:40,840 --> 02:11:41,621
I agree.

5479
02:11:41,621 --> 02:11:43,210
I mean it is bad ass,

5480
02:11:43,300 --> 02:11:44,133
but are you,

5481
02:11:44,180 --> 02:11:46,150
I can't agree with it morally.

5482
02:11:46,240 --> 02:11:47,073
I just think,

5483
02:11:47,200 --> 02:11:51,310
I think they're intelligent and I think
we have to sort of draw some sort of a

5484
02:11:51,311 --> 02:11:53,980
line as to how we deal
with intelligent beings.

5485
02:11:54,310 --> 02:11:55,540
Our attitude is like,

5486
02:11:55,660 --> 02:11:56,493
what are you saying?

5487
02:11:57,490 --> 02:11:58,390
I can't understand you.

5488
02:11:58,600 --> 02:11:59,530
Do you want a fish?

5489
02:11:59,620 --> 02:12:00,850
Then you have to do the trick.

5490
02:12:01,360 --> 02:12:02,193
You know,

5491
02:12:02,550 --> 02:12:03,670
it's kind of fucked up.

5492
02:12:03,770 --> 02:12:05,810
I had a friend who was a trainer,

5493
02:12:05,840 --> 02:12:06,321
I don't know where,

5494
02:12:06,321 --> 02:12:07,610
where it was somewhere in Hawaii.

5495
02:12:07,611 --> 02:12:08,760
He was trained to dolphins or he,

5496
02:12:08,770 --> 02:12:09,620
he was a graduate student.

5497
02:12:09,621 --> 02:12:10,454
I was doing this work.

5498
02:12:10,480 --> 02:12:10,820
And,

5499
02:12:10,820 --> 02:12:11,653
um,

5500
02:12:11,810 --> 02:12:12,980
he said that by the end of it,

5501
02:12:12,981 --> 02:12:17,210
the dolphins had trained
him that basically like he
was only getting to the pool

5502
02:12:17,211 --> 02:12:20,180
when he was like they would behave a
certain way to get him to behave a certain

5503
02:12:20,181 --> 02:12:23,930
way is how he just wound up one day
realizing that not disagreeing with you in

5504
02:12:23,931 --> 02:12:25,610
any way but it is nuts that they're just,

5505
02:12:25,611 --> 02:12:26,480
they're really,

5506
02:12:26,540 --> 02:12:27,350
really intelligent.

5507
02:12:27,350 --> 02:12:27,830
Yeah,

5508
02:12:27,830 --> 02:12:28,371
I'm sure.

5509
02:12:28,371 --> 02:12:28,880
I mean they're,

5510
02:12:28,880 --> 02:12:32,450
they're trying to express something and
if he's paying attention he's going to

5511
02:12:32,510 --> 02:12:33,440
sort of catch on and,

5512
02:12:33,441 --> 02:12:34,090
and move with it.

5513
02:12:34,090 --> 02:12:34,320
Dumb.

5514
02:12:34,320 --> 02:12:34,890
They would do that.

5515
02:12:34,890 --> 02:12:38,700
They would do the trick too to get him
to give them the treat but then they

5516
02:12:38,701 --> 02:12:40,770
would withhold the trick
and then do it really well.

5517
02:12:40,771 --> 02:12:44,130
They would do like they'd mess with them
and essentially ended like train him to

5518
02:12:44,131 --> 02:12:45,090
just deliver the fish.

5519
02:12:45,440 --> 02:12:47,970
If I could live comfortably and
not have to worry about money,

5520
02:12:48,120 --> 02:12:51,270
I would just take care of dolphins for my,

5521
02:12:51,300 --> 02:12:52,133
for my job.

5522
02:12:52,140 --> 02:12:53,010
I that's how,

5523
02:12:53,130 --> 02:12:54,720
how attached to that,

5524
02:12:54,870 --> 02:12:56,160
that experience to me wise,

5525
02:12:56,161 --> 02:12:58,910
it was just that there's
something with dolphins there.

5526
02:12:58,930 --> 02:12:59,790
I haven't been found out.

5527
02:12:59,791 --> 02:13:00,030
Yeah,

5528
02:13:00,030 --> 02:13:01,050
they're amazing.

5529
02:13:01,720 --> 02:13:02,800
And it hasn't been found out.

5530
02:13:02,801 --> 02:13:03,041
It's just,

5531
02:13:03,041 --> 02:13:04,120
we can't understand them.

5532
02:13:04,140 --> 02:13:04,430
They,

5533
02:13:04,430 --> 02:13:05,740
they're very intelligent.

5534
02:13:05,770 --> 02:13:06,700
They're cerebral cortex.

5535
02:13:06,701 --> 02:13:08,410
It's 40% larger than a human beings.

5536
02:13:08,890 --> 02:13:09,221
And,

5537
02:13:09,221 --> 02:13:09,640
um,

5538
02:13:09,640 --> 02:13:10,420
I mean I,

5539
02:13:10,420 --> 02:13:10,691
that,

5540
02:13:10,691 --> 02:13:14,440
that experience that I had when I
was in the boat in Hawaii with those,

5541
02:13:14,441 --> 02:13:15,160
uh,

5542
02:13:15,160 --> 02:13:17,470
wild dolphins playing that was a,

5543
02:13:17,471 --> 02:13:21,610
it seemed very tangible to me and it
changed the way I look at human beings.

5544
02:13:21,611 --> 02:13:23,560
It changed the way I look
at consciousness in general.

5545
02:13:23,580 --> 02:13:27,110
I started thinking that
their consciousness is
probably quite a bit like a

5546
02:13:27,111 --> 02:13:28,000
human's consciousness.

5547
02:13:28,001 --> 02:13:30,400
They just can't alter
their environment there.

5548
02:13:30,401 --> 02:13:30,641
They,

5549
02:13:30,641 --> 02:13:32,770
we can't them and they can
alter their environment,

5550
02:13:32,771 --> 02:13:35,110
but they seem like if you,

5551
02:13:35,150 --> 02:13:35,360
uh,

5552
02:13:35,360 --> 02:13:36,310
encountered,

5553
02:13:36,670 --> 02:13:37,130
I mean we,

5554
02:13:37,130 --> 02:13:37,440
we,

5555
02:13:37,440 --> 02:13:41,020
we take for granted the fact that the
way they move is very much like a fish.

5556
02:13:41,080 --> 02:13:44,590
So we sort of categorize them sort of how
you were talking about trucks earlier.

5557
02:13:44,590 --> 02:13:44,770
Like,

5558
02:13:44,770 --> 02:13:44,951
oh,

5559
02:13:44,951 --> 02:13:45,640
that's a truck.

5560
02:13:45,640 --> 02:13:46,090
Oh,

5561
02:13:46,090 --> 02:13:46,930
that's a dolphin.

5562
02:13:47,250 --> 02:13:49,330
Their method of locomotion is one thing.

5563
02:13:49,331 --> 02:13:52,060
But if you met a dolphin in space,

5564
02:13:52,270 --> 02:13:57,270
if it was like something like that where
it had that sort of intelligence and it

5565
02:13:57,671 --> 02:14:00,760
was communicating and moving
around more like a human,

5566
02:14:00,761 --> 02:14:01,100
if it had,

5567
02:14:01,100 --> 02:14:02,740
it was bipedal and it was,

5568
02:14:02,741 --> 02:14:03,070
but it,

5569
02:14:03,070 --> 02:14:03,401
but it,

5570
02:14:03,401 --> 02:14:06,190
you looked at it and made
noise and interacted with you,

5571
02:14:06,400 --> 02:14:08,050
you would freak the fuck out dude.

5572
02:14:08,051 --> 02:14:08,470
Run.

5573
02:14:08,470 --> 02:14:08,681
Yeah.

5574
02:14:08,681 --> 02:14:09,700
Well you would just freak out.

5575
02:14:09,701 --> 02:14:13,390
You'd be so flabbergasted that you're
dealing with this alien intelligence.

5576
02:14:13,391 --> 02:14:14,260
It's just like you,

5577
02:14:14,710 --> 02:14:18,940
it's dolphins exist in this world where
they can move through three dimensional

5578
02:14:18,941 --> 02:14:19,361
space,

5579
02:14:19,361 --> 02:14:23,380
so they don't need to be able to touch
things with fingers and all manipulation.

5580
02:14:23,410 --> 02:14:24,820
There's all kinds of studies about,

5581
02:14:24,821 --> 02:14:25,390
um,

5582
02:14:25,390 --> 02:14:26,130
uh,

5583
02:14:26,130 --> 02:14:26,510
you know,

5584
02:14:26,510 --> 02:14:26,980
the,

5585
02:14:26,980 --> 02:14:27,671
the inner life,

5586
02:14:27,671 --> 02:14:29,110
the emotional life of animals.

5587
02:14:29,111 --> 02:14:29,800
You know,

5588
02:14:29,800 --> 02:14:31,330
elephants that bury their dead,

5589
02:14:31,331 --> 02:14:32,530
grieve for their dead.

5590
02:14:32,710 --> 02:14:35,020
Elephants can recognize
themselves in the mirror,

5591
02:14:35,050 --> 02:14:37,000
know who they are and like
all that stuff is amazing.

5592
02:14:37,040 --> 02:14:38,080
They'll do paint themselves.

5593
02:14:38,081 --> 02:14:38,790
Yeah,

5594
02:14:38,790 --> 02:14:39,140
yeah,

5595
02:14:39,140 --> 02:14:39,560
yeah.

5596
02:14:39,560 --> 02:14:40,390
That's a trip.

5597
02:14:40,390 --> 02:14:40,851
That's a man.

5598
02:14:40,851 --> 02:14:44,230
You see the elephant painting
an elephant with his nose.

5599
02:14:44,880 --> 02:14:46,750
And grief is a big one that we like.

5600
02:14:46,751 --> 02:14:48,220
When we look back at the evolution of,

5601
02:14:48,221 --> 02:14:49,054
of uh,

5602
02:14:49,390 --> 02:14:49,720
uh,

5603
02:14:49,720 --> 02:14:50,380
people,

5604
02:14:50,380 --> 02:14:52,930
one of the great turning
points in evolution is,

5605
02:14:53,330 --> 02:14:53,890
um,

5606
02:14:53,890 --> 02:14:58,120
when we began burying our dead and the
idea that we began having these sort of,

5607
02:14:58,270 --> 02:14:59,103
you know,

5608
02:14:59,170 --> 02:15:00,430
a scientist would say,

5609
02:15:00,431 --> 02:15:01,264
you know,

5610
02:15:01,270 --> 02:15:01,961
sort of imagine,

5611
02:15:01,961 --> 02:15:02,170
you know,

5612
02:15:02,170 --> 02:15:04,210
inner lives and imaginary life almost,

5613
02:15:04,211 --> 02:15:04,331
right?

5614
02:15:04,331 --> 02:15:06,370
We just develop an
abstract sense of death.

5615
02:15:06,640 --> 02:15:08,740
That's when we become sophisticated.

5616
02:15:08,800 --> 02:15:09,101
You know,

5617
02:15:09,101 --> 02:15:09,934
that's when our brains,

5618
02:15:10,050 --> 02:15:11,860
meaning brains begin to really do it.

5619
02:15:11,890 --> 02:15:15,130
That's one of the things that trips me
out the most about Ray Kurtzweil is that

5620
02:15:15,131 --> 02:15:18,310
he believes he will be able to transcend
death and we'll be able to download

5621
02:15:18,311 --> 02:15:23,311
content onto a computer and
it takes 100,000 pills a
day and watches his diet in

5622
02:15:24,431 --> 02:15:27,790
order to extend his life to that
point where he gets to do that.

5623
02:15:27,880 --> 02:15:28,271
Yeah,

5624
02:15:28,271 --> 02:15:29,740
that's a very,

5625
02:15:29,950 --> 02:15:31,030
I wonder if I would opt for that.

5626
02:15:31,031 --> 02:15:31,271
You know,

5627
02:15:31,271 --> 02:15:34,000
like I find myself thinking about
like how I would want to go given like

5628
02:15:34,030 --> 02:15:35,320
infinite technological stuff.

5629
02:15:35,321 --> 02:15:36,640
I would want to go out on top.

5630
02:15:36,700 --> 02:15:38,110
I wouldn't want to let
you know what I mean.

5631
02:15:38,140 --> 02:15:39,430
Like you don't want to fade anymore.

5632
02:15:39,550 --> 02:15:43,480
You want all the medical research working
to make you think like you are playing

5633
02:15:43,481 --> 02:15:43,950
in,

5634
02:15:43,950 --> 02:15:44,350
you know,

5635
02:15:44,350 --> 02:15:44,831
game six,

5636
02:15:44,831 --> 02:15:45,460
the world series.

5637
02:15:45,460 --> 02:15:49,900
It's a real wrestling match between our
instincts and the reality that we're a

5638
02:15:49,901 --> 02:15:54,310
finite being and the reality that
we are also a part of a process.

5639
02:15:55,050 --> 02:15:57,210
One piece of a super organism,

5640
02:15:57,211 --> 02:15:59,070
which is the human race and,

5641
02:15:59,071 --> 02:16:00,420
but our ego tells us,

5642
02:16:00,421 --> 02:16:00,781
no,

5643
02:16:00,781 --> 02:16:01,650
I'm the most imply,

5644
02:16:01,651 --> 02:16:02,700
must survive.

5645
02:16:02,701 --> 02:16:03,241
I must,

5646
02:16:03,241 --> 02:16:04,140
I am important.

5647
02:16:04,141 --> 02:16:04,380
Yes,

5648
02:16:04,380 --> 02:16:04,681
it is.

5649
02:16:04,681 --> 02:16:05,270
I,

5650
02:16:05,270 --> 02:16:06,150
she was me,

5651
02:16:06,510 --> 02:16:06,990
you know,

5652
02:16:06,990 --> 02:16:07,590
it's the thing thing that

5653
02:16:07,590 --> 02:16:11,840
is always amazing to me about people who
can be so brave and reckless with their

5654
02:16:11,841 --> 02:16:12,591
bodies and so forth.

5655
02:16:12,591 --> 02:16:13,230
It's like they're,

5656
02:16:13,230 --> 02:16:14,390
they're getting there.

5657
02:16:14,480 --> 02:16:16,430
They're taking what you're
describing and sort of,

5658
02:16:16,930 --> 02:16:17,763
uh,

5659
02:16:17,780 --> 02:16:20,390
somehow of resisting it in a weird way.

5660
02:16:20,420 --> 02:16:23,150
Like your brain has evolved
to basically keep you alive,

5661
02:16:23,180 --> 02:16:24,320
keep you out of danger.

5662
02:16:24,350 --> 02:16:29,080
And the idea that people can sort of
voluntarily enter dangerous situations is,

5663
02:16:29,081 --> 02:16:29,914
to me an amazing

5664
02:16:30,010 --> 02:16:30,843
fighters are,

5665
02:16:30,970 --> 02:16:31,803
fighters are like,

5666
02:16:31,870 --> 02:16:32,140
you know,

5667
02:16:32,140 --> 02:16:33,310
I a suit people.

5668
02:16:33,440 --> 02:16:33,760
Yeah,

5669
02:16:33,760 --> 02:16:34,241
exactly.

5670
02:16:34,241 --> 02:16:34,631
Exactly.

5671
02:16:34,631 --> 02:16:38,290
Extreme athletes stuff is unbelievable
to me that I just think that's so,

5672
02:16:38,650 --> 02:16:39,130
you know,

5673
02:16:39,130 --> 02:16:42,730
it's amazing and thrilling and
wondrous and also scary as hell and,

5674
02:16:42,731 --> 02:16:46,060
and sort of nonsensical from
an evolutionary perspective,

5675
02:16:46,061 --> 02:16:49,300
like the idea that you would
voluntarily leap off a cliff.

5676
02:16:49,750 --> 02:16:49,961
You know,

5677
02:16:49,961 --> 02:16:54,961
you have to resist so many
millennia of programming to do that.

5678
02:16:55,150 --> 02:16:55,720
And you know,

5679
02:16:55,720 --> 02:16:57,050
it's nuts in a,

5680
02:16:57,250 --> 02:16:58,090
in a great way.

5681
02:16:58,091 --> 02:17:01,000
I guess we have the luxury of doing that.

5682
02:17:01,230 --> 02:17:05,020
And it's also that weird thing that we
do where we try to outdo each other and

5683
02:17:05,021 --> 02:17:06,610
who can do the wackiest craziest,

5684
02:17:06,611 --> 02:17:07,480
scariest shit.

5685
02:17:07,760 --> 02:17:09,250
And that's how these x games,

5686
02:17:09,251 --> 02:17:10,084
things like that.

5687
02:17:10,240 --> 02:17:12,130
They've had to like put
limits on people like say,

5688
02:17:12,131 --> 02:17:12,521
okay,

5689
02:17:12,521 --> 02:17:14,970
you can't do that any more
because someone just died trying,

5690
02:17:15,010 --> 02:17:18,670
like stop with the quadruple
flip off of the top of this ramp.

5691
02:17:18,980 --> 02:17:19,291
It can't,

5692
02:17:19,291 --> 02:17:20,050
you know,

5693
02:17:20,050 --> 02:17:24,040
it's not going to be done or it's going
to be done and 20% of the people are

5694
02:17:24,041 --> 02:17:24,431
going to die.

5695
02:17:24,431 --> 02:17:25,270
And that's not acceptable.

5696
02:17:25,820 --> 02:17:26,230
Right,

5697
02:17:26,230 --> 02:17:26,531
right.

5698
02:17:26,531 --> 02:17:26,801
I mean,

5699
02:17:26,801 --> 02:17:28,630
you can't really regulate
what people are going to do,

5700
02:17:28,690 --> 02:17:29,310
you know,

5701
02:17:29,310 --> 02:17:30,940
just give them a suit.

5702
02:17:30,941 --> 02:17:31,121
You know,

5703
02:17:31,121 --> 02:17:32,650
those guys are mostly doing it illegally.

5704
02:17:32,980 --> 02:17:33,813
But man,

5705
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:35,800
just the ability to,

5706
02:17:36,250 --> 02:17:36,491
you know,

5707
02:17:36,491 --> 02:17:38,930
I was once interviewing a fighter,

5708
02:17:38,960 --> 02:17:41,230
a test pilot went on
to become an astronaut.

5709
02:17:41,710 --> 02:17:43,570
And I was asking him,

5710
02:17:43,571 --> 02:17:44,410
how did you,

5711
02:17:44,440 --> 02:17:48,720
how do you not freak out when you are
sitting on top this bomb on the launch

5712
02:17:48,721 --> 02:17:49,121
pad?

5713
02:17:49,121 --> 02:17:49,271
Like,

5714
02:17:49,271 --> 02:17:50,680
how do you not just like you were saying,

5715
02:17:50,681 --> 02:17:50,861
you know,

5716
02:17:50,861 --> 02:17:52,690
about getting out of the
sensory deprivation tank,

5717
02:17:52,691 --> 02:17:52,871
like,

5718
02:17:52,871 --> 02:17:53,080
you know,

5719
02:17:53,080 --> 02:17:55,270
leap to your feet and
scramble at the door.

5720
02:17:55,271 --> 02:17:55,421
Like,

5721
02:17:55,421 --> 02:17:57,250
how do you resist the impulse to do that?

5722
02:17:57,250 --> 02:17:57,581
And he said,

5723
02:17:57,581 --> 02:17:57,821
well,

5724
02:17:57,821 --> 02:17:58,001
you know,

5725
02:17:58,001 --> 02:17:58,300
we're,

5726
02:17:58,300 --> 02:17:59,081
we're trained,

5727
02:17:59,081 --> 02:17:59,271
you know,

5728
02:17:59,271 --> 02:17:59,650
were,

5729
02:17:59,650 --> 02:18:02,140
were recruited and trained for a specific,

5730
02:18:02,390 --> 02:18:02,590
uh,

5731
02:18:02,590 --> 02:18:03,251
ability,

5732
02:18:03,251 --> 02:18:03,541
you know,

5733
02:18:03,541 --> 02:18:05,530
and situational awareness
as we described it.

5734
02:18:06,010 --> 02:18:06,321
And,

5735
02:18:06,321 --> 02:18:06,430
uh,

5736
02:18:06,430 --> 02:18:11,430
he said that one of the examples of it
is what he called winding the clock.

5737
02:18:11,501 --> 02:18:11,951
And I was like,

5738
02:18:11,951 --> 02:18:12,784
what's wanting o'clock?

5739
02:18:13,210 --> 02:18:17,590
He had been a test pilot out
of Edwards over here and uh,

5740
02:18:17,620 --> 02:18:20,200
was one day assigned
to shoot down a drone,

5741
02:18:20,670 --> 02:18:20,950
uh,

5742
02:18:20,950 --> 02:18:22,660
to test a new air to air missile.

5743
02:18:22,720 --> 02:18:24,790
And so he comes out of this steep turn,

5744
02:18:24,791 --> 02:18:25,900
fires the rocket,

5745
02:18:26,290 --> 02:18:28,820
and it doesn't leave his wing if the,

5746
02:18:29,170 --> 02:18:29,680
the,

5747
02:18:29,680 --> 02:18:29,921
you know,

5748
02:18:29,921 --> 02:18:31,120
he hears it go,

5749
02:18:31,150 --> 02:18:32,860
but it doesn't actually leave the jet.

5750
02:18:33,140 --> 02:18:34,630
She looks over and it's armed,

5751
02:18:34,631 --> 02:18:34,800
right?

5752
02:18:34,800 --> 02:18:36,460
And he's done.

5753
02:18:36,710 --> 02:18:37,750
He's ready to blow up,

5754
02:18:37,751 --> 02:18:38,231
ready to blow up.

5755
02:18:38,231 --> 02:18:39,540
It's getting back.

5756
02:18:39,550 --> 02:18:39,851
Fuck.

5757
02:18:39,851 --> 02:18:40,360
And you're done.

5758
02:18:40,360 --> 02:18:40,501
Right,

5759
02:18:40,501 --> 02:18:41,200
right.

5760
02:18:41,200 --> 02:18:42,350
And so the moment right there,

5761
02:18:42,370 --> 02:18:44,860
the reaction you're having
even to hear the story,

5762
02:18:44,861 --> 02:18:45,041
right,

5763
02:18:45,041 --> 02:18:46,690
it's the same reaction I
had on the same reaction.

5764
02:18:46,690 --> 02:18:49,720
So many people would have like
eject immediately are like panic,

5765
02:18:49,750 --> 02:18:49,991
you know,

5766
02:18:49,991 --> 02:18:50,201
whatever.

5767
02:18:50,201 --> 02:18:51,610
It's just bad news.

5768
02:18:51,940 --> 02:18:54,400
And he said that in that moment
they're trained to wind the clock.

5769
02:18:54,401 --> 02:18:56,040
They literally would reach up to a,

5770
02:18:56,050 --> 02:19:01,050
a cheap clock that they had duct taped
to the dash of this fighter and wind it

5771
02:19:01,841 --> 02:19:02,800
to keep it going.

5772
02:19:03,100 --> 02:19:06,580
And you're trained to do that to
in order to have a little downtime,

5773
02:19:06,790 --> 02:19:08,560
to think through what
you're going to do next.

5774
02:19:08,740 --> 02:19:12,070
And in the amount of time it takes
him to reach up and crank that dial,

5775
02:19:12,280 --> 02:19:13,360
he is,

5776
02:19:13,460 --> 02:19:14,293
uh,

5777
02:19:14,380 --> 02:19:15,130
hearing,

5778
02:19:15,130 --> 02:19:15,640
uh,

5779
02:19:15,640 --> 02:19:16,180
you know,

5780
02:19:16,180 --> 02:19:16,960
thinking through,

5781
02:19:16,960 --> 02:19:17,201
okay,

5782
02:19:17,201 --> 02:19:18,580
well it's kind of a nice day.

5783
02:19:18,970 --> 02:19:19,631
Would I go out?

5784
02:19:19,631 --> 02:19:23,200
Shall I go out across Los Angeles
and over the ocean and ditch there?

5785
02:19:23,410 --> 02:19:23,681
It's like,

5786
02:19:23,681 --> 02:19:23,831
well,

5787
02:19:23,831 --> 02:19:24,131
no,

5788
02:19:24,131 --> 02:19:24,580
first of all,

5789
02:19:24,580 --> 02:19:24,761
you know,

5790
02:19:24,761 --> 02:19:25,150
that's,

5791
02:19:25,150 --> 02:19:28,820
that's a lot of people and I can't go
over with an armed missile over a lot of

5792
02:19:28,821 --> 02:19:29,840
people and then I don't want to be,

5793
02:19:29,841 --> 02:19:31,370
the guy lost the $40 million airplane.

5794
02:19:31,790 --> 02:19:33,850
So he then thinks it through this morning.

5795
02:19:33,851 --> 02:19:34,071
Mornings.

5796
02:19:34,071 --> 02:19:35,960
Like the weather's pretty good today.

5797
02:19:35,961 --> 02:19:37,340
I think I can probably make it.

5798
02:19:37,341 --> 02:19:41,690
And by God he lands it totally like go
does the corkscrew and comes in and lands

5799
02:19:41,691 --> 02:19:42,980
of playing with live arm at a time.

5800
02:19:43,110 --> 02:19:43,730
Oh,

5801
02:19:43,730 --> 02:19:44,563
it makes it right.

5802
02:19:44,630 --> 02:19:45,463
And that's what they,

5803
02:19:45,520 --> 02:19:47,710
what are they telling him
at the base when he's like,

5804
02:19:47,711 --> 02:19:48,251
hey guys,

5805
02:19:48,251 --> 02:19:49,210
I'm flying in hot.

5806
02:19:49,240 --> 02:19:49,781
I wonder,

5807
02:19:49,781 --> 02:19:51,490
I bet there's a procedure,

5808
02:19:51,520 --> 02:19:51,761
right?

5809
02:19:51,761 --> 02:19:54,450
Air Force people would probably
have a procedure for that car.

5810
02:19:54,460 --> 02:19:54,850
And they stepped,

5811
02:19:54,850 --> 02:19:56,470
fuck you.

5812
02:19:56,900 --> 02:19:57,640
Who Does it?

5813
02:19:57,640 --> 02:20:00,120
They get every general mile radius,

5814
02:20:00,121 --> 02:20:00,311
you know.

5815
02:20:00,311 --> 02:20:01,061
But I said to him,

5816
02:20:01,061 --> 02:20:01,300
like,

5817
02:20:01,300 --> 02:20:02,620
I don't understand how you're able to,

5818
02:20:02,620 --> 02:20:02,890
I'll do that.

5819
02:20:02,890 --> 02:20:03,221
And he's like,

5820
02:20:03,221 --> 02:20:03,371
yeah,

5821
02:20:03,371 --> 02:20:04,240
we're just trained to,

5822
02:20:04,241 --> 02:20:04,570
you know,

5823
02:20:04,570 --> 02:20:06,040
we have that ability,

5824
02:20:06,070 --> 02:20:06,281
you know?

5825
02:20:06,281 --> 02:20:06,400
And,

5826
02:20:06,400 --> 02:20:08,230
and that's true when you look across all,

5827
02:20:08,390 --> 02:20:09,223
uh,

5828
02:20:09,280 --> 02:20:09,491
you know,

5829
02:20:09,491 --> 02:20:10,480
there's another astronaut story.

5830
02:20:10,660 --> 02:20:10,961
This guy,

5831
02:20:10,961 --> 02:20:14,320
Franklin Chang Diaz was a
Costa Rican national who,

5832
02:20:14,410 --> 02:20:14,790
who,

5833
02:20:14,790 --> 02:20:15,170
uh,

5834
02:20:15,170 --> 02:20:15,760
uh,

5835
02:20:15,760 --> 02:20:16,750
was an astronaut,

5836
02:20:17,020 --> 02:20:18,100
a on the shuttle.

5837
02:20:18,520 --> 02:20:22,070
And he narrowly avoided being killed in
both the Columbia and the challenge or

5838
02:20:22,071 --> 02:20:22,661
disasters.

5839
02:20:22,661 --> 02:20:23,650
He was training for both.

5840
02:20:23,651 --> 02:20:26,950
And through a fluke of scheduling did
not go on either and saw all of his

5841
02:20:26,951 --> 02:20:28,930
friends and colleagues killed
in these two disasters.

5842
02:20:28,931 --> 02:20:29,440
I mean,

5843
02:20:29,440 --> 02:20:32,170
unbelievable tragedy for this guy twice.

5844
02:20:32,710 --> 02:20:36,670
And he still hold shares the
record for the most times in space,

5845
02:20:37,000 --> 02:20:37,510
uh,

5846
02:20:37,510 --> 02:20:38,080
and,

5847
02:20:38,080 --> 02:20:38,440
uh,

5848
02:20:38,440 --> 02:20:39,160
you know,

5849
02:20:39,160 --> 02:20:39,993
was,

5850
02:20:40,440 --> 02:20:40,750
uh,

5851
02:20:40,750 --> 02:20:41,560
has done more,

5852
02:20:41,560 --> 02:20:42,820
I think more space walks in.

5853
02:20:42,821 --> 02:20:43,840
Anybody else or something like that.

5854
02:20:43,841 --> 02:20:45,700
It's just absolutely
superlative human being.

5855
02:20:46,150 --> 02:20:49,660
And he had this story of a
floating out there with this,

5856
02:20:49,661 --> 02:20:49,901
you know,

5857
02:20:49,901 --> 02:20:53,350
$60 million piece of equipment that
he's got to move from this place to this

5858
02:20:53,351 --> 02:20:54,184
place or whatever.

5859
02:20:54,400 --> 02:20:55,750
And as he's doing it,

5860
02:20:56,440 --> 02:20:59,710
he looks down in the clouds of part of
beneath them and there's Costa Rica and

5861
02:20:59,711 --> 02:21:00,670
he realizes I'm the,

5862
02:21:00,700 --> 02:21:02,260
I'm the only person in my,

5863
02:21:02,261 --> 02:21:04,360
of my nation who will ever have this view.

5864
02:21:04,780 --> 02:21:05,290
Um,

5865
02:21:05,290 --> 02:21:05,531
you know,

5866
02:21:05,531 --> 02:21:06,364
in all likelihood.

5867
02:21:06,640 --> 02:21:10,510
And he's got his camera attached
to his belt and he was the city.

5868
02:21:10,511 --> 02:21:11,290
He was thinking to himself,

5869
02:21:11,290 --> 02:21:14,680
I can just reach down and grab
the camera and take the photo,

5870
02:21:14,950 --> 02:21:15,250
uh,

5871
02:21:15,250 --> 02:21:15,700
of,

5872
02:21:15,700 --> 02:21:15,941
you know,

5873
02:21:15,941 --> 02:21:18,010
that all Costa Ricans will
have on their wall basically.

5874
02:21:18,011 --> 02:21:18,970
I'm sure you didn't have that thought,

5875
02:21:18,971 --> 02:21:19,270
but to,

5876
02:21:19,270 --> 02:21:19,481
you know,

5877
02:21:19,481 --> 02:21:20,350
to me that's where it is.

5878
02:21:21,280 --> 02:21:25,660
And he doesn't do it because he would
have had to let go of this piece of

5879
02:21:25,661 --> 02:21:27,760
equipment and go for the camera,

5880
02:21:27,790 --> 02:21:28,121
you know,

5881
02:21:28,121 --> 02:21:29,860
and he's got a duty to perform.

5882
02:21:29,861 --> 02:21:30,310
He's like,

5883
02:21:30,310 --> 02:21:30,731
they put me,

5884
02:21:30,731 --> 02:21:33,250
they brought me here to do this job for
me to do this job and he scooted over.

5885
02:21:33,370 --> 02:21:34,001
But again,

5886
02:21:34,001 --> 02:21:36,880
that's a piece of programming
that he's resisting.

5887
02:21:36,881 --> 02:21:37,091
You know,

5888
02:21:37,091 --> 02:21:40,810
like by his training and his steadfastness
of whatever it is in his brain.

5889
02:21:40,811 --> 02:21:40,991
Like,

5890
02:21:40,991 --> 02:21:41,201
man,

5891
02:21:41,201 --> 02:21:44,380
that guy doesn't just do
what I would have done.

5892
02:21:44,381 --> 02:21:46,960
We just throw the piece of
equipment out into space and take,

5893
02:21:47,020 --> 02:21:47,490
you know?

5894
02:21:47,490 --> 02:21:47,641
Yeah.

5895
02:21:47,641 --> 02:21:49,290
Training is a fascinating thing,

5896
02:21:49,310 --> 02:21:49,610
right?

5897
02:21:49,610 --> 02:21:54,060
The idea of developing your skills and
your mindset to the point where you can

5898
02:21:54,061 --> 02:21:57,900
do extremely dangerous things and
keep your composure and that that's a,

5899
02:21:57,901 --> 02:21:58,610
that's it's,

5900
02:21:58,610 --> 02:21:58,931
it's,

5901
02:21:58,931 --> 02:22:00,240
it's very attractive to us.

5902
02:22:00,241 --> 02:22:02,160
So we'll wear a fascinated by heroes.

5903
02:22:02,230 --> 02:22:03,120
That's why we need them.

5904
02:22:03,190 --> 02:22:03,520
Yeah.

5905
02:22:03,520 --> 02:22:04,353
We need them.

5906
02:22:04,410 --> 02:22:04,811
We need them.

5907
02:22:04,811 --> 02:22:07,530
They have to be able to do that even
when it doesn't mean anything like this.

5908
02:22:07,531 --> 02:22:11,880
I think that's part of the reason why I
think like x games and stuff along those

5909
02:22:11,881 --> 02:22:12,211
lines.

5910
02:22:12,211 --> 02:22:15,120
If it's part of the evolutionary
process to compete against each other,

5911
02:22:15,121 --> 02:22:17,330
to see who can do the more
and more fucked up things.

5912
02:22:17,331 --> 02:22:17,460
Yeah,

5913
02:22:17,460 --> 02:22:17,970
sure.

5914
02:22:17,970 --> 02:22:21,210
And that there's something that's
gets developed along the line.

5915
02:22:21,240 --> 02:22:21,600
Totally.

5916
02:22:21,600 --> 02:22:23,220
It's testing the limits of the human body.

5917
02:22:23,221 --> 02:22:25,980
I think everybody's just
really wants be able to fly

5918
02:22:25,980 --> 02:22:26,491
or do whatever.

5919
02:22:26,491 --> 02:22:26,800
You know,

5920
02:22:26,800 --> 02:22:27,330
there's,

5921
02:22:27,330 --> 02:22:28,800
there's this extreme,

5922
02:22:28,830 --> 02:22:30,560
and it's cliche to say about it,

5923
02:22:30,580 --> 02:22:30,780
right?

5924
02:22:30,780 --> 02:22:33,680
An extreme or you're trying
to find the extremity of your,

5925
02:22:33,681 --> 02:22:34,920
of the law of life.

5926
02:22:34,921 --> 02:22:36,600
You're trying to find how
close to death can I get

5927
02:22:36,710 --> 02:22:39,410
and in finding the limits
of human performance.

5928
02:22:39,411 --> 02:22:43,910
And I think it's a part of the grand
equation of the human race period.

5929
02:22:43,911 --> 02:22:44,480
It's like,

5930
02:22:44,480 --> 02:22:45,740
it is a part of the,

5931
02:22:45,741 --> 02:22:45,970
of,

5932
02:22:45,970 --> 02:22:46,480
of the,

5933
02:22:46,480 --> 02:22:48,050
the numbers right now.

5934
02:22:48,051 --> 02:22:49,940
We know that people can
run a four minute mile.

5935
02:22:49,941 --> 02:22:51,200
Now we know that people can do that.

5936
02:22:51,201 --> 02:22:51,411
You know,

5937
02:22:51,411 --> 02:22:56,150
it's all of these things as sort of
aid and the progress of the race.

5938
02:22:56,151 --> 02:22:56,420
Yeah,

5939
02:22:56,420 --> 02:22:56,751
that's right.

5940
02:22:56,751 --> 02:22:56,990
Some,

5941
02:22:56,990 --> 02:22:57,770
yeah.

5942
02:22:57,770 --> 02:22:58,420
Well you need,

5943
02:22:58,420 --> 02:22:58,701
you know,

5944
02:22:58,701 --> 02:22:59,810
you need the person to go first.

5945
02:22:59,811 --> 02:23:01,790
You need the person to come pull
people out of burning buildings.

5946
02:23:01,791 --> 02:23:02,091
There's a,

5947
02:23:02,091 --> 02:23:02,770
there's Europe say,

5948
02:23:02,770 --> 02:23:02,961
right?

5949
02:23:02,961 --> 02:23:03,300
There's a,

5950
02:23:03,300 --> 02:23:04,133
there's a,

5951
02:23:04,550 --> 02:23:05,010
you know,

5952
02:23:05,010 --> 02:23:05,200
a,

5953
02:23:05,200 --> 02:23:08,710
a purpose to having that
kind of Alpha person

5954
02:23:08,930 --> 02:23:09,300
the,

5955
02:23:09,300 --> 02:23:13,460
as we become a more and more
advanced society that need sort of,

5956
02:23:13,630 --> 02:23:14,570
maybe it's going away.

5957
02:23:14,600 --> 02:23:15,040
That's,

5958
02:23:15,040 --> 02:23:15,830
I think it is.

5959
02:23:15,830 --> 02:23:16,041
I mean,

5960
02:23:16,041 --> 02:23:17,210
that's why a guy like you can,

5961
02:23:17,211 --> 02:23:17,451
you know,

5962
02:23:17,451 --> 02:23:19,370
you're obviously a
successful intelligent guy,

5963
02:23:19,371 --> 02:23:20,720
but you're like joking around about,

5964
02:23:20,721 --> 02:23:20,961
oh,

5965
02:23:20,961 --> 02:23:21,794
I can't handle fear.

5966
02:23:22,100 --> 02:23:22,460
Right.

5967
02:23:22,460 --> 02:23:22,660
You know,

5968
02:23:22,660 --> 02:23:23,600
it's cause you don't have to.

5969
02:23:23,680 --> 02:23:23,951
Yeah,

5970
02:23:23,951 --> 02:23:24,190
I know.

5971
02:23:24,190 --> 02:23:24,340
Well,

5972
02:23:24,340 --> 02:23:24,971
and I never will.

5973
02:23:24,971 --> 02:23:25,511
That's exactly right.

5974
02:23:25,511 --> 02:23:25,631
Well,

5975
02:23:25,631 --> 02:23:26,464
I mean that's not true.

5976
02:23:26,500 --> 02:23:27,180
That's not true.

5977
02:23:27,180 --> 02:23:28,120
I might write and,

5978
02:23:28,140 --> 02:23:30,310
and I have in my personal life experience,

5979
02:23:30,311 --> 02:23:31,000
you know,

5980
02:23:31,000 --> 02:23:31,870
extreme situations.

5981
02:23:31,871 --> 02:23:32,621
I'm sure everybody has,

5982
02:23:32,621 --> 02:23:33,880
everybody has tragedies in their lives.

5983
02:23:34,060 --> 02:23:34,251
You know,

5984
02:23:34,251 --> 02:23:35,081
the stuff that's gone on.

5985
02:23:35,081 --> 02:23:36,160
But you know,

5986
02:23:36,161 --> 02:23:36,431
the,

5987
02:23:36,431 --> 02:23:36,970
the,

5988
02:23:36,970 --> 02:23:37,540
the concern,

5989
02:23:37,540 --> 02:23:39,760
the consistent ability to,

5990
02:23:39,910 --> 02:23:42,440
to resist fear and do you know,

5991
02:23:42,650 --> 02:23:45,490
the needful in the face of terrible odds.

5992
02:23:45,491 --> 02:23:46,420
That is a crazy thing.

5993
02:23:46,600 --> 02:23:46,811
You know.

5994
02:23:46,811 --> 02:23:47,411
At the same time though,

5995
02:23:47,411 --> 02:23:47,950
we're also,

5996
02:23:47,950 --> 02:23:48,161
you know,

5997
02:23:48,161 --> 02:23:49,750
we just did a story recently about how,

5998
02:23:49,980 --> 02:23:50,410
um,

5999
02:23:50,410 --> 02:23:55,410
there's a whole Darpa a challenge around
creating rescue robots that would,

6000
02:23:55,480 --> 02:23:56,920
that would replace firefighters,

6001
02:23:56,921 --> 02:23:57,850
would replace people.

6002
02:23:58,060 --> 02:23:59,470
Not In all circumstances,

6003
02:23:59,471 --> 02:24:00,850
but in circumstances where like Fukushima,

6004
02:24:00,851 --> 02:24:02,470
where there's radiation,

6005
02:24:02,471 --> 02:24:03,970
you can't send people right
into the middle of it,

6006
02:24:04,180 --> 02:24:07,840
but you want to be able to send in a
robot that can cut its way through a door,

6007
02:24:08,080 --> 02:24:08,891
look around,

6008
02:24:08,891 --> 02:24:10,240
maybe bring somebody back.

6009
02:24:10,570 --> 02:24:13,660
And so the challenges that the Darpa
are putting out there include like

6010
02:24:13,690 --> 02:24:15,880
literally being able to cut
through door with a saws all,

6011
02:24:16,240 --> 02:24:16,990
uh,

6012
02:24:16,990 --> 02:24:17,630
you know,

6013
02:24:17,630 --> 02:24:18,250
uh,

6014
02:24:18,250 --> 02:24:19,360
drive a car.

6015
02:24:19,420 --> 02:24:22,030
The thing has to be able to get
into a car and drive away with it.

6016
02:24:22,031 --> 02:24:22,864
It's literally like the,

6017
02:24:23,170 --> 02:24:24,550
the rules have been written
by an eight year old.

6018
02:24:24,551 --> 02:24:24,671
I mean,

6019
02:24:24,671 --> 02:24:27,550
it's incredible the challenge that they're
putting out in front of these people

6020
02:24:27,551 --> 02:24:28,384
and people are doing it.

6021
02:24:28,750 --> 02:24:31,750
The Dharma robots are some
of the creepiest things
that have ever been created

6022
02:24:31,780 --> 02:24:32,613
by humans.

6023
02:24:33,190 --> 02:24:33,990
Dogs,

6024
02:24:33,990 --> 02:24:34,420
uh,

6025
02:24:34,420 --> 02:24:35,050
Cheetahs.

6026
02:24:35,050 --> 02:24:35,550
Totally.

6027
02:24:35,550 --> 02:24:35,680
The,

6028
02:24:35,680 --> 02:24:37,100
the one that looks like a,

6029
02:24:37,280 --> 02:24:41,260
looks like a pack mule or disturbing
to look at the latest model can throw

6030
02:24:41,261 --> 02:24:41,711
things.

6031
02:24:41,711 --> 02:24:42,970
And now I forget like bricks,

6032
02:24:42,971 --> 02:24:43,451
I think it is.

6033
02:24:43,451 --> 02:24:44,530
I can throw bricks.

6034
02:24:44,730 --> 02:24:44,950
Oh,

6035
02:24:44,950 --> 02:24:45,610
a Jack's.

6036
02:24:45,610 --> 02:24:46,150
Yeah,

6037
02:24:46,150 --> 02:24:46,470
yeah,

6038
02:24:46,470 --> 02:24:46,761
yeah,

6039
02:24:46,761 --> 02:24:47,130
yeah.

6040
02:24:47,130 --> 02:24:47,921
There's a whole,

6041
02:24:47,921 --> 02:24:48,191
also,

6042
02:24:48,191 --> 02:24:51,220
there's a whole field of study
around trying to make robots.

6043
02:24:51,220 --> 02:24:51,491
We were,

6044
02:24:51,491 --> 02:24:53,650
we were messing with this on our cover
when we were putting together the cover a

6045
02:24:53,651 --> 02:24:54,490
couple of issues ago.

6046
02:24:54,790 --> 02:24:57,940
We put one of these robots on
the cover from Virginia Tech.

6047
02:24:57,941 --> 02:24:58,691
It's a real robot.

6048
02:24:58,691 --> 02:24:59,241
What we put in there,

6049
02:24:59,241 --> 02:25:00,140
I was like actually what it,

6050
02:25:00,210 --> 02:25:00,580
you know,

6051
02:25:00,580 --> 02:25:02,620
could somebody look like it's
definitely what it's headed for.

6052
02:25:03,070 --> 02:25:04,210
And uh,

6053
02:25:04,270 --> 02:25:06,250
they've built the legs
and the whole thing,

6054
02:25:06,280 --> 02:25:07,150
it's just unbelievable.

6055
02:25:07,151 --> 02:25:07,780
But,

6056
02:25:07,780 --> 02:25:08,440
um,

6057
02:25:08,440 --> 02:25:09,910
when we first put the cover together,

6058
02:25:09,911 --> 02:25:11,200
it was reaching for you,

6059
02:25:11,201 --> 02:25:14,980
trying to save you through a broken
window basically in this sort of ruined

6060
02:25:14,981 --> 02:25:15,814
environment.

6061
02:25:15,910 --> 02:25:16,360
Um,

6062
02:25:16,360 --> 02:25:16,850
which is,

6063
02:25:16,850 --> 02:25:17,250
uh,

6064
02:25:17,250 --> 02:25:17,420
the,

6065
02:25:17,420 --> 02:25:19,720
the environment that the thing
is going to have to compete in.

6066
02:25:20,170 --> 02:25:22,120
But it looked like it was
reaching for you to kill you.

6067
02:25:22,330 --> 02:25:24,250
Like it a scary cover.

6068
02:25:24,250 --> 02:25:26,770
The robot looked frightening and the,

6069
02:25:27,310 --> 02:25:28,720
we decided in the end like,

6070
02:25:28,721 --> 02:25:28,931
wait,

6071
02:25:28,931 --> 02:25:32,410
we've got to make this thing not look
like it caused all this damage because we

6072
02:25:32,411 --> 02:25:33,970
as people are terrified of,

6073
02:25:34,330 --> 02:25:34,690
uh,

6074
02:25:34,690 --> 02:25:35,081
robots.

6075
02:25:35,081 --> 02:25:35,980
They just look scary.

6076
02:25:35,981 --> 02:25:37,720
And if you make them all
black and militaristic,

6077
02:25:37,721 --> 02:25:37,931
you know,

6078
02:25:37,931 --> 02:25:38,220
like,

6079
02:25:38,220 --> 02:25:41,830
you know the graphite look is scary
and so you've got to paint them like

6080
02:25:41,831 --> 02:25:43,420
ambulances is what these
guys are all learning.

6081
02:25:43,440 --> 02:25:48,010
Look at this robot throwing a cinder
block just whips out now the lock itself.

6082
02:25:48,011 --> 02:25:48,820
Yeah.

6083
02:25:48,820 --> 02:25:49,001
Yeah,

6084
02:25:49,001 --> 02:25:50,710
but look how he uses his legs too.

6085
02:25:50,740 --> 02:25:55,120
I mean it does look like the shot talk
kicks in and that's a cinderblock man.

6086
02:25:55,450 --> 02:25:55,691
I mean,

6087
02:25:55,691 --> 02:25:56,740
could a human even do that?

6088
02:25:56,860 --> 02:25:59,270
And what if that's a grenade
instead of a cinder block?

6089
02:25:59,290 --> 02:25:59,770
Yeah,

6090
02:25:59,770 --> 02:26:03,270
you showed this to little kids and it
just scares the hell out of our lives.

6091
02:26:03,390 --> 02:26:03,780
Yeah.

6092
02:26:03,780 --> 02:26:07,810
Creepy spider looking thing like our
natural instincts or be terrified of that

6093
02:26:08,270 --> 02:26:10,030
Sheila that has antlers.

6094
02:26:10,120 --> 02:26:12,790
It's got defect that's growing antlers.

6095
02:26:13,090 --> 02:26:14,070
It's a real transplant.

6096
02:26:15,190 --> 02:26:15,821
There's another,

6097
02:26:15,821 --> 02:26:20,821
a robot that they've found they've
invented that drives up to a wall and they

6098
02:26:21,281 --> 02:26:26,281
can spring up through the air and
you can clear like these big walls.

6099
02:26:26,630 --> 02:26:26,830
Totally.

6100
02:26:26,830 --> 02:26:27,790
We give out an award this year.

6101
02:26:27,791 --> 02:26:28,060
Yeah,

6102
02:26:28,060 --> 02:26:28,721
it's an amazing thing.

6103
02:26:28,721 --> 02:26:30,070
I can jump like 30 you know,

6104
02:26:30,100 --> 02:26:31,060
30 or 40 feet.

6105
02:26:31,061 --> 02:26:32,470
It can clear a single story building.

6106
02:26:32,710 --> 02:26:33,940
The idea being that it can,

6107
02:26:33,970 --> 02:26:34,350
uh,

6108
02:26:34,350 --> 02:26:34,720
you know,

6109
02:26:34,720 --> 02:26:35,980
get in wherever you need it to.

6110
02:26:36,010 --> 02:26:36,191
Right.

6111
02:26:36,191 --> 02:26:37,090
You're up on a ridge,

6112
02:26:37,091 --> 02:26:39,340
you send it down and it can leap,

6113
02:26:39,540 --> 02:26:39,881
you know,

6114
02:26:39,881 --> 02:26:40,540
off a cliff.

6115
02:26:40,540 --> 02:26:42,940
That's the other thing is you can roll
it off a cliff and I'll survive the fall.

6116
02:26:42,941 --> 02:26:43,840
It's incredibly Harvey.

6117
02:26:44,320 --> 02:26:45,153
It's crazy.

6118
02:26:45,740 --> 02:26:46,690
Does that translate?

6119
02:26:46,691 --> 02:26:51,691
That has grown at birth defect that
started growing antlers and jam bands.

6120
02:26:51,931 --> 02:26:52,870
Scared of spiders.

6121
02:26:52,871 --> 02:26:53,770
We just found out as,

6122
02:26:53,771 --> 02:26:55,030
he can't even look at this photo

6123
02:26:58,120 --> 02:26:58,541
thing.

6124
02:26:58,541 --> 02:26:59,710
Those little antlers.

6125
02:26:59,830 --> 02:27:01,690
Well that's like when a
person is born with a tail.

6126
02:27:01,691 --> 02:27:01,931
You're like,

6127
02:27:01,931 --> 02:27:02,380
what?

6128
02:27:02,380 --> 02:27:05,530
What is going on in the genome
where that's representing itself.

6129
02:27:07,780 --> 02:27:08,980
That's strange.

6130
02:27:09,040 --> 02:27:10,090
Strange little animal.

6131
02:27:10,410 --> 02:27:10,570
Well,

6132
02:27:10,570 --> 02:27:12,610
spiders in general or creepy as fuck.

6133
02:27:12,970 --> 02:27:13,181
Yeah,

6134
02:27:13,181 --> 02:27:13,391
no,

6135
02:27:13,391 --> 02:27:13,551
I,

6136
02:27:13,551 --> 02:27:14,830
I have trouble with the snakes.

6137
02:27:14,890 --> 02:27:17,620
I have the like the natural
evolutionary response to snakes.

6138
02:27:17,621 --> 02:27:18,454
They've just,

6139
02:27:18,680 --> 02:27:23,680
that's literally spineless quality
video phobia of spiders thing.

6140
02:27:25,610 --> 02:27:26,730
It's called a video phobia.

6141
02:27:26,731 --> 02:27:26,921
Yeah.

6142
02:27:26,921 --> 02:27:27,790
It's very common though.

6143
02:27:28,840 --> 02:27:30,310
They just move in away that I'm not,

6144
02:27:30,750 --> 02:27:31,610
it doesn't like to follow up.

6145
02:27:31,620 --> 02:27:32,170
Well,

6146
02:27:32,170 --> 02:27:32,891
people that,

6147
02:27:32,891 --> 02:27:33,250
um,

6148
02:27:33,250 --> 02:27:33,880
you know,

6149
02:27:33,880 --> 02:27:37,840
I think the proponents of epigenetics
with would say that it's probably

6150
02:27:37,841 --> 02:27:41,110
somewhere in your evolutionary past or
somewhere in your genetic past rather

6151
02:27:41,111 --> 02:27:45,720
than someone got fucked up by a snake
and either some one of your ancestors saw

6152
02:27:45,920 --> 02:27:48,080
or one of your ancestors was wounded.

6153
02:27:48,230 --> 02:27:50,050
And we did a story about,

6154
02:27:50,080 --> 02:27:50,410
um,

6155
02:27:50,410 --> 02:27:53,170
we have a section of the magazine
where we basically ask incredibly dumb

6156
02:27:53,171 --> 02:27:54,550
questions of incredibly smart people.

6157
02:27:54,551 --> 02:27:55,300
And,

6158
02:27:55,300 --> 02:27:55,810
uh,

6159
02:27:55,810 --> 02:27:56,571
and it's great cause they,

6160
02:27:56,571 --> 02:27:58,660
they play along in this wonderful way.

6161
02:27:58,661 --> 02:27:59,740
So one of them was,

6162
02:28:00,100 --> 02:28:01,720
what's the world's grossest sound?

6163
02:28:02,200 --> 02:28:04,150
And literally there was a guy who had,

6164
02:28:04,320 --> 02:28:04,900
you know,

6165
02:28:04,900 --> 02:28:06,400
done a study to determine it.

6166
02:28:06,670 --> 02:28:09,910
And he had determined that the sound
was the sound of vomiting that,

6167
02:28:10,000 --> 02:28:10,300
uh,

6168
02:28:10,300 --> 02:28:10,700
that,

6169
02:28:10,700 --> 02:28:15,700
and they simulated by pouring a bucket
of baked beans into another bucket while

6170
02:28:16,301 --> 02:28:17,980
somebody else was making yakking noises,

6171
02:28:18,180 --> 02:28:18,390
they,

6172
02:28:18,390 --> 02:28:21,560
and they played all these different
noises for people and was the one that was

6173
02:28:21,561 --> 02:28:22,130
grossest.

6174
02:28:22,130 --> 02:28:25,970
And the reason they think the evolutionary
purpose of that in theory is that

6175
02:28:26,240 --> 02:28:27,470
when you as a group,

6176
02:28:27,530 --> 02:28:27,801
you know,

6177
02:28:27,801 --> 02:28:29,390
we're eating diseased,

6178
02:28:29,500 --> 02:28:30,080
you know,

6179
02:28:30,080 --> 02:28:30,770
uh,

6180
02:28:30,770 --> 02:28:32,750
elk or whatever around a fire,

6181
02:28:32,751 --> 02:28:33,584
you know,

6182
02:28:33,800 --> 02:28:34,760
20,000 years ago,

6183
02:28:35,190 --> 02:28:35,450
um,

6184
02:28:35,450 --> 02:28:36,680
and someone started to get sick,

6185
02:28:37,190 --> 02:28:40,070
everyone would know it and would
also throw up so that no one ate,

6186
02:28:40,130 --> 02:28:40,491
you know,

6187
02:28:40,491 --> 02:28:42,620
and no one in the tribe ate the diseased.

6188
02:28:42,740 --> 02:28:44,270
That's totally makes sense.

6189
02:28:44,640 --> 02:28:45,890
He's wondered why like,

6190
02:28:46,220 --> 02:28:46,580
well,

6191
02:28:46,580 --> 02:28:47,450
Dab also,

6192
02:28:47,451 --> 02:28:48,021
by the way,

6193
02:28:48,021 --> 02:28:49,220
can be bypassed.

6194
02:28:49,400 --> 02:28:51,110
And I can tell you that
from personal experience,

6195
02:28:51,111 --> 02:28:52,760
because when I was a kid in high school,

6196
02:28:53,030 --> 02:28:54,920
if like someone threw up in the hallway,

6197
02:28:54,980 --> 02:28:56,750
which always happen in school,

6198
02:28:57,140 --> 02:29:00,160
I would start throwing up and a lot
of other people start throwing up to,

6199
02:29:00,250 --> 02:29:00,710
you know,

6200
02:29:00,710 --> 02:29:00,880
no,

6201
02:29:00,880 --> 02:29:01,130
it's a,

6202
02:29:01,130 --> 02:29:05,100
it's just built in like that scene
in stand by me hiding contents,

6203
02:29:05,220 --> 02:29:06,053
these throws throat.

6204
02:29:06,260 --> 02:29:09,830
Well that doesn't work on me anymore
because of all my years of fear factor.

6205
02:29:09,890 --> 02:29:11,480
I've seen so many people throw up.

6206
02:29:11,481 --> 02:29:12,290
I've seen.

6207
02:29:12,290 --> 02:29:12,800
Really?

6208
02:29:12,800 --> 02:29:13,110
Yeah.

6209
02:29:13,110 --> 02:29:14,480
That's really interesting.

6210
02:29:14,680 --> 02:29:16,280
I don't know how many
people I've seen throw up.

6211
02:29:16,281 --> 02:29:17,090
I saw I,

6212
02:29:17,090 --> 02:29:19,880
we did 148 episodes and every episode,

6213
02:29:19,881 --> 02:29:21,860
somebody through a
totally are a test case.

6214
02:29:21,861 --> 02:29:22,850
That's really interesting.

6215
02:29:22,851 --> 02:29:25,010
So nothing makes me throw up anymore.

6216
02:29:25,400 --> 02:29:29,300
I could be right next to someone throwing
up on the ground and it doesn't bother

6217
02:29:29,301 --> 02:29:29,840
me.

6218
02:29:29,840 --> 02:29:30,500
In fact,

6219
02:29:30,500 --> 02:29:34,970
my wife threw up in her car once and
she was all upset because she couldn't

6220
02:29:34,971 --> 02:29:37,340
clean it because she would
throw up again and I was like,

6221
02:29:37,540 --> 02:29:38,373
I'll clean it.

6222
02:29:38,390 --> 02:29:39,500
Like it didn't bother me at all.

6223
02:29:40,100 --> 02:29:43,690
It's smell puke in her car in
August and it just got away from,

6224
02:29:43,750 --> 02:29:45,410
that totally goes away.

6225
02:29:45,980 --> 02:29:48,710
I can be at a bar and
someone threw up in a urinal,

6226
02:29:48,711 --> 02:29:49,360
a piano.

6227
02:29:49,360 --> 02:29:50,270
It doesn't freak me out.

6228
02:29:50,271 --> 02:29:51,104
Wow.

6229
02:29:51,520 --> 02:29:52,490
Gross is sound.

6230
02:29:52,491 --> 02:29:53,750
It's two guys fucking anyway.

6231
02:29:53,751 --> 02:29:54,570
I don't think he knows.

6232
02:29:54,570 --> 02:29:56,600
That sounds like busted.

6233
02:29:57,560 --> 02:29:58,850
I got to son.

6234
02:29:59,450 --> 02:29:59,721
Well,

6235
02:29:59,721 --> 02:30:02,160
unless you were gay then that'd
be the most awesome sound ever.

6236
02:30:02,510 --> 02:30:04,020
Well that was like the,

6237
02:30:04,040 --> 02:30:05,150
the idea of like,

6238
02:30:05,180 --> 02:30:09,650
do gay guys get accustomed
to the smell of poop of,

6239
02:30:09,651 --> 02:30:10,011
you know,

6240
02:30:10,011 --> 02:30:10,341
of it.

6241
02:30:10,341 --> 02:30:10,701
Was that,

6242
02:30:10,701 --> 02:30:14,390
is that like an okay smell to them
because they're in the anal sex?

6243
02:30:14,540 --> 02:30:15,050
I don't know.

6244
02:30:15,050 --> 02:30:15,771
I mean the,

6245
02:30:15,771 --> 02:30:16,604
the what,

6246
02:30:16,970 --> 02:30:19,250
what causes certain connections,

6247
02:30:19,251 --> 02:30:23,020
what causes you to be repulsed by certain
things is always very fascinating.

6248
02:30:23,030 --> 02:30:23,390
Yeah,

6249
02:30:23,390 --> 02:30:23,960
sure,

6250
02:30:23,960 --> 02:30:24,793
sure.

6251
02:30:24,800 --> 02:30:25,070
Yeah.

6252
02:30:25,070 --> 02:30:29,030
But that thing of the throw
up sounds totally makes sense.

6253
02:30:29,160 --> 02:30:29,900
It's just makes it,

6254
02:30:29,900 --> 02:30:30,860
it makes perfect sense.

6255
02:30:30,861 --> 02:30:31,430
Yeah,

6256
02:30:31,430 --> 02:30:31,970
that's right.

6257
02:30:31,970 --> 02:30:32,690
And you know,

6258
02:30:32,690 --> 02:30:35,060
anything liquid wishing death is,

6259
02:30:35,061 --> 02:30:35,930
I think awesome.

6260
02:30:35,960 --> 02:30:36,351
Actually.

6261
02:30:36,351 --> 02:30:37,430
The words that smell,

6262
02:30:37,520 --> 02:30:38,880
the smell of it and that is all sorts,

6263
02:30:38,881 --> 02:30:40,250
that's also a useful instinct.

6264
02:30:40,590 --> 02:30:40,970
Yeah.

6265
02:30:40,970 --> 02:30:41,451
You smell it.

6266
02:30:41,451 --> 02:30:42,290
You want to go the other way.

6267
02:30:42,291 --> 02:30:43,190
That's a good idea.

6268
02:30:43,250 --> 02:30:43,430
Yeah.

6269
02:30:43,430 --> 02:30:44,270
When I was a kid,

6270
02:30:44,271 --> 02:30:47,690
someone died in our apartment
building and they didn't find the,

6271
02:30:47,750 --> 02:30:51,620
it was an old lady and they didn't
find her body for a while and it was,

6272
02:30:51,621 --> 02:30:54,620
the entire floor had this horrible,

6273
02:30:54,621 --> 02:30:57,890
horrible odor to it
where you would walk in,

6274
02:30:57,891 --> 02:30:58,221
you know?

6275
02:30:58,221 --> 02:31:01,550
And then eventually they found out that
this lady had died and they went and

6276
02:31:01,551 --> 02:31:02,061
cleaned it up.

6277
02:31:02,061 --> 02:31:04,190
But the smell lasted forever.

6278
02:31:04,191 --> 02:31:04,650
Sure,

6279
02:31:04,650 --> 02:31:04,940
sure.

6280
02:31:04,940 --> 02:31:07,130
Took the longest time to clean that out.

6281
02:31:07,160 --> 02:31:08,930
It's not like any other dead smell.

6282
02:31:09,100 --> 02:31:09,351
Yeah,

6283
02:31:09,351 --> 02:31:09,591
no,

6284
02:31:09,591 --> 02:31:10,070
I mean it's,

6285
02:31:10,070 --> 02:31:11,600
it really is that thing of like,

6286
02:31:11,950 --> 02:31:13,070
it's also too,

6287
02:31:13,130 --> 02:31:14,780
we were just talking about
many hours ago about,

6288
02:31:14,810 --> 02:31:15,500
uh,

6289
02:31:15,500 --> 02:31:17,360
trying to have as few openings
as possible in the bundle.

6290
02:31:17,361 --> 02:31:18,860
And that's the other reason
you would want as few as,

6291
02:31:19,140 --> 02:31:19,920
and if there was some,

6292
02:31:19,920 --> 02:31:20,753
some

6293
02:31:20,760 --> 02:31:22,170
stuff you got to keep in there,

6294
02:31:22,200 --> 02:31:23,310
you don't want it out in the world.

6295
02:31:23,340 --> 02:31:26,460
And I think the fear that smells
probably to discourage predation.

6296
02:31:26,880 --> 02:31:27,181
Yeah.

6297
02:31:27,181 --> 02:31:27,451
And,

6298
02:31:27,451 --> 02:31:27,871
and,

6299
02:31:27,871 --> 02:31:28,171
uh,

6300
02:31:28,171 --> 02:31:31,890
when we were really starving to death
and people will find a dead person,

6301
02:31:31,891 --> 02:31:32,041
right.

6302
02:31:32,041 --> 02:31:33,780
And we'll fucking mountain
might as well just eat them.

6303
02:31:34,560 --> 02:31:35,393
That is part of it.

6304
02:31:35,430 --> 02:31:35,840
Or I would,

6305
02:31:35,840 --> 02:31:36,150
I would,

6306
02:31:36,150 --> 02:31:39,340
I'm sure one could make
that argument and you know,

6307
02:31:39,360 --> 02:31:40,091
the feeling of,

6308
02:31:40,091 --> 02:31:41,670
of there being a,

6309
02:31:41,700 --> 02:31:41,980
you know,

6310
02:31:41,980 --> 02:31:43,110
a purpose to,

6311
02:31:43,450 --> 02:31:43,890
uh,

6312
02:31:43,890 --> 02:31:44,730
staying away from,

6313
02:31:44,731 --> 02:31:44,911
you know,

6314
02:31:44,911 --> 02:31:45,301
you know,

6315
02:31:45,301 --> 02:31:47,820
that like dysentery results from,

6316
02:31:47,970 --> 02:31:48,241
you know,

6317
02:31:48,241 --> 02:31:50,490
if you don't have adequate waste
systems and people are writing,

6318
02:31:50,500 --> 02:31:51,870
if it infects the drinking water,

6319
02:31:51,871 --> 02:31:53,760
like there's so many
reasons to stay away from,

6320
02:31:54,180 --> 02:31:54,600
from,

6321
02:31:54,600 --> 02:31:54,960
uh,

6322
02:31:54,960 --> 02:31:55,260
yeah.

6323
02:31:55,260 --> 02:31:55,620
The,

6324
02:31:55,620 --> 02:31:56,850
the dirtiest parts of people.

6325
02:31:56,910 --> 02:31:57,271
That's right.

6326
02:31:57,271 --> 02:31:57,360
Yeah.

6327
02:31:57,360 --> 02:31:57,841
Yeah.

6328
02:31:57,841 --> 02:32:00,870
The evolutionary desire
to escape stinky people.

6329
02:32:01,440 --> 02:32:01,830
Right,

6330
02:32:01,830 --> 02:32:02,191
right.

6331
02:32:02,191 --> 02:32:03,630
So there's a whole thesis there.

6332
02:32:03,631 --> 02:32:04,490
I'm sure somebody,

6333
02:32:04,650 --> 02:32:06,390
why is bad breath so horrible then?

6334
02:32:06,980 --> 02:32:07,230
I mean,

6335
02:32:07,230 --> 02:32:08,650
that can't really affect you for real.

6336
02:32:08,680 --> 02:32:09,241
I guess it can.

6337
02:32:09,241 --> 02:32:10,380
Maybe if the person sick though,

6338
02:32:10,381 --> 02:32:10,710
right.

6339
02:32:10,710 --> 02:32:12,570
Sometimes it can be a symptom of disease.

6340
02:32:12,571 --> 02:32:13,404
That's interesting.

6341
02:32:13,800 --> 02:32:13,981
Yeah.

6342
02:32:13,981 --> 02:32:14,814
Maybe that's why.

6343
02:32:15,560 --> 02:32:16,110
That's right.

6344
02:32:16,110 --> 02:32:17,310
This guy's not well.

6345
02:32:17,370 --> 02:32:18,270
I gotta get Outta here.

6346
02:32:18,420 --> 02:32:19,253
That's funny.

6347
02:32:19,380 --> 02:32:19,471
Well,

6348
02:32:19,471 --> 02:32:20,051
this is a massive,

6349
02:32:20,051 --> 02:32:20,241
massive,

6350
02:32:20,241 --> 02:32:20,980
fascinating,

6351
02:32:20,980 --> 02:32:21,900
this has been fascinating.

6352
02:32:21,901 --> 02:32:22,890
You guys are good company.

6353
02:32:22,920 --> 02:32:24,270
This is really a lovely place.

6354
02:32:24,300 --> 02:32:24,560
Tom,

6355
02:32:24,560 --> 02:32:25,440
you'd like to do this again.

6356
02:32:25,520 --> 02:32:26,250
We do it.

6357
02:32:26,250 --> 02:32:29,100
You have your way just
to say this right now,

6358
02:32:29,101 --> 02:32:31,500
but you guys are like on
it and this is a much,

6359
02:32:31,890 --> 02:32:32,723
uh,

6360
02:32:32,830 --> 02:32:34,400
like I was on my toes this whole time.

6361
02:32:34,401 --> 02:32:34,590
Like,

6362
02:32:34,590 --> 02:32:35,250
you know,

6363
02:32:35,250 --> 02:32:36,740
no dummy Joe Rogan not dummy.

6364
02:32:36,830 --> 02:32:37,300
Thank you.

6365
02:32:37,300 --> 02:32:38,190
I'm glad you had a good time.

6366
02:32:38,210 --> 02:32:38,441
Uh,

6367
02:32:38,441 --> 02:32:39,990
if you want to take mushrooms in,

6368
02:32:39,991 --> 02:32:41,900
hanging out with Brian and a dolphin tale

6369
02:32:44,160 --> 02:32:46,000
experiments going on like that,

6370
02:32:46,001 --> 02:32:46,291
because I,

6371
02:32:46,291 --> 02:32:47,250
if I had a dolphin,

6372
02:32:47,280 --> 02:32:48,660
I would be doing weird things.

6373
02:32:48,690 --> 02:32:49,470
There's two,

6374
02:32:49,470 --> 02:32:52,260
two researchers who could compare
notes and come up with the,

6375
02:32:52,320 --> 02:32:52,650
you know,

6376
02:32:52,650 --> 02:32:53,483
something like that.

6377
02:32:54,060 --> 02:32:55,320
You should read Lilly Bell,

6378
02:32:56,010 --> 02:32:56,670
John Lilly stuff.

6379
02:32:56,670 --> 02:32:58,740
He was a pioneer and
interspecies communication.

6380
02:32:58,741 --> 02:32:59,580
He actually like,

6381
02:32:59,610 --> 02:33:00,000
you know,

6382
02:33:00,000 --> 02:33:04,140
peer reviewed stuff on
Dolphin intelligence because
of psychedelics and and

6383
02:33:04,141 --> 02:33:06,540
getting a dolphin tanks or
getting an isolation tank.

6384
02:33:06,750 --> 02:33:10,440
You need to take an isolation tank trip
to man did all this crazy poopooing of

6385
02:33:10,441 --> 02:33:11,260
it without any person.

6386
02:33:11,260 --> 02:33:11,960
That's,

6387
02:33:11,960 --> 02:33:12,641
I'm just saying that,

6388
02:33:12,641 --> 02:33:15,960
that I'm sure it doesn't work on some
people because I've had people tell me I

6389
02:33:15,961 --> 02:33:16,570
didn't work on it.

6390
02:33:16,570 --> 02:33:17,970
That word and it doesn't work

6391
02:33:18,020 --> 02:33:19,290
is like saying,

6392
02:33:19,320 --> 02:33:20,153
you know,

6393
02:33:20,190 --> 02:33:23,310
I have a computer and I don't
know how to get on the Internet.

6394
02:33:23,340 --> 02:33:23,811
Well I think like,

6395
02:33:23,811 --> 02:33:24,030
you know,

6396
02:33:24,030 --> 02:33:27,690
don't know how to use minds are just too
active to slow down to the point where

6397
02:33:27,691 --> 02:33:29,550
that would be helpful for them.

6398
02:33:29,551 --> 02:33:29,910
Like they're,

6399
02:33:29,910 --> 02:33:30,280
you know,

6400
02:33:30,280 --> 02:33:32,000
almost add p I agree.

6401
02:33:32,100 --> 02:33:35,030
I agree with what you
said except the word too.

6402
02:33:35,130 --> 02:33:35,550
I don't,

6403
02:33:35,550 --> 02:33:36,520
I don't believe that,

6404
02:33:36,521 --> 02:33:38,040
that their minds are too active.

6405
02:33:38,041 --> 02:33:39,330
I believe their minds are active.

6406
02:33:39,331 --> 02:33:40,800
I believe they don't
know how to manage that,

6407
02:33:40,830 --> 02:33:41,790
but that can be taught.

6408
02:33:42,000 --> 02:33:45,330
The amount of the emails
that I get every week,

6409
02:33:45,600 --> 02:33:48,660
the amount of Twitter messages and
Facebook messages by people that have

6410
02:33:48,661 --> 02:33:51,910
positive experiences in isolation tanks
and how much it helps them and changes

6411
02:33:51,911 --> 02:33:52,710
them.

6412
02:33:52,710 --> 02:33:53,543
Fighters,

6413
02:33:53,580 --> 02:33:55,890
a lot of fighters started
using them to meditate and to,

6414
02:33:55,910 --> 02:33:56,060
to,

6415
02:33:56,060 --> 02:33:57,450
to practice relaxing.

6416
02:33:57,780 --> 02:33:58,051
Plus,

6417
02:33:58,051 --> 02:33:59,580
it's an awesome source of magnesium.

6418
02:33:59,700 --> 02:34:00,540
You just need to do it.

6419
02:34:00,541 --> 02:34:00,691
Me,

6420
02:34:00,691 --> 02:34:01,021
dude.

6421
02:34:01,021 --> 02:34:01,890
I mean it's so crazy.

6422
02:34:01,891 --> 02:34:02,181
You haven't,

6423
02:34:02,181 --> 02:34:02,420
yeah,

6424
02:34:02,420 --> 02:34:02,520
no,

6425
02:34:02,520 --> 02:34:03,720
it's not like you're busy all day.

6426
02:34:04,050 --> 02:34:05,310
What does that destroy hat?

6427
02:34:05,340 --> 02:34:06,450
What does that destroy?

6428
02:34:08,070 --> 02:34:10,080
What does that on the hat did on a rocket?

6429
02:34:10,081 --> 02:34:13,680
I think it's the red skull
or a seat on a rocket.

6430
02:34:13,820 --> 02:34:15,090
That's fucking bad ass.

6431
02:34:15,110 --> 02:34:15,943
Where'd you get that?

6432
02:34:16,230 --> 02:34:17,360
San Diego harmful.

6433
02:34:17,510 --> 02:34:18,090
San Diego.

6434
02:34:18,090 --> 02:34:18,570
San Diego.

6435
02:34:18,570 --> 02:34:18,901
Awesome.

6436
02:34:18,901 --> 02:34:19,240
Isn't it?

6437
02:34:19,240 --> 02:34:22,260
I would almost moved there if
it wasn't for the military.

6438
02:34:22,290 --> 02:34:22,900
Uh,

6439
02:34:22,900 --> 02:34:23,590
like presence,

6440
02:34:23,590 --> 02:34:26,460
presence in like the
people are all ex military,

6441
02:34:26,461 --> 02:34:29,220
so everybody acts like crazy.

6442
02:34:29,250 --> 02:34:31,260
Like the bouncers of every bar.

6443
02:34:31,290 --> 02:34:33,180
So much more strict and intense.

6444
02:34:33,630 --> 02:34:36,450
Like this woman came up to me and I
was smoking a cigarette and she goes,

6445
02:34:36,480 --> 02:34:37,350
are you smoking pot?

6446
02:34:37,440 --> 02:34:37,800
And I'm like,

6447
02:34:37,800 --> 02:34:38,400
no,

6448
02:34:38,400 --> 02:34:39,180
this is a cigarette.

6449
02:34:39,180 --> 02:34:39,720
She goes,

6450
02:34:39,720 --> 02:34:40,553
let me see that.

6451
02:34:40,560 --> 02:34:41,370
Okay.

6452
02:34:41,370 --> 02:34:42,410
And just walked away and I'm like,

6453
02:34:42,780 --> 02:34:43,471
fuck no.

6454
02:34:43,471 --> 02:34:44,304
I had no idea what she,

6455
02:34:44,810 --> 02:34:45,330
yeah,

6456
02:34:45,330 --> 02:34:45,601
she was.

6457
02:34:45,601 --> 02:34:47,370
You could tell she was
military chick though.

6458
02:34:47,790 --> 02:34:48,990
And then it was just like,

6459
02:34:48,991 --> 02:34:50,400
that was everywhere I went.

6460
02:34:50,401 --> 02:34:51,091
It felt like that.

6461
02:34:51,091 --> 02:34:51,660
And then,

6462
02:34:51,660 --> 02:34:52,020
and then,

6463
02:34:52,020 --> 02:34:52,351
I don't know,

6464
02:34:52,351 --> 02:34:52,800
it just,

6465
02:34:52,800 --> 02:34:53,633
it just felt

6466
02:34:54,240 --> 02:34:55,073
sit,

6467
02:34:55,080 --> 02:34:56,200
sat town.

6468
02:34:56,240 --> 02:34:58,650
That's without a doubt of side
effect of a military area.

6469
02:34:58,680 --> 02:35:00,330
If I could live near mission bay,

6470
02:35:00,360 --> 02:35:03,270
I tell you that he's the most
beautiful area and in the seat,

6471
02:35:03,271 --> 02:35:04,290
what does that sea lions,

6472
02:35:04,380 --> 02:35:08,940
there's retarded animals of the night
that just go like listening to that is

6473
02:35:08,941 --> 02:35:10,890
some of the funniest shit ever

6474
02:35:11,460 --> 02:35:12,031
out of nowhere.

6475
02:35:12,031 --> 02:35:12,960
That one would just quote.

6476
02:35:13,050 --> 02:35:14,370
Oh

6477
02:35:16,140 --> 02:35:16,711
by the way,

6478
02:35:16,711 --> 02:35:18,330
that's also what attracts sharks.

6479
02:35:18,390 --> 02:35:19,200
Oh really?

6480
02:35:19,200 --> 02:35:20,880
Sharks love to eat the
fuck out of those things.

6481
02:35:20,881 --> 02:35:21,990
I feel bad for those guys.

6482
02:35:21,991 --> 02:35:24,570
They're just like a big fat retards
that live in these popsicles.

6483
02:35:24,571 --> 02:35:25,404
Right.

6484
02:35:25,670 --> 02:35:26,850
So delicious.

6485
02:35:26,851 --> 02:35:28,050
To tie what they're there for.

6486
02:35:28,110 --> 02:35:28,531
I mean,

6487
02:35:28,531 --> 02:35:29,400
what else are they doing?

6488
02:35:29,401 --> 02:35:32,770
They're providing food to sharks
looking up in the sky like,

6489
02:35:33,310 --> 02:35:33,960
yeah,

6490
02:35:33,960 --> 02:35:38,160
you ever saw these for it for Walrus
that polar bears run up to and they can't

6491
02:35:38,161 --> 02:35:38,560
get away.

6492
02:35:38,560 --> 02:35:39,780
They're there on the ground.

6493
02:35:40,080 --> 02:35:40,980
Why can't they get away?

6494
02:35:40,981 --> 02:35:42,240
Because nature doesn't
want you to get away.

6495
02:35:42,241 --> 02:35:45,900
Domain meet Sicko feed this big guy.

6496
02:35:48,220 --> 02:35:48,901
Well listen man,

6497
02:35:48,901 --> 02:35:49,734
thank you very much.

6498
02:35:49,920 --> 02:35:50,940
Really appreciate this.

6499
02:35:50,941 --> 02:35:52,940
I'm so glad we did this
and let's do it again.

6500
02:35:52,980 --> 02:35:53,610
That sounds great.

6501
02:35:53,610 --> 02:35:54,241
And uh,

6502
02:35:54,241 --> 02:35:56,520
you could follow Jacob on Twitter.

6503
02:35:56,550 --> 02:35:57,660
What is your Twitter handle?

6504
02:35:57,661 --> 02:35:59,100
You got to punch out an underscore.

6505
02:35:59,160 --> 02:36:00,480
I was showing I was late.

6506
02:36:00,481 --> 02:36:00,991
I'm sorry.

6507
02:36:00,991 --> 02:36:01,710
So anyway,

6508
02:36:01,710 --> 02:36:03,050
it's underscored Jacob Ward.

6509
02:36:03,051 --> 02:36:04,430

It's underscore Jacob Ward underscore.

6513
02:36:11,690 --> 02:36:12,523
Sorry.

6514
02:36:12,680 --> 02:36:13,530
You need to change that.

6515
02:36:13,531 --> 02:36:14,970
I don't say it out loud ever.

6516
02:36:15,060 --> 02:36:17,290
I would say this is the only time
I've ever had to say it out loud.

6517
02:36:17,291 --> 02:36:18,380
It's just like easy to find.

6518
02:36:19,080 --> 02:36:20,220
Go Jacob Ward it.

6519
02:36:20,260 --> 02:36:21,660
Just look for my name on Google.

6520
02:36:21,661 --> 02:36:24,810
You'll find you have a little a check
next to your name so everybody knows the

6521
02:36:24,811 --> 02:36:25,950
real you or you verified.

6522
02:36:25,951 --> 02:36:26,470
No you're not.

6523
02:36:26,470 --> 02:36:28,820
Oh I didn't even know about that.

6524
02:36:28,830 --> 02:36:29,581
I haven't even done that.

6525
02:36:29,581 --> 02:36:30,031
I'm sorry.

6526
02:36:30,031 --> 02:36:30,330
Yeah.

6527
02:36:30,330 --> 02:36:31,163
Once you get,

6528
02:36:31,290 --> 02:36:34,400
you got to get into that
world of fake Jacob Wards got,

6529
02:36:34,600 --> 02:36:37,800
I've got to get verified cause a bunch
of people are going to have fake Jacob

6530
02:36:37,800 --> 02:36:42,800
Ward accounts and post a
bunch of nonscientific shit
and attributed to you that

6531
02:36:43,201 --> 02:36:44,034
could happen.

6532
02:36:44,300 --> 02:36:47,960
Sucks Joe is that I don't have it and I
have a bunch of fakes that are actually

6533
02:36:47,961 --> 02:36:51,590
acting like me and stuff like that and
I just found out there's this guy that's

6534
02:36:51,591 --> 02:36:56,591
on Twitter that has like 2000 Twitter
followers and his name is like spilled bag

6535
02:36:56,991 --> 02:36:59,690
of ice and and he's terrified.

6536
02:37:00,890 --> 02:37:02,570
He's verifying a bag of ice.

6537
02:37:02,571 --> 02:37:03,260
Let me show you.

6538
02:37:03,260 --> 02:37:04,700
I know that account because you do,

6539
02:37:04,701 --> 02:37:06,370
you know it's built bag of ice came from,

6540
02:37:06,890 --> 02:37:11,890
came from a UFC fight where a bag of ice
build in the octagon and I gave a whole

6541
02:37:12,321 --> 02:37:16,060
commentary for like three minutes
on these guys up the ice because it

6542
02:37:16,060 --> 02:37:17,050
was so ridiculous.

6543
02:37:17,410 --> 02:37:17,831
And I was like,

6544
02:37:17,831 --> 02:37:18,610
get back in there.

6545
02:37:18,610 --> 02:37:20,020
And it was funny.

6546
02:37:20,021 --> 02:37:23,590
And so this guy became spilled bag of
ice and he's verified and he's verified.

6547
02:37:23,620 --> 02:37:25,180
That's the Internet telling
you to go fuck yourself.

6548
02:37:25,450 --> 02:37:27,620
I'm done listen and wipie yet.

6549
02:37:27,621 --> 02:37:28,260
But he's been,

6550
02:37:28,260 --> 02:37:31,030
he's got a Wikipedia page
two I'm escaping live at.

6551
02:37:31,031 --> 02:37:33,670
Dolphins can tell you how to get verified.

6552
02:37:33,671 --> 02:37:34,390
I'm sure there's,

6553
02:37:34,390 --> 02:37:36,160
there's a convenient way to do it.

6554
02:37:36,161 --> 02:37:38,440
You just hit it to find
that it's supposed to be,

6555
02:37:38,441 --> 02:37:38,951
if people,

6556
02:37:38,951 --> 02:37:41,060
if there's enough people that
are acting like you and there,

6557
02:37:41,160 --> 02:37:41,951
there's so many people,

6558
02:37:41,951 --> 02:37:42,970
like even like,

6559
02:37:42,971 --> 02:37:47,650
I don't want even to say who I know is
acting like me online and people are

6560
02:37:47,651 --> 02:37:49,630
actually asking him questions like,

6561
02:37:49,631 --> 02:37:50,290
Hey Robin,

6562
02:37:50,290 --> 02:37:50,800
what's going on?

6563
02:37:50,800 --> 02:37:51,790
Talking about that crazy dude.

6564
02:37:51,791 --> 02:37:51,891
Yeah,

6565
02:37:51,891 --> 02:37:52,310
yeah,

6566
02:37:52,310 --> 02:37:52,660
yeah,

6567
02:37:52,660 --> 02:37:53,470

6568
02:37:53,470 --> 02:37:53,900
yeah.

6569
02:37:53,900 --> 02:37:54,400
Okay.

6570
02:37:54,400 --> 02:37:54,671
Yeah,

6571
02:37:54,671 --> 02:37:55,630
I wouldn't be surprised.

6572
02:37:55,631 --> 02:37:56,050
Yeah,

6573
02:37:56,050 --> 02:37:56,631
but you know,

6574
02:37:56,631 --> 02:37:57,910
what do you have the most right?

6575
02:37:58,000 --> 02:37:58,630
Huh?

6576
02:37:58,630 --> 02:37:59,463
How many?

6577
02:38:00,130 --> 02:38:03,400
There's at least two people maybe
that are thinking this is him.

6578
02:38:03,970 --> 02:38:05,170
Maybe that's what this is.

6579
02:38:05,171 --> 02:38:07,180
I think you've made it and you've
got people pretending to be you.

6580
02:38:07,630 --> 02:38:08,500
Check mark.

6581
02:38:08,680 --> 02:38:09,040
Yeah.

6582
02:38:09,040 --> 02:38:09,611
He just wants,

6583
02:38:09,611 --> 02:38:11,710
he wants a Wikipedia page
and the blue check mark.

6584
02:38:11,711 --> 02:38:13,210
The kids are legitimate and he's hurting.

6585
02:38:13,360 --> 02:38:14,350
It's hurting on the inside.

6586
02:38:14,710 --> 02:38:16,240
