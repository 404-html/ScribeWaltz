1
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:07,090
Firing.

2
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:09,370
The kid said,

3
00:00:09,371 --> 00:00:12,180
sans kid friendly shops here.

4
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:13,630
It's the kiss as a kid,

5
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:14,560
we know.

6
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:16,210
We don't know.

7
00:00:16,211 --> 00:00:17,560
We're not mad at Brian Cowen.

8
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:18,251
We Love Brian.

9
00:00:18,251 --> 00:00:18,491
Count.

10
00:00:18,491 --> 00:00:19,870
Brian counts just in New York working.

11
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:20,830
Uh,

12
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:22,300
so save at Twitter trolls.

13
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:22,841
Save it.

14
00:00:22,841 --> 00:00:23,430
Settle down.

15
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:25,000
Something must have at uh,

16
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:27,430
Eddie Bravo hedge surprise here.

17
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:30,250
No Eddie Bravo and Brendan shop
or not upset at each other.

18
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,113
Stop it.

19
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:31,901
Stop at Twitter.

20
00:00:31,901 --> 00:00:32,734
Tolls.

21
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,750
Twitter trolls are fucking crazy.

22
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,370
Try so hard at each other.

23
00:00:36,371 --> 00:00:37,780
Look at the way they look at each other.

24
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:40,000
I saw the way he looked
at him when he said that.

25
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:42,543
Like,

26
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:43,523
how's your son?

27
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:50,230
Shout out the love of our lives.

28
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,550
Real off camera.

29
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:52,960
I hate each other.

30
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:55,150
Shout out to the Colorado
Springs Fire Department.

31
00:00:55,151 --> 00:00:56,110
Donald Cowboy Cerrone,

32
00:00:56,111 --> 00:00:57,190
his dad gave me this shirt.

33
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:58,320
Sick cowboy.

34
00:00:58,321 --> 00:01:01,570
His Dad works for the Colorado
Springs Fire Department,

35
00:01:01,571 --> 00:01:03,800
Colorado to the show.

36
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:09,160
I think it feels like you're
trying to take Joe away road.

37
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:09,671
I mean,

38
00:01:09,671 --> 00:01:10,490
it feels,

39
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:12,280
it feels like that to me.

40
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,400
I don't want to talk about it.

41
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:18,040
And they're like high school where
your new friend get the friend.

42
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:18,963
Yeah.

43
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:20,730
He's tried to take it in front of him.

44
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:25,060
That becomes a real issue with
people for grown men sometimes,

45
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:25,930
bro.

46
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:26,231
I mean,

47
00:01:26,231 --> 00:01:27,730
you're hanging around
with him all the time.

48
00:01:27,731 --> 00:01:27,941
I mean,

49
00:01:27,941 --> 00:01:28,774
I just wonder,

50
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:29,680
I wonder Bro,

51
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,461
what the fuck is going on?

52
00:01:30,461 --> 00:01:30,750
I mean,

53
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:31,300
we're just,

54
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:32,470
what's happening with our friendship,

55
00:01:32,471 --> 00:01:32,830
man.

56
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:35,950
I've had this conversation
recently with a older friend.

57
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,290
Oh no need.

58
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:38,770
Oh,

59
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:40,750
it's also when dudes get older and shit,

60
00:01:40,751 --> 00:01:42,250
shit gets stale in their life.

61
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,120
You know,

62
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,650
people start getting real desperate.

63
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,610
They get real weird.

64
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:46,151
If you,

65
00:01:46,151 --> 00:01:48,400
if you know a dude who has a
job but he doesn't enjoy it.

66
00:01:48,401 --> 00:01:51,100
He's been doing it for a long time and
he's in a relationship is not real whole

67
00:01:51,101 --> 00:01:53,020
lot of fun and you know,

68
00:01:53,021 --> 00:01:54,580
you stop hanging around
with them a little bit.

69
00:01:54,581 --> 00:01:54,821
It's like,

70
00:01:54,821 --> 00:01:55,510
oh my God,

71
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:56,560
everything's going dark.

72
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:57,160
Yeah man,

73
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:57,971
everything's going dark.

74
00:01:57,971 --> 00:01:58,600
Where's the fun?

75
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,590
Where's the fucking fun?

76
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:00,700
Where's the blood?

77
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,510
There's no fun.

78
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:02,161
Can't hang out.

79
00:02:02,161 --> 00:02:04,600
It seems like nowadays with Instagram,

80
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:07,240
the way it's set up in Facebook,

81
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,930
you can't fucking talk as much shit
as you could like eight years ago.

82
00:02:10,931 --> 00:02:12,400
On the Internet when it was like,

83
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:13,190
it was like,

84
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:15,430
it was cool to have like
some stupid screen name,

85
00:02:15,431 --> 00:02:16,360
like you know,

86
00:02:16,361 --> 00:02:19,750
red dog two 83 or something like
that and you're just anonymous.

87
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:22,390
There's still some of that
like on the underground,

88
00:02:22,391 --> 00:02:22,541
you know,

89
00:02:22,541 --> 00:02:23,580
a lot of anonymous dudes,

90
00:02:23,581 --> 00:02:24,710
they're there like secret.

91
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,860
You see there's sort of anonymous,

92
00:02:26,861 --> 00:02:30,080
but the problem is their Ip
addresses are known like you.

93
00:02:30,081 --> 00:02:31,990
Not really that it's your only anonymous.

94
00:02:31,991 --> 00:02:33,040
If someone doesn't look,

95
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:34,840
no one's anonymous anymore.

96
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:35,840
If you're posting things,

97
00:02:35,841 --> 00:02:35,931
hey,

98
00:02:35,931 --> 00:02:36,850
you might think you are,

99
00:02:36,851 --> 00:02:39,520
but even if you're going
behind a couple of proxies,

100
00:02:39,521 --> 00:02:39,931
it's just,

101
00:02:39,931 --> 00:02:41,230
it's not hard to find you.

102
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,611
It's a weird world.

103
00:02:42,611 --> 00:02:47,070
There was a guy that was a troll on
Reddit's a famous story because he was a

104
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,310
like a real nasty guy.

105
00:02:48,311 --> 00:02:50,530
Apparently they found out where he worked.

106
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,640
These people went after him.

107
00:02:51,641 --> 00:02:52,660
They found out where he worked,

108
00:02:52,661 --> 00:02:55,120
they found out who the guy
is and they got him fired,

109
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,340
fired from his job because his,

110
00:02:57,490 --> 00:02:58,540
his fun shit.

111
00:02:58,541 --> 00:02:59,740
What he would to do is he,

112
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:00,641
you know,

113
00:03:00,641 --> 00:03:03,940
I mean if you looked at
it from a psychologic as a
psychological point of view,

114
00:03:03,941 --> 00:03:04,774
you would say,

115
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:04,991
oh,

116
00:03:04,991 --> 00:03:09,991
this guy's like all bent up and like
held back at work and he has some anger

117
00:03:10,721 --> 00:03:13,660
issues and he gets online and
through this anonymous account,

118
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:17,650
he does a lot of mean shit and it
goes after people in the morgue.

119
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:18,211
Yeah.

120
00:03:18,211 --> 00:03:18,371
Yeah.

121
00:03:18,371 --> 00:03:18,521
He,

122
00:03:18,521 --> 00:03:19,180
I think he,

123
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:21,600
I don't remember the rest
story that shoot up the place.

124
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:21,940
Yeah.

125
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:23,080
I mean who knows what level of,

126
00:03:23,081 --> 00:03:24,370
so I mean it might not,

127
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,570
that might not be the choice.

128
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,990
It might be just he's an asshole.

129
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:29,860
But my point is they found this guy,

130
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:32,110
they found this guy and they got
him fired and that's going to,

131
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:33,850
that's just like what they can do today.

132
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:37,540
Did you see that'd be able to do what
happened with a nine year old from getting

133
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:39,880
bullied at school and on
the line committed suicide.

134
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:44,140
Nine kids fucking Nice.

135
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,630
That is so crazy.

136
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:48,040
Was smart enough at nine to how
to figure out how to hang it.

137
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:48,883
So you don't want to see,

138
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:51,730
I should go after those people
instead of fucking terrorists.

139
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:52,481
That's true.

140
00:03:52,481 --> 00:03:53,320
They are terrorist.

141
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,640
I mean the hormone after some people they,

142
00:03:55,641 --> 00:03:57,370
they went after that one kid.

143
00:03:57,550 --> 00:04:02,550
There was a kid who was a roommate in
college with a kid who is gay and he knew

144
00:04:03,671 --> 00:04:04,301
his friend was gay.

145
00:04:04,301 --> 00:04:08,620
So he set up a camera and filmed
his friend having sex with a guy.

146
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:11,740
And I don't know if he blackmailed him
or said something and the guy wound up

147
00:04:11,741 --> 00:04:12,430
killing himself.

148
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:14,320
So now he's on trial for,

149
00:04:14,321 --> 00:04:15,154
I think,

150
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:16,240
I don't know what they're saying.

151
00:04:16,241 --> 00:04:18,030
Manslaughter may be or new shit.

152
00:04:18,031 --> 00:04:19,000
Some something,

153
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,230
something awful.

154
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:23,710
There was a similar case
where this girl was,

155
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,553
uh,

156
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:27,610
that she knew her friend
was like manic depressive,

157
00:04:27,611 --> 00:04:28,980
bipolar and she,

158
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:31,120
and he would reach out to for
like help and she was like,

159
00:04:31,121 --> 00:04:32,260
you just need to kill yourself,

160
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:33,873
kill yourself.

161
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,410
And then they have all this,

162
00:04:35,411 --> 00:04:39,940
the texting history and then she
would send them links on how to do it.

163
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:41,230
And then he finally did it.

164
00:04:41,231 --> 00:04:42,310
And he texted goes,

165
00:04:42,311 --> 00:04:43,300
I think it would do it tomorrow night.

166
00:04:43,301 --> 00:04:43,720
She goes,

167
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,800
you're so full of shit.

168
00:04:44,801 --> 00:04:45,760
You're not going to do it.

169
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:46,721
Let me know if you do.

170
00:04:46,721 --> 00:04:47,620
And they end up doing it.

171
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:49,960
So now she's being charged
with it and she's really young.

172
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:51,460
And here's the problem with that.

173
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:52,570
When you're real young,

174
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:53,500
first of all,

175
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:56,560
they say your brain isn't
even really fully formed.

176
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,580
It doesn't even like your,

177
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:02,230
your thoughts don't come and like the
most logical manner until you're like deep

178
00:05:02,231 --> 00:05:04,440
into your twenties I think they say your,

179
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,280
your frontal cortex is,

180
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,370
I probably shouldn't be talking
at all about like science,

181
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:11,950
but I think what the term was about,

182
00:05:11,951 --> 00:05:14,470
it was about decision making
and impulsive decision making,

183
00:05:14,471 --> 00:05:17,110
particularly in young
men experiencing texts.

184
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:18,760
Testosterone for the first time.

185
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:19,713
Thinking about this,

186
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,770
think about you're young,

187
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,101
right?

188
00:05:21,101 --> 00:05:24,060
You're experiencing testosterone
when you're 1314 years old.

189
00:05:24,061 --> 00:05:26,230
So you've got 13 years of confusing life.

190
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:28,400
All of a sudden you got raging boner.

191
00:05:28,401 --> 00:05:29,400
So I'm just get sign.

192
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:33,640
And you're so baffled because
you're so horny all the time.

193
00:05:33,641 --> 00:05:33,800
And,

194
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,130
and,

195
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:35,290
and sex is everything.

196
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:36,730
It's [inaudible] TV show,

197
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:41,370
TV shows and selling cars and it's
all over the fucking little boards.

198
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:43,110
I used to jack up the covers a city,

199
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,460
those fucking girls in
the volleyball games.

200
00:05:45,461 --> 00:05:45,970
Right.

201
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:47,110
And we were talking about that.

202
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,130
We're talking about the other day,

203
00:05:48,131 --> 00:05:48,940
like how can they,

204
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:49,930
they're wearing thongs,

205
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:52,660
but the point is when you're young,

206
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:53,800
you do shit.

207
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:56,650
He might not even understand the
consequences of what you're doing.

208
00:05:56,651 --> 00:06:00,230
Like the idea that this girl knew that
this guy was going to kill himself and

209
00:06:00,231 --> 00:06:01,190
that being mean,

210
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:02,390
it was anything other than for her.

211
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:03,950
Just a fun game of being mean.

212
00:06:03,951 --> 00:06:04,880
Magnitude of it.

213
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:07,280
I don't know if you can
really say that they know.

214
00:06:07,281 --> 00:06:07,491
I mean,

215
00:06:07,491 --> 00:06:10,130
it's awful that it got done
and I'm not exonerating her,

216
00:06:10,131 --> 00:06:12,980
but I don't know if you could
really treat that person.

217
00:06:12,981 --> 00:06:17,120
Should adults and then add in head trauma
if they played football or did martial

218
00:06:17,121 --> 00:06:17,421
arts.

219
00:06:17,421 --> 00:06:18,254
So yeah.

220
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:18,770
Oh yeah.

221
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:20,750
Try playing football since you were six.

222
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:21,650
Does that you?

223
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:22,280
Yes sir.

224
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:22,700
Dude,

225
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:23,930
keep it together very well.

226
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:25,041
You'd be surprised.

227
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:26,050
When I leave the students

228
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:33,670
I get online and you see the new CTE study
that they just released as an article

229
00:06:33,771 --> 00:06:36,710
that was out today where they were
saying that it is not the amount of

230
00:06:36,711 --> 00:06:37,580
concussions,

231
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,980
it's the amount of time
you've been in the head.

232
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:42,380
So it's subconcussive trauma,

233
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:45,570
like just jabs to the face that
don't even knock you out way,

234
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:48,890
way over long periods
of time can be worse.

235
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:49,371
You know,

236
00:06:49,371 --> 00:06:53,810
here's like I was watching Hbo
boxing the other night and a when uh,

237
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:57,430
Gennady Golovkin fought
a Kell Brook Brook,

238
00:06:57,470 --> 00:06:58,190
amazing,

239
00:06:58,190 --> 00:06:59,720
amazing fight for as long as it lasted.

240
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,970
I understand why Brooks
corner threw in the towel.

241
00:07:01,971 --> 00:07:03,140
I was bummed out that they did,

242
00:07:03,141 --> 00:07:04,390
but he was going to get marked.

243
00:07:04,391 --> 00:07:07,010
Hundred percent was getting
Mercked they were smart.

244
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:07,581
They were smart.

245
00:07:07,581 --> 00:07:09,050
But I was upset because I was like,

246
00:07:09,051 --> 00:07:09,651
God damn,

247
00:07:09,651 --> 00:07:10,281
this is a good fight.

248
00:07:10,281 --> 00:07:10,900
Me Too.

249
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,050
I Kid Kell Brook is very good.

250
00:07:12,051 --> 00:07:12,620
Anyway,

251
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:17,060
point being Bernard Hopkins is doing
the commentary and I'm listening to him

252
00:07:17,061 --> 00:07:18,050
doing a commentary and I'm like,

253
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:23,200
when you see a guy who's that great of a
boxer like Bernard Hopkins and has been

254
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:27,470
involved in boxing like pretty much
his whole life and he's almost,

255
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:28,700
he might be 50 now.

256
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:33,170
He's right around right before he is 50
and the last time he fought he fought

257
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:35,210
Kovalev and got boxed up.

258
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:35,631
You know,

259
00:07:35,631 --> 00:07:39,350
it was a tough fight to watch cause
you're watching really an older Bernard

260
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:41,690
Hopkins getting hit hard by a murderer.

261
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,640
I mean Kovalev is so
good too in the world.

262
00:07:43,641 --> 00:07:44,120
Yeah.

263
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,560
But I was listening to him commentary.

264
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,450
When you listen to a guy
like that commentate,

265
00:07:47,451 --> 00:07:47,721
he like,

266
00:07:47,721 --> 00:07:49,070
well he talks pretty good now,

267
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:50,930
but what's it going to
be like in 10 years?

268
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:52,550
You know like when you,

269
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:54,410
when you hear a guy
that talks really well,

270
00:07:54,411 --> 00:07:57,020
like deep in his fifties and
sixties like George Foreman,

271
00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:58,700
like how did he pull that off?

272
00:07:58,701 --> 00:07:59,990
Some guys keep it together though,

273
00:07:59,991 --> 00:08:00,824
don't they?

274
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:04,670
Like Roy Nelson should be drooling out
of his mouth and shitting his pants.

275
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:06,783
Just

276
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:11,060
did a maximal Blanco on maximum Blanco.

277
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:12,620
Now young have got gay teen,

278
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:15,020
no son [inaudible] he switched it up.

279
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:17,210
He has the dark cells.

280
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,193
It's over.

281
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:21,681
He's out,

282
00:08:21,681 --> 00:08:22,101
he's out,

283
00:08:22,101 --> 00:08:22,880
he's out,

284
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:23,301
he's out.

285
00:08:23,301 --> 00:08:24,134
He's out son.

286
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:24,920
Oh my God.

287
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,520
Type move.

288
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,790
Heather referee not knowing he
was out right there on the edge.

289
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:28,180
Kid.

290
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,390
Sounds like Tony Ferguson.

291
00:08:29,391 --> 00:08:30,224
Right?

292
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,130
Herb.

293
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:32,750
That's her best of the world.

294
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:34,403
You know what man,

295
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:36,160
we is even an opportunity,

296
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:36,520
you know,

297
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,310
be and the angle sometimes her,

298
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:38,700
her,

299
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:41,100
I usually give the benefit of the doubt
cause he's one of the best and it's not,

300
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,690
I think he is wrong with
going out to him and John Out.

301
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:45,740
I agree with the tap.

302
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:46,250
It's you're right.

303
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:47,083
Well it's a fight.

304
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:47,660
You're right.

305
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:49,790
I agree too because going
out doesn't hurt anybody.

306
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,840
It looks like it hurts you.

307
00:08:50,841 --> 00:08:51,780
It doesn't do anything bad.

308
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:53,450
Even if you do lose some brain cells,

309
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:54,431
what are we doing?

310
00:08:54,431 --> 00:08:56,070
And we're trying to brain cells here.

311
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:56,720
It'd be nice.

312
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,870
I mean I don't,

313
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,070
that's not what this is about.

314
00:08:59,071 --> 00:09:02,190
It's about the guys who are
sacrificing their brains for us.

315
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:02,620
What's,

316
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:03,453
what's going on.

317
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,140
I like to think.

318
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:06,450
I think herb dean and
John McCarthy are equal.

319
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,010
I think they're equal at the very top,

320
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:08,910
I think to the best and that.

321
00:09:08,911 --> 00:09:09,744
What cars do you mean?

322
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:10,590
Numero uno?

323
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:11,490
Numero Uno.

324
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:13,650
As far as dealing with them personally,

325
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:17,670
when they come in the back and just
the way I felt if John McCarthy was in,

326
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,290
was working my fight.

327
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:20,490
I felt so much better.

328
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,080
This is a beautiful dark man.

329
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:27,780
He didn't quite get the guillotine so it
just perfectly because as maximum rolls

330
00:09:27,781 --> 00:09:30,690
out of the guillotine rolls right
into the dark and transition.

331
00:09:30,691 --> 00:09:31,501
It was beautiful.

332
00:09:31,501 --> 00:09:34,020
I Bet Chaz is hit that
transition a hundred times.

333
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:39,300
He just tell right away you can sell
that this was his shit and his arms are

334
00:09:39,301 --> 00:09:42,030
long and it was in deep
and he ain't going nowhere.

335
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:42,863
He's fresh.

336
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:46,400
It's over and by the look at
the guy's face to defending,

337
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:46,890
right.

338
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:47,640
He should have went.

339
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,050
I mean he,

340
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:51,180
he should have grabbed the inside of his
thigh immediately when when he put that

341
00:09:51,181 --> 00:09:51,480
on.

342
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:54,180
I would like to hear what him and herb
were just saying to each other term was

343
00:09:54,181 --> 00:09:55,890
asking him a question
about how he set that up.

344
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:56,161
See,

345
00:09:56,161 --> 00:09:57,870
Herb's are legit martial artists,

346
00:09:57,871 --> 00:09:58,081
you know,

347
00:09:58,081 --> 00:09:58,800
educated,

348
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,700
but he loves it.

349
00:09:59,701 --> 00:10:01,020
Like when he's asking there,

350
00:10:01,021 --> 00:10:01,711
he wants to know,

351
00:10:01,711 --> 00:10:02,820
look at this dude.

352
00:10:02,821 --> 00:10:05,490
They both start off cause
that's what Maxima always does.

353
00:10:05,491 --> 00:10:10,491
He got a tight perfect look how
he set it up for doom though.

354
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:11,550
Don't get it twisted.

355
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:12,031
Damn.

356
00:10:12,031 --> 00:10:12,900
That was beautiful.

357
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:13,320
Yeah.

358
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:13,951
Professional,

359
00:10:13,951 --> 00:10:14,231
right.

360
00:10:14,231 --> 00:10:15,064
They're looking at

361
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:19,270
building chill,

362
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:22,320
chill and just showed up with an
80 pound watch on how dare you.

363
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:23,730
How dare your ball so hard.

364
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:25,290
How Terry Ball.

365
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:26,670
So dairy ball so hard.

366
00:10:26,671 --> 00:10:27,750
Look at gold on gold.

367
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:29,700
That's a couple of Goldie's over.

368
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:30,990
I was a girl.

369
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:33,090
I would be attracted to you
just because of that watch.

370
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:33,961
It's fancy.

371
00:10:33,961 --> 00:10:34,141
Yeah.

372
00:10:34,141 --> 00:10:35,400
I would say something about him.

373
00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:36,540
He's all tattooed up.

374
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:38,250
You look scruffy and dangerous.

375
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,900
He's got scar tissue.

376
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,250
Sky's the deal.

377
00:10:41,251 --> 00:10:41,761
Closer.

378
00:10:41,761 --> 00:10:43,330
They look at the watch and go Bam.

379
00:10:43,331 --> 00:10:44,164
That's it.

380
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:46,920
That's what you're saying.

381
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,360
I got a lot of cash patch.

382
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:50,310
He's still balling in that crazy corvette.

383
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:51,031
No,

384
00:10:51,031 --> 00:10:51,270
not,

385
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:51,840
not anymore.

386
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,673
When you driving now?

387
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:54,361
Oh,

388
00:10:54,361 --> 00:10:55,260
just a range rover.

389
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:58,510
Just safe and comfortable
motor sports though.

390
00:10:58,511 --> 00:10:59,730
It should be something else coming soon.

391
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,690
What corvette was it?

392
00:11:00,691 --> 00:11:02,360
A Z zero six counterparts.

393
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:06,060
Never mad at Czi convert to dope.

394
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:07,250
Dope car man.

395
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:08,330
Yeah,

396
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:08,490
the,

397
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:09,240
you know what man?

398
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:09,600
It's,

399
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:14,600
it's interesting to see how far they've
taken performance cars and how far they

400
00:11:14,611 --> 00:11:16,680
have left to go cause
there's nowhere left to go.

401
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,840
Like those was insane Teslas.

402
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:21,870
Then when you put them on ludicrous
mode and they're zero to 60 in like less

403
00:11:21,871 --> 00:11:22,770
than three seconds.

404
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:25,790
I don't fuck like the electric
does nothing for the very fast.

405
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,341
My Dick Goes,

406
00:11:26,341 --> 00:11:26,730
Huh?

407
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:27,563
Nah,

408
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:34,550
but you bring up fucking nasty ass split
windows sting ray or something like

409
00:11:35,011 --> 00:11:35,440
that.

410
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,273
Yes sir.

411
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:36,750
Yeah,

412
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:37,920
but what about the environment?

413
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,100
I'm sure we'll figure it
out at least of our worries.

414
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,710
I just can't believe they
haven't figured it out yet.

415
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:45,480
I just feel like there's gotta be a way,

416
00:11:45,481 --> 00:11:47,040
like I read something about China.

417
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:47,460
I might,

418
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:49,080
I don't know even know
if it was a real article,

419
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:54,260
but they had developed a thing that was
like a large and it was an air filter.

420
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:55,810
It would,

421
00:11:55,810 --> 00:12:00,100
it actually would pull the pollution
out of the city air and they build

422
00:12:00,101 --> 00:12:00,934
something,

423
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:01,610
a guy,

424
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:03,820
giant powered filter.

425
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:05,470
It's all sides of the building.

426
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:06,191
100%.

427
00:12:06,191 --> 00:12:07,024
Makes Sense.

428
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:10,240
It seems like you could
completely clean the air,

429
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,110
but then the real trick would be
to get it to run on pollution.

430
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:19,800
If you add a filter that actually use
the carbons in the air as it's fuel and

431
00:12:20,231 --> 00:12:24,250
then sucked all that shitty air
in and pumped out clean air.

432
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:27,400
There are some smart ass people
can for sure work on that.

433
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:27,651
Yeah,

434
00:12:27,651 --> 00:12:30,570
there's not enough money in
it after the scuffle problem.

435
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:34,870
The car companies like it floats
up after the last podcast we did.

436
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:37,090
I remember we were leaving
the conversation we had,

437
00:12:37,091 --> 00:12:38,410
we got into solar panels.

438
00:12:38,411 --> 00:12:39,040
Yeah,

439
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:39,873
and like I'm,

440
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:40,570
I don't,

441
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:42,580
I'm confused as to how they work.

442
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:43,690
You are super confused.

443
00:12:43,691 --> 00:12:44,524
Are there,

444
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:49,000
are there guys out there that have solar
panels and they're just completely cut

445
00:12:49,001 --> 00:12:52,000
off the grid and they're just using
all their energy is from them.

446
00:12:52,001 --> 00:12:54,970
Solar panel hundred percent seems like
every time you hear about the solar

447
00:12:54,971 --> 00:12:55,570
panels,

448
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:58,720
the way it works is you sent
the energy back to the city.

449
00:12:58,721 --> 00:12:58,930
No,

450
00:12:58,930 --> 00:12:59,080
no,

451
00:12:59,080 --> 00:12:59,221
no,

452
00:12:59,221 --> 00:12:59,640
no,

453
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,400
no,

454
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:00,610
no.

455
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:01,450
Discounted rent.

456
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:02,573
Here's the deal.

457
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:03,370
Here's the deal.

458
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:03,881
First of all,

459
00:13:03,881 --> 00:13:05,020
if you see someone who was like,

460
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:07,720
I have a friend was a
house that's in Colorado,

461
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:08,950
that's completely off the grid,

462
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:10,000
never been on the grid.

463
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:11,420
It's all solar panels,

464
00:13:11,421 --> 00:13:12,160
solar panels,

465
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:16,870
beautiful and solar panels and they have
a propane backup in case something goes

466
00:13:16,871 --> 00:13:21,140
wrong with the solar system or it goes
down that cause it gets so fucking cold,

467
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,510
it gets so cold.

468
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:27,930
Motherfucker [inaudible]
solar system shuts down.

469
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:36,641
Excuse me.

470
00:13:36,641 --> 00:13:38,150
Solar power system.

471
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:40,100
Yeah,

472
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:40,933
that's

473
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:44,830
dead on the report.

474
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:46,760
The fucking earth boiler.

475
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,510
Mars is headed

476
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:56,623
one light.

477
00:13:57,210 --> 00:13:58,043
So yeah.

478
00:13:58,150 --> 00:13:59,230
What they try to do,

479
00:13:59,231 --> 00:14:01,270
and this is what happens
most of the time in la,

480
00:14:01,271 --> 00:14:04,240
like if you see someone set
up a solar power system,

481
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:08,200
it's tricky because it's
not really independent.

482
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:10,540
You get your power from the sun,

483
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:13,120
but it pumps right back into the grid.

484
00:14:13,121 --> 00:14:14,560
Your Po connected to the grid.

485
00:14:14,561 --> 00:14:15,700
So that's what I'm talking about.

486
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:16,720
You don't have to be,

487
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:17,890
it's just cheaper.

488
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:19,980
Exactly.

489
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:21,101
Pushing,

490
00:14:21,101 --> 00:14:22,030
not pushing that they're going,

491
00:14:22,031 --> 00:14:22,630
hey,

492
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:23,060
it's,

493
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:25,630
it's like why does the city need,

494
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:28,000
oh we need some space
and we need your roof.

495
00:14:28,001 --> 00:14:28,271
You know,

496
00:14:28,271 --> 00:14:28,900
just get,

497
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:29,870
why are they to,

498
00:14:29,871 --> 00:14:32,230
you keep saying you keep saying
this and you're wrong about that.

499
00:14:32,231 --> 00:14:32,511
You keep,

500
00:14:32,511 --> 00:14:34,050
you keep using that analogy.

501
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:34,811
Listen,

502
00:14:34,811 --> 00:14:35,230
they're not,

503
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:38,160
they don't need the power from
these people that have solar power.

504
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:39,940
Now what it is,

505
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,790
what they're doing is they don't want
to disconnect from the grid because they

506
00:14:42,791 --> 00:14:43,720
don't want to lose money.

507
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:44,501
First of all,

508
00:14:44,501 --> 00:14:45,670
it's really hard.

509
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,770
It's really hard to get off that grid.

510
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,750
It's really hard to
just get on electricity.

511
00:14:49,751 --> 00:14:51,620
Callins been trying for
how many months now?

512
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:52,100
He's

513
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,330
been doing it for like four months.

514
00:14:53,331 --> 00:14:54,350
Going back and forth.

515
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:55,184
So what they do,

516
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:56,211
one foot in,

517
00:14:56,211 --> 00:14:56,841
one foot out,

518
00:14:56,841 --> 00:14:57,920
you gotta be all in.

519
00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:00,110
Well doesn't have a
contractor who's doing it.

520
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:03,980
[inaudible] you never know.

521
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:04,881
You never know.

522
00:15:04,881 --> 00:15:05,541
He's your friend.

523
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:06,374
You would know.

524
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:06,741
I mean,

525
00:15:06,741 --> 00:15:07,760
I know he's my friend too,

526
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:08,833
my friend first

527
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:10,960
though.

528
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:11,793
Right?

529
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,690
You're basically saying
I was being sarcastic.

530
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:16,510
What you're saying is you,

531
00:15:16,511 --> 00:15:19,040
you're thinking that somehow
or the grid needs the power.

532
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:20,480
That's definitely not what it is.

533
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:22,790
More expensive.

534
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,420
It's more generative when
you just get solar power.

535
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:26,931
Okay.

536
00:15:26,931 --> 00:15:27,950
You don't need this.

537
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:30,410
Just Massive Bank of batteries.

538
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,940
You don't need a lot of equipment.

539
00:15:31,941 --> 00:15:36,620
There's a lot of shit when
you go completely off the
grid so that when you cut

540
00:15:36,621 --> 00:15:37,490
your power off,

541
00:15:37,491 --> 00:15:38,750
you're not connected to anything.

542
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,400
If you cut your solar off,

543
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:44,240
you're still connected to the regular
power grid and you still get regular power

544
00:15:44,241 --> 00:15:45,350
if you're solar goes down.

545
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:48,740
It's one of the advantages that people
like about staying connected to the grid.

546
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:52,580
You say [inaudible] to the other part is
you definitely save money and get 100%

547
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,330
you get a taxi,

548
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:55,070
but you also can,

549
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:55,760
if you don't,

550
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,770
if you make more power than you use,

551
00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:00,890
it actually goes back into the
grid and you can get money from it.

552
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:01,420
Boom.

553
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:02,061
That's what it is,

554
00:16:02,061 --> 00:16:03,320
but it's not like they need it.

555
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:05,060
It's sort of an incentive.

556
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,970
It's an incentive in a way to
stay connected to the grid,

557
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:12,410
which I think for them is like a survival
technique because if everybody in

558
00:16:12,411 --> 00:16:12,951
California,

559
00:16:12,951 --> 00:16:15,530
you've got solar and if solar keeps
getting better the way everything gets

560
00:16:15,531 --> 00:16:16,100
better,

561
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:19,340
you're going to have a soul that's as
big as this fucking table and it's going

562
00:16:19,341 --> 00:16:21,200
to be able to power j Lo's house.

563
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,950
That'd be so expensive.

564
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:25,600
It has comments and that's why
people bring better and better.

565
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,990
It's just really expensive now,

566
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:29,750
but it's battery technology
needs to improve.

567
00:16:29,751 --> 00:16:30,471
There's a lot of issues.

568
00:16:30,471 --> 00:16:32,150
Elan Musk is on the ball with that shit.

569
00:16:32,151 --> 00:16:35,300
He's created these batteries
that sit on your wall.

570
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:39,590
It's hanging on the wall and there's much
smaller profile than the standard shit

571
00:16:39,591 --> 00:16:40,940
that most people have in their houses.

572
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:41,803
So what does it do?

573
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:42,231
Well,

574
00:16:42,231 --> 00:16:42,650
it's just,

575
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:46,100
they're just large batteries that store
the electricity from the solar power

576
00:16:46,101 --> 00:16:46,934
system.

577
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:48,410
You can use them.

578
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:48,860
Yeah.

579
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:49,693
And you just need,

580
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:50,621
yeah,

581
00:16:50,621 --> 00:16:51,454
you need whore.

582
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:51,810
Yeah.

583
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:52,270
The Bat.

584
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:52,670
Yeah.

585
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:53,810
It has to be collected.

586
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:54,650
It's like you,

587
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:57,320
have you ever seen those solar things
that you can use to charge your phone?

588
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:58,183
They're pretty dope.

589
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:59,053
It's like a,

590
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,160
like a laptop.

591
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:02,600
Like you open it up and you lay it,

592
00:17:02,601 --> 00:17:06,200
you can just let it sit on a rock and
it'll soak up enough energy from the sun

593
00:17:06,201 --> 00:17:06,920
to power your phone.

594
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:07,753
At the end of the day.

595
00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:09,800
If my friend who backpack heights,

596
00:17:09,801 --> 00:17:10,610
my friend Adam,

597
00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:12,290
he's actually in Montana right now,

598
00:17:12,291 --> 00:17:16,430
he uses that to send these updates
from the top of the fucking mountain.

599
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,990
That's what he's using for his power.

600
00:17:17,991 --> 00:17:20,090
He's got this solar thing
and he'd just unfold.

601
00:17:20,091 --> 00:17:21,650
Makes sense if you do all that shit.

602
00:17:21,651 --> 00:17:22,790
But if you live in La,

603
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:24,740
don't bring that shit out.

604
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:26,480
Well just charge it in your car.

605
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:28,130
But if you have a card that's yeah,

606
00:17:28,131 --> 00:17:28,690
that's probably good.

607
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:29,000
Yeah,

608
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,980
but if you're an Uber all the
time or something like that,

609
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:35,390
what if you're responsible and
can look at that book and thing?

610
00:17:35,391 --> 00:17:36,620
Just charge your cell phone.

611
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:37,250
Ah,

612
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:38,180
let me just get up it.

613
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:41,600
Fucking backpack full of solar panels.

614
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:42,261
But no,

615
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:42,951
it folds up.

616
00:17:42,951 --> 00:17:43,161
See,

617
00:17:43,161 --> 00:17:44,480
it folds up in three panels.

618
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:45,231
Collapse together.

619
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:46,280
So it's like a laptop,

620
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:48,321
iPad.

621
00:17:48,321 --> 00:17:49,880
So it's not that much
bigger than you fucking,

622
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:51,360
I'd a solar panel on the back.

623
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,171
Your goddamn damn phone.

624
00:17:52,171 --> 00:17:53,490
Just like God ain't going like that.

625
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,470
That's under Lou Fisker,

626
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:56,250
Flipkart this,

627
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:57,083
check this out.

628
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,140
Fisker.

629
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:59,160
They've got a new one.

630
00:17:59,161 --> 00:17:59,341
You know,

631
00:17:59,341 --> 00:18:01,880
they blew up and they kind of went
out of business or wanted one.

632
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:04,620
They only think it went well.

633
00:18:04,621 --> 00:18:05,100
These,

634
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,360
these apparently won't blow up.

635
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:07,800
What happened was if you
don't know the story,

636
00:18:07,801 --> 00:18:09,060
there was a hurricane came,

637
00:18:09,061 --> 00:18:12,630
all the ones around the dock in North
Carolina exploded when the water hit them.

638
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:15,030
I was about to get one too for steel.

639
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:17,550
So now they have one that has a roof.

640
00:18:17,551 --> 00:18:18,100
Check it out.

641
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:18,370
Eddie,

642
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:19,051
look behind you.

643
00:18:19,051 --> 00:18:20,160
That's a Fisker thing.

644
00:18:20,161 --> 00:18:20,730
Sick.

645
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:23,130
So the roof on these
things is solar powered.

646
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:25,890
The roof can actually power the car,

647
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:26,903
allegedly.

648
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,050
That's crazy.

649
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:28,441
Well,

650
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:30,210
in somewhere like la totally makes sense,

651
00:18:30,211 --> 00:18:30,660
right?

652
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:31,830
He just as we have so much sun,

653
00:18:31,831 --> 00:18:32,311
Phoenix,

654
00:18:32,311 --> 00:18:32,820
shit,

655
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,370
Seattle and Seattle,

656
00:18:35,371 --> 00:18:35,671
you're going to,

657
00:18:35,671 --> 00:18:39,720
you'll starve to death
and parts of the country.

658
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:40,733
You would think that,

659
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,870
I mean you could use it.

660
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,510
There's enough heat to
power everything that car.

661
00:18:45,511 --> 00:18:45,961
See,

662
00:18:45,961 --> 00:18:46,794
what does it say?

663
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:47,311
It says,

664
00:18:47,311 --> 00:18:51,870
does it say it will hold the whole car
guarantees about a mile and a half a

665
00:18:51,871 --> 00:18:53,190
propulsion per day.

666
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:58,800
So we're roof feeds the main battery
and generates about a mile and a half of

667
00:18:58,800 --> 00:18:59,101
propulsion per day.

668
00:18:59,101 --> 00:18:59,940
That ain't shit.

669
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:00,541
Yeah.

670
00:19:00,541 --> 00:19:02,400
That's a waste of my fucking time.

671
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:03,720
What does that mean

672
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:06,293
today?

673
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:07,051
Okay.

674
00:19:07,051 --> 00:19:07,431
Oh,

675
00:19:07,431 --> 00:19:08,011
this is that.

676
00:19:08,011 --> 00:19:11,940
Park your car at the airport for a week
and get home on the power of his son and

677
00:19:11,941 --> 00:19:12,460
the son.

678
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:14,700
Maybe if you live seven miles away,

679
00:19:14,701 --> 00:19:15,331
but God damn,

680
00:19:15,331 --> 00:19:16,710
you're pushing it and god,

681
00:19:16,711 --> 00:19:18,030
I mean that's just pushing us.

682
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:18,450
Yeah.

683
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:20,820
What did you hit traffic and you
see that meter going down your turn,

684
00:19:20,821 --> 00:19:21,654
your radio off.

685
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:26,730
You want that gas can right there.

686
00:19:26,731 --> 00:19:31,731
I had like gas to the old school I the
electricity is a is a fascinating future

687
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:33,961
for sure,

688
00:19:33,961 --> 00:19:36,540
but Maine early adopters that you,

689
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:40,440
you're right now you're not really
early adopter like a mid time adopter,

690
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:41,640
but it's a pain in the ass.

691
00:19:41,641 --> 00:19:42,510
When I rented one,

692
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:43,710
they don't last that long.

693
00:19:43,711 --> 00:19:44,041
Like I,

694
00:19:44,041 --> 00:19:48,630
I went to the Improv and back home and
it was more than a half of a battery.

695
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:49,860
They're just not fun either.

696
00:19:49,861 --> 00:19:51,450
Like I enjoy driving,

697
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,650
I love driving.

698
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:53,610
Let me sit in traffic.

699
00:19:53,611 --> 00:19:53,851
I don't,

700
00:19:53,851 --> 00:19:56,510
but I love driving WCH I'm like that in,

701
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:56,741
in,

702
00:19:56,741 --> 00:19:57,421
in the Tesla.

703
00:19:57,421 --> 00:19:57,930
It's just,

704
00:19:57,930 --> 00:19:58,920
it's not fun for me.

705
00:19:58,950 --> 00:19:59,970
But you had that Prius.

706
00:19:59,971 --> 00:20:03,990
Could it not be fun and I fucking would
kick it every time I got to get into it.

707
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,790
I sold that thing so fast.

708
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:06,391
All right.

709
00:20:06,391 --> 00:20:10,190
When the lease was up so they get the
shit out of my face and he did it.

710
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,630
I drove a Tesla ones.

711
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:16,040
It can't stand the hell
tried driving a real sports.

712
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:17,800
Oh yeah.

713
00:20:17,801 --> 00:20:18,250
I don't know.

714
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:18,890
Jump in that.

715
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:19,650
You're like that.

716
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:21,000
I think they're pretty bad ass.

717
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:22,470
I see Eddie's point.

718
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:23,520
Cool.

719
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,630
Finally an electric car.

720
00:20:24,631 --> 00:20:27,210
That looks cool cause like
pimps fucking drive though.

721
00:20:27,211 --> 00:20:28,044
The fiscal.

722
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:29,123
The Fisker.

723
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:32,000
Fisker looks like a Maserati or a Tesla.

724
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:33,293
Cool.

725
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:35,490
Finally they look better than a Prius.

726
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:36,680
Yeah,

727
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,111
definitely.

728
00:20:37,111 --> 00:20:38,130
They've definitely look cool.

729
00:20:38,131 --> 00:20:39,330
Like Brian's that white one.

730
00:20:39,331 --> 00:20:40,950
That looks pretty
serious of bummed me out.

731
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:42,210
Yeah Chris.

732
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:43,110
So fuck your day up.

733
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,430
It's transportation though.

734
00:20:44,431 --> 00:20:45,181
I mean that's what it is.

735
00:20:45,181 --> 00:20:45,810
It's not,

736
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:47,980
there's a difference between a vehicle

737
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:51,430
and like a that corvette that you
were driving at zero six convertible.

738
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:53,980
That thing is just a rollercoaster ride.

739
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:56,620
It's stressful to drive it to like,

740
00:20:56,970 --> 00:20:59,020
is this kind of stressful
to drive it too much power,

741
00:20:59,380 --> 00:20:59,951
too much power.

742
00:20:59,951 --> 00:21:00,970
Like the Ferrari.

743
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:04,930
I like the friary better but they're
about the same like speed wise.

744
00:21:04,931 --> 00:21:06,220
I mean they're about as fast.

745
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:10,060
You can't tell really if I raced one
or the other it'd be just as fast.

746
00:21:10,061 --> 00:21:11,350
But like the Ferrari,

747
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:12,990
the passengers terrified.

748
00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:14,950
You feel like you're in total
control and the corvette,

749
00:21:14,951 --> 00:21:15,830
you're both fucking tear.

750
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,230
You just,

751
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:19,480
you have no control and
like the ass and just go.

752
00:21:19,481 --> 00:21:23,740
It's six 50 horsepower and six
50 torque and it's fucking crazy.

753
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:27,850
Many dodge vipers when they first
came out was the first car really?

754
00:21:27,851 --> 00:21:29,010
That was on mass production.

755
00:21:29,011 --> 00:21:30,070
I was a 500 horsepower,

756
00:21:30,071 --> 00:21:32,140
500 pounds of Torque and guides.

757
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:34,360
It was just like crazy eyes off Mr deeds,

758
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:34,631
they're like,

759
00:21:34,631 --> 00:21:37,690
these things are fast and just
to run into walls and shit.

760
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:39,530
They have a new bunch stick to do.

761
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:43,810
Have you seen that new viper that they
have built just for the race track but

762
00:21:43,811 --> 00:21:45,130
you could drive it around the street.

763
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:46,540
It's insane.

764
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:47,650
It's insane.

765
00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:50,740
It is like the closest thing
you can get to a dick on wheels.

766
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,390
I was like a giant space ship date.

767
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,460
Oh they bring it up right now.

768
00:21:54,461 --> 00:21:56,920
We all get a car guy every hole.

769
00:21:56,930 --> 00:21:57,400
Pull the,

770
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,181
pull that thing up.

771
00:21:58,181 --> 00:21:59,390
Look at this thing down.

772
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:04,410
The fucking thing is so God
damn fast to 12 Donnie fast.

773
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:05,981
What years?

774
00:22:05,981 --> 00:22:06,814
That one Jamie?

775
00:22:07,670 --> 00:22:10,630
2017 it's a scary ass car too.

776
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:13,120
I want that 1993 old school,

777
00:22:13,121 --> 00:22:14,890
that 40 g's viper.

778
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:18,580
They keep taking these things to race
tracks and breaking the track record over

779
00:22:18,581 --> 00:22:19,414
and over and over again.

780
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:21,400
It's just a monstrous car,

781
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,460
but ridiculous to dry UCR.

782
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:23,920
Is that right?

783
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:24,753
Yeah,

784
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:25,801
but if she drew this,

785
00:22:25,801 --> 00:22:27,280
the SRT ACR,

786
00:22:27,281 --> 00:22:31,110
I think there's 12 or what?

787
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:31,871
I don't know what it is.

788
00:22:31,871 --> 00:22:32,704
I think it's the other ones.

789
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:35,200
12 getting away from B12 12 feet.

790
00:22:35,201 --> 00:22:37,030
10 look at the Viper.

791
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:38,530
Afford Christ.

792
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:43,590
What's for like baby has a
Ford gt best depth thing.

793
00:22:44,121 --> 00:22:44,954
It's an amazing,

794
00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:47,260
the Shelby Cobra about
you see the new one?

795
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,280
They've got a new one coming out.

796
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:48,601
No,

797
00:22:48,601 --> 00:22:49,450
I just remember the pro,

798
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:50,260
like the old one.

799
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:51,820
The Gt just looked like a door.

800
00:22:52,050 --> 00:22:53,950
It was just ugly door was goofy.

801
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:55,000
I had one of those,

802
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:55,691
I believe.

803
00:22:55,691 --> 00:22:56,524
I dig them.

804
00:22:56,570 --> 00:22:57,403
What's the,

805
00:22:57,610 --> 00:23:00,760
the Nissan Gtr,

806
00:23:00,761 --> 00:23:02,770
they have one of the
fastest cars ever accurate.

807
00:23:02,771 --> 00:23:03,371
Doesn't really have,

808
00:23:03,371 --> 00:23:04,151
they have an NSX.

809
00:23:04,151 --> 00:23:04,984
It's coming accurate.

810
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:07,590
Then sex is,

811
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:09,850
they'd make a new one,

812
00:23:09,851 --> 00:23:11,050
but it's not like the old one.

813
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:12,880
The old one was like a stick shift.

814
00:23:12,881 --> 00:23:13,661
Light car,

815
00:23:13,661 --> 00:23:14,081
aluminum.

816
00:23:14,081 --> 00:23:16,870
The new one is four
wheel drive turbo audit.

817
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:17,793
It's automatic.

818
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:19,300
The Nissan GTR though,

819
00:23:19,301 --> 00:23:19,811
at my age,

820
00:23:19,811 --> 00:23:20,680
especially your guys' age,

821
00:23:20,681 --> 00:23:22,770
you'd feel like a dick
driving cause it's like

822
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:27,820
the first time you ever gotten
high it was too much supra ish.

823
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:29,580
A little bit like if
you were in high school,

824
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:30,430
he'd be killing it.

825
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:31,090
Killing it.

826
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:32,020
Killed the GTR.

827
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:32,941
Yeah.

828
00:23:32,941 --> 00:23:33,320
Yeah.

829
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:35,590
Like sage Northcutt pulls up to the club.

830
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,520
That's his fucking car.

831
00:23:36,521 --> 00:23:37,354
That's what he's got.

832
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:38,770
Yeah.

833
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:39,431
He has a gts.

834
00:23:39,431 --> 00:23:39,981
Perfect sense.

835
00:23:39,981 --> 00:23:40,690
It's perfect.

836
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:41,380
Perfect for him.

837
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:42,210
That is has,

838
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:45,010
I can't think of a handsome
fellow with a slick rod.

839
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:47,120
It's like,

840
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:47,420
right.

841
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:48,350
Those are fun cars though,

842
00:23:48,351 --> 00:23:48,531
man.

843
00:23:48,531 --> 00:23:50,000
Who gives a fuck what anybody else thinks.

844
00:23:50,001 --> 00:23:51,720
When you show a hundred
horsepower or something,

845
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:52,640
hey listen man,

846
00:23:52,641 --> 00:23:54,770
you think people don't think you're
a Douche bag when you pull up in that

847
00:23:54,771 --> 00:23:55,910
continental gt,

848
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,600
easy Bentley Super Sport.

849
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,030
It's only 200 of them.

850
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:01,573
Big Difference.

851
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:05,330
It's a bad for what I thought when
I pulled up and parked outside,

852
00:24:05,331 --> 00:24:05,541
I was like,

853
00:24:05,541 --> 00:24:05,661
oh,

854
00:24:05,661 --> 00:24:06,560
this fucking Douche bag.

855
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:11,180
That's a dope car.

856
00:24:11,181 --> 00:24:11,560
That's it.

857
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:13,400
That's a GTR and that car is silly,

858
00:24:13,401 --> 00:24:14,000
fast,

859
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,050
stupid fast,

860
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:16,640
and they handle like a dream man.

861
00:24:16,641 --> 00:24:17,570
I rented one of those.

862
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:19,010
You could rent them from Hertz.

863
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:21,080
Hertz rent summit in Austin.

864
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:23,150
I rented one for a few
days and drove it around.

865
00:24:23,151 --> 00:24:23,984
So amazing.

866
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:24,721
Great car.

867
00:24:24,721 --> 00:24:25,460
Just not for you.

868
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:26,720
You rented the Hellcat too?

869
00:24:26,721 --> 00:24:27,110
Yeah,

870
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:29,630
we're in negative fucking awesome.

871
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:30,690
Yeah.

872
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:32,030
So ridiculous.

873
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:33,380
You laughing when you drive in it.

874
00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:36,500
Yeah.

875
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:41,500
It's got 660 something fucking
orders it 700 750 it's just crazy.

876
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,240
What do you go from there though?

877
00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:45,070
It's crazy.

878
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:46,170
Where does dodge go from there?

879
00:24:46,430 --> 00:24:47,090
Who knows?

880
00:24:47,090 --> 00:24:47,990
Well that's what we're saying.

881
00:24:47,991 --> 00:24:49,300
You know about like the,

882
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:49,680
you know,

883
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,050
the evolution of this stuff.

884
00:24:51,051 --> 00:24:51,520
It's,

885
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:51,830
it's,

886
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:55,670
they're trying to have unlimited
growth in performance cars.

887
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,790
It's going to get to
some weird place where,

888
00:24:58,820 --> 00:24:59,700
I mean it is already,

889
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:03,410
if you can go and buy one of those z I
o six is you could be an 18 year old kid

890
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:05,150
and go out and buy a corvette.

891
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:06,480
Z O six and for,

892
00:25:06,481 --> 00:25:08,260
for what that is it and don't get,

893
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:11,660
I realize that expense for
what that car's performance is,

894
00:25:11,661 --> 00:25:12,410
it's cheap.

895
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:13,740
Oh Gosh,

896
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,190
that's terrible.

897
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:15,501
Well,

898
00:25:15,501 --> 00:25:19,300
sort of affordable housing
dog car cars though.

899
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:24,660
It seems like every year
the zero to 60 gets a B.

900
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:25,260
Yeah.

901
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:26,450
What point does it stop?

902
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,041
Exactly?

903
00:25:27,041 --> 00:25:27,950
That's what we're saying.

904
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:29,840
Well the electric ones are beaten,

905
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:30,591
beaten,

906
00:25:30,591 --> 00:25:30,920
all the,

907
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,360
everything that ludicrous shit.

908
00:25:32,361 --> 00:25:33,194
They're getting nuts.

909
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:33,411
Yeah,

910
00:25:33,411 --> 00:25:34,161
they're pretty close.

911
00:25:34,161 --> 00:25:38,640
I think that the older model was
the insane button and [inaudible]

912
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:40,973
yeah.

913
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:42,980
Meatballs or whatever.

914
00:25:42,981 --> 00:25:43,814
There's going to be like,

915
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:47,230
no Chris.

916
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,260
It's a weird car,

917
00:25:48,261 --> 00:25:48,710
man.

918
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:49,700
It's a weird car.

919
00:25:49,810 --> 00:25:50,180
You know?

920
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:51,620
It's ridiculously fast.

921
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:52,663
But yeah,

922
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:55,490
going to get to get it down
to probably like one second.

923
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:57,710
I wonder if the government's
going to like step in.

924
00:25:57,711 --> 00:25:59,750
I mean they keep you
from doing certain shit.

925
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:02,390
How come they don't keep you
from driving motorcycles?

926
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:05,540
I was thinking that while I was watching
this guy zip past me on the highway

927
00:26:05,541 --> 00:26:06,374
today is

928
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:08,391
with a girl on,

929
00:26:08,391 --> 00:26:09,470
it's insane.

930
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,010
I was like,

931
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:10,843
ah,

932
00:26:10,850 --> 00:26:11,810
please don't fall.

933
00:26:11,811 --> 00:26:13,370
And just watching them
go and please don't fall.

934
00:26:13,371 --> 00:26:13,581
Just,

935
00:26:13,581 --> 00:26:14,090
just,

936
00:26:14,090 --> 00:26:16,400
I don't want to see you guys
turn it to me on the road.

937
00:26:16,401 --> 00:26:18,940
Like so insane dude on uh,

938
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:23,000
unfollow on Thursday I was in the
Beverly Hills like kills here.

939
00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:25,400
I'm coming down and I'm at the light.

940
00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:27,200
I had a long damn like God damn,

941
00:26:27,201 --> 00:26:27,951
that's a long day.

942
00:26:27,951 --> 00:26:29,780
Like feeling sorry for
myself for whatever reason.

943
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:35,140
And this fucking car is making a lefthand
turn and these young kids are paying

944
00:26:35,571 --> 00:26:35,961
attention.

945
00:26:35,961 --> 00:26:37,400
They're like talking and looking back.

946
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:38,870
Probably going 60.

947
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:39,831
I'm like go,

948
00:26:39,831 --> 00:26:40,664
this ain't good.

949
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:41,833
Good.

950
00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:43,350
The front,

951
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:43,820
the bolt,

952
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:45,930
the cars is basically ripped off engine.

953
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:46,351
I mean,

954
00:26:46,351 --> 00:26:48,090
just a complete shit show.

955
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:50,700
The kids that hit the car get out.

956
00:26:50,701 --> 00:26:51,480
They're fine.

957
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,680
Like some foreign kids,

958
00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:54,030
girls pretty hot anyways.

959
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:55,013
They get out.

960
00:26:55,430 --> 00:27:00,240
The car that they hit was like a Cadillac
cts or whatever it brand new with the

961
00:27:00,241 --> 00:27:01,074
temp tags.

962
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:02,520
An older lady gets out,

963
00:27:02,521 --> 00:27:03,240
I'm watching like,

964
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,560
what the fuck is this?

965
00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:06,300
So lady gets out and she's crying.

966
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:07,410
She goes to the side,

967
00:27:07,411 --> 00:27:08,244
they got hit,

968
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:10,590
her husband's there and
they can't get them out.

969
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:11,820
I was like an unconscious Cancun.

970
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:12,780
Not so much shit.

971
00:27:12,781 --> 00:27:13,441
I better do something.

972
00:27:13,441 --> 00:27:14,490
So I pull off the side,

973
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:16,290
I run over there,

974
00:27:16,291 --> 00:27:20,700
finally getting him out and I
look at him in his fucking grill.

975
00:27:20,701 --> 00:27:22,490
He must have hit the front and his,

976
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:23,311
his teeth,

977
00:27:23,311 --> 00:27:23,840
his lip,

978
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,530
it just blood everywhere,

979
00:27:25,531 --> 00:27:26,364
man.

980
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:27,583
Gangster.

981
00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:27,961
He's like,

982
00:27:27,961 --> 00:27:29,550
did you see what fucking happened?

983
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:30,463
Juicy.

984
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:31,740
I didn't want to be a witness.

985
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:32,820
There's a million other people.

986
00:27:32,821 --> 00:27:32,991
And like,

987
00:27:32,991 --> 00:27:33,840
I sure didn't man.

988
00:27:33,841 --> 00:27:34,674
Good luck.

989
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,790
And I called nine one one.

990
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:37,710
You didn't want to be a witness.

991
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:38,760
You know how they got,

992
00:27:38,761 --> 00:27:39,130
well,

993
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:41,550
I helped them and there's enough
people around where they can,

994
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:43,800
there's literally 50 other witnesses.

995
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:45,690
I don't know if you
should have admitted that.

996
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:47,100
Uh,

997
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:47,521
believe me,

998
00:27:47,521 --> 00:27:48,330
they had it.

999
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:49,163
They had it.

1000
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:50,130
I have to get going,

1001
00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:53,630
get home to my son now.

1002
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:54,900
No,

1003
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:59,760
they got it for sure that there was
literally 50 people around saw the same

1004
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:00,360
shit.

1005
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:04,020
They don't need fricking
my play by play on it.

1006
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:04,761
That makes sense.

1007
00:28:04,761 --> 00:28:05,880
It sounds a little better.

1008
00:28:06,370 --> 00:28:07,260
They don't.

1009
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:08,430
They're fine.

1010
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,790
There's cops everywhere.

1011
00:28:09,791 --> 00:28:10,260
They're fine.

1012
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:11,730
CSI was on that shit.

1013
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:13,350
So who's fault was it?

1014
00:28:13,351 --> 00:28:14,280
Was it the kid's fault?

1015
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:14,911
The kids?

1016
00:28:14,911 --> 00:28:15,310
Yes.

1017
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:15,840
Yeah.

1018
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:16,250
Yeah.

1019
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:17,400
Hundred percent yeah man.

1020
00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:21,870
It is amazing when you think that someone
should can give you a car when you're

1021
00:28:21,871 --> 00:28:22,770
17 years old,

1022
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:23,633
when you're,

1023
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:24,690
I remember being,

1024
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:24,871
well,

1025
00:28:24,871 --> 00:28:27,360
I got a bunch of car accidents
when I was having too bad,

1026
00:28:27,361 --> 00:28:29,420
but I was so stupid.

1027
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:30,930
I was so dumb.

1028
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:34,230
I was so dumb and completely reckless.

1029
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:39,260
And the idea that someone just gave me
a 2000 pound plus thing with an engine

1030
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:42,040
and not smash ball.

1031
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:47,790
He's barely know how to fucking pay
attention to the breaks and the oil.

1032
00:28:47,791 --> 00:28:48,690
And you're barely,

1033
00:28:48,691 --> 00:28:49,500
and you're,

1034
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:53,490
you're a part of this now at cell phones
into the mixed kids are addicted to

1035
00:28:53,491 --> 00:28:57,150
cell phones and do a triangle
Twitter and all that shit.

1036
00:28:57,870 --> 00:28:59,520
Just got to shift a little to the right,

1037
00:28:59,521 --> 00:29:00,510
my friend.

1038
00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:02,700
Good Stat to scoop that hip out.

1039
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:04,200
Readjust.

1040
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:06,283
Hmm.

1041
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:06,720
Nope.

1042
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,280
Nope.

1043
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:07,491
Oh,

1044
00:29:07,491 --> 00:29:08,311
good stacking hay.

1045
00:29:08,311 --> 00:29:09,210
Do you Eddie,

1046
00:29:09,211 --> 00:29:10,380
do you still do the TP?

1047
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,390
Is that still a legit damn,

1048
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:13,613
remember the teepee?

1049
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:14,370
Yes.

1050
00:29:14,370 --> 00:29:15,780
It's still totally legit.

1051
00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:16,590
It is right.

1052
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:17,400
I just don't,

1053
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,181
haven't gone to it.

1054
00:29:18,181 --> 00:29:20,070
And you gotta be kind
of fresh to pull it off.

1055
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,830
It all depends on where
your opponent's hands are.

1056
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:24,330
Generally guys,

1057
00:29:24,331 --> 00:29:25,164
uh,

1058
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:27,570
you know,

1059
00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:28,860
I have their hands up here.

1060
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:33,690
Did see is like a triangle variation
where you reached behind the knees with a

1061
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:34,370
escrip,

1062
00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:34,730
right?

1063
00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:35,563
It was a escrip.

1064
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:38,490
It's like this instead of just
don't have to be fully closed.

1065
00:29:38,491 --> 00:29:38,881
What you say.

1066
00:29:38,881 --> 00:29:40,920
You don't have to be fully close to
actually go all the way up to the,

1067
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:42,160
and he's wrapping

1068
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:45,880
his arm around your legs that you really
cannot just so then you just go here,

1069
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:48,670
go around and it's tight.

1070
00:29:48,671 --> 00:29:49,504
Now.

1071
00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:51,190
Do you want to sleep with that shit?

1072
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:52,380
It works well.

1073
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,140
This guys,

1074
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:54,070
this guy is doomed.

1075
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:54,963
Yeah,

1076
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:56,330
but he's got,

1077
00:29:56,330 --> 00:29:56,951
he's got to pull.

1078
00:29:56,951 --> 00:29:58,740
This all has to do is keep.

1079
00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:01,600
This guy's going to keep
throwing punches at him.

1080
00:30:01,601 --> 00:30:03,640
You got a block isn't
he's going to go out?

1081
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:04,493
Yeah.

1082
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:05,650
That shit is terrible.

1083
00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:08,100
Oh,

1084
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:08,550
it's old.

1085
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:09,383
He's in trouble.

1086
00:30:13,910 --> 00:30:14,790
He's about to test ride.

1087
00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:15,511
This guy is tough.

1088
00:30:15,511 --> 00:30:16,040
It's tough arc,

1089
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:18,220
but as some good he's adjusting.

1090
00:30:18,290 --> 00:30:18,910
Nah,

1091
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:19,481
he lost it.

1092
00:30:19,481 --> 00:30:20,020
He lost it.

1093
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:20,853
Wow.

1094
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:22,780
Stacking right there.

1095
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:23,021
Yeah,

1096
00:30:23,021 --> 00:30:23,854
it really is.

1097
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,090
But he doesn't have it anymore.

1098
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:25,730
Nope.

1099
00:30:25,730 --> 00:30:26,500
He's out.

1100
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:27,850
Can I help him with the shoulder?

1101
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:29,680
The cage is helping them to,

1102
00:30:29,770 --> 00:30:30,603
God dammit.

1103
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:32,463
Endurance.

1104
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:33,910
So much of a factor.

1105
00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:34,660
You know,

1106
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:37,030
I'm starting to listen to
nick curse on shilling.

1107
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:37,401
I know you.

1108
00:30:37,401 --> 00:30:38,320
You're training with him.

1109
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:39,011
I'm sorry.

1110
00:30:39,011 --> 00:30:40,300
I listened to him more and more.

1111
00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:42,250
And one of the things that
he said that I was like,

1112
00:30:42,251 --> 00:30:42,491
wow,

1113
00:30:42,491 --> 00:30:44,020
that's such a controversial thing to say.

1114
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:44,591
He's like,

1115
00:30:44,591 --> 00:30:47,470
when you're in camp for a fight you
should be doing all strength and

1116
00:30:47,471 --> 00:30:48,190
conditioning.

1117
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:48,431
He goes,

1118
00:30:48,431 --> 00:30:49,300
you already know how to fight.

1119
00:30:49,810 --> 00:30:50,141
He's like,

1120
00:30:50,141 --> 00:30:53,410
you should be literally concentrating
almost entirely on your gas tank.

1121
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:54,161
I was like,

1122
00:30:54,161 --> 00:30:54,994
wow.

1123
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:58,690
Like think about that like
skill work up until fight camp,

1124
00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:00,010
preparing for fight camp.

1125
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:02,080
How long has your mass of
strength and conditioning,

1126
00:31:02,410 --> 00:31:05,180
how long would the Kashi
in his book shut that too.

1127
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:05,830
And I never,

1128
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:07,000
I never understood it really.

1129
00:31:07,001 --> 00:31:08,020
It was like God,

1130
00:31:08,021 --> 00:31:09,100
Jill is the most important.

1131
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:09,640
Gotcha.

1132
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,280
How's your car car Joe Carter?

1133
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:12,143
Joe?

1134
00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:14,730
I think it makes sense.

1135
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:15,810
Depends what level yet.

1136
00:31:15,850 --> 00:31:16,300
If you're,

1137
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:19,790
if your cm punk ahead and just
kind of mix everything that was,

1138
00:31:19,810 --> 00:31:20,350
that was,

1139
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:21,460
that didn't matter.

1140
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:22,420
That didn't matter.

1141
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:24,040
You know this same from experiencing,

1142
00:31:24,041 --> 00:31:24,670
cause he doesn't have,

1143
00:31:24,670 --> 00:31:24,950
you know,

1144
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:25,480
if,

1145
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:25,940
if you're,

1146
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:27,480
if you're a Joe Schilling if,

1147
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:27,851
yeah.

1148
00:31:27,851 --> 00:31:28,960
But if you're a Joe Schilling,

1149
00:31:28,961 --> 00:31:32,860
you have worldclass striking and
you're in a striking contest for sure.

1150
00:31:32,861 --> 00:31:33,581
Getting shaped,

1151
00:31:33,581 --> 00:31:36,700
cause you're not gonna learn how to throw
a jab or a right high kick any better.

1152
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:37,750
It's just repetitions,

1153
00:31:37,751 --> 00:31:37,931
right?

1154
00:31:37,931 --> 00:31:38,121
Yeah.

1155
00:31:38,121 --> 00:31:42,130
So your cardio and strength condition
makes sense if you're a young guy,

1156
00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:43,220
man,

1157
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:44,340
I disagree.

1158
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:46,150
Well I just think that that's is,

1159
00:31:47,770 --> 00:31:48,491
it's accurate,

1160
00:31:48,491 --> 00:31:49,420
but it's like he's uh,

1161
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:51,053
he's like,

1162
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:53,680
you should do nothing
but work on your Jujitsu.

1163
00:31:53,681 --> 00:31:55,210
I'm going to say you should
do anything to work on.

1164
00:31:55,211 --> 00:31:57,520
Your fucking striking
coach is going to work.

1165
00:31:57,521 --> 00:31:57,700
Like,

1166
00:31:57,700 --> 00:32:00,010
cause you're boxing coach to go in and
say you need to work on your skill,

1167
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:02,320
your strength conditioning coach
is going to say the same thing.

1168
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:06,220
And the truth is you guys work
on everything all the time.

1169
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:10,360
It's all the [inaudible] because,

1170
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:10,760
yeah.

1171
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:11,770
But here's the other thought,

1172
00:32:11,771 --> 00:32:12,550
right?

1173
00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:14,440
When you see a guy like Damien Maia,

1174
00:32:14,770 --> 00:32:19,630
it like it's a one trick pony
with one fucking amazing trick.

1175
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:21,130
His standup is pretty good,

1176
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,073
you know,

1177
00:32:23,090 --> 00:32:25,450
that's also why he's comparing for sure.

1178
00:32:25,451 --> 00:32:26,690
But it's just the wonder blood.

1179
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:26,951
His,

1180
00:32:26,951 --> 00:32:28,840
but his game is very,

1181
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:30,710
it's very obvious what he's gonna do.

1182
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:33,760
Cause it's not like he's mixing up things
you don't know he's going to high kick

1183
00:32:33,761 --> 00:32:34,121
you.

1184
00:32:34,121 --> 00:32:39,121
Or for a while there he was trying to
kick ass and then he changed his whole,

1185
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,450
he changed the whole,

1186
00:32:41,451 --> 00:32:41,920
uh,

1187
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:42,500
uh,

1188
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:45,350
same thing with the soccer Robert
towards the end of his career.

1189
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:46,160
He,

1190
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,840
his strategy was always like,

1191
00:32:47,841 --> 00:32:50,760
I'm just going to like stand
with dudes and but maybe,

1192
00:32:50,761 --> 00:32:51,500
maybe take them down.

1193
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:52,410
Then at the end of soccer,

1194
00:32:52,411 --> 00:32:53,240
rob his career,

1195
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:53,691
he decided,

1196
00:32:53,691 --> 00:32:54,500
holy Shit,

1197
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:58,400
I'd better take dudes down and choked
them out because I've been knocked out way

1198
00:32:58,401 --> 00:32:59,060
too many times.

1199
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:01,190
But we had mine did that too.

1200
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:01,700
But,

1201
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:02,121
but if it,

1202
00:33:02,121 --> 00:33:04,460
but if my fights one Wonderboy,

1203
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:06,050
he's sure it's fucking orchestra.

1204
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:10,910
There's what we know that game plants
from both guys team got better at his

1205
00:33:10,911 --> 00:33:11,744
ground game.

1206
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:14,810
I mean he got better at is overall mixed
martial arts came once a standup got

1207
00:33:14,811 --> 00:33:16,480
good enough where it wasn't
nervous about it anymore.

1208
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:17,450
Like if you watch him fight,

1209
00:33:17,451 --> 00:33:21,200
his timing is excellent and his standup
defense is very good because he's,

1210
00:33:21,201 --> 00:33:21,400
I,

1211
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,150
he's knowledge of when he's in trouble,

1212
00:33:23,151 --> 00:33:23,890
when he's not thinking,

1213
00:33:23,890 --> 00:33:24,711
he knows who he is.

1214
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:25,250
Fine.

1215
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:29,000
And that's a big part of winning
in that part of that dusty,

1216
00:33:29,030 --> 00:33:29,300
you know,

1217
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:31,430
wanting to be a kickboxer
for a few fights.

1218
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:32,930
That attitude,

1219
00:33:32,931 --> 00:33:34,400
I think you needed to go through that.

1220
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:35,600
He needed to get through the,

1221
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:37,340
because every Jujitsu guys,

1222
00:33:37,341 --> 00:33:41,420
biggest fear standing with someone in
the octagon and having the whole world

1223
00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:42,770
watched you get knocked out.

1224
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:43,850
Then they got,

1225
00:33:43,850 --> 00:33:44,390
you know,

1226
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:47,070
generally it takes a while to get to that.

1227
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:49,250
That's where he's going to pass.

1228
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:49,610
Yeah,

1229
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:50,290
but he's a mountain.

1230
00:33:50,290 --> 00:33:51,710
Look at them hanging onto it.

1231
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:53,091
Oh yeah.

1232
00:33:53,091 --> 00:33:53,924
That's tight.

1233
00:33:57,710 --> 00:33:59,060
But it looks pretty God damn tight.

1234
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,113
He's all right.

1235
00:34:02,210 --> 00:34:02,361
Yeah.

1236
00:34:02,361 --> 00:34:03,590
He could have got that stop right there.

1237
00:34:03,591 --> 00:34:04,424
Right.

1238
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:09,550
It's hard to tell what he has member
that when fucking was it to Cada,

1239
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:11,840
lied and said that her
voice was choked out.

1240
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:14,150
Remember that shit to in line.

1241
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:15,250
Was it to cost?

1242
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:16,093
That's right.

1243
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:17,850
Was it him wasn't to,

1244
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:19,940
to Kinda is the guy who was Yoshida.

1245
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,140
Yoshida?

1246
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:22,690
No,

1247
00:34:22,690 --> 00:34:23,310
no.

1248
00:34:23,310 --> 00:34:25,120
What do you mean kind of a ship?

1249
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:25,910
And people were like,

1250
00:34:25,910 --> 00:34:26,280
you know,

1251
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:28,800
they put a post that little
Gif of him going like,

1252
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:29,631
yeah,

1253
00:34:29,631 --> 00:34:30,710
it was Yoshida.

1254
00:34:31,310 --> 00:34:31,611
Yeah,

1255
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:32,180
that's right.

1256
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:32,631
Yoshida.

1257
00:34:32,631 --> 00:34:33,110
Who was,

1258
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:35,060
he wasn't an Olympic
gold medalist in judo,

1259
00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:36,920
some high level.

1260
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:38,570
So it was a gold medalist.

1261
00:34:39,290 --> 00:34:40,760
He goes for the Zeke,

1262
00:34:40,790 --> 00:34:41,540
you'll choke.

1263
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:42,620
Hoist is fine.

1264
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:43,550
Hoist never,

1265
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:44,450
never taps out.

1266
00:34:44,451 --> 00:34:45,081
And by the way,

1267
00:34:45,081 --> 00:34:47,100
hoist would have just
gone unconscious 100%.

1268
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:47,930
100%.

1269
00:34:47,930 --> 00:34:49,160
And he did go unconscious.

1270
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:54,310
I mean there was a fight where he
fought a Waleed ish looking at his hand.

1271
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:55,401
Yeah,

1272
00:34:55,401 --> 00:34:56,234
but look,

1273
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,313
he's fine.

1274
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,360
They pull him off and he's right.

1275
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:00,200
He's wide awake.

1276
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:00,360
I,

1277
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,250
you can't tell right there.

1278
00:35:01,310 --> 00:35:01,910
Kenya,

1279
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:05,520
the rest of fucked up fucked up pieces.

1280
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:07,730
Well like in the Verdun
and Travis Brown fight,

1281
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:08,660
the Ref fucked up,

1282
00:35:08,661 --> 00:35:09,110
huh?

1283
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:09,410
Oh yeah.

1284
00:35:09,410 --> 00:35:10,243
Pretty bad.

1285
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:11,630
Like you can't have timeouts.

1286
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:12,081
Yeah.

1287
00:35:12,081 --> 00:35:13,180
I wish I got timeouts.

1288
00:35:13,790 --> 00:35:15,860
The referee definitely fucked up there.

1289
00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:16,970
That was well played though.

1290
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:17,350
I mean,

1291
00:35:17,350 --> 00:35:17,730
yeah,

1292
00:35:17,730 --> 00:35:18,740
of course you're going to do that.

1293
00:35:18,830 --> 00:35:18,951
Well,

1294
00:35:18,951 --> 00:35:21,020
I think he was probably
thinking about stopping.

1295
00:35:21,021 --> 00:35:22,970
I mean his finger was snapped in half,

1296
00:35:23,090 --> 00:35:24,260
but we couldn't tell what was going on.

1297
00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:24,950
Hunch though.

1298
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:25,550
Yes.

1299
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:27,440
For like from that Rep's perspective,

1300
00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:28,080
if you're,

1301
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:30,650
cause sometimes your finger does and
you're going to grapple or whatever.

1302
00:35:30,651 --> 00:35:32,330
Your figure comes out of
the glove and you're like,

1303
00:35:32,331 --> 00:35:32,781
Whoa,

1304
00:35:32,781 --> 00:35:34,150
fixed my glove and the glove.

1305
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,410
So like the ref didn't
know until he looked at it.

1306
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:37,560
Do the x,

1307
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,220
the rep actually

1308
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:38,671
stopped it,

1309
00:35:38,671 --> 00:35:39,504
right?

1310
00:35:39,890 --> 00:35:40,410
He did.

1311
00:35:40,410 --> 00:35:42,480
It was good because
everyone was cool with that.

1312
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:42,980
No.

1313
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:44,760
Can you imagine if he
would've stopped the fight?

1314
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:45,743
That would have sucked.

1315
00:35:45,970 --> 00:35:47,820
Who came and wanted to see the fight?

1316
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:48,871
Like I let it go.

1317
00:35:48,871 --> 00:35:49,231
Fuck it.

1318
00:35:49,231 --> 00:35:49,291
No,

1319
00:35:49,291 --> 00:35:49,411
no.

1320
00:35:49,411 --> 00:35:49,861
We're good.

1321
00:35:49,861 --> 00:35:50,694
Everyone's good.

1322
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:53,310
Who cares what the,

1323
00:35:53,310 --> 00:35:54,270
what the rule is?

1324
00:35:54,330 --> 00:35:55,163
We got to have rules.

1325
00:35:56,090 --> 00:35:57,510
If he had a dislocated finger,

1326
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:59,310
I think everybody would
agree really quick.

1327
00:35:59,311 --> 00:36:00,430
If there was a button to vote,

1328
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:01,321
say do we let,

1329
00:36:01,321 --> 00:36:03,300
do we give them a cup of fucking seconds?

1330
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:05,200
His fucking finger is all,

1331
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:07,321
where do you stop it?

1332
00:36:07,321 --> 00:36:07,711
I fuck,

1333
00:36:07,711 --> 00:36:08,820
I'm going to come around my joint.

1334
00:36:08,930 --> 00:36:10,340
You on timeout.

1335
00:36:10,350 --> 00:36:11,040
Let's restart.

1336
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,300
She wished you would have stopped it.

1337
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:13,981
You have to have rules.

1338
00:36:13,981 --> 00:36:15,090
There's no exceptions.

1339
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:17,820
Do you have to have rules for
how you wanted it to stop?

1340
00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:18,780
I don't.

1341
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:20,430
The rest of that fight was complete shit.

1342
00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:20,920
I wouldn't money.

1343
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:21,753
Here's the thing.

1344
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,091
Here's the deal though.

1345
00:36:24,091 --> 00:36:28,050
According to the rules for breezy over
doom was well within his rights to keep

1346
00:36:28,051 --> 00:36:32,370
punching a hundred percent so when he
punched him and referee hadn't stopped and

1347
00:36:32,371 --> 00:36:33,980
he was saying he was calling timeout,

1348
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:35,190
but you can't really do that.

1349
00:36:35,191 --> 00:36:35,930
You can't do that.

1350
00:36:35,930 --> 00:36:36,300
Yeah.

1351
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:38,880
And then the fact that they
just kept going afterwards,

1352
00:36:38,881 --> 00:36:39,331
he decided,

1353
00:36:39,331 --> 00:36:40,950
I'm just going to fight
with a broken finger,

1354
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,030
which is admirable.

1355
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:42,660
Right.

1356
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:43,320
But it's like,

1357
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:43,591
okay,

1358
00:36:43,591 --> 00:36:43,890
but,

1359
00:36:43,890 --> 00:36:47,040
but what would have
happened if you didn't stop?

1360
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:47,641
I mean,

1361
00:36:47,641 --> 00:36:49,440
when he broke your finger with that punch,

1362
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:49,861
he,

1363
00:36:49,861 --> 00:36:50,370
I mean,

1364
00:36:50,370 --> 00:36:53,970
how much different is that than breaking
someone's thigh with a leg kick?

1365
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:55,530
When when they get hurt,

1366
00:36:55,531 --> 00:36:56,250
you don't stop.

1367
00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:57,000
You keep going.

1368
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Then if they stopped with the leg,

1369
00:36:58,001 --> 00:36:59,270
kick me like hold on to Holland.

1370
00:36:59,830 --> 00:37:00,570
Perfect.

1371
00:37:00,570 --> 00:37:01,021
And they're like,

1372
00:37:01,021 --> 00:37:01,854
how bad is it?

1373
00:37:01,890 --> 00:37:02,561
That's not bro.

1374
00:37:02,561 --> 00:37:03,120
Keep going on.

1375
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,110
Someone breaks your forum.

1376
00:37:04,111 --> 00:37:05,700
That happens all the time.

1377
00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:07,020
It happens all the time.

1378
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:09,240
Some blocks the kick and
they get their forum broken.

1379
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:10,560
They stopped the fight.

1380
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:11,281
You know,

1381
00:37:11,281 --> 00:37:15,000
they stopped the fight every time you
went into that fight with broken foot too.

1382
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:16,380
But so when you're,

1383
00:37:16,410 --> 00:37:16,681
you know,

1384
00:37:16,681 --> 00:37:19,050
you catch a punch and it was one
of those weird chocolate dials,

1385
00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:19,621
chocolate,

1386
00:37:19,621 --> 00:37:22,920
Dell style overhand rights to
kind of literally comes down.

1387
00:37:22,921 --> 00:37:24,570
The phytic came down on his finger.

1388
00:37:25,350 --> 00:37:25,511
Yeah.

1389
00:37:25,511 --> 00:37:26,930
Was that is a freak accident?

1390
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:28,510
Is it your legal,

1391
00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:32,620
is it illegal to break a,

1392
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:33,600
your opponent's fingers?

1393
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:33,961
No,

1394
00:37:33,961 --> 00:37:34,471
not like that.

1395
00:37:34,471 --> 00:37:36,030
You're not supposed to
leave or get small joints,

1396
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:38,130
joint manipulation of the fingers,

1397
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:41,460
but since it wasn't on purpose,

1398
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:42,061
you know,

1399
00:37:42,061 --> 00:37:43,080
just like an eye poke.

1400
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,310
It's not legal.

1401
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:45,660
But if it happens,

1402
00:37:45,661 --> 00:37:46,650
you don't stop the fight.

1403
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:46,981
You know,

1404
00:37:46,981 --> 00:37:47,814
you're just like,

1405
00:37:47,970 --> 00:37:48,990
did you see the eyebrows?

1406
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:51,420
It was an accident.

1407
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,550
I post accident finger,

1408
00:37:53,610 --> 00:37:54,540
snap off.

1409
00:37:56,250 --> 00:37:57,083
Look at this,

1410
00:37:57,390 --> 00:37:57,751
look at this.

1411
00:37:57,751 --> 00:37:59,880
He'll look nowhere to go.

1412
00:37:59,881 --> 00:38:01,460
He's got no left leg here to left.

1413
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:03,720
If he could kick them
in the face right now.

1414
00:38:03,721 --> 00:38:04,554
Shit.

1415
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:06,210
That'd be a different story.

1416
00:38:06,330 --> 00:38:07,200
He should be able to,

1417
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:09,810
you should be didn't one FC chain.

1418
00:38:09,811 --> 00:38:11,760
Didn't they go back to
no kicks to the head?

1419
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:12,541
Yeah,

1420
00:38:12,541 --> 00:38:15,270
they had a bad highlights recently.

1421
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:16,110
They,

1422
00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:18,270
some fools getting soccer kicks bed.

1423
00:38:18,410 --> 00:38:18,581
Well,

1424
00:38:18,581 --> 00:38:20,070
did you see the Roger worked at one.

1425
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,133
I remember

1426
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:27,950
seeing one recently fucking
he gusty I love Roger.

1427
00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:28,710
He fought,

1428
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:32,090
he fought one 70 and Roger
for one 55 in the UFC.

1429
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:33,960
He fought a big Brazilian dude.

1430
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:34,771
Wasn't his last fight,

1431
00:38:34,771 --> 00:38:36,160
his last in lots of decision,

1432
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:37,030
but uh,

1433
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:38,320
it was a bad knock out.

1434
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:39,660
A fight synth.

1435
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:40,031
Yeah.

1436
00:38:40,031 --> 00:38:43,930
He's had more than one fight since I
believe random veer in that same lead

1437
00:38:43,931 --> 00:38:45,310
kicked him mother fucker in the face too.

1438
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,090
Damn sure.

1439
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:46,660
Yeah.

1440
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:50,530
Good looking kicked mother to see soccer
kicks are very different when there's a

1441
00:38:50,531 --> 00:38:52,450
cage because you can't get
your head out of the way.

1442
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:53,560
If it's ropes,

1443
00:38:53,770 --> 00:38:56,530
you can get your head under the ropes and
you can kind of move and get away from

1444
00:38:56,531 --> 00:38:56,681
thing.

1445
00:38:56,681 --> 00:38:57,130
Here it is.

1446
00:38:57,130 --> 00:38:58,360
Boom.

1447
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:00,500
I didn't show that.

1448
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:01,410
Show that again Jane.

1449
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:02,493
Oh,

1450
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:03,850
that'll do it.

1451
00:39:03,850 --> 00:39:05,050
But that's a fight though.

1452
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:05,261
Yeah.

1453
00:39:05,261 --> 00:39:06,100
Well he was already,

1454
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,230
he was already hurt and in bad.

1455
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:10,570
Some places call it a bad place to you.

1456
00:39:10,571 --> 00:39:11,050
Brendan,

1457
00:39:11,050 --> 00:39:13,810
would you allow that and
do you have UFC or keep it?

1458
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:18,310
I would not keep it the way it is
unless you hate Bradington sponsors.

1459
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:19,181
I totally allowed.

1460
00:39:19,181 --> 00:39:19,391
Right,

1461
00:39:19,391 --> 00:39:19,930
totally lost.

1462
00:39:19,930 --> 00:39:22,790
The dude's bent over heroin.

1463
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:25,900
A this guy used to drop knees
from north south all the time.

1464
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:26,310
Yeah.

1465
00:39:26,310 --> 00:39:26,580
Oh,

1466
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:27,930
that was the best and it changed.

1467
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:31,540
It changed the way that that occurred.

1468
00:39:31,541 --> 00:39:32,650
It changes it completely.

1469
00:39:32,790 --> 00:39:33,000
Well,

1470
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:33,833
here's the thing.

1471
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:38,290
Well the new rule is a down fighter
is four points on the ground.

1472
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:39,970
Not Three points in there like that.

1473
00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:43,600
So if you have a guy on the
ground and he is covering,

1474
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:44,830
covering up and the turtle,

1475
00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:47,800
all you have to do is
hold onto one of his arms.

1476
00:39:47,950 --> 00:39:52,360
You pick one of his arms off the
ground and at least by my definition,

1477
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:54,610
you could start kicking them
and need them in the face.

1478
00:39:55,450 --> 00:39:56,200
Right.

1479
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:56,800
If you can't,

1480
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,600
if you can't hit a down deponent
because of Tylenol polar.

1481
00:39:59,670 --> 00:39:59,860
Yeah.

1482
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:00,700
You just take one off,

1483
00:40:01,510 --> 00:40:03,550
pick one up and you start blasting him.

1484
00:40:03,610 --> 00:40:07,810
Or if you guys were fucking
knees now 22 feet or like too,

1485
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:08,771
is that for,

1486
00:40:08,771 --> 00:40:09,610
cause it's got two feet.

1487
00:40:09,611 --> 00:40:10,360
Two knees.

1488
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:10,601
Yeah,

1489
00:40:10,601 --> 00:40:11,350
he is it,

1490
00:40:11,350 --> 00:40:12,420
is that a downed opponent?

1491
00:40:12,421 --> 00:40:12,890
Like how,

1492
00:40:12,890 --> 00:40:13,150
what,

1493
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:16,110
what do you can send me a
knee is the death count,

1494
00:40:16,510 --> 00:40:19,480
but two knees if you're
on your knees like,

1495
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:19,900
okay,

1496
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:20,460
so if a,

1497
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:22,000
if a guy's down,

1498
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:22,391
right?

1499
00:40:22,391 --> 00:40:24,970
Once his handcuffs off the ground,

1500
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:26,020
that's when it's legal.

1501
00:40:26,021 --> 00:40:27,100
But his knees are on the ground.

1502
00:40:27,101 --> 00:40:27,790
Still not legal.

1503
00:40:27,790 --> 00:40:28,091
Right.

1504
00:40:28,091 --> 00:40:29,440
Is that how you're still not legal?

1505
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:29,890
Right?

1506
00:40:29,890 --> 00:40:30,340
Yeah,

1507
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:30,880
that's right.

1508
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:31,451
But if a guy,

1509
00:40:31,451 --> 00:40:33,160
so if a guy with the new rules,

1510
00:40:33,161 --> 00:40:36,130
if a guy had his feet flat on the ground
and he was touching the ground with two

1511
00:40:36,131 --> 00:40:38,110
hands and you just
pulled one of those arms,

1512
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:39,700
you can do whatever the fuck you want.

1513
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:39,910
Yep.

1514
00:40:39,910 --> 00:40:40,743
Correct.

1515
00:40:40,890 --> 00:40:41,280
Hmm.

1516
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:41,500
That's,

1517
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:45,220
that'd be some new training or
on your knees down opponent.

1518
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:47,350
I think when both fighters
are on the ground,

1519
00:40:47,351 --> 00:40:50,690
you should be allowed to kick to the
head because I think if a guy can upkick

1520
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:52,290
you for the bottom bullshit,

1521
00:40:52,930 --> 00:40:53,741
you should totally,

1522
00:40:53,741 --> 00:40:55,090
like when someone's going for an arm bar,

1523
00:40:55,091 --> 00:40:55,771
you should be able to,

1524
00:40:55,771 --> 00:40:58,480
I'll kick the fuck out of their face like,

1525
00:40:58,481 --> 00:41:00,280
why are you allowed to defend yourself?

1526
00:41:00,281 --> 00:41:00,530
Right?

1527
00:41:00,530 --> 00:41:02,200
Bottom or me coming at you,

1528
00:41:02,201 --> 00:41:04,300
but I can't strike you at the end.

1529
00:41:04,301 --> 00:41:05,720
It gives you all this other bullshit.

1530
00:41:05,770 --> 00:41:09,430
It gives you an unrealistic sense of
what's real and not real on the ground

1531
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:11,950
because there's a lot of stuff that
goes on the ground and the ground.

1532
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:14,240
That wouldn't happen if the guy
could just kick you in the face,

1533
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:14,650
right?

1534
00:41:14,650 --> 00:41:16,060
Because if you're lying
in a weird position,

1535
00:41:16,061 --> 00:41:18,160
the guy just blasting shins to your face,

1536
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:20,830
you're going to stop what you're doing
and have to readjust and you're going to

1537
00:41:20,831 --> 00:41:21,900
have to make that,

1538
00:41:22,270 --> 00:41:24,310
make that a part of the equation.

1539
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:27,360
You're going to have to prepare
for that totally downward elbows,

1540
00:41:27,370 --> 00:41:27,990
shit on the ground,

1541
00:41:27,990 --> 00:41:28,823
a stupid whore.

1542
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:30,070
It's total bullshit.

1543
00:41:30,090 --> 00:41:32,670
It makes no sense on the ground.

1544
00:41:32,710 --> 00:41:35,690
You may think they brought it up if they
were going to make that rule about the

1545
00:41:35,691 --> 00:41:37,820
ice breaking or whatever the
fuck their reasoning was.

1546
00:41:37,850 --> 00:41:39,740
If I'm standing up and when I do that,

1547
00:41:39,741 --> 00:41:40,221
then okay,

1548
00:41:40,221 --> 00:41:40,610
yeah,

1549
00:41:40,610 --> 00:41:41,331
on your knees,

1550
00:41:41,331 --> 00:41:42,780
you're not going to
have any power to like,

1551
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:46,160
it's not like you're a
dangerous and it's fighting.

1552
00:41:46,161 --> 00:41:47,560
It's no more dangerous than anything else.

1553
00:41:47,850 --> 00:41:48,530
I mean it's a,

1554
00:41:48,530 --> 00:41:49,363
it's a weapon.

1555
00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:51,730
If there was an argument allow,

1556
00:41:52,590 --> 00:41:55,730
but if everyone collectively
says hell fucking no,

1557
00:41:55,910 --> 00:41:56,331
then yes.

1558
00:41:56,331 --> 00:41:57,550
Those are the ones that you,

1559
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:57,741
I mean,

1560
00:41:57,741 --> 00:41:58,281
it's fighting.

1561
00:41:58,281 --> 00:41:58,661
We want to,

1562
00:41:58,661 --> 00:41:58,950
yeah,

1563
00:41:58,950 --> 00:41:59,450
I mean,

1564
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:02,720
don't you think the UFC represents or is,

1565
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:03,380
uh,

1566
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:04,213
represents what,

1567
00:42:04,430 --> 00:42:06,500
what true fighting really is 100%.

1568
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:07,120
It should,

1569
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:07,560
it should.

1570
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:07,881
It's the,

1571
00:42:07,881 --> 00:42:09,710
should the should be that still,

1572
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:09,981
dude,

1573
00:42:09,981 --> 00:42:11,870
I think we should get rid of the cage.

1574
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:15,200
I think they should hold it in a
space the size of a basketball arena.

1575
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:16,000
Goddammit.

1576
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:20,640
And she'd be like a basketball floor and
there should be no fucking cage and I,

1577
00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:22,350
and they just run for what I think.

1578
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:22,791
Okay.

1579
00:42:22,791 --> 00:42:24,470
If I'm the king of the world and uh,

1580
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:26,110
I get to make the news DFC,

1581
00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:27,110
we get rid of the gloves,

1582
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:27,980
no gloves,

1583
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:28,970
no hand tapes.

1584
00:42:29,090 --> 00:42:29,923
That's all bullshit.

1585
00:42:29,930 --> 00:42:31,970
And to my show and an Indian reservation,

1586
00:42:31,971 --> 00:42:32,870
you could do anything you want.

1587
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:33,570
That's what I'm saying.

1588
00:42:33,570 --> 00:42:34,060
What about,

1589
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:36,050
what about gloves?

1590
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:36,681
Well,

1591
00:42:36,681 --> 00:42:37,520
you eye gouge.

1592
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:40,460
Immediate deduction of 1.1 immediate too.

1593
00:42:40,461 --> 00:42:42,920
I gouges you're out Ted
budding wait is over.

1594
00:42:42,950 --> 00:42:47,360
If you did that on the Indian reservation
budding should be in an arm bar.

1595
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:50,160
Can I bite your ankle to get it off by

1596
00:42:52,090 --> 00:42:53,180
writing an eye poking.

1597
00:42:53,181 --> 00:42:56,120
And the only thing is the thing
about buying about ball sheets,

1598
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:59,150
the biting is super dangerous as
far as bacteria and stuff like that.

1599
00:42:59,151 --> 00:43:00,660
I want dude's dying on my show staff

1600
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:04,320
and but,

1601
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:06,050
but blinding and shit.

1602
00:43:06,051 --> 00:43:06,231
Look,

1603
00:43:06,231 --> 00:43:07,720
we know we can poke
each other in the eyes.

1604
00:43:07,721 --> 00:43:08,121
So this is,

1605
00:43:08,121 --> 00:43:08,830
this is not fighting.

1606
00:43:08,830 --> 00:43:10,250
That's just a green can't hit the,

1607
00:43:10,350 --> 00:43:13,350
can't reach into my package
and grabbed my hockey and Dick.

1608
00:43:14,290 --> 00:43:15,760
Dick don't touch the hot grill.

1609
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:17,930
No pet kicks to the back of the head.

1610
00:43:17,931 --> 00:43:19,640
Legal elbows to the back of head,

1611
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:23,500
elbows to the back of the head when
you don't even need rear naked choke.

1612
00:43:23,501 --> 00:43:24,650
So once they allow the elbows,

1613
00:43:25,430 --> 00:43:26,263
legal,

1614
00:43:26,630 --> 00:43:26,961
legal,

1615
00:43:26,961 --> 00:43:29,000
all that past soccer kicks,

1616
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:30,440
stomps,

1617
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:30,861
soccer,

1618
00:43:30,861 --> 00:43:31,640
kicks legal,

1619
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:32,210
we'll do it.

1620
00:43:32,210 --> 00:43:33,890
No cage fighting.

1621
00:43:33,891 --> 00:43:34,760
Chip RF,

1622
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:36,050
start start young league,

1623
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:37,190
that basketball,

1624
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:38,730
this fucking thing.

1625
00:43:38,730 --> 00:43:42,290
And you have a basketball
court for basketball and
basketball is boring as fuck.

1626
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:43,511
How about that Ben?

1627
00:43:43,511 --> 00:43:45,290
So he got that big ass place for football.

1628
00:43:45,370 --> 00:43:46,310
Look at giant space.

1629
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:49,130
How about two dudes meet in the
middle of a fucking football arena?

1630
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:52,460
How about that site and go crazy.

1631
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:55,760
No problem with the basketball arena.

1632
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,240
The problem with the basketball arena is
you're going to have to like change all

1633
00:43:59,241 --> 00:44:01,040
these other rules to force them to fight.

1634
00:44:01,070 --> 00:44:01,611
Exactly.

1635
00:44:01,611 --> 00:44:02,810
Going to have to make yellow cards.

1636
00:44:02,811 --> 00:44:07,190
You have to make all that shit because
you let the public decide even sparring

1637
00:44:07,191 --> 00:44:08,030
and an open room.

1638
00:44:08,031 --> 00:44:08,381
Where does it?

1639
00:44:08,381 --> 00:44:09,214
Big Mat.

1640
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:12,800
One guy doesn't want to fucking spar
and just walking around the room chasing

1641
00:44:13,070 --> 00:44:13,430
good.

1642
00:44:13,430 --> 00:44:17,720
Let the 50,000 people that
would come to my shows is boom.

1643
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,140
Here's another thing I'm doing.

1644
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:22,670
This is another thing I do
and if I'm king of the world,

1645
00:44:22,820 --> 00:44:26,000
I bring Ben her into the UFC immediately.

1646
00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:26,600
I agree.

1647
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:28,240
That's a disgrace.

1648
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:31,110
Everybody in the car golf,

1649
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:32,400
he's sunned him.

1650
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:33,450
Took him down,

1651
00:44:33,450 --> 00:44:34,283
man.

1652
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:35,690
The fuck you wanted let,

1653
00:44:35,730 --> 00:44:36,563
let's just go,

1654
00:44:37,130 --> 00:44:38,490
let's just cover this real quick.

1655
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,550
You'll have cm punk fight,

1656
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:42,670
but not Ben asked.

1657
00:44:42,940 --> 00:44:43,620
Oh yeah,

1658
00:44:43,620 --> 00:44:45,570
the UFC world.

1659
00:44:45,571 --> 00:44:46,404
Are we living?

1660
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:47,760
What are you talking about?

1661
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:48,380
Point.

1662
00:44:48,380 --> 00:44:48,900
Very good point.

1663
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:49,790
That's a headline right there.

1664
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:51,300
1 billion people watch him.

1665
00:44:51,670 --> 00:44:54,990
See what was day 100,000 star.

1666
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:56,450
He made a ton of money,

1667
00:44:56,460 --> 00:45:00,120
made a half a million dollars on paper
that would they what they show and people

1668
00:45:00,121 --> 00:45:01,200
were complaining about it and like,

1669
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:03,360
do you have any eyes that
guy brought to that show?

1670
00:45:03,390 --> 00:45:03,751
Yes,

1671
00:45:03,751 --> 00:45:04,411
he's worth it.

1672
00:45:04,411 --> 00:45:04,620
Money.

1673
00:45:04,620 --> 00:45:05,401
He's a very,

1674
00:45:05,401 --> 00:45:08,820
very famous guy and I think
he handled it really well.

1675
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:13,110
Like as far as like his post
fight speech is interview the way,

1676
00:45:13,111 --> 00:45:13,944
talked about it.

1677
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:14,910
He handled it really.

1678
00:45:14,911 --> 00:45:19,470
He gave Micky Gall we're a weird
speech to him after it was over.

1679
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:21,650
But you've also got a bailout.

1680
00:45:22,610 --> 00:45:25,530
You gotta believe in yourself
the way I believe in myself,

1681
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:26,640
bitch,

1682
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:31,640
I just speak to you just got to really
want to get my advice from you also want

1683
00:45:31,761 --> 00:45:33,450
it to WWE mode right away,

1684
00:45:33,451 --> 00:45:34,284
right?

1685
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:34,730
He's,

1686
00:45:34,730 --> 00:45:35,551
that's his world,

1687
00:45:35,551 --> 00:45:36,180
man.

1688
00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:36,601
This is a,

1689
00:45:36,601 --> 00:45:40,410
this is really his first venture into
reality and you know what I mean?

1690
00:45:40,411 --> 00:45:43,140
You go out there and you
think everything's gonna go
great cause it's gone great

1691
00:45:43,141 --> 00:45:45,840
your whole life with no competition
and then all of a sudden your first

1692
00:45:45,841 --> 00:45:47,430
competition is in the UFC.

1693
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:48,260
Wow.

1694
00:45:48,260 --> 00:45:49,590
Was he going to go any other way?

1695
00:45:49,610 --> 00:45:50,150
It's insane.

1696
00:45:50,150 --> 00:45:51,300
How's it going to be liked it.

1697
00:45:51,450 --> 00:45:51,980
Maybe he was.

1698
00:45:51,980 --> 00:45:52,813
He says he did.

1699
00:45:52,890 --> 00:45:53,600
He says he did.

1700
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:53,970
Eh,

1701
00:45:53,970 --> 00:45:55,470
there's no way they live to fight again.

1702
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:57,270
There's no way hit.

1703
00:45:57,750 --> 00:45:58,261
People were like,

1704
00:45:58,261 --> 00:45:58,891
fuck that.

1705
00:45:58,891 --> 00:46:02,550
I'm not going to go through them with my
family there and he could fight again.

1706
00:46:02,610 --> 00:46:03,730
He could totally find a seat.

1707
00:46:03,890 --> 00:46:04,723
Not In the UFC.

1708
00:46:04,890 --> 00:46:06,360
He's got to fight as an amateur show.

1709
00:46:06,361 --> 00:46:07,410
He just got to learn.

1710
00:46:07,411 --> 00:46:08,340
He ruined that shot.

1711
00:46:08,370 --> 00:46:09,870
You can't find them once you fight pro,

1712
00:46:09,871 --> 00:46:10,800
you can't fight amateur.

1713
00:46:11,010 --> 00:46:11,401
Oh,

1714
00:46:11,401 --> 00:46:12,234
is that how it works?

1715
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:13,373
There's no Glenn,

1716
00:46:13,650 --> 00:46:14,700
you can fight pro,

1717
00:46:14,850 --> 00:46:15,511
but listen,

1718
00:46:15,511 --> 00:46:18,810
you just got to fight people that
are of the same ability as you.

1719
00:46:18,811 --> 00:46:19,740
People that are learning,

1720
00:46:20,030 --> 00:46:20,863
you know what they should do.

1721
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:24,150
You should go on like a regional
circuit and fight fight.

1722
00:46:24,151 --> 00:46:28,020
Guys with similar experience have a whole
documentary like getting back to the

1723
00:46:28,021 --> 00:46:29,350
UFC and fucking sell out.

1724
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:31,830
They dropped the cm punk.

1725
00:46:31,831 --> 00:46:32,664
What's his real name?

1726
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:33,593
Phil Brooks.

1727
00:46:34,470 --> 00:46:35,270
You're Phil Brooks.

1728
00:46:35,270 --> 00:46:36,720
Motherfucker dropped the cm punk.

1729
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:37,780
That's,

1730
00:46:37,780 --> 00:46:41,850
I like keeping it because he had
that name before he came to WWE.

1731
00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:42,721
That was his name.

1732
00:46:42,721 --> 00:46:43,560
That's why he owns it.

1733
00:46:43,561 --> 00:46:46,800
That's why he's allowed to use it still
and everybody knows him as that like

1734
00:46:46,801 --> 00:46:47,640
it's a smart move.

1735
00:46:47,641 --> 00:46:48,690
As far as like marketing,

1736
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:52,470
I think that guy could still go on
the regional shirt circuit and fight.

1737
00:46:52,471 --> 00:46:53,760
People that are just starting out,

1738
00:46:53,761 --> 00:46:58,050
they're just starting out just like
him and he could probably become like a

1739
00:46:58,051 --> 00:46:59,050
competent fighter,

1740
00:46:59,051 --> 00:47:00,240
a competent professional fighter,

1741
00:47:00,241 --> 00:47:02,250
but that's something
that takes a long time.

1742
00:47:02,251 --> 00:47:03,660
It's not like he has any handicaps.

1743
00:47:03,661 --> 00:47:07,890
I love he his will if he has a will and
he has the desire because he enjoys it.

1744
00:47:07,891 --> 00:47:11,610
Apparently if he has a will and he has
a desire and he wants to test himself,

1745
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:16,560
I firmly believe that that guy could
go and become a competent professional

1746
00:47:16,561 --> 00:47:17,100
fighter.

1747
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:17,311
No,

1748
00:47:17,311 --> 00:47:18,060
I didn't say that.

1749
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:20,100
I said a competent professional fighter.

1750
00:47:20,250 --> 00:47:21,660
I think he's a smart guy.

1751
00:47:21,661 --> 00:47:22,860
I think he's a tough guy.

1752
00:47:23,070 --> 00:47:27,270
I just think this was his
first real combat sports
experience and I don't think,

1753
00:47:27,450 --> 00:47:28,283
I think that's it.

1754
00:47:28,650 --> 00:47:30,490
I think they did them a disservice.

1755
00:47:30,491 --> 00:47:31,480
Granted he made whatever,

1756
00:47:31,481 --> 00:47:33,040
some figures after paper you bonus.

1757
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:36,220
I just don't think a day did them a
disservice if he actually wanted to pursue

1758
00:47:36,221 --> 00:47:37,180
this as a career.

1759
00:47:37,540 --> 00:47:38,051
Dana,

1760
00:47:38,051 --> 00:47:40,270
the commission has
coaches Swintt listen man,

1761
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:44,650
you got to take the necessary steps
like ruin else did because there's no

1762
00:47:44,651 --> 00:47:45,221
turning back.

1763
00:47:45,221 --> 00:47:46,510
Once you go to the UFC man,

1764
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:48,280
it's kind of you're in and out brother.

1765
00:47:48,310 --> 00:47:49,900
Well you know guys have come back.

1766
00:47:49,901 --> 00:47:53,610
They've gone to other organizations had
combat 38 with no skills transfer 10

1767
00:47:53,650 --> 00:47:53,921
years.

1768
00:47:53,921 --> 00:47:54,820
It's not likely.

1769
00:47:55,060 --> 00:47:55,691
It's not likely,

1770
00:47:55,691 --> 00:47:59,080
but it's also not likely that you become
a professional fighter at 37 as well.

1771
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:00,940
These none of these things are likely,

1772
00:48:00,941 --> 00:48:02,080
but there's no worries about that though,

1773
00:48:02,081 --> 00:48:02,650
right?

1774
00:48:02,650 --> 00:48:03,483
Well,

1775
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:06,670
most people were doing something else
by the time the 38 and it's not their

1776
00:48:06,671 --> 00:48:07,390
career path.

1777
00:48:07,390 --> 00:48:07,571
You know,

1778
00:48:07,571 --> 00:48:07,701
it's,

1779
00:48:07,701 --> 00:48:10,690
it's a very rare that someone decides
to go into that at such a late stage of

1780
00:48:10,691 --> 00:48:11,524
life.

1781
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:12,041
But look,

1782
00:48:12,041 --> 00:48:14,050
if he's in good shape
and he's a healthy guy,

1783
00:48:14,190 --> 00:48:17,500
what what he needs to do
is if he wants to learn,

1784
00:48:17,710 --> 00:48:18,790
just train all the time,

1785
00:48:18,791 --> 00:48:22,420
train all the time and take your time
in getting involved in competition again

1786
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:23,250
because you,

1787
00:48:23,250 --> 00:48:23,580
you,

1788
00:48:23,580 --> 00:48:23,920
you know,

1789
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:26,710
you can't get an argument with
someone when you only know four words.

1790
00:48:26,790 --> 00:48:26,950
Yeah,

1791
00:48:26,950 --> 00:48:27,571
I liked the guest.

1792
00:48:27,571 --> 00:48:28,241
It's not going to work.

1793
00:48:28,241 --> 00:48:28,750
Right.

1794
00:48:28,750 --> 00:48:29,980
And it's the same thing as a fight.

1795
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:33,910
He's a fighting this kid who I
watched Mickey Golf fight in the UFC,

1796
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:34,430
his first five.

1797
00:48:34,430 --> 00:48:34,631
I'm like,

1798
00:48:34,631 --> 00:48:36,040
this fucking kid is good.

1799
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:37,600
What can we take that guy's back,

1800
00:48:38,150 --> 00:48:38,401
guys.

1801
00:48:38,401 --> 00:48:38,760
Thanks.

1802
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:42,760
[inaudible] like Micky Gall
has some serious work to
do as well in that division

1803
00:48:42,761 --> 00:48:43,990
is a long ways to go.

1804
00:48:44,020 --> 00:48:44,321
But,

1805
00:48:44,321 --> 00:48:46,870
and he dismantled cm punk,

1806
00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:48,640
these other jet brown belt,

1807
00:48:49,450 --> 00:48:49,811
Brown belt.

1808
00:48:49,811 --> 00:48:50,630
But he still has,

1809
00:48:50,630 --> 00:48:53,380
if you look the the spectrum
of that division at me,

1810
00:48:53,590 --> 00:48:56,030
he has a lot of work that of
course it's an insane division,

1811
00:48:56,740 --> 00:48:58,450
but he's still very new.

1812
00:48:58,630 --> 00:49:00,610
Well that was kind of what
cm punk was saying to him.

1813
00:49:00,611 --> 00:49:03,040
Cause he was saying that he didn't belong
in the UFC and the only reason why he

1814
00:49:03,041 --> 00:49:05,440
was in the UFC was to fight a cm punk.

1815
00:49:05,650 --> 00:49:06,730
He was kind of saying that,

1816
00:49:06,731 --> 00:49:08,530
but what the kid's doing is being smart.

1817
00:49:08,531 --> 00:49:09,670
He's just self deprecating.

1818
00:49:09,910 --> 00:49:11,110
He's a smart fucking kid.

1819
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:11,681
I like,

1820
00:49:11,681 --> 00:49:12,431
I would call about sage.

1821
00:49:12,431 --> 00:49:13,870
Northcutt said he was corny.

1822
00:49:14,610 --> 00:49:15,101
It was really good.

1823
00:49:15,101 --> 00:49:15,934
Really good job.

1824
00:49:16,010 --> 00:49:17,660
[inaudible]

1825
00:49:18,260 --> 00:49:19,090
speech.

1826
00:49:19,090 --> 00:49:19,960
Oh all fuck.

1827
00:49:19,961 --> 00:49:20,590
Yeah.

1828
00:49:20,590 --> 00:49:21,230
And you know what's,

1829
00:49:21,230 --> 00:49:23,770
what's fucking the sage
have a fight coming up.

1830
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:24,311
I Dunno dude.

1831
00:49:24,311 --> 00:49:25,360
That's the heartthrob fight.

1832
00:49:25,390 --> 00:49:26,050
Those two,

1833
00:49:26,050 --> 00:49:26,330
couple,

1834
00:49:26,330 --> 00:49:26,501
one,

1835
00:49:26,501 --> 00:49:28,990
two acuities couple
dime pieces going at it.

1836
00:49:29,770 --> 00:49:31,180
I don't know what Micky Gall drives.

1837
00:49:31,181 --> 00:49:32,410
So hopefully something cool.

1838
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:33,210
Yeah.

1839
00:49:33,210 --> 00:49:36,820
Strictly used to drive American
and then Shit on Cobra.

1840
00:49:36,850 --> 00:49:38,140
Driving to a Japanese car.

1841
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:39,460
Pick him up.

1842
00:49:39,460 --> 00:49:40,390
America gets after him.

1843
00:49:40,391 --> 00:49:40,700
Yay.

1844
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:43,510
I didn't even know that
fell or it's got a jackpot.

1845
00:49:43,540 --> 00:49:45,460
An HR hooked him up.

1846
00:49:45,461 --> 00:49:45,780
Trump.

1847
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:46,001
Yeah.

1848
00:49:46,001 --> 00:49:48,130
Someone's got to get them up
and not even like a corvette,

1849
00:49:48,131 --> 00:49:48,964
like a customer.

1850
00:49:48,970 --> 00:49:50,410
Shelby Bro Mustang.

1851
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:51,130
Mustang.

1852
00:49:51,130 --> 00:49:51,821
The new one.

1853
00:49:51,821 --> 00:49:52,130
New One.

1854
00:49:52,130 --> 00:49:53,200
Just shits on them.

1855
00:49:53,350 --> 00:49:54,940
Honk and narrow back in the action.

1856
00:49:54,941 --> 00:49:55,631
Kenny Robertson.

1857
00:49:55,631 --> 00:49:56,464
This is a good fight.

1858
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:57,680
Any Robertson slick,

1859
00:49:57,760 --> 00:49:58,530
however,

1860
00:49:58,530 --> 00:50:00,910
Kenny Robinson is one that
hit that weird leg lock.

1861
00:50:00,911 --> 00:50:03,520
Remember that weird leg
lock he got from a scramble?

1862
00:50:03,521 --> 00:50:05,080
It was a real strange knee bar.

1863
00:50:05,081 --> 00:50:05,411
I was like,

1864
00:50:05,411 --> 00:50:05,591
dude,

1865
00:50:05,591 --> 00:50:07,060
I don't think I've seen
one of those before.

1866
00:50:07,690 --> 00:50:08,620
I don't remember why,

1867
00:50:08,740 --> 00:50:09,311
but I'm trying to,

1868
00:50:09,311 --> 00:50:09,521
yeah,

1869
00:50:09,521 --> 00:50:10,870
I'm trying to remember how he hit it.

1870
00:50:10,930 --> 00:50:12,180
He hit about a,

1871
00:50:12,910 --> 00:50:14,170
he thought Ben Saunders.

1872
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:16,540
Who the fuck is that?

1873
00:50:16,750 --> 00:50:16,961
Yeah,

1874
00:50:16,961 --> 00:50:18,310
that's just Kenny Robinson talking.

1875
00:50:18,311 --> 00:50:22,120
Why did they have a solid
rustler good Jujitsu?

1876
00:50:23,510 --> 00:50:23,970
He's,

1877
00:50:23,970 --> 00:50:24,791
he's no joke,

1878
00:50:24,791 --> 00:50:25,031
man.

1879
00:50:25,031 --> 00:50:26,740
Kenny Kenny Roberts is very smart.

1880
00:50:26,741 --> 00:50:28,010
I'll fight him and Ben Saunders.

1881
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:28,720
That was tough.

1882
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:29,020
Yeah.

1883
00:50:29,020 --> 00:50:32,060
Three hard rounds do hop out.

1884
00:50:32,061 --> 00:50:32,480
Uh,

1885
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:33,141
how about your boy?

1886
00:50:33,141 --> 00:50:33,441
Chill.

1887
00:50:33,441 --> 00:50:34,760
Sewn in Sanibel tour.

1888
00:50:34,850 --> 00:50:35,683
Good move.

1889
00:50:35,690 --> 00:50:36,171
Good move.

1890
00:50:36,171 --> 00:50:37,310
Right move for him.

1891
00:50:37,430 --> 00:50:37,881
Listen man,

1892
00:50:37,881 --> 00:50:39,290
I hope Shane Carwyn does it too.

1893
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:40,281
Not necessarily that.

1894
00:50:40,281 --> 00:50:41,600
I hope Shane doesn't sign with the UFC.

1895
00:50:41,601 --> 00:50:43,400
I hope you signs where
he gets the best deal.

1896
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:47,240
100% but I think it's good
to have guys like Rory.

1897
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:50,540
It's good to have like legit
worldclass fighters over there.

1898
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:51,260
I like it.

1899
00:50:51,260 --> 00:50:52,940
I think competition is
good for everything.

1900
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:54,200
It's good for everybody.

1901
00:50:54,201 --> 00:50:56,180
It elevates everybody everywhere.

1902
00:50:56,510 --> 00:50:57,130
Like with,

1903
00:50:57,130 --> 00:50:57,780
with jail.

1904
00:50:57,780 --> 00:51:01,220
It was a little like last night I
was watching a Bella torn that child.

1905
00:51:01,221 --> 00:51:03,230
Do you know he does his
whole gangster shit talking.

1906
00:51:03,700 --> 00:51:05,840
Remember he hasn't been around in a while.

1907
00:51:05,841 --> 00:51:10,100
So when you used to like a fricking Conor
McGregor shit talking [inaudible] it

1908
00:51:10,101 --> 00:51:11,510
was like hot tub time machine.

1909
00:51:11,630 --> 00:51:12,350
Like we like it.

1910
00:51:12,350 --> 00:51:15,210
It was a little old
school and I talked to,

1911
00:51:15,490 --> 00:51:16,820
I love chili like a bro.

1912
00:51:17,030 --> 00:51:18,380
I fucking love jail,

1913
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:21,560
but I was like [inaudible] this is Tom.

1914
00:51:21,590 --> 00:51:22,520
This is old school.

1915
00:51:22,550 --> 00:51:24,560
It's certainly seemed prepared.

1916
00:51:25,290 --> 00:51:26,123
Yes,

1917
00:51:26,950 --> 00:51:27,380
I did it.

1918
00:51:27,380 --> 00:51:28,213
It was always like,

1919
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:29,093
it was more,

1920
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:30,220
it was natural,

1921
00:51:30,230 --> 00:51:31,370
but also there's no,

1922
00:51:31,460 --> 00:51:33,230
like he's calling out teat or tease,

1923
00:51:33,231 --> 00:51:33,501
you know,

1924
00:51:33,501 --> 00:51:35,100
and there's like no real animosity.

1925
00:51:35,260 --> 00:51:36,680
And then Tito tweet back like,

1926
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:37,580
I'm going to,

1927
00:51:37,580 --> 00:51:39,330
I'm going to show you the bad guy's girl.

1928
00:51:41,010 --> 00:51:41,990
God dammit.

1929
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:44,360
We got to 40 year olds
talking shit on Twitter,

1930
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:46,993
silence.

1931
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:49,200
And I looked and I fucking love Jen and I,

1932
00:51:49,220 --> 00:51:49,401
I,

1933
00:51:49,401 --> 00:51:52,700
I love to see him fight but seeing
his shit talking compared to Connor's,

1934
00:51:52,701 --> 00:51:53,240
it's like,

1935
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:55,550
well Connor took that
torch and ran with it.

1936
00:51:55,580 --> 00:51:55,761
Yeah.

1937
00:51:55,761 --> 00:51:56,571
I had dinner the other night.

1938
00:51:56,571 --> 00:51:57,920
Would Maynard from tool?

1939
00:51:57,950 --> 00:52:00,120
Mainer Keenan is a buddy of mine and uh,

1940
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:00,650
he's uh,

1941
00:52:00,650 --> 00:52:01,483
he's in Jujitsu,

1942
00:52:01,490 --> 00:52:02,270
he's a purple belt,

1943
00:52:02,270 --> 00:52:02,960
loves Jujitsu,

1944
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:03,610
loves MMA.

1945
00:52:03,610 --> 00:52:05,090
And we were talking about
the UFC and he goes,

1946
00:52:05,091 --> 00:52:05,690
God damn it,

1947
00:52:05,690 --> 00:52:07,610
why the fuck is it becoming a WWE?

1948
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:08,331
He goes,

1949
00:52:08,331 --> 00:52:09,350
this is making me sad.

1950
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:12,020
Cause it's like everybody's trying to
be Connor Mcgregor and they're coming up

1951
00:52:12,021 --> 00:52:14,680
with these corny fucking pre-fight promos.

1952
00:52:14,681 --> 00:52:15,060
It's tough.

1953
00:52:15,060 --> 00:52:15,410
He's like,

1954
00:52:15,410 --> 00:52:16,101
aw,

1955
00:52:16,101 --> 00:52:18,680
it makes me just cause he's,

1956
00:52:19,070 --> 00:52:19,371
you know,

1957
00:52:19,371 --> 00:52:22,730
he's just a fucking super
smart genius dude here.

1958
00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:23,810
Stuff doesn't he loves,

1959
00:52:24,020 --> 00:52:25,010
he loves martial arts.

1960
00:52:25,011 --> 00:52:28,640
So when he sees non martial
artists type behavior,

1961
00:52:28,641 --> 00:52:30,990
like pro wrestling type behavior and my,

1962
00:52:31,070 --> 00:52:32,300
if they just trying to sell themselves,

1963
00:52:32,301 --> 00:52:33,710
he should tell Shawn was talking about,

1964
00:52:33,711 --> 00:52:33,921
he goes,

1965
00:52:33,921 --> 00:52:35,840
I just beat the fucking
number two container.

1966
00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:36,800
I'm ranked number one.

1967
00:52:37,130 --> 00:52:38,810
Give me the fucking rematch.

1968
00:52:38,811 --> 00:52:39,740
What do I gotta do?

1969
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:40,071
He goes,

1970
00:52:40,071 --> 00:52:41,020
I'm not a shit talker.

1971
00:52:41,021 --> 00:52:41,930
I'm not going to do that.

1972
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:43,130
I'll tell you I'm not finding one.

1973
00:52:43,130 --> 00:52:43,700
But then I went,

1974
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:44,600
I don't know if it's enough.

1975
00:52:44,930 --> 00:52:47,990
Is there any way can watch like ric flair
or some shit and just pick up a couple

1976
00:52:47,991 --> 00:52:48,101
of,

1977
00:52:48,101 --> 00:52:48,490
come on.

1978
00:52:48,490 --> 00:52:52,310
You just pick up a few things like watch
macho man and just start spitting some

1979
00:52:52,311 --> 00:52:53,144
game online.

1980
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:54,590
It's sports entertainment,

1981
00:52:54,650 --> 00:52:56,300
but the thing is you can't,

1982
00:52:56,301 --> 00:52:58,220
like Connor is that guy.

1983
00:52:58,250 --> 00:52:58,940
That's him.

1984
00:52:58,940 --> 00:53:00,470
That's how he talks all the time.

1985
00:53:00,471 --> 00:53:05,360
He's a sharp shit talker from Ireland and
he knows how to fight and he knows how

1986
00:53:05,361 --> 00:53:05,931
to talk.

1987
00:53:05,931 --> 00:53:07,610
And it's an unusual combination.

1988
00:53:07,611 --> 00:53:08,180
Yes.

1989
00:53:08,180 --> 00:53:11,240
Most guys don't know how to
talk that know how to fight.

1990
00:53:11,241 --> 00:53:13,460
And most guys who know how to
talk don't know how to fight.

1991
00:53:13,670 --> 00:53:14,480
Correct.

1992
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:14,721
When do,

1993
00:53:14,721 --> 00:53:16,850
you could talk that much
shit and fight that.

1994
00:53:16,851 --> 00:53:17,300
Well,

1995
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:18,230
you're a unicorn.

1996
00:53:18,231 --> 00:53:18,381
Well,

1997
00:53:18,381 --> 00:53:19,520
he's a unicorn also.

1998
00:53:19,521 --> 00:53:19,790
He,

1999
00:53:19,790 --> 00:53:20,990
he can fight the mind,

2000
00:53:20,991 --> 00:53:24,530
fucking see puts on dudes
because he can talk so much shit.

2001
00:53:24,930 --> 00:53:26,640
The love of all those
people that are behind them,

2002
00:53:26,641 --> 00:53:31,110
all those Irish people and then the mind
fucking from them screaming at you all

2003
00:53:31,111 --> 00:53:31,501
the time,

2004
00:53:31,501 --> 00:53:32,070
the entire,

2005
00:53:32,070 --> 00:53:32,431
you know,

2006
00:53:32,431 --> 00:53:36,090
six weeks up until the fight and then
the shit that he says about you and the

2007
00:53:36,091 --> 00:53:37,890
fact that he might very well sleep.

2008
00:53:37,891 --> 00:53:42,640
You could mine my very well dropped out
nuclear left hand on your face route.

2009
00:53:42,690 --> 00:53:44,310
Rumor is Eddie Alvarez in him.

2010
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:45,530
Tangoing uh,

2011
00:53:45,570 --> 00:53:47,540
and maybe a little
something that I was shy.

2012
00:53:49,090 --> 00:53:49,890
Hey,

2013
00:53:49,890 --> 00:53:50,830
just give me an eyebrow

2014
00:53:52,570 --> 00:53:54,270
outside Madison Square Garden.

2015
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:56,010
If it was a mute,

2016
00:53:56,011 --> 00:53:57,090
if it was a rumor.

2017
00:53:57,120 --> 00:53:57,601
There's the,

2018
00:53:57,601 --> 00:53:58,710
there's the Kenny Robertson,

2019
00:53:58,770 --> 00:54:00,120
a arm bar or leg lock.

2020
00:54:00,121 --> 00:54:01,080
He took it from the back.

2021
00:54:01,110 --> 00:54:01,820
That's what it was.

2022
00:54:01,820 --> 00:54:02,653
Oh yeah.

2023
00:54:02,730 --> 00:54:03,091
Crazy,

2024
00:54:03,091 --> 00:54:03,540
right?

2025
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:03,751
Yeah,

2026
00:54:03,751 --> 00:54:04,470
I remember that.

2027
00:54:04,470 --> 00:54:04,990
Yeah.

2028
00:54:04,990 --> 00:54:06,480
Motherfuckers stretched out.

2029
00:54:06,810 --> 00:54:08,310
See that shit wouldn't work with me.

2030
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:10,430
[inaudible] got rolling.

2031
00:54:10,660 --> 00:54:13,600
Carnero who's just a black
belt really on the ground.

2032
00:54:13,690 --> 00:54:14,610
It's like forever.

2033
00:54:14,810 --> 00:54:15,360
Yeah.

2034
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:16,410
Carneros nasty.

2035
00:54:17,850 --> 00:54:18,870
Going to have a hard time.

2036
00:54:18,871 --> 00:54:19,291
Her did,

2037
00:54:19,291 --> 00:54:19,920
sir.

2038
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:20,400
His,

2039
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:20,701
his,

2040
00:54:20,701 --> 00:54:21,040
uh,

2041
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:22,380
Jujitsu is very nasty.

2042
00:54:22,410 --> 00:54:23,280
Very nasty.

2043
00:54:23,950 --> 00:54:24,180
Yeah.

2044
00:54:24,180 --> 00:54:24,330
It's,

2045
00:54:24,330 --> 00:54:25,290
it's an interesting fight,

2046
00:54:25,291 --> 00:54:26,124
man.

2047
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:27,970
That's all with the headhunter Connor.

2048
00:54:28,130 --> 00:54:28,710
Yeah.

2049
00:54:28,710 --> 00:54:29,543
If it happens,

2050
00:54:29,910 --> 00:54:31,650
if allegedly acid square garden,

2051
00:54:31,651 --> 00:54:33,330
if it happens in a couple of months,

2052
00:54:33,900 --> 00:54:34,770
maybe that's gonna happen.

2053
00:54:35,030 --> 00:54:35,491
It's gonna happen.

2054
00:54:35,491 --> 00:54:36,510
But if it does happen,

2055
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:37,593
uh,

2056
00:54:38,100 --> 00:54:38,731
that might happen.

2057
00:54:38,731 --> 00:54:41,960
Joe and he can grapple
for freaking graphical,

2058
00:54:42,020 --> 00:54:42,853
forgetting I'm a can.

2059
00:54:42,980 --> 00:54:47,020
Russell's a fucking grinder
and whatever endurance issues,

2060
00:54:47,060 --> 00:54:47,540
Connor,

2061
00:54:47,540 --> 00:54:51,090
it may have he better eye on those fuckers
out before you go to town with that

2062
00:54:51,091 --> 00:54:51,330
guy.

2063
00:54:51,330 --> 00:54:51,661
You know,

2064
00:54:51,661 --> 00:54:53,700
I'm the biggest Conor
McGregor fan on the planet.

2065
00:54:53,730 --> 00:54:54,570
I love that guy.

2066
00:54:54,571 --> 00:54:58,950
But looking at his potential
opponents at one 55 and it's 70,

2067
00:54:58,951 --> 00:54:59,220
it's like,

2068
00:54:59,220 --> 00:55:00,240
fuck man,

2069
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:00,660
it,

2070
00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:01,620
it doesn't look pretty.

2071
00:55:01,820 --> 00:55:03,930
And Eddies of rough matchup for him,

2072
00:55:03,990 --> 00:55:05,170
it's probably easiest,

2073
00:55:05,190 --> 00:55:07,230
but I don't think it's an easy one at all.

2074
00:55:08,150 --> 00:55:08,590
I'm saying,

2075
00:55:08,590 --> 00:55:09,423
I'm saying,

2076
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:10,830
I'm saying that 55,

2077
00:55:10,890 --> 00:55:12,210
they're all fucking tough.

2078
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:13,860
They are all top stylistically.

2079
00:55:13,950 --> 00:55:15,000
If you know you're like,

2080
00:55:15,001 --> 00:55:15,571
God damn,

2081
00:55:15,571 --> 00:55:17,120
I Guess Eddie's the best matchup.

2082
00:55:17,210 --> 00:55:19,650
I don't see it a lot because
he's on a fucking nightmare,

2083
00:55:19,710 --> 00:55:21,780
I don't think is the best match up at all.

2084
00:55:21,810 --> 00:55:22,471
Who would you say is,

2085
00:55:22,471 --> 00:55:22,590
well,

2086
00:55:22,590 --> 00:55:23,130
first of all,

2087
00:55:23,130 --> 00:55:24,810
any Eddie's known for having a chat.

2088
00:55:25,140 --> 00:55:27,870
It's known for having a Chin and known
for being able to bounce back from

2089
00:55:27,871 --> 00:55:28,470
getting hurt.

2090
00:55:28,470 --> 00:55:32,250
He's got massive heart
and he fights at his best.

2091
00:55:32,251 --> 00:55:33,360
When the chips were on the line,

2092
00:55:33,510 --> 00:55:34,710
like in the dos Anjos fight,

2093
00:55:34,740 --> 00:55:35,940
nobody gave him a shot and that fight,

2094
00:55:35,941 --> 00:55:36,840
who gave him the shot in that fight?

2095
00:55:36,841 --> 00:55:37,321
He was probably like,

2096
00:55:37,321 --> 00:55:37,650
uh,

2097
00:55:37,650 --> 00:55:38,970
at least two to one underdog.

2098
00:55:38,971 --> 00:55:39,340
Right?

2099
00:55:39,340 --> 00:55:39,680
For sure.

2100
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:42,900
Going into that fight with a dominant
champion at Hoffeld Dosantos so just got

2101
00:55:42,901 --> 00:55:46,410
done stop and cowboys Serone in
the first round working Nate Diaz,

2102
00:55:46,620 --> 00:55:47,010
you know,

2103
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:49,170
beating the shit out at
pedes for five rounds.

2104
00:55:49,230 --> 00:55:50,030
You're looking at dos sign,

2105
00:55:50,030 --> 00:55:50,341
just going,

2106
00:55:50,341 --> 00:55:51,090
Holy Shit,

2107
00:55:51,090 --> 00:55:53,490
this guy might be able to run
this division for a long time.

2108
00:55:53,700 --> 00:55:57,540
And Alvarez clips him and he looked
real good before he clipped him.

2109
00:55:57,541 --> 00:56:00,090
He had some sleepless nights before.

2110
00:56:00,091 --> 00:56:03,920
Then we had real Eddie
Alvarez for until that fight.

2111
00:56:03,921 --> 00:56:04,170
You're like,

2112
00:56:04,170 --> 00:56:05,390
that's the fucking belt door.

2113
00:56:05,580 --> 00:56:07,310
That's the fucking free
agent that we want.

2114
00:56:07,311 --> 00:56:11,010
And See Melendez fight and the
Pettis fight you like Jesus.

2115
00:56:11,011 --> 00:56:11,850
Scott's better.

2116
00:56:11,940 --> 00:56:13,800
You know it's part of it
is he's gotten better.

2117
00:56:13,830 --> 00:56:15,420
Well the UFC jitters or are real.

2118
00:56:15,421 --> 00:56:17,520
So no matter if you have
30 fights are apparently,

2119
00:56:17,521 --> 00:56:18,630
if you have zero cm punk,

2120
00:56:18,631 --> 00:56:19,620
those jitters are real.

2121
00:56:19,980 --> 00:56:21,120
Where is he training now?

2122
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:21,481
Who?

2123
00:56:21,481 --> 00:56:22,101
Eddie Alvarez.

2124
00:56:22,101 --> 00:56:22,621
He with your board?

2125
00:56:22,621 --> 00:56:23,830
Mark Henry with Mark Henry.

2126
00:56:23,860 --> 00:56:26,650
That's a big Frankie Edgar
and he's wrestling at Rutgers.

2127
00:56:26,651 --> 00:56:28,570
He's a monster man telling you.

2128
00:56:28,571 --> 00:56:30,170
Mark Henry is a mother there.

2129
00:56:30,180 --> 00:56:31,870
Barboza they've all those guys.

2130
00:56:31,870 --> 00:56:34,000
But you look at the top
five and for Connor.

2131
00:56:34,001 --> 00:56:35,050
It's fucking tough man.

2132
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:35,891
It is tough.

2133
00:56:35,891 --> 00:56:40,090
But I think that's part of the
reason why Eddie looks so good now.

2134
00:56:40,210 --> 00:56:41,800
He looks so fucking sharp.

2135
00:56:41,801 --> 00:56:44,440
You can't discount the fact
he's trained with Barboza.

2136
00:56:44,441 --> 00:56:45,190
He's tranquil.

2137
00:56:45,190 --> 00:56:49,660
Frankie Edgar and he's absorbing from
Henry is the mastermind of Mark Henry.

2138
00:56:49,661 --> 00:56:50,760
He's a bad motherfucker,

2139
00:56:50,770 --> 00:56:50,951
dude.

2140
00:56:50,951 --> 00:56:53,970
He's the the most slept
on trainer marketing.

2141
00:56:53,980 --> 00:56:57,070
I know most slept on street doesn't
want to be in the limelight and he hates

2142
00:56:57,071 --> 00:56:57,581
that stuff.

2143
00:56:57,581 --> 00:56:59,590
But if he was more outspoken,

2144
00:56:59,710 --> 00:57:00,940
I mean Jesus Christ.

2145
00:57:01,100 --> 00:57:01,250
Yeah,

2146
00:57:01,250 --> 00:57:01,901
it'd be all over.

2147
00:57:01,901 --> 00:57:06,670
Rashad pulled me aside at one of the
umcs and was just going on and on about

2148
00:57:06,671 --> 00:57:07,720
what a bad mother fucker.

2149
00:57:07,721 --> 00:57:08,670
Never seen anything like him.

2150
00:57:08,671 --> 00:57:10,420
And he still checks in on me all the time.

2151
00:57:10,780 --> 00:57:11,740
I don't fight anymore.

2152
00:57:12,550 --> 00:57:15,280
I worked with him for May two or
three weeks and he would have,

2153
00:57:15,281 --> 00:57:15,941
I'm telling you man,

2154
00:57:15,941 --> 00:57:17,830
like a path like this in his basement.

2155
00:57:17,830 --> 00:57:21,520
I had sores on my feet
because I was barefoot and in
his basement doing footwork

2156
00:57:21,610 --> 00:57:22,190
nonstop.

2157
00:57:22,190 --> 00:57:25,090
He had notes for fucking days like,

2158
00:57:25,091 --> 00:57:25,270
uh,

2159
00:57:25,270 --> 00:57:26,650
like he's obsessed with it.

2160
00:57:26,830 --> 00:57:27,131
Yeah.

2161
00:57:27,131 --> 00:57:27,381
He's,

2162
00:57:27,381 --> 00:57:28,370
he's brilliant.

2163
00:57:28,540 --> 00:57:32,170
Clearly on the spectrum makes the best
pizza in fucking New Jersey in the world

2164
00:57:32,171 --> 00:57:32,410
too.

2165
00:57:32,410 --> 00:57:33,101
I heard heard,

2166
00:57:33,101 --> 00:57:34,200
is this a silly cook?

2167
00:57:34,780 --> 00:57:35,613
What?

2168
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:37,300
God,

2169
00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:38,980
I'm a fungus pizzas off and that,

2170
00:57:39,310 --> 00:57:41,680
that's a place where
pizzas like highly praise.

2171
00:57:41,681 --> 00:57:44,240
Like you gotta you gotta come with some
real pizza if you want to make a living

2172
00:57:44,730 --> 00:57:45,341
in New Jersey.

2173
00:57:45,341 --> 00:57:46,174
Yeah.

2174
00:57:46,420 --> 00:57:48,950
Catching up world champions
and making mean espe pizzas.

2175
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:49,833
I don't think Eddie's,

2176
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:50,260
uh,

2177
00:57:50,260 --> 00:57:51,640
I don't think that's an easy fight.

2178
00:57:51,641 --> 00:57:54,340
I don't think [inaudible] at
one 50 that's what I'm saying.

2179
00:57:54,520 --> 00:57:56,440
I'm saying if you looked
at those top five,

2180
00:57:56,590 --> 00:57:58,480
none of them are easy at all.

2181
00:57:58,570 --> 00:57:58,910
Like it.

2182
00:57:58,910 --> 00:58:02,170
The future doesn't look great
at 55 I don't want to see,

2183
00:58:02,171 --> 00:58:02,371
I don't,

2184
00:58:02,371 --> 00:58:05,500
I can't say that either because
you don't get that til five.

2185
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:05,800
Tell me,

2186
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:06,890
tell me the best match.

2187
00:58:07,030 --> 00:58:07,270
We'll,

2188
00:58:07,270 --> 00:58:09,160
Nate is clearly one of the best.

2189
00:58:09,340 --> 00:58:11,350
Nate's clearly one of the best 155 pounds.

2190
00:58:11,610 --> 00:58:12,110
Diaz.

2191
00:58:12,110 --> 00:58:12,490
Yes,

2192
00:58:12,490 --> 00:58:12,760
he's,

2193
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:14,410
he's better at 55 and [inaudible] 70.

2194
00:58:14,740 --> 00:58:15,011
Yeah.

2195
00:58:15,011 --> 00:58:18,490
Well seventies not really fighting
at 70 mean he fought Rory at 70.

2196
00:58:18,491 --> 00:58:19,120
He fought.

2197
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:21,820
So I'm saying fuck Conor at
70 and that was a tough out.

2198
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:24,940
They did that because that's what they
did the first time when he took the fight

2199
00:58:24,941 --> 00:58:25,601
last minute notice,

2200
00:58:25,601 --> 00:58:27,390
he wanted to have the
exact same corrections.

2201
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:29,170
That's why Conor did it at 70 again,

2202
00:58:29,470 --> 00:58:33,040
but Nate's of one 50 fiver and at one
55 like when he fought Michael Johnson,

2203
00:58:33,041 --> 00:58:33,880
when he's shredded,

2204
00:58:34,060 --> 00:58:35,050
he looked at its best.

2205
00:58:35,051 --> 00:58:35,380
Right.

2206
00:58:35,380 --> 00:58:36,011
He's up better.

2207
00:58:36,011 --> 00:58:36,611
Nate Dhea.

2208
00:58:36,611 --> 00:58:38,650
And if you see the Nate Diaz that beat,

2209
00:58:38,740 --> 00:58:43,030
you know Michael Johnson if 55 he's one
of the best fighters in that division

2210
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:43,780
for sure.

2211
00:58:43,780 --> 00:58:44,351
Hands Down,

2212
00:58:44,351 --> 00:58:44,950
not even close.

2213
00:58:44,950 --> 00:58:46,510
So Connor just beat him.

2214
00:58:46,540 --> 00:58:48,310
I mean obviously a very close fight,

2215
00:58:48,311 --> 00:58:49,390
very close decision.

2216
00:58:49,810 --> 00:58:51,340
But I think,

2217
00:58:51,370 --> 00:58:52,930
I think it was probably a fair decision.

2218
00:58:52,931 --> 00:58:54,070
I have to go over it and score it.

2219
00:58:54,071 --> 00:58:55,640
I haven't gone over it and scored it.

2220
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:55,940
It was,

2221
00:58:55,940 --> 00:58:56,191
it was,

2222
00:58:56,191 --> 00:58:57,370
it was a fair decision.

2223
00:58:57,371 --> 00:58:58,204
I mean it was,

2224
00:58:58,340 --> 00:59:00,140
I don't think anyone lost in that fight.

2225
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:01,000
But yeah,

2226
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,110
going to the judges.

2227
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:05,230
I did have Connor slightly
edging that fight.

2228
00:59:05,260 --> 00:59:05,901
I think you,

2229
00:59:05,901 --> 00:59:07,150
you look at the damage done,

2230
00:59:07,151 --> 00:59:08,050
he did more damage,

2231
00:59:08,051 --> 00:59:08,350
you know,

2232
00:59:08,350 --> 00:59:09,370
he dropped Nate.

2233
00:59:09,460 --> 00:59:10,570
You know what makes sense about that?

2234
00:59:10,571 --> 00:59:15,571
I saw at the grocery store randomly and
he was saying that he was falling on

2235
00:59:16,151 --> 00:59:17,890
purpose to dupe Connor and he goes,

2236
00:59:17,891 --> 00:59:19,170
I knew the first two rounds,

2237
00:59:19,210 --> 00:59:20,050
three rounds are going to be,

2238
00:59:20,470 --> 00:59:21,590
he's so fast as me,

2239
00:59:21,591 --> 00:59:22,190
tough.

2240
00:59:22,190 --> 00:59:22,851
So when he hit me,

2241
00:59:22,851 --> 00:59:25,580
the plan was to fall down
to get him to false down,

2242
00:59:25,610 --> 00:59:26,630
to follow me down.

2243
00:59:26,780 --> 00:59:27,021
He goes,

2244
00:59:27,021 --> 00:59:28,130
cause I couldn't take him down.

2245
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:30,500
So the plan was given
to follow me down there.

2246
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:31,070
Ooh,

2247
00:59:31,070 --> 00:59:31,850
that's interesting.

2248
00:59:31,850 --> 00:59:33,290
That's a risky game plan.

2249
00:59:33,350 --> 00:59:34,100
That's what that,

2250
00:59:34,100 --> 00:59:35,450
that's from the horse's mouth,

2251
00:59:35,860 --> 00:59:36,350
that,

2252
00:59:36,350 --> 00:59:37,160
that's one of those,

2253
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:38,850
is that one of those I
meant to do that things.

2254
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:40,153
I don't know.

2255
00:59:40,700 --> 00:59:41,533
I don't know.

2256
00:59:41,790 --> 00:59:42,570
I don't know Nate.

2257
00:59:42,570 --> 00:59:46,400
He has enough to be like you serious
as the pee wee Herman defense.

2258
00:59:47,060 --> 00:59:47,720
Either way.

2259
00:59:47,720 --> 00:59:48,650
I meant to do that,

2260
00:59:48,690 --> 00:59:49,340
huh?

2261
00:59:49,340 --> 00:59:49,850
Yeah.

2262
00:59:49,850 --> 00:59:50,200
Yeah,

2263
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:50,781
me either way.

2264
00:59:50,781 --> 00:59:54,270
Nate's one of the best in the world and
there's a more of a nightmare at 55 is

2265
00:59:54,310 --> 00:59:55,143
I'm trying to get to,

2266
00:59:55,220 --> 00:59:55,670
yeah,

2267
00:59:55,670 --> 00:59:56,330
I agree.

2268
00:59:56,330 --> 00:59:58,370
He's a tougher fight at 55 I mean,

2269
00:59:58,430 --> 01:00:00,020
I think you fight better
when he's lighter.

2270
01:00:00,050 --> 01:00:00,500
You know,

2271
01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:01,970
it's probably sucks to get down there,

2272
01:00:01,971 --> 01:00:03,770
but your lighter and you
move faster is better.

2273
01:00:03,771 --> 01:00:05,690
Cardio is going to be a good fight,

2274
01:00:05,691 --> 01:00:05,840
man.

2275
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:06,740
This will be a good fight.

2276
01:00:06,950 --> 01:00:08,670
Kenny Robertson and Hong Kong narrow.

2277
01:00:08,700 --> 01:00:11,780
I'm going to watch 30 seconds with
a nice knee to the body there.

2278
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:15,610
So I think what I love about Connor is it,

2279
01:00:15,611 --> 01:00:16,510
that's what he wants to do.

2280
01:00:16,511 --> 01:00:18,310
I don't think he could make 45 anymore.

2281
01:00:18,350 --> 01:00:20,030
I mean either there's
camp says he can either.

2282
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:22,360
It's just too hard to match so bad.

2283
01:00:22,361 --> 01:00:23,620
He has the 45 belt.

2284
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:27,480
He just beat Nate at 70 then let's
say he Merck's Eddie Alvarez,

2285
01:00:27,481 --> 01:00:29,530
so he's the one 45 one 55 champ.

2286
01:00:29,620 --> 01:00:31,180
What then what do you do?

2287
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:32,680
I kind of want to see him rematch.

2288
01:00:32,681 --> 01:00:35,050
All though though I kind
of do a kind of honesty.

2289
01:00:35,090 --> 01:00:39,760
Don't fight again at 45 it nothing that
when they say it's too tough for him now

2290
01:00:40,620 --> 01:00:41,230
and stuff,

2291
01:00:41,230 --> 01:00:42,520
corneal got their back.

2292
01:00:42,850 --> 01:00:43,750
This is no good.

2293
01:00:43,810 --> 01:00:43,961
Ooh,

2294
01:00:43,961 --> 01:00:44,771
I like high butterflies.

2295
01:00:44,771 --> 01:00:49,771
That back leg on Max took
it that way to the back.

2296
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:51,251
Ooh,

2297
01:00:51,251 --> 01:00:51,581
look at that.

2298
01:00:51,581 --> 01:00:52,360
Squeeze.

2299
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:53,470
That's nice control.

2300
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:56,440
I think there's better fight at
45 when you think of all though.

2301
01:00:56,441 --> 01:00:57,600
Max Holloway Shit.

2302
01:00:58,180 --> 01:00:58,361
Oh,

2303
01:00:58,361 --> 01:00:58,691
Kenny.

2304
01:00:58,691 --> 01:00:59,321
Good job.

2305
01:00:59,321 --> 01:01:00,154
Recovering.

2306
01:01:00,580 --> 01:01:01,560
Still still babbling.

2307
01:01:01,870 --> 01:01:02,080
Oh,

2308
01:01:02,080 --> 01:01:04,110
he goes deep half.

2309
01:01:04,900 --> 01:01:05,733
Oh Shit.

2310
01:01:06,040 --> 01:01:06,810
Go narrow.

2311
01:01:06,810 --> 01:01:07,220
Oh,

2312
01:01:07,220 --> 01:01:08,590
Kimmy Robertson with that wrestling.

2313
01:01:09,550 --> 01:01:10,383
Very nice.

2314
01:01:10,390 --> 01:01:11,260
Nice escape.

2315
01:01:12,610 --> 01:01:14,350
Kenny Roberts has got
some weird hand movements.

2316
01:01:14,351 --> 01:01:15,700
He does right before he punches.

2317
01:01:15,701 --> 01:01:16,450
You know,

2318
01:01:16,450 --> 01:01:17,730
he like key let's Danish.

2319
01:01:17,850 --> 01:01:18,221
Yeah.

2320
01:01:18,221 --> 01:01:20,370
He lets his hands go limp and her around.

2321
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:22,060
I wonder if he does that on purpose.

2322
01:01:22,061 --> 01:01:23,590
So when there's a strategy behind that,

2323
01:01:25,740 --> 01:01:28,800
like maybe to remind
himself to fight loose.

2324
01:01:29,100 --> 01:01:29,933
Hmm.

2325
01:01:30,540 --> 01:01:31,620
Or maybe it's just a tick.

2326
01:01:31,650 --> 01:01:32,370
Yeah.

2327
01:01:32,370 --> 01:01:32,791
Maybe it was like,

2328
01:01:32,791 --> 01:01:32,881
oh,

2329
01:01:32,881 --> 01:01:33,714
this twitches

2330
01:01:36,590 --> 01:01:38,100
on his hands when he was fun.

2331
01:01:38,101 --> 01:01:38,934
Yeah.

2332
01:01:39,900 --> 01:01:40,733
For relax.

2333
01:01:41,100 --> 01:01:41,850
I can relax.

2334
01:01:41,850 --> 01:01:42,683
Yeah.

2335
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:45,473
Pancreas.

2336
01:01:45,540 --> 01:01:47,010
That's so easy said than done.

2337
01:01:47,790 --> 01:01:50,400
Especially when you're finding someone
that just constantly puts pressure on

2338
01:01:50,401 --> 01:01:51,234
you.

2339
01:01:54,750 --> 01:01:55,340
Okay.

2340
01:01:55,340 --> 01:01:55,690
But that,

2341
01:01:55,690 --> 01:01:57,110
going back to that cardio thing,

2342
01:01:57,111 --> 01:01:57,740
man,

2343
01:01:57,740 --> 01:02:01,970
when two guys are skillfully
like very similar,

2344
01:02:02,090 --> 01:02:07,090
but one guy's just got some stupendous
Marv Marinovich style gas tank and he

2345
01:02:08,721 --> 01:02:09,560
knows how to fight,

2346
01:02:09,740 --> 01:02:13,880
but now he's just got this unbelievable
gas tank talking about that Cain

2347
01:02:13,880 --> 01:02:14,180
Velasquez.

2348
01:02:14,180 --> 01:02:14,421
Yeah.

2349
01:02:14,421 --> 01:02:14,631
Like,

2350
01:02:14,631 --> 01:02:14,811
well,

2351
01:02:14,811 --> 01:02:16,490
Kane knows how to fight obviously,

2352
01:02:16,970 --> 01:02:20,210
but with the scariest thing
about Kane is the volume he puts

2353
01:02:20,220 --> 01:02:21,510
cardio's at heavyweight.

2354
01:02:21,690 --> 01:02:22,523
It's insane,

2355
01:02:23,340 --> 01:02:23,671
dude.

2356
01:02:23,671 --> 01:02:24,504
You tell me,

2357
01:02:24,990 --> 01:02:29,400
you tell me a better heavyweight match
up besides maybe Uber reman Brock besides

2358
01:02:29,401 --> 01:02:30,510
steep avers Kane.

2359
01:02:30,660 --> 01:02:32,910
That's the fucking fight of the century,

2360
01:02:32,911 --> 01:02:33,450
son.

2361
01:02:33,450 --> 01:02:34,283
It's amazing.

2362
01:02:34,560 --> 01:02:39,560
Besides a roid to the Dick Overeem
versa judge juiced up Brock,

2363
01:02:40,441 --> 01:02:41,520
which I was calling for.

2364
01:02:41,521 --> 01:02:41,791
I was like,

2365
01:02:41,791 --> 01:02:42,624
Oh hell yeah,

2366
01:02:42,900 --> 01:02:43,733
that was sick.

2367
01:02:43,890 --> 01:02:44,360
But uh,

2368
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:44,910
uh,

2369
01:02:44,910 --> 01:02:47,000
supplement free cane for something free.

2370
01:02:47,010 --> 01:02:49,110
Steep a sign me up.

2371
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:49,770
Yeah,

2372
01:02:49,770 --> 01:02:50,730
it's a great fight.

2373
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:52,110
They're very similar man.

2374
01:02:52,190 --> 01:02:52,691
Steve Bay.

2375
01:02:52,691 --> 01:02:54,330
So gangster out of the two,

2376
01:02:54,331 --> 01:02:57,570
which was rather see the to city to city.

2377
01:03:00,690 --> 01:03:01,523
I'm not trying,

2378
01:03:02,560 --> 01:03:02,720
no,

2379
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:02,821
no,

2380
01:03:02,821 --> 01:03:03,001
no,

2381
01:03:03,001 --> 01:03:03,221
not,

2382
01:03:03,221 --> 01:03:05,300
not in 2016 or 2017.

2383
01:03:05,350 --> 01:03:08,190
I'm trying to see juiced up
rain verse juiced up Brock.

2384
01:03:08,191 --> 01:03:08,540
Now.

2385
01:03:08,540 --> 01:03:08,670
Well,

2386
01:03:08,670 --> 01:03:09,880
if they hadn't had that first fight,

2387
01:03:09,881 --> 01:03:12,930
I would you bring them back
to the same place they were.

2388
01:03:13,530 --> 01:03:14,610
Same place they were at the time.

2389
01:03:14,610 --> 01:03:15,160
I agree.

2390
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:16,740
That first fight in the UFC,

2391
01:03:16,741 --> 01:03:17,150
you know what,

2392
01:03:17,150 --> 01:03:19,200
Brock making a comeback
after losing his title.

2393
01:03:19,390 --> 01:03:19,921
I disagree.

2394
01:03:19,921 --> 01:03:20,910
Steve Avers Keynes,

2395
01:03:20,911 --> 01:03:21,691
the fucking fine.

2396
01:03:21,691 --> 01:03:22,740
You don't have to disagree.

2397
01:03:22,741 --> 01:03:23,574
We just have,

2398
01:03:23,820 --> 01:03:26,820
we want different things out of
this world would be a disagreement.

2399
01:03:26,850 --> 01:03:28,020
I want nothing wrong with that.

2400
01:03:28,021 --> 01:03:28,860
I want you city

2401
01:03:30,680 --> 01:03:32,190
to city on a football field.

2402
01:03:32,220 --> 01:03:33,053
How I'm to

2403
01:03:35,650 --> 01:03:36,870
on a football field,

2404
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:43,740
I think the cage is an artificial boundary
and I think it plays a big factor in

2405
01:03:43,741 --> 01:03:45,840
movement and a big factor in the fight.

2406
01:03:46,230 --> 01:03:48,630
I mean how much fucking
foot work do you need?

2407
01:03:49,080 --> 01:03:52,070
25 foot or 30 foot came
as if they have 30 feats.

2408
01:03:52,100 --> 01:03:52,970
A big case

2409
01:03:54,710 --> 01:03:56,310
you could have the cage the way it is.

2410
01:03:56,340 --> 01:03:59,830
Where did they start to have a border
where if you pass that border you've got

2411
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:00,840
to get back inside.

2412
01:04:01,410 --> 01:04:03,990
So the cage never becomes a factor.

2413
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:08,460
So like if you're fighting and you take
a guy down and he know his ass scoots

2414
01:04:08,461 --> 01:04:09,330
outside of the,

2415
01:04:09,331 --> 01:04:09,530
the,

2416
01:04:09,530 --> 01:04:10,620
the boundary line,

2417
01:04:10,621 --> 01:04:11,454
but there's still,

2418
01:04:11,510 --> 01:04:11,730
you know,

2419
01:04:11,730 --> 01:04:13,290
50 feet in any one direction.

2420
01:04:13,291 --> 01:04:14,550
If someone's driving forward,

2421
01:04:14,551 --> 01:04:15,420
you take that guy,

2422
01:04:15,540 --> 01:04:19,440
you move into the middle of the cage or
the middle of the mat and you assume the

2423
01:04:19,441 --> 01:04:20,274
same position.

2424
01:04:20,820 --> 01:04:21,653
That's not hard to do.

2425
01:04:21,690 --> 01:04:23,160
They did that in pride all day long.

2426
01:04:23,270 --> 01:04:24,001
They could do that.

2427
01:04:24,001 --> 01:04:24,780
They have replaced,

2428
01:04:24,780 --> 01:04:26,460
they can see exactly
where it guy was set up.

2429
01:04:26,610 --> 01:04:27,510
The referee holds on,

2430
01:04:27,511 --> 01:04:27,991
I'm ready,

2431
01:04:27,991 --> 01:04:28,441
set,

2432
01:04:28,441 --> 01:04:28,980
fight,

2433
01:04:28,980 --> 01:04:30,270
and you go back to fighting again.

2434
01:04:30,390 --> 01:04:34,590
That way there's never any artificial
cage that's in the way that helps you get

2435
01:04:34,591 --> 01:04:35,550
back up to your feet.

2436
01:04:35,970 --> 01:04:37,670
Everybody would have way harder,

2437
01:04:37,700 --> 01:04:40,950
way harder time getting back up to
their feet if there was no cage.

2438
01:04:40,980 --> 01:04:42,120
If you couldn't wall walk,

2439
01:04:42,750 --> 01:04:43,980
it's a big guy that take Tatum.

2440
01:04:44,460 --> 01:04:45,293
Oh yeah,

2441
01:04:45,930 --> 01:04:46,530
yeah,

2442
01:04:46,530 --> 01:04:47,050
yeah.

2443
01:04:47,050 --> 01:04:48,210
The dropdown.

2444
01:04:48,270 --> 01:04:50,130
Scoop your hands together
because the guy can't move.

2445
01:04:50,131 --> 01:04:51,990
He can't keep backing
up and pummeling under,

2446
01:04:52,020 --> 01:04:55,400
but it's hard to take guys down when
they're against the fence and they're just

2447
01:04:55,500 --> 01:04:56,360
her at the fence.

2448
01:04:56,570 --> 01:04:57,660
The two part to that,

2449
01:04:57,680 --> 01:04:58,200
right.

2450
01:04:58,200 --> 01:04:59,220
If the fence wasn't there,

2451
01:04:59,221 --> 01:05:00,580
they'd get you down.

2452
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:01,480
Easy a check.

2453
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:02,790
It's a factor.

2454
01:05:03,070 --> 01:05:04,170
The cage is a fact.

2455
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:05,130
I liked that factor.

2456
01:05:05,220 --> 01:05:06,053
It's part of the game.

2457
01:05:06,170 --> 01:05:06,311
Yeah,

2458
01:05:06,311 --> 01:05:07,144
me too.

2459
01:05:07,250 --> 01:05:09,390
There needs to be board fence,

2460
01:05:09,391 --> 01:05:10,260
wrestling sport.

2461
01:05:10,310 --> 01:05:15,300
Like I don't watch Nascar Elevator,

2462
01:05:15,310 --> 01:05:17,980
funny guy down and the guys got to use

2463
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:18,300
the fence.

2464
01:05:18,300 --> 01:05:19,100
I have to get taken down.

2465
01:05:19,100 --> 01:05:21,100
You got to like a minute to
take him down or something.

2466
01:05:21,101 --> 01:05:24,430
The guys that get really good at
that translate to MMA a lot better.

2467
01:05:24,431 --> 01:05:24,910
Right?

2468
01:05:24,910 --> 01:05:25,241
Yeah.

2469
01:05:25,241 --> 01:05:25,990
Maybe.

2470
01:05:25,990 --> 01:05:28,960
I think that we would be better
off though if it wasn't a factor,

2471
01:05:29,140 --> 01:05:30,730
but just think that's not going to happen.

2472
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:32,050
We just think it's too late for that.

2473
01:05:32,120 --> 01:05:32,891
Thinks what I think.

2474
01:05:32,891 --> 01:05:37,891
I think fighting as a sport should be
as pure as possible and it's not as pure

2475
01:05:38,441 --> 01:05:39,430
as possible.

2476
01:05:39,550 --> 01:05:42,100
I think kicks on the
ground soccer kick stomps.

2477
01:05:42,220 --> 01:05:43,053
No cage,

2478
01:05:43,330 --> 01:05:44,430
no gloves about mouthpiece.

2479
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:44,890
Yeah.

2480
01:05:44,890 --> 01:05:45,550
Yes.

2481
01:05:45,550 --> 01:05:47,740
Mouthpieces didn't have you get punched.

2482
01:05:47,741 --> 01:05:49,570
It's going to go straight
through your fucking lips,

2483
01:05:49,720 --> 01:05:51,930
your teeth go through your and stuff.

2484
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:55,240
Bacteria [inaudible] staff.

2485
01:05:56,250 --> 01:05:57,370
I could see it coming now.

2486
01:05:57,450 --> 01:05:58,570
He could get staff on your knuckles.

2487
01:05:58,571 --> 01:06:01,600
So that is a good point because when
guys punch guys with bare teeth,

2488
01:06:01,630 --> 01:06:02,441
like in street fights,

2489
01:06:02,441 --> 01:06:04,160
they get staff all the times.

2490
01:06:04,330 --> 01:06:05,270
More common than you'd think.

2491
01:06:05,310 --> 01:06:07,590
It's real dangerous if you
don't treat it just broke.

2492
01:06:07,591 --> 01:06:09,460
My hand falls off gang green and shit.

2493
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:09,760
Ooh,

2494
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:10,593
that's nasty.

2495
01:06:10,660 --> 01:06:12,070
Human mouth is gross,

2496
01:06:12,580 --> 01:06:15,070
but just between the cage and
the soccer kicks on the ground,

2497
01:06:15,071 --> 01:06:17,500
how the different the sport
would evolve in five years.

2498
01:06:17,501 --> 01:06:20,830
It would change how different kicks in
the ground techniques you guys would be

2499
01:06:20,831 --> 01:06:21,131
using.

2500
01:06:21,131 --> 01:06:23,230
Everything that you'd be doing
kicks on the ground to the face.

2501
01:06:23,231 --> 01:06:27,010
They should already do combos where a
guy's mounted like Vander light used to

2502
01:06:27,011 --> 01:06:27,530
do.

2503
01:06:27,530 --> 01:06:28,363
He'd get them out,

2504
01:06:28,690 --> 01:06:29,740
throw a couple punches,

2505
01:06:29,770 --> 01:06:32,050
then stand up and just stop and walk away.

2506
01:06:32,710 --> 01:06:33,401
That's a combo,

2507
01:06:33,401 --> 01:06:33,551
right?

2508
01:06:33,551 --> 01:06:35,560
If a guy should can upkick you,

2509
01:06:35,590 --> 01:06:36,730
you should be able to stomp him.

2510
01:06:37,020 --> 01:06:37,853
Hundred percent,

2511
01:06:37,990 --> 01:06:41,140
hundred percent changes
the game of Jujitsu,

2512
01:06:41,230 --> 01:06:44,620
like tremendously elbows
to the back of the head.

2513
01:06:45,340 --> 01:06:45,641
Dude,

2514
01:06:45,641 --> 01:06:46,780
you better make a move quick.

2515
01:06:46,780 --> 01:06:48,100
You can't date turtled up.

2516
01:06:48,590 --> 01:06:49,423
Turn on was,

2517
01:06:49,750 --> 01:06:51,810
you should be able to fuck
a dude up for Tertullian.

2518
01:06:52,060 --> 01:06:54,550
How many dudes just get
broken by that though.

2519
01:06:54,670 --> 01:06:56,880
How many careers get caught short?

2520
01:06:57,040 --> 01:06:59,770
You see it coming and like
after a while the rep would go,

2521
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,260
you know if you do this can
hold it for three seconds.

2522
01:07:02,261 --> 01:07:03,100
And the guy didn't move.

2523
01:07:03,510 --> 01:07:04,241
He stopped the fight.

2524
01:07:04,241 --> 01:07:04,451
You know what?

2525
01:07:04,451 --> 01:07:05,630
I have to connect

2526
01:07:07,310 --> 01:07:10,330
Gary Goodrich and that was
that one of his page or fights.

2527
01:07:10,340 --> 01:07:11,640
He got them in the fucking crucifix.

2528
01:07:11,650 --> 01:07:12,483
Just doubled.

2529
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:15,490
That was probably the
worst Nacada version.

2530
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:20,520
I was thinking when Gary Goodrich grabbed
the guy's Dick crushed the Pedro dude

2531
01:07:21,371 --> 01:07:22,200
in Brazil.

2532
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:24,820
He reached into his pants and grabbed
his dick and balls and crushed,

2533
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:25,713
crushed

2534
01:07:26,950 --> 01:07:28,900
peanut butter them.

2535
01:07:29,210 --> 01:07:30,040
They actually happen.

2536
01:07:30,040 --> 01:07:30,161
Yeah,

2537
01:07:30,161 --> 01:07:30,994
there's no rules.

2538
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:31,810
There's no rules.

2539
01:07:31,810 --> 01:07:33,130
Zero sweaty and shit.

2540
01:07:33,131 --> 01:07:34,770
Just put it's rest of nuts.

2541
01:07:36,250 --> 01:07:38,680
Brazilians like wearing
those pro wrestling briefs.

2542
01:07:39,290 --> 01:07:39,640
Gary.

2543
01:07:39,640 --> 01:07:40,473
Good

2544
01:07:41,770 --> 01:07:43,060
vicious growing attacks.

2545
01:07:43,630 --> 01:07:44,380
Yeah.

2546
01:07:44,380 --> 01:07:44,670
Damn,

2547
01:07:44,670 --> 01:07:45,503
Jamie's good.

2548
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:46,540
That's after the fight is trying to,

2549
01:07:46,541 --> 01:07:46,961
hey man,

2550
01:07:46,961 --> 01:07:47,890
you know I'm just doing my phone.

2551
01:07:49,030 --> 01:07:50,910
Sorry about that thing.

2552
01:07:51,540 --> 01:07:54,790
Crabs are like the squoze
your balls and Dick.

2553
01:07:56,500 --> 01:07:56,890
Yeah,

2554
01:07:56,890 --> 01:07:57,723
that's not good.

2555
01:07:58,090 --> 01:08:00,910
So Kenny Robertson on top
horn Carnero on the bottom,

2556
01:08:00,911 --> 01:08:02,140
looking for the arm triangle,

2557
01:08:02,230 --> 01:08:03,070
not pulling it off.

2558
01:08:03,370 --> 01:08:06,520
It's going to be hard to do anything
excited for Uriah Hall Brunson.

2559
01:08:06,550 --> 01:08:07,130
Me Too.

2560
01:08:07,130 --> 01:08:09,010
He's coming after Eddie in this position.

2561
01:08:09,011 --> 01:08:09,251
Right?

2562
01:08:09,251 --> 01:08:09,471
You,

2563
01:08:09,471 --> 01:08:10,031
you want to,

2564
01:08:10,031 --> 01:08:12,140
you want an under hook on that
side right there on the bottom.

2565
01:08:12,141 --> 01:08:14,590
It has the half guard bottom
wants to get the under hook.

2566
01:08:14,900 --> 01:08:16,050
Obviously the guy on top on her

2567
01:08:16,050 --> 01:08:19,550
to keep that under hook and keep that
head and arm and Cornell went right to us.

2568
01:08:19,580 --> 01:08:20,301
He knows what he's doing.

2569
01:08:20,301 --> 01:08:20,510
Yeah,

2570
01:08:20,510 --> 01:08:21,350
you went right to it.

2571
01:08:21,410 --> 01:08:22,201
Went right to that again.

2572
01:08:22,201 --> 01:08:22,610
The Cook,

2573
01:08:22,610 --> 01:08:23,221
he's not planned.

2574
01:08:23,221 --> 01:08:24,054
It's pretty definitely.

2575
01:08:24,680 --> 01:08:25,130
Yeah.

2576
01:08:25,130 --> 01:08:26,150
He's super talented.

2577
01:08:26,180 --> 01:08:26,960
Super talented.

2578
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:28,340
I was gonna say Alex Davis,

2579
01:08:28,370 --> 01:08:29,450
you've got to make that move.

2580
01:08:29,660 --> 01:08:31,760
Was telling me about rolling with them.

2581
01:08:31,761 --> 01:08:32,030
Went on.

2582
01:08:32,030 --> 01:08:32,970
What a nightmare at night.

2583
01:08:33,590 --> 01:08:34,020
Yeah.

2584
01:08:34,020 --> 01:08:35,240
I've got to get in there and go.

2585
01:08:35,241 --> 01:08:36,074
He's got to go on.

2586
01:08:37,580 --> 01:08:38,391
This is the difference.

2587
01:08:38,391 --> 01:08:41,400
That change is straight grappling and
grapple and a dude like Kenny Robertson's

2588
01:08:41,420 --> 01:08:42,650
a lot of punch you in the face,

2589
01:08:43,130 --> 01:08:45,680
elbow you in the face changes everything.

2590
01:08:45,710 --> 01:08:46,131
Oh,

2591
01:08:46,131 --> 01:08:46,831
there it goes.

2592
01:08:46,831 --> 01:08:47,620
Let's go to the leg.

2593
01:08:47,620 --> 01:08:48,300
Oh Shit.

2594
01:08:48,300 --> 01:08:48,540
Oh,

2595
01:08:48,540 --> 01:08:53,540
can I do it all has Slippy slips
every night for that paypal.

2596
01:08:54,740 --> 01:08:56,960
He's mounted bell.

2597
01:08:57,630 --> 01:08:57,770
Oh,

2598
01:08:57,770 --> 01:08:58,011
good.

2599
01:08:58,011 --> 01:09:00,460
Shrimp Butterfly.

2600
01:09:02,210 --> 01:09:03,043
Now,

2601
01:09:03,530 --> 01:09:05,660
now this is where our rubber
guard comes into play.

2602
01:09:06,170 --> 01:09:06,590
Left,

2603
01:09:06,590 --> 01:09:08,120
right arm pinned to the mat.

2604
01:09:08,930 --> 01:09:11,120
I'm not sure he has the
flexibility to play right,

2605
01:09:11,121 --> 01:09:11,600
but,

2606
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:13,760
but if he could to good place for it,

2607
01:09:14,100 --> 01:09:15,230
that Eddie knowledge,

2608
01:09:15,231 --> 01:09:16,064
he could,

2609
01:09:16,380 --> 01:09:18,710
but he's a friend of mine,

2610
01:09:20,500 --> 01:09:21,333
but

2611
01:09:23,310 --> 01:09:26,660
they're not working for him
or maybe he never went to it.

2612
01:09:26,661 --> 01:09:29,270
That flexibility son
Joe Rubber Guard play.

2613
01:09:29,271 --> 01:09:30,200
They go to a right away.

2614
01:09:30,201 --> 01:09:31,070
Like you could just tell that

2615
01:09:33,110 --> 01:09:35,570
he's trying to set it off off of
risk control and the left arm.

2616
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:36,433
Nothing wrong with that.

2617
01:09:36,650 --> 01:09:38,210
As long as you keep that clench,

2618
01:09:38,270 --> 01:09:39,470
it's keeping that right arm tight.

2619
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:40,371
Oh look at this.

2620
01:09:40,371 --> 01:09:41,150
Good adjust.

2621
01:09:41,150 --> 01:09:41,983
Good adjust.

2622
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,250
Oh look what he's doing there.

2623
01:09:44,690 --> 01:09:45,523
Their style.

2624
01:09:45,770 --> 01:09:46,541
That's like a,

2625
01:09:46,541 --> 01:09:48,500
a rat guard right there.

2626
01:09:49,490 --> 01:09:50,990
There's a guard called rat garden.

2627
01:09:50,991 --> 01:09:52,600
He's the rest.

2628
01:09:52,610 --> 01:09:53,331
Go add it up.

2629
01:09:53,331 --> 01:09:53,901
Wrap it up.

2630
01:09:53,901 --> 01:09:54,830
Pass that elbow.

2631
01:09:55,350 --> 01:09:56,870
We're trying to go past that right elbow,

2632
01:09:56,871 --> 01:09:57,950
but he's not sure how to commit.

2633
01:09:58,560 --> 01:09:59,291
Oh God.

2634
01:09:59,291 --> 01:10:01,230
Am I doing dance?

2635
01:10:02,810 --> 01:10:03,710
Oh my God.

2636
01:10:03,711 --> 01:10:04,790
That was amazing.

2637
01:10:05,030 --> 01:10:06,330
Successful wrap there.

2638
01:10:06,790 --> 01:10:07,170
Yeah,

2639
01:10:07,170 --> 01:10:09,830
I gotta look into that and he
goes into a mounted triangle.

2640
01:10:09,930 --> 01:10:11,060
He looked hurt too.

2641
01:10:11,210 --> 01:10:11,451
Yeah,

2642
01:10:11,451 --> 01:10:13,270
that's face did not fit it.

2643
01:10:13,330 --> 01:10:14,330
Look Fun Dude.

2644
01:10:14,331 --> 01:10:19,190
I need to learn that rat guard is
actually the guy who made it up.

2645
01:10:19,220 --> 01:10:19,971
I forget his name.

2646
01:10:19,971 --> 01:10:20,900
Destination Believer.

2647
01:10:21,240 --> 01:10:22,320
But anyways,

2648
01:10:22,350 --> 01:10:22,640
it's,

2649
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:23,090
it's,

2650
01:10:23,090 --> 01:10:27,890
he's been doing it for like now 10 years
now and he always called it a rubber

2651
01:10:27,891 --> 01:10:29,510
guard for guys that have no flexibility.

2652
01:10:29,511 --> 01:10:30,770
Cause I think he had an accident.

2653
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:32,030
He had an accident at hips.

2654
01:10:32,070 --> 01:10:34,910
All fucked up stuff with
Rohan was doing right there.

2655
01:10:35,070 --> 01:10:36,230
That's legit shit.

2656
01:10:36,590 --> 01:10:37,423
It worked.

2657
01:10:37,430 --> 01:10:37,701
I mean,

2658
01:10:37,701 --> 01:10:38,391
look what it did.

2659
01:10:38,391 --> 01:10:40,160
It changed the teacher telling me too.

2660
01:10:40,161 --> 01:10:40,690
It's real.

2661
01:10:40,690 --> 01:10:42,070
Those are times where I'm like,

2662
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:42,650
I dunno,

2663
01:10:42,650 --> 01:10:43,130
he's looking for that.

2664
01:10:43,130 --> 01:10:43,790
I'm triangle.

2665
01:10:43,790 --> 01:10:44,623
Look at that.

2666
01:10:46,090 --> 01:10:47,790
I was going to try and go for a on now,

2667
01:10:47,791 --> 01:10:49,190
but I got it right there.

2668
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:51,150
That's the master rat.

2669
01:10:51,230 --> 01:10:52,250
Jamie needs a raise.

2670
01:10:52,310 --> 01:10:55,010
God Damn Jamie is on the ball.

2671
01:10:55,080 --> 01:10:59,570
God Damn fucking extra fuck man.

2672
01:10:59,630 --> 01:11:00,320
Coffee Son.

2673
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:01,390
But now he turns it off.

2674
01:11:01,400 --> 01:11:03,800
Now I take back what I said.

2675
01:11:05,240 --> 01:11:06,030
So this is a,

2676
01:11:06,030 --> 01:11:09,590
this is rat guard so that it's
second round has got the grip down.

2677
01:11:12,380 --> 01:11:13,410
Hi Rat was,

2678
01:11:14,310 --> 01:11:15,240
it sounds very rat.

2679
01:11:15,241 --> 01:11:16,470
Like listen.

2680
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:17,070
Um,

2681
01:11:17,070 --> 01:11:19,440
I have actually a damaged leg.

2682
01:11:19,740 --> 01:11:22,710
So you notice I had certain
angles I can't play in this.

2683
01:11:22,890 --> 01:11:27,890
I developed the light guard
as an alternative to the
rubber guard because I have

2684
01:11:29,700 --> 01:11:30,890
paralysis in my life.

2685
01:11:31,740 --> 01:11:34,680
So what I'm going to
do is most people play.

2686
01:11:34,681 --> 01:11:35,150
Look,

2687
01:11:35,150 --> 01:11:37,670
there's no way we're watching this whole
thing just while we're in the middle,

2688
01:11:37,680 --> 01:11:38,790
just troll.

2689
01:11:38,900 --> 01:11:40,760
Just the first thing he
does the first thing,

2690
01:11:40,761 --> 01:11:41,481
if you hate race,

2691
01:11:41,481 --> 01:11:41,811
watched,

2692
01:11:41,811 --> 01:11:42,260
watch.

2693
01:11:42,260 --> 01:11:43,093
Yeah.

2694
01:11:43,280 --> 01:11:45,300
Just that first little controlling show.

2695
01:11:45,301 --> 01:11:45,970
A whole rack.

2696
01:11:45,970 --> 01:11:46,220
Yeah.

2697
01:11:46,220 --> 01:11:51,220
Video and my legs and put my hand on
his year and push as if I'm going for

2698
01:11:51,951 --> 01:11:52,784
getting,

2699
01:11:52,790 --> 01:11:53,121
however,

2700
01:11:53,121 --> 01:11:58,121
I'm not going for you to grabbing my
Shin here or am my leg under here.

2701
01:11:58,410 --> 01:11:59,700
That's exactly what he was doing.

2702
01:11:59,810 --> 01:12:00,643
Yeah.

2703
01:12:00,850 --> 01:12:01,980
And then he swept them with it,

2704
01:12:02,340 --> 01:12:02,730
right?

2705
01:12:02,730 --> 01:12:03,510
I go here.

2706
01:12:03,510 --> 01:12:05,550
They swept in with and he
turned it into a triangle.

2707
01:12:05,630 --> 01:12:07,680
[inaudible] elbow down.

2708
01:12:07,740 --> 01:12:08,100
Okay,

2709
01:12:08,100 --> 01:12:08,820
here we go.

2710
01:12:08,820 --> 01:12:10,850
Round three powerful rat pastor.

2711
01:12:11,190 --> 01:12:11,731
Oh Shit.

2712
01:12:11,731 --> 01:12:12,750
That's going to blow up now.

2713
01:12:12,810 --> 01:12:13,650
That's interesting.

2714
01:12:14,590 --> 01:12:18,660
How Long Carnero on the ball recognizing
all sorts of different moves.

2715
01:12:18,870 --> 01:12:20,820
That's one of the most important
things about your ditzy,

2716
01:12:20,821 --> 01:12:21,091
right?

2717
01:12:21,091 --> 01:12:23,850
Being able to understand all
the new shit that's going on.

2718
01:12:24,750 --> 01:12:25,111
Yeah.

2719
01:12:25,111 --> 01:12:25,980
I never went to it.

2720
01:12:25,981 --> 01:12:28,500
I never bothered playing it only
because I do have the flexibility.

2721
01:12:28,501 --> 01:12:29,370
I didn't need to do that,

2722
01:12:29,371 --> 01:12:31,710
but fuck it seems like
an interesting option.

2723
01:12:31,711 --> 01:12:32,030
Sold.

2724
01:12:32,030 --> 01:12:32,570
No.

2725
01:12:32,570 --> 01:12:32,970
Yeah,

2726
01:12:32,970 --> 01:12:34,110
I'm all over it now.

2727
01:12:34,730 --> 01:12:37,260
I see Cornell is going
to be super nervous now.

2728
01:12:38,040 --> 01:12:43,040
I mean Robertson's gotta be super nervous
now being reversed in a position like

2729
01:12:43,411 --> 01:12:43,680
that.

2730
01:12:43,680 --> 01:12:46,620
Put it in a bag is really good
and he's got good wrestling so,

2731
01:12:47,010 --> 01:12:48,050
oh that was all kind of,

2732
01:12:48,620 --> 01:12:50,170
oh Riverside,

2733
01:12:52,010 --> 01:12:52,890
thank goodness.

2734
01:12:52,920 --> 01:12:53,970
Nice exchange.

2735
01:12:54,060 --> 01:12:55,560
Mice Robertson is,

2736
01:12:55,860 --> 01:13:00,860
oh see this verdict by
get that cardio ups.

2737
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:06,440
I would like to know
like what is the barrier?

2738
01:13:06,480 --> 01:13:08,490
Very best method to prepare.

2739
01:13:08,790 --> 01:13:09,900
I would really like to know,

2740
01:13:09,901 --> 01:13:14,850
like is it possible that Hong Carnero
could have done something different and

2741
01:13:14,851 --> 01:13:18,990
could be like mighty mouse here in this
third round or is it simply a function

2742
01:13:18,991 --> 01:13:21,480
of being 170 pounds being a bigger man,

2743
01:13:21,481 --> 01:13:22,314
cutting the way down.

2744
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:23,260
Is it I,

2745
01:13:23,260 --> 01:13:24,030
I really,

2746
01:13:24,030 --> 01:13:24,271
I would,

2747
01:13:24,271 --> 01:13:26,310
I'm sure genetics or something
to do with it for sure.

2748
01:13:26,311 --> 01:13:26,980
I just want to,

2749
01:13:26,980 --> 01:13:30,690
I always want you to tell your body to
gas and I mean that's what real sprinting

2750
01:13:30,691 --> 01:13:33,780
is to train your body to gas and
recovering gas recovery on a clock.

2751
01:13:33,781 --> 01:13:34,630
Gas Recovery,

2752
01:13:34,740 --> 01:13:35,580
gas recover.

2753
01:13:35,820 --> 01:13:39,450
So you do it so much so you
could be fucking dead tired
and the match and you're

2754
01:13:39,451 --> 01:13:39,631
like,

2755
01:13:39,631 --> 01:13:41,580
I'm going to recover in about 20 seconds.

2756
01:13:41,640 --> 01:13:42,920
The fights are so train your body,

2757
01:13:43,040 --> 01:13:43,650
the nerve,

2758
01:13:43,650 --> 01:13:43,981
she can't.

2759
01:13:43,981 --> 01:13:46,200
It's tough to train it to a t.

2760
01:13:46,201 --> 01:13:47,100
It is little things.

2761
01:13:47,101 --> 01:13:48,240
It was a perfect answer.

2762
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:49,260
It's there's,

2763
01:13:49,650 --> 01:13:50,401
I mean there may be,

2764
01:13:50,401 --> 01:13:52,950
but it's about optimization like right.

2765
01:13:53,070 --> 01:13:54,390
How could you take a guy,

2766
01:13:54,391 --> 01:13:55,920
like whether it's Carnero Oh shit,

2767
01:13:55,921 --> 01:13:58,080
beautiful left hook or anybody,

2768
01:13:58,081 --> 01:14:03,081
any fighter for that matter and train
them physically to like a perfect state,

2769
01:14:03,211 --> 01:14:05,760
like turn Woodley and a
fucking Demetrius Johnson.

2770
01:14:05,761 --> 01:14:06,420
Yeah,

2771
01:14:06,420 --> 01:14:07,380
but will you wouldn't,

2772
01:14:07,430 --> 01:14:10,080
I mean obviously Johnson doesn't have
the kind of horsepower the Woodley has

2773
01:14:10,081 --> 01:14:10,680
either.

2774
01:14:10,680 --> 01:14:11,513
When you have

2775
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:14,410
a huge part of it,

2776
01:14:14,411 --> 01:14:15,161
like the vehicle,

2777
01:14:15,161 --> 01:14:16,400
the vessel you're messing with,

2778
01:14:16,401 --> 01:14:17,770
you can only do so much.

2779
01:14:17,800 --> 01:14:19,630
What I did was swim sprints.

2780
01:14:19,631 --> 01:14:21,820
And what I liked about
that is first of all,

2781
01:14:21,821 --> 01:14:22,654
I hate running,

2782
01:14:22,810 --> 01:14:24,730
but when you're doing swim sprints,

2783
01:14:24,850 --> 01:14:27,070
no matter how exhausted you get,

2784
01:14:27,071 --> 01:14:28,210
like give you 20 of them or whatever,

2785
01:14:28,211 --> 01:14:29,044
that's what I was doing.

2786
01:14:29,140 --> 01:14:29,590
Uh,

2787
01:14:29,590 --> 01:14:31,510
no matter how exhausted you get at 14,

2788
01:14:31,511 --> 01:14:32,410
15 and 16,

2789
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:34,420
when you're sprinting across the pool,

2790
01:14:34,510 --> 01:14:34,920
you're,

2791
01:14:34,920 --> 01:14:36,340
your breathing has to be perfect.

2792
01:14:36,341 --> 01:14:39,210
So there's all this chaos going on
in your head and you're sprinting.

2793
01:14:39,540 --> 01:14:42,220
You're breathing has to be
perfectly swallow water.

2794
01:14:42,720 --> 01:14:43,620
So that,

2795
01:14:43,630 --> 01:14:44,411
that's the beauty.

2796
01:14:44,411 --> 01:14:44,801
And then there's,

2797
01:14:44,801 --> 01:14:45,001
you know,

2798
01:14:45,001 --> 01:14:45,791
the impact,

2799
01:14:45,791 --> 01:14:46,601
there's no impact.

2800
01:14:46,601 --> 01:14:47,830
It's a natural movement.

2801
01:14:48,250 --> 01:14:48,810
And,

2802
01:14:48,810 --> 01:14:49,150
uh,

2803
01:14:49,150 --> 01:14:49,370
it,

2804
01:14:49,370 --> 01:14:49,650
it,

2805
01:14:49,650 --> 01:14:53,200
it makes you focus when you
focus on your breathing,

2806
01:14:53,230 --> 01:14:55,390
when you know you're your worst possible.

2807
01:14:55,850 --> 01:15:00,460
I think also for Jujitsu it's really
good because it's not just leg dependent

2808
01:15:00,820 --> 01:15:01,900
because when you're running,

2809
01:15:01,901 --> 01:15:04,000
it's your arms rarely get tired.

2810
01:15:04,300 --> 01:15:07,300
What's getting tired or your
legs like almost only your legs,

2811
01:15:07,330 --> 01:15:08,680
your lungs and your legs.

2812
01:15:08,980 --> 01:15:11,680
Your arms are obviously playing
a park because you're pumping,

2813
01:15:11,681 --> 01:15:12,490
your arms are moving,

2814
01:15:12,490 --> 01:15:14,680
but they're not getting nearly
as tired as your fucking legs.

2815
01:15:15,210 --> 01:15:16,043
Yeah.

2816
01:15:16,150 --> 01:15:16,781
When you're swimming,

2817
01:15:16,781 --> 01:15:17,980
your arms get tired as fuck.

2818
01:15:18,790 --> 01:15:19,623
Yeah.

2819
01:15:20,200 --> 01:15:21,490
Tiredness to me.

2820
01:15:21,640 --> 01:15:22,750
And if you wear flippers,

2821
01:15:23,020 --> 01:15:24,520
I bet your legs get even more work.

2822
01:15:24,550 --> 01:15:24,950
Right.

2823
01:15:24,950 --> 01:15:28,400
Because all the resistance to do
flippers on the hands to their hands.

2824
01:15:28,590 --> 01:15:30,430
Maurice doggy paddle.

2825
01:15:30,580 --> 01:15:31,600
You don't even have to swim.

2826
01:15:31,630 --> 01:15:32,560
You just have to sprint,

2827
01:15:32,650 --> 01:15:33,041
you know,

2828
01:15:33,041 --> 01:15:33,860
and yeah.

2829
01:15:33,860 --> 01:15:34,080
Yeah.

2830
01:15:34,080 --> 01:15:34,990
That's some bullshit.

2831
01:15:35,020 --> 01:15:35,590
Yeah.

2832
01:15:35,590 --> 01:15:36,423
Yeah.

2833
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:37,420
You really,

2834
01:15:37,420 --> 01:15:38,340
you really need to get,

2835
01:15:38,370 --> 01:15:38,740
if,

2836
01:15:38,740 --> 01:15:41,650
if you want to do it right and get it
with a swim coach so he can get efficient

2837
01:15:42,220 --> 01:15:43,690
and learn how to really do it.

2838
01:15:43,750 --> 01:15:45,550
Ken Robinson coming on strong here.

2839
01:15:46,570 --> 01:15:47,371
Nice Jab my car.

2840
01:15:47,371 --> 01:15:47,661
Narrow.

2841
01:15:47,661 --> 01:15:48,520
You can do it on your own.

2842
01:15:48,520 --> 01:15:49,360
You don't need a trainer.

2843
01:15:49,390 --> 01:15:52,180
The cool thing about swimming is if,

2844
01:15:52,360 --> 01:15:57,020
if you do it on a clock where every
time the clock hits 12 you sprint and

2845
01:15:57,100 --> 01:16:00,550
however it takes you to a long to get
it across the pool could be 25% gains.

2846
01:16:00,551 --> 01:16:01,600
It can be 23 seconds,

2847
01:16:01,601 --> 01:16:02,440
27 seconds.

2848
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:05,530
You rest until that clock hits 12 again.

2849
01:16:05,531 --> 01:16:05,990
So yeah,

2850
01:16:05,990 --> 01:16:09,490
so you ended up doing is you don't
need anybody to tell you to push your

2851
01:16:09,491 --> 01:16:11,140
sprinting for that rest time.

2852
01:16:11,141 --> 01:16:11,470
It's an,

2853
01:16:11,470 --> 01:16:12,370
it's a mind fuck.

2854
01:16:12,670 --> 01:16:17,260
That's the beauty of the sprints and
the water to you're sprinting to rest.

2855
01:16:17,261 --> 01:16:17,741
Cause you know,

2856
01:16:17,741 --> 01:16:19,990
if you fuck up and you just like
kind of give up halfway through,

2857
01:16:20,200 --> 01:16:21,640
you're gonna fuck up the rotation.

2858
01:16:21,641 --> 01:16:22,091
The clock.

2859
01:16:22,091 --> 01:16:23,390
Now you fucked your whole system up there.

2860
01:16:23,400 --> 01:16:23,960
I love swimming.

2861
01:16:23,960 --> 01:16:26,710
You got to do that 20 times across like,

2862
01:16:26,711 --> 01:16:26,921
you know,

2863
01:16:26,921 --> 01:16:28,840
pulled it like you got a 24 hour fitness.

2864
01:16:29,060 --> 01:16:29,620
Um,

2865
01:16:29,620 --> 01:16:30,940
it's like a 20 yard pool.

2866
01:16:30,941 --> 01:16:31,630
20 I dunno,

2867
01:16:31,630 --> 01:16:32,890
maybe 39 the ocean.

2868
01:16:32,891 --> 01:16:33,551
If you're gangster,

2869
01:16:33,551 --> 01:16:34,384
son,

2870
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:34,810
barn,

2871
01:16:34,810 --> 01:16:37,720
Carneros running out of gas
here in the heart and the ocean.

2872
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:39,400
Like where do you stop
and where do you go?

2873
01:16:39,401 --> 01:16:40,234
I'm stopping.

2874
01:16:41,950 --> 01:16:44,620
You got to have a clear
start and stop points.

2875
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:46,810
Yeah.

2876
01:16:46,810 --> 01:16:48,190
Or You just doing it for time.

2877
01:16:48,220 --> 01:16:48,940
Exactly.

2878
01:16:48,940 --> 01:16:50,570
Do it different.

2879
01:16:51,010 --> 01:16:52,480
That's a whole different scenario.

2880
01:16:52,510 --> 01:16:54,070
This is just for pure sprinting.

2881
01:16:54,270 --> 01:16:54,531
Yeah,

2882
01:16:54,531 --> 01:16:55,730
but you're doing off time to,

2883
01:16:55,731 --> 01:16:56,710
it's the 12 right?

2884
01:16:56,830 --> 01:16:59,020
Did they make heart rate
monitors that work in the ocean?

2885
01:16:59,710 --> 01:17:00,090
I Dunno.

2886
01:17:00,090 --> 01:17:02,670
I I bought the new fucking iPhone seven
because I thought it could go to the

2887
01:17:02,680 --> 01:17:03,790
ocean for this reason.

2888
01:17:03,800 --> 01:17:07,390
Then I find out you can't go in the
ocean with the iPhone seven doesn't go in

2889
01:17:07,391 --> 01:17:07,780
the ocean.

2890
01:17:07,780 --> 01:17:08,710
Well that's assault though.

2891
01:17:08,711 --> 01:17:09,200
Right?

2892
01:17:09,200 --> 01:17:10,033
Salt is

2893
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:10,581
really bad.

2894
01:17:10,581 --> 01:17:11,630
Now they say the water,

2895
01:17:11,631 --> 01:17:13,130
like even if you drop in fresh water,

2896
01:17:13,131 --> 01:17:17,690
you have like a couple minutes
to flux are below 30 minutes.

2897
01:17:18,230 --> 01:17:21,620
It's like 30 minutes at
nine feet before cardio.

2898
01:17:21,860 --> 01:17:22,880
Cardio must be nuts.

2899
01:17:22,910 --> 01:17:23,890
Punch people in the face.

2900
01:17:24,390 --> 01:17:25,230
Smoked cigarettes.

2901
01:17:25,720 --> 01:17:26,590
You got a big,

2902
01:17:26,780 --> 01:17:28,010
you got a big fight coming up

2903
01:17:31,650 --> 01:17:32,270
with a,

2904
01:17:32,270 --> 01:17:34,260
I do a lot of running and then we expect,

2905
01:17:34,290 --> 01:17:34,700
yeah.

2906
01:17:34,700 --> 01:17:35,480
Uh,

2907
01:17:35,480 --> 01:17:36,320
how do you set it up?

2908
01:17:36,340 --> 01:17:37,580
Like you don't just go jog,

2909
01:17:38,300 --> 01:17:42,080
I'll jog at least like three days a week
and I'm like three to five miles and

2910
01:17:42,081 --> 01:17:42,890
then uh,

2911
01:17:42,890 --> 01:17:44,840
I'll do sprints like I used to do.

2912
01:17:44,841 --> 01:17:48,650
Like how do you do your sprint
one mile sprint twice a week.

2913
01:17:48,710 --> 01:17:49,543
A full mile.

2914
01:17:49,560 --> 01:17:51,770
It's hard as you can go and I
would try to keep track of that.

2915
01:17:51,771 --> 01:17:52,401
Touch your time.

2916
01:17:52,401 --> 01:17:54,110
So my fastest time ever,

2917
01:17:54,111 --> 01:17:58,370
which I think is still on my Instagram
was like a five 28 or something like

2918
01:17:58,371 --> 01:17:59,150
that's rolling.

2919
01:17:59,150 --> 01:18:03,200
Have you ever had somebody in the car
like next to me yelling at me and like

2920
01:18:03,201 --> 01:18:07,310
keeping me motivated all the time and
just going to have every gas been a fight

2921
01:18:07,311 --> 01:18:09,020
where you lost because
you were just gassed,

2922
01:18:09,110 --> 01:18:10,130
you didn't do proper cardiac.

2923
01:18:10,330 --> 01:18:11,163
Yeah.

2924
01:18:12,680 --> 01:18:13,513
Number of times.

2925
01:18:13,550 --> 01:18:14,420
And then after that you're like,

2926
01:18:14,421 --> 01:18:14,941
fuck that.

2927
01:18:14,941 --> 01:18:15,711
I'm going to get on with your car.

2928
01:18:15,711 --> 01:18:16,610
Who was probably on point,

2929
01:18:16,611 --> 01:18:17,180
next fight.

2930
01:18:17,180 --> 01:18:17,510
Yeah,

2931
01:18:17,510 --> 01:18:17,901
for sure.

2932
01:18:17,901 --> 01:18:18,590
That next fight.

2933
01:18:18,590 --> 01:18:19,041
It's just,

2934
01:18:19,041 --> 01:18:19,790
uh,

2935
01:18:19,790 --> 01:18:20,091
you know,

2936
01:18:20,091 --> 01:18:20,990
there's so many,

2937
01:18:22,100 --> 01:18:23,390
there's so many aspects of your,

2938
01:18:23,391 --> 01:18:24,710
just your daily life,

2939
01:18:24,711 --> 01:18:27,770
they'll fuck up your cardio or fuck up
your training camp where it's like you,

2940
01:18:27,820 --> 01:18:28,431
he was saying like,

2941
01:18:28,431 --> 01:18:28,760
we're,

2942
01:18:28,760 --> 01:18:32,360
if Cornell would have done something
slightly different and it was like maybe

2943
01:18:32,361 --> 01:18:35,560
his girlfriend was pissed
off at him and you know,

2944
01:18:35,630 --> 01:18:36,300
you don't know what,

2945
01:18:36,300 --> 01:18:37,520
what else happened in his life.

2946
01:18:37,540 --> 01:18:38,373
It's just that just be crazy.

2947
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:39,021
And then you're like,

2948
01:18:39,021 --> 01:18:39,171
well,

2949
01:18:39,171 --> 01:18:43,250
did I fuck this up because I didn't
train properly or because my fucking car

2950
01:18:43,251 --> 01:18:44,061
broke down and they couldn't,

2951
01:18:44,061 --> 01:18:44,421
you know,

2952
01:18:44,421 --> 01:18:45,650
whatever else happened in her life.

2953
01:18:45,651 --> 01:18:46,930
So interesting.

2954
01:18:46,960 --> 01:18:49,880
I like keeping peace in your life
with anything you're trying to do.

2955
01:18:50,060 --> 01:18:51,680
If he can keep peace
in your personal life,

2956
01:18:51,681 --> 01:18:52,514
the home life,

2957
01:18:52,830 --> 01:18:54,600
everything man to hit for each,

2958
01:18:54,601 --> 01:18:58,790
I can't tell are you get you get sick or
you broke your fucking toe and now you

2959
01:18:58,791 --> 01:19:00,410
can't run for that last bit.

2960
01:19:00,411 --> 01:19:02,600
There's a lot of guys
who were seeing me so,

2961
01:19:02,601 --> 01:19:04,340
or your shoulder joint was fucked up.

2962
01:19:04,341 --> 01:19:05,840
Now I can't do my sperm sprints.

2963
01:19:05,841 --> 01:19:09,800
And like all the shit that goes along
behind the scenes with fighters is it's

2964
01:19:09,801 --> 01:19:10,041
what,

2965
01:19:10,041 --> 01:19:10,610
uh,

2966
01:19:10,610 --> 01:19:11,443
how many guys do,

2967
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:13,400
especially in entertainment,

2968
01:19:13,430 --> 01:19:17,600
being comedians who were out chasing
tail all the time and they're distracted.

2969
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:18,051
Yeah.

2970
01:19:18,051 --> 01:19:18,740
That'll do it.

2971
01:19:18,740 --> 01:19:19,970
That'll do look at athletes too.

2972
01:19:19,971 --> 01:19:20,271
I know,

2973
01:19:20,271 --> 01:19:22,700
I know athletes who do the
same thing gets in your way.

2974
01:19:23,150 --> 01:19:23,331
Yeah.

2975
01:19:23,331 --> 01:19:24,110
It gets in your way,

2976
01:19:24,110 --> 01:19:25,340
the trip over your own Dick and it all,

2977
01:19:25,341 --> 01:19:26,930
people also use it as an excuse.

2978
01:19:27,220 --> 01:19:27,800
You know,

2979
01:19:27,800 --> 01:19:30,020
they don't do everything they could do.

2980
01:19:30,020 --> 01:19:32,690
So they always have that thing in the
back of their head that there's room for

2981
01:19:32,691 --> 01:19:34,160
improvement and uh,

2982
01:19:34,180 --> 01:19:34,431
yeah,

2983
01:19:34,431 --> 01:19:35,060
next time,

2984
01:19:35,060 --> 01:19:36,200
next time I'll get it together.

2985
01:19:36,470 --> 01:19:37,130
But you know,

2986
01:19:37,130 --> 01:19:38,900
most of the time that
next time never comes.

2987
01:19:39,140 --> 01:19:42,600
Your brain will give you these
sort of escape routes and that,

2988
01:19:42,601 --> 01:19:44,720
that's one of the ones that unfortunately,

2989
01:19:44,790 --> 01:19:45,300
it's,

2990
01:19:45,300 --> 01:19:46,660
it seems so counterintuitive,

2991
01:19:46,790 --> 01:19:47,231
but it happened.

2992
01:19:47,231 --> 01:19:47,961
So a lot of people,

2993
01:19:47,961 --> 01:19:50,930
I've never seen more of it
till I came to La Carnero one

2994
01:19:53,270 --> 01:19:53,570
last,

2995
01:19:53,570 --> 01:19:54,403
that last round.

2996
01:19:54,660 --> 01:19:57,650
Lucy looked like it for what we're seeing,

2997
01:19:57,660 --> 01:19:59,540
because Kenny Robinson
was coming on strong,

2998
01:19:59,541 --> 01:20:01,550
but to take down,

2999
01:20:01,551 --> 01:20:03,820
obviously virtually
didn't mission attempts.

3000
01:20:03,830 --> 01:20:04,370
Yeah.

3001
01:20:04,370 --> 01:20:05,480
Obviously we didn't score it.

3002
01:20:06,470 --> 01:20:08,250
The 30 I thought saw

3003
01:20:08,250 --> 01:20:09,083
I would give to Camaro.

3004
01:20:09,480 --> 01:20:12,420
One of the last round was
what was interesting to me.

3005
01:20:12,421 --> 01:20:16,320
It was because Kenny kept charging after
him and this is where it reversed him.

3006
01:20:17,020 --> 01:20:18,090
Does this on the last round?

3007
01:20:18,091 --> 01:20:18,810
No.

3008
01:20:18,810 --> 01:20:19,321
Beautiful.

3009
01:20:19,321 --> 01:20:20,154
Right hand

3010
01:20:22,950 --> 01:20:24,060
boom with a left hook.

3011
01:20:24,480 --> 01:20:24,721
Yeah.

3012
01:20:24,721 --> 01:20:25,410
It's uh,

3013
01:20:25,410 --> 01:20:25,920
it's hard.

3014
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:26,101
You know,

3015
01:20:26,101 --> 01:20:29,210
we're talking shit while we're
watching these things get barely stuck.

3016
01:20:29,250 --> 01:20:29,731
Really close.

3017
01:20:29,731 --> 01:20:30,430
Cozy.

3018
01:20:30,430 --> 01:20:31,830
I was think about Carl's
junior to be honest.

3019
01:20:31,831 --> 01:20:35,220
That fucking ad got me Carl's
Jr for some junk food right now.

3020
01:20:35,670 --> 01:20:35,880
Yeah.

3021
01:20:35,880 --> 01:20:36,780
I had a little junk food.

3022
01:20:36,781 --> 01:20:39,330
Now I'm fucking cheated a little bit.

3023
01:20:39,360 --> 01:20:39,880
I chill.

3024
01:20:39,880 --> 01:20:40,651
Chill a little bit.

3025
01:20:40,651 --> 01:20:41,510
It would be understanding.

3026
01:20:41,900 --> 01:20:42,733
Do you went off?

3027
01:20:42,780 --> 01:20:44,100
I went off like a rocket.

3028
01:20:44,220 --> 01:20:47,790
I went off like fucking Denzel
Washington flight where he,

3029
01:20:47,791 --> 01:20:49,410
you remember when he got into that movie?

3030
01:20:49,510 --> 01:20:49,951
He didn't see it.

3031
01:20:49,951 --> 01:20:50,080
He,

3032
01:20:50,080 --> 01:20:51,180
he's an alcoholic and they,

3033
01:20:51,300 --> 01:20:53,460
they'd give him a mini fridge
with just tons of stuff.

3034
01:20:53,750 --> 01:20:55,740
Just trying to recap and
just goes fucking nuts.

3035
01:20:56,010 --> 01:20:56,843
That was me.

3036
01:20:56,970 --> 01:20:57,803
Mm.

3037
01:20:57,870 --> 01:20:58,703
Yeah.

3038
01:20:59,310 --> 01:21:00,960
And now I'm back on it.

3039
01:21:00,961 --> 01:21:01,561
Now I hope,

3040
01:21:01,561 --> 01:21:05,520
but what year she'll fucking
took me back to the dark places.

3041
01:21:05,580 --> 01:21:08,040
The problem is if you get off Ketosis,

3042
01:21:08,041 --> 01:21:10,310
you got to do something to get
back on it again on Sunday.

3043
01:21:10,330 --> 01:21:11,250
Get the supplements.

3044
01:21:11,670 --> 01:21:13,140
You take the ketones.

3045
01:21:13,530 --> 01:21:14,363
Yeah.

3046
01:21:14,460 --> 01:21:16,550
He tells us you're doing
like the low carb thing or,

3047
01:21:16,551 --> 01:21:16,800
yeah.

3048
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:17,250
Yeah.

3049
01:21:17,250 --> 01:21:18,750
I've been on it for grip now.

3050
01:21:18,930 --> 01:21:19,400
It done.

3051
01:21:19,400 --> 01:21:20,250
I'm gonna feel great.

3052
01:21:20,310 --> 01:21:20,760
Rather.

3053
01:21:20,760 --> 01:21:21,210
Yeah.

3054
01:21:21,210 --> 01:21:22,470
I'm also not fat anymore,

3055
01:21:22,471 --> 01:21:24,960
so it's a plus,

3056
01:21:25,300 --> 01:21:26,340
but I was happy with that.

3057
01:21:26,370 --> 01:21:26,780
Yeah.

3058
01:21:26,780 --> 01:21:27,870
It's a super plus.

3059
01:21:29,730 --> 01:21:32,100
Rick Glenn Power,

3060
01:21:32,220 --> 01:21:33,060
Evan Dunham,

3061
01:21:34,190 --> 01:21:35,011
Evan Dunham.

3062
01:21:35,011 --> 01:21:36,390
That motherfucker been fighting

3063
01:21:36,710 --> 01:21:37,491
a long time.

3064
01:21:37,491 --> 01:21:38,750
Matt still around,

3065
01:21:39,620 --> 01:21:42,620
still around and phenomenal
Jitsu and just says,

3066
01:21:42,621 --> 01:21:43,580
I want to bang.

3067
01:21:45,080 --> 01:21:45,381
Yeah.

3068
01:21:45,381 --> 01:21:46,820
He's got good striking too though.

3069
01:21:47,070 --> 01:21:49,250
He's tracking his just is phenomenal.

3070
01:21:49,280 --> 01:21:50,113
Yeah,

3071
01:21:50,900 --> 01:21:51,560
real good.

3072
01:21:51,560 --> 01:21:52,393
Yeah.

3073
01:21:53,150 --> 01:21:56,660
It's going to be an interesting for what
is this Batman nonsense or showing us

3074
01:21:56,661 --> 01:21:56,900
in this

3075
01:21:56,900 --> 01:21:58,730
commercial Radio National Batman Day.

3076
01:21:58,960 --> 01:21:59,471
Is it really?

3077
01:21:59,471 --> 01:21:59,591
Yeah.

3078
01:21:59,591 --> 01:22:01,120
My kids were all about it today.

3079
01:22:01,660 --> 01:22:02,493
Nashville,

3080
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:03,633
Batman,

3081
01:22:03,640 --> 01:22:03,780
dude.

3082
01:22:03,780 --> 01:22:05,860
It's National Batman Day that it's like,

3083
01:22:06,490 --> 01:22:06,791
fuck,

3084
01:22:06,791 --> 01:22:07,260
I didn't know.

3085
01:22:07,260 --> 01:22:07,660
Hmm.

3086
01:22:07,660 --> 01:22:08,201
Batman.

3087
01:22:08,201 --> 01:22:08,721
The telltale.

3088
01:22:08,721 --> 01:22:08,940
Yeah.

3089
01:22:08,940 --> 01:22:09,121
Oh,

3090
01:22:09,121 --> 01:22:09,810
so they made it.

3091
01:22:09,810 --> 01:22:12,870
They made a DVD not to a
video game for x bucks.

3092
01:22:12,890 --> 01:22:12,991
Oh,

3093
01:22:12,991 --> 01:22:14,130
it's a video game.

3094
01:22:14,550 --> 01:22:15,480
I played the fuck of that.

3095
01:22:15,481 --> 01:22:19,050
If I didn't have a kid that we just
bought a Batman toy from the day,

3096
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:20,820
worships back.

3097
01:22:21,190 --> 01:22:23,510
His boys love it is National Batman Day.

3098
01:22:24,260 --> 01:22:24,940
I didn't know.

3099
01:22:24,940 --> 01:22:26,430
Like Cheryl told me this morning.

3100
01:22:27,090 --> 01:22:27,923
Wow,

3101
01:22:27,930 --> 01:22:29,560
so what do you get around

3102
01:22:31,630 --> 01:22:32,270
it?

3103
01:22:32,270 --> 01:22:35,460
They're not going to know shit
up and then send me a text.

3104
01:22:35,461 --> 01:22:36,294
Where's your Batman?

3105
01:22:36,380 --> 01:22:37,560
I want to rock the Batman.

3106
01:22:38,100 --> 01:22:39,860
I got the old school Adam West t.

3107
01:22:39,870 --> 01:22:40,970
It's fucking dope.

3108
01:22:41,500 --> 01:22:41,660
Yeah,

3109
01:22:41,660 --> 01:22:42,720
I got it from junk food.

3110
01:22:42,810 --> 01:22:45,850
Did you ever read the story
of a Adam West and Wonderboy,

3111
01:22:45,990 --> 01:22:46,771
whatever his name is,

3112
01:22:46,771 --> 01:22:47,604
boy wonder.

3113
01:22:47,690 --> 01:22:50,630
Just fucking everything
that moves back down.

3114
01:22:51,030 --> 01:22:51,600
Let's have,

3115
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:52,011
Yay.

3116
01:22:52,011 --> 01:22:52,240
Yeah,

3117
01:22:52,240 --> 01:22:52,530
he wrote,

3118
01:22:52,530 --> 01:22:53,880
he wrote a book about it.

3119
01:22:54,270 --> 01:22:58,190
The dude who played Robin wrote a book
about how much pussy they were getting.

3120
01:22:58,650 --> 01:22:59,161
Oh my God.

3121
01:22:59,161 --> 01:22:59,994
I went off.

3122
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:01,633
I mean,

3123
01:23:01,890 --> 01:23:04,210
they were a big daily stories.

3124
01:23:04,260 --> 01:23:05,390
They never talk it.

3125
01:23:05,391 --> 01:23:06,940
Usually they don't talk about that.

3126
01:23:06,941 --> 01:23:08,530
You guys always keep that shit secret.

3127
01:23:08,590 --> 01:23:09,850
Are you telling me Robin was getting,

3128
01:23:09,851 --> 01:23:14,851
plus you have a hard time believing that
Robin was watching Batman fucker gets

3129
01:23:15,521 --> 01:23:16,120
pussy.

3130
01:23:16,120 --> 01:23:16,953
Come on.

3131
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:17,830
Yes.

3132
01:23:17,830 --> 01:23:19,960
If you're on TV around,

3133
01:23:19,961 --> 01:23:20,291
dude,

3134
01:23:20,291 --> 01:23:21,070
it's a wrap.

3135
01:23:21,070 --> 01:23:22,140
He probably got so much pussy.

3136
01:23:22,141 --> 01:23:23,200
He's still catching his breath.

3137
01:23:24,360 --> 01:23:25,860
Got a TV in another year or so.

3138
01:23:25,861 --> 01:23:26,141
He's like,

3139
01:23:26,141 --> 01:23:26,974
I'm not ready.

3140
01:23:27,710 --> 01:23:29,420
I'm just recovering.

3141
01:23:31,360 --> 01:23:32,530
Corey Feldman,

3142
01:23:33,250 --> 01:23:34,130
Corey Feldman,

3143
01:23:35,190 --> 01:23:40,190
he made an appearance on some talk show
and with his band and they're all girls

3144
01:23:40,240 --> 01:23:42,880
and angel suits and he's a
nightmare a fucking night.

3145
01:23:42,940 --> 01:23:43,751
Oh my God.

3146
01:23:43,751 --> 01:23:44,770
I saw that today.

3147
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:46,150
It was incredible.

3148
01:23:46,210 --> 01:23:46,990
It was amazing.

3149
01:23:46,990 --> 01:23:49,930
He said a minor league baseball game
doing the same shit and there was seven

3150
01:23:49,931 --> 01:23:50,740
people.

3151
01:23:50,740 --> 01:23:52,030
That's what we're looking at.

3152
01:23:52,031 --> 01:23:53,080
Right there was that band.

3153
01:23:53,081 --> 01:23:53,911
Holy Shit.

3154
01:23:53,911 --> 01:23:54,460
Worse.

3155
01:23:54,460 --> 01:23:56,350
It's Corey Feldman's angels.

3156
01:23:56,351 --> 01:23:57,184
How could it be worse?

3157
01:23:58,620 --> 01:23:59,180
Please show.

3158
01:23:59,180 --> 01:24:00,013
This is on tape.

3159
01:24:00,070 --> 01:24:00,761
They put them on here.

3160
01:24:00,761 --> 01:24:01,594
I think

3161
01:24:02,700 --> 01:24:04,990
the today show them put
people on the clown.

3162
01:24:05,560 --> 01:24:08,620
He got trolled dance
to start as performance

3163
01:24:13,300 --> 01:24:15,360
viral right up there.

3164
01:24:15,370 --> 01:24:16,121
No one's looking at it,

3165
01:24:16,121 --> 01:24:16,470
right?

3166
01:24:16,470 --> 01:24:17,303
No one will see it.

3167
01:24:17,650 --> 01:24:18,320
You can't play this.

3168
01:24:18,320 --> 01:24:19,680
Just give us a little some something.

3169
01:24:20,200 --> 01:24:20,441
Hey,

3170
01:24:20,441 --> 01:24:20,951
for sure.

3171
01:24:20,951 --> 01:24:23,050
Make loss boys remake and quit doing this.

3172
01:24:23,230 --> 01:24:24,510
Grab ass with these angels.

3173
01:24:24,740 --> 01:24:26,410
You think it's up to him?

3174
01:24:26,530 --> 01:24:27,281
It's not up to him,

3175
01:24:27,281 --> 01:24:28,114
but he could.

3176
01:24:28,300 --> 01:24:28,950
Well yeah,

3177
01:24:28,950 --> 01:24:31,520
it's probably not an easy breezy promo.

3178
01:24:31,780 --> 01:24:36,070
Look at this Michael Bisbing versus
Dan Henderson for the UFC middleweight

3179
01:24:36,071 --> 01:24:36,904
championship.

3180
01:24:36,940 --> 01:24:38,760
This is crazy and insane.

3181
01:24:38,950 --> 01:24:42,490
That's going to be a wild ass fucking
fighting and Manchester cause those Brits

3182
01:24:42,491 --> 01:24:43,960
are going to go bananas.

3183
01:24:44,320 --> 01:24:45,153
Never lost there.

3184
01:24:45,190 --> 01:24:50,190
And also you got to form in terms of just
the fucking who's who monsters fucking

3185
01:24:51,641 --> 01:24:53,330
waiting in the wings with joc.

3186
01:24:53,331 --> 01:24:55,120
Reg Brock cold in Melbourne.

3187
01:24:55,150 --> 01:24:57,140
How about Yoel Romero versus,

3188
01:24:57,730 --> 01:24:59,160
I'm like a one nine tournament.

3189
01:24:59,161 --> 01:25:00,520
What do you guys call a tournament?

3190
01:25:00,521 --> 01:25:04,930
But whoever wins that is
fucking a tournament when
you're next to Joe Schilling.

3191
01:25:05,110 --> 01:25:05,943
I get excited.

3192
01:25:06,580 --> 01:25:06,901
I'm like,

3193
01:25:06,901 --> 01:25:08,570
why the fuck tournament

3194
01:25:12,560 --> 01:25:16,180
real tournament against
the best guys in my mind.

3195
01:25:16,270 --> 01:25:17,103
Did you see uh,

3196
01:25:17,200 --> 01:25:20,430
Jason Wellness and Simon Marcus
here the night she didn't fight.

3197
01:25:20,740 --> 01:25:21,670
I did crazy.

3198
01:25:21,671 --> 01:25:22,390
Right?

3199
01:25:22,390 --> 01:25:23,110
Crazy.

3200
01:25:23,110 --> 01:25:23,831
It was weird.

3201
01:25:23,831 --> 01:25:24,460
How,

3202
01:25:24,460 --> 01:25:25,060
first of all,

3203
01:25:25,060 --> 01:25:25,480
not,

3204
01:25:25,480 --> 01:25:28,150
not weird that wellness knocked him
out cause he can knock anybody out.

3205
01:25:28,300 --> 01:25:30,490
But we're that Simon at
the end of that round,

3206
01:25:30,491 --> 01:25:31,600
when he was letting him punch him,

3207
01:25:32,120 --> 01:25:33,190
was that odd to you?

3208
01:25:34,540 --> 01:25:35,373
Uh,

3209
01:25:35,730 --> 01:25:36,280
yeah.

3210
01:25:36,280 --> 01:25:37,660
I mean Kinda,

3211
01:25:38,020 --> 01:25:38,620
I uh,

3212
01:25:38,620 --> 01:25:39,453
I think Simon,

3213
01:25:40,690 --> 01:25:44,070
I think Simon and his coach had like a
falling out recently and I think it might

3214
01:25:44,080 --> 01:25:46,060
have something to do with him losing.

3215
01:25:46,120 --> 01:25:46,840
Oh yeah.

3216
01:25:46,840 --> 01:25:47,673
That's always

3217
01:25:49,500 --> 01:25:51,780
been like that kind of weight
when you fight Simon is,

3218
01:25:51,790 --> 01:25:54,550
it's like a very like ego based,

3219
01:25:54,551 --> 01:25:55,060
like very,

3220
01:25:55,060 --> 01:25:55,271
oh,

3221
01:25:55,271 --> 01:25:55,900
ego based,

3222
01:25:55,900 --> 01:25:56,321
the right word.

3223
01:25:56,321 --> 01:25:57,190
He's like tough guy.

3224
01:25:57,740 --> 01:25:58,330
Right.

3225
01:25:58,330 --> 01:25:59,141
So even in that fight,

3226
01:25:59,141 --> 01:26:01,320
like when Jason would do well against him,

3227
01:26:01,321 --> 01:26:02,051
wetland shots,

3228
01:26:02,051 --> 01:26:03,970
you would see Simon like blah,

3229
01:26:04,160 --> 01:26:06,440
and then come back with
like this big like a thing.

3230
01:26:06,470 --> 01:26:07,303
And uh,

3231
01:26:07,430 --> 01:26:08,300
I think that's what it was,

3232
01:26:08,301 --> 01:26:09,530
was I'm gonna drop my hands,

3233
01:26:09,531 --> 01:26:10,251
let this guy hit me.

3234
01:26:10,251 --> 01:26:13,080
And it also looked like it was
slowing down and we're a little tired.

3235
01:26:13,090 --> 01:26:13,923
Yeah.

3236
01:26:15,370 --> 01:26:17,510
He's so jack for a fighter,

3237
01:26:17,840 --> 01:26:18,310
you know,

3238
01:26:18,310 --> 01:26:19,250
it's usually very kickboxer.

3239
01:26:19,280 --> 01:26:20,113
Yeah.

3240
01:26:21,920 --> 01:26:22,790
Misha Tate,

3241
01:26:23,300 --> 01:26:24,010
Amanda Nunez.

3242
01:26:24,010 --> 01:26:24,301
Oh No,

3243
01:26:24,301 --> 01:26:24,510
no,

3244
01:26:24,510 --> 01:26:24,891
not her.

3245
01:26:24,891 --> 01:26:25,724
Not Her shit.

3246
01:26:26,030 --> 01:26:26,863
Uh,

3247
01:26:26,950 --> 01:26:27,140
uh,

3248
01:26:27,140 --> 01:26:27,921
who fought died?

3249
01:26:27,921 --> 01:26:28,940
Joanne Calderwood.

3250
01:26:28,970 --> 01:26:29,601
That Brazilian,

3251
01:26:29,601 --> 01:26:30,434
that Yoke Brazilian.

3252
01:26:30,440 --> 01:26:30,831
Oh yeah.

3253
01:26:30,831 --> 01:26:31,071
Yeah.

3254
01:26:31,071 --> 01:26:32,090
Jessica on drudge.

3255
01:26:32,130 --> 01:26:33,590
Holby she's a beast.

3256
01:26:33,620 --> 01:26:35,030
She dropped down to one 15.

3257
01:26:35,240 --> 01:26:36,440
She's fighting at one 35.

3258
01:26:36,441 --> 01:26:38,540
She was too small because
she's only like five,

3259
01:26:38,541 --> 01:26:39,500
three or five to,

3260
01:26:39,501 --> 01:26:41,180
I think she might be five too.

3261
01:26:41,181 --> 01:26:41,660
She's very,

3262
01:26:41,660 --> 01:26:42,360
she might be she,

3263
01:26:42,360 --> 01:26:43,193
you know what?

3264
01:26:43,220 --> 01:26:45,350
Pull that up because she
might not even be five.

3265
01:26:45,440 --> 01:26:46,500
She might be like five feet tall.

3266
01:26:46,501 --> 01:26:47,210
A little beast though.

3267
01:26:47,210 --> 01:26:49,040
She's so jacked.

3268
01:26:49,070 --> 01:26:53,050
How her back is just Vandelay.

3269
01:26:53,630 --> 01:26:56,840
How did that happen with
Usada outside east son?

3270
01:26:57,050 --> 01:26:57,441
Listen,

3271
01:26:57,441 --> 01:26:58,240
it's natural.

3272
01:26:58,240 --> 01:27:00,170
How tall she,

3273
01:27:00,171 --> 01:27:00,910
Jamie controlled.

3274
01:27:00,910 --> 01:27:01,640
I don't know.

3275
01:27:01,640 --> 01:27:02,473
I don't know.

3276
01:27:03,540 --> 01:27:04,373
She's three.

3277
01:27:04,580 --> 01:27:05,413
She might be lying.

3278
01:27:05,480 --> 01:27:09,410
[inaudible] Day and age where anybody
that has muscle has to be deucing.

3279
01:27:09,560 --> 01:27:09,981
Yes,

3280
01:27:09,981 --> 01:27:10,814
it is a,

3281
01:27:10,990 --> 01:27:14,350
there are weird to me when I see
girls that are built like dudes,

3282
01:27:15,620 --> 01:27:18,190
dudes that are built are girls dudes,

3283
01:27:18,600 --> 01:27:22,460
chicks that are built like
dudes are not on the juice.

3284
01:27:22,820 --> 01:27:25,370
Then who the fuck is show
me the ones that are,

3285
01:27:25,390 --> 01:27:28,940
well damn they must be weighed but hold
on though because there's levels of

3286
01:27:28,941 --> 01:27:31,250
testosterone naturally and some people,

3287
01:27:31,450 --> 01:27:31,880
yeah,

3288
01:27:31,880 --> 01:27:35,630
but there are some girls that are just
naturally jacked and once you think most

3289
01:27:35,631 --> 01:27:37,460
girls that sign up for
finally you're going to be,

3290
01:27:37,940 --> 01:27:41,700
they tend to have more testosterone
ditch naturally I would assume.

3291
01:27:41,870 --> 01:27:45,680
Maybe taking fight or loads.

3292
01:27:46,840 --> 01:27:50,240
If you go down that road you're using
knocking when fucking Miss America and

3293
01:27:50,241 --> 01:27:52,550
like your page vantage from
having sex with fighters.

3294
01:27:52,790 --> 01:27:54,650
The hot loads coming in there.

3295
01:27:54,680 --> 01:27:55,390
Those,

3296
01:27:55,390 --> 01:28:00,240
you know there might be some geology POC
you're on to some crazy shit be coming

3297
01:28:00,241 --> 01:28:01,100
in wanting to be fighters.

3298
01:28:01,100 --> 01:28:03,980
Then I had to the gym all the
time hanging out exactly like,

3299
01:28:04,010 --> 01:28:04,251
oh,

3300
01:28:04,251 --> 01:28:07,000
I've been here for three
years and I think it's mad

3301
01:28:09,050 --> 01:28:09,800
money to,

3302
01:28:09,800 --> 01:28:12,830
they've shown about women is that
women when they are forced to be the

3303
01:28:12,831 --> 01:28:13,640
breadwinner,

3304
01:28:13,640 --> 01:28:16,490
when women like when they become single
or are they have to take care of their

3305
01:28:16,491 --> 01:28:16,701
kids,

3306
01:28:16,701 --> 01:28:17,240
they have to work.

3307
01:28:17,240 --> 01:28:18,590
Their testosterone ramps up.

3308
01:28:19,370 --> 01:28:21,290
It actually changes open.

3309
01:28:21,291 --> 01:28:23,270
They're forced into a
position where they have to,

3310
01:28:23,330 --> 01:28:23,900
you know,

3311
01:28:23,900 --> 01:28:25,670
earn their money out there.

3312
01:28:25,671 --> 01:28:26,870
In the competitive world,

3313
01:28:26,871 --> 01:28:28,640
they actually develop more testosterone.

3314
01:28:29,180 --> 01:28:32,900
Don't ask me where I ask me to
cite my sources because he's short.

3315
01:28:33,020 --> 01:28:33,853

3316
01:28:35,170 --> 01:28:35,930
cause she's short.

3317
01:28:35,930 --> 01:28:37,760
She's jacked and there's
no doubt about it.

3318
01:28:37,761 --> 01:28:37,980
She just,

3319
01:28:37,980 --> 01:28:38,220

she has no days doing curls.

3323
01:28:43,310 --> 01:28:43,890
Zero.

3324
01:28:43,890 --> 01:28:44,570
She's a tank.

3325
01:28:44,570 --> 01:28:45,403
She just got,

3326
01:28:45,720 --> 01:28:46,800
she has a new foot too.

3327
01:28:47,230 --> 01:28:47,420
Yeah,

3328
01:28:47,420 --> 01:28:48,253

3329
01:28:48,290 --> 01:28:49,100
Did they announced that?

3330
01:28:49,100 --> 01:28:49,341
Yeah,

3331
01:28:49,341 --> 01:28:49,671

3332
01:28:49,671 --> 01:28:50,360
I forget who.

3333
01:28:50,360 --> 01:28:51,193
Who is she fighting?

3334
01:28:51,480 --> 01:28:52,313
I forget.

3335
01:28:52,870 --> 01:28:53,261
Yeah,

3336
01:28:53,261 --> 01:28:53,810
I don't care.

3337
01:28:53,810 --> 01:28:54,643
Hey,

3338
01:28:55,420 --> 01:28:56,420

3339
01:28:56,421 --> 01:28:57,254

3347
01:29:06,541 --> 01:29:08,970
But I think timing wise,

3348
01:29:08,971 --> 01:29:11,460
I think that a Rico's
going to beat him probably.

3349
01:29:11,490 --> 01:29:11,971
I liked it.

3350
01:29:11,971 --> 01:29:12,271

3432
01:30:48,620 --> 01:30:50,700

Fuck it,

3435
01:30:55,340 --> 01:30:56,340
I'm adopted brother.

3436
01:30:56,341 --> 01:30:58,260
They don't know about if some dude,

3437
01:31:00,720 --> 01:31:04,950
if some dude comes in and tries to do
Bruce Buffer while Bruce buffer is gone,

3438
01:31:05,010 --> 01:31:06,720
he will be booed out of the fucking arena.

3439
01:31:06,830 --> 01:31:07,890
So he's going to surprise.

3440
01:31:07,900 --> 01:31:09,060
He's going to have to do his own shit.

3441
01:31:09,090 --> 01:31:10,050
I think you'd be surprised.

3442
01:31:10,190 --> 01:31:10,660
Cause range.

3443
01:31:10,660 --> 01:31:12,420
Then there's Bruce buffer
that was Michael Bumper.

3444
01:31:12,421 --> 01:31:13,380
So uh,

3445
01:31:13,480 --> 01:31:17,520
let's get ready to run ball right
and he doesn't do this time.

3446
01:31:17,670 --> 01:31:20,910
Then you get some new dude in
there who just fucking remix is it?

3447
01:31:21,090 --> 01:31:21,271
Yeah,

3448
01:31:21,271 --> 01:31:23,730
but that's not going to happen because
we would know who that got some black

3449
01:31:23,731 --> 01:31:24,060
dude.

3450
01:31:24,060 --> 01:31:24,930
He would already be comes in.

3451
01:31:24,931 --> 01:31:25,780
It's the bison.

3452
01:31:25,830 --> 01:31:27,000
It's a black dude for sure.

3453
01:31:27,020 --> 01:31:30,180
He boxing is the question mark
in the Midwest disagrees buffer.

3454
01:31:30,450 --> 01:31:31,021
Nobody.

3455
01:31:31,021 --> 01:31:31,854
Nobody.

3456
01:31:32,310 --> 01:31:32,700
Oh,

3457
01:31:32,700 --> 01:31:33,540
I'm not saying they are.

3458
01:31:33,570 --> 01:31:35,730
They're going to do their
own shit and flip the script.

3459
01:31:36,610 --> 01:31:36,960
Uh,

3460
01:31:36,960 --> 01:31:38,640
that's what Bruce is
worried about right now.

3461
01:31:38,641 --> 01:31:39,570
You're fucking with him

3462
01:31:42,310 --> 01:31:43,300
taking a day off now.

3463
01:31:43,960 --> 01:31:44,450
Crazy.

3464
01:31:44,450 --> 01:31:46,860
If some young kids not
just thinking about it.

3465
01:31:46,950 --> 01:31:47,970
These guys are going off here.

3466
01:31:47,971 --> 01:31:49,110
We're talking shit and I haven't done,

3467
01:31:49,111 --> 01:31:50,610
I'm just letting a beautiful combination.

3468
01:31:52,470 --> 01:31:54,270
It's hard not to root friend Evan Dunham.

3469
01:31:54,271 --> 01:31:55,320
He's been doing it for so long.

3470
01:31:55,660 --> 01:31:56,160
He has,

3471
01:31:56,160 --> 01:31:56,660
man.

3472
01:31:56,660 --> 01:31:57,720
It's a tough fucking game.

3473
01:31:57,750 --> 01:31:57,960
Ooh,

3474
01:31:57,960 --> 01:31:58,793
beautiful shot.

3475
01:31:59,150 --> 01:32:01,180
You're very good timing.

3476
01:32:02,220 --> 01:32:02,940
Okay.

3477
01:32:02,940 --> 01:32:04,350
I don't know anything about his opponent.

3478
01:32:04,380 --> 01:32:09,290
Is he still training out of a Vegas
usable if he's like extreme couture flow a

3479
01:32:09,291 --> 01:32:09,841
long time,

3480
01:32:09,841 --> 01:32:10,021
right?

3481
01:32:10,021 --> 01:32:10,854
It was with Ray.

3482
01:32:14,500 --> 01:32:15,010
I don't know.

3483
01:32:15,010 --> 01:32:15,870
I don't know where he's at now.

3484
01:32:16,090 --> 01:32:17,110
He's got a training goal now.

3485
01:32:17,130 --> 01:32:20,930
Did Ray stop training guys once he
signed up to the world series of fighting

3486
01:32:20,940 --> 01:32:21,430
thing?

3487
01:32:21,430 --> 01:32:24,880
Now he was there the other
day with Brad to Brad to vars.

3488
01:32:24,881 --> 01:32:26,470
Who's up in one of his students forever.

3489
01:32:26,471 --> 01:32:27,040
Wow.

3490
01:32:27,040 --> 01:32:28,270
Brad look real good man.

3491
01:32:28,450 --> 01:32:29,200
Real Sharp,

3492
01:32:29,200 --> 01:32:31,540
sharp winning streak and
then fell off a little bit,

3493
01:32:31,541 --> 01:32:32,231
but he's back now.

3494
01:32:32,231 --> 01:32:32,530
Right?

3495
01:32:32,530 --> 01:32:34,360
Well he find Yoel Romero son.

3496
01:32:34,390 --> 01:32:35,223
That'll do it.

3497
01:32:35,470 --> 01:32:35,730
Yeah.

3498
01:32:35,730 --> 01:32:37,030
To fuck your whole schedule up.

3499
01:32:37,060 --> 01:32:37,860
That'll make you better.

3500
01:32:37,860 --> 01:32:38,860
Fuck your life up.

3501
01:32:39,010 --> 01:32:41,170
Like there's some people
that can just move different.

3502
01:32:41,490 --> 01:32:44,260
We're built their front
and you're a lot older,

3503
01:32:44,320 --> 01:32:45,153
sir.

3504
01:32:45,640 --> 01:32:46,630
He's freak

3505
01:32:48,450 --> 01:32:52,660
Weidman and then [inaudible]
neck tie right there to go home.

3506
01:32:57,010 --> 01:32:58,180
You see how he freed his leg?

3507
01:32:58,750 --> 01:33:00,470
That's what it was all about right there.

3508
01:33:00,471 --> 01:33:00,820
Yeah.

3509
01:33:00,820 --> 01:33:03,340
Getting that leg free
and he pulled it off.

3510
01:33:03,341 --> 01:33:04,680
That was one of the first deep,

3511
01:33:04,900 --> 01:33:07,990
deep shit that was on a first
Japanese neckties ever in the UFC.

3512
01:33:08,250 --> 01:33:09,280
It was perfect.

3513
01:33:09,610 --> 01:33:11,110
That's what I meant by tournament Joe.

3514
01:33:11,111 --> 01:33:11,651
You know what I'm saying?

3515
01:33:11,651 --> 01:33:13,120
Like real tournament,

3516
01:33:13,330 --> 01:33:14,040
you know what I'm saying?

3517
01:33:14,040 --> 01:33:15,610
I told Joe Joe squared,

3518
01:33:15,880 --> 01:33:16,440
you know what I'm saying?

3519
01:33:16,440 --> 01:33:16,720
Yeah,

3520
01:33:16,720 --> 01:33:17,740
I totally real tournament.

3521
01:33:17,741 --> 01:33:18,640
But in my mind I was like,

3522
01:33:18,670 --> 01:33:23,320
we got our shelves with Metal Weight
turn him well Jack Array versus Rockhold

3523
01:33:23,321 --> 01:33:24,490
too is very interesting.

3524
01:33:24,650 --> 01:33:25,310
Actually.

3525
01:33:25,310 --> 01:33:27,160
Chris looks at me getting
all that model pussy.

3526
01:33:27,161 --> 01:33:28,830
He might be exhausted their Egan,

3527
01:33:28,860 --> 01:33:30,130
that Demi Lovato,

3528
01:33:30,280 --> 01:33:31,420
New York model.

3529
01:33:31,421 --> 01:33:33,550
That shit will fuck your life up son,

3530
01:33:33,780 --> 01:33:34,330
you know,

3531
01:33:34,330 --> 01:33:37,030
or take your take your next level.

3532
01:33:37,300 --> 01:33:39,320
I just am shocked that uh,

3533
01:33:39,820 --> 01:33:42,460
that he's not fighting Weidman again.

3534
01:33:42,910 --> 01:33:44,680
I felt like that would
be the fight to make.

3535
01:33:44,920 --> 01:33:49,920
Like the fight to make would be Weidman
versus Rockhold to not jocker rave what

3536
01:33:50,200 --> 01:33:51,030
you do with joc.

3537
01:33:51,030 --> 01:33:51,863
Romiro there

3538
01:33:51,920 --> 01:33:53,330
one more time.

3539
01:33:53,331 --> 01:33:54,810
We had a little problem with the dry,

3540
01:33:58,550 --> 01:33:59,510
let's see what happens.

3541
01:34:02,310 --> 01:34:03,480
Let's run this shit back.

3542
01:34:03,660 --> 01:34:04,920
He'd both gotta be clean.

3543
01:34:05,220 --> 01:34:06,500
So likewise members room.

3544
01:34:06,520 --> 01:34:07,430
So Weidman the,

3545
01:34:07,740 --> 01:34:08,101
I see,

3546
01:34:08,101 --> 01:34:11,160
I was under the impression that Shakuri
won that fight for some strange reason,

3547
01:34:11,161 --> 01:34:12,620
but I guess who wide,

3548
01:34:12,720 --> 01:34:14,700
I guess y'all were marijuana decision.

3549
01:34:14,701 --> 01:34:18,570
But then it turned out that he tested
positive for some peptide or something

3550
01:34:18,571 --> 01:34:18,961
like that.

3551
01:34:18,961 --> 01:34:20,850
And then they found the
supplement that he said he took.

3552
01:34:20,851 --> 01:34:21,630
They tested it.

3553
01:34:21,630 --> 01:34:22,470
It was positive.

3554
01:34:22,770 --> 01:34:24,180
So he gets a shorter break.

3555
01:34:24,450 --> 01:34:26,090
Check this out man there.

3556
01:34:26,100 --> 01:34:27,030
Plenty of time left.

3557
01:34:27,031 --> 01:34:27,930
And he's on his back.

3558
01:34:28,730 --> 01:34:30,060
We still have a finisher.

3559
01:34:30,120 --> 01:34:32,070
We still don't have any info on John.

3560
01:34:32,071 --> 01:34:32,490
Right?

3561
01:34:32,490 --> 01:34:35,700
So this is a spot where Kenny Robertson
caught that knee bar is right here.

3562
01:34:36,070 --> 01:34:36,930
He very similar.

3563
01:34:36,931 --> 01:34:37,410
Yes,

3564
01:34:37,410 --> 01:34:37,980
right here.

3565
01:34:37,980 --> 01:34:39,360
And you do it with the head as well,

3566
01:34:39,361 --> 01:34:39,601
right?

3567
01:34:39,601 --> 01:34:41,760
So the guy can't lean back
to be honest with you.

3568
01:34:42,380 --> 01:34:46,340
Oh you got the church should
be talking about digit two.

3569
01:34:46,350 --> 01:34:47,183
There you go.

3570
01:34:47,310 --> 01:34:47,970
Boom.

3571
01:34:47,970 --> 01:34:48,803
Oh Man.

3572
01:34:49,230 --> 01:34:50,063
Oh he is.

3573
01:34:51,530 --> 01:34:52,111
Oh it's over.

3574
01:34:52,111 --> 01:34:54,060
So go ahead and just touch it.

3575
01:34:54,900 --> 01:34:55,733
Touch it.

3576
01:34:55,750 --> 01:34:56,860
Going to gut it out.

3577
01:34:56,861 --> 01:34:57,694
All these cards,

3578
01:34:57,890 --> 01:34:58,320
Tyler

3579
01:34:58,320 --> 01:35:00,140
tion it's all time.

3580
01:35:00,950 --> 01:35:01,521
Go to sleep.

3581
01:35:01,521 --> 01:35:02,354
Sweet prints.

3582
01:35:03,250 --> 01:35:04,083
Oh,

3583
01:35:08,810 --> 01:35:09,710
amazing.

3584
01:35:09,770 --> 01:35:10,603
Amazing,

3585
01:35:10,670 --> 01:35:11,780
brilliant defense.

3586
01:35:11,781 --> 01:35:12,591
Do you go for it again?

3587
01:35:12,591 --> 01:35:13,510
58 seconds ago.

3588
01:35:13,550 --> 01:35:15,770
100% go for it.

3589
01:35:15,830 --> 01:35:17,390
He might go for an arm bar right here.

3590
01:35:20,930 --> 01:35:21,141
Yeah,

3591
01:35:21,141 --> 01:35:22,400
I haven't done them looking good.

3592
01:35:22,401 --> 01:35:24,140
It's been fighting for ever.

3593
01:35:24,170 --> 01:35:26,140
So this is a position he's
looking for an arm bar.

3594
01:35:26,141 --> 01:35:26,480
Look at that.

3595
01:35:26,480 --> 01:35:26,811
Look at that.

3596
01:35:26,811 --> 01:35:27,180
He's ready.

3597
01:35:27,180 --> 01:35:27,990
Yeah.

3598
01:35:27,990 --> 01:35:28,823
Look at this.

3599
01:35:29,180 --> 01:35:30,013
Shifted the hips

3600
01:35:32,750 --> 01:35:33,583
right back to this.

3601
01:35:34,040 --> 01:35:34,873
Wow.

3602
01:35:35,120 --> 01:35:35,241
Yeah.

3603
01:35:35,241 --> 01:35:37,210
He's attacking 30 seconds.

3604
01:35:37,230 --> 01:35:38,240
That much time left.

3605
01:35:41,770 --> 01:35:44,620
It's so rare that you see someone hit
that arm bar from the back when they're

3606
01:35:44,621 --> 01:35:47,770
going for the choke or even can take him
to the truck and hit him with the calf

3607
01:35:47,771 --> 01:35:49,440
slicer or a twister.

3608
01:35:49,460 --> 01:35:50,080
It's right.

3609
01:35:50,080 --> 01:35:50,913
I'm just going to try.

3610
01:35:51,150 --> 01:35:51,983
I

3611
01:35:53,280 --> 01:35:54,010
lost it.

3612
01:35:54,010 --> 01:35:54,491
Oh,

3613
01:35:54,491 --> 01:35:56,050
she didn't get the hips up in time.

3614
01:35:56,200 --> 01:35:59,010
She had a pillow out of Greece
going on in a Gracie style.

3615
01:35:59,570 --> 01:36:00,160
Oh,

3616
01:36:00,160 --> 01:36:00,993
one more time.

3617
01:36:01,150 --> 01:36:01,871
Flatten them out.

3618
01:36:01,871 --> 01:36:02,704
Poundage.

3619
01:36:02,950 --> 01:36:03,910
Go for poundage.

3620
01:36:04,240 --> 01:36:04,451
Oh,

3621
01:36:04,451 --> 01:36:05,290
we got half guard.

3622
01:36:06,610 --> 01:36:07,181
How about fuck.

3623
01:36:07,181 --> 01:36:08,014
Oh

3624
01:36:09,150 --> 01:36:09,983
God,

3625
01:36:10,180 --> 01:36:10,391
Dude.

3626
01:36:10,391 --> 01:36:12,520
How about steep based on over Overeem,

3627
01:36:12,840 --> 01:36:13,480
dude.

3628
01:36:13,480 --> 01:36:15,280
Overeating this whole time.

3629
01:36:15,281 --> 01:36:17,850
Like how fucking hard did he
hit him with those three shots?

3630
01:36:17,860 --> 01:36:19,240
Shots took him perfect,

3631
01:36:19,300 --> 01:36:20,100
perfect place.

3632
01:36:20,100 --> 01:36:22,840
I was stalking them earlier and he'd get
fucking hitting the guy in the head and

3633
01:36:22,920 --> 01:36:23,920
you guys talking about the triangle.

3634
01:36:23,921 --> 01:36:24,754
I'm like,

3635
01:36:24,900 --> 01:36:28,030
fucking [inaudible] shots had
been fucking but also Overeem's.

3636
01:36:28,120 --> 01:36:28,953
Not that you know,

3637
01:36:29,190 --> 01:36:29,460
his,

3638
01:36:29,460 --> 01:36:29,731
his,

3639
01:36:29,731 --> 01:36:33,520
his mother board message board
has been hit a bunch of times.

3640
01:36:33,550 --> 01:36:34,061
Yeah,

3641
01:36:34,061 --> 01:36:36,040
well that's why after the fight I said,

3642
01:36:36,041 --> 01:36:38,950
I don't want to do interviews with
fighters after they got knocked out again.

3643
01:36:39,040 --> 01:36:40,800
I appreciate it all.

3644
01:36:41,040 --> 01:36:41,770
Appreciate that.

3645
01:36:41,770 --> 01:36:42,850
When he said that,

3646
01:36:43,120 --> 01:36:43,980
when he said that,

3647
01:36:45,040 --> 01:36:46,360
I don't fucking talk.

3648
01:36:46,540 --> 01:36:47,650
When he said the guy tapped,

3649
01:36:47,651 --> 01:36:48,220
I was like,

3650
01:36:48,220 --> 01:36:48,671
fuck.

3651
01:36:48,671 --> 01:36:49,900
Imagine if he tapped like,

3652
01:36:49,901 --> 01:36:52,270
are we going to see a
task like I had no idea.

3653
01:36:52,271 --> 01:36:52,930
You don't.

3654
01:36:52,930 --> 01:36:56,290
You don't know if you miss something
during the actual calling of a fight

3655
01:36:56,291 --> 01:36:59,410
because it's happening live and it's
so chaotic and it's right after Alister

3656
01:36:59,411 --> 01:36:59,921
dropped him,

3657
01:36:59,921 --> 01:37:01,150
then he went for the guillotine.

3658
01:37:01,310 --> 01:37:02,740
Then also they're on their feet again.

3659
01:37:02,840 --> 01:37:05,230
It happened so fast when he said it.

3660
01:37:05,231 --> 01:37:06,250
He was so adamant.

3661
01:37:06,470 --> 01:37:06,610
Yeah,

3662
01:37:06,610 --> 01:37:07,443
that's good.

3663
01:37:07,810 --> 01:37:08,260
I know.

3664
01:37:08,260 --> 01:37:09,750
What about the truck in the back though,

3665
01:37:09,820 --> 01:37:10,653
Joe?

3666
01:37:11,200 --> 01:37:12,100
Aren't they going Joe,

3667
01:37:12,101 --> 01:37:12,881
he didn't tap.

3668
01:37:12,881 --> 01:37:13,810
Do you really want to show them?

3669
01:37:13,820 --> 01:37:14,590
They don't know.

3670
01:37:14,590 --> 01:37:16,800
They don't know the fight live.

3671
01:37:16,840 --> 01:37:17,830
They watched the fight live.

3672
01:37:18,470 --> 01:37:19,570
Find a way.

3673
01:37:20,840 --> 01:37:22,270
Find out it's entertaining.

3674
01:37:22,290 --> 01:37:22,780
It was.

3675
01:37:22,780 --> 01:37:27,780
It's totally possible that if he did
tap that someone saw it in the truck,

3676
01:37:28,330 --> 01:37:29,163
they would have said it,

3677
01:37:29,440 --> 01:37:30,280
but they didn't say it.

3678
01:37:30,310 --> 01:37:30,970
But they're like,

3679
01:37:30,970 --> 01:37:31,421
we're going to,

3680
01:37:31,421 --> 01:37:32,171
we'll play it for you.

3681
01:37:32,171 --> 01:37:32,561
And I said,

3682
01:37:32,561 --> 01:37:32,810
okay,

3683
01:37:32,810 --> 01:37:33,161
we're going to,

3684
01:37:33,161 --> 01:37:33,994
we're going to play it.

3685
01:37:34,060 --> 01:37:35,560
And so they had a cute up,

3686
01:37:35,590 --> 01:37:37,800
they played it and then
he was still insistent.

3687
01:37:37,810 --> 01:37:38,021
I'm like,

3688
01:37:38,021 --> 01:37:38,201
okay,

3689
01:37:38,201 --> 01:37:39,370
well maybe it's the other hand,

3690
01:37:39,850 --> 01:37:40,571
but I was thinking,

3691
01:37:40,571 --> 01:37:40,781
man,

3692
01:37:40,781 --> 01:37:41,710
this is not look good,

3693
01:37:42,940 --> 01:37:45,040
but it has to be solved.

3694
01:37:45,280 --> 01:37:46,330
It has to be resolved.

3695
01:37:46,450 --> 01:37:49,510
You know when the guy says the guy tapped
him and handled to show champion part

3696
01:37:49,511 --> 01:37:49,961
of the game,

3697
01:37:49,961 --> 01:37:50,410
if you check it,

3698
01:37:50,410 --> 01:37:51,160
you have to show it.

3699
01:37:51,160 --> 01:37:51,390
Yeah,

3700
01:37:51,390 --> 01:37:52,690
they have to show him those.

3701
01:37:53,230 --> 01:37:55,590
But I wish we didn't interview him at all.

3702
01:37:55,650 --> 01:37:56,160
I wish,

3703
01:37:56,160 --> 01:37:56,371
you know,

3704
01:37:56,371 --> 01:37:58,050
I think you guys did have a chance to,

3705
01:37:58,051 --> 01:38:01,710
he was completely unconscious and it
took them a while to get back to his feet

3706
01:38:02,130 --> 01:38:05,730
and to have a conversation
with him about the strategy,

3707
01:38:05,790 --> 01:38:06,990
about where it went wrong.

3708
01:38:06,991 --> 01:38:08,460
And it's crazy.

3709
01:38:08,490 --> 01:38:11,960
It doesn't make any sense that

3710
01:38:13,880 --> 01:38:14,713
one more time,

3711
01:38:14,790 --> 01:38:17,440
but he doesn't have the leg
it all right there at dark.

3712
01:38:17,490 --> 01:38:22,490
This is a serious shit and got a guy
get loses and gets submitted it or

3713
01:38:22,561 --> 01:38:23,150
whatever.

3714
01:38:23,150 --> 01:38:25,500
But even in other sports or this sucks.

3715
01:38:25,501 --> 01:38:26,230
I wish I would have one.

3716
01:38:26,230 --> 01:38:26,471
Yeah,

3717
01:38:26,471 --> 01:38:29,220
he even in other sports like
the NFL for God's concussion,

3718
01:38:29,250 --> 01:38:29,520
your,

3719
01:38:29,520 --> 01:38:30,510
he's not doing interviews,

3720
01:38:30,511 --> 01:38:30,691
man.

3721
01:38:30,691 --> 01:38:31,710
He's not right in the head.

3722
01:38:31,900 --> 01:38:33,020
The guy breaks his leg,

3723
01:38:33,060 --> 01:38:33,691
ours a need.

3724
01:38:33,691 --> 01:38:37,200
They're not interviewing him because what
the fuck's again is you don't kind of

3725
01:38:37,201 --> 01:38:40,280
fucking frame a mind
that guys in dark nuts.

3726
01:38:40,800 --> 01:38:42,040
So you're 100% right Joe.

3727
01:38:42,041 --> 01:38:42,690
I love that.

3728
01:38:42,690 --> 01:38:43,380
Well,

3729
01:38:43,380 --> 01:38:43,681
you know,

3730
01:38:43,681 --> 01:38:48,681
it's something I had suggested a long
time ago back when we interviewed Mirko

3731
01:38:48,870 --> 01:38:50,760
Cro cop after Gonzaga knocked him out.

3732
01:38:51,060 --> 01:38:52,880
I was looking in his eyes that night.

3733
01:38:52,890 --> 01:38:53,723
You guys interviewed,

3734
01:38:54,860 --> 01:38:57,240
interviewed no more right after the fight.

3735
01:38:57,690 --> 01:38:58,441
And I was like,

3736
01:38:58,441 --> 01:38:59,400
we can't do that anymore.

3737
01:38:59,401 --> 01:39:01,230
And I said it to him and
we just kept dealing it.

3738
01:39:01,260 --> 01:39:02,490
What if it's good for ratings?

3739
01:39:02,520 --> 01:39:03,080
Like they do it.

3740
01:39:03,080 --> 01:39:03,841
They get knocked out.

3741
01:39:03,841 --> 01:39:04,860
Guaranteed interview.

3742
01:39:05,030 --> 01:39:06,420
You want to be good though.

3743
01:39:06,600 --> 01:39:07,433
I'm not doing anything.

3744
01:39:07,670 --> 01:39:09,150
They'll even show him
on the ground anymore.

3745
01:39:09,151 --> 01:39:10,380
They pan away on the camera.

3746
01:39:10,381 --> 01:39:12,420
They tell you a yes or no
Joe or they don't care.

3747
01:39:12,710 --> 01:39:13,620
I'm not doing anymore.

3748
01:39:14,310 --> 01:39:15,143
I'm not doing it.

3749
01:39:15,160 --> 01:39:16,650
When you guys getting shut the fuck,

3750
01:39:16,651 --> 01:39:21,480
you're going to find out if
guys get knocked the fuck out.

3751
01:39:21,540 --> 01:39:24,060
So if someone really
wants to talk to them,

3752
01:39:24,300 --> 01:39:25,260
they're going to have to talk to him.

3753
01:39:25,320 --> 01:39:25,740
I'm not,

3754
01:39:25,740 --> 01:39:27,600
I'm not talking to above was
going to jump in that bitch.

3755
01:39:27,601 --> 01:39:29,000
How do you fail?

3756
01:39:32,060 --> 01:39:33,010
Take it from here.

3757
01:39:33,090 --> 01:39:34,740
It's time for me to interview you,

3758
01:39:35,130 --> 01:39:35,491
Joe.

3759
01:39:35,491 --> 01:39:36,324
I'll take it from here.

3760
01:39:36,450 --> 01:39:37,200
Thank you sir.

3761
01:39:37,200 --> 01:39:38,220
I know you hate this part.

3762
01:39:38,730 --> 01:39:39,450
I got a raise.

3763
01:39:39,450 --> 01:39:40,860
I'm doing it out of respect for the game.

3764
01:39:43,580 --> 01:39:43,860
Yeah.

3765
01:39:43,860 --> 01:39:44,670
Um,

3766
01:39:44,670 --> 01:39:45,960
I don't think we need
to and I don't think,

3767
01:39:45,961 --> 01:39:47,470
I think the UFC agrees there.

3768
01:39:47,580 --> 01:39:48,360
It's just,

3769
01:39:48,360 --> 01:39:49,320
it's better for the sport.

3770
01:39:49,350 --> 01:39:51,090
What made Allister look bad?

3771
01:39:51,210 --> 01:39:55,500
And I think if you gave him a few
hours or even a day to talk about it,

3772
01:39:55,501 --> 01:39:57,480
he probably would realize
that that never happened.

3773
01:39:57,481 --> 01:39:57,991
And it was just,

3774
01:39:57,991 --> 01:39:59,040
his brain was scrambled.

3775
01:39:59,160 --> 01:39:59,341
Well,

3776
01:39:59,341 --> 01:40:00,780
even steepen when you're talking to me,

3777
01:40:00,781 --> 01:40:01,021
he's like,

3778
01:40:01,021 --> 01:40:01,201
hey,

3779
01:40:01,201 --> 01:40:02,011
hit me with a kick.

3780
01:40:02,011 --> 01:40:02,521
No Sir,

3781
01:40:02,521 --> 01:40:03,470
that was a boy.

3782
01:40:03,471 --> 01:40:04,820
He said the guy kicks hard.

3783
01:40:05,520 --> 01:40:06,353
Yeah,

3784
01:40:07,320 --> 01:40:09,240
he did get kicked hard
and the body and he did.

3785
01:40:09,690 --> 01:40:10,290
And uh,

3786
01:40:10,290 --> 01:40:11,970
I mean he could have been mentioning that,

3787
01:40:11,971 --> 01:40:14,070
but he probably didn't realize
what knocked him down was,

3788
01:40:14,080 --> 01:40:14,913
can cuss too.

3789
01:40:15,330 --> 01:40:16,163
Most likely.

3790
01:40:16,280 --> 01:40:16,740
Oh yeah.

3791
01:40:16,740 --> 01:40:17,480
Oh yeah,

3792
01:40:17,480 --> 01:40:18,313
sure.

3793
01:40:18,780 --> 01:40:19,620
The way he got dropped,

3794
01:40:20,280 --> 01:40:23,790
flatland drop and he got staggered
more than once a hundred stagger twice,

3795
01:40:24,060 --> 01:40:25,560
at least twice in that first round.

3796
01:40:25,590 --> 01:40:26,630
So much pressure on seaweed.

3797
01:40:26,631 --> 01:40:27,211
Hometown.

3798
01:40:27,211 --> 01:40:28,770
I was so happy for him,

3799
01:40:28,771 --> 01:40:29,220
man.

3800
01:40:29,220 --> 01:40:32,400
You ain't heard roars like the
Cleveland crowd for Steve Bay.

3801
01:40:32,520 --> 01:40:34,290
It's like Dublin for Connor.

3802
01:40:34,291 --> 01:40:34,951
It's crazy.

3803
01:40:34,951 --> 01:40:35,784
They,

3804
01:40:35,850 --> 01:40:39,090
Cleveland is maybe or Cleveland,

3805
01:40:42,420 --> 01:40:43,253
but,

3806
01:40:43,740 --> 01:40:45,180
but they love him man.

3807
01:40:45,181 --> 01:40:47,430
And Cleveland is a bad ass town.

3808
01:40:47,431 --> 01:40:50,400
Man heard that it was
experiencing like this resurgence.

3809
01:40:50,730 --> 01:40:51,930
It's a fun town.

3810
01:40:51,931 --> 01:40:53,010
Those people were fun,

3811
01:40:54,230 --> 01:40:55,063
joy,

3812
01:40:55,080 --> 01:40:55,520
joy,

3813
01:40:55,520 --> 01:40:56,353
browns fan.

3814
01:40:57,180 --> 01:40:58,540
So it's terrible.

3815
01:40:59,310 --> 01:40:59,561
You know,

3816
01:40:59,561 --> 01:41:01,240
I'm not really into
football that much anymore,

3817
01:41:01,241 --> 01:41:02,530
but uh,

3818
01:41:03,100 --> 01:41:05,110
I did watch last week's Brown's game.

3819
01:41:05,111 --> 01:41:06,570
I'm so proud on Dvr.

3820
01:41:06,571 --> 01:41:07,030
I've Wah,

3821
01:41:07,030 --> 01:41:08,530
I didn't even watch their defense.

3822
01:41:08,531 --> 01:41:12,580
I just fast forward to the offense and
they played like shit and I usually you

3823
01:41:12,581 --> 01:41:16,480
feel like garbage after spending three
hours watching football by feeling your

3824
01:41:16,610 --> 01:41:18,430
team scores one touchdown,

3825
01:41:18,610 --> 01:41:18,911
you're like,

3826
01:41:18,911 --> 01:41:20,500
I fucking wasted my whole day.

3827
01:41:20,560 --> 01:41:23,830
Sat through all these fucking commercials
for this bullshit ass performance.

3828
01:41:23,920 --> 01:41:24,753
You feel like shit.

3829
01:41:24,910 --> 01:41:26,910
But when you fast forward
through it all and they realize,

3830
01:41:27,160 --> 01:41:27,341
oh,

3831
01:41:27,341 --> 01:41:28,390
I wouldn't have wasted my time.

3832
01:41:28,450 --> 01:41:29,950
I went through the whole
game in 20 minutes.

3833
01:41:30,010 --> 01:41:30,820
I felt great.

3834
01:41:30,820 --> 01:41:31,750
They look like shit.

3835
01:41:32,560 --> 01:41:33,850
That's not how you watch it.

3836
01:41:34,970 --> 01:41:39,250
So that's so fucking wrong.

3837
01:41:41,920 --> 01:41:43,060
Three hours for me,

3838
01:41:43,240 --> 01:41:45,600
if I would've just sat
through this shit is,

3839
01:41:45,660 --> 01:41:46,493
it's beautiful.

3840
01:41:46,600 --> 01:41:49,360
You didn't want to do that back in the
day because there's too many spoilers.

3841
01:41:49,361 --> 01:41:51,610
Everybody's watching TV and
there's a spoiler is everywhere,

3842
01:41:51,790 --> 01:41:52,690
but now you're like,

3843
01:41:52,691 --> 01:41:55,060
everyone's like in their own
little compartment on the Internet.

3844
01:41:55,350 --> 01:41:55,601
I'm like,

3845
01:41:55,601 --> 01:41:59,080
I never know the god damn
scores so you can DVR at game.

3846
01:41:59,081 --> 01:41:59,950
That's what I'm going to do tomorrow.

3847
01:41:59,951 --> 01:42:04,720
I'm not going to spend a kill a Sunday
watching football and wasted my time with

3848
01:42:04,721 --> 01:42:05,201
my son.

3849
01:42:05,201 --> 01:42:07,140
I forced them to watch
it at six months old.

3850
01:42:07,141 --> 01:42:09,760
It's a lot to the two in
the morning on fast forward.

3851
01:42:10,240 --> 01:42:11,080
It's the greatest.

3852
01:42:11,170 --> 01:42:13,480
Well now we know that you don't,

3853
01:42:13,481 --> 01:42:13,840
you know,

3854
01:42:13,840 --> 01:42:16,140
they're gonna they might've
done or they're doing it.

3855
01:42:16,250 --> 01:42:17,380
Hello Smith tonight.

3856
01:42:17,410 --> 01:42:18,161
Yes sir.

3857
01:42:18,161 --> 01:42:18,440
It is.

3858
01:42:18,440 --> 01:42:19,630
And it's a good fucking fight.

3859
01:42:19,631 --> 01:42:20,800
If you know about the Smith family,

3860
01:42:20,830 --> 01:42:22,000
I thought for that brothers,

3861
01:42:22,240 --> 01:42:23,080
four brothers,

3862
01:42:23,410 --> 01:42:25,000
two of them are going
to be world champions.

3863
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:26,380
All four pro boxers.

3864
01:42:26,381 --> 01:42:26,981
It's nuts,

3865
01:42:26,981 --> 01:42:27,670
man.

3866
01:42:27,670 --> 01:42:30,040
That's a tough fight for Canelo to that.

3867
01:42:30,041 --> 01:42:32,390
Smith is a fucking monster he do at home.

3868
01:42:32,430 --> 01:42:33,360
Really know anything about.

3869
01:42:33,361 --> 01:42:33,761
It's tough.

3870
01:42:33,761 --> 01:42:34,690
Tough dude.

3871
01:42:34,691 --> 01:42:35,740
After that Kell Brook fight,

3872
01:42:35,741 --> 01:42:40,741
I want to see Canelo versus triple G.

3873
01:42:42,290 --> 01:42:42,310
Dude.

3874
01:42:42,310 --> 01:42:43,330
How about uh,

3875
01:42:43,420 --> 01:42:45,880
[inaudible] verse fucking
Andre Ward in November.

3876
01:42:46,130 --> 01:42:47,650
We should do a fight campaign for that.

3877
01:42:48,150 --> 01:42:53,110
I'm in from not doing so
celebrating online for that.

3878
01:42:54,020 --> 01:42:57,250
She knew was Viking Penguin
for Turkish oil rustling.

3879
01:42:57,610 --> 01:42:58,420
We should,

3880
01:42:58,420 --> 01:42:59,420
we got to find out when the,

3881
01:42:59,560 --> 01:43:02,010
when the date is like
their world championships.

3882
01:43:02,980 --> 01:43:03,813
Dedicate that.

3883
01:43:03,880 --> 01:43:04,713
Oh Dude,

3884
01:43:05,380 --> 01:43:06,820
that shit is only on Youtube.

3885
01:43:06,830 --> 01:43:08,920
You have to go there live
and bring your phone.

3886
01:43:09,160 --> 01:43:09,993
If you want

3887
01:43:11,190 --> 01:43:16,190
Callan who'd come out of Catlins mouth
crushing probably as a Turkey stacks it,

3888
01:43:17,500 --> 01:43:19,060
he's probably done it before and shit,

3889
01:43:19,540 --> 01:43:20,373
we should,

3890
01:43:20,470 --> 01:43:22,030
they got to have world championships.

3891
01:43:22,031 --> 01:43:24,520
There's gotta be some Hixon
of Turkish oil wrestling.

3892
01:43:26,810 --> 01:43:29,680
It's like instead of
getting drunk and gambling,

3893
01:43:29,720 --> 01:43:30,940
this guy just blows guys.

3894
01:43:32,060 --> 01:43:33,010
He sucks to me.

3895
01:43:33,011 --> 01:43:36,870
Dicks and has to take and that's
why he starts losing too many dicks.

3896
01:43:37,230 --> 01:43:38,590
So he's talking about it in interviews.

3897
01:43:38,591 --> 01:43:39,730
How he cut the dick out.

3898
01:43:40,210 --> 01:43:40,511
He's like,

3899
01:43:40,511 --> 01:43:41,240
no more decks.

3900
01:43:41,240 --> 01:43:45,160
I haven't had any dick in training
camp and feel really good.

3901
01:43:45,340 --> 01:43:46,780
I did one big on Sunday.

3902
01:43:46,840 --> 01:43:47,860
That's a cheat day.

3903
01:43:48,100 --> 01:43:48,970
Cheat Day.

3904
01:43:53,970 --> 01:43:56,390
I'm sorry you can't wait til Sunday.

3905
01:43:56,391 --> 01:43:57,290
Just sucks Dick.

3906
01:43:57,410 --> 01:44:00,500
It's like when does Sunday
county's waiting on this fight?

3907
01:44:00,530 --> 01:44:01,710
I thought that was the third round.

3908
01:44:02,860 --> 01:44:03,070
What's,

3909
01:44:03,070 --> 01:44:04,520
how much am I paying attention?

3910
01:44:04,780 --> 01:44:05,060
This is,

3911
01:44:05,060 --> 01:44:06,980
I thought that was the third round
thought that was the end of the fight.

3912
01:44:07,040 --> 01:44:07,531
Evan don't,

3913
01:44:07,531 --> 01:44:08,364
I'm still going strong.

3914
01:44:08,750 --> 01:44:09,740
They raised their hands,

3915
01:44:09,741 --> 01:44:10,220
uh,

3916
01:44:10,220 --> 01:44:10,881
after that round,

3917
01:44:10,881 --> 01:44:11,870
like it was over and I thought,

3918
01:44:11,871 --> 01:44:12,261
damn,

3919
01:44:12,261 --> 01:44:13,094
that was quick.

3920
01:44:13,910 --> 01:44:15,020
We're not paying attention.

3921
01:44:15,080 --> 01:44:15,913
Yeah.

3922
01:44:17,400 --> 01:44:18,233
Okay.

3923
01:44:18,340 --> 01:44:21,520
That's one of the craziest thing about
kickboxing is that when you go to the

3924
01:44:21,521 --> 01:44:22,180
third round,

3925
01:44:22,180 --> 01:44:23,013
those tournaments,

3926
01:44:23,320 --> 01:44:24,400
if it's a draw,

3927
01:44:24,550 --> 01:44:26,080
they'd make you guys fight a fourth round.

3928
01:44:26,980 --> 01:44:28,750
What the fuck is that feeling like?

3929
01:44:29,040 --> 01:44:29,600
It,

3930
01:44:29,600 --> 01:44:30,433
it sucks.

3931
01:44:31,450 --> 01:44:32,081
I'm not going to lie.

3932
01:44:32,081 --> 01:44:34,240
It sucks because going into
that third round you're like,

3933
01:44:34,241 --> 01:44:35,290
fuck this is it all?

3934
01:44:35,950 --> 01:44:36,360
Fuck,

3935
01:44:36,360 --> 01:44:37,420
motherfucker had to do this.

3936
01:44:37,421 --> 01:44:38,290
And then you're like,

3937
01:44:38,830 --> 01:44:40,170
you go back into your coach and like,

3938
01:44:40,171 --> 01:44:41,590
I think it's going to be the
next you're out and you're like,

3939
01:44:41,620 --> 01:44:42,381
fuck no,

3940
01:44:42,381 --> 01:44:43,550
like that Simon fire.

3941
01:44:43,551 --> 01:44:44,160
I remember like thinking,

3942
01:44:44,160 --> 01:44:44,950
think I don't want to,

3943
01:44:44,950 --> 01:44:45,761
I don't fucking one,

3944
01:44:45,761 --> 01:44:45,961
two.

3945
01:44:45,961 --> 01:44:48,610
And then we had to go another round and
then ended up working out great for me,

3946
01:44:48,611 --> 01:44:49,900
but I was not happy about it.

3947
01:44:50,080 --> 01:44:50,800
You guys should,

3948
01:44:50,800 --> 01:44:52,840
if you guys both agree to
flip a coin at the end,

3949
01:44:52,841 --> 01:44:53,051
it's like,

3950
01:44:53,051 --> 01:44:53,884
do you want to fight?

3951
01:44:54,190 --> 01:44:54,800
Do you want to find,

3952
01:44:54,800 --> 01:44:55,001
okay,

3953
01:44:55,001 --> 01:44:55,580
let's just flip it.

3954
01:44:55,580 --> 01:44:57,100
I'm sure he felt the same way too.

3955
01:44:57,101 --> 01:44:57,910
He didn't want to go.

3956
01:44:57,910 --> 01:44:58,810
He didn't want to do it either.

3957
01:44:58,840 --> 01:44:58,961
Well,

3958
01:44:58,961 --> 01:45:00,760
he kept spit his mouthpiece out.

3959
01:45:00,840 --> 01:45:03,070
I think his nose was shattered at broken,

3960
01:45:03,071 --> 01:45:05,530
so he couldn't close his mouth
because he couldn't breathe

3961
01:45:07,140 --> 01:45:07,901
and shit and you're like,

3962
01:45:07,901 --> 01:45:08,190
fuck,

3963
01:45:08,190 --> 01:45:08,800
can't breathe.

3964
01:45:08,800 --> 01:45:09,633
And then his mouthpiece,

3965
01:45:09,790 --> 01:45:10,623
Kevin coming out.

3966
01:45:11,800 --> 01:45:12,011
Hey,

3967
01:45:12,011 --> 01:45:15,280
so which happens a lot actually when you
see guys in their noses like bleeding

3968
01:45:15,281 --> 01:45:15,950
like crazy.

3969
01:45:15,950 --> 01:45:18,310
It's usually when you'll
see the mouthpiece start
falling out because he just

3970
01:45:18,311 --> 01:45:19,144
can't breathe.

3971
01:45:19,840 --> 01:45:20,261
Brendon,

3972
01:45:20,261 --> 01:45:21,340
I've got a question for you real quick.

3973
01:45:21,440 --> 01:45:22,241
We'll hop on real quick.

3974
01:45:22,241 --> 01:45:23,310
Our boy Kellen,

3975
01:45:23,320 --> 01:45:26,320
he's doing shows in New York and there's
an explosion half a mile from him,

3976
01:45:26,321 --> 01:45:27,510
so show got canceled.

3977
01:45:27,530 --> 01:45:27,760
Why?

3978
01:45:27,760 --> 01:45:28,120
It's,

3979
01:45:28,120 --> 01:45:28,450
yeah,

3980
01:45:28,450 --> 01:45:29,140
he just texted me.

3981
01:45:29,140 --> 01:45:29,351
He's like,

3982
01:45:29,351 --> 01:45:29,560
Hey,

3983
01:45:29,560 --> 01:45:30,130
explode.

3984
01:45:30,130 --> 01:45:30,551
Hey brother.

3985
01:45:30,551 --> 01:45:31,660
I'm sure you saw the news.

3986
01:45:31,660 --> 01:45:33,820
My show got canceled because
there's an explosion in New York.

3987
01:45:34,720 --> 01:45:35,553
What's he talking about?

3988
01:45:35,780 --> 01:45:36,613
Terrorists.

3989
01:45:37,260 --> 01:45:37,690
Hillary.

3990
01:45:37,690 --> 01:45:38,321
False flags,

3991
01:45:38,321 --> 01:45:38,501
right?

3992
01:45:38,501 --> 01:45:39,101
Think of a deal,

3993
01:45:39,101 --> 01:45:39,370
quote,

3994
01:45:39,370 --> 01:45:40,203
quote unquote.

3995
01:45:40,490 --> 01:45:43,150
Now their body double
20 I'll let them talk.

3996
01:45:43,151 --> 01:45:43,491
29,

3997
01:45:43,491 --> 01:45:44,370
she died on the 11th.

3998
01:45:44,470 --> 01:45:44,730
Tony,

3999
01:45:44,730 --> 01:45:46,000
I'll talk like 25,

4000
01:45:46,001 --> 01:45:47,110
26 people who've been injured.

4001
01:45:47,111 --> 01:45:47,830
No deaths.

4002
01:45:47,830 --> 01:45:49,180
There's a second device.

4003
01:45:49,210 --> 01:45:50,950
They don't not to explosion
that call in a bomb.

4004
01:45:50,951 --> 01:45:51,940
You're not saying terrorism?

4005
01:45:51,941 --> 01:45:53,410
Nothing crazy like that right now.

4006
01:45:53,560 --> 01:45:54,041
Oh come on.

4007
01:45:54,041 --> 01:45:56,480
But the talent shows canceled the caddies.

4008
01:45:56,500 --> 01:45:58,510
Callen was that he said a half a block.

4009
01:45:58,600 --> 01:45:59,350
Half a block.

4010
01:45:59,350 --> 01:46:01,090
He says half black or half a mile in one.

4011
01:46:01,091 --> 01:46:01,601
So I don't know,

4012
01:46:01,601 --> 01:46:03,550
but he said it shows
cancel and it was nuts.

4013
01:46:03,551 --> 01:46:03,851
Alex.

4014
01:46:03,851 --> 01:46:04,181
Jenny's.

4015
01:46:04,181 --> 01:46:04,571
Okay.

4016
01:46:04,571 --> 01:46:06,040
Cause there's going to
be a false flag event.

4017
01:46:06,041 --> 01:46:07,420
Watch Hilary's on her,

4018
01:46:07,421 --> 01:46:08,020
uh,

4019
01:46:08,020 --> 01:46:08,390
on,

4020
01:46:08,390 --> 01:46:09,010
uh,

4021
01:46:09,010 --> 01:46:09,843
apparently,

4022
01:46:10,270 --> 01:46:11,103
uh,

4023
01:46:11,710 --> 01:46:13,060
she's not looking to Gut Hillary.

4024
01:46:13,090 --> 01:46:14,170
She's super sick.

4025
01:46:14,171 --> 01:46:15,070
That's what people are saying.

4026
01:46:15,160 --> 01:46:16,930
Well like a September 11th,

4027
01:46:16,931 --> 01:46:19,600
she left the event early
and like passed out,

4028
01:46:19,601 --> 01:46:21,670
like collapsed and fainted.

4029
01:46:21,980 --> 01:46:25,460
Cops got like a fucking shit
bag in her and Manhattan.

4030
01:46:26,110 --> 01:46:30,460
Alex Jones had some position on and he
said he shot at showing signs of some

4031
01:46:30,461 --> 01:46:31,470
kind of brain tumor.

4032
01:46:31,830 --> 01:46:36,680
But Alex Jones is so far like he used to
come across like he had like good ship

4033
01:46:36,681 --> 01:46:37,570
and he's just kinda crazy.

4034
01:46:37,571 --> 01:46:41,230
And now he's like so far the other way
that I just can't take him seriously.

4035
01:46:41,231 --> 01:46:42,820
Like even if this shit is true,

4036
01:46:42,821 --> 01:46:43,420
like he just,

4037
01:46:43,420 --> 01:46:44,170
he's like,

4038
01:46:44,170 --> 01:46:44,650
oh,

4039
01:46:44,650 --> 01:46:46,770
the globalists,

4040
01:46:46,810 --> 01:46:47,643
the elite.

4041
01:46:48,040 --> 01:46:49,390
I'm not giving you my God mother.

4042
01:46:49,430 --> 01:46:49,550
Oh,

4043
01:46:49,550 --> 01:46:49,980
you just get

4044
01:46:49,980 --> 01:46:51,480
so far as the explosion.

4045
01:46:51,481 --> 01:46:52,201
Was it terrorism?

4046
01:46:52,201 --> 01:46:53,310
But it was done intentionally.

4047
01:46:53,311 --> 01:46:55,110
So that means someone
from here would do it,

4048
01:46:55,620 --> 01:46:56,401
but isn't terrorism,

4049
01:46:56,401 --> 01:46:57,060
terrorism?

4050
01:46:57,060 --> 01:46:58,830
Maybe someone just wanted to
get rid of their building,

4051
01:46:59,910 --> 01:47:00,870
got a shitty building.

4052
01:47:01,120 --> 01:47:02,060
He was calling you.

4053
01:47:02,100 --> 01:47:04,920
I ain't got a calendar with
all this Hillary shit going on.

4054
01:47:04,921 --> 01:47:05,471
They're panicking.

4055
01:47:05,471 --> 01:47:08,700
They don't know if they're gonna stick
Bernie Sanders in or they going to put

4056
01:47:08,701 --> 01:47:09,540
Biden in.

4057
01:47:09,570 --> 01:47:10,300
How can they do this?

4058
01:47:10,300 --> 01:47:11,250
Spend the election,

4059
01:47:11,330 --> 01:47:12,660
keep Obama and longer.

4060
01:47:12,750 --> 01:47:14,850
They're about to make a
big ass decision right now.

4061
01:47:14,940 --> 01:47:16,290
Hillary apparently is.

4062
01:47:16,440 --> 01:47:17,370
You're so excited.

4063
01:47:17,730 --> 01:47:18,563
I'm just happy.

4064
01:47:18,970 --> 01:47:23,490
[inaudible] said that
explosion next door is a cold.

4065
01:47:24,130 --> 01:47:24,511
I don't know.

4066
01:47:24,511 --> 01:47:25,110
Shit.

4067
01:47:25,110 --> 01:47:25,943
That's just what I hear it.

4068
01:47:25,950 --> 01:47:28,830
I who knows the Collins like
this can all be a trick.

4069
01:47:30,090 --> 01:47:30,570
Well,

4070
01:47:30,570 --> 01:47:31,403
I mean,

4071
01:47:31,620 --> 01:47:35,750
whenever you're dealing with someone
like a Hillary Clinton and you know,

4072
01:47:35,760 --> 01:47:38,610
she's super sick and you know,

4073
01:47:38,611 --> 01:47:41,250
you leading up to the election
and she just doesn't look healthy.

4074
01:47:41,251 --> 01:47:42,420
She's fainting and stuff.

4075
01:47:42,810 --> 01:47:44,180
Now she's old band.

4076
01:47:44,181 --> 01:47:48,660
She's old and she's a poor health and
she had a serious concussion a few years

4077
01:47:48,660 --> 01:47:48,680
back,

4078
01:47:48,680 --> 01:47:49,230
cushion,

4079
01:47:49,230 --> 01:47:50,063
real batch.

4080
01:47:50,190 --> 01:47:51,023
She fainted,

4081
01:47:51,220 --> 01:47:52,740
fell down and hit her head.

4082
01:47:52,741 --> 01:47:53,101
Have you seen,

4083
01:47:53,101 --> 01:47:55,620
apparently had a brain
aneurysm and you know,

4084
01:47:55,621 --> 01:47:57,000
it was bleeding internally.

4085
01:47:57,760 --> 01:47:58,510
That's how,

4086
01:47:58,510 --> 01:47:59,343
uh,

4087
01:47:59,500 --> 01:48:01,240
I'm not saying had anything to do with,

4088
01:48:01,270 --> 01:48:01,660
uh,

4089
01:48:01,660 --> 01:48:03,310
like Parkinson's or,

4090
01:48:03,340 --> 01:48:04,173
or these,

4091
01:48:04,300 --> 01:48:05,800
these fainting spells that she has.

4092
01:48:05,801 --> 01:48:09,250
Usually when you have this disease
with fire or whatever it is,

4093
01:48:09,460 --> 01:48:10,900
they usually die from the falls.

4094
01:48:11,200 --> 01:48:13,810
They usually die and they just cracked
her head on the subject and that's what

4095
01:48:13,811 --> 01:48:14,644
they die from.

4096
01:48:14,740 --> 01:48:15,880
And uh,

4097
01:48:16,060 --> 01:48:17,350
Alex Jones had,

4098
01:48:17,620 --> 01:48:17,951
you know,

4099
01:48:17,951 --> 01:48:21,180
he's saying according to
his of physicians that,

4100
01:48:21,220 --> 01:48:21,460
that,

4101
01:48:21,460 --> 01:48:24,500
and he's saying that he's got a
connection in the secret services size.

4102
01:48:24,520 --> 01:48:26,530
So she fucking scrap.

4103
01:48:26,560 --> 01:48:27,670
We're watching the crazy,

4104
01:48:27,810 --> 01:48:32,810
we're just talking shit about Hillary
Clinton the first of the fuck killer of

4105
01:48:33,140 --> 01:48:33,973
the world here.

4106
01:48:33,990 --> 01:48:34,781
That's what we're talking about.

4107
01:48:34,781 --> 01:48:35,614
We're not talking about just some,

4108
01:48:36,760 --> 01:48:38,890
oh,

4109
01:48:39,460 --> 01:48:39,941
oh,

4110
01:48:39,941 --> 01:48:41,050
he's locked up,

4111
01:48:41,051 --> 01:48:41,884
son.

4112
01:48:42,070 --> 01:48:42,903
Look at,

4113
01:48:44,680 --> 01:48:44,861
oh,

4114
01:48:44,861 --> 01:48:45,310
he's a,

4115
01:48:45,310 --> 01:48:47,080
he's on Zombie mode.

4116
01:48:47,170 --> 01:48:48,003
Oh,

4117
01:48:48,330 --> 01:48:49,600
Friday kids Zombie mode.

4118
01:48:49,690 --> 01:48:50,920
Oh,

4119
01:48:51,490 --> 01:48:52,121
armbar and,

4120
01:48:52,121 --> 01:48:52,900
and then it's over.

4121
01:48:52,900 --> 01:48:53,111
Oh,

4122
01:48:53,111 --> 01:48:53,944
sick.

4123
01:48:56,370 --> 01:48:57,690
Oh Bell.

4124
01:48:57,950 --> 01:48:58,570
It's crazy.

4125
01:48:58,570 --> 01:49:00,940
God bless you in that arm bar.

4126
01:49:01,480 --> 01:49:03,010
How nice was Verdun was flying.

4127
01:49:03,011 --> 01:49:03,980
Fucking psychic.

4128
01:49:05,440 --> 01:49:07,750
Fucking loved it and kept
doing the fucking car.

4129
01:49:07,751 --> 01:49:08,380
Real clicks.

4130
01:49:08,380 --> 01:49:08,621
Guys.

4131
01:49:08,621 --> 01:49:09,790
We can't talk over each other.

4132
01:49:09,791 --> 01:49:11,110
It's horrible to listen to.

4133
01:49:11,111 --> 01:49:16,111
So let's regulate them to tell them
we got to definitely don't do that.

4134
01:49:16,270 --> 01:49:16,601
But yeah,

4135
01:49:16,601 --> 01:49:17,051
it was crazy.

4136
01:49:17,051 --> 01:49:18,160
It's case for crazy kick.

4137
01:49:18,790 --> 01:49:19,660
He's done it before,

4138
01:49:19,661 --> 01:49:21,350
but he did it when you
fought over a millwright.

4139
01:49:21,580 --> 01:49:22,650
People forget it.

4140
01:49:22,680 --> 01:49:23,021
Atlanta.

4141
01:49:23,021 --> 01:49:23,771
He did it before.

4142
01:49:23,771 --> 01:49:24,604
Yeah.

4143
01:49:25,040 --> 01:49:25,680
Yeah.

4144
01:49:25,680 --> 01:49:26,101
Really?

4145
01:49:26,101 --> 01:49:26,470
Yeah.

4146
01:49:26,470 --> 01:49:27,071
Wow.

4147
01:49:27,071 --> 01:49:29,830
That's interesting
little fact for you guys.

4148
01:49:29,831 --> 01:49:32,370
See each other before jumping
fucking sidekick characters.

4149
01:49:32,420 --> 01:49:32,820
Nuts.

4150
01:49:32,820 --> 01:49:37,390
He jump kicked fucking over him in pride
and straight out as s the Gif is so

4151
01:49:37,391 --> 01:49:37,910
good.

4152
01:49:37,910 --> 01:49:38,220
It's like,

4153
01:49:38,220 --> 01:49:39,400
it's just so fuck dude.

4154
01:49:39,401 --> 01:49:40,820
It fucking wobbled transplant.

4155
01:49:41,950 --> 01:49:42,910
Oh Shit.

4156
01:49:43,930 --> 01:49:44,763
The jaw.

4157
01:49:44,860 --> 01:49:46,120
It was a lot of wheel kicks,

4158
01:49:46,121 --> 01:49:46,301
man.

4159
01:49:46,301 --> 01:49:47,220
I like him a lot about,

4160
01:49:47,380 --> 01:49:47,771
we're doomed.

4161
01:49:47,771 --> 01:49:48,070
Said,

4162
01:49:48,070 --> 01:49:48,791
check this out,

4163
01:49:48,791 --> 01:49:50,290
flying fucking psychic.

4164
01:49:50,291 --> 01:49:51,220
Own your coach.

4165
01:49:51,280 --> 01:49:53,740
This is Sparta front kick.

4166
01:49:54,070 --> 01:49:55,510
Get Your Bullshit Jim out here.

4167
01:49:55,511 --> 01:49:56,344
Yeah.

4168
01:49:56,590 --> 01:49:57,520
That was real weird.

4169
01:49:57,521 --> 01:49:58,354
After the fight,

4170
01:49:58,600 --> 01:49:59,770
Edmund was screaming at them.

4171
01:49:59,790 --> 01:50:00,010
I'm like,

4172
01:50:00,010 --> 01:50:01,720
what do you think is going to happen here?

4173
01:50:01,750 --> 01:50:02,890
I think watching it,

4174
01:50:02,891 --> 01:50:05,950
I thought that he thought
that when he was fucking,

4175
01:50:05,980 --> 01:50:09,520
I think admin at some point thought that
Travis actually won that fight and then

4176
01:50:09,521 --> 01:50:12,520
he got robbed in the decision
which they were doing.

4177
01:50:13,600 --> 01:50:13,980
That's what I was,

4178
01:50:13,980 --> 01:50:14,240
no,

4179
01:50:14,240 --> 01:50:14,710
I think,

4180
01:50:14,710 --> 01:50:16,190
I think there's a lot of pressure on it,

4181
01:50:16,191 --> 01:50:17,730
so I'm doing this shit and was like,

4182
01:50:17,780 --> 01:50:18,910
oh shit.

4183
01:50:19,390 --> 01:50:21,550
I think there's a lot of pressure on
ed mean because you know it's like,

4184
01:50:21,551 --> 01:50:21,971
fuck man.

4185
01:50:21,971 --> 01:50:22,721
He gotta win a fight.

4186
01:50:22,721 --> 01:50:24,670
Traffic moved his whole camp there.

4187
01:50:24,880 --> 01:50:26,590
He's looked like pure Kaka.

4188
01:50:26,740 --> 01:50:28,000
There's a lot riding on this fight.

4189
01:50:28,001 --> 01:50:29,140
He just lost the cane,

4190
01:50:29,320 --> 01:50:30,520
so if you hear him in the corner,

4191
01:50:30,580 --> 01:50:31,570
there's desperation.

4192
01:50:31,570 --> 01:50:34,000
He's losing his voice and
then when that shit happens,

4193
01:50:34,001 --> 01:50:35,410
when your fighter fights like that,

4194
01:50:35,411 --> 01:50:38,560
I think he was just so furious
and he's an emotional guy,

4195
01:50:39,370 --> 01:50:42,580
but you're talking to the number when
heavyweight in the world and he's going to

4196
01:50:42,581 --> 01:50:45,230
twist your fucking face off when
you talked to him like that.

4197
01:50:45,250 --> 01:50:48,850
He's Brazilian and then in Brazil they'll
just fucking smack you for no reason

4198
01:50:49,100 --> 01:50:50,170
was a nice guy too,

4199
01:50:50,320 --> 01:50:53,500
for dooms a fucking grand human being.

4200
01:50:53,501 --> 01:50:54,730
One of the nice guys in the world.

4201
01:50:54,731 --> 01:50:57,130
You're lucky that was an over
him or someone like that.

4202
01:50:57,230 --> 01:50:57,760
Yeah,

4203
01:50:57,760 --> 01:50:59,050
it was all very weird.

4204
01:50:59,080 --> 01:51:01,420
It was very weird because I
didn't see it until afterwards.

4205
01:51:01,421 --> 01:51:05,770
I was climbing into the cage to do the
post fight interviews when he kicked him,

4206
01:51:05,980 --> 01:51:07,300
so I didn't see him kick him,

4207
01:51:07,450 --> 01:51:11,120
but all of a sudden Edmund went flying
a bunch of people in there and Hofeld

4208
01:51:11,120 --> 01:51:13,120
Cordura was trying to kick
Edmonds ass hot fucker.

4209
01:51:13,130 --> 01:51:17,140
Daryl was fucking fear and Edmond was
screaming at Hockfield Cordero and Hofeld

4210
01:51:17,140 --> 01:51:19,150
Codero was ready to throw.

4211
01:51:19,390 --> 01:51:19,661
I mean,

4212
01:51:19,661 --> 01:51:20,520
they cut all that off.

4213
01:51:20,521 --> 01:51:23,210
I was really considering
what he should or shouldn't.

4214
01:51:23,990 --> 01:51:25,870
Don't standing right back.

4215
01:51:25,871 --> 01:51:28,480
He's a bad mother fucker and Hofeld
Cordell was right in front of them

4216
01:51:28,481 --> 01:51:30,190
considering what he
should or shouldn't do.

4217
01:51:30,430 --> 01:51:32,590
And they were trying to
move Edmund away from him.

4218
01:51:32,680 --> 01:51:34,000
But he had said some nasty shit.

4219
01:51:34,001 --> 01:51:34,361
I don't know.

4220
01:51:34,361 --> 01:51:35,890
I don't know who said what or what,

4221
01:51:36,010 --> 01:51:40,470
but there was a lot of like extremities
when you see Dana didn't see any of that

4222
01:51:40,471 --> 01:51:41,291
came in and was like,

4223
01:51:41,291 --> 01:51:42,124
God,

4224
01:51:42,160 --> 01:51:42,993
come on,

4225
01:51:43,300 --> 01:51:44,830
we got cm punk before this.

4226
01:51:44,831 --> 01:51:44,981
No,

4227
01:51:44,981 --> 01:51:46,120
you got this bull shit.

4228
01:51:46,300 --> 01:51:50,200
You got a Brazilian and an Armenian
Brazilians that are mainly and have one

4229
01:51:50,201 --> 01:51:51,034
thing in common.

4230
01:51:51,220 --> 01:51:53,290
They don't take any shit on the street.

4231
01:51:53,570 --> 01:51:55,540
You get you say anything
to Armenian on the street.

4232
01:51:56,070 --> 01:51:56,620
We got fucked.

4233
01:51:56,620 --> 01:52:00,380
The Armenian Armenian.

4234
01:52:01,090 --> 01:52:01,700
Armenian.

4235
01:52:01,700 --> 01:52:02,390
Armenian.

4236
01:52:02,390 --> 01:52:02,530
Yeah,

4237
01:52:02,530 --> 01:52:07,060
but say the [inaudible] whatever.

4238
01:52:07,420 --> 01:52:11,860
Italian Albanian students that don't
say shit and throw our money in Armani's

4239
01:52:12,080 --> 01:52:12,280
Oh,

4240
01:52:12,280 --> 01:52:12,910
suit.

4241
01:52:12,910 --> 01:52:13,790
But the differences,

4242
01:52:13,810 --> 01:52:16,930
one of them is ranked number one in the
world and rip your fucking Dick off.

4243
01:52:16,931 --> 01:52:20,150
And the other guys just to get the
races are down to fight at anytime.

4244
01:52:20,290 --> 01:52:20,830
That's what I'm saying.

4245
01:52:20,830 --> 01:52:21,940
But one can fight better than the other.

4246
01:52:21,941 --> 01:52:22,970
That's where you got it all.

4247
01:52:23,070 --> 01:52:23,903
Now that's up.

4248
01:52:26,550 --> 01:52:28,140
Never heard of current European,

4249
01:52:28,180 --> 01:52:29,013
sir.

4250
01:52:29,050 --> 01:52:29,883
Are you being serious?

4251
01:52:30,070 --> 01:52:30,910
He was at one point.

4252
01:52:30,940 --> 01:52:31,151
I mean,

4253
01:52:31,151 --> 01:52:32,020
he's a fuckwit.

4254
01:52:32,260 --> 01:52:35,170
Edmund was a legit kickbox you're
backing in there compared to,

4255
01:52:35,320 --> 01:52:35,591
I mean,

4256
01:52:35,591 --> 01:52:38,320
not pretty sure he's a,

4257
01:52:38,321 --> 01:52:41,770
he's a piece of shit competitor for doom.

4258
01:52:41,960 --> 01:52:42,970
Doom so big too.

4259
01:52:42,971 --> 01:52:45,350
He's such a giant and he's top,

4260
01:52:45,440 --> 01:52:46,340
top three.

4261
01:52:46,341 --> 01:52:47,950
Best heavyweights of all time.

4262
01:52:48,010 --> 01:52:50,000
He just happens to be one of
the greatest guys in the world.

4263
01:52:50,001 --> 01:52:50,540
You know what I'm saying?

4264
01:52:50,540 --> 01:52:51,650
He's a really good dude.

4265
01:52:53,180 --> 01:52:53,440
Yeah.

4266
01:52:53,440 --> 01:52:55,310
So we showed him that he should
have kept his mouth shut.

4267
01:52:56,120 --> 01:52:56,953
Which one?

4268
01:52:57,320 --> 01:52:58,040
Edmond.

4269
01:52:58,040 --> 01:52:59,060
Who knows what was said.

4270
01:52:59,061 --> 01:53:00,180
So you can't say that and let's see.

4271
01:53:00,240 --> 01:53:01,160
You know what was said?

4272
01:53:01,370 --> 01:53:04,310
I know what you shouldn't do is approach
a fighter and try and fight him as a

4273
01:53:04,311 --> 01:53:04,671
coach.

4274
01:53:04,671 --> 01:53:06,770
We know that I don't give
a fuck what he said to you.

4275
01:53:06,800 --> 01:53:07,041
Yeah,

4276
01:53:07,041 --> 01:53:08,390
super controversial move.

4277
01:53:08,480 --> 01:53:11,360
I think that he just was
watching and they use pissed off.

4278
01:53:11,361 --> 01:53:14,360
This guy lost and then fucking
Verdomme starts doing this shit.

4279
01:53:14,361 --> 01:53:14,811
And he was like,

4280
01:53:14,811 --> 01:53:16,430
hey mother fucker don't do that shit.

4281
01:53:16,490 --> 01:53:17,600
And then Verdun was like,

4282
01:53:17,660 --> 01:53:18,493
who you talking to you?

4283
01:53:18,650 --> 01:53:20,020
Well what happened?

4284
01:53:20,680 --> 01:53:21,430
He's like,

4285
01:53:21,430 --> 01:53:22,263
don't fucking talk.

4286
01:53:22,480 --> 01:53:22,960
I said,

4287
01:53:22,960 --> 01:53:24,350
the reason why front kick and he goes,

4288
01:53:24,351 --> 01:53:26,510
cause I could tell in his eyes he
was going to throw a punch at me.

4289
01:53:26,540 --> 01:53:27,170
He said,

4290
01:53:27,170 --> 01:53:27,471
he goes,

4291
01:53:27,471 --> 01:53:28,820
I could have done something a lot worse.

4292
01:53:29,030 --> 01:53:29,570
He's right.

4293
01:53:29,570 --> 01:53:31,040
Did we don't flip off the audience.

4294
01:53:35,400 --> 01:53:36,233
They were weren't.

4295
01:53:36,440 --> 01:53:37,910
They weren't booing the fact that he won,

4296
01:53:37,911 --> 01:53:39,770
they were booing that the
fight was lack luster.

4297
01:53:39,800 --> 01:53:40,633
Correct.

4298
01:53:41,050 --> 01:53:42,050
But it was,

4299
01:53:42,140 --> 01:53:42,500
it was,

4300
01:53:42,500 --> 01:53:44,120
he wasn't blowing that like off.

4301
01:53:44,180 --> 01:53:44,751
Fuck you.

4302
01:53:44,751 --> 01:53:45,230
It was like,

4303
01:53:45,230 --> 01:53:47,840
Oh crap was right at the
top for doom was like,

4304
01:53:47,841 --> 01:53:50,090
we just fought her fucking ass off.

4305
01:53:50,300 --> 01:53:51,140
We're doing some shit.

4306
01:53:51,640 --> 01:53:53,660
They're there in the
fucking kids throwing down.

4307
01:53:53,661 --> 01:53:54,950
So no matter how it goes down,

4308
01:53:55,160 --> 01:53:57,050
the audience should never hold on.

4309
01:53:57,051 --> 01:53:58,490
You got to take this into consideration.

4310
01:53:58,491 --> 01:53:59,690
The audience is there.

4311
01:53:59,720 --> 01:54:00,680
It's in Cleveland,

4312
01:54:00,890 --> 01:54:01,341
steep,

4313
01:54:01,341 --> 01:54:03,170
a beat for doom for the belt.

4314
01:54:03,230 --> 01:54:04,820
They all know that they're
there for Steve Bay.

4315
01:54:04,821 --> 01:54:07,910
They know that for doom was the
guy Steve a beat for the belts.

4316
01:54:07,911 --> 01:54:09,020
So they're against VRE.

4317
01:54:09,021 --> 01:54:10,500
Do them anyway cause he's like the,

4318
01:54:10,730 --> 01:54:12,500
he's like the invading team.

4319
01:54:12,950 --> 01:54:13,400
I get it.

4320
01:54:13,400 --> 01:54:13,760
I get it.

4321
01:54:13,760 --> 01:54:14,130
You're right.

4322
01:54:14,130 --> 01:54:14,963
You're right.

4323
01:54:15,800 --> 01:54:16,710
It was a was,

4324
01:54:16,730 --> 01:54:17,481
it wasn't a good fight,

4325
01:54:17,481 --> 01:54:22,220
but I was amazed that Travis was able to
recover when Fabrizio got his back that

4326
01:54:22,221 --> 01:54:22,760
I was,

4327
01:54:22,760 --> 01:54:23,271
I was like,

4328
01:54:23,271 --> 01:54:23,950
wow,

4329
01:54:23,950 --> 01:54:24,740
I dude,

4330
01:54:24,740 --> 01:54:25,460
dude's got heart.

4331
01:54:25,460 --> 01:54:26,060
He's got some,

4332
01:54:26,060 --> 01:54:27,880
he's got some very good defense to cause.

4333
01:54:27,900 --> 01:54:28,671
Fabrizio had him,

4334
01:54:28,671 --> 01:54:31,880
dad had him hurt and then had them
down and then took his back and I was,

4335
01:54:31,940 --> 01:54:33,320
I was shocked that he didn't finish them.

4336
01:54:33,410 --> 01:54:33,621
I'm like,

4337
01:54:33,621 --> 01:54:34,610
that's pretty impressive.

4338
01:54:35,570 --> 01:54:37,850
Especially considering the
Travis had a broken finger.

4339
01:54:38,360 --> 01:54:39,590
His fingers fucked up.

4340
01:54:39,591 --> 01:54:40,520
You see the pictures of it?

4341
01:54:40,550 --> 01:54:40,911
I did too.

4342
01:54:40,911 --> 01:54:41,331
The pictures.

4343
01:54:41,331 --> 01:54:45,560
What's more impressive though is for
doom fighting and thrown a spinning or

4344
01:54:45,590 --> 01:54:49,100
kicks and the fucking flying
kick with a broken foot.

4345
01:54:49,101 --> 01:54:49,251
You know,

4346
01:54:49,251 --> 01:54:50,660
he went into the fight with broken foot.

4347
01:54:50,930 --> 01:54:51,763
Which foot?

4348
01:54:51,950 --> 01:54:52,783
I'm not sure.

4349
01:54:52,970 --> 01:54:53,840
That is impressive though.

4350
01:54:53,870 --> 01:54:55,910
That was impressive because
how impressive is that?

4351
01:54:55,940 --> 01:54:57,770
Wonder if it was the broken
when he kicked him with,

4352
01:54:57,940 --> 01:54:59,900
I'm sure ridiculous gangsters that,

4353
01:54:59,930 --> 01:55:02,720
well I thought that it was like a mental
warfare thing that I thought was kind

4354
01:55:02,721 --> 01:55:04,340
of awesome was that if,

4355
01:55:04,760 --> 01:55:05,930
I don't know the situation,

4356
01:55:05,931 --> 01:55:09,110
but saver doom wasn't in the best shape
and needed it to be a slower paced fight

4357
01:55:09,111 --> 01:55:12,560
and you come out and you do that flying
fucking push cake with a fractured site

4358
01:55:13,010 --> 01:55:16,430
and then all of a sudden you're doing
fucking cartwheel kicks cause you don't

4359
01:55:16,431 --> 01:55:18,510
give a fuck if he gets on top
of you and you're underground.

4360
01:55:18,650 --> 01:55:19,011
Wow.

4361
01:55:19,011 --> 01:55:21,670
And then next thing you know is a slow
paced fight and you get to win on,

4362
01:55:21,970 --> 01:55:22,630
you know I,

4363
01:55:22,630 --> 01:55:22,960
it was,

4364
01:55:22,960 --> 01:55:26,420
it was cool that that fights topman
cause both guys were in the show much

4365
01:55:26,421 --> 01:55:29,090
pressure because if we're doing loses
he goes to the back of the line.

4366
01:55:29,091 --> 01:55:32,180
He's older and this is this
fucking second time in the UFC.

4367
01:55:32,480 --> 01:55:33,290
Trash Brown.

4368
01:55:33,290 --> 01:55:35,030
He's one out of his last five.

4369
01:55:35,080 --> 01:55:37,040
He admin all this pressure.

4370
01:55:37,130 --> 01:55:37,551
So there's,

4371
01:55:37,551 --> 01:55:39,660
so there's just high tension man,

4372
01:55:40,190 --> 01:55:41,001
very high tension.

4373
01:55:41,001 --> 01:55:42,740
There was a lot going
on for of us for them.

4374
01:55:42,750 --> 01:55:44,610
Now he's like 49

4375
01:55:44,640 --> 01:55:45,120
yeah.

4376
01:55:45,120 --> 01:55:45,301
Yeah,

4377
01:55:45,301 --> 01:55:47,220
he's 39 you know,

4378
01:55:47,221 --> 01:55:52,080
it's interesting because the als to
fight like the way ouster was avoiding

4379
01:55:52,110 --> 01:55:54,120
exchanges and getting out of the way.

4380
01:55:54,450 --> 01:55:57,240
It's so like you're watching a
totally different fighter now.

4381
01:55:57,241 --> 01:55:58,530
It's so interesting.

4382
01:55:58,710 --> 01:56:02,370
Like you remember his fight with Todd
Duffy when he was the destroyer and he's

4383
01:56:02,371 --> 01:56:03,204
just

4384
01:56:04,150 --> 01:56:04,620
pants.

4385
01:56:04,620 --> 01:56:05,100
Yeah,

4386
01:56:05,100 --> 01:56:05,401
I know.

4387
01:56:05,401 --> 01:56:05,910
Exactly.

4388
01:56:05,910 --> 01:56:07,080
And then with Brock,

4389
01:56:07,081 --> 01:56:08,370
same thing pre Usada.

4390
01:56:08,800 --> 01:56:09,570
I mean that,

4391
01:56:09,570 --> 01:56:12,480
that Alister had such a different style.

4392
01:56:12,481 --> 01:56:14,880
Now he's moving around a lot.

4393
01:56:14,881 --> 01:56:16,040
He's got his hands out,

4394
01:56:16,230 --> 01:56:20,310
he's running away from exchanges and
picking his spots and trying to fight at a

4395
01:56:20,311 --> 01:56:21,630
really reserved pace.

4396
01:56:21,631 --> 01:56:25,320
He's trying to like preserve
his energy and pace himself.

4397
01:56:25,350 --> 01:56:25,890
But,

4398
01:56:25,890 --> 01:56:26,970
but what technique,

4399
01:56:26,971 --> 01:56:29,130
and I mean maybe you
would know better job.

4400
01:56:29,160 --> 01:56:33,990
What technique did they ever teach in
any martial art where you run like that?

4401
01:56:34,170 --> 01:56:34,740
I don't know.

4402
01:56:34,740 --> 01:56:36,820
I was called get the fuck
away from steep bank.

4403
01:56:37,060 --> 01:56:37,440
Right.

4404
01:56:37,440 --> 01:56:41,460
A lot of talk about it after Connor did
the tonight and other negative positive,

4405
01:56:41,461 --> 01:56:41,681
whatever.

4406
01:56:41,681 --> 01:56:43,330
We're talking about fatigue
and stuff like that.

4407
01:56:43,331 --> 01:56:46,260
And then I looked exactly like that,

4408
01:56:46,440 --> 01:56:46,711
but,

4409
01:56:46,711 --> 01:56:49,470
but Conor did it later in the
rounds when he doing the first run.

4410
01:56:49,471 --> 01:56:50,370
When you're not tired,

4411
01:56:50,580 --> 01:56:52,820
that's just that mean that's
your straight technique son.

4412
01:56:52,860 --> 01:56:52,981
Well,

4413
01:56:52,981 --> 01:56:56,130
I think if we do it on a football
field by Joe wants to have those

4414
01:56:56,190 --> 01:56:56,800
opportunities,

4415
01:56:56,800 --> 01:56:57,361
people are gonna be like,

4416
01:56:57,361 --> 01:56:57,751
Hey man,

4417
01:56:57,751 --> 01:57:00,540
this is too close to fucking
run away from the threat shop.

4418
01:57:00,570 --> 01:57:02,280
Metamorris running and
get their shit together.

4419
01:57:02,620 --> 01:57:03,240
[inaudible] field.

4420
01:57:03,240 --> 01:57:07,440
I'm out time to run or get
down some duties to down.

4421
01:57:07,530 --> 01:57:10,980
Remember when Max Holloway and Ricardo
Lamas to each other and pointed at the

4422
01:57:10,981 --> 01:57:11,401
ground,

4423
01:57:11,401 --> 01:57:12,121
so let's do this.

4424
01:57:12,121 --> 01:57:15,750
And they just swung through the
last 10 seconds of the fight.

4425
01:57:15,751 --> 01:57:16,860
Just one.

4426
01:57:17,730 --> 01:57:20,070
There's going to be guys that do that
too and there's going to be guided that

4427
01:57:20,071 --> 01:57:20,710
Alister it,

4428
01:57:20,710 --> 01:57:21,543
God bless them,

4429
01:57:22,270 --> 01:57:23,640
but I've never seen him.

4430
01:57:23,670 --> 01:57:25,230
Have you ever seen Allister like that?

4431
01:57:25,440 --> 01:57:25,770
Ever?

4432
01:57:25,770 --> 01:57:26,610
Not asked her.

4433
01:57:26,990 --> 01:57:27,823
Never seen it.

4434
01:57:28,170 --> 01:57:29,510
But you also have a straight left.

4435
01:57:29,511 --> 01:57:30,660
It drove to all of this beautiful though.

4436
01:57:30,690 --> 01:57:32,670
It was amazing and it
was off of that runaway.

4437
01:57:32,671 --> 01:57:34,050
The other thing that I
was thinking is like,

4438
01:57:35,880 --> 01:57:37,550
and even in nature when Nate and Connor,

4439
01:57:37,560 --> 01:57:38,220
when it happened,

4440
01:57:38,220 --> 01:57:39,300
when you do that,

4441
01:57:39,301 --> 01:57:40,170
like runaway thing,

4442
01:57:40,171 --> 01:57:41,280
you're getting a reset.

4443
01:57:41,370 --> 01:57:44,430
And then like for example with a Nate,

4444
01:57:44,670 --> 01:57:45,930
Nate's began kicking the leg a lot.

4445
01:57:45,931 --> 01:57:48,240
You're walking around
the the fucking ring,

4446
01:57:48,241 --> 01:57:48,901
he runs away,

4447
01:57:48,901 --> 01:57:50,280
you're walking to him walking to him.

4448
01:57:50,550 --> 01:57:52,170
He set now and he's waiting for you.

4449
01:57:52,171 --> 01:57:53,370
As soon as you come into distance,

4450
01:57:53,371 --> 01:57:54,660
like I gets like the jump on,

4451
01:57:54,770 --> 01:57:55,561
you know what I mean?

4452
01:57:55,561 --> 01:57:56,410
Which is a,

4453
01:57:57,060 --> 01:57:57,510
it's weird.

4454
01:57:57,510 --> 01:57:58,140
It's a thing.

4455
01:57:58,140 --> 01:57:58,973
Well it's a thing.

4456
01:57:58,980 --> 01:58:00,210
Well you don't have to move forward.

4457
01:58:00,620 --> 01:58:02,010
You don't have to advance right for him.

4458
01:58:02,010 --> 01:58:03,480
That'd be kind of interesting
if you just stood there.

4459
01:58:03,481 --> 01:58:03,601
I was,

4460
01:58:03,601 --> 01:58:04,440
it never went away.

4461
01:58:04,470 --> 01:58:06,450
I've never seen one
over him stealing ever.

4462
01:58:06,660 --> 01:58:07,650
Well you know what man?

4463
01:58:07,651 --> 01:58:11,190
He got tagged a couple of times and I
think he also realizes that steep bay is a

4464
01:58:11,191 --> 01:58:12,420
fucking dangerous guy.

4465
01:58:12,690 --> 01:58:14,490
And at this stage of his life,

4466
01:58:14,700 --> 01:58:16,320
he's not that good at taking a shot.

4467
01:58:16,980 --> 01:58:17,311
You know?

4468
01:58:17,311 --> 01:58:18,144
He's just not.

4469
01:58:18,510 --> 01:58:19,081
And then what?

4470
01:58:19,081 --> 01:58:22,470
What scenario would have been better
for him to do in that moment than to do

4471
01:58:22,471 --> 01:58:22,741
that?

4472
01:58:22,741 --> 01:58:24,180
That was the fucking right thing to do.

4473
01:58:24,181 --> 01:58:25,560
I think self defense right there,

4474
01:58:25,830 --> 01:58:26,940
you're in a bad position.

4475
01:58:26,941 --> 01:58:27,181
You're like,

4476
01:58:27,181 --> 01:58:27,591
oh fuck,

4477
01:58:27,591 --> 01:58:29,130
I got to get back to where I'm set.

4478
01:58:29,131 --> 01:58:30,590
I'm going to recitals.

4479
01:58:30,930 --> 01:58:32,520
Then why don't more guys run?

4480
01:58:33,150 --> 01:58:33,640
Well,

4481
01:58:33,640 --> 01:58:35,630
maybe that's the best forms.

4482
01:58:35,650 --> 01:58:37,030
A five round fight for heavyweight.

4483
01:58:37,080 --> 01:58:37,770
You're going to,

4484
01:58:37,770 --> 01:58:38,820
I don't think it's the best.

4485
01:58:39,090 --> 01:58:39,570
I mean,

4486
01:58:39,570 --> 01:58:42,010
but if that's he had at that

4487
01:58:42,010 --> 01:58:42,640
moment,

4488
01:58:42,640 --> 01:58:42,911
you know,

4489
01:58:42,911 --> 01:58:43,121
I mean,

4490
01:58:43,121 --> 01:58:43,781
it's not the best.

4491
01:58:43,781 --> 01:58:47,830
Like there's guys that fight
like maybe not in that division,

4492
01:58:47,831 --> 01:58:48,680
but there's guys that felt,

4493
01:58:48,690 --> 01:58:48,941
okay,

4494
01:58:48,941 --> 01:58:49,810
here's a perfect example.

4495
01:58:49,811 --> 01:58:50,471
Kane came,

4496
01:58:50,471 --> 01:58:51,304
we never do that.

4497
01:58:51,700 --> 01:58:52,121
Never seen it.

4498
01:58:52,121 --> 01:58:53,590
That you'd never gonna sit that over.

4499
01:58:53,640 --> 01:58:53,860
Yeah.

4500
01:58:53,860 --> 01:58:56,080
It's not even in their brain to run.

4501
01:58:56,260 --> 01:58:58,180
They don't have that pain's going to turn,

4502
01:58:58,181 --> 01:58:58,991
plant himself,

4503
01:58:58,991 --> 01:58:59,611
fire back,

4504
01:58:59,611 --> 01:59:01,240
try to take you down
and try to crack on you,

4505
01:59:01,241 --> 01:59:02,074
whatever it is,

4506
01:59:02,290 --> 01:59:02,591
you know,

4507
01:59:02,591 --> 01:59:04,960
and probably for doom is
not going to run like that.

4508
01:59:04,961 --> 01:59:05,231
Either.

4509
01:59:05,231 --> 01:59:07,480
Renew we're doing is going to look for
the clinch or he's going to try to take

4510
01:59:07,481 --> 01:59:08,670
you down as you move in like that.

4511
01:59:08,671 --> 01:59:10,210
I'm another heavyweight
that run like that.

4512
01:59:10,420 --> 01:59:11,253
Nobody,

4513
01:59:11,350 --> 01:59:12,310
nobody currently,

4514
01:59:12,460 --> 01:59:12,790
nope.

4515
01:59:12,790 --> 01:59:13,690
Nobody currently,

4516
01:59:13,870 --> 01:59:15,040
and there won't be a trend of it.

4517
01:59:15,041 --> 01:59:16,170
I would no guaranteed.

4518
01:59:16,171 --> 01:59:19,570
I think that was a high pressure situation
and he thought that was his best move

4519
01:59:19,571 --> 01:59:20,350
at the time.

4520
01:59:20,350 --> 01:59:22,360
But if you looked at what he
did with junior dos Santos,

4521
01:59:22,361 --> 01:59:24,400
he did a less extreme version of that.

4522
01:59:24,640 --> 01:59:25,750
He did a lot of moving away,

4523
01:59:25,751 --> 01:59:29,140
but he landed hard shots then
ultimately knocked junior outs.

4524
01:59:29,141 --> 01:59:30,370
Everybody forgave him for it.

4525
01:59:30,400 --> 01:59:31,120
Correct.

4526
01:59:31,120 --> 01:59:34,950
But it's that kind of movement moving
away from the conflict and ticking it's

4527
01:59:35,250 --> 01:59:36,041
best chance to win.

4528
01:59:36,041 --> 01:59:37,570
Two is if you look at Steve Bay's,

4529
01:59:37,571 --> 01:59:37,931
when he,

4530
01:59:37,931 --> 01:59:39,190
when he gets a guy against the cage,

4531
01:59:39,191 --> 01:59:40,540
he goes to work.

4532
01:59:40,640 --> 01:59:41,351
So maybe he was like,

4533
01:59:41,351 --> 01:59:41,621
you know what,

4534
01:59:41,621 --> 01:59:42,281
I'm just gonna Reset.

4535
01:59:42,281 --> 01:59:42,851
Go the center,

4536
01:59:42,851 --> 01:59:43,220
keep going.

4537
01:59:43,220 --> 01:59:46,870
Recentering cause we know how good steep
is with his game plan and back me up to

4538
01:59:46,871 --> 01:59:47,470
the cage.

4539
01:59:47,470 --> 01:59:49,210
I don't know anything about his grappling.

4540
01:59:49,360 --> 01:59:49,840
Tell me,

4541
01:59:49,840 --> 01:59:52,360
tell me who's Steve Bay
is a really good wrestler.

4542
01:59:52,400 --> 01:59:54,100
Recent College.

4543
01:59:54,580 --> 01:59:55,450
I heard he was a wrestler.

4544
01:59:55,510 --> 01:59:56,141
Let's pull it up.

4545
01:59:56,141 --> 01:59:57,100
Pull it all dress right.

4546
01:59:57,100 --> 01:59:57,933
Cleveland state.

4547
01:59:57,990 --> 01:59:58,870
So Division One.

4548
01:59:58,871 --> 01:59:59,021
Yeah.

4549
01:59:59,021 --> 02:00:00,820
And then so real good athlete and others.

4550
02:00:01,360 --> 02:00:01,601
Well,

4551
02:00:01,601 --> 02:00:02,081
baseball,

4552
02:00:02,081 --> 02:00:02,770
he's base plate.

4553
02:00:02,770 --> 02:00:04,510
Went wanted to play professional baseball.

4554
02:00:04,630 --> 02:00:06,010
His jujitsu's very good.

4555
02:00:06,030 --> 02:00:07,450
What Bell's not offensively.

4556
02:00:07,840 --> 02:00:08,673
Defensively.

4557
02:00:09,030 --> 02:00:09,470
Uh,

4558
02:00:09,470 --> 02:00:11,080
I don't think he's not high level train,

4559
02:00:11,081 --> 02:00:13,180
but his defense is amazing.

4560
02:00:13,600 --> 02:00:15,940
He's like Rashad Evans has defense.

4561
02:00:16,020 --> 02:00:16,591
Not really.

4562
02:00:16,591 --> 02:00:17,950
I no submission wins.

4563
02:00:17,980 --> 02:00:18,201
No,

4564
02:00:18,201 --> 02:00:18,610
no,

4565
02:00:18,610 --> 02:00:19,990
not a big disguise.

4566
02:00:20,500 --> 02:00:23,080
What about his striking specifically
blocks and golden gloves?

4567
02:00:23,081 --> 02:00:24,550
Champ from Cleveland.

4568
02:00:24,580 --> 02:00:25,540
Very good technique.

4569
02:00:25,541 --> 02:00:28,690
You see what he had going
house to her college wrestler,

4570
02:00:28,691 --> 02:00:29,950
Division One College Wrestler,

4571
02:00:30,300 --> 02:00:31,660
a college baseball player.

4572
02:00:31,740 --> 02:00:35,710
Do you see when he had a Alster against
the ropes or against the cage and just

4573
02:00:35,770 --> 02:00:37,450
hit crisp combinations?

4574
02:00:37,530 --> 02:00:38,350
Oh yeah.

4575
02:00:38,350 --> 02:00:38,591
Top,

4576
02:00:38,591 --> 02:00:38,801
top,

4577
02:00:38,801 --> 02:00:38,981
top,

4578
02:00:38,981 --> 02:00:39,161
top,

4579
02:00:39,161 --> 02:00:39,341
top,

4580
02:00:39,341 --> 02:00:39,850
top.

4581
02:00:39,850 --> 02:00:41,980
This fight is a motherfucker
head like a pit bull.

4582
02:00:42,040 --> 02:00:42,940
You can take a shot.

4583
02:00:46,390 --> 02:00:47,440
This fights going to be fun.

4584
02:00:48,700 --> 02:00:49,660
I'm excited for this,

4585
02:00:50,150 --> 02:00:51,460
but yeah,

4586
02:00:51,520 --> 02:00:52,353
she'd be a good one.

4587
02:00:52,650 --> 02:00:54,220
You have the heavyweight divisions in a,

4588
02:00:54,221 --> 02:00:55,990
in an unusual position right now.

4589
02:00:56,020 --> 02:00:56,411
You know,

4590
02:00:56,411 --> 02:00:58,030
it's really interesting
to see what happens.

4591
02:00:58,330 --> 02:00:59,590
Really interesting to see.

4592
02:00:59,610 --> 02:01:00,310
Um,

4593
02:01:00,310 --> 02:01:02,920
how well Keynes recovered from surgery.

4594
02:01:03,160 --> 02:01:05,620
Obviously he looked like a
monster again against Travis.

4595
02:01:05,800 --> 02:01:07,090
That looks like the cane of old,

4596
02:01:07,480 --> 02:01:09,530
you know Cain steep based the flight.

4597
02:01:09,540 --> 02:01:10,373
It's the only fight.

4598
02:01:10,810 --> 02:01:11,230
Yeah,

4599
02:01:11,230 --> 02:01:14,000
that's what you guys think about
Tony Ferguson versus dos Anjos.

4600
02:01:14,480 --> 02:01:17,530
That's a mother fucking fight
and it's in Mexico City.

4601
02:01:17,531 --> 02:01:18,970
Kids dog.

4602
02:01:19,180 --> 02:01:19,601
Tony.

4603
02:01:19,601 --> 02:01:21,490
I'm going to be in big
bear for four weeks.

4604
02:01:21,570 --> 02:01:23,570
I instagrammed a picture
from big barriers.

4605
02:01:23,590 --> 02:01:24,880
He at Tito's hold joint.

4606
02:01:25,300 --> 02:01:25,631
No,

4607
02:01:25,631 --> 02:01:29,390
he's gonna run his own house
and Geo Chai compel out.

4608
02:01:30,640 --> 02:01:33,310
We're all going to go up there
and wrote a great fight man.

4609
02:01:33,460 --> 02:01:34,750
When Tito was in his prime,

4610
02:01:34,751 --> 02:01:36,130
he bought Oscar de la Hoya,

4611
02:01:36,131 --> 02:01:37,180
his training camp up there.

4612
02:01:37,181 --> 02:01:38,440
It's dope as fuck man.

4613
02:01:38,470 --> 02:01:39,303
I heard it's,

4614
02:01:39,560 --> 02:01:40,310
he had the cage

4615
02:01:40,310 --> 02:01:42,100
set up there and he would
do all his training.

4616
02:01:42,470 --> 02:01:43,460
He still owns it,

4617
02:01:43,690 --> 02:01:44,290
does he?

4618
02:01:44,290 --> 02:01:46,700
He was on our show and I think
you said he's still owns it.

4619
02:01:46,740 --> 02:01:48,130
Maybe Mosley has one too.

4620
02:01:48,131 --> 02:01:50,060
And he was out to uh,

4621
02:01:50,150 --> 02:01:50,950
to Canelo.

4622
02:01:50,950 --> 02:01:53,210
Canelo has a spot in San Diego.

4623
02:01:53,940 --> 02:01:56,390
We got to talking about how um,

4624
02:01:56,930 --> 02:01:59,470
being at an altitude
or being a big barrier,

4625
02:01:59,500 --> 02:02:02,960
it doesn't work as far as
l two wise because it was
still do it to get like away

4626
02:02:02,961 --> 02:02:04,770
from the world and get like focused on it.

4627
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:06,110
What do you mean by it doesn't work?

4628
02:02:06,220 --> 02:02:08,390
Certainly there's arguments about um,

4629
02:02:08,660 --> 02:02:13,660
it's better to sleep low or to train low
and then see Pi and then people go up

4630
02:02:14,121 --> 02:02:14,781
there to big bear,

4631
02:02:14,781 --> 02:02:15,561
which if you're not there,

4632
02:02:15,561 --> 02:02:18,200
I guess the argument is free not there
for a long enough period of time.

4633
02:02:18,700 --> 02:02:21,380
They are actually getting less out of
your workouts because it's harder because

4634
02:02:21,381 --> 02:02:23,020
you can't breathe and
then it links it actually,

4635
02:02:23,090 --> 02:02:24,570
which is the whole concept behind it.

4636
02:02:24,570 --> 02:02:25,160
Yeah,

4637
02:02:25,160 --> 02:02:26,030
I do like the,

4638
02:02:26,090 --> 02:02:28,040
when you were asking what I do for cardio,

4639
02:02:28,041 --> 02:02:28,820
like I'll do a,

4640
02:02:28,820 --> 02:02:30,950
and I've been doing it for
fucking years and years now.

4641
02:02:31,370 --> 02:02:35,270
Probably since I really took off my
career was a high altitude training with

4642
02:02:35,271 --> 02:02:35,940
the,

4643
02:02:35,940 --> 02:02:39,230
I have like a machine that pumps
nitrogen so you're actually getting less.

4644
02:02:39,710 --> 02:02:42,020
It's simulates whatever altitude
that you want and what do you do?

4645
02:02:42,021 --> 02:02:44,750
Like a sprints on a
treadmill I'll do like a,

4646
02:02:44,950 --> 02:02:46,270
I'll as soon as I signed the papers,

4647
02:02:46,300 --> 02:02:47,420
if I have six weeks,

4648
02:02:47,421 --> 02:02:47,811
eight weeks,

4649
02:02:47,811 --> 02:02:48,860
however long it is for the fight,

4650
02:02:48,861 --> 02:02:52,520
like I just started sleeping and using
it when I sleep and then as I had my

4651
02:02:52,521 --> 02:02:55,010
cardio gets good and I'm starting to
feel confident in my cardio and I need to

4652
02:02:55,011 --> 02:02:56,270
start working it and testing it.

4653
02:02:56,690 --> 02:03:01,550
Then I'll start doing like
a tabata sprints with the
fucking the mask at 10,000

4654
02:03:01,551 --> 02:03:02,800
feet on the trek.

4655
02:03:03,140 --> 02:03:05,820
Kirsten has been doing it on like
a treadmill a lot or not tribal,

4656
02:03:05,821 --> 02:03:06,654
a rowing machine.

4657
02:03:07,190 --> 02:03:08,450
But then I live in do pad work.

4658
02:03:08,451 --> 02:03:10,820
I do bag work or to do all kinds
of shit with that fucking thing.

4659
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:12,660
You're not just a device.

4660
02:03:12,720 --> 02:03:14,530
Are you talking about
that training mass thing?

4661
02:03:15,030 --> 02:03:16,680
Fuck that mass and that
that was going to say,

4662
02:03:17,040 --> 02:03:21,440
actually I'd say a hypoxic co is the
brand and it's this big machine and it

4663
02:03:21,441 --> 02:03:22,490
pumps nitrogen.

4664
02:03:22,491 --> 02:03:26,870
And so as the same you're taking the same
breasts but like volume wise of those

4665
02:03:26,871 --> 02:03:31,871
same breasts where I'm breathing oxygen
now it would be 80% oxygen at 20%

4666
02:03:32,871 --> 02:03:33,350
nitrogen,

4667
02:03:33,350 --> 02:03:35,330
which lowers the amount of
oxygen that you're breathing.

4668
02:03:35,360 --> 02:03:39,950
And what that does is it tricks your
attends this makes your body golf.

4669
02:03:39,951 --> 02:03:40,161
Fuck,

4670
02:03:40,161 --> 02:03:42,410
I'm not getting enough air out of edge.

4671
02:03:42,530 --> 02:03:43,670
Each breath I need to be more,

4672
02:03:44,480 --> 02:03:45,313
more uh,

4673
02:03:45,320 --> 02:03:45,950
whatever.

4674
02:03:45,950 --> 02:03:49,500
So you'll body will release e uh,

4675
02:03:50,450 --> 02:03:53,870
red blood cells from your bone marrow and
that's how you increase your red blood

4676
02:03:53,871 --> 02:03:54,704
cell or home.

4677
02:03:54,880 --> 02:03:55,340
Hmm.

4678
02:03:55,340 --> 02:03:56,173
That's like safe.

4679
02:03:56,200 --> 02:03:56,540
Which is,

4680
02:03:56,540 --> 02:03:57,151
which is what the,

4681
02:03:57,151 --> 02:04:02,151
it's like that's blood doping but it's
like on like a way lower scale Ganguly

4682
02:04:02,420 --> 02:04:03,230
yeah.

4683
02:04:03,230 --> 02:04:04,880
My coach notices it right away.

4684
02:04:04,910 --> 02:04:09,110
When I started using it like the a
year lytec acid buildup and like your,

4685
02:04:09,111 --> 02:04:11,120
your cardio will increase
every time you do it.

4686
02:04:11,420 --> 02:04:12,201
And you do.

4687
02:04:12,201 --> 02:04:14,690
How many of those a week peak training?

4688
02:04:14,840 --> 02:04:17,150
When I'm like peak it and
like it depends on every,

4689
02:04:17,180 --> 02:04:17,571
like I said,

4690
02:04:17,571 --> 02:04:18,321
every camp is different,

4691
02:04:18,321 --> 02:04:20,450
but like I'll try and I'll at least twice,

4692
02:04:20,451 --> 02:04:20,890
three times.

4693
02:04:20,890 --> 02:04:21,360
But you're seeing it.

4694
02:04:21,360 --> 02:04:22,450
I'm sleeping in at night.

4695
02:04:22,550 --> 02:04:23,040
Yeah.

4696
02:04:23,040 --> 02:04:24,260
It was one of those tests.

4697
02:04:24,560 --> 02:04:28,400
I had the big tent and by chick
didn't like it and the tent was like,

4698
02:04:28,401 --> 02:04:33,080
to say it was like too big because it
was like a room and the room it gets hot

4699
02:04:33,110 --> 02:04:35,120
and then it smells like you're
sleeping on the fucking tent.

4700
02:04:36,200 --> 02:04:37,140
I had one of my son,

4701
02:04:37,560 --> 02:04:38,100
I was like awesome.

4702
02:04:38,100 --> 02:04:38,933
Like soup.

4703
02:04:39,050 --> 02:04:39,883
Yeah.

4704
02:04:40,480 --> 02:04:40,770
Yeah.

4705
02:04:40,770 --> 02:04:41,100
No.

4706
02:04:41,100 --> 02:04:43,290
Well it's a big ass fucked
your whole night up.

4707
02:04:43,540 --> 02:04:47,490
It's a big ass tenant has like my fucking
dressers and like it's a fucking room

4708
02:04:47,491 --> 02:04:48,324
in the room.

4709
02:04:48,480 --> 02:04:49,770
So then I ended up getting a,

4710
02:04:49,771 --> 02:04:50,604
uh,

4711
02:04:50,660 --> 02:04:51,360
like a,

4712
02:04:51,360 --> 02:04:52,140
a pod.

4713
02:04:52,140 --> 02:04:52,411
No,

4714
02:04:52,411 --> 02:04:53,430
like I fucking made it.

4715
02:04:53,431 --> 02:04:53,890
I was,

4716
02:04:53,890 --> 02:04:54,691
it's actually really,

4717
02:04:54,691 --> 02:04:54,771
well,

4718
02:04:54,771 --> 02:04:56,630
I wonder if I have a picture oppressive.

4719
02:04:56,640 --> 02:05:00,870
I'm in the air that we got like
these plastic bins at home depot,

4720
02:05:00,871 --> 02:05:02,160
the biggest plastic bin and could find,

4721
02:05:02,161 --> 02:05:04,310
I cut like one wall off of it.

4722
02:05:04,350 --> 02:05:04,741
I'm like,

4723
02:05:04,741 --> 02:05:06,810
kidding thing in the back.

4724
02:05:06,811 --> 02:05:07,644
And then I got a,

4725
02:05:07,660 --> 02:05:08,190
uh,

4726
02:05:08,190 --> 02:05:13,190
a sheet like a tarp and I ain't
get so it's inside of the inside.

4727
02:05:13,531 --> 02:05:14,580
Like when I lay in,

4728
02:05:14,700 --> 02:05:17,160
there's like a fucking
plastic bin over my head.

4729
02:05:17,250 --> 02:05:17,470
Damn.

4730
02:05:17,470 --> 02:05:21,480
Hema Gaiman is out plastic tarp was lays
over the sheets or whatever and it was

4731
02:05:21,481 --> 02:05:23,430
pumping the how you sleep.

4732
02:05:23,470 --> 02:05:24,380
I love that word.

4733
02:05:24,440 --> 02:05:25,740
So it definitely works.

4734
02:05:26,260 --> 02:05:27,093
Definitely works

4735
02:05:29,250 --> 02:05:29,550
dude.

4736
02:05:29,550 --> 02:05:30,660
I'm gonna see if I find them on the phone.

4737
02:05:30,661 --> 02:05:31,494
Bless you man.

4738
02:05:31,520 --> 02:05:35,400
It can't be like paranoid of close
spaces when you're in a spot like that.

4739
02:05:35,430 --> 02:05:35,700
No.

4740
02:05:35,700 --> 02:05:37,020
You chick sleep with you two in there.

4741
02:05:37,290 --> 02:05:40,320
That's the only way that she would like
do it cause she didn't want the biggest

4742
02:05:40,321 --> 02:05:41,154
10 anymore.

4743
02:05:41,790 --> 02:05:44,470
Now I have like sometimes like she'll
get in there but like she didn't like it

4744
02:05:44,471 --> 02:05:45,840
and then it's really way too close.

4745
02:05:46,290 --> 02:05:47,123
That's hilarious.

4746
02:05:47,150 --> 02:05:47,983
She should do.

4747
02:05:48,720 --> 02:05:49,270
But that a,

4748
02:05:49,270 --> 02:05:50,370
it does really increase your,

4749
02:05:50,390 --> 02:05:50,980
um,

4750
02:05:50,980 --> 02:05:51,741
like your,

4751
02:05:51,741 --> 02:05:52,770
your car do it this way.

4752
02:05:53,220 --> 02:05:54,150
Have you been one of those Joe?

4753
02:05:54,200 --> 02:05:54,611
No.

4754
02:05:54,611 --> 02:05:54,781
No.

4755
02:05:54,781 --> 02:05:56,370
I never slept one of the nice home one.

4756
02:05:57,270 --> 02:05:57,571
Yeah,

4757
02:05:57,571 --> 02:05:58,800
the soup thinks hilarious.

4758
02:05:58,810 --> 02:06:01,200
Would you own chamber?

4759
02:06:01,310 --> 02:06:01,951
Hyperbolic.

4760
02:06:01,951 --> 02:06:02,820
A hyperbolic.

4761
02:06:02,870 --> 02:06:03,990
A hyperbolic,

4762
02:06:04,110 --> 02:06:05,040
so it was less oxygen.

4763
02:06:05,041 --> 02:06:08,960
Like when I was talking to us and it
was one of those like pods and Barrick.

4764
02:06:09,370 --> 02:06:10,500
I watched all these things.

4765
02:06:10,510 --> 02:06:12,180
You see that one on the top left?

4766
02:06:12,181 --> 02:06:13,530
It's like just over his head.

4767
02:06:13,650 --> 02:06:13,831
Yeah.

4768
02:06:13,831 --> 02:06:14,770
It looks like that's what I,

4769
02:06:14,780 --> 02:06:15,613
that's what I

4770
02:06:17,640 --> 02:06:21,210
click one gentlemen is try
and take your rod hall down.

4771
02:06:21,211 --> 02:06:23,550
You write all props to
Joe making your own shit.

4772
02:06:23,580 --> 02:06:24,420
That's insane.

4773
02:06:24,590 --> 02:06:25,423
Yeah.

4774
02:06:25,830 --> 02:06:27,210
Slang those dogs,

4775
02:06:27,211 --> 02:06:28,170
hyperbaric chambers,

4776
02:06:28,171 --> 02:06:31,260
that's or hypo barrack or
hyperbaric different things.

4777
02:06:31,261 --> 02:06:31,471
Right.

4778
02:06:31,471 --> 02:06:32,730
One of them was his pumps.

4779
02:06:32,790 --> 02:06:33,720
Tons of oxygen.

4780
02:06:33,721 --> 02:06:36,060
Right to you and that's just supposed
to be really good for like knock out

4781
02:06:36,061 --> 02:06:39,090
recovery and stuff like that
and then what I have is to,

4782
02:06:39,150 --> 02:06:39,931
it decreases,

4783
02:06:39,931 --> 02:06:40,210
your honor.

4784
02:06:40,210 --> 02:06:42,870
You're basically suffocating
yourself all night long.

4785
02:06:42,900 --> 02:06:43,830
Which one were you saying?

4786
02:06:44,030 --> 02:06:44,641
Your body's like,

4787
02:06:44,641 --> 02:06:45,061
oh fuck,

4788
02:06:45,061 --> 02:06:47,220
you need to be more red blood
cells because you're dark,

4789
02:06:47,300 --> 02:06:48,270
which when Shan't Shanda pumps the,

4790
02:06:48,271 --> 02:06:49,320
all the pure oxygen.

4791
02:06:49,350 --> 02:06:51,640
That's the hyper is it?

4792
02:06:52,750 --> 02:06:53,100
Isn't it?

4793
02:06:53,100 --> 02:06:53,790
That's what I had.

4794
02:06:53,790 --> 02:06:54,980
I thought it was hyperbaric.

4795
02:06:55,540 --> 02:06:56,210
Hyperbaric.

4796
02:06:56,210 --> 02:06:56,370
Yeah,

4797
02:06:56,370 --> 02:06:56,931
hyper bag.

4798
02:06:56,931 --> 02:06:57,391
That's all I had,

4799
02:06:57,391 --> 02:06:59,460
but it was soft,

4800
02:06:59,461 --> 02:07:00,990
so I guess it wasn't working as well.

4801
02:07:00,991 --> 02:07:03,630
So then I went to a guy
in la that had a hard one.

4802
02:07:03,660 --> 02:07:05,190
It was like this thick glass.

4803
02:07:06,500 --> 02:07:06,870
Well,

4804
02:07:06,870 --> 02:07:09,720
I know why you're Ryan Faber
used that after the Aldo fight,

4805
02:07:09,721 --> 02:07:12,390
their repairs leg after he got leg kicked.

4806
02:07:12,410 --> 02:07:13,110
Yeah.

4807
02:07:13,110 --> 02:07:13,681
Which is a PR.

4808
02:07:13,681 --> 02:07:16,200
It was a brutal fight to
watch his leg swole up.

4809
02:07:16,830 --> 02:07:18,720
Derek Brunson with a
good knee to the body.

4810
02:07:19,710 --> 02:07:21,300
I don't see this fight last long.

4811
02:07:23,280 --> 02:07:23,730
Well,

4812
02:07:23,730 --> 02:07:25,740
Bronson was able to stop the bum rush,

4813
02:07:25,770 --> 02:07:26,603
which is big.

4814
02:07:26,660 --> 02:07:26,760
Oh,

4815
02:07:26,760 --> 02:07:27,780
you got a lot of time though.

4816
02:07:28,620 --> 02:07:29,610
See that spinning kick,

4817
02:07:30,210 --> 02:07:32,140
powerful Jamison shorts
when you're at home.

4818
02:07:32,460 --> 02:07:33,121
Just spinning.

4819
02:07:33,121 --> 02:07:33,691
Kick man.

4820
02:07:33,691 --> 02:07:34,920
It's his straight shots.

4821
02:07:34,930 --> 02:07:35,201
He's,

4822
02:07:35,201 --> 02:07:36,550
he's so efficient

4823
02:07:36,550 --> 02:07:37,301
with his movements.

4824
02:07:37,301 --> 02:07:38,134
When he's striking,

4825
02:07:38,350 --> 02:07:39,430
he's tough to take down,

4826
02:07:39,431 --> 02:07:39,611
man.

4827
02:07:39,611 --> 02:07:40,660
He was with us at rain.

4828
02:07:40,661 --> 02:07:42,310
He's a fucking freak athlete.

4829
02:07:43,090 --> 02:07:46,880
I think his distance is really hard
to read to this movement patterns.

4830
02:07:46,881 --> 02:07:49,500
And then the distance that
your highest strikes from is

4831
02:07:52,440 --> 02:07:54,340
Bronson banks at Danforth shelling.

4832
02:07:54,580 --> 02:07:54,971
Oh,

4833
02:07:54,971 --> 02:07:56,140
that is a wrap.

4834
02:07:56,620 --> 02:07:57,820
Oh my goodness.

4835
02:07:58,240 --> 02:07:58,541
Oh,

4836
02:07:58,541 --> 02:07:59,080
dance it.

4837
02:07:59,080 --> 02:07:59,913
Dance it.

4838
02:08:01,090 --> 02:08:02,200
I'm not mad at that dance.

4839
02:08:03,040 --> 02:08:03,873
Wow.

4840
02:08:04,170 --> 02:08:05,310
Just can't get on track.

4841
02:08:05,530 --> 02:08:06,640
What do you think about that stuff?

4842
02:08:06,650 --> 02:08:07,400
That was,

4843
02:08:07,400 --> 02:08:08,233
uh,

4844
02:08:09,250 --> 02:08:09,611
you know,

4845
02:08:09,611 --> 02:08:10,710
me and what he needs to sell.

4846
02:08:11,130 --> 02:08:11,610
What do you think?

4847
02:08:11,610 --> 02:08:13,930
I think was way pretty much mature.

4848
02:08:15,700 --> 02:08:16,660
Let's see the replay.

4849
02:08:16,810 --> 02:08:17,800
It's herb dean again.

4850
02:08:17,830 --> 02:08:18,011
I mean,

4851
02:08:18,011 --> 02:08:19,550
herb dean is a bad motherfucker.

4852
02:08:19,570 --> 02:08:19,931
Dude.

4853
02:08:19,931 --> 02:08:21,430
If herb thought it was premature,

4854
02:08:21,431 --> 02:08:22,264
he might've been.

4855
02:08:22,600 --> 02:08:23,650
Herb thought it was time.

4856
02:08:23,800 --> 02:08:24,930
He might've been able to see something.

4857
02:08:25,560 --> 02:08:26,130
You know what you,

4858
02:08:26,130 --> 02:08:29,980
what kind of triggers a little bit is
Uriah went for a single leg on herb dean.

4859
02:08:30,040 --> 02:08:33,640
That's usually a bad sign he did after.

4860
02:08:33,641 --> 02:08:36,380
The fact he should have
did is after he stopped it,

4861
02:08:36,820 --> 02:08:37,840
he went for a single again.

4862
02:08:37,841 --> 02:08:38,674
Herb,

4863
02:08:40,390 --> 02:08:42,400
we're supposed to put up
a clock to sync this up.

4864
02:08:42,401 --> 02:08:43,930
Do you have a clock that syncs up Jamie?

4865
02:08:45,070 --> 02:08:45,903
Okay.

4866
02:08:46,210 --> 02:08:46,750
So far.

4867
02:08:46,750 --> 02:08:48,700
I was almost thinking about rewinding it.

4868
02:08:49,060 --> 02:08:50,110
That'll fuck up our clock,

4869
02:08:50,180 --> 02:08:50,410
right?

4870
02:08:50,410 --> 02:08:51,520
Brunton st title shot.

4871
02:08:51,550 --> 02:08:52,460
He got a relationship.

4872
02:08:52,910 --> 02:08:53,880
Same title shot.

4873
02:08:54,310 --> 02:08:55,150
You gotta relax.

4874
02:08:55,151 --> 02:08:57,340
Let's check this out here to see what God,

4875
02:08:58,380 --> 02:08:59,213
I've been there myself.

4876
02:08:59,840 --> 02:09:00,673
Good.

4877
02:09:01,150 --> 02:09:01,810
Left Hook.

4878
02:09:01,810 --> 02:09:02,400
Beautiful.

4879
02:09:02,400 --> 02:09:03,100
He's,

4880
02:09:03,100 --> 02:09:04,000
he's pounded them.

4881
02:09:04,001 --> 02:09:04,570
Boom,

4882
02:09:04,570 --> 02:09:05,190
boom.

4883
02:09:05,190 --> 02:09:05,561
Oh,

4884
02:09:05,561 --> 02:09:06,920
he's not really doing much there.

4885
02:09:07,210 --> 02:09:08,740
He get his lifted his arms up.

4886
02:09:08,860 --> 02:09:09,860
Now watch this.

4887
02:09:10,690 --> 02:09:11,740
This how you know he's fucked up.

4888
02:09:11,741 --> 02:09:13,960
Watch him shoot this
beautiful single leg on her.

4889
02:09:14,050 --> 02:09:14,231
Oh,

4890
02:09:14,231 --> 02:09:15,064
what a left.

4891
02:09:16,030 --> 02:09:16,990
Oh my goodness.

4892
02:09:18,740 --> 02:09:18,900
Oh,

4893
02:09:18,900 --> 02:09:21,160
he his head him.

4894
02:09:22,360 --> 02:09:22,601
No,

4895
02:09:22,601 --> 02:09:22,841
no,

4896
02:09:22,841 --> 02:09:23,051
no.

4897
02:09:23,051 --> 02:09:24,520
You've got to give a
guy a chance to recover.

4898
02:09:24,530 --> 02:09:25,363
Who wasn't even hitting him.

4899
02:09:25,390 --> 02:09:26,320
That's a little premature.

4900
02:09:26,321 --> 02:09:27,430
He was fucked up though.

4901
02:09:27,610 --> 02:09:29,000
I mean he definitely got tacked up.

4902
02:09:29,001 --> 02:09:29,610
We're getting dropped.

4903
02:09:29,610 --> 02:09:29,980
I just,

4904
02:09:29,980 --> 02:09:30,910
I don't agree with that.

4905
02:09:30,940 --> 02:09:33,130
He was trying to move
Herb's a little off tonight.

4906
02:09:33,131 --> 02:09:34,030
Can we all agree on that?

4907
02:09:34,180 --> 02:09:34,841
We're all friends.

4908
02:09:34,841 --> 02:09:35,380
We all love him.

4909
02:09:35,380 --> 02:09:35,711
No,

4910
02:09:35,711 --> 02:09:36,544
he's definitely,

4911
02:09:37,770 --> 02:09:38,603
I think this,

4912
02:09:38,980 --> 02:09:39,700
this was off.

4913
02:09:39,700 --> 02:09:40,600
Cut Him some slack.

4914
02:09:40,720 --> 02:09:41,381
This was off.

4915
02:09:41,381 --> 02:09:42,520
That's such a great job.

4916
02:09:43,390 --> 02:09:43,960
Yeah.

4917
02:09:43,960 --> 02:09:44,950
Herb's having an off night.

4918
02:09:44,951 --> 02:09:47,050
Everyone has an offline
in the office sometimes.

4919
02:09:48,480 --> 02:09:49,151
I don't know man.

4920
02:09:49,151 --> 02:09:50,310
I mean it's,

4921
02:09:50,340 --> 02:09:53,770
it's interesting because I would like
to see Brunson actually finish it.

4922
02:09:53,771 --> 02:09:54,251
Finish it.

4923
02:09:54,251 --> 02:09:56,890
I mean I think maybe if you gave him more
time he would have been able to finish

4924
02:09:56,891 --> 02:10:00,340
it conclusively and we wouldn't be
sitting here doing this and it would still

4925
02:10:00,670 --> 02:10:02,800
cause you don't want to take
anything away from that left hook.

4926
02:10:02,801 --> 02:10:04,180
That was beautiful that you know what?

4927
02:10:04,180 --> 02:10:05,080
That was a little premature.

4928
02:10:05,140 --> 02:10:05,740
I agree with that.

4929
02:10:05,740 --> 02:10:05,870
He,

4930
02:10:05,870 --> 02:10:06,340
this time,

4931
02:10:06,340 --> 02:10:08,230
I think it was premature and tears money,

4932
02:10:08,500 --> 02:10:08,961
they'll left.

4933
02:10:08,961 --> 02:10:10,450
The other ones didn't get
it cause you know what?

4934
02:10:10,451 --> 02:10:13,180
When he shot that single leg
to get up on her right away,

4935
02:10:13,181 --> 02:10:13,430
he was like,

4936
02:10:13,430 --> 02:10:13,870
Yo,

4937
02:10:13,870 --> 02:10:14,703
what the fuck?

4938
02:10:14,790 --> 02:10:15,730
He also grabbed him.

4939
02:10:15,731 --> 02:10:16,000
I was like,

4940
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:16,661
Oh shit.

4941
02:10:16,661 --> 02:10:17,101
Come on man.

4942
02:10:17,101 --> 02:10:18,010
Why is your leg here?

4943
02:10:18,340 --> 02:10:19,450
Why do you have pants on?

4944
02:10:19,510 --> 02:10:20,343
What's going on here?

4945
02:10:20,710 --> 02:10:23,860
I mean he was turned up and
probably closing his eyes,

4946
02:10:23,861 --> 02:10:27,550
you know turtled up trying to avoid the
punches that were coming in his face.

4947
02:10:27,790 --> 02:10:28,870
But who knows?

4948
02:10:29,140 --> 02:10:30,760
It just seemed like they didn't land.

4949
02:10:30,970 --> 02:10:32,740
It's like he got hit
with that one big shot.

4950
02:10:32,741 --> 02:10:33,260
He goes,

4951
02:10:33,260 --> 02:10:34,010
but then the two

4952
02:10:34,010 --> 02:10:34,880
afterwards,

4953
02:10:35,030 --> 02:10:36,500
they were kind of deflect his head.

4954
02:10:36,501 --> 02:10:37,040
Was it?

4955
02:10:37,040 --> 02:10:37,460
He was,

4956
02:10:37,460 --> 02:10:41,480
he wasn't doing what a guy who was
conscious with do with his head or neck.

4957
02:10:41,481 --> 02:10:43,130
I feel like he was certainly conscious.

4958
02:10:43,160 --> 02:10:45,170
It's a matter of how compromised he was.

4959
02:10:45,190 --> 02:10:45,550
Yeah.

4960
02:10:45,550 --> 02:10:47,030
Well cause if you look at it,

4961
02:10:47,031 --> 02:10:48,170
the head's not moving at all.

4962
02:10:48,171 --> 02:10:48,741
You know what I'm saying?

4963
02:10:48,741 --> 02:10:49,120
Like he's,

4964
02:10:49,120 --> 02:10:50,810
it says not reacting to anything.

4965
02:10:50,870 --> 02:10:53,330
His arms are up stiff and it's not moving,

4966
02:10:53,750 --> 02:10:57,110
but it was enough to stop the two punches
that he was trying to throw at him

4967
02:10:57,111 --> 02:10:58,260
from hitting them all is,

4968
02:10:58,270 --> 02:10:59,750
is that him or is that bad?

4969
02:10:59,960 --> 02:11:00,793
Is it a shot?

4970
02:11:01,310 --> 02:11:01,561
Right.

4971
02:11:01,561 --> 02:11:02,900
We're on the fence about that.

4972
02:11:03,140 --> 02:11:04,010
I think you let it go.

4973
02:11:04,040 --> 02:11:05,090
I agree with you on this one.

4974
02:11:05,120 --> 02:11:05,661
I agree with you.

4975
02:11:05,661 --> 02:11:07,130
Here's where you give the herb dean.

4976
02:11:07,131 --> 02:11:10,440
The benefit of the doubt though said herb
was looking in his eyes while all the

4977
02:11:10,441 --> 02:11:12,800
shit was going down and he
might've not been there.

4978
02:11:12,850 --> 02:11:13,340
I agree.

4979
02:11:13,340 --> 02:11:18,340
He might've been off in the dark lands
or wrangle from different from the camera

4980
02:11:19,650 --> 02:11:21,290
is it actually looks
like he's getting hit.

4981
02:11:21,320 --> 02:11:21,591
Yeah,

4982
02:11:21,591 --> 02:11:23,120
horses are angle just as better.

4983
02:11:23,860 --> 02:11:24,693
Maybe.

4984
02:11:24,760 --> 02:11:25,593
You know,

4985
02:11:25,820 --> 02:11:28,370
I would say that herb has
the best view ever though.

4986
02:11:28,371 --> 02:11:29,204
Right?

4987
02:11:29,250 --> 02:11:30,740
Top of them ever.

4988
02:11:30,830 --> 02:11:31,663
It's interesting.

4989
02:11:31,670 --> 02:11:32,503
It's hard to,

4990
02:11:32,990 --> 02:11:34,880
hard to really predict.

4991
02:11:35,570 --> 02:11:36,500
Where are they tonight?

4992
02:11:37,350 --> 02:11:38,870
Hildago where the hell is that?

4993
02:11:39,290 --> 02:11:41,450
South Texas near the border of Mexico.

4994
02:11:41,451 --> 02:11:46,451
Cause I put Hashtag where the fuck is
Hilton and then Pique some guys like I'm

4995
02:11:46,851 --> 02:11:47,090
out.

4996
02:11:47,090 --> 02:11:48,420
I'm from their asshole.

4997
02:11:49,520 --> 02:11:53,470
If you're from Hildago closest
major city to rattle dog Max.

4998
02:11:53,620 --> 02:11:55,950
Whereas for as,

4999
02:11:55,960 --> 02:11:56,420
yeah,

5000
02:11:56,420 --> 02:11:57,350
I actually don't know.

5001
02:11:57,351 --> 02:11:58,184
I have no idea.

5002
02:11:58,880 --> 02:11:59,713
Don't quote me on that.

5003
02:11:59,720 --> 02:12:00,501
If you want to fly in,

5004
02:12:00,501 --> 02:12:04,240
you got to fly to Mexico and they
take you over on some sort of a shot.

5005
02:12:04,241 --> 02:12:04,700
Am I right?

5006
02:12:04,700 --> 02:12:05,533
Yeah.

5007
02:12:05,750 --> 02:12:06,980
No it isn't right on the border.

5008
02:12:07,250 --> 02:12:08,660
Public schools paying off son.

5009
02:12:09,320 --> 02:12:09,561
Wow,

5010
02:12:09,561 --> 02:12:09,830
that's,

5011
02:12:09,830 --> 02:12:11,150
that's really right on the border.

5012
02:12:11,180 --> 02:12:13,040
How many miles is it from
the border of Mexico?

5013
02:12:13,530 --> 02:12:14,630
Let's just do it in Mexico.

5014
02:12:14,631 --> 02:12:15,410
Hong Yossi.

5015
02:12:15,410 --> 02:12:16,280
Holy Shit.

5016
02:12:16,410 --> 02:12:17,720
Oh God.

5017
02:12:17,721 --> 02:12:20,030
It's right there at about wars.

5018
02:12:20,240 --> 02:12:23,150
They should've just brought an all Mexican
fighters and treat it like a Mexico

5019
02:12:23,151 --> 02:12:23,810
City card.

5020
02:12:23,810 --> 02:12:26,570
Doesn't have cartel is
there's the security sick,

5021
02:12:27,560 --> 02:12:28,221
fucking sick,

5022
02:12:28,221 --> 02:12:31,100
and then they all come out to
Mariachi bands and narco songs.

5023
02:12:31,250 --> 02:12:31,670
Yeah.

5024
02:12:31,670 --> 02:12:32,750
They're all at the Canelo fight.

5025
02:12:32,751 --> 02:12:33,000
But you,

5026
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:33,440
it'd be,

5027
02:12:33,440 --> 02:12:33,890
that's right.

5028
02:12:33,890 --> 02:12:34,190
Yeah.

5029
02:12:34,190 --> 02:12:36,430
That's what they do in
the Dallas Stadium Son.

5030
02:12:36,880 --> 02:12:37,670
How about Liam Smith?

5031
02:12:37,670 --> 02:12:40,310
He's never fought outside the UK and like,

5032
02:12:40,400 --> 02:12:40,551
oh,

5033
02:12:40,551 --> 02:12:40,940
cool.

5034
02:12:40,940 --> 02:12:43,880
Here's Canelo in Dallas stadium sold out.

5035
02:12:43,910 --> 02:12:45,370
Get you somehow.

5036
02:12:46,320 --> 02:12:47,870
Was it the 50,000 people?

5037
02:12:48,200 --> 02:12:49,120
60 something.

5038
02:12:49,400 --> 02:12:51,860
60,000 can.

5039
02:12:51,861 --> 02:12:53,810
Nelson's can sell some fucking tickets.

5040
02:12:54,260 --> 02:12:56,420
What's interesting is
Gennady Golovkin can't.

5041
02:12:56,720 --> 02:12:57,350
I know.

5042
02:12:57,350 --> 02:12:58,880
It's weird like he does pay per views.

5043
02:12:58,881 --> 02:12:59,840
They don't do well.

5044
02:12:59,900 --> 02:13:01,010
They really don't know.

5045
02:13:01,011 --> 02:13:02,750
That's why he fought an HBO last week.

5046
02:13:03,470 --> 02:13:03,681
Yeah,

5047
02:13:03,681 --> 02:13:04,220
he's not,

5048
02:13:04,220 --> 02:13:04,521
he's,

5049
02:13:04,521 --> 02:13:06,650
he's not really a paper view fighter,

5050
02:13:06,651 --> 02:13:07,101
but man,

5051
02:13:07,101 --> 02:13:07,934
in my eyes,

5052
02:13:07,970 --> 02:13:10,280
there's no more exciting
fight or maybe ever,

5053
02:13:10,790 --> 02:13:12,950
he's blood and guts nasty.

5054
02:13:13,460 --> 02:13:14,210
He's up there.

5055
02:13:14,210 --> 02:13:15,650
He's got nasty boxing,

5056
02:13:15,651 --> 02:13:16,610
beautiful movement.

5057
02:13:16,611 --> 02:13:17,211
He gets on the mic,

5058
02:13:17,211 --> 02:13:18,500
goes big drama show.

5059
02:13:18,710 --> 02:13:20,660
I'm here to try big drama show.

5060
02:13:20,790 --> 02:13:21,141
All right,

5061
02:13:21,141 --> 02:13:21,411
man.

5062
02:13:21,411 --> 02:13:24,400
We need something else on crank.

5063
02:13:24,590 --> 02:13:25,423
Here it goes.

5064
02:13:25,430 --> 02:13:26,300
So he's down.

5065
02:13:26,810 --> 02:13:27,590
Boom,

5066
02:13:27,590 --> 02:13:28,160
boom.

5067
02:13:28,160 --> 02:13:31,070
See the limp left hand and you
see the limp lefthand though.

5068
02:13:31,380 --> 02:13:32,130
Not doing

5069
02:13:32,130 --> 02:13:32,790
much.

5070
02:13:32,790 --> 02:13:33,990
It's hard to see from there.

5071
02:13:34,020 --> 02:13:34,890
Let's see it from here.

5072
02:13:35,760 --> 02:13:36,840
We can all agree on this.

5073
02:13:38,820 --> 02:13:39,601
How's it beautiful?

5074
02:13:39,601 --> 02:13:40,434
Left Hook.

5075
02:13:42,510 --> 02:13:42,810
No,

5076
02:13:42,810 --> 02:13:43,531
those don't land,

5077
02:13:43,531 --> 02:13:44,310
man.

5078
02:13:44,310 --> 02:13:46,140
Here's my thing is that he loves,

5079
02:13:46,141 --> 02:13:48,690
he's probably still fucked up from
that shot while he's down there,

5080
02:13:48,691 --> 02:13:53,070
but none that you didn't stop him from
the shot and then those three things that

5081
02:13:53,071 --> 02:13:54,360
he threw all miss.

5082
02:13:54,370 --> 02:13:54,700
What?

5083
02:13:54,700 --> 02:13:55,700
What changed?

5084
02:13:55,710 --> 02:13:56,543
You know?

5085
02:13:57,000 --> 02:13:57,510
Yeah.

5086
02:13:57,510 --> 02:13:58,890
He's certainly controversial.

5087
02:13:59,070 --> 02:14:00,840
He was definitely fucked
up on the ground there,

5088
02:14:00,900 --> 02:14:03,150
but he wasn't getting more
fucked up when he stopped in.

5089
02:14:03,480 --> 02:14:04,141
It's too bad.

5090
02:14:04,141 --> 02:14:07,140
It's controversial because Bronson
landed that perfect letters.

5091
02:14:07,160 --> 02:14:10,260
The last shot would never want to
take anything away from that moment.

5092
02:14:10,290 --> 02:14:10,710
You know?

5093
02:14:10,710 --> 02:14:11,760
That's nothing on Bronson.

5094
02:14:11,761 --> 02:14:12,001
Right?

5095
02:14:12,001 --> 02:14:12,451
But it is.

5096
02:14:12,451 --> 02:14:14,410
If everybody could says
it's a bullshit stop.

5097
02:14:14,411 --> 02:14:15,600
It just makes you feel bad.

5098
02:14:15,601 --> 02:14:17,120
But people are going to clean.

5099
02:14:17,390 --> 02:14:18,030
They are.

5100
02:14:18,030 --> 02:14:19,950
You're going to have to give
your eye a half your paycheck.

5101
02:14:19,951 --> 02:14:20,460
Now,

5102
02:14:20,460 --> 02:14:21,390
I hate to be shitty about it,

5103
02:14:21,450 --> 02:14:26,450
but could they fucking please put a 145
pound weight class in instead of having

5104
02:14:26,551 --> 02:14:29,520
Cyborg starve herself every
time they let her fight?

5105
02:14:29,820 --> 02:14:30,930
He doesn't make any sense.

5106
02:14:30,960 --> 02:14:31,480
Well,

5107
02:14:31,480 --> 02:14:32,640
because at one 45,

5108
02:14:32,641 --> 02:14:33,890
she didn't kill a bitch at least.

5109
02:14:33,891 --> 02:14:34,441
So one 40,

5110
02:14:34,441 --> 02:14:35,460
she was dehydrated.

5111
02:14:36,010 --> 02:14:38,560
What poor soul is going in
there to fight this girl?

5112
02:14:39,120 --> 02:14:41,340
Could there be a scarier
fighter and Cyborg?

5113
02:14:41,470 --> 02:14:41,670
Uh,

5114
02:14:41,670 --> 02:14:42,503
the woman,

5115
02:14:42,630 --> 02:14:46,680
Lena landsburgs her name and she's a world
Muay Thai champion and she's actually

5116
02:14:46,710 --> 02:14:47,070
a,

5117
02:14:47,070 --> 02:14:48,780
she's actually very bad ass.

5118
02:14:48,840 --> 02:14:49,830
Fantastic.

5119
02:14:49,890 --> 02:14:52,890
Fly Down Brazil and
fight Cyborg in Brazil.

5120
02:14:52,891 --> 02:14:55,080
She's going to punch
you in the face so hard.

5121
02:14:55,230 --> 02:14:56,790
Now you want to talk
about Mike Tyson effect.

5122
02:14:57,250 --> 02:14:58,083
There you go.

5123
02:14:58,590 --> 02:14:59,250
There you go.

5124
02:14:59,250 --> 02:14:59,960
Why don't you relax?

5125
02:14:59,960 --> 02:15:00,960
Who's Lena Landsberg.

5126
02:15:01,410 --> 02:15:02,580
She's a world moy.

5127
02:15:02,581 --> 02:15:03,450
Thai kickboxing.

5128
02:15:03,451 --> 02:15:04,350
She's very,

5129
02:15:04,351 --> 02:15:05,300
very good striker.

5130
02:15:05,301 --> 02:15:10,230
She got nasty elbows particularly good
in the clinch needs to the body over the

5131
02:15:10,231 --> 02:15:10,561
top.

5132
02:15:10,561 --> 02:15:10,831
Yeah.

5133
02:15:10,831 --> 02:15:11,581
And I bet she's great.

5134
02:15:11,581 --> 02:15:12,690
Anyone want to bet on that?

5135
02:15:13,560 --> 02:15:13,860
Yeah.

5136
02:15:13,860 --> 02:15:15,720
Bitch didn't even know what she was.

5137
02:15:15,730 --> 02:15:17,000
Fights like what happened you,

5138
02:15:17,080 --> 02:15:18,770
she arena Bahrain.

5139
02:15:20,020 --> 02:15:20,750
Serina bar.

5140
02:15:20,750 --> 02:15:24,800
I sure didn't [inaudible]
the same way class 35 years.

5141
02:15:24,801 --> 02:15:25,634
She's bad.

5142
02:15:27,770 --> 02:15:28,603
Yeah.

5143
02:15:29,860 --> 02:15:30,140
Yeah.

5144
02:15:30,140 --> 02:15:31,260
Cyborg is a monster.

5145
02:15:31,500 --> 02:15:32,340
She's terrifying.

5146
02:15:32,550 --> 02:15:33,690
She beats the shit out of checks,

5147
02:15:34,110 --> 02:15:36,450
but she lost two surely.

5148
02:15:36,460 --> 02:15:38,970
Gonna feed your lost two
jury in a barge in a fight.

5149
02:15:38,971 --> 02:15:39,490
We're bars.

5150
02:15:39,490 --> 02:15:40,140
Dominator.

5151
02:15:40,140 --> 02:15:40,680
There's land.

5152
02:15:40,680 --> 02:15:41,550
Lina Lansburgh.

5153
02:15:43,170 --> 02:15:44,010
She's good dude.

5154
02:15:44,490 --> 02:15:45,660
She's a good kickboxer.

5155
02:15:46,380 --> 02:15:48,160
She's got good striking good movement.

5156
02:15:48,480 --> 02:15:49,290
She's good man.

5157
02:15:49,290 --> 02:15:49,891
That's your shit,

5158
02:15:49,891 --> 02:15:50,071
right?

5159
02:15:50,071 --> 02:15:50,241
Yeah.

5160
02:15:50,241 --> 02:15:53,970
The Front Kick Jab while she throws a
round kick and then she comes from behind

5161
02:15:53,971 --> 02:15:55,590
it when you were recovering
with a right hand,

5162
02:15:56,280 --> 02:15:57,990
but she's got good
elbows in the clinch too.

5163
02:15:58,040 --> 02:15:58,831
The question is,

5164
02:15:58,831 --> 02:16:01,050
is she going to be strong enough
to keep cyborg off of her?

5165
02:16:01,560 --> 02:16:03,090
That's the real real question.

5166
02:16:03,120 --> 02:16:06,390
Is she going to keep her head
enough to use our movement?

5167
02:16:06,410 --> 02:16:07,590
Kunar technique.

5168
02:16:07,740 --> 02:16:08,790
She's fucking good dude.

5169
02:16:09,060 --> 02:16:09,930
She's a good striker.

5170
02:16:10,300 --> 02:16:11,310
Doesn't go past two rounds.

5171
02:16:12,960 --> 02:16:13,793
I don't think so.

5172
02:16:14,190 --> 02:16:14,521
Too Bad.

5173
02:16:14,521 --> 02:16:18,840
Brian counts on here to bet you in a
way where he would 12 fucking grant.

5174
02:16:18,960 --> 02:16:22,290
Those guys say if you let me
cross side rails going to hunt.

5175
02:16:24,500 --> 02:16:25,500
You got me fired up,

5176
02:16:25,501 --> 02:16:26,110
Joe.

5177
02:16:26,110 --> 02:16:26,761
I'm done.

5178
02:16:26,761 --> 02:16:28,890
Benton county basement Callen bet.

5179
02:16:29,230 --> 02:16:30,010
And then he lost the

5180
02:16:30,010 --> 02:16:31,420
second you look just go double or nothing.

5181
02:16:31,421 --> 02:16:32,350
They bet six grand.

5182
02:16:32,590 --> 02:16:33,191
He lost.

5183
02:16:33,191 --> 02:16:33,731
He's like Dell,

5184
02:16:33,731 --> 02:16:34,241
we're nothing.

5185
02:16:34,241 --> 02:16:35,920
So he loses again and now he's goes,

5186
02:16:37,540 --> 02:16:38,380
I haven't heard from him.

5187
02:16:38,620 --> 02:16:38,891
Yeah,

5188
02:16:38,891 --> 02:16:42,100
he's kept that bombing
because probably I'm safe.

5189
02:16:42,101 --> 02:16:43,180
Let's just forget about the money.

5190
02:16:43,670 --> 02:16:44,320
He said,

5191
02:16:44,320 --> 02:16:44,960
he said,

5192
02:16:44,960 --> 02:16:45,580
bomb.

5193
02:16:45,580 --> 02:16:46,500
It doesn't have to pay you.

5194
02:16:47,560 --> 02:16:48,251
I had your money.

5195
02:16:48,251 --> 02:16:49,084
We've got blown up.

5196
02:16:49,090 --> 02:16:50,290
It's fucking crazy.

5197
02:16:50,320 --> 02:16:51,090
It was going to shoot.

5198
02:16:51,090 --> 02:16:52,000
I need more time.

5199
02:16:52,030 --> 02:16:52,960
It's going to sound amazing.

5200
02:16:54,520 --> 02:16:55,353
Yeah.

5201
02:16:55,720 --> 02:16:58,240
You can't bet that those large sums,

5202
02:16:58,270 --> 02:16:59,320
unless you're going to pay up.

5203
02:16:59,680 --> 02:17:02,670
That's a lot of money that you're paying.

5204
02:17:02,690 --> 02:17:03,670
A friend was a pimp.

5205
02:17:03,671 --> 02:17:04,291
Did you guys see that?

5206
02:17:04,291 --> 02:17:04,590
Yeah,

5207
02:17:04,590 --> 02:17:06,610
that's George.

5208
02:17:06,730 --> 02:17:07,091
George.

5209
02:17:07,091 --> 02:17:08,120
What's the fuck's his name right?

5210
02:17:08,350 --> 02:17:09,183
George Hamilton.

5211
02:17:09,790 --> 02:17:11,680
They have a different Carol
Sanders every week now.

5212
02:17:11,830 --> 02:17:12,790
I liked the pimp one.

5213
02:17:12,791 --> 02:17:13,690
Rob Rickles one.

5214
02:17:13,691 --> 02:17:15,820
Now they should keep that one forever.

5215
02:17:16,620 --> 02:17:17,453
I would like to see our,

5216
02:17:17,480 --> 02:17:18,550
what was your two bets?

5217
02:17:18,580 --> 02:17:20,740
He bet on a owner ideas.

5218
02:17:20,950 --> 02:17:25,260
So he bet on Diaz and the first fight
and then he bet on Overeem in the steep

5219
02:17:25,280 --> 02:17:25,630
steep,

5220
02:17:25,630 --> 02:17:27,790
but he's the one that wanted him and I go,

5221
02:17:27,820 --> 02:17:28,121
dude,

5222
02:17:28,121 --> 02:17:29,080
I don't want just pay me.

5223
02:17:29,081 --> 02:17:29,761
My money is no,

5224
02:17:29,761 --> 02:17:30,551
no over him.

5225
02:17:30,551 --> 02:17:31,180
Steve Bay.

5226
02:17:31,180 --> 02:17:31,511
And he goes,

5227
02:17:31,511 --> 02:17:32,330
you get a pick first.

5228
02:17:32,330 --> 02:17:33,010
I'm like,

5229
02:17:33,010 --> 02:17:34,030
I'll take steep bay,

5230
02:17:34,060 --> 02:17:34,950
but you got to pay me go.

5231
02:17:34,951 --> 02:17:35,471
It's fine.

5232
02:17:35,471 --> 02:17:36,460
I'll take over him.

5233
02:17:36,910 --> 02:17:38,350
So when he lost,

5234
02:17:38,530 --> 02:17:40,630
you've guys have done podcasts since then?

5235
02:17:41,140 --> 02:17:41,561
What?

5236
02:17:41,561 --> 02:17:43,510
What kind of conversations
have you had about the money?

5237
02:17:43,511 --> 02:17:44,590
That he lost it.

5238
02:17:44,591 --> 02:17:44,891
He's like,

5239
02:17:44,891 --> 02:17:46,120
do I have to check my car?

5240
02:17:46,121 --> 02:17:46,510
Blah Blah.

5241
02:17:46,510 --> 02:17:49,020
And then we do the show and
then after you just dip south.

5242
02:17:49,630 --> 02:17:51,640
So you ask him point blank,

5243
02:17:51,641 --> 02:17:52,540
are you wanting your money?

5244
02:17:52,570 --> 02:17:52,891
Yeah.

5245
02:17:52,891 --> 02:17:53,231
And he's like,

5246
02:17:53,231 --> 02:17:54,070
I swear I'm going to pay,

5247
02:17:54,640 --> 02:17:55,231
but I run the,

5248
02:17:55,231 --> 02:17:56,800
I guess where I'm going to pay.

5249
02:17:56,860 --> 02:17:57,790
The thing is like,

5250
02:17:58,090 --> 02:17:58,390
yeah,

5251
02:17:58,390 --> 02:17:59,440
it's tough when it's a friend,

5252
02:17:59,441 --> 02:18:00,274
what are you going to do?

5253
02:18:00,280 --> 02:18:02,620
What am I going to fucking not
pay him for the tee shirts?

5254
02:18:02,640 --> 02:18:03,030
Yeah.

5255
02:18:03,030 --> 02:18:03,863
That's what I,

5256
02:18:03,960 --> 02:18:04,450
boom,

5257
02:18:04,450 --> 02:18:07,810
I could just not paying for merchandise
or are you just going to accept the fact

5258
02:18:07,811 --> 02:18:10,450
that everything with
him is sort of theater?

5259
02:18:10,630 --> 02:18:13,410
That's what I'm going to accept
that I would never take money from.

5260
02:18:13,930 --> 02:18:14,081
Yeah.

5261
02:18:14,081 --> 02:18:14,681
That's interesting.

5262
02:18:14,681 --> 02:18:14,891
I mean,

5263
02:18:14,891 --> 02:18:15,790
if he gave me a check,

5264
02:18:16,060 --> 02:18:17,020
here's a lot of money,

5265
02:18:17,021 --> 02:18:17,200
man.

5266
02:18:17,200 --> 02:18:22,200
If you lost $12,000 and came to him with
$12,000 in a bag and just handed it to

5267
02:18:25,301 --> 02:18:25,421
him,

5268
02:18:25,421 --> 02:18:26,380
pushed it over to him,

5269
02:18:26,560 --> 02:18:26,831
he said,

5270
02:18:26,831 --> 02:18:27,161
are you sure?

5271
02:18:27,161 --> 02:18:27,461
And you're like,

5272
02:18:27,461 --> 02:18:27,670
yeah,

5273
02:18:27,670 --> 02:18:28,503
you won.

5274
02:18:28,780 --> 02:18:29,980
Do you think he'd give it back to you?

5275
02:18:30,700 --> 02:18:31,390
I do.

5276
02:18:31,390 --> 02:18:31,750
Really?

5277
02:18:31,750 --> 02:18:32,180
I do.

5278
02:18:32,180 --> 02:18:32,801
Just keep going.

5279
02:18:32,801 --> 02:18:33,760
No Brian better than me,

5280
02:18:33,761 --> 02:18:34,660
but I feel like you would.

5281
02:18:36,240 --> 02:18:39,760
I just keep going double or nothing
until he wins and then there you go.

5282
02:18:39,790 --> 02:18:40,690
That's what he was hoping.

5283
02:18:40,980 --> 02:18:45,230
But now I won't bet on that
cause it because the bits
that you can't make a bid,

5284
02:18:45,800 --> 02:18:47,220
it can go before he,

5285
02:18:47,221 --> 02:18:48,340
he's eventually going to win.

5286
02:18:52,120 --> 02:18:53,910
You'd be surprised how

5287
02:18:57,370 --> 02:18:59,080
be to pay you,

5288
02:18:59,081 --> 02:19:02,230
but just see how high
you well will know it.

5289
02:19:02,231 --> 02:19:03,041
No one cares if we,

5290
02:19:03,041 --> 02:19:03,800
if they know that,

5291
02:19:03,800 --> 02:19:04,990
that he's never going to pay them.

5292
02:19:05,110 --> 02:19:05,921
Why would care wipe the,

5293
02:19:05,921 --> 02:19:06,550
here's the thing,

5294
02:19:06,550 --> 02:19:07,540
you see how you can go.

5295
02:19:07,541 --> 02:19:08,740
I have to hold them accountable.

5296
02:19:08,820 --> 02:19:12,970
It Cowan is on a plane that gets
hit by an asteroid and he dies.

5297
02:19:13,000 --> 02:19:14,350
You go after his family.

5298
02:19:14,530 --> 02:19:16,480
Yeley tell us why you got my socks.

5299
02:19:16,490 --> 02:19:17,540
I'm gonna need that 12 gauge.

5300
02:19:19,440 --> 02:19:24,440
Let's document it on and he
goes flying 5,000 you're like,

5301
02:19:24,770 --> 02:19:28,070
let me just take this test I
me listen to 12 becomes 24 real

5302
02:19:28,070 --> 02:19:28,461
quick,

5303
02:19:28,461 --> 02:19:29,001
real quick.

5304
02:19:29,001 --> 02:19:31,250
24 becomes 48 real quick.

5305
02:19:31,550 --> 02:19:34,970
You don't have becomes 24 cause he
wanted to bet on your oil versus Weidman

5306
02:19:34,971 --> 02:19:35,900
cause I want Weidman.

5307
02:19:35,950 --> 02:19:36,230
No,

5308
02:19:36,230 --> 02:19:37,220
he wants to go more.

5309
02:19:37,221 --> 02:19:37,690
He wants to go.

5310
02:19:37,690 --> 02:19:40,130
Ya know he has to go.

5311
02:19:40,131 --> 02:19:40,781
We got it figured out.

5312
02:19:40,781 --> 02:19:41,360
Oh Man.

5313
02:19:41,360 --> 02:19:41,990
Come on man.

5314
02:19:41,990 --> 02:19:42,823
That's entertainment.

5315
02:19:42,860 --> 02:19:44,300
Bravo is 100% right.

5316
02:19:44,990 --> 02:19:46,300
Pretend like you really want the money.

5317
02:19:46,320 --> 02:19:47,900
Said that your your audience.

5318
02:19:48,710 --> 02:19:51,030
You can't pretend I really
want my fucking money.

5319
02:19:51,140 --> 02:19:52,750
This is show Business Brenton.

5320
02:19:53,010 --> 02:19:54,770
I don't bet like that with friends.

5321
02:19:54,800 --> 02:19:56,180
I'll pret a friend 100 bucks.

5322
02:19:56,240 --> 02:19:57,950
I don't mind paying a
friend a hundred bucks,

5323
02:19:58,370 --> 02:20:01,670
but like I don't want
anybody giving me $1,000.

5324
02:20:01,910 --> 02:20:03,170
It feels shit hurt.

5325
02:20:03,230 --> 02:20:04,063
I agree.

5326
02:20:04,910 --> 02:20:08,390
I don't want to like take away from his
kids horse riding lessons or some shit.

5327
02:20:08,630 --> 02:20:12,920
That just seems like that's a
weird thing with like rich dudes.

5328
02:20:13,100 --> 02:20:17,900
Like if you're like a Lorenzo Fertitta
or some sort of a super rich dude type

5329
02:20:17,901 --> 02:20:18,060
kit,

5330
02:20:18,060 --> 02:20:19,310
like if you're going to have a bet,

5331
02:20:19,670 --> 02:20:21,890
that shit has got to be preposterous.

5332
02:20:22,070 --> 02:20:24,770
Please take care heart rate
that just free to care.

5333
02:20:25,010 --> 02:20:27,170
Mark Cuban and Lorenzo Fertitta,

5334
02:20:27,520 --> 02:20:30,380
they get drunk together one night
and they decided let's get down.

5335
02:20:30,381 --> 02:20:31,760
You want to have a bet motherfucker.

5336
02:20:32,010 --> 02:20:34,980
They get crazy and they look
at it like a $50 million bet.

5337
02:20:35,020 --> 02:20:37,000
Right now they're getting
little private jets.

5338
02:20:37,430 --> 02:20:38,263
You know what I'm saying?

5339
02:20:38,450 --> 02:20:39,283
Different level.

5340
02:20:40,070 --> 02:20:40,650
Oh Man.

5341
02:20:40,650 --> 02:20:41,810
Got To have a rich before.

5342
02:20:41,811 --> 02:20:42,680
Holy Shit.

5343
02:20:42,681 --> 02:20:42,960
What's,

5344
02:20:42,960 --> 02:20:46,640
how's the Rondo Lorenzo Party
and these days I to same,

5345
02:20:46,670 --> 02:20:50,720
nothing chose spaceship and he's
just gonna just have a window.

5346
02:20:50,721 --> 02:20:52,030
We're only as dick hangs out.

5347
02:20:52,130 --> 02:20:52,963
Go.

5348
02:20:54,480 --> 02:20:55,850
If you had $1 trillion,

5349
02:20:55,851 --> 02:20:57,650
why don't you just go
everywhere in a helicopter?

5350
02:20:57,651 --> 02:20:58,484
You would just like,

5351
02:20:58,580 --> 02:20:59,361
I don't know man.

5352
02:20:59,361 --> 02:21:00,410
I fuck with traffic.

5353
02:21:00,440 --> 02:21:03,260
Can you imagine the stereo
system he has in his helicopter?

5354
02:21:03,650 --> 02:21:04,570
Holy Shit.

5355
02:21:04,600 --> 02:21:05,840
Changes shows guys.

5356
02:21:06,080 --> 02:21:06,441
Yeah,

5357
02:21:06,441 --> 02:21:08,720
I think there were already so super rich.

5358
02:21:08,721 --> 02:21:09,380
They're just,

5359
02:21:09,380 --> 02:21:09,650
you know,

5360
02:21:09,650 --> 02:21:12,190
more super rich and if I had a guest,

5361
02:21:12,191 --> 02:21:15,710
he's probably going to get into the
football game because he's a big fan of

5362
02:21:15,711 --> 02:21:17,530
football and kids coming to Vegas.

5363
02:21:17,550 --> 02:21:18,920
Kids play football.

5364
02:21:19,520 --> 02:21:20,630
They're talking about that.

5365
02:21:20,660 --> 02:21:21,690
They've already there.

5366
02:21:21,710 --> 02:21:26,710
There was a raider front office looking
at the facilities for practices already

5367
02:21:27,291 --> 02:21:28,124
and then

5368
02:21:29,410 --> 02:21:30,650
the Oakland Raiders will go there.

5369
02:21:30,651 --> 02:21:31,484
Interesting.

5370
02:21:31,580 --> 02:21:35,480
I guarantee that the Fertittas
we'll have some part in that.

5371
02:21:35,600 --> 02:21:36,433
They're great guys.

5372
02:21:36,700 --> 02:21:37,280
They're bro,

5373
02:21:37,280 --> 02:21:39,710
you don't have also hurt and I don't this,

5374
02:21:40,040 --> 02:21:40,851
it could be true.

5375
02:21:40,851 --> 02:21:41,540
I don't know.

5376
02:21:41,540 --> 02:21:44,270
This is from guys dealing
with them since the sale.

5377
02:21:44,330 --> 02:21:49,330
Everyone says Dana is so much better to
deal with on negotiations was from I.

5378
02:21:49,520 --> 02:21:52,820
There's I guess in sales he's just way
cooler to deal with now for whatever

5379
02:21:52,821 --> 02:21:53,330
reason.

5380
02:21:53,330 --> 02:21:54,050
Maybe,

5381
02:21:54,050 --> 02:21:54,770
you know,

5382
02:21:54,770 --> 02:21:55,161
who knows?

5383
02:21:55,161 --> 02:21:56,030
But they say just wait.

5384
02:21:56,210 --> 02:21:56,511
You know,

5385
02:21:56,511 --> 02:21:59,330
not that he wasn't
impossible to deal with.

5386
02:21:59,331 --> 02:21:59,661
I just,

5387
02:21:59,661 --> 02:21:59,901
just,

5388
02:21:59,901 --> 02:22:03,020
his demeanor is completely
different in a positive way.

5389
02:22:03,260 --> 02:22:03,950
Interesting.

5390
02:22:03,950 --> 02:22:04,790
Which was cool to hear.

5391
02:22:04,880 --> 02:22:05,330
Yeah.

5392
02:22:05,330 --> 02:22:06,860
I mean he was already,

5393
02:22:06,980 --> 02:22:08,930
Dan has been super rich for a long time,

5394
02:22:09,170 --> 02:22:12,890
but there's super rich and then there's
like how many hundreds of millions of

5395
02:22:12,890 --> 02:22:14,020
dollars did he make from their Cheddar?

5396
02:22:14,580 --> 02:22:15,630
He hasn't got all of it yet.

5397
02:22:15,631 --> 02:22:15,880
They have to,

5398
02:22:15,880 --> 02:22:16,730
it's like over years,

5399
02:22:16,731 --> 02:22:17,301
but still,

5400
02:22:17,301 --> 02:22:18,134
whatever.

5401
02:22:18,260 --> 02:22:18,710
There's,

5402
02:22:18,710 --> 02:22:22,820
there's like a level up from what I've
heard from people that are going through

5403
02:22:22,821 --> 02:22:23,990
negotiations right now that like,

5404
02:22:23,991 --> 02:22:24,201
dude,

5405
02:22:24,201 --> 02:22:24,391
heat.

5406
02:22:24,391 --> 02:22:25,020
That's crazy.

5407
02:22:25,020 --> 02:22:25,291
He's like,

5408
02:22:25,291 --> 02:22:26,340
he's way better deal with,

5409
02:22:26,590 --> 02:22:27,140
hmm.

5410
02:22:27,140 --> 02:22:27,481
Interesting.

5411
02:22:27,481 --> 02:22:28,314
It's awesome.

5412
02:22:28,620 --> 02:22:29,453
Yeah.

5413
02:22:30,900 --> 02:22:33,330
I'm very curious to see what these guys,

5414
02:22:33,570 --> 02:22:33,811
you know,

5415
02:22:33,811 --> 02:22:34,620
Aria manuals,

5416
02:22:34,620 --> 02:22:37,110
a super savvy entertainment dude,

5417
02:22:37,590 --> 02:22:37,921
you know,

5418
02:22:37,921 --> 02:22:38,580
his uh,

5419
02:22:38,580 --> 02:22:43,580
knowledge about the business is pretty
much unparalleled or at the very least at

5420
02:22:44,041 --> 02:22:48,310
the top of the heap it's him and then ca
he's got some crazy connections the way

5421
02:22:48,330 --> 02:22:51,150
it's going to be interesting to see
what they can pull off because you know,

5422
02:22:51,151 --> 02:22:51,331
the,

5423
02:22:51,331 --> 02:22:53,460
I don't know how long the
deal with Fox goes on,

5424
02:22:53,461 --> 02:22:54,330
but you know,

5425
02:22:54,331 --> 02:22:58,440
other two years I was having
a conversation with Dana
Way back before they were

5426
02:22:58,441 --> 02:22:58,890
uh,

5427
02:22:58,890 --> 02:23:00,090
doing this Fox deal.

5428
02:23:00,210 --> 02:23:03,660
They were talking about buying a network
at one point in time and it was like

5429
02:23:03,661 --> 02:23:08,040
right before the economy collapsed and
if they wound up buying that network,

5430
02:23:08,041 --> 02:23:10,590
who knows where the fucking
spoiled I think's going to happen.

5431
02:23:10,591 --> 02:23:12,480
I think once the Fox deal is up,

5432
02:23:12,750 --> 02:23:13,470
and I may have,

5433
02:23:13,470 --> 02:23:15,060
may not have heard this from some smart,

5434
02:23:15,061 --> 02:23:16,140
smart people involved in it,

5435
02:23:16,800 --> 02:23:18,300
you know how the NFL and NBA,

5436
02:23:18,301 --> 02:23:19,500
it's just not on Fox,

5437
02:23:19,501 --> 02:23:20,430
on CBS,

5438
02:23:20,431 --> 02:23:21,264
NBC,

5439
02:23:21,360 --> 02:23:23,880
they think Espn Fox,

5440
02:23:23,881 --> 02:23:27,060
like they're not going to just
be on one network with just Fox.

5441
02:23:27,120 --> 02:23:29,020
Have the lightweights in the West on NBC,

5442
02:23:29,400 --> 02:23:32,130
you're going to see like
ESPN promoting UFC fights,

5443
02:23:32,131 --> 02:23:32,711
big time.

5444
02:23:32,711 --> 02:23:34,020
Some fights.

5445
02:23:34,021 --> 02:23:37,170
You can see Fox doing it
similar how the NBA and NFL,

5446
02:23:37,171 --> 02:23:38,280
this does make sense.

5447
02:23:38,340 --> 02:23:39,960
They just did a NFL game this week,

5448
02:23:39,961 --> 02:23:42,180
broadcast that on Twitter
live on Thursday night.

5449
02:23:42,210 --> 02:23:46,340
Like it was on the actual app like
on the website or on your phone?

5450
02:23:46,350 --> 02:23:47,400
It was on Twitter.

5451
02:23:47,530 --> 02:23:48,363
I just whoa.

5452
02:23:48,390 --> 02:23:51,270
So he could watch the game on Twitter.

5453
02:23:51,670 --> 02:23:54,450
Trending was trending and then
next to a little live button or,

5454
02:23:54,451 --> 02:23:55,050
whoa.

5455
02:23:55,050 --> 02:23:56,090
That's intense.

5456
02:23:56,670 --> 02:23:57,600
That's intense.

5457
02:23:57,780 --> 02:23:58,770
Do you guys have those things?

5458
02:23:58,771 --> 02:24:02,670
Those are less scans that you put in your
bed and you clip your phone where you

5459
02:24:02,671 --> 02:24:04,200
could just watch your phone like shit.

5460
02:24:04,320 --> 02:24:05,153
None.

5461
02:24:05,370 --> 02:24:08,340
Cause generally if for the
longest time I'd have to hold it,

5462
02:24:08,450 --> 02:24:09,300
kind of set it,

5463
02:24:09,570 --> 02:24:09,751
you know,

5464
02:24:09,751 --> 02:24:11,170
if I want her to watch anything on,

5465
02:24:11,171 --> 02:24:13,260
on my pound now my wife got,

5466
02:24:14,460 --> 02:24:14,761
yeah,

5467
02:24:14,761 --> 02:24:16,110
we're awesome.

5468
02:24:16,110 --> 02:24:19,770
Clip where now I look forward to
getting in bed and just watch a Netflix.

5469
02:24:19,800 --> 02:24:20,820
Why don't you get an iPad?

5470
02:24:20,850 --> 02:24:21,070
Yeah,

5471
02:24:21,070 --> 02:24:21,990
let's just pause on the TV.

5472
02:24:21,991 --> 02:24:22,890
The [inaudible] person.

5473
02:24:22,980 --> 02:24:23,820
I do that too.

5474
02:24:24,030 --> 02:24:24,541
I do that too.

5475
02:24:24,541 --> 02:24:27,960
But it's nice to get in bed cause you
know if you take an iPhone here and you

5476
02:24:27,961 --> 02:24:29,160
hold it to your face like that,

5477
02:24:29,940 --> 02:24:32,700
that's like sitting in the
last row in a movie theater.

5478
02:24:32,850 --> 02:24:33,683
No it's not.

5479
02:24:33,990 --> 02:24:36,240
It's going to fuck your eyes is it is.

5480
02:24:36,270 --> 02:24:36,870
No it's not.

5481
02:24:36,870 --> 02:24:37,561
Yes it is.

5482
02:24:37,561 --> 02:24:38,970
Know your eyes don't move very much.

5483
02:24:39,140 --> 02:24:40,920
When you look into the last
row of a movie theater,

5484
02:24:40,921 --> 02:24:42,330
you looking at this big thing,

5485
02:24:42,570 --> 02:24:43,560
it's still a big thing.

5486
02:24:43,561 --> 02:24:44,750
You're moving your head around.

5487
02:24:44,760 --> 02:24:45,930
Lot of Shit's going on.

5488
02:24:46,200 --> 02:24:47,490
This thing is you got to like,

5489
02:24:47,520 --> 02:24:48,840
oh there's a little thing
right in front of me.

5490
02:24:48,841 --> 02:24:49,830
I got to pretend as big.

5491
02:24:49,890 --> 02:24:50,430
Think about it.

5492
02:24:50,430 --> 02:24:53,820
Think about it next time
when you're lying in bed,

5493
02:24:53,821 --> 02:24:57,240
turn off all the lights and then put
your phone like this close and it's,

5494
02:24:57,420 --> 02:25:01,320
it's like it's the exact same proportions
that of you're sitting in the last row

5495
02:25:01,321 --> 02:25:03,080
in a movie theater kind of,

5496
02:25:03,180 --> 02:25:03,301
Ooh,

5497
02:25:03,301 --> 02:25:03,661
look at this.

5498
02:25:03,661 --> 02:25:05,490
This guy's getting each other's
face right before the fight.

5499
02:25:05,640 --> 02:25:07,740
Well you know they have
those Vr goggle headsets.

5500
02:25:07,741 --> 02:25:08,700
It's actually a phone.

5501
02:25:08,850 --> 02:25:13,290
You slide a Samsung phone until like
this VR goggle and it becomes like a

5502
02:25:13,291 --> 02:25:14,400
virtual reality headset.

5503
02:25:14,401 --> 02:25:17,790
Samsung phones blowing up like crazy.

5504
02:25:18,360 --> 02:25:22,260
Are they note seven how well
that's going to destroy Samsung?

5505
02:25:22,320 --> 02:25:23,170
It's going to destroy them.

5506
02:25:23,280 --> 02:25:24,113
Who's going to hurt?

5507
02:25:25,150 --> 02:25:26,100
They blow up.

5508
02:25:26,230 --> 02:25:26,700
Oh,

5509
02:25:26,700 --> 02:25:27,640
are people dying?

5510
02:25:27,730 --> 02:25:28,030
Dude,

5511
02:25:28,030 --> 02:25:28,270
people,

5512
02:25:28,270 --> 02:25:29,200
they actually blow up.

5513
02:25:29,201 --> 02:25:30,740
I like they're blowing up.

5514
02:25:31,230 --> 02:25:36,230
Narda video taped his house is his house
caught on fire from a fucking Samsung

5515
02:25:37,870 --> 02:25:39,040
Samsung phones blowing up.

5516
02:25:39,040 --> 02:25:39,780
Literally.

5517
02:25:39,780 --> 02:25:40,300
Look at that.

5518
02:25:40,300 --> 02:25:41,133
That's not good.

5519
02:25:41,230 --> 02:25:42,011
Oh No,

5520
02:25:42,011 --> 02:25:42,844
they're done.

5521
02:25:42,890 --> 02:25:45,640
There was where a doc
right now with Samsung.

5522
02:25:45,670 --> 02:25:46,091
Oh he did?

5523
02:25:46,091 --> 02:25:46,970
He dropped radically.

5524
02:25:47,100 --> 02:25:48,550
No more microwaves,

5525
02:25:48,551 --> 02:25:49,160
nothing.

5526
02:25:49,160 --> 02:25:49,320
He,

5527
02:25:49,320 --> 02:25:51,610
there's one where a guy
was in his driveway.

5528
02:25:51,790 --> 02:25:52,623
He had his car,

5529
02:25:52,840 --> 02:25:56,530
a phone charging just
sitting on his console,

5530
02:25:56,770 --> 02:25:57,461
burst into flame,

5531
02:25:57,461 --> 02:25:57,941
came out,

5532
02:25:57,941 --> 02:25:58,810
his dog was barking,

5533
02:25:58,811 --> 02:26:03,640
is fucking cars on fire ablaze in
his driveway from his goddamn phone.

5534
02:26:04,150 --> 02:26:05,320
They videotaped the whole thing,

5535
02:26:05,321 --> 02:26:05,771
so he's like,

5536
02:26:05,771 --> 02:26:06,910
what the fuck is this?

5537
02:26:07,330 --> 02:26:08,670
Your kids have go through your phone.

5538
02:26:08,690 --> 02:26:09,660
I can look at videos and shit.

5539
02:26:09,661 --> 02:26:13,390
You let them watch cartoons and you're
feeling every now and that blew up on

5540
02:26:13,391 --> 02:26:13,571
them.

5541
02:26:13,571 --> 02:26:14,470
Call Man.

5542
02:26:14,500 --> 02:26:14,641
Well,

5543
02:26:14,641 --> 02:26:19,641
six year old boy did apparently get
burned from a afar a phone blown up and is

5544
02:26:19,711 --> 02:26:20,950
calling these phones.

5545
02:26:20,951 --> 02:26:23,010
Can you imagine how many people
got fucked up from him too?

5546
02:26:23,010 --> 02:26:24,670
They'd be called a million phone.

5547
02:26:24,700 --> 02:26:25,780
Holy Shit.

5548
02:26:25,840 --> 02:26:26,890
1 million phones.

5549
02:26:26,920 --> 02:26:29,530
I wonder how many accident can you
find out how many accidents Jamie,

5550
02:26:29,531 --> 02:26:30,280
is that possible?

5551
02:26:30,280 --> 02:26:35,280
Just said there was like 25 26 26
reports of burns and 55 reports.

5552
02:26:37,741 --> 02:26:39,430
The property damage including fires.

5553
02:26:39,580 --> 02:26:41,200
That's a lard for fucking phone.

5554
02:26:41,201 --> 02:26:42,790
I bet that zero for iPhone.

5555
02:26:42,910 --> 02:26:45,250
I've had zero I phones are blowing up.

5556
02:26:45,430 --> 02:26:45,701
Yeah.

5557
02:26:45,701 --> 02:26:49,690
Well this is the first time this has ever
happened with any major manufacturer.

5558
02:26:50,050 --> 02:26:51,100
I've never heard of anything like this.

5559
02:26:51,101 --> 02:26:52,240
Like that thing you were talking about,

5560
02:26:52,470 --> 02:26:53,281
hey look,

5561
02:26:53,281 --> 02:26:55,270
this car is back in the day
like the Pintos and shit.

5562
02:26:55,271 --> 02:26:55,841
We're killing people.

5563
02:26:55,841 --> 02:26:56,050
Right,

5564
02:26:56,050 --> 02:26:57,130
but that was from accidents.

5565
02:26:57,131 --> 02:26:59,650
They get rear ended and the
gas tank was in a bad position.

5566
02:26:59,710 --> 02:27:02,380
How about that thing you were talking
about Elon Musk and came up with a battery

5567
02:27:02,381 --> 02:27:03,940
that store solar energy.

5568
02:27:04,180 --> 02:27:05,120
Will they had those,

5569
02:27:05,710 --> 02:27:06,950
would that be oh,

5570
02:27:06,970 --> 02:27:07,990
you kind of sell the,

5571
02:27:07,991 --> 02:27:09,070
told him all this energy.

5572
02:27:09,100 --> 02:27:09,520
Oh,

5573
02:27:09,520 --> 02:27:10,121
Holy Shit.

5574
02:27:10,121 --> 02:27:13,800
You'd want to put that in the back shed
light on the other side of the backyard.

5575
02:27:13,840 --> 02:27:14,673
It's a good point.

5576
02:27:14,860 --> 02:27:16,750
Blows up like the Samsung phones,

5577
02:27:16,751 --> 02:27:17,410
right?

5578
02:27:17,410 --> 02:27:18,120
Yeah.

5579
02:27:18,120 --> 02:27:18,340
Bill.

5580
02:27:18,340 --> 02:27:19,030
Good point.

5581
02:27:19,030 --> 02:27:22,780
Because think about how small the phone
is and think of how big the battery bank

5582
02:27:22,781 --> 02:27:24,940
must be to power your
fucking j Lo Mansion.

5583
02:27:25,000 --> 02:27:25,131
Oh,

5584
02:27:25,131 --> 02:27:25,600
that's what the,

5585
02:27:25,600 --> 02:27:25,781
hey,

5586
02:27:25,781 --> 02:27:27,170
that's what that the energy companies,

5587
02:27:27,540 --> 02:27:32,540
you can just start false flagging like
houses go solar energy's blowing up

5588
02:27:33,701 --> 02:27:34,534
houses

5589
02:27:35,730 --> 02:27:36,400
and then they'll go like,

5590
02:27:36,400 --> 02:27:36,611
oh,

5591
02:27:36,611 --> 02:27:37,810
we're going to stay on the grid.

5592
02:27:37,990 --> 02:27:38,890
Fuck that son.

5593
02:27:38,891 --> 02:27:39,724
Shit.

5594
02:27:40,490 --> 02:27:41,280
Yeah.

5595
02:27:41,280 --> 02:27:42,113
Why do we go?

5596
02:27:42,200 --> 02:27:43,390
What are you thinking about this site?

5597
02:27:43,460 --> 02:27:44,380
We think about this fight.

5598
02:27:45,010 --> 02:27:47,170
Tremendous amount of shit
talking between these two.

5599
02:27:47,320 --> 02:27:48,310
Wayne's were fairly good.

5600
02:27:49,000 --> 02:27:49,870
It's a really good fight.

5601
02:27:49,871 --> 02:27:50,704
Man.

5602
02:27:51,190 --> 02:27:52,150
Johnson is,

5603
02:27:52,151 --> 02:27:52,380
uh,

5604
02:27:52,380 --> 02:27:52,581
it's,

5605
02:27:52,581 --> 02:27:54,610
it's very interesting because he's,

5606
02:27:55,360 --> 02:27:55,631
he's,

5607
02:27:55,631 --> 02:27:55,990
uh,

5608
02:27:55,990 --> 02:27:59,080
at times like looks real good striking.

5609
02:27:59,200 --> 02:28:00,033
But the question is,

5610
02:28:00,160 --> 02:28:02,010
does he have enough to hang with poor,

5611
02:28:02,011 --> 02:28:02,680
Yay.

5612
02:28:02,680 --> 02:28:02,891
And it,

5613
02:28:02,891 --> 02:28:05,410
does he choose to strike with him
or has he tried to take them down?

5614
02:28:05,830 --> 02:28:06,970
Like what is he going to do here?

5615
02:28:06,971 --> 02:28:08,170
It's going to be really interesting.

5616
02:28:08,430 --> 02:28:12,460
Pull a pretty much has the same
strategy always presses forward and,

5617
02:28:12,490 --> 02:28:13,570
and tries to strike.

5618
02:28:13,680 --> 02:28:15,220
Looks great at this weight class though.

5619
02:28:15,250 --> 02:28:18,160
Jamie just pulled up some shit with
our ready on Tesla for blowing up.

5620
02:28:18,190 --> 02:28:18,550
Right.

5621
02:28:18,550 --> 02:28:19,090
Put that,

5622
02:28:19,090 --> 02:28:20,050
put that back up Jamie.

5623
02:28:20,051 --> 02:28:20,920
There's said tests.

5624
02:28:20,921 --> 02:28:21,130
Look,

5625
02:28:21,130 --> 02:28:26,090
this Tesla's spontaneously catches fire
burns down during test drive in France.

5626
02:28:26,820 --> 02:28:31,100
What they should put that on all they
to put that on CNN all day for a week.

5627
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:32,570
That's it.

5628
02:28:32,570 --> 02:28:33,410
And then that's it.

5629
02:28:33,411 --> 02:28:36,110
That it's so easy to get
rid of good technology.

5630
02:28:36,290 --> 02:28:39,470
Well they had a problem with
Tesla's early on were uh,

5631
02:28:39,530 --> 02:28:43,310
if underground debris or a ground debris,

5632
02:28:43,311 --> 02:28:44,420
like if they rolled over some,

5633
02:28:44,630 --> 02:28:48,040
some rocks or something like that and
it damaged the under carriage that I get

5634
02:28:48,050 --> 02:28:48,950
to have some issues.

5635
02:28:49,130 --> 02:28:51,350
So they fixed that issue
somehow or another,

5636
02:28:51,351 --> 02:28:54,890
they probably like poly urea coated the
bottom of the cars or something is they

5637
02:28:54,891 --> 02:28:56,790
put a titanium shield on the bottom there.

5638
02:28:56,800 --> 02:28:57,633
You got that?

5639
02:28:57,740 --> 02:28:58,390
No ma'am.

5640
02:28:58,390 --> 02:28:58,741
That's it.

5641
02:28:58,741 --> 02:28:59,020
Yeah.

5642
02:28:59,020 --> 02:28:59,330
Yeah.

5643
02:28:59,330 --> 02:29:01,010
It's so easy to get rid of Tesla.

5644
02:29:02,360 --> 02:29:03,193
Yeah.

5645
02:29:03,390 --> 02:29:05,460
This is an interesting fight here man.

5646
02:29:05,490 --> 02:29:08,220
Cause Michael Johnson at one point
in time was looking real good.

5647
02:29:08,250 --> 02:29:09,420
He was climbing that ladder.

5648
02:29:09,450 --> 02:29:10,380
[inaudible] Wind Street,

5649
02:29:10,440 --> 02:29:12,870
but the Nate Diaz fight
set them back quite a bit.

5650
02:29:14,450 --> 02:29:15,830
He got dismantled in that fight.

5651
02:29:15,831 --> 02:29:17,000
Those the best nights ever looked.

5652
02:29:17,001 --> 02:29:18,170
Good luck being that Nate.

5653
02:29:18,500 --> 02:29:18,711
Yeah.

5654
02:29:18,711 --> 02:29:20,150
Nate looked real good man.

5655
02:29:20,390 --> 02:29:23,870
And I was talking to Ludwig about it and
he was talking about how the way Nate

5656
02:29:23,871 --> 02:29:25,100
throws his one too.

5657
02:29:25,400 --> 02:29:29,990
He goes like most people go one to like
the left hand and then the right hand

5658
02:29:29,991 --> 02:29:31,580
comes behind it with Nate.

5659
02:29:31,581 --> 02:29:33,050
They're coming at you at the same time.

5660
02:29:33,051 --> 02:29:33,410
Yeah.

5661
02:29:33,410 --> 02:29:33,950
It's like,

5662
02:29:33,950 --> 02:29:34,960
ah.

5663
02:29:35,300 --> 02:29:35,780
They're like,

5664
02:29:35,780 --> 02:29:37,550
they're coming together.

5665
02:29:37,760 --> 02:29:37,971
Yeah.

5666
02:29:37,971 --> 02:29:38,271
He's like,

5667
02:29:38,271 --> 02:29:39,330
it's a totally different reason.

5668
02:29:40,120 --> 02:29:40,953
Oh,

5669
02:29:43,000 --> 02:29:43,460
hold on.

5670
02:29:43,460 --> 02:29:43,701
Yeah,

5671
02:29:43,701 --> 02:29:44,120
for sure.

5672
02:29:44,120 --> 02:29:46,340
Just goodness.

5673
02:29:46,400 --> 02:29:48,320
Oh my goodness.

5674
02:29:49,070 --> 02:29:50,660
Oh my goodness.

5675
02:29:50,690 --> 02:29:52,700
Henri Hooft and Michael Johnson.

5676
02:29:52,910 --> 02:29:53,661
Michael Johnson.

5677
02:29:53,661 --> 02:29:54,261
Got It done.

5678
02:29:54,261 --> 02:29:55,580
He's doing the gimme my money.

5679
02:29:55,660 --> 02:29:57,340
He was doing the Johnny Man.

5680
02:29:57,540 --> 02:29:58,373
Oh,

5681
02:29:58,530 --> 02:29:58,920
Mike.

5682
02:29:58,920 --> 02:29:59,730
Oh,

5683
02:29:59,730 --> 02:30:00,560
stand over here.

5684
02:30:00,560 --> 02:30:01,393
Oh Wow.

5685
02:30:01,400 --> 02:30:01,611
Well,

5686
02:30:01,611 --> 02:30:01,821
you know,

5687
02:30:01,821 --> 02:30:03,440
you just said fuck you bitch.

5688
02:30:03,470 --> 02:30:03,950
Wow.

5689
02:30:03,950 --> 02:30:04,760
It's a fight.

5690
02:30:04,760 --> 02:30:05,593
He said fuck him.

5691
02:30:05,780 --> 02:30:06,920
Fuck shit talking.

5692
02:30:07,400 --> 02:30:07,731
Wow.

5693
02:30:07,731 --> 02:30:11,720
There must have been some serious
shit talking before this to him.

5694
02:30:12,050 --> 02:30:12,231
Yeah,

5695
02:30:12,231 --> 02:30:12,800
you can't.

5696
02:30:12,800 --> 02:30:13,420
You can't do that.

5697
02:30:13,420 --> 02:30:13,720
Why lunch?

5698
02:30:13,720 --> 02:30:16,160
You guys find out you can't
do that at this point.

5699
02:30:16,190 --> 02:30:17,270
He can remember one tank,

5700
02:30:17,271 --> 02:30:17,980
Abbott fought,

5701
02:30:17,980 --> 02:30:18,620
uh,

5702
02:30:18,620 --> 02:30:21,760
no mark or you flub something now
more than it wasn't drama too.

5703
02:30:21,950 --> 02:30:22,071
No,

5704
02:30:22,071 --> 02:30:22,221
no,

5705
02:30:22,221 --> 02:30:22,371
no,

5706
02:30:22,371 --> 02:30:22,491
no.

5707
02:30:22,491 --> 02:30:23,240
It wasn't him.

5708
02:30:23,240 --> 02:30:24,560
It was a taekwondo guy.

5709
02:30:24,561 --> 02:30:25,191
I forget his name,

5710
02:30:25,191 --> 02:30:30,191
but he thought a taekwondo dude who
fought in the earlier UFC and tank fucked

5711
02:30:30,651 --> 02:30:33,110
him up and he fucked him up too long.

5712
02:30:33,111 --> 02:30:33,944
And the ref try to,

5713
02:30:33,990 --> 02:30:35,840
John Big John McCarthy try to stop it,

5714
02:30:35,841 --> 02:30:37,640
but he hit him like an extra shot.

5715
02:30:38,060 --> 02:30:43,060
And then the guy tried to fight
tank after that for fucking him up.

5716
02:30:43,490 --> 02:30:44,301
It was so weird.

5717
02:30:44,301 --> 02:30:47,320
Like he wanted to fuck him up
for fucking him up to do it.

5718
02:30:47,810 --> 02:30:48,860
They're trying to rally.

5719
02:30:48,860 --> 02:30:50,030
Johnson had just been like,

5720
02:30:50,230 --> 02:30:51,063
dude,

5721
02:30:51,200 --> 02:30:52,250
what's going on in here man?

5722
02:30:52,280 --> 02:30:53,113
Because he's,

5723
02:30:53,370 --> 02:30:54,680
he keeps talking shit.

5724
02:30:54,770 --> 02:30:55,640
We a beautiful,

5725
02:30:55,641 --> 02:30:57,170
like he's totally out of position.

5726
02:30:57,410 --> 02:31:00,770
Dustin [inaudible] feet were totally
out of position and Johnson landed a

5727
02:31:00,771 --> 02:31:01,431
perfect shot.

5728
02:31:01,431 --> 02:31:01,911
Look at the referee,

5729
02:31:01,911 --> 02:31:03,680
lost his shoe first ever.

5730
02:31:03,990 --> 02:31:04,823
First time ever.

5731
02:31:04,910 --> 02:31:05,743
That's what you get.

5732
02:31:06,240 --> 02:31:07,490
Skechers Bam.

5733
02:31:08,690 --> 02:31:11,630
It's interesting from the other angle
because his feet were completely out of

5734
02:31:11,631 --> 02:31:13,430
position and then he cracked him again.

5735
02:31:13,460 --> 02:31:13,850
Damn.

5736
02:31:13,850 --> 02:31:14,671
What could this look at?

5737
02:31:14,671 --> 02:31:15,710
Where it portrays feed are?

5738
02:31:16,020 --> 02:31:16,851
Look at where Atlanta.

5739
02:31:16,851 --> 02:31:17,920
Great defense by John's.

5740
02:31:17,921 --> 02:31:18,350
Yeah.

5741
02:31:18,350 --> 02:31:19,080
Boom.

5742
02:31:19,080 --> 02:31:19,651
Beautiful.

5743
02:31:19,651 --> 02:31:20,130
Bam,

5744
02:31:20,130 --> 02:31:20,550
Bam,

5745
02:31:20,550 --> 02:31:20,881
Bam,

5746
02:31:20,881 --> 02:31:21,714
Bam.

5747
02:31:22,230 --> 02:31:24,780
How cool would it be if he had
a line to the truck from here?

5748
02:31:24,781 --> 02:31:25,590
Like you could talk,

5749
02:31:25,590 --> 02:31:25,910
you know,

5750
02:31:25,910 --> 02:31:27,480
you know when you're working with a show,

5751
02:31:27,720 --> 02:31:28,553
look at that.

5752
02:31:28,560 --> 02:31:29,970
Look at that fucking walk,

5753
02:31:29,971 --> 02:31:30,181
Dude.

5754
02:31:30,181 --> 02:31:31,950
It took security and even Dan,

5755
02:31:31,951 --> 02:31:33,780
Margaret Yankton down the cage was like,

5756
02:31:33,781 --> 02:31:34,021
Dude,

5757
02:31:34,021 --> 02:31:35,010
calm down.

5758
02:31:35,011 --> 02:31:35,910
Even the cut man was like,

5759
02:31:35,911 --> 02:31:36,150
dude,

5760
02:31:36,150 --> 02:31:36,983
chill.

5761
02:31:37,140 --> 02:31:38,490
He's still doing shit.

5762
02:31:38,670 --> 02:31:39,510
He's still doing that.

5763
02:31:39,511 --> 02:31:40,810
Giving my money thing.

5764
02:31:41,460 --> 02:31:42,293
Give me my paper.

5765
02:31:42,810 --> 02:31:43,710
Wow.

5766
02:31:43,770 --> 02:31:44,340
See,

5767
02:31:44,340 --> 02:31:44,581
see,

5768
02:31:44,581 --> 02:31:45,540
this is where I was like,

5769
02:31:45,541 --> 02:31:47,610
why are you cutting away
from the controversy?

5770
02:31:47,970 --> 02:31:48,803
Put It on,

5771
02:31:48,930 --> 02:31:50,670
let's hear what these guys
are saying to each other.

5772
02:31:50,790 --> 02:31:51,021
Yeah.

5773
02:31:51,021 --> 02:31:52,680
I could see what Johnson was saying too.

5774
02:31:52,681 --> 02:31:54,430
I'd much rather meet them up in this.

5775
02:31:54,690 --> 02:31:54,841
Yeah,

5776
02:31:54,841 --> 02:31:55,141
Mike,

5777
02:31:55,141 --> 02:31:55,650
him up.

5778
02:31:55,650 --> 02:31:56,820
I love me some Dan Hardee,

5779
02:31:56,821 --> 02:32:00,000
but I'd much rather see
those two jaw and at it.

5780
02:32:00,180 --> 02:32:00,511
Well,

5781
02:32:00,511 --> 02:32:03,600
you know there's time for that and then
this time for this after that's done.

5782
02:32:03,840 --> 02:32:04,660
It's true.

5783
02:32:04,660 --> 02:32:06,360
It's also time for fucking Burger.

5784
02:32:06,361 --> 02:32:07,980
Can let them jot each other.

5785
02:32:08,010 --> 02:32:09,270
Come on folks.

5786
02:32:09,271 --> 02:32:10,410
Let's see what they said.

5787
02:32:10,800 --> 02:32:11,071
I mean,

5788
02:32:11,071 --> 02:32:14,040
they must have said some awful shit to
each other for Johnson and knock them out

5789
02:32:14,041 --> 02:32:14,910
and still be mad.

5790
02:32:15,990 --> 02:32:19,240
He must've been saying some more awful
shit for security and the cut man be

5791
02:32:19,241 --> 02:32:19,351
like,

5792
02:32:19,351 --> 02:32:19,830
hey,

5793
02:32:19,830 --> 02:32:21,510
let's let's relax a little you one.

5794
02:32:21,511 --> 02:32:22,800
My man pretty amped up.

5795
02:32:22,830 --> 02:32:27,030
It's always weird to me when guys
are mad after the fight you one man,

5796
02:32:27,180 --> 02:32:28,860
you physically beat me up.

5797
02:32:28,861 --> 02:32:29,910
Let's relax.

5798
02:32:29,970 --> 02:32:30,330
Yeah,

5799
02:32:30,330 --> 02:32:31,170
it's always weird to me.

5800
02:32:31,350 --> 02:32:31,771
Wow.

5801
02:32:31,771 --> 02:32:34,800
So that's a setback and a
half or pour your that high.

5802
02:32:34,801 --> 02:32:36,180
You get that high?

5803
02:32:36,181 --> 02:32:36,690
Like I just,

5804
02:32:36,690 --> 02:32:37,920
I'm a fucking conquer now.

5805
02:32:37,921 --> 02:32:39,720
I don't want to take any shit now.

5806
02:32:39,721 --> 02:32:41,250
You just want to fuck more people up.

5807
02:32:41,251 --> 02:32:41,930
Right.

5808
02:32:41,930 --> 02:32:44,970
I could only imagine because I've
never ever fucked anybody up.

5809
02:32:46,050 --> 02:32:47,040
I could never imagine.

5810
02:32:47,430 --> 02:32:48,860
All I do is as a,

5811
02:32:49,500 --> 02:32:51,210
have you had an animosity Joe Schilling?

5812
02:32:51,211 --> 02:32:51,511
You have,

5813
02:32:51,511 --> 02:32:51,810
you,

5814
02:32:51,810 --> 02:32:52,561
you beat a guy.

5815
02:32:52,561 --> 02:32:55,260
Let's say there's bad blood
before you guys fight.

5816
02:32:55,380 --> 02:32:56,310
Do you carry on,

5817
02:32:56,340 --> 02:33:00,480
do you hold that bad blood in the
locker room kind of get it out?

5818
02:33:00,481 --> 02:33:01,150
I think so,

5819
02:33:01,150 --> 02:33:01,983
yeah.

5820
02:33:02,820 --> 02:33:03,390
Usually.

5821
02:33:03,390 --> 02:33:07,200
Have you ever fought a guy where it's
just bad mad shit talking like it was like

5822
02:33:07,830 --> 02:33:08,610
out of control

5823
02:33:08,610 --> 02:33:09,510
on Twitter and shit?

5824
02:33:10,100 --> 02:33:10,560
Uh,

5825
02:33:10,560 --> 02:33:10,860
yeah.

5826
02:33:10,860 --> 02:33:13,310
I've had like a couple like beef,

5827
02:33:13,311 --> 02:33:14,970
so like that where we
had like multiple fights.

5828
02:33:14,971 --> 02:33:16,290
Me and Levin had three fights.

5829
02:33:16,291 --> 02:33:17,150
Me and uh,

5830
02:33:17,330 --> 02:33:18,560
I followed Simon Martin.

5831
02:33:18,960 --> 02:33:20,940
Twitter's telling each
other to fuck off and chat.

5832
02:33:21,060 --> 02:33:21,750
Uh,

5833
02:33:21,750 --> 02:33:22,231
not really.

5834
02:33:22,231 --> 02:33:25,140
I don't think Twitter was one of the
interviews and went back and forth space.

5835
02:33:25,570 --> 02:33:30,220
The lemon one was weird because Levin
pulled out of your fight and then he

5836
02:33:30,221 --> 02:33:30,851
fought Simon.

5837
02:33:30,851 --> 02:33:32,110
Mark is after that and,

5838
02:33:32,150 --> 02:33:34,150
and just stop fighting
at one point in time.

5839
02:33:34,151 --> 02:33:34,361
Right?

5840
02:33:34,361 --> 02:33:34,770
Like what,

5841
02:33:34,770 --> 02:33:37,230
what happened in that fight with

5842
02:33:37,240 --> 02:33:38,830
the assignment and 11,

5843
02:33:38,890 --> 02:33:40,570
I was there and I still
don't know what happened.

5844
02:33:40,600 --> 02:33:41,433
Uh,

5845
02:33:41,620 --> 02:33:42,453
I think uh,

5846
02:33:44,820 --> 02:33:45,461
can you got a,

5847
02:33:45,461 --> 02:33:45,761
a,

5848
02:33:45,761 --> 02:33:49,090
a warning or something for
hold for holding are I think,

5849
02:33:49,091 --> 02:33:49,840
uh,

5850
02:33:49,840 --> 02:33:50,740
he got an eight count.

5851
02:33:50,741 --> 02:33:55,390
I think they fell between the ropes
and the and 11 and get back in the room

5852
02:33:55,590 --> 02:33:56,530
during fast enough.

5853
02:33:56,531 --> 02:33:58,630
So they give him a standing
eight count and he got pissed.

5854
02:33:59,690 --> 02:33:59,920
Yeah.

5855
02:33:59,920 --> 02:34:01,450
He just quit like halfway
through the fight.

5856
02:34:01,570 --> 02:34:02,380
Just got up,

5857
02:34:02,380 --> 02:34:03,220
walked out of the ring,

5858
02:34:03,221 --> 02:34:03,580
quit.

5859
02:34:03,580 --> 02:34:04,690
And he hasn't really fought since.

5860
02:34:04,691 --> 02:34:05,170
How's he?

5861
02:34:05,170 --> 02:34:05,381
No,

5862
02:34:05,381 --> 02:34:06,214
I don't think so.

5863
02:34:06,680 --> 02:34:08,950
You were saying that you didn't
think that he wanted to find anymore?

5864
02:34:09,160 --> 02:34:11,020
It was like one of those
things like the reason why,

5865
02:34:11,380 --> 02:34:11,651
yeah.

5866
02:34:11,651 --> 02:34:13,300
I can't imagine anybody like I lost,

5867
02:34:13,301 --> 02:34:15,640
like I had respect for him
even though we had like,

5868
02:34:15,700 --> 02:34:16,151
he was like,

5869
02:34:16,151 --> 02:34:16,990
we're rivalry,

5870
02:34:17,110 --> 02:34:17,440
but,

5871
02:34:17,440 --> 02:34:18,241
and then when he did that,

5872
02:34:18,241 --> 02:34:18,970
I just,

5873
02:34:18,970 --> 02:34:22,270
you're like the champion and you're
representing kickboxing and representing

5874
02:34:22,271 --> 02:34:24,790
your country and representing
all of this like shit.

5875
02:34:24,820 --> 02:34:26,980
And you quit because the,

5876
02:34:27,100 --> 02:34:27,610
you know,

5877
02:34:27,610 --> 02:34:28,080
you took

5878
02:34:28,080 --> 02:34:29,030
ball home and the,

5879
02:34:29,031 --> 02:34:30,600
and then gave up your world title.

5880
02:34:30,610 --> 02:34:31,443
It was ridiculous.

5881
02:34:32,490 --> 02:34:33,323
You know what I mean?

5882
02:34:34,050 --> 02:34:36,840
He got out of the ring
defending his title and quit.

5883
02:34:37,920 --> 02:34:38,753
That was just weird.

5884
02:34:38,800 --> 02:34:39,633
He never,

5885
02:34:40,040 --> 02:34:41,070
you don't see that,

5886
02:34:41,130 --> 02:34:41,963
you know,

5887
02:34:42,550 --> 02:34:44,610
be a shouldn't if Johnson talk shit here,

5888
02:34:45,550 --> 02:34:47,520
I think he's calmed down because
they just hugged each other.

5889
02:34:47,850 --> 02:34:48,683
You know?

5890
02:34:48,780 --> 02:34:49,620
Let's hear what he's saying.

5891
02:34:55,090 --> 02:34:55,781
Pay me Baby.

5892
02:34:55,781 --> 02:34:56,614
What's up?

5893
02:34:56,620 --> 02:34:57,453
Wow.

5894
02:34:58,120 --> 02:34:59,830
See everybody's going WWE.

5895
02:35:00,340 --> 02:35:01,000
Well,

5896
02:35:01,000 --> 02:35:01,990
but pay me what's up.

5897
02:35:01,991 --> 02:35:04,860
Maybe if it's a contract
crank repass changing,

5898
02:35:07,220 --> 02:35:08,053
dude,

5899
02:35:13,640 --> 02:35:15,070
this is a beautiful combination.

5900
02:35:15,080 --> 02:35:17,360
Look at this crank bang.

5901
02:35:20,280 --> 02:35:21,113
Hmm.

5902
02:35:21,860 --> 02:35:22,130
Don't,

5903
02:35:22,130 --> 02:35:22,760
don't make Nate,

5904
02:35:22,760 --> 02:35:23,960
Nate Diaz get in shape now.

5905
02:35:24,030 --> 02:35:25,610
I just a division one wrestler as well.

5906
02:35:25,790 --> 02:35:26,240
Yeah,

5907
02:35:26,240 --> 02:35:27,073
very good wrestler.

5908
02:35:27,170 --> 02:35:28,910
It's just weird how the
referee lost his shoe.

5909
02:35:28,940 --> 02:35:29,870
Do you tie your shoes?

5910
02:35:30,050 --> 02:35:30,883
What's going on buddy?

5911
02:35:30,890 --> 02:35:31,710
They're sketchers.

5912
02:35:31,710 --> 02:35:33,500
Have you ever lost your
shoe in a scramble?

5913
02:35:34,050 --> 02:35:35,070
There's cancers.

5914
02:35:35,330 --> 02:35:36,630
Maybe they should be wearing wrestling to

5915
02:35:38,930 --> 02:35:40,070
the Chandler.

5916
02:35:40,071 --> 02:35:41,090
Gave him a flat tire.

5917
02:35:41,091 --> 02:35:42,350
If you watch that back,

5918
02:35:42,380 --> 02:35:45,260
no one should be sketchers
in a street fight.

5919
02:35:45,470 --> 02:35:47,150
You mean pour Yay or Johnson.

5920
02:35:47,210 --> 02:35:47,900
I'm just kidding.

5921
02:35:47,900 --> 02:35:48,430
Oh,

5922
02:35:48,430 --> 02:35:48,920
look at this.

5923
02:35:48,920 --> 02:35:49,760
Boom.

5924
02:35:51,290 --> 02:35:52,470
How did he lose the shoe?

5925
02:35:52,670 --> 02:35:53,503
Look,

5926
02:35:53,740 --> 02:35:54,950
he'd already laid out right there.

5927
02:35:55,700 --> 02:35:56,600
That's a bad angle.

5928
02:35:56,810 --> 02:35:57,620
I think.

5929
02:35:57,620 --> 02:35:58,490
Damn a flat.

5930
02:35:58,520 --> 02:35:59,061
A flat tire.

5931
02:35:59,061 --> 02:35:59,780
That's Dan.

5932
02:35:59,780 --> 02:36:00,430
You know what it was?

5933
02:36:00,430 --> 02:36:03,500
She was probably too small because
dance feeder so fucking big.

5934
02:36:03,830 --> 02:36:06,710
You probably didn't have any shoes that
fit him because Dan Merkel Jada's a

5935
02:36:06,711 --> 02:36:07,250
giant,

5936
02:36:07,250 --> 02:36:08,083
giant man.

5937
02:36:09,200 --> 02:36:12,040
18 shoe couldn't find whether
the mall and he's a fuck boy.

5938
02:36:12,080 --> 02:36:14,570
Give me the 16 he looks like he should
be wearing those new balance cause

5939
02:36:14,571 --> 02:36:15,650
they're extra white foot.

5940
02:36:16,550 --> 02:36:17,091
You know what I'm saying?

5941
02:36:17,091 --> 02:36:19,520
Like people white feet
have those new balances,

5942
02:36:19,521 --> 02:36:20,920
those weird old new balances.

5943
02:36:20,930 --> 02:36:22,150
Maybe put the 16 on,

5944
02:36:22,160 --> 02:36:22,431
but he said,

5945
02:36:22,431 --> 02:36:23,264
I just won't tie him.

5946
02:36:23,620 --> 02:36:24,710
It's not going to go away.

5947
02:36:27,750 --> 02:36:29,450
And you know that that's
the worst that could happen.

5948
02:36:29,510 --> 02:36:34,070
Function for the Ufcu that SAP Spanish,

5949
02:36:34,580 --> 02:36:36,020
you can hear the Spanish commentary.

5950
02:36:36,730 --> 02:36:38,240
What if the UFC came to you and said,

5951
02:36:38,241 --> 02:36:43,241
we want to add an option to listen to
the bike can penguin and they see the

5952
02:36:43,251 --> 02:36:45,770
problem with that is then we would
have to guarantee we're going to do it.

5953
02:36:46,460 --> 02:36:47,660
We don't always want to do it.

5954
02:36:47,720 --> 02:36:48,020
Yeah.

5955
02:36:48,020 --> 02:36:50,660
You know like sometimes where I would
tell like the beautiful thing about the

5956
02:36:50,661 --> 02:36:53,180
fight and pain is where we're independent.

5957
02:36:53,420 --> 02:36:53,781
You know,

5958
02:36:53,781 --> 02:36:56,240
we get together and we really
wouldn't be doing this anyway.

5959
02:36:56,260 --> 02:36:58,460
We'd be $2 billion.

5960
02:36:58,670 --> 02:36:59,503
Okay,

5961
02:37:00,020 --> 02:37:00,710
get what I gotta do.

5962
02:37:00,710 --> 02:37:03,440
But you'd also have to want to
hang out with Lorenzo and Italy.

5963
02:37:03,740 --> 02:37:04,620
I want to get a yacht.

5964
02:37:04,621 --> 02:37:06,140
It'd be like what's hot is that?

5965
02:37:06,520 --> 02:37:07,251
Is that the end?

5966
02:37:07,251 --> 02:37:07,940
Is the yacht,

5967
02:37:07,940 --> 02:37:10,700
is that still the yard in the
helicopter and the private jet?

5968
02:37:10,701 --> 02:37:11,750
That's the last shit

5969
02:37:15,230 --> 02:37:15,980
island is

5970
02:37:15,980 --> 02:37:18,880
the last islands where you land
your yacht or your helicopter.

5971
02:37:18,881 --> 02:37:19,720
But by the time,

5972
02:37:20,510 --> 02:37:21,590
by the time you have an island,

5973
02:37:21,591 --> 02:37:24,050
you already have a yacht in
a helicopter ride in a jet.

5974
02:37:24,860 --> 02:37:27,200
It's like you're a white
belt at being a billionaire,

5975
02:37:27,230 --> 02:37:27,421
right?

5976
02:37:27,421 --> 02:37:27,920
Yeah.

5977
02:37:27,920 --> 02:37:28,090
It's like,

5978
02:37:28,090 --> 02:37:28,351
okay,

5979
02:37:28,351 --> 02:37:28,820
you got to yet.

5980
02:37:28,820 --> 02:37:29,241
That's cute.

5981
02:37:29,241 --> 02:37:31,940
Standard Uber Boat.

5982
02:37:35,000 --> 02:37:35,541
Oh Dude.

5983
02:37:35,541 --> 02:37:36,374
He got lit up.

5984
02:37:36,500 --> 02:37:37,400
God Damn,

5985
02:37:37,401 --> 02:37:39,080
it was delicious stoppage.

5986
02:37:40,190 --> 02:37:41,090
That was ferocious.

5987
02:37:41,120 --> 02:37:43,040
What's the latest on jet packs?

5988
02:37:43,130 --> 02:37:46,370
I mean joke in 2000 about how,

5989
02:37:46,720 --> 02:37:47,480
why the fuck?

5990
02:37:47,480 --> 02:37:52,480
Cause they had jet packs in the 70s
that was in 2016 they had jet packs on

5991
02:37:52,970 --> 02:37:53,803
chips.

5992
02:37:53,840 --> 02:37:58,190
I don't know if you're over 40 you
might remember chips with Erik Estrada.

5993
02:37:58,520 --> 02:37:59,353
I love chips.

5994
02:38:00,170 --> 02:38:02,780
They're fucking a jet packs back then.

5995
02:38:02,930 --> 02:38:04,050
You telling me that was real.

5996
02:38:04,220 --> 02:38:05,360
She should be mastered.

5997
02:38:05,361 --> 02:38:05,661
Yes.

5998
02:38:05,661 --> 02:38:06,500
They've had jet packs.

5999
02:38:06,710 --> 02:38:07,190
You could,

6000
02:38:07,190 --> 02:38:08,023
you could.

6001
02:38:13,740 --> 02:38:14,110
Hey,

6002
02:38:14,110 --> 02:38:15,080
if they weren't real.

6003
02:38:15,260 --> 02:38:16,400
I believe it.

6004
02:38:17,740 --> 02:38:20,690
I believe I was in Denver with my,

6005
02:38:20,760 --> 02:38:24,240
my boy Willie from KBP AI low six,

6006
02:38:24,241 --> 02:38:27,710
seven and willy took me
into the parking lot.

6007
02:38:27,711 --> 02:38:28,550
They had a,

6008
02:38:28,551 --> 02:38:28,781
a,

6009
02:38:28,781 --> 02:38:32,210
a show that they did live from the
parking lot where a dude fluid jetpack.

6010
02:38:32,570 --> 02:38:34,010
So jetpacks do exist.

6011
02:38:34,011 --> 02:38:37,580
But the dude who fluid
had two ACL braces on.

6012
02:38:37,940 --> 02:38:38,271
I said,

6013
02:38:38,271 --> 02:38:38,620
what?

6014
02:38:38,620 --> 02:38:39,021
I go,

6015
02:38:39,021 --> 02:38:40,380
what's up with the ACL brace?

6016
02:38:40,381 --> 02:38:40,790
Does he like,

6017
02:38:40,790 --> 02:38:41,061
dude,

6018
02:38:41,061 --> 02:38:43,900
I fucking crashed the thing so
many times for my legs apart.

6019
02:38:44,150 --> 02:38:44,540
He goes,

6020
02:38:44,540 --> 02:38:45,373
at this point,

6021
02:38:45,440 --> 02:38:47,780
I'm not even going to
bother getting it fixed.

6022
02:38:47,870 --> 02:38:48,051
Yeah,

6023
02:38:48,051 --> 02:38:48,884
they have them,

6024
02:38:48,920 --> 02:38:51,650
but that this guy had this guy,

6025
02:38:51,680 --> 02:38:52,513
this is a,

6026
02:38:52,520 --> 02:38:55,250
this is a much newer
prototype with Willie.

6027
02:38:55,290 --> 02:38:55,760
Um,

6028
02:38:55,760 --> 02:39:00,720
and the gentleman who we saw
this was like 2000 so good looks.

6029
02:39:00,770 --> 02:39:03,140
So back then they could only do it.

6030
02:39:03,140 --> 02:39:06,230
He said they could only
fly for 30 seconds.

6031
02:39:06,380 --> 02:39:10,520
So what would happen is he would go 15
seconds up and then it would take about,

6032
02:39:10,820 --> 02:39:12,290
he really wanted to go down.

6033
02:39:12,291 --> 02:39:12,561
He said,

6034
02:39:12,561 --> 02:39:15,230
I'd like to land in about five seconds.

6035
02:39:15,380 --> 02:39:15,711
He's like,

6036
02:39:15,711 --> 02:39:16,250
because I don't,

6037
02:39:16,250 --> 02:39:18,380
I've needed a buffer at like 30 seconds.

6038
02:39:18,381 --> 02:39:19,430
You're basically out of juice.

6039
02:39:19,431 --> 02:39:20,061
That's awesome.

6040
02:39:20,061 --> 02:39:21,110
Pleat wastes of time.

6041
02:39:21,500 --> 02:39:22,010
Hey,

6042
02:39:22,010 --> 02:39:23,090
but for now,

6043
02:39:23,120 --> 02:39:26,870
see the thing is virtual
reality that for 50 years,

6044
02:39:27,250 --> 02:39:31,610
the thing is virtual reality
used to be a waste of time too,

6045
02:39:31,640 --> 02:39:34,760
until the computers and
the technology caught up.

6046
02:39:34,761 --> 02:39:37,610
Now they have virtual reality
that will freak you the fuck out,

6047
02:39:37,611 --> 02:39:38,180
man.

6048
02:39:38,180 --> 02:39:40,370
There's a crazy virtual
reality you showed me.

6049
02:39:40,970 --> 02:39:41,190
No,

6050
02:39:41,190 --> 02:39:41,420
no,

6051
02:39:41,420 --> 02:39:41,571
no,

6052
02:39:41,571 --> 02:39:42,404
you never did it.

6053
02:39:42,520 --> 02:39:43,161
He never did it.

6054
02:39:43,161 --> 02:39:44,180
I didn't show you anything.

6055
02:39:44,810 --> 02:39:44,961
No,

6056
02:39:44,961 --> 02:39:45,410
I didn't.

6057
02:39:45,410 --> 02:39:45,531
No,

6058
02:39:45,531 --> 02:39:48,200
I didn't show you never put a goggle on.

6059
02:39:48,200 --> 02:39:50,090
You never went and saw the graph and no,

6060
02:39:50,091 --> 02:39:50,241
no,

6061
02:39:50,241 --> 02:39:50,391
no,

6062
02:39:50,391 --> 02:39:50,541
no,

6063
02:39:50,541 --> 02:39:50,661
no,

6064
02:39:50,661 --> 02:39:50,820
no,

6065
02:39:50,820 --> 02:39:51,001
no,

6066
02:39:51,001 --> 02:39:51,141
no,

6067
02:39:51,141 --> 02:39:51,300
no.

6068
02:39:51,300 --> 02:39:51,460
You,

6069
02:39:51,460 --> 02:39:52,940
you're seeing it in two dimensions.

6070
02:39:53,150 --> 02:39:53,983
It doesn't mean anything.

6071
02:39:54,110 --> 02:39:56,990
When you put that goggles on and
you're looking around in this world,

6072
02:39:57,020 --> 02:39:59,600
even if the graphics
aren't perfect day freak,

6073
02:39:59,601 --> 02:40:00,560
you the fuck out.

6074
02:40:01,930 --> 02:40:02,763
They get weird.

6075
02:40:02,900 --> 02:40:05,150
You're walking a wire in a canyon.

6076
02:40:05,520 --> 02:40:06,321
It's and you're like,

6077
02:40:06,321 --> 02:40:07,154
Holy Shit,

6078
02:40:07,280 --> 02:40:08,210
I'm scared of heights.

6079
02:40:08,570 --> 02:40:09,950
Even in this fucking,

6080
02:40:09,951 --> 02:40:12,530
I was in some hallway
where there's a boxing.

6081
02:40:12,531 --> 02:40:13,480
What kind of Shit?

6082
02:40:13,750 --> 02:40:14,640
Here's a boxing one.

6083
02:40:14,641 --> 02:40:14,870
Yeah,

6084
02:40:14,870 --> 02:40:15,040
we,

6085
02:40:15,040 --> 02:40:15,721
you boxes guy.

6086
02:40:15,721 --> 02:40:18,840
It's weird because you hold these handles.

6087
02:40:19,010 --> 02:40:22,770
You got to hold them like this for your
fist to look like this and the game.

6088
02:40:22,950 --> 02:40:23,940
It's very strange.

6089
02:40:24,120 --> 02:40:26,850
So like you looks like you're hitting
the guy like this with your hands,

6090
02:40:26,940 --> 02:40:28,530
but you're really doing this in the air.

6091
02:40:28,620 --> 02:40:33,620
It's so it's not 100% like
boxing technique but you
could change that mean you

6092
02:40:33,951 --> 02:40:37,200
could definitely change it
to you're putting something
in your hand and wherever

6093
02:40:37,201 --> 02:40:38,190
position your hand is in,

6094
02:40:38,280 --> 02:40:40,680
that's the position the gloves would
be in and then it would feel a lot more

6095
02:40:40,681 --> 02:40:41,100
natural.

6096
02:40:41,100 --> 02:40:41,730
But it's very,

6097
02:40:41,730 --> 02:40:42,570
this is what it looks like.

6098
02:40:42,780 --> 02:40:44,490
It's very rudimentary right now.

6099
02:40:44,580 --> 02:40:49,580
But for as far as like movement and as
far as like teaching someone how to avoid

6100
02:40:50,521 --> 02:40:51,720
punches and counter,

6101
02:40:51,750 --> 02:40:54,660
you don't feel anything
when you hit him but you,

6102
02:40:54,720 --> 02:40:58,350
you do have to move
correctly in order to hit it.

6103
02:40:58,351 --> 02:41:00,060
What happens if you throw
the right technique,

6104
02:41:00,061 --> 02:41:00,690
the punches just,

6105
02:41:00,690 --> 02:41:01,670
it doesn't snap with it.

6106
02:41:01,710 --> 02:41:03,570
You should have happens if you do throw,

6107
02:41:03,571 --> 02:41:06,820
it doesn't matter because it's not
based on how the punch actually what,

6108
02:41:06,821 --> 02:41:08,490
what position that glove is when it lands.

6109
02:41:08,640 --> 02:41:11,750
It's based on whether
the glove lands to do it.

6110
02:41:11,751 --> 02:41:16,140
Like with like some kind of helmet that
electroids connect to your brain where

6111
02:41:16,170 --> 02:41:17,870
you could kind of feel when you yes.

6112
02:41:17,950 --> 02:41:18,281
Yeah,

6113
02:41:18,281 --> 02:41:18,660
yeah.

6114
02:41:18,660 --> 02:41:20,570
And get zapped a little zap.

6115
02:41:20,880 --> 02:41:22,140
But then that

6116
02:41:24,220 --> 02:41:27,930
that gives you a Parkinson's
quicker than actual trauma.

6117
02:41:27,960 --> 02:41:28,081
Well,

6118
02:41:28,081 --> 02:41:28,980
here's what happened.

6119
02:41:29,130 --> 02:41:33,330
The dude in the video game caught me
with a punch and that when they catch it,

6120
02:41:33,331 --> 02:41:34,920
you see a flash that's kind of,

6121
02:41:34,970 --> 02:41:37,800
and it gives you the same feeling
that happens when you get,

6122
02:41:37,950 --> 02:41:38,160
you're like,

6123
02:41:38,160 --> 02:41:38,640
oh shit,

6124
02:41:38,640 --> 02:41:39,030
I better,

6125
02:41:39,030 --> 02:41:40,010
I better wait flash.

6126
02:41:40,050 --> 02:41:40,321
Yeah.

6127
02:41:40,321 --> 02:41:41,071
But it gives you that,

6128
02:41:41,071 --> 02:41:41,551
oh shit,

6129
02:41:41,551 --> 02:41:42,384
we're in trouble.

6130
02:41:42,660 --> 02:41:46,380
It gives you like that same little
weird endorphin rush if you get actually

6131
02:41:46,381 --> 02:41:47,214
punched in the face.

6132
02:41:47,520 --> 02:41:48,390
It's very interesting.

6133
02:41:49,290 --> 02:41:50,123
Very interesting.

6134
02:41:50,190 --> 02:41:55,140
So what I'm thinking is if
someone develops a program
where they take a guy like

6135
02:41:55,141 --> 02:42:00,141
you and Joe Schilling does his
kickboxing techniques and you literally,

6136
02:42:01,350 --> 02:42:03,660
I mean it's going to have
to be like one or two more,

6137
02:42:03,960 --> 02:42:04,793
uh,

6138
02:42:05,210 --> 02:42:07,710
like versions of this improvements,

6139
02:42:07,950 --> 02:42:10,950
but it's going to get to a point where
it's virtual and to the point where it's

6140
02:42:10,951 --> 02:42:12,270
super high resolution.

6141
02:42:12,420 --> 02:42:16,830
So they could hire a guy like you
to throw kicks and punches and in a,

6142
02:42:16,920 --> 02:42:21,060
in a computer simulation where all of
your different kicks and punches are all

6143
02:42:21,061 --> 02:42:24,570
programmed in there along
with like patterns that you
might use and someone can

6144
02:42:24,571 --> 02:42:28,350
actually practice fighting you without
fighting you like your opponent.

6145
02:42:28,380 --> 02:42:29,110
Yeah,

6146
02:42:29,110 --> 02:42:29,800
that's crazy.

6147
02:42:29,800 --> 02:42:29,951
Kind.

6148
02:42:29,951 --> 02:42:31,170
Kinda like you would,

6149
02:42:31,171 --> 02:42:34,320
you would get used to
seeing you across the cage.

6150
02:42:34,470 --> 02:42:36,810
That'd be illegal to steal
someone's fucking moves.

6151
02:42:37,330 --> 02:42:41,730
Imagine you sold your
fucking program to the enemy.

6152
02:42:41,790 --> 02:42:45,300
Like imagine your elder or training where
you need a partner that you're doing

6153
02:42:45,301 --> 02:42:45,451
that.

6154
02:42:45,451 --> 02:42:45,840
It's like,

6155
02:42:45,840 --> 02:42:46,290
yeah,

6156
02:42:46,290 --> 02:42:46,470
I,

6157
02:42:46,470 --> 02:42:48,760
you're basically doing I
training at that point of some,

6158
02:42:48,790 --> 02:42:53,790
a drill where you're doing actual real
time had moment where that shit you could

6159
02:42:54,361 --> 02:42:54,571
do it.

6160
02:42:54,571 --> 02:42:57,240
I'm telling you the couch
laying in bed right now.

6161
02:42:57,990 --> 02:42:59,190
It's attached to a cord.

6162
02:42:59,191 --> 02:43:01,710
So it would be weird for
like spinning things.

6163
02:43:01,711 --> 02:43:05,370
It'd be weird if you're trying to throw
spinning elbows or spinning kicks or

6164
02:43:05,400 --> 02:43:06,510
move too much.

6165
02:43:06,660 --> 02:43:06,901
You know,

6166
02:43:06,901 --> 02:43:08,010
if you had too much footwork,

6167
02:43:08,011 --> 02:43:09,180
you might get tangled up in this.

6168
02:43:09,300 --> 02:43:11,410
But how long for this
motherfucker's wireless.

6169
02:43:11,680 --> 02:43:12,940
And once that thing's wireless,

6170
02:43:12,941 --> 02:43:16,420
then you just wear a helmet and you're
basically in some enter the dragon room

6171
02:43:16,630 --> 02:43:19,390
because you set these things
up and we're Dunkin had it,

6172
02:43:19,391 --> 02:43:20,440
he had it in his office,

6173
02:43:20,441 --> 02:43:22,300
which is essentially like
the same size of this room.

6174
02:43:22,450 --> 02:43:25,780
You've got a camera up there and a camera
up there and it makes a grid on the

6175
02:43:25,781 --> 02:43:26,201
ground.

6176
02:43:26,201 --> 02:43:27,900
And that grid on the ground is the,

6177
02:43:27,901 --> 02:43:28,960
the battlefield.

6178
02:43:29,110 --> 02:43:30,490
A grid is where you do cut out.

6179
02:43:30,520 --> 02:43:34,510
Like there's an archery game and that
grid represents a tech castle and these

6180
02:43:34,511 --> 02:43:37,330
invading armies are coming and you're
shooting at them with bows and arrows?

6181
02:43:38,760 --> 02:43:39,593
Dude,

6182
02:43:39,630 --> 02:43:40,710
it's already in his backpack.

6183
02:43:40,711 --> 02:43:41,850
So it's off of uh,

6184
02:43:41,970 --> 02:43:43,080
like big wires.

6185
02:43:43,110 --> 02:43:46,950
It's not fully wireless Xbox on
it that looks wireless to me.

6186
02:43:47,010 --> 02:43:47,820
Is that a,

6187
02:43:47,820 --> 02:43:48,361
what is a,

6188
02:43:48,361 --> 02:43:50,470
which version is this James
is to say it's the vibe.

6189
02:43:50,471 --> 02:43:53,450
It's the same thing you used
the whole computer is in her,

6190
02:43:53,520 --> 02:43:54,353
on her back.

6191
02:43:55,050 --> 02:43:56,430
Is that an try them?

6192
02:43:57,120 --> 02:43:59,040
It's a company like Msi I believe,

6193
02:43:59,041 --> 02:44:00,640
which is a for sale Joe or

6194
02:44:02,750 --> 02:44:05,460
Dunkin's maybe Dunkin
got like a prototype.

6195
02:44:05,461 --> 02:44:05,581
No,

6196
02:44:05,581 --> 02:44:06,750
I mean for him to try it out.

6197
02:44:06,940 --> 02:44:07,310
Yeah.

6198
02:44:07,310 --> 02:44:07,590
Eddie,

6199
02:44:07,590 --> 02:44:09,420
you could try it out at Dunkin's
house now you can buy them.

6200
02:44:10,640 --> 02:44:11,120
Yeah.

6201
02:44:11,120 --> 02:44:11,930
You don't need that.

6202
02:44:11,930 --> 02:44:14,680
There's not a place like
where you can go like a,

6203
02:44:14,700 --> 02:44:16,820
like an Internet cafe where
that a bunch of different,

6204
02:44:16,850 --> 02:44:18,600
now they put you in a room,

6205
02:44:18,750 --> 02:44:19,800
eight bucks an hour.

6206
02:44:20,540 --> 02:44:21,960
It's going to knock yourself out.

6207
02:44:21,990 --> 02:44:22,823
It's going to happen.

6208
02:44:23,070 --> 02:44:26,130
I'm telling you this technology is
going to change the fucking world.

6209
02:44:26,340 --> 02:44:27,720
There's no arcades anymore.

6210
02:44:27,721 --> 02:44:28,120
Right?

6211
02:44:28,120 --> 02:44:28,953
Like they didn't get,

6212
02:44:29,710 --> 02:44:31,110
let's try going to castle park.

6213
02:44:32,040 --> 02:44:35,910
I take my son there like
every once or twice a week.

6214
02:44:35,940 --> 02:44:36,571
Castle Park,

6215
02:44:36,571 --> 02:44:37,404
we were there today.

6216
02:44:38,220 --> 02:44:39,600
I shit the pat take care still.

6217
02:44:40,590 --> 02:44:41,820
As long as there's kids,

6218
02:44:42,030 --> 02:44:45,060
there's going to be video games in
arcades cause that on the weekends,

6219
02:44:45,061 --> 02:44:46,650
Catlin and miniature golf,

6220
02:44:46,950 --> 02:44:48,290
they don't even have to
take care of the fuck.

6221
02:44:48,291 --> 02:44:49,260
I'm going to miniature golf.

6222
02:44:49,261 --> 02:44:50,094
Make sense?

6223
02:44:50,100 --> 02:44:51,630
It's packed on the weekends,

6224
02:44:51,660 --> 02:44:51,901
man.

6225
02:44:51,901 --> 02:44:52,141
Holy.

6226
02:44:52,141 --> 02:44:53,850
And during the summer you got kids.

6227
02:44:53,851 --> 02:44:57,180
You want to take them to fun places
and arcades are killing it though.

6228
02:44:57,690 --> 02:44:58,650
There's arcades,

6229
02:44:59,220 --> 02:45:01,530
arcades and do it right like those
Dave and busters are everywhere.

6230
02:45:01,531 --> 02:45:02,580
They're all across the country.

6231
02:45:02,850 --> 02:45:03,760
They have all kinds of kids.

6232
02:45:03,790 --> 02:45:04,950
Didn't busters counseling,

6233
02:45:05,350 --> 02:45:06,570
all kinds of crazy games.

6234
02:45:06,630 --> 02:45:07,441
Anything for kids.

6235
02:45:07,441 --> 02:45:10,670
I get the big blockbuster movies
for kids all the Goddamn time.

6236
02:45:10,710 --> 02:45:15,420
Everything's for kids and music for kids

02:45:27,500 --> 02:45:29,260
These are speakers that neither.

6245
02:45:31,160 --> 02:45:32,370

6251
02:45:46,210 --> 02:45:48,520
He though you'd take him there
to ride the bikes and then,

6252
02:45:48,720 --> 02:45:49,900
and then eventually one of the,

6253
02:45:50,080 --> 02:45:50,480

6254
02:45:50,480 --> 02:45:53,370

of three times we'll say,

6255
02:45:53,371 --> 02:45:57,130

these bikes like the shining,

6256
02:45:57,131 --> 02:45:57,964

This one now it's like one big ass place.

6262
02:46:09,080 --> 02:46:10,400
The toys are very similar.

6263
02:46:10,401 --> 02:46:10,990
When I was there.

6264
02:46:10,990 --> 02:46:11,920
It's still a teenager,

6265
02:46:11,970 --> 02:46:12,803
Ninja Turtles,

6266
02:46:12,830 --> 02:46:13,581
GI Joes,

6267
02:46:13,581 --> 02:46:14,660
action figures,

6268
02:46:14,750 --> 02:46:15,770
micro machines,

6269
02:46:15,771 --> 02:46:17,960

6275
02:46:22,880 --> 02:46:23,240
No,

6276
02:46:23,240 --> 02:46:25,220
that's going to happen for sure.

6277
02:46:25,221 --> 02:46:25,660
It's going to happen.

02:46:27,771 --> 02:46:28,341
Can I see the video?

6281
02:46:28,341 --> 02:46:29,360
You're going to be watching a video.

6282
02:46:29,540 --> 02:46:30,590
He's going to want to see it too.

6283
02:46:30,591 --> 02:46:31,071
What are you going to say?

6284
02:46:31,071 --> 02:46:31,610
No,

6285
02:46:31,610 --> 02:46:32,391
you're going to be sitting there.

6286
02:46:32,391 --> 02:46:34,130
You guys going to be
looking at videos together,

6287
02:46:34,131 --> 02:46:37,730
music videos and shed on your phone

6288
02:46:37,731 --> 02:46:39,050
account on your phone.

6289
02:46:39,290 --> 02:46:40,123
It's going to have

6290
02:46:43,130 --> 02:46:44,000
so he,

6291
02:46:44,001 --> 02:46:44,780
it's not,

6292
02:46:44,780 --> 02:46:45,471
nothing's easy,

6293
02:46:45,471 --> 02:46:49,250
but having a business where
kids come for entertainment,

6294
02:46:49,400 --> 02:46:50,010
man,

6295
02:46:50,010 --> 02:46:50,843
that's like,

6296
02:46:51,020 --> 02:46:52,040
once you figured that out,

6297
02:46:52,041 --> 02:46:52,874
that's forever.

6298
02:46:53,240 --> 02:46:54,580
Like there's a place called uh,

6299
02:46:54,770 --> 02:46:55,050
uh,

6300
02:46:55,050 --> 02:46:55,410
Biz,

6301
02:46:55,410 --> 02:46:57,920
a dizzy bees and a Valencia.

6302
02:46:58,070 --> 02:47:02,720
It's a giant place with these tubes
and slides and the kids go nuts there.

6303
02:47:02,721 --> 02:47:03,351
Billy B's,

6304
02:47:03,351 --> 02:47:05,210
if you've heard of Billy B's in Valencia,

6305
02:47:05,450 --> 02:47:07,880
gigantic to place to park.

6306
02:47:08,060 --> 02:47:08,893
Where all these crazy,

6307
02:47:08,900 --> 02:47:09,950
it's fun for adults.

6308
02:47:10,040 --> 02:47:10,561
I know when they,

6309
02:47:10,561 --> 02:47:11,810
when my kid was sliding down,

6310
02:47:11,811 --> 02:47:12,070
it's,

6311
02:47:12,070 --> 02:47:12,470
it's,

6312
02:47:12,470 --> 02:47:13,130
it's awesome.

6313
02:47:13,130 --> 02:47:13,881
What are you showing us up?

6314
02:47:13,881 --> 02:47:16,460
Virtual reality check man.

6315
02:47:16,461 --> 02:47:17,180
Dubai.

6316
02:47:17,180 --> 02:47:19,520
These guys are flying
on these self propelled.

6317
02:47:19,521 --> 02:47:21,260
I think they have to live from a plane.

6318
02:47:21,330 --> 02:47:22,163
Whoa.

6319
02:47:22,790 --> 02:47:23,623
That shit.

6320
02:47:23,630 --> 02:47:26,480
It's like a how long
they go for holy Shit.

6321
02:47:28,480 --> 02:47:29,420
That's amazing.

6322
02:47:29,450 --> 02:47:29,841
They said,

6323
02:47:29,841 --> 02:47:30,980
fuck your 30 seconds.

6324
02:47:31,010 --> 02:47:32,720
I wonder how long that the tank last.

6325
02:47:32,721 --> 02:47:34,100
Holy Shit.

6326
02:47:34,101 --> 02:47:35,840
These guys are human planes.

6327
02:47:36,100 --> 02:47:36,933
Birds.

6328
02:47:37,100 --> 02:47:37,671
Oh my God.

6329
02:47:37,671 --> 02:47:38,504
That's it.

6330
02:47:43,150 --> 02:47:43,983
That's

6331
02:47:45,630 --> 02:47:46,820
like in the future.

6332
02:47:46,821 --> 02:47:48,970
This is what it's gonna
look like and working on it.

6333
02:47:48,980 --> 02:47:49,910
We need that investment.

6334
02:47:49,911 --> 02:47:50,890
They're trying to invest in.

6335
02:47:51,020 --> 02:47:52,580
They show them right when all the sky,

6336
02:47:52,581 --> 02:47:52,761
no,

6337
02:47:52,761 --> 02:47:53,001
Eddie,

6338
02:47:53,001 --> 02:47:53,834
it's real.

6339
02:47:53,870 --> 02:47:55,060
This is 100% real.

6340
02:47:55,070 --> 02:47:55,940
I've already seen this.

6341
02:47:56,090 --> 02:47:56,221
Oh,

6342
02:47:56,221 --> 02:47:57,054
you've seen it.

6343
02:47:57,120 --> 02:47:57,680
This is real.

6344
02:47:57,680 --> 02:47:59,460
Look how close they are to the Gen Ed.

6345
02:47:59,600 --> 02:48:00,430
So bad.

6346
02:48:00,430 --> 02:48:01,220
So dangerous.

6347
02:48:01,220 --> 02:48:02,060
What if it catches fire?

6348
02:48:02,061 --> 02:48:07,061
Like a Samsung phone just burns your dick
30 only catches your deck on fire and

6349
02:48:07,911 --> 02:48:10,010
then it goes out your ditch.

6350
02:48:11,210 --> 02:48:13,190
That takes suicide
bombing the whole fucking

6351
02:48:14,930 --> 02:48:15,980
undo those straps.

6352
02:48:16,000 --> 02:48:16,833
And I'd be like,

6353
02:48:17,450 --> 02:48:18,290
we're done here.

6354
02:48:18,291 --> 02:48:20,060
We're just going to go
30,000 feet and out.

6355
02:48:20,090 --> 02:48:20,451
Fuck,

6356
02:48:20,451 --> 02:48:21,590
you're flying squirrel suit.

6357
02:48:22,030 --> 02:48:23,030
It's just not my way.

6358
02:48:23,330 --> 02:48:24,590
Didn't red bull have one?

6359
02:48:24,591 --> 02:48:25,640
What they the first to do it,

6360
02:48:25,641 --> 02:48:27,260
but it wasn't a jet propelled.

6361
02:48:27,261 --> 02:48:28,160
It was like a suit.

6362
02:48:28,220 --> 02:48:29,310
That's still Paris show.

6363
02:48:29,750 --> 02:48:30,740
That's so crazy.

6364
02:48:30,741 --> 02:48:31,580
One false move.

6365
02:48:31,581 --> 02:48:35,520
And they're dead as fuck
for shut up chem trails.

6366
02:48:36,370 --> 02:48:36,631
Yeah.

6367
02:48:36,631 --> 02:48:38,180
There Kim Cherry on the fuck out of Dubai.

6368
02:48:40,010 --> 02:48:40,910
My friend Andy,

6369
02:48:40,911 --> 02:48:41,391
he does.

6370
02:48:41,391 --> 02:48:41,840
Uh,

6371
02:48:41,840 --> 02:48:44,370
he does those wingsuits see that's in,

6372
02:48:44,530 --> 02:48:47,130
which is even crazier because he
doesn't even have an engine behind it.

6373
02:48:47,131 --> 02:48:47,990
And they're like right there.

6374
02:48:47,991 --> 02:48:48,824
Like right.

6375
02:48:50,510 --> 02:48:51,321
Have you ever seen him crashed?

6376
02:48:51,321 --> 02:48:52,154
One of those things.

6377
02:48:52,400 --> 02:48:54,440
I saw the video of one guy from a Gopro,

6378
02:48:54,441 --> 02:48:56,480
like from his point of view
where he hits the ground,

6379
02:48:56,870 --> 02:48:59,300
he just timed it shitty
in a fuck your night up.

6380
02:48:59,350 --> 02:49:02,980
And I'm always going a hundred something
miles an hour to I hit the person.

6381
02:49:03,720 --> 02:49:04,553
You can't,

6382
02:49:04,700 --> 02:49:05,220
sorry.

6383
02:49:05,220 --> 02:49:06,890
You can't see the aftermath of it.

6384
02:49:06,891 --> 02:49:07,770
You can just see him hit.

6385
02:49:07,771 --> 02:49:08,130
But people

6386
02:49:08,130 --> 02:49:08,611
watching it.

6387
02:49:08,611 --> 02:49:09,030
Yeah,

6388
02:49:09,030 --> 02:49:09,500
pull it up.

6389
02:49:09,500 --> 02:49:09,660
Yeah.

6390
02:49:09,660 --> 02:49:10,770
I'd love to see a Jamie.

6391
02:49:11,280 --> 02:49:12,570
Let's send this fucker with that.

6392
02:49:13,770 --> 02:49:15,770
I knew the brand side.

6393
02:49:16,230 --> 02:49:16,681
What is it?

6394
02:49:16,681 --> 02:49:18,450
It's people love fucking thrills,

6395
02:49:18,451 --> 02:49:18,631
man.

6396
02:49:18,631 --> 02:49:18,901
I mean,

6397
02:49:18,901 --> 02:49:19,980
why do we like this uh,

6398
02:49:20,010 --> 02:49:22,230
Johnson [inaudible]
because we love thrills,

6399
02:49:22,500 --> 02:49:22,741
right?

6400
02:49:22,741 --> 02:49:23,700
We'll have craziness.

6401
02:49:23,701 --> 02:49:28,170
How Jesus and people love watching things
and they love doing thrilling things

6402
02:49:28,171 --> 02:49:29,940
and some people just have to,

6403
02:49:30,270 --> 02:49:32,280
they just have to go so far to get there.

6404
02:49:32,281 --> 02:49:35,760
Dick car coming and he's coming in at
gorgeous a bunch of people on a bridge and

6405
02:49:35,761 --> 02:49:37,920
he was trying to be a
little bit of a hot dog,

6406
02:49:37,921 --> 02:49:40,340
they said and trying to go really
closer than he was supposed to come.

6407
02:49:40,341 --> 02:49:41,040
God Dog.

6408
02:49:41,040 --> 02:49:43,800
Like one guy went under the bridge and
one guy went over and he's the guy that

6409
02:49:43,801 --> 02:49:44,634
was going over.

6410
02:49:45,000 --> 02:49:46,290
I had a friend who was into this,

6411
02:49:46,291 --> 02:49:47,080
hold on a second.

6412
02:49:47,080 --> 02:49:47,913
Hold on.

6413
02:49:48,030 --> 02:49:49,340
Hello.

6414
02:49:50,940 --> 02:49:51,421
Oh my God.

6415
02:49:51,421 --> 02:49:52,440
He just hit the bridge.

6416
02:49:55,580 --> 02:49:57,410
That sound is him hitting
the bridge called,

6417
02:49:57,450 --> 02:49:58,283
I'll play that back.

6418
02:49:58,810 --> 02:49:59,910
And they see that other guy,

6419
02:49:59,911 --> 02:50:01,380
there's another guy that was behind him.

6420
02:50:01,440 --> 02:50:01,561
Yeah.

6421
02:50:01,561 --> 02:50:02,760
He wouldn't play that sound again.

6422
02:50:02,780 --> 02:50:03,613
Hold on a second.

6423
02:50:06,510 --> 02:50:07,260
That's came

6424
02:50:07,260 --> 02:50:08,093
son.

6425
02:50:08,350 --> 02:50:09,250
Whoa.

6426
02:50:10,840 --> 02:50:11,673
But then one more time.

6427
02:50:12,700 --> 02:50:13,480
What's that sound?

6428
02:50:13,480 --> 02:50:14,313
Listen to the sound.

6429
02:50:14,730 --> 02:50:15,563
Oh,

6430
02:50:17,910 --> 02:50:19,160
they knew the guy saying,

6431
02:50:19,170 --> 02:50:19,680
oh shit.

6432
02:50:19,680 --> 02:50:21,910
Before I knew it was blacks.

6433
02:50:21,950 --> 02:50:23,130
It was training for this.

6434
02:50:23,131 --> 02:50:26,190
You gotta do so many
skydiving jumps to do this.

6435
02:50:26,460 --> 02:50:28,110
And by the time he was,

6436
02:50:28,370 --> 02:50:29,203
uh,

6437
02:50:29,910 --> 02:50:31,380
like a qualified to do it,

6438
02:50:31,410 --> 02:50:32,730
like a base jump show,

6439
02:50:32,731 --> 02:50:36,180
many of his group have died
that he decided to back out.

6440
02:50:36,181 --> 02:50:36,391
It's like,

6441
02:50:36,391 --> 02:50:37,250
too many people are dying.

6442
02:50:37,640 --> 02:50:39,390
These guys die all the Goddamn time.

6443
02:50:40,080 --> 02:50:40,913
These guys,

6444
02:50:42,470 --> 02:50:43,800
one wrong move and you're dead.

6445
02:50:44,430 --> 02:50:45,263
It's over.

6446
02:50:46,290 --> 02:50:48,150
Oh Shit.

6447
02:50:52,410 --> 02:50:53,490
Fuck man.

6448
02:50:54,270 --> 02:50:55,260
Holy Shit.

6449
02:50:55,350 --> 02:50:55,680
God.

6450
02:50:55,680 --> 02:50:55,980
Where's?

6451
02:50:55,980 --> 02:50:57,740
He just can't have any for steaks.

6452
02:50:57,810 --> 02:50:59,190
Oh look what it did to the bar.

6453
02:51:00,550 --> 02:51:01,050
That's a,

6454
02:51:01,050 --> 02:51:01,950
that's a fish.

6455
02:51:02,100 --> 02:51:02,940
I don't know

6456
02:51:04,770 --> 02:51:05,490
who's that.

6457
02:51:05,490 --> 02:51:06,323
That's something else.

6458
02:51:07,590 --> 02:51:10,620
Go down a wound rabbit hole on youtube.

6459
02:51:10,621 --> 02:51:11,280
Like,

6460
02:51:11,280 --> 02:51:12,360
you know when I was a kid,

6461
02:51:12,361 --> 02:51:14,610
you had to work to get a
copy of faces of death.

6462
02:51:14,790 --> 02:51:16,050
You had to actually go out.

6463
02:51:16,050 --> 02:51:16,890
You got to seek it.

6464
02:51:16,891 --> 02:51:19,350
You got to go to that weird
area of the video store.

6465
02:51:19,560 --> 02:51:20,250
You had a rented,

6466
02:51:20,250 --> 02:51:21,990
you gotta hope somebody else
hadn't rented it before.

6467
02:51:21,991 --> 02:51:26,850
You any little fucking kid whose parents
aren't paying attention can go on

6468
02:51:26,851 --> 02:51:30,960
youtube now and watch dudes bounce off
of cliffs and buildings get run over by

6469
02:51:30,961 --> 02:51:31,501
trucks.

6470
02:51:31,501 --> 02:51:33,000
Isis car headwinds.

6471
02:51:33,690 --> 02:51:34,980
If you too doesn't catch it.

6472
02:51:35,010 --> 02:51:35,530
Those things,

6473
02:51:35,530 --> 02:51:38,550
they stay on for a while and keep
fucking high school kids are probably the

6474
02:51:38,551 --> 02:51:39,600
first to find those things.

6475
02:51:39,601 --> 02:51:40,560
You got a smart little fucker.

6476
02:51:40,561 --> 02:51:43,680
He's on that under web
looking at all sorts of shit.

6477
02:51:43,710 --> 02:51:44,251
God,

6478
02:51:44,251 --> 02:51:44,491
man.

6479
02:51:44,491 --> 02:51:48,750
What the input inputs that someone's
mind under and the dark web.

6480
02:51:48,810 --> 02:51:51,800
That seems like such a trap.

6481
02:51:51,970 --> 02:51:52,200
Like,

6482
02:51:52,200 --> 02:51:53,033
yeah,

6483
02:51:53,160 --> 02:51:54,270
it's an under web.

6484
02:51:54,390 --> 02:51:56,860
You could do all the
black lips are really sad.

6485
02:51:57,390 --> 02:51:57,661
Yeah,

6486
02:51:57,661 --> 02:51:59,370
but it just seems like it's a trap.

6487
02:51:59,550 --> 02:52:00,060
The trap.

6488
02:52:00,060 --> 02:52:02,280
Well then you can't do
all sorts of crazy shit.

6489
02:52:02,281 --> 02:52:03,240
They've arrested people.

6490
02:52:03,540 --> 02:52:06,310
The guy who created a that a website.

6491
02:52:06,720 --> 02:52:07,553
What was the website?

6492
02:52:08,050 --> 02:52:08,920
Silkroad yeah,

6493
02:52:09,310 --> 02:52:10,060
he uh,

6494
02:52:10,060 --> 02:52:11,500
he's actually in jail for life.

6495
02:52:11,620 --> 02:52:13,180
For facilities out.

6496
02:52:13,240 --> 02:52:13,660
Not as I say,

6497
02:52:13,660 --> 02:52:14,160
it's not out there.

6498
02:52:14,160 --> 02:52:15,610
It's pretty interesting doc.

6499
02:52:15,760 --> 02:52:17,650
I don't know if it's a documentary
is the way you want to word it,

6500
02:52:17,651 --> 02:52:19,330
but on Viceland show,

6501
02:52:19,360 --> 02:52:20,290
I think it's a,

6502
02:52:20,850 --> 02:52:21,730
I can't remember the name of it,

6503
02:52:21,731 --> 02:52:23,830
but they take a guy onto the dark web.

6504
02:52:23,860 --> 02:52:24,100
They,

6505
02:52:24,100 --> 02:52:24,641
they show you like,

6506
02:52:24,641 --> 02:52:25,720
this is going on a website,

6507
02:52:25,721 --> 02:52:26,680
here's the Ebay,

6508
02:52:26,920 --> 02:52:28,570
here's how you can buy stuff with bitcoin.

6509
02:52:28,630 --> 02:52:28,961
Oh look,

6510
02:52:28,961 --> 02:52:29,794
there's heroin.

6511
02:52:29,890 --> 02:52:30,570
Where do you get,

6512
02:52:30,570 --> 02:52:31,403
like how do you trade my,

6513
02:52:31,470 --> 02:52:34,930
I wonder if that's not been
tightened up because of the trial.

6514
02:52:35,230 --> 02:52:38,380
The trial was really crazy because
it turns out that the DEA agents,

6515
02:52:38,410 --> 02:52:39,880
the people who are investigating them,

6516
02:52:39,881 --> 02:52:41,830
wind up stealing the bitcoin money.

6517
02:52:42,040 --> 02:52:45,970
So the investigating guys wound up
stealing hundreds of thousands of dollars.

6518
02:52:46,180 --> 02:52:49,360
And then the guy who created the whole
thing still wound up going to jail.

6519
02:52:49,450 --> 02:52:53,830
So there was obviously some fuckery and
shenanigans and real corruption going

6520
02:52:53,831 --> 02:52:54,460
on.

6521
02:52:54,460 --> 02:52:55,110
And uh,

6522
02:52:55,110 --> 02:52:56,530
this dude's in jail for life.

6523
02:52:56,680 --> 02:52:58,090
He's in jail for life and they,

6524
02:52:58,120 --> 02:52:58,953
but they said that,

6525
02:52:59,500 --> 02:52:59,680
see,

6526
02:52:59,680 --> 02:53:00,790
I don't really know what he did,

6527
02:53:00,791 --> 02:53:03,220
but I think they said
that he was trying to,

6528
02:53:03,330 --> 02:53:03,730
uh,

6529
02:53:03,730 --> 02:53:07,900
get someone murdered or that was
like one of the possibilities,

6530
02:53:07,901 --> 02:53:08,470
right?

6531
02:53:08,470 --> 02:53:09,890
That someone had a,

6532
02:53:09,910 --> 02:53:13,990
suggested they murder somebody and
he was trying to set something up.

6533
02:53:14,070 --> 02:53:15,010
Well that makes sense.

6534
02:53:15,030 --> 02:53:15,750
Can Be ordered.

6535
02:53:15,750 --> 02:53:17,680
Killings of people were
watching that movie that,

6536
02:53:17,681 --> 02:53:17,980
uh,

6537
02:53:17,980 --> 02:53:20,390
Alex wintered made that he was in bed.

6538
02:53:20,500 --> 02:53:21,490
You can learn a lot about it.

6539
02:53:21,610 --> 02:53:21,830
Yeah,

6540
02:53:21,830 --> 02:53:22,930
he didn't believe it.

6541
02:53:22,960 --> 02:53:24,070
Alex didn't believe it.

6542
02:53:24,100 --> 02:53:25,480
There's an interesting documentary.

6543
02:53:25,481 --> 02:53:27,460
I've watched the documentary
before Alex came in.

6544
02:53:28,010 --> 02:53:28,870
He didn't believe it.

6545
02:53:28,871 --> 02:53:30,550
But the reality is he doesn't know.

6546
02:53:30,850 --> 02:53:31,061
You know,

6547
02:53:31,061 --> 02:53:31,420
you don't,

6548
02:53:31,420 --> 02:53:34,330
you don't really know what a guy did
or didn't do unless you were there.

6549
02:53:34,360 --> 02:53:35,193
It's just,

6550
02:53:35,260 --> 02:53:35,670
I don't,

6551
02:53:35,670 --> 02:53:35,950
I mean,

6552
02:53:35,950 --> 02:53:37,420
we know the cops were liars though.

6553
02:53:37,450 --> 02:53:38,380
They were stealing money.

6554
02:53:38,620 --> 02:53:43,480
Like they're very cops that were in charge
of the case were stealing money from

6555
02:53:43,481 --> 02:53:43,840
the soup.

6556
02:53:43,840 --> 02:53:44,551
He counts.

6557
02:53:44,551 --> 02:53:45,970
So the whole thing is so crazy.

6558
02:53:46,000 --> 02:53:48,850
Jamie is anonymous.

6559
02:53:49,120 --> 02:53:50,230
Like how do they still work?

6560
02:53:50,300 --> 02:53:51,430
How does that work?

6561
02:53:51,610 --> 02:53:53,530
What does do you know
is anybody can be in,

6562
02:53:53,770 --> 02:53:54,191
you don't,

6563
02:53:54,191 --> 02:53:54,431
you know,

6564
02:53:54,431 --> 02:53:56,200
there's no like fucking meetings.

6565
02:53:56,230 --> 02:53:57,700
It's just a bunch of people online.

6566
02:53:57,701 --> 02:53:58,660
They're tired of bullshit.

6567
02:53:58,661 --> 02:53:59,494
Smart paper.

6568
02:53:59,900 --> 02:54:01,280
That really smart people.

6569
02:54:01,290 --> 02:54:01,840
Yeah.

6570
02:54:01,840 --> 02:54:03,340
How do you know it's not fake?

6571
02:54:03,341 --> 02:54:03,820
Like how come?

6572
02:54:03,820 --> 02:54:04,810
Cause they're all wearing math.

6573
02:54:04,811 --> 02:54:06,430
How do you know people
aren't putting fake?

6574
02:54:06,550 --> 02:54:07,420
How do you know the fake?

6575
02:54:07,421 --> 02:54:07,511
Well,

6576
02:54:07,511 --> 02:54:08,344
here's the thing.

6577
02:54:08,640 --> 02:54:09,473
Can Be,

6578
02:54:09,740 --> 02:54:11,230
anybody can be there.

6579
02:54:11,231 --> 02:54:11,530
I mean,

6580
02:54:11,530 --> 02:54:12,251
I don't know.

6581
02:54:12,251 --> 02:54:12,431
I mean,

6582
02:54:12,431 --> 02:54:12,881
how would you,

6583
02:54:12,881 --> 02:54:16,630
I would have to talk to someone who's
legitimately in anonymous to get the full

6584
02:54:16,631 --> 02:54:17,230
details.

6585
02:54:17,230 --> 02:54:18,880
Still going strong.

6586
02:54:18,881 --> 02:54:20,500
And they're still fighting crime,

6587
02:54:20,501 --> 02:54:21,130
right?

6588
02:54:21,130 --> 02:54:22,030
They definitely do.

6589
02:54:22,031 --> 02:54:24,130
They definitely catch people
that have done fucked up shit.

6590
02:54:24,160 --> 02:54:24,910
Oh yeah,

6591
02:54:24,910 --> 02:54:25,743
there was a girl,

6592
02:54:25,750 --> 02:54:26,081
well,

6593
02:54:26,081 --> 02:54:29,380
I remember one story about a girl
who was throwing puppies in a,

6594
02:54:29,381 --> 02:54:30,101
in a river.

6595
02:54:30,101 --> 02:54:30,881
I remember that Shit.

6596
02:54:30,881 --> 02:54:32,020
And they found her and they,

6597
02:54:32,021 --> 02:54:34,300
they'd doxed her information and then,

6598
02:54:34,380 --> 02:54:34,630
you know,

6599
02:54:34,630 --> 02:54:34,870
they've,

6600
02:54:34,870 --> 02:54:35,950
they've done some things,

6601
02:54:35,951 --> 02:54:36,131
you know,

6602
02:54:36,131 --> 02:54:40,510
they've closed down and hacked into
databases and companies are doing shady

6603
02:54:40,511 --> 02:54:41,344
shit.

6604
02:54:41,410 --> 02:54:42,221
What's going on in here?

6605
02:54:42,221 --> 02:54:42,351
New.

6606
02:54:42,351 --> 02:54:46,180
But a Ra did a podcast with a couple
of guys down where in anonymous or they

6607
02:54:46,181 --> 02:54:47,260
claim to be an anonymous.

6608
02:54:47,261 --> 02:54:48,310
So if you want to find that out,

6609
02:54:48,311 --> 02:54:52,540
you can check out skeptic tank 79 and
[inaudible] talked with a couple of guys.

6610
02:54:52,580 --> 02:54:53,830
I'm just confused as how,

6611
02:54:53,890 --> 02:54:56,430
how it's organized and excellent.

6612
02:54:56,760 --> 02:54:57,330
Is there,

6613
02:54:57,330 --> 02:54:58,450
is there an anonymous,

6614
02:54:58,930 --> 02:54:59,830
uh,

6615
02:54:59,860 --> 02:55:00,760
like an official,

6616
02:55:00,790 --> 02:55:01,860
there's an sure.

6617
02:55:01,940 --> 02:55:06,770
Twitter like nick who runs down enough
the cabbie because then like people

6618
02:55:06,771 --> 02:55:07,550
wouldn't know who they are.

6619
02:55:07,550 --> 02:55:08,950
I got to say before I forget,

6620
02:55:09,020 --> 02:55:09,180
uh,

6621
02:55:09,180 --> 02:55:09,841
Ari Shaffir,

6622
02:55:09,841 --> 02:55:13,310
his latest podcast is with Henry Rollins.

6623
02:55:13,311 --> 02:55:14,690
Those who wander are not on,

6624
02:55:14,691 --> 02:55:16,670
not all those who wander are lost.

6625
02:55:16,671 --> 02:55:19,460
It's fucking amazing that
Henry Rollins guy's crazy.

6626
02:55:19,461 --> 02:55:20,294
He's crazy.

6627
02:55:20,560 --> 02:55:21,530
It goes all over the world.

6628
02:55:21,531 --> 02:55:21,801
No,

6629
02:55:21,801 --> 02:55:22,630
he's amazing.

6630
02:55:22,630 --> 02:55:23,190
Amazing.

6631
02:55:23,190 --> 02:55:23,840
I,

6632
02:55:23,840 --> 02:55:27,560
I'm buying for a total new
found appreciation for him
after listening to him on

6633
02:55:27,561 --> 02:55:28,281
that podcast.

6634
02:55:28,281 --> 02:55:29,480
He told me his work ethic,

6635
02:55:29,481 --> 02:55:32,120
we work with the same guys for our live
shows and they were telling us about

6636
02:55:32,300 --> 02:55:34,760
Henry Rollins and his work
ethic on the live shows.

6637
02:55:34,761 --> 02:55:35,481
It's insane,

6638
02:55:35,481 --> 02:55:35,840
man.

6639
02:55:35,840 --> 02:55:36,673
I can only imagine.

6640
02:55:36,950 --> 02:55:38,870
He goes to these weird places,

6641
02:55:38,871 --> 02:55:40,100
he picks a spot in the world,

6642
02:55:40,220 --> 02:55:45,010
travels there and spends like a month
there and just brings a typewriter or or

6643
02:55:45,020 --> 02:55:50,020
rather a a a camera and maybe a laptop
and do you know his clothes and shit and

6644
02:55:50,031 --> 02:55:53,840
just lives with these people and
just just goes to like Kuala Lampur.

6645
02:55:53,870 --> 02:55:54,111
Okay,

6646
02:55:54,111 --> 02:55:54,944
let's try that place.

6647
02:55:55,140 --> 02:55:56,330
Don't it goes by himself,

6648
02:55:56,510 --> 02:55:57,470
goes and hangs out,

6649
02:55:57,980 --> 02:56:01,460
takes a photos during the day and
at nighttime write stories about it.

6650
02:56:02,010 --> 02:56:04,190
You know when he writes stories for
a bunch of different publications,

6651
02:56:04,191 --> 02:56:07,010
I don't want to give away any more of it
because it's just awesome podcasts and

6652
02:56:07,011 --> 02:56:07,700
string dude.

6653
02:56:07,700 --> 02:56:08,090
Yeah.

6654
02:56:08,090 --> 02:56:09,230
Are ran into him.

6655
02:56:09,470 --> 02:56:13,810
I think Ra was in Stockholm and he was
doing standup and Henry Rollins was,

6656
02:56:13,811 --> 02:56:15,290
they were doing something
else and they met up.

6657
02:56:15,980 --> 02:56:17,770
So interesting guy.

6658
02:56:18,050 --> 02:56:18,480
Yeah.

6659
02:56:18,480 --> 02:56:19,910
Well even,

6660
02:56:19,920 --> 02:56:20,460
I mean I,

6661
02:56:20,460 --> 02:56:23,780
I always thought he was very smart and
interesting and very passionate about a

6662
02:56:23,781 --> 02:56:24,231
lot of things,

6663
02:56:24,231 --> 02:56:28,370
but hearing them on Ari's podcast gave
me a whole different appreciation for

6664
02:56:28,371 --> 02:56:28,461
them.

6665
02:56:28,461 --> 02:56:29,870
I feel like you guys would connect.

6666
02:56:30,200 --> 02:56:31,670
Maybe it's certain things.

6667
02:56:31,910 --> 02:56:32,743
I think it'd be fun.

6668
02:56:32,780 --> 02:56:35,360
Maybe it hate me or maybe you hate him.

6669
02:56:35,820 --> 02:56:36,500
I don't think so.

6670
02:56:36,500 --> 02:56:37,490
Now you guys be friends.

6671
02:56:37,520 --> 02:56:37,731
Yeah.

6672
02:56:37,731 --> 02:56:41,000
I think listening to him
on the [inaudible] podcast,

6673
02:56:41,001 --> 02:56:42,860
I would find him completely fascinating.

6674
02:56:42,861 --> 02:56:44,630
I just really respect that.

6675
02:56:45,080 --> 02:56:50,080
Completely off the beaten path choice
of just decided he goes to these places

6676
02:56:51,261 --> 02:56:52,640
and they'll just go and,

6677
02:56:52,641 --> 02:56:52,971
you know,

6678
02:56:52,971 --> 02:56:54,610
hang out in Afghanistan or go,

6679
02:56:54,611 --> 02:56:55,700
it's kind of always been a guy.

6680
02:56:55,701 --> 02:56:56,600
He's done it his way,

6681
02:56:56,601 --> 02:56:57,710
which you can appreciate it.

6682
02:56:58,400 --> 02:56:58,910
Yeah.

6683
02:56:58,910 --> 02:57:03,290
I mean we started off as a musician
and then now what he does is he writes,

6684
02:57:03,291 --> 02:57:07,100
and he does like the spoken word things
apparently is doing a run at Largo in

6685
02:57:07,101 --> 02:57:07,760
December.

6686
02:57:07,760 --> 02:57:11,750
So I might go down there and check that
live shows bad ass and it sells out like

6687
02:57:11,751 --> 02:57:12,584
a motherfucker.

6688
02:57:12,650 --> 02:57:13,190
Well,

6689
02:57:13,190 --> 02:57:14,290
I mean it's uh,

6690
02:57:15,040 --> 02:57:15,771
it's interesting,

6691
02:57:15,771 --> 02:57:18,050
he's kind of like kind
of doing standup but not,

6692
02:57:18,080 --> 02:57:18,261
you know,

6693
02:57:18,261 --> 02:57:21,200
he's really just telling stories
about things so he's not confined,

6694
02:57:21,920 --> 02:57:22,753
which is um,

6695
02:57:23,000 --> 02:57:23,211
you know,

6696
02:57:23,211 --> 02:57:23,630
a lot of,

6697
02:57:23,630 --> 02:57:28,490
a lot of people find like a podcast
very freeing because it's one of the few

6698
02:57:28,491 --> 02:57:30,380
times that comics are,

6699
02:57:30,381 --> 02:57:34,580
aren't confined to this constant
need to be funny like all the time,

6700
02:57:34,610 --> 02:57:35,690
like over and over and over again.

6701
02:57:35,900 --> 02:57:38,060
Like sometimes it shows they're
just funny back and forth,

6702
02:57:38,061 --> 02:57:38,894
funny back and forth.

6703
02:57:38,900 --> 02:57:42,110
But some you don't have to like sometimes
there's a moment in a podcast where

6704
02:57:42,111 --> 02:57:42,944
you just have to,

6705
02:57:42,950 --> 02:57:44,360
you want to kind of explore something.

6706
02:57:44,600 --> 02:57:46,010
You can't really do that on stage though.

6707
02:57:46,190 --> 02:57:46,611
You know,

6708
02:57:46,611 --> 02:57:49,310
like a comic can't really do that on
stage unless they do some sort of a weird

6709
02:57:49,311 --> 02:57:50,960
artsy one person show,

6710
02:57:51,320 --> 02:57:51,711
you know.

6711
02:57:51,711 --> 02:57:53,270
But a guy like Rawlins,

6712
02:57:53,271 --> 02:57:57,350
he doesn't have like any defined
pattern that has shows have to follow.

6713
02:57:57,500 --> 02:57:57,621
Yeah.

6714
02:57:57,621 --> 02:57:58,610
He's not in a box.

6715
02:57:58,720 --> 02:58:01,100
He's not a comedian like he
can get up there and do you,

6716
02:58:01,140 --> 02:58:02,310
I know he has his guitar.

6717
02:58:02,310 --> 02:58:04,380
He tells these epic stories from his life.

6718
02:58:04,410 --> 02:58:04,770
Yeah,

6719
02:58:04,770 --> 02:58:05,210
you're right.

6720
02:58:05,210 --> 02:58:06,043
I'll do whatever you want.

6721
02:58:06,060 --> 02:58:07,890
You're not going to that
show gone make me laugh.

6722
02:58:07,891 --> 02:58:08,200
Clown.

6723
02:58:08,200 --> 02:58:09,870
He did laugh in the
first 10 or 15 minutes.

6724
02:58:09,871 --> 02:58:10,350
Go,

6725
02:58:10,350 --> 02:58:10,710
go.

6726
02:58:10,710 --> 02:58:13,220
It's kind of interesting what you
guys do with fighter in the kid too.

6727
02:58:13,221 --> 02:58:15,030
It's cause like you're doing a podcast,

6728
02:58:15,031 --> 02:58:19,020
but you do a podcast live and you're
doing this podcast live and it's kind of a

6729
02:58:19,021 --> 02:58:19,591
comedy show,

6730
02:58:19,591 --> 02:58:21,480
but it's kind of whatever the
fuck you want it to be show,

6731
02:58:21,790 --> 02:58:22,141
you know,

6732
02:58:22,141 --> 02:58:26,520
you can kind of make your own
sort of format of entertainment.

6733
02:58:26,521 --> 02:58:26,840
Like the,

6734
02:58:26,840 --> 02:58:31,410
the live podcast format is a new
form of entertainment in a way.

6735
02:58:31,411 --> 02:58:32,940
And I've only done a couple of them.

6736
02:58:33,210 --> 02:58:36,060
I did one of my own and
bunch of other people's ones.

6737
02:58:36,450 --> 02:58:37,380
And the thing,

6738
02:58:37,381 --> 02:58:39,930
the interesting thing about
it is it's not the same thing.

6739
02:58:39,930 --> 02:58:41,040
When an audience is there,

6740
02:58:41,220 --> 02:58:42,240
when you're doing it live,

6741
02:58:42,241 --> 02:58:44,240
it becomes way more of like they,

6742
02:58:44,310 --> 02:58:47,610
they're attention span is taken
into consideration much more.

6743
02:58:47,700 --> 02:58:48,270
Yeah,

6744
02:58:48,270 --> 02:58:48,930
and I,

6745
02:58:48,930 --> 02:58:53,310
Brian had the great idea because to
to perform like it's a performance,

6746
02:58:53,430 --> 02:58:54,750
you know they're scripted parts.

6747
02:58:55,020 --> 02:58:58,290
It's broken up the segments
because when he decided to do it,

6748
02:58:58,291 --> 02:59:01,050
I did my research and I went
to some of the life podcast.

6749
02:59:01,051 --> 02:59:01,261
I'm like,

6750
02:59:01,261 --> 02:59:01,830
dude,

6751
02:59:01,830 --> 02:59:04,020
these people are loyal fans devoted,

6752
02:59:04,200 --> 02:59:05,700
but this is boring man.

6753
02:59:05,730 --> 02:59:07,050
It's just two guys on a mic talking.

6754
02:59:07,051 --> 02:59:10,770
There's not much to see and especially
if you're in a comedy plays like if

6755
02:59:10,771 --> 02:59:14,640
you're doing the store or hit the Bray
Improv with are used to seeing big acts

6756
02:59:14,641 --> 02:59:16,230
and people who entertain.

6757
02:59:16,380 --> 02:59:17,850
You got to kind of do your thing,

6758
02:59:17,851 --> 02:59:18,240
man.

6759
02:59:18,240 --> 02:59:18,661
You're not going to,

6760
02:59:18,661 --> 02:59:19,890
he'll just talk like buddies.

6761
02:59:20,030 --> 02:59:20,820
You got to have a plan.

6762
02:59:20,820 --> 02:59:21,001
Yeah.

6763
02:59:21,001 --> 02:59:22,770
If you're doing a big venue for sure.

6764
02:59:22,771 --> 02:59:27,771
If you do it like Kevin Smith used to
have this little theater in Hollywood and

6765
02:59:28,291 --> 02:59:30,150
I did a podcast there with him.

6766
02:59:30,210 --> 02:59:31,590
I did one with Norton there.

6767
02:59:31,591 --> 02:59:33,900
I did my podcast there with
Norton a long time ago.

6768
02:59:34,470 --> 02:59:35,190
And uh,

6769
02:59:35,190 --> 02:59:36,990
his theater only seats,

6770
02:59:36,991 --> 02:59:37,140
like,

6771
02:59:37,140 --> 02:59:38,460
I don't think he has it anymore,

6772
02:59:38,850 --> 02:59:41,430
but it only seats like 40 people.

6773
02:59:41,580 --> 02:59:43,260
It's like this tiny little place.

6774
02:59:43,261 --> 02:59:44,430
It's like essentially like a,

6775
02:59:44,431 --> 02:59:48,090
an acting studio where people
would take acting classes and then,

6776
02:59:48,091 --> 02:59:48,331
you know,

6777
02:59:48,331 --> 02:59:51,040
they'd come down to the stage
and perform and like it's,

6778
02:59:51,120 --> 02:59:51,690
it's,

6779
02:59:51,690 --> 02:59:52,050
it's,

6780
02:59:52,050 --> 02:59:53,010
it was so intimate.

6781
02:59:53,011 --> 02:59:53,770
It was bizarre.

6782
02:59:53,770 --> 02:59:54,660
Was this format,

6783
02:59:54,661 --> 02:59:55,650
was it like a podcast?

6784
02:59:55,651 --> 02:59:57,870
Cause then I don't think you
have to put on a show as much.

6785
02:59:57,900 --> 02:59:58,710
Exactly.

6786
02:59:58,710 --> 02:59:59,281
Podcast.

6787
02:59:59,281 --> 02:59:59,580
Yeah,

6788
02:59:59,580 --> 03:00:02,280
but it's a podcast in
front of a really small,

6789
03:00:02,281 --> 03:00:02,941
super,

6790
03:00:02,941 --> 03:00:04,110
super intimate crowd.

6791
03:00:04,110 --> 03:00:05,220
Like almost too intimate.

6792
03:00:05,221 --> 03:00:06,210
Like Wally George,

6793
03:00:06,300 --> 03:00:06,900
remember that?

6794
03:00:06,900 --> 03:00:07,770
Wally George,

6795
03:00:07,940 --> 03:00:08,491
I remember Wally.

6796
03:00:08,491 --> 03:00:09,210
George.

6797
03:00:09,210 --> 03:00:09,631
I do,

6798
03:00:09,631 --> 03:00:10,321
but I don't,

6799
03:00:10,321 --> 03:00:11,520
the 80s he does.

6800
03:00:11,521 --> 03:00:11,611
He,

6801
03:00:11,611 --> 03:00:14,410
the guy with the weird
hair and he was on pike.

6802
03:00:14,540 --> 03:00:14,760
Yeah,

6803
03:00:14,760 --> 03:00:15,290
yeah,

6804
03:00:15,290 --> 03:00:15,720
yeah.

6805
03:00:15,720 --> 03:00:16,411
Oh that's right.

6806
03:00:16,411 --> 03:00:19,050
He's like cable TV guy was in the audience
of one of these shows because they

6807
03:00:19,051 --> 03:00:20,250
would cut to the audience he was in.

6808
03:00:20,251 --> 03:00:21,740
He filmed in Hana hot areas.

6809
03:00:22,530 --> 03:00:23,580
I gotta I gotta Piss.

6810
03:00:24,390 --> 03:00:25,223
Oh,

6811
03:00:26,550 --> 03:00:27,720
keep this going with that.

6812
03:00:28,160 --> 03:00:28,921
You don't remember.

6813
03:00:28,921 --> 03:00:29,191
Wally.

6814
03:00:29,191 --> 03:00:30,170
George are too young for that,

6815
03:00:30,171 --> 03:00:30,390
right?

6816
03:00:30,390 --> 03:00:31,160
I don't,

6817
03:00:31,160 --> 03:00:33,090
while he's insane.

6818
03:00:33,120 --> 03:00:33,953
What's he from?

6819
03:00:34,320 --> 03:00:35,153
He had this,

6820
03:00:35,290 --> 03:00:36,123
uh,

6821
03:00:36,900 --> 03:00:37,770
I guess it was like,

6822
03:00:37,771 --> 03:00:38,251
you know that,

6823
03:00:38,251 --> 03:00:39,084
um,

6824
03:00:39,490 --> 03:00:40,323
uh,

6825
03:00:40,450 --> 03:00:41,283
uh,

6826
03:00:41,300 --> 03:00:42,000
what uh,

6827
03:00:42,000 --> 03:00:42,481
what's it called?

6828
03:00:42,481 --> 03:00:43,530
Free Access TV

6829
03:00:45,560 --> 03:00:46,130
show.

6830
03:00:46,130 --> 03:00:48,570
There's channel a six in Denver,

6831
03:00:48,571 --> 03:00:49,800
Colorado and he,

6832
03:00:49,950 --> 03:00:52,330
he filmed an Anaheim
and he was super like,

6833
03:00:52,350 --> 03:00:55,200
just like his character was a total d bag,

6834
03:00:55,440 --> 03:00:58,950
but Super Republican d
bag and yelled at people.

6835
03:00:58,960 --> 03:01:00,220
He was just over the God

6836
03:01:00,220 --> 03:01:01,420
damn doing it for ratings.

6837
03:01:01,870 --> 03:01:02,950
A hot seat.

6838
03:01:02,951 --> 03:01:03,280
That's,

6839
03:01:03,280 --> 03:01:04,070
that's the name of it.

6840
03:01:04,070 --> 03:01:04,903
It was.

6841
03:01:05,040 --> 03:01:06,280
Do you still do your podcast,

6842
03:01:06,281 --> 03:01:06,610
Eddie?

6843
03:01:06,610 --> 03:01:06,911
No,

6844
03:01:06,911 --> 03:01:07,330
man.

6845
03:01:07,330 --> 03:01:08,200
You should stop doing it.

6846
03:01:08,440 --> 03:01:09,040
Yeah,

6847
03:01:09,040 --> 03:01:09,850
I just,

6848
03:01:09,850 --> 03:01:10,481
it's just,

6849
03:01:10,481 --> 03:01:11,314
uh,

6850
03:01:12,130 --> 03:01:13,510
maybe I'll come back and do it.

6851
03:01:13,600 --> 03:01:14,433
Maybe I will,

6852
03:01:14,470 --> 03:01:17,460
but I guess we did like 60 or 70 episodes.

6853
03:01:17,461 --> 03:01:17,831
I'm like that.

6854
03:01:17,831 --> 03:01:18,640
I don't even remember.

6855
03:01:18,640 --> 03:01:22,510
I never go back and listen to
him and I sat in enough shit.

6856
03:01:22,630 --> 03:01:22,931
I'm like,

6857
03:01:22,931 --> 03:01:24,190
do I want to be a fucking host?

6858
03:01:24,191 --> 03:01:25,420
I don't want to be a host to shit.

6859
03:01:25,480 --> 03:01:26,020
You know,

6860
03:01:26,020 --> 03:01:26,853
maybe I'll change it.

6861
03:01:26,920 --> 03:01:27,753
Maybe I will,

6862
03:01:27,940 --> 03:01:32,500
but I don't want to be that guy who
says same shit over and over again.

6863
03:01:32,501 --> 03:01:32,980
Because when you're,

6864
03:01:32,980 --> 03:01:34,060
when you're running a show,

6865
03:01:34,500 --> 03:01:35,500
it's you do,

6866
03:01:35,530 --> 03:01:36,221
you have to,

6867
03:01:36,221 --> 03:01:39,430
you have to repeat that story because
some people haven't heard it and then the

6868
03:01:39,431 --> 03:01:41,810
people who have heard at your
hardcore fans will just stare.

6869
03:01:41,810 --> 03:01:43,030
It goes with that fucking show.

6870
03:01:43,240 --> 03:01:44,230
That's on your story too.

6871
03:01:44,280 --> 03:01:46,500
Cause did you have a partner
or was it just you ride?

6872
03:01:46,540 --> 03:01:46,781
Man,

6873
03:01:46,781 --> 03:01:48,190
I'd have a roomful of people.

6874
03:01:48,191 --> 03:01:51,550
I just invited five people at a time
just to have just conversation just like

6875
03:01:51,551 --> 03:01:51,910
this.

6876
03:01:51,910 --> 03:01:53,530
I wanted it four or five people to talk,

6877
03:01:53,740 --> 03:01:55,780
but after awhile I do,

6878
03:01:55,810 --> 03:01:58,390
I get sick of hearing myself
tell the same goddamn story.

6879
03:01:58,510 --> 03:01:59,440
I think I've said enough.

6880
03:01:59,980 --> 03:02:00,910
I think I said enough.

6881
03:02:01,180 --> 03:02:01,660
I mean I do.

6882
03:02:01,660 --> 03:02:03,100
I want to be a host of some shit.

6883
03:02:03,240 --> 03:02:03,621
Well listen,

6884
03:02:03,621 --> 03:02:06,100
when you really don't feel
like I want to be a host,

6885
03:02:06,310 --> 03:02:07,690
they manage to do a podcast.

6886
03:02:07,691 --> 03:02:07,840
Guys,

6887
03:02:07,840 --> 03:02:08,081
you know,

6888
03:02:08,081 --> 03:02:09,160
you could always do this one.

6889
03:02:09,790 --> 03:02:10,300
You know,

6890
03:02:10,300 --> 03:02:10,691
you always,

6891
03:02:10,691 --> 03:02:12,220
you can always come on and do my podcast.

6892
03:02:12,720 --> 03:02:14,200
I'm not talking about being like being,

6893
03:02:14,500 --> 03:02:15,333
uh,

6894
03:02:17,440 --> 03:02:19,060
I'm saying that's what I'm saying.

6895
03:02:19,420 --> 03:02:22,330
Like if you just want to do it
occasionally and just get the itch out,

6896
03:02:22,331 --> 03:02:22,571
you know,

6897
03:02:22,571 --> 03:02:23,530
you've got an open invitation.

6898
03:02:23,670 --> 03:02:24,090
I,

6899
03:02:24,090 --> 03:02:24,590
uh,

6900
03:02:24,590 --> 03:02:25,000
uh,

6901
03:02:25,000 --> 03:02:25,600
you know the,

6902
03:02:25,600 --> 03:02:26,950
have you heard of that show rock line?

6903
03:02:26,951 --> 03:02:28,030
It's been on for 30 years.

6904
03:02:28,031 --> 03:02:30,880
Bob Coburn Kalo as big shirts like that,

6905
03:02:30,881 --> 03:02:32,290
guns and roses kiss,

6906
03:02:32,291 --> 03:02:36,610
like all the big biggest Rick rock legends
we'd get on Keller West once a week.

6907
03:02:36,611 --> 03:02:37,840
It's called rock line.

6908
03:02:37,841 --> 03:02:38,860
It's huge in La.

6909
03:02:39,160 --> 03:02:39,371
The,

6910
03:02:39,371 --> 03:02:39,700
um,

6911
03:02:39,700 --> 03:02:41,110
well Bob Coburn came down with,

6912
03:02:41,170 --> 03:02:42,160
uh,

6913
03:02:42,310 --> 03:02:43,230
some kind of cancer,

6914
03:02:43,240 --> 03:02:43,780
whatever,

6915
03:02:43,780 --> 03:02:47,290
and the show is on hiatus
and the producer of the show,

6916
03:02:47,800 --> 03:02:49,750
he wants me to bring my podcast back.

6917
03:02:49,780 --> 03:02:50,291
And,

6918
03:02:50,291 --> 03:02:51,124
uh,

6919
03:02:51,220 --> 03:02:51,551
he said,

6920
03:02:51,551 --> 03:02:51,870
dude,

6921
03:02:51,870 --> 03:02:54,050
let me put together something for you.

6922
03:02:54,070 --> 03:02:54,340
And,

6923
03:02:54,340 --> 03:02:55,540
and I'm on the fence about it.

6924
03:02:55,720 --> 03:02:55,991
I'm on,

6925
03:02:55,991 --> 03:02:56,450
if,

6926
03:02:56,450 --> 03:02:56,650
you know,

6927
03:02:56,650 --> 03:02:57,221
if we do this,

6928
03:02:57,221 --> 03:02:57,580
how,

6929
03:02:57,580 --> 03:02:57,940
you know,

6930
03:02:57,940 --> 03:02:58,331
who knows?

6931
03:02:58,331 --> 03:02:59,141
Who knows who?

6932
03:02:59,141 --> 03:02:59,974
I Dunno.

6933
03:03:00,460 --> 03:03:01,240
I Dunno.

6934
03:03:01,240 --> 03:03:02,770
Listen to your fun guy to man.

6935
03:03:02,860 --> 03:03:03,660
Just do it.

6936
03:03:03,660 --> 03:03:05,920
It's not like you don't
sign a contract or anything,

6937
03:03:05,921 --> 03:03:06,730
just do it.

6938
03:03:06,730 --> 03:03:08,390
I didn't have to be just like you said,

6939
03:03:08,391 --> 03:03:10,200
they'd have to be in a way where I,

6940
03:03:10,600 --> 03:03:11,460
if I want to just to,

6941
03:03:11,600 --> 03:03:12,433
uh,

6942
03:03:12,790 --> 03:03:14,440
just do it on my pace.

6943
03:03:14,470 --> 03:03:15,340
I don't want people like,

6944
03:03:15,370 --> 03:03:15,491
Oh,

6945
03:03:15,491 --> 03:03:16,990
you got to do with you and show studio.

6946
03:03:17,050 --> 03:03:17,883
You have a studio.

6947
03:03:18,760 --> 03:03:19,271
My Studio,

6948
03:03:19,271 --> 03:03:22,690
my studio actually sucks because it's
a rehearsal studio and sometimes we'll

6949
03:03:22,691 --> 03:03:24,910
have guests and there's
a drummer that practices,

6950
03:03:25,280 --> 03:03:28,740
I've done cow with the drummer
just shredding for two hours.

6951
03:03:29,080 --> 03:03:29,561
I've done that.

6952
03:03:29,561 --> 03:03:30,640
If it becomes a problem,

6953
03:03:30,670 --> 03:03:30,821
well,

6954
03:03:30,821 --> 03:03:31,780
you don't want it Joe's,

6955
03:03:31,781 --> 03:03:31,961
right?

6956
03:03:31,961 --> 03:03:34,030
Like you don't want like
same with the companions.

6957
03:03:34,060 --> 03:03:35,050
Like let's say someone's like,

6958
03:03:35,051 --> 03:03:35,201
Yo,

6959
03:03:35,201 --> 03:03:36,130
we want to take this on,

6960
03:03:36,131 --> 03:03:37,900
pay you guys a jillion dollars.

6961
03:03:38,070 --> 03:03:38,450
It,

6962
03:03:38,450 --> 03:03:39,760
it takes the fun out of it.

6963
03:03:39,761 --> 03:03:40,690
If it's work,

6964
03:03:40,840 --> 03:03:42,850
if we have to see each other once a week,

6965
03:03:42,851 --> 03:03:43,630
bitch listen to me.

6966
03:03:43,630 --> 03:03:43,841
Well,

6967
03:03:43,841 --> 03:03:44,980
if a billions different,

6968
03:03:45,100 --> 03:03:46,510
if I decided to try to do like,

6969
03:03:46,511 --> 03:03:47,470
just to test it out,

6970
03:03:47,760 --> 03:03:48,220
um,

6971
03:03:48,220 --> 03:03:50,170
maybe I'd take you up on your offer and,

6972
03:03:50,260 --> 03:03:51,093
and uh,

6973
03:03:51,250 --> 03:03:51,671
maybe,

6974
03:03:51,671 --> 03:03:51,910
uh,

6975
03:03:51,910 --> 03:03:52,743
you know,

6976
03:03:52,930 --> 03:03:53,381
who knows?

6977
03:03:53,381 --> 03:03:53,741
Maybe,

6978
03:03:53,741 --> 03:03:54,574
um,

6979
03:03:54,670 --> 03:03:55,020
you know,

6980
03:03:55,020 --> 03:03:55,870
it sounds like you don't know.

6981
03:03:56,110 --> 03:03:56,740
I don't know.

6982
03:03:56,740 --> 03:03:57,880
I'm on the fucking fan side

6983
03:03:58,770 --> 03:03:59,603
thing.

6984
03:04:00,650 --> 03:04:00,950
Listen,

6985
03:04:00,950 --> 03:04:03,110
if you ever want to do it from here,

6986
03:04:03,111 --> 03:04:05,060
like one day just for a goof,

6987
03:04:05,090 --> 03:04:06,830
just bring it back one day for a goof.

6988
03:04:07,520 --> 03:04:07,791
You know,

6989
03:04:07,791 --> 03:04:08,660
we could do it together.

6990
03:04:08,720 --> 03:04:09,553
I might do that.

6991
03:04:09,560 --> 03:04:10,393
I might do that.

6992
03:04:10,700 --> 03:04:14,360
You should do whatever the fuck you want
to do and you stopped doing it for a

6993
03:04:14,361 --> 03:04:15,194
reason.

6994
03:04:15,290 --> 03:04:19,010
You stopped doing it because you're so
overwhelmed with responsibilities with

6995
03:04:19,011 --> 03:04:19,791
family,

6996
03:04:19,791 --> 03:04:24,680
which of Jitsu teaching has run an Ebi
tie or it is a lot going on with that.

6997
03:04:24,710 --> 03:04:29,090
It's like fuck I am I going
to have a podcast run EBI,

6998
03:04:29,150 --> 03:04:32,870
run 10th planet and
make music and my fuck.

6999
03:04:32,871 --> 03:04:34,340
When's a lot going on too much.

7000
03:04:34,341 --> 03:04:35,330
It's still a lot going on there.

7001
03:04:35,340 --> 03:04:39,150
I got my son there and these are the
most important years of his life and you

7002
03:04:39,151 --> 03:04:39,230
know,

7003
03:04:39,230 --> 03:04:41,360
I'm hanging out with him and
I'm trying to shut things off.

7004
03:04:41,360 --> 03:04:41,630
Um,

7005
03:04:41,630 --> 03:04:45,500
I'm really focusing on trying
to just shut the world off.

7006
03:04:45,530 --> 03:04:47,000
Was Your podcast making money?

7007
03:04:47,180 --> 03:04:47,580
Well,

7008
03:04:47,580 --> 03:04:47,730
no.

7009
03:04:47,730 --> 03:04:48,050
No.

7010
03:04:48,050 --> 03:04:50,390
I never tried to even
look for fucking sponsors,

7011
03:04:50,391 --> 03:04:50,631
man.

7012
03:04:50,631 --> 03:04:51,464
I just,

7013
03:04:51,500 --> 03:04:52,610
I was just doing it on my,

7014
03:04:52,611 --> 03:04:52,940
uh,

7015
03:04:52,940 --> 03:04:55,490
my own free time and
just for the fun of it.

7016
03:04:55,670 --> 03:04:57,140
And I think I've said enough man,

7017
03:04:57,260 --> 03:04:57,800
they're the,

7018
03:04:57,800 --> 03:04:59,660
all the episodes are still up on youtube.

7019
03:05:00,230 --> 03:05:00,861
I don't want to fuck,

7020
03:05:00,861 --> 03:05:01,760
let me tell you something man.

7021
03:05:01,790 --> 03:05:03,200
Even having sponsors,

7022
03:05:03,230 --> 03:05:05,060
even having sponsors is a fucking,

7023
03:05:05,090 --> 03:05:08,570
is a responsibility you have to consider
is what have you ever sponsored that's

7024
03:05:08,571 --> 03:05:09,404
not good.

7025
03:05:09,610 --> 03:05:12,650
And I go to a response or that rips
people off or something that where it goes

7026
03:05:12,651 --> 03:05:12,891
wrong.

7027
03:05:12,891 --> 03:05:14,630
Like there was a sponsor that came to me,

7028
03:05:14,631 --> 03:05:18,800
which is like an Uber for Nannies for
like people taking care of your kids.

7029
03:05:18,801 --> 03:05:21,260
It's like you can call us a right idea.

7030
03:05:21,290 --> 03:05:22,430
It's a terrible idea.

7031
03:05:22,431 --> 03:05:23,360
You don't even know this part.

7032
03:05:23,361 --> 03:05:24,194
What did they behave like?

7033
03:05:24,200 --> 03:05:25,070
Uber drivers.

7034
03:05:27,050 --> 03:05:27,883
You don't even know

7035
03:05:29,380 --> 03:05:31,190
how I heard it for a second.

7036
03:05:31,191 --> 03:05:33,380
I go no fucking way.

7037
03:05:33,560 --> 03:05:38,170
I was like no blocking guaranteed
that run through like a rigger on,

7038
03:05:38,190 --> 03:05:39,240
on chat.

7039
03:05:39,320 --> 03:05:40,550
You've got gotta be careful that stuff.

7040
03:05:40,551 --> 03:05:43,760
And I've had this conversation with
Joe before to certain sponsors.

7041
03:05:43,761 --> 03:05:44,480
We've,

7042
03:05:44,480 --> 03:05:44,900
we've,

7043
03:05:44,900 --> 03:05:45,733
we've turned down,

7044
03:05:45,740 --> 03:05:50,150
I won't say the name of the company to
Mag a sponsor because cal and I a don't

7045
03:05:50,151 --> 03:05:50,811
believe in the product.

7046
03:05:50,811 --> 03:05:52,440
B are our audience.

7047
03:05:52,450 --> 03:05:52,731
Be like,

7048
03:05:52,731 --> 03:05:54,050
get the fuck Outta here.

7049
03:05:54,080 --> 03:05:54,891
This isn't really,

7050
03:05:54,891 --> 03:05:56,270
it was just doing it for a paycheck.

7051
03:05:56,510 --> 03:05:57,320
So we turned them down.

7052
03:05:57,320 --> 03:06:02,320
We had one that was a soup company and
super suit suit and you'd have to go get

7053
03:06:02,721 --> 03:06:06,290
tailored and they send the suit in
the mail like these worldclass suits.

7054
03:06:06,440 --> 03:06:07,273
What's wrong with that?

7055
03:06:07,310 --> 03:06:07,760
Well,

7056
03:06:07,760 --> 03:06:12,080
what's wrong with that is both are mine
and counts came in the mail and they

7057
03:06:12,081 --> 03:06:13,310
were just so shitty.

7058
03:06:13,780 --> 03:06:18,500
Can't do this because dude's going to
order suits and then they come all shitty.

7059
03:06:18,501 --> 03:06:18,981
And then I'm like,

7060
03:06:18,981 --> 03:06:19,221
dude,

7061
03:06:19,221 --> 03:06:19,580
this is,

7062
03:06:19,580 --> 03:06:20,190
you know,

7063
03:06:20,190 --> 03:06:21,023
can't have it.

7064
03:06:21,540 --> 03:06:22,490
You know how it goes.

7065
03:06:22,640 --> 03:06:23,990
Well that's smart that you guys did that.

7066
03:06:24,020 --> 03:06:27,410
That's smart because the last thing you
want to do is disappoint your fans in a

7067
03:06:27,411 --> 03:06:29,210
way like that where you can avoid it.

7068
03:06:29,270 --> 03:06:29,541
You know,

7069
03:06:29,541 --> 03:06:30,860
it's one thing if you get tricked,

7070
03:06:31,400 --> 03:06:32,091
but if you,

7071
03:06:32,091 --> 03:06:32,420
uh,

7072
03:06:32,420 --> 03:06:33,680
if you could avoid it,

7073
03:06:34,160 --> 03:06:38,810
it's his hard because right now there
it's really opening up the market as far

7074
03:06:38,811 --> 03:06:39,021
as,

7075
03:06:39,021 --> 03:06:39,500
um,

7076
03:06:39,500 --> 03:06:41,510
people that are advertising on podcasts,

7077
03:06:41,660 --> 03:06:42,500
but they're still,

7078
03:06:42,530 --> 03:06:44,150
they're not like mainstream names.

7079
03:06:44,151 --> 03:06:48,020
You don't hear like Chevrolet
advertising on podcasts or you know,

7080
03:06:48,021 --> 03:06:48,854
Samsung,

7081
03:06:48,950 --> 03:06:49,940
I had your Samsung did.

7082
03:06:50,480 --> 03:06:50,691
Well,

7083
03:06:50,691 --> 03:06:52,130
they should if to Latin mass,

7084
03:06:52,160 --> 03:06:52,993
not shit on him.

7085
03:06:53,700 --> 03:06:53,990
Well,

7086
03:06:53,990 --> 03:06:54,801
if they're smart,

7087
03:06:54,801 --> 03:06:55,140
they,

7088
03:06:55,140 --> 03:06:56,070
because there's no better

7089
03:06:56,070 --> 03:06:58,230
platform for loyal listeners.

7090
03:06:58,500 --> 03:07:01,800
Then a fucking podcast who's going
to listen to and talk for whatever,

7091
03:07:01,860 --> 03:07:02,700
six hours a week,

7092
03:07:02,701 --> 03:07:03,331
nine hours a week.

7093
03:07:03,331 --> 03:07:06,300
They're dedicated and until
there's nothing like it,

7094
03:07:06,580 --> 03:07:07,620
TV ain't shit.

7095
03:07:08,010 --> 03:07:08,160
Oh,

7096
03:07:08,160 --> 03:07:09,590
32nd commercial ain't shit.

7097
03:07:09,591 --> 03:07:10,590
If people want to fast forward,

7098
03:07:10,650 --> 03:07:11,371
no one's watching.

7099
03:07:11,371 --> 03:07:13,350
T I have 500 fucking channels.

7100
03:07:13,351 --> 03:07:14,700
I Never Watch TV.

7101
03:07:15,060 --> 03:07:15,840
I watch TV,

7102
03:07:15,840 --> 03:07:16,530
I watch TV,

7103
03:07:16,530 --> 03:07:16,990
sports,

7104
03:07:16,990 --> 03:07:17,823
I watch now.

7105
03:07:17,860 --> 03:07:18,930
I watch Netflix.

7106
03:07:18,990 --> 03:07:20,010
I generally don't,

7107
03:07:20,160 --> 03:07:22,260
I'm always on my apple TV.

7108
03:07:22,380 --> 03:07:23,580
I'm always on Netflix,

7109
03:07:23,620 --> 03:07:24,690
always on the apple,

7110
03:07:24,810 --> 03:07:25,710
always on that flicks.

7111
03:07:25,830 --> 03:07:29,310
The only time I watch regular TV is when
the ultimate fighter comes on or so I'm

7112
03:07:29,311 --> 03:07:32,270
just saying the advertisement
as far as podcasts,

7113
03:07:32,550 --> 03:07:34,520
if they were smart man with uh,

7114
03:07:34,580 --> 03:07:38,340
with your audience or someone
like Dan Carlin or NPR,

7115
03:07:38,341 --> 03:07:39,820
like dots where it's at these days,

7116
03:07:40,170 --> 03:07:43,140
more and more they will
more and more they grow.

7117
03:07:43,141 --> 03:07:46,440
Dan Carlin told Tommy's in a weird
position because he gets a fuck load of

7118
03:07:46,441 --> 03:07:46,891
downloads,

7119
03:07:46,891 --> 03:07:51,210
but he does his podcast so infrequently
that the best model for him as far as

7120
03:07:51,211 --> 03:07:54,480
cash is actually to do
it through subscriptions.

7121
03:07:54,660 --> 03:07:56,010
So when you order it from iTunes,

7122
03:07:56,011 --> 03:07:57,300
like especially the older episodes,

7123
03:07:57,301 --> 03:07:59,460
it costs a dollar 99
that makes sense for him.

7124
03:07:59,490 --> 03:08:00,860
But let me tell you something,

7125
03:08:00,890 --> 03:08:02,670
it is worth so much more than that.

7126
03:08:02,671 --> 03:08:05,670
Like his fucking podcast or
they're like a work of art.

7127
03:08:05,700 --> 03:08:06,121
Correct.

7128
03:08:06,121 --> 03:08:06,630
Cool.

7129
03:08:06,630 --> 03:08:07,560
Dan Carlin,

7130
03:08:07,890 --> 03:08:08,390
he's got,

7131
03:08:08,390 --> 03:08:08,620
I'll,

7132
03:08:08,620 --> 03:08:10,890
I'll send you a link
to a hardcore history,

7133
03:08:11,070 --> 03:08:11,490
wrath,

7134
03:08:11,490 --> 03:08:15,360
wrath of the cons all about
Gingiss Khan and the Mongol Empire.

7135
03:08:15,930 --> 03:08:20,260
If he was our history teacher and we
would all be fucking into history,

7136
03:08:20,280 --> 03:08:20,851
love history,

7137
03:08:20,851 --> 03:08:21,900
he's such a dynamo.

7138
03:08:21,901 --> 03:08:23,340
He was on last week and my podcast,

7139
03:08:23,520 --> 03:08:27,970
he's such a dynamic guy and we were just
talking about seeing above cars son.

7140
03:08:28,200 --> 03:08:29,070
I love that dude.

7141
03:08:29,190 --> 03:08:30,150
He's so awesome.

7142
03:08:30,480 --> 03:08:30,811
You guys,

7143
03:08:30,811 --> 03:08:32,940
are you guys open the show
with flat earth stuff?

7144
03:08:33,200 --> 03:08:33,400
No,

7145
03:08:33,400 --> 03:08:33,560
no,

7146
03:08:33,560 --> 03:08:33,741
no,

7147
03:08:33,741 --> 03:08:33,890
no,

7148
03:08:33,890 --> 03:08:34,071
no,

7149
03:08:34,071 --> 03:08:34,620
no,

7150
03:08:34,620 --> 03:08:35,453
no.

7151
03:08:35,550 --> 03:08:37,330
Not Two sweater.

7152
03:08:37,370 --> 03:08:38,203
Felicia.

7153
03:08:38,340 --> 03:08:38,820
What's that?

7154
03:08:38,820 --> 03:08:39,510
Michael Shermer.

7155
03:08:39,510 --> 03:08:39,691
Yeah,

7156
03:08:39,691 --> 03:08:40,410
Michael Shermer.

7157
03:08:40,410 --> 03:08:41,940
Dan Carlin to slap somebody.

7158
03:08:41,941 --> 03:08:42,840
If you brought that up though.

7159
03:08:42,930 --> 03:08:43,231
Yeah,

7160
03:08:43,231 --> 03:08:44,490
he's not really into flat earth,

7161
03:08:44,690 --> 03:08:45,301
but it's,

7162
03:08:45,301 --> 03:08:45,750
he's,

7163
03:08:45,750 --> 03:08:50,370
he's got such a deep knowledge of so
much fucking history and he prepares for

7164
03:08:50,371 --> 03:08:51,840
months to get these things ready.

7165
03:08:51,870 --> 03:08:52,710
That's how it's different,

7166
03:08:52,711 --> 03:08:52,951
right?

7167
03:08:52,951 --> 03:08:54,360
Like a lot of podcasts,

7168
03:08:54,810 --> 03:08:55,470
like you know,

7169
03:08:55,470 --> 03:08:55,861
like you,

7170
03:08:55,861 --> 03:08:57,090
like you said on the show,

7171
03:08:57,180 --> 03:08:59,430
you just turn on you having a
conversation with your buddies.

7172
03:08:59,640 --> 03:09:04,640
Carlin has to fucking go balls deep
into how he's going to articulate it,

7173
03:09:05,310 --> 03:09:06,450
the plan and there's,

7174
03:09:06,510 --> 03:09:06,691
you know,

7175
03:09:06,691 --> 03:09:08,160
the start and finish in its history.

7176
03:09:08,220 --> 03:09:09,360
So it's not an opinion.

7177
03:09:09,390 --> 03:09:10,950
Well we were talking
about it and I was like,

7178
03:09:10,951 --> 03:09:15,240
you know what we're doing as a podcast
where you're doing is like an audio art

7179
03:09:15,241 --> 03:09:15,601
piece.

7180
03:09:15,601 --> 03:09:16,710
It's like a work of art.

7181
03:09:16,890 --> 03:09:19,680
That's also historically
accurate audio book.

7182
03:09:21,390 --> 03:09:23,610
You termed an audio show.

7183
03:09:23,790 --> 03:09:24,241
Yeah,

7184
03:09:24,241 --> 03:09:24,660
he's white.

7185
03:09:24,660 --> 03:09:26,130
Way More of a now I use that.

7186
03:09:26,520 --> 03:09:27,220
Where does it get out?

7187
03:09:27,220 --> 03:09:28,320
Where did he get his,

7188
03:09:28,321 --> 03:09:29,010
uh,

7189
03:09:29,010 --> 03:09:30,180
like what is,

7190
03:09:30,600 --> 03:09:32,480
he knows obviously he
knows everything on goal.

7191
03:09:32,481 --> 03:09:34,260
He can his con where does
it get its information?

7192
03:09:34,290 --> 03:09:38,520
He gives you a bunch of
different references that
he uses from various history

7193
03:09:38,521 --> 03:09:42,570
books and he also shows the discrepancies
and the opinions how one person

7194
03:09:42,571 --> 03:09:43,890
believed it was this but another person.

7195
03:09:43,891 --> 03:09:46,110
But so he gives you a
balanced perspective too,

7196
03:09:46,320 --> 03:09:49,170
but then relays the undeniable facts.

7197
03:09:49,230 --> 03:09:51,570
So he tells you when there's
some vagueness in history,

7198
03:09:51,630 --> 03:09:54,160
which I really appreciate too
because he's not dogmatic.

7199
03:09:54,190 --> 03:09:57,160
He doesn't have like one idea in his
head of how things absolutely went down.

7200
03:09:57,490 --> 03:09:58,020
So,

7201
03:09:58,020 --> 03:10:00,010
and he's just so entertaining man.

7202
03:10:00,040 --> 03:10:01,720
Cause he has a background in um,

7203
03:10:01,780 --> 03:10:02,920
in talk radio.

7204
03:10:03,220 --> 03:10:07,630
So he's just so good at being
like a professional broadcaster.

7205
03:10:07,780 --> 03:10:10,540
And then the guy's a maniac
when it comes to history.

7206
03:10:10,541 --> 03:10:11,350
So he does this.

7207
03:10:11,350 --> 03:10:13,270
He did the seat series on World War One.

7208
03:10:13,271 --> 03:10:16,000
I have no idea how fucking
crazy world war one was.

7209
03:10:16,300 --> 03:10:17,280
No idea on nuts.

7210
03:10:17,680 --> 03:10:19,030
That one dude,

7211
03:10:19,300 --> 03:10:19,790
you got to live.

7212
03:10:19,790 --> 03:10:20,410
They're all good.

7213
03:10:20,410 --> 03:10:20,891
He's pretty,

7214
03:10:20,891 --> 03:10:21,131
no.

7215
03:10:21,131 --> 03:10:24,310
Did you know that Hitler was
actually a soldier in World War One?

7216
03:10:24,340 --> 03:10:25,510
Did you talk about that?

7217
03:10:25,760 --> 03:10:27,040
And not only with the a soldier,

7218
03:10:27,041 --> 03:10:27,940
but he was one of the most,

7219
03:10:28,090 --> 03:10:31,840
he got like hardcore purple
heart type shit from Germany.

7220
03:10:31,990 --> 03:10:34,570
He did the hardcore shit he wanted.

7221
03:10:34,571 --> 03:10:35,170
Is that true?

7222
03:10:35,170 --> 03:10:35,380
Go,

7223
03:10:35,380 --> 03:10:36,040
hold on.

7224
03:10:36,040 --> 03:10:36,851
Hold on real quick.

7225
03:10:36,851 --> 03:10:37,880
Dropping knowledge on day.

7226
03:10:40,010 --> 03:10:44,440
If I know that you might've read
that from one of those sites.

7227
03:10:45,420 --> 03:10:46,080
I mean,

7228
03:10:46,080 --> 03:10:47,280
I'd never heard that about,

7229
03:10:50,330 --> 03:10:52,510
I heard that he was a hardcore,

7230
03:10:52,810 --> 03:10:56,130
he's one serious like awards war time.

7231
03:10:56,910 --> 03:10:58,030
He was a war hero.

7232
03:10:58,560 --> 03:11:01,900
He got behind them because he was
so hardcore and he's right on this,

7233
03:11:01,901 --> 03:11:02,430
I feel like,

7234
03:11:02,430 --> 03:11:03,263
is he,

7235
03:11:03,450 --> 03:11:04,300
what does he do his,

7236
03:11:04,301 --> 03:11:05,134
um,

7237
03:11:05,650 --> 03:11:06,483
what does it say here?

7238
03:11:06,580 --> 03:11:07,930
Did he was doing it all this stuff.

7239
03:11:08,570 --> 03:11:09,610
First job,

7240
03:11:09,730 --> 03:11:13,260
the most dangerous job was
sending messages to the
front line from headquarters

7241
03:11:13,261 --> 03:11:14,094
at the front line.

7242
03:11:14,110 --> 03:11:15,700
That was the worst that
he volunteered for,

7243
03:11:15,701 --> 03:11:16,750
that he got hurt.

7244
03:11:16,751 --> 03:11:18,940
And could got discharged
and he's all fucked up.

7245
03:11:19,000 --> 03:11:20,140
He didn't want to get discharged.

7246
03:11:20,141 --> 03:11:21,610
You want it to go back to front,

7247
03:11:21,611 --> 03:11:22,211
not graded,

7248
03:11:22,211 --> 03:11:22,390
Huh?

7249
03:11:22,390 --> 03:11:22,480
Yeah.

7250
03:11:22,480 --> 03:11:23,313
He's super crazy.

7251
03:11:23,710 --> 03:11:24,640
Super Crazy.

7252
03:11:24,880 --> 03:11:25,571
That's interesting.

7253
03:11:25,571 --> 03:11:26,260
Take gangster.

7254
03:11:26,260 --> 03:11:26,860
I never,

7255
03:11:26,860 --> 03:11:28,720
he didn't bring that up
at all but that wasn't,

7256
03:11:28,750 --> 03:11:29,081
you know,

7257
03:11:29,081 --> 03:11:31,690
obviously if you're going to
do a piece about world war one,

7258
03:11:31,810 --> 03:11:35,050
Hitler doesn't play a big part unless
you're going to continue with World War

7259
03:11:35,080 --> 03:11:40,080
Two and talk about is serving the
transition I guess if he goes to one.

7260
03:11:40,630 --> 03:11:41,020
Yeah,

7261
03:11:41,020 --> 03:11:41,560
for sure.

7262
03:11:41,560 --> 03:11:42,341
I did not know that.

7263
03:11:42,341 --> 03:11:43,150
That's an interesting,

7264
03:11:43,150 --> 03:11:46,360
that's an interesting because a
lot of shit about world war two,

7265
03:11:46,361 --> 03:11:47,530
that fuck man,

7266
03:11:47,531 --> 03:11:48,400
that I didn't know that.

7267
03:11:48,580 --> 03:11:49,630
It's fascinating shit.

7268
03:11:49,631 --> 03:11:52,900
How we'll work to connects to JFK.

7269
03:11:53,170 --> 03:11:54,780
How that all comes together.

7270
03:11:54,790 --> 03:11:55,571
Fog.

7271
03:11:55,571 --> 03:11:56,530
It's a gnarly shit.

7272
03:11:56,710 --> 03:11:58,680
It's way better than fucking uh,

7273
03:11:59,080 --> 03:12:03,280
game of Thrones cause it's real cause
it actually really happened to find out.

7274
03:12:03,281 --> 03:12:05,440
Exactly because what
you get in high schools,

7275
03:12:05,590 --> 03:12:10,590
you get a basic jack and Jill versions
of what the fuck happened because he had

7276
03:12:11,380 --> 03:12:11,920
done,

7277
03:12:11,920 --> 03:12:12,191
oh,

7278
03:12:12,191 --> 03:12:16,600
this guy was shot and then the world went
to war for an Dan whatever and hungry

7279
03:12:16,780 --> 03:12:19,810
and there's so much crazy shit involved.

7280
03:12:20,080 --> 03:12:24,870
It's really as like a some kind of mini
series like you want to get into World

7281
03:12:24,870 --> 03:12:25,703
War II and JFK.

7282
03:12:25,750 --> 03:12:28,180
Lot of movies on world war season,

7283
03:12:28,181 --> 03:12:29,110
mini series.

7284
03:12:29,111 --> 03:12:30,370
It's so complex.

7285
03:12:30,371 --> 03:12:31,540
There's so many players.

7286
03:12:31,690 --> 03:12:32,351
Jesus go,

7287
03:12:32,351 --> 03:12:33,550
if Kalyn was here right now,

7288
03:12:33,551 --> 03:12:38,050
he would drop some knowledge on
us about it that he remembers.

7289
03:12:38,080 --> 03:12:39,520
Does he remember a lot about World War II,

7290
03:12:39,710 --> 03:12:40,181
World War II,

7291
03:12:40,181 --> 03:12:40,540
buff?

7292
03:12:40,540 --> 03:12:41,530
I don't think so.

7293
03:12:41,560 --> 03:12:42,730
He loves history though,

7294
03:12:42,880 --> 03:12:43,780
so drop it.

7295
03:12:43,781 --> 03:12:44,890
Even if he doesn't know

7296
03:12:46,600 --> 03:12:47,433
that's what we do

7297
03:12:49,060 --> 03:12:49,860
and I just dropped it.

7298
03:12:49,860 --> 03:12:50,693
Thanks.

7299
03:12:50,890 --> 03:12:51,680
It's a,

7300
03:12:51,680 --> 03:12:51,980
there's

7301
03:12:51,980 --> 03:12:56,420
a moment in history where you go back
and look at it and things will never be

7302
03:12:56,421 --> 03:12:57,590
the same now Arthur,

7303
03:12:57,610 --> 03:12:58,443
right?

7304
03:12:58,970 --> 03:12:59,260
No.

7305
03:12:59,260 --> 03:12:59,500
Dot.

7306
03:12:59,500 --> 03:13:00,470
It's the author.

7307
03:13:00,471 --> 03:13:01,304
An idle

7308
03:13:02,580 --> 03:13:05,840
time had a Adolf Hitler
is man of the year when

7309
03:13:08,370 --> 03:13:10,070
you got the weirdest shit ever.

7310
03:13:10,160 --> 03:13:10,993
Yes.

7311
03:13:11,580 --> 03:13:12,650
Julian [inaudible].

7312
03:13:12,880 --> 03:13:15,050
Man of the year for Time magazine,

7313
03:13:15,470 --> 03:13:19,940
man of the year before they turned
before everything went wrong.

7314
03:13:20,720 --> 03:13:22,790
But at first ever United States,

7315
03:13:23,670 --> 03:13:24,503
Adolf Hitler,

7316
03:13:24,650 --> 03:13:25,670
they were into him.

7317
03:13:25,730 --> 03:13:27,200
Eddie is dropping some serious words.

7318
03:13:27,201 --> 03:13:29,900
Are Real knowledge on
your ass now was Hitler,

7319
03:13:29,901 --> 03:13:31,340
was Hitler not a vegetarian?

7320
03:13:31,670 --> 03:13:32,030
I Dunno,

7321
03:13:32,030 --> 03:13:32,451
I go with,

7322
03:13:32,451 --> 03:13:33,020
no,

7323
03:13:33,020 --> 03:13:33,621
I think that was,

7324
03:13:33,621 --> 03:13:35,870
I think that was a rumor
that Hitler was a vegetarian.

7325
03:13:35,900 --> 03:13:37,430
He also did a shitload of judge.

7326
03:13:38,630 --> 03:13:39,440
Uh,

7327
03:13:39,440 --> 03:13:40,220
I think he was.

7328
03:13:40,220 --> 03:13:40,670
He was,

7329
03:13:40,670 --> 03:13:41,510
do you know that he was,

7330
03:13:42,440 --> 03:13:42,651
you know,

7331
03:13:42,651 --> 03:13:45,990
he was an architect and all
the major buildings in all the,

7332
03:13:46,400 --> 03:13:47,390
in Germany.

7333
03:13:47,630 --> 03:13:48,390
He designed them.

7334
03:13:48,390 --> 03:13:50,810
He was into designing
not only the buildings,

7335
03:13:50,990 --> 03:13:55,640
but you know those giant Nazi parades
with all the giant crazy shit.

7336
03:13:55,820 --> 03:13:58,610
He choreographed and
designed all that shit.

7337
03:13:58,640 --> 03:13:58,821
I mean,

7338
03:13:58,821 --> 03:14:01,700
what a documentary called
the architect of doom.

7339
03:14:02,030 --> 03:14:03,580
It's about Adolf Hitler being,

7340
03:14:03,650 --> 03:14:06,620
that's why he started hating the Jews
because he was trying to get into this art

7341
03:14:06,621 --> 03:14:10,420
academy that was run by
Jews and they denied him,

7342
03:14:10,470 --> 03:14:11,170
Bro.

7343
03:14:11,170 --> 03:14:13,070
[inaudible] podcast.

7344
03:14:13,130 --> 03:14:13,910
There you go,

7345
03:14:13,910 --> 03:14:14,151
dude.

7346
03:14:14,151 --> 03:14:15,710
I'm a white petit and world war two.

7347
03:14:15,770 --> 03:14:20,770
You guys just haven't even walked into
the gym and that's all it says that prior

7348
03:14:21,501 --> 03:14:22,910
to 1937,

7349
03:14:23,390 --> 03:14:24,260
he uh,

7350
03:14:24,710 --> 03:14:28,040
he ate meat and then after 37 on,

7351
03:14:28,041 --> 03:14:29,150
towards the end of his life,

7352
03:14:29,180 --> 03:14:30,770
he started becoming vegetarian.

7353
03:14:30,771 --> 03:14:32,320
That's why he became crazy.

7354
03:14:32,390 --> 03:14:36,770
Apparently had chronic flatulence sort
of thing or as far to not try to smear

7355
03:14:36,771 --> 03:14:36,951
him.

7356
03:14:36,951 --> 03:14:37,281
Yes.

7357
03:14:37,281 --> 03:14:38,120
And he sucked.

7358
03:14:38,121 --> 03:14:41,120
Boy's Dick still always
far just like a smear

7359
03:14:42,970 --> 03:14:43,803
farting.

7360
03:14:47,000 --> 03:14:48,920
How many leaders that far problems?

7361
03:14:48,921 --> 03:14:52,400
They probably like 80% of leaders probably
had heart problems or drinking scotch

7362
03:14:52,401 --> 03:14:53,270
all fucking night.

7363
03:14:53,300 --> 03:14:54,020
Well the um,

7364
03:14:54,020 --> 03:14:58,190
the meth thing is crazy because apparently
like a lot of world leaders were on

7365
03:14:58,191 --> 03:14:59,060
speed back then.

7366
03:14:59,330 --> 03:15:00,380
Like that was a big issue.

7367
03:15:00,620 --> 03:15:04,160
Now one of the things about Hillary
Clinton that popped up was that she was on

7368
03:15:04,161 --> 03:15:04,460
PR,

7369
03:15:04,460 --> 03:15:06,770
I think it was pro vigil or new vigil.

7370
03:15:07,100 --> 03:15:09,680
Provigil Provigil is a,

7371
03:15:09,681 --> 03:15:10,070
uh,

7372
03:15:10,070 --> 03:15:10,903
it's like that,

7373
03:15:10,940 --> 03:15:14,150
that stimulant that a fighter
pilots use to stay awake.

7374
03:15:14,390 --> 03:15:15,560
Like it keeps you on point.

7375
03:15:15,561 --> 03:15:19,760
It's illegal in the Olympics now
because it's some sort of a performance

7376
03:15:19,761 --> 03:15:20,171
enhancing.

7377
03:15:20,171 --> 03:15:20,631
She's supposed to.

7378
03:15:20,631 --> 03:15:21,640
She supposedly on that so,

7379
03:15:21,650 --> 03:15:21,771
well,

7380
03:15:21,771 --> 03:15:22,700
she's on that.

7381
03:15:24,840 --> 03:15:29,280
This is bringing this up is because
this lady was telling me that her,

7382
03:15:29,330 --> 03:15:30,860
her friend's husband is on,

7383
03:15:31,250 --> 03:15:32,090
he's on Adderall.

7384
03:15:32,091 --> 03:15:33,400
She was going off about Adderall.

7385
03:15:33,440 --> 03:15:34,940
She's like my friend's
husbands on Adderall.

7386
03:15:34,941 --> 03:15:35,774
He takes it every day.

7387
03:15:36,440 --> 03:15:37,050
Every day.

7388
03:15:37,050 --> 03:15:37,960
Takes Adderall.

7389
03:15:38,180 --> 03:15:40,640
Like he says he needs it takes
to keep up the pace of the day.

7390
03:15:40,850 --> 03:15:42,410
Like that is math.

7391
03:15:42,510 --> 03:15:43,120
Yes.

7392
03:15:43,120 --> 03:15:43,641
It's approved.

7393
03:15:43,641 --> 03:15:44,271
And then it's like,

7394
03:15:44,271 --> 03:15:45,770
it's like the same as math.

7395
03:15:45,771 --> 03:15:48,050
It's like you're taking a
controlled dose of meth every day.

7396
03:15:48,200 --> 03:15:50,220
How many people are out
there just taking math.

7397
03:15:50,930 --> 03:15:51,481
It's a,

7398
03:15:51,481 --> 03:15:52,920
you watch breaking bad a lot.

7399
03:15:53,170 --> 03:15:53,330
Yeah,

7400
03:15:53,330 --> 03:15:53,881
but that's math.

7401
03:15:53,881 --> 03:15:54,714
Math,

7402
03:15:56,160 --> 03:15:56,371
math,

7403
03:15:56,371 --> 03:15:56,820
math.

7404
03:15:56,820 --> 03:15:57,720
Jamie pulled up.

7405
03:15:57,721 --> 03:16:00,390
How many people are a on Adderall?

7406
03:16:00,450 --> 03:16:01,650
Say how many people,

7407
03:16:01,651 --> 03:16:02,910
how many prescriptions of Adderall?

7408
03:16:02,970 --> 03:16:04,800
What were your fighter pilot drugs called?

7409
03:16:04,801 --> 03:16:05,550
What?

7410
03:16:05,550 --> 03:16:07,230
Let's just take a guess real quick.

7411
03:16:07,260 --> 03:16:08,730
Let's take a guess on Adderall.

7412
03:16:08,760 --> 03:16:08,971
Yeah.

7413
03:16:08,971 --> 03:16:10,200
How many people on Adderall?

7414
03:16:10,230 --> 03:16:11,130
How many prescriptions?

7415
03:16:11,250 --> 03:16:12,300
Cause that's all you really know.

7416
03:16:12,301 --> 03:16:13,440
You know how many
prescriptions are written?

7417
03:16:13,441 --> 03:16:15,270
I don't know what that
means as far as people.

7418
03:16:15,690 --> 03:16:18,670
I think 10% what?

7419
03:16:18,730 --> 03:16:19,261
How many million?

7420
03:16:19,261 --> 03:16:20,070
Give me a million.

7421
03:16:20,070 --> 03:16:21,060
How many prescriptions?

7422
03:16:21,510 --> 03:16:23,150
300 million.

7423
03:16:28,260 --> 03:16:29,040
3 million.

7424
03:16:29,040 --> 03:16:31,230
3 million people and now it's seven.

7425
03:16:31,350 --> 03:16:32,490
I'm going to go 6 million.

7426
03:16:32,610 --> 03:16:34,430
6 million people in that
are almost six months.

7427
03:16:34,950 --> 03:16:35,970
More than 6 million.

7428
03:16:36,120 --> 03:16:36,301
Well,

7429
03:16:36,301 --> 03:16:41,301
let's find out these prescriptions
in 2015 for Adderall did this,

7430
03:16:42,480 --> 03:16:43,020
this work.

7431
03:16:43,020 --> 03:16:43,711
Think about that.

7432
03:16:43,711 --> 03:16:44,910
Like the prescription drugs,

7433
03:16:45,240 --> 03:16:45,631
legal.

7434
03:16:45,631 --> 03:16:46,140
They are,

7435
03:16:46,140 --> 03:16:48,060
how destructive they are,

7436
03:16:48,061 --> 03:16:49,080
how dangerous they are,

7437
03:16:49,290 --> 03:16:50,370
and they're totally illegal.

7438
03:16:50,700 --> 03:16:54,240
And so what happens in Arizona
just sits down and just like,

7439
03:16:54,510 --> 03:16:55,343
oh,

7440
03:16:55,410 --> 03:16:56,400
everything's fine.

7441
03:16:56,580 --> 03:16:57,690
I just believe everything.

7442
03:16:57,691 --> 03:16:58,520
They fucking tell me.

7443
03:16:58,520 --> 03:16:59,580
Did you see Arizona?

7444
03:16:59,850 --> 03:17:02,010
That's the craziest shit ever right there.

7445
03:17:02,610 --> 03:17:03,091
Arizona.

7446
03:17:03,091 --> 03:17:08,091
They're trying to legalize weed and
the number one funder to go against the

7447
03:17:08,281 --> 03:17:12,360
legalization of weed is from the company
that makes that fucking crazy pain drug

7448
03:17:12,361 --> 03:17:15,300
that's many times stronger than Oxycontin,

7449
03:17:15,301 --> 03:17:16,680
fentanyl or something like that.

7450
03:17:17,850 --> 03:17:21,480
This shit that they killed
prince and these these guys,

7451
03:17:22,030 --> 03:17:23,300
that's some that joy would say,

7452
03:17:23,340 --> 03:17:24,030
this is what it is.

7453
03:17:24,030 --> 03:17:24,863
The shit that killed prince,

7454
03:17:24,990 --> 03:17:29,990
they'd said it was $500,000
this company donated in Arizona.

7455
03:17:30,390 --> 03:17:33,300
Just try to stop this
campaign to legalize.

7456
03:17:34,230 --> 03:17:36,390
That should be a fucking felony.

7457
03:17:36,500 --> 03:17:37,333
Yeah.

7458
03:17:37,440 --> 03:17:37,981
Any kind of,

7459
03:17:37,981 --> 03:17:39,030
anything that could can,

7460
03:17:39,080 --> 03:17:42,270
can be considered a crime on humanity.

7461
03:17:42,300 --> 03:17:43,590
If you can prove that,

7462
03:17:43,860 --> 03:17:45,640
that should be a fucking felon.

7463
03:17:46,150 --> 03:17:47,610
You can't just do that shit.

7464
03:17:47,790 --> 03:17:48,810
That's a crime.

7465
03:17:48,930 --> 03:17:49,763
People are people.

7466
03:17:49,800 --> 03:17:54,800
People are fucking dying and getting
crazy off these prescription drugs and no

7467
03:17:54,811 --> 03:17:55,620
one says shit.

7468
03:17:55,620 --> 03:17:56,610
Look at tobacco.

7469
03:17:56,760 --> 03:17:58,110
Nobody say shit.

7470
03:17:58,200 --> 03:17:59,100
Look at alcohol.

7471
03:17:59,160 --> 03:18:00,150
No one says shit.

7472
03:18:00,390 --> 03:18:01,223
Then God,

7473
03:18:01,320 --> 03:18:02,520
but damn.

7474
03:18:04,140 --> 03:18:04,720
And what that,

7475
03:18:04,720 --> 03:18:05,360
no shit.

7476
03:18:05,360 --> 03:18:06,420
We're going to get out of here.

7477
03:18:06,421 --> 03:18:07,620
I got to do a spot at the store,

7478
03:18:07,621 --> 03:18:07,980
so I gotta.

7479
03:18:07,980 --> 03:18:09,660
I gotta wrap this bitch
up and bring it home,

7480
03:18:10,200 --> 03:18:11,760
but I'm fun times.

7481
03:18:11,770 --> 03:18:12,603
Boy.

7482
03:18:12,990 --> 03:18:17,130
Finally kid live San Jose Thursday
and then Braya and Oxnard in October.

7483
03:18:17,790 --> 03:18:18,421
Where's the schedule?

7484
03:18:18,421 --> 03:18:18,870
You guys got?

7485
03:18:18,870 --> 03:18:21,930
Jack k.com t fat k.com man,

7486
03:18:21,931 --> 03:18:24,150
I really think you should
come up with the clothes.

7487
03:18:24,470 --> 03:18:25,650
16 Mil site.

7488
03:18:26,110 --> 03:18:28,140
I'll be in Decatur,

7489
03:18:28,170 --> 03:18:28,801
Alabama.

7490
03:18:28,801 --> 03:18:30,630
The Saturday 10th planet,

7491
03:18:30,631 --> 03:18:30,991
Decatur,

7492
03:18:30,991 --> 03:18:31,471
Alabama.

7493
03:18:31,471 --> 03:18:33,210
This Saturday we found a,

7494
03:18:33,240 --> 03:18:34,140
Jamie found something.

7495
03:18:34,141 --> 03:18:38,040
16 million prescriptions
was in 1999 and 99

7496
03:18:41,110 --> 03:18:41,760
that's fine.

7497
03:18:41,760 --> 03:18:42,450
3 million.

7498
03:18:42,450 --> 03:18:43,400
I had to laugh at that,

7499
03:18:43,600 --> 03:18:44,430
but I was,

7500
03:18:44,430 --> 03:18:47,160
how many people are using
those 16 million prescriptions?

7501
03:18:47,170 --> 03:18:48,100
Like how many prescriptions?

7502
03:18:48,100 --> 03:18:49,450
Like how long has the prescription last?

7503
03:18:49,451 --> 03:18:50,920
Do you get one every three months?

7504
03:18:51,310 --> 03:18:51,531
You know,

7505
03:18:51,531 --> 03:18:52,031
what does that mean?

7506
03:18:52,031 --> 03:18:53,800
That a person gets four
prescriptions a year,

7507
03:18:53,801 --> 03:18:58,801
so you divide that by four went to
eight I think you get fit in days.

7508
03:19:00,220 --> 03:19:01,390
It's every 30 days,

7509
03:19:01,391 --> 03:19:01,991
right when you need them.

7510
03:19:01,991 --> 03:19:03,970
I think if when you get
prescribed hold on son,

7511
03:19:04,000 --> 03:19:05,230
just stop the nonsense.

7512
03:19:05,231 --> 03:19:06,190
If you're hooked on Adderall,

7513
03:19:06,191 --> 03:19:07,410
you're taking that shit every day.

7514
03:19:07,440 --> 03:19:07,540
Yeah.

7515
03:19:07,540 --> 03:19:09,770
What the doctor's not giving
them to you to use it earlier,

7516
03:19:10,420 --> 03:19:12,340
I was on Adderall when
I was in high school.

7517
03:19:12,370 --> 03:19:12,581
Yeah.

7518
03:19:12,581 --> 03:19:14,020
Now that you get it every day.

7519
03:19:14,140 --> 03:19:14,590
Yeah.

7520
03:19:14,590 --> 03:19:17,860
I know a guy who has an
Adderall patch hit a pastoral,

7521
03:19:17,861 --> 03:19:19,270
all pals or and patch.

7522
03:19:19,271 --> 03:19:20,290
It was a riddle and passionate.

7523
03:19:20,291 --> 03:19:21,340
They gave him PROZAC.

7524
03:19:21,370 --> 03:19:22,203
Pennies on another,

7525
03:19:22,450 --> 03:19:23,170
another level.

7526
03:19:23,170 --> 03:19:23,311
No,

7527
03:19:23,311 --> 03:19:24,144
it was a patch.

7528
03:19:24,160 --> 03:19:24,910
It was a patch.

7529
03:19:24,910 --> 03:19:26,020
They gave them a patch.

7530
03:19:26,220 --> 03:19:28,930
It was some sort of easy
or Prozac or Ritalin,

7531
03:19:29,920 --> 03:19:31,000
but he was on Adderall as well.

7532
03:19:31,001 --> 03:19:32,200
We tried a bunch of different things,

7533
03:19:32,201 --> 03:19:32,891
but he was on Adderall,

7534
03:19:32,891 --> 03:19:33,430
z cool.

7535
03:19:33,430 --> 03:19:33,971
Every day.

7536
03:19:33,971 --> 03:19:34,391
Very cool.

7537
03:19:34,391 --> 03:19:34,721
Very cool.

7538
03:19:34,721 --> 03:19:35,440
But he was,

7539
03:19:35,440 --> 03:19:37,510
he was struggling with fatigue issues.

7540
03:19:37,720 --> 03:19:38,800
He's like a not a,

7541
03:19:38,860 --> 03:19:41,950
not a vibrant guy taking a
lot of naps during the day.

7542
03:19:42,250 --> 03:19:42,641
I don't know.

7543
03:19:42,641 --> 03:19:43,340
I don't think he did it.

7544
03:19:43,340 --> 03:19:43,550
He's,

7545
03:19:43,550 --> 03:19:43,781
he's,

7546
03:19:43,781 --> 03:19:44,321
he hustles.

7547
03:19:44,321 --> 03:19:44,711
He works,

7548
03:19:44,711 --> 03:19:46,300
but I think he was having some problems.

7549
03:19:46,310 --> 03:19:47,143
Accessible dude.

7550
03:19:47,300 --> 03:19:47,680
Yeah,

7551
03:19:47,680 --> 03:19:48,130
yeah,

7552
03:19:48,130 --> 03:19:48,371
yeah.

7553
03:19:48,371 --> 03:19:49,550
Real successful dad

7554
03:19:51,160 --> 03:19:51,993
this weekend.

7555
03:19:52,250 --> 03:19:53,980
He drives a Prius

7556
03:19:55,730 --> 03:19:56,563
Tesla.

7557
03:19:56,630 --> 03:19:56,950
Uh,

7558
03:19:56,950 --> 03:19:58,330
but he was on it every day.

7559
03:19:58,331 --> 03:19:58,720
Jamie.

7560
03:19:58,720 --> 03:20:00,450
They do prescribe it for
some people every day.

7561
03:20:01,000 --> 03:20:01,660
I didn't,

7562
03:20:01,660 --> 03:20:03,010
I wasn't saying that they don't prescribe.

7563
03:20:03,040 --> 03:20:04,540
I thought they didn't
prescribe it every day.

7564
03:20:04,760 --> 03:20:05,680
I think just a refill.

7565
03:20:05,681 --> 03:20:07,030
It'd be 30 I think.

7566
03:20:07,280 --> 03:20:09,660
I think there's a lot of
people that take it every day

7567
03:20:11,360 --> 03:20:13,630
because they're not going to give
you fucking hundred 20 pills.

7568
03:20:13,790 --> 03:20:14,710
No Slang.

7569
03:20:14,740 --> 03:20:15,580
I think they do.

7570
03:20:15,820 --> 03:20:16,601
I think they do.

7571
03:20:16,601 --> 03:20:18,040
And I think if you take one a day,

7572
03:20:18,041 --> 03:20:18,874
like that's how they,

7573
03:20:18,880 --> 03:20:20,140
I think they can do it.

7574
03:20:20,290 --> 03:20:23,890
I don't think it's thought of as being
like the danger that it is fucking idiot

7575
03:20:23,891 --> 03:20:26,350
or at least most people like you or I,

7576
03:20:26,351 --> 03:20:27,490
they think it's going to help you,

7577
03:20:27,491 --> 03:20:30,640
but kids are snorting that
shit and taking classes.

7578
03:20:31,120 --> 03:20:33,070
The frills for testing
of people abused it.

7579
03:20:33,071 --> 03:20:33,821
I wasn't saying that.

7580
03:20:33,821 --> 03:20:34,110
I know.

7581
03:20:34,110 --> 03:20:34,990
Have you ever taken it?

7582
03:20:35,020 --> 03:20:35,500
I take it.

7583
03:20:35,500 --> 03:20:35,721
No,

7584
03:20:35,721 --> 03:20:36,790
I'm not getting nothing done.

7585
03:20:36,791 --> 03:20:37,690
I will chat.

7586
03:20:37,691 --> 03:20:38,800
You're fucking air.

7587
03:20:38,920 --> 03:20:40,170
Ah,

7588
03:20:40,480 --> 03:20:41,313
nothing done.

7589
03:20:41,410 --> 03:20:43,090
Real chatty Kathy on that shit.

7590
03:20:43,390 --> 03:20:44,860
I didn't want to it in college.

7591
03:20:44,861 --> 03:20:46,090
I mean I got nothing done.

7592
03:20:46,120 --> 03:20:46,740
That's hilarious.

7593
03:20:46,740 --> 03:20:46,870
Oh,

7594
03:20:46,870 --> 03:20:47,150
come on.

7595
03:20:47,150 --> 03:20:47,983
Like what are you doing?

7596
03:20:48,010 --> 03:20:48,200
Hey,

7597
03:20:48,200 --> 03:20:48,400
we're,

7598
03:20:48,400 --> 03:20:50,440
we're just fucking going off.

7599
03:20:50,441 --> 03:20:51,340
Oh my God.

7600
03:20:51,400 --> 03:20:52,233
That idea.

7601
03:20:52,450 --> 03:20:53,710
Well that's it.

7602
03:20:53,830 --> 03:20:54,663
Um,

7603
03:20:54,700 --> 03:20:55,540
Joe Schilling,

7604
03:20:55,570 --> 03:20:56,141
Joe Schilling,

7605
03:20:56,141 --> 03:20:57,790
one eight seven on Twitter.

7606
03:20:58,090 --> 03:21:00,760
Joe Underscores Schilling on Instagram,

7607
03:21:00,880 --> 03:21:01,450
correct?

7608
03:21:01,450 --> 03:21:01,980
Yes sir.

7609
03:21:01,980 --> 03:21:02,800
I'm on the ball.

7610
03:21:02,800 --> 03:21:03,340
Boom.

7611
03:21:03,340 --> 03:21:04,240
On the bond.

7612
03:21:04,330 --> 03:21:05,230
The Brendan Schaub.

7613
03:21:05,231 --> 03:21:06,370
Don't call them Brandon.

7614
03:21:06,630 --> 03:21:07,440
Brendan,

7615
03:21:07,440 --> 03:21:08,273
Brendan.

7616
03:21:08,470 --> 03:21:09,303
I'm sorry about that.

7617
03:21:09,490 --> 03:21:10,360
I know I fucked up.

7618
03:21:10,970 --> 03:21:11,803
Fucked up.

7619
03:21:12,640 --> 03:21:14,800
We hope everybody in New York's okay,

7620
03:21:14,830 --> 03:21:15,521
Bryan Karens.

7621
03:21:15,521 --> 03:21:16,120
Okay.

7622
03:21:16,120 --> 03:21:18,160
And appreciate the fuck ID people.

7623
03:21:18,161 --> 03:21:19,330
Next one we can do with these.

7624
03:21:19,420 --> 03:21:20,160
We'll do it.

7625
03:21:20,160 --> 03:21:20,440
I don't know.

7626
03:21:20,440 --> 03:21:21,550
Is there an one next week?

7627
03:21:21,920 --> 03:21:22,753
Because they're one next week.

7628
03:21:23,410 --> 03:21:25,510
When's the Cyborg fight next?

7629
03:21:26,010 --> 03:21:27,250
Firing a bitch next week.

7630
03:21:27,430 --> 03:21:28,263
Okay.

7631
03:21:28,430 --> 03:21:30,340
We gotta do one of the Canelo fight.

7632
03:21:31,060 --> 03:21:32,040
Don't we miss the spoiler

7633
03:21:34,540 --> 03:21:35,373
alert?

7634
03:21:36,720 --> 03:21:37,650
Canelo fight tonight,

7635
03:21:48,880 --> 03:21:49,713
okay.

7636
03:21:55,520 --> 03:21:55,590
Okay.
