1
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:04,690
Like midnight express.

2
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:05,101
God Damn,

3
00:00:05,101 --> 00:00:05,934
it's been so long.

4
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:07,690
It's a in through the nose,

5
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:10,390
out through the mouth and
it's a lot of belly breathing.

6
00:00:10,391 --> 00:00:11,460
It's all about the diaphragm.

7
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:15,460
You got to go Hixon Gracie

8
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:19,870
second.

9
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:20,110
I can't

10
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:20,620
really do that.

11
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:22,600
His son would you like to
get a cron can do it too.

12
00:00:22,601 --> 00:00:22,781
Yeah,

13
00:00:22,781 --> 00:00:23,291
it's bad ass.

14
00:00:23,291 --> 00:00:24,550
I saw a video of him do it online.

15
00:00:24,551 --> 00:00:25,450
Does it just like his father.

16
00:00:25,451 --> 00:00:26,130
It's pretty freaky.

17
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:26,320
Yeah,

18
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:26,981
it's pretty awesome.

19
00:00:26,981 --> 00:00:27,900
I'd watch just anybody.

20
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:31,870
Meanwhile I've lacked the discipline
to get that far down the road and the

21
00:00:31,871 --> 00:00:33,520
breathing probably on a yoga.

22
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:33,851
Yeah,

23
00:00:33,851 --> 00:00:35,470
that's what it is or
Marillo talking about it.

24
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:36,430
It's deep shit man.

25
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:37,180
And um,

26
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:37,421
you know,

27
00:00:37,421 --> 00:00:37,901
we had a,

28
00:00:37,901 --> 00:00:41,710
my friend Aubrey was on the other
day and he was talking about shamonic

29
00:00:41,711 --> 00:00:42,200
breathing,

30
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,830
which they do intense bursts
of in through the nose,

31
00:00:44,831 --> 00:00:45,431
out through the mouth,

32
00:00:45,431 --> 00:00:45,871
into the nose,

33
00:00:45,871 --> 00:00:46,390
out the mouth.

34
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:48,130
And if you do it for like 10 15 minutes,

35
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:49,720
apparently you reached this like crazy,

36
00:00:49,721 --> 00:00:50,350
lucid,

37
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:51,430
euphoric state.

38
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:52,001
Sorry.

39
00:00:52,001 --> 00:00:53,710
Oxygenated your blood or whatever.

40
00:00:53,711 --> 00:00:56,170
Very strange psychedelic
experience apparently.

41
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:57,393
Yeah,

42
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,050
that's right.

43
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:00,010
You dirty fucks.

44
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:03,700
This podcast is brought to you
by [inaudible] dot com go to o,

45
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,800
n n I t use a code name,

46
00:01:05,801 --> 00:01:09,580
Rogan and save yourself 10%
off any and all supplements.

47
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:11,890
We just added a new item.

48
00:01:11,891 --> 00:01:13,330
It's called a t plus.

49
00:01:13,331 --> 00:01:14,800
It's a testosterone supplement.

50
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:15,731
Yeah,

51
00:01:15,731 --> 00:01:18,760
there's a lot of fuckery in the
world of testosterone supplements.

52
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:23,500
So we looked into it for a long time to
try to find out is there an effective

53
00:01:23,501 --> 00:01:26,320
blend of nutrients that can
increase your testosterone?

54
00:01:26,321 --> 00:01:29,410
Because there's a lot of different things
that are out there on the market that

55
00:01:29,411 --> 00:01:30,520
may or may not work.

56
00:01:30,521 --> 00:01:35,521
And the only thing that we could find for
sure that worked is all the stuff that

57
00:01:35,531 --> 00:01:37,960
we put into this t plus formula.

58
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:38,441
I'm,

59
00:01:38,441 --> 00:01:40,870
one of them is magnesium disparic acid,

60
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:45,670
which has been shown in at least one study
to increase free testosterone by 42%.

61
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:46,570
Um,

62
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:47,320
there's the,

63
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,780
there's magnesium and the zinc Zma.

64
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:50,220
Yeah.

65
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:50,500
You know,

66
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:54,310
I read into that Zma and one of the
things that it seems to increase

67
00:01:54,311 --> 00:01:54,971
testosterone,

68
00:01:54,971 --> 00:01:56,380
it just being completely honest about it.

69
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:56,680
I,

70
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,071
and I,

71
00:01:57,071 --> 00:01:57,910
I take the product,

72
00:01:58,450 --> 00:01:58,780
um,

73
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:03,190
they say that the way can help you is
that it can give you deep sleep and if you

74
00:02:03,191 --> 00:02:04,390
are lacking in zinc,

75
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,250
then it can make up for that.

76
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:09,430
And boost testosterone is in
people who are lacking in zinc.

77
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:11,980
But apparently zinc is
just like really essential.

78
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,410
So a that just shows me that,

79
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,273
um,

80
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,240
zinc is,

81
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:20,050
it's a very important aspect of
normal health to keep you functioning,

82
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:20,620
but it don't,

83
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:23,320
I don't know if it necessarily
raises your testosterone.

84
00:02:23,321 --> 00:02:23,540
It's,

85
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:26,020
it seems to only raise it and
people who are lacking in sync.

86
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:27,060
Um,

87
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:27,893
uh,

88
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:30,830
I was saying you suna [inaudible] um,

89
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:31,180
uh,

90
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:32,320
elevates your natural,

91
00:02:32,321 --> 00:02:33,480
I know I fucked that up.

92
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:36,220
Elevates your natural dopamine levels,

93
00:02:36,221 --> 00:02:39,820
which is a key neurotransmitter
involved in hormone hormone synthesis.

94
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:41,920
And we got this stuff called Long Jack.

95
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:46,930
It's like Euro Como long if Phila and
helps your body enhanced the synthesis of

96
00:02:46,931 --> 00:02:48,970
various androgens produced by the testes,

97
00:02:48,971 --> 00:02:50,020
which is your sac,

98
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,480
Aka your nuts son.

99
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:53,170
Um,

100
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:54,580
so what we did is we just,

101
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:59,700
we formulated all of this shit that
we could put together that work in a

102
00:02:59,801 --> 00:03:01,390
synergistic fashion to,

103
00:03:01,391 --> 00:03:01,720
uh,

104
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,760
to help elevate your body's testosterone.

105
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:07,780
The good thing about this is that this
is not something that your body would

106
00:03:07,781 --> 00:03:12,781
become dependent upon and also that it
doesn't impede your natural production of

107
00:03:13,481 --> 00:03:14,314
testosterone.

108
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:16,000
One of the issues with,

109
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:16,390
um,

110
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:19,300
if you take a testosterone replacement,

111
00:03:19,301 --> 00:03:23,110
like I take a testosterone
cream and I rub it on.

112
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:24,010
And when you do,

113
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:26,860
the problem with doing
that is if you do too much,

114
00:03:26,861 --> 00:03:28,090
if you have too much of it,

115
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,230
like if you get crazy,

116
00:03:29,231 --> 00:03:32,170
like there's an issue
with MMA fighters where,

117
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:32,690
um,

118
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:34,630
they're on testosterone
replacement therapy.

119
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:35,021
Okay.

120
00:03:35,021 --> 00:03:35,260
And the,

121
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:36,220
the real issue is,

122
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:36,611
okay,

123
00:03:36,611 --> 00:03:39,550
well why are they lacking in testosterone
or they're lacking testosterone cause

124
00:03:39,551 --> 00:03:41,560
they did steroids and then they're nuts.

125
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:45,190
Shutdown because that's what happens
when you do steroids and not shut down.

126
00:03:45,191 --> 00:03:46,780
Then you can go to the
doctor and the doctor says,

127
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:46,901
oh,

128
00:03:46,901 --> 00:03:48,820
well you're low on testosterone
and you look at them and you go,

129
00:03:48,821 --> 00:03:49,241
wait a minute,

130
00:03:49,241 --> 00:03:50,560
what the fuck is going on here?

131
00:03:50,561 --> 00:03:53,230
This guy's a gorilla and
he's low on testosterone.

132
00:03:53,231 --> 00:03:54,064
What is happening here?

133
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:55,510
So there's that.

134
00:03:55,511 --> 00:03:57,340
And then there's also people
that start to get older.

135
00:03:57,341 --> 00:03:57,911
Like myself,

136
00:03:57,911 --> 00:03:58,840
I'm 45 years old.

137
00:03:58,841 --> 00:03:59,890
At a certain point in time,

138
00:03:59,891 --> 00:04:03,250
your body is just not going to produce
the same level of hormones is before.

139
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,590
And there's two ways about it.

140
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:05,861
You know,

141
00:04:05,861 --> 00:04:10,861
you can either add testosterone to your
system or do something like this stuff.

142
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:12,520
I have not started this,

143
00:04:12,521 --> 00:04:13,930
but I'm going to start trying this.

144
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:14,923
Um,

145
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:16,210
this isn't Zma.

146
00:04:16,211 --> 00:04:17,650
This is something completely different.

147
00:04:17,651 --> 00:04:17,741
Well,

148
00:04:17,741 --> 00:04:19,060
it does have some magnesium in it,

149
00:04:19,061 --> 00:04:21,250
but it has magnesium aspartic acid,

150
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:24,190
which has been shown in
actual clinical studies.

151
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:25,750
It's the key ingredient and Zma.

152
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:29,410
But it's been shown in clinical studies
that it actually can this one particular

153
00:04:29,411 --> 00:04:30,010
aspect of it.

154
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:31,750
So will this still do the frothy loads?

155
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,570
I believe your loads
will stay frothy long.

156
00:04:34,571 --> 00:04:36,340
Jack also builds up frothy loads,

157
00:04:36,341 --> 00:04:38,590
long jack or something that
people have been using.

158
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:39,100
It's a,

159
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:42,010
some of the root or some shit it's people
have been using for a long time to,

160
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,330
to boost testosterone.

161
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:43,991
So,

162
00:04:43,991 --> 00:04:44,430
um,

163
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:45,690
we're the pee wee,

164
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,960
we Beta test this on people.

165
00:04:46,961 --> 00:04:49,240
They've had great results and
we're super excited about it.

166
00:04:49,241 --> 00:04:50,460
So we think that a,

167
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:51,251
there's something to it.

168
00:04:51,251 --> 00:04:52,390
We think that this is a,

169
00:04:52,391 --> 00:04:53,080
um,

170
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:53,640
uh,

171
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:57,730
a supplement that the most important
thing is that it doesn't fuck with your

172
00:04:57,731 --> 00:05:00,280
body's natural ability
to produce testosterone,

173
00:05:00,281 --> 00:05:01,990
which the shit that I'm on does,

174
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,340
my balls would shut down.

175
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:04,173
Basically.

176
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:04,930
I said done.

177
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:05,211
I don't know.

178
00:05:05,211 --> 00:05:07,420
He's not really because I
don't take that much of it.

179
00:05:07,421 --> 00:05:08,231
I take a gram,

180
00:05:08,231 --> 00:05:11,260
it's like a what you would put on a
tube of toothpaste and I rub it on,

181
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:13,270
sort of know my shoulders,

182
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:13,751
shoulders,

183
00:05:13,751 --> 00:05:14,381
and your upper chest,

184
00:05:14,381 --> 00:05:14,651
excuse me,

185
00:05:14,651 --> 00:05:15,484
a little bit of test.

186
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:16,271
Not too much,

187
00:05:16,271 --> 00:05:16,750
but,

188
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:19,450
but a lot of guys like I don't
want to be like this guy.

189
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:21,400
I got my wife pregnant twice while on it,

190
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:22,360
but,

191
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,830
so that means my boss still work.

192
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:25,030
But I know a lot of dudes,

193
00:05:25,031 --> 00:05:25,990
they're balls don't work anymore.

194
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:26,760
They're done.

195
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,290
You know,

196
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:29,770
and there's some shit
you can take like Hcg,

197
00:05:29,771 --> 00:05:30,510
I believe.

198
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:30,670
Yeah.

199
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:32,050
You can build your level of juvenile.

200
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:32,860
Yeah.

201
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:33,693
But it takes time.

202
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,001
Well,

203
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:34,601
what this is,

204
00:05:34,601 --> 00:05:34,751
yeah,

205
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:34,931
this,

206
00:05:34,931 --> 00:05:35,171
this,

207
00:05:35,171 --> 00:05:38,710
this video which you're looking at
right now is ridiculous and was more

208
00:05:38,711 --> 00:05:42,910
ridiculous until I stepped in
because at the end of the video,

209
00:05:42,911 --> 00:05:43,180
there's,

210
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:45,860
and thank you to the rogue and board and
all my freaks in the rogue and board.

211
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:46,150
Uh,

212
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:48,940
and I forgot which
individual pointed it out.

213
00:05:48,941 --> 00:05:49,774
I forgive me,

214
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,040
but it's actually in the current farm.

215
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:51,874
This was,

216
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:53,200
which is the current farmers,

217
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:55,320
my area fruit problem.

218
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:57,230
Yeah.

219
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:58,041
Well the video is like,

220
00:05:58,041 --> 00:06:01,220
he's getting a stretch on and then he
lifts and then afterwards he was at the

221
00:06:01,221 --> 00:06:04,340
bar with these chicks and they were
pointing about how cheesy it was.

222
00:06:04,341 --> 00:06:04,701
And I was like,

223
00:06:04,701 --> 00:06:05,511
oh my God.

224
00:06:05,511 --> 00:06:06,344
No,

225
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:10,400
because I always shit on this Stephen
Dorff commercial where he's smoking

226
00:06:10,401 --> 00:06:10,791
cigarettes,

227
00:06:10,791 --> 00:06:11,121
by the way.

228
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:12,200
This is in black and white,

229
00:06:12,201 --> 00:06:12,711
which again,

230
00:06:12,711 --> 00:06:13,700
makes it extra douchey.

231
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,450
That does make it extra duty.

232
00:06:15,451 --> 00:06:15,590
She,

233
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:15,821
oh,

234
00:06:15,821 --> 00:06:17,190
go ahead and start your,

235
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:19,523
here's your,

236
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,401
here's your car,

237
00:06:20,401 --> 00:06:21,230
your queer.

238
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:21,920
Um,

239
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,191
the,

240
00:06:22,191 --> 00:06:22,670
uh,

241
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:26,300
the video at the end was him at the
bar with two chicks and the music's

242
00:06:26,301 --> 00:06:26,901
horrible.

243
00:06:26,901 --> 00:06:27,231
And I'm like,

244
00:06:27,231 --> 00:06:28,130
oh my God,

245
00:06:28,131 --> 00:06:28,964
stop.

246
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,370
It was way worse than
Stephen Dorff commercial.

247
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:32,570
And it was like,

248
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:33,450
I can't be involved in this.

249
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:37,400
We also had to remove the word swagger.

250
00:06:37,401 --> 00:06:38,780
Someone also pointed out your,

251
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:39,260
yeah,

252
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:40,870
the word swagger was involved.

253
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:42,253
Exactly.

254
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:43,431
I was like,

255
00:06:43,431 --> 00:06:44,264
Jesus Christ,

256
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:48,560
you're selling whenever you're involved
in anything enhancing like anything,

257
00:06:48,561 --> 00:06:49,430
a male enhancing,

258
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:53,560
you have to really try hard to
avoid the stigma of Douchey lists.

259
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:55,550
Cause it's so easy to catch,

260
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:57,290
so easy to catch.

261
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:57,760
It's like,

262
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:57,880
well,

263
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,170
it's like being in a daycare
and not getting sick.

264
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,880
You're in a situation where you know,

265
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,130
you gotta you gotta you gotta
be real careful on that.

266
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:07,003
Exactly.

267
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:07,880
Anyway,

268
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,800
plenty of shit to buy it on a.com.

269
00:07:09,801 --> 00:07:14,160
It's essentially a performance enhancing
website and that's really what it is.

270
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:15,080
All legal stuff.

271
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:16,850
But it's all about Alpha brain,

272
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:17,271
which,

273
00:07:17,271 --> 00:07:17,451
uh,

274
00:07:17,451 --> 00:07:18,950
I take for every podcast.

275
00:07:18,951 --> 00:07:20,570
I take four of these for every podcast.

276
00:07:20,571 --> 00:07:22,340
I take four of them before every UFC.

277
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:24,410
I take four of them before comedy shows.

278
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:24,980
Um,

279
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:25,280
it's,

280
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:25,551
it's,

281
00:07:25,551 --> 00:07:30,260
these are essential building blocks
for human neurotransmitters and it can

282
00:07:30,261 --> 00:07:32,180
enhance the way your mind functions.

283
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:33,231
For me,

284
00:07:33,231 --> 00:07:34,064
it's an essential,

285
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:34,551
you know,

286
00:07:34,551 --> 00:07:35,420
I've heard people say,

287
00:07:35,421 --> 00:07:35,691
oh,

288
00:07:35,691 --> 00:07:36,640
I don't feel anything on,

289
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:36,861
I mean,

290
00:07:36,861 --> 00:07:37,730
you might not,

291
00:07:37,731 --> 00:07:39,110
I don't know how your body works.

292
00:07:39,111 --> 00:07:40,880
Everybody's body's completely different.

293
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:43,070
People have different
responses to alcohol.

294
00:07:43,071 --> 00:07:45,860
People have different responses
to foods and allergies.

295
00:07:45,861 --> 00:07:47,000
And for me,

296
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:48,020
it's a must have.

297
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:48,450
Um,

298
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:48,651
I'm,

299
00:07:48,651 --> 00:07:50,420
I'm a huge believer in nootropics.

300
00:07:50,421 --> 00:07:53,090
I've been a fan of him long before
I ever got involved in Alpha brain.

301
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:54,860
I took a bill Romanowski stuff,

302
00:07:54,861 --> 00:07:56,060
which is called neuro one.

303
00:07:57,140 --> 00:08:01,400
And Bill Romanowski created it because
he was having real issues with massive

304
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:05,330
headaches and head problems after all
the concussions that he took playing

305
00:08:05,331 --> 00:08:05,990
football.

306
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:07,370
So he got involved in,

307
00:08:07,371 --> 00:08:07,640
uh,

308
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,473
nutrients,

309
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:09,080
um,

310
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:09,381
to,

311
00:08:09,381 --> 00:08:09,620
uh,

312
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:10,730
to make his mind healthier.

313
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:11,301
And,

314
00:08:11,301 --> 00:08:11,450
uh,

315
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:12,620
I took some of his stuff,

316
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:13,820
found out about no name,

317
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,260
remember no name from Alison,

318
00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:16,020
known name,

319
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:18,740
Sarah known him in San Francisco.

320
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:23,480
And from there I really got interested
and started just experimenting with

321
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:26,360
various different combinations of them.

322
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:28,220
And this is the best one so far from me.

323
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:30,620
Go to [inaudible] dot com
use the code name Brogan,

324
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,780
save 10% and go fuck yourself.

325
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:33,680
Holla.

326
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:36,800
We're also a sponsored by Squarespace.

327
00:08:36,801 --> 00:08:37,460
Now this is,

328
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:39,320
this is the newest sponsor that we've got.

329
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:41,750
And if you've never been
a square per space before,

330
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,120
Squarespace is a,

331
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:44,090
it's pretty interesting.

332
00:08:44,091 --> 00:08:47,120
It's essentially a website where you,

333
00:08:47,121 --> 00:08:52,121
if you go to squarespace.com
forward slash Joe,

334
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:53,660
um,

335
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:56,790
you can sign up and
you can check this out.

336
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:57,180
It's,

337
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:02,180
it allows you to make your own
websites without being like a red band,

338
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:04,200
like a computer genius.

339
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:08,120
I've actually thought about using coder
guys just because it seems the way to go

340
00:09:08,121 --> 00:09:08,591
nowadays.

341
00:09:08,591 --> 00:09:08,920
Yeah.

342
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:11,740
Like I don't feel like doing
all the old stuff anymore.

343
00:09:11,741 --> 00:09:14,250
He nowadays like these
templates and like these like,

344
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:15,860
like build your own website.

345
00:09:15,861 --> 00:09:20,370
Things are so good that it does the
purpose that it's almost a no brainer.

346
00:09:20,371 --> 00:09:20,430
Yeah.

347
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:23,310
With someone who like
marginal intelligence,

348
00:09:23,311 --> 00:09:24,540
like a normal brain.

349
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:25,950
You can,

350
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:29,700
you can go there and you can make a dope
website that works by the way on every

351
00:09:29,701 --> 00:09:30,534
platform.

352
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,670
And it'll work on mobile
platforms as well.

353
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,260
It's really interesting shit.

354
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,770
squarespace.com forward slash Joe.

355

So use the offer code Joe
and the number two Joe too.

362

363
00:09:52,081 --> 00:09:54,180
I guess cause there's a Joe
one and that makes me sad.

364
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:54,860
Oh,

365
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:55,490
you need a change.

366
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:56,780
You need to change it to something else.

367
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,790
We're going to do Joe,

368
00:09:58,791 --> 00:09:59,540

369
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:00,380
but I'm Joe too.

370
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:01,041

371
00:10:01,041 --> 00:10:01,371

The taco Joe the gave me,

376
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:08,361
I don't really care.

377
00:10:08,361 --> 00:10:09,200
I'm an easy going guy.

378
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,700
A taco Joe Taco.

379
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:11,481
That's even harder.

385
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:20,110

like each template has hundreds
of customer customization
options that you can

392
00:10:33,131 --> 00:10:34,270

that have been made from it and you know,

402
00:10:52,991 --> 00:10:55,420
you can get kind of ideas of
how you could do your own shit.

403
00:10:55,421 --> 00:10:57,560
But it's cool because it's,

404
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:02,080

who's not some genius coder character to

I'll never do that.

485
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:24,620
Yeah,

486
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:25,100

I was reading the disaster diaries.

499
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:44,410

00:13:51,081 --> 00:13:55,280
I mean it was like you were like inside
my head with so many different aspects

504
00:13:55,281 --> 00:13:56,720
of the idea of,

505
00:13:56,721 --> 00:13:57,920
of disasters,

506
00:13:57,921 --> 00:14:00,050
the idea of taking care
of your kids and that,

507
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:04,760
that extra feeling of vulnerability that
you have now being a father as opposed

508
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:06,370
to the way you were when
you were a young man.

509
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:07,580
Just you're a whatever.

510
00:14:07,581 --> 00:14:08,414
Fuck yeah,

511
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,240
I'll be all right.

512
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:09,470
Um,

513
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:11,180
the book's called the disaster diaries,

514
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:14,870
how I learned to stop worrying
and love the apocalypse and uh,

515
00:14:14,871 --> 00:14:16,700
it's really fucking interesting stuff man.

516
00:14:16,701 --> 00:14:17,331
And you went,

517
00:14:17,331 --> 00:14:18,830
you went really deep with this.

518
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:24,010
You covered so many aspects of the whole
idea of survival and the whole idea of

519
00:14:25,431 --> 00:14:30,431
like really chaos situations
and controlling your
adrenaline and relaxing and

520
00:14:31,881 --> 00:14:36,881
how most people really have no idea
that like when the shit hits the fan,

521
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:40,100
most people are just literally
going to like shut off,

522
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:42,470
they're going to shit
their pants and shut off.

523
00:14:42,471 --> 00:14:46,220
And that is a much more
common reaction than not.

524
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,113
Totally.

525
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:47,470
Yeah.

526
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:48,650
So interesting to see that.

527
00:14:48,651 --> 00:14:49,484
Like,

528
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:50,210
you know,

529
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:52,070
a lot of people know what they don't know.

530
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:52,581
You know what I mean?

531
00:14:52,581 --> 00:14:53,030
And that's,

532
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:53,691
that was kind of,

533
00:14:53,691 --> 00:14:55,220
so one of the major,

534
00:14:55,221 --> 00:14:55,610
you know,

535
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:59,060
sort of things I took from
this book was what stress does,

536
00:14:59,420 --> 00:14:59,661
you know,

537
00:14:59,661 --> 00:15:00,201
you and I,

538
00:15:00,201 --> 00:15:00,381
you know,

539
00:15:00,381 --> 00:15:02,870
you've been in the fight game for a
long time and I'd written about the

540
00:15:02,871 --> 00:15:06,200
fighter's mind and stuff
and I was shocked at how,

541
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:07,490
you know,

542
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:10,820
the Cooper's color code wasn't
talked about in the fight game.

543
00:15:10,821 --> 00:15:11,361
You know what I mean?

544
00:15:11,361 --> 00:15:11,601
Which,

545
00:15:11,601 --> 00:15:11,781
you know,

546
00:15:11,781 --> 00:15:12,860
it's a shooting thing.

547
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:14,071
Explain to Cooper.

548
00:15:14,071 --> 00:15:14,271
So,

549
00:15:14,271 --> 00:15:15,350
so it's in the book,

550
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:16,340
the Cooper's color code,

551
00:15:16,341 --> 00:15:17,960
which anybody who does any shooting,

552
00:15:17,961 --> 00:15:18,531
we'll know about it.

553
00:15:18,531 --> 00:15:18,770
But,

554
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:19,640
but it's basically,

555
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:24,620
Jeff Cooper was a very well known farms
instructor in the 60s and he came up

556
00:15:24,621 --> 00:15:29,360
with this color code about your sort
of alertness level and you know,

557
00:15:29,361 --> 00:15:29,721
white,

558
00:15:29,721 --> 00:15:34,400
you're at home kind of off or listening
to music or watching TV and then yellow,

559
00:15:34,401 --> 00:15:36,840
you're on the street and not orange.

560
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:37,091
You're,

561
00:15:37,091 --> 00:15:37,281
you know,

562
00:15:37,281 --> 00:15:41,000
you sort of seeing maybe possible
danger and then read you're fighting.

563
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:43,550
And that was how he sort of quantified it.

564
00:15:43,551 --> 00:15:45,590
And then the Marine Corps
later come up with black,

565
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:49,430
which was the catastrophic
failure of your mind,

566
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:51,080
basically like the total breakdown.

567
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:53,390
And it was just so interesting.

568
00:15:53,391 --> 00:15:54,224
They sort of,

569
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:54,561
you know,

570
00:15:54,561 --> 00:15:58,100
I've been sort of hearing about this
anecdotally and I'd seen it with fighters.

571
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:58,640
Um,

572
00:15:58,640 --> 00:15:58,851
you know,

573
00:15:58,851 --> 00:16:02,870
guys freezing or just doing
dumb shit over and over again.

574
00:16:02,871 --> 00:16:03,200
You know,

575
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:03,891
it's not working,

576
00:16:03,891 --> 00:16:06,440
but they can't stop and they're
getting punched in the face.

577
00:16:06,441 --> 00:16:08,330
So that's definitely
not helping them there.

578
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:09,573
But you know,

579
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:10,520
the fact that,

580
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:10,761
I mean,

581
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:12,440
I'm sure some of these
trainers knew about it,

582
00:16:12,441 --> 00:16:13,790
but nobody had mentioned,

583
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:14,320
you know,

584
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:19,320
there's this huge raft of data
and research that's been done on,

585
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:20,930
on,

586
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:22,890
on stress and what it
does to your body and,

587
00:16:22,891 --> 00:16:23,151
and,

588
00:16:23,151 --> 00:16:23,511
uh,

589
00:16:23,511 --> 00:16:24,140
it wasn't,

590
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:24,500
you know,

591
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,970
really being utilized in the fight game.

592
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:29,690
I think the psychological aspect of
finding is one of the most overlooked

593
00:16:29,691 --> 00:16:31,880
aspects and it's also one
of the most important.

594
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:32,870
It's um,

595
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:36,590
you wrote about it in the fighter's mind
and there's two great books for folks,

596
00:16:36,591 --> 00:16:36,921
by the way,

597
00:16:36,921 --> 00:16:38,180
if you're a MMA fans,

598
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:39,980
the fighters hard and the fighter's mind,

599
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:40,400
uh,

600
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:43,670
both of them are written by our
friend Sam and a you actually,

601
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,320
so people know you actually fuck yourself.

602
00:16:45,321 --> 00:16:46,460
And I watched that.

603
00:16:46,461 --> 00:16:46,830
Um,

604
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:49,910
it just flipping through the channels
one day I watched that video of you and

605
00:16:49,911 --> 00:16:50,744
the Thai camp,

606
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:53,090
really a amazing video.

607
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:53,950
It was really cool.

608
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:56,090
It's followed you long
before you were an author,

609
00:16:56,091 --> 00:16:56,360
right?

610
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:56,690
Yeah.

611
00:16:56,690 --> 00:16:57,680
That was a long time ago.

612
00:16:57,681 --> 00:16:57,931
Yeah,

613
00:16:57,931 --> 00:16:58,611
it was just a kid.

614
00:16:58,611 --> 00:16:59,031
But yeah,

615
00:16:59,031 --> 00:16:59,550
it was cool.

616
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:02,580
You lived in a Thai camp
for like five months and uh,

617
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:03,010
had,

618
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:03,350
uh,

619
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:04,460
how many fights did you have fought?

620
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:05,120
One time.

621
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:08,390
And that one dude that you fought was
like this fucking karate champion.

622
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:10,020
He was obviously bad ass,

623
00:17:10,021 --> 00:17:11,870
but you out conditioned him.

624
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:12,161
Yeah.

625
00:17:12,161 --> 00:17:12,350
Yeah.

626
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:13,310
He wasn't a,

627
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:14,161
he wasn't a,

628
00:17:14,161 --> 00:17:14,970
it wasn't shameful.

629
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:15,321
The coat.

630
00:17:15,321 --> 00:17:15,531
Yeah,

631
00:17:15,531 --> 00:17:16,520
the pace and all that.

632
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:17,840
He was really good though.

633
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:18,801
Well he knocked me.

634
00:17:18,801 --> 00:17:19,430
He was good.

635
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:19,610
Yeah,

636
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:21,650
he was better then I was sharp.

637
00:17:21,651 --> 00:17:22,910
Like I remember his technique,

638
00:17:22,911 --> 00:17:23,660
my defense,

639
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:25,860
that was my first flight of any kind.

640
00:17:25,861 --> 00:17:25,990
Right.

641
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:26,481
You know what I mean?

642
00:17:26,481 --> 00:17:29,480
So like it wasn't like I had
any amateur fights and you know,

643
00:17:29,481 --> 00:17:32,360
I had friends who fought and
they couldn't even a punch.

644
00:17:32,361 --> 00:17:33,890
They were so nervous
or they couldn't kick,

645
00:17:33,891 --> 00:17:34,521
they could only punch.

646
00:17:34,521 --> 00:17:35,360
They were like robots.

647
00:17:35,361 --> 00:17:36,194
You know what they got.

648
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:36,981
And so,

649
00:17:36,981 --> 00:17:37,161
you know,

650
00:17:37,161 --> 00:17:37,401
yeah,

651
00:17:37,401 --> 00:17:38,181
I felt like shit.

652
00:17:38,181 --> 00:17:39,910
But you know my mind at all.

653
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:40,701
You fuck great man.

654
00:17:40,701 --> 00:17:41,780
I did all right.

655
00:17:41,781 --> 00:17:42,351
But I'll listen.

656
00:17:42,351 --> 00:17:45,470
I chased them around with my hands
down and then I went out like a,

657
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:46,423
like a plank.

658
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:49,990
He caught you and you watch the way

659
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:50,531
he caught you.

660
00:17:50,531 --> 00:17:51,670
That was a season fighter.

661
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:52,180
Yeah,

662
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:52,511
he did.

663
00:17:52,511 --> 00:17:53,380
He definitely,

664
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:55,060
he had a lot of experience.

665
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:55,781
It's funny,

666
00:17:55,781 --> 00:17:57,760
you know Duke Roufus just
tweeted me and he was like,

667
00:17:57,761 --> 00:17:57,941
you know,

668
00:17:57,941 --> 00:17:58,571
I really like that.

669
00:17:58,571 --> 00:18:00,370
And it's like I got a little light.

670
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:01,483
Well it's a great,

671
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:06,920
Duke is a huge [inaudible] fan and it's
a great video because it focuses on you.

672
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:11,450
This guy who wants this real true Moitai
immersion experience and that's one of

673
00:18:11,451 --> 00:18:13,070
the things that I find unique about you.

674
00:18:13,071 --> 00:18:14,980
One of the things I really always
love to talk to you about it,

675
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:17,390
it's like you're one of the rare
people that I know that just you,

676
00:18:17,391 --> 00:18:22,391
we'll just fucking go and do something
and you immerse yourself in these worlds

677
00:18:22,401 --> 00:18:25,820
that are like really precarious
and fucking dangerous and you're,

678
00:18:25,821 --> 00:18:27,200
you're really into doing that.

679
00:18:27,201 --> 00:18:29,960
You're really into taking these chances
and getting the full experience.

680
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:31,640
So that's what you did in this,

681
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:32,720
this Thai camp.

682
00:18:32,721 --> 00:18:34,370
You lived there for five months,

683
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:34,720
was that one?

684
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:34,901
Yeah,

685
00:18:34,901 --> 00:18:35,651
that's six months,

686
00:18:35,651 --> 00:18:35,921
five,

687
00:18:35,921 --> 00:18:36,311
six months,

688
00:18:36,311 --> 00:18:36,791
something in that.

689
00:18:36,791 --> 00:18:38,050
And I fought at the end and then a,

690
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:38,771
and then I bailed.

691
00:18:38,771 --> 00:18:39,720
But yeah,

692
00:18:39,721 --> 00:18:41,230
I mean I think I do,

693
00:18:41,231 --> 00:18:42,980
I do love to immerse myself and you know,

694
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:46,110
I sort of kind of do like
almost social anthropology.

695
00:18:46,111 --> 00:18:46,300
You know,

696
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:48,250
I'd go get into these other subcultures.

697
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:50,530
But one of the things I don't do is like,

698
00:18:50,531 --> 00:18:54,490
I don't really have adventures
cause I feel like adventures is,

699
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:55,201
you know,

700
00:18:55,201 --> 00:18:56,200
it's when you run out of the list,

701
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:57,820
it's when you run out
of gas in the desert,

702
00:18:57,821 --> 00:18:58,151
you know what I mean?

703
00:18:58,151 --> 00:18:59,080
It's like you fucked up,

704
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,150
you fucked up and now you
have an adventure now,

705
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:02,830
now you're in trouble.

706
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:04,540
Whereas if you plan and you,

707
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:05,860
and you got your eyes and you know,

708
00:19:05,861 --> 00:19:06,850
you cover your basis,

709
00:19:06,851 --> 00:19:08,290
you don't really have adventures,

710
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:09,580
you do cool shit,

711
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,500
but it's not dangerous and you're not,

712
00:19:11,501 --> 00:19:12,334
you know,

713
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:15,610
I think that's a semantics thing
because I call those adventures.

714
00:19:15,611 --> 00:19:15,740
Yeah,

715
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:15,880
know.

716
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:16,310
Sure.

717
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:16,790
It's,

718
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:17,111
it is.

719
00:19:17,111 --> 00:19:17,830
But I think there's a,

720
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:20,470
there's an important like kind
of context and there's a lot of,

721
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:21,491
you know,

722
00:19:21,491 --> 00:19:23,980
of course I think about having
Tanner and I also think about,

723
00:19:23,981 --> 00:19:25,490
you know guys who,

724
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:25,730
who,

725
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:26,400
who,

726
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,840
you know have too much faith in
their strength into the wild,

727
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:31,180
into the wild McCandless
in that whole scene.

728
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:31,780
Yeah.

729
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:32,051
Yeah.

730
00:19:32,051 --> 00:19:34,000
You got to that into the wild.

731
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:36,580
Drove me crazy because I'm,

732
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:38,440
this kid was supposed to be smart.

733
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:40,090
Well if you're supposed to be smart,

734
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,700
how the fuck do you
not prepare for Alaska?

735
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:43,390
Like you're,

736
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:44,223
this is quilting

737
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:44,610
here.

738
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:44,851
You know,

739
00:19:44,851 --> 00:19:46,830
the thing is he was,

740
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:47,551
listen,

741
00:19:47,551 --> 00:19:49,380
I read the book and I've
thought a lot about it and I,

742
00:19:49,381 --> 00:19:49,861
and I,

743
00:19:49,861 --> 00:19:50,131
you know,

744
00:19:50,131 --> 00:19:51,660
I've talked to guys about it and cause,

745
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:54,490
cause I was doing all the
survival stuff for disaster diary.

746
00:19:54,491 --> 00:19:59,160
So is that what this guy in Kansas who
does survival school training for the

747
00:19:59,161 --> 00:20:00,420
Sayre instructors.

748
00:20:00,421 --> 00:20:02,430
So the guys who teach survive,

749
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:02,971
evade,

750
00:20:02,971 --> 00:20:03,391
resist,

751
00:20:03,391 --> 00:20:05,730
escape school to the seals and stuff.

752
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:07,620
He takes three of those guys.

753
00:20:07,621 --> 00:20:09,390
There are instructors and
teachers in these skills.

754
00:20:09,391 --> 00:20:09,871
He's like,

755
00:20:09,871 --> 00:20:10,704
fire,

756
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:11,101
fire,

757
00:20:11,101 --> 00:20:13,770
making Flint knapping making
little trap stuff like that.

758
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:15,173
Um,

759
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:17,580
and we know we talked
about McCandless and,

760
00:20:17,581 --> 00:20:17,911
and,

761
00:20:17,911 --> 00:20:20,160
and that guy in into the wild.

762
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:21,270
And um,

763
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:26,130
I think what motivated
sort of the story was yeah,

764
00:20:26,131 --> 00:20:27,300
he was foolish,

765
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:30,210
but also he made a mistake
that locals make that,

766
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,250
so he ate something that
that makes you sick.

767
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:33,570
It looks like something you can eat.

768
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:34,950
I don't think that's true.

769
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:37,200
It wasn't the reality
that he starved to death.

770
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:37,391
Yeah,

771
00:20:37,391 --> 00:20:37,831
no he did.

772
00:20:37,831 --> 00:20:38,191
But this,

773
00:20:38,191 --> 00:20:39,011
this is what happened.

774
00:20:39,011 --> 00:20:39,844
So he got sick,

775
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:41,490
but he was too close to the edge,

776
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:42,960
so he was so he was,

777
00:20:42,961 --> 00:20:46,380
so he then he starved to death because
he was so weakened at that point.

778
00:20:46,381 --> 00:20:49,630
So he w he didn't have the supplies and
this is what Krakauer writes about and

779
00:20:49,631 --> 00:20:50,290
this is what,

780
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:51,040
so he couldn't,

781
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:53,050
he didn't have the energy
to go get food basically.

782
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:53,560
Yeah.

783
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,250
Once you get,

784
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:57,160
like if you're on the edge of survival
and you're at the caloric kind of,

785
00:20:57,161 --> 00:20:57,371
you know,

786
00:20:57,371 --> 00:20:58,930
right at the cutoff of make,

787
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,060
of eating enough and you're,

788
00:21:00,061 --> 00:21:00,640
you're in a,

789
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,040
you're dying all the time
and then you get sick,

790
00:21:03,041 --> 00:21:03,581
you're fucked.

791
00:21:03,581 --> 00:21:04,260
You know what I mean?

792
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:06,160
You're in the wild and you
have no one to help you.

793
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:09,130
So he made a mistake that
should have given them diarrhea,

794
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:10,750
but because he was so weak,

795
00:21:10,751 --> 00:21:11,410
he killed them.

796
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:12,060
Oh Wow.

797
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:14,620
And he starved to death because in
the movie they made it out that it was

798
00:21:14,621 --> 00:21:16,620
something poisonous that killed him.

799
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:17,160
It was,

800
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:17,670
yeah,

801
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:18,503
no it was,

802
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,301
but it just makes you say,

803
00:21:19,301 --> 00:21:21,880
it gives you like a little
intestinal diarrhea or whatever.

804
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:22,990
Change that in the movie.

805
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:23,341
Why,

806
00:21:23,341 --> 00:21:24,550
why don't they do shit like that?

807
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:25,531
Sean Penn,

808
00:21:25,531 --> 00:21:25,641
right.

809
00:21:25,641 --> 00:21:26,170
I don't know,

810
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:27,040
mother Fucker,

811
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:27,883
Sean.

812
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:28,720
Um,

813
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,320
but the,

814
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:29,840
in the,

815
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:30,260
somebody,

816
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:32,710
somebody told me that in the real
life he had actually starved to death,

817
00:21:32,711 --> 00:21:33,700
but I didn't know that part.

818
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:36,240
I never read the book again.

819
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:38,860
I could be wrong and this is my or
sort of recollection of the incident.

820
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:39,220
Um,

821
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:39,570
but,

822
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:39,730
and,

823
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:40,511
and how it went down.

824
00:21:40,511 --> 00:21:41,800
And I talked to this guy,

825
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:42,850
um,

826
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:43,390
uh,

827
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:46,450
John Macpherson who does these survival
stuff in Kansas and there's a lot of

828
00:21:46,451 --> 00:21:49,560
plants that are poisonous that
looked like edible cause that's,

829
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:49,841
yeah,

830
00:21:49,841 --> 00:21:51,730
that's kind of the
nature of edible plants.

831
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:52,360
And sometimes they,

832
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:52,551
you know,

833
00:21:52,551 --> 00:21:54,460
the other plants disguise themselves,

834
00:21:54,461 --> 00:21:54,851
whatever.

835
00:21:54,851 --> 00:21:55,331
You know what I mean?

836
00:21:55,331 --> 00:21:56,164
There's this,

837
00:21:56,170 --> 00:21:57,820
so you can make that
mistake pretty easily,

838
00:21:57,821 --> 00:21:58,570
I guess.

839
00:21:58,570 --> 00:21:58,931
Yeah.

840
00:21:58,931 --> 00:22:03,310
There's a group of old people that live
in an old folks home and one of the

841
00:22:03,311 --> 00:22:05,800
ladies went out and pick mushrooms
and this bitch can't see anymore.

842
00:22:05,801 --> 00:22:07,270
So she got all these poisoned mushrooms,

843
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:09,700
cooked them up for
everybody and they all died.

844
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:10,360
Wow.

845
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,770
Punch of in China,

846
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:13,120
I think it was American man.

847
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:14,650
I don't think it was a
Florida or some shit.

848
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:15,421
Yeah,

849
00:22:15,421 --> 00:22:15,940
no.

850
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:17,950
And what his point was is like,

851
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:18,320
you know,

852
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,510
if he's trying to survive,

853
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:22,030
you're trapping animals and
eating the whole animal.

854
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:22,640
Yeah.

855
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,370
Which was kind of interesting.

856
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:27,210
Getting your nutrients from like
eating the brain and eating right,

857
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:27,581
eating,

858
00:22:27,581 --> 00:22:27,761
you know,

859
00:22:27,761 --> 00:22:28,410
all the work.

860
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:30,310
He didn't know how to prepare the food.

861
00:22:30,311 --> 00:22:31,150
And he didn't also know.

862
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:32,230
He didn't know how to keep it.

863
00:22:32,231 --> 00:22:34,400
Like he fucked up the Mousse.

864
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:35,500
That's what I asked him about.

865
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:37,540
Actually it's in the book
I asked Macpherson about,

866
00:22:37,541 --> 00:22:37,721
you know,

867
00:22:37,721 --> 00:22:38,680
what you do with,

868
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:38,900
you know,

869
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:39,611
cause he in,

870
00:22:39,611 --> 00:22:40,480
in into the wild,

871
00:22:40,481 --> 00:22:43,210
he kills a moose and he doesn't
know what to do with it.

872
00:22:43,211 --> 00:22:44,810
He tries to dry it but flies.

873
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:48,970
But if you cut it just thin enough,

874
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,600
so all it is is you cut strips of in,

875
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:52,451
you need a sharp knife,

876
00:22:52,451 --> 00:22:53,290
you cut strips.

877
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:57,550
As long as it's under a
half inch or a quarter inch,

878
00:22:57,551 --> 00:22:58,001
it's in the book,

879
00:22:58,001 --> 00:22:59,350
but it's like a thick,

880
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:02,920
so it's thin sheets and you're hanging
out to dry and you get some sun.

881
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:08,160
The flies won't lay eggs in it
and it turns into Jerky Dude.

882
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:08,980
Yeah,

883
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:10,090
they do that in Mexico.

884
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:10,630
Yeah.

885
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:11,380
Buffalo.

886
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:12,610
They take these strips.

887
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,520
It's this weird technique
that I saw on Steve Rinella.

888
00:23:15,521 --> 00:23:18,460
Shell [inaudible] he takes these,

889
00:23:18,461 --> 00:23:23,461
they take these strips of meat and they
hang them over a line in the hot sun.

890
00:23:23,501 --> 00:23:23,800
Right.

891
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:26,200
Then they take them and
they smashed them up.

892
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:26,530
Right.

893
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:30,310
And then they re they put water in it
and they cook it and it's called the

894
00:23:30,311 --> 00:23:30,850
Chaka.

895
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:31,360
Right.

896
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,340
Well this is just the
preserve to make jerky.

897
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:36,700
All you do is dry it and
it's really not very edible,

898
00:23:36,701 --> 00:23:37,300
but it's me.

899
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:38,051
It'll keep you alive.

900
00:23:38,051 --> 00:23:38,261
And it's,

901
00:23:38,261 --> 00:23:38,830
yeah,

902
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:39,663
it's uh,

903
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:40,540
it's,

904
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:41,890
I didn't know Turkey was that simple.

905
00:23:41,891 --> 00:23:42,031
Like,

906
00:23:42,031 --> 00:23:42,200
you know,

907
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:44,850
you sort of think there's
something complicated and
they put a lot of spices and

908
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:45,561
you buy it.

909
00:23:45,561 --> 00:23:46,394
But um,

910
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:46,971
yeah,

911
00:23:46,971 --> 00:23:47,750
you just dry it.

912
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:49,460
And uh,

913
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:52,040
it's interesting that it's
cooked meat is more dangerous.

914
00:23:52,041 --> 00:23:54,470
Raw meats not that
dangerous for some reason.

915
00:23:54,471 --> 00:23:54,870
You know,

916
00:23:54,870 --> 00:23:56,330
he gets cooked meat,

917
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:58,880
like the Salmonella gets in it and
you die from that shit or whatever.

918
00:23:58,881 --> 00:23:59,714
But Raleigh,

919
00:23:59,870 --> 00:23:59,991
yeah.

920
00:23:59,991 --> 00:24:00,201
This,

921
00:24:00,201 --> 00:24:04,100
these guys would go out and they would
have a big hunk of raw meat and they

922
00:24:04,101 --> 00:24:08,930
would hang it under a tree with a wet
towel wrapped around it and leave it for

923
00:24:08,931 --> 00:24:09,471
the week.

924
00:24:09,471 --> 00:24:10,400
And that was their fridge.

925
00:24:10,401 --> 00:24:11,510
And they would just carve off pieces.

926
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:12,470
They cooked the pieces,

927
00:24:12,471 --> 00:24:12,651
you know,

928
00:24:12,651 --> 00:24:13,100
so once you,

929
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:13,940
once you heat it up,

930
00:24:13,941 --> 00:24:14,421
but it wouldn't,

931
00:24:14,421 --> 00:24:15,590
how rotten was it?

932
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:17,240
I don't think it was that bad.

933
00:24:17,241 --> 00:24:17,961
And where was this?

934
00:24:17,961 --> 00:24:19,490
What part of they weren't Kansas.

935
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:20,720
Jesus Christ.

936
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:21,890
Fucking crazy.

937
00:24:21,891 --> 00:24:22,251
I know.

938
00:24:22,251 --> 00:24:23,084
It's weird shit.

939
00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:23,481
But you know,

940
00:24:23,481 --> 00:24:23,751
it's like,

941
00:24:23,751 --> 00:24:25,040
it keeps it a little cool.

942
00:24:25,041 --> 00:24:25,874
And then I,

943
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:27,110
I didn't do that.

944
00:24:27,111 --> 00:24:27,681
I didn't do that.

945
00:24:27,681 --> 00:24:28,130
But that's what he,

946
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:30,170
that's what I saw them week in Kansas.

947
00:24:30,171 --> 00:24:31,780
And what is the
temperature is in November.

948
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:32,790
He knows summertime,

949
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:34,693
summertime.

950
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:36,530
So they were hunting out of
season these mother fuckers,

951
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:37,423
is that what they're doing?

952
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:38,511
He might've been,

953
00:24:38,511 --> 00:24:39,350
or the mother had like,

954
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:39,710
you know,

955
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:41,770
they might've had this
roadkill or something.

956
00:24:41,771 --> 00:24:42,710
It might not have been somewhere.

957
00:24:42,711 --> 00:24:43,341
It might've been fall.

958
00:24:43,341 --> 00:24:43,850
I don't know.

959
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:44,190
I don't know.

960
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:47,060
It was something he had done with
some guys then they live primitive.

961
00:24:47,061 --> 00:24:48,080
So they didn't have any,

962
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:49,130
uh,

963
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:49,963
steel tool.

964
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:51,210
I would imagine you could do that.

965
00:24:51,211 --> 00:24:51,910
I mean,

966
00:24:51,910 --> 00:24:52,770
when I went to your hunting,

967
00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:55,860
we hung the deer's outside
for like a couple of days,

968
00:24:55,861 --> 00:24:57,210
but it was only 12 degrees outside.

969
00:24:57,270 --> 00:24:57,590
Right.

970
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:59,280
It's like you didn't
have to worry about it,

971
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:00,240
but the,

972
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,280
the idea of like a Kansas summer.

973
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:02,800
Yeah.

974
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:05,840
Fucking deer leg with a
towel wrapped around it.

975
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,460
It's like the jungle

976
00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:10,500
that can be good for you.

977
00:25:10,501 --> 00:25:11,130
Right.

978
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:15,150
They see that I'm the most
important things to cook or
things that eat meat like

979
00:25:15,151 --> 00:25:17,790
bears and pigs like bear.

980
00:25:17,791 --> 00:25:19,450
The kidney can kill you
apparently like the kid.

981
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:20,293
He's like soup.

982
00:25:20,430 --> 00:25:21,263
I think so.

983
00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:21,660
Really?

984
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:22,441
There's something in a bear.

985
00:25:22,441 --> 00:25:22,620
You,

986
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:23,221
you cannot eat.

987
00:25:23,221 --> 00:25:23,990
It's poison.

988
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:24,530
Hmm.

989
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:25,680
It'll actually kill you dead.

990
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:26,430
Ooh.

991
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:28,770
And it's edible and like herbivores.

992
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:30,031
Well yeah,

993
00:25:30,031 --> 00:25:32,420
you can eat kidneys and other things and
you should eat them in other things and

994
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,840
a or live or maybe it's liver.

995
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:34,290
I Dunno.

996
00:25:34,290 --> 00:25:35,520
There's something that
a bear you can't eat.

997
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:36,960
Hunger would make sense.

998
00:25:36,961 --> 00:25:37,441
Yeah.

999
00:25:37,441 --> 00:25:38,430
It's the liver.

1000
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:38,791
Well,

1001
00:25:38,791 --> 00:25:39,241
if they,

1002
00:25:39,241 --> 00:25:42,260
I'm livers like bears
like some bears there,

1003
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:43,380
they eat a lot of garbage too.

1004
00:25:43,381 --> 00:25:44,580
Like you gotta be real careful.

1005
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:48,150
Apparently in New Jersey they just started
allowing people to hunt black bears

1006
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:51,440
because they have so many black bears
that are like rating garbages and getting

1007
00:25:51,441 --> 00:25:52,530
in the streets and stuff like that.

1008
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:55,650
But the issue is if you get a
bear that's been eating garbage,

1009
00:25:55,651 --> 00:25:56,730
it's going to taste like shit.

1010
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:57,270
Yeah.

1011
00:25:57,270 --> 00:25:58,890
So you're shooting this thing and it's,

1012
00:25:58,920 --> 00:25:59,251
you know,

1013
00:25:59,251 --> 00:26:00,180
you're not even going to eat it.

1014
00:26:00,181 --> 00:26:00,391
You know what,

1015
00:26:00,391 --> 00:26:01,290
I'm going to enjoy it.

1016
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:01,621
Well,

1017
00:26:01,621 --> 00:26:03,090
like the deer in Kansas there,

1018
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:05,790
they're basically grain fed cattle
because they're eating the grains and the

1019
00:26:05,791 --> 00:26:06,720
cattle are eating and stuff.

1020
00:26:06,721 --> 00:26:09,030
So they have all the cattle
issues and it's not like,

1021
00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:09,241
oh,

1022
00:26:09,241 --> 00:26:09,751
that's true.

1023
00:26:09,751 --> 00:26:10,111
Yeah,

1024
00:26:10,111 --> 00:26:10,891
and big and fat.

1025
00:26:10,891 --> 00:26:11,230
But they're,

1026
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:11,461
you know,

1027
00:26:11,461 --> 00:26:12,690
it's not like great deer meat.

1028
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:13,051
Oh,

1029
00:26:13,051 --> 00:26:13,591
that's right.

1030
00:26:13,591 --> 00:26:14,490
I didn't even think of that.

1031
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:16,110
Apparently a Alfalfa,

1032
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,990
it's like one of the
best foods for the year.

1033
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,040
And then eat Alfalfa though,

1034
00:26:19,041 --> 00:26:19,691
like super healthy.

1035
00:26:19,691 --> 00:26:24,030
It's like people will grow a whole field
of Alfalfa because just to make sure

1036
00:26:24,031 --> 00:26:25,850
the deer come in Alfalfa,

1037
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:28,410
like there's these gray areas,

1038
00:26:28,411 --> 00:26:30,570
these places called high fence operations.

1039
00:26:30,930 --> 00:26:31,621
They set it up.

1040
00:26:31,621 --> 00:26:32,640
So they kind of like,

1041
00:26:32,641 --> 00:26:33,480
Ted Nugent has one,

1042
00:26:33,481 --> 00:26:35,760
only trap all these
deer and like whatever.

1043
00:26:35,761 --> 00:26:36,241
He's gotten,

1044
00:26:36,241 --> 00:26:36,691
Michigan,

1045
00:26:36,691 --> 00:26:38,460
he's got one in Michigan and one Texas.

1046
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:40,140
She's got like in Texas,

1047
00:26:40,141 --> 00:26:41,310
I know he has 300 acres.

1048
00:26:41,311 --> 00:26:42,030
I don't know what he has.

1049
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:43,640
It's like shooting fish
in a barrel kind of.

1050
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:44,110
Yeah.

1051
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:47,670
But you know you have like a certain
amount of space and they're in there.

1052
00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:48,220
Yeah.

1053
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:48,581
You know,

1054
00:26:48,581 --> 00:26:49,720
and they're eating Alfalfa.

1055
00:26:49,721 --> 00:26:54,721
So it's like on one hand it's a smart
move here on a prime for the apocalypse.

1056
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:55,450
Yeah.

1057
00:26:55,450 --> 00:26:57,940
I mean if you have a setup like that
and you're planning for the apocalypse,

1058
00:26:57,970 --> 00:26:58,780
that's pretty dope.

1059
00:26:58,780 --> 00:26:59,830
Cause apparently mean,

1060
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:00,940
think about a deer.

1061
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:03,070
You could eat a deer for a long ass time.

1062
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:05,140
You shoot one day or you're
good for like a month,

1063
00:27:05,410 --> 00:27:06,820
right of every day.

1064
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:10,600
So if you have like a whole
property filled with them,

1065
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:11,220
that would be good.

1066
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:11,431
No,

1067
00:27:11,431 --> 00:27:14,030
I mean there's a lot of like ideal
situations and that was kind of the,

1068
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:17,310
one of the scary things about this
book was like not having the bunker.

1069
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:17,850
Right.

1070
00:27:17,850 --> 00:27:21,270
And and or do I build a bunker or where
do I build the bunker but do it in

1071
00:27:21,271 --> 00:27:22,104
Montana.

1072
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,180
Wait all the minute man,

1073
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:23,941
sites from Montana.

1074
00:27:23,941 --> 00:27:26,970
And I think what I got into
really was that Black Swan issue,

1075
00:27:26,971 --> 00:27:30,960
which is you just don't know
what the disaster is going to be.

1076
00:27:30,961 --> 00:27:32,520
You don't know if it's going to be x,

1077
00:27:32,521 --> 00:27:32,761
y,

1078
00:27:32,761 --> 00:27:33,390
or Z.

1079
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:37,110
And until you do the
bunker could be a danger.

1080
00:27:37,111 --> 00:27:39,780
It can be a crutch because
you depend on the bunker.

1081
00:27:39,781 --> 00:27:44,250
It's like you're mentally hooked to this
bunker because you put so much time and

1082
00:27:44,251 --> 00:27:44,821
money into it.

1083
00:27:44,821 --> 00:27:46,340
You're not ready to
leave when it's time to

1084
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:47,030
go.

1085
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:51,140
I think one of the most important things
that you emphasize in this book is just

1086
00:27:51,141 --> 00:27:55,670
preparing your physical body and
not just by getting in shape,

1087
00:27:55,671 --> 00:27:59,270
but by understanding stress and by putting
yourself in stressful situations and

1088
00:27:59,271 --> 00:28:01,250
making yourself sort of recover and,

1089
00:28:01,251 --> 00:28:01,490
and,

1090
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:01,691
and,

1091
00:28:01,691 --> 00:28:01,961
and,

1092
00:28:01,961 --> 00:28:02,794
and handle that.

1093
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:04,940
The inoculation to stress idea.

1094
00:28:04,941 --> 00:28:06,890
That was a really interesting
point that you brought up.

1095
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:07,501
Yeah.

1096
00:28:07,501 --> 00:28:08,100
I mean,

1097
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:08,491
that's what,

1098
00:28:08,491 --> 00:28:08,761
you know,

1099
00:28:08,761 --> 00:28:09,594
again,

1100
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:11,220
the military,

1101
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:11,580
you know,

1102
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:13,680
and even sports psychology is about,

1103
00:28:13,681 --> 00:28:13,861
you know,

1104
00:28:13,861 --> 00:28:14,700
sports psychology.

1105
00:28:14,701 --> 00:28:17,460
It's just much lower levels of stress
cause you're not scared you're going to

1106
00:28:17,461 --> 00:28:18,294
die.

1107
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:18,740
Um,

1108
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:20,400
but in an MMA fight,

1109
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:22,080
fighting Anderson Silva,

1110
00:28:22,081 --> 00:28:23,700
you might read it as though you're still,

1111
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:24,271
you know,

1112
00:28:24,271 --> 00:28:25,590
I have some of this condition black,

1113
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:27,290
if you're in Rio and
you're fighting habits,

1114
00:28:27,570 --> 00:28:27,780
right?

1115
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:28,620
The black right,

1116
00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:30,043
they have that.

1117
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:31,190
They have that chance.

1118
00:28:32,090 --> 00:28:33,170
I don't know what they're saying,

1119
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,840
but apparently saying you're going to
die calling for blood and they're all

1120
00:28:35,841 --> 00:28:36,381
yelling out,

1121
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:37,610
you're going to die in Portuguese.

1122
00:28:37,611 --> 00:28:38,110
It's like,

1123
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:38,943
Ooh,

1124
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,193
Ooh.

1125
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:43,760
They do all fucking these 18,000 of them,

1126
00:28:43,761 --> 00:28:44,101
the screen.

1127
00:28:44,101 --> 00:28:46,700
And then you're looking across the
octagon and Anderson Silva's there.

1128
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:47,713
You might think you're going,

1129
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:50,570
I might have her passion black reaction.

1130
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:50,970
Yeah.

1131
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:52,730
And we went into that a little bit,

1132
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:56,480
but explaining to people that condition
black is when your heart rate and

1133
00:28:56,481 --> 00:28:58,670
everything gets to a point where you're,

1134
00:28:58,671 --> 00:29:01,610
your adrenaline is too high
and you can't think rationally.

1135
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:02,111
So your,

1136
00:29:02,111 --> 00:29:02,831
your Amygdala,

1137
00:29:02,831 --> 00:29:06,130
which recognizes a these things
subconsciously or consciously.

1138
00:29:06,131 --> 00:29:09,730
But you see a threat and your body of
course does fight or flight right and boom

1139
00:29:09,731 --> 00:29:10,450
fills your,

1140
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:10,631
you know,

1141
00:29:10,631 --> 00:29:13,720
your body with adrenaline and
other chemicals and you're,

1142
00:29:13,721 --> 00:29:14,021
you know,

1143
00:29:14,021 --> 00:29:14,710
everything changed.

1144
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:15,521
Everything changes.

1145
00:29:15,521 --> 00:29:15,761
So your,

1146
00:29:15,761 --> 00:29:16,031
your,

1147
00:29:16,031 --> 00:29:21,031
your eyeball actually changes shape and
your fine motor skills really sell for

1148
00:29:21,761 --> 00:29:22,241
because you know,

1149
00:29:22,241 --> 00:29:24,460
your muscles will fill
up and you can have,

1150
00:29:24,490 --> 00:29:24,650
you know,

1151
00:29:24,650 --> 00:29:26,290
trouble tying things.

1152
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:27,060
There was a,

1153
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:27,260
you know,

1154
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:27,971
Navy Seals,

1155
00:29:27,971 --> 00:29:30,850
they were at the end of
a really rugged course.

1156
00:29:30,851 --> 00:29:31,900
They were trying to um,

1157
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:32,800
uh,

1158
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,150
they had to handcuff these,

1159
00:29:34,151 --> 00:29:34,331
you know,

1160
00:29:34,331 --> 00:29:35,710
what the plastic zip ties these,

1161
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:36,130
these,

1162
00:29:36,130 --> 00:29:39,700
these other trainees and the
guys who had pre threaded,

1163
00:29:39,701 --> 00:29:40,930
it had no problem.

1164
00:29:40,931 --> 00:29:43,860
The who hadn't spent minutes trying to,

1165
00:29:43,861 --> 00:29:45,840
cause even though they're navy
seals and they're bad ass,

1166
00:29:45,841 --> 00:29:46,141
like they,

1167
00:29:46,141 --> 00:29:48,870
it was just there were so
filled with adrenaline.

1168
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:51,330
It made it so hard for
them to even get that,

1169
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:51,811
the thread,

1170
00:29:51,811 --> 00:29:52,130
that little,

1171
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:52,241
well,

1172
00:29:52,241 --> 00:29:52,661
the proper,

1173
00:29:52,661 --> 00:29:53,020
you know,

1174
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:56,630
also gross movements when
you tax out those muscles.

1175
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:57,010
Yes.

1176
00:29:57,010 --> 00:29:58,590
It very hard to operate everything.

1177
00:29:58,600 --> 00:29:59,250
More skill.

1178
00:29:59,250 --> 00:29:59,641
Totally.

1179
00:29:59,641 --> 00:30:00,810
And then your,

1180
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:03,090
your cognitive ability
gets sit down and you know,

1181
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:05,580
I always think of what
Brian's story about.

1182
00:30:06,330 --> 00:30:10,290
He got mugged and he dialed a
four one one right over and over.

1183
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:10,740
Yeah,

1184
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:12,210
because I was trying to
call nine one one you know,

1185
00:30:12,211 --> 00:30:13,770
it's so like shaky that couldn't,

1186
00:30:13,771 --> 00:30:15,030
like my fingers wouldn't work.

1187
00:30:15,031 --> 00:30:16,620
I'm sitting there
staring at my phone like,

1188
00:30:16,770 --> 00:30:18,310
why is this not chick?

1189
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:18,931
Why is it,

1190
00:30:18,931 --> 00:30:20,020
what am I doing right?

1191
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:21,060
It's actually really common,

1192
00:30:21,061 --> 00:30:22,280
which is the paramedics.

1193
00:30:22,281 --> 00:30:26,130
They'll say that if it's a loved one
that's a hurt and you're losing your mind.

1194
00:30:26,610 --> 00:30:30,690
A lot of people will die cap to get the
neighbor to call nine one one because

1195
00:30:30,691 --> 00:30:32,190
they can't actually operate the phone.

1196
00:30:32,191 --> 00:30:33,024
So you think,

1197
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:33,361
oh,

1198
00:30:33,361 --> 00:30:33,991
I'll be all right.

1199
00:30:33,991 --> 00:30:34,291
You know?

1200
00:30:34,291 --> 00:30:36,990
But truth is like people get so fucked up,

1201
00:30:36,991 --> 00:30:38,310
they can't operate phone,

1202
00:30:38,311 --> 00:30:40,860
they can't dial nine one which
is you think would be impossible,

1203
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,540
but it does happen.

1204
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:45,900
We are weird animal in
the fact that we're,

1205
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:46,980
we're conscious.

1206
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:47,461
Yeah.

1207
00:30:47,461 --> 00:30:50,490
So you're kind of aware of all these
things that are happening and you're not

1208
00:30:50,491 --> 00:30:51,870
just operating on instinct.

1209
00:30:51,871 --> 00:30:55,650
Like basically every other animal on this
whole planet is just operating purely

1210
00:30:55,651 --> 00:30:56,484
on instincts.

1211
00:30:56,580 --> 00:31:00,420
We are aware of scenarios that have
taken place before and the possible

1212
00:31:00,421 --> 00:31:04,260
repercussions for those scenarios or
those all roll around in our mind,

1213
00:31:04,261 --> 00:31:08,100
a sea of possibilities and
then it can shut you down.

1214
00:31:08,130 --> 00:31:11,010
And then the whole not having
experience with stress,

1215
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:11,880
we're not,

1216
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:12,770
and that's what animals

1217
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:13,831
diffuses,

1218
00:31:13,831 --> 00:31:14,240
you know that.

1219
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,880
So the two ways you can do it,

1220
00:31:15,881 --> 00:31:16,451
our training,

1221
00:31:16,451 --> 00:31:17,470
which is like military,

1222
00:31:17,471 --> 00:31:19,630
you repeated a million times or sports,

1223
00:31:19,631 --> 00:31:20,830
you'd do it a million times.

1224
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:22,930
So even when you're
stressed out of your mind,

1225
00:31:22,931 --> 00:31:23,770
you still can do it.

1226
00:31:23,850 --> 00:31:24,360
Yeah.

1227
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:24,901
Where are your,

1228
00:31:24,901 --> 00:31:27,780
your movement is a natural move
on instead of the contract,

1229
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:30,090
securely ingrained and
you've very efficient,

1230
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:30,361
you know,

1231
00:31:30,361 --> 00:31:30,720
nurse,

1232
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,670
some nap tickly or whatever
and all that stuff.

1233
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:33,570
Or you can,

1234
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:33,811
you know,

1235
00:31:33,811 --> 00:31:36,420
have experience and that's the
inoculation against stress,

1236
00:31:36,421 --> 00:31:39,240
which if you've been
through similar things,

1237
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,070
you know,

1238
00:31:41,071 --> 00:31:42,280
this isn't going to kill you.

1239
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:43,140
You know,

1240
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:46,860
I always think about how important
it is for fighters and fatigue.

1241
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:47,903
Uh,

1242
00:31:48,090 --> 00:31:49,530
when they get so exhausted and you,

1243
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:49,890
you know,

1244
00:31:49,890 --> 00:31:52,440
the lactic acid is filling
their body and you know this,

1245
00:31:52,441 --> 00:31:52,791
cause you,

1246
00:31:52,791 --> 00:31:54,480
you roll and you and
you fight and all that,

1247
00:31:54,481 --> 00:31:56,180
but it's like you feel like you're gonna

1248
00:31:56,230 --> 00:31:56,610
die.

1249
00:31:56,610 --> 00:31:57,070
Yeah.

1250
00:31:57,070 --> 00:31:58,660
You really looking for a way out.

1251
00:31:58,750 --> 00:31:59,710
And if you,

1252
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:01,060
as long as you know your,

1253
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:02,680
if you've been through it a few times,

1254
00:32:02,681 --> 00:32:02,951
you know,

1255
00:32:02,951 --> 00:32:03,131
hey,

1256
00:32:03,131 --> 00:32:03,911
I'm not going to die.

1257
00:32:03,911 --> 00:32:07,150
That feeling that I want to die does
not mean that I am going to die.

1258
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:09,840
And so I can keep going and rest.

1259
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:12,070
That's why wrestlers are so good
at them and may because they,

1260
00:32:12,071 --> 00:32:12,371
they're,

1261
00:32:12,371 --> 00:32:14,950
they're mentally so
ready for that fatigue.

1262
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,620
And that's all wrestling really is,

1263
00:32:16,621 --> 00:32:16,910
you know,

1264
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:17,340
is,

1265
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:19,450
is managing that fatigue
and managing that push.

1266
00:32:19,451 --> 00:32:20,284
So,

1267
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,090
um,

1268
00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:24,180
and then also the exhaustion
that they get from dehydration,

1269
00:32:24,181 --> 00:32:27,390
that fatigue is the mental
toughness comes from that.

1270
00:32:27,690 --> 00:32:30,030
Do you know about this thing where
they're going to remove wrestling for the

1271
00:32:30,050 --> 00:32:30,883
weapon?

1272
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:32,740
Is that the nuttiest fucking,

1273
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:33,891
yeah,

1274
00:32:33,891 --> 00:32:35,450
it seems like it's all real political.

1275
00:32:35,451 --> 00:32:36,140
And just,

1276
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:36,351
you know,

1277
00:32:36,351 --> 00:32:37,220
feel a fucked up.

1278
00:32:37,221 --> 00:32:38,090
But it's also like the,

1279
00:32:38,091 --> 00:32:38,924
I dunno,

1280
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:40,430
sees a mess by the way.

1281
00:32:40,431 --> 00:32:41,180
I mean,

1282
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:41,451
oh yeah.

1283
00:32:41,451 --> 00:32:42,350
Well because you know racist,

1284
00:32:42,351 --> 00:32:42,771
they were like,

1285
00:32:42,771 --> 00:32:45,710
there's like a real neo Nazi background.

1286
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:46,370
The Olympic,

1287
00:32:46,370 --> 00:32:47,181
the Olympic Games.

1288
00:32:47,181 --> 00:32:47,480
Really?

1289
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:47,811
Yeah.

1290
00:32:47,811 --> 00:32:48,910
If you look at who ran it,

1291
00:32:48,911 --> 00:32:49,400
that's,

1292
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:49,961
so you don't have that,

1293
00:32:49,961 --> 00:32:52,430
that famous picture in
the 60s of those guys.

1294
00:32:52,431 --> 00:32:53,320
The black power salute.

1295
00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:54,380
You know they're wearing gloves.

1296
00:32:54,410 --> 00:32:54,830
Yes.

1297
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:58,580
Cause they didn't want their skin to
touch the hand of once they metaled of the

1298
00:32:58,581 --> 00:33:02,720
guy who was handing out the medals
because he was an affirmed neo Nazi.

1299
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:03,441
Wow.

1300
00:33:03,441 --> 00:33:05,640
So he told them to put gloves he wore,

1301
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:07,550
they wore gloves because they
didn't want to touch his skin.

1302
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,650
That's why they're wearing gloves.

1303
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:10,450
Yeah.

1304
00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:11,330
The guys in the sixth,

1305
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:15,350
it's like one of them was Austrian
and if I forget the exact thing,

1306
00:33:15,351 --> 00:33:16,101
but it was like one of them,

1307
00:33:16,101 --> 00:33:18,650
the forties and then his
successor in the 60s were like,

1308
00:33:18,651 --> 00:33:22,070
had these real like Neo
Nazi sympathies is shit.

1309
00:33:22,071 --> 00:33:25,180
So the Olympics has like some shading,

1310
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,850
this dirty business.

1311
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:27,810
It's up there.

1312
00:33:27,811 --> 00:33:28,061
I'm,

1313
00:33:28,061 --> 00:33:29,400
I'm real vague about this,

1314
00:33:29,401 --> 00:33:31,170
but wasn't there like
almost everything else,

1315
00:33:31,171 --> 00:33:35,220
but wasn't there a thing about a couple
of years ago where there was a big

1316
00:33:35,221 --> 00:33:39,120
scandal briberies and a
bunch of things in the IOC?

1317
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:41,130
I'm sure there was some sort of scandal.

1318
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:41,591
Know what I mean?

1319
00:33:41,591 --> 00:33:42,011
It's all,

1320
00:33:42,011 --> 00:33:42,231
it's,

1321
00:33:42,231 --> 00:33:43,060
it's a pretty,

1322
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:43,780
it's,

1323
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:45,820
it always ends up ruining the city,

1324
00:33:45,821 --> 00:33:49,600
costing them kajillion dollars and who
knows where the money goes to developing

1325
00:33:49,601 --> 00:33:50,030
and

1326
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:53,060
it bothers me also that the
athletes don't get money.

1327
00:33:53,370 --> 00:33:54,860
That just seems crazy.

1328
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:56,010
The idea of that,

1329
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:58,880
not giving them some sort
of a financial prize.

1330
00:33:59,390 --> 00:34:01,250
W where's all that money going?

1331
00:34:01,251 --> 00:34:03,020
It's what they're getting an opportunity.

1332
00:34:03,021 --> 00:34:06,680
They are your number one
thing that you're selling.

1333
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:07,251
Number one,

1334
00:34:07,251 --> 00:34:09,590
you're saying thing you're selling
is the performance of the athletes.

1335
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:12,950
That's number one and you're making
billions and they don't get any.

1336
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:14,900
That's fucking crazy.

1337
00:34:14,901 --> 00:34:16,100
I don't care what you call it,

1338
00:34:16,101 --> 00:34:16,934
amateur,

1339
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:17,870
but it's amateur.

1340
00:34:17,871 --> 00:34:18,680
It's amateur.

1341
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:19,820
That sounds like slavery.

1342
00:34:19,910 --> 00:34:20,840
It sounds like an onsite,

1343
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:24,770
I feel the same way about the NCAA and
football [inaudible] they're making so

1344
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:29,650
much money and the athletes are getting
compensated college athletes crazy.

1345
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:30,660
I mean this is crazy,

1346
00:34:30,890 --> 00:34:32,470
but it's like that doesn't,

1347
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:32,700
you know,

1348
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:34,820
the idea is that it's
up through and around.

1349
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:35,391
Yeah,

1350
00:34:35,391 --> 00:34:39,110
it's a proving ground and it launches
them into the net and the ideal also,

1351
00:34:39,111 --> 00:34:42,530
I think I get a little bit more
with the Ncaa because they should be

1352
00:34:42,531 --> 00:34:46,700
concentrating on their education and
this is a side aspect of it and that

1353
00:34:46,701 --> 00:34:48,140
education is building towards,

1354
00:34:48,290 --> 00:34:52,200
but I think that the idea that the
school just profits completely off of it.

1355
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:55,190
It goes to maybe the money
should go to programs,

1356
00:34:55,191 --> 00:34:59,630
maybe all the profits that should go
to the athletes and instead go to pro.

1357
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:04,630
I mean imagine how rich those schools
would be and their ability to go after

1358
00:35:04,650 --> 00:35:05,620
school dungeons and dragons,

1359
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:10,100
baroque music programs and
kind of make it to pick it.

1360
00:35:10,101 --> 00:35:10,280
Right?

1361
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,120
They should get to pick which,

1362
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,190
helping their community out.

1363
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:15,530
Think about the amount
of money that the NCAA,

1364
00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:16,430
you know,

1365
00:35:16,430 --> 00:35:20,990
creates and think about how much
benefit that could be for any community.

1366
00:35:20,991 --> 00:35:23,330
If they took like a sizeable chunk,

1367
00:35:23,331 --> 00:35:24,800
like 50% like what are the,

1368
00:35:24,801 --> 00:35:28,280
what are like hockey players just
bargain for 50% and so it was,

1369
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,430
they had more somewhere else.

1370
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:31,811
The NBA,

1371
00:35:31,811 --> 00:35:32,201
all the,

1372
00:35:32,201 --> 00:35:32,330
you know,

1373
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:33,163
the unions.

1374
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:38,140
Imagine if the NCAA football guys got
50% like people don't realize how much

1375
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:39,490
money is in college sports.

1376
00:35:39,550 --> 00:35:41,870
I didn't realize it until Joey Lane.

1377
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:42,940
Shocking.

1378
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:44,110
Like the Penn state thing.

1379
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:46,300
This sex scandal made no sense to me.

1380
00:35:46,301 --> 00:35:46,601
I was like,

1381
00:35:46,601 --> 00:35:47,770
how did this not get outed?

1382
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:48,581
That's crazy.

1383
00:35:48,581 --> 00:35:49,150
Who would,

1384
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:53,080
and then I found out how much money you
can state makes every year from their

1385
00:35:53,081 --> 00:35:55,540
football program and
from getting donations.

1386
00:35:55,930 --> 00:35:56,990
It's in the billions.

1387
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:57,311
Yeah.

1388
00:35:57,311 --> 00:35:58,144
What the alumni,

1389
00:35:58,180 --> 00:35:58,740
the spa.

1390
00:35:58,740 --> 00:35:58,981
Yeah,

1391
00:35:58,981 --> 00:35:59,151
yeah,

1392
00:35:59,151 --> 00:35:59,470
yeah.

1393
00:35:59,470 --> 00:36:00,303
It's insane.

1394
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,140
And when you get that high,

1395
00:36:02,170 --> 00:36:05,920
you're going to get people that are doing
whatever they can to keep that thing.

1396
00:36:05,921 --> 00:36:06,754
That way,

1397
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:07,713
if that,

1398
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,400
if that amount of money,

1399
00:36:09,610 --> 00:36:12,040
half of it like was just like,

1400
00:36:12,041 --> 00:36:12,311
okay,

1401
00:36:12,311 --> 00:36:12,920
these guys,

1402
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,200
essentially they're professionals.

1403
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,730
But instead of giving them the money,

1404
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,750
we're going to give it to
the community thought yeah,

1405
00:36:18,370 --> 00:36:18,850
that'd be me.

1406
00:36:18,850 --> 00:36:19,510
And it would grow.

1407
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:21,490
Keep those fat cons from getting fatter.

1408
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:22,850
Those motherfuckers,

1409
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:27,550
but rich pitches out there just stealing
from these young urban kids with good

1410
00:36:27,551 --> 00:36:28,270
legs.

1411
00:36:28,270 --> 00:36:28,691
That's right.

1412
00:36:28,691 --> 00:36:30,520
Handsome kids fuckers.

1413
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:31,360
They're given him a shot.

1414
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:31,851
I mean I,

1415
00:36:31,851 --> 00:36:32,710
I get that,

1416
00:36:32,711 --> 00:36:33,290
but somebody,

1417
00:36:33,290 --> 00:36:33,820
I don't know.

1418
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:34,090
Yeah.

1419
00:36:34,090 --> 00:36:34,923
I still feel like,

1420
00:36:35,170 --> 00:36:37,180
you know the injury
rate and all that stuff,

1421
00:36:37,210 --> 00:36:37,990
you know.

1422
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:38,890
Oh that's true too.

1423
00:36:38,891 --> 00:36:43,030
What was that one young guy who was
like a real promising football player.

1424
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:43,701
Just blue.

1425
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:44,890
It's just at any moment man.

1426
00:36:44,891 --> 00:36:47,800
And then one with the hand of God
can come and just no more for you.

1427
00:36:47,870 --> 00:36:50,260
The circles your whole life
actually the hand a probability,

1428
00:36:50,261 --> 00:36:50,501
right?

1429
00:36:50,501 --> 00:36:50,730
Yeah.

1430
00:36:50,730 --> 00:36:55,270
Cause it's such a dangerous
occupationally running into people,

1431
00:36:55,271 --> 00:36:57,810
full black running super
athletes at each other,

1432
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,440
like a gladiator moving.

1433
00:36:59,470 --> 00:36:59,810
Right.

1434
00:36:59,810 --> 00:37:00,520
It's like,

1435
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:03,550
it's also what you're paying for is
that sort of what people want to see.

1436
00:37:03,551 --> 00:37:04,220
And,

1437
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:04,690
um,

1438
00:37:04,690 --> 00:37:05,170
this,

1439
00:37:05,170 --> 00:37:07,000
one of the other things about your book,

1440
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:12,030
about the Color Code that freaked me out
was the stories of cops with their gun

1441
00:37:12,731 --> 00:37:16,720
on safety with their tendons
exploded in their fingers,

1442
00:37:16,930 --> 00:37:19,900
shot dead because they're
gun was on safety and they
kept squeezing the trigger,

1443
00:37:19,901 --> 00:37:20,830
but nothing was happening.

1444
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:21,741
Video of a,

1445
00:37:21,741 --> 00:37:24,040
of a cop who is just
saying drop the weapon,

1446
00:37:24,041 --> 00:37:24,671
drop the weapon.

1447
00:37:24,671 --> 00:37:26,950
And he's what they call a
stuck on the behavioral loop.

1448
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:28,870
So that's condition black.

1449
00:37:28,871 --> 00:37:31,330
So when you get so stressed
out that your heart rate is,

1450
00:37:31,331 --> 00:37:31,600
you know,

1451
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:31,901
very,

1452
00:37:31,901 --> 00:37:32,734
very high,

1453
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:34,870
175 beats per minute or whatever it is,

1454
00:37:34,871 --> 00:37:35,160
it's,

1455
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:35,530
it's,

1456
00:37:35,530 --> 00:37:37,750
you have what they called dissociation.

1457
00:37:37,751 --> 00:37:41,710
So you start having perceptual
issues like time moves slowly.

1458
00:37:41,890 --> 00:37:42,970
You don't hear things,

1459
00:37:42,971 --> 00:37:43,900
you don't see things.

1460
00:37:43,901 --> 00:37:45,190
A tunnel vision,

1461
00:37:45,191 --> 00:37:46,000
like the gun,

1462
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,470
all you can see is the barrel of the gun,

1463
00:37:47,471 --> 00:37:48,304
right or whatever.

1464
00:37:48,730 --> 00:37:50,080
And you get behavioral looping.

1465
00:37:50,081 --> 00:37:52,030
Like people do the same
thing over and over again.

1466
00:37:52,031 --> 00:37:52,864
So like,

1467
00:37:52,930 --> 00:37:53,111
you know,

1468
00:37:53,111 --> 00:37:53,761
they're stuck in the,

1469
00:37:53,761 --> 00:37:55,480
in the nightclub and they're
trying to open the door.

1470
00:37:55,481 --> 00:37:55,970
Right.

1471
00:37:55,970 --> 00:37:56,621
Door is locked,

1472
00:37:56,621 --> 00:37:59,440
but they stayed there for 10
minutes because that's it.

1473
00:37:59,470 --> 00:38:00,460
That's their only thing.

1474
00:38:00,610 --> 00:38:02,380
Or the cops are pulling their,

1475
00:38:02,381 --> 00:38:02,591
you know,

1476
00:38:02,591 --> 00:38:03,401
pull and trying to find,

1477
00:38:03,401 --> 00:38:04,091
work their weapon.

1478
00:38:04,091 --> 00:38:06,910
Or is there's a video of this cop yelling,

1479
00:38:06,911 --> 00:38:07,541
drop the weapon,

1480
00:38:07,541 --> 00:38:08,141
drop the weapon,

1481
00:38:08,141 --> 00:38:08,681
drop the weapon,

1482
00:38:08,681 --> 00:38:09,600
and then the guys reloading,

1483
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,280
oh and drop the weapon.

1484
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:14,440
And then he shoots the cop and
he couldn't get out of that loop.

1485
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:15,611
And again,

1486
00:38:15,611 --> 00:38:19,720
what's interesting about it
is it makes sense if you're,

1487
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:20,620
if we're cavemen,

1488
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,390
like if there's a wolf,

1489
00:38:22,450 --> 00:38:22,721
you know,

1490
00:38:22,721 --> 00:38:25,250
chewing on my arm and I'm losing my mind,

1491
00:38:25,251 --> 00:38:25,421
I'm like,

1492
00:38:25,421 --> 00:38:27,010
just keep hitting them
with a rock like this.

1493
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,120
You've got to just keep doing that.

1494
00:38:28,121 --> 00:38:28,630
Like that's,

1495
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:29,463
that's your survival.

1496
00:38:29,530 --> 00:38:29,771
That's,

1497
00:38:29,771 --> 00:38:30,161
that's it.

1498
00:38:30,161 --> 00:38:30,994
That's my best plant,

1499
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:31,510
you know?

1500
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:32,343
Right.

1501
00:38:32,650 --> 00:38:36,900
But in the modern world where you
have a need for critical thinking,

1502
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:37,711
you know,

1503
00:38:37,711 --> 00:38:38,700
you need like,

1504
00:38:38,730 --> 00:38:38,950
you know,

1505
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:39,970
even this guy's in the,

1506
00:38:40,050 --> 00:38:42,390
in the nightclub fire
and in Brazil recently,

1507
00:38:42,391 --> 00:38:42,630
uh,

1508
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:43,431
some of those guys were,

1509
00:38:43,431 --> 00:38:45,140
were Facebook and me
and talking about what,

1510
00:38:45,170 --> 00:38:47,220
what worked and what didn't
work and how they got out.

1511
00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:47,701
And you know,

1512
00:38:47,701 --> 00:38:49,260
the guys and a lot of them didn't,

1513
00:38:49,261 --> 00:38:49,491
you know,

1514
00:38:49,491 --> 00:38:49,800
it was,

1515
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:50,160
it was,

1516
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,030
there wasn't a way out,

1517
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:52,020
but hundreds of people,

1518
00:38:52,021 --> 00:38:52,470
right?

1519
00:38:52,470 --> 00:38:52,801
Yeah.

1520
00:38:52,801 --> 00:38:53,431
And it's terrible.

1521
00:38:53,431 --> 00:38:53,910
But you know,

1522
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:54,661
I'm not like an next,

1523
00:38:54,661 --> 00:38:56,880
I didn't really study it in depth,

1524
00:38:56,881 --> 00:38:57,714
but again,

1525
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:58,771
the critical thinking.

1526
00:38:58,771 --> 00:39:00,060
So finding ways out,

1527
00:39:00,061 --> 00:39:00,661
finding,

1528
00:39:00,661 --> 00:39:00,901
you know,

1529
00:39:00,901 --> 00:39:01,734
thinking,

1530
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:03,960
being able to step back and go,

1531
00:39:03,961 --> 00:39:04,141
oh,

1532
00:39:04,141 --> 00:39:05,490
there's another exit in the kitchen.

1533
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:06,840
There's always an exit in the kitchen,

1534
00:39:06,870 --> 00:39:07,210
you know,

1535
00:39:07,210 --> 00:39:07,410
and,

1536
00:39:07,410 --> 00:39:08,340
and uh,

1537
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:10,440
and get getting to it is,

1538
00:39:10,441 --> 00:39:11,161
is the trick.

1539
00:39:11,161 --> 00:39:11,761
And you know,

1540
00:39:11,761 --> 00:39:13,050
when you're in condition black,

1541
00:39:13,051 --> 00:39:14,220
you can't get there.

1542
00:39:14,221 --> 00:39:14,461
You know,

1543
00:39:14,461 --> 00:39:15,570
you can't,

1544
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:18,150
that's the whole problem is like,

1545
00:39:18,151 --> 00:39:19,110
you can't think of it.

1546
00:39:19,111 --> 00:39:19,321
You know,

1547
00:39:19,321 --> 00:39:21,090
you can't see yourself clearly enough.

1548
00:39:21,270 --> 00:39:22,300
And this is the thing that,

1549
00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:22,471
you know,

1550
00:39:22,471 --> 00:39:24,060
that people do call it combat breathing,

1551
00:39:24,061 --> 00:39:24,550
where they take,

1552
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:24,750
you know,

1553
00:39:24,750 --> 00:39:26,460
four deep breaths on a four count,

1554
00:39:27,570 --> 00:39:29,160
which is great if you can think to do it,

1555
00:39:29,161 --> 00:39:29,611
you know what I mean?

1556
00:39:29,611 --> 00:39:30,031
But again,

1557
00:39:30,031 --> 00:39:32,660
the problem is you don't know you're
in condition black when you're in

1558
00:39:32,661 --> 00:39:33,494
conditioned black,

1559
00:39:33,770 --> 00:39:34,140
right.

1560
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:35,040
And it's this,

1561
00:39:35,041 --> 00:39:35,970
it's Nick's up on you

1562
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:41,100
in the inevitability of our demise is in
the back of our head and when all of a

1563
00:39:41,511 --> 00:39:42,910
sudden you're confronted by it,

1564
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:44,050
like gets here.

1565
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:44,381
Yeah.

1566
00:39:44,381 --> 00:39:48,940
It becomes exponentially more stressful
than it is for an animal because even

1567
00:39:48,941 --> 00:39:51,850
though an animal instinctively knows
it's got to get the fuck away from you,

1568
00:39:51,851 --> 00:39:55,320
I don't think they can really calculating,

1569
00:39:55,330 --> 00:39:56,920
quantify all the possibilities.

1570
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,061
And when we do,

1571
00:39:58,061 --> 00:40:00,340
it's like it's paralysis by analysis.

1572
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:03,400
It's the adrenaline
dump and the heart rate.

1573
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:05,120
What does the heart rate when
you're in condition black?

1574
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:05,741
It depends.

1575
00:40:05,741 --> 00:40:05,921
You know,

1576
00:40:05,921 --> 00:40:06,101
it's,

1577
00:40:06,101 --> 00:40:06,551
it's very,

1578
00:40:06,551 --> 00:40:08,080
it's all specific to the person,

1579
00:40:08,081 --> 00:40:08,441
but you know,

1580
00:40:08,441 --> 00:40:11,110
175 so it's like one whole sprinting.

1581
00:40:11,130 --> 00:40:11,500
Yeah.

1582
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:13,060
And it's not from exercise at all.

1583
00:40:13,061 --> 00:40:14,350
So it's just from adrenaline.

1584
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:15,210
There's actually a,

1585
00:40:15,210 --> 00:40:16,330
which makes it really hard to breathe.

1586
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,600
There's this thing called the V,

1587
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:19,270
so Vega vagal response,

1588
00:40:19,271 --> 00:40:19,541
and you know,

1589
00:40:19,541 --> 00:40:20,530
the Vegas is a nerve,

1590
00:40:20,531 --> 00:40:21,970
but the way it was put to me,

1591
00:40:21,971 --> 00:40:24,490
which I thought was great was it's a,

1592
00:40:24,491 --> 00:40:25,030
it's a,

1593
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:25,811
it's in the book,

1594
00:40:25,811 --> 00:40:25,991
Dude.

1595
00:40:25,991 --> 00:40:26,271
I,

1596
00:40:26,271 --> 00:40:27,104
I,

1597
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:27,791
it's like,

1598
00:40:27,791 --> 00:40:29,980
it's myelinated nerve
colonnade and response.

1599
00:40:29,981 --> 00:40:34,060
So it's a polyvagal theory illegal
basically like this a Reptilian reptilian

1600
00:40:34,061 --> 00:40:34,841
part of your brain.

1601
00:40:34,841 --> 00:40:35,111
Right?

1602
00:40:35,111 --> 00:40:35,321
You know,

1603
00:40:35,321 --> 00:40:39,580
we all know that and there's
two kinds of Vegas that,

1604
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:41,710
that operate possibly and,

1605
00:40:41,770 --> 00:40:42,930
and uh,

1606
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:44,110
one is Reptilian,

1607
00:40:44,111 --> 00:40:45,300
one has mammalians rights,

1608
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:47,140
but if the reptilian one gets into it,

1609
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:52,510
that can slow you down and make you
freeze and the Mammalian one wants you to

1610
00:40:52,511 --> 00:40:52,781
run,

1611
00:40:52,781 --> 00:40:52,991
run,

1612
00:40:52,991 --> 00:40:53,261
run,

1613
00:40:53,261 --> 00:40:53,471
run,

1614
00:40:53,471 --> 00:40:53,741
run.

1615
00:40:53,741 --> 00:40:53,981
Right?

1616
00:40:53,981 --> 00:40:57,790
So it's like stepping on the gas pedal
and the brake at the same time as hard as

1617
00:40:57,791 --> 00:40:58,624
you can.

1618
00:40:58,930 --> 00:41:00,220
And that's what condition black is.

1619
00:41:00,221 --> 00:41:01,270
You think about doing that in your car,

1620
00:41:01,271 --> 00:41:06,271
getting your car and just jumping on the
gas and the brake as hard as you can.

1621
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:10,740
That happens that people panic
in automobile accidents as well.

1622
00:41:10,770 --> 00:41:11,160
Yeah.

1623
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:13,500
People think they're hitting the
brake and the hitting the gas,

1624
00:41:13,770 --> 00:41:15,230
I've hit the brake by
accident when you're hitting,

1625
00:41:15,231 --> 00:41:16,064
you know what I mean?

1626
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:16,341
Like,

1627
00:41:16,341 --> 00:41:16,971
Oh shit.

1628
00:41:16,971 --> 00:41:17,804
You know what I mean?

1629
00:41:19,190 --> 00:41:19,320
Yeah.

1630
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:20,310
They were right next door.

1631
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,600
I really fucking close the,

1632
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:23,210
the,

1633
00:41:23,210 --> 00:41:26,760
the modern life we live is so soft.

1634
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:27,900
It's so easy,

1635
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:32,610
the ability to go to Jack in the box and
feed your fat face while you're still

1636
00:41:32,611 --> 00:41:33,444
in your,

1637
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:34,160
which

1638
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:34,431
you,

1639
00:41:34,431 --> 00:41:34,671
you know,

1640
00:41:34,671 --> 00:41:35,810
you didn't build that car,

1641
00:41:35,811 --> 00:41:36,860
you didn't design it.

1642
00:41:36,861 --> 00:41:38,210
And how it works.

1643
00:41:38,450 --> 00:41:43,450
Easy job at an easy place where you're
not stressing at all during the day.

1644
00:41:44,450 --> 00:41:46,100
You're just doing whatever
the fuck you gotta do,

1645
00:41:46,110 --> 00:41:46,851
Sell Insurance,

1646
00:41:46,851 --> 00:41:47,301
whatever it is.

1647
00:41:47,301 --> 00:41:47,511
I mean,

1648
00:41:47,511 --> 00:41:49,970
whatever normal stress you have
from sending in a normal office,

1649
00:41:49,971 --> 00:41:53,990
but your body literally is never taxed.

1650
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:56,900
If you're the average person
that doesn't exercise,

1651
00:41:57,350 --> 00:42:02,150
you've reached a level of the human
animal has reached a level that doesn't

1652
00:42:02,151 --> 00:42:02,990
exist in nature

1653
00:42:05,410 --> 00:42:08,240
and animal that can't survive on its own,

1654
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:12,480
attached symbiotically
cultural since two hour two.

1655
00:42:12,490 --> 00:42:13,400
Well you can't make it.

1656
00:42:15,690 --> 00:42:19,160
Even a dog can fucking go
out there and kill rat a rat.

1657
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:20,240
You know,

1658
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:21,170
what are you going to do?

1659
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:22,041
Yeah,

1660
00:42:22,041 --> 00:42:22,880
well most of them.

1661
00:42:22,881 --> 00:42:23,820
And I think the,

1662
00:42:23,830 --> 00:42:25,210
what I realized because I did that,

1663
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:27,920
so I was getting ready for the end
of the world in various scenarios.

1664
00:42:27,921 --> 00:42:29,930
And I did work outs and uh,

1665
00:42:29,931 --> 00:42:30,141
you know,

1666
00:42:30,141 --> 00:42:30,221
I,

1667
00:42:30,221 --> 00:42:30,620
I,

1668
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:30,930
you know,

1669
00:42:30,930 --> 00:42:31,940
did a bunch of different stuff.

1670
00:42:31,941 --> 00:42:34,260
But one of the important
things about fitness is,

1671
00:42:34,430 --> 00:42:39,290
is it keeps your mind ready for the
disaster you can handle and adrenaline

1672
00:42:39,291 --> 00:42:41,150
better if you're in good shape.

1673
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:41,451
You know,

1674
00:42:41,451 --> 00:42:42,680
and if you've gotten your sleep,

1675
00:42:42,681 --> 00:42:43,000
you know,

1676
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:43,700
it,

1677
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:47,090
a lot of those breakdowns happen
when people are sleep deprived.

1678
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:48,140
So,

1679
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:48,973
you know,

1680
00:42:49,790 --> 00:42:54,170
you read about people that have had
panic attacks and a lot of it comes after

1681
00:42:54,171 --> 00:42:55,850
they have insomnia for a long time,

1682
00:42:55,851 --> 00:42:56,220
you know,

1683
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:56,760
sleep,

1684
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:57,170
you know,

1685
00:42:57,170 --> 00:42:58,700
not getting your sleep is huge.

1686
00:42:58,700 --> 00:42:59,360
All that shit.

1687
00:42:59,360 --> 00:42:59,601
Yeah.

1688
00:42:59,601 --> 00:43:00,800
What a strange animal.

1689
00:43:00,850 --> 00:43:01,190
You know,

1690
00:43:01,190 --> 00:43:03,260
the fact that we need
to shut off every night.

1691
00:43:03,290 --> 00:43:04,160
Well they were kind of,

1692
00:43:04,170 --> 00:43:04,881
most of them do.

1693
00:43:04,881 --> 00:43:05,410
Right.

1694
00:43:05,410 --> 00:43:10,410
But what a weird property of our existence
that we have to shut off the world is

1695
00:43:10,761 --> 00:43:11,331
so stressful.

1696
00:43:11,331 --> 00:43:14,440
You have to spend a third of it
not paying attention and that,

1697
00:43:14,450 --> 00:43:16,940
and we don't even exactly
know why you need to do it.

1698
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:17,361
I mean we're,

1699
00:43:17,361 --> 00:43:22,130
we're so confused on what exactly is
going on during rem sleep and we know you

1700
00:43:22,131 --> 00:43:22,881
the aspects,

1701
00:43:22,881 --> 00:43:25,560
we know hormones Murray.

1702
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:29,690
And the real issue is the psychedelic
drugs that your brain releases while

1703
00:43:29,691 --> 00:43:30,260
you're sleeping.

1704
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:32,630
That's when things get really
fucked up and you're like,

1705
00:43:32,631 --> 00:43:34,190
what is going on when you're dreaming?

1706
00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:37,400
And what happens to people who don't
get the dream ended up having psychotic

1707
00:43:37,410 --> 00:43:37,790
breakdown?

1708
00:43:37,790 --> 00:43:38,451
They get crazy.

1709
00:43:38,451 --> 00:43:38,720
Yeah.

1710
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:38,960
Yeah.

1711
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:43,010
When they've done studies where they've
kept people awake for days at a time,

1712
00:43:43,011 --> 00:43:45,320
like people literally lose their shifts.

1713
00:43:45,321 --> 00:43:46,010
They kind of breakdown.

1714
00:43:46,010 --> 00:43:46,360
Yeah.

1715
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:47,420
That'd become psychos.

1716
00:43:47,810 --> 00:43:48,531
48 hours,

1717
00:43:48,531 --> 00:43:51,740
72 matches being tired like
your mind just delusion.

1718
00:43:51,810 --> 00:43:52,643
Yeah.

1719
00:43:52,710 --> 00:43:53,241
Fuck out.

1720
00:43:53,241 --> 00:43:54,530
It just doesn't function right.

1721
00:43:54,950 --> 00:43:55,521
It's very,

1722
00:43:55,521 --> 00:43:56,340
very odd.

1723
00:43:56,340 --> 00:43:57,173
Yeah.

1724
00:43:57,470 --> 00:44:00,530
It's interesting cause a lot of this
stuff like they are doing a lot more

1725
00:44:00,531 --> 00:44:01,850
science of fear now,

1726
00:44:01,851 --> 00:44:02,091
right.

1727
00:44:02,091 --> 00:44:02,451
So they're like,

1728
00:44:02,451 --> 00:44:06,200
they're putting electrode caps on people
and chucking them out of airplanes and

1729
00:44:06,201 --> 00:44:08,390
sort of so they can really
sort of see what's happening.

1730
00:44:08,391 --> 00:44:11,000
So there's some interesting new books,

1731
00:44:11,001 --> 00:44:12,010
like extreme fear.

1732
00:44:12,030 --> 00:44:13,730
Jeff Wise's book is pretty cool.

1733
00:44:13,731 --> 00:44:14,431
Like it's about what,

1734
00:44:14,431 --> 00:44:16,400
even a jumping out of an airplane.

1735
00:44:16,401 --> 00:44:17,870
It's sort of a controlled situation.

1736
00:44:17,871 --> 00:44:18,141
Like yeah,

1737
00:44:18,141 --> 00:44:19,040
you're shitting your pants,

1738
00:44:19,041 --> 00:44:20,010
cause your pair of shooting,

1739
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:22,220
but you're not fighting Anderson Silva.

1740
00:44:22,221 --> 00:44:22,611
You're not,

1741
00:44:22,611 --> 00:44:22,851
you know,

1742
00:44:22,851 --> 00:44:24,740
you're not in a car accident and it's not,

1743
00:44:24,741 --> 00:44:25,010
you know,

1744
00:44:25,010 --> 00:44:26,120
it's not like the building's on fire.

1745
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:26,973
It's your,

1746
00:44:27,290 --> 00:44:30,670
what I love about what I was
like about MMA and stuff does he,

1747
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:32,100
you get to train for it and

1748
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:32,260
you know,

1749
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:34,630
nobody's going to hit you behind
the head with a two by four.

1750
00:44:34,631 --> 00:44:35,111
You know what I mean?

1751
00:44:35,111 --> 00:44:36,370
It's like you get ready.

1752
00:44:36,430 --> 00:44:37,120
Yeah.

1753
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:37,481
And we're,

1754
00:44:37,481 --> 00:44:39,220
I always worried about myself was like,

1755
00:44:39,221 --> 00:44:40,450
what if I'm not ready?

1756
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:41,200
Yeah.

1757
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:44,410
And I'm just driving home and the
shit hits the fan and I'm like,

1758
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:44,680
uh,

1759
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:45,040
you know,

1760
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:49,060
how long would it take me to adjust
my reality to this new reality?

1761
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:49,920
Yeah.

1762
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:53,030
Being prepared is such a relief.

1763
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:54,600
It's a relief thing too.

1764
00:44:54,690 --> 00:44:55,740
It relieves stress.

1765
00:44:55,741 --> 00:44:56,574
Yeah,

1766
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:57,940
well that's where I want it to go.

1767
00:44:57,941 --> 00:44:59,470
You know what I realized was like,

1768
00:44:59,471 --> 00:45:04,471
I don't want to be paranoid and be a
doomsday prepper because I think sometimes

1769
00:45:04,751 --> 00:45:07,690
that then ends up being
a counter productive.

1770
00:45:07,691 --> 00:45:07,991
Like you,

1771
00:45:07,991 --> 00:45:11,740
you know the anxiety is
making you less relaxed.

1772
00:45:11,890 --> 00:45:12,260
Right?

1773
00:45:12,260 --> 00:45:13,180
You're more worried,

1774
00:45:13,181 --> 00:45:16,390
you're more fearful of your neighbors
and you're more convinced of like,

1775
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:18,130
I got to shoot everybody.

1776
00:45:18,950 --> 00:45:19,391
Know what I mean?

1777
00:45:19,391 --> 00:45:19,610
People.

1778
00:45:19,610 --> 00:45:19,870
Yeah.

1779
00:45:19,870 --> 00:45:20,500
That way they're going to,

1780
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:21,221
they're ready to go.

1781
00:45:21,221 --> 00:45:21,551
You know,

1782
00:45:21,551 --> 00:45:22,870
they got their guns and
they were ready to go.

1783
00:45:22,871 --> 00:45:23,980
There's a lot of those folks,

1784
00:45:24,340 --> 00:45:26,710
they're just ready to rock and roll.

1785
00:45:26,711 --> 00:45:28,570
When Kev large grocery store,

1786
00:45:29,170 --> 00:45:29,710
well you know,

1787
00:45:29,710 --> 00:45:33,520
one strapped to the rank one
their belt one to their body,

1788
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:34,953
you know,

1789
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:35,861
anyone fighting,

1790
00:45:35,861 --> 00:45:36,880
they always say be first,

1791
00:45:36,881 --> 00:45:37,121
right?

1792
00:45:37,121 --> 00:45:38,290
Like maxing be first.

1793
00:45:38,291 --> 00:45:41,590
And that's why I ended the book with
don't be first like don't be the fucking

1794
00:45:41,591 --> 00:45:43,300
guy who starts shooting right away.

1795
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:43,961
You know what I mean?

1796
00:45:43,961 --> 00:45:46,150
Because you don't want to,

1797
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:47,110
don't want to be that guy.

1798
00:45:47,111 --> 00:45:47,321
Like,

1799
00:45:47,321 --> 00:45:49,480
that's not the smart move and a,

1800
00:45:49,510 --> 00:45:53,230
that's not the best one for survival
because people need each other like

1801
00:45:53,231 --> 00:45:55,330
primates in the wilderness band together.

1802
00:45:55,331 --> 00:45:55,750
Right?

1803
00:45:55,750 --> 00:45:57,040
Like the best thing,

1804
00:45:57,130 --> 00:45:59,830
the best survival team you can have,

1805
00:45:59,831 --> 00:46:01,540
the best is it is a team of experts,

1806
00:46:01,541 --> 00:46:01,720
right?

1807
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:05,170
It is the best thing to have
in your go bag is a doctor,

1808
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:06,340
a mechanic,

1809
00:46:06,550 --> 00:46:07,181
and a soldier.

1810
00:46:07,181 --> 00:46:07,391
Right.

1811
00:46:07,391 --> 00:46:07,541
You know,

1812
00:46:07,541 --> 00:46:09,670
it's like you're not going to
do all those things yourself.

1813
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:10,420
Right.

1814
00:46:10,420 --> 00:46:10,811
So anyway,

1815
00:46:10,811 --> 00:46:11,950
that was kind of where I took it,

1816
00:46:11,951 --> 00:46:12,630
you know,

1817
00:46:12,630 --> 00:46:14,220
that is though it was so important.

1818
00:46:14,221 --> 00:46:14,871
And that was a,

1819
00:46:14,871 --> 00:46:16,020
also part of,

1820
00:46:16,021 --> 00:46:16,950
into the wilds,

1821
00:46:17,150 --> 00:46:17,491
he said,

1822
00:46:17,491 --> 00:46:22,491
he was saying that all this beautiful
wilderness that he came to love really,

1823
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:24,480
he couldn't enjoy it without people.

1824
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:24,770
Right.

1825
00:46:24,770 --> 00:46:25,120
You know,

1826
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:25,560
it's one of the,

1827
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:26,281
I forgot that part.

1828
00:46:26,281 --> 00:46:26,621
Yeah.

1829
00:46:26,621 --> 00:46:28,840
And that was very
profound to me because I,

1830
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:30,481
I,

1831
00:46:30,481 --> 00:46:31,230
um,

1832
00:46:31,230 --> 00:46:31,870
make a lot,

1833
00:46:31,870 --> 00:46:32,461
I have like a little,

1834
00:46:32,461 --> 00:46:35,280
a bit of a dance between too many
people and not enough people.

1835
00:46:35,370 --> 00:46:35,791
You know,

1836
00:46:35,791 --> 00:46:36,624
I go,

1837
00:46:36,690 --> 00:46:40,500
one of the things I loved about living
in Colorado was that it was like super

1838
00:46:40,501 --> 00:46:45,480
quiet rural and I could be around like
virtually no one and just chill and

1839
00:46:45,481 --> 00:46:45,960
relax.

1840
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:47,730
But I don't know if I'd
like that all the time.

1841
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:49,650
I think I liked that because
I'm always dealing with

1842
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:50,660
yes crowds.

1843
00:46:50,930 --> 00:46:51,081
No,

1844
00:46:51,081 --> 00:46:52,730
I love to spend half the day of myself,

1845
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:53,710
but I think yeah,

1846
00:46:53,730 --> 00:46:54,270
if I,

1847
00:46:54,270 --> 00:46:56,060
I've never gone a long time.

1848
00:46:56,090 --> 00:46:59,900
Like I've never gone more than four or
five days without seeing people and I

1849
00:46:59,901 --> 00:47:01,310
think I would lose my shit.

1850
00:47:01,370 --> 00:47:03,170
I think I'd get pretty bummed.

1851
00:47:03,350 --> 00:47:04,670
I think you can easily,

1852
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:07,340
are you familiar with the vice.com?

1853
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:07,530
Yeah,

1854
00:47:07,530 --> 00:47:07,741
yeah,

1855
00:47:07,741 --> 00:47:08,574
yeah.

1856
00:47:09,070 --> 00:47:10,550
No vice guide to travel.

1857
00:47:10,551 --> 00:47:11,210
You're a senior.

1858
00:47:11,210 --> 00:47:12,140
They have to do's and don'ts.

1859
00:47:12,590 --> 00:47:14,360
The fashion do's and don'ts device does,

1860
00:47:14,430 --> 00:47:17,720
but they have a lot of
different cool things airline.

1861
00:47:17,750 --> 00:47:19,800
But one of them they had was a hind Moe's,

1862
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:20,100
uh,

1863
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:20,630
Arctic,

1864
00:47:20,630 --> 00:47:22,550
I think it's called
Heimos Arctic adventure.

1865
00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:28,090
And it's a guy named Hein Mo and he
lives up in the northeast of Alaska.

1866
00:47:30,270 --> 00:47:34,830
He's like one of the last people that's
allowed to like keep a cabin up there.

1867
00:47:34,970 --> 00:47:38,910
And it was sort of like a homesteader
group situation grandfathered in and yeah,

1868
00:47:38,911 --> 00:47:40,500
and this guy's been up there for,

1869
00:47:40,590 --> 00:47:42,420
since like the 1970s.

1870
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:43,730
It's a really fascinating,

1871
00:47:43,731 --> 00:47:47,520
and they had these dudes from vice
magazine went up there and lived with this

1872
00:47:47,521 --> 00:47:51,240
guy for a week and got to see him shoot
a bear that was intruding in their,

1873
00:47:51,241 --> 00:47:53,790
cause he's hanging these Caribou
out in front of his camp,

1874
00:47:53,791 --> 00:47:55,230
but occasionally a bear
will coming to campus,

1875
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:57,450
a bear ate his dog alive.

1876
00:47:57,451 --> 00:47:59,130
I was attached to a chain,

1877
00:47:59,131 --> 00:48:00,570
like really dark dark shit.

1878
00:48:00,810 --> 00:48:01,950
And so he's out there.

1879
00:48:01,951 --> 00:48:02,370
Yeah.

1880
00:48:02,370 --> 00:48:03,360
While he's there,

1881
00:48:03,361 --> 00:48:04,081
while they're there,

1882
00:48:04,081 --> 00:48:05,920
the guy goes out and
has to shoot this bear.

1883
00:48:06,660 --> 00:48:09,000
And like in the middle of the
night it's really fucked up.

1884
00:48:09,001 --> 00:48:09,811
Like you hear him running,

1885
00:48:09,811 --> 00:48:11,040
you hear guns going off,

1886
00:48:11,041 --> 00:48:12,210
you hear the bear moaning.

1887
00:48:12,210 --> 00:48:13,590
It's like really kind of fucked up.

1888
00:48:13,591 --> 00:48:16,410
Cause his grizzly had
founded staff once a Grizzly,

1889
00:48:16,430 --> 00:48:17,263
fine,

1890
00:48:17,690 --> 00:48:18,570
they're going to come for you.

1891
00:48:18,930 --> 00:48:19,230
Um,

1892
00:48:19,230 --> 00:48:21,270
but he was up there at one point in time.

1893
00:48:21,271 --> 00:48:21,541
He said,

1894
00:48:21,541 --> 00:48:24,150
I think for eight months
by himself and he was like,

1895
00:48:24,151 --> 00:48:25,200
I will never do that again.

1896
00:48:25,350 --> 00:48:26,160
It's like that's,

1897
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:26,911
that was too much.

1898
00:48:26,911 --> 00:48:27,810
That was too crazy.

1899
00:48:28,060 --> 00:48:29,700
You have those solo sailors get into that.

1900
00:48:29,701 --> 00:48:33,250
They spend six months at sea by
themselves and must fuck you.

1901
00:48:33,260 --> 00:48:34,051
Get on it down.

1902
00:48:34,051 --> 00:48:34,211
Yeah,

1903
00:48:34,211 --> 00:48:34,381
yeah,

1904
00:48:34,381 --> 00:48:34,920
yeah.

1905
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:37,920
You must be just so happy
to communicate with anybody.

1906
00:48:38,070 --> 00:48:38,903
Yeah.

1907
00:48:39,270 --> 00:48:39,481
Yeah.

1908
00:48:39,481 --> 00:48:39,841
I wouldn't,

1909
00:48:39,841 --> 00:48:40,830
I wouldn't want to try it.

1910
00:48:41,190 --> 00:48:41,760
Um,

1911
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:42,091
and you know,

1912
00:48:42,091 --> 00:48:43,770
now that I have a wife and kid too,

1913
00:48:43,771 --> 00:48:44,191
it's like,

1914
00:48:44,191 --> 00:48:44,480
you know,

1915
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:44,720
I can't,

1916
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:45,920
I'm like so codependent.

1917
00:48:45,921 --> 00:48:46,740
It's retarded.

1918
00:48:46,740 --> 00:48:49,380
Well that's one of the interesting things
about your book is that you and I are

1919
00:48:49,470 --> 00:48:51,700
sort of very similar in
that way that you're,

1920
00:48:52,410 --> 00:48:55,680
I don't want to say I felt invulnerable
cause I was always aware of my

1921
00:48:55,710 --> 00:48:56,543
mortality,

1922
00:48:56,550 --> 00:49:00,720
but I didn't worry about it
nearly as much as I started to,

1923
00:49:00,721 --> 00:49:05,721
once you started having children and in
your case you waited until your kid was

1924
00:49:06,421 --> 00:49:07,450
like fate,

1925
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:08,640
basically acceptable age.

1926
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:09,480
Like okay,

1927
00:49:09,510 --> 00:49:11,040
I'm going to the Amazon
for a little while.

1928
00:49:11,041 --> 00:49:11,341
I'm like,

1929
00:49:11,341 --> 00:49:12,360
wow.

1930
00:49:12,361 --> 00:49:12,840
Like,

1931
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:17,840
that must've been quite a mind fuck to
be in that state of mind where you know,

1932
00:49:18,241 --> 00:49:20,130
you now have this baby,

1933
00:49:20,131 --> 00:49:23,370
that incredible love for your wife.

1934
00:49:23,371 --> 00:49:24,180
It's incredible lover,

1935
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:27,810
her and this manly need to take care
of everything and then all of a sudden

1936
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:30,150
you're in the fucking
jungle starving to death.

1937
00:49:31,230 --> 00:49:32,760
How long were you at it was a good idea.

1938
00:49:32,950 --> 00:49:33,800
I want to like six,

1939
00:49:33,930 --> 00:49:35,880
you know who I went to
see was Tony the Souza.

1940
00:49:35,970 --> 00:49:36,540
Ah,

1941
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:36,871
but he would,

1942
00:49:36,871 --> 00:49:37,050
didn't,

1943
00:49:37,050 --> 00:49:37,501
wasn't there.

1944
00:49:37,501 --> 00:49:38,071
He actually bit,

1945
00:49:38,071 --> 00:49:38,701
of course he bet.

1946
00:49:38,701 --> 00:49:39,870
Like he ended up being somewhere else.

1947
00:49:39,871 --> 00:49:43,530
And Tony to Susan's an MMA
fighter or Jujitsu guys.

1948
00:49:43,531 --> 00:49:44,010
Uh,

1949
00:49:44,010 --> 00:49:45,410
a real free spirit who is,

1950
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:46,253
yeah,

1951
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:47,070
yeah,

1952
00:49:47,070 --> 00:49:47,220
yeah.

1953
00:49:47,220 --> 00:49:47,850
I'll leave it at that.

1954
00:49:47,850 --> 00:49:48,810
We were going to Brazil,

1955
00:49:48,811 --> 00:49:49,680
we were in Brazil wants a,

1956
00:49:49,681 --> 00:49:53,610
me and Eddie were talking about Iowasca
and a ton of the suitors just listen to

1957
00:49:53,611 --> 00:49:54,300
us and he goes,

1958
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:55,470
I'll fucking take that shit.

1959
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:56,420
Do it.

1960
00:49:56,420 --> 00:49:57,420
Just do it right now.

1961
00:49:57,540 --> 00:49:58,850
It's like his attitude was like,

1962
00:49:59,080 --> 00:49:59,640
it was like,

1963
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:00,151
let's do it.

1964
00:50:00,151 --> 00:50:01,680
So gangster now he went down,

1965
00:50:01,681 --> 00:50:04,030
the Amazon would like $40 or less.

1966
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:04,871
You know,

1967
00:50:04,871 --> 00:50:06,750
just bummed is what you can do that.

1968
00:50:06,751 --> 00:50:10,050
And it's like sleeping outside on the
deck of the ships for months to get to

1969
00:50:10,051 --> 00:50:10,530
Rio.

1970
00:50:10,530 --> 00:50:11,880
So he came down from Peru.

1971
00:50:11,980 --> 00:50:12,780
Wow.

1972
00:50:12,780 --> 00:50:13,171
And I was like,

1973
00:50:13,171 --> 00:50:13,921
that sounds like that.

1974
00:50:13,921 --> 00:50:14,754
That would be a great trip.

1975
00:50:15,490 --> 00:50:17,160
But it's dangerous and crazy.

1976
00:50:17,161 --> 00:50:17,921
Just crazy.

1977
00:50:17,921 --> 00:50:18,691
You might not make it.

1978
00:50:18,691 --> 00:50:18,841
Yeah.

1979
00:50:18,841 --> 00:50:19,380
And he's,

1980
00:50:19,380 --> 00:50:19,590
I mean,

1981
00:50:19,590 --> 00:50:20,670
he looks like an India,

1982
00:50:20,671 --> 00:50:21,530
so he's not,

1983
00:50:21,570 --> 00:50:22,021
and he's not like,

1984
00:50:22,021 --> 00:50:22,980
oh gringo or whatever.

1985
00:50:22,981 --> 00:50:25,810
But so you went down a long way there.

1986
00:50:25,910 --> 00:50:26,581
Just six weeks.

1987
00:50:26,581 --> 00:50:27,470
So it wasn't there for that long.

1988
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:28,040
That's a long

1989
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:29,690
fucking time in the Amazon.

1990
00:50:29,691 --> 00:50:30,650
It was,

1991
00:50:30,710 --> 00:50:31,370
it was,

1992
00:50:31,370 --> 00:50:32,570
it was a little longer than I,

1993
00:50:32,571 --> 00:50:32,841
you know,

1994
00:50:32,841 --> 00:50:34,470
it was kind of like my old way of life.

1995
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:35,120
I was like,

1996
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:35,301
Oh yeah,

1997
00:50:35,301 --> 00:50:35,871
this will be fine.

1998
00:50:35,871 --> 00:50:36,411
You know what I mean?

1999
00:50:36,411 --> 00:50:38,060
It wasn't like I really
thought it through.

2000
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:39,170
Um,

2001
00:50:39,170 --> 00:50:40,460
what it actually would mean.

2002
00:50:40,461 --> 00:50:41,294
And of course,

2003
00:50:41,540 --> 00:50:41,721
you know,

2004
00:50:41,721 --> 00:50:44,270
when you start taking care
of a kid and all that,

2005
00:50:44,271 --> 00:50:44,510
you know,

2006
00:50:44,510 --> 00:50:45,980
it becomes,

2007
00:50:46,060 --> 00:50:46,300
you know,

2008
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:47,270
you look into the abyss,

2009
00:50:47,271 --> 00:50:47,740
the abyss,

2010
00:50:47,740 --> 00:50:48,890
listen to you write it.

2011
00:50:48,891 --> 00:50:50,210
Like it definitely changes you.

2012
00:50:50,211 --> 00:50:53,420
So I couldn't stop thinking about,

2013
00:50:53,450 --> 00:50:53,960
you know,

2014
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:54,621
the kid and,

2015
00:50:54,621 --> 00:50:55,220
and you know,

2016
00:50:55,220 --> 00:50:57,500
my wife and not being
there if the big one hit.

2017
00:50:57,501 --> 00:50:59,180
And that really was the catalyst.

2018
00:50:59,330 --> 00:51:01,820
And then seeing how these
guys were so competent,

2019
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:02,391
you know,

2020
00:51:02,391 --> 00:51:03,590
it's one thing to hear like,

2021
00:51:03,770 --> 00:51:04,011
oh yeah,

2022
00:51:04,011 --> 00:51:05,570
they don't want in the forest
and make whatever they need.

2023
00:51:05,570 --> 00:51:07,850
But then to see these guys
go and make a backpack,

2024
00:51:07,851 --> 00:51:09,320
like a pretty good backpack had to like,

2025
00:51:09,610 --> 00:51:09,900
you know,

2026
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:13,010
mark and shit and just rip and it's wrong,

2027
00:51:13,011 --> 00:51:13,251
you know,

2028
00:51:13,251 --> 00:51:13,820
and,

2029
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:14,450
and,

2030
00:51:14,450 --> 00:51:16,340
and just catch fish and just do,

2031
00:51:16,341 --> 00:51:16,581
you know,

2032
00:51:16,581 --> 00:51:21,200
really be able to provide
easily for themselves.

2033
00:51:21,260 --> 00:51:22,580
I love that you,

2034
00:51:22,610 --> 00:51:23,960
they didn't give you a machete.

2035
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:24,350
Yeah.

2036
00:51:24,350 --> 00:51:27,310
You realize they had sort
of infantile that you,

2037
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:27,800
you're like,

2038
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:28,760
you can't do anything.

2039
00:51:28,970 --> 00:51:29,631
You're the Gringo.

2040
00:51:29,631 --> 00:51:29,870
Like,

2041
00:51:29,870 --> 00:51:30,020
oh,

2042
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:30,980
just walk with your backpack.

2043
00:51:30,981 --> 00:51:31,641
Don't touch shit.

2044
00:51:31,641 --> 00:51:31,851
You know?

2045
00:51:31,851 --> 00:51:33,550
And you can't get any everything.

2046
00:51:33,620 --> 00:51:33,800
Yeah.

2047
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:35,150
Everything is with the machete.

2048
00:51:35,151 --> 00:51:36,290
You don't touch anything in your hand,

2049
00:51:36,291 --> 00:51:36,741
obviously,

2050
00:51:36,741 --> 00:51:39,110
because it's the jungle and
it's poisonous since thinking.

2051
00:51:39,111 --> 00:51:39,944
And so,

2052
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:42,880
you know what a fucking crazy
place to live for six years.

2053
00:51:42,881 --> 00:51:46,820
And so literally everything around you
is dense and it can't touch it with your

2054
00:51:46,821 --> 00:51:49,950
hand because one out of how many things
is a lot of the things that boys,

2055
00:51:49,970 --> 00:51:50,241
but you know,

2056
00:51:50,241 --> 00:51:51,290
it's not like you're going to die,

2057
00:51:51,291 --> 00:51:54,140
it's just going to staying and swell
and what you're going to have bites.

2058
00:51:54,140 --> 00:51:55,150
And there's all kinds of bugs.

2059
00:51:55,151 --> 00:51:56,210
I don't even know what they are.

2060
00:51:57,140 --> 00:52:00,020
You know what's cool too is that all
the trees had a watermark on them.

2061
00:52:00,650 --> 00:52:02,450
And what you realize is
during the rainy season,

2062
00:52:02,451 --> 00:52:05,150
basically the Amazon turns into like a c,

2063
00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:07,490
there's dolphins swimming in the trees,

2064
00:52:07,940 --> 00:52:09,140
there's river dolphins swimming.

2065
00:52:09,530 --> 00:52:11,900
So the water comes up like 40 50 feet.

2066
00:52:12,380 --> 00:52:14,690
So of all of these trees is,

2067
00:52:14,750 --> 00:52:16,790
is a watermark for a couple,

2068
00:52:16,830 --> 00:52:18,740
a couple of when the rainy season,

2069
00:52:18,741 --> 00:52:22,130
because there's fish swimming
and dolphins in the trees.

2070
00:52:22,190 --> 00:52:23,270
Oh my God.

2071
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:24,890
So you're walking around.

2072
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:25,110
I was,

2073
00:52:25,110 --> 00:52:27,830
how high is the watermark
and moves around because,

2074
00:52:27,831 --> 00:52:28,091
you know,

2075
00:52:28,091 --> 00:52:29,860
but I was there in the dry season and,

2076
00:52:29,861 --> 00:52:32,610
and some places it was at the top
of trees and some places it was a,

2077
00:52:32,630 --> 00:52:32,931
you know,

2078
00:52:32,931 --> 00:52:33,560
it was,

2079
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:34,430
it was all over the place,

2080
00:52:34,431 --> 00:52:34,910
but you could,

2081
00:52:34,910 --> 00:52:36,620
it was very clear.

2082
00:52:36,770 --> 00:52:37,880
So it could have been 20,

2083
00:52:37,881 --> 00:52:40,150
30 feet above and uh,

2084
00:52:40,190 --> 00:52:43,400
and they would talk about what happens
during the rainy season and how different

2085
00:52:43,401 --> 00:52:46,640
the landscape is because all your paths
are gone and you're in a canoe doing

2086
00:52:46,641 --> 00:52:47,180
everything,

2087
00:52:47,180 --> 00:52:50,750
walking and all the life
has to move up the tree.

2088
00:52:50,751 --> 00:52:53,270
So all like the poison
is answering the trees.

2089
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:56,240
So it's actually more dangerous
because you bumped into a tree on

2090
00:52:59,340 --> 00:53:00,171
oh yeah,

2091
00:53:00,171 --> 00:53:00,470
it was,

2092
00:53:00,470 --> 00:53:01,340
it was exceeded.

2093
00:53:01,420 --> 00:53:02,450
It was a crazy scene.

2094
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:05,090
What was the goal when you went there?

2095
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:06,140
The goal?

2096
00:53:06,190 --> 00:53:07,023
Uh,

2097
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:07,811
it was just,

2098
00:53:07,811 --> 00:53:08,030
uh,

2099
00:53:08,030 --> 00:53:08,510
you know,

2100
00:53:08,510 --> 00:53:12,590
I was going to do this at the time there
was a biologist who was going to come

2101
00:53:12,591 --> 00:53:13,580
with me and,

2102
00:53:13,581 --> 00:53:14,030
uh,

2103
00:53:14,030 --> 00:53:14,271
you know,

2104
00:53:14,271 --> 00:53:16,790
some local guys and there was
like an area that was unexplored.

2105
00:53:16,791 --> 00:53:17,960
It wasn't really unexplored,

2106
00:53:17,961 --> 00:53:20,150
but a bio just meant a biologist
hadn't been through there.

2107
00:53:20,150 --> 00:53:20,690
This is,

2108
00:53:20,690 --> 00:53:21,111
you know,

2109
00:53:21,111 --> 00:53:21,944
uh,

2110
00:53:21,950 --> 00:53:24,860
it was up in the Peruvian part
of the Amazon offer to Wyo,

2111
00:53:24,970 --> 00:53:25,200
uh,

2112
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:28,770
which is a tributary and that he was
going to look around and do stuff.

2113
00:53:28,771 --> 00:53:30,990
So it was like kind of a
partially science thing,

2114
00:53:30,991 --> 00:53:31,824
but then he couldn't,

2115
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:33,750
couldn't leave his job.

2116
00:53:34,230 --> 00:53:36,150
So it was me and just four dudes,

2117
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:37,313
three dudes.

2118
00:53:37,860 --> 00:53:38,700
And it was like,

2119
00:53:38,701 --> 00:53:38,971
you know,

2120
00:53:38,971 --> 00:53:41,940
it's basically like going
with like three Hicks,

2121
00:53:42,060 --> 00:53:42,580
you know,

2122
00:53:42,580 --> 00:53:44,010
into the woods in Montana.

2123
00:53:44,011 --> 00:53:44,190
Like,

2124
00:53:44,190 --> 00:53:44,640
you know,

2125
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:45,061
they were like,

2126
00:53:45,061 --> 00:53:45,301
all right,

2127
00:53:45,301 --> 00:53:45,901
what do you want to do?

2128
00:53:45,901 --> 00:53:46,530
And I'm like,

2129
00:53:46,530 --> 00:53:48,130
what do you guys want to do this?

2130
00:53:48,220 --> 00:53:51,480
We just dicked around and we
bought the raft was kind of cool.

2131
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:53,600
So he just tried to survive out there.

2132
00:53:53,790 --> 00:53:55,980
We just hiked and survived and you know,

2133
00:53:56,420 --> 00:53:57,750
saw a lot of monkeys and stuff,

2134
00:53:57,751 --> 00:54:00,280
trail that you were
falling off the trail and,

2135
00:54:00,450 --> 00:54:01,470
and it was amazing.

2136
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:02,640
These guys could find their way.

2137
00:54:03,470 --> 00:54:05,190
They map everything with the shadows.

2138
00:54:05,191 --> 00:54:09,270
So at mid day you don't walk anywhere
because you can't see where you're going.

2139
00:54:09,540 --> 00:54:13,140
So with mid day they stopped and they put
a stick in the ground and then we have

2140
00:54:13,141 --> 00:54:16,070
a snack and you watched a
stick and when the shadows,

2141
00:54:16,130 --> 00:54:16,441
okay,

2142
00:54:16,441 --> 00:54:17,370
now we can go again.

2143
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:18,340
Ah,

2144
00:54:18,340 --> 00:54:19,060
yeah.

2145
00:54:19,060 --> 00:54:19,893
That's cool.

2146
00:54:20,220 --> 00:54:20,881
That's fucking,

2147
00:54:20,881 --> 00:54:22,200
why not bring a compass?

2148
00:54:22,350 --> 00:54:23,280
They're not hard to get.

2149
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:24,190
I don't know.

2150
00:54:24,190 --> 00:54:24,820
Well yeah,

2151
00:54:24,820 --> 00:54:26,970
was a lot of stuff I would
have done differently.

2152
00:54:28,150 --> 00:54:28,983
In hindsight,

2153
00:54:30,250 --> 00:54:31,083
it's easy to get

2154
00:54:31,770 --> 00:54:32,091
green.

2155
00:54:32,091 --> 00:54:33,060
Hell for sure.

2156
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:34,980
And what if it rains for a couple of days?

2157
00:54:35,010 --> 00:54:36,120
You know you're no shadows.

2158
00:54:36,150 --> 00:54:36,421
Yeah.

2159
00:54:36,421 --> 00:54:36,810
Yeah.

2160
00:54:36,810 --> 00:54:38,430
You sit under your blue
tarp and all that shit.

2161
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:39,030
Wait,

2162
00:54:39,030 --> 00:54:39,660
yeah,

2163
00:54:39,660 --> 00:54:40,493
the fence.

2164
00:54:41,580 --> 00:54:41,971
Good for you,

2165
00:54:41,971 --> 00:54:42,151
Jay.

2166
00:54:42,151 --> 00:54:42,840
You should go.

2167
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:43,380
Yeah,

2168
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:44,070
I'm ready.

2169
00:54:44,070 --> 00:54:44,820
Sign me up.

2170
00:54:44,820 --> 00:54:45,780
How much weight did you lose?

2171
00:54:46,170 --> 00:54:47,003
A lot.

2172
00:54:47,060 --> 00:54:47,580
Yeah.

2173
00:54:47,580 --> 00:54:49,830
I mean after I'd been eating to come back,

2174
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:52,260
I don't get ribbed.

2175
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:53,640
I get skinnier and fatter.

2176
00:54:53,940 --> 00:54:54,750
That's what happens to me.

2177
00:54:54,750 --> 00:54:55,583
That's funny.

2178
00:54:55,620 --> 00:54:56,550
What did you guys eat?

2179
00:54:57,760 --> 00:54:58,440
We ate,

2180
00:54:58,440 --> 00:54:59,040
we brought,

2181
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:00,450
they brought again like it was,

2182
00:55:00,690 --> 00:55:02,410
it wasn't a perfectly planned trip.

2183
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:04,080
They told me everything was fine,

2184
00:55:04,081 --> 00:55:04,920
but I could have brought,

2185
00:55:04,921 --> 00:55:05,160
you know,

2186
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:09,150
waterfall over pumps and instead I had
to boil my water the whole time cause

2187
00:55:09,151 --> 00:55:09,510
they were like,

2188
00:55:09,510 --> 00:55:11,010
oh we got it and they don't got it.

2189
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:11,250
You know.

2190
00:55:11,250 --> 00:55:15,090
So I had to miss stop and make a little
fire to boil and then carry water and I

2191
00:55:15,091 --> 00:55:16,260
was carrying water and coke,

2192
00:55:16,290 --> 00:55:16,710
you know,

2193
00:55:16,710 --> 00:55:17,543
coke bottles.

2194
00:55:17,830 --> 00:55:18,270
Oh it was,

2195
00:55:18,270 --> 00:55:19,103
I didn't bring any,

2196
00:55:19,170 --> 00:55:19,650
you know,

2197
00:55:19,650 --> 00:55:20,910
any now jeans or anything like that.

2198
00:55:20,940 --> 00:55:21,770
Oh Jesus.

2199
00:55:21,770 --> 00:55:23,040
Cause they told me they had it off it,

2200
00:55:23,041 --> 00:55:23,201
you know,

2201
00:55:23,201 --> 00:55:24,120
it was all taken care of.

2202
00:55:24,310 --> 00:55:24,450
Yeah.

2203
00:55:24,450 --> 00:55:26,380
That was the idea of all taken care.

2204
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:26,680
Yeah.

2205
00:55:26,680 --> 00:55:27,120
They don't care.

2206
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:27,851
Just the water is there.

2207
00:55:27,851 --> 00:55:28,684
Like what's it like?

2208
00:55:29,370 --> 00:55:30,001
It was so funny.

2209
00:55:30,001 --> 00:55:30,181
Right.

2210
00:55:30,181 --> 00:55:30,870
So these guys,

2211
00:55:30,870 --> 00:55:31,081
they're,

2212
00:55:31,081 --> 00:55:32,910
they're in there basically Indio guys.

2213
00:55:32,911 --> 00:55:33,744
And they were like,

2214
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:35,071
one of them was like,

2215
00:55:35,071 --> 00:55:36,360
so you've been to the ocean,

2216
00:55:36,361 --> 00:55:36,550
right?

2217
00:55:36,550 --> 00:55:36,850
I'm like,

2218
00:55:36,850 --> 00:55:37,683
yeah,

2219
00:55:37,860 --> 00:55:38,071
he's like,

2220
00:55:38,071 --> 00:55:38,731
it's salt water.

2221
00:55:38,731 --> 00:55:39,150
Right?

2222
00:55:39,150 --> 00:55:39,630
And I'm like,

2223
00:55:39,630 --> 00:55:40,463
Yup.

2224
00:55:40,740 --> 00:55:41,573
And he's like,

2225
00:55:41,790 --> 00:55:42,490
you don't drink it.

2226
00:55:42,490 --> 00:55:42,751
I'm like,

2227
00:55:42,751 --> 00:55:42,871
no,

2228
00:55:42,871 --> 00:55:44,820
you can't drink the salt
water cause you'll kill you.

2229
00:55:45,570 --> 00:55:47,400
And he kind of looked at
me like I was a pussy.

2230
00:55:47,401 --> 00:55:48,234
Like he was like,

2231
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:49,193
hmm.

2232
00:55:51,510 --> 00:55:51,980
Yeah,

2233
00:55:51,980 --> 00:55:53,870
I mean look at you and you're like,

2234
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,220
I can't drink the water here.

2235
00:55:55,221 --> 00:55:56,070
You can't ignore it there.

2236
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:58,520
Like they can just drink the river water,

2237
00:55:58,890 --> 00:55:59,420
just drink it.

2238
00:55:59,420 --> 00:56:00,253
They grew up there.

2239
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:02,481
What do they live to be?

2240
00:56:02,481 --> 00:56:02,961
20.

2241
00:56:02,961 --> 00:56:03,650
How old?

2242
00:56:03,650 --> 00:56:04,421
How old are they get?

2243
00:56:04,421 --> 00:56:05,390
It's crazy because some of them

2244
00:56:05,470 --> 00:56:05,801
there was,

2245
00:56:05,801 --> 00:56:06,070
uh,

2246
00:56:06,070 --> 00:56:08,080
the one really dangerous
thing is the snakes.

2247
00:56:08,081 --> 00:56:10,360
The fertile lance is like the
most poisonous snake in the world.

2248
00:56:10,361 --> 00:56:10,651
It's like,

2249
00:56:10,651 --> 00:56:10,990
you know,

2250
00:56:10,990 --> 00:56:11,890
turn your heart off.

2251
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:12,730
What's it called?

2252
00:56:12,730 --> 00:56:14,740
The for the lance fern,

2253
00:56:14,741 --> 00:56:14,980
f.

2254
00:56:14,980 --> 00:56:16,660
E.

2255
00:56:16,660 --> 00:56:16,660
R.

2256
00:56:16,660 --> 00:56:16,660
N.

2257
00:56:16,660 --> 00:56:16,660
D.

2258
00:56:16,660 --> 00:56:17,493
Lance.

2259
00:56:17,750 --> 00:56:18,700
It looks like a snake,

2260
00:56:18,701 --> 00:56:18,911
you know,

2261
00:56:18,911 --> 00:56:19,060
like,

2262
00:56:19,060 --> 00:56:19,220
uh,

2263
00:56:19,220 --> 00:56:20,440
I dunno if it was sneaky.

2264
00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:21,340
Um,

2265
00:56:21,340 --> 00:56:22,060
did you see one?

2266
00:56:22,060 --> 00:56:22,700
Yeah,

2267
00:56:22,700 --> 00:56:26,650
he killed one right by the camera and
I'm walking on my flip flops at night.

2268
00:56:26,770 --> 00:56:27,340
Right.

2269
00:56:27,340 --> 00:56:29,770
And they killed one
within five feet of camp.

2270
00:56:30,470 --> 00:56:32,260
You have to kill him cause
they're so dangerous.

2271
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:33,890
And these guys all had the,

2272
00:56:33,940 --> 00:56:34,271
Oh yeah,

2273
00:56:34,271 --> 00:56:35,590
my friend got been died.

2274
00:56:35,620 --> 00:56:36,700
This guy didn't die,

2275
00:56:36,701 --> 00:56:37,211
but you know,

2276
00:56:37,211 --> 00:56:39,850
and we were three or four
days from a hospital.

2277
00:56:40,330 --> 00:56:41,163
Whoa.

2278
00:56:41,230 --> 00:56:41,950
So you're just,

2279
00:56:41,950 --> 00:56:42,910
it's luck of the draw,

2280
00:56:42,911 --> 00:56:43,460
you know,

2281
00:56:43,460 --> 00:56:44,530
with the snake will bite you.

2282
00:56:44,531 --> 00:56:47,020
And then sometimes it'll put a ton of
poisoning and sometimes those two a

2283
00:56:47,021 --> 00:56:47,854
little,

2284
00:56:47,950 --> 00:56:48,490
and it's sort of,

2285
00:56:48,490 --> 00:56:49,540
that's why some people can,

2286
00:56:49,570 --> 00:56:49,960
oh,

2287
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:50,410
he's tough.

2288
00:56:50,410 --> 00:56:51,880
He survived getting bit by a rattlesnake.

2289
00:56:51,950 --> 00:56:52,750
I didn't,

2290
00:56:52,750 --> 00:56:54,610
it just didn't give them
the full dose basically.

2291
00:56:54,611 --> 00:56:57,400
And it could be an older
rattlesnake or it could be around,

2292
00:56:57,401 --> 00:56:58,290
just make that already stuck.

2293
00:56:58,291 --> 00:56:59,410
Something like recently,

2294
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:01,030
and the babies don't have that power.

2295
00:57:01,031 --> 00:57:01,810
So babies are more,

2296
00:57:01,810 --> 00:57:02,410
they don't,

2297
00:57:02,410 --> 00:57:03,400
they always give a full dose.

2298
00:57:03,401 --> 00:57:04,480
That's why they're more dangerous.

2299
00:57:04,780 --> 00:57:07,480
Young rattlesnakes are the most
dangerous because they don't regulate it.

2300
00:57:07,481 --> 00:57:08,470
They just hit you with everything.

2301
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:11,230
There's a crazy photo sort of,

2302
00:57:11,231 --> 00:57:11,860
um,

2303
00:57:11,860 --> 00:57:15,670
blog online of a guy who got bit by
a rattlesnake and then had all these

2304
00:57:15,671 --> 00:57:17,380
operations to,

2305
00:57:17,410 --> 00:57:17,770
to,

2306
00:57:17,770 --> 00:57:18,700
to heal the area.

2307
00:57:18,770 --> 00:57:20,690
[inaudible]

2308
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:22,080
every time.

2309
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:22,200
Yeah,

2310
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:23,710
your body just rots away.

2311
00:57:23,711 --> 00:57:24,880
Like a lot of people don't realize,

2312
00:57:24,881 --> 00:57:27,160
like when that venom goes inside of you,

2313
00:57:27,161 --> 00:57:27,941
it doesn't just like,

2314
00:57:27,941 --> 00:57:28,341
oh my God,

2315
00:57:28,341 --> 00:57:29,280
are you going to be sick for a while?

2316
00:57:29,540 --> 00:57:30,900
But your arms going to run,

2317
00:57:30,901 --> 00:57:32,260
I'm going to damage and all this.

2318
00:57:32,261 --> 00:57:32,460
Yeah.

2319
00:57:32,460 --> 00:57:37,460
To get like all these operations and skin
grafts and shit and really scared of,

2320
00:57:37,900 --> 00:57:38,021
well,

2321
00:57:38,021 --> 00:57:39,900
the fertile and is like
a hard stop or whatever,

2322
00:57:39,910 --> 00:57:40,091
you know,

2323
00:57:40,091 --> 00:57:40,301
whatever.

2324
00:57:40,301 --> 00:57:41,134
I forget,

2325
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:42,281
I forget what it's called,

2326
00:57:42,281 --> 00:57:42,581
but yeah,

2327
00:57:42,581 --> 00:57:45,100
it just shuts down your cardio machine.

2328
00:57:45,101 --> 00:57:47,470
And this is the Amazon in Peru.

2329
00:57:47,471 --> 00:57:48,304
Is this where you were at?

2330
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:49,270
So it was in the d,

2331
00:57:49,270 --> 00:57:50,890
the headwaters of the Amazon in Peru.

2332
00:57:50,891 --> 00:57:53,200
And then there's a lot of a
bunch of the Amazons and Peru,

2333
00:57:53,201 --> 00:57:55,930
and that was the Amazon
is so fucking massive,

2334
00:57:56,140 --> 00:57:57,010
but it's incredible,

2335
00:57:57,011 --> 00:57:57,460
isn't it?

2336
00:57:57,460 --> 00:57:59,920
Like being deforested and a scary,

2337
00:57:59,921 --> 00:58:00,754
scary rate.

2338
00:58:00,910 --> 00:58:01,300
No,

2339
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:02,051
it's totally,

2340
00:58:02,051 --> 00:58:03,610
and what was interesting
too is these guys,

2341
00:58:03,611 --> 00:58:04,444
so there was a,

2342
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:06,490
we went to get some
fruit and they were like,

2343
00:58:06,550 --> 00:58:08,230
they just chop down the
tree to get the fruit right.

2344
00:58:08,231 --> 00:58:08,501
You know,

2345
00:58:08,501 --> 00:58:09,600
like they don't climb up it,

2346
00:58:09,601 --> 00:58:09,910
you know?

2347
00:58:09,910 --> 00:58:10,743
Right.

2348
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:11,471
And,

2349
00:58:11,471 --> 00:58:11,980
uh,

2350
00:58:11,980 --> 00:58:12,221
you know,

2351
00:58:12,221 --> 00:58:12,491
I was like,

2352
00:58:12,491 --> 00:58:12,870
well,

2353
00:58:12,870 --> 00:58:13,250
isn't,

2354
00:58:13,250 --> 00:58:17,620
isn't that seem kind of counterpart in
their defense that the trees grow fast,

2355
00:58:17,621 --> 00:58:17,801
you know,

2356
00:58:17,801 --> 00:58:19,450
eight years it's a full tree because it's,

2357
00:58:19,510 --> 00:58:20,860
and they it down with the machetes.

2358
00:58:20,861 --> 00:58:21,640
Yeah.

2359
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:22,760
But in their mind that,

2360
00:58:22,780 --> 00:58:23,050
you know,

2361
00:58:23,050 --> 00:58:25,150
it's like the jungle is endless,

2362
00:58:25,330 --> 00:58:25,601
you know,

2363
00:58:25,601 --> 00:58:27,640
like that's how they see the jungle.

2364
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:32,140
And then you look at the pictures of the
fish market in Cusco and the fish used

2365
00:58:32,141 --> 00:58:34,300
to be six feet long and
now they're all this long.

2366
00:58:34,390 --> 00:58:35,100
You know what I mean?

2367
00:58:35,100 --> 00:58:35,400
And,

2368
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:35,900
and,

2369
00:58:35,900 --> 00:58:36,260
and,

2370
00:58:36,260 --> 00:58:37,160
and these guys wouldn't like,

2371
00:58:37,510 --> 00:58:37,811
they go,

2372
00:58:37,811 --> 00:58:38,051
oh yeah,

2373
00:58:38,051 --> 00:58:40,660
we have to walk farther and
farther to get the tree.

2374
00:58:41,580 --> 00:58:42,280
Yeah.

2375
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:45,550
You cut them down and I'd like it doesn't,

2376
00:58:45,551 --> 00:58:46,061
you know what I mean?

2377
00:58:46,061 --> 00:58:50,410
Like in their heads it's limitless and
I can never be finished or whatever.

2378
00:58:50,411 --> 00:58:52,250
I guess the psychology of living in an,

2379
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:53,430
in someplace,

2380
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:54,161
I see Amazon,

2381
00:58:54,161 --> 00:58:54,590
it's like,

2382
00:58:54,590 --> 00:58:54,810
dude,

2383
00:58:54,810 --> 00:58:55,480
listen,

2384
00:58:55,480 --> 00:58:56,500
that's the last thing.

2385
00:58:56,501 --> 00:58:58,150
You have to worry about
this stuff going away.

2386
00:58:58,180 --> 00:59:01,630
The resources are endless and just
got to figure out how to stay alive.

2387
00:59:01,690 --> 00:59:02,523
Yeah.

2388
00:59:02,590 --> 00:59:03,423
Wow.

2389
00:59:03,490 --> 00:59:05,440
You've ever read that book
collapse by Jared diamond?

2390
00:59:05,650 --> 00:59:06,400
Yeah,

2391
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:07,450
cause he's the guy who wrote guns,

2392
00:59:07,451 --> 00:59:08,380
germs and steel.

2393
00:59:08,770 --> 00:59:11,110
And he wrote a book about
why society fail like the,

2394
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:11,441
you know,

2395
00:59:11,441 --> 00:59:11,740
which,

2396
00:59:11,740 --> 00:59:14,020
which I got into a little
bit in disaster diaries,

2397
00:59:14,021 --> 00:59:14,854
which was,

2398
00:59:15,070 --> 00:59:15,251
you know,

2399
00:59:15,251 --> 00:59:19,330
it's about why the Vikings had a
colony in Greenland that died out.

2400
00:59:19,330 --> 00:59:20,980
Or Easter Island for instance.

2401
00:59:20,990 --> 00:59:22,010
What happened there?

2402
00:59:22,490 --> 00:59:23,323
Aliens,

2403
00:59:23,510 --> 00:59:23,871
right?

2404
00:59:23,871 --> 00:59:24,920
I'm not saying it's aliens,

2405
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:28,940
but why did their heads
look like that man?

2406
00:59:29,540 --> 00:59:30,200
Clearly.

2407
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:31,040
Clearly aliens.

2408
00:59:31,060 --> 00:59:33,830
Is it possible you ever
watch ancient aliens?

2409
00:59:34,190 --> 00:59:35,690
Whenever Giorgio sucralose,

2410
00:59:35,691 --> 00:59:36,351
who's a good buddy?

2411
00:59:36,351 --> 00:59:37,430
He's been on the show a couple times,

2412
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:38,600
but whenever he goes,

2413
00:59:38,870 --> 00:59:40,160
is it possible?

2414
00:59:40,560 --> 00:59:42,650
It's got to go all I know it's coming.

2415
00:59:42,690 --> 00:59:43,370
Oh No.

2416
00:59:43,370 --> 00:59:44,203
What are you going to say?

2417
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:46,610
Deep flood isn't alien.

2418
00:59:47,870 --> 00:59:48,111
Yes.

2419
00:59:48,111 --> 00:59:48,771
That is possible.

2420
00:59:48,771 --> 00:59:49,490
It is possible.

2421
00:59:49,490 --> 00:59:50,420
Everything's possible.

2422
00:59:51,020 --> 00:59:52,040
If were possible.

2423
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:53,390
If humans are possible,

2424
00:59:53,570 --> 00:59:54,770
virtually everything's possible.

2425
00:59:54,830 --> 00:59:56,930
Did they know who the
fuck was on Easter Island?

2426
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:57,530
Uh,

2427
00:59:57,530 --> 00:59:57,921
yeah,

2428
00:59:57,921 --> 00:59:58,011
they,

2429
00:59:58,011 --> 00:59:59,620
it was these know Polynesian.

2430
00:59:59,630 --> 01:00:02,030
I mean that's what so let me
look at like pack rat bins,

2431
01:00:02,031 --> 01:00:02,271
which,

2432
01:00:02,271 --> 01:00:03,051
which are like these,

2433
01:00:03,051 --> 01:00:03,884
uh,

2434
01:00:04,040 --> 01:00:04,581
pack rats.

2435
01:00:04,581 --> 01:00:07,820
They collect stuff and they can sort
of see what's going on with the foliage

2436
01:00:08,180 --> 01:00:09,680
cause it kind of fossilized or whatever.

2437
01:00:10,250 --> 01:00:11,120
And uh,

2438
01:00:12,170 --> 01:00:12,471
and I,

2439
01:00:12,471 --> 01:00:13,510
I've eaten background by the way.

2440
01:00:13,511 --> 01:00:13,830
It's real.

2441
01:00:13,830 --> 01:00:14,663
It's delicious.

2442
01:00:14,890 --> 01:00:15,710
Is Delicious.

2443
01:00:15,710 --> 01:00:16,490
Delicious.

2444
01:00:16,490 --> 01:00:19,490
Really Savory is gave me
like a venison almost.

2445
01:00:19,700 --> 01:00:20,570
No kidding.

2446
01:00:20,630 --> 01:00:21,463
Where'd you get it?

2447
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:25,910
I was trapping them in Kansas
and they're like little beavers.

2448
01:00:25,970 --> 01:00:26,900
They're not like rats.

2449
01:00:26,901 --> 01:00:28,580
They're like little hairy little guys.

2450
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:30,630
So a pack rat is not like a week,

2451
01:00:31,700 --> 01:00:34,480
but does it look like
around like a big rat?

2452
01:00:34,520 --> 01:00:34,731
Yeah,

2453
01:00:34,731 --> 01:00:35,430
big hairy ran.

2454
01:00:35,430 --> 01:00:36,263
What's their diet?

2455
01:00:36,590 --> 01:00:39,230
They eat grass and
whatever they find around,

2456
01:00:39,231 --> 01:00:39,500
you know,

2457
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:40,670
and they make these little mittens,

2458
01:00:40,671 --> 01:00:40,911
which,

2459
01:00:40,911 --> 01:00:41,240
which,

2460
01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:42,470
you know what I heard mid and I'm like,

2461
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:42,651
Oh,

2462
01:00:42,651 --> 01:00:42,921
what is it?

2463
01:00:42,921 --> 01:00:43,590
Like a whole number,

2464
01:00:43,590 --> 01:00:44,640
but it's like a little beaver lodge.

2465
01:00:44,641 --> 01:00:45,411
It's like a small one,

2466
01:00:45,411 --> 01:00:47,510
like a two foot high collection of sticks,

2467
01:00:47,511 --> 01:00:48,380
like in a pile.

2468
01:00:48,770 --> 01:00:52,060
And I learned how to make these little
dead fall traps and you put a little

2469
01:00:52,070 --> 01:00:52,760
peanut butter,

2470
01:00:52,760 --> 01:00:53,031
you know,

2471
01:00:53,031 --> 01:00:53,361
on the,

2472
01:00:53,361 --> 01:00:53,900
on the end.

2473
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:57,260
And he comes in and gets under the
rock and it smashes and it kills them.

2474
01:00:57,920 --> 01:00:58,340
Yeah.

2475
01:00:58,340 --> 01:01:01,820
I've seen those dead fault traps on
like survivor man and shit like that.

2476
01:01:01,830 --> 01:01:04,000
It's one of those things has
come totally counterintuitive.

2477
01:01:04,010 --> 01:01:07,220
Like I could give you the pieces and you
would never in a million years be like,

2478
01:01:07,221 --> 01:01:07,790
cause it's,

2479
01:01:07,790 --> 01:01:09,410
it makes sense once you do it once.

2480
01:01:09,411 --> 01:01:10,700
That's why it's not even worth explaining.

2481
01:01:10,701 --> 01:01:11,990
Cause it's like I could
show you and you'd be like,

2482
01:01:12,020 --> 01:01:12,500
Oh yeah,

2483
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:12,711
yeah,

2484
01:01:12,711 --> 01:01:13,544
I can easily do that.

2485
01:01:14,210 --> 01:01:15,830
But to talk about it as like a,

2486
01:01:15,831 --> 01:01:16,760
so the stick goes wrong.

2487
01:01:16,780 --> 01:01:17,010
You know,

2488
01:01:17,010 --> 01:01:18,500
it's simple,

2489
01:01:18,501 --> 01:01:18,800
but it's,

2490
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:19,520
it's um,

2491
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:20,450
it's tricky enough.

2492
01:01:20,540 --> 01:01:21,860
I'm a survivor man fan,

2493
01:01:21,861 --> 01:01:23,390
so I've seen that show
like a hundred times.

2494
01:01:23,410 --> 01:01:23,870
Yeah.

2495
01:01:23,870 --> 01:01:24,560
But I,

2496
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:25,550
I've seen him make those.

2497
01:01:25,580 --> 01:01:26,570
I have no idea how to make one.

2498
01:01:26,660 --> 01:01:27,493
If I had to make one,

2499
01:01:27,530 --> 01:01:28,290
make it yourself.

2500
01:01:28,290 --> 01:01:31,310
All this stuff you have to
kind of do once at least,

2501
01:01:31,340 --> 01:01:31,731
you know,

2502
01:01:31,731 --> 01:01:32,900
and then you sort of,

2503
01:01:33,530 --> 01:01:34,580
it's like the nuclear button.

2504
01:01:34,581 --> 01:01:35,480
Once you know what's possible,

2505
01:01:36,090 --> 01:01:37,100
you can do it right.

2506
01:01:37,101 --> 01:01:37,934
But four minute mile,

2507
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:38,420
you know,

2508
01:01:38,420 --> 01:01:38,650
let,

2509
01:01:38,650 --> 01:01:41,750
let Straub but started with
John Macpherson who is the
guy I was with in Kansas.

2510
01:01:41,770 --> 01:01:42,603
Oh that's how he learned.

2511
01:01:43,410 --> 01:01:43,880
Well one,

2512
01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:44,151
you know,

2513
01:01:44,151 --> 01:01:45,320
not only place but one of the,

2514
01:01:45,321 --> 01:01:49,220
he came there early on in his career and
so this guy has like an old school guy.

2515
01:01:49,221 --> 01:01:49,960
He's been around forever.

2516
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:53,300
What we did was you trapping
pack rats a part of this book.

2517
01:01:53,390 --> 01:01:53,720
Yeah,

2518
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:54,120
it's in there.

2519
01:01:54,120 --> 01:01:54,410
Yup.

2520
01:01:54,410 --> 01:01:54,630
Yeah.

2521
01:01:54,630 --> 01:01:56,570
I caught a couple rats and yeah,

2522
01:01:56,571 --> 01:01:57,440
just learning to do it,

2523
01:01:57,441 --> 01:01:57,591
you know,

2524
01:01:57,591 --> 01:02:00,020
and I went out every day and set up,

2525
01:02:00,050 --> 01:02:00,381
you know,

2526
01:02:00,381 --> 01:02:02,540
set up and you're in the
hot sun and you know,

2527
01:02:02,541 --> 01:02:02,961
it's like,

2528
01:02:02,961 --> 01:02:06,530
it's almost like it took me back to my
childhood and that weird way of like,

2529
01:02:06,531 --> 01:02:06,681
you know,

2530
01:02:06,681 --> 01:02:09,950
he used to like build forts for your
like Gi joes and shit in the backyard

2531
01:02:10,370 --> 01:02:13,490
because you don't get down and fiddle
with shit in the grass anymore.

2532
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:14,300
Like that doesn't,

2533
01:02:14,300 --> 01:02:15,410
that's not something you do.

2534
01:02:15,470 --> 01:02:15,980
It's true.

2535
01:02:15,980 --> 01:02:20,080
And a lot of this survival stuff was
this kind of move back like a primitive,

2536
01:02:20,590 --> 01:02:21,880
like you have all day,

2537
01:02:21,910 --> 01:02:22,181
you know,

2538
01:02:22,181 --> 01:02:23,720
you're not doing anything else a day.

2539
01:02:24,430 --> 01:02:25,960
You're not fucking check in your phone.

2540
01:02:25,961 --> 01:02:27,070
Like you're not doing it an email.

2541
01:02:27,071 --> 01:02:30,310
Like you're going to make fire today
and it may take you three days,

2542
01:02:30,311 --> 01:02:31,610
but like you go out and,

2543
01:02:32,220 --> 01:02:32,891
and it's,

2544
01:02:32,891 --> 01:02:36,490
it's interesting to kind of get
into this other kind of time,

2545
01:02:36,520 --> 01:02:37,030
you know,

2546
01:02:37,030 --> 01:02:39,100
a sense of time and stuff like that.

2547
01:02:39,101 --> 01:02:39,740
It's really fun.

2548
01:02:39,740 --> 01:02:41,450
One of the things that high moe said,

2549
01:02:41,451 --> 01:02:45,830
the guy who lived a up in the Arctic or
is that he believes that the problems of

2550
01:02:45,831 --> 01:02:48,170
society come from the fact that we're,

2551
01:02:48,171 --> 01:02:51,020
we're basically at nature
hunters and gatherers.

2552
01:02:51,410 --> 01:02:56,410
And when we remove ourselves from
that and put ourself in the Sea of

2553
01:02:58,140 --> 01:03:00,950
possibilities of modern society than
100% Nigeria crazy for said it fucks us

2554
01:03:00,951 --> 01:03:01,784
100% okay.

2555
01:03:01,850 --> 01:03:02,301
So yeah,

2556
01:03:02,301 --> 01:03:02,600
we,

2557
01:03:02,600 --> 01:03:05,360
we were hunter gatherers
living in small groups.

2558
01:03:05,930 --> 01:03:07,670
So if the human history is a book,

2559
01:03:07,671 --> 01:03:08,360
right?

2560
01:03:08,360 --> 01:03:11,060
We were hunters and we were living in
tiny little family groups and hunting,

2561
01:03:11,061 --> 01:03:13,610
gathering for 200 pages of that book.

2562
01:03:14,150 --> 01:03:18,110
And then four paragraphs
is the modern world,

2563
01:03:18,170 --> 01:03:18,681
you know what I mean?

2564
01:03:18,681 --> 01:03:21,080
Is it's knowing for progress
is just civilization.

2565
01:03:21,081 --> 01:03:24,290
And then like the last sentence
is the last two centuries.

2566
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:27,620
So that's how on like unequipped,

2567
01:03:27,621 --> 01:03:32,240
we are on an evolutionary
scale to handle cars.

2568
01:03:32,390 --> 01:03:32,840
You're,

2569
01:03:32,840 --> 01:03:33,230
you know,

2570
01:03:33,230 --> 01:03:34,490
running a nuclear power plant.

2571
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:35,000
Twitter.

2572
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:35,260
Yeah.

2573
01:03:35,260 --> 01:03:36,470
Twitter is the stock market,

2574
01:03:36,500 --> 01:03:37,071
all that shit.

2575
01:03:37,071 --> 01:03:42,071
Like you're just intuitively like your
gut reaction to all that shit is not

2576
01:03:42,621 --> 01:03:43,190
valid.

2577
01:03:43,190 --> 01:03:43,701
You know what I mean?

2578
01:03:43,701 --> 01:03:44,090
Like you,

2579
01:03:44,090 --> 01:03:45,350
your reaction to a person,

2580
01:03:45,351 --> 01:03:46,040
it's pretty good.

2581
01:03:46,040 --> 01:03:48,290
Like you're good at reading
people and getting like a feeling,

2582
01:03:48,310 --> 01:03:49,400
oh he makes me nervous.

2583
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:50,600
Avoid that guy.

2584
01:03:51,260 --> 01:03:52,130
But uh,

2585
01:03:52,580 --> 01:03:53,450
the big system,

2586
01:03:53,451 --> 01:03:55,270
so like all those like
stock mark guys are like,

2587
01:03:55,271 --> 01:03:55,350
oh,

2588
01:03:55,350 --> 01:03:56,540
I had a feeling like you got lucky.

2589
01:03:56,541 --> 01:03:57,440
That's all it happened,

2590
01:03:57,441 --> 01:03:57,681
dude.

2591
01:03:57,681 --> 01:03:58,330
You know?

2592
01:03:58,330 --> 01:03:59,163
Yeah,

2593
01:03:59,300 --> 01:03:59,511
yeah.

2594
01:03:59,511 --> 01:04:04,511
It's a very strange situation
where obviously the world
is changing forever and

2595
01:04:05,210 --> 01:04:07,520
our biology is taking a long time,

2596
01:04:07,540 --> 01:04:08,210
can't catch up,

2597
01:04:08,210 --> 01:04:09,043
catch up.

2598
01:04:09,170 --> 01:04:10,520
And how does that work?

2599
01:04:10,521 --> 01:04:11,450
Does it ever catch up?

2600
01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:12,261
I don't think it does.

2601
01:04:12,261 --> 01:04:12,800
I Dunno.

2602
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:14,660
Do you think that's what autism is?

2603
01:04:14,661 --> 01:04:16,850
Do you think that's what
a lot of diseases are?

2604
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:17,311
Is that low?

2605
01:04:17,311 --> 01:04:22,130
The body's like scrambling to try to
figure out a way to survive this strange

2606
01:04:22,131 --> 01:04:22,560
time

2607
01:04:22,560 --> 01:04:24,840
or just random mutation and you know,

2608
01:04:24,841 --> 01:04:26,950
with evolution is meditation and

2609
01:04:27,050 --> 01:04:27,570
yeah,

2610
01:04:27,570 --> 01:04:29,060
an adaptation adaptation.

2611
01:04:29,061 --> 01:04:29,894
Due to that.

2612
01:04:30,050 --> 01:04:31,910
One of the things that I read about,

2613
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:32,270
um,

2614
01:04:32,270 --> 01:04:36,500
autism was that the be
the need for emotions.

2615
01:04:36,501 --> 01:04:38,750
Like when we become
symbiotic with machines,

2616
01:04:38,780 --> 01:04:39,510
right?

2617
01:04:39,510 --> 01:04:42,200
That it's not going to
the need for emotions.

2618
01:04:42,201 --> 01:04:43,950
It's going to be essentially removed,

2619
01:04:43,970 --> 01:04:44,310
right?

2620
01:04:44,310 --> 01:04:49,040
Like we've already are like
a lot of our reward systems,

2621
01:04:49,041 --> 01:04:49,481
like the,

2622
01:04:49,481 --> 01:04:53,900
the reason why hunting and gathering
is so exciting and so fulfilling.

2623
01:04:53,901 --> 01:04:55,670
It's because that's what's
necessary to survive.

2624
01:04:55,990 --> 01:04:56,350
If you,

2625
01:04:56,350 --> 01:04:56,960
you've,

2626
01:04:56,960 --> 01:04:57,741
you've fished before,

2627
01:04:57,741 --> 01:04:59,810
I'm sure you know that
feeling when you catch a fish,

2628
01:05:00,050 --> 01:05:00,980
God and you reel it in.

2629
01:05:00,981 --> 01:05:01,370
Yeah,

2630
01:05:01,370 --> 01:05:02,450
it's very live.

2631
01:05:02,590 --> 01:05:03,423
You're going to live,

2632
01:05:03,580 --> 01:05:05,060
it's like really primal.

2633
01:05:05,250 --> 01:05:07,400
So it's a weird thing
when you know you've made,

2634
01:05:07,610 --> 01:05:10,370
you've got an animal that you
just caught and it's going to get,

2635
01:05:10,371 --> 01:05:14,980
provide you with sustenance is
a very strange sort of a psych.

2636
01:05:15,020 --> 01:05:17,490
It's goes back to your genes electric.

2637
01:05:17,500 --> 01:05:17,971
Yeah.

2638
01:05:17,971 --> 01:05:18,210
It's

2639
01:05:18,210 --> 01:05:20,340
very electric and it's hard to describe.

2640
01:05:20,520 --> 01:05:21,150
Yeah.

2641
01:05:21,150 --> 01:05:21,630
Um,

2642
01:05:21,630 --> 01:05:23,550
those jolts and those,

2643
01:05:23,580 --> 01:05:27,150
those positive feelings that you get
from that hunter and gatherer thing,

2644
01:05:27,540 --> 01:05:28,950
eventually we're not going
to need that anymore.

2645
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:29,670
When you,

2646
01:05:29,670 --> 01:05:30,570
everything is like,

2647
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:34,380
have you seen that Japanese guy that
figured out a way how to make steak out of

2648
01:05:34,381 --> 01:05:35,520
human feces?

2649
01:05:37,670 --> 01:05:38,490
Delicious,

2650
01:05:38,490 --> 01:05:39,540
delicious steak?

2651
01:05:39,541 --> 01:05:40,231
I'm not joking.

2652
01:05:40,231 --> 01:05:40,860
All right.

2653
01:05:40,860 --> 01:05:42,180
I just tweeted it.

2654
01:05:42,210 --> 01:05:42,480
Uh,

2655
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:44,250
somebody tweeted it to me and I retweet.

2656
01:05:44,251 --> 01:05:46,530
It wasn't even fucking believe it is true.

2657
01:05:46,560 --> 01:05:49,440
Why would you even go with the steak
versus I would try like it like a risotto

2658
01:05:49,441 --> 01:05:51,180
first before I went right for us because

2659
01:05:51,790 --> 01:05:52,623
steak is meat.

2660
01:05:52,920 --> 01:05:53,753
Um,

2661
01:05:54,620 --> 01:05:55,230
yeah.

2662
01:05:55,230 --> 01:05:55,590
I don't know.

2663
01:05:55,590 --> 01:05:56,650
I'm going to touch that one.

2664
01:05:56,651 --> 01:05:57,370
I don't know why.

2665
01:05:57,370 --> 01:05:57,701
Yeah,

2666
01:05:57,701 --> 01:05:58,570
I don't know either.

2667
01:05:58,660 --> 01:05:59,380
But it's,

2668
01:05:59,380 --> 01:05:59,920
yeah.

2669
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:00,731
Crazy though.

2670
01:06:00,731 --> 01:06:01,091
This,

2671
01:06:01,091 --> 01:06:03,070
this guy figured out a way to,

2672
01:06:03,130 --> 01:06:06,630
to actually make meat out of the proteins,

2673
01:06:06,940 --> 01:06:08,750
nutritional value left in your fees.

2674
01:06:08,770 --> 01:06:09,220
Well,

2675
01:06:09,220 --> 01:06:13,570
it's definitely like your feces is
pretty because our diets are so rich.

2676
01:06:13,930 --> 01:06:17,080
You're not taking all the nutritional
value out of your waste that you should

2677
01:06:17,081 --> 01:06:17,590
be.

2678
01:06:17,590 --> 01:06:17,861
Yeah,

2679
01:06:17,861 --> 01:06:18,760
I guess so.

2680
01:06:18,761 --> 01:06:19,830
If you were starving your,

2681
01:06:20,120 --> 01:06:22,240
your feces would be a
lot less nutritional.

2682
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:23,590
But even then,

2683
01:06:23,591 --> 01:06:24,160
I mean,

2684
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:27,340
how efficient is the human
digestive digestive tract?

2685
01:06:27,900 --> 01:06:28,151
I don't,

2686
01:06:28,151 --> 01:06:28,901
I'm just saying,

2687
01:06:28,901 --> 01:06:29,734
I'm just saying,

2688
01:06:30,010 --> 01:06:30,400
but I don't,

2689
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:31,710
I don't think it's necessary to,

2690
01:06:31,720 --> 01:06:33,190
my shit doesn't meet out of Shit.

2691
01:06:34,360 --> 01:06:36,410
My Shit doesn't stink and stick.

2692
01:06:36,690 --> 01:06:37,620
Delicious.

2693
01:06:38,410 --> 01:06:39,310
I the worst thing that happened,

2694
01:06:39,311 --> 01:06:39,760
Joe,

2695
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:43,000
one of my toilet paper rolls fell into
my toilet and then I took like the

2696
01:06:43,001 --> 01:06:46,630
biggest shit ever on top of it
and then I stood up and I'm like,

2697
01:06:46,660 --> 01:06:46,991
Oh,

2698
01:06:46,991 --> 01:06:47,810
what now?

2699
01:06:47,810 --> 01:06:50,160
I had it like you'll get it in
their old 12 members in there.

2700
01:06:50,161 --> 01:06:52,450
You didn't know a hole in your ass.

2701
01:06:53,410 --> 01:06:57,640
I just opened up the lid and it's whoever
used it before my have shut the lid

2702
01:06:57,641 --> 01:06:59,050
after it fell in the toilet already.

2703
01:06:59,051 --> 01:07:01,010
I just open up the lid and
sat down with trainspotting.

2704
01:07:01,060 --> 01:07:02,220
You had like dive in there,

2705
01:07:02,580 --> 01:07:03,340
get after that.

2706
01:07:03,340 --> 01:07:05,170
And then I put in an empty net,

2707
01:07:05,860 --> 01:07:07,750
wrap those plastic containers,

2708
01:07:07,751 --> 01:07:08,080
you know,

2709
01:07:08,080 --> 01:07:09,870
like where you put the boat wipes.

2710
01:07:09,890 --> 01:07:11,620
Then we had an empty one,

2711
01:07:11,621 --> 01:07:13,960
but it was too small and I squished it.

2712
01:07:13,961 --> 01:07:14,830
And all this water.

2713
01:07:15,390 --> 01:07:15,780
Listen,

2714
01:07:15,780 --> 01:07:19,110
just Google worse Google Japanese.

2715
01:07:19,550 --> 01:07:21,750
This is from daily tech.

2716
01:07:21,751 --> 01:07:22,680
Dot comes where?

2717
01:07:22,681 --> 01:07:22,881
Ah,

2718
01:07:22,881 --> 01:07:23,190
the,

2719
01:07:23,190 --> 01:07:23,970
the article,

2720
01:07:23,970 --> 01:07:28,710
Google Japanese make delicious new
nourishing steaks from human feces.

2721
01:07:28,711 --> 01:07:29,970
And you'll get this article.

2722
01:07:30,300 --> 01:07:32,220
It is really crazy.

2723
01:07:32,340 --> 01:07:37,340
The Tokyo sewage service in Japan
serves over 13 million people,

2724
01:07:37,770 --> 01:07:39,750
approximately 2000,

2725
01:07:39,751 --> 01:07:41,700
200 square kilometer area.

2726
01:07:42,030 --> 01:07:43,740
And this guy,

2727
01:07:43,770 --> 01:07:44,100
um,

2728
01:07:44,100 --> 01:07:45,650
they approached this Guy Mitch.

2729
01:07:45,651 --> 01:07:47,220
So Yuki Ikea,

2730
01:07:47,350 --> 01:07:50,250
who's a researcher from that guy.

2731
01:07:50,850 --> 01:07:51,151
Okay.

2732
01:07:51,151 --> 01:07:53,730
Yama laboratory and their ideas,

2733
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:54,210
they,

2734
01:07:54,210 --> 01:07:56,730
the problem is they
had too much sewer mud,

2735
01:07:56,970 --> 01:07:59,490
also known as a shouldn't human excrement.

2736
01:07:59,491 --> 01:08:00,210
Okay.

2737
01:08:00,210 --> 01:08:04,800
And so the excrement is a breeding
ground for scores of bacteria.

2738
01:08:05,010 --> 01:08:09,540
So this guy came up with this crazy
idea to make food out of that.

2739
01:08:09,570 --> 01:08:10,470
No Way.

2740
01:08:10,530 --> 01:08:11,130
Yeah.

2741
01:08:11,130 --> 01:08:11,963
I mean,

2742
01:08:12,910 --> 01:08:13,290
I mean,

2743
01:08:13,290 --> 01:08:13,591
you know,

2744
01:08:13,591 --> 01:08:14,430
in a way it's good,

2745
01:08:14,431 --> 01:08:14,690
right?

2746
01:08:14,690 --> 01:08:17,450
Because we're going to have food problem,

2747
01:08:17,480 --> 01:08:17,961
you know?

2748
01:08:17,961 --> 01:08:19,640
And if we could recycle everything,

2749
01:08:19,641 --> 01:08:20,331
if we could recycle,

2750
01:08:20,331 --> 01:08:20,571
you know,

2751
01:08:20,571 --> 01:08:20,781
hey,

2752
01:08:20,781 --> 01:08:21,410
let's do it.

2753
01:08:21,410 --> 01:08:22,243
You know,

2754
01:08:22,270 --> 01:08:23,103
I don't get it.

2755
01:08:23,690 --> 01:08:25,460
The first idea is what the guy does.

2756
01:08:25,461 --> 01:08:28,670
The first step is they cook the
bacteria and it kills the bacteria.

2757
01:08:28,671 --> 01:08:32,150
And then they extract their
proteins via separation technique.

2758
01:08:32,180 --> 01:08:33,013
Right.

2759
01:08:33,050 --> 01:08:36,050
And Soy protein is added
to enhance the flavor.

2760
01:08:36,110 --> 01:08:38,330
That's how you know
that it tastes terrible.

2761
01:08:39,890 --> 01:08:41,340
Let's make your food tastes better.

2762
01:08:41,360 --> 01:08:43,930
It's better because you're
eating shit and Tofa.

2763
01:08:44,650 --> 01:08:45,270
Oh,

2764
01:08:45,270 --> 01:08:46,190
that's a tough one.

2765
01:08:46,820 --> 01:08:47,211
Yeah.

2766
01:08:47,211 --> 01:08:50,450
It's even finished with a red food
color to give it a comforting,

2767
01:08:50,451 --> 01:08:51,110
whew.

2768
01:08:51,110 --> 01:08:51,291
Well,

2769
01:08:51,291 --> 01:08:51,471
you know,

2770
01:08:51,471 --> 01:08:51,890
they die.

2771
01:08:51,890 --> 01:08:54,980
Mcdonald's dies their meat to make
it a blessing to be translucent,

2772
01:08:55,430 --> 01:08:56,210
translucent.

2773
01:08:56,210 --> 01:08:56,331
Well,

2774
01:08:56,331 --> 01:08:57,164
it's so fatty.

2775
01:08:57,740 --> 01:08:58,071
Really?

2776
01:08:58,071 --> 01:08:58,780
Is that what it is?

2777
01:08:58,780 --> 01:09:00,790
They have put up these
hamburger meat diets.

2778
01:09:00,850 --> 01:09:01,080
I mean,

2779
01:09:01,080 --> 01:09:01,500
I don't know.

2780
01:09:01,500 --> 01:09:01,590
It's,

2781
01:09:01,590 --> 01:09:01,840
that's,

2782
01:09:01,840 --> 01:09:02,601
it could be an urban myth.

2783
01:09:02,601 --> 01:09:03,200
I could be wrong.

2784
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:04,033
Could be,

2785
01:09:04,320 --> 01:09:05,090
you've gotta be careful.

2786
01:09:05,090 --> 01:09:05,391
I know.

2787
01:09:05,391 --> 01:09:06,770
It'd be so many Snopes that,

2788
01:09:07,220 --> 01:09:07,520
um,

2789
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:08,353
there's a,

2790
01:09:08,490 --> 01:09:09,440
a website,

2791
01:09:09,441 --> 01:09:10,161
I forgot what the website is,

2792
01:09:10,161 --> 01:09:12,960
where they take a cheeseburger
from Mcdonald's and they
just let it or a handle

2793
01:09:12,961 --> 01:09:13,321
on what happened.

2794
01:09:13,321 --> 01:09:15,560
Let it sit out and it fucking never rots.

2795
01:09:16,010 --> 01:09:16,970
So shelf life is

2796
01:09:18,590 --> 01:09:19,400
like a twinkie.

2797
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:19,581
Yeah.

2798
01:09:19,581 --> 01:09:21,460
Maybe if she'd go to the radio,

2799
01:09:21,461 --> 01:09:24,910
carbon dating and isotopes and like if
you know that twinkie shirts and big

2800
01:09:24,920 --> 01:09:25,200
back,

2801
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:27,530
it's actually the Twinkies
don't last forever.

2802
01:09:27,610 --> 01:09:28,520
And it's just a myth,

2803
01:09:28,521 --> 01:09:28,950
I believe.

2804
01:09:28,950 --> 01:09:29,510
Don't know.

2805
01:09:29,510 --> 01:09:30,290
How long do they last?

2806
01:09:30,290 --> 01:09:34,040
Like I think it's a couple of months
after or a month or something like that.

2807
01:09:34,041 --> 01:09:34,750
After the,

2808
01:09:34,750 --> 01:09:35,110
there's a,

2809
01:09:35,110 --> 01:09:36,100
the sugar goes off.

2810
01:09:36,101 --> 01:09:37,660
Why didn't you try?

2811
01:09:37,780 --> 01:09:40,410
Because you had some of
the last 25 to take one.

2812
01:09:41,260 --> 01:09:45,020
Put It on your desk if
you're under 100 donors.

2813
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:45,761
Yeah.

2814
01:09:45,761 --> 01:09:48,220
Take one and put it on a plate and see if,

2815
01:09:48,221 --> 01:09:48,950
uh,

2816
01:09:48,950 --> 01:09:50,210
and then find that whole thing.

2817
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:51,111
By the way,

2818
01:09:51,111 --> 01:09:54,200
I would have you started buying it if
you guys got into nine and yet what does

2819
01:09:54,201 --> 01:09:54,710
that mean?

2820
01:09:54,710 --> 01:09:56,750
Vine is a program that
Twitter just buy it.

2821
01:09:56,780 --> 01:09:57,950
You remember about a year ago,

2822
01:09:57,980 --> 01:09:59,860
somebody on one of these podcasts ask,

2823
01:09:59,861 --> 01:10:00,890
what do you think's next?

2824
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:01,741
What's the next Twitter?

2825
01:10:01,741 --> 01:10:02,481
And I said video,

2826
01:10:02,481 --> 01:10:02,811
Twitter.

2827
01:10:02,811 --> 01:10:03,644
It's pretty much what it is.

2828
01:10:03,950 --> 01:10:07,300
And so what it is is Twitter just bought
this company called vine and it's like

2829
01:10:07,880 --> 01:10:11,210
seven seconds of video
and you just pretty much,

2830
01:10:11,211 --> 01:10:14,290
you can just do seven seconds or
you could do like stop motion.

2831
01:10:14,360 --> 01:10:14,551
All right,

2832
01:10:14,551 --> 01:10:14,930
so hold on.

2833
01:10:14,930 --> 01:10:15,651
Seven seconds.

2834
01:10:15,651 --> 01:10:16,200
Is this ready?

2835
01:10:16,200 --> 01:10:17,160
Go Dude Dude,

2836
01:10:17,161 --> 01:10:17,371
dude,

2837
01:10:17,371 --> 01:10:17,740
dude,

2838
01:10:17,740 --> 01:10:18,573
dude,

2839
01:10:19,290 --> 01:10:20,123
dude,

2840
01:10:24,120 --> 01:10:24,953
that's not enough.

2841
01:10:25,050 --> 01:10:26,550
That's enough time to do something stupid.

2842
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:27,240
Yeah.

2843
01:10:27,240 --> 01:10:30,720
And but what's cool is that it
loops it but like an animated Gif.

2844
01:10:30,810 --> 01:10:33,180
So everyone's making
pretty much animated gifts,

2845
01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:35,340
but it does it with the sound.

2846
01:10:35,340 --> 01:10:37,950
So how many of them are just girls
asked is about growing up in the horn,

2847
01:10:37,960 --> 01:10:41,680
of course is leading the way in and
six seconds is all you need for more.

2848
01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:43,710
Are you allowed to have porn on Twitter?

2849
01:10:43,711 --> 01:10:44,850
Cause some girls do.

2850
01:10:45,150 --> 01:10:47,580
Like sometimes you go to their profile
and all of sudden it's a cock in her

2851
01:10:47,581 --> 01:10:47,830
mouth.

2852
01:10:47,830 --> 01:10:49,680
It's just because they haven't been found.

2853
01:10:50,790 --> 01:10:51,250
Wow.

2854
01:10:51,250 --> 01:10:52,200
There's a lot of them out there.

2855
01:10:53,350 --> 01:10:54,410
There's pretty lacks.

2856
01:10:54,870 --> 01:10:56,550
Some of the best people though is Brody.

2857
01:10:56,600 --> 01:11:01,180
Brody is fucking hilarious
at the divine for.

2858
01:11:01,470 --> 01:11:05,190
It's just like pretty much got big in
the last couple of weeks and now it's

2859
01:11:05,191 --> 01:11:06,390
blowing the fuck up.

2860
01:11:06,480 --> 01:11:07,313
Or I'll show you some.

2861
01:11:07,350 --> 01:11:08,490
That's fascinating man.

2862
01:11:08,580 --> 01:11:11,160
And what it does is it just
loops the brave new world.

2863
01:11:11,790 --> 01:11:12,151
Well,

2864
01:11:12,151 --> 01:11:12,451
it's,

2865
01:11:12,451 --> 01:11:13,111
that's know.

2866
01:11:13,111 --> 01:11:14,010
I have not seen any,

2867
01:11:14,010 --> 01:11:15,510
I've heard the backed of our strange,

2868
01:11:15,511 --> 01:11:18,410
strange fucking wacky culture where we're,

2869
01:11:18,420 --> 01:11:20,520
we're getting more and
more ink interconnected,

2870
01:11:20,550 --> 01:11:23,040
giving people a little seven
seconds glimpse to your life,

2871
01:11:23,780 --> 01:11:24,120
you know,

2872
01:11:24,120 --> 01:11:25,350
over and over and over again.

2873
01:11:26,310 --> 01:11:27,143
Right.

2874
01:11:28,220 --> 01:11:30,050
It's weird stuff to prepare for.

2875
01:11:30,051 --> 01:11:31,090
It's like they're there.

2876
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:32,180
The real question is,

2877
01:11:32,181 --> 01:11:33,014
what's next?

2878
01:11:33,230 --> 01:11:36,950
And are these instincts and all the,

2879
01:11:36,951 --> 01:11:37,810
these hunting and gas,

2880
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:41,560
are they holding us back or is
it inevitable that things change?

2881
01:11:41,561 --> 01:11:42,580
Is it good that they change?

2882
01:11:42,780 --> 01:11:43,140
Well,

2883
01:11:43,140 --> 01:11:43,411
I mean,

2884
01:11:43,411 --> 01:11:44,430
the question really comes,

2885
01:11:44,431 --> 01:11:44,881
I think,

2886
01:11:44,881 --> 01:11:45,714
you know,

2887
01:11:45,930 --> 01:11:47,530
they're not going to
change unless there's a,

2888
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:47,930
an,

2889
01:11:47,930 --> 01:11:48,300
you know,

2890
01:11:48,300 --> 01:11:49,860
an evolutionary advantage.

2891
01:11:49,861 --> 01:11:51,270
Unless they're selected out.

2892
01:11:51,300 --> 01:11:51,481
Like,

2893
01:11:51,481 --> 01:11:51,780
yeah,

2894
01:11:51,780 --> 01:11:52,280
people are always like,

2895
01:11:52,280 --> 01:11:52,870
oh,

2896
01:11:52,870 --> 01:11:54,540
your pinky toe is gonna disappear.

2897
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:54,901
No,

2898
01:11:54,901 --> 01:11:55,500
it's not.

2899
01:11:55,500 --> 01:11:56,340
Not unless it's like,

2900
01:11:56,341 --> 01:11:59,160
unless guys without the pinky toe are
really like really good looking and have a

2901
01:11:59,161 --> 01:11:59,731
lot of kids.

2902
01:11:59,731 --> 01:12:00,091
You know what I mean?

2903
01:12:00,091 --> 01:12:03,930
There's got to be right and
evolutionary pressure for that change.

2904
01:12:03,931 --> 01:12:06,510
So I kind of feel like we've removed
all the evolutionary pressures because

2905
01:12:06,511 --> 01:12:08,790
we've created the perfect
environment for ourselves.

2906
01:12:09,220 --> 01:12:09,860
You know,

2907
01:12:09,860 --> 01:12:11,670
and there's a lot of guys
that are smarter than me.

2908
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:12,360
They talk about,

2909
01:12:12,360 --> 01:12:15,150
there still are subtle pressures of work.

2910
01:12:15,420 --> 01:12:16,253
It's just,

2911
01:12:16,500 --> 01:12:17,490
I don't know what they are.

2912
01:12:17,560 --> 01:12:20,770
It's just not the same sort of pressures
that exist in the natural world.

2913
01:12:20,771 --> 01:12:22,990
We spent at all created
these contained environments.

2914
01:12:22,991 --> 01:12:25,600
These cities were perfectly
suited for this environment.

2915
01:12:25,601 --> 01:12:26,870
It's very strange and it's,

2916
01:12:26,890 --> 01:12:27,000
uh,

2917
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:31,060
it's so confusing because as science
advances and he gets to the point where

2918
01:12:31,061 --> 01:12:35,080
they have nanotechnology to keep your
body alive and eat all the cancers in you

2919
01:12:35,081 --> 01:12:37,510
and you're going to be able
to genetically engineer you.

2920
01:12:37,511 --> 01:12:40,960
So you look like a super athlete and
they're going to be able to change your

2921
01:12:40,961 --> 01:12:44,890
mind and make you symbiotically
connected to electronics.

2922
01:12:45,110 --> 01:12:46,280
Put Google in your brain.

2923
01:12:47,050 --> 01:12:49,720
I mean Google glasses is just right now.

2924
01:12:49,721 --> 01:12:49,991
It's,

2925
01:12:49,991 --> 01:12:52,360
you wear it well how long
before it's an insert,

2926
01:12:52,361 --> 01:12:52,940
plug it in.

2927
01:12:52,940 --> 01:12:54,730
I mean when is it going
to be a contact lens?

2928
01:12:54,731 --> 01:12:57,790
Cause they're also considering
that they're considering
contact lenses that show

2929
01:12:57,791 --> 01:12:59,230
you information on the Lens,

2930
01:12:59,500 --> 01:13:00,080
right?

2931
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:02,320
Like some sort of a
Bluetooth or something.

2932
01:13:02,321 --> 01:13:03,131
Contact Lens.

2933
01:13:03,131 --> 01:13:06,610
Will they be able to
communicate wirelessly and
you'll see fucking images on

2934
01:13:06,611 --> 01:13:09,010
your eyes when you know how long,

2935
01:13:09,370 --> 01:13:10,330
but when,

2936
01:13:10,390 --> 01:13:11,223
when does that,

2937
01:13:11,410 --> 01:13:12,940
when is that going to be a reality?

2938
01:13:12,970 --> 01:13:15,460
When I was assistant to a
story on NPR about robotics,

2939
01:13:15,461 --> 01:13:16,211
like taking over,

2940
01:13:16,211 --> 01:13:16,541
you know,

2941
01:13:16,541 --> 01:13:16,871
Blah Blah,

2942
01:13:16,871 --> 01:13:17,051
blah,

2943
01:13:17,051 --> 01:13:18,010
that old story about,

2944
01:13:18,011 --> 01:13:18,844
you know,

2945
01:13:18,970 --> 01:13:19,360
and you,

2946
01:13:19,360 --> 01:13:22,180
and you wonder if there are certain point
where it's just cheaper to get people

2947
01:13:22,181 --> 01:13:24,160
to do it because people were cheaper.

2948
01:13:24,161 --> 01:13:24,911
You know what I mean?

2949
01:13:24,911 --> 01:13:27,190
Like isn't it at some
point but exponential.

2950
01:13:27,191 --> 01:13:27,461
Yeah.

2951
01:13:27,461 --> 01:13:28,151
Well that's true,

2952
01:13:28,151 --> 01:13:28,421
right?

2953
01:13:28,421 --> 01:13:33,421
Especially in the real issue with
certain countries don't value human life.

2954
01:13:35,230 --> 01:13:38,320
There's this countries where and then
it's always the countries that have the

2955
01:13:38,321 --> 01:13:38,891
most people.

2956
01:13:38,891 --> 01:13:39,430
Right?

2957
01:13:39,430 --> 01:13:41,530
So it's like what you hear
about human rights violations.

2958
01:13:41,531 --> 01:13:45,280
Like China's like a real tricky one when
it comes to like factory workers and

2959
01:13:45,710 --> 01:13:46,900
she's just so God damn anything.

2960
01:13:47,460 --> 01:13:48,430
What are you going to sort of,

2961
01:13:48,700 --> 01:13:49,533
what are you showing me?

2962
01:13:49,720 --> 01:13:50,350
The vine.

2963
01:13:50,350 --> 01:13:51,190
That's what it is.

2964
01:13:51,590 --> 01:13:56,590
It's just like a quick animation thing
and it just has like sometimes it has

2965
01:13:56,981 --> 01:13:57,461
sound,

2966
01:13:57,461 --> 01:13:58,420
sometimes it doesn't,

2967
01:13:59,660 --> 01:14:01,330
but it's caught on to the point.

2968
01:14:01,360 --> 01:14:03,310
Everybody is fucking doing it right now.

2969
01:14:03,340 --> 01:14:04,001
WHO's everybody?

2970
01:14:04,001 --> 01:14:05,440
I'm not like you're not doing it.

2971
01:14:05,470 --> 01:14:06,220
Look at Twitter.

2972
01:14:06,220 --> 01:14:07,053
Have you done it?

2973
01:14:07,730 --> 01:14:07,990
Yeah,

2974
01:14:07,990 --> 01:14:08,091
I'm,

2975
01:14:08,091 --> 01:14:08,711
I'm all over.

2976
01:14:08,711 --> 01:14:09,580
When did you start doing it?

2977
01:14:09,850 --> 01:14:11,060
About four days ago.

2978
01:14:11,200 --> 01:14:12,010
How can people find you

2979
01:14:12,010 --> 01:14:12,340
on it?

2980
01:14:12,340 --> 01:14:16,300
You just started doing it and you're just
making little videos like just for fun

2981
01:14:16,301 --> 01:14:20,410
or like ever since it came out I'm
already not even using Instagram anymore.

2982
01:14:20,411 --> 01:14:21,130
It's good.

2983
01:14:21,130 --> 01:14:24,370
You jump on it right now and people
are getting really good at it.

2984
01:14:24,371 --> 01:14:24,941
Like a will.

2985
01:14:24,941 --> 01:14:26,980
Sasso is really funny.

2986
01:14:27,010 --> 01:14:30,640
Add it and you could become
the next Twitter champ.

2987
01:14:30,660 --> 01:14:32,200
A chess master.

2988
01:14:32,220 --> 01:14:33,160
He started right now.

2989
01:14:34,490 --> 01:14:35,323
I wonder where it ends.

2990
01:14:35,370 --> 01:14:36,490
I just started tweeting,

2991
01:14:37,280 --> 01:14:39,140
finally fucking got ahold of it somehow.

2992
01:14:39,610 --> 01:14:41,100
How come you can't Kid Sam Sheridan?

2993
01:14:41,640 --> 01:14:41,891
What's the,

2994
01:14:41,891 --> 01:14:42,311
I dunno,

2995
01:14:42,311 --> 01:14:43,600
I just don't have that fighters.

2996
01:14:43,630 --> 01:14:44,171
I probably could.

2997
01:14:44,171 --> 01:14:45,004
I don't know

2998
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:46,833
who Sam Sherman.

2999
01:14:46,870 --> 01:14:48,040
Because you've got a new book out man.

3000
01:14:48,041 --> 01:14:48,300
Call.

3001
01:14:48,300 --> 01:14:49,150
Call it a fighter's mind.

3002
01:14:49,151 --> 01:14:50,520
Your new book is disaster diary.

3003
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:52,270
Just as confusing as fuck man.

3004
01:14:52,810 --> 01:14:53,321
At one point.

3005
01:14:53,321 --> 01:14:54,110
But I am doing it.

3006
01:14:54,110 --> 01:14:54,400
I am.

3007
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:54,670
I am.

3008
01:14:54,670 --> 01:14:55,010
I,

3009
01:14:55,010 --> 01:14:57,160
it's funny that I was talking to a
guy who works there and he's like,

3010
01:14:57,161 --> 01:14:57,311
yeah,

3011
01:14:57,311 --> 01:14:58,960
it just clicks for people at some point.

3012
01:14:59,230 --> 01:14:59,630
Twitter.

3013
01:14:59,630 --> 01:15:01,510
And then it finally clicked
for me a little bit.

3014
01:15:01,770 --> 01:15:01,930
Oh,

3015
01:15:01,930 --> 01:15:02,651
Twitter is amazing.

3016
01:15:02,651 --> 01:15:06,270
You know what's the most amazing thing
for me is retweeting things again,

3017
01:15:06,370 --> 01:15:08,740
cool shit that people send
me and then retweeted them.

3018
01:15:08,741 --> 01:15:09,460
Yeah.

3019
01:15:09,460 --> 01:15:10,270
It's um,

3020
01:15:10,270 --> 01:15:11,270
between um,

3021
01:15:11,350 --> 01:15:12,370
Matt stags,

3022
01:15:12,460 --> 01:15:13,690
my publicist,

3023
01:15:13,720 --> 01:15:15,850
he sends me three times a day,

3024
01:15:15,851 --> 01:15:20,380
the nuttiest shit that he finds on
the Internet as part of like his gig.

3025
01:15:20,830 --> 01:15:21,251
And,

3026
01:15:21,251 --> 01:15:21,940
um,

3027
01:15:21,940 --> 01:15:25,000
between that and the shit that
I get from dudes on Twitter,

3028
01:15:25,330 --> 01:15:29,170
it's amazing the access to new
ideas and stories you have,

3029
01:15:29,350 --> 01:15:30,040
the Av,

3030
01:15:30,040 --> 01:15:35,040
that change is one of the biggest changes
in human culture over the last hundred

3031
01:15:36,220 --> 01:15:37,053
years.

3032
01:15:37,330 --> 01:15:38,163
What are you doing Bryan?

3033
01:15:38,170 --> 01:15:38,720
I'm finding it,

3034
01:15:38,720 --> 01:15:41,110
finding that do a dance,

3035
01:15:41,170 --> 01:15:45,360
do a dance change is one of
the biggest changes in a,

3036
01:15:45,361 --> 01:15:46,250
in human culture.

3037
01:15:46,251 --> 01:15:47,084
I think it's,

3038
01:15:47,100 --> 01:15:47,280
well,

3039
01:15:47,280 --> 01:15:49,510
she had the ubiquity of information,

3040
01:15:49,511 --> 01:15:49,661
you know,

3041
01:15:49,661 --> 01:15:51,040
you can get stuff,

3042
01:15:51,070 --> 01:15:51,401
you know,

3043
01:15:51,401 --> 01:15:52,160
you can know everything.

3044
01:15:52,160 --> 01:15:52,993
You can be in India,

3045
01:15:53,020 --> 01:15:53,853
in India,

3046
01:15:53,920 --> 01:15:57,520
and get all the information that
we can get right here and all that.

3047
01:15:57,550 --> 01:15:58,383
Yeah.

3048
01:15:58,630 --> 01:16:02,580
As long as there's some sort of a
connection to your phone or some sort of,

3049
01:16:02,980 --> 01:16:04,660
even a fucking two g,

3050
01:16:05,110 --> 01:16:05,411
you know,

3051
01:16:05,411 --> 01:16:06,730
if you're in some shitty country,

3052
01:16:06,940 --> 01:16:08,560
just take a little slower,

3053
01:16:08,740 --> 01:16:10,990
but you're still gonna be able
to connect to the database.

3054
01:16:11,230 --> 01:16:11,411
And now,

3055
01:16:11,411 --> 01:16:14,050
especially with Google
answers for questions,

3056
01:16:14,051 --> 01:16:15,760
just at your service.

3057
01:16:15,850 --> 01:16:16,480
Yeah.

3058
01:16:16,480 --> 01:16:16,991
Right there.

3059
01:16:16,991 --> 01:16:18,820
It's fucking drag out tracking.

3060
01:16:18,821 --> 01:16:19,700
You watch it everything.

3061
01:16:20,020 --> 01:16:21,350
But who's tracking who are,

3062
01:16:21,700 --> 01:16:22,630
what are they going to do and how can,

3063
01:16:22,790 --> 01:16:22,991
yeah.

3064
01:16:22,991 --> 01:16:24,580
That's what I feel like tracking them too.

3065
01:16:24,610 --> 01:16:25,630
There's so much information.

3066
01:16:25,631 --> 01:16:27,240
Like you feel free to track my,

3067
01:16:27,540 --> 01:16:31,120
well I think it's really interesting
that people are really concerned with

3068
01:16:31,121 --> 01:16:34,510
privacy as they should be and they're
really concerned with the government

3069
01:16:34,990 --> 01:16:37,960
interfering with their
privacy as they should be.

3070
01:16:38,200 --> 01:16:40,390
But the fucking head
of the CIA got Boston.

3071
01:16:40,660 --> 01:16:41,020
Right.

3072
01:16:41,020 --> 01:16:42,490
That's what's fascinating to me.

3073
01:16:42,491 --> 01:16:43,090
It's like,

3074
01:16:43,090 --> 01:16:43,511
by the way,

3075
01:16:43,511 --> 01:16:45,670
you're not in all your
emails are all online.

3076
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:47,233
Yeah.

3077
01:16:48,420 --> 01:16:49,360
[inaudible]

3078
01:16:49,780 --> 01:16:51,910
who is the head of the spooks.

3079
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:52,810
Okay.

3080
01:16:52,810 --> 01:16:57,040
The FBI goes and investigates him and
it's all there if you can't get away.

3081
01:16:57,370 --> 01:16:58,510
And not only that,

3082
01:16:58,511 --> 01:17:01,020
but like what a bunch of fucking condoms.

3083
01:17:01,210 --> 01:17:03,910
They weren't willing to like look away.

3084
01:17:03,970 --> 01:17:06,070
Like they wanted to bring
that out in the open.

3085
01:17:06,560 --> 01:17:08,320
The eye doesn't like the CIA.

3086
01:17:08,670 --> 01:17:10,130
Like isn't that crazy?

3087
01:17:10,131 --> 01:17:14,060
You would think that
everyone is in the same team.

3088
01:17:14,120 --> 01:17:15,140
You know the FBI,

3089
01:17:15,141 --> 01:17:16,730
the CIA during the same team.

3090
01:17:16,760 --> 01:17:17,620
I feel like they're not.

3091
01:17:17,790 --> 01:17:21,950
There's some probably so much gets
fucked up I pissing contest and you never

3092
01:17:21,951 --> 01:17:25,210
even know about like
major diplomacy like this,

3093
01:17:25,220 --> 01:17:27,890
you know like the head of
this and that and like,

3094
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:29,900
oh I got the wrong
chair funk this meeting.

3095
01:17:29,901 --> 01:17:30,531
You know what I mean?

3096
01:17:30,531 --> 01:17:32,900
And like they walk in and like
we don't know why we're at war.

3097
01:17:33,200 --> 01:17:35,090
That's cause that guy got the wrong chair.

3098
01:17:35,750 --> 01:17:36,101
Hey you,

3099
01:17:36,101 --> 01:17:37,730
why am I on the corner of the table?

3100
01:17:37,731 --> 01:17:38,600
Don't respect me.

3101
01:17:38,601 --> 01:17:39,110
Yeah.

3102
01:17:39,110 --> 01:17:42,440
I shouldn't be at the head of the
table and my chat should be gold dot.

3103
01:17:43,040 --> 01:17:43,460
Yeah,

3104
01:17:43,460 --> 01:17:43,971
there's a,

3105
01:17:43,971 --> 01:17:47,600
you don't even know the pissing contest
is that fact that the FBI doesn't get

3106
01:17:47,601 --> 01:17:48,680
along with the CIA.

3107
01:17:48,681 --> 01:17:49,071
I'm like,

3108
01:17:49,071 --> 01:17:49,940
you motherfucker.

3109
01:17:49,941 --> 01:17:54,500
How do you expect me to be patriotic when
you contour running the whole military

3110
01:17:54,501 --> 01:17:59,240
industrial complex are going
after each other and over pussy.

3111
01:17:59,420 --> 01:17:59,811
Okay.

3112
01:17:59,811 --> 01:18:01,910
It's not worth Patraeus Pussy.

3113
01:18:02,430 --> 01:18:03,320
Well it's not though.

3114
01:18:03,321 --> 01:18:04,131
That was a thing though.

3115
01:18:04,131 --> 01:18:05,480
It was also about Libya.

3116
01:18:05,720 --> 01:18:06,920
It was about Bengazi.

3117
01:18:06,921 --> 01:18:10,670
It was also about them attacking
like the way it was handled.

3118
01:18:10,671 --> 01:18:10,911
The,

3119
01:18:10,911 --> 01:18:13,040
the tacking of the U s embassy apparently.

3120
01:18:13,041 --> 01:18:18,041
And that was part of the whole scandal
that went down was they felt like they

3121
01:18:18,710 --> 01:18:23,510
did a poor job of handling that whole
attack on the US embassy and somehow or

3122
01:18:23,511 --> 01:18:24,650
another it's connected.

3123
01:18:24,680 --> 01:18:26,090
I don't know how we,

3124
01:18:26,270 --> 01:18:29,400
civilians will probably
never know exactly what,

3125
01:18:29,410 --> 01:18:30,340
probably more professor who,

3126
01:18:30,341 --> 01:18:30,631
you know,

3127
01:18:30,631 --> 01:18:33,830
it's just pedestrian
and boring people just,

3128
01:18:33,831 --> 01:18:35,900
I don't know why it's all about puts it,

3129
01:18:35,901 --> 01:18:39,650
but it's all about the fact
that there's no privacy anymore,

3130
01:18:40,010 --> 01:18:40,770
you know?

3131
01:18:40,770 --> 01:18:41,000
Yeah.

3132
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,590
And everything is recorded and I'm going,

3133
01:18:43,810 --> 01:18:46,490
of course you've seen all the
videos of the media right across,

3134
01:18:46,920 --> 01:18:47,701
say wild,

3135
01:18:47,701 --> 01:18:48,110
right.

3136
01:18:48,110 --> 01:18:51,350
You know what I found out the Russians
have a lot of dash cams because of

3137
01:18:51,351 --> 01:18:54,800
insurance fraud because the Russian people
just fucking slam on the brakes or in

3138
01:18:54,801 --> 01:18:55,150
front of it.

3139
01:18:55,150 --> 01:18:55,983
You hit to me

3140
01:18:57,650 --> 01:18:58,550
named sue you.

3141
01:18:58,760 --> 01:18:59,270
Um,

3142
01:18:59,270 --> 01:19:00,560
apparently it's super dominant.

3143
01:19:00,620 --> 01:19:01,760
Russian Russians drive.

3144
01:19:01,761 --> 01:19:02,594
So bananas.

3145
01:19:02,650 --> 01:19:04,910
And you ever seen some of
the Russian dragon videos?

3146
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:08,290
I think I tweeted about it or
talking about it or something.

3147
01:19:08,360 --> 01:19:10,490
W rushing driving videos
are fucking horrible.

3148
01:19:10,491 --> 01:19:11,180
They're amazing.

3149
01:19:11,180 --> 01:19:12,590
They are animals.

3150
01:19:12,770 --> 01:19:15,770
There's two types of really
loony driving videos out there.

3151
01:19:15,771 --> 01:19:16,640
I don't want to generalize,

3152
01:19:16,641 --> 01:19:18,320
but I'm Gunna two types.

3153
01:19:18,321 --> 01:19:19,131
The Chinese,

3154
01:19:19,131 --> 01:19:20,510
which we've had on the show before,

3155
01:19:20,511 --> 01:19:21,344
and Russians,

3156
01:19:21,380 --> 01:19:24,080
Chinese for being fucking
completely clueless.

3157
01:19:24,350 --> 01:19:26,000
Like someone told me,

3158
01:19:26,030 --> 01:19:27,740
and I don't know if it's
just showing it retro,

3159
01:19:27,741 --> 01:19:29,150
but it's not racial,

3160
01:19:29,151 --> 01:19:29,481
it's,

3161
01:19:29,481 --> 01:19:30,290
it's,

3162
01:19:30,290 --> 01:19:31,880
it's more racial than racist,

3163
01:19:32,210 --> 01:19:34,520
but what it is is that the culture,

3164
01:19:34,550 --> 01:19:35,420
the Chinese culture,

3165
01:19:35,421 --> 01:19:38,720
because there are so many people
interacting with each other that they're

3166
01:19:38,721 --> 01:19:40,490
comfortable bumping into each other.

3167
01:19:41,270 --> 01:19:44,540
It's a part of the normal
culture population's so big
and you just get used to

3168
01:19:44,541 --> 01:19:44,810
it.

3169
01:19:44,810 --> 01:19:45,950
And if you're in Asia,

3170
01:19:45,980 --> 01:19:48,260
like you have to accept that
like this is the way they are.

3171
01:19:48,261 --> 01:19:49,190
They're not being rude.

3172
01:19:49,191 --> 01:19:49,971
It's just pumping into,

3173
01:19:49,971 --> 01:19:50,751
it was kind of like that.

3174
01:19:50,751 --> 01:19:51,171
You've been there,

3175
01:19:51,171 --> 01:19:51,711
you know what I mean?

3176
01:19:51,711 --> 01:19:52,100
Yeah.

3177
01:19:52,100 --> 01:19:53,360
I didn't find that in Tokyo.

3178
01:19:53,361 --> 01:19:54,470
I found them to be very polite,

3179
01:19:54,471 --> 01:19:55,400
but apparently China,

3180
01:19:56,190 --> 01:19:56,660
you're,

3181
01:19:56,660 --> 01:19:57,230
you're right,

3182
01:19:57,230 --> 01:19:57,681
it's thick,

3183
01:19:57,681 --> 01:19:58,830
high density population.

3184
01:19:59,270 --> 01:20:00,103
People are touching you.

3185
01:20:00,110 --> 01:20:05,110
But the idea is that they're used to
looking straight ahead and not looking to

3186
01:20:06,181 --> 01:20:08,430
the left and looking to the
right and their culture also

3187
01:20:08,700 --> 01:20:13,110
rewards or sort of encourages mining your
own fucking business and keeping your

3188
01:20:13,111 --> 01:20:13,770
eyes on yourself,

3189
01:20:13,770 --> 01:20:17,490
not paying attention and not wandering
around and undisciplined gates.

3190
01:20:17,670 --> 01:20:19,020
Well that sort of applies.

3191
01:20:19,021 --> 01:20:19,771
They're driving,

3192
01:20:19,771 --> 01:20:23,320
they have blinders on and they just sort
of go where they were trying to go and

3193
01:20:23,330 --> 01:20:24,210
mention this.

3194
01:20:24,480 --> 01:20:27,780
This sort of way of looking at the world
does not work when you're dealing with

3195
01:20:27,781 --> 01:20:28,614
cars.

3196
01:20:28,830 --> 01:20:31,510
When you're sober you
have to avoid traffic and

3197
01:20:31,650 --> 01:20:32,820
brings it right back to my book,

3198
01:20:32,821 --> 01:20:35,970
which is really Nice because situational
awareness was one of the things I

3199
01:20:35,971 --> 01:20:36,661
really got into.

3200
01:20:36,661 --> 01:20:39,090
And situational awareness is exactly that.

3201
01:20:39,091 --> 01:20:43,170
Like paying attention to your surroundings
and it's a huge survival trait.

3202
01:20:43,171 --> 01:20:43,411
You know,

3203
01:20:43,411 --> 01:20:45,480
it's like the military train it,

3204
01:20:45,481 --> 01:20:46,830
they talk about essay all the time,

3205
01:20:46,831 --> 01:20:48,990
training your essay and they do things.

3206
01:20:49,470 --> 01:20:50,041
But you know,

3207
01:20:50,041 --> 01:20:52,290
it's that natural thing like
you do in a parking lot,

3208
01:20:52,291 --> 01:20:52,550
right?

3209
01:20:52,550 --> 01:20:53,280
Cause you're,

3210
01:20:53,280 --> 01:20:53,491
you know,

3211
01:20:53,491 --> 01:20:54,241
you're not in the freeway,

3212
01:20:54,241 --> 01:20:55,110
you're kind of space out,

3213
01:20:55,111 --> 01:20:55,621
listen to music.

3214
01:20:55,621 --> 01:20:56,251
But in a parking lot,

3215
01:20:56,251 --> 01:20:56,460
you're,

3216
01:20:56,460 --> 01:21:00,130
you know what's going on and you're
creeping around and your situation and

3217
01:21:00,131 --> 01:21:00,451
where,

3218
01:21:00,451 --> 01:21:00,631
you know,

3219
01:21:00,631 --> 01:21:01,464
that's kind of the difference.

3220
01:21:01,560 --> 01:21:06,560
And your book also covered how important
one little mistake can be in a critical

3221
01:21:07,771 --> 01:21:08,281
situation.

3222
01:21:08,281 --> 01:21:09,480
Like especially in a fire,

3223
01:21:09,481 --> 01:21:10,171
you were talking about,

3224
01:21:10,171 --> 01:21:14,970
you spent a lot of time fighting forest
fires and how you go left when you

3225
01:21:14,971 --> 01:21:15,481
should've gone.

3226
01:21:15,481 --> 01:21:16,620
Right and you're fucked.

3227
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:17,713
You're trapped.

3228
01:21:17,840 --> 01:21:18,260
And,

3229
01:21:18,260 --> 01:21:18,680
and,

3230
01:21:18,680 --> 01:21:21,600
and the only way to find
out is to make that mistake.

3231
01:21:22,160 --> 01:21:22,341
Yeah.

3232
01:21:22,341 --> 01:21:23,121
What did he say?

3233
01:21:23,121 --> 01:21:23,331
Like,

3234
01:21:23,331 --> 01:21:23,481
you know,

3235
01:21:23,481 --> 01:21:25,370
fire like a lot of things,

3236
01:21:25,371 --> 01:21:28,340
but fire supplies the test
first and then less than second.

3237
01:21:28,400 --> 01:21:28,701
Right.

3238
01:21:28,701 --> 01:21:28,881
You know,

3239
01:21:28,881 --> 01:21:29,790
which is so you,

3240
01:21:29,791 --> 01:21:30,110
you,

3241
01:21:30,110 --> 01:21:33,770
you get tested and then afterwards they
go back and they break down all the

3242
01:21:33,771 --> 01:21:35,450
things you did wrong or did right.

3243
01:21:35,990 --> 01:21:36,351
And you,

3244
01:21:36,351 --> 01:21:37,790
everybody else can learn the lesson,

3245
01:21:37,791 --> 01:21:40,810
but at the time you just get
tested and it's pass fail.

3246
01:21:40,811 --> 01:21:41,660
Like you live or die.

3247
01:21:41,661 --> 01:21:42,494
And it's just,

3248
01:21:42,860 --> 01:21:47,060
and that's kind of the way
fire wildland fire has been.

3249
01:21:47,061 --> 01:21:47,271
And,

3250
01:21:47,271 --> 01:21:47,560
and,

3251
01:21:47,560 --> 01:21:47,870
uh,

3252
01:21:47,870 --> 01:21:52,580
we go back and we studied tragedy fires
where people died like a 30 mile or a

3253
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:53,301
storm King.

3254
01:21:53,301 --> 01:21:54,440
And there's a lot of those names,

3255
01:21:54,441 --> 01:21:59,150
but you sort of break it
down scientifically what
they did wrong when it's

3256
01:21:59,151 --> 01:21:59,570
barely,

3257
01:21:59,570 --> 01:21:59,931
you know,

3258
01:21:59,931 --> 01:22:00,711
hindsight's 20,

3259
01:22:00,711 --> 01:22:01,011
20,

3260
01:22:01,011 --> 01:22:01,701
it totally easy.

3261
01:22:01,701 --> 01:22:02,600
But at the time,

3262
01:22:03,740 --> 01:22:04,130
you know,

3263
01:22:04,130 --> 01:22:05,040
I don't feel like these,

3264
01:22:05,090 --> 01:22:06,980
I really want to hear about how those,

3265
01:22:07,060 --> 01:22:08,800
the cops looking for Dorney a,

3266
01:22:08,860 --> 01:22:09,500
uh,

3267
01:22:09,500 --> 01:22:10,880
shot up the hood of the cars.

3268
01:22:10,910 --> 01:22:11,361
You know what I mean?

3269
01:22:11,361 --> 01:22:12,410
I really want to kind of,

3270
01:22:13,460 --> 01:22:14,180
you know,

3271
01:22:14,180 --> 01:22:16,210
that's the kind of thing I'm
interested in explaining that story,

3272
01:22:16,220 --> 01:22:16,911
but people don't know.

3273
01:22:16,911 --> 01:22:20,320
So there was this been this
huge manhunt in La and um,

3274
01:22:20,410 --> 01:22:21,980
it's Dorner is it Charles Dorner?

3275
01:22:22,940 --> 01:22:23,773
Ll Cool J.

3276
01:22:24,020 --> 01:22:24,141
Yeah,

3277
01:22:24,141 --> 01:22:26,180
he looks a lot like ll
cool j a fat ll cool.

3278
01:22:26,181 --> 01:22:31,181
J and J is huge by the
[inaudible] 70 and not fat,

3279
01:22:31,341 --> 01:22:32,390
like pretty bulky,

3280
01:22:32,391 --> 01:22:33,750
strong after looking dude.

3281
01:22:34,220 --> 01:22:35,050
And uh,

3282
01:22:35,050 --> 01:22:35,360
it was,

3283
01:22:35,360 --> 01:22:35,661
you know,

3284
01:22:35,661 --> 01:22:36,230
he was like,

3285
01:22:36,230 --> 01:22:36,411
you know,

3286
01:22:36,411 --> 01:22:38,450
ex ex military and very dangerous.

3287
01:22:38,451 --> 01:22:43,370
And he wrote this rant on Facebook and
killed some cops and they finally tracked

3288
01:22:43,371 --> 01:22:43,731
him down.

3289
01:22:43,731 --> 01:22:43,950
But yeah,

3290
01:22:43,950 --> 01:22:44,501
kill the cops.

3291
01:22:44,501 --> 01:22:45,041
Family too.

3292
01:22:45,041 --> 01:22:46,930
Is Dot her daughter and her husband,

3293
01:22:47,170 --> 01:22:47,650
he really,

3294
01:22:47,650 --> 01:22:47,841
yeah,

3295
01:22:47,841 --> 01:22:50,140
he killed a cop's
daughter and her husband,

3296
01:22:50,500 --> 01:22:50,920
um,

3297
01:22:50,920 --> 01:22:54,210
you know that the guy who was
representing him at the trial the same,

3298
01:22:54,450 --> 01:22:54,760
right?

3299
01:22:54,760 --> 01:22:54,911
Yeah,

3300
01:22:54,911 --> 01:22:55,241
he was,

3301
01:22:55,241 --> 01:22:56,080
he was very,

3302
01:22:56,081 --> 01:22:56,710
uh,

3303
01:22:56,710 --> 01:22:57,480
bitter about it.

3304
01:22:57,480 --> 01:22:58,480
Know about this by the way.

3305
01:22:58,590 --> 01:22:58,760
Oh,

3306
01:22:58,760 --> 01:22:59,920
a lot of people don't know the story,

3307
01:22:59,921 --> 01:23:00,520
man.

3308
01:23:00,520 --> 01:23:01,470
A lot of people don't know who,

3309
01:23:01,480 --> 01:23:02,470
what the name was.

3310
01:23:02,530 --> 01:23:02,981
Trusted him.

3311
01:23:02,981 --> 01:23:03,670
Everyone's like,

3312
01:23:03,670 --> 01:23:03,841
oh,

3313
01:23:03,841 --> 01:23:04,280
Jay,

3314
01:23:04,280 --> 01:23:05,200
not necessarily.

3315
01:23:05,230 --> 01:23:06,070
It may mean there's a

3316
01:23:06,070 --> 01:23:08,290
lot of people are sort
of vaguely aware of it,

3317
01:23:08,460 --> 01:23:08,910
but,

3318
01:23:08,910 --> 01:23:13,390
but the La people don't know
about the cop shooting up the car.

3319
01:23:13,420 --> 01:23:14,253
They shot up this,

3320
01:23:14,320 --> 01:23:15,131
they show up two cars,

3321
01:23:15,131 --> 01:23:17,500
they shut up two different colored,

3322
01:23:17,530 --> 01:23:17,741
you know,

3323
01:23:17,741 --> 01:23:17,981
again,

3324
01:23:17,981 --> 01:23:18,791
it was dawn.

3325
01:23:18,791 --> 01:23:19,481
So color,

3326
01:23:19,481 --> 01:23:19,661
you know,

3327
01:23:19,661 --> 01:23:20,690
everything's monochromatic.

3328
01:23:20,691 --> 01:23:21,050
It don't,

3329
01:23:21,050 --> 01:23:21,940
it's hard to see color.

3330
01:23:21,941 --> 01:23:23,110
So I don't blame him for that.

3331
01:23:23,111 --> 01:23:27,670
But they shot up a car with
two Mexican old ladies in it.

3332
01:23:27,671 --> 01:23:28,331
So they will do it,

3333
01:23:28,331 --> 01:23:29,290
deliver newspapers,

3334
01:23:29,291 --> 01:23:30,640
newspapers at 4:00 AM.

3335
01:23:30,790 --> 01:23:31,623
And they shot them,

3336
01:23:31,960 --> 01:23:32,793
they shot them,

3337
01:23:32,830 --> 01:23:34,270
and then they shut up at surfer.

3338
01:23:34,271 --> 01:23:38,230
I've got white guy in his
truck and nobody died.

3339
01:23:38,310 --> 01:23:39,820
They don't think they hit the other guy.

3340
01:23:39,850 --> 01:23:40,661
They shot on his truck up.

3341
01:23:40,661 --> 01:23:43,360
But so you wonder how
trigger happy they are.

3342
01:23:43,361 --> 01:23:45,550
And of course LAPD has
terrible reputation.

3343
01:23:45,850 --> 01:23:46,400
Yeah.

3344
01:23:46,400 --> 01:23:47,233
Um,

3345
01:23:47,380 --> 01:23:48,820
but also you sort of see,

3346
01:23:48,821 --> 01:23:49,060
you know,

3347
01:23:49,060 --> 01:23:50,140
it's like very,

3348
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:51,633
it's there.

3349
01:23:51,670 --> 01:23:53,050
People are still people,

3350
01:23:53,051 --> 01:23:56,560
they're still human and you
see what stress does to people,

3351
01:23:56,561 --> 01:23:56,831
you know,

3352
01:23:56,831 --> 01:23:58,980
and you see shit that's not there and you,

3353
01:23:58,981 --> 01:23:59,814
you know,

3354
01:24:00,350 --> 01:24:00,640
it's,

3355
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:01,840
it's this sort of amazing,

3356
01:24:01,841 --> 01:24:04,840
I'd love to kind of see the after
action reports they come up with,

3357
01:24:04,841 --> 01:24:05,674
you know,

3358
01:24:06,230 --> 01:24:08,050
ask the people to get out of the car,

3359
01:24:08,060 --> 01:24:11,000
put their hands up or so I
think they started moving.

3360
01:24:11,220 --> 01:24:11,380
Yeah.

3361
01:24:11,380 --> 01:24:12,161
I think one of the cars,

3362
01:24:12,161 --> 01:24:13,270
they even just rammed it.

3363
01:24:13,280 --> 01:24:14,180
So they just started shooting.

3364
01:24:14,230 --> 01:24:15,430
That's the mother fucker.

3365
01:24:15,580 --> 01:24:15,911
Yup.

3366
01:24:15,911 --> 01:24:16,360
That's him.

3367
01:24:16,360 --> 01:24:16,811
Boom.

3368
01:24:16,811 --> 01:24:17,231
And like,

3369
01:24:17,231 --> 01:24:17,441
you know,

3370
01:24:17,441 --> 01:24:17,681
it's,

3371
01:24:17,681 --> 01:24:19,960
it's like confirmation
bias and all that shit.

3372
01:24:19,961 --> 01:24:20,561
You know what I mean?

3373
01:24:20,561 --> 01:24:23,740
Like you so scary having
people in payroll,

3374
01:24:24,730 --> 01:24:27,010
people being in control is so dangerous.

3375
01:24:27,370 --> 01:24:28,060
And cops,

3376
01:24:28,060 --> 01:24:28,241
you know,

3377
01:24:28,241 --> 01:24:29,074
the truth is,

3378
01:24:29,170 --> 01:24:29,351
you know,

3379
01:24:29,351 --> 01:24:31,030
people talk to me about
firearms a little bit.

3380
01:24:31,050 --> 01:24:31,270
You know,

3381
01:24:31,270 --> 01:24:34,480
cause I spent about three
weeks straight training farms.

3382
01:24:34,480 --> 01:24:36,460
It's one of the best firearms
instructors in the country.

3383
01:24:36,461 --> 01:24:36,770
This guy,

3384
01:24:36,770 --> 01:24:38,020
tiger monkey and Alabama.

3385
01:24:39,010 --> 01:24:40,930
And you know,

3386
01:24:41,410 --> 01:24:46,410
you have to train your ass off to use
a gun successfully in an altercation.

3387
01:24:47,261 --> 01:24:49,570
Like because of what we've talked about,

3388
01:24:49,571 --> 01:24:50,051
this stress,

3389
01:24:50,051 --> 01:24:51,270
what stress does to you,

3390
01:24:51,850 --> 01:24:52,090
you know,

3391
01:24:52,090 --> 01:24:52,601
and cops,

3392
01:24:52,601 --> 01:24:53,860
the most police,

3393
01:24:53,890 --> 01:24:54,071
you know,

3394
01:24:54,071 --> 01:24:54,171
they,

3395
01:24:54,171 --> 01:24:55,570
they have the budget to train,

3396
01:24:55,571 --> 01:24:55,751
you know,

3397
01:24:55,751 --> 01:24:58,660
a couple of days a year
and they never get a train,

3398
01:24:58,661 --> 01:24:58,841
you know,

3399
01:24:58,841 --> 01:24:59,471
hand to hand.

3400
01:24:59,471 --> 01:24:59,700
So they,

3401
01:24:59,700 --> 01:25:00,000
they,

3402
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:00,230
they,

3403
01:25:00,230 --> 01:25:02,620
they really don't get
paid enough to shoot.

3404
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:04,840
Swat team guys are different and
they get paid to shoot enough,

3405
01:25:04,841 --> 01:25:05,141
you know,

3406
01:25:05,141 --> 01:25:06,940
and ammunitions expensive and blah blah.

3407
01:25:07,240 --> 01:25:09,130
But even cops,

3408
01:25:09,160 --> 01:25:10,690
like they just don't shoot enough,

3409
01:25:10,720 --> 01:25:10,991
you know.

3410
01:25:10,991 --> 01:25:15,520
So like the idea of arming teachers is
fine as long as you're going to pay for

3411
01:25:15,521 --> 01:25:17,890
them to train and train a lot.

3412
01:25:18,610 --> 01:25:19,780
They going to train every month.

3413
01:25:19,930 --> 01:25:20,720
Yeah,

3414
01:25:20,720 --> 01:25:25,390
they're going to be part of their life
or they're not going to be able to do it

3415
01:25:25,391 --> 01:25:26,380
and it's not going to work.

3416
01:25:26,381 --> 01:25:26,591
You know?

3417
01:25:26,591 --> 01:25:27,281
It's pointless.

3418
01:25:27,281 --> 01:25:29,470
It's more dangerous because
then you have guns around.

3419
01:25:29,500 --> 01:25:31,180
Someone else can tell me there was,

3420
01:25:31,710 --> 01:25:32,140
I don't know,

3421
01:25:32,140 --> 01:25:32,591
whatever,

3422
01:25:32,591 --> 01:25:33,790
but it's like it's just you.

3423
01:25:33,880 --> 01:25:34,960
This is a fact,

3424
01:25:34,961 --> 01:25:38,470
like you have to train your ass off with
a weapon with a firearm because again,

3425
01:25:38,471 --> 01:25:38,680
it's,

3426
01:25:38,680 --> 01:25:39,940
it's complex motor skills.

3427
01:25:39,941 --> 01:25:43,570
It's not intuitive and even that doesn't
guarantee that you're going to be able

3428
01:25:43,571 --> 01:25:45,700
to perform under stressful situations.

3429
01:25:45,850 --> 01:25:50,500
How do you condition yourself to
perform under stressful situations?

3430
01:25:50,530 --> 01:25:51,363
Like what is,

3431
01:25:51,940 --> 01:25:52,870
if you were going,

3432
01:25:52,900 --> 01:25:53,410
it's like say,

3433
01:25:53,410 --> 01:25:54,243
okay look,

3434
01:25:54,460 --> 01:25:55,850
it's what the number 10 let's put,

3435
01:25:55,870 --> 01:25:57,480
let's pretend the end
of the world is coming.

3436
01:25:57,500 --> 01:26:00,670
Some Sheridan has his own branch
and the Sam Sheraton ranch,

3437
01:26:00,671 --> 01:26:03,040
you're going to figure out a way to train,

3438
01:26:03,080 --> 01:26:04,570
train people how to do.

3439
01:26:04,580 --> 01:26:05,190
You're going to come.

3440
01:26:05,190 --> 01:26:06,260
And that's what the military does.

3441
01:26:06,261 --> 01:26:08,720
So you do as much as you can in terms of,

3442
01:26:09,060 --> 01:26:09,290
you know,

3443
01:26:09,290 --> 01:26:10,310
loud noises,

3444
01:26:10,330 --> 01:26:11,163
a smoke,

3445
01:26:11,390 --> 01:26:11,840
uh,

3446
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:12,530
you know,

3447
01:26:12,530 --> 01:26:13,130
fear,

3448
01:26:13,130 --> 01:26:15,380
unexpected things happening and you know,

3449
01:26:15,410 --> 01:26:15,641
and,

3450
01:26:15,641 --> 01:26:18,050
and realistically recreate these scenes.

3451
01:26:18,470 --> 01:26:18,651
You know,

3452
01:26:18,651 --> 01:26:22,610
they find when people are
shooting at human targets,

3453
01:26:22,611 --> 01:26:23,150
the targets,

3454
01:26:23,150 --> 01:26:25,040
even silhouettes that
looked like a person,

3455
01:26:25,070 --> 01:26:28,960
they're much better at killing people
in battle then if they're shooting it at

3456
01:26:28,970 --> 01:26:31,460
just the crosshairs or just to Bullseye.

3457
01:26:31,630 --> 01:26:32,000
Hmm.

3458
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:33,230
So you'd have to condition,

3459
01:26:33,231 --> 01:26:33,441
you know,

3460
01:26:33,441 --> 01:26:34,041
that's what they have.

3461
01:26:34,041 --> 01:26:38,630
All those houses that they walk
through and you train and train.

3462
01:26:38,631 --> 01:26:39,620
That's what Swat teams do.

3463
01:26:39,621 --> 01:26:40,610
And Swat teams do great.

3464
01:26:40,611 --> 01:26:40,791
You know,

3465
01:26:40,791 --> 01:26:43,220
because they train and train
and train and train and train,

3466
01:26:43,221 --> 01:26:44,390
and then they can,

3467
01:26:44,420 --> 01:26:45,350
they can execute it,

3468
01:26:45,351 --> 01:26:45,591
you know?

3469
01:26:45,591 --> 01:26:47,180
And also swat members,

3470
01:26:47,181 --> 01:26:48,680
they're probably been on a few of those.

3471
01:26:48,680 --> 01:26:51,740
By the time he gets to a
certain point in their career,

3472
01:26:52,380 --> 01:26:53,213
you know,

3473
01:26:53,750 --> 01:26:54,411
it's not his first,

3474
01:26:54,411 --> 01:26:54,640
you know,

3475
01:26:54,640 --> 01:26:56,860
he's on these a lot of times and,

3476
01:26:56,861 --> 01:26:57,230
and,

3477
01:26:57,230 --> 01:26:58,160
and even those guys,

3478
01:26:58,490 --> 01:27:00,530
they can get so hyped up
that they make mistakes,

3479
01:27:00,531 --> 01:27:00,801
you know?

3480
01:27:00,801 --> 01:27:01,630
And it happens.

3481
01:27:01,630 --> 01:27:03,850
And the tiger was telling me that like,

3482
01:27:03,860 --> 01:27:05,150
there was a police,

3483
01:27:05,180 --> 01:27:05,630
uh,

3484
01:27:05,630 --> 01:27:06,710
house to walk through it,

3485
01:27:06,711 --> 01:27:06,890
you know,

3486
01:27:06,890 --> 01:27:07,401
for a shooting.

3487
01:27:07,401 --> 01:27:08,234
And there was a,

3488
01:27:08,630 --> 01:27:09,370
uh,

3489
01:27:09,370 --> 01:27:09,620
you know,

3490
01:27:09,620 --> 01:27:14,270
a four foot by four foot bullet
trap that was behind the target.

3491
01:27:14,271 --> 01:27:14,931
So there's a target,

3492
01:27:14,931 --> 01:27:15,101
you know,

3493
01:27:15,101 --> 01:27:17,930
like a person and they walked to the
door and they have to draw and shoot this

3494
01:27:17,931 --> 01:27:20,990
thing and guys are missing the
trap from like six feet away.

3495
01:27:21,020 --> 01:27:21,590
Whoa.

3496
01:27:21,590 --> 01:27:22,423
So they're just going,

3497
01:27:22,460 --> 01:27:22,880
Eh,

3498
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:24,580
and they're shooting into
the air or the shooting,

3499
01:27:24,630 --> 01:27:24,840
you know,

3500
01:27:24,840 --> 01:27:26,120
and these are cops,

3501
01:27:26,150 --> 01:27:26,660
you know what I mean?

3502
01:27:26,660 --> 01:27:28,130
It's not you and me who was never like,

3503
01:27:28,131 --> 01:27:28,610
oh,

3504
01:27:28,610 --> 01:27:29,090
ah,

3505
01:27:29,090 --> 01:27:29,601
you know what I mean?

3506
01:27:29,601 --> 01:27:30,434
It's like they,

3507
01:27:30,950 --> 01:27:31,640
they,

3508
01:27:31,640 --> 01:27:32,090
and,

3509
01:27:32,090 --> 01:27:34,630
and this whole thing about the
knife being better than the gun.

3510
01:27:34,650 --> 01:27:35,483
You ever hear that one?

3511
01:27:35,870 --> 01:27:36,320
No.

3512
01:27:36,320 --> 01:27:36,710
So the,

3513
01:27:36,710 --> 01:27:37,100
so,

3514
01:27:37,100 --> 01:27:37,290
uh,

3515
01:27:37,290 --> 01:27:38,110
there's a thing called the,

3516
01:27:38,110 --> 01:27:39,050
the taller rule,

3517
01:27:39,051 --> 01:27:39,861
the Tula rule,

3518
01:27:39,861 --> 01:27:41,090
which is a,

3519
01:27:41,200 --> 01:27:43,120
a cop in Vegas in the 80s,

3520
01:27:43,160 --> 01:27:43,450
um,

3521
01:27:43,450 --> 01:27:44,380
started timing,

3522
01:27:44,850 --> 01:27:45,500
uh,

3523
01:27:45,500 --> 01:27:49,910
how long it would take for a guy to cut
you with a knife before you could hold

3524
01:27:49,970 --> 01:27:53,000
on holster and get your gun
out and present and shoot him.

3525
01:27:53,510 --> 01:27:55,790
And he found that from 21 feet or less,

3526
01:27:55,820 --> 01:27:58,490
he was going to get you before
you could get a shot off.

3527
01:27:58,730 --> 01:27:59,420
Oh,

3528
01:27:59,420 --> 01:28:00,800
so they call it the 21 foot rule.

3529
01:28:00,801 --> 01:28:04,460
So if a guy has a knife
and he's closer in 21 feet,

3530
01:28:04,490 --> 01:28:05,510
you got to shoot him.

3531
01:28:05,511 --> 01:28:06,540
Or you know,

3532
01:28:06,570 --> 01:28:09,290
you think you think all the guns better,

3533
01:28:09,350 --> 01:28:10,070
I want a gun.

3534
01:28:10,070 --> 01:28:11,810
But actually because it's,

3535
01:28:11,930 --> 01:28:12,860
it doesn't jam,

3536
01:28:13,430 --> 01:28:14,390
it doesn't screw up.

3537
01:28:14,540 --> 01:28:15,680
It's not fine motor skill.

3538
01:28:15,681 --> 01:28:16,940
This is not a fine motor skill,

3539
01:28:16,941 --> 01:28:17,151
right?

3540
01:28:17,151 --> 01:28:17,570
This is,

3541
01:28:17,570 --> 01:28:18,020
this is,

3542
01:28:18,020 --> 01:28:18,853
this is simple.

3543
01:28:19,040 --> 01:28:20,150
You know how to do this.

3544
01:28:20,510 --> 01:28:21,320
You're born,

3545
01:28:21,320 --> 01:28:21,951
you're going to die.

3546
01:28:21,951 --> 01:28:25,760
No one had a hit somebody with
a knife and it never goes away.

3547
01:28:25,790 --> 01:28:27,680
Even how stressed you are.

3548
01:28:27,681 --> 01:28:30,410
So that's one of the reasons why they
actually say a knife is better than the

3549
01:28:30,411 --> 01:28:34,050
gun in a lot of situations is corrected.

3550
01:28:34,100 --> 01:28:34,790
A huge,

3551
01:28:34,790 --> 01:28:36,890
I did a long training
session of knife fighting,

3552
01:28:36,891 --> 01:28:37,370
which is,

3553
01:28:37,370 --> 01:28:38,780
I'm want to get nightmare nightmares,

3554
01:28:38,781 --> 01:28:39,350
dude.

3555
01:28:39,350 --> 01:28:39,980
Nightmares.

3556
01:28:39,980 --> 01:28:40,910
It's terrible.

3557
01:28:41,690 --> 01:28:44,090
What happens once you
start getting intellect?

3558
01:28:44,690 --> 01:28:46,970
The awfulness of getting cut open.

3559
01:28:47,270 --> 01:28:47,660
Yeah.

3560
01:28:47,660 --> 01:28:49,670
It's an awful [inaudible] Jujitsu,

3561
01:28:50,350 --> 01:28:50,630
you know?

3562
01:28:50,630 --> 01:28:52,310
It's like I have a knife.

3563
01:28:52,850 --> 01:28:53,360
Good luck.

3564
01:28:53,360 --> 01:28:55,390
It doesn't matte black belt.

3565
01:28:55,420 --> 01:28:55,780
I'm just,

3566
01:28:55,780 --> 01:28:56,181
it's like,

3567
01:28:56,181 --> 01:28:57,500
it just starts going and you never,

3568
01:28:57,501 --> 01:28:58,370
you can't turn it off.

3569
01:28:58,430 --> 01:28:58,761
It's like,

3570
01:28:58,761 --> 01:28:59,570
it just keeps going.

3571
01:28:59,570 --> 01:29:00,470
As long as it's sharp,

3572
01:29:00,471 --> 01:29:00,711
you know?

3573
01:29:00,711 --> 01:29:02,040
It's easy.

3574
01:29:02,041 --> 01:29:02,460
Yeah.

3575
01:29:02,460 --> 01:29:03,293
It's terrible.

3576
01:29:03,360 --> 01:29:03,651
Yeah.

3577
01:29:03,651 --> 01:29:06,660
Collin and I talked about that
when we came to butchering a deer.

3578
01:29:06,661 --> 01:29:08,770
Like though the reality of questions,

3579
01:29:08,820 --> 01:29:09,653
it opens up.

3580
01:29:09,700 --> 01:29:10,530
Yeah.

3581
01:29:10,530 --> 01:29:12,390
With this razor knife protein.

3582
01:29:12,420 --> 01:29:12,990
Yeah.

3583
01:29:12,990 --> 01:29:14,400
Flesh just sorta separates.

3584
01:29:14,560 --> 01:29:14,831
Yeah.

3585
01:29:14,831 --> 01:29:18,210
It's not difficult to separate
the essential parts of your body.

3586
01:29:18,370 --> 01:29:19,470
It's like an uncooked egg.

3587
01:29:19,500 --> 01:29:19,890
Yeah.

3588
01:29:19,890 --> 01:29:21,450
It's not like a hard boiled egg.

3589
01:29:21,480 --> 01:29:21,811
It's like,

3590
01:29:21,811 --> 01:29:24,990
that's what your skin and flesh
like and that's what these knife,

3591
01:29:25,230 --> 01:29:26,400
the knife stuff is about you.

3592
01:29:26,401 --> 01:29:27,570
Like you don't like,

3593
01:29:27,571 --> 01:29:28,404
I don't like,

3594
01:29:28,520 --> 01:29:28,780
you know,

3595
01:29:28,780 --> 01:29:29,190
so you've,

3596
01:29:29,190 --> 01:29:30,240
you've punched me.

3597
01:29:30,241 --> 01:29:32,190
I don't just cut your arm and I like that.

3598
01:29:32,191 --> 01:29:33,810
I go and I shave,

3599
01:29:33,840 --> 01:29:34,051
you know,

3600
01:29:34,051 --> 01:29:38,910
a huge slap a skin off your arm and
now think now what are you doing?

3601
01:29:38,960 --> 01:29:40,310
Like now your mind is your,

3602
01:29:40,370 --> 01:29:40,590
yeah,

3603
01:29:40,590 --> 01:29:41,580
you're not thinking about me anymore.

3604
01:29:41,760 --> 01:29:42,300
Yeah,

3605
01:29:42,300 --> 01:29:42,660
you're not,

3606
01:29:42,660 --> 01:29:43,140
you know.

3607
01:29:43,140 --> 01:29:44,460
Well they also say that some of the knife,

3608
01:29:44,461 --> 01:29:47,550
it's very easy for them to punch you in
the face because you're so concentrated

3609
01:29:47,551 --> 01:29:49,920
on that knife that kick you in
the balls and punch in the face.

3610
01:29:49,921 --> 01:29:50,361
Like you,

3611
01:29:50,361 --> 01:29:51,510
you really focused on it.

3612
01:29:51,570 --> 01:29:52,980
You won't even stop it.

3613
01:29:53,070 --> 01:29:54,900
We used to do like spark,

3614
01:29:54,930 --> 01:29:57,060
like last part with like these little um,

3615
01:29:57,390 --> 01:29:58,020
uh,

3616
01:29:58,020 --> 01:29:59,210
like stun blades,

3617
01:30:00,160 --> 01:30:00,880
blades.

3618
01:30:00,880 --> 01:30:02,130
It's got like a little shock to it.

3619
01:30:02,220 --> 01:30:02,660
Like it's,

3620
01:30:02,660 --> 01:30:02,771
you know,

3621
01:30:02,771 --> 01:30:03,604
it's like a bee sting,

3622
01:30:04,150 --> 01:30:04,650
um,

3623
01:30:04,650 --> 01:30:05,760
shocking electric shock knife.

3624
01:30:05,761 --> 01:30:05,941
Yeah.

3625
01:30:05,941 --> 01:30:07,080
Cause he ain't company makes him,

3626
01:30:07,081 --> 01:30:07,311
yeah,

3627
01:30:07,311 --> 01:30:07,490
yeah,

3628
01:30:07,490 --> 01:30:07,711
yeah.

3629
01:30:07,711 --> 01:30:08,850
And the crackle and they,

3630
01:30:09,150 --> 01:30:11,230
they crack the crackling is almost
scarier because you're like,

3631
01:30:12,140 --> 01:30:12,973
cause it's,

3632
01:30:13,860 --> 01:30:14,940
it's like the sound,

3633
01:30:14,941 --> 01:30:16,230
it sounds like a light saber or something,

3634
01:30:16,310 --> 01:30:16,890
you know,

3635
01:30:16,890 --> 01:30:17,611
it's like a beast thing.

3636
01:30:17,611 --> 01:30:17,880
You're like,

3637
01:30:17,880 --> 01:30:18,240
oh,

3638
01:30:18,240 --> 01:30:19,110
that's not that big a deal.

3639
01:30:19,110 --> 01:30:21,060
But it's the idea that
you just got chopped.

3640
01:30:21,720 --> 01:30:22,553
And uh,

3641
01:30:22,710 --> 01:30:23,700
I was doing it in fighting,

3642
01:30:23,701 --> 01:30:23,941
you know,

3643
01:30:23,941 --> 01:30:24,481
and whatever.

3644
01:30:24,481 --> 01:30:26,820
And the worst is when you
don't have a knife and he does,

3645
01:30:27,140 --> 01:30:28,740
this is just the lambs to slaughter dude.

3646
01:30:28,741 --> 01:30:29,574
You're like,

3647
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:31,140
you're hyperventilating.

3648
01:30:31,141 --> 01:30:32,640
Like trying to time the jump,

3649
01:30:33,470 --> 01:30:34,890
like got something like God,

3650
01:30:35,140 --> 01:30:35,641
I'm down.

3651
01:30:35,641 --> 01:30:38,100
I took his back and I had the knife in
one hand and I was trying to get the

3652
01:30:38,101 --> 01:30:42,390
choke in and it was like I had to let
it go because I couldn't hold that knife

3653
01:30:42,780 --> 01:30:43,120
with one.

3654
01:30:43,120 --> 01:30:46,410
Actually I think I had the knife and he
was going to take it away from me and I

3655
01:30:46,411 --> 01:30:47,400
started choking him cause I'm like,

3656
01:30:47,430 --> 01:30:47,551
oh,

3657
01:30:47,551 --> 01:30:48,301
they'll give them something to think.

3658
01:30:48,301 --> 01:30:48,930
And like I had,

3659
01:30:48,930 --> 01:30:49,411
I couldn't,

3660
01:30:49,411 --> 01:30:54,411
I had to stay with that knife because
it was so devastating that the choke was

3661
01:30:55,081 --> 01:30:55,261
like,

3662
01:30:55,261 --> 01:30:55,680
he's like,

3663
01:30:55,680 --> 01:30:56,310
he doesn't give a shit.

3664
01:30:56,310 --> 01:30:57,480
He can because he knows it's not,

3665
01:30:57,810 --> 01:30:58,800
I can't get them in,

3666
01:30:59,040 --> 01:30:59,400
you know,

3667
01:30:59,400 --> 01:31:00,151
15 seconds.

3668
01:31:00,151 --> 01:31:01,890
He's going to have the knife
and he's going to start,

3669
01:31:02,680 --> 01:31:03,513
you know,

3670
01:31:04,490 --> 01:31:05,310
what are the,

3671
01:31:05,310 --> 01:31:05,870
uh,

3672
01:31:05,870 --> 01:31:06,601
did you like,

3673
01:31:06,601 --> 01:31:07,440
do like a,

3674
01:31:07,950 --> 01:31:09,600
when you have a knife fight in class,

3675
01:31:09,630 --> 01:31:11,820
do you use a rubber ninth?

3676
01:31:11,850 --> 01:31:12,001
Yeah.

3677
01:31:12,001 --> 01:31:12,840
You do rubber knives,

3678
01:31:12,970 --> 01:31:13,720
real knives too,

3679
01:31:13,720 --> 01:31:15,560
just to kind of have
techniques that you love.

3680
01:31:15,570 --> 01:31:15,850
Yeah,

3681
01:31:15,850 --> 01:31:16,570
yeah.

3682
01:31:16,570 --> 01:31:17,560
One of disagreement,

3683
01:31:17,580 --> 01:31:17,800
you know,

3684
01:31:17,800 --> 01:31:21,150
so it's a lot of it's from Filipino
stick fighting and the Philippines is

3685
01:31:21,151 --> 01:31:23,160
famously the place where,

3686
01:31:23,161 --> 01:31:23,431
you know,

3687
01:31:23,431 --> 01:31:26,220
this was like an art form
and they were invaded by,

3688
01:31:26,270 --> 01:31:26,790
uh,

3689
01:31:26,790 --> 01:31:30,930
all kinds of sorted people so that
the Spaniards came and the Portuguese

3690
01:31:30,931 --> 01:31:31,441
invaded.

3691
01:31:31,441 --> 01:31:32,650
And then the Japanese came with,

3692
01:31:32,710 --> 01:31:33,040
so they,

3693
01:31:33,040 --> 01:31:35,880
they've been exposed to
all these styles and,

3694
01:31:35,881 --> 01:31:36,450
uh,

3695
01:31:36,450 --> 01:31:36,730
the,

3696
01:31:36,730 --> 01:31:37,610
the name and it's like,

3697
01:31:37,620 --> 01:31:39,360
I think Palau is that people have a knife.

3698
01:31:39,361 --> 01:31:39,690
So,

3699
01:31:39,690 --> 01:31:40,080
you know,

3700
01:31:40,080 --> 01:31:40,860
it's very,

3701
01:31:40,860 --> 01:31:41,430
you know,

3702
01:31:41,430 --> 01:31:42,241
a part of their culture.

3703
01:31:42,241 --> 01:31:45,870
And also they were enslaved for 300 years.

3704
01:31:45,930 --> 01:31:46,351
You know what I mean?

3705
01:31:46,351 --> 01:31:48,090
They were longer than
America's been a country.

3706
01:31:48,091 --> 01:31:51,300
They were a colony of Spain and
then the u s and all that stuff.

3707
01:31:51,301 --> 01:31:53,910
So they've got that in their system.

3708
01:31:53,911 --> 01:31:57,240
And then so they've really turned
knife fighting into a high art.

3709
01:31:57,241 --> 01:31:57,751
And I love it.

3710
01:31:57,751 --> 01:31:58,650
And you scream was really fun.

3711
01:31:58,651 --> 01:31:59,590
I actually got really into it.

3712
01:31:59,620 --> 01:32:00,120
Does it scream

3713
01:32:00,120 --> 01:32:01,540
out or Filipino arts?

3714
01:32:01,541 --> 01:32:02,470
Do they have any,

3715
01:32:02,471 --> 01:32:02,920
uh,

3716
01:32:02,920 --> 01:32:03,661
striking arms?

3717
01:32:03,661 --> 01:32:03,950
Yeah,

3718
01:32:03,950 --> 01:32:05,720
well they do a boxing thing and,

3719
01:32:05,721 --> 01:32:05,950
and,

3720
01:32:05,950 --> 01:32:06,880
and um,

3721
01:32:07,360 --> 01:32:07,750
you know,

3722
01:32:07,750 --> 01:32:09,670
people talk about Manny Pacquiao doing,

3723
01:32:09,830 --> 01:32:10,663
you know,

3724
01:32:11,560 --> 01:32:12,850
what is it that it was a call,

3725
01:32:12,851 --> 01:32:13,331
I don't know,

3726
01:32:13,331 --> 01:32:13,681
but it's,

3727
01:32:13,681 --> 01:32:14,451
it's part of a screen.

3728
01:32:14,451 --> 01:32:15,550
But basically it's all part of this.

3729
01:32:15,551 --> 01:32:17,020
And the screen was even a Spanish word,

3730
01:32:17,021 --> 01:32:17,191
you know,

3731
01:32:17,191 --> 01:32:17,771
and people,

3732
01:32:17,771 --> 01:32:18,281
I think there's,

3733
01:32:18,281 --> 01:32:19,060
um,

3734
01:32:19,060 --> 01:32:21,310
a Filipino movements that
kind of reclaimed the art.

3735
01:32:21,311 --> 01:32:22,144
But the arts,

3736
01:32:22,690 --> 01:32:23,321
the whole nature of,

3737
01:32:23,321 --> 01:32:24,220
it's very democratic.

3738
01:32:24,221 --> 01:32:27,400
Like it comes from everywhere and it's
got all kinds of different terms and it's

3739
01:32:27,401 --> 01:32:27,881
very,

3740
01:32:27,881 --> 01:32:28,690
it's very,

3741
01:32:28,690 --> 01:32:29,620
it's very inclusive.

3742
01:32:29,670 --> 01:32:30,180
I'm not,

3743
01:32:30,180 --> 01:32:31,001
correct me if I'm wrong,

3744
01:32:31,001 --> 01:32:35,770
but were the Philippines created by
Chinese and Spaniards getting together?

3745
01:32:35,771 --> 01:32:36,604
Isn't that like,

3746
01:32:36,970 --> 01:32:37,803
yeah,

3747
01:32:38,020 --> 01:32:41,550
it was a Spanish colony for a long time
and they were invaded by everybody.

3748
01:32:41,560 --> 01:32:41,981
Like they,

3749
01:32:41,981 --> 01:32:42,161
you know,

3750
01:32:42,161 --> 01:32:43,210
they were islanders.

3751
01:32:43,270 --> 01:32:43,920
It was,

3752
01:32:43,920 --> 01:32:44,753
you know,

3753
01:32:44,920 --> 01:32:45,491
Micronesia,

3754
01:32:45,491 --> 01:32:46,261
whatever stuff.

3755
01:32:46,261 --> 01:32:48,130
And that's the real fucking problem,

3756
01:32:48,131 --> 01:32:48,460
man.

3757
01:32:48,460 --> 01:32:53,440
That's what we've sort of limited more
than ever before is people invading

3758
01:32:53,441 --> 01:32:55,090
people just taking over their land.

3759
01:32:55,091 --> 01:32:55,750
We've sort of,

3760
01:32:55,750 --> 01:32:59,260
that's slowed down quite a bit
still going on when we're doing it.

3761
01:32:59,530 --> 01:33:02,860
But like if you look at like what
you used to have to deal with,

3762
01:33:03,190 --> 01:33:04,011
like most of the world,

3763
01:33:04,011 --> 01:33:04,811
but it's like sitting down,

3764
01:33:04,811 --> 01:33:05,051
man,

3765
01:33:05,051 --> 01:33:05,980
I hope nobody shows up.

3766
01:33:06,090 --> 01:33:06,870
Yeah.

3767
01:33:06,870 --> 01:33:07,930
Somebody showed up dead.

3768
01:33:08,070 --> 01:33:08,590
Yeah.

3769
01:33:08,590 --> 01:33:11,350
It wasn't like if you were
an American you could just,

3770
01:33:11,351 --> 01:33:12,580
well there was no Americans obviously,

3771
01:33:12,581 --> 01:33:14,110
but if you were an Irishman,

3772
01:33:14,111 --> 01:33:15,520
you could just say all the way to Fiji,

3773
01:33:15,521 --> 01:33:16,200
they would eat you.

3774
01:33:16,200 --> 01:33:16,420
Yeah.

3775
01:33:16,420 --> 01:33:16,620
You know,

3776
01:33:16,620 --> 01:33:19,810
you couldn't just show up and
Bornea they would fucking kill.

3777
01:33:19,811 --> 01:33:19,991
You know,

3778
01:33:19,991 --> 01:33:21,160
they talk about how dangerous,

3779
01:33:21,210 --> 01:33:21,490
uh,

3780
01:33:21,490 --> 01:33:22,510
in Papa New Guinea,

3781
01:33:22,511 --> 01:33:22,820
they,

3782
01:33:22,820 --> 01:33:25,810
there are people that hadn't
been contacted and they
talk about how dangerous

3783
01:33:25,811 --> 01:33:26,560
strangers are.

3784
01:33:26,560 --> 01:33:26,741
Like,

3785
01:33:26,741 --> 01:33:29,290
it's so dangerous to meet new people.

3786
01:33:29,291 --> 01:33:31,570
It's like everybody is on red alert.

3787
01:33:31,670 --> 01:33:32,503
What did you hear about that,

3788
01:33:32,530 --> 01:33:34,090
those fishermen that were killed recently?

3789
01:33:34,180 --> 01:33:34,570
No.

3790
01:33:34,570 --> 01:33:34,961
Yeah,

3791
01:33:34,961 --> 01:33:39,550
the one of the last uncontacted
tribe did day and these people,

3792
01:33:39,551 --> 01:33:39,821
they,

3793
01:33:39,821 --> 01:33:41,750
they fucked up and they wound up a short,

3794
01:33:41,751 --> 01:33:43,870
they were drunk and they
were in a fishing boat.

3795
01:33:44,080 --> 01:33:44,711
I think it's,

3796
01:33:44,711 --> 01:33:44,811
I,

3797
01:33:44,811 --> 01:33:46,300
I want to say New Guinea,

3798
01:33:46,970 --> 01:33:47,621
some left.

3799
01:33:47,621 --> 01:33:50,680
Apparently there's something
Central America and South America.

3800
01:33:50,681 --> 01:33:50,951
I mean,

3801
01:33:50,951 --> 01:33:53,320
there's killed New Guinea.

3802
01:33:53,800 --> 01:33:54,633
Uh,

3803
01:33:55,330 --> 01:33:55,721
the,

3804
01:33:55,721 --> 01:33:55,841
uh,

3805
01:33:55,841 --> 01:33:56,800
the story was that they,

3806
01:33:56,801 --> 01:33:57,011
uh,

3807
01:33:57,011 --> 01:34:01,450
they had gotten drunk and they washed
up on the shore in the wrong place.

3808
01:34:01,470 --> 01:34:02,140
Yeah.

3809
01:34:02,140 --> 01:34:02,410
They,

3810
01:34:02,410 --> 01:34:02,950
they,

3811
01:34:02,950 --> 01:34:05,740
they fucked up and these
people were there and uh,

3812
01:34:05,830 --> 01:34:07,060
they just fucking,

3813
01:34:07,061 --> 01:34:07,561
they killed him,

3814
01:34:07,561 --> 01:34:08,394
man.

3815
01:34:09,170 --> 01:34:09,730
Yeah.

3816
01:34:09,730 --> 01:34:10,330
And that,

3817
01:34:10,330 --> 01:34:10,800
this,

3818
01:34:10,800 --> 01:34:12,700
this one uncontacted tribe.

3819
01:34:12,760 --> 01:34:12,911
Yeah.

3820
01:34:12,911 --> 01:34:13,600
They don't,

3821
01:34:13,600 --> 01:34:16,090
and they have to wait until they
want to retrieve the bodies,

3822
01:34:16,091 --> 01:34:18,400
but they have to wait until these people
move to the other side of the island.

3823
01:34:18,400 --> 01:34:20,320
These natives because
if they go over there,

3824
01:34:20,321 --> 01:34:21,190
they're going to have to kill them.

3825
01:34:21,810 --> 01:34:22,241
And they're the,

3826
01:34:22,241 --> 01:34:25,330
like the last of these tribes and these,

3827
01:34:25,331 --> 01:34:25,481
uh,

3828
01:34:25,481 --> 01:34:29,950
these poor drunk fishermen just fucked
up and drifted a shore and they just

3829
01:34:29,951 --> 01:34:30,784
jacked him.

3830
01:34:30,860 --> 01:34:31,210
Yeah.

3831
01:34:31,210 --> 01:34:31,641
And again,

3832
01:34:31,641 --> 01:34:32,351
that goes back to like,

3833
01:34:32,351 --> 01:34:33,670
what's most of human history,

3834
01:34:33,671 --> 01:34:34,031
Ben?

3835
01:34:34,031 --> 01:34:34,400
That,

3836
01:34:34,400 --> 01:34:34,890
yeah.

3837
01:34:34,890 --> 01:34:37,720
I mean not this modern thing where you
get in the subway and there's people you

3838
01:34:37,721 --> 01:34:38,860
don't know right behind you.

3839
01:34:38,990 --> 01:34:39,823
Right,

3840
01:34:40,110 --> 01:34:40,510
right.

3841
01:34:40,510 --> 01:34:40,930
Yeah.

3842
01:34:40,930 --> 01:34:43,420
Or that you don't even speak their
language and you're staying at the four

3843
01:34:43,421 --> 01:34:44,950
season and it's file and then,

3844
01:34:44,980 --> 01:34:45,250
you know,

3845
01:34:45,250 --> 01:34:46,210
and they're cleaning your room.

3846
01:34:47,470 --> 01:34:47,621
Well,

3847
01:34:47,621 --> 01:34:48,390
you are,

3848
01:34:48,390 --> 01:34:49,001
it's a weird,

3849
01:34:49,001 --> 01:34:49,834
or whatever,

3850
01:34:51,030 --> 01:34:52,050
any hotel,

3851
01:34:52,080 --> 01:34:53,380
but it'd be even crazier.

3852
01:34:53,381 --> 01:34:53,820
How about,

3853
01:34:53,820 --> 01:34:54,071
you know,

3854
01:34:54,071 --> 01:34:56,200
you go to one of those things that,

3855
01:34:56,201 --> 01:34:56,810
uh,

3856
01:34:56,810 --> 01:34:57,650
students do.

3857
01:34:58,040 --> 01:34:58,940
What do they stay at those,

3858
01:34:58,941 --> 01:34:59,320
uh,

3859
01:34:59,320 --> 01:35:00,153
the hostels,

3860
01:35:00,860 --> 01:35:03,730
dorm room fill you of other people that
speak a language you don't understand

3861
01:35:03,740 --> 01:35:04,670
you're sleeping together.

3862
01:35:04,671 --> 01:35:05,180
Yeah.

3863
01:35:05,180 --> 01:35:05,930
I mean,

3864
01:35:05,930 --> 01:35:07,460
that's a modern society.

3865
01:35:07,461 --> 01:35:07,820
Yeah.

3866
01:35:07,820 --> 01:35:09,050
It's fascinating.

3867
01:35:09,140 --> 01:35:11,300
And so in that sense,

3868
01:35:11,330 --> 01:35:13,880
it's much safer now than ever before,

3869
01:35:13,881 --> 01:35:18,410
but that could all erode
immediately with one astro.

3870
01:35:18,560 --> 01:35:19,340
Yeah.

3871
01:35:19,340 --> 01:35:19,581
Yeah.

3872
01:35:19,581 --> 01:35:19,761
No,

3873
01:35:19,761 --> 01:35:20,470
there was a great,

3874
01:35:20,470 --> 01:35:21,080
uh,

3875
01:35:21,080 --> 01:35:21,501
hold on,

3876
01:35:21,501 --> 01:35:22,334
let me just,

3877
01:35:22,400 --> 01:35:23,233
talking about the asteroids,

3878
01:35:23,250 --> 01:35:23,850
did you,

3879
01:35:23,850 --> 01:35:25,350
do you follow at all?

3880
01:35:25,380 --> 01:35:25,830
Um,

3881
01:35:25,830 --> 01:35:26,260
like,

3882
01:35:26,260 --> 01:35:26,900
uh,

3883
01:35:26,900 --> 01:35:27,261
the,

3884
01:35:27,261 --> 01:35:29,880
the history of asteroidal
impacts or a little bit,

3885
01:35:30,100 --> 01:35:30,471
a little bit.

3886
01:35:30,471 --> 01:35:30,681
I mean,

3887
01:35:30,681 --> 01:35:31,970
I'm kind of this actually have a,

3888
01:35:31,990 --> 01:35:32,570
yeah,

3889
01:35:32,570 --> 01:35:33,171
not Clovis,

3890
01:35:33,171 --> 01:35:33,920
but I actually,

3891
01:35:33,920 --> 01:35:34,700
you know,

3892
01:35:34,700 --> 01:35:35,331
a little bit,

3893
01:35:35,331 --> 01:35:36,164
you know,

3894
01:35:36,250 --> 01:35:36,860
I'm into it,

3895
01:35:36,860 --> 01:35:37,370
you know what I mean?

3896
01:35:37,370 --> 01:35:38,203
That's cool.

3897
01:35:38,450 --> 01:35:39,283
Yeah.

3898
01:35:39,290 --> 01:35:43,100
Did you see the new thing that the
Russian scientists are Russian astronomers

3899
01:35:43,101 --> 01:35:43,641
have found?

3900
01:35:43,641 --> 01:35:46,160
They believe there's one that's
going to hit 93 years from now?

3901
01:35:46,250 --> 01:35:46,710
No,

3902
01:35:46,710 --> 01:35:46,890
it's,

3903
01:35:46,890 --> 01:35:47,091
yeah,

3904
01:35:47,091 --> 01:35:50,110
they think they found one
that's a real motherfucker.

3905
01:35:50,120 --> 01:35:50,660
Right.

3906
01:35:50,660 --> 01:35:53,000
That's going to hit that
Russian shit was scary.

3907
01:35:53,030 --> 01:35:53,421
Yes,

3908
01:35:53,421 --> 01:35:54,380
it was awesome.

3909
01:35:55,090 --> 01:35:55,710
I loved it.

3910
01:35:55,710 --> 01:35:57,920
I explained to people that might not have,

3911
01:35:58,010 --> 01:35:58,311
you know,

3912
01:35:58,311 --> 01:35:59,360
make getting up later.

3913
01:35:59,470 --> 01:35:59,870
Um,

3914
01:35:59,870 --> 01:36:01,990
the rush we're talking about
Russian media or impacts the,

3915
01:36:01,991 --> 01:36:03,080
the video footage,

3916
01:36:03,510 --> 01:36:03,900
uh,

3917
01:36:03,900 --> 01:36:05,510
that we were talking about
earlier with the cams,

3918
01:36:05,511 --> 01:36:06,344
the video cams,

3919
01:36:06,560 --> 01:36:08,300
these people than their dash cams,

3920
01:36:08,360 --> 01:36:10,310
the one where it hit and it's like,

3921
01:36:10,370 --> 01:36:11,000
boom.

3922
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:11,211
Right.

3923
01:36:11,211 --> 01:36:12,850
It was brighter than the
sun for a second half.

3924
01:36:12,851 --> 01:36:13,100
Fuck,

3925
01:36:13,100 --> 01:36:14,060
flash hit.

3926
01:36:14,140 --> 01:36:14,450
Let me,

3927
01:36:14,450 --> 01:36:14,961
let me read you this.

3928
01:36:14,961 --> 01:36:15,690
So this is what,

3929
01:36:15,690 --> 01:36:16,523
so there's,

3930
01:36:16,680 --> 01:36:21,680
I think there's about a thousand a year
of these little ones and then then the,

3931
01:36:23,730 --> 01:36:27,660
the rock of one third of a meter across
explodes with the a hundred tons of

3932
01:36:27,661 --> 01:36:28,440
dynamite.

3933
01:36:28,440 --> 01:36:29,850
And that happens 40 times a year,

3934
01:36:30,780 --> 01:36:34,650
three meters across the rock hits
with a force of 2000 tons of dynamite.

3935
01:36:35,340 --> 01:36:35,970
Oh my God.

3936
01:36:35,970 --> 01:36:37,380
And 30 meters,

3937
01:36:37,440 --> 01:36:38,970
it's now an asteroid.

3938
01:36:39,870 --> 01:36:40,730
And then if it,

3939
01:36:40,731 --> 01:36:44,130
if it hits its 2 million tons of dynamite
were flat and everything was in six

3940
01:36:44,131 --> 01:36:49,131
miles at a hundred meters and asteroid
is the equivalent of 80 million tons of

3941
01:36:49,411 --> 01:36:50,244
diamond light.

3942
01:36:50,340 --> 01:36:52,650
And that was what hit
in 1908 and flattened,

3943
01:36:52,670 --> 01:36:52,891
you know,

3944
01:36:52,891 --> 01:36:55,380
1200 miles of the forest in Siberia.

3945
01:36:56,440 --> 01:36:56,810
Is that,

3946
01:36:56,810 --> 01:36:57,970
that proven that a,

3947
01:36:57,971 --> 01:36:59,000
that's Tom Guskey right?

3948
01:36:59,001 --> 01:36:59,441
You go school.

3949
01:36:59,441 --> 01:36:59,970
Yes.

3950
01:36:59,970 --> 01:37:00,910
And you know that for a fact?

3951
01:37:00,970 --> 01:37:01,810
Well I think so.

3952
01:37:02,080 --> 01:37:02,913
And then,

3953
01:37:03,320 --> 01:37:07,300
and a half mile across the
crater is nine miles wide.

3954
01:37:07,301 --> 01:37:12,301
A fireball that is 25 times larger than
the sun and it's a 7.8 earthquake when

3955
01:37:13,121 --> 01:37:15,970
it hits and would cause nuclear
winter and in civilization,

3956
01:37:16,060 --> 01:37:16,893
Oh my God.

3957
01:37:16,960 --> 01:37:18,310
But the species would survive.

3958
01:37:18,910 --> 01:37:23,530
Then the next biggest one
up a six miles across plus,

3959
01:37:23,910 --> 01:37:24,370
uh,

3960
01:37:24,370 --> 01:37:25,840
is the end of everything.

3961
01:37:25,841 --> 01:37:27,040
And that's like what
happened to the dinosaurs.

3962
01:37:29,210 --> 01:37:29,560
Right.

3963
01:37:29,560 --> 01:37:32,530
It gets in that like how it just
starts like flickering like it.

3964
01:37:32,750 --> 01:37:34,360
Like it's like a flicker almost.

3965
01:37:34,870 --> 01:37:35,201
Yeah.

3966
01:37:35,201 --> 01:37:36,250
And that's a little baby.

3967
01:37:36,370 --> 01:37:39,790
This little baby I've had
that I've seen one really,

3968
01:37:40,030 --> 01:37:41,230
really close up once.

3969
01:37:41,310 --> 01:37:43,390
I seen one that here
in Calabasas died out.

3970
01:37:43,410 --> 01:37:43,810
Yeah.

3971
01:37:43,810 --> 01:37:45,790
Like a shit what you call a shooting star.

3972
01:37:46,180 --> 01:37:50,220
And there was apparently one that
was filmed in San Francisco as well.

3973
01:37:50,280 --> 01:37:50,970
Yeah.

3974
01:37:50,970 --> 01:37:51,640
Yeah.

3975
01:37:51,640 --> 01:37:53,770
And these have nothing to do with that.

3976
01:37:53,771 --> 01:37:56,200
Other Astra has two really close

3977
01:37:56,200 --> 01:38:00,310
by to 41 or inside the outer ring of Sal.

3978
01:38:00,540 --> 01:38:01,373
It's awesome.

3979
01:38:01,390 --> 01:38:03,250
That's how close this fucking thing is.

3980
01:38:03,850 --> 01:38:05,440
And that one is a motherfucker.

3981
01:38:05,500 --> 01:38:06,460
If that one hits us,

3982
01:38:06,580 --> 01:38:07,450
look at all this damage.

3983
01:38:07,451 --> 01:38:08,150
This thing.

3984
01:38:08,150 --> 01:38:08,350
Yeah.

3985
01:38:08,350 --> 01:38:09,183
That was a big one.

3986
01:38:09,520 --> 01:38:10,021
The one that came.

3987
01:38:10,021 --> 01:38:10,900
This was crazy.

3988
01:38:10,901 --> 01:38:11,651
Just how it looks.

3989
01:38:11,651 --> 01:38:13,090
It looks like almost like a filter,

3990
01:38:13,300 --> 01:38:13,630
right?

3991
01:38:13,630 --> 01:38:14,463
Instagram.

3992
01:38:14,480 --> 01:38:14,780
Yeah,

3993
01:38:14,780 --> 01:38:15,460
look at that.

3994
01:38:15,460 --> 01:38:17,440
It just brightens the whole thing.

3995
01:38:17,770 --> 01:38:19,990
It's amazing that everybody
likes swerved off the road.

3996
01:38:20,020 --> 01:38:20,441
Everybody's like,

3997
01:38:20,441 --> 01:38:21,274
dude to do.

3998
01:38:21,540 --> 01:38:21,701
Yeah.

3999
01:38:21,701 --> 01:38:24,490
There's a good compilation
at live leak right now.

4000
01:38:24,500 --> 01:38:26,410
It has all of them in one long video.

4001
01:38:27,160 --> 01:38:27,551
Yeah.

4002
01:38:27,551 --> 01:38:29,950
This is strange times where
we get to document this.

4003
01:38:30,490 --> 01:38:31,180
I know.

4004
01:38:31,180 --> 01:38:32,590
Whereas before if this happened,

4005
01:38:32,591 --> 01:38:33,720
it would just be mean.

4006
01:38:33,730 --> 01:38:34,600
We wouldn't even hear it.

4007
01:38:34,620 --> 01:38:35,140
Oh,

4008
01:38:35,140 --> 01:38:36,010
a thing about it.

4009
01:38:36,011 --> 01:38:36,580
Yeah.

4010
01:38:36,580 --> 01:38:40,480
We would have no idea that this even
happened in Russia just 10 years ago.

4011
01:38:40,760 --> 01:38:40,941
Yeah.

4012
01:38:40,941 --> 01:38:43,880
And I think that actually really
does contribute to the paranoia.

4013
01:38:44,030 --> 01:38:44,540
Sure.

4014
01:38:44,540 --> 01:38:48,980
Cause like you've seen the footage
now of the tsunami and Fukushima,

4015
01:38:48,981 --> 01:38:50,120
like you can't,

4016
01:38:50,150 --> 01:38:51,290
you can't get away from it.

4017
01:38:51,291 --> 01:38:51,621
You know,

4018
01:38:51,621 --> 01:38:51,901
and the,

4019
01:38:51,901 --> 01:38:55,400
and the nine 11 you've seen that
come down a million times and this,

4020
01:38:55,430 --> 01:38:55,851
it's just,

4021
01:38:55,851 --> 01:38:56,540
it's,

4022
01:38:56,540 --> 01:38:57,373
it makes you,

4023
01:38:57,950 --> 01:39:00,270
it's like you'd like to think
you're sophisticated and,

4024
01:39:00,290 --> 01:39:02,990
and that you don't believe in advertising
and that that shit doesn't affect you.

4025
01:39:02,991 --> 01:39:05,240
But the truth is like you're very simple.

4026
01:39:05,360 --> 01:39:07,680
You're an animal and
that shit works on you.

4027
01:39:07,720 --> 01:39:08,540
You know,

4028
01:39:08,540 --> 01:39:09,410
and you believe that

4029
01:39:09,510 --> 01:39:10,820
life is a Sandra Bullock movie.

4030
01:39:13,080 --> 01:39:13,890
Meanwhile,

4031
01:39:13,890 --> 01:39:14,431
Sandra Bullock,

4032
01:39:14,431 --> 01:39:14,731
he'd be like,

4033
01:39:14,731 --> 01:39:18,690
she's great rocks come from the
fucking sky and drop on things.

4034
01:39:19,710 --> 01:39:20,580
Ooh,

4035
01:39:20,640 --> 01:39:21,241
there was,

4036
01:39:21,241 --> 01:39:21,750
um,

4037
01:39:21,750 --> 01:39:22,480
there's a,

4038
01:39:22,480 --> 01:39:22,800
uh,

4039
01:39:22,800 --> 01:39:24,540
an area,

4040
01:39:24,600 --> 01:39:25,080
um,

4041
01:39:25,080 --> 01:39:28,890
in time about 13,000 years ago that I'm
fascinated by because I've been reading

4042
01:39:28,891 --> 01:39:31,110
all this stuff about this,

4043
01:39:31,111 --> 01:39:31,800
what it looks like,

4044
01:39:31,800 --> 01:39:32,820
nuclear class,

4045
01:39:32,821 --> 01:39:36,050
this green glass they found all over the,

4046
01:39:36,051 --> 01:39:36,310
uh,

4047
01:39:36,310 --> 01:39:41,310
the earth and about 13,000 years and
they think it was a series of meteor

4048
01:39:41,521 --> 01:39:43,680
impacts about 13,000 years ago,

4049
01:39:43,740 --> 01:39:44,670
all over the globe.

4050
01:39:44,690 --> 01:39:45,020
Oh Wow.

4051
01:39:45,020 --> 01:39:45,990
They found this stuff.

4052
01:39:46,080 --> 01:39:47,220
It's really cool.

4053
01:39:47,221 --> 01:39:49,800
They've found like big people
were around for that stuff.

4054
01:39:49,801 --> 01:39:51,540
And there's oral history.

4055
01:39:51,570 --> 01:39:52,410
Oh yeah.

4056
01:39:52,411 --> 01:39:53,001
Well that's,

4057
01:39:53,001 --> 01:39:54,930
that's what they think is,

4058
01:39:55,050 --> 01:39:55,411
you know,

4059
01:39:55,411 --> 01:39:55,651
the,

4060
01:39:55,651 --> 01:39:55,950
the,

4061
01:39:55,950 --> 01:40:00,950
the ancient history theorists that
follow sort of an alternative timeline.

4062
01:40:01,070 --> 01:40:01,290
Right.

4063
01:40:01,290 --> 01:40:06,060
I believe that there's been some rises
and falls and that accounts for Atlanta

4064
01:40:06,230 --> 01:40:07,170
and a lot of different,

4065
01:40:07,200 --> 01:40:08,010
well the men

4066
01:40:08,010 --> 01:40:09,150
dry and then you know,

4067
01:40:09,151 --> 01:40:12,210
that broken the Atlantic
went in and flooded it.

4068
01:40:13,210 --> 01:40:13,301
Well,

4069
01:40:13,301 --> 01:40:13,871
there's a bunch of,

4070
01:40:13,871 --> 01:40:16,830
I mean I'm sure there's been a
series of cataclysmic disasters,

4071
01:40:16,870 --> 01:40:21,870
but they're just coming to terms now with
this proliferation of this green glass

4072
01:40:22,121 --> 01:40:24,970
all over the earth at
about 13,000 years ago.

4073
01:40:24,971 --> 01:40:28,630
So it was enough to kill a lot of
fucking people wipe out a lot of shit,

4074
01:40:28,840 --> 01:40:30,420
but not enough to kill everybody and,

4075
01:40:30,421 --> 01:40:34,270
and burn it into the collective
unconscious of this can happen.

4076
01:40:34,300 --> 01:40:34,901
But this,

4077
01:40:34,901 --> 01:40:36,460
these impacts that we saw a hertz,

4078
01:40:36,461 --> 01:40:37,300
400 people,

4079
01:40:37,301 --> 01:40:40,180
they didn't leave behind any of
this green shit as far as I know.

4080
01:40:40,530 --> 01:40:40,990
Yeah.

4081
01:40:40,990 --> 01:40:41,410
It depends on,

4082
01:40:41,410 --> 01:40:41,611
I mean,

4083
01:40:41,611 --> 01:40:42,410
there's probably much bigger,

4084
01:40:42,410 --> 01:40:43,310
what you're talking about,

4085
01:40:43,850 --> 01:40:46,910
this stuff was the same stuff that is,

4086
01:40:46,911 --> 01:40:47,230
um,

4087
01:40:47,230 --> 01:40:49,300
created when you have nuclear tests.

4088
01:40:49,510 --> 01:40:49,661
Oh,

4089
01:40:49,661 --> 01:40:49,841
right.

4090
01:40:49,841 --> 01:40:50,491
It's sort of green.

4091
01:40:50,491 --> 01:40:51,300
Super Glad,

4092
01:40:51,300 --> 01:40:51,940
right?

4093
01:40:51,940 --> 01:40:52,600
Yeah.

4094
01:40:52,600 --> 01:40:54,250
We're rock is just bull

4095
01:40:54,250 --> 01:40:56,470
asked to buy this impossible force,

4096
01:40:56,710 --> 01:40:59,870
but apparently it's all
over the world at 13,000 or

4097
01:41:01,420 --> 01:41:02,350
something.

4098
01:41:02,351 --> 01:41:05,570
Fucked us sideways just and it,

4099
01:41:05,620 --> 01:41:08,290
it also coincides with
the end of the ice age.

4100
01:41:08,350 --> 01:41:09,040
Right.

4101
01:41:09,040 --> 01:41:09,920
Which it might've been.

4102
01:41:09,950 --> 01:41:11,830
That might've changed the climate.

4103
01:41:11,860 --> 01:41:12,510
Sure,

4104
01:41:12,510 --> 01:41:12,880
sure.

4105
01:41:12,880 --> 01:41:14,200
It's really some crazy shit.

4106
01:41:14,230 --> 01:41:14,381
Well,

4107
01:41:14,381 --> 01:41:14,621
yeah,

4108
01:41:14,621 --> 01:41:15,850
we wouldn't be surprised at all.

4109
01:41:15,920 --> 01:41:16,240
Yeah.

4110
01:41:16,240 --> 01:41:18,790
They also think that it might have
something to do with some of the mass

4111
01:41:18,791 --> 01:41:20,530
extinctions that went on during that time.

4112
01:41:20,800 --> 01:41:24,290
There's a lot of confusion as to like
what happens to the wooly mammoths and you

4113
01:41:24,300 --> 01:41:26,710
have to think anymore men
hunted them out or you know.

4114
01:41:26,920 --> 01:41:27,220
Yeah.

4115
01:41:27,220 --> 01:41:27,791
But I've heard that,

4116
01:41:27,791 --> 01:41:28,900
that there's a lot of people that say,

4117
01:41:28,901 --> 01:41:31,460
well that's crazy what you're talking
about guys with spears and they're,

4118
01:41:31,470 --> 01:41:32,390
they're hunting out there.

4119
01:41:32,391 --> 01:41:32,711
They're going to,

4120
01:41:32,711 --> 01:41:34,450
you're going to wipe
out these motherfuckers.

4121
01:41:34,451 --> 01:41:34,890
Really?

4122
01:41:34,890 --> 01:41:35,630
Yeah,

4123
01:41:35,630 --> 01:41:36,463
I know.

4124
01:41:37,110 --> 01:41:37,420
I don't know.

4125
01:41:37,420 --> 01:41:37,860
I'm not,

4126
01:41:37,860 --> 01:41:38,080
yeah,

4127
01:41:38,080 --> 01:41:38,500
I dunno.

4128
01:41:38,500 --> 01:41:38,890
I'm pointing to,

4129
01:41:38,890 --> 01:41:39,050
right.

4130
01:41:39,050 --> 01:41:41,800
I've heard asteroids of her other things,

4131
01:41:41,830 --> 01:41:46,720
but it's weird to think that
this society we have now,

4132
01:41:46,721 --> 01:41:51,250
which seems so permanently here we are
place talking through wires that are

4133
01:41:51,251 --> 01:41:52,630
connected to the Internet,

4134
01:41:52,631 --> 01:41:57,010
whatever the fuck that is and sends
this audio file out to a million people.

4135
01:41:57,011 --> 01:42:00,760
But the think that this could
all go away and you trap,

4136
01:42:00,780 --> 01:42:02,170
it's an hack rats with rocks.

4137
01:42:02,171 --> 01:42:02,471
Yeah,

4138
01:42:02,471 --> 01:42:02,690
no,

4139
01:42:02,690 --> 01:42:03,041
it's,

4140
01:42:03,041 --> 01:42:03,311
it's,

4141
01:42:03,311 --> 01:42:04,720
it's sort of funny because you never,

4142
01:42:04,900 --> 01:42:07,420
you don't think it's going to happen
and you don't think it's possible.

4143
01:42:07,421 --> 01:42:08,254
It's like a,

4144
01:42:08,320 --> 01:42:10,640
it's a little bit like being on the
freeway where you don't think an accident.

4145
01:42:10,660 --> 01:42:12,040
It's impossible.

4146
01:42:12,041 --> 01:42:15,070
Like it sort of feels like it
can never happen and you know,

4147
01:42:15,071 --> 01:42:16,570
and then shit happens.

4148
01:42:16,571 --> 01:42:16,771
And,

4149
01:42:16,771 --> 01:42:17,604
and uh,

4150
01:42:17,670 --> 01:42:18,090
it's,

4151
01:42:18,090 --> 01:42:18,611
it's like a,

4152
01:42:18,611 --> 01:42:18,941
you know,

4153
01:42:18,941 --> 01:42:19,601
in California,

4154
01:42:19,601 --> 01:42:21,970
earthquake insurance gets,

4155
01:42:21,971 --> 01:42:22,211
you know,

4156
01:42:22,211 --> 01:42:25,480
it's expensive right after the earthquake
and then it gets cheaper and cheaper

4157
01:42:25,481 --> 01:42:26,730
and cheaper because it,

4158
01:42:27,010 --> 01:42:28,870
but actually the danger is going up,

4159
01:42:29,290 --> 01:42:29,800
right.

4160
01:42:29,800 --> 01:42:30,491
The risk is,

4161
01:42:30,491 --> 01:42:30,821
you know,

4162
01:42:30,821 --> 01:42:31,081
but,

4163
01:42:31,081 --> 01:42:32,050
but if people are buying it,

4164
01:42:32,051 --> 01:42:32,620
you forget,

4165
01:42:32,620 --> 01:42:32,891
you know?

4166
01:42:32,891 --> 01:42:33,101
Yeah.

4167
01:42:33,101 --> 01:42:34,590
People aren't buying it and it's,

4168
01:42:34,660 --> 01:42:34,961
it's,

4169
01:42:34,961 --> 01:42:35,280
uh,

4170
01:42:35,280 --> 01:42:36,101
this is human nature.

4171
01:42:36,101 --> 01:42:37,570
We're were simpler.

4172
01:42:38,130 --> 01:42:38,620
There's like,

4173
01:42:38,620 --> 01:42:38,861
you know,

4174
01:42:38,861 --> 01:42:40,840
it's a myth that man is a rational actor.

4175
01:42:40,841 --> 01:42:43,180
You're an emotional actor
and you rationalize it.

4176
01:42:43,210 --> 01:42:43,450
You know,

4177
01:42:43,450 --> 01:42:44,350
like we're trying,

4178
01:42:44,650 --> 01:42:49,240
we're trying to figure out how to
rationally quantify bounded rationality in

4179
01:42:49,241 --> 01:42:50,100
humans too.

4180
01:42:50,130 --> 01:42:50,600
Yeah,

4181
01:42:50,600 --> 01:42:50,801
no,

4182
01:42:50,801 --> 01:42:51,340
totally.

4183
01:42:51,340 --> 01:42:55,000
The idea that we have access to the
events that take place in the lives of

4184
01:42:55,001 --> 01:42:55,900
billions of people.

4185
01:42:55,901 --> 01:42:56,830
It's just too nutty.

4186
01:42:57,220 --> 01:42:58,020
It's like,

4187
01:42:58,020 --> 01:43:01,420
how are we supposed to pay attention
to all these different events,

4188
01:43:01,600 --> 01:43:06,600
animal attacks and meteors and sharks
and fucking all this shit is happening

4189
01:43:07,391 --> 01:43:11,590
because you're dealing with an insane
number of human beings and insane number

4190
01:43:11,591 --> 01:43:12,330
of lives.

4191
01:43:12,330 --> 01:43:12,660
Totally.

4192
01:43:12,660 --> 01:43:14,500
So if you look at life,

4193
01:43:14,530 --> 01:43:18,130
I mean I think we're probably
way safer than ever before,

4194
01:43:18,350 --> 01:43:20,890
but we're also way more fucking paranoid.

4195
01:43:20,980 --> 01:43:21,401
Yes.

4196
01:43:21,401 --> 01:43:24,970
We're taking into account shit that's
happening to people that are impossibly

4197
01:43:24,971 --> 01:43:25,610
far away.

4198
01:43:25,610 --> 01:43:25,920
Yeah,

4199
01:43:25,920 --> 01:43:26,800
exactly.

4200
01:43:27,170 --> 01:43:28,600
They actually agree 100% and you know,

4201
01:43:28,601 --> 01:43:28,791
it's,

4202
01:43:28,791 --> 01:43:30,560
it's all one of the safest times to be.

4203
01:43:30,561 --> 01:43:33,370
It's certainly be American
live here in the first world.

4204
01:43:33,880 --> 01:43:34,713
And yet,

4205
01:43:34,960 --> 01:43:35,440
you know,

4206
01:43:35,440 --> 01:43:36,460
reporting,

4207
01:43:36,520 --> 01:43:37,960
being human nature,

4208
01:43:38,230 --> 01:43:42,430
we're drawn to scary stories and
we're drawn to the shark attack.

4209
01:43:42,460 --> 01:43:43,150
Even though you know,

4210
01:43:43,150 --> 01:43:46,860
you're much more look to get fat
and die of diabetes that you know,

4211
01:43:46,870 --> 01:43:48,730
that's what's going to
get you a car accident.

4212
01:43:49,360 --> 01:43:50,870
But you're worried about sharks.

4213
01:43:50,940 --> 01:43:51,080
Well,

4214
01:43:51,080 --> 01:43:53,120
I think our biggest fear today,

4215
01:43:53,121 --> 01:43:55,880
the most likely fear is human sabotage.

4216
01:43:56,200 --> 01:43:57,950
And what by by human sabotage,

4217
01:43:57,951 --> 01:44:02,951
I mean like man created issues
like car accidents or drugs or,

4218
01:44:03,890 --> 01:44:04,250
or,

4219
01:44:04,250 --> 01:44:04,670
or,

4220
01:44:04,670 --> 01:44:05,180
you know,

4221
01:44:05,180 --> 01:44:06,770
things along those lines.

4222
01:44:06,771 --> 01:44:07,400
Like,

4223
01:44:07,400 --> 01:44:11,510
do you know how many fucking people that
I've talked to who have kids that are

4224
01:44:11,511 --> 01:44:12,500
hooked on pills?

4225
01:44:12,840 --> 01:44:13,040
Right?

4226
01:44:13,040 --> 01:44:17,530
I mean apparently in high schools today
it is a big shuttle in is like drug

4227
01:44:17,590 --> 01:44:17,910
dealing.

4228
01:44:17,910 --> 01:44:20,990
Ritalin is like a whole
and Adderall is a big one.

4229
01:44:21,380 --> 01:44:22,840
Oxycontin's are big.

4230
01:44:22,910 --> 01:44:25,070
I heard about a lot of writers use it.

4231
01:44:25,250 --> 01:44:25,551
Yeah.

4232
01:44:25,551 --> 01:44:28,520
Adderall to write their stuff
like screenplays and stuff.

4233
01:44:28,521 --> 01:44:31,520
I hear the screenwriters to it
and here's the danger to that,

4234
01:44:31,521 --> 01:44:34,550
which I think my ex lane what's happening.

4235
01:44:34,551 --> 01:44:36,010
But there's um,

4236
01:44:36,530 --> 01:44:39,740
Jonah Lehrer wrote that book
called imagine about how
innovation works and he's

4237
01:44:39,741 --> 01:44:39,980
been,

4238
01:44:39,980 --> 01:44:40,161
you know,

4239
01:44:40,161 --> 01:44:42,860
he's the guy who got discredited
cause he made up Bob Dylan quotes.

4240
01:44:43,010 --> 01:44:43,400
He did.

4241
01:44:43,400 --> 01:44:44,530
Oh yeah,

4242
01:44:44,660 --> 01:44:45,740
I heard about that totally.

4243
01:44:45,741 --> 01:44:46,574
Yet he got,

4244
01:44:46,880 --> 01:44:50,270
but the book is actually not bad and
that it was too bad that he do that.

4245
01:44:50,330 --> 01:44:51,290
It's not even interesting.

4246
01:44:51,291 --> 01:44:51,441
Like,

4247
01:44:51,441 --> 01:44:52,790
it's not even the good part of the book.

4248
01:44:52,791 --> 01:44:53,400
I don't know what,

4249
01:44:53,400 --> 01:44:54,050
what happened?

4250
01:44:54,050 --> 01:44:55,550
I think he's pretty arrogant dude.

4251
01:44:56,060 --> 01:44:56,960
But the um,

4252
01:44:57,860 --> 01:44:58,161
the,

4253
01:44:58,161 --> 01:44:58,401
the,

4254
01:44:58,401 --> 01:44:58,871
the,

4255
01:44:58,871 --> 01:45:02,870
the thing about innovation is it
like caffeine hurts her innovation.

4256
01:45:03,410 --> 01:45:04,800
Adderall hurts your innovation.

4257
01:45:04,801 --> 01:45:05,930
Like it helps you focus,

4258
01:45:06,230 --> 01:45:09,500
but you innovation needs
to be broad with your mind.

4259
01:45:09,501 --> 01:45:10,940
That's why it happens in the shower.

4260
01:45:11,120 --> 01:45:14,600
That's what happens in your own
walks or you're kind of spacing out.

4261
01:45:14,630 --> 01:45:14,880
You got,

4262
01:45:14,880 --> 01:45:16,310
and you made me tired sometimes.

4263
01:45:16,311 --> 01:45:16,371
Yeah.

4264
01:45:16,371 --> 01:45:17,660
Your brain makes a connection.

4265
01:45:17,661 --> 01:45:18,920
It wouldn't have made otherwise.

4266
01:45:19,160 --> 01:45:22,850
It's reaching through your all
your experience and it's going,

4267
01:45:22,880 --> 01:45:25,040
oh look at this would have
worked if you just thought of it.

4268
01:45:25,041 --> 01:45:26,990
But you can't when you're
on Adderall and cat,

4269
01:45:27,020 --> 01:45:27,950
even caffeine,

4270
01:45:28,370 --> 01:45:31,070
you can't do that because
you're focusing focusing.

4271
01:45:31,130 --> 01:45:31,551
Right.

4272
01:45:31,551 --> 01:45:33,740
That's why coke people
are so hard to talk to.

4273
01:45:34,160 --> 01:45:34,760
Yeah.

4274
01:45:34,760 --> 01:45:35,031
Certainly.

4275
01:45:35,031 --> 01:45:37,820
Specific Coke people and
some people they don't,

4276
01:45:37,970 --> 01:45:41,150
they're not like abstract
or fascinating at all.

4277
01:45:41,150 --> 01:45:45,620
They're just real linear and obvious and
repetitive and boring and you're like,

4278
01:45:45,650 --> 01:45:46,071
Oh man,

4279
01:45:46,071 --> 01:45:46,904
get me out of this.

4280
01:45:47,280 --> 01:45:47,450
Well,

4281
01:45:47,450 --> 01:45:49,060
some people I do find with coke,

4282
01:45:49,070 --> 01:45:52,190
like they feel like they're the king of
the world and that's the people that you

4283
01:45:52,191 --> 01:45:53,010
have to watch out.

4284
01:45:53,010 --> 01:45:58,010
And Caffeine can also have that
same sort of euphoric chatterbox.

4285
01:45:58,330 --> 01:45:59,163
It's why I love it.

4286
01:45:59,180 --> 01:45:59,421
Yeah.

4287
01:45:59,421 --> 01:46:00,081
I love coffee,

4288
01:46:00,081 --> 01:46:00,800
caffeine.

4289
01:46:00,800 --> 01:46:02,930
But I think that as far
as like stimulants go,

4290
01:46:03,140 --> 01:46:04,700
that's probably as far
as I'm going to push it.

4291
01:46:04,701 --> 01:46:08,790
I've dabbled with the idea of
trying Adderall but never jumped in.

4292
01:46:08,791 --> 01:46:11,510
And it just seems to me
be a little fucking iffy.

4293
01:46:11,690 --> 01:46:11,901
Well,

4294
01:46:11,901 --> 01:46:12,660
I heard about these guys,

4295
01:46:12,660 --> 01:46:12,891
I'm like,

4296
01:46:12,891 --> 01:46:13,760
well that sounds great.

4297
01:46:13,761 --> 01:46:14,960
And then I read this and I'm like,

4298
01:46:14,990 --> 01:46:15,291
Oh yeah,

4299
01:46:15,291 --> 01:46:16,124
you can't do that.

4300
01:46:16,220 --> 01:46:16,401
You know,

4301
01:46:16,401 --> 01:46:16,800
like it's,

4302
01:46:16,800 --> 01:46:17,631
it's like the monkeys,

4303
01:46:17,631 --> 01:46:17,871
Paul,

4304
01:46:17,871 --> 01:46:18,160
right?

4305
01:46:18,160 --> 01:46:18,750
Like there's a,

4306
01:46:18,750 --> 01:46:21,140
there's a price you pay for the thing.

4307
01:46:21,290 --> 01:46:23,510
Tim Ferriss calls it the
biological free lunch.

4308
01:46:23,511 --> 01:46:25,250
She says there's no
biological on free lunch.

4309
01:46:25,251 --> 01:46:27,920
Whenever you have something that
has like a very powerful action,

4310
01:46:28,200 --> 01:46:30,530
there's going to be an equal reaction.

4311
01:46:30,531 --> 01:46:31,040
Yeah.

4312
01:46:31,040 --> 01:46:32,840
And what he was talking about was,

4313
01:46:32,841 --> 01:46:33,650
um,

4314
01:46:33,650 --> 01:46:34,483
um,

4315
01:46:34,670 --> 01:46:36,130
a think called provigil.

4316
01:46:36,300 --> 01:46:37,280
Have you heard a provisional?

4317
01:46:37,300 --> 01:46:37,940
Yes,

4318
01:46:37,940 --> 01:46:38,773
but tell me what it is.

4319
01:46:38,950 --> 01:46:39,471
I've heard of it,

4320
01:46:39,471 --> 01:46:44,471
but tell me it's a smart drug that a lot
of the sort of a silicon valley dudes

4321
01:46:45,800 --> 01:46:50,430
apparently are on because it's doesn't
seem to have a discernible side effect

4322
01:46:50,850 --> 01:46:51,870
for some folks.

4323
01:46:51,900 --> 01:46:55,470
Some people get rashes and some people
biologically it doesn't jive for them.

4324
01:46:55,650 --> 01:46:56,890
But for other folks it's like,

4325
01:46:57,120 --> 01:46:57,930
it's like martyr,

4326
01:46:57,930 --> 01:46:58,830
it's fucking super pill.

4327
01:46:58,870 --> 01:46:59,200
Right.

4328
01:46:59,200 --> 01:46:59,660
Super Cool.

4329
01:46:59,660 --> 01:47:00,420
It makes you like,

4330
01:47:00,420 --> 01:47:01,830
like super energize.

4331
01:47:01,831 --> 01:47:04,050
Your mind works really
clear but it's not speed,

4332
01:47:04,680 --> 01:47:07,110
but it's real sketchy.

4333
01:47:07,111 --> 01:47:07,831
Like Whoa,

4334
01:47:07,831 --> 01:47:09,120
why did we price?

4335
01:47:09,210 --> 01:47:09,391
Yeah,

4336
01:47:09,391 --> 01:47:11,220
I've done it a couple of times
and every time I do and I'm like,

4337
01:47:11,221 --> 01:47:11,491
man,

4338
01:47:11,491 --> 01:47:13,140
what is going on with this stuff?

4339
01:47:13,790 --> 01:47:15,870
It's fucking super strong man.

4340
01:47:15,871 --> 01:47:16,290
Really?

4341
01:47:16,290 --> 01:47:16,720
Yeah,

4342
01:47:16,720 --> 01:47:18,120
it's really powerful.

4343
01:47:18,300 --> 01:47:21,300
Like I took a half a pill and
it lasts for like six hours.

4344
01:47:21,590 --> 01:47:23,730
And your aunt did a weird way to,

4345
01:47:23,731 --> 01:47:28,500
cause you're not amped like a a guy
like you talked too jacked up on coffee.

4346
01:47:28,501 --> 01:47:28,651
Yeah.

4347
01:47:28,651 --> 01:47:30,570
It's great if you have to drive,

4348
01:47:30,800 --> 01:47:32,380
if you have to drive like I,

4349
01:47:32,381 --> 01:47:33,810
I won't hesitate to take it.

4350
01:47:33,811 --> 01:47:35,670
If I'm in a four hour drive and you know,

4351
01:47:35,790 --> 01:47:38,880
I'm worried about sleeping at the wheel
because you will not sleep at the wheel

4352
01:47:38,881 --> 01:47:40,130
if you take this stuff right,

4353
01:47:40,290 --> 01:47:42,210
if it jives with your biology.

4354
01:47:42,860 --> 01:47:43,710
But it's a tricky one.

4355
01:47:43,711 --> 01:47:45,540
Like a lot of people that
doesn't jive with their biology.

4356
01:47:47,760 --> 01:47:48,420
I wanted to get out,

4357
01:47:48,420 --> 01:47:50,130
I want to get a
prescription for it so bad.

4358
01:47:50,131 --> 01:47:53,250
It's just because I have to do so many
times where I'm just really tired.

4359
01:47:53,450 --> 01:47:53,810
You know,

4360
01:47:53,810 --> 01:47:57,210
I'm working these studs the Lord too.

4361
01:47:57,250 --> 01:47:58,490
Even from coke like you're like,

4362
01:47:58,530 --> 01:47:58,621
ah,

4363
01:47:58,621 --> 01:47:58,991
this part,

4364
01:47:58,991 --> 01:48:00,240
it would be fun if I was awake.

4365
01:48:00,350 --> 01:48:02,010
Have you ever tried Kat?

4366
01:48:02,100 --> 01:48:06,060
Do you know what that stuff that's
stimulant that those Somali pirates trying

4367
01:48:07,560 --> 01:48:08,840
Somali pirates are doing it.

4368
01:48:08,841 --> 01:48:10,490
I'm doing me,

4369
01:48:11,340 --> 01:48:12,810
they seem like rational fellows.

4370
01:48:12,811 --> 01:48:13,410
Good idea.

4371
01:48:13,410 --> 01:48:14,460
Good grip on reality.

4372
01:48:15,140 --> 01:48:17,160
It's going to work out
and I like their shoes.

4373
01:48:17,520 --> 01:48:17,821
Yeah,

4374
01:48:17,821 --> 01:48:19,380
the Somali pirates a,

4375
01:48:19,381 --> 01:48:20,700
that's one of the things that they,

4376
01:48:20,701 --> 01:48:21,090
uh,

4377
01:48:21,090 --> 01:48:25,560
the issue is that they're jacked
up on this and fit amine plant.

4378
01:48:25,590 --> 01:48:25,801
Right.

4379
01:48:25,801 --> 01:48:27,360
This is African amphetamines,

4380
01:48:28,590 --> 01:48:29,080
Africa,

4381
01:48:29,080 --> 01:48:29,611
where it was like,

4382
01:48:29,611 --> 01:48:30,990
this red is going around then you know,

4383
01:48:30,991 --> 01:48:31,920
like he,

4384
01:48:31,921 --> 01:48:32,830
I like sheep.

4385
01:48:32,850 --> 01:48:33,980
It's real cheap and South Africa,

4386
01:48:33,981 --> 01:48:34,814
the life course.

4387
01:48:35,270 --> 01:48:36,103
So it was life.

4388
01:48:36,510 --> 01:48:37,390
Right.

4389
01:48:37,900 --> 01:48:39,540
You hear about that guy
with no legs are shot.

4390
01:48:39,541 --> 01:48:40,140
His girlfriend,

4391
01:48:40,140 --> 01:48:41,760
his story is South African Guy,

4392
01:48:41,910 --> 01:48:42,743
the sprinter,

4393
01:48:42,950 --> 01:48:43,790
the Olympic sprinter.

4394
01:48:43,830 --> 01:48:44,400
I love his name,

4395
01:48:44,400 --> 01:48:44,861
his story.

4396
01:48:44,861 --> 01:48:46,470
It's because it's like the most Afrikaans,

4397
01:48:46,471 --> 01:48:49,470
like Dutch name Pastorius
and he's from notorious,

4398
01:48:49,560 --> 01:48:49,681
oh,

4399
01:48:49,681 --> 01:48:50,514
that's funny.

4400
01:48:50,900 --> 01:48:54,690
It many a apparently constantly
he thought it was she,

4401
01:48:54,730 --> 01:48:58,050
they thought he mistook
her for a burglar at first,

4402
01:48:58,051 --> 01:48:59,150
but then they realize no,

4403
01:48:59,380 --> 01:48:59,561
no,

4404
01:48:59,561 --> 01:49:01,970
he just fucking wigged
out and shut us out.

4405
01:49:01,971 --> 01:49:02,730
South Africa.

4406
01:49:02,730 --> 01:49:03,030
No,

4407
01:49:03,030 --> 01:49:03,600
never.

4408
01:49:03,600 --> 01:49:04,370
I was in,

4409
01:49:04,370 --> 01:49:08,910
so I sailed across the Indian Ocean and
then I quit this job and I got off in

4410
01:49:08,911 --> 01:49:09,744
South Africa,

4411
01:49:10,080 --> 01:49:10,913
Australia.

4412
01:49:11,070 --> 01:49:12,690
What was after I'd been
living in Thailand,

4413
01:49:12,691 --> 01:49:12,990
right.

4414
01:49:12,990 --> 01:49:14,470
And fighting and I went back to Australia.

4415
01:49:14,471 --> 01:49:15,091
I got on a boat.

4416
01:49:15,091 --> 01:49:15,924
What to uh,

4417
01:49:15,960 --> 01:49:16,880
across the Indian Ocean,

4418
01:49:16,900 --> 01:49:18,420
doing what is working,

4419
01:49:19,170 --> 01:49:19,920
what kind of job.

4420
01:49:19,920 --> 01:49:20,890
But it was it a mate,

4421
01:49:21,100 --> 01:49:24,840
a friend of mine was taking his
little 38 foot Hans Christian with his

4422
01:49:24,930 --> 01:49:26,190
girlfriend who was a friend of mine.

4423
01:49:26,240 --> 01:49:26,540
Uh,

4424
01:49:26,540 --> 01:49:29,610
so it was the three of us
for five months across God.

4425
01:49:29,790 --> 01:49:31,830
But one of the things you never really
seen when you're saying them like that,

4426
01:49:31,831 --> 01:49:33,900
you don't really see anybody
because you're sleeping.

4427
01:49:33,930 --> 01:49:35,760
He's up and then he's sleeping Europe.

4428
01:49:35,790 --> 01:49:36,271
You know what I mean?

4429
01:49:36,271 --> 01:49:40,140
It's not like you're put the three of
you were on a boat for five months.

4430
01:49:40,170 --> 01:49:41,003
Yeah,

4431
01:49:41,140 --> 01:49:41,470
yeah.

4432
01:49:41,470 --> 01:49:42,303
Oh my God.

4433
01:49:42,750 --> 01:49:43,231
Five months.

4434
01:49:43,231 --> 01:49:44,760
Just you were the only people you saw?

4435
01:49:44,800 --> 01:49:44,881
No,

4436
01:49:44,881 --> 01:49:45,330
no.

4437
01:49:45,330 --> 01:49:46,100
We got off a couple.

4438
01:49:46,100 --> 01:49:47,500
We had stopped like three or four times.

4439
01:49:47,530 --> 01:49:47,830
Right.

4440
01:49:47,830 --> 01:49:47,980
So

4441
01:49:47,980 --> 01:49:50,050
I stopped it like Maricia said reunion.

4442
01:49:50,080 --> 01:49:54,280
So you may go a month with all 20 days,

4443
01:49:54,281 --> 01:49:55,114
something like that.

4444
01:49:55,120 --> 01:49:57,100
What did you eat with food?

4445
01:49:57,280 --> 01:49:58,113
We brought food,

4446
01:49:58,300 --> 01:49:59,710
tons of canned food and gets fish.

4447
01:49:59,740 --> 01:50:00,011
But yeah,

4448
01:50:00,011 --> 01:50:04,150
tons of canned food and stuff
and rice and whatever water.

4449
01:50:04,770 --> 01:50:05,120
Uh,

4450
01:50:05,120 --> 01:50:05,190
yeah,

4451
01:50:05,190 --> 01:50:05,740
it was fun.

4452
01:50:05,740 --> 01:50:06,610
And you couldn't handle it though.

4453
01:50:06,611 --> 01:50:08,200
When you went to got to South Carolina,

4454
01:50:08,360 --> 01:50:09,820
I was ready to get the fuck out of there.

4455
01:50:10,150 --> 01:50:14,470
So we hit Durban and I quit and
I bummed around South Africa for,

4456
01:50:14,920 --> 01:50:15,360
I don't know,

4457
01:50:15,360 --> 01:50:16,170
maybe six months,

4458
01:50:16,170 --> 01:50:17,890
tease us dude.

4459
01:50:17,980 --> 01:50:19,240
And here Trey,

4460
01:50:19,310 --> 01:50:20,143
Indiana.

4461
01:50:21,220 --> 01:50:21,610
Yeah.

4462
01:50:21,610 --> 01:50:24,310
You're always going to places that
you could die real easy from bugs.

4463
01:50:24,420 --> 01:50:25,253
Right.

4464
01:50:25,660 --> 01:50:26,230
Where was I?

4465
01:50:26,230 --> 01:50:30,610
What was that story and the story
from people being separated?

4466
01:50:30,640 --> 01:50:32,240
Oh no it how dangerous South Africa.

4467
01:50:32,241 --> 01:50:37,210
It's crazy because like this girl who
became my friend who sort of like adopted

4468
01:50:37,211 --> 01:50:38,470
me for some reason a Durban,

4469
01:50:39,130 --> 01:50:39,610
um,

4470
01:50:39,610 --> 01:50:41,800
she had all these scars because,

4471
01:50:42,490 --> 01:50:42,970
uh,

4472
01:50:42,970 --> 01:50:43,900
she has guard dogs,

4473
01:50:43,901 --> 01:50:44,280
you know,

4474
01:50:44,280 --> 01:50:45,113
cause it's,

4475
01:50:45,160 --> 01:50:45,431
you know,

4476
01:50:45,431 --> 01:50:46,600
it's dangerous place.

4477
01:50:46,620 --> 01:50:51,310
They had guard dogs and the maid came in
the wrong door on the wrong day and the

4478
01:50:51,311 --> 01:50:55,690
dogs killed the Guy Dave made and she
was in there fighting the dogs trying to

4479
01:50:55,691 --> 01:51:00,190
pull in the black made these dogs are
trained to attack black people and she got

4480
01:51:00,310 --> 01:51:03,070
shredded and the dogs killed the maid.

4481
01:51:03,620 --> 01:51:04,300
And that was like,

4482
01:51:04,300 --> 01:51:04,601
oh yeah,

4483
01:51:04,601 --> 01:51:05,231
that's what happened.

4484
01:51:05,231 --> 01:51:05,431
And it,

4485
01:51:05,431 --> 01:51:06,440
it'll night you drive around,

4486
01:51:06,470 --> 01:51:07,330
you run red lights,

4487
01:51:07,331 --> 01:51:08,164
you don't stop.

4488
01:51:08,170 --> 01:51:09,040
Oh my God.

4489
01:51:09,460 --> 01:51:10,940
So he was just worried
about getting caught.

4490
01:51:11,830 --> 01:51:11,981
Yeah.

4491
01:51:11,981 --> 01:51:12,814
You just don't do it.

4492
01:51:12,970 --> 01:51:13,211
Yeah.

4493
01:51:13,211 --> 01:51:15,130
How much more dangerous
or South Africa then?

4494
01:51:15,160 --> 01:51:15,993
Like Detroit,

4495
01:51:16,210 --> 01:51:17,110
um,

4496
01:51:17,430 --> 01:51:18,310
you towards getting there.

4497
01:51:18,311 --> 01:51:19,060
Right.

4498
01:51:19,060 --> 01:51:19,481
I don't know.

4499
01:51:19,481 --> 01:51:23,070
I've met in Detroit and just like decide
the color scale you have for stress was

4500
01:51:23,090 --> 01:51:24,490
like the South Africa scale.

4501
01:51:24,520 --> 01:51:24,671
Yeah.

4502
01:51:24,671 --> 01:51:26,260
I went to a close here to South Africa.

4503
01:51:26,290 --> 01:51:30,370
I went to Panama and Panama City and
then apparently that's like co Cologne.

4504
01:51:30,390 --> 01:51:32,530
It's apparently really
dangerous and it was bad,

4505
01:51:32,531 --> 01:51:33,730
but as long as you kept moving,

4506
01:51:33,731 --> 01:51:34,564
it was all right.

4507
01:51:34,660 --> 01:51:36,040
It was the kind of thing
where if you stayed,

4508
01:51:36,041 --> 01:51:36,910
you would have gotten jumped.

4509
01:51:36,911 --> 01:51:37,744
We uh,

4510
01:51:38,200 --> 01:51:38,711
we had,

4511
01:51:38,711 --> 01:51:38,950
uh,

4512
01:51:38,950 --> 01:51:43,050
one of the guys from a vice on
that said that the Karachi a bad,

4513
01:51:43,090 --> 01:51:44,380
apparently Shane Smith,

4514
01:51:44,381 --> 01:51:46,540
who's the head of Vice Awesome Guy,

4515
01:51:46,541 --> 01:51:47,440
we've had them on a few times.

4516
01:51:47,441 --> 01:51:47,950
I love,

4517
01:51:47,950 --> 01:51:48,611
love that guy.

4518
01:51:48,611 --> 01:51:49,151
He's amazing.

4519
01:51:49,151 --> 01:51:49,931
He's been all over the world.

4520
01:51:49,931 --> 01:51:50,980
But he said Karachi,

4521
01:51:50,981 --> 01:51:51,221
he said,

4522
01:51:51,221 --> 01:51:52,630
your life's worth about 20 bucks,

4523
01:51:52,660 --> 01:51:53,020
right.

4524
01:51:53,020 --> 01:51:53,801
You can hire a hit man.

4525
01:51:53,801 --> 01:51:54,710
To kill you for 20 bucks.

4526
01:51:54,850 --> 01:51:57,190
I can't be on the street.

4527
01:51:57,220 --> 01:51:58,390
Millions of people.

4528
01:51:58,391 --> 01:52:01,330
And they pull up and just shoot
people and just hop on their mind.

4529
01:52:02,410 --> 01:52:03,700
It's in Pakistan,

4530
01:52:04,450 --> 01:52:05,470
Karachi and Pakistan.

4531
01:52:05,770 --> 01:52:06,603
Yeah.

4532
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:07,833
Let me see.

4533
01:52:08,130 --> 01:52:09,970
All rightey Pakistan.

4534
01:52:10,260 --> 01:52:10,451
Yeah.

4535
01:52:10,451 --> 01:52:11,170
I never really did.

4536
01:52:11,170 --> 01:52:11,680
I mean,

4537
01:52:11,680 --> 01:52:12,513
anyway,

4538
01:52:12,980 --> 01:52:13,813
yeah,

4539
01:52:14,040 --> 01:52:14,660
a lot of,

4540
01:52:14,660 --> 01:52:15,220
but you know,

4541
01:52:15,220 --> 01:52:15,610
most,

4542
01:52:15,610 --> 01:52:17,830
a lot of towns in Pakistan,

4543
01:52:17,860 --> 01:52:18,401
in Africa,

4544
01:52:18,401 --> 01:52:18,760
you know,

4545
01:52:18,760 --> 01:52:19,760
after dark,

4546
01:52:19,850 --> 01:52:20,980
dangerous after dark.

4547
01:52:21,660 --> 01:52:25,950
When we look at our life that
we have today in society,

4548
01:52:25,960 --> 01:52:26,261
I mean,

4549
01:52:26,261 --> 01:52:29,080
look at us living here in Los Angeles,

4550
01:52:29,081 --> 01:52:30,310
the greater Los Angeles area.

4551
01:52:30,570 --> 01:52:35,320
It's so Goddamn cushy compared to some
spots in the world and what it used to be

4552
01:52:35,321 --> 01:52:35,591
too.

4553
01:52:35,591 --> 01:52:35,771
Like,

4554
01:52:35,771 --> 01:52:35,970
you know,

4555
01:52:35,970 --> 01:52:36,850
like we're talking about,

4556
01:52:36,851 --> 01:52:37,061
you know,

4557
01:52:37,061 --> 01:52:38,050
what you're come from,

4558
01:52:38,080 --> 01:52:40,930
what you would have been normally
dealing with and it's just,

4559
01:52:41,050 --> 01:52:42,220
you're never hungry.

4560
01:52:42,221 --> 01:52:46,040
You never cold food is five minutes away.

4561
01:52:46,220 --> 01:52:49,640
Like if the apocalypse comes or the
people in the Congo gonna even know.

4562
01:52:49,730 --> 01:52:50,090
Yeah.

4563
01:52:50,090 --> 01:52:50,923
Right,

4564
01:52:50,990 --> 01:52:51,530
right.

4565
01:52:51,530 --> 01:52:53,090
You're going to operate as you.

4566
01:52:53,320 --> 01:52:53,930
Has Anything changed?

4567
01:52:53,930 --> 01:52:54,051
No.

4568
01:52:54,051 --> 01:52:54,651
One I did.

4569
01:52:54,651 --> 01:52:56,960
So at part of the book I
went up to the Inuit up in,

4570
01:52:56,980 --> 01:52:57,230
uh,

4571
01:52:57,230 --> 01:52:58,063
in um,

4572
01:52:58,070 --> 01:52:58,903
northern Canada.

4573
01:52:58,930 --> 01:52:59,763
Oh,

4574
01:53:00,070 --> 01:53:02,390
did the Igloo and the sea
ice and stuff like that.

4575
01:53:02,391 --> 01:53:02,871
And again,

4576
01:53:02,871 --> 01:53:04,250
if the apocalypse comes like,

4577
01:53:04,820 --> 01:53:05,091
yeah,

4578
01:53:05,091 --> 01:53:07,220
they'll notice because they'll be gas,

4579
01:53:07,250 --> 01:53:07,701
you know,

4580
01:53:07,701 --> 01:53:11,030
after a year or two that were on the gas
and they'll be back to their sled dogs,

4581
01:53:11,480 --> 01:53:11,870
you know.

4582
01:53:11,870 --> 01:53:13,040
But other than that,

4583
01:53:13,160 --> 01:53:13,910
they're fine.

4584
01:53:13,910 --> 01:53:15,260
What did you do with the it up then?

4585
01:53:15,680 --> 01:53:16,131
I did,

4586
01:53:16,131 --> 01:53:16,450
um,

4587
01:53:16,450 --> 01:53:19,660
I just bummed around for a couple
of weeks and did old thing,

4588
01:53:20,210 --> 01:53:22,160
go somewhere and fuck off
for a couple of months.

4589
01:53:22,220 --> 01:53:22,431
Well,

4590
01:53:22,431 --> 01:53:23,540
I would've gone on for longer,

4591
01:53:23,541 --> 01:53:24,291
but now I have a kid.

4592
01:53:24,291 --> 01:53:25,011
I don't do it anymore,

4593
01:53:25,011 --> 01:53:25,580
but uh,

4594
01:53:25,580 --> 01:53:26,301
but uh,

4595
01:53:26,301 --> 01:53:26,541
you know,

4596
01:53:26,541 --> 01:53:26,941
I did this,

4597
01:53:26,941 --> 01:53:27,530
see I smell.

4598
01:53:27,530 --> 01:53:29,510
So I did like built an Igloo.

4599
01:53:29,910 --> 01:53:32,810
I did a little sled dogging
and did some of this stuff,

4600
01:53:32,811 --> 01:53:33,140
which is,

4601
01:53:33,140 --> 01:53:34,670
which was totally fun.

4602
01:53:34,760 --> 01:53:35,900
Now when you build an Igloo,

4603
01:53:35,901 --> 01:53:36,531
how comfortable,

4604
01:53:36,531 --> 01:53:36,711
I mean,

4605
01:53:36,711 --> 01:53:40,010
how hold was about outside
and how comfortable is it
actually inside the Igloo?

4606
01:53:40,160 --> 01:53:41,210
It's still pretty cold.

4607
01:53:41,211 --> 01:53:41,481
I mean,

4608
01:53:41,481 --> 01:53:41,930
you know,

4609
01:53:41,930 --> 01:53:42,410
in your,

4610
01:53:42,410 --> 01:53:46,040
you would have to raise up your bed a
little bit cause otherwise you melt into

4611
01:53:46,041 --> 01:53:46,874
the ice,

4612
01:53:47,650 --> 01:53:49,130
you put branches down or something.

4613
01:53:49,310 --> 01:53:52,640
One of the things about surviving
really cold is like conduction.

4614
01:53:52,640 --> 01:53:55,550
So touching things will
suck heat out of you.

4615
01:53:55,551 --> 01:53:56,171
So if you could,

4616
01:53:56,171 --> 01:54:00,980
you've got to get off the ground and
puts something between you and the ground

4617
01:54:00,981 --> 01:54:01,790
or you know,

4618
01:54:01,790 --> 01:54:02,810
really worn boots have,

4619
01:54:02,811 --> 01:54:05,650
haven't really fixed soul to
keep your feet off the nose.

4620
01:54:05,740 --> 01:54:06,071
Okay.

4621
01:54:06,071 --> 01:54:07,600
No right snow Kim.

4622
01:54:07,610 --> 01:54:10,220
It has kinda insulate but you still
don't want to be touching it cause you'll

4623
01:54:10,221 --> 01:54:10,761
melt into it.

4624
01:54:10,761 --> 01:54:11,560
Your body a warmer,

4625
01:54:11,560 --> 01:54:11,800
nothing,

4626
01:54:11,800 --> 01:54:12,210
nothing too.

4627
01:54:12,210 --> 01:54:14,390
And then they get you wet
and wet will kill you,

4628
01:54:14,570 --> 01:54:14,900
you know.

4629
01:54:14,900 --> 01:54:16,370
So inside the Igloo,

4630
01:54:16,371 --> 01:54:18,740
I think it would be like
a round zero degrees.

4631
01:54:19,090 --> 01:54:19,690
Wow.

4632
01:54:19,690 --> 01:54:20,540
Or a little bit below,

4633
01:54:20,541 --> 01:54:20,780
but,

4634
01:54:20,780 --> 01:54:21,470
but um,

4635
01:54:21,470 --> 01:54:21,651
you know,

4636
01:54:21,651 --> 01:54:22,461
outside of this 20,

4637
01:54:22,461 --> 01:54:25,820
30 below and there's no vegans
in the annual communities,

4638
01:54:25,970 --> 01:54:27,890
it's almost all hunter know,

4639
01:54:27,891 --> 01:54:28,490
gather.

4640
01:54:28,490 --> 01:54:28,731
I mean,

4641
01:54:28,731 --> 01:54:29,450
they eat,

4642
01:54:29,450 --> 01:54:32,540
they just hunt the hunter
[inaudible] I said you have to,

4643
01:54:32,541 --> 01:54:33,170
right?

4644
01:54:33,170 --> 01:54:33,470
Yeah.

4645
01:54:33,470 --> 01:54:34,070
And they don't,

4646
01:54:34,070 --> 01:54:37,190
they get supplied by the
Canadian government now and they,

4647
01:54:37,220 --> 01:54:37,520
they,

4648
01:54:37,520 --> 01:54:39,200
they're kind of been forced into towns.

4649
01:54:39,201 --> 01:54:41,360
It's actually really
depressing because there's,

4650
01:54:41,361 --> 01:54:42,194
you know,

4651
01:54:42,650 --> 01:54:43,820
there's no roads.

4652
01:54:44,720 --> 01:54:45,560
They had the Internet,

4653
01:54:45,780 --> 01:54:46,340
um,

4654
01:54:46,340 --> 01:54:47,101
but there's no road.

4655
01:54:47,101 --> 01:54:52,101
So they plan tickets like four grand to
fly to Montreal so that these kids grow

4656
01:54:52,341 --> 01:54:53,330
up there and they,

4657
01:54:53,331 --> 01:54:53,481
you know,

4658
01:54:53,481 --> 01:54:58,481
this town's 1200 people and they have
MTV and they have the Internet and then

4659
01:54:58,541 --> 01:54:59,600
they get movies and stuff,

4660
01:54:59,601 --> 01:55:00,980
but they really can't leave,

4661
01:55:01,010 --> 01:55:01,251
you know,

4662
01:55:01,251 --> 01:55:01,821
it's very,

4663
01:55:01,821 --> 01:55:03,590
very hard to make enough money to leave.

4664
01:55:03,591 --> 01:55:04,424
And so there's a lot of,

4665
01:55:04,430 --> 01:55:04,581
you know,

4666
01:55:04,581 --> 01:55:06,110
it's in it's native American community.

4667
01:55:06,111 --> 01:55:10,430
So there's what traditionally those
problems are alcoholism and all those,

4668
01:55:10,431 --> 01:55:11,230
you know,

4669
01:55:11,230 --> 01:55:11,750
you know,

4670
01:55:11,750 --> 01:55:13,790
not being a part of the
culture and all that stuff.

4671
01:55:13,850 --> 01:55:16,770
And what is the main foe occupation there?

4672
01:55:16,950 --> 01:55:17,510
They do,

4673
01:55:17,510 --> 01:55:17,811
you know,

4674
01:55:17,811 --> 01:55:18,170
there's,

4675
01:55:18,170 --> 01:55:22,310
there's some mining s support stuff
and exploration support stuff.

4676
01:55:22,311 --> 01:55:23,450
There's some tourism stuff,

4677
01:55:23,451 --> 01:55:23,631
you know,

4678
01:55:23,631 --> 01:55:25,040
people go up there and do trips.

4679
01:55:25,100 --> 01:55:25,640
Um,

4680
01:55:25,640 --> 01:55:27,500
and then there's hunting and gathering.

4681
01:55:27,530 --> 01:55:27,681
You know,

4682
01:55:27,681 --> 01:55:28,040
there's,

4683
01:55:28,040 --> 01:55:32,600
so do they sell this is they do some
crafts and stuff like that and they do

4684
01:55:32,930 --> 01:55:33,470
carve,

4685
01:55:33,470 --> 01:55:34,171
carve and,

4686
01:55:34,171 --> 01:55:35,510
and uh,

4687
01:55:35,630 --> 01:55:38,300
sell furs probably,

4688
01:55:38,301 --> 01:55:38,540
you know,

4689
01:55:38,540 --> 01:55:39,740
they're allowed to hunt anything.

4690
01:55:39,770 --> 01:55:40,680
I think whales are the,

4691
01:55:40,681 --> 01:55:42,320
they have a limit on the
whale quarter they can take,

4692
01:55:42,321 --> 01:55:44,100
but they hunt polar bear and they hunt

4693
01:55:44,120 --> 01:55:44,820
seals.

4694
01:55:44,820 --> 01:55:45,451
Polar bear.

4695
01:55:45,451 --> 01:55:45,631
Yeah.

4696
01:55:45,631 --> 01:55:46,201
I didn't get to,

4697
01:55:46,201 --> 01:55:46,531
but yeah,

4698
01:55:46,531 --> 01:55:47,940
they do polar bears.

4699
01:55:48,520 --> 01:55:49,310
And then we,

4700
01:55:49,310 --> 01:55:50,700
we got a Caribou while I was there,

4701
01:55:50,760 --> 01:55:51,181
you know,

4702
01:55:51,181 --> 01:55:52,230
but I didn't get to do it.

4703
01:55:52,231 --> 01:55:52,621
But they,

4704
01:55:52,621 --> 01:55:53,340
uh,

4705
01:55:53,340 --> 01:55:53,880
they have,

4706
01:55:53,880 --> 01:55:54,660
they like to play.

4707
01:55:54,660 --> 01:55:54,961
They're like,

4708
01:55:54,961 --> 01:55:55,141
you know,

4709
01:55:55,141 --> 01:55:55,311
they,

4710
01:55:55,311 --> 01:55:57,240
they stock the land like death.

4711
01:55:57,270 --> 01:55:57,421
I mean,

4712
01:55:57,421 --> 01:56:00,280
they just kill everything
because it's not my stair.

4713
01:56:00,360 --> 01:56:00,601
Well,

4714
01:56:00,601 --> 01:56:01,434
and this guy,

4715
01:56:02,070 --> 01:56:02,821
he's 60,

4716
01:56:02,821 --> 01:56:04,020
he was born in the Igloo.

4717
01:56:04,650 --> 01:56:04,920
Wow.

4718
01:56:04,920 --> 01:56:06,130
He has this born in England,

4719
01:56:06,150 --> 01:56:06,920
right.

4720
01:56:06,920 --> 01:56:10,770
Has the stories about his mom having to
kill a dog to survive because they were,

4721
01:56:10,800 --> 01:56:11,640
they were starving.

4722
01:56:11,790 --> 01:56:12,260
So,

4723
01:56:12,260 --> 01:56:12,431
you know,

4724
01:56:12,431 --> 01:56:16,620
he comes directly from absolute survival,

4725
01:56:16,621 --> 01:56:17,520
starvation,

4726
01:56:17,580 --> 01:56:18,300
the edge of it,

4727
01:56:18,300 --> 01:56:18,601
you know.

4728
01:56:18,601 --> 01:56:20,010
And so of course they kill,

4729
01:56:20,880 --> 01:56:21,091
you know,

4730
01:56:21,091 --> 01:56:21,781
more than they need.

4731
01:56:21,781 --> 01:56:24,000
And they put it in a
storage for the village.

4732
01:56:24,030 --> 01:56:26,820
I guess things don't get bad
because it's zero degrees outside,

4733
01:56:26,821 --> 01:56:28,140
so he'd just have a hole in the ground.

4734
01:56:28,170 --> 01:56:32,100
That's the huge advantage is that
you live in a freezer and they,

4735
01:56:32,101 --> 01:56:33,240
you know what Eskimo means?

4736
01:56:33,270 --> 01:56:35,190
It means people who eat raw meat in the,

4737
01:56:35,200 --> 01:56:37,200
in the Indian language.

4738
01:56:37,230 --> 01:56:37,831
Is it a,

4739
01:56:37,831 --> 01:56:39,510
a s instead of a slur,

4740
01:56:39,720 --> 01:56:41,400
the word as kind of a little bit,

4741
01:56:41,550 --> 01:56:41,791
it's,

4742
01:56:41,791 --> 01:56:42,471
they call themselves the,

4743
01:56:42,471 --> 01:56:42,870
into it.

4744
01:56:42,870 --> 01:56:44,670
And it would just means
that it's not like Spec.

4745
01:56:44,950 --> 01:56:46,230
It's not that bad,

4746
01:56:46,231 --> 01:56:46,590
but it's,

4747
01:56:46,590 --> 01:56:46,921
it's,

4748
01:56:46,921 --> 01:56:48,360
you're uneducated if you call them that,

4749
01:56:48,380 --> 01:56:49,213
like Jap.

4750
01:56:49,410 --> 01:56:49,801
Yes.

4751
01:56:49,801 --> 01:56:50,600
I don't even know.

4752
01:56:50,600 --> 01:56:51,750
I can't just that the record.

4753
01:56:51,830 --> 01:56:52,290
And he's like,

4754
01:56:52,290 --> 01:56:53,250
there's a spectrum,

4755
01:56:53,280 --> 01:56:53,481
you know,

4756
01:56:53,481 --> 01:56:56,260
like with obviously nigger
being the worst ones,

4757
01:56:56,610 --> 01:56:59,610
except for black people when they
throw it around and each other,

4758
01:56:59,760 --> 01:57:00,210
that's fine,

4759
01:57:00,210 --> 01:57:00,420
you know,

4760
01:57:00,420 --> 01:57:02,460
then it's fine or rappers or whatever.

4761
01:57:03,150 --> 01:57:04,110
Or Quintin Tarantino.

4762
01:57:04,380 --> 01:57:05,250
But if you,

4763
01:57:05,251 --> 01:57:05,610
uh,

4764
01:57:05,610 --> 01:57:07,830
you go from that to like Guinea,

4765
01:57:07,860 --> 01:57:08,970
like Italians,

4766
01:57:08,971 --> 01:57:11,040
we'll call each other guineas
and it's not that big a deal.

4767
01:57:11,110 --> 01:57:12,080
It's like it does it.

4768
01:57:12,090 --> 01:57:12,923
Cracker,

4769
01:57:13,020 --> 01:57:17,010
cracker six kind of add but not that
like actually it can have a sense of an

4770
01:57:17,011 --> 01:57:18,180
endearment to it,

4771
01:57:18,181 --> 01:57:19,380
but cracker doesn't really,

4772
01:57:19,381 --> 01:57:21,390
I guess so maybe crackers
worse than getting on,

4773
01:57:21,420 --> 01:57:22,620
but they're not that effective.

4774
01:57:22,770 --> 01:57:23,780
Well and always ask him,

4775
01:57:23,781 --> 01:57:23,921
oh,

4776
01:57:23,921 --> 01:57:24,720
in that line.

4777
01:57:24,720 --> 01:57:25,320
I Dunno.

4778
01:57:25,320 --> 01:57:25,921
I Dunno.

4779
01:57:25,921 --> 01:57:29,430
I don't think it's maybe even it's
milder than that cause there is like a

4780
01:57:29,440 --> 01:57:31,980
logistic logical historical.

4781
01:57:31,981 --> 01:57:33,840
So the Indians when they were introducing,

4782
01:57:34,460 --> 01:57:34,980
um,

4783
01:57:34,980 --> 01:57:36,570
the French to these people,

4784
01:57:36,571 --> 01:57:36,840
they're like,

4785
01:57:36,840 --> 01:57:36,931
oh,

4786
01:57:36,931 --> 01:57:38,010
they're the people who eat raw meat.

4787
01:57:38,040 --> 01:57:39,260
Eskimo is the,

4788
01:57:39,261 --> 01:57:40,094
in the,

4789
01:57:40,440 --> 01:57:40,800
uh,

4790
01:57:40,800 --> 01:57:42,300
cro language or something like that.

4791
01:57:42,301 --> 01:57:42,580
So they,

4792
01:57:42,580 --> 01:57:43,770
why is that bad that this is,

4793
01:57:43,771 --> 01:57:45,690
this doesn't seem like
they call themselves.

4794
01:57:45,720 --> 01:57:45,961
Right.

4795
01:57:45,961 --> 01:57:46,794
Okay.

4796
01:57:47,940 --> 01:57:49,050
So it's not that bad,

4797
01:57:49,051 --> 01:57:49,690
but they just don't,

4798
01:57:49,690 --> 01:57:50,000
they,

4799
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:50,580
they,

4800
01:57:50,580 --> 01:57:52,140
I always thought that if you
used the word and you wait,

4801
01:57:52,141 --> 01:57:52,980
you were an asshole.

4802
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:53,970
I was just trying too hard.

4803
01:57:54,060 --> 01:57:54,571
Oh really?

4804
01:57:54,571 --> 01:57:56,610
At the end you'd people shut up.

4805
01:57:56,880 --> 01:57:58,410
They do a lot of throwback Eskimos.

4806
01:57:58,411 --> 01:57:59,130
You fuck,

4807
01:57:59,130 --> 01:58:00,300
but I didn't know.

4808
01:58:00,360 --> 01:58:02,340
Then someone told me that
Eskimos a slur and I was like,

4809
01:58:02,370 --> 01:58:02,791
oh,

4810
01:58:02,791 --> 01:58:03,624
okay.

4811
01:58:03,960 --> 01:58:07,200
But we're getting to the point where
pretty much everything's a slur getting,

4812
01:58:07,370 --> 01:58:07,711
you know,

4813
01:58:07,711 --> 01:58:09,810
did you see the guy
who was the head of um,

4814
01:58:10,040 --> 01:58:10,560
uh,

4815
01:58:10,560 --> 01:58:13,140
Bravo had to apologize
for using the word twink?

4816
01:58:13,530 --> 01:58:14,040
No.

4817
01:58:14,040 --> 01:58:14,401
Yes.

4818
01:58:14,401 --> 01:58:15,230
And he's gay.

4819
01:58:15,230 --> 01:58:17,100
Let's twink mean twinks a weird gay guy.

4820
01:58:17,101 --> 01:58:18,270
Like a skinny gay guy.

4821
01:58:18,271 --> 01:58:18,810
Looks like a,

4822
01:58:18,810 --> 01:58:19,650
like a little boy.

4823
01:58:19,680 --> 01:58:20,490
The calm twinks.

4824
01:58:20,490 --> 01:58:20,940
Really?

4825
01:58:20,940 --> 01:58:21,211
Yeah.

4826
01:58:21,211 --> 01:58:24,720
He had to apologize for using the twic
cause apparently damage the twinks got

4827
01:58:24,721 --> 01:58:25,554
offended.

4828
01:58:27,750 --> 01:58:29,310
So sensitive.

4829
01:58:29,311 --> 01:58:30,001
And again,

4830
01:58:30,001 --> 01:58:30,930
I think a lot of that,

4831
01:58:30,960 --> 01:58:31,800
this sensitivity,

4832
01:58:31,801 --> 01:58:33,120
this ridiculous over.

4833
01:58:33,190 --> 01:58:33,570
Yeah.

4834
01:58:33,570 --> 01:58:35,880
It's because of the fact that we're
not dealing with real survival issues.

4835
01:58:35,881 --> 01:58:37,410
So we look for things to bicker about.

4836
01:58:37,650 --> 01:58:37,891
Yeah.

4837
01:58:37,891 --> 01:58:39,570
Know you think about sports,

4838
01:58:39,571 --> 01:58:41,190
like entirely sports.

4839
01:58:41,270 --> 01:58:41,990
It's like

4840
01:58:41,990 --> 01:58:43,820
because you don't have survival concerns.

4841
01:58:43,821 --> 01:58:44,420
Yes.

4842
01:58:44,420 --> 01:58:45,590
So you watch,

4843
01:58:45,650 --> 01:58:45,861
I mean,

4844
01:58:45,861 --> 01:58:48,920
I always think about it like
you watch other men to sort of,

4845
01:58:48,921 --> 01:58:49,221
you know,

4846
01:58:49,221 --> 01:58:50,750
because of the caveman thing and see,

4847
01:58:50,751 --> 01:58:52,150
do I want that guy hunting with me?

4848
01:58:52,160 --> 01:58:52,911
Don't want them with me.

4849
01:58:52,911 --> 01:58:55,190
But that's the whole thing.

4850
01:58:55,850 --> 01:58:58,290
It's like we're addicted to watch it.

4851
01:58:58,300 --> 01:58:59,720
It touches everybody.

4852
01:58:59,721 --> 01:59:03,390
We all have a genetic predilection to
watch men do shit because it's got a

4853
01:59:03,391 --> 01:59:04,280
survival,

4854
01:59:05,160 --> 01:59:05,480
you know,

4855
01:59:05,480 --> 01:59:06,313
impetus.

4856
01:59:06,830 --> 01:59:07,670
And yet,

4857
01:59:07,700 --> 01:59:07,970
you know,

4858
01:59:07,970 --> 01:59:09,050
that's all it is.

4859
01:59:09,080 --> 01:59:09,590
It's like,

4860
01:59:09,590 --> 01:59:10,550
and it's like a,

4861
01:59:10,551 --> 01:59:12,290
it's sort of absurd,

4862
01:59:12,291 --> 01:59:12,671
you know?

4863
01:59:12,671 --> 01:59:13,630
And yet it's,

4864
01:59:13,650 --> 01:59:14,060
it's,

4865
01:59:14,060 --> 01:59:14,710
it's,

4866
01:59:14,710 --> 01:59:15,543
you know,

4867
01:59:15,920 --> 01:59:17,090
it's the biggest thing in the world.

4868
01:59:17,240 --> 01:59:18,260
It's sort of observed,

4869
01:59:18,261 --> 01:59:23,261
but yet it's also sort of natural that
it's this kind of bridge between our

4870
01:59:24,411 --> 01:59:27,620
civilization and our ancient history.

4871
01:59:27,621 --> 01:59:28,370
Yeah.

4872
01:59:28,370 --> 01:59:29,690
It's really strange prowess.

4873
01:59:29,720 --> 01:59:29,970
Yeah.

4874
01:59:29,970 --> 01:59:31,490
It keeps us active.

4875
01:59:31,520 --> 01:59:32,660
It keeps us in the mix,

4876
01:59:33,320 --> 01:59:34,580
which is observing,

4877
01:59:34,581 --> 01:59:35,230
gauging,

4878
01:59:35,230 --> 01:59:36,063
you know?

4879
01:59:36,230 --> 01:59:36,810
Yeah.

4880
01:59:36,810 --> 01:59:37,580
Common Russian.

4881
01:59:37,580 --> 01:59:38,000
Yeah.

4882
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:39,980
Gauging domination and caging.

4883
01:59:40,490 --> 01:59:43,400
There's a chart and what we value,

4884
01:59:43,490 --> 01:59:44,480
it's very strange.

4885
01:59:44,540 --> 01:59:45,260
It is.

4886
01:59:45,260 --> 01:59:48,260
What's really strange is that
if you look at it as a pattern,

4887
01:59:48,320 --> 01:59:49,070
as you said,

4888
01:59:49,070 --> 01:59:49,940
you know about the,

4889
01:59:50,060 --> 01:59:51,170
our modern civilization.

4890
01:59:51,171 --> 01:59:53,720
If you looked at the book
of the history of the world,

4891
01:59:53,960 --> 01:59:56,480
our modern civilization
is like a one sentence.

4892
01:59:56,490 --> 01:59:57,290
A couple of paragraphs.

4893
01:59:57,290 --> 01:59:57,980
Yeah.

4894
01:59:57,980 --> 02:00:01,550
And if you look at where
we're going and you see this,

4895
02:00:01,551 --> 02:00:02,211
this sort of,

4896
02:00:02,211 --> 02:00:03,470
these trains trends,

4897
02:00:03,471 --> 02:00:06,320
and look at us as hunter
gatherers 10,000 years ago,

4898
02:00:06,321 --> 02:00:06,891
look at us as,

4899
02:00:06,891 --> 02:00:07,724
or you know,

4900
02:00:07,880 --> 02:00:09,380
wherever it was in history,

4901
02:00:09,381 --> 02:00:12,490
and look at us today and look at
what is 10,000 years from now.

4902
02:00:12,780 --> 02:00:13,300
It's uh,

4903
02:00:13,300 --> 02:00:14,750
it's impossible to gauge.

4904
02:00:14,920 --> 02:00:16,070
It's too confusing.

4905
02:00:16,071 --> 02:00:17,330
It's too alien.

4906
02:00:17,690 --> 02:00:19,910
And there's a lot of
people that hate sports.

4907
02:00:20,120 --> 02:00:22,850
There's a lot of people that hate jocks
and meatheads and the whole idea of the

4908
02:00:22,851 --> 02:00:24,020
male dominator culture.

4909
02:00:24,021 --> 02:00:25,700
That's sort of this leftover thing.

4910
02:00:25,701 --> 02:00:28,070
But what is the alternative?

4911
02:00:28,071 --> 02:00:30,470
Because I wonder what are I going to do?

4912
02:00:30,471 --> 02:00:31,304
Are we going to be,

4913
02:00:33,080 --> 02:00:34,820
the alternative is very,

4914
02:00:34,880 --> 02:00:35,170
it's,

4915
02:00:35,170 --> 02:00:40,170
it's very confusing when you're talking
about synthetic skin and the ability to

4916
02:00:40,221 --> 02:00:42,170
recreate brain cells in,

4917
02:00:42,171 --> 02:00:42,411
in,

4918
02:00:42,411 --> 02:00:42,741
in,

4919
02:00:42,741 --> 02:00:43,101
in,

4920
02:00:43,101 --> 02:00:44,160
in a laboratory up.

4921
02:00:44,570 --> 02:00:44,840
Yeah.

4922
02:00:44,840 --> 02:00:45,081
I mean,

4923
02:00:45,081 --> 02:00:45,500
what do they,

4924
02:00:45,500 --> 02:00:46,310
what are they trying to meet?

4925
02:00:46,310 --> 02:00:47,810
They're going to make
another tronic brain.

4926
02:00:47,811 --> 02:00:51,830
They're going to make electronic
bulletproof brain when computers,

4927
02:00:51,910 --> 02:00:54,470
when artificial intelligence
is start building art,

4928
02:00:54,471 --> 02:00:55,610
other artificial intelligence,

4929
02:00:56,210 --> 02:00:59,820
all that stuff you'll all
off on you don't get crazy.

4930
02:01:00,500 --> 02:01:04,730
They see that that's the big worry is
not the invention of the artificial

4931
02:01:04,731 --> 02:01:05,564
intelligence.

4932
02:01:05,660 --> 02:01:08,210
It's what the artificial
intelligence does.

4933
02:01:08,690 --> 02:01:09,630
It becomes sentience,

4934
02:01:09,920 --> 02:01:13,550
is that it will improve upon the design
that are fucking measly brains have

4935
02:01:13,551 --> 02:01:15,530
created and improve upon it.

4936
02:01:15,980 --> 02:01:19,870
10,000 years worth of evolution and then
a couple of weeks they'll just have the

4937
02:01:19,910 --> 02:01:21,590
apocalypse robo apocalypse.

4938
02:01:21,620 --> 02:01:24,410
Did you and I will still give me a blurb.

4939
02:01:24,411 --> 02:01:25,100
He liked the book.

4940
02:01:25,100 --> 02:01:25,400
Ah,

4941
02:01:25,400 --> 02:01:26,233
he's awesome.

4942
02:01:26,330 --> 02:01:26,571
Oh,

4943
02:01:26,571 --> 02:01:29,370
unfortunately Steven Spielberg
decided to not do that.

4944
02:01:29,540 --> 02:01:30,200
Is that what happened?

4945
02:01:30,200 --> 02:01:33,380
And do some other fucking stupid piece
of shit movie that no one's going to like

4946
02:01:33,381 --> 02:01:34,214
about a dog.

4947
02:01:35,220 --> 02:01:35,340
No,

4948
02:01:35,340 --> 02:01:35,440
no,

4949
02:01:35,440 --> 02:01:35,600
no.

4950
02:01:35,600 --> 02:01:36,410
What did he just do?

4951
02:01:36,410 --> 02:01:37,340
What's his last name?

4952
02:01:39,050 --> 02:01:40,430
I guess robot apocalypse also.

4953
02:01:40,431 --> 02:01:44,510
You worry about like it's cool to
sort of a very I robotic in theory.

4954
02:01:44,670 --> 02:01:45,170
Yeah.

4955
02:01:45,170 --> 02:01:46,003
Was it was,

4956
02:01:46,140 --> 02:01:47,000
it was interesting.

4957
02:01:47,030 --> 02:01:50,300
I mean I think Daniel Watson is a
really interesting robotic wise.

4958
02:01:50,310 --> 02:01:51,310
You mean storywise?

4959
02:01:51,340 --> 02:01:51,740
Yeah,

4960
02:01:51,740 --> 02:01:52,430
that's good.

4961
02:01:52,430 --> 02:01:53,120
I hadn't read it.

4962
02:01:53,120 --> 02:01:54,140
We've had him on the podcast,

4963
02:01:54,141 --> 02:01:55,010
so it was really cool.

4964
02:01:55,011 --> 02:01:57,050
So I was rooting for him.

4965
02:01:57,051 --> 02:01:58,480
And then when I found out that they,

4966
02:01:58,930 --> 02:02:01,130
Steven Spielberg cancel
production in the Bronx,

4967
02:02:01,370 --> 02:02:02,900
I assumed it was because it was too good.

4968
02:02:03,240 --> 02:02:05,180
I assumed that that was a point where,

4969
02:02:05,670 --> 02:02:05,840
yeah,

4970
02:02:05,840 --> 02:02:07,370
Spielberg is a weird cat now.

4971
02:02:07,420 --> 02:02:07,790
Yeah.

4972
02:02:07,790 --> 02:02:08,840
Everything is four acts.

4973
02:02:08,841 --> 02:02:09,110
You're like,

4974
02:02:09,110 --> 02:02:09,460
all right.

4975
02:02:09,460 --> 02:02:09,780
Yeah.

4976
02:02:09,780 --> 02:02:10,430
Yeah.

4977
02:02:10,430 --> 02:02:13,670
Well I think a lot of those older
dudes that George Lucas type guys,

4978
02:02:13,671 --> 02:02:18,440
they get so much money and so much they
hit the spot where they made a million

4979
02:02:18,441 --> 02:02:22,300
awesome movies and then
it just is a little patty.

4980
02:02:22,310 --> 02:02:22,970
Is it theory?

4981
02:02:22,970 --> 02:02:25,900
As my wife has a isn't it makes
movies and one of her theories is,

4982
02:02:25,901 --> 02:02:26,734
uh,

4983
02:02:27,110 --> 02:02:27,701
it kill you.

4984
02:02:27,701 --> 02:02:29,420
You kill yourself to
make something really,

4985
02:02:29,421 --> 02:02:30,254
really good.

4986
02:02:30,400 --> 02:02:30,650
It,

4987
02:02:30,650 --> 02:02:31,850
you just kill yourself,

4988
02:02:31,851 --> 02:02:32,061
right?

4989
02:02:32,061 --> 02:02:33,610
You sacrifice your family and your,

4990
02:02:33,670 --> 02:02:38,670
your health and everything and then
you sorta don't want to do it again.

4991
02:02:39,380 --> 02:02:39,741
And then,

4992
02:02:39,741 --> 02:02:43,190
so you kind kinda do a little bit
less and everyone's still like,

4993
02:02:43,220 --> 02:02:43,551
oh,

4994
02:02:43,551 --> 02:02:44,420
that was amazing.

4995
02:02:44,421 --> 02:02:44,960
And you're like,

4996
02:02:44,960 --> 02:02:47,120
nobody fucking noticed
that I didn't kill myself,

4997
02:02:47,450 --> 02:02:48,710
so I'm going to keep doing it.

4998
02:02:48,880 --> 02:02:49,220
You know?

4999
02:02:49,220 --> 02:02:51,230
And then you start phoning
it in because you're like,

5000
02:02:51,231 --> 02:02:52,160
I want to have a regular life.

5001
02:02:52,161 --> 02:02:54,010
I want to work eight hours
a day or 10 you know,

5002
02:02:54,020 --> 02:02:58,760
I don't want to work 15 hours a day
for 300 days and not have a life.

5003
02:02:58,761 --> 02:02:59,180
Again.

5004
02:02:59,180 --> 02:03:02,090
I think there's that
motivation to push you.

5005
02:03:02,220 --> 02:03:04,370
Especially I think in the world of movies,

5006
02:03:04,371 --> 02:03:09,050
I think that's probably one of the most
difficult endeavors to make a giant

5007
02:03:09,051 --> 02:03:10,130
blockbuster film.

5008
02:03:10,131 --> 02:03:11,300
Like to make an Avatar.

5009
02:03:11,310 --> 02:03:14,450
Like here's a guy that was telling me
about James Cameron and he was like,

5010
02:03:14,810 --> 02:03:17,270
like Oh James Cameron such a Douche bag.

5011
02:03:17,300 --> 02:03:18,950
Like I had to work with
them on this movie.

5012
02:03:18,950 --> 02:03:19,783
He's such a con.

5013
02:03:20,030 --> 02:03:22,680
And I was like thinking about
like how lazy this guy is,

5014
02:03:22,870 --> 02:03:26,900
how annoying it probably be having this
guy worked for you when you're a guy

5015
02:03:26,901 --> 02:03:28,460
like James counter percent.

5016
02:03:28,860 --> 02:03:31,400
I'm going to make after talk everybody.

5017
02:03:31,410 --> 02:03:32,450
Yeah I'm making this,

5018
02:03:32,570 --> 02:03:33,470
we're doing it my way.

5019
02:03:33,471 --> 02:03:36,890
We're going to do this because I know
you don't know why cause you don't know

5020
02:03:36,891 --> 02:03:37,430
what's going on.

5021
02:03:37,430 --> 02:03:38,300
And everyone's like,

5022
02:03:38,330 --> 02:03:39,470
oh he's so hard to work with.

5023
02:03:39,710 --> 02:03:40,540
Yeah.

5024
02:03:40,540 --> 02:03:42,020
Cause he's trying to do something amazing.

5025
02:03:42,021 --> 02:03:42,201
Like,

5026
02:03:42,201 --> 02:03:42,631
you know what I mean?

5027
02:03:42,631 --> 02:03:43,840
And that's what it takes and it's,

5028
02:03:43,850 --> 02:03:45,440
it's I 100% agree.

5029
02:03:45,441 --> 02:03:46,274
Like people,

5030
02:03:46,640 --> 02:03:48,080
I mean that guy has a stud,

5031
02:03:48,081 --> 02:03:48,914
dude,

5032
02:03:49,160 --> 02:03:50,030
Cameron is a stud.

5033
02:03:50,031 --> 02:03:50,900
He's a bad motherfucker,

5034
02:03:51,310 --> 02:03:52,910
made so many awesome movies.

5035
02:03:52,911 --> 02:03:53,211
So he,

5036
02:03:53,211 --> 02:03:53,331
yeah,

5037
02:03:53,331 --> 02:03:53,871
he basically,

5038
02:03:53,871 --> 02:03:54,704
you know,

5039
02:03:54,710 --> 02:03:57,650
and you have to have that and you have,

5040
02:03:57,770 --> 02:03:58,820
people are like,

5041
02:03:58,870 --> 02:03:59,170
could you,

5042
02:03:59,170 --> 02:04:00,710
cause people want to do the easiest thing.

5043
02:04:00,710 --> 02:04:01,131
So like,

5044
02:04:01,131 --> 02:04:01,251
you know,

5045
02:04:01,251 --> 02:04:01,521
they're like,

5046
02:04:01,521 --> 02:04:01,641
oh,

5047
02:04:01,641 --> 02:04:03,050
it makes you feel good enough.

5048
02:04:03,440 --> 02:04:04,131
It's good.

5049
02:04:04,131 --> 02:04:04,740
It's really good.

5050
02:04:04,740 --> 02:04:05,031
See,

5051
02:04:05,031 --> 02:04:07,850
his intensity only exists
when it's your idea.

5052
02:04:07,851 --> 02:04:09,950
You don't have that intensity
when you're working for somebody.

5053
02:04:10,070 --> 02:04:10,903
You just don't,

5054
02:04:11,140 --> 02:04:11,400
you know,

5055
02:04:11,400 --> 02:04:11,670
the,

5056
02:04:11,670 --> 02:04:13,130
that's when it's your baby.

5057
02:04:13,250 --> 02:04:14,330
That's when it's your life,

5058
02:04:14,331 --> 02:04:15,164
when it's everything.

5059
02:04:15,170 --> 02:04:19,540
Otherwise you just maybe hit eight
and he's at 10 you might get a seven,

5060
02:04:20,810 --> 02:04:23,660
you're not going to get 10 and he
not going to want to pay that price.

5061
02:04:23,810 --> 02:04:26,290
And that fucking guy wakes
up or running at 10 you know,

5062
02:04:26,300 --> 02:04:26,631
and you're like,

5063
02:04:26,631 --> 02:04:28,820
oh Jesus now has an asshole to work for.

5064
02:04:28,880 --> 02:04:29,121
Yeah,

5065
02:04:29,121 --> 02:04:29,930
of course.

5066
02:04:29,930 --> 02:04:32,180
Like he's trying to do something
good and I'm just guessing,

5067
02:04:32,181 --> 02:04:33,110
maybe he is an asshole.

5068
02:04:33,200 --> 02:04:33,561
The fuck.

5069
02:04:33,561 --> 02:04:35,030
Do I know somebody listening to this man?

5070
02:04:35,031 --> 02:04:35,270
No,

5071
02:04:35,270 --> 02:04:35,511
no,

5072
02:04:35,511 --> 02:04:35,751
no,

5073
02:04:35,751 --> 02:04:35,961
no,

5074
02:04:35,961 --> 02:04:36,794
no.

5075
02:04:36,850 --> 02:04:39,270
Two shads an asshole.

5076
02:04:39,600 --> 02:04:41,880
He told me to repaint the
entire side of the boat.

5077
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:42,900
It was the wrong color.

5078
02:04:42,910 --> 02:04:43,743
Gray.

5079
02:04:43,860 --> 02:04:45,840
Who cares about taught me,

5080
02:04:45,841 --> 02:04:46,560
this is a ridiculous,

5081
02:04:46,560 --> 02:04:49,800
but like Tom Cruise gets the wrong
sandwich and he threw it at the guy,

5082
02:04:49,801 --> 02:04:51,330
the assistant and everyone's like,

5083
02:04:51,331 --> 02:04:52,470
Tom Cruise is such a dick.

5084
02:04:52,890 --> 02:04:53,723
It's like dude,

5085
02:04:54,030 --> 02:04:56,160
I'm carrying this $150 million movie.

5086
02:04:56,190 --> 02:04:59,990
You're job is to get me the right
fucking sandwich and you're not doing it.

5087
02:05:00,040 --> 02:05:01,350
Like you know what I mean?

5088
02:05:01,351 --> 02:05:03,410
Like go get the wrong sandwich too.

5089
02:05:03,600 --> 02:05:06,900
Like it's all you have to do today
is bring Tom Cruise that right.

5090
02:05:06,901 --> 02:05:07,170
Sam,

5091
02:05:07,170 --> 02:05:08,610
I don't need any fucking confusion here.

5092
02:05:08,611 --> 02:05:09,444
I'm Tom Cruise.

5093
02:05:09,630 --> 02:05:10,440
I'm trying to do,

5094
02:05:10,440 --> 02:05:12,220
should have a lot of shit going on here,

5095
02:05:12,240 --> 02:05:12,480
man.

5096
02:05:12,480 --> 02:05:14,070
Scientology and my sexuality.

5097
02:05:14,870 --> 02:05:15,960
Sandwich confusion.

5098
02:05:16,560 --> 02:05:17,640
Do your job.

5099
02:05:17,880 --> 02:05:18,310
So I know,

5100
02:05:18,310 --> 02:05:21,780
I feel like that's a lot of times you
hear that about people and it's like,

5101
02:05:21,800 --> 02:05:22,291
cause it's also,

5102
02:05:22,291 --> 02:05:22,770
again,

5103
02:05:22,770 --> 02:05:24,780
it goes back to what we
were talking about earlier,

5104
02:05:24,781 --> 02:05:29,070
it's like this is artificial stress and
we've sort of created the end of the

5105
02:05:29,070 --> 02:05:29,071
day,

5106
02:05:29,071 --> 02:05:30,270
it's just a piece of entertainment.

5107
02:05:30,270 --> 02:05:31,200
It's a fucking movie.

5108
02:05:31,201 --> 02:05:31,410
Okay.

5109
02:05:31,410 --> 02:05:32,880
It's not running from a tiger.

5110
02:05:33,240 --> 02:05:33,940
It's a movie.

5111
02:05:33,940 --> 02:05:34,773
Goddammit.

5112
02:05:35,040 --> 02:05:36,330
No one should die making a movie.

5113
02:05:36,430 --> 02:05:37,440
Exactly.

5114
02:05:37,470 --> 02:05:37,830
Yeah.

5115
02:05:37,830 --> 02:05:39,470
Do you follow the walking dead?

5116
02:05:39,500 --> 02:05:39,901
You follow?

5117
02:05:39,901 --> 02:05:40,920
Like I don't follow it.

5118
02:05:40,921 --> 02:05:41,430
I know,

5119
02:05:41,430 --> 02:05:43,690
I know a little bit about comic books.

5120
02:05:43,940 --> 02:05:44,460
Oh yeah.

5121
02:05:44,460 --> 02:05:44,940
World War.

5122
02:05:44,940 --> 02:05:46,350
He was like one of my favorite books.

5123
02:05:46,480 --> 02:05:46,950
So,

5124
02:05:46,950 --> 02:05:49,170
and that it so funny it
was pitching this book.

5125
02:05:49,380 --> 02:05:49,711
I was like,

5126
02:05:49,711 --> 02:05:49,831
yeah,

5127
02:05:49,831 --> 02:05:50,220
I'm gonna do this.

5128
02:05:50,220 --> 02:05:51,020
And they all like,

5129
02:05:51,020 --> 02:05:51,930
and all these New Yorker,

5130
02:05:51,990 --> 02:05:52,381
this is,

5131
02:05:52,381 --> 02:05:52,560
you know,

5132
02:05:52,560 --> 02:05:54,450
before walking dead comes
out and they're all like,

5133
02:05:55,080 --> 02:05:55,710
zombies,

5134
02:05:55,710 --> 02:05:56,850
nobody's gonna read this.

5135
02:05:56,851 --> 02:05:57,990
You're crazy

5136
02:06:00,440 --> 02:06:00,880
now.

5137
02:06:00,880 --> 02:06:01,940
Zombies are everywhere.

5138
02:06:02,400 --> 02:06:02,960
No,

5139
02:06:02,960 --> 02:06:04,680
there's Zombie porn now.

5140
02:06:04,920 --> 02:06:05,130
Oh,

5141
02:06:05,130 --> 02:06:06,090
I'm not surprised.

5142
02:06:06,210 --> 02:06:11,210
There's CGI porn that people are
creating and that is so close to like,

5143
02:06:11,790 --> 02:06:12,623
it's like,

5144
02:06:12,810 --> 02:06:14,940
it's pretty obvious that
it's not really people,

5145
02:06:15,090 --> 02:06:18,390
but it looks enough like real people
that you could beat off to it.

5146
02:06:18,570 --> 02:06:18,901
I mean,

5147
02:06:18,901 --> 02:06:20,100
you're not going to get confused,

5148
02:06:20,101 --> 02:06:25,101
but there's some porn where it
leads the way and a lot of things.

5149
02:06:25,321 --> 02:06:25,781
Technology,

5150
02:06:25,781 --> 02:06:29,790
fucking monsters banging chicks
with their big monster dicks.

5151
02:06:29,791 --> 02:06:30,240
And you're like,

5152
02:06:30,240 --> 02:06:31,160
who is this?

5153
02:06:31,190 --> 02:06:33,960
The Japanese Japanese with Japanese.

5154
02:06:33,961 --> 02:06:36,510
It's an American Pankaj there's a,

5155
02:06:36,600 --> 02:06:40,830
there's this weird sort of a
Zombie thing that's going on.

5156
02:06:40,950 --> 02:06:41,491
Well they have a,

5157
02:06:41,491 --> 02:06:43,410
there's a movie now like a twilight.

5158
02:06:44,620 --> 02:06:47,220
What does chicken falls in
love with the Zombie yet?

5159
02:06:47,221 --> 02:06:47,371
Well,

5160
02:06:47,371 --> 02:06:49,710
you've got to the point that with
the Zombie genre you're getting into,

5161
02:06:49,711 --> 02:06:51,390
like you have to fizzling out.

5162
02:06:51,391 --> 02:06:52,130
Awesome.

5163
02:06:52,130 --> 02:06:52,280
Yeah.

5164
02:06:52,280 --> 02:06:53,520
You have to do the next thing,

5165
02:06:53,521 --> 02:06:53,761
right?

5166
02:06:53,761 --> 02:06:55,640
Which is like when does
the unforgiven of theirs?

5167
02:06:55,690 --> 02:06:58,920
Like I always feel like unforgiven kind
of like ended the western in a way.

5168
02:06:58,921 --> 02:06:59,151
You know,

5169
02:06:59,151 --> 02:06:59,720
like it's,

5170
02:06:59,720 --> 02:07:02,480
it's like the Uber most
perfect western ever made.

5171
02:07:02,481 --> 02:07:04,950
It's one of my favorite movies of all
time me to be the best movie ever made.

5172
02:07:04,950 --> 02:07:05,783
But it's like,

5173
02:07:06,060 --> 02:07:07,030
what's the western?

5174
02:07:07,100 --> 02:07:08,340
You can't do it western anymore.

5175
02:07:08,341 --> 02:07:08,911
It's really hard.

5176
02:07:08,911 --> 02:07:11,970
Like you'd make fun of Westerns
or you do it satirically or,

5177
02:07:12,330 --> 02:07:14,130
and I feel like there's Zombie genres.

5178
02:07:14,460 --> 02:07:15,131
It's headed that way.

5179
02:07:15,131 --> 02:07:16,040
And you know,

5180
02:07:16,140 --> 02:07:20,340
I have a friend who's making World War
z with Brad Pitt and I'm real curious to

5181
02:07:20,341 --> 02:07:21,260
see how that comes in.

5182
02:07:21,290 --> 02:07:22,123
What happens.

5183
02:07:22,650 --> 02:07:23,483
I am legend.

5184
02:07:24,450 --> 02:07:25,300
Uh,

5185
02:07:26,070 --> 02:07:26,780
no,

5186
02:07:26,780 --> 02:07:26,921
I,

5187
02:07:26,921 --> 02:07:27,280
I,

5188
02:07:27,280 --> 02:07:27,510
you know,

5189
02:07:27,510 --> 02:07:29,730
I think the CG zombies heard it.

5190
02:07:29,940 --> 02:07:30,773
Yeah.

5191
02:07:30,790 --> 02:07:34,050
Guys in Zombie costumes are
much scarier than CG zombies.

5192
02:07:34,110 --> 02:07:34,950
That's interesting.

5193
02:07:35,010 --> 02:07:35,520
Yeah.

5194
02:07:35,520 --> 02:07:36,301
I see what you mean.

5195
02:07:36,301 --> 02:07:36,541
Yeah.

5196
02:07:36,541 --> 02:07:37,270
They love the,

5197
02:07:37,270 --> 02:07:40,730
with their mouths open and it was
pretty obviously a little fast and yeah,

5198
02:07:40,750 --> 02:07:43,380
something about it that
doesn't quite read where Eva,

5199
02:07:43,440 --> 02:07:44,520
did you see the gray?

5200
02:07:44,670 --> 02:07:45,220
Yes.

5201
02:07:45,220 --> 02:07:46,890
Like I think if it had been real wolves,

5202
02:07:46,891 --> 02:07:48,030
I would have been more scared.

5203
02:07:49,020 --> 02:07:49,410
Really?

5204
02:07:49,410 --> 02:07:50,071
Yeah.

5205
02:07:50,071 --> 02:07:50,520
I Dunno.

5206
02:07:50,520 --> 02:07:51,390
They looked pretty real.

5207
02:07:51,420 --> 02:07:52,210
Did you liked it?

5208
02:07:52,210 --> 02:07:53,100
Thought they looked real hard.

5209
02:07:53,130 --> 02:07:56,580
I thought the behavior that
they exhibited is not really,

5210
02:07:56,920 --> 02:07:59,820
the bowls are much more
concerned with survival and that,

5211
02:07:59,870 --> 02:08:00,140
you know,

5212
02:08:00,140 --> 02:08:01,890
if they'd lost a few
wolves to these people,

5213
02:08:01,891 --> 02:08:02,810
they probably steer clear.

5214
02:08:03,420 --> 02:08:06,850
They wouldn't hunt them and
dramatic pace of the movie.

5215
02:08:06,940 --> 02:08:07,330
Yeah,

5216
02:08:07,330 --> 02:08:07,980
this and that.

5217
02:08:07,980 --> 02:08:10,470
But the way they were separating
them from other people,

5218
02:08:10,530 --> 02:08:10,921
you know,

5219
02:08:10,921 --> 02:08:11,641
but I thought I was like,

5220
02:08:11,641 --> 02:08:12,210
man,

5221
02:08:12,210 --> 02:08:13,230
that's a little clever.

5222
02:08:13,290 --> 02:08:16,420
But I guess I guess what they're doing
is they're making something fiction and

5223
02:08:16,421 --> 02:08:17,490
I'm willing to,

5224
02:08:17,540 --> 02:08:17,980
yeah,

5225
02:08:17,980 --> 02:08:18,480
yeah.

5226
02:08:18,480 --> 02:08:19,170
Go on the ride.

5227
02:08:19,170 --> 02:08:19,501
Yeah.

5228
02:08:19,501 --> 02:08:20,580
I'm willing to go on that ride.

5229
02:08:20,640 --> 02:08:21,473
Yeah.

5230
02:08:21,520 --> 02:08:25,090
Mommy wrote the gay off on
opion Anthony this week.

5231
02:08:25,091 --> 02:08:25,560
Joe,

5232
02:08:25,560 --> 02:08:28,500
what it gay off on the Anthony
Opie and Anthony this week?

5233
02:08:29,190 --> 02:08:29,500
Yeah.

5234
02:08:29,500 --> 02:08:29,741
No.

5235
02:08:29,741 --> 02:08:30,190
What are you talking to?

5236
02:08:30,190 --> 02:08:31,360
You got to download.

5237
02:08:31,361 --> 02:08:32,890
You can download off audible.

5238
02:08:33,120 --> 02:08:34,990
It was like last Wednesday I think it was.

5239
02:08:35,170 --> 02:08:38,860
They had a gay off the first annual gay
off Andrew Dice Clay is in studio and

5240
02:08:38,861 --> 02:08:40,720
what they do is they
take four married guys.

5241
02:08:40,721 --> 02:08:43,510
They bring their wives
and these guys are like,

5242
02:08:43,511 --> 02:08:48,511
haven't done gay stuff before ever and
they have to do gay stuff in front of

5243
02:08:48,551 --> 02:08:53,230
their wise to try to win $1,200 and it
got to the point where they ended up

5244
02:08:53,231 --> 02:08:57,250
bringing like this guy from Craig's list
and that was a gay escort or something

5245
02:08:57,251 --> 02:08:57,581
like that.

5246
02:08:57,581 --> 02:08:58,111
I can't remember that.

5247
02:08:58,111 --> 02:09:03,111
A dancer and at 1.1 guy's like jacking
him off with oil while making out with

5248
02:09:04,991 --> 02:09:05,201
him.

5249
02:09:05,201 --> 02:09:08,720
The other guy's putting his
nose on his ass hole and it was,

5250
02:09:09,320 --> 02:09:12,580
it was some of the most
funniest shit I've ever heard.

5251
02:09:12,760 --> 02:09:15,250
Andrew dice clay lasted
like 10 minutes in it.

5252
02:09:15,251 --> 02:09:17,010
Like he got to the point where
they were tickling each other.

5253
02:09:17,011 --> 02:09:17,410
He goes,

5254
02:09:17,410 --> 02:09:18,430
oh this is pretty good.

5255
02:09:18,431 --> 02:09:21,180
And then like the next one was like
something like LDF at mouth kiss.

5256
02:09:21,181 --> 02:09:21,401
He's like,

5257
02:09:21,401 --> 02:09:22,010
I'm Outta here.

5258
02:09:22,010 --> 02:09:22,843
He just left.

5259
02:09:23,100 --> 02:09:24,010
I love your dice.

5260
02:09:24,011 --> 02:09:24,844
Oppression.

5261
02:09:25,500 --> 02:09:26,333
Terrible.

5262
02:09:27,490 --> 02:09:29,770
It's like a combination
of bum delouis and dice.

5263
02:09:29,950 --> 02:09:31,540
And that's another thing I is Opi does.

5264
02:09:31,700 --> 02:09:36,550
If you listened to any episode that
Andrew Dice Clay is in studio opiate has

5265
02:09:36,551 --> 02:09:36,701
this,

5266
02:09:36,701 --> 02:09:37,810
I'm moving here now.

5267
02:09:37,811 --> 02:09:38,630
Kind of like,

5268
02:09:38,630 --> 02:09:41,080
like kind of like a commentary
Tina with black people.

5269
02:09:42,360 --> 02:09:43,980
It's a little east coast on them.

5270
02:09:44,620 --> 02:09:45,880
It comes out really bad.

5271
02:09:46,030 --> 02:09:47,230
Well it's fun to talk like dice.

5272
02:09:47,231 --> 02:09:47,690
Yeah.

5273
02:09:47,690 --> 02:09:48,523
Oh,

5274
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:52,300
you know when you have Dyson
and whenever we have minutes,

5275
02:09:52,301 --> 02:09:53,470
it's almost contagious.

5276
02:09:53,530 --> 02:09:54,130
Yeah,

5277
02:09:54,130 --> 02:09:54,963
absolutely.

5278
02:09:55,150 --> 02:09:55,510
Yeah.

5279
02:09:55,510 --> 02:09:55,930
Um,

5280
02:09:55,930 --> 02:09:57,730
I don't know if I want to be in the room,

5281
02:09:57,731 --> 02:09:59,720
I dudes at Jack and dudes
off a mouth kissing.

5282
02:10:00,420 --> 02:10:02,710
I'd want to just give them the tickets
or whatever the fuck they're getting.

5283
02:10:02,711 --> 02:10:03,011
What do they,

5284
02:10:03,011 --> 02:10:03,800
what would they be?

5285
02:10:03,800 --> 02:10:08,150
It was only like $1,200 and they got
to the point though where it got so

5286
02:10:08,151 --> 02:10:10,100
horrible that their wives were,

5287
02:10:10,101 --> 02:10:10,401
yeah.

5288
02:10:10,401 --> 02:10:12,260
The two guys tapped out and
the other two were like,

5289
02:10:12,261 --> 02:10:14,570
I'm in it to deal with that.

5290
02:10:14,870 --> 02:10:15,651
Most of them were like,

5291
02:10:15,651 --> 02:10:16,401
this is hilarious.

5292
02:10:16,401 --> 02:10:16,911
This is funny.

5293
02:10:16,911 --> 02:10:19,430
A couple of 'em got creeped out like
I've never even seen porn before.

5294
02:10:19,431 --> 02:10:22,820
And then I see my husband
do it and all right,

5295
02:10:22,821 --> 02:10:23,510
the clear the palate.

5296
02:10:23,510 --> 02:10:24,350
Have you seen this though?

5297
02:10:24,360 --> 02:10:25,820
The happy elephant?

5298
02:10:26,050 --> 02:10:26,750
What this is,

5299
02:10:26,750 --> 02:10:27,583
I've seen,

5300
02:10:27,650 --> 02:10:29,210
it's like one of the best videos ever.

5301
02:10:29,240 --> 02:10:29,720
I go,

5302
02:10:29,720 --> 02:10:30,800
if you go onto youtube and look at it,

5303
02:10:30,920 --> 02:10:34,510
it's just an elephant that's having
fun in the ocean and it's like charging

5304
02:10:34,510 --> 02:10:35,710
waves and it's like,

5305
02:10:35,950 --> 02:10:38,050
it's like he's just having
the time of his life.

5306
02:10:38,051 --> 02:10:39,790
It is it just a super positive

5307
02:10:41,070 --> 02:10:44,210
animal because they're really intelligent
and they have an amazing memory.

5308
02:10:44,211 --> 02:10:44,421
You know,

5309
02:10:44,421 --> 02:10:45,254
always people,

5310
02:10:45,620 --> 02:10:49,460
they make that sort of a connection
to elephants and memories.

5311
02:10:49,461 --> 02:10:50,990
But you know,

5312
02:10:50,991 --> 02:10:55,460
because one of the ways to train an
elephant as you tie them to a something to

5313
02:10:55,461 --> 02:10:58,640
their leg and you put a stake in the
ground when they're young and they don't

5314
02:10:58,641 --> 02:11:01,850
have any strength and they always
remember that they can't move that steak.

5315
02:11:01,851 --> 02:11:04,130
So even though they get big
and they're much stronger,

5316
02:11:04,131 --> 02:11:05,180
they can easily pull free.

5317
02:11:05,181 --> 02:11:07,430
They don't because they
sort of remember that.

5318
02:11:07,790 --> 02:11:09,650
But they've done these,

5319
02:11:09,651 --> 02:11:13,400
a reintroductions of elephants that
haven't seen each other for over 20 years

5320
02:11:13,700 --> 02:11:14,630
and they go crazy.

5321
02:11:14,631 --> 02:11:16,910
They run rug and grab each other.

5322
02:11:16,911 --> 02:11:18,290
They recognize each other right away.

5323
02:11:18,650 --> 02:11:21,770
Even though the US fucking elephants
all basically look the same.

5324
02:11:24,960 --> 02:11:29,770
Totally speciesist end because they
ended up shooting it cause it was on a

5325
02:11:29,771 --> 02:11:30,604
resort.

5326
02:11:32,180 --> 02:11:37,180
You Imagine Ted Nugent comes out riding
a buffalo and puts one in the silence.

5327
02:11:37,720 --> 02:11:37,941
Yeah.

5328
02:11:37,941 --> 02:11:38,471
I watched his,

5329
02:11:38,471 --> 02:11:38,981
one of his,

5330
02:11:38,981 --> 02:11:39,370
uh,

5331
02:11:39,370 --> 02:11:40,840
hunting shows where you shot an elephant.

5332
02:11:40,841 --> 02:11:41,141
And I'm like,

5333
02:11:41,141 --> 02:11:41,531
wow,

5334
02:11:41,531 --> 02:11:41,831
really?

5335
02:11:41,831 --> 02:11:42,664
Dude.

5336
02:11:43,510 --> 02:11:46,420
And they were talking about how it's
important to shoot elephants because

5337
02:11:46,421 --> 02:11:47,440
there's too many of them now.

5338
02:11:47,490 --> 02:11:48,240
Yeah.

5339
02:11:48,240 --> 02:11:48,561
Cause,

5340
02:11:48,561 --> 02:11:49,200
uh,

5341
02:11:49,200 --> 02:11:51,600
they're destructive to the
environment and they're crowded out.

5342
02:11:51,601 --> 02:11:51,811
Yeah.

5343
02:11:51,811 --> 02:11:52,810
They have to call the herd.

5344
02:11:52,830 --> 02:11:53,310
They do.

5345
02:11:53,310 --> 02:11:54,450
Nobody wants to hear that though.

5346
02:11:54,910 --> 02:11:55,220
You know?

5347
02:11:55,220 --> 02:11:56,220
I know it's tough,

5348
02:11:56,950 --> 02:11:57,701
dear thing too.

5349
02:11:57,701 --> 02:11:59,030
Like I've had conversation with people,

5350
02:11:59,050 --> 02:12:00,490
but deer and,

5351
02:12:00,491 --> 02:12:00,701
uh,

5352
02:12:00,701 --> 02:12:01,241
they're like,

5353
02:12:01,241 --> 02:12:01,421
well,

5354
02:12:01,421 --> 02:12:02,860
I don't think I could ever shoot a deer.

5355
02:12:02,861 --> 02:12:05,470
And I don't think I support hunting
because you could always just like,

5356
02:12:05,471 --> 02:12:05,771
listen,

5357
02:12:05,771 --> 02:12:07,630
we're raising cattle for food.

5358
02:12:07,810 --> 02:12:08,890
You should just see cattle.

5359
02:12:09,880 --> 02:12:10,271
Okay.

5360
02:12:10,271 --> 02:12:12,670
But they gonna fuck
those deer going to fuck.

5361
02:12:12,750 --> 02:12:13,770
And then what happens?

5362
02:12:13,880 --> 02:12:14,450
Well,

5363
02:12:14,450 --> 02:12:15,180
you know,

5364
02:12:15,180 --> 02:12:16,380
we're raising every lane.

5365
02:12:16,381 --> 02:12:16,771
Basically,

5366
02:12:16,771 --> 02:12:17,610
we're raising everything.

5367
02:12:17,611 --> 02:12:17,761
You know,

5368
02:12:17,761 --> 02:12:18,810
we're raising deer to,

5369
02:12:18,811 --> 02:12:19,201
you know,

5370
02:12:19,201 --> 02:12:20,460
just a little more indirectly.

5371
02:12:20,461 --> 02:12:20,810
Yeah.

5372
02:12:20,810 --> 02:12:22,200
And certainly like the,

5373
02:12:22,830 --> 02:12:23,071
you know,

5374
02:12:23,071 --> 02:12:26,850
the elk population out did some elk
hunting in Colorado for the book and that,

5375
02:12:26,880 --> 02:12:27,713
you know,

5376
02:12:27,900 --> 02:12:29,070
you have to kill,

5377
02:12:29,230 --> 02:12:29,910
you know,

5378
02:12:29,910 --> 02:12:31,080
killing females is,

5379
02:12:31,260 --> 02:12:32,460
there's more females in math,

5380
02:12:32,490 --> 02:12:33,211
like a lot more.

5381
02:12:33,211 --> 02:12:33,661
So they need,

5382
02:12:33,661 --> 02:12:36,750
they're trying to keep the herd and
balance and it's important what you really

5383
02:12:36,751 --> 02:12:38,940
should do if you're going
hunting is killed babies.

5384
02:12:39,180 --> 02:12:39,900
Whoa.

5385
02:12:39,900 --> 02:12:43,530
Because they might not survive the winter
anyway and that meets just going to

5386
02:12:43,531 --> 02:12:43,831
waste.

5387
02:12:43,831 --> 02:12:44,461
They're rotting in that.

5388
02:12:44,461 --> 02:12:45,540
So use your tag.

5389
02:12:45,650 --> 02:12:46,081
It's really,

5390
02:12:46,081 --> 02:12:46,980
that's really hard to do.

5391
02:12:46,981 --> 02:12:47,761
But kill Bambi.

5392
02:12:47,761 --> 02:12:48,594
Right.

5393
02:12:48,840 --> 02:12:49,201
That's the,

5394
02:12:49,201 --> 02:12:50,190
that's the real tough one.

5395
02:12:50,250 --> 02:12:51,083
That's what you should do.

5396
02:12:51,360 --> 02:12:52,110
Yeah.

5397
02:12:52,110 --> 02:12:52,561
Again,

5398
02:12:52,561 --> 02:12:54,240
on the Ted Nugent saw or some he,

5399
02:12:54,241 --> 02:12:57,360
cause he would bow and Arrow hunts
and I don't know like what limits,

5400
02:12:57,361 --> 02:12:58,250
there are tagged limits,

5401
02:12:58,260 --> 02:12:59,970
but he shot three deer in a day.

5402
02:13:00,330 --> 02:13:01,000
I Dunno.

5403
02:13:01,000 --> 02:13:03,170
Thought maybe it's on his own property.

5404
02:13:03,190 --> 02:13:04,380
It is on his own property.

5405
02:13:04,410 --> 02:13:04,980
I don't know.

5406
02:13:04,980 --> 02:13:05,850
But I guess he's,

5407
02:13:05,851 --> 02:13:06,930
maybe he's doing,

5408
02:13:07,200 --> 02:13:07,670
you know,

5409
02:13:07,670 --> 02:13:09,410
like a population management.

5410
02:13:09,690 --> 02:13:11,750
So one of them was like this little baby,

5411
02:13:11,751 --> 02:13:12,980
they jack with a polling out.

5412
02:13:12,981 --> 02:13:13,251
I'm like,

5413
02:13:13,251 --> 02:13:14,030
whoa.

5414
02:13:14,030 --> 02:13:14,420
Yeah.

5415
02:13:14,420 --> 02:13:17,900
Actually bowhunting somebody I'd like
to get into because it's so hard and not

5416
02:13:17,901 --> 02:13:18,380
deer,

5417
02:13:18,380 --> 02:13:19,550
not like sitting in a stand,

5418
02:13:19,551 --> 02:13:20,600
which is a lot of deer hunting,

5419
02:13:20,601 --> 02:13:21,950
but like elk hunting,

5420
02:13:21,951 --> 02:13:24,020
which is you have to pursue,

5421
02:13:24,050 --> 02:13:25,250
you have to like track,

5422
02:13:25,251 --> 02:13:26,420
you'd have to like close.

5423
02:13:26,421 --> 02:13:29,930
I'll shoot it with 15 2030 yards,

5424
02:13:29,931 --> 02:13:30,764
you know,

5425
02:13:31,440 --> 02:13:32,041
as opposed to,

5426
02:13:32,041 --> 02:13:32,460
you know,

5427
02:13:32,460 --> 02:13:32,911
a hundred,

5428
02:13:32,911 --> 02:13:33,590
200 yards

5429
02:13:33,590 --> 02:13:36,050
and you got to do it most
of the time by herself.

5430
02:13:36,051 --> 02:13:36,430
Right.

5431
02:13:36,430 --> 02:13:40,790
And the guide who can close now it's
more sense you're making a mess,

5432
02:13:40,791 --> 02:13:41,010
you know,

5433
02:13:41,010 --> 02:13:41,843
so your,

5434
02:13:42,110 --> 02:13:42,861
your survival,

5435
02:13:42,861 --> 02:13:45,130
your chances are more better
than more people you like.

5436
02:13:45,230 --> 02:13:48,500
That's why it's really hard to
watch elk bow hunting on TV.

5437
02:13:48,530 --> 02:13:49,730
Cause you've got to have a camera man.

5438
02:13:49,731 --> 02:13:51,070
They're fucking everything up.

5439
02:13:51,170 --> 02:13:54,080
Cameron stomping on twigs
and shit about the new guy.

5440
02:13:54,400 --> 02:13:55,620
That was my dog.

5441
02:13:55,820 --> 02:13:57,980
Snap and the phone goes off,

5442
02:13:59,210 --> 02:14:00,260
ears pop up and it's like,

5443
02:14:00,261 --> 02:14:00,801
fuck this,

5444
02:14:00,801 --> 02:14:01,634
I'm out of here man.

5445
02:14:02,330 --> 02:14:02,630
Yeah.

5446
02:14:02,630 --> 02:14:04,290
Elk is a gigantic animals.

5447
02:14:04,880 --> 02:14:07,370
I don't think a lot of people
realize how big they are,

5448
02:14:07,371 --> 02:14:08,061
but there was,

5449
02:14:08,061 --> 02:14:08,610
um,

5450
02:14:08,610 --> 02:14:10,790
a lodge that we stayed in and,

5451
02:14:10,791 --> 02:14:10,920
uh,

5452
02:14:10,920 --> 02:14:14,060
they had an elk head on
the wall and the horns,

5453
02:14:14,210 --> 02:14:15,500
they're longer than my arm.

5454
02:14:15,920 --> 02:14:16,221
I mean,

5455
02:14:16,221 --> 02:14:17,320
literally it's,

5456
02:14:17,630 --> 02:14:18,980
this thing was massive,

5457
02:14:19,310 --> 02:14:20,061
like a 12,

5458
02:14:20,061 --> 02:14:21,590
1300 pound animal.

5459
02:14:21,591 --> 02:14:22,180
Yeah.

5460
02:14:22,180 --> 02:14:22,310
I,

5461
02:14:22,310 --> 02:14:22,530
you know,

5462
02:14:22,530 --> 02:14:27,460
I got a female elk for this book
and she was 600 pounds and it was,

5463
02:14:27,461 --> 02:14:27,731
yeah,

5464
02:14:27,731 --> 02:14:27,990
it was,

5465
02:14:27,990 --> 02:14:30,640
was Christ 600 pounds.

5466
02:14:30,641 --> 02:14:31,660
How much we meet was that,

5467
02:14:32,180 --> 02:14:32,950
you know,

5468
02:14:32,950 --> 02:14:33,161
it was,

5469
02:14:33,161 --> 02:14:33,610
I dunno,

5470
02:14:33,610 --> 02:14:34,450
I think I had brought home,

5471
02:14:34,480 --> 02:14:34,871
I don't know,

5472
02:14:34,871 --> 02:14:35,441
I didn't let you know,

5473
02:14:35,441 --> 02:14:36,550
but a lot.

5474
02:14:36,580 --> 02:14:36,820
Yeah.

5475
02:14:36,820 --> 02:14:37,151
Three,

5476
02:14:37,151 --> 02:14:37,690
400,

5477
02:14:37,690 --> 02:14:37,931
you know,

5478
02:14:37,931 --> 02:14:38,350
I don't know.

5479
02:14:38,350 --> 02:14:39,970
At that point I want you to be 300,

5480
02:14:39,971 --> 02:14:40,960
250 pounds of meat.

5481
02:14:41,110 --> 02:14:42,670
Did you stalk it?

5482
02:14:42,671 --> 02:14:43,380
Like how did you,

5483
02:14:43,380 --> 02:14:43,660
yeah,

5484
02:14:43,660 --> 02:14:43,871
yeah,

5485
02:14:43,871 --> 02:14:44,171
he hit the,

5486
02:14:44,171 --> 02:14:47,620
you have to like basically elk hunting
and where I wasn't southern Colorado,

5487
02:14:47,621 --> 02:14:49,960
you have to look essentially run.

5488
02:14:50,020 --> 02:14:51,340
Like it's because,

5489
02:14:51,680 --> 02:14:51,990
uh,

5490
02:14:51,990 --> 02:14:54,790
there are only coming out
at a very specific time and,

5491
02:14:55,150 --> 02:14:55,391
uh,

5492
02:14:55,391 --> 02:14:58,540
your scent is so
destructive to the they'll,

5493
02:14:58,541 --> 02:14:59,374
they'll take there,

5494
02:14:59,490 --> 02:15:00,221
they smell you at all.

5495
02:15:00,221 --> 02:15:00,850
They're going to be,

5496
02:15:00,850 --> 02:15:02,440
they're going to take
off and never come back.

5497
02:15:02,710 --> 02:15:04,810
So you don't go out and told their out.

5498
02:15:05,020 --> 02:15:06,340
You don't like go wait for him,

5499
02:15:06,370 --> 02:15:06,851
which is what,

5500
02:15:06,851 --> 02:15:07,180
you know,

5501
02:15:07,180 --> 02:15:08,350
like deer hunting is more,

5502
02:15:08,351 --> 02:15:13,351
you get in a blind and wait for him that
you actually look where they are and go

5503
02:15:13,511 --> 02:15:15,580
up and sneak around and you know,

5504
02:15:15,840 --> 02:15:18,620
I can run through the bushes taking into
account where the wind's blowing and he

5505
02:15:18,621 --> 02:15:19,140
tried to hunt,

5506
02:15:19,140 --> 02:15:19,851
hunt the wind.

5507
02:15:19,851 --> 02:15:22,300
So you have the wind blown with you.

5508
02:15:22,360 --> 02:15:23,193
And uh,

5509
02:15:24,130 --> 02:15:24,671
and uh,

5510
02:15:24,671 --> 02:15:25,151
yeah,

5511
02:15:25,151 --> 02:15:25,651
I uh,

5512
02:15:25,651 --> 02:15:29,720
I was with Don Yeager who is
chuck Yeager son Chuck Yeager's,

5513
02:15:29,740 --> 02:15:31,180
like the fighter fighter pilot,

5514
02:15:31,190 --> 02:15:31,430
the rope,

5515
02:15:31,430 --> 02:15:33,130
the speed of sound iconic.

5516
02:15:33,170 --> 02:15:34,003
Wow.

5517
02:15:35,480 --> 02:15:36,313
Um,

5518
02:15:37,490 --> 02:15:38,323
whose was it?

5519
02:15:38,860 --> 02:15:39,693
Bigger?

5520
02:15:39,790 --> 02:15:41,830
So Don Yeager who was a Vietnam vet,

5521
02:15:41,831 --> 02:15:43,570
it was a appointment in Vietnam.

5522
02:15:44,080 --> 02:15:44,913
Um,

5523
02:15:44,950 --> 02:15:45,490
and uh,

5524
02:15:45,490 --> 02:15:46,540
we've become friends,

5525
02:15:46,900 --> 02:15:47,770
long story,

5526
02:15:47,771 --> 02:15:48,281
that whole thing.

5527
02:15:48,281 --> 02:15:49,150
But he and his son,

5528
02:15:49,180 --> 02:15:51,550
his son is like a big hunter.

5529
02:15:51,550 --> 02:15:51,971
And also,

5530
02:15:51,971 --> 02:15:52,720
uh,

5531
02:15:52,720 --> 02:15:53,500
uh,

5532
02:15:53,500 --> 02:15:53,800
uh,

5533
02:15:53,800 --> 02:15:55,360
Iraq and Afghanistan vet.

5534
02:15:55,550 --> 02:15:56,383
Wow.

5535
02:15:56,920 --> 02:15:57,281
And,

5536
02:15:57,281 --> 02:15:57,521
you know,

5537
02:15:57,521 --> 02:15:58,354
they were in the,

5538
02:15:58,450 --> 02:15:59,231
in the trenches,

5539
02:15:59,231 --> 02:16:00,790
vets not all told.

5540
02:16:00,791 --> 02:16:03,580
How many different experiences did
you go through to write this book?

5541
02:16:03,820 --> 02:16:04,450
I don't know.

5542
02:16:04,450 --> 02:16:05,920
10 something like that.

5543
02:16:05,921 --> 02:16:06,161
You know.

5544
02:16:06,161 --> 02:16:07,270
So I did,

5545
02:16:07,580 --> 02:16:08,920
I tried what I tried to do with sort of,

5546
02:16:08,921 --> 02:16:09,310
you know,

5547
02:16:09,310 --> 02:16:14,310
have fun with it and keep it light and
in interesting and not dire and sincere

5548
02:16:15,190 --> 02:16:19,600
and sort of answer all your
survival scenario needs.

5549
02:16:19,601 --> 02:16:20,740
Like what if it's Mad Max?

5550
02:16:20,741 --> 02:16:20,891
Well,

5551
02:16:20,891 --> 02:16:22,270
I did a stunt driving school,

5552
02:16:22,290 --> 02:16:22,510
you know,

5553
02:16:22,510 --> 02:16:22,780
and I'm like,

5554
02:16:22,780 --> 02:16:25,210
what are some of the things about
stunt driving you didn't know?

5555
02:16:25,510 --> 02:16:25,721
Like,

5556
02:16:25,721 --> 02:16:25,841
you know,

5557
02:16:25,841 --> 02:16:27,940
you fixed the brakes so
you can pump the brake.

5558
02:16:28,120 --> 02:16:31,650
So getting the rear to lock is
how you do all those tricks.

5559
02:16:31,651 --> 02:16:36,090
So how you bust a one 80 and all that
stuff is by pumping the brake and they fix

5560
02:16:36,091 --> 02:16:37,710
it so you can pump it
like a break or you know,

5561
02:16:37,711 --> 02:16:39,030
even the one that you step on.

5562
02:16:39,900 --> 02:16:40,381
And,

5563
02:16:40,381 --> 02:16:41,214
um,

5564
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:42,241
and then,

5565
02:16:42,241 --> 02:16:42,391
you know,

5566
02:16:42,391 --> 02:16:47,391
I did stuff like I stole a kind of
learned how to steal old cars with la La

5567
02:16:47,400 --> 02:16:48,220
Gangbangers,

5568
02:16:48,220 --> 02:16:49,010
loose cars,

5569
02:16:49,010 --> 02:16:49,830
you know,

5570
02:16:49,830 --> 02:16:50,281
and you know,

5571
02:16:50,281 --> 02:16:52,140
you can't steal anything recent,

5572
02:16:52,200 --> 02:16:52,740
recent,

5573
02:16:52,740 --> 02:16:53,011
you know,

5574
02:16:53,011 --> 02:16:54,300
but older cohort years,

5575
02:16:54,301 --> 02:16:55,620
like a good year to start stealing,

5576
02:16:55,760 --> 02:16:56,270
you know,

5577
02:16:56,270 --> 02:16:56,931
and like,

5578
02:16:56,931 --> 02:16:57,150
you know,

5579
02:16:57,150 --> 02:16:58,440
a 93 civics.

5580
02:16:58,590 --> 02:16:59,000
Great.

5581
02:16:59,000 --> 02:16:59,460
You know what I mean?

5582
02:16:59,460 --> 02:16:59,611
Yeah.

5583
02:16:59,611 --> 02:17:00,450
You just go in MPs.

5584
02:17:00,500 --> 02:17:00,760
Yeah.

5585
02:17:00,760 --> 02:17:01,650
Pop off all the,

5586
02:17:01,651 --> 02:17:05,340
all of us basically you pop off the stuff
from the steering column and you reach

5587
02:17:05,341 --> 02:17:07,110
in there with like a leatherman and we're,

5588
02:17:07,111 --> 02:17:08,310
or needle nose and just,

5589
02:17:08,340 --> 02:17:10,950
it turns out key really is that easy.

5590
02:17:11,190 --> 02:17:11,401
Yeah.

5591
02:17:11,401 --> 02:17:12,720
And then you sign it for GM cars.

5592
02:17:12,721 --> 02:17:13,171
He's size,

5593
02:17:13,171 --> 02:17:14,580
which I missed something in the column,

5594
02:17:15,420 --> 02:17:15,841
but you know,

5595
02:17:15,841 --> 02:17:16,471
anything after,

5596
02:17:16,471 --> 02:17:17,304
you know,

5597
02:17:17,310 --> 02:17:22,260
they have like electronic fail safes
and shut offs and chips in the keys and

5598
02:17:22,261 --> 02:17:22,710
stuff like that.

5599
02:17:22,710 --> 02:17:25,110
Did this book writing this book
changed the way you live your life?

5600
02:17:26,160 --> 02:17:26,410
Yeah,

5601
02:17:26,410 --> 02:17:26,970
little,

5602
02:17:26,970 --> 02:17:28,570
I learned a lot.

5603
02:17:28,650 --> 02:17:28,831
I mean,

5604
02:17:28,831 --> 02:17:30,420
it was just so much stuff I didn't,

5605
02:17:30,450 --> 02:17:31,620
I was just stunned,

5606
02:17:31,650 --> 02:17:31,891
you know?

5607
02:17:31,891 --> 02:17:34,650
And it really became like
mythbusters for a lot of things.

5608
02:17:34,651 --> 02:17:34,861
You know,

5609
02:17:34,861 --> 02:17:36,600
things I thought were true weren't true,

5610
02:17:36,601 --> 02:17:40,770
like about what I thought it'd be able
to do or what the realities of certain

5611
02:17:40,771 --> 02:17:41,790
situations were.

5612
02:17:41,820 --> 02:17:42,810
What was the most shocking?

5613
02:17:44,150 --> 02:17:47,340
Probably the stress when really was the
most mind blowing and really changed the

5614
02:17:47,341 --> 02:17:49,740
way I think about myself,

5615
02:17:49,830 --> 02:17:50,280
you know,

5616
02:17:50,280 --> 02:17:51,070
and what I can do,

5617
02:17:51,070 --> 02:17:52,710
why can't do and,

5618
02:17:52,711 --> 02:17:53,071
but you know,

5619
02:17:53,071 --> 02:17:53,904
there was,

5620
02:17:54,840 --> 02:17:55,411
I don't even know,

5621
02:17:55,411 --> 02:17:55,960
you know this,

5622
02:17:55,960 --> 02:17:56,520
it's just,

5623
02:17:56,520 --> 02:17:58,380
it all goes into the mix of like,

5624
02:17:58,410 --> 02:17:58,650
you know,

5625
02:17:58,650 --> 02:17:59,940
trying to understand the world,

5626
02:17:59,970 --> 02:18:00,430
you know,

5627
02:18:00,430 --> 02:18:01,770
which is what basically
what I'm trying to do.

5628
02:18:01,900 --> 02:18:05,290
One of the things that I've thought was
really fascinating was that this book,

5629
02:18:05,980 --> 02:18:10,980
a lot of it seemed to emanate from where
you grew up and you grow up in a town

5630
02:18:12,251 --> 02:18:13,360
in Massachusetts.

5631
02:18:14,210 --> 02:18:18,330
It explained the story that they
were attacked by the Indians.

5632
02:18:18,600 --> 02:18:20,990
Hatchet marks on the fucking houses still

5633
02:18:20,990 --> 02:18:21,261
there.

5634
02:18:21,261 --> 02:18:21,531
Right.

5635
02:18:21,531 --> 02:18:23,840
So I grew up in a town
called old Deerfield mass,

5636
02:18:23,841 --> 02:18:25,370
which is like a little
bit like Sturbridge,

5637
02:18:25,371 --> 02:18:26,130
like it's partial,

5638
02:18:26,130 --> 02:18:28,070
half the town is his museum.

5639
02:18:28,430 --> 02:18:30,860
And because it was very famously at 17,

5640
02:18:30,861 --> 02:18:31,290
oh four,

5641
02:18:31,290 --> 02:18:32,720
the Indians and French,

5642
02:18:33,250 --> 02:18:33,890
uh,

5643
02:18:33,890 --> 02:18:38,570
came down from Canada and massacred the
whole town and marched off 150 captives

5644
02:18:38,600 --> 02:18:40,460
in the winter all the way up to Canada.

5645
02:18:41,570 --> 02:18:41,931
And,

5646
02:18:41,931 --> 02:18:42,081
you know,

5647
02:18:42,081 --> 02:18:43,760
a lot of them made it and it was crazy,

5648
02:18:43,761 --> 02:18:44,001
but,

5649
02:18:44,001 --> 02:18:44,480
um,

5650
02:18:44,480 --> 02:18:45,313
people were tough.

5651
02:18:45,540 --> 02:18:45,831
You know,

5652
02:18:45,831 --> 02:18:46,311
it's again,

5653
02:18:46,311 --> 02:18:50,180
like you can't even compare
the toughness from 1702 to now,

5654
02:18:50,240 --> 02:18:50,511
you know,

5655
02:18:50,511 --> 02:18:50,811
but,

5656
02:18:50,811 --> 02:18:50,961
but,

5657
02:18:50,961 --> 02:18:51,260
uh,

5658
02:18:51,260 --> 02:18:51,711
but yeah,

5659
02:18:51,711 --> 02:18:53,420
and so I grew up in this town where,

5660
02:18:54,170 --> 02:18:54,501
you know,

5661
02:18:54,501 --> 02:18:56,000
there were a lot of,

5662
02:18:57,500 --> 02:19:00,770
the Indians had to act a whole and the
store and shot the guy through the door.

5663
02:19:00,771 --> 02:19:00,861
And,

5664
02:19:00,861 --> 02:19:00,981
you know,

5665
02:19:00,981 --> 02:19:04,850
these stories are kind of what I grew up
with and they'd even do recreation's as

5666
02:19:04,851 --> 02:19:05,150
a kid.

5667
02:19:05,150 --> 02:19:05,721
I remember like,

5668
02:19:05,721 --> 02:19:05,901
you know,

5669
02:19:05,901 --> 02:19:10,880
guys as Indians are screaming in the
night running around and killing other

5670
02:19:10,881 --> 02:19:13,520
people that were dressed as colonials,

5671
02:19:13,521 --> 02:19:13,821
you know,

5672
02:19:13,821 --> 02:19:16,490
and like when you're in a
recreation in a recreation,

5673
02:19:16,491 --> 02:19:17,200
but when you're like,

5674
02:19:17,200 --> 02:19:17,450
you know,

5675
02:19:17,450 --> 02:19:18,350
five years old,

5676
02:19:18,650 --> 02:19:19,790
that shit sticks.

5677
02:19:19,791 --> 02:19:20,331
You know what I mean?

5678
02:19:20,331 --> 02:19:20,991
That goes deep.

5679
02:19:20,991 --> 02:19:21,530
So like,

5680
02:19:21,530 --> 02:19:22,850
I think I definitely,

5681
02:19:23,270 --> 02:19:26,180
I kind of realized in
this book that I was like,

5682
02:19:26,800 --> 02:19:31,800
kind of preparing for the Indians to
come over the wall and certain with my

5683
02:19:31,991 --> 02:19:32,501
whole life,

5684
02:19:32,501 --> 02:19:32,981
you know what I mean?

5685
02:19:32,981 --> 02:19:33,371
With like,

5686
02:19:33,371 --> 02:19:33,581
you know,

5687
02:19:33,581 --> 02:19:34,870
with the fighting stuff and with,

5688
02:19:34,900 --> 02:19:35,230
uh,

5689
02:19:35,230 --> 02:19:35,861
with everything,

5690
02:19:35,861 --> 02:19:36,230
you know?

5691
02:19:36,230 --> 02:19:36,861
Yeah.

5692
02:19:36,861 --> 02:19:37,940
I loved that.

5693
02:19:38,360 --> 02:19:40,430
That realization that you had in the book,

5694
02:19:40,431 --> 02:19:40,671
I thought,

5695
02:19:40,671 --> 02:19:43,940
I found it really fascinating and I just
couldn't imagine what it must be like

5696
02:19:43,941 --> 02:19:48,890
growing up in a town where there's real
clear evidence of the hatchet marks on

5697
02:19:48,891 --> 02:19:49,950
doors and shit.

5698
02:19:49,951 --> 02:19:50,650
Yeah.

5699
02:19:50,650 --> 02:19:50,900
Yeah.

5700
02:19:50,900 --> 02:19:51,091
I mean,

5701
02:19:51,091 --> 02:19:51,990
you knew it was,

5702
02:19:51,991 --> 02:19:52,824
it was a long time.

5703
02:19:52,840 --> 02:19:53,340
It was right,

5704
02:19:53,340 --> 02:19:55,170
but still is a little kid.

5705
02:19:55,171 --> 02:19:55,950
You're like,

5706
02:19:55,950 --> 02:19:58,410
I would wake up and there was
cornfields and I'd be like,

5707
02:19:58,411 --> 02:19:59,460
are they come through the corn?

5708
02:19:59,461 --> 02:19:59,850
Dude,

5709
02:19:59,850 --> 02:20:00,541
I do like,

5710
02:20:00,541 --> 02:20:00,811
you know,

5711
02:20:00,811 --> 02:20:01,950
and that they came in the winter,

5712
02:20:01,951 --> 02:20:02,191
you know,

5713
02:20:02,191 --> 02:20:03,001
it was ridiculous,

5714
02:20:03,001 --> 02:20:03,601
but you still,

5715
02:20:03,601 --> 02:20:04,440
it gets into your,

5716
02:20:04,441 --> 02:20:04,710
you know,

5717
02:20:04,710 --> 02:20:05,490
these things.

5718
02:20:05,490 --> 02:20:06,021
And again,

5719
02:20:06,021 --> 02:20:08,010
you were simple animals.

5720
02:20:08,011 --> 02:20:08,191
You know,

5721
02:20:08,191 --> 02:20:09,510
you're afraid of things.

5722
02:20:09,930 --> 02:20:12,480
You're not sophisticated on
how you deal with your fear.

5723
02:20:12,490 --> 02:20:16,410
You think you are and you
see a movie about something,

5724
02:20:16,500 --> 02:20:17,550
you believe it man.

5725
02:20:17,551 --> 02:20:18,690
And like you can say,

5726
02:20:18,691 --> 02:20:18,901
oh,

5727
02:20:18,901 --> 02:20:19,471
it's just move.

5728
02:20:19,471 --> 02:20:21,780
But you know what a big
party you does not know.

5729
02:20:21,781 --> 02:20:22,561
That's just a movie,

5730
02:20:22,561 --> 02:20:23,161
a big party.

5731
02:20:23,161 --> 02:20:28,161
You thinks huge sharks are in the water
and they will always think that because

5732
02:20:28,241 --> 02:20:28,600
the jaw,

5733
02:20:28,600 --> 02:20:29,433
you know what I mean?

5734
02:20:30,160 --> 02:20:30,500
There's a,

5735
02:20:30,500 --> 02:20:30,851
there's a,

5736
02:20:30,851 --> 02:20:31,211
there's a,

5737
02:20:31,211 --> 02:20:33,520
there's a deceit that
goes on when people all,

5738
02:20:33,540 --> 02:20:34,373
it's just a movie.

5739
02:20:34,420 --> 02:20:35,050
I'm not fooled,

5740
02:20:35,050 --> 02:20:36,010
but you are fooled.

5741
02:20:36,280 --> 02:20:36,701
Yeah.

5742
02:20:36,701 --> 02:20:39,940
Sorta at some level.

5743
02:20:40,180 --> 02:20:42,370
On some level you believe it's possible.

5744
02:20:42,450 --> 02:20:42,841
Yeah.

5745
02:20:42,841 --> 02:20:43,890
On some level,

5746
02:20:43,920 --> 02:20:44,251
yeah.

5747
02:20:44,251 --> 02:20:45,084
It's um,

5748
02:20:45,500 --> 02:20:45,780
the,

5749
02:20:45,780 --> 02:20:50,370
the idea of living in a place where
you knew massacres took place.

5750
02:20:50,610 --> 02:20:52,440
Was Your town supposedly haunted?

5751
02:20:52,860 --> 02:20:53,161
Oh yeah.

5752
02:20:53,161 --> 02:20:53,510
There we go.

5753
02:20:53,510 --> 02:20:54,301
Surfing and stuff like that.

5754
02:20:54,301 --> 02:20:55,500
I never dealt with any of them,

5755
02:20:55,501 --> 02:20:56,520
but I had the people,

5756
02:20:56,710 --> 02:20:58,050
I had friends who had that conversation.

5757
02:20:58,051 --> 02:20:58,884
You believe in that?

5758
02:20:59,610 --> 02:21:01,440
Yes.

5759
02:21:01,760 --> 02:21:02,790
I've never seen it.

5760
02:21:02,970 --> 02:21:03,450
Right.

5761
02:21:03,450 --> 02:21:06,210
But I leave even like psychic
energy and stuff like that.

5762
02:21:06,211 --> 02:21:06,560
I mean,

5763
02:21:06,560 --> 02:21:06,870
listen,

5764
02:21:06,870 --> 02:21:10,560
I've been in places where I was
in an island in the Pacific.

5765
02:21:11,320 --> 02:21:12,000
Um,

5766
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:13,320
there was actually Malcolm Forbes,

5767
02:21:13,321 --> 02:21:14,400
his private island,

5768
02:21:14,490 --> 02:21:15,310
um,

5769
02:21:15,310 --> 02:21:15,530
did,

5770
02:21:15,530 --> 02:21:18,090
the guy was sailing with new,

5771
02:21:18,120 --> 02:21:20,340
somehow we stayed there and it had been,

5772
02:21:20,341 --> 02:21:21,150
um,

5773
02:21:21,150 --> 02:21:25,680
it was a small island near not too far
from Fiji and the Fijians had come in the

5774
02:21:25,680 --> 02:21:27,690
night over a hundred years and eaten.

5775
02:21:27,720 --> 02:21:31,140
Everybody on the island did declare war
on this island and eaten everybody off

5776
02:21:31,141 --> 02:21:31,974
the island.

5777
02:21:32,520 --> 02:21:35,820
And you could tell like some
shit had gone down there.

5778
02:21:35,821 --> 02:21:36,151
I like,

5779
02:21:36,151 --> 02:21:41,151
there was a quiet Erie bad juice there,

5780
02:21:42,510 --> 02:21:42,931
you know,

5781
02:21:42,931 --> 02:21:43,610
for sure.

5782
02:21:43,610 --> 02:21:44,331
And also like,

5783
02:21:44,331 --> 02:21:44,540
you know,

5784
02:21:44,540 --> 02:21:48,120
those towns because you
knew or because there's no,

5785
02:21:48,200 --> 02:21:49,030
maybe,

5786
02:21:49,030 --> 02:21:49,330
maybe,

5787
02:21:49,330 --> 02:21:50,450
I mean I could have been fooling myself,

5788
02:21:50,451 --> 02:21:51,200
but it was also like,

5789
02:21:51,200 --> 02:21:51,350
you know,

5790
02:21:51,350 --> 02:21:54,590
the Anasazi ruins and anyone
in New Mexico and stuff,

5791
02:21:54,620 --> 02:21:59,620
like I felt the same quietness there
that I kind of feel like there is,

5792
02:22:00,490 --> 02:22:01,960
there's so much we don't know.

5793
02:22:01,990 --> 02:22:04,000
I mean just know what you don't know.

5794
02:22:04,001 --> 02:22:05,770
I mean that's kind of like
my whole theory in life,

5795
02:22:05,771 --> 02:22:10,420
but there's a lot of that's out there
and I think there is psychic residue and

5796
02:22:10,421 --> 02:22:10,781
things like,

5797
02:22:10,781 --> 02:22:13,450
I mean people that go to
Auschwitz talk about it,

5798
02:22:13,451 --> 02:22:14,061
you know what I mean?

5799
02:22:14,061 --> 02:22:16,720
And I've never been and I'm
sure it would be something.

5800
02:22:17,010 --> 02:22:17,160
Yeah.

5801
02:22:17,160 --> 02:22:18,620
I wonder because the issue was always a,

5802
02:22:18,621 --> 02:22:18,921
you know,

5803
02:22:18,921 --> 02:22:19,820
you're going to Auschwitz.

5804
02:22:19,821 --> 02:22:20,330
Yeah.

5805
02:22:20,330 --> 02:22:21,250
But it's,

5806
02:22:21,310 --> 02:22:21,571
I,

5807
02:22:21,571 --> 02:22:22,480
I mean I'm not,

5808
02:22:22,481 --> 02:22:25,070
I'm not necessarily a skeptic as much.

5809
02:22:25,260 --> 02:22:28,050
I am just always asking questions.

5810
02:22:28,440 --> 02:22:29,310
But the,

5811
02:22:29,311 --> 02:22:29,640
um,

5812
02:22:29,640 --> 02:22:31,950
the psychic connection between people,

5813
02:22:32,100 --> 02:22:35,160
I've heard like arguments
about answering the phone.

5814
02:22:35,190 --> 02:22:35,371
Like,

5815
02:22:35,371 --> 02:22:37,710
do you know the no person's going to call
you thinking about them and then they

5816
02:22:37,711 --> 02:22:39,060
call you today.

5817
02:22:39,120 --> 02:22:41,310
I was hanging around with
a friend of mine and I was,

5818
02:22:42,050 --> 02:22:42,640
I stepped,

5819
02:22:42,640 --> 02:22:47,640
we opened this door and I had an a very
obscure lyric playing in my head to a

5820
02:22:48,181 --> 02:22:49,560
1970 song.

5821
02:22:49,740 --> 02:22:52,980
And this motherfucker behind
me starts singing it and I go,

5822
02:22:52,981 --> 02:22:54,420
why didn't you just sing that song?

5823
02:22:54,540 --> 02:22:54,901
And he goes,

5824
02:22:54,901 --> 02:22:55,411
it's a good song.

5825
02:22:55,411 --> 02:22:55,621
I go,

5826
02:22:55,621 --> 02:22:56,311
it's a good song.

5827
02:22:56,311 --> 02:22:56,521
I go,

5828
02:22:56,521 --> 02:22:57,580
why don't you just sing that song?

5829
02:22:57,581 --> 02:22:58,470
It goes that songs in my head,

5830
02:22:58,471 --> 02:22:58,651
I go,

5831
02:22:58,651 --> 02:23:03,630
I was singing the fucking words to that
song in my head before we walked through

5832
02:23:03,631 --> 02:23:03,910
the door.

5833
02:23:03,910 --> 02:23:05,370
You said the exact lyric.

5834
02:23:05,371 --> 02:23:08,910
I was thinking that could
be easily coincidence,

5835
02:23:08,911 --> 02:23:09,541
but God,

5836
02:23:09,541 --> 02:23:09,751
I mean,

5837
02:23:09,751 --> 02:23:11,980
it's a popular song
and it's a famous song.

5838
02:23:12,280 --> 02:23:13,650
There's things going on that you know,

5839
02:23:13,651 --> 02:23:14,131
like it's,

5840
02:23:14,131 --> 02:23:14,390
you know,

5841
02:23:14,390 --> 02:23:16,090
there's brainwaves and energy.

5842
02:23:16,130 --> 02:23:16,620
Yeah.

5843
02:23:16,620 --> 02:23:18,750
But we get like a Sam Harris
Dude in here who are like,

5844
02:23:18,751 --> 02:23:19,051
oh,

5845
02:23:19,051 --> 02:23:20,390
statistically it's like,

5846
02:23:20,391 --> 02:23:21,370
are the possibilities,

5847
02:23:21,371 --> 02:23:24,990
the probabilities and just luck and
you're connecting all the significance to

5848
02:23:24,991 --> 02:23:25,350
luck.

5849
02:23:25,350 --> 02:23:26,430
And it might be bright too.

5850
02:23:27,060 --> 02:23:27,481
I don't know.

5851
02:23:27,481 --> 02:23:27,961
But man,

5852
02:23:27,961 --> 02:23:32,100
it was freaking me out because I thought
the exact words that this guy was

5853
02:23:32,101 --> 02:23:36,480
singing behind me and they're from a
fucking song written for decades ago.

5854
02:23:37,160 --> 02:23:37,461
You know,

5855
02:23:37,461 --> 02:23:39,630
it's like there's been a lot
of songs between now and then.

5856
02:23:39,870 --> 02:23:40,651
That's kind of crazy.

5857
02:23:40,651 --> 02:23:41,484
So it give you,

5858
02:23:41,580 --> 02:23:41,851
yeah,

5859
02:23:41,851 --> 02:23:42,031
no,

5860
02:23:42,031 --> 02:23:45,420
I think there is a lot of
forms of communication that,

5861
02:23:45,450 --> 02:23:45,840
that,

5862
02:23:45,840 --> 02:23:46,440
you know,

5863
02:23:46,440 --> 02:23:47,221
emotionally,

5864
02:23:47,221 --> 02:23:48,300
pheromones sense.

5865
02:23:48,301 --> 02:23:51,210
You know what dogs are seeing
with dogs are hitting off of,

5866
02:23:51,430 --> 02:23:51,630
you know,

5867
02:23:51,630 --> 02:23:54,660
the cat that comes in lies down on
people two days before they die.

5868
02:23:54,661 --> 02:23:55,181
You know,

5869
02:23:55,181 --> 02:23:56,370
a creepy fucking cat.

5870
02:23:58,110 --> 02:23:59,900
He's sucking your soul out result.

5871
02:24:00,090 --> 02:24:03,120
Stupid knows there's smells you give
off when you're going to whatever.

5872
02:24:03,121 --> 02:24:03,954
But I think there's,

5873
02:24:03,980 --> 02:24:04,351
there's just,

5874
02:24:04,351 --> 02:24:04,531
you know,

5875
02:24:04,531 --> 02:24:07,910
this more than to the Earth
and heaven and hell are you?

5876
02:24:07,970 --> 02:24:12,350
Rupert Sheldrake believes that everything
has some sort of a memory or he's got

5877
02:24:12,351 --> 02:24:13,370
a theory about everything.

5878
02:24:13,371 --> 02:24:16,400
Having some sort of a memory and
that our ideas of memory are,

5879
02:24:16,760 --> 02:24:17,031
you know,

5880
02:24:17,031 --> 02:24:18,380
we think that memory is ours.

5881
02:24:18,470 --> 02:24:19,430
We have a memory,

5882
02:24:19,431 --> 02:24:21,080
animals have memory and that's it.

5883
02:24:21,530 --> 02:24:22,340
But what,

5884
02:24:22,340 --> 02:24:26,810
what he believes is that actual
objects may also contain some sort of

5885
02:24:26,811 --> 02:24:29,120
information about what's already
taking place in that area.

5886
02:24:29,600 --> 02:24:32,270
And that's one of the reasons why
when you go to historic places,

5887
02:24:32,271 --> 02:24:33,720
it gives you a strange feeling.

5888
02:24:33,800 --> 02:24:33,891
Well,

5889
02:24:33,891 --> 02:24:34,461
that's what I'm talking about.

5890
02:24:34,461 --> 02:24:34,700
Like,

5891
02:24:34,700 --> 02:24:35,150
yeah,

5892
02:24:35,150 --> 02:24:35,931
I'm not sure.

5893
02:24:35,931 --> 02:24:37,230
I'm not sure it's impossible.

5894
02:24:37,231 --> 02:24:41,720
Like if something really bad happened
somewhere that you might pick it up later.

5895
02:24:41,721 --> 02:24:42,350
I don't really know.

5896
02:24:42,350 --> 02:24:43,460
I think it's,

5897
02:24:44,340 --> 02:24:44,600
we're,

5898
02:24:44,600 --> 02:24:45,890
I think we're more sensitive.

5899
02:24:45,920 --> 02:24:46,191
You know,

5900
02:24:46,191 --> 02:24:47,290
there's a great book,

5901
02:24:47,390 --> 02:24:47,720
uh,

5902
02:24:47,720 --> 02:24:49,460
Gavin de Becker wrote the gift of fear,

5903
02:24:49,461 --> 02:24:50,660
which is all by intuition,

5904
02:24:50,661 --> 02:24:51,430
you know,

5905
02:24:51,430 --> 02:24:53,780
and you should trust your
intuition in certain situations.

5906
02:24:53,781 --> 02:24:53,991
You know,

5907
02:24:53,991 --> 02:24:54,171
like,

5908
02:24:54,171 --> 02:24:54,650
don't,

5909
02:24:54,650 --> 02:24:56,000
if somebody's freaking you out,

5910
02:24:56,600 --> 02:24:57,800
don't try to be nice to them.

5911
02:24:58,130 --> 02:24:58,671
You know what I mean?

5912
02:24:58,671 --> 02:24:59,061
Like there's,

5913
02:24:59,061 --> 02:25:01,490
there's a reason maybe you don't
see it and that right away,

5914
02:25:01,491 --> 02:25:03,080
but don't force yourself to be polite.

5915
02:25:03,081 --> 02:25:03,471
And anyway,

5916
02:25:03,471 --> 02:25:04,310
it's a cool book.

5917
02:25:04,470 --> 02:25:06,510
I am a big believer in that.

5918
02:25:06,780 --> 02:25:07,650
I don't know why,

5919
02:25:07,651 --> 02:25:12,210
but maybe because of my own personal
success with following that,

5920
02:25:12,540 --> 02:25:17,010
that I've trusted my intuition
like implicitly my entire life.

5921
02:25:17,040 --> 02:25:19,980
Like that's the one thing that I've
trusted my entire life that I don't think

5922
02:25:19,981 --> 02:25:20,814
it's ever fucked me.

5923
02:25:20,970 --> 02:25:21,241
Well,

5924
02:25:21,241 --> 02:25:23,250
the danger is when you
trust it for systems,

5925
02:25:23,400 --> 02:25:24,090
it can't that

5926
02:25:24,090 --> 02:25:24,840
that are too big.

5927
02:25:24,840 --> 02:25:25,110
Right?

5928
02:25:25,110 --> 02:25:28,350
But you're never going to run
into a 600 foot tall man on the,

5929
02:25:28,351 --> 02:25:28,591
you know,

5930
02:25:28,591 --> 02:25:29,424
that's never going to happen.

5931
02:25:29,640 --> 02:25:30,870
But you could in the stock market,

5932
02:25:31,140 --> 02:25:31,651
you know what you mean?

5933
02:25:31,651 --> 02:25:32,191
You couldn't,

5934
02:25:32,191 --> 02:25:32,731
you couldn't,

5935
02:25:32,731 --> 02:25:37,080
in other situations where it's impossible
to have a 600 that you're just not

5936
02:25:37,081 --> 02:25:37,690
ready for.

5937
02:25:37,690 --> 02:25:38,161
You know what I mean?

5938
02:25:38,161 --> 02:25:39,720
Your intuition is not good.

5939
02:25:39,960 --> 02:25:40,940
It's not designed for them.

5940
02:25:41,190 --> 02:25:44,790
Something as complex as
that system is just too big,

5941
02:25:44,810 --> 02:25:45,190
you know?

5942
02:25:45,190 --> 02:25:45,461
Yeah.

5943
02:25:45,461 --> 02:25:48,190
I think that's interesting because that's
sort of along the lines of what we've

5944
02:25:48,191 --> 02:25:51,100
been talking about is that our own
bodies are not designed for this world.

5945
02:25:51,101 --> 02:25:53,890
That we're living in the possibilities
that are created by the suburb we live

5946
02:25:53,891 --> 02:25:53,990
in.

5947
02:25:53,990 --> 02:25:54,940
And your instincts,

5948
02:25:54,941 --> 02:25:55,240
right?

5949
02:25:55,240 --> 02:25:57,700
Sort of like plugged into
something like the stock market.

5950
02:25:57,701 --> 02:25:58,280
I've got a hunch,

5951
02:25:58,280 --> 02:25:58,451
ah,

5952
02:25:58,451 --> 02:25:59,284
you don't have shit.

5953
02:26:00,770 --> 02:26:01,820
You might be right,

5954
02:26:01,821 --> 02:26:03,830
but you might be dealing with
something that's impossible.

5955
02:26:03,831 --> 02:26:04,161
And also,

5956
02:26:04,161 --> 02:26:04,371
you know,

5957
02:26:04,371 --> 02:26:06,800
guys who picks the machines
that pick stock markets,

5958
02:26:06,830 --> 02:26:08,270
stocks at random do fine.

5959
02:26:08,330 --> 02:26:08,871
You know what I mean?

5960
02:26:08,871 --> 02:26:10,670
They do just as good
as most stock brokers,

5961
02:26:10,700 --> 02:26:10,971
you know,

5962
02:26:10,971 --> 02:26:11,680
so it's,

5963
02:26:11,680 --> 02:26:11,900
you know,

5964
02:26:11,900 --> 02:26:12,131
but,

5965
02:26:12,131 --> 02:26:12,350
but,

5966
02:26:12,350 --> 02:26:15,500
but your intuition is really
good for personal relationships.

5967
02:26:15,501 --> 02:26:15,980
You know,

5968
02:26:15,980 --> 02:26:19,520
four things you would encounter
on the plains of Africa.

5969
02:26:19,550 --> 02:26:20,090
Right?

5970
02:26:20,090 --> 02:26:20,570
Danger,

5971
02:26:20,570 --> 02:26:21,510
you trust height,

5972
02:26:21,890 --> 02:26:22,131
you know,

5973
02:26:22,131 --> 02:26:23,180
why you're scared of heights,

5974
02:26:23,210 --> 02:26:23,391
you know,

5975
02:26:23,391 --> 02:26:24,560
certain situations.

5976
02:26:24,590 --> 02:26:26,120
And you know,

5977
02:26:26,121 --> 02:26:27,260
a lot of times they talk about,

5978
02:26:27,261 --> 02:26:30,740
you're picking up a lot of
silent cues or cues that are,

5979
02:26:30,741 --> 02:26:32,420
your conscious mind is not picking up.

5980
02:26:32,421 --> 02:26:33,100
Like,

5981
02:26:33,100 --> 02:26:33,710
you know,

5982
02:26:33,710 --> 02:26:34,940
the cop who,

5983
02:26:35,300 --> 02:26:37,040
he knows something's going on and he,

5984
02:26:37,050 --> 02:26:42,050
when he walks into the store and he's
not remembering that he saw a guy sitting

5985
02:26:42,231 --> 02:26:46,760
outside with the car running
and cigarettes or something
cute him to the fact

5986
02:26:46,761 --> 02:26:49,070
that there's something
hinky going on and you,

5987
02:26:49,071 --> 02:26:51,500
maybe he missed it consciously,

5988
02:26:51,560 --> 02:26:53,060
but subconsciously he's there.

5989
02:26:53,430 --> 02:26:54,450
You or the energy,

5990
02:26:54,451 --> 02:26:57,690
he can feel the energy of someone
who is trying not to get busted.

5991
02:26:57,691 --> 02:26:58,021
I mean,

5992
02:26:58,021 --> 02:26:59,880
who knows what vibe they're giving off.

5993
02:27:00,300 --> 02:27:00,571
Yeah.

5994
02:27:00,571 --> 02:27:05,571
It's the whole broad spectrum of senses
is very strange because there's been

5995
02:27:06,571 --> 02:27:10,890
certain studies that show that there are
some intangible qualities then we can

5996
02:27:10,891 --> 02:27:14,880
pick up on statistically like they've
shown that people can tell when people are

5997
02:27:14,881 --> 02:27:16,110
looking at the back of their head.

5998
02:27:16,380 --> 02:27:16,670
Right.

5999
02:27:16,670 --> 02:27:16,900
Yeah.

6000
02:27:16,900 --> 02:27:17,940
More than 50%.

6001
02:27:17,970 --> 02:27:18,361
It's like,

6002
02:27:18,361 --> 02:27:20,400
it's statistically significant.

6003
02:27:20,401 --> 02:27:20,611
Yeah.

6004
02:27:20,611 --> 02:27:21,221
Get significant.

6005
02:27:21,221 --> 02:27:21,410
Yeah.

6006
02:27:21,410 --> 02:27:22,380
We talk about the hunters,

6007
02:27:22,381 --> 02:27:23,214
gays,

6008
02:27:23,640 --> 02:27:23,940
you know,

6009
02:27:23,940 --> 02:27:25,290
we don't look at the animal,

6010
02:27:25,550 --> 02:27:25,830
you know,

6011
02:27:25,830 --> 02:27:26,663
until you're ready.

6012
02:27:27,140 --> 02:27:27,990
Cause it can feel you.

6013
02:27:28,200 --> 02:27:28,740
Yeah.

6014
02:27:28,740 --> 02:27:28,890
And,

6015
02:27:28,890 --> 02:27:30,450
and dawn sometimes,

6016
02:27:30,451 --> 02:27:31,650
and the snipers we'll talk about,

6017
02:27:31,651 --> 02:27:31,991
like you,

6018
02:27:31,991 --> 02:27:33,480
you have to look down and not only do,

6019
02:27:33,481 --> 02:27:35,430
you have to not look at your target,

6020
02:27:35,520 --> 02:27:36,600
you have to not think about it.

6021
02:27:37,440 --> 02:27:38,130
You got to go blank.

6022
02:27:38,130 --> 02:27:38,641
They have to go.

6023
02:27:38,641 --> 02:27:40,030
I'm a log in the log in my log.

6024
02:27:47,070 --> 02:27:48,500
This is a fucking awesome book.

6025
02:27:48,501 --> 02:27:50,390
I'm only three or four chapters in.

6026
02:27:50,391 --> 02:27:51,224
Where am I at?

6027
02:27:51,370 --> 02:27:52,150
Tell you where I'm at.

6028
02:27:52,150 --> 02:27:52,500
Um,

6029
02:27:52,500 --> 02:27:53,333
uh,

6030
02:27:54,010 --> 02:27:55,330
uh,

6031
02:27:56,560 --> 02:27:57,393
uh,

6032
02:27:58,320 --> 02:27:59,580
I'm thinking I'm naked
into the wilderness,

6033
02:27:59,581 --> 02:28:01,440
so I guess I'm the nine
in this John Macpherson.

6034
02:28:01,910 --> 02:28:03,300
It's fucking great stuff.

6035
02:28:03,330 --> 02:28:03,601
Thank you.

6036
02:28:03,601 --> 02:28:04,860
But it's a real page Turner.

6037
02:28:04,890 --> 02:28:05,371
I really,

6038
02:28:05,371 --> 02:28:05,501
I'm,

6039
02:28:05,501 --> 02:28:06,600
I'm enjoying the shit out of it.

6040
02:28:06,820 --> 02:28:07,350
Um,

6041
02:28:07,350 --> 02:28:07,711
like I said,

6042
02:28:07,711 --> 02:28:10,050
I started reading it this weekend and
I've been glued to it every night.

6043
02:28:10,140 --> 02:28:12,000
The disaster diaries by my man,

6044
02:28:12,001 --> 02:28:13,080
Sam Sheridan,

6045
02:28:13,260 --> 02:28:15,240
not Sam Sheridan on Twitter.

6046
02:28:15,241 --> 02:28:17,070
You got to go to fighter's mind.

6047
02:28:17,460 --> 02:28:18,630
I know you like Joe Rogan.

6048
02:28:18,631 --> 02:28:19,560
I can't remember that shit.

6049
02:28:19,561 --> 02:28:20,400
I can't remember it either.

6050
02:28:20,401 --> 02:28:22,000
But when

6051
02:28:22,000 --> 02:28:23,800
you type it into Twitter,

6052
02:28:23,801 --> 02:28:24,490
have you type the Tam,

6053
02:28:24,490 --> 02:28:26,050
Sam Sheridan into the search,

6054
02:28:26,051 --> 02:28:27,250
it will find fighter's mind.

6055
02:28:27,490 --> 02:28:28,211
That's the one you want.

6056
02:28:28,211 --> 02:28:29,110
Does it have a little,

6057
02:28:29,140 --> 02:28:31,090
do you have a little chalky
thing next to your name?

6058
02:28:31,400 --> 02:28:32,650
They verify your ass.

6059
02:28:32,830 --> 02:28:34,360
I'm sure that innocent
was checked to see that,

6060
02:28:34,370 --> 02:28:34,540
right?

6061
02:28:34,540 --> 02:28:34,790
No,

6062
02:28:34,790 --> 02:28:35,930
you will not verify.

6063
02:28:36,040 --> 02:28:37,740
I'm not very good at no damn man.

6064
02:28:38,200 --> 02:28:39,670
You can't even get a Wikipedia page pitch.

6065
02:28:39,700 --> 02:28:41,770
I know Wikipedia be hating on you.

6066
02:28:41,800 --> 02:28:41,921
Well,

6067
02:28:41,921 --> 02:28:45,160
it's because too many people tried to
make me a Wikipedia page and then it just,

6068
02:28:45,161 --> 02:28:47,050
now it's like they think
it's spam or something.

6069
02:28:47,051 --> 02:28:47,810
You think that,

6070
02:28:47,810 --> 02:28:49,680
I think someone in
Wikipedia fucking hates you.

6071
02:28:49,681 --> 02:28:50,514
And that's what I think.

6072
02:28:50,740 --> 02:28:52,030
I got to get a look on your page.

6073
02:28:52,070 --> 02:28:55,030
You don't have a Wikipedia
page that's got three books.

6074
02:28:55,031 --> 02:28:59,200
And I got the people that the one pit
willing book who have porn together.

6075
02:28:59,270 --> 02:29:00,101
We start pouring to quit.

6076
02:29:00,101 --> 02:29:01,930
Everyone who's a porn star on Wikipedia.

6077
02:29:01,931 --> 02:29:03,490
So maybe you could do like a solo,

6078
02:29:03,491 --> 02:29:05,560
both of us and like in
the backyard we'll get on.

6079
02:29:05,561 --> 02:29:08,110
It sounds like the only way,

6080
02:29:08,830 --> 02:29:10,420
if you want to make it look,

6081
02:29:10,421 --> 02:29:11,590
we're talking about survival.

6082
02:29:11,710 --> 02:29:12,521
You gotta do what you gotta do.

6083
02:29:12,521 --> 02:29:13,810
Miss is Internet survival.

6084
02:29:13,811 --> 02:29:14,920
There's only one way to go.

6085
02:29:15,160 --> 02:29:15,371
Yeah,

6086
02:29:15,371 --> 02:29:15,620
there's,

6087
02:29:15,620 --> 02:29:16,453
there's no way to make it,

6088
02:29:16,650 --> 02:29:17,220
um,

6089
02:29:17,220 --> 02:29:18,001
this weekend.

6090
02:29:18,001 --> 02:29:23,001
Mad Flavor and I Aka Joey Diaz this Friday
night or going to be at the grove in

6091
02:29:23,641 --> 02:29:24,850
Anaheim a,

6092
02:29:24,900 --> 02:29:25,890
if you go to my,

6093
02:29:25,891 --> 02:29:26,670
um,

6094
02:29:26,670 --> 02:29:28,350
my Twitter page or my website,

6095
02:29:28,351 --> 02:29:29,171
you could find the,

6096
02:29:29,171 --> 02:29:29,251
uh,

6097
02:29:29,251 --> 02:29:29,881
the information,

6098
02:29:29,881 --> 02:29:31,980
but the grove in Anaheim
this Friday night,

6099
02:29:32,010 --> 02:29:35,100
me and Joey motherfucking Diaz,

6100
02:29:35,160 --> 02:29:36,180
we didn't do team today.

6101
02:29:36,181 --> 02:29:37,020
We'll do the tank tomorrow.

6102
02:29:37,050 --> 02:29:37,381

heart and fighter's mind.

books written on MMA and uh,
