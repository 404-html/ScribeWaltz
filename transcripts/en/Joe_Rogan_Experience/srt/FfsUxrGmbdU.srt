1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:01,650
Hello?

2
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:02,880
Freak bitches.

3
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:03,600
Yeah.

4
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:04,670
Well we just spent the same,

5
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,620
say I did some magnetic chick to my brain.

6
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:08,573
Wow.

7
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:08,961
Yeah.

8
00:00:08,961 --> 00:00:09,301
I go,

9
00:00:09,301 --> 00:00:10,081
I feel like I'm your,

10
00:00:10,081 --> 00:00:10,530
your,

11
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:11,910
your depression correspondent.

12
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:15,390
Like I go out and do crazy shit.

13
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:16,531
I did that.

14
00:00:16,531 --> 00:00:16,880
I'll,

15
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:17,221
all right,

16
00:00:17,221 --> 00:00:18,090
so it's called tr.

17
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,620
I talked about it last time was here.

18
00:00:19,621 --> 00:00:20,670
I was going to do it.

19
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:22,200
I did,

20
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:22,920
um,

21
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,480
I did ketamine,

22
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:26,730
which I got to say I cannot recommend.

23
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:27,510
Really?

24
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:28,050
Yeah,

25
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:29,250
I did three.

26
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:29,671
No,

27
00:00:29,671 --> 00:00:31,140
actually I did six sessions.

28
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:32,220
Uh,

29
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:33,780
which was crazy.

30
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:34,321
Did it.

31
00:00:34,321 --> 00:00:39,321
But the side effects long term were my
eyes burnt for straight up two to three

32
00:00:39,871 --> 00:00:41,360
months every day.

33
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:42,773
Um,

34
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:43,130
yeah.

35
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:43,860
Houses like burn,

36
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:45,510
like I needed drops constantly.

37
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:48,710
Like I'm like you stare at
the Sun burnt when the like,

38
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:49,680
like irritated.

39
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:51,270
I'm like,

40
00:00:51,271 --> 00:00:52,140
you got something in them.

41
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,130
Yeah.

42
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:53,963
More like that.

43
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:54,600
Uh,

44
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,950
and I just felt like kind of groggy
and out of it for a couple months.

45
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:58,590
Really?

46
00:00:58,590 --> 00:00:59,400
Yeah.

47
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,530
Then I did explain,

48
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:02,990
so ketamine glossier.

49
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:03,510
Yeah.

50
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:03,661
Well,

51
00:01:03,661 --> 00:01:04,650
I talked about it last time I was here,

52
00:01:04,651 --> 00:01:05,640
but yeah,

53
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:09,810
cause I got a lot of talk about you
were going to do it or you don't.

54
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:11,320
It may be I was going to do it.

55
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:12,210
I think you had done it.

56
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:12,421
Yeah,

57
00:01:12,421 --> 00:01:13,590
I had done it and I was,

58
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:15,390
it was still too early to tell,

59
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:19,140
but I remember running into in the hall
the comedy store and you were super

60
00:01:19,141 --> 00:01:19,351
happy.

61
00:01:19,351 --> 00:01:20,130
It was amazing.

62
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:21,120
The first time I did it,

63
00:01:21,121 --> 00:01:25,200
the first two sessions were great and
then after that I kind of hit a plateau

64
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:25,830
and,

65
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:26,940
and the,

66
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,230
I just kind of felt like,

67
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:31,860
just kinda like groggy for a not kidding,

68
00:01:31,861 --> 00:01:32,910
like a couple months.

69
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:34,080
So the first session you,

70
00:01:34,081 --> 00:01:36,090
did you get this positive benefit from it?

71
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:36,361
Yeah,

72
00:01:36,361 --> 00:01:37,740
they point in continuing,

73
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,753
uh,

74
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:40,170
because the,

75
00:01:40,171 --> 00:01:40,710
the,

76
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:42,630
the treatment is six sessions.

77
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:43,463
The protocol,

78
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:44,723
that's the protocol.

79
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:45,953
So,

80
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:46,470
um,

81
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:46,771
hold on.

82
00:01:46,771 --> 00:01:48,030
I think I have video of it too.

83
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:48,923
Whoa.

84
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:54,070
I know I have video witching
and you're just in a,

85
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:57,210
basically in like a hospital room and uh,

86
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:01,260
and experience itself you said
was full blown psychedelic,

87
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:05,610
straight up fucking 100% tripping,

88
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:06,623
tripping balls.

89
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:09,060
And this is all FDA approved.

90
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:09,470
Uh,

91
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:12,630
it's FDA approved as an anesthetic.

92
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:13,230
Right.

93
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:14,700
It's not FDA approved.

94
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:15,860
I actually know it.

95
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:16,501
It's getting the,

96
00:02:16,501 --> 00:02:17,041
I think it is.

97
00:02:17,041 --> 00:02:19,410
They're actually because otherwise
wouldn't be able to talk about it.

98
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:19,880
Yeah.

99
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:20,190
Uh,

100
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:22,470
it is approved as an off label,

101
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:23,550
uh,

102
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:25,680
depression treatment off labels.

103
00:02:25,681 --> 00:02:26,431
Tricky Shit,

104
00:02:26,431 --> 00:02:27,030
isn't it?

105
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:27,870
Yes.

106
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:29,340
Because there's no,

107
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:30,870
they don't know.

108
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:31,230
Yeah.

109
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:31,711
Maybe.

110
00:02:31,711 --> 00:02:33,510
I mean that's all of them in some ways,

111
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,160
especially with antidepressants.

112
00:02:35,161 --> 00:02:35,701
It's all like,

113
00:02:35,701 --> 00:02:35,881
yeah,

114
00:02:35,881 --> 00:02:36,714
this might,

115
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:38,370
this might could do something,

116
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,210
maybe not.

117
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:40,110
I liked that.

118
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,320
There's stuff that they can do to
you that is definitely beneficial,

119
00:02:43,321 --> 00:02:44,154
but it's just,

120
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:44,641
you know,

121
00:02:44,641 --> 00:02:45,960
your insurance isn't gonna cover it.

122
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:46,820
If you have the cash,

123
00:02:46,821 --> 00:02:47,700
you can pay for it.

124
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:48,330
Yeah.

125
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:48,750
That's,

126
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:52,230
that's kind of the situation I was in
where it's like nobody was going to pay

127
00:02:52,231 --> 00:02:52,651
for it.

128
00:02:52,651 --> 00:02:56,810
But if you want to roll the dice and
I rolled the dice and I got to say,

129
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:58,703
but you,

130
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:01,750
do you think that if the
initial treatments that you had,

131
00:03:01,751 --> 00:03:04,000
the first couple that you
really had good responses from,

132
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:05,170
if you just stop there,

133
00:03:05,171 --> 00:03:06,430
you'd have a different opinion of it.

134
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:08,913
I don't know.

135
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:10,600
That's the thing is if
I had just done at once,

136
00:03:10,601 --> 00:03:12,220
it kind of felt like you ever do acid.

137
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:13,000
Yes.

138
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,670
You know that like paying
that like super clear feeling.

139
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:16,480
Yes.

140
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,130
That's how I felt the day I saw you.

141
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:19,840
I did ask him for the first time,

142
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:21,130
like I was,

143
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:22,270
I want to say four months ago.

144
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:22,880
Oh Wow.

145
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,500
Months ago.

146
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,190
That's great.

147
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:24,760
What'd you think?

148
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,540
Loved it.

149
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:25,871
Yeah.

150
00:03:25,871 --> 00:03:26,950
You didn't find it too intense?

151
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:27,640
No.

152
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,100
Okay.

153
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,560
Because it can be speedy as fuck.

154
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:32,680
I'm so used to edibles and float tanks.

155
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:33,540
Yeah.

156
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:35,200
That I think it's,

157
00:03:35,201 --> 00:03:36,010
uh,

158
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:37,330
it's very interesting.

159
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:38,590
It was very clean,

160
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:39,880
like the eye,

161
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,050
the idea behind it,

162
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,041
like the,

163
00:03:42,041 --> 00:03:42,280
uh,

164
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:42,491
the,

165
00:03:42,491 --> 00:03:43,810
the feeling behind it,

166
00:03:43,811 --> 00:03:44,980
the thought process behind it.

167
00:03:44,981 --> 00:03:45,250
I was like,

168
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:45,490
Ooh,

169
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:48,070
this is like some mine clarifier.

170
00:03:48,071 --> 00:03:48,904
It's like,

171
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:49,140
like,

172
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:49,420
you know,

173
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:49,841
Bill Hicks,

174
00:03:49,841 --> 00:03:51,600
he used to call it a
squeegee and your third,

175
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:52,700
I like mushrooms.

176
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:53,380
That's,

177
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:54,213
it felt,

178
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,121
it felt very,

179
00:03:55,121 --> 00:03:55,930
uh,

180
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:58,210
clarifying if that makes any sense.

181
00:03:58,211 --> 00:03:59,560
But of course it makes total sense.

182
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:00,880
I felt great.

183
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:02,320
I felt really good.

184
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:04,090
Felt really friendly

185
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:07,720
during.

186
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,201
Yeah,

187
00:04:08,201 --> 00:04:08,561
man,

188
00:04:08,561 --> 00:04:10,150
like real musta had good stuff.

189
00:04:10,151 --> 00:04:15,130
Cause a lot of times it can be speedy
and it ends up feeling like mushrooms and

190
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:16,930
I think mushroom math.

191
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:17,490
Oh,

192
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:18,830
combined you're saying?

193
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:19,120
Yeah.

194
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,460
You end up with this just
like intense fucking,

195
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:23,710
it's not the God damn
problem is that it's illegal.

196
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,280
Okay.

197
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,930
You're getting weird versions of it.

198
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:27,040
Here's your thing,

199
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:29,350
here's the doctor
putting the Ivm IIR okay.

200
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:30,303
Oh Jesus.

201
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,593
Can I say it?

202
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:32,440
Yeah.

203
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,273
Oh Christ.

204
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,593
Okay.

205
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:37,610
Did you take this with the 1980s phone?

206
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:37,941
No,

207
00:04:37,941 --> 00:04:40,310
that's just the way
it's saved or whatever.

208
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,720
Why does it seem so little?

209
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:42,583
I don't know.

210
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:46,300
This is blue.

211
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:47,630
Are you blowing okay?

212
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:48,261
No,

213
00:04:48,261 --> 00:04:48,680
I can't.

214
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,513
All right.

215
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:52,260
So this doctor is,

216
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:52,670
uh,

217
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:54,000
he looked like Bob Shapiro.

218
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,030
Ojs Council.

219
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:55,311
Oh,

220
00:04:55,311 --> 00:04:56,140
just lead counsel.

221
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:56,973
You can

222
00:04:58,290 --> 00:04:59,123
corner.

223
00:04:59,190 --> 00:04:59,970
Um,

224
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:00,571
so we just,

225
00:05:00,571 --> 00:05:05,330
you just go into a regular doctor's
office and sticks this thing in your own

226
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,500
thing in your arm and off you go.

227
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:08,700
Now the doctor has,

228
00:05:08,701 --> 00:05:09,630
he tried it himself.

229
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:10,441
Uh,

230
00:05:10,441 --> 00:05:12,000
he would not say,

231
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:12,830
but it was,

232
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:15,990
he said it with a wink that he had.

233
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:16,861
He was like,

234
00:05:16,861 --> 00:05:20,460
I won't comment either way on
whether I've done it myself.

235
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:21,480
So all those guys,

236
00:05:21,481 --> 00:05:23,010
they wanted to keep it on the sneak tip.

237
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:23,760
Yeah.

238
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:26,100
But clearly he had and so yeah.

239
00:05:26,101 --> 00:05:29,610
So I would say for for the
first session was amazing.

240
00:05:29,611 --> 00:05:30,480
That's when I saw you.

241
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:33,180
And then after that it got a little dicey.

242
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:37,170
Now what does it feel
like when you're in it?

243
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,220
I was in a,

244
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:40,170
it felt like I was in a pod,

245
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,870
a pod in like a small,

246
00:05:42,871 --> 00:05:45,000
it's a small world after all like Pod,

247
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:50,970
I'm going into the [inaudible] now
crossing my arms and I would like a little

248
00:05:50,971 --> 00:05:55,971
boat just going along through rooms and
the rooms I would say were designed like

249
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:01,130
kind of a bit like a,

250
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:05,450
what's the a clockwork
orange but like the,

251
00:06:05,451 --> 00:06:06,980
the milk bar thing,

252
00:06:06,981 --> 00:06:08,930
a bit like white walls,

253
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:11,680
white breathing walls and yeah,

254
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:12,111
breathing.

255
00:06:12,111 --> 00:06:12,944
I'd say they were breathing.

256
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:16,730
Yeah they were inhaling and exhaling and,

257
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:21,970
but I was never freaked out and then
there was like kind of digits on it.

258
00:06:22,011 --> 00:06:22,844
Like the Matrix,

259
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:24,770
it had like a green hue to it.

260
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:26,623
Um,

261
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:29,840
my biggest worry when I was in
it was like I'm so out of it.

262
00:06:29,841 --> 00:06:33,600
If there's an earthquake
I'm fucked like I am.

263
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:36,500
And then I would get like
wide shots of California.

264
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:41,450
We'll get like wide shots of California
and take about like the hospital

265
00:06:41,451 --> 00:06:42,284
crumbling.

266
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:46,280
And then I've me trying to get out
and go and like I can't go man,

267
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:47,480
you're not going to have to go without me.

268
00:06:47,481 --> 00:06:49,670
Give me 40 minutes and
I'll catch up to you guys.

269
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:50,690
Uh,

270
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:52,190
so that was my biggest worry,

271
00:06:52,191 --> 00:06:54,410
but for the most part it was
just like a fairly pleasant,

272
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:58,430
I just couldn't get over the fact that
this was happening in a doctor's office.

273
00:06:58,930 --> 00:06:59,350
Right.

274
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:01,860
It's just like a regular
ass fucking doctor.

275
00:07:01,861 --> 00:07:05,480
Like literally waiting room with
other physicians and their patients.

276
00:07:05,481 --> 00:07:06,580
Old Weirdos,

277
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:07,180
Ma,

278
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:08,870
it's shitty magazines.

279
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:14,030
And then you go in and you trip your
fucking head off and so you're sitting in

280
00:07:14,031 --> 00:07:15,140
like a regular chair.

281
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:15,951
You're sitting,

282
00:07:15,951 --> 00:07:16,530
it's a,

283
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:17,331
it's a recliner,

284
00:07:17,331 --> 00:07:19,730
double bed cosmetic type thing.

285
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:20,001
Oh yeah.

286
00:07:20,001 --> 00:07:20,511
It's real nice.

287
00:07:20,511 --> 00:07:20,901
They spared,

288
00:07:20,901 --> 00:07:21,061
no,

289
00:07:21,061 --> 00:07:21,894
he's nuts.

290
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,100
So you're sitting in this
craftmatic adjustable bed,

291
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:25,840
um,

292
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:25,970
you,

293
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:26,300
you,

294
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:29,450
you get the needle in the arm and
they leave it in there for how long?

295
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,100
40 40 minutes.

296
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:31,963
40 minutes.

297
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:33,110
Now if an earthquake happened,

298
00:07:33,111 --> 00:07:34,400
could you just pull the
needle out of your arm?

299
00:07:34,401 --> 00:07:35,720
And it was so out of it.

300
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,010
I don't think I could have.

301
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,870
I think once the drip happened,

302
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:41,070
like it's in you for a while.

303
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:42,200
Uh,

304
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,340
so what's the drip happens?

305
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:45,050
You probably have however long.

306
00:07:45,051 --> 00:07:46,670
I mean it's a 40 minute trip apparently,

307
00:07:46,671 --> 00:07:48,200
but I don't know if it's based on one,

308
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,040
if it's,

309
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,660
I don't know how much is going in at once.

310
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:51,980
Now that stuff,

311
00:07:51,981 --> 00:07:53,600
ketamine is weird because it's,

312
00:07:53,601 --> 00:07:54,434
um,

313
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,850
it was a tranquilizer,

314
00:07:55,851 --> 00:07:56,181
right.

315
00:07:56,181 --> 00:07:57,014
For animals.

316
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:58,040
Yeah,

317
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:58,551
exactly.

318
00:07:58,551 --> 00:07:58,830
That's a,

319
00:07:58,830 --> 00:07:59,663
it's a,

320
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:03,590
it's a horse tranquilizer and they
use it as an anesthesia for humans.

321
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:04,131
Yeah,

322
00:08:04,131 --> 00:08:04,910
I've heard of that.

323
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:06,710
The guy was an anesthesiologist.

324
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:07,341
He was,

325
00:08:07,341 --> 00:08:07,970
yeah.

326
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:09,560
Don't they use that in war time?

327
00:08:09,561 --> 00:08:11,210
Because it's easy to carry around.

328
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:16,490
I believe they have in war time because
you can use very small amounts and it

329
00:08:16,491 --> 00:08:17,390
puts people under,

330
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:18,920
you know what that sounds like.

331
00:08:18,921 --> 00:08:20,450
That sounds like a Joe Rogan fact.

332
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:21,440
Yeah.

333
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,310
I don't know for sure.

334
00:08:22,311 --> 00:08:23,360
But it sounds like,

335
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:24,050
yes.

336
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:24,501
I think,

337
00:08:24,501 --> 00:08:24,710
uh,

338
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:25,970
I'm pretty sure that's the case.

339
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:27,010
I'm pretty sure.

340
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:27,680
Uh,

341
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:32,680
I was listening to a podcast with her
talking about various forms of anesthesia

342
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:37,610
and sort of the evolution of using
anesthesia and that ketamine worked really

343
00:08:37,611 --> 00:08:40,820
good in the field because you could
have a very small amount and you would,

344
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:41,600
you know,

345
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,890
put someone under pretty deeply.

346
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:43,641
I don't know.

347
00:08:43,641 --> 00:08:45,320
What if it's local?

348
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:45,861
Do you know what I mean?

349
00:08:45,861 --> 00:08:46,011
Like,

350
00:08:46,011 --> 00:08:47,810
I don't know if you
could have done surgery.

351
00:08:47,811 --> 00:08:49,490
It wasn't like I couldn't feel myself.

352
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:50,180
Right.

353
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:52,340
It was more like I had no interest in it.

354
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:57,400
When you got here following FDA approval
in 1971 did that Asia was first given

355
00:08:57,931 --> 00:08:59,610
to American soldiers
during the Vietnam War.

356
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:00,240
Oh,

357
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,073
there you go.

358
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:03,283
Uh,

359
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:03,691
yeah.

360
00:09:03,691 --> 00:09:05,490
There's a lot of shit on reddit about,

361
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:07,050
about it as an,

362
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:08,910
as an antidepressant treatment.

363
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:10,080
Frantic for depression.

364
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:11,640
So for you,

365
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:12,833
um,

366
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,160
you heard about this,

367
00:09:14,161 --> 00:09:14,994
how,

368
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:16,380
I don't know.

369
00:09:16,381 --> 00:09:19,620
I want to say if you just
Google depression treatments,

370
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:21,480
so you just worked growing my age too,

371
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:24,570
or alternative depression
treatment is probably what I,

372
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:28,590
what I Google now we've had these
conversations before you and I have found

373
00:09:28,591 --> 00:09:30,420
about depression and different treatments.

374
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,670
How much exercise do you do?

375
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:33,661
A,

376
00:09:33,661 --> 00:09:34,590
did we talk about this before?

377
00:09:34,591 --> 00:09:35,280
I send them out?

378
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,300
I've run probably three,

379
00:09:36,301 --> 00:09:37,110
four days a week.

380
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:37,830
That's pretty nice.

381
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:38,340
Yeah.

382
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:39,840
That's supposed to be
one of the best things.

383
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:40,081
Yeah.

384
00:09:40,081 --> 00:09:40,780
Depressions.

385
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:41,160
Yeah.

386
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:41,993
Cardio.

387
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:43,890
But like I've never
gotten a runner's high,

388
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:44,760
if that makes sense.

389
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,150
Really.

390
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:48,780
I think I have a shortage
of dopamine in my brain.

391
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:49,913
Just naturally.

392
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,350
Like I just think I don't have a
ton of dough mean like I don't,

393
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:55,440
joy is not a thing I think
I've ever experienced.

394
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:59,280
What I repeat joy is a thing that I
don't think I've ever experienced.

395
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:04,310
I'll experience adrenaline rushes and
like ego but I'll never be truly like

396
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,071
Julius.

397
00:10:08,071 --> 00:10:08,460
Yeah,

398
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:09,000
it stinks.

399
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,890
It fucking stinks cause
it's something I'm,

400
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:13,050
I I believe in,

401
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:14,120
I just don't,

402
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,840
I've accomplished things I've done,

403
00:10:15,841 --> 00:10:16,381
you know what I mean?

404
00:10:16,381 --> 00:10:19,560
But I never get this
sense of like this real,

405
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:20,821
you know,

406
00:10:20,821 --> 00:10:22,560
in very small doses.

407
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:24,510
Vic extremely like micro doses.

408
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:27,600
So like let me put into
perspective like career wise,

409
00:10:27,601 --> 00:10:28,110
like yeah,

410
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:30,250
you had a nice comedy central special,

411
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,620
they put a lot of hype behind it.

412
00:10:31,621 --> 00:10:31,950
You did.

413
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:32,611
I watched,

414
00:10:32,611 --> 00:10:33,570
he did really well.

415
00:10:33,571 --> 00:10:34,770
Got a great response.

416
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,840
How'd you feel when all that was over?

417
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:38,340
I felt cool.

418
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:39,180
Cool.

419
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:39,890
Do you know what I mean?

420
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:40,650
Like I felt like,

421
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:40,951
yeah,

422
00:10:40,951 --> 00:10:41,401
exactly.

423
00:10:41,401 --> 00:10:41,851
Like all right,

424
00:10:41,851 --> 00:10:42,684
good shit man.

425
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:43,800
Keep going.

426
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:44,633
See what else.

427
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:45,030
Yeah.

428
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:47,430
But it was never like
during Chappelle show,

429
00:10:47,431 --> 00:10:48,200
I never got like,

430
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,260
I am the king of the world.

431
00:10:49,261 --> 00:10:49,711
You know what I mean?

432
00:10:49,711 --> 00:10:52,710
Like never that sort of like huge,

433
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,353
uh,

434
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:55,851
you know,

435
00:10:55,851 --> 00:10:57,200
something that would
make you want to scream.

436
00:10:57,201 --> 00:10:57,930
You feel so good.

437
00:10:57,930 --> 00:10:58,270
Right.

438
00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:00,320
Do you get that much all day?

439
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:01,881
24,

440
00:11:01,881 --> 00:11:02,480
seven.

441
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,220
I just hold it in and
trying not to scream.

442
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:06,410
If you want to take a break,

443
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,910
if you want to go up on the roof.

444
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:10,340
I'm the worst guy to talk to this
about because I don't really,

445
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:11,660
I don't really get depressed.

446
00:11:11,661 --> 00:11:12,860
I've been depressed before,

447
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:14,390
but answering my question,

448
00:11:14,391 --> 00:11:15,170
the joint question,

449
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:16,340
I'm joyful all the time.

450
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:17,660
So that wasn't a joke.

451
00:11:17,661 --> 00:11:18,051
You've really,

452
00:11:18,051 --> 00:11:18,861
I'm pretty happy.

453
00:11:18,861 --> 00:11:19,694
That's great.

454
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,460
Here's the good news.

455
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:21,240
You seem happy.

456
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:21,740
Yeah.

457
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:22,191
Like I don't,

458
00:11:22,191 --> 00:11:22,761
I buy it.

459
00:11:22,761 --> 00:11:24,050
I'm not laying his fucking Joe.

460
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:25,130
Joe Rogan thinks he's happy.

461
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:25,993
You seem happy.

462
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:27,710
I have a lot of friends.

463
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:28,430
Yeah.

464
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:29,510
Like that's a big part of it.

465
00:11:29,511 --> 00:11:30,020
You know,

466
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:31,100
a lot of cool friends.

467
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:31,870
I love,

468
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:32,390
uh,

469
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:33,590
I love having a family.

470
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:35,000
Love what I do.

471
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:35,390
Yeah.

472
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:36,290
Like my jobs,

473
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,960
my day is filled with stuff I enjoy doing.

474
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:39,823
Yeah.

475
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:40,753
You know what I mean?

476
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:42,380
It's just fucking,

477
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:43,243
I'm just lucky.

478
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:43,711
Yeah.

479
00:11:43,711 --> 00:11:44,121
Super loud.

480
00:11:44,121 --> 00:11:46,310
But I have many of the same things.

481
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,030
Yeah.

482
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:52,030
I just don't feel that that
sense of satisfaction you,

483
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:53,120
you have now,

484
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,251
it varied.

485
00:11:54,251 --> 00:11:57,190
Have you had higher and lower
feelings of satisfaction?

486
00:11:58,570 --> 00:11:59,051
Yeah,

487
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:01,090
I think when I'm working a
lot I feel pretty satisfied.

488
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:01,600
Oh,

489
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,260
okay.

490
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:02,561
Okay.

491
00:12:02,561 --> 00:12:04,750
So accomplishments or task,

492
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,470
task and goal oriented.

493
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:08,860
Like I like,

494
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,820
it's satisfying to deal with
special or direct a commercial or,

495
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:13,930
or,

496
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:15,640
or write a TV show or,

497
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:16,060
you know,

498
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:16,211
well,

499
00:12:16,211 --> 00:12:16,961
I'll tell you one thing.

500
00:12:16,961 --> 00:12:21,220
I say I'm filled with joy and I'm happy
all the time when I'm not working or I'm

501
00:12:21,221 --> 00:12:23,100
not accomplishing
anything or I'm not doing,

502
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:25,210
like if I get like real lazy,

503
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,260
I can get depressed.

504
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,810
Somebody else told me that
they said that a very,

505
00:12:28,811 --> 00:12:31,090
very joyous guy told me
when he gets injured,

506
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:32,050
he just,

507
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:33,160
that takes it out of him.

508
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:34,360
Ken,

509
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,250
I've been injured gang of times.

510
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:38,350
I've had a bunch of surgeries from,

511
00:12:38,351 --> 00:12:39,184
um,

512
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:39,490
you know,

513
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:40,390
athletic injuries.

514
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,141
But,

515
00:12:41,141 --> 00:12:41,974
um,

516
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:43,570
for me,

517
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:43,960
uh,

518
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,250
if I go into Lowe's,

519
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:49,420
like if I'm not accomplishing things or
in the past I don't allow myself to get

520
00:12:49,421 --> 00:12:52,270
into those anymore because
it's just not a good feeling.

521
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:53,111
And even,

522
00:12:53,111 --> 00:12:58,111
it doesn't even necessarily have to
be like a career like oriented thing,

523
00:12:58,961 --> 00:13:00,880
but I have to have
things that I'm enjoying.

524
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:01,220
Yeah.

525
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:01,961
It could just be like,

526
00:13:01,961 --> 00:13:03,130
I'm really in doing yoga,

527
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,800
I'm doing yoga every day I do it,

528
00:13:05,801 --> 00:13:07,870
I get it done and now
I feel great and yeah.

529
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:09,940
But if I'm not doing something I,

530
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:11,770
my brain for whatever reason,

531
00:13:11,771 --> 00:13:13,090
needs tasks,

532
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,970
it needs stuff to do and
need stuff to figure out.

533
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:17,860
It needs like puzzles.

534
00:13:17,861 --> 00:13:18,694
Yeah.

535
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:19,960
If I don't get that I have,

536
00:13:19,961 --> 00:13:20,860
I have real issue.

537
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:21,400
Yeah.

538
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,210
Agreed.

539
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:24,410
Do you like big longterm goals?

540
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:25,090
It's like,

541
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:25,331
yeah,

542
00:13:25,331 --> 00:13:25,720
you do.

543
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:26,290
Yeah.

544
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:27,930
I'd like to handles it or micro thing.

545
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:28,210
I like,

546
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:29,050
I like those too.

547
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:33,100
I like things that are due in like a
week as opposed to something that's like,

548
00:13:33,101 --> 00:13:33,401
yeah,

549
00:13:33,401 --> 00:13:34,600
whenever you're like,

550
00:13:34,601 --> 00:13:35,860
I'm outlining a movie right now,

551
00:13:35,861 --> 00:13:36,191
and I'm like,

552
00:13:36,191 --> 00:13:36,970
yeah,

553
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:37,361
but I don't,

554
00:13:37,361 --> 00:13:38,860
I wish it were more like bang,

555
00:13:38,861 --> 00:13:39,160
Bang.

556
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:39,340
Yeah.

557
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:40,930
Like I'm meeting about it tomorrow.

558
00:13:40,931 --> 00:13:42,130
Like specifically to,

559
00:13:42,131 --> 00:13:44,410
so to like kind of focus myself.

560
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:47,990
Like you write a joke and then you go
up do it tonight and he kills like,

561
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:48,700
yeah.

562
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:49,030
Yeah.

563
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:49,211
Oh,

564
00:13:49,211 --> 00:13:50,140
that's okay.

565
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:51,010
That's something that,

566
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:51,933
that's joy.

567
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:53,060
That's pretty generic.

568
00:13:53,061 --> 00:13:53,471
Their joy.

569
00:13:53,471 --> 00:13:54,120
Yeah.

570
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,510
Knowing or just writing a joke,

571
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:57,460
a joke that it can and it kills.

572
00:13:57,490 --> 00:14:00,090
It's like dad feeling,

573
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:00,340
man.

574
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,770
Don't you wish you could give that
to people who don't do stand up?

575
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:03,220
Yep.

576
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,053
I sure do.

577
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:04,990
I mean,

578
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:05,351
it's just like,

579
00:14:05,351 --> 00:14:05,591
it's,

580
00:14:05,591 --> 00:14:05,890
it.

581
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:06,131
I've,

582
00:14:06,131 --> 00:14:09,130
I've had this conversation with people
before that don't do stand up and I'm

583
00:14:09,131 --> 00:14:09,281
like,

584
00:14:09,281 --> 00:14:09,701
man,

585
00:14:09,701 --> 00:14:14,701
I wish I could tell you what it's like
to crush in front of 5,000 people finding

586
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:16,510
$100,000.

587
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:18,303
Do you know what I mean?

588
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:19,450
That's how it feels.

589
00:14:19,451 --> 00:14:19,960
It feels like,

590
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:20,201
oh,

591
00:14:20,201 --> 00:14:21,850
I just found $100,000.

592
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:23,500
And you know what led me there?

593
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:27,840
My personality and my
experience coming in,

594
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:28,870
incoming me nervous.

595
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:30,093
Um,

596
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:30,521
yeah.

597
00:14:30,521 --> 00:14:31,030
So this,

598
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:32,110
this tms thing,

599
00:14:32,111 --> 00:14:35,350
transcranial magnetic stimulation
covered by Blue Cross,

600
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,160
huh?

601
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:36,993
Yeah.

602
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:37,450
Uh,

603
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:38,021
so yeah,

604
00:14:38,021 --> 00:14:39,940
that's what like it's,

605
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:40,480
it's,

606
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,380
it was really,

607
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:42,011
really good.

608
00:14:42,011 --> 00:14:42,844
Like I,

609
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:46,480
for a lot of my life I felt
like I had a all right,

610
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:47,500
I had like a,

611
00:14:47,501 --> 00:14:48,301
I had like a,

612
00:14:48,301 --> 00:14:48,760
a,

613
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:49,960
a thing like a,

614
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:52,790
it almost felt like a metal weight,

615
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:57,080
like a bit of like five pound
weight on my upper left forehead,

616
00:14:57,081 --> 00:14:57,914
my left.

617
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,400
And then so I went to this Whoa,

618
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:02,234
dude,

619
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:05,210
that sound is like an Mri.

620
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:05,761
Yeah,

621
00:15:05,761 --> 00:15:06,600
that's what it is.

622
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:07,290
It is.

623
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:07,591
Yes.

624
00:15:07,591 --> 00:15:10,170
It's basically the same
exact magnet as an MRI.

625
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:10,591
What?

626
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:11,860
It's just made your day.

627
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:12,151
Yeah.

628
00:15:12,151 --> 00:15:13,320
They put it on your head.

629
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:14,183
It's pretty simple.

630
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:15,390
The first time they measure it,

631
00:15:15,391 --> 00:15:17,130
they have to get to like the exact spot.

632
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:17,750
There's,

633
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:21,000
and there's another video where my
finger is pulsing that you'll enjoy.

634
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:22,650
And what is it doing to you?

635
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,700
Like what's the benefit?

636
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,480
Uh,

637
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:29,130
it's basically magnetizing
and electrifying a,

638
00:15:29,131 --> 00:15:30,150
it's waking up,

639
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:35,180
basically did a synopsis
according to them.

640
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:36,390
Really?

641
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:37,050
Yeah.

642
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:37,560
So it's,

643
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,720
it's waking up dead synapses and,

644
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:40,330
uh,

645
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:41,510
picking up dead,

646
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:43,250
waking them up so they're dormant.

647
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:44,360
Ah,

648
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,260
that's what they say.

649
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:46,783
Um,

650
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:47,810
you don't even look into it.

651
00:15:47,811 --> 00:15:48,021
You're like,

652
00:15:48,021 --> 00:15:48,321
good,

653
00:15:48,321 --> 00:15:48,851
shoot me out here.

654
00:15:48,851 --> 00:15:49,684
What is it?

655
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:51,720
Can I do quarter one?

656
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:54,170
And this one time I don't have kids,

657
00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:54,531
man.

658
00:15:54,531 --> 00:15:55,071
So I'm like,

659
00:15:55,071 --> 00:15:55,310
yeah,

660
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:55,970
I don't give a shit,

661
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:56,511
whatever,

662
00:15:56,511 --> 00:15:57,800
whatever it's going to cost me.

663
00:15:57,801 --> 00:15:58,670
I'm happy to do it.

664
00:15:58,850 --> 00:15:59,421
If you had kids,

665
00:15:59,421 --> 00:16:00,254
you think you wouldn't do it?

666
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:01,420
I think kids,

667
00:16:01,421 --> 00:16:02,140
I'd be like,

668
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:02,590
you know,

669
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:03,730
sort of more,

670
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:06,640
more cautious about it were young.

671
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:07,240
Yeah,

672
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:07,950
probably.

673
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:08,350
Cause I'm,

674
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:09,460
I'm not like reckless,

675
00:16:09,461 --> 00:16:10,294
but I'm not,

676
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:11,680
I'm not like,

677
00:16:11,681 --> 00:16:12,514
uh,

678
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:13,810
I do research.

679
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,190
It's also vague anyway.

680
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:15,670
Mm.

681
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:16,301
The research,

682
00:16:16,301 --> 00:16:16,991
it's also like,

683
00:16:16,991 --> 00:16:18,070
we think it does this.

684
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:19,630
Most antidepressants,

685
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:20,410
they know,

686
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:22,150
they think they know what's happening.

687
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:23,860
They don't actually know.

688
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:24,641
Yeah.

689
00:16:24,641 --> 00:16:25,570
That's a weird one.

690
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:26,470
Yeah.

691
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:30,010
When you think about how many people
are prescribed these things and then

692
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:35,040
there's not really a direct understanding
of how it impacts each p East person.

693
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:36,071
They'll tell you,

694
00:16:36,071 --> 00:16:36,311
hey,

695
00:16:36,311 --> 00:16:38,320
we'll try this medication
and if it doesn't work,

696
00:16:38,321 --> 00:16:39,154
we'll try another one.

697
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:39,670
Yeah.

698
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:40,331
Does this one work?

699
00:16:40,331 --> 00:16:41,200
We'll just cycle through it.

700
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:45,700
And how do you know if it's working for
you or if you're having a good time in

701
00:16:45,701 --> 00:16:48,880
your life and so you're feeling
better because maybe you started a new

702
00:16:48,881 --> 00:16:51,110
relationship and a new
job and it's going wow.

703
00:16:51,111 --> 00:16:51,791
And Hey,

704
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:52,500
it just a,

705
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:53,620
everything seems pretty good.

706
00:16:53,621 --> 00:16:58,030
I was on medications that made me nauseous
for a year and a half before I was

707
00:16:58,031 --> 00:16:58,181
like,

708
00:16:58,181 --> 00:16:59,014
you know what?

709
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:02,890
I literally thought I was nauseous
because I was eating too many lifesavers.

710
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:04,540
Not even fucking kidding.

711
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:05,471
Literally I was like,

712
00:17:05,471 --> 00:17:10,060
I gotta take it easy on these life savers
because every night I throw up on the

713
00:17:10,061 --> 00:17:12,850
way to the laugh factory
and then I realized like,

714
00:17:12,851 --> 00:17:13,271
you know,

715
00:17:13,271 --> 00:17:13,960
Neil,

716
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:16,510
you're taking a pretty
high dosage of Zoloft,

717
00:17:16,511 --> 00:17:18,370
or you might want to just
take it down a notch.

718
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:23,440
That Zoloft stuff is supposed to be
really weird for your discerning of what

719
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:25,120
matters and what doesn't matter.

720
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:25,800
Like,

721
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,130
like it's hard to,

722
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:29,320
I've never done it so it's,

723
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:30,520
it's hard for me to describe it.

724
00:17:30,521 --> 00:17:31,030
But yeah,

725
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:33,040
the people that I've talked
to that had done it and said,

726
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:38,430
one of the issues that they had with
it is nothing had the bad things,

727
00:17:39,011 --> 00:17:40,570
didn't feel bad anymore,

728
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,400
but the good things
didn't feel good either.

729
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:45,400
Well that's thing with a lot
of antidepressants is they,

730
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:46,293
they raise the,

731
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:49,830
the floor and they also the ceiling,

732
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:50,970
we'll so that it,

733
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:53,910
it narrows your band of
experience basically.

734
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:54,900
Whew.

735
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:55,410
Uh,

736
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:55,771
which,

737
00:17:55,771 --> 00:17:57,420
but if you're severely depressed,

738
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:58,560
it can be very like,

739
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:02,940
like ketamine apparently
is a lifesaver truly for,

740
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:05,490
they may start administering it in,

741
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:06,413
uh,

742
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:08,730
in emergency rooms for suicide cases.

743
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:09,330
Really?

744
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:09,660
Yeah.

745
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:10,440
Cause it does,

746
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,040
it's dry.

747
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,330
I mean it's a basic,

748
00:18:12,331 --> 00:18:12,601
a whole,

749
00:18:12,601 --> 00:18:13,890
it's a hallucinogen.

750
00:18:13,891 --> 00:18:14,680
So you know,

751
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,070
hallucinogens well makes you like,

752
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,011
it,

753
00:18:17,011 --> 00:18:17,281
see,

754
00:18:17,281 --> 00:18:17,940
thinks differently.

755
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:19,410
So there's starting to,

756
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:20,853
uh,

757
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,700
I at least they're talking
about administering it as a,

758
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:24,211
as a,

759
00:18:24,211 --> 00:18:24,990
uh,

760
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:25,291
sort of,

761
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:25,490
uh,

762
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:26,071
almost like,

763
00:18:26,071 --> 00:18:26,850
uh,

764
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:28,710
whatever that drug is that you can do.

765
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:30,180
Almost like an Epi pen for,

766
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:30,571
for,

767
00:18:30,571 --> 00:18:31,230
uh,

768
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:34,820
for suicide victims towards
suicide thought thinkers,

769
00:18:34,821 --> 00:18:35,171
thinkers,

770
00:18:35,171 --> 00:18:35,430
or,

771
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:35,820
yeah,

772
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:36,600
I'm about to do it.

773
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,433
Yeah.

774
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:38,370
Um,

775
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:38,881
so yeah,

776
00:18:38,881 --> 00:18:39,240
so the,

777
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,170
so the tms,

778
00:18:40,171 --> 00:18:41,520
transcranial magnetic stimulation,

779
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:42,960
half an hour of that,

780
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:43,801
of that debt,

781
00:18:43,801 --> 00:18:44,180
that debt,

782
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:44,730
that debt,

783
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:47,670
the debt doesn't feel like much,

784
00:18:47,671 --> 00:18:48,504
feels like a,

785
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,000
like a Shitty Woodpecker,

786
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:55,260
like a fucking sleepy woodpecker
is sort of going at your head,

787
00:18:55,261 --> 00:18:55,861
but you're not like,

788
00:18:55,861 --> 00:18:56,161
Hey,

789
00:18:56,161 --> 00:18:56,641
get out of here.

790
00:18:56,641 --> 00:18:56,761
Well,

791
00:18:56,761 --> 00:18:57,331
you're just kind of like,

792
00:18:57,331 --> 00:18:57,970
okay,

793
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:58,441
okay.

794
00:18:58,441 --> 00:18:59,160
Huh.

795
00:18:59,160 --> 00:18:59,671
How much longer?

796
00:18:59,671 --> 00:19:00,060
And you,

797
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:01,350
I would just sit there and watch TV.

798
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:03,000
Um,

799
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,170
and how many times he's supposed to do it.

800
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:06,060
I do it 40 times.

801
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:08,520
Four zero four zero times.

802
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:09,270
Half an hour.

803
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:10,530
And how deep are you in right now?

804
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:11,370
I'm done.

805
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:12,240
I finished it.

806
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:12,921
Yeah,

807
00:19:12,921 --> 00:19:14,670
I did all 40 in the fall.

808
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:15,300
Wow.

809
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:15,691
And,

810
00:19:15,691 --> 00:19:16,050
uh,

811
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:19,470
and I'm telling you it lasted and um,

812
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:21,090
and you can go back for,

813
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:21,810
for,

814
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:22,410
um,

815
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:24,570
like sort of pick me ups every,

816
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:25,860
whenever you feel like you need it.

817
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:27,210
Um,

818
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:30,990
so I'm telling you like this is the
thing that has worked best for me better

819
00:19:30,991 --> 00:19:32,230
than ketamine if way,

820
00:19:32,231 --> 00:19:33,001
but better than,

821
00:19:33,001 --> 00:19:33,631
than Zoloft.

822
00:19:33,631 --> 00:19:34,464
Better than healing.

823
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:35,490
I was on,

824
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:36,030
uh,

825
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:37,020
what's an Ssri?

826
00:19:37,021 --> 00:19:41,160
Is this a strategic Sarah to selective
Serotonin reuptake inhibitor?

827
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:42,030
Um,

828
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:43,080
and uh,

829
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:44,820
and went off at once.

830
00:19:44,821 --> 00:19:46,350
I did this magnet shit.

831
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:46,890
So you know,

832
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:47,723
you're off everything.

833
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:48,150
Yeah.

834
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:48,790
Wow.

835
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:49,260
Yeah.

836
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:50,093
And you feel great.

837
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:50,580
Yeah.

838
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:51,413
Just no joy.

839
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:52,230
Well,

840
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:52,830
no joy,

841
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:54,170
but that's not what,

842
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:55,470
he never had it.

843
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,450
You didn't lose nothing.

844
00:19:57,690 --> 00:19:58,590
I just look at you.

845
00:19:58,590 --> 00:19:58,711
Yeah,

846
00:19:58,711 --> 00:19:59,790
you kids have fun.

847
00:19:59,791 --> 00:20:00,624
I'll be over here.

848
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:01,471
Yeah.

849
00:20:01,471 --> 00:20:01,821
But it's not,

850
00:20:01,821 --> 00:20:03,390
I'm not miserable and I'm not also,

851
00:20:03,391 --> 00:20:05,340
there's no physical manifestation.

852
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:06,840
That's the biggest thing.

853
00:20:06,841 --> 00:20:07,020
The,

854
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:07,250
the,

855
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:08,310
the head thing,

856
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:10,650
the feeling like there
was a plate on my head.

857
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:13,080
Getting rid of that was really,

858
00:20:13,081 --> 00:20:13,531
really,

859
00:20:13,531 --> 00:20:14,310
really great.

860
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:16,230
So when you say like a plate on your head,

861
00:20:16,231 --> 00:20:18,120
like there was a pressure or,

862
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:18,420
yeah,

863
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:19,590
I have a little weight,

864
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,420
a little weight and a little pressure.

865
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,670
Did you ever nervous when I went in there?

866
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:24,570
No,

867
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:26,940
because there were times
where I'd go off of uh,

868
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:32,030
antidepressants and I have my jaw muscles
and muscles in my temple would be so

869
00:20:32,581 --> 00:20:35,950
tight that I'd need to use
like a massager well on them.

870
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:38,040
So I knew that there was all,

871
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:39,330
it was all sort of connected.

872
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:40,580
Um,

873
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:40,881
you got,

874
00:20:40,881 --> 00:20:42,090
you do ding on.

875
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:42,841
Is that,

876
00:20:42,841 --> 00:20:45,810
was that pretty sure that my thing,

877
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:46,873
unless it's me,

878
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:47,441
it might've,

879
00:20:47,441 --> 00:20:48,274
is there name bro?

880
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:49,210
[inaudible]

881
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:50,043
Bro.

882
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:50,550
Yeah.

883
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:50,800
Was,

884
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:50,950
yeah.

885
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:52,360
Was Your Day fuck up there?

886
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:53,253
Okay.

887
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:54,693
Um,

888
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:56,043
so,

889
00:20:56,170 --> 00:20:57,230
so that was a big one.

890
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,420
That was really helpful.

891
00:20:58,421 --> 00:21:00,710
Then I did a,

892
00:21:00,711 --> 00:21:02,050
I was in New York for a couple of months.

893
00:21:02,051 --> 00:21:03,400
Did that show three mikes?

894
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:04,090
Um,

895
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:05,740
which I think I told you the premise,

896
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:06,120
the,

897
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:06,311
yeah,

898
00:21:06,311 --> 00:21:06,851
you told me,

899
00:21:06,851 --> 00:21:07,310
but tell him,

900
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:07,890
say it.

901
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:10,270
So the premise is onstage,

902
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:12,910
I put three Mikes equidistant
apart from each other.

903
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:15,190
One is for stand up,

904
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:19,150
one is for one liners that I
just couldn't fit anywhere.

905
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:24,570
And then one is for true sort of
emotional confessions type shit.

906
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,130
Talking about depression,

907
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:30,310
talking about a shit with my dad.

908
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,473
Um,

909
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,940
like the sort of the,

910
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,660
I won't spoil the surprise but pretty
heavy shit between my me and my dad when

911
00:21:37,661 --> 00:21:39,610
he died or right before he died.

912
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:40,930
And,

913
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:42,010
and then the,

914
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,720
and then the second monologue is about,

915
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:44,613
um,

916
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,880
kind of about like celebrity and,

917
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:47,630
and,

918
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:48,520
and dealing with,

919
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:53,020
with having a partner and then break it
up and become my own guy and all that

920
00:21:53,021 --> 00:21:53,854
shit.

921
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,750
So it's basically like,

922
00:21:55,751 --> 00:21:58,690
it ends up being probably
40 minutes to stand up,

923
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:03,750
45 stand up in a half hour of true stories
and then five minutes of one liners.

924
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:07,140
And did you do it after you
had completed your treatment?

925
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:08,303
I did,

926
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,300
yes.

927
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:10,350
I did it after,

928
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:10,651
yeah.

929
00:22:10,651 --> 00:22:13,800
And in the middle of it I actually stopped
taking everything and in the middle

930
00:22:13,801 --> 00:22:15,840
of recording or practice in the middle of,

931
00:22:15,841 --> 00:22:15,991
no,

932
00:22:15,991 --> 00:22:17,010
in the middle of the run,

933
00:22:17,011 --> 00:22:18,900
I had an eight week run,

934
00:22:18,901 --> 00:22:19,531
I think in New York.

935
00:22:19,531 --> 00:22:19,741
And,

936
00:22:19,741 --> 00:22:20,574
uh,

937
00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:23,640
and I stopped everything
in the middle of it.

938
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,110
It's not like suddenly just like,

939
00:22:25,111 --> 00:22:25,980
I don't think I need it.

940
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:26,790
Wow.

941
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:27,480
Yeah.

942
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:27,721
Now,

943
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:28,380
what were the,

944
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:31,350
what's the difference when
you get off medication?

945
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:32,240
What was the,

946
00:22:32,241 --> 00:22:34,560
the difference in the way
your brain was functioning?

947
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:40,230
I can almost tell how well my brain's
functioning if I'm not depressed or not

948
00:22:41,591 --> 00:22:42,760
slowed down by depression.

949
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:45,040
My associations are much quicker.

950
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:48,550
Like if you're just like
the simplest thing of like,

951
00:22:48,551 --> 00:22:51,700
that guy looks like so and so like,

952
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:51,970
uh,

953
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:53,040
sort of a little roast,

954
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,870
like a little like what is that shirt
fucking looks like the kind of shirt you

955
00:22:56,170 --> 00:22:56,411
like.

956
00:22:56,411 --> 00:22:57,460
If I'm not depressed,

957
00:22:57,461 --> 00:22:58,750
I can think of those quickly.

958
00:22:59,340 --> 00:22:59,620
Uh,

959
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:00,580
if I'm depressed,

960
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:03,850
there were times where I'd get
depression would affect my memory,

961
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:06,220
where I couldn't remember the,

962
00:23:06,221 --> 00:23:06,500
the,

963
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:06,850
the,

964
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:11,590
the test I would always do in my
head is there's a guy who directed,

965
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:14,590
gone with a win and the
wizard of Oz back to back.

966
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:15,910
Jesus.

967
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:16,480
Yeah.

968
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:16,960
Uh,

969
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,190
and I would try to remember his name.

970
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:19,420
His name's Victor Fleming,

971
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:21,160
but if I was depressed,

972
00:23:21,161 --> 00:23:21,994
I couldn't remember it.

973
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,070
Like it affects your fucking,

974
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,353
do you think

975
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:26,373
resource thing,

976
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:31,150
like your brain is so concentrating on
the depression and feeling like shit that

977
00:23:31,151 --> 00:23:32,890
just doesn't have the resources

978
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:33,610
think it,

979
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:36,800
I tend to think it's
more a dead sinaps thing.

980
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:37,610
Hmm.

981
00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:38,480
And I think it's a,

982
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:40,070
I think it's an energy.

983
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:43,130
I think depression is a
lack of energy in the brain.

984
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,120
So,

985
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:44,960
and maybe you're right.

986
00:23:44,961 --> 00:23:45,500
Maybe it is.

987
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,090
It's all going to one place,

988
00:23:47,091 --> 00:23:49,010
but that's my own personal
interpretation of it.

989
00:23:58,770 --> 00:23:58,830
Okay.
