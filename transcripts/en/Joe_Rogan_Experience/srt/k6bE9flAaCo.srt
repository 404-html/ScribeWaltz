1
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:28,010
Brian,
Brian.

2
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:28,620
Brian,

3
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,700
that's a good God damn fucking song.
Brian,

4
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:34,650
do you like it?
You know how to pick Mike Posner?

5
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:39,980
Mike Posner.
This is the guy who became famous over 

6
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:39,980
the Internet.
Yes.

7
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:39,980
Wow,
that's pretty good.

8
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:43,070
We got aol instant messenger going on in
the background or something.

9
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:46,890
I don't know what it is.
Ladies and gentlemen,

10
00:01:46,891 --> 00:01:49,750
thank you very much once again for 
tuning in to the,

11
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:52,980
to the podcast.
As always,

12
00:01:52,981 --> 00:01:57,981
we're sponsored by fleshlight.
My special guest today is Rick 

13
00:01:57,981 --> 00:01:57,981
Schroeder.
Ladies,

14
00:01:57,981 --> 00:02:02,151
gentlemen,
Rick Schroeder from a million different 

15
00:02:02,551 --> 00:02:07,551
things.
The first time I was ever exposed to 

16
00:02:07,551 --> 00:02:07,551
you.
I was a little kid and um,

17
00:02:07,551 --> 00:02:10,290
my step father took me to see the champ 
and I cried like a bitch.

18
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:11,580
Real.
Oh,

19
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,750
lots of good stories.

20
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,750
I'm remaking that.
Are you doing it again?

21
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:22,440
Really in the world?
Hopefully your world in the MMA world.

22
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,210
Wow.
Dana's got it.

23
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:25,530
Really?
Wow.

24
00:02:25,531 --> 00:02:26,170
Wow.
Holy Shit.

25
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:27,600
Awesome.
Yeah,

26
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:30,700
but you can't have the desk though.
She's never going to go.

27
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:33,120
Really?
The why.

28
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:35,650
Why?
Because I'm the way.

29
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:40,710
I got a written.
He has a preexisting condition from the 

30
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:43,721
motorcycle accident.
That's why he died because he takes a 

31
00:02:43,721 --> 00:02:47,810
blow to the head crafty Hollywood people
just know what a trick us.

32
00:02:47,811 --> 00:02:48,700
The champion.
Do you ever.

33
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:49,970
You ever seen one of these things 
before?

34
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:55,720
No.
This is the flashlight and what it is 

35
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:55,720
is,
you know,

36
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:59,470
some masturbation technology device.
It's a to make jerking off better.

37
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:05,380
And for you,
and this is a collect the fluid there 

38
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:07,510
and nobody's had sex touch it.
Is it collect the fluid in the bottom or

39
00:03:07,511 --> 00:03:07,790
something?
Yeah,

40
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,380
yeah,
yeah.

41
00:03:08,381 --> 00:03:10,900
This is what I say.
The recycle will you released it?

42
00:03:10,901 --> 00:03:14,080
Cracking of shame is how I describe it.
Go like that.

43
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:18,520
It just slid.
There's that fish in the bucket for this

44
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:20,170
is called fishing in the bucket.
Ladies and gentlemen,

45
00:03:20,171 --> 00:03:23,200
for you watching on Itunes,
when you pull this flashlight out,

46
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:23,860
it's,
you know,

47
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:28,870
it's really soft,
fake vagina material and so when you 

48
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:32,350
pull it out of this tube that looks like
a flashlight to see what looks like,

49
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:32,960
you know,
the,

50
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:36,100
the actual devices,
like it looks like a jellyfish sort of a

51
00:03:36,101 --> 00:03:36,890
thing.
Wow.

52
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,140
What does that retail for?
Man?

53
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,210
I think it's like 60 bucks or something 
like that,

54
00:03:40,211 --> 00:03:43,870
but if you order through my website,
you get 15 percent off supposedly.

55
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:46,810
Supposedly we got to figure out how that
works to make sure,

56
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:49,690
but hopefully they're selling them 
because the fucking things work.

57
00:03:49,691 --> 00:03:51,300
Man.
You know everybody beats off.

58
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:57,490
Have I tried it just like today?
You haven't fucked it today.

59
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:01,150
Why would you try it?
You have the most beautiful life.

60
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:04,870
I know.
Wife getting crazy.

61
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:11,360
Just be realistic.
You have to be able to use your mind on 

62
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,000
occasion.
You can't always fuck the same person or

63
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:16,030
someone else with your brain.
Flashlight does not talk.

64
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:19,630
Yeah.
It's not even that.

65
00:04:19,631 --> 00:04:21,310
It's just like there's times where you 
just.

66
00:04:21,311 --> 00:04:26,311
It's like a maintenance thing.
You just gotta just gotTa beat off like 

67
00:04:26,311 --> 00:04:26,710
you don't want to have sex.
You don't have to time to get intimate.

68
00:04:26,711 --> 00:04:29,290
You just like,
I need to get rid of some loads here.

69
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:32,350
Bam.
I can understand that.

70
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:37,380
You know when you're 18 in the shower in
the morning and brush your teeth Jack 

71
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:37,380
off,
you don't understand that as a group,

72
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:38,380
but I don't understand that as a four 
year old,

73
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:41,110
it just.
I think my hgh levels crashed.

74
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:42,730
Oh,
you got to start doing squat.

75
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:45,470
Going to get on them.
Dead lifts.

76
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:47,170
Son Handle Bells,
man.

77
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,970
Rick Schroeder just started doing 
Jujitsu.

78
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,650
He is taking it now and you've been 
taking it for like three days.

79
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:57,540
I've had four classes,
four days with Eddie.

80
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,700
Eddie Bravo.
He's a brick.

81
00:05:00,701 --> 00:05:03,970
Shoulders learning has strangled pitch.
Have you had ringworm yet about that?

82
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:07,360
Listen,
I got some soap for you.

83
00:05:07,361 --> 00:05:08,470
I'm going to give it to you before we 
leave.

84
00:05:08,471 --> 00:05:10,270
I wanted to have it out for the podcast,
but I forgot.

85
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:12,760
It's called defense soap that you can go
to.

86
00:05:12,761 --> 00:05:16,330
Defense soap.com.
I have no affiliation with them.

87
00:05:16,331 --> 00:05:19,270
The guy who owns it,
guy soccer was just this really cool guy

88
00:05:19,271 --> 00:05:24,070
who made this great product and it's all
about keeping your skin healthy when you

89
00:05:24,071 --> 00:05:26,210
do Jujitsu because when you do Jujitsu,
you're.

90
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:28,930
You're getting scratched and you're 
rolling around.

91
00:05:28,931 --> 00:05:33,931
There's a lot of abrasions all over your
body and if you don't wash with a good 

92
00:05:33,931 --> 00:05:35,880
healthy soap,
you can have like you getting infections

93
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:37,960
like ringworm and people don't tell you 
about.

94
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:42,960
It's fucking really annoying.
You have to find out from other people 

95
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,231
that do Jujitsu.
Like my friend already had a staph 

96
00:05:46,231 --> 00:05:46,270
infection on his knee and his knee had 
swollen up.

97
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:51,750
We were playing pool and he's walking 
around the pool table with this like 

98
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:51,750
weird lump.
So I go,

99
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:52,570
what's going on man?
And he goes,

100
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,800
I got a spider bite.
And I go,

101
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:54,850
Oh shit,
let me see it.

102
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:56,370
So he pulls his pants up.
I go to,

103
00:05:56,390 --> 00:06:01,390
that's a staph infection.
He thought it was a spider bite because 

104
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:04,361
it was this big pus filled red mark.
It looked like he had gotten poisoned 

105
00:06:04,361 --> 00:06:04,361
with something you looked like.
There was like,

106
00:06:04,361 --> 00:06:05,210
you know,
in Arizona.

107
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:10,570
So if I had noticed that it probably 
could have got systemic and he would've 

108
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:14,270
had to been in the hospital with ivy 
intravenous antibiotics.

109
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:15,680
It's really,
really dangerous stuff.

110
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:18,760
What's the ringworm thing?
Is that to say no?

111
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:19,850
It's called.
No,

112
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:23,360
it's the same thing as athlete's foot.
It's really the same exact fungus.

113
00:06:23,361 --> 00:06:26,510
It's just different parts of your body 
and what ringworm is.

114
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:28,760
It's like it grows and it looks like a 
ring,

115
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:30,200
you know,
when it starts to infect you,

116
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:33,010
like a big circle on your body and 
that's how you crop circles.

117
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:33,910
Skin.
Yeah.

118
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:38,950
It's usually in circles.
So there's some knowledge at the gym 

119
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:38,950
that you will need to.
I mean,

120
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:41,430
you don't want a sweaty guys on top of 
you.

121
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:44,540
Kind of.
It was weird to get married at first.

122
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,540
It's weird as fuck man.
I know,

123
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,710
but I do it.
I think of it,

124
00:06:48,711 --> 00:06:53,711
you know,
you don't even think of it really as a 

125
00:06:53,711 --> 00:06:53,711
dude.
You think of it as like a problem.

126
00:06:53,711 --> 00:06:53,711
You think of it as like,
here's this,

127
00:06:53,711 --> 00:06:58,660
you know,
there's this thing that's moving around 

128
00:06:58,660 --> 00:06:58,660
that I have to dissect,
you know,

129
00:06:58,660 --> 00:06:59,810
I have to,
I have to dissect this guy,

130
00:06:59,811 --> 00:07:04,811
I have to,
I have to figure out how to lock them 

131
00:07:04,811 --> 00:07:05,120
down and figure out how to hold them in 
place to figure out how to take his arm.

132
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:07,460
You've got what happened?
They're major volume.

133
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:08,620
Boom.
What'd you do that,

134
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:10,340
Brian?
Now my volume is gone.

135
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:11,580
Your body's gone.
Yeah.

136
00:07:11,581 --> 00:07:14,060
You just fucked with something.
There you go.

137
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:16,480
That's all sensitive.
Well,

138
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:19,550
Mine's way loud.
I'm going to back off the mic.

139
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:23,000
Back off the mic.
So I'm loving the Jujitsu.

140
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:24,340
Yeah.
So Rick showed is out.

141
00:07:24,341 --> 00:07:26,620
They're strangling bitches.
You got tapped by your own son now.

142
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:28,160
That's sad.
Really.

143
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,740
I coulda coulda gotten.
I could have gotten them all right.

144
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:35,750
I should have got them.
Then the next time it will tell you 

145
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:35,750
something.
You have kids.

146
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:36,890
You can't let them tap you.
My other son,

147
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:42,150
he actually did get me.
Holden seems like a,

148
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:47,230
he's a big,
strong strapping fellow and he's just 

149
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:47,990
starting to come into that.
So he's like really into it.

150
00:07:47,991 --> 00:07:49,400
You know when I talked to him about your
Jitsu,

151
00:07:49,401 --> 00:07:49,970
I was like,
dude,

152
00:07:49,971 --> 00:07:50,810
you would love it.

153
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:54,080
He would love it.
And He needs that gym in Salt Lake.

154
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,070
Yeah.
He'll.

155
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:57,410
Jeremy Horn has a gym in Salt Lake.
He's going there for college,

156
00:07:57,411 --> 00:07:57,730
right?
Yeah.

157
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:00,580
He just went there last week,
so he needs to go.

158
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,220
Well,
we'll get them.

159
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,070
We'll get them set up with Jeremy 
Because Jeremy has got a killer.

160
00:08:04,071 --> 00:08:06,560
Jim and Jeremy is like a really good 
coach.

161
00:08:06,561 --> 00:08:11,561
He's like,
one of the best guys you could ever 

162
00:08:11,561 --> 00:08:11,561
learn from.
Jeremy has always been like,

163
00:08:11,561 --> 00:08:12,200
not,
not like a physically talented guy.

164
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,690
He's not a natural athlete,
not like super strong,

165
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:18,170
explosive.
Just really smart and really technical,

166
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,780
you know,
that's what he's always been like.

167
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,950
He's always been real clever on the 
ground,

168
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:25,250
was just a great guy to learn from.
Those are the best guys to learn from.

169
00:08:25,251 --> 00:08:30,251
The guys that are really strong 
sometimes they're getting away with a 

170
00:08:30,251 --> 00:08:33,371
lot of it is just through athleticism 
and they're not quite as technical as 

171
00:08:33,371 --> 00:08:33,371
the guys who are like naturally not that
strong.

172
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:38,540
It was the best guys to learn from.
Jeremy wanted one of the nicest guys in 

173
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:38,540
the world.
Cool.

174
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:39,590
So hold them to love it.
He's going to be a killer.

175
00:08:39,591 --> 00:08:44,591
It's going to come back.
There's gonna always a beach already 

176
00:08:44,591 --> 00:08:44,591
going to get you.
He's already a still.

177
00:08:44,591 --> 00:08:46,390
What did he tap you with?
Um,

178
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,460
it was an arm.
It was an arm bar.

179
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:54,830
He got me in and um,
and luke got me on a regional not,

180
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:57,120
yeah,
but I,

181
00:08:57,121 --> 00:08:59,820
I know my son and I could feel the 
emotion,

182
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:01,710
like the boys and their dads have this 
thing,

183
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,290
like especially when boys turns like 18,
19,

184
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:06,060
20,
they have to go through this thing where

185
00:09:06,061 --> 00:09:09,330
they have to push their dad's away for 
some reason.

186
00:09:09,331 --> 00:09:14,331
It's part of the natural transition into
manhood and he was going,

187
00:09:15,091 --> 00:09:20,091
he's going through that right now 
because he's 18 and I could tell he 

188
00:09:20,091 --> 00:09:20,510
wanted to hurt me,
so I knew I needed to.

189
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:22,940
I knew I needed to just.
That's so crazy.

190
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:23,490
Yeah.
And I said,

191
00:09:23,491 --> 00:09:25,020
I tapped and he goes,
you can't tap.

192
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:26,880
I said,
no.

193
00:09:26,881 --> 00:09:27,360
I said,
hold on.

194
00:09:27,361 --> 00:09:28,830
I tapped.
He's like,

195
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:33,920
oh,
he just wanted to know how he didn't 

196
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,651
want you to take a moment to tap.
Why would he not want you to tap if you 

197
00:09:36,651 --> 00:09:37,140
got you got you want to break your arm?

198
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:38,790
Well,
I don't think he wanted to break my arm,

199
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:41,040
but that's what happens when you don't 
get the tap.

200
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:44,490
You just want to give me a little more 
pain before I tapped out.

201
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,140
Wow.
That's fucking weird,

202
00:09:46,141 --> 00:09:47,670
man.
I don't know how I'd handle that.

203
00:09:47,671 --> 00:09:52,671
I'd have to beat the fuck out of him.
I think I might have to beat the fuck 

204
00:09:52,671 --> 00:09:52,671
out of him.
You're lucky you have girls.

205
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:55,500
Don't know how to deal with that.
I'm going to have to choke that dude.

206
00:09:56,280 --> 00:10:01,280
I might have to be loaded.
We're going to figure some shit out 

207
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:01,280
here.
No Damn.

208
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:06,430
Don't want to have to go through that.
Some fucking young buck running around 

209
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:09,620
your house,
his chest puffed out and not listening 

210
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:09,620
to you.
Oh,

211
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:09,620
well,
you know what?

212
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:12,600
You got to put the hooks in some other 
way.

213
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:13,990
I got to get through to him.

214
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:21,050
Just squeeze them out.
You've got to be able to consistently 

215
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:21,090
squeeze them out.
That's what's most important.

216
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:23,430
You can't just squeeze them out every 
third time.

217
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,810
You've got to be able to squeeze them 
out.

218
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:29,870
Every time you guys fuck out.
I'm going to get Eddie's Mondays and 

219
00:10:30,511 --> 00:10:32,740
Wednesdays for the next six months and 
I'm gonna.

220
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:35,820
Learn some serious technique you can use
and he and I are going to.

221
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:37,200
We're gonna.
Go after it again.

222
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:39,540
Eventually we'll.
This is what you need to do.

223
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,420
All you need to do is be consistent,
be consistent.

224
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:47,750
That's the most important thing.
Be Consistent and spar a lot and get on 

225
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:48,960
some sort of a strength program.
Get unlike lifting.

226
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,450
Kettle bells were the best because 
they're really lightweight.

227
00:10:51,451 --> 00:10:53,130
You can do it with like a 30 pound 
Kettlebell,

228
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,230
35 pound kettle bell.
You get a tremendous workout.

229
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,520
I have one workout that I do.

230
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:58,770
It's just 1:35
pound kettle bell.

231
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:01,920
You called it the farmer strength.
You're using your,

232
00:11:01,921 --> 00:11:06,921
your use your whole body and it just 
forces you to use everything like 

233
00:11:06,921 --> 00:11:09,390
athletically as opposed to like like 
just bench pressing,

234
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:14,460
isolating or twice as stuff doesn't 
really enhance your ability to move 

235
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:18,621
things.
It's like when you have like something 

236
00:11:18,621 --> 00:11:18,621
that you have to control and you have to
balance it.

237
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:21,030
Then you develop like a different kind 
of a strength,

238
00:11:21,031 --> 00:11:24,750
a strength that has like stability and 
balance and strength and muscle.

239
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:29,930
Muscle groups using muscles adjust when 
things are going wrong and when you're 

240
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:30,570
getting tired,
you know that's what's really important.

241
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:35,780
You do that,
you'll choke the fuck out of that kid 

242
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:35,780
that I'm talking about.
That little mother fucker shut up.

243
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,280
You got to be able to get them all the 
time.

244
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:39,930
It's very important,
man.

245
00:11:39,931 --> 00:11:44,931
You have to let him know that every time
you roll you're going to choke the fuck 

246
00:11:44,931 --> 00:11:44,931
out of them.

247
00:11:44,931 --> 00:11:47,360
That's is a foregone conclusion.
There are certain dudes that you can you

248
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:52,400
just own.
Like when I first started doing Jujitsu 

249
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,330
was this kid who was his purple belt who
really good and this dude owned me.

250
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,640
Every time we rolled he owned me.
It was a foregone conclusion I was going

251
00:11:59,641 --> 00:12:00,700
to tap.
I sucked.

252
00:12:00,701 --> 00:12:05,701
I was a white belt.
I didn't know what I was doing and he 

253
00:12:05,701 --> 00:12:07,801
was a really good purple belt.
He was strong as fuck and he used to 

254
00:12:07,801 --> 00:12:08,470
like to run through me.
That's what we would like to do.

255
00:12:08,471 --> 00:12:12,760
Just fucking squash me as quick as he 
could and it was like God damn.

256
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:14,650
But there was,
but you kept it as an order.

257
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:15,490
Yeah.
Well He,

258
00:12:15,491 --> 00:12:17,740
you know,
he left and I went to another school,

259
00:12:17,741 --> 00:12:21,610
the school that we were at close now.
But the important thing was I knew every

260
00:12:21,611 --> 00:12:23,350
time I rolled with that guy,
unless I got way,

261
00:12:23,351 --> 00:12:24,310
way,
way better,

262
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:26,020
get way better than I was.

263
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:27,730
That guy was gonna fuck me up every 
time.

264
00:12:27,731 --> 00:12:32,731
So there's like,
I didn't want to roll with them because 

265
00:12:32,731 --> 00:12:32,731
he owned me.
Know what I'm saying?

266
00:12:32,731 --> 00:12:33,970
You got to own your kid.
Little mother fucker.

267
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:38,300
Just shut the fuck up.
That's what you gotta do.

268
00:12:38,301 --> 00:12:43,301
Do a lot of it's psyching out too.
You might want to shave a Mohawk and 

269
00:12:43,301 --> 00:12:46,330
stuff like spitting on him and get some 
potassium outside.

270
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:48,730
Someone that Mike Tyson face.
Tattoos.

271
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:53,030
Hold your gun sideways.
Fix Roads in town.

272
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:55,270
Mother fucker.
What they say?

273
00:12:55,271 --> 00:12:58,130
God didn't make them an equal.
Smith and Wesson did well,

274
00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:03,170
you know,
rick is a very unusual Hollywood guy.

275
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,100
You're not,
um,

276
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:10,160
you know,
everybody wants to say that like he's 

277
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:10,160
not a Hollywood guy,
but you're not a Hollywood guy.

278
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,710
You're a dude who had a ranch out in 
Colorado.

279
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:16,600
I know you love to hunt like you love a 
lot of like manly shit.

280
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:18,940
Jujitsu is right up your alley.
Told him that.

281
00:13:18,941 --> 00:13:21,730
I mean like I spear gun hunt.
He,

282
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:27,240
he got back from Africa and showed them 
all this fucking shitty killed one on a 

283
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,200
great safari with my son.
A fly airplane taking me.

284
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:32,230
We're going to go pig hunting.
We just have to figure out what was more

285
00:13:32,231 --> 00:13:33,790
than pigs.
Actually we're going to do some.

286
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:36,100
We're going to do a buffalo.
I'm not doing anything.

287
00:13:36,101 --> 00:13:39,100
I can't eat bison.
Bison,

288
00:13:39,101 --> 00:13:41,410
you can,
but I'm just saying you guys kill Shit.

289
00:13:41,411 --> 00:13:46,411
You can't eat.
He's going to eat everything that he 

290
00:13:46,411 --> 00:13:48,691
killed.
The only shit that I can't that would 

291
00:13:48,691 --> 00:13:50,311
kill that.
A kidney is like shit that I think like 

292
00:13:50,311 --> 00:13:50,680
coyotes to kill cats and shit.
I could kill a coyote.

293
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,180
You know,
like I've had cats.

294
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:54,490
I've had my,
you know,

295
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,410
my dog had killed by mountain lion in 
Colorado.

296
00:13:56,490 --> 00:13:58,540
What are we going hunting?
What do you have time?

297
00:13:58,541 --> 00:14:03,541
We're going to figure it out right after
my book was supposed to be done with my 

298
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:06,031
book by October 15th because November 
it'll be cooler and we can hunt deer,

299
00:14:06,761 --> 00:14:08,830
right?
We can hunt deer pig.

300
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:10,690
Dude.
I like the way deer taste.

301
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:15,930
I want to do it because I've been a 
mediator my entire life and I've taken 

302
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:17,680
no responsibility for my desire to 
consume me.

303
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:22,480
I have not felt any remorse from pulling
the trigger and seeing an animal die.

304
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:27,510
I haven't made a connection,
a real connection between what you're 

305
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:27,910
doing when you're eating meat and I 
think as a person who thinks,

306
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:31,390
I think that's actually probably 
important to try out an important,

307
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:35,350
you know,
hunting gathering was our past with some

308
00:14:35,351 --> 00:14:36,520
men,
especially hunting,

309
00:14:36,521 --> 00:14:41,521
gathering and like the further we get 
away from that and that vibe of hunting 

310
00:14:41,521 --> 00:14:45,100
and gathering and providing and testing 
ourselves like that.

311
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:50,370
I think the more out of touch we're 
becoming with who we are leading a 

312
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:50,370
great.
I think that is.

313
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:52,340
I think the world and technology

314
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:57,340
have evolved faster than people and I 
think there's certain reward systems 

315
00:14:57,340 --> 00:15:01,030
that are set up in the human mind to 
ensure that we're going to continue to 

316
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:05,351
do certain things like that.
We're going to continue to want to fuck 

317
00:15:05,351 --> 00:15:08,110
that.
We're going to tend to continue to want 

318
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:08,110
to hunt like you get like a response 
from hunting.

319
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:09,680
I know I do from fishing.
I've never been hunting,

320
00:15:09,681 --> 00:15:14,681
but I've been fishing and there's some 
primal thing about pulling a big fish 

321
00:15:14,681 --> 00:15:16,790
out of the water that knowing that 
you're going to eat this thing,

322
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:19,850
like you just went out into the wild 
another world,

323
00:15:19,851 --> 00:15:21,880
okay.
Floating around on the fucking ocean and

324
00:15:21,881 --> 00:15:24,560
you pulled something out of that world 
and now you're going to eat it.

325
00:15:24,561 --> 00:15:26,990
It's going to give you life.
There's a little.

326
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:30,410
There's energy that's attached to that 
like you feel good about it.

327
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:30,870
Well,
you know,

328
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,240
if the truth is of hunting and 
gathering,

329
00:15:32,241 --> 00:15:33,590
societies had succeeded.

330
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:39,110
They haven't succeeded because they were
replaced by mass farm production 

331
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:42,320
societies plus changed everything.
We changed everything was the ability to

332
00:15:42,321 --> 00:15:47,321
stay in one place.
People have like this sort of a nomadic 

333
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:50,680
genetic connection.
There's a guy who lives in Alaska and 

334
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,220
they chronicled him on.
You ever see VBS DOT TV?

335
00:15:52,221 --> 00:15:53,420
You ever go to that website?
No.

336
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:55,610
Fucking phenomenal website.
This is.

337
00:15:55,850 --> 00:16:00,250
There's a series called the vice squad 
or the vice guide and they,

338
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:05,410
they do all kinds of weird shit like to 
go to Africa and they go all over the 

339
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:06,380
world.
North Korea,

340
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:11,030
but the one of the really coolest ones.
We went to this guy who lives by himself

341
00:16:11,031 --> 00:16:16,031
and his wife in a cabin out in the 
middle of nowhere in Alaska.

342
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:21,600
I mean he lives around bears and all he 
does all day is hunt and bring food 

343
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,720
back.
Catch fish and small fish.

344
00:16:23,721 --> 00:16:24,320
Bring it back.

345
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:26,090
Yeah.
I don't know what he does for vegetables

346
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:26,990
cause he's like,
you know,

347
00:16:26,991 --> 00:16:28,040
it's frozen up there.
I mean he's,

348
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:30,230
he's eating fucking Pine Collins.
I don't know what he's eating.

349
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:33,170
I mean I know he gets some supplies 
dropped to him.

350
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:39,420
He never saw nine slash 11.
He hasn't even seen a photo of off the 

351
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:39,420
grid.
These are guides.

352
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:41,210
They're holding off the grid.
There's guys,

353
00:16:41,211 --> 00:16:43,540
they're doing that out there and he's 
just,

354
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:48,610
but he's like so off the grid and he 
says he's extremely happy and he,

355
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:52,130
and he's very articulate.
He's not like a crazy guy.

356
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:57,270
He's a very articulate guy who's been 
doing this for a long time and he says 

357
00:16:57,270 --> 00:16:58,250
that as man gets further away from his 
nature,

358
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,510
like this hunter gatherer nature you,
you,

359
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:03,860
you like lose your connection with the 
earth,

360
00:17:03,861 --> 00:17:08,861
your lose your happiness.
And he thought that that's the reason 

361
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:08,861
why people,
you know,

362
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,430
like so many people are depressed and so
many people hate what they do.

363
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:12,650
Hunter and hunter and gathering like 
this.

364
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:15,830
You're gonna love that.
There's like a visceral response,

365
00:17:15,831 --> 00:17:17,510
like your genes get it.
Yeah.

366
00:17:17,511 --> 00:17:18,890
Yeah.
And it clears your mind.

367
00:17:18,891 --> 00:17:23,891
I mean,
when you're out trying to provide food 

368
00:17:23,891 --> 00:17:23,891
for yourself,
your family,

369
00:17:23,891 --> 00:17:25,050
your friends,
and if that's all you're focused on,

370
00:17:25,051 --> 00:17:27,980
then this,
all this other stuff and doesn't sort of

371
00:17:27,981 --> 00:17:29,440
add up anymore,
you know,

372
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:31,430
it doesn't count.
Doesn't really matter.

373
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:34,670
And so hunting gathering,
I mean that's really where we came from,

374
00:17:34,671 --> 00:17:36,500
but we're a dying breed,
hunting,

375
00:17:36,501 --> 00:17:41,501
gathering people.
So do you think that that's one of the 

376
00:17:41,501 --> 00:17:41,501
reasons why suicide,
I mean it really does make sense,

377
00:17:41,501 --> 00:17:46,091
right?
That that's one of the reasons why 

378
00:17:46,091 --> 00:17:47,321
people in society are so depressed is 
that we are living a life like 

379
00:17:47,321 --> 00:17:50,130
technology and society has gotten far 
past

380
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:54,960
where our genetics,
our genetics still require some acts for

381
00:17:54,961 --> 00:17:56,420
us to feel good.
You know,

382
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:58,450
they have like there's a set in,
you know,

383
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:03,470
a reward system in place for doing 
things like sex feels good so that you 

384
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:07,251
make babies.
Food feels good so that you keep eating 

385
00:18:07,251 --> 00:18:09,791
and your survive.
All these reward systems are set up and 

386
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:11,190
if you take a few of them out without 
correcting the body,

387
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:16,570
like you're going to have like these 
holes are going to have these problems 

388
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:19,930
yet these voids over there and they're 
filled with other things that are 

389
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:24,651
probably not nearly as healthy or good.
I'm not a fascinating idea though that 

390
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:29,900
were like,
it really is like you're looking at 

391
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:29,900
evolution.
I mean you're looking at it,

392
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:32,280
you can tune back into it.
Like if you,

393
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:37,400
if you look at like the way it's set up,
it's set up to make sure that we do 

394
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,930
certain things and if you take these 
certain things away,

395
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:42,540
you,
the body gets fucked up.

396
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:44,300
Like it gets like W,
W we,

397
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:46,290
there's things were missing.
Like people who don't have sex.

398
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:49,380
I've always said this like it doesn't 
matter how religious you are,

399
00:18:49,381 --> 00:18:54,381
if you're not having sex,
you have sexual organs and you're not 

400
00:18:54,381 --> 00:18:57,501
using like do not.
You don't want to experience any 

401
00:18:57,501 --> 00:18:57,501
pleasure.
You don't wanna,

402
00:18:57,501 --> 00:18:59,530
you don't wanna exchange love with 
somebody like that.

403
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:02,160
You're going to break even.
That's not good.

404
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:03,590
That's not good at all.
No.

405
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,360
Sex is good because it was going to 
grow.

406
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:10,400
The natural food is good.
I mean there's all these reward systems 

407
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,160
that are set up.
It's just,

408
00:19:11,161 --> 00:19:16,161
it's really fascinating that so few of 
us are tuned into the hunter gatherer 

409
00:19:16,161 --> 00:19:17,540
thing that you are.
Yeah man.

410
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:19,710
I mean I grew up hunting like breathing 
for me.

411
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:25,090
You know,
it's like it's just part of my life and 

412
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:25,090
I bow hunt and I hunt with shotguns.

413
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:28,770
I hunt with a rifle as I hunt with blow 
guns and spear guns.

414
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:30,510
I just hunt.
I just have to.

415
00:19:30,511 --> 00:19:31,950
And you know,
one of the,

416
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:36,980
one of the Dranamo I think was the great
Indian warrior when he was finally 

417
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:38,520
caught and put on the reservation,
they said to him,

418
00:19:38,521 --> 00:19:40,040
so no drama.
What,

419
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,960
what are you going to do now?
There's no more hunting for you.

420
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:43,920
And he goes,
no,

421
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:48,730
we will hunt mice because we hunters and
we have to hunt and,

422
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:52,710
and that's just sort of,
it's in your blood that needs a hobby.

423
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:56,860
That shit's ridiculous in mice.
How about you play chess on,

424
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,450
settled down,
got to go hunt mice.

425
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,400
What?
Leave the fucking mice alone,

426
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:02,670
man.

427
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:08,840
Not necessarily always the kilo.
It's like the pursuit of something.

428
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:10,870
So do you feel like when you do it,
when you,

429
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,630
when you kill something and then get to 
eat it,

430
00:20:12,631 --> 00:20:13,790
do you feel like,
does,

431
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:19,010
is it triggers some sort of like a 
primitive reward system that you feel 

432
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:19,860
you feel it?
You know,

433
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:25,250
funny enough,
I actually don't like to eat a lot of 

434
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:26,220
what I kill blacks,
which is.

435
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:26,700
Oh,
that's right.

436
00:20:26,701 --> 00:20:28,170
We had this conversation and you're 
like,

437
00:20:28,171 --> 00:20:29,400
beef,
it's what's for dinner.

438
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:34,730
I like beef,
but none of my meat that I've ever 

439
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:34,980
killed goes to waste.
I always give like my,

440
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:39,200
like I don't particularly like deer or 
venison meat because it's so lean,

441
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,650
right?
I like fat.

442
00:20:40,651 --> 00:20:41,790
I like,
I like um,

443
00:20:41,791 --> 00:20:43,770
Ribeye steaks that are just full of 
marbling.

444
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:46,890
So when I,
when I hunt,

445
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,710
I mean I do clean the meat and take care
of it and I was doing it to somebody,

446
00:20:50,711 --> 00:20:52,810
a friend or family or somebody that 
needs it.

447
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,430
But um,
it's,

448
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:58,560
it's really the pursuit and the capture 
of the game that I get the,

449
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:03,820
the reward from the actual taking a bite
of it really.

450
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:05,110
You know what I mean?
It's.

451
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:05,960
See,
I,

452
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:07,570
I get that too.
But I think,

453
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:12,660
I think there's something in deer meat.
I think there's something in deer and 

454
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:13,930
elk and this hear me out.
This sounds totally crazy,

455
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:17,020
but I think the things that are hard to 
catch or better for you,

456
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:20,620
I think that if you've got a cow that's 
just hanging around being a fat fuck and

457
00:21:20,621 --> 00:21:22,060
you walk right up to him and shoot him 
in the head,

458
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:25,570
I don't see how that's good for you.
I mean immediately it is good.

459
00:21:25,571 --> 00:21:28,030
It tastes delicious and everything and I
eat steak like anybody,

460
00:21:28,031 --> 00:21:33,031
but I think it's better to eat deer 
because they're hard to catch when it 

461
00:21:33,031 --> 00:21:33,031
flees.

462
00:21:33,031 --> 00:21:34,050
Be Really,
you know,

463
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:36,490
wouldn't you want to kill fleas?
All data for the same reasoning.

464
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:37,870
Oh my God.
No,

465
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:41,220
because you're not eating.
They're not animals that are praying you

466
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:47,840
hard.
You could squash them.

467
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:50,950
Tired.
I don't think I've ever seen a brian.

468
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:54,030
There's a thing called free split free 
spray fleas.

469
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:57,910
You could fucking kill.
Billions of them was a stroke of a hand.

470
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:59,140
When you're ready to go hunting,
let me know.

471
00:21:59,190 --> 00:21:59,470
Yeah,
we're.

472
00:21:59,471 --> 00:22:00,260
We're going to go.
I,

473
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:03,760
I definitely want to go hunting for 
another podcast when we get back.

474
00:22:03,761 --> 00:22:06,940
When I lived in Colorado,
dear work everywhere.

475
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,810
It was crazy and all these fucking 
liberals and hippies and in boulder,

476
00:22:10,811 --> 00:22:13,420
no one is shooting any of these deer,
so they're so relaxed.

477
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:17,680
They're just standing there big fucking 
10 point bucks just standing on the side

478
00:22:17,681 --> 00:22:19,990
of the road looking at you and I stopped
the car and I'm like,

479
00:22:19,991 --> 00:22:20,520
really?

480
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:23,130
I rolled down the window and I'm talking
to Diego.

481
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:24,700
Really?
Really?

482
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:26,980
He wasn't scared of me at all.
Just looking at me like,

483
00:22:26,981 --> 00:22:27,670
what?
Bitch?

484
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:31,120
That's awesome.
The fucking huge man and they have elk.

485
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:36,240
When we went,
we looked at some property in evergreen 

486
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:36,240
because I was convinced that that was my
move.

487
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,230
I needed to move to the mountains.
That was my.

488
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:41,310
I'm trying to get you in.
Well,

489
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:44,530
let's not talk about that on the 
internet or a fucking psycho stalkers or

490
00:22:44,531 --> 00:22:48,960
listening to pay going Wisconsin.
What's.

491
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,520
Anyway Evergreen.
Oh,

492
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:53,650
when we were looking at property in 
evergreen,

493
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:57,190
there's a herd of elk that wandered.
They had photos.

494
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:02,280
They wandered down a certain path.
They walked through the fucking main 

495
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:05,881
street in town every year and there's 
like hundreds of them in their fucking 

496
00:23:05,881 --> 00:23:10,441
huge.
Like how bad ass is that like you're 

497
00:23:10,441 --> 00:23:10,450
standing there and as you're standing 
there,

498
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:13,690
a herd of elk just walked through the 
fucking town.

499
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,580
It's still not natural though.
I mean really.

500
00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:17,620
I mean where I hunt elk and deer and 
stuff,

501
00:23:17,621 --> 00:23:18,700
man,
they're just wild.

502
00:23:18,701 --> 00:23:22,720
So it's not natural.
It's not natural for not having fear,

503
00:23:22,721 --> 00:23:23,770
man.
Oh yeah,

504
00:23:23,771 --> 00:23:24,630
of course.
It's not natural.

505
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:25,540
It's not enough.
Yeah.

506
00:23:25,541 --> 00:23:30,541
Well the problem is somehow or another,
this town was built on a path that they 

507
00:23:30,541 --> 00:23:31,510
always take the migration thing.
Yeah.

508
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:33,700
So I don't know.
I guess maybe there's also.

509
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:37,030
There's more fear of mountain lions than
there are people,

510
00:23:37,031 --> 00:23:38,110
so they figure,
look,

511
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,730
at least we're around these crazy 
assholes.

512
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:44,850
One of us is getting shot.
We're not all going to get picked apart 

513
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:47,641
by a fucking flock of mountain lions 
because that with mountain lions packs 

514
00:23:47,641 --> 00:23:47,641
packs

515
00:23:47,641 --> 00:23:48,290
even.
They travel solo anyway.

516
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:51,110
No pack wouldn't have.
Maybe they'd be like,

517
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:52,550
oh,
they're spider.

518
00:23:52,551 --> 00:23:54,770
They found in the Amazon you ever seen 
that there's a spider.

519
00:23:54,771 --> 00:23:58,970
They found the Amazon that attacks in 
packs as the only spider in the world.

520
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:04,010
They attacked thousands of them at once,
so they make these gigantic nests.

521
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,030
Huge.
Spiderwebs were like,

522
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:10,520
like a deer could get stuck and when to 
kill much larger things.

523
00:24:10,521 --> 00:24:12,390
They kill rats and all kinds of crazy.
Cool.

524
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:14,270
It's the Amazon did the.
Amazon is.

525
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:19,350
There's A.
There's a BBC documentary about the 

526
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:19,350
Amazon,
a two part series that I watched once.

527
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:20,900
I still have it on vhs.
I can't find it on DVD.

528
00:24:20,901 --> 00:24:24,710
Like they don't have it.
It's fucking phenomenal.

529
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,180
They go into the Amazon.
Yeah,

530
00:24:26,181 --> 00:24:27,850
and that's where they show these 
spiders.

531
00:24:27,851 --> 00:24:32,851
Like there's shit that's evolving in the
Amazon right now with the Amazon was is 

532
00:24:32,851 --> 00:24:35,450
it used to be like fields and then it 
became a rainforest overnight.

533
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,250
Not overnight,
but really quickly.

534
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:42,310
So a lot of animals get stuck inside 
this rain forest and they evolved like 

535
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:44,450
there's an antelope,
it swims,

536
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:49,630
it's got little short legs and it swims 
like up to 100 yards underwater and it 

537
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:53,801
eats fish and it's a fucking antelope.
That's crazy how to do that because it 

538
00:24:53,801 --> 00:24:55,070
gets stuck there and the water and they 
had to figure out another way to eat.

539
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:58,160
There's a fish that fucking climbs out 
of the water,

540
00:24:58,310 --> 00:25:02,180
walks till it finds the next pond and 
jumps in.

541
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:06,800
That's pretty sick too.
Like so much crazy shit there.

542
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:08,960
It's all these animals that are adapting
to this,

543
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:10,010
you know,
just fucked up.

544
00:25:10,011 --> 00:25:12,380
Changing the environment.
Bad Ass.

545
00:25:12,381 --> 00:25:13,840
It's so awesome.
Oh,

546
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:14,960
it'll.
But the spider.

547
00:25:14,961 --> 00:25:16,910
Anyway,
they found one spider.

548
00:25:16,911 --> 00:25:18,560
They've never thought spiders did this 
before,

549
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:23,590
but they found this one spider that acts
as a pack that's sick killer nor 

550
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:29,920
spiderwebs,
and these little fucking mice get stuck 

551
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:32,240
in them and shit and they just swarm on 
foundations of spiders and you're like,

552
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:33,980
fuck.
He's just think what did.

553
00:25:33,981 --> 00:25:35,570
That was me.
What if it's the middle of the night,

554
00:25:35,571 --> 00:25:37,400
I'm going to take a piss and I stuck 
with this

555
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,820
hallucination.
I don't fucking bikers out tracking you.

556
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:44,790
Did you see that photo I posted the 
other day on twitter?

557
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:47,570
That spider my backyard.
I went and met back when it was this,

558
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:50,940
this big identify it.
It looked like the predators face.

559
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:53,700
That's what it looked like.
Where's the picture on my twitter?

560
00:25:53,701 --> 00:25:55,320
Yeah.
Twitter.com/red

561
00:25:55,321 --> 00:25:57,420
band could find health.
How many days ago?

562
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:00,000
Probably like a week ago,
a week ago.

563
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:05,040
I'll retweet or asking too much sun.
You're asking for research?

564
00:26:05,371 --> 00:26:07,830
Read it tonight.
A spider scare the fuck out of me,

565
00:26:07,831 --> 00:26:10,260
man.
I found five scorpions in my living room

566
00:26:10,261 --> 00:26:11,970
once.
Five Scorpions.

567
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,110
Yeah.
There was like a nest.

568
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:14,590
Yeah.
They have scorpions out here.

569
00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:15,220
Really?
Yes.

570
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:16,050
I've seen him many,
many,

571
00:26:16,051 --> 00:26:16,440
many,
many,

572
00:26:16,441 --> 00:26:17,670
many times,
and the little ones,

573
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:19,560
they're very dangerous.
They'll fuck you up,

574
00:26:19,561 --> 00:26:21,210
man.
Trenchless,

575
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:23,100
right?
Rattlesnake was all the time.

576
00:26:23,101 --> 00:26:25,470
Rattle snakes all the time.
We have rattlesnake fencing.

577
00:26:25,530 --> 00:26:27,090
You know my,
my two pit bulls,

578
00:26:27,091 --> 00:26:29,820
both of them had gotten bitten by 
rattlesnakes when I had them.

579
00:26:30,610 --> 00:26:32,940
Fucking rattle snakes are dangerous,
man.

580
00:26:32,941 --> 00:26:33,990
They're all over the place.
Yeah.

581
00:26:33,991 --> 00:26:38,991
When I lived in Calabasas,
I always found snakes all around the 

582
00:26:38,991 --> 00:26:41,931
ground,
just like eaten by other animals like 

583
00:26:41,931 --> 00:26:44,210
coyotes and step on one accidentally.
You gotta be real careful when you're 

584
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:44,210
hiking.
We running.

585
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:48,561
I went running with the dogs and we run.
There's this hill that we run this dirt 

586
00:26:48,561 --> 00:26:50,580
road and when we were running down the 
hill I was like,

587
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,550
oh,
here we are running over this log

588
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:58,160
and as I'm running over the log,
it's a fucking snake.

589
00:26:58,490 --> 00:27:01,250
I realized as my feet were running over 
it,

590
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,200
I was like,
oh my God,

591
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:06,440
he's a rattle snake is fat as my arms 
giant.

592
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:09,260
The biggest rattlesnake I've ever seen.
I was like,

593
00:27:09,261 --> 00:27:12,230
holy fuck.
I mean he was sat dude.

594
00:27:12,231 --> 00:27:14,210
It was fat.
It was like a pitch.

595
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:17,450
It was like,
if that thing got you into like feel the

596
00:27:17,451 --> 00:27:22,451
hot lava,
the fucking venom going into your 

597
00:27:22,451 --> 00:27:25,061
bloodstream immediately that Colt out in
Virginia that actually holds snakes and 

598
00:27:25,641 --> 00:27:27,410
um,
that's part of their religion.

599
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,630
If they don't get bit by the 
rattlesnake,

600
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:31,220
then that means they're like pure and 
stuff.

601
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:37,130
So there was this preacher guy who's in 
prison right now because he wanted to 

602
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:40,781
kill his wife.
So he stuffed her mailbox full of 

603
00:27:40,781 --> 00:27:44,260
rattlesnakes and she opened it up and 
put her hand in and got bit in the jail 

604
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:47,580
for attempted murder.
Damn,

605
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:49,610
that's some fire and brimstone type 
shit.

606
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:51,560
That's type of shit like a preacher 
would think.

607
00:27:51,561 --> 00:27:55,000
Uncle Barry finch it,
fucking snakes.

608
00:27:56,580 --> 00:28:00,930
Tom Story and Shit and a ride he killed 
down by putting a moon.

609
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:08,200
She reached out.
Angela Lansbury somehow

610
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,550
involved with this whole thing.
Just something primal about doing that.

611
00:28:11,551 --> 00:28:13,800
Getting some evil animal.
Do your dirty work.

612
00:28:13,890 --> 00:28:15,970
Sentence somebody up that's.
That's like,

613
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:19,230
that's like way cooler than just 
shooting somebody.

614
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:23,040
You know.
You said fucking rattlesnake Jackson.

615
00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:28,730
When people eat,
it's always fucking husband and his 

616
00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:28,730
wife,
man.

617
00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:31,760
God Damn.
I would like to know about the 

618
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:31,760
percentage of people that kill 
themselves or kill each other.

619
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:36,501
Rather.
What percentage are husband and wife or 

620
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,770
the husband kills the wife or the wife 
killed a husband?

621
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:46,520
Is it more than I like.
What is the percentage as far as like 

622
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:49,251
people getting killed,
like how many of them are husband and 

623
00:28:49,251 --> 00:28:49,251
wife?
How many of them are just,

624
00:28:49,251 --> 00:28:49,830
here's the guy that works at the post 
office that I was fucking pissed me off,

625
00:28:49,831 --> 00:28:54,450
so I shot him and how many of his 
husband and wives I don't understand.

626
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:56,840
I don't think.
I don't think it would be as much as you

627
00:28:56,841 --> 00:28:58,340
think.
I think domestic violence would be huge.

628
00:28:58,370 --> 00:28:59,910
We've seen it goes all the way.
I

629
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:03,370
think we've all.
We've all seen for couples that are just

630
00:29:03,371 --> 00:29:05,540
fucking violent to each other.
Right?

631
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:07,060
Yeah.
That's scary.

632
00:29:07,061 --> 00:29:10,080
Shit.
That must be so scary for a cop.

633
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:15,720
You know?
They always say that those are the most 

634
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:15,720
dangerous calls to take domestic 
violence cases.

635
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:16,750
It doesn't seem so.
Like if you watched the show cops,

636
00:29:16,751 --> 00:29:18,140
it doesn't seem like it's that big of a 
deal to.

637
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:23,530
That was abused by his ex.
I can't go into details,

638
00:29:23,531 --> 00:29:27,130
but she came out with a knife she met 
with a few times.

639
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:30,130
He wasn't fucking her correctly.
No chip.

640
00:29:30,131 --> 00:29:31,840
I'm fucking has ever come at me with a 
knife.

641
00:29:31,930 --> 00:29:33,430
He was.
You've got to keep them in check.

642
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:38,640
Have you got to have control?
Do not get involved in any sort of 

643
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,030
relationship where you.
You're not the man.

644
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:42,040
If you're actually a man.
Don't get involved in

645
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:44,080
a relationship where you're not the man.
If you feel like,

646
00:29:44,081 --> 00:29:47,310
well somehow with her I don't feel like 
I'm the man and just.

647
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:48,850
I don't know what to do.
Get Out,

648
00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:51,310
get out.
You're getting your souls getting stolen

649
00:29:51,311 --> 00:29:54,600
from you in the night while you sleep.
You don't realize everybody's Alpha.

650
00:29:56,650 --> 00:29:59,370
It's not.
It's don't.

651
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:03,010
Then whatever the role is,
make sure it's a harmonious one.

652
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:08,180
You know what I'm saying?
Don't let someone all of a sudden be 

653
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:08,180
like the dominant one.
You figure you're not dominant anymore.

654
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:13,110
Like men who get in situations like that
where their wife gets the yelling and 

655
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:13,110
the fathers,
the husbands always going,

656
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:13,440
okay,
okay,

657
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:14,640
okay,
okay.

658
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:19,520
That's not your name.
It's not healthy there.

659
00:30:19,530 --> 00:30:22,000
There's just,
there's a girl out there somewhere.

660
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:25,570
It's probably nice and if they found 
that girl instead of the one they went,

661
00:30:25,571 --> 00:30:30,571
they found some chick who just likes to 
look at the positive side of things and 

662
00:30:30,571 --> 00:30:33,691
she likes going to cool movies and 
eating and fun places and she doesn't 

663
00:30:33,691 --> 00:30:33,691
require a lot,
you know,

664
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:34,660
that goes out there.

665
00:30:34,810 --> 00:30:37,900
You don't have to listen to this.
Probably dead inside for that.

666
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:39,700
That was very good qualities,
you know,

667
00:30:39,701 --> 00:30:42,270
that's why she's given up on life and 
she's like up.

668
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:48,090
She's enjoying things.
Is that what it is when a chick isn't 

669
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:48,090
crazy,
she's given up on.

670
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:52,060
Maybe it's just interesting.
Sit down and watch like a dead.

671
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:56,290
That's interesting.
So you think that any chick that's like,

672
00:30:56,291 --> 00:30:57,160
no,
I don't really.

673
00:30:57,161 --> 00:31:02,140
I didn't really think this out and just 
throwing something on the table there.

674
00:31:02,770 --> 00:31:04,050
I thought you were committed to this 
man.

675
00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:06,040
You.
You're not committed to this argument.

676
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,390
Rick doesn't even know what we're 
talking about.

677
00:31:09,391 --> 00:31:12,230
I kind of went over my head.
I took.

678
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,350
Rick showed up to his very first UFC 
recently.

679
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,330
I was it.
It was good.

680
00:31:16,331 --> 00:31:21,331
But the balance with you.
I want it to be inside where you guys 

681
00:31:21,331 --> 00:31:22,090
were.
I was like on the outside and I was like

682
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:22,890
too far.

683
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:27,990
I was looking up and I didn't have a 
great view when you guys were on the 

684
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:28,650
floor.
Like a floor seats are not my favorite.

685
00:31:28,651 --> 00:31:32,470
It float my affairs one or two up.
I think you're right.

686
00:31:32,471 --> 00:31:37,471
I think the first risers risers the best
spot because you're still close enough 

687
00:31:37,471 --> 00:31:37,990
to see the action.
You know,

688
00:31:37,991 --> 00:31:39,100
but you're not.
Yeah,

689
00:31:39,101 --> 00:31:40,330
you're not.
You're not looking up.

690
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:43,000
Plus when they go to the ground on the 
other side of the cage,

691
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:47,280
if you're on the HD,
because I bought all the time on paper.

692
00:31:47,290 --> 00:31:49,750
You like,
I get like the close ups.

693
00:31:49,751 --> 00:31:53,660
I hear the sounds more.
I was more in the fight commentary here.

694
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:55,900
Yeah,
I didn't hear any commentary.

695
00:31:56,230 --> 00:32:01,230
You can get these little.
They have these little radio things and 

696
00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:01,300
you uh,
they sell them a UFC fight link,

697
00:32:01,301 --> 00:32:06,301
I believe it's called.
And you listened to it and you get to 

698
00:32:06,301 --> 00:32:06,301
listen to the commentary.

699
00:32:06,301 --> 00:32:06,301
They broadcast it.
Unlike a wireless signal,

700
00:32:06,301 --> 00:32:08,020
like a radio station on iphone APP for 
that.

701
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,790
They should totally right.
Totally.

702
00:32:09,850 --> 00:32:10,840
Totally.
What the fuck,

703
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:12,970
Dana?
Dana gunders shit son.

704
00:32:13,690 --> 00:32:14,560
It was cool though,
man.

705
00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:17,710
We use a huge UFC fan.
Just wrote a movie about it.

706
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:20,050
So we'll see what happens.
But yeah,

707
00:32:20,051 --> 00:32:21,980
I mean Rick Schroeder,
chuck,

708
00:32:22,050 --> 00:32:23,910
Chuck Norris Talk to me.
Well,

709
00:32:23,911 --> 00:32:25,950
it's like 15 years ago Chuck Norris 
hugged me.

710
00:32:25,951 --> 00:32:28,570
He's the greatest moment of my life.
She was like,

711
00:32:28,810 --> 00:32:31,390
did he try to start some MMA league?
Well,

712
00:32:31,391 --> 00:32:32,860
he did it.
He had a kickboxing league,

713
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,380
I think it was called the world combat 
league.

714
00:32:35,381 --> 00:32:37,460
I'm not sure.
I'm not sure if that's the right name.

715
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:40,160
Fifteen years,
apologize from because I'm a huge

716
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:45,160
chuck Norris Fan and when he tried to 
get me in on that way back in the 

717
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:47,450
beginning like let's build a team in La.
That's exactly what he was doing.

718
00:32:47,451 --> 00:32:50,810
He was doing kickboxing teams and they 
tried to do that with the IFL.

719
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:53,510
IFL is the international fight league 
and had some really good fighters,

720
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:55,100
but they tried to do that team thing 
too.

721
00:32:55,101 --> 00:32:56,540
They had tried to have them fighting 
teams.

722
00:32:56,930 --> 00:32:59,390
The only thing would be fun is if 
they're all at once.

723
00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:00,030
Well,
you know,

724
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:01,540
I thought it was.
I thought,

725
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:02,330
you know,
hey look,

726
00:33:02,331 --> 00:33:03,860
you know,
say it's not the right way to go,

727
00:33:03,861 --> 00:33:08,861
but at least it's something different 
and people are talking about it like it 

728
00:33:08,861 --> 00:33:08,861
makes for a subject of debate.
Do you like this?

729
00:33:08,861 --> 00:33:09,730
You're not like this,
you know,

730
00:33:09,810 --> 00:33:11,930
it makes it a little novel.
But yeah,

731
00:33:11,931 --> 00:33:13,370
it's not the way to do it.

732
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:15,210
Teams aren't the way to do it.
I would,

733
00:33:15,290 --> 00:33:15,800
I,
I,

734
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:17,600
you know,
when all those things were coming around

735
00:33:17,601 --> 00:33:22,601
I was like,
what are you doing an individual sport 

736
00:33:22,601 --> 00:33:22,940
team?
Guess what they're doing is they're just

737
00:33:22,941 --> 00:33:26,390
trying to get in on some unique way,
you know,

738
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:27,740
like everybody else is doing it this 
way.

739
00:33:27,741 --> 00:33:32,741
So we're gonna have teams,
the Denver douchebags and the fucking 

740
00:33:32,741 --> 00:33:33,010
the Montreal monsters,
you know,

741
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:38,560
folding chairs and do it.
Let's say it seemed very roller derby.

742
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:44,330
I was going to say that you went pro 
wrestling on the same wavelength there.

743
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:46,490
It's a,
I don't know man.

744
00:33:47,130 --> 00:33:48,230
It's,
it's interesting.

745
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:52,040
The only way to do is just do it.
Just have to stop trying to dress it up.

746
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:54,680
I,
I do like some strikeforce rules.

747
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:57,050
Strikeforce has put rules in when they 
don't have elbows.

748
00:33:57,290 --> 00:33:58,880
I don't know,
like a lot of people like elbows.

749
00:33:59,010 --> 00:34:04,010
Fuck elbows cut people up man.
And I know you should just protect 

750
00:34:04,010 --> 00:34:04,100
yourself from that.
And you know,

751
00:34:04,101 --> 00:34:09,101
and elbows can stop fights too.
They're very dangerous weapons but I 

752
00:34:09,101 --> 00:34:09,740
kinda like strikeforce held,
just use punches.

753
00:34:09,741 --> 00:34:11,060
They don't elbow each other on the 
ground.

754
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:13,370
I think it does.
I think it make,

755
00:34:13,610 --> 00:34:18,610
it might make fighters' careers longer.
I mean people like it though and it's a 

756
00:34:18,610 --> 00:34:22,451
very effective technique.
Maybe they need some sort of a pat on 

757
00:34:22,451 --> 00:34:22,490
the elbow if that's possible,
you know,

758
00:34:22,491 --> 00:34:27,491
that might not be a bad idea.
That doesn't cut it because it's such a 

759
00:34:27,491 --> 00:34:30,461
short movement when you're on top of a 
gun and shoot your fucking short 

760
00:34:30,461 --> 00:34:33,590
distance to stop and so much power you 
can generate and it's just bone on bone.

761
00:34:33,591 --> 00:34:35,930
Just smashing your fucking face and 
that's a.

762
00:34:35,931 --> 00:34:38,210
that's a God damn dangerous technique 
man.

763
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:38,910
Make it happen.

764
00:34:38,930 --> 00:34:41,180
Like a sound like a dog toy though.
Every time they do it,

765
00:34:41,181 --> 00:34:46,181
it's like a squishy toys.
Don't think there's any.

766
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:50,600
I don't think there's anything wrong 
with elbows.

767
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:51,440
I mean,
don't get me wrong,

768
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:55,730
I wouldn't take them out either,
but I looked at the strikeforce rule and

769
00:34:55,731 --> 00:34:56,810
I go,
maybe that's the way to go.

770
00:34:56,811 --> 00:34:58,490
Sometimes.
Sometimes I'll look at it and go,

771
00:34:58,491 --> 00:34:59,640
I like that.
That's around.

772
00:34:59,690 --> 00:35:01,220
I liked,
you know what I do like,

773
00:35:01,221 --> 00:35:03,510
I like that there's a comparison.
We can look at the strike force,

774
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:05,000
see,
see what happens with them.

775
00:35:05,001 --> 00:35:07,130
With the punches on the ground,
like we've already done that with pride.

776
00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:10,280
The old pride days,
they used to be able to do whatever they

777
00:35:10,281 --> 00:35:10,850
wanted.
Man,

778
00:35:10,851 --> 00:35:12,680
they could.
Soccer kick dudes while their heads were

779
00:35:12,681 --> 00:35:17,681
on the ground and stomp on them,
they don't think they allowed headbutts 

780
00:35:17,681 --> 00:35:19,100
and they don't think they allow growing,
growing kicks.

781
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:24,100
I don't.
I don't think the allowed fish hooking 

782
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:24,100
or any of this stuff that's always 
illegal.

783
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:25,940
They didn't allow it,
but they added the stomps and the soccer

784
00:35:25,941 --> 00:35:30,941
kicks and the knees to the head to a 
downed opponent and it's all really 

785
00:35:30,941 --> 00:35:31,280
fucking violent,
dangerous shit.

786
00:35:31,281 --> 00:35:33,650
You know when you see a guy get soccer 
kicked in the head,

787
00:35:33,651 --> 00:35:34,520
that's when you know,
you're like,

788
00:35:34,521 --> 00:35:36,170
whoa,
like shit,

789
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:39,090
this is,
this is not fucking playing around.

790
00:35:39,091 --> 00:35:44,091
This is a real fight.
Like that guy just soccer kicked that 

791
00:35:44,091 --> 00:35:45,690
guy in the face when he's down.
It's not the best thing to have an MMA,

792
00:35:45,691 --> 00:35:47,820
but pocket adds this crazy element to 
it.

793
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:50,580
You know when a guy goes down,
the other guys trying to stomp them,

794
00:35:50,610 --> 00:35:52,710
like literally like,
whoa.

795
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:55,460
Vandelay silva knocked out.
I think it was tomorrow.

796
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:56,580
No,
it wasn't Tamora.

797
00:35:56,910 --> 00:35:57,840
Damn.
I forgot who it was.

798
00:35:57,870 --> 00:35:58,980
Yuki Kondo.
Yes,

799
00:35:58,981 --> 00:36:03,981
I believe it was.
He knocked him out and then he started 

800
00:36:03,981 --> 00:36:04,230
stomping his fucking head while he was 
down,

801
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:07,200
but then early UFC is like biting and 
stuff.

802
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,880
Maybe it wasn't usually condo.
I should.

803
00:36:08,910 --> 00:36:11,520
I should find out exactly who it was 
with vandelay do that before I said it,

804
00:36:11,521 --> 00:36:16,521
but whoever it was,
he was holding onto the ropes with one 

805
00:36:16,521 --> 00:36:17,610
hand than kicking the guy in the face 
stomping on his head while he was down.

806
00:36:17,611 --> 00:36:19,710
It was so violent.
I was like,

807
00:36:19,711 --> 00:36:21,630
fuck.
Like that.

808
00:36:21,631 --> 00:36:23,850
Took it to another level.
That's the rep's fault though.

809
00:36:23,851 --> 00:36:25,680
For now it's illegal.
It's illegal.

810
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:29,370
In Japan it's legal will pan and pride.
It was legal.

811
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:34,640
I think you can still do it.
I know you can definitely still kick or 

812
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:34,710
nea down.
Deponent,

813
00:36:34,770 --> 00:36:39,770
I think you could soccer kick him still 
to and you can stomp them still to I 

814
00:36:39,770 --> 00:36:39,770
think.

815
00:36:39,770 --> 00:36:40,350
I think dream the way they do.
I mean there's.

816
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:45,380
There's different organizations,
like one of the things that the UFC has 

817
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:45,380
always been pushing for is a unified 
system of rules.

818
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:49,941
So the rules we use,
everybody uses so that we all practice 

819
00:36:49,941 --> 00:36:50,850
the same sport.
That makes complete sense.

820
00:36:50,851 --> 00:36:53,070
Totally complete sense.
It's totally the right way to go.

821
00:36:53,310 --> 00:36:57,390
But Japan was either fuck don't like 
five minute,

822
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:02,280
10 minute round and they have crazy shit
with her coming in and they'll take your

823
00:37:02,281 --> 00:37:04,020
money away if they don't think you're 
fighting hard enough.

824
00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:05,170
Really?
Yeah Dude,

825
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:09,720
they get crazy laws over there.
So like say if a and sometimes man dudes

826
00:37:09,721 --> 00:37:12,240
are just taking a fucking breather,
like it's a war,

827
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:14,310
you know?
Or they neutralize each other.

828
00:37:14,311 --> 00:37:15,840
They can't,
nobody can get anything done.

829
00:37:15,990 --> 00:37:17,130
And I go stop,
stop.

830
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:18,510
And they pull out a yellow card.

831
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:21,960
And what a yellow card is is they take 
10 percent of your fucking purse.

832
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:25,800
So if you're getting paid 100 grand,
you just lost $10,000

833
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:29,790
because some fucking douchebag referee 
decided you needed a yellow card because

834
00:37:29,791 --> 00:37:34,791
you're not fighting hard enough.
At least it's just that in Japan a 

835
00:37:34,791 --> 00:37:37,311
yellow card can mean a lot of things.
It could be get the use and the women 

836
00:37:37,311 --> 00:37:40,920
that cut your finger off,
it could mean that's a p card.

837
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:45,950
That's the craziest thing ever.
The Yakuza where they chopped his 

838
00:37:45,950 --> 00:37:45,950
fingers off,
fuck up.

839
00:37:45,950 --> 00:37:47,550
You do something wrong.
You have to cut your finger off.

840
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:50,400
That's your.
That's your punishment.

841
00:37:50,450 --> 00:37:51,270
Yeah.
Yeah.

842
00:37:51,330 --> 00:37:53,910
That's one of the pumps because you hear
about the Saudis trying to paralyze some

843
00:37:53,911 --> 00:37:55,680
guy.
Did they go through with it?

844
00:37:55,681 --> 00:38:00,681
You know,
I don't know if they've gone through 

845
00:38:00,681 --> 00:38:01,941
with it.
I know they're inquiring on whether or 

846
00:38:01,941 --> 00:38:01,941
not it can be done.

847
00:38:01,941 --> 00:38:01,941
One hospital said they wouldn't be 
doing.

848
00:38:01,941 --> 00:38:02,100
If you don't know the story,
there's a.

849
00:38:02,110 --> 00:38:05,060
A guy hit a guy with a shovel,
so when he hit him with,

850
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:10,080
I don't know any details,
he assaulted this guy in some way and 

851
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,740
and paralyzed him and under Islamic law 
and you know,

852
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:16,760
I foreign high.
They literally want to impose the exact 

853
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:18,030
same injury to this guy and do it in a 
hospital.

854
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:20,970
One hospital.
It's like you can't paralyze somebody.

855
00:38:20,971 --> 00:38:23,460
Like we can't just do that in another 
hospital said it was possible,

856
00:38:23,461 --> 00:38:26,100
but they did not have the conditions 
available.

857
00:38:26,101 --> 00:38:27,810
They would have to go to a much larger 
hospital,

858
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:32,960
so they probably went to some fucking 
goat and donkey infested the hospital 

859
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:33,450
with chickens running through the 
fucking bobby.

860
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:38,740
He's like,
would you be willing to paralyze 

861
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:38,740
someone?
And they're like,

862
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:39,730
well maybe we can do it here though.

863
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:41,720
There's a guy in south central,
they'll do it for $100.

864
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:43,720
Would you guys.
Do you guys agree with that though?

865
00:38:43,721 --> 00:38:46,060
Eye for an eye judgments,
man.

866
00:38:46,061 --> 00:38:47,950
You know what?
I think there's just a certain amount of

867
00:38:47,951 --> 00:38:49,930
cruelty to that.
It's not necessary.

868
00:38:49,931 --> 00:38:53,290
I think if you want to show people that 
it's wrong,

869
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,760
killed a guy.
That's what I think.

870
00:38:54,761 --> 00:38:57,210
I say death penalty is a good thing,
but you know what I mean?

871
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:58,780
You have to know the circumstances.
Who knows?

872
00:38:58,781 --> 00:39:03,781
Maybe the other guy is a dickhead.
Maybe the other guy threw a rock first 

873
00:39:03,781 --> 00:39:03,781
and then he hit him with a shovel and 
paralyzed him.

874
00:39:03,781 --> 00:39:08,340
We don't have enough information.
Maybe that guy was fucking tormenting 

875
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:08,340
him and he wouldn't leave his kids 
alone.

876
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:09,880
It was an asshole kicked his dog and you
know,

877
00:39:09,881 --> 00:39:14,881
it was building up over 10 fucking years
and finally homeboy had enough and he 

878
00:39:14,881 --> 00:39:15,370
just did what he supposed to have done a
long time ago.

879
00:39:15,490 --> 00:39:17,470
Crack that motherfucker over the head 
with a shovel.

880
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:22,740
But unfortunately his little faggot ass 
has to go and get paralyzed and now my 

881
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:25,280
mans in the pokey and they're talking 
about paralyzing him too.

882
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:28,120
Meanwhile all he was dealing with just 
trying to hold his ground,

883
00:39:28,121 --> 00:39:30,190
just trying to get by in this world,
you know,

884
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,450
just trying to.
They should have the three strike rule.

885
00:39:32,451 --> 00:39:33,940
Like the first time you do something 
really,

886
00:39:33,941 --> 00:39:34,870
really bad,
they cut it.

887
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:37,360
They take away your hearing.
Then the second time they take away your

888
00:39:37,361 --> 00:39:39,640
eyesight.
Third time to chop off your tongue.

889
00:39:39,641 --> 00:39:41,860
Dude,
you might've just invented that.

890
00:39:41,861 --> 00:39:43,860
And there's people in Iran right now,
right?

891
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:47,880
I did.
Before the ideas,

892
00:39:49,050 --> 00:39:54,050
get that back,
come up solutions.

893
00:39:56,550 --> 00:39:58,170
It's hilarious.
It's cheaper.

894
00:39:58,220 --> 00:40:01,380
Codeine goes,
I have a car account.

895
00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:02,490
Their retail,
me not,

896
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:07,760
dude,
I don't know what action we were there 

897
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:07,760
at the end.
We went Japanese and we started off.

898
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,940
We have the worst fake Iranian accent 
ever.

899
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:12,410
I'm an insult to any impersonator out 
there.

900
00:40:15,410 --> 00:40:16,980
Joe,
what can I tell you,

901
00:40:16,981 --> 00:40:17,990
man?
Without telling me.

902
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,260
What do you want to know about back in 
the day?

903
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:20,400
Dude,
what I want to know.

904
00:40:20,401 --> 00:40:21,390
Everything we know.
I've,

905
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:24,440
I've been friends with rick for a few 
years.

906
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:27,780
Four or five years.
Gotten more friendly lately since he got

907
00:40:27,781 --> 00:40:29,760
back from Spain?
Yes,

908
00:40:30,050 --> 00:40:30,800
please.
Yeah,

909
00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:33,750
just really changed and I became a 
pussy.

910
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:34,710
Okay.
Hold on.

911
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,250
Like all the other posts out there in 
the world?

912
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:38,550
No,
I'm,

913
00:40:38,551 --> 00:40:39,120
I'm,
you know,

914
00:40:39,121 --> 00:40:44,121
for sure.
I don't think you can understand what 

915
00:40:44,121 --> 00:40:44,121
it's like to have children until you 
have children and you know,

916
00:40:44,121 --> 00:40:46,500
Louis Ck said something once about kids 
I thought was really interesting.

917
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:48,330
He said just let it change you.

918
00:40:48,870 --> 00:40:51,690
And uh,
I had already like kind of let it change

919
00:40:51,691 --> 00:40:52,950
me before I heard that.
But I was like,

920
00:40:52,951 --> 00:40:54,780
wow,
that's like the best way to describe it.

921
00:40:55,110 --> 00:40:56,520
Let it change you,
you know?

922
00:40:56,521 --> 00:40:57,820
And when you have kids,
that's.

923
00:40:57,930 --> 00:40:59,850
That really is what happens like you,
you,

924
00:40:59,851 --> 00:41:01,560
all of a sudden,
first of all,

925
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:05,400
the immediately when I started doing is 
looking at people as babies.

926
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:10,760
I looked at everybody.
I used to just see a guy who's 30 and I 

927
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:10,760
was like,
Oh,

928
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:10,760
here's a guy.
Hey Buddy,

929
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:11,730
what's up?
Nothing.

930
00:41:11,790 --> 00:41:12,480
You know,
normal.

931
00:41:12,481 --> 00:41:17,481
But now you said like the inner child it
now I didn't see the inner child to see 

932
00:41:17,481 --> 00:41:20,931
how he developed to be that guy.
You have much more compassion for 

933
00:41:20,931 --> 00:41:20,931
people,
you know.

934
00:41:20,931 --> 00:41:21,510
That's cool.
I try to.

935
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:26,600
I try to keep as much compassion as 
possible while still avoiding Douche 

936
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:27,420
bags.
That's my ethic.

937
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:29,610
But there's a certain point in time 
where sometimes you have to go,

938
00:41:29,611 --> 00:41:30,810
dude,
shut the fuck up.

939
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:33,620
Please leave me alone.
I know you were a baby once.

940
00:41:34,790 --> 00:41:39,790
No one point in time you were an 
innocent little child and somebody 

941
00:41:39,790 --> 00:41:40,010
fucked your programming up.
I understand this.

942
00:41:40,450 --> 00:41:41,930
You got to let me go.
I got shit.

943
00:41:41,931 --> 00:41:44,110
I gotta do you know it's right,
right.

944
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:45,320
I get it.
But yeah,

945
00:41:45,321 --> 00:41:47,570
you have changed at time.
So I think everybody does.

946
00:41:47,930 --> 00:41:49,700
If you don't change when you have kids,
you were full,

947
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:54,880
you'd be crazy to you.
The worst thing in the world that you 

948
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,000
could ever feel is that you didn't do 
your best when you were raising a kid.

949
00:41:56,150 --> 00:42:01,150
That's got to be the worst thing because
I think your childhood was fucking 

950
00:42:01,150 --> 00:42:01,970
completely bizarre.
I mean,

951
00:42:01,971 --> 00:42:06,971
my childhood was bizarre on paper,
but it wasn't bizarre in front of the 

952
00:42:06,971 --> 00:42:08,190
whole world,
you know?

953
00:42:08,210 --> 00:42:11,960
And you became a fucking superstar when 
you were a little kid.

954
00:42:12,110 --> 00:42:13,110
You're 40 now,
right?

955
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:14,270
Just.
Okay.

956
00:42:14,271 --> 00:42:17,240
I'm 43.
So when I saw the champ,

957
00:42:17,241 --> 00:42:18,320
I think I was seven.

958
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:19,480
What were you like for?
No,

959
00:42:19,481 --> 00:42:20,660
no,
I was seven.

960
00:42:20,750 --> 00:42:23,270
So you were 10 and the champ.
Really?

961
00:42:23,850 --> 00:42:24,460
Okay.
My,

962
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:25,460
my,
my time rotten.

963
00:42:26,470 --> 00:42:27,320
Either way.
Either way,

964
00:42:27,350 --> 00:42:31,550
whatever I was seven or 10.
I was fucking crying like a baby.

965
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:35,600
And you were even younger than me then.
So when I was a little kid,

966
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:38,540
when I was like going through life,
trying to figure out,

967
00:42:38,541 --> 00:42:39,830
you know,
what my parents were breaking,

968
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:41,480
I'm going to try and figure out like,
fuck,

969
00:42:41,481 --> 00:42:46,481
what is life all about?
You were fucking famous in front of the 

970
00:42:46,610 --> 00:42:49,280
world,
like I couldn't imagine that point in my

971
00:42:49,281 --> 00:42:54,281
life being famous.
That must've been so strange to develop 

972
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:56,450
in that.
But you're so normal.

973
00:42:56,540 --> 00:43:01,540
Well,
here's the thing that's I think 

974
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:02,740
interesting about like growing up famous
because I became famous when I was 

975
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:06,740
seven,
so I don't have any memory of life 

976
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:06,740
before fame.

977
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:10,120
Wow.
So when that happens and you're forming 

978
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:11,600
and you're getting programmed and you're
getting created as a child,

979
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:14,270
right?
That's where it becomes normal for you.

980
00:43:14,630 --> 00:43:19,630
And so I don't have any frame of 
reference like I wasn't 30 and all of a 

981
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:23,540
sudden Bam became famous and I had 30 
years of history of normal life.

982
00:43:23,870 --> 00:43:28,040
So fame is normal for me.
So because it's normal,

983
00:43:28,190 --> 00:43:33,190
that means kind of.
It's not special because what's normal 

984
00:43:33,190 --> 00:43:33,680
is normal.
Right.

985
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:39,340
So that's kind of,
I think at different unique thing about 

986
00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:39,340
being a child actor.
Like I wasn't.

987
00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:43,930
I started bag barrymore last night.
I went to never heard anybody put it 

988
00:43:43,930 --> 00:43:43,930
that way before I went to her premier 
last night and she,

989
00:43:43,930 --> 00:43:47,360
she's kind of done the same thing and 
her new movie and uh,

990
00:43:47,390 --> 00:43:49,720
gave her a big hug and kiss.
I haven't seen her in 20 years.

991
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:52,400
Do you grab her ass and not just cheat 
girl though?

992
00:43:52,430 --> 00:43:54,580
Get rid.
Get rid of a case.

993
00:43:54,620 --> 00:43:57,620
I've known her since I felt good.
I felt good.

994
00:43:57,621 --> 00:44:00,800
She was eight as drew barrymore dance.
I'm Tom Green.

995
00:44:00,801 --> 00:44:02,720
That God that you could get that poor 
kid.

996
00:44:03,710 --> 00:44:06,500
She picks the weirdest guys.
It's great.

997
00:44:06,501 --> 00:44:07,900
I love Tom Green.
Yeah,

998
00:44:07,910 --> 00:44:08,870
I'll do his show.
No,

999
00:44:08,871 --> 00:44:13,871
I didn't.
He doesn't show like Canadian far more 

1000
00:44:13,871 --> 00:44:13,871
sophisticated.
Yeah,

1001
00:44:13,871 --> 00:44:13,871
he's Canadian,
but you can trust him.

1002
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:19,100
I trust him.
He's one of the good news to see the 

1003
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:20,390
show where he took animals into his 
parents house at a zoo.

1004
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:21,980
He fucked a moose on the side of the 
road.

1005
00:44:21,981 --> 00:44:23,050
He's a savage.
Yeah.

1006
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:24,380
He's.
He's fucking awesome.

1007
00:44:24,381 --> 00:44:26,380
I love that dude.
He's a really cool guy too.

1008
00:44:26,381 --> 00:44:27,320
His.
He's got a,

1009
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:29,360
like a show that he's been doing out of 
his house.

1010
00:44:29,630 --> 00:44:31,970
He turned his living room into a studio 
where

1011
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:36,480
he like broadcast a live talk show from 
his living room and it's super popular.

1012
00:44:36,481 --> 00:44:37,980
It's really good.
It's interesting.

1013
00:44:37,981 --> 00:44:41,640
You get to see him changing and trying 
different things.

1014
00:44:41,990 --> 00:44:44,600
When I got to him,
he was into the secret who's like,

1015
00:44:44,620 --> 00:44:49,620
really?
He's like head of a copy of it right 

1016
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:49,620
there.
I mean,

1017
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:49,650
I don't even know if he was telling the 
truth.

1018
00:44:49,651 --> 00:44:51,480
I believe he was,
but it seemed like almost it was like,

1019
00:44:51,481 --> 00:44:54,880
it was like it was trolling you was just
fucking around pretending to be into the

1020
00:44:54,881 --> 00:44:57,140
secret thing.
But um,

1021
00:44:57,240 --> 00:45:02,240
so drew the same thing.
It's been a few of us that have gone 

1022
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:02,510
through that,
like not many very,

1023
00:45:02,590 --> 00:45:07,590
very few.
I could count on a hand the percentage 

1024
00:45:07,590 --> 00:45:08,800
of people who go through that and get 
Lindsay Lohan or like,

1025
00:45:08,850 --> 00:45:10,170
it's like 95.
Right.

1026
00:45:10,570 --> 00:45:15,570
More more than it's gotta be.
What do you think was the difference 

1027
00:45:15,570 --> 00:45:16,740
with you or what's the difference?

1028
00:45:16,770 --> 00:45:21,770
You know,
I quit the partying thing when I was 

1029
00:45:21,770 --> 00:45:24,290
young and I didn't continue it.
Like I think some people do and you 

1030
00:45:24,661 --> 00:45:27,720
know,
I had my few wildly years between 16 and

1031
00:45:28,170 --> 00:45:30,060
20,
but you know,

1032
00:45:30,330 --> 00:45:35,330
I always kept my kind of stuff quiet and
I kind of kept it under the radar and it

1033
00:45:35,610 --> 00:45:38,170
wasn't really public about it.
And then I met [inaudible].

1034
00:45:38,250 --> 00:45:40,170
There was no TMZ,
there's no internet,

1035
00:45:41,370 --> 00:45:46,370
no one in the sun.
And keep it on the dl here making it 

1036
00:45:46,370 --> 00:45:47,980
rain.
Do you ever wonder,

1037
00:45:47,981 --> 00:45:52,981
like when I was 20 I met Andrea and that
just kind of changed my life because I 

1038
00:45:52,981 --> 00:45:52,981
was,
I was a data at 22.

1039
00:45:52,981 --> 00:45:53,940
Oh.
So that's a big part of it.

1040
00:45:53,941 --> 00:45:55,080
Too.
Responsibility.

1041
00:45:55,081 --> 00:46:00,081
Very early on.
How did you used to hang out with all 

1042
00:46:00,081 --> 00:46:00,390
those people back in the data?
Like Gary Coleman and all those guys.

1043
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:02,940
Like I like where you're like hanging 
with punky brewster and stuff.

1044
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:04,770
Yeah,
I knew everybody there.

1045
00:46:04,771 --> 00:46:07,500
I mean the different strokes kids.
We're filming next door.

1046
00:46:07,501 --> 00:46:12,501
The facts of life.
Girls were across the other studio 

1047
00:46:12,501 --> 00:46:12,501
stage.
Did you guys met each other?

1048
00:46:12,501 --> 00:46:13,500
Who's the boss?
Kids.

1049
00:46:13,590 --> 00:46:15,150
Did you guys into?
You must've,

1050
00:46:15,151 --> 00:46:15,490
right?
Yeah.

1051
00:46:16,550 --> 00:46:19,810
Yeah.
It's small wonder ustream.

1052
00:46:20,580 --> 00:46:23,550
USTREAM crowd knows what's up,
so yeah,

1053
00:46:23,551 --> 00:46:25,560
there was some drama going on on,
on set.

1054
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:26,520
You know what I mean?
There was.

1055
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:30,400
I told you a little bit about the top 
bridges todd bridges I had.

1056
00:46:30,530 --> 00:46:33,450
We had todd bridges on fear factor and 
he had a chip on his shoulder.

1057
00:46:33,451 --> 00:46:33,990
I mean,
not,

1058
00:46:33,991 --> 00:46:35,700
not.
I mean it wasn't a bad guy,

1059
00:46:35,701 --> 00:46:39,490
but had this thought that everybody was 
out to fuck them.

1060
00:46:39,820 --> 00:46:44,820
Everybody,
like we were fucking them over like we 

1061
00:46:44,820 --> 00:46:44,820
didn't want them to win.
Oh,

1062
00:46:44,820 --> 00:46:44,820
I see.

1063
00:46:44,820 --> 00:46:44,820
What's up.
You don't want me to when I was like to,

1064
00:46:44,820 --> 00:46:47,290
but the guy or the guy beat yet.
What am I going to say?

1065
00:46:48,050 --> 00:46:49,400
Come on man.
It's ridiculous.

1066
00:46:49,420 --> 00:46:52,260
But he's got a new book out,
so like God bless him.

1067
00:46:52,261 --> 00:46:53,680
I hope he sells it and stuff,
but.

1068
00:46:53,681 --> 00:46:54,760
Well he just,
you know,

1069
00:46:54,930 --> 00:46:59,930
he didn't.
My point is he did not get through it 

1070
00:46:59,930 --> 00:47:02,571
the way you got through.
He was chasing me around with a pistol 

1071
00:47:02,571 --> 00:47:02,571
full of urine.
Wow.

1072
00:47:02,571 --> 00:47:03,630
Water pistol.
He was,

1073
00:47:04,430 --> 00:47:05,040
he was.
Yeah.

1074
00:47:05,041 --> 00:47:10,041
I mean,
he was pissing a water pistol and then 

1075
00:47:10,041 --> 00:47:10,041
just say,
okay,

1076
00:47:10,041 --> 00:47:12,450
I'm going to score it.
The rest of us will be thrown water cups

1077
00:47:12,451 --> 00:47:17,451
at each other and crap,
and he took it to the next level and 

1078
00:47:17,451 --> 00:47:19,350
just started squirting it was urine.
Ran Him over with your training.

1079
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:21,570
He was big and he was older.

1080
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:24,090
We were all scared of todd.
How old was he?

1081
00:47:24,210 --> 00:47:27,390
And we were all like 13,
14 and he's all like 18.

1082
00:47:27,391 --> 00:47:28,850
19.
Oh my God.

1083
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:31,960
He was 18 and 19.
He was pissing in little kids faces.

1084
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:35,680
Yeah.
Kelly was the originator of that.

1085
00:47:35,740 --> 00:47:36,730
He had a porsche.
Right.

1086
00:47:36,731 --> 00:47:40,090
And so he was racing around the studio 
and stuff and I remember I was 16.

1087
00:47:40,180 --> 00:47:42,820
I had just gotten my nine,
44 turbo and he's like,

1088
00:47:42,821 --> 00:47:44,170
let me take it for a drive.
And I'm like,

1089
00:47:44,290 --> 00:47:45,670
oh,
okay.

1090
00:47:46,050 --> 00:47:48,880
So I gave him the car keys and he's 
like,

1091
00:47:48,881 --> 00:47:52,930
this thing is broken and right.
He just abused my car.

1092
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:55,750
He brought it back with bald spots on 
the time.

1093
00:47:55,940 --> 00:47:57,550
Wow.
Wow.

1094
00:47:57,890 --> 00:48:01,040
And you let them do that to todd 
bridges?

1095
00:48:01,810 --> 00:48:02,290
Yeah.
Well,

1096
00:48:02,291 --> 00:48:04,090
todd bridges,
he wasn't a bad dude though.

1097
00:48:04,270 --> 00:48:06,250
He's just so.
He's just a fucking baby.

1098
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:10,430
That got stuck into a weird situation.
They just didn't develop that.

1099
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:11,440
Right.
Dana?

1100
00:48:11,441 --> 00:48:12,820
Plato became a drug addict,
right?

1101
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:14,350
Yeah,
she died in Vegas.

1102
00:48:15,730 --> 00:48:20,730
That's the place to die.
You're gonna die with other drug 

1103
00:48:20,730 --> 00:48:20,730
addicts.
The disease.

1104
00:48:20,730 --> 00:48:22,300
Segal finds its flock.
Can I place it?

1105
00:48:22,301 --> 00:48:23,640
This quote that I was talking about 
earlier?

1106
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:25,560
Oh yeah.
This is silver spoons.

1107
00:48:25,570 --> 00:48:26,170
Yeah,
it was from.

1108
00:48:26,230 --> 00:48:27,460
I love.
I love silver spoons,

1109
00:48:27,461 --> 00:48:32,461
but this is one of my favorite quotes 
and it's so weird to listen to right 

1110
00:48:32,461 --> 00:48:32,461
now.
Listen,

1111
00:48:32,461 --> 00:48:32,461
listen,
listen to this.

1112
00:48:32,461 --> 00:48:35,140
That's fine.
What's like the recording?

1113
00:48:35,930 --> 00:48:36,670
This is crazy.

1114
00:48:37,670 --> 00:48:42,670
See computers,
a teacher someday.

1115
00:48:43,111 --> 00:48:48,111
People that do their computers are 
shopping Sunday almost every computer.

1116
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:57,140
We need special stories that books with 
the state.

1117
00:48:58,300 --> 00:49:01,290
That was Arnold Jackson trying to talk.
Steal money lets me and Gary Coleman.

1118
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:06,600
So listen to what you were saying man.
You were saying that like was it 1983 or

1119
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:11,860
82?
What'd you do?

1120
00:49:12,180 --> 00:49:12,770
What'd you do?
Man?

1121
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:15,380
You got done?
You shut the power off.

1122
00:49:15,940 --> 00:49:16,940
I'm back.
Anyway.

1123
00:49:17,510 --> 00:49:19,520
Um,
so how,

1124
00:49:19,750 --> 00:49:21,620
how did they fucking predict that so?
Well,

1125
00:49:22,490 --> 00:49:25,040
it's kind of like,
did you guys get like computers?

1126
00:49:25,041 --> 00:49:30,041
I'm like Steve Jobs or stuff that they 
like because of that whole show was 

1127
00:49:30,041 --> 00:49:33,251
about computers.
Did you have like the inside word where 

1128
00:49:33,251 --> 00:49:33,251
you.
Are you a prophet?

1129
00:49:34,210 --> 00:49:35,020
No,
I don't know.

1130
00:49:35,030 --> 00:49:37,440
You're a mormon.
You will be a profit deal.

1131
00:49:37,450 --> 00:49:40,130
Games been on set and stuff.
So I don't know about the computer thing

1132
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:42,590
I can as a kid.
How crazy.

1133
00:49:42,591 --> 00:49:44,870
You were like you were like kid porn for
us.

1134
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:46,970
You were like duty is a pac man machine.

1135
00:49:46,970 --> 00:49:51,050
He has a train.
You've got every single toy in the rural

1136
00:49:51,051 --> 00:49:54,140
and it was like we idolized you as kids 
at our age group.

1137
00:49:54,141 --> 00:49:57,610
I'm 36 so it's like duct phone.
Yeah.

1138
00:49:57,650 --> 00:50:02,630
It had like a remote control for my year
with Mr Aaron Gray Man.

1139
00:50:02,660 --> 00:50:05,270
If there was a tmz back during gray,
what would,

1140
00:50:05,330 --> 00:50:08,860
what would they have caught you doing?
What would them coming you?

1141
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:11,150
We'll be popping bottles,
hanging out the hotel.

1142
00:50:11,151 --> 00:50:16,151
Roosevelt with Alfonzo and Corey Haim 
and Corey Feldman back in 1986.

1143
00:50:17,540 --> 00:50:19,130
80 seven.
Roosevelt.

1144
00:50:19,131 --> 00:50:21,680
Wasn't nice really.
It was a dive.

1145
00:50:22,180 --> 00:50:24,860
What was back then,
was it dive club Hollywood,

1146
00:50:24,861 --> 00:50:27,340
you remember called Hotel Roosevelt.
Super Cool.

1147
00:50:27,341 --> 00:50:29,750
I remember,
I remember hearing about club Hollywood,

1148
00:50:29,751 --> 00:50:30,470
you know,
back in the day,

1149
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:35,500
like teen bop magazine Hollywood.
That was so weird,

1150
00:50:35,991 --> 00:50:38,090
man.
Corey Haim's dead.

1151
00:50:39,350 --> 00:50:40,310
Nobody saw that coming.

1152
00:50:43,890 --> 00:50:44,440
So.
Oh,

1153
00:50:44,810 --> 00:50:49,810
how weird is it that there's these kids 
that grew up with you that didn't make 

1154
00:50:49,810 --> 00:50:51,260
it through the net?
How weird is that to watch?

1155
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:53,090
Um,
yeah.

1156
00:50:53,091 --> 00:50:56,180
It's,
I feel really bad for the kid like Corey

1157
00:50:56,180 --> 00:50:57,710
Haim that you knew when he was a little 
kid.

1158
00:50:58,010 --> 00:50:59,340
Yeah.
He was so good to,

1159
00:50:59,341 --> 00:50:59,850
you know,
dude,

1160
00:51:00,020 --> 00:51:02,090
when he was little,
when the two of them weren't.

1161
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:04,310
What was that fucking vampire movie?
Lost Boys.

1162
00:51:04,460 --> 00:51:09,460
Just boys.
They were good in those movies that he 

1163
00:51:09,460 --> 00:51:09,460
was a good actor.
Yeah.

1164
00:51:09,460 --> 00:51:11,090
So you must have hung out with Michael 
Jackson.

1165
00:51:11,150 --> 00:51:12,920
And what did it taste like?
You remember that kid?

1166
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:19,280
Yeah.
I mean he was a real talent that was 

1167
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:19,280
crazy dying on sunset strip.
You know?

1168
00:51:19,970 --> 00:51:22,040
What about Michael Jackson used to hang 
out with them?

1169
00:51:22,490 --> 00:51:24,350
Michael Jackson visited the set of 
silver spoons.

1170
00:51:24,380 --> 00:51:25,590
Wow.
What was that like?

1171
00:51:25,610 --> 00:51:28,760
He was friends with Alfonzo who was my 
buddy on silver spoons,

1172
00:51:28,761 --> 00:51:33,761
you know,
Fonzo who was on the fresh prince right 

1173
00:51:33,761 --> 00:51:33,761
after source.
And what's his last name again?

1174
00:51:33,761 --> 00:51:35,690
Roberto Rivera Alfonzo.
So yeah,

1175
00:51:35,691 --> 00:51:38,780
he came to visit one day,
Michael Jackson and I'm hanging out with

1176
00:51:38,781 --> 00:51:41,480
Alfonzo.
Cause a fun commercial.

1177
00:51:41,540 --> 00:51:44,870
That was when he was the biggest star on
the planet ever.

1178
00:51:44,900 --> 00:51:45,680
Huge.
Yeah,

1179
00:51:45,681 --> 00:51:46,730
huge.
It was um,

1180
00:51:46,780 --> 00:51:51,780
that was going to tell about my book and
that was like through made me very 

1181
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:53,070
uncomfortable.
I don't really kiss on the lips.

1182
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:58,960
Was bullshitting.
He's Michael Jackson estate lawyers 

1183
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:00,480
down.
Do you think he fucked kids?

1184
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:05,510
You must've heard stories.
I don't know about anal,

1185
00:52:05,810 --> 00:52:09,240
but I think it might be.
Might have been some inappropriate stuff

1186
00:52:09,270 --> 00:52:12,350
if I had to guess,
like some hand jobs and I was like,

1187
00:52:12,351 --> 00:52:15,830
don't go over it.
Really.

1188
00:52:16,370 --> 00:52:19,190
I heard so many rumors about Michael 
Jackson and why he's,

1189
00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:19,970
he's,
you know,

1190
00:52:19,971 --> 00:52:22,880
why he was the way he was.
But you were actually there.

1191
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:26,120
What was he like?
Like I wanted to.

1192
00:52:26,121 --> 00:52:26,920
I mean,
I'll funds that,

1193
00:52:26,921 --> 00:52:29,360
went to the universal amphitheater,
wants to see him play,

1194
00:52:29,361 --> 00:52:32,780
and we went into his,
this was Billie Jean Times.

1195
00:52:32,870 --> 00:52:33,950
Yeah,
this is the time.

1196
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:36,410
So she of complaint it,
thrillers,

1197
00:52:36,411 --> 00:52:39,230
planet starting the universe.
And so,

1198
00:52:39,231 --> 00:52:41,690
um,
we're hanging out in his trailer and um,

1199
00:52:42,180 --> 00:52:43,910
you know,
just hanging out really nice quiet,

1200
00:52:43,911 --> 00:52:46,310
shy guy.
And so I'm like 16,

1201
00:52:46,311 --> 00:52:47,000
17.
I said,

1202
00:52:47,001 --> 00:52:47,750
Michael,
what's you,

1203
00:52:47,870 --> 00:52:51,540
how did you make it from a kid actor to 
an adult like this,

1204
00:52:51,541 --> 00:52:52,640
you know,
how did you survive?

1205
00:52:52,670 --> 00:52:56,390
Because I was kind of in the middle of 
transitioning from a kid to an adult.

1206
00:52:56,391 --> 00:53:01,391
And he said,
you know what the trick was being 

1207
00:53:01,391 --> 00:53:03,970
inspired ricky,
because I had to be inspired to keep it 

1208
00:53:03,970 --> 00:53:04,760
up.
And I had to find stuff that I wanted to

1209
00:53:04,761 --> 00:53:07,010
work on and wanting to do.
And you know,

1210
00:53:07,011 --> 00:53:08,720
I,
I kind of took that advice to heart,

1211
00:53:08,750 --> 00:53:10,460
you know,
but no,

1212
00:53:10,461 --> 00:53:12,560
nothing ever inappropriate.
And he started kissing her nipples.

1213
00:53:12,590 --> 00:53:16,460
Nothing inappropriate happened with me 
or that I know of.

1214
00:53:16,970 --> 00:53:19,070
He's such an odd.
He was such an odd guy,

1215
00:53:19,100 --> 00:53:22,410
just even the way his voice was.
And it was very strange.

1216
00:53:22,411 --> 00:53:23,740
It that's a man's voice,
just,

1217
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:26,190
it's such an odd character,
you know,

1218
00:53:26,340 --> 00:53:29,880
but never been a guy who was so much to 
get out.

1219
00:53:29,881 --> 00:53:34,881
I mean,
we talked about it last week and the 

1220
00:53:34,881 --> 00:53:36,291
podcast,
like how crazy it was watching them 

1221
00:53:36,291 --> 00:53:38,121
dance.
It's like nobody ever did anything like 

1222
00:53:38,121 --> 00:53:38,280
that before.
Like even though this Elvis did,

1223
00:53:38,281 --> 00:53:40,680
but he did in a different way.
He was,

1224
00:53:41,310 --> 00:53:43,800
he had a.
It was a weird thing of Sammy Davis.

1225
00:53:43,950 --> 00:53:45,690
He took some from Brown,
Jim Brown,

1226
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:47,010
James Brown,
James Brown.

1227
00:53:47,011 --> 00:53:52,011
We were talking about.
We would watch that on the podcast a 

1228
00:53:52,011 --> 00:53:52,011
couple weeks ago.
The opening and Zaire.

1229
00:53:52,011 --> 00:53:53,930
James Brown was like manly the way 
James.

1230
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:58,940
I was like,
it was more like a Michael Jackson did 

1231
00:53:58,981 --> 00:54:01,020
it.
It's more like gliding,

1232
00:54:01,021 --> 00:54:06,021
almost like alien type character.
It's moving around in perfect 

1233
00:54:06,021 --> 00:54:06,240
synchronicity.
It was like the more of a,

1234
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:08,880
more of a perfection to Michael 
Jackson's movements.

1235
00:54:08,881 --> 00:54:13,881
Whereas like James Brown was more of 
like raw sexuality that had the jet 

1236
00:54:13,881 --> 00:54:15,050
Michael Jackson Jacket.
Do you remember it?

1237
00:54:15,170 --> 00:54:20,170
Totally generic one though.
I can enter my family couldn't afford 

1238
00:54:20,170 --> 00:54:23,571
the real ones.
We got the generic one at this store 

1239
00:54:23,571 --> 00:54:23,571
called Gold Circle.
It looked exactly the same,

1240
00:54:23,571 --> 00:54:27,621
but there was some kind of tag the real 
one had and immediately everyone's like 

1241
00:54:27,621 --> 00:54:30,660
fake people had fake things.
Fake members only.

1242
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:34,960
I had a fake izod wasn't a crocodiles 
like something else or a flux.

1243
00:54:35,140 --> 00:54:38,040
Lizards have never crocodile.
That's a weird thing with kids,

1244
00:54:38,041 --> 00:54:38,720
right?
Yeah.

1245
00:54:39,010 --> 00:54:41,360
The need for brand names.
Shit on Bros.

1246
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:43,580
Spelled with a q.
What doeS that member?

1247
00:54:43,650 --> 00:54:44,870
This umbro shirts,
shorts.

1248
00:54:44,871 --> 00:54:46,350
He used to be real popular back in the 
day.

1249
00:54:46,780 --> 00:54:48,000
Same thing.
They have generic brands.

1250
00:54:48,001 --> 00:54:50,640
I was like columbo or this want to talk 
about popularity.

1251
00:54:50,641 --> 00:54:51,660
You have young kids.
Yeah.

1252
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:55,020
How the fuck is that?
Sagging things still in.

1253
00:54:55,410 --> 00:54:57,600
How the fuck are people sagging their 
pants still?

1254
00:54:57,630 --> 00:55:02,630
It's just like wearing pajamas pants to 
half their ass.

1255
00:55:03,090 --> 00:55:05,510
Half their ass and then they're pulling 
the belt on their pants.

1256
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:08,550
Stay on it to show you like how good 
they cleaned.

1257
00:55:08,620 --> 00:55:10,220
Seen tensions.
Now is back.

1258
00:55:10,290 --> 00:55:12,080
No dude,
I'm telling you.

1259
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:16,380
Whatever is back tight jeans style.
What people are doing.

1260
00:55:16,381 --> 00:55:19,770
Those guys are still sagging everywhere.
Everywhere I go,

1261
00:55:19,771 --> 00:55:24,771
I'm meeting kids in the crotch of their 
pants is by their knee and they can't 

1262
00:55:24,771 --> 00:55:26,820
even fucking walk while you're flying in
general and it's going to end.

1263
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:28,590
I don't think it's going to end.
That's what I'm telling you.

1264
00:55:28,591 --> 00:55:33,591
This has been around since I was in high
school and it was one of those things 

1265
00:55:33,591 --> 00:55:33,591
where I thought,
okay,

1266
00:55:33,591 --> 00:55:35,820
this is bell bottom jeans,
this is fucking wearing a visor.

1267
00:55:36,210 --> 00:55:37,470
This shit is gonna.
Go away.

1268
00:55:37,670 --> 00:55:39,040
You know?
It was back like,

1269
00:55:39,260 --> 00:55:42,480
I don't want people fucking sagged ha.
I remember parachute pants.

1270
00:55:43,780 --> 00:55:45,780
It wasn't as many,
but it was still.

1271
00:55:46,940 --> 00:55:51,940
It came from prison.
The whole thing comes from when you go 

1272
00:55:51,940 --> 00:55:55,071
to prison,
they take away your belt so you can't 

1273
00:55:55,071 --> 00:55:55,071
choke yourself.
Death.

1274
00:55:55,071 --> 00:55:55,920
We don't have a weapon either.
So your pants are sagging off and you're

1275
00:55:55,921 --> 00:56:00,921
losing weight because you're not eating 
as much as you were when you first got 

1276
00:56:00,921 --> 00:56:00,921
it,
you know?

1277
00:56:00,921 --> 00:56:00,921
Yeah.
Probably.

1278
00:56:00,921 --> 00:56:04,671
Or you're eating more debt yet.
Getting that hades food anyway.

1279
00:56:06,210 --> 00:56:07,300
That would suck.
Being in prison.

1280
00:56:07,410 --> 00:56:12,410
What story?
What could be worse than getting your 

1281
00:56:12,410 --> 00:56:12,410
freedom taken?
Oh no,

1282
00:56:12,410 --> 00:56:12,920
I think I'd rather be dead.
What's amazing is the,

1283
00:56:12,921 --> 00:56:15,140
all the different shit they can put you 
in position for,

1284
00:56:15,210 --> 00:56:16,950
you know,
so the webster story,

1285
00:56:16,951 --> 00:56:18,160
so,
so I'm,

1286
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:23,300
you know,
at one of these network junkets where 

1287
00:56:23,300 --> 00:56:24,130
you go to promote your show and stuff 
and all

1288
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:29,130
the other actors and cast or they're 
from the shows and this little man black

1289
00:56:29,531 --> 00:56:31,930
kid this tall was just cute as can be 
man.

1290
00:56:31,931 --> 00:56:36,931
And just like I put them on my knee and 
I started just playing with them and 

1291
00:56:36,931 --> 00:56:40,600
bounce them around and he was giggling 
and laughing and having a good time.

1292
00:56:40,601 --> 00:56:42,520
And then like,
you know,

1293
00:56:42,521 --> 00:56:43,930
I liked kids,
I've always liked kids.

1294
00:56:43,931 --> 00:56:48,931
So I laid the kid back and I blew like 
login is zuckerberg.

1295
00:56:50,230 --> 00:56:54,880
Dell calls it bloom a couple of shirts 
and he's like giggling like a little,

1296
00:56:55,090 --> 00:56:56,380
like a little four year old.
Right?

1297
00:56:56,500 --> 00:56:59,850
And I put them away and the below and go
ahead.

1298
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:02,800
Now I'm done playing with you and 
somebody comes over and says,

1299
00:57:02,801 --> 00:57:04,210
you know,
he's 16.

1300
00:57:08,470 --> 00:57:13,470
He didn't say anything.
He just laughed.

1301
00:57:14,290 --> 00:57:18,010
Oh my god,
that's the best story ever.

1302
00:57:18,190 --> 00:57:23,190
Oh my holy shit.
You fucking gave 16 year old webster on 

1303
00:57:24,981 --> 00:57:27,070
a one.
On a one to 10.

1304
00:57:27,071 --> 00:57:30,460
What was the embarrassment level when 
you found out he was your age?

1305
00:57:31,210 --> 00:57:33,240
I feel really.
What did you think?

1306
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:37,780
I feel bad and I felt gross.
Gross.

1307
00:57:38,530 --> 00:57:39,880
You apologize to him.
No,

1308
00:57:39,881 --> 00:57:41,390
I call them my again,
ever.

1309
00:57:42,270 --> 00:57:45,190
You didn't even apologize.
Where's he really laughing then when you

1310
00:57:45,191 --> 00:57:50,191
did or was he.
You had to go back and do it again 

1311
00:57:51,791 --> 00:57:53,740
today.
Would you apologize,

1312
00:57:53,890 --> 00:57:58,500
but I apologize.
I wasn't too bad.

1313
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:01,240
Too bad.
There's no cell phone cameras back then.

1314
00:58:01,241 --> 00:58:04,330
Can you imagine somebody filming that?
He pumped.

1315
00:58:04,570 --> 00:58:07,870
Melissa gilbert was teaching me to 
juggle that data and looked at a joel.

1316
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:08,580
How.
Okay.

1317
00:58:08,740 --> 00:58:09,030
Humbled.

1318
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:15,340
I thought he was like four or five.
I thought it was just like a little kid,

1319
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:17,140
you know,
if we can get them,

1320
00:58:17,141 --> 00:58:20,050
can we film and recreate it?
Reenact it.

1321
00:58:20,051 --> 00:58:24,010
What exactly happened with the awesome.
I met him once at the comedy store.

1322
00:58:24,011 --> 00:58:26,610
He's a very nice guy.
Really nice guy.

1323
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:29,200
He was very friendly.
A nice guy.

1324
00:58:29,490 --> 00:58:30,370
Yeah,
he was fine.

1325
00:58:30,371 --> 00:58:35,371
He was.
You guys tasted like sugar,

1326
00:58:38,130 --> 00:58:40,020
tastes like.
Do you remember what he tasted like,

1327
00:58:40,890 --> 00:58:43,450
honey?
It's old spice.

1328
00:58:43,940 --> 00:58:45,440
Only feel bad.
When I found out how old,

1329
00:58:45,470 --> 00:58:49,340
it was like,
whoa,

1330
00:58:52,010 --> 00:58:56,800
baby.
A fucking babies got razor stubble and a

1331
00:58:56,801 --> 00:59:00,100
tattoo.
Baby's got a hard on.

1332
00:59:00,101 --> 00:59:02,350
What the fuck?
Michael jackson's glove on his ass.

1333
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:04,420
Could you imagine?
How do you know him?

1334
00:59:04,421 --> 00:59:09,421
Well,
do you know when the first time he got 

1335
00:59:09,421 --> 00:59:10,801
laid off?
Gary coleman story was fascinating.

1336
00:59:11,231 --> 00:59:15,550
He was like 40 virgin virgin bridges.
It wasn't it.

1337
00:59:15,790 --> 00:59:17,920
He should have taken that money if I was
his advisor.

1338
00:59:18,130 --> 00:59:18,880
Okay.
And I would say,

1339
00:59:18,930 --> 00:59:19,660
I would say,
let's,

1340
00:59:19,661 --> 00:59:24,661
uh,
let's get rid of the showbiz 

1341
00:59:24,661 --> 00:59:24,661
aspirations.
Let's just let

1342
00:59:24,661 --> 00:59:24,661
it go.
We've got about 50 grand in the bank.

1343
00:59:24,661 --> 00:59:25,990
I think it's time to move to Thailand.
Things.

1344
00:59:26,030 --> 00:59:26,800
Time to go.
Thailand,

1345
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:28,490
Thailand.
You're a celebrity.

1346
00:59:28,550 --> 00:59:33,550
Okay.
You still got 50 grand will go a long 

1347
00:59:33,550 --> 00:59:33,550
goddamn way.
He can get yourself a nice girl.

1348
00:59:33,550 --> 00:59:35,440
Settle down in the jungle.
Lauren's.

1349
00:59:36,100 --> 00:59:37,790
Learn some moitai.
Go fishing.

1350
00:59:37,820 --> 00:59:39,290
Okay.
America is not for you.

1351
00:59:39,291 --> 00:59:42,410
So you're going to get some fucking.
The chick that did marry him,

1352
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:47,440
did you ever see the chicken married?
She took pictures on his deathbed when 

1353
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:51,700
she was looking at the rough,
like just get like a self portrait and 

1354
00:59:51,700 --> 00:59:53,360
he's fucked up with pipes.
Tubes coming out.

1355
00:59:54,070 --> 00:59:55,310
Oh,
it's beyond grows.

1356
00:59:55,311 --> 00:59:57,020
It's,
it's one of the darkest pictures.

1357
00:59:57,030 --> 00:59:59,780
I've seen a lot that I think I've ever 
seen on the internet.

1358
00:59:59,781 --> 01:00:01,850
It's true.
One of the darkest pictures because it's

1359
01:00:01,851 --> 01:00:06,851
just like the.
There's such a lack of love and respect 

1360
01:00:06,851 --> 01:00:10,430
and there's a lack of remorse and she's 
not sad that he's dying or if she is,

1361
01:00:10,431 --> 01:00:13,110
it's not that sad and terrible.

1362
01:00:13,270 --> 01:00:13,880
I don't know.
I mean,

1363
01:00:13,881 --> 01:00:15,380
who knows how he treated her,
you know,

1364
01:00:15,410 --> 01:00:16,370
of course,
treated like shit.

1365
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:18,560
He probably yelled at everybody,
but you know,

1366
01:00:18,561 --> 01:00:19,310
the guy's like,
yeah,

1367
01:00:19,430 --> 01:00:24,430
he was born fucked up.
Could you imagine just going through 

1368
01:00:24,430 --> 01:00:24,430
life going,
there's no way to fix this.

1369
01:00:24,740 --> 01:00:28,820
And he was so talented though.
Wasn't active when he was a kid.

1370
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:30,530
I mean,
he was amazing.

1371
01:00:30,531 --> 01:00:33,590
If you go back and rewatch,
what do you do if you associate guy like

1372
01:00:33,591 --> 01:00:35,450
that?
That's what the hard part is.

1373
01:00:35,850 --> 01:00:38,130
How do you transition from being,
you know,

1374
01:00:38,210 --> 01:00:43,210
I mean it's really,
I guess if you could write your own 

1375
01:00:43,210 --> 01:00:43,210
shit,
if you could write your own thing that's

1376
01:00:43,210 --> 01:00:44,720
really good about a guy who was in your 
situation,

1377
01:00:45,010 --> 01:00:46,550
you know,
then you could come up with some sort of

1378
01:00:46,551 --> 01:00:47,960
a show as an adult,
you know,

1379
01:00:47,961 --> 01:00:48,830
it's possible,
right?

1380
01:00:48,950 --> 01:00:49,210
Yeah.

1381
01:00:49,210 --> 01:00:49,970
Yeah.
I mean,

1382
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:53,810
but you got to adapt and morph and 
change and grow with the times.

1383
01:00:53,811 --> 01:00:58,811
And that's,
I think what happens to a lot of child 

1384
01:00:58,811 --> 01:00:58,811
actresses,
they kind of don't.

1385
01:00:58,811 --> 01:00:58,811
They also,
you know,

1386
01:00:58,811 --> 01:01:03,610
they're used to being treated a certain 
way and getting certain big paydays and 

1387
01:01:03,610 --> 01:01:07,300
certain big checks and when they,
when it's time to humble yourself and 

1388
01:01:07,300 --> 01:01:09,280
sort of start working again for less or 
you know,

1389
01:01:09,340 --> 01:01:11,660
start doing things that you may not 
really like,

1390
01:01:11,661 --> 01:01:12,980
they were.
Their egos are too big,

1391
01:01:13,430 --> 01:01:18,430
so you got to stay humble.
I think that's the one of the biggest 

1392
01:01:18,430 --> 01:01:19,450
heart and Aaron Aaron Gray helps.
Doesn't see Aaron Graves.

1393
01:01:19,660 --> 01:01:22,700
How hard is it useful?
Is it to stay humble?

1394
01:01:22,701 --> 01:01:23,900
That is the most hard thing,
right?

1395
01:01:23,910 --> 01:01:28,910
It's the most confusing thing is when 
you know that you're just a normal 

1396
01:01:28,910 --> 01:01:32,621
person,
but everybody treats you like you're 

1397
01:01:32,621 --> 01:01:32,930
special because you're a star,
like when you're on a set,

1398
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:37,960
if you're on a set like a sitcom,
it's so easy to lose your head because 

1399
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:41,681
everyone's kissing your ass and all the 
network people are all walking on 

1400
01:01:41,681 --> 01:01:41,681
eggshells around you.

1401
01:01:41,681 --> 01:01:43,100
They want to be really friendly with you
and everybody wants to be nice to you.

1402
01:01:43,101 --> 01:01:45,890
Everyone's got a big smile.
The show's doing well.

1403
01:01:45,891 --> 01:01:47,990
Everyone's got a big smile.
Everyone kisses your ass.

1404
01:01:47,991 --> 01:01:52,991
It's like you live in some weird and 
then you had an accountant and you got 

1405
01:01:52,991 --> 01:01:52,991
an a lawyer that kisses.
You're asking a publicist,

1406
01:01:52,991 --> 01:01:57,581
the kisses,
your asset manager and all these people 

1407
01:01:57,581 --> 01:01:57,581
that you're employing that kind of 
kissing your ass.

1408
01:01:57,581 --> 01:01:59,900
That's why it's important just to have 
real people.

1409
01:02:00,080 --> 01:02:02,540
It's very hard to pull off.
For some people,

1410
01:02:02,541 --> 01:02:07,250
it's very hard to get yourself out of 
that spiral of confusion,

1411
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:08,510
your identity confusion,
like,

1412
01:02:08,511 --> 01:02:09,380
who the fuck am I?
Yeah,

1413
01:02:09,381 --> 01:02:10,940
but my friends were always outside of 
hollywood.

1414
01:02:11,070 --> 01:02:12,260
That was important.
That's the most.

1415
01:02:12,460 --> 01:02:16,160
My friends are always just guys that 
were farmers or ranchers or hunters,

1416
01:02:16,170 --> 01:02:19,500
or if you just go knock on their door,
I'm schroeder and I'm for somebody.

1417
01:02:19,560 --> 01:02:21,150
Fellows.
Hunters play my video games.

1418
01:02:21,420 --> 01:02:24,360
Let me be your friend.
Fogger.

1419
01:02:24,450 --> 01:02:26,040
I've got one in my house.
What's up son?

1420
01:02:27,100 --> 01:02:30,290
You pat it dragon's layer dragons on 
set.

1421
01:02:30,500 --> 01:02:33,830
You did dragon's layer was the one where
it was a cartoon.

1422
01:02:34,540 --> 01:02:36,600
He did the right thing.
What was the lead character's name?

1423
01:02:36,650 --> 01:02:39,930
I love that.
That game would just suck him.

1424
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:45,000
I remember I go to western,
I was a kid and I bring like $40 a 

1425
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:48,521
quarters and just sit there and play all
night until I was sweating and mock 

1426
01:02:49,260 --> 01:02:51,350
three.
Remember that one Where it was like real

1427
01:02:51,351 --> 01:02:56,351
jet footage where it looks like you're a
plane and you were like shooting down 

1428
01:02:56,351 --> 01:02:57,470
things.
I remember a lot of those.

1429
01:02:57,471 --> 01:02:59,550
mock three.
Really remember dragon's lair.

1430
01:03:00,020 --> 01:03:02,040
That was the best call of duty's my game
though.

1431
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:05,150
Totally fucking so much,
dude.

1432
01:03:05,151 --> 01:03:07,070
When you go through the airport at that 
one,

1433
01:03:07,100 --> 01:03:09,110
you know you just start hmong people at 
the airport.

1434
01:03:09,110 --> 01:03:11,300
Have you played a multiplayer?
Oh dude,

1435
01:03:11,301 --> 01:03:12,480
you goT to do it online.
No,

1436
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:17,500
I've done the campaign,
but I like to play online against the 

1437
01:03:17,500 --> 01:03:17,500
kid.
I get a d.

1438
01:03:17,600 --> 01:03:19,010
You get addicted.
Get addicted.

1439
01:03:19,011 --> 01:03:24,011
Bad.
Do you play with the xbox or the 

1440
01:03:24,011 --> 01:03:24,011
playstation?
I have both,

1441
01:03:24,011 --> 01:03:24,450
but is that what you do with console to 
console?

1442
01:03:24,690 --> 01:03:25,850
Xbox,
but I usually.

1443
01:03:26,230 --> 01:03:29,960
I like pc games with keyboard and mouse.
You have much more control.

1444
01:03:30,170 --> 01:03:33,100
I like first person shooters.
I like playing like duals and quake.

1445
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:36,760
Low of call of duty.
Fucking freak out.

1446
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:38,710
Right?
He just remembers quake,

1447
01:03:39,540 --> 01:03:40,810
quake,
the call of duty.

1448
01:03:40,860 --> 01:03:41,380
No,
listen,

1449
01:03:42,040 --> 01:03:44,780
I have a show in his age.
Diction.

1450
01:03:45,020 --> 01:03:47,880
I have a real addiction to gamers know 
it's quake,

1451
01:03:48,190 --> 01:03:50,690
quake online stills the best game.
Literally 40,

1452
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:53,260
40 is tHe cutoff.
Literally I found out for what?

1453
01:03:53,261 --> 01:03:55,240
For like the video game junkies.

1454
01:03:55,480 --> 01:03:56,230
Oh,
that's nonsense.

1455
01:03:56,260 --> 01:03:58,030
Listen man,
the fuck you want.

1456
01:03:58,031 --> 01:04:00,010
You're not.
No one is making the rules.

1457
01:04:00,070 --> 01:04:02,320
No ones making the rules.
do what you enjoy doing.

1458
01:04:02,321 --> 01:04:03,400
All right.
This is all nonsense.

1459
01:04:03,401 --> 01:04:05,740
You're going to be dead some day.
Do what you like now.

1460
01:04:05,741 --> 01:04:08,920
Don't do what you'd like because you 
want to pretend to like it because other

1461
01:04:08,921 --> 01:04:10,240
people think you're sophisticated.
Then you're gonna.

1462
01:04:10,241 --> 01:04:11,890
Want to go on a fucking musicals and 
shit?

1463
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:16,920
You know what you like?
Video games are way better than 

1464
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:16,920
musicals.
Okay?

1465
01:04:16,930 --> 01:04:21,930
Video games are fun as fuck.
It doesn't matter if you're 80 years 

1466
01:04:21,930 --> 01:04:24,271
old.
If you fucking get some stereo 

1467
01:04:24,271 --> 01:04:26,071
headphones,
get a good fast cable internet line and 

1468
01:04:26,071 --> 01:04:26,700
get online and play some quake.
Holy shit dude.

1469
01:04:26,900 --> 01:04:31,900
People coming out of left side,
the right side of rockets flying at you 

1470
01:04:31,900 --> 01:04:32,500
and you fucking mellon people down with 
a lightning gun.

1471
01:04:32,530 --> 01:04:33,300
Craig,
I didn't.

1472
01:04:33,340 --> 01:04:35,950
Never even never heard acquaintance.
You're showing your age.

1473
01:04:35,951 --> 01:04:39,210
Son sheds ridiculous shit.
Joe.

1474
01:04:39,220 --> 01:04:44,220
I know you,
but if you played this game play on the 

1475
01:04:44,220 --> 01:04:44,220
computer,
you can play it on the computer.

1476
01:04:44,220 --> 01:04:46,070
Imagine that times 50 billion,
but what is it?

1477
01:04:46,090 --> 01:04:46,480
Okay.
Well,

1478
01:04:46,481 --> 01:04:48,130
tell me why it's so great.
Graphics.

1479
01:04:48,131 --> 01:04:53,131
One incredible low your mind and the 
weapons the weapons will blow your mind 

1480
01:04:53,131 --> 01:04:56,611
playing with like 50 other people at 
once will blow your mind and you can 

1481
01:04:56,611 --> 01:04:58,600
hide in trees and be a sniper if you 
weren't scared,

1482
01:04:58,830 --> 01:05:01,360
scared you should.
You Should take a week off.

1483
01:05:01,390 --> 01:05:02,930
I had a friend that he lost his mind 
once.

1484
01:05:02,931 --> 01:05:04,910
He was an actor.
he lost his mind wants and this dude had

1485
01:05:04,911 --> 01:05:06,730
never been in the military and he called
me up.

1486
01:05:06,760 --> 01:05:09,020
He goes,
if everything doesn't fucking pick up,

1487
01:05:09,050 --> 01:05:11,390
I'm thinking I'm just going to go to a 
rock and start killing people.

1488
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:12,270
Wow.
I'm like,

1489
01:05:12,360 --> 01:05:13,080
I'm like,
whaT?

1490
01:05:13,240 --> 01:05:14,300
I go,
what are you talking about?

1491
01:05:14,680 --> 01:05:15,890
And he's like,
you know what man?

1492
01:05:15,891 --> 01:05:17,000
Fuck it.
At this point in my,

1493
01:05:17,380 --> 01:05:19,710
I'm ready to join the mercenaries.
Like,

1494
01:05:19,720 --> 01:05:20,740
okay,
I can't talk to anymore.

1495
01:05:20,830 --> 01:05:23,900
I stopped talking to him last time.
We talked to him like,

1496
01:05:23,950 --> 01:05:28,950
I wonder if this dude is just been 
playing a lot of video games and it's 

1497
01:05:28,950 --> 01:05:28,950
like.
And he's like,

1498
01:05:28,950 --> 01:05:28,950
you know,
fuck it.

1499
01:05:28,950 --> 01:05:32,440
I'll just get a good fucking get fragged
go over there and end it all.

1500
01:05:32,710 --> 01:05:33,730
I wonder,
you know,

1501
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:39,720
what is it about,
you mean do you think people get 

1502
01:05:39,720 --> 01:05:39,720
desensitized playing video games?
So the idea of real war for sure.

1503
01:05:39,720 --> 01:05:41,530
That makes sense for sure,
but I don't think I'm making sense.

1504
01:05:42,790 --> 01:05:46,270
Has like totally fake like movement,
like the,

1505
01:05:46,290 --> 01:05:51,290
the,
the physics of the game are not human 

1506
01:05:51,290 --> 01:05:51,290
physics like you to jump further than 
you could ever really just about jumping

1507
01:05:51,300 --> 01:05:51,610
john.

1508
01:05:51,820 --> 01:05:56,820
You strafe jump and you can really go 
jumping sideways and you could walk it 

1509
01:05:56,820 --> 01:05:57,670
jump.
EspecIally playing rocket arena.

1510
01:05:57,671 --> 01:05:59,590
This is.
The physics are just crazy wild nobody.

1511
01:05:59,660 --> 01:06:04,660
Physics.
I think your games are like little 

1512
01:06:04,660 --> 01:06:04,660
little.
Yeah.

1513
01:06:04,660 --> 01:06:07,950
I'm not interested in that,
but I want to Catch a dude in midair 

1514
01:06:07,950 --> 01:06:09,970
with a rail gun.
Now I'm talking about makes it jump.

1515
01:06:10,060 --> 01:06:15,060
I boom.
I bet you if we get in here and we hook 

1516
01:06:15,060 --> 01:06:17,580
up our computers together,
I bet in within an hour fucking like,

1517
01:06:18,870 --> 01:06:19,870
it's crazy man.
I love you.

1518
01:06:19,871 --> 01:06:21,250
Shoot somebody through your head,
man.

1519
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:26,280
Like the whole wall behind you.
It's splattered with blood and in the 

1520
01:06:26,280 --> 01:06:29,431
game and the wall will start to have to 
pull out my flashlight right then and 

1521
01:06:29,431 --> 01:06:32,981
there.
If someone's fucking head explodes 

1522
01:06:32,981 --> 01:06:32,981
behind them,
I might just,

1523
01:06:32,981 --> 01:06:37,530
I might get a viking horn fucking my 
fleshlight and blowing my horn.

1524
01:06:41,590 --> 01:06:44,800
Dan's head exploded splattered against 
the wall.

1525
01:06:44,950 --> 01:06:49,950
There's got to be satisfying.
If you're a bad guy and you shoot 

1526
01:06:49,950 --> 01:06:49,950
somebody in their brain splattered 
against the wall,

1527
01:06:49,950 --> 01:06:50,650
that's got to be upset.
I mean,

1528
01:06:50,890 --> 01:06:51,460
you know,
it's not.

1529
01:06:51,750 --> 01:06:53,860
There's no positive carmen murder,
but You know,

1530
01:06:53,861 --> 01:06:58,560
you get an a for artistic effect.
have you been to um,

1531
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:02,950
I went to the New York and was doing 
nytd blue and I went to do research with

1532
01:07:02,951 --> 01:07:06,400
some cops there on how to be a cop and 
they took me to the morgue.

1533
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:09,820
Grew up into a morgue.
You to have an intense.

1534
01:07:09,850 --> 01:07:14,850
They had a wall like the size of that 
wall with polaroids over probably the 

1535
01:07:14,861 --> 01:07:19,861
last 30 years,
the most gruesome killings you've ever 

1536
01:07:19,861 --> 01:07:20,530
seen.
And I remember one,

1537
01:07:20,531 --> 01:07:25,531
jill,
the guY had put a double barrel shotgun 

1538
01:07:25,531 --> 01:07:28,291
in his mouth and pulled the trigger and 
his head had split perfectly down the 

1539
01:07:28,291 --> 01:07:29,560
middle and there was one on each 
shoulder.

1540
01:07:29,780 --> 01:07:31,960
His head was split and laying on the 
show,

1541
01:07:32,020 --> 01:07:34,060
one on each shoulder,
like perfect.

1542
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:37,090
And it was unbelievable.
But anyway,

1543
01:07:37,091 --> 01:07:37,820
um,
yeah,

1544
01:07:37,840 --> 01:07:38,890
it's,
he should've tweeted dose.

1545
01:07:38,891 --> 01:07:41,560
You need a twitter.
Unbelievable photographs.

1546
01:07:41,590 --> 01:07:43,840
God damn there was this one.
This girl.

1547
01:07:43,910 --> 01:07:48,910
We wanted this one crime scene.
The guys didn't want to pay this 

1548
01:07:48,910 --> 01:07:51,511
prostitute tossed off the roof,
bounced off the air conditioners 13 

1549
01:07:51,511 --> 01:07:52,950
floors down.
Oh god.

1550
01:07:53,470 --> 01:07:55,840
Crazy stuff.
Like real stuff.

1551
01:07:55,870 --> 01:07:58,540
Frigidaire.
They didn't want her on prostitutes.

1552
01:07:58,560 --> 01:08:02,230
So they threw her out the window.
Oh my god.

1553
01:08:02,260 --> 01:08:02,910
13.
Yeah,

1554
01:08:02,950 --> 01:08:07,950
13.
You can see the blood smears like it 

1555
01:08:07,950 --> 01:08:08,800
double offense against humanity.
I mean,

1556
01:08:08,801 --> 01:08:13,540
think about how empty you have to be to.
First of all,

1557
01:08:13,660 --> 01:08:16,160
you're not just getting this prostitute 
that you don't give a fuck about,

1558
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:18,470
but you're going to kill her rather than
pay her.

1559
01:08:18,720 --> 01:08:23,720
It's crazy.
You've taken someone's child and you 

1560
01:08:23,720 --> 01:08:24,020
fucked her and then you decide you 
don't.

1561
01:08:24,050 --> 01:08:29,050
You don't need your words,
your words are worth less than nothing 

1562
01:08:29,050 --> 01:08:29,690
worth less than nothing.
Row you out the window and have you die.

1563
01:08:29,691 --> 01:08:32,450
A slow,
horrible death bouncing off fucking shit

1564
01:08:32,451 --> 01:08:35,450
on the way down.
There's some animals out there,

1565
01:08:35,451 --> 01:08:36,590
man.
It's chilling.

1566
01:08:36,630 --> 01:08:41,630
You know,
one of the things that I've always said 

1567
01:08:41,630 --> 01:08:43,391
about the internet that is good as the 
internet allows you to see these things 

1568
01:08:43,391 --> 01:08:43,580
without coming into contact with these 
people.

1569
01:08:43,820 --> 01:08:48,820
I mean normally if you want to get that 
kind of an image and that kind of a 

1570
01:08:48,820 --> 01:08:52,900
visual,
you have to either go on patrol with 

1571
01:08:52,900 --> 01:08:52,900
comps or you have to,
you know,

1572
01:08:52,900 --> 01:08:53,600
someone has to bring or you get 
unfortunate.

1573
01:08:53,601 --> 01:08:55,220
You see it,
you know against your will,

1574
01:08:55,610 --> 01:08:59,840
but it's because of the internet.
You can go and find the shit out and see

1575
01:08:59,841 --> 01:09:02,270
it from the comfort of your own home and
just know,

1576
01:09:02,271 --> 01:09:04,490
okay,
now I know this should exist.

1577
01:09:04,530 --> 01:09:09,530
No know there's somebody like that out 
there because you didn't run it through 

1578
01:09:09,530 --> 01:09:09,530
your normal life.
You're not gonna meet.

1579
01:09:09,530 --> 01:09:11,210
Somebody wants to blow his fucking 
brains out with that.

1580
01:09:11,211 --> 01:09:16,211
Blow your brains out with a shotgun.
You need to know there's guys that are 

1581
01:09:16,211 --> 01:09:16,211
out there,
right?

1582
01:09:16,211 --> 01:09:18,460
You know,
it waS a competition in movie and um,

1583
01:09:19,330 --> 01:09:20,890
and uh,
18 years old,

1584
01:09:20,891 --> 01:09:25,891
19 years old,
brad pitt's in the movie were played 

1585
01:09:25,891 --> 01:09:25,891
runners together as moody called the 
cross the tracks.

1586
01:09:25,891 --> 01:09:26,470
So I think,
you know,

1587
01:09:26,500 --> 01:09:27,400
when you're 18,
you're tough.

1588
01:09:27,401 --> 01:09:30,040
So I'm in my porch.
Some jiving around compton,

1589
01:09:30,110 --> 01:09:32,530
stopped a hamburger and fries and a 
hamburger joint.

1590
01:09:32,531 --> 01:09:35,500
This is 1988.
The crack wars backwards or going on,

1591
01:09:35,501 --> 01:09:38,710
you would drive it around compton and a 
porsche in 1988.

1592
01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:41,290
This is nwa days,
right?

1593
01:09:41,680 --> 01:09:42,670
Yeah.
So you're 18.

1594
01:09:42,671 --> 01:09:44,890
You look at your 12.
I look like I'm 14 yet.

1595
01:09:44,891 --> 01:09:46,930
And you step out of a bad ass fucking 
car,

1596
01:09:47,930 --> 01:09:50,230
bitcH.
Shut ordering cheeseburger.

1597
01:09:50,290 --> 01:09:55,290
And this is really nice dude,
because that's when the black guy and 

1598
01:09:55,290 --> 01:09:55,290
he's like,
you know what's up ricky?

1599
01:09:55,290 --> 01:09:55,290
Silver spoons.
Love it,

1600
01:09:55,290 --> 01:09:55,750
man.
Love you.

1601
01:09:55,751 --> 01:09:57,880
And these really nice black people have 
always loved me.

1602
01:09:58,490 --> 01:10:00,460
I don't know why,
but they really dug silver spoons.

1603
01:10:00,850 --> 01:10:02,830
So anyway,
so we're talking a few minutes later,

1604
01:10:02,831 --> 01:10:06,060
I go back to the original mtv cribs.
I go to back to check it,

1605
01:10:06,340 --> 01:10:11,340
I go back to check on my car and there's
three guys in my car in your car and I 

1606
01:10:11,340 --> 01:10:12,500
didn't turn the alarm on.
My doors are open,

1607
01:10:12,501 --> 01:10:15,090
my hatches open and they're pulling the 
cd changer.

1608
01:10:15,100 --> 01:10:18,340
You remember back in the day that you 
had like an eight cd changer.

1609
01:10:19,030 --> 01:10:21,210
so they're ripped that out.
Oh my god.

1610
01:10:21,250 --> 01:10:24,160
Working on my blog,
punk on my radio drivers.

1611
01:10:24,730 --> 01:10:28,540
And so I ran over and they were like 
cracked out people and I said,

1612
01:10:28,541 --> 01:10:33,541
well get out of my car,
get out of my car and that they need to 

1613
01:10:33,541 --> 01:10:33,730
look at me.
They're like glanced at me and went back

1614
01:10:33,731 --> 01:10:34,670
to work.
What?

1615
01:10:34,840 --> 01:10:36,630
Wow.
Literally that was.

1616
01:10:38,020 --> 01:10:38,980
There was nothing I could do.

1617
01:10:39,010 --> 01:10:40,480
What the fuck was going through your 
head?

1618
01:10:40,500 --> 01:10:41,820
You're helpless.
You were how old?

1619
01:10:41,920 --> 01:10:46,920
Eighteen years old.
And they're ripping my blog on guy with 

1620
01:10:46,920 --> 01:10:46,920
their,
with their screen.

1621
01:10:46,920 --> 01:10:47,940
You don't have a cell phone back then 
and you paid.

1622
01:10:47,950 --> 01:10:52,950
somebody knows the guy that was.
I was in line with ordering hamburger 

1623
01:10:52,950 --> 01:10:53,050
cheeseburger,
really nice guy.

1624
01:10:53,620 --> 01:10:55,900
He comes around the corner when he sees 
my predicament and he goes,

1625
01:10:55,901 --> 01:10:56,860
rick,
what's going on and go,

1626
01:10:57,180 --> 01:10:59,020
these guys are ripping my stuff off.
And he goes,

1627
01:10:59,021 --> 01:10:59,950
okay,
I'll help you hold on.

1628
01:11:00,580 --> 01:11:05,580
And I watched him go to his truck and 
his car and he opens the trunk and he 

1629
01:11:05,580 --> 01:11:09,031
pulls out a shotgun this big wow with a 
pistol grip and he runs up to my car and

1630
01:11:09,251 --> 01:11:11,350
he points it at the guys in my car and 
he says,

1631
01:11:11,351 --> 01:11:13,090
get out of the motherfucking car.
I'm gonna kill you.

1632
01:11:13,650 --> 01:11:14,130
And all those

1633
01:11:14,130 --> 01:11:19,020
guys got right out of the my car man.
I got my car and he said,

1634
01:11:19,021 --> 01:11:20,060
ricky,
you gotta get outta here.

1635
01:11:20,061 --> 01:11:20,210
You know,

1636
01:11:20,590 --> 01:11:22,390
around here because I might just have a 
on youtube.

1637
01:11:22,500 --> 01:11:23,860
See,
that's the kind of shit that needs to be

1638
01:11:24,070 --> 01:11:24,230
to

1639
01:11:24,370 --> 01:11:29,370
wow.
I never stepped foot off the set again 

1640
01:11:29,370 --> 01:11:29,370
in compton.
Oh my god.

1641
01:11:29,370 --> 01:11:32,830
Holy shit.
So they just went right back to work.

1642
01:11:32,980 --> 01:11:35,120
Yeah,
just looked at me with christ.

1643
01:11:36,190 --> 01:11:37,540
But that one got shit my ass,
man.

1644
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:40,870
That guy did.
I wonder if you know,

1645
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:45,960
he was a gang member.
There's a world he had that little 

1646
01:11:45,960 --> 01:11:45,960
shotgun.
He was a gang banger.

1647
01:11:45,960 --> 01:11:46,850
There's a world of criminals that if 
you.

1648
01:11:46,900 --> 01:11:51,900
You're not from the world of criminals 
and somehow know that you fall into the 

1649
01:11:51,900 --> 01:11:53,840
world of criminals just accidentally 
stumbled into it like I did.

1650
01:11:53,950 --> 01:11:54,640
Yeah,
you are.

1651
01:11:54,641 --> 01:11:55,860
You're fucked me.
You don't.

1652
01:11:55,861 --> 01:11:57,340
You don't understand how everything is 
working.

1653
01:11:57,970 --> 01:12:02,970
The world of criminals does not work 
anything like the regular world of 

1654
01:12:02,970 --> 01:12:02,970
society.
When I was,

1655
01:12:03,450 --> 01:12:06,760
when I was 21 years old when I was,
I guess I was like 23 or 24.

1656
01:12:06,940 --> 01:12:11,940
I moved to New York from boston and I 
started hanging around with this dude 

1657
01:12:11,940 --> 01:12:12,620
who's a homeless pool hustler and a.

1658
01:12:12,670 --> 01:12:14,930
He was a really smart guy.
It's one of them.

1659
01:12:14,980 --> 01:12:16,750
He became my best friend.
Did he teach you a lot of pool?

1660
01:12:16,780 --> 01:12:19,120
Because she was great at pullman.
He played hIm.

1661
01:12:20,240 --> 01:12:23,290
He playing quake with him,
killed me and I'm pretty.

1662
01:12:23,490 --> 01:12:25,110
I'm not bad,
but he plays good.

1663
01:12:25,210 --> 01:12:30,210
He plays joseph sickness for games and 
right now the way I played pool is 

1664
01:12:30,210 --> 01:12:30,880
nothing like the way I used to play 
pool.

1665
01:12:31,180 --> 01:12:33,190
I used to play pool of eight,
10 hours a day.

1666
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:38,520
I put it all the time,
but I went from living in a suburban 

1667
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:40,040
boston newton,
Massachusetts to.

1668
01:12:40,210 --> 01:12:44,410
I'm just mostly doing taekwondo and 
competing and tournament's.

1669
01:12:44,590 --> 01:12:46,570
That's all I did like throughout my 
childhood playing pool.

1670
01:12:46,630 --> 01:12:51,630
And then I went from that to living in 
New York and not being around any of the

1671
01:12:51,911 --> 01:12:53,650
same people and then hanging out with 
his homeless pool,

1672
01:12:53,740 --> 01:12:58,740
hustler character and then finding 
myself in these fucked up situations 

1673
01:12:58,740 --> 01:12:58,930
with crazy people.

1674
01:12:58,930 --> 01:13:01,570
Like I'm taking him to buy crack at 
fucking 3:00

1675
01:13:01,571 --> 01:13:05,170
in the morning and he's got to and we 
were in harlem and he's going to like go

1676
01:13:05,171 --> 01:13:06,710
into this place.
I got the room,

1677
01:13:07,080 --> 01:13:10,060
I'm going to find the right place.
And he was fucked up and I was like,

1678
01:13:10,061 --> 01:13:11,410
what am I doing here?
And then,

1679
01:13:11,411 --> 01:13:16,411
you know,
there was a realization that if I got 

1680
01:13:16,411 --> 01:13:16,411
busted,
if we got pulled over when he was making

1681
01:13:16,411 --> 01:13:16,510
a bus,
they would take my car,

1682
01:13:16,720 --> 01:13:17,710
you know,
and helping him.

1683
01:13:17,711 --> 01:13:22,711
But I liked the guy,
but I was like completely out of my 

1684
01:13:22,711 --> 01:13:22,711
element.
I was like,

1685
01:13:22,711 --> 01:13:26,401
wow,
this is a creepy fucking world that I'm 

1686
01:13:26,401 --> 01:13:26,401
into.
All of a sudden I'm in this weird,

1687
01:13:26,401 --> 01:13:27,160
you know,
crackdown down

1688
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:29,090
thing happen to me against what happened
here.

1689
01:13:29,170 --> 01:13:30,690
Uh,
this girl used to date,

1690
01:13:30,691 --> 01:13:33,780
her roommate liked crack.
And so,

1691
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:34,830
uh,
she's like,

1692
01:13:34,860 --> 01:13:37,470
will you come with me and him because 
his car is broken,

1693
01:13:37,471 --> 01:13:38,370
you need to drive.
And I'm like,

1694
01:13:38,371 --> 01:13:39,390
okay,
what are we doing?

1695
01:13:39,391 --> 01:13:39,790
He's like,
oh,

1696
01:13:40,020 --> 01:13:41,970
we're just going to a friend.
He's going to pick up some shit.

1697
01:13:41,971 --> 01:13:43,440
and I thought there were just talking 
about weed.

1698
01:13:43,660 --> 01:13:48,660
So I get into this.
I walk into this house with these 

1699
01:13:48,660 --> 01:13:50,520
patients that didn't get in the basement
in the basement and it's a crack house.

1700
01:13:50,521 --> 01:13:52,290
I didn't even realized it was a crack 
house.

1701
01:13:52,530 --> 01:13:54,930
So I go downstairs,
there's people like crack everywhere.

1702
01:13:54,940 --> 01:13:57,720
There's this person at this table and 
I'm sitting there thinking,

1703
01:13:57,880 --> 01:14:02,880
all right,
I'm the only white guy here are except 

1704
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:03,560
for my girlfriend and two,
this is a crack house and these,

1705
01:14:03,630 --> 01:14:05,160
this is,
what the fuck am I doing there?

1706
01:14:05,220 --> 01:14:10,220
Of course nothing happened,
but I remember that was what it could 

1707
01:14:10,220 --> 01:14:10,220
have.
I was like,

1708
01:14:10,220 --> 01:14:11,100
that's the end of this hanging out with 
this girl.

1709
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:12,030
I

1710
01:14:12,240 --> 01:14:14,260
remember new jack city.
You got tHe tv hanging out.

1711
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:16,060
Remember when they had the crack 
factoring.

1712
01:14:16,210 --> 01:14:21,210
That shit was really going on.
Places where manufacturing crack this 

1713
01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:22,510
milky white.
What's his name?

1714
01:14:22,511 --> 01:14:24,760
Pooky.
Pooky member has a great movie.

1715
01:14:26,070 --> 01:14:31,070
Fuck drugs or that's the scariest.
People think that I'm like pro drugs 

1716
01:14:31,070 --> 01:14:32,740
because I'm pro marijuana and 
psychedelics,

1717
01:14:33,160 --> 01:14:38,160
but I'm pro nothing.
They get addicted to and nothing that 

1718
01:14:38,160 --> 01:14:38,350
can kill you.
You know there's.

1719
01:14:38,351 --> 01:14:40,210
There's shit that you should totally 
avoid.

1720
01:14:40,450 --> 01:14:42,220
I tell you what to try adderall now.
Yeah.

1721
01:14:42,221 --> 01:14:43,270
Well,
according to ari,

1722
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:46,340
I want to try it.
I've never heard.

1723
01:14:46,341 --> 01:14:50,470
He hasn't cleaned his house in forever.
Got on one adderall and fuck half of one

1724
01:14:50,530 --> 01:14:54,370
adderall and he cleaned his whole entire
place from like amazing.

1725
01:14:54,371 --> 01:14:59,371
Like he found trapper keepers from 12 
years ago with incredible hulk on it 

1726
01:14:59,371 --> 01:14:59,371
because I,
you know,

1727
01:14:59,371 --> 01:15:00,610
from a middle school kid they kidnapped 
or something.

1728
01:15:00,650 --> 01:15:05,650
Well,
adderall is supposed to be really 

1729
01:15:05,650 --> 01:15:08,491
powerful shit.
Robert told me he took it accidentally 

1730
01:15:08,491 --> 01:15:08,491
once.
Extra say.

1731
01:15:08,491 --> 01:15:09,820
Have you ever tried that?
I'm not really a fan of that.

1732
01:15:09,821 --> 01:15:11,200
I've never tried it.
I've learned a lot.

1733
01:15:11,201 --> 01:15:16,201
When I did,
actually I had a very powerful positive 

1734
01:15:16,201 --> 01:15:16,201
experience.
I learned a lot from it,

1735
01:15:16,201 --> 01:15:20,910
but I wouldn't do it again.
I did not like the way me and my brain 

1736
01:15:20,910 --> 01:15:20,910
field.
the next day.

1737
01:15:20,910 --> 01:15:23,690
My brain was very dull and it felt like,
like the way I described it,

1738
01:15:23,691 --> 01:15:26,740
it felt like a sponge where like most of
the water had been wrung out of it.

1739
01:15:26,741 --> 01:15:29,400
It just wasn't working right.
I couldn't make five.

1740
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:30,640
Mike couldn't make connections.
Right.

1741
01:15:30,670 --> 01:15:31,570
I was in a,
um,

1742
01:15:32,110 --> 01:15:37,110
like a starbucks and I was reading a 
magazine the next day I was reading a 

1743
01:15:37,110 --> 01:15:37,480
boxing magazine.
I couldn't read the magazine.

1744
01:15:37,510 --> 01:15:38,200
I couldn't read it.

1745
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:39,620
It was a story I wanted to hear about 
it.

1746
01:15:39,621 --> 01:15:40,480
You know,
I'm always,

1747
01:15:40,570 --> 01:15:45,570
always been a boxing fan.
I'm reading this matchup and I couldn't 

1748
01:15:45,570 --> 01:15:48,631
read it.
I couldn't put the words together and I 

1749
01:15:48,631 --> 01:15:48,631
was like,
fuck,

1750
01:15:48,631 --> 01:15:48,631
I can't read.
Well,

1751
01:15:48,631 --> 01:15:49,660
okay.
Whatever I did laSt night to have this,

1752
01:15:49,661 --> 01:15:51,970
you know,
fucking loving,

1753
01:15:52,290 --> 01:15:54,040
you know,
everybody's cool.

1754
01:15:54,041 --> 01:15:56,800
Let's all be friends in this beautiful 
positive,

1755
01:15:57,340 --> 01:16:00,910
enlightening experience the next day.
Like you paying for that shit for it.

1756
01:16:01,120 --> 01:16:01,990
I paid for.
And I was like,

1757
01:16:01,991 --> 01:16:03,040
okay,
I paid once.

1758
01:16:03,041 --> 01:16:05,170
I'm not paying again.
I know there's some shit that doesn't do

1759
01:16:05,171 --> 01:16:06,450
that.
I know that as a positive.

1760
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:11,480
It was a positive experience for me.
I realized like you realize when you do 

1761
01:16:11,480 --> 01:16:12,940
ecstasy,
a lot of what is possible.

1762
01:16:12,941 --> 01:16:17,941
If everybody dropped the bullshit,
you realize like how beautiful life 

1763
01:16:17,941 --> 01:16:19,930
would be if everybody was like super 
friendly and happy to see each other.

1764
01:16:20,250 --> 01:16:24,370
Like it would be way more fun and way 
more enjoyable than it is right now.

1765
01:16:24,730 --> 01:16:25,390
And you,
you know,

1766
01:16:25,391 --> 01:16:30,391
you realize that you can do your part to
kinda like make it lean in that 

1767
01:16:30,391 --> 01:16:33,631
direction.
So I think in that way it was very 

1768
01:16:33,631 --> 01:16:33,631
positive,
but I think those,

1769
01:16:33,631 --> 01:16:35,710
the elevated levels of brain hormones 
that you give yourself,

1770
01:16:35,711 --> 01:16:37,980
when you take that stuff,
there's a deficit like you,

1771
01:16:37,981 --> 01:16:42,981
you go up so then it crashes and then 
you don't have any left and then your 

1772
01:16:42,981 --> 01:16:42,981
brain is just like,
oh,

1773
01:16:42,981 --> 01:16:45,190
shitty and fucked up until it 
replenishes everything on its own.

1774
01:16:45,890 --> 01:16:48,820
I don't think that'S smart.
I don't think you should fuck with that.

1775
01:16:48,910 --> 01:16:50,500
There's other stuff that doesn't do 
that.

1776
01:16:50,530 --> 01:16:53,650
Mushrooms don't do that.
I'm scared to take terms again.

1777
01:16:53,651 --> 01:16:58,651
I want to so bad.
But the last time I ship for like six 

1778
01:16:58,651 --> 01:16:58,990
hours straight on shrooms and it was the
most craziest,

1779
01:16:59,110 --> 01:17:00,120
uncomfortable,
worse,

1780
01:17:00,121 --> 01:17:01,210
you know,
hanging out in the bathroom,

1781
01:17:01,250 --> 01:17:02,250
shitty shit.

1782
01:17:02,970 --> 01:17:07,970
ANd sometimes they make you shit because
it's like you're eating mushrooms are 

1783
01:17:07,970 --> 01:17:07,970
getting poisoned,
poisoned,

1784
01:17:07,970 --> 01:17:09,620
but they do have bacteria on them.
Sometimes.

1785
01:17:09,621 --> 01:17:11,670
They do have.
A lot of them have fungus on them.

1786
01:17:11,750 --> 01:17:14,940
They have to throw it up there,
not diarrhea.

1787
01:17:15,690 --> 01:17:17,860
A lot of people throw up,
some people's repeat,

1788
01:17:17,960 --> 01:17:19,940
some people throw up and that's when it 
really kicks in.

1789
01:17:19,970 --> 01:17:22,810
Just really kind of strategy.
You were shitting on trips or anything?

1790
01:17:22,820 --> 01:17:25,020
I remember looking at the.
I remember looking at the ground,

1791
01:17:25,021 --> 01:17:26,270
it was what?
Like a checkered pattern.

1792
01:17:26,271 --> 01:17:27,950
I remember the checkers are goiNg up and
down,

1793
01:17:27,951 --> 01:17:29,990
kinD of like texts tetris or something 
like that.

1794
01:17:29,991 --> 01:17:34,991
Like I saw like the heartbeat in the 
floor and it was while I'm shitting my 

1795
01:17:34,991 --> 01:17:35,000
brains out.
You know,

1796
01:17:35,300 --> 01:17:38,210
the crazy thing about the mushroom 
experiences individuals,

1797
01:17:38,211 --> 01:17:40,700
the crazy thing is that the feeling that
you get,

1798
01:17:40,730 --> 01:17:44,150
lIke you kind of get it now and it's 
just fleeting feeling.

1799
01:17:44,650 --> 01:17:46,370
It's like while you're on the mushrooms 
you like,

1800
01:17:46,371 --> 01:17:48,170
you get it.
It all seems to make sense.

1801
01:17:48,171 --> 01:17:51,180
It all seems to fall into place.
It's like there's a failure.

1802
01:17:51,350 --> 01:17:52,400
Yeah,
familiar with.

1803
01:17:52,420 --> 01:17:57,420
It's also,
there's like this in an enhanced level 

1804
01:17:57,420 --> 01:18:00,670
of understanding.
It's like all the bullshit that's going 

1805
01:18:00,670 --> 01:18:00,670
on in your head.
All the insecurities,

1806
01:18:00,670 --> 01:18:05,621
all the false assumptions,
all the things that are just like 

1807
01:18:05,621 --> 01:18:07,751
tripping up the Way you think.
They all get pushed to the side and the 

1808
01:18:07,751 --> 01:18:08,000
lights all get turned on.
You know?

1809
01:18:08,001 --> 01:18:10,430
That's what my experiences have been on 
mushrooms,

1810
01:18:10,450 --> 01:18:12,110
but no paranoia.
No,

1811
01:18:12,111 --> 01:18:16,520
my son had it all the time and every six
times maybe machines are annoyed.

1812
01:18:16,550 --> 01:18:20,090
Any anxiety and fucking bad trips and 
shitting myself.

1813
01:18:20,091 --> 01:18:20,440
Well,
it's.

1814
01:18:20,450 --> 01:18:23,390
I think it's when you try to control it,
it's very humbling.

1815
01:18:23,391 --> 01:18:25,580
Sometimes I think that it's just too 
strong or too,

1816
01:18:25,800 --> 01:18:27,860
like you said,
different molds and stuff,

1817
01:18:27,861 --> 01:18:28,630
so you're getting ready.

1818
01:18:29,320 --> 01:18:34,320
Yeah.
You don't know who the fuck's growing 

1819
01:18:34,320 --> 01:18:34,320
your mushrooms to.
Right.

1820
01:18:34,320 --> 01:18:34,320
Or making your lsd.
You know,

1821
01:18:34,320 --> 01:18:36,590
some people you hear stories of like 
crazy lsd makers.

1822
01:18:36,591 --> 01:18:39,710
I don't knoW what the fuck they're doing
and you're just pretty much fucking your

1823
01:18:39,711 --> 01:18:40,940
brain up.
Here's the story,

1824
01:18:40,941 --> 01:18:42,470
rick,
that you think it was fascinating.

1825
01:18:42,471 --> 01:18:43,970
We've talked about this before in the 
show.

1826
01:18:44,360 --> 01:18:49,360
The cia used to do experiments on 
american civilians in the 19 fifties 

1827
01:18:49,360 --> 01:18:53,920
against their will,
did a thing called operation midnight 

1828
01:18:53,920 --> 01:18:57,281
climax where the cia owned a brothel in 
san francisco and in New York and they 

1829
01:18:57,890 --> 01:19:02,890
got these guys are going to get laid and
they dosed them up with acid and ran 

1830
01:19:02,890 --> 01:19:04,010
tests on them.
That's how the cia.

1831
01:19:04,310 --> 01:19:09,310
Totally true.
Can we make that into a movie on here?

1832
01:19:09,321 --> 01:19:11,690
Ladies and gentleman?
This is the beginning.

1833
01:19:12,320 --> 01:19:14,900
What research do you have?
A rookie joey productions.

1834
01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:20,040
Really real.
It's true with operation midnight 

1835
01:19:20,040 --> 01:19:20,040
climax.
It's the freedom of information act.

1836
01:19:20,040 --> 01:19:21,590
They released these documents via 
random.

1837
01:19:22,570 --> 01:19:23,330
Yeah,
let's do it.

1838
01:19:23,610 --> 01:19:25,070
Real shit is crazy.
I know,

1839
01:19:25,071 --> 01:19:27,350
right?
But someone needs to do a documentary on

1840
01:19:27,351 --> 01:19:30,170
acid because people don't realize it 
because it was squashed out.

1841
01:19:30,171 --> 01:19:33,800
They threw so much water on the fire.
We don't and all died out so quickly.

1842
01:19:33,801 --> 01:19:36,890
We'd all don't realize people live today
in 2010.

1843
01:19:36,891 --> 01:19:40,250
Wouldn't impact acid had on the culture 
of the 19 sixties.

1844
01:19:40,280 --> 01:19:42,800
I mean people really were convinced that
we're all one.

1845
01:19:43,010 --> 01:19:45,740
The flower movement of san francisco,
the flower power movement.

1846
01:19:45,860 --> 01:19:48,140
Those people were all on acid.
What about disney,

1847
01:19:48,790 --> 01:19:49,700
etc.
I don't know.

1848
01:19:49,760 --> 01:19:52,370
What about.
What about disney did that stuff?

1849
01:19:52,580 --> 01:19:55,250
All lot of people have done acid.
I'm sure he probably did it.

1850
01:19:55,251 --> 01:19:56,990
How the fuck do you come with your 
mouse?

1851
01:19:57,350 --> 01:19:59,090
Unless you do an acid,
it's possible.

1852
01:19:59,120 --> 01:19:59,750
Who knows?
I mean,

1853
01:19:59,751 --> 01:20:04,751
it might not have,
but I think a lot of people did it 

1854
01:20:04,751 --> 01:20:04,751
because there was so many people doing 
it.

1855
01:20:04,751 --> 01:20:07,961
So many people reporting all these 
positive experiences on it that all 

1856
01:20:07,961 --> 01:20:07,961
these rich,
powerful people,

1857
01:20:07,961 --> 01:20:08,220
anyone

1858
01:20:08,220 --> 01:20:10,700
in a position that would get in contact 
with these people that are doing it,

1859
01:20:10,710 --> 01:20:12,030
these artists,
they would want to try it.

1860
01:20:12,390 --> 01:20:17,390
You know,
kEn keasy and timothy leary and all 

1861
01:20:17,390 --> 01:20:17,390
those kinds of terence mckenna,
all those dudes that are,

1862
01:20:17,390 --> 01:20:18,030
you know,
doing acid back then,

1863
01:20:18,060 --> 01:20:18,560
they,
they,

1864
01:20:18,610 --> 01:20:23,610
they,
they all wanted other people to do it 

1865
01:20:23,610 --> 01:20:23,760
much.
Mushrooms and acid and mushrooms.

1866
01:20:25,650 --> 01:20:26,340
Lsd.
Yeah.

1867
01:20:26,341 --> 01:20:27,390
It's man made.
I mean,

1868
01:20:27,391 --> 01:20:30,330
it does exist.
It exists actually in um,

1869
01:20:30,750 --> 01:20:32,730
in,
in some seeds of some plants.

1870
01:20:32,731 --> 01:20:36,000
A hawaiian baby.
Woodrow I think has it in it or it has a

1871
01:20:36,001 --> 01:20:38,820
similar compound in it.
And there's another one in morning glory

1872
01:20:38,821 --> 01:20:43,821
seeds.
Morning glory seeds has like a natural 

1873
01:20:43,821 --> 01:20:46,341
form of lsd.
You can buy morning glory seeds and you 

1874
01:20:46,341 --> 01:20:49,701
do something to them.
There's like directions how to do it 

1875
01:20:49,701 --> 01:20:51,531
online.
You make like you like cook them or 

1876
01:20:51,531 --> 01:20:55,200
something and then you eat them and you 
trip your fucking balls off.

1877
01:20:55,290 --> 01:20:58,350
Terence mckenna said that his first 
psychedelic experience was morning glory

1878
01:20:58,351 --> 01:21:03,351
seeds and then he had all this aztec 
imagery like he was looking at like 

1879
01:21:03,351 --> 01:21:06,510
fucking mayan temples and shit through 
the cloud of things like banana peels,

1880
01:21:06,511 --> 01:21:07,430
licking frogs.
What?

1881
01:21:07,450 --> 01:21:07,610
No,
no,

1882
01:21:07,620 --> 01:21:08,520
no,
but this is real,

1883
01:21:08,700 --> 01:21:10,770
but isn't the banana peel thing?
No.

1884
01:21:10,780 --> 01:21:11,670
No.
It's banana peels.

1885
01:21:11,671 --> 01:21:12,480
No real.
No.

1886
01:21:12,481 --> 01:21:17,481
Frogs are real.
There's certain frogs that produce man 

1887
01:21:17,481 --> 01:21:18,360
five meo dmt.
Yeah.

1888
01:21:18,361 --> 01:21:23,361
They sound on e bay.
I remember a long time ago I was 

1889
01:21:23,361 --> 01:21:23,361
actually going to buy one just to 
experiment with.

1890
01:21:23,361 --> 01:21:24,810
They say what you have to do.
You know how to do it.

1891
01:21:25,170 --> 01:21:30,170
Yeah.
There's a whole websIte devoted to do 

1892
01:21:30,170 --> 01:21:30,170
it.
I didn't say that.

1893
01:21:30,170 --> 01:21:33,610
What I heard is that you have to like 
make you rub them on glass and then 

1894
01:21:33,610 --> 01:21:36,450
their excretions or on the glass and 
then you drive excretions in the sun and

1895
01:21:36,451 --> 01:21:37,660
then you scrape it off and smoke it.

1896
01:21:37,690 --> 01:21:38,750
Is that.
Is that what you guys would play?

1897
01:21:38,760 --> 01:21:40,380
Something like that?
I didn't actually do it.

1898
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:41,070
Oh no,
no.

1899
01:21:41,071 --> 01:21:46,071
I was actually.
I talked to the breeder and he was just 

1900
01:21:46,071 --> 01:21:46,071
like,
I'm going to have a new batch soon.

1901
01:21:46,071 --> 01:21:47,100
I was going to buy like three of them,
but then I was like,

1902
01:21:47,101 --> 01:21:48,270
what am I doing?
I'm so stoned.

1903
01:21:49,870 --> 01:21:54,870
Locked frogs to trip the fuck out.
That five meo experience is a five.

1904
01:21:55,111 --> 01:21:57,420
Meo is still legal.
That's one of the weird things.

1905
01:21:57,421 --> 01:22:00,060
When I first did five mil,
we ordered it online.

1906
01:22:00,300 --> 01:22:02,420
Five meo dmt,
one of the most potent,

1907
01:22:02,450 --> 01:22:05,340
more potent than regular dmt psychedelic
drug,

1908
01:22:05,370 --> 01:22:10,370
and you could just order it online.
You can get like a vat of it and just 

1909
01:22:10,370 --> 01:22:11,970
smoke your fucking brains out.
It's way more powerful than mushrooms.

1910
01:22:11,971 --> 01:22:14,190
Way more powerful than pot and you can 
order it online.

1911
01:22:14,390 --> 01:22:19,390
If a candy flipped,
that's where they take ecstasy and put 

1912
01:22:19,390 --> 01:22:19,390
on one site is ecstasy on the other 
side,

1913
01:22:19,390 --> 01:22:20,370
lsd.
Oh my god,

1914
01:22:20,371 --> 01:22:22,370
what are you doing to your brain?
Candy flipping.

1915
01:22:22,530 --> 01:22:25,530
Fuck,
I can't handle it.

1916
01:22:26,370 --> 01:22:27,960
I'd see that's.
That goes into those.

1917
01:22:27,961 --> 01:22:30,030
Those weird.
Lose your mind forever.

1918
01:22:30,370 --> 01:22:31,470
You know,
trips.

1919
01:22:31,590 --> 01:22:33,810
I blamed the grateful dead and all that 
shit.

1920
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:35,620
Do you think you lost some brain cells 
particularly,

1921
01:22:35,700 --> 01:22:37,440
but you know,
I think I lost the most brain cells with

1922
01:22:37,441 --> 01:22:42,441
that one story I told you about where I 
rented this apartment and then my heat 

1923
01:22:42,441 --> 01:22:46,010
ended up being carbon dioxide from the 
gas furnace blowing on me for two years 

1924
01:22:46,010 --> 01:22:49,671
or a year.
Found out that day and moving out in my 

1925
01:22:49,671 --> 01:22:49,671
guys like,
you know,

1926
01:22:49,671 --> 01:22:50,990
checking over my room,
made sure I didn't destroy it.

1927
01:22:50,991 --> 01:22:51,870
And he goes,
what the fuck?

1928
01:22:51,871 --> 01:22:52,830
Why is that done?
Covered?

1929
01:22:52,920 --> 01:22:57,920
I'm like,
well that's my heat and the gas outtake 

1930
01:22:57,920 --> 01:22:58,950
for the gas furnace and is carbon 
dioxide easily.

1931
01:22:59,020 --> 01:23:00,670
There's many nights where me and this 
girl would be like,

1932
01:23:01,970 --> 01:23:05,320
am I?
Luckily it was such an old house.

1933
01:23:05,321 --> 01:23:06,130
It was drafty

1934
01:23:06,130 --> 01:23:07,910
so it wasn't like air tight or 
something.

1935
01:23:08,020 --> 01:23:11,680
You were getting points right?
I think that did the most damage I was.

1936
01:23:11,740 --> 01:23:12,490
No,
it wasn't that long.

1937
01:23:12,491 --> 01:23:14,410
It was actually like eight months or 
something like that,

1938
01:23:14,830 --> 01:23:16,970
but it's a different person.
Yeah,

1939
01:23:17,310 --> 01:23:19,150
I totally.
Looking back at that,

1940
01:23:19,151 --> 01:23:21,210
I think I definitely got some brain 
damage.

1941
01:23:21,230 --> 01:23:25,840
Mostly with your speech stuttery since 
then.

1942
01:23:25,870 --> 01:23:28,870
Oh my god.
And I just totally sue this place,

1943
01:23:28,871 --> 01:23:29,950
but now it's like,
what?

1944
01:23:30,010 --> 01:23:33,640
Twelve years later,
maybe the guy hit the lottery since then

1945
01:23:33,730 --> 01:23:37,410
and now you don't know.
You could get paid sign,

1946
01:23:38,100 --> 01:23:40,090
go get yours.
So it made you stutter?

1947
01:23:40,210 --> 01:23:40,930
Yeah,
kind of.

1948
01:23:40,990 --> 01:23:43,160
I think from that.
That's what I remembered the most.

1949
01:23:43,180 --> 01:23:48,180
Shit.
Well that one famous tennis player died 

1950
01:23:48,180 --> 01:23:48,660
like that.
Venus july litas have you die in the.

1951
01:23:48,910 --> 01:23:51,520
In this room by carbon monoxide 
poisoning.

1952
01:23:51,650 --> 01:23:53,890
But my heater just a couple of years 
ago,

1953
01:23:54,520 --> 01:23:56,770
not too long ago.
A reason to live somewhere where there's

1954
01:23:56,771 --> 01:23:59,560
no heat.
Bitch have electric cars

1955
01:24:00,050 --> 01:24:02,410
need to heat in California down here 
too.

1956
01:24:02,411 --> 01:24:04,480
It's so hot.
It's hot as fuck.

1957
01:24:04,810 --> 01:24:08,380
But what is better?
Hottest fuck or dry black ice,

1958
01:24:08,410 --> 01:24:09,700
you know,
that scares the shit out.

1959
01:24:09,750 --> 01:24:14,750
Like hot as fuck.
I like hot as fuck to me is better than 

1960
01:24:14,750 --> 01:24:15,100
you can't control your car because the 
fucking,

1961
01:24:15,430 --> 01:24:16,460
the whole,
you know,

1962
01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:18,520
highway becomes a,
an ice skating rink.

1963
01:24:18,550 --> 01:24:20,440
That's happened to me many times in 
boston.

1964
01:24:20,530 --> 01:24:22,540
Fucking hates.
But I grew up in boston.

1965
01:24:22,541 --> 01:24:27,541
I used to,
I drove every day because I delivered 

1966
01:24:27,541 --> 01:24:28,360
newspapers when I was a fighting,
doing taekwondo to make money.

1967
01:24:28,361 --> 01:24:29,770
I would deliver newspapers during the 
day.

1968
01:24:30,010 --> 01:24:32,290
Then I would teach classes and train and
then I would go and compete,

1969
01:24:32,560 --> 01:24:35,530
so when I would get up in the morning 
every morning at 5:00

1970
01:24:35,530 --> 01:24:37,510
AM,
a lot of times nobody had plowed,

1971
01:24:37,511 --> 01:24:41,230
nobody had done shit and I would just be
on just how to drive.

1972
01:24:41,230 --> 01:24:43,540
Unlike skating,
it was like a rink,

1973
01:24:44,070 --> 01:24:49,070
like I would slide around corners 
sideways on purpose because nobody was 

1974
01:24:49,070 --> 01:24:49,990
around like I knew how to handle it 
after awhile.

1975
01:24:50,020 --> 01:24:51,670
But boston bruins fan?
No,

1976
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:53,380
I don't really like sports.
Like sports.

1977
01:24:53,381 --> 01:24:58,381
Yeah.
I get bored with sports when I was 

1978
01:24:58,381 --> 01:24:58,381
young,
the moment I started doing martial arts,

1979
01:24:58,381 --> 01:24:59,800
I thought sports was stupid.
Taekwondo,

1980
01:24:59,801 --> 01:25:01,540
what's the dIfference between that and 
jujitsu?

1981
01:25:01,740 --> 01:25:02,150
Talking about.
no,

1982
01:25:02,151 --> 01:25:04,840
it was a striking art kicking.
Mostly kicking,

1983
01:25:04,990 --> 01:25:06,430
kicking and punching,
but mostly kicking.

1984
01:25:06,850 --> 01:25:09,790
That's what I was thrilled when I left.
Judo is throwing.

1985
01:25:09,791 --> 01:25:10,900
Yeah,
we talked about that last night.

1986
01:25:10,901 --> 01:25:12,490
I told rick he had to kill somebody with
a low jack.

1987
01:25:12,560 --> 01:25:16,880
Okay.
I'm telling them that if a dude

1988
01:25:17,570 --> 01:25:21,110
not understand jujitsu and he's an 
asshole and he has a jacket on,

1989
01:25:21,111 --> 01:25:26,111
that's why it's good to learn the gete,
learn how to use the game jujitsu 

1990
01:25:26,111 --> 01:25:29,140
because you know a lot of times people 
were in close and if some guy is 

1991
01:25:29,140 --> 01:25:29,140
attacking you and he's got a leather 
jacket on,

1992
01:25:29,140 --> 01:25:32,180
all you have to do is get your hand up 
in there under that collar,

1993
01:25:32,630 --> 01:25:34,790
deepen that collar on its neck,
and he's a dead man

1994
01:25:35,080 --> 01:25:38,090
dead because I'm going to connect on the
other side.

1995
01:25:40,580 --> 01:25:45,580
IT's nice to know.
I just need to know that environments 

1996
01:25:45,580 --> 01:25:47,530
teach you that room and then you just 
fuck with skiers all day.

1997
01:25:49,390 --> 01:25:51,620
She'd come up here with them.
Big shoes on pitch,

1998
01:25:51,880 --> 01:25:52,610
hang out,
snow,

1999
01:25:53,970 --> 01:25:56,250
but judo was the scariest thIng.
If a guy's got clothes on,

2000
01:25:56,251 --> 01:25:59,880
if you get in there with like some 
fucking jimmy pedro type character,

2001
01:25:59,900 --> 01:26:02,720
some know olympic judoka to grab ahold 
of your clothes,

2002
01:26:02,730 --> 01:26:07,730
man,
you'd gone sailing through the air and 

2003
01:26:07,730 --> 01:26:07,730
coming down on your fucking head on the 
concrete.

2004
01:26:07,810 --> 01:26:08,840
That's no joke,
man.

2005
01:26:08,900 --> 01:26:11,120
His karate pretty useless nowadays.
I don't know.

2006
01:26:11,121 --> 01:26:16,121
Karate is definitely not useless.
There's a lot of times if you have a 

2007
01:26:16,121 --> 01:26:16,610
black belt in karate though,
it depends on who you're getting it from

2008
01:26:16,670 --> 01:26:21,670
and there's a ton of different styles of
karate and even within those styles 

2009
01:26:21,670 --> 01:26:23,150
there's,
there's instructors that are much more,

2010
01:26:23,390 --> 01:26:23,800
you know,
they're,

2011
01:26:23,801 --> 01:26:28,801
they're,
they're much more pure with their 

2012
01:26:28,801 --> 01:26:28,801
technique there.
They're better.

2013
01:26:28,801 --> 01:26:28,801
They're,
they've,

2014
01:26:28,801 --> 01:26:32,350
you know,
they've competed in like international 

2015
01:26:32,350 --> 01:26:32,450
and world tournament's and you know,
you're always going to get levels.

2016
01:26:32,510 --> 01:26:37,510
There's karate guys like machida that 
are machIda's a bad mother fucker and 

2017
01:26:37,510 --> 01:26:41,141
his base,
his karate and he does the best things 

2018
01:26:41,141 --> 01:26:41,141
about karate.

2019
01:26:41,141 --> 01:26:41,141
He,
he's got a wide stance.

2020
01:26:41,141 --> 01:26:43,160
He stays back on the outside counter 
attacks.

2021
01:26:43,310 --> 01:26:48,310
he knows how to leap in and leap out 
very difficult to time because of that 

2022
01:26:48,310 --> 01:26:49,820
and very good at like leaping it almost 
like a fencer and tagging people.

2023
01:26:49,821 --> 01:26:50,930
he fucks people up,
man.

2024
01:26:50,931 --> 01:26:52,880
And that's karate.
He's used it for real,

2025
01:26:53,300 --> 01:26:55,550
but he's excellent at it.
That's the thing.

2026
01:26:55,790 --> 01:26:57,830
It's like karate is not the best martial
art,

2027
01:26:57,831 --> 01:27:01,100
but if you get really good at karate and
then learn the other shit,

2028
01:27:01,101 --> 01:27:03,040
you learn,
boy tie how to check kicks at it,

2029
01:27:03,041 --> 01:27:04,340
throw knees,
how to,

2030
01:27:04,341 --> 01:27:05,750
you know,
take a guy down and choke him.

2031
01:27:05,751 --> 01:27:07,800
You learned some jujitsu techniques,
fireballs,

2032
01:27:08,240 --> 01:27:10,000
fireballs,
fate.

2033
01:27:11,380 --> 01:27:13,430
If you learn all that stuff you can add 
to it.

2034
01:27:13,431 --> 01:27:18,431
But the thing about like karate that 
makes it interesting is that not that 

2035
01:27:18,431 --> 01:27:20,420
many people are doing it.
so if you get a guy who's a really good,

2036
01:27:20,421 --> 01:27:22,040
like really good,
lIke a,

2037
01:27:22,670 --> 01:27:24,260
like there's a bunch of different 
styles,

2038
01:27:24,261 --> 01:27:26,390
but kyoko shin is one that's a real good
one to show to cons.

2039
01:27:26,390 --> 01:27:31,390
Another one.
The shogun guys tend to be more like 

2040
01:27:31,390 --> 01:27:31,710
leap in and I like the drunken drunken 
monkey style.

2041
01:27:33,630 --> 01:27:34,940
Yeah.
Drunken monkey costume.

2042
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:36,020
That's real.
That shit.

2043
01:27:36,180 --> 01:27:38,230
One of the chinese tried everything man.
You know,

2044
01:27:38,640 --> 01:27:42,280
they tried all kinds of different 
fucking animal forms and grasshopper and

2045
01:27:42,281 --> 01:27:45,440
tackle like a praying mantis and fucking
poke you with your fingers and shit.

2046
01:27:45,860 --> 01:27:50,860
Chinese were like the most innovative 
coming up with different techniques for 

2047
01:27:50,860 --> 01:27:53,621
fighting.
What about this old school wrestling 

2048
01:27:53,621 --> 01:27:53,621
like you know,
roman greco,

2049
01:27:53,621 --> 01:27:53,940
greco,
greco,

2050
01:27:53,941 --> 01:27:57,290
roman wrestling?
Well,

2051
01:27:57,291 --> 01:27:59,230
it is in the fact that it's grappling.
It's,

2052
01:27:59,360 --> 01:28:00,980
it isn't the fact that you're,
you know,

2053
01:28:00,981 --> 01:28:02,660
you're still controlling a person's 
body,

2054
01:28:02,870 --> 01:28:05,540
but the intent is different.
What is no end point?

2055
01:28:05,541 --> 01:28:06,770
It's well,
it is.

2056
01:28:06,771 --> 01:28:08,480
They beat the fuck out of you.
Wants to hold you down.

2057
01:28:08,550 --> 01:28:11,000
Think about a wrestler is once they get 
you on your back,

2058
01:28:11,001 --> 01:28:11,690
you're fucked.

2059
01:28:11,780 --> 01:28:12,290
You know,
they're,

2060
01:28:12,291 --> 01:28:17,291
they're used to.
Their whole life has been dedicated to 

2061
01:28:17,291 --> 01:28:17,291
holding guys down and putting their 
shoulder to getting them.

2062
01:28:17,291 --> 01:28:21,701
Yeah.
So when they get on top of you and 

2063
01:28:21,701 --> 01:28:23,351
they're punching you,
they're holding you down and they're 

2064
01:28:23,351 --> 01:28:24,881
punching you and they're beating the 
fuck out of you or some of the most 

2065
01:28:24,881 --> 01:28:24,980
dangerous fighters in the world of 
wrestlers because the fact they have the

2066
01:28:24,981 --> 01:28:28,010
ability to dictate where the fight is.
Take where the fight takes place.

2067
01:28:28,040 --> 01:28:33,040
If they decide to take you down,
they take you down and if you want to 

2068
01:28:33,040 --> 01:28:33,040
take them down,
you can't.

2069
01:28:33,040 --> 01:28:33,740
They're better at wrestling than you,
so you're fucked.

2070
01:28:33,741 --> 01:28:36,770
So you have to do what they want to do.
If he wants to fight on the ground,

2071
01:28:36,771 --> 01:28:38,120
you have to find the ground.
If he wants to stand up,

2072
01:28:38,121 --> 01:28:40,460
you have to stand up.
It's a huge advantage.

2073
01:28:40,490 --> 01:28:42,400
So shoot.
Yeah,

2074
01:28:42,470 --> 01:28:43,250
he's a wrestler.
Yes,

2075
01:28:43,370 --> 01:28:45,740
definitely.
Bread recipe is a big part of mma.

2076
01:28:47,450 --> 01:28:50,420
Lesnar was a wrestler,
so it's his number one skill.

2077
01:28:50,600 --> 01:28:52,970
Brock is learning submissions was 
getting better with submissions.

2078
01:28:52,971 --> 01:28:54,950
He's an incredible athlete who's 
learning?

2079
01:28:54,951 --> 01:28:56,120
Striking.
He's getting better at it,

2080
01:28:56,121 --> 01:28:58,490
but his number one skills wrestling 
number one for sure.

2081
01:28:58,810 --> 01:29:01,020
Well it's always really good.
I was really good at taking guys down.

2082
01:29:01,030 --> 01:29:06,030
It's a big,
powerful fucking athletic guy who's got 

2083
01:29:06,030 --> 01:29:06,030
excellent wrestling technique.
He's learning all the other stuff.

2084
01:29:06,090 --> 01:29:08,820
Wrestling's number one thing it sounds 
like.

2085
01:29:08,850 --> 01:29:10,560
Yeah.
You just gotta understand jujitsu so you

2086
01:29:10,561 --> 01:29:15,561
don't get trapped.
You don't get caught into certain 

2087
01:29:15,561 --> 01:29:15,561
techniques because some guys were 
fucking dangerous off their back.

2088
01:29:15,561 --> 01:29:18,300
Like eddie eddie's very dangerous off 
back whenever I wrote with eddie.

2089
01:29:18,301 --> 01:29:19,440
I only rode with them like,
you know,

2090
01:29:19,670 --> 01:29:24,670
not that often,
but every time I think I'm safe when 

2091
01:29:24,670 --> 01:29:25,130
he's on his back and he catches me with 
something.

2092
01:29:25,470 --> 01:29:30,270
So like his legs are so dexterous.
He really knows the insides and outsides

2093
01:29:30,271 --> 01:29:33,540
of each and every position,
but a lot of guys don't have that.

2094
01:29:33,570 --> 01:29:38,570
You know,
there's only a few for breaching 

2095
01:29:38,570 --> 01:29:38,570
overdoing.
The guy just tapped out.

2096
01:29:38,570 --> 01:29:39,030
Fader or he's got that to even higher 
level.

2097
01:29:39,031 --> 01:29:41,520
His guard is nasty.
There's guys that you just,

2098
01:29:41,521 --> 01:29:44,310
you can't get comfortable with you if 
you're on top of them.

2099
01:29:44,460 --> 01:29:46,140
You can't get comfortable with,
you know,

2100
01:29:46,390 --> 01:29:51,390
they're always attacking.
They're always setting you up and 

2101
01:29:51,390 --> 01:29:51,390
they're always moving.
One step ahead of you.

2102
01:29:51,390 --> 01:29:52,390
Use zig when you should have zagged.
All of a sudden,

2103
01:29:52,710 --> 01:29:54,270
bang,
we got a triangle locked on,

2104
01:29:54,271 --> 01:29:55,380
motherfucker.
You're fucked.

2105
01:29:55,700 --> 01:30:00,700
Then you're trying to battle out of it,
but he knows which way you're going to 

2106
01:30:00,700 --> 01:30:02,781
go because if you go that way,
he's going to counter you by holding 

2107
01:30:02,781 --> 01:30:02,781
your leg and,
and pulling that up.

2108
01:30:02,781 --> 01:30:04,060
And now he aTtacks your arm,
then he attacks the triangle.

2109
01:30:04,110 --> 01:30:09,110
Next thing you know you're fucked 
because he's just got this high level 

2110
01:30:09,110 --> 01:30:09,540
shit.
But unless you're fighting those guys,

2111
01:30:10,200 --> 01:30:13,500
the most wrestlers are going to be able 
to pin a guy down and hold them down.

2112
01:30:13,770 --> 01:30:16,920
So huGe skill to hAve.
But I mean you must outweigh eddie by 40

2113
01:30:16,921 --> 01:30:17,700
pounds.
No,

2114
01:30:17,701 --> 01:30:19,810
not that much money.
And he's like one seventY,

2115
01:30:20,580 --> 01:30:22,740
85.
I think eddie's like one 65.

2116
01:30:23,040 --> 01:30:25,440
I bet you he's one 65.
So what do you want one 85?

2117
01:30:25,441 --> 01:30:27,030
One 90 2:25
pounds.

2118
01:30:27,420 --> 01:30:32,420
And I'm a lot stronger than him.
He's big and man I can't tap 'em I've 

2119
01:30:32,420 --> 01:30:32,760
never tapped him.
I don't think I've ever even come close.

2120
01:30:33,300 --> 01:30:38,300
well I've only made him struggling of.
I've never made them like real one day.

2121
01:30:38,491 --> 01:30:39,960
Will you?
Who knows,

2122
01:30:40,110 --> 01:30:41,940
Is it ticklish?
Most likely he'll tap me again.

2123
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,100
I don't do it nearly as much time into 
it as he does.

2124
01:30:44,101 --> 01:30:46,320
He teaches classes everyday and he 
trains everyday.

2125
01:30:46,710 --> 01:30:51,710
You know,
he's training when he teaches classes 

2126
01:30:51,710 --> 01:30:51,710
four nights a week.
He's got a knee injury right now.

2127
01:30:51,710 --> 01:30:51,920
So he's not training,
but uh,

2128
01:30:51,960 --> 01:30:53,400
when he does,
he's always rolling.

2129
01:30:53,401 --> 01:30:54,770
He rolls constantly.
I,

2130
01:30:54,830 --> 01:30:59,830
I'm lucky I'll get three days a weekend 
if I'm lucky and teaching to teaching a 

2131
01:30:59,830 --> 01:31:03,951
lot of guys,
lIke there's a dude named brent at our 

2132
01:31:03,951 --> 01:31:05,601
school who was really good,
but then he started teaching and he 

2133
01:31:05,601 --> 01:31:07,791
became great.
There's something about teaching people 

2134
01:31:07,791 --> 01:31:10,251
when you really dissect the techniques,
like they say that one of the best ways 

2135
01:31:10,251 --> 01:31:11,540
to improve your jujitsu game is to teach
it to somebody else that,

2136
01:31:11,550 --> 01:31:13,910
that tall light skinned black guy.
No.

2137
01:31:13,920 --> 01:31:16,260
Brent is a heavyset white guy.
Okay.

2138
01:31:16,530 --> 01:31:21,530
Big really smart dude.
And he's a brown belt under eddie and 

2139
01:31:21,530 --> 01:31:22,200
he,
he's a high level brown belt.

2140
01:31:22,200 --> 01:31:24,300
When he first started out,
he was just a regular guy,

2141
01:31:24,660 --> 01:31:25,790
you know,
just another dude who,

2142
01:31:25,860 --> 01:31:26,760
you know,
always good.

2143
01:31:26,810 --> 01:31:31,810
He was talented,
but when he started teaching also need 

2144
01:31:31,810 --> 01:31:31,810
to start taking off.
You know,

2145
01:31:31,810 --> 01:31:33,990
he's a handful,
very dangerous guy and every time I roll

2146
01:31:33,991 --> 01:31:34,680
with them I'm like,
whoa,

2147
01:31:34,710 --> 01:31:36,160
there's this certain guys that you roll 
with it.

2148
01:31:36,161 --> 01:31:39,570
You just gotta watch your p's and q's.
This guy's trying to kill you.

2149
01:31:39,900 --> 01:31:42,840
One thing I learned real quick was 
you're either all in or all out,

2150
01:31:42,870 --> 01:31:45,660
two hands in or two ends out.
If you got one hand in,

2151
01:31:45,840 --> 01:31:49,110
you know if,
if if you're on top and you put one hand

2152
01:31:49,111 --> 01:31:50,860
in,
they can somehow try.

2153
01:31:50,970 --> 01:31:52,350
They can show that.
Yeah,

2154
01:31:52,351 --> 01:31:54,840
you can grab your,
grab your arm and trap it.

2155
01:31:55,260 --> 01:31:56,880
You gotta be all in,
right?

2156
01:31:57,420 --> 01:31:58,710
Is that true?
Yes,

2157
01:31:58,711 --> 01:31:59,920
but you know,
even all in,

2158
01:31:59,921 --> 01:32:00,730
you've got to be careful.

2159
01:32:00,790 --> 01:32:03,920
If you get a guy like for overdoing and 
he controls both your wrists,

2160
01:32:03,921 --> 01:32:08,921
you're fucked.
You got a lot of problems because he's 

2161
01:32:08,921 --> 01:32:09,100
going to attack both ways and as you,
as you defend one way,

2162
01:32:09,101 --> 01:32:14,101
He's going attack the other way.
You know as If you control your risk at 

2163
01:32:14,101 --> 01:32:14,101
all,
you're fucked.

2164
01:32:14,101 --> 01:32:14,770
It's very important.
You get risk control.

2165
01:32:15,100 --> 01:32:19,540
Jujitsu is a such a tactical,
fun thing to do because as you do it,

2166
01:32:19,541 --> 01:32:24,541
it's very frustrating.
It's almost like you remember when you 

2167
01:32:24,541 --> 01:32:24,760
started doing standup comedy and he said
the frustrating thing is that there's no

2168
01:32:24,761 --> 01:32:25,600
end to this.
It's like,

2169
01:32:25,640 --> 01:32:28,210
it's like it's going to go on forever.
I'm going to take forever to get good at

2170
01:32:28,211 --> 01:32:33,211
it.
Know it's just a lot of devotion to 

2171
01:32:33,211 --> 01:32:34,510
something that you know you're going to 
have to go on forever.

2172
01:32:35,560 --> 01:32:38,190
It's going to take forever.
You see a guy like joey doc,

2173
01:32:38,270 --> 01:32:39,610
how the fuck am I ever going to get that
going?

2174
01:32:39,820 --> 01:32:42,100
It's going to take 15 years for me to it
for that.

2175
01:32:42,101 --> 01:32:43,930
Now that's the same feeling with 
jujitsu.

2176
01:32:43,960 --> 01:32:48,960
When you first start out,
you have to enjoy each little miniature 

2177
01:32:48,960 --> 01:32:49,960
battle that you win every every new 
lesson that you learned,

2178
01:32:50,140 --> 01:32:52,360
but the most humbling thing about it is 
as you do it,

2179
01:32:52,361 --> 01:32:57,361
you realize how little you know.
There's so many guys that are so much 

2180
01:32:57,361 --> 01:32:57,361
better.
There's just,

2181
01:32:57,361 --> 01:33:02,020
I'm like decent,
but there's so many guys that were all 

2182
01:33:02,020 --> 01:33:02,020
talking about marcella garcia last 
night.

2183
01:33:02,020 --> 01:33:04,720
He's the one of the best,
probably the best grappler in the world.

2184
01:33:04,780 --> 01:33:08,470
Really technical.
Not like this broodish powerful guy,

2185
01:33:08,471 --> 01:33:11,290
but just all technique and he says 
prezilians dude,

2186
01:33:11,320 --> 01:33:13,360
super,
super smart and super nice guy too,

2187
01:33:13,390 --> 01:33:16,660
and just fucks everybody up.
There's vIdeos of him online.

2188
01:33:16,661 --> 01:33:21,661
Just smashing guys,
just taking these really high level 

2189
01:33:21,661 --> 01:33:21,980
wrestlers.
Really tough guys are just running.

2190
01:33:22,720 --> 01:33:26,040
Just choking him,
choking jujitsu that okay.

2191
01:33:26,200 --> 01:33:27,880
Over and over and over again.
You know,

2192
01:33:27,881 --> 01:33:30,100
and watch this guy just running through 
people.

2193
01:33:30,320 --> 01:33:35,320
I'm in full guard like when somebody has
got me when I'm above someone and 

2194
01:33:35,320 --> 01:33:35,940
they've got ms.is
it called?

2195
01:33:36,010 --> 01:33:38,320
They've got me in full guard when 
they've got you in the garden,

2196
01:33:38,460 --> 01:33:40,500
in the garden trying to.
I don't even have a good movie.

2197
01:33:40,501 --> 01:33:42,820
You had to break out of the guard to get
onsite control.

2198
01:33:43,150 --> 01:33:44,040
You don't know.
Well,

2199
01:33:44,620 --> 01:33:49,620
I can show you some stuff.
There's a bunch of different techniques 

2200
01:33:49,620 --> 01:33:49,620
and you have a few go to moves.
Yeah,

2201
01:33:50,270 --> 01:33:54,260
gun by gun man.
It's a game.

2202
01:33:54,550 --> 01:33:55,750
If you treat it,
it looked.

2203
01:33:55,780 --> 01:34:00,780
If you treat it like penn and teller did
this thing on martial arts where they 

2204
01:34:00,780 --> 01:34:01,930
said that you're better off saving your 
money and then giving it to the mugger.

2205
01:34:02,200 --> 01:34:05,740
SavIng the money that you would,
but it's not about not getting mugged,

2206
01:34:05,770 --> 01:34:07,930
but martial arts are about is like it's 
a very,

2207
01:34:07,960 --> 01:34:11,500
very difficult thing that makes your 
character stronger.

2208
01:34:11,890 --> 01:34:14,050
When you learn martial arts,
when you're doing,

2209
01:34:14,051 --> 01:34:16,900
as you're doing this incredibly 
difficult thing and when you do that you

2210
01:34:16,901 --> 01:34:19,780
learn about yourself and other things 
become easier.

2211
01:34:20,070 --> 01:34:21,760
It's humbling.
It's very humbling.

2212
01:34:21,790 --> 01:34:23,920
It's humbling when some guys that you 
know,

2213
01:34:23,921 --> 01:34:24,760
you,
you look at him,

2214
01:34:24,761 --> 01:34:26,130
it doesn't look like much,
but man,

2215
01:34:26,410 --> 01:34:29,530
you're tapping now.
It's humbling too.

2216
01:34:29,620 --> 01:34:31,060
It's a,
it's a freaky feeling.

2217
01:34:31,450 --> 01:34:33,220
so freaky feeling to have guys dominate 
you.

2218
01:34:33,370 --> 01:34:35,090
And iT's a freaky feeling to dominate 
guys too.

2219
01:34:35,140 --> 01:34:37,480
It's a weird feeling.
It is better,

2220
01:34:37,481 --> 01:34:42,481
but it's weird to feel people nervous 
and freaking out and like when they 

2221
01:34:42,481 --> 01:34:42,481
first start doing it and shit and 
there's like,

2222
01:34:42,481 --> 01:34:47,320
you know,
they think they're tough guys and then 

2223
01:34:47,320 --> 01:34:47,320
they realize like,
you're closing in like,

2224
01:34:47,320 --> 01:34:47,710
this is getting to a position where,
fuck,

2225
01:34:47,890 --> 01:34:48,940
I'm not getting out of this.
You know,

2226
01:34:48,941 --> 01:34:53,941
you've got the dude mountain and he's 
bucking and just trying to explode all 

2227
01:34:53,941 --> 01:34:53,941
his energy,
but every time you do it,

2228
01:34:53,941 --> 01:34:54,100
you counter,
nope,

2229
01:34:54,150 --> 01:34:56,370
not going anywhere,
not going anywhere,

2230
01:34:56,720 --> 01:34:58,760
stay squash,

2231
01:34:59,230 --> 01:35:04,230
and you start slowly squishing them and 
squash them and you feel them panicking 

2232
01:35:04,230 --> 01:35:04,230
is feeling.
Start to freak out when they like,

2233
01:35:04,230 --> 01:35:05,960
they don't want to admit that you're 
going to kill them,

2234
01:35:06,230 --> 01:35:11,230
but that's really what it is.
They have to tap out and you have to 

2235
01:35:11,230 --> 01:35:11,230
say,
okay,

2236
01:35:11,230 --> 01:35:11,230
you're going to give you.
We're just going to kill me.

2237
01:35:11,230 --> 01:35:12,170
Right?
Thank you for not killing me.

2238
01:35:12,200 --> 01:35:15,830
And then you go again.
That's the craziest game ever and as you

2239
01:35:15,831 --> 01:35:17,450
get better,
as you get better at it,

2240
01:35:17,451 --> 01:35:20,300
you understand that it's really all 
about focus,

2241
01:35:20,390 --> 01:35:24,050
focus and energy and trying to put all 
the techniques together,

2242
01:35:24,320 --> 01:35:26,780
but then once you get them all together,
like once you drill them all and you get

2243
01:35:26,781 --> 01:35:31,781
them as a part of your repertoire,
then it just becomes this crazy zen 

2244
01:35:31,781 --> 01:35:31,781
thing where you don't even know what 
you're doing.

2245
01:35:31,781 --> 01:35:32,110
When you're doing it,
while you're.

2246
01:35:32,510 --> 01:35:34,280
While you're countering and attacking 
and everything.

2247
01:35:34,281 --> 01:35:36,920
It's like at all like it all plays 
itself out,

2248
01:35:37,370 --> 01:35:42,370
so it's like you drill,
you drill techniques to a certain point 

2249
01:35:42,370 --> 01:35:42,370
or when you're rolling they all just 
come out and natural.

2250
01:35:42,370 --> 01:35:47,201
Then it's crazy fun.
That's really fun and especially when 

2251
01:35:47,201 --> 01:35:50,531
you go with another guy who was really 
good too because you're just battling 

2252
01:35:50,531 --> 01:35:53,080
back and forth and countering back and 
forth and you don't even have time to 

2253
01:35:53,080 --> 01:35:53,080
think.
You're not thinking about your bills,

2254
01:35:53,080 --> 01:35:54,020
you're not thinking about shit.
You know,

2255
01:35:54,050 --> 01:35:57,510
thinking about you know your dog.
You're not thinking about your tire that

2256
01:35:57,910 --> 01:35:59,720
you're,
you're there in that moment,

2257
01:36:00,020 --> 01:36:05,020
but like in a zen way where you're not 
even thinking about yourself isn't so 

2258
01:36:05,020 --> 01:36:08,951
difficult.
you don't have the time to wander on 

2259
01:36:08,951 --> 01:36:09,020
your bullshit.
You have to keep your eye on.

2260
01:36:09,021 --> 01:36:12,090
This guy's trying to choke the fuck out 
of you again.

2261
01:36:12,680 --> 01:36:13,960
Have you been brian?
No.

2262
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:14,500
No.
I just,

2263
01:36:14,510 --> 01:36:18,500
I like croquet and it's not for him.
He likes cats,

2264
01:36:18,690 --> 01:36:22,520
cats and croquet,
and it's not for everybody,

2265
01:36:22,790 --> 01:36:25,040
but I knew it would be for you.
I'm glad you're doing it.

2266
01:36:25,041 --> 01:36:26,890
I knew it would be for you.
Totally loving them.

2267
01:36:27,290 --> 01:36:29,390
Loving it because especially when you 
tell me stories,

2268
01:36:29,630 --> 01:36:34,630
we went to dinner over his house and he 
tells me stories about trying to jack 

2269
01:36:34,630 --> 01:36:37,421
dudes and fucking backing up into him on
the highway and getting crazy on venice 

2270
01:36:37,421 --> 01:36:37,700
beach is the story I told you about?
Yeah,

2271
01:36:37,701 --> 01:36:42,701
you told me that story to my wife and 
kids driving down venice beach and I'm 

2272
01:36:42,701 --> 01:36:44,870
on a bike and this other kid on a 
skateboard,

2273
01:36:44,871 --> 01:36:49,871
20 years old,
we kind of bumped into each other by 

2274
01:36:49,871 --> 01:36:49,871
accident.
NoboDy's fault.

2275
01:36:49,871 --> 01:36:51,680
And so we kind of untangled each other 
from each other and I just decided to go

2276
01:36:51,681 --> 01:36:56,681
on my way and as he's leaving he's like,
you stupid motherfucker get out of my 

2277
01:36:56,681 --> 01:36:59,480
way next time and he's like 20 years old
and I'm like,

2278
01:36:59,570 --> 01:37:00,650
fuck you asshole.

2279
01:37:01,040 --> 01:37:04,940
And immediately he turns around and he's
like,

2280
01:37:05,300 --> 01:37:07,190
I challenged him,
I guess by saying that.

2281
01:37:07,610 --> 01:37:12,610
And immediately he turns around,
but he's got like four friends With him 

2282
01:37:12,610 --> 01:37:13,550
all 20 years old.
And my wife was like,

2283
01:37:13,610 --> 01:37:14,090
rick,
what?

2284
01:37:14,091 --> 01:37:16,820
You're such a dick for responding to 
that.

2285
01:37:17,300 --> 01:37:19,130
And I'm like,
well how can I not?

2286
01:37:19,160 --> 01:37:20,390
I mean,
the kids 20 years old,

2287
01:37:20,391 --> 01:37:22,880
I'm 40.
You don't treat people like that,

2288
01:37:23,090 --> 01:37:24,410
you know,
and in the world,

2289
01:37:24,411 --> 01:37:27,080
but you gotta you gotta I understand 
that,

2290
01:37:27,081 --> 01:37:29,000
but you've got to recognize that these 
kids,

2291
01:37:29,001 --> 01:37:32,360
a lot of them have nothing to lose and 
their reputation means too much.

2292
01:37:32,960 --> 01:37:35,930
The reputation means anything.
So if you're not around kids like that,

2293
01:37:35,950 --> 01:37:37,640
if you,
if you challenge the kid like that,

2294
01:37:37,641 --> 01:37:42,641
like he was in la,
I didn't consciously though do it 

2295
01:37:42,641 --> 01:37:44,210
instinctual just to respond.
Correspond on the worst.

2296
01:37:44,230 --> 01:37:47,240
I'm captain,
caveman when any issue like that.

2297
01:37:47,241 --> 01:37:49,490
I have to fight off every.
That's my biggest.

2298
01:37:50,270 --> 01:37:52,060
That's my biggest weakness actually.
it's essential.

2299
01:37:52,610 --> 01:37:56,220
It's natural reacting instead of 
responding

2300
01:37:57,150 --> 01:37:58,500
legally.
It's not an issue,

2301
01:37:58,501 --> 01:38:00,090
I don't think because he's fucking with 
you.

2302
01:38:00,350 --> 01:38:01,710
You know he starting with you and fuck 
you.

2303
01:38:01,890 --> 01:38:03,170
That'S not the issue,
but the issue is your,

2304
01:38:03,210 --> 01:38:08,210
your health and safety.
They could just ask you or got you 

2305
01:38:08,210 --> 01:38:08,220
situation.
Well,

2306
01:38:08,221 --> 01:38:13,221
it doesn't matter for sure for sure.
It really not even jujitsu because you 

2307
01:38:13,221 --> 01:38:14,980
don't want to grapple with the garlic 
that you want to fucking one tomb.

2308
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:18,780
You want to put them to sleep and then 
charge it the next guy and just let them

2309
01:38:18,781 --> 01:38:23,781
know,
this is how quick I can put this due to 

2310
01:38:23,781 --> 01:38:23,781
sleep.
I'm going to get you next because that's

2311
01:38:23,781 --> 01:38:26,190
the last thing anybody wants is one dude
knocking out everybody,

2312
01:38:26,520 --> 01:38:27,540
so when the.
When.

2313
01:38:27,600 --> 01:38:29,790
If you have to attack somebody,
you're better off.

2314
01:38:29,820 --> 01:38:32,220
Way better off learning how to strike.
You don't want to let go.

2315
01:38:32,221 --> 01:38:33,540
yeah,
watch me pull guard,

2316
01:38:33,541 --> 01:38:37,680
bitch,
fucking soccer,

2317
01:38:37,681 --> 01:38:38,240
kicking you in.

2318
01:38:38,950 --> 01:38:42,240
Not the best thing to learn.
If there's a bunch of people,

2319
01:38:42,241 --> 01:38:44,520
the best thing to have is fast fucking 
hands.

2320
01:38:44,740 --> 01:38:48,470
You'd be able to just light somebody up 
just cause you want to somebody,

2321
01:38:48,720 --> 01:38:53,720
especially in the street,
especially if they don't know how to 

2322
01:38:53,720 --> 01:38:53,720
fight.
When that punch actually lands pop,

2323
01:38:53,720 --> 01:38:55,530
bam and their eyes roll back in their 
head.

2324
01:38:55,710 --> 01:38:57,720
They're not even going to expect a that 
you're gonna.

2325
01:38:57,721 --> 01:38:59,130
Be able to hit him that hard,
be they're gonna.

2326
01:38:59,131 --> 01:39:01,470
Be able to do it that quick,
like most dudes have never really.

2327
01:39:01,620 --> 01:39:03,500
Boxing never really been punched,
you know,

2328
01:39:03,510 --> 01:39:06,030
so if you can just find one dude and pop
bank,

2329
01:39:06,330 --> 01:39:08,070
just put that to sleep.
The other guy was going to go,

2330
01:39:08,130 --> 01:39:10,890
oh fuck this.
Then you can get them to scatter,

2331
01:39:10,891 --> 01:39:15,891
but if you try to do some jujitsu,
they should have a movie like like the 

2332
01:39:15,891 --> 01:39:15,891
credit card.

2333
01:39:15,891 --> 01:39:19,460
But for jujitsu,
the jujitsu kid where the guy says 

2334
01:39:19,460 --> 01:39:21,891
really good at jujitsu,
got like this little kid could make it 

2335
01:39:21,891 --> 01:39:24,291
more like a judge into art.
It's kind of weird and the jujitsu is a 

2336
01:39:27,271 --> 01:39:31,470
real martial art in the sense that you 
can defeat a much bigger,

2337
01:39:31,471 --> 01:39:33,060
stronger,
more athletic person.

2338
01:39:33,061 --> 01:39:35,700
It's very hard to do that with striking 
like you can.

2339
01:39:35,701 --> 01:39:38,490
It can be done if a guy's an elite 
striker and he's facing goes.

2340
01:39:38,520 --> 01:39:40,260
Not elite stryker.
That's much dan henderson,

2341
01:39:40,261 --> 01:39:41,310
right?
Lead striker.

2342
01:39:41,311 --> 01:39:44,170
Dan henderson is really a wrestler.
He's a very powerful striker,

2343
01:39:44,430 --> 01:39:46,650
but he's not in the line of st anderson 
silva.

2344
01:39:46,651 --> 01:39:48,560
Anderson silva is like an elite striker.
He's.

2345
01:39:48,630 --> 01:39:53,630
He's a guy who really knows the 
intricacies of the standup game dan 

2346
01:39:53,630 --> 01:39:54,660
henderson does as well,
but you know,

2347
01:39:54,661 --> 01:39:59,661
he's more known as a wrestler because I 
saw him take out that british guy with 

2348
01:39:59,661 --> 01:39:59,661
one punch.

2349
01:39:59,661 --> 01:40:01,210
Well,
he can knock anybody's best paint.

2350
01:40:01,240 --> 01:40:03,150
Yeah.
He's got super power in his hands.

2351
01:40:03,390 --> 01:40:08,390
He can knock anybody.
He knocked out vandelay silva with one 

2352
01:40:08,390 --> 01:40:10,461
punch.
He's knocked out a lot of guys with one 

2353
01:40:10,461 --> 01:40:10,461
punch,
you know,

2354
01:40:10,461 --> 01:40:10,461
but then he's not known as a striker.
Right.

2355
01:40:10,461 --> 01:40:12,870
He's not known as like a technical 
strike.

2356
01:40:12,900 --> 01:40:14,420
What about chuck ladell?
Yes.

2357
01:40:14,430 --> 01:40:15,960
He's,
he's a striker.

2358
01:40:16,230 --> 01:40:18,900
Is he fighting again?
I don't know.

2359
01:40:19,020 --> 01:40:21,390
I don't know.
I think he has made you think so.

2360
01:40:21,800 --> 01:40:23,750
Yeah.
Maybe you know,

2361
01:40:24,030 --> 01:40:28,230
it's your time becomes up when it's up.
It's up.

2362
01:40:29,340 --> 01:40:30,990
He had one of the greatest careers of 
all time.

2363
01:40:31,340 --> 01:40:32,590
You know,
I just think it's,

2364
01:40:32,600 --> 01:40:35,100
think at a certain point in time you 
have to be concerned about your health.

2365
01:40:35,460 --> 01:40:36,960
You know,
you have to be concerned about,

2366
01:40:36,980 --> 01:40:41,980
you know,
how many knockouts you take and you 

2367
01:40:41,980 --> 01:40:41,980
know,
concerned about your future here.

2368
01:40:41,980 --> 01:40:42,300
This is fucking incredible,
amazing career.

2369
01:40:42,480 --> 01:40:47,480
The problem is,
you know you have that kind of a fire 

2370
01:40:47,480 --> 01:40:50,151
burning inside you.
It's very difficult to turn that shit 

2371
01:40:50,151 --> 01:40:50,151
off,
you know,

2372
01:40:50,151 --> 01:40:50,151
very,
very,

2373
01:40:50,151 --> 01:40:50,151
very,
very,

2374
01:40:50,151 --> 01:40:53,000
very difficult to turn that shit off.
Those guys like you,

2375
01:40:53,140 --> 01:40:54,280
they're not.
They're there.

2376
01:40:54,310 --> 01:40:57,820
Their whole fucking system is wired for 
competition.

2377
01:40:58,240 --> 01:41:00,700
Host system is wired for combat for the 
moment,

2378
01:41:00,701 --> 01:41:03,280
for getting to that cage under the 
bright lights and performing,

2379
01:41:03,570 --> 01:41:08,570
you know,
their whole self esteem is based on 

2380
01:41:08,570 --> 01:41:08,570
their ability to rise to a place that 
most men can ever get to.

2381
01:41:08,660 --> 01:41:10,390
Do you think they could transfer that 
easily?

2382
01:41:10,391 --> 01:41:12,640
TheY're like,
start playing video games or start doing

2383
01:41:12,641 --> 01:41:13,250
something else.

2384
01:41:15,420 --> 01:41:20,420
I don't think we as civilians could ever
Possibly understand the highs that it 

2385
01:41:20,981 --> 01:41:25,981
must be.
When chuck liddell fucking throws his 

2386
01:41:25,981 --> 01:41:28,111
arm backs and it's pushing his chest out
and screams after he knocks people out 

2387
01:41:28,111 --> 01:41:29,050
of.
After he knocked randy coture out,

2388
01:41:29,051 --> 01:41:34,051
let me ready to go into is one of the 
baddest motherfuckers on the planet and 

2389
01:41:34,051 --> 01:41:35,200
he connects.
Bam and randy goes down and that high is

2390
01:41:35,201 --> 01:41:39,490
probably cocaine times a billion.
It's prObably insane.

2391
01:41:39,491 --> 01:41:42,250
It's probably.
He probably never feels more alive.

2392
01:41:42,251 --> 01:41:46,660
He probably never feels more energetic,
more fulfilled.

2393
01:41:46,720 --> 01:41:49,700
This incredible eight week training camp
everyday,

2394
01:41:49,750 --> 01:41:54,750
waking up for this one moment and 
finally it comes against one of the 

2395
01:41:54,750 --> 01:41:55,780
baddest motherfuckers on the planet in 
front of 16,000

2396
01:41:55,781 --> 01:41:57,880
people in a fucking arena.
Everybody's going crazy.

2397
01:41:58,100 --> 01:41:59,170
Your punch connect.

2398
01:42:02,170 --> 01:42:03,880
They live for that moment that they live
for.

2399
01:42:03,881 --> 01:42:08,881
It was nutty and they strap the belt on 
him and then they asked them,

2400
01:42:12,411 --> 01:42:13,420
you know,
so what's next?

2401
01:42:13,450 --> 01:42:14,260
Anybody?
I don't care.

2402
01:42:14,261 --> 01:42:19,261
I'll fight anybody.
I'll find anybody in the world like to 

2403
01:42:19,261 --> 01:42:20,890
fight.
It's hard to step down from that,

2404
01:42:20,891 --> 01:42:22,180
I think.
I think that's a,

2405
01:42:22,260 --> 01:42:24,880
that's a full copy of highlight.
You haven't comedy.

2406
01:42:25,920 --> 01:42:28,390
Comedy is more just fun.
We're having a good time,

2407
01:42:28,450 --> 01:42:30,370
but aren't as much as to.
yes,

2408
01:42:30,371 --> 01:42:33,340
you sure you have fun.
It's a different kind of high though.

2409
01:42:33,610 --> 01:42:34,240
It's,
it's,

2410
01:42:34,241 --> 01:42:36,670
um,
it's not nearly as is crazy.

2411
01:42:36,671 --> 01:42:39,220
It's not nearly as primal.
It's more fun.

2412
01:42:39,270 --> 01:42:44,270
Enjoyable.
Everybody havinG a positive experience 

2413
01:42:44,270 --> 01:42:46,651
together.
We're all party and we're all having a 

2414
01:42:46,651 --> 01:42:46,651
good time.
You know,

2415
01:42:46,651 --> 01:42:46,651
I'm telling you some comedy.
You're laughing.

2416
01:42:46,651 --> 01:42:48,010
We're enjoying our time together.
It's all fun.

2417
01:42:48,490 --> 01:42:50,020
Fighting is much more,
you know,

2418
01:42:50,021 --> 01:42:55,021
you trying to master something and it 
just so happens there's an audience 

2419
01:42:55,021 --> 01:42:56,290
there watching it,
but it's totally different experience.

2420
01:42:56,290 --> 01:43:01,290
Very inward.
You trying to overcome some guys 

2421
01:43:01,290 --> 01:43:03,721
physical strengths and you impose your 
will on him and pose your conditioning 

2422
01:43:03,721 --> 01:43:05,260
and your preparation on them.
It's like wake ways different way.

2423
01:43:05,261 --> 01:43:09,100
Crazier comedy is like everyday normal 
bullshiT to me.

2424
01:43:09,101 --> 01:43:12,880
I can go on stage right now if there was
an open mic right next door and then you

2425
01:43:12,881 --> 01:43:14,050
know,
while we're doing the podcast,

2426
01:43:14,051 --> 01:43:14,620
someone said,
hey joe,

2427
01:43:14,621 --> 01:43:15,630
you want to do 10 minutes?
I'm like,

2428
01:43:16,210 --> 01:43:16,740
yeah,
I'll go.

2429
01:43:16,741 --> 01:43:17,620
I'll go,
I'll go up.

2430
01:43:17,740 --> 01:43:19,320
I'll just go up and start fucking I'm 
what's up,

2431
01:43:19,321 --> 01:43:20,080
what's up,
what's going on?

2432
01:43:20,081 --> 01:43:22,390
And I'll just start doing standup.
Just going into mack.

2433
01:43:22,540 --> 01:43:24,520
I couldn't go fight,
you know,

2434
01:43:24,610 --> 01:43:25,180
couldn't say,
hey,

2435
01:43:25,181 --> 01:43:26,350
do you want to cage fighting?
Ten minutes.

2436
01:43:26,970 --> 01:43:28,120
I'd Be like,
no,

2437
01:43:28,121 --> 01:43:30,850
I need like 10 months and I got to talk 
to my mom.

2438
01:43:31,990 --> 01:43:33,370
Fucking get a nutritionist,
man.

2439
01:43:33,371 --> 01:43:35,410
I gotta make sure my strength and 
conditioning programs in order.

2440
01:43:35,660 --> 01:43:40,660
Fuck,
who am I fighting as he was driving a 

2441
01:43:40,660 --> 01:43:40,660
wrestler?
I gotta prepare my,

2442
01:43:40,660 --> 01:43:43,051
you know,
what am I going to want to fight a 

2443
01:43:43,051 --> 01:43:43,051
striker?
How I get fucked up.

2444
01:43:43,051 --> 01:43:43,051
You knoW,
you,

2445
01:43:43,051 --> 01:43:43,300
you know,
are you going to a scarier.

2446
01:43:43,320 --> 01:43:44,360
Where's it going to play you?
No.

2447
01:43:44,620 --> 01:43:48,660
Why not?
Because it's not healthy because I must,

2448
01:43:48,720 --> 01:43:51,920
I must want to fight.
He must to fight to do it.

2449
01:43:51,921 --> 01:43:55,460
I did a lot of competition.
Martial arts competition was young where

2450
01:43:55,461 --> 01:44:00,461
I enjoyed it,
but I got out of it without any 

2451
01:44:00,461 --> 01:44:03,220
complications physically because of 
injuries are knockouts or anything like 

2452
01:44:03,220 --> 01:44:03,220
that,
but I knew people who did.

2453
01:44:03,220 --> 01:44:07,990
I know people had complications.
I knew people who had brain damage for 

2454
01:44:07,990 --> 01:44:11,411
sure from boxing and it's compromised to
how they talk and it's compromised how 

2455
01:44:11,411 --> 01:44:13,820
they can think and make reason,
reasonable decisions.

2456
01:44:14,150 --> 01:44:15,080
I've met people like that.

2457
01:44:15,410 --> 01:44:16,970
I don't think there's anything wrong 
with fighting.

2458
01:44:16,971 --> 01:44:21,971
I don't think we're all,
we're not going to live forever and I 

2459
01:44:21,971 --> 01:44:23,891
think every man should be allowed to 
make his own decisions as to what he 

2460
01:44:23,891 --> 01:44:23,891
wants to do and how long he wants to 
compete.

2461
01:44:23,891 --> 01:44:28,691
And you know,
how many knockouts he wants to take and 

2462
01:44:28,691 --> 01:44:28,691
how much risk he wants to put his body.
It's up to you.

2463
01:44:28,691 --> 01:44:29,150
It's your choice.
Why is it,

2464
01:44:29,180 --> 01:44:31,820
why is it that you can go and do 
motorcycle riding?

2465
01:44:32,030 --> 01:44:35,060
You can run betWeen the fucking lanes 
and traffic and that's okay.

2466
01:44:35,330 --> 01:44:36,380
But you know,
you can't,

2467
01:44:36,410 --> 01:44:38,600
you a guy can't get knocked out more 
than three times.

2468
01:44:38,601 --> 01:44:41,570
He can do whatever the fuck you want.
But for me,

2469
01:44:41,690 --> 01:44:46,690
I think um,
I think if you were going to put 

2470
01:44:46,690 --> 01:44:48,500
yourself at risk,
there should be an end point to it.

2471
01:44:48,710 --> 01:44:53,710
And to me it's like what are we gonna do
with it and be the best guy in the 

2472
01:44:53,710 --> 01:44:53,710
world?

2473
01:44:53,710 --> 01:44:53,710
No.
Am I going to win a couple of fights?

2474
01:44:53,710 --> 01:44:54,590
What's it going to prove?
You know?

2475
01:44:54,591 --> 01:44:55,280
Well,
you know,

2476
01:44:55,320 --> 01:44:56,690
the thrill of competition.
Yeah.

2477
01:44:57,080 --> 01:45:00,080
And maybe getting your fucking face 
broken again.

2478
01:45:00,330 --> 01:45:01,190
You know,
maybe getting.

2479
01:45:01,191 --> 01:45:03,890
I've had my nose fixed recently and it's
fucking awesome.

2480
01:45:03,891 --> 01:45:05,490
I love having my nose again.
Great.

2481
01:45:05,990 --> 01:45:08,180
My whole life I'd have fucked up jammed 
up nose.

2482
01:45:08,181 --> 01:45:13,181
I broke my nose falling down a flight of
stairs when I was five and then I've 

2483
01:45:13,181 --> 01:45:16,780
been kicked and punched in the face.
I don't know how many times my whole 

2484
01:45:16,780 --> 01:45:16,780
life,
so it was all fucked.

2485
01:45:16,780 --> 01:45:17,420
But what's cool is you don't have 
anything to prove.

2486
01:45:17,700 --> 01:45:20,060
You know,
we don't need because you are tough,

2487
01:45:20,300 --> 01:45:25,300
but that's silly.
There's a lot of people out there that 

2488
01:45:25,300 --> 01:45:25,300
can kick my ass.
The needing to prove thing.

2489
01:45:25,300 --> 01:45:25,630
It should all be,
you know,

2490
01:45:25,640 --> 01:45:27,680
you should.
No one should need to prove anything.

2491
01:45:27,680 --> 01:45:29,020
And if you do need to prove something to
you,

2492
01:45:29,220 --> 01:45:30,920
you can just find out more about 
yourself.

2493
01:45:30,980 --> 01:45:32,420
You know,
when you need to prove something.

2494
01:45:32,630 --> 01:45:34,850
Like this guy's out there that are 
trying to start fights or guys that are,

2495
01:45:34,851 --> 01:45:39,851
you know,
people that have a chip on their 

2496
01:45:39,851 --> 01:45:41,471
shoulder.
What they need to do is get more 

2497
01:45:41,471 --> 01:45:44,350
positive experiences in their life,
get more things would they have 

2498
01:45:44,350 --> 01:45:44,870
accomplished their emotion,
but they've conquered their emotions and

2499
01:45:45,080 --> 01:45:47,090
accomplish the goal.
That seemed really difficult to do.

2500
01:45:47,091 --> 01:45:48,620
And they understand more about 
themselves.

2501
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:51,020
And that's one of the things about like 
mma fighters,

2502
01:45:51,021 --> 01:45:53,540
like some of the best guys in the world,
they're super friendly.

2503
01:45:53,930 --> 01:45:58,930
George st pierre is one of the nicest 
people I have ever met in my life and 

2504
01:45:58,930 --> 01:46:01,880
he's one of the baddest motherfucker is 
pound for pound on the planet and saying

2505
01:46:01,910 --> 01:46:05,150
he's so kind and so friendly and 
genuine.

2506
01:46:05,360 --> 01:46:07,370
And the reason is he doesn't have 
anything to prove to anybody.

2507
01:46:07,371 --> 01:46:11,390
He proves it to himself in competition.
He proves it to himself in training.

2508
01:46:11,600 --> 01:46:13,850
He proved it,
proves it to himself with discipline,

2509
01:46:14,030 --> 01:46:16,610
forcing himself to do the hard work to 
become great.

2510
01:46:16,611 --> 01:46:19,340
And he is great and recognize as great.
So because of that,

2511
01:46:19,341 --> 01:46:21,770
he's balanced and he's like super 
healthy,

2512
01:46:21,950 --> 01:46:26,950
super calm person to be around.
A couple of years ago I watched him 

2513
01:46:26,950 --> 01:46:28,070
fight against that brazilian guy and it 
was a great fight.

2514
01:46:28,100 --> 01:46:30,950
Thiago silva and I think elvis rather.
Excuse me.

2515
01:46:31,530 --> 01:46:33,290
It was a tie striker.
Yeah.

2516
01:46:33,291 --> 01:46:35,030
That guy was strong.
Oh yeah.

2517
01:46:35,150 --> 01:46:37,070
And he couldn't sell them.
That's a monster.

2518
01:46:37,071 --> 01:46:42,071
St pierre couldn't submit them.
Now the distance I hope has is he's a 

2519
01:46:42,071 --> 01:46:43,280
beast,
but he has a problem making weight,

2520
01:46:43,330 --> 01:46:44,810
didn't make weight for his last fight.
Again,

2521
01:46:45,110 --> 01:46:48,230
rematch with john fitch and he didn't 
look that good physical.

2522
01:46:48,230 --> 01:46:53,230
He looked like he looked like he was a 
little hurt by the weight cut because 

2523
01:46:53,230 --> 01:46:55,500
he's so big in real life.
He's supposed to fight at one 70,

2524
01:46:55,710 --> 01:46:58,860
but he walks around over 200,
so he's cutting.

2525
01:46:58,920 --> 01:47:03,340
He's dehydrating himself like 30 pounds 
and then try to replenish himself and it

2526
01:47:03,341 --> 01:47:08,341
just you.
There's going to be a point of a point 

2527
01:47:08,341 --> 01:47:11,481
of diminishing returns where you cut so 
much weight and you dehydrate yourself 

2528
01:47:11,481 --> 01:47:13,320
so much that your performance is going 
to suffer.

2529
01:47:13,380 --> 01:47:14,910
Yeah.
He's just so big.

2530
01:47:15,450 --> 01:47:18,480
He was giant.
Giant for one 70.

2531
01:47:18,481 --> 01:47:21,750
They're gigantic.
He's a fucking bull of a man.

2532
01:47:22,310 --> 01:47:23,850
You know?
He's just gOtta lose some weight.

2533
01:47:23,880 --> 01:47:25,740
It's got to lose some muscle.
She had too much.

2534
01:47:26,100 --> 01:47:27,830
What's so fuNny?
A bowl of it,

2535
01:47:27,920 --> 01:47:28,860
man.
That's what he Is.

2536
01:47:30,420 --> 01:47:32,590
He isn't bowl.
What would you call it?

2537
01:47:32,620 --> 01:47:34,350
The power.
What would you call them?

2538
01:47:34,390 --> 01:47:36,590
And very nice gentlemen.
Nice gentlemen.

2539
01:47:36,591 --> 01:47:37,640
Yeah,
he's a nice gentleman.

2540
01:47:37,641 --> 01:47:38,810
A flavor of muscles.

2541
01:47:38,890 --> 01:47:41,080
I saw this picture of a chimp carrying 
fruit.

2542
01:47:41,110 --> 01:47:46,110
It was an old female chimp and she had 
fruit in her hands and fruit and her 

2543
01:47:46,110 --> 01:47:48,280
feet and she's like carryIng these 
things and she's like flexing.

2544
01:47:48,940 --> 01:47:51,190
And I looked at him like,
holy fuck.

2545
01:47:51,250 --> 01:47:56,250
Have you ever seen like a full grown 
male chimpanzee or female chimpanzee 

2546
01:47:56,250 --> 01:47:57,850
full grown?
How big their fucking arms are?

2547
01:47:58,350 --> 01:48:00,250
Holy shit.
That's scary.

2548
01:48:00,550 --> 01:48:05,550
Just muscle gigantic.
Her arms were gigantic and they're that 

2549
01:48:05,550 --> 01:48:10,171
crazy sinewy chimp muscle too,
which is nothing like human muscle to 

2550
01:48:10,420 --> 01:48:15,420
fucking trippy photograph.
When you realized that chimp could just 

2551
01:48:15,420 --> 01:48:15,460
beat the fuck out of you.
Remember that one time?

2552
01:48:15,461 --> 01:48:17,410
She wants it.
That girls face off.

2553
01:48:17,680 --> 01:48:19,600
That was brutal.
Talk about chimps every week.

2554
01:48:19,970 --> 01:48:23,120
My friend went to sturgis motorcycle 
rally.

2555
01:48:23,121 --> 01:48:23,710
Joe.
Yeah.

2556
01:48:23,770 --> 01:48:25,540
The whole time she's there.
Uh,

2557
01:48:25,730 --> 01:48:30,730
I think like four or five people died 
and within like two days and the guys 

2558
01:48:30,730 --> 01:48:31,460
that people at the thing say,
you know,

2559
01:48:31,461 --> 01:48:34,520
this happens every year.
People die like almost every day.

2560
01:48:34,790 --> 01:48:36,450
And the last day she Was there,
uh,

2561
01:48:36,510 --> 01:48:41,510
this guy was doing the,
where they rub up the engines really 

2562
01:48:41,510 --> 01:48:41,960
fast or whatever it's called.
I forget what it's called,

2563
01:48:41,961 --> 01:48:43,730
but it's like they're just revving of 
their engines with us.

2564
01:48:43,910 --> 01:48:47,020
Something happened in his motorcycle,
blew up and he got decapitated.

2565
01:48:47,030 --> 01:48:48,100
Some flew out of his engineering

2566
01:48:48,130 --> 01:48:50,140
capital shit son.

2567
01:48:50,900 --> 01:48:53,000
I'm thinking this is how dangerous 
motorcycles are.

2568
01:48:53,001 --> 01:48:55,580
Fucking how many people die at this 
motorcycle thing.

2569
01:48:55,581 --> 01:48:57,740
But yet there was a car show for 
everyday,

2570
01:48:57,800 --> 01:49:00,220
for the last 50 years in burbank.
And no one's ever done it.

2571
01:49:00,570 --> 01:49:03,710
The thing about those motorcycle shows 
is that a lot of those dudes,

2572
01:49:03,740 --> 01:49:05,650
they get crazy and they want to show off
for each other.

2573
01:49:05,780 --> 01:49:07,880
Start they start standing on their 
bikes.

2574
01:49:07,910 --> 01:49:09,650
Ever seen guys surf with their 
motorcycle?

2575
01:49:09,740 --> 01:49:11,570
Yeah.
There was this old dude was a motorcycle

2576
01:49:11,571 --> 01:49:12,440
maker.
I forget his name.

2577
01:49:12,441 --> 01:49:15,230
He's a famous guy,
but he was famous for being able to ride

2578
01:49:15,231 --> 01:49:16,670
his motorcycle,
like a surf board.

2579
01:49:16,790 --> 01:49:21,790
So you'd get that bitch on the highway 
level that goes out and then stand on 

2580
01:49:21,790 --> 01:49:23,060
top of it.
And he was standing there and if he fell

2581
01:49:23,920 --> 01:49:27,080
he fell.
And that's a wrap son that called ghost.

2582
01:49:27,440 --> 01:49:28,720
What you get when you're doing that?
Well,

2583
01:49:28,730 --> 01:49:31,430
no helmet to.
Oh no helmet.

2584
01:49:31,490 --> 01:49:33,440
Excuse me.
So stupid.

2585
01:49:33,470 --> 01:49:35,960
So he's just living out there on the 
edge and they just lost it.

2586
01:49:35,961 --> 01:49:37,310
And maybe that's the way you wanted to 
go,

2587
01:49:37,370 --> 01:49:38,060
you know,
who knows?

2588
01:49:38,390 --> 01:49:40,980
I mean and everybody kind like recognize
it.

2589
01:49:41,120 --> 01:49:42,650
People didn't make fun of them and say,
oh,

2590
01:49:42,651 --> 01:49:44,150
you fucking idiot.
That's what you deserved.

2591
01:49:44,420 --> 01:49:45,080
Everybody said,
hey,

2592
01:49:45,081 --> 01:49:47,530
died doing what he loved,
I guess.

2593
01:49:47,531 --> 01:49:47,940
Okay.

2594
01:49:48,260 --> 01:49:48,640
I mean,
what,

2595
01:49:48,641 --> 01:49:51,220
you know really realistically,
what are you going to live forever?

2596
01:49:51,390 --> 01:49:56,200
I think there's this news cycles that 
looked like snowmobiles are crazy.

2597
01:49:56,210 --> 01:49:58,630
Look one in the rear and two in the 
front.

2598
01:49:58,660 --> 01:50:00,070
Is that what it is?
Yeah.

2599
01:50:00,130 --> 01:50:00,820
Something like that.
Yeah.

2600
01:50:00,821 --> 01:50:05,821
Yeah.
It's so weird looking and it looks like 

2601
01:50:05,821 --> 01:50:05,821
a snowmobile.
I've seen that.

2602
01:50:05,821 --> 01:50:05,880
It's supposed to be wicked fast.
Yeah.

2603
01:50:06,540 --> 01:50:07,630
Yeah.
Can you see that ariel?

2604
01:50:07,631 --> 01:50:08,860
Adam,
you've ever seen that thing?

2605
01:50:09,400 --> 01:50:10,870
It's like a car.
You ever seen it.
