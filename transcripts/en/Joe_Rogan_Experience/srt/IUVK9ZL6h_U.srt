Oh and it o n n I t put in my name Joe

16
00:00:42,111 --> 00:00:44,090
Just put.
Rogan says,

17
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:49,210
listen to this dude,
I don't really know what the fuck I'm 

18
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:49,210
saying.
You forgot to take Alpha brain today.

19
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:49,220
Didn't you know the three of them right 
before the show?

20
00:00:49,221 --> 00:00:51,360
They just haven't kicked in yet.
I wonder now,

21
00:00:51,361 --> 00:00:53,720
we just,
we just smoked way too much weed.

22
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:56,960
Here we go.
The Joe Rogan experience.

23
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:09,290
We just mixed a bunch of Shit,
man.

24
00:01:09,291 --> 00:01:13,220
We mixed some shit called moon rocks and
with some other stuff.

25
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:18,260
Was Moon rock sativa or was that also.
There's an Oji indigo Jesus.

26
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:23,330
A deep couch lock weed.
And then we mixed it in with that other 

27
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:23,330
stuff.
No,

28
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:24,120
no.
Susko Hannah today.

29
00:01:24,121 --> 00:01:26,880
You brought up the big.
I had to get around.

30
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:32,090
We didn't bring out that orange where 
that blueberry orange from 2005 and not 

31
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:32,680
fucking right.
I got it right away.

32
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,480
It was the best shit back in 2005.
It was,

33
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:43,130
it was before train wreck when I first 
started buying weed before we had a,

34
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,440
um,
before we had licenses,

35
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:50,620
I would always buy mass quantities 
because I didn't want to have to deal 

36
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:51,830
with those dudes,
but I always had just laying around.

37
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:53,810
Dude,
it was incredible.

38
00:01:55,070 --> 00:02:00,070
It's a funny subject.
This marijuana and there's a lot of 

39
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:02,030
controversy behind it and I'm not given 
in.

40
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:05,240
I'm tired of it.
It's a stupid topic.

41
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:08,640
It's a bunch of people.
For whatever reason,

42
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:13,690
care about what other people are doing 
and is always the same tired ass fucking

43
00:02:15,021 --> 00:02:20,021
argument about what about children.
You're setting an example to the 

44
00:02:20,021 --> 00:02:20,660
children to what?
To what?

45
00:02:20,661 --> 00:02:23,720
To eventually be a person who's an adult
who enjoys marijuana.

46
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:26,990
That's life.
That is real life.

47
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:30,750
Like why are we have to pretend that 
that's that to hide that and you,

48
00:02:30,751 --> 00:02:35,751
you parent your fucking kids and don't 
let them do anything until they're in 

49
00:02:35,751 --> 00:02:38,531
their twenties.
I don't think kids should be getting 

50
00:02:38,531 --> 00:02:38,531
drunk.
I think you barely can keep your fucking

51
00:02:38,531 --> 00:02:41,480
shit together as a teenager,
as it is emotionally,

52
00:02:41,481 --> 00:02:43,780
psychologically to get drunk on top of 
that.

53
00:02:43,781 --> 00:02:44,570
I mean,
I did it.

54
00:02:44,571 --> 00:02:46,910
I know you did it,
but it's a terrible idea.

55
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:48,770
If I was going to be honest with my 
kids,

56
00:02:48,771 --> 00:02:50,240
I would say don't get drunk,
don't get high,

57
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,490
don't do shit while you're developing.
Beat.

58
00:02:52,491 --> 00:02:53,990
Become uh,
a man first.

59
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:54,720
You know,
I,

60
00:02:55,100 --> 00:03:00,100
people ask me why I'm so vocal about it 
and the reason I'm about it is

61
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:05,130
because I can get thrown in jail for it.
So I'm going to be vocal about it until 

62
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:08,080
there's absolutely no possibility that I
can get thrown in jail.

63
00:03:08,081 --> 00:03:11,350
And this is for the kids too.
I'm fucking making a stand here.

64
00:03:11,351 --> 00:03:13,030
You are making a stand here in the 
future.

65
00:03:13,031 --> 00:03:14,950
By the time the kids are 18,
19,

66
00:03:14,951 --> 00:03:16,600
20.
Hopefully it will be legal.

67
00:03:16,601 --> 00:03:19,910
So we're doing this for the kids.
But you know,

68
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,480
I'm a big fan of Coca Cola.
I love coke,

69
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:27,540
but I never talk about it.
But if it was illegal it was illegal to 

70
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:27,980
drink soda and you can get thrown in 
jail for it.

71
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:29,920
I'd be talking about it every goddamned.
I'm like,

72
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:33,280
I'm drinking this fucking soda.
I'd be videotaping me drinking soda.

73
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:36,220
It's okay.
Why are we being thrown in jail?

74
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,170
Look,
I'm a productive guy drinking coke.

75
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:39,670
But you know what?
It's legal.

76
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:44,820
I'm not talking about it.
And when weed is legal 100 percent all 

77
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:45,220
the way through,
I'm gonna.

78
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,990
Shut the fuck up about it.
Watch.

79
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,140
I'm not going to shut up about it.
I,

80
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:57,160
I.
It's a positive thing and that's what 

81
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:57,520
people aren't willing to accept.
So many people want to think that it's a

82
00:03:57,521 --> 00:04:02,521
negative,
it just shows a negative image or it 

83
00:04:02,521 --> 00:04:04,150
sends a negative message that you need 
something to get through your life with,

84
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:06,910
and that's not what anybody is saying.
You don't need it.

85
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:08,920
You don't need it,
but it's good.

86
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:10,050
It's that sense.

87
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:13,170
It's the wonder drug for me,
like instead of taking tylenol off,

88
00:04:13,171 --> 00:04:18,171
smoke some weed,
instead of doing this weed is so safe 

89
00:04:18,171 --> 00:04:21,810
that if you smoke too much,
you might call the cops on yourself.

90
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:23,310
You're not going to call the cops on 
yourself.

91
00:04:23,311 --> 00:04:25,190
If you do a lot of heroin or you get too
drunk,

92
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:28,440
imagine getting too drunk and you're 
calling the cops on yourself on weed.

93
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:30,450
You'll call the cops on yourself 
sometimes,

94
00:04:30,451 --> 00:04:30,610
you know?

95
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:36,240
Yeah.
Weed is the safest of all of them and 

96
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:36,250
it's the most introspective evolve them.
You know,

97
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,020
alcohol doesn't make an introspective.
It makes you an asshole,

98
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:42,470
but weed makes you like sensitive about 
the things that you're saying.

99
00:04:42,471 --> 00:04:46,160
It makes you more aware of when you're 
being socially awkward.

100
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:48,110
You know,
you feel the sting of,

101
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:50,300
you know,
weird shit coming out of your mouth.

102
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:52,790
Whereas when you're drunk,
you don't give a fuck,

103
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:55,250
it just comes back.
It just pours out.

104
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:56,110
You know?
It's,

105
00:04:56,170 --> 00:05:01,170
it's an amazing thing that so many 
people believe different and yeah,

106
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:04,070
it could fuck up your life.
There's people that didn't smoke pot and

107
00:05:04,071 --> 00:05:05,930
become losers,
but guess what?

108
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,200
They would have been losers anyway.
That's really what it is.

109
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:14,290
And it's like what you're saying is the 
lazy people with no ambition who aren't 

110
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:15,410
that bright pop gets a hold of them.

111
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:17,360
It's gonna make it's gonna fuck up their
life.

112
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,490
Well guess what?
Their life has already fucked up.

113
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:24,670
If you let you know you,
you come to certain roadblocks or 

114
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:28,961
certain things in your life where you 
have to sort of make decisions about 

115
00:05:28,961 --> 00:05:32,771
your behavior,
where you sort of have to reassess 

116
00:05:32,771 --> 00:05:34,691
yourself.
And if you can't get through the weed 

117
00:05:34,691 --> 00:05:38,040
hurdle,
really how the fuck are you going to 

118
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,560
deal with the real world if you can't 
get through the hurdle of weed?

119
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:44,150
Because weed to me is the truth.
That's what it is when I smoke pot.

120
00:05:44,151 --> 00:05:46,590
Yeah,
I can say a lot of silly shit and I know

121
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:48,770
you get weird and started talking about 
the universe,

122
00:05:48,771 --> 00:05:52,820
but what it is to me is the truth.
Anything that's bullshit,

123
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,000
anything that's a lie.
Anything that's blatantly misleading 

124
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,220
when you're high

125
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:02,420
is just glaring,
like acting is glaring.

126
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,970
If you go to see a movie high and 
they're bad actors,

127
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:10,120
it's gold layering.
If you watch a political speech when 

128
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:10,580
you're high,
it's glaring.

129
00:06:10,581 --> 00:06:15,050
You feel the bullshit where you like,
what the fuck am I listening to?

130
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:19,790
It's offensive to you.
People have the wrong impression,

131
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:21,450
man,
and it's.

132
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,720
It's a shame.
It really is a shame.

133
00:06:23,721 --> 00:06:26,510
It's not that everyone should do it.
You don't have to do it,

134
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:31,810
but you shouldn't be upset if someone's 
telling you an honest interpretation of 

135
00:06:31,821 --> 00:06:35,240
the positive experiences they have on it
and people will go,

136
00:06:35,241 --> 00:06:35,900
well,
you know,

137
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,450
what do you always have to talk about?
It's fucking annoying.

138
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:43,570
Oh,
you guys ever fucking talk about his 

139
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:44,180
week because there's still people out 
there that are arguing against it.

140
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:46,790
There's still people out there that 
don't get it.

141
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:52,210
It's a personal choice issue.
You're a human being and it's the most 

142
00:06:52,401 --> 00:06:56,870
Republican of all ideas.
Stay the fuck out of my private life.

143
00:06:57,110 --> 00:07:00,150
Stay the fuck out of my personal life.
Don't get,

144
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,120
let government get too big.
Well,

145
00:07:02,121 --> 00:07:07,121
this is exactly what this is.
This is only something that's being 

146
00:07:07,121 --> 00:07:10,210
pushed into illegality by gigantic 
corporations is the only way in this day

147
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:14,300
and age that it would still be illegal.
There's,

148
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:17,960
there's resistance because people are 
making money with it being illegal.

149
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:19,010
It's that simple.

150
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:20,950
And when you look,
you look at the,

151
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:24,910
like the movie reefer madness.
It was made back in the thirties.

152
00:07:24,911 --> 00:07:29,911
It was produced by the government.
And if you look at that and you see 

153
00:07:29,911 --> 00:07:32,470
where it all came from and all came,
that was the beginning

154
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:35,430
was actually made by alcohol companies 
in the beginning,

155
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:36,690
in the beginning.

156
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,410
Um,
they,

157
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:43,440
they,
they try to scare everybody by saying 

158
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,310
that we'd major kill and major crazy.
You'll jump out of windows.

159
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,010
You'll kill people.
They made lots of movies.

160
00:07:48,011 --> 00:07:49,930
They made a whole bunch of them in the 
thirties.

161
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:54,220
That was the reefer madness propaganda.
It worked.

162
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:57,280
Any negative negative thought you have 
about weed,

163
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:01,210
it stems from that propaganda from the 
thirties.

164
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:03,820
There's,
it's not a conspiracy theory.

165
00:08:03,821 --> 00:08:07,000
There's many movies out there that you 
could watch.

166
00:08:07,001 --> 00:08:10,090
You could watch them on youtube.
That's where it started.

167
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:12,350
The reason why they don't say that,
you know,

168
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:17,420
you go crazy and you jump out of windows
and you kill people and all that shit 

169
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:20,431
anymore is because people got hip to it.
They believed in the thirties and the 

170
00:08:20,431 --> 00:08:20,431
forties.
But then,

171
00:08:20,431 --> 00:08:20,440
you know,
people were,

172
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:22,270
were smoking weed in the fifties and 
sixties.

173
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:23,860
They were like,
it's not making me crazy.

174
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:28,860
This is actually pretty cool.
So they had to change their stance 

175
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:31,321
slowly.
It evolved from weed kills you to weed 

176
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:33,880
makes you worthless,
you know,

177
00:08:33,881 --> 00:08:35,180
that's,
that's all because you know,

178
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:40,200
they have a lot of examples because 
there are a lot of potheads who are 

179
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:40,200
worthless,
but they're just worthless people.

180
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,190
You know what I mean?
So they just focus on that.

181
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:46,150
Any negative thought you have for weed 
and marijuana?

182
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:49,150
It's because you.
We've all been brainwashed.

183
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:53,950
I used to be the biggest weed hater ever
until I was 28 my whole life.

184
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,150
I couldn't stand potheads.
They made me sick.

185
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:02,360
I was just like,
all those guys on the underground were 

186
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:02,360
writing all that shit.
I would have been doing that.

187
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,080
I would have been doing the same fucking
thing.

188
00:09:04,081 --> 00:09:09,081
I was annoyed.
Every band I was in had one or two 

189
00:09:09,081 --> 00:09:09,360
potheads they fuck up on stage or they 
fuck up rehearsing.

190
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:10,980
I would blame the wheat.
I go,

191
00:09:10,981 --> 00:09:12,630
dude,
you gotTa fucking high.

192
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:15,150
You fucking smoking weed.
You can't play bass and smoke weed.

193
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:18,930
I was so clueless.
I didn't have any idea because every now

194
00:09:18,931 --> 00:09:21,770
and then I get talked into smoking weed 
in high.

195
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:25,480
There was an high school moment.
There was a moment and when I was 23,

196
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,930
24,
that where I freaked the fuck out.

197
00:09:27,931 --> 00:09:30,440
I got all paranoid and I freaked out and
I hated it.

198
00:09:30,441 --> 00:09:35,441
And Weed.
What happens when you're high is it's 

199
00:09:35,441 --> 00:09:37,930
like a roaring river of information.
It just flooded into your brain.

200
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:40,710
Some people don't want to ride those 
wild rapids.

201
00:09:40,711 --> 00:09:41,310
They're like,
fuck that.

202
00:09:41,311 --> 00:09:43,980
I'll stay in the tent.
Some people like it's wide,

203
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:49,010
ride that wild,
rapid and just absorb that energy and 

204
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:50,010
use it to benefit yourself.
Some people,

205
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:50,940
you know,
when you get paranoid,

206
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:52,530
I still get paranoid every now and then.

207
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:54,750
Every now and then that fucking roaring 
river.

208
00:09:54,751 --> 00:09:56,280
I don't want to do that.
You know what I mean?

209
00:09:56,281 --> 00:09:57,330
I just,
I just want to.

210
00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:02,610
I'm not into it.
So it's all like the paranoia and you 

211
00:10:03,081 --> 00:10:08,081
know,
feeling Irie two opposite ends of the 

212
00:10:08,081 --> 00:10:08,190
spectrum.
It's all up to you with the weed.

213
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:11,070
If you smoke weed,
if you can get paranoid.

214
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:12,690
If you can't handle all that 
information,

215
00:10:12,691 --> 00:10:15,120
you want to suppress a lot of that shit.
Don't get high.

216
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:20,130
You're.
If you've got a lot of crazy stressful 

217
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:20,130
things on your mind,
things that are making you nervous.

218
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:24,261
You got to talk to some people but you 
don't know how to say you might get 

219
00:10:24,261 --> 00:10:24,261
fired from your job or your,
your wife's,

220
00:10:24,261 --> 00:10:28,970
you know,
might be cheating on your whatever 

221
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:29,070
you're thinking about all that shit.
If you smoke weed,

222
00:10:29,071 --> 00:10:30,120
you're gonna.
Focus on that.

223
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:30,580
You know?

224
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:35,600
So I,
I recommend that you start smoking weed 

225
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:35,700
around 28,
30.

226
00:10:35,701 --> 00:10:39,180
I never recommend we do kids.
I never do.

227
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:41,640
I think it's best if you're fully 
developed,

228
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:44,640
you know who you are,
you know what kind of person you are.

229
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:47,670
Especially if you're an artist,
you have a lifetime of art.

230
00:10:47,671 --> 00:10:52,110
And then at 28 you see how your art 
changes every whatever art you do,

231
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:54,590
it'll change.
So you'll appreciate it.

232
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,850
The later you wait.
I would say wait till 30.

233
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,280
Jack Herrera,
the greatest hip activists out there,

234
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:02,250
started smoking weed when he was 35.
He was totally anti.

235
00:11:02,251 --> 00:11:03,570
We'd just like me,
just like Joe.

236
00:11:03,571 --> 00:11:07,770
Joe Hated potheads.
We were all just like you all those guys

237
00:11:07,771 --> 00:11:12,771
that think that are fucking throwing up 
in their mouth right now and they're 

238
00:11:12,771 --> 00:11:13,230
sick of me and joe talking all that.
All those guys,

239
00:11:13,231 --> 00:11:15,280
we were just like,
you smart motherfuckers,

240
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,080
you guys are smart.

241
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:20,250
But that we were brainwashed by the 
motherfucking government.

242
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:22,650
We were brainwashed.
It's really simple.

243
00:11:22,651 --> 00:11:25,830
So you should be happy that we're trying
to tell you the truth.

244
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,740
Don't deny the truth.
We're telling you the truth man.

245
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:31,110
And it's not some crazy alien 
conspiracy.

246
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,490
This is some real shit.
And by the way,

247
00:11:33,491 --> 00:11:37,170
it's only our subjective truth.
If your truth is different than my truth

248
00:11:37,171 --> 00:11:39,400
of you do part and you don't like it,
like Stan hopes,

249
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:41,700
townhome just doesn't like wait.
He doesn't like it.

250
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,620
He doesn't like the feeling,
which is fine,

251
00:11:43,621 --> 00:11:45,540
you know,
no one's forcing you to do it.

252
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:50,900
You know,
the real problem is when people were 

253
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:51,660
upset at other people doing something 
that doesn't affect them,

254
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:53,120
but they get upset at it,
they,

255
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:54,160
they,
they see that

256
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,070
possible potential weakness in 
themselves.

257
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:59,680
And so they lash out at it when they see
it in someone else.

258
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:01,600
I really think that's what it is.
You know,

259
00:12:01,601 --> 00:12:04,070
they're,
they're scared themselves that it's a,

260
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:07,510
it's their future that they could get.
They get hooked on a drug too.

261
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:09,460
And that's how I look at it.

262
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:12,850
It's kind of cool it at talking about 
mushrooms.

263
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,640
Mushrooms was on a cartoon the other day
on a,

264
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:19,750
a family guy like Sunday,
9:00,

265
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:20,950
8:30,
they add,

266
00:12:20,951 --> 00:12:25,951
Brian found a bag of mushrooms and they 
showed the mushrooms that looked like 

267
00:12:25,951 --> 00:12:25,951
the mushrooms and any aid,
um,

268
00:12:25,951 --> 00:12:29,220
and went onto this huge mushroom trip 
and the whole episode was about Brian,

269
00:12:29,221 --> 00:12:31,420
like showrooming,
like the majority of it.

270
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,220
And it was kind of interesting to see 
that,

271
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:36,790
that actually they had that on,
on a regular show on TV.

272
00:12:36,791 --> 00:12:41,791
That was that the first time that,
that may maybe like a primetime show 

273
00:12:41,791 --> 00:12:43,160
actually dealt with mushrooms as well.

274
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:48,270
Simpsons the homer Simpson went into a 
chili cook off and eat.

275
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:50,630
So that was always kind of like,
that was always kind of like,

276
00:12:50,631 --> 00:12:52,040
yeah,
this is like mushrooms,

277
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:53,780
you know,
it wasn't like him eating a mushroom.

278
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:54,360
No.
Was it,

279
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:58,330
it was some sort of psychedelic pepper 
member.

280
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:03,410
And the,
the pepper is made him have these crazy 

281
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:03,410
trips.
It was the most awesome Simpson's ever.

282
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:04,370
Yeah.
So they've done that before.

283
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,450
You would love this.
I mean,

284
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:07,760
it doesn't really look,
make mushrooms look great.

285
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:09,560
Like,
this is not what I see when I,

286
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:10,670
when I share my,
my Sherman's,

287
00:13:10,671 --> 00:13:12,730
but it's definitely fun to watch.
While showrooming,

288
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:13,130
I think

289
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:18,930
there's a new study on mushrooms that 
magic mushrooms make you a better person

290
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:22,530
and it stays with you for awhile.
Like shrugging.

291
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:24,780
So the thing is John Hopkins,
yeah,

292
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:30,250
researchers led by [inaudible] mccleon,
a postdoctoral student at John Hopkins 

293
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:33,880
University analyzed personality data on 
52 participants,

294
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:39,120
average age of 46 years old who had 
participated in the groups earlier 

295
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,991
research on the drug.
These volunteers took siliciden during 

296
00:13:42,991 --> 00:13:46,170
to five two to five sessions at various 
doses under highly controlled conditions

297
00:13:46,181 --> 00:13:51,181
at the hospital.
They were also given personality tests 

298
00:13:51,181 --> 00:13:54,480
before the taking psilocybin and again,
a couple months after each drug session 

299
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:59,520
and then again about a year later.
And so what they're saying is that all 

300
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:02,971
these people have all said that it,
it turns you into a better person that's

301
00:14:04,271 --> 00:14:09,271
there.
It had a positive effect on their 

302
00:14:09,271 --> 00:14:09,271
personality.
Think about,

303
00:14:09,271 --> 00:14:11,380
think about some people went unchanged.
It said,

304
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:12,750
uh,
um,

305
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:15,130
think about

306
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:16,480
the fact that,
you know,

307
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:18,100
a lot of people are saying,
Oh,

308
00:14:18,101 --> 00:14:20,320
you guys are just using the medical 
thing.

309
00:14:20,321 --> 00:14:22,900
Just isn't as an excuse to smoke pot.
Oh,

310
00:14:22,901 --> 00:14:23,890
you guys are,
you know,

311
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:27,190
faking your ailments just to get a 
medical marijuana card.

312
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:30,160
Yes,
we are dumb dumb.

313
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:32,890
We are.
We have to go through the medical thing.

314
00:14:32,891 --> 00:14:37,891
This is the process of making it legal.
Ultimately there won't be a medical 

315
00:14:37,891 --> 00:14:37,950
marijuana,
marijuana.

316
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:40,730
Just going to be really faking it though
I'm not faking it.

317
00:14:40,731 --> 00:14:43,870
I smoke weed for exactly what I tell a 
lot of things.

318
00:14:43,871 --> 00:14:48,871
I'm not saying you,
I'm saying there are a lot of people 

319
00:14:48,871 --> 00:14:48,871
would say that would just fake or 
whatever.

320
00:14:48,871 --> 00:14:50,590
I'm not saying who,
but I'm just saying yes,

321
00:14:50,591 --> 00:14:53,030
we have get through the medical.
It's a baby steps.

322
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,980
Ultimately it won't be medical 
marijuana.

323
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:58,030
It's just going to be adult use because 
now it's not.

324
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:02,840
It's not just,
it's not just a neutral.

325
00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:05,180
It's actually,
it's not like a vitamin.

326
00:15:05,181 --> 00:15:09,140
It's better than a vitamin.
It actually cures diseases.

327
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:12,440
It's better than just a vitamin or a 
protein.

328
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:12,970
I mean,
it,

329
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:13,610
it,
it,

330
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:17,030
it's,
it relieves glaucoma for instance,

331
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,620
and now they're finding so many,
there's so many studies of,

332
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:21,130
of,
uh,

333
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:26,460
you know,
reducing cancerous tumors and all that 

334
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:26,460
shit.
Vitamins don't do this.

335
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:29,240
This is a magic herb with no side 
effects.

336
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:32,090
There's no side effects.
No one's ever died from it.

337
00:15:32,091 --> 00:15:34,160
Why are you so worried about your kids 
doing it?

338
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:36,350
Don't worry about it.
I'm not,

339
00:15:36,351 --> 00:15:37,180
I'm not,
I'm,

340
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,320
I have a son coming and I'm going to 
tell them the truth.

341
00:15:39,321 --> 00:15:44,321
I'm not going to lie to Mama.
Tell him the truth about weed and I'm 

342
00:15:44,321 --> 00:15:45,520
going to tell him that he should not 
smoke until he's 28 to 30.

343
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:50,620
Why would you,
why would you want him to wait so long 

344
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:52,801
now so that he could appreciate it more?
There's a lot of young until I was 15 

345
00:15:52,801 --> 00:15:54,230
and I appreciate the fuck out of every 
time I smoke it.

346
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:56,150
Not everybody,
but there are some people,

347
00:15:56,151 --> 00:15:58,460
and I've mentioned the best examples.
Well,

348
00:15:58,461 --> 00:16:00,160
I would think like the older you get,
I,

349
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:01,340
I,
when I get older,

350
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:06,400
I've noticed I'm more concerned about my
health because your health starts to go 

351
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:06,400
when you're.
You're getting old.

352
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,150
I think if I were to start smoking weed 
when I was 30,

353
00:16:08,151 --> 00:16:10,430
I would even be more freaked out.
You say this,

354
00:16:10,431 --> 00:16:13,250
but yet how do you smoke weed and smoke 
cigarettes at the same time?

355
00:16:13,251 --> 00:16:15,530
Because I got to think that if you don't
do it on the same time,

356
00:16:15,531 --> 00:16:17,720
I had one in each hand and I just go 
from back and forth.

357
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:21,140
I would think that if I was smoking weed
and I was also smoking cigarettes,

358
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:26,530
the fact that I was smoking cigarettes 
would start to freak me out so bad that 

359
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:28,520
I would quit.
I would realize how ridiculous it is and

360
00:16:28,521 --> 00:16:31,250
how crazy and terrible.
We all know it's ridiculous and terrible

361
00:16:31,251 --> 00:16:33,700
and horrible for your body,
but we're also addicted to it.

362
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:38,920
It's like any other.
Why don't you just carry around a 

363
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:38,920
packet,
joints and just smoked joints all day?

364
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:39,800
Because I don't.
I don't.

365
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:43,590
I'm not like Joey Diaz style.
I like to smoke one or two hits and they

366
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:46,130
go do something and then later I'll take
one or two hits.

367
00:16:46,131 --> 00:16:47,990
I'm not like I am as well and this whole
fucking joint.

368
00:16:47,991 --> 00:16:50,390
If you raise your tolerance,
a panel wants to,

369
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,300
you can get to the habit.
I don't like being in a cloud.

370
00:16:53,301 --> 00:16:55,180
We'd instead of.
I don't like being.

371
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:57,220
I don't like being in a cloud.
We'd cloud you mean?

372
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:58,610
Yeah.
Yeah.

373
00:16:58,611 --> 00:17:00,230
You can get definitely getting a weed 
cloud,

374
00:17:00,231 --> 00:17:02,030
especially if you're one of those 
wakened biggers,

375
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:03,320
you know,
he can.

376
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:06,370
My best of your health's not good.
My Point Brian was,

377
00:17:06,371 --> 00:17:11,371
and I wasn't,
I was saying some people that have been 

378
00:17:11,371 --> 00:17:12,040
smoking since they were like 11 or 12 or
whatever.

379
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:17,020
I know some serious artists are super 
creative and uh,

380
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:18,280
they,
they tell me,

381
00:17:18,281 --> 00:17:20,170
I think you're giving them too much 
credit.

382
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:22,120
I mean,
we just chills me out.

383
00:17:22,121 --> 00:17:25,460
They smoke weed all day every day.
Amazing artists like will,

384
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:26,710
they just chills me out.
I go,

385
00:17:26,711 --> 00:17:28,360
Dude,
look at your gallery,

386
00:17:28,361 --> 00:17:33,361
dude.
You're the one of the most creative 

387
00:17:33,361 --> 00:17:33,361
molly's doing sculptures and you don't 
think the weed has.

388
00:17:33,361 --> 00:17:38,160
And it was hard for him to see it 
because he was always artistic and he 

389
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,791
always smoked weed so he couldn't see 
the difference if he weren't a smoked 

390
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:45,391
weed and did all this artistic stuff,
you will still been a great artist I'm 

391
00:17:45,391 --> 00:17:45,490
sure.
But that would have been a difference in

392
00:17:45,491 --> 00:17:50,491
the art if you would have been an artist
until he was 28 and then started is art 

393
00:17:50,491 --> 00:17:51,810
would have definitely changed.

394
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:57,140
And what I'm saying is I would be way 
more concerned about my kid being an 

395
00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:01,820
alcoholic or you know,
getting addicted to coke or something.

396
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,780
Shit.
The people die from,

397
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,160
you know,
again,

398
00:18:05,161 --> 00:18:07,830
I don't want my kids smoking weed at 13 
or 14,

399
00:18:07,831 --> 00:18:12,450
but worst case scenario he does.
He does start smoking weed.

400
00:18:12,451 --> 00:18:14,850
It's not going to be the worst thing.
I'm not going to trip out on it.

401
00:18:14,851 --> 00:18:15,560
I'm like,
all right,

402
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:16,950
fuck dude,
you're smoking weed.

403
00:18:16,951 --> 00:18:17,970
How long have you been smoking?
I go,

404
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:23,450
you know,
I really think you should fucking cool 

405
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:23,450
it or whatever.
But you know,

406
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:24,390
when he's an adult will be smoking weed 
together.

407
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:28,020
Watch,
watch.

408
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:29,630
Are you?
Are we got.

409
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:30,380
We got,
we got,

410
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:33,620
we got someone on the line know who's on
the line.

411
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:37,280
Somebody on the line.
You're going to live.

412
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:40,180
What's up out there?
Why you call him?

413
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:44,380
I just think to not speak to any 
problem.

414
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:46,780
No one knows.
What the fuck are you doing here?

415
00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:50,890
Are you going to get an iphone?
Are you going to get the new one?

416
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:56,040
Dude?
No one knows what the fuck we're doing 

417
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:56,040
this like half a million people and 
maybe 10,000.

418
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:56,770
How do you feel about weed

419
00:18:56,980 --> 00:19:00,980
and I,
I know I've talked to you.

420
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:04,730
You're live on the air.
Why?

421
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:05,570
Why,
why?

422
00:19:05,571 --> 00:19:08,820
Why I'm talking to you.
I'm not joking here.

423
00:19:08,821 --> 00:19:10,450
You chose right here Eddie.
I don't want to.

424
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:15,540
Do you want to just be the podcast?
I even tried to talk some sense for Joe 

425
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:20,460
Hogan.
He's at least I can drop the bad guy.

426
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:21,450
Alright.
Alright.

427
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,320
We're going to have to.
We're going to have to cut you off man.

428
00:19:23,321 --> 00:19:24,340
Joe Doesn't want to talk to you.

429
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,910
You don't want to talk.
You know

430
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:33,310
I'm going to just turn it.
That is the most inside of inside jokes.

431
00:19:33,311 --> 00:19:38,311
That 99 percent of the people listening 
to podcasts will not have any idea what 

432
00:19:38,311 --> 00:19:38,311
the fuck that is.
So

433
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:41,950
apple releases the iphone four s today 
and it's not the five,

434
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:45,160
whichever one's thinking,
but remember the three gs when the three

435
00:19:45,161 --> 00:19:50,161
g went to the three gs and that whisk.
That was a real iphone and I think 

436
00:19:50,161 --> 00:19:53,850
that's what they're doing here.
Like I think there's going to be a five 

437
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:54,310
maybe around June or so,
but this s isn't that bad.

438
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:56,590
The cameras,
you're just taking a wild guess.

439
00:19:56,870 --> 00:20:00,250
Well yeah and that's definitely a guest,
but I mean they did it before,

440
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,690
you know,
like the three gs was not.

441
00:20:01,691 --> 00:20:03,970
It was a mild upgrade.
That's why they never caught it.

442
00:20:03,971 --> 00:20:05,500
The Ford,
the three gs added.

443
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:10,980
What was it?
I don't even remember like a better 

444
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:10,980
camera.
So many rumors about this.

445
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:11,650
It's,
it's,

446
00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:12,910
it's.
I always feel so.

447
00:20:12,911 --> 00:20:17,911
But then again,
my life revolves around fucking being 

448
00:20:17,911 --> 00:20:18,670
really into the next phone that comes 
out.

449
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:19,420
Right?
What?

450
00:20:19,421 --> 00:20:21,760
That new Siri.
There's a new intelligent assistant that

451
00:20:21,761 --> 00:20:22,620
helps you out and they,
they,

452
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:27,621
they did a demo today,
which is a thing that you push and you 

453
00:20:27,621 --> 00:20:27,621
pretty much ask it any question you 
want,

454
00:20:27,621 --> 00:20:30,790
you can be like,
schedule me an appointment at 5:00

455
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:33,340
PM on Friday and then we'll go open up 
your calendar and go,

456
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:36,530
do you want me to schedule this?
And just say yes and then we'll schedule

457
00:20:36,531 --> 00:20:37,210
it.
Or you can go,

458
00:20:37,211 --> 00:20:39,380
what's the weather like in New York?
And be like the weather,

459
00:20:39,381 --> 00:20:44,381
the weather's this and it's like they 
showed a bunch of examples and you can 

460
00:20:44,381 --> 00:20:48,310
see examples on apple.com
or any of the websites that can gadget 

461
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:49,270
Gizmodo,
but it seems legit.

462
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:53,460
You can even say like call Joe,
like the android stuff too.

463
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:56,350
It's called Siri S.
I don't know if that's how it's spelled.

464
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:57,280
It's like an assist.

465
00:20:57,550 --> 00:20:58,750
Yeah.
Yeah.

466
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:03,751
And it's pretty much the first step into
having no interaction with having to 

467
00:21:03,751 --> 00:21:07,891
touch your phone.
So this looks like maybe in five years 

468
00:21:07,891 --> 00:21:09,310
you're going to be texting by voice.
You're going to be calling,

469
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,240
you know,
you're not going to.

470
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:15,670
I would say this is a pretty good step.
I wouldn't say it's 100 percent there 

471
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:15,670
right now.
Like I don't think you're,

472
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:18,490
you're still gonna.
Use your google voice,

473
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:20,730
the Google Google for you,
uh,

474
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,920
use your voice and you say,
you know,

475
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:26,170
10th Planet Jiu Jitsu.
You just use that as a surge boom.

476
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:29,560
And it instantly pulls up all.
I mean it's really accurate,

477
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:32,050
like the way it picks up the things that
you're saying,

478
00:21:32,051 --> 00:21:37,051
it's super.
The thing that they showed today looks 

479
00:21:37,051 --> 00:21:39,870
even more amazing that.
And they also announced something that 

480
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:42,661
we talked about earlier about an idea 
I've had since I was a kid and now they 

481
00:21:42,661 --> 00:21:43,000
have it as a feature on the phone and 
I'm like,

482
00:21:43,001 --> 00:21:44,170
Shit,
should I,

483
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,990
it's they call it,
I forget what it's called,

484
00:21:46,991 --> 00:21:49,210
but mine was called snail mail where it 
was,

485
00:21:49,211 --> 00:21:49,920
where,
I don't know if you remember,

486
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:55,050
you would write an email to this company
and the company would write it out and 

487
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:55,960
hand form and then send it to somebody.

488
00:21:55,960 --> 00:22:00,960
And I originally said I thought of the 
idea because I wanted when my 

489
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,931
grandmother was still alive,
I wanted to be able to email my 

490
00:22:03,931 --> 00:22:03,931
grandmother,
but then have somebody hand write it and

491
00:22:03,931 --> 00:22:08,621
then send it to my grandmother.
Well now they just announced it on this 

492
00:22:08,621 --> 00:22:10,210
new iphone that it's a feature and I 
forget what they call it,

493
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:15,510
but that's one of the new features.
Now it's like it's a real person hand 

494
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:16,150
writes it.
I think it's either a handwriting.

495
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:21,690
I don't know if they do it by person.
I bet it's a printer that looks like 

496
00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:21,690
handwriting.
That's probably what they do.

497
00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:24,070
But that's what the whole thing is.
It's two $99 per letter.

498
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:25,990
But that's kind of funny that,
that,

499
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:31,020
you know,
I should have fucking copyrighted that 

500
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:31,690
alongside Chinese people.
That's all I'm thinking.

501
00:22:31,691 --> 00:22:35,950
I'm thinking the shops sweatshops people
copying people's signatures.

502
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:40,980
Yeah.
That shit would be horrendous if you 

503
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:42,751
found out that that was true.
I can't imagine that there's really a 

504
00:22:42,751 --> 00:22:42,751
business for that.
But yeah,

505
00:22:42,751 --> 00:22:47,431
you did come up with that a long time.
A long time ago and the camera looks 

506
00:22:47,431 --> 00:22:50,551
awesome.
Now they're using a whole new lens 

507
00:22:50,551 --> 00:22:52,351
system,
which is making an eight megapixel and 

508
00:22:52,351 --> 00:22:53,040
hd is 10.
80 p I believe is what they should phone

509
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:55,150
the same phone.
You got to get a new phone,

510
00:22:55,210 --> 00:22:57,900
you got to get a new phone for the 
opera,

511
00:22:58,090 --> 00:22:59,350
for ss,
a new phone.

512
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:04,410
It's got.
It's also got a dual processor now they 

513
00:23:04,410 --> 00:23:04,410
switched to.
They're a five chip,

514
00:23:04,410 --> 00:23:05,440
so now it's supposed supposed to be 
really fast.

515
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:08,200
So yeah,
it is a slight upgrade in some ways like

516
00:23:08,201 --> 00:23:09,760
the screens nine,
any difference,

517
00:23:09,761 --> 00:23:11,560
but there is a lot of stuff under the 
hood.

518
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:16,730
Did they improve upon going from apps 
back to your texting and sometimes 

519
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:20,230
you're just looking at a white screen 
for 20 seconds on your phone?

520
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,020
No,
no,

521
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:22,330
no.
Have you,

522
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,710
have you cracked your friend before?
I got a new phone.

523
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:27,980
I kept dropping on,
going from,

524
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:32,530
going from like twitter to my texting,
going back to the texting.

525
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:38,000
You just got to sit there and it takes 
forever to cancel out the running 

526
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,430
programs.
Do you know how to do that?

527
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,450
No.
Oh,

528
00:23:40,451 --> 00:23:41,680
that's the problem.
Yeah.

529
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:43,540
You got to cancel out.
You're running programs,

530
00:23:43,541 --> 00:23:45,220
it's like a computer,
it's really stupid,

531
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,220
it's a stupid

532
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:48,830
fucking design,
but if you press that home button,

533
00:23:48,831 --> 00:23:52,070
the button on your screen,
you've got to press it twice and when it

534
00:23:52,071 --> 00:23:57,071
does that,
a bunch of icons show up in the bottom 

535
00:23:57,071 --> 00:23:57,620
of the screen and you've got to manually
go through press one of them,

536
00:23:57,621 --> 00:24:00,800
you hold it and it gives you the option 
to delete it and then you go through all

537
00:24:00,801 --> 00:24:05,801
of them,
deleting all of them and all you're 

538
00:24:05,801 --> 00:24:05,801
doing is shutting them off.
It's the stupidest thing ever.

539
00:24:05,801 --> 00:24:08,370
Is one of apple's dumbest clumsy as 
fuck.

540
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,440
Well,
I don't think you're gonna have to worry

541
00:24:10,441 --> 00:24:15,441
about it too much anymore because this 
process is two times faster now in the 

542
00:24:15,441 --> 00:24:19,311
graphics are seven times,
but still the fact that all these 

543
00:24:19,311 --> 00:24:21,840
applications stay open and running in 
the background is only running the first

544
00:24:21,841 --> 00:24:23,910
four.
They might show all of it running,

545
00:24:23,911 --> 00:24:28,911
but the supposedly none of those other 
programs are running except the first 

546
00:24:28,911 --> 00:24:30,330
four and then that even that,
the cameras,

547
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,310
the camera though,
33 percent more light.

548
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:36,200
Like why isn't it when you shut it off,
it's off because it's,

549
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:41,280
it's called multitasking so you can go 
through it back and forth it and now 

550
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:41,280
it's,
it's,

551
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:45,730
it's so it keeps a program running,
but only supposedly I thought only kept 

552
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:46,950
the first for it might show all the 
other programs,

553
00:24:46,951 --> 00:24:48,770
but it's only actually using the first 
Ford.

554
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,280
That's cool though because I have

555
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:55,310
had to tweet something and somebody sent
me a text and then a copy and the text 

556
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:56,780
and then go right back to tweet and it's
wearing the same page.

557
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:02,080
That's exactly where it was.
Which wouldn't be if I had to close it 

558
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:02,080
and open it.

559
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:02,080
Yeah,
that's huge.

560
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:02,630
That's huge.
Yeah,

561
00:25:02,631 --> 00:25:07,631
that's pretty good.
The problem is going back like you're 

562
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:11,111
gonna have to before you go to texting,
you gonna have to shut off everything 

563
00:25:11,111 --> 00:25:13,991
off.
That's probably even slower than just 

564
00:25:13,991 --> 00:25:13,991
hitting the Teks and waiting for like 20
seconds.

565
00:25:13,991 --> 00:25:16,190
Right?
I mean they need to work on that because

566
00:25:16,191 --> 00:25:18,440
that's a big fucking way.
What would she say?

567
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:19,940
What did you say?
What was that again?

568
00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:23,420
So you got to turn off these programs so
that you don't get that delay going back

569
00:25:23,421 --> 00:25:24,170
to the text.
No,

570
00:25:24,171 --> 00:25:24,440
no,
no,

571
00:25:24,441 --> 00:25:24,850
no,
no,

572
00:25:24,851 --> 00:25:25,250
no.
That's,

573
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:30,460
that's,
that's the process or a thing for the 

574
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:33,011
most part.
I mean you can be running for intensive 

575
00:25:33,011 --> 00:25:35,531
programs.
Like if you had something crazy on like 

576
00:25:35,531 --> 00:25:37,870
ustream broadcaster,
I don't even know if that's an intense 

577
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:37,870
program or a video game that might slow 
it down a lot,

578
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:42,791
but this is two times faster now,
so you probably won't be having that 

579
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:43,520
problem if that is the case of those 
four programs.

580
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:45,050
Very interesting.

581
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:48,010
New phones supposedly has,
it has two antennas,

582
00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:53,370
one antenna that sends one antenna that 
receives instead of it both happening at

583
00:25:53,711 --> 00:25:57,430
the same time.
So like it's supposed to double.

584
00:25:57,580 --> 00:26:00,700
I might not be interpreting it exactly 
correctly,

585
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:03,870
but it's supposed to be able to double 
the downloads.

586
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,230
Yeah.
I don't know about the intensity.

587
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:07,350
I do know that it uses the verizon 
antenna,

588
00:26:07,410 --> 00:26:09,270
but I didn't see.
I'm looking for that right now.

589
00:26:09,271 --> 00:26:10,740
What you're talking about.
That would make sense.

590
00:26:10,741 --> 00:26:12,000
That'd be awesome.
If it had a,

591
00:26:12,001 --> 00:26:12,960
an intended for both.

592
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:18,060
I read about it,
I don't know which one of the websites 

593
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:20,131
or read about it,
but they said they had basically they 

594
00:26:20,131 --> 00:26:22,090
had duplicated four g speeds with a 
three g device or what?

595
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:25,570
Some people consider four g speeds,
you know,

596
00:26:25,571 --> 00:26:27,540
because there's some bunk ass four g 
right?

597
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:30,520
If you get that verizon four g,
that's bad ass man.

598
00:26:30,521 --> 00:26:32,380
I got up one of those.
A laptop cards,

599
00:26:32,381 --> 00:26:35,530
man at the airport.
If you're in a place where it's four G,

600
00:26:35,531 --> 00:26:36,640
it's.
It's amazing.

601
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:39,370
It's like Wifi.
It's like the best Wifi.

602
00:26:39,371 --> 00:26:40,070
It's really good.

603
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:45,180
What I want to know though is is this 
new version and it sounds like what 

604
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:45,180
you're talking about,
this would make sense.

605
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:50,600
Is this new version for verizon?
Are you going to be able to talk and do 

606
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:51,750
data at the same time?
Now the four lte network.

607
00:26:51,751 --> 00:26:52,610
You can do that.
Okay.

608
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:53,970
But this isn't.
But this isn't.

609
00:26:53,971 --> 00:26:56,710
The Lte network is a four g anything 
that's forward.

610
00:26:56,730 --> 00:26:57,810
Right.
So this isn't for GE.

611
00:26:57,811 --> 00:27:02,811
That was one of the big things that that
I think because the network's not ready 

612
00:27:02,811 --> 00:27:03,000
for iphone.
I think you're right.

613
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:03,610
You know,
one,

614
00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:06,350
one thing that I think they need to 
improve upon.

615
00:27:06,351 --> 00:27:11,351
I think if they put like a,
like a headphone ear piece on each side 

616
00:27:12,111 --> 00:27:15,070
where you can like click it off and it's
wireless and you can put it on your,

617
00:27:15,170 --> 00:27:20,170
you know what,
I'm going to click advanced headphones 

618
00:27:20,170 --> 00:27:22,331
with you because so many times I like,
I forget to bring my fucking headphones 

619
00:27:22,331 --> 00:27:22,331
on.
You know how many times I buy headphones

620
00:27:22,331 --> 00:27:25,370
at the God damn airport if they just had
one to like clicked on,

621
00:27:25,371 --> 00:27:27,320
like the corners you can pop it off and 
there's.

622
00:27:27,321 --> 00:27:32,321
And then you lose it and then your 
iphone is everyone's gonna love lost 

623
00:27:32,321 --> 00:27:34,670
that like the first week or whatever,
but some or you know,

624
00:27:34,671 --> 00:27:37,700
you know where you could pull it out and
then there's a wire even though,

625
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,710
because you know what I mean.
And then you pop it back in.

626
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:44,730
Are you talking about headphones for 
listening to the things or talking on 

627
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:45,210
the phone?
Headphones for listening to shit videos.

628
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:47,660
You're not talking about photography.
Well then it would work for that too.

629
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:49,510
Why not?
But I mean,

630
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,260
I never used a headphone and talk on the
phone.

631
00:27:51,261 --> 00:27:52,870
I always hold the phone up to my.
Yeah,

632
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:55,100
but the more I'm reading about 
radiation,

633
00:27:55,101 --> 00:27:57,050
the more reading about cell phone 
radiation,

634
00:27:57,350 --> 00:28:02,350
the more it really has to be thinking.
I'm really starting to think is there 

635
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:03,660
really something to that?
Because the,

636
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:08,680
the what they accept,
like they say what the acceptable range 

637
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,280
of radiation you're allowed to have this
whole time.

638
00:28:10,281 --> 00:28:15,281
The wizards were right talking on 
speakerphone outside is the way to go 

639
00:28:15,281 --> 00:28:15,670
there.
They're concerned about their brother,

640
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:19,380
their radiation product,
lizards.

641
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:21,180
Oh,
that's hilarious.

642
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:24,230
With black dudes who are really 
aggressive,

643
00:28:24,231 --> 00:28:27,230
who talk on the speakerphone on their 
cell phone wizard wizards,

644
00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:29,930
smart wizards,
because they're not getting radiation in

645
00:28:29,931 --> 00:28:30,790
their head.
What is wrong?

646
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:33,640
That's what if those all those people 
that use speakerphone.

647
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:35,890
I'm not saying,
but I'm talking about everybody on my ex

648
00:28:35,891 --> 00:28:40,891
girlfriend does it to all those people 
that use the speakerphone is that 

649
00:28:40,891 --> 00:28:44,851
they're probably thinking of it that 
maybe maybe you know when you get to 

650
00:28:44,851 --> 00:28:48,391
this four g shit too,
now you've got some super potent flying 

651
00:28:48,391 --> 00:28:49,960
through the air.
What is all this shit flying through the

652
00:28:49,961 --> 00:28:50,580
air man?
Where's that?

653
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:50,630
How's it

654
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,520
going?
I mean,

655
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:53,350
how,
how does that interact with ourselves?

656
00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:58,530
The fact that all these different Wifi 
signals and we could put on a like one 

657
00:28:58,530 --> 00:29:01,990
of those infrared goggles,
but you could see everything.

658
00:29:01,991 --> 00:29:06,991
Like you can see the cell phone signal 
and the information coming through if 

659
00:29:06,991 --> 00:29:08,670
you could just be everything.
You know what I mean?

660
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:14,180
We're in a sea of like frequencies.
Who the fuck knows what that actually 

661
00:29:15,041 --> 00:29:17,290
looks like.
Someone knows how it works.

662
00:29:17,291 --> 00:29:19,780
Like who the fuck figured out how that 
cell phone works.

663
00:29:19,781 --> 00:29:22,180
You know what I mean?
Now we're sending video through the air.

664
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:27,930
Someone figured out that there was like 
some tracks that we can put information 

665
00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:32,311
on an Ra and Jesus is magic and when 
you're in a place that has nothing,

666
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:37,450
there's a certain sound to the silence 
like of the mountains.

667
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:42,070
There's a certain sound where it's 
almost like all us isn't

668
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:46,240
really a sound,
but it just a very low frequency that we

669
00:29:46,241 --> 00:29:49,150
can't tune into.
Imagine if it just affects your everyday

670
00:29:49,151 --> 00:29:51,250
consciousness.
You just don't realize it.

671
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:56,400
If your everyday consciousness just 
slightly pressured by all of these 

672
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,310
vibrations that are around you all the 
time,

673
00:29:57,311 --> 00:30:02,311
all these cell phones,
signals and fucking Wifi signals and 

674
00:30:02,311 --> 00:30:06,490
satellite signals and radio signals and 
fuck.

675
00:30:06,491 --> 00:30:09,100
Imagine if that is really fucking with 
our personalities.

676
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:12,040
Imagine if you'd be a different person 
or at least add.

677
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:13,400
Feel different.
Yeah.

678
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:14,710
Add.
Who knows,

679
00:30:14,711 --> 00:30:17,140
who knows how many different things.
Who knows?

680
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:23,190
Oh,
I wonder what all this shit is doing to 

681
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:23,190
us.
It's only been around for a few.

682
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:27,040
You know,
how long it started with TV signals and 

683
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,050
radio signals or radio furs than TV and 
then.

684
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:30,670
And it mean,
but within the last couple decades,

685
00:30:30,850 --> 00:30:35,130
the amount of infiltration in our lives 
by frequencies and

686
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:37,320
walkie talkies.
Man,

687
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:39,820
how the fuck did they forgot walkie 
talkies?

688
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:43,100
You know what I mean?
That's amazing.

689
00:30:43,170 --> 00:30:45,270
A walkie talkies fucking crazy.

690
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:50,470
Well,
they use to be able to send things and 

691
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:52,271
they weren't encoded either.
You'd have to have to manually encode 

692
00:30:52,271 --> 00:30:53,330
their information because they didn't 
want people that were.

693
00:30:53,570 --> 00:30:55,490
The enemy was tuning into their shit 
too.

694
00:30:55,730 --> 00:30:59,450
So everybody had to talk in code.
Wrap your head around that like not only

695
00:30:59,451 --> 00:31:03,290
is there no email but you when you,
when you send some signal out,

696
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:06,350
anybody can get that signal.
So you're in the bottom of the summary.

697
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:07,290
De de,
De,

698
00:31:07,290 --> 00:31:07,600
De,
De,

699
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:07,750
De,
de,

700
00:31:07,751 --> 00:31:08,310
De,
de.

701
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:10,860
The Japanese are listening.
They hear your fucking signal.

702
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,160
You can't,
you can't just send it just to you.

703
00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:16,370
It's crazy like that.
As technology just snowballs.

704
00:31:16,371 --> 00:31:20,630
It's the more access we have that 
instant information,

705
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:22,340
infinite information.
The more,

706
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:25,250
the more free we feel,
the more we can get.

707
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:26,480
Keep track of,
you know,

708
00:31:26,481 --> 00:31:28,290
like the government get they get when 
you want to.

709
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:33,300
CSI Shit.
Every move you make they could just 

710
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:35,660
break it down from your cell phones.
They know what cell phone tower you hit,

711
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:38,090
they know exactly where you were from,
the cell phone towers.

712
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:42,560
They can go back and all the deleted 
messages that you all shit you deleted.

713
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:47,650
They can go back and retrieve them like 
there's some kind of imprint of this 

714
00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:48,230
shit somewhere like,
holy fuck.

715
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:49,310
We think like,
oh,

716
00:31:49,311 --> 00:31:50,930
we're more powerful,
more connected.

717
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:54,080
We're more under control that more than 
anything.

718
00:31:54,081 --> 00:31:55,850
You know,
every little move we make,

719
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:57,020
they,
they know exactly.

720
00:31:57,021 --> 00:32:00,890
If they needed a pinpoint somebody how 
easy it is to fucking find somebody.

721
00:32:00,891 --> 00:32:02,930
You're going to live off the grid.
How long is that going to last?

722
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:05,800
You better go to the Amazon jungle.
You know what I mean?

723
00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:07,610
That's the only place you're going to 
survive.

724
00:32:07,611 --> 00:32:08,270
They'll find you.

725
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:09,210
Well,
it certainly,

726
00:32:09,211 --> 00:32:14,211
it's the connections.
Much more immersive than it's ever been 

727
00:32:14,211 --> 00:32:17,181
before.
There's never been any at any point in 

728
00:32:17,181 --> 00:32:18,660
time where people are so easy to get in 
contact with other people.

729
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:19,720
Yeah,
I know.

730
00:32:20,330 --> 00:32:25,330
Did you,
did you hear about that guy that are 

731
00:32:25,330 --> 00:32:25,330
around your neighborhood?
Uh,

732
00:32:25,330 --> 00:32:28,970
he flew off the,
a side of a cliff and there wasn't cell 

733
00:32:28,970 --> 00:32:29,880
phone service there,
so we couldn't use a cell phone and he,

734
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,180
him and he got in a car accident with 
another person or something like that.

735
00:32:33,181 --> 00:32:34,530
And then both of their cars are down 
there.

736
00:32:34,531 --> 00:32:39,531
The other guy died.
And so his body was like everywhere and 

737
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,100
broke,

738
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:44,780
like every single bone in his body was 
still alive and he tried to crawl out,

739
00:32:44,781 --> 00:32:46,400
but he couldn't move because everything 
was broken.

740
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:51,640
And for 10 days he sat down there with 
his dead guy living off of grass and 

741
00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:54,890
bugs and creek.
There was like a little creek water,

742
00:32:54,891 --> 00:32:56,300
I guess he would,
he would drink,

743
00:32:56,330 --> 00:33:01,330
but for 10 days he lived there.
And then one day his love his son or 

744
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:01,330
something like that was going down the 
road,

745
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:06,131
like looking,
there's still kind of looking for them 

746
00:33:06,131 --> 00:33:08,021
and stuff.
And he hurt his dad's help yell for 

747
00:33:08,021 --> 00:33:08,021
help.
And they found his body,

748
00:33:08,021 --> 00:33:09,620
but he didn't have cell phone service 
there.

749
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:12,290
And if he would have had been able to.
He said he,

750
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:13,640
the whole time was just searching his 
cell phone,

751
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:18,670
his cell phone died and stuff.
But can you imagine 10 days on the 

752
00:33:18,670 --> 00:33:21,410
bottom of a creek and there's not cell 
phone service and it was just all fucked

753
00:33:21,411 --> 00:33:22,580
up.
So we couldn't walk out of there.

754
00:33:22,581 --> 00:33:23,750
Yeah.
But he's alive now and he's,

755
00:33:23,751 --> 00:33:24,550
uh,
he's doing,

756
00:33:24,551 --> 00:33:29,551
he's recovering and everything.
But imagine being 10 days at Brown and 

757
00:33:29,551 --> 00:33:30,850
dead person too.
It's also just think of

758
00:33:30,930 --> 00:33:34,200
a how vulnerable your body is.
And if you body breaks,

759
00:33:34,201 --> 00:33:36,420
you're just stuck.
You can't move,

760
00:33:36,610 --> 00:33:41,610
you know?
I don't think most of us don't wrap our 

761
00:33:41,610 --> 00:33:41,610
heads around that.
Your body breaks,

762
00:33:41,610 --> 00:33:45,230
then you can't move.
And then being out in the woods so you 

763
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:48,111
get to things that scare the fuck out of
people being alone out in the uncharted 

764
00:33:49,170 --> 00:33:50,750
wilderness.
Hearing cars drive

765
00:33:51,210 --> 00:33:56,210
you above you.
Everyday it's on be is just a side of 

766
00:33:56,210 --> 00:33:56,210
the roads,
you know,

767
00:33:56,210 --> 00:33:56,970
in some area that's,
you know,

768
00:33:57,060 --> 00:34:02,060
people drive by every day.
That might as well be uncharted 

769
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:02,060
wilderness.
Nobody goes.

770
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:02,060
Yeah,
they said,

771
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:05,910
they said that people fly off of those 
clips all the time and never get found 

772
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,130
because it's just like,
who goes down there?

773
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:13,160
No one goes down there.
Nobody goes looking to find cars down 

774
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:13,160
there all the time.
Yeah,

775
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:14,070
that's just,
that's a scary thing,

776
00:34:14,071 --> 00:34:19,071
man.
That's the cliff driving ever do the 

777
00:34:19,071 --> 00:34:21,560
Pacific coast,
Pacific coast all the way up to 

778
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:21,560
Monterrey and all the way that.

779
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:21,740
Ooh,
that's scary.

780
00:34:21,770 --> 00:34:23,630
It's beautiful.
Fuck the first time I did it,

781
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:27,600
I was 28 years old and I never took that
drug.

782
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:29,660
I was like,
I live in California,

783
00:34:29,661 --> 00:34:34,661
and I never knew that.
It was one of the most beautiful states 

784
00:34:34,661 --> 00:34:35,990
ever.
Incredible scenery.

785
00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:41,050
It's so cliffs in the rocks.
It's so hard to even wrap your head 

786
00:34:41,050 --> 00:34:41,180
around.
It's magnificent.

787
00:34:41,181 --> 00:34:46,181
I kept pulling over the girl I was with.
We took a little trip for a couple of 

788
00:34:46,181 --> 00:34:46,700
days.
He kept.

789
00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:50,510
I kept pulling over just videotaping.
I couldn't believe this was California.

790
00:34:50,511 --> 00:34:51,800
I'm like,
Holy Shit.

791
00:34:51,801 --> 00:34:54,830
I've never been up to northern 
California before on the east coast.

792
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:56,930
There's a lot of parts of that fucking 
drive.

793
00:34:56,931 --> 00:35:01,931
Were you just counting on the other 
asshole on the other side to just be 

794
00:35:01,931 --> 00:35:01,931
cool?
He'd been together.

795
00:35:01,931 --> 00:35:03,650
Stay in your lane.
Don't be texting.

796
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:06,770
Isn't it crazy how they put a big halt 
to that satellite phone?

797
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:08,720
Remember it was big like six,
seven years ago.

798
00:35:08,721 --> 00:35:09,950
It was like the future,
like,

799
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:15,190
and the commercial was dude was in the 
wilderness on a mountain and he was 

800
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:16,250
making a call like,
this is the best shit,

801
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:18,740
and then boom,
they just shut it all down.

802
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:19,850
No,
they have satellite phones.

803
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,890
They still don't.
How come it didn't blow up?

804
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,720
Oh No,
it's not that efficient.

805
00:35:23,721 --> 00:35:25,400
Yeah.
It wasn't a world phone now,

806
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:26,300
didn't they have,
didn't they?

807
00:35:26,490 --> 00:35:31,490
Didn't,
they shut down the satellite phones 

808
00:35:31,490 --> 00:35:31,490
because of the whole terrorism thing.

809
00:35:31,490 --> 00:35:32,140
I think they briefly shut them down 
around that time period,

810
00:35:32,141 --> 00:35:33,700
but I don't think.
I think they still have,

811
00:35:33,850 --> 00:35:36,550
um,
somebody had a satellite phone the other

812
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:37,820
day or a.

813
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:38,940
Oh wait,
that was last.

814
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:39,980
Nevermind.
I think they,

815
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:42,060
I think they use them on a sort of fear 
factor.

816
00:35:42,830 --> 00:35:47,830
If we used to use them all the time.
We used to have to use satellite phones.

817
00:35:48,991 --> 00:35:50,780
There were certain sets that we'd 
beyond,

818
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,020
but there was nothing.
There was nothing.

819
00:35:52,021 --> 00:35:53,490
You didn't think of it.
That would be huge.

820
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:57,090
I thought I thought they got shut down a
expensive.

821
00:35:57,150 --> 00:35:59,100
I don't think the sound quality's that 
good either.

822
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:02,070
I think that's a big delay is a little 
more,

823
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,710
I shouldn't say a big delay.
It's fucking amazing.

824
00:36:04,711 --> 00:36:09,711
It goes up to the sky and then back down
and that's what reporters should have 

825
00:36:09,711 --> 00:36:12,621
phones that like regular phones with 
like fucking nine g you got the 

826
00:36:12,621 --> 00:36:12,621
satellite.
If you need it,

827
00:36:12,621 --> 00:36:17,361
you just click on the little thing just 
in case like these stories flag off 

828
00:36:17,361 --> 00:36:17,820
cliffs and shed get lost in the woods.

829
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:23,210
You know how many movies have like 
someone getting chased and their cell 

830
00:36:23,210 --> 00:36:26,541
phone signal,
so now it's a good idea because now 

831
00:36:26,541 --> 00:36:29,421
there's the t the chips are slowly 
shrinking to the point where you could 

832
00:36:29,421 --> 00:36:33,501
get all that in in one phone,
but if you ever look at the satellite 

833
00:36:33,501 --> 00:36:33,570
phones,
there's a reason where there's big giant

834
00:36:33,571 --> 00:36:36,000
bricks.
I mean the receiver has to be completely

835
00:36:36,001 --> 00:36:37,650
different than a little tiny one.
Internal.

836
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:40,980
I'm going to be the new pimp floss.
Then it's also nowadays cars.

837
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:46,220
Cars have it built in like my car has a 
feature in it that you can turn on that 

838
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:50,091
if I can in a car accident and 
automatically texts my gps and sends it 

839
00:36:50,091 --> 00:36:50,091
and calls nine.
One one.

840
00:36:50,110 --> 00:36:51,390
Yeah,
for does that right?

841
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:54,570
Saying somebody told me this and I don't
know if it's true.

842
00:36:54,571 --> 00:36:56,960
So twitter people fucking informed me.

843
00:36:57,170 --> 00:37:02,170
Tell me if this is true.
Somebody said that the dude bought a 

844
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:03,450
corvette and it had that.
What is the thing?

845
00:37:03,451 --> 00:37:07,800
The onstar system on star guy was going 
down the highway going 148 miles an hour

846
00:37:07,801 --> 00:37:12,801
or something crazy like that.
Onstar shut off his car now called the 

847
00:37:12,801 --> 00:37:13,500
police.
Now that's not true.

848
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,600
You sure that's not true?
One hundred percent and that's not true.

849
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:20,720
No way that the onstar even is 
monitoring how fast or driving or do 

850
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:21,660
anything.
I thought it saves information.

851
00:37:21,661 --> 00:37:24,960
If you're in a wreck they can find out 
that your data might save it.

852
00:37:24,961 --> 00:37:29,961
But there's so many cars.
I have onstar and the fact that they 

853
00:37:29,961 --> 00:37:29,961
actually have people sitting there will 
go in.

854
00:37:29,961 --> 00:37:30,660
All right,
he's going 120 over here.

855
00:37:30,661 --> 00:37:35,661
You know there's no one monitoring that.
That'd be unless you get in a car 

856
00:37:35,661 --> 00:37:35,661
accident,
maybe it's the program itself.

857
00:37:35,661 --> 00:37:40,550
Maybe onstar itself when it recognizes 
that you hit a certain amount of miles 

858
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:44,480
per hour,
they shut your car off if you don't 

859
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,311
think that's possible.
I know it's possible that they could 

860
00:37:46,311 --> 00:37:46,311
shut it off if someone's driving it.
Right?

861
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:48,840
Can't they shut her off?
What's that called,

862
00:37:48,841 --> 00:37:52,080
Jack Something Jack?
I think I've done that.

863
00:37:52,081 --> 00:37:54,090
The crux of them,
they'd done that to people before.

864
00:37:54,091 --> 00:37:55,260
Shut their cars off while they're 
driving.

865
00:37:55,261 --> 00:37:56,880
It seems like they have.
I don't know,

866
00:37:56,881 --> 00:37:59,060
maybe I'm making this up.
It seems like a car.

867
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:02,130
That was that one reality show where 
people steal cars.

868
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:07,800
That's what I'm thinking.
Like you know the way things are going 

869
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,750
to kill switches,
it looks like,

870
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,130
you know,
I don't know.

871
00:38:11,131 --> 00:38:14,070
I could be wrong,
but it looks like in the future,

872
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:19,250
like it's just going to be mandatory.
It's going to be a law that the CHP or 

873
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:23,331
the police department or whatever the 
fuck they call the forest back then has 

874
00:38:23,331 --> 00:38:26,781
gps on your shit and like the DMV and 
they just monitor every mile you drive,

875
00:38:27,421 --> 00:38:29,370
so anytime you fuck up they just send 
you tickets.

876
00:38:29,371 --> 00:38:31,680
They go,
we have your gps fingerprint.

877
00:38:31,681 --> 00:38:35,070
You manage your gps record.
Can you imagine that shit?

878
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:37,720
Fuck them cameras.
Like in England they got cameras,

879
00:38:37,721 --> 00:38:38,620
they got better.
You know that.

880
00:38:38,621 --> 00:38:40,750
They take pictures,
but they're not going to need that.

881
00:38:40,810 --> 00:38:44,320
The DMV just gonna Monitor your driving 
every day you'll have a sheet.

882
00:38:44,410 --> 00:38:45,190
Oh,
he broke.

883
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:46,600
You know there's a ticket.
Here's a ticket.

884
00:38:46,601 --> 00:38:48,550
Boom.
No more hiding.

885
00:38:49,330 --> 00:38:50,230
No more speeding.

886
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:57,400
You have to go to a track if you want to
go fast than spots like that and we 

887
00:38:57,401 --> 00:38:59,530
can't.
Sometimes speed limits.

888
00:38:59,531 --> 00:39:02,210
Ridiculous.
For the most part,

889
00:39:02,211 --> 00:39:04,570
it's speed limits.
Probably pretty smart to have a,

890
00:39:05,290 --> 00:39:10,290
a decent number set and a lot of places,
but there's a lot of places where it's 

891
00:39:10,290 --> 00:39:11,860
silly like the highway,
the fuck out of here.

892
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:15,340
Will you see 55 miles an hour,
get the fuck outta here.

893
00:39:15,790 --> 00:39:18,130
That's stupid.
That's a stupid way to move.

894
00:39:18,490 --> 00:39:19,670
Fifty five miles an hour.
How?

895
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:24,750
What kind of car do you have?
Maybe if you're a fucking old jalopy 

896
00:39:24,750 --> 00:39:27,511
back when they instituted that speed 
limit and it made sense because if 

897
00:39:27,511 --> 00:39:29,470
you're going more than 55 miles an hour 
and old fucking Chevy Nova,

898
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:34,210
one of those six cylinder shit boxes,
you know those break suck dude.

899
00:39:34,370 --> 00:39:36,940
You know if you're actually going fast 
and one of those cars.

900
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:39,010
I mean they're awesome cars when people 
rebuild them,

901
00:39:39,011 --> 00:39:44,011
don't get me wrong,
but I mean in compared to today's 

902
00:39:44,011 --> 00:39:44,011
technology,
the technology,

903
00:39:44,011 --> 00:39:48,541
those cars,
they couldn't handle well and they 

904
00:39:48,541 --> 00:39:50,131
couldn't break well.
I haven't had that much where you're 

905
00:39:50,131 --> 00:39:52,060
breaking the car,
slamming on the brakes.

906
00:39:52,061 --> 00:39:53,190
That's scary.
That's a common.

907
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:54,850
That's why.
That's why we need to move to Texas.

908
00:39:54,851 --> 00:39:57,850
I heard that they now have their voting 
to get the speed limit.

909
00:39:57,851 --> 00:40:00,100
Moved to 90 I think is what they were 
saying.

910
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:05,820
Maybe it was 80,
but there's a lot of parts of Texas I 

911
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:05,820
fucking love.
Oh,

912
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:06,820
speaking of which,
I'm in Texas this weekend.

913
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:09,970
Powerful Verizon Center this Friday 
night,

914
00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:13,390
and you haven't been to Houston so long,
you still use the own Houston every time

915
00:40:13,391 --> 00:40:16,480
you went into town you would sell me.
No,

916
00:40:16,481 --> 00:40:21,481
I know,
but you would sell out every single 

917
00:40:21,481 --> 00:40:22,981
show.
That was the biggest market and then 

918
00:40:22,981 --> 00:40:22,981
they closed the comedy club that we love
to go to.

919
00:40:22,981 --> 00:40:25,270
I went to the second member of boy in 
Houston,

920
00:40:26,110 --> 00:40:28,480
I'd want to say his name,
but I remember a boy in Houston.

921
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:32,410
He came out on the road with us.
Um,

922
00:40:32,470 --> 00:40:37,470
red devil when he was in red.
Classic.

923
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:45,600
He never came on the road with us.
We were always going on the subject and 

924
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:45,600
no one's going to know what the fuck I'm
talking about.

925
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:47,130
Yeah,
that's why you explain it.

926
00:40:47,350 --> 00:40:49,590
There's a mic.
We got three hours but you otherwise.

927
00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:53,770
But this place just about Toyota Toyota 
Center or Verizon Center.

928
00:40:53,771 --> 00:40:56,240
I can't remember where the standup is.
Yeah,

929
00:40:57,240 --> 00:41:02,240
yeah.
You were on a radio station there the 

930
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:02,240
other day and he said that radio was 
pretty ridiculous.

931
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:02,470
Like,
yeah,

932
00:41:02,830 --> 00:41:03,850
they were nice.
They were cool.

933
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:07,780
They played that a supernanny song.
They play your song all the time.

934
00:41:07,990 --> 00:41:09,400
Yeah.
He was just quoting a bet that I did.

935
00:41:09,401 --> 00:41:10,210
I was like,
what are you talking about?

936
00:41:10,210 --> 00:41:15,210
I don't even know that bit,
but now after I got off the phone with 

937
00:41:15,210 --> 00:41:15,210
them I was like,
damn,

938
00:41:15,210 --> 00:41:18,301
I think he was right.
I think that is a line in one of my old 

939
00:41:18,301 --> 00:41:18,970
bits that I forgot because he was 
talking something about toe ring.

940
00:41:18,971 --> 00:41:20,470
I'm like,
have a jug about a toe ring.

941
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:21,830
And he goes,
you could do.

942
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,320
And I'm like,
are you high or drunk?

943
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:28,500
I don't remember a joke about a tour.
I think it's like a line in one of my 

944
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:28,500
old old jokes,
you know,

945
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:33,200
if you play like I've played back my 
shit from like 1999 and it almost as if 

946
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,040
like it's someone else's

947
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:36,620
material.
I don't even know it anymore,

948
00:41:36,890 --> 00:41:38,090
you know?
I mean I remember it.

949
00:41:38,091 --> 00:41:39,200
Yeah.
That was one of my jokes,

950
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:42,380
but I don't even know them anymore.
So if like somebody quotes like a little

951
00:41:42,381 --> 00:41:47,381
piece of it,
I might not even know what the fuck 

952
00:41:47,381 --> 00:41:47,810
they're talking about.
It seems so weird for something that for

953
00:41:47,811 --> 00:41:52,811
years you're so intimately connected to,
but when you have material and then you 

954
00:41:52,811 --> 00:41:53,300
abandoned it and start on some new 
material,

955
00:41:53,301 --> 00:41:57,450
you fucking forget every did when you 
started smoking weed was at 30 to 30,

956
00:41:57,890 --> 00:42:02,890
31 and 30.
He went from like pure Dick Jokes and 

957
00:42:02,890 --> 00:42:06,280
relationship jokes and chick jokes and 
cock blocking jokes and then right into 

958
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:07,940
your pyramid bit.
You started smoking.

959
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:11,570
When did the paramed bid people?
Dumb people.

960
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:16,630
People out.
Fucking smart people and a staggering 

961
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:17,120
pace.
Why doritos are so funny and wacky.

962
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:20,510
Yeah,
it changed my comedy for sure.

963
00:42:20,650 --> 00:42:25,640
We'd made a complete turn in my comedy.
You know,

964
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:29,630
it's like I just Kinda,
I learned to see things differently.

965
00:42:29,810 --> 00:42:34,810
You know,
you got some good classics before we'd 

966
00:42:34,810 --> 00:42:34,810
done for sure fucking time.
Nicole Smith the tiger.

967
00:42:34,810 --> 00:42:39,551
But how many times have I been on the 
road and I just wanted to hear the 

968
00:42:39,551 --> 00:42:39,551
title.
I've heard a thousand times.

969
00:42:39,551 --> 00:42:41,450
I'm always like,
you know,

970
00:42:41,451 --> 00:42:43,610
like shut up motherfucker.
That was one of those bits.

971
00:42:43,611 --> 00:42:47,120
It was so hard to let go.
I love tiger with the ultimate bit.

972
00:42:47,121 --> 00:42:49,430
Now I'll never get tired of that one.
I had to let it go though.

973
00:42:49,850 --> 00:42:50,910
Whenever you have a,
you know,

974
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:55,920
you got new material.
You can't keep remembering the old 

975
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:58,541
material.
I really don't remember exactly how can 

976
00:42:58,541 --> 00:43:00,551
I get a tiger sound just to give me a 
little fucking so real roar.

977
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:12,220
That was on the fair.
I can't remember.

978
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,400
You had a better job too.
What was that?

979
00:43:16,430 --> 00:43:18,500
Remember when the bear attack,
the karate trainer.

980
00:43:18,710 --> 00:43:23,710
There was a.
That was the guy who was a trainer and 

981
00:43:23,710 --> 00:43:26,651
he's dressed in a karate outfit and he 
had a lady come onstage to them and the 

982
00:43:26,651 --> 00:43:29,951
lady sat in the chair and the bear 
turned and looked at the lady and just 

983
00:43:29,951 --> 00:43:31,550
started fucking her up.
Just started fucking her up,

984
00:43:31,790 --> 00:43:36,790
but it was just like the bear just woke 
up and realized I'm a fucking bear and 

985
00:43:36,790 --> 00:43:40,760
then it just starts wailing like out of 
nowhere to dude that a karate outfit.

986
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:43,580
He was trying to protect the guy on 
youtube.

987
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:46,160
That was way before you go debt.
No,

988
00:43:46,170 --> 00:43:46,430
no,
no,

989
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:47,430
no.
That's the story.

990
00:43:47,450 --> 00:43:48,710
Actual store video.
Yeah.

991
00:43:48,711 --> 00:43:51,400
I bet that.
I bet somebody put it online down.

992
00:43:51,590 --> 00:43:53,690
I would like to see because I heard so 
much youtube.

993
00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:58,780
I heard that joke so much is crazy.
Never actually seen the real footage of 

994
00:43:58,780 --> 00:44:03,401
air.
Just turns this lady and starts fucking 

995
00:44:03,401 --> 00:44:03,401
her up for no reason.
She sat down.

996
00:44:03,401 --> 00:44:04,850
That's the weirdest thing about animals,
man.

997
00:44:04,851 --> 00:44:07,310
Sometimes you don't realize,
but like,

998
00:44:07,370 --> 00:44:10,580
like trained animals,
like sometimes they're just tweaked like

999
00:44:10,581 --> 00:44:12,410
they're tired of this.
They don't want to do this anymore.

1000
00:44:12,411 --> 00:44:17,411
This is stupid.
I don't want to be led around why you 

1001
00:44:17,411 --> 00:44:17,411
fucking with me?
What's going on here?

1002
00:44:17,411 --> 00:44:22,150
And then it looks normal because they do
it every day and they don't know how to 

1003
00:44:22,150 --> 00:44:25,571
communicate,
but they're a little tweet and so they 

1004
00:44:25,571 --> 00:44:29,021
sit down and the fucking lady sits right
now next to him and he just decided to 

1005
00:44:29,021 --> 00:44:30,560
fuck her up out of nowhere.
And it looks like it's out of nowhere,

1006
00:44:30,770 --> 00:44:35,770
but it's been built up all day because 
you got this fucking stupid bear doing 

1007
00:44:35,770 --> 00:44:35,770
somersaults.

1008
00:44:35,910 --> 00:44:37,050
You know,
you've got this bear,

1009
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:42,380
you know,
instead of killing deers in eat and 

1010
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:43,470
berries and shit,
this bears running around on chairs.

1011
00:44:43,590 --> 00:44:46,060
You know,
playing musical chairs are porter,

1012
00:44:46,770 --> 00:44:47,910
what the fuck are you doing,
man?

1013
00:44:47,911 --> 00:44:48,930
That's a.
that's a big,

1014
00:44:48,931 --> 00:44:53,931
crazy unpredictable animal.
There's a video of a dude who is 

1015
00:44:53,931 --> 00:44:54,720
training a bear and he was training 
with,

1016
00:44:54,810 --> 00:44:57,120
I believe it was his brother or his 
cousin,

1017
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:59,520
someone who is a close family member,
I think it was his brother,

1018
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:04,820
and the bear just turns on the guy for 
no reason and rips his throat out.

1019
00:45:05,550 --> 00:45:08,610
It happens in 30,
not even 30 seconds,

1020
00:45:08,730 --> 00:45:12,210
10 seconds,
maybe a maximum for no reason.

1021
00:45:12,570 --> 00:45:15,720
They're all had this bear in this room.
The bed just turns on.

1022
00:45:15,721 --> 00:45:20,721
The guy goes right at his neck and rips 
it out and the guy bled out and died 

1023
00:45:20,721 --> 00:45:22,170
right there.
Isn't it crazy that some when when these

1024
00:45:22,171 --> 00:45:24,060
trained animals,
a lot of them,

1025
00:45:24,061 --> 00:45:29,061
when they attack,
they don't kill him because it's like 

1026
00:45:29,061 --> 00:45:29,100
they give them another chance.

1027
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:34,100
They might like the killer whale.
Didn't they get that killer whale like 

1028
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:34,320
band this bear?
They didn't kill this bear.

1029
00:45:34,490 --> 00:45:37,680
It's a why.
It just seems like it's costs more money

1030
00:45:37,681 --> 00:45:40,770
to retrain another bear than to pay the 
insurance policy on.

1031
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,210
You know what I mean?
It's gotTa.

1032
00:45:42,730 --> 00:45:44,640
It's gotta be what it is.
I don't get it.

1033
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:46,470
You know,
I don't get it.

1034
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:51,620
I don't get it.
I don't understand how anybody can 

1035
00:45:51,620 --> 00:45:51,620
convince anybody that had a bear that 
wants,

1036
00:45:51,620 --> 00:45:55,200
that has already killed a person who 
offered no threat whatsoever.

1037
00:45:55,350 --> 00:45:57,540
That thing,
if a person did that,

1038
00:45:57,541 --> 00:46:02,541
you would kill them.
You give them the death penalty in a 

1039
00:46:02,541 --> 00:46:03,750
right society.
If you saw someone run up to someone for

1040
00:46:03,751 --> 00:46:06,150
no reason to rip your throat out,
you would kill them.

1041
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:11,300
Why the fuck would you give a bear more 
rights and you'd give up maybe not 

1042
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:12,690
killed a bear because I don't blame the 
bear for doing that.

1043
00:46:12,690 --> 00:46:13,830
But like,
you know,

1044
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:14,500
throwing,
you know,

1045
00:46:14,620 --> 00:46:15,480
uh,
it,

1046
00:46:15,750 --> 00:46:17,760
lock them away somewhere or something.
You know what I mean?

1047
00:46:17,910 --> 00:46:22,590
Don't continue to use them as a buffoon.
I was going to attack again.

1048
00:46:22,620 --> 00:46:25,470
Lock in a bear away would be cruel and 
unusual punishment.

1049
00:46:25,770 --> 00:46:28,860
I'd say just put one in his fucking dome
and at them in the wild.

1050
00:46:28,910 --> 00:46:29,970
Fuck it.
Give him a chance.

1051
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:30,280
He,
they,

1052
00:46:30,340 --> 00:46:35,340
that you take and you train and you do 
all that within it turns and eats your 

1053
00:46:35,340 --> 00:46:36,180
brother's fucking throat in front of 
you.

1054
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:41,540
You're supposed to kill that thing like 
crazy wild thing that you thought you 

1055
00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:41,760
were in control of.
The fuck is wrong.

1056
00:46:41,790 --> 00:46:46,790
If it was up to me,
I would take them up to the mountains 

1057
00:46:46,790 --> 00:46:46,790
and give him a check and now you 
probably had another lose.

1058
00:46:46,790 --> 00:46:48,090
No survival skills or anything good 
luck,

1059
00:46:48,091 --> 00:46:49,740
but at least you give them a chance.

1060
00:46:49,950 --> 00:46:52,140
Who knows?
Maybe they could make it maybe,

1061
00:46:52,141 --> 00:46:57,141
but they're probably not.
That's terrible idea because then you 

1062
00:46:57,141 --> 00:46:58,230
set an animal loose that's used to being
in contact with human beings and you set

1063
00:46:58,231 --> 00:47:03,231
them out in the woods and he will find 
human beings and it poses a direct 

1064
00:47:03,231 --> 00:47:03,930
threat to those people.
They're really dangerous.

1065
00:47:03,931 --> 00:47:07,710
Once you have habitualized a bear to 
people,

1066
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:10,350
they have to lock them up.
They have to put them in cages in zoos.

1067
00:47:10,590 --> 00:47:15,590
The zoos we went to in Colorado,
I learned that there because they had 

1068
00:47:15,590 --> 00:47:16,800
these bears and these bears had gotten 
their big ass grizzlies man,

1069
00:47:16,801 --> 00:47:21,801
big ass brown bears and they um,
they were getting into people's garbage 

1070
00:47:21,801 --> 00:47:22,770
and once they find this is where the 
people keep the food,

1071
00:47:22,771 --> 00:47:24,480
it's a source of food.
They won't go away.

1072
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:26,070
You can't scare them,
you know,

1073
00:47:26,071 --> 00:47:31,071
at a certain point in time,
they just get used to you and they just 

1074
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:31,071
fuck you.
So unless

1075
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:34,980
you shoot them,
they have to have someone come and 

1076
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:34,980
capture them and they leave and they 
take them away.

1077
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:36,990
You can't just let that bear,
I lose lose.

1078
00:47:37,050 --> 00:47:39,490
You'd find people in that.
One time I did,

1079
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:43,120
I did five grams of mushrooms and I went
to the zoo.

1080
00:47:43,121 --> 00:47:46,120
I thought it'd be a great idea and by 
the time I got to the zoo,

1081
00:47:46,570 --> 00:47:49,210
that's when it started kicking in.
I blew up at the zoo.

1082
00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:50,950
That freaked me out.
I'm like,

1083
00:47:50,951 --> 00:47:53,560
fuck,
these animals are fucking sad as hell.

1084
00:47:53,770 --> 00:47:58,180
They're all captured there in prison.
I ran out of that.

1085
00:47:58,181 --> 00:48:01,170
Got Em zoo.
That's how those people are jumping into

1086
00:48:01,171 --> 00:48:06,100
the polar bear bear cages.
I bet they're always on shrooms or bear.

1087
00:48:06,101 --> 00:48:11,101
The polar bear was there's like,
it's like a little fucking old school 

1088
00:48:11,101 --> 00:48:15,211
little auditorium theater thing that you
got for this polar bear and there's a 

1089
00:48:15,211 --> 00:48:18,781
door and I backstage and it just kept 
walking through that door and then walk 

1090
00:48:18,781 --> 00:48:22,891
away from the door like a couple of 
yards and walking back waiting for 

1091
00:48:22,891 --> 00:48:24,850
someone to open that door and it was 
just pacing back and forth nonstop.

1092
00:48:24,851 --> 00:48:26,830
This polar bear like,
wow,

1093
00:48:26,890 --> 00:48:29,080
I freaked the fuck out.
I was just hoping

1094
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:34,320
some asshole comes and opens the door 
and he can bite them and drag them and 

1095
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:35,600
finish him off.
You know?

1096
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:40,640
That's what they're doing.
They're just dying for someone to go in 

1097
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:40,640
there so they could track them.
Great.

1098
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:41,720
That's why they you.
You ever seen the video?

1099
00:48:41,721 --> 00:48:43,470
The lady getting her leg broken.
He.

1100
00:48:43,570 --> 00:48:48,570
He bites down on her leg and he's 
pulling her leg through the fucking 

1101
00:48:48,570 --> 00:48:50,370
bars.
It's polar bears are motherfuckers,

1102
00:48:50,510 --> 00:48:53,390
man.
They're real motherfuckers and you don't

1103
00:48:53,391 --> 00:48:55,970
ever really tame those things.
Those things are.

1104
00:48:56,020 --> 00:49:01,020
They're the craziest bears of all 
because they're the straight carnivore 

1105
00:49:01,020 --> 00:49:04,001
bears.
All the other bears eat fruits and 

1106
00:49:04,001 --> 00:49:06,161
berries.
It's no fucking fruits and berries with 

1107
00:49:06,161 --> 00:49:06,161
the polar bear lives.
Just Coca Cola,

1108
00:49:06,161 --> 00:49:10,000
just just seals and people and whatever 
the fuck else he can eat whales,

1109
00:49:11,361 --> 00:49:15,170
the whales,
they find a hole where a whale got stuck

1110
00:49:15,171 --> 00:49:17,420
under a giant sheet of ice.
The whale can't go anywhere,

1111
00:49:17,540 --> 00:49:19,670
so every time the whale comes up to get 
some air,

1112
00:49:19,820 --> 00:49:20,720
boom,
polar bear.

1113
00:49:20,721 --> 00:49:23,330
Jackson takes a bite out of them.
So these whales,

1114
00:49:23,331 --> 00:49:26,720
like you see him and after a while 
they're the top of their back.

1115
00:49:26,721 --> 00:49:29,000
It's just destroyed.
Whoa.

1116
00:49:29,030 --> 00:49:34,030
From polar bears,
just biting them over and over and over 

1117
00:49:34,030 --> 00:49:34,400
and over again,
and then eventually they kill it.

1118
00:49:34,820 --> 00:49:38,210
So small whale or something like that.
It gets stuck in their pilot whale.

1119
00:49:38,450 --> 00:49:41,090
They just slowly bite them to death.

1120
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:46,280
That's incredible.
Did you see the video that Mary Archie 

1121
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:49,440
Band playing a song music for?
I think it was a.

1122
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:52,350
What are the snow lions or something 
like that?

1123
00:49:52,351 --> 00:49:55,950
Snow leopards snow.
There's big things as big blobby.

1124
00:49:55,951 --> 00:50:00,951
They almost like hippos.
Like what's the ones that are all seals 

1125
00:50:00,951 --> 00:50:03,330
and sea lions?
Maybe that,

1126
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:05,590
but it was so cool.
They were the.

1127
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:09,030
It looked like it was having a fun time 
watching,

1128
00:50:09,060 --> 00:50:11,400
like it was going back and forth.
It's explaining what you saw.

1129
00:50:11,410 --> 00:50:12,750
Okay.
Here I'll show it to you.

1130
00:50:12,751 --> 00:50:14,190
It's a,
I think it's on Google.

1131
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:17,340
Mariachi band,
Mariachi band.

1132
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:22,530
A Sea lion.
So they're playing the music and the sea

1133
00:50:22,531 --> 00:50:24,510
lions dancing along with it.
Is that what you're saying?

1134
00:50:24,540 --> 00:50:25,150
Yeah,
it's,

1135
00:50:25,151 --> 00:50:26,780
it's amazing.
And like,

1136
00:50:26,830 --> 00:50:28,040
uh,
when the trumpet players

1137
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:33,040
would like to do in,
like tilt his head up and down and then 

1138
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:36,360
would head up and down and it just 
looked like it was having the time of 

1139
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:40,571
its life.
It's one of the coolest videos I've 

1140
00:50:40,571 --> 00:50:40,571
seen.
I'll find it right now for the wonder.

1141
00:50:40,571 --> 00:50:44,321
I always wonder like what music,
what kind of an effect music would have 

1142
00:50:44,321 --> 00:50:47,501
on animals because you know,
in the animal kingdom it's actually a 

1143
00:50:47,501 --> 00:50:50,921
Beluga whale occasion at all.
But why wouldn't music impact them the 

1144
00:50:50,921 --> 00:50:55,691
same way it impacts us?
Why wouldn't it be exciting and 

1145
00:50:55,691 --> 00:50:55,691
interesting to them?

1146
00:50:55,691 --> 00:50:56,620
It's actually a Beluga whale and if you 
look at it,

1147
00:50:58,120 --> 00:51:01,630
it's a on [inaudible] dot com.
It's Mariachi Band serenades,

1148
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:05,650
that Beluga whale and it's just going 
back and forth.

1149
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:09,380
Well that makes sense as well as a way 
smarter than you realize.

1150
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:12,500
And they started.
It is.

1151
00:51:15,460 --> 00:51:16,420
I didn't,
I didn't,

1152
00:51:16,430 --> 00:51:17,540
I couldn't remember what it was.

1153
00:51:21,870 --> 00:51:26,870
They start playing more and more and it 
starts really like nodding its head and 

1154
00:51:26,870 --> 00:51:27,570
you know,
you know what's interesting about this,

1155
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:32,840
that we're,
we're amazed that this is intelligent 

1156
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:32,840
because if that was a person and if you 
like,

1157
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:36,420
look at my boy,
I took my boy to see the Mariachi band.

1158
00:51:36,570 --> 00:51:39,270
Look how my boy nods.
Nods.

1159
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:42,270
He acknowledges them,
they acknowledged him back.

1160
00:51:43,050 --> 00:51:44,550
My Boys.
Brilliant.

1161
00:51:44,580 --> 00:51:48,900
So far is not really doing anything but 
what I'm saying to get better.

1162
00:51:48,930 --> 00:51:51,330
The only reason why this is interesting 
is because it's not a human.

1163
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:56,370
If it's a person that's a drooling idiot
listening to bad music.

1164
00:51:59,210 --> 00:52:00,630
Okay,
wait,

1165
00:52:01,070 --> 00:52:01,760
let me see.
I'm like,

1166
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:02,870
get to the good part

1167
00:52:05,900 --> 00:52:06,860
right now.
He's just going,

1168
00:52:06,861 --> 00:52:11,861
what the fuck are those hats?
Or before they hear the nodding with 

1169
00:52:11,861 --> 00:52:12,260
the,
with the music and stuff like that.

1170
00:52:13,020 --> 00:52:18,020
I mean it's kind of cute.
I'm not saying it's like a breakthrough 

1171
00:52:18,020 --> 00:52:18,240
in science or anything.
It's just a cool video to watch.

1172
00:52:18,241 --> 00:52:20,270
I think you were saying it was a 
breakthrough in science.

1173
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:25,300
I think that's.
I think that dolphins like you guys got 

1174
00:52:25,300 --> 00:52:25,300
fish or something.
What's going on?

1175
00:52:25,300 --> 00:52:27,110
Yeah.
I think he's bored as fuck.

1176
00:52:27,620 --> 00:52:30,320
Trapped in snack time.
What's going on?

1177
00:52:30,321 --> 00:52:32,250
People are filming him.
I chose assholes.

1178
00:52:32,251 --> 00:52:33,990
Make weird music.
Yeah.

1179
00:52:33,991 --> 00:52:35,350
Poor thing.
See in jail.

1180
00:52:35,660 --> 00:52:40,660
Things in jail.
No wonder he fucking stare at you when 

1181
00:52:40,660 --> 00:52:40,660
it comes to the glass.
Yeah.

1182
00:52:40,660 --> 00:52:40,740
Wow.
Amazing.

1183
00:52:40,741 --> 00:52:43,720
I'm going to let me go.
Did a Freedom Day.

1184
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:46,920
That's the thing that we have to be the 
most concerned about with aliens,

1185
00:52:46,921 --> 00:52:51,921
man,
because of the disrespect that we have 

1186
00:52:51,921 --> 00:52:52,410
for everything even remotely dumber than
us.

1187
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:54,660
Even whales,
killer whales,

1188
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:56,010
orcas,
dolphins.

1189
00:52:56,190 --> 00:52:58,170
Those are thought to be really 
intelligent animals.

1190
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:00,810
We don't totally understand their,
their languages.

1191
00:53:00,811 --> 00:53:05,811
We know that they have,
like some of them have dialects and 

1192
00:53:05,811 --> 00:53:05,811
she'll like.
There's.

1193
00:53:05,811 --> 00:53:06,720
They're really complicated.
Both killer whales and dolphins.

1194
00:53:06,721 --> 00:53:09,660
They're like cousins of each other,
but we don't understand what they say,

1195
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:10,750
so we were like,
mm,

1196
00:53:11,060 --> 00:53:16,060
I don't give a fuck getting the tank,
and we just forced them into prison for 

1197
00:53:16,060 --> 00:53:19,881
us.
We and we all go watch them perform and 

1198
00:53:19,881 --> 00:53:21,240
fly through the air and splash as 
everybody claps.

1199
00:53:21,390 --> 00:53:26,070
We're watching slaves were watching 
babies that stolen from

1200
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:31,070
their mothers,
from intelligent animals that miss them 

1201
00:53:31,070 --> 00:53:31,070
and we don't care because we don't 
understand what they're saying.

1202
00:53:31,070 --> 00:53:31,380
La,
la,

1203
00:53:31,381 --> 00:53:32,580
la.
I'm not listening.

1204
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:36,610
What's the latest on deciphering the 
Dolphin or whale language?

1205
00:53:36,611 --> 00:53:38,820
I mean because we're trying to teach 
them our words like jump.

1206
00:53:38,850 --> 00:53:40,020
That's the tricky thing.
They,

1207
00:53:40,021 --> 00:53:41,610
you know,
they can recognize many,

1208
00:53:41,611 --> 00:53:46,611
many human words,
but we can't understand a single thing 

1209
00:53:46,611 --> 00:53:47,700
they're saying there's got to be someone
on the case trying to decipher that shit

1210
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:50,580
will be.
Leary was not timothy leary rather.

1211
00:53:50,581 --> 00:53:53,130
I'm the guy who created,
created the isolation tank.

1212
00:53:53,210 --> 00:53:58,210
Goddammit.
Is there some new shit with the 

1213
00:53:58,210 --> 00:53:58,410
isolation tank where they're sending 
radio waves through it now?

1214
00:53:58,620 --> 00:54:03,620
Is there.
So is that the latest thing or is that 

1215
00:54:03,620 --> 00:54:04,941
still you laying in water at a certain 
temperature or is there some 

1216
00:54:04,941 --> 00:54:06,310
electromagnetic shit going on now?
Will they do have a John Lilly do?

1217
00:54:06,310 --> 00:54:08,080
They do have some where they,
um,

1218
00:54:08,180 --> 00:54:13,180
they play sound float lab has got some 
crazy new video screen that they're 

1219
00:54:13,291 --> 00:54:18,291
developing where it's,
it sits right in front of you and has 

1220
00:54:18,291 --> 00:54:21,270
the lowest possible emission of light so
that you don't see the machinery at all.

1221
00:54:21,271 --> 00:54:26,271
All you see is the image that's being 
played on this DVD because you're in 

1222
00:54:26,271 --> 00:54:27,890
total complete darkness in there.
And the speakers are these,

1223
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:32,100
these sort of underwater waterproof 
speakers that are beside each year.

1224
00:54:32,101 --> 00:54:33,750
They're fixed,
fixed in place.

1225
00:54:33,900 --> 00:54:37,560
So you set yourself in between these two
speakers and then this video plays.

1226
00:54:37,561 --> 00:54:39,960
And in the sensory deprivation 
environment,

1227
00:54:40,290 --> 00:54:43,860
when you're in there,
you are weightless and body list and you

1228
00:54:43,861 --> 00:54:48,861
don't feel shit.
You feel like you're flying through the 

1229
00:54:48,861 --> 00:54:48,861
universe and then all of a sudden this 
image appears right before you.

1230
00:54:48,861 --> 00:54:51,480
And the sound of it.
It sounds pretty dope.

1231
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:52,900
I haven't tried it though.
Well,

1232
00:54:53,020 --> 00:54:55,700
I like going in there and just,
I don't want to,

1233
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:57,660
I don't,
I'm not looking to add anything.

1234
00:54:57,870 --> 00:55:00,030
I'm looking to figure out what the fuck 
is out there.

1235
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:01,230
You know,
when I go into the tank,

1236
00:55:01,290 --> 00:55:02,730
I'm never thinking,
oh,

1237
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:06,990
how dope would this if I played a whole 
lot of love while while I was in there.

1238
00:55:07,060 --> 00:55:08,430
Let's get.
I'm gonna get high as fuck.

1239
00:55:08,490 --> 00:55:09,020
And then um,
uh,

1240
00:55:11,310 --> 00:55:13,050
you know,
it would be cool to do,

1241
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:15,390
but to me,
my time in there,

1242
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:16,940
what I,
what I'm,

1243
00:55:17,010 --> 00:55:19,180
what I gravitate towards is doing it 
with nothing.

1244
00:55:19,220 --> 00:55:19,810
I'm,
I like,

1245
00:55:19,860 --> 00:55:24,860
I like,
I like silence and I like seeing where 

1246
00:55:24,860 --> 00:55:25,740
the fuck my crazy imagination takes me 
or where,

1247
00:55:25,741 --> 00:55:27,480
where,
where the muse takes me,

1248
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:28,890
wherever,
whatever happens.

1249
00:55:29,140 --> 00:55:34,140
Now imagine recording of it.
Did you see that thing where scientists 

1250
00:55:34,140 --> 00:55:34,840
can now record,
and this is scary.

1251
00:55:35,020 --> 00:55:40,020
This is a thing they have on Gizmodo,
but where they had somebody watch a 

1252
00:55:40,020 --> 00:55:44,851
bunch of videos and,
and then they recorded the brain's 

1253
00:55:44,851 --> 00:55:45,790
activity and they,
they show on this video.

1254
00:55:45,791 --> 00:55:50,620
It compares what they actually saw and 
what the brain sees the cats.

1255
00:55:50,621 --> 00:55:53,200
I've seen that they've recorded,
so can you,

1256
00:55:53,230 --> 00:55:58,230
can you imagine now that that like 10 
years from now they're going to be able 

1257
00:55:58,230 --> 00:56:01,411
to like record everything that you see.
You're not going to be able to lie 

1258
00:56:01,411 --> 00:56:05,011
anymore.
You're not going to be able to do 

1259
00:56:05,011 --> 00:56:05,011
anything where it's headed.
Ultimately they'll.

1260
00:56:05,011 --> 00:56:08,550
There'll be waterproof iphones that you 
could swim with and that translates what

1261
00:56:09,401 --> 00:56:14,401
you're saying to dolphin language so 
that you can just communicate with 

1262
00:56:14,401 --> 00:56:14,401
dolphins.
I mean,

1263
00:56:14,401 --> 00:56:14,401
it's getting crazy,
right?

1264
00:56:14,460 --> 00:56:16,480
I don't think they're ever going to be 
able to figure out the dolphin thing.

1265
00:56:16,481 --> 00:56:18,940
They're so far off.
Dolphin APP never say never.

1266
00:56:19,070 --> 00:56:24,070
Humans,
humans communicating with humans is 

1267
00:56:24,070 --> 00:56:24,070
going to get real weird man.
You know,

1268
00:56:24,070 --> 00:56:24,300
can figure that dolphin

1269
00:56:24,310 --> 00:56:25,510
boy,
they're not close.

1270
00:56:25,511 --> 00:56:30,511
They're not even close.
I don't know what the fuck the dolphins 

1271
00:56:30,511 --> 00:56:30,511
are saying.
You don't know what.

1272
00:56:30,511 --> 00:56:33,450
They can't talk the dolphins.
They can't send out a message to the 

1273
00:56:33,450 --> 00:56:33,450
dolphins.
Hello Dolphin world.

1274
00:56:33,450 --> 00:56:35,480
We are friendly,
but what if they created some instrument

1275
00:56:35,660 --> 00:56:37,580
where they decide for some sounds and 
they go,

1276
00:56:37,581 --> 00:56:39,350
let's see what this sound.
You know,

1277
00:56:39,460 --> 00:56:41,080
dissect the sounds,
edit them,

1278
00:56:41,170 --> 00:56:46,170
put them together and then plan for the 
Dolphin and maybe the dog because that 

1279
00:56:46,170 --> 00:56:46,170
doesn't make any sense,
but that was kind of weird,

1280
00:56:46,230 --> 00:56:49,210
right?
They may slowly put words together like,

1281
00:56:49,270 --> 00:56:50,080
oh,
we got eat.

1282
00:56:50,081 --> 00:56:52,840
We got the one for.
Even if they had like rewords down,

1283
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:54,390
you know what I mean?
Then they go,

1284
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:58,010
I mean maybe we should research where 
the,

1285
00:56:58,011 --> 00:57:03,011
the,
the Dolphin communication world is that 

1286
00:57:03,011 --> 00:57:03,011
right now I want to know.
I want to.

1287
00:57:03,011 --> 00:57:06,670
I know that a mentoree John Lilly,
that was one of the reasons why I 

1288
00:57:06,670 --> 00:57:09,841
created a what,
what would he rather uses that he used 

1289
00:57:09,841 --> 00:57:12,751
the tank for?
He used to put a tank on isolation tank 

1290
00:57:12,751 --> 00:57:15,991
right next to the dolphin tank and he 
would drop acid and get into the tank 

1291
00:57:15,991 --> 00:57:19,860
and communicate with the dolphins and 
he's like this pioneer and interspecies 

1292
00:57:19,860 --> 00:57:22,360
communication and because of that,
but what does that mean?

1293
00:57:22,361 --> 00:57:23,380
I mean,
how much have they figured out?

1294
00:57:23,381 --> 00:57:28,381
As far as I know,
they have figured out very little and I 

1295
00:57:28,381 --> 00:57:28,960
think we're the whole dolphin language 
is a mystery,

1296
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:33,220
but we do know that they have dialects.
We know that different dolphin pods have

1297
00:57:33,221 --> 00:57:35,370
like a,
like if they're from a different place,

1298
00:57:35,371 --> 00:57:38,800
I'll have like a different twice.
If they know that they can tell that the

1299
00:57:38,801 --> 00:57:43,801
different dialect,
they can decipher one little sound like 

1300
00:57:43,801 --> 00:57:44,290
maybe,
maybe something in the.

1301
00:57:44,410 --> 00:57:47,740
I think it's a matter of context.
If you lived in a world,

1302
00:57:47,750 --> 00:57:52,750
see we have.
We live in a material world as as the 

1303
00:57:52,750 --> 00:57:56,611
ocean oceans and material world,
but it's in a material world where 

1304
00:57:56,611 --> 00:57:58,330
you're not stuck to the ground.
You're going all over the place,

1305
00:57:58,331 --> 00:58:03,331
your world,
your you've are flying through your 

1306
00:58:03,331 --> 00:58:06,301
world.
Everyone is flying through the world of 

1307
00:58:06,301 --> 00:58:08,851
the ocean.
It's a completely different experience 

1308
00:58:08,851 --> 00:58:09,250
to not be able to alter your 
environment,

1309
00:58:09,251 --> 00:58:13,200
to develop some sort of intelligence to 
the level that dolphins have and,

1310
00:58:13,201 --> 00:58:15,760
and orcas have to the point where 
they'll help people.

1311
00:58:15,790 --> 00:58:18,010
They recognize when people are in 
trouble and they help them.

1312
00:58:18,220 --> 00:58:20,700
Like killer whales will like help people
get to boats.

1313
00:58:20,790 --> 00:58:23,410
I want to see,
I want to read something on that twitter

1314
00:58:23,411 --> 00:58:28,270
people I want some like documented 
that's happened where and exactly what's

1315
00:58:28,271 --> 00:58:33,271
happened.
Like how the hell bent more than one 

1316
00:58:33,271 --> 00:58:35,881
instance of guys capsizing boats and 
Orcas helping them help them back into 

1317
00:58:35,881 --> 00:58:39,520
the boat to amazing how they don't 
attack humans.

1318
00:58:39,780 --> 00:58:44,780
They don't.
People swim with like a pod of Orca 

1319
00:58:44,780 --> 00:58:44,780
where they go,
they.

1320
00:58:44,780 --> 00:58:49,370
Yeah.
I don't know if they will let you do 

1321
00:58:49,370 --> 00:58:49,480
that man.
I don't know if they have children.

1322
00:58:49,481 --> 00:58:54,481
That doesn't seem to be a good idea.
I know you know people have been bitten 

1323
00:58:54,481 --> 00:58:58,441
or nudged or bumped and shit before,
but I think they're pretty fucking easy 

1324
00:58:58,441 --> 00:58:59,470
going with people.
There was something I read online a long

1325
00:58:59,471 --> 00:59:00,880
time ago,
but it turned out to be horseshit.

1326
00:59:01,170 --> 00:59:06,170
It was that people used to get killed by
killer whales all the time until a 

1327
00:59:06,170 --> 00:59:09,220
fighter pilots in world war two started 
using orchids for target practice,

1328
00:59:09,990 --> 00:59:11,410
you know,
and they don't do shit like that.

1329
00:59:11,411 --> 00:59:16,411
I mean they would use like killer whales
or sharks or something like that for 

1330
00:59:16,411 --> 00:59:16,750
target practice when they're dry fly.
And I heard that,

1331
00:59:16,751 --> 00:59:20,140
and then all of a sudden killer whales 
stop killing people.

1332
00:59:20,190 --> 00:59:21,700
They had like some kind of committee and
says,

1333
00:59:21,810 --> 00:59:22,010
you know

1334
00:59:22,010 --> 00:59:22,560
what,
it's a.

1335
00:59:22,561 --> 00:59:26,000
it's a good idea for the,
for the existence of our species.

1336
00:59:26,001 --> 00:59:31,001
Don't fuck with these humans.
These pink monkeys with their bang 

1337
00:59:31,001 --> 00:59:31,001
sticks.
You don't want to be fucking with them.

1338
00:59:31,001 --> 00:59:35,531
They can do some damage.
They can get out in our world that we 

1339
00:59:35,531 --> 00:59:35,840
can't go to their world.
So they just get in big wooden boats and

1340
00:59:35,841 --> 00:59:38,240
go out to our world.
And as long as the boat's big enough,

1341
00:59:38,241 --> 00:59:40,550
you get in one of those giant ocean 
liner type things.

1342
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:42,440
What the fuck's killer?
We're going to do that.

1343
00:59:42,470 --> 00:59:44,330
You can just go around and jacking up 
left and right.

1344
00:59:45,010 --> 00:59:47,420
It was terrible environment they live 
in.

1345
00:59:47,510 --> 00:59:52,510
It's crazy how the dolphins and the 
Caribbean or in the Gulf of Mexico or 

1346
00:59:53,180 --> 00:59:54,650
the Bahamas,
not area,

1347
00:59:54,980 --> 00:59:59,980
the ones they study,
they did a documentary on it and it's a 

1348
00:59:59,980 --> 01:00:02,300
trip.
How they capture females,

1349
01:00:02,301 --> 01:00:05,180
they capture them either to males.

1350
01:00:05,570 --> 01:00:10,570
It's either two males and they captured 
one female at a time for like a month 

1351
01:00:10,570 --> 01:00:13,901
and then they jacker or it's a big group
of males like 15 to 20 and they capture 

1352
01:00:14,061 --> 01:00:19,061
a bunch of females and make sure they 
don't swim off the pot and they're just 

1353
01:00:19,061 --> 01:00:21,920
taking turns on them and it's funny is 
the girls want to leave.

1354
01:00:22,070 --> 01:00:24,290
They want to take off.
They don't want to be captured,

1355
01:00:24,380 --> 01:00:29,380
not because they don't want to have sex,
but because they want to have sex with 

1356
01:00:29,380 --> 01:00:31,430
as many males in that region,
so when they have their baby,

1357
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:32,850
if they.
It's like a.

1358
01:00:33,020 --> 01:00:38,020
A woman female dolphin had sex with a 
hundred male dolphins when she gives 

1359
01:00:38,721 --> 01:00:42,860
birth and she asked to watch over her 
child for the first three or four years.

1360
01:00:43,550 --> 01:00:46,280
If she runs into and she's by herself 
with her child,

1361
01:00:46,290 --> 01:00:48,710
they're just swimming around when they 
run into males.

1362
01:00:48,890 --> 01:00:51,530
If those males have had sex with her,
they'll leave her alone.

1363
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:54,320
If those males that run into a didn't 
have sex with her,

1364
01:00:54,510 --> 01:00:59,510
they will kill that baby and then 
capture her and bring her into their 

1365
01:00:59,510 --> 01:01:01,130
little Harem.
They will kill the baby boy,

1366
01:01:01,131 --> 01:01:02,600
that's not that,
but if they run into them,

1367
01:01:02,750 --> 01:01:06,590
so that's so the female has to have as 
much sex as possible.

1368
01:01:06,591 --> 01:01:11,591
She's down with the sexual,
but she wants to leave and go find some 

1369
01:01:11,591 --> 01:01:12,500
more guys before the baby hatches.
It's crazy,

1370
01:01:12,501 --> 01:01:14,510
right?
It's insane.

1371
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:19,720
It's insane.
But it's the same because people think 

1372
01:01:19,720 --> 01:01:19,720
of dolphins as being these fun,
loving,

1373
01:01:19,720 --> 01:01:23,891
whimsical fairies of the sea.
There are cousins that are fairies in 

1374
01:01:23,891 --> 01:01:28,611
the sea.
They're all loving because you know 

1375
01:01:28,611 --> 01:01:28,611
they're,
they're cool as fuck to us.

1376
01:01:28,611 --> 01:01:32,591
You know,
if you ever in a boat and you're 

1377
01:01:32,591 --> 01:01:32,591
swimming by some dolphins are robots,
dolphins,

1378
01:01:32,591 --> 01:01:33,920
they'll jump up and play with you.

1379
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:35,270
You know,
it's interesting,

1380
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:38,150
but in the dolphin world,
when things get hard,

1381
01:01:38,151 --> 01:01:39,230
shit gets crazy.
Yeah,

1382
01:01:39,240 --> 01:01:44,240
I know when it's a big group of males 
and they run into a couple of dudes who 

1383
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:47,540
have captured a check,
they will jack those dudes.

1384
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:49,570
And steel is steel there,
girl like that.

1385
01:01:49,580 --> 01:01:53,060
This is our girl now.
Crazy evil bitches.

1386
01:01:53,330 --> 01:01:55,490
So dolphins are just like people a lot 
of ways.

1387
01:01:55,820 --> 01:01:57,590
Everything intelligent.
This is what I was saying,

1388
01:01:57,930 --> 01:01:59,780
things in that region.
Not all dolphins,

1389
01:01:59,781 --> 01:02:03,060
I don't think all Davao,
they all have their own special,

1390
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:05,360
but every mating rituals.
Well,

1391
01:02:05,361 --> 01:02:10,361
you know,
killer whales killed dolphins all the 

1392
01:02:10,361 --> 01:02:12,131
time and not only that,
killer whales got their name not from 

1393
01:02:12,131 --> 01:02:12,560
being killers,
but from killing whales.

1394
01:02:12,920 --> 01:02:17,920
That's what they,
that's where they came up with the name 

1395
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:17,920
of killer whales,
killer whales.

1396
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:21,660
Fuck whales up.
There's some horrible videos of killer 

1397
01:02:21,660 --> 01:02:21,660
whales

1398
01:02:21,660 --> 01:02:22,710
biting a whale's face off like a blue 
whale or something.

1399
01:02:22,711 --> 01:02:23,420
Yeah,
like a big,

1400
01:02:23,460 --> 01:02:28,460
big ass whale and just jack and his face
and the wheels trying to swim away and 

1401
01:02:28,460 --> 01:02:29,340
they're just fucking this whale up and 
it's like,

1402
01:02:29,341 --> 01:02:30,600
it makes you really like,
think like,

1403
01:02:30,601 --> 01:02:35,601
wow.
Like what we think of is like some cute 

1404
01:02:35,601 --> 01:02:36,930
thing that does tricks at the zoo.
That's a murdering monster that lives in

1405
01:02:36,931 --> 01:02:41,931
the ocean and they're smart and think 
about what we do to them.

1406
01:02:42,690 --> 01:02:45,300
It's just we don't give a fuck.
We can't understand them.

1407
01:02:45,420 --> 01:02:47,430
So we just put them in the cage.
Get in there,

1408
01:02:47,431 --> 01:02:48,690
bitch.
I don't know what you're saying.

1409
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:51,070
They're going,

1410
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:52,750
my mother.
My father,

1411
01:02:52,790 --> 01:02:54,750
Ms Dot my family.
What are you doing?

1412
01:02:54,751 --> 01:02:57,230
Um,
I was born to swim the open seas.

1413
01:02:57,250 --> 01:03:02,250
All we hear is what if they have the 
answers to the universe?

1414
01:03:02,581 --> 01:03:04,800
They know all the answers where we came 
from,

1415
01:03:04,801 --> 01:03:07,320
they know everything they,
they've been trying to tell us,

1416
01:03:07,710 --> 01:03:09,780
but they just can't communicate when we 
don't listen,

1417
01:03:09,810 --> 01:03:10,750
logged in.
They're just,

1418
01:03:10,950 --> 01:03:13,050
they know all about the Galactic 
Federation.

1419
01:03:13,051 --> 01:03:14,460
They know what's going on and go,
dude,

1420
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:16,410
a comment's going to jack you in three 
years.

1421
01:03:16,411 --> 01:03:20,220
You better get on.
Father was like ones and Zeros.

1422
01:03:20,221 --> 01:03:22,920
It was all like modem sounds and we just
haven't been able to.

1423
01:03:23,290 --> 01:03:25,120
People are so.
Yeah,

1424
01:03:25,980 --> 01:03:26,350
right?

1425
01:03:29,900 --> 01:03:30,200
Yeah.

1426
01:03:30,290 --> 01:03:33,890
People are so fucking toxic.
We don't just ruin our world.

1427
01:03:34,010 --> 01:03:39,010
We ruined the ocean world too.
We pollute the ocean world and we eat 

1428
01:03:39,010 --> 01:03:41,180
everything that's in there.
I mean if you think about the two worlds

1429
01:03:41,181 --> 01:03:43,820
that exist right next to each other.
Okay.

1430
01:03:43,910 --> 01:03:46,580
There's the world of land and in this 
world of the ocean,

1431
01:03:46,581 --> 01:03:49,220
in the world of land,
you don't get to fly,

1432
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:52,160
but unless you get in tubes and metal 
and shit like that,

1433
01:03:52,161 --> 01:03:57,161
but you do get to manipulate matter.
You get to use your thumbs and make 

1434
01:03:57,161 --> 01:03:59,150
things and create things.
The world of the ocean,

1435
01:03:59,151 --> 01:04:02,330
you can fly all over the place,
but you can't manipulate matter.

1436
01:04:02,331 --> 01:04:03,170
Well,
what happens?

1437
01:04:03,171 --> 01:04:08,171
Well,
the ones who get manipulate matter to 

1438
01:04:08,171 --> 01:04:10,161
figure out a way to make tools and make 
a vehicles to fly over to where you live

1439
01:04:10,371 --> 01:04:13,130
and fuck you up.
You know what we're doing,

1440
01:04:13,131 --> 01:04:16,780
we don't think about we are at war with 
the ocean and we're.

1441
01:04:16,810 --> 01:04:19,520
We're in a,
in an ocean of oxygen.

1442
01:04:19,550 --> 01:04:22,320
We're just like crabs.
We just can't sweat around.

1443
01:04:22,321 --> 01:04:24,020
We're just the bottom feeders.
You know?

1444
01:04:24,590 --> 01:04:27,290
There's a lot of motherfuckers flying 
around birds and shit.

1445
01:04:27,291 --> 01:04:30,750
It's an ocean of oxygen that we're 
walking around and yeah,

1446
01:04:30,770 --> 01:04:32,000
but in the,
in the ocean,

1447
01:04:32,060 --> 01:04:33,110
yeah,
that's very true.

1448
01:04:33,111 --> 01:04:33,920
Right?
And we are the,

1449
01:04:33,921 --> 01:04:36,320
the crabs of the outer world,
right?

1450
01:04:36,890 --> 01:04:39,440
Because there are animals.
It's not like the water.

1451
01:04:39,441 --> 01:04:42,250
There's water and then there's oxygen.
It's just crap.

1452
01:04:42,320 --> 01:04:44,240
That's a good point because cramps can't
fucking swim.

1453
01:04:44,630 --> 01:04:47,630
They just stuck there.
They're down there to clean things.

1454
01:04:47,690 --> 01:04:48,960
Hate those fuckers.
Cleanup.

1455
01:04:48,980 --> 01:04:50,380
Stupid.
Yeah.

1456
01:04:52,130 --> 01:04:57,130
That's the when sharks run around Jack 
and people and a foot falls to the 

1457
01:04:57,130 --> 01:04:57,560
ground.
So the crabs,

1458
01:04:57,590 --> 01:04:59,890
crabs go at it.
That football?

1459
01:05:00,860 --> 01:05:02,410
Yeah,
and crabs.

1460
01:05:03,350 --> 01:05:06,140
Always known for the term crabs in a 
bucket.

1461
01:05:06,620 --> 01:05:08,960
Whenever you.
You're around people and they're fucking

1462
01:05:08,961 --> 01:05:13,961
holding each other down.
Do people still get cramps but people 

1463
01:05:13,961 --> 01:05:14,770
still getting cramps?
That's not still around 70,

1464
01:05:15,490 --> 01:05:16,760
79.
I don't know.

1465
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:18,910
I heard of crabs in years,
but I'm sure it's out there.

1466
01:05:18,911 --> 01:05:23,911
You just gotTa look for it.
And then high school they used to say 

1467
01:05:23,911 --> 01:05:23,911
that,
dude,

1468
01:05:23,911 --> 01:05:26,110
I got the crabs.
Crabs like the wrong dirty,

1469
01:05:26,111 --> 01:05:27,520
dirty,
dirty bitch.

1470
01:05:28,450 --> 01:05:29,560
Yeah,
hippies.

1471
01:05:32,190 --> 01:05:37,190
Hippies really can.
You have crabs if you shaved your pussy 

1472
01:05:37,190 --> 01:05:37,870
and they've really hard.
It's harder.

1473
01:05:38,350 --> 01:05:40,230
That's probably why girls started 
shaving their policies.

1474
01:05:40,231 --> 01:05:41,800
It was always the form checks,
right?

1475
01:05:41,801 --> 01:05:44,630
They gotta do we gotTa fucking shave.
So it's like a chemo thing,

1476
01:05:44,631 --> 01:05:45,190
you know,
at first.

1477
01:05:45,191 --> 01:05:46,480
But then it became cool.
Well,

1478
01:05:46,481 --> 01:05:47,450
you know,
there was like a,

1479
01:05:47,451 --> 01:05:52,451
a run of people who thought it was 
offensive to ask women to shave their 

1480
01:05:52,451 --> 01:05:52,740
pussies.
There was like a big,

1481
01:05:52,810 --> 01:05:54,700
you know,
back in the day when women had bushes.

1482
01:05:54,850 --> 01:05:59,850
I remember like the debates when it was 
like porn was starting to alter people's

1483
01:06:00,041 --> 01:06:03,370
perceptions of what sexual organs could,
should look like.

1484
01:06:03,570 --> 01:06:08,570
And I've read some,
some thing about this where they were 

1485
01:06:08,570 --> 01:06:08,570
discussing how,
you know,

1486
01:06:08,570 --> 01:06:12,030
women are upset that their husbands want
them to shave their pussies and make it 

1487
01:06:12,030 --> 01:06:13,150
look like the porn girls.

1488
01:06:13,410 --> 01:06:18,410
You know,
that it's offensive and it's 

1489
01:06:18,410 --> 01:06:18,410
objectifying.
But now everyone shapes.

1490
01:06:18,430 --> 01:06:22,030
The only thing about a hairy pussy is,
is I used to like,

1491
01:06:22,080 --> 01:06:24,220
I used to prefer hairy pussies in my 
early twenties,

1492
01:06:24,221 --> 01:06:29,221
believe it or not because girls had 
shaved sometimes if they didn't shave 

1493
01:06:29,221 --> 01:06:29,221
and they have that,
that,

1494
01:06:29,221 --> 01:06:33,001
that roughness.
It's like you're fucking sandpaper 

1495
01:06:33,001 --> 01:06:33,001
sometimes,
but if they're,

1496
01:06:33,001 --> 01:06:36,510
if they have like a bush,
it's all mushy gushy and machines soft.

1497
01:06:38,470 --> 01:06:41,530
Right.
I wonder why it's there specifically.

1498
01:06:41,680 --> 01:06:46,680
Do you think that's what it is?
It's an eyelash there because people 

1499
01:06:46,680 --> 01:06:47,260
usually fuck missionary and it's to 
protect that area.

1500
01:06:47,290 --> 01:06:52,290
No,
it's a hair is a good way to send off 

1501
01:06:52,290 --> 01:06:54,010
your sense.
Does the hair and then wind blows on the

1502
01:06:54,011 --> 01:06:55,300
hair and then.
Oh,

1503
01:06:55,301 --> 01:06:57,870
so that's why it's around your asshole.
Yep.

1504
01:06:57,900 --> 01:06:59,790
So you can send out the asshole Sunday 
up.

1505
01:06:59,791 --> 01:07:04,080
Apparently farts are aphrodisiacs or 
when we were cavemen whites.

1506
01:07:04,210 --> 01:07:06,100
Yep.
Because it was awesome that this guy got

1507
01:07:06,101 --> 01:07:08,580
some food.
I like foreign.

1508
01:07:09,130 --> 01:07:11,740
That motherfucker just ate an elk.
A Saber.

1509
01:07:11,741 --> 01:07:13,330
Tooth tiger.
God dammit.

1510
01:07:13,510 --> 01:07:15,490
Figured out.
I take that brontosaurus down.

1511
01:07:15,491 --> 01:07:18,760
Now he's in my face.
Have you heard of Americans?

1512
01:07:19,050 --> 01:07:20,290
Americans are.
Yeah.

1513
01:07:20,350 --> 01:07:22,480
It's like a fake pube yeah.
Yeah.

1514
01:07:22,500 --> 01:07:25,540
There's a fig pubic hair you can buy 
like a lot of girls like to do the laser

1515
01:07:25,541 --> 01:07:30,541
now down there and get all their pubic 
hair taken away and then they buy 

1516
01:07:30,541 --> 01:07:32,530
Merkins if they ever want pubic hair 
once.

1517
01:07:32,710 --> 01:07:34,570
That's crazy.
They were like a pubic hair.

1518
01:07:34,580 --> 01:07:37,650
Tupac.
Tupac fashion ones that they use.

1519
01:07:37,990 --> 01:07:38,650
Who would,
who?

1520
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:39,960
Japanese.
That's my gosh.

1521
01:07:40,360 --> 01:07:41,260
I have no idea.
Oh,

1522
01:07:41,261 --> 01:07:42,010
it is.
No,

1523
01:07:42,011 --> 01:07:47,011
no,
that's what I would say that people at 

1524
01:07:47,011 --> 01:07:47,011
burning man,
they like the craziest shit.

1525
01:07:47,011 --> 01:07:48,670
You know Japanese can't.
You're not allowed to show pubic hair.

1526
01:07:48,671 --> 01:07:49,450
Right?
Right.

1527
01:07:50,050 --> 01:07:50,760
Yeah.
Something.

1528
01:07:51,030 --> 01:07:53,770
They don't shave their fucking pews.
How weird is that?

1529
01:07:54,220 --> 01:07:59,110
I think you're not need the Japanese if 
you're listening out there,

1530
01:07:59,350 --> 01:08:01,780
you guys shaved that thing,
man.

1531
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:03,580
God Damn it.
No one likes that.

1532
01:08:03,690 --> 01:08:07,510
But he would sell so much more porn.
Relatively unherald compared to a lot of

1533
01:08:07,520 --> 01:08:10,690
girls.
Very Japanese are hairless,

1534
01:08:10,691 --> 01:08:12,340
but fuck,
all of a sudden it all,

1535
01:08:12,430 --> 01:08:14,470
you know what it all takes place in the 
pussy.

1536
01:08:14,500 --> 01:08:16,100
They don't have enough hair to

1537
01:08:16,100 --> 01:08:18,110
go around for the legs and the arms and 
shit.

1538
01:08:18,260 --> 01:08:19,280
It all.
Dude.

1539
01:08:19,460 --> 01:08:22,410
You haven't seen Japanese porn?
I have seen a very little shit.

1540
01:08:22,460 --> 01:08:24,650
Do you think the Japanese girls are 
hypersexual?

1541
01:08:25,220 --> 01:08:25,830
Can I,
you know,

1542
01:08:25,831 --> 01:08:27,740
I think redheads are in.
Here's,

1543
01:08:27,780 --> 01:08:28,920
here's why I've been doing some 
research.

1544
01:08:28,950 --> 01:08:31,650
Redheads have thinner skin.
They also are very,

1545
01:08:31,740 --> 01:08:36,610
a lot more sensitive to a lot of things 
like when you get put out as a ginger,

1546
01:08:36,790 --> 01:08:40,440
like you have to have more a shit to put
you out.

1547
01:08:40,850 --> 01:08:42,560
Like they,
they actually have different.

1548
01:08:42,790 --> 01:08:47,790
When you go outside you need sunscreen,
what you're saying would they have 

1549
01:08:47,790 --> 01:08:50,541
thinner skin and they have a few things 
that are different than normal people 

1550
01:08:50,541 --> 01:08:52,140
and so they're like overly sensitive,
like they bruise easier.

1551
01:08:52,700 --> 01:08:57,120
They the sunlight shit,
but there's also like when they're,

1552
01:08:57,130 --> 01:09:01,990
when they're in hospitals they have to 
use more medicine to knock them out too.

1553
01:09:02,850 --> 01:09:03,930
And it's,
it's weird.

1554
01:09:03,931 --> 01:09:07,170
I don't know a bunch of it like,
so you think there are separate species?

1555
01:09:07,230 --> 01:09:08,100
I think they,
they're,

1556
01:09:08,130 --> 01:09:10,530
they're the closest to being different 
than,

1557
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:11,880
than like Asian people.

1558
01:09:12,640 --> 01:09:17,640
Really.
You think that the Asian Asian people 

1559
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:17,700
don't have thinner skin than us?
They don't have.

1560
01:09:17,730 --> 01:09:19,770
They're not more sensitive to skin and 
light.

1561
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:22,960
They also like,
there's a lot of like if you look at red

1562
01:09:22,961 --> 01:09:27,240
heads and that true ginger's compared to
just a regular white person,

1563
01:09:27,241 --> 01:09:32,241
there's a lot of differences that you 
would never even think of for some 

1564
01:09:32,241 --> 01:09:32,241
reason.
Really.

1565
01:09:32,241 --> 01:09:32,241
Yeah.
What else?

1566
01:09:32,241 --> 01:09:34,830
Their eyes are usually more prone to.
They have to wear sunglasses.

1567
01:09:34,840 --> 01:09:39,840
Like it hurts their eyes more than where
they supposed to be from or they like 

1568
01:09:39,840 --> 01:09:42,450
northern people don't know.
I have no idea.

1569
01:09:42,720 --> 01:09:45,750
You know what's crazy about Japan?
I went there about a year ago,

1570
01:09:46,460 --> 01:09:49,200
a year and a half ago this last time,
but they,

1571
01:09:49,350 --> 01:09:54,350
they're so down like they're number one 
obsession as far as girls go.

1572
01:09:55,410 --> 01:09:58,020
Our school girls in the school,
girl outfits,

1573
01:09:58,021 --> 01:09:59,130
you know this.
That's number one,

1574
01:09:59,160 --> 01:10:04,160
but everybody knows that's crazy.
But number two is school girls in French

1575
01:10:04,171 --> 01:10:09,171
maid outfits,
so it's school girl and then French 

1576
01:10:09,171 --> 01:10:09,171
made.
They have a bar out.

1577
01:10:09,171 --> 01:10:12,530
There were 15 year old,
14 year old girls dress up like friends,

1578
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:15,270
like they're in the laundry and they're 
serving ice cream.

1579
01:10:15,660 --> 01:10:18,930
Like it's totally okay in Japan.
It's insane.

1580
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:22,170
Those guys are not.
I'm serious.

1581
01:10:22,380 --> 01:10:27,380
It's crazy.
They're obsessed with school girls and 

1582
01:10:27,380 --> 01:10:29,160
little girls and French maid outfits and
just those two.

1583
01:10:29,660 --> 01:10:30,930
There's not even a third.
It's just,

1584
01:10:31,170 --> 01:10:33,780
are you fucking backstreet boys?
Are you in sync?

1585
01:10:33,930 --> 01:10:35,250
You got to choose sides,
you know,

1586
01:10:35,330 --> 01:10:37,370
and you have to have tentacles coming 
out of you.

1587
01:10:37,430 --> 01:10:40,910
What's all that about?
They got some crazy animals.

1588
01:10:40,920 --> 01:10:43,180
I think it's a loophole to go and get 
around there.

1589
01:10:43,181 --> 01:10:45,530
There are laws of insertion of canvases 
and stuff.

1590
01:10:46,520 --> 01:10:51,380
Crazy cartoons.
Is that pipe before back in the day,

1591
01:10:51,950 --> 01:10:53,660
Roger.
Rabbit kidding me.

1592
01:10:53,870 --> 01:10:56,930
Come on.
Japanese penis porn.

1593
01:10:57,110 --> 01:11:00,440
That's crazy shit dude.
It's like giant digs going through a cig

1594
01:11:00,441 --> 01:11:03,610
and outer mouth and she's gagging and 
slavery is everywhere.

1595
01:11:04,130 --> 01:11:07,880
There's dicks in her hands in each hand.
There's loads going all over the place.

1596
01:11:08,060 --> 01:11:11,010
It's some of the weirdest freaky shit 
you've ever seen.

1597
01:11:11,020 --> 01:11:14,250
You can understand girls getting off to 
it because I knew a girl once who loved

1598
01:11:14,250 --> 01:11:16,620
it,
but I just like cartoons.

1599
01:11:17,070 --> 01:11:22,070
See real shop,
two pluses with all dicks and they're 

1600
01:11:22,070 --> 01:11:24,270
just fucking these crazy school girl 
looking character.

1601
01:11:24,271 --> 01:11:26,200
You know,
like the final fantasy and you know,

1602
01:11:26,290 --> 01:11:27,840
find a fancy.
It's at CGI.

1603
01:11:27,841 --> 01:11:29,100
Where they're trying to make it look 
real.

1604
01:11:29,670 --> 01:11:34,110
What's the best they've done it with in 
porn like that?

1605
01:11:34,500 --> 01:11:35,670
What's the.
Is there anything?

1606
01:11:35,730 --> 01:11:37,980
Yeah,
like it'd be too expensive for porn,

1607
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:42,120
but initiative used special effects for 
like those themed ones.

1608
01:11:42,300 --> 01:11:47,300
Like they had an Avatar theme porn.
I'm sure they must have used some sort 

1609
01:11:47,300 --> 01:11:47,910
of special effects.
The only ones I've seen are like,

1610
01:11:47,960 --> 01:11:52,960
they look totally fake,
but are there any that look almost real 

1611
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:52,960
time.

1612
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:52,980
This is a waste of money,
man.

1613
01:11:52,981 --> 01:11:54,600
Who the hell is and you don't really 
need to.

1614
01:11:54,890 --> 01:11:59,890
I mean,
unless there's someone out there that 

1615
01:11:59,890 --> 01:11:59,890
you remember Salami.
So we had that movie.

1616
01:12:00,260 --> 01:12:00,650
No.
Yeah,

1617
01:12:00,651 --> 01:12:01,730
that's right.
Okay.

1618
01:12:02,750 --> 01:12:05,780
Forgot an inside story will be Salami 
from A.

1619
01:12:05,781 --> 01:12:07,660
From a Jersey guy.
Yeah.

1620
01:12:07,661 --> 01:12:08,960
Yeah.
Bobby up Salami.

1621
01:12:08,961 --> 01:12:13,961
We call them Salami,
but not to be confused with the other 

1622
01:12:13,961 --> 01:12:13,961
Salami.
Oh No,

1623
01:12:13,961 --> 01:12:13,961
no,
no,

1624
01:12:13,961 --> 01:12:13,961
no,
no.

1625
01:12:13,961 --> 01:12:15,740
This is Bobby Salami.
He was a pizza maker.

1626
01:12:15,770 --> 01:12:16,760
Peach mango.
Great Guy.

1627
01:12:19,320 --> 01:12:19,690
People who,

1628
01:12:20,600 --> 01:12:22,330
well make porn.
You know,

1629
01:12:22,331 --> 01:12:22,970
they,
there's,

1630
01:12:23,540 --> 01:12:26,140
there's that wish that they were 
legitimate know I'm in.

1631
01:12:26,470 --> 01:12:31,470
I remember talking to Ron Jeremy a bunch
of times at the comedy store and 

1632
01:12:31,470 --> 01:12:31,640
Robinson was telling me,
yeah,

1633
01:12:31,641 --> 01:12:33,830
I got a part in this thing and I'm 
really excited.

1634
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:35,990
I'm trying to go mainstream.
And I was like,

1635
01:12:35,991 --> 01:12:40,991
you're trying to go mainstream 
mainstream show God damn.

1636
01:12:41,420 --> 01:12:41,870
And I'm like,
Dude,

1637
01:12:41,871 --> 01:12:44,780
you're Ron fucking Jeremy Man.
You're Ron Jeremy.

1638
01:12:45,010 --> 01:12:47,150
Like not a lot of dudes get to be Ron 
Jeremy,

1639
01:12:47,270 --> 01:12:52,270
your ranch.
You're a bad motherfucker and you want 

1640
01:12:52,270 --> 01:12:52,270
to be like one of these regular guys on 
TV.

1641
01:12:52,270 --> 01:12:52,270
Yeah.

1642
01:12:52,270 --> 01:12:54,560
Scan.
And I was right there when you said that

1643
01:12:54,561 --> 01:12:56,540
it was in the parking lot at Hollywood 
and highland.

1644
01:12:56,750 --> 01:13:01,750
And I was uh,
I just wasn't thinking and remember the 

1645
01:13:01,750 --> 01:13:01,750
Dickish.
I mean that was the biggest douche.

1646
01:13:02,140 --> 01:13:04,820
Like when he started saying that it was 
funny to me.

1647
01:13:04,821 --> 01:13:06,350
I'm like,
and I looked at Joe and I'm like,

1648
01:13:06,500 --> 01:13:11,500
can you imagine if it actually works?
And we see like Ron Jeremy doing like 

1649
01:13:11,500 --> 01:13:13,850
diehard five and he's in a,
he's in a wife beater with a gun.

1650
01:13:13,851 --> 01:13:15,590
Someone's breaking in the house.
And I go,

1651
01:13:15,591 --> 01:13:20,591
whew.
Imagine drawn chairman was right there 

1652
01:13:20,591 --> 01:13:20,591
and I started fucking laughing,
jealous,

1653
01:13:20,591 --> 01:13:21,020
like do,
don't laugh.

1654
01:13:21,021 --> 01:13:23,150
I looked at Ron Jeremy,
he's not laughing and I'm like,

1655
01:13:23,240 --> 01:13:26,150
Oh shit.
I just talked to mad shit right in front

1656
01:13:26,151 --> 01:13:26,570
of them.
I was,

1657
01:13:26,790 --> 01:13:27,800
I felt like shit.

1658
01:13:27,910 --> 01:13:32,910
Didn't realize it.
You thought that he would ever sense of 

1659
01:13:32,910 --> 01:13:32,910
humor and that he'd be joking around 
about it.

1660
01:13:32,910 --> 01:13:37,790
Like.
Because if you said that about Brian or 

1661
01:13:37,790 --> 01:13:37,790
if he said that about joey or send above
anybody else.

1662
01:13:37,790 --> 01:13:42,181
So we know you said that about Ari.
Ari would joke around and pretend to be 

1663
01:13:42,181 --> 01:13:45,961
a fucking action hero,
but when you say it about a guy who 

1664
01:13:45,961 --> 01:13:46,870
really wants a legitimate career in 
movies,

1665
01:13:47,330 --> 01:13:49,150
you know,
he was doing something with Roger.

1666
01:13:49,190 --> 01:13:51,260
Avery's like knocking on the door.
Roger Ray.

1667
01:13:51,261 --> 01:13:56,261
We had some sort of a TV show and he was
involved in it right before Roger Avery 

1668
01:13:56,261 --> 01:13:59,030
got arrested for drunk driving.
So he was like in with like,

1669
01:13:59,260 --> 01:14:01,570
he wanted to be a movie star.
What if Ron,

1670
01:14:01,571 --> 01:14:02,830
Jeremy just says,
fuck it,

1671
01:14:03,010 --> 01:14:04,240
you know what?
I'm almost 50,

1672
01:14:04,500 --> 01:14:09,500
whatever the fuck it or whatever.
And then he gets into fucking beasel 

1673
01:14:09,500 --> 01:14:12,040
shape if he got

1674
01:14:12,040 --> 01:14:13,840
into diesel shape,
like you just said,

1675
01:14:13,841 --> 01:14:15,820
fuck it.
That would ruin his whole appeal.

1676
01:14:15,821 --> 01:14:16,690
The whole appeal.
Ron.

1677
01:14:16,691 --> 01:14:20,110
Jeremy,
is it Ron Jeremy's and he's just banging

1678
01:14:20,111 --> 01:14:21,970
the hottest bitches and he'll tell.
He'll tell Ya.

1679
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:23,290
Know Viagra.
I don't use Viagra.

1680
01:14:23,291 --> 01:14:24,700
I don't believe in it.
He will.

1681
01:14:24,710 --> 01:14:25,750
He won't.
He doesn't believe in it.

1682
01:14:25,751 --> 01:14:26,710
Yeah,
he's a savage.

1683
01:14:27,340 --> 01:14:29,860
The steroids have the porn world.
Like everyone denial.

1684
01:14:30,160 --> 01:14:32,240
They're all in denial,
but everybody's doing.

1685
01:14:32,241 --> 01:14:35,650
And do you know that the NFL is trying 
to test for human growth hormone now?

1686
01:14:35,830 --> 01:14:37,460
There was a big thing.
I was watching the.

1687
01:14:37,510 --> 01:14:41,380
I never watched sports shows,
but they were talking to the head guy,

1688
01:14:41,410 --> 01:14:43,930
whoever the fucking head guy the NFL is.
And he's like,

1689
01:14:43,931 --> 01:14:44,830
yeah,
well we had.

1690
01:14:45,130 --> 01:14:50,130
That was a part of the bargaining that 
we're going to test for human growth 

1691
01:14:50,130 --> 01:14:50,290
hormone,
but the players representatives,

1692
01:14:50,291 --> 01:14:50,860
there's still a.

1693
01:14:50,860 --> 01:14:55,860
they're still debating the science,
the science of testing for human growth 

1694
01:14:55,860 --> 01:14:55,860
hormone.
We believe the science is there.

1695
01:14:55,930 --> 01:14:57,820
And like what?
What are you talking about?

1696
01:14:57,970 --> 01:15:00,220
What are you going to have regular sized
people playing football?

1697
01:15:00,280 --> 01:15:04,120
Can you imagine it works and they 
totally get steroids out of NFL.

1698
01:15:04,121 --> 01:15:07,540
It'd be so.
So you could be a 190 pounds and fucking

1699
01:15:07,541 --> 01:15:11,080
play defensive Lineman,
Rocky Marciano roll in his grave,

1700
01:15:11,410 --> 01:15:13,600
189 pound heavyweight champion of the 
world.

1701
01:15:13,660 --> 01:15:15,250
That'd be hope for Mexicans and 
football.

1702
01:15:15,251 --> 01:15:18,130
Right now we have one Mexican.
That'd be a lot of Mexicans,

1703
01:15:18,131 --> 01:15:19,090
man.
Well,

1704
01:15:19,091 --> 01:15:20,110
you know,
look at Mexican,

1705
01:15:20,111 --> 01:15:22,360
like Cain Velasquez.
He's a rare dude.

1706
01:15:22,450 --> 01:15:27,450
You know,
one of the 240 pounds ultra athlete who 

1707
01:15:27,450 --> 01:15:32,100
moves fast.
He fucking moves fast and doubles 

1708
01:15:32,100 --> 01:15:32,100
fastest.
Fuck.

1709
01:15:32,100 --> 01:15:35,080
What if he went to boxing and became the
world heavyweight champion in boxing?

1710
01:15:35,081 --> 01:15:36,250
There's nobody out there.
Oh,

1711
01:15:36,251 --> 01:15:37,090
I bet he could do it.

1712
01:15:37,150 --> 01:15:37,870
Well,
I don't know man,

1713
01:15:37,871 --> 01:15:39,280
if he'd have to deal with the 
Klitschkos,

1714
01:15:39,540 --> 01:15:44,540
you know,
but I think he's one of those guys that 

1715
01:15:44,540 --> 01:15:45,130
there's a few guys with their.
Their mind is so fucking strong.

1716
01:15:45,131 --> 01:15:50,131
Their work ethic is so strong and their 
ability to pull shit off like Cain has 

1717
01:15:50,321 --> 01:15:53,080
got this fucking wicked belief in 
himself.

1718
01:15:53,081 --> 01:15:58,081
Man,
you could see it in that dude's eyes 

1719
01:15:58,081 --> 01:15:58,081
before he goes out there and fights and 
he's got that big ink and head,

1720
01:15:58,081 --> 01:15:59,770
you know what I mean?
And he's a fucking super athlete,

1721
01:15:59,771 --> 01:16:00,310
man.
You know,

1722
01:16:00,311 --> 01:16:01,900
he,
he doesn't look like,

1723
01:16:01,901 --> 01:16:03,330
you know,
your standard super athlete.

1724
01:16:03,430 --> 01:16:08,430
He doesn't have like super low body fat.
He doesn't have like a ridiculous six 

1725
01:16:08,430 --> 01:16:10,060
pack and veins everywhere.
He doesn't look like a Kevin Randleman.

1726
01:16:10,270 --> 01:16:12,970
But that's also one of the reasons why 
the motherfucker never gets tired.

1727
01:16:13,270 --> 01:16:14,560
That guy never gets tired.

1728
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:19,560
He,
no one's got conditioning like Cain 

1729
01:16:19,560 --> 01:16:19,560
Velasquez,
you know,

1730
01:16:19,560 --> 01:16:19,560
I think that God could do anything he 
wants.

1731
01:16:19,560 --> 01:16:20,220
I think we're,
we're,

1732
01:16:20,250 --> 01:16:24,130
we're lucky to have him as a UFC 
heavyweight champion,

1733
01:16:24,310 --> 01:16:26,230
but he would be whatever the fuck you 
wanted to be.

1734
01:16:26,350 --> 01:16:28,420
If he wanted to play football,
he'd be playing football.

1735
01:16:28,421 --> 01:16:33,421
If you wanted to play,
if you want it to be a heavyweight 

1736
01:16:33,421 --> 01:16:35,341
boxer,
he'd be a bad ass fucking heavyweight 

1737
01:16:35,341 --> 01:16:35,341
boxer.
That guy's just,

1738
01:16:35,341 --> 01:16:38,100
he's just a killer.
There's certain dudes that are just 

1739
01:16:38,100 --> 01:16:38,100
killer.
He should do like the cover of espn,

1740
01:16:38,100 --> 01:16:42,630
like in a chill outfit.
It's just rare that Mexicans are taking 

1741
01:16:42,630 --> 01:16:44,110
this ride with it,
go with it.

1742
01:16:44,111 --> 01:16:45,550
With that,
with a baseball cap,

1743
01:16:45,551 --> 01:16:48,250
with the front flipped all the way up 
like a suicidal tendency.

1744
01:16:48,251 --> 01:16:49,360
Dude,
you.

1745
01:16:49,420 --> 01:16:52,360
What do you think about junior dos 
Santos and Cain Velasquez?

1746
01:16:52,810 --> 01:16:55,300
First of all,
I think how amazing it stop for a second

1747
01:16:55,301 --> 01:17:00,301
and think of how many Mexicans are 
fucking bad ass fighters besides me are 

1748
01:17:00,301 --> 01:17:00,520
counting everybody.

1749
01:17:00,760 --> 01:17:04,840
Youtube along with you,
but let's include like the boxers,

1750
01:17:05,020 --> 01:17:10,020
like Julio Cesar Chavez mean what?
That dude epitomized what like a bad ass

1751
01:17:11,241 --> 01:17:16,241
Mexican boxer was.
He would come out to the fucking 

1752
01:17:16,241 --> 01:17:19,001
Mariachi music and he had the flag on 
his fucking head and he would just Jack 

1753
01:17:19,131 --> 01:17:22,010
People.
You know the days of Julio Cesar Chavez?

1754
01:17:22,011 --> 01:17:23,620
Man,
think about all the bad.

1755
01:17:23,670 --> 01:17:28,670
I mean,
it's amazing how many this Victoria t's 

1756
01:17:28,670 --> 01:17:31,190
kid thinking about how many people who 
are bad ass fires or of Mexican descent,

1757
01:17:31,490 --> 01:17:33,170
some amazing numbers.
Man.

1758
01:17:33,610 --> 01:17:35,640
I think it's,
it's Sarah,

1759
01:17:35,870 --> 01:17:40,870
the closest third world,
Latin country to Vegas.

1760
01:17:41,120 --> 01:17:42,350
You know,
it's the closest one.

1761
01:17:42,351 --> 01:17:43,650
You know what I mean?
You know,

1762
01:17:43,700 --> 01:17:45,590
because really Mexicans,
Guatemalans,

1763
01:17:45,650 --> 01:17:48,590
El Salvadorians,
Colombians felt the same shit.

1764
01:17:48,591 --> 01:17:50,000
Come on,
it's all there.

1765
01:17:50,001 --> 01:17:55,001
Just closest.
They're just the closest one in Las 

1766
01:17:55,001 --> 01:17:55,001
Vegas and La.
But you know,

1767
01:17:55,001 --> 01:17:59,410
I'd love Mexico.
I'm Mexican in case you guys were all 

1768
01:17:59,410 --> 01:17:59,830
pissed off,
but you know,

1769
01:17:59,990 --> 01:18:01,610
there's those borders out there.

1770
01:18:01,610 --> 01:18:03,200
It's all the same shit come on.
It is.

1771
01:18:03,201 --> 01:18:08,201
But the Mexicans figured out,
especially in boxing a way to be super 

1772
01:18:08,201 --> 01:18:09,350
fucking successful,
you know,

1773
01:18:09,351 --> 01:18:09,920
I mean,
you,

1774
01:18:09,921 --> 01:18:11,420
you,
you can't discount,

1775
01:18:11,660 --> 01:18:13,540
you know,
just say it's just all,

1776
01:18:13,550 --> 01:18:18,550
it's all the same shit because Mexicans 
in particular have been really 

1777
01:18:18,550 --> 01:18:18,860
successful at boxing.
You know,

1778
01:18:18,861 --> 01:18:19,420
they,
they've,

1779
01:18:19,450 --> 01:18:24,450
they've brought up some incredible 
boxers out of Mexico and they have the 

1780
01:18:24,450 --> 01:18:27,020
most loyal fans.
The Mexican fans are fucking not nuts.

1781
01:18:27,021 --> 01:18:29,570
Erik Morales.
And when that dude was on top,

1782
01:18:29,980 --> 01:18:34,980
God damn they go for the most Mexican 
tick is when Julio Cesar Chavez was at 

1783
01:18:34,980 --> 01:18:36,230
his prime when he fought Oscar de la 
Hoya.

1784
01:18:36,231 --> 01:18:41,231
Well,
he was actually falling off as a little 

1785
01:18:41,231 --> 01:18:42,410
bit and Oscar Delgado is rising.
You had to choose a side you want.

1786
01:18:42,500 --> 01:18:45,260
They all went with the most Mexican and 
the Mexican Julio,

1787
01:18:45,261 --> 01:18:50,261
Cesar Chavez.
He couldn't even speak a word of 

1788
01:18:50,261 --> 01:18:50,261
English.

1789
01:18:50,261 --> 01:18:50,261
He was a beast.
Yeah,

1790
01:18:50,261 --> 01:18:53,650
he was a fucking beast.
He would just body punch the fucking 

1791
01:18:53,650 --> 01:18:54,860
shit out of you who just stay on top of 
you until you eventually just broke you.

1792
01:18:55,120 --> 01:18:58,580
I was a giant boxing fan before the UFC.
I was like,

1793
01:18:58,770 --> 01:19:03,770
I was just a fanatic with boxing because
I was for mma and UFC and I loved them 

1794
01:19:04,301 --> 01:19:05,510
both.
I saw Oscar de la Hoya,

1795
01:19:05,511 --> 01:19:08,210
his first pro fight at the La Forum.
I was a huge fan,

1796
01:19:08,211 --> 01:19:10,250
but I had to make a choice.
Fuck,

1797
01:19:10,280 --> 01:19:11,600
I chose.
I chose Julio.

1798
01:19:11,601 --> 01:19:14,570
Cesar Chavez.
I went to see a Berrera fight live.

1799
01:19:14,571 --> 01:19:17,450
I saw him fight live.
It was in la somewhere.

1800
01:19:17,510 --> 01:19:22,510
I want to say it's a stable center,
but it might've been before the staples 

1801
01:19:22,510 --> 01:19:22,510
center even existed.
I don't know where the fuck I saw him,

1802
01:19:22,510 --> 01:19:24,980
but uh,
I saw him fight some other dudes,

1803
01:19:24,981 --> 01:19:26,270
some black dude that was pretty good.

1804
01:19:26,270 --> 01:19:29,780
But Berrera beat his ass and he,
we were all hanging out with Mexicans.

1805
01:19:29,781 --> 01:19:34,781
It's me and my friend Terry clay bond as
a boxing coach and we're all watching 

1806
01:19:34,781 --> 01:19:38,291
this date.
They were going fucking bananas when 

1807
01:19:38,291 --> 01:19:39,650
Barrera was going off.
They were going fucking bananas.

1808
01:19:39,670 --> 01:19:44,670
It's boxing is.
That's when the racism just fucking 

1809
01:19:44,670 --> 01:19:46,160
comes out and it's okay.
It's okay to be racist if there's boxing

1810
01:19:46,161 --> 01:19:49,460
going on because when I met anytime of 
Mexican fought,

1811
01:19:49,490 --> 01:19:52,220
anybody else I was.
I always went for the Mexican.

1812
01:19:52,280 --> 01:19:55,790
Even if it wasn't Mexican,
if he was Honduran and he was fighting a

1813
01:19:55,791 --> 01:19:57,680
white guy,
I'm going with a Latin guy.

1814
01:19:57,681 --> 01:19:59,450
That's the closest thing to Mexico.
I was.

1815
01:19:59,540 --> 01:20:01,550
It was okay with my best friend growing 
up.

1816
01:20:01,551 --> 01:20:02,480
James.
He was black.

1817
01:20:02,481 --> 01:20:05,390
We were both into boxing.
He always went for the black guy.

1818
01:20:05,450 --> 01:20:07,470
I always went for the Mexican guy,
always.

1819
01:20:07,470 --> 01:20:10,830
He never went for the Mexican guy and I 
went for the black guy that would and it

1820
01:20:10,831 --> 01:20:11,910
was okay.
It was,

1821
01:20:12,150 --> 01:20:15,210
but NMA job.
Totally different.

1822
01:20:15,211 --> 01:20:18,940
I can in MMA,
I can care less if the guys Mexican,

1823
01:20:18,941 --> 01:20:22,230
what I like.
Style style is way thicker than blood.

1824
01:20:22,410 --> 01:20:24,570
I'm a Jujitsu guy.
I'm always going.

1825
01:20:24,571 --> 01:20:26,790
I'm always pulling for the Jujitsu guys,
always.

1826
01:20:26,990 --> 01:20:31,990
I don't care if it's a black Jujitsu guy
against a kick boxer from Mexico from 

1827
01:20:31,990 --> 01:20:33,470
where my mom was born.
Like,

1828
01:20:33,630 --> 01:20:36,500
fuck you,
I'm going for the Black Jujitsu guy.

1829
01:20:36,900 --> 01:20:41,900
It's always Jujitsu style.
You have to think that your Jujitsu 

1830
01:20:41,900 --> 01:20:43,230
instructor,
it's styles way thicker than blood,

1831
01:20:43,231 --> 01:20:48,231
but boxing shit is.
A lot of people think that I pulled for 

1832
01:20:48,231 --> 01:20:48,231
Jujitsu guys,
man,

1833
01:20:48,231 --> 01:20:48,900
but most of my favorite fighters are 
strikers.

1834
01:20:49,200 --> 01:20:54,200
You know,
I pull for a pool for extra 

1835
01:20:54,210 --> 01:20:56,160
extraordinary talent.
That's what I pulled for.

1836
01:20:56,160 --> 01:20:58,360
I don't pull for like individuals,
you know,

1837
01:20:58,400 --> 01:20:59,130
I pull,
I want to.

1838
01:20:59,220 --> 01:21:01,020
I want to see some crazy shit.
You know?

1839
01:21:01,021 --> 01:21:05,010
Even if it's a guy who I thought was 
really good before,

1840
01:21:05,160 --> 01:21:06,780
then all of a sudden they pull something
off.

1841
01:21:06,781 --> 01:21:08,640
It's amazing.
It makes you look at them differently.

1842
01:21:08,641 --> 01:21:10,530
That's what my,
that's my favorite shit.

1843
01:21:10,531 --> 01:21:15,531
I like watching two guys push it off.
I just watched like watching guys 

1844
01:21:15,531 --> 01:21:16,530
improve.
Guys that are really good.

1845
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:20,550
You know,
I like just the best submission guys.

1846
01:21:20,700 --> 01:21:23,610
Those are always my friend Aoki.
He's always like that too.

1847
01:21:23,611 --> 01:21:26,290
But I still like watching Anderson man.
I like watching it.

1848
01:21:26,460 --> 01:21:27,900
You can't deny that.
I definitely.

1849
01:21:27,901 --> 01:21:31,020
I love knockouts.
Who Doesn't love a great knockout.

1850
01:21:31,140 --> 01:21:36,140
I love that shit too.
But I'm always pulling for cool new 

1851
01:21:36,140 --> 01:21:38,250
submissions because there's so much room
for improvement and Jitsu and mma.

1852
01:21:38,251 --> 01:21:39,180
There's so much room.

1853
01:21:39,180 --> 01:21:41,340
It's still at its infancy.
You know,

1854
01:21:41,370 --> 01:21:45,270
there's something special to me.
I mean it's sounds kind of fucked up,

1855
01:21:45,271 --> 01:21:50,271
but there's something special to me when
a guy has reached the extraordinary 

1856
01:21:50,271 --> 01:21:54,411
heights that like Anderson Silva has 
that word and he's standing right in 

1857
01:21:54,411 --> 01:21:54,740
front of you.
Chanel calming,

1858
01:21:54,760 --> 01:21:56,700
standing right in front of him with his 
hands down,

1859
01:21:56,850 --> 01:21:59,460
his fist balled up,
and you just realize like,

1860
01:21:59,461 --> 01:22:04,461
this poor fucking mouse is in a box with
a Cobra and it's going to get jacked up.

1861
01:22:04,830 --> 01:22:09,830
It's going to get jacked.
You realize that you was trapped in 

1862
01:22:09,830 --> 01:22:09,960
there with Anderson Silva.
It wasn't.

1863
01:22:09,990 --> 01:22:14,990
He was no longer competitive.
There was a moment after he had kicked 

1864
01:22:14,990 --> 01:22:15,780
him at the end of the first round,
he fucking blasting and with a headache.

1865
01:22:15,960 --> 01:22:18,360
And from that moment on you,
she was not competitive.

1866
01:22:18,480 --> 01:22:20,400
He was,
Anderson knew it too.

1867
01:22:20,550 --> 01:22:22,680
There's no way you take one of those 
head kicks and be okay.

1868
01:22:22,860 --> 01:22:24,660
I mean you might look okay,
you fall down,

1869
01:22:24,661 --> 01:22:26,040
you get back up,
you look okay,

1870
01:22:26,250 --> 01:22:28,770
but your shit is done.
You know,

1871
01:22:28,780 --> 01:22:33,780
Anderson just got in front of them and 
started moving around on him and it was 

1872
01:22:33,780 --> 01:22:35,400
just when you watch someone have that 
skill level,

1873
01:22:35,401 --> 01:22:36,900
man,
I don't care what they're doing,

1874
01:22:36,901 --> 01:22:39,090
if they're doing boxing,
if they're doing Jujitsu,

1875
01:22:39,091 --> 01:22:40,850
if they're just kickboxing.
I just,

1876
01:22:40,860 --> 01:22:45,860
that's what I like.
I like watching someone is just hitting 

1877
01:22:45,860 --> 01:22:47,370
those rare heights.
How about t j grant pulling guard with a

1878
01:22:47,371 --> 01:22:52,371
good team.
Dude pops his head out and switches to 

1879
01:22:52,371 --> 01:22:52,371
that beautiful and oh,
it was amazing.

1880
01:22:52,371 --> 01:22:53,610
Even though there's controversy,
you know,

1881
01:22:53,611 --> 01:22:54,150
that he,
you know,

1882
01:22:54,151 --> 01:22:56,430
he didn't tap it all that.
There's some controversy there though.

1883
01:22:56,431 --> 01:23:01,431
But the fact that tj grant was so 
confident in his guard that he pulled 

1884
01:23:01,431 --> 01:23:06,351
guard with a good team because a lot of 
guys don't like pulling guard with a 

1885
01:23:06,351 --> 01:23:06,351
good thing because if,
if the guy pops his

1886
01:23:06,351 --> 01:23:06,760
head out and,
and,

1887
01:23:06,780 --> 01:23:09,550
and he gets out of the good,
oh you're on your back and he's on top.

1888
01:23:09,940 --> 01:23:14,940
But when clearly did it in a sequence,
the guy was defending with his left arm 

1889
01:23:14,940 --> 01:23:15,520
and he knew he was going to get that 
arm.

1890
01:23:15,790 --> 01:23:17,770
He knew it.
And as the guys defending shit,

1891
01:23:17,800 --> 01:23:20,710
it lets it go and goes to the arm bar.
He was so confident of.

1892
01:23:21,030 --> 01:23:24,880
So few fighters are.
They're just not confident I'll fighting

1893
01:23:24,881 --> 01:23:25,950
off their backs.
You know,

1894
01:23:25,960 --> 01:23:29,890
there's so many Brazilian black belts 
out there moon our champion too.

1895
01:23:30,310 --> 01:23:33,220
They just refused to pull guard.
They don't,

1896
01:23:33,250 --> 01:23:35,060
they don't feel like,
you know,

1897
01:23:35,710 --> 01:23:40,710
I don't know what they're thinking,
but to me it just seems like they don't 

1898
01:23:40,710 --> 01:23:41,920
have enough confidence in the guard had 
been doing Jujitsu for a long time.

1899
01:23:41,921 --> 01:23:44,130
And it's refreshing to see someone like 
Tj grants.

1900
01:23:44,140 --> 01:23:44,830
Like,
you know what?

1901
01:23:44,830 --> 01:23:47,980
I'm having trouble taking this guy down.
Let me just pull guard and attack off my

1902
01:23:47,981 --> 01:23:48,400
back.
Well,

1903
01:23:48,401 --> 01:23:50,270
he almost got him with an arm bar and 
the,

1904
01:23:50,280 --> 01:23:55,280
uh,
the first round he had locked up an arm 

1905
01:23:55,280 --> 01:23:55,600
bar and went belly down at the very last
second.

1906
01:23:55,601 --> 01:24:00,601
So the first roundup,
he's a beast man at one thing that kids 

1907
01:24:00,601 --> 01:24:02,330
a killer t j grant.
I knew he was talented when I first used

1908
01:24:02,410 --> 01:24:06,310
fought real tony and his UFC debut.
That's a tough fight for UFC debut.

1909
01:24:06,640 --> 01:24:08,110
Anyone want a decision?
I'm like,

1910
01:24:08,111 --> 01:24:10,360
this fucking kids.
How about Paul Sas?

1911
01:24:10,420 --> 01:24:13,150
He hasn't fought in like a year and he's
like,

1912
01:24:13,510 --> 01:24:18,510
the first I've ever heard of Paul Sassy 
was finding on the undercard in an 

1913
01:24:18,510 --> 01:24:21,751
England show over a year ago.
And it was a headline on the underground

1914
01:24:21,971 --> 01:24:24,580
and said the headline was I'd like to 
fall up,

1915
01:24:24,581 --> 01:24:25,780
fight off my back.
I'm like,

1916
01:24:25,781 --> 01:24:29,350
you never have seen that as a headline 
for a fighter in some interview.

1917
01:24:29,350 --> 01:24:32,080
I liked to fight off.
My back is so dangerous.

1918
01:24:32,090 --> 01:24:33,550
Offers back.
And then I'm like,

1919
01:24:33,551 --> 01:24:34,900
wow,
let me watch this guy.

1920
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:36,340
I go,
this guy pulls guard.

1921
01:24:36,341 --> 01:24:40,000
So his in the fight a year and a half 
ago in England,

1922
01:24:40,060 --> 01:24:41,890
he pulled,
he shoots,

1923
01:24:41,891 --> 01:24:42,670
pulls,
guard,

1924
01:24:42,760 --> 01:24:44,530
attacks off his back.
The guy stands up,

1925
01:24:44,531 --> 01:24:45,520
pulls away,
runs away.

1926
01:24:45,521 --> 01:24:48,790
They stand up again still first round,
he shoots deep,

1927
01:24:48,910 --> 01:24:50,410
makes the guy sprawl,
pulls guard,

1928
01:24:50,411 --> 01:24:55,411
attack some.
The guy pulls out of Inova bladder or 

1929
01:24:55,411 --> 01:24:55,411
triangle.
They go again.

1930
01:24:55,411 --> 01:24:55,540
Third time he shoots,
pulls,

1931
01:24:55,541 --> 01:24:56,920
guard,
goes after like a leg lock.

1932
01:24:56,921 --> 01:24:58,000
He just misses it.
Bam.

1933
01:24:58,001 --> 01:25:00,550
Or something like that.
Instill in the first round.

1934
01:25:00,580 --> 01:25:05,190
He shot again for a fourth time shot the
dude sprawled.

1935
01:25:05,200 --> 01:25:10,200
He pulled guard and then he got them.
He got them like there's a guy out there

1936
01:25:10,751 --> 01:25:15,751
named Paul Sas who so confident on 
fighting his back and he's people don't 

1937
01:25:15,751 --> 01:25:17,740
want anything to do with his guard.

1938
01:25:17,740 --> 01:25:19,480
He sits on his ass and says,
come on,

1939
01:25:19,481 --> 01:25:20,770
get on top.
I'm spotting you.

1940
01:25:20,771 --> 01:25:21,820
I'm good.
I'm spotting.

1941
01:25:21,821 --> 01:25:24,880
You guys will refuse to get in his 
guard.

1942
01:25:25,090 --> 01:25:25,870
You would think.
They're like,

1943
01:25:25,871 --> 01:25:27,340
damn,
this guy is going to go on his back.

1944
01:25:27,341 --> 01:25:28,930
I'm just gonna.
Go on top and just mash them.

1945
01:25:28,931 --> 01:25:31,720
I can't believe he's just submitting and
just going on his back.

1946
01:25:31,900 --> 01:25:36,900
His guard is so dangerous guys.
The hard part is getting guys to agree 

1947
01:25:36,900 --> 01:25:38,770
to get into his guard.
That's unique.

1948
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:41,410
That's fascinating to me.
I love seeing that.

1949
01:25:41,411 --> 01:25:43,300
Paul says,
Tj Grant,

1950
01:25:43,780 --> 01:25:46,140
man,
I'm huge fans of those guys.

1951
01:25:46,141 --> 01:25:51,141
Well,
what what it is is that people are 

1952
01:25:51,141 --> 01:25:52,921
realizing that there's a level that's 
possible to achieve that hasn't been 

1953
01:25:52,921 --> 01:25:57,001
demonstrated yet and there's a lot of 
those people in straight Jujitsu and 

1954
01:25:57,001 --> 01:25:58,420
there's a lot of those people in the 
street submission grappling,

1955
01:25:58,421 --> 01:26:01,810
but in an mma when you add in all the 
other things,

1956
01:26:01,930 --> 01:26:03,860
we haven't seen anybody pull it off.

1957
01:26:04,220 --> 01:26:09,220
We haven't ever ever seen like the way 
Marcello Garcia went through all those 

1958
01:26:09,220 --> 01:26:12,280
competitors in Abu Dhabi in 2003 when we
first saw Marcello in person.

1959
01:26:12,490 --> 01:26:15,110
I'll be like,
this guy is like a speed demon.

1960
01:26:15,111 --> 01:26:20,111
The way he was going through people like
the banality to his technique was so 

1961
01:26:20,111 --> 01:26:20,500
clean.
Yeah,

1962
01:26:20,540 --> 01:26:21,950
but that's.
You know,

1963
01:26:22,040 --> 01:26:27,040
it's a different world when you add in 
wrestling and when you add in punching 

1964
01:26:27,040 --> 01:26:28,910
and you had a nice and kicks and this is
a different world.

1965
01:26:28,970 --> 01:26:32,140
We haven't quite seen someone hit those 
heights of submission.

1966
01:26:32,210 --> 01:26:33,920
We're starting to see it though.
There are.

1967
01:26:33,950 --> 01:26:38,950
There are a handful of fighters that 
have zero problem pulling guard and 

1968
01:26:39,141 --> 01:26:41,880
Vinny Maga classes.
One he used to fight in the UFC.

1969
01:26:41,881 --> 01:26:45,680
He wasn't one of the seasons of tough.
He pulls guard like he doesn't mind.

1970
01:26:45,860 --> 01:26:50,860
His guard is so dangerous that he will 
pull garden and attack you and you know 

1971
01:26:50,860 --> 01:26:51,000
that again,
there's Paul Sassy.

1972
01:26:51,080 --> 01:26:53,930
Paul South fought last week.
He did the exact same thing.

1973
01:26:53,931 --> 01:26:57,620
He pulled guard guy pulled out of an arm
bar or a triangle and then you switch it

1974
01:26:57,621 --> 01:26:59,550
to a leg lock.
It was a beautiful leg lock.

1975
01:26:59,551 --> 01:27:04,551
So um,
and then like Aoki will pull guard 

1976
01:27:04,551 --> 01:27:05,210
anytime.
But you see Matt Wyman and Mac Dancer.

1977
01:27:05,450 --> 01:27:06,440
That was amazing.
I had,

1978
01:27:06,441 --> 01:27:09,520
why am I got Mac dancing and a fucking 
serious arm bar.

1979
01:27:09,860 --> 01:27:11,570
He didn't tap him,
but I'm like whoa.

1980
01:27:11,720 --> 01:27:14,930
That was quick.
He had hit a nice arm bar for his back.

1981
01:27:14,931 --> 01:27:16,910
If Mac Danzig didn't have such good 
defense,

1982
01:27:17,030 --> 01:27:22,030
he woulda got that.
We're starting to see more and more 

1983
01:27:22,030 --> 01:27:23,360
fighters beat active once they get put 
on their back,

1984
01:27:23,361 --> 01:27:26,300
like if they got put on their back and 
they didn't want to be there.

1985
01:27:26,301 --> 01:27:28,670
Like Miguel Torres,
if he gets put on his back,

1986
01:27:28,700 --> 01:27:30,560
he will attack.
You just not going to sit there.

1987
01:27:30,590 --> 01:27:32,960
Havi Vasquez.
He's just not going to sit there.

1988
01:27:33,050 --> 01:27:35,170
He says he's going to attack you.
And then the,

1989
01:27:35,450 --> 01:27:36,980
you know,
and then you got guys like,

1990
01:27:36,981 --> 01:27:37,680
uh,
you know,

1991
01:27:37,820 --> 01:27:41,240
rumble Johnson who wants to be on top of
rumble.

1992
01:27:41,241 --> 01:27:44,480
Johnson had a guard to rumbled,
Johnson's frightening.

1993
01:27:44,560 --> 01:27:45,980
And you see that fight with Charlie 
Brennan.

1994
01:27:46,460 --> 01:27:48,740
He's terrifying.
His eyes look orange.

1995
01:27:48,940 --> 01:27:51,740
I wonder if he's wearing contacts.
He's had surgery on his eyes.

1996
01:27:51,880 --> 01:27:53,060
Is that what it is?
Poked.

1997
01:27:53,090 --> 01:27:58,090
He got poked really bad by Kevin Burns.
Remember Kevin Burns could not close his

1998
01:27:58,161 --> 01:28:03,161
lefthand.
Kevin Burns broke his left hand so many 

1999
01:28:03,161 --> 01:28:03,161
times that he literally couldn't close 
it.

2000
01:28:03,161 --> 01:28:07,450
So he would like Paul with his left and 
then throw his right and he poked the 

2001
01:28:07,450 --> 01:28:10,790
fucking shit out of his eyes.
Anthony Johnson's a Jesus.

2002
01:28:10,820 --> 01:28:12,490
He's scary.
He's a,

2003
01:28:12,560 --> 01:28:14,480
he's a true super athlete.
You know,

2004
01:28:14,481 --> 01:28:19,481
he's a,
first of all the idea that that guy can 

2005
01:28:19,481 --> 01:28:19,481
get the 70.

2006
01:28:19,481 --> 01:28:21,530
It's like it defies logic defies.
It defies reason.

2007
01:28:21,560 --> 01:28:22,670
You know,
you look at them and you go,

2008
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:25,190
you see them in between fights.
Like that's a heavyweight,

2009
01:28:25,400 --> 01:28:28,370
that's a goddamn heavyweight.
And then somehow or another it makes one

2010
01:28:28,380 --> 01:28:33,380
70 and he looks fucking great the day of
whatever he's doing and he's doing it 

2011
01:28:33,380 --> 01:28:33,380
right.
You know,

2012
01:28:33,380 --> 01:28:35,800
I just wonder if it takes so much out of
him that it would.

2013
01:28:35,810 --> 01:28:37,790
I mean,
I think what he does at one 70,

2014
01:28:37,791 --> 01:28:42,791
he could probably do it one 85 to.
I think he might even feel better if it 

2015
01:28:42,791 --> 01:28:44,060
was doing it at 1:35,
you might feel healthier.

2016
01:28:44,270 --> 01:28:44,610
You know,
I,

2017
01:28:44,620 --> 01:28:49,620
I don't know.
I mean I'm only just taking wild stabs 

2018
01:28:49,620 --> 01:28:52,961
at it.
[inaudible] I don't think it's so good 

2019
01:28:52,961 --> 01:28:52,961
to cut that much weight for so long.
I think it's terrible for your body,

2020
01:28:52,961 --> 01:28:54,350
but whatever the fuck he's doing,
man,

2021
01:28:54,590 --> 01:28:55,980
when he gets in there,
man,

2022
01:28:56,140 --> 01:28:58,490
very few guys move as quick as that guy 
does.

2023
01:28:58,700 --> 01:29:00,020
Very few guys,
when he's like,

2024
01:29:00,050 --> 01:29:02,310
when we were siting Charlie Brennan,
you know,

2025
01:29:02,311 --> 01:29:04,380
he didn't respect Brennaman standup that
much.

2026
01:29:04,381 --> 01:29:09,381
She was worried about his wrestling,
but he knew that he had a big standup 

2027
01:29:09,381 --> 01:29:12,141
advantage.
You could tell he was in the confidence 

2028
01:29:12,141 --> 01:29:12,141
that he had when he moved forward and I 
was watching.

2029
01:29:12,141 --> 01:29:12,450
I was like,
that is terrifying.

2030
01:29:12,780 --> 01:29:14,460
That guy,
when he's confident,

2031
01:29:14,461 --> 01:29:16,560
when he's confident and he's.
He's real,

2032
01:29:16,770 --> 01:29:21,770
real short is going to tag you.
Like he was the finals of tough when he 

2033
01:29:21,770 --> 01:29:25,071
fought that Tommy spirits kid,
when he's real confident that his 

2034
01:29:25,071 --> 01:29:25,470
standup is way better than you.
He's so dangerous.

2035
01:29:25,620 --> 01:29:29,720
He's one of the scariest guys at one 70.
Even scarier than Tiago thiago.

2036
01:29:29,721 --> 01:29:31,740
Alves is probably the best technical 
striker,

2037
01:29:31,920 --> 01:29:33,510
but Anthony Johnson,
when he gets you hurt,

2038
01:29:33,511 --> 01:29:36,120
he's the scariest guy.
He's a scariest.

2039
01:29:36,290 --> 01:29:41,290
He's,
I think he's got like a gnarly 

2040
01:29:41,290 --> 01:29:41,290
potential.

2041
01:29:41,290 --> 01:29:41,290
You know,
I think what you've seen now,

2042
01:29:41,290 --> 01:29:42,360
it's like,
that guy's going to get better.

2043
01:29:42,480 --> 01:29:44,370
He's getting better already.
He's just,

2044
01:29:44,460 --> 01:29:47,550
he's just a freak,
fucking awesome athlete.

2045
01:29:47,760 --> 01:29:49,350
You know,
that's racialist.

2046
01:29:49,740 --> 01:29:50,910
No,
that's just reality,

2047
01:29:50,911 --> 01:29:51,600
man.
If he was white,

2048
01:29:51,601 --> 01:29:54,060
I'd say the same goddamn thing.
Whatever he's doing,

2049
01:29:54,090 --> 01:29:55,680
he's doing awesome.
I mean there's,

2050
01:29:56,070 --> 01:29:58,560
you know,
it's hard work and discipline for sure.

2051
01:29:58,590 --> 01:30:03,060
Go into all any recipe for success.
But that guy is a,

2052
01:30:03,090 --> 01:30:04,310
he's a special athlete.
He's,

2053
01:30:04,500 --> 01:30:06,510
he's built the fuck people up.
You know,

2054
01:30:06,511 --> 01:30:08,190
this is a good sport for him.
You know,

2055
01:30:08,191 --> 01:30:13,191
there's certain guys like John Jones 
always says that he can't fucking throw 

2056
01:30:13,191 --> 01:30:13,260
a football.
He's not,

2057
01:30:13,470 --> 01:30:15,360
he's not good at basketball.
You can't dunk,

2058
01:30:15,720 --> 01:30:19,050
but Goddamn as he designed perfect for 
mma,

2059
01:30:19,380 --> 01:30:24,380
you know,
Jon Jones has the literally the perfect 

2060
01:30:24,380 --> 01:30:24,380
frame.
You know,

2061
01:30:24,380 --> 01:30:28,140
that that's the.
If you look at all the people that are 

2062
01:30:28,140 --> 01:30:28,140
fighting right now and all the different
equations,

2063
01:30:28,140 --> 01:30:29,610
you know,
how would you get to this guy?

2064
01:30:29,610 --> 01:30:31,370
How would you beat that guy?
What are you going to do?

2065
01:30:31,630 --> 01:30:32,870
You get to John Jones,
you go,

2066
01:30:32,940 --> 01:30:34,290
damn,
good luck.

2067
01:30:34,590 --> 01:30:38,250
And I love the fact that the navy,
and I'm not a striker,

2068
01:30:38,251 --> 01:30:39,560
like I said,
I'm a fan of striking.

2069
01:30:39,570 --> 01:30:42,120
It was a big boxing fan.
I love that.

2070
01:30:42,121 --> 01:30:47,121
More and more fighters are starting to 
implement taekwondo and Kung Fu kinks.

2071
01:30:47,911 --> 01:30:49,250
I love that.
You know,

2072
01:30:49,260 --> 01:30:51,870
and guys like John Jones and Anderson 
Silva,

2073
01:30:51,900 --> 01:30:55,020
they're doing Kung Fu there.
They're throwing wing Chung kicks,

2074
01:30:55,260 --> 01:30:59,850
that taekwondo kicks and that one got 45
does it.

2075
01:30:59,851 --> 01:31:03,240
Dustin Dennis,
the guy was just an awesome kicker.

2076
01:31:04,170 --> 01:31:07,890
Dustin Dennis Doonas,
I'm sure.

2077
01:31:08,730 --> 01:31:09,990
Yeah,
he's at 45.

2078
01:31:10,020 --> 01:31:14,550
He fought hoodie fine.
He Find Florian.

2079
01:31:14,580 --> 01:31:15,990
Kenny Florian.
Oh,

2080
01:31:15,991 --> 01:31:20,610
Diego Nunez.
Diego knew he's a sales guy.

2081
01:31:20,680 --> 01:31:22,620
Watch him over one young guy.
Yeah.

2082
01:31:22,621 --> 01:31:27,621
That guy can kick.
He's got great kick Nova and Y'all guys 

2083
01:31:27,621 --> 01:31:28,950
married.
A lot of those guys are wicked kickers.

2084
01:31:28,950 --> 01:31:33,950
I would say a good 80 percent,
85 percent of of MMA fighters today are 

2085
01:31:35,221 --> 01:31:37,170
just throwing the basic,
you know,

2086
01:31:37,210 --> 01:31:40,440
tight leg kick and then a head kick.
Occasionally.

2087
01:31:40,441 --> 01:31:44,140
Maybe a spinning back kick or something.
I love guys to just throw it all,

2088
01:31:44,190 --> 01:31:44,940
throw it all.
Well,

2089
01:31:44,941 --> 01:31:48,610
usually those guys have a taekwondo or 
karate background because in in,

2090
01:31:48,670 --> 01:31:50,550
in normal mma training,
man,

2091
01:31:50,551 --> 01:31:55,551
it's way harder to teach someone how to 
throw a sidekick then as how to teach 

2092
01:31:55,551 --> 01:31:55,551
them and throw a round kick.
Yeah.

2093
01:31:55,551 --> 01:32:00,110
I could teach you to throw a low kick 
and throw it correctly in a couple of 

2094
01:32:00,110 --> 01:32:02,140
and in any normal athlete football 
player,

2095
01:32:02,150 --> 01:32:04,330
a baseball player,
any normal athlete can perform that,

2096
01:32:04,570 --> 01:32:06,400
but if I say or I do a,
we'll kick.

2097
01:32:06,430 --> 01:32:09,490
I want you to do a.
we'll kick with power like Jesus Christ.

2098
01:32:09,491 --> 01:32:12,640
That takes a long time to learn it.
If you're.

2099
01:32:12,640 --> 01:32:14,170
Even.
If you're a super athlete,

2100
01:32:14,171 --> 01:32:17,200
it's going to take a while to pick up.
Let Jon Jones is throwing it.

2101
01:32:17,460 --> 01:32:18,770
Well,
of course with John Jones,

2102
01:32:18,940 --> 01:32:23,940
he's training for quite awhile now.
What I'm saying is it's like it's not 

2103
01:32:23,940 --> 01:32:25,360
easy to pick up those certain techniques
like sidekicks.

2104
01:32:25,390 --> 01:32:27,820
That's the.
John's got a wicked sidekick now too,

2105
01:32:27,821 --> 01:32:28,720
man.
It's got a front leg.

2106
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:31,690
Scientificky hops forward to he.
He was throwing,

2107
01:32:31,691 --> 01:32:33,210
Spinning back X.
He.

2108
01:32:33,270 --> 01:32:36,910
He threw a hopping sidekick against the 
cage and they'll just a warm up.

2109
01:32:36,911 --> 01:32:38,110
Like I was using warming up and I'm 
like,

2110
01:32:38,111 --> 01:32:40,120
Whoa,
he's doing it perfectly.

2111
01:32:40,140 --> 01:32:42,220
Knee up high,
turning the hip.

2112
01:32:42,530 --> 01:32:44,740
[inaudible] pretty much proved that you 
know,

2113
01:32:44,960 --> 01:32:49,960
all of those Kung Fu kicks or to work 
Connolly's got the best threesixty 

2114
01:32:50,410 --> 01:32:52,300
turning side kick in the game,
you know,

2115
01:32:52,301 --> 01:32:57,301
and that's one of his sidekicks or one 
of the things that makes his fight with 

2116
01:32:57,301 --> 01:33:01,050
vandelay so interesting because when 
American kickboxer started fighting tie 

2117
01:33:01,050 --> 01:33:02,160
fighters,
they found two things out.

2118
01:33:02,160 --> 01:33:04,930
The one they found out how difficult it 
is to deal with leg kicks.

2119
01:33:04,931 --> 01:33:06,760
They were getting fucked up by leg 
kicks,

2120
01:33:07,060 --> 01:33:10,610
but guys like Don Wilson,
who was a he,

2121
01:33:10,611 --> 01:33:14,200
he learned leg kicks early on and he 
fought a lot of leg kick fights.

2122
01:33:14,350 --> 01:33:17,800
He realized how good the front leg side 
kick was.

2123
01:33:17,801 --> 01:33:20,190
The front leg roundhouse kick it kicks 
it.

2124
01:33:20,191 --> 01:33:22,870
The ties weren't that good at ties would
throw the team,

2125
01:33:23,050 --> 01:33:24,340
but they would get close enough to each 
other.

2126
01:33:24,341 --> 01:33:27,550
Jack each other's legs.
And when you fight that style,

2127
01:33:27,551 --> 01:33:32,551
where you kick the legs,
you don't necessarily develop the 

2128
01:33:32,551 --> 01:33:33,250
techniques like the karate techniques,
because the chronic techniques,

2129
01:33:33,251 --> 01:33:35,260
a lot of them,
when you're coming up through the ranks,

2130
01:33:35,380 --> 01:33:40,380
they kind of get shut down.
But you know by a lot of the Thai 

2131
01:33:40,380 --> 01:33:41,200
techniques.
But if you learn karate before you learn

2132
01:33:41,201 --> 01:33:46,201
more tie,
then you have all that crazy dexterity 

2133
01:33:46,201 --> 01:33:46,480
for acs kicks,
we'll kicks and all that shit.

2134
01:33:46,480 --> 01:33:51,480
That may be one work as well.
If guys were kicking your legs so you 

2135
01:33:51,480 --> 01:33:51,970
might have a more conservative game.
You know,

2136
01:33:51,980 --> 01:33:53,860
some guys that come up through the 
taekwondo ranks,

2137
01:33:53,870 --> 01:33:57,070
those are the ones who do wild,
crazy shit because you can't get punched

2138
01:33:57,071 --> 01:33:59,680
in the face and taekwondo tournament.
So those guys,

2139
01:33:59,740 --> 01:34:02,380
when those guys get into Moitai,
that's Diego Nunez.

2140
01:34:02,381 --> 01:34:05,660
That's Anderson Silva.
That's also Edson Barboza.

2141
01:34:05,690 --> 01:34:07,210
They got all that shit in their back 
pocket.

2142
01:34:07,211 --> 01:34:08,910
Yeah,
that Edson Barboza Guy.

2143
01:34:08,960 --> 01:34:13,840
So you would say you would say that it's
for kids.

2144
01:34:13,870 --> 01:34:18,870
They're dreaming about being UFC 
champions to do some taekwondo for a few

2145
01:34:18,910 --> 01:34:20,110
years just to get,
get all that.

2146
01:34:20,130 --> 01:34:25,130
The crazy kicks down.
And stay balanced and maybe not even do 

2147
01:34:25,130 --> 01:34:28,561
taekwondo by itself,
but incorporate a couple of days of 

2148
01:34:28,561 --> 01:34:32,221
taekwondo training into your training,
like say if you were a new kid and you 

2149
01:34:32,221 --> 01:34:35,590
were trying to become an mma fighter,
what you should do is at least one day a

2150
01:34:35,591 --> 01:34:40,591
week work on kicks because one of the 
things you could do by working on these 

2151
01:34:40,591 --> 01:34:42,510
wild kicks is forget about the sparring,
forget whatever.

2152
01:34:42,511 --> 01:34:47,511
Then you just want to work on a 
technique and a kick and learn how to 

2153
01:34:47,511 --> 01:34:49,771
kick things.
Learn how to stretch out that front leg 

2154
01:34:49,771 --> 01:34:49,771
side kick learned to wheelchair,
learn the ax kick.

2155
01:34:49,771 --> 01:34:54,270
Once you do it,
if you do it with someone who's really 

2156
01:34:54,270 --> 01:34:56,131
good at it,
you see like the high level techniques 

2157
01:34:56,131 --> 01:34:56,740
you see when someone and then that's 
what you mirror and your mind and that's

2158
01:34:56,741 --> 01:34:57,920
what you try to recreate

2159
01:34:58,070 --> 01:34:59,690
and that's how you get really good at 
those things.

2160
01:34:59,810 --> 01:35:04,810
When you add in kicks,
a lot of those techniques go out the 

2161
01:35:04,810 --> 01:35:04,810
window.
When you add in punches,

2162
01:35:04,810 --> 01:35:05,840
a lot of those leg kicks,
excuse me,

2163
01:35:05,841 --> 01:35:07,910
allows techniques go out the window.
You add in punches,

2164
01:35:08,030 --> 01:35:09,380
a lot of those techniques go out the 
window.

2165
01:35:09,381 --> 01:35:14,381
You had to take downs.
A lot of those techniques go go out the 

2166
01:35:14,381 --> 01:35:15,110
window in less,
you know how to check kicks,

2167
01:35:15,170 --> 01:35:18,230
block takedowns,
and you have good boxing,

2168
01:35:18,260 --> 01:35:20,330
so you have to have all those other 
things.

2169
01:35:20,480 --> 01:35:25,480
Then you can use the taekwondo again 
because then you have all these other 

2170
01:35:25,480 --> 01:35:29,081
techniques.
Then it's just another tool for the 

2171
01:35:29,081 --> 01:35:31,181
arsenal,
but unless you have a fully rounded 

2172
01:35:31,181 --> 01:35:34,391
game,
those tools become problems like the 

2173
01:35:34,391 --> 01:35:37,751
kicks.
You rely on them too much and you drop 

2174
01:35:37,751 --> 01:35:39,821
your hands.
You get punched in the face because 

2175
01:35:39,821 --> 01:35:39,821
you're not used to being punched in the 
face,

2176
01:35:39,821 --> 01:35:42,340
so you have to develop good,
good timing and distance for punches as 

2177
01:35:42,340 --> 01:35:42,890
well as kicks.

2178
01:35:43,010 --> 01:35:45,590
You have to change your game,
but once you do change your game,

2179
01:35:45,800 --> 01:35:50,800
so that's the beauty of adding it in as 
like one day a week or two days a week 

2180
01:35:50,800 --> 01:35:53,510
where you just constantly work on only 
those techniques.

2181
01:35:53,670 --> 01:35:55,220
Then you're doing all that other stuff 
too,

2182
01:35:55,370 --> 01:35:57,800
so you might actually be able to pull 
them off.

2183
01:35:57,980 --> 01:36:01,010
I think eventually what we're going to 
have to have is there's going to be like

2184
01:36:01,011 --> 01:36:01,970
a system,
you know,

2185
01:36:01,971 --> 01:36:03,800
when they train football players,
you know,

2186
01:36:03,801 --> 01:36:04,260
and they,
they,

2187
01:36:04,261 --> 01:36:06,920
they don't just just take a lucky guess 
like,

2188
01:36:06,921 --> 01:36:09,080
today we're going to do this,
you know,

2189
01:36:09,081 --> 01:36:14,081
well,
I don't know that it's going to help 

2190
01:36:14,081 --> 01:36:15,611
you,
but today I want you to chop wood with 

2191
01:36:15,611 --> 01:36:15,611
an ax.
You know,

2192
01:36:15,611 --> 01:36:18,070
today,
maybe it'll help if you pick up bags of 

2193
01:36:18,070 --> 01:36:18,070
sand,
you know,

2194
01:36:18,070 --> 01:36:18,070
that.
No,

2195
01:36:18,070 --> 01:36:18,190
they don't do that.
They,

2196
01:36:18,240 --> 01:36:20,810
they know what the fuck they're doing 
when they're training football players,

2197
01:36:20,990 --> 01:36:23,330
they know what they're doing when 
they're preparing plays,

2198
01:36:23,420 --> 01:36:24,500
they know what they're doing.

2199
01:36:24,590 --> 01:36:25,860
You know when,
when guys are,

2200
01:36:25,930 --> 01:36:27,920
you know,
they're monitoring guys performances and

2201
01:36:27,950 --> 01:36:29,420
measuring their time,
their distance,

2202
01:36:29,540 --> 01:36:34,540
you know,
when they're running the 40 are running 

2203
01:36:34,540 --> 01:36:35,940
100.
They were there trying to figure out 

2204
01:36:35,940 --> 01:36:37,660
what is the,
what's the best way to optimize 

2205
01:36:37,660 --> 01:36:40,241
athleticism.
The eventually that's going to happen 

2206
01:36:40,241 --> 01:36:41,210
and it's going to be a scientific 
approach to mma training.

2207
01:36:41,420 --> 01:36:42,800
And there's gonna be a bunch of 
different approaches.

2208
01:36:43,010 --> 01:36:48,010
You know,
everyone's gonna have their own little 

2209
01:36:48,010 --> 01:36:48,010
style to do it,
but there's gonna.

2210
01:36:48,010 --> 01:36:51,070
It's going to get to a point where we 
know exactly how many hours you're 

2211
01:36:51,070 --> 01:36:52,550
supposed to train in a day before.
It's detrimental.

2212
01:36:52,670 --> 01:36:55,270
We know that even though you can do it,
you know,

2213
01:36:55,280 --> 01:36:57,290
five hours a day,
you shouldn't do it five hours a day.

2214
01:36:57,291 --> 01:36:59,870
It fucks you up.
We know what's the right amount,

2215
01:36:59,871 --> 01:37:02,660
what is the exact program you should be 
on as far as striking,

2216
01:37:02,810 --> 01:37:05,030
what does he,
what are the exact lessons you should be

2217
01:37:05,031 --> 01:37:07,250
learning every day because that's how it
should be treated.

2218
01:37:07,250 --> 01:37:12,250
It should be treated as something you're
trying to develop like a project you're 

2219
01:37:12,250 --> 01:37:13,790
developing and it should be micromanage.
You should manage every single aspect of

2220
01:37:13,791 --> 01:37:15,310
it.
You should manage all the hold.

2221
01:37:15,311 --> 01:37:18,110
You should objective,
analyze all the different techniques,

2222
01:37:18,260 --> 01:37:20,990
all your vulnerabilities and sparring.
Would body types,

2223
01:37:20,991 --> 01:37:22,700
give you problems,
all that shit.

2224
01:37:22,710 --> 01:37:26,870
It has to be treated like a science in 
order to really truly optimize it.

2225
01:37:27,110 --> 01:37:30,650
Then you add in creativity and you know 
the ability to improvise,

2226
01:37:30,800 --> 01:37:35,800
improvise,
and the ability to fight hard and the 

2227
01:37:35,800 --> 01:37:35,800
ability to be disciplined and get in 
shape,

2228
01:37:35,800 --> 01:37:40,360
but eventually we're going to get to 
that point where people are getting so 

2229
01:37:40,360 --> 01:37:40,360
good like these rory Mcdonald's of the 
world,

2230
01:37:40,400 --> 01:37:43,250
these young kids that are coming up,
they're so fucking good.

2231
01:37:43,430 --> 01:37:45,140
You see them improving every time you 
see them,

2232
01:37:45,141 --> 01:37:45,980
they're way better.
You're like,

2233
01:37:46,040 --> 01:37:48,200
wow.
Eventually it's going to be.

2234
01:37:48,260 --> 01:37:53,260
It's going to have to be down to a 
science because you're going to deal 

2235
01:37:53,260 --> 01:37:56,351
with the.
The abilities that people are going to 

2236
01:37:56,351 --> 01:37:56,351
have are going to be so fucking high

2237
01:37:56,351 --> 01:38:01,160
level.
You know at the very top we're going to 

2238
01:38:01,160 --> 01:38:01,560
see guys that we can't even imagine 
because we haven't seen them yet.

2239
01:38:01,830 --> 01:38:06,830
We haven't.
We're going to look back on even like 

2240
01:38:06,830 --> 01:38:08,340
Vito Belfort or guys of this era that 
are devastating.

2241
01:38:08,550 --> 01:38:10,380
We're going to look back on them and 
say,

2242
01:38:10,410 --> 01:38:12,840
boy,
but if they fought the guise of 2030,

2243
01:38:12,841 --> 01:38:17,841
they'd probably get fucked up.
You know the same way people look at 

2244
01:38:17,841 --> 01:38:18,880
Rocky Marciano and go,
what the fuck is Rocky Marciano?

2245
01:38:18,881 --> 01:38:23,881
And you're going to do the Vitaly 
Klitschko fatality Klitschko seven feet 

2246
01:38:23,881 --> 01:38:27,201
fucking tall is he's got a telephone 
pole for a job and it would just blast 

2247
01:38:27,201 --> 01:38:29,100
that poor little dude in the head all 
day until he fell unconscious.

2248
01:38:29,520 --> 01:38:30,840
No,
and that's what we're going to look back

2249
01:38:30,841 --> 01:38:31,260
on.
Now.

2250
01:38:31,261 --> 01:38:33,480
We're going to look back on it.
The greats like GSP.

2251
01:38:33,481 --> 01:38:34,830
We're going to look back on him.
Now,

2252
01:38:35,100 --> 01:38:40,100
one day,
you know in the future where there's 

2253
01:38:40,100 --> 01:38:41,940
going to be some super fucking freak 
athlete who you think would probably 

2254
01:38:41,940 --> 01:38:43,230
beat GSP fairly easily.

2255
01:38:43,560 --> 01:38:44,550
It's gonna Happen,
man.

2256
01:38:44,850 --> 01:38:49,850
It's going to happen in all the way 
classes were in the middle of the 

2257
01:38:49,850 --> 01:38:50,610
fucking stream right now.
We haven't even come close to the dam.

2258
01:38:51,030 --> 01:38:54,150
We're not even close to the full limits 
of human potential.

2259
01:38:54,360 --> 01:38:57,420
You think about the kind of freak 
athletes that they have in basketball.

2260
01:38:57,700 --> 01:39:00,720
We wait until those all guys,
those all start fighting MMA fights.

2261
01:39:01,090 --> 01:39:06,090
Think about some of the amazing 
specimens that choose to play baseball 

2262
01:39:06,090 --> 01:39:06,240
because they're good sprinters and they 
could run around,

2263
01:39:06,290 --> 01:39:06,930
uh,
the,

2264
01:39:06,931 --> 01:39:07,710
uh,
the,

2265
01:39:07,711 --> 01:39:08,100
uh,
the,

2266
01:39:08,200 --> 01:39:13,200
the basis real quickly,
what if those guys decided to start 

2267
01:39:13,200 --> 01:39:13,200
fighting,
you know,

2268
01:39:13,200 --> 01:39:14,190
those are the,
those are the real freak athletes.

2269
01:39:14,490 --> 01:39:16,050
Like I was telling you.
I mean,

2270
01:39:16,051 --> 01:39:19,610
I've been doing Jujitsu a long time and,
and when you trained,

2271
01:39:19,640 --> 01:39:21,720
you get to even a couple of years,
you know,

2272
01:39:21,730 --> 01:39:24,070
if you're going against a wrestler,
you know,

2273
01:39:24,190 --> 01:39:25,380
you role with someone,
you're like,

2274
01:39:25,381 --> 01:39:26,460
damn,
did you wrestle,

2275
01:39:26,670 --> 01:39:28,770
you know,
they feel like a whole different person.

2276
01:39:29,310 --> 01:39:32,190
And you know,
after awhile after doing it for 10,

2277
01:39:32,191 --> 01:39:34,020
15 years,
you get really,

2278
01:39:34,021 --> 01:39:36,710
really good at gauging someone's 
strength and you know,

2279
01:39:36,720 --> 01:39:39,550
kind of guessing what kind of athletic 
background they had or if they,

2280
01:39:39,551 --> 01:39:42,270
you know,
I brought with soccer players due to the

2281
01:39:42,271 --> 01:39:43,660
dudes that played soccer their whole 
life.

2282
01:39:43,661 --> 01:39:44,340
And I'm like,
wow,

2283
01:39:44,341 --> 01:39:47,640
they got some strong passing strong 
hips,

2284
01:39:48,300 --> 01:39:53,300
you know.
And a year ago I opened 10 planet Vista 

2285
01:39:53,640 --> 01:39:54,320
and that's,
that's,

2286
01:39:54,340 --> 01:39:56,790
uh,
that's in San Diego County.

2287
01:39:57,150 --> 01:39:58,540
And inside a 10th planet.
This,

2288
01:39:58,541 --> 01:40:00,740
that they have a dance studio too.
It's like,

2289
01:40:00,741 --> 01:40:03,090
you know,
in my studio we have pole dancers.

2290
01:40:03,360 --> 01:40:08,360
Every,
every academy has their own little 

2291
01:40:08,360 --> 01:40:08,760
flavor down at Vista they have a break 
dancing.

2292
01:40:08,761 --> 01:40:11,270
It's like a new eclectic breakdancing,
the combines,

2293
01:40:11,330 --> 01:40:13,560
Kung Fu,
break dancing,

2294
01:40:13,710 --> 01:40:16,320
yoga,
double load of stuff,

2295
01:40:16,321 --> 01:40:18,450
and it's all based on getting into 
double load is,

2296
01:40:18,510 --> 01:40:19,440
it's,
it's a trip.

2297
01:40:19,470 --> 01:40:21,270
So it's like rubber guard,
breakdancing.

2298
01:40:21,540 --> 01:40:26,540
Well there's a group out there,
they've been dead for people that don't 

2299
01:40:26,540 --> 01:40:28,740
know Double Lotus for the folks who 
don't know is like a yoga position where

2300
01:40:28,741 --> 01:40:32,520
you have one foot and then you wrap the 
other foot over onto the other needs.

2301
01:40:32,521 --> 01:40:35,280
Very difficult to get into for the 
average unflexible person.

2302
01:40:35,310 --> 01:40:37,680
It's like a super flexible Indian style 
type thing.

2303
01:40:37,710 --> 01:40:39,000
Yes,
that's good way of putting it.

2304
01:40:39,360 --> 01:40:40,890
And uh,
you know,

2305
01:40:40,920 --> 01:40:45,920
the school opened and right away other 
breakdancer started taking Jujitsu and 

2306
01:40:45,920 --> 01:40:47,610
there's one lead.
Breakdancers name is Gio.

2307
01:40:47,640 --> 01:40:51,490
He calls himself freak show and after 
two months of training he,

2308
01:40:51,560 --> 01:40:53,920
he goes onto himself freak show that the
whole,

2309
01:40:53,980 --> 01:40:56,800
the whole thing's a freak show.
It's like a,

2310
01:40:56,890 --> 01:40:58,990
it's like a bad name.
They're a group freak show.

2311
01:41:00,830 --> 01:41:05,830
When you roll with them,
you're going to feel a little freak 

2312
01:41:05,830 --> 01:41:05,830
show.
It's incredibly.

2313
01:41:05,830 --> 01:41:09,891
It's 145 pounds and after training two 
months he did the gracie nationals and 

2314
01:41:10,090 --> 01:41:11,080
it looked like,
you know,

2315
01:41:11,110 --> 01:41:13,530
he did beginners division,
but it looked like he was sandbag and he

2316
01:41:13,540 --> 01:41:16,990
was just gone right through.
Dude there was incredible and I thought,

2317
01:41:16,991 --> 01:41:21,991
wow,
what's this guy gonna look like in a 

2318
01:41:21,991 --> 01:41:21,991
couple of years?
Well,

2319
01:41:21,991 --> 01:41:22,210
a year,
a year later,

2320
01:41:22,300 --> 01:41:26,080
Sean ballinger is one of my black belt.
He is the one who certified that school.

2321
01:41:26,081 --> 01:41:28,540
He gave him a purple belt after one 
year.

2322
01:41:28,600 --> 01:41:29,560
And I'm like,
wow,

2323
01:41:29,820 --> 01:41:31,540
I mean,
how good is this guy getting now?

2324
01:41:31,870 --> 01:41:35,470
So I invited him in all his breakdancers
over to headquarters,

2325
01:41:35,471 --> 01:41:37,740
my school here in La and they,
you know,

2326
01:41:37,840 --> 01:41:40,480
he had a year experience and was already
a purple belt.

2327
01:41:40,700 --> 01:41:41,380
And I'm like,
hmm,

2328
01:41:41,381 --> 01:41:44,200
this guy is like a really is a frequent.
Let me see what he feels like.

2329
01:41:44,201 --> 01:41:46,270
So I rolled with them and it was 
incredible.

2330
01:41:46,271 --> 01:41:47,730
I'd never felt,
you know,

2331
01:41:47,731 --> 01:41:49,990
if a guy told me,
he wrestled his whole life and he's been

2332
01:41:49,991 --> 01:41:54,580
doing Jujitsu a year,
I would have a way easier time with that

2333
01:41:54,581 --> 01:41:57,370
guy than I did,
especially when he weighs 140,

2334
01:41:57,371 --> 01:41:58,420
100,
45 pounds.

2335
01:41:58,720 --> 01:42:03,720
It was incredible.
I've never felt anything like this and 

2336
01:42:03,720 --> 01:42:05,170
even the guys that were on a squad that 
were training eight months,

2337
01:42:05,230 --> 01:42:09,730
10 months size turbo and ozone,
that I'd never felt anything like this.

2338
01:42:09,731 --> 01:42:12,310
It was incredible.
It would you say turbo and ozone.

2339
01:42:12,370 --> 01:42:14,620
So what that mean?
That's from the movie breaking.

2340
01:42:14,710 --> 01:42:15,330
Those were two.

2341
01:42:17,440 --> 01:42:19,420
So these,
these exercises that they do,

2342
01:42:19,421 --> 01:42:24,421
it's like at all,
they're doing one handed handstands 

2343
01:42:24,421 --> 01:42:24,780
getting into flying,
double loaded.

2344
01:42:24,940 --> 01:42:27,280
They're balancing on their head without 
spinning.

2345
01:42:27,281 --> 01:42:32,281
You know,
the old school break dancers would spin 

2346
01:42:32,281 --> 01:42:34,031
and then they would balance like a top.
They just get on their head and their 

2347
01:42:34,031 --> 01:42:34,900
balance is so extraordinary.
It's unbelievable.

2348
01:42:34,901 --> 01:42:36,680
They do like cirque Cirque du Solei 
stuff.

2349
01:42:36,850 --> 01:42:41,320
Cirque du Solei is the only time that I 
can ever remember as a man feeling low.

2350
01:42:41,410 --> 01:42:46,410
I went with a chick and as I was in the 
audience watching and I felt inadequate,

2351
01:42:47,500 --> 01:42:52,260
I felt like I can't do that.
These guys like,

2352
01:42:52,360 --> 01:42:52,680
you know,
I,

2353
01:42:52,681 --> 01:42:55,090
I think of myself as being a guy who was
in good shape.

2354
01:42:55,091 --> 01:42:57,400
I'm fit.
I work out all the time and I'm watching

2355
01:42:57,401 --> 01:42:58,360
these guys move around.
I'm like,

2356
01:42:58,361 --> 01:43:03,361
Whoa,
that guy just is doing a one handed 

2357
01:43:03,361 --> 01:43:03,361
handstand.

2358
01:43:03,361 --> 01:43:06,000
His legs are going that way and he's 
holding another man up in the air above 

2359
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:06,000
him.
Yeah.

2360
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,170
Huggies is fucking.
It was the craziest thing ever.

2361
01:43:08,171 --> 01:43:10,690
Like the idea that someone can be that 
physically strong,

2362
01:43:10,720 --> 01:43:13,120
they're doing one hand in hand stands 
and I got this on video,

2363
01:43:13,290 --> 01:43:14,740
video taped everything,
all those guys.

2364
01:43:14,741 --> 01:43:17,470
It was unbelievable that they get on one
hand,

2365
01:43:17,520 --> 01:43:18,970
handstands,
get into flying,

2366
01:43:18,971 --> 01:43:21,100
double load is and start jumping and 
hopping.

2367
01:43:21,101 --> 01:43:26,101
On one hand.
It's incredible when you feel like how 

2368
01:43:26,101 --> 01:43:27,630
strong they are and I'm convinced that 
come,

2369
01:43:28,120 --> 01:43:33,120
you know,
a lot of people separate balance 

2370
01:43:33,120 --> 01:43:35,251
exercises and then core exercises.
I think there's something about 

2371
01:43:35,251 --> 01:43:40,050
combining core extreme core training,
like they're doing all these handstands 

2372
01:43:40,050 --> 01:43:41,350
and balancing and then combining extreme
balance.

2373
01:43:41,530 --> 01:43:46,530
You put them together.
I think that really does create a whole 

2374
01:43:46,530 --> 01:43:46,530
new animal because I've never felt 
anything like this.

2375
01:43:46,530 --> 01:43:49,810
It's combining core exercises and 
extreme balance.

2376
01:43:49,870 --> 01:43:53,210
At the same time turns your body into 
something different.

2377
01:43:53,450 --> 01:43:55,340
It totally makes sense.
Something about it,

2378
01:43:55,390 --> 01:44:00,390
you know,
the ability to manipulate your body at 

2379
01:44:00,390 --> 01:44:02,171
an extreme in an extreme way.
Yoga alone makes you better at 

2380
01:44:02,511 --> 01:44:07,511
everything you do athletically.
It gives you much more control and much 

2381
01:44:07,511 --> 01:44:07,550
more.
You know,

2382
01:44:07,551 --> 01:44:09,590
uh,
just you have,

2383
01:44:10,040 --> 01:44:13,760
you have a finer degree of movement 
where you can,

2384
01:44:13,761 --> 01:44:16,040
you can balance yourself better.
You have more,

2385
01:44:16,280 --> 01:44:18,420
but that's way harder than yoga.
Yeah,

2386
01:44:18,490 --> 01:44:19,430
it's,
it's incredible.

2387
01:44:19,470 --> 01:44:23,180
It's extreme yoga because there's a lot 
of yoga.

2388
01:44:23,990 --> 01:44:28,990
There's their style is,
is a combination of everything they're 

2389
01:44:28,990 --> 01:44:33,731
doing.
They're bringing Kung Fu and they're 

2390
01:44:33,731 --> 01:44:33,731
bringing break dance and they're 
bringing yoga,

2391
01:44:33,731 --> 01:44:36,500
putting it all together,
and like Cirque du Solei.

2392
01:44:36,890 --> 01:44:38,960
It's incredible.
These guys,

2393
01:44:38,961 --> 01:44:43,961
these guys are incredible.
I have seen some break dancers do some 

2394
01:44:43,961 --> 01:44:44,650
wild ass fucking Kung Fu kicks.

2395
01:44:45,080 --> 01:44:46,700
They call themselves the freak show,
man.

2396
01:44:46,730 --> 01:44:51,730
I've seen breakdancers do those flying 
flip kicks where they flipped through 

2397
01:44:51,730 --> 01:44:52,190
the air and throw kicks at the same 
time.

2398
01:44:52,820 --> 01:44:57,230
Obviously the way I look at is you need 
a lot more bass in wrestling than you do

2399
01:44:57,231 --> 01:45:02,231
in Jujitsu and Jujitsu's.
The level of basis that's required is 

2400
01:45:02,231 --> 01:45:06,461
not nearly as much as wrestling.
Wrestling is all about getting that top 

2401
01:45:06,461 --> 01:45:06,461
position.
It's all about balance.

2402
01:45:06,461 --> 01:45:11,141
It's all about base,
but this style of breakdancing requires 

2403
01:45:11,141 --> 01:45:13,850
like 10 times more base than a rustler 
to do all these crazy things.

2404
01:45:13,970 --> 01:45:18,500
The base and the balances it's required.
It's crazy.

2405
01:45:18,680 --> 01:45:20,900
So when they come back down and do 
Jujitsu,

2406
01:45:21,080 --> 01:45:23,960
like the hardest part in Jujitsu is 
getting the base and the balance.

2407
01:45:23,961 --> 01:45:25,730
The movies are actually fairly easy to 
learn.

2408
01:45:25,731 --> 01:45:29,240
You could show a nine year old girl a 
rear naked choke and they could learn it

2409
01:45:29,241 --> 01:45:30,620
in like five minutes or less.

2410
01:45:30,830 --> 01:45:35,830
It's the balance and putting it all 
together and the coordination and the 

2411
01:45:35,830 --> 01:45:37,130
dexterity and man,
when they come down.

2412
01:45:37,131 --> 01:45:42,131
And did you get so once they learned 
that the basic object of the game and a 

2413
01:45:42,131 --> 01:45:43,250
couple passes,
it's extraordinary.

2414
01:45:43,370 --> 01:45:45,080
It really is.
That's amazing.

2415
01:45:45,110 --> 01:45:50,110
What W,
what does that turns out to be the the 

2416
01:45:50,110 --> 01:45:51,821
workout,
extreme gymnastics or stream 

2417
01:45:51,821 --> 01:45:52,550
breakdancing.
I'm infusing that they're going to be so

2418
01:45:52,551 --> 01:45:54,710
entertaining.
You know what I mean?

2419
01:45:54,711 --> 01:45:57,140
It's going to be like choreographed.
This is the beginning of.

2420
01:45:57,160 --> 01:46:02,160
This is the beginning of the infusion of
this style of exercise into the 10th 

2421
01:46:02,160 --> 01:46:02,750
planet system.
I'm definitely.

2422
01:46:02,751 --> 01:46:03,790
I'm sold.
I'm like,

2423
01:46:03,800 --> 01:46:07,040
I'm at the gym weightlifting.
I've been doing Jujitsu for 17 years and

2424
01:46:07,041 --> 01:46:08,980
I'm doing squats and doing 
weightlifting.

2425
01:46:09,040 --> 01:46:09,390
Yes,
I'm,

2426
01:46:09,510 --> 01:46:11,600
I'm.
I'm stronger than if I wasn't doing it.

2427
01:46:11,601 --> 01:46:16,601
But when you roll with a guy that's been
doing Jujitsu a year and he just feels 

2428
01:46:16,601 --> 01:46:18,020
any,
and I got 20 pounds on him,

2429
01:46:18,200 --> 01:46:19,280
it's pretty extraordinary.

2430
01:46:19,280 --> 01:46:21,260
Everybody like respond first told me.
He goes,

2431
01:46:21,261 --> 01:46:22,940
he went down there and did a seminar.
He goes,

2432
01:46:22,941 --> 01:46:25,190
dude,
if he rolled that Geo kid yet and I go,

2433
01:46:25,191 --> 01:46:26,960
no dude,
I couldn't get that guy.

2434
01:46:27,170 --> 01:46:29,990
That guy's watch way to.
Well with them.

2435
01:46:29,991 --> 01:46:32,180
It's incredible and it's not just him.
Like I said,

2436
01:46:32,181 --> 01:46:37,181
the other guys,
there were small dudes too that we're 

2437
01:46:37,181 --> 01:46:37,190
been doing Jujitsu eight months,
10 months and yeah,

2438
01:46:37,191 --> 01:46:38,420
I was getting them,
but dude,

2439
01:46:38,421 --> 01:46:40,880
I was going 100 percent.
It should have been really,

2440
01:46:40,881 --> 01:46:42,440
really easy.
It wasn't really easy.

2441
01:46:42,500 --> 01:46:44,000
That's amazing.
It's incredible,

2442
01:46:44,001 --> 01:46:44,890
man.
So I'm.

2443
01:46:44,891 --> 01:46:46,580
I'm starting already.
I'm like,

2444
01:46:46,730 --> 01:46:49,350
my balance is terrible.
I can't do handstands,

2445
01:46:49,351 --> 01:46:50,430
but I'm practicing

2446
01:46:50,430 --> 01:46:53,970
against walls.
I'm going to slowly infuse that into the

2447
01:46:53,971 --> 01:46:55,560
system.
I'm going to make that my workout.

2448
01:46:55,590 --> 01:46:57,930
You don't also heard is really good too,
is polities.

2449
01:46:58,230 --> 01:47:03,230
I think someone has a police for 
grapplers who doesn't want to loiter 

2450
01:47:03,230 --> 01:47:03,230
ones?
Dude,

2451
01:47:03,480 --> 01:47:06,930
dudes have a place for grapplers DVD out
or something like that.

2452
01:47:07,600 --> 01:47:08,580
Hmm.
I don't know,

2453
01:47:08,790 --> 01:47:11,480
but I read something about plays online.
There's some athlete.

2454
01:47:11,481 --> 01:47:15,000
It was looking to do something relaxing 
in between seasons.

2455
01:47:15,240 --> 01:47:20,240
He started doing pilates and who's 
talking about how ridiculously hard it 

2456
01:47:20,240 --> 01:47:21,710
is and people think it's easy because 
chicks are doing it but polite,

2457
01:47:21,720 --> 01:47:23,630
especially for a man to carry,
you know,

2458
01:47:23,640 --> 01:47:25,640
carrying a different amount of weight.
You know,

2459
01:47:26,440 --> 01:47:28,350
Palantir is supposed to be super awesome
for you.

2460
01:47:28,860 --> 01:47:30,190
There's a lot of different things you 
can do.

2461
01:47:30,200 --> 01:47:34,950
It's amazing how like pliable and 
developable,

2462
01:47:35,040 --> 01:47:39,860
developable engineerable the body is.
Hey,

2463
01:47:39,870 --> 01:47:42,390
you can force it to do certain things 
like,

2464
01:47:42,391 --> 01:47:44,630
think of like,
look,

2465
01:47:44,700 --> 01:47:49,700
I'm a perfect example,
like growing up doing taekwondo and my 

2466
01:47:49,700 --> 01:47:50,280
body's still can do all that crazy shit.
You know,

2467
01:47:50,281 --> 01:47:52,380
even if I took years off,
you got to pee.

2468
01:47:54,950 --> 01:47:59,950
Your body adapts,
your body adapting.

2469
01:48:00,910 --> 01:48:05,490
It fits into a couch perfectly when you 
talk about,

2470
01:48:05,491 --> 01:48:07,460
um,
about being worried about your health as

2471
01:48:07,461 --> 01:48:08,210
you get older.
Man,

2472
01:48:08,240 --> 01:48:10,910
why don't you stop smoking cigarettes?
Because it's awesome.

2473
01:48:10,911 --> 01:48:12,290
I love it.
It was really that good.

2474
01:48:12,320 --> 01:48:17,320
So great.
Why don't you try cigars that's worse 

2475
01:48:17,320 --> 01:48:17,320
for you?
That's like,

2476
01:48:17,320 --> 01:48:21,050
I don't think seeing all the fucking 
cancer into your mouth and throat and 

2477
01:48:21,050 --> 01:48:21,170
gums.
I don't think it is.

2478
01:48:21,320 --> 01:48:21,900
I think,
um,

2479
01:48:22,220 --> 01:48:24,200
I think it gives you a little nicotine 
fix.

2480
01:48:24,201 --> 01:48:25,250
That's all.
Phil Hartman quit.

2481
01:48:26,180 --> 01:48:29,280
Quit smoking cigarettes or smoking 
cigars and I go to Jeff's smoke all day.

2482
01:48:29,281 --> 01:48:29,630
He goes,
no,

2483
01:48:29,631 --> 01:48:32,090
I smoked one or two a day at the most.
He just,

2484
01:48:32,091 --> 01:48:37,091
uh,
he just gives you a little fix and then 

2485
01:48:37,091 --> 01:48:37,190
you can slowly wean yourself off of it 
because what you're really hooked on,

2486
01:48:37,760 --> 01:48:41,480
according to people online,
I don't know if it's true,

2487
01:48:41,660 --> 01:48:44,000
what you're really hooked on is not just
the tobacco,

2488
01:48:44,001 --> 01:48:47,870
but the 599 additives that the way 
they've got it engineered.

2489
01:48:48,020 --> 01:48:51,410
If you can still get tobacco into your 
system and nicotine into your system,

2490
01:48:51,411 --> 01:48:53,840
you can slip away from the grips of 
addiction slowly.

2491
01:48:54,190 --> 01:48:56,360
They say it takes 10 years off your life
though,

2492
01:48:56,450 --> 01:48:56,960
and it's like,
Ah,

2493
01:48:56,961 --> 01:49:01,961
who cares?
Who wants to live the extra 10 years of 

2494
01:49:01,961 --> 01:49:01,961
your life?
That's not what it is.

2495
01:49:01,961 --> 01:49:01,961
It makes,
makes.

2496
01:49:01,961 --> 01:49:03,500
When you're 50,
you feel like you're 60,

2497
01:49:03,970 --> 01:49:05,600
you're 60,
you feel like you're 70.

2498
01:49:05,740 --> 01:49:07,490
It doesn't just take 10 years off your 
life.

2499
01:49:07,700 --> 01:49:10,880
It makes you feel really old,
shitty.

2500
01:49:11,390 --> 01:49:11,900
You're,
you're,

2501
01:49:11,901 --> 01:49:13,610
you're cooking your body.
Enjoy it.

2502
01:49:13,611 --> 01:49:15,170
If you like it,
you say you love it,

2503
01:49:15,680 --> 01:49:20,680
enjoy it.
Do you take vitamins and try to 

2504
01:49:20,680 --> 01:49:20,680
counteract the cigarettes?
Uh,

2505
01:49:20,680 --> 01:49:21,950
I've been juicing and I've been doing 
the juice thing.

2506
01:49:22,010 --> 01:49:23,750
Wake up and do how many cigarettes a 
day?

2507
01:49:24,290 --> 01:49:27,740
Pack a whole pack now.
God Damn Son,

2508
01:49:28,070 --> 01:49:31,250
you were only about 10 cigarettes a day 
for a while,

2509
01:49:31,280 --> 01:49:33,590
but that was right after I quit when I 
started back up again.

2510
01:49:33,620 --> 01:49:35,870
Because when you start back up,
you don't go right to the full pack.

2511
01:49:35,890 --> 01:49:40,890
He slowly go,
I'm only smoking 10 a day and then next 

2512
01:49:40,890 --> 01:49:42,530
thing I know you're smoking,
you should go and do that Ibogaine Shit.

2513
01:49:42,800 --> 01:49:47,800
I began for treatment.
Does that work for from supposed

2514
01:49:47,990 --> 01:49:50,380
to be amazing for any addictions?
Not all of them.

2515
01:49:50,410 --> 01:49:53,590
Does their certain pills that have done 
like it doesn't work on Benzos.

2516
01:49:53,770 --> 01:49:54,340
Really?
Yeah.

2517
01:49:54,341 --> 01:49:59,341
There's certain things like I for some 
reason it has something to do with 

2518
01:49:59,621 --> 01:50:01,180
alcohol.
Like in Brazil,

2519
01:50:01,240 --> 01:50:03,310
the people that are part of the IOWASCA 
religions,

2520
01:50:03,640 --> 01:50:08,640
they give their kids at 14 Iowasca to 
prevent them from being an alcoholic.

2521
01:50:09,220 --> 01:50:12,550
So that's real shit.
So would that make sense?

2522
01:50:12,970 --> 01:50:17,970
Well,
I think that's because it's insightful 

2523
01:50:17,970 --> 01:50:20,460
because it lets you see.
It lets you experience a deep spiritual 

2524
01:50:20,460 --> 01:50:21,340
connection with the mother earth and 
then you don't.

2525
01:50:21,540 --> 01:50:23,710
You don't want to be a fucking loser,
you know when you,

2526
01:50:23,711 --> 01:50:26,470
when you're in the presence of some form
of divinity,

2527
01:50:26,920 --> 01:50:29,640
whatever the fuck the spirit of the Iowa
is,

2528
01:50:29,650 --> 01:50:32,350
whatever it is that when you have that 
like crazy experience,

2529
01:50:32,530 --> 01:50:34,030
whatever the fuck you're in,
the presence of you,

2530
01:50:34,050 --> 01:50:39,050
that that presence affects you forever.
I mean that's essentially what these 

2531
01:50:39,050 --> 01:50:39,070
people are saying that as John Hopkins 
University study,

2532
01:50:39,071 --> 01:50:41,110
it changes their personality.
It makes them money.

2533
01:50:41,650 --> 01:50:46,650
And when you had.
I heard that Graham Hancock podcast and 

2534
01:50:46,650 --> 01:50:48,340
when you guys were talking about 
Iowasca,

2535
01:50:48,490 --> 01:50:53,490
you guys were talking about how the 
spirit of Iowasca or whatever it is,

2536
01:50:54,381 --> 01:50:57,940
is female and you guys were into the,
the,

2537
01:50:58,660 --> 01:51:01,090
whatever you call it,
the spirit world or,

2538
01:51:01,510 --> 01:51:06,510
or whatever that Iowasca dimension is.
What do you think that is?

2539
01:51:09,240 --> 01:51:09,470
Thank

2540
01:51:09,480 --> 01:51:14,480
you know when you were talking about 
there's information around us all the 

2541
01:51:14,480 --> 01:51:17,211
time and if we could have goggles that 
could see all the fucking ones and 

2542
01:51:17,211 --> 01:51:20,151
zero's flying through the air and all 
the cellular signals and all the Wifi 

2543
01:51:20,151 --> 01:51:24,861
and I think it's very likely that we are
just at a stop on the dial and that the 

2544
01:51:27,031 --> 01:51:32,031
reality of infinity is that there is a 
unlimited number of frequencies to tune 

2545
01:51:32,821 --> 01:51:36,080
into and it's not as simple as you know,
we live in one.

2546
01:51:36,180 --> 01:51:40,230
I mean we know according to quantum 
physicists and I don't understand it,

2547
01:51:40,380 --> 01:51:43,500
but I'll repeat what they say is that 
there are 11 dimensions,

2548
01:51:43,501 --> 01:51:48,501
11 known dimensions,
provable somehow or another by some 

2549
01:51:48,501 --> 01:51:49,860
mathematics that I'll never understand.
So if that's the case,

2550
01:51:49,861 --> 01:51:54,861
what does that mean?
If we know that we have time and space 

2551
01:51:54,861 --> 01:51:56,160
and we know that the basic dimensions 
that we're comfortable with,

2552
01:51:56,161 --> 01:51:57,900
what the fuck are these other ones?

2553
01:51:57,990 --> 01:51:59,220
What the fuck is what?
What is,

2554
01:51:59,250 --> 01:52:04,250
what are those and how do we know that 
this is just one sort of discovery on 

2555
01:52:04,250 --> 01:52:05,730
the way to discovering that,
oh no,

2556
01:52:05,880 --> 01:52:10,880
this is a part of another fractal and 
there are infinite numbers of different 

2557
01:52:10,880 --> 01:52:13,530
dimensions because that to me seems just
as likely as it's more than one.

2558
01:52:13,860 --> 01:52:16,530
I have a feeling that there's just an 
unlimited number of them,

2559
01:52:16,531 --> 01:52:21,531
but we exist in one dimension.
We don't understand the other ones.

2560
01:52:21,661 --> 01:52:26,220
We can't tune into them and part of our 
brain can and part of our brain,

2561
01:52:26,221 --> 01:52:31,221
Ken,
when we sleep and part of our brain can 

2562
01:52:31,221 --> 01:52:33,801
and we think of we think of traveling as
a physical act of moving your tissue and

2563
01:52:34,111 --> 01:52:37,920
your cells and your bones from one space
to another space,

2564
01:52:38,130 --> 01:52:41,520
but that's silly.
What the fuck is imagination?

2565
01:52:41,521 --> 01:52:42,930
What are thoughts?
What are ideas?

2566
01:52:42,930 --> 01:52:47,930
What are language?
These are all things that are in the 

2567
01:52:47,930 --> 01:52:49,731
air.
These are all things that travel from 

2568
01:52:49,731 --> 01:52:50,960
people to people in the air,
but they create things and things become

2569
01:52:50,961 --> 01:52:55,961
of them and in empires get built because
of using words and all this stuff comes 

2570
01:52:55,961 --> 01:52:59,870
from the human imagination and the human
imagination is what tunes in when you're

2571
01:52:59,871 --> 01:53:04,871
sleeping and it's where all these 
psychedelic compounds that are all 

2572
01:53:04,871 --> 01:53:08,201
created by your own body.
They'd all interacts with all that shit 

2573
01:53:08,201 --> 01:53:11,620
and that's how things get done and that 
is why there is creativity that that is 

2574
01:53:11,800 --> 01:53:14,150
the source of all of it.
The human imagination,

2575
01:53:14,151 --> 01:53:18,110
the human mind is the source of all this
craziness that we say good and bad

2576
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:21,940
based on all that,
like all that craziness.

2577
01:53:22,630 --> 01:53:24,400
What do you think?
What would you guess?

2578
01:53:24,520 --> 01:53:25,480
Like,
I think it's another.

2579
01:53:26,020 --> 01:53:27,550
When you die,
what do you think happened?

2580
01:53:27,551 --> 01:53:29,230
I think you'd go right to that DMT 
world,

2581
01:53:29,231 --> 01:53:31,840
man.
You think your soul is eternal triggered

2582
01:53:31,990 --> 01:53:32,940
guessing,
but if you.

2583
01:53:33,160 --> 01:53:34,540
If you had to,
if you had to guess,

2584
01:53:34,541 --> 01:53:36,580
you would think the soul is eternal.
This is what I think

2585
01:53:36,940 --> 01:53:39,940
the idea of you dis.
It just stops,

2586
01:53:40,100 --> 01:53:43,540
stops it ends.
I think the only reason why you and I or

2587
01:53:43,541 --> 01:53:45,220
I and all of us,
anybody listening,

2588
01:53:45,250 --> 01:53:50,250
the only reason why we think of 
ourselves as one is because of our ego 

2589
01:53:50,250 --> 01:53:53,530
and it's because of our desire to 
protect our biology and to breed.

2590
01:53:53,710 --> 01:53:57,400
We are.
We are programmed to seek out a breeding

2591
01:53:57,401 --> 01:54:02,401
partner and reproduce.
It's all natural and it's all chemical 

2592
01:54:02,401 --> 01:54:05,671
and then there's all sorts of roles that
we play in society to ensure that the 

2593
01:54:05,671 --> 01:54:09,121
best genetics and the ones that are 
moving forward the most are the ones 

2594
01:54:09,121 --> 01:54:12,301
that get to breed the most and it's all 
like simple and scientific and it all 

2595
01:54:12,301 --> 01:54:16,510
seems to me to be a part of some sort of
an engineered system,

2596
01:54:16,690 --> 01:54:20,280
an engineered system that's guaranteed 
to produce certain certain

2597
01:54:20,310 --> 01:54:21,120
results.
You know,

2598
01:54:21,240 --> 01:54:23,420
bacteria,
they have their job in.

2599
01:54:23,530 --> 01:54:25,560
You know,
every cell has its job,

2600
01:54:25,561 --> 01:54:28,170
but they don't really.
They're not really.

2601
01:54:28,290 --> 01:54:33,290
You wouldn't think the bacteria is 
conscious of what it's doing to our 

2602
01:54:33,290 --> 01:54:33,290
bodies.
It's very important.

2603
01:54:33,290 --> 01:54:36,450
Do you think like in this dimension,
we're going around with their own lives,

2604
01:54:36,630 --> 01:54:37,950
watching tv,
doing our own thing,

2605
01:54:38,160 --> 01:54:40,890
but on the other side,
in another dimension,

2606
01:54:42,060 --> 01:54:44,610
what we're doing,
our our energy,

2607
01:54:44,850 --> 01:54:49,850
our frequency is important to what is 
going on the other side.

2608
01:54:50,340 --> 01:54:55,340
We might be a cold,
we might be a cold for another 

2609
01:54:55,340 --> 01:54:55,470
dimension.
Yeah,

2610
01:54:55,500 --> 01:55:00,500
that's what we might be.
We might be the negative energy that 

2611
01:55:00,500 --> 01:55:01,650
creeps through the cracks and Fox with 
their world because we're polluting our.

2612
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:06,070
That's.
It just sounds like super old drug.

2613
01:55:06,100 --> 01:55:10,480
Crazy sophisticated and complicated and 
so complex.

2614
01:55:10,500 --> 01:55:11,620
Well organized,
you know,

2615
01:55:11,621 --> 01:55:14,380
it's just like.
It's sounds very intelligent,

2616
01:55:14,381 --> 01:55:15,010
doesn't it?
Well,

2617
01:55:15,011 --> 01:55:16,420
I don't.
I wouldn't say intelligent,

2618
01:55:16,421 --> 01:55:19,510
but I would definitely say it follows a 
very specific direction,

2619
01:55:19,940 --> 01:55:22,090
you know?
I mean whether or not it's aware of that

2620
01:55:22,091 --> 01:55:27,091
direction is another question entirely 
and I think that that's really 

2621
01:55:27,091 --> 01:55:30,421
debatable.
I think that I don't think fucking 

2622
01:55:30,421 --> 01:55:33,200
caterpillars aware that it's going to 
become a butterfly and I don't think a 

2623
01:55:33,200 --> 01:55:35,650
human being isn't necessarily aware of 
why the fuck all what all we're doing is

2624
01:55:35,651 --> 01:55:38,140
we're moving towards a certain direction
knowing we're not knowing it,

2625
01:55:38,530 --> 01:55:41,650
so I wouldn't say it's intelligent.
I would say it's a direction.

2626
01:55:41,651 --> 01:55:44,040
It's a very specific direction.
The only time

2627
01:55:44,040 --> 01:55:49,040
I feel like a contact with intelligence,
like real divine intelligence is 

2628
01:55:49,290 --> 01:55:54,290
psychedelic experiences.
Those are the only time I feel humbled 

2629
01:55:54,290 --> 01:55:57,891
by something.
What however the fuck it is way smarter 

2630
01:55:57,891 --> 01:56:00,801
than me,
even if it's just some sort of a 

2631
01:56:00,801 --> 01:56:00,801
chemical reaction in my mind.
Boy,

2632
01:56:00,801 --> 01:56:03,450
the ultimate wisdom displayed by that 
chemical reaction is not just tangible,

2633
01:56:03,451 --> 01:56:08,451
but it it.
You carry it with you the rest of your 

2634
01:56:08,451 --> 01:56:08,451
life.
You carry those thoughts and what you've

2635
01:56:08,451 --> 01:56:10,110
learned from those experiences the rest 
of your life,

2636
01:56:10,530 --> 01:56:13,560
and that's what they found is John 
Hopkins study on Siliciden mushrooms and

2637
01:56:13,561 --> 01:56:15,000
that's what you've experienced in your 
life.

2638
01:56:15,001 --> 01:56:20,001
That's what I've experienced in my life.
You can't tell me it's not happening 

2639
01:56:20,001 --> 01:56:20,001
that way.
You,

2640
01:56:20,001 --> 01:56:20,760
you're,
you're tuning into some other.

2641
01:56:20,830 --> 01:56:22,920
In incredible intelligence.
And you're going,

2642
01:56:22,980 --> 01:56:24,210
oh,
okay.

2643
01:56:24,270 --> 01:56:26,490
Like I was taking myself seriously.
I was being ridiculous.

2644
01:56:26,491 --> 01:56:28,530
I was thinking that was important.
I was thinking I was special.

2645
01:56:28,531 --> 01:56:29,520
I was thinking I was,
you know,

2646
01:56:29,540 --> 01:56:30,650
I was right.
And everyone's wrong.

2647
01:56:30,670 --> 01:56:35,670
Like Whoa,
you don't know Jack Shit and you have a 

2648
01:56:35,670 --> 01:56:37,110
few of those and you feel that I had 
this crazy dream a couple of weeks ago.

2649
01:56:37,960 --> 01:56:38,810
Uh,
I,

2650
01:56:38,970 --> 01:56:42,420
I was,
me and my girlfriend were at the house I

2651
01:56:42,421 --> 01:56:45,190
grew up in and she's in the back yard 
screaming.

2652
01:56:45,191 --> 01:56:45,980
It's nighttime.
It's,

2653
01:56:46,010 --> 01:56:47,610
it's late at night.
She's screaming,

2654
01:56:47,611 --> 01:56:48,920
come back here,
come back here.

2655
01:56:48,930 --> 01:56:50,700
And I felt like something was wrong with
the baby or something.

2656
01:56:51,020 --> 01:56:52,870
So I run out in the,
in the,

2657
01:56:52,900 --> 01:56:57,900
in the backyard and she's looking up at 
the sky and then I look up in the sky 

2658
01:56:57,900 --> 01:57:00,600
and then you see all these intelligent 
shooting stars like,

2659
01:57:00,830 --> 01:57:04,800
like it was full disclosure.
It's like all these low beams of light,

2660
01:57:04,801 --> 01:57:09,801
like with Algorithms and equations and 
chem trails in this fancy hand writing 

2661
01:57:10,291 --> 01:57:15,270
and chem trails in like hieroglyphics 
and all the answers.

2662
01:57:15,271 --> 01:57:17,910
And we're just standing there going,
shit,

2663
01:57:18,270 --> 01:57:20,880
all the equations,
it just came out like,

2664
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:21,980
what,
what,

2665
01:57:22,750 --> 01:57:25,440
what the hell on what were you on?
I was dreaming.

2666
01:57:25,620 --> 01:57:25,920
But what?

2667
01:57:25,920 --> 01:57:27,600
Did you take anything before you went to
bed?

2668
01:57:27,690 --> 01:57:28,860
No,
not.

2669
01:57:29,040 --> 01:57:31,710
I mean I smoked weed but I didn't take 
Alpha brain.

2670
01:57:31,711 --> 01:57:36,711
Eddie will give you a crazy lucid dream 
alpha brain commercial right there.

2671
01:57:38,041 --> 01:57:40,860
And Alpha brain gives you crazy lucid 
cut that shit.

2672
01:57:40,970 --> 01:57:45,970
And Howard,
will you take an Alpha brand when you 

2673
01:57:45,970 --> 01:57:45,970
have that?
No,

2674
01:57:45,970 --> 01:57:49,040
I've been taking.
I want you to have an extra bottle of 

2675
01:57:49,040 --> 01:57:49,040
wine.
I want.

2676
01:57:49,040 --> 01:57:50,010
I want your honest,
unbiased opinion about.

2677
01:57:50,020 --> 01:57:51,030
Definitely.
Definitely.

2678
01:57:51,210 --> 01:57:52,910
Definitely.
So what,

2679
01:57:52,920 --> 01:57:57,810
what would fucking happen if like there 
was just full disclosure,

2680
01:57:57,811 --> 01:58:01,620
like you just hear like aliens from the 
next star system just said,

2681
01:58:01,621 --> 01:58:02,970
okay,
this is what's going down.

2682
01:58:02,971 --> 01:58:04,680
You've been part of this,
you know,

2683
01:58:04,830 --> 01:58:06,600
breeding or,
or whatever.

2684
01:58:06,780 --> 01:58:09,540
You're part of this galactic federation.
It's 2012,

2685
01:58:09,720 --> 01:58:14,720
this is what's going on.
And the whole history of us was just 

2686
01:58:14,720 --> 01:58:19,250
thrust upon us.
Well imagine if our entire civilization 

2687
01:58:19,250 --> 01:58:23,121
was just the interstellar version of 
seaworld were seaworld for aliens.

2688
01:58:23,910 --> 01:58:26,400
Exactly,
so you find this out and they tell you,

2689
01:58:26,670 --> 01:58:28,980
they tell you,
I'm not only want to get into it because

2690
01:58:29,470 --> 01:58:33,510
it's just you don't want to get into it.
What do you mean?

2691
01:58:33,660 --> 01:58:36,270
No,
it's just I don't want to get into it,

2692
01:58:36,271 --> 01:58:37,620
but it just,
man,

2693
01:58:37,621 --> 01:58:42,621
what?
What's going to happen will happen 

2694
01:58:42,621 --> 01:58:42,621
eventually.
You said you don't want to get into it.

2695
01:58:42,621 --> 01:58:42,621
That's

2696
01:58:42,621 --> 01:58:44,560
a long story.
This guy came in the room and he started

2697
01:58:44,561 --> 01:58:46,210
taking off his clothes and I started 
slowly.

2698
01:58:46,230 --> 01:58:48,880
Secondly,
how would people react if,

2699
01:58:49,060 --> 01:58:53,650
because if the entire truth,
what if it wasn't even aliens?

2700
01:58:53,651 --> 01:58:54,940
What if like our government said,
okay,

2701
01:58:54,941 --> 01:58:59,941
this is what's going on.
This is the history of the solar system 

2702
01:58:59,941 --> 01:58:59,941
is the history of the Galactic 
Federation.

2703
01:58:59,980 --> 01:59:02,260
We're actually part of this giant 
federation.

2704
01:59:02,530 --> 01:59:07,530
We were just left alone for a few 
hundred thousand years to get to a 

2705
01:59:07,530 --> 01:59:07,530
certain point.
Now we're part of this.

2706
01:59:07,530 --> 01:59:11,650
Now we need to move everybody to another
planet because asteroids coming,

2707
01:59:11,651 --> 01:59:15,400
so we need to get on some fucking God 
damn ships and you know what I mean?

2708
01:59:15,401 --> 01:59:20,401
Like,
could you imagine if [inaudible] 

2709
01:59:20,401 --> 01:59:22,120
actually came from the ocean?
What if they all come from the ocean?

2710
01:59:22,150 --> 01:59:24,490
What if we don't know it?
Use teligent.

2711
01:59:24,520 --> 01:59:29,520
There's an intelligent species that is 
like way older than us that figured out 

2712
01:59:29,520 --> 01:59:33,010
the best way to exist is to dig trenches
deep into the ocean.

2713
01:59:33,010 --> 01:59:38,010
They have these deep underwater 
civilization so they're completely cut 

2714
01:59:38,010 --> 01:59:39,640
off from all the rest of the fish and 
all the wildlife,

2715
01:59:39,641 --> 01:59:41,470
so they got completely removed from the 
food chain,

2716
01:59:41,620 --> 01:59:45,250
much like we did by not living in the 
jungles and we moved in the cities.

2717
01:59:45,340 --> 01:59:50,340
They just built these fucking things 
down under ground and they became super 

2718
01:59:50,340 --> 01:59:53,701
sophisticated and they control their 
environment like no other animal in the 

2719
01:59:53,701 --> 01:59:55,330
ocean and they built fucking ships and 
shoot those ships out.

2720
01:59:56,890 --> 01:59:59,740
Another actually octopus and all the 
octopus that we see,

2721
01:59:59,760 --> 02:00:04,600
the ones that got away with spongebob.
If something came from another planet,

2722
02:00:04,601 --> 02:00:06,910
if something was so smart that it came 
from another planet,

2723
02:00:07,090 --> 02:00:08,950
you would think that it would be able to
hide itself.

2724
02:00:09,220 --> 02:00:14,220
You would think we're going to figure 
that out before we figure out 

2725
02:00:14,220 --> 02:00:17,790
interplanetary travel.
We're going to figure out cloaking 

2726
02:00:17,790 --> 02:00:17,790
because if you pay attention,
they're pretty close to clogging.

2727
02:00:17,790 --> 02:00:20,800
They figured out a way to make a tank 
that the broadcast something,

2728
02:00:20,801 --> 02:00:24,520
it projects it on the side of the tank 
so it looks like the walls behind it.

2729
02:00:24,670 --> 02:00:27,820
It's fucking crazy shit.
It's crazy shit.

2730
02:00:27,880 --> 02:00:30,340
So they're.
They're pretty close to figuring out how

2731
02:00:30,341 --> 02:00:34,120
to do that and make it look really good 
because if you think about the first one

2732
02:00:34,121 --> 02:00:36,070
megapixel camera,
I had one dude,

2733
02:00:36,071 --> 02:00:41,071
it was a brick,
was a one megapixel digital camera and 

2734
02:00:41,071 --> 02:00:44,431
it was a brick and now your phone has an
eight megapixel camera or more about 

2735
02:00:44,431 --> 02:00:49,080
when they master your thoughts and your 
dreams and you could sell your dreams 

2736
02:00:49,080 --> 02:00:51,910
and like bad ass dudes that are lucid,
lucid dreamers and they create amazing.

2737
02:00:51,911 --> 02:00:54,820
It's like fuck watching movies like 
movies or from moving.

2738
02:00:54,850 --> 02:00:58,000
It's like watching a martial arts movie 
like you want to mma now.

2739
02:00:58,001 --> 02:00:59,700
Why are we going to watch Jeff Speakman?

2740
02:00:59,770 --> 02:01:02,170
Why are we going to watch Steven Seagal?
We got the real shit.

2741
02:01:02,560 --> 02:01:04,810
And then when you start watching real 
dreams,

2742
02:01:04,811 --> 02:01:06,790
like you just download them,
boom.

2743
02:01:06,791 --> 02:01:09,250
Here's my shifts,
that movie that Juliette Lewis would,

2744
02:01:09,251 --> 02:01:12,530
if it was a dude was completely crazy 
and you run,

2745
02:01:12,580 --> 02:01:16,120
you run the risk of becoming crazy by 
following his dreams.

2746
02:01:16,320 --> 02:01:21,320
Like what?
There's a few dudes who are just 

2747
02:01:21,320 --> 02:01:21,320
fucking.
Their dreams are so awesome.

2748
02:01:21,320 --> 02:01:25,020
You like,
I'll fucking risk it and you want to 

2749
02:01:25,020 --> 02:01:25,020
ride dragons through the fucking cosmos 
and share.

2750
02:01:25,020 --> 02:01:30,000
This guy has these ridiculous vivid 
multicolor sorcerer.

2751
02:01:30,320 --> 02:01:35,320
When that,
when that technology has changed as the 

2752
02:01:35,320 --> 02:01:35,320
Australian shades,
it's similar to that.

2753
02:01:35,320 --> 02:01:40,200
When you got that technology like 
mastering your thoughts and your dreams 

2754
02:01:40,200 --> 02:01:40,200
into DVD

2755
02:01:40,200 --> 02:01:43,520
combined with virtual reality 
technology,

2756
02:01:43,790 --> 02:01:48,790
we're now you could get inside someone 
else's dream and then they'll do real 

2757
02:01:48,790 --> 02:01:51,020
time like,
like Web Cam Dreams,

2758
02:01:51,021 --> 02:01:54,050
like you go into their dreams as they're
dreaming.

2759
02:01:54,210 --> 02:01:59,210
Whether I should on that.
I was talking about from Gizmodo where 

2760
02:01:59,210 --> 02:01:59,210
they recorded the dreams.
That's very close to that.

2761
02:01:59,210 --> 02:01:59,710
Well,
you know it's going to be.

2762
02:01:59,780 --> 02:02:01,790
They've already done it.
When they have.

2763
02:02:02,150 --> 02:02:04,370
I want to see what the fuck that looks 
like.

2764
02:02:04,400 --> 02:02:08,570
What about when they figured out a way 
to actually force you to dream?

2765
02:02:08,840 --> 02:02:11,840
What if they figured out a way to 
trigger dreaming or if they figure out a

2766
02:02:11,841 --> 02:02:16,841
way to somehow or another they activate 
something in your mind and whatever 

2767
02:02:16,841 --> 02:02:18,560
chemicals that are released in whatever 
situation becomes artificial,

2768
02:02:18,561 --> 02:02:20,300
like instantaneous,
you know,

2769
02:02:20,330 --> 02:02:23,390
they can make you dream.
See,

2770
02:02:23,790 --> 02:02:28,790
this video is showing what they recorded
from some from brain activity on the 

2771
02:02:29,121 --> 02:02:31,460
right side while they're watching it.

2772
02:02:31,580 --> 02:02:36,580
Well,
the image of the fucking guy on the 

2773
02:02:36,771 --> 02:02:41,771
right side is what the brain is seeing 
on the left side is what the person's 

2774
02:02:41,771 --> 02:02:42,710
watch and that.
That's incredible.

2775
02:02:42,711 --> 02:02:45,200
It's insane.
It's on Gizmodo.

2776
02:02:45,630 --> 02:02:48,290
It's under A.
There's a lot of people that are worried

2777
02:02:48,291 --> 02:02:49,540
about this.
Gizmodo,

2778
02:02:49,590 --> 02:02:54,590
scientists reconstruct brains visions 
into digital video and that's a lot of 

2779
02:02:54,590 --> 02:02:58,991
people are worried about this,
worried about this ultimate conversion 

2780
02:02:58,991 --> 02:03:01,811
of people in machine and then it's 
happening way quicker than we think it 

2781
02:03:01,811 --> 02:03:01,811
is.
You know when,

2782
02:03:01,811 --> 02:03:06,101
when when you look up and you realize 
that stuff like that has taken place 

2783
02:03:06,101 --> 02:03:06,320
right under your nose and you didn't 
know about it.

2784
02:03:06,500 --> 02:03:07,700
They're like,
oh my God,

2785
02:03:07,760 --> 02:03:09,980
like what is next?
What is next?

2786
02:03:09,981 --> 02:03:13,260
Somehow or another we're going to be 
able to read each other's minds.

2787
02:03:13,261 --> 02:03:18,261
We're going to go right into each 
other's brains and we're all going to 

2788
02:03:18,261 --> 02:03:18,261
become one organism.

2789
02:03:18,261 --> 02:03:21,050
We're going to really recognize 
ourselves as one and talking is going to

2790
02:03:21,051 --> 02:03:23,240
be fucking for,
for idiots.

2791
02:03:23,530 --> 02:03:25,820
Just going to be telepathy,
telepathy,

2792
02:03:25,830 --> 02:03:30,830
one-on-one.
They're going to run into people that 

2793
02:03:30,830 --> 02:03:32,741
still talk.
We're going to be like Shannon ahead of 

2794
02:03:32,741 --> 02:03:32,741
them living in the bush.
In Australia,

2795
02:03:32,741 --> 02:03:37,340
we like talking my and that all people,
but without any facial expressions,

2796
02:03:37,341 --> 02:03:42,341
you just laughing your head and that's 
the time we could talk to the dolphins 

2797
02:03:42,341 --> 02:03:42,341
and the animals.
I be Dr doolittle.

2798
02:03:42,341 --> 02:03:43,280
Do you think that's what aliens stand 
for?

2799
02:03:43,281 --> 02:03:46,840
The archetype of the alien with the big 
giant head and the big eyes and the the,

2800
02:03:47,060 --> 02:03:52,060
the emotionless face,
all that emotion outside is all just 

2801
02:03:52,060 --> 02:03:56,171
necessarily only because we're shitty at
communicating and once we were able to 

2802
02:03:56,171 --> 02:03:58,590
communicate completely through the mind 
will need anything anymore out there.

2803
02:03:58,710 --> 02:04:01,310
So what do you think that represents?
It represents are inevitable.

2804
02:04:01,310 --> 02:04:03,680
Future are encoded end.
It's gotta be.

2805
02:04:03,710 --> 02:04:08,710
I wonder if that's just the way it goes.
Technology marches on and it makes 

2806
02:04:08,710 --> 02:04:10,490
staggering pace if you look at us 
compared to champs,

2807
02:04:10,491 --> 02:04:11,120
right?
I mean,

2808
02:04:11,121 --> 02:04:12,590
we're not done.
This is very,

2809
02:04:12,640 --> 02:04:15,350
it's very clear that human beings are 
some sort of a work in progress.

2810
02:04:15,590 --> 02:04:17,270
And if you look at us compared to 
chimps,

2811
02:04:17,420 --> 02:04:22,420
the big mystery in,
in the fossil record is the doubling of 

2812
02:04:22,420 --> 02:04:24,440
the human brain size that it doubled 
over a period of 2 million years.

2813
02:04:24,680 --> 02:04:26,150
And they don't know why.
They didn't know what it was.

2814
02:04:26,210 --> 02:04:29,170
But beyond that,
the old days,

2815
02:04:29,200 --> 02:04:29,720
no,
they were,

2816
02:04:30,410 --> 02:04:35,380
they wouldn't tell I'm.
It was too.

2817
02:04:36,330 --> 02:04:37,340
So they,
um,

2818
02:04:37,720 --> 02:04:38,090
if you

2819
02:04:38,430 --> 02:04:42,480
think about what,
what we became from the monkey origin,

2820
02:04:42,760 --> 02:04:44,030
the original,
you know,

2821
02:04:44,100 --> 02:04:46,050
lower prime,
what we became with our bigger head,

2822
02:04:46,200 --> 02:04:51,200
well if it's going to keep moving in 
that same direction were going to have 

2823
02:04:51,200 --> 02:04:53,630
big giant heads.
And if you look at the muscles that are 

2824
02:04:53,630 --> 02:04:55,971
on champs and then you look at a scrawny
ass average American male who doesn't 

2825
02:04:55,971 --> 02:04:58,170
exercise and just works on a fucking in 
a cubicle all day,

2826
02:04:58,400 --> 02:05:03,400
they're there.
They're scrawny body is very much like 

2827
02:05:03,400 --> 02:05:04,140
the scrawny body of an alien,
so if you keep going in that direction,

2828
02:05:04,170 --> 02:05:09,170
that's exactly what they come out like.
You come out like some fucking giant 

2829
02:05:09,170 --> 02:05:11,610
brainiac with little twig limbs that 
can't get anything done,

2830
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:17,000
no Jujitsu at all,
no everything you've ever happened you 

2831
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:20,220
can get with without a facial expression
and let that a sound without a peep.

2832
02:05:20,400 --> 02:05:21,330
You can get all that.

2833
02:05:21,510 --> 02:05:24,800
You have so much fun just in your head.
You just go into other people's head and

2834
02:05:24,801 --> 02:05:29,801
you just like,
you know going to go into a trance and 

2835
02:05:29,801 --> 02:05:30,900
you just get all this information and go
through all their memories.

2836
02:05:31,020 --> 02:05:32,850
You look at someone else and go through 
their child and go,

2837
02:05:32,851 --> 02:05:34,620
man,
I love hanging out with you,

2838
02:05:34,621 --> 02:05:39,621
but in telepathy,
just going through everyone's life 

2839
02:05:39,621 --> 02:05:39,621
window.
If that's darkness,

2840
02:05:40,140 --> 02:05:45,140
you learn to block your thought.
It'd be like the best restoration site 

2841
02:05:45,140 --> 02:05:48,810
to Eddie's and just wonder if that's 
what aliens on a wonder.

2842
02:05:48,811 --> 02:05:52,410
If aliens have figured out what they are
as real things that we're never going to

2843
02:05:52,411 --> 02:05:57,411
have real evidence about because they 
don't exist in this dimension and they 

2844
02:05:57,411 --> 02:06:01,191
interdimensional travel,
they just figured out how to tune into 

2845
02:06:01,191 --> 02:06:01,191
different dimensions so they can come 
here,

2846
02:06:01,191 --> 02:06:03,150
hang for a little while and fucking 
Vamos,

2847
02:06:03,360 --> 02:06:07,480
but they do it in a way that almost as 
undetectable or that our our,

2848
02:06:07,490 --> 02:06:10,470
our instruments can't really pick up 
because they're not even from here,

2849
02:06:10,620 --> 02:06:15,030
so they'll show up as ghosts of disks 
flying through the sky and we,

2850
02:06:15,160 --> 02:06:17,320
we barely registered because we're,
we're,

2851
02:06:17,321 --> 02:06:18,810
we're getting is like static.

2852
02:06:18,810 --> 02:06:23,810
It's like we're watching one station on 
TV and it's not quite tuned in and 

2853
02:06:23,810 --> 02:06:24,330
another one comes in and it's in 
Mexican.

2854
02:06:24,420 --> 02:06:26,070
That's what we're getting.
We're getting like some,

2855
02:06:26,100 --> 02:06:31,100
some,
some bleed over from another dimension 

2856
02:06:31,100 --> 02:06:32,010
and that's what Ufo is our.
Does Bob have a twitter?

2857
02:06:32,310 --> 02:06:34,050
Wouldn't that be cool to have one of 
your shows?

2858
02:06:34,950 --> 02:06:37,200
I think he's full of Shit.
He might be.

2859
02:06:37,201 --> 02:06:38,530
He knows a lot.
He knows a lot.

2860
02:06:38,550 --> 02:06:43,550
He's fascinating,
but I almost wonder if that guy's 

2861
02:06:43,550 --> 02:06:43,980
working for the government,
if he's disinflation agent because he,

2862
02:06:43,981 --> 02:06:46,020
um,
he lied about going to mit.

2863
02:06:46,260 --> 02:06:48,210
He lied to that shit that's like really 
traceable,

2864
02:06:48,540 --> 02:06:50,190
you know,
but then he says that,

2865
02:06:50,191 --> 02:06:51,060
uh,
the government,

2866
02:06:51,500 --> 02:06:56,500
his records,
but that's not true because they found 

2867
02:06:56,500 --> 02:06:58,720
school books from people who went to 
school with him supposedly that were in 

2868
02:06:58,720 --> 02:07:02,580
those classes and there's no bibles are 
because there's old versions of the mean

2869
02:07:02,590 --> 02:07:02,850
the west.

2870
02:07:02,850 --> 02:07:05,750
They went back in time and altered,
you know,

2871
02:07:05,760 --> 02:07:08,760
every single one of the areas that the 
government is not going to do,

2872
02:07:08,761 --> 02:07:12,570
that they would get hot.
So he didn't say anything like that.

2873
02:07:12,571 --> 02:07:14,190
Crazy.
He said he was like,

2874
02:07:14,191 --> 02:07:15,840
he said he saw like that could have 
easily.

2875
02:07:15,900 --> 02:07:17,900
We already know that there's like German
Ufo is,

2876
02:07:17,901 --> 02:07:19,620
there's probably some American one that 
he saw,

2877
02:07:19,621 --> 02:07:21,720
you know,
and it doesn't mean that it was alien as

2878
02:07:21,721 --> 02:07:24,180
kids.
We'd like some of US Air Force Ufo.

2879
02:07:24,181 --> 02:07:25,850
That's not what he's saying though.
What he's saying.

2880
02:07:25,851 --> 02:07:28,080
This is absolutely alien.
And the way when they were,

2881
02:07:28,470 --> 02:07:30,430
they were hired,
they were hired to back engineer it.

2882
02:07:30,810 --> 02:07:33,410
His whole story is,
if you don't know who Robert is,

2883
02:07:33,750 --> 02:07:35,130
Robert was our,
is a guy,

2884
02:07:35,260 --> 02:07:36,130
claimed to have worked

2885
02:07:36,130 --> 02:07:39,880
for area 51.
His story is he had this job there.

2886
02:07:39,881 --> 02:07:44,881
I became fascinated.
He was a scientist and they started 

2887
02:07:44,881 --> 02:07:45,010
helping him.
He started helping them work with their.

2888
02:07:45,020 --> 02:07:48,230
They're they're aliens.
They had these or these alien spacecraft

2889
02:07:48,250 --> 02:07:50,200
that they had and they were trying to 
reconstruct them,

2890
02:07:50,350 --> 02:07:53,140
but while this all was going on,
what they have to know everything you're

2891
02:07:53,141 --> 02:07:55,210
doing.
So they monitor all your phone calls and

2892
02:07:55,211 --> 02:07:58,170
they found out that his wife was 
cheating on him and so they like,

2893
02:07:58,171 --> 02:08:03,171
oh,
this motherfucker is going to be 

2894
02:08:03,171 --> 02:08:04,231
emotionally unstable.
We've got to kick them out of the 

2895
02:08:04,231 --> 02:08:04,231
program because he's got turmoil in his 
life.

2896
02:08:04,231 --> 02:08:09,060
So they fired him abruptly.
He didn't understand why they wouldn't 

2897
02:08:09,060 --> 02:08:12,721
explain to him why they fired him.
And so the guy started bringing his 

2898
02:08:12,721 --> 02:08:15,511
friends around to watch the UFOS get 
launched and that's when he got 

2899
02:08:15,511 --> 02:08:15,511
arrested.

2900
02:08:15,511 --> 02:08:16,210
And that's when he started telling a 
story.

2901
02:08:16,810 --> 02:08:21,810
He started telling a story about how he 
worked there and they hired him to 

2902
02:08:21,810 --> 02:08:24,151
baggage.
It sounds awesome when you listen to 

2903
02:08:24,151 --> 02:08:26,281
them talk and when he does,
when he breaks down science and all 

2904
02:08:26,281 --> 02:08:27,310
these equations and using it.
I mean,

2905
02:08:27,311 --> 02:08:28,710
man,
he's an amazing liar.

2906
02:08:28,720 --> 02:08:30,010
If he doesn't know what the fuck he's 
talking about,

2907
02:08:30,011 --> 02:08:35,011
but he's gone off with it.
He sends some incredible shit about 

2908
02:08:35,011 --> 02:08:38,101
antigravity and all this crazy shit.
It almost makes me think that he's a 

2909
02:08:38,101 --> 02:08:42,541
plant and that he's hired to do this 
because it makes us look silly because 

2910
02:08:43,181 --> 02:08:48,181
when you look into the guy and he says 
all these fantastic things and then you 

2911
02:08:48,181 --> 02:08:51,481
find out that he actually never really 
went to mit and he lied about his past 

2912
02:08:51,481 --> 02:08:55,051
and they can't find any record of him 
anywhere and maybe he worked at Los 

2913
02:08:55,051 --> 02:08:55,051
Alamos for,
you know,

2914
02:08:55,051 --> 02:08:57,190
who the fuck knows what he did there,
but he wasn't involved in any area.

2915
02:08:57,190 --> 02:08:58,650
50 one bullshit.
You know,

2916
02:08:58,750 --> 02:09:01,600
this is of course obviously what the 
government says with it,

2917
02:09:01,610 --> 02:09:03,640
but it,
it makes him look ridiculous.

2918
02:09:03,641 --> 02:09:06,190
It makes them look silly.
If he lied about where he went to school

2919
02:09:06,280 --> 02:09:10,390
and so maybe if you wanted to end 
speculation about,

2920
02:09:10,440 --> 02:09:15,440
you know,
at any particular area whether or not 

2921
02:09:15,440 --> 02:09:17,281
Ufos were there,
you have some guy tell some crazy story 

2922
02:09:17,281 --> 02:09:17,281
about it and then make sure that he's 
full of shit.

2923
02:09:17,530 --> 02:09:19,180
Make sure he's full of shit about other 
things.

2924
02:09:19,580 --> 02:09:24,580
So the people investigate when a 
fantastical story they have to 

2925
02:09:24,580 --> 02:09:24,580
investigate,
you know,

2926
02:09:24,580 --> 02:09:29,520
and they investigate and they find out 
that he's full of shit and it makes the 

2927
02:09:29,520 --> 02:09:29,520
whole thing seemed silly,
but we know for a fact they,

2928
02:09:29,520 --> 02:09:34,311
they,
they definitely test weapons there and 

2929
02:09:34,311 --> 02:09:34,540
there's videos that people have shot 
back before they,

2930
02:09:34,660 --> 02:09:37,620
they,
they extended the range of where it's,

2931
02:09:38,030 --> 02:09:39,400
you're prohibited to travel.

2932
02:09:39,500 --> 02:09:41,590
They used to be able to get much closer 
to area 51,

2933
02:09:41,591 --> 02:09:46,591
but people would go to the certain Ridge
and they would film all these different 

2934
02:09:46,591 --> 02:09:48,130
things flying through the air,
like the fucking crazy things taken.

2935
02:09:48,131 --> 02:09:50,500
All these right angle turns in the 
middle of the sky.

2936
02:09:50,800 --> 02:09:55,800
And what most people think is that 
that's where they were initially 

2937
02:09:55,800 --> 02:09:57,820
practicing with drones and that those 
things that were glowing in the sky,

2938
02:09:57,821 --> 02:10:02,821
the reason why they look like Ufo shows 
is like this is the reason why they 

2939
02:10:02,821 --> 02:10:02,821
moved so haphazardly,
threw this guy,

2940
02:10:02,821 --> 02:10:04,630
these roll radio controlled and they 
really hadn't,

2941
02:10:04,660 --> 02:10:08,500
didn't have it down yet.
And we know now they have drones down to

2942
02:10:08,501 --> 02:10:10,030
a science,
you know.

2943
02:10:10,031 --> 02:10:12,730
And now the drone technology has gotten 
to the point.

2944
02:10:12,731 --> 02:10:14,200
Yeah,
they killed that guy,

2945
02:10:14,201 --> 02:10:19,201
that American born a couple of them I 
guess lot drones move like they like 

2946
02:10:21,311 --> 02:10:24,440
those lights did a that they captured.
I don't know.

2947
02:10:25,240 --> 02:10:30,240
They seem to think so.
They seem to be just like model 

2948
02:10:30,240 --> 02:10:30,240
airplanes.

2949
02:10:31,570 --> 02:10:35,390
Well let's think about what these drones
are for these drones carrying missiles.

2950
02:10:35,420 --> 02:10:38,150
They will just the weight alone,
if you have something that it's,

2951
02:10:38,290 --> 02:10:40,300
you know,
like say if you have something and it's,

2952
02:10:40,610 --> 02:10:45,610
you're,
you're flying around some magnetic 

2953
02:10:45,610 --> 02:10:49,180
device,
some new next level antigravity fucking 

2954
02:10:49,180 --> 02:10:53,290
ball of steel.
And we figured out how to pilot this 

2955
02:10:53,290 --> 02:10:53,290
thing,
but it's not that accurate.

2956
02:10:53,300 --> 02:10:56,030
It works on magnetic waves when it's all
fucking nutty,

2957
02:10:56,180 --> 02:10:59,450
but it glows and it flies all around.
There's no one in it.

2958
02:10:59,451 --> 02:11:01,820
So can take crazy g force turns in the 
sky.

2959
02:11:02,300 --> 02:11:05,090
It's very possible that that's a 
completely different thing,

2960
02:11:05,091 --> 02:11:08,450
but that they learn from that and they,
they apply specific,

2961
02:11:08,630 --> 02:11:13,630
you know,
things that they learned from that into 

2962
02:11:13,630 --> 02:11:14,921
these other drones to make.
But the other drones that they make are 

2963
02:11:14,921 --> 02:11:14,921
often,
they're just based on,

2964
02:11:14,921 --> 02:11:14,921
you know,
uh,

2965
02:11:14,921 --> 02:11:17,600
artificially powered planes,
which they've had forever.

2966
02:11:17,600 --> 02:11:22,600
They've had.
And that was the part of operation 

2967
02:11:22,600 --> 02:11:24,341
northwoods.
They were going to blow up a drone 

2968
02:11:24,341 --> 02:11:24,341
plane.
They already had the ability to launch a

2969
02:11:24,341 --> 02:11:27,110
fucking plane into the sky just using a 
remote control.

2970
02:11:27,560 --> 02:11:28,940
So I think that,
uh,

2971
02:11:28,950 --> 02:11:29,550
it's,
it's,

2972
02:11:29,551 --> 02:11:34,551
it's,
it's entirely possible that all that 

2973
02:11:34,551 --> 02:11:36,281
shit that people saw around Nevada,
that's like things that the government 

2974
02:11:36,281 --> 02:11:38,921
experiment not,
and that you have a guy like Robert 

2975
02:11:38,921 --> 02:11:42,100
Lozar who comes in and says all this 
crazy shit about Ufo goes and turns out 

2976
02:11:42,100 --> 02:11:45,641
he's a liar.
And then it makes the whole idea of Ufo 

2977
02:11:45,641 --> 02:11:48,691
is being there to be nonsense.
And then people just want to leave it 

2978
02:11:48,691 --> 02:11:48,691
on.

2979
02:11:48,691 --> 02:11:48,691
I think it's more of a place where they 
are.

2980
02:11:48,691 --> 02:11:50,050
They keep seeds,
keep certain.

2981
02:11:50,051 --> 02:11:51,430
Like animals.
Almost like a.

2982
02:11:52,440 --> 02:11:54,400
yeah,
like a civilization.

2983
02:11:54,430 --> 02:11:58,410
Why do you think that they have to do 
that the government has to do now?

2984
02:11:58,450 --> 02:12:01,660
I mean don't you think they have like 
they've already bought like seeds.

2985
02:12:01,661 --> 02:12:05,590
Why's that government has already bought
like almost every single possible,

2986
02:12:05,770 --> 02:12:07,480
you know.
And that's to keep it,

2987
02:12:07,660 --> 02:12:10,660
isn't it,
to keep it like pure to like always have

2988
02:12:10,870 --> 02:12:12,220
heard this.
Were you getting this information?

2989
02:12:12,880 --> 02:12:17,880
I don't know.
I saw something online about how the 

2990
02:12:17,880 --> 02:12:17,880
government bought all the,
all the seeds.

2991
02:12:17,880 --> 02:12:22,741
So I'll have huge companies.
Noah's Ark situation or one company 

2992
02:12:22,741 --> 02:12:26,380
bought all these seeds and they got 
billions of seeds that they got stored.

2993
02:12:26,440 --> 02:12:31,440
Yeah,
that's like a news they got got Norway 

2994
02:12:31,440 --> 02:12:33,340
to seed storage giant.
So they preparing for the end of the.

2995
02:12:34,140 --> 02:12:37,150
Yeah,
I think that's probably what it is.

2996
02:12:37,151 --> 02:12:42,151
You know,
it's like just to be in the middle of 

2997
02:12:42,151 --> 02:12:44,401
the United States currently,
Norway has the biggest underground 

2998
02:12:44,401 --> 02:12:47,260
bunkers to over 33 square miles.
That's the rumor.

2999
02:12:47,980 --> 02:12:50,470
Norway's the biggest ticket.
How's the rumor?

3000
02:12:50,520 --> 02:12:54,400
I can house a million.
A million for two years.

3001
02:12:54,401 --> 02:12:55,070
Really?
Yep.

3002
02:12:55,340 --> 02:12:57,800
Well I know there's some place in the 
palm springs desert.

3003
02:12:57,801 --> 02:13:02,801
There's some guy,
they had them on TV and he was talking 

3004
02:13:02,801 --> 02:13:05,111
about and they've set up apartments 
there and people buy them a quarter 

3005
02:13:05,111 --> 02:13:06,610
million bucks.
And you own an apartment under ground.

3006
02:13:06,720 --> 02:13:07,380
Oh yeah,
they have that.

3007
02:13:07,381 --> 02:13:12,381
You can find that shit on the Internet.
Did abandoned missile silos that they're

3008
02:13:12,600 --> 02:13:15,900
making like communities and shit and 
they won't let just anybody.

3009
02:13:16,510 --> 02:13:19,740
I have a friend who actually looked into
it and wants to spend the money.

3010
02:13:20,130 --> 02:13:25,130
The problem is is you get there how you 
going to get there when like a fucking 

3011
02:13:25,500 --> 02:13:30,500
tidal wave comes or even if you.
Even if you could get there like you 

3012
02:13:30,500 --> 02:13:34,851
bought.
There's like the communities that 

3013
02:13:34,851 --> 02:13:34,851
they're building

3014
02:13:34,851 --> 02:13:35,520
and do you have to have some kind of 
skill to have to even buy one?

3015
02:13:35,521 --> 02:13:37,800
Like how are you going to contribute to 
this community?

3016
02:13:37,801 --> 02:13:39,630
So you've got to pass all these tests 
and these interviews.

3017
02:13:39,820 --> 02:13:44,820
Yeah.
And then they take like 50 grand or 

3018
02:13:44,820 --> 02:13:46,581
whatever.
Like when Shit goes down and I'm at the 

3019
02:13:46,581 --> 02:13:50,391
front door,
are you going to open the Goddamn door 

3020
02:13:50,391 --> 02:13:50,391
for me?
You know what I mean?

3021
02:13:50,391 --> 02:13:54,201
How do I.
The only way that would work is if 

3022
02:13:54,201 --> 02:13:55,530
everyone had their own private entrance 
and you add your own key to it,

3023
02:13:56,040 --> 02:13:58,290
you know what I mean?
But fuck,

3024
02:13:58,350 --> 02:14:01,440
you open up the door and then the horde 
of zombies came in behind you and killed

3025
02:14:01,441 --> 02:14:02,670
everybody in the.
Yeah.

3026
02:14:02,740 --> 02:14:07,740
Yeah.
I could totally seem like don't fucking 

3027
02:14:07,740 --> 02:14:07,740
open the door for nobody.
Shit went down.

3028
02:14:07,740 --> 02:14:08,090
Complex is.
Remember when you lived.

3029
02:14:08,100 --> 02:14:13,100
If you ever Linda apartment complex,
someone leaves the door open and people 

3030
02:14:13,100 --> 02:14:13,100
get in and break into people's houses 
and that's what happens.

3031
02:14:13,100 --> 02:14:13,700
Yeah.
Yeah.

3032
02:14:13,730 --> 02:14:15,540
Like that wouldn't trust that they'll 
take your money.

3033
02:14:15,541 --> 02:14:18,450
Now that seems too sketchy.
Unless you live in it.

3034
02:14:18,690 --> 02:14:20,910
Last year a compound guy,
like you got a house,

3035
02:14:21,150 --> 02:14:21,960
like do you remember?
Um,

3036
02:14:22,020 --> 02:14:27,020
I don't know if you heard about this.
There was a house in Italy and they 

3037
02:14:27,020 --> 02:14:29,361
suspected this guy of having some sort 
of an underground military bunker 

3038
02:14:29,361 --> 02:14:32,730
because he had moved a bunch of dirt out
of there and it had been years and years

3039
02:14:32,731 --> 02:14:35,520
of construction and so the Italian 
government threatened him.

3040
02:14:35,521 --> 02:14:36,060
They're like,
dude,

3041
02:14:36,061 --> 02:14:38,640
we're going to burn your fucking house 
down and kill you.

3042
02:14:38,820 --> 02:14:40,530
Like tell us what the fuck is going on 
in your basement.

3043
02:14:40,531 --> 02:14:41,910
Like they were threatened by this guy.
Well,

3044
02:14:41,911 --> 02:14:46,911
they went into his basement and he had 
this incredible artistically designed 

3045
02:14:46,911 --> 02:14:48,750
temple.
There's all different styles of art.

3046
02:14:48,751 --> 02:14:50,310
When I say artistically designed,
it was.

3047
02:14:50,311 --> 02:14:52,010
It wasn't like by happenstance,
they.

3048
02:14:52,190 --> 02:14:57,190
It was like engineered and plan this 
huge caverns like thousands and 

3049
02:14:57,190 --> 02:15:01,370
thousands and thousands of square feet 
and it's like one rooms and Egyptian 

3050
02:15:01,370 --> 02:15:02,430
theme and the other room is in this 
incredible other beautiful theme.

3051
02:15:02,890 --> 02:15:04,320
Was he preparing for the end of the 
world?

3052
02:15:04,380 --> 02:15:06,450
I don't know what he built this fucking 
thing under his house.

3053
02:15:06,660 --> 02:15:09,360
Like he built a whole different world 
under his house.

3054
02:15:09,420 --> 02:15:11,820
It's amazing.
It's amazing.

3055
02:15:12,200 --> 02:15:14,100
You know,
people are always trying to build things

3056
02:15:14,520 --> 02:15:18,180
and hide from people because they're 
worried about the inevitable collapse.

3057
02:15:18,330 --> 02:15:20,700
Just get a nice spot down in the middle 
of the earth.

3058
02:15:21,590 --> 02:15:26,550
Air is pumped up through a straw.
It definitely building bigger and bigger

3059
02:15:26,551 --> 02:15:28,860
bunkers and they're turning into cities.
That's just natural.

3060
02:15:28,861 --> 02:15:31,050
If I had all the,
if I was the ruler of the world,

3061
02:15:31,080 --> 02:15:33,150
I would just have people on the case 
nonstop.

3062
02:15:33,240 --> 02:15:35,970
Keep building that shit deeper and 
deeper and deeper.

3063
02:15:35,970 --> 02:15:37,410
Keep building it.
You know what I mean?

3064
02:15:37,411 --> 02:15:41,760
Because if you're running shit and you 
have the power and unlimited resource to

3065
02:15:41,761 --> 02:15:45,840
build some safety,
of course it's natural human behavior.

3066
02:15:45,990 --> 02:15:49,230
It's the human condition to dig 
underground and be safe.

3067
02:15:49,350 --> 02:15:54,350
If you could,
if you could have had all the money 

3068
02:15:54,350 --> 02:15:54,350
shit,
just literally,

3069
02:15:54,350 --> 02:15:57,840
if you're doing that though,
you literally might be some of the last 

3070
02:15:57,840 --> 02:16:00,561
people on Earth.
What a crazy responsibility that would 

3071
02:16:00,561 --> 02:16:01,440
feel if you knew that the whole world 
got wiped out,

3072
02:16:01,441 --> 02:16:04,230
but you were inside some fucking thing.
And uh,

3073
02:16:04,520 --> 02:16:05,790
there was a,
you know,

3074
02:16:05,791 --> 02:16:07,860
you,
you had a 90 percent chance and once you

3075
02:16:07,861 --> 02:16:12,861
got out,
the radiation had died down enough so 

3076
02:16:12,861 --> 02:16:12,861
that you can survive.
You just got it.

3077
02:16:12,861 --> 02:16:13,440
We got to survive two years under there.
If you,

3078
02:16:13,441 --> 02:16:15,510
if the government came up to and said,
Joe,

3079
02:16:15,810 --> 02:16:20,470
we need you to keep your mouth shut.
You and your family can all come back to

3080
02:16:20,500 --> 02:16:21,480
you.
You got to pass.

3081
02:16:21,481 --> 02:16:24,270
We got the asteroid,
the asteroid gets comment,

3082
02:16:24,271 --> 02:16:26,940
but you just gotTa shut up about it.
It's can we just can't see it?

3083
02:16:26,941 --> 02:16:28,860
Everybody.
We can't fit everybody in.

3084
02:16:28,861 --> 02:16:30,310
You and your family just just

3085
02:16:30,460 --> 02:16:31,780
pipe down.
I never thought of it that way.

3086
02:16:31,781 --> 02:16:34,510
Like if you just do it,
if you were creating wonder who you want

3087
02:16:34,511 --> 02:16:36,700
to live with,
if you were creating a union family,

3088
02:16:36,960 --> 02:16:39,810
it might be better to just die.
It might be better to find out where the

3089
02:16:39,811 --> 02:16:41,150
asteroid's gonna hit and drive.
There

3090
02:16:43,180 --> 02:16:47,750
might be the movement living underground
with a bunch of fucking other second.

3091
02:16:47,790 --> 02:16:51,190
Naturally where we have that drive we 
want to live.

3092
02:16:51,200 --> 02:16:53,280
I hope we're always reaching out no 
matter what.

3093
02:16:53,281 --> 02:16:55,920
We're trying to learn responsibility to 
keep this race going.

3094
02:16:55,980 --> 02:16:58,740
I never thought about it like involving,
if you're creating a noah's Ark,

3095
02:16:58,770 --> 02:17:01,320
what animals you would eat because you 
wouldn't do every single animal.

3096
02:17:01,321 --> 02:17:03,030
You would keep the ones that were the 
most important,

3097
02:17:03,210 --> 02:17:06,880
like chickens do nothing but buttons and
just ran.

3098
02:17:07,320 --> 02:17:08,930
It'd be chickens,
cows.

3099
02:17:09,160 --> 02:17:14,160
The idea of being able to actually hold 
all the animals in one place is 

3100
02:17:14,160 --> 02:17:14,770
ridiculous.
However,

3101
02:17:14,860 --> 02:17:19,860
the idea of being able to hold the 
genetic information for all the animals 

3102
02:17:19,860 --> 02:17:23,041
in one place is absolutely doable.
And so that's what if there was ever a 

3103
02:17:23,041 --> 02:17:25,090
noah's Ark and the real life past of 
humanity,

3104
02:17:25,360 --> 02:17:30,360
what it is,
probably a DNA bank and that at one 

3105
02:17:30,360 --> 02:17:30,360
point in time,
you know,

3106
02:17:30,370 --> 02:17:35,370
there was a high level of intelligence.
That was when the Graham Hancock was on.

3107
02:17:35,381 --> 02:17:36,310
It was talking about,
uh,

3108
02:17:36,780 --> 02:17:37,840
intelligence,
uh,

3109
02:17:37,860 --> 02:17:42,860
the must have reached very high levels 
and then got wiped out by some huge 

3110
02:17:42,860 --> 02:17:46,381
natural disaster.
And then people were sort of left to 

3111
02:17:46,381 --> 02:17:46,381
fend for themselves and kind of refigure
things out.

3112
02:17:46,381 --> 02:17:48,250
Some things never get figured out again,
man.

3113
02:17:48,460 --> 02:17:53,460
Some people reached a certain direction,
a certain level and they reached it in 

3114
02:17:53,460 --> 02:17:57,751
Egypt and you know,
and 3000 BC and we still haven't hit 

3115
02:17:57,751 --> 02:17:57,751
that yet.
Yeah,

3116
02:17:57,751 --> 02:17:58,930
that makes sense to me that,
that,

3117
02:17:58,940 --> 02:18:01,150
that makes a lot of sense to me.
You know,

3118
02:18:01,240 --> 02:18:06,240
I don't know that.
I mean I know that my genes would want 

3119
02:18:06,240 --> 02:18:06,240
to keep going.
I would want to keep going.

3120
02:18:06,240 --> 02:18:10,531
I wouldn't want to put man.
What kind of a life with that being the 

3121
02:18:10,531 --> 02:18:11,180
post apocalyptic life that would suck 
up.

3122
02:18:11,270 --> 02:18:13,150
I would definitely do it.
I would want to.

3123
02:18:13,151 --> 02:18:14,790
I would try to live.
Yeah,

3124
02:18:14,830 --> 02:18:16,450
I think I would too.
I would to,

3125
02:18:16,480 --> 02:18:17,800
but fuck it would suck.

3126
02:18:18,230 --> 02:18:20,300
God Damn.
You were just supposed to try to make as

3127
02:18:20,301 --> 02:18:22,670
many babies as possible.
So you just had to find any girl.

3128
02:18:22,671 --> 02:18:25,220
You candidates come in and just like 
that.

3129
02:18:25,221 --> 02:18:25,880
That'd be awesome.

3130
02:18:27,250 --> 02:18:30,340
Isn't it amazing that our terror 
terrified world.

3131
02:18:30,341 --> 02:18:33,520
What's the terror of the terrified world
is that we would lose all of this.

3132
02:18:34,150 --> 02:18:37,720
We lose everything that we can bang on.
We could lose a houses and we'd be stuck

3133
02:18:37,721 --> 02:18:41,020
with just needing to forage for food.
He can't go to stores.

3134
02:18:41,140 --> 02:18:43,060
We don't have trucks and start over.
Everything.

3135
02:18:43,061 --> 02:18:43,800
Start over,
start over.

3136
02:18:43,850 --> 02:18:48,850
We're terrified of starting over.
Every other animal starts over every 

3137
02:18:48,850 --> 02:18:49,840
fucking day of the week.
We're terrified of it.

3138
02:18:49,841 --> 02:18:50,260
We,
we,

3139
02:18:50,261 --> 02:18:55,261
we are so connected to devices and 
inventions and technology that the idea 

3140
02:18:56,531 --> 02:19:00,490
of being alone in nature forever is 
fucking horrific.

3141
02:19:01,150 --> 02:19:02,530
That's horrific.
That's jail.

3142
02:19:02,620 --> 02:19:07,620
He'd rather go to jail and get fed four 
square meals a day and at least if your 

3143
02:19:07,620 --> 02:19:07,630
bunkie he's a good guy,
you know,

3144
02:19:07,631 --> 02:19:09,610
he can play chess together.
You know

3145
02:19:10,180 --> 02:19:11,170
what,
if you were allowed,

3146
02:19:11,260 --> 02:19:13,540
like if the government said,
okay,

3147
02:19:13,780 --> 02:19:15,820
we got one year,
this motherfucker is going to hit us.

3148
02:19:15,850 --> 02:19:20,850
Everybody build your own bunker in the 
backyard and just everyone just started 

3149
02:19:20,850 --> 02:19:20,850
building.
I'll go,

3150
02:19:21,160 --> 02:19:24,010
you know how you know how rich Mexicans 
would be?

3151
02:19:25,270 --> 02:19:27,070
That'd be charged in a lot of money,
man.

3152
02:19:27,530 --> 02:19:27,980
Why?

3153
02:19:28,430 --> 02:19:33,430
Because that would be the ones doing it.
They'd be the ones that'd be charging 

3154
02:19:33,430 --> 02:19:36,590
150 an hour.
They'd want their own bunker man.

3155
02:19:36,591 --> 02:19:37,400
They'd be like,
fuck you,

3156
02:19:37,401 --> 02:19:39,290
money doesn't mean anything with an 
asteroid's coming,

3157
02:19:39,320 --> 02:19:40,910
and they tell you how deep it's gotta 
be.

3158
02:19:40,940 --> 02:19:41,960
It's gotta be,
you know,

3159
02:19:41,980 --> 02:19:44,600
they already have their tunnels 30 yards
deep.

3160
02:19:45,150 --> 02:19:45,890
No,
it's common.

3161
02:19:45,891 --> 02:19:48,140
You got one year.
Everybody would be digging,

3162
02:19:48,141 --> 02:19:49,910
man.
They'd have instructions.

3163
02:19:50,120 --> 02:19:52,670
Everyone has their instructions from the
government.

3164
02:19:52,671 --> 02:19:54,170
Build your own shit.
You have a year.

3165
02:19:54,200 --> 02:19:59,200
Could you imagine if you were 
underground and everyone's locked down 

3166
02:19:59,200 --> 02:20:02,291
and you're all waiting as a countdown 
and you know that it's supposed to 

3167
02:20:02,291 --> 02:20:02,570
happen within the minute video,
cameras,

3168
02:20:03,380 --> 02:20:04,040
video,
cameras.

3169
02:20:04,041 --> 02:20:07,230
You're in a bunker and underground.
You just bump.

3170
02:20:07,820 --> 02:20:09,650
You're waiting for the impact of the 
earth.

3171
02:20:12,280 --> 02:20:17,280
Just feel the whole thing.
Could you imagine what you say that the 

3172
02:20:18,140 --> 02:20:21,020
one that killed the dinosaurs,
when it hit the earth,

3173
02:20:21,050 --> 02:20:25,190
it was five miles deep in the first,
second and a half,

3174
02:20:26,210 --> 02:20:31,210
the first,
second and a half and went five miles 

3175
02:20:31,210 --> 02:20:33,611
deep into the earth,
and these are the same people that 

3176
02:20:33,611 --> 02:20:34,510
measured the brain from that long,
from the caveman timer.

3177
02:20:35,060 --> 02:20:40,060
No regular done.
Those totally different types of 

3178
02:20:40,060 --> 02:20:41,940
science.
You fuckhead they just talk about how,

3179
02:20:41,941 --> 02:20:44,180
what an impact that must have been like,
you know,

3180
02:20:44,190 --> 02:20:45,800
and if you were right there,
you're fucked.

3181
02:20:45,980 --> 02:20:48,950
But if you will on the other side and 
your three mile deep bunker,

3182
02:20:49,010 --> 02:20:50,200
five miles deep,
Yo,

3183
02:20:50,240 --> 02:20:51,080
you know,
I do.

3184
02:20:51,260 --> 02:20:53,890
How much oxygen would you need for the,
you,

3185
02:20:53,920 --> 02:20:56,690
you'd have to have plants,
but would that even work?

3186
02:20:56,840 --> 02:21:01,820
Could you like have an environment 
underground where you had plants and you

3187
02:21:01,821 --> 02:21:05,030
generated electricity so that you could 
give the light sun,

3188
02:21:05,120 --> 02:21:09,140
artificial sunlight to the plants and 
the plants cleaned up the carbon dioxide

3189
02:21:09,141 --> 02:21:11,030
that you breathed out and gave you 
oxygen.

3190
02:21:11,240 --> 02:21:16,240
Would that be possible?
Could you develop an environment like 

3191
02:21:16,240 --> 02:21:16,240
that?
I don't know.

3192
02:21:16,240 --> 02:21:18,350
I wonder if they could do that.
If they could figure out a way,

3193
02:21:18,560 --> 02:21:19,720
if there was a,
uh,

3194
02:21:19,730 --> 02:21:22,460
some method of power that they could 
harness,

3195
02:21:22,461 --> 02:21:24,650
like say if they had some sort of an 
underground reactor.

3196
02:21:24,890 --> 02:21:29,890
So they got this underground reactor and
they got this up for the fact that will 

3197
02:21:29,890 --> 02:21:30,620
work for x amount of years and blah,
blah blah.

3198
02:21:30,770 --> 02:21:33,890
And they have a whole artificial world 
down there.

3199
02:21:33,920 --> 02:21:36,680
And this reactor runs these lights and 
it,

3200
02:21:36,681 --> 02:21:41,681
it,
they make it rain on these plants and 

3201
02:21:41,681 --> 02:21:41,681
the plants breathe in,
breathe out oxygen,

3202
02:21:41,681 --> 02:21:44,400
and we breathe out carbon dioxide and 
they live off that chapter one.

3203
02:21:44,480 --> 02:21:48,560
Everyone makes their own underground 
bunker and we've figured out a way like,

3204
02:21:48,561 --> 02:21:49,730
you know,
like we have a power source.

3205
02:21:49,731 --> 02:21:52,160
It's gonna last for,
for two years or whatever.

3206
02:21:52,170 --> 02:21:55,460
We could communicate with other people 
on like these walkie talkies and shared.

3207
02:21:55,670 --> 02:21:59,240
And then you start digging to them and 
you make like little tunnels to them and

3208
02:21:59,241 --> 02:22:04,241
shit.
Other people try to Jackie with their 

3209
02:22:04,241 --> 02:22:04,241
time.
I was like,

3210
02:22:04,241 --> 02:22:04,241
dude,
I don't want you in my life.

3211
02:22:04,241 --> 02:22:04,460
Do just go back.
Boom.

3212
02:22:04,660 --> 02:22:06,290
Yeah.
What happens when they get like rabbits,

3213
02:22:06,291 --> 02:22:08,610
Jack and tunnels when people's towels 
cross.

3214
02:22:09,310 --> 02:22:10,610
Put Gates on your toes.

3215
02:22:13,040 --> 02:22:15,590
Where does all the poop go?
People just show up and tell him,

3216
02:22:15,591 --> 02:22:15,920
no,
dude,

3217
02:22:15,921 --> 02:22:20,090
I live in a totally gay bars and these 
guard gated tunnel.

3218
02:22:20,630 --> 02:22:21,800
That could be crazy.
Right?

3219
02:22:22,650 --> 02:22:23,600
Well,
it's possible.

3220
02:22:23,660 --> 02:22:26,820
It's underground man for breaking into 
your shit all the time from underneath.

3221
02:22:26,850 --> 02:22:28,860
Terrible.
If the power goes out under there.

3222
02:22:28,920 --> 02:22:30,810
Oh,
what a horrible way to die,

3223
02:22:31,340 --> 02:22:32,010
you know,
you wouldn't have.

3224
02:22:32,210 --> 02:22:34,820
I wouldn't have a surrender is ready to 
go for everyone in my family.

3225
02:22:34,850 --> 02:22:37,800
I'll have a syringe if some shit goes 
down to shoot that motherfucker,

3226
02:22:38,810 --> 02:22:41,400
you know,
just go to sleep and just fuck it.

3227
02:22:41,490 --> 02:22:46,490
And on that note,
thanks Eddie.

3228
02:22:47,160 --> 02:22:48,660
We didn't even say your name.
Eddie Bravo.

3229
02:22:50,290 --> 02:22:54,450
We just started talking.
I want to be in Montreal in October,

3230
02:22:54,451 --> 02:22:56,790
late October.
I'm going to be a 10th planet Vista.

3231
02:22:57,140 --> 02:23:00,270
Go to Nibiru,
the Nibiru Forum at Tenth Planet J.

3232
02:23:00,290 --> 02:23:05,290
J Dot Com.
All my seminar information's there and 

3233
02:23:05,290 --> 02:23:05,290
thank you very much.

3234
02:23:05,290 --> 02:23:09,560
What was that?
I had a special effect on the song from 

3235
02:23:09,560 --> 02:23:10,800
Montreal coming.
You're so silly this Friday.

3236
02:23:10,830 --> 02:23:11,820
Houston,
Texas.

3237
02:23:12,090 --> 02:23:17,090
The verizon wireless theater.
But Brendan Walsh and Joey Diaz were 

3238
02:23:17,090 --> 02:23:18,090
coming.
Correct?

3239
02:23:18,720 --> 02:23:22,290
We're slinging Dick and passing out 
bubble gum as Joey Diaz would say.

3240
02:23:22,590 --> 02:23:24,780
Nice.
She got to walk on ice.

3241
02:23:24,781 --> 02:23:27,420
You might as well dance on St Louis in 
November.

3242
02:23:27,710 --> 02:23:28,950
Um,
Australia.

3243
02:23:28,951 --> 02:23:31,290
Melbourne in December.
I'm going to do with your website.

3244
02:23:31,291 --> 02:23:31,980
They're not gonna.
Remember this?

3245
02:23:31,981 --> 02:23:34,320
Where's your website?
Tenth Planet j Dot j Dot Com.

3246
02:23:34,321 --> 02:23:38,670
Shizam go to the forum and those if you 
looking for a place to train legends and

3247
02:23:38,671 --> 02:23:41,700
Hollywood is where it all goes down.
Come to California.

3248
02:23:41,880 --> 02:23:42,630
Where?
Where's the.

3249
02:23:42,650 --> 02:23:46,980
What's the address?
Fifty one 76 Santa Monica Boulevard.

3250
02:23:47,070 --> 02:23:49,470
It's on the east side of Hollywood.
Big Ass gym.

3251
02:23:49,471 --> 02:23:51,360
We got x poll there.
We got pulled dances,

3252
02:23:51,361 --> 02:23:53,740
we got a Jujitsu.
I teach you to Jitsu there.

3253
02:23:53,741 --> 02:23:54,960
That's 10 planet headquarters.

3254
02:23:54,960 --> 02:23:59,160
We've got an excellent kickboxing gym.
We've got an awesome NMA team.

3255
02:23:59,161 --> 02:24:04,161
Chris Riley is the MMA coach.
He's the head coach for the legends MMA 

3256
02:24:04,161 --> 02:24:06,360
team.
It's even has creepy coed locker rooms.

3257
02:24:06,480 --> 02:24:08,560
Yeah,
so one of the real estate.

3258
02:24:08,570 --> 02:24:13,570
Yeah,
it's the weirdest shit of all time and 

3259
02:24:13,570 --> 02:24:13,920
strippers or training,
training with the animals.

3260
02:24:14,220 --> 02:24:17,400
It's done on purpose.
The dudes are taken gnarly shit and they

3261
02:24:17,401 --> 02:24:18,660
get out and girls are waiting to get in 
there.

3262
02:24:18,840 --> 02:24:22,560
I have more than one time taking a 
gnarly shit and then you get out in some

3263
02:24:22,561 --> 02:24:25,370
poor girls waiting to get in there and 
the bathroom like.

3264
02:24:25,380 --> 02:24:26,490
All right,
good luck with that.

3265
02:24:27,210 --> 02:24:28,330
Good luck.
We had.

3266
02:24:28,400 --> 02:24:30,060
We actually,
I didn't know this until recently,

3267
02:24:30,061 --> 02:24:33,600
but we actually have the biggest strip 
pole class,

3268
02:24:33,601 --> 02:24:36,780
like we have the longest poles.
That's what he said.

3269
02:24:37,170 --> 02:24:38,820
And uh,
I didn't know that.

3270
02:24:38,821 --> 02:24:43,140
I didn't know we had the most ultimate 
goal dancing school ensured to the gills

3271
02:24:43,141 --> 02:24:45,370
from chicks falling on their heads 
prize.

3272
02:24:45,390 --> 02:24:47,370
It doesn't happen,
but that Anderson Cooper thing,

3273
02:24:47,371 --> 02:24:52,371
Anderson Cooper's got a new daytime talk
show and he had some kid doing some 

3274
02:24:52,371 --> 02:24:55,791
skateboard stunt.
The kid fell on his head and he's in 

3275
02:24:55,791 --> 02:24:55,791
critical condition.
Oh,

3276
02:24:55,791 --> 02:24:56,490
she's fucked up.
The producers like,

3277
02:24:56,730 --> 02:24:58,650
show something crazy.
I know you can do something crazy.

3278
02:24:58,860 --> 02:25:03,860
So the kid does something crazy and 
falls and lands on his fucking head on 

3279
02:25:03,860 --> 02:25:03,960
the show.
We didn't use it.

3280
02:25:03,961 --> 02:25:06,150
They didn't air it,
but they did it for the show.

3281
02:25:06,390 --> 02:25:08,520
Wow.
Don't listen to Anderson Cooper.

3282
02:25:09,000 --> 02:25:11,100
Okay.
If he tells you to get crazy,

3283
02:25:11,490 --> 02:25:13,980
think about what you're doing.
That's all I got to say.

3284
02:25:16,800 --> 02:25:21,800
The loop.
I missed the loop fucking shows over 

3285
02:25:21,800 --> 02:25:21,800
folks.
Thank you to the flashlight.

3299

3300
02:25:56,500 --> 02:25:58,060

3306
02:26:07,991 --> 02:26:09,700
That's the small rooms.
I'm in love with that small room.

3307
02:26:09,701 --> 02:26:14,701
That 85 seater.
We're going to be there a lot more 

3308
02:26:14,701 --> 02:26:14,701
