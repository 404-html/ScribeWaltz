1
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:08,820
Three you started at three to ah,
tricky

2
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,350
and we're live.
Hi Julie.

3
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:16,590
I'm doing that.
What's happening?

4
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,930
We were just talking before this podcast
started at a year.

5
00:00:18,931 --> 00:00:21,890
We were working on your masters in 
nonfiction,

6
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:24,510
shin creative writing,
creative nonfiction.

7
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,610
What does creative nonfiction,
how's that work?

8
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:27,713
It's actually very encompassing of a lot
of things to think about like memoir or 

9
00:00:32,251 --> 00:00:35,520
biography essays especially where a 
bunch of Sas,

10
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:39,330
we're a bunch of nerds.
They pick about I think nine or 10 of us

11
00:00:39,331 --> 00:00:42,750
out of a group of 150 for this program.
And then,

12
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:43,584
um,
we write a ton of essays and we read so 

13
00:00:45,721 --> 00:00:46,920
much.
It's insane.

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,820
It's amazing how many female MMA 
fighters,

15
00:00:49,821 --> 00:00:50,654
not that this is a knock against male 
mma fighters are like really fucking 

16
00:00:53,841 --> 00:00:55,810
smart.
Like Rosie Sexton,

17
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,160
you know,
there's like,

18
00:00:58,161 --> 00:00:59,690
there's a ton of them.
You can go down the list.

19
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:00,830
Yeah.
Peggy Morgan,

20
00:01:00,831 --> 00:01:01,730
she's got,
yeah,

21
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:04,730
the really intelligent female fighters.
I think that,

22
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:05,803
um,
I think there's something with mma and 

23
00:01:07,071 --> 00:01:07,904
creativity and I think whereas,
because the opportunities maybe haven't 

24
00:01:11,031 --> 00:01:13,460
been out there for women as much when it
comes to like,

25
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:16,790
I guess finding an avenue for that 
creativity there,

26
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:19,550
you know,
they go into other things like academics

27
00:01:19,551 --> 00:01:22,640
and arts and then they find mma and then
they try to do both.

28
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:24,290
I wonder if it's that,
oh,

29
00:01:24,291 --> 00:01:25,124
I mean,
I think there's probably a bunch of 

30
00:01:25,641 --> 00:01:26,900
reason.
Roxanne metaphoric.

31
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:28,790
That's another one.
She's super smart.

32
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:33,560
I always wonder if it's like,
maybe it's such an odd thing,

33
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:35,450
especially when you started,
I mean,

34
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:37,490
you're a real pioneer in a lot of ways.
I mean,

35
00:01:37,491 --> 00:01:39,980
you fought Gina Carano in 2007,
10 years ago,

36
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:42,950
long time ago.
It's crazy when you think about it.

37
00:01:42,951 --> 00:01:45,950
You know,
mma was like nonexistent in the public's

38
00:01:45,951 --> 00:01:46,784
fear back then.
It just wasn't something that people 

39
00:01:47,841 --> 00:01:48,674
talked about for women.
But the women that did get into it and 

40
00:01:51,201 --> 00:01:54,710
it reached like a professional level,
they have to be like extremely danger.

41
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:55,820
Daring you,
I mean,

42
00:01:55,821 --> 00:01:58,250
it's a,
it's a kind of a crazy occupation.

43
00:01:58,340 --> 00:01:59,030
It is.
It's,

44
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:02,030
um,
and I think that those of us who started

45
00:02:02,031 --> 00:02:02,691
back then,
of course,

46
00:02:02,691 --> 00:02:03,524
I'm not knocking the people who are 
doing it now because there are 

47
00:02:04,971 --> 00:02:06,140
tremendous athletes and the,
you know,

48
00:02:06,141 --> 00:02:06,974
the women going into it now,
but the environment was such that you 

49
00:02:08,871 --> 00:02:11,270
had to be really obsessive and I'm sure 
that,

50
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:12,823
you know,
many other female athletes at this time 

51
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,750
have that kind of obsessive streak.
But I think at that time,

52
00:02:17,751 --> 00:02:18,441
because we,
I mean,

53
00:02:18,441 --> 00:02:19,274
you know,
we'd scour the internet like mma 

54
00:02:20,241 --> 00:02:20,960
underground.
That was,

55
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:23,780
I was always looking for fights.
It was always trying to find somebody to

56
00:02:23,781 --> 00:02:25,220
find me or the shirt,
og forums,

57
00:02:25,221 --> 00:02:28,690
all that stuff before it got kind of,
yeah,

58
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:29,740
exactly.
I know.

59
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:30,250
It's like,
Oh,

60
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,083
who wants to fight?
And he wants to fight me and somebody 

61
00:02:31,761 --> 00:02:32,541
say,
I want to fight you.

62
00:02:32,541 --> 00:02:32,961
Like,
yes,

63
00:02:32,961 --> 00:02:33,740
thank you.
I'm so,

64
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:36,290
I'm so grateful.
It was a weird atmosphere back then.

65
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:37,260
Yeah,
it was a,

66
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:39,760
well,
it was people doing it just for the pure

67
00:02:39,761 --> 00:02:41,200
passion of it.
You know,

68
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,570
I got to talk to Jeremy Horn about this.
You know,

69
00:02:43,571 --> 00:02:48,130
Jeremy I think has had 150 pro fights,
something crazy like that.

70
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,353
And he was like,
you have to realize like back then we 

71
00:02:50,981 --> 00:02:52,930
were doing it because we wanted to do 
it.

72
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:53,973
It would no one was thinking that this 
was going to be an avenue for you to be 

73
00:02:56,441 --> 00:02:58,580
the next condom or greg or the next 
Ronda Rousey.

74
00:02:58,581 --> 00:02:59,414
I mean it didn't,

75
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:00,450
no,
no.

76
00:03:00,451 --> 00:03:01,020
My,
yeah,

77
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:02,600
my very first fight,
um,

78
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:03,773
they videotaped me was for Jeff Osborne 
and who can shoot and the video taping 

79
00:03:05,881 --> 00:03:07,200
this and what do you want to do at this?
And I was like,

80
00:03:07,201 --> 00:03:08,250
Oh,
I'm going to be in the UFC.

81
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:11,340
And that was 2004 there and you know,
everybody laughed at me.

82
00:03:11,341 --> 00:03:11,701
I was like,
no,

83
00:03:11,701 --> 00:03:13,110
I'm going to be in the UFC.
Just watch me.

84
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:15,960
I actually can't believe I did,
but I mean,

85
00:03:15,961 --> 00:03:17,220
I can't believe I,
that was my goal.

86
00:03:17,221 --> 00:03:17,641
That's what,
you know,

87
00:03:17,641 --> 00:03:19,050
that's,
I didn't do well on the UFC,

88
00:03:19,051 --> 00:03:21,360
but it got there you,
I check that one off.

89
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,250
But um,
you know,

90
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,113
it wasn't about being that superstar.
It was about where you would get to 

91
00:03:27,571 --> 00:03:28,440
fight,
you know,

92
00:03:28,441 --> 00:03:29,730
what would you,
you would get to do.

93
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:30,623
And I don't know,
just getting to fight with such a 

94
00:03:32,701 --> 00:03:33,960
pleasure,
you know,

95
00:03:33,961 --> 00:03:35,280
just the ABS.
I have a fight.

96
00:03:35,281 --> 00:03:36,960
The excitement you would have,
like I have a fight.

97
00:03:36,961 --> 00:03:37,950
Oh my God,
this is great.

98
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:39,013
That's a crazy feeling to try to explain
to someone that has never done anything 

99
00:03:44,511 --> 00:03:46,970
remotely as dangerous as competing in 
MMA.

100
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,120
You know?
Try to explain that to someone.

101
00:03:50,121 --> 00:03:50,954
Like if you were talking to some woman 
who's a doctor or a professor or a just 

102
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:58,040
normal job,
you know,

103
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:01,110
those aren't the most normal.
You don't tell him.

104
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:01,983
I'm just saying if you were trying to 
explain to someone what you want to 

105
00:04:05,181 --> 00:04:06,350
fight,
like you want,

106
00:04:06,351 --> 00:04:07,184
you're looking forward to something 
that's going to make you terribly 

107
00:04:09,171 --> 00:04:10,004
nervous,
you're probably going to want to throw 

108
00:04:11,181 --> 00:04:14,030
up right before you go out there.
You're going to be freaking out and then

109
00:04:14,031 --> 00:04:15,320
finally going to be in there doing it.

110
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:16,670
Yeah,
and it's,

111
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:18,380
yeah,
I mean it's really,

112
00:04:18,381 --> 00:04:19,760
it's difficult to,
to explain,

113
00:04:19,761 --> 00:04:20,594
I guess maybe ultra marathon runners or 
somebody of that kind of different 

114
00:04:23,571 --> 00:04:26,660
sphere of,
of expression would maybe understand it.

115
00:04:26,661 --> 00:04:28,580
What you want to run a hundred miles in 
the desert or whatever.

116
00:04:28,581 --> 00:04:29,870
You know,
I think that there's,

117
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:32,090
there's an extreme him and a lot of 
people that,

118
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:34,040
um,
lays pretty dormant,

119
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:35,323
but when you get into it,
when you find an avenue for it and you 

120
00:04:37,821 --> 00:04:38,654
get to explain,
it becomes so addictive and you just 

121
00:04:39,921 --> 00:04:40,970
want to keep doing it.
You want,

122
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,160
you can't stop doing it.

123
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:43,373
Do you also kind of take comfort in the 
fact that she's just a few of you out 

124
00:04:46,711 --> 00:04:49,110
there like that?
Because I've been really getting it,

125
00:04:49,111 --> 00:04:49,944
this is a really strange thing to get 
obsessed with because I'm not really 

126
00:04:52,231 --> 00:04:53,540
going to do it,
but I'm,

127
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:57,030
I'm obsessed with these people that hike
across the country.

128
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:59,460
Do you know what I'm talking to you 
about the Appalachian trail?

129
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:02,310
Yeah.
I'm having this guy on who has completed

130
00:05:02,311 --> 00:05:05,970
the Appalachian trail and I'm just,
I'm obsessed with these people.

131
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:08,730
They cut their toothbrushes in half to 
save weight.

132
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:12,780
Like they were one piece of clothing for
like six months.

133
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:15,000
Like it's nuts.
They bring water filters,

134
00:05:15,001 --> 00:05:17,880
they can find creeks and drink out of 
water and they,

135
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:18,743
these are educated people,
college degrees and they just want to 

136
00:05:21,121 --> 00:05:23,520
see if they can walk from Georgia to 
Maine.

137
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:24,900
I think

138
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,473
everybody has that in them to a certain 
extent where they just have to push 

139
00:05:29,181 --> 00:05:31,580
themselves in some direction.
Although,

140
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:32,960
you know,
when it comes to those long hikes,

141
00:05:32,961 --> 00:05:35,690
I've also heard from people who have 
failed at the Appalachian trail.

142
00:05:35,691 --> 00:05:36,524
You know,
after a certain point you're just 

143
00:05:37,191 --> 00:05:40,040
putting one foot in front of the other 
and it doesn't mean anything anymore.

144
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:41,940
Right.
So I think that there's also that,

145
00:05:41,941 --> 00:05:43,850
that sense of burnout,
but those people with that,

146
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,833
that drive to do something with passion,
I think is the perfect word for it that 

147
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:52,070
just want to push beyond what they know 
into a different sphere.

148
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:53,383
Um,
the problem is it does become addictive 

149
00:05:54,441 --> 00:05:56,930
and your body or your mind can't always 
keep up with it.

150
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:58,220
Yeah.
And there's a thing

151
00:05:58,220 --> 00:05:59,053
that happens to people when they become 
addicted to things where it overwhelms 

152
00:06:03,111 --> 00:06:04,760
them.
It becomes all consuming.

153
00:06:04,761 --> 00:06:05,511
Yeah.
You know,

154
00:06:05,511 --> 00:06:07,850
so you're all consuming.
Thing is trying to run.

155
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:10,280
You did a hundred miles,
now you got to run 200 miles like,

156
00:06:10,281 --> 00:06:10,860
yeah,
exactly.

157
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,170
Yeah.
You have to be faster this time.

158
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,220
Yeah.
Now you've got to win.

159
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,073
Like it's,
it's a strange compulsion to push 

160
00:06:18,271 --> 00:06:20,510
yourself to almost like experience 
yourself.

161
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:25,340
It's almost like regular life in its 
placid.

162
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:28,470
Vibration is frustrating.
It's just,

163
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,930
it's just,
there's not enough,

164
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:33,050
there's not enough tension.
There's not enough excitement.

165
00:06:33,051 --> 00:06:34,190
There's not enough you need like,

166
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,500
wow.
I mean that's,

167
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:37,720
that's how we settled a new world.
Right?

168
00:06:37,721 --> 00:06:40,570
That's how like that's,
I mean that's how mountains are,

169
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:41,920
are,
are climbed.

170
00:06:41,921 --> 00:06:42,754
Our summative,
that's how we get to space is because 

171
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,330
you just,
there's something in human nature that's

172
00:06:46,331 --> 00:06:49,210
so precious that you just have to keep 
pushing it.

173
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:50,680
It's a collective feeling.
But then,

174
00:06:50,681 --> 00:06:51,514
you know,
there's some individuals out there who 

175
00:06:52,061 --> 00:06:52,894
just stand a little bit apart or just an
a maybe a different playground and they 

176
00:06:56,321 --> 00:06:57,154
just want to keep pushing and pushing 
and pushing and they want to be the 

177
00:06:58,631 --> 00:07:00,700
ones.
And that's how we achieve.

178
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,680
The thing about mma though,
it's like you have to,

179
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:04,543
I guess,
balance that pushing with preserving 

180
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:08,293
your physical health,
especially someone who's as smart as 

181
00:07:09,951 --> 00:07:10,784
you,
it's gotta be an interesting sort of an 

182
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,490
act of balancing act because you're,
yeah.

183
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:16,880
I,
yeah,

184
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:18,350
excuse me for talking real.
Please.

185
00:07:18,351 --> 00:07:19,970
Go ahead.
I always get all excited and talk.

186
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,520
No,
I'm,

187
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,710
I,
my body's a rack now.

188
00:07:21,711 --> 00:07:22,544
Like I'm,
there's no way I could ever compete in 

189
00:07:23,811 --> 00:07:25,220
MMA again.
What's going on?

190
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:26,330
Oh,
my neck is out.

191
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,193
Um,
I had shoulder surgery in 2012 and 

192
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:31,520
something happened with my neck and it 
never healed correctly.

193
00:07:31,521 --> 00:07:33,230
So what is it?
No,

194
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:36,330
I've never getting Mris.
I hate it.

195
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:39,050
I don't like being in a tube like that.
It makes me really nervous.

196
00:07:39,051 --> 00:07:40,160
So you just,
yeah,

197
00:07:40,161 --> 00:07:41,270
so I just deal with it.
I mean,

198
00:07:41,271 --> 00:07:42,800
just massage and stuff.
But,

199
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:43,910
um,
uh,

200
00:07:43,911 --> 00:07:45,620
my knees are,
are pretty bad.

201
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,260
I get SCIATICA.
Like I understand that I don't,

202
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:49,363
I retired kind of young I guess,
but I understood that it was the time I 

203
00:07:52,401 --> 00:07:56,570
need it to because things were not going
to function in my body on the level that

204
00:07:56,571 --> 00:07:57,140
they needed to.

205
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:59,870
And my mind wasn't in a place where it 
would push beyond that.

206
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,580
When you competed professionally for 
what,

207
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:02,450
10 years more?
Yeah,

208
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:03,570
nine years.
I'm like,

209
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:04,610
yeah,
I mean I was,

210
00:08:04,611 --> 00:08:06,950
I've been doing martial arts since I was
four,

211
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:10,590
so that's a lot of years and there's a 
lot of years.

212
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:12,350
That's 32 years.
Um,

213
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:14,660
but you know,
I like actually competing.

214
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:19,220
Like I knew that that wasn't giving me,
I knew that at my last fight,

215
00:08:19,221 --> 00:08:21,230
like before I walked out there,
I told Greg Jackson,

216
00:08:21,231 --> 00:08:21,711
I said,
this is it.

217
00:08:21,711 --> 00:08:23,000
I'm done.
And he was like,

218
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:24,380
okay.
Which,

219
00:08:24,381 --> 00:08:25,214
and I was like,
is he going to try it before you went 

220
00:08:25,941 --> 00:08:26,541
out there?
Oh,

221
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:28,010
I was so sick.
I got,

222
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:28,990
yeah,
I had food poisoning.

223
00:08:28,991 --> 00:08:30,650
It was weird.
It was when I fought batchko hair.

224
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:31,993
And,
um,

225
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:33,400
um,
anyway,

226
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:34,243
you know,
stressing about batch rolling your yell 

227
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,193
a little bit,
a little bit.

228
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:38,303
Know there's always that you always had 
that thing where it's like I won that 

229
00:08:39,771 --> 00:08:40,640
fight.
Come on,

230
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:41,330
right?
Yeah.

231
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:42,163
Throw me a bone.
I won that fight and stop wiggling your 

232
00:08:43,191 --> 00:08:44,060
butt.
But you know,

233
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,640
whatever.
She does her thing.

234
00:08:46,641 --> 00:08:49,400
She's been very successful with the 
batch brand.

235
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:51,550
Um,
but uh,

236
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:52,940
no,
I had food poisoning.

237
00:08:52,941 --> 00:08:53,691
I don't know.
Back then,

238
00:08:53,691 --> 00:08:54,410
you know,
you were still,

239
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:55,243
you're still like to do ivs and stuff.
So I had ivs and I thought they worked 

240
00:08:57,451 --> 00:08:59,460
well and I think I ate something wrong 
or something weird,

241
00:08:59,461 --> 00:09:02,280
but I woke up the next day.
Well I have a history of a lot of,

242
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:04,500
of shitting myself a lot.
I don't know.

243
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,390
Well yes,
that has happened.

244
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,253
Yes.
It's what I'm known for is shitting 

245
00:09:08,401 --> 00:09:10,310
myself in Russia.
But um,

246
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:11,413
yeah,
it was a good one right in front of 

247
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,390
Putin.
I'm really,

248
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:14,730
you show yourself in front of Putin.

249
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,840
Well,
okay,

250
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:18,350
I'll,
I'll backtrack to that story cause it's,

251
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:22,020
it's my favorite.
It's my mma story story.

252
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:23,160
Yeah,
no,

253
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,540
it was my first fight under Greg 
Jackson.

254
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:26,790
It was in 2007 was after the Toronto 
fight.

255
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:27,690
And I,
um,

256
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:30,510
I had met him at that fight.
He enjoyed these in your,

257
00:09:30,511 --> 00:09:31,344
and Keith Jardine,
some of these people and they were 

258
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:32,874
really kind to me and I had another 
fight in Saint Petersburg with bodog a 

259
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,820
couple months later and my corner man 
couldn't make it.

260
00:09:38,821 --> 00:09:42,780
I was in Indiana at the time.
Was that the undercard of Fader and Matt

261
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:43,560
Lindland?
Yes,

262
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,393
yes.
Yeah.

263
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:46,320
Um,
so I,

264
00:09:46,321 --> 00:09:48,330
uh,
I called up this nice guy.

265
00:09:48,331 --> 00:09:51,090
I didn't know he was famous.
All I cared about was women competing in

266
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:52,590
the sport.
I didn't care about the guys very much.

267
00:09:52,591 --> 00:09:53,730
You know,
I liked tough,

268
00:09:53,731 --> 00:09:55,830
was interesting,
but it really didn't do anything for me.

269
00:09:55,831 --> 00:09:57,630
I would watch fights if I could,
but I couldn't afford paper.

270
00:09:58,920 --> 00:09:59,341
It was like,
well,

271
00:09:59,341 --> 00:10:02,250
they're not letting me in that show,
but bodog did you know these other shows

272
00:10:02,251 --> 00:10:03,084
that were,
you know,

273
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:06,330
Internet based,
and I call up this nice guy,

274
00:10:06,331 --> 00:10:07,500
Greg Jackson,
and I'm just like,

275
00:10:07,501 --> 00:10:08,800
Hey,
uh,

276
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:10,860
would you be interested in coronary me 
for a fight?

277
00:10:10,861 --> 00:10:11,341
And he's like,
well,

278
00:10:11,341 --> 00:10:12,780
why don't you come here and train?
And I was like,

279
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:14,490
Oh,
I'm one of those.

280
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,313
And it turned out no,
he uses really nice guy who gave me a 

281
00:10:17,551 --> 00:10:19,110
job and a place to live when I moved 
there.

282
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:20,220
But,
um,

283
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:21,083
no,
but,

284
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:22,330
um,
so I,

285
00:10:22,331 --> 00:10:23,164
I drove out to albuquerque and I was 
there for three days and I realized I 

286
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,280
was never going to leave.
Like,

287
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:27,270
this is it,
this is my team,

288
00:10:27,271 --> 00:10:29,070
this is my home,
like left everything behind me,

289
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:32,010
which wasn't maybe very nice to my 
boyfriend,

290
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,130
but you know,
boyfriends.

291
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,480
Yeah.
I mean it was my fight career.

292
00:10:36,481 --> 00:10:40,170
Like that's what counted Indiana.
Yeah.

293
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:43,720
Just outside of Indianapolis.
And Albuquerque is a,

294
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:46,443
it's not like you're moving to some like
boulder or even looking at the rocky 

295
00:10:50,131 --> 00:10:51,380
mountains or something.
I mean,

296
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:52,440
there are beautiful mountains,
but no,

297
00:10:52,441 --> 00:10:53,240
it's not.
It's not,

298
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,300
uh,
maybe,

299
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:55,531
uh,
pleasure,

300
00:10:55,531 --> 00:10:58,830
destination Turkey,
the Jackson camp there.

301
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:00,390
It's a little odd.
It's an odd,

302
00:11:00,391 --> 00:11:03,420
it would have been a difficult move 
without the Jackson Campaign for sure.

303
00:11:03,421 --> 00:11:03,961
Yeah.
You know,

304
00:11:03,961 --> 00:11:04,794
the crack needles everywhere.
He's done a great job of fostering like 

305
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,440
this amazing sense of community though.
Yeah.

306
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:10,303
Yeah.
He really,

307
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:12,330
yeah,
there they are.

308
00:11:12,331 --> 00:11:13,770
Tremendous men.
Like I,

309
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:17,070
I feel like I did a lot of great stuff 
in my life.

310
00:11:17,071 --> 00:11:17,904
Like I'm proud of the things I've done,
but I think that I was also surrounded 

311
00:11:19,741 --> 00:11:22,650
by people who really guided me well,
who really like,

312
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:25,470
you know,
like going back to school and stuff like

313
00:11:25,471 --> 00:11:26,430
that after my career,
you know,

314
00:11:26,431 --> 00:11:27,264
these are,
this is the influences of people who 

315
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:29,124
were just like,
they care about the people on their 

316
00:11:30,601 --> 00:11:30,990
team.

317
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:32,520
They care about who they surround 
themselves with.

318
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:34,980
But I didn't know any of that.
I just kind of showed up.

319
00:11:34,981 --> 00:11:35,850
And first,
you know,

320
00:11:35,851 --> 00:11:37,380
I drive to the gym and Greg says,
Oh,

321
00:11:37,381 --> 00:11:40,260
follow me back to my place.
And immediately I back into the dumpster

322
00:11:40,261 --> 00:11:43,620
at the gym.
I'm a total Klutz.

323
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,360
Um,
but no,

324
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:46,223
he came out to Russia with me for that 
fight and I want to impress him because 

325
00:11:49,771 --> 00:11:51,210
I didn't realize until it was in that 
gym,

326
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:51,720
I was just like,
oh,

327
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,590
this is going to be like my sense I like
this is the,

328
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:54,070
this

329
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:54,903
is like,
I feel like a Samurai and this is like 

330
00:11:56,471 --> 00:11:57,304
the person I want to,
I forgot what that relationship is 

331
00:11:59,681 --> 00:12:01,630
called.
This is the person I really want to lead

332
00:12:01,631 --> 00:12:02,464
me and guide me.
He's my leader and I wanted to impress 

333
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:06,910
him so badly.
And that fight,

334
00:12:06,911 --> 00:12:07,744
first thing she does right away,
it was against Yulia bears a coveage 

335
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:11,680
first thing she does punch me in the 
nose,

336
00:12:11,681 --> 00:12:13,210
just shatters my nose,
blood everywhere.

337
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:14,021
I was like,
great,

338
00:12:14,021 --> 00:12:14,854
this is again.
And it was right after the Toronto 

339
00:12:15,881 --> 00:12:16,714
fight.
So it was like I was used to losing 

340
00:12:17,321 --> 00:12:18,154
which,
and you never want to get in that space 

341
00:12:18,731 --> 00:12:21,970
of being used to losing.
But somehow I clicked and you know,

342
00:12:21,971 --> 00:12:22,804
I,
I did pretty well in the fight and I 

343
00:12:23,621 --> 00:12:26,770
ended up getting a mounted triangle on 
her and finishing with strikes.

344
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:29,320
Um,
in between rounds,

345
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,393
another corner,
men put cold water in the back of my 

346
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:34,720
neck.
And I thought that I just started,

347
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:36,530
I thought it was a Fart,
but

348
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:40,290
turns out,
and this poor girl mounted triangle,

349
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,500
no less,
this poor girl,

350
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:45,600
I had no idea of this.
Oh yeah.

351
00:12:45,601 --> 00:12:47,040
So they grab us,
they put us on his bus,

352
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:47,560
I'm still in my

353
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,400
fight,
closes of blood,

354
00:12:48,401 --> 00:12:49,234
can limit gloves on and they just put us
on a bus separate me and Amanda Buckner 

355
00:12:51,731 --> 00:12:52,564
from our corner men and everything 
because we'd want our fights and they 

356
00:12:55,181 --> 00:12:59,260
take us to this palace and I cannot 
remember who's pals,

357
00:12:59,261 --> 00:13:00,094
Alexander or something like it was in 
Saint Petersburg and it was beautiful 

358
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:03,120
gold.
Damn.

359
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:07,270
I was going to silk and just,
I'm in my clothes and I'm like,

360
00:13:07,271 --> 00:13:09,250
what is that smell?
And I was like,

361
00:13:09,251 --> 00:13:11,610
I'd seen a guy puking backstage cause 
you know,

362
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:12,640
cause of a headshot.
And I was like,

363
00:13:12,641 --> 00:13:15,970
I must've like rolled in it or stepped 
in and I smell so bad.

364
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:19,000
And John Claude van Damme randomly walks
up to us.

365
00:13:19,001 --> 00:13:20,050
I mean it was just like,
you know,

366
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:21,520
bay doors here,
John Claude van Damme,

367
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:24,430
this and that.
Like just weird and surreal already head

368
00:13:24,431 --> 00:13:27,250
trauma going on with me.
Like not really in my right mind.

369
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:29,800
Right.
And I just,

370
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:33,280
it was so weird to be like smelling 
myself and being like,

371
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:34,330
God,
I stepped in Puke.

372
00:13:34,331 --> 00:13:37,270
I'm sorry Mister Van dam like that.
I smell so badly.

373
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,153
That's so crazy too because you got 
punched in the nose if you smelled it 

374
00:13:40,501 --> 00:13:42,800
through,
your nose is fucked up.

375
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:44,873
I remember being on the bus and looking 
around going to say Miami perfume or 

376
00:13:47,431 --> 00:13:49,050
anything and other people are allowed to
shower,

377
00:13:49,051 --> 00:13:50,580
but I was allowed to swing bat.
Right.

378
00:13:50,581 --> 00:13:51,414
So I was right after

379
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,473
put you on a bus,
didn't tell me where I was going and 

380
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:57,950
that's a good way to get staff.
No kidding.

381
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:00,170
It was really gross.
I've been lucky with staff,

382
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:02,370
but yes.
So we,

383
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:03,373
I ended up,
you know,

384
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:05,690
going to the restroom,
looking at the shit kicked all over it.

385
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:09,160
Oh,
it was like,

386
00:14:09,161 --> 00:14:11,440
it must have been in between rounds.
It's disgusting.

387
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:12,543
It's like there's no trashcan.
It's like silk and gold in this 

388
00:14:14,501 --> 00:14:15,334
beautiful palace

389
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,193
stuff.
So I just like take my panties off and 

390
00:14:17,071 --> 00:14:19,200
just like roll them up and shove him 
behind the toilet.

391
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:24,630
Black Lace Thong Vladimir Putin.
That was mine.

392
00:14:24,631 --> 00:14:25,890
I want to,
I want it back.

393
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:27,030
No,
I don't want it back.

394
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:30,620
2000.
It was 10 years ago and that's crap.

395
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:31,450
Wow.
Yeah.

396
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:32,283
So,
and then I just go back out there and 

397
00:14:33,021 --> 00:14:35,090
it's like Berlusconi was like hitting on
me and,

398
00:14:35,091 --> 00:14:35,924
and,
and like trying to pick me up and he's 

399
00:14:36,711 --> 00:14:37,011
like,
Hey,

400
00:14:37,011 --> 00:14:38,480
can I be your boyfriend tonight?
And I'm just like,

401
00:14:38,481 --> 00:14:39,270
what?

402
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:41,090
Sing it through a translator.
So it was so,

403
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,810
and I'm like,
I smell like shit.

404
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:44,550
Like I couldn't,
it was like,

405
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:49,350
you are a dirty motherfucker.
Like Putin comes,

406
00:14:49,351 --> 00:14:50,430
you know,
puts his arm around me,

407
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:51,264
Dan.
I'm just like

408
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:53,980
weird as hell.
That wasn't,

409
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:54,843
it was just like I shit myself in front 
of foreign dignitaries in another 

410
00:14:57,210 --> 00:14:58,270
country.
Wow.

411
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:02,700
That's probably my favorite MMA story.
How surreal was it to meet booton?

412
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:05,460
I had no idea at the time,
like what a big deal,

413
00:15:05,461 --> 00:15:07,950
but that's usually,
I stumbled into things without knowing,

414
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:11,130
which is probably best because I'm a 
very nervous person.

415
00:15:11,131 --> 00:15:11,964
Like I'm a very intense person and so 
being there and just having had the 

416
00:15:15,091 --> 00:15:16,380
fight,
I dunno.

417
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:18,870
Like when I think about it,
I'm just like,

418
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:21,900
I'm sorry Donald Trump,
but your hookers pissing on you thing.

419
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:27,240
Sorry Dude.
Then done and it's been done better.

420
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:28,083
Yeah.

421
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:31,930
Evil.
Wow then.

422
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:33,910
And I had no idea.
No idea.

423
00:15:33,911 --> 00:15:35,280
No idea.
No idea.

424
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,850
What he looked different then.
Yeah.

425
00:15:36,851 --> 00:15:38,110
I was really blonde.
No,

426
00:15:38,111 --> 00:15:39,520
he,
he did look different,

427
00:15:39,521 --> 00:15:40,380
didn't he?
Yeah.

428
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:41,740
Yeah.
Wow.

429
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:44,740
That was when he had taken a break from 
being the dictator,

430
00:15:44,741 --> 00:15:45,281
right?
Yeah.

431
00:15:45,281 --> 00:15:47,650
I think he was prime minister at that 
time or something,

432
00:15:47,651 --> 00:15:49,510
but then he just went right back into 
power.

433
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:50,740
Oh Wow.
Yeah.

434
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:52,110
It was crazy.
So strange.

435
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:53,013
Oh,
just being in that kind of atmosphere 

436
00:15:54,281 --> 00:15:55,114
and sweatpants and fight close.
I'm just not going to tap out was still 

437
00:15:57,401 --> 00:15:58,234
cool.
Oh yeah.

438
00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:00,700
I love them.
They were like,

439
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:03,730
they put me on their show.
Like they took such good care of me.

440
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,440
Ah,
yeah.

441
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:09,000
I mean it's a good,
the tap out stories,

442
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:09,843
like a good cautionary tale for like 
beating a brand in the ground to the 

443
00:16:14,431 --> 00:16:17,140
point where you gotta like go up to some
people and go,

444
00:16:17,141 --> 00:16:18,160
hey man,
you can't wear shit.

445
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:21,700
Oh,
I know plenty though.

446
00:16:21,701 --> 00:16:22,160
It's so

447
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,330
weird.
Yeah.

448
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,160
It's a weird thing like branding and all
of that.

449
00:16:25,161 --> 00:16:25,994
That's a huge,
like now I'm becoming so aware of it 

450
00:16:28,431 --> 00:16:29,264
because I know other writers,
that's a really big avenue because if 

451
00:16:30,771 --> 00:16:31,604
you think about Donald Trump,
I mean he's become president because of 

452
00:16:34,011 --> 00:16:34,880
his brand.
Right?

453
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:36,200
There's a lot of ways.
Yeah.

454
00:16:36,201 --> 00:16:38,360
I'm stealing one of the other writers 
ideas right now,

455
00:16:38,361 --> 00:16:39,980
so I shouldn't be saying that,
but yeah.

456
00:16:39,981 --> 00:16:40,814
But I mean really,
he's a brand and that brand was so 

457
00:16:42,801 --> 00:16:43,634
successful.
It convinced a bunch of people that 

458
00:16:45,831 --> 00:16:47,420
that's what was going to be best for our
country.

459
00:16:47,421 --> 00:16:48,890
And it was a brand.
It was a commercial.

460
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:50,743
There's that,
but I think there's also a real lack of 

461
00:16:52,581 --> 00:16:53,414
substantial options.
It wasn't like there was any one 

462
00:16:55,131 --> 00:16:57,110
compelling person that was next to him.

463
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:58,013
I know I was such a Bernie Fan.
I really thought that he was outside of 

464
00:17:01,351 --> 00:17:02,570
the mold.
Um,

465
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:05,760
but everybody is a politician.
I mean it's,

466
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:06,773
he's a boy.
He's the best example I think of a guy 

467
00:17:08,641 --> 00:17:11,490
who really isn't beholden to any special
interest groups.

468
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:12,773
But I think what he offered and what 
trump offers as well is that they're 

469
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:20,820
outside of the system in some way.
Trump appears to be like way more inside

470
00:17:20,821 --> 00:17:21,654
the system news giving on to be,
but at least it's shakes up this 

471
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:27,053
ridiculous.
They have this like really cryptic sort 

472
00:17:30,601 --> 00:17:35,601
of way of doing business and bizarre way
of intermingling money and influence and

473
00:17:37,921 --> 00:17:38,754
politics and putting it all together and
it's just something has got to come 

474
00:17:42,601 --> 00:17:43,920
along to let people know like,
Hey,

475
00:17:43,921 --> 00:17:46,620
this system sucks.
It doesn't represent us.

476
00:17:46,621 --> 00:17:48,060
It's foolish.
It's ancient.

477
00:17:48,061 --> 00:17:50,100
It was made up when people used to write
with

478
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,700
feathers.
We really need a better system.

479
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:55,240
I agree.
I totally agree.

480
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:57,370
And you know,
like this entire election,

481
00:17:57,371 --> 00:17:59,230
everything about it has pushed me into 
being like,

482
00:17:59,231 --> 00:18:00,064
no man,
I'm a straight up socialist like an I 

483
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:03,400
used to resist that title.
Or you say no,

484
00:18:03,401 --> 00:18:04,960
I'm liberal and I'm this and that.
No,

485
00:18:04,961 --> 00:18:05,651
no,
no,

486
00:18:05,651 --> 00:18:07,900
I'm a socialist.
I don't actually even think that I agree

487
00:18:07,901 --> 00:18:10,660
with some of the liberal things that 
have been espoused during all of this.

488
00:18:10,661 --> 00:18:14,770
Like I think that we are at a point and 
evolved people,

489
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:16,571
you know,
in,

490
00:18:16,571 --> 00:18:17,404
in such a respect that we have to take 
care of each other and it has to be 

491
00:18:20,501 --> 00:18:21,334
mandated from a bigger power because we 
don't take care of each other otherwise 

492
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:26,020
no socialist.
Like in what way?

493
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,270
How do you define it?
You don't,

494
00:18:28,271 --> 00:18:30,760
my idea of socialism,
of course we'd never fly,

495
00:18:30,761 --> 00:18:31,594
but it's basically a bit,
we all pay into a system that pays us 

496
00:18:33,911 --> 00:18:35,080
back.
We all,

497
00:18:35,081 --> 00:18:35,914
you know,
we all work for the common man and I 

498
00:18:36,821 --> 00:18:39,580
know that that's not it.
It never works.

499
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:42,310
But in my mind that's the way it should 
be,

500
00:18:42,311 --> 00:18:44,110
that we should all be working for the 
guy next to us.

501
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:45,730
What would work great if people like 
you,

502
00:18:45,731 --> 00:18:47,410
if they're hardworking,
smart people.

503
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:48,960
Well,
I mean I have student loans out now.

504
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:52,970
Well that's another discussion.
Totally.

505
00:18:52,971 --> 00:18:54,920
But I think student loans are 
disgusting.

506
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:55,783
I think what they're doing by 
subsidizing education and making people 

507
00:18:58,041 --> 00:18:59,660
pay these ridiculous rates,
not only that,

508
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:02,090
if you go bankrupt,
it doesn't matter.

509
00:19:02,091 --> 00:19:03,920
You still have to pay your student 
loans.

510
00:19:03,921 --> 00:19:07,700
You can never get away from that.
A single other business venture that you

511
00:19:07,701 --> 00:19:11,240
get into and you would consider 
investing in your education and possibly

512
00:19:11,241 --> 00:19:13,070
a future as some sort of a business 
venture,

513
00:19:13,071 --> 00:19:18,071
business slash educational adventure.
You're not you all that money period.

514
00:19:18,381 --> 00:19:19,770
You're not getting away from it.
You,

515
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:21,380
they'll drag you to the ground.

516
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:22,310
They will.
You know,

517
00:19:22,311 --> 00:19:23,144
and I would say that the thing that it 
does have going for is the interest 

518
00:19:25,191 --> 00:19:26,024
rates a little bit better than like 
credit cards and cars and stuff should 

519
00:19:28,191 --> 00:19:30,860
be zero interest rate should be,
I mean education should be,

520
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:32,563
in my opinion,
it should be for every like people 

521
00:19:33,561 --> 00:19:35,600
should be educated.
It should be.

522
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:36,750
And I'm with you.
Yeah,

523
00:19:36,751 --> 00:19:39,750
I think it should be free.
I 100 and I think it should be available

524
00:19:39,751 --> 00:19:40,584
to anyone at anytime in your life.
I don't think you should be like 43 

525
00:19:43,531 --> 00:19:45,630
years old and you can't go back to 
school again.

526
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:46,493
I mean,
I don't think it should be able to go 

527
00:19:46,621 --> 00:19:47,454
back to school at anytime.
It shouldn't just be for 18 year old 

528
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:49,854
people right out of high school.
It should be for anybody that really 

529
00:19:51,991 --> 00:19:53,390
wants to learn and educate.
Yeah.

530
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:54,373
Yeah.
I actually think 18 year old people 

531
00:19:55,901 --> 00:19:58,180
right out of high school should be 
taking some time off to actually see the

532
00:19:58,181 --> 00:19:59,014
world before they go back into this 
because if you don't choose to approach 

533
00:20:01,661 --> 00:20:05,800
your education seriously,
you're going to have a really hard time.

534
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:08,260
I'm not a big fan of rigid systems 
either.

535
00:20:08,261 --> 00:20:10,570
I'm not a fan of like this really 
regimented,

536
00:20:10,571 --> 00:20:13,840
go through four years of high school,
go through four years of college,

537
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:15,520
then you do this,
then you get a job.

538
00:20:15,521 --> 00:20:17,500
It's dirt,
you're 30 you should have a child.

539
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:20,740
I just don't buy any of it.
I just think it's,

540
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:21,873
there's so many different people out 
there with so many different dreams and 

541
00:20:24,011 --> 00:20:26,970
aspirations and interests.
We were,

542
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:28,023
it's so rigid.
And when kids see this rigid path in 

543
00:20:30,341 --> 00:20:31,330
front of them,
first of all,

544
00:20:31,331 --> 00:20:34,120
it gives them anxiety.
That's what it used to give me as to see

545
00:20:34,121 --> 00:20:36,310
people that were going to college and 
getting degrees,

546
00:20:36,311 --> 00:20:38,110
getting jobs.
I'd get anxious because it was like,

547
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:40,870
I'm not like them.
I feel like a loser.

548
00:20:40,871 --> 00:20:42,580
I feel like an outcast,
you know?

549
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:47,730
And I think that if we made education 
free and made it available to people,

550
00:20:47,951 --> 00:20:48,784
like I just don't think,
I think that if we could spend the 

551
00:20:50,381 --> 00:20:51,940
amount of money that we spend on the 
military,

552
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:54,190
not that we should cut back the amount 
of money,

553
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:55,203
but there's gotta be that same amount of
money or in the neighborhood of that 

554
00:20:58,091 --> 00:20:58,924
same amount of money that could go 
towards infrastructure that could go 

555
00:21:01,331 --> 00:21:02,164
towards education,
that could go towards impoverished 

556
00:21:03,911 --> 00:21:04,570
communities.

557
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:07,840
There's like zero effort made to build 
this country back up.

558
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:09,080
Well,
I would say yeah,

559
00:21:09,081 --> 00:21:12,020
and looking at the proposals on deck 
right now,

560
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:15,680
the little that's being used for it,
like the any and stuff like that,

561
00:21:15,681 --> 00:21:17,960
that's being taken off now.
I mean the what?

562
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:19,880
The National Endowment for the arts,
stuff like that.

563
00:21:19,881 --> 00:21:23,330
That gives actual like people and 
artists who maybe don't fit the mold but

564
00:21:23,331 --> 00:21:26,600
actually have a,
a venture going for them that they could

565
00:21:26,601 --> 00:21:29,720
be successful with if they got some sort
of funding or support.

566
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:32,610
I agree with that,
but I've been to the La County Museum of

567
00:21:32,611 --> 00:21:34,110
art,
that Lacma thing.

568
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:35,250
Jesus Christ,
I'll take you there.

569
00:21:35,251 --> 00:21:36,300
If you want,
you'll fucking,

570
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,193
you want to throw punches at people that
they have the most ridiculous like 

571
00:21:40,471 --> 00:21:41,304
modern art.
Like this is a video of people playing 

572
00:21:42,931 --> 00:21:44,790
catch.
This is art and I'm not kidding.

573
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:45,750
Well,
you know,

574
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:46,740
it's all subsidized

575
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,153
very hard time.
I actually love modern art if I know 

576
00:21:50,861 --> 00:21:52,360
what's going on.
But if I don't,

577
00:21:52,361 --> 00:21:53,194
then I feel like I'm,
I'm just not getting it and I don't 

578
00:21:55,481 --> 00:21:56,590
understand what's happening.
But I,

579
00:21:56,591 --> 00:21:57,940
yeah,
I do think that,

580
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:01,690
I think not pushing art on people,
I shouldn't say pushing our,

581
00:22:01,691 --> 00:22:02,524
but I,
I guess providing opportunities for art 

582
00:22:03,581 --> 00:22:06,190
for people and not just art isn't 
painting or sculpture,

583
00:22:06,191 --> 00:22:07,024
but I mean like writing and literature 
and it's the ways I do think that the 

584
00:22:11,291 --> 00:22:12,940
rigid educational system or you just 
like,

585
00:22:12,941 --> 00:22:13,751
you do this,
you do this,

586
00:22:13,751 --> 00:22:14,584
you do this.
Some people's brains just aren't wired 

587
00:22:15,581 --> 00:22:16,330
that way.
Right.

588
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:20,560
But there are other avenues for them to 
be creative and define themselves.

589
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:21,423
And like I found with mma,
I mean I was prelaw and then my last 

590
00:22:24,131 --> 00:22:25,800
semester of college I was like,
I don't want to,

591
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:27,550
I don't want to go to law school.
I don't want to do this.

592
00:22:27,551 --> 00:22:29,490
I want to be professional fighter.
Now

593
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,320
what would compel you to do that?
Because you,

594
00:22:31,321 --> 00:22:33,270
you have this long history of martial 
arts,

595
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:35,310
you got into martial arts,
you said when you're four,

596
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:36,300
five,
four,

597
00:22:36,301 --> 00:22:37,134
four taekwondo.
Yeah.

598
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:40,770
And so you had,
when did you first compete?

599
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,120
Did you compete in taekwondo tournament?
Right.

600
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:42,901
Did I did,
um,

601
00:22:42,901 --> 00:22:46,980
when I was a teenager I did a lot of the
like the Nazca circuit and the um,

602
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:48,730
international sport car,
whatever those,

603
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:50,200
so point karate.
Yeah,

604
00:22:50,201 --> 00:22:51,034
I did a lot of point karate.
You can tell from my fighting cause it 

605
00:22:52,361 --> 00:22:55,250
was always stick at my chin out.
Um,

606
00:22:55,330 --> 00:22:56,141
but yeah,
no,

607
00:22:56,141 --> 00:22:56,974
I,
I did a lot of sport karate and I was 

608
00:22:58,090 --> 00:22:59,920
very anxious to be competitive.
Um,

609
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:02,020
one of my friends,
I went back to the,

610
00:23:02,021 --> 00:23:02,854
to the final hook and shoot a couple 
weeks ago and one of my friends Darrell 

611
00:23:04,451 --> 00:23:06,070
nearer used to train with me.
And he,

612
00:23:06,071 --> 00:23:06,904
he was,
um,

613
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:07,893
he said,
don't you remember when you were 15 or 

614
00:23:08,561 --> 00:23:09,394
you're running around the gym just 
asking people to punch you in the face 

615
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:13,360
because they,
you weren't allowed to punch in the face

616
00:23:13,361 --> 00:23:14,194
in some of these tournaments and you 
wanted to know if you could keep 

617
00:23:15,311 --> 00:23:16,144
fighting.
Like I wanted to know if I could keep 

618
00:23:17,201 --> 00:23:18,400
fighting.
If I got punched in the face,

619
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:19,493
I was going quit bold to hit you and 
training so that you could see if you 

620
00:23:21,601 --> 00:23:22,270
can keep going.

621
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:23,103
Yeah.
And then I had my nose severely broken 

622
00:23:24,671 --> 00:23:26,340
where I had to have surgery on it.
Um,

623
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:27,783
and after that,
that's when I decided to be a 

624
00:23:28,691 --> 00:23:30,250
professional fighter.
After the surgery,

625
00:23:30,251 --> 00:23:32,920
I should have probably waited.
But how'd you get your nose broken?

626
00:23:32,921 --> 00:23:33,790
Initially?
Spin.

627
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:34,391
Spin.
Hook,

628
00:23:34,391 --> 00:23:35,151
kick.
Oh Geez.

629
00:23:35,151 --> 00:23:36,100
Yeah,
it was like over here.

630
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:37,540
Yeah.
That's a bad one.

631
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:38,321
Yeah.
But I mean,

632
00:23:38,321 --> 00:23:39,154
now it's like,
it's been broken like seven or eight 

633
00:23:39,941 --> 00:23:41,650
times now.
Like I'd love to get it fixed again,

634
00:23:41,651 --> 00:23:44,830
but I'm not sure that my student health 
insurance covers that.

635
00:23:44,831 --> 00:23:45,080
So

636
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:47,190
does your septum work or is it,
yeah,

637
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:49,423
I can't breathe out of the left side.
What I found out though was really 

638
00:23:50,931 --> 00:23:55,060
disturbing was that your ears like how 
they calcify and become cauliflower ear.

639
00:23:55,090 --> 00:23:56,630
Your nose does that too.
Oh,

640
00:23:56,631 --> 00:23:57,560
I can believe that.
Yeah.

641
00:23:57,561 --> 00:23:58,394
So the inside of your nose can develop 
all these hard calcified areas where 

642
00:24:02,121 --> 00:24:04,220
blood is sort of pulled in.
Oh Wow.

643
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:07,520
Yeah.
I had to get mine scraped out and they,

644
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:09,890
they cut out,
I think they're called the turbinates,

645
00:24:09,891 --> 00:24:10,724
these,
these big lumps in there and they kind 

646
00:24:11,921 --> 00:24:12,754
of cut them down to open up the path and
then they shoved splints in there and 

647
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:18,250
separate it.
Like it mixed,

648
00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:19,683
it makes the whole wider.
Making the whole wider is not always a 

649
00:24:23,121 --> 00:24:25,090
good thing.
But I would say for a nose it's,

650
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:27,590
yes,
yes and yes.

651
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:29,810
Sorry,
I'm kind of pervy.

652
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:31,520
Um,
yeah,

653
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:32,620
no,
that's um,

654
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:34,010
I,
I would love to have my nose fixed,

655
00:24:34,011 --> 00:24:34,844
but it is kind of helps you breathe.
Like it helps you sleep if your nose is 

656
00:24:38,331 --> 00:24:39,440
a big thing.
I,

657
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:41,600
mine was fucked up till I was 39 I 
think,

658
00:24:41,601 --> 00:24:43,970
or 40 and then I finally got it fixed 
and I was like,

659
00:24:43,971 --> 00:24:44,804
I can't believe I lived like this my 
whole life with a fucked up stuffed up 

660
00:24:47,751 --> 00:24:49,950
nose all the time.
More clearly.

661
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,670
My cardio is better,
everything's better.

662
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:55,670
When I didn't,
I just was a mouth breather.

663
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,620
Like literally a mouth breather.
Yeah.

664
00:24:57,650 --> 00:24:59,010
There's a lot of fighters that are like 
that.

665
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:00,260
You talk to them,
he kind of,

666
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,990
you hear that in their voice,
how they have that thing going on with a

667
00:25:02,991 --> 00:25:04,430
nasal when you know like,
Oh,

668
00:25:04,431 --> 00:25:05,264
you're all clogged up man.
Like I always wonder what the 

669
00:25:08,271 --> 00:25:12,260
relationship between fighters and like 
sinus medication is a lot.

670
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:13,160
Yeah.
I was gonna say like,

671
00:25:13,161 --> 00:25:15,650
I,
I still take it all the time just to,

672
00:25:15,651 --> 00:25:17,750
you know,
just to be able to function.

673
00:25:17,751 --> 00:25:21,380
Otherwise Shit's addictive.
Very addictive.

674
00:25:21,381 --> 00:25:23,770
Like what does it Afrins yeah,
yeah,

675
00:25:24,210 --> 00:25:26,480
yeah.
You're making me think right now.

676
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:28,790
Yeah.
It's a weird thing.

677
00:25:28,791 --> 00:25:29,624
That stuff,
it makes your nostrils dilate and it 

678
00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:33,483
opens them up,
but when you stop taking it all clamps 

679
00:25:35,061 --> 00:25:37,300
down feels like even tighter.
Right.

680
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:39,720
Yeah.
Not Good.

681
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:42,430
Yeah.
A lot of good therapy for it.

682
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:43,873
Yeah.
A lot of guys stuff that stuff up their 

683
00:25:44,781 --> 00:25:46,070
nose.
Yeah.

684
00:25:46,071 --> 00:25:48,620
Though the body is just not meant to 
take the kind of abuse.

685
00:25:48,621 --> 00:25:49,820
You were good.
You were detailing.

686
00:25:49,821 --> 00:25:52,160
Your neck is fucked up,
your knees are fucked up.

687
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:53,940
My shoulder is still pretty weak.
The,

688
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:58,580
that fixed my labor on it happened in 
the tate fight.

689
00:25:58,581 --> 00:25:59,414
I think it was tearing before that fight
because I always had a lot of shoulder 

690
00:26:01,191 --> 00:26:01,760
pain.

691
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,860
But I've had shoulder pain on both sides
a lot.

692
00:26:03,861 --> 00:26:05,480
But um,
during the tate fight,

693
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:06,373
I remember throwing a left hook or 
something and just below what the hell 

694
00:26:08,781 --> 00:26:10,820
happened.
My labor was torn all the way through,

695
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:14,840
but I had this weird genetic thing 
called a Buford complex,

696
00:26:14,841 --> 00:26:16,850
which that's an hilarious name for 
something,

697
00:26:16,851 --> 00:26:17,684
but it's like a thick intendance.
So it was holding my arm up so I didn't 

698
00:26:20,181 --> 00:26:22,040
know that it was actually torn all the 
way through.

699
00:26:22,041 --> 00:26:22,874
It wasn't like limp,
but I do remember like not all of a 

700
00:26:24,831 --> 00:26:26,900
sudden not being able to base on my left
side and be like,

701
00:26:26,901 --> 00:26:28,100
Whoa,
what's going on here?

702
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:32,360
But during the fight that was happening.
So did you get that fixed?

703
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:34,220
That's what the surgery was for.
But it was,

704
00:26:34,221 --> 00:26:35,054
it was a really intense surgery.
I didn't think it was gonna be that big 

705
00:26:36,441 --> 00:26:37,274
of a deal cause I hear about people 
going to get their knees scoped and 

706
00:26:39,171 --> 00:26:40,004
stuff like that,
but I couldn't get out of bed for a 

707
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:42,703
week.
Like I had to have,

708
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:43,980
my mother had to come

709
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:45,360
take care of me and I was like,
you know,

710
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:46,920
it was 32 years old.
I was like,

711
00:26:46,921 --> 00:26:47,754
this is embarrassing,
but I couldn't actually get out of bed 

712
00:26:49,291 --> 00:26:52,920
and move and I ended up having a bad 
reaction to the medication and yeah,

713
00:26:52,921 --> 00:26:54,270
that was,
that was a good time.

714
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:55,870
Time,
surgeries down.

715
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,313
It is.
And what we're saying that the human 

716
00:26:59,031 --> 00:27:01,200
body is just not designed for combat 
sports.

717
00:27:01,201 --> 00:27:02,034
It just,
after a while everyone's sorta gives 

718
00:27:03,741 --> 00:27:04,574
out.
That's why when you see a guy like Dan 

719
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:08,930
Henderson still throwing down whatever,
he was like 46 years old,

720
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:12,200
have you seen Dan walk?
He walks like he's made out of wood,

721
00:27:12,610 --> 00:27:15,040
you know,
walks like he's got no flexibility.

722
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:17,240
Then all of a sudden he's in the cage.
He just comes alive.

723
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:18,283
It's crazy.

724
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:19,243
Something about that.
Greg always called me the Lucille ball 

725
00:27:21,801 --> 00:27:25,040
of him or me because he said that I was 
just the clumsiest person he'd ever met.

726
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:27,020
Like I would just like,
I would trip over every,

727
00:27:27,021 --> 00:27:28,520
I fell down all the time,
but he said,

728
00:27:28,521 --> 00:27:29,354
but when you were fighting you actually 
something like use that phrase came 

729
00:27:31,881 --> 00:27:32,481
alive.
He said you,

730
00:27:32,481 --> 00:27:34,370
you would actually move like you were 
supposed to be moving.

731
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:35,533
So I do think that maybe the human 
body's not meant to take punishment in 

732
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:43,290
combat sports,
but I think we're also built to fight in

733
00:27:43,291 --> 00:27:45,260
a lot of ways.
I mean we've been fighting for years.

734
00:27:45,261 --> 00:27:46,610
It's,
it really is like,

735
00:27:46,611 --> 00:27:49,160
it's Cliche,
but it is kind of in our DNA to scrap.

736
00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:50,243
It has you just,
it's shot just not in your DNA to do it 

737
00:27:51,781 --> 00:27:53,490
all the time and stay alive.
Right.

738
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:57,390
And to sweat your body down to this 
certain part and then go here and then,

739
00:27:57,391 --> 00:27:58,150
you know.
Yeah,

740
00:27:58,150 --> 00:27:59,830
let's talk about that because that is 
the,

741
00:27:59,831 --> 00:28:02,320
one of the most disturbing things it's 
happening lately.

742
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:03,183
Uh,
all these fights that are falling apart 

743
00:28:04,361 --> 00:28:05,194
because people are cutting weight and 
cutting so much weight that they're 

744
00:28:07,511 --> 00:28:08,344
literally on death's door,
mean whack to the hen and Barao fight 

745
00:28:11,501 --> 00:28:15,280
when he was supposed to fight Tj 
dillashaw and fell asleep like,

746
00:28:15,281 --> 00:28:19,510
and banged his head off the wall like to
just a couple weeks ago,

747
00:28:19,511 --> 00:28:20,580
the Habib number,
good madoff,

748
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:21,423
Tony Ferguson fight gets called off,
which is one of the biggest fights of 

749
00:28:23,621 --> 00:28:25,360
the year.
And for fans,

750
00:28:25,361 --> 00:28:28,720
it's just so disappointing because we 
were so looking forward to that fight.

751
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:33,460
What do you think could be done about 
that as a professional,

752
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:34,903
as a professional

753
00:28:35,290 --> 00:28:36,123
and as a commentator?
Let's say it was paid to do commentary 

754
00:28:38,081 --> 00:28:38,914
for Invicta.

755
00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:41,150
I know it was also the matchmaker,
so I was actually,

756
00:28:41,151 --> 00:28:42,470
uh,
I stepped down from that one.

757
00:28:42,471 --> 00:28:45,010
I backed up and went back to school,
so I'm no longer the INVICTA matchmaker,

758
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:48,860
but part of my job was I had this really
regimented checking the girls wait twice

759
00:28:48,861 --> 00:28:50,300
a day,
I should say the fighters wait,

760
00:28:50,301 --> 00:28:51,980
but I'm a girl too,
so I can say girl,

761
00:28:52,610 --> 00:28:53,443
but you know,
I would check their weight twice a day 

762
00:28:54,621 --> 00:28:56,450
and I had them text me their weight and 
I'd be like,

763
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:57,433
okay,
I need you to send me a picture of what 

764
00:28:58,191 --> 00:28:59,990
you're weighing on your scale right now 
and compare it to this.

765
00:29:00,050 --> 00:29:02,060
Like I was,
I was kind of a bitch,

766
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:05,510
but I didn't want fighters missing 
weight on my watch.

767
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:07,310
The problem was they were still going to
Ms.

768
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:08,143
Wade anyway.
It's eight is there's something archaic 

769
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:11,390
about it.
It's not,

770
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:14,420
it needs to change I think more weight 
classes.

771
00:29:14,421 --> 00:29:15,254
You said that before.
I think more weight classes is a really 

772
00:29:16,341 --> 00:29:16,620
good idea.

773
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:18,650
Yeah.
I feel like every 10 pounds yeah.

774
00:29:18,810 --> 00:29:20,460
Is more than reasonable.
I mean,

775
00:29:20,461 --> 00:29:23,790
boxing is way better and way more 
options.

776
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:24,820
Yeah.
I think every,

777
00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:28,840
every six pounds almost would be,
although that's a lot more divisions.

778
00:29:28,841 --> 00:29:29,674
But I mean,
there's so many people who want 

779
00:29:30,191 --> 00:29:31,024
activity.
There's so many people who want to 

780
00:29:31,571 --> 00:29:32,040
fight.

781
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:32,873
I think for women in more importantly,
because when you're talking about six 

782
00:29:35,461 --> 00:29:36,294
pounds,
you're talking about a greater 

783
00:29:36,511 --> 00:29:38,520
percentage of body weight for a lighter 
person.

784
00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:40,950
And when you're talking about 10 pounds 
for a heavyweight,

785
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,130
it's like they take a shit.

786
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:44,590
It's 10 pounds.
You know those giant people like Francis

787
00:29:44,591 --> 00:29:45,424
and Ghana.
Yeah.

788
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:47,080
Look,
I could probably lose 10 pounds in three

789
00:29:47,081 --> 00:29:47,914
minutes if you want it to his shit.
There's so much surface area to sweat 

790
00:29:50,381 --> 00:29:50,890
from.
Yeah.

791
00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:53,440
So massive.
But when you talking about mighty mouse,

792
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:57,160
10 pounds is a giant amount of weight.
It seems like you want to own j check,

793
00:29:57,161 --> 00:29:59,170
you know,
like one 15 so yeah.

794
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:00,850
Oh,
I can't wait to see her at 25 but,

795
00:30:00,851 --> 00:30:01,601
um,
I'm really eight.

796
00:30:01,601 --> 00:30:03,250
Is she going to go?
I don't know,

797
00:30:03,251 --> 00:30:04,540
but I'm hoping,
I'm hoping.

798
00:30:04,541 --> 00:30:07,020
I hope she have a hard time to make 15 I
don't know.

799
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:07,860
I know that she said

800
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:08,693
she's expressed an interest at fighting 
at one 25 which makes me think that one 

801
00:30:10,891 --> 00:30:13,110
15 like I don't,
I've met her maybe twice,

802
00:30:13,111 --> 00:30:15,210
so I've never had a lengthy discussion 
with her.

803
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:16,770
She's so bad ass.
I know.

804
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:17,633
I,
every time she fights I just get so 

805
00:30:18,901 --> 00:30:19,370
excited.

806
00:30:19,370 --> 00:30:23,000
She's so far Roche's I know.
She's so ferocious.

807
00:30:23,001 --> 00:30:26,000
Like I'll watch that a fight with her 
and Jessica pinay again.

808
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:27,770
It's like good Lord.
Yeah.

809
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:28,693
Like when she smells blood and she 
starts attacking is smashing with 

810
00:30:31,221 --> 00:30:33,560
elbows.
Like she's one of the scariest people in

811
00:30:33,561 --> 00:30:35,130
the sport now and it's beautiful isn't 
it?

812
00:30:35,131 --> 00:30:35,964
They get her off you,
you can't get her off right at the end 

813
00:30:38,031 --> 00:30:38,864
of her punches and yeah,
she knows exactly what to do with 

814
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:41,633
renaming everything every,
so she's so technical and she's just so 

815
00:30:45,170 --> 00:30:46,880
goddamn aggressive,
you know?

816
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:48,650
Poof.
Technical,

817
00:30:48,651 --> 00:30:50,160
aggressive,
ferocious.

818
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:54,890
She gives really cookies and ship before
she beats her head.

819
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:56,220
Yeah.
I love that.

820
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:57,413
I love that.
That that entertainment side of it was 

821
00:30:59,161 --> 00:30:59,994
never something I captured myself.
Like I didn't have that little niche 

822
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:04,590
sort of.
But when I see fighters do that,

823
00:31:04,591 --> 00:31:09,420
like her who can be the full package,
you can destroy an opponent and make the

824
00:31:09,421 --> 00:31:12,540
fans look forward to just watching her 
walk onto a stage.

825
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:13,630
I love that.
I'm just like,

826
00:31:13,690 --> 00:31:15,400
well that's really who she is,
you know?

827
00:31:15,401 --> 00:31:16,234
I mean,
she's not,

828
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:17,760
she's not faking it.
Yeah.

829
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:18,460
Who she is.

830
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:20,230
And when we talk about branding and 
stuff like that,

831
00:31:20,231 --> 00:31:21,064
you kind of wonder who falls into the 
category of staying who they are as a 

832
00:31:23,771 --> 00:31:24,900
brand,
as a fighter.

833
00:31:24,910 --> 00:31:27,070
Who,
who creates something for themselves and

834
00:31:27,071 --> 00:31:31,030
how much of that is actually authentic 
or how much they try to pretend.

835
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:32,020
Right?
Right.

836
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:33,200
Yeah.
Yeah.

837
00:31:33,201 --> 00:31:35,930
And when you do fake it,
everybody sort of sees it,

838
00:31:35,931 --> 00:31:38,430
you're faking it and it comes off gross 
and they get mad at you.

839
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,550
Right.
A guy like conor,

840
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:41,533
you know like that famous press 
conference where Jeremy Stevens calls 

841
00:31:43,851 --> 00:31:46,940
him out and he goes,
who the fuck is that guy at?

842
00:31:46,941 --> 00:31:49,850
The speed that he has is natural.
I mean,

843
00:31:49,851 --> 00:31:52,520
it is who he is.
He just knows how to do it.

844
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,890
And so when he does it,
it's effortless.

845
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:58,010
But when some people try to just look so
goofy,

846
00:31:58,011 --> 00:31:59,090
it's just,
oh,

847
00:31:59,091 --> 00:31:59,924
it's worse.
People want to see you lose when you do 

848
00:32:01,041 --> 00:32:01,320
that.
Yeah.

849
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,410
Does it,
does it,

850
00:32:02,411 --> 00:32:03,244
it's,
it comes as inauthentic and it's the 

851
00:32:04,181 --> 00:32:06,860
last weird demand that we have as fans.
Cause I,

852
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,270
I don't consider myself a fighter 
anymore.

853
00:32:08,271 --> 00:32:11,330
I'm a fight fan now,
but we have this demand for the fighters

854
00:32:11,331 --> 00:32:15,200
to be authentic when they're fighting.
But also when they present themselves,

855
00:32:15,201 --> 00:32:18,110
they have to be themselves somehow.
Or we call them fake or we call it,

856
00:32:18,111 --> 00:32:18,521
you know,
it's like,

857
00:32:18,521 --> 00:32:19,130
it's,
it's,

858
00:32:19,130 --> 00:32:20,780
we have a lot of demands on fighters.

859
00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:21,703
Well,
you're putting them under this massive 

860
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:23,570
microscope.
I mean,

861
00:32:23,571 --> 00:32:27,860
you're seeing someone,
when you see two fighters go to war,

862
00:32:27,890 --> 00:32:30,020
you're seeing their souls bared out.
Yeah.

863
00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:31,163
I mean you,
you see so much in what they're capable 

864
00:32:34,881 --> 00:32:35,600
of.
Like how the,

865
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,030
the capable of focusing,
pushing themselves,

866
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,430
what they've to discipline themselves

867
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:42,170
to get ready physically.
I mean,

868
00:32:42,171 --> 00:32:43,004
you could see that,
that you see them express themselves 

869
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:47,660
with their endurance,
like talking about mighty mouse again.

870
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:51,740
Like you see what amount of work that 
guys put in in the gym.

871
00:32:51,741 --> 00:32:52,574
When you see him in the fifth round,
moving a thousand miles an hour and not 

872
00:32:54,621 --> 00:32:55,454
even breathing heavy.
It's like there's an expression in that 

873
00:32:57,861 --> 00:33:00,530
like you're,
you're seeing something that this guy is

874
00:33:00,531 --> 00:33:02,570
like showing you everything he's got.
He's showing,

875
00:33:02,571 --> 00:33:03,680
showing you his full care.

876
00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:04,760
Yeah.
And he's showing,

877
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:05,623
there's that click that happens with 
some fighters where they're getting 

878
00:33:07,431 --> 00:33:09,820
beaten down and all of a sudden they 
turn it around me.

879
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,240
She takes a great example of that.
Like,

880
00:33:11,241 --> 00:33:12,500
you know,
and her fight with holly,

881
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,300
like she kicked my ass too.
What the arm bar.

882
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:14,990
You know,
she,

883
00:33:14,990 --> 00:33:15,823
she turns it around.
Something happens in there and you can 

884
00:33:17,481 --> 00:33:18,314
see that that's the warrior thing that 
has one actual wars in people where 

885
00:33:22,701 --> 00:33:23,331
they've,
you know,

886
00:33:23,331 --> 00:33:24,590
like,
I don't know,

887
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,540
it makes me think of Henry the fifth a 
little bit,

888
00:33:26,541 --> 00:33:27,374
you know,
like those moments where we are 

889
00:33:28,671 --> 00:33:30,230
outnumbered,
this is going to suck.

890
00:33:30,231 --> 00:33:32,030
I'm losing,
everything's going against me.

891
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:33,230
All right,
here I go.

892
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:35,000
I'm still going to keep pushing.
And it's like,

893
00:33:35,001 --> 00:33:35,834
you know,
it's like moments like that if you can 

894
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:39,253
look at fighting from,
I guess you don't take fighting 

895
00:33:41,151 --> 00:33:43,160
personally.
Maybe,

896
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:45,110
I don't know how to explain it by taking
it personally.

897
00:33:45,111 --> 00:33:49,790
But if you can invest yourself in those 
moments of glory for another person,

898
00:33:50,090 --> 00:33:52,970
did you get inspired?
You get really turned on to the,

899
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:57,500
to the whole sport and you really 
understand and you can see the human.

900
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,593
Is that easier for you to do now that 
you've retired than it was to do while 

901
00:34:00,821 --> 00:34:01,654
you're competing?
Did you like compare yourself against 

902
00:34:02,741 --> 00:34:03,230
those goals?
Oh,

903
00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:05,330
too much.
I'm the most,

904
00:34:05,850 --> 00:34:09,470
I am a terrible person and I think I was
just,

905
00:34:09,471 --> 00:34:10,480
I mean,
you know,

906
00:34:10,530 --> 00:34:11,363
I,
I think mentally I defeated myself more 

907
00:34:13,431 --> 00:34:15,500
than I ever did physically.
Like I,

908
00:34:15,501 --> 00:34:16,334
you know,
I,

909
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:17,353
but yeah,
I always compared myself against other 

910
00:34:18,681 --> 00:34:19,401
people and it was,
it was like,

911
00:34:19,401 --> 00:34:20,690
oh my gosh,
this person's doing this,

912
00:34:20,691 --> 00:34:21,351
this,
this.

913
00:34:21,351 --> 00:34:22,640
I'm not getting that.
I'm not doing that.

914
00:34:22,641 --> 00:34:25,190
I've got to go this direction.
And the,

915
00:34:25,191 --> 00:34:26,024
um,
the pressure I think on female fighters 

916
00:34:27,561 --> 00:34:31,240
and it wasn't exactly an outright 
pressure to to know,

917
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:33,390
be sexy or be hot or something like 
that.

918
00:34:33,391 --> 00:34:35,630
And then I tried that so hard when I 
first started fighting.

919
00:34:35,890 --> 00:34:36,723
Like I took the nude pictures and I 
tried to be the sexy girl and I just 

920
00:34:38,721 --> 00:34:41,060
could not pull it off.
You could see in my face,

921
00:34:41,061 --> 00:34:42,410
I'm just like,
doofy girl,

922
00:34:42,411 --> 00:34:43,670
you know,
I didn't have that.

923
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:44,503
Like,
um,

924
00:34:44,850 --> 00:34:48,260
I'm a huge fan of sex and sexuality and 
how people want to express it.

925
00:34:48,261 --> 00:34:49,094
It's amazing.
But for me it just had nothing to do 

926
00:34:50,691 --> 00:34:51,680
with combat.
Right.

927
00:34:51,681 --> 00:34:52,730
And so the,
the fighters,

928
00:34:52,731 --> 00:34:54,710
the female fighters who could combine 
that,

929
00:34:54,711 --> 00:34:55,760
to me it was just,
it was,

930
00:34:56,150 --> 00:34:57,170
I was befuddled.
I was like,

931
00:34:57,171 --> 00:34:58,004
how do they do that?
How do they put that together like that 

932
00:35:00,051 --> 00:35:00,920
and still,
you know,

933
00:35:00,921 --> 00:35:04,250
feel tough or still feel ferocious?
Because I mean,

934
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:07,490
sex is ridiculously fun and sexuality is
like awesome,

935
00:35:07,491 --> 00:35:08,720
but it's also,
to me,

936
00:35:08,721 --> 00:35:11,420
it's not punching people in the face.
And so it was,

937
00:35:11,421 --> 00:35:12,800
and I would always compare myself to,
oh,

938
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:14,180
I should do that.
I should do that,

939
00:35:14,181 --> 00:35:15,440
you know,
but I can't do that.

940
00:35:15,441 --> 00:35:17,000
It's just inauthentic.
And I think,

941
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:18,110
I dunno,
to me,

942
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:18,943
authenticity is just like weird,
huge part of my life that I'm trying to 

943
00:35:22,131 --> 00:35:25,190
study with my writing and stuff.
But it's,

944
00:35:25,191 --> 00:35:26,570
it's,
it's funny how,

945
00:35:26,571 --> 00:35:30,110
um,
I would see them just like karate hottie

946
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,270
for example,
like she came into the gym,

947
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:33,440
I'm into Jackson.
Shorter.

948
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:34,311
Yeah.
Michelle waterson.

949
00:35:34,311 --> 00:35:34,701
Yeah,
yeah.

950
00:35:34,701 --> 00:35:35,900
Michelle don't know.
Yeah,

951
00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:37,920
we call her nuts or peanut,
but yeah,

952
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:39,533
Tina.
Yeah,

953
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:41,040
because she's so little.
Um,

954
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:41,903
but she,
um,

955
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:44,280
when she came to the gym,
she was just like little hooters model.

956
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:45,470
I was like,
who the fucking system?

957
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:47,680
You know what?
I almost conard like Hickman.

958
00:35:48,090 --> 00:35:49,230
And um,
then she,

959
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:51,480
I had a black eye when we were sparring 
the first time.

960
00:35:51,481 --> 00:35:53,010
Then she gave me another black guy,
like right away,

961
00:35:53,011 --> 00:35:54,060
the first time sparring just,
Bam,

962
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:55,800
kicked me right in the face and it was 
just like,

963
00:35:55,830 --> 00:35:56,880
oh,
I like her.

964
00:35:56,881 --> 00:35:57,714
But I was also like,
I had these hangups about it because I 

965
00:35:59,311 --> 00:36:00,144
was so uncomfortable with that sort of 
marketing and that way of presenting 

966
00:36:02,761 --> 00:36:04,560
yourself.
And also women weren't in the UFC then,

967
00:36:04,561 --> 00:36:06,840
you know,
our opportunities were so weird and so I

968
00:36:06,841 --> 00:36:07,674
would,
I would question people who would push 

969
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:13,860
that side of themselves so much and then
not I'm the fighter woman,

970
00:36:13,861 --> 00:36:14,580
I'm going to do this.

971
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:17,110
You know what I'm saying?
Exactly.

972
00:36:17,790 --> 00:36:19,950
Is My space then,
which is embarrassing.

973
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:22,690
But,
and then um,

974
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:25,770
it's funny cause I had this tension with
her because I was like,

975
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:28,350
I don't want to market myself in that 
direction.

976
00:36:28,351 --> 00:36:31,650
It's not who I am exactly.
When it comes to mma.

977
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,180
And then,
um,

978
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:37,710
of course greg sense that there was an 
uncomfortableness between us and he took

979
00:36:37,711 --> 00:36:40,200
us up to the top of the mountain and 
made us run sprints until we were crying

980
00:36:40,201 --> 00:36:41,700
and holding onto each other and became 
sisters.

981
00:36:41,701 --> 00:36:42,870
Like it was just like,
he was just like,

982
00:36:42,871 --> 00:36:44,730
all that's bullshit.
You are sisters,

983
00:36:44,731 --> 00:36:46,560
your training partners is,
you're here for each other.

984
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:48,720
And it was amazing.
It was just like an something clicked in

985
00:36:48,721 --> 00:36:49,890
my mind where I was just like,
oh yeah,

986
00:36:49,891 --> 00:36:51,960
she can promote herself however the fuck
she wants to.

987
00:36:54,090 --> 00:36:54,691
Yeah,
exactly.

988
00:36:54,691 --> 00:36:57,420
She's [inaudible] that's how she is.
That's who she is.

989
00:36:57,421 --> 00:36:59,910
She was a model like that.
That was her profession before this.

990
00:36:59,911 --> 00:37:01,120
So it,
it,

991
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:02,013
it made a lot more sense to me when I 
could step back out of what the boxes 

992
00:37:05,581 --> 00:37:06,414
that I had placed myself under.
The container's not necessarily boxes 

993
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:09,353
cause it can feel closed in,
but the containers that I was 

994
00:37:10,741 --> 00:37:14,280
comfortable working within for myself or
at the same for the person next to me.

995
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:15,960
And so,
you know,

996
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:16,913
it taught me to have a little bit more 
respect for people who want to combine 

997
00:37:20,791 --> 00:37:22,560
everything the way they want to combine 
it.

998
00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:23,583
I think there's a natural inclination to
try to shoot down potential rivals or 

999
00:37:26,971 --> 00:37:28,160
potential,
you know,

1000
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:31,050
you're looking at people and you're 
trying to pick apart what they do.

1001
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:33,960
I mean,
in a lot of ways when you're a fighter,

1002
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:36,000
you have predatory instincts.

1003
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:36,901
I mean,
you must,

1004
00:37:36,901 --> 00:37:39,180
when you're sizing up a pewter opponent,
there's,

1005
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:40,063
there's no way you're not looking at 
things they do wrong or things that you 

1006
00:37:42,751 --> 00:37:44,460
think you can exploit.
Or maybe,

1007
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:45,653
you know,
maybe she doesn't work hard enough or 

1008
00:37:47,191 --> 00:37:49,710
maybe she misses,
wait because her disciplines off.

1009
00:37:49,711 --> 00:37:50,544
And you start,
you start looking for holes in their 

1010
00:37:52,351 --> 00:37:53,184
game and you're going to,
you're going to do that with a rival in 

1011
00:37:54,811 --> 00:37:56,490
the gym as well.
Of course you are an eight.

1012
00:37:56,491 --> 00:37:58,080
You know,
I wouldn't even go so far to say we were

1013
00:37:58,081 --> 00:38:00,120
rivals is I was 30 pounds heavier than 
her,

1014
00:38:00,121 --> 00:38:01,690
so I was just a bully.
But,

1015
00:38:02,490 --> 00:38:03,323
but you know,
the truth of matter is also because 

1016
00:38:04,891 --> 00:38:07,020
especially the early terrain of women in
the sport,

1017
00:38:07,021 --> 00:38:08,730
when there was another woman who came 
into the gym,

1018
00:38:08,731 --> 00:38:12,330
this can either be your best training 
partner other or ever,

1019
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,280
or it could be somebody coming in here,
you know,

1020
00:38:14,281 --> 00:38:15,690
to pick up,
you don't know.

1021
00:38:15,690 --> 00:38:17,610
And I'm think men look at the gym that 
way too.

1022
00:38:17,611 --> 00:38:18,444
I think that they,
they size each other up in the gym with 

1023
00:38:19,591 --> 00:38:21,060
a new partner coming in and stuff like 
that.

1024
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:25,080
And it's interesting because it sounds 
so sexist when I say it,

1025
00:38:25,081 --> 00:38:27,290
but it's also,
I don't want to lie,

1026
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:28,680
sit here and lie to you and say,
I think that,

1027
00:38:28,681 --> 00:38:29,700
you know,
like I,

1028
00:38:29,790 --> 00:38:31,290
when other women would come into the 
gym,

1029
00:38:31,291 --> 00:38:32,250
I would be like,
Yay.

1030
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,233
You know,
that evolved over time and especially 

1031
00:38:34,561 --> 00:38:37,780
because the atmosphere that greg created
there was incredible.

1032
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:40,660
Like I was the first mma girl really in 
that gym.

1033
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:43,270
And then,
you know,

1034
00:38:43,271 --> 00:38:45,580
and then Michelle was there and then 
other people and now it's like there's a

1035
00:38:45,581 --> 00:38:49,000
huge women's team over there.
What was it like to be sparring with men

1036
00:38:49,001 --> 00:38:49,834
when you were the first woman there to 
be doing most of your training with men 

1037
00:38:52,570 --> 00:38:54,070
and then going in there fighting women?

1038
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:56,320
They were all sizes,
but you know,

1039
00:38:56,321 --> 00:38:58,090
I'll be honest,
I think training with women is important

1040
00:38:58,091 --> 00:39:00,580
if you're fighting women.
I think that there's a different kind of

1041
00:39:00,581 --> 00:39:02,650
intensity and flexibility,
um,

1042
00:39:02,770 --> 00:39:03,603
in body types.
And I don't know that that's completely 

1043
00:39:05,381 --> 00:39:06,214
across the board,
but I did find it better to have female 

1044
00:39:07,631 --> 00:39:08,464
sparring partners.
And I was very fortunate in that Holly 

1045
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:14,080
Holm was at the gym boxing and she could
kick box and she knew how to sprawl.

1046
00:39:14,081 --> 00:39:16,660
So you know,
I was still getting sparring with,

1047
00:39:16,661 --> 00:39:18,550
with women there and Jodie Esquibel,
uh,

1048
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:19,863
she,
um,

1049
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:22,000
man,
she was fighting at one oh five.

1050
00:39:22,001 --> 00:39:22,834
And I remember Keith had me spa her for 
10 rounds and she dropped me twice and 

1051
00:39:24,891 --> 00:39:29,260
one oh five or I have terrible chin.
Like I would just say just box like this

1052
00:39:29,261 --> 00:39:31,800
all the time.
But I used to eight karate style.

1053
00:39:32,050 --> 00:39:32,840
Oh,
I know.

1054
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:36,000
So hard to get out of that.
I had a really good job.

1055
00:39:36,130 --> 00:39:36,963
I was rarely knocked out,
but it was the jaw that I put in front 

1056
00:39:39,221 --> 00:39:41,200
of people constantly.
It's always like,

1057
00:39:41,201 --> 00:39:42,034
come on,
hit me.

1058
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:44,320
Did you ever think about doing 
professional boxing?

1059
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:45,341
I did.
I did.

1060
00:39:45,341 --> 00:39:46,450
I thought about it.
Um,

1061
00:39:46,870 --> 00:39:47,710
especially,
you know,

1062
00:39:47,711 --> 00:39:49,390
when,
cause there was a quite,

1063
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:53,170
quite a few female boxers in that gym 
and I thought it would be an interesting

1064
00:39:53,171 --> 00:39:54,910
thing to do,
but I just never took that path.

1065
00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:55,983
I was an,
I was a pretty decent boxing sparring 

1066
00:39:57,461 --> 00:39:57,911
partner.
Like,

1067
00:39:57,911 --> 00:39:59,260
I learned how to imitate,
you know,

1068
00:39:59,290 --> 00:40:01,540
their opponents and stuff.
But yeah,

1069
00:40:01,541 --> 00:40:04,600
I think I was always better in the gym 
that I actually wasn't competition.

1070
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:06,730
Now,
throughout your career,

1071
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:07,893
did you worry at all about head trauma?
Did you worry about the consequences of 

1072
00:40:10,981 --> 00:40:11,790
until after?

1073
00:40:11,790 --> 00:40:13,120
Not Til after it.
Until after.

1074
00:40:13,121 --> 00:40:14,250
Why,
why after?

1075
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:17,770
Cause you didn't want to think about it 
or was he conscious decision and I think

1076
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:21,130
you have that mentality.
You can be anyone in anything,

1077
00:40:21,131 --> 00:40:22,330
even your own body.
Right.

1078
00:40:22,810 --> 00:40:25,510
So it was like I'm not going to let that
kind of negativity into my life if I get

1079
00:40:25,511 --> 00:40:26,350
knocked out,
whatever,

1080
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:28,840
you know.
But my last fight I do remember,

1081
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,910
um,
my jaw was out a little bit.

1082
00:40:30,911 --> 00:40:31,744
I had like somebody just adjust my job 
cause I kept getting dropped in the 

1083
00:40:33,881 --> 00:40:35,560
sparring for my last fight and I was 
just like,

1084
00:40:35,561 --> 00:40:37,720
oh this sucks.
[inaudible] you got your jaw.

1085
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:38,351
Yeah.
He was like,

1086
00:40:38,351 --> 00:40:40,480
yeah,
I dunno there was a chiropractor on hand

1087
00:40:40,481 --> 00:40:42,730
and I don't know how legit it wasn't,
it wasn't legit.

1088
00:40:42,731 --> 00:40:44,770
He seems like a really nice guy.
He was an Ortho therapist and he said,

1089
00:40:44,771 --> 00:40:45,670
your jaws offline.

1090
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:48,460
And then he like did some kind of thing 
and I stopped getting dropped,

1091
00:40:48,461 --> 00:40:51,360
which was nice.
But I don't really jive.

1092
00:40:51,610 --> 00:40:52,443
It doesn't.
So I don't know how much of that was 

1093
00:40:53,831 --> 00:40:55,880
psychosomatic.
Yeah.

1094
00:40:55,930 --> 00:40:56,920
And me just thinking,
okay,

1095
00:40:56,921 --> 00:40:59,350
this is what fixes me getting dropped or
whatever.

1096
00:40:59,351 --> 00:41:00,184
But I did think towards the end,
if I got dropped three times inspiring 

1097
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:06,070
before the fight with [inaudible] and 
that was in one day and I was like,

1098
00:41:06,071 --> 00:41:07,150
okay,
this is,

1099
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:09,550
yeah,
we'll know.

1100
00:41:09,551 --> 00:41:11,590
They pulled me out.
If you have to stop now,

1101
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:13,530
you think after the first,
well,

1102
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:15,700
I don't think everybody was,
I mean it's a big sparring room.

1103
00:41:15,701 --> 00:41:16,960
I don't think people,
yeah,

1104
00:41:16,961 --> 00:41:18,400
I don't think people are paying that 
much attention.

1105
00:41:18,401 --> 00:41:20,200
I mean,
there's a lot going on then when you get

1106
00:41:20,201 --> 00:41:22,240
dropped,
was it a flash knockdown or did you feel

1107
00:41:22,241 --> 00:41:23,074
your legs go flash knockdown?
I don't think I've ever been completely 

1108
00:41:26,351 --> 00:41:28,120
unconscious.
Um,

1109
00:41:28,630 --> 00:41:31,270
I yawned limp and then gotten back up.
Yeah.

1110
00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:32,920
Yeah.
And it's the same thing.

1111
00:41:32,921 --> 00:41:33,980
You,
you

1112
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:35,510
don't recognize your weakness,
right?

1113
00:41:35,511 --> 00:41:38,030
You don't recognize that your brain 
could have problems,

1114
00:41:38,031 --> 00:41:38,731
you don't reckon,
you know?

1115
00:41:38,731 --> 00:41:38,860
Right.

1116
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:40,370
Right.
As long as you're walking and moving,

1117
00:41:41,110 --> 00:41:42,210
you have to keep going for.

1118
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:43,900
Right.
And I think that that mentality,

1119
00:41:43,901 --> 00:41:45,980
I don't want to,
um,

1120
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:47,673
I don't want to disrespect that 
mentality because I think that's also 

1121
00:41:49,481 --> 00:41:50,314
the mentality that makes champions.
But if you never became a champion and 

1122
00:41:55,230 --> 00:41:56,980
you went through that,
you kind of wonder,

1123
00:41:57,220 --> 00:41:59,220
I didn't make great choices with my life
right now.

1124
00:41:59,290 --> 00:41:59,631
Right,
right,

1125
00:41:59,631 --> 00:42:00,320
right,
right.

1126
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:02,900
No,
I think what you're saying rings true to

1127
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:05,360
pretty much anybody that follows a 
sport.

1128
00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:09,380
Like we really admire those Diego 
Sanchez warriors.

1129
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:12,290
You know,
Diego Sanchez fight.

1130
00:42:12,291 --> 00:42:13,790
And I'm watching,
you know,

1131
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:15,650
I wouldn't want my kid to fight the way 
he fights.

1132
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:16,280
Right.
You know,

1133
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:19,070
diego fights like a,
like a God damn human wolverine.

1134
00:42:19,230 --> 00:42:19,971
You know,
he just,

1135
00:42:19,971 --> 00:42:23,330
he's just a beast.
Just charge forward.

1136
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:24,680
You know?
I mean,

1137
00:42:24,681 --> 00:42:26,780
and he's been stopped and he's lost.
But

1138
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:27,580
okay.

1139
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:28,413
It's just the,
the ferocity and which he approaches 

1140
00:42:30,911 --> 00:42:32,650
fighting.
It's just,

1141
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:35,710
it's heart and will,
and just determination.

1142
00:42:35,711 --> 00:42:40,711
And it's all together in this,
this indomitable spirit package.

1143
00:42:41,230 --> 00:42:42,490
You know what I mean?
It's a very,

1144
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:43,473
I mean,
diego might not be a world champion and 

1145
00:42:44,801 --> 00:42:45,634
you might not ever win a world title,
but the amount of fans that guy has won 

1146
00:42:48,851 --> 00:42:50,950
just by,
because when he's so entertaining,

1147
00:42:50,951 --> 00:42:51,784
like if what you're trying to see when 
you're watching two people fight is one 

1148
00:42:54,881 --> 00:42:55,714
person try to figure out a way to 
triumph over the obstacle in front of 

1149
00:42:59,621 --> 00:43:01,090
them.
That is the person over the,

1150
00:43:01,091 --> 00:43:01,924
the body that wants to stop over the 
lungs that are burning over the legs 

1151
00:43:06,341 --> 00:43:07,174
that are giving out.
Okay.

1152
00:43:07,250 --> 00:43:09,500
Do you think that rings true now in 
entertainment,

1153
00:43:09,501 --> 00:43:11,220
in sports?
Do you think that the uh,

1154
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:13,610
the UFC or Belgium or whatever show is 
on,

1155
00:43:13,611 --> 00:43:15,470
do you think that that's still what 
people are looking for

1156
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:17,270
sometimes.
Sometimes.

1157
00:43:17,271 --> 00:43:18,830
I mean,
I don't always look for it.

1158
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:19,873
Like I got criticized because people 
said that the Tyron Woodley Stephen 

1159
00:43:23,181 --> 00:43:24,620
Wonderboy Thompson fight wasn't a good 
fight.

1160
00:43:24,621 --> 00:43:26,090
And I'm like,
while that fight was going on,

1161
00:43:26,091 --> 00:43:26,924
I was on the edge of my seat because at 
any moment it could have gotten amazing 

1162
00:43:29,810 --> 00:43:30,643
at any moment.

1163
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:33,150
Dan doing well before their techniques 
almost.

1164
00:43:33,151 --> 00:43:34,560
I mean not consciously doing mad,
but they,

1165
00:43:34,561 --> 00:43:35,394
you know,
they're,

1166
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:37,680
they're adjusting to each other and 
second of the fight.

1167
00:43:37,710 --> 00:43:38,080
Yeah.

1168
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:39,920
And um,
I thought it,

1169
00:43:40,030 --> 00:43:42,640
I thought it was fascinating,
but that wonderboy was playing this very

1170
00:43:42,641 --> 00:43:43,474
conservative stay on the outside thing 
and Tyron Woodley in order to close the 

1171
00:43:46,391 --> 00:43:48,070
distance.
He had a risk getting hit and he got hit

1172
00:43:48,071 --> 00:43:50,980
a few times.
I mean it was a fascinating fight to me,

1173
00:43:51,340 --> 00:43:52,173
but people don't want chess matches.
They want the last minute of the last 

1174
00:43:54,971 --> 00:43:55,804
round when Tyron connected and Wonderboy
was wobbling and looked like he was 

1175
00:43:58,811 --> 00:44:00,100
going out,
that's what they want.

1176
00:44:00,101 --> 00:44:03,610
They want slobber knocker rocky.
Especially people that don't train,

1177
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:06,130
they just just watch the sport and they 
just think,

1178
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:07,533
you know,
oh,

1179
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:09,190
I want to see somebody get their ass 
kicked.

1180
00:44:09,191 --> 00:44:10,024
You know,
they don't care that someone is using 

1181
00:44:11,861 --> 00:44:12,694
amazing foot work or that someone has a 
completely different style than what 

1182
00:44:15,701 --> 00:44:16,534
people are used to wonder why,
what that sideways sport sport karate 

1183
00:44:19,721 --> 00:44:23,710
stance so difficult to decipher when 
he's also so good at timing.

1184
00:44:23,710 --> 00:44:24,543
It is his sliding in.
And out movement is so good and his 

1185
00:44:26,981 --> 00:44:28,650
ground is very good too.
And he just,

1186
00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:30,470
he doesn't have to go there that often.
Yeah.

1187
00:44:30,530 --> 00:44:32,100
Yes.
I just,

1188
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:34,830
I,
I'm a fan of the whole thing.

1189
00:44:34,860 --> 00:44:36,600
I like all of it.
I like wars.

1190
00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:37,463
I liked tactical matches.
I like a guy like mighty mouse who just 

1191
00:44:40,171 --> 00:44:41,700
barely ever gets hit.
Yeah.

1192
00:44:42,250 --> 00:44:43,083
And I like someone like Diego that comes
out biting down on his mouthpiece and 

1193
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:47,500
you,
you know,

1194
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:49,530
it could be covered in blood and he just
fights harder.

1195
00:44:49,670 --> 00:44:50,503
Diego Sanchez,
one more third rounds when he got his 

1196
00:44:52,381 --> 00:44:53,530
ass kicked.
The first two,

1197
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:56,160
like anybody,
the Gilbert Melendez fight,

1198
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:57,473
you know that Jake Ellenberger,
you know the last minute of the fight 

1199
00:45:00,061 --> 00:45:01,380
he's on,
Jake ellenberger is back,

1200
00:45:01,381 --> 00:45:03,330
punched him in the head.
It's crazy.

1201
00:45:03,331 --> 00:45:08,250
He's just so ferocious at the Martin 
Marvin Kamin.

1202
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:09,990
Same thing.
Martin Kampmann fight.

1203
00:45:10,170 --> 00:45:13,790
Martin Kampmann had him like his face 
was hanging off,

1204
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:17,520
it was hanging off and he's still 
chasing them down to third round.

1205
00:45:17,521 --> 00:45:19,110
Might just nobody more ferocious than 
that.

1206
00:45:19,170 --> 00:45:20,090
Yeah.
Then,

1207
00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:21,390
but you know,
and it's the times like that,

1208
00:45:21,391 --> 00:45:25,770
like how can you not admire that?
How can you not want to see that or find

1209
00:45:25,771 --> 00:45:28,290
something in yourself?
It's like that the will not give up.

1210
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:29,573
That if you're at the brink of,
I mean not necessarily death because 

1211
00:45:31,830 --> 00:45:33,450
it's just an enactment right of that.
Right.

1212
00:45:34,010 --> 00:45:35,570
Let's be real though and we don't want 
to,

1213
00:45:35,630 --> 00:45:39,680
we were kind of being nice about it,
but it is kind of at the brink of death.

1214
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:42,980
I mean Robbie Mcdonnell,
Robbie lawler and Rory Macdonald,

1215
00:45:43,370 --> 00:45:46,340
that was to me the brink of death.
I mean you're,

1216
00:45:46,341 --> 00:45:51,080
you're getting really close.
Those guys were fucking going to war and

1217
00:45:51,081 --> 00:45:51,914
when Rorys knows caved in and blood's 
pouring out of his face and he just 

1218
00:45:55,071 --> 00:45:56,840
collapses and he couldn't take it 
anymore.

1219
00:45:57,170 --> 00:45:59,060
I mean,
how far away from death is that?

1220
00:45:59,090 --> 00:46:01,580
It's an a couple blocks.
This is the same neighbor.

1221
00:46:01,581 --> 00:46:03,620
You could see death from there,
that's for sure.

1222
00:46:04,110 --> 00:46:04,943
But does that,
when you're watching it or when you're 

1223
00:46:05,881 --> 00:46:07,290
analyzing a,
do you feel,

1224
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:10,110
does that feel differently than when you
first started?

1225
00:46:10,620 --> 00:46:12,960
I guess watching it,
analyzing when you see these moments now

1226
00:46:13,110 --> 00:46:13,940
feels bad.
One,

1227
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:14,351
it,
it,

1228
00:46:14,351 --> 00:46:16,190
it does bother me when I know them too.
Well,

1229
00:46:16,370 --> 00:46:18,530
you know when I know them too well and 
a,

1230
00:46:18,531 --> 00:46:21,260
I see them getting,
when I see a fight like,

1231
00:46:21,261 --> 00:46:24,380
um,
like Rory Macdonald,

1232
00:46:24,381 --> 00:46:25,340
Robbie Lawler,
why no?

1233
00:46:25,370 --> 00:46:27,290
Okay.
Whoever wins this fight.

1234
00:46:27,470 --> 00:46:29,150
Neither one of those guys going to be 
the same again.

1235
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:34,010
They gave a part of who they were in 
that fight and you know,

1236
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:36,660
Don fries said that once about his fight
with uh,

1237
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:39,110
Ken shamrock.
He said,

1238
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:40,393
whoever won that fight,
it doesn't matter because we both lost 

1239
00:46:42,861 --> 00:46:44,600
something.
We both lost who,

1240
00:46:44,601 --> 00:46:48,280
whoever we were when we went in there,
we weren't at the same guy when we left.

1241
00:46:48,370 --> 00:46:50,510
[inaudible] you know that we left 
something.

1242
00:46:50,511 --> 00:46:51,860
He goes,
I don't know if Ken's going to admit it,

1243
00:46:51,861 --> 00:46:53,900
but I'll tell you,
I lost something in there.

1244
00:46:53,901 --> 00:46:55,190
I'm not the same person anymore.

1245
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:56,160
Yeah.
You know,

1246
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:57,770
it's funny.
It's,

1247
00:46:57,840 --> 00:46:59,180
it's so much,
I guess I'm,

1248
00:46:59,181 --> 00:47:00,014
I'm working on so many writing projects 
right now and so many things that I'm 

1249
00:47:02,431 --> 00:47:05,040
trying to analyze mma from such a 
different perspective now,

1250
00:47:05,041 --> 00:47:08,700
but if you think about it,
what they've sacrificed to that canvas,

1251
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,610
like what they've given,
like all of these fighters,

1252
00:47:11,611 --> 00:47:12,444
all of these grades and all of these not
greats who've still given that part of 

1253
00:47:14,641 --> 00:47:16,260
themselves to that canvas.
And You wonder,

1254
00:47:16,850 --> 00:47:18,660
uh,
what's the payback exactly.

1255
00:47:18,990 --> 00:47:20,780
What,
what do you get from that Tori?

1256
00:47:21,260 --> 00:47:22,093
Yeah.

1257
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:24,450
What are those moments,
those moments in the,

1258
00:47:24,451 --> 00:47:28,290
and also this understanding that you are
the type of person that can persevere.

1259
00:47:29,530 --> 00:47:30,220
I mean,

1260
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:33,850
we've,
we've settled the world basically,

1261
00:47:33,851 --> 00:47:34,930
you know,
we've been all over the world.

1262
00:47:34,931 --> 00:47:36,940
We know,
we know the world,

1263
00:47:36,970 --> 00:47:38,440
we know space.
We're getting out there,

1264
00:47:38,441 --> 00:47:40,000
we're figuring those things out.
But these are the,

1265
00:47:40,210 --> 00:47:41,043
almost the worlds and the spaces and the
glories let that fight for glory in 

1266
00:47:43,841 --> 00:47:47,650
these strange heterotopic spaces that we
create for ourselves.

1267
00:47:47,651 --> 00:47:49,860
So that what's a heterotopic space?
It's like a,

1268
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:50,800
uh,
it's a,

1269
00:47:50,801 --> 00:47:51,940
it's a full cult thing.
It's,

1270
00:47:51,941 --> 00:47:53,050
um,
um,

1271
00:47:53,110 --> 00:47:53,980
I guess,
well this is like,

1272
00:47:53,981 --> 00:47:54,814
I was like,
I was just gonna actually ask you with 

1273
00:47:55,541 --> 00:47:58,210
podcasting and stuff like that,
it's a space that's other sort of,

1274
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:02,350
that you create an environment that's 
other than the norm sort of in a way.

1275
00:48:02,351 --> 00:48:05,490
It's kind of hard for me,
it's like non hegemonic.

1276
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:08,270
Um,
but it's um,

1277
00:48:08,690 --> 00:48:11,270
for unusual outside the box space.
Yeah.

1278
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:12,350
Strange environment.

1279
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:13,531
Yeah.
It's kind of a,

1280
00:48:13,531 --> 00:48:15,060
it's kind of a utopia,
but it's a,

1281
00:48:15,061 --> 00:48:18,110
it's a controlled utopia.
It's a Heterotopia like it,

1282
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:20,520
it kind of molds those two ideas.
Okay.

1283
00:48:20,610 --> 00:48:21,443
And like I,
and like I was going to ask you to kind 

1284
00:48:22,801 --> 00:48:23,880
of about podcasting,
stuff like that,

1285
00:48:23,881 --> 00:48:24,714
cause you kind of create one when your 
voice goes out over the air and when 

1286
00:48:27,781 --> 00:48:30,780
you're doing these things,
you're entering into people's heads.

1287
00:48:30,810 --> 00:48:33,000
You yourself in a way or your,
your voices.

1288
00:48:33,001 --> 00:48:35,730
And it's creating this space that's 
other where they're connected with you.

1289
00:48:36,090 --> 00:48:37,380
Right.
And,

1290
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:40,590
um,
it's just an other space and it's,

1291
00:48:40,620 --> 00:48:41,820
and,
and I think that fighting,

1292
00:48:41,821 --> 00:48:44,010
and I think the cage is,
is that as well.

1293
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:45,690
I think it's this,
um,

1294
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:48,240
it's this new avenue,
it's this new area.

1295
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:49,133
And that's where I,
I feel so troubled when it comes to the 

1296
00:48:51,541 --> 00:48:52,374
commercialization of it all because I 
wonder if people are still fighting for 

1297
00:48:55,141 --> 00:48:55,974
Gloria and stuff,
but are they or are they fighting for 

1298
00:48:58,470 --> 00:49:00,090
the pretty pictures?
I don't know.

1299
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:01,770
Like,
and I can't ask people.

1300
00:49:01,771 --> 00:49:04,860
I don't know exactly like I,
I really want the answers to that.

1301
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:07,950
I want to know why people still fight.
I know I did it.

1302
00:49:08,170 --> 00:49:09,003
I think everybody has their own 
different reasons and sometimes those 

1303
00:49:10,661 --> 00:49:11,494
reasons don't serve you well.
Like when Ronda Rousey came back and 

1304
00:49:14,860 --> 00:49:18,220
when she fought Amanda Nunez and all the
lead up was all about Ronda Rousey.

1305
00:49:18,221 --> 00:49:19,054
Yeah.
And it was also about her getting back 

1306
00:49:20,831 --> 00:49:23,170
to being the best in the world.
And I was,

1307
00:49:23,171 --> 00:49:24,004
I was watching all that and it was like,
I'm going to be world champion because 

1308
00:49:26,741 --> 00:49:28,630
fighting is the most important thing.
And I was watching,

1309
00:49:28,631 --> 00:49:29,261
I was like,
wow,

1310
00:49:29,261 --> 00:49:33,190
this all on paper.
You mean I'm keeping my mind open.

1311
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:34,301
Um,
uh,

1312
00:49:34,301 --> 00:49:36,490
I'm excited to see that she's in great 
shape.

1313
00:49:36,491 --> 00:49:37,324
She's coming back fully motivated,
not excited that she hasn't made any 

1314
00:49:40,271 --> 00:49:41,650
changes to our camp,
but,

1315
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:42,700
well,
let's see what happens.

1316
00:49:42,701 --> 00:49:46,780
She's got amazing judo and she was a 
world beater for a real reason,

1317
00:49:46,781 --> 00:49:49,040
but I'm,
all the red flags are there,

1318
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:50,770
although wrong.

1319
00:49:51,180 --> 00:49:51,990
Yes.
Right.

1320
00:49:51,990 --> 00:49:54,720
Nothing about the actual world champion 
who exactly who.

1321
00:49:54,770 --> 00:49:56,360
Yeah,
and it's like an eye.

1322
00:49:56,840 --> 00:50:00,350
I freaking Adore Ronda Rousey and it 
means my teammate,

1323
00:50:00,410 --> 00:50:02,780
like holly is the one who night,
like how did you thrown to her?

1324
00:50:02,990 --> 00:50:03,823
But I,
I adore Rhonda and what she's done and 

1325
00:50:05,331 --> 00:50:06,830
the things that she's done in that 
mentality.

1326
00:50:06,831 --> 00:50:11,831
That's a Diego Sanchez mentality.
Not In the way that cheese she

1327
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:14,133
got used to a very specific thing 
happening when she fought was her 

1328
00:50:17,261 --> 00:50:18,094
dominating.
And when that didn't happen in that one 

1329
00:50:20,321 --> 00:50:20,681
fight,
look,

1330
00:50:20,681 --> 00:50:21,514
she tried her best against holly,
but holly fought the perfect fight and 

1331
00:50:23,621 --> 00:50:25,420
fight.
Ronda fought the wrong fight.

1332
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:26,650
Right.
Absolutely wrong.

1333
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:28,600
The wrong way to fight holly charge at 
her.

1334
00:50:28,670 --> 00:50:29,290
Yeah.
With the,

1335
00:50:29,290 --> 00:50:30,123
yeah.
Yeah.

1336
00:50:30,310 --> 00:50:32,660
I and holly was so ready for that fight.
She was,

1337
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:34,220
she was ready for that fight for years.
Like,

1338
00:50:34,221 --> 00:50:34,630
I can

1339
00:50:34,630 --> 00:50:36,790
see that I could just see in her knee.
She fought perfect.

1340
00:50:36,820 --> 00:50:37,653
Yeah.
I mean it was literally a flawless 

1341
00:50:38,201 --> 00:50:39,270
performance by all.
Yeah.

1342
00:50:39,670 --> 00:50:43,900
So she loses that fight.
She gets devastated and chalks it off to

1343
00:50:43,901 --> 00:50:46,990
lack of training.
Chalks it off to distractions.

1344
00:50:47,110 --> 00:50:50,380
So this time she's going to do no media.
She's going to do no interviews,

1345
00:50:50,381 --> 00:50:53,230
no nothing.
Just go in there and just be bulldog.

1346
00:50:53,231 --> 00:50:54,064
Dot.
But when you,

1347
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:58,840
you see like the discussions about this 
fight and you see,

1348
00:50:58,870 --> 00:51:00,070
uh,
people,

1349
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:01,720
you know that we're there,
we're behind the scenes.

1350
00:51:01,721 --> 00:51:03,730
They were all convinced that she was 
going to steam roll.

1351
00:51:03,731 --> 00:51:05,920
Amanda Nunez.
There was so many people back there.

1352
00:51:05,921 --> 00:51:07,330
I was like,
you guys are out of your fucking mind.

1353
00:51:07,930 --> 00:51:08,763
I was saying before the holly fight,
then Amanda was probably the most 

1354
00:51:10,991 --> 00:51:11,824
dangerous fight for because a man is 
really fucking good on the ground and 

1355
00:51:15,701 --> 00:51:16,534
her standup is vicious.
Like she got brutal knockout power and 

1356
00:51:20,210 --> 00:51:21,820
she's a long,
like she throws,

1357
00:51:21,821 --> 00:51:25,420
he's long ass punches and she catches 
you on the end of these punches.

1358
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:26,583
I'm like,
that's up nightmare for Rhonda because 

1359
00:51:27,791 --> 00:51:30,610
Rhonda likes to stand up and bra to 
close the distance.

1360
00:51:31,030 --> 00:51:33,670
And the name of your close the diseases 
with Amanda Nunez is no picnic.

1361
00:51:33,810 --> 00:51:34,720
No.
And you know,

1362
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:36,930
Amanda's got actually a very good clench
in a very,

1363
00:51:36,931 --> 00:51:37,764
a very good awareness of where her body 
goes and hurt her center of gravity 

1364
00:51:40,351 --> 00:51:41,730
seems to be she's,
you're right.

1365
00:51:41,731 --> 00:51:43,980
She's so long.
It seems to be a little bit lower than,

1366
00:51:43,981 --> 00:51:44,814
you know,
I think it would be very hard to launch 

1367
00:51:46,231 --> 00:51:47,064
her on her head,
although Zingano did very well with the 

1368
00:51:48,780 --> 00:51:51,780
yeah,
belly to belly.

1369
00:51:51,781 --> 00:51:53,130
Suplex that's what that was.
Right.

1370
00:51:53,650 --> 00:51:54,483
I got to remember that

1371
00:51:54,590 --> 00:51:56,840
one other woman who's fucking ferocious 
as hell.

1372
00:51:56,940 --> 00:51:57,773
Cats in Ghana.

1373
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:00,370
So much intensity.
I remember,

1374
00:52:00,371 --> 00:52:02,320
you know,
I first met her in Colorado.

1375
00:52:02,321 --> 00:52:05,230
We were on the same fight show.
It was when I filmed tap out and I tried

1376
00:52:05,231 --> 00:52:07,510
to go say hi to her because Oh,
another female fighter,

1377
00:52:07,511 --> 00:52:08,344
you know,
we weren't fighting each other and she 

1378
00:52:08,651 --> 00:52:10,000
just totally,
and I was like,

1379
00:52:10,030 --> 00:52:10,863
oh,
what a bitch.

1380
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:11,713
Like,
and then I got to know her better and 

1381
00:52:12,741 --> 00:52:14,530
she just like,
she is an amazing person.

1382
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:16,061
She is.
She is.

1383
00:52:16,061 --> 00:52:17,680
She had a fight coming up.
She didn't wanna talk to anybody.

1384
00:52:17,681 --> 00:52:19,410
She didn't want to have,
you know who I was,

1385
00:52:19,570 --> 00:52:21,010
you know,
I didn't know who she was and we weren't

1386
00:52:21,011 --> 00:52:21,844
gonna talk.
And then,

1387
00:52:22,030 --> 00:52:22,863
yeah.
And then I just got to absolutely adore 

1388
00:52:23,621 --> 00:52:24,550
her.
But you know,

1389
00:52:25,390 --> 00:52:27,180
back to Rhonda and all of that,
I,

1390
00:52:27,181 --> 00:52:31,330
I feel like it's interesting,
the Diego Sanchez,

1391
00:52:31,350 --> 00:52:33,880
like kind of the mentality that the bite
down in the third round,

1392
00:52:33,881 --> 00:52:36,400
I think you have something there where 
you pushed when it's against you.

1393
00:52:36,510 --> 00:52:38,500
Yeah.
And I wonder that something that,

1394
00:52:38,530 --> 00:52:41,230
that knockout interrupted her or you 
know,

1395
00:52:41,231 --> 00:52:42,064
when holly got her an interrupted her,
her forward progression and then going 

1396
00:52:44,651 --> 00:52:45,484
back,
pulling back away from the media and 

1397
00:52:46,631 --> 00:52:49,360
stuff,
I almost wonder if that in itself was

1398
00:52:51,150 --> 00:52:54,920
kind of a denial of that interruption 
and maybe uh,

1399
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:57,150
trying to create a space for herself.
I don't know.

1400
00:52:57,151 --> 00:52:57,984
I'm so obsessed with this idea of 
creating our own spaces and what we're 

1401
00:52:59,851 --> 00:53:00,684
doing in our own lives because 
everybody's so different than 

1402
00:53:02,170 --> 00:53:03,420
individual.
Yeah.

1403
00:53:03,421 --> 00:53:04,890
And,
and what she was trying to,

1404
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:05,993
I guess,
plot out the way to this fight and to 

1405
00:53:08,371 --> 00:53:09,204
waive this victory against Amanda Nunez 
and not being distracted and not doing 

1406
00:53:11,251 --> 00:53:13,980
press and stuff like that.
And I almost think if she'd had done the

1407
00:53:13,981 --> 00:53:16,020
press,
and this is just a theory,

1408
00:53:16,021 --> 00:53:17,220
I don't,
I don't know her that well.

1409
00:53:17,221 --> 00:53:21,210
I think she's a lovely person.
But if she had done the of sheet,

1410
00:53:21,211 --> 00:53:22,620
exposed herself to all of that,
again,

1411
00:53:22,621 --> 00:53:23,454
if she wouldn't have had more of a 
triumphant attitude because she would 

1412
00:53:27,971 --> 00:53:32,490
have known.
When you know what it's like to lose and

1413
00:53:32,491 --> 00:53:35,970
you know that you can still get up the 
next day and be okay and,

1414
00:53:36,260 --> 00:53:37,093
and face the people who you said a 
million things to a million confident 

1415
00:53:39,901 --> 00:53:40,734
thanks to and and you're wrong or you 
were wrong for a night and understand 

1416
00:53:45,241 --> 00:53:47,580
that you can actually still get them to 
see your side.

1417
00:53:47,970 --> 00:53:49,110
I don't know if that makes any sense.

1418
00:53:49,230 --> 00:53:50,610
It does.
I see what you're saying.

1419
00:53:50,611 --> 00:53:52,410
I see where you're going with it.
I don't know.

1420
00:53:52,411 --> 00:53:53,244
You know,
I think there's a bunch of problems 

1421
00:53:54,901 --> 00:53:57,850
technically with how she's preparing in 
all.

1422
00:53:57,870 --> 00:54:02,870
I think her work with Edmond made her 
look really good on the mets,

1423
00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:04,133
but there's a big difference between 
looking good on the mats and having a 

1424
00:54:07,561 --> 00:54:11,580
bunch of different options tactically 
when you're in a fight.

1425
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:15,780
And I think a lot of that comes with 
just long,

1426
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:17,273
long sessions in the gym,
a lot of experience and years and years 

1427
00:54:20,281 --> 00:54:21,390
of sparring.
And fighting,

1428
00:54:21,660 --> 00:54:22,493
but she was just go forward,
go forward to tackle forward attack and 

1429
00:54:25,771 --> 00:54:28,140
when she started getting hit,
she didn't have any answers.

1430
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:29,273
She was like throwing up this sort of 
push away front kick and moving away 

1431
00:54:31,981 --> 00:54:32,814
against Amanda and she was kind of done 
from like the first couple of punches 

1432
00:54:35,101 --> 00:54:40,101
landed and I think that if you look at 
real seasoned strikers,

1433
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:44,700
you know like like a good example would 
be,

1434
00:54:44,870 --> 00:54:46,860
oh boy,
there's a lot of good examples,

1435
00:54:46,861 --> 00:54:47,694
but you want to get in j check and a her
last fight against Carolina Kibawe 

1436
00:54:51,750 --> 00:54:52,110
Kovich okay.

1437
00:54:52,110 --> 00:54:57,110
That that is two very seasoned strikers.
There was a lot of like a lot of faints.

1438
00:54:58,230 --> 00:55:01,020
There was a lot of different angles.
There's a lot of different approaches.

1439
00:55:01,021 --> 00:55:03,630
He was try one way that doesn't work.
Let's go over here.

1440
00:55:03,631 --> 00:55:04,464
That doesn't work.
Let's go over here now I've got 

1441
00:55:05,821 --> 00:55:06,990
something.
Let's try that again.

1442
00:55:06,991 --> 00:55:09,240
Went to the well too many times.
Try back to this again.

1443
00:55:09,241 --> 00:55:09,850
There was,
there was,

1444
00:55:09,850 --> 00:55:12,450
it was a communication.
It was like there's a conversation going

1445
00:55:12,451 --> 00:55:13,284
on.
What you're seeing a lot of fighters is 

1446
00:55:15,691 --> 00:55:19,110
they're shouting out one or two words 
but they're not articulate.

1447
00:55:19,350 --> 00:55:20,183
Meaning their approach is very,
if you see someone and they just keep 

1448
00:55:23,101 --> 00:55:24,840
going to the big right hand over the 
top,

1449
00:55:24,841 --> 00:55:25,674
big right hand over the top,
it's like you're just banking on this 

1450
00:55:28,321 --> 00:55:29,154
one thing and someone is going to be 
able to figure out that approach and it 

1451
00:55:32,311 --> 00:55:33,930
might not be the person that's right in 
front of you,

1452
00:55:34,140 --> 00:55:34,973
but someone who's really good is going 
to find their way through that and 

1453
00:55:38,450 --> 00:55:40,180
they're going to be able to talk circles
around you.

1454
00:55:40,180 --> 00:55:41,013
Like I,
I talk all the time about when I watch 

1455
00:55:43,171 --> 00:55:44,580
finding,
I tried to break it down objectively.

1456
00:55:44,581 --> 00:55:45,414
I'm saying what it mirrors in a lot of 
ways is communication and that really 

1457
00:55:49,111 --> 00:55:52,770
truly articulate.
People that have a long list,

1458
00:55:52,771 --> 00:55:53,604
the long history of using a deep 
vocabulary are way better off with a 

1459
00:55:57,421 --> 00:56:00,600
nuanced conversation than someone who is
just,

1460
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:02,370
they might be able to say,
get off my lawn.

1461
00:56:02,371 --> 00:56:03,204
You know,
they might be able to yell out one 

1462
00:56:04,141 --> 00:56:04,974
phrase,
but how can they adapt to someone who's 

1463
00:56:07,381 --> 00:56:10,080
passive?
How can they adapt to someone who tricks

1464
00:56:10,081 --> 00:56:12,450
them?
How can they adapt to someone who paints

1465
00:56:12,451 --> 00:56:15,360
them into a corner and like,
can you figure your way out of a trap?

1466
00:56:15,361 --> 00:56:18,030
Do you understand a trap?
And when you see it in fighting,

1467
00:56:18,210 --> 00:56:20,880
you see people getting set up and you 
see things happening.

1468
00:56:20,881 --> 00:56:21,714
Like Anderson,
like Anderson Silva was a master at 

1469
00:56:24,491 --> 00:56:25,324
setting people up in a master of that.
Like figuring out the language of what 

1470
00:56:28,511 --> 00:56:29,440
you do.
What do you do?

1471
00:56:29,470 --> 00:56:30,303
Like what's your thing?
Like what you could see him when he was 

1472
00:56:31,841 --> 00:56:34,010
moving with guys,
he would stand south Paul,

1473
00:56:34,011 --> 00:56:35,740
he would switch up,
he moved around,

1474
00:56:35,860 --> 00:56:38,050
he would give you a little of this and 
he just tried to Jay.

1475
00:56:38,230 --> 00:56:39,063
And then eventually he'd figure out your
rhythm and then start dropping shit on 

1476
00:56:41,951 --> 00:56:43,570
you.
And when he did,

1477
00:56:43,571 --> 00:56:44,404
it was masterful to watch.
Cause here's a guy that had figured out 

1478
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:50,710
whatever rhythm Yuron he'd figured out 
the symphony of your movements.

1479
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:52,113
Beautiful.
I think it's beautiful and I think that 

1480
00:56:53,470 --> 00:56:54,630
describing that,
uh,

1481
00:56:54,700 --> 00:56:57,070
as a conversation with another person,
it's perfect.

1482
00:56:57,071 --> 00:56:59,010
It is a dialogue between two people.
Yeah,

1483
00:56:59,100 --> 00:56:59,933
it's a dialogue of,
of physicality and strength and stuff 

1484
00:57:01,781 --> 00:57:02,750
like that.
But it's it,

1485
00:57:02,830 --> 00:57:04,780
there's a conversation happening there 
in the cage.

1486
00:57:05,110 --> 00:57:09,340
And I think when we go back to maybe the
aspects of,

1487
00:57:09,790 --> 00:57:13,210
I actually think that Ronda Rousey's 
training might have been a little bit to

1488
00:57:13,211 --> 00:57:14,890
boxing oriented.
Not that she didn't throw kicks,

1489
00:57:14,891 --> 00:57:17,890
not that she didn't use her judo,
but she didn't prepare for chaos.

1490
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:18,753
And I don't know,
the boxers always prepare for chaos 

1491
00:57:20,410 --> 00:57:24,040
because it's such a,
a layered this step,

1492
00:57:24,041 --> 00:57:25,270
you move your,
your foot this way,

1493
00:57:25,271 --> 00:57:27,070
you move your foot this way,
you move your head this way,

1494
00:57:27,071 --> 00:57:28,180
you respond this way.
You know it's,

1495
00:57:28,181 --> 00:57:30,120
it's so beautiful.
But when you see boxers like,

1496
00:57:30,370 --> 00:57:32,620
like Tyson who could throw that double 
right,

1497
00:57:32,621 --> 00:57:33,001
you know,
the,

1498
00:57:33,001 --> 00:57:35,470
the hook to the body and then the upper 
cut and stuff like that.

1499
00:57:35,710 --> 00:57:38,380
He could prepare for the chaos cause he 
couldn't bring chaos.

1500
00:57:38,381 --> 00:57:39,214
And I think that in her early fights 
sheet there was chaos there because she 

1501
00:57:41,441 --> 00:57:43,420
wasn't as sure of herself.
It was,

1502
00:57:43,421 --> 00:57:45,970
wow,
I got to get what I need to get and that

1503
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:47,193
unsettled fighters.
But then when she got more comfortable 

1504
00:57:48,611 --> 00:57:49,444
with hitting the Mitts,
when she got more comfortable with them 

1505
00:57:50,321 --> 00:57:51,154
moving forward and,
and having everything laid out for her 

1506
00:57:53,261 --> 00:57:54,410
perfectly,
you're going to do this,

1507
00:57:54,411 --> 00:57:56,020
you're going to start this person,
this is going to happen.

1508
00:57:56,260 --> 00:57:57,460
Now I'm making a lot of assumptions 
here.

1509
00:57:57,461 --> 00:57:58,650
I never trained with.
Right.

1510
00:57:58,710 --> 00:57:59,820
I never sparred with her.
I,

1511
00:57:59,821 --> 00:58:00,654
I see what I've been presented by UFC 
media and commercials and I do as well 

1512
00:58:04,931 --> 00:58:06,780
as well as people that I know the train 
were there.

1513
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:08,860
Didn't like the environment.
Yeah.

1514
00:58:08,890 --> 00:58:09,723
Dot.
That it was just a little bit to an 

1515
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:12,273
unrealistic and that's I think what 
maybe the conversation between old 

1516
00:58:16,371 --> 00:58:17,204
school emma man,
what's going on in mma right now with 

1517
00:58:18,551 --> 00:58:20,530
commercialization and it's worldwide.

1518
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:22,120
And I,
on one hand,

1519
00:58:22,121 --> 00:58:24,730
I'm so happy for the fighters that 
they're getting paid more that,

1520
00:58:24,731 --> 00:58:26,230
that the opportunities are there,
that,

1521
00:58:26,231 --> 00:58:27,064
you know,
they don't have to worry about crappy 

1522
00:58:27,461 --> 00:58:29,110
sponsors,
although I'm not a huge reebok fan,

1523
00:58:29,111 --> 00:58:30,730
but whatever,
it's not my business like,

1524
00:58:31,030 --> 00:58:32,140
but,
um,

1525
00:58:32,170 --> 00:58:33,003
the,
um,

1526
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:35,110
they don't prepare for chaos anymore as 
much.

1527
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:37,810
And Chaos was what we thrived on back in
the day.

1528
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:38,673
Right?
We didn't know who we were going to 

1529
00:58:39,641 --> 00:58:40,474
fight.
I fought three pill and one in three 

1530
00:58:41,201 --> 00:58:42,034
people in one night.
One time I lost a fight and then the 

1531
00:58:44,620 --> 00:58:46,990
next day I took a kickboxing fight cause
I was so mad I lost an MMA fight.

1532
00:58:46,991 --> 00:58:50,380
Like there was no regulation and I could
have gotten seriously injured.

1533
00:58:50,381 --> 00:58:51,214
Right.
But at the same time it was that chaos 

1534
00:58:53,381 --> 00:58:54,214
that was so beautiful.
Like finding where you are in the chaos 

1535
00:58:56,261 --> 00:58:57,094
and,
and finding your own patterns in that 

1536
00:58:59,030 --> 00:59:00,820
and preparing for it.
And that's,

1537
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:02,433
I don't know,
that's the old school mma that I miss a 

1538
00:59:04,571 --> 00:59:06,470
little bit.
While there's definitely something

1539
00:59:06,780 --> 00:59:08,820
interesting and fascinating about that 
chaos,

1540
00:59:09,090 --> 00:59:12,030
but there's also,
when you're talking about a professional

1541
00:59:12,031 --> 00:59:14,790
and when you're talking about someone 
who's a world champion in particular,

1542
00:59:15,300 --> 00:59:20,300
there's real value in preparation for an
individual opponent,

1543
00:59:20,460 --> 00:59:21,293
right?
And you switch up at opponent last men 

1544
00:59:23,191 --> 00:59:24,024
and or something happens like when conor
mcgregor last minute wasn't facing 

1545
00:59:26,901 --> 00:59:30,230
Hofeld dose on Joe Saul's son who was 
facing Nate Diaz on 11 days notice.

1546
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:32,400
I mean that,
that kind of chaos is,

1547
00:59:32,401 --> 00:59:33,980
is completely different animal.

1548
00:59:34,060 --> 00:59:35,850
I,
I totally agree with you and you know,

1549
00:59:35,851 --> 00:59:38,160
I might be contradicting myself here,
but I don't care.

1550
00:59:38,220 --> 00:59:40,410
Because also when Jon Jones were 
ejected,

1551
00:59:40,420 --> 00:59:41,130
the,
the fight,

1552
00:59:41,130 --> 00:59:41,963
the initial,
like when jail was supposed to step in 

1553
00:59:43,591 --> 00:59:44,520
for him and he said,
no,

1554
00:59:44,700 --> 00:59:45,930
that's not what my team,
you know,

1555
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:49,320
once and he got so much shit for that 
and the whole event got cancelled at the

1556
00:59:49,321 --> 00:59:49,980
same time.
It's just like,

1557
00:59:49,980 --> 00:59:52,140
that's a pretty smart professional move 
to make.

1558
00:59:52,550 --> 00:59:54,410
It is and it isn't,
you know,

1559
00:59:54,411 --> 00:59:57,710
I think John also didn't want to risk 
reward chill sign and for all that shit.

1560
00:59:58,490 --> 00:59:59,323
But my thought is John Jones smokes jail
sign and if you wake them up at five 

1561
01:00:02,241 --> 01:00:03,950
o'clock in the morning after he's been 
out drinking,

1562
01:00:04,220 --> 01:00:04,851
yeah.
I just,

1563
01:00:04,851 --> 01:00:07,120
I just don't think they're in the same 
stratosphere.

1564
01:00:07,220 --> 01:00:08,510
No,
I don't think so either.

1565
01:00:08,570 --> 01:00:10,340
Um,
but I do think that that,

1566
01:00:10,850 --> 01:00:11,683
although it was a move that affected a 
lot of people negatively who were 

1567
01:00:13,731 --> 01:00:16,130
supposed to be on that card and it 
affected the company negatively,

1568
01:00:16,131 --> 01:00:21,131
it was a very big power move and it was 
also a move towards saying,

1569
01:00:21,380 --> 01:00:22,190
hey,
I'm,

1570
01:00:22,190 --> 01:00:24,220
I'm more professional than this.
You can't do that to me.

1571
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:25,340
Yeah,
I agree.

1572
01:00:25,370 --> 01:00:27,200
But if I was in John's corner opposite,
listen to me,

1573
01:00:27,201 --> 01:00:28,470
dude,
you're the motherfuckers.

1574
01:00:28,670 --> 01:00:31,010
All motherfuckers go out there and smash
that dude.

1575
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:34,490
The person who was with the people in 
his corner,

1576
01:00:34,491 --> 01:00:37,010
I would say they're going to do things 
the way they see best for him.

1577
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:37,701
Yeah,
no,

1578
01:00:37,701 --> 01:00:40,970
I get it.
But that's not the rumble Johnson.

1579
01:00:41,030 --> 01:00:42,300
No,
but that's also the way,

1580
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:45,770
that's also the ways,
if you're not prepared specifically,

1581
01:00:45,771 --> 01:00:46,341
like I,
again,

1582
01:00:46,341 --> 01:00:47,720
I'm going back to what I was saying 
about the chaos,

1583
01:00:47,721 --> 01:00:48,554
but you have to train for chaos and you 
do have to be prepared specifically for 

1584
01:00:50,931 --> 01:00:52,160
opponents.
You're very right in that.

1585
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:53,660
You have to know what somebody is going 
to do.

1586
01:00:53,661 --> 01:00:55,370
That's how holly was so successful about
Rhonda.

1587
01:00:55,371 --> 01:00:57,260
She knew every move that was going to 
come her way.

1588
01:00:57,290 --> 01:00:58,123
Right.
And I think that when you switch things 

1589
01:00:59,661 --> 01:01:03,470
up on such a level where it was that big
of a fight,

1590
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:05,300
somebody he'd been preparing for a 
Henderson,

1591
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:06,313
it was Henderson,
right?

1592
01:01:06,650 --> 01:01:07,483
Am I,
John was spinning Henderson and one 57 

1593
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:12,110
I,
there were a lot of fights fighting.

1594
01:01:12,230 --> 01:01:17,230
Who thought it was who had to pull out a
lot of fights.

1595
01:01:18,711 --> 01:01:20,330
I don't know.
I just,

1596
01:01:20,331 --> 01:01:22,430
I know jail came in and it was,
it was a quest guy,

1597
01:01:22,431 --> 01:01:23,900
right?
He's supposed to be Dan Henderson.

1598
01:01:23,901 --> 01:01:25,730
Really thought so.
It was a quest guy.

1599
01:01:25,930 --> 01:01:27,860
Did Dan Henderson and Jones ever fight?
No,

1600
01:01:28,170 --> 01:01:29,370
I'm,
I'm pretty sure it was hundred.

1601
01:01:29,380 --> 01:01:30,710
I could be completely mistaken,
but yeah,

1602
01:01:30,770 --> 01:01:31,603
Dan Henderson did fight Daniel cormier.
Remember that fight and Daniel just 

1603
01:01:34,230 --> 01:01:36,890
sorta ragdoll I'm all over the place.
I don't know.

1604
01:01:36,950 --> 01:01:39,230
I don't remember who the hell John was 
supposed to fight.

1605
01:01:39,350 --> 01:01:40,183
It just seemed as though those are the 
moments where a legacy can be very 

1606
01:01:44,121 --> 01:01:44,954
shaken.
Now John's done his own work of shaking 

1607
01:01:46,671 --> 01:01:50,630
up his own legacy.
John just needs someone to talk to.

1608
01:01:51,560 --> 01:01:52,393
I think that we all make poor choices 
and some people's poor choices are a 

1609
01:01:55,821 --> 01:01:57,260
little bit bigger than other people's 
four choices.

1610
01:01:57,380 --> 01:01:58,213
Well and is also wild.
Motherfuckers do wild motherfucker shit 

1611
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:03,500
like you want some do two opens up with 
Shogun,

1612
01:02:03,501 --> 01:02:06,860
with a flying knee when he's 22 years 
old and catch a Shogun on the chin.

1613
01:02:07,370 --> 01:02:09,080
That's Jon Jones.
And that,

1614
01:02:09,081 --> 01:02:09,914
that whole wild man thing is the reason 
why he's so God damn good in the first 

1615
01:02:13,281 --> 01:02:14,114
place because he has amazing confidence.
What makes John's special is like the 

1616
01:02:18,171 --> 01:02:21,150
Gustafson fight,
a fight that he admittedly was in shitty

1617
01:02:21,151 --> 01:02:22,950
shape for.
It really wasn't training,

1618
01:02:22,951 --> 01:02:25,350
was partying way too much,
wasn't really paying attention,

1619
01:02:25,351 --> 01:02:29,370
didn't think Gustafson can beat him and 
got dragged deep into the fifth round.

1620
01:02:29,371 --> 01:02:31,740
Still wound up winning.
He didn't fold up.

1621
01:02:31,860 --> 01:02:33,270
He fought.
I mean,

1622
01:02:33,271 --> 01:02:36,150
he wound up winning the fifth round.
He winded up taking it to him.

1623
01:02:36,450 --> 01:02:39,110
He pulled that fight out and he made it.
Uh,

1624
01:02:39,150 --> 01:02:39,861
I mean,
look,

1625
01:02:39,861 --> 01:02:43,140
us up sends a bad motherfucker.
It's not like Gustafson was a pushover,

1626
01:02:43,950 --> 01:02:46,500
but John Jones made that fight way 
harder than it was.

1627
01:02:46,501 --> 01:02:47,334
But I'm not being conditioned,
not being in shape and still got it it 

1628
01:02:49,591 --> 01:02:50,200
out in one.
Yeah,

1629
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:51,033
he had that.
I think that that part of him that I 

1630
01:02:53,771 --> 01:02:56,950
hope he returns to that is all about 
that.

1631
01:02:56,980 --> 01:02:58,810
I don't know those Diego Sanchez 
moments,

1632
01:02:58,811 --> 01:02:59,910
like when you just,
it,

1633
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:03,220
it becomes your spirit that's fighting.
They're not just your body.

1634
01:03:03,221 --> 01:03:04,054
That's funny.
But something else has to take over and 

1635
01:03:04,811 --> 01:03:05,630
take the reins

1636
01:03:05,630 --> 01:03:06,463
one,
two or popped his arm and beat the veto 

1637
01:03:08,071 --> 01:03:09,910
or had his arms.
So hyper extended.

1638
01:03:09,930 --> 01:03:11,250
I thought he was going to tab,
I was like,

1639
01:03:11,251 --> 01:03:12,530
holy.
I was hoping I just,

1640
01:03:12,670 --> 01:03:14,250
do you want to see his arm break?
You know what I mean?

1641
01:03:14,251 --> 01:03:15,084
It was fucking nasty.
And which is tow is half torn off in 

1642
01:03:17,321 --> 01:03:18,690
that other,
we didn't know about that.

1643
01:03:19,020 --> 01:03:21,120
He just didn't feel it.
Like that's another level.

1644
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:22,073
Yeah.
He didn't know about that until he was 

1645
01:03:23,101 --> 01:03:23,934
doing the post fight interview and 
looked down and saw his toe and he was 

1646
01:03:26,401 --> 01:03:27,031
like,
Holy Shit.

1647
01:03:27,031 --> 01:03:27,864
And then we got him a stool and he sat 
down on the stool and he was kind of in 

1648
01:03:30,211 --> 01:03:31,110
shock.
Yeah.

1649
01:03:31,660 --> 01:03:33,370
Yeah,
I always called him my little brother at

1650
01:03:33,371 --> 01:03:34,760
the gym,
but I always,

1651
01:03:35,140 --> 01:03:36,430
yeah,
it's been,

1652
01:03:36,460 --> 01:03:37,540
he's not my look,
I guess.

1653
01:03:37,541 --> 01:03:38,920
I haven't been at the gym in a long 
time.

1654
01:03:38,921 --> 01:03:39,510
So

1655
01:03:39,510 --> 01:03:43,470
John is almost too talented for his own 
good and surrounded by the wrong kind of

1656
01:03:43,471 --> 01:03:44,700
people.
I think that he does that.

1657
01:03:44,701 --> 01:03:46,140
Yeah.
I think that he,

1658
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:48,470
there's something about him that self 
sabotages.

1659
01:03:48,550 --> 01:03:49,470
Yeah,
it's easy.

1660
01:03:49,620 --> 01:03:51,390
It's easy to self sabotage,
you know,

1661
01:03:51,410 --> 01:03:54,330
it's like the pressure of being a Jon 
Jones.

1662
01:03:54,690 --> 01:03:57,000
What do you think about the amount of 
money that guy missed out on?

1663
01:03:57,660 --> 01:03:58,441
You know,
and then he's,

1664
01:03:58,441 --> 01:03:59,274
he's coming back in July and he'll most 
likely be fighting the winter of Daniel 

1665
01:04:03,340 --> 01:04:04,380
Cormier.
I Rung Rumble Johnson,

1666
01:04:04,381 --> 01:04:06,780
which is in a couple of months.
If they could do that in time.

1667
01:04:06,781 --> 01:04:08,760
Cause you've,
you've got to go may,

1668
01:04:08,761 --> 01:04:09,421
June,
July,

1669
01:04:09,421 --> 01:04:10,254
maybe.
I mean it really depends on how this 

1670
01:04:11,611 --> 01:04:15,900
fight goes,
but he still has a chance to pull it off

1671
01:04:15,901 --> 01:04:17,940
and still has a chance to be the 
greatest of all time.

1672
01:04:18,570 --> 01:04:23,070
But he's fucked up pretty hard.
I liked John Though.

1673
01:04:23,071 --> 01:04:25,170
I just think John's around the wrong 
fucking people.

1674
01:04:25,360 --> 01:04:27,130
He's a good dude.
I just think that,

1675
01:04:27,131 --> 01:04:28,390
um,
yeah,

1676
01:04:28,700 --> 01:04:29,533
I,
I think that we all wake up at some 

1677
01:04:31,511 --> 01:04:34,240
point and I just think his wakeup hasn't
happened yet.

1678
01:04:34,510 --> 01:04:35,343
Like even with maybe with the 
suspensions and the stuff that he's 

1679
01:04:36,791 --> 01:04:38,830
saying,
but I think that he also tried very hard

1680
01:04:39,730 --> 01:04:42,730
to brand himself a certain way that 
again,

1681
01:04:42,790 --> 01:04:44,830
authenticity and authentic and 
authenticity.

1682
01:04:44,831 --> 01:04:47,000
You know,
like I think that I'm sure that I,

1683
01:04:47,001 --> 01:04:47,834
I'm not a religious person,
so I don't really know how to say if 

1684
01:04:49,781 --> 01:04:52,930
somebody is being Super Christian or not
being Super Christian and being whatever

1685
01:04:52,931 --> 01:04:54,310
that they,
they identify with.

1686
01:04:54,311 --> 01:04:55,270
Like I,
it's not my,

1687
01:04:55,720 --> 01:04:56,553
that's not my knowledge sphere,
but I will say that it didn't seem the 

1688
01:04:59,231 --> 01:05:00,064
things that he was saying didn't jive 
with how he was and it came out and 

1689
01:05:02,741 --> 01:05:03,740
people hated him for it.

1690
01:05:03,870 --> 01:05:04,703
They did get mad at that because he was 
trying to present this goody two shoes 

1691
01:05:07,051 --> 01:05:09,000
image and meanwhile he's a wild man.
Yeah.

1692
01:05:09,001 --> 01:05:09,340
And,
yeah,

1693
01:05:09,340 --> 01:05:10,173
you know,
the wild man is a respected figure in 

1694
01:05:11,740 --> 01:05:12,960
and that made me respect it.
But it's a,

1695
01:05:12,961 --> 01:05:13,794
it's a vulnerable figure in society.
Like Donald Cowboy cerrone is a perfect 

1696
01:05:16,141 --> 01:05:16,974
example.
Yeah.

1697
01:05:16,990 --> 01:05:18,430
Hundred percent on his sleeve.
Wow.

1698
01:05:18,530 --> 01:05:19,363
Yeah.
Yeah.

1699
01:05:19,370 --> 01:05:20,990
I love him.
He's,

1700
01:05:21,020 --> 01:05:22,760
yeah,
and a good dude.

1701
01:05:22,910 --> 01:05:23,750
But yeah,
wild man.

1702
01:05:23,751 --> 01:05:26,300
He has to have those rushes.
He has to have that,

1703
01:05:26,360 --> 01:05:27,620
that danger coming out him,

1704
01:05:27,770 --> 01:05:28,603
uh,
he lives for it genuinely lives for it 

1705
01:05:30,181 --> 01:05:31,410
and without it,
he doesn't feel as,

1706
01:05:31,590 --> 01:05:35,310
as tuned in and doesn't feel as alive.
It's crazy fucking sport.

1707
01:05:35,311 --> 01:05:37,290
Julie.
Kedsey crazy.

1708
01:05:38,080 --> 01:05:40,300
I want to know you.
I want to know about you.

1709
01:05:40,301 --> 01:05:42,190
Who were you when you first started all 
this?

1710
01:05:42,580 --> 01:05:43,250
Who Was it?
Yeah.

1711
01:05:43,250 --> 01:05:44,980
Who were you and are you the same person
now?

1712
01:05:45,880 --> 01:05:47,800
Who are you like?
Well who was Joe Rogan?

1713
01:05:47,830 --> 01:05:48,640
Well,
it's just like,

1714
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:49,473
it's something I'm,
I'm,

1715
01:05:49,750 --> 01:05:52,930
I'm thinking about these heterotopic 
spaces and thinking about authenticity.

1716
01:05:52,931 --> 01:05:54,240
I'm like,
here's a person.

1717
01:05:54,241 --> 01:05:55,720
I was actually just going to email you 
these questions.

1718
01:05:55,721 --> 01:05:56,554
I was like,
oh well if I come in here I can plug 

1719
01:05:57,731 --> 01:06:00,460
invicta and that would be great.
Cause I love plugging in victim,

1720
01:06:00,760 --> 01:06:02,230
but I'm also,
I just,

1721
01:06:02,231 --> 01:06:03,820
I,
I've never really sat down and talked to

1722
01:06:03,821 --> 01:06:07,510
you and I guess who were you when this 
started and who are you now?

1723
01:06:07,511 --> 01:06:08,800
Like are you the same person?
Yeah,

1724
01:06:09,260 --> 01:06:11,330
well I'm not the same person I was six 
months ago.

1725
01:06:11,720 --> 01:06:12,920
I mean that's just,
yeah,

1726
01:06:13,040 --> 01:06:13,873
I would imagine if you're constantly 
thinking about things and constantly 

1727
01:06:17,211 --> 01:06:20,320
growing and trying to reevaluate 
constantly.

1728
01:06:21,180 --> 01:06:21,831
Uh,
yeah,

1729
01:06:21,831 --> 01:06:22,664
I was younger,
I was just a few years removed from 

1730
01:06:24,741 --> 01:06:28,100
martial arts competition and kickboxing 
and was doing some acting and stuff.

1731
01:06:28,310 --> 01:06:29,143
Did you train stand up?
Did you sorta had to take a few acting 

1732
01:06:32,541 --> 01:06:33,374
classes when I got a development deal,
but it was because I already had a 

1733
01:06:35,151 --> 01:06:36,830
television show and so they said,
hey,

1734
01:06:36,831 --> 01:06:39,380
you should learn how to act.
It was really that.

1735
01:06:39,410 --> 01:06:41,300
It wasn't then.
It was something that I trained for.

1736
01:06:41,660 --> 01:06:42,141
No,
I,

1737
01:06:42,141 --> 01:06:42,974
um,
I was doing standup and I got a 

1738
01:06:43,701 --> 01:06:45,110
development deal,
do a sitcom.

1739
01:06:45,310 --> 01:06:48,530
And so then all of a sudden I found 
myself out here and,

1740
01:06:48,531 --> 01:06:49,311
uh,
you know,

1741
01:06:49,311 --> 01:06:51,560
I was like,
when I moved out here,

1742
01:06:51,561 --> 01:06:54,020
I was like 25,
six,

1743
01:06:54,021 --> 01:06:54,854
something like that.

1744
01:06:55,040 --> 01:06:58,030
And I was just trying to figure out what
I'm doing,

1745
01:06:58,031 --> 01:06:59,510
like my,
my acting like this is,

1746
01:06:59,540 --> 01:07:01,190
this whole thing is weird,
you know.

1747
01:07:01,191 --> 01:07:04,490
And then a couple of years later,
I guess it was 97,

1748
01:07:04,491 --> 01:07:07,850
I was training at Carlson Gracie's place
and [inaudible] was 19.

1749
01:07:08,360 --> 01:07:08,871
And,
uh,

1750
01:07:08,871 --> 01:07:11,240
he had just beaten John Hassle over in 
Hawaii.

1751
01:07:11,241 --> 01:07:13,350
I was a white belt over there and,
um,

1752
01:07:13,430 --> 01:07:14,263
Mario Sperry train there and Carlos by 
Hereto and I'm Maria Lowe Bustamonte so 

1753
01:07:18,020 --> 01:07:19,490
watch those guys.
Train was amazing.

1754
01:07:20,120 --> 01:07:22,730
And this was back when no one knew any 
of those guys where,

1755
01:07:23,060 --> 01:07:23,721
you know,
it was,

1756
01:07:23,721 --> 01:07:25,580
it was really,
really interesting.

1757
01:07:25,610 --> 01:07:28,070
It was a really interesting to be a part
of that,

1758
01:07:28,071 --> 01:07:29,870
uh,
original Carlson Gracie,

1759
01:07:30,290 --> 01:07:31,123
uh,
Jim and watch those guys work out 

1760
01:07:33,261 --> 01:07:35,870
together and watch everything.
And so when,

1761
01:07:35,900 --> 01:07:39,470
um,
the UFC needed a post-fight interviewer,

1762
01:07:39,860 --> 01:07:40,693
they had a,
they just had con one of the guys who 

1763
01:07:43,221 --> 01:07:44,054
was one of the producers,
Campbell Mclaren was friends with my 

1764
01:07:45,561 --> 01:07:50,350
manager and they just casually mentioned
it and they brought it up to me and then

1765
01:07:50,390 --> 01:07:51,970
we had a conference call and I was like,
Oh fuck,

1766
01:07:51,971 --> 01:07:52,550
I'll do that.

1767
01:07:52,550 --> 01:07:53,390
Like,
what do you want me to do?

1768
01:07:53,960 --> 01:07:56,240
And so the next thing you knew,
I was flying out to Dothan,

1769
01:07:56,241 --> 01:07:58,190
Alabama on those little propeller 
planes.

1770
01:07:58,191 --> 01:07:59,780
I was interviewing Mark Coleman.
I was like,

1771
01:07:59,781 --> 01:08:02,990
this is crazy.
Watching vidor Belfort's debut.

1772
01:08:03,320 --> 01:08:04,153
Um,
you know,

1773
01:08:04,220 --> 01:08:08,210
it was a fascinating time and to catch 
mma sort of in,

1774
01:08:08,211 --> 01:08:09,044
it's transitioned from being the 
spectacle that it once was just four 

1775
01:08:13,071 --> 01:08:17,080
years prior to becoming a sport.
Like Vitara entered the octagon.

1776
01:08:17,090 --> 01:08:18,830
He had gloves on.
You know,

1777
01:08:18,890 --> 01:08:21,880
Vito used to fight with shoes on 
sometimes and got you were,

1778
01:08:21,890 --> 01:08:25,400
you were still out of glad grab clothes 
back then because I remember this guy,

1779
01:08:25,810 --> 01:08:26,720
uh,
had,

1780
01:08:27,020 --> 01:08:30,320
I forget who a volleyed Ishmael fought,
but uh,

1781
01:08:30,470 --> 01:08:31,303
he literally was grabbing his underwear 
and his pants and giving them this like 

1782
01:08:36,471 --> 01:08:37,304
intense wedgie while they were fighting.
Like his cop was snapping and he was 

1783
01:08:40,341 --> 01:08:41,240
totally legal.

1784
01:08:41,270 --> 01:08:42,110
Yeah,
yeah.

1785
01:08:42,320 --> 01:08:45,650
You didn't have to have gloves the way 
classes were,

1786
01:08:45,710 --> 01:08:47,060
you know,
it was only two weight classes.

1787
01:08:47,061 --> 01:08:49,940
I think back then it was real weird.
It was real,

1788
01:08:49,941 --> 01:08:50,774
it was weird to be there and you know,
it was interesting and I did it for a 

1789
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:57,470
couple of years and then it just doesn't
seem like it was going anywhere.

1790
01:08:57,500 --> 01:08:59,750
It was,
mma was stagnant.

1791
01:08:59,780 --> 01:09:00,613
It was removed from cable.
You could only get it if you had direct 

1792
01:09:02,571 --> 01:09:03,404
TV.
So I did it for two years and then I 

1793
01:09:05,721 --> 01:09:06,554
quit and um,
went back to doing other stuff and just 

1794
01:09:09,831 --> 01:09:11,090
sit calm.
I was on and stuff.

1795
01:09:11,091 --> 01:09:11,924
And then the UFC was purchased by 
[inaudible] and then I became friends 

1796
01:09:15,531 --> 01:09:16,364
with Dana and went to a few shows and 
then next thing you know he asked me to 

1797
01:09:19,461 --> 01:09:21,500
do commentary.
It was one of those weird things where I

1798
01:09:21,501 --> 01:09:22,730
have zero desire to do it.

1799
01:09:23,060 --> 01:09:24,320
I just was talking to him,
I go,

1800
01:09:24,321 --> 01:09:25,520
hey man,
do you know about this guy?

1801
01:09:25,521 --> 01:09:27,320
He's fighting over in Japan.
Do you know about this guy,

1802
01:09:27,680 --> 01:09:29,330
this Russian dude,
do you know about this guy?

1803
01:09:29,331 --> 01:09:30,350
And he'd be like,
no,

1804
01:09:30,360 --> 01:09:31,193
who's,
who are these people you write things 

1805
01:09:31,641 --> 01:09:35,240
down and shit.
Cause I was just balls deep in k one and

1806
01:09:35,250 --> 01:09:36,560
cried and all that.
I was just,

1807
01:09:37,160 --> 01:09:38,960
I was always a huge,
huge fan.

1808
01:09:38,961 --> 01:09:39,794
And I had my friend Brian from Canada 
would send me vhs tapes of all these 

1809
01:09:42,351 --> 01:09:44,510
Japanese shows.
So I would just,

1810
01:09:45,350 --> 01:09:47,510
I was just a massive fan.
The Hook can shoot days.

1811
01:09:47,511 --> 01:09:51,770
I watched all the hook and shoots all 
Jeff Osborne shows and uh,

1812
01:09:51,890 --> 01:09:53,240
you know,
and then somewhere around,

1813
01:09:53,270 --> 01:09:55,670
I guess it was 2002 when I was on fear 
factor,

1814
01:09:55,700 --> 01:09:57,950
they asked me to do commentary.
And then I've been doing it ever since.

1815
01:09:58,580 --> 01:09:59,630
So that's it.
That's it.

1816
01:09:59,860 --> 01:10:00,693
Yeah,
that's it.

1817
01:10:01,050 --> 01:10:03,330
And now,
like do you ever look at your old stuff?

1818
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:05,940
Do you ever consider like your mind 
space then?

1819
01:10:06,570 --> 01:10:10,140
You mean like the old commentary stuff 
or just even think about it.

1820
01:10:10,790 --> 01:10:11,623
Do my best every time I do it,
but honestly what my contribution is is 

1821
01:10:14,241 --> 01:10:16,160
so it's,
it's,

1822
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:20,180
I want to say it's insignificant,
but it's not very important because what

1823
01:10:20,181 --> 01:10:21,014
it is is just me trying to do the best I
can describe what I see in front of me 

1824
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:28,850
to make it as entertaining,
as make it as entertaining as I can,

1825
01:10:28,851 --> 01:10:31,010
but also honor what's happening.

1826
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:33,100
You're a conduit.
You're the person.

1827
01:10:33,101 --> 01:10:33,731
Yeah,
exactly.

1828
01:10:33,731 --> 01:10:35,380
You're,
you're where the flow of information has

1829
01:10:35,381 --> 01:10:36,970
to come through for the average viewer.
Yeah.

1830
01:10:36,971 --> 01:10:38,230
No,
I really admire that about you.

1831
01:10:38,231 --> 01:10:39,064
I'm not trying to suck up,
but your enthusiasm is something I 

1832
01:10:41,201 --> 01:10:44,040
really tried to model myself after.
Like I,

1833
01:10:44,050 --> 01:10:46,270
I,
I think that we have,

1834
01:10:46,450 --> 01:10:48,940
like I'm nowhere near the level of 
commentator that you are,

1835
01:10:48,941 --> 01:10:51,070
but when I hear you get excited about 
stuff,

1836
01:10:51,071 --> 01:10:53,020
I'm really happy to hear that because it
makes me think,

1837
01:10:53,021 --> 01:10:53,854
okay,
as somebody who's communicating what's 

1838
01:10:56,171 --> 01:10:59,710
happening in this sphere that so many 
people know about,

1839
01:10:59,711 --> 01:11:00,544
but so many people don't really 
understand like what's going on if 

1840
01:11:02,231 --> 01:11:03,064
somebody is clenched up or they're 
grabbing a bicep here and why that's 

1841
01:11:05,111 --> 01:11:07,600
important,
why the way this fight or shifting their

1842
01:11:07,601 --> 01:11:09,340
hips is so important.
You know?

1843
01:11:09,341 --> 01:11:09,911
And,
and it's,

1844
01:11:09,911 --> 01:11:13,980
it's cool to see that kind of enthusiasm
so that I

1845
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:14,813
guess other people can get excited about
something without even knowing they're 

1846
01:11:16,501 --> 01:11:17,900
getting excited.
Like they're there.

1847
01:11:18,420 --> 01:11:21,150
The blood pressure comes up a little bit
when they're watching and that's neat.

1848
01:11:21,450 --> 01:11:23,340
It's neat to see that cause it seems 
genuine.

1849
01:11:23,630 --> 01:11:24,463
All a hundred percent genuine.
This is the only sport that I really 

1850
01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:27,830
follow.
I mean,

1851
01:11:27,860 --> 01:11:30,980
I don't really even understand football.
I don't know what's going on.

1852
01:11:31,040 --> 01:11:33,140
Like when the whistle blows or what 
happened.

1853
01:11:33,170 --> 01:11:34,970
I don't know what happened.
And you know,

1854
01:11:34,971 --> 01:11:36,320
people make fun of me all the time for 
that,

1855
01:11:36,321 --> 01:11:37,154
but I'm like,
it's not interesting to me when I'd 

1856
01:11:39,170 --> 01:11:41,030
kickboxing,
boxing,

1857
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:43,040
wrestling,
Jiu Jitsu and mma,

1858
01:11:43,041 --> 01:11:45,050
watching all that takes up plenty of 
time.

1859
01:11:45,080 --> 01:11:47,270
I don't have time for anything else.
I just don't.

1860
01:11:47,450 --> 01:11:49,790
And the consequences just aren't the 
same.

1861
01:11:50,030 --> 01:11:50,651
I mean,
when,

1862
01:11:50,651 --> 01:11:53,510
when I watch a kickboxing match or watch
an MMA fight,

1863
01:11:53,511 --> 01:11:56,870
the consequences are so extreme that I'm
engaged,

1864
01:11:56,871 --> 01:11:58,820
I'm captivated.
And with mma,

1865
01:11:59,810 --> 01:12:00,643
you know,
when I'm watching it and I'm there live 

1866
01:12:02,601 --> 01:12:04,540
and I'm,
I'm cage side and I'm,

1867
01:12:04,541 --> 01:12:08,630
I'm watching all this stuff go down and 
I'm not just watching,

1868
01:12:08,631 --> 01:12:10,370
but I'm also analyzing it.

1869
01:12:10,520 --> 01:12:14,810
So I'm trying to decipher patterns and 
I'm trying,

1870
01:12:14,811 --> 01:12:17,080
I'm data chunking and trying to figure 
out what,

1871
01:12:17,170 --> 01:12:18,003
what could possibly happen,
what am I seeing in my projecting this 

1872
01:12:20,991 --> 01:12:21,824
or am I actually seeing this?
And just trying to be like as empty 

1873
01:12:24,141 --> 01:12:26,780
about it as I can,
but also be so enthusiastic about it.

1874
01:12:27,500 --> 01:12:30,530
And then it's like,
there's moments like,

1875
01:12:30,531 --> 01:12:33,320
uh,
when Darren Elkins beat [inaudible],

1876
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,640
it's just so hard for me not to cry 
inside the octagon.

1877
01:12:37,760 --> 01:12:38,960
It was so hard.
Oh,

1878
01:12:38,961 --> 01:12:39,800
I believe it.
Yeah,

1879
01:12:39,860 --> 01:12:41,080
but I was interviewing that do like,
I'll,

1880
01:12:41,081 --> 01:12:42,620
I'll,
I'll start welling up right now.

1881
01:12:42,621 --> 01:12:45,050
When I was interviewing him after that 
fight,

1882
01:12:45,410 --> 01:12:47,810
I was like,
that guy just emptied out.

1883
01:12:48,330 --> 01:12:51,200
You mean emptied out his whole soul.
I mean,

1884
01:12:51,500 --> 01:12:56,500
he took up fucking beating for two and a
half rounds and didn't give up an inch.

1885
01:12:57,380 --> 01:12:59,450
There was nothing,
there was no quit in him.

1886
01:12:59,480 --> 01:13:00,650
None.
Zero.

1887
01:13:00,920 --> 01:13:01,753
And then filing the third round,
he catches that guy and there's this 

1888
01:13:04,851 --> 01:13:05,684
fucking roar that he did after that 
fight was stopped where he throws his 

1889
01:13:10,251 --> 01:13:13,370
arm back and he's moving around the cage
and screaming.

1890
01:13:13,371 --> 01:13:15,870
He's covered in blood like right there.
Yeah.

1891
01:13:17,990 --> 01:13:19,130
Yeah.
I mean,

1892
01:13:19,970 --> 01:13:23,290
that's one of the purest human moments 
you can ever see it,

1893
01:13:23,291 --> 01:13:24,124
isn't it?
Like,

1894
01:13:24,440 --> 01:13:26,240
like I,
yeah,

1895
01:13:26,330 --> 01:13:27,680
you have to wipe tears off my hours.
Right.

1896
01:13:28,160 --> 01:13:30,920
No,
I totally understand that.

1897
01:13:30,921 --> 01:13:33,500
Like it's amazing.
It's amazing to,

1898
01:13:34,070 --> 01:13:34,903
I guess to see your passion for that and
to see you are able to witness that and 

1899
01:13:37,611 --> 01:13:39,680
you're still able to translate that kind
of passionate people.

1900
01:13:39,810 --> 01:13:43,080
Well if it stops being that to me,
I'm going to stop doing it.

1901
01:13:43,770 --> 01:13:45,960
But that was just last fight.
I mean it doesn't,

1902
01:13:45,961 --> 01:13:48,570
it just did.
Not only is it not stopped,

1903
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:50,610
there's no,
like when the fights are going on,

1904
01:13:50,611 --> 01:13:53,550
there's no waning whatsoever in my 
enthusiasm.

1905
01:13:53,551 --> 01:13:54,480
It's not.
It hasn't,

1906
01:13:54,780 --> 01:13:56,880
it hasn't dissipated and people think 
like,

1907
01:13:56,881 --> 01:13:57,714
oh,
he's kind of half and now because he 

1908
01:13:58,771 --> 01:14:01,830
doesn't do all the events like that.
And that can be further from the truth.

1909
01:14:01,831 --> 01:14:02,790
I just don't want to travel.

1910
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:04,320
No.
And also you're going to,

1911
01:14:04,410 --> 01:14:05,243
you're going to wear yourself down to a 
certain point where it's just like 

1912
01:14:06,601 --> 01:14:07,434
you're going to be too sick to actually 
be able to experience what you need to 

1913
01:14:09,631 --> 01:14:11,980
experience for the viewer to feel what's

1914
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:12,480
going on.

1915
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:14,160
That's awesome.
I have too many interests.

1916
01:14:14,570 --> 01:14:16,920
I do too.
I like to do too many things.

1917
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:17,880
I just,
I just,

1918
01:14:18,480 --> 01:14:20,670
I'm trying to do,
I'm trying to live five lives,

1919
01:14:20,730 --> 01:14:21,563
you know?

1920
01:14:21,880 --> 01:14:22,713
I mean if you have the opportunity to,
why not does it does wear you thin a 

1921
01:14:27,431 --> 01:14:28,264
little bit.
Did you,

1922
01:14:28,420 --> 01:14:30,670
did you have that kind of passionate 
connection with comedy?

1923
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:31,713
Like when,
when you're doing standup and when 

1924
01:14:32,711 --> 01:14:34,730
you're,
when you're in that kind of engagement,

1925
01:14:34,731 --> 01:14:35,564
do you feel that flow where you're just 
almost to the point of emotion and you 

1926
01:14:37,721 --> 01:14:38,490
want to cry?

1927
01:14:38,490 --> 01:14:39,630
No,
not like that.

1928
01:14:39,631 --> 01:14:41,940
That's different because it's a life or 
death.

1929
01:14:42,180 --> 01:14:44,490
Like Dud Darren Elkins fight was life or
death.

1930
01:14:44,940 --> 01:14:46,710
It was a,
it's a different thing.

1931
01:14:46,711 --> 01:14:49,110
It's not,
it's like comedy is fun.

1932
01:14:49,530 --> 01:14:51,810
It's like joyful.
It's silly.

1933
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:52,673
It's important in that I know that 
people come out to see me and they pay 

1934
01:14:55,621 --> 01:14:56,454
money and I want to do my best.
It's important that I'm trying to 

1935
01:14:59,401 --> 01:15:03,510
constantly improve.
What I do is I dump all our material out

1936
01:15:03,511 --> 01:15:05,490
every two years.
So I ride a special,

1937
01:15:06,150 --> 01:15:09,870
I perform it,
I get it tight and then I record it.

1938
01:15:10,230 --> 01:15:12,090
I put it on whatever,
on Netflix or whatever,

1939
01:15:12,091 --> 01:15:13,150
and then I'm done.
And then,

1940
01:15:13,151 --> 01:15:13,984
um,
and then I have to write a whole new 

1941
01:15:14,311 --> 01:15:15,144
one.
And that process is a long and painful 

1942
01:15:16,741 --> 01:15:17,574
process.
Like I did my netflix special in 

1943
01:15:20,281 --> 01:15:21,990
November.
It came out in November,

1944
01:15:21,991 --> 01:15:25,350
so it's been December,
January,

1945
01:15:25,350 --> 01:15:25,380
February,
March.

1946
01:15:25,380 --> 01:15:29,280
We're four months in now.
So it's like on like fon legs.

1947
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:30,593
It's like,
it's just sort of like trotting along 

1948
01:15:32,431 --> 01:15:34,470
now.
It's not really like a cult,

1949
01:15:34,530 --> 01:15:36,660
you know,
it's not really like fully formed yet,

1950
01:15:36,870 --> 01:15:37,703
but it will get fully formed.
And then once it gets hardened and once 

1951
01:15:40,561 --> 01:15:43,350
I know that it's ready to rock,
like I could smash for an hour,

1952
01:15:43,351 --> 01:15:44,184
then I chuck it out.
And so there's a lot of intensity in 

1953
01:15:47,431 --> 01:15:49,710
that regard.
But it's a different kind of intensity.

1954
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:50,970
Like the,
the kind of,

1955
01:15:51,060 --> 01:15:52,620
it's a fun intensity.
There's a,

1956
01:15:52,621 --> 01:15:54,750
there's a motion.
It's like there's,

1957
01:15:54,910 --> 01:15:55,743
you know,
jokes that don't go well and it's 

1958
01:15:57,091 --> 01:15:57,924
painful and I don't enjoy that.
But I also know that that's where the 

1959
01:16:00,871 --> 01:16:03,330
growth comes from.
Like those shitty sets or with like some

1960
01:16:03,331 --> 01:16:07,770
of my biggest leaps have come from af 
posts sets where it wasn't good.

1961
01:16:07,890 --> 01:16:10,830
And then I was sort of reengage and 
reconnect and it got more fired up.

1962
01:16:11,070 --> 01:16:12,750
And as soon as that stops being 
important to me,

1963
01:16:12,751 --> 01:16:13,584
I'll stop doing that too.
But it doesn't have the same feeling 

1964
01:16:16,381 --> 01:16:17,670
that fighting has fighting is,
has,

1965
01:16:17,671 --> 01:16:20,340
is unique,
unique moment.

1966
01:16:20,520 --> 01:16:24,840
This unique thing to it.
Like that Darren Elkins fight where it's

1967
01:16:24,841 --> 01:16:25,440
like,
man,

1968
01:16:25,440 --> 01:16:29,220
there's not a whole lot of things like 
that in the world that you can witness.

1969
01:16:29,540 --> 01:16:30,373
Where did that fucking intense and that 
I have the honor to try to do service 

1970
01:16:35,611 --> 01:16:36,600
to,
to try to,

1971
01:16:36,860 --> 01:16:37,693
I would say fighting is one of the few 
arts or sports or however you wanna 

1972
01:16:41,420 --> 01:16:42,253
phrase it.
Experiences in the world where the 

1973
01:16:42,771 --> 01:16:46,340
stakes are immediately,
hi there laid out there.

1974
01:16:46,341 --> 01:16:47,174
The stakes are high.
You win or lose isn't just win or lose 

1975
01:16:49,441 --> 01:16:51,890
to a fighter and it's not win or lose to
a fan.

1976
01:16:51,891 --> 01:16:54,020
Although you can step back and say that 
or you can say,

1977
01:16:54,021 --> 01:16:55,240
well,
I'm just watching this for energy,

1978
01:16:55,241 --> 01:16:58,640
but you get invested.
It gets so invested in it.

1979
01:16:58,670 --> 01:17:00,800
I think that's,
I was kind of a lousy matchmaker in that

1980
01:17:00,801 --> 01:17:02,990
sense that I cared about the girls too 
much.

1981
01:17:03,380 --> 01:17:04,213
I really did and I was just like,
I didn't want anybody to lose ever and 

1982
01:17:06,560 --> 01:17:07,450
it's was just like,
you know,

1983
01:17:07,451 --> 01:17:10,280
I was [inaudible] it was terrible.
With the math

1984
01:17:10,280 --> 01:17:10,971
and the Oregon.
I'm just,

1985
01:17:10,971 --> 01:17:11,880
I'm a very,

1986
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:18,120
very hyperactive,
like not when I'm in the zone,

1987
01:17:18,121 --> 01:17:19,800
I can pay attention really well,
but when I'm not,

1988
01:17:19,801 --> 01:17:21,750
it's I'm,
my mind is everywhere and I can't really

1989
01:17:21,751 --> 01:17:24,660
focus and I wasn't,
I wasn't great in that respect.

1990
01:17:25,060 --> 01:17:26,820
Um,
but man,

1991
01:17:27,330 --> 01:17:28,950
when you see something come together 
though,

1992
01:17:28,951 --> 01:17:29,784
when you see the fight actually happen 
and it does matter who wins or who 

1993
01:17:32,911 --> 01:17:34,650
loses.
But it also doesn't,

1994
01:17:34,651 --> 01:17:35,484
what matters is just watching that 
physical engagement and these people 

1995
01:17:37,831 --> 01:17:41,610
perform at their not performing,
but they are performing.

1996
01:17:41,670 --> 01:17:42,870
Yes.
It's,

1997
01:17:43,110 --> 01:17:44,730
I don't know,
it's a cat is an art.

1998
01:17:45,190 --> 01:17:47,090
You know,
like when Meryl Streep was saying that,

1999
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:48,890
yeah,
my may is not the arts.

2000
01:17:49,400 --> 01:17:50,960
Well listen,
it's not painting,

2001
01:17:50,990 --> 01:17:53,180
but guess what?
It's art.

2002
01:17:53,200 --> 01:17:53,410
Yeah.

2003
01:17:53,410 --> 01:17:54,980
It's on a damn canvas.
Like,

2004
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,490
I mean really it is like,
it is,

2005
01:17:57,491 --> 01:17:58,990
I mean it's,
it's a contained,

2006
01:18:00,250 --> 01:18:01,950
these actions are being performed.
It's hard.

2007
01:18:01,980 --> 01:18:03,770
It just,
it may not be what

2008
01:18:03,840 --> 01:18:04,673
we identify as art,
but neither is the person in the modern 

2009
01:18:07,651 --> 01:18:09,870
art with the TV or whatever you were 
talking about earlier.

2010
01:18:09,871 --> 01:18:10,704
Like,
wow,

2011
01:18:11,140 --> 01:18:14,890
you see a fight like me should tape 
versus Holly Holm.

2012
01:18:15,100 --> 01:18:15,933
When Misha take takes holly home down in
the fifth round locks that choke in and 

2013
01:18:20,681 --> 01:18:23,980
holly doesn't even tab,
she's throwing punches in the air as she

2014
01:18:23,981 --> 01:18:26,470
goes on conscious and you know,
there's people on the outside,

2015
01:18:26,471 --> 01:18:27,610
they would look at that and go,
oh,

2016
01:18:27,611 --> 01:18:29,710
that's just barbaric and it's just 
violent.

2017
01:18:30,040 --> 01:18:30,873
But you see Misha tate getting that belt
strapped around her waist and her 

2018
01:18:34,481 --> 01:18:35,314
reaction,

2019
01:18:35,350 --> 01:18:36,970
oh my gosh.
They the her whole life,

2020
01:18:36,971 --> 01:18:37,940
she was the strike force team.

2021
01:18:38,530 --> 01:18:39,970
Rosie came,
yeah.

2022
01:18:40,140 --> 01:18:44,130
You bantamweight champion other wow.
Yeah,

2023
01:18:44,140 --> 01:18:46,020
she was climbed.
She summited the highest

2024
01:18:46,040 --> 01:18:47,810
mountain that she could summit in that 
time.

2025
01:18:47,980 --> 01:18:48,890
It was hard.
Yeah.

2026
01:18:48,990 --> 01:18:50,910
There was art.
The way I described mma,

2027
01:18:50,911 --> 01:18:53,700
my,
my definition is it's high level problem

2028
01:18:53,701 --> 01:18:57,240
solving with dire physical consequences 
and that's really what it is.

2029
01:18:57,241 --> 01:19:02,190
But it's also done in an like,
especially when you watch Anderson fight

2030
01:19:02,191 --> 01:19:03,530
in his prime.
It was beautiful.

2031
01:19:03,750 --> 01:19:04,583
It was beautiful to watch.
Like there was a statics involved that 

2032
01:19:07,891 --> 01:19:10,380
were undeniably artistic.
It was just,

2033
01:19:10,420 --> 01:19:11,760
there's a lesson going on

2034
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:15,030
fight and I can't recall it right now 
where he mimicked all of these different

2035
01:19:15,031 --> 01:19:15,864
styles and like he did it a cup of water
move and then he did this and he was at 

2036
01:19:18,631 --> 01:19:21,180
like all in one fight.
Like he was monkeying around.

2037
01:19:21,181 --> 01:19:22,860
I should,
I don't mean that in,

2038
01:19:23,070 --> 01:19:24,690
I guess that sounds racist and I don't 
mean that.

2039
01:19:24,691 --> 01:19:25,060
I mean,
yeah,

2040
01:19:25,060 --> 01:19:26,980
in the playful sentences or whatever.
Ridiculous.

2041
01:19:26,981 --> 01:19:27,814
Where are we live in?
I can't say monkey and around if it's a 

2042
01:19:29,321 --> 01:19:30,310
black guy.
Well I,

2043
01:19:30,311 --> 01:19:34,590
I mean I want to respect if something 
that I say offend somebody,

2044
01:19:34,610 --> 01:19:36,840
I want to respect their angle of 
offense.

2045
01:19:36,970 --> 01:19:38,350
He didn't mean anything.
I didn't,

2046
01:19:38,351 --> 01:19:40,360
but I in the sense to convey in term.
Yeah.

2047
01:19:40,361 --> 01:19:41,230
And,
and when,

2048
01:19:41,290 --> 01:19:43,360
when he's playing around like that,
I guess when he's,

2049
01:19:43,570 --> 01:19:45,250
when he's mimicking other things and 
you're just like,

2050
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:48,850
this is a fight and you're able to just 
play a completely different game.

2051
01:19:49,140 --> 01:19:51,220
Well he was also part of his strategy

2052
01:19:51,250 --> 01:19:52,083
g and that's what,
what sort of turned against him and 

2053
01:19:53,981 --> 01:19:55,080
Chris Weidman fine.
Yeah.

2054
01:19:55,340 --> 01:19:58,150
Cause that playing around sort of,
it was

2055
01:19:59,040 --> 01:20:01,680
walk your danger,
you know,

2056
01:20:01,790 --> 01:20:04,320
like,
I'm sorry I talking over you.

2057
01:20:04,650 --> 01:20:05,250
No,
please go ahead.

2058
01:20:05,250 --> 01:20:06,083
Oh,
the Nick Diaz did it back then when he 

2059
01:20:07,171 --> 01:20:08,004
laid down.

2060
01:20:08,250 --> 01:20:09,083
I loved that.
That was one of my favorite moments in 

2061
01:20:10,591 --> 01:20:13,350
any fight and it wasn't even anybody 
getting hit Nicolaes down.

2062
01:20:13,351 --> 01:20:14,520
He puts his hands together.
I know.

2063
01:20:14,690 --> 01:20:17,940
He was like Anderson to Anderson.
He played,

2064
01:20:18,510 --> 01:20:19,343
he played,
he played the game and it was like 

2065
01:20:20,461 --> 01:20:21,960
amazing nicus.
Incredible.

2066
01:20:21,990 --> 01:20:25,680
Well next starts talking shit to you.
I think frank shamrock set a pass.

2067
01:20:25,690 --> 01:20:27,390
He's like,
you can't believe it's happening.

2068
01:20:27,570 --> 01:20:29,460
You know,
I can't believe this guy beating my ass.

2069
01:20:29,490 --> 01:20:30,323
And he's talking shit to me.
I mean I remember when he fought Robbie 

2070
01:20:36,451 --> 01:20:37,284
lawler and he was just constantly 
talking shit to him while he was 

2071
01:20:39,391 --> 01:20:40,920
fighting.
You could see like Robbie was like,

2072
01:20:40,921 --> 01:20:41,754
what is going on here?
I give fucks with their heads in 

2073
01:20:44,491 --> 01:20:46,080
people's heads.
It's the complete,

2074
01:20:47,450 --> 01:20:49,190
that's the bench go.
Hey Gosh,

2075
01:20:49,200 --> 01:20:50,033
I know,
right?

2076
01:20:50,650 --> 01:20:52,160
Oh batch you have.
No,

2077
01:20:52,161 --> 01:20:56,600
but it's the complete,
like he's lying down ones.

2078
01:20:57,780 --> 01:20:58,980
He's chilling.
How has,

2079
01:20:58,981 --> 01:20:59,850
I mean,
come on.

2080
01:20:59,860 --> 01:21:00,693
That's one of the funniest moments in 
the history of fighting it is those are 

2081
01:21:03,301 --> 01:21:04,134
the moments when you're just like,
this is somebody who doesn't give a 

2082
01:21:06,721 --> 01:21:07,554
fuck.
Well he was also trying to get Anderson 

2083
01:21:08,761 --> 01:21:09,594
to engage in Anderson.
The whole thing with Anderson was 

2084
01:21:11,581 --> 01:21:12,414
counter striking [inaudible] Patrick 
[inaudible] sort of expose that and a 

2085
01:21:14,311 --> 01:21:16,230
lot of ways,
cause Patrick Otay didn't lead,

2086
01:21:16,530 --> 01:21:19,080
he just waited on Anderson and Anderson 
was like,

2087
01:21:19,081 --> 01:21:20,700
I don't like this.
Yeah,

2088
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:21,440
yeah.

2089
01:21:21,440 --> 01:21:23,260
You cause yeah,
counter striker is,

2090
01:21:23,270 --> 01:21:23,980
um,
they,

2091
01:21:23,980 --> 01:21:26,930
they have their own,
I guess their own methodology with being

2092
01:21:26,931 --> 01:21:29,600
able to read what's happening and if 
somebody doesn't initiate,

2093
01:21:29,601 --> 01:21:31,520
there's a lot of waiting.
Yeah.

2094
01:21:31,970 --> 01:21:33,500
And waiting is,
you know,

2095
01:21:33,501 --> 01:21:34,334
it makes the fans hate you and it makes 
you hate yourself because you get more 

2096
01:21:35,991 --> 01:21:37,090
frustrating.
You're saying your,

2097
01:21:37,190 --> 01:21:39,230
your emotions get more intense.
Right?

2098
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:40,353
Yeah.
It's,

2099
01:21:40,480 --> 01:21:41,313
especially when you get to a fight like 
wonderboy thompson versus Tyron Woodley 

2100
01:21:44,441 --> 01:21:48,250
where you see this waiting thing and 
it's just going on and on and on and you

2101
01:21:48,251 --> 01:21:50,400
know,
five rounds and you're like,

2102
01:21:50,510 --> 01:21:52,260
yeah,
it's not

2103
01:21:53,020 --> 01:21:53,920
fan friendly.
Right.

2104
01:21:53,921 --> 01:21:54,754
But for the fighters,
any wrong move at that point and that 

2105
01:21:57,431 --> 01:21:59,710
waiting game like that could be death.

2106
01:21:59,820 --> 01:22:00,880
Yes.
You know,

2107
01:22:00,990 --> 01:22:03,900
loss loss for sure.
For sure.

2108
01:22:04,770 --> 01:22:05,603
Um,
what excites you now that you're not 

2109
01:22:07,381 --> 01:22:08,360
fighting?
Like what?

2110
01:22:08,370 --> 01:22:09,450
What excites you about this

2111
01:22:09,540 --> 01:22:10,950
or oh,
the sport.

2112
01:22:10,951 --> 01:22:13,560
It's the stories.
I'm a sucker for the stories.

2113
01:22:13,561 --> 01:22:16,200
The whole reason I went back to school 
as I was reading some of those long from

2114
01:22:16,210 --> 01:22:19,140
essays Ama may writers were doing.
And I was like,

2115
01:22:19,260 --> 01:22:20,550
you know what?
I was doing the matchmaking,

2116
01:22:20,551 --> 01:22:22,830
it was doing okay at it.
I was doing the commentary,

2117
01:22:22,831 --> 01:22:23,664
but I was like,
I'm just not reaching that thing that I 

2118
01:22:26,701 --> 01:22:27,534
was reaching when I was fighting.
Something about me is not being 

2119
01:22:28,981 --> 01:22:29,970
expressed.
So I,

2120
01:22:30,600 --> 01:22:32,550
I took a class,
a writing class,

2121
01:22:32,640 --> 01:22:36,090
wrote an essay and um,
it got me into school and I was like,

2122
01:22:36,091 --> 01:22:36,750
and I mean,
I wa,

2123
01:22:36,750 --> 01:22:39,270
I mean it's like one of the best schools
for writing.

2124
01:22:39,350 --> 01:22:40,380
I aware.
Where does two things,

2125
01:22:40,381 --> 01:22:41,214
well,
wrestling and writing and so you get in 

2126
01:22:42,271 --> 01:22:43,104
there.
Yeah.

2127
01:22:43,110 --> 01:22:44,370
Was,
I was just so,

2128
01:22:45,330 --> 01:22:46,860
and I feel alive now.
Like,

2129
01:22:46,861 --> 01:22:47,694
I feel like I'm,
I'm back where I'm back to being the 

2130
01:22:49,141 --> 01:22:49,974
Julie.
I need to be where I'm hungry for 

2131
01:22:51,211 --> 01:22:53,100
something again.
And it's words and stories.

2132
01:22:53,101 --> 01:22:56,480
And I think that MMA is the perfect,
I dunno,

2133
01:22:56,490 --> 01:22:58,950
avenue for all of these stories because 
you know,

2134
01:22:58,951 --> 01:22:59,784
everybody at first in old interviews,
people would just say whatever the fuck 

2135
01:23:03,811 --> 01:23:05,590
they wanted to say and they do whatever 
the fuck they want to do.

2136
01:23:05,591 --> 01:23:06,040
And then everybody

2137
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:07,600
got savvy to this,
the media,

2138
01:23:07,601 --> 01:23:08,201
right?
And they're just like,

2139
01:23:08,201 --> 01:23:10,300
I'm only going to reveal this.
I'm only gonna reveal this.

2140
01:23:10,350 --> 01:23:11,183
Right.
And other people played on that and 

2141
01:23:11,891 --> 01:23:13,150
they're like,
I'm going to give more information,

2142
01:23:13,151 --> 01:23:13,984
I'm going to give soundbites.
And so I think that when it comes to 

2143
01:23:15,791 --> 01:23:18,910
communication and words in mma and what 
fighters are giving,

2144
01:23:19,310 --> 01:23:20,143
um,
there's a lot about what's not being 

2145
01:23:21,221 --> 01:23:22,054
said that can really be explored.
And I'd really like to know what that 

2146
01:23:24,311 --> 01:23:25,144
is.
I want to know what makes a fighter 

2147
01:23:27,711 --> 01:23:29,350
note,
what makes a fighter decided to fight.

2148
01:23:29,860 --> 01:23:33,340
But what makes a fighter decided to wake
up the next day after a fight?

2149
01:23:34,020 --> 01:23:34,751
I,
I,

2150
01:23:34,751 --> 01:23:36,580
you know,
decide to wake up when,

2151
01:23:36,581 --> 01:23:37,301
yeah,
I mean,

2152
01:23:37,301 --> 01:23:39,070
it's so emotional.
It's so crazy.

2153
01:23:39,140 --> 01:23:42,940
And fighters are such insane people that
after a loss,

2154
01:23:42,970 --> 01:23:43,803
I'm surprised actually there aren't more
suicides and stuff like that in this 

2155
01:23:45,871 --> 01:23:46,150
sport.

2156
01:23:46,150 --> 01:23:47,140
And I don't mean to get more,
oh,

2157
01:23:47,240 --> 01:23:48,073
super serious.
But people's take it to such a high 

2158
01:23:49,181 --> 01:23:52,180
level and,
and with the amount of,

2159
01:23:52,181 --> 01:23:55,150
of pain that they invest in themselves 
and the amount of emotion towards it,

2160
01:23:55,390 --> 01:23:58,240
when fighters decide,
I lost this fight and I lost this fight,

2161
01:23:58,241 --> 01:24:00,070
but I'm going to get back in,
I'm going to do it again.

2162
01:24:00,700 --> 01:24:03,430
Like if they decide they make the 
conscious choice to stay,

2163
01:24:03,790 --> 01:24:07,210
not necessarily,
I don't know if it's living in the sense

2164
01:24:07,211 --> 01:24:08,044
of biologically living or just living in
that space still of wanting to be a 

2165
01:24:10,451 --> 01:24:11,860
fighter of wanting to do that.
Some people,

2166
01:24:12,010 --> 01:24:12,850
oh,
it's all I know.

2167
01:24:13,060 --> 01:24:14,740
All I know I've,
all I've ever known is fighting.

2168
01:24:15,400 --> 01:24:17,200
So when the fighting is over,
what do you do?

2169
01:24:17,320 --> 01:24:18,153
What do they do?
And I was just talking to him favor 

2170
01:24:20,570 --> 01:24:21,403
about that.
But I think that he's a real good role 

2171
01:24:22,991 --> 01:24:23,824
model to young fighters cause he's as 
enthusiastic as about his post fight 

2172
01:24:28,211 --> 01:24:29,044
career.

2173
01:24:29,340 --> 01:24:29,831
He's like,
Hey,

2174
01:24:29,831 --> 01:24:32,020
this is a new chapter of my life and I'm
excited.

2175
01:24:32,050 --> 01:24:34,780
I'm excited to do different things now.
I went out with a win,

2176
01:24:35,230 --> 01:24:37,120
you know,
and I love the fact that he did that.

2177
01:24:37,121 --> 01:24:37,954
He fought in Sacramento in his hometown 
and gets a tough guy and Brad Pickett 

2178
01:24:41,350 --> 01:24:42,183
beats brad and he's like,
I'm going to go out with a win and I'm 

2179
01:24:44,590 --> 01:24:46,690
onto the next chapter.
Thank you all so much.

2180
01:24:46,691 --> 01:24:49,570
And he gets his giant round of applause 
and good for him.

2181
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:50,940
Yeah,
he came from a place of,

2182
01:24:50,941 --> 01:24:52,660
um,
I guess of,

2183
01:24:53,290 --> 01:24:56,980
Oh I think privilege is the wrong word 
because he built what he built.

2184
01:24:57,150 --> 01:24:57,983
It does not privilege,
but maybe he came from a place of being 

2185
01:24:59,321 --> 01:25:02,230
able to see a bigger picture.
But then you think about lane,

2186
01:25:02,231 --> 01:25:03,064
be the Joe Frazier's of the sport or 
anything like that when they stopped 

2187
01:25:05,021 --> 01:25:05,470
fighting.

2188
01:25:05,470 --> 01:25:06,540
What,
you know,

2189
01:25:06,710 --> 01:25:08,200
he built a gym,
he did this,

2190
01:25:08,201 --> 01:25:09,370
he did that.
But like what,

2191
01:25:09,970 --> 01:25:12,670
I don't know,
fighter stories to me are incredible.

2192
01:25:12,671 --> 01:25:15,400
The reasons that people fight and the 
reasons that commentators commentate,

2193
01:25:15,401 --> 01:25:16,234
the reasons that people are still so 
emotionally invested in this sport and 

2194
01:25:19,391 --> 01:25:21,670
what those stories are and what keeps 
people going.

2195
01:25:21,970 --> 01:25:22,803
I love that.
I think that there's something to the 

2196
01:25:24,581 --> 01:25:29,320
creation we have built.
I mean the fertittas and Dana built like

2197
01:25:29,321 --> 01:25:31,360
the UFC,
but I mean we as fighters,

2198
01:25:31,361 --> 01:25:32,194
as a fighter community,
as mma community have built something 

2199
01:25:33,761 --> 01:25:38,761
incredible and,
and I am interested in why we still want

2200
01:25:38,891 --> 01:25:41,140
to occupy this space or what makes 
people want to leave it,

2201
01:25:41,141 --> 01:25:41,974
but then come back and maybe that's just
my own personal journey because I can't 

2202
01:25:45,040 --> 01:25:46,180
get out of it.
I can't,

2203
01:25:46,210 --> 01:25:47,043
I can't quit mma.
It has been the greatest love of 10 I 

2204
01:25:51,831 --> 01:25:53,860
mean the life going down to level four.

2205
01:25:53,860 --> 01:25:54,880
It's like,
yeah,

2206
01:25:54,881 --> 01:25:57,070
you can't mimic the intensity.
You can't,

2207
01:25:57,100 --> 01:25:59,560
and I'm finding in words and in,
in communication,

2208
01:25:59,561 --> 01:26:01,510
I'm finding something there.
I'm finding that I can,

2209
01:26:01,540 --> 01:26:02,950
I can access this.
Again,

2210
01:26:03,470 --> 01:26:05,660
it's harder for me because I have to use
my brain work,

2211
01:26:05,960 --> 01:26:08,650
but I can't just go in there kicking and
punching.

2212
01:26:08,670 --> 01:26:10,190
Like I have to like sit and think about 
things.

2213
01:26:10,191 --> 01:26:13,070
I have to formulate these questions for 
life that I've never even thought about.

2214
01:26:13,400 --> 01:26:15,240
But you got to love the questions like 
real case side,

2215
01:26:15,260 --> 01:26:17,120
you know what I mean?
The questions are what's important,

2216
01:26:17,121 --> 01:26:19,760
not even the answers.
It's just finding the right questions to

2217
01:26:19,761 --> 01:26:21,080
ask him.
Going through that.

2218
01:26:21,081 --> 01:26:26,081
And I've really rediscovered a love for 
this sport by stepping away from it.

2219
01:26:26,510 --> 01:26:28,760
Um,
every commentary job that I do now,

2220
01:26:28,790 --> 01:26:30,530
every time I'm in there for Invicta,
I'm just,

2221
01:26:31,040 --> 01:26:31,880
this is amazing.

2222
01:26:32,230 --> 01:26:34,210
And,
and finding that enthusiasm and again,

2223
01:26:34,211 --> 01:26:35,420
as is,
it's great.

2224
01:26:35,421 --> 01:26:37,100
I didn't have that towards the end of my
fight career.

2225
01:26:37,550 --> 01:26:39,560
I was in the UFC because that was the 
dream.

2226
01:26:39,561 --> 01:26:41,420
I had to be in the UFC.
Why does an Invicta,

2227
01:26:41,421 --> 01:26:43,160
how ring card boys?
Um,

2228
01:26:43,190 --> 01:26:46,070
Shannon thinks that's kind of 
disrespectful to boys.

2229
01:26:46,280 --> 01:26:47,113
No,
I think that she makes it more of a 

2230
01:26:47,541 --> 01:26:48,374
spectacle.
So plus these are employees and I think 

2231
01:26:50,721 --> 01:26:51,554
it's a spectacle for girls too.
I have my own opinions about all of 

2232
01:26:52,911 --> 01:26:53,744
that,
like the male gaze and mma and stuff 

2233
01:26:54,531 --> 01:26:56,000
like that.
But the male gaze,

2234
01:26:56,180 --> 01:26:57,340
the male gaze.
Yeah.

2235
01:26:57,350 --> 01:26:59,900
Well it's just eats,
I mean we are formulated to see things,

2236
01:26:59,901 --> 01:27:00,734
I mean ring card girls or tradition that
have come over from boxing and stuff 

2237
01:27:02,631 --> 01:27:04,280
like that.
And it's never been questioned.

2238
01:27:04,610 --> 01:27:05,211
Why,
you know,

2239
01:27:05,211 --> 01:27:05,760
it's like,
well,

2240
01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:06,620
why do we still have this?

2241
01:27:06,620 --> 01:27:10,520
I mean we can put up the ring number 
nine a a jumbo tron.

2242
01:27:10,600 --> 01:27:11,181
Yeah.
And same time,

2243
01:27:11,181 --> 01:27:12,680
I don't want these women to lose their 
jobs.

2244
01:27:12,681 --> 01:27:13,514
I mean they're,
they're part of the brand and the 

2245
01:27:14,751 --> 01:27:16,930
promotional aspect of it.
But in the marine corps,

2246
01:27:16,931 --> 01:27:17,764
girls for Invicta,
we call them the phoenix girls and 

2247
01:27:19,521 --> 01:27:20,354
they're actually,
I mean an Natasha Kingsbury's like a 

2248
01:27:21,261 --> 01:27:22,130
professional runner.
Like,

2249
01:27:22,131 --> 01:27:23,710
I mean,
they're serious high level like there,

2250
01:27:23,930 --> 01:27:25,960
you know,
she used to be ring card girl for the,

2251
01:27:26,210 --> 01:27:29,130
yeah,
she's so great and she's very yoga mind.

2252
01:27:30,310 --> 01:27:31,880
He's really cool.
He's really cool.

2253
01:27:31,910 --> 01:27:33,200
Yeah.
So,

2254
01:27:33,260 --> 01:27:34,011
um,
but no,

2255
01:27:34,011 --> 01:27:39,011
I think that Shannon doesn't want that.
I guess that spectacle illness,

2256
01:27:40,010 --> 01:27:40,843
although I would,
I would argue that the ring girls are 

2257
01:27:41,991 --> 01:27:44,810
spectacle in in that self,
but I don't know.

2258
01:27:44,811 --> 01:27:46,310
I really liked,
I really liked them.

2259
01:27:46,400 --> 01:27:48,340
Like the girls that worked for us,
the women who worked for us.

2260
01:27:48,341 --> 01:27:48,610
Yeah,

2261
01:27:48,610 --> 01:27:49,443
really odd isn't it that there's like 
female ring card girls and an all 

2262
01:27:52,601 --> 01:27:53,434
female?
Like what if we had ring card boys in 

2263
01:27:55,751 --> 01:27:56,584
the UFC for all the men fights.
Who'd be really weird if guys are 

2264
01:27:59,201 --> 01:28:01,570
walking around with Speedos,
with high top

2265
01:28:01,760 --> 01:28:02,593
box.
If we think about seeing that for the 

2266
01:28:05,151 --> 01:28:05,984
first time,
can visually picture that right now 

2267
01:28:06,891 --> 01:28:08,090
because we're not used to it.
Yeah,

2268
01:28:08,091 --> 01:28:08,924
it would be weird,
but I mean if it was the norm then I 

2269
01:28:10,281 --> 01:28:13,640
don't think it would be that weird.
I think and bodybuilder dudes,

2270
01:28:13,641 --> 01:28:14,474
you remember King of the cage when they 
had that guy who was the king of the 

2271
01:28:16,331 --> 01:28:19,790
cage who was just gigantic it a 
bodybuilder.

2272
01:28:19,890 --> 01:28:20,723
Dude wasn't even fighting,
but he was the king of the king of the 

2273
01:28:23,091 --> 01:28:24,380
cage.
It didn't make any sense.

2274
01:28:24,381 --> 01:28:25,700
It was like,
what is happening here?

2275
01:28:25,701 --> 01:28:26,534
What is this supposed to represent?
It kind of goes back to branding and 

2276
01:28:28,671 --> 01:28:31,580
like the weird ways we do that.
Like how are we present ourselves to the

2277
01:28:31,581 --> 01:28:32,960
world or what we're trying to say.

2278
01:28:33,040 --> 01:28:34,000
Yeah,
yeah,

2279
01:28:34,640 --> 01:28:35,473
yeah.
Just the ring card girl thing is an odd 

2280
01:28:38,300 --> 01:28:39,380
thing.
It's,

2281
01:28:39,800 --> 01:28:42,710
and it's weird when you have an all 
female organization,

2282
01:28:43,100 --> 01:28:43,933
all female fighters,
but yet you still have girls holding up 

2283
01:28:47,901 --> 01:28:48,734
the cards

2284
01:28:49,680 --> 01:28:51,240
should go with dudes.
Well I'll,

2285
01:28:51,250 --> 01:28:52,083
I'll bring that up,
but I'm pretty sure Shannon wouldn't be 

2286
01:28:53,320 --> 01:28:57,260
unborn sage northcutt looking young 
fellows tram.

2287
01:28:57,410 --> 01:28:58,840
See,
and the thing is though,

2288
01:28:59,400 --> 01:29:00,700
you,
when you think about it though,

2289
01:29:00,701 --> 01:29:02,100
we think combat has been

2290
01:29:02,100 --> 01:29:06,360
so sexualized and stuff like that.
It wouldn't be out of the norm.

2291
01:29:06,390 --> 01:29:08,790
No.
But at the same time,

2292
01:29:08,980 --> 01:29:10,800
what are you even talking about it?
We laugh,

2293
01:29:10,801 --> 01:29:11,634
right?
Cause it shocks our sensibilities a 

2294
01:29:12,391 --> 01:29:13,500
little something.
We're not used to that.

2295
01:29:13,501 --> 01:29:14,520
That's weird.
So it's,

2296
01:29:14,910 --> 01:29:15,451
I mean,
what,

2297
01:29:15,451 --> 01:29:17,790
what did you think about females when 
they first started fighting him?

2298
01:29:17,791 --> 01:29:19,320
A man.
What'd you think about female fighting?

2299
01:29:19,590 --> 01:29:20,060
Like?

2300
01:29:20,060 --> 01:29:20,893
Well,
I had a chance to watch tough enough in 

2301
01:29:22,671 --> 01:29:24,500
Vegas.
Don't remember the event,

2302
01:29:24,860 --> 01:29:25,693
but nick the goat,
Thompson was on the card and there was 

2303
01:29:27,621 --> 01:29:28,340
this,
uh,

2304
01:29:28,340 --> 01:29:29,173
undercard fight between these two women 
and these gals went to war and we were 

2305
01:29:34,071 --> 01:29:34,904
in the front row and it was just chaos.
I wish I could remember who was 

2306
01:29:38,091 --> 01:29:38,924
fighting,
but it was such a wild and crazy fight 

2307
01:29:41,150 --> 01:29:41,983
that at the end of the fight,
everyone in the arena was his standing 

2308
01:29:44,631 --> 01:29:46,730
up,
screaming and cheering and clapping.

2309
01:29:47,030 --> 01:29:49,040
And I was with Eddie Bravo and we were 
both like,

2310
01:29:49,041 --> 01:29:50,630
dude,
I'm a fan of women fighting now.

2311
01:29:50,660 --> 01:29:51,180
I love it.

2312
01:29:51,180 --> 01:29:52,080
And what did you,
not before,

2313
01:29:52,081 --> 01:29:55,620
like what was that just you had to see 
them actually in action doing,

2314
01:29:55,980 --> 01:29:57,810
I guess being on that level or did you 
just,

2315
01:29:57,811 --> 01:30:00,000
it just wasn't on your,
on your radar before that

2316
01:30:00,100 --> 01:30:03,580
there wasn't enough of it to really 
compare what you had to see it,

2317
01:30:04,390 --> 01:30:05,110
you know,
you have,

2318
01:30:05,110 --> 01:30:07,840
it has to be presented to you.
Now I'm obviously a huge fan of it,

2319
01:30:07,841 --> 01:30:10,520
but you have to see it.
It's like we really,

2320
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:13,240
we weren't really exposed to it because 
it wasn't in the UFC.

2321
01:30:13,510 --> 01:30:15,340
So you'd have to go out and seek it.
And this is,

2322
01:30:15,341 --> 01:30:16,690
you know,
pre strike force.

2323
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:19,960
So it just wasn't something that people 
were,

2324
01:30:20,230 --> 01:30:22,780
were aware of and it wasn't like,
you know,

2325
01:30:22,781 --> 01:30:23,614
when you first started fighting and 
you're talking about trying to get a 

2326
01:30:24,911 --> 01:30:26,380
fight just wasn't that prevalent.
Right?

2327
01:30:26,440 --> 01:30:26,891
Yeah.
No,

2328
01:30:26,891 --> 01:30:30,130
I think that it wasn't,
I mean women didn't even know they could

2329
01:30:30,131 --> 01:30:30,690
fight.
Yeah.

2330
01:30:30,690 --> 01:30:32,110
You know,
and at a certain time.

2331
01:30:32,111 --> 01:30:32,944
So it's like shifting the attention to 
that when you can actually watch these 

2332
01:30:36,040 --> 01:30:37,570
dudes who are fighting,
you know,

2333
01:30:37,571 --> 01:30:39,070
you don't have to think of that on your 
radar.

2334
01:30:39,071 --> 01:30:41,200
You don't have to seek that out.
If you're actually seeing fights,

2335
01:30:41,560 --> 01:30:43,690
unless it's given to your list,
presented to you,

2336
01:30:44,080 --> 01:30:45,580
you know,
then why,

2337
01:30:45,760 --> 01:30:47,260
you know,
why would it be on the radar?

2338
01:30:47,530 --> 01:30:48,363
Just think of it.

2339
01:30:48,420 --> 01:30:49,253
Women finding was also in my mind,
connected to a certain sense of 

2340
01:30:51,901 --> 01:30:54,960
frustration for the athletes that they 
had.

2341
01:30:55,050 --> 01:30:58,830
Like Lucy,
a riker could never get Christy Martin a

2342
01:30:58,831 --> 01:30:59,670
fighter.
You know,

2343
01:30:59,671 --> 01:31:00,504
there was always that thing.
Like I'd always known lucy a Ryko was 

2344
01:31:02,491 --> 01:31:05,070
like the best women boxer and everybody 
kind of knew,

2345
01:31:05,280 --> 01:31:06,113
but she couldn't get that fight like 
where everybody would know how good she 

2346
01:31:09,901 --> 01:31:11,340
was.
And then everybody's like,

2347
01:31:11,341 --> 01:31:13,290
oh Cristina Martins,
the best female box.

2348
01:31:13,291 --> 01:31:14,130
I'm like God damn it.
No,

2349
01:31:14,131 --> 01:31:14,964
she's not like you got to,
she's got to fight this woman from 

2350
01:31:17,341 --> 01:31:18,450
Holland,
you know.

2351
01:31:18,451 --> 01:31:19,284
And then to sort of never happened.
And then you know there was mia st John 

2352
01:31:21,781 --> 01:31:22,614
who was more like a girls,
a good boxer and she was cute and she 

2353
01:31:25,771 --> 01:31:29,280
was really working that angle.
And then there's Laila Ali of course who

2354
01:31:29,281 --> 01:31:32,670
was Muhammad Ali's daughter,
but there was no one who caught fire.

2355
01:31:32,880 --> 01:31:34,290
There was no one,
there was no like,

2356
01:31:34,500 --> 01:31:36,540
oh my God,
this girl is going to fight this fight.

2357
01:31:36,541 --> 01:31:38,340
This is going to it.
Like what we have now,

2358
01:31:38,490 --> 01:31:40,920
like what we have now in MMA is 
incredibly unique.

2359
01:31:41,190 --> 01:31:42,023
You know like Valentina Shevchenko and 
Amanda Nunez did is just to super high 

2360
01:31:47,011 --> 01:31:47,844
level MMA fighters who happened to be 
women who have worked their way up the 

2361
01:31:51,421 --> 01:31:53,880
ladder.
Amanda Nunez is obviously the champion.

2362
01:31:53,881 --> 01:31:57,090
Valentina though is just knocking on 
that fucking door.

2363
01:31:57,360 --> 01:31:58,193
And that is an exciting dynamic matchup 
for the women's bantamweight title that 

2364
01:32:01,721 --> 01:32:03,070
didn't exist in boxing.
Right.

2365
01:32:03,100 --> 01:32:05,620
There was never that sort of match up 
buildup thing.

2366
01:32:05,860 --> 01:32:06,693
And by the way,
there's other people waiting pass 

2367
01:32:09,251 --> 01:32:10,640
Valentino,
you know there's,

2368
01:32:11,140 --> 01:32:12,400
there's,
there's contenders,

2369
01:32:12,401 --> 01:32:15,880
it's real and there's contenders at 
Straw weight as well.

2370
01:32:15,881 --> 01:32:16,714
It's real.
And so I think that there was always 

2371
01:32:19,541 --> 01:32:22,780
this sort of thing there was connected 
with women fighting like that.

2372
01:32:22,781 --> 01:32:23,614
It wasn't legit,
but it was kind of like the w nba isn't 

2373
01:32:25,870 --> 01:32:26,703
as good as,
as an athlete as some of those players 

2374
01:32:28,961 --> 01:32:31,690
are.
No one gives a fuck in this country.

2375
01:32:31,691 --> 01:32:33,100
It just doesn't catch on.
You know,

2376
01:32:33,101 --> 01:32:34,690
I'm sure they give a fuck in the,
probably mad at that.

2377
01:32:34,691 --> 01:32:35,524
I'm saying that.
But

2378
01:32:36,740 --> 01:32:40,570
you mean marketing wise for some,
for whatever reason it wasn't seen as a,

2379
01:32:40,590 --> 01:32:42,810
it's not seen as an equal sphere to the 
NBA.

2380
01:32:42,870 --> 01:32:43,703
Right.
And what's been unique about female 

2381
01:32:46,590 --> 01:32:51,590
fighters in MMA is that because they can
share the same octagon on the same night

2382
01:32:51,870 --> 01:32:53,340
because they're in the same playing 
field.

2383
01:32:53,370 --> 01:32:57,030
Then there's a,
there's a chance to see more of an equal

2384
01:32:57,031 --> 01:32:57,480
setting.

2385
01:32:57,480 --> 01:32:58,770
Oh,
100% yeah.

2386
01:32:58,771 --> 01:33:00,600
I think that's hugely important.
I mean,

2387
01:33:00,601 --> 01:33:03,300
when you have someone like Rhonda Rousey
who's headlining,

2388
01:33:03,330 --> 01:33:06,300
I am massive card and the paper view 
sells 1.5

2389
01:33:06,301 --> 01:33:07,134
million buys.
That is gigantic for women's combat 

2390
01:33:09,931 --> 01:33:10,764
sport,
for combat sports in general and it's 

2391
01:33:12,241 --> 01:33:14,310
unprecedented.
Anybody who says it's not,

2392
01:33:14,311 --> 01:33:15,330
it's crazy.
There.

2393
01:33:15,720 --> 01:33:16,553
Before Ronda Rousey came along,
there had never been an athlete like 

2394
01:33:18,631 --> 01:33:19,464
that that had been dominating in a 
combat sport in on a worldwide scale 

2395
01:33:24,031 --> 01:33:26,490
where everybody knew who she was.
Let's say it's totally uncharted.

2396
01:33:26,550 --> 01:33:27,360
Terry,
she was,

2397
01:33:27,360 --> 01:33:31,830
she was the mainstream appeal of it 
somehow with what she presented.

2398
01:33:31,831 --> 01:33:32,880
Well,
she's an incredible person,

2399
01:33:32,881 --> 01:33:34,830
but for with what she presented,
she,

2400
01:33:35,160 --> 01:33:38,570
she had the,
the package that that transcended over.

2401
01:33:38,571 --> 01:33:39,404
This is a female fighter.
It was Ronda Rousey as a fighter and of 

2402
01:33:41,251 --> 01:33:43,860
course they focused on her femininity.
They focused on her being a female,

2403
01:33:44,220 --> 01:33:46,620
but at the same time,
I mean she was doing way better than the

2404
01:33:46,621 --> 01:33:48,930
men when it came to universal appeal and
stuff like that.

2405
01:33:48,931 --> 01:33:50,430
Like there was something that she 
crossed,

2406
01:33:50,520 --> 01:33:51,960
well,
she was a unique thing

2407
01:33:52,420 --> 01:33:53,770
is this unique thing.
Yeah.

2408
01:33:53,980 --> 01:33:56,350
And I think that that just did not 
exist.

2409
01:33:56,380 --> 01:33:57,213
I mean,
Gina Carano sorta caught it a little 

2410
01:33:58,781 --> 01:34:02,410
bit,
but she was gone before it really caught

2411
01:34:02,411 --> 01:34:03,400
fire,
you know?

2412
01:34:03,401 --> 01:34:06,310
And then when she lost a Cyborg,
there was a,

2413
01:34:06,690 --> 01:34:07,523
there was a lot of like weird feelings 
about that because there's all these 

2414
01:34:10,481 --> 01:34:11,314
speculations as Cyborg was on drugs and 
then they looked at Gina Carano and she 

2415
01:34:14,621 --> 01:34:15,454
was all beat up afterwards.
And that left is sort of weird taste in 

2416
01:34:18,281 --> 01:34:18,940
people.

2417
01:34:18,940 --> 01:34:21,190
I understand that.
And I think that,

2418
01:34:21,250 --> 01:34:24,000
um,
around their eyes are tasty.

2419
01:34:24,340 --> 01:34:24,851
Um,
no,

2420
01:34:24,851 --> 01:34:27,070
I think that there's something to that.
I think,

2421
01:34:27,071 --> 01:34:29,890
um,
it's unfortunate because I'm like,

2422
01:34:29,920 --> 01:34:31,290
I know Chris Cyborg,
you know,

2423
01:34:31,540 --> 01:34:33,030
I was the matchmaker,
you know,

2424
01:34:33,050 --> 01:34:34,720
within victim when she was fighting for 
us.

2425
01:34:34,721 --> 01:34:35,554
And I,
I was there for her weight cuts and I 

2426
01:34:36,791 --> 01:34:38,500
saw some of her struggles and,
and what,

2427
01:34:38,501 --> 01:34:39,160
uh,
kind,

2428
01:34:39,160 --> 01:34:41,950
kind person,
she is just a genuinely kind person.

2429
01:34:42,130 --> 01:34:42,963
But then there's this persona of 
toughness and her saying this kind of 

2430
01:34:44,831 --> 01:34:45,664
thing to Rondo or she's saying this to 
Gina and then they're sending it back 

2431
01:34:47,411 --> 01:34:48,460
and it's this,
that,

2432
01:34:48,461 --> 01:34:50,020
you know,
and it just like for some reason,

2433
01:34:50,021 --> 01:34:51,790
um,
I never thought she got the,

2434
01:34:51,791 --> 01:34:53,860
um,
the respect that was due,

2435
01:34:53,861 --> 01:34:55,900
but at the same time,
then she did fail a drug test.

2436
01:34:55,901 --> 01:34:56,980
So it was like,
ah,

2437
01:34:57,020 --> 01:34:57,853
like

2438
01:34:58,130 --> 01:34:58,963
unfortunately you carry the burden of 
having your entire legacy be questioned 

2439
01:35:02,540 --> 01:35:03,740
when you mess up like that.

2440
01:35:03,940 --> 01:35:06,310
But we know what the human body,
it looks like,

2441
01:35:06,730 --> 01:35:07,563
you know,
you know what a female body looks like 

2442
01:35:09,011 --> 01:35:09,844
and you know what someone looks like 
when they most likely have been 

2443
01:35:12,881 --> 01:35:15,370
introducing male hormones into a female 
body.

2444
01:35:15,700 --> 01:35:17,110
I don't,
I,

2445
01:35:17,111 --> 01:35:17,681
you know,
I,

2446
01:35:17,681 --> 01:35:21,520
I understand what you're saying because 
we know what we think is normal or what,

2447
01:35:21,550 --> 01:35:22,810
you know,
what a female body is like.

2448
01:35:22,811 --> 01:35:24,190
But I would say that,
uh,

2449
01:35:25,090 --> 01:35:27,460
we know what a male body looks like to 
yeah.

2450
01:35:27,461 --> 01:35:28,950
Without hormones and we,
yeah,

2451
01:35:28,960 --> 01:35:29,793
and I mean,
you look at somebody who's like perfect 

2452
01:35:30,611 --> 01:35:31,960
physique,
sage northcutt.

2453
01:35:32,350 --> 01:35:34,060
I mean it is everybody's speculating 
the,

2454
01:35:34,061 --> 01:35:35,920
he's on steroids because he looks a 
certain way.

2455
01:35:35,950 --> 01:35:36,783
Cause I,
I met the kid when he was a kid and he 

2456
01:35:38,861 --> 01:35:39,510
looked like that.

2457
01:35:39,510 --> 01:35:42,510
The problem that line of thinking is 
that he's a male.

2458
01:35:42,690 --> 01:35:44,880
Right.
And then he has natural testosterone and

2459
01:35:44,881 --> 01:35:47,610
then you can accentuate natural 
testosterone pretty significantly,

2460
01:35:47,611 --> 01:35:50,100
especially if you're someone like a 
Kevin randleman.

2461
01:35:50,220 --> 01:35:51,070
Right.
Or you know,

2462
01:35:51,090 --> 01:35:51,923
like a,
a Marvin Eastman who just has this 

2463
01:35:53,640 --> 01:35:54,473
extreme mesomorphic bill.
There's a lot of people that are built 

2464
01:35:56,911 --> 01:36:00,930
that way that don't do anything illegal.
There's not a lot of women that are,

2465
01:36:01,660 --> 01:36:02,201
yeah,
I,

2466
01:36:02,201 --> 01:36:02,980
you know,
I,

2467
01:36:02,980 --> 01:36:05,320
again,
when we do the eye test like that,

2468
01:36:05,321 --> 01:36:07,390
like I,
I completely understand that my,

2469
01:36:07,391 --> 01:36:11,040
um,
I guess I wanted to believe of course,

2470
01:36:11,080 --> 01:36:13,450
that I wanted to believe that Cyborg was
drug free.

2471
01:36:13,451 --> 01:36:15,880
And now I believe that she is,
I believe that she's not currently,

2472
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:16,990
yeah,
I believe that she's,

2473
01:36:17,020 --> 01:36:20,170
whatever happened in that time in 2011 
she has rectified it.

2474
01:36:20,171 --> 01:36:22,630
She's passed all of her,
I guess something happened.

2475
01:36:22,730 --> 01:36:25,420
I'm not really because it was with the 
UFC with some kind of task,

2476
01:36:25,421 --> 01:36:27,910
but it turned out it was with her birth 
control pills or something.

2477
01:36:28,140 --> 01:36:29,710
What kind of behind him?
Yeah.

2478
01:36:29,730 --> 01:36:31,510
Something happened with her birth can or
something,

2479
01:36:31,690 --> 01:36:33,070
something happened there,
but

2480
01:36:33,530 --> 01:36:34,940
notes,
spironolactone,

2481
01:36:34,941 --> 01:36:35,774
spironolactone,
which is a dht inhibitor with 

2482
01:36:38,091 --> 01:36:41,570
dihydrotestosterone inhibitor that is 
used for a bunch of different reasons.

2483
01:36:41,571 --> 01:36:43,080
It's used as a,
um,

2484
01:36:43,730 --> 01:36:44,563
it's used as a diuretic.
It's used for people combating the 

2485
01:36:47,721 --> 01:36:51,560
effects of anabolic steroids for females
combating the effect.

2486
01:36:51,561 --> 01:36:52,394
It's used for cysts.
It's used for a bunch of different 

2487
01:36:55,701 --> 01:36:57,560
possible reasons to use it.
Right?

2488
01:36:57,640 --> 01:36:58,280
Yeah.
I think,

2489
01:36:58,280 --> 01:36:59,113
yeah,
cause I think I've known someone who's 

2490
01:37:00,141 --> 01:37:02,570
been on that for cystic acne before,
so I understand.

2491
01:37:02,960 --> 01:37:05,180
I don't understand what happened in all 
of that.

2492
01:37:05,181 --> 01:37:07,580
And I would love to,
I need to read about it.

2493
01:37:07,600 --> 01:37:08,720
I,
I'd love to know more about it.

2494
01:37:08,721 --> 01:37:11,270
It wasn't my,
in my sphere of interest.

2495
01:37:11,271 --> 01:37:11,761
Exactly.
Right.

2496
01:37:11,761 --> 01:37:12,260
Right,
right.

2497
01:37:12,260 --> 01:37:14,540
But you know,
pre 2011 drug test,

2498
01:37:14,541 --> 01:37:15,374
I wanted to believe she was natural 
because I wanted to believe in her and 

2499
01:37:17,181 --> 01:37:22,181
believe that somebody could be that 
vicious and ferocious and wonderful like

2500
01:37:23,091 --> 01:37:23,924
that and take it,
take the idea of women fighting to a 

2501
01:37:26,901 --> 01:37:29,830
different level.
And when she tested positive for,

2502
01:37:29,850 --> 01:37:30,880
for the,
um,

2503
01:37:30,920 --> 01:37:35,920
it was a d stands yes.
Stands something in $2,011

2504
01:37:36,730 --> 01:37:37,880
a wall.
Yeah.

2505
01:37:37,881 --> 01:37:38,511
And then,
you know,

2506
01:37:38,511 --> 01:37:41,180
and then I was just,
I was heartbroken because first of all,

2507
01:37:41,181 --> 01:37:41,901
you know,
it was just like,

2508
01:37:41,901 --> 01:37:43,910
there was this,
I didn't believe anymore.

2509
01:37:43,911 --> 01:37:44,744
And then I got,
I got to meet her actually in 

2510
01:37:45,710 --> 01:37:48,020
professional setting and I got to know 
her as a person.

2511
01:37:48,260 --> 01:37:49,700
And you realize that when you know 
people,

2512
01:37:49,701 --> 01:37:52,280
it's a lot more new on student,
I believe in you as a person and not,

2513
01:37:52,281 --> 01:37:53,150
you know what,
you know what I mean?

2514
01:37:53,151 --> 01:37:55,710
Like I believed in a lot of guys that 
turned out to be taken steroids.

2515
01:37:55,711 --> 01:37:56,544
Yeah.
And it's,

2516
01:37:56,580 --> 01:37:58,020
yeah,
it's weird to associate,

2517
01:37:58,021 --> 01:37:59,950
I guess.
I never,

2518
01:38:00,010 --> 01:38:02,680
well you're a nice person.
You're kind what you wish for the best.

2519
01:38:03,020 --> 01:38:03,853
I do,
but I also wish for the best for women 

2520
01:38:05,061 --> 01:38:07,670
all the time and that we're not going to
mess up,

2521
01:38:08,180 --> 01:38:10,460
but if everybody's got a message for 
women,

2522
01:38:10,461 --> 01:38:11,294
wouldn't you definitely want to take a 
hard stance against someone who's 

2523
01:38:13,700 --> 01:38:17,100
introducing male hormones into a female 
body and that you know,

2524
01:38:17,110 --> 01:38:17,943
they'll also,
the problem that is lot of the effects 

2525
01:38:19,641 --> 01:38:20,840
are permanent,
like the,

2526
01:38:20,841 --> 01:38:25,070
a lot of the effects of a woman altering
her physiology with male hormones.

2527
01:38:25,100 --> 01:38:25,933
There's a certain amount of those 
effects and this is also argued against 

2528
01:38:28,221 --> 01:38:29,054
men taking steroids.
There's a certain amount and there's 

2529
01:38:30,711 --> 01:38:33,980
been tests about this.
This isn't just speculation that certain

2530
01:38:34,010 --> 01:38:37,220
amount of physiological changes are 
permanent.

2531
01:38:37,430 --> 01:38:38,263
When you take steroids because you're 
introducing these hyper human levels of 

2532
01:38:42,171 --> 01:38:45,350
testosterone to a mail system and things
change,

2533
01:38:45,351 --> 01:38:47,930
bone density changes,
the shape of your body changes,

2534
01:38:47,980 --> 01:38:49,610
the did tendon strength changes,

2535
01:38:49,760 --> 01:38:50,593
right,
and your testicles shrink and certainly 

2536
01:38:51,861 --> 01:38:53,390
cause you,
you don't have the ability to like,

2537
01:38:53,940 --> 01:38:56,910
yeah,
that comes back like the,

2538
01:38:56,960 --> 01:38:57,793
the testicular atrophy.
It's like it's really the shutdown of 

2539
01:39:00,211 --> 01:39:01,044
the endocrine system,
but that comes back and when it comes 

2540
01:39:02,971 --> 01:39:03,804
back,
there's a certain amount of the 

2541
01:39:04,651 --> 01:39:05,484
improvements that you've received 
because of the steroids that you will 

2542
01:39:07,321 --> 01:39:08,154
keep forever.

2543
01:39:08,220 --> 01:39:11,430
So even when you're in that exact post 
steroid area.

2544
01:39:11,460 --> 01:39:12,030
Yeah,

2545
01:39:12,030 --> 01:39:14,300
which is one of the things that 
infuriates people that have been cleaned

2546
01:39:14,301 --> 01:39:15,134
their whole life is that someone can 
test positive and then they continue on 

2547
01:39:19,041 --> 01:39:19,874
their career.
Even if they're not taking steroids now 

2548
01:39:21,800 --> 01:39:23,390
they have a,
a benefit.

2549
01:39:23,450 --> 01:39:26,600
They have a permanent benefit of taking 
those illegal drugs.

2550
01:39:27,740 --> 01:39:29,030
That sucks.
Yes.

2551
01:39:29,250 --> 01:39:30,083
I mean it's,
I mean there's nothing I can say like 

2552
01:39:31,341 --> 01:39:33,320
that would champion that being a good 
thing.

2553
01:39:33,321 --> 01:39:35,780
It's not a good thing.
But I will say that like,

2554
01:39:35,810 --> 01:39:39,020
she did not test positive the entire,
you know,

2555
01:39:39,021 --> 01:39:43,040
since 2011 and so if there was that 
advantage in something like that,

2556
01:39:43,070 --> 01:39:43,903
we saw somebody like you bearish and 
kickboxing still work against that and 

2557
01:39:47,601 --> 01:39:49,730
still find victory.
So I,

2558
01:39:50,690 --> 01:39:51,510
I don't know

2559
01:39:51,510 --> 01:39:53,340
when should someone have to work against
that?

2560
01:39:53,341 --> 01:39:54,174
First of all,
there's Eurena barge fight was a 

2561
01:39:55,021 --> 01:39:56,840
testament to cyborgs.
Courage.

2562
01:39:56,880 --> 01:40:00,570
And and fighting spirit that she took 
that fight because nobody wanted a fight

2563
01:40:00,571 --> 01:40:03,750
Joanna for a long time.
And if you don't know who Julian a barge

2564
01:40:03,751 --> 01:40:05,370
is,
if you watch her Moitai fight,

2565
01:40:05,371 --> 01:40:08,670
she's some ungodly number of fights 
she's had.

2566
01:40:08,671 --> 01:40:09,504
She's a multiple time world champion and
she's just so stunningly technical as a 

2567
01:40:13,351 --> 01:40:14,790
fighter.
But you know,

2568
01:40:14,791 --> 01:40:17,310
you look at them physically,
they look very,

2569
01:40:17,311 --> 01:40:18,540
very different.
You know,

2570
01:40:18,570 --> 01:40:19,403
beside Borg is just this attacker 
berserker style and fought a very good 

2571
01:40:22,771 --> 01:40:25,350
fight against girl that nobody wanted to
fight.

2572
01:40:25,380 --> 01:40:27,510
It was a wonderful,
fantastic fight.

2573
01:40:27,630 --> 01:40:30,950
One of those fights even in in a loss 
like her stock came out.

2574
01:40:32,040 --> 01:40:32,820
Yes.
Cyborg things.

2575
01:40:32,820 --> 01:40:33,970
I hate her.
Look I,

2576
01:40:34,030 --> 01:40:34,863
I think she's awesome.
I'm a fan and I tweeted this many times 

2577
01:40:37,261 --> 01:40:40,260
along that the UFC needs to make 145 
pound women's division,

2578
01:40:40,290 --> 01:40:44,970
but there's also some realities that you
have to address and those realities have

2579
01:40:44,971 --> 01:40:45,804
to be addressed for the other women that
haven't done anything as well to still 

2580
01:40:48,450 --> 01:40:49,283
look up for them.

2581
01:40:49,360 --> 01:40:50,650
I,
I think you're right about that.

2582
01:40:50,651 --> 01:40:53,050
I think that when people test positive 
I,

2583
01:40:53,290 --> 01:40:54,370
that the,
the penalties

2584
01:40:54,370 --> 01:40:55,720
have to be harsh.
They have to be hard.

2585
01:40:55,721 --> 01:40:59,560
And I don't know what's going on with 
the new testing and stuff like that.

2586
01:40:59,561 --> 01:41:00,970
I'm not,
I don't,

2587
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:02,890
I'm not in the know when it comes to the
UFC,

2588
01:41:02,891 --> 01:41:04,390
I'm no longer on a team,
you know what I mean?

2589
01:41:04,391 --> 01:41:06,430
It's like everything I do,
I've read through MMA media now,

2590
01:41:06,431 --> 01:41:07,380
so,
um,

2591
01:41:07,400 --> 01:41:09,340
I don't know who's testing one and 
what's going on,

2592
01:41:09,341 --> 01:41:12,580
but I will say that the men had been 
doing it for so long as well.

2593
01:41:12,581 --> 01:41:17,050
So should men who were clean have to 
have fought against men who were dirty?

2594
01:41:17,080 --> 01:41:19,030
Very good question.
A lot of people think they shouldn't.

2595
01:41:19,090 --> 01:41:19,923
Yeah.
So I don't know what we do about clean 

2596
01:41:22,091 --> 01:41:23,080
slating at,
at this point.

2597
01:41:23,260 --> 01:41:25,060
And it's also,
is it the same thing?

2598
01:41:25,090 --> 01:41:25,923
Is a man taking male hormones the same 
as a woman taking male hormone already 

2599
01:41:29,531 --> 01:41:31,390
has the male hormones,
right?

2600
01:41:31,600 --> 01:41:36,060
Wouldn't that be even more of an 
increase than a woman taking?

2601
01:41:36,061 --> 01:41:37,060
Cause if a woman,
I mean,

2602
01:41:37,300 --> 01:41:38,170
no.
Okay.

2603
01:41:38,470 --> 01:41:39,303
No,
because a woman's adjusting her 

2604
01:41:39,701 --> 01:41:40,534
physiology and becoming masculine,
whereas a man is becoming more 

2605
01:41:42,461 --> 01:41:44,260
masculine.
There's a,

2606
01:41:44,460 --> 01:41:45,293
which is a shift literally in the body 
structure that happens to women when 

2607
01:41:48,101 --> 01:41:52,330
they start taking testosterone.
That's why a transgender man goes from a

2608
01:41:52,331 --> 01:41:54,510
woman to a man.
All such grows a beard,

2609
01:41:54,570 --> 01:41:55,403
right?
Chaz Bono changes the shape of your 

2610
01:41:56,651 --> 01:41:58,510
face,
changes the tone of your voice,

2611
01:41:58,511 --> 01:42:00,040
your voice gets deeper.
I mean,

2612
01:42:00,041 --> 01:42:02,260
so many different factors play in it.
I mean,

2613
01:42:02,261 --> 01:42:04,090
it's really depends on,
there's no,

2614
01:42:04,150 --> 01:42:07,540
there's also,
there's a rainbow or a broad spectrum of

2615
01:42:07,541 --> 01:42:09,730
dosages.
Like who knows how much you're taking,

2616
01:42:09,910 --> 01:42:10,743
how long you're taking it for.
And then there's also massive negative 

2617
01:42:14,441 --> 01:42:16,990
consequences health wise for women.
That's what's,

2618
01:42:17,120 --> 01:42:19,240
I mean,
it's already hell on your body to fight.

2619
01:42:19,430 --> 01:42:20,263
Um,
and it's hell on your body to be a 

2620
01:42:21,131 --> 01:42:23,500
female athlete in many ways.
It's wonderful and encouraging,

2621
01:42:23,530 --> 01:42:24,990
but you're right.
And I,

2622
01:42:24,991 --> 01:42:27,160
I again,
I don't have an answer for that.

2623
01:42:27,161 --> 01:42:27,994
I don't think there's a clean slate.
I do think that Cris Cyborg is in the 

2624
01:42:30,161 --> 01:42:30,994
position right now with our career and 
with the things have been questioned 

2625
01:42:33,431 --> 01:42:34,330
about are the things that have been 
done.

2626
01:42:34,331 --> 01:42:39,331
She has actually opportunity now to 
really spearhead making it all clean and

2627
01:42:39,341 --> 01:42:40,031
coming,
you know,

2628
01:42:40,031 --> 01:42:42,680
coming forward with whatever happened in
the past with the spiritual,

2629
01:42:42,700 --> 01:42:45,190
I forgot the name of [inaudible],
all of that,

2630
01:42:45,191 --> 01:42:48,010
but that was concerned because it's not 
really a performance enhancing drug.

2631
01:42:48,640 --> 01:42:52,430
The spironolactone is not going to,
it's not performance enhancing style.

2632
01:42:53,740 --> 01:42:54,573
It wasn't a failed test then.
It was not prohibited or it is 

2633
01:42:57,671 --> 01:42:59,290
prohibited.
But she could get a,

2634
01:42:59,330 --> 01:43:01,810
uh,
therapy therapeutic use exemption.

2635
01:43:01,840 --> 01:43:02,620
They did.
She,

2636
01:43:02,620 --> 01:43:03,453
I think she did it achieve,
they're doing that or in the process of 

2637
01:43:06,011 --> 01:43:08,800
trying to do that,
maybe it has been cleared.

2638
01:43:09,270 --> 01:43:10,750
What that means is,
look,

2639
01:43:10,780 --> 01:43:13,000
it's not hurting anybody she competes 
against.

2640
01:43:13,001 --> 01:43:16,510
It's not that it's just,
they don't like people taking it because

2641
01:43:16,511 --> 01:43:20,220
it can mask some of the effects of 
Androgens in,

2642
01:43:20,230 --> 01:43:22,360
in the female body.
And it also,

2643
01:43:22,420 --> 01:43:24,460
um,
as a diuretic.

2644
01:43:24,820 --> 01:43:25,653
Diuretics are illegal because diuretics 
also can mask some of the potential 

2645
01:43:30,880 --> 01:43:35,440
properties of testosterone or hormones 
or they did away with all the ivy.

2646
01:43:35,441 --> 01:43:38,910
Rehydration is only person who liked ivy
and rehydration.

2647
01:43:39,050 --> 01:43:39,883
You're the only one.
I think there's a lot of people like to 

2648
01:43:41,410 --> 01:43:43,630
live.
I mean I was clean.

2649
01:43:44,050 --> 01:43:44,883
I hate to say that I was clean my whole 
life but I was po possibly because 

2650
01:43:48,701 --> 01:43:49,534
nobody ever offered me anything.
If somebody offered you steroids you 

2651
01:43:51,141 --> 01:43:51,860
thing you would have taken it.

2652
01:43:51,860 --> 01:43:53,270
I don't know.
I look back now and I'm like,

2653
01:43:53,271 --> 01:43:55,610
I wonder how many other women anyway.
Yeah.

2654
01:43:55,611 --> 01:43:57,440
What if it was back in the day like the 
wild west,

2655
01:43:57,441 --> 01:44:00,230
like pride days,
like pride days where the wild west,

2656
01:44:00,560 --> 01:44:01,393
like during pride,
like I talked to [inaudible] in any way 

2657
01:44:03,411 --> 01:44:04,244
he dealt,
he described about his con is contract 

2658
01:44:05,991 --> 01:44:10,280
literally in capital letter said we will
not test you for steroids and answer was

2659
01:44:10,281 --> 01:44:13,010
laughing about it and was like fucking 
everybody was on shit back then.

2660
01:44:14,570 --> 01:44:17,840
Did that question I think I probably 
would have if I'd have been offered it.

2661
01:44:17,841 --> 01:44:18,674
I don't know.
But then you think about that and then 

2662
01:44:19,431 --> 01:44:20,330
you think about,
okay,

2663
01:44:20,630 --> 01:44:23,180
2011 was just on the cusp of being the 
wild west.

2664
01:44:23,181 --> 01:44:26,660
Right.
So if she did take steroids,

2665
01:44:26,661 --> 01:44:27,494
if she was on something,
isn't that just what everybody else was 

2666
01:44:29,961 --> 01:44:30,794
trying to do?

2667
01:44:31,010 --> 01:44:32,960
Some people were,
I don't think Gina was doing it.

2668
01:44:33,300 --> 01:44:35,590
Gina Carano Gina did it at all.
No,

2669
01:44:35,740 --> 01:44:37,910
some women definitely did for shooting.
I mean,

2670
01:44:37,911 --> 01:44:39,800
you look at the old pictures that the 
fighters,

2671
01:44:39,801 --> 01:44:43,310
the generation before me,
and I'm not throwing out accusations,

2672
01:44:43,311 --> 01:44:45,190
I'm just saying people with Musculature,
like,

2673
01:44:45,250 --> 01:44:46,940
like Becky,
Levi and people like that.

2674
01:44:46,941 --> 01:44:48,740
You kind of wonder like,
okay,

2675
01:44:48,770 --> 01:44:50,840
how much of that was,
you know?

2676
01:44:51,500 --> 01:44:52,333
Well,
I know girls that just compete in Jiu 

2677
01:44:53,390 --> 01:44:54,240
Jitsu tournaments,
that dues test,

2678
01:44:54,241 --> 01:44:56,090
test testosterone.
I mean,

2679
01:44:56,091 --> 01:44:58,760
they just want to be stronger and better
and there's no money in it.

2680
01:44:58,820 --> 01:45:01,670
They're just trying to get an edge.
And it's kind of weird.

2681
01:45:01,700 --> 01:45:02,300
You know,
it's,

2682
01:45:02,300 --> 01:45:03,920
it's weird.
It's,

2683
01:45:04,180 --> 01:45:04,890
you know,
they're,

2684
01:45:04,890 --> 01:45:05,723
it's amateur and no one's testing and 
they say everyone's doing it so they're 

2685
01:45:09,321 --> 01:45:10,250
doing it.
So you go,

2686
01:45:10,251 --> 01:45:11,060
okay,
look,

2687
01:45:11,060 --> 01:45:12,350
I've got no position on this.
I mean,

2688
01:45:12,351 --> 01:45:13,280
I don't know.
I don't know what to say,

2689
01:45:13,850 --> 01:45:17,390
but when it comes to mma and when it 
comes to professional sports,

2690
01:45:17,391 --> 01:45:19,700
and back then,
if it was the wild west,

2691
01:45:19,730 --> 01:45:22,160
I'm sure a lot of people were doing it,
you know?

2692
01:45:22,670 --> 01:45:26,240
But Chris Cyborg became sort of the 
poster girl when she looked the part and

2693
01:45:26,241 --> 01:45:27,200
then tested positive.

2694
01:45:29,210 --> 01:45:30,890
I mean,
what do we do with that now?

2695
01:45:30,900 --> 01:45:32,140
That's a good question.
What do we do it,

2696
01:45:32,630 --> 01:45:35,510
because the guidebook,
I think she's a phenomenal woman.

2697
01:45:35,511 --> 01:45:36,344
I think she's a kind and good woman and 
a wonderful fighter for people to look 

2698
01:45:39,231 --> 01:45:41,090
up to.
So I don't,

2699
01:45:41,810 --> 01:45:44,810
I don't know what you do with that now.
I think that what has to go on the table

2700
01:45:44,811 --> 01:45:45,644
is just,
we take everything by what happens 

2701
01:45:48,261 --> 01:45:52,010
today.
And if a person doesn't test positive,

2702
01:45:52,250 --> 01:45:54,950
we take them at their word.
The real problem though,

2703
01:45:54,980 --> 01:45:58,430
with what's going on today as they're 
offering these massively steep,

2704
01:45:58,940 --> 01:46:02,090
steep sentences for people and 
suspensions for people.

2705
01:46:02,091 --> 01:46:05,750
So like first if you get caught,
I think the first suspension is like two

2706
01:46:05,751 --> 01:46:09,290
years and that if you get caught again 
it's even deeper and then three years,

2707
01:46:09,291 --> 01:46:11,360
it's three times.
If you get caught a third time,

2708
01:46:11,361 --> 01:46:12,194
it's like life,
like Vander Lee silver one is the most 

2709
01:46:14,871 --> 01:46:15,704
disturbing one to me because he ran away
from a test and they banned him for 

2710
01:46:18,681 --> 01:46:19,040
life.

2711
01:46:19,040 --> 01:46:21,290
Like die is fucking,
that's abusive.

2712
01:46:21,320 --> 01:46:22,910
Yeah.
You gotta wonder how many other fighters

2713
01:46:22,911 --> 01:46:25,730
have run away from it but it just wasn't
as public like you know.

2714
01:46:25,760 --> 01:46:27,110
Sure it will.
Not only that,

2715
01:46:27,111 --> 01:46:27,944
but when you talk to chill son and about
how sketchy the Usada people were when 

2716
01:46:30,831 --> 01:46:31,664
they came to him,
like they made them do it in a broom 

2717
01:46:32,811 --> 01:46:35,090
closet and give boys like this is this 
sterile?

2718
01:46:35,091 --> 01:46:36,500
Like who are you?
Do you have an id?

2719
01:46:36,770 --> 01:46:38,690
Like they don't even,
they don't want to give you ID.

2720
01:46:38,691 --> 01:46:42,260
They just want to test right away and 
you just have to listen to them.

2721
01:46:43,270 --> 01:46:45,380
In the case of him where they may be 
trying to hawk.

2722
01:46:45,381 --> 01:46:47,910
I am a little bit more just because of 
his past shown,

2723
01:46:48,560 --> 01:46:49,650
but it is,
um,

2724
01:46:50,580 --> 01:46:51,413
I don't know.
I don't know when it comes to 

2725
01:46:53,641 --> 01:46:55,800
regulation,
who regulates the regulators?

2726
01:46:55,801 --> 01:46:57,180
Like that is the question,
right?

2727
01:46:57,540 --> 01:46:58,560
The question.
Yeah.

2728
01:46:58,710 --> 01:47:02,790
But at the same time,
we don't want this taken away from us.

2729
01:47:02,880 --> 01:47:04,890
Right.
Like this whole thing that the,

2730
01:47:04,920 --> 01:47:06,870
the moments of passion,
the Darren Elkins moments,

2731
01:47:06,871 --> 01:47:07,704
we don't want that taken away from us.
And to have that soured by knowing that 

2732
01:47:10,921 --> 01:47:13,590
that person was cheating was cheating.
You know,

2733
01:47:13,591 --> 01:47:14,424
it's,
I think there's a huge emotional 

2734
01:47:16,141 --> 01:47:17,910
investment to see a clean sport.
Well,

2735
01:47:17,911 --> 01:47:20,430
how about the greatest of gray areas,
which is Vito Belfort.

2736
01:47:20,460 --> 01:47:21,720
Yeah.
They let them,

2737
01:47:22,080 --> 01:47:23,160
yeah,
they let them,

2738
01:47:23,250 --> 01:47:23,770
I mean,

2739
01:47:23,770 --> 01:47:26,880
who is a testosterone use exemption and 
when he was doing it,

2740
01:47:26,881 --> 01:47:27,590
Holy Shit.

2741
01:47:27,590 --> 01:47:28,880
Yeah.
He looked terrified.

2742
01:47:28,930 --> 01:47:30,960
Yeah.
He looked like 19 year old beach.

2743
01:47:31,330 --> 01:47:32,070
Yeah.

2744
01:47:32,070 --> 01:47:34,290
Crazier than 19 year old.
But he looked like a demon.

2745
01:47:34,720 --> 01:47:36,390
I mean,
Vito would come out and just starch.

2746
01:47:36,391 --> 01:47:37,224
Everybody was smashing people.
We'll kick luke rockhold when we never 

2747
01:47:40,051 --> 01:47:40,884
seen him throw a wheel in his life.
He threw two wheel kicks in his entire 

2748
01:47:43,441 --> 01:47:45,660
career.
Oh look at the pictures of him.

2749
01:47:45,690 --> 01:47:50,690
This is 2007 on the left in 2000 or 2012
and the left and 2017 on the right.

2750
01:47:51,801 --> 01:47:53,160
Yeah.
Fucking a

2751
01:47:53,440 --> 01:47:56,050
that poor guy though.
Can you imagine being on that level?

2752
01:47:56,051 --> 01:47:57,730
I mean you do,
you take testosterone.

2753
01:47:57,760 --> 01:47:58,593
Yeah.
So can you imagine being on that level 

2754
01:47:59,531 --> 01:48:01,540
where you feel like your body is in a 
certain,

2755
01:48:01,541 --> 01:48:02,374
it can perform a certain way and then 
have that taken away from you and then 

2756
01:48:05,680 --> 01:48:06,513
like just having to compete with that 
and then compete with whatever's going 

2757
01:48:08,501 --> 01:48:09,600
on in your mind too?

2758
01:48:09,740 --> 01:48:13,340
Well,
there's the thing is that with youth is,

2759
01:48:13,370 --> 01:48:16,100
you know,
you have all this athletic ability,

2760
01:48:16,101 --> 01:48:16,934
you have all the strength and speed,
but you don't have any experience and 

2761
01:48:19,791 --> 01:48:20,624
wisdom.
And then as you gain experience and 

2762
01:48:21,801 --> 01:48:22,634
wisdom,
father time slowly takes away your 

2763
01:48:24,321 --> 01:48:26,270
physical gifts to the point where you're
trying to,

2764
01:48:26,510 --> 01:48:28,610
like Bernard Hopkins when he fought Joe 
Smith,

2765
01:48:28,880 --> 01:48:31,070
there was that weird moment where you 
realize like,

2766
01:48:31,100 --> 01:48:31,933
oh,
we've passed the point here where your 

2767
01:48:33,891 --> 01:48:34,724
knowledge and your hard work and 
discipline makes up for the fact that 

2768
01:48:37,791 --> 01:48:39,320
your body's deteriorating.
Right.

2769
01:48:39,410 --> 01:48:42,260
Then you're fighting this young bulldog 
who's just an animal.

2770
01:48:42,290 --> 01:48:43,920
He went through the ropes.
Yeah,

2771
01:48:43,990 --> 01:48:45,440
he fell on his head.
It was horrible.

2772
01:48:45,441 --> 01:48:48,860
The meeting really made me think about 
like the way boxing rings are set up.

2773
01:48:48,861 --> 01:48:49,694
Like how the fuck is it?
So easy to fall through the ropes and 

2774
01:48:52,131 --> 01:48:52,964
why or why is there no one there to see 
that happening and catch them like he 

2775
01:48:56,361 --> 01:48:58,850
fell on his head,
didn't know where the fuck he was,

2776
01:48:58,851 --> 01:49:01,310
didn't know what was going on.
So dangerous.

2777
01:49:01,340 --> 01:49:04,400
So dangerous when you get a died there.
The way he fell back to,

2778
01:49:04,401 --> 01:49:05,234
he literally fell head first and landed 
on the ground and I'm assuming it was 

2779
01:49:08,961 --> 01:49:10,040
concrete,
I mean,

2780
01:49:10,790 --> 01:49:11,623
and didn't know what happened.
Didn't know where he was thought he got 

2781
01:49:13,581 --> 01:49:15,920
pushed out of the ring,
didn't know he got knocked out.

2782
01:49:15,950 --> 01:49:17,420
It was just so out of it.
Yeah.

2783
01:49:17,550 --> 01:49:18,383
They,
there comes the time when we have to 

2784
01:49:19,321 --> 01:49:22,650
recognize our mortality and 
unfortunately fighters are not people to

2785
01:49:22,651 --> 01:49:24,520
do that.
Then you look too,

2786
01:49:24,650 --> 01:49:25,250
yeah.

2787
01:49:25,250 --> 01:49:27,230
She didn't have to recognize it for a 
couple of years.

2788
01:49:27,231 --> 01:49:28,940
Yeah.
The turn back the time,

2789
01:49:29,120 --> 01:49:29,953
I mean you went from Vitor Belfort who 
fought rich Franklin Vito Belfort who 

2790
01:49:33,531 --> 01:49:36,350
fought a sexy yama and you know,
you look good.

2791
01:49:36,650 --> 01:49:38,810
But then when he got on the 
testosterone,

2792
01:49:38,811 --> 01:49:40,880
it's like all of a sudden you have the 
phenom,

2793
01:49:41,190 --> 01:49:42,350
this,
this demon

2794
01:49:42,430 --> 01:49:43,263
that,
that a therapeutic use exemption stuff 

2795
01:49:45,831 --> 01:49:48,040
that it seemed to spike a certain time 
for a lot

2796
01:49:48,040 --> 01:49:49,300
of people.
Why is that found out?

2797
01:49:49,301 --> 01:49:51,840
It was legal.
It was a bunch of shitty.

2798
01:49:51,841 --> 01:49:52,730
As doctors.

2799
01:49:53,400 --> 01:49:54,233
I know some people who use some shady 
ass doctors and what the doctor would 

2800
01:49:57,361 --> 01:50:00,690
literally tell them is you take 
testosterone for a short amount of time,

2801
01:50:00,691 --> 01:50:01,950
take a lot of it,
um,

2802
01:50:02,190 --> 01:50:06,000
get your system hooked on it,
then get off of it and then get tested.

2803
01:50:06,150 --> 01:50:07,690
So then they will go,
man,

2804
01:50:07,710 --> 01:50:11,220
just got low testosterone.
It's because your body,

2805
01:50:11,340 --> 01:50:15,750
you jolted it down with like 10 weeks of
high level test and then you say,

2806
01:50:15,780 --> 01:50:19,380
I'm feeling a little run down and maybe 
I have something wrong with me.

2807
01:50:19,381 --> 01:50:20,214
I have a medical condition.
It's like a lot of it was just guys who 

2808
01:50:22,231 --> 01:50:27,231
take steroids and their body had stopped
producing it naturally and then they got

2809
01:50:28,081 --> 01:50:28,914
a therapeutic use exemption and they 
were shooting it up all the time and 

2810
01:50:30,691 --> 01:50:32,640
then they were going in there and 
they're 27 years old.

2811
01:50:32,640 --> 01:50:37,380
So the benefits of the previous steroid 
use didn't linger to the point that,

2812
01:50:37,410 --> 01:50:39,300
or was it a mental thing?
Well,

2813
01:50:39,330 --> 01:50:40,890
the benefits there,
if they,

2814
01:50:40,950 --> 01:50:41,910
if their endocrine system

2815
01:50:42,020 --> 01:50:42,853
caught up,
say say if they did a certain amount of 

2816
01:50:44,361 --> 01:50:47,180
cycles and they gained a certain amount 
of strength there,

2817
01:50:47,210 --> 01:50:48,043
they would come.
They would keep some of that benefit 

2818
01:50:49,670 --> 01:50:52,910
permanently.
But when their end to consistent crashed

2819
01:50:52,911 --> 01:50:54,950
because they had taken all the stores 
and then they got off of it,

2820
01:50:54,980 --> 01:50:58,310
that's when they can test and the test 
shows low testosterone.

2821
01:50:58,400 --> 01:51:00,250
That's all they needed to show.
They didn't,

2822
01:51:00,270 --> 01:51:00,660
didn't need.

2823
01:51:00,660 --> 01:51:01,493
She could still physically perform to a 
higher level than they could have if 

2824
01:51:03,591 --> 01:51:05,270
they've never done steroids in the first
place

2825
01:51:05,340 --> 01:51:08,070
probably.
But while they're at a low testosterone,

2826
01:51:08,071 --> 01:51:08,904
they're gonna experience very 
significant decreases in endurance and 

2827
01:51:11,311 --> 01:51:13,410
stamina and your,
your intensity,

2828
01:51:13,560 --> 01:51:16,740
all that's going to be down.
Your body's like really depressed.

2829
01:51:17,070 --> 01:51:17,903
Like that's one of the things that 
happens to men when they get head 

2830
01:51:19,771 --> 01:51:20,604
injuries is that head injuries and 
traumatic brain injuries cause a 

2831
01:51:23,491 --> 01:51:24,324
disruption in the pituitary gland,
which causes your body to produce less 

2832
01:51:26,761 --> 01:51:30,450
testosterone,
which oftentimes leads to soldiers,

2833
01:51:30,451 --> 01:51:33,180
football players,
fighters becoming severely depressed and

2834
01:51:33,181 --> 01:51:36,660
oftentimes they lane towards alcoholism 
and drug addiction.

2835
01:51:36,661 --> 01:51:38,850
And a lot of that is trying to combat 
that depression.

2836
01:51:38,940 --> 01:51:41,490
I actually,
that that makes a great deal of sense.

2837
01:51:41,491 --> 01:51:43,500
I was never tested to the extent of 
this,

2838
01:51:43,501 --> 01:51:44,700
but when I,
when I quit fighting,

2839
01:51:44,701 --> 01:51:45,534
I was put on estrogen because I have a 
really messed up reproductive system 

2840
01:51:48,511 --> 01:51:50,370
from,
I don't know if I was like,

2841
01:51:50,580 --> 01:51:53,640
it's,
I have polycystic ovarian syndrome,

2842
01:51:54,060 --> 01:51:55,220
which it,
it's anyway,

2843
01:51:55,230 --> 01:51:56,063
whatever it is.
I was put on a birth control pill with 

2844
01:51:57,121 --> 01:52:00,990
very high estrogen and that led me to 
have to go on antidepressants,

2845
01:52:01,110 --> 01:52:02,670
which led me have to go into this,
which I mean it,

2846
01:52:02,671 --> 01:52:03,504
yeah,
it was just the amount of estrogen 

2847
01:52:04,650 --> 01:52:05,610
leads.
You do what?

2848
01:52:05,620 --> 01:52:08,870
I wanted to have babies really badly and
um,

2849
01:52:09,030 --> 01:52:12,990
I had horrible not to be,
to put whatever we're talking about.

2850
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:14,220
Everything.
While I was,

2851
01:52:14,370 --> 01:52:15,860
while I was fighting,
I um,

2852
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:16,833
I had horrible periods.
Like I would have periods for an entire 

2853
01:52:20,310 --> 01:52:21,450
month and stuff like that while I was 
fighting.

2854
01:52:21,450 --> 01:52:22,283
Yeah.
Like when my body fat lowered for 

2855
01:52:23,461 --> 01:52:24,480
whatever reason,
you know,

2856
01:52:24,481 --> 01:52:27,410
women are supposed to stop and they,
they're supposed to intern men or it,

2857
01:52:27,420 --> 01:52:29,820
you know,
but for me it was different and I would,

2858
01:52:29,850 --> 01:52:31,380
I was just like,
I was bleeding all the time.

2859
01:52:31,381 --> 01:52:33,630
Like it was a,
it was a long 10 years,

2860
01:52:34,170 --> 01:52:34,831
but he's just like,
I,

2861
01:52:34,831 --> 01:52:36,300
you know,
like my body was really,

2862
01:52:36,301 --> 01:52:37,134
really weird.
And so when I stopped fighting I was 

2863
01:52:38,671 --> 01:52:39,240
like,
I was,

2864
01:52:39,240 --> 01:52:41,070
I was sick of being in pain.
I was sick of this and that.

2865
01:52:41,071 --> 01:52:42,240
I was like,
I don't have to.

2866
01:52:42,241 --> 01:52:43,074
Um,
I didn't want to put any chemicals into 

2867
01:52:44,881 --> 01:52:45,950
my,
when I was fighting,

2868
01:52:46,460 --> 01:52:49,130
I was really worried about that,
like worried about if that would make me

2869
01:52:49,131 --> 01:52:51,530
gain weight if I went on the birth 
control pill or something like that,

2870
01:52:51,531 --> 01:52:53,120
you know?
So when I quit fighting,

2871
01:52:53,121 --> 01:52:53,954
you know,
I went to a gynecologist and she put me 

2872
01:52:54,621 --> 01:52:56,120
on it and then it just,
I crashed,

2873
01:52:56,300 --> 01:52:58,190
I don't know which birth control pill it
was,

2874
01:52:58,191 --> 01:52:59,024
but I was severely depressed when I quit
fighting the birth control pills cause 

2875
01:53:02,121 --> 01:53:03,690
depression irregulated regulated.

2876
01:53:03,710 --> 01:53:04,543
I don't know if eight caused depression,
but I would say that the changing 

2877
01:53:06,201 --> 01:53:08,960
chemicals in my body post fight so I 
could,

2878
01:53:08,970 --> 01:53:10,580
you can't just say it's like this one 
thing,

2879
01:53:10,581 --> 01:53:12,410
but I would say heightened estrogen 
probably.

2880
01:53:12,620 --> 01:53:15,020
I was all of a sudden eating carbs again
for the first time and for,

2881
01:53:15,021 --> 01:53:16,880
you know what I mean?
A lot of things were different.

2882
01:53:17,150 --> 01:53:19,520
I wasn't exercising however many hours a
day.

2883
01:53:19,880 --> 01:53:21,650
Everything in my life was different.
But I will say,

2884
01:53:21,651 --> 01:53:22,484
you know,
I put on 30 pounds within six months of 

2885
01:53:24,501 --> 01:53:26,010
retiring like it.
Yeah,

2886
01:53:26,020 --> 01:53:26,721
it was insane.
I mean,

2887
01:53:26,721 --> 01:53:28,490
I have breasts zone,
which is a great thing,

2888
01:53:28,491 --> 01:53:30,500
but it wasn't something I was used to 
for a decade.

2889
01:53:30,920 --> 01:53:32,420
And um,
you know,

2890
01:53:32,450 --> 01:53:36,230
it's um,
it's so funny about how when your,

2891
01:53:36,231 --> 01:53:39,050
your reproductive chemicals or when all 
that gets messed up,

2892
01:53:39,260 --> 01:53:40,850
how that actually messes with your brain
as well.

2893
01:53:41,150 --> 01:53:44,150
Because I can understand these men 
coming off of of head injuries.

2894
01:53:44,151 --> 01:53:44,984
If they're having a decreased like a 
chemical like testosterone or whatever 

2895
01:53:48,801 --> 01:53:49,634
it is,
I can understand that actual weirdness 

2896
01:53:53,030 --> 01:53:57,500
like taking part and that affecting 
their brains severely in the shutdown of

2897
01:53:57,530 --> 01:54:01,010
the steroid cycles is a lot of,
Gosh,

2898
01:54:01,060 --> 01:54:03,590
depression.
It's led people to suicide.

2899
01:54:03,980 --> 01:54:06,440
And if you're inclined towards 
depression in the first place,

2900
01:54:06,441 --> 01:54:08,180
I'm sure it probably,
it gets accentuated.

2901
01:54:08,210 --> 01:54:09,043
Oh,
oh yeah.

2902
01:54:09,430 --> 01:54:11,450
There's a big history of depression in 
my family.

2903
01:54:11,451 --> 01:54:13,180
I went through a really rough time.
Um,

2904
01:54:13,610 --> 01:54:14,443
and then remarkably I discovered writing
and that was great and it's led me on a 

2905
01:54:18,891 --> 01:54:20,510
completely different path.
But yeah,

2906
01:54:20,530 --> 01:54:22,460
a post fighting,
there's something about that.

2907
01:54:22,461 --> 01:54:23,330
It's not even,
I mean,

2908
01:54:23,360 --> 01:54:24,193
think the chemicals are a great,
I'm not a doctor and I'm not a 

2909
01:54:26,721 --> 01:54:27,740
scientist.
That's my family.

2910
01:54:27,741 --> 01:54:28,610
They're all scientists and shit.

2911
01:54:28,610 --> 01:54:29,480
I don't,
I don't know any of it.

2912
01:54:29,481 --> 01:54:31,130
Like I don't know the science behind it 
exactly.

2913
01:54:31,430 --> 01:54:32,690
But I will say that,
that,

2914
01:54:32,720 --> 01:54:33,553
um,
I don't know that it's necessarily 

2915
01:54:35,150 --> 01:54:38,120
always chemical.
I think that there's a big part of it.

2916
01:54:38,121 --> 01:54:38,954
It's also purposeful.
I think when you don't have a purpose 

2917
01:54:41,080 --> 01:54:43,220
and you don't have a goal and something 
to strive for,

2918
01:54:43,520 --> 01:54:46,250
then your body reacts to it as well and 
your brain reacts to that as well.

2919
01:54:46,251 --> 01:54:48,080
So I think that as well.
Yeah,

2920
01:54:48,110 --> 01:54:50,090
I think that's something exercise thing 
too.

2921
01:54:50,091 --> 01:54:54,380
I'm sure that played a big factor.
The lack of exercise or the much greatly

2922
01:54:54,381 --> 01:54:55,330
reduced,
you know,

2923
01:54:55,331 --> 01:54:56,720
different,
you can run three miles a day,

2924
01:54:56,721 --> 01:55:00,410
but it's not the same as sparring every 
other day or whatever you're doing.

2925
01:55:00,411 --> 01:55:00,861
Or do,
you know,

2926
01:55:00,861 --> 01:55:02,630
doing Jujitsu twice a day or whatever it
is.

2927
01:55:02,660 --> 01:55:04,880
Yeah.
So much of probably what depression is,

2928
01:55:04,881 --> 01:55:07,640
is so many,
it's just a giant combination of factors

2929
01:55:08,190 --> 01:55:08,810
I think.

2930
01:55:08,810 --> 01:55:09,321
Yeah.
I mean,

2931
01:55:09,321 --> 01:55:09,921
again,
I'm not,

2932
01:55:09,921 --> 01:55:11,420
I'm not as,
I have a great therapist,

2933
01:55:11,421 --> 01:55:12,470
but I'm not,
you know,

2934
01:55:12,471 --> 01:55:14,450
I can't tell you what that is.
I,

2935
01:55:14,480 --> 01:55:16,250
I,
but I can't say that,

2936
01:55:16,251 --> 01:55:20,120
um,
there is something to having all of that

2937
01:55:20,121 --> 01:55:21,500
in balance.
Um,

2938
01:55:21,590 --> 01:55:23,660
having,
being chemically,

2939
01:55:23,661 --> 01:55:24,494
I guess physiologically in balance with 
the way your body's supposed to be and 

2940
01:55:27,201 --> 01:55:28,740
then have your,
um,

2941
01:55:29,120 --> 01:55:29,953
exercise the way it's supposed to be.
And then have your purpose the way it's 

2942
01:55:31,761 --> 01:55:32,594
supposed to be.
And it's such a weird balance as human 

2943
01:55:34,461 --> 01:55:36,740
beings that when any of you have these 
things get thrown out of whack,

2944
01:55:37,530 --> 01:55:40,100
you're headed for trouble and 
friendships,

2945
01:55:40,190 --> 01:55:44,010
family,
all the relationships that you

2946
01:55:44,010 --> 01:55:44,843
keep in your life.
I saw this really interesting clip from 

2947
01:55:46,951 --> 01:55:50,280
this guy and he was talking about is a,
I'm a rapper.

2948
01:55:50,281 --> 01:55:51,114
I think he was,
but he's talking about his mental diet 

2949
01:55:53,520 --> 01:55:54,353
and the way he looked at it.
It's like that people are really 

2950
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:59,280
concentrating constantly about what they
eat,

2951
01:55:59,730 --> 01:56:00,563
but they're not concentrating constantly
about what they take in their mind and 

2952
01:56:04,051 --> 01:56:06,660
that like you should really be aware of 
your mental diet too.

2953
01:56:07,050 --> 01:56:09,750
You know that if you snack on too much 
junk food,

2954
01:56:09,751 --> 01:56:11,670
mentally it will weaken your mind,
you know?

2955
01:56:11,671 --> 01:56:11,900
Like,
yeah,

2956
01:56:11,900 --> 01:56:13,790
that makes sense.
That makes sense.

2957
01:56:13,791 --> 01:56:14,624
Yeah.
I think that we don't push ourselves 

2958
01:56:15,981 --> 01:56:18,500
mentally a lot and when it comes to 
that,

2959
01:56:18,590 --> 01:56:21,160
I think honestly it's just coming down 
to it.

2960
01:56:21,170 --> 01:56:23,150
I mean,
it's not a cure all that reading,

2961
01:56:23,570 --> 01:56:24,403
if you just read,
if you just sit and force yourself to 

2962
01:56:25,941 --> 01:56:28,040
read and you actually engage with 
attacks,

2963
01:56:28,340 --> 01:56:30,530
all of a sudden you realize something is
happening in your brain.

2964
01:56:30,531 --> 01:56:33,530
You're creating space for more thought 
in your brain,

2965
01:56:34,070 --> 01:56:36,890
but also you can't be exposed to too 
much bullshit.

2966
01:56:36,980 --> 01:56:38,720
And who knows what's bullshit and what's
not balls.

2967
01:56:38,721 --> 01:56:39,554
I mean,
there has to be a discernment somewhere 

2968
01:56:40,311 --> 01:56:42,470
along the line,
some sort of like,

2969
01:56:42,680 --> 01:56:43,431
uh,
I guess,

2970
01:56:43,431 --> 01:56:45,380
um,
I don't know.

2971
01:56:45,410 --> 01:56:48,140
Literary consciousness or something like
that where you know that,

2972
01:56:48,350 --> 01:56:49,580
I mean,
I'm addicted to twitter,

2973
01:56:50,240 --> 01:56:51,021
but,
oh,

2974
01:56:51,021 --> 01:56:52,190
I love twitter.
I love it.

2975
01:56:52,520 --> 01:56:56,120
And I know that I'm a giant bitch on 
there and I don't do your,

2976
01:56:56,121 --> 01:56:56,990
I am,
oh,

2977
01:56:56,991 --> 01:56:57,570
you a bitch.

2978
01:56:57,570 --> 01:56:59,270
I'm always telling people to go fuck 
themselves.

2979
01:56:59,300 --> 01:57:02,060
Oh,
it's like game because it's so enjoyable

2980
01:57:02,061 --> 01:57:03,470
to me.
It's like playing a game.

2981
01:57:03,800 --> 01:57:05,740
And I,
you know,

2982
01:57:05,760 --> 01:57:07,550
the part of me is like,
I hate that part of myself,

2983
01:57:07,551 --> 01:57:09,800
but I also really like it because I 
think I'm be coming.

2984
01:57:09,801 --> 01:57:11,550
It's to me,
it's not really,

2985
01:57:11,560 --> 01:57:12,393
I'm not a brand.
There's no Julie Kedsey fighter who has 

2986
01:57:14,091 --> 01:57:16,420
to impress anybody anymore like it.
You know,

2987
01:57:16,430 --> 01:57:18,530
there's a,
granted I represent invicta to a certain

2988
01:57:18,531 --> 01:57:19,364
extent,
but I know I fully understand that 

2989
01:57:21,531 --> 01:57:24,530
Shannon could fire me if I say something
just outrageous and horrible.

2990
01:57:24,531 --> 01:57:25,364
She wouldn't,
she's a wonderful person and I'm no 

2991
01:57:26,661 --> 01:57:28,520
longer at behind the scenes there.
I'm just,

2992
01:57:28,580 --> 01:57:29,413
I'm a commentator.
I'm not somebody making any decisions 

2993
01:57:31,131 --> 01:57:32,240
with the company.
Right.

2994
01:57:32,780 --> 01:57:35,090
But I don't know,
when it comes to twitter,

2995
01:57:35,410 --> 01:57:37,560
what do you do?
You get in flame wars with people.

2996
01:57:38,180 --> 01:57:39,330
Some street shit too.

2997
01:57:39,610 --> 01:57:40,443
Yeah.
I kind of enjoy when people insult me 

2998
01:57:41,681 --> 01:57:42,730
and I go after.
Yeah.

2999
01:57:42,760 --> 01:57:45,280
But I do feel my brain deteriorating a 
little bit when they do that.

3000
01:57:45,310 --> 01:57:46,530
You know?
It was just like I would,

3001
01:57:46,550 --> 01:57:47,430
I,
I know.

3002
01:57:47,431 --> 01:57:47,951
It's just like,
okay,

3003
01:57:47,951 --> 01:57:49,900
I need to stop me to put this down now.
But you know,

3004
01:57:49,901 --> 01:57:51,010
when they come at me and they're just 
like,

3005
01:57:51,011 --> 01:57:52,660
you're a Feminazi your this who I'm just
like,

3006
01:57:52,661 --> 01:57:53,610
yeah,
come on up.

3007
01:57:54,230 --> 01:57:56,770
Feminine.
I'm very outspoken.

3008
01:57:56,771 --> 01:57:57,890
Being a feminist.
I'm very,

3009
01:57:57,910 --> 01:57:59,360
you know,
and when I talk about socialism,

3010
01:57:59,361 --> 01:58:01,450
when I talk about I hate Donald Trump 
and I talk about this,

3011
01:58:01,451 --> 01:58:02,320
you know,
and Yep,

3012
01:58:02,520 --> 01:58:07,160
I would never label you in like you're 
just a genuine person.

3013
01:58:07,180 --> 01:58:10,280
Like who happens to be a woman who 
believes what you believe.

3014
01:58:10,281 --> 01:58:12,290
Like you,
you're not like sexist.

3015
01:58:12,550 --> 01:58:14,400
You're not like anti male or anytime.

3016
01:58:14,930 --> 01:58:15,763
Man,
I,

3017
01:58:15,780 --> 01:58:18,490
I love men,
I believe settle down.

3018
01:58:19,940 --> 01:58:21,360
But the thing is,
um,

3019
01:58:21,620 --> 01:58:25,340
I am pro woman to certain sent me when 
it comes to mma,

3020
01:58:25,341 --> 01:58:26,174
I'm,
I'm more interested in what's going on 

3021
01:58:26,781 --> 01:58:29,630
with women in the sport then with men.
That's just where I'm oriented.

3022
01:58:29,640 --> 01:58:32,180
That's part of your job.
And um,

3023
01:58:32,360 --> 01:58:33,650
but well,
I don't know,

3024
01:58:33,651 --> 01:58:35,000
there's this association though.
First of all,

3025
01:58:35,001 --> 01:58:37,100
the whole Feminazi label is just,
I mean,

3026
01:58:37,101 --> 01:58:38,150
that's the first thing.
Like I said,

3027
01:58:38,360 --> 01:58:39,740
yeah,
I'm really proud to be a feminist.

3028
01:58:39,741 --> 01:58:41,090
And then people are just know that means
you hate,

3029
01:58:41,270 --> 01:58:42,010
you think they're all rapists.

3030
01:58:42,010 --> 01:58:42,550
And I'm like,

3031
01:58:42,550 --> 01:58:45,560
no,
that discredits men so much.

3032
01:58:45,920 --> 01:58:47,840
Like why?
No.

3033
01:58:47,950 --> 01:58:48,741
Well,
it's silly.

3034
01:58:48,741 --> 01:58:52,640
And that though the term feminist has 
been so cooptive by negative thoughts.

3035
01:58:53,090 --> 01:58:55,760
So many people have this negative 
connotation they attached to it,

3036
01:58:55,790 --> 01:58:57,030
of course,
and its movements that,

3037
01:58:57,031 --> 01:58:57,864
you know,
third wave feminist and this and you 

3038
01:58:58,461 --> 01:58:59,294
know,
there's certain when whenever the real 

3039
01:59:01,250 --> 01:59:02,990
fucking problem,
male feminists,

3040
01:59:03,020 --> 01:59:03,853
they've ruined it.
Those fucking twats men ruin everything 

3041
01:59:08,210 --> 01:59:09,140
they've read even ruined.

3042
01:59:10,730 --> 01:59:11,561
That's funny.
I know,

3043
01:59:11,561 --> 01:59:12,394
I know Jamie was on here and he was a 
friend of mine and something weird 

3044
01:59:14,061 --> 01:59:14,894
happened with that guy.
I don't know what's going on with his 

3045
01:59:16,161 --> 01:59:16,994
life right now that I don't know what 
Scott and I don't want it like 

3046
01:59:20,390 --> 01:59:21,260
speculate,
any of that.

3047
01:59:21,261 --> 01:59:23,030
But we were really good friends for a 
while and you know,

3048
01:59:23,300 --> 01:59:28,040
I know his like he was very disliked as 
a male feminist,

3049
01:59:28,041 --> 01:59:28,860
quote unquote male.

3050
01:59:28,860 --> 01:59:32,940
Well it's because everybody thought that
he was what he just got accused of being

3051
01:59:33,300 --> 01:59:36,300
right and they're just coonhounds that 
are taking that angle.

3052
01:59:37,840 --> 01:59:41,820
That is an interesting track.
Honestly think sometimes people are just

3053
01:59:42,780 --> 01:59:44,160
assholes who want sex.

3054
01:59:44,310 --> 01:59:46,680
And I also think sometimes people are 
manipulative assholes who want sex.

3055
01:59:46,681 --> 01:59:48,150
I don't see him as a manipulative 
person,

3056
01:59:48,180 --> 01:59:51,660
but again,
I might probably not,

3057
01:59:51,661 --> 01:59:53,370
I didn't interact.
Yeah,

3058
01:59:53,890 --> 01:59:55,090
I don't know either.
You know,

3059
01:59:55,120 --> 01:59:55,953
I don't,
I think people are a bunch of different 

3060
01:59:56,861 --> 01:59:59,200
things depending on who they are,
what time of the day.

3061
01:59:59,680 --> 02:00:00,513
I think it'd be nice if the whole world 
was egalitarianism and if we all looked 

3062
02:00:03,941 --> 02:00:06,190
at people as just treating them,

3063
02:00:07,350 --> 02:00:08,183
who they are based on their character 
and their personality and not 

3064
02:00:11,161 --> 02:00:13,260
categorizing them.
So specifically like,

3065
02:00:13,290 --> 02:00:16,480
oh you are a woman so you are less or 
you are a man and you are moving

3066
02:00:16,540 --> 02:00:17,760
or,
or vice averse,

3067
02:00:17,940 --> 02:00:19,070
a male feminist.
And I'm like,

3068
02:00:19,071 --> 02:00:19,771
that's the problem.
I mean,

3069
02:00:19,771 --> 02:00:24,771
are you joking when you say no?
I mean,

3070
02:00:26,390 --> 02:00:26,640
yeah,

3071
02:00:26,640 --> 02:00:27,370
it's,
it's,

3072
02:00:27,370 --> 02:00:28,203
the problem is there's a lot of people 
that virtue signal and a lot of people 

3073
02:00:31,361 --> 02:00:32,194
that are posturing and a lot of people 
that are putting a label on themselves 

3074
02:00:34,811 --> 02:00:35,644
to try to make themselves seem like 
they're in a higher moral high ground 

3075
02:00:38,260 --> 02:00:41,290
than the rest of the folks around them.
And that's the motivation for doing it.

3076
02:00:41,500 --> 02:00:43,660
That becomes transparent and people get 
angry at that.

3077
02:00:43,661 --> 02:00:44,494
They recognize what it is,
so when someone like Jamie Kilstein 

3078
02:00:46,571 --> 02:00:48,850
slips up after all these years of 
virtual signaling,

3079
02:00:49,060 --> 02:00:49,841
they're like,
ah,

3080
02:00:49,841 --> 02:00:51,190
I knew it.
You fuck,

3081
02:00:51,670 --> 02:00:54,470
here's that.
Does that really negate some of the good

3082
02:00:54,471 --> 02:00:56,750
things that he's done?
If he's influenced some men?

3083
02:00:56,780 --> 02:00:58,970
I don't know the virtue.
I guess one of the good things,

3084
02:00:59,030 --> 02:01:01,130
I don't know if he's maybe said,
oh,

3085
02:01:01,160 --> 02:01:02,810
hey,
a woman is actually a person.

3086
02:01:03,130 --> 02:01:03,963
Yeah,
it's well,

3087
02:01:04,010 --> 02:01:04,843
absolutely full.
The fuck doesn't think a woman as a 

3088
02:01:06,231 --> 02:01:07,064
person.

3089
02:01:07,770 --> 02:01:10,230
Twitter timeline,
those people,

3090
02:01:10,320 --> 02:01:11,153
if there's a person out there that 
doesn't think that a woman's a person 

3091
02:01:13,380 --> 02:01:15,870
fucking Jamie Kilstein is not going to 
change their opinion.

3092
02:01:15,900 --> 02:01:16,733
It's just going to,
he's just going to broadcast it and let 

3093
02:01:18,781 --> 02:01:19,614
everybody know that's how he thinks and 
he's going to get all this love and 

3094
02:01:22,111 --> 02:01:22,944
people are going to send them all these 
likes and they're going to give them a 

3095
02:01:24,560 --> 02:01:28,510
thumbs up and say nice things to him on 
twitter and that may

3096
02:01:28,510 --> 02:01:31,720
or may not be a good thing.
It's more a good thing that a bad thing.

3097
02:01:31,721 --> 02:01:33,460
It's not a bad thing,
but you're not going to change.

3098
02:01:33,461 --> 02:01:36,430
Some asshole opinion saying something 
like that.

3099
02:01:36,431 --> 02:01:37,860
I don't know that you are,
but I,

3100
02:01:37,861 --> 02:01:40,040
I don't know.
Have you changed any assholes

3101
02:01:40,040 --> 02:01:42,530
opinion with any group things that if 
you've come out and said something,

3102
02:01:42,531 --> 02:01:43,364
have you,
do you think you've changed people's 

3103
02:01:44,331 --> 02:01:44,740
opinions?

3104
02:01:44,740 --> 02:01:49,640
I think things change if they value what
you're saying,

3105
02:01:49,670 --> 02:01:50,503
if they believe that you're being 
truthful and if what you're saying is 

3106
02:01:53,331 --> 02:01:56,000
compelling enough for them to reconsider
the way they look at things,

3107
02:01:56,480 --> 02:01:57,313
it is possible,
but it's not 100% and that's not the 

3108
02:02:00,501 --> 02:02:02,300
motivation behind doing things in the 
first place.

3109
02:02:02,301 --> 02:02:03,134
I'm not trying,
I don't ever try to change people's 

3110
02:02:04,641 --> 02:02:05,474
opinions,
but I do try to express myself as 

3111
02:02:06,921 --> 02:02:10,430
cleanly and as accurately and as 
honestly as I can.

3112
02:02:10,700 --> 02:02:13,730
And I think that in my opinion,
in my experience,

3113
02:02:13,880 --> 02:02:16,400
when I've heard people like you talking 
about your life,

3114
02:02:16,401 --> 02:02:18,500
like you just talking about your life in
this podcast,

3115
02:02:18,800 --> 02:02:23,690
I take that in and I know it's pure and 
it'll make me consider every little,

3116
02:02:24,190 --> 02:02:26,600
every thing that a person says.
Every sentence,

3117
02:02:26,870 --> 02:02:27,703
every conversation that you have with 
someone where they're being real with 

3118
02:02:30,141 --> 02:02:30,974
you,
it adds more knowledge to your database 

3119
02:02:34,041 --> 02:02:36,470
of human interaction and the way people 
behave and think.

3120
02:02:36,740 --> 02:02:37,573
Now thinking that way,
it does slowly make you consider more 

3121
02:02:40,011 --> 02:02:40,844
things about people and that adds to the
overall surface area of knowledge that 

3122
02:02:44,961 --> 02:02:46,310
you have about people in general.

3123
02:02:46,350 --> 02:02:47,183
I absolutely do.
You in your position because you have 

3124
02:02:49,941 --> 02:02:53,840
considerable influence.
Do you worry about having people kind of

3125
02:02:53,841 --> 02:02:55,580
latch on things,
hive minded and,

3126
02:02:55,581 --> 02:02:56,414
and,
and go a direction that you feel a 

3127
02:02:57,531 --> 02:02:58,890
responsibility I guess to people,

3128
02:02:59,000 --> 02:02:59,833
but definitely feel responsibility and 
not manipulating them and it definitely 

3129
02:03:02,331 --> 02:03:03,164
feel responsibility and not taking 
advantage of that and not starting a 

3130
02:03:05,751 --> 02:03:07,300
cult or something like that.
Yeah.

3131
02:03:07,700 --> 02:03:08,533
Yeah.
I mean,

3132
02:03:08,630 --> 02:03:09,463
but it's,
the good part about it is if you don't 

3133
02:03:12,021 --> 02:03:12,854
need anything from anybody,
like you're not trying to get people to 

3134
02:03:15,921 --> 02:03:18,860
send you $50 a month for the fucking,
you know,

3135
02:03:18,861 --> 02:03:23,210
platinum plan where you got access to 
the secret messages,

3136
02:03:23,690 --> 02:03:25,310
l Ron Hubbard or whatever.
Yeah.

3137
02:03:25,500 --> 02:03:26,333
But you know what I mean?
It's like you can take advantage of 

3138
02:03:27,831 --> 02:03:31,470
people in certain ways and I think that 
the,

3139
02:03:31,690 --> 02:03:32,523
that's a,
that's a real issue with any sort of 

3140
02:03:33,531 --> 02:03:35,000
hive mind thinking.
Right?

3141
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:37,290
Yeah.
I don't know where I get,

3142
02:03:37,291 --> 02:03:38,390
I this,
this is fascinating.

3143
02:03:38,391 --> 02:03:39,224
I,
I guess religion and things like that 

3144
02:03:40,761 --> 02:03:43,250
always troubled me and,
and that hive mind mentality that,

3145
02:03:43,251 --> 02:03:43,760
that,
that,

3146
02:03:43,760 --> 02:03:46,070
that troubles me.
It troubles me that,

3147
02:03:46,370 --> 02:03:47,203
I mean to be honest,
it troubles me that Alex Jones was on 

3148
02:03:49,281 --> 02:03:51,590
hair or somebody who,
who kind of leads that sort of thing.

3149
02:03:51,610 --> 02:03:52,443
Yes.
But

3150
02:03:52,770 --> 02:03:53,603
when Alex Jones is on here,
I think people got to understand Alice 

3151
02:03:55,770 --> 02:03:56,603
Jones way more after me getting him 
drunk and stoned and have a talk about 

3152
02:03:59,011 --> 02:04:01,830
interdimensional child molesters.
Like you get to see a chair like,

3153
02:04:01,860 --> 02:04:06,860
oh this is kind of like half wacky show 
or he's also commenting on the craziness

3154
02:04:07,471 --> 02:04:10,080
of the world.
But you got to see who he really is.

3155
02:04:10,081 --> 02:04:10,914
What I,
the guy that I've known for almost 20 

3156
02:04:12,091 --> 02:04:13,920
years,
like that's what I wanted to do.

3157
02:04:13,921 --> 02:04:15,210
By having them on,
like people are like,

3158
02:04:15,211 --> 02:04:16,260
why are you friends with that guy?
I'm like,

3159
02:04:16,800 --> 02:04:18,450
watch,
watch what happens.

3160
02:04:18,451 --> 02:04:20,370
We'll get them fucked up.
We're going to have some fun.

3161
02:04:20,540 --> 02:04:22,020
And you realize like,
oh,

3162
02:04:22,021 --> 02:04:23,910
this guy's like,
he's kind of wacky.

3163
02:04:23,911 --> 02:04:26,460
Like half of what he's doing is almost 
like a show.

3164
02:04:26,550 --> 02:04:27,383
Right?
Well it's like isn't it is and that's 

3165
02:04:30,361 --> 02:04:31,194
kind of him.

3166
02:04:31,350 --> 02:04:33,570
People are buying into that,

3167
02:04:33,920 --> 02:04:36,950
but what are they buying into that's 
false and what are they buying into?

3168
02:04:36,960 --> 02:04:37,793
That's true.
Unfortunately a lot of what Alex Jones 

3169
02:04:40,501 --> 02:04:42,990
has been presenting over these years is 
actually true.

3170
02:04:43,860 --> 02:04:47,460
Like agent provocateurs.
Like when they have peaceful protest,

3171
02:04:47,461 --> 02:04:48,294
they'll send in people to smash windows 
and they're wearing government issue 

3172
02:04:50,911 --> 02:04:51,744
boots and they get rounded up and they 
don't wind up being prosecuted because 

3173
02:04:55,261 --> 02:04:58,980
they were literally brought in by the 
police to turn a peaceful protest into a

3174
02:04:58,981 --> 02:04:59,814
violent protest.
Like the people that took over occupy 

3175
02:05:02,611 --> 02:05:07,170
Wall Street and undercover cops that 
were doing all this fucking crazy,

3176
02:05:07,171 --> 02:05:08,004
chaotic,
violent shit to get people to move in 

3177
02:05:10,740 --> 02:05:14,430
and break up these camps and break up 
these protests when they were all legal.

3178
02:05:14,640 --> 02:05:16,060
Alex Jones sort of expose all that

3179
02:05:16,350 --> 02:05:18,990
first puts his support and I don't want 
to be,

3180
02:05:19,110 --> 02:05:20,750
I actually don't want to be in this 
word.

3181
02:05:20,770 --> 02:05:22,620
I'm not trying to be controversial,
honestly.

3182
02:05:22,621 --> 02:05:23,431
I'm just like,
no,

3183
02:05:23,431 --> 02:05:24,264
it's all conversation expression.
When he puts his support behind people 

3184
02:05:26,971 --> 02:05:27,804
like Donald Trump,
who is actually pushing these sorts of 

3185
02:05:29,731 --> 02:05:34,080
agendas,
what sorts of the anti protesting,

3186
02:05:34,081 --> 02:05:34,914
like trying to change the law so that 
you can run over protesters when there 

3187
02:05:36,940 --> 02:05:37,773
peacefully protest and things like that.
I don't know that he's changing the 

3188
02:05:39,841 --> 02:05:41,190
laws,
but these things are coming up.

3189
02:05:41,540 --> 02:05:42,770
What does that,
it's something a,

3190
02:05:42,771 --> 02:05:45,150
it's Wisconsin or Michigan.
There's something like that.

3191
02:05:45,151 --> 02:05:48,660
They're trying to put a thing in two 
states at whatever it is.

3192
02:05:48,690 --> 02:05:49,501
Yeah,
I know and I,

3193
02:05:49,501 --> 02:05:50,334
I'm so bad because when I follow my 
train of thought and I can never have 

3194
02:05:52,651 --> 02:05:53,484
citations and it drives me bananas 
because I don't want to present 

3195
02:05:55,051 --> 02:05:56,850
information as speculation.

3196
02:05:57,840 --> 02:06:01,180
The people are trying to stop people 
from violating other people's rights.

3197
02:06:01,250 --> 02:06:02,083
Right.
But is a person's right to drive a car 

3198
02:06:03,621 --> 02:06:04,454
down the street more important than a 
person's right to express themselves by 

3199
02:06:06,591 --> 02:06:09,140
saying,
I don't want this to happen.

3200
02:06:09,141 --> 02:06:13,250
I am willfully challenging the law right
here in a peaceful way,

3201
02:06:13,830 --> 02:06:14,663
but it's not peaceful.
If your GRANDPA's dying and you need to 

3202
02:06:16,501 --> 02:06:17,334
get to the hospital and some asshole 
wants to stand in front of him with a 

3203
02:06:18,871 --> 02:06:20,430
macrame hat on with a,
you know,

3204
02:06:20,431 --> 02:06:21,630
I'm a male feminist sign.

3205
02:06:21,770 --> 02:06:24,650
Right.
What instance are you quoting?

3206
02:06:24,651 --> 02:06:26,570
Split.
We've been talking about blocking people

3207
02:06:26,571 --> 02:06:28,160
on the road.
It doesn't help anyone.

3208
02:06:28,190 --> 02:06:29,120
No,
it doesn't help anybody.

3209
02:06:29,121 --> 02:06:29,954
I mean,
I've been arrested for political 

3210
02:06:30,621 --> 02:06:31,454
protests before and I was very aware.
I was crossing a line on to here I was 

3211
02:06:35,091 --> 02:06:36,740
doing something.
I was going to be arrested for it,

3212
02:06:36,741 --> 02:06:37,574
but it was the voices behind me and the 
collective voices together that we're 

3213
02:06:40,551 --> 02:06:43,250
doing something not knowing that they 
were going to be arrested.

3214
02:06:43,251 --> 02:06:44,084
Knowing that the part about going to 
jail and being able to write about or 

3215
02:06:46,221 --> 02:06:48,890
being able to understand that you were 
taking a stance on something.

3216
02:06:48,891 --> 02:06:51,380
You're just trying to bring attention to
something that you think is wrong.

3217
02:06:51,400 --> 02:06:52,400
Well,
what were you arrested for?

3218
02:06:52,460 --> 02:06:53,293
Oh,
it was many years ago and all the 

3219
02:06:53,961 --> 02:06:56,390
military guys already hate me,
but it was the school of the Americas.

3220
02:06:56,390 --> 02:06:59,090
I was 18.
I got arrested twice,

3221
02:06:59,210 --> 02:07:01,020
18 or 19.
Um,

3222
02:07:01,100 --> 02:07:02,510
it was a school of the Americas when 
they were,

3223
02:07:02,540 --> 02:07:04,820
they were teaching the counterinsurgency
techniques,

3224
02:07:05,400 --> 02:07:06,290
um,
down at Fort Benning,

3225
02:07:06,291 --> 02:07:08,270
Georgia.
I'm banned for life there,

3226
02:07:08,450 --> 02:07:11,060
but it was very religious.
Then I was very into social justice.

3227
02:07:11,061 --> 02:07:11,894
I was really like,
I want it to be a nun and I wanted to 

3228
02:07:13,281 --> 02:07:16,460
change the world and I wanted people to 
not kill each other anymore.

3229
02:07:16,670 --> 02:07:17,503
And I wanted us not to fund a military 
groups in South America who were 

3230
02:07:20,781 --> 02:07:24,050
slaughtering people at the same time.
It was protesting.

3231
02:07:24,051 --> 02:07:26,510
I was stepping deliberately onto a 
military base and saying,

3232
02:07:26,720 --> 02:07:28,100
no,
I don't want this to happen anymore.

3233
02:07:28,101 --> 02:07:29,270
I'm peaceful.
You're gonna go with you.

3234
02:07:29,271 --> 02:07:30,320
I,
you're arresting me.

3235
02:07:30,321 --> 02:07:32,720
I know my rights and the,
and the soldiers.

3236
02:07:32,810 --> 02:07:32,990
Let's

3237
02:07:32,990 --> 02:07:36,130
unpack that because what you did there 
was,

3238
02:07:36,160 --> 02:07:39,340
you made a up,
there's a political protest.

3239
02:07:39,370 --> 02:07:40,203
You went to the scene of where you think
these terrible things are taking place 

3240
02:07:43,751 --> 02:07:44,584
and you took a stand knowing you were 
going to get arrested and that it was 

3241
02:07:46,421 --> 02:07:48,240
going to bring media attention to this 
[inaudible].

3242
02:07:48,610 --> 02:07:49,443
There's a big difference between that 
and you deciding we're going to block 

3243
02:07:51,971 --> 02:07:54,280
the one oh one because black lives 
matter,

3244
02:07:54,790 --> 02:07:55,623
you know,
that doesn't have anything to do with 

3245
02:07:56,441 --> 02:07:58,180
all those people that were driving to 
work.

3246
02:07:58,210 --> 02:08:01,870
You're violating their rights to pass.
You're violating their space.

3247
02:08:01,990 --> 02:08:02,823
You're stopping them from being able to 
move freely and a lot of them are 

3248
02:08:05,621 --> 02:08:06,454
private deal of attention to it,
but you're doing it in a way that 

3249
02:08:08,891 --> 02:08:12,490
inconveniences and puts people in danger
and it's not necessary.

3250
02:08:12,520 --> 02:08:13,353
You can do it in a public space.
You could do it in places where you're 

3251
02:08:15,161 --> 02:08:15,994
allowed to protest.

3252
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:16,833
You can do it and you could still get 
your voice out and still get your 

3253
02:08:19,541 --> 02:08:22,390
message out and not block traffic on the
highway.

3254
02:08:22,600 --> 02:08:23,433
The blocking traffic on the highways,
attention horing and it's attention 

3255
02:08:25,841 --> 02:08:26,674
whoring in a very dangerous way because 
you are stopping people from getting to 

3256
02:08:30,581 --> 02:08:31,414
medication.
You're stopping people from getting 

3257
02:08:32,561 --> 02:08:33,394
medical treatment.
Your people can be in the middle of 

3258
02:08:34,961 --> 02:08:37,270
giving birth.
There's a lot of shit that happens.

3259
02:08:37,271 --> 02:08:39,610
We you,
you fuck with people's ability to travel

3260
02:08:39,790 --> 02:08:41,500
and move around,
we rely on that.

3261
02:08:41,501 --> 02:08:45,820
It's extremely significant.
So when you just decide that you know,

3262
02:08:45,821 --> 02:08:46,720
you,
whatever,

3263
02:08:46,721 --> 02:08:48,730
I want transgender rights for the 
bathroom,

3264
02:08:48,731 --> 02:08:49,564
let's Bach this fucking highway.
Just because you think you can get 

3265
02:08:52,091 --> 02:08:55,030
attention doing something like that 
doesn't mean it's the right thing to do.

3266
02:08:55,240 --> 02:08:56,073
There are ways to get attention doing 
things that are lawful and there's ways 

3267
02:08:58,571 --> 02:09:02,140
that are noble and then there's blocking
the fucking highway like a baby.

3268
02:09:02,210 --> 02:09:04,390
Are they still working though?
I'm not just talking about the highway.

3269
02:09:04,391 --> 02:09:07,880
The are are,
are bringing attention to things.

3270
02:09:07,881 --> 02:09:11,420
I mean is that still working the Dakota 
pipeline and stuff like that when people

3271
02:09:11,421 --> 02:09:13,970
were protesting in a peaceful way,
did it shut it down?

3272
02:09:13,971 --> 02:09:15,110
Shut it down.
But it just,

3273
02:09:15,370 --> 02:09:17,670
I mean it's bad for sas change.
It's not,

3274
02:09:17,700 --> 02:09:19,670
and I don't even know if that's the best
example of it.

3275
02:09:19,690 --> 02:09:20,720
And then I'm a good example

3276
02:09:20,750 --> 02:09:23,690
because it was peaceful protesting and 
it did get a lot of attention,

3277
02:09:23,691 --> 02:09:25,700
including me and a lot of other people 
who protest,

3278
02:09:25,740 --> 02:09:26,573
who tweeted about it and put a blinks 
about it and let people know about and 

3279
02:09:29,421 --> 02:09:31,130
talked about it on the podcast.
Yeah,

3280
02:09:31,131 --> 02:09:32,620
I mean it does get attention

3281
02:09:32,820 --> 02:09:37,140
when the tower hit.
I understand what you're saying.

3282
02:09:38,040 --> 02:09:39,480
Yeah.
Protesting.

3283
02:09:39,520 --> 02:09:40,353
They're disregarding what you're saying 
about the highways and stuff like that 

3284
02:09:44,371 --> 02:09:45,204
because that wouldn't be the kind of 
protest that I would want it to be a 

3285
02:09:46,951 --> 02:09:48,600
part of this not the kind of thing I 
would want to enact.

3286
02:09:48,810 --> 02:09:51,090
Now did I believe in that?
Do I believe that the black lives matter

3287
02:09:51,091 --> 02:09:51,511
movement?
Yes,

3288
02:09:51,511 --> 02:09:52,344
to a certain extent.
I also believe in police officer 

3289
02:09:54,661 --> 02:09:58,410
training and better training for police 
officers and those in situations of high

3290
02:09:58,411 --> 02:09:59,244
stress.
I think that there's so much nuance to 

3291
02:10:01,051 --> 02:10:01,884
what's going on there and there's so 
much carried on and and the the highway 

3292
02:10:05,221 --> 02:10:07,440
blocking and the stuff like that.
You're giving very,

3293
02:10:07,441 --> 02:10:11,310
very good counter arguments to,
to this,

3294
02:10:11,311 --> 02:10:12,144
but I will say that there's also 
something in effect when you can make 

3295
02:10:15,151 --> 02:10:19,770
the loudest noise and you know something
is wrong,

3296
02:10:20,100 --> 02:10:20,933
isn't it?
Your responsibility to try and fix 

3297
02:10:21,961 --> 02:10:23,940
things,
not by stopping the highway.

3298
02:10:24,240 --> 02:10:25,590
Maybe not.
Maybe not.

3299
02:10:25,591 --> 02:10:26,910
Maybe it's not.
So by stopping the highway,

3300
02:10:26,911 --> 02:10:29,640
but if people are so determined to be 
against what you're saying,

3301
02:10:29,820 --> 02:10:33,860
there's so in rooted you people have to 
make noise in the strangest ways.

3302
02:10:33,861 --> 02:10:34,830
They have to do what

3303
02:10:34,950 --> 02:10:35,783
people are very self righteous and they 
think that you have to listen to them 

3304
02:10:38,101 --> 02:10:39,470
and you don't want to listen to them.
No,

3305
02:10:39,471 --> 02:10:42,090
you don't.
Your right as an American to not have to

3306
02:10:42,091 --> 02:10:45,300
listen to someone's protest as much as 
it's your right as an American,

3307
02:10:45,301 --> 02:10:47,790
a protest.
You can't force someone to listen to you

3308
02:10:47,791 --> 02:10:48,624
because you think you're right and 
that's what you're doing by standing in 

3309
02:10:50,581 --> 02:10:52,590
front of someone on the highway in 
blocking their passage.

3310
02:10:52,730 --> 02:10:54,560
Okay.
But getting beyond the highway thing,

3311
02:10:54,561 --> 02:10:56,180
because again,
what you're bringing on,

3312
02:10:56,181 --> 02:10:57,310
did I have an issue with,
okay.

3313
02:10:57,400 --> 02:10:57,810
Okay.

3314
02:10:57,810 --> 02:10:58,643
We literally,
I have no problem with protesting I 

3315
02:10:59,881 --> 02:11:00,714
think,
but when you're protesting on the 

3316
02:11:01,321 --> 02:11:03,670
highway and you're blocking traffic,
you're a cunt.

3317
02:11:04,080 --> 02:11:05,410
I mean,
that's a shitty way to do it.

3318
02:11:05,420 --> 02:11:05,640
Right?

3319
02:11:05,640 --> 02:11:06,473
I,
I cannot disagree with you to a certain 

3320
02:11:08,551 --> 02:11:09,384
extent where it is a very inconvenient 
thing and it can be a dangerous thing 

3321
02:11:11,551 --> 02:11:14,700
and I don't think any protesting should 
endanger peoples lives at all.

3322
02:11:14,760 --> 02:11:15,593
By the way,
don't hate marathons too for the same 

3323
02:11:16,681 --> 02:11:18,430
reason.
Yeah.

3324
02:11:18,431 --> 02:11:20,670
Well I mentioned,
makes a lot of sense,

3325
02:11:20,730 --> 02:11:23,740
but at least those are scheduled.
I don't think that that's um,

3326
02:11:23,820 --> 02:11:27,170
caused to be able to have the right to,
to run somebody over and kill me.

3327
02:11:27,180 --> 02:11:27,691
No,
no.

3328
02:11:27,691 --> 02:11:30,480
You shouldn't have the right.
Don't think somebody's life is not worth

3329
02:11:30,481 --> 02:11:31,314
something because they're expressing 
themselves in a way that you disagree 

3330
02:11:33,361 --> 02:11:33,630
with.

3331
02:11:33,630 --> 02:11:35,910
Debra does not necessarily what the law 
is saying.

3332
02:11:35,940 --> 02:11:38,430
No law saying that you exonerate someone
responsibility.

3333
02:11:38,431 --> 02:11:40,180
If someone jumps in front of your car 
and tries to stop,

3334
02:11:40,690 --> 02:11:44,580
we've seen he breaks off and smashed 
their car windows because they're trying

3335
02:11:44,581 --> 02:11:45,414
to get through some sort of a protest 
line and they don't have anything to do 

3336
02:11:47,311 --> 02:11:49,340
with what the protest is.
They just want to get out of there.

3337
02:11:49,580 --> 02:11:50,413
I'm in their car and their stock and 
maybe they have their kid with them and 

3338
02:11:52,171 --> 02:11:54,300
the kids crying and freaking out and he 
hit the gas.

3339
02:11:54,740 --> 02:11:55,573
Incredibly detailed.
This is an incredibly detailed example 

3340
02:12:00,471 --> 02:12:01,304
of some of that.
I don't actually have the reference 

3341
02:12:01,941 --> 02:12:03,650
point to,
I don't have a citation for this,

3342
02:12:03,651 --> 02:12:04,484
so I can't argue with you on any of the 
story that you're giving me because I 

3343
02:12:07,251 --> 02:12:10,550
have no way of knowing this,
this incident,

3344
02:12:10,551 --> 02:12:11,384
but I do think that your speculation is 
correct in in the sense that I think 

3345
02:12:14,271 --> 02:12:15,950
that no,
that would be horrible.

3346
02:12:16,040 --> 02:12:17,600
That would be horrible to have people 
saying,

3347
02:12:17,601 --> 02:12:19,850
okay,
this means more to me.

3348
02:12:19,970 --> 02:12:23,270
Then you're getting your kid to your 
sick kid to the hospital.

3349
02:12:23,510 --> 02:12:25,100
I think absolutely.
I think that that,

3350
02:12:25,280 --> 02:12:26,113
no,
I don't think that anybody's life is 

3351
02:12:27,471 --> 02:12:29,180
worth more than another person's life.
What's also,

3352
02:12:29,181 --> 02:12:31,820
there's something going on where there's
a lot of misdirected rage and anger.

3353
02:12:31,821 --> 02:12:33,170
Like my friend was very angry.

3354
02:12:33,260 --> 02:12:34,093
My friend was at one of these things 
where he was trying to get his car 

3355
02:12:35,751 --> 02:12:39,230
through and they were all blocked and 
stopped and people had crossed hands,

3356
02:12:39,231 --> 02:12:40,064
locked hands and blocked the highway and
some guy came up to his window and is 

3357
02:12:42,771 --> 02:12:44,660
screaming,
black lives matter,

3358
02:12:44,810 --> 02:12:46,490
black lives matter,
screaming at his window.

3359
02:12:46,491 --> 02:12:47,030
He's like,
yeah,

3360
02:12:47,030 --> 02:12:48,350
I agree man.
Okay,

3361
02:12:48,410 --> 02:12:49,880
I'm agree,
but I'm stuck in traffic.

3362
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:50,833
Why are you yelling at me?
I'm not doing anything like you were 

3363
02:12:52,341 --> 02:12:55,550
very angry right now.
He's like this white guy yelling at him,

3364
02:12:55,551 --> 02:12:58,370
another white guy and he's screaming 
black lives matter at him.

3365
02:12:58,371 --> 02:12:59,180
It's like,
okay,

3366
02:12:59,180 --> 02:13:02,360
this is so misdirected.
If my friend is a Democrat,

3367
02:13:02,520 --> 02:13:04,340
votes liberal,
he's so,

3368
02:13:04,610 --> 02:13:05,443
so liberal,
like down the board with a pretty much 

3369
02:13:06,621 --> 02:13:07,454
everything and someone's screaming at 
him and screaming at him like he has 

3370
02:13:09,531 --> 02:13:10,364
done something wrong because this person
is misguided and misdirected rage and 

3371
02:13:14,280 --> 02:13:15,113
they're,
they're a part of this whole mob 

3372
02:13:15,981 --> 02:13:17,270
mentality.
Everyone's together,

3373
02:13:17,271 --> 02:13:18,104
they're all chanting and yelling and 
everyone's getting excited and they 

3374
02:13:20,031 --> 02:13:21,410
think that they're doing the right 
thing.

3375
02:13:21,411 --> 02:13:24,500
And these kids today,
a lot of them that are involved in these

3376
02:13:24,501 --> 02:13:25,334
protests,
they're so enamored by this idea that 

3377
02:13:27,201 --> 02:13:29,420
they're doing the right thing.
They're enacting change.

3378
02:13:29,600 --> 02:13:32,160
They don't realize that they're also 
polarizing

3379
02:13:32,160 --> 02:13:32,993
the opposition,
and this is one of the reasons why 

3380
02:13:34,171 --> 02:13:35,004
Donald Trump was elected in the first 
place because so many people are so 

3381
02:13:37,021 --> 02:13:41,670
tired of people shoving in their phase,
they're righteous indignation shoving in

3382
02:13:41,671 --> 02:13:42,504
their face is locking hands and blocking
the highway and you have to listen to 

3383
02:13:45,001 --> 02:13:47,910
us.
That is energy and it goes like this.

3384
02:13:48,060 --> 02:13:50,100
And then when it goes like that,
people go like that.

3385
02:13:50,130 --> 02:13:51,990
It's in and out.
There's a cycle.

3386
02:13:52,020 --> 02:13:54,270
And can you understand where the rage is
built up of?

3387
02:13:54,271 --> 02:13:55,104
People felt like they've been ignored 
and they've been pushed back so hard 

3388
02:13:58,531 --> 02:13:59,364
that they actually start exploding like 
that and they get into these hives 

3389
02:14:01,291 --> 02:14:02,940
because they have no other group to 
belong to.

3390
02:14:03,330 --> 02:14:04,163
There's definitely a way that you could 
see that there's definitely a way that 

3391
02:14:07,861 --> 02:14:10,590
makes sense.
What is the appropriate way to do things

3392
02:14:10,591 --> 02:14:15,210
then to continue to write,
to continue to talk,

3393
02:14:15,211 --> 02:14:16,044
to continue to express yourself in a way
that's going to make other people 

3394
02:14:19,621 --> 02:14:23,570
consider what you're saying and maybe 
change people's minds and thoughts and,

3395
02:14:23,590 --> 02:14:25,980
and it's not an instantaneous thing.

3396
02:14:26,400 --> 02:14:28,560
It's not like you put up a sign and 
everything's fixed.

3397
02:14:28,561 --> 02:14:31,350
No,
it's take society that right.

3398
02:14:31,370 --> 02:14:32,203
But I think that's part of the rage of 
people screaming as they want it to 

3399
02:14:34,141 --> 02:14:37,020
change now and by going up to my 
friend's window and yelling,

3400
02:14:37,050 --> 02:14:40,250
black lives matter this fuck.
Head thinks he's going to change that,

3401
02:14:40,251 --> 02:14:41,084
but he doesn't even really think that.
He thinks he's got the right to do it 

3402
02:14:43,261 --> 02:14:44,820
and you've got to fucking listen to me,
man.

3403
02:14:44,910 --> 02:14:45,743
There's this thing going on where people
get these mob mindsets where they think 

3404
02:14:49,621 --> 02:14:50,454
they're allowed to hit a girl because 
she's got a red hat on that says make 

3405
02:14:53,461 --> 02:14:55,770
bitcoin great again.
Have you seen that video?

3406
02:14:55,980 --> 02:14:59,580
That poor girl got maced in the face?
It was a joe cat.

3407
02:14:59,620 --> 02:15:02,610
They may stir in the fucking face.
I get that.

3408
02:15:03,150 --> 02:15:04,920
I get what you're saying.
And I am,

3409
02:15:04,950 --> 02:15:05,783
I am on board with,
with the sentiment of what you're 

3410
02:15:08,011 --> 02:15:08,370
saying.

3411
02:15:08,370 --> 02:15:11,420
I really do understand it,
but I also think there's such it,

3412
02:15:11,820 --> 02:15:12,653
a finger pointing going on and I'm 
guilty of it on my twitter because I go 

3413
02:15:16,771 --> 02:15:19,210
after these fuckheads all the tie.
They call it [inaudible].

3414
02:15:19,230 --> 02:15:20,370
You fell it Nazi.
And I say,

3415
02:15:20,371 --> 02:15:21,450
no,
fuck Donald Trump.

3416
02:15:21,451 --> 02:15:22,284
Seriously,
that person is not qualified to be 

3417
02:15:23,251 --> 02:15:24,720
president.
Well is bad too.

3418
02:15:24,721 --> 02:15:25,381
I was like,
that's not,

3419
02:15:25,381 --> 02:15:26,850
I didn't say anything about him.
I said,

3420
02:15:26,851 --> 02:15:30,330
this person in office is not qualified.
He should step down.

3421
02:15:30,770 --> 02:15:32,080
Um,
but I am.

3422
02:15:32,081 --> 02:15:34,380
Can I really wanted to be president?
No,

3423
02:15:34,381 --> 02:15:35,660
I don't think he wanted to be president 
at all.

3424
02:15:36,070 --> 02:15:37,380
No.
No.

3425
02:15:37,390 --> 02:15:39,810
I think he's terrified.
He is a scared,

3426
02:15:39,811 --> 02:15:42,300
terrified little man up there.
Maybe he's not terrified.

3427
02:15:42,301 --> 02:15:43,890
Maybe he's crazy,
but he,

3428
02:15:43,891 --> 02:15:46,500
I don't think he wanted to do this.
It's just sort of happened.

3429
02:15:46,530 --> 02:15:47,310
Yeah,
I think,

3430
02:15:47,310 --> 02:15:49,140
I think he didn't think it through.

3431
02:15:49,140 --> 02:15:51,360
And I think that's when we're talking 
about not thinking it through.

3432
02:15:51,361 --> 02:15:53,520
I think the guy screaming at your friend
in the window,

3433
02:15:53,521 --> 02:15:55,290
he's not thinking it through.
He's caught on to something.

3434
02:15:55,291 --> 02:15:57,240
He's caught up in a wave of some pen,
do it.

3435
02:15:57,241 --> 02:15:58,650
There's a million other people behind 
them.

3436
02:15:58,651 --> 02:16:00,780
Everyone's screaming,
he's looking at my friend,

3437
02:16:00,781 --> 02:16:01,614
my friend's vulnerable,
my friends below him cause he's seated 

3438
02:16:03,690 --> 02:16:05,670
and he's just screaming.
Black lives matter.

3439
02:16:05,880 --> 02:16:07,210
Black lives matter.
It's like,

3440
02:16:07,980 --> 02:16:10,200
yeah,
it's that bullshit.

3441
02:16:10,260 --> 02:16:11,093
But it's it,
it's awesome that twitter generation 

3442
02:16:13,080 --> 02:16:15,660
protesting.
But it's also,

3443
02:16:15,661 --> 02:16:16,494
we have learned,
it's so hard to just generalize and say 

3444
02:16:19,921 --> 02:16:21,900
everything is because of this and 
everything is because of that,

3445
02:16:21,901 --> 02:16:22,734
isn't it?
Everything has to come from an 

3446
02:16:24,541 --> 02:16:27,090
individual place.
And at the same time we're all trying to

3447
02:16:27,091 --> 02:16:27,924
belong to communities.
We're all trying to belong to something 

3448
02:16:29,020 --> 02:16:30,190
we believe in.
Right.

3449
02:16:30,270 --> 02:16:31,810
And,
and we're latching onto that.

3450
02:16:31,840 --> 02:16:34,370
And then I think that the sins that have
in to the sins that we,

3451
02:16:34,380 --> 02:16:36,220
whatever then that happened along the 
way,

3452
02:16:36,221 --> 02:16:37,780
the missteps that happened along the 
way,

3453
02:16:37,781 --> 02:16:39,730
we tend to forgive them instead of 
pointing out,

3454
02:16:39,731 --> 02:16:41,860
no,
you shouldn't do this.

3455
02:16:41,861 --> 02:16:45,100
You shouldn't affect somebody who's 
driving their child to work or something

3456
02:16:45,101 --> 02:16:46,810
like that,
that that's not what should happen.

3457
02:16:46,960 --> 02:16:49,900
But we do tend to forgive the people who
are in the same team as us.

3458
02:16:49,901 --> 02:16:50,770
Don't wait,
of course.

3459
02:16:50,800 --> 02:16:53,950
And that's where the the make America 
great fuckers.

3460
02:16:53,980 --> 02:16:54,701
Sorry.
I think,

3461
02:16:54,701 --> 02:16:56,040
well anyway,
you do all that.

3462
02:16:56,350 --> 02:16:57,183
They can't see their team lose and 
they'll defend him now to the death of 

3463
02:16:59,801 --> 02:17:01,300
defend his decisions.
He does something wrong.

3464
02:17:01,301 --> 02:17:02,720
Well you don't understand how it works,
do you like?

3465
02:17:03,030 --> 02:17:03,863
No,
I actually had to understand how it 

3466
02:17:04,511 --> 02:17:05,344
works.
This person is not supposed to be in 

3467
02:17:06,181 --> 02:17:07,014
power.
This person's not supposed to represent 

3468
02:17:07,991 --> 02:17:08,824
America.
This is an and and he is and he's not 

3469
02:17:11,590 --> 02:17:12,423
who I want the world to see America as.
I think we're a great country and we 

3470
02:17:14,830 --> 02:17:15,550
fuck up a lot.

3471
02:17:15,550 --> 02:17:19,300
There's also a problem when having a 
popularity contest to decide who gets to

3472
02:17:19,301 --> 02:17:21,310
run things.
Imagine if they had a popularity contest

3473
02:17:21,311 --> 02:17:23,500
to get to see who's the dean of Harvard.
Yeah.

3474
02:17:23,650 --> 02:17:25,210
Like what's the character going to be 
this year?

3475
02:17:25,211 --> 02:17:26,044
The curriculum is going to be

3476
02:17:26,060 --> 02:17:27,380
Jesus.
All right.

3477
02:17:27,400 --> 02:17:28,610
Welcome.
One will.

3478
02:17:28,820 --> 02:17:30,680
I mean that's what's going to be 
happening right now.

3479
02:17:30,681 --> 02:17:31,720
We're going to do away with,
you know,

3480
02:17:31,790 --> 02:17:32,623
the public's,
all the vouchers and the shit that's 

3481
02:17:33,861 --> 02:17:34,694
happening.
There's a lot of weird shit going on 

3482
02:17:35,781 --> 02:17:37,940
that jeff sessions guy scares her shit.
Oh my God,

3483
02:17:37,941 --> 02:17:39,530
he wants to bring back,
just say no.

3484
02:17:39,590 --> 02:17:41,570
Yeah.
Must bring back to 19 he's just saying,

3485
02:17:42,170 --> 02:17:43,003
he just said,
and the marijuana has the same negative 

3486
02:17:44,721 --> 02:17:47,810
effects as heroin language.
Slightly less bad than heroin.

3487
02:17:47,811 --> 02:17:49,790
What the Hell Dude,
like child,

3488
02:17:50,450 --> 02:17:53,720
an old child and it's,
yeah,

3489
02:17:53,721 --> 02:17:54,501
it's not good.
No,

3490
02:17:54,501 --> 02:17:55,251
it's not good.
And,

3491
02:17:55,251 --> 02:17:56,084
and I,
I,

3492
02:17:56,330 --> 02:17:59,540
cause I get worked up thinking about it,
these people in power and I got it.

3493
02:17:59,680 --> 02:18:02,140
As you get worked out and people get 
worked up rather,

3494
02:18:02,380 --> 02:18:04,870
and they start talking about it and they
also realize that,

3495
02:18:04,871 --> 02:18:07,030
hey man,
it really does matter if you vote,

3496
02:18:07,060 --> 02:18:08,820
it really does matter if you're 
politically active,

3497
02:18:08,821 --> 02:18:09,654
right?
It really doesn't matter if you talk 

3498
02:18:10,091 --> 02:18:13,570
about these things that you care,
but the team mentality that we have,

3499
02:18:13,571 --> 02:18:15,970
the US versus them,
it just gets so weird.

3500
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:19,540
It gets so fucking crazy.
People get so out of control with it and

3501
02:18:19,541 --> 02:18:20,470
they,
like you said,

3502
02:18:20,471 --> 02:18:21,304
they,
the people that make America great 

3503
02:18:21,911 --> 02:18:22,744
again,
people they don't want to hear shit 

3504
02:18:23,591 --> 02:18:26,140
about the left.
They didn't want to shit about Bernie.

3505
02:18:26,230 --> 02:18:30,490
They want to say Barack Obama is a 
Muslim and from fucking Kenya,

3506
02:18:31,150 --> 02:18:34,570
and I'm guilty of not wanting to know 
good things about Donald Trump.

3507
02:18:34,750 --> 02:18:36,580
I don't want to know them.
I don't care.

3508
02:18:36,790 --> 02:18:39,550
I don't,
I don't care because I see so much.

3509
02:18:40,300 --> 02:18:41,133
You know?
It's just like there's so much that's 

3510
02:18:41,741 --> 02:18:42,574
working against human achievement with 
him being in power and the people he's 

3511
02:18:44,471 --> 02:18:45,304
appointing.
Empower

3512
02:18:46,010 --> 02:18:48,160
is,
but I think it gives people goal.

3513
02:18:48,580 --> 02:18:49,413
I think it gives people like,
I think without opposition it's very 

3514
02:18:52,661 --> 02:18:53,494
difficult to get motivated and I think 
there's a significant amount of 

3515
02:18:56,411 --> 02:18:59,890
opposition now and people were,
I think they're organizing people on the

3516
02:18:59,891 --> 02:19:03,400
left are organizing in a way that they 
never had before and hopefully hopefully

3517
02:19:03,610 --> 02:19:04,443
people will understand that there'll be 
someone along the line that understands 

3518
02:19:07,511 --> 02:19:11,140
that the polarization effect that 
happens between choosing these hard line

3519
02:19:11,141 --> 02:19:11,974
teams left and right and not recognizing
the possibility that there's so many 

3520
02:19:15,251 --> 02:19:17,380
people in the middle that just pick a 
side.

3521
02:19:17,590 --> 02:19:19,210
They just decided to go left or decide 
to go.

3522
02:19:19,211 --> 02:19:20,500
Right.
And they could be on either side,

3523
02:19:20,680 --> 02:19:23,920
but both of them are unreasonable.
Both of them are unrealistic.

3524
02:19:23,950 --> 02:19:24,910
Yeah.
You know,

3525
02:19:24,911 --> 02:19:25,744
and yeah,
Hillary Clinton was a terrible 

3526
02:19:26,531 --> 02:19:28,190
candidate.
She was a terrible opposition

3527
02:19:28,190 --> 02:19:29,023
candidate.
Hopefully next time they'll be someone 

3528
02:19:29,961 --> 02:19:30,794
that's really good and will understand 
what is the problem with having a 

3529
02:19:33,411 --> 02:19:38,120
medical maniacal egomaniac who was a 
fucking a business vulture run,

3530
02:19:38,121 --> 02:19:40,160
run the country,
which happened.

3531
02:19:40,190 --> 02:19:41,810
I mean that was the choice.
This awareness,

3532
02:19:43,130 --> 02:19:44,300
I,
in my opinion,

3533
02:19:44,301 --> 02:19:46,790
she was more qualified.
She served as secretary of the state.

3534
02:19:46,970 --> 02:19:47,803
Now.
I didn't like that she was a 

3535
02:19:48,501 --> 02:19:52,610
professional politician because I think 
when you're a professional politician,

3536
02:19:52,611 --> 02:19:55,190
then you're dedicated to just winning 
and not,

3537
02:19:55,580 --> 02:19:57,670
you know.
But I don't choose a higher,

3538
02:19:57,770 --> 02:20:01,310
I don't know.
I think problems,

3539
02:20:01,340 --> 02:20:04,190
but who the fuck wants to be president?
That's the other problem.

3540
02:20:04,630 --> 02:20:08,330
Like who the people who want to be 
president don't understand.

3541
02:20:08,331 --> 02:20:12,110
It's the highest public service office 
that you can possibly do.

3542
02:20:12,440 --> 02:20:13,273
Like you're also going to shit on.
The whole world's going to dump on your 

3543
02:20:16,311 --> 02:20:16,910
head.
Yes.

3544
02:20:16,910 --> 02:20:20,860
And you have to act absolutely serve the
country later.

3545
02:20:20,890 --> 02:20:21,723
That's what I don't get.
I don't understand how anybody would 

3546
02:20:23,481 --> 02:20:24,314
want to be president.
I want to give that much of themselves 

3547
02:20:25,371 --> 02:20:27,590
up,
but I also can see how people would want

3548
02:20:27,591 --> 02:20:29,300
to aspire to,
to serve the country,

3549
02:20:29,301 --> 02:20:31,090
not lead the country,
serve the country.

3550
02:20:31,870 --> 02:20:33,350
That's where I just,
I lose my shit.

3551
02:20:33,351 --> 02:20:36,440
Like honestly,
so many of my friends I have,

3552
02:20:37,490 --> 02:20:38,323
I've tried to express this to them.
Then I can't have conversations with 

3553
02:20:39,981 --> 02:20:40,814
them on twitter anymore.
I have to talk to them via text like I 

3554
02:20:43,821 --> 02:20:46,080
can because yeah,
because people jump into my car,

3555
02:20:46,081 --> 02:20:47,370
I kid,
you know,

3556
02:20:47,371 --> 02:20:48,204
and it just,
I got so many rape threats during this 

3557
02:20:50,060 --> 02:20:52,640
fucking election because I was,
oh my God,

3558
02:20:52,641 --> 02:20:53,474
it was insane.
It was just to the point where she was 

3559
02:20:54,801 --> 02:20:55,131
like,
okay,

3560
02:20:55,131 --> 02:20:57,230
I can't speak with this person who's 
arguing with me,

3561
02:20:57,231 --> 02:20:59,780
even though they're my friend and I'm 
not unfriending them not,

3562
02:20:59,840 --> 02:21:00,920
not being their friend.
I'm just like,

3563
02:21:00,921 --> 02:21:01,754
you have to talk to me one on one 
because so many people were just coming 

3564
02:21:03,861 --> 02:21:07,490
at me and he's having a conversation in 
a mall and people just walk by and start

3565
02:21:07,491 --> 02:21:08,324
yelling at you.

3566
02:21:10,430 --> 02:21:12,980
Okay,
good luck.

3567
02:21:13,130 --> 02:21:14,230
I know what,
what do you do with that?

3568
02:21:14,240 --> 02:21:17,750
And I'm okay with understanding like 
that kind of,

3569
02:21:18,170 --> 02:21:20,660
I guess that kind of,
it's not an assault,

3570
02:21:20,661 --> 02:21:22,460
it's,
it's a word indicating.

3571
02:21:22,490 --> 02:21:23,323
So I meant,
but I've been not a public figure 

3572
02:21:25,161 --> 02:21:25,994
necessarily,
but I've had people talk shit about me 

3573
02:21:27,591 --> 02:21:28,424
to my face,
Talk Shit about me here and there 

3574
02:21:29,420 --> 02:21:31,130
because of my previous group.
Because you know,

3575
02:21:31,131 --> 02:21:34,040
in mma you get a certain amount of 
people just telling you how terrible you

3576
02:21:34,041 --> 02:21:35,630
are.
[inaudible] to a certain extent,

3577
02:21:35,660 --> 02:21:36,530
you don't.
Also,

3578
02:21:36,531 --> 02:21:38,780
you want to be desensitized to somebody 
to threatening to rape you.

3579
02:21:38,960 --> 02:21:41,420
You don't want to be deceptive.
You never want that to be,

3580
02:21:41,480 --> 02:21:43,730
it's a terrible thing.
It's a horrible thing.

3581
02:21:44,150 --> 02:21:47,270
So fucking easy to say something and 
just type it out,

3582
02:21:47,590 --> 02:21:51,130
try to get them,
I get Julie's fucking go and yeah,

3583
02:21:51,220 --> 02:21:53,810
and,
and when I'm looking for a fight,

3584
02:21:53,870 --> 02:21:56,510
I jumped right on it because I want to 
fight him,

3585
02:21:56,540 --> 02:21:57,350
you know?

3586
02:21:57,350 --> 02:22:00,290
Why do you want to do that though?
I Miss Combat.

3587
02:22:02,040 --> 02:22:03,890
Really.
I miss arguing with people.

3588
02:22:03,891 --> 02:22:05,750
I do.
I like arguing with my fists or argue.

3589
02:22:05,751 --> 02:22:07,030
I Miss Combat.
I do miss that.

3590
02:22:07,031 --> 02:22:10,760
Like I thought about like maybe entering
grappling competitions might,

3591
02:22:10,840 --> 02:22:12,560
you know,
with that I actually,

3592
02:22:12,561 --> 02:22:15,860
Iowa hasn't really good Brazilian 
Jujitsu club and I went there once and I

3593
02:22:15,861 --> 02:22:17,420
had a great time rolling.
And then I just,

3594
02:22:18,020 --> 02:22:21,080
I don't know what it is about the way my
mentality works,

3595
02:22:21,081 --> 02:22:23,210
but I feel like it would distract me 
away from my writing.

3596
02:22:23,211 --> 02:22:25,680
And I know I wouldn't,
I know it would probably be balancing me

3597
02:22:25,710 --> 02:22:26,543
more,
but I get so intense about the things 

3598
02:22:28,381 --> 02:22:29,214
that I'm doing.
Like I had a list of questions for you 

3599
02:22:30,751 --> 02:22:33,810
today just because I wanted to find out 
what you think about certain things like

3600
02:22:33,990 --> 02:22:34,950
as you get,
so,

3601
02:22:34,980 --> 02:22:37,560
uh,
I narrow minded maybe as a thing for it,

3602
02:22:37,561 --> 02:22:38,394
but I just get so obsessed about getting
answers to certain things or asking 

3603
02:22:41,641 --> 02:22:42,410
questions about things.

3604
02:22:42,410 --> 02:22:43,243
Now I'm afraid I'd do that with 
grappling and Jujitsu and I would get 

3605
02:22:45,601 --> 02:22:49,980
too far into that and not address the 
new direction that my life needs to take

3606
02:22:50,760 --> 02:22:52,970
a lot like me.
Well,

3607
02:22:53,250 --> 02:22:55,170
I'm a terrible standup comedian,
so you're,

3608
02:22:55,220 --> 02:22:56,910
you're nothing like your,
you're good.

3609
02:22:57,880 --> 02:23:01,770
You're a need to like get completely 
absorbed and it's,

3610
02:23:02,430 --> 02:23:04,860
and then you're worried about being 
absorbed and other things.

3611
02:23:05,160 --> 02:23:06,180
I do.
And it's like,

3612
02:23:06,181 --> 02:23:07,020
it's a weird,
it's,

3613
02:23:07,050 --> 02:23:10,550
I got sort of diagnosed when I went 
through my depression spelling.

3614
02:23:10,610 --> 02:23:11,790
I'd been,
I'd had depression before,

3615
02:23:11,791 --> 02:23:13,620
but you know,
post fight depression was pretty rough.

3616
02:23:14,160 --> 02:23:14,880
And,
um,

3617
02:23:14,880 --> 02:23:15,930
you know,
I was on this,

3618
02:23:15,931 --> 02:23:20,220
I was on that and my body was like 
getting all weird and um,

3619
02:23:20,580 --> 02:23:21,413
they said that I have real attention 
deficit disorder problems and still 

3620
02:23:23,521 --> 02:23:26,490
going through the testing for that.
But they did give me adderall,

3621
02:23:26,491 --> 02:23:27,750
which is amazing.

3622
02:23:29,790 --> 02:23:31,530
Amazing,
dangerous.

3623
02:23:31,830 --> 02:23:33,150
Very dangerous.
I know.

3624
02:23:33,280 --> 02:23:35,430
It sounds like it calmed me down so 
much.

3625
02:23:35,431 --> 02:23:37,140
I was so calm and I was like,
oh,

3626
02:23:37,141 --> 02:23:38,820
we're all calmed you down.
Yes.

3627
02:23:38,960 --> 02:23:41,850
That's what they say about the people 
that have adhd.

3628
02:23:42,970 --> 02:23:43,810
It's just like,
oh,

3629
02:23:43,811 --> 02:23:45,330
okay,
this makes a lot more sense.

3630
02:23:45,331 --> 02:23:47,070
I'm not looking at 10,000
things at once.

3631
02:23:47,071 --> 02:23:47,850
Right.
Like,

3632
02:23:47,850 --> 02:23:49,690
cause I couldn't run a 10,000
things at once.

3633
02:23:50,910 --> 02:23:51,743
Actually.
It's something I did talk to my 

3634
02:23:54,121 --> 02:23:54,954
therapist and I was just like,
what am I going to lose creativity this 

3635
02:23:56,881 --> 02:23:57,714
way?
Like I'm not going to you on still on 

3636
02:23:59,851 --> 02:24:01,190
the antidepressants.
No,

3637
02:24:01,200 --> 02:24:02,033
no.
I went off of them when I started 

3638
02:24:03,001 --> 02:24:04,130
school.
Um,

3639
02:24:04,470 --> 02:24:05,940
they mess with your sex life a little 
bit.

3640
02:24:06,390 --> 02:24:08,400
I don't have an active one anymore,
so it doesn't matter.

3641
02:24:08,401 --> 02:24:09,430
But you know,
just a,

3642
02:24:09,470 --> 02:24:11,100
it was like you can't,
for me it was like,

3643
02:24:11,101 --> 02:24:11,934
it was really hard for me to reach 
orgasm and stuff when I was hauling 

3644
02:24:13,831 --> 02:24:14,370
them.

3645
02:24:14,370 --> 02:24:15,203
I know we're talking everything.
I try not to bash and I know I shit my 

3646
02:24:18,991 --> 02:24:20,820
pants.
I couldn't orgasm for a year.

3647
02:24:22,190 --> 02:24:23,150
Yeah,
about,

3648
02:24:23,330 --> 02:24:25,170
I think it was rough.
It was rough,

3649
02:24:25,171 --> 02:24:27,780
but I was also so sad like,
you know,

3650
02:24:27,781 --> 02:24:31,890
like I dunno,
but now that I'm off of them,

3651
02:24:31,930 --> 02:24:35,220
I've also mid thirties so sex is 
awesome.

3652
02:24:35,580 --> 02:24:38,100
Like as a woman and you're like,
I turned,

3653
02:24:38,190 --> 02:24:39,960
I turned 36 on Saturday and I'm just 
like,

3654
02:24:39,961 --> 02:24:42,150
I've never been in a happier,
like,

3655
02:24:42,240 --> 02:24:43,530
which is weird because you think,
okay,

3656
02:24:43,531 --> 02:24:46,590
well my fertility is dwayne dwindling.
I may not have kids,

3657
02:24:46,591 --> 02:24:48,240
I may have kids who knows what's going 
to happen,

3658
02:24:48,270 --> 02:24:52,380
but sex as a woman in your mid thirties 
is awesome.

3659
02:24:53,080 --> 02:24:54,840
Now I know so much better.
Yeah.

3660
02:24:54,841 --> 02:24:56,520
Now you know like,
yeah,

3661
02:24:56,550 --> 02:24:58,950
I mean I'm sure that's something that 
would keep you up at night.

3662
02:24:58,980 --> 02:25:03,330
What does a woman that it's,
I can't believe I'm talking about this,

3663
02:25:03,331 --> 02:25:04,680
but it doesn't matter.

3664
02:25:04,680 --> 02:25:05,620
It doesn't matter.
It's,

3665
02:25:05,621 --> 02:25:07,680
it's real life and real bodies and you 
know,

3666
02:25:07,690 --> 02:25:08,523
people go through things.
And antidepressants really messed me up 

3667
02:25:11,010 --> 02:25:12,620
for,
for men as well.

3668
02:25:12,750 --> 02:25:13,201
Yeah,
it was,

3669
02:25:13,201 --> 02:25:14,940
it was tough,
but it was needed.

3670
02:25:15,270 --> 02:25:16,380
I,
I didn't,

3671
02:25:18,240 --> 02:25:19,073
I didn't want to hurt myself anymore and
I think that I was going down a path 

3672
02:25:22,561 --> 02:25:25,220
where I was going be hurting myself.
So yeah,

3673
02:25:25,280 --> 02:25:27,310
with your decisions,
with the mindset,

3674
02:25:27,530 --> 02:25:28,363
just physically,
like I have a history of eating 

3675
02:25:29,951 --> 02:25:30,784
disorders and doing things and it's like
I could see myself slipping into that 

3676
02:25:33,191 --> 02:25:36,460
path again.
And so it was like leaving,

3677
02:25:36,461 --> 02:25:40,570
fighting and then discovering that I 
actually really want to explore this new

3678
02:25:40,660 --> 02:25:41,493
area of fighting that is writing or this
new area of creativity that is writing 

3679
02:25:43,871 --> 02:25:46,630
that you can bring fighting into.
And um,

3680
02:25:46,690 --> 02:25:47,523
I needed all of these kinds of things to
be laid out and I thought I probably 

3681
02:25:49,661 --> 02:25:50,494
would have interrupted myself if I 
hadn't gone on antidepressants and I 

3682
02:25:52,961 --> 02:25:57,370
hadn't kind of pulled back a little bit 
from feeling everything so intensely.

3683
02:25:57,440 --> 02:25:59,420
And were you worried that you were 
worthy?

3684
02:25:59,460 --> 02:26:02,070
The adderall was going to invade your 
creative thoughts.

3685
02:26:02,071 --> 02:26:02,570
And

3686
02:26:02,570 --> 02:26:04,130
I'm,
I'm worried about that now.

3687
02:26:04,190 --> 02:26:05,750
I'm still being tech.
They put me on it,

3688
02:26:05,751 --> 02:26:07,610
but they said we have to go through all 
this testing for it.

3689
02:26:07,611 --> 02:26:08,444
So I'm still being tested for if I have 
attention deficit disorder or what or 

3690
02:26:11,901 --> 02:26:13,500
whatever it is.
Um,

3691
02:26:13,580 --> 02:26:17,390
that makes me think in a peculiar way or
not be able to get tasks finished.

3692
02:26:17,960 --> 02:26:18,691
And so,
you know,

3693
02:26:18,691 --> 02:26:19,250
we're,
we're,

3694
02:26:19,250 --> 02:26:20,540
I'm still being tested for it,
but you know,

3695
02:26:20,541 --> 02:26:21,374
taking it now I am able to,
I'm able to calm down any ticket once a 

3696
02:26:27,190 --> 02:26:28,550
day,
but it only lasts four hours.

3697
02:26:28,551 --> 02:26:29,384
So my doctor gave me an f for two a day.
I've only taken one today and it was 

3698
02:26:32,301 --> 02:26:33,134
hours.
I've been drinking a shit load of 

3699
02:26:33,531 --> 02:26:34,364
coffee,
but I took one like earlier this 

3700
02:26:35,600 --> 02:26:36,380
morning.
But that was,

3701
02:26:36,380 --> 02:26:38,150
what does it do?
Like what's the effect?

3702
02:26:38,510 --> 02:26:42,590
So if say I wake up in,
in,

3703
02:26:42,591 --> 02:26:45,680
in my room and I look and it's messy in 
my room,

3704
02:26:46,160 --> 02:26:49,490
um,
what I tend to do or my tendency to do,

3705
02:26:49,491 --> 02:26:50,324
especially post fighting whenever,
why we entered this weird mindspace is 

3706
02:26:54,050 --> 02:26:57,140
panic about this is messy here.

3707
02:26:57,230 --> 02:26:59,570
This being messy here means I won't be 
able to complete this task,

3708
02:26:59,700 --> 02:27:01,340
this will happen here,
this'll happen here.

3709
02:27:01,341 --> 02:27:02,174
And then I'm never going to meet.
And then I just get paralyzed and I 

3710
02:27:04,011 --> 02:27:04,844
panic and I'm fearful that I can't 
actually just get out of bed to put a 

3711
02:27:07,761 --> 02:27:11,000
shirt on or to pick something up because
everything,

3712
02:27:11,001 --> 02:27:13,640
all of a sudden clouds in at once.
And,

3713
02:27:13,720 --> 02:27:17,390
um,
it would lead me to hyperfocus on really

3714
02:27:17,391 --> 02:27:18,224
strange things.
And I think that actually helped with 

3715
02:27:20,481 --> 02:27:23,450
fighting if that's what I have.
I'm still in the diagnosis,

3716
02:27:23,451 --> 02:27:25,250
like process of this.
But you know,

3717
02:27:25,251 --> 02:27:27,260
so far this is the medicine that's 
worked the best for me.

3718
02:27:27,261 --> 02:27:28,370
But,
um,

3719
02:27:28,460 --> 02:27:29,840
when,
when I was fighting,

3720
02:27:30,080 --> 02:27:30,913
one thing that I did do poorly was I 
would go from a to c instead of go to a 

3721
02:27:33,561 --> 02:27:34,394
to b to c,
I would see what would happen after I 

3722
02:27:35,871 --> 02:27:36,530
won the fight.

3723
02:27:36,530 --> 02:27:39,320
In my mind when I first started training
camp,

3724
02:27:39,321 --> 02:27:41,270
which a lot of fighters do and I think 
that helps,

3725
02:27:41,450 --> 02:27:42,283
but sometimes you miss b where the 
actual fight happens and in my mind 

3726
02:27:45,291 --> 02:27:46,124
sometimes I would gloss over that and I 
would get caught up in things and I 

3727
02:27:48,291 --> 02:27:51,380
would wait for this to happen and wait 
for that time or be paralyzed and not be

3728
02:27:51,381 --> 02:27:54,470
able to make the next step.
Right now I feel like I am able to,

3729
02:27:54,471 --> 02:27:55,304
when I take a pill,
I'm able to put my feet on the ground 

3730
02:27:59,630 --> 02:28:01,340
out of bed,
look up and say,

3731
02:28:01,341 --> 02:28:02,630
okay,
my room needs to be cleaned,

3732
02:28:02,631 --> 02:28:05,030
but first I need to do this and I'm able
to make,

3733
02:28:05,031 --> 02:28:05,864
I'm able to go to a to B and then do z 
instead of just jumping over and then 

3734
02:28:09,081 --> 02:28:09,914
looking at sea and then thinking all of 
the things after me just come crashing 

3735
02:28:11,541 --> 02:28:12,500
at me and I freak out.

3736
02:28:13,590 --> 02:28:18,510
Now you said earlier that post career I 
started thinking about brain trauma.

3737
02:28:18,570 --> 02:28:20,930
Yeah,
I started thinking about do you do what?

3738
02:28:20,990 --> 02:28:22,640
Like what thoughts specifically

3739
02:28:23,180 --> 02:28:25,680
I wondered about well the depression.
Right,

3740
02:28:25,770 --> 02:28:26,540
right.
You know,

3741
02:28:26,540 --> 02:28:28,370
and I wonder about how many shots that 
I've taken.

3742
02:28:28,371 --> 02:28:30,920
I mean they had a good chin.
I was rocked a lot in the gym.

3743
02:28:30,921 --> 02:28:33,560
I sparred a lot.
I mean I,

3744
02:28:33,860 --> 02:28:34,631
you know,
like I say,

3745
02:28:34,631 --> 02:28:38,480
I like back in the old days I would 
fight whatever opportunity came my way.

3746
02:28:38,481 --> 02:28:39,420
Never took,
had,

3747
02:28:39,440 --> 02:28:41,540
didn't have ct scans till I got into 
strike force,

3748
02:28:41,541 --> 02:28:43,490
which was late in my career.
So,

3749
02:28:43,510 --> 02:28:47,390
or a ct or MRI,
I forgot which one does what.

3750
02:28:47,391 --> 02:28:52,040
So I don't know how much of um,
the dizziness that I have is like,

3751
02:28:52,520 --> 02:28:54,140
yeah,
just like a little here,

3752
02:28:54,141 --> 02:28:54,591
here,
here,

3753
02:28:54,591 --> 02:28:55,370
you know.
That's right.

3754
02:28:55,370 --> 02:28:56,203
You know,
like not like not finding my sunglasses 

3755
02:28:58,011 --> 02:29:00,770
because were on the top of my head and 
wandering around looking for them.

3756
02:29:00,970 --> 02:29:02,630
And for a while there I was really 
scared.

3757
02:29:02,630 --> 02:29:04,490
Maybe this is a post fight,
you know,

3758
02:29:04,610 --> 02:29:06,390
brain trauma and,
and,

3759
02:29:06,391 --> 02:29:08,650
and the depression set in pretty hard 
post fight.

3760
02:29:08,651 --> 02:29:09,500
So I was wondering,
well,

3761
02:29:09,501 --> 02:29:10,760
what,
you know,

3762
02:29:10,761 --> 02:29:12,530
and,
and seeing doctors and stuff like that.

3763
02:29:12,531 --> 02:29:13,364
Like,
you know,

3764
02:29:13,850 --> 02:29:14,990
I,
they were like,

3765
02:29:14,991 --> 02:29:16,100
you know,
maybe you should get an Mri,

3766
02:29:16,101 --> 02:29:16,934
maybe we shoot your brain checked,
but let's also address the depression 

3767
02:29:18,981 --> 02:29:19,814
right now.
And once the depression was addressed 

3768
02:29:21,590 --> 02:29:22,423
and I was able to see that there's 
something else going on here that may 

3769
02:29:24,021 --> 02:29:25,460
not be,
um,

3770
02:29:25,940 --> 02:29:26,773
due to getting hit in the head,
it may actually be due to me having a 

3771
02:29:28,581 --> 02:29:29,414
chemical thing that makes me just all 
over the place because I'm in the best 

3772
02:29:33,711 --> 02:29:35,090
school in the world for writing right 
now.

3773
02:29:35,120 --> 02:29:39,050
I didn't get in there like without I a 
how to explain it.

3774
02:29:39,680 --> 02:29:40,513
The focus is different.
I think I just needed to channel it and 

3775
02:29:42,651 --> 02:29:46,100
I think that I got very scared that I 
had brain damage,

3776
02:29:46,130 --> 02:29:48,850
that I was going to never be able to do 
anything but I wasn't going to win.

3777
02:29:48,870 --> 02:29:49,703
And the truth was I think that my body 
chemistry had changed somewhat and my 

3778
02:29:54,951 --> 02:29:57,590
learning disassociated or my learning,
whatever it is,

3779
02:29:57,591 --> 02:30:01,220
that that made me good at fighting had 
to translate into a different world.

3780
02:30:01,700 --> 02:30:02,533
And so I had to kind of take steps to do
that and get into some pretty intense 

3781
02:30:04,971 --> 02:30:07,640
therapy and do things like that in order
to understand that no,

3782
02:30:07,641 --> 02:30:11,010
my brain is just wired differently.
So a,

3783
02:30:11,210 --> 02:30:14,060
I don't know if it's the creative brain 
or the obsessive rain or whatever.

3784
02:30:15,350 --> 02:30:16,450
Yeah,
it's,

3785
02:30:16,451 --> 02:30:17,284
um,
I mean I sound like I'm talking bro 

3786
02:30:18,351 --> 02:30:22,070
Science here because they really don't 
have my diagnosis sheet to show you from

3787
02:30:22,071 --> 02:30:23,690
an actual doctor.
And not only that,

3788
02:30:23,880 --> 02:30:24,713
they're,
the reality of depression is that a 

3789
02:30:26,241 --> 02:30:28,910
doctor can't really say like,
Oh hey look,

3790
02:30:28,911 --> 02:30:29,990
you've got herpes.
There it is.

3791
02:30:29,991 --> 02:30:30,651
Right,
right.

3792
02:30:30,651 --> 02:30:31,040
You know what I mean?

3793
02:30:31,040 --> 02:30:34,640
It's not something like that.
It's depression is some very,

3794
02:30:34,641 --> 02:30:35,474
very difficult thing to define and you 
only know whether or not you have it 

3795
02:30:37,851 --> 02:30:40,040
yourself.
They can't like scan you and go,

3796
02:30:40,041 --> 02:30:40,874
oh Julia and depressed.
You can answer a whole bunch of 

3797
02:30:42,531 --> 02:30:43,140
questions.
Right.

3798
02:30:43,140 --> 02:30:43,973
Did they give you,
but you can also lie if you know what 

3799
02:30:45,501 --> 02:30:46,334
they're looking for,
which is what I did in many depression 

3800
02:30:47,781 --> 02:30:48,501
tests.
I would just lie,

3801
02:30:48,501 --> 02:30:51,380
cause I didn't want people to think I 
had depression and it was just like,

3802
02:30:51,381 --> 02:30:52,214
okay,
but I am actually feeling this on this 

3803
02:30:53,751 --> 02:30:55,700
survey.
I should answer this correctly.

3804
02:30:56,240 --> 02:30:57,680
And I,
I will say that,

3805
02:30:57,840 --> 02:30:59,250
uh,
something that I did,

3806
02:30:59,430 --> 02:31:00,263
you know,
when I look back at my lifetime of 

3807
02:31:00,901 --> 02:31:01,734
choices and thinks that he did,
I self medicated with experiences like 

3808
02:31:04,531 --> 02:31:05,910
trying to have this experience,
this experience,

3809
02:31:05,911 --> 02:31:06,930
isn't it,
have all of this,

3810
02:31:06,931 --> 02:31:07,651
all of this,
do this,

3811
02:31:07,651 --> 02:31:08,730
do this,
do you know all of this?

3812
02:31:08,970 --> 02:31:11,430
And I sold Medicare.
I had very severe bulemia Yep.

3813
02:31:11,770 --> 02:31:12,820
That would calm me down.
It,

3814
02:31:12,821 --> 02:31:14,370
we call me down.
No,

3815
02:31:14,460 --> 02:31:16,030
I'm the early,
early days of fighting.

3816
02:31:16,031 --> 02:31:18,310
It's actually one of the things I 
really,

3817
02:31:18,490 --> 02:31:19,323
and I don't talk about it,
but I really credit Greg Jackson for 

3818
02:31:21,001 --> 02:31:23,070
this and putting me on a pad because I 
confessed to him,

3819
02:31:23,071 --> 02:31:23,904
okay,
this is a problem that I have when I 

3820
02:31:24,751 --> 02:31:25,960
first seen him that this is something 
that I've,

3821
02:31:26,070 --> 02:31:27,930
I've dealt with a little bit with some 
treatments,

3822
02:31:28,170 --> 02:31:29,340
but you know,
I puked my,

3823
02:31:29,370 --> 02:31:34,370
my food up and he,
he didn't let me any more.

3824
02:31:34,651 --> 02:31:35,900
I don't know how to explain.
You didn't let me anywhere,

3825
02:31:35,901 --> 02:31:36,734
but he just,
he put a lot of care and pressure on me 

3826
02:31:38,341 --> 02:31:41,430
to be a more mentally healthy person by 
directing that energy,

3827
02:31:41,670 --> 02:31:42,503
that panicked energy when we get all 
worked up and just have to go puke 

3828
02:31:45,280 --> 02:31:46,740
because I didn't know what else to do 
with myself.

3829
02:31:46,890 --> 02:31:51,300
And he helped me direct that energy into
the sport and he gave me tasks to do and

3830
02:31:51,301 --> 02:31:52,920
I ended up working for him,
but it was just like him.

3831
02:31:52,930 --> 02:31:56,160
He's really fucking good dude.
Like it really good dude.

3832
02:31:56,340 --> 02:31:57,870
And yeah,
and,

3833
02:31:57,880 --> 02:31:58,580
and,
and just,

3834
02:31:58,580 --> 02:31:59,670
you know,
I would,

3835
02:31:59,820 --> 02:32:00,653
I honestly credit him for,
I think he saved my life to a certain 

3836
02:32:02,251 --> 02:32:04,990
extent because I got pretty bad there 
for a while.

3837
02:32:04,991 --> 02:32:05,830
Like,
and um,

3838
02:32:05,880 --> 02:32:06,713
when I moved to Jackson's it was like 
sort of that understanding that I'm 

3839
02:32:09,930 --> 02:32:10,763
stepping into a new realm where I am a 
professional athlete now I have to 

3840
02:32:14,761 --> 02:32:17,160
conduct myself a certain way.
I have to eat food a certain way.

3841
02:32:17,161 --> 02:32:19,470
I have to address my body's or we have 
to,

3842
02:32:19,500 --> 02:32:20,760
you know,
it,

3843
02:32:20,850 --> 02:32:21,683
it,
it took a burden off of me that made me 

3844
02:32:23,401 --> 02:32:24,234
panic.
And I don't know how to explain that to 

3845
02:32:24,931 --> 02:32:25,590
give me purpose.

3846
02:32:25,590 --> 02:32:30,450
Maybe to be somebody that's somebody 
else's invested in to understand,

3847
02:32:30,451 --> 02:32:30,901
okay.
He's like,

3848
02:32:30,901 --> 02:32:31,734
you know,
you're my first female MMA fighter that 

3849
02:32:33,451 --> 02:32:36,330
I really want to put work into,
so don't get fucking pregnant.

3850
02:32:36,360 --> 02:32:37,710
Don't do this,
don't puke anymore.

3851
02:32:37,711 --> 02:32:38,270
Don't do that.
You know,

3852
02:32:38,270 --> 02:32:39,103
usually we put some rules in place for 
me when I came there because he said he 

3853
02:32:41,341 --> 02:32:42,510
wasn't really on board with him.
Oh,

3854
02:32:42,511 --> 02:32:44,430
I shouldn't say that because I always 
get him a lot of shit.

3855
02:32:44,580 --> 02:32:46,470
He was on board with female mma and 
then,

3856
02:32:46,471 --> 02:32:48,000
you know,
he saw my carano fight,

3857
02:32:48,001 --> 02:32:49,710
he liked it and he liked me and he was 
just like,

3858
02:32:49,711 --> 02:32:51,300
okay,
I'll give this a shot.

3859
02:32:51,840 --> 02:32:55,980
And for me it saved my life because I 
don't know where I would be without mma.

3860
02:32:56,580 --> 02:32:57,630
Um,
for,

3861
02:32:58,110 --> 02:32:59,820
you know,
and when it comes to,

3862
02:32:59,940 --> 02:33:00,773
I guess the bulemia and the,
the self sabotage that I was doing to 

3863
02:33:03,841 --> 02:33:08,841
myself competing in the sport and,
and finding purpose,

3864
02:33:09,790 --> 02:33:10,770
it was really important.

3865
02:33:10,770 --> 02:33:12,510
And just the talks I would have with him
about like,

3866
02:33:12,511 --> 02:33:14,760
you know,
philosophy and this kind of thing.

3867
02:33:14,761 --> 02:33:15,594
Cause it's,
it's hard to find people to talk about 

3868
02:33:17,910 --> 02:33:20,860
some intellectual subjects with 
sometimes in that sport or antigen.

3869
02:33:20,870 --> 02:33:21,703
Yeah.
And so to be able to sit down and break 

3870
02:33:22,681 --> 02:33:24,000
things down and think,
okay,

3871
02:33:24,001 --> 02:33:25,470
I can use my brain this way,
this is great.

3872
02:33:25,860 --> 02:33:27,660
And then when I quit fighting and I 
moved to Kansas,

3873
02:33:27,661 --> 02:33:31,470
I didn't have that bubble anymore.
I didn't have that,

3874
02:33:31,471 --> 02:33:33,000
that home or that,
that feeling.

3875
02:33:33,001 --> 02:33:33,571
Right.
You know?

3876
02:33:33,571 --> 02:33:34,404
And so it was just like I just slid 
right backwards and I was gaining all 

3877
02:33:36,901 --> 02:33:37,860
this weight and I was,
you know,

3878
02:33:37,861 --> 02:33:39,720
I just became very eating poorly.
Oh yeah,

3879
02:33:39,721 --> 02:33:40,830
of course.
Yeah.

3880
02:33:40,860 --> 02:33:41,693
I mean you,
sugar is so addictive when you actually 

3881
02:33:43,831 --> 02:33:45,450
get to eat it again.
Like what do you do?

3882
02:33:45,451 --> 02:33:46,810
Like it's,
it feels so good.

3883
02:33:46,840 --> 02:33:48,540
Like,
so yeah,

3884
02:33:48,570 --> 02:33:50,700
I went through a rough time there and 
then I,

3885
02:33:52,350 --> 02:33:54,210
I found school and I was like,
Oh shit,

3886
02:33:54,270 --> 02:33:56,310
I can do this.
This is where my energy can be.

3887
02:33:56,760 --> 02:33:57,430
So

3888
02:33:57,430 --> 02:33:58,990
well,
that's awesome that you found something.

3889
02:33:58,991 --> 02:33:59,824
I mean,
I would really think that diet would 

3890
02:34:00,821 --> 02:34:03,700
have also a pretty significant effect on
the way your brain works.

3891
02:34:03,780 --> 02:34:04,450
Oh,
you have to,

3892
02:34:04,450 --> 02:34:06,820
do you monitor that now?
Do you take care of yourself now?

3893
02:34:07,130 --> 02:34:07,820
Yes.

3894
02:34:07,820 --> 02:34:09,110
Yes.
Because I actually,

3895
02:34:09,111 --> 02:34:10,350
I'm,
I mean I still,

3896
02:34:10,351 --> 02:34:11,184
I'll drink sugar.
Like I'll put sugar in a drink or 

3897
02:34:12,801 --> 02:34:13,820
something like that,
but I don't,

3898
02:34:13,821 --> 02:34:15,420
I don't care for it as much.
My,

3899
02:34:15,421 --> 02:34:16,910
my tastes have kind of changed over 
time.

3900
02:34:17,200 --> 02:34:19,180
I like vegetables.
I like meat.

3901
02:34:19,420 --> 02:34:19,811
I,
you know,

3902
02:34:19,811 --> 02:34:22,690
vegetables and meat were a huge staple 
when I was fighting.

3903
02:34:22,691 --> 02:34:25,600
And now when I find myself just being 
drawn to that anyway,

3904
02:34:25,630 --> 02:34:26,650
you know,
and,

3905
02:34:26,651 --> 02:34:27,131
but,
you know,

3906
02:34:27,131 --> 02:34:28,030
post fighting,
it's like,

3907
02:34:28,031 --> 02:34:31,570
it's the orgy of sugar in things you 
were never allowed to have.

3908
02:34:31,580 --> 02:34:33,550
And Yeah.
And it's like,

3909
02:34:33,551 --> 02:34:34,210
well,
you weren't,

3910
02:34:34,210 --> 02:34:36,100
body reasoning wasn't designed to eat 
this anyway,

3911
02:34:36,280 --> 02:34:37,113
so it's going to affect your brain to 
just give yourself like a cheat day or 

3912
02:34:40,241 --> 02:34:43,600
award day or some point that what I 
don't do is,

3913
02:34:44,030 --> 02:34:44,863
um,
and this could come from a lifetime of 

3914
02:34:46,030 --> 02:34:47,740
Catholicism.
Like I don't,

3915
02:34:47,741 --> 02:34:48,131
yeah,
I know,

3916
02:34:48,131 --> 02:34:48,941
right?
Yeah.

3917
02:34:48,941 --> 02:34:49,611
But no,
I,

3918
02:34:49,611 --> 02:34:51,640
I,
I grew up very Catholic.

3919
02:34:51,860 --> 02:34:54,220
I'm very not Catholic now.
Don't tell my grandma.

3920
02:34:54,430 --> 02:34:55,300
Um,
no,

3921
02:34:55,301 --> 02:34:57,430
but what I don't do is I don't beat 
myself up.

3922
02:34:57,640 --> 02:34:59,890
If I eat junk food,
fine.

3923
02:34:59,920 --> 02:35:01,450
Okay.
But the next meal is going to be healthy

3924
02:35:01,510 --> 02:35:01,960
like,

3925
02:35:01,960 --> 02:35:04,270
so you're more concerned with overall 
health,

3926
02:35:04,271 --> 02:35:05,530
mental,
physical,

3927
02:35:05,531 --> 02:35:08,170
the whole thing.
And to be obsessive about something,

3928
02:35:08,171 --> 02:35:11,020
it's actually probably worse than just 
having a little sugar.

3929
02:35:11,560 --> 02:35:12,180
Yes.
And,

3930
02:35:12,180 --> 02:35:14,260
and I guess when it to be,
yeah,

3931
02:35:14,500 --> 02:35:15,333
yeah,
because then it's self flagellation 

3932
02:35:16,530 --> 02:35:17,440
right.
Then you're just like,

3933
02:35:17,441 --> 02:35:18,011
Oh fuck,
oh,

3934
02:35:18,011 --> 02:35:18,844
I just not everything is terrible.
I'm just going to eat this terrible 

3935
02:35:20,800 --> 02:35:21,311
person.
Yeah,

3936
02:35:21,311 --> 02:35:22,144
exactly.
It just goes down that spiral and it's 

3937
02:35:23,051 --> 02:35:27,640
kind of dumb and I realized that I need 
something to be obsessive about and that

3938
02:35:27,641 --> 02:35:29,880
has actually come through writing,
you know,

3939
02:35:30,070 --> 02:35:31,060
and that sort of thing.
And,

3940
02:35:31,061 --> 02:35:31,894
and,
and working towards like I'd love to 

3941
02:35:32,771 --> 02:35:36,850
write the great book,
just the book I'm working on it

3942
02:35:38,870 --> 02:35:41,460
of thinking that you have with lend 
itself towards something like that.

3943
02:35:41,461 --> 02:35:45,600
So obsessive style thinking like you 
could really be an amazing tool for you.

3944
02:35:45,700 --> 02:35:47,100
I would hope so.
I hope.

3945
02:35:47,140 --> 02:35:50,530
And I it just,
I guess translating mma to people,

3946
02:35:50,890 --> 02:35:53,740
not just in the,
I think so.

3947
02:35:53,830 --> 02:35:54,670
I think so.
It's a,

3948
02:35:54,730 --> 02:35:56,110
when I first came,
I came into,

3949
02:35:56,111 --> 02:35:56,621
I was just,
no,

3950
02:35:56,621 --> 02:35:57,480
no,
I'm done with them a man,

3951
02:35:57,481 --> 02:35:58,031
I'm not gonna,
you know,

3952
02:35:58,031 --> 02:35:59,230
and then I'm just like,
oh,

3953
02:35:59,231 --> 02:36:01,600
but these are my people.
Like even,

3954
02:36:01,601 --> 02:36:01,720
okay.

3955
02:36:01,720 --> 02:36:04,000
What about your,
just your life experiences itself?

3956
02:36:04,030 --> 02:36:04,863
I mean,
coming from a point of view of someone 

3957
02:36:05,711 --> 02:36:06,544
like you is so smart and articulate,
I would imagine that your memoirs or 

3958
02:36:09,761 --> 02:36:11,730
what you would be able to describe about
your,

3959
02:36:11,830 --> 02:36:12,663
your days competing,
it would be really fascinating and 

3960
02:36:14,621 --> 02:36:15,490
compelling.
Yeah,

3961
02:36:15,940 --> 02:36:16,773
I've definitely worked on that.
Like I've written some things to that 

3962
02:36:19,211 --> 02:36:20,370
extent.
Um,

3963
02:36:20,560 --> 02:36:22,990
the stuff that they picked up for sports
illustrated was really nice.

3964
02:36:22,991 --> 02:36:23,920
Like that,
that was nice.

3965
02:36:23,921 --> 02:36:25,210
That was a,
that was a help.

3966
02:36:25,680 --> 02:36:28,450
Um,
I like things to be on a little bit.

3967
02:36:28,770 --> 02:36:31,810
It gets a little bit,
and not woo woo like literary level,

3968
02:36:31,811 --> 02:36:32,740
but just,
it's something that's,

3969
02:36:32,741 --> 02:36:33,574
um,
I'd like symbol a little bit more 

3970
02:36:35,651 --> 02:36:36,850
symbolism,
a little bit more.

3971
02:36:36,851 --> 02:36:37,684
Um,
I dunno when I wrote the piece about 

3972
02:36:39,311 --> 02:36:42,250
Chi,
it's the piece that got me into Iowa.

3973
02:36:42,390 --> 02:36:43,223
It was the piece about cutting weight 
when I decided to retire and when I cut 

3974
02:36:45,731 --> 02:36:46,564
weight and I was in Australia and I saw 
this painting and it just changed 

3975
02:36:48,071 --> 02:36:49,390
everything and I was just like,
wow.

3976
02:36:49,820 --> 02:36:51,340
Um,
it's uh,

3977
02:36:51,940 --> 02:36:52,773
oh,
it's,

3978
02:36:52,950 --> 02:36:56,890
it's since it's a picasso painting of 
this woman with a hat on her head,

3979
02:36:57,270 --> 02:36:58,630
um,
a Dutch hat,

3980
02:36:58,660 --> 02:37:00,880
it's um,
oh God.

3981
02:37:01,340 --> 02:37:03,610
Um,
and as well,

3982
02:37:03,680 --> 02:37:05,530
um,
I cannot remember the name of it.

3983
02:37:05,680 --> 02:37:09,040
I'm drawing a blank right here.
Eggs.

3984
02:37:09,041 --> 02:37:10,840
Think about eggs.
I think about eggs,

3985
02:37:11,230 --> 02:37:13,640
how eggs are prepared,
poached,

3986
02:37:13,641 --> 02:37:16,010
scramble and keep going.
Keep going.

3987
02:37:17,500 --> 02:37:19,150
Hollandaise,
uh,

3988
02:37:19,520 --> 02:37:21,860
was Moselle holidays.
He has something to that effect.

3989
02:37:21,861 --> 02:37:24,110
I believe I have the print in my room,
but now I just,

3990
02:37:24,111 --> 02:37:24,944
I don't look at the titles of things.
I just did the images more than 

3991
02:37:26,961 --> 02:37:27,794
anything.
And I saw this painting and I was in a 

3992
02:37:30,141 --> 02:37:33,140
museum in Australia and I was cutting 
weight for my fight.

3993
02:37:33,141 --> 02:37:33,974
I had all my sweats on,
but I was in an art museum and I saw it 

3994
02:37:35,211 --> 02:37:36,044
and I just,
I felt like it was talking to me all of 

3995
02:37:37,551 --> 02:37:40,490
a sudden and I was just like delirious.
Cause you were losing weight.

3996
02:37:41,060 --> 02:37:43,910
No,
but symbolically I know what you mean.

3997
02:37:43,911 --> 02:37:44,900
Like the symbolism there.

3998
02:37:44,900 --> 02:37:49,310
Like I was,
I was talking to myself.

3999
02:37:49,330 --> 02:37:50,020
Yeah,
that's it.

4000
02:37:50,020 --> 02:37:51,380
That's the painting.
Yeah.

4001
02:37:51,680 --> 02:37:55,070
And I just looked at that and yeah,
Labelle,

4002
02:37:55,080 --> 02:37:55,910
Hollandaise,
that's it.

4003
02:37:55,910 --> 02:37:57,890
Not memo sauce.
I suck at names.

4004
02:37:58,260 --> 02:37:59,001
Um,
that's another,

4005
02:37:59,001 --> 02:38:01,700
I have a very bad memory,
but I,

4006
02:38:01,701 --> 02:38:03,350
you know,
I looked at that and I just,

4007
02:38:03,680 --> 02:38:06,020
I connected with this painting and this 
weird,

4008
02:38:06,021 --> 02:38:06,854
weird way.
I just saw it and I couldn't stop 

4009
02:38:08,661 --> 02:38:10,790
talking to it in my head.
Like,

4010
02:38:10,820 --> 02:38:13,760
like there's this a person I'm talking 
to you now and it just,

4011
02:38:13,761 --> 02:38:15,270
and I wrote about this for it.
It was just like,

4012
02:38:15,271 --> 02:38:15,651
you know,
she's like,

4013
02:38:15,651 --> 02:38:16,640
Oh yeah,
you know what I'm done.

4014
02:38:17,150 --> 02:38:17,983
And I knew that in that museum,
just standing there looking at this 

4015
02:38:19,431 --> 02:38:20,810
painting before my fight.
Well,

4016
02:38:20,830 --> 02:38:23,130
you sure you weren't just looking for a 
sign.

4017
02:38:25,190 --> 02:38:26,023
Of course I was.
And it was just this beautiful image of 

4018
02:38:27,381 --> 02:38:28,730
this woman who's,
you know,

4019
02:38:28,731 --> 02:38:29,564
it doesn't look like a fighter.
It doesn't look at anything to do with 

4020
02:38:31,011 --> 02:38:32,930
combat is just a naked woman wearing a 
hat.

4021
02:38:33,170 --> 02:38:34,820
But all of a sudden it just,
to me,

4022
02:38:34,821 --> 02:38:35,654
that was what I was looking for.
I was looking for that sort of sign and 

4023
02:38:38,210 --> 02:38:41,990
that's where it became cohesive.
Like that's that moment.

4024
02:38:42,650 --> 02:38:45,200
And um,
I just knew I was done.

4025
02:38:45,920 --> 02:38:48,410
That's fascinating.
I think I'd been looking for excuses for

4026
02:38:48,411 --> 02:38:49,244
a long time before that.
And I think I wanted to retire before I 

4027
02:38:51,501 --> 02:38:53,180
fought Jermaine Duran to me,
you know,

4028
02:38:53,181 --> 02:38:54,170
like I,
I,

4029
02:38:54,530 --> 02:38:59,210
I was just so tired and I was just so,
my mind just wasn't going that direction

4030
02:38:59,211 --> 02:39:00,044
that other fighters,
you see that moment where you know that 

4031
02:39:02,781 --> 02:39:06,320
they're just sort of phoning it in and 
they can't figure out how to get off.

4032
02:39:06,650 --> 02:39:07,483
And for me it was like,
I would overtrain like before the 

4033
02:39:08,751 --> 02:39:09,584
Jermaine photos,
so overtrained and I was so tired and 

4034
02:39:12,360 --> 02:39:14,270
it's just like froze,
you know,

4035
02:39:14,271 --> 02:39:15,320
and stuff like that.
And I'll also,

4036
02:39:15,321 --> 02:39:16,154
she hit like a fucking mack truck,
but like she put me out on my feet in 

4037
02:39:18,531 --> 02:39:19,370
the third round it up,
fight.

4038
02:39:19,371 --> 02:39:20,990
Like she hit me with two right singer 
right hand.

4039
02:39:20,991 --> 02:39:23,030
I didn't know what was going on.
Like I was,

4040
02:39:23,640 --> 02:39:27,380
what did you think about her fight with 
holly?

4041
02:39:28,520 --> 02:39:29,950
So,
um,

4042
02:39:31,590 --> 02:39:33,200
I think it was terrible.
Horrible.

4043
02:39:33,590 --> 02:39:34,970
It was terrible.
I think that should have been called and

4044
02:39:34,980 --> 02:39:35,813
that should have been appointed acted.
And I don't mean that as an insult to 

4045
02:39:38,271 --> 02:39:40,730
Jermaine or anything like that,
that's combat minded or whatever.

4046
02:39:40,731 --> 02:39:43,910
But that's cheating.
Like 100% shooting and shit.

4047
02:39:44,530 --> 02:39:45,363
Yeah,
he was one of those shots and I think 

4048
02:39:47,251 --> 02:39:48,110
it's,
yeah,

4049
02:39:48,111 --> 02:39:50,000
I think it's something that she saw that
she could do.

4050
02:39:50,001 --> 02:39:51,970
And she did.
They're disappointed when they didn't.

4051
02:39:52,640 --> 02:39:54,140
They denied her protest.
Yeah,

4052
02:39:54,141 --> 02:39:55,520
me too.
I've protest.

4053
02:39:55,521 --> 02:39:56,354
That was a very legitimate honor.
That's not something in the hall has 

4054
02:39:59,001 --> 02:39:59,990
ever done before.
No,

4055
02:39:59,991 --> 02:40:01,070
she's not.
No,

4056
02:40:01,460 --> 02:40:02,293
she's,
and it's not like she doesn't accept a 

4057
02:40:03,071 --> 02:40:03,650
feat.
I mean,

4058
02:40:03,650 --> 02:40:05,780
she doesn't accept defeat as I will keep
moving forward,

4059
02:40:05,781 --> 02:40:06,830
but she's,
she wasn't,

4060
02:40:06,890 --> 02:40:07,723
she doesn't find excuses.
I've known that woman for almost a 

4061
02:40:10,040 --> 02:40:11,360
decade.
She doesn't look for excuses.

4062
02:40:11,361 --> 02:40:14,280
She looks for ways to improve and yeah,
so that,

4063
02:40:14,281 --> 02:40:15,114
you know,
hurt putting a protest in is very 

4064
02:40:17,131 --> 02:40:17,964
legitimate,

4065
02:40:18,070 --> 02:40:20,260
very legitimate.
And the Holly Holmes another one,

4066
02:40:20,261 --> 02:40:21,094
she's all heart.
I mean she came back from a deficit and 

4067
02:40:23,131 --> 02:40:24,870
that fight landed that,
that um,

4068
02:40:25,060 --> 02:40:29,200
question mark kick over the shoulder.
That was beautiful.

4069
02:40:29,780 --> 02:40:30,613
That was one of the best question mark 
kicks I've ever seen landed inside the 

4070
02:40:33,101 --> 02:40:33,934
octagon against a really tricky Moitai 
opponent who was getting the better of 

4071
02:40:36,941 --> 02:40:37,774
her early on.

4072
02:40:39,190 --> 02:40:40,023
Holly is,
I feel like the world hasn't even seen 

4073
02:40:42,601 --> 02:40:43,920
the best Holly Holm yet.
Um,

4074
02:40:44,280 --> 02:40:47,010
I know that sounds weird,
but she's 36,

4075
02:40:47,030 --> 02:40:48,780
right?
35.

4076
02:40:48,781 --> 02:40:51,960
I think that there's more to her though.
Potential.

4077
02:40:51,961 --> 02:40:53,700
Why is that?
That we haven't even seen yet.

4078
02:40:53,910 --> 02:40:55,530
But we'll see.
Like if that is going to,

4079
02:40:55,800 --> 02:40:57,090
I don't know what her plant,
I don't talk,

4080
02:40:57,090 --> 02:40:57,923
there's not a company we're talking 
about with The v tour thing though that 

4081
02:40:59,861 --> 02:41:02,070
it's almost like your,
your experience and your,

4082
02:41:02,280 --> 02:41:06,480
your ability and your knowledge gets 
overwhelmed by father time.

4083
02:41:06,481 --> 02:41:10,620
It's like father time and they come,
there's a cross in the road and you have

4084
02:41:10,621 --> 02:41:13,470
to figure out like how much experience 
do you have,

4085
02:41:13,471 --> 02:41:14,304
how much knowledge and whether or not 
your body can actually act on those 

4086
02:41:16,351 --> 02:41:17,184
things anymore.
And then it comes a point where they're 

4087
02:41:18,900 --> 02:41:19,640
just

4088
02:41:19,640 --> 02:41:20,101
I,
yeah.

4089
02:41:20,101 --> 02:41:21,840
And I don't know,
uh,

4090
02:41:22,320 --> 02:41:25,410
I'd say that's pretty early to say about
her in her mma career,

4091
02:41:25,411 --> 02:41:28,800
but she has had all that boxing and 
kickboxing experience before this maybe,

4092
02:41:28,801 --> 02:41:31,320
you know,
she has like,

4093
02:41:31,500 --> 02:41:34,950
ah Gosh,
she's so inspirational.

4094
02:41:35,120 --> 02:41:37,370
And she finds that she lost that one 
boxing match.

4095
02:41:37,540 --> 02:41:40,460
[inaudible] was so hard to watch.
Brutal and,

4096
02:41:40,461 --> 02:41:43,060
and the ref not horrible.
They should have stopped that fight.

4097
02:41:44,040 --> 02:41:45,000
Oh my God.
I know.

4098
02:41:45,001 --> 02:41:47,550
And her mentality coming out of that 
fight,

4099
02:41:48,010 --> 02:41:49,440
I had to be her sparring partner after 
that fight.

4100
02:41:49,441 --> 02:41:51,570
If that tells you which brand image I 
might have now.

4101
02:41:51,571 --> 02:41:54,150
But no,
I bet her mentality of not,

4102
02:41:54,210 --> 02:41:55,043
she refused to interact with people or 
have people corner heard that would 

4103
02:41:58,471 --> 02:42:00,660
doubt that she could win that fight in 
the future refused.

4104
02:42:01,200 --> 02:42:02,033
She,
she,

4105
02:42:02,170 --> 02:42:06,060
she is such a champion mind that no,
if people thought she would,

4106
02:42:06,061 --> 02:42:07,800
that she would take corrections,
she would take,

4107
02:42:07,801 --> 02:42:08,161
you know,
this,

4108
02:42:08,161 --> 02:42:09,870
I'm going to switch this,
this up.

4109
02:42:09,871 --> 02:42:10,704
I've got to do this differently.
But if you believe that she shouldn't 

4110
02:42:12,661 --> 02:42:14,760
have the rematch,
she wouldn't work with you.

4111
02:42:15,500 --> 02:42:16,560
Yeah.
Because she was like,

4112
02:42:16,561 --> 02:42:17,394
no,
I can't have somebody not believing in 

4113
02:42:18,271 --> 02:42:18,930
me.
I mean it was,

4114
02:42:18,930 --> 02:42:20,760
it was incredible.
It was very inspiration.

4115
02:42:21,670 --> 02:42:23,250
Yeah.
Did,

4116
02:42:24,170 --> 02:42:25,150
oh my gosh.
Yeah.

4117
02:42:25,210 --> 02:42:26,120
No,
she's a warrior.

4118
02:42:26,180 --> 02:42:27,830
No doubt about that.
Yeah.

4119
02:42:28,250 --> 02:42:31,310
So we only have a couple more minutes.
I've been talking so much.

4120
02:42:31,311 --> 02:42:32,144
I'm sorry you had a bunch of questions.
You still throw some months because I 

4121
02:42:34,311 --> 02:42:35,530
know you've got them written down.
It

4122
02:42:35,530 --> 02:42:37,660
was the,
I think when we went back to the,

4123
02:42:37,661 --> 02:42:39,340
and these are,
you know,

4124
02:42:39,341 --> 02:42:40,540
it's the shorthand,
but it was,

4125
02:42:40,800 --> 02:42:41,231
you know,
the who,

4126
02:42:41,231 --> 02:42:43,150
where are you when you started and who 
are you now?

4127
02:42:43,151 --> 02:42:43,984
And I guess what goes with that,
and I ask these questions because I've 

4128
02:42:47,171 --> 02:42:48,004
been asking them,
a lot of people in the sport or in this 

4129
02:42:49,601 --> 02:42:52,330
industry are people who are high level 
in what they're doing.

4130
02:42:53,410 --> 02:42:57,490
What,
what would you have left behind?

4131
02:42:58,060 --> 02:43:00,010
Like what,
what do you regret?

4132
02:43:00,011 --> 02:43:02,590
What would you have left behind in 
becoming who you are now?

4133
02:43:03,430 --> 02:43:05,140
What could you have changed?
And I don't need to,

4134
02:43:05,141 --> 02:43:07,690
it's a hard question to ask because 
nobody wants to look baton rouge.

4135
02:43:07,840 --> 02:43:10,000
Oh I regret this because we learned from
our regrets.

4136
02:43:10,001 --> 02:43:11,020
Right?
But if there's,

4137
02:43:11,320 --> 02:43:12,100
you could,
if you

4138
02:43:12,100 --> 02:43:13,960
could have changed,
you could have done differently.

4139
02:43:13,961 --> 02:43:14,580
Would you have,

4140
02:43:14,580 --> 02:43:17,010
I think all of my errors of made me a 
better person.

4141
02:43:17,070 --> 02:43:19,110
So I don't think they're bad.
You know?

4142
02:43:19,111 --> 02:43:21,540
I think you mean that's a real cliche 
thing.

4143
02:43:21,541 --> 02:43:23,910
You don't,
you don't make mistakes or you,

4144
02:43:23,911 --> 02:43:25,290
if you do make mistakes,
you learn.

4145
02:43:25,320 --> 02:43:27,540
If you don't make mistakes,
you grow and you improve.

4146
02:43:27,570 --> 02:43:30,180
I mean like it's all good.
If you look,

4147
02:43:30,190 --> 02:43:31,530
it's,
it's not what happens.

4148
02:43:31,531 --> 02:43:32,640
It's how you react to what happened

4149
02:43:32,820 --> 02:43:36,600
and what one mistake do you think like 
really defined you to make you better?

4150
02:43:36,750 --> 02:43:38,040
Oh Geez.
Not One.

4151
02:43:38,160 --> 02:43:39,480
It's just a bunch of them.
I mean,

4152
02:43:40,260 --> 02:43:41,520
God,
there's a million of them.

4153
02:43:42,060 --> 02:43:44,130
There's nowhere to even start.
You know what I mean?

4154
02:43:44,131 --> 02:43:44,964
You're just constantly make mistakes.
You make mistakes with your friends and 

4155
02:43:46,921 --> 02:43:47,754
make mistakes with the people you're 
involved with romantically you mixed 

4156
02:43:50,611 --> 02:43:54,210
mistakes careerwise and make mistakes 
with comedy and art,

4157
02:43:54,211 --> 02:43:56,850
you're constantly,
it's a constant process of mistakes,

4158
02:43:57,380 --> 02:43:58,980
you know?
Especially when you're writing new stuff

4159
02:43:58,981 --> 02:44:00,840
with Jujitsu,
there's constant mistakes,

4160
02:44:00,841 --> 02:44:01,674
you know what I mean?
I think testing yourself and constantly 

4161
02:44:06,271 --> 02:44:11,271
seeking improvement and constantly 
trying to expand upon your creative work

4162
02:44:13,350 --> 02:44:15,210
and expand upon,
you know,

4163
02:44:15,211 --> 02:44:15,870
what,
what you're,

4164
02:44:15,870 --> 02:44:19,190
what you're doing as a martial artist or
what you're doing as an athlete or what,

4165
02:44:19,270 --> 02:44:20,760
you know,
improving upon your,

4166
02:44:21,000 --> 02:44:24,000
your conditioning drills and trying to 
advance in Yoga,

4167
02:44:24,180 --> 02:44:25,800
get better at that.
And I just,

4168
02:44:25,801 --> 02:44:28,470
I'm always doing something that I'm 
failing in.

4169
02:44:28,800 --> 02:44:30,680
I mean,
I think that's a big part of it.

4170
02:44:30,681 --> 02:44:33,070
I like doing new things and socking at 
them.

4171
02:44:33,071 --> 02:44:34,190
Yeah,
I think that's good too.

4172
02:44:34,440 --> 02:44:36,250
What,
so in that,

4173
02:44:36,280 --> 02:44:37,870
in that vein,
I guess of reasoning,

4174
02:44:37,900 --> 02:44:40,840
what do you carry into this like,
I mean,

4175
02:44:41,170 --> 02:44:42,820
I don't know the exact numbers of your 
podcast,

4176
02:44:42,821 --> 02:44:43,840
but it's huge,
right?

4177
02:44:43,841 --> 02:44:46,090
Like I mean you get huge amount of 
downloads.

4178
02:44:46,410 --> 02:44:47,243
I'm your number one or in the top at 
least the top five all the time for you 

4179
02:44:50,861 --> 02:44:51,551
know,
whatever pot.

4180
02:44:51,551 --> 02:44:52,384
But,
so what do you carry into this space 

4181
02:44:53,831 --> 02:44:56,290
with people that you don't want to leave
behind?

4182
02:44:56,350 --> 02:44:57,183
Like what is it that you think you bring
to this that I don't want to leave 

4183
02:44:59,231 --> 02:45:02,080
behind like that.
Do you carried since you were young,

4184
02:45:02,081 --> 02:45:02,914
since you first started in the 
entertainment industry or an in mma or 

4185
02:45:04,991 --> 02:45:05,824
in Jujitsu,
what part of Joe do you bring into this 

4186
02:45:08,531 --> 02:45:10,080
space and that you continue to bring 
that?

4187
02:45:10,340 --> 02:45:11,173
I definitely don't think about that,
but if there was anything it would be 

4188
02:45:13,570 --> 02:45:14,403
genuine curiosity I have,
I've genuinely curious about things and 

4189
02:45:17,471 --> 02:45:19,630
I'm trying to make this as entertaining 
as possible.

4190
02:45:19,631 --> 02:45:24,280
So I do my best to try to make the 
conversation flow as,

4191
02:45:24,430 --> 02:45:25,263
and I don't always succeed.
I fail all the time and that failure 

4192
02:45:27,791 --> 02:45:28,624
makes me try better.
I definitely think I'm better at 

4193
02:45:29,831 --> 02:45:30,664
podcasting now than I was six months ago
and better six months ago then it was a 

4194
02:45:33,550 --> 02:45:34,383
year ago and then I hope I'll be better 
a year from now that I am today and 

4195
02:45:36,371 --> 02:45:37,204
that's just

4196
02:45:37,500 --> 02:45:38,700
beck is fail,
fail,

4197
02:45:38,940 --> 02:45:40,210
fail better all the

4198
02:45:40,210 --> 02:45:41,560
time.
But there's also,

4199
02:45:41,561 --> 02:45:42,394
this isn't in a weird way,
it's an audio art form and it doesn't 

4200
02:45:46,391 --> 02:45:47,224
seem like it is,
but the art of conversation is there's 

4201
02:45:49,571 --> 02:45:50,230
a,
there's an art,

4202
02:45:50,230 --> 02:45:52,420
there's an interaction to it and you're 
very good at it,

4203
02:45:52,421 --> 02:45:53,254
which is one of the reasons why you 
apologize when you accidentally talk 

4204
02:45:55,001 --> 02:45:57,340
over each other.
But that's a part of human interaction.

4205
02:45:57,380 --> 02:46:00,070
We talk over each other,
we accidentally do or sometimes you have

4206
02:46:00,071 --> 02:46:02,290
a point that you feel like you have to 
get in now or just forget it.

4207
02:46:02,590 --> 02:46:03,423
I mean and it's,
it's a matter of like how to do it the 

4208
02:46:05,081 --> 02:46:05,914
right way.
And one of the things that I've found 

4209
02:46:07,151 --> 02:46:09,950
from doing podcasts is how bad are at 
that.

4210
02:46:10,160 --> 02:46:10,993
It's really frustrating to talk to 
really a self centered people that just 

4211
02:46:14,691 --> 02:46:15,524
talk over everyone and don't listen to 
what anybody has to say and aren't 

4212
02:46:18,590 --> 02:46:19,423
genuinely listening.
They're just waiting for their chain to 

4213
02:46:20,991 --> 02:46:22,120
talk.
I mean that,

4214
02:46:22,250 --> 02:46:23,083
that is really frustrating and it's,
you realize the art of conversation is 

4215
02:46:27,651 --> 02:46:30,260
something that's cultivated.
It's something that you,

4216
02:46:30,261 --> 02:46:31,094
you have to work on.
And there are a lot of people just 

4217
02:46:32,721 --> 02:46:33,860
don't,
they're not good at it

4218
02:46:34,630 --> 02:46:37,060
cause you have to,
you have to be aware that you're weaving

4219
02:46:37,061 --> 02:46:39,610
something into a bigger picture as 
opposed to yeah.

4220
02:46:39,611 --> 02:46:42,070
As opposed to just saying what you're 
saying and then walking out.

4221
02:46:42,100 --> 02:46:43,300
Yeah.
Yeah.

4222
02:46:43,450 --> 02:46:44,283
Listening is huge.
I think you're a very good listener and 

4223
02:46:46,211 --> 02:46:47,044
I think that that's like,
that's what I see from the outside that 

4224
02:46:49,210 --> 02:46:51,700
you're able to do well.
And I'd love to emulate you as a,

4225
02:46:51,740 --> 02:46:54,490
as a commentator in that sense,
and you is creating this space.

4226
02:46:54,710 --> 02:46:55,540
I,
I'd love to,

4227
02:46:55,540 --> 02:46:56,373
to model a certain amount of myself 
after that because I think it's 

4228
02:46:58,211 --> 02:46:59,470
wonderful.
But,

4229
02:46:59,471 --> 02:47:02,260
um,
so I mean,

4230
02:47:02,320 --> 02:47:03,153
any huge regrets,
not meaning you don't have to share 

4231
02:47:04,661 --> 02:47:05,494
them,
but any,

4232
02:47:05,580 --> 02:47:06,820
does anything keep you up at night?

4233
02:47:06,920 --> 02:47:08,720
No.
No.

4234
02:47:08,840 --> 02:47:09,860
I mean,
if,

4235
02:47:09,861 --> 02:47:10,694
uh,
there's many things in my life that if 

4236
02:47:11,571 --> 02:47:12,404
they were presented in front of me right
now learning that I've done them in the 

4237
02:47:14,061 --> 02:47:16,040
past and fucked up,
I would do it differently.

4238
02:47:16,041 --> 02:47:17,780
But that's part of being who you are 
today.

4239
02:47:18,260 --> 02:47:19,093
I think people,
that word regret is a very dangerous 

4240
02:47:21,171 --> 02:47:25,910
word because people far too often define
themselves by their past failures.

4241
02:47:25,980 --> 02:47:30,110
Instead of saying that that's not you.
Like you're not that person.

4242
02:47:30,111 --> 02:47:33,410
You're you right now.
And that's what I really truly believe.

4243
02:47:33,411 --> 02:47:34,244
I believe that you are all of your 
experiences and in life and all of the 

4244
02:47:38,091 --> 02:47:38,924
data that you've acquired and all the 
revelations and understandings that 

4245
02:47:41,311 --> 02:47:45,800
we've gathered up because of those 
positive and negative experiences.

4246
02:47:45,801 --> 02:47:47,810
And that creates who you are at this 
moment.

4247
02:47:48,140 --> 02:47:51,110
And the most interesting people to me 
are the people that have been tested,

4248
02:47:51,111 --> 02:47:52,970
that have gone through trials and 
tribulations.

4249
02:47:52,970 --> 02:47:56,090
And it's one of the reasons why fighters
are so interesting because the emotional

4250
02:47:56,091 --> 02:47:56,924
rollercoaster of a fight camp and then 
fighting and competing and not just an 

4251
02:48:00,830 --> 02:48:03,900
mma,
but people that do Jujitsu and uh,

4252
02:48:04,220 --> 02:48:08,090
boxers and just people that have done 
something that's very difficult to do.

4253
02:48:08,360 --> 02:48:11,210
You've tested yourself in a way that 
very few people have.

4254
02:48:11,390 --> 02:48:14,210
And so you understand yourself in a much
deeper way.

4255
02:48:14,480 --> 02:48:16,370
You understand where that breaking point
is.

4256
02:48:16,371 --> 02:48:18,230
You understand what happens when you 
break.

4257
02:48:18,500 --> 02:48:21,350
You understand who the demons are and 
your mind to tell you to break.

4258
02:48:21,860 --> 02:48:22,693
You know,
and some people never meet those demons 

4259
02:48:24,291 --> 02:48:25,400
and they're there.
They're waiting,

4260
02:48:25,401 --> 02:48:26,234
they're waiting for the call.
They're waiting for that fucking button 

4261
02:48:27,811 --> 02:48:31,010
to be pushed so they can pop up into 
your brain and wreck havoc.

4262
02:48:31,011 --> 02:48:31,844
Yeah.
Some people just want to fight those 

4263
02:48:32,451 --> 02:48:34,000
demons and the family,
they make them up.

4264
02:48:34,010 --> 02:48:35,660
Sure.
They make their own demons up.

4265
02:48:35,661 --> 02:48:38,060
They create problems,
they create stress.

4266
02:48:38,570 --> 02:48:41,090
And you know,
sometimes they invoke those demons.

4267
02:48:41,091 --> 02:48:41,924
They asked those demons to come in and 
distract them from all the real issues 

4268
02:48:44,211 --> 02:48:45,044
that they have in their life and all the
things that they actually do need to 

4269
02:48:46,911 --> 02:48:47,744
deal with.
All the real work that the pain of the 

4270
02:48:50,751 --> 02:48:51,930
mundane,
the f,

4271
02:48:51,980 --> 02:48:52,813
the pain of the boring discipline work 
is sometimes so great that people does 

4272
02:48:58,430 --> 02:48:59,263
mean.
That's why some providers wind up 

4273
02:49:00,381 --> 02:49:02,930
fucking off and getting drunk and never 
coming to,

4274
02:49:03,200 --> 02:49:06,620
to work out and wind up being in poor 
shape and the fight comes off.

4275
02:49:06,740 --> 02:49:09,510
It's not because they didn't know the 
fight was coming.

4276
02:49:09,511 --> 02:49:10,770
He's not the cause.
There are a coward.

4277
02:49:10,771 --> 02:49:11,604
It's because they're,
they're letting their demons trip them 

4278
02:49:13,081 --> 02:49:13,910
up.

4279
02:49:13,910 --> 02:49:17,000
I think boredom and that not listening 
aspect.

4280
02:49:17,001 --> 02:49:19,060
I think that it's also connected.
Um,

4281
02:49:19,490 --> 02:49:20,440
no.
You,

4282
02:49:20,660 --> 02:49:21,493
yeah,
and that leads people down paths where 

4283
02:49:24,470 --> 02:49:26,060
they can't get back from it.
Sure.

4284
02:49:26,090 --> 02:49:27,950
Unfortunate.
That's a,

4285
02:49:28,640 --> 02:49:29,473
yeah.
I think when we lament the loss of 

4286
02:49:31,791 --> 02:49:32,624
somebody who's potential,
it's not always because they were doing 

4287
02:49:34,941 --> 02:49:36,710
the wrong things or they lost the wrong 
fight,

4288
02:49:36,711 --> 02:49:39,530
but it's because they never recognized 
where they can move on from there.

4289
02:49:39,560 --> 02:49:40,393
Yeah.

4290
02:49:40,570 --> 02:49:44,710
And exploring that.
Your personal sovereignty,

4291
02:49:45,010 --> 02:49:45,843
exploring your ability to truly manage 
all of these very difficult scenarios 

4292
02:49:49,931 --> 02:49:50,764
that present themselves in life is one 
of the most interesting and fascinating 

4293
02:49:53,231 --> 02:49:54,064
things about studying human beings.
And to me it's like the exact opposite 

4294
02:49:57,281 --> 02:49:58,114
of the mob mentality when you're swept 
away in this group think and you're 

4295
02:50:00,821 --> 02:50:01,654
really not responsible for yourself and 
your thinking and it's very almost 

4296
02:50:04,601 --> 02:50:07,720
selfish way of giving into this thing.
It's too easy.

4297
02:50:07,721 --> 02:50:09,280
It's too easy.
There's so many people around.

4298
02:50:09,340 --> 02:50:10,510
Ah,
just go crazy.

4299
02:50:10,770 --> 02:50:13,270
I was like the opposite of like the 
lone,

4300
02:50:13,271 --> 02:50:15,760
one of the reasons why I didn't never 
really was into team sports.

4301
02:50:16,060 --> 02:50:17,920
I was like,
I understand that it's a challenge.

4302
02:50:17,921 --> 02:50:18,754
I understand that it's difficult,
but there's an intensity of the one on 

4303
02:50:22,721 --> 02:50:25,990
one competition that cannot be matched 
in any other forum.

4304
02:50:26,230 --> 02:50:28,720
Whether it's even,
it's one on one playing tennis.

4305
02:50:29,050 --> 02:50:29,883
It's so much more intense than a group 
game of volleyball or basketball or 

4306
02:50:33,281 --> 02:50:33,770
whatever.

4307
02:50:33,770 --> 02:50:34,603
I would say to that though,
given because you are who you are and 

4308
02:50:38,121 --> 02:50:40,910
you've built so many quote unquote 
followers,

4309
02:50:40,911 --> 02:50:42,770
he built so many people who listen to 
your opinion.

4310
02:50:43,040 --> 02:50:46,790
You are in a sense on a team and you are
a leader because so many people download

4311
02:50:46,791 --> 02:50:47,624
your podcast.
So many people want to enter this space 

4312
02:50:48,861 --> 02:50:49,694
that you create.
So do you feel a responsibility to them 

4313
02:50:51,801 --> 02:50:54,000
to tell them to think for themselves?
Okay.

4314
02:50:54,590 --> 02:50:57,480
Hope people just figure that out on 
their own because there's no way anybody

4315
02:50:57,481 --> 02:50:58,480
could think for you.
Right,

4316
02:50:58,481 --> 02:50:58,980
right,
right.

4317
02:50:58,980 --> 02:51:01,680
But I do allow people to think for me in
a certain way.

4318
02:51:01,890 --> 02:51:04,770
Like when I listen to someone,
like if I listened to a book on tape,

4319
02:51:05,270 --> 02:51:07,380
um,
or I listen to a lecture,

4320
02:51:07,410 --> 02:51:08,243
what I'm listening to is I'm allowing 
this person to direct my thoughts with 

4321
02:51:12,091 --> 02:51:14,490
their words,
their painting pictures.

4322
02:51:14,491 --> 02:51:15,324
They're explaining facts,
they're going over their own personal 

4323
02:51:17,281 --> 02:51:18,114
experiences.
And you are in many ways allowing that 

4324
02:51:21,901 --> 02:51:24,750
person to think for you.
But then when that's over,

4325
02:51:24,751 --> 02:51:29,160
you think for yourself and you take into
account what that person has said and it

4326
02:51:29,161 --> 02:51:29,994
can enhance your perceptions.
Because if someone's being honest with 

4327
02:51:31,861 --> 02:51:32,694
you,
which I think is one of the most 

4328
02:51:32,851 --> 02:51:35,190
important parts of being,
of expressing yourself,

4329
02:51:35,191 --> 02:51:37,290
I would like to know what your real 
motivations are.

4330
02:51:37,290 --> 02:51:38,610
I want to know what your real thoughts 
are.

4331
02:51:38,611 --> 02:51:41,820
I don't want you to pretend,
I don't want you to be a politician.

4332
02:51:41,821 --> 02:51:42,654
I don't want you to just give me some 
bullshit version of who you are because 

4333
02:51:45,241 --> 02:51:46,860
you think I'm going to like you more 
from that.

4334
02:51:47,060 --> 02:51:50,880
And I think people can tell when 
someone's doing that,

4335
02:51:50,910 --> 02:51:51,743
right?
And I think when someone's not doing 

4336
02:51:53,221 --> 02:51:54,480
that,
when someone's being genuine,

4337
02:51:54,481 --> 02:51:55,740
people cling to it and they go,
look,

4338
02:51:55,741 --> 02:51:57,120
maybe he doesn't know what the fuck he's
doing,

4339
02:51:57,330 --> 02:51:59,940
but maybe he's being honest about it and
I'll find out together.

4340
02:51:59,941 --> 02:52:00,774
We'll figure it out together.
Because at least this dude's telling me 

4341
02:52:02,191 --> 02:52:03,660
the truth,
or she's telling me the truth.

4342
02:52:03,661 --> 02:52:04,321
Or,
you know,

4343
02:52:04,321 --> 02:52:06,220
this group,
an honest group.

4344
02:52:06,550 --> 02:52:08,860
That's what I think we belong for in 
this life because this is,

4345
02:52:08,861 --> 02:52:09,694
life is so filled with joy,
dramatic interpretations of reality and 

4346
02:52:12,741 --> 02:52:15,430
yeah,
and so there's so much just bullshit,

4347
02:52:15,610 --> 02:52:16,443
but it's,
it's hard to find truth and we seek 

4348
02:52:18,551 --> 02:52:19,510
truth,
I think.

4349
02:52:19,930 --> 02:52:20,763
I think truth is sought in combat.
I think there's a lot of people that 

4350
02:52:23,441 --> 02:52:24,274
seek truth and watching mma,
like when we're talking about that 

4351
02:52:26,321 --> 02:52:29,080
Darren Elkins fight,
there's no truer moment in the world and

4352
02:52:29,081 --> 02:52:32,410
this guy digging deep and find me.
It's as raw as it gets.

4353
02:52:32,411 --> 02:52:35,670
His face is covered in blood.
He can't even fucking see that's a,

4354
02:52:35,700 --> 02:52:37,720
there's a truth in that.
That's an escapable.

4355
02:52:37,721 --> 02:52:40,720
You can't dance your way out of it.
You can't bullshit your way out of him.

4356
02:52:40,900 --> 02:52:45,210
Spotlights and glitter and fucking hype 
music desk.

4357
02:52:45,280 --> 02:52:46,390
There's none of that.
It's a,

4358
02:52:46,391 --> 02:52:49,080
it's,
it's down to this,

4359
02:52:49,230 --> 02:52:50,063
this inescapable reality.
And I think when people are confronted 

4360
02:52:53,561 --> 02:52:54,394
with all the trials and tribulations of 
life and there's so much confusion and 

4361
02:52:57,521 --> 02:52:58,354
we seek inspiration in so many different
avenues and we seek leadership and we 

4362
02:53:01,031 --> 02:53:04,810
seek mentorship.
And we seek like this,

4363
02:53:04,811 --> 02:53:05,644
this hope,
hopefully this light out there that 

4364
02:53:07,961 --> 02:53:08,794
guides us in some sort of a way and one 
of the only ways that we can really 

4365
02:53:12,881 --> 02:53:13,714
truly trust that light as if we know 
it's coming from a person that has 

4366
02:53:16,511 --> 02:53:18,280
committed to the path of honesty.
Right,

4367
02:53:18,910 --> 02:53:19,743
right.
So what are your tools for discernment 

4368
02:53:20,981 --> 02:53:23,110
in that?
Just don't bullshit myself.

4369
02:53:23,180 --> 02:53:24,013
Yeah,
it's really,

4370
02:53:25,240 --> 02:53:29,050
manipulation is so easy to fall into it.
It's also so easy to,

4371
02:53:29,230 --> 02:53:31,840
to just resent everybody about then too,
like yeah,

4372
02:53:31,960 --> 02:53:33,650
I teach rhetoric,
so like we,

4373
02:53:33,651 --> 02:53:35,290
we consider a text and we're just like,
okay,

4374
02:53:35,291 --> 02:53:37,330
who's the speaker?
What is the text?

4375
02:53:37,570 --> 02:53:38,320
What is,
you know,

4376
02:53:38,320 --> 02:53:40,690
what is the message in the tax?
Like what are they trying to say?

4377
02:53:40,691 --> 02:53:44,190
And then what is this huge like myths 
surrounding all of them.

4378
02:53:44,800 --> 02:53:46,180
What are they trying to do here?
And it's,

4379
02:53:46,420 --> 02:53:49,090
it's so interesting to see kids' minds 
change about like,

4380
02:53:49,120 --> 02:53:49,953
oh,
I don't actually have to believe this 

4381
02:53:50,741 --> 02:53:54,430
because this is what I've been assigned,
or I do have to think a certain way or I

4382
02:53:54,431 --> 02:53:55,264
have to consider the source.
I begin gets it's kind of a rabbit hole 

4383
02:53:57,761 --> 02:53:58,450
sometimes.

4384
02:53:58,450 --> 02:53:59,110
Yes.
You know,

4385
02:53:59,110 --> 02:54:03,010
that's where in my mind,
like the true was religion to me.

4386
02:54:03,011 --> 02:54:03,844
Like,
or whatever you want to call religion 

4387
02:54:04,421 --> 02:54:05,231
is,
is it's science.

4388
02:54:05,231 --> 02:54:07,040
I just think science is that the,
um,

4389
02:54:07,250 --> 02:54:08,083
the scientific method is based on so 
much philosophy so much and it's trying 

4390
02:54:11,711 --> 02:54:13,720
to fail all the time.
Like that's what he's,

4391
02:54:13,721 --> 02:54:14,554
he's like repeatable results.
If you can't get repeatable like 

4392
02:54:16,630 --> 02:54:18,730
results,
like blind results on something,

4393
02:54:18,760 --> 02:54:21,340
then that's what you're always trying to
do and you're always failing.

4394
02:54:21,560 --> 02:54:23,170
But you know,
I come from a family scientists,

4395
02:54:23,171 --> 02:54:24,430
so of course,
like that's a,

4396
02:54:24,840 --> 02:54:25,810
you know,
for me it's just,

4397
02:54:25,811 --> 02:54:27,550
it's what I love more than anything is 
to,

4398
02:54:27,580 --> 02:54:29,350
to hear them talk about how to find 
truth.

4399
02:54:29,650 --> 02:54:31,210
And then truth is also different from 
fact.

4400
02:54:31,480 --> 02:54:32,490
And so when you go down,
Kay,

4401
02:54:32,491 --> 02:54:34,330
is it truth or is it fact or is it a 
painting?

4402
02:54:34,331 --> 02:54:36,400
Like what's going on here?
It gets really,

4403
02:54:36,401 --> 02:54:40,720
I'm finding tools for discernment.
That's really,

4404
02:54:40,810 --> 02:54:44,380
that becomes really tricky and I think 
that's where a hive mine comes from.

4405
02:54:44,381 --> 02:54:45,580
Right.
You know,

4406
02:54:45,581 --> 02:54:47,500
like people not trying to grab those 
tools,

4407
02:54:47,501 --> 02:54:48,334
not trying to assess their own 
motivations for latching on to thinking 

4408
02:54:50,621 --> 02:54:51,271
that this is right.
Right.

4409
02:54:51,271 --> 02:54:52,960
Yeah.
They just want their team to win.

4410
02:54:53,290 --> 02:54:54,123
And it's also absorbing information and 
sort of formulating your own viewpoint 

4411
02:54:57,401 --> 02:55:00,310
takes time.
It takes a long time.

4412
02:55:00,311 --> 02:55:04,250
And who you are today is going to be 
different than who you are 10 years from

4413
02:55:04,251 --> 02:55:05,084
now.
And that's something that you'd have to 

4414
02:55:05,661 --> 02:55:07,870
kind of embrace and you know,
be be,

4415
02:55:07,930 --> 02:55:11,210
it's,
it's hard to think it in the moment,

4416
02:55:11,211 --> 02:55:13,250
but be happy for those uncomfortable 
moments.

4417
02:55:13,251 --> 02:55:14,084
Yeah.
Cause those uncomfortable moments or 

4418
02:55:14,961 --> 02:55:15,770
that you learned from,

4419
02:55:15,770 --> 02:55:16,820
yeah,
you have to be wrong.

4420
02:55:16,821 --> 02:55:19,370
You have to seek being wrong as much as 
possible.

4421
02:55:19,371 --> 02:55:20,204
Right.
And you have to see things that maybe 

4422
02:55:21,500 --> 02:55:24,700
change the way you look at things and 
experienced things,

4423
02:55:25,180 --> 02:55:26,840
change your,
your boundaries,

4424
02:55:26,841 --> 02:55:29,630
change your perceptions.
One of the things I worry the most for,

4425
02:55:29,631 --> 02:55:33,290
I think as a country for us that we get 
so comfortable that,

4426
02:55:33,320 --> 02:55:34,460
oh,
we're soft as fuck.

4427
02:55:34,560 --> 02:55:36,290
And you know,
and I don't even mean,

4428
02:55:36,320 --> 02:55:37,153
I don't even mean soft as in like puppy 
shit in a plastic bag just because I 

4429
02:55:43,401 --> 02:55:45,170
don't know what it is about like,
and it's,

4430
02:55:45,500 --> 02:55:46,333
it's again,
I do believe what you said about 

4431
02:55:48,441 --> 02:55:50,810
individualism and doing your own thing 
and striking,

4432
02:55:50,811 --> 02:55:51,644
you know,
forging your own path and stuff like 

4433
02:55:52,341 --> 02:55:54,740
that.
But our inability somehow to,

4434
02:55:54,741 --> 02:55:57,320
um,
to commit ourselves to learning.

4435
02:55:57,670 --> 02:55:58,880
Yeah.
But it's not everybody.

4436
02:55:58,881 --> 02:56:00,950
A lot of with car,
you're committed to learning.

4437
02:56:01,010 --> 02:56:03,260
I'm committed to learning and that's a 
lot of people listening to this,

4438
02:56:03,261 --> 02:56:04,340
to the committed to learn.
Yeah.

4439
02:56:04,341 --> 02:56:05,420
I hope so.
Like I,

4440
02:56:05,421 --> 02:56:06,140
I'm,
I'm,

4441
02:56:06,140 --> 02:56:08,300
I'm banking on that because I actually 
believe in people.

4442
02:56:08,301 --> 02:56:10,990
Like I believe that people are good.
I believe you believe that.

4443
02:56:12,490 --> 02:56:13,290
I think the group

4444
02:56:13,290 --> 02:56:15,120
think thing is,
is real.

4445
02:56:15,121 --> 02:56:19,130
And what you're talking about is real.
But I also think that when,

4446
02:56:19,180 --> 02:56:23,700
when you're judging 350 million people,
it's impossible to generalize,

4447
02:56:23,730 --> 02:56:25,950
right?
When you say as a country we're soft,

4448
02:56:25,951 --> 02:56:27,030
we're getting our shit.
Yeah,

4449
02:56:27,060 --> 02:56:28,260
we're soft,
we're right.

4450
02:56:28,290 --> 02:56:30,210
A lot of us are.
If you look overall,

4451
02:56:30,360 --> 02:56:32,370
if you looked at the pie chart of soft 
people,

4452
02:56:32,371 --> 02:56:33,121
I go,
oh fuck.

4453
02:56:33,121 --> 02:56:36,930
Look how soft we are through the Pi part
of pie chart of ignorant people.

4454
02:56:36,931 --> 02:56:38,400
Yo,
look how ignorant we are.

4455
02:56:38,670 --> 02:56:39,503
But in that pie chart,
in defining people and that sort of a 

4456
02:56:42,871 --> 02:56:45,070
broad generalization,
you,

4457
02:56:45,080 --> 02:56:45,913
you lose the beauty of individuality.
And that's one of the things that's 

4458
02:56:49,050 --> 02:56:49,883
unique about us is that we have the 
ability in this country to to seek out 

4459
02:56:54,540 --> 02:56:58,380
all sorts of different paths to be who 
you would choose to be,

4460
02:56:58,381 --> 02:56:59,214
to follow whatever occupation or 
whatever path of interest that you 

4461
02:57:03,870 --> 02:57:05,400
choose to follow.
And I think that's,

4462
02:57:05,820 --> 02:57:08,210
that's a beautiful thing.
It's an amazing thing.

4463
02:57:08,540 --> 02:57:09,373
It is a beautiful thing.
I don't think those opportunities are 

4464
02:57:10,821 --> 02:57:13,640
available to everybody in a lot of 
senses.

4465
02:57:13,680 --> 02:57:14,513
And that's just through my own 
experience of becoming a fighter and 

4466
02:57:16,101 --> 02:57:17,870
having to struggle to be a female 
fighter,

4467
02:57:18,170 --> 02:57:19,520
you know,
that makes me think of,

4468
02:57:20,060 --> 02:57:23,120
I'm actually privileged to have been 
able to make that decision.

4469
02:57:23,150 --> 02:57:24,080
And you know,
the,

4470
02:57:24,081 --> 02:57:24,914
the female fighters after me,
I think benefit from me making the 

4471
02:57:26,431 --> 02:57:29,180
decision and from other fighters like me
making that decision because sure,

4472
02:57:29,210 --> 02:57:30,043
it's moved on.
But I do think that when we look at 

4473
02:57:32,361 --> 02:57:34,040
society and we talk about,
I don't know,

4474
02:57:34,041 --> 02:57:36,110
being soft or not being soft at,
sometimes people just,

4475
02:57:36,530 --> 02:57:37,363
they can't pull themselves up from their
bootstraps if they don't know where the 

4476
02:57:39,381 --> 02:57:41,330
fuck their boots are or where they 
trained them.

4477
02:57:41,580 --> 02:57:41,900
Well,
like,

4478
02:57:41,900 --> 02:57:45,110
and I do think there's so many,
there's so much divisiveness and I think

4479
02:57:45,111 --> 02:57:46,880
that's what leads to,
and I'm,

4480
02:57:47,000 --> 02:57:50,090
I'm a fucking perpetuate or of that.
Like when I go off on,

4481
02:57:50,091 --> 02:57:50,924
you know,
this fucking Maggot guys and this and 

4482
02:57:52,341 --> 02:57:52,581
that,
you know,

4483
02:57:52,581 --> 02:57:53,414
I go nuts sometimes I,
I fall into that anger and I wish I 

4484
02:57:55,581 --> 02:57:57,250
didn't,
but then don't,

4485
02:57:57,650 --> 02:58:00,710
well that's what,
that's what therapies for it.

4486
02:58:00,711 --> 02:58:02,310
Right.
I like a good fight.

4487
02:58:02,311 --> 02:58:03,750
I do.
I like a good fight.

4488
02:58:04,050 --> 02:58:04,980
I do.
Oh,

4489
02:58:05,170 --> 02:58:05,660
would

4490
02:58:05,660 --> 02:58:06,493
say to you as a friend that I think 
you'd probably be better off expressing 

4491
02:58:09,681 --> 02:58:12,020
that aggressive energy in some sort of 
another outlet.

4492
02:58:12,050 --> 02:58:12,883
I believe you end up interacting with 
strangers because another thing about 

4493
02:58:16,311 --> 02:58:17,144
some of those people that you're 
interacting with are fucking losers and 

4494
02:58:19,341 --> 02:58:20,174
they will lock onto you and they find 
out that you are a source of 

4495
02:58:22,311 --> 02:58:23,144
entertainment where they could press 
your buttons and make you dance and 

4496
02:58:25,821 --> 02:58:26,840
they'll,
they'll keep doing it.

4497
02:58:26,841 --> 02:58:28,130
And that's what trolling is all about.

4498
02:58:28,260 --> 02:58:33,260
It is a phenomenal art form.
This trolling that they've taken.

4499
02:58:34,061 --> 02:58:34,960
I mean it's,
it's great.

4500
02:58:34,961 --> 02:58:37,450
I mean the best thing I've ever 
discovered is my mute button.

4501
02:58:37,451 --> 02:58:39,250
Not even blocking people but just muting
people.

4502
02:58:39,730 --> 02:58:40,563
And also,
I mean actually the best thing I've 

4503
02:58:41,651 --> 02:58:44,800
discovered is that like I have to take 
my phone and physically put it away from

4504
02:58:44,801 --> 02:58:45,634
me and then I can write and I get into 
that zone and it feels wonderful and 

4505
02:58:47,730 --> 02:58:50,020
it's just like putting the phone away 
and just putting it down,

4506
02:58:50,021 --> 02:58:51,620
disconnecting.
But you don't want to be,

4507
02:58:51,680 --> 02:58:52,513
I want to connect with people.
I love that twitter has done it's big 

4508
02:58:54,701 --> 02:58:55,730
great friendships from it.
Yeah,

4509
02:58:55,900 --> 02:58:56,441
for sure.
Well,

4510
02:58:56,441 --> 02:58:58,360
one of the beautiful things about doing 
podcasts,

4511
02:58:58,361 --> 02:58:59,194
one of the things it's taught me is that
I don't ever have three hour 

4512
02:59:01,061 --> 02:59:03,160
conversations with people outside of 
podcasting.

4513
02:59:03,190 --> 02:59:04,023
Like you and I got deeper and got to 
know each other better and this 

4514
02:59:06,491 --> 02:59:09,160
conversation then we would,
if we knew each other,

4515
02:59:09,220 --> 02:59:11,380
passing each other with the UFC for a 
decade.

4516
02:59:11,830 --> 02:59:12,940
How has it been?
Three hours?

4517
02:59:13,150 --> 02:59:14,020
Yes.
Holy Shit.

4518
02:59:14,790 --> 02:59:16,710
I had no idea.
That's what we usually do.

4519
02:59:16,780 --> 02:59:19,220
I had no idea it was that long.
Time flies very.

4520
02:59:19,240 --> 02:59:20,670
You always have other guests and you 
know,

4521
02:59:21,300 --> 02:59:22,540
all three hours,
you and I just,

4522
02:59:23,680 --> 02:59:24,250
but,
but,

4523
02:59:24,250 --> 02:59:25,083
but we,
whenever in life do you get to sit 

4524
02:59:27,031 --> 02:59:27,864
across from someone?
Just stare them in the eyes across the 

4525
02:59:29,761 --> 02:59:32,760
table like you and I have done for three
hours and just go deep.

4526
02:59:32,830 --> 02:59:34,240
Well,
and it's a space you've created,

4527
02:59:34,241 --> 02:59:36,440
right?
Like you've built this pit,

4528
02:59:36,470 --> 02:59:39,100
you're big on that word.
Space creating.

4529
02:59:39,101 --> 02:59:40,720
I know writing shit.
I,

4530
02:59:40,721 --> 02:59:41,554
it's so weird.
It's like I was reading all this for 

4531
02:59:42,790 --> 02:59:44,530
Carlton's Heterotopia Steph and I'm just
like,

4532
02:59:44,531 --> 02:59:48,220
this is really cool because I see this 
when we read and I see this,

4533
02:59:48,221 --> 02:59:50,830
I listen to so many audio books and so 
many podcasts and I'm just like,

4534
02:59:51,070 --> 02:59:51,903
I'm finding weird spaces in my brain to 
be connected to people who don't even 

4535
02:59:54,761 --> 02:59:57,460
know who the fuck I am.
But I feel close to them.

4536
02:59:57,580 --> 02:59:58,110
Yeah.
And that's,

4537
02:59:58,110 --> 02:59:58,601
that's,
yeah,

4538
02:59:58,601 --> 03:00:00,280
that's exactly what it is and that 
sounds,

4539
03:00:00,281 --> 03:00:01,114
yeah,
yeah.

4540
03:00:01,270 --> 03:00:02,320
Yeah.
I,

4541
03:00:02,410 --> 03:00:04,720
I,
I should probably stop talking,

4542
03:00:04,721 --> 03:00:07,390
but I forgot.
I totally forgot to plug in.

4543
03:00:07,391 --> 03:00:08,320
Victor.
I was just like,

4544
03:00:08,321 --> 03:00:09,154
cause I was gonna just,
I was going to email all of these 

4545
03:00:10,241 --> 03:00:11,440
questions too.
Anyways,

4546
03:00:11,441 --> 03:00:13,870
I could talk to you,
but I love actually talking to in person

4547
03:00:13,871 --> 03:00:17,170
because I feel like I haven't had the 
opportunity to actually know you and um,

4548
03:00:17,470 --> 03:00:18,610
you know,
except for when I listen to you,

4549
03:00:19,140 --> 03:00:21,130
but that's a different,
yeah,

4550
03:00:21,690 --> 03:00:22,523
yeah.
It's weird,

4551
03:00:23,320 --> 03:00:24,940
but life's weird.
Life is weird.

4552
03:00:25,000 --> 03:00:26,440
Where does fuck it's fucking weird.

4553
03:00:29,230 --> 03:00:30,920
Is it?
Is it,

4554
03:00:30,930 --> 03:00:32,050
is this all about

4555
03:00:32,740 --> 03:00:35,140
good for people to hear that it's weird 
for other people too.

4556
03:00:35,200 --> 03:00:36,033
You know it's good for me to hear that.
It's weird for you and it's good for 

4557
03:00:37,871 --> 03:00:38,704
other people to hear that.
It's weird for me and it's fucking 

4558
03:00:40,661 --> 03:00:41,494
weird.
Yeah,

4559
03:00:42,330 --> 03:00:44,290
but you can be nice.
Yeah,

4560
03:00:44,410 --> 03:00:45,280
you can be nice through this.
Yeah,

4561
03:00:45,440 --> 03:00:48,980
you could be nice and you can actually,
you can connect to people and like if it

4562
03:00:48,981 --> 03:00:49,814
is like the Appalachian trail and we're 
just putting one foot in front of the 

4563
03:00:51,741 --> 03:00:53,170
other,
at least it's damn town.

4564
03:00:53,190 --> 03:00:55,290
Feel people that finish that trail think
that.

4565
03:00:55,400 --> 03:00:57,140
I don't think they do.
I think the people who fail,

4566
03:00:57,490 --> 03:00:59,380
they decide it's just one foot in front.
The other,

4567
03:00:59,381 --> 03:01:00,040
I want to stay at

4568
03:01:00,040 --> 03:01:04,990
the fucking red roof inn tonight.
Thank you very much.

4569
03:01:05,300 --> 03:01:06,970
Really appreciate you coming on here.
It was fun.

4570
03:01:06,971 --> 03:01:08,020
I really,
really enjoyed it.

4571
03:01:08,500 --> 03:01:10,570
All right folks,
we'll be back next week.

4572
03:01:10,571 --> 03:01:11,404
See Ya.
