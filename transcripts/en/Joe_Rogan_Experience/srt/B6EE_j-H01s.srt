you will get 15% off the
number one sex toy for men.

5
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:22,800
It is an excellent alternative
to masturbation. Without it,

6
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:27,990
I recommend it. Brian do recommend it.
I like it a lot. It's awesome right now.

7
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:32,190
It comes in different shapes.
You can get buttholes mouths,

8
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:34,290
you can get whatever are,
whatever you're down for it.

9
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:35,820
Even like vampire mountains.

10
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:40,500
Let's go get some alien mouths
are alien Vaginas, right?

11
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:42,480
I need an Easter bunny flashlight.

12
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:46,220
You know it needs to look like a bunny's
vagina. Cross the line and fellow.

13
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:50,670
Imagine with like art, like real
rabid hair on it. Ooh, oh yeah.

14
00:00:50,671 --> 00:00:53,160
And the or the fake rabbit. We hear
like when you see this rabbit foots,

15
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:54,690
that truck stops that are so creepy.

16
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:56,790
It looks like there's like a hard
bubble gum in the middle of it.

17
00:00:56,791 --> 00:01:01,060
But it was a cop in San
Francisco and he found a, uh,

18
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:03,150
he,
this guy had a sheet,

19
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:08,160
a Chinese guy had the sheet over
his lap and my buddy goes to,

20
00:01:08,161 --> 00:01:09,840
something's going on
with that fucking sheet.

21
00:01:09,841 --> 00:01:12,210
And that guy's parked in a
weird place and that's weird.

22
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:17,410
And he found that the guy was
fucking ate chicken. Oh my God.

23
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:22,560
Chicken. Oh fuck chickens.
Let's start with your mom. Oh,

24
00:01:22,561 --> 00:01:25,710
what went wrong in your childhood
here to fucking in the egg.

25
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,440
Did you fuck it's Po?
Yeah, he's fucking poultry.

26
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:31,480
I guess you that's where you
fuck a chicken. Right? And
his egg whole. I guess so.

27
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:36,110
I never thought of that in the egg hall.
She gross.

28
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:38,620
I never even thought of that.
I didn't even know where,

29
00:01:38,621 --> 00:01:41,340
where he would fuck a chicken.
There's like strong side of it.

30
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,570
That's exactly right.

31
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:46,430
When it is like websites
dedicated to do to fuck chicken,

32
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:50,940
she can hold out to be enough people.
That's about chickens sort of movement.

33
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:54,240
Have you seen Nica Nica Schwartzman's
that had bid on that? He goes man,

34
00:01:54,241 --> 00:01:56,120
before the Internet,
if you've got a fetish it must've sucked.

35
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:59,220
Cause you had to feel people out.
He'd be like dinner and you'd go, Hey,

36
00:01:59,221 --> 00:02:01,440
I'm going to go to the bathroom,
but a or I could just piss on your face.

37
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:06,690
I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding.
I'm just kidding. That's so true.

38
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,550
It's so funny. Mad. I'm like,

39
00:02:08,551 --> 00:02:13,551
you know the story about the documentary
zoo there was based on those guys go

40
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:17,270
want to have sex with animals. There was
two files. He didn't know this weight.

41
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,740
How to, how to buy a zoo or
I don't know. No, no, no.

42
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:24,240
It was just called zoo and it was about
zoophilia if that's the correct way of

43
00:02:24,241 --> 00:02:24,840
pronouncing it.

44
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:28,830
It's people who are attracted to animals
and they would go and they will be in

45
00:02:28,831 --> 00:02:32,310
Washington state. It was legal,
real hot shit up until this movie,

46
00:02:32,311 --> 00:02:36,300
until this documentary came out, this guy
died. He got fucked to death by a horse.

47
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:40,190
Oh my. Then they pretty bright. Yeah.
I've, I've told you about this. I know.

48
00:02:40,191 --> 00:02:43,860
I got a guy, the guy had got brought
him to the hospital. He had bled out.

49
00:02:43,861 --> 00:02:47,400
And then the, the, the people that brought
him in all got arrested and they said,

50
00:02:47,401 --> 00:02:48,390
what the fuck's going on?

51
00:02:48,391 --> 00:02:50,910
And somebody cracked and then
he took them back to the barn.

52
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:56,030
You can't crack in that situation. You've
got to, he'd go, Oh man, he'd been,

53
00:02:56,190 --> 00:03:01,060
he was who he was trying to jump over
this fence post out man for act lines.

54
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,810
You can't tell the truth. You can't say
that you go to jail for fucking a horse.

55
00:03:04,811 --> 00:03:05,800
That's a,
that's weird.

56
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:10,100
You bring a dude to the hospital and
his asshole's bleeding and there's some

57
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,920
kind of sperm all over the place.

58
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:16,720
They didn't clean his ass.
I'm sure you know,

59
00:03:16,721 --> 00:03:19,090
once that thing blasted and chicken whole,

60
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:23,140
the whole thing is just so crazy that
there was hundreds of hours of footage of

61
00:03:23,141 --> 00:03:24,910
this stuff and they found
each other on the Internet.

62
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:27,770
You know what they find with a,
um, a lot of people like that,

63
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,640
they have an inability to feel as
deeply as a lot of other people.

64
00:03:30,641 --> 00:03:33,450
So they do these day that they have
to go extreme. That's what happened.

65
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:38,780
It's a term for it, like a, like a,
like a banality. Like they have a, um,

66
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:40,810
sort of,
there's a pathology where you,

67
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:43,480
you essentially are numb
to most of what goes on.

68
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:46,000
So they found the serial
killer in England.

69
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,910
He was a doctor and he had,

70
00:03:48,911 --> 00:03:51,880
when they found out he was doing all
kinds of terrible things. In fact,

71
00:03:51,881 --> 00:03:55,200
I think he was the guy, they did a, they
based silence of the lambs on the guy,

72
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:57,400
eight people.
And they found it.

73
00:03:57,401 --> 00:04:02,401
He had fucking like 25 pins
in his testicles and a punch.

74
00:04:03,551 --> 00:04:05,290
I had pins in his anus,

75
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:07,810
he was sticking them all the way
upstairs and they were like, you know,

76
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:10,160
when the psychiatrist,
um,

77
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:14,800
found that it was because he couldn't
feel anything and he had to do that just

78
00:04:14,801 --> 00:04:18,220
to feel something.
Like he always walked around numb.

79
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:23,230
And so the only way to get kind
of a rush was to stick. Hey, hey,

80
00:04:23,231 --> 00:04:27,760
he's a doctor, ladies and gentlemen.
Hey Doc, I got a pain in my, uh,

81
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:32,320
in my balls. He was a doctor
in England. She's Christ.

82
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:37,010
You don't need a doctor to get alpha
brain, which we'll do commercials.

83
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:41,140
This is the beauty of the
organic commercial. Anyway,

84
00:04:41,141 --> 00:04:43,990
go to [inaudible] dot net click on the
link for the flashlight and when the code

85
00:04:43,991 --> 00:04:48,730
name Rogan 15% off bitch.
Cause I'm also,

86
00:04:48,731 --> 00:04:53,470
we're brought to you by [inaudible]
dot com that's o n n it makers of Alpha

87
00:04:53,471 --> 00:04:57,420
brain, the, did I ever give you reaction?
Yes. And did you enjoy that shit?

88
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:00,250
I don't really, didn't really feel
a big difference. But then again,

89
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:03,910
I don't know why, you know, I only
took two pills. Does just once.

90
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,560
You didn't try it for a while. Yeah, just
once he didn't feel anything. I mean,

91
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:10,560
you know, it's hard to tell. Hard
to tell. I had a lucid dream Joe,

92
00:05:10,561 --> 00:05:14,410
that somebody broke into my car and
I want to know if I take shrink tech,

93
00:05:14,411 --> 00:05:16,270
what helped my dreams because I,

94
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:19,600
my car got broken into and somebody
took off with my car and I ran outside.

95
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:24,250
I'm like, AH, fuck this. I'm not going
to chase you. Think caused that dream.

96
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:27,490
But then I was lazy. My dream. I didn't
want to chase like a dream car around.

97
00:05:27,491 --> 00:05:30,320
I like, I was like, no, I'm not
motivated enough to chase a dream.

98
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:33,820
I want to come see you when it comes to
the 50, if you examine the statement,

99
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:38,320
the efficiency of your brain so your
brain would work more efficiently and then

100
00:05:38,321 --> 00:05:39,011
otherwise I would,

101
00:05:39,011 --> 00:05:42,670
I would imagine that if I were to put
you in a life and death situation or if I

102
00:05:42,671 --> 00:05:45,070
were to put you in a situation
where that really counted,

103
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:47,800
your brain would work
better or at least on,

104
00:05:47,801 --> 00:05:52,801
on more efficiently or at least more
alertly then then would your brain,

105
00:05:53,171 --> 00:05:55,550
if we were just sitting around and shit,
right.

106
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:58,220
So you should play chess in Iraq.

107
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:01,070
That's exactly right. Well, when
you're playing, you know how they,

108
00:06:01,071 --> 00:06:05,210
those guys playing cards and when, and
they let a bull loose. You ever seen that?

109
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,500
And the guy who, the guy she gets up from
the table, but last rice is the winter,

110
00:06:09,501 --> 00:06:12,890
winter. Jesus Christ. That makes my
dick hurt. Just thinking of that,

111
00:06:12,891 --> 00:06:16,110
that is the craziest shit in the
world. Um, but you know, the,

112
00:06:16,111 --> 00:06:21,111
the reality of consciousness is that we
have ebbs and Lowe's and we have moments

113
00:06:22,761 --> 00:06:25,310
where we can't remember
things and we have,

114
00:06:25,311 --> 00:06:28,840
where the fuck did I put my key moments.
You have your days where you're,

115
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,550
you know, your, whatever your connection,

116
00:06:31,551 --> 00:06:35,390
whatever the full symbiotic connection
of things that's going on to make your

117
00:06:35,391 --> 00:06:38,200
month. That has to do
with hormones too, right?

118
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:42,380
When you have an insulin overload,
apparently that sugar,

119
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:45,110
because sugar can cause too much sugar,

120
00:06:45,111 --> 00:06:47,540
can cause that sort of what
they'd call clouding of the brain.

121
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,630
I never used to believe that sugar is
bad for you until him. As I got older,

122
00:06:50,631 --> 00:06:52,820
I started looking like more,
I love sugar.

123
00:06:52,821 --> 00:06:57,821
I love like delicious chocolate
cake and ship it once in a while.

124
00:06:57,831 --> 00:07:01,130
But if you live in fucking good
for you at all, it's like drinking.

125
00:07:01,131 --> 00:07:03,680
It's like getting hammered.
There's a guy named Robert Lustig

126
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:07,770
and another guy named Scott caught both
doctors and another science writer named

127
00:07:07,771 --> 00:07:12,480
uh, Gary Taub, who a couple
of great books. One is a
good calories, bad calories.

128
00:07:12,481 --> 00:07:14,080
And another book that was
follow up to that book,

129
00:07:14,081 --> 00:07:17,500
which is shorter book called I think
what makes us fat or why we get fat.

130
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:22,390
And through 20 years of
research, you know, and more.
And by the way, Barry Sears,

131
00:07:22,391 --> 00:07:24,310
who was us, uh, I think, uh,

132
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:28,300
doctor over an m a scientist over at
MIT who was one of the pioneers and time

133
00:07:28,301 --> 00:07:31,220
release drugs. And he
also wrote the zone. Well,

134
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:34,420
well if you look at all their research
and these guys are on a clinical level

135
00:07:34,421 --> 00:07:35,050
and they're looking at,

136
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:37,750
they're looking at what happens to your
body that try to measure things like

137
00:07:37,751 --> 00:07:39,580
inflammation in the body,
which is a very difficult to do,

138
00:07:39,581 --> 00:07:41,470
but they're doing all these things.
What they,

139
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:45,190
what they found is that insulin,

140
00:07:45,191 --> 00:07:50,191
which is this mother hormone is directly
related to a lot of health issues.

141
00:07:50,291 --> 00:07:50,621
And,

142
00:07:50,621 --> 00:07:53,560
and so when you look at athletes that
you look at people trying to be healthy,

143
00:07:53,561 --> 00:07:57,700
they, the idea is to eat foods that
keep your insulin somewhat neutral,

144
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:00,700
um,
because that,

145
00:08:00,701 --> 00:08:04,660
that otherwise when you eat
foods that oxidize as sugar,

146
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:09,020
glucose in your system, uh, right
away you run into a host of,

147
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:11,440
you can measure that there
are a host of health problems.

148
00:08:11,441 --> 00:08:15,190
And so a guy like Robert
Lustig just came out with this,

149
00:08:15,191 --> 00:08:19,150
this long hour and a half
speech that he gave somewhere.

150
00:08:19,151 --> 00:08:22,870
And Gary Taubes kind of conferred in
the New York Times saying, he said,

151
00:08:22,871 --> 00:08:25,490
I think sugar is a toxin. I don't
think it's bad for you. I think it's,

152
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:29,170
it's a toxin, which is kind of a radical
thing where you go, well, come on man.

153
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:30,220
You know, so he said, yeah,

154
00:08:30,221 --> 00:08:34,450
so there's so do you give to your
child is doing your child harm.

155
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:38,140
It's not just, doesn't just rot the
kid's teeth, it's doing the child harm.

156
00:08:38,141 --> 00:08:40,600
And here are the,
here are the host of reasons for it.

157
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,240
And if you actually look at the
literature and then more importantly,

158
00:08:43,241 --> 00:08:47,050
if you look at what athletes are doing
and especially Olympic athletes or,

159
00:08:47,051 --> 00:08:51,340
or they are, they stay away from sugar
for the most part, it's a smart move.

160
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:54,250
Should stay away from sugar,
does make your body feel different.

161
00:08:54,251 --> 00:08:56,160
There are natural that your body can use

162
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,580
and sometimes you buy needs to
glycogen, you know? But um, anyway,

163
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:04,560
on a.com and it kind of
where I got my degree.

164
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:09,030
Hey everybody else talking about sugar.
By the way, listen to Brian Calendar.

165
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:15,570
I know it's not good for you. Um,
um, we, we have a Alpha brain,

166
00:09:15,571 --> 00:09:19,570
which is the cognitive enhancing
supplement. And then there's also, um,

167
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:23,700
shroom tech and shroom tech comes in two
forms. It comes in shroom tech sport,

168
00:09:23,701 --> 00:09:27,360
which I don't recommend unless you
like a real serious workout fiend.

169
00:09:27,361 --> 00:09:31,860
Would that have helped me in my dream
though that car and been able to catch

170
00:09:31,861 --> 00:09:32,671
that burglar be,

171
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:35,460
you would have had some extra endurance
in your training if you were on shoom

172
00:09:35,461 --> 00:09:36,030
tract.

173
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:39,480
Imagine if there was some shit they
take that could specifically charge your

174
00:09:39,481 --> 00:09:43,340
dreams in a certain direction.
Brain. You know what,

175
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:45,150
one of the things in Alpha brain did,

176
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:49,710
they believe a is making people have
such vivid dreams is B six apparently

177
00:09:49,711 --> 00:09:53,670
vitamin B six gives you some pretty
fucking vivid dreams and that's an Alpha

178
00:09:53,671 --> 00:09:57,450
brain as well. It should call Alpha
Tech. Make that few having vivid dreams.

179
00:09:57,451 --> 00:10:00,540
Doesn't that mean you're getting rem
sleep, which is the sleep you need?

180
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:03,420
Not necessarily. I mean, yeah,
you'd need rem sleep, but there's,

181
00:10:03,421 --> 00:10:05,370
I believe there's a deeper
cycle than rem sleep.

182
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:08,010
I don't believe Ram is like
the deepest cycles of sleep,

183
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:11,370
but when your dream isn't that,
isn't that when you're having,

184
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:15,990
but that's an rem sleep as
far as they can, you know?

185
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:16,891
I mean,
who knows?

186
00:10:16,891 --> 00:10:20,580
You might dream in the deepest states as
well and they just can't figure it out.

187
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:21,800
Who knows how to,

188
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:25,410
I don't really understand how they can
figure out exactly what the fuck is going

189
00:10:25,411 --> 00:10:28,140
on in your head. I guess it's
electrical signals or something. Yeah,

190
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:31,230
they're getting better and better at
that, but I don't know. It's crazy shit.

191
00:10:31,231 --> 00:10:32,700
When you really stop and think about it,

192
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:36,960
you shut off for eight hours at
night and you just sort of accept it.

193
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:41,430
The juice you just disappeared. And
some people, some people, not many,

194
00:10:41,431 --> 00:10:44,610
but some people can recharge in
four hours versus eight hours,

195
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:47,940
which is really weird. And, and,
and they think maybe that has,

196
00:10:47,941 --> 00:10:51,180
that's correlated to testosterone to
people with higher testosterone sometimes

197
00:10:51,181 --> 00:10:54,530
need less sleep.
The sleep above an hour a night.

198
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:58,680
That I was always saying that Arnold
was always saying that really will lose

199
00:10:58,681 --> 00:11:00,200
sleep a few hours a night.

200
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:05,960
Why would you go just that's
the best thing all the time.

201
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:14,490
Just tell us about that
time to give someone Dick.

202
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:20,610
Anyway, as we say with all of our
products at [inaudible] dot com what else?

203
00:11:20,611 --> 00:11:25,230
Or I'd leave out, oh no mood,
which is the five HTP supplement,

204
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:28,590
five HTP and l Tryptofan
is a bunch of other stuff,

205
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:31,530
things in as well and it
gives you a nice little,

206
00:11:31,531 --> 00:11:35,190
a nice little serotonin boost
and the shroom tech immune is,

207
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:39,120
this is the new one as far as I understand
that the way it works is that this a,

208
00:11:39,121 --> 00:11:43,380
it's a different mushroom
and this mushroom gives your
body the impression that

209
00:11:43,381 --> 00:11:45,990
it's under attack by like a bug,
you know,

210
00:11:45,991 --> 00:11:47,300
like put or cold or something like that.

211
00:11:47,301 --> 00:11:51,210
So [inaudible] system fires up
for an attack that never comes.

212
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:56,140
That's is boosts your immune out.
Yeah, it's called shroom tech immune.

213
00:11:56,141 --> 00:11:58,150
Anyway,
and as I say with all of these things,

214
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:03,220
the ingredients are available on
[inaudible] dot com go to o, n n I t.

215
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,650
And if you think it's because
it costs too much money,

216
00:12:05,651 --> 00:12:07,870
if you have any sort of
a argument about pricing,

217
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:12,130
go buy it in the cheapest form steel,
the ingredient list and make it yourself.

218
00:12:12,131 --> 00:12:14,590
You can do it and you probably will
save money and good luck to you.

219
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,030
I would be the,

220
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:19,990
the most important thing is I don't want
anybody buying anything that doesn't

221
00:12:19,991 --> 00:12:23,530
want to buy anything. If you don't
want to, that's totally cool.

222
00:12:23,531 --> 00:12:27,370
If you buy it and you don't like it,
you get 100% money back.

223
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:30,730
So it's,
it couldn't be any possibly fair.

224
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:33,580
Like you don't even have to return
the product if you don't like it.

225
00:12:33,581 --> 00:12:36,580
If you try any of this stuff and it
doesn't work, just say it doesn't work.

226
00:12:36,581 --> 00:12:38,380
I want my money back.
Boom. It's that simple.

227
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:42,700
I could a bottle and I
can't make it any easier.

228
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:47,740
It's trying to make it as,
as neutral and as honest as possible.

229
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:51,690
I enjoy all the supplements I use
them, they're awesome. And uh,

230
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:52,930
go to Joe rogan.net.

231
00:12:52,931 --> 00:12:55,450

235
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:17,280
[inaudible]

236
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:22,870
what does that weird
effect that you always do?

237
00:13:22,871 --> 00:13:26,380
At the end of that we make it all
wonky and I know, why do you do that?

238
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:31,130
I'm taking drum lessons and I was
trying to play that riff dues.

239
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:36,610
They would play drums at like at a
diner and be like serious about it.

240
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:39,950
How about the guy that would
bring his drumsticks, places
for greatness, you know,

241
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:42,890
stick them in his back pocket
with a Bandana. Events.

242
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:45,750
Just play with this drunk
driving and my, my, my blood,

243
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:48,880
well Brody would do it but on stage
Brody's a really good drummer. Yes.

244
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:55,660
Part of his act Brody would get up on
stage and have chairs to put chairs up

245
00:13:55,891 --> 00:13:58,560
there and do like a fucking drum show.
And the band,

246
00:13:58,590 --> 00:14:03,210
I mean you know that I'm an honorary
member of dawn Buress is uh, air band.

247
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:07,380
Well I didn't know that there was a whole
dawn barrows air band called the Paris

248
00:14:07,381 --> 00:14:10,710
Kennedy overdrive. First of
all. Second of all, I play,

249
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:14,160
I play 32 different air instruments,
one of which is the baby.

250
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:17,370
I take a baby out and I blow on its
stomach and then I throw it into the

251
00:14:17,371 --> 00:14:21,090
audience. That's one of the things I
do. I play the harp, I play the cello,

252
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:24,600
I play the violin and I play the,
um,

253
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:30,190
I played the 13 year old Filipino boy and
that's when I saw him and he was quiet.

254
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:34,770
Now he's 17. 13 is a, that's not right.
It's 17 which is legal in some states.

255
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:39,330
And uh, and I, I mocks automize a 17
year old Filipino boy as he screams,

256
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:43,260
that's part of the music. So we, they
all play drums. Like the fuck is this.

257
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:47,590
Oh Dude, you don't look at two o'clock in
comedy store. I'm one what? Dawn Burris.

258
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:50,010
She is, he's the last guy to
perform every single time.

259
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:55,220
And he has the bears overdrive and they
play music and he has an air band up

260
00:14:55,221 --> 00:14:56,660
there.
He lip syncs,

261
00:14:57,410 --> 00:15:01,190
Brody plays the drums and then
he's got various guitarist.

262
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:04,160
And then I,

263
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:08,240
when I'm there I get up and I'm a guest
performer and I start with the guitar

264
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:11,750
and I'm also a guest singer.
And then we play like five,

265
00:15:11,751 --> 00:15:15,560
six songs and it's all air instruments,
but I have my own air instruments.

266
00:15:15,561 --> 00:15:19,070
I choose, I play humans and
I play fucking, you know,

267
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:23,860
things that most people don't. You have a
job. Yes I do. Yes I do. How am I growth?

268
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:25,520
Really happy. When I come home at
three in the morning, she's like,

269
00:15:25,521 --> 00:15:29,420
what the fuck you doing? I'm
like, the Ben was playing late.

270
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:34,820
Like you're in your forties fucking loser.
Get away from me.

271
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:39,110
I always watching that, just watching
it. I'll go there and be like,

272
00:15:39,111 --> 00:15:42,400
why am I here at 2:00 AM watching
an airbag always like seven,

273
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:46,920
seven alcoholics and my fork comics
and we play like we're playing it

274
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:51,440
entertaining for me. For me, it's
really fun to watch. It's one.

275
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:54,530
Don Berries is so hilarious. I'm going
to get them to do it at the death squads.

276
00:15:54,531 --> 00:15:56,390
John Behr is one of the
funniest people in the world.

277
00:15:56,400 --> 00:16:00,050
Nobody knows that dude killed.
He's a great personality. Great.

278
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:02,060
I always enjoyed hanging out with Tom.
We do it.

279
00:16:02,061 --> 00:16:06,340
We do a sketch every single time we
see each other every single time. Yeah.

280
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:08,640
He's one of those guys.
Every time I start something up,

281
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:12,980
he'll be talking as all these people
and I go by and I go, Hey, I had done,

282
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,470
I don't want to embarrass you in front
of everybody, but I need my money.

283
00:16:15,471 --> 00:16:19,550
I need my money. I didn't go,
why? I go, Oh man, I'm sorry,

284
00:16:19,551 --> 00:16:22,250
but it's been a month now I need, I really
need to see my money. Let me 10 grand.

285
00:16:22,251 --> 00:16:24,710
He goes, you're embarrassing me in
front. All my friends like this, look,

286
00:16:24,711 --> 00:16:26,540
I don't want any trouble.
They get the fuck over here.

287
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:27,740
And he slaps him and I and he's,

288
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:32,250
and then he mocked mouth rapes me and
then I begged him as to what I'm doing.

289
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:35,980
Oh my mouth.
Shut the fuck up.

290
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:44,890
No. Are you, are you, how close
are you getting Mouthy Dick?

291
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:46,400
Right up against his dick.

292
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:52,760
Oh my God,
your mouth is on his day.

293
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:55,840
Thompson,
my,

294
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:59,820
he mocked dumps in my mom and he pushes
me away and I lie there in the fetal

295
00:16:59,821 --> 00:17:02,760
position and everybody around us doesn't
know what the fuck just happened.

296
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:05,640
And he just kind of quick pretends
to zip his pants up and he goes,

297
00:17:05,641 --> 00:17:10,530
sorry about that. Goes back to his car
a little hard. Uh, not that I know of,

298
00:17:10,531 --> 00:17:14,610
but then it's all a blur for me. So what
did I just commit to the skin manage?

299
00:17:14,611 --> 00:17:18,700
Have you did how many times you've done
it? Sketch? No more than 50. 60 Times.

300
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:24,360
I like to limit myself every single time.
Every time you see him.

301
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:27,890
So every time we see him you've run
up to him and shoved your mouth on it.

302
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,070
Every time I see him I go,

303
00:17:29,071 --> 00:17:31,840
I just asked for my fucking money
that he owes me and my 10 grand.

304
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:35,140
There's different results. Oh, I see.

305
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:39,300
Then then first he'll either beat me up
and then fuck my mouth and then I begged

306
00:17:39,301 --> 00:17:43,110
him not to drop a nut it and you know,

307
00:17:43,111 --> 00:17:45,960
he's so committed and it
looks so real and people,

308
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:49,920
he actually thinks something like that
is going on is I'm begging home times.

309
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:53,190
Has Your mouth touched his dick?
Dude? No more than, I mean,

310
00:17:53,191 --> 00:17:57,270
this is a stupid question. I look, I'm a
straight man. Maybe 30 times, 40 times.

311
00:17:57,271 --> 00:18:00,930
I don't know what the fuck. Why am
being grilled? Why do I have to be,

312
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:06,230
you've got to get video on it cause people
think we're serious because I grew up,

313
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:09,580
I, I go, I act like I'm a
little afraid of Meridian. Don,

314
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:12,130
I don't want to bother you, but you know,
I need my $10,000. It's been a month.

315
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:16,070
He goes here. Okay. What'd you say? I go,

316
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:18,240
I ain't more money cause you're gonna
embarrass me if I front all my friends

317
00:18:18,241 --> 00:18:19,830
like this, I go, no, I'm not trying
to embarrass you. I just need,

318
00:18:19,831 --> 00:18:21,410
I really need the money.
I'm having trouble paying my rent.

319
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:24,000
I go ahead and he goes, yeah. Did
he say, you get the fuck Outta here.

320
00:18:24,001 --> 00:18:26,880
And he pushes me away and then I
come back and ask them a second time.

321
00:18:26,881 --> 00:18:29,520
Sometimes we'll do it that way.
And then he's just fucking had it.

322
00:18:29,521 --> 00:18:33,780
And he just slaps me to my
knees and mouth rate today. Hi.

323
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:36,050
I'm a grown man, ladies and
gentlemen. That's right.

324
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:39,860
What the fuck man call you comedy.

325
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:43,430
How did I not know this about you though?
Dude, he's so much fun to do bits with.

326
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:46,880
How long it was this all comedy
store stuff. Oh, comedy store shit.

327
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:50,240
When did you start doing this? How
many years ago? Like four. Yeah.

328
00:18:50,241 --> 00:18:52,190
That's when I stopped going there.
This is all,

329
00:18:52,191 --> 00:18:55,790
this is post post me at the comedy store.
That's all.

330
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:59,210
That's all we ever did there. Have you
ever had a man's finger in your asshole?

331
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:01,200
Uh, that's, no, I haven't.

332
00:19:01,201 --> 00:19:04,170
I have had a man's thumb in my asshole
and I think I told that story last time I

333
00:19:04,171 --> 00:19:06,420
was on the on. Yeah. You
don't remember? Yeah,

334
00:19:06,421 --> 00:19:11,130
I thought that I was just remembering
stories he told that story. Yeah. I mean,

335
00:19:11,131 --> 00:19:15,510
not with a tranny. And see reading this
off Twitter? No, no I'm not. I'm looking.

336
00:19:15,511 --> 00:19:18,240
Look, when I'm looking at, I'm
just spaced out. I was like, wait,

337
00:19:18,241 --> 00:19:19,840
was he the one that,
yes,

338
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:23,490
there was a bunch of
other stories as well.

339
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:29,820
So every time you come here you met
Geisha.

340
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:36,050
By the way, forget all the gay stuff.
Um, are you fully aware of where,

341
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:40,290
what's that were simply guys,
listen guys,

342
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:45,300
nobody cares about that
person. I don't want to say 30,

343
00:19:45,301 --> 00:19:48,750
40, whatever. You guys
are a bunch of pure,

344
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:50,760
I'm offering up this information.

345
00:19:50,761 --> 00:19:55,710
So I'm trying to hide this dog 40
carts and now you're whatever, uh,

346
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,210
you, you are aware, I hope we're aware of,

347
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:01,190
I don't know if you watched the nat geo
thing called a great white invasion,

348
00:20:01,191 --> 00:20:04,700
I believe it's called.
You know that the Santa Monica Pier,

349
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:08,690
the Santa Monica pier has a,
a large concentration,

350
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:13,460
a great whites swimming between
the pylons. You wear that? Oh No.

351
00:20:13,461 --> 00:20:16,410
That good way to get us
off the gay subject. Yeah,

352
00:20:16,411 --> 00:20:19,660
give us the two favorite topics.

353
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,920
Actually got missiles
pointed right at him, Bro.

354
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:26,460
Dude is getting tricked into blowing guys.

355
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:30,420
And cray most they can kill you.
That's me all day.

356
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:34,030
So how many are we talking? Think
about how many sharks? Well,

357
00:20:34,031 --> 00:20:37,570
at one point they were tagging them and
what they found was they would follow

358
00:20:37,571 --> 00:20:41,770
them after they would tag them and they
were all coming into four and five foot

359
00:20:41,771 --> 00:20:46,090
deep water at the Santa Monica Pier.
Crazy and all around.

360
00:20:46,091 --> 00:20:50,050
There were some of the largest of
great wise at any given time. Can Be.

361
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:55,030
How about that now? Now
largest concentration of
great whites. Trust watching,

362
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:58,690
not tambien the great white invasion.
Okay.

363
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,860
They don't know why they're coming
so close to the shore, but they,

364
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:04,450
Bashar Shark ecologists
think that's a good sign.

365
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,780
But bottom line is they thought
or houses or homeless Pete, Dude,

366
00:21:07,781 --> 00:21:10,660
they stock seals here. Well here's
what's fucking incredible. Okay.

367
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:14,840
And there are great ones and if you take
a helicopter ride over Malabo there's,

368
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:16,330
you can youtube it right now.

369
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:19,150
Just go great white Malibu
and you'll see a helicopter.

370
00:21:19,151 --> 00:21:22,360
It was shooting out website thing and
there was like an 18 foot or just swimming

371
00:21:22,361 --> 00:21:24,370
around just about, you know, I don't know,

372
00:21:24,371 --> 00:21:28,510
a quarter mile less than it was probably
an eighth of a mile off shore, you know,

373
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:30,310
let's call it 300 yards off shore.

374
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:33,670
That shit happens all day and by the way,

375
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:37,780
they are eating seals all the time.
Surfers are always in the water.

376
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:41,510
They know you're in the water and they
don't fucking buy you because it's gotta

377
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:44,890
be the perfect storm. Oh Jesus.
What the fuck ever. Whatever.

378
00:21:44,891 --> 00:21:47,110
It's to be the perfect.
Exactly. It's called.

379
00:21:47,111 --> 00:21:49,790
It's called like an 18 foot
fish that will bite you.

380
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:54,250
It takes a hundred pound bites. Freak me
out. I go into the water up to my ankle.

381
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:55,680
That's what I do.
My feet stay white.

382
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:59,960
My buddy's bronze in Hawaii last summer
and I freaked out a little bit while I

383
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:03,230
was in there. I was snorkeling and I
was like, what am I doing? I'm going to,

384
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:07,600
I'm going to be one of my own jokes when
we get eaten by something. I was down,

385
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:11,620
I was down in West Palm Beach and I was
staying at this place called the Onfi,

386
00:22:11,621 --> 00:22:16,600
this great, great, really great resort.
And I asked, I asked one of the guys,

387
00:22:16,601 --> 00:22:21,520
he was parasailing and I go and I go,
any sharks out there? And he goes,

388
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:24,790
Oh yeah dude. Oh yeah.
Oh No, they're times,

389
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:27,340
certain times of the year they
put flags up, purple flags.

390
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:30,790
You can't swim because the bull sharks,
they're all migrating this way.

391
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:34,060
And then you've got the
spinners and they'll bite your
hand and feet. I was like,

392
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:37,420
why are you talking about said,
Oh yeah, did they you do there?

393
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:39,610
They're all over the place.
They're there. Co He goes,

394
00:22:39,611 --> 00:22:41,440
I don't know why people swim
in this water. They're crazy.

395
00:22:41,441 --> 00:22:43,750
Cause I'm always kite surfing
and I stay on my kite.

396
00:22:43,751 --> 00:22:47,470
Surf Dude may well go check out how many
shark attacks that have been in palm

397
00:22:47,471 --> 00:22:49,210
beach. The fact that there,
but there was one summer,

398
00:22:49,211 --> 00:22:51,040
they were like eight shark attacks.
Yeah,

399
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:55,300
like a fight in your leg off bull sharks
will, the bull sharks are so crazy.

400
00:22:55,301 --> 00:22:58,710
They'll go way, way in shore. They'll go
into fresh water. That's exactly right.

401
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,070
200 miles,

402
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:05,160
200 miles up the Mississippi near
Illinois in freshwater sharks,

403
00:23:06,191 --> 00:23:07,024
man.
Well,

404
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:11,980
you know the story that inspired
jaws that was based on a river,

405
00:23:11,981 --> 00:23:16,300
a test in New Jersey that was based
on one summer where these bull sharks,

406
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:19,370
where Jack and people in a river,
it wasn't a great wife,

407
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:23,490
great wife for Hollywood. You know, when
Peter Benchley it turns it into a yeah,

408
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,450
post sharp. Pretty sure that's
what he was a spicy. It was,

409
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:29,180
I remember it was like this aberration
where they were being, you know, they,

410
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:31,960
they will, they'll go, they've
found them way far up river man.

411
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:36,190
There was one of those, um, monster
quest shows. They had freshwater sharks.

412
00:23:36,191 --> 00:23:38,710
One of them was the reality of it.
That was a fun fucking show.

413
00:23:38,711 --> 00:23:43,610
Even though they never found any
monsters. [inaudible] never had.

414
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:47,060
They actually even Paranas piranhas
don't eat you. I always thought,

415
00:23:47,061 --> 00:23:50,420
what if you jumped in? Water is honesty.
You, you got to Eaton. If you're living,

416
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:52,700
they swim away from you.
They don't eat you.

417
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:56,090
The only time a Pronto we'll actually
use when they're starving in little mud

418
00:23:56,091 --> 00:23:58,430
pools and you put your hand in
there and they haven't eaten.

419
00:23:58,431 --> 00:24:00,860
They beat and everything else there and
they're starving. They'll bite your hand.

420
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:04,540
Otherwise Sick Ville each other.
Actually they,

421
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:07,730
they even put a duck in there with
a live talk with a bunch of uh,

422
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:11,990
Paranas Protestant swam away. No, I
used to have Pronto's. Yeah. Yeah.

423
00:24:11,991 --> 00:24:13,520
Don't listen to that nonsense.

424
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:17,440
I remember that it was
called that you had the,

425
00:24:17,530 --> 00:24:20,520
you had the gold fish on the other side.
They called it death row.

426
00:24:20,521 --> 00:24:21,920
It's death row at two tanks.

427
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:25,580
I had a tank filler Paranas and
then a tank filled with goldfish.

428
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,810
Goldfish would just swim looking
at their, their, you know,

429
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:34,280
what they were going to be. Yeah. Their
future. They would fuck those goldfish up.

430
00:24:34,281 --> 00:24:37,670
It was wild to see man fish,
I guess really wild to say.

431
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:41,000
They don't just eat fish bro. Delete
anything. There's videos of them.

432
00:24:41,001 --> 00:24:42,890
I never fed them anything
other than goldfish.

433
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:45,650
And that's just what their natural,
it was natural for them to eat fish.

434
00:24:45,651 --> 00:24:49,180
But I got tired of it. It's
too creepy. I mean it's like,

435
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:52,610
it is a part of the food
chain and everything and it's
life and it's natural and

436
00:24:52,611 --> 00:24:55,480
it's just the way it works
out in the wild. I mean,

437
00:24:55,490 --> 00:24:57,830
animals eat animals and
that's just the way it goes.

438
00:24:58,070 --> 00:25:01,850
But there's something about just washing
this slaughter every couple of days in

439
00:25:01,851 --> 00:25:05,660
my house,
fucking morose man,

440
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:09,460
a Burmese python and I used to have a
feed at rats and really you have to stand

441
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:13,190
the rats. You take them by the tail and
you throw them against the wall. Oh Dude.

442
00:25:13,191 --> 00:25:16,090
It's felt bad after awhile. I was like,
I've got to kill this greatness. You know,

443
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:19,040
rats are kind of cool cause
you can't just let it in there.

444
00:25:19,041 --> 00:25:21,710
There was a rattle fight back. Right.
And it's nice to snake its bit.

445
00:25:21,711 --> 00:25:24,830
But here's the other thing. Here's the
other thing. Snakes are fucking boring.

446
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:28,640
Okay. I like that. It just
sit there and they, I guess
they slither, they're creepy.

447
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:31,460
I'd rather have a rat and
pythons are fucking mean.

448
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:34,460
My mind got to be eight feet
long and the thing was like,

449
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,560
he would try to fight you every time you
stick your hand in there. I was like,

450
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:40,430
keep this fucking thing. Those are
creeps. Those are monsters, man.

451
00:25:40,431 --> 00:25:42,290
They're monsters.
They get used to you touching them.

452
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:45,710
They don't give a fuck about a reptile.
Yeah. They never give a fuck about you.

453
00:25:45,711 --> 00:25:48,590
I don't give a fuck about. Yeah. People
are weird man with their connections.

454
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:50,190
Reptiles, you know that. How about that?

455
00:25:50,191 --> 00:25:54,210
That guy who had swims where he's got a
Costa Rican crocodile 17 feet long and

456
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:56,840
and raised from a baby and swims with it.
Seeing that crazy,

457
00:25:57,150 --> 00:25:59,980
crazy shit in the world I've ever
seen. It's nuts. It's close to,

458
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:04,790
we can crocodile 17 feet and
he's a salt water crocodiles it.

459
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:06,950
Those are the big ones.
Those are the brackish water.

460
00:26:06,951 --> 00:26:10,490
They will be with each of us
fucking crying. No, I don't
believe you can do that.

461
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:14,330
Costa Rican crocodiles and I've,
I've done the research. They are,

462
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:18,290
they are way more timid than most
crocodiles and Nile crocodile.

463
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:21,900
You couldn't do it with,
there's no fucking way because they will.

464
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:26,020
You are as tasty to a Nile
crocodile as any food source.

465
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:30,080
They have Costa Rica. So beautiful.
Even the CROC crocs are chill.

466
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:34,490
That's hilarious. Exactly what it
is. That's not actually a little shy.

467
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:36,680
They're shy crocodiles.

468
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:42,200
Whereas good luck with a fucking Nile.
Krakatau good luck raising that thing.

469
00:26:42,201 --> 00:26:45,120
It's amazing that there's animals
like that that essentially served.

470
00:26:45,121 --> 00:26:49,560
I mean they must have survived that
big asteroid impact that killed the

471
00:26:49,561 --> 00:26:52,920
dinosaurs. Yeah, the Yucatan one.
Yeah. It must've. Then they had to,

472
00:26:52,921 --> 00:26:56,870
if they are dinosaurs, they're old. Isn't
that right? I don't think like here,

473
00:26:56,910 --> 00:27:00,000
like virtually unchanged for like more
than a hundred years when they found that

474
00:27:00,001 --> 00:27:04,020
they found this one skeleton of this
huge crocodile where the skull itself was

475
00:27:04,021 --> 00:27:07,320
six feet long and yeah, I heard
about that one. It was basically,

476
00:27:07,321 --> 00:27:09,900
if you look at the anatomy of
the, of the animal, it was a,

477
00:27:09,901 --> 00:27:14,730
it was no different than a real crocodile.
It was just a giant one. Back then.

478
00:27:14,731 --> 00:27:19,530
Animals were huge. Yeah.
An ambush. Predator w well,
look at this. You all just,

479
00:27:19,650 --> 00:27:22,410
I just did a radio show and then
sue just was on the show in a,

480
00:27:22,411 --> 00:27:24,060
in a fucking Fort Lauderdale.
Right.

481
00:27:24,330 --> 00:27:29,280
And the guy's been to Africa 35 times
documentary filmmaker. And he said,

482
00:27:29,281 --> 00:27:30,150
uh, he goes, dude,

483
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:35,180
I was in Rwanda and I watched a
giraffe drinking and a croc come out,

484
00:27:35,311 --> 00:27:39,180
grab batch raft by the head,
pull it into the fucking water,

485
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,090
drown it and twist its head off.

486
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:45,090
And then it's friends came in and
ate the rest of that fucking giraffe.

487
00:27:45,091 --> 00:27:49,230
So nobody's safe. And by the
way, you know what I'm saying?

488
00:27:49,231 --> 00:27:52,470
Safe baby elephants.
When they stick their toe in the water,

489
00:27:52,471 --> 00:27:54,970
they grabbed that date, grab
that. I mean their, their Trump,

490
00:27:54,971 --> 00:27:58,590
they'll grab that trunk and drown
it. Okay. They'll eat elephants.

491
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:02,290
Whatever's in the fucking
water. So Jesus, oh by the way,

492
00:28:02,291 --> 00:28:06,180
that I mentioned that the ones in
Tanzania weigh in at over 2000 pounds.

493
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:11,790
I got a, there's a video that, it's a
one of those iconic ones where w one,

494
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:16,470
a crocodile jumps out of this waterhole
and grabs. It was a big animal.

495
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:18,480
I think it was a water buffalo were up,

496
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:21,900
but will the beast probably a be
350 pound a little bit. He's like,

497
00:28:21,901 --> 00:28:26,720
when I'm around the fucking midsection
and whip this thing around like it was a

498
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:29,450
children's toy. You Go, you
get, you get caught, you,

499
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:32,370
you're brought them to the water.
That's it. It and it happens in a flash.

500
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:38,540
Here's a piece of the world is going on
in the same time as us that's going on

501
00:28:39,511 --> 00:28:42,330
right now. I mean, we're
just not there. That's right.

502
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:45,600
There's a spot where if you step
in the water in the wrong spot,

503
00:28:45,601 --> 00:28:50,340
I'll monster that lived to a hundred
million years ago. There's going to eat.

504
00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:53,000
As I get older, they're all, like I said,

505
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:57,720
is it's different realities of how some
people live your fucking worst nightmare

506
00:28:57,721 --> 00:29:02,370
and somehow I'm lucky I
never lose perspective and
that shit. Look at history,

507
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:05,400
look at history. You know the fact
that we live in that side of it,

508
00:29:05,401 --> 00:29:08,160
I don't have to worry about,
I'm Mongol hoard coming over that hill.

509
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:09,630
Everybody I know.

510
00:29:10,010 --> 00:29:14,430
Yeah. Blown this. Obama was in office.
I'll tell you what, you got to suck.

511
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:20,150
Failed, so pussified way ain't
got nobody to have guns no more.

512
00:29:20,290 --> 00:29:24,330
They're got to make it hard to have
guns. Then they're going to take over. Or

513
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:27,590
by the way, did you hear about
this and I'm sorry, go ahead.

514
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:31,050
I was going to ask you if you know
how big a blue whales tongue is.

515
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:35,420
It's fucking huge. It's the size of
an elephant. God Damn. What about Tom?

516
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:38,670
His heart's the size of a car.
His Dick is gigantic.

517
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:42,010
I wonder how big his tickets
pictures are enormous.

518
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:46,100
It's pictures of the voice and the will
live there 95 feet long and they weigh

519
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:51,160
200 tons, I believe too can
wait for the documentary.

520
00:29:51,161 --> 00:29:56,050
The guy that fucks Wilcock. Wait, well
we guys from it. What were you saying?

521
00:29:56,051 --> 00:29:58,000
What were you going to ask me? I
don't remember now. I said, well,

522
00:29:58,001 --> 00:30:01,300
you're going to tell
me. Oh, the Obama thing,

523
00:30:01,301 --> 00:30:05,030
the NDA that just passed,
they just signed it on New Year's Eve.

524
00:30:05,031 --> 00:30:08,350
He sand signed it.
That was the bill that makes a,

525
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:13,360
essentially it makes America a
battleground officially classifies it as a

526
00:30:13,421 --> 00:30:18,210
battleground so the military can
come in and stop civil unrest and uh,

527
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:23,250
they can detain people and definitely
they don't have to have warrants anymore.

528
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:25,420
That kind of thing won't
get through the Senate.

529
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:29,610
You've got through Obama just signed.
We got there.

530
00:30:29,611 --> 00:30:32,380
It's done. Touchdown. Terrifying.

531
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:37,330
It's terrifying. First of all, the,
the use of military is, you know,

532
00:30:37,331 --> 00:30:40,030
it's supposed to be strictly
for Hipaa did this and we don't,

533
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:44,110
we don't want to ever consider that our,
our, our people are the enemy. That's deal

534
00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:48,770
don't difference between the FBI and
the CIA. FBI deals with domestic issues.

535
00:30:48,771 --> 00:30:51,740
The CIA supposed to deal with
foreign issues and by the way,

536
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:54,860
you're never allowed to spy on
your own citizens. There is a very,

537
00:30:54,861 --> 00:30:56,600
very specific reason for that.

538
00:30:56,601 --> 00:31:01,220
Very strong separation between
a foreign power service,

539
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,890
a foreign service and a domestic sir.

540
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:04,291
Yeah.

541
00:31:04,291 --> 00:31:07,590
When you get to the point where you're
just all automatically opening up to the

542
00:31:07,591 --> 00:31:09,720
idea that you can't trust anybody,

543
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:14,660
that everybody must be able to be
scanned and stopped and searched and,

544
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:16,810
well,
we were talking before the podcast.

545
00:31:16,811 --> 00:31:21,670
I have a book that I'm reading now
and I've read some of his other books.

546
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:25,750
Leon Uris is considered one of
the great writers, Leon Uris.

547
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:29,290
What's the guy's suppose you r
I s and Leon Uris wrote, right?

548
00:31:29,291 --> 00:31:31,870
Writes historical novels. And if you
ever want to learn history, you know,

549
00:31:31,871 --> 00:31:34,030
whenever you say to somebody,
we should learn the history of Ireland.

550
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:37,180
The problem with that is that how do
you, you know, I, a lot of young people,

551
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:40,450
I get like text after I do these
things or tweets and they say, Hey,

552
00:31:40,451 --> 00:31:41,890
can you give me a
reading list or whatever.

553
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:46,120
And the problem with educating yourself
today is it's very hard to know what to

554
00:31:46,121 --> 00:31:49,480
read. It's also very hard if I say, well,
you should educate yourself on history.

555
00:31:49,481 --> 00:31:52,090
What does that mean? Do I pick up
a book on history? I mean, Jesus,

556
00:31:52,091 --> 00:31:55,840
who wants to sit slog through that?
No. If you want to learn about history,

557
00:31:55,841 --> 00:31:57,310
you want to learn about the
history of the Middle East.

558
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,660
You want to learn the history of Ireland.

559
00:31:58,661 --> 00:32:00,880
Do you want to learn history of the
founding of the state of Israel,

560
00:32:00,881 --> 00:32:04,600
which I'm reading now, a
book called exodus a. If you
want to learn about Ireland,

561
00:32:04,601 --> 00:32:06,940
read a book called Trinity.
If you want to learn about the Arab world,

562
00:32:06,941 --> 00:32:10,400
the Middle East, read the Hodge.
Uh, Leon Uris is a, is a guy who,

563
00:32:10,401 --> 00:32:12,910
who was a foreign correspondent,
who,

564
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:17,860
who spent a great deal of time all over
the world and happens to be a fucking

565
00:32:17,861 --> 00:32:19,300
brilliant writer.

566
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:23,290
He wrote most of his books in the 70s
and the 80s I think even the 60s but he's

567
00:32:23,291 --> 00:32:28,120
considered a great writer. And, and
the point I'm making is that when you,

568
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:33,130
when you talk about how a society and
its laws and its government can sneak up

569
00:32:33,131 --> 00:32:35,440
on you,
if you read exodus about the,

570
00:32:35,441 --> 00:32:39,190
about what happened to the Jews
in Poland and in, and in Germany,

571
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:43,310
you're talking about a group of people
who lived there for 700 years and many of

572
00:32:43,311 --> 00:32:48,260
them were very well established in all
fields, whether it was science, academia,

573
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:51,260
um, uh, the arts and things like that.

574
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:56,770
So when all this antisemitic behavior
started occurring under Hitler's regime,

575
00:32:56,871 --> 00:33:00,860
and it started really in my 33
where stores are being broken in,

576
00:33:00,930 --> 00:33:04,700
articles are being read about blaming
the Jews for everything. Uh, uh,

577
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:07,700
people were being dragged out in
the street and beaten up. If you,

578
00:33:07,701 --> 00:33:11,840
if the majority of the Jewish people
who were established in those societies

579
00:33:11,841 --> 00:33:16,070
were like, look, my, my, I go
back generations. I'm a German,

580
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:20,330
I'm as much a Jew as I am a
German I, and by the way, I am,

581
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:24,440
I've written several books and I, I,
I'm, I, my roots are in this society.

582
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:28,370
If you ever told any of them that well,

583
00:33:28,371 --> 00:33:32,150
your government's going to come
round up. All of you, all of you.

584
00:33:32,151 --> 00:33:34,700
I'm going to give you some numbers
in a second and they're going to kill

585
00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:36,500
everybody, you know, and worse,

586
00:33:36,530 --> 00:33:40,430
they're going to gas torture and starve
them all in a systematic way in the

587
00:33:40,431 --> 00:33:43,640
concentration camps.
That was a troop apocalypse.

588
00:33:43,641 --> 00:33:47,270
And if you don't know anything
about the Holocaust or, or,
or, uh, the World War II,

589
00:33:47,570 --> 00:33:51,410
then you're remiss because it's, it's,
it's the worst event in recorded history.

590
00:33:51,411 --> 00:33:55,580
But it's also very important to us to
study because you don't understand and you

591
00:33:55,581 --> 00:33:59,960
can't fathom the, the depth of
human evil until you see that.

592
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:04,210
Because here's what it was. It wasn't
mad men. It was very rational, cold,

593
00:34:04,211 --> 00:34:09,211
cool minded men with shaved cheeks who
sat in a room dressed in metals and in

594
00:34:10,851 --> 00:34:14,060
suits who came up with something
called the final solution,

595
00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:18,320
which was to kill every single Jew
in the world. And they almost did it.

596
00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:20,150
And in Poland alone,

597
00:34:20,450 --> 00:34:24,980
out of 3.1 million Jews who had been
there for 700 years, mostly in ghettos,

598
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:29,480
but who had deep roots
and huge contributions to
society so that society and

599
00:34:29,481 --> 00:34:33,110
Germany at the end of World War II,
and this is just five, six years,

600
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:38,540
there were 50,000 left, all of whom were
wretches, all of whom were starving,

601
00:34:38,541 --> 00:34:42,560
all of whom were coming out of the
concentration camps like Birkenau,

602
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:46,910
Auschwitz, a Triblinka and all
these things. So when you, if you,

603
00:34:46,970 --> 00:34:51,970
if you really think that you're safe or
if you really think that anybody giving

604
00:34:52,401 --> 00:34:57,050
anybody power over you is a good
idea, is a good idea, you're,

605
00:34:57,051 --> 00:34:58,850
you're,
you're fucking wrong.

606
00:34:58,851 --> 00:35:02,690
And you should pick up a history book
and what makes this country very,

607
00:35:02,691 --> 00:35:05,970
very special and what makes this country
and what you have to fight for his

608
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:10,700
government, by the people, for the
people. And that's very easy to forget.

609
00:35:10,850 --> 00:35:12,620
And even George Washington said,

610
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:16,700
you gotta be careful because people
will invent laws to take their own power

611
00:35:16,701 --> 00:35:20,300
away from that. That's what George
Washington said and it is very human.

612
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:23,540
And if you, if you look at like
if you look at anybody in power,

613
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:27,870
I don't care if it's Republican
or Democrat, uh, you, you did.

614
00:35:27,930 --> 00:35:29,630
This is why I'm a Ron Paul supporter.

615
00:35:29,631 --> 00:35:33,800
Because if you look at anybody in
power that when you're in power, you,

616
00:35:33,801 --> 00:35:35,900
you have an impulse to
try to solve a problem.

617
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:39,750
You want to solve a and the only
way to do that government does what?

618
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:43,650
It passes laws and it grows and it,
and attacks.

619
00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:47,130
Those are too taxing and passing
laws are too coercive measures.

620
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:50,520
That's what they do. It's just,
and you do need some laws.

621
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,920
You do need some taxation,
let's be honest.

622
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:55,650
But when you have a central
authority like that,

623
00:35:55,651 --> 00:36:00,090
the big question for anyone is who is
going to govern the governor, governor,

624
00:36:00,210 --> 00:36:04,260
who is watching the governor? That's the
central question of political science.

625
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:09,420
Who is going to govern it
to and have someone who'd be
on? And the answer is who?

626
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:11,010
The people,
that's the answer.

627
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:15,150
And it just choking
dead out a daily basis.

628
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:18,150
Choking that out slowly.
This is the biggest enemy.

629
00:36:18,151 --> 00:36:20,790
And you have to be on guard at
that all the time. And by the way,

630
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:25,620
it always is under good auspices.
It's always any society, oh my God.

631
00:36:25,621 --> 00:36:27,960
Even the Nazis,
for God's sake,

632
00:36:28,050 --> 00:36:33,050
even the Nazis that monstrous machine
defined what they were doing along what

633
00:36:33,721 --> 00:36:38,460
they would consider moral grounds. Hitler
was trying to quote unquote solve up,

634
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:41,810
solve the Jewish problem, et cetera. And,

635
00:36:41,811 --> 00:36:45,950
and it's a propaganda that
got that, that had lift, uh,

636
00:36:45,951 --> 00:36:47,600
Ukrainians and pull,

637
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:51,780
cheering on those firing squads
as they were killing Jews. Uh,

638
00:36:51,781 --> 00:36:54,660
that's what happens.
You can poison an entire mindset.

639
00:36:54,661 --> 00:36:58,830
So it's amazing that it's within
our grasp. Historically. Look,

640
00:36:58,831 --> 00:36:59,910
we can see things,

641
00:36:59,911 --> 00:37:04,140
we can have photos and video because
things like this have happened.

642
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:08,030
This is, this is their worst than
you can imagine. They're there.

643
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:11,910
As you read exodus and I, I studied Nazi
Germany was my area of focus in, in,

644
00:37:11,911 --> 00:37:12,744
in college.
But,

645
00:37:12,990 --> 00:37:16,680
but if you read that book and he brings
it down in such a personal level,

646
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:20,310
it is the unthinkable and it's
the unspeakable. And it's like,

647
00:37:20,311 --> 00:37:25,080
it's almost like it was the first event
of that magnitude or horrific event of

648
00:37:25,081 --> 00:37:27,470
that magnitude where, you know, a,

649
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:32,480
her travel had just become like a sort
of a big player in the way the world

650
00:37:32,491 --> 00:37:37,230
functions because people could fly
over you and drop shit on these things

651
00:37:37,231 --> 00:37:39,630
changed very quickly.
They accelerated very quickly.

652
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:44,700
And it's just amazing that it's all
within our capability of recording it and

653
00:37:45,001 --> 00:37:48,480
watching it, if that's right. But here's
the big difference too. Back then,

654
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:51,660
nobody was watching it. Nobody was
seeing what was going on in the,

655
00:37:51,690 --> 00:37:55,050
the Russian countryside,
you know, stop. Hitler said,

656
00:37:55,051 --> 00:37:57,990
I want to get rid of is to hit Stalin.
Hitler said,

657
00:37:57,991 --> 00:38:01,980
I want to make part of the Russian
countryside habitable for Germans.

658
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:04,530
And so what he said is we have
to just get rid of all the,

659
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:07,670
all the Bolsheviks that's just kill
everybody who's their kid. Just,

660
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,780
just empty the villages of people.

661
00:38:09,930 --> 00:38:13,350
So what they would do is they would have
these soldiers come in and they would

662
00:38:13,351 --> 00:38:17,200
dig these huge mass pits and shoot
everybody into the pit. Oh Man.

663
00:38:17,330 --> 00:38:20,190
That's how bad it was.
And so at the end of World War Two,

664
00:38:20,191 --> 00:38:22,610
there were 50 million people dead.
The wow.

665
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:27,000
How do you get that many people to do
that? How much? How does that happen?

666
00:38:27,001 --> 00:38:30,360
What is the, that's a very good question.
Let me put it this way. And in, in,

667
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:35,160
and I believe these are the numbers,
but by the 1943 in Birkenau, Birkenau,

668
00:38:35,350 --> 00:38:37,360
which was about a mile away
from Auschwitz, so it's,

669
00:38:37,361 --> 00:38:39,520
I'm saying Auschwitz in Auschwitz,
let's call it Auschwitz.

670
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,870
They were probably killing
close to 40,000 people a day.

671
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:45,520
And the way they would do it as this,

672
00:38:45,521 --> 00:38:49,510
what they found was that when they
brought people in and it was at a peak,

673
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:52,330
is this a constant
steady stream? Yes. Yes.

674
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:56,410
That's why they were able to
kill 6 million Jews. And Look,

675
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,700
and let me explain something to you.

676
00:38:58,060 --> 00:39:00,730
And it's important if that on
those numbers for a second,

677
00:39:00,731 --> 00:39:01,830
because there's just the overwhelming,

678
00:39:02,010 --> 00:39:03,950
the number of the
overwhelmingly for killing.

679
00:39:03,951 --> 00:39:07,330
And these are children are children and
these are women and these are infants.

680
00:39:07,331 --> 00:39:09,040
And they all had names and they all had,

681
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:11,590
they all had families
and they all connection.

682
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:13,960
They were all as human as you and I,
and it's very,

683
00:39:13,961 --> 00:39:16,450
it's very natural for us to kind of say,
well,

684
00:39:16,451 --> 00:39:18,880
that was a long time ago and they may
have looked at life differently. No,

685
00:39:18,881 --> 00:39:20,740
they had all the same dreams.
They had all the same hopes,

686
00:39:20,741 --> 00:39:24,190
they had all the same love.
They all had all the same bonds and it's,

687
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:28,510
it's overwhelming and too much for your
heart to bear if you really think about

688
00:39:28,690 --> 00:39:32,530
what human beings have done to other
human beings, especially the Holocaust.

689
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:36,280
It's why the Holocaust that that
word, that word, the Holocaust,

690
00:39:36,281 --> 00:39:40,030
which I believe means the great
fire or a derivation of that.

691
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:45,300
That's why that word is used only for
that specific event in history because

692
00:39:45,431 --> 00:39:48,700
they did get burned. They did get
put in ovens and they did get that.

693
00:39:48,701 --> 00:39:52,450
They're all trace of them was washed
away because as the Russians and the

694
00:39:52,451 --> 00:39:55,840
Americans closed in on those camps,
they had to get rid of all the evidence.

695
00:39:55,870 --> 00:39:59,890
So they blew up all those gas
chambers. They, they burn the bodies,

696
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:02,350
they crush the skulls,
and they would use other Jews to do it.

697
00:40:02,351 --> 00:40:03,430
They would make you do it.

698
00:40:03,431 --> 00:40:08,010
So you'd be 14 unloading bodies out of
a fucking think about this. I mean it's,

699
00:40:08,011 --> 00:40:10,480
it's as crazy as it gets, right?
It says worse than it did,

700
00:40:10,481 --> 00:40:13,960
prayed as it as it possibly gets.
But the way you get people to go about it,

701
00:40:13,961 --> 00:40:17,190
it's two things. One is
deception, one is, and,

702
00:40:17,191 --> 00:40:19,020
and human beings have always done it.
And I'm going to,

703
00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:21,820
I'll explain why we're in a living in
a world where it's harder to do, but,

704
00:40:21,821 --> 00:40:25,960
but what you do is just misinformation.
Propaganda. You say, hey,

705
00:40:25,961 --> 00:40:29,310
guess who's causing all
your financial problems? Uh,

706
00:40:29,311 --> 00:40:33,790
a group called the Jews or our group
called the Chinese or a group called the

707
00:40:33,791 --> 00:40:36,100
blacks and there,
and by the way,

708
00:40:36,101 --> 00:40:39,040
they also kill their own
kids and their subhuman.

709
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:44,220
And you take young men who
have no education or have
been educated specifically

710
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:48,970
and they're full of fire and what they
go to war for us to protect what they

711
00:40:48,971 --> 00:40:52,870
considered their way of life. See, I
don't think people go to war for hatred.

712
00:40:52,930 --> 00:40:54,290
I think people go to war because they,

713
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:56,530
they're in love with their way of life
and they're trying to protect their

714
00:40:56,531 --> 00:40:58,960
families. They're trying to
protect their way of life.

715
00:40:59,170 --> 00:41:02,380
And that's how you create a real
soldier and a dedicated patriot.

716
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:07,570
You create a sense of misinformation
and young men who are 18 and 19 are not

717
00:41:07,571 --> 00:41:09,580
asking questions.
They're trying to be a hero.

718
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:13,060
And if it means having to kill all those
bad guys over there and even their kids

719
00:41:13,061 --> 00:41:15,760
and their, their women, while the kids
are, when women are kind of sub human,

720
00:41:15,761 --> 00:41:20,050
you always, you always quit a sub human
context for the other, for the enemy.

721
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:23,140
And that's, that's
what, but the good news,

722
00:41:23,170 --> 00:41:27,970
the good news in 2011 is
that it's becoming harder
and harder to do because of

723
00:41:27,971 --> 00:41:30,520
the Internet. And we're all
getting closer and closer together.

724
00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:35,570
And it's easier to kind of empathize
somebody when you see them suffering when

725
00:41:35,571 --> 00:41:38,120
we'll videotape doesn't lie.
And when you can,

726
00:41:38,121 --> 00:41:43,121
when you can hear their voices and you
can hear and they create political bodies

727
00:41:43,131 --> 00:41:45,920
and groups. And they
say, you know, look, we,

728
00:41:45,921 --> 00:41:50,610
we believe and we cry just
like you do. Right. And, and,

729
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:51,201
and that's,

730
00:41:51,201 --> 00:41:56,201
that's what I think has a lot to do
with breaking down these natural tribal

731
00:41:57,051 --> 00:42:01,190
tendencies of human beings have because
human beings are tribal. We are tribal.

732
00:42:01,430 --> 00:42:04,820
Even if you belong to one martial arts
school, it's so natural for you to go,

733
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:07,580
yeah, we're better though. Those guys
over there kind of. Yeah, they're fucking,

734
00:42:07,970 --> 00:42:10,810
they do that thug jet too. We do
the original pure, you know, you,

735
00:42:10,830 --> 00:42:14,690
you'll find that an [inaudible],
right. We're tribal and look at teams.

736
00:42:14,691 --> 00:42:18,740
But the nationalism involved in my team
versus your team, I mean, you know,

737
00:42:18,741 --> 00:42:23,480
these big rivalries. So the, but the
good news is that I believe that,

738
00:42:23,481 --> 00:42:24,380
and I may be naive,

739
00:42:24,381 --> 00:42:29,381
but I don't think so that pulling off
something as horrific as what happened in

740
00:42:29,451 --> 00:42:31,610
the Holocaust would be very difficult.

741
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:35,810
Very difficult today and almost probably
impossible because too many of us would

742
00:42:35,811 --> 00:42:40,400
go, this is outrageous. I don't think
it would get as as bad as the Holocaust,

743
00:42:40,401 --> 00:42:44,510
but I think it's happening right now.
Well, it happened in Rwanda and the 90s.

744
00:42:44,930 --> 00:42:49,920
Right. And uh, and that was, that wasn't
the, that was the, yeah. Yeah. And,

745
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:54,200
and those places again are pretty remote
and still haven't, but most of Africa,

746
00:42:54,201 --> 00:42:57,480
I can't remember the number,
but there are an inordinate amount of um,

747
00:42:57,620 --> 00:43:01,040
cell phones in Africa.
And during the violence in Kenya recently,

748
00:43:01,430 --> 00:43:06,430
people started videotaping soldiers
raping women and they started tweeting and

749
00:43:06,861 --> 00:43:09,800
texting where the concentration
of violence was happening.

750
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:13,940
So people were able to avoid that. So
what's happening is just like in Mexico,

751
00:43:13,941 --> 00:43:17,690
at the drug cartels, people are
being empowered by social media.

752
00:43:17,870 --> 00:43:20,140
And when they see a house
where drug activities going on,

753
00:43:20,150 --> 00:43:22,040
they can just tweet it
anonymously in the cops,

754
00:43:22,041 --> 00:43:25,100
go and find it so they don't have
to worry about retribution. So the,

755
00:43:25,101 --> 00:43:26,150
a lot of these things,

756
00:43:26,151 --> 00:43:31,151
a lot of the social media is a really
good thing because it's creating,

757
00:43:31,790 --> 00:43:34,760
it's truly democratizing power.

758
00:43:34,790 --> 00:43:37,540
It's really spacing power out.
And,

759
00:43:37,541 --> 00:43:42,380
and in some ways it makes for, um,
it makes for a better place to live.

760
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:46,920
Know, could you imagine if you had
a move to Africa? Cause you'll have,

761
00:43:46,970 --> 00:43:50,630
imagine if something happened,
like America doesn't like
Brian Calendar anymore.

762
00:43:50,631 --> 00:43:52,810
You've got to get out of the country.
I've been to Africa twice, you know,

763
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:55,410
I know what if you have to live there,
I'm sure there's nice place.

764
00:43:55,411 --> 00:43:57,470
There are very nice places of
Africa but for the most part,

765
00:43:57,471 --> 00:44:00,200
and you'd probably want to be in the
United States to live in the Congo.

766
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:02,070
Could you imagine that?

767
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:06,800
That would suck that Japan has had
another fucking earthquake by the way.

768
00:44:06,801 --> 00:44:09,200
7.0 like three days ago.

769
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:13,850
And I think right off site
Tokyo like in the water,

770
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:18,830
like a 7.0 all the shit makes me
wonder when I got to get ready,

771
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:21,560
do I need guns?
So I need to start scoring water.

772
00:44:21,561 --> 00:44:23,390
What are we going to do
as an earthquake in Ohio?

773
00:44:23,391 --> 00:44:27,140
And they found out where there's some
controversy dead that it might be because

774
00:44:27,141 --> 00:44:30,710
they're drilling for wells and that they
actually had to shut it down because

775
00:44:30,711 --> 00:44:32,110
there was recent,
uh,

776
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:34,110
activity from this drilling.

777
00:44:34,250 --> 00:44:38,340
Like they've noticed that the activity
has been higher than normal and so they

778
00:44:38,341 --> 00:44:41,730
shut it down. And then like, uh,
just a little bit of time later,

779
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:45,420
there was a 4.3 earthquake and Youngstown,
Ohio.

780
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:49,540
That's possible. They said that you can
do that. They say they can start some,

781
00:44:49,570 --> 00:44:54,390
some sort of minor movements with like
some hardcore drilling kind of makes

782
00:44:54,391 --> 00:44:57,430
sense if you drill a gonna fault,
you know it seems like, yeah,

783
00:44:57,431 --> 00:44:59,910
but that is that you want
to fuck it up for good.

784
00:45:00,340 --> 00:45:02,610
Now we're going to be
earthquakes all the time in Ohio.

785
00:45:02,620 --> 00:45:04,020
Would you imagine if they did,

786
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:07,560
if they just the greedy fucks if they
just drilled the hole the wrong spot and

787
00:45:07,561 --> 00:45:12,561
now it's like the worst fault line ever
and you can't really blame them because

788
00:45:12,961 --> 00:45:14,700
no one,
there's no real science behind me.

789
00:45:14,701 --> 00:45:19,100
It's really difficult for you to do prove
whether we know what caused maybe all

790
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:23,090
these earthquakes we're going to
happen anyway. And they wrote,

791
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:26,610
we actually have a thousand wells that
we've done in Ohio and in Pennsylvania

792
00:45:26,611 --> 00:45:31,470
and we've never had a problem before.
The drill.

793
00:45:31,471 --> 00:45:36,471
1,000 gigantic holds a thousand that's
so weird to like ten one hundred

794
00:45:38,550 --> 00:45:41,160
you know you really got that fault line.
Good guys.

795
00:45:41,190 --> 00:45:42,870
Just think about that a hundred

796
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:48,330
oh fire under those states because we
have a water source shorters and parts of

797
00:45:48,331 --> 00:45:52,410
this country and but apparently
there's a massive aquafyer that that,

798
00:45:52,470 --> 00:45:55,980
that they say is going to push a
lot of industry in that direction.

799
00:45:55,981 --> 00:46:00,270
Like properties. What do you mean by
Aquafyer? I mean under a stream of water.

800
00:46:00,330 --> 00:46:03,840
There's a massive natural
reservoir of water. Really?

801
00:46:04,530 --> 00:46:07,230
Shit weird.
Is it agriculture?

802
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:10,700
It has all these creepy fucking
layers underneath us. You know,

803
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:12,250
we're just living on this crust.

804
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:16,090
We don't like to think that man
just right under you. You know,

805
00:46:16,091 --> 00:46:17,870
whatever it is on my own.
What are from

806
00:46:17,870 --> 00:46:20,960
what the Colorado River, I mean this
is where the La doesn't have water.

807
00:46:21,530 --> 00:46:22,540
There's no water different.

808
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:27,150
We had to divert water from the Colorado
River and the Owens valley is just to

809
00:46:27,151 --> 00:46:28,650
ride the fuck out.
Like,

810
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:31,580
that's what Chinatowns about where the
[inaudible] valley had all these farmers

811
00:46:31,581 --> 00:46:34,730
and this way of life and they were
like the powers that be came in and go,

812
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:37,630
we need to, we need to grow a fucking
orange groves. And by the way,

813
00:46:37,670 --> 00:46:40,520
let's start the movie industry here
because the weather is predictable. Oh,

814
00:46:40,521 --> 00:46:44,660
we need water. Ah, fuck the Owens valley
rather redirect the river over this way.

815
00:46:44,661 --> 00:46:47,360
And they, all these farmers were
like, my fucking sheep are dying.

816
00:46:47,361 --> 00:46:50,630
I don't have any water. And
then, then they went fucking
nuts. But they were like,

817
00:46:50,631 --> 00:46:54,800
sorry, we have the money. Wow. That's
what happened. What a creep move.

818
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:58,430
They stole their fucking river.
They'd dried out a whole fucking valley.

819
00:46:58,850 --> 00:47:03,460
They stole their water. Isn't it amazing
you can do that? You could decide power.

820
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:06,890
He could decide, well, I like
the people that affects. That's,

821
00:47:07,070 --> 00:47:09,960
that's when guys had power, like
smoking a cigar going, let's just, uh,

822
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:13,880
let's just divert the river. So what
do you mean sir? The Colorado River,

823
00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:16,850
one of the biggest rivers in the country.
Yeah,

824
00:47:16,851 --> 00:47:20,090
let's do that until they created
that salt and sea. Right.

825
00:47:20,330 --> 00:47:23,070
I guess and then what it is.
I don't know. Some did alum,

826
00:47:23,071 --> 00:47:25,510
I might be talking out of my ass.
I think it's

827
00:47:27,290 --> 00:47:31,240
natural lakes in this, we're all,
and that result of just, you know,

828
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:36,040
figuring out a way to get water to
land so you could grow food. Yeah.

829
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:40,570
Is really a ridiculous place to live.
It's a fucking desert. So stupid. It is.

830
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:43,930
But as long as the water could get taken
away at any time and we're just like,

831
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:48,210
fuck it, it's 73 degrees and breezy
you all the time was 93 when,

832
00:47:49,340 --> 00:47:53,830
so it's always really nice. Today was 85
degrees. He was 93 minutes driving. Jesus.

833
00:47:53,831 --> 00:47:58,180
That's insane. I like it.
It's beautiful. I love is in
January. I love the heat, man.

834
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:01,210
It's a lot better than fucking freezing
your ass hawk. And I'll tell you what,

835
00:48:01,211 --> 00:48:05,020
it's a lot better than black
ice and dealing with Boston.

836
00:48:05,021 --> 00:48:08,410
I looked at high Sierra dude the
winter times driving it scared.

837
00:48:08,411 --> 00:48:11,600
I remember going to high school up in
New England and I would met the nostrils

838
00:48:11,620 --> 00:48:15,190
that deep my nostrils,
the mucus in my nostrils would freeze.

839
00:48:15,310 --> 00:48:19,840
Walking from one firm to
breakfast next Thursday. Joe,

840
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:24,730
I've been on the highway before and uh,
watched it rain and washed the rain.

841
00:48:24,790 --> 00:48:28,360
Just sort of start sticking to
your windshield. You're like,

842
00:48:28,361 --> 00:48:29,680
what the fuck is going on here?

843
00:48:29,830 --> 00:48:33,610
The rain was like just beginning to
s to to turn into, I like Christmas.

844
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:38,530
It was just beginning to become icy
rain and then the entire road became a

845
00:48:38,531 --> 00:48:43,180
skating rink to anyone's
just slide into a ditch.

846
00:48:43,210 --> 00:48:45,370
I'm going to do it. Everybody would
just wait. Have you been caught?

847
00:48:45,371 --> 00:48:47,920
You ever been caught in a hailstorm?
Oh yeah.

848
00:48:48,110 --> 00:48:50,910
It's a New Mexico in the summertime
and I got caught in a hailstorm,

849
00:48:50,950 --> 00:48:53,570
like huge hailstone.
So New Mexico's got home,

850
00:48:54,250 --> 00:48:58,400
they got legit hail got hail that they
put on Youtube. Yeah, it's crazy. Yeah.

851
00:48:58,420 --> 00:49:02,590
I golf balls and the whole city had it
and everybody's cards with or fucked up

852
00:49:02,650 --> 00:49:05,140
and everybody does the same
thing I did, which is like, Oh,

853
00:49:05,141 --> 00:49:06,610
they gave me $1,200 to fix it.

854
00:49:06,670 --> 00:49:10,300
I'm just keeping the money and buying
some x box games and stuff so everybody's

855
00:49:10,301 --> 00:49:13,600
cards had we're fucked up.
Like for years.

856
00:49:13,990 --> 00:49:17,200
Their dog's got jacked, peoples
got, dogs got fucked up.

857
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:21,640
There's one video that I watched
this kid put a a video up of.

858
00:49:21,641 --> 00:49:24,790
It's starting and he didn't know how bad
it was going to get because it was so

859
00:49:24,791 --> 00:49:28,420
crazy. It was like, oh my God, this
fucking, this, this tail is so bad.

860
00:49:28,421 --> 00:49:29,820
We had to film it. So He's, look,

861
00:49:29,821 --> 00:49:32,530
you're filming in his backyard and it's
coming down, man. You're watching it,

862
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:37,120
but then as he's filming it,
it just turns into the preposterous.

863
00:49:37,330 --> 00:49:38,830
It turns into the end of time.

864
00:49:39,100 --> 00:49:42,490
It turns into a fucking shotgun of ice.

865
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:47,520
It's coming out of the sky every second
to mean his fucking pool is exploding.

866
00:49:50,450 --> 00:49:54,190
Exploding with splashes. Yes. Yeah.
There's a lot of them. Oh my God,

867
00:49:54,191 --> 00:49:55,900
you can't believe it.
It's the most horrific.

868
00:49:56,180 --> 00:50:00,450
The thought that you could be on your way
home from somewhere or walk home. Yeah,

869
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:02,800
but you've got headphones on.
I don't even know what's happening.

870
00:50:04,030 --> 00:50:06,790
You get hit with the first ice
pellets. I ain't, that's what,

871
00:50:08,350 --> 00:50:09,910
that's what I was talking
about. Okay. That's the,

872
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:12,630
that's the random shit that drives me.
I don't want to die randomly.

873
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:13,840
Like for example,
how about this?

874
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:18,430
I told you the story where the couple
is driving down the fucking highway and

875
00:50:18,431 --> 00:50:21,280
they hit a bear 60 miles
an hour there it goes,

876
00:50:21,281 --> 00:50:25,180
flying into the other lane and kills
the people coming in this way. Oh my

877
00:50:26,710 --> 00:50:30,800
God. Flying fucking bear.
Wow, that's annoying.

878
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:35,390
Can't bear proof your windshield. Okay. It
happened in West Hollywood. I saw, dude,

879
00:50:35,391 --> 00:50:40,040
what a thing on his car for a deer though.
When I lived in Colorado,

880
00:50:40,041 --> 00:50:43,820
he had this bad ass fucking
battering Ram Fraley grill.

881
00:50:43,970 --> 00:50:45,920
He had a pickup truck and he was a hunter.

882
00:50:46,180 --> 00:50:49,490
I here kill more people than any
other show. A lot of people, man,

883
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:52,380
you gotta be really careful.
They're crazy. They just, you know,

884
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:55,790
they have nutty instincts that just leap
out in front of cars and I don't think

885
00:50:55,791 --> 00:50:59,690
they quite understand something can move
as fast as a car because in nature they,

886
00:50:59,691 --> 00:51:03,980
I think they get a lot more of a warning
then that judge cause the cars on one

887
00:51:03,981 --> 00:51:05,930
level.
So when it's coming at you on a highway,

888
00:51:05,931 --> 00:51:09,140
you can't tell it fast because it
operates on the same plane. Oh.

889
00:51:09,141 --> 00:51:13,340
So cause it's not jumping up and
down runs or a Predator runs,

890
00:51:13,341 --> 00:51:16,250
they stay on one level.
They're not jumping up and down.

891
00:51:16,251 --> 00:51:18,740
Whereas it cause hell is jumping up
and down. Right. You can, you can,

892
00:51:18,770 --> 00:51:22,280
you can measure how fast they're
going. But when uh, physics wise,

893
00:51:22,281 --> 00:51:24,470
when something is operating
along the same plane,

894
00:51:24,471 --> 00:51:25,910
it's much harder to judge their speed.

895
00:51:25,910 --> 00:51:27,980
That's why when you're on a
highway and cars coming at you,

896
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:31,460
you can't tell what's going 90
or 60 staying at the same level.

897
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:35,510
Now is it an efficiency thing
for a cat or something like that?

898
00:51:35,511 --> 00:51:38,420
More more apparently more
just the evolution wise. It's,

899
00:51:38,421 --> 00:51:42,610
it's so the animal can't tell
how fast it's coming to racing.

900
00:51:43,430 --> 00:51:47,020
It doesn't run according. It
just runs right. But, but,

901
00:51:47,060 --> 00:51:50,340
but the cat looks like it's farther
away from you then if it was John.

902
00:51:50,341 --> 00:51:52,220
And it's also hard to see.
It's also staying,

903
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:54,440
it's also staying low on the foliage.

904
00:51:54,590 --> 00:51:58,700
There's a cool video of a guest
South America's Jaguars, right?

905
00:51:59,060 --> 00:52:03,740
It's a Jaguar eating a giant rat
like thing Kappy Berra. Yeah,

906
00:52:03,741 --> 00:52:07,310
that's exactly what it is on video.
But they're number one.

907
00:52:07,311 --> 00:52:11,400
This dude's filmed it
[inaudible] 90 pounds.

908
00:52:11,690 --> 00:52:15,970
It's enormous. It's like the
size of a big fucking dog man.

909
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:20,060
And this Jaguar is sitting
there just completely frozen,

910
00:52:20,180 --> 00:52:22,490
like not moving at all.
And the video takes like,

911
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:26,630
it takes four minutes of the Jaguar doing
nothing until he launches himself on

912
00:52:26,631 --> 00:52:30,830
this thing with Jaguars, which are very
big. Cats will eat a human right quick.

913
00:52:30,860 --> 00:52:32,420
You, you the one, the one hand,

914
00:52:32,421 --> 00:52:36,020
the one cat you don't want to be around
is the Jaguar more than anything else,

915
00:52:36,021 --> 00:52:38,360
including a tiger. You don't want to
fuck around with it. But you know,

916
00:52:38,361 --> 00:52:39,870
when people take Iowasca,

917
00:52:39,910 --> 00:52:43,640
that's that DMT beverage that
they take in South America.

918
00:52:43,940 --> 00:52:46,640
One of the big visions that
people have is Jaguars.

919
00:52:46,641 --> 00:52:51,110
They have lot of Jaguar visions. Did
you, you know, my buddy works for, um,

920
00:52:51,650 --> 00:52:54,680
like the secret service,
you know, and you know,

921
00:52:54,681 --> 00:52:58,460
they get calls all the time because like
sometimes they'll get there for foreign

922
00:52:58,461 --> 00:53:02,080
service guys who go in and nail,
they'll fucking take like gr.

923
00:53:02,150 --> 00:53:05,810
They try to mix in with the locals and
I'll take drugs and then they'll just end

924
00:53:05,811 --> 00:53:09,170
up in the middle of the fucking
Amazon or the Congo and they have to,

925
00:53:09,290 --> 00:53:12,890
they have to get a search team to go find
them cause they took some fucking drug.

926
00:53:13,220 --> 00:53:17,390
And there are several stories like
that. Or how about this, how about this?

927
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:20,090
If the guy during the Haiti,

928
00:53:21,650 --> 00:53:22,850
not during this earthquake,

929
00:53:22,851 --> 00:53:25,740
but there was another disaster back
in the nineties people were trying to

930
00:53:25,741 --> 00:53:26,160
emigrate

931
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:30,330
to the states. Right. And I'm
the guy, they had one dude,

932
00:53:30,331 --> 00:53:35,331
some young dude who is like basically at
the embassy who there's a long line of

933
00:53:35,941 --> 00:53:38,250
people trying to immigrate to the u s
and none of them were getting it, right.

934
00:53:38,251 --> 00:53:41,040
So you basically just go with denied.
Denied, denied. This is one they had.

935
00:53:41,041 --> 00:53:44,250
This one young guy was like a shit
assignment there, right? And it's hot.

936
00:53:44,251 --> 00:53:47,730
There's a fan on them. And he started,
he just like, people kept lining up.

937
00:53:47,930 --> 00:53:50,790
He just kept going. He kept
going, denied, fucking denied.

938
00:53:50,910 --> 00:53:55,830
Finally started going stir crazy. Right?
And, and uh, he had this little, um,

939
00:53:55,890 --> 00:54:00,880
what's that? Star Wars? Well, who's a star
wars character? Both of fit well of that.

940
00:54:00,950 --> 00:54:03,420
And bubba fat. Okay. So we have
a little Boba Fett all there.

941
00:54:03,690 --> 00:54:04,590
And so he started going,

942
00:54:04,591 --> 00:54:08,880
he just started going crazy and the guy
would come up and he'd go, hold on, sorry.

943
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:12,600
I boba Fett says denied. Sorry. And
he start doing that. The beaver,

944
00:54:12,601 --> 00:54:16,260
that's like Mel Gibson's
movie. Okay. Well, so he starts
going, Boba Fett says no,

945
00:54:16,261 --> 00:54:16,740
right?

946
00:54:16,740 --> 00:54:21,740
Cause not all of a sudden the people
started giving him Boba Fett offerings.

947
00:54:23,610 --> 00:54:26,370
Okay. So like, like a week later,

948
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:31,410
Boba Fett has a fucking pile of
everything from food to cigarettes,

949
00:54:31,411 --> 00:54:33,990
like a whole mountain like right here.
Okay.

950
00:54:34,230 --> 00:54:38,160
Then then a block markets are
developing over a Boba Fett dolls,

951
00:54:38,161 --> 00:54:39,030
Boba Fett costumes.

952
00:54:39,031 --> 00:54:42,120
And people started coming up with Boba
Fett costumes and dolls and stuff trying

953
00:54:42,121 --> 00:54:44,400
to get in because they thought that
was kind of who you had to talk to.

954
00:54:44,570 --> 00:54:45,600
And I figured the sky was,

955
00:54:45,690 --> 00:54:48,680
they figured this guy's obviously talking
about the fat and this guy and he's up

956
00:54:48,730 --> 00:54:51,450
Boba Fett fanatics.
So we should show allegiance to Boba Fett.

957
00:54:51,690 --> 00:54:54,150
So people were coming and trusts like
Boba Fett and the u s embassy had to be

958
00:54:54,151 --> 00:54:55,740
like, all right, we got
to fucking stop this,

959
00:54:55,741 --> 00:54:58,980
take that fucking doll out outta
here right fucking now as this will.

960
00:54:59,070 --> 00:55:03,180
Cause the guy was like, Hey, yes,
I'm more money. Yes, thank you.

961
00:55:03,210 --> 00:55:06,300
Thank you very much. And Boba
Fett says, no, I'm sorry.

962
00:55:06,301 --> 00:55:08,730
And the guy who dressed like Boba Fett,
like what the fuck?

963
00:55:08,790 --> 00:55:12,890
It's amazing that that guy got so
far that just shows you that was,

964
00:55:12,930 --> 00:55:13,711
that was a story.

965
00:55:13,711 --> 00:55:16,890
That was a story that this guy was as
foreign foreign service guy told me about.

966
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:20,550
Oh, by the way, my other buddy buddy
came to visit me. I can't say his name,

967
00:55:20,551 --> 00:55:24,120
but he's a CIA guy or something like that.
I don't know what he does,

968
00:55:24,121 --> 00:55:26,340
but I know he's been under a rock
for 10 years and Afghanistan.

969
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:30,750
He was telling me about that fucking what
the waste that goes on. How about this?

970
00:55:31,230 --> 00:55:35,130
How about this? In in Iraq,
they, they, it's a desert, right?

971
00:55:35,490 --> 00:55:40,020
They spent $100,000 importing
sand for volleyball courts,

972
00:55:40,260 --> 00:55:40,901
so they had to,

973
00:55:40,901 --> 00:55:45,450
they brought $100,000 worth of sand in
for the volleyball courts as opposed to

974
00:55:45,451 --> 00:55:46,860
just getting the sand in Iraq.

975
00:55:46,860 --> 00:55:49,500
I'm sure you could find fucking
sand somewhere in Iraq. Nah,

976
00:55:49,710 --> 00:55:53,490
let's import it from the states because
everybody's got their fucking mouths at

977
00:55:53,491 --> 00:55:56,130
the government trough and
when you got a war going on,

978
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:59,160
there's so much money to be made and
everybody does it and it's just a

979
00:55:59,161 --> 00:56:02,850
confluence of fucking events in everybody.
Everybody who goes there,

980
00:56:02,851 --> 00:56:06,470
you'd have a project, you have money and
you want to build a big dam or a power,

981
00:56:06,530 --> 00:56:09,300
a power, a big power plant, right?

982
00:56:10,170 --> 00:56:13,050
It doesn't matter if the
fucking Iraqis needed or not.

983
00:56:13,110 --> 00:56:16,920
What matters that you burn your money.
You get judged by your burn rate, okay.

984
00:56:17,130 --> 00:56:18,390
And it has you, you, you,

985
00:56:18,391 --> 00:56:22,950
you have a certain allotted a budget
and you have to get a fucking huge power

986
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:24,610
plant. Whether it's needed, there are not.

987
00:56:24,730 --> 00:56:29,050
The point is to get it done because
then you get a promotion or your aunt or

988
00:56:29,051 --> 00:56:33,580
your project is a success and that shit
was going on and continues to go on in

989
00:56:33,581 --> 00:56:35,680
Iraq for the past 10 fucking years.

990
00:56:35,860 --> 00:56:40,240
The waste is so outrageous.
It's ridiculous.

991
00:56:40,810 --> 00:56:43,600
By the way. You know the,
the Iraqis you're not,

992
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:46,990
do you know how much oil we've gotten
from the Rockies? How much oil revenue?

993
00:56:47,020 --> 00:56:49,120
None.
It's all gone into her rocky coffers.

994
00:56:49,121 --> 00:56:53,200
This whole thing costs us a fucking
fortune. And let me go on. Let me go on.

995
00:56:53,950 --> 00:56:58,120
Maliki is creating his own secret service.

996
00:56:58,121 --> 00:57:01,570
Police forces that direct report directly
to him. Does that sound familiar?

997
00:57:01,660 --> 00:57:04,900
So we fucking take the country
apart and now we're creating.

998
00:57:04,901 --> 00:57:09,460
We're leaving behind Saddam light. See
you later. Thanks a lot guys. We uh,

999
00:57:09,461 --> 00:57:12,730
you know he's consolidating power, keeping
the Sunni's out. So as soon as like,

1000
00:57:12,731 --> 00:57:15,010
fuck you, we're going to lose all our,
we're going to lose all the resources.

1001
00:57:15,011 --> 00:57:16,630
You guys are sitting,
all the resources in the south.

1002
00:57:16,631 --> 00:57:19,270
We're going to bomb the fucking shit out
of you guys until you come back to the

1003
00:57:19,271 --> 00:57:22,210
bargaining table. Hey, civil war in Iraq.

1004
00:57:22,390 --> 00:57:26,080
It's fucking a tragic past that.
But,

1005
00:57:26,380 --> 00:57:29,050
but you know who was calling
all that shit? A lot of people,

1006
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:32,710
including this fucking idiot. And
I'm an actor and I, and I, I said,

1007
00:57:32,830 --> 00:57:35,770
how are you going to stop the Sudanese
and this she has from getting into a war

1008
00:57:35,771 --> 00:57:37,270
after all the shit breaks down.

1009
00:57:37,390 --> 00:57:40,690
And how do you stop the Shia who are a
majority from aligning themselves with

1010
00:57:40,691 --> 00:57:43,260
Iran are number one
enemy. Huh? That's weird.

1011
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:48,040
Wasn't Iraq kind of a who playing a sort
of a countervailing force to a Iran.

1012
00:57:48,070 --> 00:57:51,130
I'm an actor and I was asking that
question. I'm an actor and you know what?

1013
00:57:51,220 --> 00:57:53,110
I read one newspaper a day,
that's all.

1014
00:57:53,111 --> 00:57:55,570
I don't know anything and these
fucking guys couldn't figure that out.

1015
00:57:55,630 --> 00:57:59,840
So why is it so why do you think that
our foreign policies so self destruct?

1016
00:57:59,860 --> 00:58:01,540
I asked him,
I asked him that question and,

1017
00:58:01,550 --> 00:58:04,090
and obviously there's a lot
of people are making a profit,

1018
00:58:04,091 --> 00:58:07,270
but it almost seems like burning
the farm down had a great answer.

1019
00:58:07,300 --> 00:58:10,810
He had a great answer cause I said, how
much of this is like a, a group of men,

1020
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:14,620
a cabal of evil men or how much of
the centrally planned or people have

1021
00:58:14,621 --> 00:58:17,380
different interests? And he said, dude,
he goes, it's not like that. He said,

1022
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:19,820
what it is is there's
just a whole bunch of the,

1023
00:58:19,821 --> 00:58:22,750
and I'll give you another
example of what's happening
there. I said, what is this?

1024
00:58:22,751 --> 00:58:27,110
There's a whole bunch of interests
working a whole bunch of money to me and

1025
00:58:27,190 --> 00:58:31,330
everybody has different opinions and some
opinions when the day and others don't.

1026
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:34,090
Right. And so the State
Department has their own agenda.

1027
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:37,510
The executive have that has their agenda
and everybody has their own agenda.

1028
00:58:37,510 --> 00:58:42,340
But ultimately enough shit starts to
be kind of like talked about where you

1029
00:58:42,341 --> 00:58:43,840
start creating an enemy.

1030
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:47,710
You start saying this might be a good
idea for the following reasons and pretty

1031
00:58:47,711 --> 00:58:50,950
soon there's so much,
there's so many sort of, um,

1032
00:58:51,010 --> 00:58:55,360
there's so many groups of people that
have a vested interest in going in.

1033
00:58:55,361 --> 00:58:57,610
And usually it's an intellectual
interests. Usually it's like,

1034
00:58:57,611 --> 00:59:00,370
I think we can bring democracy
to the Middle East. Uh,

1035
00:59:00,390 --> 00:59:03,670
and that's a very grandiose idea and
grandiose plan. Oh, and by the way,

1036
00:59:03,671 --> 00:59:05,410
because it's going to make the
world safer. At the end of the day,

1037
00:59:05,411 --> 00:59:08,200
they're a lot of idealistic
people involved in this.
Well, not just money people.

1038
00:59:08,590 --> 00:59:11,720
And all of a sudden all the shit
starts to come together. And,

1039
00:59:11,790 --> 00:59:14,320
and before you know it, you're fucking
on your way to a war, you know?

1040
00:59:14,321 --> 00:59:17,110
And the way he described it
made a lot of sense. It's just,

1041
00:59:17,140 --> 00:59:20,050
it's like a tidal wave. It's like starts
as a snowball. And before, you know,

1042
00:59:20,170 --> 00:59:23,930
you got a fucking massive tsunami
on your hands up. Just momentum.

1043
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:28,730
And there's just so many interests in is
so much movement in one direction that

1044
00:59:28,731 --> 00:59:32,420
what are you gonna do then call it off?
No, you got weapons of mass destruction.

1045
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:35,180
He's used to before. Let's go, let's go,

1046
00:59:35,240 --> 00:59:38,930
let's go take out the fourth largest
army in the world because it's not safe.

1047
00:59:39,290 --> 00:59:43,220
And, uh, you know, let's, let's,
let's make the world a better place.

1048
00:59:43,221 --> 00:59:45,680
And you get a bunch of
people like that who do it.

1049
00:59:45,950 --> 00:59:48,050
And then of course you get a lot of
people, if you haven't seen, it's gone.

1050
00:59:48,051 --> 00:59:52,520
We can make a lot of fucking money.
Boeing, Lockheed, Raytheon saying, dude,

1051
00:59:52,521 --> 00:59:54,950
they're going to need a lot of weapons
systems. They're not going to need them,

1052
00:59:54,951 --> 00:59:57,230
but we can sell them to them.
It's an amazing thing to the,

1053
00:59:57,231 --> 01:00:02,231
once that money starts coming in and
coming in and just billion dollar look

1054
01:00:02,391 --> 01:00:04,340
contract after billion dollar contract,

1055
01:00:04,341 --> 01:00:07,100
I mean the amount of money is
defense contractors, Halliburton,

1056
01:00:07,101 --> 01:00:10,100
the clean up people, all the different
people in the amount of monies. Insane.

1057
01:00:10,610 --> 01:00:14,450
Try asking them to cut it off. How about
this? Well, not only that, $11 billion,

1058
01:00:14,451 --> 01:00:17,120
we have an $11 billion arms
deal with Iraq right now, okay?

1059
01:00:17,330 --> 01:00:19,190
And it's about to go through it.
But here's the thing,

1060
01:00:19,550 --> 01:00:23,640
can't give around the arms because Maliki
is not not agreeing to the terms heat

1061
01:00:23,650 --> 01:00:24,471
we set for him,

1062
01:00:24,471 --> 01:00:28,160
which was you have to share power with
the Sunni's because we don't want a civil

1063
01:00:28,161 --> 01:00:31,610
war there. And we have a lot of American
interests already in Iraq and Iraq, okay?

1064
01:00:31,611 --> 01:00:34,860
There's a lot of American companies
making money. Now here's the thing, you,

1065
01:00:34,970 --> 01:00:39,350
you tell a politician to veto that 11
million on dollar arms deal. You now,

1066
01:00:39,351 --> 01:00:42,110
how many people that employees, you
know, how many people that, that, that,

1067
01:00:42,111 --> 01:00:45,590
that you know, how many
constituents are fucking, um, uh,

1068
01:00:45,591 --> 01:00:49,130
our voting based on the fact that they
get a job because of leaven. Bill,

1069
01:00:49,250 --> 01:00:52,490
you're going to take $11 billion out
of the American economy. Good luck.

1070
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:56,930
Good fucking luck. And that's
what happens. Isn't that
amazing? It's amazing money,

1071
01:00:57,080 --> 01:01:01,670
but the money to make shit that
kills people unnecessarily. Yeah. Oh,

1072
01:01:01,671 --> 01:01:03,770
we need $11 billion.
We're going to give you 11 million now.

1073
01:01:03,771 --> 01:01:06,170
It's owned by the way, we're going to get
that to you and Maliki. So you can see,

1074
01:01:06,171 --> 01:01:09,530
you can create your own army of
Shia to keep the Sunni's down.

1075
01:01:09,740 --> 01:01:13,730
And that's called the civil war.
Without the military industrial complex,

1076
01:01:13,731 --> 01:01:18,500
how much less war would there be? I
don't know the answer. I don't know.

1077
01:01:19,230 --> 01:01:23,420
I don't, I don't think it's war that you
would stop. But I do think if you take,

1078
01:01:23,740 --> 01:01:25,580
I think I do think with, with, with,

1079
01:01:25,810 --> 01:01:30,350
well I think the private sector makes a
lot of money off of the decisions made

1080
01:01:30,351 --> 01:01:34,430
in government. And so there is
a profit to be made from war.

1081
01:01:34,610 --> 01:01:37,340
And if that's the case,
it does raise an important question.

1082
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:42,200
How if war becomes big business?
Uh, let me give you another example.

1083
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:47,110
A Iran. Iran has nuclear program. At
least we're trying to stop, right? Uh,

1084
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:52,120
we did sell bunker buster bombs to
Israel about three years ago now.

1085
01:01:52,820 --> 01:01:54,800
Now what?
Our bunker buster bombs,

1086
01:01:54,830 --> 01:01:59,830
bunker buster bombs and these particular
ones we sold to Israel are bombs that

1087
01:01:59,901 --> 01:02:03,500
can penetrate deep into the
earth and take out on arsenal.

1088
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:08,790
So if you have an, uh,
uh, nuclear, um, uh,

1089
01:02:09,080 --> 01:02:11,390
facility that is churning out weapons,

1090
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:15,180
these bunker bombs supposed to go into
the earth and blow that fucking facility

1091
01:02:15,181 --> 01:02:20,160
to smithereens. Okay. Now we don't
want to do it, but maybe Israel will,

1092
01:02:20,190 --> 01:02:24,030
we'll drop those bombs on aunt cause
they know where Iran is making these

1093
01:02:24,031 --> 01:02:25,790
weapons.
I uh,

1094
01:02:25,820 --> 01:02:29,580
do you think that the Americans are
sitting back and using the Israelis as a

1095
01:02:29,581 --> 01:02:33,320
proxy to see if those fucking
bunker buster bombs work? Uh,

1096
01:02:33,630 --> 01:02:37,350
there seems to be a lot of noise
headed Iran way. It seems to me.

1097
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:39,330
There seems to be
something brewing in Iran.

1098
01:02:39,630 --> 01:02:44,550
They have taken a very aggressive
stance with the, uh, with the, the golf,

1099
01:02:44,551 --> 01:02:48,060
with, with blocking
off, um, oil routes now.

1100
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:50,790
And the U s navy is saying
this is unacceptable.

1101
01:02:50,791 --> 01:02:55,440
There's a whole bunch of noise going on
and it seems to me things are moving in,

1102
01:02:55,441 --> 01:02:55,861
in a,

1103
01:02:55,861 --> 01:03:00,120
in a direction that is not an Iran is
favor and let's see what happens next.

1104
01:03:00,180 --> 01:03:03,420
But a lot of money, a lot
of money is real. You know,

1105
01:03:03,421 --> 01:03:07,830
we probably gave those those weapons
Israel without, with, for, for no pay,

1106
01:03:08,190 --> 01:03:11,250
but we want to see if they
work. You know, Wesley Clark,

1107
01:03:11,251 --> 01:03:14,300
the guy ran for president
predicted all this shit. Yeah.

1108
01:03:14,370 --> 01:03:16,980
Predicted every single stone. He
lives it every day. It's amazing.

1109
01:03:17,010 --> 01:03:18,570
He sees the fucking waste.
Yeah.

1110
01:03:18,630 --> 01:03:22,950
He sees how much money and
what kind of a lobbying,

1111
01:03:23,270 --> 01:03:27,600
uh, power, Raytheon and
Boeing and Lockheed are.

1112
01:03:27,750 --> 01:03:31,180
You don't think they have
massive lobbying efforts. Uh,

1113
01:03:31,210 --> 01:03:36,210
there's just too much money at stake
and they can find a way to justify it is

1114
01:03:37,081 --> 01:03:39,570
legal. Yeah. You know,
has been done employment.

1115
01:03:39,840 --> 01:03:43,860
I'll employ 10,000 people in your
state cause I'll take my thing,

1116
01:03:43,890 --> 01:03:47,790
but we got to build this. We've got to
build these very important, um, you know,

1117
01:03:47,791 --> 01:03:51,750
fucking [inaudible]. These are
all, this is all shocking shit.

1118
01:03:51,780 --> 01:03:55,620
It's all big bummer. End of the
world. Shit, how do you fix it?

1119
01:03:56,340 --> 01:03:59,820
Is there a way, is there a way
to fix? I will. I will tell you,

1120
01:03:59,821 --> 01:04:01,740
I'll tell you what Ron Paul would say.
I'll just,

1121
01:04:01,770 --> 01:04:04,140
I'll tell you what Ron Paul would say.
Ron Paul would say,

1122
01:04:05,010 --> 01:04:10,010
the only way to fix it is to make the
government the government that everybody

1123
01:04:11,281 --> 01:04:12,270
feeds off of.

1124
01:04:12,510 --> 01:04:15,270
And it has a lot of power to make these
decisions that you make the government

1125
01:04:15,271 --> 01:04:19,530
smaller. You take away some of
government's power and that's his NFU.

1126
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:20,220
And there's a,
there's,

1127
01:04:20,220 --> 01:04:24,570
I just watched a speech by Ronald Reagan
that he made it and I think 1969 and

1128
01:04:24,571 --> 01:04:28,830
it's called a time to choose.
And if he made that speech today,

1129
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:33,120
Ron Paul, Ron Paul could make that
speech today. And, and it would,

1130
01:04:33,180 --> 01:04:34,950
it wouldn't be any different at all.

1131
01:04:34,980 --> 01:04:39,180
He talks about how 37 cents of your dollar
is gone to the government before you

1132
01:04:39,181 --> 01:04:42,540
even wake up in the morning. 37% of
your day is working for the government.

1133
01:04:42,810 --> 01:04:44,220
And the government keeps getting
bigger and getting better.

1134
01:04:44,221 --> 01:04:47,390
He talks about the war on poverty and
if he say he did a little arithmetic,

1135
01:04:47,460 --> 01:04:47,850
it goes,

1136
01:04:47,850 --> 01:04:51,330
if we take the money that we spend on
poverty and he takes a list of how many

1137
01:04:51,550 --> 01:04:55,780
poor people that are, he said everybody
should be getting $4,600 a, um,

1138
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,680
a year.
But it turns out we're getting $600.

1139
01:04:58,681 --> 01:05:00,780
How that happened is some
money being lost along the way.

1140
01:05:00,781 --> 01:05:04,680
It was all the stuff that wrong. Let's
just go, let's explore that, right? Okay,

1141
01:05:04,681 --> 01:05:09,150
here's the deal. What if you do make
the government smaller? What do you,

1142
01:05:09,210 --> 01:05:10,560
how do you,
how much do you keep?

1143
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:13,740
And then what happens to all those people
that used to be government employees

1144
01:05:13,741 --> 01:05:16,500
that have a career in
being government employees?

1145
01:05:16,510 --> 01:05:18,820
Is that this the biggest problem?
And by the way,

1146
01:05:18,821 --> 01:05:21,160
I mean some of those folks are
hard working folks and you know,

1147
01:05:21,161 --> 01:05:24,940
they do a great service to the country
and some of those folks are useless and

1148
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:29,710
there's a lot of people that are a
little leeches unto a sister. Me, yes.

1149
01:05:29,711 --> 01:05:33,430
And for me it doesn't have to do with
being Republican, Democrat, conservative,

1150
01:05:33,431 --> 01:05:36,130
liberal. It has nothing to do that
for me. What, what I look at it as,

1151
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:40,360
as anything big at whether it's a
big corporation or the government,

1152
01:05:40,361 --> 01:05:42,190
which has no accountability
and is that big.

1153
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:46,360
I don't understand how you can make that,
that power run efficiently.

1154
01:05:46,361 --> 01:05:50,650
I do see how it can grow and it
keeps growing and that's the threat.

1155
01:05:50,651 --> 01:05:54,640
And like you just said, you just brought
up the biggest question. What happens?

1156
01:05:54,641 --> 01:05:56,140
How do you make government smaller?

1157
01:05:56,440 --> 01:05:59,500
It has so many vested
interests and not only that,

1158
01:05:59,530 --> 01:06:01,300
it's not just government computerize.

1159
01:06:01,410 --> 01:06:04,270
Privates private industry is
involved in this. You're right,

1160
01:06:04,600 --> 01:06:06,850
technology computers is the right answer.

1161
01:06:06,851 --> 01:06:11,230
Instead of having some asshole fucking
suit that represents your state, you know,

1162
01:06:11,260 --> 01:06:14,530
go up in front of everybody and
no misstate everyone's position.

1163
01:06:14,770 --> 01:06:19,120
Instead of having that you could have
the people actually let me say it,

1164
01:06:19,121 --> 01:06:22,990
they'll actually let me say one
other thing. You're not alone.

1165
01:06:22,991 --> 01:06:25,720
You're not alone in your thinking and
what the conversation we're having is

1166
01:06:25,721 --> 01:06:26,890
being had all over the country,

1167
01:06:27,310 --> 01:06:32,310
both Democrat and Republican circles and
that this whole Wall Street occupy Wall

1168
01:06:32,891 --> 01:06:36,170
Street movement is, is,
is in some ways, uh,

1169
01:06:36,220 --> 01:06:38,320
voicing some of those frustrations.

1170
01:06:39,130 --> 01:06:42,220
W what w I'll give you a piece
of good news in my opinion. Okay.

1171
01:06:42,520 --> 01:06:45,850
And a piece of good news that
we've never experienced before. Um,

1172
01:06:45,940 --> 01:06:50,200
you hear a lot of people talking about
inequality. Income, okay. And there is,

1173
01:06:50,560 --> 01:06:54,010
however there is, we
are, we are experiencing,

1174
01:06:54,011 --> 01:06:56,470
and I'm stealing this from a
Wall Street Journal article,

1175
01:06:56,471 --> 01:06:57,700
so I'm paraphrasing this,

1176
01:06:57,940 --> 01:07:02,080
but there is an equality of consumption
that we've never experienced before.

1177
01:07:02,080 --> 01:07:03,610
And let me give,
let me tell you what I mean by that.

1178
01:07:03,820 --> 01:07:06,130
Take somebody who's very wealthy,
very wealthy.

1179
01:07:06,430 --> 01:07:08,860
You have a lot more money than I do. I
do pretty well, but you got a moment.

1180
01:07:09,250 --> 01:07:13,150
Your life, your life and my
life are very, are very similar.

1181
01:07:13,151 --> 01:07:17,620
The only difference might be might
be that you drive a faster car,

1182
01:07:17,621 --> 01:07:21,970
but we sit in the same traffic. You
drive a Porsche. I drive a Prius,

1183
01:07:21,971 --> 01:07:25,030
but we basically sit in the same traffic.
But the interior of my car,

1184
01:07:25,060 --> 01:07:29,320
not that much different. I got gps, I got
a great stereo, I got everything I need.

1185
01:07:29,580 --> 01:07:31,840
The the,
you wear the same clothing I do.

1186
01:07:31,841 --> 01:07:35,380
I guess you could wear Armani and Versace.
You never would. And the rest of that,

1187
01:07:35,381 --> 01:07:39,790
it's fluff. We eat the same amount of
food. And if you look at most people,

1188
01:07:39,791 --> 01:07:41,290
and I'm talking about the
middle class in this country,

1189
01:07:41,291 --> 01:07:45,610
including people who are struggling
for money and stuff, most people,

1190
01:07:45,611 --> 01:07:49,240
the average amount of for a wedding
spent in this country is somewhere around

1191
01:07:49,241 --> 01:07:52,960
$26,000 a year.
I'm $26,000 that's a lot of money.

1192
01:07:53,230 --> 01:07:54,310
So what we are doing,

1193
01:07:54,311 --> 01:07:58,090
what we have now as an economy where
very rich people invent something.

1194
01:07:58,091 --> 01:08:01,840
Say it's an application or a computer or
something that we all we all use. Okay.

1195
01:08:02,410 --> 01:08:05,860
But they don't make any money unless they
can generate mass consumption of that

1196
01:08:05,861 --> 01:08:10,000
product so that most of us own a computer.

1197
01:08:10,150 --> 01:08:14,230
Most of us own a cell phone, and that
cell phone has all kinds of applications.

1198
01:08:14,260 --> 01:08:17,430
Most of us have a TV that brings to that,

1199
01:08:17,440 --> 01:08:19,400
that allows us to watch
pretty much anything we want.

1200
01:08:19,401 --> 01:08:24,170
High def TVs cost $700 of the
technology that you have in your phone.

1201
01:08:24,410 --> 01:08:27,500
Let's take the old Wall Street, the
first Wall Street with Michael Douglas.

1202
01:08:27,590 --> 01:08:28,580
He pulls out,

1203
01:08:28,850 --> 01:08:33,850
he pulls out a Motorola phone that weighs
two pounds and cost $3,995 back then.

1204
01:08:34,460 --> 01:08:35,420
Okay.
And it was,

1205
01:08:35,570 --> 01:08:39,680
it was a brick and weighed two pounds
and that was for the illegal is a little

1206
01:08:39,681 --> 01:08:43,220
more than that actually,
but that was for the elite back then.

1207
01:08:43,220 --> 01:08:47,450
That was what Michael Douglas pulls
out a cell phone and we go, Holy Shit.

1208
01:08:47,540 --> 01:08:51,620
He carries his own phone now a days.
The difference between,

1209
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:56,480
I'll tell you Steven jobs and I use
the same fucking phone, Warren Buffet,

1210
01:08:56,481 --> 01:08:59,870
and I use the same foam, right? The only
difference in Warren Buffett and me,

1211
01:08:59,871 --> 01:09:01,940
the only difference is he flies privately.

1212
01:09:02,030 --> 01:09:05,270
But I can fly anywhere I want for under
a thousand dollars anywhere in the world.

1213
01:09:05,271 --> 01:09:07,580
If I, if I, if I get on
the Internet fast enough.

1214
01:09:07,820 --> 01:09:10,010
So we have an equality of
consumption in this country,

1215
01:09:10,700 --> 01:09:14,240
unlike any time in the history of the
world. And that's good fucking news.

1216
01:09:14,690 --> 01:09:18,410
Most people I'm talking about,
most people at least have enough to eat.

1217
01:09:18,800 --> 01:09:20,570
They have an ability
to contact each other.

1218
01:09:20,600 --> 01:09:23,180
They have an ability to entertain
themselves almost the way they want.

1219
01:09:23,181 --> 01:09:26,930
How many people own Xboxes?
I believe it was last year,

1220
01:09:26,931 --> 01:09:31,850
60 million were sold or something crazy
as Xboxes. So think about that. Yeah.

1221
01:09:31,880 --> 01:09:36,770
So, so, so we have access and we have
access to information and inspiration.

1222
01:09:36,980 --> 01:09:39,110
How many people listen to your podcasts?
You don't have a lot of money,

1223
01:09:39,290 --> 01:09:43,190
but they get inspired that you turn them
on to things that they can afford. Uh,

1224
01:09:43,220 --> 01:09:46,910
you, you, you know, this is what's, this
is what the good news is about. Yes,

1225
01:09:46,911 --> 01:09:49,700
we may have inequality of income,

1226
01:09:49,701 --> 01:09:52,670
but we have equality of consumption
like we'd never seen before and that's

1227
01:09:52,700 --> 01:09:55,700
fucking, that's a big deal.
And nobody talks about that.

1228
01:09:56,330 --> 01:10:01,190
This definitely isn't the worst
time in human history. The great,

1229
01:10:01,370 --> 01:10:05,960
the thing I think what would really
is killing people is the unrealized

1230
01:10:05,961 --> 01:10:09,320
potential of the human race. That's what
drives people nuts. People that really,

1231
01:10:09,321 --> 01:10:11,390
truly are patriotic people that really,

1232
01:10:11,391 --> 01:10:15,950
truly do have respect and
admiration for the human spirit.

1233
01:10:15,980 --> 01:10:19,700
They believed that there's a much higher
level that our society and our culture

1234
01:10:19,701 --> 01:10:24,080
can achieve. And I do too. It's
not that I'm an unpatriotic,

1235
01:10:24,410 --> 01:10:27,470
it's just that I think, God damn, we
could do a lot fucking better than this.

1236
01:10:27,471 --> 01:10:30,920
We don't have to be the crux of the
world. It's not necessary. We can,

1237
01:10:30,940 --> 01:10:32,750
we were going to die some day.

1238
01:10:32,870 --> 01:10:36,650
We are temporary beings the way
we're doing this is ridiculous.

1239
01:10:36,740 --> 01:10:40,310
The fact that we've allowed these people
to continue to operate like this is

1240
01:10:40,370 --> 01:10:43,130
ridiculous.
They're not looking out for our needs.

1241
01:10:43,250 --> 01:10:45,710
We shouldn't be playing
police all over the world.

1242
01:10:45,830 --> 01:10:49,390
We should have a hundred fucking military
basis over the world. It's ridiculous.

1243
01:10:49,880 --> 01:10:54,050
Our military industrial complex as
somehow or another co-opted the entire

1244
01:10:54,051 --> 01:10:57,830
government and they're forcing people
into some shifted. The people don't want,

1245
01:10:57,920 --> 01:10:59,960
even the patriotic people don't.

1246
01:11:01,040 --> 01:11:04,820
Very few people think it's a good idea
that we stick around and Afghanistan,

1247
01:11:05,060 --> 01:11:07,910
I mean Afghanistan doesn't even need is
we overthrew the government. I wreck.

1248
01:11:07,911 --> 01:11:11,630
We took off and left them
in chaos obviously. Right?

1249
01:11:11,631 --> 01:11:14,160
Everything's fucking falling
apart over there and guess what?

1250
01:11:14,730 --> 01:11:18,840
Afghanistan doesn't have a government,
right? They're not even a real country.

1251
01:11:19,740 --> 01:11:21,760
It's ridiculous.
The idea that we can't leave it on.

1252
01:11:21,790 --> 01:11:23,940
We don't want that to happen
over here. My, my buddy,

1253
01:11:23,941 --> 01:11:25,740
the other guy was a CIA guy said to me,
he said,

1254
01:11:25,741 --> 01:11:29,280
he said when he spent a lot of time in
Afghanistan and he said they were talking

1255
01:11:29,281 --> 01:11:34,281
to a dude on the border of Pakistan
and a of Afghanistan was Xerostomia.

1256
01:11:34,501 --> 01:11:38,140
That lawless area. The guy didn't know
what Pakistan was. He never, he was on,

1257
01:11:38,170 --> 01:11:40,380
he lived on the mountain. He was like,
what are you talking about? I don't,

1258
01:11:40,410 --> 01:11:42,720
that's not my reality. I, and you want,

1259
01:11:42,721 --> 01:11:45,510
you want a guy in counter hard to have
loyalty to add somebody to the government

1260
01:11:45,511 --> 01:11:48,390
in Kabul. There's never been
a tradition of that. Never.

1261
01:11:48,540 --> 01:11:50,970
So what are you talking about?
The just war lords, by the way,

1262
01:11:50,971 --> 01:11:54,270
I drunk a corrupt government like you
think Karzai and his group are, are,

1263
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:58,110
are looking out for all the [inaudible]
and the touchy acts up in the north.

1264
01:11:58,111 --> 01:12:01,950
The fuck you [inaudible]
brother who was a CIA drug.

1265
01:12:02,310 --> 01:12:06,670
A drug runner. Yeah. Drug runners
slash getting checks from the CS. What?

1266
01:12:06,690 --> 01:12:09,780
They're having a tough time
getting people to not grow poppies.

1267
01:12:09,800 --> 01:12:11,610
Oopsie for heroin. We'd rather, you know,

1268
01:12:11,670 --> 01:12:15,960
grow cotton and soybean because it's a
lot more profitable. It's, it's, it's,

1269
01:12:15,990 --> 01:12:18,780
these are, these are a lot of
those soldiers. I was out there,

1270
01:12:18,781 --> 01:12:20,550
I was out there and
those fucking soldiers,

1271
01:12:20,820 --> 01:12:25,140
those soldiers that were
building hospitals and schools
and those guys are brave.

1272
01:12:25,141 --> 01:12:27,750
And I fucking him proud where
every time I see those guys okay.

1273
01:12:27,930 --> 01:12:30,810
And a lot of them died and a lot of
them got fucking grievously a grievously

1274
01:12:30,811 --> 01:12:34,020
wounded. Is that a word? It doesn't
matter. So, so, so the, the,

1275
01:12:34,021 --> 01:12:36,480
the bottom line is I'm not,
I'm not, uh, that's what,

1276
01:12:36,510 --> 01:12:40,470
that's what kills me is that effort
and that fucking dozers, real heroes.

1277
01:12:40,530 --> 01:12:42,630
You'll fucking men and women
up there with it. Yeah.

1278
01:12:42,930 --> 01:12:45,300
And then we go out there and anybody,

1279
01:12:45,301 --> 01:12:47,880
you can tell anybody you talked to anybody
who really knows about the country,

1280
01:12:47,910 --> 01:12:51,000
including those soldiers who've
been there a long time ago.

1281
01:12:51,150 --> 01:12:56,100
What the fuck are we doing, man? You
can't build us is going to build a nation,

1282
01:12:56,550 --> 01:12:59,370
Afghanistan. And you're going to build
a nation where there never was one.

1283
01:12:59,371 --> 01:13:00,390
What are you talking about?

1284
01:13:00,900 --> 01:13:03,870
All you're doing is taking money and
moving it to people with bigger guns.

1285
01:13:04,520 --> 01:13:09,520
What is the deal with al Qaeda in
Afghanistan isn't there's like almost none

1286
01:13:10,201 --> 01:13:14,070
left. No, there's no awkward. No Al Qaeda.
And by the way, you think the Afghanis,

1287
01:13:14,130 --> 01:13:17,130
but there is a Taliban. It tell,
you know what Taliban button means.

1288
01:13:17,330 --> 01:13:21,360
Tell means student. Really? Yes.
So you're a student. So tally bond.

1289
01:13:21,470 --> 01:13:25,860
She has say is you're telling about I
tally bond means yes, I'm a stew. Yeah,

1290
01:13:25,861 --> 01:13:30,100
you're here. You're a student students.
Yes. Italian. You know, you're, you're,

1291
01:13:30,120 --> 01:13:34,820
and you're a student. So you know,
then that why? Because the, the,

1292
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:39,050
the notion came out of those schools and
put shower and in Saudi Arabia, most of,

1293
01:13:39,090 --> 01:13:40,410
oh,
most of those schools,

1294
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:45,560
all of those schools in the shower
and came out at were financed by Saudi

1295
01:13:46,410 --> 01:13:50,220
Arabia. Our number one ally in the Middle
East. Okay. They were financed by that.

1296
01:13:50,250 --> 01:13:52,440
Why? The Saudis are what? Hobbies.

1297
01:13:52,590 --> 01:13:56,250
That is a puritanical sect of Sunni Islam.
Okay.

1298
01:13:56,340 --> 01:14:01,160
Obsessed with purity. Okay,
so let's start there. Uh,

1299
01:14:01,350 --> 01:14:04,620
that's what happened and you have to go
all the way back to when that Soviets

1300
01:14:04,621 --> 01:14:07,650
actually invaded Afghanistan and we were
financing the Mujahideen and everything

1301
01:14:07,651 --> 01:14:11,380
else with the help of the Isi, which
is the music truths. You would be,

1302
01:14:11,381 --> 01:14:12,040
the growth got

1303
01:14:12,040 --> 01:14:15,130
to ask about this because I watched it
in a documentary where they were saying

1304
01:14:15,131 --> 01:14:15,671
that the,

1305
01:14:15,671 --> 01:14:20,671
the whole term for jihad was originally
a war on your own vices and that it was

1306
01:14:21,851 --> 01:14:26,470
subverted by the CIA. The root word,
if you had an Arabic is struggle,

1307
01:14:26,740 --> 01:14:31,210
struggle and struggle. You had meant
she had meant two things. I look,

1308
01:14:31,211 --> 01:14:35,830
I said that was very sad. She had very
authentic. It's so authentic. I love you.

1309
01:14:36,130 --> 01:14:38,800
And the idea behind it of
course, was the, was the,

1310
01:14:38,830 --> 01:14:42,460
with the battle that always wages between
the flesh and the spirit in your own

1311
01:14:42,461 --> 01:14:42,970
heart.

1312
01:14:42,970 --> 01:14:47,830
And then when the CIA was training the
Mujahideen and supplying them with arms,

1313
01:14:47,831 --> 01:14:52,831
they somehow or another subvert it
to get them to meet the who did it,

1314
01:14:53,860 --> 01:14:57,520
who got them to change it to holy war.
What happened was when,

1315
01:14:57,521 --> 01:15:02,140
when you had people who were fighting,
first of all, what the Soviets did too.

1316
01:15:02,230 --> 01:15:05,320
I've gotten some, it's pretty horrific,
right? Cut Out, cut down all the trees,

1317
01:15:05,321 --> 01:15:08,860
bombed all kinds of villages. And
you had these, you created fanatics.

1318
01:15:08,861 --> 01:15:12,040
You created men who,
who basically had lost their village,

1319
01:15:12,250 --> 01:15:15,760
gotten and they're young men and
basically looking for natural gas.

1320
01:15:15,761 --> 01:15:19,210
Is that what they're looking for?
We're just looking for a buffer.

1321
01:15:19,211 --> 01:15:22,000
They were looking for a um, uh, they were,

1322
01:15:22,360 --> 01:15:27,360
I believe they were looking essentially
for a buffer zone between Pakistan and

1323
01:15:28,900 --> 01:15:31,750
and themselves. Oh,
okay. That makes sense.

1324
01:15:32,020 --> 01:15:35,500
It was all just all due to
the Cold War and, and um,

1325
01:15:35,560 --> 01:15:38,230
and they were afraid they were going
to lose control of Afghanistan.

1326
01:15:39,220 --> 01:15:42,190
Never really had nobody ever
wanted to be in Afghanistan.

1327
01:15:42,191 --> 01:15:44,440
You didn't want to be living in the
Khyber Pass. It's too forbidding.

1328
01:15:44,441 --> 01:15:47,920
There wasn't oil there. They say
there's minerals there. Good luck.

1329
01:15:47,921 --> 01:15:49,660
Nobody fucking wants the
minerals that we don't have.

1330
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:52,630
We get what we get plenty of minerals
from Africa and places that are much

1331
01:15:52,631 --> 01:15:54,310
easier and nobody wants
to go into Afghanistan.

1332
01:15:54,520 --> 01:15:56,440
It's always been a group of unruly.

1333
01:15:56,830 --> 01:15:59,140
You still not totally
true because of the one,

1334
01:15:59,170 --> 01:16:03,180
there's a lot of people that he had
the resources to top those. Yeah,

1335
01:16:03,260 --> 01:16:07,390
but nobody wanted to get involved.
It's just back then in [inaudible] 79,

1336
01:16:07,391 --> 01:16:10,090
when they [inaudible] Steve
is just fucking too difficult.

1337
01:16:10,120 --> 01:16:14,080
They didn't understand that nobody ever
anticipated the worth of the minerals

1338
01:16:14,081 --> 01:16:17,620
though the crew for cell phones, you
know, like lithium ion for batteries.

1339
01:16:17,720 --> 01:16:19,290
This is one of the the best,
uh,

1340
01:16:19,330 --> 01:16:22,600
mining areas in the world for all
these different, I don't know,

1341
01:16:22,690 --> 01:16:26,200
it's all over all these different
scientific journals. I mean,

1342
01:16:26,201 --> 01:16:28,780
they found over $1 trillion worth
of minerals and Afghanistan.

1343
01:16:28,840 --> 01:16:33,070
We'll see if anybody is willing
to put the money into that.

1344
01:16:33,071 --> 01:16:35,710
It's such a fucking pain in the ass to it.

1345
01:16:35,710 --> 01:16:37,780
I can't understand why you
would say that there's,

1346
01:16:37,781 --> 01:16:40,110
there's $1 trillion laying in the ground.
You,

1347
01:16:40,120 --> 01:16:42,700
you're telling me that it's not going
to be big businesses going to pull that

1348
01:16:42,701 --> 01:16:44,740
out of there $1 trillion oil.

1349
01:16:44,860 --> 01:16:47,740
Do the trillion dollars can
change the fucking world.

1350
01:16:47,770 --> 01:16:51,610
$1 trillion couldn't put a company into,
I'm a senior out of a position of power.

1351
01:16:51,820 --> 01:16:54,400
You should research it before we talk
any further. I don't know. I don't know.

1352
01:16:55,180 --> 01:16:56,020
It's indisputable.

1353
01:16:56,050 --> 01:16:59,530
They found a gigantic or of minerals
they had always suspected, but it's much,

1354
01:16:59,531 --> 01:17:02,320
much larger than they thought. I don't
believe that we went into Afghanistan.

1355
01:17:02,321 --> 01:17:04,560
I think we went into counseling
because they were harboring al Qaeda.

1356
01:17:04,570 --> 01:17:07,180
I think that's what it was very
hard to get it politically.

1357
01:17:07,480 --> 01:17:09,920
You can't get the American public
that you say the American public,

1358
01:17:09,921 --> 01:17:13,970
hey we got minerals, we've got everybody
wants it to be either or, you know,

1359
01:17:13,971 --> 01:17:16,640
all we went into there because were
corrupt and we're trying to take all their

1360
01:17:16,641 --> 01:17:19,890
poppies cause it's not billions
dollars with a heroin. No, it's easy.

1361
01:17:19,930 --> 01:17:24,110
It's not an either or. It's a god
damn soup of Shit. And by the way,

1362
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:27,260
it doesn't hurt that they could make
money off the poppy. So it doesn't hurt.

1363
01:17:27,320 --> 01:17:28,840
There's $1 trillion worth of minerals.
It doesn't,

1364
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:32,790
we should try to predict the next six
out there. There's opportunity. Right.

1365
01:17:32,940 --> 01:17:36,860
But isn't it funny how everybody
wants to have a black or white issue?

1366
01:17:36,861 --> 01:17:39,710
It's either a crazy conspiracy
theory that's, or you know,

1367
01:17:39,711 --> 01:17:42,560
this is just the unfortunate
nature of reality. That's movies.

1368
01:17:42,590 --> 01:17:46,310
That's what we want. We want, they're
so fucking stupid. It's so amazing.

1369
01:17:46,580 --> 01:17:49,130
It's way sloppier. Real life is
waste sloppier. You know when you,

1370
01:17:49,131 --> 01:17:52,100
when you talk to, I think it was Tony Snow
before he died, said they were saying,

1371
01:17:52,130 --> 01:17:54,350
well what are you guys gonna do
about this situation? He said, guys,

1372
01:17:54,410 --> 01:17:57,290
when we're in the Oval Office and you've
got a bunch of people there with all

1373
01:17:57,291 --> 01:17:59,800
the top brass in the military
and the CIA and then you've got,

1374
01:18:00,060 --> 01:18:02,900
you know the State Department,
we do exactly what you think we do.

1375
01:18:03,110 --> 01:18:05,330
Try sitting in a room with 10 we strike,

1376
01:18:05,331 --> 01:18:07,730
try sitting in a room of 30
people and come up with one,

1377
01:18:07,790 --> 01:18:11,000
one idea to try to come up with one
thing everybody agrees on you don't

1378
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:14,540
everybody's banding ideas back and forth.
People are disagreeing with each other.

1379
01:18:14,541 --> 01:18:16,160
People are pissed off cause they you over,

1380
01:18:16,161 --> 01:18:20,750
you talked over me so nobody can get the
presidents here and that's what happens.

1381
01:18:20,751 --> 01:18:23,330
And then the president has to go into a
room with three of his advisors and have

1382
01:18:23,340 --> 01:18:26,180
to fucking go. We got seven options
that we'd been presented. No.

1383
01:18:26,181 --> 01:18:30,690
Why do you think that in that case, why
do you think that Obama is like such a,

1384
01:18:30,691 --> 01:18:32,570
a wishy washy dude?

1385
01:18:32,571 --> 01:18:36,440
Why do you think he's the guy that
is willing to pass the NDA bill?

1386
01:18:36,620 --> 01:18:41,120
He's the guy that is, I think
my, my feeling and I don't know,

1387
01:18:41,150 --> 01:18:45,190
but my feeling is in the mistake
Obama made and I think the,

1388
01:18:45,191 --> 01:18:49,760
the opportunity he wasted was not,
not, I think he's an academic,

1389
01:18:49,820 --> 01:18:54,800
first of all. And I think he's
by nature a very, very, um,

1390
01:18:55,370 --> 01:18:56,330
uh, he's, uh, he's, uh,

1391
01:18:56,420 --> 01:19:00,620
he's an intellectual and he looks at
both sides and I think he's by nature

1392
01:19:00,621 --> 01:19:05,450
fairly indecisive maybe because he's an
intellectual and I think, I think so.

1393
01:19:05,451 --> 01:19:08,900
I'm just, I'm just speaking,
he's compromised. I think
it's clearly compromised.

1394
01:19:09,050 --> 01:19:13,020
He doesn't have the, uh, I don't
think, I don't know. There's nothing I,

1395
01:19:13,021 --> 01:19:15,740
I don't necessarily agree that
he's that smart. And also,

1396
01:19:15,741 --> 01:19:18,110
I don't think that he has a,
the backbone. I don't think,

1397
01:19:19,320 --> 01:19:21,240
I don't think it's an effective
leader. I think that, uh,

1398
01:19:21,580 --> 01:19:24,320
he should be more convicted.
He should have stronger convictions.

1399
01:19:24,350 --> 01:19:26,990
He does have strong convictions
towards the people. Got them in power.

1400
01:19:26,991 --> 01:19:29,030
And that's what you've got to look at it.
If you guys look,

1401
01:19:29,031 --> 01:19:32,660
people spent a lot of money to get that
guy into the position that he's in and

1402
01:19:32,661 --> 01:19:36,620
he's working for them now. It's as
clear as day. Yeah, well they'll listen.

1403
01:19:36,621 --> 01:19:37,490
Let's let look at that.

1404
01:19:37,491 --> 01:19:41,180
I mean a president spends two years doing
as policy and then he spends the next

1405
01:19:41,180 --> 01:19:42,110
few years trying to get reelected.

1406
01:19:42,440 --> 01:19:46,220
It's just basically trying to keep
everybody reasonable. You know? It's like,

1407
01:19:46,221 --> 01:19:49,910
come on folks, let's just be reasonable
with how hard we fuck these people.

1408
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:51,860
I mean that's really where
the president's job is.

1409
01:19:52,010 --> 01:19:55,490
They get it and the best they can do
is say, I really don't agree with this,

1410
01:19:55,491 --> 01:19:58,130
but I have to sign it.
He voted against what he did with the NDA.

1411
01:19:58,131 --> 01:20:01,460
He voted against a rock and I,
and I always appreciate that you said,

1412
01:20:01,461 --> 01:20:03,750
I don't believe in going into Iraq.
Yeah.

1413
01:20:03,800 --> 01:20:07,980
But meanwhile here we are who we are.
A lot

1414
01:20:07,980 --> 01:20:11,310
of it's tough for a presence. Yeah.
It's tough. I don't know if it's read.

1415
01:20:11,320 --> 01:20:14,460
Do you think the problems,
how much say do you think he really has?

1416
01:20:14,461 --> 01:20:18,480
How much say do you, I mean,
is it possible for him to
go against those people?

1417
01:20:18,481 --> 01:20:22,740
Is it even possible? Can't do a thing
without congress. Right. So he has,

1418
01:20:22,830 --> 01:20:25,440
he has executive power,
but they used to be that way,

1419
01:20:25,650 --> 01:20:27,510
but you don't have to declare war anymore.

1420
01:20:27,630 --> 01:20:31,290
You just start going over places and next
thing you know, shit happens. I mean,

1421
01:20:31,440 --> 01:20:34,590
was war ever declared and it was there
a couple of conflicts that we were

1422
01:20:34,591 --> 01:20:39,330
involved in were congress did not step
in and declare war. Vietnam. Yeah,

1423
01:20:39,390 --> 01:20:43,100
there you go. I mean that's, it's not,
we don't necessarily know there's,

1424
01:20:43,101 --> 01:20:45,520
there's an emergency executive powers,
you know,

1425
01:20:45,720 --> 01:20:47,190
and then that's another creepy thing.

1426
01:20:47,191 --> 01:20:51,210
It's like when you find out how many
fucking bills and laws are passed just

1427
01:20:51,450 --> 01:20:55,560
under your nose. Congress passed flying
bombs passed 40,000 miles last year.

1428
01:20:58,530 --> 01:21:01,900
$40,000 Ladies and gentlemen, why
is that? Do you really meet them?

1429
01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:03,720
I believe that is the,
uh, that is the number.

1430
01:21:03,870 --> 01:21:07,910
What I say is that you need Clint
Eastwood laws and this sort sorta clinics

1431
01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:11,550
would laws. If you couldn't imagine
cleany Twitter arresting somebody for it,

1432
01:21:11,940 --> 01:21:14,950
then it should be common sense law.
It's fucking Clint Eastwood.

1433
01:21:15,170 --> 01:21:18,600
It's only assholes. Douchebags
meth heads guy who needs a punch.

1434
01:21:18,601 --> 01:21:21,240
Someone you have to shut but you gas laws.

1435
01:21:21,270 --> 01:21:25,830
But you get into really complicated
issues with, for example, antipiracy laws.

1436
01:21:25,920 --> 01:21:29,700
How far do you go with that stuff?
Right? So, so you know, you and I love,

1437
01:21:29,701 --> 01:21:33,660
we raging debate on my website about this
because we will, because the website,

1438
01:21:33,690 --> 01:21:37,230
because the web is the last frontier of
free speech of free everything and it's

1439
01:21:37,231 --> 01:21:40,070
not regulated.
Now my take on it though,

1440
01:21:40,200 --> 01:21:43,920
electrical property from being stolen
by countries like China. What do you do?

1441
01:21:43,921 --> 01:21:47,430
Do you pass a bunch of laws? Would that
help the problem? I don't think it would.

1442
01:21:47,460 --> 01:21:48,293
Well we would have,

1443
01:21:48,420 --> 01:21:51,020
we would have to step up and say
somehow or another we're going to,

1444
01:21:51,280 --> 01:21:54,570
we're going to boycott the, I
mean, they wouldn't eat you kill,

1445
01:21:54,571 --> 01:21:57,300
you couldn't boycott the whole country.
That'd be ridiculous.

1446
01:21:57,600 --> 01:22:00,690
You couldn't knew that.
You couldn't make a few people that won't,

1447
01:22:00,750 --> 01:22:03,630
won't play nice internationally
responsible for the whole country.

1448
01:22:03,990 --> 01:22:06,090
And what the fuck would you
do it, man? Well, you know,

1449
01:22:06,091 --> 01:22:10,050
we've got to do is somehow or another
get it into people's minds when they're

1450
01:22:10,051 --> 01:22:12,540
really, really young, really young,

1451
01:22:12,780 --> 01:22:17,340
that the world is so much better if you're
cool to people and then once they get

1452
01:22:17,341 --> 01:22:21,090
there, the mean it's spreading that Ma,
no, we haven't. Not only in other words,

1453
01:22:21,091 --> 01:22:22,970
in other words,
we haven't never will but what,

1454
01:22:22,980 --> 01:22:26,940
but here's the thing that's
not necessarily true because
we've never had access

1455
01:22:26,941 --> 01:22:27,750
to human beings.

1456
01:22:27,750 --> 01:22:32,750
The way we have access now
and the Internet and I think
that human beings to two

1457
01:22:33,751 --> 01:22:37,440
things happen. One, you develop
in a terrible environment and you,

1458
01:22:37,441 --> 01:22:41,010
you develop all these defense mechanisms
at genes that are only activated under

1459
01:22:41,011 --> 01:22:45,270
extreme stress and you need to develop
like a whole culture of people that are

1460
01:22:45,271 --> 01:22:48,930
in a bad situation on a regular
basis and are wired for that shit.

1461
01:22:49,110 --> 01:22:50,570
That's terrible. Okay. You,

1462
01:22:50,571 --> 01:22:54,150
you also develop a bunch of people
who don't get love on a regular basis.

1463
01:22:54,151 --> 01:22:54,990
They don't know how to give up.

1464
01:22:54,991 --> 01:22:58,320
They don't have a real true sense
of community if real problems,

1465
01:22:58,321 --> 01:23:01,140
if you don't educate people
and how to be a perception,

1466
01:23:01,320 --> 01:23:05,710
but once you do and once you can,
you can slowly change things.

1467
01:23:05,711 --> 01:23:07,750
You can change the way
children are raised,

1468
01:23:07,870 --> 01:23:11,260
you can change the way relationships
between your neighbors or form and you can

1469
01:23:11,261 --> 01:23:16,261
slowly spread this out to the point
where it can have a real effect.

1470
01:23:16,451 --> 01:23:20,120
You can essentially be a new
operating system for people.

1471
01:23:20,360 --> 01:23:22,180
Well, for the most part, I
got two thoughts on that.

1472
01:23:22,181 --> 01:23:25,750
One is if you read Tim Ferriss's book,
the four hour Workweek, not for our body,

1473
01:23:25,751 --> 01:23:26,540
but the four hour work week.

1474
01:23:26,540 --> 01:23:28,000
Listen man,
I ain't got no time.

1475
01:23:28,001 --> 01:23:32,530
I'm trying to get some four hour
bike season a hair and he's a really,

1476
01:23:32,531 --> 01:23:34,990
he's really a great author,
isn't he? I really love that.

1477
01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:37,710
Lot of that fascinating

1478
01:23:37,800 --> 01:23:39,620
poker and I love that.
I love the other one and he said,

1479
01:23:39,890 --> 01:23:44,180
and he said something and it goes to the
internet and stealing and things. Look,

1480
01:23:44,181 --> 01:23:46,130
he said you,
when you give people,

1481
01:23:46,310 --> 01:23:49,220
when you like what you doing here
with the brain thing, you say,

1482
01:23:49,310 --> 01:23:52,400
if you don't like it, I'm sending back
get, we'll give you your money back.

1483
01:23:52,580 --> 01:23:55,880
When you do something like from a business
plan and he talks about it, he says,

1484
01:23:56,150 --> 01:23:58,490
just tell people you'll give
them either you can give people,

1485
01:23:58,491 --> 01:24:01,520
you can tell people, you'll give them
double their money back and people go,

1486
01:24:01,521 --> 01:24:04,640
well that people will abuse it.
I'll, I'll go broke. Guess what?

1487
01:24:04,850 --> 01:24:09,850
About 2% of the people out there always
abuse it always and the rest of them

1488
01:24:10,191 --> 01:24:13,490
don't. And the bottom line is
it's like stealing music. Okay.

1489
01:24:13,730 --> 01:24:17,030
Once you started getting out there
to piracy is stealing. Most people,

1490
01:24:17,031 --> 01:24:20,390
and I don't steal fucking music.
Okay. Some people do, but I was like,

1491
01:24:20,391 --> 01:24:23,750
I'm an artist. I bout to come up
with my one hour special. I'm like,

1492
01:24:23,751 --> 01:24:26,030
I don't want people stealing it.
And it'd be nice if they paid for it.

1493
01:24:26,031 --> 01:24:29,390
I guess you, if I feel guilty, I feel
guilty because I listened to some,

1494
01:24:29,391 --> 01:24:31,760
somebody a great song and all
the effort that went into it.

1495
01:24:31,820 --> 01:24:36,140
I don't want to see like, and
actually most people, most
people don't steal music.

1496
01:24:36,141 --> 01:24:37,340
Most people go to Itunes,

1497
01:24:37,650 --> 01:24:42,220
they down to the 12 Shawnee five
cause they have no money. Sure.

1498
01:24:42,250 --> 01:24:44,860
But even that man,
even then if you look at the statistics,

1499
01:24:44,890 --> 01:24:49,270
even then if you look at this disease,
I my Shitty,

1500
01:24:49,271 --> 01:24:52,360
I'm a shitty business person because
I don't think about business.

1501
01:24:52,361 --> 01:24:53,320
I try to think about it.

1502
01:24:53,321 --> 01:24:57,160
I want to think about business as little
as possible and if anybody's ever said

1503
01:24:57,161 --> 01:25:01,840
to me like, Hey, if I could get your
your DVD on torrent or should buy,

1504
01:25:01,841 --> 01:25:03,820
should I buy it? I'm
like, you know what man?

1505
01:25:03,821 --> 01:25:06,610
You should do whatever feels right to
you. That's what you should do. Okay.

1506
01:25:06,611 --> 01:25:08,500
If you don't want to pay for it,
don't pay for it.

1507
01:25:08,501 --> 01:25:12,580
If you feel like it's okay to take it,
just go ahead. I mean it's not, look,

1508
01:25:12,581 --> 01:25:13,390
I'm going to,

1509
01:25:13,390 --> 01:25:16,000
I'm going to put stuff out there and
I'm going to put it out there with the

1510
01:25:16,001 --> 01:25:17,950
honest intention of trying
to entertain people.

1511
01:25:18,070 --> 01:25:20,710
I'm going to say this is what the
fee is and if you pay it, you pay it.

1512
01:25:21,040 --> 01:25:23,980
And it would, Louis CK did is the perfect
thing where he released it himself.

1513
01:25:24,010 --> 01:25:27,160
Total direct connection between the
artist put it out for five bucks,

1514
01:25:27,161 --> 01:25:30,110
which is awesome. You know, it's
a perfect price and you know what?

1515
01:25:30,130 --> 01:25:33,040
I think that that's the future.
I think all these other relationships,

1516
01:25:33,041 --> 01:25:36,890
amazing books. I'm talking about exodus.
I downloaded for $7 and even Louis,

1517
01:25:36,910 --> 01:25:39,200
they pirated his thing even
though he said, you know,

1518
01:25:39,370 --> 01:25:41,560
he asked people not to steal it.
Don't put it up on Torrence,

1519
01:25:41,561 --> 01:25:43,030
but you're always to have
some people did that.

1520
01:25:43,031 --> 01:25:44,560
But there are always going to him.
But you know what man?

1521
01:25:44,680 --> 01:25:49,270
Some people don't have five bucks.
Okay. And I know it sounds stupid,

1522
01:25:49,271 --> 01:25:50,790
but you can't

1523
01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:55,760
unless you're starving because of all
this, you can't fixate on it. Those,

1524
01:25:55,780 --> 01:25:59,890
the correct thing to fixate on is get
out your point of view. And you know,

1525
01:25:59,891 --> 01:26:03,980
I look, I've been in a position
before where I was broke
and uh, unfortunately for

1526
01:26:03,980 --> 01:26:05,800
me there was no internet at
the time. Right. You know,

1527
01:26:05,810 --> 01:26:09,280
I didn't have the opportunity
to just download music, but
of course I would. Yeah.

1528
01:26:09,350 --> 01:26:11,270
When I had no money, I mean
what I'd be like, you know,

1529
01:26:11,271 --> 01:26:13,390
I would love to listen
to this led Zepplin over,

1530
01:26:13,410 --> 01:26:15,170
but it wouldn't be a good person.
You know,

1531
01:26:15,171 --> 01:26:17,600
when I would say I'm going to buy this
fucking thing someday when I have some

1532
01:26:17,601 --> 01:26:19,840
money, but right now I'm going to
download the shit out of this. Beautiful.

1533
01:26:19,910 --> 01:26:23,230
The way artists make money, they're still
making money. Yeah. They're not starving.

1534
01:26:23,480 --> 01:26:26,450
And by the way, it's beautiful
that all that shit gets out there.

1535
01:26:26,451 --> 01:26:29,540
I want everybody to download every fucking
led Zeppelin album that's ever made.

1536
01:26:29,720 --> 01:26:30,411
And if it's,
you know,

1537
01:26:30,411 --> 01:26:33,690
a dollar that you can't afford to
get fucking whole lot of love goes,

1538
01:26:33,700 --> 01:26:36,620
you'll find it somewhere man. But
he will. So listen to it on youtube.

1539
01:26:36,621 --> 01:26:39,480
This like things you can take where
you can take a song off youtube,

1540
01:26:39,510 --> 01:26:42,710
they'll convert it into an MP,
three 40 now credit card companies have,

1541
01:26:42,711 --> 01:26:44,330
I think it's setting a ceiling,

1542
01:26:45,050 --> 01:26:50,050
but credit card companies always have
what they factor in a certain fraud

1543
01:26:50,600 --> 01:26:54,260
quotient in their business plan.
And I think it's almost all,

1544
01:26:54,261 --> 01:26:57,230
it's really interesting because
actually like 2.2 or something,

1545
01:26:57,231 --> 01:26:58,790
it's almost always the same percentage.

1546
01:26:59,030 --> 01:27:02,780
2.2% of the population is going to defraud
you and you're going to lose money.

1547
01:27:02,960 --> 01:27:05,450
And they just factor that in.
There's always,

1548
01:27:05,560 --> 01:27:08,600
it's the same percentage that you were
talking about earlier with double your

1549
01:27:08,601 --> 01:27:12,250
money back guarantee, you know with
the, the Alpha brain supplements. Yeah.

1550
01:27:12,260 --> 01:27:13,640
If he did do that,
I bet you're right.

1551
01:27:13,641 --> 01:27:18,500
I bet it'd be the same 2% of this group
of people that are out of a hundred

1552
01:27:18,501 --> 01:27:21,110
suck. Maybe that's the number.
Maybe that is the number.

1553
01:27:21,111 --> 01:27:25,440
Cause I've always said it's like 50% like
it's, I don't, it's like sociopath's.

1554
01:27:25,441 --> 01:27:28,260
Right. One in a hundred people is a
sociopath or something crazy like that.

1555
01:27:28,330 --> 01:27:31,700
He like that. Yeah, that's,
that's a disturbing figure man.

1556
01:27:31,870 --> 01:27:35,330
One to a hundred people doesn't care
if you're fucked up and not one in a

1557
01:27:35,330 --> 01:27:39,740
hundred people just have no feelings
for other people sticking rods in her

1558
01:27:39,741 --> 01:27:43,940
asshole and well, those are very rare
like serial killers and that sex,

1559
01:27:43,941 --> 01:27:46,550
sex slash by the way,
now that I just remember it,

1560
01:27:46,610 --> 01:27:49,280
I mean you were talking about that
guy who got fucked death by the horse.

1561
01:27:49,290 --> 01:27:52,100
He might have been one of those.
He had piercings all over his balls.

1562
01:27:52,160 --> 01:27:55,310
There you go. There you go. You fucking
nailed it. I totally forgot about that.

1563
01:27:55,311 --> 01:27:58,300
Yeah. The guy had like a member.
He had a gang of piercings.

1564
01:27:58,580 --> 01:28:00,350
If you're doing extreme things like that,

1565
01:28:00,351 --> 01:28:03,450
you've lost the ability to feel
and you've got to think about it.

1566
01:28:03,451 --> 01:28:06,880
You've got a jacket. For me, the
fleshlight is fantastic ladies. Gentlemen,

1567
01:28:06,900 --> 01:28:07,940
get it on.
Joe Rogan.

1568
01:28:08,970 --> 01:28:11,910
Isn't it crazy with that recent
arsonists here in Los Angeles or die?

1569
01:28:11,930 --> 01:28:13,820
It doesn't happen more often that that,

1570
01:28:14,260 --> 01:28:17,360
that one out of a hundred just
doesn't start fucking, I mean,

1571
01:28:17,361 --> 01:28:20,030
I guess it does in some ways,
but not to that extent.

1572
01:28:20,430 --> 01:28:24,290
And reality is what Brian was talking
about earlier is that Brian Kallan was

1573
01:28:24,291 --> 01:28:27,650
talking about earlier, is that this is
a pretty good time to live. You know,

1574
01:28:27,651 --> 01:28:30,680
we can fix it on the negative shit.
This is a pretty good time to live.

1575
01:28:31,010 --> 01:28:33,560
And it's 2012,
you know,

1576
01:28:33,590 --> 01:28:37,050
this big change that everyone's going
to look back on. You know, like the,

1577
01:28:37,051 --> 01:28:41,220
the idea that the Mayans were correct
and the TimeWave zero novelty theory,

1578
01:28:41,230 --> 01:28:42,440
you aware of what that is?
No.

1579
01:28:42,590 --> 01:28:47,510
Timewave zero novelty theory was a
mathematic algorithm created by Terence

1580
01:28:47,510 --> 01:28:52,060
Mckenna, the great silence Psychedelic
Bard and author and botanist. And He, uh,

1581
01:28:52,100 --> 01:28:57,010
went on a mushroom trip in the jungle
and came up with this idea based on the

1582
01:28:57,050 --> 01:28:57,500
chain,

1583
01:28:57,500 --> 01:29:01,850
cause he had studied the teaching and he
came up with this idea that the eating

1584
01:29:01,860 --> 01:29:02,040
was

1585
01:29:02,040 --> 01:29:07,040
a map of time and then he was going to
construct a mathematic algorithm based on

1586
01:29:07,501 --> 01:29:11,880
the each thing that would literally track
progress and human innovation that you

1587
01:29:11,881 --> 01:29:15,930
could track it like a wave. That it
was a mathematical program. Wow. Yeah.

1588
01:29:15,931 --> 01:29:20,430
That's how high he got. How about that?
Sit around and think about the fucking,

1589
01:29:20,670 --> 01:29:21,960
they have original thoughts that are,

1590
01:29:21,961 --> 01:29:26,961
so it came and it came to a point
of what he called ultimate novelty,

1591
01:29:27,690 --> 01:29:30,720
which means something,
novelty, meaning innovation,

1592
01:29:30,721 --> 01:29:35,721
novelty being some new thing that had
not existed before or some new branch of

1593
01:29:35,791 --> 01:29:36,624
some new thing.

1594
01:29:36,690 --> 01:29:41,690
And that a period of a point of ultimate
Davonte will be achieved December 21st,

1595
01:29:42,630 --> 01:29:44,520
2012 now here's what's
fucked up about that.

1596
01:29:45,150 --> 01:29:49,920
That is the exact same day to the
day as the end of the Mayan calendar.

1597
01:29:50,250 --> 01:29:55,110
So he came up independently on his own
with this crazy mathematical algorithm

1598
01:29:55,111 --> 01:29:57,210
that I don't even know if it's real.
It sounds ridiculous,

1599
01:29:57,211 --> 01:29:58,530
but if you believe the guy,

1600
01:29:58,680 --> 01:30:02,940
he says that he did not know the end of
the Mayan calendar until much later that

1601
01:30:02,941 --> 01:30:05,820
he had been working on this
mathematical program for like 30 years,

1602
01:30:05,940 --> 01:30:08,220
bringing in mathematicians to work on it.

1603
01:30:08,310 --> 01:30:11,820
And apparently there's some debate over
whether or not he had fudged numbers or

1604
01:30:11,821 --> 01:30:15,390
I don't. I'm way too dumb when it
comes to math to understand any of it.

1605
01:30:15,840 --> 01:30:19,230
But the idea has always fascinated
me of even if it's on a date,

1606
01:30:19,231 --> 01:30:23,160
20 December 24 2012 even if it's
not a date, but the idea of it,

1607
01:30:23,220 --> 01:30:27,030
the idea that it's inevitable that like
really must have, it's going to happen.

1608
01:30:27,210 --> 01:30:31,140
And if you look at how fast
shit has happened to get to
the point we're at today,

1609
01:30:31,290 --> 01:30:33,900
and just a few hundred
300400500 years ago,

1610
01:30:33,990 --> 01:30:38,430
the way we were living is
just an unrecognizable, the
hard surfaces on the road,

1611
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,200
things flying in the sky and the lights.

1612
01:30:42,050 --> 01:30:45,720
And now you know his name because he
made up this whole bullshit. You know,

1613
01:30:45,721 --> 01:30:49,440
like he knew the Mayan calendar from
the whole time. You know what I mean?

1614
01:30:50,140 --> 01:30:50,551
They got it.

1615
01:30:50,551 --> 01:30:54,060
You're saying that that either he knew
about it or he didn't know about it? Well,

1616
01:30:54,061 --> 01:30:56,670
no, they hadn't even know he
had axe. Lord. He knew about it.

1617
01:30:56,671 --> 01:30:59,610
I'm pretty sure he actually
had come up with it.

1618
01:31:00,570 --> 01:31:03,930
I'm pretty sure it's been proven that he
had either come up with it before they

1619
01:31:03,931 --> 01:31:08,260
had deciphered the Mayan calendar or it
was that he definitely hadn't studied it

1620
01:31:08,261 --> 01:31:11,200
and it wasn't mainstream news enough.
There was, it was enough though.

1621
01:31:11,220 --> 01:31:14,370
I would give him the benefit of the
doubt and plus the dude was like super

1622
01:31:14,371 --> 01:31:16,560
honest. It's like if you listen
to Terence Mckenna lectures,

1623
01:31:16,740 --> 01:31:20,820
really fascinating individual, had an
interesting, fascinating things to say,

1624
01:31:21,150 --> 01:31:25,260
but brilliant, brilliant guy.
He goes mad, really amazing.

1625
01:31:25,770 --> 01:31:28,080
Matthew has killed me,
but he's on a math theorists.

1626
01:31:28,081 --> 01:31:29,850
See that's the crazy
thing is that he wasn't,

1627
01:31:30,030 --> 01:31:34,470
he just had this crazy idea that came
to him on mushrooms and this is the most

1628
01:31:34,471 --> 01:31:37,320
ridiculous aspect of it was he
asked the mushrooms, why me?

1629
01:31:37,470 --> 01:31:39,960
Why are you giving this to me? And they
said, because out of the, you know,

1630
01:31:39,990 --> 01:31:42,510
thousands of years that
we've been in this field,

1631
01:31:42,600 --> 01:31:45,690
no one's ever come up to us who had
the teaching and their head before.

1632
01:31:46,170 --> 01:31:50,970
So what it was was to him was he happened
to be in a place where he had studied

1633
01:31:50,971 --> 01:31:55,971
some incredibly ancient
Chinese divination system.

1634
01:31:56,370 --> 01:31:59,890
It's a real mystery with the, each
thing is because it's a method of like

1635
01:32:00,070 --> 01:32:03,580
fortune telling and it seems to
be like incredibly effective,

1636
01:32:03,581 --> 01:32:07,270
like statistically numerically effective.
It's really weird.

1637
01:32:07,271 --> 01:32:09,940
Like people try to figure out
what it is about the ching,

1638
01:32:10,180 --> 01:32:13,240
but it works more than it doesn't work.
And what does that even mean?

1639
01:32:13,241 --> 01:32:16,000
I don't know. I don't understand
it, but it's based on hexagrams.

1640
01:32:16,150 --> 01:32:19,750
It's based on these patterns and
Mckenna coming into this field,

1641
01:32:19,751 --> 01:32:22,330
eating these mushrooms,
tripping, it's fucking balls out,

1642
01:32:22,450 --> 01:32:26,290
had this ridiculous idea that what the
each and really was with the Chinese at

1643
01:32:26,291 --> 01:32:27,520
some point in history way,

1644
01:32:27,521 --> 01:32:31,120
way a long fucking time ago
had figured out a map of time.

1645
01:32:31,870 --> 01:32:34,090
Well you know like, like the
guy when it feels metal, right?

1646
01:32:34,091 --> 01:32:37,270
When he figured the answer out there
was an equation. The Russian dude. Yeah.

1647
01:32:37,271 --> 01:32:39,700
And so, and they don't even know.
So the quote it just the equation,

1648
01:32:39,701 --> 01:32:42,280
just the question was already
theoretical right there. All right.

1649
01:32:42,640 --> 01:32:45,040
The question is what if
it may not be a question?

1650
01:32:45,060 --> 01:32:47,590
Let's just say it as a question where
Matt and mathematicians had been

1651
01:32:47,591 --> 01:32:50,920
contemplating the answer
for the past 200 years.

1652
01:32:51,160 --> 01:32:53,440
They got comes up the answer
and the answer I think was,

1653
01:32:53,441 --> 01:32:56,500
I think it was like 357 pages long.

1654
01:32:56,710 --> 01:32:59,650
But the funny thing about that is
that at the end of the 350 pages,

1655
01:32:59,890 --> 01:33:04,330
all the great mathematicians went,
fucking guy. He got it. He fucking,

1656
01:33:04,570 --> 01:33:06,880
ah,
I miss that Dan.

1657
01:33:06,881 --> 01:33:11,881
And he like think about your mindset that
you were able to read the answer that

1658
01:33:11,891 --> 01:33:15,670
but 357 pages long ago. Ah
Fuck. And then as a group,

1659
01:33:15,850 --> 01:33:20,050
the group of great mathematicians that
award the metal go mother fucker for one

1660
01:33:20,051 --> 01:33:23,270
person. That is an incredible
achievement. Right. But the answer is it,

1661
01:33:23,280 --> 01:33:26,260
but also the fact that you can prove
mathematically that the answer has right.

1662
01:33:26,590 --> 01:33:29,310
That's pretty cool. That's
pretty cool. Right? I mean,

1663
01:33:29,710 --> 01:33:33,780
whether you want to be real clear that
I'm not supporting this Mckenna Theory

1664
01:33:33,840 --> 01:33:36,700
[inaudible] I am absolutely not,

1665
01:33:36,720 --> 01:33:41,600
but much money did door am I 12 he's dead
bro. Like how much do you think? Oh no,

1666
01:33:41,650 --> 01:33:44,860
eight off of that. Well, one of the
things, you can look at it that way,

1667
01:33:44,861 --> 01:33:48,430
but I think he made a lot more money
off of lectures on psychedelics than he

1668
01:33:48,431 --> 01:33:50,200
ever did on this time wave zero thing.

1669
01:33:50,500 --> 01:33:52,840
When you look at the fact that the
guy worked on it for over 30 years,

1670
01:33:52,841 --> 01:33:55,990
it seems to be some weird labor
of love and obsession that he had.

1671
01:33:56,020 --> 01:33:58,540
I don't know if it's correct.
I don't know if it makes any sense at all.

1672
01:33:58,541 --> 01:33:59,680
I don't know if it's total horseshit.

1673
01:33:59,920 --> 01:34:03,280
I just think it's fascinating that a
person would spend so much time making a

1674
01:34:03,281 --> 01:34:07,180
correlation between the
each thing and a 13 cycle,

1675
01:34:07,181 --> 01:34:09,910
28 day lunar calendar,
that it is a,

1676
01:34:09,911 --> 01:34:13,030
apparently it's like more accurate than
the calendar that we employ today and

1677
01:34:13,031 --> 01:34:15,220
that you could use the,
each ching as a calendar and the,

1678
01:34:15,221 --> 01:34:19,230
each thing was somehow or another,
some map of waves and that the,

1679
01:34:19,231 --> 01:34:23,230
that novelty and, and positive
things, it comes in it. The never,

1680
01:34:23,231 --> 01:34:27,410
it's never a steady rise to the top
you're

1681
01:34:27,410 --> 01:34:30,750
bringing up is that the fact of the
matter is with, with technology,

1682
01:34:30,751 --> 01:34:33,710
and we talked about this before,
we're probably going to live.

1683
01:34:33,711 --> 01:34:35,480
If you live long enough
for the next 30 years,

1684
01:34:36,170 --> 01:34:40,370
we're probably going to live through
things that are going to take our entire

1685
01:34:40,371 --> 01:34:45,170
paradigm of reality and what we see as
reality and certainly the world we live

1686
01:34:45,171 --> 01:34:49,210
in and, and, and destroy the entire,

1687
01:34:49,220 --> 01:34:51,290
the boundaries dissolve the boundaries.

1688
01:34:52,840 --> 01:34:56,440
I mean we'll have to reinvent what,
um,

1689
01:34:56,480 --> 01:34:59,450
I think that questions of being
a human being will always remain.

1690
01:34:59,750 --> 01:35:02,750
I think there are questions that
we ask ourselves as human beings.

1691
01:35:02,780 --> 01:35:07,100
What is fulfillment? Or who am I, what am
I doing here? It doesn't questions that,

1692
01:35:07,101 --> 01:35:09,110
those are questions that you can't,

1693
01:35:09,140 --> 01:35:11,420
that's a responsibility
you can't run away from.

1694
01:35:11,450 --> 01:35:15,530
It's why I love like Seneca and reading
those guys cause you read those fuckers

1695
01:35:15,710 --> 01:35:18,050
and that these dudes were
sat around thinking 25,

1696
01:35:18,051 --> 01:35:20,620
3,500 years ago and they came
up with questions that we,

1697
01:35:20,621 --> 01:35:24,890
you still have to answer it. And most of
us, most of it, when you read that Shit,

1698
01:35:25,160 --> 01:35:28,280
you, you go, you go, you use
what happens to you as you go,

1699
01:35:28,310 --> 01:35:30,380
oh I'm living in a fucking,

1700
01:35:30,440 --> 01:35:35,000
I'm living in a glass house or a box of
cards. Like most of my belief system,

1701
01:35:35,001 --> 01:35:38,690
most of how I live my life, a lot of
times, you know, when you read it you go,

1702
01:35:39,500 --> 01:35:42,290
there's not a lot of scaffolding for
that. There's not a lot of, you know,

1703
01:35:42,291 --> 01:35:46,880
there's not a lot of like I can't really
justify it along true moral or truthful

1704
01:35:46,881 --> 01:35:49,430
terms. And that's what
Socrates in Seneca would do.

1705
01:35:49,431 --> 01:35:52,400
He would just ask you questions like
that. It's really interesting. You know,

1706
01:35:52,401 --> 01:35:56,090
you Kinda, you Kinda, that's why reading
the dialogues is such a mind fuck.

1707
01:35:56,240 --> 01:35:58,700
Cause all it is is just a
series of questions and you go,

1708
01:35:59,030 --> 01:36:03,260
fuck well I believe this and they have
some standing and now you're asking me a

1709
01:36:03,261 --> 01:36:04,760
question I don't really
have the answer to.

1710
01:36:06,080 --> 01:36:11,030
I was listening to this talk about the
library of Alexandria and how it was

1711
01:36:11,031 --> 01:36:13,100
burned down.
Not once but twice,

1712
01:36:13,160 --> 01:36:17,570
once by a followers of the
Qur'an. And they, they, you know,

1713
01:36:17,571 --> 01:36:19,720
they apparently they looked at it.
Yeah.

1714
01:36:19,730 --> 01:36:22,310
The Muslim said that apparently
they looked at it and
said to anything here that

1715
01:36:22,311 --> 01:36:26,990
disputes the Qur'an is heredic anything
that supports the Qur'an is unnecessary.

1716
01:36:27,020 --> 01:36:29,900
Burn the whole fucking thing down.
It's like a million volumes.

1717
01:36:30,200 --> 01:36:33,680
And it was essentially the same people
that built the God damn fucking pyramids,

1718
01:36:33,970 --> 01:36:37,670
you know? I mean what kind of
information was lost? I mean, how,

1719
01:36:37,790 --> 01:36:39,290
like when you talk about the each thing,

1720
01:36:39,291 --> 01:36:42,690
if Macquarie forget about whether or
not it's really a map of time and I make

1721
01:36:42,770 --> 01:36:47,060
but what it, what is it? It
is really obviously something
incredibly complicated,

1722
01:36:47,240 --> 01:36:50,050
you know, and that there's this
series of hexagrams and the,

1723
01:36:50,100 --> 01:36:52,730
there's obviously something to it.
It's not a random thing.

1724
01:36:52,900 --> 01:36:54,350
There's something studied about it.

1725
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:59,090
How the Irish saved civilization. Have
you heard of it? No. By Kaplan is, um,

1726
01:36:59,650 --> 01:37:01,840
the camera thing. His name is
Kevin. He's great, great historian.

1727
01:37:01,841 --> 01:37:05,800
I've read a couple of his books and uh,
the when, during the dark ages, after,

1728
01:37:05,801 --> 01:37:10,420
when when Alexandra was burned down and,
and a lot of during the crusades,

1729
01:37:10,990 --> 01:37:14,440
the Christian Crusades and also
during, during the, um, the,

1730
01:37:14,470 --> 01:37:16,720
when the Ottoman Empire came
in and took over and things,

1731
01:37:17,110 --> 01:37:18,700
a lot of this knowledge was lost.

1732
01:37:18,940 --> 01:37:22,660
But the people that actually were the
only people that could write back then in

1733
01:37:22,661 --> 01:37:26,560
Europe were primarily the Irish scribe,
the Irish clergy,

1734
01:37:27,100 --> 01:37:30,490
the priests, and they would
write down, they would date,

1735
01:37:30,491 --> 01:37:32,110
they copied these books.

1736
01:37:32,111 --> 01:37:35,950
They wrote painstakingly capitalized
books and carry them around with them.

1737
01:37:35,951 --> 01:37:38,140
And carry them in their
oral traditions as well.

1738
01:37:38,500 --> 01:37:40,600
And so a lot of that information like uh,

1739
01:37:40,900 --> 01:37:44,860
like the Greeks and all the things that
we base our political system on was

1740
01:37:44,861 --> 01:37:47,650
carried through.
At least the thesis of this book was,

1741
01:37:47,651 --> 01:37:50,530
was carried through by these,
by these Irish scribes by this hour,

1742
01:37:50,650 --> 01:37:55,650
by the Irish clergy who during the dark
ages kept the tradition of alive in

1743
01:37:55,921 --> 01:37:56,250
books

1744
01:37:56,250 --> 01:37:58,950
and kept their own libraries hidden.
This is an amazing,

1745
01:37:58,951 --> 01:38:01,140
when you look back at like really,

1746
01:38:01,141 --> 01:38:06,141
really ancient academics like you know
when when people would go to Egypt,

1747
01:38:07,080 --> 01:38:09,570
a lot of the Greeks would
travel to Egypt to study.

1748
01:38:09,980 --> 01:38:14,580
You know that there was at one point in
time there was obviously some gigantic

1749
01:38:14,581 --> 01:38:16,750
pool of information. There was a, I'm a,

1750
01:38:16,780 --> 01:38:20,800
I'm a much more advanced aside and
then we give credit to I theirs,

1751
01:38:20,880 --> 01:38:25,320
that's for sure. That's amazing isn't
it? Some asshole burned it all down.

1752
01:38:25,321 --> 01:38:29,130
They lost everything. But then,
but then you don't lose everything.

1753
01:38:29,220 --> 01:38:32,400
But then as you get older but it's like
it's probably more advanced today. Right.

1754
01:38:32,401 --> 01:38:37,401
And you assume a yes in many ways
because we are privy to more information

1755
01:38:37,710 --> 01:38:40,770
because we are becoming,
you know, it's like, um, I,

1756
01:38:40,780 --> 01:38:45,720
I would liken it to how how martial
arts has changed exponentially because

1757
01:38:45,721 --> 01:38:47,530
everybody is sharing of
information with you.

1758
01:38:47,530 --> 01:38:51,270
You can agree with you 100%
until we started talking
about the pyramids and then

1759
01:38:51,271 --> 01:38:53,770
I just go, we'll explain that.
How the hell did they do that?

1760
01:38:54,090 --> 01:38:58,110
That's amazing to at least 2,500 BC,

1761
01:38:58,111 --> 01:39:02,460
maybe even early. Insane. That,
that's a good point too. I mean,

1762
01:39:02,461 --> 01:39:06,540
it's the most amazing
physical accomplishment that
human beings have ever done.

1763
01:39:06,541 --> 01:39:08,520
Forget about.
Not In the industrial age.

1764
01:39:08,521 --> 01:39:11,160
I also think like if you look at Saint
Peter's Cathedral, you've ever been there?

1765
01:39:11,161 --> 01:39:13,650
Have you ever seen that? No. And
photos, but it is incredible.

1766
01:39:14,010 --> 01:39:17,040
It's beyond what you can imagine.
And even as young boys to go there,

1767
01:39:17,041 --> 01:39:19,680
because my uncle lived in Rome and I would
go and I'd look and I'd spent all the

1768
01:39:19,681 --> 01:39:22,680
time there because that
would never be that.

1769
01:39:22,681 --> 01:39:25,500
Would nobody would ever do that today. And
the reason nobody, that's not true, man.

1770
01:39:25,501 --> 01:39:28,530
Did you hear about that guy
that got arrested in Italy
because they thought that

1771
01:39:28,531 --> 01:39:31,350
he was building some sort of a
military thing and they were gonna,

1772
01:39:31,351 --> 01:39:33,990
they were gonna storm his house
with guns until he let them in.

1773
01:39:34,110 --> 01:39:38,790
He had a modest home in the countryside
and then inside his house was a giant

1774
01:39:38,850 --> 01:39:41,750
fucking construction that went
into the hills and the mountains.

1775
01:39:41,770 --> 01:39:44,760
It was a beautiful cathedral,
incredible artwork.

1776
01:39:44,940 --> 01:39:48,930
I mean this place was massive
and stunning and stunning.

1777
01:39:49,180 --> 01:39:52,500
And it was him and just a few friends
and they somehow or another been working

1778
01:39:52,501 --> 01:39:57,180
on this for 20, 30 years. Everybody was
like, what is this crazy ass hole doing?

1779
01:39:57,181 --> 01:39:58,050
Digging a hole,
dude,

1780
01:39:58,051 --> 01:40:01,650
you have to look at it because
it is art for the sake of art.

1781
01:40:01,800 --> 01:40:04,270
He didn't want anyone to know about
it. He did. And it's beautiful.

1782
01:40:04,271 --> 01:40:08,270
He has rooms that are like Egyptian
rooms where like hieroglyphs sarcophagus.

1783
01:40:08,720 --> 01:40:12,240
It's online just to look
up, um, uh, Italian, uh,

1784
01:40:12,270 --> 01:40:15,470
Home Mountain,
uh,

1785
01:40:15,690 --> 01:40:19,920
look up or what would you call it? Art
Work. What would would you call it?

1786
01:40:19,940 --> 01:40:23,510
A Cathedral temple. Temple.
Italian home temple. Well,

1787
01:40:23,511 --> 01:40:28,140
what I mean is that the craft of
stone making and, and when, when one,

1788
01:40:28,170 --> 01:40:32,730
when when they take a tap street and two
generations of artists would work on it.

1789
01:40:32,940 --> 01:40:34,950
So you one generation to
work on it for his lifetime,

1790
01:40:34,951 --> 01:40:36,280
then die in the next generation.

1791
01:40:36,320 --> 01:40:39,570
The next day his apprentice would come
and finish it and all those things.

1792
01:40:39,750 --> 01:40:41,760
When you look at Saint Peter's Cathedral,
that was so,

1793
01:40:41,761 --> 01:40:44,490
that was a group of people
that are so divinely inspired.

1794
01:40:44,491 --> 01:40:48,120
The notion that they were just making
what you said art for Art's sake as an

1795
01:40:48,121 --> 01:40:50,070
Omar, come over here and
look at this real quick.

1796
01:40:50,130 --> 01:40:53,800
Come over and look at this real quick. Put
this down. Look up folks. Look up eggs.

1797
01:40:53,830 --> 01:40:54,100
Eighth

1798
01:40:54,100 --> 01:40:58,180
wonder of the world on the
Wii u k or the mail online.

1799
01:40:58,420 --> 01:41:02,200
Stunning tempo. See really carved out
below ground by paranormal. Eccentric.

1800
01:41:02,410 --> 01:41:04,600
Look at these fucking photos, man. I mean,

1801
01:41:04,630 --> 01:41:08,000
you can't even wrap your head
around this shit. This is uh, this,

1802
01:41:08,010 --> 01:41:12,010
this guy made this in,
in a countryside.

1803
01:41:13,120 --> 01:41:17,830
It's insane. I mean, this guy built
all this shit in the countryside, man.

1804
01:41:18,520 --> 01:41:22,120
Look at this. Look at a ceiling. Wow. No,

1805
01:41:22,570 --> 01:41:27,100
it's incredible. It's you would say that,
but he did it today. This is recent.

1806
01:41:27,220 --> 01:41:31,060
Look at this. I mean this is incredible
shit. Look at the floor on this place.

1807
01:41:31,270 --> 01:41:32,740
Look at the artwork on the pillar.

1808
01:41:32,741 --> 01:41:36,130
I mean it is some of the most stunning
shit and I don't like that stuff.

1809
01:41:36,131 --> 01:41:39,190
Like I was over these people's house.
They were there. Very nice folks,

1810
01:41:39,400 --> 01:41:43,210
but they have this ridiculous mural like
a painted mural on the wall and it's

1811
01:41:43,211 --> 01:41:46,070
like bad art and it looks
so like a boat and shit.

1812
01:41:46,420 --> 01:41:48,930
Fucking asshole fishermen and you're
like, what are you doing? Is there a wall?

1813
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:52,450
There's the restaurant by my house and
just hired their daughter. I'm sorry.

1814
01:41:52,451 --> 01:41:54,220
One more. Take a look
at this. I want to show,

1815
01:41:54,250 --> 01:41:56,530
this is the hallway that leads into it.
Who did that?

1816
01:41:56,650 --> 01:41:59,260
They carved that into the mountain.
The carved out in the mountain. Yeah.

1817
01:41:59,261 --> 01:42:02,800
It's an amazing folks that you've got
to folks that are just listening to the

1818
01:42:02,801 --> 01:42:05,340
artwork on the wall is spectacular.
The floor,

1819
01:42:05,360 --> 01:42:08,770
the marble and the floor is
just immaculate. It's amazing.

1820
01:42:08,771 --> 01:42:12,850
And look at this is the outside of
the house. Yup. Just a regular house.

1821
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:16,270
Just a weird regular house.
That's cool. Yep. And they were,

1822
01:42:16,450 --> 01:42:18,460
they were moving so much dirt out
of there that everybody was like,

1823
01:42:18,461 --> 01:42:20,770
and they did it for a
long ass fucking time.

1824
01:42:22,210 --> 01:42:26,860
That's what makes the world a better
place. They occupy 300,000 cubic feet.

1825
01:42:26,890 --> 01:42:30,610
That's an act of faith. You know that,
that's an active thing of this big Ben.

1826
01:42:30,640 --> 01:42:35,020
The clock is 15,000 cubic
feet under this guy's house.

1827
01:42:35,110 --> 01:42:39,280
He had 300,000 cubic feet.

1828
01:42:39,910 --> 01:42:43,660
Think of how big this fucking thing
is that this guy built inside the

1829
01:42:43,661 --> 01:42:46,510
countryside underneath his house.
That's incredible. It's amazing.

1830
01:42:46,540 --> 01:42:50,380
57 year old former insurance broker
from northern Italy who inspired by a

1831
01:42:50,381 --> 01:42:53,320
childhood vision began
digging into the rock.

1832
01:42:53,770 --> 01:42:58,690
It all began the 60s when
he was 10. God Damn. Yeah.

1833
01:42:58,720 --> 01:43:02,380
There's some mother fuckers out,
dude. I mean, why isn't this a movie?

1834
01:43:03,140 --> 01:43:06,820
[inaudible] went blind from painting
the Sistine Chapel. Oh yeah. By the way,

1835
01:43:06,850 --> 01:43:10,300
I credit, uh, I credited Leonardo
Davinci without the other day.

1836
01:43:10,301 --> 01:43:12,610
We were super high. Me and
Everlast we're talking. So folks,

1837
01:43:12,820 --> 01:43:15,220
folks corrected me on Twitter. Thank
you very much. I appreciate it.

1838
01:43:15,340 --> 01:43:19,870
For some reason when I get high,
I forget that Leonardo Davinci and uh,

1839
01:43:19,920 --> 01:43:23,790
bank that they were their contemporaries
though. Yes, they were. But I forgot that,

1840
01:43:23,950 --> 01:43:26,800
you know, I forgot that the Michelangelo
was a different guy. Yes. You know,

1841
01:43:26,840 --> 01:43:29,860
leader out at Vinci and Michelangelo,
my stupid head or like one personnel.

1842
01:43:29,861 --> 01:43:32,560
In fact, if you read the agony and
the access saved by Irving stone,

1843
01:43:32,600 --> 01:43:37,600
but just short kind of skinny with a
pug nose and that Da Vinci was a stud,

1844
01:43:38,200 --> 01:43:40,630
he's a stud beginning and Davinci did.

1845
01:43:40,631 --> 01:43:45,490
Davinci was the one who was the real a
inventor to Michelangelo was a Badass

1846
01:43:45,550 --> 01:43:49,210
artists. But Davinci was a convent
and fucking space planes and shit.

1847
01:43:49,240 --> 01:43:51,890
That's right. Yeah. What a,
what a freak show. That guy

1848
01:43:52,790 --> 01:43:55,550
fucking chaplain went blind.
He couldn't stop when the greatest thing,

1849
01:43:55,580 --> 01:43:59,150
the greatest fucking, the greatest line
for a Michelangelo when he, when he,

1850
01:43:59,670 --> 01:44:03,500
and to define what you are as a person
and art was when he looked at the fucking,

1851
01:44:03,501 --> 01:44:04,010
uh,

1852
01:44:04,010 --> 01:44:08,330
at this huge piece of marble and he's
about to carve the statue of David and his

1853
01:44:08,331 --> 01:44:12,200
girlfriend at the time is one
love said to him, what, uh,

1854
01:44:12,410 --> 01:44:15,290
how are you going to do this? And
he said, it's already in there.

1855
01:44:15,530 --> 01:44:17,630
I just have to get all
the stuff out of the way.

1856
01:44:18,050 --> 01:44:20,630
And it was a great metaphor
for art or a human being.

1857
01:44:20,631 --> 01:44:24,680
Like you start a piece of shit and as
you can delete enough stuff you, you can,

1858
01:44:24,900 --> 01:44:27,740
you know, just through hard
work and carving and stuff,

1859
01:44:27,741 --> 01:44:29,000
you can become a better person.

1860
01:44:29,030 --> 01:44:33,650
It's so important that people do things
and that you do things and other people

1861
01:44:33,651 --> 01:44:37,130
enjoy. Correct. Action
is huge. Whatever it is,

1862
01:44:37,131 --> 01:44:39,560
whether you're a fucking a
Datsun repairmen and you're like,

1863
01:44:39,590 --> 01:44:42,200
oh Frankie and failure is,

1864
01:44:42,230 --> 01:44:45,080
is more important than success
to become a better person. It's,

1865
01:44:45,290 --> 01:44:47,420
you asked to look at fighters but,

1866
01:44:47,421 --> 01:44:50,250
but what I'm saying is that like
doing something that people enjoy,

1867
01:44:50,251 --> 01:44:54,350
it really is like the fucking key to
happiness in life is like doing something

1868
01:44:54,351 --> 01:44:55,970
that makes other people happy in some way.

1869
01:44:56,150 --> 01:44:57,920
It really is the key to happiness in life.

1870
01:44:58,250 --> 01:45:00,200
And it's one that so few
people ever figured out.

1871
01:45:00,201 --> 01:45:02,990
And that's one of the reasons why people
were so fucked up is because so many

1872
01:45:02,991 --> 01:45:05,840
people have this selfish,
it's all about me attitude.

1873
01:45:05,841 --> 01:45:09,350
And you don't understand that you
will never be happy. Not only that,

1874
01:45:09,500 --> 01:45:10,790
you will be prosperous,

1875
01:45:10,791 --> 01:45:15,791
either you won't be because you are a
part of a gigantic system and you are in a

1876
01:45:16,310 --> 01:45:19,910
symbiotic relationship with every human
being that you come in contact with.

1877
01:45:19,910 --> 01:45:22,970
So when you fuck them over,
you fuck up your whole system.

1878
01:45:23,170 --> 01:45:27,350
You spread out negative energy,
you put out bad ripples and it comes back.

1879
01:45:27,380 --> 01:45:29,220
It's impossible not to see it with fight.

1880
01:45:29,221 --> 01:45:32,750
Or sometimes you see fighters start come
in with like a lot of guys who are real

1881
01:45:32,751 --> 01:45:37,040
angry and there and they come from broken
homes and they're just fucking sour

1882
01:45:37,850 --> 01:45:38,420
guys.

1883
01:45:38,420 --> 01:45:42,140
But they learn and they learn and to get
better they have to confront that anger

1884
01:45:42,141 --> 01:45:43,310
and they have to learn to control it.

1885
01:45:43,311 --> 01:45:45,140
And a lot of times by
the time they're done,

1886
01:45:45,380 --> 01:45:50,240
they come out of it really well adjusted
just men in some ways. The best guys,

1887
01:45:50,241 --> 01:45:54,620
the best of the best are martial
artists. You know, Anderson Silva,

1888
01:45:54,621 --> 01:45:57,330
he's a martial artist.
He's a martial artist.

1889
01:45:57,331 --> 01:46:00,110
Would you say is in the George
Saint Pierre is and martial artists,

1890
01:46:00,111 --> 01:46:02,630
no doubt about it.
He is 100% martial artists.

1891
01:46:02,810 --> 01:46:05,600
And the way he behaves around people,
the way he conducts himself,

1892
01:46:05,780 --> 01:46:10,520
he conducts himself as an exemplary
member of society who can fuck you up.

1893
01:46:10,850 --> 01:46:13,310
That's what he does is you never get the
feeling hanging out with chores that he

1894
01:46:13,311 --> 01:46:16,100
can kick your ass. You never get the
feeling. Of course he can, you know,

1895
01:46:16,101 --> 01:46:20,030
he can the cycle, you know,
psychologically, realistically,

1896
01:46:20,031 --> 01:46:22,190
you know you can kick your ass but you
never feel that around him because he's

1897
01:46:22,191 --> 01:46:25,280
always so humble and so
friendly and so nice.

1898
01:46:25,380 --> 01:46:26,990
Where we were talking about that though,
you know,

1899
01:46:26,991 --> 01:46:31,450
some people have a lot of trouble
managing success and a huge,

1900
01:46:31,490 --> 01:46:35,020
it's a character issue. It's whether or
not you accept bullshit lies or you know,

1901
01:46:35,030 --> 01:46:37,330
whether or not you look
at yourself realistically,

1902
01:46:37,870 --> 01:46:39,500
it doesn't get better and stay on top.

1903
01:46:39,530 --> 01:46:41,720
You've got to confront that
in your store thing all day,

1904
01:46:41,721 --> 01:46:43,790
every day and you have to
have a completely open mind.

1905
01:46:43,820 --> 01:46:46,580
That's why a lot of fighters choke or
they freeze up and stuff and it's just

1906
01:46:46,581 --> 01:46:50,430
human. You know, you've got to be able
to assess your objective, your, your,

1907
01:46:50,431 --> 01:46:53,760
your objective strengths and weaknesses
at a moment's notice and you've gotta be

1908
01:46:53,761 --> 01:46:55,170
able to do it completely accurately.

1909
01:46:55,171 --> 01:46:59,130
You can be burdened down by some ego
that has you convinced that you're right

1910
01:46:59,131 --> 01:47:01,080
and you're doing it
together and avoid all the,

1911
01:47:01,440 --> 01:47:06,440
you also have to be doing it to
some extent to to check in in.

1912
01:47:07,110 --> 01:47:10,320
It's, it's a fine line because you don't
want to do things for other people.

1913
01:47:10,321 --> 01:47:11,730
You're doing it to surprise yourself,

1914
01:47:11,731 --> 01:47:14,880
but your motivation has to be pure
because if your motivation is not,

1915
01:47:15,210 --> 01:47:19,770
you will pay a price for it. You Do,
you do it for art, man. You know,

1916
01:47:19,771 --> 01:47:23,640
when I don't, this is how I
approach everything. I write.
Okay. I, you know, I say,

1917
01:47:23,641 --> 01:47:26,230
well, you know, I really got
to get together and fucking
do some writing today.

1918
01:47:26,231 --> 01:47:27,360
I'm don't be lazy bitch.

1919
01:47:27,390 --> 01:47:30,330
And then I sit down and I started
writing and I never say, okay,

1920
01:47:30,331 --> 01:47:33,320
here I'm going to write things for
people. I'm going to, I, I got to,

1921
01:47:33,360 --> 01:47:36,810
whatever it is, I got to conjure it
up. I got to let that bitch trying to,

1922
01:47:36,820 --> 01:47:39,690
I'm trying to be funny. I just try to
write what I think is interesting. Well,

1923
01:47:39,691 --> 01:47:41,610
that's one of the reasons why I enjoyed,
uh,

1924
01:47:41,640 --> 01:47:44,070
writing blogs before I started
writing my book. I started,

1925
01:47:44,071 --> 01:47:47,460
I was writing a lot of blogs and there's
still all up@joerogan.net somewhere you

1926
01:47:47,461 --> 01:47:51,730
could find them. We need to make
that shit easy to find. Um, it's uh,

1927
01:47:52,110 --> 01:47:55,020
yeah cause the blogs and the videos
were all together in the same pile

1928
01:47:56,590 --> 01:47:57,440
because you have blogs,

1929
01:47:57,480 --> 01:48:01,230
you have it as a blog or most people
don't even know what a tag is. Dude,

1930
01:48:01,590 --> 01:48:04,380
most people just want something
real clean, clean can click on,

1931
01:48:04,381 --> 01:48:07,440
here's the shit you wrote. Click.
Well, I'll get that done eventually.

1932
01:48:07,441 --> 01:48:10,500
But my point is that I would never write
anything on purpose. Trying to be funny.

1933
01:48:10,530 --> 01:48:13,800
I would just sit down and just
look, man, the world is funny.

1934
01:48:13,801 --> 01:48:16,410
This is just stupid shit that's
going on all day, every day.

1935
01:48:16,411 --> 01:48:20,280
If you can't see some funny in the world.
But it's also the, that's some funny,

1936
01:48:20,490 --> 01:48:22,290
especially when you're writing blogs,

1937
01:48:22,620 --> 01:48:25,290
it's all always balanced out
with the shit that's not funny.

1938
01:48:25,291 --> 01:48:27,890
That makes the funny stuff
even funnier. It's like, it's,

1939
01:48:27,990 --> 01:48:30,720
it's got to be whatever the
fuck is coming out of there.

1940
01:48:30,960 --> 01:48:34,890
And then I just extract the jokes from
that. The stuff that's actually funny,

1941
01:48:34,891 --> 01:48:36,060
I extract it from that.

1942
01:48:36,090 --> 01:48:40,240
The ironic point we've always looked at
your comedy is to me has always been, um,

1943
01:48:40,460 --> 01:48:43,080
you know, I've always been, I've
always been more absurd, but you,

1944
01:48:43,081 --> 01:48:46,740
you look at the truth of situation
and then you just fucking, you just,

1945
01:48:46,741 --> 01:48:48,990
you carve it out and shine a light on it.

1946
01:48:49,110 --> 01:48:53,240
I try to put a lot of observed and there
as well because I found out along the

1947
01:48:53,250 --> 01:48:56,520
way that first of all not being
observed can be a trap. You know,

1948
01:48:56,750 --> 01:49:00,230
people take it seriously. I don't want
you to take me seriously, man. I don't,

1949
01:49:00,231 --> 01:49:04,120
I just, I don't have time for that. Okay.
So please don't, you know, but that,

1950
01:49:04,121 --> 01:49:06,990
that becomes a trap and I've
seen some comics fall into it,

1951
01:49:06,991 --> 01:49:10,170
especially when they develop a following.
You know, they have a, this, a,

1952
01:49:10,171 --> 01:49:13,650
this group of people that want to follow
in the way of what we're talking about.

1953
01:49:13,651 --> 01:49:16,590
Don't fucking listen to your following
to passion because you start getting,

1954
01:49:16,591 --> 01:49:20,640
you start believing the hype. You get
older and people like I go on, but yes,

1955
01:49:20,641 --> 01:49:24,900
but appreciate it. But as a
responsibility, it's a resource.

1956
01:49:24,901 --> 01:49:27,880
It's a responsibility that your
friends out there, you know,

1957
01:49:28,200 --> 01:49:30,120
you just got to respect it.
Just don't let it,

1958
01:49:30,121 --> 01:49:33,990
don't let it find you because then you
will start trying to be a certain way.

1959
01:49:33,991 --> 01:49:36,540
They just think it's all about when
it happens to you that you develop a

1960
01:49:36,541 --> 01:49:38,610
following anyway mean develop,
develop a following.

1961
01:49:38,611 --> 01:49:41,280
When you're 17 years old and you're on
a Disney sitcoms and you don't really

1962
01:49:41,281 --> 01:49:43,980
understand yourself or do you
develop yourself when you're,

1963
01:49:44,370 --> 01:49:46,860
when you're 30 and then you,
because back to

1964
01:49:48,280 --> 01:49:52,330
Mark's example, back in the day when your
teacher would taught you martial arts,

1965
01:49:52,331 --> 01:49:54,430
you've got a karate teacher.
He was the master.

1966
01:49:54,431 --> 01:49:56,560
He would never fight
sparring bands or wherever.

1967
01:49:56,561 --> 01:50:00,400
He's two deadly to spar with those.
The Brazilians are like the blue man.

1968
01:50:00,410 --> 01:50:03,190
Like they, they're your teacher. They
fucking rolled with every fucking day.

1969
01:50:03,700 --> 01:50:07,910
That's the difference between real
fighters and guys who are, well no,

1970
01:50:08,020 --> 01:50:11,080
the real issue is striking versus
a Jujitsu. It was, you know,

1971
01:50:11,081 --> 01:50:14,590
because he can't do that every day with
striking. It's just too difficult. I mean,

1972
01:50:14,950 --> 01:50:18,910
if you, if you have a great group of
people where you guarantee, you know,

1973
01:50:18,911 --> 01:50:20,500
like any man, let's
just go light, you know,

1974
01:50:20,501 --> 01:50:23,650
and you really do not try to
kill each other. That's awesome.

1975
01:50:23,920 --> 01:50:24,970
But that's not normal.

1976
01:50:25,150 --> 01:50:27,370
Normal is like the gentleman that
we were talking about earlier today,

1977
01:50:27,380 --> 01:50:29,710
the very successful gentleman, and
we won't, won't mention his name,

1978
01:50:29,890 --> 01:50:33,450
who does know how to spar. He just
tries to kill guys in the gym. You know,

1979
01:50:33,460 --> 01:50:35,800
they tell him, listen to man, you're not
gonna get any fucking sparring partners.

1980
01:50:35,801 --> 01:50:37,700
You're too crazy. You know? And that's,

1981
01:50:37,750 --> 01:50:41,860
that's a god that's he's missing the
whole point. That's exactly right.

1982
01:50:41,920 --> 01:50:44,650
And you know, you missed the
whole camaraderie of being
a teammate with someone,

1983
01:50:44,651 --> 01:50:47,730
part of it as he, you, you know, you build
each other up, you know, you, you, you,

1984
01:50:47,740 --> 01:50:49,840
you could hit your teammate,
but you don't,

1985
01:50:49,870 --> 01:50:52,480
that's one of the things that is
like an extension of those guys.

1986
01:50:52,481 --> 01:50:56,110
They'd all those teams, those teams,
they're, they're just, they become close,

1987
01:50:56,111 --> 01:51:00,010
super close because they're bleeding
and fucking dying together, you know?

1988
01:51:00,011 --> 01:51:02,170
Exactly. And they can trust each
other when they're sparring.

1989
01:51:02,171 --> 01:51:04,510
It's really important, man. You
know, even though you spar hard,

1990
01:51:04,511 --> 01:51:06,970
it's nothing mean dudes are
getting hit no doubt about, look,

1991
01:51:06,971 --> 01:51:11,170
you don't get as good at boxing as Nate
Diaz does unless you got a guy like

1992
01:51:11,380 --> 01:51:13,210
Gilbert Melendez and your camp.
You know what I'm saying?

1993
01:51:13,211 --> 01:51:15,820
Like these guys are going at each other
all the time and they're doing it the

1994
01:51:15,821 --> 01:51:19,280
right way and they're both get good as
fuck. And same thing with Nick, you know,

1995
01:51:19,290 --> 01:51:21,610
you know, he's so God damn good.
And you know what Nick is doing?

1996
01:51:21,760 --> 01:51:23,650
He's constantly boxing with Andre Ward.

1997
01:51:23,651 --> 01:51:27,640
He boxes what Andre Ward is a Olympic gold
medalist. Hell of a box. It brilliant,

1998
01:51:27,670 --> 01:51:29,800
brilliant boxer.
I mean that guy never gets hurt.

1999
01:51:29,801 --> 01:51:34,801
So he boxes and Nick Diaz is
professional boxing level.

2000
01:51:35,411 --> 01:51:38,110
He could, yes. First of
all, he's a super athlete.

2001
01:51:38,140 --> 01:51:42,460
He can put a pace on those dudes
and they can't handle. He's for me,

2002
01:51:42,520 --> 01:51:45,700
he's my favorite fighter. He's a super
endurance athlete. And you look at him,

2003
01:51:45,701 --> 01:51:48,580
he's obviously in great shape.
I mean it's not, it's not that.

2004
01:51:48,581 --> 01:51:52,660
But what you don't understand is his
cardio is like double with a normal humans

2005
01:51:52,670 --> 01:51:57,370
is like literally double. Yeah. And
because he has that man that's a weapon,

2006
01:51:57,490 --> 01:52:00,420
he can use that weapon cause most times
aren't willing to work that hard to

2007
01:52:00,490 --> 01:52:02,560
trial. He does triathlons
all the time, man.

2008
01:52:02,650 --> 01:52:06,080
He'd fucking swam back
from Alcatraz twice price

2009
01:52:07,600 --> 01:52:10,370
and the fucking in the
shark infested water.

2010
01:52:10,660 --> 01:52:13,330
I mean the reason why they put Alcatraz,
there they go, we'll put a prison.

2011
01:52:13,331 --> 01:52:17,050
Who the fuck's gonna swim that they
thought it couldn't be done and this crazy

2012
01:52:17,051 --> 01:52:21,190
assholes. A cage fighter because
done it twice just for the fuck of n.

2013
01:52:21,220 --> 01:52:22,210
That's not even when he does.

2014
01:52:22,211 --> 01:52:25,690
He's not like an ultra endurance swimmer
in the ocean. No, he's a cage fighter.

2015
01:52:25,780 --> 01:52:28,990
But his mind is so strong because of that,

2016
01:52:29,110 --> 01:52:31,990
because he has so much fucking endurance.

2017
01:52:32,140 --> 01:52:35,080
He can just take his name if he goes,
let me tell you something.

2018
01:52:35,081 --> 01:52:39,730
If every round was like a 20 minute round,
you could never beat Nick Diaz.

2019
01:52:39,760 --> 01:52:42,880
You can never beat him because after 15
minutes you'd be huffing and puffing.

2020
01:52:42,970 --> 01:52:44,920
You'd be waiting for that stool
and he'd be like, what? Bitch?

2021
01:52:45,050 --> 01:52:48,260
And we still pop pop pop in with
those 50% punches in the face.

2022
01:52:48,270 --> 01:52:51,290
Does he talk to Funky? Does
you know why? Cause he's smart.

2023
01:52:51,410 --> 01:52:53,870
Cause that's a psychological
war that's going on right there.

2024
01:52:53,960 --> 01:52:57,620
And if you can get a guy flustered and
call him a bitch and get up in his face

2025
01:52:57,621 --> 01:53:00,860
and get him thinking about your emotions,
that's the intelligent thing to do.

2026
01:53:00,980 --> 01:53:03,290
If you want to teligent fighter,
you would add that.

2027
01:53:03,291 --> 01:53:05,820
I know it's beautiful to be a George
Saint Pierre and to, you know,

2028
01:53:05,850 --> 01:53:07,850
to bow at a martial artist and didn't,

2029
01:53:07,851 --> 01:53:10,100
it's never be talking shit
in the middle of a fight.

2030
01:53:10,220 --> 01:53:14,870
Do a completely respectfully and he gets
it done masterfully. But in my opinion,

2031
01:53:15,020 --> 01:53:19,010
I like watching the garlic. Nick Diaz get
in there and go live bitch, bitch, bitch,

2032
01:53:19,340 --> 01:53:20,300
bitch.
Moving his head.

2033
01:53:20,301 --> 01:53:23,870
He's half forest moon is Henna moving
his move his head back and forth talking

2034
01:53:23,871 --> 01:53:27,470
mad shit to truly hate the guys he fight
doesn't until he fights him and then

2035
01:53:27,471 --> 01:53:30,590
he's cool with them. You know, he yells
after he knocked out frank shamrock,

2036
01:53:30,591 --> 01:53:33,080
he'd get it. He goes, come on and get
up. You're a legend. And he helped him,

2037
01:53:33,110 --> 01:53:35,750
helped him. I picked him up by
his here in Lafayette. Same thing.

2038
01:53:35,780 --> 01:53:39,340
Neda's brother Nate. After he beat up
Serone this weekend, he said, you know,

2039
01:53:39,350 --> 01:53:41,750
listen man, it's all good. You
know, it's just hype and bullshit.

2040
01:53:41,751 --> 01:53:45,260
And they hugged and it was cool, you know,
and Serone gave it up to him, period.

2041
01:53:45,261 --> 01:53:46,460
He was a better fighter.
That's it.

2042
01:53:46,490 --> 01:53:50,360
No excuses was he kicked my ass and they
just let it go. It's beautiful. You know,

2043
01:53:50,370 --> 01:53:52,280
I liked that.
I like when dudes can let it go,

2044
01:53:52,640 --> 01:53:55,520
but it's a smart thing
to get guys upset at you.

2045
01:53:55,940 --> 01:53:58,790
Smart thing it seems Nate
and nick don't give a fuck.

2046
01:54:00,380 --> 01:54:03,770
I don't give her dare to kick your
ass and it's, it's really sad.

2047
01:54:03,990 --> 01:54:06,440
I don't want to talk to
you to kick your ass,

2048
01:54:06,441 --> 01:54:09,680
but they're punching I then it sees,
it's brilliant. They're punching.

2049
01:54:09,690 --> 01:54:11,060
It looks like he's moving in slow motion.

2050
01:54:11,061 --> 01:54:12,840
I was watching it the first time
I watched and punch. I was like,

2051
01:54:12,841 --> 01:54:14,210
there's a little bit,
he's, it's so emotional.

2052
01:54:14,211 --> 01:54:17,180
Looks like he's not trying to hurt you.
He's like, dad did that. It did. Oh,

2053
01:54:17,210 --> 01:54:17,751
you know why?

2054
01:54:17,751 --> 01:54:22,250
Because don't throw your punches at a
hundred percent throw your punches at 50%

2055
01:54:22,460 --> 01:54:24,200
land.
82% of them,

2056
01:54:24,440 --> 01:54:28,430
they still hurt and he wasn't even
throwing them at 80% I mean, I would say,

2057
01:54:28,640 --> 01:54:29,990
I would say baby,

2058
01:54:29,991 --> 01:54:33,410
like he went through a lot of punches
that were around 50% of his full power.

2059
01:54:33,410 --> 01:54:36,830
What he could really, if he really wanted
to haul off and blast you in the face,

2060
01:54:36,831 --> 01:54:38,120
he can knock people the fuck out.

2061
01:54:38,360 --> 01:54:42,350
But him and his brother had figured
out this really effective style of like

2062
01:54:42,351 --> 01:54:44,810
volume,
technical topic.

2063
01:54:46,510 --> 01:54:50,240
That's a real good question. And I
would be out of school if I said that,

2064
01:54:50,241 --> 01:54:52,590
but I don't think so. They
have a boxing coach. It was a,

2065
01:54:52,591 --> 01:54:55,370
a Mexican gentleman that's in
the ring with him all the time.

2066
01:54:55,371 --> 01:54:58,790
I should credit him because I need to
find me. It makes me want to go, uh,

2067
01:54:59,060 --> 01:55:03,680
become uh, like a, I'll never, it's over
for me. But you just see those guys.

2068
01:55:03,681 --> 01:55:06,440
They make it look so easy there.
Their submission game,

2069
01:55:06,650 --> 01:55:10,010
they're fucking punching
kids. They're so fun, man.

2070
01:55:10,750 --> 01:55:14,810
Nick Diaz is just, I love it. Sorry.
Sorry. Richard Perez. Richard Perez.

2071
01:55:14,811 --> 01:55:16,310
I should've known.
He's one of those guys that I,

2072
01:55:16,320 --> 01:55:18,950
his name was at the tip of my tongue,
but they'd been with him for a long time.

2073
01:55:18,950 --> 01:55:22,190
He said every one of their fights and
he's there boxing coach and he always,

2074
01:55:22,191 --> 01:55:25,190
you know, they always credit Richard
Perez afterwards and you know what?

2075
01:55:25,220 --> 01:55:29,030
He's gotten them so slick.
Their head movement, their
counters. There are angles,

2076
01:55:29,031 --> 01:55:33,350
man. Dude, two fights. I
mean, how much, how many,

2077
01:55:33,351 --> 01:55:37,370
how many they practice boxing every day.
I mean, oh yeah, they're boxing a lot.

2078
01:55:37,371 --> 01:55:40,520
I mean, they're very boxing centered in
why not be, because look, first of all,

2079
01:55:40,760 --> 01:55:42,500
everyone knows that Jujitsu's nasty.

2080
01:55:42,501 --> 01:55:45,510
So you don't really to take them down
necessarily and wind up in their guard.

2081
01:55:45,511 --> 01:55:49,260
Nate Diaz fucks guys up from his guard
and so does NEC. They both catch guys.

2082
01:55:49,560 --> 01:55:50,790
So we're going to do,
you know,

2083
01:55:50,791 --> 01:55:52,800
you have to stand up with them and
if you want to stand up with them,

2084
01:55:52,870 --> 01:55:56,430
they're both along. And they both were
all these volume punches and I was tap,

2085
01:55:56,431 --> 01:55:59,880
tap, tap, tap, tap. But that pap pap,
and they're so fucking accurate, man.

2086
01:55:59,910 --> 01:56:04,060
So what had broke the Compu strike record.
Nate Diaz. Dad Serone fight happens.

2087
01:56:04,830 --> 01:56:08,970
I think it was 82%. I believe
it was nuts, man. That's nuts.

2088
01:56:10,090 --> 01:56:14,740
[inaudible] I've never seen anything
like it. He boxed him up, man. He was,

2089
01:56:14,741 --> 01:56:15,750
his boxing was brilliant.

2090
01:56:15,840 --> 01:56:19,080
And then in the last two fights and
attacking Nori Gomi fight in this fight,

2091
01:56:19,350 --> 01:56:21,180
he just turned this crazy corner.

2092
01:56:21,181 --> 01:56:24,210
And I think it came out of the
loss to what Roy Mcdonald's,

2093
01:56:24,540 --> 01:56:27,470
that Roy McDonald kid is a
fucking beast. You know that, uh,

2094
01:56:27,690 --> 01:56:31,710
the young man from Canadian Canada, you
know who he is, Roy McDonald, he's uh,

2095
01:56:31,800 --> 01:56:33,980
he's only had a, a few UFC fights. He,

2096
01:56:34,260 --> 01:56:37,200
he had a real close fight with Carlos
condit and he got stopped in the third

2097
01:56:37,201 --> 01:56:39,780
round, but he was winning
the first two rounds and uh,

2098
01:56:39,920 --> 01:56:44,020
it really quick demolition of Mike Pile.
I was like really blown away by that.

2099
01:56:44,310 --> 01:56:46,740
I expected Mike Pile.
It's going to be very difficult for him.

2100
01:56:46,830 --> 01:56:50,750
I mean he caught them early and you know,
you catch anybody really is, no, he's a,

2101
01:56:50,751 --> 01:56:53,250
he's a full on MMA fighter but,
and he's a young kid.

2102
01:56:53,250 --> 01:56:56,460
He's been training him and may only for
his whole life from the beginning to end.

2103
01:56:56,550 --> 01:56:59,370
Well, Nate had a fight with them
and then Nate lost a decision.

2104
01:56:59,510 --> 01:57:02,130
It didn't get hurt. He never got beat
up. He got thrown around a little bit.

2105
01:57:02,131 --> 01:57:05,220
The guy took him down a few times, like
soup plucks them and stuff. But you know,

2106
01:57:05,610 --> 01:57:09,450
one of the things about the Diaz brothers
is there amazing defense. You know,

2107
01:57:09,451 --> 01:57:10,470
they're,
they're always,

2108
01:57:10,471 --> 01:57:14,130
they're so used to fighting against brutal
guys and training that they're really

2109
01:57:14,131 --> 01:57:15,390
good at surviving,
you know,

2110
01:57:15,391 --> 01:57:18,780
and so he realized that he
probably should be at 155 pounds.

2111
01:57:18,781 --> 01:57:22,920
It was like a better way because he was
fighting one 70 and he build up to get

2112
01:57:22,921 --> 01:57:26,760
there. He didn't go up to like one 85 one
90 and then cut his weight down. He was,

2113
01:57:26,761 --> 01:57:29,640
you know, he was essentially,
you know, weighing in like much,

2114
01:57:29,700 --> 01:57:33,420
much closer to the 55 pound women, but
the last two fights, yet at lightweight,

2115
01:57:33,421 --> 01:57:36,720
it was tacking or go me and this last
one against the, and both of them,

2116
01:57:36,721 --> 01:57:39,900
it was just tense. Wrong is no joke,
man. No, he's a beast. You know,

2117
01:57:39,901 --> 01:57:41,220
I think what happened was I think,
you know,

2118
01:57:41,221 --> 01:57:43,170
naked pissed off at himself after that,
uh,

2119
01:57:43,171 --> 01:57:45,990
that fight with Rory Mcdonald and
he said, you know what? Fuck it.

2120
01:57:45,991 --> 01:57:47,900
I'm kicking it up a notch and decided,
you know,

2121
01:57:47,910 --> 01:57:51,030
one 55 was where I was supposed to be.
And they're just really get to,

2122
01:57:51,031 --> 01:57:54,450
it gave him the finger like that, that
now it's beautiful. It's beautiful, man.

2123
01:57:54,451 --> 01:57:57,600
It's, this is war man. It's
psychological war. You know,

2124
01:57:57,610 --> 01:58:00,450
like Larry Bird used to show up at
every three point contest and go,

2125
01:58:00,451 --> 01:58:02,280
who's coming in second?
That's it. You know,

2126
01:58:02,300 --> 01:58:05,160
you gotta think about Larry Bird when
you're fucking shooting that shot now

2127
01:58:05,310 --> 01:58:08,250
because you can't be in the zone because
no one, no one's fucked with you.

2128
01:58:08,251 --> 01:58:10,210
And you could have your
own positive thoughts. No,

2129
01:58:10,230 --> 01:58:13,710
you got Larry Bird's freckly little
white ass cracker phase going,

2130
01:58:13,711 --> 01:58:14,660
who's coming inside?
You know?

2131
01:58:14,670 --> 01:58:16,670
And you know what I said to me when I
saw him give him the finger, I went,

2132
01:58:16,680 --> 01:58:19,320
that guy's not tired. He's not
tired, he doesn't get tired.

2133
01:58:19,321 --> 01:58:21,720
He's just like his brother.
They go on, you know,

2134
01:58:21,750 --> 01:58:24,600
they do some fucking
extreme endurance work, man.

2135
01:58:24,720 --> 01:58:28,560
And they keep their conditioning and a
really high level. And if you do that,

2136
01:58:28,590 --> 01:58:31,320
you can put a face on it, dude, they
can't fuck with. And then on top of that,

2137
01:58:31,321 --> 01:58:34,380
if you have really good striking,
you know, then it's like, man,

2138
01:58:34,410 --> 01:58:38,400
you're getting striking. Like that
is so difficult. That takes balls.

2139
01:58:38,401 --> 01:58:39,570
You have to have balls,

2140
01:58:39,600 --> 01:58:42,040
you have to go in there with
guys who can take your fucking

2141
01:58:42,040 --> 01:58:45,250
face. Yeah. And you get here hit
and hurt. You gotta learn defense.

2142
01:58:45,251 --> 01:58:47,200
You got to learn how to roll with punches.

2143
01:58:47,201 --> 01:58:50,290
You gotta you gotta learn who not to spar
with or some dudes that it's not worth

2144
01:58:50,291 --> 01:58:53,440
it. Some days you could spar him every
now and then like especially if you're

2145
01:58:53,441 --> 01:58:54,730
feeling fresh or something like that.

2146
01:58:55,030 --> 01:58:58,480
Do you think they keep a guy out box
with just strict boxes like Andre Ward?

2147
01:58:58,481 --> 01:59:01,900
Do you start to try to fight
him just to Zach's or MMA guys?

2148
01:59:01,930 --> 01:59:03,400
A lot of different though.
A lot of guys,

2149
01:59:03,401 --> 01:59:06,460
especially in the early days of him and
may like I've had long conversations

2150
01:59:06,461 --> 01:59:10,000
with dude about this dude's about
this who started out in like the early

2151
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:12,160
nineties they didn't know any better
and they would just go full blast in the

2152
01:59:12,161 --> 01:59:13,090
gym all the time.

2153
01:59:13,480 --> 01:59:15,970
And then somewhere along the line
people start telling them like, hey man,

2154
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:16,930
you shouldn't do this.

2155
01:59:16,930 --> 01:59:20,260
Like you guys should be sparring with
technique and this is how you do that and

2156
01:59:20,261 --> 01:59:22,340
this is how you save yourself for the,
yeah,

2157
01:59:22,370 --> 01:59:25,180
because nobody is ever using the
jab back then or anything like that.

2158
01:59:25,480 --> 01:59:27,940
Everybody was like, Hey, maker
central and then you get in there.

2159
01:59:27,941 --> 01:59:30,520
That's one of the reasons why a
guy like Anderson shines. You know,

2160
01:59:30,521 --> 01:59:31,720
you get in there with a guy like Anderson,

2161
01:59:31,721 --> 01:59:35,200
like Chris Liebing just charged at him.
Just went to try to maul him, which was,

2162
01:59:35,201 --> 01:59:37,360
you know, if you're going
to give him a good strategy,

2163
01:59:37,361 --> 01:59:39,120
which is a good strategy
to stay on the outside of,

2164
01:59:39,121 --> 01:59:41,490
let them pick you apart or chase
that motherfucker down. I would,

2165
01:59:41,500 --> 01:59:42,760
I would have told Chris
to do the same thing.

2166
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:47,530
He just wasn't ready for that level yet
in that technical level that Anderson's

2167
01:59:47,531 --> 01:59:51,670
achieved, you know, he has
all the techniques. He doesn't
have just haymakers he's,

2168
01:59:51,700 --> 01:59:55,000
he came from a technical Moyie
Thai background, you know,

2169
01:59:55,001 --> 01:59:57,010
so his technique is beautiful.

2170
01:59:57,040 --> 02:00:01,040
I was watching a tagline office down
in American top team trained with them,

2171
02:00:01,041 --> 02:00:04,270
right? Yeah. Train with that.
It was best friend I guess.

2172
02:00:04,450 --> 02:00:07,720
And coach Muay Thai coach
who's a stud himself,

2173
02:00:07,721 --> 02:00:11,710
just like this real good looking dude.
He's like, and I got, I was, I was so,

2174
02:00:11,711 --> 02:00:15,070
it was so exciting cause Tiago was,
is a big death valley fan.

2175
02:00:15,071 --> 02:00:18,420
So he came up to me, it's like this is a
show that you're on for people. That is,

2176
02:00:18,490 --> 02:00:20,950
I do the, I'm a huge fan.
You May, you crack me up.

2177
02:00:20,951 --> 02:00:23,980
It's so funny and terrible accident.
Not at all.

2178
02:00:23,981 --> 02:00:26,890
But he's so funny and we had such a
laugh when he took me around and we had a

2179
02:00:26,891 --> 02:00:29,710
blast but he gave me a private
Moy Tai class and then,

2180
02:00:29,930 --> 02:00:33,280
and then he rolled with me and Jujitsu
and if you ever want to feel like a hen,

2181
02:00:33,730 --> 02:00:37,930
a wolf, that's, that's, it was
ridiculous. He's so strong.

2182
02:00:38,020 --> 02:00:40,510
He kicked the bag at one point
just lightly. I was holding it.

2183
02:00:40,511 --> 02:00:43,320
He was showing me around
house like a low kick it,

2184
02:00:43,390 --> 02:00:46,300
the power is retarded with that guy.
You know,

2185
02:00:46,301 --> 02:00:48,940
the beautiful thing about him is
when he throws things, he does it.

2186
02:00:48,970 --> 02:00:51,730
Everything is like tight and Tucker,
he's a,

2187
02:00:51,731 --> 02:00:54,940
he's got some of the best defense
as far as like MMA strikers.

2188
02:00:54,941 --> 02:00:58,360
He's got some of the best deal I can
tell and I spent enough time with him.

2189
02:00:58,361 --> 02:01:03,160
He's fucking smart guys doing everything.
Very technical.

2190
02:01:03,161 --> 02:01:05,350
He's very smart.
He's matured a lot.

2191
02:01:05,351 --> 02:01:08,480
He's 28 now and he was
just very open about what,

2192
02:01:08,490 --> 02:01:10,990
what a what a crazy fucker
he was when he was younger,

2193
02:01:10,991 --> 02:01:14,440
spending money going crazy and you see
his last fight against puppy a baby. No,

2194
02:01:14,530 --> 02:01:18,730
I tore the guy who was beautiful
because this guy's a monster man.

2195
02:01:18,910 --> 02:01:21,850
This patio Betty looks like the
last guy you'd ever want to fight.

2196
02:01:22,030 --> 02:01:24,880
You look at him,
he's just ridiculously shredded.

2197
02:01:24,881 --> 02:01:27,520
He's a judo black belt who can strike.

2198
02:01:27,521 --> 02:01:32,440
He's like a of very similar
to a shirker. No, no, no.

2199
02:01:32,441 --> 02:01:36,850
The Beltour Hector Lombard, very
similar to that. Bella toward champion.

2200
02:01:36,851 --> 02:01:40,220
Hector Lombard. Really similar.
Just build and ridiculous power

2201
02:01:40,220 --> 02:01:43,970
punches really fast and Tiago
just stayed in the pocket.

2202
02:01:43,971 --> 02:01:47,510
Managers caught him with a little shot
at the little shot leg kicks and the dude

2203
02:01:47,511 --> 02:01:50,450
was swinging it. Tiago man,
the dude was a scary guy,

2204
02:01:50,451 --> 02:01:55,250
but it was a beautiful display
of technique and patients
and being a veteran and

2205
02:01:55,251 --> 02:01:58,830
overcoming, I have be everybody
fights in the UFC, man,

2206
02:01:58,831 --> 02:02:00,560
that's a lot of fights and
that pappy a betting guy,

2207
02:02:00,561 --> 02:02:02,630
I feel like he could beat anybody.
I feel like if he just,

2208
02:02:02,660 --> 02:02:05,030
if you fuck up and let that
guy punched you in the face,

2209
02:02:05,280 --> 02:02:08,180
like if somehow or another you zig when
he should have zagged and you get caught,

2210
02:02:08,181 --> 02:02:11,090
which happens to guys. Well you saw
the John Fitch fight this weekend.

2211
02:02:11,360 --> 02:02:13,280
He got knocked out, knocked
out with one punch. Well,

2212
02:02:13,420 --> 02:02:14,730
you know there's a followup punch,

2213
02:02:14,750 --> 02:02:17,020
but essentially the one punch was
the one that really did it. Yeah.

2214
02:02:17,270 --> 02:02:20,000
Johnny Hendricks caught him and
he tried to come back from it.

2215
02:02:20,001 --> 02:02:22,340
You know we tried to, well with
those, with those little gloves,

2216
02:02:22,341 --> 02:02:25,880
your margin for error really
slims down and that's where,

2217
02:02:25,881 --> 02:02:29,990
that's where learning technique and if
you look at boxers when they teach you

2218
02:02:29,991 --> 02:02:32,600
you're, you're spending more time
avoiding them, throwing punches.

2219
02:02:32,700 --> 02:02:35,540
Anybody can throw hands but,
but moving out of the way and then,

2220
02:02:35,541 --> 02:02:40,160
and then hitting or just being able to
slip punches that tells us there's a lack

2221
02:02:40,161 --> 02:02:43,100
of like real high level technical boxing.

2222
02:02:43,160 --> 02:02:46,280
A lot of a lot of areas takes forever.

2223
02:02:46,310 --> 02:02:49,640
It takes forever and it's really
hard to learn everything. You know,

2224
02:02:49,670 --> 02:02:52,250
it's one of the reasons why a lot of
people think you should be awesome at one

2225
02:02:52,251 --> 02:02:54,980
thing before you ever got into MMA.
Cause you know,

2226
02:02:54,981 --> 02:02:58,490
it's like the Rory Mcdonald's of the
world are very rare and this is this young

2227
02:02:58,491 --> 02:03:00,980
kid who's starting out and he's
got great wrestling, is wrestling,

2228
02:03:00,981 --> 02:03:04,010
is outstanding kickboxing as
nasty as Jujitsu, solid as fuck.

2229
02:03:04,190 --> 02:03:06,650
He's really got no weaknesses.
But you know, he's,

2230
02:03:06,651 --> 02:03:09,910
he's one of those 22 year old
kids that can actually do that.

2231
02:03:10,050 --> 02:03:13,550
This came up with it from the, from the
get go, you know, for the most part,

2232
02:03:13,551 --> 02:03:16,490
most guys they came up with
one discipline or another.

2233
02:03:16,491 --> 02:03:19,730
And the best thing that could hope for
was to be really good at something.

2234
02:03:19,910 --> 02:03:20,960
But they're really good at wrestling.

2235
02:03:20,961 --> 02:03:22,950
So they'd take God down are
really good at striking.

2236
02:03:22,951 --> 02:03:25,670
You just learn how to sprawl.
Like Mirko Cro, cop, you know,

2237
02:03:25,671 --> 02:03:27,530
he never really became
anything other than a striker.

2238
02:03:27,560 --> 02:03:29,390
He has a couple of submission victories,

2239
02:03:29,580 --> 02:03:33,020
but they're mostly after he except the
random and fight mostly after he was

2240
02:03:33,021 --> 02:03:35,600
fucking a guy up the, uh, the question is,

2241
02:03:35,601 --> 02:03:38,660
can anybody beat John Bones Jones
and does he go to heavyweight? Sure.

2242
02:03:38,661 --> 02:03:39,530
Anybody can.
You know what?

2243
02:03:39,531 --> 02:03:42,680
Nobody ever expected the Jon Bones
Jones was ever going to exist. You know,

2244
02:03:42,681 --> 02:03:43,610
before he existed,

2245
02:03:43,611 --> 02:03:48,611
nobody would have suspected that some
brilliant young kid could come in here who

2246
02:03:48,621 --> 02:03:52,220
was a, an excellent amateur
wrestler with, you know,

2247
02:03:52,221 --> 02:03:55,190
a few years of karate and taekwondo
or something under his belt.

2248
02:03:55,191 --> 02:03:58,610
And maybe not even a few
years, I should say, like, you
know, months of it. But just,

2249
02:03:58,640 --> 02:03:58,971
you know,

2250
02:03:58,971 --> 02:04:01,880
practice some kicks and knew how to do
them and then you get him with some ace

2251
02:04:01,881 --> 02:04:06,650
trainers like Mike Winkeljohn and Greg
Jackson and they mold this kid into some

2252
02:04:06,651 --> 02:04:08,030
fucking prodigy.
I would,

2253
02:04:08,031 --> 02:04:10,460
I would've never said that could have
happened before that some kid could have

2254
02:04:10,461 --> 02:04:14,150
been in the game only like three years
and just dominate guys like shogun

2255
02:04:14,180 --> 02:04:17,810
dominate cause like Machida Yoel he
put machine at asleep with a standing

2256
02:04:17,850 --> 02:04:18,610
guillotine.

2257
02:04:18,610 --> 02:04:22,910
When's the last time anybody put on high
level champion to sleep with a standing

2258
02:04:22,911 --> 02:04:26,270
gate and then dropped him
like it was mortal Kombat.

2259
02:04:26,510 --> 02:04:31,100
Like he just beheaded him and shit. It was
like, Hey g, it's ridiculous. So he's a,

2260
02:04:31,101 --> 02:04:35,930
he's, you know what he is man. He is the
king of the new school. That's what he is.

2261
02:04:35,960 --> 02:04:39,120
Jon Jones is the king of the new school.
There's no one who can fuck with him.

2262
02:04:39,750 --> 02:04:42,060
You guys, there's a level,
there's a high level,

2263
02:04:42,061 --> 02:04:45,600
there's a higher level than has ever
existed before in Jon Jones is at the peak

2264
02:04:45,601 --> 02:04:47,340
of that junior dos Santos.

2265
02:04:48,390 --> 02:04:52,110
But there's another way of coming and
another way of coming as those Roy

2266
02:04:52,110 --> 02:04:53,220
McDonald dudes,
you know,

2267
02:04:53,250 --> 02:04:56,910
Jon Jones started out as a wrestler and
learned all that striking and slowly

2268
02:04:56,911 --> 02:05:00,330
become better at striking.
Rory Macdonald is great at everything.

2269
02:05:00,390 --> 02:05:04,320
He's great at everything. It's his fucking
head movement is nasty. It's striking,

2270
02:05:04,321 --> 02:05:07,650
it's clean, it's technique is
perfect. He got knockout power.

2271
02:05:07,800 --> 02:05:10,350
It's fucking 22 years old and he's
smart and he's a little savage.

2272
02:05:10,590 --> 02:05:12,090
Those guys are coming up and there's,

2273
02:05:12,150 --> 02:05:14,730
there's a 14 year old right now
that will probably fuck him up.

2274
02:05:14,940 --> 02:05:17,670
And that the guy that was hitting pads
in Vegas right now ever see those two

2275
02:05:17,671 --> 02:05:21,960
little kids, the little Mohawk kids
do. Those cool kids can do everything.

2276
02:05:22,260 --> 02:05:25,140
They're like little treats.
I don't know how they all now,

2277
02:05:25,141 --> 02:05:27,640
but they're super dedicated.
They love the sport, you know,

2278
02:05:27,660 --> 02:05:30,900
and they get a lot of attention. So they
do it a lot in their parents. Love it.

2279
02:05:30,901 --> 02:05:33,930
And come on man. That those kind
of guys, that's the next wave.

2280
02:05:34,350 --> 02:05:36,240
So as crazy as hoists,

2281
02:05:36,241 --> 02:05:41,241
Gracie was in 1993 John Jones is in 2012
and as crazy as Alistair Overeem is in

2282
02:05:42,931 --> 02:05:47,160
2012 you're going to have some new dude
that's going to be 10 years from now or

2283
02:05:47,161 --> 02:05:51,410
whatever and he's going to have some mad
distance between them because there'll

2284
02:05:51,420 --> 02:05:54,390
be a,
there'll be a sport as itself,

2285
02:05:54,570 --> 02:05:57,960
cause right now it's a sport
that's piecemealed from a
bunch of other different

2286
02:05:57,961 --> 02:06:00,230
sports, right. With no
clear formula. That's right.

2287
02:06:00,240 --> 02:06:02,130
Eventually they're going to
get a pretty clear for them.

2288
02:06:02,131 --> 02:06:05,250
Yet eventually there's going to be,
there's going to be, it seems MMA as a,

2289
02:06:05,280 --> 02:06:08,940
as its own fighting system is going to,
it's going to solidify most likely,

2290
02:06:09,300 --> 02:06:11,880
most likely boxing like,
yeah.

2291
02:06:12,030 --> 02:06:14,190
But part of the fun is the
ebb and flow in the battle.

2292
02:06:14,191 --> 02:06:16,800
Walt's happening all of a sudden,
karate is what everybody needs to know.

2293
02:06:16,860 --> 02:06:18,600
Nobody could touch Machinga oh shit.

2294
02:06:18,630 --> 02:06:21,510
Who would've ever thought it was karate
after all these years if you just have

2295
02:06:21,570 --> 02:06:23,160
the sprawling than it's karate.

2296
02:06:23,310 --> 02:06:26,990
And then you know a guy like
Jon Jones comes around and
I was like, oh no, no, no.

2297
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:30,540
It's length. It's distance and
intelligence in a wrestling background.

2298
02:06:30,541 --> 02:06:31,321
That's what's important.

2299
02:06:31,321 --> 02:06:33,990
And the willingness to believe in
yourself and just throw wild shit.

2300
02:06:34,170 --> 02:06:36,400
And the fact that nobody can hit you
because you're a mile away from them,

2301
02:06:36,710 --> 02:06:38,230
you connect on them.
What about,

2302
02:06:38,231 --> 02:06:41,370
what about him and junior desantis
will they fight? Maybe eventually.

2303
02:06:41,371 --> 02:06:44,610
I think Jon Jones was somewhat someday
be a heavyweight cause he's so young.

2304
02:06:44,940 --> 02:06:47,670
I think he's only 2,400 see what
weight does he walk around that?

2305
02:06:48,030 --> 02:06:50,160
That's a good question.
You know, I should ask him.

2306
02:06:50,161 --> 02:06:54,690
I think he's above two 15 to 20 I think
he gets pretty heavy and then he drops

2307
02:06:54,691 --> 02:06:56,040
the weight, you know, and eats healthy.

2308
02:06:56,041 --> 02:06:59,460
And I think he's got a big family and
I think it's, he's got big, you know,

2309
02:06:59,461 --> 02:07:03,490
I was young kid, he's going to fill
out, I think one professionally.

2310
02:07:03,580 --> 02:07:05,850
I think you'd be amazing as a
heavyweight too. He's big enough.

2311
02:07:05,851 --> 02:07:09,180
He's just got to skinny legs. Yeah. And
those could get bigger. And by the way,

2312
02:07:09,420 --> 02:07:11,880
he'd be even more ridiculous than could
you imagine if all of sudden you had

2313
02:07:11,881 --> 02:07:12,940
super legs underneath them.

2314
02:07:12,940 --> 02:07:17,770
We did all fucking squats and dead lifts
and just triangle the fuck out of my

2315
02:07:17,920 --> 02:07:19,980
gym. Imagine that evolves in
these triangling people. I mean,

2316
02:07:19,981 --> 02:07:23,910
he can do anything that's,
he's a guy you shouldn't,

2317
02:07:24,210 --> 02:07:27,840
I believe he's six, four, I believe.
Six, four really tall. He's really tall.

2318
02:07:27,841 --> 02:07:31,380
But his reach is what's ridiculous.
Yeah. But we'll pull that up, Brian.

2319
02:07:31,381 --> 02:07:35,710
Find out how tall John Jones, and by the
way, what is Anderson Silva Tall? Is He,

2320
02:07:36,250 --> 02:07:40,670
I think he's six too. That'd be great to
see that fight. Yeah. But you know, the,

2321
02:07:40,671 --> 02:07:44,950
the issue is a wrestling issue,
you know, I mean, he's, um,

2322
02:07:45,070 --> 02:07:49,540
Anderson Anderson is like, he's
an amazing, amazing fighter.

2323
02:07:49,810 --> 02:07:54,310
But when you're taking on a guy who was
physically much bigger than you, right.

2324
02:07:54,400 --> 02:07:58,060
He's Anderson is, well,
we ask him how tall he is.

2325
02:07:58,720 --> 02:08:00,850
Six foot four. Yeah.
He's got a six foot four,

2326
02:08:00,851 --> 02:08:05,080
but he has a reach that's bigger
than some seven foot tall people.

2327
02:08:05,530 --> 02:08:08,860
He's got a crazy reach. Yeah. I mean,
I just said that and that's real.

2328
02:08:09,070 --> 02:08:11,650
His reach is the longest
of anyone in the UFC,

2329
02:08:11,651 --> 02:08:14,110
including semi shelt who
used to fight for the UFC.

2330
02:08:14,290 --> 02:08:17,890
So his ability to touch you with his
hands is like right up there with Stephan

2331
02:08:17,891 --> 02:08:20,140
struve. Stephan skyscrapers. Struve has a,

2332
02:08:20,141 --> 02:08:24,280
I believe he has a shorter
wingspan than Jon Jones does.

2333
02:08:24,400 --> 02:08:27,730
So he's just got, he's got everything
going for him. He's got intelligence,

2334
02:08:27,850 --> 02:08:31,300
he's got confidence,
he's, he's got the, uh,

2335
02:08:31,330 --> 02:08:33,910
the courage to get in there and fucking
throw down against the best fighters in

2336
02:08:33,911 --> 02:08:37,120
the world even though he's only been
doing it for three years and he's got the

2337
02:08:37,121 --> 02:08:39,540
athleticism to pull it off and he listens
to everything. And then you're like,

2338
02:08:39,570 --> 02:08:42,610
you listen to like interviews with them
to do it is on youtube all the time.

2339
02:08:42,611 --> 02:08:46,600
Like watching wrestling
matches and learning moves
and putting them in his head.

2340
02:08:46,600 --> 02:08:50,670
He's a fucking, he's loving that. He's
the baddest mother. Tell me that, that,

2341
02:08:50,671 --> 02:08:52,570
that Anderson's,
I said what's interesting like,

2342
02:08:52,571 --> 02:08:55,320
and he said he's a martial arts nerd.
He loves martial arts.

2343
02:08:55,321 --> 02:08:57,040
He like watch his stuff.
Old Guys.

2344
02:08:57,130 --> 02:08:59,800
But you don't get as good as Anderson
unless you're completely obsessed with it.

2345
02:09:00,190 --> 02:09:02,810
You know, there's the story of
Anderson's fight with Tony Fryklund.

2346
02:09:02,811 --> 02:09:03,644
Did you know that story?
Yeah.

2347
02:09:03,850 --> 02:09:07,360
Anderson fought Tony fricken and he had
this crazy upward elbow that he wanted

2348
02:09:07,361 --> 02:09:11,890
to try like some shitty song and on Bach
moving and uh, his coaches were like,

2349
02:09:11,891 --> 02:09:13,390
we get the fuck out of
here with his elbow.

2350
02:09:13,560 --> 02:09:17,320
Like he kept practicing this really nutty
elbow that like would never come up.

2351
02:09:17,321 --> 02:09:19,750
It was like a Kung Fu move,
you know, it was like, I,

2352
02:09:19,950 --> 02:09:23,290
it was like some stuff that you saw in
a movie that you would never see in an

2353
02:09:23,291 --> 02:09:26,590
MMA fight where, you know, it's
much more dangerous. But, um,

2354
02:09:26,620 --> 02:09:31,620
he made his wife hold the Pellot forum
and he would practice this upward elbow.

2355
02:09:32,080 --> 02:09:35,350
They made his wife like hold pads and he
would practice this shit over and over

2356
02:09:35,351 --> 02:09:36,940
again.
He had to do it away from his coaches.

2357
02:09:37,270 --> 02:09:41,650
And so then he was like in in the the
actual cage and he like told his fucking

2358
02:09:41,651 --> 02:09:43,000
coach,
I'm going to do that upward elbow,

2359
02:09:43,001 --> 02:09:46,090
the league who shut the fuck up and get
out of here with this crazy upward elbow.

2360
02:09:46,091 --> 02:09:50,680
And Bob Blam, he catches Frickin with
this upward elbow and puts them to sleep.

2361
02:09:50,740 --> 02:09:54,500
Not just put them asleep but stiff
armed them who went down like stiff leg,

2362
02:09:54,501 --> 02:09:55,360
stiff on nothing,

2363
02:09:55,361 --> 02:09:58,420
was working and he blessed them with an
elbow and then Anderson just walks away

2364
02:09:58,421 --> 02:10:02,170
like he's a Ninja.
It was the most ridiculous shit ever.

2365
02:10:02,620 --> 02:10:03,760
But that's what it is.
He like,

2366
02:10:03,761 --> 02:10:07,060
he learned a technique that
was outside of his discipline.

2367
02:10:07,210 --> 02:10:11,860
He's just such a bad motherfucker.
What he's got is just like John Jones,

2368
02:10:11,861 --> 02:10:15,280
he's very intelligent and
his timing is amazing.

2369
02:10:15,281 --> 02:10:19,630
And his confidence and intelligence,
timing, confidence and character.

2370
02:10:19,840 --> 02:10:23,320
And with Anderson to Anderson is
a guy who's been proven. I mean,

2371
02:10:23,680 --> 02:10:28,000
Jon Jones has never been in a fight where
he got dominated for four rounds and

2372
02:10:28,001 --> 02:10:30,010
then pull it off in the fifth you know,
there's,

2373
02:10:30,070 --> 02:10:33,130
there's something invaluable about
what Anderson has accomplished.

2374
02:10:33,380 --> 02:10:36,020
And the Wood Anderson showed them that
shell son and fight was that he's not

2375
02:10:36,021 --> 02:10:39,920
just the hammer, that, you know, he can,
he can take it, dude, you can't break him.

2376
02:10:40,040 --> 02:10:43,850
And if you slip, yeah, he's looking for,

2377
02:10:44,120 --> 02:10:47,000
he's looking for a way to win, man.
And if you slip, he's going to find it.

2378
02:10:47,130 --> 02:10:51,290
Guess what? Yeah. It's only unmet need
to go, but look at this. What's, this?

2379
02:10:51,291 --> 02:10:53,960
Could not believe that bitch.
Yeah.

2380
02:10:53,961 --> 02:10:58,280
I mean he just did what he had to do and
one came in, they're injured, you know?

2381
02:10:58,310 --> 02:11:01,780
Oh, is that what it was? Oh yeah, he
edited it. He had a rib issue out of it.

2382
02:11:01,940 --> 02:11:04,400
Well that's why he let him take him
down. You know? He's like, you know,

2383
02:11:04,401 --> 02:11:05,660
I could stand up but this guy,

2384
02:11:06,060 --> 02:11:10,670
or I could just fucking barley fight
off the take downs. Interesting.

2385
02:11:11,060 --> 02:11:11,990
Yeah.
If you can't take them now,

2386
02:11:11,991 --> 02:11:15,860
but Chelsea and has the best
double in the sport. His running,

2387
02:11:15,861 --> 02:11:19,220
charging double dude,
he just takes motherfuckers down.

2388
02:11:19,310 --> 02:11:21,290
Even if Anderson was like fully healthy,

2389
02:11:21,291 --> 02:11:23,300
I don't know if he could stop
that guy from taking them down.

2390
02:11:23,480 --> 02:11:24,810
A lot of people don't know she does.

2391
02:11:24,811 --> 02:11:27,800
The thing about shell son and dude is
Chelsea and the one who's right and right

2392
02:11:27,801 --> 02:11:32,720
now he's right. He's one of
the best on the planet. Dude,
that wrestling is insane.

2393
02:11:32,870 --> 02:11:36,050
His top position is
boxing is fucking good.

2394
02:11:36,051 --> 02:11:39,020
When he caught Anderson with that
straight left and wobbled him, look,

2395
02:11:39,021 --> 02:11:40,340
I don't give a fuck what you say.

2396
02:11:40,370 --> 02:11:42,230
That's got to put some
thoughts into a guy's head.

2397
02:11:42,320 --> 02:11:46,430
You've got to guard charges at you.
Throws fucking clean, crisp punches,

2398
02:11:46,480 --> 02:11:50,090
different can take a shot and
his wrestling's ridiculous.

2399
02:11:50,091 --> 02:11:53,850
And now after the Brian Stann fight,
oh, he's strangling people too.

2400
02:11:53,920 --> 02:11:58,170
And now we started submitting people.
Jesus Christ. And you got to tell you,

2401
02:11:58,180 --> 02:12:00,670
you want to talk about a guy
talking shit fucking with your head.

2402
02:12:00,680 --> 02:12:02,010
[inaudible] he's the best ever.

2403
02:12:02,540 --> 02:12:06,650
The grain white said he's the best
since Muhammad Ali. I, you know,

2404
02:12:06,680 --> 02:12:09,380
Muhammad Ali was in a
different world because he was,

2405
02:12:09,470 --> 02:12:10,910
he had a different flavor to them.

2406
02:12:10,911 --> 02:12:14,300
It was like a ridiculousness to which
chill sort of has a little bit of a

2407
02:12:14,301 --> 02:12:16,760
ridiculous to him. But God
damn, that dude's funny.

2408
02:12:16,790 --> 02:12:19,070
He's hilarious and he's so prolific.
He's amazing.

2409
02:12:19,071 --> 02:12:20,810
He's always coming up with
new ridiculous shit to say.

2410
02:12:22,120 --> 02:12:25,430
I wish they didn't hate him so much in
Brazil because he said a lot of crazy

2411
02:12:25,431 --> 02:12:29,900
shit. I know, I know, I know, I know. And
you know what he probably mean. Whatever.

2412
02:12:29,901 --> 02:12:32,990
I shouldn't say you probably shouldn't
have done that, but now he can, you know,

2413
02:12:33,190 --> 02:12:36,470
if he went there, I mean it would
probably suck for him everywhere he goes.

2414
02:12:36,471 --> 02:12:37,820
People be screaming and yelling at him.

2415
02:12:37,821 --> 02:12:41,150
If he has balls ballsy enough to
actually fight you gonna fight.

2416
02:12:41,690 --> 02:12:44,510
Is he going to finance itself as I can
be on the boat? Who knows? He says, no,

2417
02:12:44,511 --> 02:12:47,720
he said that he's got a, an
announcement and he said, uh,

2418
02:12:47,750 --> 02:12:51,470
my next move after Mark Munoz,
what he said was, I don't know,

2419
02:12:51,471 --> 02:12:54,020
but if I was a George
Saint Pierre or John Jones,

2420
02:12:54,230 --> 02:12:58,910
I'd take a real deep gulp right about now,
chill son and said that.

2421
02:12:59,210 --> 02:13:00,040
So He's,

2422
02:13:00,040 --> 02:13:04,730
he's insinuating that he will want to
fight Jon Jones or George Saint Pierre and

2423
02:13:04,910 --> 02:13:09,260
since her real gold right now he's,

2424
02:13:09,270 --> 02:13:13,670
he's a hilarious showmen and since
George just had knee surgery and he had

2425
02:13:13,671 --> 02:13:15,800
patella tendon graft,
knee surgery,

2426
02:13:15,801 --> 02:13:19,100
which is particularly difficult
to come back from, not difficult,

2427
02:13:19,101 --> 02:13:23,140
but time consuming because you have,
well you have, yeah. You know, it's,

2428
02:13:23,141 --> 02:13:24,680
it's a little more,
I mean differ.

2429
02:13:24,681 --> 02:13:27,710
Every doctor has their own philosophy
and doctors have their own specialty,

2430
02:13:27,711 --> 02:13:31,650
but some doctors don't like to do it
that way because they believe that it

2431
02:13:31,651 --> 02:13:32,460
compromises

2432
02:13:32,460 --> 02:13:35,790
the strength of the patella tendon and
it makes a knee a little bit wigglier.

2433
02:13:35,970 --> 02:13:40,500
I have both. I had this one done. My
left knee was done. Patella tendon graft.

2434
02:13:40,501 --> 02:13:43,560
My right knee was done with a cadaver
and the right knee came out way better.

2435
02:13:43,770 --> 02:13:45,720
Maybe it was a better doctor.
That's very possible.

2436
02:13:45,721 --> 02:13:49,620
But the God that I did in New York was
a top notch guy that did like New York

2437
02:13:49,621 --> 02:13:52,470
Knicks and did basketball teams and shit.
He was supposed to be really good,

2438
02:13:52,770 --> 02:13:56,130
but it took a long time before
that knee felt right. Again,

2439
02:13:56,190 --> 02:13:59,100
this is my right knee would
felt great in like a few months,

2440
02:13:59,370 --> 02:14:02,610
like four or five months. My
right knee was fine. My left knee,

2441
02:14:02,670 --> 02:14:04,410
well Noah did surgery is very different.

2442
02:14:04,411 --> 02:14:07,140
They take a chunk out of your
bone and they slice your tendon.

2443
02:14:07,260 --> 02:14:10,260
They'd take a strip of that tendon
and a chunk out of your Shin Bone.

2444
02:14:10,410 --> 02:14:14,760
So they pull it off intact and one thing
and then they open you up and screw

2445
02:14:14,761 --> 02:14:19,761
that in place and that becomes
your new ACL and he tore his ACL.

2446
02:14:20,210 --> 02:14:23,210
Yeah, yeah, yeah. He tore
it. He tore a training.

2447
02:14:23,220 --> 02:14:26,760
He heard it and then he had to pull out
the Nick Diaz fight or the Carlos condit

2448
02:14:26,761 --> 02:14:28,530
fight, whichever fight it
was at that point in time.

2449
02:14:28,531 --> 02:14:30,870
I believe it was Carlos Condit.
Yeah, it was Carlos Condit.

2450
02:14:30,871 --> 02:14:34,680
He pulled out of that fight and then I
would have loved to have seen that Nick

2451
02:14:34,680 --> 02:14:37,290
Diaz. Uh, yeah. Well he
kept trying to train.

2452
02:14:37,291 --> 02:14:40,080
I guess that's really what fucks you up.
You know,

2453
02:14:40,110 --> 02:14:43,050
I have a little back injury
and this little Mussel Pole,

2454
02:14:43,051 --> 02:14:45,000
it's where my floating rib head is.

2455
02:14:45,270 --> 02:14:48,240
It's like we're connects to
like where your scapulas. Yeah,

2456
02:14:48,360 --> 02:14:50,640
it's been a fucking pain in my
ass for like a couple of months.

2457
02:14:50,641 --> 02:14:53,710
And the reason being because it
was hurting me and I said, oh,

2458
02:14:53,720 --> 02:14:54,990
I'll just go and roll light.

2459
02:14:55,440 --> 02:14:58,320
And that's when you do like when
you have an injury you have to,

2460
02:14:58,321 --> 02:15:01,620
it's like driving your car with a
flat tire. Like yeah, just go slow.

2461
02:15:01,890 --> 02:15:05,610
Like you gotta be Super Smart in
combat sports when you have an injury.

2462
02:15:05,820 --> 02:15:06,930
And George hurt his knee.

2463
02:15:06,931 --> 02:15:09,360
He had to pull out the fight and then
he tried training again too soon.

2464
02:15:09,361 --> 02:15:13,020
And then he blew it and then it exploded
on him. You know, you, you know,

2465
02:15:13,050 --> 02:15:17,010
it just lost the ACL and
that's what happens a lot of
times. You have like small,

2466
02:15:17,100 --> 02:15:18,570
you do damage to the knee,

2467
02:15:18,720 --> 02:15:21,120
the knee will be compromised and
week and then you heard it again.

2468
02:15:21,150 --> 02:15:23,070
That's exactly what happened to me.
In fact,

2469
02:15:23,071 --> 02:15:26,940
on my first knee surgery and the four hour
body, that's why it says that Soviets,

2470
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:28,950
the Soviets,
coaches as well as guys don't they?

2471
02:15:28,951 --> 02:15:31,560
The way they get you conditioned
for an Olympic condition,

2472
02:15:31,561 --> 02:15:35,190
they make you walk really fast for 15
minutes and every day you have to cover

2473
02:15:35,191 --> 02:15:39,780
more ground. So walking is your
aerobic exercise and if you walk speed,

2474
02:15:39,781 --> 02:15:42,210
walk for 15 minutes as fast as you can,

2475
02:15:42,510 --> 02:15:45,170
you'll get in the best shape of your life,
especially if you do it uphill.

2476
02:15:45,270 --> 02:15:46,710
That's hilarious.
That's a great idea.

2477
02:15:47,070 --> 02:15:52,070
Fucking if you get on a treadmill and put
it at four miles an hour at 15 degrees

2478
02:15:52,531 --> 02:15:56,250
incline at 50 at 58 the highest inclined.
Just try that shit sometime.

2479
02:15:56,430 --> 02:15:59,640
Try Walking for four miles an
hour and at for 15 minutes.

2480
02:15:59,690 --> 02:16:02,740
[inaudible] had a great article
on his website about, uh,

2481
02:16:02,840 --> 02:16:07,710
in intelligence and efficiency over
overtraining and how important it is to

2482
02:16:07,711 --> 02:16:10,830
build up real
undertrained.

2483
02:16:10,860 --> 02:16:13,860
What they found is that Dan Gable and
those American masters overtrained,

2484
02:16:14,280 --> 02:16:17,700
what happens is you get
injuries later on that stuff.

2485
02:16:17,760 --> 02:16:21,510
They have unstoppable mental
strength because of it. Of course,

2486
02:16:21,540 --> 02:16:25,100
their ability to dominate competition,
the ability to there, you know,

2487
02:16:25,110 --> 02:16:29,440
no one has more mental strength in combat,
then they're,

2488
02:16:29,441 --> 02:16:33,610
they're on another level. Man Readiness.
I went to, Dan gave us camp for two weeks.

2489
02:16:33,611 --> 02:16:36,820
I remember and not realizing if this
is what it takes to train in college.

2490
02:16:36,821 --> 02:16:38,860
I don't want to fucking be a
college wrestler. This is this.

2491
02:16:38,960 --> 02:16:42,280
I don't want to get up and sprint for an
hour in the morning. I was like, this,

2492
02:16:42,290 --> 02:16:45,010
this, I was 17. I was
like, fuck this. I did it.

2493
02:16:45,370 --> 02:16:48,680
Then I came back my senior year and did
pretty fucking well just cause I had

2494
02:16:48,700 --> 02:16:50,050
been in Iowa.
But yeah,

2495
02:16:50,051 --> 02:16:54,520
it was one of the reasons I quit wrestling
over a taekwondo when I was in high

2496
02:16:54,521 --> 02:16:54,751
school.

2497
02:16:54,751 --> 02:16:59,050
I was doing wrestling and taekwondo
and wrestling made me so fucking tired.

2498
02:16:59,320 --> 02:17:02,500
I remember have the first
day after practice we ran
stadium stairs or something

2499
02:17:02,501 --> 02:17:05,080
like that.
The first after practice I couldn't walk.

2500
02:17:05,081 --> 02:17:06,370
I was like walking in the hallways.

2501
02:17:06,371 --> 02:17:10,870
I would have to like stop for a second
and like massage my upper thighs and then

2502
02:17:10,871 --> 02:17:12,100
walk again.
Matches,

2503
02:17:12,101 --> 02:17:15,400
matches sometimes masters to go over
time and an extra three minutes.

2504
02:17:15,760 --> 02:17:18,170
You thought you were going to fucking die.
I'll never forget that.

2505
02:17:18,190 --> 02:17:19,690
That that is a young man.
When you,

2506
02:17:19,691 --> 02:17:24,280
when you wrestle like you know I wrestled
pretty, you know, it was my sport.

2507
02:17:24,850 --> 02:17:26,510
You never that,

2508
02:17:26,511 --> 02:17:29,890
that fear of going walking on that and
mat against somebody you don't know when

2509
02:17:29,891 --> 02:17:34,600
you're 14 1516 1718 yeah.
It does change you.

2510
02:17:34,710 --> 02:17:39,250
It really does force you even any
sport and he's just playing basketball.

2511
02:17:39,251 --> 02:17:42,460
Anything we have to step up when
you're alone for cultural sports,

2512
02:17:42,461 --> 02:17:45,730
when you were alone, it's a lonely
place on that mat. It is definitely,

2513
02:17:45,731 --> 02:17:49,900
I think more troubling or more more a
taxing and more testing of your character

2514
02:17:49,901 --> 02:17:52,960
and to go to Iowa. To this
intensive wrestling cabin. It,

2515
02:17:52,961 --> 02:17:54,130
Dan's gable and you're around,

2516
02:17:54,160 --> 02:17:57,120
all these all have a Midwestern
animals and you're like, holy,

2517
02:17:57,121 --> 02:18:00,240
you're ready to dedicate every
wrestling. Why is that? 17,

2518
02:18:00,260 --> 02:18:02,520
I'll have a fucking mustache.
You know,

2519
02:18:03,190 --> 02:18:05,080
one of the first times I
ever saw Matt Hughes fights,

2520
02:18:05,200 --> 02:18:07,620
I remember thinking like
this back when he used to,

2521
02:18:07,630 --> 02:18:10,510
they used to let them wear wrestling
shoes. Okay, good luck. Good luck.

2522
02:18:10,990 --> 02:18:13,240
Good luck stopping that shot
with his red wrestling shoes.

2523
02:18:13,490 --> 02:18:18,190
I got so fucking God told me he was
the strongest guy he'd ever, Russell.

2524
02:18:18,191 --> 02:18:22,810
He said Matt Hughes was the
strongest person I'd ever,
oh, I believe it. You know,

2525
02:18:22,811 --> 02:18:25,840
Matt Hughes tapped out
fucking Brock Lesnar when they
were training together. No,

2526
02:18:26,850 --> 02:18:29,500
dude, he's a black belt level
Brazilian Jiu Jitsu artists. He just,

2527
02:18:29,710 --> 02:18:30,230
you know what I mean?

2528
02:18:30,230 --> 02:18:33,430
He learned everything from like Jeremy
Horn and from MMA classes and you know,

2529
02:18:33,431 --> 02:18:36,370
catch wrestling. He does a lot
of wrestling submissions too.

2530
02:18:36,371 --> 02:18:40,210
Like the one he put Ricardo Almeida with,
he put them out. Remember that Ricardo?

2531
02:18:40,211 --> 02:18:43,500
Uh, he got him in that, um, uh, the, um,

2532
02:18:43,960 --> 02:18:47,970
it was the Schultz headlock and he just
fucking cranked it down to the beautiful

2533
02:18:47,971 --> 02:18:50,530
and put them out, you know,
and made it even know.

2534
02:18:50,770 --> 02:18:54,120
He didn't even know he's in danger. He
didn't even freak outs, you know. Yeah.

2535
02:18:54,220 --> 02:18:55,030
It's ridiculous.

2536
02:18:55,030 --> 02:18:58,870
So I remember watching when he first
started fighting in the UFC and I'm just

2537
02:18:58,871 --> 02:19:01,960
like, man, these guys are common
man. I always knew they were around.

2538
02:19:02,170 --> 02:19:04,920
I always knew from my time in wrestling,
there was always guys that would,

2539
02:19:04,980 --> 02:19:06,460
we would go to the states and,
you know,

2540
02:19:06,461 --> 02:19:10,600
watch like the best guys in the states
go out of the division champions so fast

2541
02:19:10,601 --> 02:19:15,030
and so and just so flexible. Yeah. The kid
in our, um, we had a kid in our, um, our,

2542
02:19:15,100 --> 02:19:18,310
our, when I was a sophomore, when
I was a sophomore in high school,

2543
02:19:18,311 --> 02:19:22,900
we had one kid that was in like national
level. It's a who smoked cigarettes too,

2544
02:19:22,901 --> 02:19:26,410
by the way. Mark Collins. And
he was a great fucking car,

2545
02:19:26,411 --> 02:19:30,470
like a really passionate dude.
And I remember one time, uh, uh,

2546
02:19:30,530 --> 02:19:33,920
believe the coach's name was Hurwitz. I
believe that was, it was her wits end. Uh,

2547
02:19:33,940 --> 02:19:37,700
the other guy was, fuck the Irish,
fuck, I can't remember his name,

2548
02:19:39,860 --> 02:19:40,460
but hold on,

2549
02:19:40,460 --> 02:19:45,460
Hook this mark calling guy would have
this fucking crazy practice and everybody

2550
02:19:45,471 --> 02:19:46,630
would be dying.

2551
02:19:46,730 --> 02:19:50,420
Hands on their knees and calling would
run across the fucking room and slide

2552
02:19:50,421 --> 02:19:53,710
down on his knees and go, come on, let's
go. Who's next? And just wanted to,

2553
02:19:53,730 --> 02:19:55,910
wanted to keep wrestling learned,
keep going, want to keep drilling.

2554
02:19:55,911 --> 02:19:57,320
And the coach pointed at him and he goes,

2555
02:19:57,680 --> 02:20:01,510
there's guys like that in every
weight class. He goes, get,

2556
02:20:01,520 --> 02:20:04,310
you better get that in your head. There's
guys like that in every weight class.

2557
02:20:04,580 --> 02:20:08,780
And I remember realizing myself, you know,
being 14 years old or whatever I was,

2558
02:20:08,781 --> 02:20:10,550
you know,
it was either 14 or 15,

2559
02:20:10,820 --> 02:20:15,230
and I was looking at him and I was killing
my God like this. Yeah, you gotta know,

2560
02:20:15,260 --> 02:20:17,900
you gotta know that there's dudes out
there that are willing to take it like

2561
02:20:17,901 --> 02:20:20,720
that. They're willing to
go that far. Coach Murphy,

2562
02:20:20,721 --> 02:20:23,300
that was the Irish guy and Murphy was
always trying to get me to play football.

2563
02:20:23,301 --> 02:20:26,190
I'm like, bitch, are you
crazy? I am a small person.

2564
02:20:26,850 --> 02:20:29,840
There's a dude on our wrestling
team that was also playing football.

2565
02:20:29,841 --> 02:20:33,770
His name was Bob Baker.
He was 300 fucking pounds in high school.

2566
02:20:35,330 --> 02:20:39,470
I wrestled one 34 I don't want
to lose this fucking giant dude.

2567
02:20:39,560 --> 02:20:42,950
Someone on another squash on top of me.
Fuck that man.

2568
02:20:43,760 --> 02:20:47,990
Oh my God to for one season.
I was so afraid.

2569
02:20:47,991 --> 02:20:51,620
I just seeing these huge guys run
at me. I was like, I'm so dangerous.

2570
02:20:51,621 --> 02:20:54,980
Man has made a paper. It's such
as such a dangerous sport. I mean,

2571
02:20:54,981 --> 02:20:57,400
people love it and everything now,
but charging into guys.

2572
02:20:58,840 --> 02:21:02,110
My 14 year old who I've
worked here on nephew is,

2573
02:21:02,130 --> 02:21:06,980
is 185 pounds and he's six foot
one and he squats to 85 for reps.

2574
02:21:06,981 --> 02:21:10,520
Okay. He's 14 and he's a giant Jesus and
he plays football and I watched that.

2575
02:21:10,521 --> 02:21:13,550
I watched him play Jv.
He's only 14 and I watched,

2576
02:21:13,610 --> 02:21:15,890
I watched those kids hit
each other and I was like,

2577
02:21:16,280 --> 02:21:18,500
nobody's heads built for this.
I told his dad, I go, look,

2578
02:21:18,501 --> 02:21:19,660
he's a monster and amount of there,

2579
02:21:19,661 --> 02:21:21,830
get him out of there and get a good
amount of it in a minute fighting and he

2580
02:21:21,831 --> 02:21:23,330
plays guitar.
Let him play guitar.

2581
02:21:23,390 --> 02:21:27,290
They don't even know how bad the
damage is until these guys die. Yeah.

2582
02:21:27,300 --> 02:21:29,890
You remember that guy that fell off of
his back of his girls? His truck had it.

2583
02:21:29,891 --> 02:21:33,740
He had an old man's brain and an old man's
like rotten brain and it showed like,

2584
02:21:33,870 --> 02:21:37,810
you know all this degeneration 23 or
something. I think he was 25 but yeah,

2585
02:21:37,850 --> 02:21:42,060
close enough. I mean it's insane. These
guys have been doing this device school.

2586
02:21:42,710 --> 02:21:45,940
Exactly. It's not even a
layman alignment or or running.

2587
02:21:46,010 --> 02:21:48,680
I have a friend who was an alignment and
he said back in the day when he was to

2588
02:21:48,681 --> 02:21:50,270
play in college,
he,

2589
02:21:50,340 --> 02:21:54,200
they didn't allow you to use your
hands so you couldn't push guys.

2590
02:21:54,380 --> 02:21:58,150
You would slam head to head with guys.
Is that true? Does that make any sense?

2591
02:21:58,170 --> 02:21:59,870
Use Your hands.
You always use your hands always.

2592
02:22:00,890 --> 02:22:03,710
Is there anything different than what
you couldn't cause he was telling me that

2593
02:22:04,200 --> 02:22:08,420
the pig gets spiked guys in the chest
with the big difference is that now in

2594
02:22:08,421 --> 02:22:12,410
football you can't have a helmet to helmet
contact. You can't do it deliberately.

2595
02:22:12,590 --> 02:22:13,550
So if you hit somebody,

2596
02:22:13,551 --> 02:22:16,880
you tackle somebody and a lot of guys
just to run at you and they'd hit you with

2597
02:22:16,881 --> 02:22:20,420
their helmet and you always allowed to
use your hands and push guys where you

2598
02:22:20,421 --> 02:22:23,690
will have to do, you have to unblock
them on the line. You can use your hands.

2599
02:22:23,691 --> 02:22:26,670
But yeah, you typically held your
hands this way. But what are the rules?

2600
02:22:26,671 --> 02:22:30,390
Can you grab a guy and fucking on Juno
is asking me about office all offense.

2601
02:22:30,391 --> 02:22:34,710
You cannot do that on defense. Kenyon,
you know, holding on offense and defense.

2602
02:22:34,711 --> 02:22:37,290
Offense, you can grab and move.
You can pull people out of the way.

2603
02:22:37,291 --> 02:22:41,310
So on defensive of dudes coming at
you can judo his ass. Yes. Really?

2604
02:22:41,340 --> 02:22:43,400
You can grab his clothes and
fucking hip toss on. Yeah.

2605
02:22:43,401 --> 02:22:45,720
But it's really hard to do. Cause those
guys know what the fuck they're doing.

2606
02:22:45,750 --> 02:22:46,930
Yeah, no shit. Right? Yeah.

2607
02:22:46,970 --> 02:22:49,530
That's one of the craziest thing is
when you see some nutty running back,

2608
02:22:49,531 --> 02:22:52,890
one of those fucking freaks,
one of those incredible specimens.

2609
02:22:53,040 --> 02:22:55,920
And I remember this one where Peterson
dudes were trying to get ahold of them

2610
02:22:55,921 --> 02:22:59,600
and he's spinning. He keeps
spinning. Adrian Peterson
tried to grab a hold of me.

2611
02:22:59,601 --> 02:23:03,030
He just spins out of their
hands. Oh Adrian Peterson
sprinting with a shirt off.

2612
02:23:03,031 --> 02:23:04,440
There's like a,
there's I've commercial.

2613
02:23:04,680 --> 02:23:08,250
And just take a look at the
physicality is a guy who was so fast,

2614
02:23:08,251 --> 02:23:13,080
he runs I think 27 miles an
hour or something like 20
what is the human athlete

2615
02:23:13,081 --> 02:23:16,620
going to look like a hundred years from
now? A lot of things going on like,

2616
02:23:16,860 --> 02:23:19,380
like Venus and Serena Williams.
Okay,

2617
02:23:19,410 --> 02:23:21,450
they're going to have sex and
they're gonna make a baby.

2618
02:23:21,670 --> 02:23:25,170
And I can only hope they have sex with
some Olympic athlete motherfucker.

2619
02:23:25,171 --> 02:23:26,190
And we see what's possible.

2620
02:23:26,540 --> 02:23:29,820
And everybody just keeps doing that
until the point where that just becomes,

2621
02:23:30,030 --> 02:23:30,631
you know, the, the,

2622
02:23:30,631 --> 02:23:34,920
the number one seed on the planet earth
and just see what is possible with this

2623
02:23:34,921 --> 02:23:37,230
human form. I got to come to that
because we're going to have two things.

2624
02:23:37,230 --> 02:23:40,200
You're going to have training methods
of course, and nutrition and all that.

2625
02:23:40,201 --> 02:23:42,700
Nano bots and shit.
Genetic engineering. Yeah.

2626
02:23:42,780 --> 02:23:45,420
Science is going to step in and
take care of everything that nature,

2627
02:23:45,990 --> 02:23:49,140
manipulation, myostatin
inhibitors, all those things.

2628
02:23:49,141 --> 02:23:53,760
If we think that you know that the stock
market crash is a wake up call, wait,

2629
02:23:53,761 --> 02:23:57,300
so the genetic crash comes, have 400
pound linemen, 500 pound linemen.

2630
02:23:57,330 --> 02:23:59,280
We're going to have to fucking
women that are 10 feet tall,

2631
02:23:59,281 --> 02:24:01,240
squashing men on the head.
Dad Way.

2632
02:24:01,440 --> 02:24:05,280
Could you imagine if some woman became
a like a mad crazy man hater and they

2633
02:24:05,281 --> 02:24:07,900
genetically engineered a way for her
to be like a check of the giants?

2634
02:24:07,930 --> 02:24:10,860
How big giant. It's huge.
What are you gonna do?

2635
02:24:10,861 --> 02:24:12,050
Are you going to fuck around with you,
Tanya?

2636
02:24:13,230 --> 02:24:16,110
She's going to use you like a Dildo and
just grab you by your little ass hole

2637
02:24:16,111 --> 02:24:18,560
and stuff. You inside her pussy. I
do imagine if there was like some,

2638
02:24:18,600 --> 02:24:21,720
if you could just decide I want to be a
10 foot tall woman because men have been

2639
02:24:21,721 --> 02:24:22,261
fucking with me.

2640
02:24:22,261 --> 02:24:25,630
I'm just going to walk around and kicking
guys and the ball and shove them with

2641
02:24:25,760 --> 02:24:27,930
other animals.
Your genetic structure with other animals.

2642
02:24:27,931 --> 02:24:28,641
That's what's interesting.

2643
02:24:28,641 --> 02:24:33,180
The idea is can you stop that technology
from getting to that point and can you

2644
02:24:33,181 --> 02:24:36,300
keep it out of the hands of a person
who would use it for a terrible thing?

2645
02:24:36,440 --> 02:24:39,270
Probably not. Probably not. Right. You
think everything will look at this.

2646
02:24:39,420 --> 02:24:42,600
I mean there's laptops that were,
we use just your phone.

2647
02:24:42,601 --> 02:24:46,470
Your phone has like so much more power
than anything that existed in the 1960s

2648
02:24:46,770 --> 02:24:48,450
but everybody's going
to have access to it.

2649
02:24:48,451 --> 02:24:50,790
So everything is going to come
up together just like computers.

2650
02:24:51,050 --> 02:24:54,000
But will there come a time where we have
to stop people from becoming 10 foot

2651
02:24:54,001 --> 02:24:57,570
tall attack of the giant women's
stomping on dudes and shit? I mean,

2652
02:24:57,571 --> 02:25:02,100
what could you imagine if there the
manipulation of actual physical life,

2653
02:25:02,250 --> 02:25:05,550
if it actually gets to a point where you
can design what you want to look like

2654
02:25:05,670 --> 02:25:07,170
and like you can say, mom, Dad,

2655
02:25:07,171 --> 02:25:10,530
I've decided to be one of the blue people
from Avatar and you just decided the

2656
02:25:10,531 --> 02:25:11,940
Pentagon is definitely the thing.

2657
02:25:12,260 --> 02:25:14,190
Trying to figure out ways
to create super soldiers,

2658
02:25:14,191 --> 02:25:17,700
whether it's a cloning or
tissue regeneration and yeah,

2659
02:25:17,701 --> 02:25:19,800
but I mean what if I forgot
about super soldiers?

2660
02:25:19,801 --> 02:25:21,330
How about things that don't even exist?

2661
02:25:21,450 --> 02:25:23,710
You can make things that you
could become a dragon. You know,

2662
02:25:23,711 --> 02:25:27,490
like I want to be a dragon. That's what,
that's what Craig Venter, Craig Venter,

2663
02:25:28,000 --> 02:25:31,850
the guy who created that synthetic
biology quick vendors team that the

2664
02:25:31,870 --> 02:25:35,710
implications are 21 years. Is
this the guy who created um, um,

2665
02:25:35,890 --> 02:25:38,260
it's made out of metal or
is he the guy who so poor?

2666
02:25:38,670 --> 02:25:43,600
Basically I'm a synthetic form of
bacteria. That was, that was basically,

2667
02:25:43,601 --> 02:25:47,500
it's a host genetic blueprint was created
on a computer. It's synthetic biology.

2668
02:25:47,790 --> 02:25:52,090
And, and the idea is that anything you
can conceive of a human being can make.

2669
02:25:52,300 --> 02:25:55,960
Do you know that scientists have been able
to grow sperm and the laboratory dish?

2670
02:25:55,990 --> 02:26:00,070
Yes, I do. Your time was up, son. I
know our time on this planet as men,

2671
02:26:00,071 --> 02:26:01,180
we will no longer be useful.

2672
02:26:01,250 --> 02:26:05,760
Just that biology is going to be an
antiquated and antiquated machine

2673
02:26:07,270 --> 02:26:08,850
controlled by technology.

2674
02:26:08,870 --> 02:26:12,640
It's going to be some mad rush to see
who can dominate whatever aspect of this

2675
02:26:12,641 --> 02:26:13,780
new reality comes up.

2676
02:26:14,050 --> 02:26:17,080
Because if there's no morality and there's
no humans that are in control of it,

2677
02:26:17,081 --> 02:26:19,780
clearly it's going to get to a point
where it's gonna. It's gonna be wild,

2678
02:26:19,781 --> 02:26:21,400
wild west for genetic manipulation.

2679
02:26:21,570 --> 02:26:23,800
But also the idea is that if
you're going to live that long,

2680
02:26:23,801 --> 02:26:25,240
what does that say about
your earning power?

2681
02:26:25,241 --> 02:26:28,140
You've got to make a lot of fucking
money for a long time. You know,

2682
02:26:28,240 --> 02:26:30,610
you know that a Apple's got, you
know, we're not going to be able to,

2683
02:26:30,611 --> 02:26:33,280
we're not going to need to charge our
phones anymore. They have flow cells.

2684
02:26:34,090 --> 02:26:34,700
They have the patch.

2685
02:26:34,700 --> 02:26:37,850
It's going to blow up on your patent from
fuel cells and every two weeks you'll

2686
02:26:37,851 --> 02:26:42,130
take an action. Cautious ago.
Check. That'd be set for two weeks.

2687
02:26:42,190 --> 02:26:46,230
What I'm going to pay, I'll be really,
it's going to be that. That crazy. Yup.

2688
02:26:46,660 --> 02:26:49,760
Why don't you just hold your pee
and we'll wrap this bitch up. No,

2689
02:26:49,810 --> 02:26:54,370
a la based comic. Angelo Bowers. No,
he had died today. What does he know?

2690
02:26:54,370 --> 02:26:56,910
Immediately hung out at the comedy
store a lot and stuff like that.

2691
02:26:56,920 --> 02:26:58,570
I don't know the exact details,

2692
02:26:58,571 --> 02:27:02,410
but I think he might've been in a car
with another friend of ours who we talked

2693
02:27:02,411 --> 02:27:05,440
about earlier in the podcast, Josh, Adam
Meyers and maybe a drunk driver hit him,

2694
02:27:05,530 --> 02:27:09,030
but I don't know if that's real. Do
you have a picture? Yeah, I don't know.

2695
02:27:09,220 --> 02:27:12,760
I that's,
that's songs.

2696
02:27:13,990 --> 02:27:17,650
Recipes to Fred James Too. I don't,
I don't know that dude, but fat.

2697
02:27:17,770 --> 02:27:21,250
Well maybe I might have met him
before. I'm not sure, but Fed James.

2698
02:27:21,251 --> 02:27:25,000
I knew very well. You Remember Fred
James Comedy store? I should do.

2699
02:27:25,400 --> 02:27:29,260
He was one of the first person
I met. No, he looks like a,

2700
02:27:29,290 --> 02:27:34,170
like Andrew dice clay, but squished
in fat jolly guy. Nice guy.

2701
02:27:34,390 --> 02:27:38,860
Yeah, he passed away
unfortunately. He was a great dude.

2702
02:27:39,010 --> 02:27:41,670
So rest in peace. Fet, James. Um, uh,

2703
02:27:41,770 --> 02:27:43,810
thank you to Brian Callin
for coming by brother.

2704
02:27:45,630 --> 02:27:48,460
Always like whenever I think you know,
you're just like Joey Diaz,

2705
02:27:48,461 --> 02:27:51,480
a Bert Kreischer when a or Duncan
Trussell whatever thing you're out of.

2706
02:27:51,490 --> 02:27:54,910
Interesting Shit to talk about. You come
with a wave of new things and I swear,

2707
02:27:54,911 --> 02:27:57,130
man,
when you were talking about the Holocaust,

2708
02:27:57,131 --> 02:27:59,260
I've always been aware of
the holocaust of course,

2709
02:27:59,470 --> 02:28:02,380
but there's something about the way
you were describing it that it was put,

2710
02:28:02,381 --> 02:28:06,460
it was shining like some extra light on
how fucking crazy and barbaric it was

2711
02:28:06,470 --> 02:28:09,370
really like you were, you were
saying, it's so eloquently,

2712
02:28:09,371 --> 02:28:13,800
it really made me like really tuned in
to how chaotic and Insane and disgusting

2713
02:28:13,801 --> 02:28:17,200
and horrific it really was.
It's really was and,

2714
02:28:17,290 --> 02:28:18,940
and important to keep in mind.

2715
02:28:18,941 --> 02:28:22,580
Also the lesson to the Holocaust is
that it can happen again in some form or

2716
02:28:22,581 --> 02:28:27,440
another human beings when you give
people power over you over you.

2717
02:28:27,500 --> 02:28:31,220
Yeah. Uh, you, you, they'll, they'll take
advantage and it sounds melodramatic,

2718
02:28:31,221 --> 02:28:33,640
but something like the Nda
actually does that. It's,

2719
02:28:33,650 --> 02:28:36,870
it's not what the constitution is the
first step. It's not how it was founded.

2720
02:28:37,160 --> 02:28:37,993
The country,

2721
02:28:38,060 --> 02:28:41,630
they knew that the people who founded this
country knew that shit could go wrong.

2722
02:28:41,631 --> 02:28:42,980
And so they had a bunch
of things in place.

2723
02:28:42,981 --> 02:28:46,100
And one of the things that Benjamin
Franklin said, and she never forget this,

2724
02:28:46,101 --> 02:28:50,340
that he who would sacrifice liberty
for security deserves neither. Oh,

2725
02:28:50,341 --> 02:28:52,970
that's a good way to end this
podcast. I love that. Say that again.

2726
02:28:53,000 --> 02:28:57,110
He who would sacrifice liberty
for security deserves neither.

2727
02:28:57,600 --> 02:29:00,650
They knew back then. Man. Someone's
going to play a shell game on you, man.

2728
02:29:00,860 --> 02:29:02,750
They're going to tell you this,
some bad people out there.

2729
02:29:02,990 --> 02:29:06,500
We need to look at your email to
protect you from them. That's right.

2730
02:29:06,590 --> 02:29:10,820
Those Fox get your own porn. Thank
you to liberty, liberty, liberty,

2731
02:29:10,821 --> 02:29:13,760
and justice for all. One of the most
important things that people forget,

2732
02:29:13,761 --> 02:29:16,780
and that's the issue of a liberty
God damn constitution. All right.

2733
02:29:16,781 --> 02:29:20,870
It's the bill of rights. It's in the, the
idea that this country was founded on,

2734
02:29:20,871 --> 02:29:23,240
they got away from a system
that's sucked and they said,

2735
02:29:23,241 --> 02:29:26,480
let's make one for the fucking
people, by the people, for the people,

2736
02:29:26,481 --> 02:29:27,141
by the people.

2737
02:29:27,141 --> 02:29:32,060
And now it's become for the corporations
and lobbying groups and lobbying groups

2738
02:29:32,061 --> 02:29:36,050
and cunts. It's for the cuts.
He just stopped the Kuntz.

2739
02:29:36,320 --> 02:29:37,310

02:29:57,171 --> 02:29:59,420
even Brian Cowen have fucked
these things and I'm telling you,

2747
02:29:59,421 --> 02:30:02,210
it's way better than beaten off and
you know you're going to beat off.

2748
02:30:02,300 --> 02:30:05,740
Stop playing games. Just go ahead
and auto one. And when you know,

2749
02:30:06,080 --> 02:30:08,960
when you're not in your little fake
vagina thing and you're like, oh,

2750
02:30:08,961 --> 02:30:13,230
you'd be like, Joe Rogan was
right. If you make this this, ah,

2751
02:30:13,730 --> 02:30:14,563
I usually go

2752
02:30:17,240 --> 02:30:20,990
fucking crazy silver back when I
thought, you know what, I sound like,

2753
02:30:21,290 --> 02:30:23,420
I sound like I stubbed my toe.
Oh my God,

2754
02:30:26,540 --> 02:30:30,980
I like to let six notes quickly.
Jimmy Burke, I heard him,

2755
02:30:31,010 --> 02:30:33,440
I heard him having sex
one time and he goes, oh,

2756
02:30:33,920 --> 02:30:38,570
oh God bless America. That's the
thing. When he blows Jimmy Burke,

2757
02:30:38,600 --> 02:30:43,430
I was like, Jesus, Jim,
thank you to [inaudible] dot
com makers of Alpha, brain,

2758
02:30:43,550 --> 02:30:46,910
shroom, tech, sport, shroom,
tech, immune and new mood,

2759
02:30:47,090 --> 02:30:49,730
all different types of supplements
for different things. Alpha brain,

2760
02:30:49,731 --> 02:30:53,900
is it cognitive enhancing supplement?
No. Mood is a serotonin boosting,

2761
02:30:54,200 --> 02:30:58,100
serotonin boost, boosting supplement,
and then of course a shroom tech.

2762
02:30:58,160 --> 02:31:00,890
Shroom tech sport is the one that's
for people who are like seriously in to

2763
02:31:00,891 --> 02:31:03,470
working out. If you're not,
skip that. And then shroom,

2764
02:31:03,471 --> 02:31:08,270
tick immune is a fascinating one where
it fires up your immune system because it

2765
02:31:08,271 --> 02:31:12,080
recognizes the mushroom that you're eating
as some sort of a a possible threat.

2766
02:31:12,380 --> 02:31:14,690
And then it gears up for a
fight that never takes place,

2767
02:31:14,691 --> 02:31:18,200
leaving you with a charge of
immune system. Pretty wicked
from what I understand.

2768
02:31:18,650 --> 02:31:20,130
But I don't understand any of this shit.
I'm just talking

2769
02:31:20,130 --> 02:31:22,770
out of my ass. I just work here.

them are a little hokey and some of the

2796
02:32:49,621 --> 02:32:54,270
little verbose, but whatever, bitch, you
don't have to buy anything. Just what?

2797

Why am I, why am I justifying anything?

out there and every one of my shows,

2809
02:33:36,961 --> 02:33:39,570
people say that all the weight staffs
are always saying how generous everybody

2810
02:33:39,571 --> 02:33:42,030
is and how nice everybody is
and how smart everybody is.

the world. To me that means everything.

2812
02:33:45,961 --> 02:33:47,490
That means we're putting
out the right vibe.
