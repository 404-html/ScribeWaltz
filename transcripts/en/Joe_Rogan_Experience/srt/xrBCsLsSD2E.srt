1
00:00:01,610 --> 00:00:05,060
What does that free kick is Dan?
Oh No,

2
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:08,580
I meant to wear at the panel yesterday.
Uh,

3
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:09,543
I actually,
I was late and I forgot what we're 

4
00:00:12,691 --> 00:00:15,480
talking about here folks is he has a 
free Keka Stan shirt.

5
00:00:15,481 --> 00:00:19,120
And I just learned about this very 
recently from Jordan Peterson.

6
00:00:19,121 --> 00:00:19,950
Yeah.
He loves it.

7
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:20,783
I had no idea.
I didn't know what the deal with the 

8
00:00:22,891 --> 00:00:23,724
frog was.
And do you know that you can't have the 

9
00:00:25,591 --> 00:00:27,990
frog now.
What does it on itunes?

10
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:30,570
Apple Itunes won't let you use the frog 
is great.

11
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,900
What the fuck people what?
What is apple doing?

12
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:36,090
It's a frog.
It's a cartoon frog.

13
00:00:36,091 --> 00:00:38,720
Hillary Clinton denounced it.
So she did now to Rog.

14
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:42,060
Oh yeah.
She said something about deplorables.

15
00:00:42,061 --> 00:00:43,920
What'd she say about the frog?
Oh,

16
00:00:43,921 --> 00:00:46,140
it was part of um,
uh,

17
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:48,400
an article on a website.
Oh,

18
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:51,900
they were saying how this causing frog 
is a hate symbol and so you're a fucking

19
00:00:51,901 --> 00:00:54,680
idiot.
He come home with him.

20
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,310
This is the best bit about the incident.
We can make them,

21
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:02,250
well,
they look ridiculous on their own.

22
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:05,370
Every means day.
It's just we're saying they were already

23
00:01:05,371 --> 00:01:08,100
like doing the bad thing,
lumping people into these groups.

24
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,420
But it is a weird thing that they don't 
understand.

25
00:01:12,421 --> 00:01:13,254
Like whoever gets upset at this does not
understand how preposterous it is to 

26
00:01:16,501 --> 00:01:21,501
freak out about a frog.
And who the fuck is over at apple?

27
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:22,733
First of all.
What about the poor bastard that made 

28
00:01:24,391 --> 00:01:29,391
pepe the frog for totally non Keka Stan 
Oh nine incident red pill reasons.

29
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:33,750
This poor bastard just had this cartoon 
frog did.

30
00:01:33,751 --> 00:01:36,040
He made feels bad man.
You know?

31
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:38,970
And then all of a sudden that poor guy 
has to say,

32
00:01:38,971 --> 00:01:41,830
I'm killing off.
Pepe did in the inner is like,

33
00:01:41,831 --> 00:01:43,500
bitch,
you not kill him off shit.

34
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,840
Nobody knows who you are,
but everyone knows who pepe is.

35
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:48,720
You can't kill off something like that.
That's so crazy.

36
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:52,010
It's silly to think that he could have 
achieved as well.

37
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:55,230
Everybody's so it's almost like they 
have to denounce it.

38
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,360
Yeah.
You know?

39
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:58,690
Otherwise they'll get lumped in with a 
supporter.

40
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:02,220
Like he probably does think that he's a,
people think he's a supporter maybe.

41
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,350
Well,
I don't think they do.

42
00:02:04,351 --> 00:02:05,430
I think he's like,
Oh,

43
00:02:05,431 --> 00:02:06,540
you know,
I don't know what's going on.

44
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:07,410
SONA.
Stan of it.

45
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:08,850
I haven't,
when he looked in stuff too much.

46
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:10,560
It's weird man.
Because like,

47
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:12,413
you know,
um,

48
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:14,213
people think there'd been shadow banned 
like a Scott Adams had a big post the 

49
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:19,980
other day.
We're city's been shadow banned phobias.

50
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,001
Yeah.
And He's put,

51
00:02:21,001 --> 00:02:24,990
he said he talked to Jack at twitter and
Jack said there's no shadow banning.

52
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,440
I talked to Joe Shuts Up Jack.
We know this show.

53
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:31,350
This is Sargon speaking just full of 
shit.

54
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:33,210
We know Jacksonville.
Holy Shit.

55
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:35,590
Why the fuck it was like a nice guy.
Jack.

56
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,361
Tell me,
Jack,

57
00:02:36,361 --> 00:02:37,900
why haven't I been verified?
Well,

58
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:43,070
he's probably super busy with the 400 
billion people that are on twitter.

59
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:44,243
Probably super full of Shit.
And so if you tried three times and 

60
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:50,130
every time that just denied why,
I mean,

61
00:02:50,131 --> 00:02:52,380
what is it then have enough?
How many followers do you have?

62
00:02:52,381 --> 00:02:53,214
200,000
that's supposed to Claudia accounts by 

63
00:02:55,021 --> 00:02:55,854
me.
My friends need to know who I am on 

64
00:02:56,701 --> 00:02:57,534
twitter.
Don't you think that's the reason that 

65
00:02:58,291 --> 00:03:00,030
for verification Jag,
isn't that

66
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:00,883
interesting?
Because if you were on a television 

67
00:03:02,291 --> 00:03:03,124
show,
it would be expected that you would be 

68
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:07,720
verified by now with that kind of 
following.

69
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:11,320
That's a giant following and your 30,000
on Youtube.

70
00:03:11,321 --> 00:03:12,700
So yeah,
that's a lot of people.

71
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:15,460
Seems worth firefighting before,
but it's not,

72
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:17,800
it's a badge of status,
which is one of the verified Milo.

73
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:20,300
I mean,
that's the most ridiculous one.

74
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:22,360
D verifying.
So you can't do that,

75
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:28,010
but verify someone and then not milo 
anymore as it jack like the guy.

76
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:29,170
Yeah,
you're a fucking lie.

77
00:03:29,171 --> 00:03:30,400
You know,
it's a badge of status.

78
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:31,443
You know,
you're doing it to create some sort of 

79
00:03:32,231 --> 00:03:33,370
privileged class on twitch.
I mean,

80
00:03:33,371 --> 00:03:35,860
they even get like a different function,
don't they?

81
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:37,173
Well,
you can only see some of the verified 

82
00:03:37,841 --> 00:03:38,674
hell.
Every account on twitter should be 

83
00:03:39,311 --> 00:03:41,680
verified thing you do.
Right?

84
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:44,560
You're allowed to only see a counselor 
verified.

85
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:45,790
Yeah,
it's a privilege.

86
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:49,450
And he took it away from mine to punish 
him for being a dissident.

87
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:52,570
And he won't verify me to punish me for 
being a dissident.

88
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:54,550
And he knows it.
This is a stranger.

89
00:03:54,551 --> 00:03:57,220
You're fucking balls deep in this dude.
You feel it?

90
00:03:57,221 --> 00:03:59,320
You're like very emotionally invested.
Oh yes.

91
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:00,071
Oh yeah.
That's,

92
00:04:00,071 --> 00:04:01,030
cause I've,
I've never,

93
00:04:01,031 --> 00:04:02,840
I've never had to play the game.
I'm,

94
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:05,620
I'm where I am now entirely on my own 
merits.

95
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,410
I've never,
I've never had any industry connections.

96
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,870
I've never been,
I've never been to America before.

97
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:12,520
I've never spoken to any of these 
people.

98
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:13,563
They all knew who I am and they're all 
afraid of me because I think because if 

99
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:19,210
I can do it,
anyone can do it.

100
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:21,120
But why,
why do you think it's fear?

101
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:23,230
Why do you think is,
well,

102
00:04:23,231 --> 00:04:25,480
we definitely don't need them.
No one needs anybody anymore.

103
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:26,883
But that's a good thing.
But you can't create a system of 

104
00:04:28,271 --> 00:04:31,150
privilege without interdependent 
connections.

105
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:32,503
There is no system of privilege if you 
don't have to rely on other people to 

106
00:04:34,511 --> 00:04:35,344
maintain a privilege class.
If you don't have to maintain the 

107
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:40,090
privilege class and you can't,
you don't have to rely on other people,

108
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:41,523
then their status goes away.
Let's break this down for people who 

109
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:45,040
don't know what the fuck we're talking 
about.

110
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:46,630
Okay.
Your,

111
00:04:46,631 --> 00:04:48,130
um,
may I call you Carl?

112
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:49,540
That's your actual name,
right?

113
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:51,080
I that cool.
He dead naming me.

114
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,570
He doxing.
Doxing.

115
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:54,940
But you've already been doxed we were 
discussing this.

116
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:57,700
Yeah.
Now I'm your youtube account.

117
00:04:57,701 --> 00:05:00,880
You have great videos.
Really great commentary.

118
00:05:00,881 --> 00:05:05,080
Very smart guy.
And how did you get involved?

119
00:05:05,081 --> 00:05:06,280
I mean,
are you like,

120
00:05:06,281 --> 00:05:08,110
what,
is this a you and outright guy?

121
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:09,430
No,
you're not right.

122
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:09,940
Yeah,
they,

123
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:12,640
they'll ride is an identitarian movement
for white people.

124
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:14,920
They're,
they're heavily nationalist,

125
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:16,720
protectionist,
anti interventionist.

126
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,750
They're not like laissez faire free 
market capitalist.

127
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:20,770
I'm a liberal.
I am,

128
00:05:20,771 --> 00:05:24,190
I'm like an English liberal as in I want
universal rights.

129
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:25,990
Laissez faire,
capitalism.

130
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:28,540
I don't mind.
I mean socialized health care and a well

131
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:29,443
a welfare state.
I'm happy with as long as it's 

132
00:05:30,581 --> 00:05:31,570
universal.
It was all done.

133
00:05:31,571 --> 00:05:34,210
Just applied some as long as anyone 
could access it if they needed to.

134
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,470
Um,
just universal rights rule.

135
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,470
I don't,
I don't see the,

136
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:43,000
I can't see a reason to discriminate 
against someone when it comes to dealing

137
00:05:43,001 --> 00:05:43,781
with rights.
Well,

138
00:05:43,781 --> 00:05:44,531
who's,
who's,

139
00:05:44,531 --> 00:05:45,364
um,
like defining outright is it been 

140
00:05:48,131 --> 00:05:48,964
clearly defined now because it's so new,
it's actually relatively well defined 

141
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:55,060
now because the old right have asserted 
themselves.

142
00:05:55,061 --> 00:05:55,391
I said,
look,

143
00:05:55,391 --> 00:05:57,010
no,
we're for white people.

144
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:59,030
You know,
Wipro while saying that,

145
00:05:59,031 --> 00:06:00,800
which,
which guys like,

146
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:03,870
he knows I'm like Ramsey pole as soon as
expensive,

147
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:06,530
but as soon as someone like that says 
they're all right,

148
00:06:06,531 --> 00:06:07,364
then everybody else just assumes that 
they like allows them to define it 

149
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:13,363
because I think there's probably a lot 
of people considered the cells all 

150
00:06:15,201 --> 00:06:15,980
right.

151
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:19,490
Where they were right wing,
but they weren't racist.

152
00:06:19,491 --> 00:06:20,890
They weren't,
or white supremacists,

153
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:23,870
they just didn't like this old man.
Right.

154
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:24,883
That was in there for four,
I think they call themselves the ultra 

155
00:06:27,101 --> 00:06:27,934
lights.
I don't know.

156
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:30,920
I don't know whether that's at a time of
disparagement or not.

157
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,193
Um,
but I over new rights or something like 

158
00:06:33,651 --> 00:06:34,484
that.
But the thing is I don't run in the 

159
00:06:35,011 --> 00:06:36,980
circles.
So actually I actually don't really know

160
00:06:36,981 --> 00:06:38,270
very much about those guys out of the 
pool.

161
00:06:38,271 --> 00:06:39,104
Jessie Watson's incentive itches.
I don't find that particularly 

162
00:06:41,111 --> 00:06:41,944
offensive.
I just find them to be like a modern 

163
00:06:43,251 --> 00:06:44,084
form of conservatism.
I think Paul Joseph Watson is a very 

164
00:06:47,151 --> 00:06:51,110
reasonable guy and he's very articulate.
He seems pretty smart.

165
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:52,190
He,
he,

166
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:54,890
he does the opposite of what the media 
does,

167
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,100
but the end,
it's it.

168
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:57,650
That's not,
that's not a criticism.

169
00:06:58,220 --> 00:06:59,150
Two points.
Yeah,

170
00:06:59,160 --> 00:06:59,580
exactly.

171
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,490
I thought a lot of things,
absolutely.

172
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:04,640
I think it's necessary for him to exist.
You know,

173
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:06,130
he's like,
you know,

174
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:08,200
cause they both create narratives and 
the,

175
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,800
it's not that these narratives aren't 
true,

176
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:13,430
it's just that sometimes these 
narratives sometimes leave things out.

177
00:07:13,431 --> 00:07:16,670
But always,
this isn't like a condemnation of either

178
00:07:16,671 --> 00:07:17,504
side by saying this,
this is just what they do and that's 

179
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:20,600
okay.
You know,

180
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,280
everyone's entitled to create their own 
sort of,

181
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:23,810
and I'm going to use the word 
propaganda,

182
00:07:23,811 --> 00:07:26,090
but again,
I'm not using it in a derogatory sense.

183
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,020
Right.
It's,

184
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:27,441
I mean,
you're like,

185
00:07:27,441 --> 00:07:28,550
look,
I want to make this point.

186
00:07:28,551 --> 00:07:29,720
I'm not,
I don't want to make your point,

187
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:31,640
you know,
because you're making your point.

188
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:34,250
I'm going to make my point and the these
two points,

189
00:07:34,251 --> 00:07:37,100
we'll both stand in existence and we'll 
both be true at the same time.

190
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,333
Hmm.

191
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:40,490
And so it's okay if Paul Joseph Watson 
to exist,

192
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,480
you know,
it's fine.

193
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:43,370
I don't have a problem with them.
I don't have,

194
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:45,950
I don't really have any criticisms of it
to be honest.

195
00:07:45,951 --> 00:07:46,784
Otherwise,
you know,

196
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:47,471
you know,
I,

197
00:07:47,471 --> 00:07:48,304
I mean I wouldn't do what he's doing,
but what is he doing that you wouldn't 

198
00:07:50,301 --> 00:07:53,210
do?
It gets a bit harder than I would and he

199
00:07:53,211 --> 00:07:54,044
didn't.
I don't think he is as objective as I 

200
00:07:55,521 --> 00:07:58,790
would prefer having a new source.
I prefer someone more like Philly d,

201
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,710
You know,
isn't that an interesting thing?

202
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:03,590
The objectivity is a,
this is a real,

203
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:07,100
real problem when it comes to left 
versus right or any of these groups.

204
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,520
You get lumped into these categories and
then you start defending your turf.

205
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,180
And uh,
that,

206
00:08:12,181 --> 00:08:15,290
that seems to be a huge issue today.
Yet,

207
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,393
everybody just started digging their 
heels in the sand and decides this is 

208
00:08:18,441 --> 00:08:19,190
who I am.

209
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:21,860
And those other p and you start using 
they and them,

210
00:08:21,861 --> 00:08:23,840
which is what I try to avoid that the 
bad guys.

211
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,190
Yeah,
they and they,

212
00:08:25,191 --> 00:08:26,870
what they want,
what the left wants.

213
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,080
And it's,
it's,

214
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,020
it's really tough actually because,
um,

215
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:32,480
that I've,
I'm actually done like channel.

216
00:08:32,481 --> 00:08:33,314
Uh,
I've actually pulled my subscribers and 

217
00:08:34,551 --> 00:08:36,710
stuff and I've got like,
it was a bit like a year ago,

218
00:08:36,711 --> 00:08:41,180
but I'm a content hasn't really changed.
Tena and I got like tens of thousands of

219
00:08:41,181 --> 00:08:42,890
responses,
so it was a really good sample size.

220
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:43,940
Uh,
most of,

221
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:47,900
most of my subscribers are center left 
liberals who just lost,

222
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:49,170
you know,
then identitarian is,

223
00:08:49,171 --> 00:08:50,510
they don't want to sit there and go,
you know,

224
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,673
I mean,
I was at vidcon and they had so many 

225
00:08:53,751 --> 00:08:56,970
panels and they're like,
let me about me being a Latin x.

226
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:58,920
Let me talk about me being in a Latina.

227
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:01,340
And it's like,
what a Latinex lots of next year.

228
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:06,060
Nonbinary loveliness.
I'll come over and I'm not,

229
00:09:06,061 --> 00:09:07,430
I'm not making this up.
And I'm joking.

230
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,273
I wouldn't,
I wouldn't make anything up and I won't 

231
00:09:08,941 --> 00:09:09,900
lie to you.
Right.

232
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:11,310
I'm absolutely serious.
This sort of,

233
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:13,290
but the thing is what really annoys me 
about identity politics,

234
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:14,124
right?
Um,

235
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:14,730
when they're like,
Yo,

236
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:16,170
let me tell you about my identity.
So I look,

237
00:09:16,171 --> 00:09:17,520
dude,
that's none of my fucking business.

238
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:19,350
I don't care about your fucking 
identity.

239
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:22,140
Do not tell me how you identify.
It's not my problem.

240
00:09:22,141 --> 00:09:23,940
It's not my business.
It's not political.

241
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:24,983
And if you want to make it political,
I'm going to tell you shut up and fuck 

242
00:09:26,251 --> 00:09:29,040
off cause I don't care.
Hey Joe,

243
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,110
let me say,
yeah,

244
00:09:31,111 --> 00:09:33,000
of course it is.
Let me tell you about my white identity.

245
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:35,030
We do this.
Yeah.

246
00:09:35,031 --> 00:09:39,630
See I told you Tino pay versus Latin x 
versus Latin II.

247
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:42,330
Which word best solves Spanish gender 
problem?

248
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,160
Really addressing the hard hitting 
issues here.

249
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,090
Jesus,
Rachel,

250
00:09:45,091 --> 00:09:46,920
Richard Reichard,
Rick,

251
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:49,850
when I say your name,
Gray card.

252
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:50,793
Right card,
right?

253
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:55,320
Yeah.
What are the best Spanish has gender.

254
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,270
What?
Gender problem.

255
00:09:57,810 --> 00:09:59,130
Exactly.
Exactly.

256
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:01,070
I've made up.
Well it is.

257
00:10:01,071 --> 00:10:02,880
It's talking about themselves.
They're not to point real problems.

258
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,430
Is this what happens when you have too 
many vaccines?

259
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:06,523
I,
I think it's what happens when you have 

260
00:10:07,981 --> 00:10:10,380
too much money.
We have people that are just too,

261
00:10:10,381 --> 00:10:12,310
it's too easy to get by.
This is a sim money,

262
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:14,730
food lenzer thinking,
hey,

263
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:17,370
people give a shit what I care what I 
think of my genitals.

264
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:18,653
No,
ready.

265
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:20,030
Get Out.
Yeah.

266
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,740
Unless you're sticking him in my face,
I really don't give a fuck.

267
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,730
Yeah,
exactly.

268
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:26,370
But then that's an interpersonal thing.
It's not like a political problem.

269
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,110
No,
it's not a political problem.

270
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:29,610
Well,
I mean what I mean,

271
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,890
the politics of human interaction,
I guess.

272
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:32,753
Yeah.
It's a little bit of that knows me most 

273
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:35,123
is when they say,
let me tell you about my blackness and 

274
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:37,163
like,
what the hell do you mean by your 

275
00:10:37,311 --> 00:10:38,250
blackness?
And they're like,

276
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,660
well,
meet me as a black person.

277
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:40,643
You're going to,
you're going to start stereotyping 

278
00:10:41,281 --> 00:10:43,140
yourself.
You're going to tell you,

279
00:10:43,141 --> 00:10:45,060
you're going to give me a stereotype of 
black people,

280
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:45,894
and then you're gonna say this is 
somehow representative nothing to you 

281
00:10:47,461 --> 00:10:48,294
but other people.
But then you're validating Richard 

282
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:50,581
Spencer when he says,
Hey,

283
00:10:50,581 --> 00:10:53,300
can I told her about my whiteness?
What's your argument saying?

284
00:10:53,301 --> 00:10:54,870
They're not allowed to do that.
Well,

285
00:10:54,871 --> 00:10:57,000
I know what's wonderful.
Why not?

286
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,133
You'll talk to me about your blackness.
I'll talk about my whiteness and all of 

287
00:11:00,301 --> 00:11:02,230
a sudden we're going to both realize,
you know,

288
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:04,410
we're just talking about ourselves,
which is talking about ourselves.

289
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:07,200
Why don't we talk about something real 
it did you see that woman,

290
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:10,000
the Delaware professor who,
um,

291
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:13,950
was talking about that kid that got 
killed in North Korea,

292
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:16,050
the kid who stole the propaganda poster 
know about the kid.

293
00:11:16,051 --> 00:11:17,490
I haven't seen the professor talking 
about,

294
00:11:17,491 --> 00:11:20,400
Oh man.
Each fall she just got fired today,

295
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,640
which is nice.
It's a good sign.

296
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:24,231
Yeah,
but what,

297
00:11:24,231 --> 00:11:25,064
what she had said is essentially he had 
it coming and that she's tired of rich 

298
00:11:28,621 --> 00:11:29,454
and blamers rich,
clueless white people who come to her 

299
00:11:33,391 --> 00:11:36,990
class and then she just goes on these,
this series of Straw Mans,

300
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:41,040
I'll have to do coke and have no problem
raping a girl at a Frat party.

301
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,310
Whoa.
Whoa.

302
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:44,093
Where'd that come from?
This guy just got beaten to death in 

303
00:11:45,691 --> 00:11:50,460
Korea and he shouldn't have raped girls.
He didn't rape anybody.

304
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:53,950
He did coke like this bitch.

305
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:55,890
No one should go fine.
Well,

306
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:58,000
she's apparently,
you know.

307
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,380
Yeah.
It's just racist.

308
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,330
She's racist towards white people.
I mean,

309
00:12:01,331 --> 00:12:04,570
you can be that and that's an oh yeah.
That's one of the wonderful things about

310
00:12:04,571 --> 00:12:05,404
the social justice warrior movement is 
that they've made it so it's impossible 

311
00:12:08,891 --> 00:12:10,720
to be raped,
racist towards white people.

312
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,370
They believe they believe it.
Yeah.

313
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:15,490
This is a real belief that if you are a 
white person,

314
00:12:15,491 --> 00:12:16,324
you're personal privilege and racism is 
something that a person of privilege 

315
00:12:19,391 --> 00:12:22,560
does to a person and a compromise group.
Yeah.

316
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:23,833
Do you know he's pretty funny about it.
Is they by saying it's a power plus 

317
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:28,180
prejudice.
They make it,

318
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,830
they say rice institutional and is that 
okay?

319
00:12:29,831 --> 00:12:33,790
But that means you're taking away the 
word for interpersonal racism.

320
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:36,580
So if like an Asian guy goes up to a 
black guy and says,

321
00:12:36,581 --> 00:12:38,620
hey,
enwood that copy racism,

322
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,513
because he doesn't have institutional 
power and there is no word for racism 

323
00:12:41,471 --> 00:12:42,304
between individuals.
Now you've redefined it to be 

324
00:12:43,811 --> 00:12:47,800
institutional.
So what is the word for interpersonal?

325
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:48,671
Yeah,
it's,

326
00:12:48,671 --> 00:12:51,100
I thought it will Chris rock bit about 
February.

327
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:54,070
Black Dude thinks he's tough as a native
American white and kick his ass.

328
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:57,093
I'm more marginalized group.
It says it is one of those things where 

329
00:13:01,151 --> 00:13:03,320
it's like people are seeking problems 
and there's,

330
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,233
they're also seeking to clearly identify
themselves as being from a more 

331
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:10,060
compromised group.
Politics.

332
00:13:10,061 --> 00:13:10,894
A victim.
Yeah,

333
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:12,930
exactly.
I'm the victim here at me.

334
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:14,080
Some special treatment.
It's like,

335
00:13:14,081 --> 00:13:15,070
dude,
I don't want to be a victim.

336
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:16,053
You feel about the Trans racialism I 
think there's no logical argument that 

337
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:22,600
Kingston can identify as an Eskimo as 
far as I can send you.

338
00:13:22,601 --> 00:13:23,434
Can they,
there was a big Hoohah or in academia 

339
00:13:25,001 --> 00:13:26,380
recently because someone published a 
paper,

340
00:13:26,381 --> 00:13:28,470
I'll come in the name of the person 
published papers saying,

341
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,830
well look,
what's the argument against this?

342
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:32,380
If you can identify as another agenda,
why can't you identify as another race?

343
00:13:32,381 --> 00:13:33,214
St Logic is applied to a different,
not necessarily because the argument of 

344
00:13:37,991 --> 00:13:38,824
you identify with another gender could 
be based on some sort of a hormonal 

345
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:47,400
issue or um,
some neurotransmitter misfire there.

346
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:50,980
There could be some something that could
be physically that could be,

347
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:54,700
if any of their arguments were hinges on
the idea that that mattered,

348
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:56,080
but it's not,
they say,

349
00:13:56,081 --> 00:13:56,914
well you can identify as anything you 
won't cause it's all the social 

350
00:13:57,911 --> 00:13:59,530
construct so you can do whatever you 
want with that.

351
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,000
Yeah.
That's where it gets slippery,

352
00:14:01,001 --> 00:14:01,300
right?
Yeah.

353
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:04,570
Where it gets really slippery is that 
sex and gender are social constructs.

354
00:14:04,571 --> 00:14:05,321
It's like,
well look,

355
00:14:05,321 --> 00:14:07,780
clearly that's not true in in it 
actually a district,

356
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:10,160
they all social constructs.
But the thing is they're not sexy.

357
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:13,390
It's not a social construct to say let's
go.

358
00:14:13,391 --> 00:14:14,224
Sex is based on your chromosomes and 
your agenda is a group of constructed 

359
00:14:18,371 --> 00:14:21,310
behaviors around them.
Constructed for a good reason.

360
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,850
Men have got,
you know,

361
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:23,740
clinical,
superior,

362
00:14:23,741 --> 00:14:24,574
natural advantage and things like 
strength and speed of women and women 

363
00:14:26,951 --> 00:14:29,170
need protection when they all say 
pregnant.

364
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:30,550
You know,
when they're looking after kids,

365
00:14:30,551 --> 00:14:31,384
they need society to look off to them 
because they have something that the 

366
00:14:34,221 --> 00:14:35,054
needs protecting.
And so we've got a whole and Inca 

367
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:37,853
society.
The reason you can tell that these are 

368
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,410
actually social constructs,
it's because every site is different.

369
00:14:41,411 --> 00:14:42,400
I mean,
in Saudi Arabia,

370
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:43,533
the men walk in front,
the women walk behind and they keep 

371
00:14:44,681 --> 00:14:46,690
their heads down and get and then they 
shut the fuck up.

372
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,630
That's a social construct.
And that's agenda role,

373
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:49,720
you know?
Right.

374
00:14:49,721 --> 00:14:53,030
But that's a cultural,
that's a gender role.

375
00:14:53,031 --> 00:14:53,840
And that's my point.
You know,

376
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:54,611
for us,
we don't do it.

377
00:14:54,611 --> 00:14:56,780
But it's not just necessarily,
I mean it's not like a,

378
00:14:56,781 --> 00:14:57,614
so like a social construct,
meaning that this is something that 

379
00:15:00,381 --> 00:15:02,840
occurs all the time.
Even in primates.

380
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:07,010
I mean there's a lot of behavior that 
males exhibit in nature.

381
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:09,590
Not saying there's no relation to 
biology,

382
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:12,140
but saying the they,
is it a social construct?

383
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:12,500
Well,
it's,

384
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,870
it's a behavior that we have.
It's,

385
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:16,790
it's not like something that's 
consistent,

386
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:17,653
like,
you know,

387
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:20,250
oh,
the old man [inaudible] the Dicks is not

388
00:15:20,251 --> 00:15:21,360
a social construct.
Right,

389
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:22,221
right.
Every,

390
00:15:22,221 --> 00:15:25,850
every man on earth does this,
but not every woman on earth has to walk

391
00:15:25,851 --> 00:15:26,684
behind her man,
suddenly 10 paces back because she's 

392
00:15:28,251 --> 00:15:31,340
female in the West.
It's actually know the other way,

393
00:15:31,341 --> 00:15:32,180
you know,
the amount of opens door,

394
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:33,014
the wind goes,
Whoa,

395
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:34,790
there's agenda role,
but it's not the same.

396
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:36,860
So it can be changed.
It is a social construct,

397
00:15:36,861 --> 00:15:39,320
but that doesn't mean that that isn't 
agenda role.

398
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:40,183
There is always a gender role.
It's always informed by biology because 

399
00:15:43,431 --> 00:15:45,830
men and women are fundamentally 
different and they always will be.

400
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:46,933
Well,
that's where people get slippery with 

401
00:15:47,601 --> 00:15:48,020
you,
right?

402
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:50,060
That's where they want.
Are they like in that way,

403
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:51,260
they like it in that way.

404
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:52,940
What is that?
Who's the one feminist?

405
00:15:52,941 --> 00:15:55,970
There's one really nutty young lady who 
was saying that,

406
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:56,863
um,
even physical strength is just because 

407
00:15:59,151 --> 00:16:01,270
men are encouraged to do physical 
things.

408
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,870
Are you referring to um,
uh,

409
00:16:02,871 --> 00:16:04,700
one and suck he's in?
Is that her?

410
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:05,990
Did she?
She's definitely said that.

411
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:06,960
Did she say that?
Yeah.

412
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:07,820
Oh,
come on.

413
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:09,920
I know she's loony,
but did she go that far?

414
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:14,340
There is a school of feminist thought 
that thinks this they the the,

415
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:15,920
Oh,
that's a fun one.

416
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:16,783
They really believe that the physical 
strength differences between men and 

417
00:16:20,091 --> 00:16:20,924
women are just because of the way 
society treats women and as men are 

418
00:16:23,601 --> 00:16:25,310
socialized to do sports.
I'm thinking,

419
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:26,630
come on,
that can't be real.

420
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:27,563
She just thinks that she said it.
I didn't know whether she believes and 

421
00:16:29,151 --> 00:16:29,984
see if he can find that.
She'd say she's from a video from like 

422
00:16:31,671 --> 00:16:32,630
2013 or something.

423
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:36,500
She seems quite the opportunist.
Wow.

424
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:40,320
She on the trust and verify galactic 
counsel,

425
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,920
what she seth and he was,
which was probably one of your wives and

426
00:16:42,921 --> 00:16:44,750
reasons Jack and then as she sent any 
wells,

427
00:16:44,751 --> 00:16:46,060
which is probably one of the reasons 
Jack,

428
00:16:46,061 --> 00:16:48,670
that I'm not verified you say she 
certainly was.

429
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:51,830
She was still a,
I don't know whether she's still,

430
00:16:51,831 --> 00:16:55,520
but I know that she's sending was a,
at least a contact for them.

431
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:56,923
But there's been a bit of an interesting
development with ms sockies in if you'd 

432
00:16:59,271 --> 00:17:00,300
like to hear about it.
Well,

433
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:02,060
tell people who she is.
Uh,

434
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:04,850
it doesn't even need no if I need to,
but most people don't know.

435
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:08,080
You'll live in a very insulated world.
Like straight ass.

436
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:09,530
My mom.
Oh yeah.

437
00:17:09,531 --> 00:17:11,440
You momondo but with them at the 
incident.

438
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:12,520
Yeah,
yeah,

439
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,100
yeah,
of course.

440
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,010
You're mumbling.
Uh,

441
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:14,871
okay.
And he's stuck.

442
00:17:14,871 --> 00:17:15,704
He's in is an internet feminist who 
decided the off the off the making a 

443
00:17:19,401 --> 00:17:20,234
bunch of videos on our youtube channel 
and late 2009 through to 2010 or 

444
00:17:23,871 --> 00:17:25,190
something,
uh,

445
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:26,200
12,
um,

446
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:27,463
she ended up getting a favorable 
reception with the progressive 

447
00:17:33,831 --> 00:17:34,700
intelligence.
Yeah.

448
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:37,640
We're very feminist,
very pro social justice.

449
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:40,520
And they liked her patter because it's,
um,

450
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,590
pretty stock,
pretty,

451
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:44,720
pretty stuck in trade and it's,
and she was,

452
00:17:44,721 --> 00:17:46,490
she came across as being very 
respectable.

453
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:47,660
You know,
she's well presented,

454
00:17:47,661 --> 00:17:49,070
she's attractive.
She's well spoken.

455
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:49,980
She,
she knows

456
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:52,320
her pastor.
And so they promote her.

457
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:54,060
They,
they made a big deal over,

458
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:59,750
she sounds like a total bigot when she's
talking about anything big it,

459
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:01,950
yeah.
Also because she'll just say,

460
00:18:01,951 --> 00:18:02,784
well this is men.
I mean the whole premise of feminism is 

461
00:18:04,891 --> 00:18:05,724
that men are oppressing women and if men
aren't oppressing women than feminism 

462
00:18:08,731 --> 00:18:13,731
has no argument and they also have a 
sort of thing they say to each other,

463
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:20,040
you have the rights to hate,
your oppressor is right to do this.

464
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:20,911
And it's like,
okay,

465
00:18:20,911 --> 00:18:23,350
but I don't think it's have a right to 
hate even if you want.

466
00:18:23,351 --> 00:18:25,200
But this is something that she said 
personally,

467
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:27,510
personally over there.
She probably has said it personally,

468
00:18:27,511 --> 00:18:30,330
but this is the,
the sort of ideological thought.

469
00:18:30,331 --> 00:18:32,790
I mean if you read their papers,
if you read that,

470
00:18:32,791 --> 00:18:34,710
if you read the new one that they them 
thing again.

471
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,420
Right.
Okay.

472
00:18:36,421 --> 00:18:37,830
They're talking about hardcore 
feminists.

473
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:38,713
We are talking about like a specific 
sphere of academic feminists in her 

474
00:18:41,401 --> 00:18:42,420
case,
sex negative.

475
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,270
Xix neg.
What?

476
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:44,841
Yeah,
they don't,

477
00:18:44,841 --> 00:18:45,674
they don't,
they don't like objectification or they 

478
00:18:47,281 --> 00:18:49,650
don't like sexy women in titties.
Sex negative.

479
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,730
Yeah.
They don't like sexy women.

480
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:54,720
And the male gaze is oppressing women 
Croft Tomb Raider.

481
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:55,411
Gotcha.
Yeah.

482
00:18:55,411 --> 00:18:56,850
That was the,
that was part of the big issue,

483
00:18:56,851 --> 00:18:57,684
right.
It was like sexist because of Lara 

484
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:01,590
Croft.
Terrible,

485
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:03,690
terrible oppression.
I don't know how women can get over it,

486
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:04,950
but a,
and he suck.

487
00:19:04,951 --> 00:19:06,470
He's in stepped up and was like,
you know,

488
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:09,010
it's wrong to look at these tits.
And everyone was like,

489
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:12,210
she's wearing a really tight top for a 
reason and she's not real.

490
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:14,450
Yeah.
Uh,

491
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:15,503
but yeah,
so basically any psyches and comes from 

492
00:19:16,591 --> 00:19:17,970
a school of sex,
negative feminism.

493
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:22,350
And she decided that she would take 
advantage of all this.

494
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:23,183
Now in 2010 there was a video,
I think it was 2010 that the video was 

495
00:19:25,591 --> 00:19:26,424
recorded in black and white of herney 
university giving a speech where she 

496
00:19:28,981 --> 00:19:30,120
says,
I'm not a Gamer.

497
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:31,133
I had to learn a lot about gaming to get
into all this and then come 2012 I mean 

498
00:19:34,591 --> 00:19:38,610
that that video wasn't released until 
after she did her tropes versus women in

499
00:19:38,611 --> 00:19:41,730
gaming.
Kickstarter 2012 May,

500
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:42,563
2012 she starts as kickstarter.
And when I was in within the first few 

501
00:19:45,091 --> 00:19:45,924
days,
she starts posting updates on that I'm 

502
00:19:47,341 --> 00:19:49,080
being harassed and said,
well yeah,

503
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:52,770
people generally react negatively to 
phenomenal bigots on the Internet.

504
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:54,870
They don't like it.
People don't like him.

505
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:58,410
I mean like when you say men are 
oppressing women and everything she says

506
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,273
is a variant of men are oppressing women
in it is the male gaze is highly 

507
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:03,264
oppressive to women.
Toxic masculinity is highly or preston 

508
00:20:05,281 --> 00:20:05,520
women's.

509
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,480
Okay.
When,

510
00:20:06,481 --> 00:20:08,400
when come in legitimately look at women 
in eater,

511
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:10,230
no answer.
What is,

512
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:12,990
what is non toxic masculinity?
There's no such thing.

513
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:14,003
So what you're saying is masculinity and
men checking out chicks is just bad and 

514
00:20:17,311 --> 00:20:18,144
you hate it and the men are all bad for 
doing this and there are pressing the 

515
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:20,843
women when they do miss well.
That's why I said it seems like she's a 

516
00:20:23,281 --> 00:20:27,270
bit of a fight.
She's got an angle and she realizes that

517
00:20:27,271 --> 00:20:30,870
there's a lot of attention that goes 
towards that angle and she runs with it.

518
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:32,490
I mean if I turned around and said,
well women,

519
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:36,510
a bunch of miniature manipulative slags 
who will take your money and run,

520
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:37,820
they be like,
you're a fucking massage,

521
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:38,663
but I got to stop you there.
Cause I don't think she's ever said all 

522
00:20:40,201 --> 00:20:42,270
men.
I don't think she said that she doesn't,

523
00:20:42,271 --> 00:20:45,810
she just uses the term men.
I don't think she does.

524
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,130
I mean I really don't think says she

525
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:48,963
had,
that guy is her fucking head guy writes 

526
00:20:50,921 --> 00:20:51,754
for what Mecca is sad.
I know I'm just doing now nothing 

527
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:58,360
basically the,
this,

528
00:20:58,361 --> 00:21:00,040
this terrible thing.
But I want to,

529
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:01,260
I want to set the record straight if you
thinks,

530
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:02,890
because this,
this is something that really annoys me.

531
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:03,850
So,
um,

532
00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:06,490
I went to vidcon recently and vidcon.
Yeah.

533
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:09,850
What does that youtube convention in 
Anaheim sounds a good time.

534
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:13,210
It was a really good time for me,
but it wasn't,

535
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:16,180
it wasn't for them that their panels 
look like a bloody death march when they

536
00:21:16,181 --> 00:21:17,960
spot a sing in the car.
Their life faces like,

537
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:19,060
oh God.
I was like,

538
00:21:19,061 --> 00:21:20,410
why did they get upset at you?
Yeah.

539
00:21:20,411 --> 00:21:22,090
Just cause we sat there,
listened to what they had to say.

540
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:25,200
In fact,
if you heard about this dude,

541
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:26,470
I'm insulated.
Oh dude,

542
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,630
this is crazy.
So it's like easy.

543
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:32,350
And uh,
she spots me sitting in the audience and

544
00:21:32,351 --> 00:21:34,990
then she starts freaking out.
Freaking out.

545
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:35,920
Yeah.
She starts,

546
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:36,813
she starts saying things like,
there's a constant harasser of mine 

547
00:21:39,281 --> 00:21:40,030
called me,
you know,

548
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:41,080
she called me a shithead.
It,

549
00:21:41,081 --> 00:21:43,570
she called me a garbage human,
a garbage human.

550
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,000
I did nothing to her.
I didn't say a word.

551
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:49,840
I just sat in the audience while she's 
there cussing me out on the stage.

552
00:21:49,841 --> 00:21:50,674
And I mean this,
now she's on the stage with a 

553
00:21:51,791 --> 00:21:52,624
microphone.
She's just calling you a shithead and 

554
00:21:53,951 --> 00:21:54,784
the garbage human.
And this was because you have made 

555
00:21:57,131 --> 00:21:58,450
videos about her.
Is that what it is?

556
00:21:58,451 --> 00:22:01,510
Because I've made videos debunking her 
points and she,

557
00:22:01,511 --> 00:22:05,140
she's under the impression that all of 
my videos are about her.

558
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:08,380
And I actually on the ride over,
I got people to like count up for me.

559
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,221
Uh,
I've,

560
00:22:09,221 --> 00:22:12,580
I've made around 30 videos and about 
four years referring to,

561
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:13,890
and that's a lot.

562
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:14,541
No,
no,

563
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:15,700
no.
It sounds nice.

564
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:16,563
Did it sounds like a lot,
but that's less than 4% of the videos 

565
00:22:19,181 --> 00:22:20,890
I've made.
I've made 780 videos.

566
00:22:20,891 --> 00:22:22,750
I work hard.
I'm sure you do.

567
00:22:22,751 --> 00:22:23,584
But that's still 30 videos.
I don't care if you've made 100 million 

568
00:22:25,721 --> 00:22:27,670
videos,
you still make 30 videos about her.

569
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:30,650
That's a large number.
Maybe it's a large number compared to an

570
00:22:30,651 --> 00:22:32,300
Ito who hardly does any bloody work.
But,

571
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,600
but that's,
that's another interesting point.

572
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:35,463
But what's,
what's interesting about it is if 

573
00:22:37,961 --> 00:22:40,090
someone puts something out there,
you know,

574
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,073
you going to get,
expect that someone is going to come 

575
00:22:43,931 --> 00:22:44,764
along,
especially a guy like you that is very 

576
00:22:47,051 --> 00:22:47,884
opinionated.
And if someone has very different 

577
00:22:49,841 --> 00:22:52,540
opinions in yours,
you're going to have a contrary point.

578
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:53,403
Of course,
there's definitely not harassing but 

579
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:57,093
can't be.
We're in a scary position if that's 

580
00:22:58,420 --> 00:22:59,290
exactly what fine.

581
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:01,180
So how are we,
how will you harassing?

582
00:23:01,181 --> 00:23:02,030
Like what,
what was the,

583
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:03,223
and that's the thing,
the worst thing you've ever said about 

584
00:23:04,721 --> 00:23:06,490
her,
that she's wrong.

585
00:23:07,370 --> 00:23:07,841
Yeah.
Well.

586
00:23:07,841 --> 00:23:08,490
Yeah,
I mean,

587
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:09,323
she,
you will never find someone who says 

588
00:23:11,081 --> 00:23:12,460
she's a,
she's a good critic.

589
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:14,710
She's a terrible critic,
and she always has been.

590
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:15,813
She's always been,
it's always been rightly pointed out to 

591
00:23:17,321 --> 00:23:20,830
her that she's cherry picked every time.
No one stands by her work.

592
00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:21,843
She's become like a symbol of feminism 
because will the harassment she's 

593
00:23:24,221 --> 00:23:26,280
received now that is a part of the 
problem.

594
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:26,940
Right.
Okay.

595
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:29,080
Tim Culture,
it's very strange.

596
00:23:29,081 --> 00:23:33,340
It's like you don't get any props unless
someone's sending you horrible messages.

597
00:23:33,341 --> 00:23:35,590
And then,
because a lot of people have been caught

598
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:38,320
doing it to themselves,
which is really fucked up,

599
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,193
Eh,
loads like the black lives matter 

600
00:23:40,211 --> 00:23:41,500
activists and whatnot.
But yeah,

601
00:23:41,501 --> 00:23:43,870
so basically she's,
her work sucks.

602
00:23:44,010 --> 00:23:44,950
It's,
it's just bad.

603
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:45,980
I mean,
nobody in the

604
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:47,210
video game industry will turn around 
say,

605
00:23:47,211 --> 00:23:49,100
you know what?
That's great criticism.

606
00:23:49,101 --> 00:23:51,590
Need to only,
only like the progressive press.

607
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:53,420
What black lives matter.
Oh,

608
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:55,183
he's just got a protest.
They basically run around and to the 

609
00:23:56,991 --> 00:24:00,560
university's compute system logged into 
a fake twitter account or something,

610
00:24:00,561 --> 00:24:03,770
send themselves a bomb threat and the 
police tracked it down and they're like,

611
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:07,400
we have the video camera footage if you 
yeah,

612
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:08,030
yeah,
it was,

613
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:09,290
it was actually really funny.
Um,

614
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:10,153
but yeah,
it's so funny with their need to be a 

615
00:24:11,571 --> 00:24:14,240
victim.
Well it validates them.

616
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:17,240
It renewed just when you don't have an 
argument and you need to be a victim.

617
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,313
Well does she expect that or know that 
she's going to be able to put these 

618
00:24:21,231 --> 00:24:23,870
points out and not have anybody dispute 
these points?

619
00:24:23,890 --> 00:24:24,920
Well,
I'm guessing so.

620
00:24:24,921 --> 00:24:25,754
And she always,
she always conflates all criticism with 

621
00:24:27,441 --> 00:24:27,830
harassment.

622
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:28,663
She's never addressed the critic.
And the first time she was dressed as a 

623
00:24:30,531 --> 00:24:33,140
critic,
it's me and she's calling me names.

624
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:34,070
Yeah.
That's how I go.

625
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:35,690
That's not sounding good level.
Yes.

626
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:36,553
Not,
not very good.

627
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:37,890
Good luck.
She said,

628
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:38,773
she says,
I'm responsible for all of the 

629
00:24:39,921 --> 00:24:41,780
harassment now.
All of it.

630
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:44,360
Well at least definitely not hers.
That's not her fault.

631
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:47,150
And then it's a controversial opinion 
and someone disputes it.

632
00:24:47,151 --> 00:24:49,810
That person disputes it.
Is responsible for all the restaurant.

633
00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:50,810
Yeah.
Well basically I've,

634
00:24:50,811 --> 00:24:53,240
I've always,
I've always said right from the get go,

635
00:24:53,810 --> 00:24:54,643
don't have a contact them.
Don't ever contact them because for a 

636
00:24:56,361 --> 00:24:57,340
start,
I mean,

637
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,273
they don't want to listen.
She's not interested in hearing your 

638
00:24:59,571 --> 00:25:02,420
fucking opinion so that we're both,
she's got nothing but contempt for you.

639
00:25:02,421 --> 00:25:04,820
But secondly,
don't send a harassment because a,

640
00:25:04,821 --> 00:25:08,690
it's immoral and b,
she's got the victim card that gives her

641
00:25:08,691 --> 00:25:10,070
money when she,
when you go,

642
00:25:10,071 --> 00:25:11,420
when you send her a message saying,
Hey,

643
00:25:11,421 --> 00:25:12,650
neither,
I think you're a bitch.

644
00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:14,480
She goes,
Chich Ching,

645
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:15,453
you know,
and then she runs off to the next 

646
00:25:16,370 --> 00:25:17,203
interview.
We'll that she gets paid some of her 

647
00:25:18,561 --> 00:25:21,050
speeches at university.
She's been paid 20 grand a speech.

648
00:25:21,051 --> 00:25:22,520
That's hilarious.
I'm not joking.

649
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:23,720
Right.
And it's just,

650
00:25:23,721 --> 00:25:25,970
and for her to go,
the Internet is being mean to me.

651
00:25:25,971 --> 00:25:26,804
Well,
maybe if you want to be in a bigger 

652
00:25:27,291 --> 00:25:28,370
online,
they wouldn't be.

653
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,353
Maybe if you actually did some solid 
work and didn't say video games are 

654
00:25:31,021 --> 00:25:33,680
making everyone's sexist,
which that obviously not,

655
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:35,590
this wouldn't be happening to you.
But the,

656
00:25:35,591 --> 00:25:36,424
the thing that pisses me off most about 
the accusations towards me of 

657
00:25:39,171 --> 00:25:40,004
harassment,
apart from the fact that I've never 

658
00:25:41,061 --> 00:25:42,380
harassed her,
and if there was any evidence,

659
00:25:42,381 --> 00:25:45,140
I'd harassed that it'd be all over the 
Internet right now.

660
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:45,741
You know,
I mean you,

661
00:25:45,741 --> 00:25:46,574
it would be nothing but twix bars 
because they trying to paint me as a 

662
00:25:49,551 --> 00:25:51,350
harasser when I'm actually just a critic
oppose.

663
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:53,240
And I've always been completely against 
it.

664
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:56,240
But what really annoys me is that her 
kickstarter,

665
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:57,830
if you look at it now,
if you get go to it,

666
00:25:57,950 --> 00:26:01,040
you can pull it up now and you can see 
tropes versus women and like,

667
00:26:01,041 --> 00:26:02,060
you know,
she's got to spill and then,

668
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:03,410
oh,
the terrible messages,

669
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:04,400
the harassment,
the harassment.

670
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:05,653
That was in May,
2012 I didn't make a video on Youtube 

671
00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:08,923
until July,
2013 this has been happening to her her 

672
00:26:12,051 --> 00:26:14,390
whole career.
It's nothing to do with me.

673
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:17,610
It's to do with her.
It's because she's a dick.

674
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:22,240
Everyone can see it.
Like God Guy Pussy.

675
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:23,990
Yeah,
I'm culinary Dick.

676
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,390
You're a dick.
And he said,

677
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,490
Dick,
he looked into the cam.

678
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,720
Do you know?
Do you want to know something?

679
00:26:29,721 --> 00:26:33,110
I've spoken to a lot of interesting 
people recently since I've been here,

680
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:38,500
lots of people who know you personally,
an eater and they say everyone hates you

681
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:40,670
because you're a dick.
Oh,

682
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:44,130
this has getting mean Dj.
You shouldn't see she put up about

683
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:45,480
me today.
Another one.

684
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:46,790
Oh yeah,
it's calling me harassing,

685
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:47,633
calling me all this stuff.
It's like,

686
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:48,331
no,
you're a dick.

687
00:26:48,331 --> 00:26:49,164
Anita.
It did you find a video of her saying 

688
00:26:51,181 --> 00:26:55,140
that there's no biological difference 
between the sexes and that strength will

689
00:26:55,141 --> 00:26:56,950
be buried in the middle of this,
that he really,

690
00:26:57,630 --> 00:26:59,770
I really think that it was her,
now that I'm thinking about,

691
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:00,861
I've,
I've,

692
00:27:00,861 --> 00:27:02,790
I've looked at it as like maybe she took
it down with something,

693
00:27:02,791 --> 00:27:04,150
so I remember seeing it.
I wish I'd saved,

694
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:04,993
someone's got to save it somewhere.
Someone on the Internet will be able to 

695
00:27:07,471 --> 00:27:12,270
tweet to ass or something because it's 
so hilarious because it's so contrary to

696
00:27:12,271 --> 00:27:14,550
biology,
just actual science.

697
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:16,620
Everything she says is contrary to 
reality.

698
00:27:16,621 --> 00:27:17,454
I mean,
she'll sit there and she'll pick out 

699
00:27:17,881 --> 00:27:18,714
like,
like the game hit man in her video she 

700
00:27:19,861 --> 00:27:20,840
said something like,
uh,

701
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:25,020
you're incentivized to,
to kill the woman then then stuff a body

702
00:27:25,021 --> 00:27:27,640
in the trunk and the footage she's 
using,

703
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:28,543
she didn't take herself obviously and 
didn't credit whoever took it in the 

704
00:27:31,231 --> 00:27:32,010
footage she's using.

705
00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:35,580
You see the guy go up and kill the go 
and you see them lose points.

706
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:37,650
I just don't know.
That's a disincentive realization.

707
00:27:37,651 --> 00:27:39,390
You know,
that they're not incentivizing you.

708
00:27:39,391 --> 00:27:42,260
They're saying penalizing you for this 
Anita Uj.

709
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:43,343
I mean,
I thought my very first video was two 

710
00:27:45,211 --> 00:27:46,350
and Easter as well.
You know,

711
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:51,440
you very first in like July,
2013 and I ice the,

712
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:54,900
the soulless started off because of her.
We were inspired,

713
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:55,531
well,
kind of,

714
00:27:55,531 --> 00:27:57,900
but there was a lot of things that kind 
of,

715
00:27:57,901 --> 00:27:59,300
you know,
that were going on.

716
00:27:59,320 --> 00:27:59,981
I was like,
you know,

717
00:27:59,981 --> 00:28:02,580
I,
I feel the need to say something just a,

718
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:04,710
but apart from the quality being 
terrible,

719
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:08,700
I'm bewildered at her.
I listened to it the other day and I was

720
00:28:08,701 --> 00:28:09,241
just like,
wow,

721
00:28:09,241 --> 00:28:11,970
I had no idea what was going on.
And I was just like,

722
00:28:11,971 --> 00:28:12,480
look.
And he said,

723
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,010
I think you're just wrong on this.

724
00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:16,060
I think you,
I don't think you understand like the,

725
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:19,260
there is a lot to this that you,
you've left,

726
00:28:19,290 --> 00:28:21,630
you've left out.
I should've said Cherry picked,

727
00:28:21,631 --> 00:28:22,860
but you know,
and that's,

728
00:28:22,861 --> 00:28:23,694
that's something that's dogs are hell 
creek because that's all she's ever 

729
00:28:24,781 --> 00:28:25,614
done.
Her Christmas was terrible and everyone 

730
00:28:26,701 --> 00:28:29,160
knows it.
Nobody likes it because she's a divisive

731
00:28:29,161 --> 00:28:31,890
bitch and all she does is play the 
victim.

732
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:34,440
She's got nothing she has nothing else 
does.

733
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:36,730
As long as it's not talking about hurts 
specifically because we're,

734
00:28:36,731 --> 00:28:37,564
we're kind of beating her down here.
But it's hard to think of anything 

735
00:28:40,411 --> 00:28:42,840
genuinely good about her talking about 
her.

736
00:28:42,841 --> 00:28:43,674
I mean what I'm saying is about this,
these ideas instead of concentrating on 

737
00:28:45,781 --> 00:28:46,614
her as a person that had been debunked a
million times all over the internet by 

738
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,020
everyone and their mother at this point.
I do.

739
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:53,850
I,
well,

740
00:28:53,850 --> 00:28:56,670
why I want to get to what's interesting 
to me is like what is causes?

741
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:57,893
What causes these people to group up to 
these weird sort of echo chambers 

742
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,760
reiterating things that don't really 
work or make sense.

743
00:29:05,761 --> 00:29:08,520
Like there's no biological difference 
between men and women,

744
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:09,653
especially when it comes to strength and
then the tropes about video games and 

745
00:29:13,561 --> 00:29:15,240
also like,
here's the other thing,

746
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:17,790
like when that Gamergate thing happened,
yeah,

747
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:18,653
it was,
it was really fascinating to me that 

748
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:20,843
everybody wanted to absolutely.
To lump people in one or two categories 

749
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:27,540
and the two categories of people that 
are appalled to it,

750
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:29,820
appalled by it,
and that think that,

751
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:30,683
you know,
sexism is a boren and all this stuff is 

752
00:29:32,131 --> 00:29:34,890
terrible.
And then the other people who supposedly

753
00:29:34,891 --> 00:29:35,724
if you,
if you wanted some sexy images in video 

754
00:29:39,091 --> 00:29:40,470
games,
you had to be a piece of shit.

755
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:42,940
Oh yeah.
Like you sex negative feminists.

756
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:43,873
Yeah.
Well that it got into this weird 

757
00:29:46,121 --> 00:29:47,380
category where people like,
Hey,

758
00:29:47,381 --> 00:29:50,170
we don't want you meddling with,
with art.

759
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:52,840
And whether it's a Frank Frazetta 
censoring it.

760
00:29:53,050 --> 00:29:53,830
Yeah.
I mean,

761
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:54,663
look,
if you look at some of Frazetta stuff 

762
00:29:55,781 --> 00:29:58,780
with the girls in the bikinis and 
familiar,

763
00:29:58,781 --> 00:29:59,614
but I mean how famous fantasy artists,
oh well we sold like talking about like 

764
00:30:02,981 --> 00:30:06,120
the [inaudible] earlier,
beautifully painted.

765
00:30:06,121 --> 00:30:06,954
It's like these oil barbarians.
It's a celebration of the human fizzy 

766
00:30:10,241 --> 00:30:12,100
cause there's first perfect zenith.
Yes.

767
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:12,791
Yeah,
yes.

768
00:30:12,791 --> 00:30:17,791
It's all Robert Howard's book on Conan.
And frazetta was like the most famous of

769
00:30:18,911 --> 00:30:19,570
the,
yeah it was.

770
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:22,660
But it's very cartoonish depictions of 
women,

771
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:26,110
you know,
like with giant tits and Brian blood all

772
00:30:26,111 --> 00:30:27,220
over the place.
And it's,

773
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:30,370
it's silly.
It doesn't make you hate women.

774
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:31,543
That's what's gross.
Like just like looking at Fabio and the 

775
00:30:33,671 --> 00:30:36,340
cover of a romance novel doesn't mean 
you hate men.

776
00:30:36,690 --> 00:30:37,490
Yeah,
right,

777
00:30:37,490 --> 00:30:38,350
right.
In fact,

778
00:30:38,351 --> 00:30:39,940
it seems you're kind of lionizing and 
look,

779
00:30:39,941 --> 00:30:40,774
this is,
this is the perfect depiction of what 

780
00:30:42,221 --> 00:30:43,360
the artist wanted.

781
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:44,213
See like a man look like in a huge 
rippling hero carrying the median or 

782
00:30:47,351 --> 00:30:48,184
whatever.
But it becomes this weird thing when 

783
00:30:49,181 --> 00:30:51,640
it's a man.
People don't have a problem with it.

784
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:52,713
No one says that.
It demonizes the male figure and that 

785
00:30:55,630 --> 00:30:56,463
you know that you have set these 
unnatural standards so you fucked with 

786
00:30:59,261 --> 00:31:03,400
the self esteem of all these young men,
but you absolutely have and the same way

787
00:31:03,401 --> 00:31:06,250
you do it with women like body shaming 
or you know,

788
00:31:06,251 --> 00:31:10,750
having ridiculous standards for bodies 
for females that works with men too.

789
00:31:10,751 --> 00:31:12,110
It's the same claims.
Yeah,

790
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,033
of course does.
But they don't care because feminists 

791
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,033
dichotomize the world is women being 
oppressed and the oppressors and it's 

792
00:31:18,071 --> 00:31:19,150
okay,
take your oppressor.

793
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:22,750
That's the,
that's the root of old feminist tool.

794
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:23,613
But that's why I want to talk about this
in terms of the ideas because I think 

795
00:31:25,961 --> 00:31:28,930
it's kind of the same thing as the right
versus the left.

796
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:32,170
And I think it's all like a symptom of 
human psychology.

797
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:35,080
The right versus the left is tribalism,
tribalism.

798
00:31:35,081 --> 00:31:37,410
But so it's female versus male.
It's,

799
00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:38,263
it's these,
when you look at this blind allegiance 

800
00:31:40,481 --> 00:31:41,314
towards anyone with a vagina,
it's very similar to someone who was 

801
00:31:43,571 --> 00:31:45,670
blind allegiance to is anyone who is in 
a red state.

802
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:47,230
I mean that's true,
but the,

803
00:31:47,231 --> 00:31:48,064
the people in the red site,
do they say that the blue states were 

804
00:31:49,271 --> 00:31:50,170
oppressing them?
Oh yeah,

805
00:31:50,171 --> 00:31:51,760
absolutely.
I'll do that for sure.

806
00:31:53,050 --> 00:31:54,380
Oh yeah.
Well maybe it is.

807
00:31:54,381 --> 00:31:55,990
Hey Obama,
he's a communist.

808
00:31:55,991 --> 00:31:58,360
He came from Kenya.
He wants to ruin America.

809
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:00,100
He wants to kill it from the inside.
I mean,

810
00:32:00,101 --> 00:32:00,934
that was the big narrative forever.
It's not them saying he's holding them 

811
00:32:03,851 --> 00:32:04,990
down.
Well,

812
00:32:04,991 --> 00:32:08,620
there was always like a thing that he 
was holding him down with the economy or

813
00:32:08,621 --> 00:32:09,454
that he was holding them down with 
obamacare and he was ruining so many 

814
00:32:12,461 --> 00:32:13,360
different factors.

815
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:15,400
It takes in America,
he hates America.

816
00:32:15,610 --> 00:32:18,890
It doesn't sound exactly the same to me 
because the,

817
00:32:18,930 --> 00:32:19,763
the,
the feminists are essentially what was 

818
00:32:21,371 --> 00:32:25,390
called Neo Marxist and they take the 
sort of Marxist dichotomy of the economy

819
00:32:25,391 --> 00:32:28,450
with the bourgeoisie personally 
proletariat through the American systems

820
00:32:28,451 --> 00:32:29,284
and their wealth and apply it to men 
being the bourgeoisie and women being 

821
00:32:31,721 --> 00:32:32,740
the proletariat.
Right.

822
00:32:32,741 --> 00:32:36,180
Which is highly ironic given the 
evidently privileged status in society.

823
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,510
Women hold,
well,

824
00:32:37,511 --> 00:32:41,750
that's when it got weird when everybody 
repeating that fucking wage gap thing.

825
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,480
That was one of the most frustrating 
talking points.

826
00:32:44,481 --> 00:32:45,314
Even Obama,
the Goddamn president of the United 

827
00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:49,910
States on tv reiterating something that 
he knows is not true.

828
00:32:50,130 --> 00:32:52,010
Yeah,
that was very frustrating.

829
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:53,120
Yeah,
because I just,

830
00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:54,163
I feel like human beings are inclined 
very naturally to form a group to stay 

831
00:32:59,001 --> 00:32:59,834
tribal and then I think it works with,
I think that is a part of what's 

832
00:33:02,931 --> 00:33:05,490
happening,
whether it's Neil Marxism that's collect

833
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:06,523
connected to it or what,
there's something that's happening with 

834
00:33:08,601 --> 00:33:10,970
feminism versus masculine people.

835
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:12,800
Yeah.
I'm an enemy,

836
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:13,783
but there's no like masculinist so he's 
have to say masculine [inaudible] silly 

837
00:33:19,221 --> 00:33:19,650
though.
Yeah,

838
00:33:19,650 --> 00:33:20,670
that'd be funny.
Yeah.

839
00:33:20,690 --> 00:33:21,523
This apparently a feminism is,
what would you have mechanism that 

840
00:33:24,111 --> 00:33:25,040
sounds dumb,
doesn't it?

841
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:25,880
And they're like,
yeah,

842
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,800
well then that's how feminism sounds to 
us.

843
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:28,663
Well,
it's the most amazing thing that it's 

844
00:33:30,441 --> 00:33:33,320
taken so long for male feminists to die 
off.

845
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:34,513
Like that's finally like rotting away 
after a few of them have been outed as 

846
00:33:38,181 --> 00:33:40,640
being creepy.
I was going to say that it's a honey.

847
00:33:40,641 --> 00:33:42,320
I mean,
thank the baby Jesus.

848
00:33:42,321 --> 00:33:44,390
They got caught because look,
man,

849
00:33:44,391 --> 00:33:45,224
there's nothing wrong with being male.
And just because you're a human with a 

850
00:33:47,421 --> 00:33:48,254
Dick doesn't mean you're a bad person if
they think there's something wrong with 

851
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:51,053
being male,
well,

852
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,033
we only do because they want to fuck 
those girls and they don't have any 

853
00:33:55,041 --> 00:33:55,910
other way to fuck us.

854
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:57,260
Well,
I mean that's probably the roots of it,

855
00:33:57,261 --> 00:34:00,020
but that's 100% of the,
ultimately you see male feminists,

856
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:01,700
yes,
they're going to win any fights.

857
00:34:01,770 --> 00:34:02,930
No,
I know what I'm saying.

858
00:34:02,931 --> 00:34:06,140
They gonna do they even need to shave?
Some of them do.

859
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,033
They're going to be,
they're going to be receding hairlines 

860
00:34:08,451 --> 00:34:11,240
and Fedoras and they'll like molesting 
all over the place,

861
00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:12,680
Jordan,
because instead of the best,

862
00:34:12,681 --> 00:34:14,670
he said they're sneaky.
They had definitely not.

863
00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:16,620
But they're afraid.
They're afraid of like men like you,

864
00:34:16,621 --> 00:34:18,050
you know they're never going to compete 
with you.

865
00:34:18,051 --> 00:34:18,560
Yeah,
yeah.

866
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:21,260
But they don't have to compete with 
themselves.

867
00:34:21,261 --> 00:34:22,930
That's what they don't see that right 
away.

868
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:23,773
They got fucked by genetic,
some of them love and got fucked by 

869
00:34:26,391 --> 00:34:29,120
genetics and so they're taking the only 
evolutionary strategy they've got.

870
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:30,133
You can hardly blame him but they need 
to do is get to the lab and figure out 

871
00:34:32,331 --> 00:34:33,164
crisper.

872
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:37,550
We're work on re reengineering yourself 
to look like for the fucking gym.

873
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:39,170
That's what they to do.
Seriously.

874
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,880
If you're a male feminist,
just shut up.

875
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:42,800
Stop talking about feminism on the 
Internet.

876
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:43,873
Look at yourself going to die.
It got on the gym and in a couple of 

877
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:47,840
years time you'll be a bit bigger.
You'll be a bit,

878
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:50,460
if she's five foot one and you weigh 80 
pounds on us,

879
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:52,880
you're fucked.
Keep eating sprouts.

880
00:34:53,650 --> 00:34:54,740
I've got,
I've got a friend,

881
00:34:54,741 --> 00:34:57,020
he's a quite short guy.
Do you know what he did?

882
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:57,913
He did.
Muslim is a nippy little guy and he's 

883
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:01,340
quite strong in nippy.
Yeah,

884
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:02,210
no,
you can get around.

885
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:03,043
He can get around.
He's an amazing that we got to like a 

886
00:35:04,911 --> 00:35:07,730
boulder climbing.
He's amazing at it.

887
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,820
You would not believe how unbelievable 
his,

888
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:10,753
his,
his girlfriend is so attractive I 

889
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:16,070
believe here and he's so self confident.
I should host a seminar mean this is how

890
00:35:16,071 --> 00:35:16,890
I did it.
Yeah,

891
00:35:16,890 --> 00:35:20,090
he should.
It's just self improvement.

892
00:35:20,091 --> 00:35:22,360
You will kill yourself and then things 
work out for you.

893
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:23,571
That,
I mean,

894
00:35:23,571 --> 00:35:25,040
absolutely think that that's a good 
thing.

895
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:25,993
Absolutely.
But I understand the motivation wipe 

896
00:35:27,891 --> 00:35:31,640
someone becomes a male feminist.
[inaudible] the word allies,

897
00:35:31,641 --> 00:35:34,210
one of my favorite ally,
ally,

898
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:37,700
I just love that they are now synonymous
with creepy harasser.

899
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:38,230
Well,

900
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:39,063
you kind of knew it all from the 
beginning that that was what it was 

901
00:35:40,861 --> 00:35:42,480
going on.
Everybody knew it.

902
00:35:42,530 --> 00:35:45,450
Like especially heterosexual men.
You're like,

903
00:35:45,451 --> 00:35:48,090
I know what you're doing.
You fucking weasel.

904
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:50,310
You know you're putting women above all 
else.

905
00:35:50,311 --> 00:35:52,620
One guy read his twitter profile and he 
was talking about,

906
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:53,350
he goes,
oh,

907
00:35:53,350 --> 00:35:54,450
oh,
in his twitter post.

908
00:35:54,451 --> 00:35:55,284
Rather he said,
I'm going to stop calling myself a 

909
00:35:57,871 --> 00:36:01,620
feminist until feminists decide that I'm
doing feminism right.

910
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:02,573
I'll make women respect you.
But the fact that he put it out on 

911
00:36:04,321 --> 00:36:06,330
twitter like you,
you put that at like,

912
00:36:06,331 --> 00:36:10,200
this is just like this giant white flag.
It's,

913
00:36:10,330 --> 00:36:11,700
Oh yeah.
That's the thing.

914
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:13,590
You know,
people in general,

915
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:14,453
women being people respect boundaries.
There's the people who will enforce her 

916
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,510
own boundaries.
This guy's literally said,

917
00:36:18,511 --> 00:36:19,321
hey,
I have no boundaries.

918
00:36:19,321 --> 00:36:20,610
You tell me what to do,
I'll be a slave.

919
00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:22,440
No one's going to respect that.
You know,

920
00:36:22,441 --> 00:36:24,260
I'll be a willing servant and keep 
showing.

921
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:26,090
And there was just finding nice Douche 
bag,

922
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:28,223
you have to say,
I'm going to stop saying I'm a feminist 

923
00:36:30,241 --> 00:36:32,700
until feminists telling me I'm doing 
feminism.

924
00:36:32,701 --> 00:36:33,534
Right.
There's a reason that they call them 

925
00:36:34,201 --> 00:36:35,034
cooks.
What does,

926
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:36,870
it's a good word.
It is.

927
00:36:37,410 --> 00:36:39,480
That's a good word to know what it 
meant.

928
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:43,890
I thought it always meant like a cock 
hold like a porn film.

929
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:45,150
I mean,
you kinda did originally,

930
00:36:45,151 --> 00:36:47,520
but now it's just kind of being someone 
who wants to end up themselves.

931
00:36:47,610 --> 00:36:49,470
Yeah.
And that's really good use for it.

932
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:50,480
Well,
it's also subtle.

933
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:52,500
It's not just someone who won't stand up
for themselves.

934
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:54,740
Someone who is pandering.
Well yeah,

935
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:57,090
like you're pandering to the laughter 
pant.

936
00:36:57,091 --> 00:36:57,924
You're trying to paint yourself out as 
being very sort of hoping that the 

937
00:37:01,141 --> 00:37:02,640
person you're selling yourself out.

938
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:03,940
So we'll treat you linearly.
See,

939
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:06,150
so instead of talking about individuals,
what I'm,

940
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:11,180
what I'm really fascinated about is the 
psychology behind what's going on now in

941
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,980
this culture of free expression.
Yeah.

942
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:17,160
The fact that a guy like you can not see
anything wrong with you,

943
00:37:17,161 --> 00:37:17,994
but I mean the guy was just a gentleman 
from England who doesn't have a 

944
00:37:21,481 --> 00:37:26,481
connection to the media owner can just 
by virtue of your ability to communicate

945
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:30,000
and put out some youtube videos and have
some really good points,

946
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:33,000
you can have this massive,
massive following.

947
00:37:33,001 --> 00:37:37,830
This is an n the these ideas that people
are spreading back and forth.

948
00:37:37,831 --> 00:37:40,920
Even the weird ones like the Kec Stan,
the frog and all that shit.

949
00:37:40,921 --> 00:37:43,680
It's just a Jag,
but it's interesting to me.

950
00:37:43,681 --> 00:37:45,900
It's interesting to see what happened.
Like,

951
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,033
like what,
what I feel like is like Fox News and 

952
00:37:49,681 --> 00:37:50,514
CNN and even major networks when 
especially all the ones that are trying 

953
00:37:54,361 --> 00:37:55,620
to portray narratives.

954
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:59,050
All the ones that are talking about the 
way life is and you know,

955
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,233
they seem to me to be like these,
these huddled up executives at the top 

956
00:38:06,570 --> 00:38:10,740
of like a giant pile of crocodiles 
snapping at them.

957
00:38:10,770 --> 00:38:15,720
It's like they've completely lost 
control over what people talk about.

958
00:38:15,721 --> 00:38:20,721
They were on the spire of rock and it's 
the oceans slowly eroding.

959
00:38:20,930 --> 00:38:24,060
It's snapping.
It was nothing there.

960
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:26,510
There was no water,
there was no crocodiles.

961
00:38:26,850 --> 00:38:31,170
The only information that got away,
I mean that was the only information got

962
00:38:31,171 --> 00:38:32,460
out,
was through mass media.

963
00:38:32,461 --> 00:38:36,040
Mass media was controlled by 
corporations and we like for the

964
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:38,440
longest time,
that was the only way.

965
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:41,770
And they still operate like that's the 
only way.

966
00:38:41,771 --> 00:38:42,604
It's really quite fascinating narrative.
Hedger mooney social media has 

967
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,190
demolished them and we're not going 
back.

968
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:49,930
No,
this is not going back.

969
00:38:50,050 --> 00:38:51,440
It's not going back.
And the,

970
00:38:51,490 --> 00:38:54,620
I think the only companies that truly 
understand that or uh,

971
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:57,190
Internet based companies that are trying
to manage it,

972
00:38:57,191 --> 00:39:00,520
like whether it's youtube or google or 
even Netflix,

973
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:01,900
yeah,
they understand it,

974
00:39:02,010 --> 00:39:02,843
but you know,
they're trying to manage it in some 

975
00:39:04,061 --> 00:39:06,760
weird ways that like,
I'm really bummed out about Netflix.

976
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:07,594
Thumbs up versus thumbs down.
Like what do you know what you should 

977
00:39:10,451 --> 00:39:12,910
have?
You should have 100% thing.

978
00:39:12,911 --> 00:39:17,050
So give them one to a hundred the more,
more range you give someone,

979
00:39:17,051 --> 00:39:18,730
the better.
But up and down,

980
00:39:18,731 --> 00:39:21,730
it's just fucking silly.
If I were going to review things,

981
00:39:21,731 --> 00:39:22,210
oh,
do it.

982
00:39:22,210 --> 00:39:23,043
Recommended not recommended and it would
be quite subjective to my personal 

983
00:39:25,241 --> 00:39:25,770
taste.
It,

984
00:39:25,770 --> 00:39:26,603
it'll be able to see,
look,

985
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:27,753
if you've been following me for awhile,
you know what I like and I'd give my 

986
00:39:29,801 --> 00:39:30,634
reasons.
And I tried to explain it as accurately 

987
00:39:31,661 --> 00:39:33,310
and concisely and as objective as I 
could.

988
00:39:33,690 --> 00:39:34,410
So the,
the,

989
00:39:34,410 --> 00:39:37,300
the,
the largest sweep of people watching the

990
00:39:37,301 --> 00:39:39,880
video could understand why I felt the 
way I did.

991
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:42,280
And so the end of [inaudible] would,
would I recommend it?

992
00:39:42,281 --> 00:39:43,061
Yeah.
And you know,

993
00:39:43,061 --> 00:39:43,894
your mileage may vary or yeah,
you've got to watch this or something 

994
00:39:45,731 --> 00:39:46,564
like that,
you know,

995
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:48,640
but I,
I hate the star system.

996
00:39:48,641 --> 00:39:49,330
It's like,
wow.

997
00:39:49,330 --> 00:39:50,000
I mean,
you know,

998
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:50,740
it's,
it's,

999
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:52,510
it makes it sound objective when it's 
not really,

1000
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:54,760
you know,
sometimes it's objective,

1001
00:39:54,790 --> 00:39:56,080
you know what I mean?
It can be,

1002
00:39:56,110 --> 00:39:57,370
I mean,
he's not perfect though.

1003
00:39:57,371 --> 00:39:58,204
I agree with you.

1004
00:39:58,210 --> 00:39:59,230
It,
again,

1005
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:01,990
with a lot of this little stuff,
it's about aesthetics and tastes.

1006
00:40:02,410 --> 00:40:03,850
So for sure,
I mean,

1007
00:40:03,970 --> 00:40:06,460
I loved the movie hardcore Henry.
I mean,

1008
00:40:06,461 --> 00:40:07,270
I,
I like,

1009
00:40:07,270 --> 00:40:08,103
and I realized that I irrationally love 
this note was the single person who had 

1010
00:40:11,241 --> 00:40:12,160
the first,
first person.

1011
00:40:12,170 --> 00:40:14,310
Yeah,
there was a lot about it.

1012
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:15,640
I've said that.
Oh,

1013
00:40:15,641 --> 00:40:18,110
you'll love it.
And I'm sure like it looks like guy like

1014
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:19,310
crazy,
but it's,

1015
00:40:19,311 --> 00:40:20,830
it's not for everyone.
It's for,

1016
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:21,693
it's for the sort of guy.
He's got a lizard brain who likes 

1017
00:40:22,961 --> 00:40:24,310
violence,
lizard brain.

1018
00:40:24,730 --> 00:40:28,450
That's what you think about me.
You were an MMA fighter.

1019
00:40:28,950 --> 00:40:29,783
I'm a fighter.
I kickbox I did taekwondo and there was 

1020
00:40:33,401 --> 00:40:35,950
no mma when I was okay.
But did you enjoy finding other people?

1021
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,113
Um,
that's a very complicated question 

1022
00:40:39,130 --> 00:40:39,930
obviously.
I know.

1023
00:40:39,930 --> 00:40:43,270
And did you enjoy for many years?
So I know,

1024
00:40:43,271 --> 00:40:47,050
I mean it's complicated in that I did,
it was important for me,

1025
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:49,060
but I don't necessarily know if I 
enjoyed it.

1026
00:40:49,090 --> 00:40:51,400
I definitely enjoyed winning.
But uh,

1027
00:40:51,430 --> 00:40:52,630
it is,
uh,

1028
00:40:52,870 --> 00:40:55,060
it was such a like how call him,
it was a task,

1029
00:40:55,110 --> 00:40:56,230
you know,
you'll like it when you get,

1030
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:58,500
when you get past the sort of,
uh,

1031
00:40:58,570 --> 00:41:00,820
maybe the beginning of it is more 
shaking the rest of it.

1032
00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:01,983
But,
um,

1033
00:41:01,990 --> 00:41:04,600
when you get past the initial sort of,
this is weird to look at,

1034
00:41:05,050 --> 00:41:05,600
you'll,
it,

1035
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,720
it's fast paced,
it's action packed,

1036
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:11,050
and it definitely taps into that sort of
lizard brain,

1037
00:41:11,051 --> 00:41:11,884
whether it's the male desire to fight 
this guy at the end of the film that 

1038
00:41:15,611 --> 00:41:17,800
he's,
he's literally in like a fist brawl with

1039
00:41:17,801 --> 00:41:21,690
like 30 other dudes and it's,
it's the most insane and he's just,

1040
00:41:21,691 --> 00:41:22,524
you know,
it's all coming at him and he's just 

1041
00:41:22,961 --> 00:41:23,351
Bam,
Bam,

1042
00:41:23,351 --> 00:41:24,960
Bam.
It's how get,

1043
00:41:24,961 --> 00:41:26,790
get stoned and watch it and get drunk or
watches.

1044
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:29,920
It's just the best thing if you're into 
that sort of thing.

1045
00:41:29,950 --> 00:41:32,110
But if you're not into that,
you weren't like it at all.

1046
00:41:32,650 --> 00:41:34,120
You wouldn't anytime an inch that

1047
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:35,330
like,
I like John Wick,

1048
00:41:35,710 --> 00:41:36,590
he's not always,
you know,

1049
00:41:36,591 --> 00:41:37,424
but like,
you know,

1050
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:39,170
John Wick two,
how about that?

1051
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:40,460
I've never,
it wasn't even that good.

1052
00:41:40,910 --> 00:41:41,361
But,
uh,

1053
00:41:41,361 --> 00:41:41,781
the,
you know,

1054
00:41:41,781 --> 00:41:42,614
it's,
it's for a certain kind of person in a 

1055
00:41:43,401 --> 00:41:45,050
certain kind of mood,
but when it hits,

1056
00:41:45,051 --> 00:41:47,690
right,
I mean it was the first film in a long,

1057
00:41:47,691 --> 00:41:49,060
long time that I was just sat in the 
cinema,

1058
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:51,620
just enjoy it with a smile on my face.
I was just enjoying this.

1059
00:41:51,621 --> 00:41:53,270
This was great fun,
you know.

1060
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:54,480
But I,
I presented it,

1061
00:41:54,481 --> 00:41:55,314
it was just like tapping into the 
primordial desire to defeat your 

1062
00:41:58,401 --> 00:42:00,030
enemies.
I just thought it was interesting.

1063
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:02,390
They shot at like a video game,
like quake,

1064
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:07,540
first person shooter and stuffing.
So this vidcon thing that you went to,

1065
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:12,290
who puts this together?
Hank and John Green.

1066
00:42:12,590 --> 00:42:14,930
And who are they?
The vlog brothers.

1067
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:16,400
They're famous youtubers.

1068
00:42:16,910 --> 00:42:17,743
And uh,
I find it very interesting when Anita 

1069
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:21,860
was calling me a shithead and garbage 
human,

1070
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:24,860
that's a direct violation of that code 
of conduct.

1071
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:27,150
And did they do anything about it?
No.

1072
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:30,800
I know because she's a feminist because 
she's a woman.

1073
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:33,970
Oh.
Because she gets special cause she's in,

1074
00:42:33,971 --> 00:42:34,804
he suck.
He's in because she gets special 

1075
00:42:35,601 --> 00:42:38,870
treatment because at this point she's 
basically become the avatar feminism.

1076
00:42:39,230 --> 00:42:41,960
If she fails,
I swear to God in that.

1077
00:42:41,970 --> 00:42:44,040
But I mean she respected in that world.
No,

1078
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:44,420
no,
no.

1079
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:46,430
Everyone hates her.
Why did they still prop her up?

1080
00:42:46,431 --> 00:42:47,840
Because she's an,
he's in.

1081
00:42:48,170 --> 00:42:49,740
If she doesn't make any sense,
why don't,

1082
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:50,583
I mean,
well,

1083
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:55,640
there's a myth os that's built up around
her and get word.

1084
00:42:55,910 --> 00:42:57,740
Yes.
It's um,

1085
00:42:58,490 --> 00:43:01,820
and they've all propped her up.
They've all propped her up level,

1086
00:43:02,090 --> 00:43:04,730
said good things about her.
They've all defended her.

1087
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:08,030
And if it turns out that she is in fact 
an abuser,

1088
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:11,390
which she did according to the Vidcon 
code of conduct,

1089
00:43:11,570 --> 00:43:13,250
which,
what is the code of conduct?

1090
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:13,751
Oh,
I,

1091
00:43:13,751 --> 00:43:16,340
I can't remember it verbatim,
but I read down a video.

1092
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:17,900
Uh,
it's one of my latest videos.

1093
00:43:17,901 --> 00:43:18,734
Um,
it was just a quick message to hank and 

1094
00:43:19,581 --> 00:43:20,414
John Green and a,
I know that thousands of people email 

1095
00:43:22,491 --> 00:43:23,151
them saying,
hey look,

1096
00:43:23,151 --> 00:43:23,984
she did violate your code of conduct 
from a position of institutional 

1097
00:43:26,661 --> 00:43:28,490
privilege at Vidcon.
She was on the panel.

1098
00:43:28,491 --> 00:43:30,020
I didn't have a microphone.
She had a microphone,

1099
00:43:30,290 --> 00:43:32,660
she's calling me names,
she's accusing me of things on true.

1100
00:43:33,070 --> 00:43:34,820
She,
and she was doing that while you were in

1101
00:43:34,821 --> 00:43:38,000
the audience directly looking me in the 
eye and it was like,

1102
00:43:38,001 --> 00:43:39,320
okay,
that's fine,

1103
00:43:39,770 --> 00:43:41,960
but uh,
that's not right.

1104
00:43:42,530 --> 00:43:45,410
And they've done nothing.
They have done nothing.

1105
00:43:45,410 --> 00:43:46,900
They've said nothing.
You talk.

1106
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:51,250
And then afterwards,
all I got from her fans and,

1107
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:52,220
and I mean like,
you know,

1108
00:43:52,221 --> 00:43:53,054
hundreds and hundreds of messages and I 
just retweeted them all night with 

1109
00:43:55,821 --> 00:43:59,500
exactly the same language she uses when 
she's displaying.

1110
00:43:59,501 --> 00:44:00,334
I'll look of the nasty messages I'm 
guessing of people calling me eight 

1111
00:44:02,381 --> 00:44:04,340
garbage human,
which is what she called me.

1112
00:44:04,820 --> 00:44:07,610
And so she has done absolutely nothing 
different.

1113
00:44:07,670 --> 00:44:08,330
And so I said,
right,

1114
00:44:08,330 --> 00:44:11,060
hank and John,
she's violated your code of conduct.

1115
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:12,013
Her fans,
she's incited a submodel of harasses 

1116
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:17,720
exactly as she claims I do.
But she has actually done this.

1117
00:44:18,230 --> 00:44:23,230
Then on the Saturday,
she was due to be on a panel about cyber

1118
00:44:23,510 --> 00:44:24,343
harassment c but it can't be harassment 
when she's a woman and you're a man 

1119
00:44:30,051 --> 00:44:34,940
because you are the oppressor.
So it's the same thing as racism and the

1120
00:44:34,950 --> 00:44:37,270
black person being raised against a 
white person.

1121
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:38,153
It possible.
The only reason to do this then to not 

1122
00:44:40,441 --> 00:44:45,441
to take no action is if you are highly 
ideological and interesting.

1123
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:49,320
So you feel like they're high Dhea.
Highly ideological.

1124
00:44:49,321 --> 00:44:50,460
Yeah.
Incredibly biased.

1125
00:44:50,580 --> 00:44:52,860
But why are they,
if they're youtube stars,

1126
00:44:52,861 --> 00:44:54,950
I mean aren't they like don't they 
understand?

1127
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:56,640
They're very progressive,
very progressive.

1128
00:44:56,641 --> 00:44:58,620
But you're fairly progressive too.
I'm a liberal.

1129
00:44:58,680 --> 00:44:59,513
I'm not progressing.
What is the difference between a 

1130
00:45:00,070 --> 00:45:02,340
liberal,
a liberal and progressive ones?

1131
00:45:02,341 --> 00:45:05,050
Quality of outcome,
quality of outcomes,

1132
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:06,113
complete night and day.
It really drives what the problem with 

1133
00:45:08,010 --> 00:45:09,790
liberals and progressives.
Wow.

1134
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:10,673
This is by definition is that I've 
always thought progressive means that 

1135
00:45:13,591 --> 00:45:17,550
you support gay rights,
you support a women's right comes forth.

1136
00:45:17,620 --> 00:45:19,560
That's the outcome of gays.
With non gays,

1137
00:45:20,230 --> 00:45:22,530
they won't case that non games we case 
to have the same.

1138
00:45:22,531 --> 00:45:22,980
I said,
no,

1139
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:24,030
I'm done the wrong.
I want that too.

1140
00:45:24,030 --> 00:45:24,863
And this is what I was gonna say.
There's a lot of open overlapping 

1141
00:45:26,251 --> 00:45:27,720
magisterial when it comes to these 
things.

1142
00:45:27,721 --> 00:45:28,554
For example,
they're great word magisterium and I'm 

1143
00:45:30,350 --> 00:45:31,830
getting,
never heard that before.

1144
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:33,930
[inaudible] use that.
Areas of interest,

1145
00:45:33,990 --> 00:45:34,823
things that they won't have domains.
The worry of sounds so much better than 

1146
00:45:36,781 --> 00:45:39,150
areas of interest though.
So write that down.

1147
00:45:39,151 --> 00:45:40,110
Jamie.
What's going to start?

1148
00:45:40,330 --> 00:45:42,900
I'm sorry to use that one.
Magistarium oh,

1149
00:45:42,901 --> 00:45:44,210
so glad I'm giving you something.
Yeah.

1150
00:45:44,730 --> 00:45:45,481
So yeah,
basically,

1151
00:45:45,481 --> 00:45:46,220
you know,
liberal,

1152
00:45:46,220 --> 00:45:50,100
there's no real argument against uh,
gay rights from a liberal perspective.

1153
00:45:50,101 --> 00:45:51,720
Cause liberals want universal rights.
Of course,

1154
00:45:51,750 --> 00:45:53,520
if some people can get married,
gay should be up to get married.

1155
00:45:53,550 --> 00:45:54,600
So it's the argument,
Oh,

1156
00:45:54,610 --> 00:45:56,270
I'm Christine get fucked.
I'm an atheist,

1157
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:57,360
not argument.
Right?

1158
00:45:57,600 --> 00:46:00,660
Where's the progressive they wanted 
because someone else has it.

1159
00:46:00,690 --> 00:46:01,523
Someone else has this,
therefore they want this because they 

1160
00:46:02,581 --> 00:46:03,000
want.

1161
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,780
And then whose definition by there's a 
yours a year defining them.

1162
00:46:07,210 --> 00:46:08,540
That's what they define as,
you know,

1163
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:09,433
they are the ones saying all this.
I mean like affirmative action is the 

1164
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:14,610
uh,
or example of this.

1165
00:46:15,930 --> 00:46:16,763
A liberal would never ask for FM to 
action because in the liberal worldview 

1166
00:46:19,081 --> 00:46:21,300
people should be free to pursue their 
own goals.

1167
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:22,403
Now,
I mean the liberals and usually very 

1168
00:46:24,121 --> 00:46:25,650
anti racist.
That's not a,

1169
00:46:25,710 --> 00:46:28,440
that's not a cancer in which you would 
judge someone him sex.

1170
00:46:28,470 --> 00:46:29,880
You know,
I would never turn around and say,

1171
00:46:29,881 --> 00:46:31,740
right,
okay well you'll see these were the kid.

1172
00:46:31,741 --> 00:46:32,491
I mean,
you know,

1173
00:46:32,491 --> 00:46:35,040
you clean know what you're doing,
but you've got some tents so get out.

1174
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:36,630
You know,
that would be ridiculous.

1175
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:37,720
You know what,
that's not a,

1176
00:46:37,780 --> 00:46:39,690
not a reason to do that.
Um,

1177
00:46:39,990 --> 00:46:42,000
but the progressive we'll do that.
If you're a man,

1178
00:46:42,330 --> 00:46:43,500
the progressive will say,
well I'm sorry,

1179
00:46:43,501 --> 00:46:44,460
we've got,
you know,

1180
00:46:44,461 --> 00:46:45,294
we want equality and this is,
this is what we define a quality of 

1181
00:46:47,790 --> 00:46:48,360
different years.

1182
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:50,640
I call it equality of opportunity.
They call it quality of outcome.

1183
00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:51,690
Cause they'll turn around and say,
well,

1184
00:46:51,691 --> 00:46:54,150
you know what,
we've already got like a 70% men.

1185
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:55,073
So I mean you'll see you might be great 
but you've got a deck so we can't take 

1186
00:46:57,451 --> 00:46:58,284
you.
We're going to take that unqualified 

1187
00:46:58,921 --> 00:46:59,754
woman instead because we need to get to 
parity because they want a quality of 

1188
00:47:02,431 --> 00:47:03,480
outcome.
There were 50% men,

1189
00:47:03,481 --> 00:47:06,260
50% women.
I have a friend who was a,

1190
00:47:06,261 --> 00:47:07,094
a big wig at a big internet company and 
they had to deal with that shit all the 

1191
00:47:10,381 --> 00:47:11,214
time,
where going to have men who were far 

1192
00:47:12,811 --> 00:47:13,644
more qualified,
who they were getting pressured of push 

1193
00:47:16,621 --> 00:47:17,454
out to make room for my,
like they were specifically looking for 

1194
00:47:20,941 --> 00:47:21,774
qualified black woman.
They were like going out of their way 

1195
00:47:24,361 --> 00:47:26,820
because they wanted to give out the 
appearance of diversity.

1196
00:47:26,850 --> 00:47:27,683
Exactly.
But that's because they're also scared 

1197
00:47:29,050 --> 00:47:30,160
of criticism.
Right.

1198
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:30,993
So they're scared of being attacked for 
the of activists and by race pimps and 

1199
00:47:34,811 --> 00:47:36,730
there's there,
there are a lot of race pimps,

1200
00:47:36,850 --> 00:47:38,050
which is like Drm,
race,

1201
00:47:38,051 --> 00:47:38,800
Penn Plaza.
Yeah.

1202
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:39,790
It's not mine.
It's,

1203
00:47:39,791 --> 00:47:41,880
they use it for Jesse Jackson back in 
the day.

1204
00:47:41,881 --> 00:47:44,560
It's a good time.
And he's been outed as a race pamper.

1205
00:47:44,561 --> 00:47:45,394
I mean they've talked to people's,
like famously come to organizations and 

1206
00:47:50,501 --> 00:47:54,280
said,
I am going to give you diversity courses

1207
00:47:54,610 --> 00:47:55,443
and you're going to pay me a certain 
amount of money or we're going to 

1208
00:47:56,981 --> 00:47:58,450
protest to the religion,
isn't it?

1209
00:47:58,570 --> 00:47:59,950
And they're in the priesthood.
Well,

1210
00:47:59,951 --> 00:48:04,000
it's people who like criticized and they
don't want it to hurt their business.

1211
00:48:04,001 --> 00:48:04,834
And when you get fun,
especially if you're dealing with an 

1212
00:48:06,671 --> 00:48:09,130
internet business,
Internet based businesses,

1213
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:10,200
you know like,
like,

1214
00:48:10,780 --> 00:48:12,700
like Google for example,
apple,

1215
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:14,950
classically liberal,
right?

1216
00:48:15,310 --> 00:48:16,920
You would say bluegrass.
Yeah.

1217
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:21,800
So very loving in in England,
liberal actually means and liberal in,

1218
00:48:21,820 --> 00:48:23,860
in the United States,
liberal means progressive.

1219
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:29,920
Well though I hate all these fucking 
arms is a nightmare.

1220
00:48:30,130 --> 00:48:32,470
It's taken me a long time to really be 
able to hammer out the,

1221
00:48:32,650 --> 00:48:34,390
you know,
the ins and outs ideologically of it.

1222
00:48:34,690 --> 00:48:38,020
And so I can explain it quite 
efficiently now because it's difficult.

1223
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:41,900
It's really dark about something like 
progressive thinking into,

1224
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:42,813
well not progressive thinking,
but rather affirmative action is that 

1225
00:48:45,220 --> 00:48:46,053
you're going to create a certain amount 
of racism by putting someone who's 

1226
00:48:49,130 --> 00:48:54,100
qualified in a position just because of 
their color in it is racist.

1227
00:48:54,130 --> 00:48:54,630
You're,
you're,

1228
00:48:54,630 --> 00:48:58,450
you're being discriminatory on the basis
of race white person.

1229
00:48:58,470 --> 00:49:01,030
Yeah.
That's racism by a racist.

1230
00:49:01,060 --> 00:49:04,480
But you go to the deep root of it and 
you've got to realize,

1231
00:49:04,481 --> 00:49:06,070
well there's some people that just,
they're,

1232
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:07,690
they're given a terrible hand of cards.

1233
00:49:07,690 --> 00:49:10,870
We've got to be able to figure out how 
to fix that hand of cards,

1234
00:49:11,140 --> 00:49:12,970
how to make it a little bit more 
balanced in our,

1235
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,350
in our cities.
How to make,

1236
00:49:14,351 --> 00:49:15,050
how do you do that?
I,

1237
00:49:15,050 --> 00:49:17,380
that's a good question.
There's one way to do it,

1238
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:20,770
but that's where it gets really crazy,
doesn't it?

1239
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:23,680
I don't know about that.
But if the people that are born in these

1240
00:49:23,681 --> 00:49:24,514
crime ridden communities and then get no
assistance whatsoever from the very 

1241
00:49:28,001 --> 00:49:28,834
government that sending billions of 
dollars overseas to assist these other 

1242
00:49:32,010 --> 00:49:34,330
cops helping them.
Absolutely.

1243
00:49:34,331 --> 00:49:36,610
Not against helping him.
I mean like the,

1244
00:49:36,730 --> 00:49:38,320
you know,
I'm not saying you know what you go hang

1245
00:49:38,470 --> 00:49:39,303
out.
So you know,

1246
00:49:39,340 --> 00:49:43,360
but anything you do has to start with 
them saying,

1247
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:46,180
I want to change.
Sure.

1248
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:48,310
And if they can't stop the,
if that's not damaged,

1249
00:49:48,311 --> 00:49:50,860
they're going to start with,
then you can do nothing for them.

1250
00:49:51,190 --> 00:49:53,170
Well,
they're happy where they on how they are

1251
00:49:53,171 --> 00:49:55,270
right now.
Then you can't change anything.

1252
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:58,110
All you'll do is throw good money off 
the bat and they'll know it that,

1253
00:49:58,140 --> 00:49:59,680
I mean like think about people who win 
the lottery.

1254
00:50:00,070 --> 00:50:00,940
Did they,
are they happy?

1255
00:50:01,780 --> 00:50:04,060
Some of them,
most days they ruins our lives,

1256
00:50:04,061 --> 00:50:05,560
doesn't it?
That's what they say.

1257
00:50:05,650 --> 00:50:08,770
Relationships feel like the people who 
write those articles are always sad.

1258
00:50:08,771 --> 00:50:11,380
They didn't run the lottery.
So maybe you could talk to shit.

1259
00:50:11,820 --> 00:50:12,653
I think there's probably a lot of dudes 
out there that are just straight ball 

1260
00:50:15,461 --> 00:50:16,294
and having a great time.
It's a new thing that you will have 

1261
00:50:18,590 --> 00:50:20,350
value.
I don't know if that's always true.

1262
00:50:20,620 --> 00:50:21,453
Most of the time it is.
I think it takes 100 person and it may 

1263
00:50:23,201 --> 00:50:25,750
me if it's like a super amount of money,
what you,

1264
00:50:25,780 --> 00:50:27,230
maybe you just got to ease into it.

1265
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:30,860
Maybe it's one of those things and she 
went $100 million and you just like,

1266
00:50:31,250 --> 00:50:33,830
pretend you only want a hundred grand 
spend that.

1267
00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:36,530
But uh,
I got to start slow.

1268
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:38,900
Don't get a Ferrari.
I'm not saying we don't have a Camaro,

1269
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:39,950
you know,
you got to help these people.

1270
00:50:39,951 --> 00:50:40,784
But they have to,
you have to begin from a position where 

1271
00:50:42,021 --> 00:50:42,561
they say,
you know what,

1272
00:50:42,561 --> 00:50:44,530
look,
I want to help because if,

1273
00:50:44,531 --> 00:50:46,820
if there's something going,
I don't want to change,

1274
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:49,330
well then they're not going to change.
But I understand that.

1275
00:50:49,331 --> 00:50:50,164
But I meet a lot of them change,
don't even understand how they would go 

1276
00:50:52,761 --> 00:50:53,594
about changing.
And they're constantly surrounded and 

1277
00:50:56,001 --> 00:50:56,834
reinforced by all these people around 
them that are in jail or committing 

1278
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:02,330
crimes.
Black Youtube is occasionally in,

1279
00:51:02,331 --> 00:51:03,190
a lot of them are like,
you know,

1280
00:51:03,770 --> 00:51:05,180
they do blame a lot of stuff on the 
white man.

1281
00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:06,920
They said the white man will keep you 
down and stuff like that.

1282
00:51:07,850 --> 00:51:08,920
That's,
it's not,

1283
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:12,313
listen,
if this was a white guy and he was at 

1284
00:51:13,761 --> 00:51:14,630
the Black Man's,
hold me down,

1285
00:51:14,631 --> 00:51:15,464
you'd be like,
shut up,

1286
00:51:16,070 --> 00:51:17,420
shut up.
You wouldn't accept it.

1287
00:51:17,690 --> 00:51:18,980
And if you'll get to accept that from 
them,

1288
00:51:18,981 --> 00:51:19,814
that's you being a racist.
Treat them like you would treat white 

1289
00:51:21,801 --> 00:51:22,634
people.
If this was white people sitting around 

1290
00:51:23,751 --> 00:51:24,920
going,
I'm not gonna do anything.

1291
00:51:24,921 --> 00:51:27,470
I'm going to join the gang.
I think what the black man's,

1292
00:51:27,471 --> 00:51:28,850
all the Jews are trying to hold me down 
and something.

1293
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:29,960
Yeah,
you didn't let me finish.

1294
00:51:29,961 --> 00:51:33,560
I wasn't saying that white people are in
fact holding black people down.

1295
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:36,650
I was saying that idea of the white man,
like they have this mandate,

1296
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:38,500
we've got to hold the black people sound
probably dressed.

1297
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:40,880
That's all right.
It's a standard argument.

1298
00:51:41,030 --> 00:51:43,850
I don't think there's a coalition of,
I know,

1299
00:51:43,950 --> 00:51:45,590
I mean without,
in the hedge.

1300
00:51:45,620 --> 00:51:46,970
Yeah.
It's a sad thought.

1301
00:51:46,990 --> 00:51:47,823
This option.
I think that there absolutely was 

1302
00:51:50,810 --> 00:51:51,643
certain times,
I mean there's absolutely neighborhoods 

1303
00:51:53,031 --> 00:51:54,980
at black people were not allowed to buy 
real estate.

1304
00:51:54,981 --> 00:51:55,814
There's absolutely a systematic racism 
and there was still a little racist 

1305
00:51:57,760 --> 00:51:58,320
around,
you know,

1306
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:00,350
I'm not,
I'm not saying it's not justified.

1307
00:52:00,380 --> 00:52:01,350
That's the thing,
right?

1308
00:52:01,430 --> 00:52:03,470
I'm not saying it's not justified and 
that's,

1309
00:52:03,471 --> 00:52:04,304
I think that,
I think that's where like the argument 

1310
00:52:05,631 --> 00:52:06,464
goes off the rails because they go,
what do you mean all this stuff's 

1311
00:52:07,851 --> 00:52:08,241
happening.
Yeah,

1312
00:52:08,241 --> 00:52:09,074
it has happened and they're all racist,
but you don't have to let that hold you 

1313
00:52:12,231 --> 00:52:13,120
back.
No,

1314
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:15,170
you definitely don't.
That is up to it.

1315
00:52:15,380 --> 00:52:17,390
Yeah,
I think they need examples.

1316
00:52:17,410 --> 00:52:18,243
You know,
I think more examples and more role 

1317
00:52:19,281 --> 00:52:20,480
models in that direction.

1318
00:52:20,540 --> 00:52:21,440
I've actually,
I've seen,

1319
00:52:21,470 --> 00:52:23,210
I can't remember the guy's name,
but I remember seeing this,

1320
00:52:23,211 --> 00:52:24,044
uh,
of this black doctor doing a speaking 

1321
00:52:25,701 --> 00:52:26,740
tour at,
um,

1322
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:27,643
was he a real doctor or a chiropractor?
Then all of the differences then 

1323
00:52:31,250 --> 00:52:34,930
chiropractors aren't really,
doctors just found that out recent.

1324
00:52:34,940 --> 00:52:35,840
Really?
Oh it's real.

1325
00:52:35,860 --> 00:52:37,520
Oh yeah.
They don't go to medical school.

1326
00:52:38,420 --> 00:52:39,950
Yeah.
And that fucking crazy.

1327
00:52:40,190 --> 00:52:43,450
I didn't know about that until I'm 
having her on the podcast.

1328
00:52:43,470 --> 00:52:45,350
The woman who wrote that article,
dude,

1329
00:52:45,380 --> 00:52:48,520
they kill people died from that and they
died.

1330
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:53,360
There was some recent thing that a red 
band sent me about some playboy playmate

1331
00:52:53,361 --> 00:52:54,194
who died because the doctor or the 
chiropractor adjusted her neck and she 

1332
00:52:56,871 --> 00:52:58,430
fucking died.
Fuck.

1333
00:52:58,490 --> 00:53:00,860
People die every year.
They do it to babies,

1334
00:53:00,861 --> 00:53:02,450
man.
They had just babies.

1335
00:53:02,570 --> 00:53:05,300
There's people that do like chiropractic
adjustments on babies.

1336
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:06,313
Their bones aren't even fully formed.
Their bones are soft and these assholes 

1337
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:12,890
are manipulating them.
I'm really glad you told me that.

1338
00:53:12,891 --> 00:53:15,440
Cause I got two and a half year old son.
I mean nothing wrong.

1339
00:53:15,441 --> 00:53:16,274
Playboy model,
Katie May's death caused by 

1340
00:53:17,421 --> 00:53:19,640
chiropractor.
Autopsy fines.

1341
00:53:19,940 --> 00:53:23,090
Scroll up so I could read that.
Fucking this nonsense.

1342
00:53:23,210 --> 00:53:26,190
I thought they were doctors.
I thought when a doctor tells

1343
00:53:26,190 --> 00:53:26,580
me,
yeah,

1344
00:53:26,580 --> 00:53:29,650
when you say Doctor Mike,
I thought it was a doctor who died.

1345
00:53:29,660 --> 00:53:31,770
You went to medical school and learned 
how to be a chiropractor.

1346
00:53:31,830 --> 00:53:33,940
No,
I can't believe you're allowed to do and

1347
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:36,330
don't settle down.
Ready for this.

1348
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:38,910
The guy who invented it was a magnetic 
healer.

1349
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:40,930
Okay.
The guy invented Cairo.

1350
00:53:40,980 --> 00:53:43,170
The,
there's all this like subluxation is all

1351
00:53:43,171 --> 00:53:45,010
these words they use.
They have cleared a total.

1352
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:46,740
Yes.
Entirely fake.

1353
00:53:46,830 --> 00:53:47,663
Not only that,
but the guy who invented it very 

1354
00:53:49,561 --> 00:53:52,370
possibly was murdered by his son.
That's a suspicion.

1355
00:53:52,371 --> 00:53:56,130
His son ran him over for sure and they 
think he might've done it on purpose and

1356
00:53:56,131 --> 00:53:56,964
then his son ran him over with a car and
then took over the business and his son 

1357
00:53:59,461 --> 00:54:01,350
was totally shady.
Pieces of shit.

1358
00:54:01,470 --> 00:54:03,260
We'll call it a fraud.
Well,

1359
00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:05,820
you could have been an accident,
a tragic accident and the love dad,

1360
00:54:05,940 --> 00:54:06,773
but the allegation is that he ran over 
his dad to take over the family 

1361
00:54:10,381 --> 00:54:11,214
business.

1362
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:14,340
It is not real at all and that is not a 
real science.

1363
00:54:14,341 --> 00:54:17,170
There's no science to support it.
There's no it's,

1364
00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:22,020
but the crazy thing is it's so accepted 
that insurance pays for this shit.

1365
00:54:22,380 --> 00:54:23,213
She had some clotting and went to the 
hospital where they tried to do super 

1366
00:54:25,770 --> 00:54:28,110
cheap procedures,
but she passed away.

1367
00:54:28,470 --> 00:54:33,470
So this guy adjusting her her neck and 
they tore her verbal,

1368
00:54:33,750 --> 00:54:37,500
her vertebral artery.
Did you haven't look ahead local.

1369
00:54:37,501 --> 00:54:39,510
So no man,
when you're adjusting you,

1370
00:54:39,511 --> 00:54:40,344
you to understand there's bones in there
and as violent jutting if you're a 

1371
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:47,430
tender person or if you have some sort 
of vulnerability.

1372
00:54:47,431 --> 00:54:48,300
Yeah,
model.

1373
00:54:48,870 --> 00:54:53,850
They tore her fucking article or artery 
rather than article and subsequently cut

1374
00:54:53,851 --> 00:54:58,290
off blood flow to her brain.
Her death was ruled accidental.

1375
00:54:58,860 --> 00:55:00,450
What in the fuck can we,
can we,

1376
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:03,760
can we give these people stopped somehow
scared.

1377
00:55:03,870 --> 00:55:06,900
If a doctor does is this is what 
confuses the shit out of him.

1378
00:55:07,170 --> 00:55:09,180
All these guys that have called 
themselves doctor.

1379
00:55:09,181 --> 00:55:10,014
When I talked to them,
I thought they were an actual fucking 

1380
00:55:11,821 --> 00:55:12,654
doctor.
Like I went to a place like this is 

1381
00:55:14,220 --> 00:55:16,440
doctor Pete docter.
Pete's going to work on you,

1382
00:55:16,441 --> 00:55:17,251
Doctor Pete's.
Dot.

1383
00:55:17,251 --> 00:55:19,670
A fucking doctor.
You mean?

1384
00:55:19,860 --> 00:55:23,070
It's a 100% fake.
The what is the article?

1385
00:55:23,071 --> 00:55:26,670
Pull up that article like chiropractors 
are bullshit because I want to give that

1386
00:55:26,671 --> 00:55:28,590
lady prop.
She's going to come on my podcast.

1387
00:55:28,620 --> 00:55:29,820
Oh,
so she's a,

1388
00:55:29,910 --> 00:55:32,130
she calls herself the science base.
Yvette.

1389
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:35,400
The science babe,
don't she has the PSI babe.

1390
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:36,860
She sounds awesome.
Uh,

1391
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:38,940
yes.
Pro-Science I'm very excited.

1392
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:43,010
Very excited to have on the article was,
uh,

1393
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:44,193
it was actually synchronicity because it
was a conversation that I was having 

1394
00:55:46,530 --> 00:55:47,363
with Steve Rinella as a friend of mine a
couple of weeks ago when he was talking 

1395
00:55:50,881 --> 00:55:51,714
about,
uh,

1396
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:54,750
his brother has got some issue with 
atrophy and have his arm.

1397
00:55:54,750 --> 00:55:56,190
He's been going to a chiropractor.
And I said,

1398
00:55:56,191 --> 00:55:59,430
I think chiropractors are bullshit.
And so after the podcast,

1399
00:55:59,790 --> 00:56:01,340
I smoked a joint and I was thinking 
about what it was.

1400
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:04,620
I being too hard on Chiropractors,
I'd be in a deck.

1401
00:56:04,621 --> 00:56:06,630
So then I started researching 
chiropractors.

1402
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:07,473
Yeah.
And I found all this crazy shit about 

1403
00:56:08,971 --> 00:56:11,010
the fucking magnetic healers and all 
this stuff.

1404
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:13,470
Here's the article.
Chiropractors are bullshit.

1405
00:56:14,460 --> 00:56:16,950
You shouldn't trust him with your spine 
or any other part of your body.

1406
00:56:17,070 --> 00:56:18,480
And what is her name that she wrote 
this.

1407
00:56:18,510 --> 00:56:21,570
So we can give her some how do events,
Yvette.

1408
00:56:22,190 --> 00:56:24,440
And here we go d at Tremont

1409
00:56:24,870 --> 00:56:28,720
in Trimont.
It's d apostrophe capital,

1410
00:56:28,721 --> 00:56:30,220
a low,
low level d.

1411
00:56:30,250 --> 00:56:31,083
What does his bullshit,
not American spelling or possibly 

1412
00:56:34,181 --> 00:56:36,160
Canadian Quebec call.
Hello?

1413
00:56:36,470 --> 00:56:41,470
Lowercase d apostrophe large capital.
I'm in favor of banning French as well.

1414
00:56:43,510 --> 00:56:45,660
I like French people.
None of the language.

1415
00:56:45,670 --> 00:56:46,630
The food.
Do you know the French?

1416
00:56:46,631 --> 00:56:47,740
But we could bang up.
Sounds good.

1417
00:56:47,741 --> 00:56:48,574
If there's,
there's one accepted form of bigotry in 

1418
00:56:49,551 --> 00:56:50,470
England.
This is against the French.

1419
00:56:50,471 --> 00:56:51,640
So fuck French.
Oh really?

1420
00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:52,420
Oh,
you're allowed to?

1421
00:56:52,420 --> 00:56:54,370
Yeah.
How come you can do that?

1422
00:56:54,371 --> 00:56:56,720
Because we lost the hundred years war.
Uh,

1423
00:56:56,760 --> 00:56:57,930
so it's an England thing.
Yeah.

1424
00:56:57,980 --> 00:56:58,813
We spent a hundred years kicking the 
shit out of French and then God 

1425
00:57:01,871 --> 00:57:04,930
intervened to save.
Yeah.

1426
00:57:05,540 --> 00:57:07,810
Frances having a Ho well you haven't let
me finish this.

1427
00:57:07,811 --> 00:57:10,790
Talk about the doctor cause it basically
like I know that they're there.

1428
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:12,640
They were probably gonna be a lot of 
blind people who sat there going,

1429
00:57:12,641 --> 00:57:15,160
well holy shit,
my whole life I've been like,

1430
00:57:15,220 --> 00:57:18,030
I know that the white man's keeping me 
down and stuff like that,

1431
00:57:18,031 --> 00:57:19,930
but this is,
this isn't all coming from me.

1432
00:57:19,930 --> 00:57:21,490
That's the thing.
I'm not the fucking expert here.

1433
00:57:21,820 --> 00:57:23,980
This is coming.
I wish I could remember this guy's name.

1434
00:57:23,981 --> 00:57:26,560
It was like a couple of years ago I 
watched this guy doing the speaking tour

1435
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:27,820
and he,
he was,

1436
00:57:27,821 --> 00:57:28,990
um,
a black doctor,

1437
00:57:28,991 --> 00:57:33,130
but he's like a phd in business studies 
or something like that.

1438
00:57:33,131 --> 00:57:34,150
It wasn't like,
you know,

1439
00:57:34,151 --> 00:57:36,080
even though a chiropractor,
um,

1440
00:57:36,250 --> 00:57:37,090
but he,
I was,

1441
00:57:37,140 --> 00:57:37,973
I was,
I was absolutely loving his speech to a 

1442
00:57:39,551 --> 00:57:41,440
bunch of kids in school cause he was 
just saying,

1443
00:57:41,441 --> 00:57:43,390
look,
if you drop outs,

1444
00:57:43,750 --> 00:57:45,520
you won't get to where you want to go.
I mean,

1445
00:57:45,521 --> 00:57:46,990
you've got to look at it.
Just look at sensible.

1446
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,510
You just look at it through in like an 
Aristotelian Lens.

1447
00:57:49,511 --> 00:57:51,250
You are what you do.
Okay,

1448
00:57:51,251 --> 00:57:52,450
what do you want?
Where do you want to end up?

1449
00:57:52,660 --> 00:57:54,520
You will end up as a scientist.
Okay,

1450
00:57:54,730 --> 00:57:57,340
well if you drop out of school,
that's that goal off the table.

1451
00:57:57,460 --> 00:57:58,930
You can't just have a scientist by 
training at school.

1452
00:57:58,931 --> 00:58:02,500
So no matter how much you hate school,
you just got to fucking stick it out.

1453
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:03,833
You've got to get,
you want to do something that's 

1454
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:05,770
involved.
If you want to get,

1455
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:07,210
if you want to get their scientists,
so you plot it on,

1456
00:58:07,211 --> 00:58:07,630
get her.
Okay,

1457
00:58:07,630 --> 00:58:10,480
so I've got to get to college and go to 
know university,

1458
00:58:10,481 --> 00:58:12,730
get phd.
Then I've got to make sure that I've,

1459
00:58:12,731 --> 00:58:13,564
you know,
I've done all the right courses to get 

1460
00:58:14,201 --> 00:58:16,000
to the right field.
You've got to plot the sale.

1461
00:58:16,690 --> 00:58:18,040
If you drop out at any point.
Well,

1462
00:58:18,041 --> 00:58:18,521
there we go.
That's,

1463
00:58:18,521 --> 00:58:19,354
you screwed your life plan there.
So you're going to have to figure out 

1464
00:58:21,311 --> 00:58:22,144
something to do know.
I know because I did exactly the same 

1465
00:58:23,231 --> 00:58:24,750
thing.
There's just no getting around it.

1466
00:58:24,770 --> 00:58:26,590
No one can.
No one can give that to you.

1467
00:58:26,680 --> 00:58:29,650
You've got to give it to yourself.
That's what empowerment is.

1468
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:31,240
If you want to be empowered,
you've just got to go,

1469
00:58:31,241 --> 00:58:32,030
you know what?
Let's,

1470
00:58:32,030 --> 00:58:33,760
let's just assume the white man hate 
shit.

1471
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:34,833
Let's just assume he does.
Every white men just assume we're all 

1472
00:58:37,391 --> 00:58:39,010
fucking racist.
Why would you assume that?

1473
00:58:39,020 --> 00:58:40,570
That gets a foolish thing to,
sorry.

1474
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:43,060
This is worst case stone.
Let's think about worst case scenario.

1475
00:58:43,090 --> 00:58:44,800
Every one person's racist.
They won't hold you back,

1476
00:58:44,801 --> 00:58:48,280
but legally they can't.
So you might be thinking,

1477
00:58:48,281 --> 00:58:50,200
where I came,
I was going to be some bigotry,

1478
00:58:50,201 --> 00:58:52,000
so well you can do,
you're going to work harder.

1479
00:58:52,210 --> 00:58:53,043
That's the only way you can do.
If you get what if you want to get to 

1480
00:58:54,641 --> 00:58:55,474
where you got to go,
you've got to work kind of living in a 

1481
00:58:56,861 --> 00:59:00,610
paranoid world where you're done,
I want person hates you.

1482
00:59:00,940 --> 00:59:02,950
I'm not suggesting shot really even at 
hand.

1483
00:59:02,951 --> 00:59:04,750
I'm not suggesting you should actually 
do that.

1484
00:59:04,930 --> 00:59:05,763
Well,
I didn't bring it up because that's the 

1485
00:59:06,551 --> 00:59:08,020
worst case scenario for them.
That's the,

1486
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:09,700
that's what let's say the White Man's 
trying to hold me back.

1487
00:59:09,730 --> 00:59:10,191
Okay.
Let's see.

1488
00:59:10,191 --> 00:59:11,860
Yes,
let's just take that as a premise.

1489
00:59:11,861 --> 00:59:12,700
Right.
Okay.

1490
00:59:12,730 --> 00:59:14,200
But does he actually,
you know,

1491
00:59:14,201 --> 00:59:15,850
he's not,
I mean they do actually have affirmative

1492
00:59:15,851 --> 00:59:16,684
action for your university and stuff.
So even if we still assume that this is 

1493
00:59:19,571 --> 00:59:22,070
somehow owe him being racist and hating

1494
00:59:22,070 --> 00:59:23,780
black people,
you can still go,

1495
00:59:23,781 --> 00:59:24,614
well I can still take advantage of that.
If what I need is these grades in the 

1496
00:59:26,971 --> 00:59:29,780
subjects go and get those grades in 
those subjects.

1497
00:59:29,781 --> 00:59:31,190
In fact Yuma thing.
Well Christ,

1498
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:32,233
I'm actually good for the great up just 
in case the white man tries to screw me 

1499
00:59:34,281 --> 00:59:35,450
even harder.
You know,

1500
00:59:35,570 --> 00:59:36,740
I'm going to work even harder.
You think?

1501
00:59:36,741 --> 00:59:37,910
Well Christ that means you got to work 
hard.

1502
00:59:37,911 --> 00:59:38,690
Yeah.
You've got to work hard.

1503
00:59:38,690 --> 00:59:41,750
I love the term the white man is,
if they're usually white man,

1504
00:59:41,780 --> 00:59:42,591
the white man,
they,

1505
00:59:42,591 --> 00:59:45,080
they're not unified in anything other 
than keeping black people down.

1506
00:59:45,380 --> 00:59:47,510
Like there's people brother down.
Cause you know,

1507
00:59:47,511 --> 00:59:48,344
I mean like when he gets to the 
presidency clearly are like in dispute 

1508
00:59:51,981 --> 00:59:53,540
over everything.
Yeah.

1509
00:59:53,690 --> 00:59:58,690
Like everything from top to bottom,
didn't the new center,

1510
00:59:58,840 --> 00:59:59,673
but it's the new thing that keeps 
getting the woke centrists the 

1511
01:00:02,451 --> 01:00:04,190
centrists,
the new center,

1512
01:00:04,270 --> 01:00:05,103
the,
the extremes of cancer and we should 

1513
01:00:05,871 --> 01:00:06,704
just ignore them.

1514
01:00:06,830 --> 01:00:08,840
Yeah.
Well that's the center.

1515
01:00:08,841 --> 01:00:11,750
Sounds ridiculous to every,
it all sounds ridiculous,

1516
01:00:12,230 --> 01:00:13,063
but ask yourself,
would you rather towards the bench Pero 

1517
01:00:14,151 --> 01:00:16,880
of Richard Spencer Bench Bureau.
Exactly.

1518
01:00:17,090 --> 01:00:19,120
We'd rather talk to me or need suck.
He's in.

1519
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:20,820
Well maybe not need somebody to talk to 
her.

1520
01:00:20,910 --> 01:00:21,743
Okay.
She's bad example route me or someone 

1521
01:00:23,451 --> 01:00:24,500
who says that,
you know,

1522
01:00:24,501 --> 01:00:26,630
all white people oppressing our black 
people.

1523
01:00:26,780 --> 01:00:31,340
I always want to talk to someone who 
like has these extreme beliefs.

1524
01:00:31,341 --> 01:00:33,720
Like I believe she doesn't mean people 
that go on.

1525
01:00:33,950 --> 01:00:36,410
I want to know like what goes on in her 
head.

1526
01:00:36,411 --> 01:00:37,244
I want to know why she thinks that 
there's something wrong with being 

1527
01:00:39,621 --> 01:00:42,780
mailed to the point where like every 
male has toxic.

1528
01:00:44,320 --> 01:00:46,640
I mean I'm talking about for the plug 
political candidates,

1529
01:00:46,641 --> 01:00:47,474
you know,
would you rather,

1530
01:00:47,780 --> 01:00:49,790
would you rather have two people who are
relatively moderate,

1531
01:00:49,820 --> 01:00:52,890
relatively close to the center you're 
talking about political candidates took,

1532
01:00:52,950 --> 01:00:53,180
yeah.

1533
01:00:53,180 --> 01:00:55,130
Sorry,
I should specified you get there.

1534
01:00:55,410 --> 01:00:56,630
Well,
because that's the,

1535
01:00:56,650 --> 01:00:57,401
the whole,
the,

1536
01:00:57,401 --> 01:01:00,320
the center is the political sphere is 
it?

1537
01:01:00,350 --> 01:01:01,183
I see.
I feel like it's an ideology more than 

1538
01:01:02,361 --> 01:01:05,750
it is a political,
how you live your life more than how you

1539
01:01:05,751 --> 01:01:06,540
vote.
Yeah.

1540
01:01:06,540 --> 01:01:07,373
It's not like a,
an ideology in and of itself and you've 

1541
01:01:08,781 --> 01:01:09,860
got like center left center,
right?

1542
01:01:09,861 --> 01:01:10,694
They've got similar but different 
ideological traditions and I mean it's 

1543
01:01:13,881 --> 01:01:17,090
like it's basically the,
the problem is when you say it's someone

1544
01:01:17,091 --> 01:01:17,924
else's fault,
that's the worst thing you can do 

1545
01:01:19,570 --> 01:01:20,403
because you're disempowering yourself.
Except when it clearly is someone 

1546
01:01:22,761 --> 01:01:23,750
else's.
Sometimes it is.

1547
01:01:23,900 --> 01:01:25,730
Sometimes it does,
but most of the time it's not.

1548
01:01:25,731 --> 01:01:27,310
Most of the time it's your own fault.
Yeah.

1549
01:01:27,590 --> 01:01:28,423
Like the victim mentality that you were 
talking about when we're talking about 

1550
01:01:30,501 --> 01:01:33,260
like hardcore feminists that are 
constantly blame men for thing.

1551
01:01:33,500 --> 01:01:36,530
But the problem is like what is it like 
being a chick?

1552
01:01:36,531 --> 01:01:38,750
It's probably fucking terrible.
It's probably,

1553
01:01:38,751 --> 01:01:39,584
and not always,
I mean in the terms when the term that 

1554
01:01:42,500 --> 01:01:43,910
you didn't let me finish.
Fuck.

1555
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:49,200
What I'm saying is when women are 
constantly worried about being victims,

1556
01:01:49,821 --> 01:01:51,170
right?
Like women are worried.

1557
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:52,330
Yeah.
You show him.

1558
01:01:52,340 --> 01:01:53,173
Yeah.
I've talked to some that talked about 

1559
01:01:54,441 --> 01:01:56,020
like driving home,
they're scared.

1560
01:01:56,180 --> 01:01:59,060
They get nervous when they're walking 
into certain areas at night.

1561
01:01:59,210 --> 01:02:00,043
And the way that a man doesn't.
This is interesting cause that's the 

1562
01:02:01,581 --> 01:02:03,650
same opinion that Saudi Arabians,
half of the West,

1563
01:02:04,310 --> 01:02:05,143
the house would you mean you've given me
the feminist narrative that all women 

1564
01:02:07,071 --> 01:02:08,360
are constantly afraid of men?
No,

1565
01:02:08,361 --> 01:02:11,960
I think a lot of women are though.
But I'm not saying they're not,

1566
01:02:11,961 --> 01:02:14,150
but like you know,
let you know when you say right,

1567
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:16,400
the other women talk to women are afraid
of men.

1568
01:02:16,590 --> 01:02:17,423
That's also a feminist narrative.
That's also the Wahhabi narrative from 

1569
01:02:21,151 --> 01:02:22,590
Saudi Arabia.
And that's why they have to go,

1570
01:02:22,591 --> 01:02:24,930
well that means all women aren't allowed
out and they go wet burgers.

1571
01:02:25,230 --> 01:02:26,360
They can't.
They've got to reflect.

1572
01:02:26,370 --> 01:02:28,280
We become invisible.
So I men aren't going to predict.

1573
01:02:28,420 --> 01:02:31,710
We have a very ancient culture and in 
that culture,

1574
01:02:31,711 --> 01:02:34,500
women are treated ridiculously different
than what you need.

1575
01:02:34,501 --> 01:02:39,501
They don't Wahhabism arrived in the 18th
century with Abdul Wahab.

1576
01:02:39,870 --> 01:02:41,490
Uh,
an old 1700.

1577
01:02:41,491 --> 01:02:44,430
That's pretty ancient to an American.
Yeah.

1578
01:02:44,520 --> 01:02:46,020
And not to anyone.
I'm American man.

1579
01:02:46,080 --> 01:02:48,030
Okay.
But I'm not a snitch culture.

1580
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:52,290
My point is old as fuck.
My point is,

1581
01:02:52,780 --> 01:02:55,710
okay,
the point 1776.

1582
01:02:55,860 --> 01:02:56,250
Yeah,
exactly.

1583
01:02:56,250 --> 01:02:57,630
Is this,
none of this was what like 17,

1584
01:02:57,631 --> 01:03:01,110
18 or something like that.
But see it's older by four years.

1585
01:03:01,111 --> 01:03:02,370
This country is older.
By four years,

1586
01:03:02,460 --> 01:03:03,630
country exist.
Not the full 70,

1587
01:03:03,631 --> 01:03:04,464
76.
It just wasn't worth nothing I'm saying 

1588
01:03:05,761 --> 01:03:08,040
existed.
It's the same people here,

1589
01:03:08,041 --> 01:03:10,470
a bunch of fucking campers hundreds of 
years before that.

1590
01:03:10,471 --> 01:03:12,300
Like the people that walk the 
Appalachian trail.

1591
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:13,333
I have so many,
but this is way newer and way more 

1592
01:03:15,271 --> 01:03:18,230
cancerous as well.
There's a lot of great stuff about point

1593
01:03:18,290 --> 01:03:23,290
being there is a very different 
classification of women versus men in,

1594
01:03:24,210 --> 01:03:25,890
in Wahhabi Islam.
Right?

1595
01:03:25,950 --> 01:03:28,680
It's the same theory behind it.
They say exactly the same woods.

1596
01:03:28,920 --> 01:03:29,753
What do you mean?

1597
01:03:32,070 --> 01:03:33,210
Yeah.
But some women are,

1598
01:03:33,300 --> 01:03:34,133
I mean like in certain circumstances,
what I'm trying to get at is that the 

1599
01:03:37,771 --> 01:03:38,604
way women think about men,
it's very different than the way men 

1600
01:03:40,321 --> 01:03:41,154
think about women.
A man does not walk to a group of women 

1601
01:03:43,291 --> 01:03:44,124
and worry about being raped.
A man does not walk through the streets 

1602
01:03:47,041 --> 01:03:47,874
at night and worry.
Some woman's going to come out of the 

1603
01:03:49,050 --> 01:03:49,883
darkness and grab his ass,
but a woman doesn't walk into a 

1604
01:03:52,060 --> 01:03:53,850
courthouse,
a divorce proceeding and think,

1605
01:03:53,851 --> 01:03:55,650
I'm gonna lose everything.
That's true.

1606
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:58,650
That's true.
Unless you're Roseanne and you're dating

1607
01:03:58,651 --> 01:03:59,620
Tom Arnold,
right?

1608
01:03:59,780 --> 01:04:01,840
Boom.
She's still paying that again,

1609
01:04:02,690 --> 01:04:03,523
one for the team,
except for that one exception that 

1610
01:04:04,681 --> 01:04:06,450
proves the rule.
Then 90% of the time,

1611
01:04:06,690 --> 01:04:07,680
the woman,
I mean not,

1612
01:04:07,980 --> 01:04:09,390
I mean you,
you hit horrific.

1613
01:04:09,391 --> 01:04:12,450
So he told some of the,
you get some horror stories where,

1614
01:04:12,660 --> 01:04:14,930
I mean the women's men's rights 
activists,

1615
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:18,570
I know these terms,
I'm immersed in it all day,

1616
01:04:18,600 --> 01:04:19,440
but people aren't.

1617
01:04:19,910 --> 01:04:21,750
They listen,
people that have listened to us,

1618
01:04:21,751 --> 01:04:24,030
a lot of them are not getting your ass 
off the sofa.

1619
01:04:24,090 --> 01:04:28,410
Stop watching tv or go online and just 
be immersed in that world.

1620
01:04:28,411 --> 01:04:29,730
Now go outside.
No.

1621
01:04:29,731 --> 01:04:30,960
Why?
You don't have to be an,

1622
01:04:31,170 --> 01:04:35,370
you don't have to be knowing that Mra 
thousands of pounds to come here to tell

1623
01:04:35,371 --> 01:04:37,680
you what an MRI.
The other thing is this thing,

1624
01:04:37,681 --> 01:04:38,461
right?
This is,

1625
01:04:38,461 --> 01:04:39,294
this is on the,
I say this with the greatest respect 

1626
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:43,073
from the more venerable generations,
the mine who are more used to the 

1627
01:04:45,391 --> 01:04:46,224
television.
People don't watch TV anymore and they 

1628
01:04:47,701 --> 01:04:48,960
won't get back to it.
Yeah,

1629
01:04:48,961 --> 01:04:49,794
I think you're right.
I think it's dying and we've got the 

1630
01:04:51,181 --> 01:04:52,710
statistics to prove it.
I've done videos on it.

1631
01:04:52,830 --> 01:04:54,420
We've got all the stuff,
the sources in the stats.

1632
01:04:54,660 --> 01:04:56,520
It's only the older generations.
I mean like in Britain,

1633
01:04:56,850 --> 01:04:59,550
all of the TV channels,
channel full was the young hip,

1634
01:04:59,551 --> 01:05:03,720
cool TV channel when I was young,
the average age of the vns 44 well,

1635
01:05:03,780 --> 01:05:06,810
once they found out that old dude had 
been fucking kids for all those years,

1636
01:05:07,160 --> 01:05:11,840
Jimmy savile think that lost a lot of 
faith.

1637
01:05:11,850 --> 01:05:13,770
That's not the reason there's TV 
watching.

1638
01:05:13,771 --> 01:05:15,000
This isn't,
that's not the reason.

1639
01:05:15,001 --> 01:05:17,300
The reason is it's not the real Jesus 
Christ.

1640
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:18,560
Sorry,
sorry.

1641
01:05:18,580 --> 01:05:19,413
Yeah.
You got to say,

1642
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:21,340
I've been dealing with some people who 
were fucking idiots.

1643
01:05:21,430 --> 01:05:22,300
I get it.
You know,

1644
01:05:22,301 --> 01:05:24,250
and I've,
I've had to be like really,

1645
01:05:24,251 --> 01:05:25,084
really specific because they were there.
There was a group of people online who 

1646
01:05:27,581 --> 01:05:29,530
know that I'm right and they don't like 
that I'm right.

1647
01:05:29,590 --> 01:05:30,540
They don't like you.
Right?

1648
01:05:30,580 --> 01:05:31,930
Oh No,
they hate that.

1649
01:05:31,931 --> 01:05:32,764
I'm right.
We're talking about Anita Sarkeesian 

1650
01:05:33,340 --> 01:05:34,480
again,
have fun.

1651
01:05:35,470 --> 01:05:38,770
They hate me and I don't want to give 
them anymore ammunition.

1652
01:05:38,771 --> 01:05:39,301
Nice.
Sorry.

1653
01:05:39,301 --> 01:05:42,610
Bad that she's not defending herself or 
she doesn't have the opportunity to,

1654
01:05:42,840 --> 01:05:43,673
she when she,
when she called me a piece of shit in 

1655
01:05:45,071 --> 01:05:48,310
the garbage human,
I had said nothing up until that point.

1656
01:05:48,450 --> 01:05:49,720
She yelled back,
I just want to talk.

1657
01:05:50,110 --> 01:05:50,650
And she was like,
oh,

1658
01:05:50,650 --> 01:05:51,483
whatever dude.
And it's just like I came all this way 

1659
01:05:53,800 --> 01:05:55,990
to hear what you had to say and all you 
could do is insult me.

1660
01:05:55,991 --> 01:06:00,991
That was the rehash this Jesus Christ.
It's a,

1661
01:06:01,900 --> 01:06:04,780
I've been personally slighted.
I get it.

1662
01:06:04,980 --> 01:06:05,321
No,
I mean,

1663
01:06:05,321 --> 01:06:07,290
I think I'm being defamed all across the
Internet now.

1664
01:06:07,300 --> 01:06:08,133
There's a,
there's a narrative going around the 

1665
01:06:08,861 --> 01:06:12,100
progressive journalists.
Those already been debunked by an actual

1666
01:06:12,101 --> 01:06:16,150
journalist called Tim Pool.
And the video evidence of the event that

1667
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:21,170
I personally took that the ice storm,
the stage and started screaming abuse.

1668
01:06:21,171 --> 01:06:25,020
Or they're saying that they'll probably,
who was saying that journalists and like

1669
01:06:25,030 --> 01:06:28,020
the journalists like pull up of an 
actual artwork.

1670
01:06:28,170 --> 01:06:30,760
Tell me an actual article that said 
there probably aren't any yet,

1671
01:06:31,150 --> 01:06:31,983
but I bet you tomorrow or going on there
articles about me and some of them will 

1672
01:06:35,711 --> 01:06:37,330
say something like,
I abused her.

1673
01:06:37,950 --> 01:06:42,160
Pause some hobbies and pause.
Do you not understand the irony of,

1674
01:06:42,161 --> 01:06:42,994
we're talking about people labeling 
themselves as victims and you are 

1675
01:06:45,701 --> 01:06:49,150
labeling yourself as victim of a crime 
that has not occurred.

1676
01:06:49,270 --> 01:06:50,103
No.
I'm talking about articles that are 

1677
01:06:50,831 --> 01:06:53,800
being written by journalists and videos 
that are being made,

1678
01:06:53,801 --> 01:06:56,500
but they have not been made yet.
And then you're saying just watch.

1679
01:06:56,530 --> 01:06:58,090
They're going to be made.
Yeah,

1680
01:06:58,100 --> 01:06:59,230
but unless,
cause I've been doing this red.

1681
01:06:59,620 --> 01:07:01,090
Okay.
Do you not see it?

1682
01:07:01,110 --> 01:07:01,943
Come on.
You gotta be able to see that a little 

1683
01:07:02,821 --> 01:07:06,160
bit.
I mean like I'm not like a victim.

1684
01:07:06,250 --> 01:07:09,090
This is something that happened to me.
But do you get that you,

1685
01:07:09,140 --> 01:07:13,180
we're just talking about right here.
Who is saying that you were stormed,

1686
01:07:13,270 --> 01:07:16,480
that you stormed the stage and you tell 
me journalists and I say,

1687
01:07:16,481 --> 01:07:17,800
where are these articles?
And you say,

1688
01:07:17,801 --> 01:07:19,510
just wait and watch the moment.

1689
01:07:19,510 --> 01:07:21,490
At the moment we're talking about like 
rumors,

1690
01:07:21,640 --> 01:07:22,331
you know,
for example,

1691
01:07:22,331 --> 01:07:24,430
like a it tim pool said that a friend of
his,

1692
01:07:24,431 --> 01:07:25,920
I think she's an actress,
but you know it's,

1693
01:07:25,921 --> 01:07:27,070
it's the same sort of,
okay,

1694
01:07:27,071 --> 01:07:30,190
but that's a la circles.
That's someone gossiping.

1695
01:07:30,360 --> 01:07:32,740
Right?
That doesn't mean that someone actually,

1696
01:07:32,741 --> 01:07:35,810
a journalist wrote an article about the 
half storming the staff.

1697
01:07:36,370 --> 01:07:37,203
How do you,
why do you think they would social 

1698
01:07:38,501 --> 01:07:39,334
media?
Why would you even concentrate on that 

1699
01:07:41,591 --> 01:07:43,000
if it has not occurred?
I mean,

1700
01:07:43,001 --> 01:07:43,834
isn't this sort of like a little black 
guy complaining about the man holding 

1701
01:07:46,061 --> 01:07:48,100
you back when there is no man holding 
you back?

1702
01:07:48,370 --> 01:07:50,920
I don't think it's analogous.
I mean it is.

1703
01:07:50,921 --> 01:07:53,920
You're talking about being a victim of a
crime that hasn't occurred.

1704
01:07:54,160 --> 01:07:56,460
No,
but I knew what these people are like up

1705
01:07:56,461 --> 01:07:57,670
in dealing with them for long enough.

1706
01:07:57,670 --> 01:07:59,590
Now I know what those white people are 
like,

1707
01:07:59,591 --> 01:08:00,424
man,
I've been dealing with them my whole 

1708
01:08:00,911 --> 01:08:01,361
life.
Yeah.

1709
01:08:01,361 --> 01:08:03,400
But when we actually have a precedent 
for them doing this as well.

1710
01:08:03,550 --> 01:08:04,810
Right.
But they're not doing it right now.

1711
01:08:04,811 --> 01:08:05,644
And you're saying they are,
they are their own social media right 

1712
01:08:07,151 --> 01:08:09,280
now.
I mean like you go like generalists like

1713
01:08:09,310 --> 01:08:10,660
Ian Miles Chung who said,
right.

1714
01:08:10,661 --> 01:08:11,494
So the prevailing narrative among 
journalists at the moment is that song 

1715
01:08:13,841 --> 01:08:16,220
gone stone stage and abused.
The knees suck.

1716
01:08:16,221 --> 01:08:17,850
He's in one video.
Evidence says the exact,

1717
01:08:17,880 --> 01:08:19,730
this is something that she posted 
online.

1718
01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:20,593
Yeah,
he posted,

1719
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:22,340
there's no articles,
but there is a twitter,

1720
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:23,713
you can tell that it's coming up there 
at gun towers and then it was brewing 

1721
01:08:26,991 --> 01:08:28,640
and this,
and this is how these rumors start.

1722
01:08:28,670 --> 01:08:29,503
And then someone starts reporting it and
then suddenly you get a narrative going 

1723
01:08:32,331 --> 01:08:32,540
on.

1724
01:08:32,540 --> 01:08:33,373
I mean,
and I'm a victim of this because I've 

1725
01:08:33,951 --> 01:08:36,180
got a large enough reach to be able to 
say let's switch the video.

1726
01:08:36,310 --> 01:08:37,143
Cause I think people listening to this 
who have no idea who the fuck I need to 

1727
01:08:39,171 --> 01:08:41,390
start teasing is and don't even know who
you are.

1728
01:08:41,391 --> 01:08:43,250
They like there's a lot of people 
listening to this.

1729
01:08:43,251 --> 01:08:46,070
I would like to get to more interesting 
things.

1730
01:08:46,100 --> 01:08:47,040
Hmm.
Okay.

1731
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:49,870
Cause I say you're an interesting guy.
I said look your,

1732
01:08:49,871 --> 01:08:51,650
you were a little wrapped up in this 
right now,

1733
01:08:51,651 --> 01:08:53,450
which is okay,
I'm at the center.

1734
01:08:55,010 --> 01:08:55,843
I'll tell you what it was.
But you're a very smart guy and your 

1735
01:08:57,561 --> 01:08:59,270
videos are excellent.
You know,

1736
01:08:59,271 --> 01:09:00,850
and you're a punk house of grain.
Thanks.

1737
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,560
I'm,
I can't wait to Russ.

1738
01:09:04,360 --> 01:09:05,330
Who's Russ?
Your friend.

1739
01:09:05,331 --> 01:09:08,230
Yeah,
he's a huge fan of goes rusty's fanny.

1740
01:09:09,110 --> 01:09:13,640
I kind of wait to see you do like now 
that you have this gigantic audience,

1741
01:09:13,641 --> 01:09:15,420
do you feel certain amount of 
responsibility,

1742
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:18,770
but it was half intellectual integrity 
is the most important thing.

1743
01:09:19,010 --> 01:09:19,843
And the great thing about this and the 
great thing about the way the Internet 

1744
01:09:21,381 --> 01:09:22,610
works is that,
I mean,

1745
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:23,473
look at the,
look at the people who are at the top 

1746
01:09:24,351 --> 01:09:28,730
look like something like Cutie Pie,
man of outstanding moral character.

1747
01:09:29,050 --> 01:09:30,440
He who know him.
Do you hang with them?

1748
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:31,333
I've spoken to him a few times,
but I don't need to hang with them 

1749
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:34,100
tonight.
Look at what he does.

1750
01:09:34,310 --> 01:09:36,560
He doesn't go around bullying people.
Doesn't go around lying about people,

1751
01:09:36,700 --> 01:09:37,430
right?
Doesn't he does,

1752
01:09:37,430 --> 01:09:39,020
you guys aren't doing charity and being 
like,

1753
01:09:39,021 --> 01:09:39,950
Hey Bros,
you know,

1754
01:09:40,130 --> 01:09:41,900
and being nice to people and being 
inspiration.

1755
01:09:41,930 --> 01:09:43,240
What happened with him?
Can you,

1756
01:09:43,250 --> 01:09:44,360
would you know that?
Okay,

1757
01:09:44,361 --> 01:09:44,970
well let's,
let's,

1758
01:09:44,970 --> 01:09:47,300
let's go over the actual,
this is,

1759
01:09:47,660 --> 01:09:49,430
by the way,
this is affected me.

1760
01:09:49,650 --> 01:09:54,650
It affected a lot of youtube people 
where their youtube videos used to have,

1761
01:09:56,930 --> 01:09:59,720
um,
much freer monetization.

1762
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:04,960
Meaning that for people listening,
say if Sargon puts out a youtube video,

1763
01:10:05,300 --> 01:10:06,133
you could have ads on that youtube video
and your youtube videos get a lot of 

1764
01:10:10,071 --> 01:10:10,850
downloads.
Man.

1765
01:10:10,850 --> 01:10:12,530
I mean,
it would be very lucrative for you.

1766
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:13,873
And then with us,
our youtube money was cut by more than 

1767
01:10:18,771 --> 01:10:23,771
60% I think to retain 40% of your income
was pretty good as well.

1768
01:10:24,860 --> 01:10:28,850
Yeah.
Well the anything controversial,

1769
01:10:29,060 --> 01:10:29,893
anything having to do with anything 
right wing is deemed not not friendly 

1770
01:10:35,031 --> 01:10:35,864
for advertising.
Anything that has drugs in the title is 

1771
01:10:39,471 --> 01:10:40,304
deemed not friendly for advertising.
It's like we've literally been able to 

1772
01:10:43,191 --> 01:10:44,024
change the title of things and re upload
them and then they ads they that balls 

1773
01:10:48,830 --> 01:10:49,663
just so the same content.
So what all this came from is pooty pie 

1774
01:10:54,741 --> 01:10:57,800
who has an enormous youtube presence,
right?

1775
01:10:57,801 --> 01:10:59,710
Doesn't he have like 50 million 
followers?

1776
01:10:59,711 --> 01:11:00,200
Right.

1777
01:11:00,200 --> 01:11:04,830
Holy Shit.
And he made some videos that the,

1778
01:11:04,910 --> 01:11:06,650
what is it,
the Washington Post?

1779
01:11:06,830 --> 01:11:08,330
Cause I would,
it wasn't Wall Street Journal.

1780
01:11:08,690 --> 01:11:10,370
Wall Street Journal.
Can I tell you about it?

1781
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:11,540
Please do.
Please do.

1782
01:11:11,541 --> 01:11:13,390
Because you,
I'm sure much did.

1783
01:11:13,770 --> 01:11:16,950
I did a bunch of videos on this and it 
was the funniest thing in the world.

1784
01:11:17,250 --> 01:11:19,350
I love the language they use as well.
What's a scoop?

1785
01:11:19,980 --> 01:11:23,640
A scoop is a news story that other 
people are not aware of yet.

1786
01:11:23,670 --> 01:11:25,380
And can you sign it?
You got it first.

1787
01:11:25,381 --> 01:11:26,130
So if,
uh,

1788
01:11:26,130 --> 01:11:26,963
if tens of millions of people have seen 
something and then if I'm a Wall Street 

1789
01:11:31,351 --> 01:11:32,184
journalist and I come along and I find 
something with tens of millions of 

1790
01:11:34,231 --> 01:11:37,290
people have seen,
can I rightly call that a scoop?

1791
01:11:37,770 --> 01:11:38,603
Well,
you can definitely call it a news story 

1792
01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:43,320
and you could definitely say that people
in see that.

1793
01:11:43,350 --> 01:11:45,450
This goes back to what we were talking 
about before,

1794
01:11:45,451 --> 01:11:49,920
whereas they have a hierarchy of 
viewership.

1795
01:11:49,950 --> 01:11:50,783
Like what?
What is,

1796
01:11:50,820 --> 01:11:52,860
what is a,
a real network?

1797
01:11:52,861 --> 01:11:53,694
What does a real newspaper,
what is real journalism like in their 

1798
01:11:56,221 --> 01:11:57,054
mind,
I'm sure the Wall Street Journal 

1799
01:11:58,831 --> 01:12:03,220
considers themselves to be in the 
hierarchy versus someone who has helped,

1800
01:12:03,300 --> 01:12:05,880
but they don't have 55 million 
downloads.

1801
01:12:06,270 --> 01:12:07,260
They don't,
I mean,

1802
01:12:07,261 --> 01:12:08,094
there's no way if the w if no,
it's a street journal puts out a video 

1803
01:12:10,661 --> 01:12:11,640
of a million.
Yeah.

1804
01:12:11,641 --> 01:12:13,560
If they put out a video,
if they got a vit,

1805
01:12:13,580 --> 01:12:15,900
a million hits on their video,
that would be a big deal.

1806
01:12:15,930 --> 01:12:16,740
Yeah,
that'd be thrilled.

1807
01:12:16,740 --> 01:12:18,660
If pewdie pie,
how only a million hits,

1808
01:12:18,661 --> 01:12:21,120
I'm one,
it'd be super depressed.

1809
01:12:21,330 --> 01:12:25,140
He is a much bigger entity than them,
but in their mind,

1810
01:12:25,230 --> 01:12:29,880
like a scoop is them the legitimate 
media.

1811
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:33,030
So pointing out something in the 
illegitimate,

1812
01:12:33,300 --> 01:12:36,460
this new weird,
the city logos,

1813
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:38,520
fear.
So basically pd pie,

1814
01:12:38,521 --> 01:12:41,830
he's a comedian and he makes jokes,
but he's uh,

1815
01:12:41,980 --> 01:12:42,813
like I said,
he's a man of good character and he's 

1816
01:12:44,020 --> 01:12:44,853
parents should be thanking Pewdie Pie 
for being the person he is because he's 

1817
01:12:47,311 --> 01:12:48,144
talking to their kids and their kids are
gonna grow up being decent people 

1818
01:12:50,341 --> 01:12:51,360
because of his influence.

1819
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:53,790
But the Wall Street Journal,
Ben Fritz and Rolfe Winkler clan,

1820
01:12:53,791 --> 01:12:55,350
there was another one,
I can't remember his name at the moment.

1821
01:12:55,710 --> 01:12:57,240
They decided what they were going to do 
is,

1822
01:12:57,241 --> 01:12:59,040
and I don't know who put them up to this
obviously,

1823
01:12:59,340 --> 01:13:00,173
but uh,
they were going to watch about six 

1824
01:13:00,721 --> 01:13:01,554
months of his video,
go through and find any antisemitic 

1825
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:06,330
jokes that he had made.
Well,

1826
01:13:06,331 --> 01:13:09,810
I mean by definition is a joke.
So there's not six months.

1827
01:13:09,830 --> 01:13:10,291
Yeah,
six,

1828
01:13:10,291 --> 01:13:11,124
eight.
They sat together a video every day and 

1829
01:13:12,510 --> 01:13:13,343
they got about and like two minutes of 
footage or something with him making 

1830
01:13:16,201 --> 01:13:19,410
jokes at the expense of the Nazis 
effectively and they were like,

1831
01:13:19,411 --> 01:13:21,810
wow,
this guy's promoting antisemitism to see

1832
01:13:21,811 --> 01:13:24,060
those jokes.
Cause I've heard about them.

1833
01:13:24,110 --> 01:13:27,420
I don't know the actual jokes that he 
said that they were saying,

1834
01:13:27,570 --> 01:13:27,931
but,
but,

1835
01:13:27,931 --> 01:13:29,220
but here's the point.
Let's get to it.

1836
01:13:29,400 --> 01:13:30,233
They were saying that he is making light
of being a Nazi or pretending to be a 

1837
01:13:34,981 --> 01:13:35,814
Nazi and that this is what's fucked up.
Like he was promoting antisemitism by 

1838
01:13:39,620 --> 01:13:40,453
parodying.
The Nazis tried to explain to people is 

1839
01:13:43,321 --> 01:13:46,950
that it's Hogan's heroes work.
There isn't a mel brooks a bit.

1840
01:13:47,220 --> 01:13:49,290
Yeah,
bit of an old antique Jesus Christ.

1841
01:13:49,291 --> 01:13:51,930
He must be,
oh God.

1842
01:13:51,931 --> 01:13:53,050
Just so you know.
Yeah.

1843
01:13:53,090 --> 01:13:57,700
I mean springtime for Hitler you could 
say was somehow or another humanizing.

1844
01:13:57,701 --> 01:13:58,534
I imagine it created a lot of Nazis can 
imagine if somebody made the argument 

1845
01:14:03,931 --> 01:14:07,070
that Mel Gibson created Nazis.
That's how far we've come.

1846
01:14:07,080 --> 01:14:08,400
Mel Brooks,
Mel Brooks,

1847
01:14:08,401 --> 01:14:09,270
what'd I say?
Mel Gibson.

1848
01:14:09,271 --> 01:14:10,840
Yeah,
he my website today.

1849
01:14:12,820 --> 01:14:13,653
That was clearly a fraud.
He had only ever think about when 

1850
01:14:15,401 --> 01:14:16,234
someone says Mel Gibson drunk.
I think of him yelling about Jews and 

1851
01:14:18,611 --> 01:14:21,670
cops.
That's all I a big bid.

1852
01:14:21,671 --> 01:14:23,960
And everything's crazy.
Fucking Jews.

1853
01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:26,190
Jesus smells the smell

1854
01:14:29,780 --> 01:14:30,613
poster boy,
right?

1855
01:14:30,790 --> 01:14:31,960
Yeah.
Well he is.

1856
01:14:31,961 --> 01:14:34,690
Well,
he's a serious like nine 11 conspiracies

1857
01:14:34,691 --> 01:14:37,030
the lever and yeah,
where's that Charlie Sheen,

1858
01:14:37,390 --> 01:14:40,390
I'll probably lumping them together,
but he got my pain.

1859
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:41,081
The,
these,

1860
01:14:41,081 --> 01:14:41,950
these videos.
I'm,

1861
01:14:41,951 --> 01:14:44,560
one of them was the funniest thing 
because they were taking,

1862
01:14:44,680 --> 01:14:45,513
and the,
you know,

1863
01:14:45,710 --> 01:14:46,690
the jokes were like,
you know,

1864
01:14:46,691 --> 01:14:50,020
like I'm there like 20 seconds of joke 
taken out like a 10 minute video,

1865
01:14:50,350 --> 01:14:51,041
you know,
where he's just,

1866
01:14:51,041 --> 01:14:54,960
it's just like a cutaway skipped,
uh,

1867
01:14:54,970 --> 01:14:55,920
you know,
Wah Wah Wah.

1868
01:14:56,080 --> 01:14:56,913
I'm like,
you know,

1869
01:14:57,110 --> 01:14:57,943
one of them was a joke about how the 
media takes his jokes out of context to 

1870
01:15:03,731 --> 01:15:04,564
try and frame him as something new.
And they cut that out of context and 

1871
01:15:08,261 --> 01:15:09,790
used it and it was just like,
well,

1872
01:15:09,791 --> 01:15:11,200
there it is.
Which is amazing.

1873
01:15:11,230 --> 01:15:12,063
It's incredible.
It's amazing that they had the balls to 

1874
01:15:14,141 --> 01:15:14,974
do it and they would,
they would not only proud of what they 

1875
01:15:15,971 --> 01:15:16,540
did.

1876
01:15:16,540 --> 01:15:20,140
They called it a scoop and then they 
went to advertisers and said,

1877
01:15:20,141 --> 01:15:20,974
look at this hate speech,
but how do they get away with doing 

1878
01:15:23,891 --> 01:15:25,420
that?
How did they go and collect them too?

1879
01:15:25,421 --> 01:15:28,930
How come no one from the Wall Street 
Journal sat them down and said,

1880
01:15:28,931 --> 01:15:29,764
well listen,
this is definitely not him saying that 

1881
01:15:32,891 --> 01:15:35,380
you're going to take something out of 
context and then doing it.

1882
01:15:35,381 --> 01:15:36,214
Is it because of it is and then you took
it out of context and did exactly what 

1883
01:15:38,831 --> 01:15:42,100
he's saying you shouldn't do.
That's kind of crazy.

1884
01:15:42,250 --> 01:15:43,960
It's mental.
It is mental.

1885
01:15:44,030 --> 01:15:44,863
It's absolutely,
but they feel like they can get away 

1886
01:15:46,391 --> 01:15:47,224
with it because they're in the hallowed 
halls of actual media and they're 

1887
01:15:49,601 --> 01:15:51,370
putting this stuff out there.
Jvc,

1888
01:15:51,400 --> 01:15:53,990
do you define it?
See what,

1889
01:15:54,020 --> 01:15:54,853
see what you can be the terms of the 
financial jokes that pooty pie said 

1890
01:15:57,670 --> 01:15:58,503
there were supposedly the,
the funny thing though is that if you 

1891
01:16:00,731 --> 01:16:02,350
look at their numbers,
they look like that.

1892
01:16:02,590 --> 01:16:04,630
The Wall Street Journal.
If you look at his numbers,

1893
01:16:04,631 --> 01:16:06,160
they look like that.
And what's so strange,

1894
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:09,850
he's making hand gestures down for the 
Wall Street Journal up for Pooty Pie.

1895
01:16:10,330 --> 01:16:11,163
And what,
what's so strange about it though is 

1896
01:16:12,341 --> 01:16:14,590
that Peter Pie isn't that competition,
you know?

1897
01:16:14,810 --> 01:16:15,730
All right,
here we go.

1898
01:16:16,090 --> 01:16:18,040
Here we go.
Let's let some of them.

1899
01:16:18,041 --> 01:16:20,020
Great.
Let's see what we got here.

1900
01:16:20,050 --> 01:16:22,480
My name is Pia.
Whoa.

1901
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:24,810
Okay.
So Dan,

1902
01:16:24,850 --> 01:16:25,720
27 year old

1903
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:31,750
playing video games on Youtube.
Typical nuts.

1904
01:16:33,850 --> 01:16:37,700
Okay.
53 million subscriber.

1905
01:16:37,701 --> 01:16:41,740
You still 55 now Jesus.
The biggest star in the site by far.

1906
01:16:41,790 --> 01:16:43,540
If you go inside the stories,

1907
01:16:45,160 --> 01:16:45,993
scoop is better.

1908
01:16:47,730 --> 01:16:52,730
Let's get into the latest scoops.
So it's him.

1909
01:16:54,420 --> 01:16:56,400
This is the,
I think this is the one recently.

1910
01:16:56,401 --> 01:16:58,920
Some of his videos are brief,
including Nazi messages,

1911
01:16:58,921 --> 01:17:02,520
images of Edof Hitler,
and explicit antisemitic commentary.

1912
01:17:03,560 --> 01:17:05,450
So this is the Washington Post's 
version.

1913
01:17:05,600 --> 01:17:07,580
It will follow the Wall Street turned,
or rather sorry,

1914
01:17:07,760 --> 01:17:09,980
following a request for from the Wall 
Street Journal.

1915
01:17:09,981 --> 01:17:10,814
Disney said the videos are inappropriate
and cut ties to Pewdiepie who ran his 

1916
01:17:13,701 --> 01:17:14,534
business cost of millions of dollars of 
Disney subsidiary maker studios cost 

1917
01:17:18,801 --> 01:17:21,470
pooty pie,
millions in a January 11th video,

1918
01:17:21,471 --> 01:17:24,020
Mr Blah Blah Blah,
feature two men holding,

1919
01:17:24,021 --> 01:17:28,000
assigned reading death to all Jews after
hiring them from a freelance

1920
01:17:28,570 --> 01:17:31,150
website.
I liked the editing.

1921
01:17:33,960 --> 01:17:38,960
So the joke is his reaction to it and 
the fact that you could subscribe to Kim

1922
01:17:39,030 --> 01:17:41,100
Star who's like another big youtube,
but he was mocking it.

1923
01:17:41,430 --> 01:17:44,670
I don't think they would actually do it.
I feel partially responsible,

1924
01:17:44,671 --> 01:17:49,671
but I didn't think they would.
It might just be my sense of crude,

1925
01:17:50,041 --> 01:17:50,874
sense of humor,
but I think there's something funny 

1926
01:17:52,441 --> 01:17:53,274
about that and I don't fire back in the 
media for miss characterizing him about 

1927
01:17:57,241 --> 01:17:57,840
it.
Again,

1928
01:17:57,840 --> 01:17:58,673
I think there's a difference between a 
joke and actual like fucking death to 

1929
01:18:02,821 --> 01:18:05,010
all Jews.
If I made a video saying,

1930
01:18:05,070 --> 01:18:06,150
hey guys,
uh,

1931
01:18:06,180 --> 01:18:09,240
Peter Piot here,
death to all Jews,

1932
01:18:09,420 --> 01:18:14,310
I want you to say after me,
death to all Jews.

1933
01:18:14,580 --> 01:18:15,900
And uh,
you know,

1934
01:18:15,930 --> 01:18:20,610
Hitler was right.
I really opened my eyes to why power.

1935
01:18:21,060 --> 01:18:24,000
And I think it's time that we did 
something about it.

1936
01:18:24,330 --> 01:18:25,163
That's essentially how they're reporting
this as if that's what I was saying or 

1937
01:18:27,841 --> 01:18:28,800
some shit like that.

1938
01:18:29,310 --> 01:18:32,310
It's amazing how popular it is with such
a shitty grasp of English.

1939
01:18:32,790 --> 01:18:33,623
He's Swedish apologists can camouflage 
messages that may still be received and 

1940
01:18:36,381 --> 01:18:40,140
celebrated by hate groups.
The southern poverty law center says,

1941
01:18:40,230 --> 01:18:41,970
yeah,
so if,

1942
01:18:42,240 --> 01:18:44,070
if the southern poverty law center 
condemns you,

1943
01:18:44,071 --> 01:18:45,720
it's becoming a bit of a badge of honor 
these days.

1944
01:18:45,750 --> 01:18:46,583
In the video since removed,
he posted a video of a man dressed as 

1945
01:18:49,200 --> 01:18:50,033
Jesus Christ.
I love how they have like since removed 

1946
01:18:51,901 --> 01:18:55,080
is bold and then Jesus Christ is both 
really nice guys.

1947
01:18:55,170 --> 01:18:56,240
The Jesus guy.
Yeah.

1948
01:18:56,490 --> 01:19:00,540
What the F I want it to act upon.
God's will.

1949
01:19:01,530 --> 01:19:05,250
Don't worry though.
He stands beside God now he isn't.

1950
01:19:06,600 --> 01:19:08,700
That's all folks Jesus out.

1951
01:19:09,440 --> 01:19:12,140
And I wasn't the one who made him say it
or was it?

1952
01:19:12,610 --> 01:19:13,250
No,
it wasn't.

1953
01:19:13,250 --> 01:19:14,083
I don't think so.
He set up a go fund me page and his own 

1954
01:19:17,151 --> 01:19:20,960
website so you can take orders from 
Jesus himself.

1955
01:19:21,650 --> 01:19:23,450
And also can I just point out

1956
01:19:24,820 --> 01:19:27,040
this is not what I'm looking for.
Where,

1957
01:19:27,050 --> 01:19:30,820
where are the actual videos of him doing
the the Nazi shit?

1958
01:19:31,570 --> 01:19:33,160
That was it.
That's 100% it.

1959
01:19:33,190 --> 01:19:34,023
That's it.
Is there an article that led to all of 

1960
01:19:35,801 --> 01:19:37,150
this?
Right,

1961
01:19:37,151 --> 01:19:37,984
but what we're looking at here,
this is the Wall Street Journal's 

1962
01:19:40,031 --> 01:19:40,940
version of it.
Yeah.

1963
01:19:41,100 --> 01:19:42,010
Yeah.
So this is,

1964
01:19:42,100 --> 01:19:42,933
these are the clips and they said this 
is the actual clips that they're saying 

1965
01:19:44,950 --> 01:19:47,050
are the thing that shows him to be 
antisemitic.

1966
01:19:48,160 --> 01:19:52,420
Holy Shit.
The W I thought it was way better than,

1967
01:19:52,421 --> 01:19:55,060
I thought it was just a little theo.
He got made off fiverr.

1968
01:19:55,210 --> 01:19:56,043
Yeah.
It's just him prancing around on the 

1969
01:19:57,491 --> 01:19:58,061
Internet.
It's just,

1970
01:19:58,061 --> 01:20:00,610
it's just silly childish jokes and it's 
all who see?

1971
01:20:00,611 --> 01:20:02,350
I mean how many Nazis do you think this 
made?

1972
01:20:02,740 --> 01:20:03,910
Three.
Really?

1973
01:20:04,300 --> 01:20:06,460
That's how I got,
I think three is too high.

1974
01:20:07,180 --> 01:20:08,740
Just stupid.
It's like you don't,

1975
01:20:08,790 --> 01:20:10,440
it doesn't take a lot to like turn them.

1976
01:20:12,060 --> 01:20:15,450
There was the really bad thing about 
this though is the fact that they didn't

1977
01:20:15,451 --> 01:20:16,284
put this article out until they had like
taken these clips and dobbed him in to 

1978
01:20:20,051 --> 01:20:23,130
Disney and Disney.
Disney obviously new shit.

1979
01:20:23,131 --> 01:20:24,840
There's going to be a shit storm about 
this.

1980
01:20:25,170 --> 01:20:28,440
So they tried to do this political 
attack,

1981
01:20:28,500 --> 01:20:30,630
but why?
What is it making money?

1982
01:20:30,900 --> 01:20:33,660
Losing money is politics or not that 
politics as well.

1983
01:20:33,870 --> 01:20:34,703
Yeah.
He mocks like,

1984
01:20:34,890 --> 01:20:36,010
you know,
he mocks feminism,

1985
01:20:36,011 --> 01:20:37,650
you know smocks social justice.
He's not,

1986
01:20:37,890 --> 01:20:38,910
he's not,
he's a liberal.

1987
01:20:38,911 --> 01:20:41,010
He's not a progressive.
That's the difference.

1988
01:20:41,130 --> 01:20:43,350
Why would they think that they could 
just do that though?

1989
01:20:43,380 --> 01:20:44,580
Because they've got the power to do 
that.

1990
01:20:44,640 --> 01:20:45,950
No one can stop it and you couldn't see 
that.

1991
01:20:45,960 --> 01:20:47,550
They did.
They cost him millions of dollars.

1992
01:20:47,580 --> 01:20:48,413
I'm sure they did,
but it's now costing them their 

1993
01:20:50,941 --> 01:20:52,260
reputation.
I'm [inaudible].

1994
01:20:52,530 --> 01:20:54,540
Yeah,
I mean you can't just do that.

1995
01:20:54,570 --> 01:20:56,670
Like Eric Street journals.
They,

1996
01:20:56,790 --> 01:21:00,150
they took a big hit from this.
I'm sure that unbelievably arrogant.

1997
01:21:00,180 --> 01:21:01,650
Well actually do you know it was really 
interesting,

1998
01:21:01,651 --> 01:21:03,830
right?
There was a off after all of this shit,

1999
01:21:03,831 --> 01:21:04,664
so blue over there was a bunch of polls 
done of like 13 to 18 year olds and it 

2000
01:21:08,101 --> 01:21:12,090
was really fascinating how you had like 
favorability and what,

2001
01:21:12,091 --> 01:21:15,330
how well known things where and like 
youtube was really well known,

2002
01:21:15,331 --> 01:21:16,164
really favorable with kids,
you know and then you had the Wall 

2003
01:21:18,600 --> 01:21:22,170
Street Journal which was really well 
known but really unfavorable with kids.

2004
01:21:22,680 --> 01:21:23,513
How do the,
how the kids know what the Wall Street 

2005
01:21:24,241 --> 01:21:25,074
journalist because of Cutie Pie.
So now their strings with the Wall 

2006
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:29,153
Street Journal in this way,
the millions of people that are his 

2007
01:21:30,031 --> 01:21:31,080
fans.
Exactly.

2008
01:21:31,140 --> 01:21:34,590
Well that's a big mistake to a guy with 
a platform like that.

2009
01:21:34,620 --> 01:21:36,980
It's of this time when their voters and 
their,

2010
01:21:36,990 --> 01:21:39,930
their reading you consuming news,
the Wall Street Journal will continue to

2011
01:21:39,931 --> 01:21:40,430
be there.

2012
01:21:40,430 --> 01:21:43,320
They'll continue to go down.
Beauty pounds still be doing well.

2013
01:21:43,410 --> 01:21:44,243
But what's the,
what's crazy is I never thought of the 

2014
01:21:46,350 --> 01:21:47,183
Wall Street Journal is that what I 
thought of the Wall Street Journal as 

2015
01:21:48,361 --> 01:21:52,530
being like informative,
objective information about my business.

2016
01:21:53,040 --> 01:21:55,680
When if you asked me like what is the 
Wall Street Journal?

2017
01:21:55,681 --> 01:21:58,660
That's how I've always thought of them.
So to see the,

2018
01:21:58,661 --> 01:22:00,960
see this video pretty shocking,
isn't it?

2019
01:22:01,200 --> 01:22:03,300
Well it is disturbing because there's 
nothing there.

2020
01:22:03,470 --> 01:22:05,760
No.
They make the death to all Jews thing.

2021
01:22:05,761 --> 01:22:06,594
The fact that city did he pay those guys
to hold up that sign I $5 to write on 

2022
01:22:10,931 --> 01:22:14,020
the side so he could go,
oh cause you know it kisses taboo.

2023
01:22:14,340 --> 01:22:15,500
Right?
He's just breaking it to be.

2024
01:22:15,501 --> 01:22:17,130
Exactly,
exactly.

2025
01:22:17,310 --> 01:22:19,200
If nobody had said anything,
nothing would come.

2026
01:22:19,201 --> 01:22:21,390
It's in poor taste and if you're 
representing Disney,

2027
01:22:21,391 --> 01:22:23,480
you can't fuck with that stuff.
That's all that is.

2028
01:22:23,800 --> 01:22:24,950
That he's like,
he's been,

2029
01:22:25,050 --> 01:22:26,190
I understand,
but it's not,

2030
01:22:26,191 --> 01:22:28,750
my point is I'm defending I'm,
it's not evidence of antisemitism.

2031
01:22:28,751 --> 01:22:29,071
No.
Yeah,

2032
01:22:29,071 --> 01:22:29,904
no,
he's just saying something fucked up 

2033
01:22:30,661 --> 01:22:32,550
because that's,
he's trying to be shocking.

2034
01:22:32,640 --> 01:22:33,473
Yeah.
He's just think that Hitler stuff like 

2035
01:22:34,741 --> 01:22:35,574
Holy Shit,
there was nothing there and that's so 

2036
01:22:37,260 --> 01:22:38,093
stupid.
It's just the stupidest thing in the 

2037
01:22:38,971 --> 01:22:39,541
world.
And it's,

2038
01:22:39,541 --> 01:22:41,880
I mean this is the thing where I look at
the Keck stony flag.

2039
01:22:41,881 --> 01:22:45,450
What I love about this is it's a parody 
of the Nazi flag,

2040
01:22:45,630 --> 01:22:46,800
right.
Of a swastika.

2041
01:22:46,830 --> 01:22:48,540
What is it in there?
It's in there.

2042
01:22:49,170 --> 01:22:51,390
It's silly internet stuff.
But is it a k in there?

2043
01:22:51,460 --> 01:22:51,990
Yeah.
Yeah,

2044
01:22:51,990 --> 01:22:52,960
but it's,
it's,

2045
01:22:53,250 --> 01:22:54,750
yeah,
it's okay.

2046
01:22:54,920 --> 01:22:55,753
I can't say when you,
when you have to explain any of this to 

2047
01:22:57,841 --> 01:22:58,674
someone.
It sounds like a stupid thing in works 

2048
01:22:59,540 --> 01:23:00,373
is Internet humor.
I love planting that you would dream 

2049
01:23:01,850 --> 01:23:02,250
fly.

2050
01:23:02,250 --> 01:23:03,180
I know.
Isn't that great?

2051
01:23:03,570 --> 01:23:05,440
Isn't that great?
I'm,

2052
01:23:06,350 --> 01:23:07,830
but that's what it's supposed to be 
exact.

2053
01:23:07,831 --> 01:23:08,730
Right,
exactly.

2054
01:23:08,731 --> 01:23:10,390
Cause that's how they come across to 
everyone else.

2055
01:23:10,391 --> 01:23:11,170
It's like guys,
you,

2056
01:23:11,170 --> 01:23:13,420
this is how stupid you look to us.
Yeah.

2057
01:23:13,460 --> 01:23:14,293
To the North End.
And then we'll just see that thing that 

2058
01:23:15,281 --> 01:23:17,230
somebody put up about,
uh,

2059
01:23:17,290 --> 01:23:19,860
it's a you and,
um,

2060
01:23:19,870 --> 01:23:23,740
Milo and a bunch of other people and 
you've got a red pill and it says,

2061
01:23:24,220 --> 01:23:25,053
get in the car.
Normies we're going to save 

2062
01:23:26,531 --> 01:23:30,520
civilization.
Someone's gotta do it like Watts.

2063
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,040
First of all,
who the fuck thinks that?

2064
01:23:33,041 --> 01:23:35,620
That's really,
if anyone takes that seriously,

2065
01:23:35,621 --> 01:23:36,940
they're a fucking idiot.
Yeah.

2066
01:23:37,690 --> 01:23:38,600
That's basic.
But that's the,

2067
01:23:38,601 --> 01:23:39,341
that's the point,
isn't it?

2068
01:23:39,341 --> 01:23:41,380
It's about people who can't laugh at 
themselves.

2069
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:44,250
If you can't laugh at yourself,
then we must appointment.

2070
01:23:44,251 --> 01:23:46,360
But there's also so many layers to this 
thing.

2071
01:23:46,380 --> 01:23:48,280
You have to be paying attention to it 
all the time.

2072
01:23:48,281 --> 01:23:49,114
Like you to be able to keep up.
Like even I have to ask you questions 

2073
01:23:51,461 --> 01:23:51,791
like,
wait,

2074
01:23:51,791 --> 01:23:53,650
what's that?
What's going on here?

2075
01:23:54,070 --> 01:23:55,390
Cause I'm not paying attention.
It's a,

2076
01:23:55,391 --> 01:23:58,240
it's a complex subject.
But I think the idea of this,

2077
01:23:58,270 --> 01:23:59,103
the thing like the southern poverty law 
center of course came out and condemned 

2078
01:24:01,211 --> 01:24:02,044
Keck,
Stan,

2079
01:24:02,300 --> 01:24:04,260
uh,
because they're fucking idea.

2080
01:24:04,261 --> 01:24:05,860
But it's not real.
I exactly,

2081
01:24:05,920 --> 01:24:07,480
I just check a stance supposed to.
Is that,

2082
01:24:07,510 --> 01:24:09,340
is that supposed to be all right though,
is no,

2083
01:24:09,350 --> 01:24:09,671
no,
no,

2084
01:24:09,671 --> 01:24:11,230
of course it's not.
It's actually,

2085
01:24:11,530 --> 01:24:12,363
it's an identity for people who don't 
want an identity because I'm not an 

2086
01:24:15,191 --> 01:24:17,270
identitarian.
I didn't say it's very non binary.

2087
01:24:17,320 --> 01:24:19,210
Sounds like Latinex kind of.
Yeah.

2088
01:24:19,300 --> 01:24:19,960
Well,
that's none of,

2089
01:24:19,960 --> 01:24:20,793
that's,
that's,

2090
01:24:21,170 --> 01:24:25,180
that's exactly what it's supposed to 
sound like when they say I'm a Latin X,

2091
01:24:25,181 --> 01:24:26,014
I'm,
I'm,

2092
01:24:26,200 --> 01:24:28,680
let me talk to you about my work,
blackness and stuff like that.

2093
01:24:28,690 --> 01:24:31,650
A while to be a woke black person.
Well you can be a is donny was,

2094
01:24:31,660 --> 01:24:33,610
that's why this,
let me tell you about my work.

2095
01:24:33,611 --> 01:24:35,590
Blackness is one of the coolest things 
you could ever say,

2096
01:24:35,650 --> 01:24:36,790
but that's the,
that's what it is though.

2097
01:24:36,791 --> 01:24:38,150
Cause when someone comes to you about 
their identity,

2098
01:24:38,151 --> 01:24:38,984
is that okay?
But this isn't a conversation I want to 

2099
01:24:39,971 --> 01:24:40,804
have with you.
It's not politics as usual and it's 

2100
01:24:42,491 --> 01:24:43,324
like,
well I don't have an ethnicity or like 

2101
01:24:44,381 --> 01:24:45,000
a,
like a,

2102
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:46,180
uh,
an identity,

2103
01:24:46,360 --> 01:24:47,890
you know,
I don't play identity politics.

2104
01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:48,753
They played entity politics.
Keka Stan is a parody of identity 

2105
01:24:51,371 --> 01:24:53,730
politics and every identity politician 
hates it.

2106
01:24:54,160 --> 01:24:56,800
Everyone who,
everyone who gets into bed with identity

2107
01:24:56,810 --> 01:24:57,370
politics.
Yeah.

2108
01:24:57,370 --> 01:25:00,640
One of my blackness or Latina or white 
whiteness or my Jewishness,

2109
01:25:00,641 --> 01:25:01,990
whatever it is.
Okay,

2110
01:25:02,020 --> 01:25:04,840
what am I Keka stylishness you know,
and they're just like,

2111
01:25:04,841 --> 01:25:05,320
well,
shut up.

2112
01:25:05,320 --> 01:25:09,130
That's not real well done.
You finally got it right.

2113
01:25:09,190 --> 01:25:11,170
I don't give a shit about your fucking 
identity.

2114
01:25:11,260 --> 01:25:14,350
You don't give a shit about mine.
So let's talk about the issues,

2115
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:16,270
the issues.
Dot,

2116
01:25:16,271 --> 01:25:17,104
dot,
dot.

2117
01:25:17,650 --> 01:25:18,560
So,
um,

2118
01:25:19,010 --> 01:25:20,770
where is it?
How does he stand now?

2119
01:25:20,771 --> 01:25:22,750
Like,
so he lost this Disney deal.

2120
01:25:22,810 --> 01:25:23,643
Oh yeah.
The Wall Street Journal or the 

2121
01:25:24,740 --> 01:25:25,573
finalists.
But how many people were actually aware 

2122
01:25:28,331 --> 01:25:31,570
of the real content?
Like what are you actually did,

2123
01:25:31,680 --> 01:25:32,513
but I'm,
what I'm saying is how many people are 

2124
01:25:33,311 --> 01:25:36,460
aware of versus the magazine Article?
Oh,

2125
01:25:36,461 --> 01:25:37,294
it's a,
it's about the type of people who are 

2126
01:25:37,991 --> 01:25:39,370
aware.
Because I wasn't aware,

2127
01:25:39,371 --> 01:25:41,920
of course I knew who he was.
I'd heard his name.

2128
01:25:42,250 --> 01:25:43,083
And when I heard the story,
I had heard a bunch of different 

2129
01:25:45,731 --> 01:25:46,564
accounts.
I tried to sift between the two and the 

2130
01:25:48,641 --> 01:25:53,110
middle seem to be that he was doing like
typical internet stuff being silly,

2131
01:25:53,111 --> 01:25:55,100
but none of it was really antisemitic 
close.

2132
01:25:55,270 --> 01:25:57,910
But that's even milder than what I 
thought it was.

2133
01:25:58,240 --> 01:25:59,073
These that's insanely milder,
especially when you're using the clips 

2134
01:26:02,321 --> 01:26:05,480
of him saying if I was taken out of 
context.

2135
01:26:05,660 --> 01:26:06,170
Yeah,
it's,

2136
01:26:06,170 --> 01:26:07,550
it's,
it's absolutely pathetic.

2137
01:26:07,610 --> 01:26:09,770
Um,
but it's obviously the,

2138
01:26:09,771 --> 01:26:11,540
the audience of the Wall Street Journal 
is a,

2139
01:26:11,610 --> 01:26:14,720
the elites,
the intelligentsia smarts,

2140
01:26:14,730 --> 01:26:15,563
rich people,
people that don't have a good Internet 

2141
01:26:16,850 --> 01:26:18,080
connection.
Yeah,

2142
01:26:18,081 --> 01:26:18,914
exactly.
Well now that we've got the best 

2143
01:26:21,321 --> 01:26:22,154
internet connections,
but they're not going to live very long 

2144
01:26:23,510 --> 01:26:26,660
because they're old PD pause audience is
coming up.

2145
01:26:26,750 --> 01:26:29,300
They're going to be the ones who were 
essentially taking over the world.

2146
01:26:29,301 --> 01:26:30,134
And pewdie pie is the one who's showing 
them that look at the things these 

2147
01:26:32,601 --> 01:26:35,090
people are saying they're bad.
And you know,

2148
01:26:35,091 --> 01:26:36,770
because they're attacking me and you 
know me,

2149
01:26:37,040 --> 01:26:38,960
I'm not doing anything wrong.
So you know,

2150
01:26:38,961 --> 01:26:41,700
you can't trust these people.
They are going to come after you.

2151
01:26:41,700 --> 01:26:43,430
If,
if they can go off to Pewdie Pie,

2152
01:26:43,700 --> 01:26:47,180
the biggest youtuber in the world,
then they can go off to anyone.

2153
01:26:47,630 --> 01:26:52,340
But it's really dangerous to frame 
things that way because it's dishonest.

2154
01:26:52,580 --> 01:26:53,413
And as soon as you do something like 
that and you make a dishonest 

2155
01:26:55,851 --> 01:26:56,684
representation of this guy of pooty pie,
immediately every other thing that you 

2156
01:27:00,711 --> 01:27:01,760
print,
I'm going to go,

2157
01:27:01,761 --> 01:27:02,594
well suspect guys already made that 
thing about Pootie by and that was 

2158
01:27:04,821 --> 01:27:05,654
bullshit.
Like do you add it to a lot of work to 

2159
01:27:07,581 --> 01:27:11,330
make that like to to cherry pick that 
that hard.

2160
01:27:11,420 --> 01:27:12,253
Oh they went through six months of video
and got like two minutes of footage and 

2161
01:27:14,271 --> 01:27:16,190
it's hilarious.
And he does a video everyday.

2162
01:27:16,730 --> 01:27:17,563
So it's just like,
cause I mean you saw the quality of the 

2163
01:27:18,531 --> 01:27:19,520
visual craft,
it's just,

2164
01:27:19,630 --> 01:27:20,463
yeah.
Was funded that the Wall Street Journal 

2165
01:27:22,221 --> 01:27:24,680
funded that like that had to cost a lot 
of money.

2166
01:27:24,680 --> 01:27:26,710
Right.
Well similar,

2167
01:27:26,730 --> 01:27:29,450
you're paying these guys by the hour,
they're working on that to what,

2168
01:27:29,451 --> 01:27:30,284
what's your bunch of youtube videos 
maybe millions of people have already 

2169
01:27:31,941 --> 01:27:32,774
watched and then go,
we look at the scope we've got and try 

2170
01:27:34,221 --> 01:27:38,670
to find one or two Jewish jokes.
She,

2171
01:27:38,990 --> 01:27:39,823
if he was Jewish,
he could a mel brooks is way right to 

2172
01:27:41,541 --> 01:27:43,550
that motherfucker and been fine.
But,

2173
01:27:43,551 --> 01:27:44,384
uh,
unfortunately for pd pie he's got white 

2174
01:27:45,471 --> 01:27:47,000
male privilege so you can't do the 
thing.

2175
01:27:47,640 --> 01:27:48,473
Ah,
well you have to recognize your 

2176
01:27:49,941 --> 01:27:51,740
privilege.
Suture important.

2177
01:27:51,920 --> 01:27:53,900
Check your privilege at the door.
It's a,

2178
01:27:53,910 --> 01:27:54,743
it's a wonderful way for people to 
control your original sin to tell you 

2179
01:27:57,140 --> 01:27:59,630
yes it is a restaurant.
It really is.

2180
01:27:59,900 --> 01:28:00,733
These people are creating a new 
priesthood that if you look at the 

2181
01:28:02,721 --> 01:28:03,554
diversity officers,
I mean like in Britain and the BBC is 

2182
01:28:05,301 --> 01:28:06,134
the prime example they've started,
I mean they actually have job positions 

2183
01:28:08,901 --> 01:28:09,734
where they hire on the basis of race and
against people on the basis of race for 

2184
01:28:13,051 --> 01:28:13,280
example.

2185
01:28:13,280 --> 01:28:15,500
Not even for like if it was like in 
front of the camera,

2186
01:28:15,501 --> 01:28:16,334
I can understand,
you know,

2187
01:28:16,340 --> 01:28:18,530
I mean like,
I mean I don't like the,

2188
01:28:18,560 --> 01:28:20,330
we need more black people.
We need more brown people,

2189
01:28:20,331 --> 01:28:22,310
whatever.
But I mean I could at least go,

2190
01:28:22,311 --> 01:28:25,310
well I mean like you were saying that 
it's good to have examples.

2191
01:28:25,330 --> 01:28:25,850
I,
I can,

2192
01:28:25,850 --> 01:28:27,780
I can accept that I don't like it,
but not the,

2193
01:28:27,790 --> 01:28:28,623
not because I don't want see Brown 
people because it's discriminatory on 

2194
01:28:30,921 --> 01:28:31,754
the basis of race.
But I can at least accept it for a good 

2195
01:28:33,231 --> 01:28:36,200
conclusion.
But for this,

2196
01:28:36,260 --> 01:28:39,500
it's just a research position behind the
scenes.

2197
01:28:39,560 --> 01:28:40,970
18 grand a year,
you know,

2198
01:28:40,971 --> 01:28:41,804
making nothing,
but all you're doing is typing into 

2199
01:28:43,131 --> 01:28:44,420
google and finding things and they're 
like,

2200
01:28:44,421 --> 01:28:45,254
white people can't apply.
And I have to fund that with my TV 

2201
01:28:48,501 --> 01:28:51,170
license.
It's crazy that white people can apply.

2202
01:28:51,171 --> 01:28:52,004
I know.
No whites allowed so racist and they're 

2203
01:28:53,900 --> 01:28:55,940
wondering why the outrights are doing so
well.

2204
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:57,500
Why,
why so many people just like,

2205
01:28:57,501 --> 01:28:58,610
you know,
get fucked.

2206
01:28:58,640 --> 01:29:02,070
But the idea that you could say that 
like your melon content is

2207
01:29:02,070 --> 01:29:04,440
going to prohibit you from getting this 
job.

2208
01:29:05,100 --> 01:29:05,933
Did you,
I'm sure you paid attention to the 

2209
01:29:06,691 --> 01:29:09,450
evergreen state college fiasco,
Bret Weinstein.

2210
01:29:09,510 --> 01:29:11,390
Did you listen to Brett when he was on 
this podcast?

2211
01:29:11,400 --> 01:29:13,280
From that time I've been busy.
He analysts,

2212
01:29:13,680 --> 01:29:16,350
he's a very shockingly progressive map 
is,

2213
01:29:16,390 --> 01:29:17,223
and he's,
he's a super liberal and essentially 

2214
01:29:18,860 --> 01:29:22,740
really Nepalese can all you man,
he's a really nice guy and yeah,

2215
01:29:22,741 --> 01:29:25,380
he seemed to,
he seemed to and the poor guys in hiding

2216
01:29:25,381 --> 01:29:26,890
now.
Yeah,

2217
01:29:26,910 --> 01:29:27,900
he's in hiding.
He is,

2218
01:29:27,901 --> 01:29:31,200
he like literally he had to remove his 
family from,

2219
01:29:31,230 --> 01:29:33,240
from there and kind of put them in 
hiding.

2220
01:29:33,750 --> 01:29:36,950
He um,
does the schools essentially almost shut

2221
01:29:36,951 --> 01:29:37,531
down?
Yeah,

2222
01:29:37,531 --> 01:29:38,364
they took over.
I mean the thing is chaos and now 

2223
01:29:40,681 --> 01:29:41,514
they're voting to remove funding and 
turn into a private school because 

2224
01:29:45,840 --> 01:29:47,370
they're like,
you guys are out of your mind.

2225
01:29:47,371 --> 01:29:48,210
You can't,
we can't,

2226
01:29:48,240 --> 01:29:49,620
that's type of tax dollars.

2227
01:29:50,210 --> 01:29:51,043
But they told him that he should stay 
home because they wanted a day of 

2228
01:29:54,421 --> 01:29:56,940
absence where white people were not 
allowed to go to work.

2229
01:29:56,941 --> 01:29:58,590
And he was like,
what the fuck are you doing?

2230
01:29:58,650 --> 01:30:00,330
I'm Jewish.
That not only that,

2231
01:30:00,331 --> 01:30:02,270
it's like that's racist.
And they're like,

2232
01:30:02,280 --> 01:30:03,113
no,
your race without the woman at one of 

2233
01:30:05,551 --> 01:30:08,580
the women who was responsible for it 
called his wife are racist.

2234
01:30:08,581 --> 01:30:11,760
And without saying that white,
what he called,

2235
01:30:11,790 --> 01:30:12,623
she called for it on a facebook post.
She called for white women to take this 

2236
01:30:16,741 --> 01:30:18,990
racist white,
take her rice,

2237
01:30:19,020 --> 01:30:19,853
wait,
racist white ass out or something like 

2238
01:30:21,181 --> 01:30:23,250
that.
Then think about this old hall or out,

2239
01:30:23,290 --> 01:30:24,123
maybe calling out.
The thing about all of this really 

2240
01:30:25,771 --> 01:30:27,270
dangerous because at some point white 
people go,

2241
01:30:27,271 --> 01:30:28,104
yeah,
okay,

2242
01:30:28,110 --> 01:30:30,810
but she's calling her white.
She's calling her a racist white.

2243
01:30:31,270 --> 01:30:32,103
Damn.
It just because someone doesn't agree 

2244
01:30:33,181 --> 01:30:37,170
with you on something that's really 
racist doesn't mean they're racist.

2245
01:30:37,170 --> 01:30:38,003
Of course not.
But it's dangerous to do this because I 

2246
01:30:40,081 --> 01:30:40,914
mean,
if you're going to use this as a weapon 

2247
01:30:41,940 --> 01:30:43,170
against the [inaudible],
this is,

2248
01:30:43,171 --> 01:30:44,580
this is an attack.
Yeah.

2249
01:30:44,670 --> 01:30:46,680
He's refusing to cooperate.
So they're attacking him.

2250
01:30:46,770 --> 01:30:47,760
Well,
it's a control.

2251
01:30:47,790 --> 01:30:48,623
It's without a doubt.
It's about control because this is 100% 

2252
01:30:50,581 --> 01:30:52,790
about people trying to control other 
people's political,

2253
01:30:53,230 --> 01:30:54,063
political,
and this is a political attack and if 

2254
01:30:55,591 --> 01:30:56,424
you're going right,
you don't want to be a racist d at some 

2255
01:30:58,081 --> 01:31:00,360
point the white people just going to go,
I guess I'm racist.

2256
01:31:00,390 --> 01:31:01,223
Did you see where they had the president
and they were talking to him and the 

2257
01:31:03,781 --> 01:31:04,614
president was addressing these students.
They were being fucking completely 

2258
01:31:06,901 --> 01:31:07,734
ridiculous.
And they told him to put his hands down 

2259
01:31:09,870 --> 01:31:11,910
because his hands were a 
microaggression.

2260
01:31:12,030 --> 01:31:12,863
And then a kid stood up next to him in 
like a threatening manner and told him 

2261
01:31:16,251 --> 01:31:18,120
to put his hands down and he put his 
hands down.

2262
01:31:18,120 --> 01:31:20,100
They started laughing,
they started laughing.

2263
01:31:20,520 --> 01:31:23,460
It's clearly game.
They're playing ping pong.

2264
01:31:23,490 --> 01:31:25,950
They're playing checkers and just 
bullied him knowing him.

2265
01:31:26,010 --> 01:31:27,480
But this,
it's not just that,

2266
01:31:27,481 --> 01:31:30,690
it's not just bullying,
it's like them grouping up.

2267
01:31:30,720 --> 01:31:31,553
It's theresa toward each other and how 
he feels or he was saying that he 

2268
01:31:34,951 --> 01:31:38,520
believes it's like a mass psychosis that
literally,

2269
01:31:38,521 --> 01:31:39,354
it's like a mass hysteria.
It's like people losing their minds in 

2270
01:31:42,241 --> 01:31:43,090
this large,
losing the,

2271
01:31:43,100 --> 01:31:45,960
amongst all that being given undue power
that they don't deserve.

2272
01:31:46,280 --> 01:31:47,113
They have an end all of this pile,
but they're doing something with that 

2273
01:31:48,601 --> 01:31:49,920
power.
If they gave you that power,

2274
01:31:49,921 --> 01:31:53,010
you wouldn't.
So it is some sort of a psychosis.

2275
01:31:53,460 --> 01:31:54,630
Absolutely.
These people,

2276
01:31:54,650 --> 01:31:55,820
uh,
that they've never been,

2277
01:31:56,090 --> 01:31:58,470
they're not being held to an account.
Right then I'll be told,

2278
01:31:58,770 --> 01:31:59,220
look,
when you,

2279
01:31:59,220 --> 01:32:00,160
when you earn power,

2280
01:32:00,190 --> 01:32:02,350
you Germany happiness a karate kid,
isn't it?

2281
01:32:02,550 --> 01:32:03,390
You,
you home power.

2282
01:32:03,391 --> 01:32:04,690
You have to be responsible with that 
power.

2283
01:32:05,170 --> 01:32:08,650
And that's what a good leader is.
These people are just being given power.

2284
01:32:08,651 --> 01:32:11,110
They haven't earned it.
They've been given it and they are being

2285
01:32:11,111 --> 01:32:13,720
told they can't do anything wrong.
And so they think,

2286
01:32:13,721 --> 01:32:15,520
well fuck,
I'll do whatever the fuck I like them.

2287
01:32:15,550 --> 01:32:16,383
They're also told that like you can 
always step up and talk about your 

2288
01:32:19,841 --> 01:32:22,300
blackness or whatever and everyone has 
to kind of shut the fuck up.

2289
01:32:22,510 --> 01:32:25,530
Like you,
you have like there's these carp launch.

2290
01:32:26,080 --> 01:32:29,380
Yes.
There's these subjects that you can sort

2291
01:32:29,381 --> 01:32:32,320
of do like intersect or,
or um,

2292
01:32:32,620 --> 01:32:33,670
uh,
inject your,

2293
01:32:33,790 --> 01:32:34,623
your race into or your gender or the 
fact that you're trans or the fact that 

2294
01:32:38,040 --> 01:32:38,873
your allies and marginalized in any way 
Latino and you can kind of shut down 

2295
01:32:43,061 --> 01:32:43,660
discussion.

2296
01:32:43,660 --> 01:32:44,493
And it's one of the things that you see 
when this president is addressing the 

2297
01:32:47,471 --> 01:32:49,360
students and the students step up and 
they're asking,

2298
01:32:49,490 --> 01:32:52,120
there's this long,
it looks like a hostage negotiator.

2299
01:32:52,470 --> 01:32:55,570
That's what's fair.
They get up and they start talking about

2300
01:32:55,571 --> 01:32:59,920
their own individual identity and he 
told you about the color of my skin.

2301
01:32:59,980 --> 01:33:01,330
That's not my business,
but whatever it is,

2302
01:33:01,331 --> 01:33:02,164
the my,
the fact that I have a vagina and the 

2303
01:33:03,251 --> 01:33:04,084
fact that I would like to hear about my 
exams and it's that my wife's going to 

2304
01:33:07,121 --> 01:33:09,850
complain to be honest.
It becomes the thing,

2305
01:33:09,880 --> 01:33:10,713
you know,
it becomes the thing that you're 

2306
01:33:11,261 --> 01:33:14,230
discussing rather than whatever the 
actual thing you're discussing is.

2307
01:33:14,830 --> 01:33:17,710
That's the problem of identity politics.
It's not a form of politics.

2308
01:33:17,711 --> 01:33:20,620
It doesn't go anywhere.
It's designed to grind to the dialog,

2309
01:33:20,621 --> 01:33:21,454
to a halt and to give the person making 
the argument control of everyone else 

2310
01:33:25,121 --> 01:33:25,630
around them.

2311
01:33:25,630 --> 01:33:28,390
That's where it unjustly,
this person hasn't earned this.

2312
01:33:28,391 --> 01:33:29,171
Yeah.
That's where it is,

2313
01:33:29,171 --> 01:33:30,004
right?
It's like you have a total control of 

2314
01:33:32,231 --> 01:33:33,064
the conversation now and you have set 
like these very clear parameters and 

2315
01:33:37,331 --> 01:33:39,710
there's a lot of that man.
There's a lot of that sensor.

2316
01:33:39,970 --> 01:33:41,800
It is not,
it's not healthy.

2317
01:33:41,980 --> 01:33:46,410
It's just bizarre that that would fly in
a university setting and have his lattus

2318
01:33:46,420 --> 01:33:48,170
or agrees with it.
Yeah,

2319
01:33:48,190 --> 01:33:49,510
the Dean,
some of them,

2320
01:33:49,511 --> 01:33:53,020
but also they don't want to lose their 
jobs and students coming in,

2321
01:33:53,021 --> 01:33:53,854
you know they're going to change the 
world or they'll click a mob that look 

2322
01:33:57,420 --> 01:34:00,250
an enemy faction,
an Ami within these things.

2323
01:34:00,490 --> 01:34:01,031
And this,
this,

2324
01:34:01,031 --> 01:34:03,520
this is the reason that I'm so good at 
identifying this cause unwell.

2325
01:34:03,550 --> 01:34:05,910
Really well read in like power politics.
I mean if you want to read,

2326
01:34:05,911 --> 01:34:07,870
if you don't know what's going on,
we need to do is read the prints,

2327
01:34:07,871 --> 01:34:09,190
read Lindt scan,
read Robert Greene,

2328
01:34:09,730 --> 01:34:13,470
that'll teach you how to understand 
these people and these people are the,

2329
01:34:13,480 --> 01:34:15,220
I mean everything they're doing is about
power and control.

2330
01:34:15,340 --> 01:34:16,173
It's about,
it's about influence over what's going 

2331
01:34:18,131 --> 01:34:18,964
on.
And at any point you can break this 

2332
01:34:20,651 --> 01:34:23,140
influenced by just simply understanding 
how the gaining it.

2333
01:34:23,380 --> 01:34:24,213
I think Jordan Peterson has got some 
pretty unique insight into it because 

2334
01:34:26,681 --> 01:34:30,310
he's been dealing with it for several 
years and in a very high profile way.

2335
01:34:30,311 --> 01:34:33,370
But one of the things that he said that 
he believes it's about revenge,

2336
01:34:33,880 --> 01:34:34,713
he says he thinks that a lot of these 
people that are so active on campus and 

2337
01:34:37,481 --> 01:34:39,850
they're,
they're in this fever pitch,

2338
01:34:40,120 --> 01:34:40,953
he goes,
a lot of them were bullied and pushed 

2339
01:34:42,311 --> 01:34:43,144
around when they were younger and they 
were socially awkward and not in the 

2340
01:34:47,141 --> 01:34:47,974
good,
cool groups and now they want revenge 

2341
01:34:50,800 --> 01:34:51,633
and this is why they want to label 
everyone who plays sports as being some 

2342
01:34:55,001 --> 01:34:58,070
sort of a massage,
Enos woman raper you know,

2343
01:34:58,071 --> 01:34:59,660
I mean that's really what it is.

2344
01:34:59,660 --> 01:35:01,950
Like everyone who's in a frat house is 
a,

2345
01:35:01,960 --> 01:35:06,380
as a massage,
Dennis homophobic rapists like is no way

2346
01:35:06,381 --> 01:35:07,430
around it.
You're in a frat.

2347
01:35:07,490 --> 01:35:08,760
It's like the full,
yeah.

2348
01:35:08,761 --> 01:35:12,410
I like that woman who thought it was 
okay to say that that guy who got killed

2349
01:35:12,740 --> 01:35:13,573
like that,
they would do coke and rape girls in a 

2350
01:35:15,521 --> 01:35:16,490
frat party.
Like what?

2351
01:35:16,760 --> 01:35:18,380
Okay.
This is a caricature.

2352
01:35:18,610 --> 01:35:19,060
This,
I mean,

2353
01:35:19,060 --> 01:35:20,650
getting,
imagine if someone did a,

2354
01:35:20,660 --> 01:35:23,960
an equal caricature about a black man.
It's so racist counts.

2355
01:35:24,010 --> 01:35:26,510
Unbelievably racist.
It is racist,

2356
01:35:26,511 --> 01:35:28,630
but it's just,
it's also redefined racism and what this

2357
01:35:28,640 --> 01:35:29,473
will mean.
These guy's dead fucking got beaten to 

2358
01:35:32,481 --> 01:35:34,970
death taking a poster.
It's all he did.

2359
01:35:35,090 --> 01:35:35,923
But you're,
you're putting all these straw man 

2360
01:35:37,550 --> 01:35:42,050
definitions on this guy,
but all this guy did is andy young guys,

2361
01:35:42,051 --> 01:35:43,760
dumb thing.
I'm going to steal this poster.

2362
01:35:43,990 --> 01:35:45,050
He,
and he's dead now.

2363
01:35:45,120 --> 01:35:46,210
Like that's it.
It took the,

2364
01:35:46,230 --> 01:35:49,460
the fact that the regime,
you got no sympathy for him whatsoever.

2365
01:35:49,461 --> 01:35:50,780
What the Fuck's wrong with you?
Be Cool.

2366
01:35:50,781 --> 01:35:53,450
If he was Columbian,
if he was a Colombian American,

2367
01:35:53,451 --> 01:35:55,520
they beat him to death like that.
Would that be okay?

2368
01:35:56,420 --> 01:35:57,440
How would you feel then?
Would you,

2369
01:35:57,470 --> 01:36:00,200
would you come up with some sort of a 
Colombian,

2370
01:36:00,220 --> 01:36:01,053
uh,
influenced that he's got that you don't 

2371
01:36:02,151 --> 01:36:04,100
have,
and so he's got some sort of a Colombian

2372
01:36:04,101 --> 01:36:05,090
privilege,
but I mean,

2373
01:36:05,091 --> 01:36:06,200
how,
how is this not going,

2374
01:36:06,201 --> 01:36:08,300
not being hideously oppressed anyway,
he's been captured,

2375
01:36:08,301 --> 01:36:09,134
you know,
they'll take them by the North Koreans 

2376
01:36:09,621 --> 01:36:10,660
had been beaten to death.
Yeah.

2377
01:36:11,030 --> 01:36:11,863
Then they will literally,
I'll proof that your white male 

2378
01:36:12,711 --> 01:36:14,870
privilege isn't universal.
It's like,

2379
01:36:14,900 --> 01:36:15,590
oh,
you know,

2380
01:36:15,590 --> 01:36:16,430
if you're going to say that,
I mean,

2381
01:36:16,431 --> 01:36:17,990
you'd have to be a fucking moron.
Say that.

2382
01:36:17,991 --> 01:36:21,590
Because everything about the ideology 
itself is contextual.

2383
01:36:21,740 --> 01:36:23,960
It's power plus privilege.
They're full.

2384
01:36:24,110 --> 01:36:24,943
It must have a context.
There must be more white people around 

2385
01:36:27,321 --> 01:36:28,400
for it to work.
And therefore,

2386
01:36:28,401 --> 01:36:29,234
if we go to Zimbabwe,
white people are hideously oppressed by 

2387
01:36:31,191 --> 01:36:32,024
that definition in Zimbabwe when the 
white foam is getting the funds 

2388
01:36:33,770 --> 01:36:36,550
appropriated by black African Pan monks,
it's sort,

2389
01:36:36,610 --> 01:36:38,690
they are.
Then of course,

2390
01:36:38,691 --> 01:36:39,590
they're being oppressed.
Of course.

2391
01:36:39,591 --> 01:36:41,210
It's not universal.
Of course,

2392
01:36:41,240 --> 01:36:44,870
it's contextual.
It's the most asinine thing to say,

2393
01:36:45,560 --> 01:36:46,700
oh,
it's not universal.

2394
01:36:46,970 --> 01:36:50,470
Fucking de [inaudible] also universal 
what you were talking about.

2395
01:36:50,500 --> 01:36:52,770
I'm drinking up cause I'm really 
dehydrated and don't worry about it.

2396
01:36:53,010 --> 01:36:56,060
I'll have to hydrate myself.
Apologize for drinking water.

2397
01:36:56,061 --> 01:36:56,894
I don't know why.
I mean I know I'm consistently doing it 

2398
01:36:58,311 --> 01:37:00,080
and it's like don't worry about it man.
Yeah.

2399
01:37:00,200 --> 01:37:01,033
Um,
but I think it's also what you were 

2400
01:37:02,001 --> 01:37:04,370
talking about where they want to make it
all about them.

2401
01:37:04,370 --> 01:37:05,203
Like here this woman has taken this 
situation which is horribly tragic and 

2402
01:37:09,590 --> 01:37:10,423
now she's talking about students that 
she has to deal with that are white men 

2403
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:17,000
that are doing coke and raping girls at 
Frat parties and just like this guy.

2404
01:37:17,150 --> 01:37:20,300
What is this a horrible generalization.
They can,

2405
01:37:20,690 --> 01:37:21,523
they keep making it the stories as well,
but she's making about her and her 

2406
01:37:24,111 --> 01:37:24,944
classes and the guys that she had,
the clueless guy's that she has to deal 

2407
01:37:27,981 --> 01:37:28,814
with in her classes and she's just 
deciding that this guy is that without 

2408
01:37:32,270 --> 01:37:36,710
any personal knowledge of him at all.
But she's a future.

2409
01:37:36,711 --> 01:37:37,544
We've gone and she's turning it on 
herself and she's a victim because she 

2410
01:37:39,951 --> 01:37:43,280
has to deal with these students and 
these clueless white,

2411
01:37:43,281 --> 01:37:46,100
rich male students.
Fuck man.

2412
01:37:46,500 --> 01:37:49,160
I'm just saying.
His note twats out there.

2413
01:37:49,240 --> 01:37:50,073
They're a bunch of dudes who are 
shitheads and for sure there are just 

2414
01:37:52,881 --> 01:37:56,310
like there's women that suck to humans 
that suck.

2415
01:37:56,340 --> 01:37:57,173
It has nothing to do with gender or race
or that's racist to categorize them in 

2416
01:38:01,351 --> 01:38:03,990
that particular,
there's plenty of humans that are,

2417
01:38:03,991 --> 01:38:05,940
that happened to be white males that are
great,

2418
01:38:05,941 --> 01:38:07,830
that happened to be black women that are
great,

2419
01:38:07,831 --> 01:38:08,664
that Ha.
There's plenty of people that are cool 

2420
01:38:09,810 --> 01:38:14,760
across the board in every single gender 
race of course.

2421
01:38:14,761 --> 01:38:17,620
How you treat people as equals and 
shunts of the character.

2422
01:38:17,860 --> 01:38:18,693
I'm okay,
we send mean that's the right way to do 

2423
01:38:19,711 --> 01:38:20,544
things.
That's the most disturbing thing about 

2424
01:38:21,931 --> 01:38:24,510
this.
Is it a fucking professor who's teaching

2425
01:38:24,511 --> 01:38:25,344
young people is generalizing this 
horrendous way and she thinks it's okay 

2426
01:38:29,611 --> 01:38:33,270
because this kid stole a poster and what
did he think was going to happen?

2427
01:38:33,271 --> 01:38:35,130
What did he think was going to happen?
Jesus Christ.

2428
01:38:35,250 --> 01:38:37,440
When you're 20 years old,
you're not thinking,

2429
01:38:38,880 --> 01:38:41,040
how the fuck does this dummy not know 
that?

2430
01:38:41,220 --> 01:38:45,300
How does she not understand?
Just just the science of the development

2431
01:38:45,301 --> 01:38:46,134
of the human brain,
which has been clearly established over 

2432
01:38:47,521 --> 01:38:50,080
the past 2030 years.
20 when it finally,

2433
01:38:50,081 --> 01:38:53,620
step five is the frontal cortex this and
it's not even develops.

2434
01:38:53,621 --> 01:38:57,840
Kids do stupid things of course,
course unbelievably stupid.

2435
01:38:57,841 --> 01:38:59,280
And I have it.
I'm sure you have to,

2436
01:38:59,700 --> 01:39:00,533
especially if you have a deck.
There's something about being a dude 

2437
01:39:01,860 --> 01:39:03,620
that makes it dumber.
My mom's like,

2438
01:39:03,621 --> 01:39:05,190
do dumb shit.
My missus light look,

2439
01:39:05,240 --> 01:39:05,791
you know,
I don't,

2440
01:39:05,791 --> 01:39:07,320
I don't wanna sound like a big,
but it's always men.

2441
01:39:07,530 --> 01:39:08,363
It's always men,
but I just want to impress women or 

2442
01:39:09,421 --> 01:39:09,991
something like that.
It's,

2443
01:39:09,991 --> 01:39:11,000
well,
but let me,

2444
01:39:11,160 --> 01:39:14,390
let me educate you on something.
Please do at at,

2445
01:39:14,620 --> 01:39:18,540
and I'll put the wood.
We'll put the letters tw before it Twat.

2446
01:39:18,720 --> 01:39:19,860
Yes.
That's how you say it.

2447
01:39:19,930 --> 01:39:20,570
Yes.

2448
01:39:20,570 --> 01:39:23,700
If you're going to appropriate a 
language American now.

2449
01:39:23,701 --> 01:39:28,290
That's why we spelled tires and tire.
It's Twat.

2450
01:39:29,070 --> 01:39:30,180
Nice twins.
No,

2451
01:39:30,460 --> 01:39:32,730
it didn't say any way you want dude.
But I'm saying twice.

2452
01:39:33,040 --> 01:39:37,940
If I say it's flat and there's more of 
US 12 zero view.

2453
01:39:39,390 --> 01:39:41,190
We stole your language.
It,

2454
01:39:41,220 --> 01:39:42,001
man,
it's ours now.

2455
01:39:42,001 --> 01:39:42,990
It's American.
Right.

2456
01:39:42,991 --> 01:39:43,610
Okay.
So in,

2457
01:39:43,610 --> 01:39:44,311
in the future,
you know,

2458
01:39:44,311 --> 01:39:48,000
it won't be English anymore,
but like Latin became Spanish.

2459
01:39:49,200 --> 01:39:50,033
So I've got like another 10 minutes or 
anything else you want to talk about 

2460
01:39:51,660 --> 01:39:52,493
anything man?
What do you want to talk about besides 

2461
01:39:53,851 --> 01:39:54,840
our need?
Our sarkeys yeah.

2462
01:39:55,600 --> 01:39:56,670
Jesus Christ,
Bro.

2463
01:39:56,820 --> 01:39:59,460
She's going to be victimized by this 
pause.

2464
01:39:59,690 --> 01:40:00,241
Oh,
she's,

2465
01:40:00,241 --> 01:40:01,170
she's already pissed.
But yeah.

2466
01:40:01,190 --> 01:40:02,700
Anyway,
by the way,

2467
01:40:02,701 --> 01:40:04,350
I need a,
I got no hate for Ya.

2468
01:40:04,690 --> 01:40:05,700
All right,
so I'm not,

2469
01:40:05,850 --> 01:40:07,500
I'm not this too.
I haven't gone,

2470
01:40:07,530 --> 01:40:08,700
I talked to you just about that.

2471
01:40:08,710 --> 01:40:11,040
Macintosh should come on.
You should come on.

2472
01:40:11,730 --> 01:40:13,580
Um,
Jonathan McIntosh.

2473
01:40:13,581 --> 01:40:14,414
Yeah,
grow up.

2474
01:40:14,700 --> 01:40:18,270
There's a lot of those guys.
A lot of those vampire familiars.

2475
01:40:18,690 --> 01:40:19,523
You ever see the movie blade member,
the vampire familiar and hangs around 

2476
01:40:21,931 --> 01:40:25,020
with the vampires and thinks he's going 
to get in and they eventually kill him?

2477
01:40:25,040 --> 01:40:27,600
Yeah.
Same thing with the 30 days of night,

2478
01:40:27,720 --> 01:40:28,553
except the,
the vampire familiars don't usually 

2479
01:40:29,581 --> 01:40:33,570
sexually assault the vampires.
They rare those male feminist guys,

2480
01:40:33,571 --> 01:40:35,320
they really get that off.
I love the panels.

2481
01:40:35,321 --> 01:40:36,290
Will tweet.
Didn't,

2482
01:40:36,320 --> 01:40:37,160
he was like,
you know the,

2483
01:40:37,161 --> 01:40:38,400
the male feminists,
sexist,

2484
01:40:38,460 --> 01:40:40,840
sexual Predator is the sort of,
you know,

2485
01:40:40,930 --> 01:40:44,160
a Catholic priest must in children of 
our generation.

2486
01:40:44,760 --> 01:40:45,593
It's so true.
It is fucking true and a lot of ways I 

2487
01:40:47,881 --> 01:40:48,714
love male feminists.
That's just like the creepiest looking 

2488
01:40:50,401 --> 01:40:54,130
mother fuckers and then it tends either 
way if you're not that way

2489
01:40:54,130 --> 01:40:56,830
and you identify yourself as a feminist.
No,

2490
01:40:56,860 --> 01:40:58,590
I'm not talking about you.
I know what you're saying.

2491
01:40:58,610 --> 01:41:00,900
There's a lot of people out there that 
really wants to,

2492
01:41:01,250 --> 01:41:03,190
they get locked into it because it 
sounds,

2493
01:41:03,220 --> 01:41:04,600
it sounds right.
You know,

2494
01:41:04,601 --> 01:41:06,700
like,
oh are you free equal rights through him

2495
01:41:06,710 --> 01:41:07,660
and yeah.
Then you're a feminist.

2496
01:41:07,661 --> 01:41:09,730
Okay.
Then my feminist and you say it and then

2497
01:41:09,731 --> 01:41:11,400
people treat you differently because you
say,

2498
01:41:11,410 --> 01:41:13,360
because of they said,
well you've done a good job,

2499
01:41:13,361 --> 01:41:15,010
billy.
I'm going to pat you on the head.

2500
01:41:15,190 --> 01:41:16,880
You called yourself a feminist.
Yeah.

2501
01:41:17,050 --> 01:41:18,460
Why'd you define yourself,
man?

2502
01:41:18,490 --> 01:41:21,810
Are you a human like every good human 
wants equality.

2503
01:41:21,860 --> 01:41:24,100
I'll ring good yo like many labels as 
well.

2504
01:41:24,101 --> 01:41:26,950
You know why you're denying sexism.
Like,

2505
01:41:26,951 --> 01:41:27,784
you know,
like you don't have to be a pro black 

2506
01:41:29,860 --> 01:41:32,680
ally deny,
uh,

2507
01:41:32,710 --> 01:41:33,700
or to,
to rather,

2508
01:41:33,730 --> 01:41:34,563
uh,
deny accepting any form of racism or 

2509
01:41:38,230 --> 01:41:39,510
not.
That's a bad way.

2510
01:41:39,530 --> 01:41:39,970
Describe

2511
01:41:39,970 --> 01:41:41,260
it.
It's how they define these things.

2512
01:41:41,261 --> 01:41:41,731
If,
if the,

2513
01:41:41,731 --> 01:41:44,290
if they have a different definition,
if they say where it's structural,

2514
01:41:44,590 --> 01:41:45,401
it's a,
you know,

2515
01:41:45,401 --> 01:41:46,234
like,
um,

2516
01:41:46,280 --> 01:41:47,650
institution,
we'll talk about racism.

2517
01:41:47,690 --> 01:41:50,020
It's an easier way of framing it and you
say,

2518
01:41:50,021 --> 01:41:50,411
well,
you know,

2519
01:41:50,411 --> 01:41:51,244
I think a racism,
I don't think the structures are 

2520
01:41:52,631 --> 01:41:54,420
actually racist.
I think that the individuals,

2521
01:41:54,430 --> 01:41:56,680
certain individuals within the 
structures are racist.

2522
01:41:57,040 --> 01:41:59,680
Then what you're doing is undermining 
their entire philosophy.

2523
01:41:59,980 --> 01:42:00,813
And if you're undermining their entire 
philosophy by effectively 

2524
01:42:04,121 --> 01:42:05,920
individualizing it,
robin collectivizing it,

2525
01:42:06,250 --> 01:42:08,910
then they have to consider you an enemy 
because what you'll,

2526
01:42:09,040 --> 01:42:10,150
if everyone,
if you go,

2527
01:42:10,151 --> 01:42:11,350
yeah,
and then someone else goes,

2528
01:42:11,351 --> 01:42:12,390
you know,
that's a good way of looking at,

2529
01:42:12,391 --> 01:42:14,470
I don't look at that too.
And then a lot of people got,

2530
01:42:14,471 --> 01:42:15,520
you know,
that's a great point.

2531
01:42:15,910 --> 01:42:18,910
Then suddenly their philosophy is just 
going to collapse.

2532
01:42:19,300 --> 01:42:21,250
No one's going to believe what they're 
saying and they can be like,

2533
01:42:21,251 --> 01:42:22,084
no,
but this is what I'm being horribly 

2534
01:42:23,171 --> 01:42:23,730
oppressed.
Never.

2535
01:42:23,730 --> 01:42:24,280
I was like,
well,

2536
01:42:24,280 --> 01:42:25,630
not really.
There are some racist,

2537
01:42:25,631 --> 01:42:26,990
but we deal with them.
We've got the balls,

2538
01:42:27,190 --> 01:42:28,750
you know,
we've got laws against racism,

2539
01:42:28,751 --> 01:42:29,584
we've got laws,
the affirmative action laws to bring 

2540
01:42:31,301 --> 01:42:32,134
black people and you know,
I don't think the system is actually as 

2541
01:42:33,521 --> 01:42:34,354
racist as you're saying.
I think that maybe there were a few bad 

2542
01:42:35,411 --> 01:42:37,810
actors and when we see when we can spot 
them and get them,

2543
01:42:38,050 --> 01:42:38,883
get them out,
you know,

2544
01:42:39,160 --> 01:42:39,993
then what,
how these people going to play the 

2545
01:42:40,751 --> 01:42:41,584
victim when they get to play the victim.
There's real racism and there's also 

2546
01:42:44,980 --> 01:42:47,260
real people playing the victim and 
there's bolt,

2547
01:42:47,360 --> 01:42:49,000
of course there's real racism,
but we're vigilant.

2548
01:42:49,001 --> 01:42:50,560
Flat.
Where are racist?

2549
01:42:50,561 --> 01:42:53,250
Just tolerated well.
Oh the president now.

2550
01:42:53,860 --> 01:42:54,910
Exactly that.
The president,

2551
01:42:54,911 --> 01:42:55,900
that company's racist.
Yeah.

2552
01:42:55,901 --> 01:42:57,610
Well we're just going to leave him 
because you know,

2553
01:42:57,680 --> 01:42:59,290
he's just like,
you know,

2554
01:42:59,320 --> 01:43:00,153
he sees all right.
You still didn't get jump and of course 

2555
01:43:01,211 --> 01:43:02,044
he's not there.
He's going to be out of the door for 

2556
01:43:03,251 --> 01:43:04,084
sure.
They frame Pewdie Pie as being someone 

2557
01:43:06,491 --> 01:43:08,440
who may have been spreading 
antisemitism,

2558
01:43:08,441 --> 01:43:10,900
which he always got some like millions 
of followers though.

2559
01:43:11,020 --> 01:43:12,250
Well they did like two,
3 million,

2560
01:43:12,251 --> 01:43:13,960
but they constantly were millions of 
dollars.

2561
01:43:14,460 --> 01:43:17,020
But I think ultimately it'll probably 
balances itself out.

2562
01:43:17,640 --> 01:43:19,860
It's already gone in his favor.
Everyone fuck themselves.

2563
01:43:20,010 --> 01:43:20,843
Yeah.
But that's only because there was a 

2564
01:43:21,131 --> 01:43:23,620
credible alternative media.
I mean like pd Pie.

2565
01:43:23,621 --> 01:43:24,131
Uh,
there's,

2566
01:43:24,131 --> 01:43:25,470
there's me and another youtube,
nickel,

2567
01:43:25,480 --> 01:43:26,313
crowns and TV.
Both made videos about what's his name 

2568
01:43:27,350 --> 01:43:28,990
was talking so fast.
You want to add overall?

2569
01:43:29,320 --> 01:43:29,951
No,
it's just,

2570
01:43:29,951 --> 01:43:31,090
there's so much I need to tell you.

2571
01:43:31,180 --> 01:43:32,013
Oh,
I'm probably not going to be here again 

2572
01:43:32,730 --> 01:43:33,970
and there's a lot you need to know,
man.

2573
01:43:33,971 --> 01:43:34,804
You coming back.
I'd love to know what I've had it been 

2574
01:43:37,301 --> 01:43:38,640
most sleep as well.
I don't do anything.

2575
01:43:38,890 --> 01:43:42,370
But anyway,
a youtube called crowds and t crowds and

2576
01:43:42,400 --> 01:43:43,540
t,
he's a German guy,

2577
01:43:43,870 --> 01:43:46,600
uh,
Kraut and t o t like the,

2578
01:43:47,260 --> 01:43:48,730
cause he's half English,
half German.

2579
01:43:49,150 --> 01:43:49,810
Oh,
I get it.

2580
01:43:49,810 --> 01:43:50,950
Um,
and,

2581
01:43:50,960 --> 01:43:53,540
uh,
he did a video about this as well.

2582
01:43:53,570 --> 01:43:54,403
I did a video about this and p Dubai did
a video using the information as the 

2583
01:43:57,651 --> 01:43:58,484
systems we've compiled to be like,
to do his own video and used us as 

2584
01:44:01,131 --> 01:44:01,964
sources.
St Let the smoke got this information 

2585
01:44:03,200 --> 01:44:04,040
and he'd swing out.
And I was like,

2586
01:44:04,041 --> 01:44:05,900
Holy Shit,
that's really nice of him.

2587
01:44:06,200 --> 01:44:10,160
But it's really interesting how we 
helped him fight back because he's not,

2588
01:44:10,161 --> 01:44:11,000
he's a comedian,
you know,

2589
01:44:11,001 --> 01:44:12,530
he doesn't do all this professionally.

2590
01:44:12,530 --> 01:44:14,330
He doesn't know what to look for,
you know,

2591
01:44:14,331 --> 01:44:15,310
new one.
Why would he,

2592
01:44:15,311 --> 01:44:16,144
you know,
would,

2593
01:44:16,430 --> 01:44:19,130
you wouldn't expend too,
but luckily this was a house speciality.

2594
01:44:19,460 --> 01:44:20,293
We've been going,
it's the media since day one because we 

2595
01:44:21,741 --> 01:44:23,930
know there are a bunch of liars.
We know they are.

2596
01:44:24,140 --> 01:44:27,230
Some of them are right.
There's gotta be not all of them.

2597
01:44:27,700 --> 01:44:30,270
There's got to be good journalists.
That's no excuse.

2598
01:44:30,271 --> 01:44:32,360
So you now have a platform where the 
Wall Street Journal,

2599
01:44:32,450 --> 01:44:35,300
if you want to maintain your reputation,
you don't publish shit like that.

2600
01:44:35,950 --> 01:44:36,783
Unaccepted.
What is their response that then Kevin 

2601
01:44:38,270 --> 01:44:39,590
don't address it.
That's why.

2602
01:44:39,591 --> 01:44:41,120
Should,
that seems so crazy.

2603
01:44:41,121 --> 01:44:41,954
That's it.
They can't,

2604
01:44:42,170 --> 01:44:45,680
they should address that.
Absolutely.

2605
01:44:45,681 --> 01:44:46,514
The ship.
I mean there's no sue them and now I 

2606
01:44:48,201 --> 01:44:49,760
don't think he sued them.
Why?

2607
01:44:49,790 --> 01:44:51,650
I don't know.
I don't think he wants the trouble.

2608
01:44:52,880 --> 01:44:54,610
If he sued the monk back in,
I believe,

2609
01:44:54,630 --> 01:44:55,880
dude,
you think you would win?

2610
01:44:55,980 --> 01:44:57,470
Oh God.
Can't see how he could lose,

2611
01:44:58,010 --> 01:44:58,843
you know,
what can you prove they cost you money 

2612
01:45:00,290 --> 01:45:01,380
easily?
Yeah.

2613
01:45:01,610 --> 01:45:04,730
Is this actual antisemitism?
Obviously not.

2614
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:06,980
Yeah.
Did they take you out of context?

2615
01:45:06,981 --> 01:45:07,814
Clearly and in fact,
what are the jokes was that they would 

2616
01:45:10,221 --> 01:45:13,370
take him out of context?
How could he lose this?

2617
01:45:13,400 --> 01:45:16,760
Yeah.
Well some it is possible.

2618
01:45:17,560 --> 01:45:18,393
What he should do is find out how much 
the Wall Street Journal cost to buy and 

2619
01:45:20,511 --> 01:45:25,490
then crowdfunded and I donate to that.
I spread it around.

2620
01:45:25,580 --> 01:45:26,250
Yeah.
What was the,

2621
01:45:26,250 --> 01:45:27,083
there was a lawsuit,
recent lawsuit that I couldn't believe 

2622
01:45:30,110 --> 01:45:31,400
was thrown out.
God Damn it.

2623
01:45:31,401 --> 01:45:33,990
And I can't remember it now,
Eh.

2624
01:45:35,150 --> 01:45:37,340
And I remember laying a few hundred 
million dollars,

2625
01:45:37,341 --> 01:45:38,174
but like,
I mean he's got 55 million subscribers 

2626
01:45:39,891 --> 01:45:40,724
and he's a very influential man.
Then there are a lot of people who like 

2627
01:45:42,081 --> 01:45:44,540
him who would love to support.
Maybe it's possible.

2628
01:45:44,540 --> 01:45:46,700
Maybe he could,
maybe he could speak to,

2629
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:49,400
I know some nice wealthy benefactors who
are like,

2630
01:45:49,401 --> 01:45:50,480
you know what?
I hate these people.

2631
01:45:50,540 --> 01:45:54,020
Like Peter Teal Guy,
what he did with Hulk Hogan versus,

2632
01:45:54,050 --> 01:45:55,290
exactly.
Yeah.

2633
01:45:55,370 --> 01:45:56,203
Why not?
Wouldn't it just be the funniest thing 

2634
01:45:57,441 --> 01:45:58,360
in the world?
CPD pies,

2635
01:45:58,370 --> 01:46:02,690
the owner of the Wall Street Journal.
Just be hilarious.

2636
01:46:02,750 --> 01:46:03,583
Perfect.
You know,

2637
01:46:03,920 --> 01:46:04,753
and it wouldn't be the wealthy 
billionaires who happened to be 

2638
01:46:06,740 --> 01:46:08,930
obviously wealthy having to be watching 
this and you know what?

2639
01:46:08,931 --> 01:46:09,764
We could get one over on these bitches 
and that we don't have to just let them 

2640
01:46:11,991 --> 01:46:12,824
win.
We don't have to just let them when we 

2641
01:46:14,121 --> 01:46:14,954
could.
We might feel like the New York Times 

2642
01:46:16,341 --> 01:46:18,970
feels incredibly challenged right now.
Jenna,

2643
01:46:19,010 --> 01:46:21,080
we were talking about,
I know the New York Times,

2644
01:46:21,320 --> 01:46:23,470
just making sure I was going to say with
you,

2645
01:46:23,480 --> 01:46:25,340
just,
you're just so ready to go.

2646
01:46:25,400 --> 01:46:27,500
I am just so much words,
unfortunately.

2647
01:46:28,140 --> 01:46:30,110
I know you don't have much time,
but about us.

2648
01:46:30,111 --> 01:46:31,580
Donald Trump was going to say.
Yeah,

2649
01:46:31,581 --> 01:46:32,470
I wish I had.
I wish I had.

2650
01:46:32,660 --> 01:46:35,180
Was there any way you could reschedule 
or schedule your flight?

2651
01:46:35,210 --> 01:46:36,060
Do you need,
I could just,

2652
01:46:36,270 --> 01:46:37,280
I mean,
if you want to carry on,

2653
01:46:37,281 --> 01:46:38,114
I could just cancel 10 if you,
I just want to make sure you don't get 

2654
01:46:40,251 --> 01:46:41,240
stuck here.
Well,

2655
01:46:41,241 --> 01:46:44,290
I can just buy another ticket tomorrow.
Are you sure it will cost me a fortune,

2656
01:46:44,291 --> 01:46:45,350
but it's fine.
Well,

2657
01:46:45,351 --> 01:46:48,540
a fortune for an hour of podcasting 
seems one over it.

2658
01:46:49,170 --> 01:46:50,003
You've only got an hour.

2659
01:46:50,100 --> 01:46:53,820
I've got another hour and Japan probably
more.

2660
01:46:53,821 --> 01:46:55,230
It's probably a thousand pounds.
I probably shouldn't.

2661
01:46:55,231 --> 01:46:57,780
What's a thousand pounds?
$1,200

2662
01:46:58,050 --> 01:46:59,700
will take care of it.
Really?

2663
01:46:59,790 --> 01:47:01,110
Yeah.
We'll put it on the budget.

2664
01:47:01,111 --> 01:47:02,430
What the fuck am I gonna do for the rest
of the day?

2665
01:47:02,460 --> 01:47:03,300
We're going to hang out,
man.

2666
01:47:03,540 --> 01:47:05,330
You're going to go to the movies?
Yes,

2667
01:47:05,400 --> 01:47:07,920
there have an ice cream.
Well,

2668
01:47:07,921 --> 01:47:10,050
I'm going to get a decision.
I don't know what you're going to do,

2669
01:47:10,051 --> 01:47:10,884
dude.
If you want to do another hour of 

2670
01:47:12,161 --> 01:47:12,994
podcasting,
we can.

2671
01:47:13,260 --> 01:47:15,300
We should just say we were supposed to 
start at nine.

2672
01:47:15,330 --> 01:47:17,850
We're a little late because of traffic 
here is insane.

2673
01:47:17,851 --> 01:47:18,684
My wife's gonna kill me.
You was going to kill if you don't come 

2674
01:47:19,951 --> 01:47:21,090
home think,
oh man.

2675
01:47:22,080 --> 01:47:23,610
She'll understand that.
You sure?

2676
01:47:23,670 --> 01:47:25,110
Yeah.
Mixed messages.

2677
01:47:25,380 --> 01:47:26,820
She understand she's going to kill you.
This Sheila.

2678
01:47:27,040 --> 01:47:27,910
All right,
so we keep going.

2679
01:47:28,860 --> 01:47:29,693
So where were we?

2680
01:47:29,930 --> 01:47:32,490
We were wasting money by buying the 
wallstreet journal with Keith teals.

2681
01:47:32,491 --> 01:47:33,480
Money.
Yeah.

2682
01:47:33,630 --> 01:47:34,463
Well,
what I was saying is that the New York 

2683
01:47:35,731 --> 01:47:36,564
Times feels very challenged by donald 
trump's dismissal of them is fake news 

2684
01:47:40,771 --> 01:47:43,650
and all these different attacks.
And because of that they sort of doubled

2685
01:47:43,651 --> 01:47:44,484
down on the ethics of journalism.
They tried really hard to be better at 

2686
01:47:47,731 --> 01:47:48,890
what they do.
Yeah,

2687
01:47:48,900 --> 01:47:49,650
yeah.
I saw,

2688
01:47:49,650 --> 01:47:50,540
yeah,
they actually,

2689
01:47:50,730 --> 01:47:52,830
but that's a real indictment of the 
state of journalism,

2690
01:47:52,831 --> 01:47:54,110
isn't it?
When they have to do is a little bit,

2691
01:47:54,240 --> 01:47:56,700
we're going to recommit ourselves to 
actually being journalists.

2692
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:58,650
Good thinking.
We'll stay in Houston,

2693
01:47:58,680 --> 01:48:03,540
New York Times called out in a way that 
they've never been called out before.

2694
01:48:03,600 --> 01:48:04,920
Of course they did lose.
Yeah.

2695
01:48:04,921 --> 01:48:05,880
I mean,
he's the president.

2696
01:48:05,881 --> 01:48:08,040
They became political activists.
They weren't generalists.

2697
01:48:08,041 --> 01:48:10,740
They rise and they were on the losing 
side,

2698
01:48:11,220 --> 01:48:12,210
get ranked,
you know,

2699
01:48:12,211 --> 01:48:13,530
of course you've got to suddenly go,
well,

2700
01:48:13,531 --> 01:48:14,081
okay,
hold on,

2701
01:48:14,081 --> 01:48:14,330
hands up.

2702
01:48:14,330 --> 01:48:15,090
I can't,
let's,

2703
01:48:15,090 --> 01:48:19,290
let's try not being a lie as anymore.
What does that trickle down from?

2704
01:48:19,291 --> 01:48:20,124
Is it from the editors who lost sight?
Is it the writers themselves that they 

2705
01:48:22,981 --> 01:48:23,814
hire?
Is it the ethics behind the business of 

2706
01:48:25,141 --> 01:48:27,780
the magazine or the of the newspaper?
Unfortunate.

2707
01:48:27,781 --> 01:48:30,740
I don't know the ins and outs of the,
I mean if he had a Spec,

2708
01:48:30,840 --> 01:48:32,080
I don't know.
If I had to speculate,

2709
01:48:32,081 --> 01:48:33,780
I'd probably say it's coming from the 
top and they're just like,

2710
01:48:33,781 --> 01:48:35,580
what the fuck is happening?
Right.

2711
01:48:35,670 --> 01:48:37,860
Like we're seeing with these tech 
companies,

2712
01:48:38,370 --> 01:48:39,203
like we're seeing with these people that
are like uber progressive in Google or 

2713
01:48:41,911 --> 01:48:43,580
wherever the fuck they are.
Yup.

2714
01:48:43,800 --> 01:48:45,090
Yeah.
It's a weird thing,

2715
01:48:45,091 --> 01:48:45,541
man.
We're,

2716
01:48:45,541 --> 01:48:47,820
we're dealing with a real,
I mean,

2717
01:48:47,821 --> 01:48:49,740
I hate to use the word,
but it's the real word.

2718
01:48:49,741 --> 01:48:51,120
Cultural War.
Yeah,

2719
01:48:51,121 --> 01:48:52,370
it is.
I mean that's the term.

2720
01:48:52,370 --> 01:48:54,360
It's the correct term.
Block culture warriors.

2721
01:48:55,020 --> 01:48:57,570
And this is why this is when I turn this
in,

2722
01:48:57,571 --> 01:48:58,404
like power politics because they all are
attacking people that you mean like 

2723
01:49:01,321 --> 01:49:02,790
attacking pd pie that costing them 
money.

2724
01:49:02,791 --> 01:49:04,710
I mean they didn't even publish their 
article.

2725
01:49:04,711 --> 01:49:05,544
The Wall Street Journal didn't even 
publish the rascal before they had gone 

2726
01:49:08,371 --> 01:49:11,040
to Disney and got them to pull them 
money from him.

2727
01:49:11,280 --> 01:49:13,740
Wow.
Brought it to Disney.

2728
01:49:14,970 --> 01:49:15,803
How?
See how just because they heard that he 

2729
01:49:17,761 --> 01:49:19,890
was getting this big fat deal from 
Disney and they were like,

2730
01:49:19,891 --> 01:49:22,620
fuck this guy is cause pd pie doesn't 
play ball with them.

2731
01:49:22,980 --> 01:49:23,813
Does he say ball and how so?
He's not a progressive but oh he's a 

2732
01:49:26,821 --> 01:49:28,080
liberal.
He doesn't sit there going,

2733
01:49:28,320 --> 01:49:30,720
oh well you know feminism's good idea 
guys.

2734
01:49:30,721 --> 01:49:31,554
And he's not,
he's red pilling the the new generation 

2735
01:49:33,121 --> 01:49:33,954
about feminism.
He makes anti-feminism fuzzy videos 

2736
01:49:35,610 --> 01:49:36,420
every now and again.

2737
01:49:36,420 --> 01:49:38,370
And they're actually quite funny.
You'd people should check him out.

2738
01:49:38,850 --> 01:49:41,220
He's just bragging on this cause it's 
stupid shit.

2739
01:49:41,240 --> 01:49:42,073
You know,
it's the sort of stupid shit like we've 

2740
01:49:42,781 --> 01:49:46,800
been talking about and rightly so.
This is bollocks and it's good that he's

2741
01:49:46,870 --> 01:49:47,703
telling kids,
look,

2742
01:49:47,890 --> 01:49:50,710
this is crap t just treat people well.
You know,

2743
01:49:51,040 --> 01:49:54,190
like just treat people as an individual.
Ma Ma say madame,

2744
01:49:54,200 --> 01:49:55,033
of course it is crap,
but I don't even think it's being sort 

2745
01:49:56,861 --> 01:50:00,220
of like it's eroding the same way male 
feminism is eroding.

2746
01:50:00,400 --> 01:50:04,540
That term is a very derogatory term.
We call someone a male feminist.

2747
01:50:04,930 --> 01:50:06,080
Most people just go,
Ugh,

2748
01:50:06,490 --> 01:50:08,350
if you call someone a social justice 
warrior,

2749
01:50:08,351 --> 01:50:12,700
I mean that is a term now that term is 
not something that someone carries.

2750
01:50:12,820 --> 01:50:14,320
There was a while where people were 
like,

2751
01:50:14,350 --> 01:50:15,760
I read quotes like,
yeah,

2752
01:50:15,761 --> 01:50:17,320
we are warriors.
Like what?

2753
01:50:17,350 --> 01:50:18,580
Yeah,
like I mean the beginning,

2754
01:50:18,581 --> 01:50:20,230
they were like embracing it.
Yeah.

2755
01:50:20,320 --> 01:50:22,580
I mean it's not a an sjw on the Joe 
Rogan podcast,

2756
01:50:22,581 --> 01:50:24,280
don't you let the number one podcast in 
the world.

2757
01:50:24,490 --> 01:50:26,140
It's probably up there.
Yeah.

2758
01:50:26,690 --> 01:50:28,110
It's not an sjw sign.
Hey telling me,

2759
01:50:28,270 --> 01:50:29,050
listen,
let me tell you.

2760
01:50:29,050 --> 01:50:30,610
Let me tell you how to check your 
privilege show.

2761
01:50:30,940 --> 01:50:32,380
No,
I haven't had one of those on.

2762
01:50:32,650 --> 01:50:34,300
I would be,
I would be fascinated.

2763
01:50:34,630 --> 01:50:36,890
You should get one on just to pick the 
brain.

2764
01:50:36,930 --> 01:50:37,960
No worries.
Studio is,

2765
01:50:37,961 --> 01:50:39,340
and you have to talk to them for an 
hour.

2766
01:50:39,370 --> 01:50:40,260
Yeah.
But I mean,

2767
01:50:40,300 --> 01:50:41,890
I can tell you what they think.
So I've spoken to him.

2768
01:50:42,100 --> 01:50:43,340
I mean,
so pete,

2769
01:50:43,380 --> 01:50:45,140
that's a cop out because the people who 
have looked,

2770
01:50:45,141 --> 01:50:47,620
you're your bird show bolts was your 
boss was like,

2771
01:50:48,040 --> 01:50:49,180
no,
actually I shouldn't.

2772
01:50:49,450 --> 01:50:51,820
I should just talk.
I'm just not interested in you.

2773
01:50:51,910 --> 01:50:52,743
Yeah.
Well you're creepy and weird and you've 

2774
01:50:53,970 --> 01:50:55,780
probably harass someone.
So there's some,

2775
01:50:56,140 --> 01:50:56,973
there's some merit to having these 
volatile discussions with people that 

2776
01:50:59,981 --> 01:51:00,940
you disagree with.
Oh yeah.

2777
01:51:00,941 --> 01:51:01,774
I like it.
It's also people keep asking me to 

2778
01:51:03,040 --> 01:51:03,830
Richard Spencer,
so,

2779
01:51:03,830 --> 01:51:05,380
yeah.
But I've told her stay wes already.

2780
01:51:05,710 --> 01:51:06,940
I know what the identitarian is 
thinking.

2781
01:51:06,941 --> 01:51:08,290
I mean,
whenever every time,

2782
01:51:08,291 --> 01:51:09,760
like someone that camp black is that 
they're going,

2783
01:51:09,761 --> 01:51:10,960
oh,
let me tell you about my blackness.

2784
01:51:11,170 --> 01:51:13,950
It's,
he's a youtuber called cab black.

2785
01:51:14,050 --> 01:51:15,520
Oh,
you're deep in the youtube world.

2786
01:51:15,550 --> 01:51:16,480
Oh yeah,
of course I am.

2787
01:51:16,580 --> 01:51:18,640
If you refer to him like we all know who
you're talking about.

2788
01:51:18,641 --> 01:51:19,301
Yeah.
Sorry.

2789
01:51:19,301 --> 01:51:21,240
But she,
she's actually really good talking about

2790
01:51:21,370 --> 01:51:22,470
call row.
Yeah.

2791
01:51:22,720 --> 01:51:24,040
She's like,
she's black transits you,

2792
01:51:24,041 --> 01:51:24,874
but she's actually great and people are 
going to be surprised to hear me say 

2793
01:51:26,921 --> 01:51:28,290
that,
but I've never done a video,

2794
01:51:28,291 --> 01:51:30,100
a bouncer because she's not full of 
Shit.

2795
01:51:30,640 --> 01:51:31,473
She's just an identity.
Tarian but that doesn't mean that she's 

2796
01:51:33,370 --> 01:51:34,203
bad or anything like this.
That just means she talks about herself 

2797
01:51:36,311 --> 01:51:37,144
a lot.
Um,

2798
01:51:37,580 --> 01:51:41,050
but she's actually got this really great
streak in her that's really fair.

2799
01:51:41,410 --> 01:51:42,400
And so when the,
I mean,

2800
01:51:42,401 --> 01:51:43,234
these people run like lemmings off cliff
when they get an idea in their head 

2801
01:51:45,941 --> 01:51:46,774
that,
oh my God,

2802
01:51:46,870 --> 01:51:47,703
yes,
we should all,

2803
01:51:47,870 --> 01:51:48,940
you know,
jump on.

2804
01:51:49,130 --> 01:51:49,720
Yeah.
You know,

2805
01:51:49,720 --> 01:51:50,553
like Lacy Green,
when she abandons their community or 

2806
01:51:52,331 --> 01:51:52,741
something,
you know,

2807
01:51:52,741 --> 01:51:54,820
there was a lacy green,
she's another youtube on,

2808
01:51:54,821 --> 01:51:57,030
so she is Christ church,
right?

2809
01:51:57,100 --> 01:51:58,630
You're in youtube.
You should allegedly,

2810
01:51:58,880 --> 01:52:00,970
um,
who is a lacy green,

2811
01:52:00,971 --> 01:52:01,804
what does she's,
she's a feminist who realized how toxic 

2812
01:52:04,660 --> 01:52:07,570
the community that she was part of 
millions of subscribers.

2813
01:52:08,080 --> 01:52:08,801
Oh,
wait a minute.

2814
01:52:08,801 --> 01:52:13,801
Is she the girl that was it turned out 
was dating some sort of Reagan,

2815
01:52:14,020 --> 01:52:18,250
some guy.
Who is he Indian?

2816
01:52:18,280 --> 01:52:19,113
Rj?
No.

2817
01:52:20,490 --> 01:52:21,470
Are you joking around?
But he,

2818
01:52:21,471 --> 01:52:22,251
yeah,
he's probably,

2819
01:52:22,251 --> 01:52:22,610
well,
okay,

2820
01:52:22,610 --> 01:52:24,010
well I don't give a fuck if he's 
watching it,

2821
01:52:24,170 --> 01:52:25,930
but try to follow this up.
I'm going to talk to him later.

2822
01:52:26,030 --> 01:52:26,420
Yeah.
No,

2823
01:52:26,420 --> 01:52:28,640
he's not in the end Nazi on pc.
Jesus Christ.

2824
01:52:29,660 --> 01:52:33,830
What was his deal though?
They start dating like a,

2825
01:52:33,900 --> 01:52:36,020
he's just an anti,
he's NCSD WWII cheap.

2826
01:52:36,021 --> 01:52:36,850
Let me,
Oh,

2827
01:52:36,850 --> 01:52:37,760
he's,
he's pretty liberal.

2828
01:52:37,780 --> 01:52:38,511
Yeah.
That's what it is.

2829
01:52:38,511 --> 01:52:41,180
Okay.
So he's an anti s j w person.

2830
01:52:41,181 --> 01:52:41,921
That's what he is.
Yeah.

2831
01:52:41,921 --> 01:52:44,030
So what basically disaffected liberals 
mostly.

2832
01:52:44,540 --> 01:52:45,373
And so anti identity people got mad at 
her because she was dating this guy who 

2833
01:52:50,121 --> 01:52:51,260
they don't agree with.
Yeah.

2834
01:52:51,410 --> 01:52:53,360
Because he's against feminism and black 
lives matter.

2835
01:52:53,750 --> 01:52:54,583
Why does it,
why do people give a fuck who people 

2836
01:52:55,341 --> 01:52:56,750
date?
Why is that a pause then?

2837
01:52:56,751 --> 01:52:59,880
Controlling psycho cultists.
Mm.

2838
01:52:59,960 --> 01:53:01,850
And they dragged her all across social 
media.

2839
01:53:01,850 --> 01:53:02,910
I mean,
some of the worst things I've,

2840
01:53:02,990 --> 01:53:04,070
I've seen.
Really?

2841
01:53:04,160 --> 01:53:04,611
Oh yeah,
yeah,

2842
01:53:04,611 --> 01:53:06,680
absolutely.
And what did they talk about?

2843
01:53:07,190 --> 01:53:08,150
Oh,
like,

2844
01:53:08,480 --> 01:53:09,313
just so you know,
I mean like one thing that annoys me is 

2845
01:53:11,121 --> 01:53:12,020
that like,
you know,

2846
01:53:12,050 --> 01:53:13,400
six months ago everyone was like,
yeah,

2847
01:53:13,401 --> 01:53:14,510
we love Lisa Green,
she's great,

2848
01:53:14,511 --> 01:53:16,250
she's a feminist,
she's a sex Ed,

2849
01:53:16,251 --> 01:53:16,941
stuff's brilliant,
blah,

2850
01:53:16,941 --> 01:53:17,750
blah,
blah.

2851
01:53:17,750 --> 01:53:18,830
And then as soon as she's like,
you know,

2852
01:53:18,831 --> 01:53:20,300
I kind of,
I met this guy,

2853
01:53:20,301 --> 01:53:21,134
I like this guy and he's actually making
some really good points that like your 

2854
01:53:24,120 --> 01:53:27,620
sex ed stuff sucked.
You suck everything you've ever done,

2855
01:53:27,621 --> 01:53:28,700
suck.
Get out of [inaudible].

2856
01:53:28,970 --> 01:53:31,400
And then,
I mean she gets death threats and things

2857
01:53:31,401 --> 01:53:33,140
like that and she used to get them from 
like,

2858
01:53:33,170 --> 01:53:35,980
I guess like I'll write a types who were
in the basements or something who hate,

2859
01:53:36,320 --> 01:53:38,370
but now again,
she gets it from stw Thomas.

2860
01:53:38,560 --> 01:53:40,740
I with people would just not send 
threats and shit.

2861
01:53:40,760 --> 01:53:42,350
It doesn't do anything.
It just makes,

2862
01:53:42,351 --> 01:53:44,840
it's just nasty for people.
Well definitely is that,

2863
01:53:44,841 --> 01:53:48,200
but it's just,
it's so sad that someone can't just date

2864
01:53:48,201 --> 01:53:49,950
someone that they don't agree with.
Yes.

2865
01:53:49,970 --> 01:53:50,803
Fuck me.
Like she obviously likes the guy of 

2866
01:53:53,031 --> 01:53:55,370
course is you can't change your opinion 
either.

2867
01:53:56,260 --> 01:54:00,550
You're cleaning can't evolve.
It can't be a flip flopper yeah.

2868
01:54:00,570 --> 01:54:03,590
In like can you even control what you 
believe?

2869
01:54:04,920 --> 01:54:08,540
I believe that you could,
but then and what did I just say?

2870
01:54:08,600 --> 01:54:11,780
Believe that I believe that I could 
control what I believe.

2871
01:54:11,890 --> 01:54:12,723
Yeah,
exactly.

2872
01:54:13,380 --> 01:54:14,540
So now you don't believe it,
right?

2873
01:54:14,541 --> 01:54:16,160
Cause you've just decided,
I don't believe that.

2874
01:54:16,161 --> 01:54:17,540
Now I'm going to believe I can change 
now.

2875
01:54:17,720 --> 01:54:20,330
Well I believe that people do change for
sure,

2876
01:54:20,420 --> 01:54:24,050
but none of their ideas is all like a,
it's not like a conscious choice to say,

2877
01:54:24,051 --> 01:54:24,771
you know what,
one day,

2878
01:54:24,771 --> 01:54:26,480
I mean I'm an atheist so one day I'm 
going to be like,

2879
01:54:26,960 --> 01:54:28,720
actually yeah,
I'm going to choose to believe in God.

2880
01:54:28,720 --> 01:54:29,840
Do you either believe or you don't 
believe in?

2881
01:54:29,870 --> 01:54:32,780
I don't think it's a choice.
Well I could see what you're saying,

2882
01:54:32,810 --> 01:54:37,810
but I think that when you're,
when you're going over the possibilities

2883
01:54:38,301 --> 01:54:39,134
of any subject in your mind you are,
you're influenced by a host of factors 

2884
01:54:44,720 --> 01:54:46,400
as well.
How you physically feel,

2885
01:54:46,700 --> 01:54:48,140
where you are in your life,
what,

2886
01:54:48,141 --> 01:54:50,420
what kind of relationship you have with 
your family,

2887
01:54:50,570 --> 01:54:53,240
like where your job is right now.
Like where are you?

2888
01:54:53,510 --> 01:54:54,343
I know a lot of people that hit the 
fucking bottom and then all of a sudden 

2889
01:54:56,721 --> 01:54:58,730
they became religious.
Do you think that that's a,

2890
01:54:58,790 --> 01:55:00,410
it's not a coincidence.
No.

2891
01:55:00,411 --> 01:55:01,244
It's like at that stage in your life you
needed to believe something and that 

2892
01:55:04,641 --> 01:55:06,830
helped you and helped you to believe 
that thing.

2893
01:55:06,890 --> 01:55:08,240
And maybe,
I mean,

2894
01:55:08,241 --> 01:55:09,074
how many dudes find Jesus where they're 
getting their dick sucked and the 

2895
01:55:10,851 --> 01:55:11,420
Jacuzzi.

2896
01:55:11,420 --> 01:55:12,253
Yeah,
exactly.

2897
01:55:12,380 --> 01:55:14,060
That's probably pretty low.
Yeah.

2898
01:55:14,090 --> 01:55:14,923
Right?
Yeah.

2899
01:55:14,980 --> 01:55:16,850
Yeah.
Unless it's like really bad blow job and

2900
01:55:16,851 --> 01:55:21,620
you just feel sad and you actually could
cause terrible at everywhere.

2901
01:55:21,640 --> 01:55:24,740
Anytime Jesus help me,
help me,

2902
01:55:24,741 --> 01:55:26,280
Jesus.
But you know,

2903
01:55:26,390 --> 01:55:27,223
people find,
they find love and happiness in weird 

2904
01:55:30,711 --> 01:55:33,350
places.
They find depression weird places.

2905
01:55:33,351 --> 01:55:34,184
So it's really a lot of like what you 
believe depends on where you're at in 

2906
01:55:36,801 --> 01:55:40,310
your life.
It can very well be influenced where you

2907
01:55:40,311 --> 01:55:44,280
go one way or the other.
And then once someone has an opinion,

2908
01:55:44,430 --> 01:55:46,860
whether it's God is real,
our God is fake,

2909
01:55:47,250 --> 01:55:52,250
they fucking fight that to the death.
Like that is their stance and they can't

2910
01:55:53,251 --> 01:55:54,840
change it.
They can't move it around.

2911
01:55:54,841 --> 01:55:55,674
And if you do,
you're off flip flopper if he didn't 

2912
01:55:57,271 --> 01:55:59,490
resign yourself into it,
then you can be reasoned out to it.

2913
01:55:59,850 --> 01:56:00,630
It's true.

2914
01:56:00,630 --> 01:56:01,463
Well that term flip flopper so fight,
it's so stupid because it's a more 

2915
01:56:05,401 --> 01:56:09,900
chronic political term and really only 
existed because politicians did not have

2916
01:56:09,901 --> 01:56:13,050
a forum to defend the evolution of their
ideas before.

2917
01:56:13,230 --> 01:56:16,380
Now they can go online.
Bernie Sanders as a fucking podcast,

2918
01:56:16,381 --> 01:56:17,370
you know,
now let's see.

2919
01:56:17,380 --> 01:56:18,950
Yeah,
he does listen to,

2920
01:56:18,951 --> 01:56:23,130
they can go on youtube or facebook.
They don't need to be in some sort of a,

2921
01:56:23,131 --> 01:56:24,170
um,
you know,

2922
01:56:24,210 --> 01:56:27,830
political forum,
some sort of a formal debate.

2923
01:56:28,140 --> 01:56:28,710
Yeah,
they don't,

2924
01:56:28,710 --> 01:56:30,150
they can just talk about their idea was 
like,

2925
01:56:30,151 --> 01:56:32,970
this is what I used to believe and this 
is why I changed my mind.

2926
01:56:32,971 --> 01:56:35,610
And they could do that over the course 
of an hour and a youtube video.

2927
01:56:35,790 --> 01:56:39,690
And it's clearly as the mind could 
decipher,

2928
01:56:40,570 --> 01:56:43,380
state their opinions on things,
but because people couldn't in the past,

2929
01:56:43,381 --> 01:56:47,220
like he used to be tough on crime,
now he's a flip flopper yeah,

2930
01:56:47,221 --> 01:56:48,180
you'll politics,
you know,

2931
01:56:48,181 --> 01:56:49,920
it might not be what happened.

2932
01:56:49,920 --> 01:56:50,753
He might used to be tough on crime,
but then he was given evidence of 

2933
01:56:53,551 --> 01:56:56,940
systematic racism that he realized how 
corrupt the police department is.

2934
01:56:56,941 --> 01:56:57,774
And then he realized that they have 
mandated quotas where they have to 

2935
01:57:00,151 --> 01:57:02,670
arrest a certain amount of people and 
this is probably the best place to do it

2936
01:57:02,820 --> 01:57:05,400
because those people don't have the 
money for legal representation and like,

2937
01:57:06,240 --> 01:57:09,720
so that's why my opinion evolve.
But you couldn't do that in the past.

2938
01:57:09,810 --> 01:57:12,000
So someone would just call you a flip 
flopper yeah,

2939
01:57:12,120 --> 01:57:14,850
the Internet has changed everything and 
for the better,

2940
01:57:14,970 --> 01:57:16,530
by a long shot,
I mean like we,

2941
01:57:16,531 --> 01:57:17,364
by the way,
this is not discrediting real flip 

2942
01:57:18,181 --> 01:57:19,014
flopping.
Right.

2943
01:57:19,320 --> 01:57:20,460
Obviously if something,
if someone,

2944
01:57:20,461 --> 01:57:21,630
if someone's,
you know,

2945
01:57:21,631 --> 01:57:22,464
it doesn't really hold a position and 
they're just doing it because it's a 

2946
01:57:24,151 --> 01:57:25,650
popular thing to do.
Like Hillary Clinton,

2947
01:57:25,651 --> 01:57:26,130
for example.

2948
01:57:26,130 --> 01:57:29,010
Perfect example.
Clinton and trump own gay marriage.

2949
01:57:29,280 --> 01:57:30,300
Yeah.
That's the best.

2950
01:57:30,870 --> 01:57:33,270
Trump has been consistent on that for 
decades now.

2951
01:57:33,480 --> 01:57:34,313
Hillary Clinton 2008 was like,
well I believe it's men and a woman 

2952
01:57:36,390 --> 01:57:40,560
until 2013 it wasn't until 2013 she 
finally came clean and when,

2953
01:57:40,561 --> 01:57:41,850
when?
When gay marriage,

2954
01:57:41,880 --> 01:57:44,310
right.
I didn't even know that there's not 2017

2955
01:57:44,430 --> 01:57:45,263
I believe that in this video of her from
2013 in fact saying that marriage is 

2956
01:57:48,751 --> 01:57:50,370
between a man and a woman.
Of course she would.

2957
01:57:50,670 --> 01:57:52,070
And then suddenly,
oh no,

2958
01:57:52,530 --> 01:57:54,000
you've got to change the position that,
and she's like,

2959
01:57:55,480 --> 01:57:56,131
yeah,
whatever.

2960
01:57:56,131 --> 01:57:57,480
I didn't give a shit cause I'm Hillary 
Clinton.

2961
01:57:57,481 --> 01:57:58,740
I'm here for the money.
Yes.

2962
01:57:58,741 --> 01:57:59,371
You know,
I'm here.

2963
01:57:59,371 --> 01:58:00,720
I'm a careerist.
I'm,

2964
01:58:01,090 --> 01:58:01,923
I'm going to be the first woman 
president because I have to fuck Bill 

2965
01:58:04,680 --> 01:58:05,250
Clinton.
All right.

2966
01:58:05,250 --> 01:58:08,850
I would love to read what the crazy shit
she said to those bankers.

2967
01:58:08,850 --> 01:58:10,740
And those quarter million dollar 
speeches.

2968
01:58:11,010 --> 01:58:14,760
I would love to know the transcripts 
that she won't release.

2969
01:58:14,920 --> 01:58:16,490
New wiki leaks is released.
The of,

2970
01:58:16,770 --> 01:58:18,990
I did not know that.
Really?

2971
01:58:18,991 --> 01:58:19,850
You want to do this?
She goes,

2972
01:58:20,250 --> 01:58:21,570
oh dude,
she wants some crazy stuff.

2973
01:58:21,571 --> 01:58:26,250
Like she wants some,
this is a hemispheric open borders where

2974
01:58:26,520 --> 01:58:28,200
like one hemisphere is just,
you know,

2975
01:58:28,201 --> 01:58:29,034
free and open and another one is free 
and open and t to eventually get like a 

2976
01:58:32,650 --> 01:58:36,020
united globalized world.
And you know the Anderson,

2977
01:58:36,030 --> 01:58:37,260
there's loads of stuff in there that's 
just,

2978
01:58:37,261 --> 01:58:39,840
and she's saying how she holds a public.
The bankers,

2979
01:58:39,910 --> 01:58:43,330
she said that in the speech that she 
holds a public and a private position.

2980
01:58:43,390 --> 01:58:44,061
Yeah.
Okay.

2981
01:58:44,061 --> 01:58:45,340
I did not know that.
They can't,

2982
01:58:45,341 --> 01:58:49,750
that Bernie Sanders ever discussed that 
it was pretty since he's,

2983
01:58:50,320 --> 01:58:52,280
I don't know.
He's done.

2984
01:58:52,380 --> 01:58:53,740
No,
don't even a cook.

2985
01:58:53,980 --> 01:58:55,780
Oh No.
He's not considered Bernie Sanders.

2986
01:58:55,780 --> 01:58:58,110
Seems like a very nice man,
but he's a cook.

2987
01:58:58,270 --> 01:58:59,110
He's a bit of,
well,

2988
01:58:59,260 --> 01:59:01,090
I mean you saw black lives matter take 
over stage,

2989
01:59:01,091 --> 01:59:02,050
right?
Oh yeah,

2990
01:59:02,051 --> 01:59:04,300
I did.
That was sad.

2991
01:59:04,330 --> 01:59:06,380
It was fucking sad.
Bernie a man.

2992
01:59:06,400 --> 01:59:07,233
These little bullies have got no right 
to your platform and they're literally 

2993
01:59:08,981 --> 01:59:11,410
squeezing him.
We are being reasonable screaming in his

2994
01:59:11,411 --> 01:59:12,244
face.
I Bernie.

2995
01:59:12,470 --> 01:59:15,100
Yeah.
As soon as some of the minus side,

2996
01:59:15,550 --> 01:59:17,530
it doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter.

2997
01:59:17,560 --> 01:59:19,580
That lost me.
I didn't approve of I,

2998
01:59:19,650 --> 01:59:20,201
you know,
I was,

2999
01:59:20,201 --> 01:59:21,520
I was,
I was at that point,

3000
01:59:21,521 --> 01:59:22,900
a supporter of Bernie.
I like Bernie.

3001
01:59:23,470 --> 01:59:24,190
I thought,
okay,

3002
01:59:24,190 --> 01:59:26,580
he's maybe maybe a little further left.
I'd be like,

3003
01:59:26,950 --> 01:59:27,520
I'd have to.
Good.

3004
01:59:27,520 --> 01:59:31,660
He took a chance and having them go up 
there and then I liked that though.

3005
01:59:31,870 --> 01:59:33,370
I liked it.
He took the chance to let them,

3006
01:59:33,371 --> 01:59:34,204
todd and I,
I don't think they should be able to do 

3007
01:59:36,311 --> 01:59:37,144
it,
but I think it does give you a sense of 

3008
01:59:38,831 --> 01:59:40,840
who he is that he's like,
all right,

3009
01:59:40,900 --> 01:59:42,010
tell me what you want.

3010
01:59:42,220 --> 01:59:44,830
Tell me what you're looking at.
Then he's just like standing at the side

3011
01:59:44,840 --> 01:59:46,130
like,
Tony,

3012
01:59:46,390 --> 01:59:47,260
you're not a leader.
Me.

3013
01:59:47,440 --> 01:59:48,610
Well,
if he moves his hands there.

3014
01:59:48,611 --> 01:59:49,760
Microaggression.
Exactly.

3015
01:59:49,810 --> 01:59:50,710
We've learned that.
Not,

3016
01:59:51,160 --> 01:59:53,170
you know,
you should've had your boundaries.

3017
01:59:53,200 --> 01:59:54,910
I mean,
you didn't immediately capitulate,

3018
01:59:55,260 --> 01:59:57,460
so that was your boundaries.
You didn't stick to it.

3019
01:59:57,700 --> 01:59:58,570
Ah,
that's a good point.

3020
01:59:58,600 --> 01:59:59,860
You should,
you should've said,

3021
01:59:59,861 --> 02:00:00,940
listen,
no,

3022
02:00:01,240 --> 02:00:02,073
I'm going to call security.
You're going to be a school to the way 

3023
02:00:03,880 --> 02:00:04,713
maybe we could discuss it in future.
If someone comes up to you and stuff 

3024
02:00:07,310 --> 02:00:09,520
screeching your face that they're being 
reasonable.

3025
02:00:09,760 --> 02:00:14,530
You draw the line and you stick to it.
You do not let that person bully you out

3026
02:00:14,531 --> 02:00:16,210
of your podium.
It's yours,

3027
02:00:16,240 --> 02:00:17,860
not theirs.
They've got no right to it.

3028
02:00:18,070 --> 02:00:18,903
Tell them to get fucked.
He's being investigated now they're 

3029
02:00:22,511 --> 02:00:24,280
going after I heard,
but I haven't looked into it.

3030
02:00:24,490 --> 02:00:29,380
Financial dealings with his wife and him
and a small university where,

3031
02:00:29,381 --> 02:00:30,214
uh,
she made some decisions that ultimately 

3032
02:00:32,981 --> 02:00:37,360
didn't pan out financially and it caused
the university to go under.

3033
02:00:37,530 --> 02:00:38,363
Oh Damn.
They acquired a bunch of new land and 

3034
02:00:40,331 --> 02:00:41,164
they were going to expand the university
and they got a lot of loans and they 

3035
02:00:43,791 --> 02:00:45,340
started construction,
all this jazz.

3036
02:00:45,730 --> 02:00:47,980
And apparently it just wasn't 
sustainable.

3037
02:00:48,190 --> 02:00:49,650
And so now,
um,

3038
02:00:49,810 --> 02:00:53,140
I think there's allegations,
which of course whenever something fails

3039
02:00:53,141 --> 02:00:53,974
like that,
there's allegations that someone ms 

3040
02:00:54,871 --> 02:00:55,704
handle something.
So they've been forced her to this 

3041
02:00:57,380 --> 02:00:59,380
lawyer dump.
Um,

3042
02:00:59,381 --> 02:01:01,810
I do not know it's been the news,
you know,

3043
02:01:01,811 --> 02:01:04,990
I haven't really deeply gone into the 
story,

3044
02:01:05,200 --> 02:01:06,280
but the,
the,

3045
02:01:06,520 --> 02:01:10,510
the basics of the story are she worked 
for this university.

3046
02:01:10,720 --> 02:01:14,560
She wanted it to expand.
They got spend a lot of money expanding.

3047
02:01:14,590 --> 02:01:19,410
It didn't work out so it doesn't sound 
on the face of it.

3048
02:01:19,410 --> 02:01:21,370
And like malfeasance was necessarily 
involved.

3049
02:01:21,700 --> 02:01:26,700
The worry is that he used his influence 
to make some certain things happen.

3050
02:01:27,310 --> 02:01:31,130
The allowed to take place perhaps while 
I,

3051
02:01:31,160 --> 02:01:33,850
that's the allegation I believe.
I still think Rome,

3052
02:01:33,851 --> 02:01:36,280
polk and wind to be honest.
He might,

3053
02:01:36,910 --> 02:01:37,631
he's old.
Yeah,

3054
02:01:37,631 --> 02:01:38,940
he's waiting to open.
He's way too old.

3055
02:01:38,960 --> 02:01:40,770
They're always talking about if you're a
politician.

3056
02:01:40,771 --> 02:01:43,850
So old days because it takes that long 
for trust.

3057
02:01:43,851 --> 02:01:45,020
You,
it's sad though,

3058
02:01:45,740 --> 02:01:46,573
isn't there like some guy in his forties
he's basically saying the same thing as 

3059
02:01:48,561 --> 02:01:52,130
Bernie Sanders who hasn't liked any 
stills still gets bonners.

3060
02:01:52,131 --> 02:01:53,850
We don't trust him.
Great.

3061
02:01:54,860 --> 02:01:55,720
He gives a shit.
We fuck.

3062
02:01:55,721 --> 02:01:56,870
Is this the thing that Bill Clinton,
man,

3063
02:01:56,871 --> 02:01:59,660
it really pissed me off site.
I don't think shit people do.

3064
02:01:59,690 --> 02:02:00,523
It's weird if it's because they can find
out about it and they couldn't find out 

3065
02:02:03,261 --> 02:02:04,094
about it before.

3066
02:02:04,280 --> 02:02:05,113
So you got a guy like jfk was a total 
pussy hound who people revere is a 

3067
02:02:08,241 --> 02:02:09,074
great,
great,

3068
02:02:09,860 --> 02:02:10,820
yeah,
we'll push the hand.

3069
02:02:10,850 --> 02:02:12,380
Supposedly.
Yeah,

3070
02:02:12,381 --> 02:02:15,550
he was smoking hot fire.
Who called?

3071
02:02:15,590 --> 02:02:20,440
Who knows the thing like why do we care 
under a question?

3072
02:02:20,470 --> 02:02:21,800
And that's a problem with him and his 
wife.

3073
02:02:21,801 --> 02:02:23,000
You know,
that's nothing to do with writing,

3074
02:02:23,390 --> 02:02:24,380
you know?
And it doesn't surprise me.

3075
02:02:24,381 --> 02:02:27,200
It's all great.
Men always get women flinging themselves

3076
02:02:27,290 --> 02:02:29,330
at them and okay,
there are many human,

3077
02:02:29,331 --> 02:02:31,490
if you've got some really attractive 
woman flinging herself out,

3078
02:02:31,491 --> 02:02:33,830
you're going to go and we can just,
nothing's going to go wrong.

3079
02:02:33,831 --> 02:02:35,010
And that'll be great.
No one died.

3080
02:02:35,660 --> 02:02:37,070
No fucking surprise.
Right.

3081
02:02:37,250 --> 02:02:38,750
It's not a judgment on their character 
either.

3082
02:02:38,751 --> 02:02:40,970
That's just them being a bit weak in the
moment,

3083
02:02:41,330 --> 02:02:41,900
you know?
I know.

3084
02:02:41,900 --> 02:02:43,670
They know it's wrong.
They know they shouldn't have done it.

3085
02:02:44,140 --> 02:02:44,901
All right,
well,

3086
02:02:44,901 --> 02:02:45,734
the culture is very,
very different and the culture of 

3087
02:02:48,081 --> 02:02:48,914
politics was very different back then.
People knew about the president's 

3088
02:02:52,671 --> 02:02:54,050
affairs.
Like what was that?

3089
02:02:54,051 --> 02:02:56,030
Uh,
who is the president that had polio?

3090
02:02:56,790 --> 02:02:57,623
Uh,
who's the president had polio and other 

3091
02:02:59,530 --> 02:03:00,770
one.
You had a wheelchair.

3092
02:03:01,790 --> 02:03:03,830
What does it,
was it Roosevelt?

3093
02:03:04,410 --> 02:03:06,130
He is he the guy who he's got the 
little,

3094
02:03:06,131 --> 02:03:10,460
little round glasses and smile.
It was a roosevelt had polio.

3095
02:03:10,490 --> 02:03:12,050
I'd have to look it up.
Um,

3096
02:03:12,110 --> 02:03:12,920
anyway.
Yeah,

3097
02:03:12,920 --> 02:03:13,753
he was,
yeah.

3098
02:03:13,790 --> 02:03:15,200
Teddy Franklin,
Franklin,

3099
02:03:15,380 --> 02:03:17,110
Franklin Delano Roosevelt.
Um,

3100
02:03:17,450 --> 02:03:18,283
he had polio and um,
the press knew it and they hid it from 

3101
02:03:21,320 --> 02:03:22,550
everybody.
They just,

3102
02:03:22,551 --> 02:03:23,750
uh,
no one.

3103
02:03:23,810 --> 02:03:24,531
Yeah,
it's weird,

3104
02:03:24,531 --> 02:03:25,310
isn't it?
Yeah.

3105
02:03:25,310 --> 02:03:26,143
I mean that was the thing with JFK.
That was the thing of Lyndon Johnson 

3106
02:03:28,221 --> 02:03:30,620
famously held a press conference while 
he was taking a shit.

3107
02:03:31,540 --> 02:03:34,910
He was literally taking a shit with the 
door open in the stall when he's talking

3108
02:03:34,911 --> 02:03:37,910
to the press because there was like 
boundaries,

3109
02:03:37,940 --> 02:03:39,350
you know,
they couldn't say,

3110
02:03:39,360 --> 02:03:40,360
it's kind of code of honor.

3111
02:03:40,510 --> 02:03:41,343
Yeah.
This guy was taking a horrible student 

3112
02:03:42,161 --> 02:03:42,994
and Shit.
No,

3113
02:03:43,080 --> 02:03:43,913
no,
no.

3114
02:03:44,570 --> 02:03:47,150
Well,
I also think that once Watergate broke,

3115
02:03:47,390 --> 02:03:48,920
once you realize that,
hey,

3116
02:03:48,921 --> 02:03:51,860
it's pretty obvious this president is a 
fucking liar.

3117
02:03:51,861 --> 02:03:55,400
And a crook and we need,
if we have any responsibility,

3118
02:03:55,640 --> 02:03:56,980
we need to expose this.
Well,

3119
02:03:56,990 --> 02:03:59,360
once you expose that man,
you open up that door.

3120
02:03:59,390 --> 02:04:00,223
Whoa.
People find out the genie's out of the 

3121
02:04:01,941 --> 02:04:04,100
bottle and then they want to know 
everything you'd want to know.

3122
02:04:04,160 --> 02:04:04,993
As soon as it becomes permissible,
whether they're saying it's up to 

3123
02:04:06,681 --> 02:04:07,490
people,
not to camp,

3124
02:04:07,490 --> 02:04:08,870
it's up to people to understand that 
look,

3125
02:04:09,430 --> 02:04:10,263
at the end of the day,
you are the person who is making the 

3126
02:04:11,511 --> 02:04:12,344
difference and it's a small difference.
But if we all agree that we're all 

3127
02:04:14,180 --> 02:04:15,440
making small difference than when you're
working,

3128
02:04:15,770 --> 02:04:18,050
I'm going to act in a way that I find 
personally responsible.

3129
02:04:18,051 --> 02:04:18,711
If we will say,
right,

3130
02:04:18,711 --> 02:04:20,810
well we're going to act in ways that we 
fund pestering responsible,

3131
02:04:21,050 --> 02:04:21,883
they'll just end up with the best of 
worlds without having to change 

3132
02:04:23,571 --> 02:04:24,404
anything,
right?

3133
02:04:24,460 --> 02:04:26,330
Yeah.
No heads.

3134
02:04:26,360 --> 02:04:29,570
Don't you think that today is probably 
harder than ever the to manage like what

3135
02:04:29,571 --> 02:04:30,920
you're paying attention to and what 
you're not?

3136
02:04:31,010 --> 02:04:31,641
Oh yeah,
we'll,

3137
02:04:31,641 --> 02:04:32,001
we'll,
if,

3138
02:04:32,001 --> 02:04:32,834
yeah.
If you're thinking about like fake news 

3139
02:04:33,381 --> 02:04:36,000
and like pots and I mean that,
that's a real problem.

3140
02:04:36,001 --> 02:04:38,040
The social media is like,
there've been

3141
02:04:38,040 --> 02:04:39,540
studies done that showed like,
and it's,

3142
02:04:39,541 --> 02:04:42,120
it's more on the left,
but it's also very much on the right,

3143
02:04:42,121 --> 02:04:42,650
you know,
like,

3144
02:04:42,650 --> 02:04:44,070
you know,
they're like 70,

3145
02:04:44,130 --> 02:04:45,370
60 or something like that,
you know,

3146
02:04:45,390 --> 02:04:48,060
but it's slightly more on the left where
people just essentially,

3147
02:04:48,290 --> 02:04:51,440
essentially get one political viewpoint.
And so that the,

3148
02:04:51,441 --> 02:04:52,274
the social media is just a stream of 
content that's all telling you the same 

3149
02:04:55,381 --> 02:04:56,214
thing.
What was the story that just came out 

3150
02:04:58,080 --> 02:05:01,860
about a fake news story that costs some 
company,

3151
02:05:02,220 --> 02:05:06,690
some untold millions of dollars.
Might've been even been,

3152
02:05:06,691 --> 02:05:09,540
they might've even said be $1 billion in
stock.

3153
02:05:09,930 --> 02:05:12,720
And it just came out today like that 
sound that,

3154
02:05:12,760 --> 02:05:16,440
uh,
a company was extremely devalued because

3155
02:05:16,441 --> 02:05:18,900
of a fake news story that is a danger.
Yeah.

3156
02:05:18,930 --> 02:05:20,040
Oh,
it's a big danger.

3157
02:05:20,190 --> 02:05:21,023
Especially if you trade in the stock 
market and then all of a sudden it 

3158
02:05:23,341 --> 02:05:24,174
causes a cascade of panic and people 
just start dumping their stock and 

3159
02:05:26,461 --> 02:05:27,060
you're fucked.

3160
02:05:27,060 --> 02:05:28,950
It's all turns colby face.
So,

3161
02:05:29,280 --> 02:05:30,113
I mean,
the idea would be that it would balance 

3162
02:05:30,991 --> 02:05:33,240
out eventually,
but if it was a fragile company,

3163
02:05:33,390 --> 02:05:35,940
who knows what this will damage that 
could have done to them.

3164
02:05:36,510 --> 02:05:39,540
Did you find it?
It's a really recent news story.

3165
02:05:39,570 --> 02:05:42,360
It just came out like this,
the today or yesterday.

3166
02:05:42,361 --> 02:05:44,670
It's the flip side of like being able to
hold people accountable.

3167
02:05:44,700 --> 02:05:46,120
You know,
it's it.

3168
02:05:46,230 --> 02:05:47,063
Yeah.
You can't hold,

3169
02:05:47,070 --> 02:05:49,290
the Internet's fantastic in social media
is fantastic.

3170
02:05:49,320 --> 02:05:50,310
Youtube,
fantastic.

3171
02:05:50,580 --> 02:05:51,391
And you can,
I mean,

3172
02:05:51,391 --> 02:05:53,430
I think you could make real arguments 
that these things are now,

3173
02:05:53,431 --> 02:05:56,880
but like critical to free speech.
I agree.

3174
02:05:56,910 --> 02:05:59,940
I mean land and there should be like,
this should be understood,

3175
02:06:00,330 --> 02:06:01,163
but on the flip side,
someone could say something that's not 

3176
02:06:02,611 --> 02:06:03,840
true.
That's free speech.

3177
02:06:04,380 --> 02:06:05,081
Yeah.
Well that's,

3178
02:06:05,081 --> 02:06:05,914
it's unfortunate,
but it's amazing when you really think 

3179
02:06:08,461 --> 02:06:09,780
about it,
how rare it is.

3180
02:06:10,170 --> 02:06:12,090
I mean,
even though it's fairly common,

3181
02:06:12,091 --> 02:06:17,091
you're talking about 7 billion people.
Even phony happened once a day.

3182
02:06:17,730 --> 02:06:20,040
That's still only one thing a day.
That's nothing.

3183
02:06:20,250 --> 02:06:22,230
But I mean it is up to everyone.
I mean like the,

3184
02:06:22,231 --> 02:06:23,850
they'll probably have to educate kids in
school.

3185
02:06:23,910 --> 02:06:24,451
We need,
right?

3186
02:06:24,451 --> 02:06:25,830
When you see something going around the 
social media,

3187
02:06:25,831 --> 02:06:26,664
you're going to have to fact check it.
I think there's going to be much more 

3188
02:06:29,431 --> 02:06:33,210
sophisticated ways of understanding 
whether or not someone's being honest.

3189
02:06:33,480 --> 02:06:34,313
And I think what we're looking at now is
just like when people started reading 

3190
02:06:38,581 --> 02:06:39,414
books that were written,
they never imagined that someone was 

3191
02:06:41,671 --> 02:06:44,280
going to have a printing press.
And when people had a printing press,

3192
02:06:44,281 --> 02:06:45,114
no one was ever going to imagine that 
you're going to put that on the 

3193
02:06:46,531 --> 02:06:47,364
Internet.
So I think there's probably something 

3194
02:06:48,811 --> 02:06:49,644
around the band right now for us that 
it's going to radically change the 

3195
02:06:53,521 --> 02:06:56,700
factual interpretation of information.

3196
02:06:57,000 --> 02:06:59,520
Like you're going to know what's real 
and what's not.

3197
02:06:59,521 --> 02:07:02,910
And it's probably going to be something 
that you're not even going to understand

3198
02:07:02,911 --> 02:07:06,330
what it's about now.
Like that as technology evolves and it's

3199
02:07:06,450 --> 02:07:08,370
bizarre,
an exponential way,

3200
02:07:08,580 --> 02:07:12,870
they're going to reach some new critical
way of distributing information and then

3201
02:07:12,871 --> 02:07:13,704
things are going to get very strange.
Just the way they're strange now where 

3202
02:07:16,621 --> 02:07:20,790
we have this radical new ability to put 
out content like you do or I do.

3203
02:07:20,820 --> 02:07:21,653
Yeah.
I think in the future there's going to 

3204
02:07:23,191 --> 02:07:24,024
be another change that's just as 
monumental and justice huge and it's 

3205
02:07:27,271 --> 02:07:30,000
probably going to deal with how we 
interface with that data.

3206
02:07:30,240 --> 02:07:31,780
Like some sort of uh,
uh,

3207
02:07:31,810 --> 02:07:36,400
but wearable thing or a mind thing where
you can recognize patterns

3208
02:07:36,400 --> 02:07:37,233
as being true or untrue.
Recognize humans is being honest or 

3209
02:07:41,381 --> 02:07:43,030
dishonest.
Like you're going to be able to see,

3210
02:07:43,980 --> 02:07:45,070
you're going to find it,
man.

3211
02:07:45,071 --> 02:07:45,940
You could,
we're going to get to,

3212
02:07:46,030 --> 02:07:46,863
you know what people are really worried 
about the lack of privacy now I feel 

3213
02:07:51,431 --> 02:07:54,820
like that is just step one,
tell this ultimate,

3214
02:07:54,821 --> 02:07:59,210
very bizarre symbiotic relationship 
we're going to have with each other and,

3215
02:07:59,211 --> 02:08:00,044
and technology where we're going to beat
inside each other's heads in a very 

3216
02:08:03,101 --> 02:08:04,360
simple way.
It comes back.

3217
02:08:04,361 --> 02:08:05,680
It's kind of what I was saying about 
racism.

3218
02:08:05,710 --> 02:08:06,543
Uh,
let me the sjws and like the evergreen 

3219
02:08:08,891 --> 02:08:10,120
college students king,
Hey,

3220
02:08:10,121 --> 02:08:11,320
if you do this,
you're a racist.

3221
02:08:11,321 --> 02:08:12,210
I mentioned the SCA.
Yeah,

3222
02:08:12,270 --> 02:08:13,103
I'm a racist.
They'll just say it and it can then be 

3223
02:08:14,741 --> 02:08:14,891
like,
yeah,

3224
02:08:14,891 --> 02:08:15,740
but you're a racing them.
But yeah,

3225
02:08:15,741 --> 02:08:17,500
I know what's next.
And they'll be like,

3226
02:08:17,530 --> 02:08:18,363
yeah,
but you're supposed to do something 

3227
02:08:18,701 --> 02:08:20,110
because otherwise I'll call you a 
racist.

3228
02:08:20,110 --> 02:08:20,943
Yeah,
cal just be a racist then it doesn't 

3229
02:08:22,631 --> 02:08:24,230
mean anything anymore.
Final racing,

3230
02:08:24,870 --> 02:08:26,920
all you have to get consent to give that
power.

3231
02:08:27,340 --> 02:08:28,710
And if I don't consent,
like you know,

3232
02:08:28,720 --> 02:08:31,870
if you like what was a key I can wold or
whatever.

3233
02:08:31,900 --> 02:08:35,110
Who would the tentacle porn.
He should've just done it.

3234
02:08:35,320 --> 02:08:36,101
But yeah,
fuck you.

3235
02:08:36,101 --> 02:08:39,670
You probably watched him shit stuff too.
But they say,

3236
02:08:39,671 --> 02:08:40,610
oh my God,
he looks at tens,

3237
02:08:40,630 --> 02:08:41,291
couple and he's like,
yeah.

3238
02:08:41,291 --> 02:08:42,820
And you look at wall,
go on,

3239
02:08:42,821 --> 02:08:44,930
tell me what you'll pull them.
Watching habits are gone.

3240
02:08:44,940 --> 02:08:45,773
And tell me about your puritan 
puritanical porn watching you just 

3241
02:08:47,831 --> 02:08:51,400
watched two people in missionary for 20 
minutes and then that gets you off.

3242
02:08:51,401 --> 02:08:52,234
Does it shut up?
Even if it doesn't get you off and you 

3243
02:08:54,871 --> 02:08:56,070
can watch it,
you know,

3244
02:08:56,071 --> 02:08:57,790
like what if he just like,
what the fuck?

3245
02:08:58,180 --> 02:09:00,830
Like if you looked through my youtube 
lists or the,

3246
02:09:00,831 --> 02:09:01,920
you looked at my,
uh,

3247
02:09:02,050 --> 02:09:03,730
history online,
you'd be like,

3248
02:09:03,800 --> 02:09:04,660
is that something you like?

3249
02:09:05,100 --> 02:09:06,120
No,
I was gonna to it.

3250
02:09:06,190 --> 02:09:07,570
The fuck it,
let's see what it was.

3251
02:09:07,571 --> 02:09:09,400
Yeah.
I don't like car accidents,

3252
02:09:09,700 --> 02:09:10,533
but I watched that motorcycle kicked 
that car and the car spins out and hits 

3253
02:09:13,871 --> 02:09:16,090
the barrier.
Then flips that other car.

3254
02:09:16,450 --> 02:09:17,200
Yeah,
I saw it.

3255
02:09:17,200 --> 02:09:18,940
Everybody saw it.
Does it mean I liked it?

3256
02:09:19,060 --> 02:09:19,780
No,
ain't no,

3257
02:09:19,780 --> 02:09:23,310
but you know,
a lot of it's technical.

3258
02:09:23,940 --> 02:09:24,773
Yeah.
Well there's something about that makes 

3259
02:09:25,511 --> 02:09:27,130
me skeptical.
Wow.

3260
02:09:27,220 --> 02:09:28,780
He should've just done and it is such a 
silly,

3261
02:09:28,810 --> 02:09:29,643
who is he?
I don't even know who you're talking 

3262
02:09:30,191 --> 02:09:31,980
about.
This guy like a mold.

3263
02:09:31,990 --> 02:09:32,980
I think it is.
Who is he?

3264
02:09:33,040 --> 02:09:33,873
I didn't know this.
I think he's a right wing journalist or 

3265
02:09:34,961 --> 02:09:35,700
something.
I don't.

3266
02:09:35,700 --> 02:09:36,610
Oh,
nick caught him.

3267
02:09:36,700 --> 02:09:38,140
Ended up tentacle porn.
Does that wouldn't,

3268
02:09:38,300 --> 02:09:39,880
I guess it was in his search history or 
something.

3269
02:09:39,881 --> 02:09:42,740
Did you find that story about,
well,

3270
02:09:42,780 --> 02:09:45,940
there's someone that I know,
I know I have that devalued story.

3271
02:09:45,940 --> 02:09:48,190
Like someone said,
it was definitely something,

3272
02:09:48,191 --> 02:09:49,380
but uh,
but it didn't not,

3273
02:09:49,390 --> 02:09:50,310
you know,
but the thing is this,

3274
02:09:50,311 --> 02:09:51,144
this is the point in like if we got into
a future where literally everyone's 

3275
02:09:52,421 --> 02:09:53,254
going to know everything about everyone,
then nothing's really going to matter 

3276
02:09:55,061 --> 02:09:56,110
about any person.
I mean,

3277
02:09:56,111 --> 02:09:56,741
they seem like,
well,

3278
02:09:56,741 --> 02:09:57,570
yeah,
everyone does this,

3279
02:09:57,570 --> 02:09:58,040
you know,
you know,

3280
02:09:58,040 --> 02:10:01,030
you know exactly who does this.
So it's not gonna be shameful.

3281
02:10:01,060 --> 02:10:02,620
Nothing to be shameful,
nothing and be shocking.

3282
02:10:02,950 --> 02:10:04,900
Everyone would just know.
Everyone knows everything about everyone

3283
02:10:04,901 --> 02:10:06,430
all the time.
Yeah.

3284
02:10:06,431 --> 02:10:07,750
That's the real worry.
Right.

3285
02:10:07,810 --> 02:10:09,970
And they were going to become okay here.
Right here.

3286
02:10:10,630 --> 02:10:12,070
Okay.
The fake news.

3287
02:10:12,071 --> 02:10:13,090
Here it is.
I'll tell you,

3288
02:10:13,091 --> 02:10:14,290
I found it so easy,
Jamie.

3289
02:10:14,530 --> 02:10:17,220
So sad at your skills.
Um,

3290
02:10:17,260 --> 02:10:22,260
it says fake news of fatal car crash 
wiped out 4 billion in,

3291
02:10:24,160 --> 02:10:27,470
here's the company,
e three m a.

3292
02:10:27,580 --> 02:10:29,800
E.
T.

3293
02:10:29,800 --> 02:10:30,010
H.
No,

3294
02:10:30,010 --> 02:10:32,160
that's Bitcoin coin.
That's like a cryptocurrency.

3295
02:10:32,210 --> 02:10:33,043
Uh,
that's,

3296
02:10:33,110 --> 02:10:33,943
you didn't find it.
Yeah,

3297
02:10:34,100 --> 02:10:35,720
I didn't know what that was.
That's a new one.

3298
02:10:35,900 --> 02:10:37,490
Yeah.
Oh God.

3299
02:10:37,520 --> 02:10:38,870
Okay.
So fake news of fatal.

3300
02:10:38,900 --> 02:10:41,270
It's on courts.
Um,

3301
02:10:41,300 --> 02:10:42,860
qz.com
yeah.

3302
02:10:43,610 --> 02:10:47,030
Wiped out that $4 billion in their 
market value yesterday.

3303
02:10:48,110 --> 02:10:48,943
How the fuck they at $4 billion in 
market value of a Crypto coin that I've 

3304
02:10:51,381 --> 02:10:53,000
never even heard of.
No idea.

3305
02:10:53,220 --> 02:10:54,540
So cryptic.
I'd see what x.

3306
02:10:54,770 --> 02:10:55,603
So that's,
I mean it's still I guess as legitimate 

3307
02:10:58,640 --> 02:11:02,660
as stock Jesus Christ and if there's $4 
billion in value to it,

3308
02:11:02,661 --> 02:11:04,590
that's as legitimate as a company about 
it.

3309
02:11:04,740 --> 02:11:09,740
Some legitimacy point being that a fake 
news story wiped out the value of it,

3310
02:11:10,041 --> 02:11:12,650
but maybe now's the time to buy.
All right.

3311
02:11:12,710 --> 02:11:13,543
Well yeah,
if it's got no value and it's probably 

3312
02:11:14,481 --> 02:11:17,640
going to go back up cause this wasn't a 
real thing about it again in ground pool

3313
02:11:17,960 --> 02:11:19,280
dive in,
take a chance.

3314
02:11:19,281 --> 02:11:22,730
I didn't make it well that you got it.

3315
02:11:22,910 --> 02:11:26,180
What does it take story about the guy 
that created it died in a car crash.

3316
02:11:26,330 --> 02:11:27,163
Oh everybody panel.
Then everyone panicked because the 

3317
02:11:29,781 --> 02:11:30,351
creator,
God,

3318
02:11:30,351 --> 02:11:34,160
it's controlling the money in the market
of it supposedly died.

3319
02:11:34,340 --> 02:11:36,010
Well that didn't happen.
Oh,

3320
02:11:36,011 --> 02:11:39,440
okay.
But still hot attack for him though.

3321
02:11:39,830 --> 02:11:40,341
Oh,
by the way,

3322
02:11:40,341 --> 02:11:42,850
you'll stuff's going down $4 billion.
Watson.

3323
02:11:43,130 --> 02:11:43,840
I know,
right?

3324
02:11:43,840 --> 02:11:45,350
Can you even imagine the other weird 
part?

3325
02:11:45,351 --> 02:11:46,490
It's not stock.
It's a,

3326
02:11:46,890 --> 02:11:48,560
Oh,
what's the value of marketing?

3327
02:11:49,430 --> 02:11:52,160
That's another one of my favorite 
stories of the last year.

3328
02:11:52,400 --> 02:11:53,870
The Fan,
oh story.

3329
02:11:54,050 --> 02:11:54,883
That woman who was a pretending to be 
the news female Steve Jobs and she had 

3330
02:11:59,391 --> 02:12:00,224
the look,
so everybody went with it and she had 

3331
02:12:01,881 --> 02:12:04,910
this blood testing procedure that 
totally didn't work.

3332
02:12:04,911 --> 02:12:06,700
Didn't look into it.
It's a great story.

3333
02:12:07,070 --> 02:12:10,430
She was,
she was touted as being the next genius.

3334
02:12:10,460 --> 02:12:12,530
She dressed exactly like Steve Jobs.

3335
02:12:12,740 --> 02:12:13,573
She wore black turtlenecks and was 
really hilarious and she gave this 

3336
02:12:16,721 --> 02:12:19,550
speech to like women in something or 
another,

3337
02:12:19,790 --> 02:12:20,623
but the speech was so like jumbled and 
shitty and there's so much poverty of 

3338
02:12:26,391 --> 02:12:28,250
words in our sentences,
like the,

3339
02:12:28,350 --> 02:12:30,350
the content was just so bad.
I was like,

3340
02:12:30,351 --> 02:12:31,970
this is a genius.
Like,

3341
02:12:31,971 --> 02:12:32,804
maybe she's like super awkward and 
nervous and maybe she just didn't 

3342
02:12:35,600 --> 02:12:37,610
prepare this speech at all,
but no,

3343
02:12:37,760 --> 02:12:38,593
turns out choosing massive fraud things 
at massive fraud and her $34 billion 

3344
02:12:42,831 --> 02:12:43,664
company vanished.
So the company had a product that they 

3345
02:12:47,601 --> 02:12:48,434
were using where they were doing these 
blood tests and a whistle blower from 

3346
02:12:52,041 --> 02:12:53,450
inside the company said,
this person,

3347
02:12:53,480 --> 02:12:54,313
they're ignoring all the bad data.
They were ignoring all the failed tasks 

3348
02:12:57,321 --> 02:12:59,600
that they're pretending it's much more 
efficient than it is.

3349
02:12:59,950 --> 02:13:00,741
Right.
I'll do it.

3350
02:13:00,741 --> 02:13:01,970
Not only did,
did not work,

3351
02:13:02,090 --> 02:13:05,240
hundreds of thousands of people who took
these tests,

3352
02:13:05,280 --> 02:13:06,113
oh,
we're exposed to potential health 

3353
02:13:07,071 --> 02:13:08,330
threats because they thought,
well,

3354
02:13:08,331 --> 02:13:09,140
this is Heston.

3355
02:13:09,140 --> 02:13:11,120
They know what I know where my blood is 
now.

3356
02:13:11,121 --> 02:13:13,210
So you could have gone,
you know,

3357
02:13:13,211 --> 02:13:17,510
a more cautious or less cautious based 
on this or got treatment that you didn't

3358
02:13:17,511 --> 02:13:18,344
need based on this or didn't get 
treatment that you probably did need 

3359
02:13:21,320 --> 02:13:22,880
based on this.
So,

3360
02:13:23,010 --> 02:13:23,843
uh,
they imagined the kind of person who 

3361
02:13:24,651 --> 02:13:26,950
does that though.
She's standing there bullshitting.

3362
02:13:26,951 --> 02:13:30,410
I'm sociopath was at risk sociopath in,
in some sort of a way.

3363
02:13:30,450 --> 02:13:33,960
Um,
some or unless she was lied to too.

3364
02:13:34,170 --> 02:13:35,003
I mean,
who knows exactly what the actual story 

3365
02:13:36,601 --> 02:13:38,400
is you've got.
But the,

3366
02:13:38,430 --> 02:13:39,780
the,
the whistleblower saying no,

3367
02:13:39,781 --> 02:13:42,030
she's absolutely aware of it.
And so now she's,

3368
02:13:42,270 --> 02:13:47,270
she went from being like the number one 
self made female entrepreneur ever where

3369
02:13:48,001 --> 02:13:53,001
she was worth like $34 billion or 
something crazy to massive debt.

3370
02:13:53,130 --> 02:13:55,650
Now our company is worth nothing.
It doesn't work.

3371
02:13:55,651 --> 02:13:59,580
So she fired a shit load of people and 
the company still exists as an entity,

3372
02:13:59,581 --> 02:14:00,414
but it's,
it's like one of those really tortured 

3373
02:14:01,621 --> 02:14:01,920
things.

3374
02:14:01,920 --> 02:14:04,470
There's lawsuits are flying around left 
and right now,

3375
02:14:04,920 --> 02:14:07,950
but the whole story is a cautionary tale
and like what,

3376
02:14:08,070 --> 02:14:10,860
what we're looking for,
we're looking for this thing,

3377
02:14:10,861 --> 02:14:12,620
this new image.
You know,

3378
02:14:12,630 --> 02:14:14,490
here's this woman,
she's fitting the part.

3379
02:14:14,610 --> 02:14:18,080
She's got a black turtleneck on.
She con artist came along and played,

3380
02:14:18,081 --> 02:14:20,850
you dropped out of college at 19 to 
start this business.

3381
02:14:21,570 --> 02:14:22,350
I mean,
she doesn't know.

3382
02:14:22,350 --> 02:14:24,720
She doesn't even have a background in 
medical science.

3383
02:14:24,721 --> 02:14:26,340
She's not like,
she doesn't have a degree.

3384
02:14:26,630 --> 02:14:27,463
It's not like she's a phd and some sort 
of bioengineering or blood testing or 

3385
02:14:32,011 --> 02:14:33,480
whatever the fuck it would be.
Yeah,

3386
02:14:33,980 --> 02:14:34,813
it's a,
it's a crazy story because she was 

3387
02:14:36,451 --> 02:14:37,140
saying,
hey,

3388
02:14:37,140 --> 02:14:40,170
exactly as drastic part.
Look,

3389
02:14:40,171 --> 02:14:42,660
the part said the right words,
confidence,

3390
02:14:42,661 --> 02:14:44,010
tricks to comes along and says,
Hey,

3391
02:14:44,011 --> 02:14:46,020
you're interested in a woman doing this.
I'm a woman.

3392
02:14:46,290 --> 02:14:47,070
I'm doing this.

3393
02:14:47,070 --> 02:14:47,903
I remember before she get exposed,
watching that video of her talking 

3394
02:14:50,071 --> 02:14:51,780
going,
this not seem like a smart,

3395
02:14:51,990 --> 02:14:52,823
yeah.
If she's just like rambling along and 

3396
02:14:54,450 --> 02:14:57,000
kind of disjointed or something.
It was just clunky.

3397
02:14:57,110 --> 02:14:59,060
Yeah.
Like pull up CV.

3398
02:14:59,070 --> 02:15:02,430
You could find Elizabeth.
Is that her name?

3399
02:15:02,520 --> 02:15:05,820
Stan knows what the fuck was her name.
I forgot what her name is.

3400
02:15:05,880 --> 02:15:08,220
Theranose was the,
what was her name?

3401
02:15:09,190 --> 02:15:11,090
Looking at pictures ever.
It doesn't say her name anywhere,

3402
02:15:12,920 --> 02:15:14,580
but you know I did.
I did hear about it,

3403
02:15:14,581 --> 02:15:15,414
but I'll,
I'll have to check it out some of the 

3404
02:15:15,901 --> 02:15:16,830
time.
Yeah,

3405
02:15:17,610 --> 02:15:19,470
but it's,
look again,

3406
02:15:19,650 --> 02:15:20,850
this is,
what's that?

3407
02:15:20,880 --> 02:15:21,780
Elizabeth Holmes?
Yeah.

3408
02:15:21,781 --> 02:15:22,960
Okay,
so not,

3409
02:15:22,980 --> 02:15:23,813
it's not discrediting women.
This is not discrediting the idea of a 

3410
02:15:26,101 --> 02:15:26,934
genius woman.
This is not discrediting the idea of a 

3411
02:15:28,501 --> 02:15:29,334
genius entrepreneurial woman.
What this is fascinating to me is a 

3412
02:15:32,611 --> 02:15:37,611
person who fits all of these categories 
that people are clearly looking for.

3413
02:15:37,650 --> 02:15:38,310
Yeah.
Right.

3414
02:15:38,310 --> 02:15:40,220
And they just boil into x is what the 
answer is.

3415
02:15:40,260 --> 02:15:42,570
Identity politics.
Because confirmation bias,

3416
02:15:42,870 --> 02:15:45,420
and we love the fact that it's strong 
woman is doing this.

3417
02:15:45,720 --> 02:15:46,820
It's amazing.
It's just true.

3418
02:15:46,860 --> 02:15:50,330
I'm with her Hashtag they went with the 
Marine Le Pen though.

3419
02:15:50,331 --> 02:15:51,360
Where they,
who's that?

3420
02:15:51,420 --> 02:15:52,620
Oh,
the French woman.

3421
02:15:52,710 --> 02:15:53,281
Oh,
that's right.

3422
02:15:53,281 --> 02:15:56,520
Yeah.
Well that's the thing,

3423
02:15:56,521 --> 02:15:57,001
isn't it?
Oh,

3424
02:15:57,001 --> 02:15:57,721
well you know,
I mean,

3425
02:15:57,721 --> 02:16:00,330
I know that she's the woman,
but I'm filling for Alexander macron.

3426
02:16:00,331 --> 02:16:01,164
Yeah,
but Yo,

3427
02:16:01,230 --> 02:16:02,650
I'm with her on you,
right?

3428
02:16:02,700 --> 02:16:03,151
Oh,
you know,

3429
02:16:03,151 --> 02:16:05,670
I'm with her when she thinks wrong.
So it's not that she's a woman,

3430
02:16:05,671 --> 02:16:09,390
it's the way she fucking thinks.
Why can't we just be honest about this?

3431
02:16:09,440 --> 02:16:11,460
You know that Merck hell ladies a trip 
to,

3432
02:16:11,610 --> 02:16:12,750
oh,
Michael's cancer.

3433
02:16:12,960 --> 02:16:13,793
She's,
I can't believe the judge Germany get 

3434
02:16:15,361 --> 02:16:16,520
rid of Merkel.
Well,

3435
02:16:16,690 --> 02:16:18,210
what are you doing?
What are you doing?

3436
02:16:18,810 --> 02:16:21,300
She's a trip.
When I know about her,

3437
02:16:21,330 --> 02:16:22,163
if I know who's running Germany,
the gentleman's just can't help 

3438
02:16:25,471 --> 02:16:27,360
themselves.
What are they doing over there?

3439
02:16:27,870 --> 02:16:29,860
Uh,
with wall with her.

3440
02:16:30,380 --> 02:16:33,430
That's an Ma Ma Merkel's I speak to you 
again.

3441
02:16:33,431 --> 02:16:35,080
My friend crowd,
he tells me about these things.

3442
02:16:35,800 --> 02:16:38,470
She's famous for her and I don't want to
say flip flopping,

3443
02:16:38,770 --> 02:16:39,603
but I would like,
I would actually be a little more 

3444
02:16:40,681 --> 02:16:41,890
charitable than say her.
Um,

3445
02:16:42,800 --> 02:16:47,800
her navigation of the political wins.
Hillary in that way,

3446
02:16:47,801 --> 02:16:50,080
I guess why she uses is an opportunist.
Another one.

3447
02:16:51,170 --> 02:16:54,730
I think it's unfair to call opportunists
cause that's sailors really,

3448
02:16:54,731 --> 02:16:56,080
really,
it's being a smart politician,

3449
02:16:56,081 --> 02:16:56,920
isn't it?
It's saying well,

3450
02:16:57,250 --> 02:16:58,083
okay.
What,

3451
02:16:58,090 --> 02:17:00,340
I mean,
where are people going that's important,

3452
02:17:00,341 --> 02:17:02,440
that smarter anymore?
Well,

3453
02:17:02,441 --> 02:17:03,190
no,
I think it,

3454
02:17:03,190 --> 02:17:04,023
I think it means you lack credibility.
It makes you look like you don't stand 

3455
02:17:06,791 --> 02:17:07,720
for anything.
Well look,

3456
02:17:08,050 --> 02:17:08,883
as much as trump lies and he's,
he lied all the 600 plus times in the 

3457
02:17:14,680 --> 02:17:15,820
hundred plus times that he was in 
office.

3458
02:17:15,821 --> 02:17:19,480
They did a count of all the times he 
said things that weren't true publicly.

3459
02:17:20,200 --> 02:17:22,690
As much as he does that.
Everybody knows that's what he does.

3460
02:17:23,210 --> 02:17:25,660
Like they know who he is.
They know what he does.

3461
02:17:25,661 --> 02:17:26,494
They know he tweets all the time.
So even if he tweets something 

3462
02:17:28,841 --> 02:17:30,820
ridiculous,
they know who that is.

3463
02:17:31,060 --> 02:17:33,070
That's that guy.
That's him.

3464
02:17:33,071 --> 02:17:34,840
That's what he really thinks.
That's why he's saying it.

3465
02:17:35,290 --> 02:17:39,340
You never got that with Hillary Clinton,
which you got is these weird boiled down

3466
02:17:39,341 --> 02:17:42,070
messages.
It seemed like they were put together in

3467
02:17:42,071 --> 02:17:45,370
some sort of a of a writer's room.
Yeah,

3468
02:17:45,460 --> 02:17:46,061
it was.
I mean,

3469
02:17:46,061 --> 02:17:48,340
she doesn't control its twitter account.
No.

3470
02:17:48,670 --> 02:17:49,503
Doubtedly but trump undoubtedly is in 
control of his and 200% it's so 

3471
02:17:53,081 --> 02:17:54,760
hilarious.
I thought it was hilarious.

3472
02:17:54,920 --> 02:17:56,800
She wrote to him,
delete your account.

3473
02:17:57,210 --> 02:17:58,870
Yes.
That's nice.

3474
02:17:58,900 --> 02:18:00,070
Legit banter.
It's good.

3475
02:18:00,400 --> 02:18:02,710
That was good.
Got to give it up to her there,

3476
02:18:02,740 --> 02:18:05,320
but I don't know who wrote that was 
probably some 20 year old kid somewhere.

3477
02:18:05,320 --> 02:18:06,630
She probably wrote it.
Yeah.

3478
02:18:07,060 --> 02:18:09,250
Gursky's work at four 12 guys.
Who knows?

3479
02:18:09,460 --> 02:18:10,293
Yeah.
She for the social media manager at 

3480
02:18:11,351 --> 02:18:12,184
Wendy's tweeted out,
pepe the of the Wendy's icon as a peppy 

3481
02:18:15,490 --> 02:18:16,750
oh no,
shit.

3482
02:18:16,751 --> 02:18:18,670
Stolen,
absolute shit on.

3483
02:18:18,680 --> 02:18:20,290
They were forced to delete it.
And who knows what?

3484
02:18:20,291 --> 02:18:21,124
That person still has a job,
but people who think that pepe is 

3485
02:18:23,230 --> 02:18:25,630
outright and you're saying Pepsi's not 
outright.

3486
02:18:25,660 --> 02:18:26,650
They all right,
use pam pay.

3487
02:18:26,651 --> 02:18:29,920
But everyone uses pepe.
Pepe is a ubiquitous internet symbol,

3488
02:18:30,670 --> 02:18:34,510
sort of dissonance and chaos.
More importantly,

3489
02:18:34,540 --> 02:18:36,940
um,
disrespect,

3490
02:18:37,180 --> 02:18:41,280
but isn't keck like the god of chaos or 
sensate up,

3491
02:18:41,400 --> 02:18:42,800
uh,
this little made up,

3492
02:18:42,801 --> 02:18:45,010
made up.
What I think is makeup.

3493
02:18:45,250 --> 02:18:47,070
It's like,
what if you die and you meet Keck?

3494
02:18:47,080 --> 02:18:49,360
Would you be feeling bad?
Cause you said he was made up.

3495
02:18:49,480 --> 02:18:52,720
I'll be quite surprised.
I'd be like,

3496
02:18:52,721 --> 02:18:53,554
okay,
you're going to have to work with me 

3497
02:18:54,371 --> 02:18:55,420
here because let's be honest.

3498
02:18:55,600 --> 02:18:57,560
Would you have believed it?
No.

3499
02:18:58,140 --> 02:19:00,570
No,
but yeah,

3500
02:19:00,910 --> 02:19:03,700
that would be so shocked if he let her 
gold robe.

3501
02:19:03,890 --> 02:19:06,940
It was a frog and you got to have an 
oncology and there's,

3502
02:19:07,000 --> 02:19:07,833
there's,
it literally looks like pepe then that 

3503
02:19:10,470 --> 02:19:12,940
he's got a gold robe on.
Can I piss off?

3504
02:19:12,941 --> 02:19:14,920
Like literally everyone who believes in 
a religion,

3505
02:19:16,030 --> 02:19:18,520
why would you want to?
Because what about hope?

3506
02:19:19,180 --> 02:19:20,013
Doesn't it just struck you as in this 
childish fucking thing that depends on 

3507
02:19:22,500 --> 02:19:23,333
what I'm going to go somewhere.
Is Nino not scientology that that's 

3508
02:19:26,591 --> 02:19:28,790
starting to make sense to me.
I can tell actually,

3509
02:19:29,030 --> 02:19:30,200
but I,
like I said up,

3510
02:19:30,210 --> 02:19:31,880
been watching but said no,
seriously.

3511
02:19:31,881 --> 02:19:32,714
It's obviously wishful thinking and it's
obvious because you're afraid of dying 

3512
02:19:34,131 --> 02:19:35,690
and it's obviously that you just want to
believe it.

3513
02:19:35,691 --> 02:19:36,524
It's not true.
You fucking might just want that gold 

3514
02:19:37,941 --> 02:19:39,080
metal and that is not true.

3515
02:19:39,140 --> 02:19:44,140
I want that scientology gold medal that 
gave Tom cruise the big one,

3516
02:19:44,811 --> 02:19:45,644
like a laptop.
It looks like flavor flavor up there 

3517
02:19:47,331 --> 02:19:48,164
with that fucking gold medal on.
Isn't it so arrogant to think that 

3518
02:19:50,901 --> 02:19:53,060
humans are so important that they're 
going to go to an afterlife?

3519
02:19:53,750 --> 02:19:55,720
It might be right.
You know the,

3520
02:19:55,721 --> 02:19:56,554
the afterlife isn't that arrogant to me 
because it's the idea is that like 

3521
02:20:00,890 --> 02:20:04,280
you're trying to just pass on life,
right?

3522
02:20:04,580 --> 02:20:08,750
And the mind understands that this is 
sort of a few tile effort.

3523
02:20:08,780 --> 02:20:11,060
You're temporary.
You have a finite life,

3524
02:20:11,630 --> 02:20:12,360
you know,
like what,

3525
02:20:12,360 --> 02:20:13,460
what are you doing?
Why,

3526
02:20:13,461 --> 02:20:14,294
why even bother?
I just end this now you're constantly 

3527
02:20:16,161 --> 02:20:17,960
suffering.
Just jump off a building.

3528
02:20:18,230 --> 02:20:18,981
So no,
no,

3529
02:20:18,981 --> 02:20:19,814
no.
We can't do that because there's a 

3530
02:20:20,181 --> 02:20:22,880
greater good waiting for us.
There's a greater thing.

3531
02:20:22,881 --> 02:20:26,540
There's another level of the video game 
that doesn't make sense if,

3532
02:20:26,541 --> 02:20:28,880
if,
if you're going to go to heaven when you

3533
02:20:28,890 --> 02:20:30,560
dunk,
kill yourself,

3534
02:20:31,660 --> 02:20:32,270
but you can't.

3535
02:20:32,270 --> 02:20:35,240
That's a loophole.
So you can't go to heaven.

3536
02:20:35,260 --> 02:20:36,860
Yeah,
kill yourself.

3537
02:20:36,861 --> 02:20:39,470
You make the people around you that 
loved you suffer.

3538
02:20:40,040 --> 02:20:41,420
So you don't go to heaven when you kill 
yourself.

3539
02:20:41,421 --> 02:20:43,650
That's convenient.
Or it's God's plan.

3540
02:20:43,700 --> 02:20:44,720
They kill you.
What?

3541
02:20:45,060 --> 02:20:46,190
Where's your part of the Colt,
Richard?

3542
02:20:46,191 --> 02:20:47,180
And I'm like,
you know,

3543
02:20:47,190 --> 02:20:50,460
we'll just gonna drink the Koolaid,
the prism cooling and kill cells.

3544
02:20:50,480 --> 02:20:51,890
Well,
they answered that with Jesus.

3545
02:20:51,950 --> 02:20:53,930
Jesus on the cross.
That's why we still do this.

3546
02:20:54,440 --> 02:20:55,273
We literally make the,
make the cross sign that the thing that 

3547
02:20:58,881 --> 02:20:59,714
killed him.
B Bill Hicks had a great joke about 

3548
02:21:01,431 --> 02:21:02,151
that.
He goes,

3549
02:21:02,151 --> 02:21:04,880
it's like going up to Jackie on the 
assets with a rifle on.

3550
02:21:05,280 --> 02:21:06,113
He was just thinking of John Jackson.
Imagine if you'd like a pagan or 

3551
02:21:08,721 --> 02:21:11,240
something back in like the seventh 
century or whatever and you're,

3552
02:21:11,241 --> 02:21:11,691
you're,
you know,

3553
02:21:11,691 --> 02:21:12,524
northern European Lithuanian or 
something and then these Germans coming 

3554
02:21:14,551 --> 02:21:15,384
in and go,
hey,

3555
02:21:15,620 --> 02:21:17,420
we've got this religion about dead guy.

3556
02:21:18,590 --> 02:21:20,670
We think you should join it.
We blog.

3557
02:21:20,690 --> 02:21:22,770
Why?
Well it's,

3558
02:21:22,820 --> 02:21:24,680
it's really sad.
It's really sad story.

3559
02:21:24,681 --> 02:21:26,090
But he died for your sins.
But yeah,

3560
02:21:26,110 --> 02:21:28,940
every way you go.
This guy just being killed on the cross.

3561
02:21:29,320 --> 02:21:29,811
He was like,
you know,

3562
02:21:29,811 --> 02:21:33,440
my religion is way more fun than that.
Yeah.

3563
02:21:33,441 --> 02:21:34,274
You have the original sin too.
That's the great thing that you brought 

3564
02:21:36,441 --> 02:21:37,274
up earlier about being white.
I mean it's sort of like just being a 

3565
02:21:40,041 --> 02:21:41,390
human.
The original sin,

3566
02:21:41,391 --> 02:21:42,224
the only way they can have complete 
total control over you is to say that 

3567
02:21:44,181 --> 02:21:45,014
you are guilty no matter what.
Just by virtue of being born believing 

3568
02:21:47,651 --> 02:21:50,350
of guilty if then it works.
Yeah.

3569
02:21:50,390 --> 02:21:51,223
It starts from that,
that this all knowing infinite thing 

3570
02:21:53,720 --> 02:21:56,000
that looks over the universe is 
incredibly petty.

3571
02:21:56,001 --> 02:21:58,120
Very jealous if you,
if you,

3572
02:21:58,620 --> 02:22:00,200
yeah.
If you go well that's worship.

3573
02:22:00,201 --> 02:22:02,000
Anything else,
any other false idols?

3574
02:22:02,090 --> 02:22:05,030
DEF You wear two different types of 
clothes.

3575
02:22:05,090 --> 02:22:06,080
Death.
Yeah.

3576
02:22:06,560 --> 02:22:06,980
You know,
it's,

3577
02:22:06,980 --> 02:22:07,813
it's um,
really interesting cause there there've 

3578
02:22:08,930 --> 02:22:11,270
been religions in the past that thought 
that that was an evil God,

3579
02:22:11,650 --> 02:22:12,483
the crate to the earth and everything in
the F is created by an evil God and 

3580
02:22:15,381 --> 02:22:16,214
there is a loving God beyond it,
but you can't pray to it and has no 

3581
02:22:18,861 --> 02:22:19,694
interaction.
Yeah.

3582
02:22:19,700 --> 02:22:20,533
The Yoni,
you got to get past earth yet basically 

3583
02:22:22,071 --> 02:22:23,670
you have to live a good life.
And eventually Ocala,

3584
02:22:23,870 --> 02:22:24,703
well maybe it's true.
Maybe it's like this is a level of the 

3585
02:22:25,771 --> 02:22:26,040
video

3586
02:22:26,040 --> 02:22:26,840
game,
right?

3587
02:22:26,840 --> 02:22:29,050
Maybe you get past those.
No.

3588
02:22:29,250 --> 02:22:31,800
What if it did you get through and 
that's awesome.

3589
02:22:31,920 --> 02:22:32,753
I'll put money on it.
It's not worth anything in the 

3590
02:22:34,321 --> 02:22:35,340
afterlife,
sir.

3591
02:22:35,500 --> 02:22:35,941
Okay.
Okay,

3592
02:22:35,941 --> 02:22:37,380
well I'll put whatever you want on it.
Right.

3593
02:22:37,381 --> 02:22:39,870
And in the US I say,
and if it's true in the afterlife,

3594
02:22:39,871 --> 02:22:40,704
all blue,
but the absolute no one has in the 

3595
02:22:42,031 --> 02:22:44,640
afterlife.
But you're like in a few real being,

3596
02:22:44,641 --> 02:22:47,180
you're like 70 failure.
I know Matt Dude,

3597
02:22:47,200 --> 02:22:47,791
Dude,
dude,

3598
02:22:47,791 --> 02:22:49,170
I do.
Now I've had,

3599
02:22:49,830 --> 02:22:52,260
I've had a near death experience,
man,

3600
02:22:52,560 --> 02:22:54,060
I've been there,
man.

3601
02:22:54,120 --> 02:22:54,953
It's obviously such wishful thinking 
that says they know as soon as someone 

3602
02:22:58,531 --> 02:22:59,190
says,
yeah,

3603
02:22:59,190 --> 02:23:00,023
I know what happens.
Even if you say I know that you die and 

3604
02:23:02,341 --> 02:23:04,260
there's nothing,
well you definitely don't.

3605
02:23:04,830 --> 02:23:06,390
You definitely don't know.
Don't know.

3606
02:23:06,391 --> 02:23:07,224
But if I'm going to put money on it,
I mean like I would definitely wouldn't 

3607
02:23:08,761 --> 02:23:11,580
put money on it because the money's 
useless when your dad,

3608
02:23:11,670 --> 02:23:12,840
but I mean like now you know?

3609
02:23:13,420 --> 02:23:14,510
Yeah but tomorrow,
no,

3610
02:23:14,511 --> 02:23:15,360
no,
it's not for me.

3611
02:23:15,670 --> 02:23:16,503
Tomorrow they might be able to prove it.
The amazing tomorrow if you get to a 

3612
02:23:19,741 --> 02:23:22,200
betting agency it's like,
well actually scientists have discovered

3613
02:23:22,530 --> 02:23:26,430
the God is real and it turns out that 
there are 72 virgins waiting in heaven.

3614
02:23:26,431 --> 02:23:29,400
So maybe you just convert to Islam now.
You know you blow shit.

3615
02:23:29,401 --> 02:23:30,340
Okay.
And low walk.

3616
02:23:30,660 --> 02:23:34,710
Did you ever see that priest that got in
trouble because he took photos of him in

3617
02:23:34,711 --> 02:23:39,030
heaven and he was selling photos of him 
and heaven is wonderful.

3618
02:23:39,180 --> 02:23:44,180
It's him like waving and he's in this 
pure white background and he said,

3619
02:23:47,370 --> 02:23:48,840
I put it on my toy,
it's on my,

3620
02:23:49,250 --> 02:23:53,180
my instagram account from a while back 
as such.

3621
02:23:53,210 --> 02:23:55,470
But you could find a jamie.
It's hilarious.

3622
02:23:55,471 --> 02:23:56,304
He's funny.
He's,

3623
02:23:56,480 --> 02:23:58,050
I mean he's,
it's,

3624
02:23:58,100 --> 02:23:58,933
it's,
it's adorable because he's so fucking 

3625
02:24:00,991 --> 02:24:01,500
stupid.

3626
02:24:01,500 --> 02:24:04,410
Like the thing is so fucking stupid that
it makes you just go.

3627
02:24:05,510 --> 02:24:06,960
It's like that.
Um,

3628
02:24:07,200 --> 02:24:09,930
I just found out about this too the 
other day drawn Horton,

3629
02:24:09,980 --> 02:24:12,720
uh,
told me about the 18 year old kid that,

3630
02:24:12,721 --> 02:24:13,554
uh,
was running a medical practice and he 

3631
02:24:15,421 --> 02:24:19,290
did not have a,
any medicine was chiropractor basically,

3632
02:24:19,740 --> 02:24:22,440
but they,
they busted him and he sat down and gave

3633
02:24:22,441 --> 02:24:24,870
interviews and said that he's being 
persecuted.

3634
02:24:24,871 --> 02:24:27,480
And so all of the true facts will come 
to light,

3635
02:24:27,481 --> 02:24:30,120
but it's the way it's edited is so 
funny.

3636
02:24:30,150 --> 02:24:31,050
I mean,
it's really,

3637
02:24:31,051 --> 02:24:31,890
really funny.
I mean,

3638
02:24:31,891 --> 02:24:34,000
this guy has a loon,
this kid like sounds it.

3639
02:24:34,001 --> 02:24:34,834
Yeah.
Did you find the photo of the guy in 

3640
02:24:35,431 --> 02:24:36,264
heaven?

3641
02:24:41,570 --> 02:24:44,970
There he is.
He's got his hand up.

3642
02:24:44,971 --> 02:24:48,130
This is a full version of it where you 
could see like more of them with,

3643
02:24:48,240 --> 02:24:49,200
yeah,
it's like that,

3644
02:24:49,440 --> 02:24:52,050
but it's all just,
it's not that it's white.

3645
02:24:52,380 --> 02:24:54,480
It's not a fake one.
Oh,

3646
02:24:54,481 --> 02:24:56,460
it's whatsapp.
$5,000

3647
02:24:56,461 --> 02:24:57,810
for one.
Yeah.

3648
02:24:57,811 --> 02:25:02,811
He was charging people for the photo of 
him in heaven and he was,

3649
02:25:03,570 --> 02:25:07,370
I guess he was going to sign it.
You mentioned what kind of more on you'd

3650
02:25:07,371 --> 02:25:09,150
have to be.
Yes.

3651
02:25:09,300 --> 02:25:10,800
Look at this.
Look at the quote.

3652
02:25:11,040 --> 02:25:13,020
I just want to bless everyone with the 
experience.

3653
02:25:13,021 --> 02:25:15,660
I had talked with Jesus.
He's a great guy.

3654
02:25:16,070 --> 02:25:16,903
Showed me a lot of love.
I can't wait to get back up there with 

3655
02:25:19,231 --> 02:25:20,064
him.

3656
02:25:24,660 --> 02:25:26,770
That's it.
You met the king of kings.

3657
02:25:26,771 --> 02:25:31,390
You met the son of God.
You met her and this is what he says.

3658
02:25:31,450 --> 02:25:35,140
He says he's a great guy.
He showed me a lot of love.

3659
02:25:35,170 --> 02:25:36,520
Oh,
well for sure.

3660
02:25:36,760 --> 02:25:39,400
It sounds like you had a real 
transcendent experience with Jesus.

3661
02:25:39,790 --> 02:25:43,450
He's a great guy.
He pictures on his galaxy smartphone.

3662
02:25:43,720 --> 02:25:48,720
He brought his fucking Samsung up into 
heaven was Paul.

3663
02:25:49,970 --> 02:25:50,803
That's,
that's basically [inaudible] stories 

3664
02:25:52,060 --> 02:25:53,200
based on a lot of the time,
you know,

3665
02:25:53,201 --> 02:25:54,770
so someone was,
you know,

3666
02:25:54,790 --> 02:25:59,790
like Enoch was taken up into the crystal
ship of God or Holy Shit,

3667
02:26:01,120 --> 02:26:03,550
it's just whole shit made up by idiots 
thousands of years ago.

3668
02:26:03,770 --> 02:26:06,280
I don't know what's going on.
They can't explain what's going on,

3669
02:26:06,281 --> 02:26:08,020
but they are kind of scared of getting 
killed.

3670
02:26:08,260 --> 02:26:11,230
And that's because it might really 
happen really fucking soon.

3671
02:26:11,440 --> 02:26:12,490
Let's get rid of us.
You know,

3672
02:26:12,790 --> 02:26:14,590
they're talking about an oral tradition.

3673
02:26:14,980 --> 02:26:19,270
Like those todd talked for thousands of 
years and then by the time someone wrote

3674
02:26:19,271 --> 02:26:20,104
it down,
yeah.

3675
02:26:20,170 --> 02:26:21,003
It wasn't the original Bible like a 
thousand years old by the time anybody 

3676
02:26:23,291 --> 02:26:25,750
wrote it down a well and validly that 
was,

3677
02:26:25,751 --> 02:26:27,370
I mean we don't know how old,
cause there was an old,

3678
02:26:27,380 --> 02:26:28,213
I don't even know.
Right.

3679
02:26:28,220 --> 02:26:29,053
Come from anybody,
you know,

3680
02:26:29,770 --> 02:26:30,603
will also,
when you hear like the similarities 

3681
02:26:31,811 --> 02:26:34,390
between like the Sumerian tech stories 
like oh yeah,

3682
02:26:34,420 --> 02:26:36,400
the epic of Gilgamesh is smear.
Yeah.

3683
02:26:36,640 --> 02:26:38,980
Really similar to Noah's Ark.
Oh yeah,

3684
02:26:38,981 --> 02:26:40,630
yeah.
The pitched him who,

3685
02:26:40,640 --> 02:26:41,321
uh,
you know,

3686
02:26:41,321 --> 02:26:43,450
survived the flood and whatnot.
And in fact,

3687
02:26:43,451 --> 02:26:45,480
it's like really so similar.
It's like the,

3688
02:26:45,530 --> 02:26:47,020
the,
it's almost the same words,

3689
02:26:47,021 --> 02:26:51,040
just replacing God with gods while they 
oversee from by God's with God.

3690
02:26:51,100 --> 02:26:51,933
And uh,
I'm the things we can even pinpoint the 

3691
02:26:53,171 --> 02:26:54,004
sort of time there's likely to have been
adopted into the religion during the 

3692
02:26:57,551 --> 02:26:58,440
Babylonian Exxon.

3693
02:26:58,450 --> 02:27:02,950
When the Assyrians conquered the nation 
of Israel and left Judah,

3694
02:27:03,100 --> 02:27:03,933
they undoubtedly that they took them 
back to all the series of Babylonians 

3695
02:27:08,320 --> 02:27:09,153
under Nebuchadnezzar,
took them back to Babylon and then 

3696
02:27:10,871 --> 02:27:13,240
they're the,
they're the smart Jews were the elite,

3697
02:27:13,241 --> 02:27:16,150
the educated people.
And unsurprisingly,

3698
02:27:16,151 --> 02:27:18,860
suddenly the myths includes loads of 
Mesopotamia.

3699
02:27:18,861 --> 02:27:20,320
My ideas.
Well,

3700
02:27:20,321 --> 02:27:21,700
what did that come from?
Genius.

3701
02:27:21,701 --> 02:27:22,534
You know?
And then they go back and so all of a 

3702
02:27:23,501 --> 02:27:24,161
sudden,
okay,

3703
02:27:24,161 --> 02:27:25,240
it's cool incorporated.
Okay.

3704
02:27:25,241 --> 02:27:26,070
Yeah.
It's,

3705
02:27:26,070 --> 02:27:26,903
this is a whole shit.
It's all bull shit and there's no 

3706
02:27:28,421 --> 02:27:29,254
benefit into really trying to include 
the older stuff that they find each 

3707
02:27:31,790 --> 02:27:34,540
other and try to like figure out whether
or not these are connected.

3708
02:27:34,980 --> 02:27:36,100
Stupid.
It's just like,

3709
02:27:36,500 --> 02:27:38,320
I mean it's just like,
there are so many golds.

3710
02:27:38,321 --> 02:27:39,940
Why that one?
Why that one?

3711
02:27:40,360 --> 02:27:42,100
You don't know,
probably cause you grew up with it,

3712
02:27:42,101 --> 02:27:42,760
right.

3713
02:27:42,760 --> 02:27:44,290
You weren't reasoned until that ability 
you went,

3714
02:27:44,291 --> 02:27:45,400
you,
you weren't reasonable and positioning,

3715
02:27:45,401 --> 02:27:46,360
you didn't send anything.
You know,

3716
02:27:46,660 --> 02:27:49,970
I've had a think and I think it's 
melodic.

3717
02:27:50,060 --> 02:27:52,060
That's,
I was thinking about it.

3718
02:27:52,090 --> 02:27:54,170
I was thinking Tmr yeah,
it was wild.

3719
02:27:54,180 --> 02:27:56,860
It tame amount you couldn't really have,
cause that's like a primordial God.

3720
02:27:57,010 --> 02:27:58,600
But that's how I like,
I like the old ones.

3721
02:27:58,720 --> 02:27:59,553
Yeah.
But they don't then,

3722
02:27:59,580 --> 02:28:00,413
you know,
you couldn't pray Tim outside Krom No 

3723
02:28:02,210 --> 02:28:03,440
pray to crime.
He doesn't listen.

3724
02:28:03,640 --> 02:28:04,720
He doesn't.
But no,

3725
02:28:05,290 --> 02:28:07,150
I mean I like Asher to be honest.
You know,

3726
02:28:07,160 --> 02:28:08,780
wished her.
But um,

3727
02:28:08,980 --> 02:28:10,360
you know,
it's just like,

3728
02:28:10,900 --> 02:28:12,460
it's nonsense.
It's all nonsense.

3729
02:28:12,980 --> 02:28:15,160
It's all a myth.
And it's fascinating.

3730
02:28:15,161 --> 02:28:15,994
And what's interesting to me is the 
historical idea that these people were 

3731
02:28:19,060 --> 02:28:22,880
living by these stories like thousands 
of years ago.

3732
02:28:22,880 --> 02:28:25,280
And like what?
Like you try to put it in context.

3733
02:28:25,281 --> 02:28:29,510
Imagine what it would be like living 
thousands of years ago with no science,

3734
02:28:29,511 --> 02:28:33,290
with no education and limited 
understanding of the world around you.

3735
02:28:33,291 --> 02:28:37,370
And then there you are abiding by these 
ancient stories.

3736
02:28:37,371 --> 02:28:40,610
And it's a fascinating thing,
like the Dead Sea Scrolls.

3737
02:28:40,611 --> 02:28:41,444
That's really fascinating stuff because 
they've been dave and deciphering that 

3738
02:28:44,421 --> 02:28:45,254
forever.
But they don't incorporate it into the 

3739
02:28:46,341 --> 02:28:48,080
Christian doctrine.
No,

3740
02:28:48,230 --> 02:28:49,063
it's not.
It's not a party to codify to Kong 

3741
02:28:50,430 --> 02:28:52,760
revisit it.
What did they do about that?

3742
02:28:52,761 --> 02:28:53,594
Because if they know that that's ancient
religious text and it's as old as 

3743
02:28:56,631 --> 02:28:58,280
anything that they've found,
right.

3744
02:28:58,310 --> 02:29:01,670
It's the oldest version of the Bible.
It's old as fuck.

3745
02:29:01,730 --> 02:29:03,110
Yeah.
And these,

3746
02:29:03,530 --> 02:29:04,490
you know,
they don't use it.

3747
02:29:05,060 --> 02:29:05,541
Yeah,
exactly.

3748
02:29:05,541 --> 02:29:06,470
Weird.
But let's,

3749
02:29:06,471 --> 02:29:07,304
cause they'd have to change the beliefs 
and they went reasoned into these 

3750
02:29:09,111 --> 02:29:09,980
beliefs.
So they're gonna be like,

3751
02:29:09,981 --> 02:29:10,814
no,
I don't have,

3752
02:29:10,930 --> 02:29:11,600
they just ignore it.

3753
02:29:11,600 --> 02:29:12,920
They've got a narrative.
They just ignore it.

3754
02:29:13,010 --> 02:29:13,843
I wonder what they did,
what the official position of like the 

3755
02:29:15,861 --> 02:29:18,830
Catholic church is about.
Like the Dead Sea Scrolls.

3756
02:29:18,831 --> 02:29:21,160
I don't give a shit with the Catholic 
Church says I'm fascinating.

3757
02:29:21,530 --> 02:29:22,011
Well,
yeah,

3758
02:29:22,011 --> 02:29:23,690
but one thing that,
um,

3759
02:29:24,510 --> 02:29:25,231
oh,
I was gonna say,

3760
02:29:25,231 --> 02:29:27,670
one thing that bugs me about fit is,
um,

3761
02:29:28,400 --> 02:29:29,530
I'll come up.
I was gonna say answering,

3762
02:29:29,560 --> 02:29:31,100
how does this pull,
you brought the Catholic church.

3763
02:29:31,270 --> 02:29:32,103
You got to,
we blew a fuse and my brother Catholic 

3764
02:29:33,430 --> 02:29:34,200
churches,
I,

3765
02:29:34,200 --> 02:29:35,090
yeah,
just,

3766
02:29:35,100 --> 02:29:38,810
just super bummed out about them.
They say the Catholic church,

3767
02:29:38,811 --> 02:29:39,890
his whole shit.
Oh,

3768
02:29:39,891 --> 02:29:41,840
it certainly is this,
this is my problem with,

3769
02:29:41,841 --> 02:29:43,550
and it's just like,
I mean,

3770
02:29:44,570 --> 02:29:47,780
if someone wants to believe in stuff,
that's fine.

3771
02:29:47,960 --> 02:29:49,580
This is one.
Secularism is important,

3772
02:29:49,581 --> 02:29:50,241
you know,
it's,

3773
02:29:50,241 --> 02:29:52,340
I butts,
it's like identitarian politics,

3774
02:29:52,490 --> 02:29:53,750
you know?
It's just a tender mass to get.

3775
02:29:53,750 --> 02:29:55,720
But let me tell you about my ex,
you know,

3776
02:29:55,770 --> 02:29:57,550
but you're just talking about yourself,
right?

3777
02:29:57,610 --> 02:29:58,850
You know,
you don't talking about a problem that's

3778
02:29:58,851 --> 02:30:01,070
external to you.
You're saying I have a problem.

3779
02:30:01,071 --> 02:30:04,220
I believe something.
I believe in God.

3780
02:30:04,221 --> 02:30:06,470
I believe that black people are this.
I believe that white people this,

3781
02:30:06,680 --> 02:30:06,981
I mean,
yeah,

3782
02:30:06,981 --> 02:30:07,814
but I didn't,
we can't,

3783
02:30:07,820 --> 02:30:08,360
you know,
tell me,

3784
02:30:08,360 --> 02:30:09,193
tell me about the things that are 
external to you that actually are 

3785
02:30:10,461 --> 02:30:11,294
affecting things you know in you rather 
than things that are in you that are 

3786
02:30:13,671 --> 02:30:14,840
coming out.
I don't care about that.

3787
02:30:15,140 --> 02:30:15,973
You've got this the wrong way round.
I just find it fascinating that there's 

3788
02:30:18,441 --> 02:30:23,150
like a certain level of like when you go
back in time,

3789
02:30:23,180 --> 02:30:24,013
there's a certain level of history,
like they way you just ignore those 

3790
02:30:26,511 --> 02:30:29,630
ideas.
Like when you get past 4,000

3791
02:30:29,631 --> 02:30:32,390
years old,
like an epic of Gilgamesh is no one just

3792
02:30:32,391 --> 02:30:34,900
trying to live by the Sumerian texts.

3793
02:30:34,940 --> 02:30:36,500
There's no one as treating that as a 
religion.

3794
02:30:36,501 --> 02:30:36,980
Right?
Yeah.

3795
02:30:36,980 --> 02:30:40,890
The ancient Mesopotamian stories are 
basically thought of is purely myths.

3796
02:30:40,891 --> 02:30:43,390
Yeah.
Just like Odin and thor and zoom,

3797
02:30:43,560 --> 02:30:45,620
that's all abandoned.
But at one point in time,

3798
02:30:45,621 --> 02:30:46,454
that was the ideology to live.
I liked the way that God's never really 

3799
02:30:49,041 --> 02:30:49,874
get resurrected and I,
I don't really believe the neo pagans 

3800
02:30:52,851 --> 02:30:54,710
and stuff like this,
so I actually believe in this night.

3801
02:30:54,760 --> 02:30:57,260
Don't you just think it's cool?
They think it's cool.

3802
02:30:57,380 --> 02:30:58,190
Yeah.
Yeah.

3803
02:30:58,190 --> 02:30:59,630
Weekend.
Yeah.

3804
02:31:00,110 --> 02:31:00,960
And not wicked.
Wicked.

3805
02:31:00,961 --> 02:31:03,560
It is not like old either.
That's like a knee.

3806
02:31:03,590 --> 02:31:06,470
That was like 19th century or something 
to allow that was invented.

3807
02:31:06,930 --> 02:31:07,790
Oh,
that's even dumber.

3808
02:31:07,820 --> 02:31:08,470
Yeah,
I know.

3809
02:31:08,470 --> 02:31:09,303
Isn't there,
it's like the oldest version of the 

3810
02:31:12,261 --> 02:31:13,460
Mormons.
Yeah.

3811
02:31:13,520 --> 02:31:14,600
Oh,
I love them all.

3812
02:31:14,601 --> 02:31:16,040
And this was it Joseph Smith,
is it?

3813
02:31:16,041 --> 02:31:16,874
Yeah.
Yeah.

3814
02:31:16,880 --> 02:31:19,680
Dies in a gun fight or something like in
a prison

3815
02:31:19,980 --> 02:31:21,180
as like,
that's my kind of profit.

3816
02:31:21,320 --> 02:31:22,040
Well,
you know,

3817
02:31:22,040 --> 02:31:24,030
he's thinks it out when he was 14.
Yeah.

3818
02:31:24,090 --> 02:31:25,740
There's golden place and no one got 
sauce.

3819
02:31:25,770 --> 02:31:26,730
Good stuff.
I mean,

3820
02:31:27,000 --> 02:31:29,160
who do you know that's 14 that isn't 
full of shit.

3821
02:31:29,940 --> 02:31:30,773
Have you ever had a 14 year old tells 
you the truth and they were like this 

3822
02:31:33,390 --> 02:31:35,790
little lying all the time,
but know things.

3823
02:31:36,080 --> 02:31:37,740
Yeah.
This boy has wisdom.

3824
02:31:38,640 --> 02:31:41,220
Where did you learn this wisdom?
A golden tablet.

3825
02:31:41,221 --> 02:31:42,630
Come with me.
I'll show you where it is.

3826
02:31:43,050 --> 02:31:45,000
The angels knew we were coming and they 
took it away.

3827
02:31:46,650 --> 02:31:47,700
Well,
I'm persuaded.

3828
02:31:47,820 --> 02:31:48,653
Um,
what do you have your magic caesarstone 

3829
02:31:50,970 --> 02:31:52,290
Oh no,
they took that as well.

3830
02:31:52,650 --> 02:31:54,270
God,
it's so close.

3831
02:31:54,360 --> 02:31:55,380
So close.
Yeah.

3832
02:31:55,470 --> 02:31:56,303
But they did tell me before they left 
that I could have nine whys when you 

3833
02:32:00,910 --> 02:32:01,860
pitch just once,
getting lost.

3834
02:32:01,861 --> 02:32:03,450
You know,
one of my favorite thing about the Quran

3835
02:32:03,451 --> 02:32:06,280
and the Hadith says is a Mohammed 
basically,

3836
02:32:06,281 --> 02:32:09,300
he used to pull these fucking dictates 
from God,

3837
02:32:09,301 --> 02:32:10,134
abs us.

3838
02:32:10,380 --> 02:32:12,750
And at one point his child bride turn 
around to him and said,

3839
02:32:13,050 --> 02:32:14,670
you know,
paraphrasing,

3840
02:32:15,000 --> 02:32:15,833
but uh,
you know,

3841
02:32:16,320 --> 02:32:19,020
these are coming at surprisingly 
convenient times for you,

3842
02:32:19,060 --> 02:32:20,850
ma'am.
It's like,

3843
02:32:20,880 --> 02:32:21,713
oh,
he got called out by your child bride 

3844
02:32:25,111 --> 02:32:25,944
magnet because it's obvious you pulling 
this shit out of your ass for your own 

3845
02:32:29,191 --> 02:32:30,750
convenience.
It's just like,

3846
02:32:31,230 --> 02:32:33,420
and there were some really gross things 
about Mohammed as well.

3847
02:32:33,450 --> 02:32:35,400
I better not go and took some will 
probably kill me.

3848
02:32:35,820 --> 02:32:36,653
Isn't that amazing?
That you believe would have to worry 

3849
02:32:37,741 --> 02:32:38,700
about that?
Yeah.

3850
02:32:38,701 --> 02:32:39,534
Legit.
Yeah.

3851
02:32:40,170 --> 02:32:41,010
Yeah.
I mean,

3852
02:32:41,011 --> 02:32:44,540
people who have a mocked since we've got
some time anyway,

3853
02:32:44,590 --> 02:32:46,950
we were on the subject of Islam.
I think it's worth talking about.

3854
02:32:47,640 --> 02:32:49,250
Wahhabism I've been learning about that 
a lot.

3855
02:32:49,400 --> 02:32:50,510
Okay.
Um,

3856
02:32:50,640 --> 02:32:55,380
it's crazy and Muslims hate it.
It's like the sjws of the Muslim world.

3857
02:32:55,890 --> 02:32:56,723
Imagine if the country was taken over by
rabid sjws who had access to weaponry 

3858
02:33:02,410 --> 02:33:02,670
me.

3859
02:33:02,670 --> 02:33:03,400
Scary,
right?

3860
02:33:03,400 --> 02:33:04,233
Yeah.
Imagine if they had in every city like 

3861
02:33:05,760 --> 02:33:07,020
sjw,
police,

3862
02:33:07,380 --> 02:33:08,460
he went around saying,
right,

3863
02:33:08,640 --> 02:33:10,110
blacks over here,
whites over there,

3864
02:33:10,290 --> 02:33:11,700
men over here,
women over here.

3865
02:33:11,970 --> 02:33:16,140
And if you were even caught fraternizing
with the opposite race or sex,

3866
02:33:16,410 --> 02:33:17,243
that's it.
You're going to get the lash or maybe 

3867
02:33:18,031 --> 02:33:19,760
you get your hand chopped off for me,
you know,

3868
02:33:19,770 --> 02:33:20,603
whatever punishment in sexual social 
justice would meet out if given the 

3869
02:33:23,461 --> 02:33:24,294
option.
That's basically what it was like in 

3870
02:33:26,371 --> 02:33:30,360
Saudi Arabia that under isis.
So it really is in a lot of ways,

3871
02:33:30,420 --> 02:33:32,370
a lot of things that we've been talking 
about today,

3872
02:33:32,550 --> 02:33:33,383
they're very similar.
And if these were deep grooves that are 

3873
02:33:37,060 --> 02:33:37,893
human to,
and I imagine the kind of person who 

3874
02:33:40,051 --> 02:33:43,830
wants to be the person who enforces that
right piece of shit.

3875
02:33:44,040 --> 02:33:45,260
That's why these social justice 
warriors,

3876
02:33:45,270 --> 02:33:47,760
a piece of shit that's control freaks,
a control,

3877
02:33:47,761 --> 02:33:49,310
fixed moral busybodies.

3878
02:33:49,320 --> 02:33:50,153
I've got no real morals at all.
And people who lack a certain amount of 

3879
02:33:53,160 --> 02:33:53,993
objectivity,
which is why that certain lady you kept 

3880
02:33:55,951 --> 02:34:00,951
talking about earlier feels like she can
say those terrible things about you.

3881
02:34:02,250 --> 02:34:04,500
But she caught herself.
Yeah.

3882
02:34:04,560 --> 02:34:05,880
Yup.
And I wrote ugly.

3883
02:34:05,881 --> 02:34:07,170
Everything they're saying is projection.
I mean,

3884
02:34:07,171 --> 02:34:08,940
who's who's doing the abusing,
who's doing all of this?

3885
02:34:09,540 --> 02:34:11,070
It's not me.
You know,

3886
02:34:11,190 --> 02:34:12,810
it's,
none of this is really true.

3887
02:34:13,350 --> 02:34:14,400
But um,
yeah,

3888
02:34:14,420 --> 02:34:15,300
the,
the Islamic world,

3889
02:34:15,301 --> 02:34:16,200
the,
the well hobbies.

3890
02:34:16,470 --> 02:34:19,900
It was really,
I've read a fulsome fanaticism by Sunday

3891
02:34:19,900 --> 02:34:20,733
Ross Valentine and English professor who
went and lived down Saudi Arabia for 

3892
02:34:22,751 --> 02:34:24,970
three years to learn about the 
radiology.

3893
02:34:25,330 --> 02:34:25,930
Really,
really,

3894
02:34:25,930 --> 02:34:27,770
really fascinating.
Um,

3895
02:34:28,360 --> 02:34:29,193
one of the,
one of the most fascinating things is 

3896
02:34:30,191 --> 02:34:32,910
how much other Muslims don't like the 
hobbies.

3897
02:34:32,920 --> 02:34:36,660
And I'm using the term a hobby,
but it's,

3898
02:34:36,740 --> 02:34:40,600
it's a school of Islamic thought called 
Salafism and it can best be described as

3899
02:34:40,601 --> 02:34:41,770
autistic screeching.

3900
02:34:42,880 --> 02:34:46,150
It's like taking a really hard line 
interpretation,

3901
02:34:46,330 --> 02:34:49,810
ignoring other arguments against this 
line interpretation and going,

3902
02:34:49,811 --> 02:34:50,644
you know what,
just no,

3903
02:34:50,730 --> 02:34:51,563
not even listening.
And then just carrying on and seeing 

3904
02:34:52,991 --> 02:34:53,824
where that train of logic guests you and
suddenly it gets to religious police 

3905
02:34:56,141 --> 02:34:56,974
Sunday guess to throwing gays off 
buildings and stuff on the regular 

3906
02:34:58,931 --> 02:35:01,180
Muslims don't need to do because 
[inaudible] you know,

3907
02:35:01,181 --> 02:35:02,014
they'll be like,
well,

3908
02:35:02,290 --> 02:35:03,700
not pro gay.
I mean,

3909
02:35:04,090 --> 02:35:06,730
this is another ent,
but Mohammed says,

3910
02:35:06,731 --> 02:35:08,020
don't kill people,
you know,

3911
02:35:08,060 --> 02:35:10,240
at one point,
at some point in the Koran he says,

3912
02:35:10,241 --> 02:35:11,200
and so they,
they kind of say,

3913
02:35:11,201 --> 02:35:11,501
right,
okay,

3914
02:35:11,501 --> 02:35:13,240
well I'm not going to kill someone.
You know,

3915
02:35:13,241 --> 02:35:13,930
I mean,
okay,

3916
02:35:13,930 --> 02:35:14,763
maybe the gay thing was wrong.
So a lot of Muslims [inaudible] pro 

3917
02:35:16,720 --> 02:35:19,420
death centers for sexuality,
but you know,

3918
02:35:19,450 --> 02:35:19,930
the,
you know,

3919
02:35:19,930 --> 02:35:21,070
they'll have,
I mean,

3920
02:35:21,071 --> 02:35:23,350
everything's reasoned.
Everything is argumentation,

3921
02:35:23,460 --> 02:35:24,220
right?

3922
02:35:24,220 --> 02:35:25,053
And so the important thing is to 
understand that they are persuaded into 

3923
02:35:28,391 --> 02:35:31,240
becoming jehad jihadis.
And it's not,

3924
02:35:31,420 --> 02:35:33,520
and this is one thing the West has to 
understand.

3925
02:35:33,910 --> 02:35:36,850
It is not that we're at war with them,
right?

3926
02:35:37,420 --> 02:35:40,450
You can go to isis is like they,
they produce magazines.

3927
02:35:40,870 --> 02:35:42,730
Uh,
there was one called Dabiq,

3928
02:35:43,090 --> 02:35:46,540
which was a city,
they owned a but they lost it.

3929
02:35:46,541 --> 02:35:48,580
So they created a new one called 
[inaudible],

3930
02:35:48,640 --> 02:35:50,620
which is Rome,
what they,

3931
02:35:50,980 --> 02:35:53,830
Arabic for Rome that they have conquered
before and not isis,

3932
02:35:53,831 --> 02:35:56,780
but Islam and want to conquer again.
And then,

3933
02:35:56,781 --> 02:35:57,614
then they literally say in,
I can't really think it was like 

3934
02:35:59,800 --> 02:36:03,070
[inaudible] or something.
They literally turn around and say,

3935
02:36:03,370 --> 02:36:05,980
we do not fight you because your bond,
the Middle East,

3936
02:36:06,220 --> 02:36:09,160
we fight you because you are not Muslims
and no,

3937
02:36:09,340 --> 02:36:11,320
it's not because you bombed the Middle 
East.

3938
02:36:11,350 --> 02:36:12,183
Even if you stopped bombing Middle East,
we will fight you until we become 

3939
02:36:14,741 --> 02:36:15,370
Muslims.

3940
02:36:15,370 --> 02:36:17,440
This is why we do it.
Don't get me wrong,

3941
02:36:17,590 --> 02:36:19,900
you bombing the Middle East isn't making
us like you anymore.

3942
02:36:20,100 --> 02:36:23,470
You know we're going to keep doing it.
We find you because you insult Muhammad,

3943
02:36:23,500 --> 02:36:25,170
we find you because you don't believe in
allowing.

3944
02:36:25,180 --> 02:36:27,790
There's profit in the last day.
This is why we fight.

3945
02:36:27,791 --> 02:36:28,624
You do not misunderstand and they 
literally address the liberal or the 

3946
02:36:31,151 --> 02:36:33,160
progressive's or you know,
whatever you'd like to call them.

3947
02:36:33,400 --> 02:36:35,290
They're literally talking to these 
people saying,

3948
02:36:35,291 --> 02:36:37,450
don't think that we're crazy and we 
don't know.

3949
02:36:37,451 --> 02:36:39,070
We just,
this is what we believe.

3950
02:36:39,400 --> 02:36:42,550
You are cancer and we want to 
exterminate you basically,

3951
02:36:42,940 --> 02:36:45,220
and you get the sjws going.
Wow.

3952
02:36:45,221 --> 02:36:46,210
I mean,
it's kind of went bowling.

3953
02:36:46,211 --> 02:36:48,580
The music man,
American foreign policy knows nothing to

3954
02:36:48,581 --> 02:36:50,740
do with that.
It's all about the argumentation.

3955
02:36:51,010 --> 02:36:54,430
Even if we will just peaceful peace 
loving people who did nothing,

3956
02:36:54,730 --> 02:36:56,110
they would still be like,
well I lost,

3957
02:36:56,111 --> 02:36:57,010
told me to cut your head off.

3958
02:36:57,040 --> 02:36:57,873
I mean,
but again,

3959
02:36:58,030 --> 02:37:02,590
this is a small minority who are widely 
despised by other Muslims.

3960
02:37:02,591 --> 02:37:03,424
I mean the like for example,
if you went to a Christian school and 

3961
02:37:05,921 --> 02:37:08,350
everyone would probably be fairly chill,
you know,

3962
02:37:08,530 --> 02:37:09,550
you still going to like,
you know,

3963
02:37:09,560 --> 02:37:11,930
Catholic school or something and most 
people you talk to,

3964
02:37:11,940 --> 02:37:12,773
they'll be fairly chill.
But in every group of people you'd have 

3965
02:37:14,681 --> 02:37:15,514
a couple people who would be the sort of
people watching you and if you start 

3966
02:37:18,321 --> 02:37:20,500
doing something,
they'd go and get the nuns and,

3967
02:37:20,501 --> 02:37:21,560
and they,
and they get whack,

3968
02:37:21,561 --> 02:37:22,540
you know,
a day,

3969
02:37:22,550 --> 02:37:26,450
you know that they are those people.
It's just for Islam.

3970
02:37:26,810 --> 02:37:29,690
They ended up going and killing things 
because in Islam you told right,

3971
02:37:29,691 --> 02:37:30,830
if you,
if you die,

3972
02:37:30,831 --> 02:37:32,360
and this is another thing that drives me
crazy,

3973
02:37:32,560 --> 02:37:33,290
they're like,
oh,

3974
02:37:33,290 --> 02:37:35,810
the nine 11 hijackers with drinking and 
carousing and,

3975
02:37:36,020 --> 02:37:38,060
and doing drugs,
they're obviously not real Muslims now.

3976
02:37:38,060 --> 02:37:38,893
You fucking idiots.
They think they're having all of their 

3977
02:37:41,451 --> 02:37:45,320
sins expunged the second they die in the
surface of a lot.

3978
02:37:45,321 --> 02:37:48,380
This is what martyrdom is.
No matter what you've done,

3979
02:37:48,590 --> 02:37:53,590
you go to heaven and get your virgin.
So why wouldn't you do whatever the fuck

3980
02:37:54,681 --> 02:37:55,514
you like?
They have a free pass because they know 

3981
02:37:56,291 --> 02:37:57,740
they've got a day.
Exactly.

3982
02:37:57,741 --> 02:37:59,960
So that's what they do.
And so when they're like,

3983
02:37:59,990 --> 02:38:00,830
oh,
isis aren't ready,

3984
02:38:00,831 --> 02:38:02,600
Islamic cause look at they're doing at 
least on his long things.

3985
02:38:02,601 --> 02:38:04,510
No,
they know they're going to die and they,

3986
02:38:04,550 --> 02:38:05,383
well yeah,
in the logic of the theology that they 

3987
02:38:07,581 --> 02:38:08,640
live under,
um,

3988
02:38:08,690 --> 02:38:09,523
they think they get,
they're going to die and that they're 

3989
02:38:10,821 --> 02:38:13,610
going to get out of rescinded Alyson 
remission of sins.

3990
02:38:13,670 --> 02:38:14,503
Isn't that the most fascinating?
Part of it is just the things that 

3991
02:38:16,521 --> 02:38:19,910
people are willing to believe 
[inaudible] had been rezoned into it by.

3992
02:38:20,150 --> 02:38:21,170
If you take like say,
right,

3993
02:38:21,171 --> 02:38:23,780
I believe that the crime is the word of 
God and I believe that her deaths in the

3994
02:38:23,781 --> 02:38:24,614
center of the actual sayings and doings 
of the habit and you believe these 

3995
02:38:27,141 --> 02:38:32,120
things true then then you're building 
from certain base and you need to,

3996
02:38:32,160 --> 02:38:32,993
and basically it's how you construct 
arguments and if you start leaving out 

3997
02:38:35,151 --> 02:38:35,984
parts of what otherwise is like a 
regular Muslim sort of theological 

3998
02:38:39,651 --> 02:38:40,630
argument,
um,

3999
02:38:40,940 --> 02:38:42,920
then you ended up building like a weird 
tower over here.

4000
02:38:42,921 --> 02:38:44,070
This starts going off.
You know,

4001
02:38:44,120 --> 02:38:44,953
the arguments are constructing 
themselves off to the left rather than 

4002
02:38:47,541 --> 02:38:48,770
staying reasonably central.
I mean,

4003
02:38:48,771 --> 02:38:49,604
like most Muslims are never going to 
become terrorists because they don't 

4004
02:38:51,710 --> 02:38:52,543
artistically believe that a bunch of 
things just aren't true just because 

4005
02:38:54,831 --> 02:38:56,540
they don't want them to be true.
You know,

4006
02:38:56,541 --> 02:38:57,374
they don't,
they're not cherry picking from the 

4007
02:38:58,071 --> 02:38:58,904
Koran as much as the way to the extent 
that the wahabiists or Salafis and they 

4008
02:39:03,651 --> 02:39:04,320
will build it in general.

4009
02:39:04,320 --> 02:39:05,600
Do y'all know they,
they hate,

4010
02:39:05,750 --> 02:39:08,810
do you know what the watchword is,
is the dumbest thing in the world?

4011
02:39:09,680 --> 02:39:13,940
There'll be no more innovations wide.
No more innovations.

4012
02:39:14,330 --> 02:39:17,480
Mohammed was the perfect man.
We must live like Mohammed.

4013
02:39:17,840 --> 02:39:18,740
Therefore,
I mean like you,

4014
02:39:18,741 --> 02:39:21,510
you would not believe how dumb this is.
You,

4015
02:39:22,000 --> 02:39:24,320
this is really part of their doctrine.
Yes.

4016
02:39:24,350 --> 02:39:28,850
It's called Bita.
He'd be bid a,

4017
02:39:28,910 --> 02:39:30,650
I think it might have an h on it.
I'm not sure.

4018
02:39:31,030 --> 02:39:32,270
Uh,
but I don't speak Arabic.

4019
02:39:32,450 --> 02:39:34,870
And the idea is that there are no 
vacation,

4020
02:39:34,880 --> 02:39:36,620
not have any innovation.
No.

4021
02:39:36,920 --> 02:39:38,540
What about the innovation that they 
already use?

4022
02:39:38,541 --> 02:39:39,830
Like Toyota trucks?
Yeah,

4023
02:39:39,940 --> 02:39:40,311
the,
the,

4024
02:39:40,311 --> 02:39:41,144
the like for example,
the King King of sound had a hell of a 

4025
02:39:43,251 --> 02:39:44,690
time.
Right?

4026
02:39:44,691 --> 02:39:45,524
Okay.
So Saudi Arabia was founded by the even 

4027
02:39:48,291 --> 02:39:52,280
sowed family in conjunction with Abdul 
Hub.

4028
02:39:52,580 --> 02:39:56,390
It was a known in light,
the late 18th century.

4029
02:39:56,780 --> 02:40:00,530
Uh,
he was unknown a theologian and he was,

4030
02:40:00,531 --> 02:40:01,970
he was a brilliant man,
but he was,

4031
02:40:02,570 --> 02:40:04,820
I come from a better way of putting it 
in an autistic because he,

4032
02:40:05,120 --> 02:40:06,350
he was,
he was very focused,

4033
02:40:06,351 --> 02:40:10,280
hyper focused on a single sort of stress
strand of thought and everything that he

4034
02:40:10,281 --> 02:40:12,470
thought was either black or white,
there was no gray in between.

4035
02:40:12,471 --> 02:40:13,740
Right.
I know I'm,

4036
02:40:13,770 --> 02:40:14,603
I mean,
I literally mean he may well have had 

4037
02:40:15,691 --> 02:40:16,580
autism,
right?

4038
02:40:16,750 --> 02:40:17,583
Just use it as an insult.
He may well have literally had awesome 

4039
02:40:19,561 --> 02:40:21,330
zero those,
either this or nothing at all.

4040
02:40:21,331 --> 02:40:24,240
You know?
And so he ends up building this theology

4041
02:40:24,241 --> 02:40:26,100
and it's not,
it's not bad.

4042
02:40:26,130 --> 02:40:26,701
Well,
I met,

4043
02:40:26,701 --> 02:40:28,200
and I know that's a little wrong with 
some of those not,

4044
02:40:28,201 --> 02:40:30,000
there's not bad.
It's not that,

4045
02:40:30,001 --> 02:40:30,834
it's not like,
it's not that there isn't an argument 

4046
02:40:32,491 --> 02:40:33,324
there.
There obviously must be an argument 

4047
02:40:34,111 --> 02:40:35,250
there,
otherwise people wouldn't believe it.

4048
02:40:35,310 --> 02:40:38,940
Right.
But you're getting me really confused.

4049
02:40:39,120 --> 02:40:39,953
Okay.
What might be an argument otherwise 

4050
02:40:40,921 --> 02:40:42,590
people won't believe what he's saying 
and the,

4051
02:40:42,591 --> 02:40:45,100
his interpretation of the Koran and 
Islam and you know,

4052
02:40:45,210 --> 02:40:47,640
all of this,
he's got a particular interpretation and

4053
02:40:47,641 --> 02:40:48,540
he says to someone,
Hey,

4054
02:40:48,541 --> 02:40:49,374
you should follow my interpretation of 
Islam cause I'm actually got the right 

4055
02:40:51,661 --> 02:40:53,370
interpretation of Islam.
Okay.

4056
02:40:53,910 --> 02:40:54,743
And,
uh,

4057
02:40:55,630 --> 02:40:57,120
and most people were like,
no,

4058
02:40:57,930 --> 02:40:59,310
you know,
you're,

4059
02:40:59,311 --> 02:41:01,080
you're ignoring almost everything,
you know,

4060
02:41:01,350 --> 02:41:02,183
and that's fine,
but what does that have to do with 

4061
02:41:03,391 --> 02:41:04,560
innovation?
Right.

4062
02:41:04,561 --> 02:41:06,270
Well,
that's the thing like Beeda is ha,

4063
02:41:06,300 --> 02:41:07,133
you know,
harmful innovations and but they don't 

4064
02:41:10,111 --> 02:41:12,330
run harmful innovations are bad by 
definition.

4065
02:41:12,570 --> 02:41:15,690
But there were also good innovations.
So the telephone,

4066
02:41:15,691 --> 02:41:16,321
you know,
the cars,

4067
02:41:16,321 --> 02:41:17,154
all that sort of stuff,
these kids are good innovations are so 

4068
02:41:18,750 --> 02:41:21,330
the Muslims are free to use them.
The hobbies,

4069
02:41:22,860 --> 02:41:23,693
I imagine now this point,
they've been persuaded that they are 

4070
02:41:25,440 --> 02:41:26,273
okay.

4071
02:41:26,490 --> 02:41:28,770
But um,
when like for example,

4072
02:41:28,800 --> 02:41:29,633
uh,
even salad first tried to explain to 

4073
02:41:31,321 --> 02:41:32,154
them,
look,

4074
02:41:32,430 --> 02:41:34,440
we need guns.
And you know,

4075
02:41:34,441 --> 02:41:35,274
we ended up at a maximum gun.
We planes we need when he bombs and 

4076
02:41:38,911 --> 02:41:39,744
bullets and cars,
all of these now televisions and 

4077
02:41:42,960 --> 02:41:44,520
satellite dishes and all the sorts of 
thing.

4078
02:41:45,000 --> 02:41:47,910
They were actively resistant to this 
because of the whole,

4079
02:41:47,911 --> 02:41:52,020
Mohammed didn't have this and he had 
these things called I warriors.

4080
02:41:52,050 --> 02:41:54,680
I'm probably pronouncing that horribly.
So apologies.

4081
02:41:54,690 --> 02:41:55,523
Anyone who knows how to pronounce these 
words cause I haven't ever seen written 

4082
02:41:57,331 --> 02:41:58,440
down.
Um,

4083
02:41:58,500 --> 02:42:00,880
but these guys were like Isis,
the,

4084
02:42:00,890 --> 02:42:01,560
the,
I mean,

4085
02:42:01,560 --> 02:42:05,640
the way Saudi Arabia was formed is 
exactly the same way as isis has been.

4086
02:42:05,700 --> 02:42:08,400
The Islamic state has been formed now.
Exactly the same.

4087
02:42:08,401 --> 02:42:10,350
These guys were the most brutal man 
you've ever seen.

4088
02:42:10,770 --> 02:42:12,690
And they would just go in and murder 
entire villages,

4089
02:42:12,720 --> 02:42:13,290
right.

4090
02:42:13,290 --> 02:42:15,450
He had 150,000
of these people,

4091
02:42:15,750 --> 02:42:16,950
you know,
like that.

4092
02:42:16,951 --> 02:42:18,990
He used to conquer what is now Saudi 
Arabia.

4093
02:42:19,320 --> 02:42:22,860
And eventually he was like,
I want a car.

4094
02:42:24,210 --> 02:42:25,560
I think planes,
good idea.

4095
02:42:25,710 --> 02:42:26,543
And they were like,
no,

4096
02:42:26,730 --> 02:42:28,380
no.
And so they revolted against him.

4097
02:42:28,650 --> 02:42:29,483
And the British seeing him as a useful 
client decided to help him out with a 

4098
02:42:33,061 --> 02:42:34,550
few macs and guns and if you'd like,
you know,

4099
02:42:34,630 --> 02:42:35,463
biplanes or something.
So they revolted against him because he 

4100
02:42:37,381 --> 02:42:38,760
wanted a car.
Yeah,

4101
02:42:38,790 --> 02:42:40,310
because it's on Islamic Ma'am and 
Nevada.

4102
02:42:40,380 --> 02:42:41,770
A,
uh,

4103
02:42:42,360 --> 02:42:45,900
the British killed mill,
which was probably,

4104
02:42:45,910 --> 02:42:46,743
honestly,
it was probably a good thing for the 

4105
02:42:47,311 --> 02:42:48,300
world.
Don't get me wrong,

4106
02:42:48,301 --> 02:42:50,580
because these guys were nuts.
They would regularly just,

4107
02:42:50,610 --> 02:42:51,800
I mean,
and this is the thing that,

4108
02:42:51,850 --> 02:42:54,390
it's another thing they've got is the 
tech theory doctrine.

4109
02:42:54,630 --> 02:42:57,480
You're not a real Muslim.
That's an interesting thing,

4110
02:42:57,481 --> 02:42:58,230
isn't it?

4111
02:42:58,230 --> 02:43:00,270
And it's,
it's interesting how we do that to them.

4112
02:43:00,570 --> 02:43:01,403
We tack fear them.
You're not a real must be the wind on a 

4113
02:43:03,691 --> 02:43:05,730
position to tell anyone who's a real 
Muslim or not.

4114
02:43:06,150 --> 02:43:06,983
You know,
if they consider themselves Muslims and 

4115
02:43:07,941 --> 02:43:08,774
Muslim and let me,
they like literally they are the most 

4116
02:43:10,381 --> 02:43:12,430
Muslim in their opinion and their 
opinion.

4117
02:43:12,431 --> 02:43:15,580
Nobody else's a real Muslim and 
therefore it's okay to kill them.

4118
02:43:15,610 --> 02:43:16,443
You can only,
you only have to give a shit about 

4119
02:43:17,950 --> 02:43:20,260
actual Muslims under this doctrine.
Again,

4120
02:43:20,290 --> 02:43:21,123
this is not what most Muslims think.
This is the antithesis of what most 

4121
02:43:23,291 --> 02:43:27,070
Muslims actually think.
And so these guys used to like in a huge

4122
02:43:27,090 --> 02:43:30,790
rating that you have to qualify that.
Like you have to stand up and say,

4123
02:43:30,820 --> 02:43:31,653
I know,
you know the other nutty shit is not as 

4124
02:43:33,000 --> 02:43:34,630
naughty as this nutty shit.
Yeah.

4125
02:43:34,631 --> 02:43:35,464
And,
and just just while we're on the 

4126
02:43:35,981 --> 02:43:37,060
subject,
right?

4127
02:43:37,240 --> 02:43:38,073
Islam is Towsley in liberal,
a Western liberal country should never 

4128
02:43:42,041 --> 02:43:45,610
defend Islam in it's,
this sounds very islamophobic of you.

4129
02:43:45,611 --> 02:43:47,330
Exactly.
And it's been used a lot.

4130
02:43:47,360 --> 02:43:48,910
Phobic comps and Louis,
I would never,

4131
02:43:48,911 --> 02:43:51,310
I would hate you would hate to live in 
Sharia law.

4132
02:43:51,550 --> 02:43:52,660
Well,
you might not want,

4133
02:43:52,661 --> 02:43:53,494
not you personally,
but as a man you would to an entirely 

4134
02:43:55,451 --> 02:43:57,130
benefit from living on the shelf for 
real.

4135
02:43:57,131 --> 02:43:57,964
How so?
The girls have to walk around like 

4136
02:43:59,021 --> 02:44:00,100
beekeepers,
right?

4137
02:44:00,550 --> 02:44:02,770
Not always that.
That's actually not,

4138
02:44:02,771 --> 02:44:04,390
how do you know what they really look?
That's actually,

4139
02:44:04,391 --> 02:44:06,820
that's actually not in the Koran.
It just says be modest.

4140
02:44:06,821 --> 02:44:08,210
Right.
You know,

4141
02:44:08,230 --> 02:44:10,750
you could just wear a headscarf,
isn't it?

4142
02:44:10,780 --> 02:44:14,020
If you like an internet,
Ho monist is like chance shorts.

4143
02:44:14,021 --> 02:44:14,800
Yeah.
And if you're,

4144
02:44:14,800 --> 02:44:15,633
if you're an autistic isis member that's
full on burger with a grill of your 

4145
02:44:18,851 --> 02:44:19,120
face.

4146
02:44:19,120 --> 02:44:19,953
So this,
what's interesting about this 

4147
02:44:20,480 --> 02:44:22,030
conversation,
the,

4148
02:44:22,160 --> 02:44:25,420
the thing would be like for example,
in the legal system,

4149
02:44:25,540 --> 02:44:27,610
directly out to the Quran,
women,

4150
02:44:27,640 --> 02:44:31,010
a woman's testimony is worth half of a 
man's in the legal system,

4151
02:44:31,030 --> 02:44:31,863
in the legal,
so that they use that legal system like 

4152
02:44:33,521 --> 02:44:36,790
they use the Koran forced the losses.
It's based on sharia.

4153
02:44:36,820 --> 02:44:38,830
So if a woman says something like,
Oh,

4154
02:44:38,831 --> 02:44:42,700
Sargon raped me and you'd be like,
pitch and we need a female witness.

4155
02:44:42,701 --> 02:44:44,060
Yeah,
he has two point you didn't,

4156
02:44:44,061 --> 02:44:45,560
you'd need more than one.
You know,

4157
02:44:45,570 --> 02:44:47,210
we did another female witness to testify
it.

4158
02:44:47,211 --> 02:44:49,890
Yeah.
And even then it was pop by,

4159
02:44:50,430 --> 02:44:52,570
she had a half a woman for the west of 
that.

4160
02:44:52,710 --> 02:44:53,543
This is entirely,
entirely possible that the judge would 

4161
02:44:54,781 --> 02:44:56,590
punish her for tempting me.
Yeah.

4162
02:44:56,591 --> 02:44:59,930
Because like if she has a half an 
opinion and then the other chickens that

4163
02:44:59,940 --> 02:45:02,260
half an opinion,
that's still only like one person.

4164
02:45:03,040 --> 02:45:04,270
One person's a woman.
Yeah.

4165
02:45:04,271 --> 02:45:05,104
This one's for the whole thing.
I mean about women are entitled to half 

4166
02:45:06,431 --> 02:45:08,930
of the inheritance money managers and 
title.

4167
02:45:09,560 --> 02:45:12,680
That was the other half go to the any 
brothers will,

4168
02:45:12,730 --> 02:45:15,650
you know anything like that.
If you're a lone sibling then you,

4169
02:45:15,651 --> 02:45:16,810
okay.
That was my only child then.

4170
02:45:16,820 --> 02:45:18,100
Yeah,
you're fine obviously.

4171
02:45:18,430 --> 02:45:21,040
But like if you've got a male sibling,
you'll get half of what he goes.

4172
02:45:21,670 --> 02:45:24,160
Pretty horrible isn't it?
But yeah.

4173
02:45:24,161 --> 02:45:25,520
And this is just like the most moral 
thing.

4174
02:45:25,521 --> 02:45:26,354
And like the legal system is basically 
about a bounce as useful as Hammurabi's 

4175
02:45:30,821 --> 02:45:33,130
code of laws where you know,
an eye for an eye tooth for a tooth.

4176
02:45:33,420 --> 02:45:37,200
I mean that was outdated 2000 years ago 
in West,

4177
02:45:37,560 --> 02:45:38,950
you know with the infant Jesus.
It's been,

4178
02:45:38,960 --> 02:45:39,311
no,
no,

4179
02:45:39,311 --> 02:45:39,911
it is.
Let me see.

4180
02:45:39,911 --> 02:45:40,744
It's,
it's really brutal stuff and it's just 

4181
02:45:41,591 --> 02:45:42,970
like,
okay,

4182
02:45:42,971 --> 02:45:43,804
well I mean any progressive,
whoever advocates for anything positive 

4183
02:45:48,520 --> 02:45:51,160
about Islam is an idiot and doesn't 
understand Islam.

4184
02:45:51,520 --> 02:45:52,360
They've got,
I mean I've,

4185
02:45:52,361 --> 02:45:54,820
I've seen them going Islams,
ms feminist religion.

4186
02:45:54,850 --> 02:45:55,683
Yeah.
If you want to be made a second class 

4187
02:45:56,111 --> 02:45:57,280
citizen,
it is absolutely.

4188
02:45:57,400 --> 02:45:58,233
If that's what you want feminism to be,
the installation of a systemic 

4189
02:46:01,810 --> 02:46:03,850
oppression against women.
Sure.

4190
02:46:04,450 --> 02:46:05,283
That can be feminism if you like.
And that really is revealing about 

4191
02:46:07,391 --> 02:46:08,224
feminism,
isn't it?

4192
02:46:08,260 --> 02:46:10,340
What is going lately with this

4193
02:46:10,430 --> 02:46:15,020
weird sort of acceptance of,
how do you say,

4194
02:46:15,021 --> 02:46:17,690
Hey job,
how do you say that the head gear head,

4195
02:46:17,740 --> 02:46:19,130
you know,
offends me more than anything.

4196
02:46:19,131 --> 02:46:21,140
Right.
But what's going on with that?

4197
02:46:21,380 --> 02:46:24,440
There's this weird thing where women are
like being empowered.

4198
02:46:24,470 --> 02:46:27,290
They're pretend I'm the fuck up,
but they're pretending they're empowered

4199
02:46:27,291 --> 02:46:28,940
by this and that this is their own 
choice.

4200
02:46:29,600 --> 02:46:31,910
This is a feminist value.
Unbelievably stupid,

4201
02:46:31,930 --> 02:46:33,750
but very common.
If you seen it.

4202
02:46:35,000 --> 02:46:36,440
One thing that I,
I've never,

4203
02:46:36,890 --> 02:46:38,930
I never really saw myself as sole person
who gets offended,

4204
02:46:38,931 --> 02:46:40,940
but when I see an American flag,
his job,

4205
02:46:41,150 --> 02:46:42,890
I find that offense come on.
They have those.

4206
02:46:42,920 --> 02:46:44,390
Oh yeah,
I know.

4207
02:46:44,391 --> 02:46:45,260
I let you look at and get,
no,

4208
02:46:45,261 --> 02:46:47,340
this is the antithesis of what these 
files.

4209
02:46:48,320 --> 02:46:49,850
That seems like something a biker would 
wear.

4210
02:46:50,740 --> 02:46:53,420
It sounds like.
It sounds like a parody,

4211
02:46:53,570 --> 02:46:55,850
but then American,
that's really what it is.

4212
02:46:55,940 --> 02:46:58,350
Maybe like one of them duck dynasty 
phase.

4213
02:46:58,380 --> 02:46:59,160
Maybe.
Maybe.

4214
02:46:59,160 --> 02:47:00,110
Maybe.
Maybe.

4215
02:47:00,111 --> 02:47:00,944
I've been fooled.
Oh my God is not just the symbol of 

4216
02:47:03,501 --> 02:47:04,850
liberty.
Cover yourself up.

4217
02:47:07,300 --> 02:47:08,890
Wow.

4218
02:47:09,070 --> 02:47:10,860
Cover your fucking hair up.
You.

4219
02:47:11,360 --> 02:47:14,320
So she,
she wearing that to show that she's very

4220
02:47:14,321 --> 02:47:18,610
American when trump is saying that he 
wants to shut down mosques.

4221
02:47:18,611 --> 02:47:20,920
Yeah.
Did you see that whole Megan Kelly thing

4222
02:47:20,921 --> 02:47:23,580
with Alex Jones?
I saw that a,

4223
02:47:23,590 --> 02:47:25,990
he scooped a,
but to be fair,

4224
02:47:25,991 --> 02:47:26,824
I mean Alex probably did say a lot of 
crazy shit and he'd probably say they 

4225
02:47:28,781 --> 02:47:30,160
live by a little crazy shit,
didn't they?

4226
02:47:30,370 --> 02:47:31,540
Well,
he's in the past.

4227
02:47:31,541 --> 02:47:34,390
He said definitely some crazy shit about
sandy hook and,

4228
02:47:34,391 --> 02:47:37,240
but she was saying he never expected to 
ever be famous.

4229
02:47:38,170 --> 02:47:40,300
Uh,
I've known Alex A.

4230
02:47:40,300 --> 02:47:42,430
Long time.
It's not that,

4231
02:47:42,700 --> 02:47:44,670
it's just that he's just the build a 
budget,

4232
02:47:44,950 --> 02:47:45,783
always looking for conspiracies.
Like when you think you know for sure 

4233
02:47:49,511 --> 02:47:50,344
that some things for sure that some a 
conspiracy when you don't really know 

4234
02:47:52,721 --> 02:47:53,554
for sure.
You're just saying it and then you just 

4235
02:47:55,121 --> 02:47:55,954
run with it.

4236
02:47:56,200 --> 02:47:58,060
When you're talking about children's 
lives,

4237
02:47:58,061 --> 02:48:00,520
it's very dangerous.
It's a horrible,

4238
02:48:00,970 --> 02:48:04,270
you better have some bloody convincing 
proof and he's abandoned.

4239
02:48:04,900 --> 02:48:05,960
Abandoned that.
Yeah.

4240
02:48:05,961 --> 02:48:09,460
But he hasn't abandoned it and apologize
for saying it.

4241
02:48:10,120 --> 02:48:12,580
He's like the,
what he's done is like made this sort of

4242
02:48:12,581 --> 02:48:13,414
like,
uh,

4243
02:48:13,560 --> 02:48:17,620
he's,
he's sort of like made some,

4244
02:48:18,340 --> 02:48:19,173
some,
some video where he's talking to the 

4245
02:48:22,121 --> 02:48:26,470
parents directly and saying that he 
couldn't imagine he feels their pain and

4246
02:48:26,471 --> 02:48:28,930
I'm terrible for,
I feel very sorry for your loss,

4247
02:48:29,440 --> 02:48:32,890
but it doesn't go saying,
I'm sorry I supported a hoax.

4248
02:48:33,220 --> 02:48:34,053
That's not true.
That says you were liars and your 

4249
02:48:36,101 --> 02:48:37,270
children were never killed.
Yeah.

4250
02:48:37,600 --> 02:48:38,433
You know,
there was a really crazy story that I 

4251
02:48:39,281 --> 02:48:40,114
read about a guy who was a conspiracy 
theorist and then his own son was 

4252
02:48:43,271 --> 02:48:45,880
murdered and then he realized,
Holy Shit,

4253
02:48:46,270 --> 02:48:48,250
in Sandy Hook,
he realized like,

4254
02:48:48,251 --> 02:48:49,084
Oh my God,
this is how insane these conspiracy 

4255
02:48:50,891 --> 02:48:51,724
theories are.

4256
02:48:52,030 --> 02:48:53,110
There's people that are,
that are,

4257
02:48:53,111 --> 02:48:53,944
there's a whole movement right now where
they think that polio was a massive 

4258
02:48:57,630 --> 02:49:02,630
hopes and that what polio was,
was them injecting people with the polio

4259
02:49:03,551 --> 02:49:07,950
vaccine because there was no polio and 
then injecting with as the vaccine,

4260
02:49:07,951 --> 02:49:11,190
they hurt all these people.
As someone who has been fooled before,

4261
02:49:11,191 --> 02:49:12,990
I can tell you the,
any solution is education.

4262
02:49:13,040 --> 02:49:13,680
You've got.
Yeah.

4263
02:49:13,680 --> 02:49:14,513
You can't just,
you can't just tell these people that 

4264
02:49:15,441 --> 02:49:17,520
are idiots and never told to them cause 
they'll just think,

4265
02:49:17,521 --> 02:49:19,760
well you don't have anything to rebut me
with Flatiron,

4266
02:49:19,770 --> 02:49:20,161
right?
Yeah,

4267
02:49:20,161 --> 02:49:20,791
exactly.
The floods,

4268
02:49:20,791 --> 02:49:22,080
you've got engaged with these people.
I mean,

4269
02:49:22,081 --> 02:49:25,830
that's way it'd be popular these days.
It's like what the fuck do you think the

4270
02:49:25,831 --> 02:49:28,540
satellites are for?
Why put that Elan Musk thing up and they

4271
02:49:28,541 --> 02:49:30,570
seen that Ilan Mustang I put on 
instagram.

4272
02:49:30,580 --> 02:49:32,370
Should check this out,
pull this up.

4273
02:49:32,450 --> 02:49:36,600
Elon musk posted something about space x
and now they're there.

4274
02:49:36,660 --> 02:49:37,493
They're shooting.
They can shoot something in the space 

4275
02:49:38,611 --> 02:49:42,240
now and then land it on a pad and 
figured out how to do that.

4276
02:49:42,241 --> 02:49:46,800
And so they sped up a sped up version.
So instead of taking an hour or whatever

4277
02:49:46,801 --> 02:49:49,170
it takes to get up there and get back.
But check this out.

4278
02:49:49,171 --> 02:49:51,780
Like look how beautiful that looks when 
they come in down in the earth,

4279
02:49:52,020 --> 02:49:54,470
but then go watch.
But why doesn't the world full of joy?

4280
02:49:55,380 --> 02:49:57,350
I don't know,
but check this out the water.

4281
02:49:57,660 --> 02:50:01,410
It does.
So watch how this thing lands.

4282
02:50:01,411 --> 02:50:04,230
This is really kind of crazy.
Boom.

4283
02:50:04,380 --> 02:50:06,600
From that nuts fucking out,
right?

4284
02:50:06,630 --> 02:50:07,830
Yeah.
That's incredible dude.

4285
02:50:07,890 --> 02:50:10,230
Elon Musk for president.
Wow.

4286
02:50:10,290 --> 02:50:12,100
I didn't know about his politics but I 
mean that's,

4287
02:50:12,460 --> 02:50:13,890
you know,
must've built shit.

4288
02:50:13,970 --> 02:50:14,803
It's amazing.
But look at that fucking video of the 

4289
02:50:17,400 --> 02:50:18,120
earth.

4290
02:50:18,120 --> 02:50:18,953
So all these dip shits in the comments.
I knew I was going to put it up cause 

4291
02:50:23,881 --> 02:50:25,680
it's awesome.
It's awesome.

4292
02:50:25,681 --> 02:50:26,514
I'm going to put it up,
whether or not dipshits think the earth 

4293
02:50:28,231 --> 02:50:29,250
is flat or not,
but it's,

4294
02:50:29,251 --> 02:50:34,200
you clearly see the fucking circle these
to the curve of the earth and um,

4295
02:50:34,380 --> 02:50:35,213
there's so many people in the comments 
so you could see George Foods really 

4296
02:50:37,441 --> 02:50:38,071
believed that.
Bro,

4297
02:50:38,071 --> 02:50:40,640
you're such a solo show out,
bro.

4298
02:50:40,710 --> 02:50:42,480
Why do we have satellites?
What's the point?

4299
02:50:42,481 --> 02:50:44,760
I mean there's no salary.
They don't think their satellites,

4300
02:50:44,790 --> 02:50:46,410
but you can see them loans you've done?
No,

4301
02:50:46,600 --> 02:50:46,771
no,
no,

4302
02:50:46,771 --> 02:50:47,604
no,
no,

4303
02:50:47,700 --> 02:50:50,010
no.
They're flying around in planes.

4304
02:50:50,130 --> 02:50:50,963
Okay.
Why can't you see the sun at anytime of 

4305
02:50:51,751 --> 02:50:53,850
the day or night?
Why can't you?

4306
02:50:53,900 --> 02:50:54,733
Yeah,
because the sun goes around behind the 

4307
02:50:55,801 --> 02:50:57,540
flat earth.
No,

4308
02:50:59,580 --> 02:51:02,470
it doesn't make any sense.
Why are you saying it like,

4309
02:51:02,790 --> 02:51:05,020
like you were looking for a rational 
explanation,

4310
02:51:05,220 --> 02:51:05,910
but that's the thing,
isn't it?

4311
02:51:05,910 --> 02:51:07,220
Because if let's say,
you know,

4312
02:51:07,221 --> 02:51:08,640
this is the flood,
the ice wall,

4313
02:51:09,450 --> 02:51:12,270
they say about it like it's like a under
like a fucking,

4314
02:51:12,600 --> 02:51:13,500
like a spotlight.
Right?

4315
02:51:13,501 --> 02:51:15,270
And it's for some reason rotating around
it,

4316
02:51:15,271 --> 02:51:15,810
but it's like,
well,

4317
02:51:15,810 --> 02:51:16,910
at any point I should be able to put it 
in.

4318
02:51:16,930 --> 02:51:19,320
Got to look at this.
The Sun is just shining downwards.

4319
02:51:19,321 --> 02:51:20,154
You know,
you have a poor understanding of flat 

4320
02:51:21,721 --> 02:51:22,501
earth theory,
sir.

4321
02:51:22,501 --> 02:51:24,180
I think I probably do.
It's all that is.

4322
02:51:24,181 --> 02:51:25,100
You're absolutely right.
But yeah,

4323
02:51:25,140 --> 02:51:27,510
the only way to,
any way to get rid of these things,

4324
02:51:27,511 --> 02:51:30,030
just to educate people you can't 
ridicule because they're not,

4325
02:51:30,060 --> 02:51:31,380
they're not necessarily being 
irrational,

4326
02:51:31,500 --> 02:51:34,020
that just dumb.
But it's like everything else.

4327
02:51:34,021 --> 02:51:34,854
We've talked about what people have an 
idea in their head and then they dig 

4328
02:51:37,261 --> 02:51:39,480
their heels in the sand.
And here's the thing.

4329
02:51:39,660 --> 02:51:42,270
Once you've publicly said you think the 
earth is flat,

4330
02:51:43,810 --> 02:51:47,700
and once you've said that,
like you have to sort of stick with your

4331
02:51:47,701 --> 02:51:48,380
guns.

4332
02:51:48,380 --> 02:51:49,500
Well,
cause if you come out and say,

4333
02:51:49,501 --> 02:51:51,780
I'm sorry,
I'm so stupid.

4334
02:51:51,810 --> 02:51:54,510
I really did believe these fucking 
idiots on youtube.

4335
02:51:54,540 --> 02:51:57,090
Instead of believing actual 
astrophysicist,

4336
02:51:57,270 --> 02:52:00,450
actual people who were involved in the 
fields of cartography,

4337
02:52:00,451 --> 02:52:02,310
airline travel,
shipping routes.

4338
02:52:02,760 --> 02:52:03,593
I mean Jesus fucking Christ.
You can go on and on and on about 

4339
02:52:05,501 --> 02:52:06,820
satellites,
aerospace,

4340
02:52:06,821 --> 02:52:07,654
engineering,
all the different people that probably 

4341
02:52:10,181 --> 02:52:11,014
would have to be in cahoots.
And let me tell you about the wall of 

4342
02:52:13,121 --> 02:52:13,954
ice.
The walls,

4343
02:52:14,140 --> 02:52:15,910
there's a photo of it.
Someone sent to me.

4344
02:52:15,911 --> 02:52:17,770
You fucking idiot.
There's the wall.

4345
02:52:17,920 --> 02:52:21,250
It's like it's 10 feet high.
That's a good piece of shit.

4346
02:52:21,670 --> 02:52:25,300
I watched the video by some,
by some of the Youtube App and uh,

4347
02:52:26,350 --> 02:52:28,150
some here too.
Like the problem man,

4348
02:52:28,151 --> 02:52:30,640
fucking youtubers is a law.
It is a part of the bone.

4349
02:52:30,641 --> 02:52:31,630
But when he,
he was like,

4350
02:52:31,631 --> 02:52:33,040
why do we believe in a flat earth?

4351
02:52:33,540 --> 02:52:36,490
And I was great.
I want to know,

4352
02:52:36,491 --> 02:52:38,280
you know,
that was legitimately exact scenes.

4353
02:52:38,520 --> 02:52:40,940
One Chem trails.
Actually it was the hope big.

4354
02:52:40,950 --> 02:52:42,010
It was like this.
It gives us,

4355
02:52:42,090 --> 02:52:44,350
I remember we'll talk about big foot.
It's a hope.

4356
02:52:44,351 --> 02:52:45,640
They get it home.
It gives them hope,

4357
02:52:45,641 --> 02:52:46,474
like hope beyond the,
the ice wall that are better land 

4358
02:52:48,941 --> 02:52:49,661
exists.
And it's like,

4359
02:52:49,661 --> 02:52:51,130
why would it be any better than what 
we've got now?

4360
02:52:51,880 --> 02:52:53,500
Don't you have a photo?
You'd dump cons.

4361
02:52:53,560 --> 02:52:56,620
It's not one guy leaked to fucking 
camera over to that ice wall.

4362
02:52:56,621 --> 02:52:58,470
You piece of shit.
Can we fly a drone over?

4363
02:52:58,720 --> 02:53:00,790
Show me that edge.
Showing the outside.

4364
02:53:00,791 --> 02:53:01,624
It's why,
why it looks a conspiracy to keep 

4365
02:53:03,461 --> 02:53:05,560
hidden.
No can was what it is.

4366
02:53:05,710 --> 02:53:10,060
People love to know things that other 
people don't know.

4367
02:53:10,090 --> 02:53:10,923
They love when they uncovered truth.
When there's a secret that someone is 

4368
02:53:14,531 --> 02:53:17,920
hiding about something as monumental as 
the shape of the earth.

4369
02:53:18,160 --> 02:53:20,020
People love to be the people in the 
know.

4370
02:53:20,021 --> 02:53:24,640
They love to be Hashtag woke that's what
happens.

4371
02:53:25,030 --> 02:53:27,130
And they don't like to read books.
No,

4372
02:53:27,131 --> 02:53:27,521
no,
no,

4373
02:53:27,521 --> 02:53:29,290
they don't.
And I think for some of them though,

4374
02:53:29,650 --> 02:53:30,483
like it,
I mean this guy who was saying that it 

4375
02:53:31,391 --> 02:53:35,050
gives us hope and he's like,
that's because you don't have any hope.

4376
02:53:35,051 --> 02:53:37,090
You need something and you're honestly 
not a religious person.

4377
02:53:37,330 --> 02:53:39,220
And so you take on this as kind of a 
religious belief.

4378
02:53:39,250 --> 02:53:39,640
You,
no,

4379
02:53:39,640 --> 02:53:40,330
no,
you're wrong.

4380
02:53:40,330 --> 02:53:41,590
Listen,
a lot of them are religious.

4381
02:53:41,591 --> 02:53:42,424
That's part of the thing.
Part of the whole thing is that 

4382
02:53:44,171 --> 02:53:45,004
evolution is a lie.
That's one of the big parts of flat 

4383
02:53:47,171 --> 02:53:48,004
earth theory is that the earth is flat.
The firmament breaking the conditioning 

4384
02:53:51,100 --> 02:53:51,761
today.
Yeah,

4385
02:53:51,761 --> 02:53:52,594
man.
Listen is a big religious part of this 

4386
02:53:54,641 --> 02:53:56,040
whole thing.
Evolution.

4387
02:53:56,041 --> 02:53:56,740
This is a lie.

4388
02:53:56,740 --> 02:54:01,660
It's a huge part of the flat earth 
movement is a belief in creationism.

4389
02:54:01,870 --> 02:54:06,040
I believe that whole space is not real 
and then above us is heaven.

4390
02:54:06,190 --> 02:54:08,350
That we live in a dome now.
This is,

4391
02:54:08,440 --> 02:54:11,050
there's a lot of different factions to 
the flat earth movement.

4392
02:54:11,051 --> 02:54:13,690
I'm sure that since,
Oh yes,

4393
02:54:13,691 --> 02:54:15,220
I have,
but no,

4394
02:54:15,221 --> 02:54:18,780
this is a big,
a big part of this is a deep belief in,

4395
02:54:18,940 --> 02:54:21,160
in creationism.
Oh,

4396
02:54:21,190 --> 02:54:23,320
so it's like it's an American Christine 
thing.

4397
02:54:23,350 --> 02:54:24,183
Oh yeah.
The ones who believe in it also don't 

4398
02:54:25,361 --> 02:54:28,450
believe in dinosaurs.
I think dinosaurs are fake.

4399
02:54:29,260 --> 02:54:30,310
This is wonderful,
right?

4400
02:54:30,580 --> 02:54:33,850
The main guy believes that dinosaurs are
fixed by the way.

4401
02:54:33,851 --> 02:54:34,271
Oh,
thanks.

4402
02:54:34,271 --> 02:54:36,610
Nuclear bombs or hoax.
Yes.

4403
02:54:36,611 --> 02:54:37,600
Nuclear bombs or,
oh,

4404
02:54:37,610 --> 02:54:38,570
what did we drop?
Bom,

4405
02:54:38,830 --> 02:54:40,200
Bom,
Bom Bom.

4406
02:54:40,300 --> 02:54:42,400
Not a big deal.
It's just a really a bomb.

4407
02:54:42,460 --> 02:54:43,750
Nuclear.
It's a hoax.

4408
02:54:44,180 --> 02:54:46,000
Yeah.
But this massive hoax,

4409
02:54:46,001 --> 02:54:47,040
they spent a lot of money.
It's just,

4410
02:54:47,130 --> 02:54:49,710
just really big.
Dinosaurs are hooks to bro.

4411
02:54:49,960 --> 02:54:50,793
Chem trails are real though.
Of course there probably could be real 

4412
02:54:55,541 --> 02:54:57,200
jail engineering is a thing.
Oh yeah.

4413
02:54:57,260 --> 02:54:58,960
Like,
and so it could actually be right.

4414
02:54:58,961 --> 02:54:59,794
And I could see the rationale from the 
government's point of view if they're 

4415
02:55:00,971 --> 02:55:01,591
like,
well,

4416
02:55:01,591 --> 02:55:03,980
a global warming is happening and if we 
like put extra

4417
02:55:03,980 --> 02:55:04,813
clouds in the sky,
then it'll deflect an excessive amount 

4418
02:55:07,581 --> 02:55:09,590
of the sun's rays and coolio if done 
well.

4419
02:55:09,591 --> 02:55:10,520
It does do that.
Yeah,

4420
02:55:10,521 --> 02:55:11,150
exactly.
So,

4421
02:55:11,150 --> 02:55:13,100
but it doesn't mean it was a conspiracy 
to do that.

4422
02:55:13,101 --> 02:55:14,160
That's why they're stupid.
But yeah,

4423
02:55:14,170 --> 02:55:15,080
it's no,
it's not the,

4424
02:55:15,120 --> 02:55:16,150
they're not trying to,
cause they,

4425
02:55:16,330 --> 02:55:17,300
you know,
I've seen the capture thing.

4426
02:55:17,301 --> 02:55:19,440
They think what they're trying to like 
poison people do.

4427
02:55:19,450 --> 02:55:23,720
So from our stand that that's what 
happens when a jet engine goes through.

4428
02:55:23,721 --> 02:55:26,180
Condensation in the air creates these 
fake clouds.

4429
02:55:26,330 --> 02:55:27,163
And yes,
these fake clouds can cool the earth 

4430
02:55:28,821 --> 02:55:29,654
down a little bit.
And in fact they've put them out on 

4431
02:55:31,401 --> 02:55:32,234
purpose,
but they're not putting them out on 

4432
02:55:32,871 --> 02:55:34,880
purpose.
It just a side effect of air travel.

4433
02:55:34,881 --> 02:55:35,714
Like they're,
they're making these assumptions based 

4434
02:55:37,881 --> 02:55:40,700
on seeing something that sky and 
thinking someone's spraying something.

4435
02:55:40,740 --> 02:55:41,573
I wasn't there actually like a Geo 
engineering thing that was actually 

4436
02:55:43,251 --> 02:55:44,750
something they're doing or planning to 
do.

4437
02:55:44,870 --> 02:55:45,703
There is definitely the possibility of 
one day us having no real protection 

4438
02:55:51,440 --> 02:55:53,930
what no ozone layer there is a 
possibility.

4439
02:55:53,931 --> 02:55:54,764
And one of the things that scientists 
have speculated is that suspending some 

4440
02:55:57,741 --> 02:56:01,280
sort of reflective particles in our 
atmosphere,

4441
02:56:01,281 --> 02:56:06,281
like satellites that would somehow or 
another protect us from solar radiation.

4442
02:56:06,820 --> 02:56:08,300
So there's something that people thought
of him,

4443
02:56:08,740 --> 02:56:11,810
but for the doing it well for sure 
someone has thought about doing it.

4444
02:56:11,811 --> 02:56:14,750
If that's the issue,
if we're missing some sort of atmosphere

4445
02:56:14,900 --> 02:56:15,230
and like,
oh,

4446
02:56:15,230 --> 02:56:17,210
can we create an atmosphere?
Yes we can.

4447
02:56:17,270 --> 02:56:19,190
How would we do it?
We'd spray chemicals in the sky.

4448
02:56:19,220 --> 02:56:20,053
Okay,
but that's not what you're seeing when 

4449
02:56:21,171 --> 02:56:24,080
you see those clouds behind jets.
It's really simple science.

4450
02:56:24,680 --> 02:56:26,120
The heat of the jet engine.
Yeah.

4451
02:56:26,240 --> 02:56:27,650
Craig on blocks with a constant.
Yeah.

4452
02:56:27,651 --> 02:56:30,000
The condensation in the atmosphere.
It creates a vape.

4453
02:56:30,060 --> 02:56:33,140
The these artificial clouds,
they look like clouds because they are a

4454
02:56:33,150 --> 02:56:33,983
cloud.

4455
02:56:34,710 --> 02:56:38,840
Makes perfect sense.
But to the armchair conspiracy theorist,

4456
02:56:38,841 --> 02:56:39,531
it looks up.
They like,

4457
02:56:39,531 --> 02:56:40,640
they're spraying us,
man.

4458
02:56:40,900 --> 02:56:41,540
Yes.
Spray.

4459
02:56:41,540 --> 02:56:42,810
Nice Guy,
man.

4460
02:56:42,830 --> 02:56:44,270
Come on and defend Alex turns for a 
minute.

4461
02:56:44,450 --> 02:56:45,490
I love Alex Jones.
Yeah,

4462
02:56:46,330 --> 02:56:48,170
I mean in a,
defend them about sandy hook.

4463
02:56:48,200 --> 02:56:48,740
No,
no.

4464
02:56:48,740 --> 02:56:51,390
I'm going to defend about the frogs.
What about the frogs?

4465
02:56:51,410 --> 02:56:52,830
It's true.
They telling me folks.

4466
02:56:52,831 --> 02:56:53,720
Okay.
Oh,

4467
02:56:53,721 --> 02:56:54,560
they turned frogs.
You know,

4468
02:56:54,561 --> 02:56:55,394
it was really ironic as well.
The globalists are telling the frogs 

4469
02:56:57,171 --> 02:56:57,951
gay.
Well,

4470
02:56:57,951 --> 02:56:58,970
there is a,
I mean,

4471
02:56:58,971 --> 02:56:59,804
I'm,
I'm actually being literally serious 

4472
02:57:00,521 --> 02:57:01,251
when I say,
well,

4473
02:57:01,251 --> 02:57:02,540
this pollution.
Yeah.

4474
02:57:02,600 --> 02:57:04,510
Yeah.
Pollution actually does make the fries.

4475
02:57:04,540 --> 02:57:05,373
It's corporate malfeasance and it's any,
a certain kind of frog and a certain 

4476
02:57:08,481 --> 02:57:09,314
kind of pesticide.
I actually read through the study and 

4477
02:57:10,690 --> 02:57:12,960
you played my video on his channel 
before I have,

4478
02:57:12,980 --> 02:57:16,270
my video was on my old trying to look 
and taken down by a metal channel.

4479
02:57:16,280 --> 02:57:17,113
Got taken down.
It was just a little ship hosty channel 

4480
02:57:18,790 --> 02:57:19,191
Dory.
But I,

4481
02:57:19,191 --> 02:57:22,730
but I'm the shit post each channel.
We mean just put bullshit on the,

4482
02:57:22,930 --> 02:57:23,763
Oh bullshit.
I found funny and one of the lovely 

4483
02:57:24,711 --> 02:57:26,580
thing was looking into this study,
Alex Jones's sighting.

4484
02:57:26,630 --> 02:57:28,910
So I thought I'd go and get the study 
actually read it.

4485
02:57:28,911 --> 02:57:32,090
And he's right kind of right here for 
example,

4486
02:57:32,330 --> 02:57:35,210
these people aren't actually globalist.
It's like a multinational corporation.

4487
02:57:35,450 --> 02:57:38,150
People who are actually open borders,
they are pro open borders.

4488
02:57:38,151 --> 02:57:39,170
They're pro pro,
you know,

4489
02:57:39,171 --> 02:57:42,440
corporate influence around the world 
because they run a giant corporation.

4490
02:57:42,950 --> 02:57:43,783
The chemicals they're putting in the 
water technically where actually he 

4491
02:57:45,861 --> 02:57:46,694
wasn't even going far enough.
These chemicals were making frogs trans 

4492
02:57:49,940 --> 02:57:53,720
like they would for 90% of the frogs.
And it was only a certain chemical,

4493
02:57:53,780 --> 02:57:56,810
a certain pesticide and it was affecting
a certain kind of frog.

4494
02:57:57,170 --> 02:57:57,950
So,
and it,

4495
02:57:57,950 --> 02:57:59,840
it doesn't,
it hasn't made them trans.

4496
02:57:59,960 --> 02:58:01,950
Well I identify the process.
Obviously,

4497
02:58:01,951 --> 02:58:02,070
I'm

4498
02:58:02,070 --> 02:58:03,120
not a scientist,
but like,

4499
02:58:03,480 --> 02:58:06,730
um,
but I mean if 90 days of finding one and

4500
02:58:06,790 --> 02:58:09,090
it literally for 90% of the frogs that 
were touched,

4501
02:58:09,120 --> 02:58:11,220
some of the,
I'll have to check the numbers,

4502
02:58:11,460 --> 02:58:12,293
but for a large,
from the majority of the folks touched 

4503
02:58:13,810 --> 02:58:14,643
it would make them behave in like the 
soft feminine wave male frogs and make 

4504
02:58:18,271 --> 02:58:21,690
them behave in a feminine way.
And for 10% of the frogs touched by this

4505
02:58:21,691 --> 02:58:24,060
chemical,
it would actually send through a process

4506
02:58:24,061 --> 02:58:28,320
to transform into a fertile female frog.
Holy Shit.

4507
02:58:28,350 --> 02:58:30,510
So it wouldn't be making gay,
it was lucy thinking trends.

4508
02:58:30,511 --> 02:58:32,370
Right.
That's not even trans.

4509
02:58:32,371 --> 02:58:33,204
Right.
But that's literally like changing your 

4510
02:58:34,501 --> 02:58:35,940
shoes,
your actual sex.

4511
02:58:35,970 --> 02:58:36,301
Yeah.
Yeah.

4512
02:58:36,301 --> 02:58:38,670
It's literally like transitioning into 
an actual female.

4513
02:58:38,671 --> 02:58:41,220
That's actually first I'll say it's 
better than we can do for human beings.

4514
02:58:41,510 --> 02:58:42,311
Um,
but this,

4515
02:58:42,311 --> 02:58:44,610
this,
this was actually a real thing.

4516
02:58:44,970 --> 02:58:45,803
It wasn't like an intentional plan to 
try and turn people into gays or trans 

4517
02:58:49,801 --> 02:58:51,120
or whatever though.
And it wasn't,

4518
02:58:51,121 --> 02:58:53,490
it was done by people who are globalists
probably,

4519
02:58:53,790 --> 02:58:55,920
but it wasn't done as part of a 
nefarious plot.

4520
02:58:56,040 --> 02:58:58,410
It was dumb because it was cheaper to 
just dump the chemicals,

4521
02:58:58,411 --> 02:58:59,070
you know,
office.

4522
02:58:59,070 --> 02:59:00,450
And it was just an unintended,
it's just,

4523
02:59:00,480 --> 02:59:02,370
it's just ironic going Alex.
Alex Jones says,

4524
02:59:02,371 --> 02:59:02,771
you know,
the,

4525
02:59:02,771 --> 02:59:03,604
the,
the globalist supporting chemicals into 

4526
02:59:04,801 --> 02:59:05,940
the water than make friends gay.
Well,

4527
02:59:05,941 --> 02:59:06,900
he ease,
right.

4528
02:59:07,170 --> 02:59:08,003
Well you know,
during Desert Storm there was a project 

4529
02:59:10,141 --> 02:59:13,710
that they put together where they were 
trying to figure out a gay bomb.

4530
02:59:14,060 --> 02:59:15,360
Yeah.
Do you know about that?

4531
02:59:15,460 --> 02:59:17,780
I had about like the soldiers were about
starting like you,

4532
02:59:17,781 --> 02:59:18,331
well,
okay,

4533
02:59:18,331 --> 02:59:20,400
I'm not feeling very horny.
But now I've decided,

4534
02:59:20,401 --> 02:59:21,530
I like men.
They would,

4535
02:59:21,570 --> 02:59:24,900
they would blow this stuff in the air,
blow it up,

4536
02:59:24,960 --> 02:59:25,793
and it would land down on them and it 
would transfer them into gay people and 

4537
02:59:28,351 --> 02:59:31,500
they'd be so ashamed that they would 
stop fighting and lose morale.

4538
02:59:31,650 --> 02:59:33,370
This was a real consideration they 
spent,

4539
02:59:34,040 --> 02:59:35,610
came about the Greeks,
didn't they?

4540
02:59:35,970 --> 02:59:36,930
Yeah,
exactly.

4541
02:59:36,960 --> 02:59:38,700
Cause these guys have fearsomely gay.
In fact,

4542
02:59:38,701 --> 02:59:39,534
with that was a super power to 
Thebesians scientists develop gay bomb 

4543
02:59:42,691 --> 02:59:45,390
to make enemy soldiers stop fighting.
Make love,

4544
02:59:45,480 --> 02:59:47,100
dude,
dude,

4545
02:59:47,250 --> 02:59:48,083
dude,
dude,

4546
02:59:48,270 --> 02:59:48,990
dude,
dude.

4547
02:59:48,990 --> 02:59:51,510
Two scientists at right laboratory in 
Dayton,

4548
02:59:51,511 --> 02:59:56,280
Ohio working to make America's military 
even mightier made the discovery in 1994

4549
02:59:56,281 --> 02:59:58,980
according to the detailed page papers on
our,

4550
02:59:58,981 --> 02:59:59,814
through a freedom of information request
and last night they were finally 

4551
03:00:04,111 --> 03:00:09,111
rewarded within what does that Igg,
iga or LG ignoble awards.

4552
03:00:09,630 --> 03:00:12,510
Nobel prize for peace.
A spoof of the Nobel prize.

4553
03:00:12,520 --> 03:00:14,910
Okay.
Due to be announced next week,

4554
03:00:14,911 --> 03:00:15,744
Marc Abrahams,
a editor of the animals of the 

4555
03:00:17,431 --> 03:00:21,210
improbable research and the man behind 
the ignoble awards explained,

4556
03:00:21,450 --> 03:00:25,890
we don't know if this document was the 
start and end of it or whatever.

4557
03:00:26,130 --> 03:00:26,963
In fact,
this project continued and perhaps 

4558
03:00:28,531 --> 03:00:30,600
continues to this day.

4559
03:00:30,900 --> 03:00:31,360
Dot.
Dot.

4560
03:00:31,360 --> 03:00:32,193
Duh.
So to this day they might be working on 

4561
03:00:33,331 --> 03:00:35,610
the gay bomb.
Do you think trump puts a stop to that?

4562
03:00:35,910 --> 03:00:37,530
He doesn't waste per necessarily 
spending.

4563
03:00:37,650 --> 03:00:38,640
He's pro gay then.
Yeah,

4564
03:00:38,641 --> 03:00:41,880
but he doesn't want to be too 
complicated change people.

4565
03:00:41,881 --> 03:00:42,714
What if a regular guy like him gets 
bitten by that spider I radioactive gay 

4566
03:00:45,541 --> 03:00:46,374
spider?
Do you know about how that tick that 

4567
03:00:47,521 --> 03:00:52,521
turns people into vegans?
Count down was a tick bite.

4568
03:00:53,040 --> 03:00:55,590
This tick bites you and you develop a 
meat allergy.

4569
03:00:55,860 --> 03:00:56,750
Oh really?
Yep.

4570
03:00:56,810 --> 03:00:58,920
Well it's called the lone star tick.
Whether they,

4571
03:00:59,590 --> 03:01:00,423
where they live,
probably taxes cause it's called the 

4572
03:01:01,691 --> 03:01:04,300
lone star tick actually guesser but I 
think they're spreading.

4573
03:01:05,020 --> 03:01:08,840
But it would be ironic if it was in like
the meat eating capital of the world and

4574
03:01:08,870 --> 03:01:09,703
lone star tick making people allergic to
red meat that eat the fuck out of some 

4575
03:01:13,001 --> 03:01:13,410
chicken.

4576
03:01:13,410 --> 03:01:17,200
Now I'll tell you that Jack.
And it was engineered by the government.

4577
03:01:17,470 --> 03:01:18,303
Uh,
I just think it's just nature deciding 

4578
03:01:20,651 --> 03:01:22,480
we're tired of their bullshit.
Look,

4579
03:01:22,510 --> 03:01:23,343
it's been recorded as far north as Maine
and all the way to central Texas and 

4580
03:01:26,141 --> 03:01:27,550
Oklahoma.
Wow.

4581
03:01:27,820 --> 03:01:28,653
The ticks are found in the dense 
undergrowth and wooded areas as well as 

4582
03:01:31,571 --> 03:01:33,700
around animal resting areas.
You know,

4583
03:01:33,701 --> 03:01:34,534
I've been thinking about this man 
because I run in the hills where this 

4584
03:01:36,491 --> 03:01:37,324
ticks.
I saw tick like Ari and I did a podcast 

4585
03:01:39,611 --> 03:01:42,040
the other day that we will release on 
July 18th,

4586
03:01:42,041 --> 03:01:44,470
which is the day that Ariz Netflix 
special comes out.

4587
03:01:44,770 --> 03:01:48,160
But we did a podcast where we went on a 
hike and I put on a weighted vest and we

4588
03:01:48,161 --> 03:01:48,994
went through the woods and did the whole
thing that I do when I run and I'm a 

4589
03:01:51,821 --> 03:01:56,260
tick landed on Ari and we knocked it off
and then we started talking about it and

4590
03:01:56,261 --> 03:01:56,710
like go on.

4591
03:01:56,710 --> 03:01:59,890
Like is there a way to stop ticks from 
coming on you?

4592
03:01:59,920 --> 03:02:02,740
Is there like an effective,
did they have a spray?

4593
03:02:03,070 --> 03:02:05,020
Like ticks are not like mosquitoes,
right?

4594
03:02:05,130 --> 03:02:07,660
No.
Is there an effective tick spray?

4595
03:02:07,830 --> 03:02:09,520
No.
Do you should know?

4596
03:02:09,521 --> 03:02:10,354
Do you're so smart,
but I don't know that ticks and I'm the 

4597
03:02:13,090 --> 03:02:16,420
last month there's Tikrit Pelham.
Other is how effective it is though.

4598
03:02:16,560 --> 03:02:18,310
Hmm.
Yeah.

4599
03:02:18,311 --> 03:02:21,840
Mosquito repellent doesn't always work.
I get bit of a fucking works.

4600
03:02:21,850 --> 03:02:23,350
I can't bullshit.
You know what works?

4601
03:02:23,830 --> 03:02:26,450
Thermacell you're used the thermacell.
Oh Man.

4602
03:02:26,451 --> 03:02:28,570
I don't know if it's bad for you,
but it's amazing.

4603
03:02:28,571 --> 03:02:30,580
I didn't even know that his thermos 
cells in a,

4604
03:02:30,581 --> 03:02:35,581
a piece of equipment that people take on
hikes and camping and hunting it.

4605
03:02:37,021 --> 03:02:38,090
Um,
it's,

4606
03:02:38,240 --> 03:02:42,130
there's this chemical that screws into 
the bottom and then it has an element.

4607
03:02:42,190 --> 03:02:44,740
You Click it and heats on and it makes 
it's fine.

4608
03:02:44,740 --> 03:02:48,730
Mist through this element and this fine 
mist.

4609
03:02:49,930 --> 03:02:54,490
It doesn't smell bad to people,
but mosquitoes cannot fuck with it.

4610
03:02:54,760 --> 03:02:56,830
They just,
they just vanish like,

4611
03:02:56,831 --> 03:02:57,430
well,
is it,

4612
03:02:57,430 --> 03:02:59,950
it's not poisonous to let alone the time
or I don't know,

4613
03:02:59,951 --> 03:03:01,030
man.
That's a problem.

4614
03:03:01,060 --> 03:03:03,340
Yeah.
I don't want to be saying doing this.

4615
03:03:03,341 --> 03:03:05,810
And then five years later you got 
dementia and I heard you.

4616
03:03:06,080 --> 03:03:07,450
I'm thinking,
yeah,

4617
03:03:07,451 --> 03:03:08,500
I'm panicking now.
Shit.

4618
03:03:09,010 --> 03:03:11,080
Some things I can't remember.
So it'd be good for them.

4619
03:03:11,500 --> 03:03:12,333
Yeah.
What about him?

4620
03:03:12,760 --> 03:03:14,140
I've seen him.
Oh No,

4621
03:03:14,141 --> 03:03:15,670
I definitely have it.
But I went looking.

4622
03:03:15,760 --> 03:03:16,690
Did Ya?
Yeah,

4623
03:03:16,720 --> 03:03:18,310
I did a whole TV show about it.
Yeah.

4624
03:03:18,311 --> 03:03:19,870
Did you?
Yeah.

4625
03:03:19,960 --> 03:03:20,890
Well,
I did this,

4626
03:03:20,891 --> 03:03:24,520
a show that I used to do on the Scifi 
channel that made me,

4627
03:03:24,550 --> 03:03:25,383
this is get made a lot of people mad at 
me and it also made me realize what 

4628
03:03:29,111 --> 03:03:30,850
conspiracy theories really we're all 
about.

4629
03:03:30,880 --> 03:03:32,890
And the show's called Joe Rogan 
questions,

4630
03:03:32,891 --> 03:03:33,724
everything.
So it would go and I would embed myself 

4631
03:03:35,201 --> 03:03:36,034
with these people and hang out with them
and I embedded myself with these big 

4632
03:03:37,991 --> 03:03:40,810
foot people.
And what I said at the end of it was,

4633
03:03:41,080 --> 03:03:41,913
here's one thing that you don't find 
when you go looking for bigfoot black 

4634
03:03:44,741 --> 03:03:47,440
people,
you're more likely to find big foot than

4635
03:03:47,441 --> 03:03:49,100
you are black people looking for 
bigfoot.

4636
03:03:49,570 --> 03:03:52,810
It's a bunch of unfuckable white guys 
out camping.

4637
03:03:56,000 --> 03:03:58,760
It's true black people to want to have 
nothing to do with it.

4638
03:03:58,761 --> 03:04:02,840
It's a goofy white obsession and it's 
also,

4639
03:04:02,841 --> 03:04:05,870
um,
there's no one that I talked to her.

4640
03:04:05,871 --> 03:04:07,970
This is like one lady that had a pretty 
good story.

4641
03:04:09,110 --> 03:04:11,060
She believed that she was saying,
but here's the thing,

4642
03:04:11,061 --> 03:04:13,850
black bears are huge and they,
the,

4643
03:04:13,860 --> 03:04:14,693
you know,
you can get a black beard seven feet 

4644
03:04:15,411 --> 03:04:17,690
tall easily and they walk on their hind 
legs.

4645
03:04:17,691 --> 03:04:19,640
Sometimes they just do,
everybody knows they do.

4646
03:04:19,670 --> 03:04:21,440
There's video of them.
It's not a mystery.

4647
03:04:22,010 --> 03:04:24,920
Black bears walking through the woods on
hind legs are seven feet tall.

4648
03:04:24,921 --> 03:04:25,754
You would think that's big for us.
It's really just telling him our shops 

4649
03:04:27,440 --> 03:04:28,091
like that.
I mean there's,

4650
03:04:28,091 --> 03:04:29,570
if there's no big foot,
but the earth is flat,

4651
03:04:29,571 --> 03:04:30,410
we'll do,
I believe,

4652
03:04:31,010 --> 03:04:32,750
well,
I don't think the earth is flat either.

4653
03:04:32,751 --> 03:04:35,420
I think it's just everything's aligned,
man.

4654
03:04:35,660 --> 03:04:37,870
This is all psy ops thing.
It's,

4655
03:04:37,910 --> 03:04:39,890
there are so many,
like really convincing stories.

4656
03:04:39,950 --> 03:04:41,960
That's the thing.
The third one,

4657
03:04:42,350 --> 03:04:43,790
sorry,
I haven't heard one of them.

4658
03:04:43,820 --> 03:04:45,540
Well,
convincing stories of big foot.

4659
03:04:45,620 --> 03:04:46,191
No.
Oh,

4660
03:04:46,191 --> 03:04:47,030
I've had loads.
Whether like,

4661
03:04:47,031 --> 03:04:47,631
you know,
I was,

4662
03:04:47,631 --> 03:04:48,261
I was like,
you know,

4663
03:04:48,261 --> 03:04:50,090
five feet away from this.
Like,

4664
03:04:50,091 --> 03:04:51,500
you know,
he's saying and it didn't have like,

4665
03:04:51,501 --> 03:04:52,334
you know,
he didn't have the best price and a 

4666
03:04:52,761 --> 03:04:54,590
man's face and they'll,
they'll be like,

4667
03:04:54,591 --> 03:04:55,190
you know,
and it was,

4668
03:04:55,190 --> 03:04:56,690
it was looking at me and stuff with 
this.

4669
03:04:56,930 --> 03:04:58,460
Is that okay?
But nobody's ever gold.

4670
03:04:58,461 --> 03:04:59,780
Good picture of any of these things,
you know?

4671
03:04:59,960 --> 03:05:00,793
Yeah.
Nobody really goes to the woods on a 

4672
03:05:02,931 --> 03:05:05,420
regular other than Les Stroud Survivor.
Man.

4673
03:05:05,421 --> 03:05:07,240
He believes that you thinks one,
but there,

4674
03:05:07,241 --> 03:05:09,470
there are never any bodies.
There's never any feces.

4675
03:05:09,620 --> 03:05:12,350
I've heard bears makeup fucking monkey 
noise too.

4676
03:05:12,350 --> 03:05:14,120
I heard him say that.
He's like,

4677
03:05:14,121 --> 03:05:16,220
it made it sound.
He's like,

4678
03:05:16,960 --> 03:05:19,520
there's clearly a primate sound,
but I've heard,

4679
03:05:19,521 --> 03:05:23,750
I've seen in my own eyes in the woods a 
bear do that with another bear.

4680
03:05:23,760 --> 03:05:25,460
Yeah.
They make that when they fight with each

4681
03:05:25,461 --> 03:05:25,820
other.
Yeah.

4682
03:05:25,820 --> 03:05:28,590
It must be bad as it must be like 
hopping percents.

4683
03:05:28,870 --> 03:05:29,703
Cause I mean you can't have like,
you can't have like a species of 

4684
03:05:32,061 --> 03:05:34,490
Australia pithy kiss or whatever it,
it's supposed to be gigantic.

4685
03:05:34,980 --> 03:05:35,380
Sorry.
Yeah.

4686
03:05:35,380 --> 03:05:37,490
Drag it into piff kiss whatever is 
supposed to be.

4687
03:05:37,491 --> 03:05:40,410
And just like [inaudible] is America's a
huge place.

4688
03:05:41,300 --> 03:05:43,640
You would find,
you would find something,

4689
03:05:43,930 --> 03:05:46,670
you find a dead one or something after a
while.

4690
03:05:46,700 --> 03:05:47,533
There's enough people looking.
But the thing is when they found out 

4691
03:05:50,121 --> 03:05:55,121
that like that about that Hobbit Guy,
do you know the hollow Homo Floresiensis

4692
03:05:57,110 --> 03:05:58,600
for instances?
For instance,

4693
03:05:58,700 --> 03:06:01,220
I know the thing you talking about,
it was in the island of Flores.

4694
03:06:01,220 --> 03:06:03,950
Yeah.
And Indonesia they found within the last

4695
03:06:03,951 --> 03:06:04,784
14,000
years there was absolutely a little 

4696
03:06:07,281 --> 03:06:11,540
person that was like two and a half,
three feet tall look like,

4697
03:06:11,541 --> 03:06:12,200
uh,
yeah.

4698
03:06:12,200 --> 03:06:14,570
But they look 100% human.
Oh,

4699
03:06:14,571 --> 03:06:17,720
this thing is did not look 100% human.
It was a new car.

4700
03:06:17,750 --> 03:06:21,570
It was another type or an offshoot of 
Homo sapiens.

4701
03:06:22,310 --> 03:06:23,001
Yeah,
I mean,

4702
03:06:23,001 --> 03:06:26,790
I don't know if they classified it.
I don't know if they have DNA on it.

4703
03:06:26,791 --> 03:06:27,090
It's,
it's,

4704
03:06:27,090 --> 03:06:30,350
it's a relation of hume that yes,
it's a type of human,

4705
03:06:30,590 --> 03:06:33,410
but it's not neanderthal tall and it's 
not homosapien.

4706
03:06:33,740 --> 03:06:36,140
And this thing was 14,000
years ago.

4707
03:06:36,560 --> 03:06:39,920
So they know that gigantic [inaudible] 
was a real animal in the net.

4708
03:06:39,950 --> 03:06:44,950
It lived on hundred per 100% alongside 
human beings as recently as 100,000

4709
03:06:45,711 --> 03:06:47,810
years ago.
But this,

4710
03:06:47,811 --> 03:06:49,090
uh,
this is just nonsense.

4711
03:06:49,100 --> 03:06:50,180
I was big for thing.
Well,

4712
03:06:50,181 --> 03:06:52,670
that Orang pen deck is much more 
interesting.

4713
03:06:52,730 --> 03:06:57,630
The orange pen deck is a small Hobbit,
like man that lived,

4714
03:06:57,660 --> 03:06:58,493
uh,
I think that might've been Indonesia as 

4715
03:06:59,461 --> 03:07:00,360
well.
Right.

4716
03:07:00,390 --> 03:07:03,120
But what is the Vietnam?
Vietnam,

4717
03:07:03,450 --> 03:07:04,410
well,
I think it's these,

4718
03:07:04,500 --> 03:07:05,333
some of these tropical jungle climates 
where there might have been as recently 

4719
03:07:08,761 --> 03:07:09,121
as,
you know,

4720
03:07:09,121 --> 03:07:09,954
a hundred years ago or whatever,
that might have been a few of those 

4721
03:07:12,121 --> 03:07:14,250
fuckers remaining.
They don't know.

4722
03:07:14,640 --> 03:07:16,380
I mean when someone dies in the woods,
man,

4723
03:07:16,381 --> 03:07:18,300
do you know how many people we lose in 
the United States?

4724
03:07:18,301 --> 03:07:20,070
Loads thousands.
Every year.

4725
03:07:20,100 --> 03:07:20,933
Thousands.
I watched David polite all the time on 

4726
03:07:23,191 --> 03:07:25,940
like art bell and stuff.
I think he's great and he's,

4727
03:07:26,090 --> 03:07:26,821
I,
I love that.

4728
03:07:26,821 --> 03:07:27,654
He's like such clean coal American guy 
and he never goes into like the wild 

4729
03:07:30,181 --> 03:07:32,070
conspiracy theory angle to it.
But it's,

4730
03:07:32,071 --> 03:07:33,570
it's,
it's always hinting that,

4731
03:07:33,571 --> 03:07:35,210
uh,
it's probably painful.

4732
03:07:35,750 --> 03:07:37,490
So Santiago,
well that was a book,

4733
03:07:37,530 --> 03:07:38,250
a movie wrapped.

4734
03:07:38,250 --> 03:07:40,860
Never is.
It's like Bobcat Goldthwait made a movie

4735
03:07:40,861 --> 03:07:42,960
about big foot eating people.
Oh Wow.

4736
03:07:42,990 --> 03:07:44,250
It's a great move.
They're fine.

4737
03:07:44,310 --> 03:07:46,740
It's called Willow Creek.
It's a horror movie.

4738
03:07:46,810 --> 03:07:49,800
And you liked bobcat bolt golf.
Wade made a horror movie dude.

4739
03:07:49,801 --> 03:07:50,634
He made a great horror movie.
It's like a sort of like one of those 

4740
03:07:53,461 --> 03:07:58,080
Blair witch project type movies about a 
couple that go up looking for bigfoot,

4741
03:07:58,110 --> 03:07:59,790
you know,
and just a film like where are they?

4742
03:07:59,791 --> 03:08:02,820
Original Patterson footage was taken 
place.

4743
03:08:03,690 --> 03:08:05,220
It's a person in a suit.
People love,

4744
03:08:05,250 --> 03:08:08,070
they want to believe that person that 
fucking say bobcat ones bleed.

4745
03:08:08,100 --> 03:08:10,170
But why?
But why did they put tits on the seat?

4746
03:08:10,680 --> 03:08:15,680
Because it's a girl get up.
Why would they make terrible anybody who

4747
03:08:17,521 --> 03:08:18,740
looks at it,
it looks like a person.

4748
03:08:18,760 --> 03:08:20,790
A suit as well.
Another part of my bit,

4749
03:08:20,791 --> 03:08:21,624
I said,
whenever you see something that looks 

4750
03:08:22,351 --> 03:08:24,430
like a person in a suit,
it's a person in a suit.

4751
03:08:24,640 --> 03:08:27,570
There's not a fucking animal.
A lot lose a person in a suit.

4752
03:08:27,571 --> 03:08:28,480
Yeah.
I just,

4753
03:08:29,130 --> 03:08:30,990
I just wanna know the conversation was,
I look if we,

4754
03:08:31,440 --> 03:08:32,273
if we get mail,
so it means he's going to look like 

4755
03:08:33,900 --> 03:08:34,733
person to suit,
but if we get a female so they can be 

4756
03:08:36,031 --> 03:08:37,050
like,
why would they,

4757
03:08:37,200 --> 03:08:38,470
why would they put tits on it?
Well,

4758
03:08:38,480 --> 03:08:39,313
he was can a real big,
they did a female because the female 

4759
03:08:41,041 --> 03:08:41,874
would be smaller than male.
So instead of it being an eight foot 

4760
03:08:45,151 --> 03:08:45,984
tall thing,
you get a six foot tall thing and it's 

4761
03:08:47,970 --> 03:08:51,110
like a regular size dude with some nice 
tits and you're like,

4762
03:08:51,120 --> 03:08:52,200
it's chick bro.
Meanwhile,

4763
03:08:52,201 --> 03:08:54,120
it's a big guy,
like a big seven foot.

4764
03:08:54,140 --> 03:08:55,860
I mean,
I love the big food.

4765
03:08:55,920 --> 03:08:56,753
Like I live the breakdown videos will 
live youtube the grade and it's always 

4766
03:08:59,791 --> 03:09:00,720
like done.
Let's do it in a suit.

4767
03:09:01,170 --> 03:09:02,003
It was a Wiki leaks that was just 
released today about NASA knowing about 

4768
03:09:05,490 --> 03:09:08,870
aliens.
Railey yes.

4769
03:09:10,620 --> 03:09:11,820
Pull it up.
Jamie.

4770
03:09:12,990 --> 03:09:16,470
NASA knows about aliens.
They have information on Wiki leaks,

4771
03:09:16,471 --> 03:09:19,350
knows if they're going to spill the 
beans.

4772
03:09:19,470 --> 03:09:22,140
I tell you when it comes out somewhere 
so that it really is true.

4773
03:09:22,141 --> 03:09:22,974
And then there's like an alien 
ambassador on the White House lawn or 

4774
03:09:24,601 --> 03:09:25,434
something.
You gotta be like,

4775
03:09:25,560 --> 03:09:26,161
Oh,
okay.

4776
03:09:26,161 --> 03:09:27,840
I was in a unit like a prowling.
Oh,

4777
03:09:27,841 --> 03:09:28,674
it's anonymous.
I thought it was much more likely to be 

4778
03:09:32,371 --> 03:09:33,320
pranksters.
Yeah,

4779
03:09:33,890 --> 03:09:35,150
yeah,
yeah.

4780
03:09:35,580 --> 03:09:38,640
Much more likely.
That's anonymous.

4781
03:09:38,641 --> 03:09:42,420
A global hacking collected the leads 
that alien life exists and thanks.

4782
03:09:42,421 --> 03:09:45,480
NASA is about to confirm it.
The shadowy group.

4783
03:09:45,510 --> 03:09:46,650
Oh yeah.
I love that.

4784
03:09:46,720 --> 03:09:49,530
It's a shadowy group of artists and you 
can be in,

4785
03:09:49,680 --> 03:09:50,513
you could join.
Oh,

4786
03:09:50,640 --> 03:09:51,221
I have,
you know,

4787
03:09:51,221 --> 03:09:52,850
I'm not,
I mean I'm in to exactly.

4788
03:09:52,910 --> 03:09:53,743
Uh,
in a 12 and a half minute video 

4789
03:09:55,361 --> 03:09:58,330
publishing an unofficial youtube channel
on Tuesday,

4790
03:09:58,331 --> 03:10:02,680
the video centers around recent findings
by the American space organization,

4791
03:10:02,681 --> 03:10:07,330
including the discovery of 219 new 
planet candidates,

4792
03:10:07,331 --> 03:10:08,164
10 of which present similar conditions 
to Earth by NASA's Kepler space 

4793
03:10:12,011 --> 03:10:12,844
telescope team in June,
as well as comments made by a senior 

4794
03:10:16,211 --> 03:10:18,280
NASA official.
But here's the real thing,

4795
03:10:18,430 --> 03:10:19,390
right?
You believe in,

4796
03:10:19,391 --> 03:10:22,810
I believe as well that it's entirely 
possible that some life exists somewhere

4797
03:10:22,811 --> 03:10:25,330
in the infinite universe.
Can't believe it doesn't.

4798
03:10:25,450 --> 03:10:27,040
Of course.
I mean we're on the same page.

4799
03:10:27,310 --> 03:10:30,130
Why are we so skeptical about skeptical 
about it visiting us?

4800
03:10:30,160 --> 03:10:31,900
Because it's very difficult to visit us,
right?

4801
03:10:31,930 --> 03:10:33,760
But if it's like way more advanced than 
us,

4802
03:10:33,940 --> 03:10:36,130
shouldn't it be able to figure it out?
Just like we could figure out how to get

4803
03:10:36,131 --> 03:10:36,964
a probe to Jupiter,
but why can't it figure out how to 

4804
03:10:38,291 --> 03:10:39,100
visit?

4805
03:10:39,100 --> 03:10:42,300
But then we've got a government 
conspiracy and cover.

4806
03:10:42,750 --> 03:10:46,270
Do we or are they just people and they 
don't know any more than you are?

4807
03:10:46,271 --> 03:10:47,650
I like,
we don't know shit.

4808
03:10:47,651 --> 03:10:49,300
Why would the,
what if aliens came here?

4809
03:10:49,301 --> 03:10:51,700
Do you think they would like go,
oh that's an elected official.

4810
03:10:51,820 --> 03:10:54,490
Clearly that guy's the mayor.
Let me talk to him.

4811
03:10:54,640 --> 03:10:56,740
No,
they'd look at this fucking ant hill and

4812
03:10:56,741 --> 03:10:58,810
they'd be like,
which one of these dip should we tell?

4813
03:10:58,960 --> 03:10:59,793
I Dunno it just pick that guy up.
Just stick some stuff up his ass and do 

4814
03:11:02,621 --> 03:11:05,870
some run some tests on him.
That's bullocks though cause we,

4815
03:11:05,980 --> 03:11:06,813
and listen to it.
I've gotten really offended and we've 

4816
03:11:08,711 --> 03:11:10,850
got a friends online forever and this is
just a call the counselor.

4817
03:11:10,960 --> 03:11:11,890
I'll give it to this.
We can,

4818
03:11:11,891 --> 03:11:14,020
we can distinguish between from one end 
to another.

4819
03:11:14,150 --> 03:11:15,050
Yeah,
we can see the workers,

4820
03:11:15,070 --> 03:11:16,570
we can see the soldiers,
we can see the queen.

4821
03:11:16,900 --> 03:11:17,800
They can,
they can tell.

4822
03:11:17,830 --> 03:11:18,663
They would surely be smart.
But does the queen or physically shaped 

4823
03:11:22,391 --> 03:11:23,224
different?

4824
03:11:24,120 --> 03:11:24,953
Hmm.

4825
03:11:25,130 --> 03:11:29,060
They're different things.
Like this big one makes all the babies.

4826
03:11:29,330 --> 03:11:32,080
It's pretty obvious that a queen bee,
she's,

4827
03:11:32,150 --> 03:11:32,983
she has a giant Stinger that doesn't 
detach and she goes and kills all the 

4828
03:11:36,201 --> 03:11:38,810
baby bees,
which is trying to kill the women.

4829
03:11:39,350 --> 03:11:41,210
They speak English.
They probably can,

4830
03:11:41,640 --> 03:11:42,473
but if they say Mr President,
we have to think that if something is 

4831
03:11:46,041 --> 03:11:46,874
alien that it could be so alien that all
of our concepts of culture are so 

4832
03:11:51,411 --> 03:11:55,520
bizarre that there's no context for it 
to relate to send a language.

4833
03:11:55,550 --> 03:11:59,480
They've just know what we're saying.
They know what we're saying based on the

4834
03:11:59,481 --> 03:12:03,080
fact that it's fairly simple.
If they can understand the language then

4835
03:12:03,081 --> 03:12:06,610
they must have real relatable or similar
concepts in their own board.

4836
03:12:06,830 --> 03:12:08,780
Not necessarily.
It'd be able to translate,

4837
03:12:08,781 --> 03:12:10,910
not necessarily then the continents 
language.

4838
03:12:10,940 --> 03:12:11,773
That's not necessarily true.
That's putting them into a limitation 

4839
03:12:14,001 --> 03:12:14,834
that we currently have.
Like we don't understand dolphin 

4840
03:12:16,371 --> 03:12:18,720
language,
but we know they have a language we can,

4841
03:12:18,890 --> 03:12:22,130
we can appreciate the dolphins probably 
have a concept for eating.

4842
03:12:23,520 --> 03:12:23,910
Right?
Right.

4843
03:12:23,910 --> 03:12:25,690
So like if,
if the dolphins,

4844
03:12:25,691 --> 03:12:26,524
I didn't,
I didn't know what dolphin temperature 

4845
03:12:28,460 --> 03:12:31,790
in terms of like who's the queen,
who's the mayor hierarchical,

4846
03:12:31,800 --> 03:12:32,633
you know,
they don't have like an Alpha Dolphin 

4847
03:12:34,180 --> 03:12:35,013
and people,
the dolphins will have some like clicks 

4848
03:12:38,020 --> 03:12:38,853
that mean the person in charge.
I mean they must have some concept of 

4849
03:12:41,861 --> 03:12:44,740
hierarchy because they have a concept 
for see them operate under.

4850
03:12:44,741 --> 03:12:46,200
Right.
But you know,

4851
03:12:46,220 --> 03:12:49,300
if we could don't really understand 
dolphin language will know.

4852
03:12:49,301 --> 03:12:52,130
But I mean we can surely pick out like 
the

4853
03:12:52,160 --> 03:12:52,993
concepts themselves.
I mean they must be the concept of the 

4854
03:12:55,691 --> 03:12:56,524
Leda.
I though they just count on send the 

4855
03:12:57,831 --> 03:12:58,664
concept of labor.
I don't think it is widely understood 

4856
03:13:02,871 --> 03:13:04,700
what dolphins are saying.
I think it's,

4857
03:13:04,710 --> 03:13:08,600
when I translate dolphin to humans,
we can't even recreate it.

4858
03:13:08,730 --> 03:13:09,270
No,
no,

4859
03:13:09,270 --> 03:13:11,240
I'm sure what I mean,
we can't recreate their,

4860
03:13:11,241 --> 03:13:13,700
sounds like we don't know what their 
sounds mean.

4861
03:13:13,820 --> 03:13:15,710
Like if we set a bunch of shit to a 
dolphin,

4862
03:13:18,010 --> 03:13:19,670
I'm not saying we can talk to dolphins 
or anything,

4863
03:13:19,671 --> 03:13:21,230
but like,
like with a,

4864
03:13:21,231 --> 03:13:21,951
with a dog,
you know,

4865
03:13:21,951 --> 03:13:22,350
you can,
they,

4866
03:13:22,350 --> 03:13:26,170
the dogs would go sit in kinds of very,
very primitive methods of communication.

4867
03:13:26,171 --> 03:13:27,860
But like a dog whimpers you know,
it's in pain,

4868
03:13:27,880 --> 03:13:29,620
right?
You know it.

4869
03:13:29,900 --> 03:13:32,690
And so I have to have a concept of 
being,

4870
03:13:32,691 --> 03:13:33,524
uh,
being in pain to understand the dog's 

4871
03:13:34,671 --> 03:13:36,980
going.
I know that that means the dog hurt.

4872
03:13:37,040 --> 03:13:38,820
I must understand that the concept of 
hurts.

4873
03:13:38,920 --> 03:13:40,970
Right.
And so if the aliens,

4874
03:13:41,030 --> 03:13:41,863
if they can end standing diced and they 
must understand the concept of what 

4875
03:13:43,791 --> 03:13:46,760
president is or they must have,
they must have some sort of,

4876
03:13:46,940 --> 03:13:49,520
they must have a clean way of analyzing 
it.

4877
03:13:49,550 --> 03:13:50,383
Surely they for sure,
if they can take taking all [inaudible] 

4878
03:13:52,800 --> 03:13:53,930
superior to us.
I'll be saying,

4879
03:13:54,350 --> 03:13:55,183
well if not superior technologically far
more advanced in in that there've been 

4880
03:13:59,151 --> 03:14:02,270
alive longer.
But when you consider the possibility of

4881
03:14:02,271 --> 03:14:04,790
all sorts of different weather 
conditions,

4882
03:14:04,791 --> 03:14:08,180
different life conditions,
maybe different solar systems where they

4883
03:14:08,181 --> 03:14:12,110
have zero concern about being hit by an 
asteroid is bipedal.

4884
03:14:12,140 --> 03:14:13,200
Yeah.
And it's like,

4885
03:14:13,210 --> 03:14:14,043
fine.
Well that's because they're supposed to 

4886
03:14:15,651 --> 03:14:19,610
represent us in the future cause easier.
Is that what it is?

4887
03:14:19,760 --> 03:14:21,940
Surely.
Because we were called the funny too.

4888
03:14:22,010 --> 03:14:23,300
I think it's a relatable thing.

4889
03:14:23,300 --> 03:14:24,133
It'd be that too,
but that was my point is that I think 

4890
03:14:25,221 --> 03:14:30,221
that aliens could potentially be so 
alien that they can't even relate to the

4891
03:14:30,831 --> 03:14:33,920
concept of our ability to communicate 
with noises.

4892
03:14:34,280 --> 03:14:35,220
Like they might be.
Emily,

4893
03:14:35,221 --> 03:14:36,680
Katie Fair with smells.
Yeah,

4894
03:14:36,681 --> 03:14:37,514
exactly.
Yeah.

4895
03:14:37,610 --> 03:14:40,910
They might be using some telekinesis or 
some shit.

4896
03:14:42,350 --> 03:14:43,460
Psychics,
man.

4897
03:14:43,490 --> 03:14:44,490
Yeah,
maybe.

4898
03:14:45,100 --> 03:14:46,090
I mean,
so he's,

4899
03:14:46,140 --> 03:14:50,990
do you think if you had a bet all of 
your youtube money very much.

4900
03:14:50,991 --> 03:14:55,100
I have aliens.
Have aliens been here or no?

4901
03:14:56,090 --> 03:14:59,450
I probably been no,
no.

4902
03:14:59,490 --> 03:15:00,510
Yeah,
but skeptic,

4903
03:15:01,860 --> 03:15:05,540
I mean all of the ancient alien stuff.
It's total horse shit.

4904
03:15:05,750 --> 03:15:07,910
Yes.
Total Horse Shit.

4905
03:15:07,940 --> 03:15:12,080
That stuff is really fits more time.
Graham Hancock,

4906
03:15:12,081 --> 03:15:15,050
Randall Carlson mode of there being an 
ancient,

4907
03:15:15,051 --> 03:15:18,110
very advanced civilization that probably
was wiped out.

4908
03:15:18,290 --> 03:15:21,350
Just like we know there have been 
civilizations that were wiped out.

4909
03:15:21,590 --> 03:15:25,310
It's much more likely that someone like 
say in Machu Picchu,

4910
03:15:25,400 --> 03:15:28,910
someone was able to construct things,
you know,

4911
03:15:28,911 --> 03:15:32,150
that were like really confusing cause 
today,

4912
03:15:32,310 --> 03:15:33,790
yeah,
it wouldn't come from the new world.

4913
03:15:33,860 --> 03:15:34,693
Um,
it's really interesting because as soon 

4914
03:15:36,711 --> 03:15:38,090
as you start going down this line you 
think,

4915
03:15:38,091 --> 03:15:38,924
okay,
well do you need to have high 

4916
03:15:39,501 --> 03:15:40,334
civilization?
You need sudden series of things and 

4917
03:15:42,171 --> 03:15:43,310
there are a bunch of books you can it 
to.

4918
03:15:44,180 --> 03:15:46,250
Abundance of food,
agriculture.

4919
03:15:46,670 --> 03:15:48,350
It's like you need a little more than 
that as well.

4920
03:15:48,351 --> 03:15:49,710
But like he's,
you can,

4921
03:15:49,711 --> 03:15:49,980
you can

4922
03:15:49,980 --> 03:15:51,330
read a ton of solar things,
wealth,

4923
03:15:51,331 --> 03:15:53,760
power or poverty in politics,
come up with the title is,

4924
03:15:54,020 --> 03:15:55,110
um,
and uh,

4925
03:15:55,111 --> 03:15:57,810
why nations fail and,
uh,

4926
03:15:57,840 --> 03:16:02,290
what's the guns,
germs and steel red and we these books.

4927
03:16:02,291 --> 03:16:03,124
And then suddenly you understand what,
what populations need three quarters of 

4928
03:16:05,821 --> 03:16:06,451
it.
I should be honest,

4929
03:16:06,451 --> 03:16:07,830
it's really good.
I bailed on it,

4930
03:16:08,700 --> 03:16:09,780
but it,
you know,

4931
03:16:09,820 --> 03:16:10,653
there's a whole slew of things you need 
as a civilization for humans to develop 

4932
03:16:14,341 --> 03:16:15,174
to high sort of standards,
population density and all this sort of 

4933
03:16:18,691 --> 03:16:19,770
thing.
And so,

4934
03:16:19,900 --> 03:16:21,600
um,
but it's not just population densities,

4935
03:16:21,630 --> 03:16:24,900
lots of other places that have high 
population densities.

4936
03:16:25,140 --> 03:16:28,920
So in Africa for example,
you've got very few areas that have high

4937
03:16:28,921 --> 03:16:29,754
population density.
And so you don't have great 

4938
03:16:32,311 --> 03:16:35,820
civilizations like in sort of sub 
Saharan Africa because there just aren't

4939
03:16:36,150 --> 03:16:38,370
great cities,
dense cities to trade with.

4940
03:16:38,610 --> 03:16:39,480
And then,
and then you go,

4941
03:16:39,481 --> 03:16:40,410
okay,
well what they had,

4942
03:16:40,411 --> 03:16:41,244
it's difficult tree cause in Africa and 
this is something that Thomas soul goes 

4943
03:16:42,961 --> 03:16:46,500
into is a look the rivers a Humphrey 
navigable,

4944
03:16:47,010 --> 03:16:47,843
you know,
they've got lots of rapids and some 

4945
03:16:48,471 --> 03:16:49,380
rocks and not very deep.

4946
03:16:49,620 --> 03:16:52,000
You can't carry huge barges done.
They're not like,

4947
03:16:52,170 --> 03:16:55,230
they're not like the Danube.
You know this thing goes for,

4948
03:16:55,231 --> 03:16:56,064
you know,
hundreds of miles and his deep and you 

4949
03:16:57,481 --> 03:16:59,730
can get barges all up and down it and 
stuff like this.

4950
03:17:00,150 --> 03:17:01,590
I mean,
and traveling,

4951
03:17:01,830 --> 03:17:04,650
traveling goods by water is so much more
fashion,

4952
03:17:04,860 --> 03:17:06,960
like you know,
like 20 times more efficient than trying

4953
03:17:06,961 --> 03:17:09,960
to take them over the land.
And so if you don't have,

4954
03:17:10,110 --> 03:17:10,943
especially in three large machines and 
so you'd need that innovation or to 

4955
03:17:13,711 --> 03:17:15,290
create the large machines in the first 
place.

4956
03:17:15,420 --> 03:17:16,330
Exactly.
And,

4957
03:17:16,340 --> 03:17:18,990
and you need somewhere to take it.
You're not trading with anyone.

4958
03:17:18,991 --> 03:17:19,824
If there's,
if you're the one like Atlantean 

4959
03:17:20,941 --> 03:17:23,660
civilization,
no one else is buying your gifts.

4960
03:17:24,270 --> 03:17:25,530
Like it's,
it's,

4961
03:17:25,531 --> 03:17:26,364
it's all horse shit.
It just couldn't happen based on what 

4962
03:17:29,641 --> 03:17:32,080
you need for this thing to actually end 
up exist.

4963
03:17:32,260 --> 03:17:34,100
Right.
In order for an Atlanta is to exist,

4964
03:17:34,130 --> 03:17:36,500
you really have to have a bunch of 
Atlanta lenses.

4965
03:17:36,640 --> 03:17:37,473
Yeah.
Which is more likely that there were 

4966
03:17:39,741 --> 03:17:43,070
some sophisticated civilizations that 
were hit by asteroids.

4967
03:17:44,360 --> 03:17:45,680
Well,
not have evidence for that.

4968
03:17:45,730 --> 03:17:47,060
It's a lot of iridium.
Yeah.

4969
03:17:47,061 --> 03:17:48,680
There's a lot of actual physical 
evidence.

4970
03:17:48,681 --> 03:17:49,690
Yeah.
There's also the stuff,

4971
03:17:49,880 --> 03:17:50,713
it's kind of clear glass.
Well it's the best evidence cause 

4972
03:17:52,731 --> 03:17:55,360
iridium comes from space.
Iridium radium,

4973
03:17:55,370 --> 03:17:58,550
when you find it in large quantities 
indicates and asteroid impact.

4974
03:17:58,920 --> 03:17:59,753
Um,
iridium is very common in space and 

4975
03:18:01,191 --> 03:18:02,024
extremely rare on earth.
So when there's a whole sediment layer 

4976
03:18:04,131 --> 03:18:07,700
of iridium,
it's almost entirely provable.

4977
03:18:08,270 --> 03:18:09,103
That's when it was hit by something,
wouldn't it be some sort of ruins 

4978
03:18:11,181 --> 03:18:13,490
underneath thisone yeah.
They're found a lot of ruins.

4979
03:18:13,540 --> 03:18:14,373
And this is what I was really 
fascinating about how old go Beckley 

4980
03:18:17,030 --> 03:18:18,950
tapis 12,000
plus years old.

4981
03:18:18,950 --> 03:18:20,020
Yeah.
But that didn't get,

4982
03:18:20,120 --> 03:18:22,040
that didn't die because it was hit by an
asteroid.

4983
03:18:22,130 --> 03:18:22,963
Well they,
this is what Graham Hancock and Randall 

4984
03:18:24,171 --> 03:18:25,450
commensalism.
It's speculating.

4985
03:18:25,490 --> 03:18:26,750
That was really primitive.
Okay.

4986
03:18:26,751 --> 03:18:29,570
You don't know that.
But before we go into a massive,

4987
03:18:29,600 --> 03:18:31,820
huge stone columns that are 92 feet 
tall,

4988
03:18:31,821 --> 03:18:35,060
they're carved out of stone by people 
that are hunters and gatherers.

4989
03:18:35,240 --> 03:18:38,510
It's pretty impressive.
But the point being you're hero Tiramisu

4990
03:18:38,511 --> 03:18:39,330
for this,
you know,

4991
03:18:39,330 --> 03:18:40,163
for the thing,
but it's not like a technological 

4992
03:18:41,450 --> 03:18:42,530
achievement.
Well,

4993
03:18:42,560 --> 03:18:44,660
okay,
what is a PR impressive?

4994
03:18:44,720 --> 03:18:45,860
Machu Picchu?
Impressive.

4995
03:18:45,861 --> 03:18:46,790
It's pretty impressive,
right?

4996
03:18:46,791 --> 03:18:48,190
That's not ulta.
Well,

4997
03:18:48,191 --> 03:18:49,920
it's thousands.
A couple thousand years old.

4998
03:18:49,921 --> 03:18:52,200
It's 100 1400 something.
Okay.

4999
03:18:52,210 --> 03:18:53,043
I don't think that's true.
And I don't think they know that for a 

5000
03:18:54,731 --> 03:18:56,890
fact.
And this is one of the speculations that

5001
03:18:56,891 --> 03:18:57,724
Graham Hancock and Randall Cros that 
have presented is that the evidence of 

5002
03:19:00,521 --> 03:19:04,870
this nuclear glass,
which only exists on impact sites before

5003
03:19:04,871 --> 03:19:05,704
you go to your phone,
listen to maybe so you can understand 

5004
03:19:06,731 --> 03:19:08,830
what I'm saying,
impact sites,

5005
03:19:09,190 --> 03:19:10,023
um,
where meteors hit or where they've done 

5006
03:19:12,731 --> 03:19:13,564
nuclear tests.

5007
03:19:13,600 --> 03:19:16,060
So they found this stuff and micro 
diamonds,

5008
03:19:16,061 --> 03:19:19,030
evidence of massive impacts.
But when they do core samples,

5009
03:19:19,031 --> 03:19:20,980
they founded at 10 and 12,000
years,

5010
03:19:21,220 --> 03:19:22,053
which is essentially the same time 
period as the end of the ice age did a 

5011
03:19:25,121 --> 03:19:28,390
huge podcast on it with geologists.
They don't know though.

5012
03:19:28,391 --> 03:19:29,950
Here's the thing,
when you talk to an expert,

5013
03:19:30,130 --> 03:19:30,963
this is pure speculation.
There's no carbon dated evidence that 

5014
03:19:34,031 --> 03:19:37,060
points to that age where as there is 
with the Sphinx.

5015
03:19:37,090 --> 03:19:39,790
So with the Sphinx,
or excuse me with the Great Pyramids,

5016
03:19:40,040 --> 03:19:40,873
the Great Pyramid of Giza,
they've done some tests on some of the 

5017
03:19:43,391 --> 03:19:44,224
sediment and some of the stuff in 
between the stones and they brought it 

5018
03:19:46,601 --> 03:19:48,490
to about 2,500
BC.

5019
03:19:48,900 --> 03:19:50,260
Crazy specifically.
Yeah.

5020
03:19:50,261 --> 03:19:53,130
They found a bunch of stuff that shows 
without,

5021
03:19:53,140 --> 03:19:55,170
with a very high,
uh,

5022
03:19:55,570 --> 03:19:59,650
high degree of possibility or 
probability that it's around 2,500

5023
03:19:59,651 --> 03:20:00,590
BC.
Yeah.

5024
03:20:00,670 --> 03:20:04,660
What they've done with this [inaudible] 
name of the massive impacts.

5025
03:20:05,010 --> 03:20:05,410
Well,
there's,

5026
03:20:05,410 --> 03:20:06,430
yeah.
With Geezer,

5027
03:20:06,431 --> 03:20:07,264
right?
Yeah.

5028
03:20:07,630 --> 03:20:08,351
But there's a,
with,

5029
03:20:08,351 --> 03:20:08,961
um,
rather,

5030
03:20:08,961 --> 03:20:09,794
uh,
the great pyramid,

5031
03:20:10,150 --> 03:20:10,983
but there's,
there's plenty of evidence that there 

5032
03:20:13,271 --> 03:20:17,740
was some sort of a massive event around 
10,000

5033
03:20:17,741 --> 03:20:19,060
and 12,000
years ago.

5034
03:20:19,210 --> 03:20:20,043
And what their belief is that this is 
where all the stories of Atlanta has 

5035
03:20:22,181 --> 03:20:24,280
come from.
This is where all these stories of these

5036
03:20:24,281 --> 03:20:25,114
great civilizations that were wiped out 
come from is that most likely we 

5037
03:20:28,601 --> 03:20:29,434
experienced a big die off and a lot of 
people were affected by these disasters 

5038
03:20:33,521 --> 03:20:37,510
and catastrophes.
That coincided with asteroidal impacts.

5039
03:20:38,170 --> 03:20:39,003
Maybe.
But I mean we know where the stories of 

5040
03:20:40,390 --> 03:20:43,390
Atlantis come from Plato.
Right?

5041
03:20:43,420 --> 03:20:45,380
But,
and he had gone to Egypt and,

5042
03:20:45,820 --> 03:20:47,090
and been told us,
but it's all,

5043
03:20:47,260 --> 03:20:48,960
I mean it's not looking real thing.
It's not,

5044
03:20:48,970 --> 03:20:50,920
I mean he,
he said yeah 9,000

5045
03:20:50,921 --> 03:20:53,350
years before the present and that they 
built the thing then he was,

5046
03:20:53,750 --> 03:20:56,100
that's what's crazy is that this is 
Alex.

5047
03:20:56,100 --> 03:20:59,200
But it does coincide with the time of 
the impact.

5048
03:20:59,410 --> 03:21:00,310
For example,
9,000

5049
03:21:00,311 --> 03:21:02,340
years ago there wasn't an Egypt,
you know,

5050
03:21:02,440 --> 03:21:03,460
from Plato Plato's,
you know,

5051
03:21:03,461 --> 03:21:06,970
from like 2,500
years ago,

5052
03:21:06,971 --> 03:21:08,470
from now,
like 500 BC,

5053
03:21:08,830 --> 03:21:10,750
like 9,000
years pulled out that will's new Egypt.

5054
03:21:10,900 --> 03:21:12,820
There was no efforts.
And yet the story involves,

5055
03:21:12,940 --> 03:21:13,773
that's not necessarily true either.
Robert Schoch cause the geologists that 

5056
03:21:16,841 --> 03:21:19,650
have a Boston University has done a lot 
of um,

5057
03:21:20,050 --> 03:21:22,380
investigation on the,
the,

5058
03:21:22,690 --> 03:21:24,820
the temple that the Sphinx was carved 
out of,

5059
03:21:24,821 --> 03:21:25,654
like where the,
the Sphinx is the walls of the temple 

5060
03:21:27,910 --> 03:21:30,580
and he believes it's from water erosion.
There's this,

5061
03:21:30,581 --> 03:21:32,740
these fissures and he's deep,
uh,

5062
03:21:32,830 --> 03:21:33,663
erosion marks that they believe indicate
that the temple of Sphinx or the area 

5063
03:21:38,291 --> 03:21:41,950
that's carved out of is far older than 
the same.

5064
03:21:42,010 --> 03:21:45,070
Like they know that the Great Pyramid of
Giza is two,

5065
03:21:45,380 --> 03:21:46,213
500 BC,

5066
03:21:46,340 --> 03:21:48,410
but they fail,
always attribute the Sphinx of being the

5067
03:21:48,411 --> 03:21:51,320
same timeline.
Dr Robert Schoch from Boston University,

5068
03:21:51,321 --> 03:21:52,850
he says,
that's not the case.

5069
03:21:52,851 --> 03:21:53,684
He said,
what you're looking at is thousands of 

5070
03:21:55,130 --> 03:21:55,963
years of rainfall and they have hundreds
of geologists that have signed off on 

5071
03:21:58,221 --> 03:21:59,300
this.
This is not like,

5072
03:21:59,580 --> 03:22:00,413
and there's,
he goes over the physical evidence of 

5073
03:22:02,721 --> 03:22:05,360
these fissures and how they're made.
He's like,

5074
03:22:05,361 --> 03:22:06,650
as a geologist,
I can tell you,

5075
03:22:06,651 --> 03:22:08,840
you are looking at thousands of years a 
rainfall.

5076
03:22:09,050 --> 03:22:13,310
The last time there was series rainfall 
in the Nile Valley was about 7,000

5077
03:22:13,311 --> 03:22:14,144
BC.
So what he's saying is it's entirely 

5078
03:22:16,281 --> 03:22:17,114
possible that there have been many 
different civilizations that lived in 

5079
03:22:20,061 --> 03:22:20,894
this area and that Egypt is a 
civilization that might have gone back 

5080
03:22:24,350 --> 03:22:27,650
many,
many thousands of years longer than just

5081
03:22:27,651 --> 03:22:29,390
the construction of the Great Pyramid of
Giza.

5082
03:22:29,840 --> 03:22:31,610
Uh,
I wasn't talking about the Great Pyramid

5083
03:22:31,610 --> 03:22:32,443
of Giza really,
but that's Egypt will live us just a 

5084
03:22:34,100 --> 03:22:35,240
monument in Egypt.

5085
03:22:35,290 --> 03:22:36,123
Right.
But Egypt is a place that did exist 

5086
03:22:38,720 --> 03:22:39,860
10,000
years ago.

5087
03:22:39,861 --> 03:22:40,880
12,000
years ago.

5088
03:22:40,970 --> 03:22:41,751
50,000
years.

5089
03:22:41,751 --> 03:22:43,280
Because I like cars,
but don't say it.

5090
03:22:43,281 --> 03:22:45,360
No it didn't.
Cause you don't really know well,

5091
03:22:46,100 --> 03:22:47,690
but you're saying no it didn't.
I'll tell you,

5092
03:22:47,750 --> 03:22:48,583
are you in Egyptologist do you you had 
boots on the ground and talk to the 

5093
03:22:51,411 --> 03:22:52,910
people over there?
We don't really know.

5094
03:22:52,911 --> 03:22:54,950
Right.
Well he doesn't know what I'm about say,

5095
03:22:55,310 --> 03:22:57,060
but you said no it didn't.
Well yeah,

5096
03:22:57,061 --> 03:22:58,460
but the,
the state of Egypt.

5097
03:22:58,570 --> 03:22:59,403
Okay.
Okay.

5098
03:22:59,410 --> 03:23:02,090
Like as I'm not saying they weren't 
people living in the area.

5099
03:23:02,110 --> 03:23:03,590
There aren't,
daddy would've been people living in the

5100
03:23:03,591 --> 03:23:04,424
area.
Right.

5101
03:23:04,430 --> 03:23:06,410
But calling it Egypt are saying,
yeah,

5102
03:23:06,411 --> 03:23:08,540
they wouldn't know co when did they 
start calling it Egypt.

5103
03:23:08,600 --> 03:23:09,650
Oh,
I'd have to look that up.

5104
03:23:09,651 --> 03:23:11,090
Put it in there.
But um,

5105
03:23:11,390 --> 03:23:15,320
the like we can tell I'll kill,
just can tell like,

5106
03:23:15,860 --> 03:23:17,590
um,
like when the,

5107
03:23:17,591 --> 03:23:18,424
when of grains with first domesticated 
and things like this and you're never 

5108
03:23:20,841 --> 03:23:23,220
going to have a state without farming,
you're never going to happen.

5109
03:23:23,420 --> 03:23:25,590
You're not going to have like a hunter 
gatherer,

5110
03:23:25,610 --> 03:23:29,720
a state where they have a government and
you need a surplus of food to be able to

5111
03:23:29,721 --> 03:23:31,000
support,
um,

5112
03:23:31,100 --> 03:23:32,110
uh,
pre uh,

5113
03:23:32,150 --> 03:23:34,460
preached the cloths in the US a 
bureaucratic class.

5114
03:23:34,520 --> 03:23:35,353
Right,
right.

5115
03:23:35,390 --> 03:23:38,900
And to get something built,
you need these things.

5116
03:23:38,930 --> 03:23:40,760
Right.
Which I mean,

5117
03:23:40,761 --> 03:23:43,670
not necessarily calling off stone.
Like if you're going to build a pyramid,

5118
03:23:43,671 --> 03:23:44,504
yes,
you need these things.

5119
03:23:44,750 --> 03:23:47,420
Maybe calling us thinks that's something
tribesmen could do.

5120
03:23:47,760 --> 03:23:50,620
It ain't even cold cocked bell tappy out
of it's pronounced go back clean.

5121
03:23:50,660 --> 03:23:51,493
Yeah.
Correctly.

5122
03:23:51,550 --> 03:23:51,960
Uh,
that,

5123
03:23:51,960 --> 03:23:53,470
that can easily believe that like,
you know,

5124
03:23:53,480 --> 03:23:55,900
nomadic a hunter gatherers,
they could,

5125
03:23:55,940 --> 03:23:57,060
they could have crossed the that cause 
you just,

5126
03:23:57,120 --> 03:23:58,910
just basically sanding and chipping.
It's done.

5127
03:23:59,300 --> 03:24:00,940
Well.
They've moved them to it.

5128
03:24:00,960 --> 03:24:01,793
These are huge chunks of stone that were
done back when they didn't have a 

5129
03:24:04,731 --> 03:24:06,110
surplus of resources.

5130
03:24:06,950 --> 03:24:09,290
The hunters and gatherers and you've 
done it wrong.

5131
03:24:09,291 --> 03:24:10,124
I'm not saying it wasn't like a 
monumental achievement for the time and 

5132
03:24:12,681 --> 03:24:13,514
the resources obviously was,
but we know that they weren't farming 

5133
03:24:16,610 --> 03:24:19,700
well.
It might be right about that,

5134
03:24:19,730 --> 03:24:20,563
but we might not be right.
You're talking about an incredibly long 

5135
03:24:22,821 --> 03:24:24,050
time ago.
12,000

5136
03:24:24,051 --> 03:24:24,884
years ago is a long time and whatever 
evidence would be left is really 

5137
03:24:28,461 --> 03:24:30,120
probably been absorbed by the earth by 
though.

5138
03:24:30,210 --> 03:24:31,970
Oh,
maybe.

5139
03:24:31,971 --> 03:24:32,804
But I mean we can't sit here and 
speculate about something that might've 

5140
03:24:35,480 --> 03:24:38,000
happened if we've gotten a weapon.
But that's exactly what we're doing.

5141
03:24:38,001 --> 03:24:40,640
If we're saying that they were 
definitely hunter and gatherers,

5142
03:24:40,641 --> 03:24:41,474
we don't know assumption,
but we do know is they were capable of 

5143
03:24:44,401 --> 03:24:49,080
making these incredibly massive,
complicated structures 12,000

5144
03:24:49,081 --> 03:24:51,100
years ago for sure is the Sphinx.
And infant.

5145
03:24:51,110 --> 03:24:52,380
We mess up.
We're now talking about that.

5146
03:24:52,380 --> 03:24:54,120
We're talking about gold Beckley tappy 
but yeah,

5147
03:24:54,121 --> 03:24:54,954
they had the space isn't big.
It's fucking huge and for you to say 

5148
03:24:57,631 --> 03:24:58,464
that it's very disturbing because 
they've only uncovered 5% of it or 10% 

5149
03:25:01,860 --> 03:25:03,600
it's massive for further than 
comparable.

5150
03:25:03,700 --> 03:25:06,630
Not Quite big studies,
but this is the problem.

5151
03:25:06,631 --> 03:25:10,160
You don't know a lot about it,
but you're automatically jumping to this

5152
03:25:10,161 --> 03:25:13,980
skeptical but you haven't.
If you didn't think it was big.

5153
03:25:15,320 --> 03:25:17,610
I just can't remember off the top of my 
head exact the problem.

5154
03:25:17,611 --> 03:25:19,590
But you're so convinced in your 
argument,

5155
03:25:19,591 --> 03:25:20,424
but you're not really ever really spent 
a whole lot of time thinking about a 

5156
03:25:23,081 --> 03:25:25,020
carving stone man that's not very 
advanced.

5157
03:25:25,021 --> 03:25:25,854
Just carving stone.
They're carving stern with three 

5158
03:25:27,541 --> 03:25:28,374
dimensional objects in the stone,
meaning like lizards that are on the 

5159
03:25:30,451 --> 03:25:32,400
outside of it.
19 foot hauls,

5160
03:25:32,730 --> 03:25:35,550
tall stone columns and concentric 
circles.

5161
03:25:35,780 --> 03:25:37,260
Is this,
is there a huge structure,

5162
03:25:37,730 --> 03:25:38,563
look at the hiring,
any particular the technology today it 

5163
03:25:40,921 --> 03:25:42,210
does to move those things?

5164
03:25:42,340 --> 03:25:43,173
Look,
we'll look at the image on the far 

5165
03:25:43,951 --> 03:25:44,784
right.
That's what they have figured out so 

5166
03:25:46,141 --> 03:25:48,030
far.
By using radar underground,

5167
03:25:48,031 --> 03:25:51,030
we look at the size of this room.
That is huge.

5168
03:25:51,060 --> 03:25:53,580
It's fucking shiny,
primitive.

5169
03:25:54,120 --> 03:25:54,953
It's just stone.
It's not that primitive for someone to 

5170
03:25:57,691 --> 03:26:00,840
make something out of stone that Dave,
it's really impressive.

5171
03:26:00,841 --> 03:26:02,260
Right?
It must've been primitive and turn,

5172
03:26:02,270 --> 03:26:04,290
but like they don't have a TV.
Is that what you mean?

5173
03:26:04,291 --> 03:26:06,690
It isn't like the like for example,
I'm sure if they,

5174
03:26:07,230 --> 03:26:08,063
I'm sure if they went and did some sort 
of like super high resolution scans on 

5175
03:26:11,971 --> 03:26:13,110
it or something like that,
they'd be like,

5176
03:26:13,111 --> 03:26:13,361
right,
okay.

5177
03:26:13,361 --> 03:26:14,940
This has been coughed with other stone 
tools.

5178
03:26:14,941 --> 03:26:15,774
You know,
they can tell these be called Capa 

5179
03:26:16,440 --> 03:26:17,273
tools,
whatever.

5180
03:26:17,460 --> 03:26:20,350
This wouldn't have been carved by a 
couple of tools.

5181
03:26:20,351 --> 03:26:21,031
You know,
he knows.

5182
03:26:21,031 --> 03:26:23,160
He don't even know that when it comes to
the great pyramid.

5183
03:26:23,160 --> 03:26:24,750
In fact,
there's a lot of people that speculate,

5184
03:26:24,751 --> 03:26:25,584
they figured out a way to make some sort
of a diamond tipped late drill in order 

5185
03:26:29,491 --> 03:26:30,301
to make the,
uh,

5186
03:26:30,301 --> 03:26:31,134
the king's chamber.
And some of the sarcophagus is if they 

5187
03:26:32,701 --> 03:26:33,534
look at us not fringe,
they don't really know how they carved 

5188
03:26:35,281 --> 03:26:37,290
out some of the stone in the,
there's,

5189
03:26:37,291 --> 03:26:38,820
there's a simple thought,
two pages.

5190
03:26:38,890 --> 03:26:39,723
There's a simple vase in Egypt they 
don't understand because it's carved 

5191
03:26:42,901 --> 03:26:43,734
completely at a one piece of stone,
but it's so intricate and so hard that 

5192
03:26:47,521 --> 03:26:48,354
they've made this incredibly thin lip on
this vase and they've gone deep inside 

5193
03:26:51,751 --> 03:26:53,550
of it and the whole thing is entirely 
smooth.

5194
03:26:53,700 --> 03:26:55,140
They really don't know how the fuck they
did it.

5195
03:26:55,290 --> 03:26:57,390
Probably some paper.
I'm rubbing it patients,

5196
03:26:57,420 --> 03:26:59,340
they can't get your fingers inside of 
this thing.

5197
03:26:59,341 --> 03:27:01,050
I'm talking about an actual vas.
Yeah.

5198
03:27:01,050 --> 03:27:04,230
It's very,
very confusing to modern archeologists.

5199
03:27:04,231 --> 03:27:06,140
This is not a got engine.
Anyway,

5200
03:27:06,300 --> 03:27:08,250
I don't know about that.
I was talking about what I'm saying.

5201
03:27:09,210 --> 03:27:12,060
What is an ancient advanced civilization
like?

5202
03:27:12,061 --> 03:27:14,250
Don't you agree that the Parthenon,
the Acropolis,

5203
03:27:14,400 --> 03:27:15,233
that's an advanced civilization?
Not particularly for the time for what 

5204
03:27:17,521 --> 03:27:20,160
they,
for what they accomplished is amazing.

5205
03:27:20,390 --> 03:27:23,550
They said none of great massive stones 
that are cut in place.

5206
03:27:23,551 --> 03:27:26,330
The beautiful columns,
fifth century.

5207
03:27:26,630 --> 03:27:27,463
Okay.
Well then what pays in advance 

5208
03:27:28,831 --> 03:27:31,530
civilization if that's not advance?
That's the point,

5209
03:27:31,531 --> 03:27:32,364
isn't it?
Can you talk calling your vans pathogen 

5210
03:27:34,890 --> 03:27:35,723
to as a,
the glorification of athletes over its 

5211
03:27:37,021 --> 03:27:37,910
empire,
right,

5212
03:27:38,120 --> 03:27:38,953
right.
It was not that these things didn't 

5213
03:27:39,931 --> 03:27:40,764
already exist.
It's he wanted to make Athens look 

5214
03:27:42,641 --> 03:27:44,290
special in the eyes of the rest of the 
world.

5215
03:27:44,810 --> 03:27:45,643
This is what I'm confused.
Like what year did this happen and when 

5216
03:27:48,521 --> 03:27:52,210
do you consider people to be fans of out
on the full 60 be seals?

5217
03:27:53,300 --> 03:27:55,360
I should know that.
Advanced civilization.

5218
03:27:56,020 --> 03:27:57,280
No.
Come on,

5219
03:27:57,281 --> 03:27:58,114
man.
If that didn't exist anywhere and then 

5220
03:28:00,071 --> 03:28:02,550
all of a sudden may send 1000 years ago,
then yeah,

5221
03:28:02,560 --> 03:28:04,090
but if 10,000
years ago,

5222
03:28:04,210 --> 03:28:07,240
something like something like,
uh,

5223
03:28:07,300 --> 03:28:11,260
the Parthenon and the Acropolis,
if we could prove that 10,000

5224
03:28:11,261 --> 03:28:14,170
years before anybody had done anything 
else that that existed,

5225
03:28:14,200 --> 03:28:15,730
you'd be blown away by that,
right?

5226
03:28:15,760 --> 03:28:16,780
Yeah,
but shocking.

5227
03:28:16,810 --> 03:28:17,190
Yeah.
No,

5228
03:28:17,190 --> 03:28:19,630
the,
the [inaudible] may be 10,000

5229
03:28:19,631 --> 03:28:20,920
BC.
That would be incredible.

5230
03:28:21,010 --> 03:28:21,521
Right?
Right.

5231
03:28:21,521 --> 03:28:22,354
It would be right.
But a bunch of upright stones that have 

5232
03:28:23,651 --> 03:28:27,950
been nicely carved to have animals on 
them and stuff like that,

5233
03:28:27,951 --> 03:28:28,784
that just that massive stones in 19 feet
tall and concentric circles all in this 

5234
03:28:33,430 --> 03:28:34,263
huge structure hens in Britain.
We know how they made it and we know 

5235
03:28:36,651 --> 03:28:37,640
where the students came from.
You know,

5236
03:28:37,641 --> 03:28:39,580
having gotten the,
you're one of those dudes,

5237
03:28:39,880 --> 03:28:41,600
well you're one of those dudes that 
history that,

5238
03:28:41,650 --> 03:28:42,483
no,
not just read history cause you don't 

5239
03:28:43,391 --> 03:28:44,460
know anything about go back.

5240
03:28:44,460 --> 03:28:47,580
They tempe and yet you're so,
so you just your throat to me.

5241
03:28:47,590 --> 03:28:49,840
But I'm trying to tell you what,
Oh I interrupt you.

5242
03:28:49,841 --> 03:28:53,770
You're adorable.
You keep going with these things.

5243
03:28:53,860 --> 03:28:54,693
You really don't even know anything 
about this area and yet your money by 

5244
03:28:58,271 --> 03:29:00,940
hunters and gatherers,
there's a lot of argument one way or the

5245
03:29:00,941 --> 03:29:01,774
other about it.
It's entirely possible that they had 

5246
03:29:05,260 --> 03:29:06,520
discovered farming.
I guess.

5247
03:29:06,521 --> 03:29:07,354
I mean that,
that's the area that farming was a 

5248
03:29:08,560 --> 03:29:10,240
originally,
originally as part of the problem,

5249
03:29:10,241 --> 03:29:11,680
right?
When you get to 12,000

5250
03:29:11,681 --> 03:29:14,230
years ago,
who knows what the fuck isn't it?

5251
03:29:14,380 --> 03:29:17,710
And we think they knew things and then 
we find out that they knew more.

5252
03:29:17,730 --> 03:29:18,563
I mean this is mostly covered in ice.
How could you get an advanced 

5253
03:29:23,141 --> 03:29:24,460
civilization?
Heart of the earth?

5254
03:29:24,490 --> 03:29:24,911
Yeah.
Yes.

5255
03:29:24,911 --> 03:29:25,744
Mostly covered in Nice,
like when you're dealing with North 

5256
03:29:27,281 --> 03:29:28,240
America,
right?

5257
03:29:28,300 --> 03:29:30,160
North America 12,000
hours ago.

5258
03:29:30,730 --> 03:29:31,563
Big parts of it.
But on the south to felt like a band in 

5259
03:29:34,481 --> 03:29:35,314
the middle of this.
Yeah.

5260
03:29:35,480 --> 03:29:36,313
I mean we're was posted.
What do they think Turkey was like back 

5261
03:29:39,341 --> 03:29:40,550
then?
Because this is where it go.

5262
03:29:40,551 --> 03:29:43,750
Beckley cafes in Turkey,
what they think Turkey was like 12,000

5263
03:29:43,751 --> 03:29:45,490
years ago.
And the problem is if that,

5264
03:29:45,760 --> 03:29:48,220
if they can carbon date it absolutely to
12,000

5265
03:29:48,221 --> 03:29:49,840
years ago,
they know it was covered up.

5266
03:29:49,841 --> 03:29:52,390
It was intentionally covered 12,000
years ago.

5267
03:29:52,391 --> 03:29:53,960
This is the story of,
go back to Cathy.

5268
03:29:54,840 --> 03:29:55,673
Um,
when was it constructed that they don't 

5269
03:29:57,191 --> 03:29:59,320
know because stone you can't carbon 
date,

5270
03:29:59,350 --> 03:30:01,030
like the way they did it with the 
Egyptian pyramids,

5271
03:30:01,031 --> 03:30:03,160
they got the material in between each 
stone.

5272
03:30:03,690 --> 03:30:05,720
So I can kind of think they know,
you know,

5273
03:30:05,750 --> 03:30:07,870
like say 30,000
years ago,

5274
03:30:07,871 --> 03:30:08,704
20,000
years ago,

5275
03:30:08,980 --> 03:30:10,630
I could,
I could believe in a certain area of the

5276
03:30:10,631 --> 03:30:11,441
world,
the,

5277
03:30:11,441 --> 03:30:14,800
a bunch of tribesmen who hunter 
gathering maybe,

5278
03:30:14,980 --> 03:30:17,500
maybe seasonally nomadic,
um,

5279
03:30:18,190 --> 03:30:19,810
you know,
for a hundred years,

5280
03:30:19,990 --> 03:30:20,711
you know,
maybe it was a,

5281
03:30:20,711 --> 03:30:22,030
you know,
as a religious duty.

5282
03:30:22,031 --> 03:30:23,470
They considered it to be,
I mean,

5283
03:30:23,490 --> 03:30:24,323
this thing,
stonehenge was built over a period of 

5284
03:30:25,960 --> 03:30:27,370
like,
look thousand years.

5285
03:30:27,371 --> 03:30:28,204
I mean,
it took a long time to just put these 

5286
03:30:29,471 --> 03:30:30,950
fucking stones.
So,

5287
03:30:31,050 --> 03:30:31,883
I mean,
we don't know how long this would have 

5288
03:30:33,371 --> 03:30:35,530
taken,
but to have a bunch of carved stones up,

5289
03:30:35,531 --> 03:30:36,730
right.
Even if they're big,

5290
03:30:37,090 --> 03:30:40,040
they'll just requires more people that 
that's not great technological

5291
03:30:40,040 --> 03:30:41,360
feat.
That's the thing.

5292
03:30:41,361 --> 03:30:43,430
It's not a blood is a technological 
feat.

5293
03:30:43,440 --> 03:30:45,230
If Marlene,
the Acropolis,

5294
03:30:45,610 --> 03:30:48,380
there's not a technological feat.
It was a technological feat,

5295
03:30:48,381 --> 03:30:51,230
but it wasn't particularly unique to the
world at the time.

5296
03:30:51,231 --> 03:30:52,064
In fact,
the Persians in the Babylonians and 

5297
03:30:52,731 --> 03:30:53,564
Syrians,
they've been done of thousands years 

5298
03:30:54,590 --> 03:30:56,840
before that.
The Greeks were catching up when the,

5299
03:30:56,980 --> 03:30:57,813
doesn't that then support the idea that 
go Beckley Tapi is even more unique 

5300
03:31:01,581 --> 03:31:04,890
because it was incredible as a name.
No,

5301
03:31:04,990 --> 03:31:05,511
no.
That's all right.

5302
03:31:05,511 --> 03:31:07,460
It's that is an advanced civilization 
then.

5303
03:31:07,530 --> 03:31:07,860
Well,
no.

5304
03:31:07,860 --> 03:31:08,420
Well,
yeah.

5305
03:31:08,420 --> 03:31:10,580
I mean it's advanced for the rest of the
world,

5306
03:31:10,610 --> 03:31:12,830
but it's,
it's pretty advanced for today.

5307
03:31:12,831 --> 03:31:16,340
If we wanted to build something like 
that today would take massive resources.

5308
03:31:16,580 --> 03:31:17,413
It would take huge machines.
It would take a gigantic group of 

5309
03:31:19,731 --> 03:31:21,810
engineers.
That's how convenient project.

5310
03:31:22,100 --> 03:31:24,560
That's out of convenience.
What do you mean out of convenience?

5311
03:31:24,560 --> 03:31:25,393
Why that's missing that?
How was it out of convenience when you 

5312
03:31:27,321 --> 03:31:28,154
get 19 foot tall stones that are,
because you don't really get loads in 

5313
03:31:31,781 --> 03:31:33,320
there.
He pulls him in a circle.

5314
03:31:33,380 --> 03:31:34,640
I mean,
it's a lot of work.

5315
03:31:34,790 --> 03:31:35,571
Of course it is.
Yeah.

5316
03:31:35,571 --> 03:31:37,880
That's why would you use machines?
Because it'd just be a lot of work.

5317
03:31:38,210 --> 03:31:40,970
It's not as simple as you just use 
machines,

5318
03:31:40,971 --> 03:31:41,804
like you'd have to get very specific 
massive machines that are incredibly 

5319
03:31:44,781 --> 03:31:45,614
difficult to engineerings and these 
people did that without any of that 

5320
03:31:47,571 --> 03:31:47,860
shit.
Yeah,

5321
03:31:47,860 --> 03:31:49,970
they did the ropes and pretty easily 
logs,

5322
03:31:50,510 --> 03:31:53,060
prob probably prominent police actually,
but the ropes in logs,

5323
03:31:53,090 --> 03:31:55,660
who knows how the fuck they did it,
but that's what we're supposed to be.

5324
03:31:55,690 --> 03:31:58,070
There was no wheel back then.
They'll probably wasn't,

5325
03:31:59,290 --> 03:32:01,760
I mean it's pretty spectacular.
Yeah,

5326
03:32:01,761 --> 03:32:02,211
yeah.
No,

5327
03:32:02,211 --> 03:32:03,200
no,
it's okay.

5328
03:32:03,201 --> 03:32:03,591
Yeah.
Right.

5329
03:32:03,591 --> 03:32:03,740
Okay.

5330
03:32:03,740 --> 03:32:04,573
So let me,
so I'm not trying to take away the 

5331
03:32:06,921 --> 03:32:07,754
amount of effort involved in building 
this thing and the willpower to do it 

5332
03:32:11,630 --> 03:32:12,463
and the manpower to do it.
What are you trying to say and not 

5333
03:32:14,870 --> 03:32:17,930
indicative of an advanced civilization?
What,

5334
03:32:17,931 --> 03:32:20,060
when I think,
I think he's a definition of advanced.

5335
03:32:20,061 --> 03:32:20,894
For example,
like I would consider an advanced 

5336
03:32:22,460 --> 03:32:23,293
civilization have writing.
I would consider them to have 

5337
03:32:24,891 --> 03:32:26,180
metallurgy.
I would consider,

5338
03:32:26,750 --> 03:32:28,370
I wouldn't even call this advanced this,
I mean this is,

5339
03:32:28,371 --> 03:32:29,480
this is,
this puts them,

5340
03:32:29,900 --> 03:32:33,200
this puts them where we were 4,000
years ago,

5341
03:32:33,310 --> 03:32:34,340
you know,
as a species.

5342
03:32:34,341 --> 03:32:36,290
So advanced is like,
uh,

5343
03:32:36,690 --> 03:32:38,240
it's all,
it's all well,

5344
03:32:38,241 --> 03:32:38,610
yeah.
Well,

5345
03:32:38,610 --> 03:32:39,710
I mean it's all relative,
isn't it?

5346
03:32:39,711 --> 03:32:42,380
So it's like,
I mean what I mean,

5347
03:32:42,381 --> 03:32:43,180
yeah,
I mean if,

5348
03:32:43,180 --> 03:32:43,730
if,
if,

5349
03:32:43,730 --> 03:32:45,920
if you want to speculate,
they might have been a civilization like

5350
03:32:45,921 --> 03:32:50,921
pre ice age or during the ice age that 
had writing and metallurgy and you know,

5351
03:32:52,940 --> 03:32:53,773
great cities and international trade 
agriculture also all this sort of stuff 

5352
03:32:57,081 --> 03:32:58,850
that we would look,
if you look at the Roman Empire,

5353
03:32:58,970 --> 03:33:02,150
we see if we take them as the model of 
an advanced civilization.

5354
03:33:02,210 --> 03:33:03,830
Right.
And when I say advanced,

5355
03:33:04,070 --> 03:33:07,740
we mean not as advanced as we are now.
[inaudible] right.

5356
03:33:08,030 --> 03:33:09,950
Well that's what everyone speculates 
about.

5357
03:33:09,951 --> 03:33:12,100
Atlanta says,
well no one ever thinks that Atlanta was

5358
03:33:12,110 --> 03:33:14,640
like today.
They think some crazy things.

5359
03:33:14,641 --> 03:33:16,490
Some people really,
some people,

5360
03:33:16,491 --> 03:33:17,440
I mean,
yeah,

5361
03:33:17,810 --> 03:33:19,100
but um,
yeah,

5362
03:33:19,540 --> 03:33:21,080
this is,
we should should've been more specific.

5363
03:33:21,440 --> 03:33:22,370
Um,
but yeah,

5364
03:33:22,371 --> 03:33:22,750
I mean,
don't,

5365
03:33:22,750 --> 03:33:24,860
don't get me wrong.
I'm sure that for the time,

5366
03:33:25,100 --> 03:33:25,933
like when a run around and tribe came 
over the hill and they saw go back to 

5367
03:33:28,431 --> 03:33:30,100
the teepee and it was incredible,
it was like,

5368
03:33:30,140 --> 03:33:32,000
ah,
the gods have built this,

5369
03:33:32,001 --> 03:33:33,170
you know,
that's what they would have thought.

5370
03:33:33,171 --> 03:33:34,004
I'm sure you know,
to them it would have relatively been 

5371
03:33:36,050 --> 03:33:37,040
incredible,
you know,

5372
03:33:37,070 --> 03:33:37,920
am I'm doing wrong?

5373
03:33:38,090 --> 03:33:38,923
I know I don't want to take away the 
achievement for the people who made it 

5374
03:33:40,371 --> 03:33:43,100
cause it's unbelievably good.
And you know,

5375
03:33:43,230 --> 03:33:45,030
especially for the time,
but like if,

5376
03:33:45,040 --> 03:33:46,950
if they didn't have white mel tools then
have writing,

5377
03:33:46,951 --> 03:33:49,470
they didn't have agriculture,
I wouldn't call that advance.

5378
03:33:49,471 --> 03:33:51,930
I'd just call that a loss of work for a 
premise of civilization.

5379
03:33:51,931 --> 03:33:52,764
And the same with this stone henge would
have been the real problem is we don't 

5380
03:33:55,291 --> 03:33:59,370
really know what they had.
And until more evidence gets uncovered,

5381
03:33:59,371 --> 03:34:00,600
they,
they're just guessing.

5382
03:34:00,660 --> 03:34:03,630
They have some carbon dating.
They know that the stones exist.

5383
03:34:03,780 --> 03:34:04,613
They don't even know.
I mean they didn't even know about this 

5384
03:34:06,391 --> 03:34:07,224
until 1990 something.
I mean they found it in the 90s but me 

5385
03:34:10,040 --> 03:34:11,880
know all of northern Europe,
you know,

5386
03:34:11,940 --> 03:34:12,773
stone circles hinges me or whatever.
Well they find more of those now than 

5387
03:34:16,321 --> 03:34:17,460
ever before with satellites.

5388
03:34:17,460 --> 03:34:18,293
Right?
Yeah.

5389
03:34:18,340 --> 03:34:21,240
Seen the ones that they're finding now 
in the Amazon and they're like,

5390
03:34:21,241 --> 03:34:23,580
what the fuck is this?
They're finding all these structures,

5391
03:34:23,640 --> 03:34:25,380
the channels,
and you send me the link to that because

5392
03:34:25,381 --> 03:34:28,200
that sounds interesting.
Well that's the lost city of z.

5393
03:34:28,201 --> 03:34:32,030
You know about that right now there's a,
there was a guy who went looking,

5394
03:34:32,050 --> 03:34:34,410
he was an explorer,
went looking for the loss series,

5395
03:34:34,440 --> 03:34:35,273
city of z in the Amazon.
It was like a mythical lost city and he 

5396
03:34:38,981 --> 03:34:39,814
got eaten by cannibals.
Apparently there's some movie that's 

5397
03:34:41,731 --> 03:34:44,190
coming out about him right now that's 
racist.

5398
03:34:44,640 --> 03:34:46,530
No,
they were white counts.

5399
03:34:46,850 --> 03:34:47,960
I'm about that.
Um,

5400
03:34:48,250 --> 03:34:49,680
but I'll post privilege.
It was,

5401
03:34:49,681 --> 03:34:50,514
um,
yeah,

5402
03:34:50,850 --> 03:34:51,683
it was speculated that before the Ama,
well that's the other thing that came 

5403
03:34:54,301 --> 03:34:55,134
out recently.
The Amazon was covered in the ocean 

5404
03:34:56,880 --> 03:34:58,820
somewhere around 10 million years ago or
something.

5405
03:34:59,460 --> 03:35:03,060
But they think that these people had 
some sort of,

5406
03:35:03,061 --> 03:35:04,500
you know,
for the time again,

5407
03:35:04,530 --> 03:35:06,250
what is an advanced civilization?
Yeah.

5408
03:35:06,251 --> 03:35:07,520
It probably needs to be defined.
Yeah.

5409
03:35:07,580 --> 03:35:09,120
I think that that's the first step.
But yeah,

5410
03:35:09,121 --> 03:35:09,954
I mean it's interesting to say love 
isn't the path for them to invest 

5411
03:35:11,870 --> 03:35:12,181
saying,
no,

5412
03:35:12,181 --> 03:35:13,330
not really.
You know,

5413
03:35:13,350 --> 03:35:14,490
it,
it was a beautiful thing.

5414
03:35:14,520 --> 03:35:15,353
It a great construct.
And it costs the Athenians a lot of 

5415
03:35:16,741 --> 03:35:20,170
money and they did it to beautify the 
city and make it the jewel of Greece.

5416
03:35:20,450 --> 03:35:21,840
Um,
but it wasn't like,

5417
03:35:22,560 --> 03:35:25,860
I mean,
what's more impressive is it's more that

5418
03:35:25,861 --> 03:35:29,380
they did for political reasons.
The Parthenon is built on the crop.

5419
03:35:29,760 --> 03:35:32,310
They did it.
The Acropolis is what's a really a trip.

5420
03:35:32,630 --> 03:35:35,850
What it was cause this giant fucking 
chunks of stone.

5421
03:35:35,851 --> 03:35:40,530
They have no idea how big they are open.
They're huge and they're like,

5422
03:35:40,531 --> 03:35:40,770
what?

5423
03:35:40,770 --> 03:35:41,603
They don't even know why they're there,
but they weren't even built at the same 

5424
03:35:43,681 --> 03:35:44,514
time.
The Acropolis is just a natural stone 

5425
03:35:45,901 --> 03:35:46,734
formation.
Not necessarily there's stones under 

5426
03:35:49,051 --> 03:35:50,440
that natural stone,
like the,

5427
03:35:50,810 --> 03:35:51,643
the actual platform that the parthenon 
was built on existed before the 

5428
03:35:54,781 --> 03:35:56,900
Parthenon.
Right.

5429
03:35:56,940 --> 03:35:58,830
I,
I'm not sure I follow what you're saying

5430
03:35:58,831 --> 03:36:00,210
that because as far as I'm aware,
the Acropolis,

5431
03:36:00,211 --> 03:36:01,860
the Acropolis just lost the 
inflammation.

5432
03:36:01,861 --> 03:36:03,600
Then they,
I guess they must have leveled it off as

5433
03:36:03,601 --> 03:36:06,750
something something,
but then there's actual physical stones,

5434
03:36:06,751 --> 03:36:07,584
actual monstrous physical stones that 
are involved in construction molter and 

5435
03:36:11,131 --> 03:36:13,830
see the same sort of pull up photos,
see if he could find that.

5436
03:36:13,890 --> 03:36:14,680
There's a bunch of that.
Yeah.

5437
03:36:14,680 --> 03:36:17,250
The old ones.
And what's the thing in Multa where they

5438
03:36:17,251 --> 03:36:19,080
thought there was like bill by side 
collapses or something?

5439
03:36:19,081 --> 03:36:20,040
Giant.
Giant size,

5440
03:36:20,041 --> 03:36:22,710
like 3000 years BC.
Is that ball back now?

5441
03:36:22,711 --> 03:36:23,810
That's in Lebanon?
Yeah.

5442
03:36:23,811 --> 03:36:25,380
No,
this ball back in Lebanon,

5443
03:36:25,381 --> 03:36:28,500
they found these enormous stone carved 
things.

5444
03:36:28,830 --> 03:36:30,210
Yeah.
See those stones?

5445
03:36:30,480 --> 03:36:32,280
Which ones?
The uh,

5446
03:36:32,281 --> 03:36:32,940
the,
the,

5447
03:36:32,940 --> 03:36:33,990
there's,
there's some stuff.

5448
03:36:34,050 --> 03:36:35,980
See if you could find some images of 
the,

5449
03:36:36,130 --> 03:36:36,970
yeah,
some of it does.

5450
03:36:36,971 --> 03:36:37,900
It does.
From that side.

5451
03:36:38,230 --> 03:36:39,700
I'm pretty sure that just a natural 
stone out.

5452
03:36:39,730 --> 03:36:40,780
I mean the,
on the,

5453
03:36:40,781 --> 03:36:42,550
this sort of like fortifications around 
it,

5454
03:36:42,580 --> 03:36:43,413
you know,
you can probably just google that and 

5455
03:36:43,961 --> 03:36:46,450
find out when we put up it probably like
16th century or something,

5456
03:36:46,960 --> 03:36:47,793
you know,
there's nothing mystical about the path 

5457
03:36:49,411 --> 03:36:50,244
or not.
It's just a really useful defensive 

5458
03:36:51,050 --> 03:36:54,130
fortification or not missed a call.
I'm just saying ancient.

5459
03:36:54,730 --> 03:36:55,451
I think they,
uh,

5460
03:36:55,451 --> 03:36:57,310
the speculation was that the,
uh,

5461
03:36:57,311 --> 03:36:59,230
the Acropolis,
which one's the Acropolis?

5462
03:36:59,270 --> 03:37:01,480
That's bottom.
The Parthenon is the top.

5463
03:37:01,660 --> 03:37:03,280
Now the powerful though is on the 
Acropolis.

5464
03:37:03,670 --> 03:37:06,640
The Parthenon is on the top and the 
Acropolis is on the bottom.

5465
03:37:06,641 --> 03:37:08,150
That's what I'm saying.
That they,

5466
03:37:08,151 --> 03:37:10,660
the,
the thing that they think is the ancient

5467
03:37:10,690 --> 03:37:12,190
stones.
Okay.

5468
03:37:12,330 --> 03:37:13,240
Altogether.
Yeah.

5469
03:37:13,600 --> 03:37:15,400
And the Parthenon is just the building.
Yeah.

5470
03:37:15,490 --> 03:37:16,090
Right.
Okay.

5471
03:37:16,090 --> 03:37:18,640
The papillon was a temple.
And so when you say the Acropolis,

5472
03:37:18,641 --> 03:37:22,000
the Parthenon is the,
most cities have necropolis,

5473
03:37:22,001 --> 03:37:25,470
which is just a raised rocky bit that 
they'd build defensive right then.

5474
03:37:25,480 --> 03:37:26,313
But you know,
they'd put the temple's on and stuff 

5475
03:37:27,461 --> 03:37:28,151
like,
so find out what,

5476
03:37:28,151 --> 03:37:29,320
where,
where I read that,

5477
03:37:29,350 --> 03:37:33,550
see if you could google a man made 
stones in the Acropolis.

5478
03:37:34,570 --> 03:37:35,403
There was some sort of weird speculation
that the Acropolis was a part of some 

5479
03:37:38,231 --> 03:37:40,750
structure that was far older than the 
Parthenon.

5480
03:37:42,810 --> 03:37:43,740
Not,
uh,

5481
03:37:44,090 --> 03:37:45,780
not,
not persuaded by all of that sort of,

5482
03:37:45,790 --> 03:37:48,440
that was a bit fringe stuff for me.
You're not in the friendship.

5483
03:37:49,100 --> 03:37:52,870
Not when it comes to history.
I like to know accurate stuff,

5484
03:37:52,871 --> 03:37:53,740
you know?
Yeah.

5485
03:37:53,770 --> 03:37:54,940
No,
it makes sense.

5486
03:37:54,970 --> 03:37:57,220
It's just fringe is always more 
attractive though.

5487
03:37:57,250 --> 03:37:58,150
It's interesting,
isn't it?

5488
03:37:58,600 --> 03:38:00,040
Because you never know and there's the 
like,

5489
03:38:00,041 --> 03:38:00,874
oh,
you might be able to find out for 

5490
03:38:01,571 --> 03:38:02,404
yourself,
but it's also like undeniably it has 

5491
03:38:04,241 --> 03:38:05,320
gravity.
Yeah.

5492
03:38:05,350 --> 03:38:06,700
Towards me.
At least I am.

5493
03:38:06,701 --> 03:38:08,380
I love the old stuff.
They're like,

5494
03:38:08,381 --> 03:38:08,621
no,
no,

5495
03:38:08,621 --> 03:38:09,790
no.
You know what they found out,

5496
03:38:09,791 --> 03:38:10,700
man,
they were werewolves.

5497
03:38:10,780 --> 03:38:11,613
You know,
there's always like something that you 

5498
03:38:12,221 --> 03:38:13,054
find out.
Yeah.

5499
03:38:13,110 --> 03:38:16,540
I went through all of this and my 
twenties I went through literally all of

5500
03:38:16,541 --> 03:38:17,680
these fucking,
I'm a late bloomer.

5501
03:38:17,980 --> 03:38:18,813
They really,
all right.

5502
03:38:19,470 --> 03:38:20,830
You'll end up eventually where I am.

5503
03:38:21,040 --> 03:38:21,873
Oh,
I definitely want wake end up where you 

5504
03:38:22,481 --> 03:38:23,250
are.
You will,

5505
03:38:23,250 --> 03:38:24,490
you know,
it's,

5506
03:38:24,560 --> 03:38:26,380
it's a good place to be.
It's um,

5507
03:38:26,470 --> 03:38:30,850
you go through all of these ferries and 
you'll immediately dismiss things.

5508
03:38:30,910 --> 03:38:32,320
No,
you don't immediately dismiss things.

5509
03:38:32,321 --> 03:38:34,240
Then you have to start reading about why
things happened.

5510
03:38:34,960 --> 03:38:36,830
That's the thing.
You have to start reading the,

5511
03:38:36,831 --> 03:38:39,060
the source material.
That's why I know who built the bill,

5512
03:38:39,070 --> 03:38:39,903
the Parthenon.
Right.

5513
03:38:40,060 --> 03:38:40,893
But that's also why you just just 
flippantly decided that [inaudible] was 

5514
03:38:44,441 --> 03:38:45,160
small.
Yeah.

5515
03:38:45,160 --> 03:38:45,470
Well,
no,

5516
03:38:45,470 --> 03:38:46,660
no,
it's not that the size of,

5517
03:38:46,661 --> 03:38:47,494
it's irrelevant.
It's the sort of technological 

5518
03:38:48,731 --> 03:38:49,600
advancement,
you know,

5519
03:38:49,601 --> 03:38:51,700
it doesn't take much to Co coff stone.
They used to,

5520
03:38:51,701 --> 03:38:52,534
you know,
let you know they just other stone to 

5521
03:38:53,771 --> 03:38:55,900
break against it and then it's smooth at
the hands of sand.

5522
03:38:55,901 --> 03:38:56,734
You know,
it just took a lot of work for a long 

5523
03:38:57,971 --> 03:39:00,680
time and I mean wrong,
it must've been fucking with,

5524
03:39:00,710 --> 03:39:02,740
you know,
get a hide the leather put sand in it.

5525
03:39:02,760 --> 03:39:05,410
He spent ages smoothing up stone.
Do it yourself if you'd like.

5526
03:39:05,411 --> 03:39:06,880
It's fucking boring,
you know?

5527
03:39:06,881 --> 03:39:07,714
But I guess if you've got nothing else 
to do all day because you're just right 

5528
03:39:09,821 --> 03:39:10,280
here,
Jamie,

5529
03:39:10,280 --> 03:39:11,740
but that's not carved,
that's like,

5530
03:39:11,741 --> 03:39:16,010
uh,
this is bass relief I believe is it says

5531
03:39:16,030 --> 03:39:16,863
what most of the art,
and we'll go back with tippy was it was 

5532
03:39:18,911 --> 03:39:19,480
like,
ah,

5533
03:39:19,480 --> 03:39:20,313
yeah,
it's a three d and moved away and not 

5534
03:39:21,791 --> 03:39:23,350
carved into,
yeah,

5535
03:39:23,351 --> 03:39:25,570
that's what was interesting about.
It's more difficult.

5536
03:39:25,780 --> 03:39:26,560
Yeah.
It doesn't really,

5537
03:39:26,560 --> 03:39:27,393
I mean,
I don't want to take anything away from 

5538
03:39:27,941 --> 03:39:30,070
the artist because that must've been a 
lot of work.

5539
03:39:30,310 --> 03:39:33,160
What was the a man made stones and the 
Acropolis to finding

5540
03:39:34,040 --> 03:39:38,300
there was evidence of these enormous 
chunks of rock that were moved.

5541
03:39:38,780 --> 03:39:39,613
Maybe I might be conflating chunks of 
rock a ball back in Lebanon with the 

5542
03:39:44,001 --> 03:39:44,834
Acropolis.
It's all fascinating to me because we 

5543
03:39:47,391 --> 03:39:48,224
don't know.
We just don't know what these people 

5544
03:39:49,551 --> 03:39:50,384
were up to and we see what they left 
behind and we pieced it together and 

5545
03:39:53,151 --> 03:39:55,760
people have studied it for thousands of 
years and it's just,

5546
03:39:55,761 --> 03:39:57,200
it's amazing.
Just,

5547
03:39:57,230 --> 03:39:59,120
I mean,
I'm sure you've been to Rome,

5548
03:39:59,150 --> 03:40:00,620
right?
You haven't,

5549
03:40:00,740 --> 03:40:02,450
it's on my list to me,
man.

5550
03:40:02,910 --> 03:40:04,910
The coliseums fairly recent,
right?

5551
03:40:06,140 --> 03:40:08,990
One of the century ideal something.
Yeah.

5552
03:40:09,050 --> 03:40:11,710
I mean in terms of like ancient 
civilization,

5553
03:40:11,720 --> 03:40:13,300
the very recent,
but it's,

5554
03:40:13,330 --> 03:40:15,800
it's so crazy when they show you the 
history of it.

5555
03:40:16,040 --> 03:40:19,940
How they used to that whole thing was 
like Nero's backyard.

5556
03:40:20,810 --> 03:40:23,750
I mean that's really what,
and then they decided to,

5557
03:40:23,751 --> 03:40:24,920
once they,
it's a bad,

5558
03:40:24,980 --> 03:40:27,260
yeah.
Well then then decided to build this,

5559
03:40:27,261 --> 03:40:31,130
this thing to sort of entertain the 
masses.

5560
03:40:31,400 --> 03:40:34,010
And this thing has gone through all 
these different,

5561
03:40:34,011 --> 03:40:36,350
various stages.
And when they show you all the different

5562
03:40:36,351 --> 03:40:37,610
things they used to do,
they're like,

5563
03:40:37,790 --> 03:40:38,623
have these boat fights where they would 
fill it up with water and they would 

5564
03:40:41,691 --> 03:40:42,524
raise these lions and all these animals 
through the bottom of the cage and they 

5565
03:40:44,601 --> 03:40:46,640
would fight against him.
Like you're fucking crazy.

5566
03:40:46,641 --> 03:40:47,630
And not that long ago.

5567
03:40:49,700 --> 03:40:50,780
Yeah.
I mean like,

5568
03:40:51,270 --> 03:40:53,150
people used to be brutal.
Let's think people forget.

5569
03:40:53,151 --> 03:40:53,811
It's like,
well,

5570
03:40:53,811 --> 03:40:55,370
we were talking about Isis.
They still are.

5571
03:40:55,430 --> 03:40:56,151
Yeah,
well they,

5572
03:40:56,151 --> 03:40:57,080
uh,
but now,

5573
03:40:57,110 --> 03:41:00,710
I mean not that shocks and his whole 
unit to most people,

5574
03:41:00,711 --> 03:41:01,640
but like,
I mean,

5575
03:41:01,641 --> 03:41:03,080
like in,
in the 15th century,

5576
03:41:03,081 --> 03:41:05,330
16th century kids used to do coke 
fighting.

5577
03:41:05,331 --> 03:41:06,050
You know,
they,

5578
03:41:06,050 --> 03:41:08,420
they do it here in Mexican and Mexican 
neighborhoods.

5579
03:41:08,720 --> 03:41:09,553
Yeah.
I can just watching these chickens 

5580
03:41:10,530 --> 03:41:14,390
killing one of my old dumb,
this guy that he's to use as a gardener,

5581
03:41:14,690 --> 03:41:16,250
like six,
seven years ago,

5582
03:41:16,500 --> 03:41:18,730
he used to cockfight no,
no something,

5583
03:41:18,731 --> 03:41:20,360
no compassion for anything that wasn't 
human.

5584
03:41:20,361 --> 03:41:21,051
Basically.
It was like,

5585
03:41:21,051 --> 03:41:22,940
oh,
definitely not for chickens.

5586
03:41:22,960 --> 03:41:24,530
Yeah.
They put razor blades on them.

5587
03:41:24,531 --> 03:41:26,480
Live with spurs on them.
They fight each other.

5588
03:41:26,630 --> 03:41:27,710
Yeah.
It's fucking crazy.

5589
03:41:28,220 --> 03:41:29,053
Yeah.
They,

5590
03:41:29,100 --> 03:41:29,933
I went to this guys,
you already had like a hundred a 

5591
03:41:31,550 --> 03:41:32,383
roosters in these like pens and they 
would have this carved out area and a 

5592
03:41:35,691 --> 03:41:37,190
pit it let the roosters go.

5593
03:41:37,790 --> 03:41:38,623
It's super common.
It's super common in many parts of the 

5594
03:41:40,551 --> 03:41:41,271
world.
In fact,

5595
03:41:41,271 --> 03:41:43,340
it's really common in the south of 
America,

5596
03:41:43,850 --> 03:41:46,100
not South America,
but south of the United States.

5597
03:41:46,610 --> 03:41:48,140
It's a,
it's real common,

5598
03:41:48,141 --> 03:41:51,530
like cockfights sort of not thought of 
the same way.

5599
03:41:51,531 --> 03:41:53,270
It's like dog fights,
like dog fights.

5600
03:41:53,660 --> 03:41:54,880
Horrify people.
Yeah,

5601
03:41:55,160 --> 03:41:56,990
but chicken fights.
People like,

5602
03:41:57,200 --> 03:42:00,440
Hey,
he's cutting the dog.

5603
03:42:01,010 --> 03:42:01,641
Well,
it's still,

5604
03:42:01,641 --> 03:42:05,020
they still do bull fights in Spain.
Should I do all the amazing,

5605
03:42:05,060 --> 03:42:05,893
it's pretty controversial these days.
They just lost another matador a couple 

5606
03:42:08,960 --> 03:42:09,541
of days ago.
He got fucked.

5607
03:42:09,541 --> 03:42:11,570
Doug.
I stepped over his own cape.

5608
03:42:11,870 --> 03:42:13,970
Tripped over the Cape.
Got Jacked.

5609
03:42:14,000 --> 03:42:14,391
Yeah.
Yeah.

5610
03:42:14,391 --> 03:42:16,340
He'd get torn apart.
No sympathy whatsoever.

5611
03:42:16,880 --> 03:42:17,780
No,
no.

5612
03:42:17,781 --> 03:42:21,840
It's a foolish way to do.
You wanted it to die and risk your life.

5613
03:42:22,130 --> 03:42:27,130
The whole thing is crazy ex.
But Spain is an advanced civilization.

5614
03:42:28,060 --> 03:42:31,830
Well,
I've known too many Spaniards.

5615
03:42:31,980 --> 03:42:33,240
Ah,
how dare you.

5616
03:42:34,250 --> 03:42:35,083
But didn't anything that I think in 
general there are modern Western 

5617
03:42:37,321 --> 03:42:39,160
civilization and they have bull 
fighting.

5618
03:42:39,780 --> 03:42:40,920
Do you know what's really funny about 
spine?

5619
03:42:40,930 --> 03:42:42,270
Explain that.
Cause I mean like a,

5620
03:42:42,271 --> 03:42:44,310
in America you've got a terrible 
history,

5621
03:42:44,460 --> 03:42:45,293
right?
We have a terrible history of being 

5622
03:42:46,741 --> 03:42:47,940
terrible is what you're saying.
Yeah,

5623
03:42:48,210 --> 03:42:49,043
yeah,
yeah.

5624
03:42:49,230 --> 03:42:50,760
Okay.
So the Spanish,

5625
03:42:50,850 --> 03:42:52,140
Spanish,
Spanish history is,

5626
03:42:52,141 --> 03:42:56,730
I'm highly Islamophobic obviously.
And I went out and spent a few years ago

5627
03:42:57,090 --> 03:42:59,640
and um,
everything everywhere.

5628
03:42:59,820 --> 03:43:02,940
It's a white guy killing him,
Muslim on every poultry,

5629
03:43:02,970 --> 03:43:04,860
on every undergo.
Oh yeah.

5630
03:43:05,270 --> 03:43:08,730
Cause they spent 800 years kicking the 
Muslims out of Spain because the Muslims

5631
03:43:08,731 --> 03:43:09,564
came along and conquered Spain.
And so everything is Towsley 

5632
03:43:13,440 --> 03:43:14,610
Islamophobic because that is their 
history.

5633
03:43:14,611 --> 03:43:15,444
They can't get away from it that they 
wouldn't be a Spain because the malls 

5634
03:43:17,611 --> 03:43:18,960
came over and conquered it and they were
like,

5635
03:43:18,961 --> 03:43:19,794
right,
everyone's a Muslim now or you're going 

5636
03:43:20,341 --> 03:43:21,260
to have to pay the Gza.

5637
03:43:21,470 --> 03:43:23,190
Ah,
you're going to be a DHIMMI.

5638
03:43:23,460 --> 03:43:24,560
And they were like,
no.

5639
03:43:24,561 --> 03:43:26,340
And they spent emgs,
his letter,

5640
03:43:27,060 --> 03:43:27,631
whatever,
loss,

5641
03:43:27,631 --> 03:43:29,700
resistance or whatever,
they're the Spanish.

5642
03:43:29,701 --> 03:43:30,930
Before it would be like,
you know,

5643
03:43:30,931 --> 03:43:34,620
just the reconquista and it took several
crusades.

5644
03:43:34,621 --> 03:43:37,500
It took hundreds of years and gallons of
blood.

5645
03:43:37,800 --> 03:43:39,830
But eventually Spain became Christine 
again and the,

5646
03:43:39,870 --> 03:43:42,420
and the Muslims and they're like the,
the Islam of files.

5647
03:43:42,421 --> 03:43:44,430
He'll sit there and go,
oh well you know,

5648
03:43:44,460 --> 03:43:47,580
I'll under loose.
Yeah it was stolen from someone else and

5649
03:43:47,581 --> 03:43:48,414
these people took it back.
I've got no fucking sympathy for these 

5650
03:43:50,701 --> 03:43:51,630
people.
Got kicked out.

5651
03:43:51,780 --> 03:43:53,790
Who came in originally?
I wasn't even supposed to be there.

5652
03:43:54,100 --> 03:43:54,933
And I'll tell you what,
the Muslims are fucking lucky that 

5653
03:43:56,401 --> 03:43:57,234
Columbus discovered the new world 
because the Spanish were basically 

5654
03:43:58,331 --> 03:44:00,970
functional roll up all of North Africa.
That was gonna.

5655
03:44:00,990 --> 03:44:04,530
They were piling to take it all fucking 
back cause this was all Christian.

5656
03:44:05,010 --> 03:44:06,550
It really annoys me that people are 
like,

5657
03:44:06,551 --> 03:44:08,130
oh no that's Muslim.
No it wasn't.

5658
03:44:08,490 --> 03:44:11,790
And it's because they took it and so if 
the Spanish is going to take it back,

5659
03:44:12,120 --> 03:44:12,953
that's just as valid.
You don't have an argument against them 

5660
03:44:14,611 --> 03:44:17,100
doing it and it's something that's been 
established though.

5661
03:44:17,101 --> 03:44:19,150
We don't want you to take it back to 
know,

5662
03:44:20,080 --> 03:44:21,060
Oh yeah,
I'm not just saying it now.

5663
03:44:21,120 --> 03:44:24,120
I'll be suggesting it,
but it's still,

5664
03:44:24,190 --> 03:44:25,380
yeah,
it does.

5665
03:44:25,381 --> 03:44:26,550
I put like,
you know when we're,

5666
03:44:26,551 --> 03:44:27,384
when we're looking back at history 
through the lens of having a moral 

5667
03:44:29,221 --> 03:44:31,150
judgment about it and they go,
oh,

5668
03:44:31,220 --> 03:44:33,900
the Spanish kicked the Muslims.
I've Spain.

5669
03:44:34,320 --> 03:44:36,150
Yeah,
good for them.

5670
03:44:36,950 --> 03:44:37,783
They have every right to,
he can't really have moral judgments 

5671
03:44:40,171 --> 03:44:41,760
about history when people do this full 
time.

5672
03:44:41,910 --> 03:44:44,480
I mean like the Crusades,
Jimmy Dale,

5673
03:44:44,490 --> 03:44:45,640
this,
there's nothing less than the crew said,

5674
03:44:45,641 --> 03:44:47,340
shut the fuck up Jimmy.

5675
03:44:47,760 --> 03:44:49,260
You do not know what you're talking 
about.

5676
03:44:49,261 --> 03:44:51,360
Just shutup cenk stopped talking at the 
Crusades.

5677
03:44:51,930 --> 03:44:53,130
Oh,
unless I tell you what,

5678
03:44:53,131 --> 03:44:54,510
you're right.
Let's call them back.

5679
03:44:54,720 --> 03:44:55,553
Bring back the crusading armies.
It's called a Baldwin Baldwin of 

5680
03:44:57,721 --> 03:44:58,471
Jerusalem.
Come on.

5681
03:44:58,471 --> 03:45:00,390
You're going to have to come home.
He'd come on Baldwin.

5682
03:45:00,391 --> 03:45:01,640
This is wrong.
We shouldn't be crusading.

5683
03:45:01,680 --> 03:45:05,340
Oh well that ended 800 years ago,
but done conversation over.

5684
03:45:05,580 --> 03:45:06,900
I pisses me off,
man.

5685
03:45:07,140 --> 03:45:09,570
They keep bringing up the shit.
Absolute Shit.

5686
03:45:09,571 --> 03:45:11,520
But what about the Crusades?
What about the fucking crusades?

5687
03:45:11,820 --> 03:45:14,910
Where are the crusaders Jank you know,
where are the fucking crusaders?

5688
03:45:14,940 --> 03:45:17,250
Are you talking to Janky Yogurt,
Jimmy?

5689
03:45:18,500 --> 03:45:20,040
Any here?
You're talking about Yo?

5690
03:45:20,090 --> 03:45:20,760
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

5691
03:45:20,760 --> 03:45:22,050
Yeah.
Some people do,

5692
03:45:22,051 --> 03:45:23,670
but most people don't.
Fucking nose.

5693
03:45:23,671 --> 03:45:25,760
I saw him at vidcon.
I'm sure he knows there's,

5694
03:45:25,780 --> 03:45:27,390
you're talking about and when you say 
his name,

5695
03:45:27,391 --> 03:45:28,224
but I'm saying you're saying it too,
a large audience that people know just 

5696
03:45:31,871 --> 03:45:32,900
because you don't know peanut.

5697
03:45:32,900 --> 03:45:34,180
Oh,
a lot of people don't,

5698
03:45:34,420 --> 03:45:35,253
but I do keep though.
I do know other people don't find for 

5699
03:45:37,300 --> 03:45:38,133
people.
How do we get out of bullfighting to 

5700
03:45:39,551 --> 03:45:43,150
this cultural relativism?
Basically?

5701
03:45:43,151 --> 03:45:45,370
I think it was what it is and what we're
talking about.

5702
03:45:45,490 --> 03:45:47,760
Advanced civilizations.
He's sick of the apologists.

5703
03:45:48,010 --> 03:45:50,590
It's like look like look,
things that happened in the past,

5704
03:45:50,591 --> 03:45:52,660
we didn't have to apologize for,
you know,

5705
03:45:52,950 --> 03:45:55,740
these things just happened.
We don't need to do things.

5706
03:45:56,250 --> 03:45:59,500
Why people should apologize for all the,
all the horrible things that we've done.

5707
03:45:59,740 --> 03:46:02,080
What about to native Americans?
Should we apologize to them?

5708
03:46:02,230 --> 03:46:03,063
I think that if they're prepared to 
apologize to the people they genocide 

5709
03:46:05,271 --> 03:46:06,850
it.
Wow,

5710
03:46:06,860 --> 03:46:07,900
that's,
you're going a little too far.

5711
03:46:07,901 --> 03:46:09,010
But that doesn't exist anymore.
No,

5712
03:46:09,100 --> 03:46:10,840
you go too far back.
That's a problem.

5713
03:46:10,970 --> 03:46:14,260
Well,
who decided once we have done that,

5714
03:46:14,261 --> 03:46:15,460
we've trespassed on their land.

5715
03:46:15,460 --> 03:46:20,460
You don't bring up them doing it cause 
that hour that would be native American.

5716
03:46:20,561 --> 03:46:22,300
A phobic.
It's not our place.

5717
03:46:23,010 --> 03:46:23,710
Our place.
Yeah.

5718
03:46:23,710 --> 03:46:25,100
See this the whole thing.
It's all bollocks.

5719
03:46:25,110 --> 03:46:28,090
And this whole relativism is pissing me 
off and he read it really actually makes

5720
03:46:28,091 --> 03:46:28,924
me angry and none of them will ever 
listen to the like the counter 

5721
03:46:31,131 --> 03:46:32,260
arguments.
It's really annoying.

5722
03:46:32,820 --> 03:46:33,560
And so it's just like,
no.

5723
03:46:33,560 --> 03:46:34,270
Like,
you know,

5724
03:46:34,270 --> 03:46:35,103
nobody's got any respect for you when 
you turn around and say portable 

5725
03:46:36,550 --> 03:46:37,680
crusades.
That's the,

5726
03:46:38,050 --> 03:46:38,883
I mean,
what a boundary is the dumbest damn 

5727
03:46:39,731 --> 03:46:41,250
thing anyway because you never 
addressing the point.

5728
03:46:41,251 --> 03:46:41,571
It's like,
yeah,

5729
03:46:41,571 --> 03:46:46,571
but he didn't even give a context about 
Islam basically.

5730
03:46:48,060 --> 03:46:49,090
You know,
there's,

5731
03:46:49,150 --> 03:46:49,750
you know,
they,

5732
03:46:49,750 --> 03:46:50,583
they,
they for some reason to think that 

5733
03:46:50,951 --> 03:46:52,620
Christianity is as bad as Islam as a 
nurse,

5734
03:46:52,660 --> 03:46:55,270
not,
I mean like the Crusades were distinctly

5735
03:46:55,300 --> 03:46:57,190
and,
and I spoke to his story and Tom Holland

5736
03:46:57,191 --> 03:46:59,080
about this and I was like,
look,

5737
03:46:59,380 --> 03:47:02,620
how did they come to the conclusion that
they shouldn't have a crusade?

5738
03:47:03,010 --> 03:47:03,843
And he was like,
well they didn't get it from 

5739
03:47:04,361 --> 03:47:07,390
Christianity and the Orthodox,
uh,

5740
03:47:07,420 --> 03:47:08,253
the Orthodox patriarch in Constantinople
was just completely against the idea 

5741
03:47:11,381 --> 03:47:14,470
because there's nothing in the Bible 
that justifies it in the new testament.

5742
03:47:14,730 --> 03:47:15,563
You know,
Jason,

5743
03:47:15,680 --> 03:47:17,500
man of peace,
he turns her on the cheek,

5744
03:47:17,680 --> 03:47:20,770
he lets his enemies strike him.
So you can't pick up a sword and say I'm

5745
03:47:20,771 --> 03:47:21,604
going to kill someone for Jesus.
It doesn't make sense when people have 

5746
03:47:25,241 --> 03:47:26,690
massive amounts of power.
And then,

5747
03:47:26,740 --> 03:47:27,350
I mean,
it went,

5748
03:47:27,350 --> 03:47:29,980
it's weird with the Aztecs,
it goes weird with everybody.

5749
03:47:30,310 --> 03:47:31,930
It was entirely Tempura.
It was about like,

5750
03:47:31,931 --> 03:47:32,950
you know,
concrete and Middle East.

5751
03:47:33,130 --> 03:47:33,963
But it was also about like making sure 
that they could get to Jerusalem is 

5752
03:47:35,720 --> 03:47:37,060
like,
like an ideological thing.

5753
03:47:37,061 --> 03:47:37,894
Cause the,
the Turks were basically preventing 

5754
03:47:38,830 --> 03:47:39,663
pilgrims from getting to Jerusalem 
because Muslims don't Jerusalem's for 

5755
03:47:41,791 --> 03:47:42,624
like 400 years and everything was okay 
because the pilgrims could travel along 

5756
03:47:46,181 --> 03:47:48,490
a pill and trail and you know,
people make money doing this,

5757
03:47:48,491 --> 03:47:49,420
you know,
they'd sell things.

5758
03:47:49,840 --> 03:47:51,160
And then the text came in and were like,
hey,

5759
03:47:51,161 --> 03:47:54,550
we're Muslims and fuck everyone cause 
with the Turks and that was it.

5760
03:47:54,580 --> 03:47:57,100
The pilgrims couldn't go to Jerusalem 
and they'd put the pope,

5761
03:47:57,101 --> 03:47:58,000
I think it was,
it was an innocent,

5762
03:47:58,001 --> 03:47:58,900
the second urban,
the second,

5763
03:47:58,901 --> 03:47:59,734
I can never remember which one it was,
which of the pope was he tell him I 

5764
03:48:02,051 --> 03:48:02,884
said,
hey,

5765
03:48:03,400 --> 03:48:05,830
I could create a spiritual kingdom or 
empire,

5766
03:48:06,310 --> 03:48:09,850
an empire of faith on.
And he's like,

5767
03:48:09,851 --> 03:48:12,160
why don't you all rather than fighting 
each other in Europe,

5768
03:48:12,220 --> 03:48:16,120
I mean Europeans were not very advanced,
but they were very,

5769
03:48:16,121 --> 03:48:19,780
very warlike and wanting to get to the 
Middle East.

5770
03:48:19,810 --> 03:48:22,000
And they did.
And the crusade was actually,

5771
03:48:22,390 --> 03:48:24,370
it means a real thrilling thing to read 
about.

5772
03:48:24,371 --> 03:48:25,001
Now what,
you know,

5773
03:48:25,001 --> 03:48:27,980
you see like historical films like all 
the time,

5774
03:48:27,981 --> 03:48:31,790
it's always the Roman empire.
Which one?

5775
03:48:32,060 --> 03:48:33,890
Just every historical fucking right.

5776
03:48:34,060 --> 03:48:36,620
Okay.
And it's just someone needs to do a film

5777
03:48:36,621 --> 03:48:37,454
by the first crusade.
Cause the first crusade is one of the 

5778
03:48:38,361 --> 03:48:40,400
most thrilling things you can ever read 
about.

5779
03:48:40,700 --> 03:48:43,490
It's just the most,
it's insane what these men did,

5780
03:48:43,730 --> 03:48:44,391
you know,
marching.

5781
03:48:44,391 --> 03:48:47,930
I mean they must like a thousand miles 
from northern Europe and just the master

5782
03:48:47,931 --> 03:48:50,270
and just,
it's so much stuff.

5783
03:48:50,660 --> 03:48:51,493
Like the pope first calls a crusade and 
it goes kind of wrong for him cause 

5784
03:48:54,891 --> 03:48:58,940
everyone's like the page or the emperor 
in Constantinople,

5785
03:48:58,941 --> 03:49:01,130
the [inaudible],
he says the,

5786
03:49:01,131 --> 03:49:01,790
uh,
the pope,

5787
03:49:01,790 --> 03:49:03,050
look,
do me a favor.

5788
03:49:03,051 --> 03:49:05,570
I'm getting thrashed by the Turks.
I need about 4,000

5789
03:49:05,571 --> 03:49:09,620
nights professional soldiers,
good fighters so I can beat them back.

5790
03:49:09,830 --> 03:49:10,641
And the posts like,
hey,

5791
03:49:10,641 --> 03:49:11,474
great idea.
Why don't we all go over there and beat 

5792
03:49:12,981 --> 03:49:17,280
up the Tux for Christianity and loads of
patents when I call.

5793
03:49:17,281 --> 03:49:18,114
And that's a good idea.

5794
03:49:18,380 --> 03:49:21,320
And so like 70,000
peasants led by Peter,

5795
03:49:21,321 --> 03:49:23,690
the hermit turn up on the,
the emperor is dose and he's like,

5796
03:49:23,691 --> 03:49:25,610
what the fuck is this?
You know,

5797
03:49:25,611 --> 03:49:28,820
why have you sent me the scum of Europe 
to come and fight the Turks?

5798
03:49:28,970 --> 03:49:29,803
So he just gets them across into 
Anatolia and they go on and they just 

5799
03:49:31,281 --> 03:49:33,830
get massacred by the text.
Absolutely butchered.

5800
03:49:34,430 --> 03:49:38,010
And then the crusading armies actually 
arrive a piece.

5801
03:49:38,020 --> 03:49:40,490
The home actually manages to survive,
but then the Crusades,

5802
03:49:40,491 --> 03:49:43,070
the army's arrive and the Turks think,
well this would be fine.

5803
03:49:43,071 --> 03:49:44,450
And the emperor is like,
Shit,

5804
03:49:44,451 --> 03:49:45,284
look at all these really.
And these guys were totally 

5805
03:49:46,641 --> 03:49:47,474
disrespectful.
It gets them across and they ended up 

5806
03:49:49,881 --> 03:49:50,714
smashing the texts and the Turks were 
just expecting another bunch of passes 

5807
03:49:52,430 --> 03:49:54,320
and they're not expecting what they 
called the men of iron,

5808
03:49:54,680 --> 03:49:58,160
which couldn't be broken.
And that's why they both fight in Paris,

5809
03:49:58,660 --> 03:50:00,460
Spain,
we fucked out.

5810
03:50:00,500 --> 03:50:01,041
But it's,
it's,

5811
03:50:01,041 --> 03:50:01,581
you know,
this,

5812
03:50:01,581 --> 03:50:03,920
this is a really interesting thing and 
no one ever talks about it,

5813
03:50:04,310 --> 03:50:05,143
but it's the history of human beings as 
fast as we have learned and how long 

5814
03:50:09,231 --> 03:50:11,730
it's taken us to get to this point.
The regressive left,

5815
03:50:11,731 --> 03:50:13,970
they'll always talk to you like this is 
like a one sided.

5816
03:50:14,030 --> 03:50:15,180
Oh,
the Kristine's side.

5817
03:50:15,190 --> 03:50:16,830
Just bullying them out of the blue one 
day.

5818
03:50:16,831 --> 03:50:17,241
It's like,
no.

5819
03:50:17,241 --> 03:50:19,190
There was an established order.
There were things going on.

5820
03:50:19,191 --> 03:50:21,920
Those is really detailed political 
landscape,

5821
03:50:22,130 --> 03:50:23,300
and you'll get someone to Jimmy Dore 
Goes,

5822
03:50:23,301 --> 03:50:24,740
wow,
there's nothing worth increase age.

5823
03:50:24,760 --> 03:50:25,593
Just shut up.
Just you don't know you're talking 

5824
03:50:27,801 --> 03:50:29,090
about.
Just be quiet.

5825
03:50:29,550 --> 03:50:32,100
All right fella.
I'm glad you got that African angry.

5826
03:50:32,180 --> 03:50:34,340
I've had that on my capital a long time.
Listen,

5827
03:50:34,400 --> 03:50:36,620
we did an extra hour pass the idea.
Oh,

5828
03:50:36,621 --> 03:50:37,640
I could do,
it's two now.

5829
03:50:37,730 --> 03:50:40,010
This is when your flight,
so let's get you another flight.

5830
03:50:40,040 --> 03:50:41,070
Yeah.
And uh,

5831
03:50:41,120 --> 03:50:41,953
thank you brother.
I really appreciate you coming on and 

5832
03:50:42,770 --> 03:50:43,850
thanks to have,
it was very fun.

5833
03:50:43,970 --> 03:50:44,840
It was,
it's fine.

5834
03:50:45,080 --> 03:50:45,913
It's nice that I can a bit some people 
out who need to be bitched out and they 

5835
03:50:48,811 --> 03:50:51,170
see that there's a,
if we get that.

5836
03:50:51,200 --> 03:50:52,160
All right folks,
thank you.

5837
03:50:52,161 --> 03:50:54,000
So back tomorrow with crystal,
AEA,

5838
03:50:54,130 --> 03:50:54,963
cea.
