1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:03,060
Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:04,660
It is what it was.

3
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:07,990
Just like any other problem
that people go back to.

4
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:13,050
I mean at some point it's up to you to
release yourself from that obligation to

5
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:18,520
get upset or feel bad about something
that didn't go right in the past,

6
00:00:18,521 --> 00:00:18,971
you know?

7
00:00:18,971 --> 00:00:19,410
And uh,

8
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:23,130
that's a huge point because people
define themselves by the past instead of

9
00:00:23,131 --> 00:00:27,450
thinking about who they are now instead
of they still look back at a mistake

10
00:00:27,451 --> 00:00:29,490
they made and don't just
get past that mistake,

11
00:00:29,491 --> 00:00:30,390
grow and learn,

12
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:31,470
but dwell on it.

13
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:32,670
I think it defines them.

14
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:33,970
That's the worst thing.

15
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:36,040
I met some guys that band and he says,

16
00:00:36,041 --> 00:00:36,874
is it singers?

17
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:38,200
I've only met him twice,

18
00:00:38,201 --> 00:00:39,010
two different times,

19
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:39,850
years later.

20
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:40,721
Both Times.

21
00:00:40,721 --> 00:00:42,190
He started telling me about the story,

22
00:00:42,191 --> 00:00:43,960
about what happened to
him when he was in this.

23
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:49,290
Anything in this poor guy is gone on all
these years and he's still focused on

24
00:00:49,751 --> 00:00:52,230
the worst situation that he
ever had to live through.

25
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:52,701
Yeah.

26
00:00:52,701 --> 00:00:55,280
And so a attached to it,

27
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,350
well some guys get one
break up and they're done.

28
00:00:57,590 --> 00:00:58,161
Some guys,

29
00:00:58,161 --> 00:01:01,190
one breakup in their twenties
will tank them for a decade.

30
00:01:01,191 --> 00:01:02,810
I've met guys like that that,

31
00:01:02,811 --> 00:01:03,191
yeah.

32
00:01:03,191 --> 00:01:03,541
You know,

33
00:01:03,541 --> 00:01:05,240
I came out here with Shelly and you know,

34
00:01:05,241 --> 00:01:08,090
she fuckin fell in love
with their trainer and dude,

35
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:10,010
Sally still move on.

36
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:11,031
What is that?

37
00:01:11,031 --> 00:01:12,050
And fucking years ago,

38
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:12,980
oh well,

39
00:01:12,981 --> 00:01:13,281
you know,

40
00:01:13,281 --> 00:01:14,330
change my life bro.

41
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,060
But to tell you I was so disappointed
I can't trust women anymore.

42
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:17,870
Oh,

43
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:18,411
you stupid.

44
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:19,070
Fuck.

45
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:19,581
You know what?

46
00:01:19,581 --> 00:01:22,370
What if he got mugged by one
person who'd done trust in people?

47
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:25,400
If you get exactly one
person was a murderer,

48
00:01:25,401 --> 00:01:26,300
let's not trust anybody.

49
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:26,460
Yeah,

50
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:26,910
yeah.

51
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:27,680
You know,

52
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,730
I heard about Ted Bundy.

53
00:01:28,731 --> 00:01:29,840
I'm not trusting people anymore.

54
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:30,201
Oh,

55
00:01:30,201 --> 00:01:30,650
okay,

56
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:30,971
great.

57
00:01:30,971 --> 00:01:31,940
I'm not sleeping tonight.

58
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,273
We,

59
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:34,790
yeah,

60
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:37,040
I mean there's definitely
pitfalls in life.

61
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:37,903
You're going to run into him.

62
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:38,743
We all are.

63
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:39,860
You can learn and grow.

64
00:01:39,861 --> 00:01:40,730
If you survive it,

65
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:41,600
pick yourself up,

66
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:41,771
it,

67
00:01:41,771 --> 00:01:42,830
dust the dust off,

68
00:01:42,831 --> 00:01:43,880
and then you start going,

69
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,230
don't let this stuff.

70
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:46,180
Well,

71
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:47,050
let it beat you down.

72
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:50,680
It's also directly proportionate to the
amount of hardships that people face in

73
00:01:50,681 --> 00:01:51,100
life.

74
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:52,570
Their ability to face hardships.

75
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,111
You know?

76
00:01:53,111 --> 00:01:56,200
And there's a lot of folks that live
life on a cushy cloud of marshmallows and

77
00:01:56,201 --> 00:02:00,310
bullshit and then one day something goes
wrong and I mean that's why s spoiled

78
00:02:00,311 --> 00:02:01,780
kids are so sad.

79
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,810
Like a spoiled young boy is
one of the saddest things ever.

80
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,920
A young boy that becomes a man and can't
take care of himself and his dad has to

81
00:02:08,921 --> 00:02:10,240
keep on rescuing him.

82
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:13,930
His Dad has to keep on bailing them out
of situations and giving them money.

83
00:02:13,931 --> 00:02:18,190
I've met guys like that and that is a
crippling affliction when they don't have

84
00:02:18,191 --> 00:02:20,560
the character themselves to
be able to get by in life.

85
00:02:20,561 --> 00:02:23,950
They constantly need someone
to help them and bail them out.

86
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:25,120
Even as a grown man,

87
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:29,140
I've met guys in their forties it's
still need help from their parents.

88
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:29,951
I'm like,

89
00:02:29,951 --> 00:02:31,240
what the fuck man,

90
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:35,320
you're never going to get it right because
somewhere along the line they didn't

91
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:38,710
face enough of the university to realize
that there's sometimes you just got to

92
00:02:38,711 --> 00:02:39,970
get up and get shit done.

93
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:44,200
There's sometimes we have to fucking
pull yourself up and you have to push

94
00:02:44,201 --> 00:02:44,651
forward,

95
00:02:44,651 --> 00:02:45,910
even if you want to stay in bed.

96
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:48,880
And if you don't do that and he just
keep calling on your daddy and your daddy

97
00:02:48,881 --> 00:02:49,720
keeps rescuing you,

98
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:51,430
you never developed those tools,

99
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:54,910
you never developed that
ability to recognize what
you're doing wrong with your

100
00:02:54,911 --> 00:02:55,990
life because you're,

101
00:02:55,991 --> 00:02:56,711
you're soft.

102
00:02:56,711 --> 00:02:57,430
You got Cushnie,

103
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:58,300
you've got a safety net,

104
00:02:58,330 --> 00:02:59,770
a safety net for safety net.

105
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:02,260
I have this friend and she has this,

106
00:03:02,261 --> 00:03:02,590
uh,

107
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:07,420
this friend that she's been friends
with for decades and this poor fuck his

108
00:03:07,421 --> 00:03:07,911
family,

109
00:03:07,911 --> 00:03:08,351
super,

110
00:03:08,351 --> 00:03:08,681
super,

111
00:03:08,681 --> 00:03:09,401
super wealthy,

112
00:03:09,401 --> 00:03:10,780
like unbelievable wealthy,

113
00:03:10,781 --> 00:03:11,950
billions of dollars.

114
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,290
And he had not only did he had,

115
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:14,770
uh,

116
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:18,220
he had a trust fund and
a backup trust fund.

117
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:22,270
So he blew through the trust fund and
then he blew through the backup trust

118
00:03:22,271 --> 00:03:23,104
fund,

119
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:26,730
real estate investments and just
disastrous business ventures.

120
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:27,760
No character,

121
00:03:27,761 --> 00:03:28,600
no discipline,

122
00:03:28,601 --> 00:03:29,830
no ability to stick it out,

123
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,780
but incredible amount of resources.

124
00:03:31,781 --> 00:03:33,340
He had millions and millions of dollars,

125
00:03:33,341 --> 00:03:34,780
just pissed it all away,

126
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:36,130
didn't understand it,

127
00:03:36,131 --> 00:03:37,000
completely depressed.

128
00:03:37,001 --> 00:03:38,080
And one day said to her,

129
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:38,920
he said,

130
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:39,161
you know,

131
00:03:39,161 --> 00:03:41,110
cause she has children
as well and she has sons.

132
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,111
He said to her,

133
00:03:42,111 --> 00:03:42,401
he goes,

134
00:03:42,401 --> 00:03:43,061
whatever you do,

135
00:03:43,061 --> 00:03:44,350
do not give your kids money.

136
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:45,700
Don't give them a fucking penny.

137
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:46,271
He goes,

138
00:03:46,271 --> 00:03:47,230
especially boys,

139
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:48,580
don't give them a penny that,

140
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:49,483
that ruined me.

141
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:50,390
Don't give him money.

142
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:50,930
And I was wondering,

143
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:51,810
wow,

144
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,950
that's deep shit to be a man.

145
00:03:53,951 --> 00:03:56,680
Like in your late forties
looking back at your life,

146
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:59,350
this disaster wreckage
that you've put forth,

147
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:02,620
the millions you've blown
now he has like a retail job.

148
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,660
His parents abandoned them.

149
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:05,201
I mean you'll,

150
00:04:05,201 --> 00:04:06,220
you'll look at that and you go,

151
00:04:06,221 --> 00:04:06,731
Whoa,

152
00:04:06,731 --> 00:04:07,270
this is,

153
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:08,800
this is wild shit man.

154
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:09,971
It's a guy.

155
00:04:09,971 --> 00:04:13,480
It's just still struggling from
the way he was developed from the,

156
00:04:13,481 --> 00:04:16,720
the tools that were instilled
in him at a childhood.

157
00:04:16,721 --> 00:04:17,110
And then,

158
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:17,381
you know,

159
00:04:17,381 --> 00:04:22,060
in adolescence and having that safety
net just provided him with a way to stay

160
00:04:22,061 --> 00:04:22,894
in bed,

161
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:24,160
kept him week,

162
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:27,850
never developed character now or
the [inaudible] have an opportunity.

163
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,200
Every time things go wrong.

164
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:31,150
Every time things feel terrible,

165
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:34,750
you have an opportunity to learn from
whatever makes you feel terrible and never

166
00:04:34,751 --> 00:04:35,890
allow it to happen again.

167
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:36,790
Exactly.

168
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,570
Yeah.

169
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:38,021
Thank you.

170
00:04:38,021 --> 00:04:39,010
That's forward.

171
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:39,670
Don't,

172
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:41,080
don't do it again.

173
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:41,740
Yeah.

174
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:42,131
You know,

175
00:04:42,131 --> 00:04:44,170
learn from your mistakes.

176
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,033
We all make them.

177
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:46,990
That's where meditation comes in.

178
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:50,650
Recognizing that and solidifying
it and your head and the,

179
00:04:50,651 --> 00:04:51,730
I believe meditation,

180
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:52,241
the tank,

181
00:04:52,241 --> 00:04:54,550
which is a more magnified
form of meditation.

182
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:57,310
I think it's more intense
and I think that you can,

183
00:04:57,311 --> 00:05:01,300
you could really get something out of
that if with those sort of ideas in your

184
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:02,830
mind about constant,

185
00:05:02,831 --> 00:05:06,250
consistent improvement and it's only
the only thing that you'll allow from

186
00:05:06,251 --> 00:05:08,250
yourself just to maintain
a certain standard.

187
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:10,840
Then consistently trying
to improve and do that,

188
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:11,611
do that and you'll be,

189
00:05:11,611 --> 00:05:12,550
you'll be a happier person.

190
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:17,730
That's an amazing concept there to become
a part of to where you're involved in,

191
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:20,830
you're the Osha instruction
of your own character.

192
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:21,450
Yes.

193
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:25,110
It's through your own efforts and
your own evaluation and then two,

194
00:05:25,111 --> 00:05:28,420
to make the right steps and make the
right decisions that to become even

195
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:30,100
stronger as you go.

196
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:39,920
Okay.
