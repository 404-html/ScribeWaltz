1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,560
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,610 --> 00:00:02,130
Can I answer?

3
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:04,020
Can I give a shout out and
can I tell you one story?

4
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:05,140
Are you giving a shout out?

5
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:08,530
Are you a black guy or a white rapper?

6
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:10,390
And I give a shit is happening here

7
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:13,260
to give a shout out to one guy who I met,

8
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,270
he's a guy named Matt Ruskin,

9
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:16,200
right?

10
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:20,320
And he was in the marines in Iraq
and they had these five clubs in,

11
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:20,941
in Iraq.

12
00:00:20,941 --> 00:00:24,120
And they would do the marine
for like forest week on these,

13
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:25,620
these were tough motherfuckers.

14
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:27,600
And he was doing this,

15
00:00:27,601 --> 00:00:28,020
uh,

16
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:31,020
they'd had these bike clubs and they
would fight them the fuck out of each

17
00:00:31,021 --> 00:00:31,620
other.

18
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:32,321
And he,

19
00:00:32,321 --> 00:00:33,480
he's like 200 pounds.

20
00:00:33,481 --> 00:00:35,130
And he would fight guys who were two 50.

21
00:00:35,131 --> 00:00:36,330
He would fight guys or one 50.

22
00:00:36,331 --> 00:00:36,890
He was fighting,

23
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:37,723
he would beat them all.

24
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:40,230
And he came back and he started doing MMA.

25
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:43,260
He started finding him and me
and he hooked up with this guy,

26
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:45,570
one of the Gracies and,

27
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,390
and you're taught him Brazilian Jujitsu,

28
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:50,070
of which he was I believe,

29
00:00:50,071 --> 00:00:52,320
five time world champion.

30
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:53,453
Uh,

31
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:54,630
the Gracie,

32
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:55,600
which guy?

33
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,970
I'm forgetting his fucking name.

34
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:58,470
He's fucking amazing.

35
00:00:58,770 --> 00:00:59,770
He is amazing.

36
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:00,640
Crazy.

37
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:00,881
Yeah.

38
00:01:00,881 --> 00:01:03,770
He's a Gracie and I went
down to visit Roger Gracie.

39
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:05,330
See?

40
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:05,791
Well wait,

41
00:01:05,791 --> 00:01:08,580
is he a compete at
heavyweight heavyweight?

42
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:09,091
He was heavy.

43
00:01:09,091 --> 00:01:14,091
We was five time World Brazilian
Jujitsu champion and uh,

44
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,710
see I'm going to get no hoe.

45
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,190
Hollis Gracie's very
famous but well Hollis,

46
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:21,780
the son of holes,

47
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:22,623
right?

48
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:24,580
It's great.

49
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:26,550
I'm going to get in shit
for forgetting his name.

50
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:27,481
That's okay.

51
00:01:27,481 --> 00:01:28,111
Thinking about it first.

52
00:01:28,111 --> 00:01:29,310
He's a real good looking guy.

53
00:01:29,311 --> 00:01:31,110
He was a model.

54
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,180
Real good looking guy.

55
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:37,440
Hickson Hickson is the most handsome
of all time and the greatest of all.

56
00:01:37,441 --> 00:01:39,840
This guy was actually a model in Brazil.

57
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:41,063
I'm not gay.

58
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,240
And Matt Ruskin,

59
00:01:42,241 --> 00:01:42,841
if you can,

60
00:01:42,841 --> 00:01:43,870
if you can tweet me.

61
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,120
He was a model.

62
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:46,511
Yeah.

63
00:01:46,511 --> 00:01:47,710
Model and a great fight.

64
00:01:47,711 --> 00:01:52,711
Somebody lied to you and guide and
structure at Sears and five time global to

65
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:54,550
champion.

66
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:57,700
We are now in a swamp of disinformation.

67
00:01:57,730 --> 00:01:57,851
No,

68
00:01:57,851 --> 00:01:58,480
it's true.

69
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,800
No wick PDA.

70
00:01:59,801 --> 00:02:01,910
And if someone can tweet us right now,

71
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:02,341
problem,

72
00:02:02,341 --> 00:02:04,720
we don't have a great Matt,

73
00:02:04,721 --> 00:02:05,554
how are you?

74
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:06,723
Okay.

75
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:08,810
I'm here with Joe Rogan.

76
00:02:08,811 --> 00:02:10,760
We're talking about the Gracies.

77
00:02:10,761 --> 00:02:12,290
Let me talk to this and I'm saying,

78
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:13,430
who's the Gracie?

79
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:14,241
Daniel.

80
00:02:14,241 --> 00:02:15,074
Gracie.

81
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:15,440
Well,

82
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,150
Daniel Daniel Gracie world.

83
00:02:17,151 --> 00:02:18,800
Uget you champion how many times?

84
00:02:18,801 --> 00:02:19,634
Three times.

85
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:22,753
Okay.

86
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:23,531
Yeah,

87
00:02:23,531 --> 00:02:24,040
so he's,

88
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:24,873
he's a global.

89
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:25,380
Uh,

90
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:25,540
did you,

91
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:28,450
did you champion a Daniel Gracie?

92
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:29,050
I want,

93
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:30,110
I'm going to put you on a Rogan.

94
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:30,963
Hold on a second.

95
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:32,123
Talking to him,

96
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:33,131
by the way,

97
00:02:33,131 --> 00:02:34,810
Matt Ruskin is a fucking awesome dude.

98
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:36,093
And Matt.

99
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,360
Yeah.

100
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,193
What's going on in,

101
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:38,970
how's everything?

102
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:39,620
Can you hear it?

103
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:40,453
Yeah.

104
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:40,771
Uh,

105
00:02:40,771 --> 00:02:41,760
what's up Matt w.

106
00:02:41,761 --> 00:02:43,020
W.

107
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:44,820
W how do you know powerful?

108
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:47,040
Shane Smith from vice.com

109
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:53,290
shaved Smith walked
into a fucking work and

110
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:57,610
they told him he needed to lose
weight if you were going to die.

111
00:02:57,890 --> 00:02:58,520
How rude.

112
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,710
Because first of how rude,

113
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,690
how bout how bout,

114
00:03:01,691 --> 00:03:02,170
hey,

115
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:02,861
settle down.

116
00:03:02,861 --> 00:03:03,401
First of all,

117
00:03:03,401 --> 00:03:05,860
how about you tell him first
and foremost that you love them.

118
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:07,490
You don't have to go right into the meat.

119
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:07,900
You're,

120
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:09,760
you're a fat fuck and you're going to die.

121
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,190
He knows how much you love him.

122
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,450
You say that,

123
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:18,060
but is that touch alleviate the
pressure of your own personal oh,

124
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:18,371
no.

125
00:03:18,371 --> 00:03:19,240
Gay stuff.

126
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:21,220
This is a late night podcasts.

127
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:23,650
Misses a lot of dudes and
elicited this in the shower.

128
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:25,271
I'm sorry.

129
00:03:25,271 --> 00:03:26,104
Keep going

130
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,353
Matt.

131
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:31,840
No gay stuff,

132
00:03:31,841 --> 00:03:32,674
Bro.

133
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:34,690
This is late night.

134
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:42,130
I did some work with midwives before,

135
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:43,060
before five land.

136
00:03:43,061 --> 00:03:46,150
They did this whole thing of me when
I was training for one of my fights.

137
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:47,031
Uh,

138
00:03:47,031 --> 00:03:50,620
they said their friend Thomas
around with me for a while.

139
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,153
Um,

140
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:56,210
tell him about when we went
down with Daniel Gracie.

141
00:03:56,211 --> 00:03:56,740
Yeah.

142
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:57,573
Uh,

143
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,180
Jordan to a weapons bizarre with them.

144
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:01,510
Daniel Gracie.

145
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,313
Yeah.

146
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:05,923
With Daniel.

147
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:07,440
Here's the thing about Daniel Gracie.

148
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:09,850
Daniel Gracie is a very,

149
00:04:09,851 --> 00:04:10,211
very,

150
00:04:10,211 --> 00:04:12,480
very talented Brazilian Jujitsu fighter.

151
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:16,240
But his real last name I don't
believe was initially Gracie.

152
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:17,860
I think he sort of,

153
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,860
and those cousins,

154
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:20,460
his hands,

155
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:21,200
his cousin.

156
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:21,770
Yeah.

157
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:22,521
And I think his,

158
00:04:22,521 --> 00:04:22,751
his,

159
00:04:22,751 --> 00:04:24,290
his mom's name is Gracie,

160
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:27,020
but his dad's name and his
birth name was not Gracie.

161
00:04:27,021 --> 00:04:27,854
Right?

162
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:32,083
Yeah.

163
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:36,230
I believe this is what I believe.

164
00:04:36,231 --> 00:04:38,840
I believe he's a very talented fighter,

165
00:04:38,841 --> 00:04:43,841
but I believe this whole
idea of connecting yourself
to the word Gracie is it is

166
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:48,530
ultimately very self defeating
and when a guy does that,

167
00:04:48,531 --> 00:04:50,230
I almost want to pull them aside.

168
00:04:50,231 --> 00:04:50,991
If the look Daniel,

169
00:04:50,991 --> 00:04:53,690
you're a bad motherfucker or
whatever the fuck your last name is,

170
00:04:53,691 --> 00:04:54,620
it doesn't matter.

171
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:58,820
You know you need to get your head
wrapped around the fact that that's all

172
00:04:58,821 --> 00:04:59,480
bullshit.

173
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:04,480
Gracie is a great name but it's 2013
and when he was competing eight,

174
00:05:05,841 --> 00:05:06,440
nine,

175
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,670
10 whatever the fuck it was,

176
00:05:07,671 --> 00:05:12,671
2000 it doesn't matter what matters is
how good you are and adopting the name.

177
00:05:14,421 --> 00:05:17,300
Gracie almost makes people think like,

178
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:21,670
oh well this guy is trying to get a
little extra attention for for no reason.

179
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:22,310
The the,

180
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:22,491
the,

181
00:05:22,491 --> 00:05:26,390
the world championships or the world
championships and you either mounted guy

182
00:05:26,391 --> 00:05:27,290
who take us back,

183
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,133
you tap him,

184
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:29,090
whatever you do,

185
00:05:29,091 --> 00:05:33,170
you either do or you don't do and it
doesn't matter if your name is Marcello

186
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:35,570
Garcia who's unbelievably respected.

187
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:40,780
I mean Marcel Garcia is the top of
the pyramid when it comes to Brazilian

188
00:05:40,881 --> 00:05:41,421
Jujitsu.

189
00:05:41,421 --> 00:05:44,300
In the world today in 2013 or Gracie,

190
00:05:44,301 --> 00:05:45,200
it doesn't matter.

191
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:46,820
So whatever his name was,

192
00:05:46,821 --> 00:05:47,840
what was his real name?

193
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:53,951
Matt.

194
00:05:53,951 --> 00:05:55,180
How many times you've
been hiding in your life?

195
00:05:55,181 --> 00:05:57,410
Don't lie to me many times.

196
00:05:57,411 --> 00:05:59,090
What have you been hiding your life?

197
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:00,470
Yeah,

198
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:03,590
more than 10 is it more than 10

199
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:04,900
okay.

200
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:05,620
Yes.

201
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:06,453
Okay,

202
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:08,710
so we could probably go camping together.

203
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:11,980
How many times do you eat and pot brownies
and thought about chicks you fingered

204
00:06:11,981 --> 00:06:12,850
when you were 14?

205
00:06:12,851 --> 00:06:14,450
You were really upset like Kyra.

206
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:17,320
Gracie more than 10.

207
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:19,090
That's why I love talking to you,

208
00:06:19,091 --> 00:06:19,924
Matt.

209
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:22,150
Let's keep it together,

210
00:06:22,151 --> 00:06:22,984
Matt.

211
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,180
But there was a few guys that did that.

212
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:25,420
Uh,

213
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:27,160
the Gracie thing where they use,

214
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:30,480
what I'm going to say is Daniel Gracie's,

215
00:06:30,481 --> 00:06:31,470
whatever you want to go,

216
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:32,191
what am I going to say?

217
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:33,240
He's a bad motherfucker,

218
00:06:33,241 --> 00:06:33,501
but oh,

219
00:06:33,501 --> 00:06:34,110
by the way,

220
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:35,640
he took us around Brazil.

221
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:36,750
He took us to the valley.

222
00:06:36,751 --> 00:06:37,351
Tudo Jim's.

223
00:06:37,351 --> 00:06:38,400
He took us to the gyms.

224
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:42,240
He took us with Matt and I
got to say it was fucking,

225
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:42,901
I got to say,

226
00:06:42,901 --> 00:06:45,780
you see a different
level of shit down there.

227
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:47,430
Then you'll see anywhere else they did.

228
00:06:47,431 --> 00:06:49,050
These guys trained like motherfuckers

229
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:51,330
to hear this mat and
do you agree with this?

230
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:06,700
At the time was like the worst of the
worst and we had to go ask the boss if we

231
00:07:07,591 --> 00:07:10,850
could come in here and
tell the boss you're here,

232
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:11,521
no problem.

233
00:07:11,521 --> 00:07:13,040
Just don't film the kids with the guns.

234
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,730
And we're looking around,

235
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:16,680
we're like what kids,

236
00:07:16,681 --> 00:07:17,514
what guns?

237
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:20,310
We take a call like a
left turn down the street

238
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,833
and

239
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:24,850
I mean it was just wall to wall.

240
00:07:24,851 --> 00:07:25,750
14 year olds,

241
00:07:25,751 --> 00:07:28,600
15 year olds with like
military grade weapons.

242
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:30,820
I mean you got to picture the,

243
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,770
it was like one word,

244
00:07:32,771 --> 00:07:33,430
shorts,

245
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:34,263
flip flops,

246
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:39,460
you know like a 1989 Luther Campbell
like gold road chamber to medallion,

247
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:40,783
you know,

248
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:41,451
mouth them,

249
00:07:41,451 --> 00:07:43,470
mouth of the side to
side mount gold teeth,

250
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,620
fucking you know,

251
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:49,060
collapsible stock and forwarded a
cod grenade launcher the whole nine.

252
00:07:49,061 --> 00:07:51,550
I mean these kids were
armed to the fucking teeth

253
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:53,723
and

254
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:58,130
every one that we went down there with
was just looking around like holy shit.

255
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:09,620
You can never end a story by saying like,

256
00:08:09,621 --> 00:08:11,090
Holy Shit,

257
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:15,090
I am a very good story.

258
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:15,910
I was with Matt.

259
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:18,240
However you leave us can say this.

260
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:22,483
I was,

261
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:26,420
I was with Matt was there
was 14 year old kids.

262
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:29,833
Like I said,

263
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:31,320
like,

264
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:31,561
you know,

265
00:08:31,561 --> 00:08:32,570
one of the 11 times,

266
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:33,431
don't lie to me,

267
00:08:33,431 --> 00:08:34,690
Matt say yes,

268
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:37,043
yes.

269
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:38,013
Okay,

270
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:38,741
listen Bro,

271
00:08:38,741 --> 00:08:39,640
I feel what you're saying.

272
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,170
And I was only fucking around.

273
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:45,850
I was filling some dead space where
we're trying to recalibrate our reality

274
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:46,290
duty,

275
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:50,530
your circumstances and your
story being paradigm shifting.

276
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:53,530
I'm not that fucked up.

277
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:54,281
Listen,

278
00:08:54,281 --> 00:08:55,230
I want to tell you Matt,

279
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:56,571
man,

280
00:08:56,571 --> 00:08:57,950
I'm giving you a shout out.

281
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:58,813
I love you.

282
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:01,580
This guy fucking is an awesome guy.

283
00:09:01,581 --> 00:09:03,350
Ex Marine and a fighter.

284
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:04,250
I love you Matt.

285
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:04,951
Matt,

286
00:09:04,951 --> 00:09:05,800
I'm very sorry.

287
00:09:05,801 --> 00:09:08,050
They got dragged into a podcast.

288
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:13,810
It was just a phone call for you and
all the sudden Shane Swiss talking about

289
00:09:13,811 --> 00:09:16,060
some crazy shit and you're like,

290
00:09:16,061 --> 00:09:17,050
God dammit.

291
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:19,350
I got to tell the truth cause I'm Matt.

292
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:20,010
But,

293
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:20,290
but,

294
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:23,020
but then you had Ruskin
and I don't give a fuck.

295
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:25,230
But Daniel Gracie is a
bad ass mother fucker.

296
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:25,760
Yes,

297
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,593
unquestionably,

298
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:28,340
but was his real name Matt

299
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:30,580
would that

300
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:31,831
Daniel Gracie,

301
00:09:31,831 --> 00:09:32,820
what is his real name?

302
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:34,090
Yeah.

303
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:34,220
Hi.

304
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:34,971
The last name,

305
00:09:34,971 --> 00:09:36,400
the family name is Ozzy era.

306
00:09:36,401 --> 00:09:37,700
There were similar as one of the two.

307
00:09:37,701 --> 00:09:38,270
I know.

308
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:38,760
I know.

309
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,020
And I completely,

310
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:40,681
by the way,

311
00:09:40,681 --> 00:09:44,430
I want to let everybody know is no
judgment involved in that whatsoever.

312
00:09:44,431 --> 00:09:49,431
I completely understand why someone
who especially was in a situation where

313
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:53,580
there were a very talented guy and
they were trying to maximize the,

314
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,050
the sort of the,

315
00:09:55,051 --> 00:10:00,051
this red of their name as far as possible
and the word Gracie because of hoists

316
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:06,120
and because of Horian and what they
would they accomplished in UFC one.

317
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:10,770
It was one of the most important
moments in the history of martial arts.

318
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:11,611
Would you agree,

319
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:12,444
Matt?

320
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:14,093
I agree

321
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:14,470
it's,

322
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:19,470
it's for people who don't know the
history of it or weren't there when it's

323
00:10:20,261 --> 00:10:22,270
happening as martial artists,

324
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:24,580
it was one of the most
important moments ever.

325
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,980
It's like all of a sudden we
found out what really works.

326
00:10:26,981 --> 00:10:27,814
Right,

327
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:29,260
right.

328
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:30,670
And those guys,

329
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,291
that name,

330
00:10:32,291 --> 00:10:33,490
that Gracie name,

331
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:39,190
that shit's like cue tips or Kleenex,

332
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,210
you know,

333
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:40,991
it's anonymous.

334
00:10:40,991 --> 00:10:42,370
I don't give a fuck about your tissues.

335
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:47,140
If you have tissues made by
Kraft macaroni and cheese,

336
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:48,760
if they're right next to clean x,

337
00:10:48,761 --> 00:10:50,020
I'm taking the Kleenex.

338
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:50,651
Okay.

339
00:10:50,651 --> 00:10:53,470
Cause they dominate as does the NFL.

340
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:55,360
They dominate as well.

341
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:57,041
You know what I'm saying?

342
00:10:57,041 --> 00:10:57,490
Matt?

343
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:58,930
Jesus Christ back me up.

344
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:01,623
I got to tell you.

345
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,200
I think the name Angela,

346
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:06,830
100% thank you Matt.

347
00:11:06,831 --> 00:11:07,640
Thank you.

348
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,473
In what way?

349
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,190
Like Daniel,

350
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:11,690
Daniel was a

351
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:13,610
all was fighting a bride.

352
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:15,080
They told them to take,

353
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:16,160
take the family name.

354
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:18,610
You know why do you know why

355
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:19,683
they were all fighting it?

356
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:20,970
Do you know why?

357
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,270
Yeah,

358
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:25,940
cause they're smart mother fuckers because
they're smart motherfuckers and they

359
00:11:25,941 --> 00:11:28,670
know how to make that paper son.

360
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:31,753
Hmm.

361
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:32,970
Okay.

362
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:33,803
Hi Matt.

363
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:35,400
Don't don't freeze up on me.

364
00:11:35,401 --> 00:11:38,700
Now we're in the deep end of the pool.

365
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:39,543
Matt,

366
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:42,510
we're not close to the lip hanging there.

367
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:45,000
Did you see the right math teacher?

368
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:45,943
Heather,

369
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,120
are you with me buddy?

370
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:50,481
I'm sorry.

371
00:11:50,481 --> 00:11:50,811
Listen,

372
00:11:50,811 --> 00:11:51,230
Matt,

373
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:53,000
I need to apologize to you as a human.

374
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,600
You didn't know what the
fuck was going on here.

375
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:58,180
You get dragged into this conversation.

376
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,890
Shane Smith calls you.

377
00:11:59,891 --> 00:12:01,450
It's a where do you live,

378
00:12:01,451 --> 00:12:01,870
sir?

379
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:02,031
No,

380
00:12:02,031 --> 00:12:02,770
don't tell me.

381
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:03,580
East Coast,

382
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:05,650
west coast or mountain time.

383
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:09,050
He's coast.

384
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:09,221
Oh,

385
00:12:09,221 --> 00:12:10,220
too late as fuck.

386
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:15,020
What I'm trying to say is
Matt is an awesome dude.

387
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:16,100
Do you hear this mat?

388
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:23,500
He say he said Matt isn't Shane Smith
Just said Matt is an awesome dude and then

389
00:12:24,091 --> 00:12:24,541
your grace.

390
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:26,780
He's an awesome guy and Daniel
grace is an awesome dude.

391
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:28,410
And what and what you showed me

392
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:29,401
credit.

393
00:12:29,401 --> 00:12:30,234
Any of that.

394
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:31,980
We're not trying to discredit any of that.

395
00:12:31,981 --> 00:12:32,221
Matt,

396
00:12:32,221 --> 00:12:32,881
you understand this,

397
00:12:32,881 --> 00:12:33,714
correct?

398
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:36,220
No,

399
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:37,053
not yet.

400
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:38,080
In three minutes.

401
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:39,040
Listen,

402
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:39,821
what's important,

403
00:12:39,821 --> 00:12:40,390
Matt,

404
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:45,390
is you understand that I respect and
adore Daniel Gracie and anybody gets in

405
00:12:46,331 --> 00:12:46,790
there.

406
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:48,390
I just think she had a,

407
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:53,480
I could be have been there when Hendo
and all those other guys are trying to

408
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:55,270
talk Daniel into using the last name.

409
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,193
Gracie.

410
00:12:56,970 --> 00:12:57,091
Oh,

411
00:12:57,091 --> 00:13:00,540
so let's think this shit
through side federally.

412
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,960
Silva did pretty good.

413
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:02,830
What's the name?

414
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:03,420
Silva.

415
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:03,720
Okay.

416
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:03,961
Okay.

417
00:13:03,961 --> 00:13:04,651
We're going to be fine.

418
00:13:04,651 --> 00:13:05,071
We don't need,

419
00:13:05,071 --> 00:13:06,090
Gracie was okay.

420
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:07,043
Are you crazy?

421
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:07,681
That's your name.

422
00:13:07,681 --> 00:13:08,310
Hanzo.

423
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:08,521
Hey,

424
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:09,630
Dez hens,

425
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:10,411
or do you support this?

426
00:13:10,411 --> 00:13:11,191
Daniel character.

427
00:13:11,191 --> 00:13:11,371
Yeah.

428
00:13:11,371 --> 00:13:12,900
What did the fuck difference does it make?

429
00:13:12,901 --> 00:13:17,040
What noise you make with your mouth
that represents his last name?

430
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,090
Are we cool?

431
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:21,180
Jesus Christ for the
greater good of humanity,

432
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:21,661
the world.

433
00:13:21,661 --> 00:13:22,980
How about we forget about

434
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:29,540
imperial dictatorships and names
that dominate sports history.

435
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:31,250
If you feel me,

436
00:13:31,251 --> 00:13:32,084
Matt,

437
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:35,200
did you know eating marijuana
is different if you,

438
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:35,621
hey,

439
00:13:35,621 --> 00:13:36,280
Matt.

440
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:36,940
Matt,

441
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:37,773
Matt.

442
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:39,761
I'm sorry.

443
00:13:39,761 --> 00:13:40,594
Dude.

444
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:41,800
This is so rude.

445
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:43,000
You love him.

446
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:43,511
I love you,

447
00:13:43,511 --> 00:13:43,960
Matt.

448
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:48,960
I'm so sad that I dragged you into this
and even though I did it with no malice,

449
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:51,213
say Matt,

450
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:52,510
Matt,

451
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:53,343
Ruskin,

452
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,480
Bat Ruskin,

453
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:56,270
do this to be mean.

454
00:13:56,450 --> 00:13:58,910
I just did this because that's my nature.

455
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:00,710
I am the Scorpion.

456
00:14:00,711 --> 00:14:01,790
You are the frog.

457
00:14:01,791 --> 00:14:03,410
This is how shit goes down.

458
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:04,820
I didn't mean to do this.

459
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:07,430
Matt Ruskin is a Beautiful Matt Ruskin.

460
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:07,940
Well,

461
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:08,370

462
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:09,810
We do my podcast.

463
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:11,550
Yeah,

464
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:13,050
I would be happy to hear your thoughts,

465
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:13,471
sir.

466
00:14:13,471 --> 00:14:16,080
I'd be honored if you would
do my podcast when we do.

467
00:14:16,081 --> 00:14:17,580
Will you do with Shane?

468
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,280
I would definitely do it with Shane.

469
00:14:20,281 --> 00:14:20,680
Of course

470
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:25,680

a hot tub in San Diego with the dog.

471
00:14:26,381 --> 00:14:27,101
Stop it.

472
00:14:27,101 --> 00:14:32,101
No dolphins and no Sharman I think would
be does ever experiment with a dolphin,

473
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:34,953
Matt?

474
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:37,263
Yeah.

475
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:39,240
Just tell him you love him.

476
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:41,843
Matt.

477
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,330
Have you ever watched a Rodeo
and felt sorry for the bowls

478
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:47,910
that

479
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:48,510
nothing.

480
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:48,901
Listen,

481
00:14:48,901 --> 00:14:49,734

00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:52,040
even though we've never

484
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:52,873
met.

485
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:53,870
He's a good man.

486
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:56,960
If Shane Smith says you're good,

487
00:14:56,961 --> 00:14:57,710
man,

488
00:14:57,710 --> 00:14:58,580
you're a good man.

489
00:14:58,581 --> 00:14:59,414
Do you feel me?

490
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:00,800
All right,

491
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,633
let's move.

492
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:03,950
Okay.

493
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:04,783
Jihad.

494
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:05,430
Oh,

495
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:05,740
cooking.

496
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:06,770
That was one of the most,

497
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:08,600
the least entertaining

498
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,260
did that broke my face.

499
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:12,630
That's,

500
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:17,390
that's got with one of the funniest
shit things I've ever seen in my life.

501
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:18,380
My face hurts.

502
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:23,550
[inaudible]

503
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:53,330
