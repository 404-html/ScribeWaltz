1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:02,490
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:04,080
What's it like hanging
out with those guys?

3
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:05,183
I listened junk.

4
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:06,390
When I went in there,

5
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:07,710
I told myself,

6
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:09,420
I ain't talking to nobody.

7
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:10,793
All right,

8
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:14,510
I'm going to speak when spoken to,

9
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:15,420
um,

10
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:18,330
there was a part when they were
kind of lighting the narrow and I,

11
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,470
and were standing face to face and he's
looking at me and I'm looking right at

12
00:00:22,471 --> 00:00:22,950
him and um,

13
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:24,300
I wasn't gonna say nothing.

14
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:26,420
And then he comes in and my,

15
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:27,570
my tiny,

16
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:32,070
tiny needs to be tight and a
little bit and he cinched my tie

17
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:36,660
straight down.

18
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:38,940
So yeah,

19
00:00:38,941 --> 00:00:39,900
I had a wig.

20
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,700
They put me in a wig.

21
00:00:41,701 --> 00:00:42,970
And what kind of wig would it look like?

22
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:44,191
Actually,

23
00:00:44,191 --> 00:00:45,024
there's there,

24
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:49,590
if you type up Sebastian Maniscalco
Irishman that it should pop up.

25
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:50,941
Yeah,

26
00:00:50,941 --> 00:00:51,660
there it is.

27
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:52,411
What is the difference?

28
00:00:52,411 --> 00:00:53,244
You know,

29
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:55,500
I'm so confused.

30
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:56,670
Why did they give you a wig?

31
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:58,920
It's got sideburns.

32
00:00:58,980 --> 00:00:59,221
I mean,

33
00:00:59,221 --> 00:00:59,521
if you,

34
00:00:59,521 --> 00:01:00,990
if you see it in person,

35
00:01:00,991 --> 00:01:02,640
you'll understand maybe why I have,

36
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:04,180
yeah.

37
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:06,510
It's not that much of a departure from,

38
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:07,230
from my,

39
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:07,921
my real hair.

40
00:01:07,921 --> 00:01:08,281
But,

41
00:01:08,281 --> 00:01:09,114
uh,

42
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:11,680
did they give you the option of
growing sideburns and you like it?

43
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:12,611
No,

44
00:01:12,611 --> 00:01:13,750
they just said again,

45
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:15,430
I didn't say nothing.

46
00:01:15,431 --> 00:01:16,600
They said you're going to wear a wig.

47
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:17,200
No,

48
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:17,770
no problem.

49
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:18,640
Whatever you want me to do.

50
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:20,320
Scorsese was like,

51
00:01:20,321 --> 00:01:20,800
um,

52
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:21,251
okay.

53
00:01:21,251 --> 00:01:21,700
Um,

54
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:25,510
there's a part where I'm going to
go through a window and he's like,

55
00:01:25,511 --> 00:01:25,751
okay,

56
00:01:25,751 --> 00:01:26,740
when you go through the window,

57
00:01:26,741 --> 00:01:27,090
and I'm like,

58
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:27,923
Oh,

59
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:28,900
I'm going to a window.

60
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:30,690
Cause I knew there was
a stunt guy involved.

61
00:01:30,691 --> 00:01:31,524
Right.

62
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:35,050
But he's telling me that I'm going to
go to the window and I wasn't going to

63
00:01:35,051 --> 00:01:35,770
say,

64
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:37,060
I don't do windows.

65
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:40,010
You want me to go to the window,

66
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:40,870
got to a window.

67
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,980
I'm not gonna tell Martin Scorsese op,

68
00:01:42,981 --> 00:01:43,391
sorry.

69
00:01:43,391 --> 00:01:43,571
I,

70
00:01:43,571 --> 00:01:43,900
uh,

71
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:44,733
need a stunt guy.

72
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:45,700
Um,

73
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:46,271
but then they said,

74
00:01:46,271 --> 00:01:47,130
hey Marty,

75
00:01:47,131 --> 00:01:48,190
there is a stunt guy here.

76
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:48,670
He goes,

77
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:49,111
oh,

78
00:01:49,111 --> 00:01:49,510
okay.

79
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:49,991
So,

80
00:01:49,991 --> 00:01:50,420
uh,

81
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:51,820
I was ready to go through the window.

82
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:52,940
I can't wear necklaces.

83
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:53,480
A man,

84
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,313
it bugs me.

85
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:55,690
Did you ever wear necklaces?

86
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:56,740
More necklaces?

87
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:57,603
Sure.

88
00:01:57,790 --> 00:01:58,990
It's never been a staple,

89
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:00,333
but it's a,

90
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:00,851
it's a,

91
00:02:00,851 --> 00:02:02,740
it's a weird thing if,

92
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,191
first of all,

93
00:02:03,191 --> 00:02:03,880
if it's,

94
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:04,810
if it's big enough,

95
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,920
it's like this target,

96
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:06,131
right?

97
00:02:06,131 --> 00:02:08,290
If you have like a bill gold necklace,

98
00:02:08,291 --> 00:02:09,124
people want to steal it.

99
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:09,720
All right?

100
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,380
There's a lot of Nicholas
snatchers out there.

101
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:11,631
Brian,

102
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:12,464
I don't know if you know that.

103
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:13,323
Yeah.

104
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:14,410
But then the other thing is,

105
00:02:14,411 --> 00:02:15,244
uh,

106
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:16,443
like what are you doing?

107
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,240
What are you doing with that big
old shiny thing around your neck?

108
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:19,871
What are you doing?

109
00:02:19,871 --> 00:02:20,670
What are you at chick?

110
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:21,700
Remember in the 90s,

111
00:02:21,701 --> 00:02:24,550
chokers where thing and
I used to wear a choker.

112
00:02:24,551 --> 00:02:26,830
How Christmas is like a dog choker.

113
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:28,690
It's just a really tight necklace.

114
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:31,480
Hemp necklaces.

115
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:32,321
Oh yeah.

116
00:02:32,321 --> 00:02:33,370
Those are the little bead.

117
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:34,780
The bead at the bottom.

118
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:36,760
The beads critical kind of have the bead.

119
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:37,690
Yeah.

120
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:40,150
Multi colored bead
making look at your cool.

121
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:41,381
Yeah.

122
00:02:41,381 --> 00:02:46,381
Like it's weird like some guys will wear
like little anklets with like beads.

123
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:50,020
Can they tie them off and they'll
walk around barefoot and you're like,

124
00:02:50,021 --> 00:02:50,860
okay,

125
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:52,000
hmm.

126
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,130
What's kind of like that
look that they are not shop.

127
00:02:54,131 --> 00:02:55,870
Look where you have like the really tight,

128
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,810
like your pants go up so
you can see your socks.

129
00:02:58,811 --> 00:02:59,140
You,

130
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:00,220
you show a little leg.

131
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:01,120
You know why they do that?

132
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:02,080
Why sneakers?

133
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:05,050
Those guys are all show
off the sneakers full.

134
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:06,250
That's what shop told me.

135
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:07,150
Do you do that Jeremy?

136
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:08,290
That's what my,

137
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:10,120
my pants have that actually before you do.

138
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,730
That's how the Pennsylvania,

139
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,310
that's funny.

140
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:16,240
That's how the pants are made.

141
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:18,130
You don't buy those pants man.

142
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,540
That then you're not buying pants.

143
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:21,850
Where do you buy your lady store?

144
00:03:21,851 --> 00:03:22,270
Do you buy,

145
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:23,140
do you buy it at coach?

146
00:03:23,141 --> 00:03:23,974
Do you buy those pants?

147
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:25,270
[inaudible] Gosh,

148
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:26,530
that's hilarious.

149
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:27,341
You don't do that too.

150
00:03:27,341 --> 00:03:27,830
You know?

151
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:28,663
How dare you?

152
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,433
How dare you.

153
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:32,560
Fudge are a little weird.

154
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:34,120
So I have to ask you,

155
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,670
does Tom talk about Ufos all the time?

156
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:37,161
Well,

157
00:03:37,161 --> 00:03:38,170
you know he's not in the band.

158
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:38,830
Yeah,

159
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:39,610
I know,

160
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:40,030
but you know,

161
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:40,720
always do that.

162
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,150
He always did what?

163
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:46,930
Used to get loaded and just look out the
bus window and I used to do it with him

164
00:03:46,931 --> 00:03:47,410
as like,

165
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:47,651
I don't know,

166
00:03:47,651 --> 00:03:49,030
it's kind of a bonding experience.

167
00:03:49,031 --> 00:03:49,864
It's like,

168
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,330
if you wanted to show me bow and arrows,

169
00:03:52,331 --> 00:03:53,530
whatever were on tour together,

170
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:54,660
I'd sit there and like,

171
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:54,910
you know,

172
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:55,390
check it out.

173
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:56,440
So with Tom,

174
00:03:56,441 --> 00:03:57,161
that was his thing.

175
00:03:57,161 --> 00:04:01,220
Like fucking let's get
high and look for Ufo here.

176
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,670
We just sit there and like
stare out the bus window,

177
00:04:03,671 --> 00:04:07,390
look at you fos or like he would
even go as far as when we're on tour,

178
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,780
like let's go and
fucking look for bigfoot,

179
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:11,800
whatever it was,

180
00:04:11,801 --> 00:04:12,490
you know,

181
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:14,980
and he would assemble a crew
and they would go do it.

182
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:15,820
Oh my God,

183
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:19,270
I never got me on one of those trips
cause that was just two fairy tale for me.

184
00:04:19,271 --> 00:04:20,104
But um,

185
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:20,950
but I would,

186
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:21,191
you know,

187
00:04:21,191 --> 00:04:22,870
I'd do that and he was always,

188
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:28,080
it's really not something he just got
into from the day I fucking met him while

189
00:04:28,301 --> 00:04:32,920
he was obsessed with Ufos and aliens and
was always very passionate about it to

190
00:04:32,921 --> 00:04:33,754
the point where like,

191
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:36,160
I didn't know enough to,

192
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:38,530
to have any kind of,

193
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,940
I guess like opinion on it.

194
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:41,700
I was just very open and,

195
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:42,670
and you know,

196
00:04:42,671 --> 00:04:43,720
just took it all in,

197
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:46,240
but nothing has changed.

198
00:04:46,241 --> 00:04:47,074
He's still,

199
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:47,861
the other day I talked to him,

200
00:04:47,861 --> 00:04:48,041
he's like,

201
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:49,540
I'm on the way to the
fucking White House Bro.

202
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:52,420
And I don't ask any questions.

203
00:04:52,421 --> 00:04:53,254
I just be like,

204
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:54,250
as you should be,

205
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:54,620
you know,

206
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:55,453
whatever.

207
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:56,860
Let's fucking go.

208
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,473
Yeah,

209
00:04:58,780 --> 00:04:59,770
great response.

210
00:04:59,771 --> 00:05:00,250
Yeah.

211
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:01,090
Good luck with that.

212
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,020
Yup.

213
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:03,010
Wow.

214
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:04,061
Long story short,

215
00:05:04,061 --> 00:05:04,331
he goes,

216
00:05:04,331 --> 00:05:04,661
okay,

217
00:05:04,661 --> 00:05:05,494
you can go,

218
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:07,150
but you have to take this blessing.

219
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:08,231
And we're like,

220
00:05:08,231 --> 00:05:08,441
sure,

221
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:10,420
we'll whatever you need for us to go.

222
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:12,340
So he pulls out the snail shell.

223
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:13,330
I could show you a picture of it.

224
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:18,160
It's a snail shell with a monkey bone
and the top and a tube worm to close it.

225
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:21,220
And in the snail shell is the
green powder and he's like,

226
00:05:21,221 --> 00:05:22,600
this is what you need for the blessing.

227
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:25,930
So he goes around the circle
and threw a monkey bone pipe.

228
00:05:25,931 --> 00:05:27,190
He blows this green stuff.

229
00:05:27,191 --> 00:05:27,761
And your nose,

230
00:05:27,761 --> 00:05:28,570
is it called the COO?

231
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:29,403
Hey,

232
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,480
not as like that word that we heard.

233
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:33,340
I couldn't tell the name of the pipe.

234
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:33,671
No,

235
00:05:33,671 --> 00:05:33,821
no.

236
00:05:33,821 --> 00:05:34,720
The stuff they blow up.

237
00:05:34,721 --> 00:05:36,370
Your nose is a DMT.

238
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:36,761
It,

239
00:05:36,761 --> 00:05:37,960
it's coca leaf.

240
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:38,770
Oh,

241
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:42,450
mixed with a bunch of a root and
tobacco I believe like all together.

242
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:43,480
And um,

243
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,150
anyway,

244
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:44,531
so he goes,

245
00:05:44,531 --> 00:05:45,520
there's five of us in my crew.

246
00:05:45,521 --> 00:05:47,740
He goes around the circle and he
hits three guys and they will go,

247
00:05:47,741 --> 00:05:48,191
Whoa,

248
00:05:48,191 --> 00:05:50,260
my brain feels like I've
got chlorine on the head,

249
00:05:50,261 --> 00:05:50,471
you know,

250
00:05:50,471 --> 00:05:51,930
whatever loads it into your nose.

251
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:52,180
Yeah.

252
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:53,110
So it gets really close.

253
00:05:53,111 --> 00:05:57,070
It's got this long tubular monkey bone
pipe and he goes and it just blows it up

254
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:59,450
your nose and a hits.

255
00:05:59,451 --> 00:06:00,081
Three of my guys,

256
00:06:00,081 --> 00:06:03,470
and I'm watching a little bit nervous
cause like I'm very like standoffish on

257
00:06:03,471 --> 00:06:03,801
drugs.

258
00:06:03,801 --> 00:06:06,170
Like I know things
affect me very strangely.

259
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:06,471
Anyway,

260
00:06:06,471 --> 00:06:07,281
hits three of my guys,

261
00:06:07,281 --> 00:06:07,521
they go,

262
00:06:07,521 --> 00:06:07,940
Whoa,

263
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:08,181
you know,

264
00:06:08,181 --> 00:06:09,530
eyes watering and they're like,

265
00:06:09,531 --> 00:06:09,801
wow,

266
00:06:09,801 --> 00:06:10,050
it's a,

267
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:11,180
it's actually a great feeling.

268
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:12,410
Gets to my turn

269
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:15,013
in the nose.

270
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:18,440
All of a sudden I feel like
I've got acid on my brain,

271
00:06:18,441 --> 00:06:19,640
like chlorine in my head.

272
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:21,290
I break into the sweat,

273
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:25,070
my eyes explode and I'm
like wobbling like this.

274
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:29,510
And it 30 seconds later I'm just
curled over in the fetal position,

275
00:06:29,511 --> 00:06:32,630
just projectile vomiting
cannot hold it together.

276
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:33,650
And uh,

277
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:34,221
Lorenzo,

278
00:06:34,221 --> 00:06:34,461
this,

279
00:06:34,461 --> 00:06:34,821
the,

280
00:06:34,821 --> 00:06:37,370
the tribal shaman goes good,

281
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:38,151
good.

282
00:06:38,151 --> 00:06:38,601
And we're like,

283
00:06:38,601 --> 00:06:39,411
why is this good?

284
00:06:39,411 --> 00:06:39,771
And he's like,

285
00:06:39,771 --> 00:06:41,210
he had a bad spirit in him.

286
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,530
If he had gone up the river,

287
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:43,640
he would have been killed.

288
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:45,140
He's just got the bad spirit out.

289
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:46,430
This is why I had to bless you.

290
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,630
Now you can go.

291
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,960
And I was the only one that had hit
like that out of our five person crew.

292
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:51,740
Everybody else was like,

293
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:51,921
Ooh,

294
00:06:51,921 --> 00:06:52,640
my brain sore,

295
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,061
whatever.

296
00:06:53,061 --> 00:06:55,100
I was literally fetal position,

297
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:56,240
feverish,

298
00:06:56,241 --> 00:06:57,350
puking cray.

299
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:59,900
And I've never done any
drugs like hard drugs.

300
00:06:59,901 --> 00:07:01,340
Like it's just not my thing.

301
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:04,220
And this thing just hit
me like a ton of brick.

302
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:05,051
But,

303
00:07:05,051 --> 00:07:06,310
so the Liam Neeson thing,

304
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:07,601
and you know,

305
00:07:07,601 --> 00:07:08,860
forgive me if I,

306
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:11,560
if there's some detail that has
come out that I'm not aware of,

307
00:07:11,561 --> 00:07:14,530
but my understanding of it is he,

308
00:07:14,531 --> 00:07:14,711
you know,

309
00:07:14,711 --> 00:07:19,480
he had a friend who was raped and
then he reported this state of mind,

310
00:07:19,481 --> 00:07:24,250
this murderous state of mind he was
in where he was walking around with,

311
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:26,960
I think he calls it a a,

312
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,270
that's a British word for like,

313
00:07:28,271 --> 00:07:28,510
uh,

314
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:28,931
it's like,

315
00:07:28,931 --> 00:07:29,100
uh,

316
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,340
a small metal club.

317
00:07:30,341 --> 00:07:31,174
Right?

318
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:32,133
Um,

319
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:35,020
there's like a black jack
or like another term for it,

320
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:35,680
I think.

321
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:40,680
And I'm looking for a black eye to kill a,

322
00:07:41,251 --> 00:07:41,411
you know,

323
00:07:41,411 --> 00:07:41,561
like,

324
00:07:41,561 --> 00:07:44,410
it doesn't hoping someone's going to come
out of the woodwork and threatened him

325
00:07:44,411 --> 00:07:49,411
so that he could kill this guy in this
act of instrumental violence because his

326
00:07:49,631 --> 00:07:51,100
friend had been raped by a black guy.

327
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:51,300
Right.

328
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,630
Just like any black guy will do.

329
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:52,781
Now.

330
00:07:52,781 --> 00:07:53,051
That's,

331
00:07:53,051 --> 00:07:53,950
that's sort of like the,

332
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:58,570
the extra horrific wrinkle
to the story right now.

333
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:04,260
And he's confessing this as a kind of
a symptom of transient mental illness,

334
00:08:04,661 --> 00:08:05,750
at least as far as I know.

335
00:08:05,751 --> 00:08:06,001
It was like,

336
00:08:06,001 --> 00:08:06,081
Hey,

337
00:08:06,081 --> 00:08:09,010
he's horrified by the fact that
he was in the state of mind.

338
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:09,161
Right.

339
00:08:09,161 --> 00:08:11,050
Can you imagine like the Liam Neeson,

340
00:08:11,051 --> 00:08:11,884
that an actor?

341
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:12,870
Uh,

342
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:16,010
I have everything to lose and
although I don't remember why,

343
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:17,950
at what point in his life
he said this happened.

344
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:18,850
Um,

345
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:20,290
can you imagine that?

346
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:21,580
I was in the state of mind.

347
00:08:21,581 --> 00:08:22,270
Right?

348
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:23,350
And this is,

349
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:24,520
as you say,

350
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,500
an all too honest disclosure,

351
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:30,160
but it is damn interesting.

352
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:30,730
Right?

353
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:35,080
And it is the kind of thing that
we should be able to talk about.

354
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:35,561
Right?

355
00:08:35,561 --> 00:08:36,430
And it's not,

356
00:08:36,431 --> 00:08:41,431
and the fact that this is becoming
synonymous with racism seems just wrong

357
00:08:41,831 --> 00:08:42,430
given,

358
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:43,360
given how he's,

359
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:44,201
he described,

360
00:08:44,201 --> 00:08:45,100
or at least how I've,

361
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,930
I've heard this because he's saying,

362
00:08:46,931 --> 00:08:47,231
listen,

363
00:08:47,231 --> 00:08:52,060
if this had been an Armenian guy
or an Italian or a Japanese guy,

364
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:53,470
I'd be looking for one of them.

365
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:53,711
Right?

366
00:08:53,711 --> 00:08:53,950
I mean,

367
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:54,141
what,

368
00:08:54,141 --> 00:08:54,550
what,

369
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:55,383
what this,

370
00:08:55,950 --> 00:09:00,840
at least on his talent is the
virus of instrumental violence.

371
00:09:00,841 --> 00:09:00,991
I mean,

372
00:09:00,991 --> 00:09:03,780
the vi the virus of like,

373
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:07,960
this is how every blood feud ever
in human history gets started.

374
00:09:07,961 --> 00:09:08,794
It's like you,

375
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:11,700
like someone from your
tribe killed my brother.

376
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:15,600
And now what I want to do is
kill anyone from your tribe.

377
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:15,841
Right?

378
00:09:15,841 --> 00:09:16,674
Doesn't matter who.

379
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,310
Right.

380
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:17,761
And,

381
00:09:17,761 --> 00:09:18,870
and that's,

382
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:19,801
you know,

383
00:09:19,801 --> 00:09:22,620
clearly as toxic as it gets,

384
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,011
you know,

385
00:09:23,011 --> 00:09:23,844
ethically.

386
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:26,160
But that's not racism.

387
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:26,551
Right?

388
00:09:26,551 --> 00:09:27,384
That's just,

389
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:29,640
that is that we have a word for it.

390
00:09:29,641 --> 00:09:29,980
It's in,

391
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:31,260
it's instrumental violence.

392
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:32,610
Um,

393
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:33,390
but you know,

394
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:33,661
yeah.

395
00:09:33,661 --> 00:09:36,060
Obviously he's getting
totally pilloried over this.

396
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:36,810
Uh,

397
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:37,680
but we need,

398
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:44,270
we just need to figure out how to talk
about how people can redeem themselves

399
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:48,040
once something this unsavory is,

400
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:49,890
is revealed about their past,

401
00:09:49,891 --> 00:09:51,360
whether they reveal it
or whether it's just,

402
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:51,930
you know,

403
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:52,690
found out about [inaudible].

404
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:55,600
What people don't seem to realize when
it comes to history is that when you read

405
00:09:55,601 --> 00:09:56,590
about World War II,

406
00:09:56,710 --> 00:10:00,010
we've condensed all the highlights into
a very short paragraph or a series of

407
00:10:00,011 --> 00:10:00,471
paragraphs.

408
00:10:00,471 --> 00:10:02,350
And you don't realize the
war was several years.

409
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:04,090
There were periods where nothing happened,

410
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:05,050
right?

411
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:07,480
I was in Egypt during
the second revolution.

412
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:11,290
You could look down and you could
see Tahrir Square people screaming,

413
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:11,831
laser pointers,

414
00:10:11,831 --> 00:10:12,401
helicopters,

415
00:10:12,401 --> 00:10:13,234
Apaches.

416
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:14,440
And they announced in the news,

417
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:15,040
we've just,

418
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,870
we've deposed the
president two blocks away.

419
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:19,930
A dude's eating a cheeseburger at
Mcdonald's watching a football match as if

420
00:10:19,931 --> 00:10:20,764
nothing's happening.

421
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:22,690
So when you look at the street battles,

422
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,620
the political violence,

423
00:10:23,621 --> 00:10:24,680
when you look at the,

424
00:10:24,681 --> 00:10:24,891
the,

425
00:10:24,891 --> 00:10:27,220
the bias Banning's you look at the dude,

426
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:31,090
there was a guy who fired a couple of
rounds at a police officer and Eugene,

427
00:10:31,091 --> 00:10:34,690
Oregon and some bombs got planted at the
police department or somebody planted

428
00:10:34,691 --> 00:10:36,070
bombs that a statue in Houston.

429
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:40,060
It starts to feel like there's some kind
of political violence that is bubbling

430
00:10:40,061 --> 00:10:41,620
up that can't be mended at this point.

431
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:45,430
And a lot of this comes from the
suppression that we're talking about where

432
00:10:45,431 --> 00:10:49,150
people don't feel like they have a voice
or that voice is being suppressed by an

433
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:50,380
opposing ideologies,

434
00:10:50,381 --> 00:10:51,190
you know?

435
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:52,000
Yes.

436
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,380
But it is really complicated and it's,

437
00:10:53,381 --> 00:10:53,840
it's,

438
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,040
I,

439
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,380
I can't claim to know
how everything happens,

440
00:10:56,381 --> 00:11:01,030
but what I will say is I believe social
media is responsible for the political

441
00:11:01,031 --> 00:11:01,570
violence.

442
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:02,260
I believe it's,

443
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:02,530
uh,

444
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:03,700
it's not just about suppression.

445
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:05,580
It's you,

446
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,281
you look at,

447
00:11:06,281 --> 00:11:06,820
um,

448
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:08,200
the systems that were built Facebook,

449
00:11:08,201 --> 00:11:08,800
right?

450
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,620
What content can make it to the
front page of your Facebook posts,

451
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:12,910
of your Facebook profile.

452
00:11:12,911 --> 00:11:14,290
When you're looking at your
newsfeed while Twitter,

453
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:17,110
Facebook has to build an algorithm
to determine what matters.

454
00:11:17,111 --> 00:11:20,890
Most companies then figure out how to
manipulate that algorithm to get that

455
00:11:20,891 --> 00:11:21,790
content in front of you.

456
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:22,571
Because you know,

457
00:11:22,571 --> 00:11:24,520
at most even see what
three posts on Facebook.

458
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:26,350
So what happens is early on,

459
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:31,510
companies quickly found out that anger
drives the most shares of any emotion.

460
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:34,120
All of a sudden we see a wave
of police brutality videos.

461
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:38,290
There was one website that posted almost
exclusively police brutality content,

462
00:11:38,291 --> 00:11:39,160
and it was like Alexa,

463
00:11:39,161 --> 00:11:40,630
400 in the world,

464
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:42,520
some ridiculously high
number of blew my mind.

465
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:43,270
I knew Pete,

466
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:43,600
uh,

467
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,880
someone claims to that
they're making six figures,

468
00:11:45,881 --> 00:11:49,630
writing police brutality articles
because it was pure rage bait,

469
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:50,380
right?

470
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:52,000
Content that just shares really easily,

471
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:56,380
but that constantly being put in
front of somebody breeds an ideology.

472
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:57,730
You then tell someone,

473
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,380
did you know that?

474
00:11:59,381 --> 00:11:59,621
You know,

475
00:11:59,621 --> 00:12:03,160
white supremacy is on the rise and there
are 11 million white supremacists in

476
00:12:03,161 --> 00:12:04,270
the U S and they go,

477
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,133
I can believe it.

478
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:06,161
But that's nonsense.

479
00:12:06,161 --> 00:12:06,720
It's just not,

480
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,570
there's not the case.

481
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:08,141
You know,

482
00:12:08,141 --> 00:12:11,260
the Anti Defamation League and the
SPLC say that we're at rough estimates,

483
00:12:11,261 --> 00:12:12,520
or maybe like 10 or 12,000,

484
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:15,220
but people really believe that there is,

485
00:12:15,221 --> 00:12:19,540
like at the president does secretly a
Nazi and that he's being propped up by the

486
00:12:19,541 --> 00:12:20,291
secret cabal,

487
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:23,710
or there's an alternative influence
network on Youtube where you and me or

488
00:12:23,711 --> 00:12:25,900
somehow trying to convince people to,

489
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:26,111
you know,

490
00:12:26,111 --> 00:12:26,944
this is ridiculous.

491
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:27,640
Okay.
