1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:01,463
And we're live.
Are you going to update the people out 

2
00:00:04,741 --> 00:00:05,390
there?
No.

3
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:06,223
Oh,
you shut your phone off while you're a 

4
00:00:06,571 --> 00:00:08,890
professional drone racer.
Good.

5
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:09,630
Going.
Well,

6
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:10,870
it's going on.
Um,

7
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:13,590
everything.
It's all pretty weird out there.

8
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:14,543
It is very weird out there.
We were just talking about how weird it 

9
00:00:16,171 --> 00:00:17,240
is out there,
um,

10
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:18,293
before the podcast about how it just 
seems like it's very difficult to keep 

11
00:00:22,091 --> 00:00:27,091
it together during these times and to 
keep a reasonable position and to handle

12
00:00:27,751 --> 00:00:28,584
all of the pressure of all the people 
that get upset at anything you do left 

13
00:00:32,521 --> 00:00:33,354
or right in the middle.
Centrist your two centers due to left 

14
00:00:36,481 --> 00:00:39,510
you to write your unreasonable.
You're to reasonable.

15
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,370
You're too nice.
You're not nice enough.

16
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:42,803
Well,
suddenly I feel like I'm in a marriage 

17
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:50,130
doesn't seem like it does.
I think that this is why this is the era

18
00:00:50,131 --> 00:00:51,240
for disagree ability.

19
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:56,270
If you're not easily swayed because 
you're somehow a insensitive enough that

20
00:00:57,421 --> 00:00:58,254
you just want to keep to first 
principles wherever it is that you 

21
00:01:01,351 --> 00:01:02,184
believe.
That seems to be the best hedge against 

22
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,360
getting swept up in the madness of 
others.

23
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:07,980
How so?
Well,

24
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:09,573
um,
I guess when I go metacognitive I look 

25
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:17,330
at my yearning for group belonging and 
then I also watch my inability to belong

26
00:01:17,551 --> 00:01:20,460
to groups that say crazy things.
And so those are,

27
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,370
those are two conflicting feelings.
I think sometimes when people look at me

28
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:23,911
they say,
wow,

29
00:01:23,911 --> 00:01:24,744
you're really contrarian and you have an
easy time standing up to the 

30
00:01:28,681 --> 00:01:30,300
conventional wisdom.
And I don't think it's,

31
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:31,620
it's,
it's that true.

32
00:01:31,621 --> 00:01:35,340
I just think when those two things fight
inside me,

33
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:36,283
a dialectically the disagree ability is 
so strong because it's protecting a 

34
00:01:40,921 --> 00:01:41,754
comprehensive view of the world.
And so since everything already kind of 

35
00:01:45,121 --> 00:01:48,690
fits together fairly well,
I would say I'm much,

36
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:49,663
it's much harder to sway me because the 
number of things I would have to move 

37
00:01:52,471 --> 00:01:54,960
cognitively to accommodate a wrong idea.

38
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,710
This is quite large.
It seems unnecessary,

39
00:01:58,711 --> 00:01:59,544
but it also seems like we should be able
to disagree on things and you should be 

40
00:02:03,481 --> 00:02:04,314
able to point out with reasonable 
courtesy that there's something wrong 

41
00:02:09,691 --> 00:02:13,260
with someone's idea and it not become a 
big personal thing.

42
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,840
But oftentimes that's not the case.
Well.

43
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,370
So a lot of the things I think that 
we're,

44
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:21,900
we're exploring or what I would think of
as Heuristics,

45
00:02:21,901 --> 00:02:25,890
they're sort of rules of thumb that 
worked fairly well within some domain of

46
00:02:25,891 --> 00:02:30,360
definition and we've gotten so many of 
these conflicting rules.

47
00:02:30,361 --> 00:02:32,400
I mean the rules of thumb themselves,
conflict.

48
00:02:32,401 --> 00:02:33,730
So for example,
he who has the,

49
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,580
his last,
uh,

50
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:37,200
conflicts with,
um,

51
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,930
nothing ventured,
nothing gained or something like that.

52
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,400
Uh,
sorry.

53
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,760
Um,
it's a,

54
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:46,503
I forget know there's the cautionary.
I'm aphorism and then there's the be 

55
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:52,410
bold,
the aphorism.

56
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:57,240
And so we don't have a good way of 
sorting out conflicts that occurred.

57
00:02:57,241 --> 00:03:00,490
The heuristic level.
Then you also have heuristics

58
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:04,240
meant for social cohesion,
conflicting with ground truth.

59
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:05,103
So this is why biology is always 
controversial because biology is a 

60
00:03:08,891 --> 00:03:12,250
science that tells us many of the things
that we wish were true or just not true.

61
00:03:12,251 --> 00:03:13,084
You know,
I always think about Ben Shapiro's 

62
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:15,670
facts.
Don't care about your feelings.

63
00:03:15,671 --> 00:03:17,600
Well,
biology cares about your feelings.

64
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,420
Just laughs at them and stomps on them 
and makes them feel very sad.

65
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:24,310
Well,
it also tries to explain your feelings,

66
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:25,840
right?
Exactly.

67
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:28,420
But you know,
if you really understand biology,

68
00:03:28,421 --> 00:03:29,254
the world is so dark and so interesting 
and beautiful and crazy that it's very 

69
00:03:33,941 --> 00:03:34,774
hard to recover simple ideas about how 
people should be once you really 

70
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:41,410
realized that are being apes has deep 
consequences.

71
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,513
Yeah.
I have a very minimal understanding of 

72
00:03:43,721 --> 00:03:46,300
biology.
But in that understanding,

73
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,433
I've come to accept some things just 
about being a person that I never 

74
00:03:51,131 --> 00:03:51,964
considered before such as all the 
different things that are running your 

75
00:03:55,421 --> 00:03:58,130
decision making,
like just what we're talking about.

76
00:03:58,130 --> 00:03:58,963
Like the,
the need to be in a group and all of 

77
00:04:01,471 --> 00:04:06,471
these are probably evolutionary 
advantages to fostering tribal behavior.

78
00:04:07,181 --> 00:04:08,920
So you could all work together and feed 
each other.

79
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:09,970
You know,
this,

80
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:12,160
this is always pulling at you and you 
know,

81
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:13,263
when,
when people give people hard time about 

82
00:04:14,891 --> 00:04:17,020
virtue signaling,
it is kind of gross.

83
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:18,790
When someone virtue signals,
you know,

84
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:21,910
but we understand what it is.
It's gross because we've all done it.

85
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:24,100
Right?
That's one of the gross things about it.

86
00:04:24,101 --> 00:04:28,000
When someone is just like really trying 
hard to act like,

87
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:28,913
you know,
they're disgusted by the way people 

88
00:04:30,671 --> 00:04:31,504
behave because they would never behave 
like that and they just want to let you 

89
00:04:33,401 --> 00:04:33,901
know,
I'm,

90
00:04:33,901 --> 00:04:34,734
I'm above this type of behavior.
What's most likely because they weren't 

91
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:38,913
above that kind of behavior at some 
point in their life or they're not 

92
00:04:41,261 --> 00:04:43,480
currently really above that type of 
behavior,

93
00:04:43,481 --> 00:04:44,314
but they wish they were or the part of 
them that speaking is the part that's 

94
00:04:46,841 --> 00:04:47,800
above that behavior.

95
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,633
But that's not the part that's going to 
be operative after 11 on a weekend at a 

96
00:04:52,001 --> 00:04:52,870
bar.
Yeah.

97
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,260
Three shots in all bets are off.
The wheels are off the wagon.

98
00:04:56,261 --> 00:04:58,360
So I think we don't,
we don't see ourselves.

99
00:04:58,390 --> 00:04:59,223
We are permanently in our own blind spot
because the part of us that is just and 

100
00:05:03,701 --> 00:05:05,750
righteous and good,
um,

101
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:08,440
seems to know very little about the 
other part.

102
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:09,693
What's also this thing,
this need to belong and need to be 

103
00:05:12,101 --> 00:05:12,934
accepted.
Like we work to be accepted instead of 

104
00:05:16,301 --> 00:05:17,134
work to be someone that you would want 
to be a part of the group instead of 

105
00:05:20,681 --> 00:05:25,330
being like really honest about who you 
are and how you think and how you behave

106
00:05:25,331 --> 00:05:26,164
and how you operate in the world.
Instead of doing that and trying to 

107
00:05:27,881 --> 00:05:31,990
improve upon that.
You try to project an image of this.

108
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:34,090
Well then here's a question for us.

109
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:38,400
Why is vice signaling so much more 
powerful than virtue signaling?

110
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:41,290
Vice signaling.
Like a person who admits their problems,

111
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:43,990
like an alcoholic who steps up and says,
I've got a real issue.

112
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:44,863
Could be that way.
Or it could be sort of Dan Bilzerian 

113
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:49,420
type vibe.
Like you want to know what I'm into.

114
00:05:49,421 --> 00:05:50,254
I'm into hot chicks weed and guns and 
I'm making tons of money and showing it 

115
00:05:54,251 --> 00:05:54,881
off.
Well,

116
00:05:54,881 --> 00:05:57,650
he's super honest right now.
That's one of the reasons.

117
00:05:57,651 --> 00:06:00,800
And you he's bulletproof in that regard.
Like you can't fuck with him.

118
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:01,940
Like you can't say,
hey,

119
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:03,710
look at you.
You're just a playboy.

120
00:06:03,711 --> 00:06:04,544
He'd be like,
yeah,

121
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:05,990
yeah.
Like girls.

122
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:06,800
Yeah,
it works.

123
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,580
Yeah.
Um,

124
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:10,040
what else?
Right now I'm nice,

125
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:12,200
like he's a nice guy.
Talked to Dan Bilzerian.

126
00:06:12,201 --> 00:06:14,090
He's friendly,
he's not bad guy.

127
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:14,701
No,
I mean he,

128
00:06:14,701 --> 00:06:15,071
he,
you know,

129
00:06:15,071 --> 00:06:17,000
he had a,
he had this post which was a,

130
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:20,650
he was I think offering a hand to a 
woman up the stair and said,

131
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,000
come with me.
I'll ruin your life,

132
00:06:22,001 --> 00:06:23,490
but it'll be fun.
No,

133
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:24,383
it was just like,
it's so disarming and I think that this 

134
00:06:27,281 --> 00:06:28,900
is also partially,
you know,

135
00:06:28,901 --> 00:06:32,740
a secret to your success,
which is that you're a nice guy.

136
00:06:32,741 --> 00:06:35,100
You're really into fighting,
you know,

137
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:36,580
you,
you hunt elk,

138
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:39,550
you're clear about which ones you're 
going to kill,

139
00:06:39,551 --> 00:06:41,770
which ones you want based on the 
reproductive cycle.

140
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:42,843
You're,
you're promoting all sorts of things 

141
00:06:44,051 --> 00:06:47,140
that people don't want to talk about to 
a fairly conscious level.

142
00:06:47,141 --> 00:06:47,974
And it's produced an incredible level of
trust in an era where all of the virtue 

143
00:06:52,241 --> 00:06:54,050
signaling gives way.
I mean,

144
00:06:54,051 --> 00:06:57,880
I mean if you scratch any person a 
enough below the surface,

145
00:06:57,910 --> 00:07:01,840
you're going to see that they're really 
warning you about themselves.

146
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:06,870
And so the people who are the most sort 
of self critical,

147
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:08,290
and this is like,
you know,

148
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:12,580
I think I brought this up recently a on 
twitter about Metta honesty,

149
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,310
where there was a in the Castro in San 
Francisco,

150
00:07:15,311 --> 00:07:16,144
there was a bar and restaurant that was 
advertising a free food naked servers 

151
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:25,130
plus false advertising.
You know,

152
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:27,400
it was just fun and playful.
And as a result,

153
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:28,241
uh,
you know,

154
00:07:28,241 --> 00:07:31,390
you had an instant desire to,
to eat there and to trust them.

155
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:34,930
And so I think that in this world of 
virtue signaling,

156
00:07:34,931 --> 00:07:35,764
vice signaling is really the growth 
industry and that's what's working for 

157
00:07:39,461 --> 00:07:43,420
good people because they are more in 
touch and you know,

158
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,553
they are going to lie to you and they're
going to do all the self interested 

159
00:07:46,661 --> 00:07:48,370
things,
but they're not going to

160
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:50,620
surprise you quite as much.
Well,

161
00:07:50,621 --> 00:07:51,454
in the case of Dan Bilzerian,
I really don't think he's going to lie 

162
00:07:52,751 --> 00:07:54,970
to you.
I don't think that's what he's doing.

163
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,080
I think what he's doing is living like a
guy who's got $100,

164
00:07:58,081 --> 00:07:58,914
million dollars and happens to be 35 
years old and likes to bang hot chicks 

165
00:08:03,161 --> 00:08:07,360
and fly around in private jets and live 
in some fucking house that he's got.

166
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,940
He just bought some crazy house and like
Bel Air,

167
00:08:09,941 --> 00:08:13,180
I guess with that weed money Jesus,
he's got.

168
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,580
It looks like you'd probably cost 
$100,000,000

169
00:08:15,581 --> 00:08:18,250
or something ridiculous like that.
It's a fucking insane house,

170
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:20,950
but that's what he likes.
The guy drives,

171
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:25,660
likes to drive around Ferrari's and d,
but he's a nice guy,

172
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:26,530
so it's like,
well,

173
00:08:26,531 --> 00:08:27,101
what,
where?

174
00:08:27,101 --> 00:08:27,934
What's what's wrong with this picture?
What's wrong with this picture is he's 

175
00:08:29,921 --> 00:08:32,260
doing things that I look at this.
This is this house.

176
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:36,610
What in the holy fuck is that?
Does he have a golf course on his roof?

177
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,700
What is that?
This is a fucking ridiculous house.

178
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:42,510
Look at this fucking place.
He gives his address out,

179
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,950
so that is address.
It's pretty hard to hide that thing.

180
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:47,950
Why the fuck would he give his address?
Alex?

181
00:08:47,951 --> 00:08:49,310
I don't think you can get there.
It's in Bel Air.

182
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:50,740
Whoa.
Look at this house.

183
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,420
It's preposterous.
Anyway,

184
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,120
this is what he likes,
but why is that bad?

185
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:55,561
I mean,
look,

186
00:08:55,561 --> 00:08:56,130
we only have

187
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:58,020
100 years.
If everything goes perfect.

188
00:08:58,021 --> 00:08:59,340
I know.
What do you give a shit?

189
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,800
Like why does everybody get a ship?
But they do give a shit.

190
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:04,910
They give a shit a lot because for a lot
of folks that are working,

191
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,390
you know,
making a good living,

192
00:09:06,391 --> 00:09:08,100
making 50 grand a year,
whatever.

193
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:08,890
That's it

194
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:09,723
completely out of the realm of 
possibility and his lifestyle wouldn't 

195
00:09:11,981 --> 00:09:15,130
be sustainable for them.
I mean because he's taking real risks.

196
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:16,053
There's no question about it.
When you get everybody stoned and then 

197
00:09:18,671 --> 00:09:21,700
you take them to fire automatic weapons 
out in the desert.

198
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:22,810
Oh yeah.
That's real risk.

199
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:25,840
And also the gambling,
he does a lot of like crazy gambling.

200
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:26,733
Well,
but this is the thing about the 

201
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,313
relationship with the unforgiving.
This is partially why I think your UFC 

202
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:36,220
and Jujitsu life is that when you have a
relationship with the unforgiving,

203
00:09:36,221 --> 00:09:37,360
you can say,
you know that guy,

204
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:38,800
that guy doesn't really know what he's 
doing,

205
00:09:38,801 --> 00:09:40,570
but then you're,
you're in the ring,

206
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:42,580
you know,
you're the man in the arena and you find

207
00:09:42,581 --> 00:09:45,160
out very quickly whether or not the 
trash talking,

208
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:47,110
you know,
paid off or it didn't.

209
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:51,460
And I think that many people have no 
relationship with the unforgiving.

210
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:54,640
Like they'll take them out on a hike 
into the,

211
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:57,820
let's say the Trinity Wilderness,
and then two hours.

212
00:09:57,821 --> 00:09:59,920
Then they'll just sit down and say,
I want to go home.

213
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:00,980
Right?
You're thinking like,

214
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:04,210
okay,
you're signaling something,

215
00:10:04,211 --> 00:10:06,290
but there's,
there's no car service and there's,

216
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:08,570
we're not calling a helicopter.
You know,

217
00:10:08,571 --> 00:10:11,560
it just that there's this.
If you live in the social layer,

218
00:10:11,561 --> 00:10:14,140
you're surprised by the existence of the
unforgiving.

219
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,920
But oh well,

220
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:22,040
one on one hand,
I want to support people's ability to do

221
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:24,140
whatever the fuck they want.
On one hand,

222
00:10:24,141 --> 00:10:24,974
I want to support someone's ability to 
sit in front of a computer and whether 

223
00:10:28,491 --> 00:10:32,450
you're working or you're writing code or
you're writing a script or you're just a

224
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:33,523
fucking playing video games,
I want to support your ability to do 

225
00:10:36,321 --> 00:10:37,520
whatever you want to do.
If you.

226
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:39,470
If you have the means,
if you're not,

227
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:41,330
you know,
if your family is starving,

228
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:43,430
this is what you enjoy doing.
Why do I care?

229
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:49,270
But as a person who's experienced a fair
amount of adversity,

230
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:52,220
especially selfimposed adversity,
I would,

231
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:54,980
I would tell you that you would benefit 
from it.

232
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:58,160
I've benefited from it and I think you'd
benefit from it too.

233
00:10:58,161 --> 00:11:00,830
You don't want to be that guy.
The two hours into the hike says,

234
00:11:00,831 --> 00:11:01,550
I want to go home.

235
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:03,290
You don't want to be that guy.
You want to be.

236
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:04,520
That person just says,
well,

237
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:05,383
this is what we're doing and I'm going 
to figure out how to do this and I'm 

238
00:11:08,391 --> 00:11:09,224
going to show character and I'm gonna.
I'm going to be proud of myself at the 

239
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,213
end of this.
I mean not might have to walk for six 

240
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:14,714
hours and when it's all over,
my legs might be shaky and I might have 

241
00:11:17,271 --> 00:11:18,104
to sit down,
but that gatorade is going to taste so 

242
00:11:19,671 --> 00:11:20,504
good.
It's going to be like the greatest 

243
00:11:21,651 --> 00:11:23,880
gatorade of all time because he's going 
to drink and you'd be like,

244
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,850
oh,
or are in the shit out of this.

245
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:27,103
You're going to feel it.
And I think we learned about ourselves 

246
00:11:29,541 --> 00:11:31,520
through especially self.
Well,

247
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:32,920
any kind of adversity,
you know,

248
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:34,183
look,
I'm coming off of being evacuated from 

249
00:11:35,481 --> 00:11:39,470
the fires,
which was for me not that difficult.

250
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:41,180
You know,
I'm not poor.

251
00:11:41,181 --> 00:11:43,370
I got a hotel,
I brought my family to the hotel.

252
00:11:43,371 --> 00:11:45,960
We got safe,
got my dog to the,

253
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,350
to the podcast studio.
And everybody's all right,

254
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:51,170
you know.
But for those firefighters,

255
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,240
I mean 12 hour shifts.
The blaze

256
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,440
for people who lost their homes,
some of them tried to save it.

257
00:11:56,441 --> 00:11:57,274
There was a story about a guy in Malibu,
the climbed on top of his roof with a 

258
00:11:59,051 --> 00:11:59,884
hose and tried to fight off the fire and
he got severe burns and he's in the 

259
00:12:02,651 --> 00:12:04,020
hospital.
And I mean,

260
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:09,030
it's raining ash and these chunks of 
fucking fire on people,

261
00:12:10,061 --> 00:12:10,894
these embers,
they're falling from the sky and this 

262
00:12:12,581 --> 00:12:14,350
guy's trying to save his house.
I mean,

263
00:12:14,351 --> 00:12:16,990
that guy literally went through the 
fires.

264
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:19,510
He'll be a different person after this 
and no question.

265
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:22,600
We've been in something of a reality 
drought.

266
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:27,660
The number of people who have very 
little relationship to reality.

267
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,440
I mean,
you know,

268
00:12:29,441 --> 00:12:31,410
I used to live in Cambridge,
Massachusetts and you'd,

269
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:32,613
you'd come in from Boston and there 
would be the science at fresh killed 

270
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:38,380
chicken bones about it,
man.

271
00:12:38,381 --> 00:12:39,400
Fresh killed chicken.

272
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:43,510
But like chicken mcnuggets,
nobody quite knows what,

273
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:45,490
what part of the chicken isn't mcnugget 
right?

274
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:47,730
It's just some abstraction that comes to
you.

275
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:52,090
And so I think we've gotten very 
divorced.

276
00:12:52,091 --> 00:12:55,210
There'll all of these layers of 
indirection between us and the world.

277
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:59,110
And when a fire happens,
it's so overwhelming.

278
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:02,250
We were just choking on the SF smoke,
uh,

279
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,810
in the bay area.
There's,

280
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:05,550
it,
it,

281
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:06,383
it just,
it gets real after having been unreal 

282
00:13:08,411 --> 00:13:09,920
for a very long time.
Yeah,

283
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:12,160
it's unavoidable.
It makes you,

284
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:15,120
it makes you buck up like you gotta get 
Outta there.

285
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:17,680
Like we got evacuated Thursday at 2:30
in the morning.

286
00:13:17,681 --> 00:13:18,850
We were looking up.
We were like,

287
00:13:18,851 --> 00:13:19,684
we gotta get the Fuck Outta here.
I don't give a shit what you leave 

288
00:13:22,631 --> 00:13:25,690
behind.
Just go keep your body and go everything

289
00:13:25,691 --> 00:13:26,524
else.
It's either replaceable or you don't 

290
00:13:27,521 --> 00:13:28,480
really need it that much.

291
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,190
Anyway.
Just fucking get out of there.

292
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:31,383
And when you see that fire raging over 
those hills and helicopters dropping 

293
00:13:34,271 --> 00:13:38,050
water on it and then another house 
explodes because the gas line gets hit.

294
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:40,150
It's just you,
you saw that,

295
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:41,620
you see that you go,
oh,

296
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:44,170
there's not enough people in the world 
to save you.

297
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,810
There's not enough fucking firefighters 
or cops.

298
00:13:46,811 --> 00:13:47,644
There's too many houses as too many 
people and a bunch of these houses are 

299
00:13:50,081 --> 00:13:51,760
going to go.
You've got to get the fuck out of there.

300
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:54,190
And um,
but there's a certain.

301
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:56,223
I was with a bunch of my friends from my
neighborhood and my friend Tom Segura 

302
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,113
and his wife,
we all stayed at the same hotel and we 

303
00:14:03,101 --> 00:14:03,934
felt we.
There was like a tangible sense of 

304
00:14:06,431 --> 00:14:09,370
community with this.
I love this point.

305
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:14,140
Let's imagine you go for a wedding and 
they house you with your third cousins.

306
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:14,973
People you barely know.
If you're lucky enough that the sewage 

307
00:14:17,831 --> 00:14:21,490
system breaks and like stuff is leaking 
out of the ceiling and you guys all have

308
00:14:21,491 --> 00:14:23,650
to do heroic,
crazy stuff to save the house.

309
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,340
You're going to be closer to your third 
cousin than you are to your uncle.

310
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:31,150
Right?
And this is this very strange feature of

311
00:14:31,151 --> 00:14:31,984
the world that is kind of a random 
arrival of diversity is very often what 

312
00:14:36,761 --> 00:14:39,040
bonds you to some particular human 
being.

313
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:44,050
And if you avoid adversity in groups 
your whole life,

314
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:45,603
you probably don't realize that a,
you're never fully activated as a human 

315
00:14:51,381 --> 00:14:52,400
being or particularly,

316
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:53,740
you know,
if,

317
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:54,693
if men I think don't form groups that in
some sense fight or battle or contest 

318
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:00,793
together.
So there's this very weird fact that 

319
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:07,001
apparently humans are the only species 
that organize a contests in teams.

320
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:10,100
Um,
you know,

321
00:15:10,101 --> 00:15:14,390
this is an intrinsic feature of being 
human contests.

322
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:16,910
Do other animals have any contests?
Well,

323
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:19,190
just so they spiked chimps,
you know,

324
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:20,053
we'll,
we'll have these incredible raiding 

325
00:15:21,441 --> 00:15:24,170
parties were very methodical and 
they'll,

326
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:27,020
they'll attack somebody else,
but I don't think that they practice it.

327
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:28,123
It's like,
okay,

328
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,160
your red team,
chimp,

329
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:30,733
chimp,
what were the only ones that do stuff 

330
00:15:32,751 --> 00:15:34,670
like that that can communicate,
right?

331
00:15:34,671 --> 00:15:37,250
Like dolphins can communicate,
but they don't do stuff like that.

332
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:39,530
Right?
Or you have individual sparring,

333
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,110
like you'll have two bears learning to 
play with each other,

334
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:43,533
um,
because it's safer to play with your 

335
00:15:45,711 --> 00:15:46,544
brother and childhood than it is to just
suddenly show up against some big ass 

336
00:15:49,701 --> 00:15:51,770
bear and have to compete for females.

337
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,633
I had William von Hippel on a couple of 
days ago and he's the author of the 

338
00:15:55,731 --> 00:15:59,180
social leap and uh,
we were actually talking about this,

339
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,073
about one of the things that made human 
being successful as we came down from 

340
00:16:03,621 --> 00:16:04,454
the trees and started walking around the
grasslands is our ability to organize 

341
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:11,510
and to work and coordinate together.
Yeah.

342
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:14,300
Well,
you know,

343
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,433
like African wild dogs are fairly good 
at this and you watch what they do in 

344
00:16:19,161 --> 00:16:19,994
their spare time very often.
They just take the piss out of each 

345
00:16:21,471 --> 00:16:26,000
other so that they actually come to each
other's age eight at a very high level,

346
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,040
uh,
in times of need.

347
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:29,143
But like,
you know,

348
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:31,560
when you're just hanging out around the 
fire hose firehouse,

349
00:16:31,561 --> 00:16:32,394
you're,
you're really just giving each other 

350
00:16:32,781 --> 00:16:33,614
shit all the time.
And so there's something about the way 

351
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:40,790
in which we play.
I'm being kind of divergent from the way

352
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:44,710
in which we behave when we actually just
need each other and like,

353
00:16:44,711 --> 00:16:46,460
you,
you need to be on that line,

354
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:47,901
you know,
let's say,

355
00:16:47,901 --> 00:16:48,590
uh,
you know,

356
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:51,560
throwing burlap bags and I just need you
to do that thing.

357
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,480
And we were both facing something 
together.

358
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:54,900
Uh,
it does not.

359
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:58,130
It doesn't have to be fighting in a 
militaristic situation.

360
00:16:58,131 --> 00:16:59,750
But I do think that,
um,

361
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,353
this is one of the weird things that's 
going on with all of this emphasis on 

362
00:17:05,061 --> 00:17:05,894
care and feelings,
is that often men need to give each 

363
00:17:09,231 --> 00:17:12,590
other shit in order to form very deep 
bonds.

364
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:13,833
If I can't tease you and if I don't know
where the line is like there is this 

365
00:17:17,721 --> 00:17:19,040
line which is like,
dude,

366
00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:19,874
that was way too far.
We all know that those lines exist and 

367
00:17:22,581 --> 00:17:25,430
we sometimes have to go up to them and 
sometimes we have to experiment by going

368
00:17:25,431 --> 00:17:26,960
over them,
but if somebody says,

369
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:28,363
I don't like the way you're talking,
it seems very insensitive and my 

370
00:17:30,921 --> 00:17:31,850
response is,
well,

371
00:17:31,851 --> 00:17:34,580
you're going to keep me from forming a 
deep bond with that person.

372
00:17:34,581 --> 00:17:36,800
You just don't know that that's how we 
do it.

373
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:38,690
Yeah.
They're shielding their.

374
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:39,643
They're putting up their shield and 
often is to project a certain image to 

375
00:17:45,111 --> 00:17:46,240
you.
They,

376
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:46,970
they,
they,

377
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:49,530
they want to be taken seriously.
They want some respect.

378
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:50,010
They

379
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:54,240
can't deal with you goofing on them.
That's true and goofing can go wrong,

380
00:17:54,241 --> 00:17:55,074
but yeah,
but I think that one of the things that 

381
00:17:57,091 --> 00:18:00,390
I've been fascinated by is where did all
this madness come from?

382
00:18:00,391 --> 00:18:01,224
And I increasingly am wondering whether 
it comes from social and emotional 

383
00:18:04,051 --> 00:18:07,530
learning that started to be taught in 
schools around emotional intelligence.

384
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:11,910
So this whole idea of eat q I think had 
a lot to it,

385
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:17,180
but not all the bugs were worked out 
because a lot of things that kind of are

386
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:21,990
in the neighborhood of bullying might be
actually intimacy building.

387
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:23,573
Right?
And so if something turns into some 

388
00:18:24,541 --> 00:18:27,060
super disgusting,
deadly hazing ritual,

389
00:18:27,061 --> 00:18:28,860
we all say,
what the hell are you people doing?

390
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,353
But on the other hand,
if it's sort of three clicks back from 

391
00:18:33,091 --> 00:18:34,740
that line and it's,
you know,

392
00:18:34,741 --> 00:18:38,370
there was mild discomfort.
We humiliate each other a little bit and

393
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,600
now we're friends for life.

394
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:42,260
Um,
then you know,

395
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:43,103
the fear of the hazing ritual gone wrong
may actually stop people from ever 

396
00:18:46,861 --> 00:18:49,950
actually making the really deep bonds to
last a lifetime.

397
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,630
Well,
isn't that like everything else?

398
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:54,930
Some people are good at things and some 
people suck at it.

399
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:56,043
So some people are good at being silly 
with their friends and some people go 

400
00:18:58,681 --> 00:18:59,514
too far.
I mean,

401
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:01,020
you,
you experienced that.

402
00:19:01,021 --> 00:19:01,854
Like I've had friends who experienced 
that where they do a podcast on the 

403
00:19:05,671 --> 00:19:07,380
podcast,
they fuck with each other,

404
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:09,990
right?
And they'll have someone come up to them

405
00:19:09,991 --> 00:19:10,824
that they don't even know right off the 
street and immediately say something 

406
00:19:12,931 --> 00:19:14,670
like,
ruthlessly insulting to them.

407
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:16,260
And I like,
what the fuck?

408
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:17,281
And uh,
yeah man,

409
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:18,750
you do that shit on your podcast all the
time.

410
00:19:18,751 --> 00:19:19,171
It's like,
okay,

411
00:19:19,171 --> 00:19:20,880
you're doing it wrong.
I don't know you.

412
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:21,923
We're not friends.

413
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:22,823
We're not bonding here.
You're walking up and saying something 

414
00:19:24,631 --> 00:19:26,840
mean calling someone about Fatso.
Exactly.

415
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:29,010
Yeah.
It's just not good at it.

416
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:30,173
And oftentimes that's a,
some sort of a sign of social 

417
00:19:33,091 --> 00:19:35,340
intelligence,
a lack of social intelligence,

418
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,140
a lack of.
I mean,

419
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:38,003
who knows what's going on in their home 
that might just be bad information from 

420
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,473
parents and they're growing up in this 
environment of a very low level social 

421
00:19:46,741 --> 00:19:50,460
skills.
And now what we're doing is,

422
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:52,290
I mean,
I think that you're spot on,

423
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:57,480
we're now going to try to readjust 
everyone around our weakest players.

424
00:19:57,690 --> 00:20:01,110
Right?
So now the idea is that because that can

425
00:20:01,111 --> 00:20:01,944
be said in a horrible way,
we're not going to let anyone say 

426
00:20:04,141 --> 00:20:06,730
anything remotely adjacent to it.
Yeah.

427
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:09,060
You can't do anything that would be a 
precursor to it.

428
00:20:09,061 --> 00:20:10,500
So you're just going to say,
well,

429
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:12,930
you see that little patch of bad cells 
over there,

430
00:20:12,931 --> 00:20:15,180
we're going to cut off your leg,
uh,

431
00:20:15,181 --> 00:20:16,600
in order to stop that cancer.

432
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:17,463
It's just like,
couldn't we do something a little bit 

433
00:20:18,421 --> 00:20:19,830
more surgical?
Well,

434
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,990
and also there's some things that 
you're,

435
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:23,813
there's a reason why we have this 
instinct to mock things because people 

436
00:20:26,581 --> 00:20:30,540
get out of La and then they demand too 
much goddamn attention and they become a

437
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:32,130
problem.
And this is a,

438
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:33,143
I think,
I believe this goes back to hunting 

439
00:20:34,651 --> 00:20:35,484
parties and hunter gatherers were the 
one person who just wanted too much 

440
00:20:38,131 --> 00:20:38,831
attention.
Like you,

441
00:20:38,831 --> 00:20:40,680
you're fucking it up for this group 
effort.

442
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:41,753
And that's Kinda what happened socially 
when people claim these very ridiculous 

443
00:20:45,751 --> 00:20:47,470
victim statuses,
you know.

444
00:20:47,471 --> 00:20:48,010
And there was

445
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:51,640
a picture that I put up on my instagram 
a couple of weeks ago of this guy.

446
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:56,940
He had this crazy makeup on and he had 
this ridiculous description of himself,

447
00:20:57,221 --> 00:21:02,221
like non binary queer that also 
identifies as a Muslim.

448
00:21:02,321 --> 00:21:04,840
And he was talking about quantum physics
and quantum physics.

449
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:09,220
Got helped him appreciate his queerness 
and I looked at that.

450
00:21:09,221 --> 00:21:10,000
I said,
okay,

451
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:10,833
maybe,
or maybe you're just fucking crying out 

452
00:21:12,341 --> 00:21:15,940
for attention,
and all I wrote was a makes sense,

453
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:20,470
definitely doesn't seem crazy and people
got mad at me for that.

454
00:21:20,471 --> 00:21:22,150
For something so obvious.
I looked.

455
00:21:22,151 --> 00:21:24,310
I just peered into the fucking deep 
dungeon.

456
00:21:24,311 --> 00:21:25,144
That is the comment section for a moment
and I saw people like you would think 

457
00:21:27,851 --> 00:21:30,160
that the people that are most 
susceptible to suicide,

458
00:21:30,161 --> 00:21:30,994
you would leave them alone,
but you're cruelty is you know you're 

459
00:21:33,221 --> 00:21:34,870
exposing your cruel to like,
listen,

460
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:38,170
that's silly.
That guy needs better friends.

461
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:41,440
Your friends are you going to tell you 
you're silly.

462
00:21:41,441 --> 00:21:43,180
You got crazy makeup.
Have you seen Scott?

463
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:47,080
You have a photo.
Look at this British Iraqi gay,

464
00:21:47,081 --> 00:21:50,210
non binary and also identify as Muslim.
Listen,

465
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:53,000
you need too much goddamn attention.
That's all I'm saying.

466
00:21:53,001 --> 00:21:55,010
I'm not saying you're a bad person.
You should kill yourself.

467
00:21:55,011 --> 00:21:57,560
You shouldn't be queer.
Be whatever you want to be,

468
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:58,573
but if you're going that hard,
that hard to define yourself like that 

469
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:05,240
is needy as shit.
That's fucking annoying.

470
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:05,460
Your

471
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:06,293
point,
your point is that you have to titrate 

472
00:22:07,601 --> 00:22:09,400
the negative feedback,
right,

473
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:11,890
so what you did was you gave them a 
small dose and say,

474
00:22:11,891 --> 00:22:12,724
look,
you might want to course correct a 

475
00:22:14,711 --> 00:22:15,544
little bit,
but the idea that there's any course 

476
00:22:17,411 --> 00:22:19,720
correction that you're not sitting there
celebrating this.

477
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:21,130
Right.
Well,

478
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:22,720
that's.
That's the thing.

479
00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:23,261
Yeah.
Yeah.

480
00:22:23,261 --> 00:22:24,094
You're supposed to celebrate it.
I'm supposed to celebrate so many 

481
00:22:25,931 --> 00:22:26,764
things.
Yeah.

482
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:27,850
Well,
you know what?

483
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,770
You can celebrate it.
That's okay,

484
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,080
but you shouldn't get mad if I go,
oh,

485
00:22:32,081 --> 00:22:35,290
that might be a little nuts because it's
obvious little nuts.

486
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,780
It's a little nuts to paint your face 
with glitter.

487
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:39,910
It's a little nuts.
It's a little nuts.

488
00:22:39,911 --> 00:22:43,270
If that was just a regular person who's 
like,

489
00:22:43,271 --> 00:22:44,620
hi,
I work at JC Penney.

490
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:48,100
My name is Wendy and this is what I like
to wear on my face.

491
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:48,850
Like,
okay,

492
00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:50,110
Wendy's a crazy bitch.

493
00:22:50,290 --> 00:22:51,790
Look at Wendy.
Go look at Wendy.

494
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:52,960
Look at her face.
What is she doing?

495
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:53,823
I don't know,
man.

496
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:55,770
She got fucking crazy glitter and our 
hairs.

497
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:59,320
15 different colors a little bit.
Okay.

498
00:22:59,321 --> 00:23:00,154
Let's look at it this way.
I have this weird thing which sometimes 

499
00:23:03,371 --> 00:23:07,120
is called Makilah phobia,
the fear of cosmetics.

500
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:08,410
Really?
Oh Man.

501
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:09,813
Lips.
What?

502
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:12,080
Con?
Like smoking,

503
00:23:12,410 --> 00:23:14,620
smoking.
No.

504
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:15,663
Fake eyelashes.
Well,

505
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:16,513
is the thing is,
is that sometimes they look somewhat 

506
00:23:18,071 --> 00:23:22,270
normal and then suddenly it doesn't 
integrate and the person just looks like

507
00:23:22,271 --> 00:23:24,190
they've got crazy stuff stuck to their 
head.

508
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:26,710
Like you've got crazy stuff's stuck to 
you.

509
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:28,240
Well,
that's how I perceive it.

510
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:33,450
Now here's the question.
I can't be in touch like they can't be.

511
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:35,440
Eric's got a problem with Makilah 
phobia.

512
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:37,990
Never heard that word.
It's freaking me out.

513
00:23:38,170 --> 00:23:40,600
It has to be a phobia that it has to be.

514
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,180
Eric can't accept people who wear 
makeup.

515
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:46,160
And my question would be from first 
principles,

516
00:23:46,161 --> 00:23:47,960
how do you tell who to have sympathy 
with?

517
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:50,060
Because this has been somewhat 
debilitating for me.

518
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:50,961
Really?
Yeah,

519
00:23:50,961 --> 00:23:52,700
sure.
So it's been a real issue,

520
00:23:52,701 --> 00:23:54,830
like you've struggled with.
It struck.

521
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:55,873
We have.
You struggled with the feeling or 

522
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:59,740
struggle with the fact that you have 
that everybody actually experienced,

523
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:01,300
if you remember Tammy,
Faye Bakker,

524
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:02,683
right?
So she was famous for freaking people 

525
00:24:04,311 --> 00:24:09,311
out because she had no concept of how 
much a hangup is too much,

526
00:24:09,771 --> 00:24:10,604
is too much.
Now what if somebody looks normal and 

527
00:24:13,581 --> 00:24:14,414
then you turn around and suddenly there,
Tammy Faye Bakker and you never can 

528
00:24:17,121 --> 00:24:17,954
predict when that's going to happen.
So that's an interesting question about 

529
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,500
do we accept the person who.
I don't know why I have this,

530
00:24:24,501 --> 00:24:27,110
it's just that some thing in my mind.
Well,

531
00:24:27,111 --> 00:24:27,944
because you're a logical person and 
you're looking at this war paint that 

532
00:24:32,331 --> 00:24:36,020
people are putting on and you don't 
understand the desire to do this,

533
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:36,913
but I do understand you do,
but you don't understand actually doing 

534
00:24:39,021 --> 00:24:39,170
it.

535
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:40,003
I don't understand why it looks normal.
Like I have the feeling that other 

536
00:24:45,321 --> 00:24:46,154
people,
it looks very different than the way it 

537
00:24:47,031 --> 00:24:48,040
looks to me.
Right?

538
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:49,460
Well,
they've just accepted it.

539
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:53,000
Maybe sometimes I accepted and then 
suddenly,

540
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:54,141
you know,
I shake it.

541
00:24:54,141 --> 00:24:55,820
It's like you're shaking out of the 
movie,

542
00:24:56,110 --> 00:24:59,600
like you see a movie where the suddenly 
the Mike is visible from the top,

543
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:01,990
uh,
what's going on here?

544
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:04,700
It's a movie,
it's a movie and and that,

545
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:08,750
but anyway,
we all have these weird quirks.

546
00:25:08,751 --> 00:25:13,751
The question is with whom should we be 
sympathetic and with whom do we do?

547
00:25:14,631 --> 00:25:15,081
We say,
well,

548
00:25:15,081 --> 00:25:15,914
you're being judgmental with me.
It's a women's shoes that have gigantic 

549
00:25:20,121 --> 00:25:20,954
heals.
Those stilettos that they could barely 

550
00:25:22,041 --> 00:25:24,080
walk in.
That one freaks me out.

551
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:26,630
It freaks me out because I see women 
walking in.

552
00:25:26,631 --> 00:25:27,464
I'm like,
this is so crazy that this is a choice 

553
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:30,973
that you are.

554
00:25:31,010 --> 00:25:33,620
I mean,
I can't imagine I'm paranoid.

555
00:25:33,621 --> 00:25:36,020
I guess maybe I've seen too much 
physical conflict.

556
00:25:36,021 --> 00:25:36,854
I can't imagine wearing something that 
would physically compromised me to the 

557
00:25:39,501 --> 00:25:40,334
point where I literally can't run away 
because you can't run away and those 

558
00:25:42,471 --> 00:25:44,510
things,
and if you're in like stilettos,

559
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:45,463
like these little things that you walk 
around in and your feet are all smushed 

560
00:25:47,991 --> 00:25:48,824
in your.
You're basically doing tiptoes 

561
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:53,270
everywhere you go and you fuck.
You have to be killing you by the end of

562
00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:53,651
the night.
Right?

563
00:25:53,651 --> 00:25:55,340
Right.
You're not running away.

564
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:58,910
This is a wolf chasing you or some shit.
If there's something going down,

565
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:00,470
you're not.
You're not getting away.

566
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:02,420
It's just,
it's a weird,

567
00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:03,643
like the desire to lengthen your legs 
and to give this graceful appearance 

568
00:26:08,091 --> 00:26:08,924
called Lordosis behavior.
Large doses or doses learning so much 

569
00:26:11,961 --> 00:26:12,794
today.
So high heels were originally developed 

570
00:26:15,201 --> 00:26:17,780
for men to appear taller.

571
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:21,050
I'm not sure if it was too pure,
taller only,

572
00:26:21,051 --> 00:26:23,320
or if it was for writing.
I can't remember.

573
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:26,300
Maybe for a lot of people don't know.
Cowboy boots.

574
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:27,373
The reason why they slip on like that is
when the horse box and takes off your 

575
00:26:31,611 --> 00:26:34,220
boots fall off.
They're supposed to.

576
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,480
I didn't know that.
Yeah,

577
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:36,343
that's the whole idea behind the reason 
you slip on and slip off and they have 

578
00:26:39,141 --> 00:26:43,190
that heel is that wouldn't heal that 
he'll slips into the stirrups.

579
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:47,850
So when you get when the Horse Bucks,
you don't want to get dragged on.

580
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:51,590
You wanted that shit that just fly off 
and then you're on your back going,

581
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:52,463
Oh look at that horse go and then you go
pick up your boots because they've 

582
00:26:54,241 --> 00:26:56,640
fallen off.
The fucking horse is gone,

583
00:26:56,641 --> 00:26:57,990
but at least you're alive.
Oh,

584
00:26:58,050 --> 00:27:00,420
that's the expression.
He died with his boots if you.

585
00:27:00,421 --> 00:27:01,080
Yeah,
if you get.

586
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:01,681
Well,
not really,

587
00:27:01,681 --> 00:27:03,600
I think that's like a gunfight type 
deal,

588
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:05,670
but I think if you get dry,
I mean if you get dragged,

589
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,530
horses are gonna,
run over rocks and shit,

590
00:27:07,531 --> 00:27:10,080
you're done.
People die all the time that are wearing

591
00:27:10,081 --> 00:27:14,610
regular shoes that shoved their feet in 
the stirrups and then you're stuck.

592
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:16,950
That's why cowboy boots come off like 
that.

593
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:18,750
Yeah.
I remember when I used to ride horses,

594
00:27:18,751 --> 00:27:19,584
we'd have the guy leading the trail 
would like take us up to a gallop and 

595
00:27:22,621 --> 00:27:25,260
suddenly say emergency dismount.
It was really terrifying.

596
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,380
Yeah.
And you know,

597
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:29,910
you'd have to do it at speed very,
very quickly.

598
00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:30,923
But I think that high heels got taken 
over by women because a lot of the 

599
00:27:35,641 --> 00:27:38,130
things that we claim that we like about 
heels,

600
00:27:38,131 --> 00:27:39,550
that is the,
uh,

601
00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:41,340
I do it for height,
uh,

602
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:42,203
like the way it makes the leg look at 
probably secondary to the curvature of 

603
00:27:46,981 --> 00:27:47,814
the back and the way in which that is 
typically a associate associated with 

604
00:27:52,890 --> 00:27:57,330
sexual receptivity.
So it's that particular posture that the

605
00:27:57,331 --> 00:27:58,164
heel keynotes.
And so the way I read it is that the 

606
00:28:00,421 --> 00:28:03,240
cost of the heel is part of the 
communication.

607
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,433
In other words,
I'm willing to do something that is 

608
00:28:05,611 --> 00:28:08,910
clearly not comfortable or for my 
benefit in any other way.

609
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:10,283
So much so that you can tell that I must
be interested in sending a signal 100 

610
00:28:14,161 --> 00:28:14,800
percent.
Yeah.

611
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:15,633
So,
so the.

612
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,820
Well,
but you have to deny the signal to.

613
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:20,400
So part of the signaling is to say,
Oh,

614
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:22,320
these are actually my most comfortable 
shoes.

615
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,840
They always say that girls are 
hilarious.

616
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:28,020
They're so comfortable.
These are so comfortable.

617
00:28:28,050 --> 00:28:30,030
Right?
Like how is that even possible?

618
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:31,500
Those aren't crocs.
Yes.

619
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:32,190
But,
but,

620
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:36,690
but the deception has to be part of.
Now I'm like,

621
00:28:36,691 --> 00:28:37,524
picturing

622
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:42,240
that was really weird.
Well,

623
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:44,490
the deception has to be.
You have to,

624
00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:47,640
you have to decide that you're not 
ridiculous.

625
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,070
Shared deception.
Yes.

626
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:52,500
Because as the guy,
I have to say,

627
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:53,520
oh,
that's so interesting.

628
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,170
Yeah.
But that's a lie.

629
00:28:55,370 --> 00:28:56,041
Well,
we're all lying,

630
00:28:56,041 --> 00:28:57,840
but it's mutually understood is a lie.
Yeah.

631
00:28:57,841 --> 00:29:02,841
But when the girls are,
girls could say these are so comfortable

632
00:29:02,851 --> 00:29:03,684
because they're not killing them because
they've accepted a higher level of pain 

633
00:29:07,531 --> 00:29:08,364
tolerance with footwear than men have.
Like if I had a just jam my feet into 

634
00:29:13,410 --> 00:29:15,300
something pointy.
Like some point.

635
00:29:15,301 --> 00:29:17,820
Yes,
Spanish dancer type shoes.

636
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:20,340
It would hurt after awhile you ever wear
a tie?

637
00:29:20,850 --> 00:29:21,683
I hate those things.
So that's some kind of uncomfortable 

638
00:29:25,381 --> 00:29:27,790
thing that we do to ourselves as men.
Well,

639
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:29,760
I used to have to wear one when I drove 
limos.

640
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:30,953
I think.
Well I've definitely worn one since 

641
00:29:32,851 --> 00:29:33,930
then,
but very rarely,

642
00:29:33,931 --> 00:29:36,120
very rarely can kill you pretty easily 
with a tie.

643
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:40,430
Like if someone has a tie on and I grab 
a hold their Thai boy,

644
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,550
unless you're a lot bigger than me,
I might kill you.

645
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:46,750
Got a hold of your tie ties.
A hard thing to shake loose.

646
00:29:46,751 --> 00:29:51,040
It's really strong like you could you.
A good tie is not going to rip.

647
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:55,960
Someone gets a hold of your tie at the 
not just twists and holds onto you.

648
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:58,060
All they have to do is hold onto you,
grab an arm,

649
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:01,180
and just grab,
wrap their legs around you and hold onto

650
00:30:01,181 --> 00:30:02,710
that ty.
You're a dead man.

651
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:04,000
Your debt.
You're.

652
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:06,880
You're giving them a weapon.
Heal you all the time.

653
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:08,590
All right,
you've convinced me no more ties.

654
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:12,250
I just grabbed that and just look and 
twist.

655
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:13,960
You don't have much time,
men,

656
00:30:13,961 --> 00:30:15,970
you,
you don't have much time to get this arm

657
00:30:15,971 --> 00:30:17,730
off.
Your such a UFC.

658
00:30:17,730 --> 00:30:19,780
Have to figure out.
It's a Jujitsu spin.

659
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:20,501
[inaudible],
UFC.

660
00:30:20,501 --> 00:30:21,334
You don't wear clothes,
but to be able to grab a hold of 

661
00:30:23,801 --> 00:30:27,670
someone's clothing like like a person 
with a leather jacket.

662
00:30:27,671 --> 00:30:29,830
If you're talking shit and you have a 
leather jacket on,

663
00:30:29,831 --> 00:30:32,980
you're with a guy who knows judo.
You are beyond fucked.

664
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:34,023
You don't do this.
This guy might as well have cannons 

665
00:30:35,981 --> 00:30:38,350
coming out of his body like you're.
You're doomed.

666
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:39,303
You're 100 percent doom.
He's going to grab that leather jacket 

667
00:30:41,231 --> 00:30:42,064
and basically this handles and he's 
gonna throw you up in the air and he's 

668
00:30:44,951 --> 00:30:49,140
going to hit you with the world.
The whole world is below it.

669
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:49,983
He's going to drive you into the world 
and you're so fucked and you don't even 

670
00:30:53,531 --> 00:30:56,290
realize it.
Joe,

671
00:30:56,291 --> 00:30:58,360
how often do you end up in fistfights?
Never.

672
00:30:59,100 --> 00:30:59,933
Never,
man.

673
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:00,833
I don't know.
I don't want to have nothing to do with 

674
00:31:01,721 --> 00:31:02,290
that.

675
00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:03,123
I just get away.
I would never want to get into 

676
00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:05,543
fistfights.
This is fascinating to me about this 

677
00:31:07,721 --> 00:31:08,554
sort of the world here.
It's always talking about fighting and 

678
00:31:10,751 --> 00:31:13,060
what can happen,
but just in in our world,

679
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:17,050
there's like almost none of this in,
you know,

680
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:20,260
relatively boring white guy,
middle age.

681
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:23,560
You ever go on Worldstar hip hop,
that Shit's all day everyday.

682
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:28,680
There's plenty of videos you most,
most of the time nothing happens,

683
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:30,663
but the one time when Shit does happen,
if you don't know how to defend 

684
00:31:34,121 --> 00:31:36,070
yourself,
you're really fucked.

685
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:37,690
This is.
This is true,

686
00:31:37,691 --> 00:31:38,524
but then the thing is,
is that in all the practicing that you 

687
00:31:40,571 --> 00:31:41,404
do,
you're also exposing yourself to the 

688
00:31:42,371 --> 00:31:44,440
potential for injury.
Oh yeah.

689
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:46,810
So there's a question as to whether 
you're safer.

690
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:51,580
If you spend all of your time in this 
kind of,

691
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:52,960
well,
what if something happens?

692
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:53,793
I want to be prepared,
but the preparation for it is itself 

693
00:31:55,751 --> 00:31:58,300
potentially fairly hazardous.
That's unquestionable,

694
00:31:58,301 --> 00:31:59,134
but isn't that just like the guy who 
sits on the couch and never goes into 

695
00:32:00,761 --> 00:32:02,200
the woods because he doesn't want to get
tired.

696
00:32:02,201 --> 00:32:04,780
I know it's very similar because like 
here we are,

697
00:32:04,781 --> 00:32:07,720
I'm 51 years old and um,
and it all works.

698
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:11,800
So even though I've been injured,
I'm right here.

699
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:15,040
Everything works like a.
But you also got of this shit fixed.

700
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:19,330
What if the UFC thing was like bold and 
interesting when you were a young guy,

701
00:32:19,331 --> 00:32:20,164
do you think you would have.
I would have 100 percent done it and I 

702
00:32:21,821 --> 00:32:24,940
probably would have a much harder time 
having this conversation.

703
00:32:24,941 --> 00:32:25,930
That's right.
Yeah,

704
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,550
for sure.
Yeah.

705
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:28,833
So I think you hit the sweet spot where 
you got the skills you've been in 

706
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:32,223
training idiom,
you really know what you're talking 

707
00:32:34,241 --> 00:32:35,074
about and you're getting front row seats
but not actually having to have your 

708
00:32:38,561 --> 00:32:40,340
brain particularly take the pounding.

709
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:44,180
There's no getting away from that.
And that is the unfortunate reality that

710
00:32:44,181 --> 00:32:46,700
every fighter accepts.
There's no getting away from that.

711
00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:49,310
There's,
there's an absolute possibility,

712
00:32:49,311 --> 00:32:53,420
and it's not just your head,
it's also your joints.

713
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:54,553
A big part is your back and your neck.
I know many guys that have neck 

714
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:58,333
impingements and disc herniations and 
fused neck disks and then nerve pinched 

715
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:08,180
nerves or impinged to the point where 
they have atrophy in their arms.

716
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:09,463
I know several guys who have that where 
they have one arm that's smaller than 

717
00:33:11,781 --> 00:33:12,614
the other arm and it severely impedes 
their ability to move and they used to 

718
00:33:16,371 --> 00:33:17,204
be world champions to guys that have 
been on the show bus route and Pat 

719
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:21,260
Miletich two of the greatest of all 
time.

720
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:22,393
Both guys have one small arm in one 
regular size arm because of neck 

721
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:27,283
impingements who their nerves are 
literally pinched down by all the 

722
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:33,860
swelling and scar tissue and that 
damaged discs.

723
00:33:34,370 --> 00:33:36,140
Yeah.
Well since we became friends,

724
00:33:36,141 --> 00:33:40,850
I started just casually looking at this 
world and it's utterly fascinating.

725
00:33:40,910 --> 00:33:43,010
I mean there's.
There's nothing like it.

726
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:44,990
Well,
did you Jitsu world?

727
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,960
I think you would.
There's two different worlds,

728
00:33:47,961 --> 00:33:49,850
right?
There's the MMA world which incorporates

729
00:33:49,851 --> 00:33:50,684
all the different martial arts,
and then there's the Jujitsu world and 

730
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:56,900
the Jujitsu world.
I think you would find seek out.

731
00:33:56,901 --> 00:33:59,690
Yes,
you would love it because it's basically

732
00:34:00,290 --> 00:34:05,060
to call it chest is not quite fair 
because it's more complex than chess.

733
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:07,460
There's much more going on.
Visa freedom are so high,

734
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:08,353
but it's also easier to win if someone's
better than chess because even if 

735
00:34:11,331 --> 00:34:14,090
someone is fairly competent in chess,
we'll take a few moves to beat them.

736
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:15,343
In Jujitsu,
if someone's fairly competent in the 

737
00:34:16,971 --> 00:34:19,320
other one is a master,
it probably crush your very quickly,

738
00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:20,563
but the.
When you watch two really high level 

739
00:34:22,851 --> 00:34:23,684
guys trying to set each other up,
it's this crazy rolling exercise and 

740
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:28,813
leverage and position and in the 
knowledge of moves that Eddie Bravo 

741
00:34:32,391 --> 00:34:35,930
versus a crazy crazy.

742
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,700
Yeah.
It's hard to even know what's going on.

743
00:34:37,790 --> 00:34:39,080
It's crazy.
If you don't know,

744
00:34:39,081 --> 00:34:39,914
it's one of my more difficult challenges
of being in a commentator is when the 

745
00:34:44,871 --> 00:34:48,620
fight goes to the ground explaining to 
people watching at home.

746
00:34:48,621 --> 00:34:51,560
What he wants to do right now is get his
right leg over his arm and as soon as he

747
00:34:51,561 --> 00:34:52,880
does that,
now that arm is stuck.

748
00:34:52,881 --> 00:34:54,410
He's in trouble right now,
you know,

749
00:34:54,430 --> 00:34:57,210
and like to try to explain that to 
people so they can follow along.

750
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:57,590
Go,
oh,

751
00:34:57,590 --> 00:34:58,423
I see,
I see.

752
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:00,800
And he's going to grab that.
He's arch arches back any tapped?

753
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:02,240
And people go,
oh,

754
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,193
and it gets people really excited about 
Jujitsu because they see that and you 

755
00:35:05,181 --> 00:35:05,631
go,
oh,

756
00:35:05,631 --> 00:35:08,270
this is like really complicated.
Like he's got,

757
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:10,860
there's like a dance he's doing.
The other guy's trying to resist.

758
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:11,743
But the first time I saw the gracie 
breakdown of particular fights where 

759
00:35:14,781 --> 00:35:17,030
they've committed to memory every move.

760
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:17,913
Yeah.
It's like replaying the great games of 

761
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:23,150
like morphy or Combo Banca chess and 
you're just thinking,

762
00:35:23,151 --> 00:35:23,961
wow,
that,

763
00:35:23,961 --> 00:35:25,080
okay,
there's the evergreen game,

764
00:35:25,081 --> 00:35:29,090
there's the moral game and that that to 
me is fascinating,

765
00:35:29,091 --> 00:35:29,924
but it's actually more interesting to me
in the UFC arena because of the fact 

766
00:35:34,911 --> 00:35:37,070
that that's only a component and that 
it's.

767
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:43,700
What I didn't understand was how much we
could get close to unrestricted fighting

768
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:45,383
and still have people fairly dependably 
survive with minimal obvious disfigure 

769
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:53,730
disfigurements there is disagreement.
Would there are some.

770
00:35:53,731 --> 00:35:56,610
We could even be safer if we eliminated 
weight cutting.

771
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,670
The weight cutting is the number one 
health issue in the sport in my opinion.

772
00:36:00,671 --> 00:36:01,504
Yeah.
Number two is the brain damage and the 

773
00:36:02,791 --> 00:36:04,040
impact and the,
you know,

774
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,760
broken bones and things along those 
lines,

775
00:36:05,970 --> 00:36:08,760
but the number one is weight cutting 
because it's so unnecessary.

776
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:11,100
It's such a,
such an issue that needs to be addressed

777
00:36:11,101 --> 00:36:14,070
because these guys want to compete at 
the highest weight possible.

778
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:15,950
So do you know how it works?
No.

779
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:16,883
Okay.
Say if you were going to compete in the 

780
00:36:17,791 --> 00:36:20,630
170 pound division,
but you actually weighed one 90,

781
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:21,763
which you would do is you would wait 
until you would follow a pretty strict 

782
00:36:24,121 --> 00:36:24,954
diet,
keep your body weight in your fat a 

783
00:36:26,191 --> 00:36:27,024
certain level,
and then when it comes down to a few 

784
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:31,990
days before you would dehydrate yourself
pretty radically.

785
00:36:31,991 --> 00:36:32,824
Yeah.
And then rehydrate yourself 

786
00:36:33,751 --> 00:36:34,584
scientifically using the.
There's a bunch of guys like George 

787
00:36:37,590 --> 00:36:38,423
Lockhart guys who are experts in this 
and then they'll give you the exact 

788
00:36:40,441 --> 00:36:41,274
right amount of nutrients right around 
of potassium and zinc and they want to 

789
00:36:43,290 --> 00:36:46,440
replenish all of your electrolytes and 
get you in a perfect balance,

790
00:36:46,441 --> 00:36:47,274
but you're still compromised and if you 
don't have a guy like a George Lockhart 

791
00:36:50,761 --> 00:36:51,594
or someone who's a real expert in 
nutrition and understands biology and 

792
00:36:54,301 --> 00:36:55,134
can get you back into that position,
you're most likely gonna compete 

793
00:36:57,481 --> 00:36:58,314
compromised,
but you're going to accept that 

794
00:36:59,730 --> 00:37:00,563
significant compromising because you're 
going to be a bigger person than the 

795
00:37:03,481 --> 00:37:05,490
person you're fighting,
but they also,

796
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:06,493
like in boxing in particular,
the vast majority of deaths have 

797
00:37:09,871 --> 00:37:10,704
occurred in the lighter weight divisions
and a lot of it is not just because of 

798
00:37:13,381 --> 00:37:14,214
the head trauma,
but because it's head trauma to someone 

799
00:37:15,661 --> 00:37:16,494
who's dehydrated.

800
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:17,700
That's interesting.
Yeah.

801
00:37:17,701 --> 00:37:18,630
It's like it's.
It's.

802
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:22,530
It sucks and it's contrary to what 
martial arts is supposed to be about.

803
00:37:22,770 --> 00:37:24,480
Martial arts supposed to be about skill 
for skill.

804
00:37:24,481 --> 00:37:25,314
It's not supposed to be about cheating 
and that cheating thing is like you're 

805
00:37:28,051 --> 00:37:30,510
dehydrating yourself.
It's like sanctioned cheating.

806
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:33,680
You're saying you're 170 pounds if 
you're like,

807
00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:34,523
if you say this,
the 170 pound champion and get on the 

808
00:37:36,631 --> 00:37:38,580
scale is one 93.
What the fuck's going on?

809
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:41,640
This isn't a 170 pounds.
Now frustrating if I want to meet you in

810
00:37:41,641 --> 00:37:43,920
a different class like I wanted to fight
you my whole life,

811
00:37:43,950 --> 00:37:45,660
but we're really separated.
Well,

812
00:37:45,661 --> 00:37:47,760
you can lose weight the right way.
Look,

813
00:37:47,761 --> 00:37:50,130
if somebody wants to compete at 170 
pounds,

814
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:53,550
in my humble opinion,
they should actually weighed 170 pounds.

815
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:54,773
My friend Cam Haynes is a ultra marathon
runner and one of the things that he 

816
00:37:58,591 --> 00:38:01,730
does when he gets ready for ultra 
marathons is he loses bodyweight,

817
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,330
but he doesn't have any body weight to 
lose.

818
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:04,343
So he'll.
He'll burn 300 calories and eat 2000 

819
00:38:07,141 --> 00:38:07,974
calories and that's how he loses weight.
He lets his body eat itself so he gets 

820
00:38:11,461 --> 00:38:14,700
down to the sixties and that's when he 
runs these gigantic long races,

821
00:38:14,701 --> 00:38:18,120
like 240 miles.
But I know he's done this.

822
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:20,940
You can do this like you don't have to 
dehydrate yourself,

823
00:38:20,941 --> 00:38:24,270
but they choose to dehydrate themselves 
because they replenish and then they get

824
00:38:24,271 --> 00:38:25,890
much bigger when they get inside the 
octagon.

825
00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:28,560
When he's 65,
he's actually one 65.

826
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:32,220
That's just what he weighs and that's 
the best way to run 240 miles,

827
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,113
so he does it through discipline,
but these guys that are it and it's not 

828
00:38:36,101 --> 00:38:38,290
their fault because it's already been 
established.

829
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,273
It's a part of the sport.
It's been there for years and years and 

830
00:38:40,930 --> 00:38:41,763
years and it's.
It's sanctioned cheating and everybody 

831
00:38:43,751 --> 00:38:44,584
does it and it's the worst part of the 
sport because it's really damaging to 

832
00:38:48,371 --> 00:38:50,470
your kidneys,
terrible for your organs.

833
00:38:50,690 --> 00:38:51,523
Your body starts to shut down when you 
do it too often and your body doesn't 

834
00:38:54,221 --> 00:38:55,054
want to lose weight anymore,
so it starts to really hold onto that 

835
00:38:57,431 --> 00:39:01,450
water and guys fall asleep and pass out 
and bang their heads off.

836
00:39:01,451 --> 00:39:02,284
Walls and fights get canceled like pro 
championship level flights get canceled 

837
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:09,300
because guys blackout and crack their 
head off the wall and this is.

838
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:11,230
This has happened in the in the UFC 
before.

839
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:12,483
It's just super,
super unnecessary and unfortunate and 

840
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:18,850
part of it is because there's not enough
weight classes.

841
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:20,640
There's like,
you know,

842
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:22,900
there's 1:55,
then there's one 70.

843
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:26,470
The difference from 1:55
and one 70 is not just 15 pounds because

844
00:39:26,471 --> 00:39:30,610
if you actually weigh 1:55
and this guys dropping down to one 70,

845
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:31,743
that motherfucker could be one 90 plus 
and he's just figuring out a way to cut 

846
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:38,350
weight to get down to there and that 
happens all the time.

847
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:40,060
So you're,
you're dealing with,

848
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:41,650
you know,
it could be 25,

849
00:39:41,651 --> 00:39:43,800
30 pounds difference between you two 
guys if you're,

850
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:47,260
if you actually way with the weight 
classes when you get into the octagon,

851
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:50,320
so people are forced to drop weight,
they're forced to go lower.

852
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:52,510
If they want to compete at a world class
level,

853
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:56,920
they're forced to take this extra risk 
and it could be mitigated.

854
00:39:56,921 --> 00:39:57,754
It could,
it could all be stopped by hydration 

855
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:02,440
test.
The UFC could step in.

856
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:04,870
All the athletic commissions could step 
in and say,

857
00:40:04,871 --> 00:40:06,670
enough is enough.
You're going to fight it,

858
00:40:06,671 --> 00:40:07,504
what your way and we're going to give 
you more weight classes so you could 

859
00:40:09,701 --> 00:40:10,534
figure out what's the wait for you to be
best at and I hope it doesn't take 

860
00:40:13,931 --> 00:40:14,764
someone dying before they figured this 
out because it's one of those things 

861
00:40:18,011 --> 00:40:20,110
that people have done like circumcision.

862
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:22,090
They've done it forever so they just 
keep doing it,

863
00:40:22,270 --> 00:40:23,860
but if they just started doing it 
tomorrow,

864
00:40:23,861 --> 00:40:25,960
people are like,
why did you cut that baby's Dick?

865
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:28,120
Are you fucking crazy?
Well,

866
00:40:28,121 --> 00:40:29,340
I've always cut babies,
ticks.

867
00:40:29,350 --> 00:40:30,880
I've been cutting babies.
Dick's for years.

868
00:40:31,270 --> 00:40:34,540
Like this is right.
It's like a yiddish get used to it.

869
00:40:34,541 --> 00:40:36,310
Well,
it's not just yiddish mean I'm Catholic.

870
00:40:36,311 --> 00:40:37,144
My Dick are cut.
It's like practiced across the board 

871
00:40:40,841 --> 00:40:45,841
under the guise of being sanitary.
It's prevention of AIDS.

872
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:48,360
All these stupid reasons to cut dicks 
like it.

873
00:40:48,361 --> 00:40:49,194
Really,
it's just a tradition that doesn't make 

874
00:40:50,201 --> 00:40:51,430
any goddamn sense.
Now.

875
00:40:51,431 --> 00:40:53,200
It's not the best analogy to weight 
cutting

876
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:59,020
the cutting dicks.
I do want to pick up on an analogy which

877
00:40:59,021 --> 00:40:59,854
I'm curious about.
So when you're trying to describe the 

878
00:41:01,811 --> 00:41:03,240
ground game,
yeah,

879
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:04,953
it's super tough for a lay audience 
because the picture doesn't necessarily 

880
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:09,424
match what you're seeing because the 
layer of expertise makes a bunch of 

881
00:41:12,671 --> 00:41:17,020
random arm movements and head movements 
and hip movements into something else.

882
00:41:17,590 --> 00:41:18,423
We have the same problem in like math 
and physics where everybody wants to 

883
00:41:21,221 --> 00:41:25,870
know what's going on with that thing.
And then when you have been listening to

884
00:41:25,871 --> 00:41:26,704
like the physicists on your program,
I don't think you have many 

885
00:41:28,271 --> 00:41:29,104
mathematicians,
but it's so confusing to figure out how 

886
00:41:34,131 --> 00:41:36,230
to talk to the world about things that 
people,

887
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:37,093
everybody wants to know about.
And I was just curious as if you saw a 

888
00:41:40,281 --> 00:41:41,630
parallel,
uh,

889
00:41:41,631 --> 00:41:44,570
in those two things.
Those are certainly very high art forms.

890
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:45,970
Yeah.
I'm.

891
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:49,460
Sean Carroll has done a really good job 
of trying to explain things.

892
00:41:49,461 --> 00:41:51,770
Neil degrasse Tyson's done a really good
job trying to explain things.

893
00:41:52,070 --> 00:41:53,170
I saw,
um,

894
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:58,250
the explanation of gauge symmetry 
Lawrence Krauss on your show,

895
00:41:58,310 --> 00:41:59,143
which is like from two to my way of 
thinking when the most important 

896
00:42:01,821 --> 00:42:02,654
principles in the world.
I still have no idea what the fuck he 

897
00:42:04,431 --> 00:42:05,910
said exactly.
Well like,

898
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:07,910
well I read his book.
Yeah.

899
00:42:07,970 --> 00:42:10,520
And after I read his book,
that was the number one question I had.

900
00:42:10,521 --> 00:42:11,354
I said,
okay,

901
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:13,970
I need you to explain to me what is 
gates symmetry?

902
00:42:13,971 --> 00:42:16,670
What does that mean?
It's so weird that he didn't.

903
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:19,430
I don't think he expected you to just 
bust it out.

904
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:21,230
Yeah,
I don't think so either.

905
00:42:21,231 --> 00:42:26,150
That's it,
but I think that it's so hard to like,

906
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:27,400
okay,
here's one of my.

907
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:28,590
I will get back together.

908
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:32,210
Symmetry maybe.
But like when people say the universe is

909
00:42:32,211 --> 00:42:33,340
expanding,
right?

910
00:42:33,650 --> 00:42:36,440
What the fuck does that mean?
Every,

911
00:42:37,130 --> 00:42:41,040
every smart person says into what?
Right.

912
00:42:41,210 --> 00:42:43,040
You know,
like it's the universe.

913
00:42:43,041 --> 00:42:44,620
What is it expanding into?
Right.

914
00:42:44,870 --> 00:42:46,310
And where's it going?
Right.

915
00:42:46,370 --> 00:42:47,203
And it,
it doesn't make any sense because the 

916
00:42:49,130 --> 00:42:51,470
linguistics of the universe is 
expanding,

917
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:52,333
isn't really what the what.
So you're saying the matter in the 

918
00:42:54,081 --> 00:42:57,140
universe is moving outwards,
is that what the universe is expanding?

919
00:42:57,530 --> 00:42:58,363
What it means is I'm,
the infinite universe is getting more 

920
00:43:01,341 --> 00:43:03,000
infant her.
No.

921
00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:06,170
So first of all was that they.
Did you say that?

922
00:43:06,290 --> 00:43:07,123
Yeah,
I was trying to be silly to sativa is 

923
00:43:11,161 --> 00:43:12,050
kicking in.
Yeah.

924
00:43:12,130 --> 00:43:14,540
Um,
so if you think about this bottle,

925
00:43:14,830 --> 00:43:15,663
right,
it's the slices of the bottle that are 

926
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:21,073
expanding,
but if you think of the bottle is the 

927
00:43:22,641 --> 00:43:24,890
universe the bought the bottle isn't 
expanding.

928
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:29,180
It's just the cross sections that are 
expanding.

929
00:43:29,750 --> 00:43:30,583
And so that's what they really mean.
What they really mean is something like 

930
00:43:32,511 --> 00:43:36,430
the spacetime metric on space,
like cross sections has a,

931
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:39,530
it's volume for them when integrated is 
higher or something like that.

932
00:43:39,990 --> 00:43:41,900
Some,
some mathematical statement,

933
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:45,830
but the universe is expanding is not 
helpful to me.

934
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:50,360
Like if I wasn't able to read the math,
I would say I don't get it.

935
00:43:50,850 --> 00:43:53,690
Well,
I don't get anything quite honestly.

936
00:43:53,710 --> 00:43:56,450
I'm not being self deprecating.
I don't get the Big Bang.

937
00:43:56,610 --> 00:43:58,240
Yeah.
I don't get it at all.

938
00:43:58,241 --> 00:43:58,550
Well,
okay.

939
00:43:58,550 --> 00:44:00,500
Here's what somebody should tell you.
Okay.

940
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:01,673
Um,
there are two kinds of singularity's 

941
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:08,480
when you try to solve Einstein's field 
equations for gravity.

942
00:44:08,481 --> 00:44:11,630
So gravity as a thing,
Einstein tells us pretty much,

943
00:44:12,170 --> 00:44:13,003
uh,
what we think gravity is the curvature 

944
00:44:15,381 --> 00:44:18,470
of space and time.
And when we try to solve his equations,

945
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:19,813
we get these black hole singularities 
which called swartz chilled 

946
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:23,133
singularities,
and let me get this initial singularity 

947
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:25,993
a which we associate back to the big 
bang with the freedmen Walker Robertson 

948
00:44:29,571 --> 00:44:31,100
model in some.

949
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:32,213
Those singularities are indications to 
us that we're not at the end of physics 

950
00:44:36,150 --> 00:44:38,760
and that Einstein's equations aren't,
there aren't the real story.

951
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:40,343
And so rather than sort of saying 
they're a pretty good model up until 

952
00:44:43,411 --> 00:44:45,900
this point and then we kind of really 
don't know what happened,

953
00:44:45,901 --> 00:44:46,734
then we have the observational thing 
that we would map to the big bang and 

954
00:44:49,081 --> 00:44:51,360
then we have the model thing that we 
would map to the big bang.

955
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:52,493
And to be honest with you,
I'm pretty sure that are our models 

956
00:44:54,811 --> 00:44:55,644
don't make sense past a point.
And now we're having this conversation 

957
00:44:58,110 --> 00:45:00,300
past the point where we're pretty sure 
they don't make sense.

958
00:45:00,510 --> 00:45:05,510
That would be much more honest to me,
but because we have this desire to,

959
00:45:06,810 --> 00:45:10,050
um,
to blow people's minds gratuitously,

960
00:45:10,540 --> 00:45:13,650
um,
and everybody wants to.

961
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:15,540
How did everything begin and where are 
we?

962
00:45:15,610 --> 00:45:16,443
Who are we in?
We want to sort of answer more of that 

963
00:45:19,651 --> 00:45:20,760
than we probably should.

964
00:45:21,750 --> 00:45:24,060
Hmm.
That's an interesting way.

965
00:45:25,170 --> 00:45:26,003
That makes sense.
Let me give you an alternate spin on 

966
00:45:27,931 --> 00:45:29,670
quantum mechanics.
Okay.

967
00:45:30,510 --> 00:45:32,610
So typically people will say,
you know,

968
00:45:32,611 --> 00:45:37,290
the mind blowing thing about quantum 
mechanics is that it's probabilistic and

969
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:40,920
that is kind of mind blowing,
but if you actually say it differently,

970
00:45:41,070 --> 00:45:41,903
you say,
look in classical mechanics like newton 

971
00:45:44,730 --> 00:45:46,650
stuff that we feel more comfortable 
with,

972
00:45:47,310 --> 00:45:49,290
you have good questions and bad 
questions.

973
00:45:49,291 --> 00:45:52,320
Like if you and I go hang out at the 
beach and I say to you,

974
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:56,790
hey,
where's that wave concentrated?

975
00:45:56,791 --> 00:46:00,990
At what point does that with wave live?
You look at me and say it's a wave.

976
00:46:00,991 --> 00:46:04,260
It's not concentrated at a point.
It's all along the shore.

977
00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:09,270
So as a classical physicists you to say 
that's not a good question,

978
00:46:09,271 --> 00:46:13,260
Eric,
and when I asked you a good question,

979
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:14,213
like how fast is that wave front,
moving along this trajectory of 

980
00:46:18,301 --> 00:46:19,134
something,
you can give me an answer and it's 

981
00:46:19,711 --> 00:46:20,544
definite.

982
00:46:20,850 --> 00:46:23,700
So as long as you ask a good question.
In classical mechanics,

983
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:25,013
you get definite answers when you go to 
quantum mechanics and you ask a good 

984
00:46:27,841 --> 00:46:29,460
question.
Uh,

985
00:46:29,461 --> 00:46:33,690
technically that means that the state 
vector is an observable of the,

986
00:46:34,010 --> 00:46:36,060
her mission operator representing the 
question.

987
00:46:36,750 --> 00:46:39,540
Nevermind.
I'm funny.

988
00:46:39,541 --> 00:46:41,550
Thing happens.
You get deterministic answers.

989
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:43,650
There's no probability involved 
whatsoever.

990
00:46:44,250 --> 00:46:46,410
So if I ask a good question in quantum 
mechanics,

991
00:46:46,411 --> 00:46:47,920
I have the same property that I,
I,

992
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:48,763
I do.
When I ask a good question in classical 

993
00:46:49,951 --> 00:46:51,390
mechanics,
I get a definite answer.

994
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:52,224
There is no probability when I ask a bad
question and quantum mechanics instead 

995
00:46:57,331 --> 00:46:59,450
of like classical mechanics says,
you know,

996
00:47:00,030 --> 00:47:01,770
screw off,
I'm not answering that.

997
00:47:01,771 --> 00:47:03,450
That's ridiculous.
It's a bad question.

998
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:04,793
Quantum mechanics,
as you really want to ask me a bad 

999
00:47:05,761 --> 00:47:07,200
question.
All right,

1000
00:47:07,620 --> 00:47:08,453
I'll give you maybe this answer and 
maybe that answer and here's the 

1001
00:47:10,711 --> 00:47:11,544
probability distribution that I'll 
actually give you either of those two 

1002
00:47:13,531 --> 00:47:17,220
answers and what's more,
I'll even kick it into the state that I,

1003
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:18,510
that you asked about.

1004
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:19,793
So for example,
if you ask where is that wave 

1005
00:47:21,781 --> 00:47:22,614
concentrated?
So like let's say this is my coffee cup 

1006
00:47:25,140 --> 00:47:27,060
and I drop a little drop in the center 
of it,

1007
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:28,950
that creates a circular way that 
radiates.

1008
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:31,090
And I say,
where does the wave concentrated?

1009
00:47:31,870 --> 00:47:35,050
Well,
at one second it hits the Coffee Mug.

1010
00:47:35,051 --> 00:47:35,884
Let's say it's a big coffee cup and at 
one second after that it's concentrated 

1011
00:47:38,861 --> 00:47:39,694
again in the center.
So that becomes a good question only 

1012
00:47:42,551 --> 00:47:45,520
when the wave becomes really 
concentrated in the center of the cup.

1013
00:47:46,130 --> 00:47:48,880
Right?
But if that wave where a quantum wave,

1014
00:47:49,330 --> 00:47:53,410
I could ask where is the way of 
concentrated and with equal probability,

1015
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:54,393
suddenly the wave will concentrate at 
some point along the circle that 

1016
00:47:58,811 --> 00:47:59,710
represents the wave,

1017
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:02,830
right?
So what would your answer be then?

1018
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:06,400
What the point would be a.
it'll concentrate at one of these points

1019
00:48:06,401 --> 00:48:07,990
around the circle at random,
with equal,

1020
00:48:08,310 --> 00:48:09,143
with equal probability,
and suddenly the wave will concentrate 

1021
00:48:11,650 --> 00:48:13,150
randomly.
When I,

1022
00:48:13,210 --> 00:48:14,043
when it's a quantum question.
So this is why quantum mechanics is so 

1023
00:48:16,390 --> 00:48:17,223
confusing.
Quantum physics are so confusing to 

1024
00:48:18,521 --> 00:48:20,650
people because they hear,
they hear that and they go,

1025
00:48:20,651 --> 00:48:21,484
okay,
this is confused when in my head like 

1026
00:48:23,591 --> 00:48:24,340
Jello.
Well,

1027
00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:26,440
that's the thing,
but the point of if I,

1028
00:48:26,441 --> 00:48:27,274
if I have a wave and I slow it down,
I can look at a wave and a coffee mug 

1029
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:33,460
and I can see that if I ask where is the
wave concentrated,

1030
00:48:33,990 --> 00:48:34,823
you would say it's concentrated at like 
half an inch from the center of the cup 

1031
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:38,691
and say,
no,

1032
00:48:38,691 --> 00:48:41,440
no,
not what ring is it concentrated or what

1033
00:48:41,441 --> 00:48:44,740
exact point that concentrated in exact 
point,

1034
00:48:45,250 --> 00:48:46,083
but that wave in quantum mechanics which
is not concentrated at an exact point 

1035
00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:53,050
behaves differently.
When I ask a bad question.

1036
00:48:53,051 --> 00:48:53,884
So the,
the point that I'm trying to get across 

1037
00:48:54,881 --> 00:48:55,714
is good questions have exactly the same 
properties in classical mechanics and 

1038
00:49:00,251 --> 00:49:01,084
quantum mechanics.
There's no introduction to probability 

1039
00:49:02,531 --> 00:49:03,364
theory.
The weird question is why is quantum 

1040
00:49:05,111 --> 00:49:07,300
mechanics answering bad questions?

1041
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:10,880
Well,
or maybe even weirder question is

1042
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:18,320
not just why is quantum mechanics in an 
adolescent state of understanding?

1043
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:19,273
I mean,
it was part of the problem that they 

1044
00:49:20,661 --> 00:49:21,494
don't know enough yet and they're trying
to like explain what they do know and 

1045
00:49:25,101 --> 00:49:27,920
what they can prove on paper and for a 
person like me,

1046
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:28,833
like,
well,

1047
00:49:28,850 --> 00:49:30,350
what do you know?
And they're like,

1048
00:49:30,351 --> 00:49:31,850
well,
we know probabilities.

1049
00:49:31,851 --> 00:49:32,684
We know this,
we know that and a person like me who 

1050
00:49:34,131 --> 00:49:36,920
doesn't have any studying and it just 
goes up.

1051
00:49:37,790 --> 00:49:38,660
What does that mean?
Well that's,

1052
00:49:38,780 --> 00:49:39,613
that's great.
So like let's say we were having a 

1053
00:49:40,611 --> 00:49:41,444
conversation about genetics and we were 
looking only at the DNA and we didn't 

1054
00:49:44,241 --> 00:49:48,410
see epigenetics in terms of like 
methylation patterns.

1055
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:49,993
Then you'd,
you'd shove everything onto DNA and 

1056
00:49:52,041 --> 00:49:52,874
maybe you had no concept of like 
development and the model would work up 

1057
00:49:57,021 --> 00:49:59,750
to a point would explain why you have 
blue eyes or Brown eyes,

1058
00:49:59,751 --> 00:50:01,610
but it wouldn't explain all sorts of 
other things.

1059
00:50:01,610 --> 00:50:05,090
And so now then you over overdeveloped 
that model.

1060
00:50:05,150 --> 00:50:08,870
So I think that what you're saying is 
really Einstein's intuition,

1061
00:50:08,871 --> 00:50:11,710
which is.
I'm not saying I'm Einstein,

1062
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:14,480
I'm not saying that this is wrong.
I'm saying this is incomplete.

1063
00:50:14,510 --> 00:50:16,670
And then when we finally get the answer,
we're going to say,

1064
00:50:16,671 --> 00:50:17,504
oh,
that's why we used to think of it in 

1065
00:50:18,681 --> 00:50:22,550
those crazy terms.
So back to gauge theory,

1066
00:50:22,850 --> 00:50:25,400
gauge symmetry.
What the hell was that?

1067
00:50:25,820 --> 00:50:26,600
All right,
well,

1068
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:28,250
here's the.
Here's the craziest thing.

1069
00:50:28,330 --> 00:50:29,163
Okay.
There is a very confusing visual image 

1070
00:50:32,630 --> 00:50:33,463
of the fundamental unit that you need to
appreciate what gauge symmetry is all 

1071
00:50:37,161 --> 00:50:38,900
about.
And uh,

1072
00:50:38,901 --> 00:50:39,734
I had Jamie loaded up under the tab 
called planet hop and this is going to 

1073
00:50:45,350 --> 00:50:46,840
hop pf a h,
o,

1074
00:50:46,841 --> 00:50:47,674
p,
f,

1075
00:50:48,260 --> 00:50:49,093
what the fuck am I looking at you?
Or looking at the most important object 

1076
00:50:52,431 --> 00:50:57,020
in the universe,
what that looks like,

1077
00:50:57,021 --> 00:50:59,780
some trippy screensaver on your laptop.

1078
00:50:59,810 --> 00:51:02,030
Take another puff,
my friend because it's worth it.

1079
00:51:02,870 --> 00:51:07,870
This is what you're looking at is a 
principle fiber bundle and it's in,

1080
00:51:09,370 --> 00:51:12,020
it is the earth.
Those are the continents.

1081
00:51:12,620 --> 00:51:13,453
That's the cool part about it,
which is this is very confusing to 

1082
00:51:17,241 --> 00:51:19,550
figure out what you're looking at,
but it's finite.

1083
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:20,533
In other words,
if we stay for an hour or two on this 

1084
00:51:23,451 --> 00:51:25,130
and we actually answer all your 
questions,

1085
00:51:25,131 --> 00:51:25,964
you will actually know what a principal 
and bundle is and you will know the 

1086
00:51:28,371 --> 00:51:29,204
arena in which gauge theory exists for 
folks at home that are just listening 

1087
00:51:33,051 --> 00:51:33,884
and they were.
What the fuck are these guys talking 

1088
00:51:34,911 --> 00:51:36,320
about?
What is the name of this video?

1089
00:51:36,321 --> 00:51:38,930
Jamie video.
Not a video.

1090
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:39,913
It's a small file on a page I typed in 
planet hop and that was the first thing 

1091
00:51:43,911 --> 00:51:46,490
that showed up on math dot Toronto Dot 
Edu.

1092
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:47,960
Okay,
so extended thing.

1093
00:51:48,020 --> 00:51:52,850
Planet h o p,
F for anybody wants to look at this.

1094
00:51:52,851 --> 00:51:55,820
If you're just listening and you have no
idea why I'm freaking out.

1095
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:57,153
So this,
this was done by a friend of mine named 

1096
00:51:59,511 --> 00:52:02,330
Drawer Barn Aton.
I actually coded the same thing up.

1097
00:52:02,450 --> 00:52:04,150
Um,
strangely enough.

1098
00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:06,710
Didn't do a brilliant job of coloring 
it.

1099
00:52:07,210 --> 00:52:08,360
It looks amazing.
Motorola.

1100
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:09,793
So okay.
What's you're looking at is a two 

1101
00:52:15,261 --> 00:52:16,094
dimensional sphere that is the surface 
of the earth where an extra circle is 

1102
00:52:23,181 --> 00:52:26,780
included at every point on the surface 
of that sphere,

1103
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:31,810
which you're now visualizing,
and that extra circle,

1104
00:52:34,371 --> 00:52:37,130
which would be called the fiber,
um,

1105
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,760
when you take the totality of all of 
those circles together,

1106
00:52:40,761 --> 00:52:42,800
one for each point on the surface of the
sphere,

1107
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:44,593
they create something called a three 
sphere that is all the points that are 

1108
00:52:47,871 --> 00:52:52,370
one unit of distance away from the 
origin in four dimensional space.

1109
00:52:52,940 --> 00:52:53,773
So that three dimensional sphere is the 
analog of a two dimensional spheres 

1110
00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:00,530
sitting in three dimensional space.
So think about a caramel apple.

1111
00:53:01,100 --> 00:53:04,850
If you've ever made caramel apples,
you get a disk of Carmel and you wrap it

1112
00:53:04,851 --> 00:53:08,030
around the sphere.
That is the apical surface,

1113
00:53:08,031 --> 00:53:11,990
right?
So this is the three dimensional version

1114
00:53:11,991 --> 00:53:16,820
of Carmel wrapped around the three 
dimensional,

1115
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:20,780
a sphere sitting in four dimensional 
space.

1116
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:22,880
Now,
do you understand any of this,

1117
00:53:22,881 --> 00:53:24,680
Jamie?
I'm trying,

1118
00:53:25,370 --> 00:53:26,700
dude.
It's totally trippy,

1119
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:27,593
right?
And so we're not going to get it 

1120
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:31,350
completely during this session.
However,

1121
00:53:31,740 --> 00:53:32,573
I think I lacked the tools.
I don't think so if that we lack the 

1122
00:53:35,521 --> 00:53:36,354
time.
So the first thing is you are finding 

1123
00:53:37,771 --> 00:53:38,604
out that one of your friends thinks this
is the most important object in the 

1124
00:53:41,971 --> 00:53:43,800
universe and you've never even heard of 
it.

1125
00:53:44,370 --> 00:53:47,250
Much less know that there's one visual 
example.

1126
00:53:47,610 --> 00:53:49,050
What's a fuck?
How is this happening?

1127
00:53:49,051 --> 00:53:54,030
I know exactly.
It does look fucking crazy.

1128
00:53:54,570 --> 00:53:56,130
Well,
okay.

1129
00:53:56,520 --> 00:53:57,353
This is what was discovered in the mid 
19 seventies as the connection between 

1130
00:54:03,930 --> 00:54:04,763
mathematics and different,
what we call differential geometry and 

1131
00:54:07,950 --> 00:54:11,940
the discipline of particle theory.
So two guys,

1132
00:54:12,030 --> 00:54:13,770
uh,
Jim Simons,

1133
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:14,633
the world now,
the world's most successful hedge fund 

1134
00:54:16,171 --> 00:54:17,004
manager and cn Yang,
a person who might arguably be the 

1135
00:54:19,831 --> 00:54:20,664
world's first or second greatest living,
theoretical physicists had a lunch 

1136
00:54:24,121 --> 00:54:24,931
seminar.
And they said,

1137
00:54:24,931 --> 00:54:26,820
why don't we figure out how do we talk 
to each other?

1138
00:54:27,660 --> 00:54:28,493
And what they found out is they both had
developed a version of this picture and 

1139
00:54:32,700 --> 00:54:34,020
independently,
independently.

1140
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:38,280
So it was the Rosetta stone that 
unleashed a revolution.

1141
00:54:38,580 --> 00:54:41,910
So when Lawrence Krauss was talking to 
you about gauge theory,

1142
00:54:42,510 --> 00:54:43,343
he was saying things about chessboards 
and you color it white and you color it 

1143
00:54:46,081 --> 00:54:46,914
black.

1144
00:54:47,010 --> 00:54:47,843
Super confusing to me.
I would rather your people be confused 

1145
00:54:51,810 --> 00:54:52,643
about an actual example of the object on
which we do gauge theory that you can 

1146
00:54:56,311 --> 00:54:57,144
visually see [inaudible] right now,
if I started to tell you what gauge 

1147
00:55:01,531 --> 00:55:06,370
theory is pretty simple.
So here's the.

1148
00:55:06,450 --> 00:55:07,283
Here's the description.
I never hear anyone say when you're 

1149
00:55:09,391 --> 00:55:10,224
doing differential calculus.
I don't know if you remember 

1150
00:55:12,301 --> 00:55:13,134
differential calculus.
Trying to figure out the slopes of 

1151
00:55:15,001 --> 00:55:17,640
lines.
Instantaneous rise over the run.

1152
00:55:19,410 --> 00:55:21,480
So that always makes sense to people.
Okay.

1153
00:55:21,481 --> 00:55:24,310
I figured out how fast it's going up 
versus how fast it's going across.

1154
00:55:25,750 --> 00:55:30,540
But a question arises which is where do 
you measure the rise from?

1155
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:32,790
So for example,
if I say,

1156
00:55:33,090 --> 00:55:36,360
what is the height of Mount Everest,
Jamie?

1157
00:55:36,361 --> 00:55:39,270
We'll say 30,
30,

1158
00:55:39,330 --> 00:55:42,750
5,000,
something like that.

1159
00:55:42,780 --> 00:55:44,600
Something crazy like that.
Well,

1160
00:55:45,190 --> 00:55:47,990
let's get an internet connection,
I guess.

1161
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:48,833
What do you think it is?

1162
00:55:49,350 --> 00:55:50,183
I don't know.
I can't remember if I was to say it's 

1163
00:55:51,151 --> 00:55:53,340
$35,000.
What do you think that it was?

1164
00:55:53,341 --> 00:55:55,310
Twenty nine.
Twenty nine.

1165
00:55:55,340 --> 00:55:56,173
Oh,
two nine.

1166
00:55:57,030 --> 00:55:57,691
Okay.
What's,

1167
00:55:57,691 --> 00:55:59,580
uh,
the highest was the highest one.

1168
00:56:00,810 --> 00:56:02,970
Is it k two?
K Two is second,

1169
00:56:02,971 --> 00:56:04,820
right?
Is it has ever the highest?

1170
00:56:04,821 --> 00:56:06,030
Yeah,
but okay,

1171
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:07,680
so everest,
29.

1172
00:56:07,710 --> 00:56:09,180
Would you say 29.
Twenty nine.

1173
00:56:09,181 --> 00:56:10,014
Oh,
two nine.

1174
00:56:10,110 --> 00:56:13,890
Nine.
Above what sea level.

1175
00:56:14,790 --> 00:56:17,880
Whereas Mount Everest located the 
Himalayas.

1176
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:18,841
What does that,
what?

1177
00:56:18,841 --> 00:56:20,000
See?
Uh,

1178
00:56:20,010 --> 00:56:21,600
there's no ocean there,
right?

1179
00:56:21,690 --> 00:56:25,360
So like we snuck its above sea level and
there's no ocean.

1180
00:56:25,510 --> 00:56:27,040
So we start from the center of the 
Earth.

1181
00:56:27,190 --> 00:56:29,440
Will we have this structure called the 
joy,

1182
00:56:30,190 --> 00:56:33,520
which is the interpolation of sea level 
as if sea level is.

1183
00:56:33,521 --> 00:56:37,720
If the earth was only ocean and there 
was no tie in as if there's some sort of

1184
00:56:37,721 --> 00:56:39,430
a.
So we snuck in the reference level.

1185
00:56:39,430 --> 00:56:40,263
That's my point is,
is that we teach these kids to repeat 

1186
00:56:42,790 --> 00:56:43,623
why it's 29,000
and change above sea level and there's 

1187
00:56:45,460 --> 00:56:46,293
no C.
Right?

1188
00:56:46,900 --> 00:56:50,020
So that reference level is the magic of 
gauge theory,

1189
00:56:50,620 --> 00:56:51,453
right?
Which is that we measured the rise over 

1190
00:56:53,381 --> 00:56:58,381
the run based on a custom level,
so at a level that we all agree upon.

1191
00:56:59,590 --> 00:57:01,990
So for example,
let's imagine that you and I are in some

1192
00:57:01,991 --> 00:57:05,050
country experiencing hyperinflation,
right?

1193
00:57:05,140 --> 00:57:07,900
And I'm your boss and you say,
dude,

1194
00:57:08,170 --> 00:57:09,880
I need a raise.
I said,

1195
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:13,510
well look,
I've told you I would hire you for,

1196
00:57:13,830 --> 00:57:14,920
you know,
10,000

1197
00:57:15,130 --> 00:57:18,190
dinars a month.
And you say,

1198
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:19,810
yeah.
I said,

1199
00:57:19,811 --> 00:57:21,400
well,
your salary is constant.

1200
00:57:21,401 --> 00:57:24,100
I took the derivative of it.
I've paid you $10,000

1201
00:57:24,130 --> 00:57:25,090
last month,
10,000

1202
00:57:25,091 --> 00:57:25,924
this month.
So you're getting the same amount 

1203
00:57:27,020 --> 00:57:27,880
derivative,
equal zero.

1204
00:57:27,881 --> 00:57:28,714
It's constant salary.
Now you have to come back at me in 

1205
00:57:31,961 --> 00:57:33,940
calculus and you say,
no,

1206
00:57:33,941 --> 00:57:34,774
I don't like your notion of the 
derivative because what you're doing is 

1207
00:57:36,791 --> 00:57:40,630
you're measuring the absolute number of 
dinars that you're paying me,

1208
00:57:41,260 --> 00:57:42,093
but what I want to do is I want to 
measure it and purchasing power because 

1209
00:57:44,441 --> 00:57:47,470
I'm losing money every month that you 
don't increase my salary.

1210
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:48,873
So I now come up with a version of the 
calculus in which Mike salary is not 

1211
00:57:53,501 --> 00:57:58,360
constant because it's being measured 
relative to purchasing power rather than

1212
00:57:58,361 --> 00:57:59,194
absolute units.
That's gauge there is that you're 

1213
00:58:02,621 --> 00:58:07,621
bringing in a reference level that does 
the differentiation.

1214
00:58:07,961 --> 00:58:12,400
So you're measuring rise over run by 
customizing the problem.

1215
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:13,353
So these were two different applications
of the calculus that cheating employer 

1216
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:18,880
says,
I want to go with constant dnrs.

1217
00:58:19,540 --> 00:58:23,920
The gifted employees says not so fast.
I know gauge theory.

1218
00:58:23,921 --> 00:58:26,680
I want to use a custom reference level 
which is purchasing power,

1219
00:58:28,030 --> 00:58:28,863
right?
So it's like sneaking the geoint into 

1220
00:58:29,981 --> 00:58:33,970
Tibet to measure everest.
I've got my custom level.

1221
00:58:34,050 --> 00:58:34,990
It was.
This makes sense to you.

1222
00:58:35,290 --> 00:58:37,840
Yes,
it makes sense right now.

1223
00:58:37,841 --> 00:58:39,160
Explain it.
Say what he said.

1224
00:58:41,470 --> 00:58:43,430
We would need a new reference of what 
we're.

1225
00:58:43,530 --> 00:58:47,650
You want to measure what the new 
conversation to have like a flat level.

1226
00:58:48,250 --> 00:58:49,083
I guess it would be really difficult for
me to recall a day from now maybe we'd 

1227
00:58:55,590 --> 00:59:00,590
know we'd might have recalled that might
pop up mushroom cap.

1228
00:59:01,090 --> 00:59:02,740
See what's up.
It's.

1229
00:59:02,741 --> 00:59:06,880
I'm still in reference to quantum 
physics.

1230
00:59:06,881 --> 00:59:09,760
Like how you would use gauge symmetry?
Well,

1231
00:59:09,790 --> 00:59:10,623
but let's do it.
Let's look at some more cool stuff with 

1232
00:59:12,220 --> 00:59:13,053
the visual cortex because everything 
that we can do visually should inform 

1233
00:59:16,031 --> 00:59:16,864
what we can do linguistically.
So you should push everything into the 

1234
00:59:18,851 --> 00:59:21,500
visual realm that you can.
Uh,

1235
00:59:21,700 --> 00:59:22,800
do you mean by that?
Like,

1236
00:59:23,030 --> 00:59:24,740
well I just showed you the hop 
vibration,

1237
00:59:24,770 --> 00:59:25,603
which is the only,
in some sense the only mature picture I 

1238
00:59:30,231 --> 00:59:31,064
can show you have a principal vibration 
in geometry or physics that is honest 

1239
00:59:36,350 --> 00:59:37,183
and has the full complexity.
It's got a certain kind of nodded 

1240
00:59:39,501 --> 00:59:40,334
newness to it.
It's got something that we would call 

1241
00:59:42,321 --> 00:59:46,070
curvature and it is visualized and so

1242
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:50,500
it would be better that we spent,
you know,

1243
00:59:50,530 --> 00:59:51,363
a day or two on this most important 
object which we think reality is based 

1244
00:59:55,001 --> 00:59:58,540
around and that you visually got 
comfortable with it.

1245
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:01,000
And then you said,
okay,

1246
01:00:01,001 --> 01:00:02,860
now tell me again what gauge symmetry 
is.

1247
01:00:02,920 --> 01:00:06,490
And then instead of Lawrence talking 
about this chessboard and the colors and

1248
01:00:06,491 --> 01:00:07,960
all this stuff,
by analogy,

1249
01:00:08,260 --> 01:00:13,120
you'd actually be seeing gauge theory 
visually like I could program a computer

1250
01:00:13,150 --> 01:00:17,380
and have done so to show you visually 
what a gauge theory is.

1251
01:00:17,410 --> 01:00:18,243
And that takes some time to sort of 
understand what the trip he pictures 

1252
01:00:20,561 --> 01:00:21,394
are.
But if let's bring up the escher 

1253
01:00:21,761 --> 01:00:22,594
staircase

1254
01:00:24,820 --> 01:00:25,653
and Jamie has a nice wrinkle on this,
that instead of using MC escher 

1255
01:00:28,391 --> 01:00:29,224
staircase,
he's got this animated guy who just 

1256
01:00:31,571 --> 01:00:33,830
keeps going down.
All right,

1257
01:00:34,090 --> 01:00:34,923
now what's going on with those stairs?
Now the stairs are sort of an optical 

1258
01:00:38,771 --> 01:00:41,260
illusion because obviously it can't just
keep going down.

1259
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:43,360
But then you build these systems like 
rock,

1260
01:00:43,361 --> 01:00:44,194
paper,
scissors.

1261
01:00:44,530 --> 01:00:46,720
What's the best thing to throw in rock?
Paper scissors?

1262
01:00:47,170 --> 01:00:48,730
Well,
it depends on what you throw.

1263
01:00:49,110 --> 01:00:51,370
Well,
but we should be able to agree that rock

1264
01:00:51,371 --> 01:00:52,204
is better than scissors.
Rock has better than says this paper's 

1265
01:00:54,370 --> 01:00:56,170
better than rock,
right?

1266
01:00:56,171 --> 01:00:57,004
So you go around that thing and now the 
point is that you get to like rock as 

1267
01:00:59,351 --> 01:01:01,200
much better than rock.
Right?

1268
01:01:01,220 --> 01:01:02,053
And that seems crazy.
Now that can concept would be what we 

1269
01:01:04,511 --> 01:01:06,940
would call Holland Omi.
The weird sentence.

1270
01:01:06,941 --> 01:01:09,610
Rock is better than rock because of that
going around the loop.

1271
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:10,473
Why rock has better than rock?
I don't get it well better than 

1272
01:01:13,751 --> 01:01:15,610
scissors.
Scissors is better than paper.

1273
01:01:15,970 --> 01:01:16,803
Paper's better than rock.
So by transitivity rock is therefore 

1274
01:01:19,570 --> 01:01:22,900
better than rock because you went around
the loop and came back to rock.

1275
01:01:23,270 --> 01:01:24,310
It's like Mna.
Math.

1276
01:01:24,930 --> 01:01:25,763
Yeah.
Yeah.

1277
01:01:26,050 --> 01:01:26,883
Or if like if you're.
If you're changing a currencies and you 

1278
01:01:29,831 --> 01:01:32,890
don't spend any of it because you keep 
losing using your credit card,

1279
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:34,233
by the time you come home you had more 
money than when you left because the 

1280
01:01:37,541 --> 01:01:41,080
exchange rates did some things so that 
when you changed into each currency,

1281
01:01:41,180 --> 01:01:44,680
you somehow got richer.
But by saying rock is better than rock,

1282
01:01:44,681 --> 01:01:46,720
you're denying the fact they're exactly 
the same.

1283
01:01:47,050 --> 01:01:47,570
Well,
no,

1284
01:01:47,570 --> 01:01:48,403
not.
You're not addressing the linguistic 

1285
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:52,450
linguistic fallacy.
Right?

1286
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:53,313
So the idea that this system here,
so those stairs in engaged theory would 

1287
01:01:58,721 --> 01:02:01,530
be these reference levels for the 
derivative [inaudible].

1288
01:02:02,110 --> 01:02:02,943
And you can have situations where the 
reference levels don't knit flatly 

1289
01:02:05,651 --> 01:02:07,640
together.
Right?

1290
01:02:08,830 --> 01:02:09,663
And so by virtue of that,
we would say that the system has 

1291
01:02:12,221 --> 01:02:13,690
curvature,
curvature.

1292
01:02:13,691 --> 01:02:14,524
Is the assuredness of,
of these better than transitive 

1293
01:02:19,050 --> 01:02:20,030
statements what we're looking.

1294
01:02:20,090 --> 01:02:20,900
Yeah,
folks,

1295
01:02:20,900 --> 01:02:22,550
for people who just listening,
we're looking at,

1296
01:02:22,940 --> 01:02:25,370
if you've never seen those essure 
etches,

1297
01:02:25,430 --> 01:02:26,263
those sketches,
they're very strange because what there 

1298
01:02:27,521 --> 01:02:32,521
are is a bunch of staircases that appear
to always be going downhill,

1299
01:02:32,900 --> 01:02:34,790
even if one of them is above the other 
one.

1300
01:02:34,910 --> 01:02:36,380
It's a very strange,
very strange.

1301
01:02:36,410 --> 01:02:37,243
And this one we're watching an animated 
guy rolled down this staircase 

1302
01:02:40,130 --> 01:02:42,890
constantly,
even though it really looks like somehow

1303
01:02:42,891 --> 01:02:44,900
or another,
it must go up somewhere,

1304
01:02:45,050 --> 01:02:45,883
but you don't ever see it going up.
But it's also a factor of the illusion 

1305
01:02:49,371 --> 01:02:53,900
of perspective and how it's drawn and,
and playing games with lines.

1306
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:55,033
Exactly.
But if you do this very weird 

1307
01:02:58,431 --> 01:02:59,264
experiment,
which we didn't know about until the 

1308
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:03,050
late fifties called the aronoff Boehm 
experiment.

1309
01:03:04,460 --> 01:03:06,660
If you run,
um,

1310
01:03:07,310 --> 01:03:08,950
a,
a,

1311
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:13,640
an electric current through a wire 
that's insulated,

1312
01:03:14,180 --> 01:03:15,030
um,
it's,

1313
01:03:15,110 --> 01:03:15,943
it appears not to have any 
electromagnetic field outside of the 

1314
01:03:18,801 --> 01:03:20,210
installation.
However,

1315
01:03:20,211 --> 01:03:22,430
if you do some sort of quantum 
interference experiment,

1316
01:03:22,730 --> 01:03:23,563
you can tell that there's current going 
through because it affects the phage 

1317
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:28,280
phase shift,
let's say,

1318
01:03:28,330 --> 01:03:33,140
of an electron orbiting that insulated 
electromagnetic system.

1319
01:03:33,350 --> 01:03:37,640
So nobody thought that that was going to
happen because they thought,

1320
01:03:37,641 --> 01:03:38,900
well,
it insulator would keep.

1321
01:03:38,970 --> 01:03:39,803
We thought the electromagnetic field is 
what determines the shift in the 

1322
01:03:43,611 --> 01:03:44,444
electronic,
but it's insulated so there is no 

1323
01:03:45,291 --> 01:03:46,124
electromagnetic field to worry about.
It turned out that it wasn't the 

1324
01:03:48,261 --> 01:03:49,094
electromagnetic field alone,
it was some previous geometric concept 

1325
01:03:53,480 --> 01:03:57,020
which is called the electromagnetic 
potential that determine something about

1326
01:03:57,021 --> 01:03:57,854
the phase shift.

1327
01:03:58,220 --> 01:04:01,670
So this escher staircase in the case of 
electromagnetism,

1328
01:04:01,671 --> 01:04:04,610
it's like the photons are the analog of 
those steps.

1329
01:04:05,540 --> 01:04:08,600
They're partially would determine the 
derivative operators,

1330
01:04:08,700 --> 01:04:11,870
does reference levels and again,
in our discussion of the,

1331
01:04:12,560 --> 01:04:13,393
uh,
am I paying you the right amount and a 

1332
01:04:14,331 --> 01:04:15,164
hyper inflationary economy.
So all of these things you're trying to 

1333
01:04:18,771 --> 01:04:20,540
figure out,
well that's an optical illusion,

1334
01:04:20,541 --> 01:04:23,330
but that effect actually occurs in some 
systems,

1335
01:04:23,390 --> 01:04:25,490
not as an optical illusion.
Yes.

1336
01:04:25,670 --> 01:04:28,250
Right.
So this weirdness,

1337
01:04:29,090 --> 01:04:29,923
I'm requires a fair amount in terms of 
either study of math or learning 

1338
01:04:36,981 --> 01:04:37,814
visualizations,
but there's no way to achieve it in my 

1339
01:04:39,681 --> 01:04:42,980
experience with linguistic 
communications.

1340
01:04:43,010 --> 01:04:46,430
Like all the stuff that gets said about,
you know,

1341
01:04:46,431 --> 01:04:47,264
the universe is expanding or let me tell
you what it gauge theory is and why 

1342
01:04:51,710 --> 01:04:54,860
there's a reason it's confusing.
It's because it doesn't make any sense.

1343
01:04:56,030 --> 01:04:56,900
I see what you're saying.

1344
01:04:57,410 --> 01:04:58,550
Sort of.
But.

1345
01:04:58,640 --> 01:05:01,910
So this is,
this is like what fineman said.

1346
01:05:02,390 --> 01:05:04,100
If you think you know,
quantum physics,

1347
01:05:04,130 --> 01:05:07,140
you don't know quantum physics.
Well there's some of that like there's,

1348
01:05:07,380 --> 01:05:08,213
you know,
one of the most important things in the 

1349
01:05:09,471 --> 01:05:10,304
world is this thing called a spinner,
like the electrons and the protons 

1350
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:15,793
correspond to things called spinners.
And the average person has no idea that 

1351
01:05:18,881 --> 01:05:20,950
spinners exist.
What's more?

1352
01:05:21,670 --> 01:05:25,690
Spinners have a property that when I 
tell it to you linguistically won't make

1353
01:05:25,691 --> 01:05:27,470
any sense.
Alright,

1354
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:29,110
good.
Let's do this with coffee.

1355
01:05:29,260 --> 01:05:30,330
Hit me with it.
Okay.

1356
01:05:31,100 --> 01:05:34,240
So yeah,
thank you sir.

1357
01:05:34,300 --> 01:05:35,690
Perfect.
All right,

1358
01:05:36,120 --> 01:05:37,240
here's the problem.
Okay.

1359
01:05:37,510 --> 01:05:39,190
Hold Your Cup.
No sorry.

1360
01:05:39,340 --> 01:05:40,173
From the bottom.
And here's the first challenge without 

1361
01:05:43,031 --> 01:05:44,030
spilling it.
Okay?

1362
01:05:44,590 --> 01:05:46,750
I want you.
And without readjusting your grip on the

1363
01:05:46,751 --> 01:05:50,170
bottom of your cup,
I want you to turn your cup 360 degrees.

1364
01:05:51,030 --> 01:05:51,850
No,
no.

1365
01:05:51,850 --> 01:05:54,210
Sorry.
Turn your fingers.

1366
01:05:54,211 --> 01:05:55,044
Should not change on the cup.
Turn the cup 360 degrees without 

1367
01:05:59,621 --> 01:06:04,621
spilling it and try to take a sip.
Okay.

1368
01:06:07,090 --> 01:06:10,150
That didn't work.
Now without coming back,

1369
01:06:10,210 --> 01:06:13,030
how would you take a sip if I got it all
the way around that way?

1370
01:06:13,060 --> 01:06:15,070
Yeah.
Mr.

1371
01:06:15,370 --> 01:06:18,130
Jujitsu man would have to.

1372
01:06:18,660 --> 01:06:19,493
Wow.

1373
01:06:20,540 --> 01:06:21,720
I would have to help myself.
No,

1374
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:22,810
no,
you're going to do it.

1375
01:06:22,870 --> 01:06:23,703
Alright,
you ready?

1376
01:06:24,460 --> 01:06:25,293
Okay.
Here we go.

1377
01:06:25,830 --> 01:06:28,330
You're going to go around the circle.
Three hundred and 60.

1378
01:06:28,500 --> 01:06:29,333
Okay.
Right now I'm screwed if I don't bring 

1379
01:06:33,521 --> 01:06:35,350
it back underneath.
Oh,

1380
01:06:35,351 --> 01:06:36,184
I see.
So that system required 720 degrees of 

1381
01:06:39,431 --> 01:06:42,400
rotation unexpectedly.
You just keep going.

1382
01:06:42,430 --> 01:06:43,540
Right.
Okay.

1383
01:06:43,660 --> 01:06:44,493
Now the idea that there are objects that
don't come back to themselves under 360 

1384
01:06:50,141 --> 01:06:50,974
degrees of rotation but require seven 
slash 20 is probably something you've 

1385
01:06:53,201 --> 01:06:54,940
never thought about before in your life.
Right?

1386
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:56,433
But without that,
you wouldn't have the poly exclusion 

1387
01:06:57,851 --> 01:06:58,684
principle,
you wouldn't have the stability of 

1388
01:06:59,651 --> 01:07:00,484
matter.
And this thing is called the Philippine 

1389
01:07:02,321 --> 01:07:03,250
wind dance.
Jamie,

1390
01:07:03,251 --> 01:07:08,020
do you want to.
That's not very seductive,

1391
01:07:08,021 --> 01:07:08,854
Jeff.
It seems like some very odd ethnic 

1392
01:07:11,681 --> 01:07:12,491
dance.
Yeah.

1393
01:07:12,491 --> 01:07:14,770
But like maybe you could do 11th planet 
Jujitsu.

1394
01:07:14,920 --> 01:07:19,920
Here we go.
So this spinner is one of the coolest,

1395
01:07:24,191 --> 01:07:28,120
most important objects anywhere.
And it was discovered to be important in

1396
01:07:28,121 --> 01:07:32,340
physics by a guy named Paul Dirac.
Right?

1397
01:07:32,550 --> 01:07:34,350
It's fun.
Okay.

1398
01:07:34,351 --> 01:07:36,690
So this 720 theory

1399
01:07:38,920 --> 01:07:41,710
is entirely responsible for the world 
that we live in.

1400
01:07:41,890 --> 01:07:42,723
This is so bizarre to don't know,
but in animation and nobody knows about 

1401
01:07:45,371 --> 01:07:46,570
it,
right?

1402
01:07:46,571 --> 01:07:48,850
Like unless you're hanging out with 
physicists,

1403
01:07:49,600 --> 01:07:52,540
they don't tell you that 
electromagnetism has to do with the fact

1404
01:07:52,541 --> 01:07:56,110
that there's a secret circle at every 
point in space and time that's invisible

1405
01:07:56,111 --> 01:07:56,944
to you.
They don't tell you that there's stuff 

1406
01:07:58,451 --> 01:08:02,320
that requires 720 degrees of rotation.
They just say mindblowing stuff about,

1407
01:08:02,570 --> 01:08:03,403
whoa.
So what is happening in his 720 degrees 

1408
01:08:06,911 --> 01:08:07,744
of rotation in the quantum world?
There is an object that is requiring 

1409
01:08:12,131 --> 01:08:17,131
this just the way the cup arm system 
requires 720 degrees of is this called a

1410
01:08:17,991 --> 01:08:22,991
spinner and that spinner is how we model
the electron,

1411
01:08:23,450 --> 01:08:27,650
Neutrino corks,
all that is spin oriel matter,

1412
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:33,020
sir.
That's good.

1413
01:08:33,021 --> 01:08:36,440
Long pause and like it.
And what,

1414
01:08:36,441 --> 01:08:39,470
where does this fit in,
in our model of the universe?

1415
01:08:39,471 --> 01:08:41,870
Like what is the function of this?
Why is it there?

1416
01:08:42,290 --> 01:08:44,360
What is it,
how do we know it's there?

1417
01:08:44,910 --> 01:08:49,670
Well,
we know it's there because uh,

1418
01:08:49,730 --> 01:08:50,563
when dereck.
So there was this problem with like the 

1419
01:08:52,761 --> 01:08:53,594
Schrodinger equation.
Schrodinger equation takes one 

1420
01:08:55,401 --> 01:08:56,234
derivative in terms of the direction of 
time it takes to derivatives in the 

1421
01:09:00,471 --> 01:09:01,304
direction of all the spacial directions.
But because Einstein told us that space 

1422
01:09:04,491 --> 01:09:08,330
and time are woven together for the 
theory to be relativistic,

1423
01:09:08,570 --> 01:09:09,403
you need the same number of derivatives 
of time as of space because space time 

1424
01:09:12,591 --> 01:09:14,960
is sort of one kind of semi unified 
object.

1425
01:09:15,400 --> 01:09:16,233
All right?
That means you either have to boost the 

1426
01:09:17,931 --> 01:09:18,764
number of derivatives of time up to two 
to match the two derivatives and the 

1427
01:09:22,881 --> 01:09:23,714
directions of space where you have to 
knock the two direct derivatives in the 

1428
01:09:27,471 --> 01:09:28,304
spatial directions,
down to one derivative to get it to be 

1429
01:09:31,010 --> 01:09:31,340
equal.

1430
01:09:31,340 --> 01:09:34,070
Now one direction gets you to something 
called the client coordinate equation.

1431
01:09:34,760 --> 01:09:35,593
What Dirac did is he took a square root 
of the client Gordon equation to get 

1432
01:09:40,191 --> 01:09:41,024
these spinners.
So he had these numbers he didn't 

1433
01:09:42,981 --> 01:09:46,730
understand at first that he was going to
get kicked into this world of spinners.

1434
01:09:47,630 --> 01:09:48,463
He came up with a square root equation 
in which eight times be thought to be 

1435
01:09:51,201 --> 01:09:52,034
numbers was not equal to b times.
That was equal to the negative of b 

1436
01:09:54,981 --> 01:09:56,450
times a.
So it was like,

1437
01:09:56,451 --> 01:09:59,990
what two numbers when you multiply them 
matter in which order.

1438
01:10:00,300 --> 01:10:02,060
There wasn't numbers,
it was matrices.

1439
01:10:02,870 --> 01:10:04,670
So this was one of the great insights,
you know,

1440
01:10:04,780 --> 01:10:08,870
rival Tine Stein in terms of the depth 
of what it told us about the universe.

1441
01:10:09,470 --> 01:10:11,600
Most of us haven't really heard of Paul 
to rock.

1442
01:10:11,660 --> 01:10:12,493
We don't realize that he has.
One of the three most important 

1443
01:10:14,181 --> 01:10:18,350
equations in physics now in when you say
three most important,

1444
01:10:18,351 --> 01:10:19,184
important in how it's applicable to 
everyday life or important and how it's 

1445
01:10:25,070 --> 01:10:28,670
given us an understanding and quantum 
physics or important.

1446
01:10:28,671 --> 01:10:32,060
How it's understand it's,
it's understanding is is significant.

1447
01:10:32,061 --> 01:10:35,630
Quantum physics,
we're talking about bedrock reality like

1448
01:10:35,631 --> 01:10:39,320
you and I are having a conversation and 
if you're a matrix fan and what we might

1449
01:10:39,321 --> 01:10:40,840
call the construct.
Okay.

1450
01:10:40,970 --> 01:10:45,380
What is the construct made have made?
So the way I do it is I think of it as a

1451
01:10:45,381 --> 01:10:48,050
newspaper story.
There's where and when did it happen?

1452
01:10:49,190 --> 01:10:52,370
There was who and what was involved and 
there's how and why.

1453
01:10:52,790 --> 01:10:54,320
Okay,
so we're in,

1454
01:10:54,321 --> 01:10:56,270
when is space and time clearly

1455
01:10:57,820 --> 01:11:00,010
the WHO and the what?
To me,

1456
01:11:00,070 --> 01:11:02,620
let's say the who is the spinoff aerial 
stuff.

1457
01:11:02,650 --> 01:11:04,420
It's like electrons,
protons,

1458
01:11:04,421 --> 01:11:06,010
neutrons,
corks,

1459
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:07,233
the stuff that we're made of and then 
you and I are only able to see each 

1460
01:11:09,641 --> 01:11:13,980
other because we're passing photons back
and forth which are forced particles.

1461
01:11:14,550 --> 01:11:16,330
They're not spinning royal.
They,

1462
01:11:16,850 --> 01:11:20,310
they come back to themselves after 360 
degrees.

1463
01:11:20,311 --> 01:11:24,000
They don't require 7:20.
So this is sort of the,

1464
01:11:24,690 --> 01:11:25,890
you know,
if you were going to go to a play,

1465
01:11:25,891 --> 01:11:29,310
you'd have the,
the dramatic personnel of the play given

1466
01:11:29,311 --> 01:11:33,000
to you at the beginning.
So this is what this universe is,

1467
01:11:33,030 --> 01:11:37,090
it's a story about space and time in 
wherein,

1468
01:11:37,140 --> 01:11:39,820
when about what is in that,
you know,

1469
01:11:39,830 --> 01:11:40,663
like who are the players and what 
equipment are they using that's like 

1470
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:46,020
Bozo firmagon's and then there's the how
and the why,

1471
01:11:46,021 --> 01:11:49,440
which is the equations and the Lagrand 
genes that govern the rules of play.

1472
01:11:50,760 --> 01:11:51,720
You know.
So for example,

1473
01:11:51,721 --> 01:11:53,510
if you and I,
you know,

1474
01:11:53,550 --> 01:11:57,720
start to go to the beach and uh,
we've got a ball and a net and you think

1475
01:11:57,721 --> 01:12:00,270
we're going to play volleyball.
And we actually sent me,

1476
01:12:00,271 --> 01:12:00,630
says,
no,

1477
01:12:00,630 --> 01:12:03,600
we're going to play Seapak tuck grow,
which is like volleyball played with the

1478
01:12:03,601 --> 01:12:05,730
feet in a martial art style,
which is awesome.

1479
01:12:06,120 --> 01:12:08,280
Yeah,
we showed a video on that recently.

1480
01:12:08,650 --> 01:12:12,420
Sleeves from Thailand or Bali there.
They're really good at amazing.

1481
01:12:12,450 --> 01:12:13,920
It's amazing.
It's like ballet,

1482
01:12:13,921 --> 01:12:16,470
martial arts,
soccer and volleyball happening.

1483
01:12:16,471 --> 01:12:18,180
One thing we should,
we should do this as a nation.

1484
01:12:19,470 --> 01:12:20,303
That's a different set of rules for a 
ball and a net in two teams that you 

1485
01:12:26,461 --> 01:12:28,380
could have done it.
One way is volleyball and you could have

1486
01:12:28,381 --> 01:12:30,980
done it another way,
a Seapak Tucker,

1487
01:12:30,981 --> 01:12:32,520
were you using your feet,
not your hands.

1488
01:12:33,270 --> 01:12:34,560
So those.

1489
01:12:34,710 --> 01:12:37,440
That's sort of the breakdown of what a 
physics theory is.

1490
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:38,633
You got to tell me where and when you 
got to tell me what's in the game and 

1491
01:12:40,591 --> 01:12:44,250
you gotta tell me what the rules are and
that's what this place is.

1492
01:12:44,370 --> 01:12:45,203
So theoretical physics is the most 
interesting of all of these fields to 

1493
01:12:49,021 --> 01:12:49,854
me,
not because it speaks to us about our 

1494
01:12:50,581 --> 01:12:53,190
daily lives because it speaks to us 
about,

1495
01:12:53,191 --> 01:12:54,580
well where are we?
Where is,

1496
01:12:54,600 --> 01:12:55,433
where is this thing taking place?
So it seems to me that there's a small 

1497
01:13:00,631 --> 01:13:05,631
number of people like that are studying 
this stuff that are.

1498
01:13:08,280 --> 01:13:13,280
They're getting passed biology,
they're getting past gravity,

1499
01:13:14,730 --> 01:13:17,100
climate change,
all these different variables that we're

1500
01:13:17,101 --> 01:13:17,934
constantly dealing with and they're,
they're getting to the very things that 

1501
01:13:23,311 --> 01:13:28,290
make everything and what is it under the
wiring lift,

1502
01:13:28,291 --> 01:13:31,050
lift up the board,
what's going on in here?

1503
01:13:31,230 --> 01:13:32,063
Right?
It's like getting into a computer down 

1504
01:13:32,821 --> 01:13:35,550
to the zero and one logic gates,
right?

1505
01:13:35,660 --> 01:13:38,010
Yeah.
So that thing.

1506
01:13:38,970 --> 01:13:39,803
We've got three or four equations.
We've got three or four different kinds 

1507
01:13:44,041 --> 01:13:44,874
of objects in the system.
We seem to be and people are going to 

1508
01:13:48,420 --> 01:13:50,580
not like what I'm about to say,
but screw them.

1509
01:13:51,120 --> 01:13:55,560
We seem to be almost at the end,
like these equations are so beautiful.

1510
01:13:55,561 --> 01:13:56,394
They're so tight that it's almost most 
mysterious because it feels like this 

1511
01:14:01,291 --> 01:14:03,840
thing like a movie that ended 
prematurely.

1512
01:14:04,470 --> 01:14:06,720
How so?
Well,

1513
01:14:08,790 --> 01:14:12,460
when we found the Higgs particle at the 
LHC,

1514
01:14:13,420 --> 01:14:18,420
there wasn't anything left that needed 
to close to explain the system.

1515
01:14:20,351 --> 01:14:22,900
We know that there's dark matter out 
there that we don't understand.

1516
01:14:22,901 --> 01:14:23,734
We know that there's dark energy out 
there that we don't understand because 

1517
01:14:25,511 --> 01:14:26,344
of astronomical observations,
but all the stuff that we know about 

1518
01:14:30,490 --> 01:14:31,323
when you look at it and collided at high
energies and figure out what mutates 

1519
01:14:33,611 --> 01:14:34,444
into what.

1520
01:14:34,480 --> 01:14:36,340
There's nothing missing anymore.
So it's like.

1521
01:14:37,300 --> 01:14:41,710
It's like you have got this odd thing 
where everything got very,

1522
01:14:41,711 --> 01:14:44,320
very simple,
very unified,

1523
01:14:45,820 --> 01:14:46,653
and it felt like we were going to get 
one or two more giant unification and 

1524
01:14:49,541 --> 01:14:50,374
the whole thing would be tied up with a 
bow and right now we just don't have 

1525
01:14:54,160 --> 01:14:56,950
anything that is needed to close the 
system.

1526
01:14:57,700 --> 01:15:01,090
So for example,
when you have radioactive carbon decay,

1527
01:15:01,750 --> 01:15:04,780
um,
what you see is that one of the neutrons

1528
01:15:04,810 --> 01:15:09,580
flips into being a proton and it spits 
out an electronic when it does that,

1529
01:15:09,820 --> 01:15:10,653
right?
So it's like,

1530
01:15:10,750 --> 01:15:14,380
it's like a trans nucleonics.
It shifts what it is.

1531
01:15:15,430 --> 01:15:16,263
Okay.
That electron doesn't carry off enough 

1532
01:15:18,611 --> 01:15:22,510
energy to explain how energy would be 
conserved.

1533
01:15:22,511 --> 01:15:24,670
There was something missing.
So this guy,

1534
01:15:24,671 --> 01:15:25,504
Wolfgang Pauli said,
I bet there's a particle that's neutral 

1535
01:15:28,331 --> 01:15:29,164
so we can't see it.
We won't leave a track in a cloud 

1536
01:15:30,761 --> 01:15:31,540
chamber.

1537
01:15:31,540 --> 01:15:34,180
It won't have any effect that we can see
electromagnetically,

1538
01:15:34,480 --> 01:15:35,313
but it's carrying away some of the 
energy because I'm not going to give up 

1539
01:15:36,930 --> 01:15:37,763
on conservation of energy just because 
this particular process doesn't seem to 

1540
01:15:41,801 --> 01:15:43,000
conserve it.
And sure enough,

1541
01:15:43,810 --> 01:15:48,370
there was the sneaky particle that was 
spiriting away,

1542
01:15:48,371 --> 01:15:49,204
some of the energy of the system that 
couldn't be seen because it didn't 

1543
01:15:50,861 --> 01:15:51,694
interact electromagnetically and it 
didn't interact according to the strong 

1544
01:15:55,991 --> 01:15:56,824
force.
The only thing you could use to trap it 

1545
01:15:57,761 --> 01:15:59,800
would be the weak force.
The weak force was so weak.

1546
01:15:59,801 --> 01:16:01,990
That was very hard to see it.
Okay,

1547
01:16:01,991 --> 01:16:02,824
well,
there's no new tree that I know have 

1548
01:16:05,291 --> 01:16:06,124
left to find.
There's no thing that's missing in our 

1549
01:16:09,281 --> 01:16:11,920
standard model and I'm just not 
satisfied.

1550
01:16:11,921 --> 01:16:13,870
Nobody's satisfied that the play is 
over.

1551
01:16:14,790 --> 01:16:15,623
Why would the play be over?
Just because we've discovered all the 

1552
01:16:18,221 --> 01:16:19,054
neutrinos?

1553
01:16:19,930 --> 01:16:21,480
Well,
no,

1554
01:16:21,490 --> 01:16:22,323
it's that we had an easy job when there 
was stuff that was missing and then you 

1555
01:16:25,931 --> 01:16:26,764
just hypothesize.
I bet there's some invisible thing 

1556
01:16:28,241 --> 01:16:29,074
that's carrying away some stuff.
Let's go look for something that's hard 

1557
01:16:30,971 --> 01:16:32,710
to see.
So they find it.

1558
01:16:32,770 --> 01:16:34,960
And so they'd find the higgs.
So they find the higgs,

1559
01:16:34,961 --> 01:16:38,140
they find the neutrinos,
they find torque glue on plasma.

1560
01:16:38,141 --> 01:16:38,974
And a lot was going to go there.
But I was going to say that they found 

1561
01:16:41,420 --> 01:16:42,253
like alternate generations of matter,
so you and I are made out of the first 

1562
01:16:45,581 --> 01:16:46,414
generation of matter,
but there could be alternate Joe Rogan 

1563
01:16:49,300 --> 01:16:51,640
made out of second generation or third 
generation.

1564
01:16:51,641 --> 01:16:53,890
We don't know of any generations beyond 
these two.

1565
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:55,100
Hold up.
Yeah.

1566
01:16:55,270 --> 01:16:56,103
What are you talking about?

1567
01:16:58,030 --> 01:16:58,863
So like the electron has,
it has a relative called them yuan that 

1568
01:17:04,310 --> 01:17:08,530
behaves exactly like the electronic,
except it's heavier and the uptown,

1569
01:17:08,590 --> 01:17:09,423
the up and quarks that make up protons 
and neutrons have relatives called 

1570
01:17:12,141 --> 01:17:12,974
strange quirks and charmed corks.
So there's like a second copy of Lego 

1571
01:17:16,670 --> 01:17:19,190
that has all the same properties as the 
first copy of Lego,

1572
01:17:19,700 --> 01:17:23,960
except it's at a different mass level,
which is denser,

1573
01:17:24,380 --> 01:17:27,920
but it's almost identical copy.
And nobody wanted this thing.

1574
01:17:27,921 --> 01:17:31,330
So the famous jokes there was this guy 
is a door robbie who was like a,

1575
01:17:31,360 --> 01:17:33,010
you know,
kind of an ethnic Jew in,

1576
01:17:33,020 --> 01:17:33,760
in,
in,

1577
01:17:33,760 --> 01:17:35,060
uh,
in New York.

1578
01:17:35,120 --> 01:17:37,220
And when they found the second 
generation of matter,

1579
01:17:37,370 --> 01:17:40,610
he responded as if it was a group of 
people at a deli.

1580
01:17:40,611 --> 01:17:41,630
And he said,
who ordered that?

1581
01:17:41,750 --> 01:17:42,583
You know,
and so that's,

1582
01:17:42,700 --> 01:17:44,600
that's the joke.
And physics who ordered that?

1583
01:17:45,140 --> 01:17:46,880
Nobody knew there was a second 
generation.

1584
01:17:46,881 --> 01:17:48,650
And then like,
then they hit us over the head,

1585
01:17:48,710 --> 01:17:50,150
you know,
there's a third one too.

1586
01:17:51,080 --> 01:17:52,760
Everybody's just like,
what?

1587
01:17:53,540 --> 01:17:56,660
Why,
where are these things coming from?

1588
01:17:56,661 --> 01:17:57,494
So the fact that you don't know this,
like what a profound disconnect that 

1589
01:18:01,311 --> 01:18:03,230
you're having all these physicists on 
the show.

1590
01:18:04,130 --> 01:18:06,200
And these are the basic secrets that 
were,

1591
01:18:06,220 --> 01:18:07,640
were,
these are rock solid,

1592
01:18:07,790 --> 01:18:09,830
these aren't,
this isn't speculative multi-verse.

1593
01:18:09,831 --> 01:18:13,520
String theory will move Schrodinger's 
cat stuff,

1594
01:18:13,521 --> 01:18:14,360
you know,
this is like,

1595
01:18:15,170 --> 01:18:16,003
this is ground truth and we don't know 
it and we don't know it because nobody 

1596
01:18:20,271 --> 01:18:22,130
will show you a picture of the 
vibration.

1597
01:18:22,640 --> 01:18:23,473
Or there's a concept called the group,
which is how we think about symmetry 

1598
01:18:26,780 --> 01:18:27,613
that no mathematician or physicist can 
go a day without talking about groups 

1599
01:18:31,401 --> 01:18:32,234
almost.
And we act as if it doesn't need to be 

1600
01:18:34,641 --> 01:18:35,540
taught in high school.

1601
01:18:36,680 --> 01:18:38,600
Like it's too.
It'll blow your mind.

1602
01:18:38,601 --> 01:18:40,430
We're not going to teach you.
The groups even exists.

1603
01:18:40,431 --> 01:18:45,431
So we built the professional version of 
the subject around objects that we don't

1604
01:18:45,861 --> 01:18:50,450
even tell you exist when you're studying
in school.

1605
01:18:50,990 --> 01:18:55,930
So if you think about the portal story 
in childhood,

1606
01:18:56,540 --> 01:18:57,373
there's the story about either it's a 
rabbit hole or a looking glass or a 

1607
01:19:00,681 --> 01:19:04,160
wardrobe or platform nine and a half or 
whatever these things are.

1608
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:06,290
I don't know what the Harry Potter 
version of it,

1609
01:19:06,360 --> 01:19:07,193
but how do I get from the world that I'm
in to this new amazing world and even 

1610
01:19:12,711 --> 01:19:13,544
find out that it's there.
And that's what I think theoretical 

1611
01:19:15,081 --> 01:19:19,280
physics has failed to do.
It hasn't built a portal for most people

1612
01:19:19,281 --> 01:19:22,370
to even understand what the issues are.
What are the objects?

1613
01:19:22,371 --> 01:19:23,204
What is the game?
How close are we to understanding what 

1614
01:19:25,371 --> 01:19:28,130
existence itself is,
which I think we're very,

1615
01:19:28,131 --> 01:19:28,964
very close.

1616
01:19:30,050 --> 01:19:31,670
And the square root.
This was,

1617
01:19:31,671 --> 01:19:32,504
I was going to say before about Derok is
like the most profound object and 

1618
01:19:36,741 --> 01:19:40,070
mathematics to me.
And the reason is is that when I ask you

1619
01:19:40,071 --> 01:19:40,904
what is the square root of negative one,
that is a question that can be posed 

1620
01:19:44,541 --> 01:19:46,940
entirely within the familiar.
So the real,

1621
01:19:47,020 --> 01:19:48,470
the real numbers,
you're comfortable,

1622
01:19:48,860 --> 01:19:49,760
you know,
you owe money,

1623
01:19:49,761 --> 01:19:50,594
you have money.
So I need plus plus one and minus one 

1624
01:19:53,510 --> 01:19:58,510
square root and understand what w,
what times itself equals my number.

1625
01:19:59,660 --> 01:20:01,670
And when you say what's the square root 
of negative one,

1626
01:20:01,671 --> 01:20:03,770
there's no answer inside of the real 
line,

1627
01:20:04,850 --> 01:20:08,640
but there is inside of this extension 
called the complex numbers.

1628
01:20:08,730 --> 01:20:09,563
And so it's like you're in flatland and 
you're trying to figure out is there 

1629
01:20:12,271 --> 01:20:15,390
anything beyond flatland.
So the great thing about the square root

1630
01:20:15,391 --> 01:20:19,350
is it's a question you can ask in 
flatland that gets you out of flatland

1631
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:22,920
teases.
You confuse the shit out of me.

1632
01:20:23,010 --> 01:20:25,710
Are you with this?
I understood that part of it.

1633
01:20:25,711 --> 01:20:27,140
Yeah,
because I understood that part.

1634
01:20:27,150 --> 01:20:28,840
The complex numbers thing got weird when
you.

1635
01:20:28,860 --> 01:20:29,540
Okay.
Algebra.

1636
01:20:29,540 --> 01:20:32,670
So when I.
So when I'm taking like rotations of the

1637
01:20:32,670 --> 01:20:34,690
Coffee Cup where my arm isn't involved,
right?

1638
01:20:35,400 --> 01:20:37,920
I say okay,
is there a square root of that rotation?

1639
01:20:38,190 --> 01:20:39,570
Like what does that even mean?
Dude?

1640
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:40,793
All right,
well now I put my arm into the system 

1641
01:20:42,241 --> 01:20:46,520
and my arm plus Coffee Cup gives you 
spinners like,

1642
01:20:46,620 --> 01:20:47,453
oh dude,
I did not even know that spinners were 

1643
01:20:48,781 --> 01:20:49,614
here.
I did not know that any object required 

1644
01:20:51,931 --> 01:20:53,760
720 degrees of rotation.

1645
01:20:56,460 --> 01:20:58,980
So the cup arm system,
we just exhibited it.

1646
01:20:59,040 --> 01:20:59,873
You don't need to learn Clifford 
Algebra's or all of the extra jazz that 

1647
01:21:03,781 --> 01:21:05,610
would get you to spinners 
mathematically,

1648
01:21:06,270 --> 01:21:09,020
but you need to figure out how do I 
discover the war,

1649
01:21:09,060 --> 01:21:09,893
the hidden world.
Think about this from the perspective 

1650
01:21:12,301 --> 01:21:13,134
of,
of like Iowasca somebody takes Iowasca 

1651
01:21:16,500 --> 01:21:17,333
and they have no idea that their brain 
is capable of this alternate state or 

1652
01:21:20,551 --> 01:21:25,551
Lsd or five Meo dmt.
All of these things are like panic rooms

1653
01:21:26,551 --> 01:21:29,910
in the mind where if you lived in a 
house for 20 years,

1654
01:21:30,300 --> 01:21:31,133
you think you know your house and then 
one day you pull an old musty book off 

1655
01:21:33,691 --> 01:21:36,150
the shelf and suddenly the bookshelf 
swings open,

1656
01:21:36,780 --> 01:21:37,740
you know?
And I was like,

1657
01:21:37,830 --> 01:21:38,663
holy crap,
there's like a second home inside of my 

1658
01:21:40,501 --> 01:21:41,311
home.
Well,

1659
01:21:41,311 --> 01:21:44,880
that's a lot of what psychedelics,
psychedelics are like square roots.

1660
01:21:45,840 --> 01:21:47,550
Um,
in that their portals,

1661
01:21:47,580 --> 01:21:48,413
they can get you from the place that you
know into a place that you never 

1662
01:21:51,991 --> 01:21:53,280
imagined could exist.

1663
01:21:54,260 --> 01:21:55,093
Do you think that the teaching of groups
and a lot of these concepts in 

1664
01:21:58,920 --> 01:21:59,753
highschool would facilitate a better 
understanding of it from the general 

1665
01:22:05,801 --> 01:22:10,300
public and adulthood and the Gal and it 
would.

1666
01:22:10,930 --> 01:22:12,520
What do you think is the resistance to 
this?

1667
01:22:12,521 --> 01:22:15,760
It's just too complex or not applicable 
to jobs,

1668
01:22:16,120 --> 01:22:16,953
you know,
is that the idea behind it is not 

1669
01:22:18,281 --> 01:22:19,114
something that you use in everyday life 
so that it's just too weird to think 

1670
01:22:21,551 --> 01:22:24,960
about the fact that there's cousins to 
the electron that are fat and

1671
01:22:25,030 --> 01:22:28,900
a much worse than this bodybuilder 
cousin to the.

1672
01:22:30,510 --> 01:22:34,010
You want to bulk up and get made that 
have strange quirks.

1673
01:22:34,310 --> 01:22:37,330
One of your cousins is made out of lead.
No,

1674
01:22:37,400 --> 01:22:39,830
I think it's much worse than this.
I think that first of all,

1675
01:22:39,831 --> 01:22:44,210
people are terrified of just how smart 
children are and the differences between

1676
01:22:44,211 --> 01:22:45,044
children have to be buried.
So some children are graded abstraction 

1677
01:22:49,850 --> 01:22:50,683
and a lot of the kids were great at 
abstraction or learning disabled 

1678
01:22:52,580 --> 01:22:55,310
according to the teaching system.
Now,

1679
01:22:55,311 --> 01:22:56,144
I personally think that most learning 
disabilities have a particular type are 

1680
01:22:58,941 --> 01:22:59,774
actually teaching disability.
People don't know how to teach the 

1681
01:23:02,541 --> 01:23:07,541
smartest kids and groups and things.
You're going to lose some people because

1682
01:23:09,371 --> 01:23:12,040
of the level of abstraction,
but you're going to get other people who

1683
01:23:12,070 --> 01:23:12,903
have never been able to buy a base hit 
and mathematics suddenly start over 

1684
01:23:16,411 --> 01:23:17,244
performing.
So the problem is that when you teach 

1685
01:23:19,331 --> 01:23:20,164
this stuff,
it's very disruptive to notions of the 

1686
01:23:23,921 --> 01:23:25,510
hierarchy.
Have you

1687
01:23:25,640 --> 01:23:29,720
thought about what are the causes of 
these different levels of perception?

1688
01:23:30,140 --> 01:23:32,420
Is it education?
Is it genetics,

1689
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:37,480
is it environmental?
Is it some sort of a chemical balance of

1690
01:23:38,301 --> 01:23:39,220
the mind?
Like what?

1691
01:23:39,221 --> 01:23:40,054
What do you think causes people to be 
more perceptive to some of these 

1692
01:23:43,191 --> 01:23:44,024
concepts?

1693
01:23:44,530 --> 01:23:45,363
It's a good question.
So the thing I just showed you with the 

1694
01:23:47,260 --> 01:23:49,630
planet earth in a way that you've never 
seen it before.

1695
01:23:50,740 --> 01:23:54,310
I know of only two people who've ever 
created that image.

1696
01:23:55,050 --> 01:23:58,030
I'm one of them.
Drawing Barden Aton is the other,

1697
01:23:58,060 --> 01:24:01,620
maybe there are many more,
but I've never heard of or met them.

1698
01:24:01,990 --> 01:24:05,530
The number of people first of all know 
what the hop vibration is,

1699
01:24:06,190 --> 01:24:07,023
I would guess is really deeply know it.
It is a few thousand people in the 

1700
01:24:10,301 --> 01:24:12,910
world,
so if none of those people are gifted at

1701
01:24:12,911 --> 01:24:14,740
trying to visualize or none of them 
care,

1702
01:24:15,380 --> 01:24:16,213
none of them program computers,
the number of people who could present 

1703
01:24:19,511 --> 01:24:20,344
that to the world is so small.
It's such a tiny priestly class that 

1704
01:24:24,641 --> 01:24:29,641
your odds of getting anyone figuring out
how to make this understandable are very

1705
01:24:30,851 --> 01:24:31,684
small.
So we're talking about a very small 

1706
01:24:34,001 --> 01:24:34,834
priesthood,
most of whom are too busy trying to do 

1707
01:24:36,821 --> 01:24:38,260
new research,
to want to care,

1708
01:24:38,261 --> 01:24:39,010
to communicate.

1709
01:24:39,010 --> 01:24:41,050
Many of whom are not gifted 
communicators.

1710
01:24:41,770 --> 01:24:45,310
Many of us realize that we don't fully 
understand these things.

1711
01:24:45,311 --> 01:24:46,144
I mean like I can.
I can show you spinners mathematically 

1712
01:24:48,671 --> 01:24:49,504
on a page,
but if you asked me in my darkest 

1713
01:24:51,221 --> 01:24:52,054
moments,
do I believe that man really knows what 

1714
01:24:53,411 --> 01:24:54,790
spinners are?
I don't think so.

1715
01:24:54,791 --> 01:24:55,624
This,
there's all this stuff that to me looks 

1716
01:24:57,131 --> 01:24:59,950
like the monolith in 2001,
it's just too freaky,

1717
01:24:59,951 --> 01:25:02,740
comes out of nowhere and it's at the 
core of reality.

1718
01:25:03,420 --> 01:25:05,050
Like if you really want to blow your 
mind,

1719
01:25:06,280 --> 01:25:09,940
look at a tiny number,
tiny collection of these objects,

1720
01:25:10,020 --> 01:25:15,020
a principal fibrations spinners,
exceptionally groups this eight,

1721
01:25:15,310 --> 01:25:18,250
248 dimensional monster.
This,

1722
01:25:18,251 --> 01:25:19,090
uh,
what is that?

1723
01:25:20,620 --> 01:25:23,890
There's a 248 dimensional set of 
cemeteries,

1724
01:25:23,980 --> 01:25:24,813
which seems to live only to be the 
symmetries of itself where everything 

1725
01:25:29,891 --> 01:25:34,891
else seems to live to symmetry,
tries something else and Nope,

1726
01:25:35,760 --> 01:25:38,740
this might have to spark that joint back
up again.

1727
01:25:39,040 --> 01:25:41,910
Let's do that.
You know,

1728
01:25:41,950 --> 01:25:42,783
there's this thing called the tits Fred 
and fall magic square after this guy 

1729
01:25:45,341 --> 01:25:48,580
named Chuck teats.
And um,

1730
01:25:49,990 --> 01:25:51,650
these guys,
uh,

1731
01:25:51,670 --> 01:25:56,670
figured out how to generate these sets 
of symmetries of dimension.

1732
01:25:57,430 --> 01:26:00,900
Fifty to 78,
133 and 248.

1733
01:26:01,480 --> 01:26:02,313
We don't know why they're there.
They're like plot of Pi and a kid knows 

1734
01:26:05,690 --> 01:26:08,360
of the mathematical world.
They're just different.

1735
01:26:09,140 --> 01:26:11,330
They don't seem to relate to anything 
else that we,

1736
01:26:11,420 --> 01:26:12,253
that we know yet,
and that's what's so fascinating about 

1737
01:26:17,331 --> 01:26:20,870
them and these are discovered by people 
that are trying to figure out the nature

1738
01:26:20,871 --> 01:26:21,704
of reality.
They're discovered by people trying to 

1739
01:26:22,971 --> 01:26:23,804
find more of these bizarre equation.
Who's who's discovering these in what's 

1740
01:26:30,921 --> 01:26:32,360
the impetus?
Like what?

1741
01:26:32,420 --> 01:26:33,253
What is will you ask?
Very natural questions like you've 

1742
01:26:35,241 --> 01:26:38,090
probably seen you ever played dungeons 
and dragons as a kid?

1743
01:26:38,270 --> 01:26:39,103
Luckily.
No.

1744
01:26:39,110 --> 01:26:42,590
Okay.
While you were beating people up,

1745
01:26:43,520 --> 01:26:44,180
stop it.

1746
01:26:44,180 --> 01:26:47,210
I've seen one video anyway.
You had these die,

1747
01:26:47,270 --> 01:26:47,720
right?
Yeah.

1748
01:26:47,720 --> 01:26:50,150
Like the cube die.
The tetrahedral die.

1749
01:26:50,180 --> 01:26:53,280
What does this shaming pattern beyond 
space time?

1750
01:26:53,390 --> 01:26:54,223
This is my eight d surface parents.
My Arch Nemesis when I was telling the 

1751
01:26:57,251 --> 01:26:59,330
story last time.
Sober October.

1752
01:26:59,331 --> 01:27:00,410
Yeah,
Garrett Lisi.

1753
01:27:00,660 --> 01:27:04,850
Bobby took me out into the jungle to 
meet this sort of differential geometric

1754
01:27:04,851 --> 01:27:08,280
warlord who lives in the north of Maui 
and the jungle farming.

1755
01:27:08,350 --> 01:27:09,920
Yeah.
Well you don't remember this.

1756
01:27:10,160 --> 01:27:11,060
I do now.
Yeah.

1757
01:27:11,061 --> 01:27:12,260
You cut off my story,
man.

1758
01:27:12,340 --> 01:27:12,980
Santa.
Yeah.

1759
01:27:12,980 --> 01:27:13,790
I'm sorry.
That's all right.

1760
01:27:13,790 --> 01:27:14,870
Go for it.
Here we are again.

1761
01:27:16,820 --> 01:27:19,730
Put that back up.
So whoa,

1762
01:27:20,090 --> 01:27:21,500
what is that?
Well,

1763
01:27:21,501 --> 01:27:24,080
this is,
this is based on the eight dimensional.

1764
01:27:24,110 --> 01:27:27,300
I'm almost certain it's gonna be based 
on the eight dimensional root system.

1765
01:27:27,301 --> 01:27:28,134
So inside of the 248 dimensions,
there's an eight dimensional donut 

1766
01:27:33,710 --> 01:27:35,450
called a tourists,
like an eight tourists,

1767
01:27:35,930 --> 01:27:39,710
and it generates this pattern and that 
pattern in some sense in codes,

1768
01:27:39,711 --> 01:27:43,520
the instructions for building the 248 
dimensional object.

1769
01:27:43,850 --> 01:27:44,683
So somebody probably pushed an eight 
dimensional thing into two dimensions 

1770
01:27:46,671 --> 01:27:50,980
for your viewing pleasure.
And does this accurate,

1771
01:27:51,030 --> 01:27:53,210
like when you're looking at this,
this image that we're seeing,

1772
01:27:53,211 --> 01:27:54,680
does that make sense to you?
I mean,

1773
01:27:54,681 --> 01:27:55,514
I could make,
I can relate it to things that make 

1774
01:27:56,821 --> 01:27:58,100
sense to me.
If the idea is,

1775
01:27:58,270 --> 01:27:59,103
you know,
can I look at it the way I'd look at a 

1776
01:27:59,871 --> 01:28:01,220
barcode and say,
oh,

1777
01:28:01,970 --> 01:28:03,220
tied unscented.
No,

1778
01:28:04,320 --> 01:28:06,110
I have no idea.
But um,

1779
01:28:06,470 --> 01:28:10,010
but this is an accurate representation 
if you looking at it in two dimensions.

1780
01:28:10,700 --> 01:28:11,690
Yeah.
So what,

1781
01:28:11,691 --> 01:28:14,630
what I'm,
what I'm trying to say is you don't even

1782
01:28:14,631 --> 01:28:17,720
know to worry about this pattern,
right?

1783
01:28:18,440 --> 01:28:20,990
Because you've never heard that these 
things exist,

1784
01:28:21,140 --> 01:28:24,740
and this is like the closest that we 
come to,

1785
01:28:24,780 --> 01:28:25,613
you know,
genuine mysticism where we have these 

1786
01:28:27,351 --> 01:28:29,000
objects.
If there are aliens,

1787
01:28:29,660 --> 01:28:30,493
they know about ie eight because the 
eight or the aliens one ea does the 

1788
01:28:36,440 --> 01:28:37,273
alien.

1789
01:28:37,420 --> 01:28:39,080
I've been,
I mean,

1790
01:28:39,130 --> 01:28:40,130
I,
we'll go to this later.

1791
01:28:40,131 --> 01:28:41,390
I don't want to interrupt your story 
again,

1792
01:28:41,520 --> 01:28:44,140
but I have an idea.
So what I'm,

1793
01:28:44,141 --> 01:28:44,974
what I'm trying to get at is this is the
majesty and mystery of being a 

1794
01:28:48,291 --> 01:28:51,140
mathematic mathematician or a physicist.
These findings.

1795
01:28:51,170 --> 01:28:53,720
So if I was to say about dungeons and 
dragons,

1796
01:28:53,721 --> 01:28:57,470
you're given these dice where the normal
day is always a cube,

1797
01:28:58,190 --> 01:29:01,280
but the platonic solids,
you can have an octahedron tetrahedron,

1798
01:29:01,290 --> 01:29:02,580
Dodecahedron,
icosahedron,

1799
01:29:02,581 --> 01:29:06,630
all these things.
There's an analog of those five platonic

1800
01:29:06,631 --> 01:29:07,464
solids in the next dimension up.
So I think they're called convicts 

1801
01:29:10,651 --> 01:29:11,484
polytopes.
So each one of those objects has an 

1802
01:29:13,111 --> 01:29:13,944
analog one dimension up,
but was found out in the late 18 

1803
01:29:17,131 --> 01:29:17,964
hundreds that there's a new platonic 
solid and dimension for called the 24 

1804
01:29:21,631 --> 01:29:22,464
says you want to bring up the 24 cell 
and find an animated video of somebody 

1805
01:29:26,731 --> 01:29:27,564
rotating this thing.
So like this is something that Plato 

1806
01:29:29,881 --> 01:29:30,714
knew nothing about.
We don't really understand what it's 

1807
01:29:32,880 --> 01:29:37,880
doing there in four dimensions.
These are like communications from uh,

1808
01:29:37,960 --> 01:29:42,040
the cosmos.
So this is like when Jodie foster was in

1809
01:29:42,041 --> 01:29:42,874
the movie contact and they were getting 
them signals about how to make the time 

1810
01:29:45,430 --> 01:29:47,950
machine maybe or the portal machine.
Yeah.

1811
01:29:47,951 --> 01:29:52,150
But this is on this stuff just doesn't 
come with an instruction manual.

1812
01:29:52,151 --> 01:29:55,420
So part of it is you can prove that 
these things are there

1813
01:29:57,800 --> 01:29:58,633
and you don't know why they're there and
some of them touch everything and some 

1814
01:30:01,551 --> 01:30:03,590
of them have yet to touch almost 
anything.

1815
01:30:04,340 --> 01:30:05,173
And it's like a communication from pure 
design that there is so much beautiful 

1816
01:30:09,441 --> 01:30:13,580
structure and so much grace in the 
universe that we're just,

1817
01:30:15,240 --> 01:30:17,340
what the fuck is this doing here?
What is it?

1818
01:30:17,610 --> 01:30:19,200
Right,
well what is everything,

1819
01:30:19,201 --> 01:30:20,490
right?
What is the whole thing?

1820
01:30:20,550 --> 01:30:21,300
No,
I mean look,

1821
01:30:21,300 --> 01:30:25,350
if you accept three dimensional space,
um,

1822
01:30:26,190 --> 01:30:30,480
or let's say this glass right?
If you accept this glass,

1823
01:30:30,930 --> 01:30:33,360
I understand that a circle can spin the 
glass.

1824
01:30:33,400 --> 01:30:37,320
The Circle circles worth of symmetries 
tells me what to do to spend the last.

1825
01:30:37,410 --> 01:30:38,850
That's not that confused,
right?

1826
01:30:39,270 --> 01:30:40,103
Why is there something that the analog 
of a circle where a circle I would call 

1827
01:30:43,260 --> 01:30:45,150
one dimensional because it's got one 
degree of freedom.

1828
01:30:45,930 --> 01:30:50,930
This thing is 248 dimensions and it 
doesn't seem to live to symmetry.

1829
01:30:51,551 --> 01:30:55,750
Tries it in the jargon.
We would say it doesn't have a,

1830
01:30:55,830 --> 01:30:56,663
a,
a defining representation of lower 

1831
01:30:58,051 --> 01:30:58,884
dimension.
So normally you have something of low 

1832
01:31:00,151 --> 01:31:02,380
dimension and you say what are its 
symmetries?

1833
01:31:02,470 --> 01:31:07,140
Symmetries are of higher dimension.
This thing seems like the first thing it

1834
01:31:07,141 --> 01:31:11,250
wants to symmetries as itself.
So it's kind of self referential.

1835
01:31:11,280 --> 01:31:16,280
It's kind of onanistic.
So it's like a zero point of creation.

1836
01:31:19,050 --> 01:31:22,410
That's poetic language and I would 
groove on that after 11:00

1837
01:31:22,410 --> 01:31:23,900
PM,
but I wouldn't call it that right now.

1838
01:31:23,901 --> 01:31:27,390
I would say I was trying to pick 
somebody up,

1839
01:31:27,540 --> 01:31:28,980
hey,
zero point of creation,

1840
01:31:29,010 --> 01:31:30,360
right?
That's a sexy word.

1841
01:31:30,530 --> 01:31:31,363
It's a sexy way of describing it,
but like if we were saying the big bang 

1842
01:31:35,340 --> 01:31:40,340
existed and that means some point in the
history of the universe,

1843
01:31:40,410 --> 01:31:41,243
it was this really tiny thing and it 
decided for whatever reason something 

1844
01:31:45,841 --> 01:31:47,820
happened and it became this enormous 
thing.

1845
01:31:48,090 --> 01:31:50,470
Sure.
Possibly enormous thing and it had.

1846
01:31:50,490 --> 01:31:52,890
There had to be a point where it 
started.

1847
01:31:52,950 --> 01:31:53,783
Right,
but so what I would say is we can 

1848
01:31:56,191 --> 01:31:57,024
competently take that story back to a 
and then we have to say we don't really 

1849
01:32:02,800 --> 01:32:05,440
believe that we have any insight beyond 
that point,

1850
01:32:05,710 --> 01:32:09,340
but people want to go there anyway.
We absolutely know that it was tiny,

1851
01:32:09,720 --> 01:32:12,430
small,
like a smaller than the head of a pin.

1852
01:32:12,820 --> 01:32:13,653
The whole thing.
I'm always uncomfortable saying the 

1853
01:32:16,820 --> 01:32:18,170
settlement.
You can,

1854
01:32:18,310 --> 01:32:19,143
you can say consensus.
You can say a lot of stuff about very 

1855
01:32:21,731 --> 01:32:23,870
early,
very small and it could.

1856
01:32:23,930 --> 01:32:25,240
That could turn out to be wrong

1857
01:32:26,160 --> 01:32:30,860
in a possibly long ago,
14 billion years ago in our minds.

1858
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,680
As far as tough for a guy like you 
mathematics,

1859
01:32:33,681 --> 01:32:36,500
you see it on your numbers and paper.
It all computes.

1860
01:32:36,830 --> 01:32:37,663
You see the numbers.
Fourteen dollars billion is a number 

1861
01:32:39,141 --> 01:32:39,974
that makes sense for sure.
But conceptually like for a dummy like 

1862
01:32:42,951 --> 01:32:45,020
me,
14 billion is like if I really,

1863
01:32:45,080 --> 01:32:45,913
if I'm being honest,
do I do I really have an accurate 

1864
01:32:48,351 --> 01:32:49,870
understanding what?
14 billion but,

1865
01:32:50,090 --> 01:32:53,000
but it's uneven Weinberg doesn't feel 
$14 million either.

1866
01:32:53,720 --> 01:32:54,400
Right.
But you know,

1867
01:32:54,400 --> 01:32:58,340
100 yards is 100 feet,
100 yards.

1868
01:32:58,341 --> 01:32:59,840
I'm like,
that's too far to shoot a bow.

1869
01:33:00,110 --> 01:33:01,640
Like you got to get a little closer to 
you.

1870
01:33:01,660 --> 01:33:04,430
So you have some,
you have some kind of an intuition pump.

1871
01:33:04,490 --> 01:33:05,540
Well,
you know,

1872
01:33:05,570 --> 01:33:07,850
distance.
It's a rational distance that you see on

1873
01:33:07,851 --> 01:33:10,430
a daily basis.
One hundred yards is a long distance.

1874
01:33:10,550 --> 01:33:11,870
A mile gets a little weird.

1875
01:33:12,260 --> 01:33:14,210
Like is that a mile away?
How far is that?

1876
01:33:14,570 --> 01:33:15,740
Oh,
it's six miles away.

1877
01:33:15,800 --> 01:33:17,450
Wow.
I didn't think it was that far.

1878
01:33:17,510 --> 01:33:18,230
Right?
Like there's,

1879
01:33:18,230 --> 01:33:20,000
there's weirdness in distance,
right?

1880
01:33:20,240 --> 01:33:24,740
But when you get to a hundred and 40 
million miles,

1881
01:33:25,250 --> 01:33:26,780
okay,
I give up,

1882
01:33:26,781 --> 01:33:28,450
but you get to 40,
get fatigued,

1883
01:33:29,400 --> 01:33:32,000
get fatigued by that stuff that other 
people get energized.

1884
01:33:32,001 --> 01:33:33,230
Like,
yeah man,

1885
01:33:33,231 --> 01:33:35,540
you have no idea how long ago that it's 
humbling,

1886
01:33:36,050 --> 01:33:36,883
right?
But then there's the concept of 

1887
01:33:38,241 --> 01:33:39,074
infinite,
like this is one of the things that 

1888
01:33:40,821 --> 01:33:43,580
Krauss said,
or maybe it was Sean Carroll that said,

1889
01:33:43,581 --> 01:33:48,581
it's really not that we know that we can
see 14 billion years ago,

1890
01:33:49,050 --> 01:33:49,883
it's like,
but that's just as far back as we're 

1891
01:33:51,320 --> 01:33:55,610
capable of seeing right now.
And even if we did go further,

1892
01:33:55,611 --> 01:34:00,611
the light is actually moving slower.
Like you wouldn't be able to see it.

1893
01:34:01,400 --> 01:34:02,290
Right,
right,

1894
01:34:02,320 --> 01:34:03,153
right.
So you have this thing about what the 

1895
01:34:04,271 --> 01:34:07,630
spacetime metric,
which is sort of how things are,

1896
01:34:08,590 --> 01:34:11,520
feel like they're moving apart.
You know,

1897
01:34:11,590 --> 01:34:12,423
Einstein said four degrees of freedom 
plus rulers and protractors equal space 

1898
01:34:16,110 --> 01:34:19,630
spacetime,
right?

1899
01:34:19,631 --> 01:34:23,080
So a spacetime metric is a collection of
rulers and protractors.

1900
01:34:23,590 --> 01:34:24,423
So I can do length and angle,
including lengthen the time direction 

1901
01:34:27,760 --> 01:34:31,180
and that generates a derivative 
operator,

1902
01:34:31,181 --> 01:34:32,014
which we talked about before,
which is rise over run relative to 

1903
01:34:34,631 --> 01:34:35,464
accustom reference level.
The customer reference levels generate 

1904
01:34:38,921 --> 01:34:39,754
the staircase that we did and that 
generates the curvature tensor which 

1905
01:34:43,871 --> 01:34:44,704
generates gravity.
So strangely with all of this kind of 

1906
01:34:47,471 --> 01:34:50,110
like woo woo stuff that we've been 
doing,

1907
01:34:50,560 --> 01:34:51,393
we just came to a much better 
description of what theoretical physics 

1908
01:34:55,330 --> 01:34:57,470
actually looks like.
It's four degrees of freedom,

1909
01:34:57,590 --> 01:34:58,160
plus we're losing

1910
01:34:58,160 --> 01:35:01,940
protractors gives you derivative 
operators with customer reference level.

1911
01:35:01,950 --> 01:35:03,890
The customer reference levels don't knit
together.

1912
01:35:03,891 --> 01:35:04,724
That leads to an escher staircase.
The degree of this is the curvature 

1913
01:35:07,851 --> 01:35:09,800
tensor.
The curvature generates the gravity,

1914
01:35:10,010 --> 01:35:12,320
which is what's keeping you and I in our
chair.

1915
01:35:12,650 --> 01:35:14,630
I really appreciate that.
You're understood.

1916
01:35:14,640 --> 01:35:18,320
You're explaining this in a way that you
hope that someone can understand.

1917
01:35:18,490 --> 01:35:19,323
Well,
I'm not afraid,

1918
01:35:19,450 --> 01:35:22,040
I'm not a physicist,
but you're explaining it very well.

1919
01:35:22,450 --> 01:35:27,450
The problem is for someone like me,
I lack the tools to put there.

1920
01:35:28,100 --> 01:35:32,510
I don't have enough open slots for these
concepts.

1921
01:35:32,511 --> 01:35:33,344
So it's like.
It's like if you were explaining to me 

1922
01:35:35,660 --> 01:35:38,660
complex arguments in French,
but I didn't speak French,

1923
01:35:38,810 --> 01:35:40,090
so you were saying,
you know,

1924
01:35:40,210 --> 01:35:43,070
bones,
it means this and then you're explaining

1925
01:35:43,071 --> 01:35:45,110
all these other words and then you throw
it all together.

1926
01:35:45,111 --> 01:35:45,831
I'm like,
what?

1927
01:35:45,831 --> 01:35:46,664
And then it's cultural references and 
you have to deal with the fact that 

1928
01:35:48,530 --> 01:35:49,363
there's some historical precedent to 
certain types of behavior that I hadn't 

1929
01:35:51,891 --> 01:35:52,724
taken into consideration because he's a 
French people that have lived in this 

1930
01:35:54,831 --> 01:35:55,010
way.

1931
01:35:55,010 --> 01:35:56,240
Oh whoa.
Okay.

1932
01:35:56,241 --> 01:35:57,074
But look,
look,

1933
01:35:57,230 --> 01:35:58,950
that's nothing compared to what you're 
trying to.

1934
01:35:59,090 --> 01:36:00,220
Let's drop some.
Uh,

1935
01:36:00,600 --> 01:36:02,090
so,
so you do this thing about like,

1936
01:36:02,440 --> 01:36:04,040
well for meathead,
like me,

1937
01:36:04,150 --> 01:36:05,790
I'm definitely a meat head.
Stop it.

1938
01:36:05,970 --> 01:36:08,180
Listen,
I know me better than you know me.

1939
01:36:08,420 --> 01:36:09,253
That's true.
But you're also less honest than you 

1940
01:36:10,431 --> 01:36:12,590
think on this particular topic.
It's part of your chart that,

1941
01:36:12,700 --> 01:36:13,730
look,
when we hang out,

1942
01:36:14,330 --> 01:36:17,450
we hang out usually in a comedy club or 
at somebody's house,

1943
01:36:17,510 --> 01:36:20,290
right?
We don't say,

1944
01:36:20,300 --> 01:36:21,133
hey,
we're going to take the afternoon off 

1945
01:36:21,890 --> 01:36:23,870
and we're actually going to learn 
theoretical physics.

1946
01:36:24,530 --> 01:36:25,340
Right?
Right.

1947
01:36:25,340 --> 01:36:28,040
So when I went to a,
I did stand up for the first time,

1948
01:36:28,041 --> 01:36:30,450
as I told you in Arizona,
was there.

1949
01:36:30,770 --> 01:36:31,730
Oh,
it was insane.

1950
01:36:32,420 --> 01:36:33,650
It was crazy.
Yeah.

1951
01:36:33,680 --> 01:36:36,320
You try and explain fucking corks to 
people.

1952
01:36:40,450 --> 01:36:42,380
It'd be.
There'd be some real humor in that.

1953
01:36:42,381 --> 01:36:44,210
If you could boil it down.
Three quirks.

1954
01:36:44,211 --> 01:36:45,320
Go into a nuclear.
Yeah.

1955
01:36:45,321 --> 01:36:47,070
There's like a way to do it.
I don't know.

1956
01:36:47,490 --> 01:36:48,650
There's a way to do it.
Okay.

1957
01:36:49,250 --> 01:36:50,630
Well,
the who was the guy who did the.

1958
01:36:51,080 --> 01:36:53,030
Some guy was doing.
He was praying,

1959
01:36:53,090 --> 01:36:55,880
Cowen was doing quantum jokes.
What was he saying?

1960
01:36:55,940 --> 01:36:56,840
Do you remember?
I forgot.

1961
01:36:56,870 --> 01:36:57,703
He just.
He had a bunch of words that he did 

1962
01:36:58,641 --> 01:36:59,474
very,
very quickly and it kind of hung 

1963
01:37:00,111 --> 01:37:00,711
together.
I was like,

1964
01:37:00,711 --> 01:37:01,520
wait,
what?

1965
01:37:01,520 --> 01:37:02,840
Yeah,
that sounds like Brian.

1966
01:37:02,900 --> 01:37:03,860
Yeah,
he reads a lot,

1967
01:37:04,730 --> 01:37:06,740
but it's a clever boy.
When I,

1968
01:37:06,800 --> 01:37:10,100
when I had to do my 10 minutes of 
Standup,

1969
01:37:10,370 --> 01:37:12,680
man is that craft?
It's deep.

1970
01:37:12,770 --> 01:37:13,603
It's hard because you have to.
It's not just like telling jokes at a 

1971
01:37:15,471 --> 01:37:16,970
party.
It's really.

1972
01:37:17,240 --> 01:37:18,073
You have to measure the way the 
audiences laugh comes whether you're 

1973
01:37:19,701 --> 01:37:22,050
taking them along or you going to divert
all,

1974
01:37:22,080 --> 01:37:24,350
all sorts of things that I never thought
about before.

1975
01:37:24,520 --> 01:37:25,353
Do you know how you feel when you talk 
about the hop thing that it's a part of 

1976
01:37:29,001 --> 01:37:29,834
everything?
It's one of the most important things 

1977
01:37:31,611 --> 01:37:35,210
and yet very few people know what it is.
Maybe a thousand people understanding on

1978
01:37:35,211 --> 01:37:36,044
the whole world.
What's odd is that number is probably 

1979
01:37:39,351 --> 01:37:40,184
identical to the number of legitimate 
professional standup comedians in the 

1980
01:37:43,371 --> 01:37:45,260
world.
That's why when I say legitimate,

1981
01:37:45,261 --> 01:37:48,170
I mean someone who can craft a new hour 
every two years.

1982
01:37:48,171 --> 01:37:51,260
It does netflix specials who headlines 
all over the country.

1983
01:37:51,280 --> 01:37:52,520
It's small,
good,

1984
01:37:52,550 --> 01:37:54,700
traveled all over the world and do 
standup.

1985
01:37:54,710 --> 01:37:56,130
It's an small number

1986
01:37:56,130 --> 01:37:56,770
of humans.

1987
01:37:56,770 --> 01:37:57,603
Not only that.
My guess is that the number of people 

1988
01:37:59,411 --> 01:38:01,440
that you think are at the very top of 
that craft,

1989
01:38:01,441 --> 01:38:04,720
like when I really think about who 
really knows theoretical physics,

1990
01:38:04,750 --> 01:38:07,490
right?
It's tiny.

1991
01:38:07,500 --> 01:38:09,280
It's like fuck,
it's smaller than 50.

1992
01:38:09,430 --> 01:38:10,600
Yup.
Yup.

1993
01:38:10,920 --> 01:38:11,500
Guys that I would

1994
01:38:11,500 --> 01:38:13,990
pay to see live or women that are paid 
to see live,

1995
01:38:13,991 --> 01:38:14,490
it's less than

1996
01:38:14,490 --> 01:38:15,610
50th,
less than 50.

1997
01:38:16,070 --> 01:38:16,903
And so part of our problem is that all 
of the stuff that humanity is developed 

1998
01:38:22,650 --> 01:38:23,483
is often resident and a tiny number of 
minds and I feel very vulnerable about 

1999
01:38:28,171 --> 01:38:29,004
the theoretical physics has been faking 
that it's in a healthy state for a long 

2000
01:38:33,271 --> 01:38:34,104
time.
We are so vulnerable on the doorstep of 

2001
01:38:36,961 --> 01:38:39,120
actually cracking this puzzle in my 
opinion.

2002
01:38:39,740 --> 01:38:40,573
Um,

2003
01:38:40,960 --> 01:38:44,230
that's where our comparisons in because 
pretty much anybody could do stand up if

2004
01:38:44,231 --> 01:38:45,730
you put enough time to it,
if you're silly,

2005
01:38:45,910 --> 01:38:50,410
if you figured out the craft,
but would you guys are doing is not just

2006
01:38:50,440 --> 01:38:53,380
really rare,
but also the,

2007
01:38:53,800 --> 01:38:54,633
the barrier for entry,
like the cost of entry is exceptionally 

2008
01:38:57,641 --> 01:38:58,474
high.
Like you have to spend an inordinate 

2009
01:39:01,001 --> 01:39:01,834
amount of time studying and 
understanding this stuff just to get to 

2010
01:39:05,471 --> 01:39:08,380
a base level of what you've been able to
explain.

2011
01:39:08,650 --> 01:39:09,483
You've been explained like some really 
difficult concepts to the lay person 

2012
01:39:13,720 --> 01:39:14,553
that must've taken you fucking eons to 
learn and understand all your study of 

2013
01:39:19,900 --> 01:39:23,410
mathematics and of geometry and have all
that.

2014
01:39:23,440 --> 01:39:25,420
But I'm an imposter.
How so?

2015
01:39:26,470 --> 01:39:27,820
While I'm not a physicist.
Right?

2016
01:39:27,821 --> 01:39:30,460
But you understand it.
Maybe don't practice physics.

2017
01:39:30,470 --> 01:39:30,631
No,
no,

2018
01:39:30,631 --> 01:39:31,480
no.
I understand it.

2019
01:39:31,500 --> 01:39:33,390
Well,
no,

2020
01:39:33,420 --> 01:39:35,760
it's something more audacious than that,
which is that,

2021
01:39:36,160 --> 01:39:38,280
um,
when you see a,

2022
01:39:38,970 --> 01:39:40,260
you know,
a 10,000

2023
01:39:40,261 --> 01:39:43,020
hours only sign a,
you know,

2024
01:39:43,080 --> 01:39:45,270
only those who've done their 10,000
hours can come in.

2025
01:39:46,350 --> 01:39:48,890
My middle finger goes up.
I'm like,

2026
01:39:48,960 --> 01:39:51,930
I bet it's not 10,000
hours or if it is 10,000

2027
01:39:51,931 --> 01:39:52,764
hours,
I'm willing to get 80 percent of the 

2028
01:39:54,301 --> 01:39:56,880
juice in that orange with like 10 
percent of the effort.

2029
01:39:58,590 --> 01:40:02,030
The 10,000
hours thing to me is a,

2030
01:40:02,100 --> 01:40:06,270
it's cute,
but it doesn't factor in for phenoms.

2031
01:40:06,540 --> 01:40:07,373
It doesn't.

2032
01:40:07,520 --> 01:40:10,190
There's a lot of people that come into 
anything.

2033
01:40:10,191 --> 01:40:11,024
Whatever it is,
with some natural abilities that are 

2034
01:40:13,371 --> 01:40:14,450
pretty undeniable.

2035
01:40:15,100 --> 01:40:17,990
Um,
you know,

2036
01:40:18,800 --> 01:40:20,780
that's a weird,
that's a weird equation.

2037
01:40:21,080 --> 01:40:21,913
But take,
take something very simple like the 

2038
01:40:23,451 --> 01:40:24,610
harmonica.
Yeah.

2039
01:40:25,670 --> 01:40:26,503
Most people don't know that that sweet 
blues sound on a harmonica comes from 

2040
01:40:29,571 --> 01:40:31,640
not using it the way the manufacturer 
said,

2041
01:40:31,641 --> 01:40:32,474
which is called straight harp and using 
it instead the way African Americans 

2042
01:40:36,651 --> 01:40:37,484
figured it out,
which is it's much cooler to base it 

2043
01:40:39,320 --> 01:40:43,670
around a hole that nobody was expecting 
to draw rather than for blow.

2044
01:40:44,510 --> 01:40:49,220
And that gives you a seventh chord.
That sounds like sweet blues music.

2045
01:40:49,580 --> 01:40:51,640
If you start giving us some of that 
right.

2046
01:40:52,680 --> 01:40:53,513
I don't know how will work.

2047
01:41:10,320 --> 01:41:10,681
Okay.
That was.

2048
01:41:10,681 --> 01:41:11,490
You got to move,
but.

2049
01:41:11,490 --> 01:41:13,560
So what's the traditional way of using 
it?

2050
01:41:13,620 --> 01:41:14,453
What would it sound like?

2051
01:41:18,490 --> 01:41:19,323
Wow.

2052
01:41:22,320 --> 01:41:24,740
I think that would be carmen pouring his
fuck boy.

2053
01:41:24,830 --> 01:41:26,540
People music.
Boring as fuck white people.

2054
01:41:26,640 --> 01:41:29,140
God Damn it.
Why people at Carmen's alright,

2055
01:41:29,220 --> 01:41:31,020
but look,
that's not my point.

2056
01:41:31,650 --> 01:41:36,190
Who knew when you get one of these 
things as a party favor as a kid there's

2057
01:41:36,450 --> 01:41:37,440
somebody says,
Hey,

2058
01:41:37,800 --> 01:41:40,230
don't do that thing where you put your 
mouth over it.

2059
01:41:40,231 --> 01:41:41,580
I'll sign it.
You know?

2060
01:41:42,090 --> 01:41:43,460
But who knew that that's the coolest.
This.

2061
01:41:43,710 --> 01:41:44,543
Yeah,
but the idea is that there's something 

2062
01:41:45,421 --> 01:41:46,254
called tongue blocking.
There's something called cross harp and 

2063
01:41:48,211 --> 01:41:49,044
there's something called the one four,
five progression with a scale that no 

2064
01:41:51,090 --> 01:41:54,300
music teacher ever taught you in grade 
school and piano.

2065
01:41:54,730 --> 01:41:56,220
All right,
so there's four secrets

2066
01:41:57,760 --> 01:42:00,670
and now suddenly the world opens up.
I mean,

2067
01:42:02,810 --> 01:42:06,580
when I opened for Jordan Peterson,
Dave Rubin invited me and they said,

2068
01:42:06,910 --> 01:42:09,310
why don't you play a minute worth of 
harmonica at the Masonic Theater?

2069
01:42:09,311 --> 01:42:10,660
So for 2,500
people,

2070
01:42:10,661 --> 01:42:13,240
I became Dave Rubin's talking Harmonica 
Monkey.

2071
01:42:14,350 --> 01:42:15,820
So I opened for Jordan Peterson.
I said,

2072
01:42:16,060 --> 01:42:16,893
rule number zero,
life is too short not to play the 

2073
01:42:18,281 --> 01:42:19,114
harmonica.
Everyone should learn to play the 

2074
01:42:20,441 --> 01:42:22,480
harmonica or know why they're not doing 
it.

2075
01:42:22,481 --> 01:42:25,780
There's this great thing in the cal 
Berkeley fight song will win the game or

2076
01:42:25,781 --> 01:42:26,614
no?
The reason why if you don't play the 

2077
01:42:28,901 --> 01:42:31,000
harmonica,
it's so nice.

2078
01:42:31,060 --> 01:42:32,800
It's so simple.
So few people do it.

2079
01:42:32,801 --> 01:42:34,750
They're so small.
Number of secrets.

2080
01:42:35,620 --> 01:42:38,320
You have to have a reason because I can 
feed myself.

2081
01:42:38,370 --> 01:42:39,580
I can.
I can get housing,

2082
01:42:39,581 --> 01:42:41,620
shelter,
I can meet people anywhere in the world.

2083
01:42:41,621 --> 01:42:42,454
All I have to do is carry around a piece
of plastic with some metal on it or you 

2084
01:42:45,011 --> 01:42:48,670
can be annoying like a lot of people 
like turn that fucking guy off.

2085
01:42:48,670 --> 01:42:49,503
Why is he.
Why is he playing that Goddamn 

2086
01:42:50,650 --> 01:42:51,370
Harmonica?
I don't want to hear that.

2087
01:42:51,370 --> 01:42:53,330
Put it back in your pocket.
You could have your next champion.

2088
01:42:53,730 --> 01:42:55,720
You already tainted in these people's 
estimation.

2089
01:42:56,050 --> 01:42:59,280
Gets attention whore out of their mind.
My life.

2090
01:42:59,700 --> 01:43:00,730
Well,
what's worse?

2091
01:43:00,850 --> 01:43:01,683
A harmonica or a guy brings a guitar and
start singing folk songs at a party on 

2092
01:43:04,661 --> 01:43:06,070
the animal house effect,
right?

2093
01:43:06,140 --> 01:43:07,870
Yeah.
Beat him over the head with a guitar.

2094
01:43:08,260 --> 01:43:10,570
You can shred.
He's going to be fine.

2095
01:43:10,600 --> 01:43:11,433
It's great.
If you were looking to hear someone 

2096
01:43:12,731 --> 01:43:13,750
tread,
that's that.

2097
01:43:13,950 --> 01:43:14,783
Okay.
All of these things are like options of 

2098
01:43:16,691 --> 01:43:19,470
financial apps and you can exercise them
or you cannot exercise.

2099
01:43:19,520 --> 01:43:20,353
You don't have to exercise,
but there's an equal number of things 

2100
01:43:22,361 --> 01:43:24,640
that people would say that are like the 
Harmonica.

2101
01:43:24,930 --> 01:43:28,420
Like you should be able to do slam 
poetry.

2102
01:43:28,510 --> 01:43:29,343
Right?
Everyone should be able to do slam 

2103
01:43:29,951 --> 01:43:31,630
poetry.
If you can't do slam poetry,

2104
01:43:31,750 --> 01:43:33,290
I can feed myself.
I can help,

2105
01:43:33,310 --> 01:43:34,990
I can.
I can do slam poetry.

2106
01:43:35,260 --> 01:43:37,990
I'll show up at a party and everyone 
wants to hear slam poetry.

2107
01:43:39,170 --> 01:43:43,140
Is that true?
You're just trying to beat me Joe.

2108
01:43:43,141 --> 01:43:48,141
You're so adorable.
It's fascinating to me.

2109
01:43:48,841 --> 01:43:52,250
That's that harmonicas are this little

2110
01:43:52,250 --> 01:43:56,090
tiny thing that people have.
Like there's not other ones.

2111
01:43:56,180 --> 01:43:57,760
Right?
There's like other things.

2112
01:43:57,761 --> 01:43:58,594
I like these big old trumpet looking 
things like a harmonica is this little 

2113
01:44:01,401 --> 01:44:02,060
thing.
Yeah,

2114
01:44:02,060 --> 01:44:02,893
like how many little things do you blow?
Well that's what are that powerful in 

2115
01:44:05,541 --> 01:44:07,170
terms of like the kind of music did it 
makes.

2116
01:44:07,190 --> 01:44:08,510
Exactly.
Isn't that weird?

2117
01:44:08,511 --> 01:44:11,750
It is weird.
Like there's no like balls,

2118
01:44:12,140 --> 01:44:13,340
right?
It's always that.

2119
01:44:13,370 --> 01:44:17,090
It's always that little candy bar 
looking thing like there's nothing,

2120
01:44:17,330 --> 01:44:18,163
no ball harmonica,
comparable in terms of like musical 

2121
01:44:21,291 --> 01:44:24,280
instruments that does that little nut 
that has that kind of sound.

2122
01:44:24,300 --> 01:44:25,700
No,
that's what it's optimized for,

2123
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:26,833
but isn't that weird?
Like there's two buzz and there's other 

2124
01:44:28,851 --> 01:44:32,300
things that are similar and then you get
to like trombones and trumpets.

2125
01:44:32,301 --> 01:44:35,150
Everything kind of makes sense.
Then you got this little fucking thing,

2126
01:44:35,151 --> 01:44:36,440
so candy bar thing,
right?

2127
01:44:37,190 --> 01:44:39,200
A mouth heart,
a mouth harp.

2128
01:44:39,350 --> 01:44:40,460
Ooh.
What's that other one?

2129
01:44:40,461 --> 01:44:41,130
They bought.
Knowing,

2130
01:44:41,130 --> 01:44:41,721
knowing,
knowing,

2131
01:44:41,721 --> 01:44:42,950
knowing,
knowing these two Jews,

2132
01:44:42,951 --> 01:44:44,780
those Jews.
Old timey movies.

2133
01:44:44,810 --> 01:44:45,960
Is that what it's called?
Boring.

2134
01:44:46,070 --> 01:44:46,903
Boring.
Boring.

2135
01:44:47,690 --> 01:44:51,560
Now this is like a weird word for it is 
a weird word for that thing.

2136
01:44:52,270 --> 01:44:53,880
John Harp.
Yeah.

2137
01:44:56,180 --> 01:44:57,950
Maybe I'm thinking of a complete.
Okay.

2138
01:44:58,300 --> 01:44:59,180
Yeah.
That's one.

2139
01:44:59,480 --> 01:45:00,313
Yeah.
That's another weird one where you can 

2140
01:45:02,211 --> 01:45:04,460
play the spoons.
Spoons are good.

2141
01:45:04,790 --> 01:45:05,623
Well,
how about that fucking Australian one 

2142
01:45:06,830 --> 01:45:10,100
where they blow into the big ones the 
most.

2143
01:45:10,460 --> 01:45:11,293
That is like how hard were those guys 
trip and when they came up with that 

2144
01:45:13,860 --> 01:45:14,693
sound,
why do I wear like if you're in this 

2145
01:45:19,880 --> 01:45:22,070
like Tuvan throat singing did that.
He's good.

2146
01:45:22,270 --> 01:45:23,103
Thank you.
If you're on Haight Ashbury and there's 

2147
01:45:24,561 --> 01:45:28,580
a dude and he's got one of them diggory 
dues out fucking hat.

2148
01:45:28,581 --> 01:45:29,780
You're supposed to throw some money in 
there.

2149
01:45:29,781 --> 01:45:30,614
Just out of respect.
This guy brought a God damn degree due 

2150
01:45:32,601 --> 01:45:33,610
to the corner.
Well,

2151
01:45:33,611 --> 01:45:36,480
you know the coolest recent one.
It is crazy.

2152
01:45:36,590 --> 01:45:40,400
Some noise from this motherfucker.
Just give me a little bit.

2153
01:45:45,360 --> 01:45:46,193
That is dmt music.
I know if you're tripping balls and 

2154
01:45:49,231 --> 01:45:52,380
somebody plays that you,
it'll take you to a new dimension.

2155
01:45:52,650 --> 01:45:53,483
So you've never accessed was kind of 
like the paint on for it to and 

2156
01:45:55,081 --> 01:45:55,570
everything.
Oh,

2157
01:45:55,570 --> 01:45:57,030
that's not true.
Actually.

2158
01:45:57,031 --> 01:45:57,864
It's quite interesting.
The center center diamond church around 

2159
01:46:00,691 --> 01:46:01,524
the IOWASCA stuff has a lot of really 
interesting music to listen to it 

2160
01:46:04,471 --> 01:46:06,860
straight is the kind of mind mind 
blowing.

2161
01:46:06,960 --> 01:46:07,830
Well,
there's also,

2162
01:46:07,831 --> 01:46:08,664
there's,
I don't know if it's that one or the 

2163
01:46:10,350 --> 01:46:11,183
something do vegetal.
There's one of those similar Christian 

2164
01:46:13,471 --> 01:46:14,304
based dimethyltryptamine Iowasca type 
churches that they sing songs about 

2165
01:46:18,991 --> 01:46:19,824
Jesus the trip balls and sing songs 
about Jesus and what's really weird 

2166
01:46:24,721 --> 01:46:29,100
about dmt in particular,
and I guess you could say the same of of

2167
01:46:29,130 --> 01:46:29,963
mushrooms,
but mushrooms apparently when it 

2168
01:46:31,741 --> 01:46:32,970
synthesizes.
Yeah,

2169
01:46:33,120 --> 01:46:38,120
it's real similar in chemical content to
what dimethyltryptamine is.

2170
01:46:38,850 --> 01:46:41,130
I'm going to fuck this up,
but I think it's an n.

2171
01:46:41,131 --> 01:46:41,964
dimethyltryptamine is dimethyltryptamine
and then when it's synthesized by the 

2172
01:46:45,841 --> 01:46:46,674
body,
when the body processes silicide than I 

2173
01:46:49,951 --> 01:46:53,180
think it produces something called for 
Fox for a lock.

2174
01:46:53,190 --> 01:46:56,520
CNN dimethyltryptamine,
I think it's real close.

2175
01:46:56,580 --> 01:46:59,850
I might have fucked that up,
but I think it's so close that it's like

2176
01:46:59,851 --> 01:47:00,910
their cousins.
Okay,

2177
01:47:01,320 --> 01:47:05,130
so there's something about music in 
these things and one of the best ways to

2178
01:47:05,131 --> 01:47:05,964
get out of a trip if you're,
if you're really tripping balls with 

2179
01:47:07,921 --> 01:47:09,930
mushrooms,
is the sing your way out of it.

2180
01:47:10,410 --> 01:47:11,243
You can sing your way out of a bad trip.
You can actually control the trip with 

2181
01:47:14,131 --> 01:47:14,964
good music.
And one of the things that's really 

2182
01:47:17,911 --> 01:47:18,744
constant with Dmt is these arrows that 
these shaman will sing and these egos 

2183
01:47:25,380 --> 01:47:26,213
with symbols and like a little bit of 
drum and these like really rhythmic 

2184
01:47:31,321 --> 01:47:32,260
singing it.

2185
01:47:32,360 --> 01:47:33,193
It makes the hallucination dance in like
a really obvious tangible way moves 

2186
01:47:38,821 --> 01:47:42,780
around itself and it changes in guides 
the trip.

2187
01:47:42,930 --> 01:47:45,680
Well that's what I.
my hypothesis has been that it's sort of

2188
01:47:45,780 --> 01:47:46,500
some sort of.
Yeah,

2189
01:47:46,500 --> 01:47:51,300
I guess that's one right there.
This is one of personally experienced.

2190
01:47:51,600 --> 01:47:52,433
I've,
I've actually tripped listening to this 

2191
01:47:53,821 --> 01:47:58,080
song and it was like these geometric 
patterns,

2192
01:47:58,081 --> 01:47:59,730
these entities that seem to be 
conscious,

2193
01:48:00,030 --> 01:48:02,460
they were like moving around.
This is the guy,

2194
01:48:02,461 --> 01:48:06,420
this is the Iowa scarecrow,
this is the shaman blowing tobacco,

2195
01:48:06,421 --> 01:48:09,390
this is part of the ritual.
They actually below tobacco on you,

2196
01:48:09,720 --> 01:48:11,010
why you you do that?

2197
01:48:17,020 --> 01:48:21,610
So this guy was just this little rattle 
and singing and sometimes there's actual

2198
01:48:21,611 --> 01:48:22,444
singing,
not just whistling but in their 

2199
01:48:25,511 --> 01:48:27,880
language,
this beautiful soft,

2200
01:48:27,881 --> 01:48:32,290
rhythmic sort of song and the 
hallucinations dance to this,

2201
01:48:32,470 --> 01:48:33,303
to the sound of this music.
Like they're supposed to dance to it 

2202
01:48:35,591 --> 01:48:36,424
like they're a part of like it's not 
just that you're having music on top of 

2203
01:48:40,361 --> 01:48:42,670
the psychedelic experience,
but that they merge,

2204
01:48:42,730 --> 01:48:43,563
they merge and the psychedelic 
experience experience is a hundred 

2205
01:48:46,331 --> 01:48:47,164
percent affected by this.
So it's not just that there's chemicals 

2206
01:48:50,651 --> 01:48:54,550
that are interacting with your brain,
your doing something to by responding to

2207
01:48:54,551 --> 01:48:55,384
that music and then the music is doing 
something by enhancing the way your 

2208
01:48:58,391 --> 01:48:59,224
perception of this experience is and all
of that is dancing together like they 

2209
01:49:02,201 --> 01:49:04,780
belong together.
It's fascinating shit.

2210
01:49:05,390 --> 01:49:06,223
Yeah.
I mean my hypothesis has been that the 

2211
01:49:08,681 --> 01:49:13,540
music acts as a prosthesis to sort of 
lock you in because the experience is so

2212
01:49:13,541 --> 01:49:14,374
powerful.

2213
01:49:15,010 --> 01:49:15,910
Yeah.
I mean,

2214
01:49:15,911 --> 01:49:20,220
maybe it's always a little bit weird,
you know,

2215
01:49:20,230 --> 01:49:21,063
try to imagine somebody says,
do you want a glass of scotch and a 

2216
01:49:23,351 --> 01:49:25,340
shaman to go with it,
what?

2217
01:49:26,050 --> 01:49:26,883
You probably need one,
but you know someone at a bar that's 

2218
01:49:28,920 --> 01:49:30,880
like,
we're going to drink this,

2219
01:49:30,910 --> 01:49:31,743
we're going to drink this good 
intentions and no one's going to be 

2220
01:49:33,581 --> 01:49:36,100
grabbing anybody's Dick.
No one's no one's going and said,

2221
01:49:36,670 --> 01:49:39,130
no one's getting rude here.
There would be no wedgies,

2222
01:49:39,520 --> 01:49:40,780
right?
There'd be nothing.

2223
01:49:40,781 --> 01:49:42,760
Nothing rude will be said.
You will.

2224
01:49:42,761 --> 01:49:43,594
You will think for a good solid five 
seconds before any hasty moves like 

2225
01:49:47,231 --> 01:49:47,920
let's,
let's,

2226
01:49:47,920 --> 01:49:48,160
let's

2227
01:49:48,160 --> 01:49:48,993
understand that I let it get great 
benefit going to get great benefit from 

2228
01:49:51,491 --> 01:49:55,370
this in terms of our ability to be loose
and to be silly and to,

2229
01:49:55,540 --> 01:49:57,480
to enjoy each other's company.
But if,

2230
01:49:57,670 --> 01:49:58,503
if a demon comes out during this time,
you must address this demon personally 

2231
01:50:02,290 --> 01:50:05,290
on your own.
Don't pull the demon out and throw it at

2232
01:50:05,291 --> 01:50:06,880
the party.
Right?

2233
01:50:06,940 --> 01:50:08,040
This is good stuff.
That's,

2234
01:50:08,050 --> 01:50:10,180
but that's what happened.
So that drunks,

2235
01:50:10,181 --> 01:50:11,330
the throne,
that dementia,

2236
01:50:11,360 --> 01:50:12,193
that,
that thing where they figured out that 

2237
01:50:13,121 --> 01:50:13,954
if you put a worm in the mescal stuff,
that would be a great marketing device 

2238
01:50:17,141 --> 01:50:18,250
north of the border.
Right?

2239
01:50:18,860 --> 01:50:21,730
Cause you just tell some stories.
So now we were going to open that.

2240
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:25,110
What that is is just think it's a 
marketing gimmick next and then.

2241
01:50:25,220 --> 01:50:29,860
And then what we do is we found our own 
Tequila company and we only so exclusive

2242
01:50:29,861 --> 01:50:34,300
that you can only buy it if you also 
hire a charlotte for the event will make

2243
01:50:34,301 --> 01:50:34,810
tons of money.

2244
01:50:34,810 --> 01:50:35,381
Yeah.
And if.

2245
01:50:35,381 --> 01:50:37,930
What if the,
the worm actually was psychedelic.

2246
01:50:38,140 --> 01:50:38,973
Like what if there was a way we can 
genetically engineer a worm to be 

2247
01:50:42,581 --> 01:50:43,414
intensely psychedelic.
Like the worm literally is made out of 

2248
01:50:45,611 --> 01:50:49,300
Iowasca like we.
Why don't we put a toad in the misco?

2249
01:50:49,540 --> 01:50:50,373
Well don't they do weird shit like that 
with a little take tomatoes and they'll 

2250
01:50:53,691 --> 01:50:57,340
like use [inaudible] frog DNA in the 
tomato to make it live longer.

2251
01:50:57,720 --> 01:50:59,500
But isn't.
There was some weird shit.

2252
01:50:59,520 --> 01:51:00,880
They're already dealing with.
Cool stuff.

2253
01:51:00,881 --> 01:51:01,714
Is the green fluorescent protein stuff 
you can have glow in the dark rabbits 

2254
01:51:04,480 --> 01:51:06,550
and he makes these.
Yes.

2255
01:51:06,610 --> 01:51:08,430
Yes.
Let's get some glow in the dark bunnies,

2256
01:51:08,440 --> 01:51:09,273
man.
They can do that right there is 

2257
01:51:10,691 --> 01:51:11,530
something like that.
Right?

2258
01:51:11,800 --> 01:51:14,620
So you have Jamie,
do you have glow in the dark rabbits?

2259
01:51:14,890 --> 01:51:15,723
No,
but I do have the genetically modified 

2260
01:51:16,721 --> 01:51:21,721
potato with frog genes to resist 
pathogens while in the holy fuck.

2261
01:51:23,410 --> 01:51:24,243
So how weird is that?
GM potato uses frog gene to resist 

2262
01:51:29,541 --> 01:51:30,610
pathogen.
So that's,

2263
01:51:30,870 --> 01:51:32,610
that's real.
Can we do.

2264
01:51:33,050 --> 01:51:35,750
Can we do a GFP rabbits?

2265
01:51:35,970 --> 01:51:36,803
Yep.

2266
01:51:37,460 --> 01:51:38,293
So what were we on before this?
We were talking about how we get to 

2267
01:51:40,031 --> 01:51:43,130
rabbits.
Tequila with a fraudulent.

2268
01:51:43,220 --> 01:51:48,220
So what if we engineer that little worm 
to be like a 100 percent dmt,

2269
01:51:49,300 --> 01:51:50,133
100 percent dsd where you get down to 
that worm and whoever chugs to the 

2270
01:51:53,271 --> 01:51:58,271
bottom and choose on that warm.
Just call you immediately transformed.

2271
01:52:00,771 --> 01:52:04,190
What the fuck am I watching?
These are these glowing rabbits.

2272
01:52:04,191 --> 01:52:05,990
Yeah.
That is so weird dude.

2273
01:52:06,200 --> 01:52:08,840
It's so weird.
Hoverboards and archery stuff.

2274
01:52:08,870 --> 01:52:10,140
We need rabbits.
Who need.

2275
01:52:10,360 --> 01:52:11,810
Now here's a problem,
man.

2276
01:52:11,930 --> 01:52:14,540
My kids have rabbits in there.
Those rabbits,

2277
01:52:14,541 --> 01:52:15,950
a little assholes.
They don't.

2278
01:52:16,120 --> 01:52:20,330
They don't give a fuck about each other.
We have two of them is so rude.

2279
01:52:20,420 --> 01:52:21,920
This is what happens.
They're both males,

2280
01:52:21,921 --> 01:52:24,320
unfortunately.
Here's what happens when you get to mail

2281
01:52:24,321 --> 01:52:26,450
bunnies and you put them in a gigantic 
chicken coop.

2282
01:52:26,720 --> 01:52:27,553
They fuck each other up.
It's bunny UFC everyday with these 

2283
01:52:30,741 --> 01:52:33,860
little assholes.
All they do is kick each other's ass.

2284
01:52:34,010 --> 01:52:37,700
They chase each other around this 
chicken coop and when they get a hold of

2285
01:52:37,701 --> 01:52:38,534
each other,
they bite each other and they kick each 

2286
01:52:39,771 --> 01:52:40,604
other.
They fuck each other up because they're 

2287
01:52:42,381 --> 01:52:43,214
both boys and they don't want a boy to 
be running as these two bunnies fucking 

2288
01:52:46,371 --> 01:52:47,300
each other out.
Dude,

2289
01:52:47,301 --> 01:52:48,134
this is what they do.
Bunnies are fucking ruthless to each 

2290
01:52:51,021 --> 01:52:51,854
other.
These two little assholes just chase 

2291
01:52:53,421 --> 01:52:56,660
each other all day long and beat the 
shit out of each other.

2292
01:52:56,930 --> 01:52:59,660
That's all they do.
Why don't you do commentary?

2293
01:53:00,260 --> 01:53:01,580
I'm not gonna.
I'm not gonna.

2294
01:53:01,581 --> 01:53:03,180
Encourage their batteries.
Ballard,

2295
01:53:03,220 --> 01:53:05,840
comment.
One of them is actually missing.

2296
01:53:06,280 --> 01:53:07,520
Um,
so here's what happened.

2297
01:53:07,880 --> 01:53:10,700
We are chicken coop burnt down from the 
fire,

2298
01:53:10,730 --> 01:53:13,400
but the chicken survived.
One of them got scorched.

2299
01:53:13,400 --> 01:53:15,800
They all got fucking PTSD.
It's crazy.

2300
01:53:15,801 --> 01:53:18,320
I go near them,
but they're alive.

2301
01:53:18,610 --> 01:53:20,570
Right.
So we had a maneuver them and move them.

2302
01:53:20,600 --> 01:53:24,380
But one bunnies missing found one bunny.
One bunnies missing.

2303
01:53:24,381 --> 01:53:26,570
So I think it's better for the one bunny
that survived.

2304
01:53:26,880 --> 01:53:27,713
And the one bunny that probably got 
jacked by an eagle or some shit like 

2305
01:53:29,691 --> 01:53:31,730
that.
That's a wraps on you had a good life.

2306
01:53:32,030 --> 01:53:35,150
He beat the shit out of your friend for 
a year and a half solid.

2307
01:53:35,151 --> 01:53:35,984
Just kick each other's ass.
It's fucking horrible that his ears are 

2308
01:53:37,911 --> 01:53:40,370
totally jacked up to hear the shredded.
Like a,

2309
01:53:40,400 --> 01:53:42,470
like an old bag to the depth that you 
missed?

2310
01:53:43,250 --> 01:53:44,870
I don't think so because there's no 
body.

2311
01:53:45,330 --> 01:53:46,163
I think.
I think a bunny got out and it probably 

2312
01:53:47,631 --> 01:53:50,360
ran away or who knows what the fuck 
happened at Coyote got it.

2313
01:53:50,361 --> 01:53:52,550
Or some shit.
I mean there's a lot of hawks,

2314
01:53:52,610 --> 01:53:54,050
lot of hawks in my neighborhood.

2315
01:53:54,080 --> 01:53:55,720
It's most likely a hawk.
Yeah.

2316
01:53:56,060 --> 01:53:56,893
But whatever.
There's one little bunnies by himself 

2317
01:53:59,091 --> 01:54:00,980
now.
He's like the other asshole.

2318
01:54:01,400 --> 01:54:03,830
They're both assholes to each other.
It's not like one good bunny.

2319
01:54:04,160 --> 01:54:06,080
They just find each other and like,
fuck you.

2320
01:54:06,170 --> 01:54:08,990
I imagined just that's all you do for 
years.

2321
01:54:09,410 --> 01:54:10,243
That's bunny life.
You get to male buddies together and 

2322
01:54:12,351 --> 01:54:14,300
everyday is fuck you.
Fuck you.

2323
01:54:14,420 --> 01:54:15,253
Fuck yeah.
With they run at each other and one 

2324
01:54:17,631 --> 01:54:20,210
one's always trying to get away.
One's always trying to eat and the other

2325
01:54:20,211 --> 01:54:22,250
one jumped on him and start biting him 
and kicking him.

2326
01:54:22,251 --> 01:54:23,900
And the other one we'll do the same and 
they'll rotate.

2327
01:54:23,920 --> 01:54:25,160
You know,
it's very funny.

2328
01:54:25,161 --> 01:54:28,280
The uh,
the last two Jews in Afghanistan,

2329
01:54:28,960 --> 01:54:30,880
uh,
both had to live in the synagogue.

2330
01:54:30,890 --> 01:54:33,150
That was all the head left.
That's really only help somebody.

2331
01:54:33,260 --> 01:54:34,093
Somebody went,
somebody went to go visit the last two 

2332
01:54:36,630 --> 01:54:40,010
Jews in Afghanistan and said like,
why aren't you,

2333
01:54:40,040 --> 01:54:41,120
why aren't you guys friends?

2334
01:54:41,290 --> 01:54:42,123
And one of them says here,
I'll show you his small want to have 

2335
01:54:46,221 --> 01:54:47,390
lunch.
The got the guy says,

2336
01:54:47,460 --> 01:54:50,060
grow up.
Did you see what I'm working with?

2337
01:54:50,270 --> 01:54:53,060
And it's like the most Jewish 
conversation between the last two Jews,

2338
01:54:53,061 --> 01:54:55,100
they can't get along.
And so they're like the two rabbits that

2339
01:54:55,101 --> 01:54:56,720
the,
all the others went away,

2340
01:54:56,870 --> 01:54:59,930
whether they're probably really horny 
and lonely and confused,

2341
01:54:59,960 --> 01:55:00,850
I suppose.
Yeah.

2342
01:55:00,870 --> 01:55:01,611
I mean,
what the fuck?

2343
01:55:01,611 --> 01:55:04,200
There's only two of them.
They need to get to Israel stat like,

2344
01:55:04,201 --> 01:55:05,180
well,
I think one of them died.

2345
01:55:05,181 --> 01:55:08,420
And then the last one is just despite 
the last guy,

2346
01:55:09,710 --> 01:55:10,543
someone talked to him.
If it's possible for you to get to 

2347
01:55:12,801 --> 01:55:14,540
Jerusalem,
that's your people,

2348
01:55:14,690 --> 01:55:16,190
they'll just,
you'll have a party over there.

2349
01:55:16,191 --> 01:55:17,960
Everything will be great.
Jewish food,

2350
01:55:18,680 --> 01:55:19,513
everyone's speaking Hebrew.
Everyone's united will like the last 

2351
01:55:22,221 --> 01:55:23,300
three Jews have.
Carola.

2352
01:55:23,301 --> 01:55:25,130
Was this young woman and two guys.

2353
01:55:25,230 --> 01:55:26,470
Just that.
No,

2354
01:55:26,510 --> 01:55:29,560
neither one of you forget this thing.
I know.

2355
01:55:29,570 --> 01:55:30,260
It's rough,
man.

2356
01:55:30,260 --> 01:55:31,093
It's rough.
It's crazy to think that it's a country 

2357
01:55:32,331 --> 01:55:35,990
with zero Jews like zero.
Yeah,

2358
01:55:36,130 --> 01:55:36,950
yeah,
yeah.

2359
01:55:36,950 --> 01:55:38,690
Nope.
The whole country like,

2360
01:55:38,691 --> 01:55:39,530
Whoa,
whoa.

2361
01:55:39,580 --> 01:55:42,470
That is.
That is kind of this melting pot here,

2362
01:55:42,471 --> 01:55:43,410
sir.
Zero,

2363
01:55:43,440 --> 01:55:46,140
zero melting.
It was one ingredient,

2364
01:55:46,590 --> 01:55:48,210
whole pot.
That's all stu.

2365
01:55:48,260 --> 01:55:49,270
I'd say it.
It was.

2366
01:55:49,320 --> 01:55:50,153
The Taliban actually really needed the 
Jewish community because they wanted to 

2367
01:55:52,531 --> 01:55:53,364
be able to say,
we've had great relations with 

2368
01:55:54,511 --> 01:55:57,060
Afghanistan Jewish community.
They just didn't say it was two guys,

2369
01:55:57,930 --> 01:55:59,940
two dudes that hate each other.
Exactly.

2370
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:02,040
Very polarizing.
True.

2371
01:56:02,280 --> 01:56:03,450
I don't know how we got into.
Oh,

2372
01:56:03,460 --> 01:56:05,490
glowing bunnies.
I'm not getting any fucking bunnies,

2373
01:56:05,491 --> 01:56:06,920
man.
All right.

2374
01:56:06,980 --> 01:56:09,300
If you get a guy and a girl together,
you've got to fix the girl.

2375
01:56:09,301 --> 01:56:10,134
Otherwise you're going to have a million
bunnies and they're all going to be 

2376
01:56:11,251 --> 01:56:12,300
kicking each other's asses.

2377
01:56:12,680 --> 01:56:15,040
So they do the bunny apocalypse.
Well,

2378
01:56:15,140 --> 01:56:20,140
what's really fucked up his reading 
about animals that that fight like right

2379
01:56:21,630 --> 01:56:25,100
out of the womb,
how they kill their partner.

2380
01:56:25,110 --> 01:56:27,050
They killed the good siblicide.
Yeah.

2381
01:56:28,050 --> 01:56:32,910
Pull up a obligate siblicide in blue.
Nazca could boobies.

2382
01:56:33,660 --> 01:56:36,270
What of those?
What's it in Nazca.

2383
01:56:36,271 --> 01:56:39,180
Booby.
They live in the Nazca lines or these.

2384
01:56:39,210 --> 01:56:42,360
What are these boobies?
Jamie Hmi out here.

2385
01:56:42,361 --> 01:56:44,430
We're hanging out in the word Boobie 
Boobie.

2386
01:56:44,450 --> 01:56:45,840
I'm still still.
How do you spell that?

2387
01:56:46,460 --> 01:56:49,710
Naz,
ca and then boobies.

2388
01:56:49,711 --> 01:56:50,544
The usual man.
I'm trying to remember what I was 

2389
01:56:53,460 --> 01:56:57,750
reading about where obligate siblicide 
when one animal comes out,

2390
01:56:57,751 --> 01:56:59,520
the other one tries to kill the other 
one.

2391
01:56:59,521 --> 01:57:02,010
Almost immediately.
Hostile Hyenas,

2392
01:57:02,760 --> 01:57:04,500
hyenas,
hyenas.

2393
01:57:04,501 --> 01:57:05,334
There's been.
There's been evidence of hyenas 

2394
01:57:08,671 --> 01:57:13,671
attacking their sibling while it's in 
the amniotic sack and theirs.

2395
01:57:14,520 --> 01:57:15,353
When they come out,
the bigger one or the stronger one of 

2396
01:57:17,671 --> 01:57:21,800
the whatever one's healthy will almost 
immediately started attacking it.

2397
01:57:21,800 --> 01:57:25,350
Sibling and try to kill it.
Pull up that if that's true,

2398
01:57:25,800 --> 01:57:27,340
I'm pretty sure that's true,
but I want to see.

2399
01:57:27,520 --> 01:57:28,353
Boom.
I went to this crazy rabbit hole about 

2400
01:57:30,331 --> 01:57:35,070
hyenas recently.
What a bizarre animal that is.

2401
01:57:35,071 --> 01:57:37,340
So this the false penis?
Yeah.

2402
01:57:37,350 --> 01:57:39,150
The false penis is just one aspect.
Yeah.

2403
01:57:39,151 --> 01:57:39,871
Everything.
Everything.

2404
01:57:39,871 --> 01:57:42,300
About 90 percent of the women die.
Okay.

2405
01:57:42,301 --> 01:57:43,360
Here it goes.
Obligate symbols,

2406
01:57:43,730 --> 01:57:44,563
similar size.
When a sibling almost always ends up 

2407
01:57:46,051 --> 01:57:46,884
being killed.
Fugitive siblicide means the suicide 

2408
01:57:50,110 --> 01:57:50,943
facul Tim,
like it's a choice versus you've got to 

2409
01:57:53,491 --> 01:57:57,360
do a tative.
Faculty tackled facultative syllabus.

2410
01:57:57,361 --> 01:57:58,194
Siblicide means a siblicide may or may 
not occur based on environmental 

2411
01:58:00,451 --> 01:58:01,710
conditions.
Okay,

2412
01:58:02,190 --> 01:58:05,490
so it's sometimes will happen if there's
not enough resources.

2413
01:58:05,870 --> 01:58:09,220
So the idea is that the,
the breeding cycle is retired,

2414
01:58:09,260 --> 01:58:10,093
so you either make it or you don't.
And so the danger of laying one egg and 

2415
01:58:13,591 --> 01:58:16,650
having it not work out is very,
oh,

2416
01:58:16,651 --> 01:58:17,560
this bird is fucking.

2417
01:58:17,560 --> 01:58:20,670
This is brother up and it has to be in 
front of mom and dad because you want to

2418
01:58:20,671 --> 01:58:23,310
prove that you're worthy.
Well that is insane,

2419
01:58:23,340 --> 01:58:24,173
right?
So Mommy,

2420
01:58:24,210 --> 01:58:25,710
look at,
he's beating it to death.

2421
01:58:25,860 --> 01:58:27,630
So this is because there's not enough 
food,

2422
01:58:27,750 --> 01:58:30,120
there's not enough food to do two.
So the first one,

2423
01:58:30,690 --> 01:58:34,290
the second one is a spare and the first 
one proves,

2424
01:58:34,350 --> 01:58:36,990
proves that he's worthy by killing his 
sibling.

2425
01:58:37,050 --> 01:58:39,300
The spare in front of the parents and 
says,

2426
01:58:39,301 --> 01:58:40,620
yeah,
you can invest in me.

2427
01:58:40,800 --> 01:58:42,130
I got this thing,
Jesus Christ.

2428
01:58:42,131 --> 01:58:45,790
And what kind of bird is this is 
probably Nazca or blue footed boobies is

2429
01:58:45,791 --> 01:58:47,500
my guess.
That is insane.

2430
01:58:47,501 --> 01:58:49,120
That is insane.
It's hard to watch.

2431
01:58:49,150 --> 01:58:50,680
Well,
this is what I said about biology.

2432
01:58:50,980 --> 01:58:54,400
Biology cares about your feelings and 
the mom doesn't give a fuck about her.

2433
01:58:54,401 --> 01:58:56,170
I don't know the mom the mom wants.

2434
01:58:56,260 --> 01:58:58,000
Look,
mom's excited.

2435
01:58:58,001 --> 01:59:00,820
This one's dying fucked up,
and the mom's like,

2436
01:59:00,960 --> 01:59:02,060
mom's excited.
Hey,

2437
01:59:02,070 --> 01:59:04,420
the older one knows what it's doing.
He's viable.

2438
01:59:04,570 --> 01:59:06,700
Jesus Christ.
Nature is pretty brutal,

2439
01:59:07,180 --> 01:59:08,950
pretty brutal.
Now it's,

2440
01:59:08,970 --> 01:59:12,100
it's bizarre seeing this from,
Oh God,

2441
01:59:12,101 --> 01:59:13,510
I don't want to see this thing slowly 
die,

2442
01:59:13,511 --> 01:59:15,520
dude.
It's bizarre seeing it from birds.

2443
01:59:15,521 --> 01:59:15,971
But,
uh,

2444
01:59:15,971 --> 01:59:18,340
I think it's even more ruthless the way 
lions,

2445
01:59:18,790 --> 01:59:21,130
hyenas,
hyenas killing their siblings,

2446
01:59:21,790 --> 01:59:22,623
that almost a,
I think they were saying it's pretty 

2447
01:59:24,191 --> 01:59:25,950
universal.
That is when the first one comes out and

2448
01:59:25,951 --> 01:59:27,570
they tried to kill a second one with,
you know,

2449
01:59:27,571 --> 01:59:28,404
this thing about lion female lions 
getting excited by the murder of their 

2450
01:59:30,881 --> 01:59:32,480
children.
Oh,

2451
01:59:32,920 --> 01:59:35,740
so when the new,
when the new mail takes over the pride,

2452
01:59:36,670 --> 01:59:37,503
his first order of business may be,
let's stop wasting resources on the 

2453
01:59:41,110 --> 01:59:41,943
previous daddy's a offspring.
So what happens through this same kind 

2454
01:59:46,991 --> 01:59:47,824
of thing?
The hyena gets out and immediately 

2455
01:59:49,960 --> 01:59:50,793
starts killing its sibling.
They're fighting to the death right out 

2456
01:59:53,741 --> 01:59:54,574
of the womb.
Look at this fucking mad battle as 

2457
01:59:56,681 --> 01:59:57,514
babies.
Look,

2458
01:59:57,600 --> 02:00:01,180
it's still got the sack on it and 
they're just trying to kill each other.

2459
02:00:03,530 --> 02:00:06,480
This is a particularly ruthless animal.
There were.

2460
02:00:06,580 --> 02:00:11,580
There were saying that 60 percent of 
hyenas die as a trying to get out of the

2461
02:00:12,591 --> 02:00:13,610
tube.
Wow.

2462
02:00:15,120 --> 02:00:16,350
What?
I didn't know that.

2463
02:00:16,440 --> 02:00:18,000
Yeah,
20 percent of women die.

2464
02:00:18,320 --> 02:00:20,850
Whether females rather die when they're 
giving birth,

2465
02:00:21,260 --> 02:00:23,880
but that's because of our crazy brain to
body ratio.

2466
02:00:24,480 --> 02:00:26,690
They have no female hyenas.
Oh,

2467
02:00:27,090 --> 02:00:28,560
giant Dick.
Sorry.

2468
02:00:28,561 --> 02:00:32,220
I thought you were talking about high 
rates of human mentality.

2469
02:00:32,370 --> 02:00:33,203
Female Hyena die 20 percent of the time 
when they're giving birth because the 

2470
02:00:36,601 --> 02:00:39,240
baby doesn't come out right.
Like they have this crazy,

2471
02:00:39,270 --> 02:00:42,070
you know they have a penis that is 
actually a vagina.

2472
02:00:42,071 --> 02:00:43,620
It's a.
it's an enormous,

2473
02:00:43,920 --> 02:00:46,860
huge and gorge clearest.
It's far bigger than the males.

2474
02:00:47,040 --> 02:00:49,470
They have to pull it back so the male 
can copulate with them,

2475
02:00:49,471 --> 02:00:53,010
but then when they give birth he has to 
come out of that Dick and they don't.

2476
02:00:53,011 --> 02:00:55,450
It doesn't always come out right,
so system.

2477
02:00:55,490 --> 02:00:56,323
Yeah,
Google that because I might be wrong 

2478
02:00:58,501 --> 02:00:59,334
about the numbers,
but it's some exorbitant number of 

2479
02:01:01,320 --> 02:01:03,810
babies die and a huge number of women.

2480
02:01:04,290 --> 02:01:05,250
Women.
I keep saying women,

2481
02:01:05,520 --> 02:01:06,890
female,
Hyena is done.

2482
02:01:07,180 --> 02:01:08,013
Yeah.
That's why I fuck up,

2483
02:01:08,310 --> 02:01:09,143
but there are also weird and that 
they're way bigger than the males and 

2484
02:01:11,641 --> 02:01:13,860
that's the because the males won't let 
the babies eat,

2485
02:01:14,250 --> 02:01:17,430
so this one of the things they think 
like if somethings are scavengers,

2486
02:01:17,431 --> 02:01:19,290
the males are trying to push out 
everything smaller.

2487
02:01:19,380 --> 02:01:22,530
So because of that the females have to 
get in and go fuck off.

2488
02:01:22,531 --> 02:01:25,340
The kid has to eat like even if it's 
their kid that's cool.

2489
02:01:25,650 --> 02:01:28,110
Sixty percent suffocate on their way 
out.

2490
02:01:28,680 --> 02:01:30,420
Sixty percent of them die on the way 
out.

2491
02:01:30,690 --> 02:01:31,523
Yeah,
and I think it's 20 percent of the 

2492
02:01:32,791 --> 02:01:36,270
females die during childbirth as well.
Pretty sure.

2493
02:01:36,360 --> 02:01:38,850
That's what I read,
which is fucking.

2494
02:01:39,950 --> 02:01:41,630
I mean,
60 percent though.

2495
02:01:41,720 --> 02:01:45,920
Imagine 60 percent of all kids die on 
the way out and then the ones that don't

2496
02:01:45,921 --> 02:01:46,940
die,
if you got two of them,

2497
02:01:46,941 --> 02:01:47,870
one of them kills the other one.

2498
02:01:49,290 --> 02:01:50,880
It's a rough neighborhood.
Oh,

2499
02:01:51,890 --> 02:01:54,950
it's a matriarchal society and they give
birth through that fake penis.

2500
02:01:55,010 --> 02:01:55,870
Yeah,
that's what I'm saying.

2501
02:01:56,380 --> 02:01:59,480
What is the purpose of the fake penis?
What does take peanuts is a dominate the

2502
02:01:59,481 --> 02:02:01,460
men.
They get on top of the band and they go,

2503
02:02:01,490 --> 02:02:02,390
listen,
bitch,

2504
02:02:02,391 --> 02:02:05,150
so it's going to be.
And they got a big old strap on.

2505
02:02:05,180 --> 02:02:07,970
They pegged their men at all.
Male hyenas are cooks.

2506
02:02:08,600 --> 02:02:10,070
They all take.
It's crazy.

2507
02:02:10,100 --> 02:02:10,933
It's crazy.
That's where we're heading as a 

2508
02:02:11,390 --> 02:02:12,560
condition.
Diameter.

2509
02:02:13,280 --> 02:02:15,170
Really?
Jesus.

2510
02:02:15,620 --> 02:02:17,290
Ouch.
Tight squeeze that.

2511
02:02:17,450 --> 02:02:19,790
That creates a high death rate for first
time mothers.

2512
02:02:19,820 --> 02:02:21,530
Yeah.
High death rate is and say here,

2513
02:02:21,531 --> 02:02:23,180
how many.
But I think it's 20 percent.

2514
02:02:23,710 --> 02:02:25,020
You've ever seen the,
the,

2515
02:02:25,210 --> 02:02:28,000
uh,
like the full human cliteracy?

2516
02:02:28,190 --> 02:02:29,180
Yes.
I've seen one.

2517
02:02:30,020 --> 02:02:32,080
Have you?
Uh,

2518
02:02:32,090 --> 02:02:34,100
not in the wild.
The full,

2519
02:02:34,130 --> 02:02:35,130
the full clitoral.
No,

2520
02:02:35,131 --> 02:02:35,500
I know.

2521
02:02:35,500 --> 02:02:37,490
I've never seen it.
Like a biological.

2522
02:02:37,550 --> 02:02:40,880
Can you pull up the internal clutters 
internal clinic?

2523
02:02:41,290 --> 02:02:42,123
I think it was only discovered.
Is it not allowed to be shown to 

2524
02:02:44,210 --> 02:02:45,320
quickly?
Think about that.

2525
02:02:45,590 --> 02:02:46,940
Yeah.
It'll cause trouble.

2526
02:02:47,370 --> 02:02:49,160
Well,
you could pull it up and just don't show

2527
02:02:49,161 --> 02:02:52,070
the world.
Just show us if you.

2528
02:02:52,100 --> 02:02:55,640
I think if you put that on Youtube,
we will be monetized and possibly kicked

2529
02:02:55,641 --> 02:02:57,230
off their network to Google that 
yourself.

2530
02:02:57,290 --> 02:02:58,280
Yeah,
Google it.

2531
02:02:58,281 --> 02:03:00,850
You weirdo and be careful of the wrath 
of the government.

2532
02:03:00,920 --> 02:03:04,250
Enormous structure that I think we 
didn't fully understand.

2533
02:03:04,251 --> 02:03:05,840
I don't understand how we could have 
missed it,

2534
02:03:06,380 --> 02:03:07,213
but my understanding was we didn't fully
understand the internal cliteracy there 

2535
02:03:12,590 --> 02:03:16,250
on the left below.
It looks exactly like this sort of space

2536
02:03:16,460 --> 02:03:21,050
ships from war of the worlds 1953.
It's all that stuff on the outside.

2537
02:03:21,590 --> 02:03:24,130
All you see on the outside,
that little tip at the top,

2538
02:03:24,440 --> 02:03:25,280
we're going to get in trouble.

2539
02:03:26,440 --> 02:03:29,450
They get mad at us.
Does that picture make you horny?

2540
02:03:29,800 --> 02:03:31,250
No,
not at all.

2541
02:03:31,610 --> 02:03:32,480
Afraid,
doesn't it?

2542
02:03:32,660 --> 02:03:36,140
It seems like an alien.
I should shoot laser blogger like that's

2543
02:03:36,141 --> 02:03:39,050
the Ridley Scott Alien.
The face hugger.

2544
02:03:40,900 --> 02:03:42,000
Yeah.
Well,

2545
02:03:42,001 --> 02:03:42,834
just the look.
It's very weird that we've just come to 

2546
02:03:44,601 --> 02:03:48,380
accept what the shape of the body.
His body is very bizarre.

2547
02:03:48,590 --> 02:03:51,560
I mean if we were all shaped like sting 
rays and we saw a person,

2548
02:03:51,561 --> 02:03:52,394
we'd be like,
what in the holy fuck is that thing 

2549
02:03:54,770 --> 02:03:55,603
with?
It's articulating fingers and it's 

2550
02:03:57,410 --> 02:03:58,310
moving.
It's eyeballs,

2551
02:03:58,311 --> 02:04:00,140
rounds,
sniffing things,

2552
02:04:00,141 --> 02:04:00,974
but its nostrils.
Like we just accept the fact that this 

2553
02:04:02,871 --> 02:04:04,910
shape is,
is normal,

2554
02:04:04,940 --> 02:04:05,990
that it makes sense.
Well,

2555
02:04:05,991 --> 02:04:06,824
this is why cephalopods from last time 
when we were talking about the 

2556
02:04:08,940 --> 02:04:09,920
cuttlefish.
Yeah.

2557
02:04:10,100 --> 02:04:11,780
My,
I just learned something new,

2558
02:04:11,781 --> 02:04:16,781
which is the cephalopods are under 
consideration to be the next great model

2559
02:04:16,821 --> 02:04:18,380
organism for biology.

2560
02:04:18,980 --> 02:04:19,813
So if you think about how weird it is 
that some branch of the phylogenetic 

2561
02:04:23,001 --> 02:04:23,834
tree is so far distant from us that 
these mollusks have such advanced minds 

2562
02:04:27,561 --> 02:04:28,394
and you know,
their skin is the wonder of the world 

2563
02:04:31,341 --> 02:04:32,660
for sure.
Um,

2564
02:04:33,110 --> 02:04:37,680
nobody knows quite how all of that.
Not only do they have these chromatic to

2565
02:04:37,681 --> 02:04:38,514
get the camouflage right,
but they also changed the texture of 

2566
02:04:40,891 --> 02:04:43,450
their skin to mimic things like coral 
and all this stuff.

2567
02:04:43,470 --> 02:04:44,303
Oh,
wouldn't it be cool if we made 

2568
02:04:46,741 --> 02:04:47,574
cephalopods the next great model 
organism and then we started doing 

2569
02:04:49,981 --> 02:04:50,814
comparative,
like not only neuroanatomy but 

2570
02:04:52,891 --> 02:04:53,724
connectomics where we're trying to study
how their brains are organized because 

2571
02:04:57,361 --> 02:04:58,194
they're so far away.
They're probably the closest we will 

2572
02:05:00,751 --> 02:05:01,584
ever get to meeting aliens.
I think I said that the last time was 

2573
02:05:03,390 --> 02:05:06,240
here and I'm really excited if that goes
forward.

2574
02:05:06,630 --> 02:05:07,463
Well,
it really doesn't seem like anything 

2575
02:05:08,101 --> 02:05:08,880
else.

2576
02:05:08,880 --> 02:05:09,590
Right.
You know,

2577
02:05:09,590 --> 02:05:11,790
whether it's a cuttlefish or whether 
it's an octopus like it,

2578
02:05:11,820 --> 02:05:12,421
you're like,
oh,

2579
02:05:12,421 --> 02:05:13,800
it's Kinda like a squid.
Like,

2580
02:05:14,490 --> 02:05:15,323
yeah,
a little bit like a person's like a 

2581
02:05:17,131 --> 02:05:18,390
monkey.
Yeah.

2582
02:05:18,391 --> 02:05:21,880
But like real different than Nautilus is
the craziest.

2583
02:05:22,240 --> 02:05:24,850
Maybe the cuddle fish is the most 
interesting for sure.

2584
02:05:24,851 --> 02:05:28,190
But they're both intelligent.
Right.

2585
02:05:28,800 --> 02:05:30,750
But like you regenerate.
That's another part of it.

2586
02:05:30,751 --> 02:05:32,790
That's bizarre.
Yeah.

2587
02:05:33,140 --> 02:05:35,730
Well it'd be fun to do.
I mean,

2588
02:05:35,760 --> 02:05:36,593
I would imagine that Knutson Salamanders
in the tetrapod category would be the 

2589
02:05:39,571 --> 02:05:43,230
best for us to study for regeneration.
I like how they regenerate up to a point

2590
02:05:43,470 --> 02:05:44,400
like nature say.
Yeah,

2591
02:05:44,401 --> 02:05:46,200
you can grow an arm back.
Kinko head back.

2592
02:05:46,290 --> 02:05:47,160
Sorry.
Fuck face.

2593
02:05:47,220 --> 02:05:48,510
That's a wrap.
Yeah.

2594
02:05:48,570 --> 02:05:50,190
You know,
you lose your head nature.

2595
02:05:50,191 --> 02:05:51,420
Like,
ah,

2596
02:05:51,421 --> 02:05:54,990
you gave up a big piece.
He gave up the queen over.

2597
02:05:55,140 --> 02:05:56,490
Yeah.
Game's over.

2598
02:05:56,550 --> 02:05:59,250
So you thought if you lose your tail,
like that's debatable.

2599
02:05:59,450 --> 02:06:01,340
Do you grow your tail back?
We could do that,

2600
02:06:01,600 --> 02:06:03,630
right?
Lizards grow their tail back,

2601
02:06:03,870 --> 02:06:06,780
but they only grow like most of it.
They don't grow the whole thing,

2602
02:06:06,810 --> 02:06:07,643
but the knutson salamanders seemed to 
have very high regena and you can just 

2603
02:06:11,101 --> 02:06:13,550
get in an arm off over and over again.
There is.

2604
02:06:13,600 --> 02:06:15,360
We can't cut their head off.
Yeah.

2605
02:06:15,690 --> 02:06:16,740
Why do you wanna cut their head off?
Well,

2606
02:06:17,030 --> 02:06:18,930
I don't,
but I mean just saying it's weird,

2607
02:06:18,960 --> 02:06:22,020
like you can't like chop them in half 
from the waist down.

2608
02:06:22,260 --> 02:06:25,350
They don't seal up and grow a new waste.
Like that's it.

2609
02:06:25,440 --> 02:06:27,070
You can only get rid of the limbs.
Yeah,

2610
02:06:27,300 --> 02:06:28,133
but you can get rid of the limps.
Like nature is evolved a strategy for 

2611
02:06:32,041 --> 02:06:32,874
dealing with probation.
Just give them the arm given the ticket 

2612
02:06:35,340 --> 02:06:35,790
pop.

2613
02:06:35,790 --> 02:06:37,380
What do you make of the fact that we had
this,

2614
02:06:37,381 --> 02:06:38,214
a successful head transplant in monkeys 
in the early seventies and then we 

2615
02:06:41,731 --> 02:06:43,980
walked away from it.
Probably good move.

2616
02:06:44,400 --> 02:06:45,233
Otherwise chicks at Beverly Hills,
it'd be getting new bodies just getting 

2617
02:06:48,151 --> 02:06:49,770
their head screwed on to new release.
Yeah,

2618
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:51,510
get new heads.
Yeah.

2619
02:06:51,511 --> 02:06:54,270
People would figure out a way to 
transplant the brains.

2620
02:06:54,390 --> 02:06:55,900
Everyone wants to live forever,
man.

2621
02:06:55,901 --> 02:06:56,734
I just have an 800 year old brain and 
talk about how your old motorcycle 

2622
02:07:00,721 --> 02:07:02,420
victim.
Yeah,

2623
02:07:02,760 --> 02:07:05,040
so people are going to start doing well 
then.

2624
02:07:05,041 --> 02:07:05,874
I guess it's thing that we walked.
I thought it was kind of a a weird move 

2625
02:07:08,791 --> 02:07:10,770
that will succeed at that and then say,
okay,

2626
02:07:10,980 --> 02:07:13,920
too much can't handle it.
Do you think that's what they did?

2627
02:07:14,230 --> 02:07:15,960
Oh,
it was probably hard to get funding.

2628
02:07:15,961 --> 02:07:17,270
People thought you were playing.
God,

2629
02:07:17,840 --> 02:07:18,673
the guy who did it,
I think it was maybe his name is Robert 

2630
02:07:21,330 --> 02:07:23,550
White and he was a devout Christian,
so it was really.

2631
02:07:23,970 --> 02:07:24,803
It was good because you know,
there was a lot of this reverence for 

2632
02:07:28,170 --> 02:07:31,290
the human form and if a religious person
is doing it,

2633
02:07:31,291 --> 02:07:33,570
we feel better than if somebody is like 
desecrating.

2634
02:07:33,720 --> 02:07:34,321
Right,
right.

2635
02:07:34,321 --> 02:07:35,154
Some atheist as scientists,
but he's cutting heads off dogs and 

2636
02:07:40,700 --> 02:07:42,770
Maria attaching them to monkeys.
Yeah.

2637
02:07:42,771 --> 02:07:45,160
That's what's also like.
We think of it as like,

2638
02:07:45,460 --> 02:07:46,293
okay,
it's one thing if you're trying out 

2639
02:07:46,931 --> 02:07:49,510
medicine on a monkey that might save 
babies,

2640
02:07:50,260 --> 02:07:51,540
but it's another thing if you just say,
hey,

2641
02:07:51,550 --> 02:07:53,170
what happens if I cut this monkey's head
off,

2642
02:07:53,440 --> 02:07:56,470
stick it on another monkey where there's
all this crazy.

2643
02:07:56,471 --> 02:08:01,360
I don't know if you've ever seen this.
The Russians had this film introduced by

2644
02:08:01,361 --> 02:08:02,194
Jbs Haldane,
great English biologist who was also a 

2645
02:08:04,331 --> 02:08:08,890
communist and therefore very pro Soviet,
and there's this experiment,

2646
02:08:09,010 --> 02:08:13,240
uh,
was experiments in a continuation of the

2647
02:08:13,600 --> 02:08:18,600
brain after death and they hook up the 
head to an artificial circulatory system

2648
02:08:20,410 --> 02:08:21,243
and they sort of continued to have 
interactions where they swab the head 

2649
02:08:24,371 --> 02:08:28,660
and they get the eyelash movement in the
tongue comes out and eat things.

2650
02:08:29,410 --> 02:08:31,540
It's quite interesting.
I would recommend it.

2651
02:08:31,890 --> 02:08:35,020
Yeah.
How Dean has one of the greatest quotes,

2652
02:08:35,320 --> 02:08:38,410
not only as the universe queer,
then you suppose it's queer.

2653
02:08:38,411 --> 02:08:42,850
Then we can suppose what a great quote.
He was also the inordinate fondness,

2654
02:08:42,851 --> 02:08:45,580
a Beatles guy,
inordinate fondness needles.

2655
02:08:46,250 --> 02:08:49,810
The Archbishop of Canterbury found 
himself,

2656
02:08:49,811 --> 02:08:50,644
I think,
seated across from how Dane and wanted 

2657
02:08:52,871 --> 02:08:55,600
to needle him because he was a communist
atheist and he said,

2658
02:08:56,320 --> 02:08:57,610
you know,
tell me what,

2659
02:08:58,220 --> 02:08:59,053
what,
what does your study of the biological 

2660
02:09:00,581 --> 02:09:04,700
would inform us about how great creator 
and how they shot him back.

2661
02:09:04,720 --> 02:09:08,200
He said that he has an inordinate 
fondness for beetles because beetles are

2662
02:09:08,201 --> 02:09:11,560
so highly speciated.
And what was his reaction to that?

2663
02:09:12,730 --> 02:09:13,800
Well,
I think it was a different era,

2664
02:09:13,850 --> 02:09:16,270
like smoked burn,
but like to our,

2665
02:09:16,271 --> 02:09:19,720
to our way of thinking.
It's not that hard of a burn.

2666
02:09:19,810 --> 02:09:20,643
Well,
we're really committed to the idea that 

2667
02:09:22,420 --> 02:09:25,390
all the stuff that we can do 
manipulating the planet,

2668
02:09:25,900 --> 02:09:26,733
sending rockets into space,
that that's more important than what an 

2669
02:09:28,901 --> 02:09:29,710
ant does.

2670
02:09:29,710 --> 02:09:32,500
What we're really committed to this,
that our significance,

2671
02:09:32,501 --> 02:09:34,360
although it's clearly if we're working 
together,

2672
02:09:34,361 --> 02:09:37,390
we believe in a sense of community.
It's more important to eat each other.

2673
02:09:37,420 --> 02:09:40,840
To us it is,
but to the whole thing is it really more

2674
02:09:40,841 --> 02:09:44,050
important?
Says you mean if people didn't exist,

2675
02:09:44,320 --> 02:09:46,780
we were wiped off the planet by all the 
other animals.

2676
02:09:46,781 --> 02:09:48,040
Would it be okay?
Really?

2677
02:09:48,041 --> 02:09:49,360
Would be okay.
I mean,

2678
02:09:49,361 --> 02:09:50,194
we would gain and lose more predators 
and we wouldn't be controlling the 

2679
02:09:53,291 --> 02:09:54,124
population.
Sure.

2680
02:09:54,460 --> 02:09:58,660
But if all the aunts went away,
that would be a wrap.

2681
02:09:59,170 --> 02:10:00,550
Yeah,
that'd be a wrap.

2682
02:10:01,120 --> 02:10:03,400
We're done.
No more people.

2683
02:10:03,430 --> 02:10:07,880
This hasn't been widely decided that if 
we lost all insect book,

2684
02:10:07,890 --> 02:10:08,723
especially all ants like it probably 
would collapse all the ecosystems that 

2685
02:10:12,851 --> 02:10:13,684
we need to sustain human life.
I have a feeling that those waterbury 

2686
02:10:16,120 --> 02:10:18,050
tardigrades would be like,
suck.

2687
02:10:18,550 --> 02:10:20,560
I got rid of the ads were the only ones 
left.

2688
02:10:20,830 --> 02:10:22,540
Well,
we wouldn't be able to make it,

2689
02:10:22,541 --> 02:10:25,260
but a lot of shit would make it a lot of
other stuff.

2690
02:10:25,350 --> 02:10:26,183
That's true,
but the thing that I think maybe we'd 

2691
02:10:28,631 --> 02:10:30,130
make it anyway.
Maybe they're wrong.

2692
02:10:30,600 --> 02:10:32,920
Just don't understand human trying to 
freak us out.

2693
02:10:33,200 --> 02:10:34,870
Yeah.
Maybe didn't read the Fi.

2694
02:10:34,910 --> 02:10:38,510
Find out if that's true.
If all aunts died,

2695
02:10:40,070 --> 02:10:42,920
human beings would go extinct.
Just Google that I think.

2696
02:10:43,040 --> 02:10:43,873
I think I read a paper proposing that 
and they were explaining the critical 

2697
02:10:47,421 --> 02:10:48,254
role that ants play in all these 
different ecosystems and how the bio 

2698
02:10:51,091 --> 02:10:51,924
mass of ants worldwide is equal to or 
greater than the biomass of human 

2699
02:10:56,661 --> 02:10:57,540
beings.
Okay.

2700
02:11:00,120 --> 02:11:01,980
I don't have any intuition around that.
Yeah,

2701
02:11:02,160 --> 02:11:04,200
sounds reasonable though.
I'm pretty sure that's true.

2702
02:11:04,820 --> 02:11:07,050
And so,
but our ideas that were more important.

2703
02:11:07,400 --> 02:11:08,040
Well,
we are.

2704
02:11:08,040 --> 02:11:09,210
I have cable.
Yeah.

2705
02:11:09,510 --> 02:11:11,520
Yeah.
That's why I think we're more four g,

2706
02:11:11,960 --> 02:11:12,880
four G.
okay.

2707
02:11:12,881 --> 02:11:17,881
That maybe that's more important.
I have a 70 inch television and,

2708
02:11:18,120 --> 02:11:20,040
and I,
I have an Iwatch.

2709
02:11:20,640 --> 02:11:22,410
Yeah.
It must be more important than stupid.

2710
02:11:22,411 --> 02:11:24,120
Fucking ant was dirt house.

2711
02:11:26,820 --> 02:11:29,100
If I can just piss on your house while I
go jogging.

2712
02:11:29,160 --> 02:11:30,890
Yeah.
I'm a more.

2713
02:11:30,900 --> 02:11:33,270
A more important thing than you.
Yeah.

2714
02:11:33,390 --> 02:11:37,110
I don't know.
My intuition half your people by pissing

2715
02:11:37,111 --> 02:11:38,550
on you.
Yeah.

2716
02:11:38,910 --> 02:11:42,360
Obviously nature is want to protect you.
You got your house in the dirt.

2717
02:11:42,450 --> 02:11:44,960
It's a whole mound.
Okay.

2718
02:11:45,290 --> 02:11:46,650
I don't know why I want to get serious 
on.

2719
02:11:46,651 --> 02:11:47,910
You're just trying to fuck with me.

2720
02:11:49,660 --> 02:11:50,493
The really interesting thing about 
humans is that we're the only species 

2721
02:11:52,791 --> 02:11:55,880
that understands what game we're in and 
we can reject the game.

2722
02:11:56,240 --> 02:11:58,310
Every other species is playing the game.
So,

2723
02:11:58,311 --> 02:11:59,270
you know,
you,

2724
02:11:59,440 --> 02:12:01,010
you know,
my brother very well,

2725
02:12:01,910 --> 02:12:02,743
very surprising to me that my brother 
only wanted to have two kids and didn't 

2726
02:12:05,481 --> 02:12:07,820
want to spend all his time down at the 
sperm bank.

2727
02:12:08,060 --> 02:12:08,781
Uh,
you know,

2728
02:12:08,781 --> 02:12:09,980
making donations.
I said,

2729
02:12:09,981 --> 02:12:10,814
you're an evolutionary theorist.
You ever think it's kind of weird that 

2730
02:12:13,011 --> 02:12:15,260
you're not playing this game very 
effectively?

2731
02:12:15,261 --> 02:12:19,400
And he shot me back this thing he said,
if you actually understand the game,

2732
02:12:19,401 --> 02:12:20,990
why would you want to continue to play 
it?

2733
02:12:22,250 --> 02:12:26,420
I thought that was really interesting 
that somebody who sounds like his wife

2734
02:12:26,430 --> 02:12:31,160
does want anymore kids rationalizations.
I get it,

2735
02:12:31,161 --> 02:12:32,660
bro.
Yeah.

2736
02:12:33,470 --> 02:12:36,950
The article I found says all all insects
dying,

2737
02:12:36,951 --> 02:12:38,040
not just answer,
Oh,

2738
02:12:38,090 --> 02:12:38,923
insects.
And we take 50 years for people to 

2739
02:12:40,281 --> 02:12:42,070
disappear for that.
According to this,

2740
02:12:42,071 --> 02:12:44,240
a science explorer article,
um,

2741
02:12:44,990 --> 02:12:48,440
find out the biomass of ants because 
that's even trippier

2742
02:12:51,710 --> 02:12:52,260
open.
I'm,

2743
02:12:52,260 --> 02:12:55,290
but I want to get rid of this anti human
thing because I'm not answering.

2744
02:12:55,340 --> 02:12:55,980
I know.
No,

2745
02:12:55,980 --> 02:12:58,710
you're assuming neutral.
Knowing biologically neutral.

2746
02:12:58,830 --> 02:13:00,590
If I just looked at it objectively.
Yeah,

2747
02:13:00,591 --> 02:13:02,070
I know.
I said you don't think so.

2748
02:13:02,071 --> 02:13:05,100
You think it's more significant because 
we're more significant to each other?

2749
02:13:05,130 --> 02:13:05,963
Well,
there's no significance in the whole 

2750
02:13:06,601 --> 02:13:08,560
game if you just take completely 
materials.

2751
02:13:08,570 --> 02:13:10,590
Like what do we care is one rock,
one SPEC,

2752
02:13:10,591 --> 02:13:11,500
big deal.
Right?

2753
02:13:11,520 --> 02:13:14,760
So the problem is if you accept that as 
an answer,

2754
02:13:15,660 --> 02:13:16,493
then you've kind of failed by just 
taking the nihilist way out and to me 

2755
02:13:22,160 --> 02:13:25,560
like they have this annual question,
that edge.org,

2756
02:13:25,561 --> 02:13:28,470
and then finally the guy got exhausted 
and want to ask another one.

2757
02:13:28,471 --> 02:13:32,010
So I'll finish this up quick and then 
we'll you think I'm

2758
02:13:32,010 --> 02:13:32,580
sorry.
No,

2759
02:13:32,580 --> 02:13:35,040
you want to take it and do our aunts 
outweigh humans?

2760
02:13:35,041 --> 02:13:38,820
Individual workers way an average 
between one to five milligrams according

2761
02:13:38,821 --> 02:13:39,654
to the species.
When combined all ants in the world 

2762
02:13:42,181 --> 02:13:45,330
taken together way about as much as all 
human beings.

2763
02:13:46,260 --> 02:13:47,940
That's interesting.
Wow.

2764
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:49,050
Yeah,
that's what I'm saying.

2765
02:13:50,250 --> 02:13:54,450
That's fucking bananas.
Who they are,

2766
02:13:54,480 --> 02:13:55,313
15 to 20 percent of the terrestrial 
animal biomass and in tropical regions 

2767
02:14:01,200 --> 02:14:05,160
where answer especially abundant,
they monopolize 25 percent or more.

2768
02:14:08,270 --> 02:14:10,310
I'm an after I have a buddy of mine,
Brian Cowen,

2769
02:14:10,490 --> 02:14:12,000
Ryan accountant used to,
uh,

2770
02:14:12,090 --> 02:14:13,770
he,
when he was in college,

2771
02:14:13,771 --> 02:14:14,604
he spent some time in the jungle.
He was thinking he was going to be a 

2772
02:14:16,741 --> 02:14:19,890
biologist and he was going to study 
insect who's going to be in,

2773
02:14:20,660 --> 02:14:21,493
what is it in insectivore.
And so they had to sleep in these 

2774
02:14:27,240 --> 02:14:28,073
elevated tents and they had to paint 
like some sort of like Turpentine type 

2775
02:14:31,801 --> 02:14:35,280
chemical all over the posts because of 
they didn't.

2776
02:14:35,460 --> 02:14:40,260
The ants would crawl up the post and eat
you and your sleep would literally climb

2777
02:14:40,261 --> 02:14:41,094
in your ear and start eating you and 
tell everybody and you would die that 

2778
02:14:44,431 --> 02:14:47,700
way.
Like people have died and elephants have

2779
02:14:47,701 --> 02:14:48,534
been eaten by ants and he said,
you can hear them walking in the jungle 

2780
02:14:53,030 --> 02:14:53,863
like in the night you hear,
you hear the footsteps of fucking ants 

2781
02:14:59,250 --> 02:15:00,083
because there's so many of us.
If you're in the wrong place at the 

2782
02:15:01,471 --> 02:15:02,304
wrong time.
And there's a path of these 

2783
02:15:03,781 --> 02:15:08,310
motherfuckers moving your way and they 
send a signal that we got something here

2784
02:15:08,400 --> 02:15:11,370
and they crawl up you,
they just all start crawling up you.

2785
02:15:11,371 --> 02:15:12,840
And there's so many of them,
you can't avoid them

2786
02:15:13,020 --> 02:15:15,570
because they're not really separate 
animals right there.

2787
02:15:15,571 --> 02:15:20,120
Use Social Hymenoptera has this weird 
property of this haplodiploid structures

2788
02:15:20,130 --> 02:15:22,830
so that the females are highly related 
to each other.

2789
02:15:23,190 --> 02:15:27,480
And so in the same way that your cells 
aren't individual animals,

2790
02:15:27,540 --> 02:15:28,373
they all conspire to create you.
There is a sense in which in this world 

2791
02:15:33,480 --> 02:15:36,840
of bees and ants and wasps and things.
Hi,

2792
02:15:36,880 --> 02:15:41,400
my Hymenoptera,
the real entity is the colony.

2793
02:15:41,401 --> 02:15:42,930
It's not the individual,
right?

2794
02:15:43,320 --> 02:15:43,921
So,
you know,

2795
02:15:43,921 --> 02:15:46,740
if I took a cytological approach,
um,

2796
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:50,130
to you and I just went set cell by cell,
you know,

2797
02:15:50,131 --> 02:15:51,450
you're,
you're this collection of,

2798
02:15:51,930 --> 02:15:52,763
uh,
you know,

2799
02:15:52,830 --> 02:15:57,830
10 or 50 trillion separate entities.
And that's what makes ants so terrifying

2800
02:15:58,640 --> 02:16:00,090
is that,
you know,

2801
02:16:00,110 --> 02:16:03,960
Kropotkin and the great anarchistic a 
sort of an amateur naturalist.

2802
02:16:03,961 --> 02:16:04,794
And he,
he would look to natural systems and 

2803
02:16:06,901 --> 02:16:09,150
say,
why can't humans cooperate like this?

2804
02:16:09,510 --> 02:16:10,343
The point is,
we're not structured to cooperate in 

2805
02:16:13,201 --> 02:16:17,700
this use social fashion.
The way they cooperate is so uncanny.

2806
02:16:17,880 --> 02:16:21,990
When those leaf cutter ants designed 
those intricate cities with,

2807
02:16:22,230 --> 02:16:23,063
they have places where things for meant 
and were gases are released through 

2808
02:16:26,881 --> 02:16:30,220
holes in the ground and it doesn't make 
any

2809
02:16:30,220 --> 02:16:34,600
sense that this little tiny brain could 
figure out this enormous structure,

2810
02:16:34,601 --> 02:16:38,620
but somehow or another when combined,
and not just any brain,

2811
02:16:38,740 --> 02:16:40,150
right,
not just one,

2812
02:16:40,450 --> 02:16:41,283
one version of this,
but millions and millions of these 

2813
02:16:44,980 --> 02:16:48,850
designs appear all over the world and 
they see if he could find that video.

2814
02:16:48,851 --> 02:16:51,760
Have they filled a leaf cutter ant 
colony?

2815
02:16:51,880 --> 02:16:54,830
They filled the home with molten metal.
Yeah.

2816
02:16:54,840 --> 02:16:58,170
It was something like that.
Yeah.

2817
02:16:58,420 --> 02:17:00,790
I think they.
They flooded it with concrete.

2818
02:17:00,791 --> 02:17:01,624
They flooded concrete in all the holes 
and then they dug out everything around 

2819
02:17:04,511 --> 02:17:08,200
it so you could see this structure and 
then they explained what.

2820
02:17:09,230 --> 02:17:10,063
This is really well thought out,
like they have portals and they have 

2821
02:17:13,241 --> 02:17:14,074
the.
This is how they get the food in and 

2822
02:17:15,161 --> 02:17:16,780
this is where they take the leaves and 
they,

2823
02:17:16,920 --> 02:17:17,753
they,
they let them rot and turn into mulch 

2824
02:17:19,541 --> 02:17:20,374
and there's like a gas remedies 
distributed loosely coupled system 

2825
02:17:23,441 --> 02:17:23,530
would.

2826
02:17:23,530 --> 02:17:27,220
It makes it seem so amazing.
It is utterly amazing.

2827
02:17:27,280 --> 02:17:32,280
But if you think about it as individuals
making decisions that conspire to create

2828
02:17:32,531 --> 02:17:34,180
these,
these structures,

2829
02:17:34,900 --> 02:17:36,100
it's less,
it's,

2830
02:17:37,440 --> 02:17:40,000
that's more amazing than what it is,
which is,

2831
02:17:40,060 --> 02:17:43,750
it's a loosely coupled,
a distributed system,

2832
02:17:44,330 --> 02:17:45,163
you know,
so that's how a bee hive will send out 

2833
02:17:49,241 --> 02:17:50,074
explorers and they'll report back and 
they'll do the dance and the dance 

2834
02:17:53,081 --> 02:17:57,280
communicates the information and you get
all these coordinated activities.

2835
02:17:57,910 --> 02:17:58,743
Um,
in what other systems do you suppress 

2836
02:18:01,331 --> 02:18:06,331
the fertility of females because the 
relatedness is so high.

2837
02:18:06,551 --> 02:18:07,690
This is gorgeous.
Yeah.

2838
02:18:07,691 --> 02:18:11,830
This is the video we're talking about.
So this is really huge too.

2839
02:18:12,370 --> 02:18:13,203
And they have these looks like tunnel 
systems and then they lead to these big 

2840
02:18:18,281 --> 02:18:23,281
circular areas where they're really 
almost uniform in size and it's a really

2841
02:18:23,741 --> 02:18:26,320
strange way or similar in size.
They.

2842
02:18:26,320 --> 02:18:29,960
So they have these pathways that go to 
these like rooms,

2843
02:18:30,090 --> 02:18:30,923
you circular rooms and there's just this
incredible network of these tubes and 

2844
02:18:37,781 --> 02:18:38,614
circular rooms that they uncover and 
it's fucking enormous when you look at 

2845
02:18:42,611 --> 02:18:43,444
how big this thing.
I mean if you had to like how big is 

2846
02:18:45,761 --> 02:18:47,830
that?
Was that 80 feet across,

2847
02:18:47,831 --> 02:18:50,560
90 feet across or something like that.
Good,

2848
02:18:50,561 --> 02:18:52,900
good.
So they're continuing to dig this up.

2849
02:18:52,901 --> 02:18:54,670
They're not even done in this video 
here,

2850
02:18:54,880 --> 02:18:57,640
but you see all the pipes that extend to
the left and to the right.

2851
02:18:57,641 --> 02:19:01,360
So they've developed some sort of 
complex civilization,

2852
02:19:01,630 --> 02:19:02,463
some weird bizarre network of these 
passageways and rooms and they do it 

2853
02:19:08,980 --> 02:19:09,813
just like this everywhere.
So some pattern has emerged in their 

2854
02:19:14,291 --> 02:19:15,124
species that has set them up to act as 
this collective group and then operate 

2855
02:19:22,231 --> 02:19:26,520
in a similar fashion all over the world.
Wherever they exist in that sort of with

2856
02:19:26,600 --> 02:19:28,370
that kind of dirt they can manipulate,
right?

2857
02:19:28,371 --> 02:19:33,371
That that's dad alone is one that is a 
massive mystery.

2858
02:19:33,720 --> 02:19:34,553
Hey,
how a little tiny thing with a brain 

2859
02:19:36,800 --> 02:19:39,050
that's almost imperceptibly small.

2860
02:19:39,690 --> 02:19:40,523
This is like tiny little head,
his little head was he figured out that 

2861
02:19:44,011 --> 02:19:44,844
whole,
how do you figuring out tunnels that 

2862
02:19:46,231 --> 02:19:48,870
he's not really not.
This is what I'm trying to get out there

2863
02:19:48,871 --> 02:19:50,700
working together.
Okay.

2864
02:19:50,701 --> 02:19:52,260
So if you look at,
for example,

2865
02:19:52,290 --> 02:19:53,123
Si elegans,
the nematode with a thousand cells for 

2866
02:19:55,861 --> 02:19:58,530
the entire body plan,
300 of which are neurons.

2867
02:19:59,280 --> 02:20:03,000
We have a complete map,
not only of the cell lineage diagram,

2868
02:20:03,001 --> 02:20:06,570
which is how this thing unfolds from a 
single fertilized egg,

2869
02:20:07,290 --> 02:20:11,040
but we also have a complete wiring 
diagram of its nervous system.

2870
02:20:11,430 --> 02:20:14,100
So this is something that locomotive 
moves around and eats,

2871
02:20:14,190 --> 02:20:15,023
has sex and it's only got 300 neurons.
Each of those is extremely primitive 

2872
02:20:21,241 --> 02:20:22,074
machine and they send signals to each 
other and we still don't know that how 

2873
02:20:24,941 --> 02:20:25,774
the thing really works.
Even though we've got the entire thing 

2874
02:20:27,451 --> 02:20:29,260
mapped.
Jesus,

2875
02:20:29,280 --> 02:20:34,050
this was the great insight of Sydney 
Brenner that we would make the,

2876
02:20:34,460 --> 02:20:36,010
the worm,
uh,

2877
02:20:36,150 --> 02:20:41,150
the great model organism because we 
could actually map everything about it.

2878
02:20:41,400 --> 02:20:42,233
Right?
And it is astounding to me how little 

2879
02:20:44,881 --> 02:20:46,980
we've learned.
We've learned a ton from it,

2880
02:20:47,850 --> 02:20:48,683
but I had thought that we would have 
gotten much farther and understanding 

2881
02:20:52,051 --> 02:20:52,884
the brain.

2882
02:20:53,630 --> 02:20:58,630
Did you see this recent discovery of a 
25 foot long sea worm that apparently is

2883
02:21:01,191 --> 02:21:06,191
not just one organism has many organisms
together combined?

2884
02:21:07,430 --> 02:21:08,480
No.
Yeah.

2885
02:21:08,510 --> 02:21:11,030
I've got to find out about that.
Yeah.

2886
02:21:11,031 --> 02:21:11,864
You got to see this fucking thing.
It's insane and I think there's a very 

2887
02:21:15,681 --> 02:21:16,514
recent discovery,
at least one this large and these guys 

2888
02:21:19,551 --> 02:21:23,150
are swimming around with this thing.
It looks impossible.

2889
02:21:23,180 --> 02:21:24,013
It looks like they landed on another 
planet and they're experiencing this 

2890
02:21:28,401 --> 02:21:32,510
thing like this thing,
this whatever this is.

2891
02:21:33,080 --> 02:21:33,913
I'm pretty sure that what I read,
I read it really quickly as I was 

2892
02:21:36,171 --> 02:21:41,171
running out the door that it exists.
Large eight mil eight meter worm,

2893
02:21:41,681 --> 02:21:44,330
like sea creature stuns New Zealand 
divers,

2894
02:21:44,331 --> 02:21:45,164
so they're looking at this thing,
but I think there's many different 

2895
02:21:47,121 --> 02:21:50,150
organisms inside of it and I don't think
it's one individual organism.

2896
02:21:51,680 --> 02:21:55,430
Yeah.
It's made up of hundreds of thousands of

2897
02:21:55,431 --> 02:21:56,770
organisms.
I've never seen that.

2898
02:21:57,200 --> 02:21:58,760
Yeah.
Like what?

2899
02:21:59,660 --> 02:22:02,000
What is it like?
What does that mean?

2900
02:22:03,010 --> 02:22:03,843
Is this is a weird tube for folks that 
are watching this or listening to this 

2901
02:22:07,131 --> 02:22:07,964
rather,
what we're looking at is these divers 

2902
02:22:09,231 --> 02:22:11,180
that are just tripping balls here,
they're like,

2903
02:22:11,181 --> 02:22:16,181
what in the fuck is this?
And it looks like like an enormous tube,

2904
02:22:16,191 --> 02:22:19,340
like Jelly fish type creature that's in 
the water.

2905
02:22:19,430 --> 02:22:21,410
It almost looks semi translucent,
right?

2906
02:22:21,411 --> 02:22:23,010
Would you say?
And this tour Finland,

2907
02:22:23,390 --> 02:22:25,130
it's enormous.
It's so.

2908
02:22:26,100 --> 02:22:29,670
It's like the size and what moves and 
changes,

2909
02:22:29,671 --> 02:22:30,504
but at sometimes it's larger than a 
human waste or a human chest and other 

2910
02:22:35,011 --> 02:22:39,540
times it gets real skinny,
but it's a fucking huge.

2911
02:22:40,140 --> 02:22:42,090
Like look at that.
What is that thing that.

2912
02:22:43,140 --> 02:22:46,800
I'm stunned by the fact that it's like I
don't understand what they're saying,

2913
02:22:46,801 --> 02:22:49,200
that it's made up of hundreds of 
thousands of organisms.

2914
02:22:49,201 --> 02:22:51,360
Like how is it made up of different 
stuff?

2915
02:22:51,361 --> 02:22:52,194
Like what is it like?
Have you ever heard of anything like 

2916
02:22:53,821 --> 02:22:56,190
this?
I like the Portuguese man of war I think

2917
02:22:56,191 --> 02:22:58,650
is like five different organisms,
isn't it?

2918
02:22:59,460 --> 02:23:00,293
Isn't it?
The collaborate in effect really the 

2919
02:23:03,271 --> 02:23:05,490
Portuguese man of war is not like a one 
thing.

2920
02:23:06,750 --> 02:23:08,340
Look at the size of that thing above the
water.

2921
02:23:10,280 --> 02:23:14,540
That is fucking crazy.
Piracy home.

2922
02:23:16,070 --> 02:23:19,250
Just whatever the ocean is like that.
Like we're all.

2923
02:23:19,360 --> 02:23:20,193
We're trying to look into space.
Like I wonder if there's aliens out 

2924
02:23:22,161 --> 02:23:24,200
there.
There's no.

2925
02:23:25,690 --> 02:23:28,820
Whether it's cuddle fish or octopus or 
this goddamn thing.

2926
02:23:29,720 --> 02:23:32,920
Whoa.
Pyro Psalm.

2927
02:23:32,990 --> 02:23:34,670
What the fuck?
That thing looks like.

2928
02:23:34,671 --> 02:23:38,420
A geometric pattern.
That's a nice one.

2929
02:23:38,690 --> 02:23:40,070
Look at that.
One of the upper right hand corner.

2930
02:23:40,071 --> 02:23:41,530
Jamie,
what does that weird looking fucking.

2931
02:23:41,600 --> 02:23:46,550
What is that thing?
60 foot long jet powered animal.

2932
02:23:47,210 --> 02:23:49,400
Oh God.
It's like a civilization.

2933
02:23:49,401 --> 02:23:52,580
It's like a ship of these things flying 
through the ocean.

2934
02:23:52,820 --> 02:23:54,830
What?
Have you ever seen this before?

2935
02:23:55,370 --> 02:23:58,610
What the fuck is that?
That is so weird looking.

2936
02:23:59,300 --> 02:24:00,081
Uh,
come on man.

2937
02:24:00,081 --> 02:24:02,020
That looks like something from Avatar 
doesn't.

2938
02:24:02,040 --> 02:24:03,890
Yeah,
it totally does.

2939
02:24:03,891 --> 02:24:04,724
Right?
Like something that comes up that tree 

2940
02:24:06,440 --> 02:24:08,180
hopefully put it in the new movie.
Yeah.

2941
02:24:08,181 --> 02:24:11,690
Tell Call James Cameron.
Look at this thing.

2942
02:24:12,290 --> 02:24:13,123
So this is what those things are,
but the other one is a very smooth or 

2943
02:24:15,941 --> 02:24:18,320
it's low resolution and we can't get a 
really good look at it.

2944
02:24:18,800 --> 02:24:19,633
But that's what it is,
is this collective group of hundreds of 

2945
02:24:22,100 --> 02:24:22,933
thousands of organisms that combined 
together and they're getting jacked by 

2946
02:24:25,611 --> 02:24:27,800
that turtle.
All you bitches.

2947
02:24:30,890 --> 02:24:31,723
What a weird,
weird organisms that look at this 

2948
02:24:34,851 --> 02:24:38,090
picture if you stuck your arm in it and 
it just.

2949
02:24:38,210 --> 02:24:39,770
Dude,
how bizarre is it?

2950
02:24:39,771 --> 02:24:44,480
The disease of civilization of these 
things all combined.

2951
02:24:44,600 --> 02:24:48,560
But what they are is individuals that 
operate as a giant tube.

2952
02:24:51,240 --> 02:24:53,990
You never heard of this before.
Now I'm so happy we found something.

2953
02:24:54,020 --> 02:24:57,550
You don't know about your stuff,
man.

2954
02:24:58,440 --> 02:25:01,150
That was fucking weird one man.
But the.

2955
02:25:01,400 --> 02:25:02,233
Yeah,
the idea that the ocean is really an 

2956
02:25:03,211 --> 02:25:04,620
alien world.
Yeah.

2957
02:25:05,310 --> 02:25:06,143
Well the funniest part is when you hear 
these guys with their remote 

2958
02:25:10,740 --> 02:25:12,930
submersibles and they find some new life
for them.

2959
02:25:13,030 --> 02:25:14,200
Yeah.
They're like,

2960
02:25:14,640 --> 02:25:15,870
take me down.
Believe me.

2961
02:25:15,871 --> 02:25:17,520
Those.
Wait.

2962
02:25:17,970 --> 02:25:22,100
What does that feel like?
They get really excited because it's,

2963
02:25:22,930 --> 02:25:25,480
it's the ability to meet aliens.
There are new things.

2964
02:25:25,510 --> 02:25:26,500
Yeah.
I mean we,

2965
02:25:26,501 --> 02:25:31,110
we've Kinda sorta mapped out the stuff 
more or less or.

2966
02:25:31,660 --> 02:25:33,400
Yeah,
there's like a few weird things you find

2967
02:25:33,401 --> 02:25:34,600
in the jungle.
Weird bugs.

2968
02:25:34,630 --> 02:25:35,463
Like where's that?
Vietnam has some surprises for us here 

2969
02:25:37,930 --> 02:25:40,000
with fangs.
Ever seen those?

2970
02:25:40,540 --> 02:25:41,373
Oh,
the Sulawesi boars or they'll the deer 

2971
02:25:42,980 --> 02:25:44,320
really damn empire,
dear.

2972
02:25:44,560 --> 02:25:44,920
I Dunno.

2973
02:25:44,920 --> 02:25:47,560
I Dunno about vampires here.
It's the craziest looking thing ever.

2974
02:25:47,561 --> 02:25:48,394
It's deer with fangs like crocodile look
and fangs that come hanging down like 

2975
02:25:52,631 --> 02:25:54,790
this.
If this is some jackalope thing.

2976
02:25:54,850 --> 02:25:55,840
No,
it's not.

2977
02:25:55,841 --> 02:25:58,540
It's a weird little animal.
It's not a big deer either.

2978
02:25:58,690 --> 02:25:59,230
Well,
do you know?

2979
02:25:59,230 --> 02:26:02,350
Look at that thing vampire,
dear.

2980
02:26:04,030 --> 02:26:05,270
That's a real animal.
Look at that.

2981
02:26:06,520 --> 02:26:09,240
How fucking strange.
What was it?

2982
02:26:09,241 --> 02:26:10,630
What was in this coffee?
Jamie?

2983
02:26:10,760 --> 02:26:14,350
Look at that thing will get their 
fucking teeth on that thing.

2984
02:26:15,490 --> 02:26:19,240
It's probably something akin to their 
antlers.

2985
02:26:19,241 --> 02:26:20,830
They use it to defend themselves.
Okay.

2986
02:26:20,831 --> 02:26:22,660
That's not real.
Not Real,

2987
02:26:22,900 --> 02:26:23,733
because that's a mule deer,
so that one that you just pick some 

2988
02:26:26,351 --> 02:26:30,910
photoshop bullshit.
What's interesting is apparently I'm elk

2989
02:26:30,911 --> 02:26:34,480
have these things called the people call
them Ivoree's now,

2990
02:26:34,750 --> 02:26:35,583
but they.
What they are is at one point in time 

2991
02:26:37,121 --> 02:26:40,470
they had tusks like a boar,
like giant toss.

2992
02:26:40,480 --> 02:26:41,313
It probably aided them in their fights 
and they eventually shrank and now 

2993
02:26:45,671 --> 02:26:48,400
they're just this weird sort of nubby 
thing.

2994
02:26:48,900 --> 02:26:50,860
I'm actually have some here.
I'll show it to you.

2995
02:26:51,060 --> 02:26:51,893
Yeah.
The after the podcast will show them to 

2996
02:26:53,561 --> 02:26:54,394
you,
but they,

2997
02:26:54,600 --> 02:26:57,910
they're this weird thing that's not 
quite a tooth.

2998
02:26:58,090 --> 02:27:00,370
It's ivory.
It grows inside their head.

2999
02:27:00,700 --> 02:27:02,680
And at one point in time it was some 
kind of a weapon,

3000
02:27:02,681 --> 02:27:04,360
just like their head is.
I mean the antlers,

3001
02:27:05,180 --> 02:27:07,480
you know,
it's the largest.

3002
02:27:07,750 --> 02:27:09,140
How do we describe this?
What was the,

3003
02:27:09,141 --> 02:27:09,760
the,
the,

3004
02:27:09,760 --> 02:27:14,760
the quickest growing thing in the animal
world is the,

3005
02:27:15,471 --> 02:27:18,790
the antlers of an elk because look how 
fucking huge they are.

3006
02:27:18,791 --> 02:27:19,624
They fall off every year and they grow 
back every year and it's all just for 

3007
02:27:22,811 --> 02:27:23,644
fighting.
And they used to grow back tusks to 

3008
02:27:25,540 --> 02:27:27,880
where they used to have.
The acid tests were permanent,

3009
02:27:28,270 --> 02:27:29,103
but they used to just.

3010
02:27:29,390 --> 02:27:32,980
That's just for Duking it out.
It's crazy weaponry,

3011
02:27:32,981 --> 02:27:34,850
sexual selection.
Well,

3012
02:27:34,970 --> 02:27:37,270
you went into a really weird thing and 
the Dung Beetle,

3013
02:27:37,480 --> 02:27:38,313
um,
there's a conserved system whereby in 

3014
02:27:41,231 --> 02:27:42,064
some dung beetles,
the amount of weaponry you have as your 

3015
02:27:44,201 --> 02:27:49,201
antler is inversely proportional to the 
amount of military apparatus you have,

3016
02:27:50,710 --> 02:27:51,543
where it counts.
And so if you have really impressive 

3017
02:27:56,050 --> 02:28:00,250
weaponry,
you're not able to do quite as much,

3018
02:28:00,430 --> 02:28:01,263
and that may be the engine of 
speciations because the vagina and 

3019
02:28:04,871 --> 02:28:07,030
penis,
that system is a lock and key.

3020
02:28:07,360 --> 02:28:11,260
And so if something shrinks too much,
then you can't necessarily get,

3021
02:28:11,320 --> 02:28:13,180
get the Job Sofa,
greedy.

3022
02:28:13,300 --> 02:28:16,450
Dung beetle with giant horns just fucks 
everybody up.

3023
02:28:16,840 --> 02:28:17,673
His genes can pass on.
Maybe there's a certain amount of 

3024
02:28:19,570 --> 02:28:21,710
cooperation is needed in the dung world.

3025
02:28:22,140 --> 02:28:24,500
Can have an oppressor,
can have a gang,

3026
02:28:24,501 --> 02:28:25,334
is con of the Dung Beetle world,
the Patriarchy and the Dung beetle 

3027
02:28:27,981 --> 02:28:28,814
world.
Look at the size of the antler on that 

3028
02:28:29,871 --> 02:28:31,730
guy,
but girls make fun of them.

3029
02:28:31,910 --> 02:28:36,910
Probably the dung beetle world because 
like the guy with the Lamborghini,

3030
02:28:37,220 --> 02:28:40,340
exactly like what's he doing over there 
with these giant?

3031
02:28:40,580 --> 02:28:44,180
It looks like elk antlers probably is a 
tiny little dick.

3032
02:28:44,480 --> 02:28:45,380
You want.
You want to,

3033
02:28:45,381 --> 02:28:46,214
God's just got little like that,
like that guy probably probably hung 

3034
02:28:49,311 --> 02:28:51,130
like a roach.
Right?

3035
02:28:51,420 --> 02:28:53,500
Have a hunting question for you.
Okay.

3036
02:28:53,540 --> 02:28:56,000
I started looking into this primitive 
hunting thing.

3037
02:28:56,001 --> 02:29:01,001
I was positively predisposed towards 
hunting and I turned myself off of.

3038
02:29:02,000 --> 02:29:02,833
I mean I don't hunt,
but I turned myself off of hunting by 

3039
02:29:06,081 --> 02:29:11,081
watching the effect of some of these 
people who are baiting and killing bears

3040
02:29:11,870 --> 02:29:12,703
in ways that it just doesn't feel to me 
like hyper respectful and I wondered if 

3041
02:29:19,881 --> 02:29:23,060
there's like a deeper layer where if I 
got even deeper into it,

3042
02:29:23,061 --> 02:29:23,894
I would understand it or am I actually 
correct that there is something weird 

3043
02:29:27,951 --> 02:29:28,784
about the effect of attracting some 
beautiful bear to a kind of easy place 

3044
02:29:33,831 --> 02:29:38,780
to kill it and then just getting super 
excited about doing it in well,

3045
02:29:38,780 --> 02:29:38,840
how

3046
02:29:38,840 --> 02:29:39,673
your natural instincts,
there's a reason for them and you're 

3047
02:29:42,291 --> 02:29:43,530
most certainly correct.
It's,

3048
02:29:43,531 --> 02:29:47,030
it's a weird feeling.
The idea that you're going to trick this

3049
02:29:47,031 --> 02:29:50,250
bear and thinking he's going there to 
eat and then you kill them.

3050
02:29:50,780 --> 02:29:53,960
Bear hunting is different than any other
kind of haunting in the.

3051
02:29:53,961 --> 02:29:56,120
First of all,
there's a lot of emotional attachment to

3052
02:29:56,121 --> 02:29:58,370
it because people love teddy bears and 
things along those lines,

3053
02:29:58,820 --> 02:30:02,360
but bears are this idea that they're 
beautiful.

3054
02:30:02,390 --> 02:30:04,400
They've definitely are.
They definitely are.

3055
02:30:04,401 --> 02:30:05,234
They're also one of the more ruthless 
animals in the animal kingdom and 

3056
02:30:07,881 --> 02:30:11,540
they're all cannibals.
All of them and the males don't.

3057
02:30:11,600 --> 02:30:12,433
Don't just go after the cubs.
They eat them and they go after them 

3058
02:30:16,161 --> 02:30:16,994
specifically to eat them,
and then when the males get chased off 

3059
02:30:19,341 --> 02:30:20,960
the female,
what year on cubs,

3060
02:30:21,110 --> 02:30:25,010
and this is universal,
there are also responsible for the death

3061
02:30:25,011 --> 02:30:29,540
of at least 50 percent of undulate 
calves and Fonz,

3062
02:30:29,690 --> 02:30:31,310
whether it's moose,
cows,

3063
02:30:31,311 --> 02:30:31,580
somebody.

3064
02:30:31,580 --> 02:30:32,413
I don't have any of these issues.
So they also are really difficult to 

3065
02:30:35,451 --> 02:30:38,240
hunt and their populations thought by 
wildlife.

3066
02:30:38,241 --> 02:30:41,390
Biologists are important to keep under 
control by all of that.

3067
02:30:41,480 --> 02:30:45,280
So in areas of extreme density like 
forest,

3068
02:30:45,290 --> 02:30:49,100
you will not kill them unless you bait.
You will not.

3069
02:30:49,130 --> 02:30:51,560
So if you one of two things has to 
happen.

3070
02:30:51,561 --> 02:30:53,900
Either they have to use dogs,
which is what they used to use a lot.

3071
02:30:54,140 --> 02:30:56,150
These used to be California until the 19
nineties.

3072
02:30:56,151 --> 02:31:01,151
They outlawed hound hunting and then the
odd baiting around the same time.

3073
02:31:01,611 --> 02:31:02,444
What they essentially did,
northern cal in California is they 

3074
02:31:04,370 --> 02:31:06,200
outlawed bear hunting,
but they didn't.

3075
02:31:06,260 --> 02:31:08,540
You can still hunt bears,
but it's extremely difficult,

3076
02:31:08,541 --> 02:31:11,060
almost impossible with a bow or very,
very unlikely,

3077
02:31:11,210 --> 02:31:16,210
like your rate of success of extremely 
low if you want to control populations,

3078
02:31:16,311 --> 02:31:17,144
if you like to eat moose and deer or you
want to have them keep healthy 

3079
02:31:20,911 --> 02:31:21,744
populations and you don't want the bare 
encroaching on these rural homes and 

3080
02:31:25,561 --> 02:31:26,394
these areas,
you have to control their populations 

3081
02:31:27,900 --> 02:31:30,390
and there's very few other ways to 
control them.

3082
02:31:30,640 --> 02:31:31,473
Relations other than baiting them,
so assume that I was positively 

3083
02:31:34,601 --> 02:31:35,434
predisposed to hunting.
I do think that they're beautiful 

3084
02:31:36,911 --> 02:31:38,710
creatures.
I think they're emotional creatures,

3085
02:31:39,160 --> 02:31:41,770
but I understand they're all.
They're all beautiful.

3086
02:31:42,200 --> 02:31:43,300
I think.
I mean,

3087
02:31:43,301 --> 02:31:45,670
I think the frogs are beautiful.
They're fascinating.

3088
02:31:45,790 --> 02:31:48,100
It's the effect that freaked me out.
It should.

3089
02:31:48,610 --> 02:31:52,660
It's a weird form of trickery and we 
don't think it's sporting right,

3090
02:31:53,200 --> 02:31:57,340
but the idea is that if you really want 
to control their populations,

3091
02:31:57,341 --> 02:31:58,174
you have to accept that this is a 
necessary evil so that I grasped that 

3092
02:32:01,790 --> 02:32:02,623
it's still at the level that the thing 
that surprised me was that the effect 

3093
02:32:08,441 --> 02:32:13,441
wasn't the expected effect of the hunter
with reverence in some sense.

3094
02:32:16,691 --> 02:32:18,870
Sufficient reverence for the kill.
Yeah,

3095
02:32:19,240 --> 02:32:20,890
that's what flipped me out.
Well,

3096
02:32:20,891 --> 02:32:21,724
there's people get excited and they get 
happy that they're successful because 

3097
02:32:25,511 --> 02:32:28,210
hunting is difficult and then if you 
take that into context,

3098
02:32:28,480 --> 02:32:30,430
if you take that out of context and 
people get happy,

3099
02:32:30,431 --> 02:32:34,930
especially when they're happy,
they're getting happy around people that

3100
02:32:34,931 --> 02:32:39,931
have no problem with hunting scene,
one of the problems with respect is that

3101
02:32:40,001 --> 02:32:43,180
it's assumed that you only have that 
respect if you don't have happiness.

3102
02:32:43,180 --> 02:32:44,013
That goes along with that.
I understand that there is some amount 

3103
02:32:46,061 --> 02:32:46,894
of sadness,
some amount of happiness is a weird 

3104
02:32:49,240 --> 02:32:50,073
feeling of loss,
so there's a lot of weird stuff that 

3105
02:32:51,791 --> 02:32:52,624
goes on.
Surprised,

3106
02:32:52,760 --> 02:32:56,230
and the reason I'm asking you is,
is that I had expected that I would have

3107
02:32:56,231 --> 02:33:00,580
the difficulty bears equals teddy bears.
I get past that.

3108
02:33:00,730 --> 02:33:04,570
I keep going around this whole thing.
Then when I finally got to the end,

3109
02:33:05,290 --> 02:33:06,123
it was just the.
There wasn't the right balance between 

3110
02:33:10,960 --> 02:33:13,270
sadness,
ecstatic elation.

3111
02:33:14,540 --> 02:33:16,130
It's hard.
It's hard to.

3112
02:33:16,160 --> 02:33:18,320
It's hard if you're not there 
experiencing it.

3113
02:33:18,630 --> 02:33:21,050
It's hard if you're not involved in this
hunt for many,

3114
02:33:21,051 --> 02:33:21,884
many days and it gets very difficult 
when and you don't know if it's ever 

3115
02:33:24,141 --> 02:33:27,020
going to happen,
but the bear hunting in particular,

3116
02:33:27,021 --> 02:33:31,580
especially over Bait,
is way more problematic psychologically.

3117
02:33:31,920 --> 02:33:32,753
No,
I think there's a really good argument 

3118
02:33:35,121 --> 02:33:39,050
and I support this argument that you 
must keep bear populations in control if

3119
02:33:39,051 --> 02:33:41,930
you want people and and all those other 
animals to live in harmony.

3120
02:33:41,931 --> 02:33:43,220
Got It.
Because if you don't,

3121
02:33:43,400 --> 02:33:44,233
there's nothing else that keeps your 
populations in control by that other 

3122
02:33:46,371 --> 02:33:50,150
than bigger bears.
Grizzly bears and grizzly bears and they

3123
02:33:50,151 --> 02:33:53,210
get out of hand our way scarier.
That's a real.

3124
02:33:53,240 --> 02:33:56,960
It's a real science,
real giant problem in terms of our,

3125
02:33:58,280 --> 02:34:01,190
our anthropomorphization of these 
animals,

3126
02:34:01,410 --> 02:34:02,243
you know,
attaching these human attributes and 

3127
02:34:03,741 --> 02:34:04,574
these human thoughts and thinking of 
them as our friends in the forest and 

3128
02:34:07,521 --> 02:34:09,620
then what they actually are the people 
that live out there.

3129
02:34:09,650 --> 02:34:10,483
No.
My guess is that if I went hunting with 

3130
02:34:13,191 --> 02:34:18,130
you,
I would expect to see elated after

3131
02:34:18,130 --> 02:34:21,820
three days of frustration on a,
on a good hunt.

3132
02:34:22,180 --> 02:34:26,200
I expect that you would use the kill 
responsibly,

3133
02:34:26,201 --> 02:34:29,140
that you would forgo certain kinds of 
Kilz.

3134
02:34:29,950 --> 02:34:32,440
I don't have any of those issues.
I think.

3135
02:34:32,860 --> 02:34:37,270
I think that where the issue is is that 
I wouldn't expect an unbalanced elation.

3136
02:34:37,870 --> 02:34:38,703
Yeah,
I understand what you're saying and 

3137
02:34:40,151 --> 02:34:43,540
especially an unbalanced elation when 
you're hunting over bait,

3138
02:34:43,910 --> 02:34:44,743
right?
For an animal that is not necessarily 

3139
02:34:46,991 --> 02:34:50,680
thought of in our culture as being an 
animal that you eat,

3140
02:34:50,950 --> 02:34:54,070
which is bear and a lot of times people 
think that you don't eat them.

3141
02:34:54,160 --> 02:34:54,993
Black bears in particular actually,
they taste very good and people do eat 

3142
02:34:57,311 --> 02:34:59,830
them.
When you deal with people,

3143
02:34:59,831 --> 02:35:03,190
like I have friends,
my friend John and Jen Rivet who live in

3144
02:35:03,191 --> 02:35:06,010
Alberta and there they are hunting 
guides.

3145
02:35:06,370 --> 02:35:08,950
It's a real necessity up there to hunt 
bears.

3146
02:35:08,980 --> 02:35:09,310
Okay.

3147
02:35:09,310 --> 02:35:10,143
Because there is nothing else.
It's keeping their populations in check 

3148
02:35:11,951 --> 02:35:12,784
and if you ever go up there,
you see an extraordinary amount of 

3149
02:35:15,551 --> 02:35:17,410
bears.
Like you could see 19,

3150
02:35:17,411 --> 02:35:18,244
20 bears in a day.
Well they're everywhere and there's a 

3151
02:35:20,351 --> 02:35:24,100
high density of them and they just 
decimate the deer population.

3152
02:35:24,101 --> 02:35:24,934
They decimate the Moose population and 
there's some of them that learn that 

3153
02:35:28,631 --> 02:35:29,464
they can get into garbage cans,
they can break into people's cars and 

3154
02:35:31,961 --> 02:35:33,970
destroy them.
They've killed a few people,

3155
02:35:33,971 --> 02:35:34,804
but it's pretty rare.
Most of the time they realized that 

3156
02:35:36,431 --> 02:35:38,140
people are dangerous and they stay the 
fuck away,

3157
02:35:39,130 --> 02:35:39,963
but it's not what I.
What I appreciate his spot and stocking 

3158
02:35:45,670 --> 02:35:48,040
traditional prey animals.
That's what I like to do.

3159
02:35:48,100 --> 02:35:53,100
I like to spot and stalk deer and elk 
because I feel like first of all,

3160
02:35:53,381 --> 02:35:58,060
they're the most delicious they make.
Whether it makes sense or not,

3161
02:35:58,061 --> 02:36:01,630
they make the most sense to me in terms 
of like a prey animal.

3162
02:36:01,630 --> 02:36:02,463
They're the ones that I covet the most.
What I want to do is I want to go and 

3163
02:36:06,041 --> 02:36:09,910
get older,
mature animals that are undulates.

3164
02:36:10,150 --> 02:36:14,560
Whether it's a deer or an elk or the 
animal that has spread its genetics that

3165
02:36:14,561 --> 02:36:15,940
has already,
it's,

3166
02:36:15,960 --> 02:36:16,721
you know,
seven,

3167
02:36:16,721 --> 02:36:17,554
eight years old,
nine years old as animal that doesn't 

3168
02:36:19,391 --> 02:36:21,280
have much time left.
If you get it now,

3169
02:36:21,430 --> 02:36:23,920
you're probably getting it within a year
of its death.

3170
02:36:24,400 --> 02:36:26,520
Whether it's by natural causes,
wolves,

3171
02:36:26,550 --> 02:36:27,880
cold,
starvation,

3172
02:36:27,990 --> 02:36:31,930
you're.
You're doing it probably the most humane

3173
02:36:31,960 --> 02:36:33,700
you're giving it probably the most 
humane death.

3174
02:36:33,701 --> 02:36:37,570
It's reasonably possible for this thing 
is unless it falls off a cliff,

3175
02:36:38,080 --> 02:36:38,913
and even then it's the.
It might survive that for a little 

3176
02:36:41,861 --> 02:36:42,694
while.
When you're shooting an animal with an 

3177
02:36:43,721 --> 02:36:45,280
Arrow,
it's dead in seconds.

3178
02:36:45,770 --> 02:36:49,390
You know,
you hit it in the heart and they shot an

3179
02:36:49,391 --> 02:36:50,224
elk this year.
It literally walked four yards and 

3180
02:36:52,421 --> 02:36:54,040
tipped over it.
Just step,

3181
02:36:54,041 --> 02:36:55,030
step,
step,

3182
02:36:55,031 --> 02:36:55,864
boom.
I'm very impressed with the skill of 

3183
02:36:58,121 --> 02:36:58,954
some of these.
I guess this is the print primitive 

3184
02:37:00,851 --> 02:37:03,670
hunting movement with spears and see 
that's.

3185
02:37:07,060 --> 02:37:07,893
I think you should.
I think it should be really careful 

3186
02:37:11,530 --> 02:37:15,130
about anything that you do.
That's not that accurate.

3187
02:37:15,170 --> 02:37:16,003
That's.
That's

3188
02:37:16,040 --> 02:37:17,070
an issue.
Yeah.

3189
02:37:17,090 --> 02:37:20,300
That's a giant issue.
Aba bowser extremely accurate,

3190
02:37:20,301 --> 02:37:21,134
right?
I mean there's guys that can shoot a 

3191
02:37:23,061 --> 02:37:26,330
paper plate at 100,
20 yards every single time.

3192
02:37:26,780 --> 02:37:29,360
They could shoot a a good,
a little plate like that.

3193
02:37:29,690 --> 02:37:30,523
They'll.
They'll bet their life that could drop 

3194
02:37:31,851 --> 02:37:34,550
an Arrow into that at 120 yards every 
single time.

3195
02:37:34,551 --> 02:37:35,384
You can get good at that.
You can get if you have good technique 

3196
02:37:37,791 --> 02:37:41,780
and reasonable control of your emotions 
and your anxiety in the heart,

3197
02:37:41,781 --> 02:37:42,614
in the heat of the moment.
You don't ever shoot anything in 120 

3198
02:37:44,571 --> 02:37:46,700
yards though.
You shooting at things 30 yards,

3199
02:37:46,730 --> 02:37:51,730
40 yards and the degree of success is 
very high with skilled hunters.

3200
02:37:52,590 --> 02:37:55,820
If you are ethical and the shy,
they're shot decisions.

3201
02:37:56,660 --> 02:37:58,190
That primitive stuff.
It's like,

3202
02:37:58,191 --> 02:38:00,620
why?
Why you throwing spears like,

3203
02:38:00,621 --> 02:38:01,454
what are you doing?
You're trying to prove that you're 

3204
02:38:02,841 --> 02:38:04,610
better than people that use a bow and 
Arrow,

3205
02:38:04,611 --> 02:38:07,550
like this is not an accurate or 
effective thing.

3206
02:38:07,850 --> 02:38:10,910
I mean it kind of is,
but you have to be like five yards,

3207
02:38:10,940 --> 02:38:13,550
10 yards.
What do you got to be 15 yards Max.

3208
02:38:13,670 --> 02:38:14,503
Even then,
I think part of the thrill of it for 

3209
02:38:15,561 --> 02:38:18,890
them is putting themselves in danger.
There's a little bit of that.

3210
02:38:20,030 --> 02:38:20,870
If you're shooting,
oh,

3211
02:38:20,890 --> 02:38:22,730
you're going after a bear.
Yeah.

3212
02:38:23,080 --> 02:38:23,913
Like I've seen some of these things 
filmed where the person looks like 

3213
02:38:27,320 --> 02:38:29,090
they're up in there.
I don't know what to call it,

3214
02:38:29,091 --> 02:38:29,924
their little treestand Tristan,
and that doesn't look like they're 

3215
02:38:34,191 --> 02:38:35,024
putting a lot of risks,
but some of these people are clearly 

3216
02:38:36,771 --> 02:38:40,100
getting off on this is the primal hunt.
Right,

3217
02:38:40,160 --> 02:38:40,993
and this is.
They're going backwards into something 

3218
02:38:44,331 --> 02:38:49,070
where the animal could surprise them.
And what I.

3219
02:38:49,130 --> 02:38:52,820
What I wanted to do is I wanted to 
reacquaint myself with,

3220
02:38:53,040 --> 02:38:54,410
you know,
now that I can,

3221
02:38:54,470 --> 02:38:55,550
I can watch somebody.

3222
02:38:55,550 --> 02:38:56,930
Actually,
in that moment,

3223
02:38:57,560 --> 02:39:01,520
I'm trying to figure out what my ethics 
around hunting were and I thought that I

3224
02:39:01,521 --> 02:39:04,590
had prepared myself and I just,
I thought when I,

3225
02:39:04,640 --> 02:39:06,060
when I saw you,
um,

3226
02:39:06,560 --> 02:39:10,550
find out where joe is because I have no 
question.

3227
02:39:10,880 --> 02:39:11,713
Knowing your ethics and how you think 
that you would have a very subtle 

3228
02:39:15,651 --> 02:39:17,990
perspective on all these different kinds
of kills.

3229
02:39:17,991 --> 02:39:20,060
Which sorts of animals.
Yeah.

3230
02:39:20,061 --> 02:39:23,750
If you get to spears,
you're in a weird place.

3231
02:39:24,490 --> 02:39:25,970
Like,
like you say,

3232
02:39:25,971 --> 02:39:27,590
oh,
I only spear wild pigs.

3233
02:39:27,620 --> 02:39:29,480
We're trying to get rid of many way.
Okay,

3234
02:39:29,760 --> 02:39:30,593
well that's.
We're in a weird place where in a weird 

3235
02:39:32,421 --> 02:39:35,420
place because ethically I think you have
two choices.

3236
02:39:35,421 --> 02:39:38,390
Three choices.
Your three choices are rifle,

3237
02:39:38,420 --> 02:39:41,810
which is number one,
ethically realistically,

3238
02:39:42,230 --> 02:39:44,510
because if you shoot something with a 
rifle,

3239
02:39:44,530 --> 02:39:47,030
you,
you can be really accurate,

3240
02:39:47,450 --> 02:39:48,283
uh,
like out to 100 yards a hundred percent 

3241
02:39:50,721 --> 02:39:51,554
of the time.
Like unless it's crazy windy out or 

3242
02:39:53,721 --> 02:39:54,554
there's some weird conditions,
altitude can affect ballistics but not 

3243
02:39:58,581 --> 02:40:02,090
that much out to 100 yards.
You're fucking deadly.

3244
02:40:02,091 --> 02:40:04,330
If you have a really good control,
squeezing,

3245
02:40:04,370 --> 02:40:05,203
squeezing the trigger,
you're not jerking everything and not 

3246
02:40:06,621 --> 02:40:09,530
panicking,
then Beau is second,

3247
02:40:10,160 --> 02:40:10,881
you know,
blow.

3248
02:40:10,881 --> 02:40:14,250
It requires way more practice way,
way more,

3249
02:40:14,280 --> 02:40:18,240
a fine tuning of your motor skills,
but it's still possible.

3250
02:40:18,260 --> 02:40:19,770
Okay.
Then you have crossbow,

3251
02:40:19,800 --> 02:40:22,950
which is even more effective than a bow,
faster,

3252
02:40:23,460 --> 02:40:24,293
more feet per second,
faster feet per second so that it 

3253
02:40:26,311 --> 02:40:29,490
travels at a flat line because it's 
going quicker before it drops.

3254
02:40:29,491 --> 02:40:31,260
They all drop at the same speed,
right?

3255
02:40:31,560 --> 02:40:34,650
Bullets and arrows all drop at the same 
speed.

3256
02:40:34,770 --> 02:40:36,510
They just don't get there at the same 
speed,

3257
02:40:36,760 --> 02:40:37,593
so the same amount of time,
like if I'm shooting something at a 

3258
02:40:40,320 --> 02:40:43,860
hundred yards with a bow I am aiming 
with,

3259
02:40:43,910 --> 02:40:44,743
with a site that is calculating for the 
fact that the Arrow is going to drop 

3260
02:40:48,361 --> 02:40:49,194
significantly in the time that it takes.
If it's going 280 feet per second is 

3261
02:40:55,021 --> 02:40:59,490
like a normal speed for a good bow.
The good heavy Arrow that's 280 feet per

3262
02:40:59,491 --> 02:41:00,324
second that goes a hundred yards.
A bullet is going to go 100 yards far 

3263
02:41:04,771 --> 02:41:05,604
quicker,
but in the same amount of time it takes 

3264
02:41:07,531 --> 02:41:09,030
that Arrow to get to that target.

3265
02:41:09,060 --> 02:41:12,120
The bullet is going to drop the same 
amount as the Arrow and that's what most

3266
02:41:12,121 --> 02:41:12,954
people don't understand,
so across crossbow is more ethical 

3267
02:41:16,770 --> 02:41:20,880
because it's more accurate.
It's have fewer moving parts.

3268
02:41:20,881 --> 02:41:21,714
You could actually sit it on a rest and 
just squeeze the trigger easier to 

3269
02:41:24,661 --> 02:41:25,494
manipulate and the the Arrow is 
traveling faster so it's called a bolt 

3270
02:41:28,920 --> 02:41:29,753
traveling faster so it'll drop less 
after that chick gets squirrely after 

3271
02:41:35,011 --> 02:41:36,510
that.
It's like you're throwing spears.

3272
02:41:36,750 --> 02:41:37,620
Okay.
You got what do you got?

3273
02:41:37,621 --> 02:41:39,030
An adult adol.
Okay.

3274
02:41:39,090 --> 02:41:39,923
All right.
Well you can kill things with it and 

3275
02:41:41,821 --> 02:41:43,590
people have done it,
but it gets to.

3276
02:41:44,340 --> 02:41:46,330
How accurate are you and it.
What is.

3277
02:41:46,350 --> 02:41:47,183
What's your ethical brain like?
An ethical range for a really good 

3278
02:41:49,531 --> 02:41:52,290
hunter with a bow and arrow is probably 
80 yards.

3279
02:41:52,670 --> 02:41:53,400
I.
It may be.

3280
02:41:53,400 --> 02:41:55,110
Maybe it's a moose,
90 yards,

3281
02:41:55,111 --> 02:41:59,010
something big,
but with a spear like what do you got?

3282
02:41:59,400 --> 02:42:04,330
You got 10 yards so you know why?
That's the question.

3283
02:42:04,660 --> 02:42:07,140
Are you doing it for meat?
Are you doing it because,

3284
02:42:07,150 --> 02:42:08,730
um,
is this your Mount Everest?

3285
02:42:08,760 --> 02:42:09,593
You want to kill a pig with a spear?
And Are you saying that a pig is not 

3286
02:42:13,081 --> 02:42:13,914
worth as much?
So you should be able to kill it with a 

3287
02:42:14,851 --> 02:42:17,580
spear because these are all weird,
weird decision.

3288
02:42:17,610 --> 02:42:21,240
Just that weird decisions and people 
make those with bears.

3289
02:42:21,300 --> 02:42:23,130
They make those decisions with black 
bears,

3290
02:42:23,220 --> 02:42:26,070
like people that live where they 
consider them nuisances.

3291
02:42:26,380 --> 02:42:27,090
Th,
they,

3292
02:42:27,090 --> 02:42:27,923
they killed them.
I mean they used to be used to allow 

3293
02:42:29,610 --> 02:42:32,400
them to shoot a,
you still allowed to hunt,

3294
02:42:32,640 --> 02:42:37,040
used to be allowed to hunt black bears 
with a spear in Alberta until uh,

3295
02:42:37,041 --> 02:42:42,041
a big scandal a couple of years ago 
where a guy filmed himself doing that.

3296
02:42:42,721 --> 02:42:45,510
He shot a bear.
He killed a bear rather with a spear and

3297
02:42:45,511 --> 02:42:46,344
was hooting and hollering and people got
a hold of the video and thought it was 

3298
02:42:49,651 --> 02:42:51,990
disgusting and protested it.
And then,

3299
02:42:52,070 --> 02:42:53,010
uh,
people,

3300
02:42:53,011 --> 02:42:56,090
uh,
from underarmour dropped his,

3301
02:42:56,091 --> 02:42:57,930
uh,
wife from there,

3302
02:42:57,980 --> 02:42:58,813
you know,
they had this sort of sponsorship deal 

3303
02:43:00,571 --> 02:43:02,770
with them and uh,
it,

3304
02:43:02,780 --> 02:43:04,190
it,
it ignited,

3305
02:43:04,191 --> 02:43:06,150
it caused a rift in the hunting 
community.

3306
02:43:06,180 --> 02:43:08,440
Some people think you should be able to 
hunt with a rock here,

3307
02:43:08,480 --> 02:43:11,120
what you hunt with Sheila Hunt with 
anything and other people like,

3308
02:43:11,430 --> 02:43:12,490
hmm,
okay,

3309
02:43:12,580 --> 02:43:16,900
but what are we doing?
Are we just going out to get meat or are

3310
02:43:16,901 --> 02:43:19,730
we putting on a macho performance of 
our.

3311
02:43:19,850 --> 02:43:22,280
But this is exactly what I wanted to get
at,

3312
02:43:22,281 --> 02:43:23,114
which is if you know that the population
has to be controlled and you want the 

3313
02:43:26,781 --> 02:43:27,830
meat,
yeah,

3314
02:43:28,430 --> 02:43:29,263
then it makes sense to me that you have 
to open yourself up to some of the 

3315
02:43:31,611 --> 02:43:33,830
pleasure of the kill.
That makes some sense.

3316
02:43:34,370 --> 02:43:38,760
But what I saw just like flipped me out 
because if it wasn't a,

3317
02:43:38,870 --> 02:43:40,520
it was,
it was above and beyond.

3318
02:43:40,521 --> 02:43:41,354
Yeah.
I saw spirit and other things and you 

3319
02:43:43,851 --> 02:43:44,960
know,
I was impressed by the,

3320
02:43:44,961 --> 02:43:47,360
some of the skill.
I'm impressed by some of the bravery,

3321
02:43:48,160 --> 02:43:52,280
but like why doing it to population 
control,

3322
02:43:52,281 --> 02:43:54,640
you're doing it for the middle.
This was a surprise to me is that I got,

3323
02:43:54,790 --> 02:43:58,040
I got kind of sickened by it.
That's not surprising.

3324
02:43:58,580 --> 02:44:00,260
It's not surprising,
you know,

3325
02:44:00,261 --> 02:44:01,640
I mean,
I think if you,

3326
02:44:02,970 --> 02:44:03,803
if you were there,
you'd probably be even more conflicted 

3327
02:44:06,600 --> 02:44:08,520
because you actually were there in the 
presence of the thing.

3328
02:44:08,521 --> 02:44:13,170
Dying,
watching bare die on video is one thing.

3329
02:44:13,171 --> 02:44:15,840
But being there alive when they die as a
completely different thing,

3330
02:44:16,690 --> 02:44:18,670
um,
it's,

3331
02:44:19,930 --> 02:44:23,320
it's,
it's a very complicated thing because we

3332
02:44:23,321 --> 02:44:24,820
have these deep set

3333
02:44:26,530 --> 02:44:31,060
emotional connections to certain animals
that my friend Steve Rinella,

3334
02:44:31,061 --> 02:44:36,000
who's going to be actually on tomorrow,
he calls them charismatic megafauna that

3335
02:44:36,010 --> 02:44:40,000
we have this different view of certain 
animals bears in particular.

3336
02:44:41,020 --> 02:44:44,260
But if you use the animal respectfully,
respectfully,

3337
02:44:44,261 --> 02:44:45,094
and you kill it ethically and you do.
I don't have any problem with hunting 

3338
02:44:47,861 --> 02:44:48,790
bears.
In fact,

3339
02:44:48,791 --> 02:44:52,780
I think it's actually,
it really is a necessary task.

3340
02:44:52,940 --> 02:44:56,230
It it's something that even if you don't
like to hunt bears,

3341
02:44:56,560 --> 02:44:58,510
if you're living in a place like 
Alberta,

3342
02:44:58,570 --> 02:45:01,390
you probably should hunt bears because 
you should do your part.

3343
02:45:01,420 --> 02:45:03,990
There's a lot of them out there and you 
know,

3344
02:45:04,070 --> 02:45:04,903
one of the things that becomes an 
interesting relationship is a 

3345
02:45:07,031 --> 02:45:07,864
relationship between the moose hunters 
and the deer hunters and the bear 

3346
02:45:10,600 --> 02:45:15,340
hunters that they have.
Kind of those smart ones have come to an

3347
02:45:15,341 --> 02:45:17,350
understanding that even if I don't hunt 
bear,

3348
02:45:17,351 --> 02:45:18,184
I need those people out there doing it,
but it's how do you do it and why you 

3349
02:45:23,030 --> 02:45:23,863
doing it.
I think I've seen animals die very 

3350
02:45:25,841 --> 02:45:27,790
quickly with the bone marrow.
They die very quickly.

3351
02:45:28,180 --> 02:45:29,800
I've never seen an animal die with a 
spear.

3352
02:45:30,310 --> 02:45:31,143
Don't think it's necessary,
but I don't want to be the person that 

3353
02:45:33,281 --> 02:45:34,114
tells you you can't do it.
If you have an ethical range of five 

3354
02:45:36,820 --> 02:45:37,653
yards and you only hunt,
bear with a spear at five yards and you 

3355
02:45:41,171 --> 02:45:43,150
kill it immediately,
you hit it and kill it.

3356
02:45:43,810 --> 02:45:46,870
You're right.
Then you're right based on the method.

3357
02:45:46,871 --> 02:45:50,470
It's based on what?
What are the ethical parameters around.

3358
02:45:50,630 --> 02:45:51,870
I appreciate it also,
so

3359
02:45:51,880 --> 02:45:52,713
I would kind of be a hypocrite because 
even though I can ethically kill 

3360
02:45:56,080 --> 02:45:58,900
something at 40 yards or just figuring 
out what the number is,

3361
02:45:58,901 --> 02:46:00,660
depending on the size of the animal,
right.

3362
02:46:01,160 --> 02:46:03,190
Um,
even though I can do that,

3363
02:46:03,191 --> 02:46:06,280
I can do it way easier with a rifle.
So why am I using a bow and Arrow?

3364
02:46:06,550 --> 02:46:09,950
Why do I want to make it more difficult?
Why am I making it more challenging?

3365
02:46:09,951 --> 02:46:11,930
Why am I requiring myself to practice

3366
02:46:12,230 --> 02:46:14,780
this questions?
You're very self aware.

3367
02:46:14,840 --> 02:46:15,673
It's a very important question to ask 
because if I was just doing it just for 

3368
02:46:18,651 --> 02:46:20,990
the meat,
I would probably use a rifle,

3369
02:46:21,020 --> 02:46:21,853
right?
Yeah.

3370
02:46:22,310 --> 02:46:23,091
Yeah.
I think that,

3371
02:46:23,091 --> 02:46:23,640
that,
that,

3372
02:46:23,640 --> 02:46:27,050
that part of it has to do with the 
primal association with the kill.

3373
02:46:27,380 --> 02:46:29,600
And then the key question is how do you 
want to indulge that?

3374
02:46:29,601 --> 02:46:30,920
What is the set and setting,
blah,

3375
02:46:30,921 --> 02:46:31,311
blah,
blah.

3376
02:46:31,311 --> 02:46:34,040
So that was the,
that was the thing that I found shocking

3377
02:46:34,041 --> 02:46:36,200
is that I had thought,
you know,

3378
02:46:36,201 --> 02:46:39,310
I understood something about the need to
control population.

3379
02:46:39,840 --> 02:46:42,590
It's the effect which really killed me 
on this thing.

3380
02:46:42,620 --> 02:46:43,280
Well,
again,

3381
02:46:43,280 --> 02:46:45,080
we're talking about bears,
you know,

3382
02:46:45,440 --> 02:46:47,810
as such as bears and other animals as 
well.

3383
02:46:47,850 --> 02:46:49,430
Yeah,
I mean I saw.

3384
02:46:52,340 --> 02:46:54,860
I don't want to focus more on it 
necessarily,

3385
02:46:54,861 --> 02:46:57,470
but it's just a question I had to ask 
you because I sort of.

3386
02:46:57,560 --> 02:47:00,320
I was very surprised by my own reaction.
Well,

3387
02:47:00,321 --> 02:47:03,080
a lot of people are taking issue.
My good friend Ben,

3388
02:47:03,081 --> 02:47:05,570
oh Brian,
who's a brilliant writer,

3389
02:47:05,571 --> 02:47:08,780
who's actually also a hunter,
is

3390
02:47:09,030 --> 02:47:13,350
advocating that people stopped taking 
what he calls grip and grins with a grip

3391
02:47:13,351 --> 02:47:15,330
and grin as like say,
if you shot a beautiful deer,

3392
02:47:15,331 --> 02:47:16,164
you're holding the deer up by the 
antlers and you're smiling and he's 

3393
02:47:18,721 --> 02:47:19,554
advocating that those photos are 
problematic because people who don't 

3394
02:47:21,961 --> 02:47:24,930
hunt look at it like you're some blood 
thirsty asshole.

3395
02:47:24,950 --> 02:47:28,470
That's super happy that something died.
And that's not.

3396
02:47:28,740 --> 02:47:33,450
Even though that's not how the people 
feel when they're taking those photos,

3397
02:47:33,660 --> 02:47:36,720
what there are as happy.
That something which is very difficult,

3398
02:47:36,721 --> 02:47:38,370
which you know,
especially with using a bow.

3399
02:47:38,580 --> 02:47:42,540
Most people go home empty handed.
It's it requires too much fitness,

3400
02:47:42,960 --> 02:47:43,793
physical fitness,
because you're going up and down these 

3401
02:47:45,001 --> 02:47:49,980
mountains and requires too much accuracy
and training and technique and archery.

3402
02:47:49,981 --> 02:47:52,170
Most people fuck it up and then there's 
dealing with anxiety.

3403
02:47:52,171 --> 02:47:53,004
Most people fuck it up,

3404
02:47:53,830 --> 02:47:54,663
but

3405
02:47:55,290 --> 02:47:59,280
after it's all over,
there's this great feeling of elation.

3406
02:47:59,340 --> 02:48:00,121
Right?
You did it.

3407
02:48:00,121 --> 02:48:01,800
I can't believe it came together.
Wow.

3408
02:48:01,801 --> 02:48:04,530
Because it was probably not going to 
come together and people get happy.

3409
02:48:04,780 --> 02:48:07,560
These are people again,
that already accept hunting.

3410
02:48:07,740 --> 02:48:08,573
Now if you take someone who is an animal
rights activist or someone who deeply 

3411
02:48:11,221 --> 02:48:13,320
appreciates animals and then you show 
them that photo,

3412
02:48:13,620 --> 02:48:16,800
they have a completely different 
association with what that photo means.

3413
02:48:16,801 --> 02:48:20,220
What that photo means is,
here's an asshole who's a trophy hunter.

3414
02:48:21,230 --> 02:48:26,230
Let me get my thing.
I don't know any species that celebrates

3415
02:48:28,040 --> 02:48:32,930
a kill for food with glee chips.
Do chosen.

3416
02:48:32,960 --> 02:48:33,793
Sorry.
Sorry.

3417
02:48:34,100 --> 02:48:35,030
You're right.
Yeah.

3418
02:48:35,150 --> 02:48:36,610
When they kill a monkey,
they get pretty happy.

3419
02:48:36,611 --> 02:48:39,170
Well then they do it socially and then 
they share it.

3420
02:48:39,630 --> 02:48:40,463
Uh,
you know,

3421
02:48:40,490 --> 02:48:43,290
through altruism,
they scream at each other in a.

3422
02:48:43,320 --> 02:48:46,370
So that's the ships are my least 
favorite species.

3423
02:48:46,371 --> 02:48:48,550
Almost evolved.
They're terrifying.

3424
02:48:49,510 --> 02:48:51,740
Yeah.
It terrifying little fuckers.

3425
02:48:52,520 --> 02:48:53,353
So we're.
Where do you think we are on the 

3426
02:48:54,351 --> 02:48:56,060
political front?
We haven't even touched that.

3427
02:48:56,390 --> 02:48:57,223
Um,
I think it's the same way as bowhunting 

3428
02:49:00,051 --> 02:49:03,330
versus spears rifles.
It's all,

3429
02:49:03,360 --> 02:49:05,420
there's this world's messy,
you know,

3430
02:49:05,450 --> 02:49:07,930
all these things are messy.
Do you see a way in which this

3431
02:49:08,370 --> 02:49:09,203
political epic comes to an end?
The only hope that I have is through 

3432
02:49:15,180 --> 02:49:20,180
reasonable dialog becoming an accepted 
and appreciated thing,

3433
02:49:21,031 --> 02:49:21,864
a celebrated thing,
and that this is possible that people 

3434
02:49:24,181 --> 02:49:25,014
can realize that there's some stupidity 
to this team mentality that we have is 

3435
02:49:29,461 --> 02:49:33,300
right versus left,
which is almost all a good percentage of

3436
02:49:33,301 --> 02:49:36,210
it is.
He's assumed identities,

3437
02:49:36,360 --> 02:49:36,871
right?
These,

3438
02:49:36,871 --> 02:49:37,704
uh,
these predetermined patterns that get 

3439
02:49:40,081 --> 02:49:43,500
adopted in order to,
as we first started talking about this,

3440
02:49:43,570 --> 02:49:46,860
in order to establish yourself as 
someone who's in a group,

3441
02:49:47,310 --> 02:49:51,120
you get accepted by this group and you 
see it left and right.

3442
02:49:51,121 --> 02:49:52,440
I mean,
I don't want to name any names,

3443
02:49:52,441 --> 02:49:54,120
but there's a bunch of people that do it
blatantly.

3444
02:49:54,360 --> 02:49:55,193
You see them and I've even seen them 
switched teams and you see them switch 

3445
02:49:57,901 --> 02:50:00,840
teams and I don't,
I don't buy the rationalizations when it

3446
02:50:00,841 --> 02:50:01,674
comes to ideology,
but I think is what they're doing is 

3447
02:50:02,851 --> 02:50:06,480
they're switching teams because they 
realized there's an end on this team and

3448
02:50:06,481 --> 02:50:08,370
they can just say this is the problem 
with the team.

3449
02:50:08,370 --> 02:50:12,030
I used to be on those fucking losers and
they're really benedict arnold,

3450
02:50:12,300 --> 02:50:13,133
right?
Like they probably have as much of an 

3451
02:50:16,051 --> 02:50:19,050
affinity to the ideas of one side.
Is it do the other side.

3452
02:50:19,290 --> 02:50:22,530
They just go all in on one side to get 
acceptance from the group.

3453
02:50:23,130 --> 02:50:23,963
You just no way.
People change their opinion that much 

3454
02:50:25,561 --> 02:50:26,394
over two years or something like that.
Or they just decide this group makes 

3455
02:50:29,791 --> 02:50:33,060
more sense now and I've been attacked by
people on the left so I'm going to go to

3456
02:50:33,061 --> 02:50:37,440
the right or vice verse and usually what
it is is when even when they say they've

3457
02:50:37,470 --> 02:50:38,161
been attacked,
like,

3458
02:50:38,161 --> 02:50:38,994
oh you fucking baby,
there's 300 million people just in this 

3459
02:50:42,061 --> 02:50:42,894
country alone.
If you put something out there publicly 

3460
02:50:45,210 --> 02:50:46,043
and a thousand people attack,
you don't act like you're being 

3461
02:50:47,911 --> 02:50:48,840
persecuted.
Okay?

3462
02:50:48,841 --> 02:50:50,220
You have an idea,
you've,

3463
02:50:50,250 --> 02:50:51,083
you've.
You've launched that idea out into the 

3464
02:50:53,071 --> 02:50:55,350
zeitgeists and people took a big shit on
it.

3465
02:50:55,620 --> 02:50:56,453
You know,
whether it's people on the right are 

3466
02:50:57,181 --> 02:50:58,014
people on the left.
You got to be able to argue your point 

3467
02:50:59,491 --> 02:51:00,324
one way or the other and not just 
immediately jumped ship on someone who 

3468
02:51:02,971 --> 02:51:03,804
shares ideas with you,
decides that your idea sucks and maybe 

3469
02:51:07,351 --> 02:51:10,830
they're wrong and maybe you're right,
but you've got to argue that through,

3470
02:51:10,920 --> 02:51:11,753
but this idea of these partisan patterns
that people just seem to automatically 

3471
02:51:16,951 --> 02:51:20,200
fall into there is so detrimental to 
dialogue there,

3472
02:51:20,220 --> 02:51:21,053
so detrimental to us under really 
understanding each other and really 

3473
02:51:23,671 --> 02:51:25,980
having some sort of a sense of 
community.

3474
02:51:25,981 --> 02:51:28,830
Right?
This is a giant community of 300 million

3475
02:51:28,831 --> 02:51:30,870
people.
That's what it's supposed to be and this

3476
02:51:30,871 --> 02:51:34,230
idea that it's this group is trying to 
fuck it up and they're trying to turn us

3477
02:51:34,231 --> 02:51:35,064
all Muslims and this one wants everybody
to be gay and this one wants everybody 

3478
02:51:38,071 --> 02:51:40,240
to fucking have free food and this and 
this.

3479
02:51:40,240 --> 02:51:42,120
This is nonsense.
This is nonsense.

3480
02:51:42,270 --> 02:51:46,350
We need better understanding and and you
know the word better.

3481
02:51:46,351 --> 02:51:47,184
Education gets tossed around a lot,
but it also means better social 

3482
02:51:49,801 --> 02:51:52,680
understanding,
better social education.

3483
02:51:52,830 --> 02:51:53,663
I got at appreciation of who we are and 
why we think the way we think and 

3484
02:51:56,941 --> 02:52:00,060
calling out weasels on both sides of the
pattern,

3485
02:52:00,360 --> 02:52:03,450
like calling out weasels on the right 
that are pandering,

3486
02:52:03,451 --> 02:52:04,284
that are just trying to get unit,
the repeating a lot of these like 

3487
02:52:07,330 --> 02:52:10,660
accepted beliefs because they know that 
they can hit this frequency and a lot of

3488
02:52:10,661 --> 02:52:13,990
people sing along or the same thing that
other people are doing on the left.

3489
02:52:14,200 --> 02:52:15,033
They're doing it on both sides.
I think most reasonable people have a 

3490
02:52:18,581 --> 02:52:19,414
collection of ideas that they share from
both the right and the left and most 

3491
02:52:22,691 --> 02:52:23,524
reasonable people are reasonably 
compassionate and I think that's one of 

3492
02:52:27,731 --> 02:52:32,731
the things that we're missing some 
reasonable sense of not just ethics,

3493
02:52:34,030 --> 02:52:39,030
but an appreciation for each other for 
all of us as a group and do that.

3494
02:52:41,350 --> 02:52:42,183
I think if we can celebrate reasonable 
conversations and celebrate and 

3495
02:52:46,631 --> 02:52:48,460
understanding of other people's 
perspectives,

3496
02:52:48,950 --> 02:52:51,760
be able to just look at how you're 
looking at things and have empathy.

3497
02:52:52,360 --> 02:52:53,890
Okay.
Let me see where you're coming from with

3498
02:52:53,891 --> 02:52:54,581
this.
Okay.

3499
02:52:54,581 --> 02:52:56,320
Let me put myself in your shoes.
Okay.

3500
02:52:56,321 --> 02:52:58,330
Instead of just immediately like,
fuck you,

3501
02:52:58,331 --> 02:53:00,800
you cook and fuck you,
you this.

3502
02:53:00,801 --> 02:53:03,100
And instead of thinking about it that 
way,

3503
02:53:03,250 --> 02:53:04,083
if we just tried to just everybody 
exercise a little bit more so we're a 

3504
02:53:08,231 --> 02:53:09,064
little bit more calm and come at this 
from a rational place and try to like 

3505
02:53:13,151 --> 02:53:13,984
realize like it's

3506
02:53:14,700 --> 02:53:15,533
exclusion.
I've been experimenting with a very 

3507
02:53:18,031 --> 02:53:20,040
dangerous idea.
I keep hearing,

3508
02:53:20,050 --> 02:53:20,883
but chief inclusion officers,
I thought about things from 

3509
02:53:26,470 --> 02:53:30,210
ecclesiasticus to every season.
There's a purpose under heaven.

3510
02:53:30,211 --> 02:53:31,044
So if there's inclusion,
there also has to be exclusion and like 

3511
02:53:35,130 --> 02:53:38,700
d platforming or unplanned forming 
somebody is an act of exclusion.

3512
02:53:38,701 --> 02:53:39,534
And very often it's very interesting 
that the people who are for inclusion 

3513
02:53:41,581 --> 02:53:43,890
are very focused on the need for deep 
platforming,

3514
02:53:43,891 --> 02:53:44,724
which is an act of exclusion.
So should we have chief exclusion 

3515
02:53:47,701 --> 02:53:52,110
officers that both monitor who is being 
excluded,

3516
02:53:52,111 --> 02:53:55,000
including somebody like James Demore,
uh,

3517
02:53:55,050 --> 02:53:59,280
at Google,
like is it ethical to exclude him or are

3518
02:53:59,281 --> 02:54:03,660
there certain voices that need to not be
at some tables in order for something to

3519
02:54:03,661 --> 02:54:04,494
make progress?
Because if you always have the voice 

3520
02:54:06,901 --> 02:54:10,050
that the most extreme that doesn't 
accept the game,

3521
02:54:10,080 --> 02:54:10,913
then it's very hard to move forward 
within the game if you're constantly 

3522
02:54:13,171 --> 02:54:14,820
being reminded,
you know.

3523
02:54:14,820 --> 02:54:17,090
So we had this,
um,

3524
02:54:17,670 --> 02:54:22,670
we have a series of situations in which 
it seems like some perspective that very

3525
02:54:23,491 --> 02:54:24,324
few people hold terrorizes majority's or
know group of people who sort of can 

3526
02:54:30,061 --> 02:54:30,894
more or less get along with each other 
and keeps pushing us into this very 

3527
02:54:34,741 --> 02:54:37,140
divided landscape.
And I was just curious,

3528
02:54:37,790 --> 02:54:40,720
you know,
in terms of our group of people that we,

3529
02:54:40,760 --> 02:54:44,280
we talk and hang out with a in common,
um,

3530
02:54:45,300 --> 02:54:47,500
where you see the high leverage,
uh,

3531
02:54:47,700 --> 02:54:50,060
is that we're,
we've just finished the midterm.

3532
02:54:50,110 --> 02:54:51,660
We've got this 20,
20 election.

3533
02:54:51,690 --> 02:54:52,523
It looks to me like Hillary is Kinda I 
in whether she wants to get back in the 

3534
02:54:56,131 --> 02:54:57,670
game.
Um,

3535
02:54:57,720 --> 02:55:00,540
this trump thing has completely,
uh,

3536
02:55:01,080 --> 02:55:01,800
you know,
it's like,

3537
02:55:01,800 --> 02:55:04,010
it's like the dress is it black and blue

3538
02:55:04,010 --> 02:55:04,843
or white and gold for like eight years.
And I just have you thought about how 

3539
02:55:12,081 --> 02:55:14,690
this ends?
Well,

3540
02:55:14,780 --> 02:55:15,613
I would never be so presumptuous to 
think that I have any idea how this 

3541
02:55:19,451 --> 02:55:20,620
ends.
I have,

3542
02:55:20,660 --> 02:55:25,660
I've proposed various scenarios to 
myself and I don't like any of them.

3543
02:55:26,660 --> 02:55:29,180
I don't like where it's going because 
what I worry about,

3544
02:55:29,240 --> 02:55:30,073
and this is also again hypocritical that
because I think it probably should burn 

3545
02:55:35,031 --> 02:55:39,640
down and be rebuilt from the ruins,
were not going to get such a clear thing

3546
02:55:39,900 --> 02:55:40,733
to be clean.
I know this isn't very clean either 

3547
02:55:42,831 --> 02:55:43,790
though.
Honestly.

3548
02:55:43,910 --> 02:55:45,920
It's that guy won.
It's not clean.

3549
02:55:47,150 --> 02:55:49,070
Have you heard this?
He loves Putin.

3550
02:55:49,250 --> 02:55:50,360
You know,
this ain't clean.

3551
02:55:50,550 --> 02:55:51,770
You know,
the whole thing is weird.

3552
02:55:51,771 --> 02:55:52,604
It's a,
the bankers having the amount of 

3553
02:55:53,931 --> 02:55:56,390
influence they have,
the fact that there's two lobbyists.

3554
02:55:56,391 --> 02:55:57,224
What is it?
What's the number like two lobbyists to 

3555
02:55:59,151 --> 02:55:59,984
every member of Congress or to lobbyists
to every senator for the pharmaceutical 

3556
02:56:04,581 --> 02:56:05,330
industry.

3557
02:56:05,330 --> 02:56:08,390
By the way,
the number of people that have influence

3558
02:56:08,391 --> 02:56:10,640
over the way.
Our laws are shaped.

3559
02:56:10,780 --> 02:56:13,220
It's so fucking bananas right now.
Right.

3560
02:56:13,221 --> 02:56:14,870
So,
so off the rails,

3561
02:56:15,680 --> 02:56:17,390
is that what it is?
Twelve,

3562
02:56:17,480 --> 02:56:18,313
but I didn't type in specifically,
but there's a 23 registered lobbyists 

3563
02:56:22,071 --> 02:56:23,360
for every member of.
No,

3564
02:56:23,361 --> 02:56:25,280
I think from the pharmaceutical 
industry,

3565
02:56:25,281 --> 02:56:26,114
they were saying not just,
I think it's two for every member of 

3566
02:56:28,401 --> 02:56:31,310
Congress in the pharmaceutical industry.
Um,

3567
02:56:31,790 --> 02:56:32,623
yeah.
The question that you started out with 

3568
02:56:34,160 --> 02:56:34,993
like d platforming people,
I think we're impatient and I think 

3569
02:56:40,190 --> 02:56:41,420
we're,
we're.

3570
02:56:41,480 --> 02:56:46,480
We really want to make sure that this 
vetting of ideas happens quickly because

3571
02:56:48,291 --> 02:56:50,060
we see the answer,
we,

3572
02:56:50,240 --> 02:56:53,900
we see the solution,
we see that this is incorrect and we see

3573
02:56:53,901 --> 02:56:55,270
these people that think the world is 
flat,

3574
02:56:55,271 --> 02:56:57,160
are idiots,
and we think that these people that this

3575
02:56:57,380 --> 02:57:00,680
I think this and think that we think 
they're all wrong and so we want to stop

3576
02:57:00,681 --> 02:57:03,530
them from talking,
but that doesn't work.

3577
02:57:04,100 --> 02:57:05,990
It just works for now.
It,

3578
02:57:05,991 --> 02:57:06,620
it,
it.

3579
02:57:06,620 --> 02:57:10,580
It oftentimes feeds those ideas and it 
also,

3580
02:57:11,090 --> 02:57:14,140
it it.
You have to question like,

3581
02:57:14,420 --> 02:57:19,420
why are you so sure why you showed so 
sure that you are correct that you want.

3582
02:57:20,570 --> 02:57:24,560
You don't just want your side to be 
heard exclusively.

3583
02:57:24,561 --> 02:57:27,500
You want to.
You want to silence these other people's

3584
02:57:27,501 --> 02:57:31,040
ability to participate in this argument,
even if they're totally wrong.

3585
02:57:32,000 --> 02:57:32,833
I think that's dangerous because I think
that the way to fight off ideas that 

3586
02:57:37,731 --> 02:57:40,520
aren't good is to introduce ideas that 
are good and you're gonna.

3587
02:57:40,580 --> 02:57:43,010
You're gonna have a bunch of people that
agree with ideas that are bad,

3588
02:57:43,670 --> 02:57:48,320
but I think that that's a part of this 
whole figuring things out,

3589
02:57:48,560 --> 02:57:52,370
like you need to have bad ideas floating
around there to appreciate good idea,

3590
02:57:52,371 --> 02:57:55,610
so if all the ideas are good,
like what do we do get it out against.

3591
02:57:56,060 --> 02:57:58,970
It's not bad to have these bad ideas 
broadcast.

3592
02:57:59,150 --> 02:58:00,890
What's bad?
To not have someone,

3593
02:58:01,380 --> 02:58:02,670
hey,
these are bad ideas,

3594
02:58:02,910 --> 02:58:05,250
but I need to see the pitfalls of 
racism.

3595
02:58:05,251 --> 02:58:06,084
We need to see the pitfalls of crime.
We need to see the pitfalls of 

3596
02:58:08,131 --> 02:58:10,080
corruption.
We need to see it in action.

3597
02:58:10,110 --> 02:58:12,120
I think it's like stock market,
swindling.

3598
02:58:12,240 --> 02:58:13,073
I think in a lot of ways it's important.
We need to understand that this is a 

3599
02:58:15,091 --> 02:58:15,924
pattern that people fall into 
continually over and over again when 

3600
02:58:18,061 --> 02:58:20,550
they have control over the money,
when they have control over the way they

3601
02:58:20,551 --> 02:58:22,290
move the numbers.
What do I do this?

3602
02:58:22,410 --> 02:58:23,243
How about if I tell you that this is 
going to go down and then you invest 

3603
02:58:24,691 --> 02:58:27,510
some money and I put some money in your 
bank and we work together.

3604
02:58:27,660 --> 02:58:29,750
Let's make some money because what 
people do right,

3605
02:58:29,760 --> 02:58:31,770
if they just fucking do it over and over
and over again,

3606
02:58:31,980 --> 02:58:32,850
should you punish them?

3607
02:58:32,910 --> 02:58:34,260
Yes,
absolutely.

3608
02:58:34,560 --> 02:58:39,560
But I think it's kind of important to 
see some fucked up behavior just because

3609
02:58:40,890 --> 02:58:41,723
we're not done.
We're still in some sort of emotional 

3610
02:58:44,701 --> 02:58:47,790
and psychological and even physical 
evolution.

3611
02:58:47,791 --> 02:58:48,624
We're in the middle of this thing and I 
think that bad ideas facilitate 

3612
02:58:52,651 --> 02:58:53,484
comprehension,
like these really shitty ideas that a 

3613
02:58:55,771 --> 02:58:56,604
lot of people have.
What they do is they facilitate a 

3614
02:58:58,201 --> 02:58:59,034
comprehension of why we think dumb shit.
And sometimes you don't know why people 

3615
02:59:03,181 --> 02:59:04,014
think dumb shit until you see someone 
over and over again that thinks dumb 

3616
02:59:06,271 --> 02:59:07,104
shit and you get to see that,
whether it's Alex Jones or whether it's 

3617
02:59:09,211 --> 02:59:11,340
to fill in the blank,
what guide you want deep,

3618
02:59:11,520 --> 02:59:12,550
but I don't.
Okay,

3619
02:59:12,600 --> 02:59:15,750
so here's my thing.
I want a lot of our leading experts,

3620
02:59:16,170 --> 02:59:18,330
the platform.
Okay,

3621
02:59:18,510 --> 02:59:19,343
well,
you're going deep.

3622
02:59:19,560 --> 02:59:23,910
The spray paint fucking big a on Tucker 
Carlson's driveway.

3623
02:59:25,510 --> 02:59:26,830
We mean,
well,

3624
02:59:28,870 --> 02:59:31,060
if I think about who the great danger 
is,

3625
02:59:31,400 --> 02:59:33,240
is that Alex Jones,
uh,

3626
02:59:33,280 --> 02:59:35,920
you know,
who veers towards tin foil hat land with

3627
02:59:35,921 --> 02:59:39,610
some frequency,
or is it the people who were selling,

3628
02:59:39,630 --> 02:59:41,770
you know,
weapons of mass destruction in Iraq as a

3629
02:59:41,771 --> 02:59:45,730
response to nine slash 11 or you know,
the people,

3630
02:59:46,210 --> 02:59:50,200
let's assume that you're a reasonable 
person on immigration,

3631
02:59:50,560 --> 02:59:53,290
you neither think that borders should be
opened or closed.

3632
02:59:53,950 --> 02:59:56,950
Um,
then you start hearing professors say,

3633
02:59:56,951 --> 02:59:57,784
you know,
the great thing about immigration is 

3634
02:59:58,480 --> 02:59:59,313
that it has absolutely no costs and all 
of them are better than all of our 

3635
03:00:01,541 --> 03:00:03,030
people because,
uh,

3636
03:00:03,270 --> 03:00:04,360
you know,
they're highly trained,

3637
03:00:04,361 --> 03:00:05,800
they're highly motivated,
they're young.

3638
03:00:06,280 --> 03:00:08,140
You're thinking like,
okay,

3639
03:00:08,141 --> 03:00:11,050
what kind of thing has all benefits and 
no costs.

3640
03:00:11,051 --> 03:00:11,884
You're not,
you're not even entering into rational 

3641
03:00:13,511 --> 03:00:14,344
description and now we're hearing like 
all these trade deals that got 

3642
03:00:16,451 --> 03:00:17,320
negotiated.

3643
03:00:17,890 --> 03:00:19,330
Yeah,
that Kinda wasn't true.

3644
03:00:19,360 --> 03:00:20,970
All those things that we were telling 
you that if you,

3645
03:00:20,971 --> 03:00:21,804
if you question these things,
you are backward protectionist and you 

3646
03:00:24,071 --> 03:00:24,904
were just,
you were stuck in the old world and you 

3647
03:00:26,501 --> 03:00:27,990
couldn't embrace the new.
Yeah,

3648
03:00:28,000 --> 03:00:29,860
that was all bullshit.
Um,

3649
03:00:30,520 --> 03:00:33,580
what I think is we have a crisis and 
expertise,

3650
03:00:33,610 --> 03:00:36,550
institutional expertise,
uh,

3651
03:00:36,850 --> 03:00:37,683
is at an all time low.
Nobody really trusts any of our 

3652
03:00:40,841 --> 03:00:44,710
institutions to be an authoritative 
source of ground truth.

3653
03:00:45,040 --> 03:00:45,873
It's not to say that everything that the
institution say is wrong or everything 

3654
03:00:49,091 --> 03:00:50,710
the experts say is wrong,
far from it.

3655
03:00:51,070 --> 03:00:51,903
It's just that there are almost no 
experts or institutions that aren't 

3656
03:00:54,221 --> 03:00:55,054
willing to distort facts in order to 
pursue institutional goals that does a 

3657
03:00:59,741 --> 03:01:01,030
giant issue.
Right?

3658
03:01:01,330 --> 03:01:02,163
Right.
And so I don't actually want a diy 

3659
03:01:03,440 --> 03:01:04,540
platform,
these people,

3660
03:01:04,541 --> 03:01:06,700
but I do have the very strong sense,
you know,

3661
03:01:06,701 --> 03:01:07,180
when,
when I,

3662
03:01:07,180 --> 03:01:10,750
when Elon came on your show and Peter 
Teal,

3663
03:01:10,960 --> 03:01:11,793
um,
my friend and boss came on Dave Rubin 

3664
03:01:13,611 --> 03:01:14,320
show.

3665
03:01:14,320 --> 03:01:18,970
I thought that was quite a moment where 
this alternate network of distribution,

3666
03:01:19,240 --> 03:01:20,073
which is not under centralized control,
started to be seen as comparably 

3667
03:01:24,611 --> 03:01:25,444
powerful and important.
And I think some of the noises that 

3668
03:01:27,641 --> 03:01:30,940
Tucker Carlson just made to Dave Ruben 
about,

3669
03:01:30,941 --> 03:01:31,480
well,
hey,

3670
03:01:31,480 --> 03:01:35,170
you're doing this out of your garage and
you have the freedom to do anything.

3671
03:01:35,171 --> 03:01:38,050
I'm,
I'm beholden to the structure in which I

3672
03:01:38,051 --> 03:01:43,051
live word a very interesting place with 
respect to what is this thing,

3673
03:01:45,850 --> 03:01:48,720
uh,
this alternate distribution network for,

3674
03:01:48,760 --> 03:01:52,240
for ideas that's unpolished by the 
institutions.

3675
03:01:52,690 --> 03:01:56,470
And I think I've been convinced in the 
last two days that I need.

3676
03:01:56,970 --> 03:01:59,170
This is advice that I got from you at 
the beginning.

3677
03:01:59,171 --> 03:02:00,004
You said you need to start a podcast.
I think I need to start a podcast and I 

3678
03:02:03,071 --> 03:02:03,904
think you need to start a podcast just 
to keep going on about the hop thing 

3679
03:02:07,420 --> 03:02:09,880
until people figured it out just about 
the hot thing,

3680
03:02:10,650 --> 03:02:15,650
but we have to,
we have to return to some kind of stable

3681
03:02:15,761 --> 03:02:16,594
sanity that I'm positive that the 
institutions can't return us to because 

3682
03:02:20,180 --> 03:02:22,540
the,
the institutional interests,

3683
03:02:23,170 --> 03:02:24,003
uh,
really have to do with the fact that 

3684
03:02:25,451 --> 03:02:28,000
certain kinds of growth on which they're
predicated,

3685
03:02:28,001 --> 03:02:30,340
their existence is predicated if 
evaporated.

3686
03:02:30,820 --> 03:02:31,653
So all of these institutions are 
extremely vulnerable to corruption at 

3687
03:02:36,851 --> 03:02:39,800
the moment.
And the real revolution as I'm seeing it

3688
03:02:40,300 --> 03:02:44,080
is that high agency individuals are out 
competing,

3689
03:02:44,081 --> 03:02:46,780
traditional institutional structures,
um,

3690
03:02:47,110 --> 03:02:47,943
in terms of mind share and some of those
high agency individuals are 

3691
03:02:50,501 --> 03:02:52,150
irresponsible,
you know,

3692
03:02:52,160 --> 03:02:52,993
they're like Milo types that are kind of
trying to light things up and some of 

3693
03:02:56,501 --> 03:02:59,020
them are extremely responsible and some 
of them,

3694
03:02:59,490 --> 03:03:00,323
you know,
we'll do a few irresponsible things but 

3695
03:03:01,421 --> 03:03:06,040
will self correct.
And this new world that is being born is

3696
03:03:06,041 --> 03:03:09,340
a huge check on the institutions,
but it's still largely separate.

3697
03:03:09,341 --> 03:03:10,174
Like,
am I right that you don't do a lot of 

3698
03:03:11,080 --> 03:03:12,780
network television?
Oh yeah.

3699
03:03:13,750 --> 03:03:14,950
Anymore.
But I used to.

3700
03:03:15,370 --> 03:03:17,860
I mean that's how I became famous in the
first place.

3701
03:03:17,861 --> 03:03:19,210
Right.
You know?

3702
03:03:19,590 --> 03:03:20,381
Um,
but yeah,

3703
03:03:20,381 --> 03:03:21,214
I don't do it anymore,
but it's also because there's nothing 

3704
03:03:22,571 --> 03:03:23,770
fun out there like this.

3705
03:03:24,490 --> 03:03:26,770
Like there's no place for this.
Right.

3706
03:03:26,800 --> 03:03:27,633
Other than this,
this is the only place you could do 

3707
03:03:28,751 --> 03:03:29,584
this,
but isn't it interesting to you that we 

3708
03:03:31,720 --> 03:03:36,720
still have not like Jordan had to be 
dealt with by the mainstream because the

3709
03:03:38,501 --> 03:03:41,440
book was too big.
His affect was too large.

3710
03:03:42,160 --> 03:03:45,940
I think his effect on the Internet is 
bigger than the book.

3711
03:03:46,140 --> 03:03:47,030
Yeah.
Think the,

3712
03:03:47,040 --> 03:03:50,050
the youtube videos and the debates that 
he has.

3713
03:03:50,051 --> 03:03:52,540
The one that I was telling you,
the recent one interview with Gq,

3714
03:03:52,570 --> 03:03:54,100
so interesting.
It's really good.

3715
03:03:54,340 --> 03:03:55,173
The woman's very smart,
but she gets trounced and it's because 

3716
03:03:57,681 --> 03:03:58,280
he's been

3717
03:03:58,280 --> 03:04:01,430
in the trenches with this stuff for a 
long time.

3718
03:04:01,670 --> 03:04:02,960
I mean he,
he's,

3719
03:04:03,020 --> 03:04:03,853
he's fighting a very strange fight of 
dialogue and have interpretation of 

3720
03:04:07,550 --> 03:04:08,383
discussion and,
and the freedom of intellectual 

3721
03:04:13,881 --> 03:04:15,290
sovereignty.
You know,

3722
03:04:15,291 --> 03:04:20,030
there's a lot of people that want you to
think a very certain way and use certain

3723
03:04:20,031 --> 03:04:25,010
words and say certain things and it 
doesn't matter whether or not you are in

3724
03:04:25,040 --> 03:04:28,430
fact racist or sexist or homophobic or 
whatever.

3725
03:04:28,440 --> 03:04:32,750
There's a weird battle of control going 
on that it's a heart of it as much as it

3726
03:04:32,751 --> 03:04:33,584
is a battle of inclusion and diversity 
and strengthening our overall 

3727
03:04:37,791 --> 03:04:40,520
progressive mindset.
There's a little bit of that too,

3728
03:04:40,700 --> 03:04:41,533
but there's also an undeniable game 
that's being played and people want to 

3729
03:04:44,451 --> 03:04:46,670
win their scores.
They're being scored.

3730
03:04:46,671 --> 03:04:49,280
There's points on the board that 
throwing in new agents,

3731
03:04:49,281 --> 03:04:50,114
they have teams going at it and whenever
Jordan goes on one of these 

3732
03:04:52,761 --> 03:04:55,970
conversations,
these video interviews and as a feminist

3733
03:04:56,150 --> 03:04:58,640
and Jordan Peterson like,
there's a fucking game going on.

3734
03:04:58,640 --> 03:05:01,730
We're watching a soccer match.
We're watching a wrestling match.

3735
03:05:01,731 --> 03:05:05,810
This is Jujitsu there.
They're playing intellectual Jujitsu and

3736
03:05:05,811 --> 03:05:09,020
Jordan's really good at tapping people.
He's really good at and they get pissed.

3737
03:05:09,021 --> 03:05:13,460
They keep sending in new chicks.
They said that Kathy Newman Lady,

3738
03:05:13,461 --> 03:05:14,294
and she's like,
so what you're saying is that didn't 

3739
03:05:15,801 --> 03:05:16,450
work.
Either.

3740
03:05:16,450 --> 03:05:17,283
She just got devastated.
She got rocked and this is what's 

3741
03:05:19,821 --> 03:05:23,750
happening over and over and over again 
because whether you appreciate what he's

3742
03:05:23,751 --> 03:05:28,700
saying or not,
he has some facts that are undeniable.

3743
03:05:28,820 --> 03:05:29,653
He has some positions that are based on 
a rich understanding of history and of 

3744
03:05:32,301 --> 03:05:33,134
Marxism and communism and have a lot of 
the problems with people with compelled 

3745
03:05:40,010 --> 03:05:40,843
thoughts.
If you're compelling people to behave a 

3746
03:05:42,681 --> 03:05:45,170
certain way,
compelling people to talk a certain way,

3747
03:05:45,380 --> 03:05:50,300
and we're not talking about compelling 
people to not commit crimes or violence.

3748
03:05:50,570 --> 03:05:53,300
We're talking about weird things like 
compelled

3749
03:05:53,690 --> 03:05:54,523
pronouns and so if I take,
if I take your analogy because you 

3750
03:05:56,901 --> 03:06:00,590
brought it up that he's like doing 
Jujitsu,

3751
03:06:01,400 --> 03:06:06,400
so in some previous era I thought your 
description of the early days of mma was

3752
03:06:06,891 --> 03:06:10,190
fascinating that we just didn't know 
what fighting was,

3753
03:06:10,670 --> 03:06:11,503
so we didn't know who would win or what 
systems worked and if you think about 

3754
03:06:14,601 --> 03:06:15,434
the mainstream media is like a to some 
system that maybe has some valid 

3755
03:06:22,340 --> 03:06:23,173
validity in some very rarefied context 
and it comes into general purpose 

3756
03:06:27,471 --> 03:06:32,000
fighting systems and it's.
It's dismantled very quickly.

3757
03:06:32,540 --> 03:06:37,540
So now we have this weird situation that
we've got this new world of kind of rule

3758
03:06:40,611 --> 03:06:41,444
laden.
Anything goes discussions more or less 

3759
03:06:44,150 --> 03:06:44,983
and the mainstream world doesn't want.
Like the Akita world doesn't want to 

3760
03:06:47,811 --> 03:06:50,750
acknowledge that this weird ufc type 
thing is happening.

3761
03:06:52,250 --> 03:06:55,350
How long does that go on for?
It goes on for as long as it takes.

3762
03:06:55,560 --> 03:06:56,070
And this is

3763
03:06:56,070 --> 03:06:59,130
similar to I think,
the what's happening intellectually,

3764
03:06:59,190 --> 03:07:00,023
and this is one of the reasons why I 
don't think you should stop people from 

3765
03:07:02,371 --> 03:07:05,310
expressing these bad ideas,
is one thing for stopping people to say,

3766
03:07:05,311 --> 03:07:06,630
hey,
we need to kill black people.

3767
03:07:06,720 --> 03:07:08,370
Stopping people said we need to kill 
white people.

3768
03:07:08,371 --> 03:07:09,630
We need to kill.
Fill in the blank.

3769
03:07:09,631 --> 03:07:10,680
Whatever the group is.
Yeah,

3770
03:07:10,681 --> 03:07:12,000
that's,
that's different.

3771
03:07:12,060 --> 03:07:12,600
You're,
you're,

3772
03:07:12,600 --> 03:07:13,433
you're clearly stepping outside of the 
realm of civilization and into war and 

3773
03:07:18,901 --> 03:07:21,710
violence.
And we could all collectively decide and

3774
03:07:21,711 --> 03:07:25,140
we should all collectively decide we 
should have ethics together.

3775
03:07:25,200 --> 03:07:26,970
Like whether it's right or left or in 
the middle,

3776
03:07:26,971 --> 03:07:27,721
we should all decide,
hey,

3777
03:07:27,721 --> 03:07:28,554
you can't do that because what you're 
doing is you're calling for violence 

3778
03:07:31,860 --> 03:07:33,560
against someone who's not committing any
violent.

3779
03:07:33,570 --> 03:07:34,403
Can I pause you right there because I 
think there's a really interesting 

3780
03:07:35,551 --> 03:07:36,384
point.

3781
03:07:38,150 --> 03:07:38,983
Let's assume that we know that that 
behavior needs to be downregulated in 

3782
03:07:42,361 --> 03:07:43,194
some way.
You can try to silence the person where 

3783
03:07:44,701 --> 03:07:47,460
we just physically duct tape them so 
they can't say anything,

3784
03:07:47,500 --> 03:07:48,460
right?
You know,

3785
03:07:48,540 --> 03:07:50,150
we put them in jail.
Uh,

3786
03:07:50,380 --> 03:07:52,370
we don't give them access to the media,
et Cetera,

3787
03:07:52,380 --> 03:07:53,890
et Cetera,
um,

3788
03:07:54,180 --> 03:07:55,013
or we can shame them or we can kind of 
take them aside at what layer of this 

3789
03:07:59,641 --> 03:08:02,490
sort of communication stack to very good
question.

3790
03:08:02,491 --> 03:08:03,324
We should.
Because I think one of the things that 

3791
03:08:04,921 --> 03:08:05,754
we haven't done this to positively say 
we agree with you that the speech is 

3792
03:08:09,931 --> 03:08:12,540
offensive and it is potentially 
dangerous,

3793
03:08:12,780 --> 03:08:13,613
but we think it should be downregulated 
differently than the D platforming 

3794
03:08:16,771 --> 03:08:18,240
option.
Well,

3795
03:08:18,390 --> 03:08:19,223
the D platforming option,
the real issue is there's only a few 

3796
03:08:23,550 --> 03:08:26,130
different avenues for these people to 
express themselves publicly.

3797
03:08:26,540 --> 03:08:27,480
Right?
And the,

3798
03:08:27,510 --> 03:08:32,130
the argument that's really strange is 
should these be regulated like a utility

3799
03:08:32,580 --> 03:08:36,250
or should they be thought of as private 
businesses get to decide what's on their

3800
03:08:36,510 --> 03:08:38,590
channel essentially,
like it's almost like a,

3801
03:08:38,591 --> 03:08:39,400
a,
a,

3802
03:08:39,400 --> 03:08:44,400
a private NBC that everyone can 
broadcast out if it's none of the above.

3803
03:08:44,820 --> 03:08:46,920
What if the problem is we're trying to 
pretend,

3804
03:08:47,010 --> 03:08:49,200
is it like a dinner party,
is that the public square?

3805
03:08:49,280 --> 03:08:51,330
Is that the utility?
And it's none of these things.

3806
03:08:52,080 --> 03:08:55,850
I think these ideas,
what I was discussing that like there's,

3807
03:08:55,960 --> 03:08:56,793
there's a reason why good ideas and bad 
ideas should go to war is the same 

3808
03:09:01,441 --> 03:09:02,274
reason why even though I kind of knew 
that most Kung Fu was bullshit before 

3809
03:09:06,841 --> 03:09:07,674
the UFC.
I want those guys to get in there and 

3810
03:09:09,331 --> 03:09:10,170
try,
oh,

3811
03:09:10,171 --> 03:09:12,480
you got some death touch.
Hey,

3812
03:09:12,870 --> 03:09:15,270
come on in.
I want to introduce you to a guy,

3813
03:09:15,440 --> 03:09:16,530
you know,
this is a,

3814
03:09:16,920 --> 03:09:17,753
his name's Cain Velasquez and you're 
going to try your death touch and now 

3815
03:09:20,730 --> 03:09:23,610
he's just going to wrestle to the ground
and beat your fucking brains in.

3816
03:09:23,640 --> 03:09:24,473
Okay.
But that's not going to happen because 

3817
03:09:25,501 --> 03:09:26,251
you know,
death touch,

3818
03:09:26,251 --> 03:09:28,910
but good luck and you let them duke it 
out and that is the,

3819
03:09:28,970 --> 03:09:31,560
that's what it is.
But it is a little.

3820
03:09:31,630 --> 03:09:31,801
No,
no,

3821
03:09:31,801 --> 03:09:32,634
no,
but,

3822
03:09:32,670 --> 03:09:35,400
but when you deep platform people,
that's when it's not angry with you.

3823
03:09:35,460 --> 03:09:38,320
But what I'm trying to get at is that it
is.

3824
03:09:38,880 --> 03:09:39,713
I hadn't really thought about it the 
extent to which Jordan is the only one 

3825
03:09:43,681 --> 03:09:46,680
of us that they've really gone after 
like this.

3826
03:09:47,490 --> 03:09:48,121
Well,
he's,

3827
03:09:48,121 --> 03:09:53,121
first of all,
he became famous from this,

3828
03:09:53,740 --> 03:09:54,250
right?

3829
03:09:54,250 --> 03:09:59,250
This is the battle was wha,
how he emerged.

3830
03:09:59,740 --> 03:10:04,740
He emerged from this battle over the use
of compelled pronouns for,

3831
03:10:05,740 --> 03:10:06,573
um,
various genders like the bread 78 

3832
03:10:09,910 --> 03:10:13,310
different genders.
Similar but not okay.

3833
03:10:13,630 --> 03:10:18,550
The difference is Brett's position.
He comes from a different place,

3834
03:10:18,880 --> 03:10:21,640
the way they were going at him with so 
much more than reasonable.

3835
03:10:22,420 --> 03:10:23,253
They were saying right away that what he
has to do is leave work because he's 

3836
03:10:28,691 --> 03:10:29,524
white.
They were basically saying a racist 

3837
03:10:31,931 --> 03:10:34,720
thing and everyone universally 
acknowledged as racist,

3838
03:10:34,810 --> 03:10:35,643
except for the super lefties who thought
that it made sense because in their 

3839
03:10:40,391 --> 03:10:43,330
mind,
every white person is somehow or another

3840
03:10:43,331 --> 03:10:44,164
guilty of at least at the very least 
using your privilege to advance in the 

3841
03:10:48,641 --> 03:10:50,340
world at the,
uh,

3842
03:10:51,030 --> 03:10:56,030
to the negative impact of people of 
color and people of other ethnicities.

3843
03:10:56,920 --> 03:10:57,753
So they decided that they are going to 
have a day of exclusion and instead of 

3844
03:11:00,671 --> 03:11:05,671
this day of absence having black people 
and people of color stay home,

3845
03:11:06,600 --> 03:11:07,990
they were going to kick white people 
out.

3846
03:11:07,990 --> 03:11:11,290
So it became an aggressive act instead 
of an act of appreciation,

3847
03:11:11,490 --> 03:11:12,240
it became,
uh,

3848
03:11:12,240 --> 03:11:16,900
an act of punishment or an act of 
exclusion and by people that are clearly

3849
03:11:16,901 --> 03:11:17,734
out of their fucking mind.
That was also part of the problem is 

3850
03:11:19,331 --> 03:11:20,920
their,
their arguments were incoherent.

3851
03:11:21,130 --> 03:11:21,963
You'd see that fucking stupid president 
of the university standing in front of 

3852
03:11:25,631 --> 03:11:26,464
those kids and they told him to put his 
hands down because he was threatening 

3853
03:11:29,380 --> 03:11:29,821
their,
you're,

3854
03:11:29,821 --> 03:11:32,230
you're scaring us.
You're making violent gestures with your

3855
03:11:32,231 --> 03:11:34,060
hands.
So he puts his hands down and they start

3856
03:11:34,061 --> 03:11:36,100
laughing.
This is nonsense.

3857
03:11:36,101 --> 03:11:36,934
Now you're in little kids.
You got little kids running lord of the 

3858
03:11:39,011 --> 03:11:42,160
flies on a grand scale in a state 
university.

3859
03:11:42,340 --> 03:11:43,270
And it's all.
I mean,

3860
03:11:43,300 --> 03:11:44,770
this is a public university,
right?

3861
03:11:44,840 --> 03:11:46,150
Yup.
I mean they get funding,

3862
03:11:46,180 --> 03:11:47,620
right?
This is all chaos.

3863
03:11:47,621 --> 03:11:49,540
Nobody agrees.
They got baseball bats.

3864
03:11:49,540 --> 03:11:51,700
They're looking for him.
If he's coming back to the school,

3865
03:11:51,790 --> 03:11:55,660
the kids form these vigilante groups 
with weapons over what?

3866
03:11:55,870 --> 03:11:58,090
Like who's threatening you?
Like what is happening?

3867
03:11:58,320 --> 03:11:59,153
You need weapons.
But the big story there was the non 

3868
03:12:01,151 --> 03:12:03,250
reporting.
What do you mean?

3869
03:12:03,251 --> 03:12:04,630
Well,
the New York Times,

3870
03:12:04,631 --> 03:12:07,300
Washington Post,
all of these major organs,

3871
03:12:07,301 --> 03:12:08,590
NPR,
they didn't report.

3872
03:12:08,650 --> 03:12:10,570
They didn't want to touch the story.
Well,

3873
03:12:10,571 --> 03:12:11,404
this is what this is.
My big theory here is that every outfit 

3874
03:12:15,851 --> 03:12:16,684
that has a a grand narrative cannot 
report the news that goes counter 

3875
03:12:20,951 --> 03:12:21,784
narrative,
so racism by blacks against whites 

3876
03:12:24,760 --> 03:12:25,593
cannot be reported by any outfit that 
believes that racism is impossible by 

3877
03:12:30,761 --> 03:12:34,120
blacks against whites,
that such a preposterous position.

3878
03:12:34,330 --> 03:12:37,060
The idea that racism is exclusive to any
group will,

3879
03:12:37,061 --> 03:12:40,570
but the redefinition of definition,
the redefinition could suck a fat dick.

3880
03:12:40,600 --> 03:12:42,520
It's a stupid redefinition.
That's true.

3881
03:12:42,760 --> 03:12:43,593
This idea that the only way you can be 
racist as if you have power over that 

3882
03:12:46,901 --> 03:12:48,160
other group.
That's nonsense.

3883
03:12:48,161 --> 03:12:48,994
Every human beings act as individuals 
and they always have power over each 

3884
03:12:51,321 --> 03:12:51,980
other.
You have

3885
03:12:51,980 --> 03:12:54,620
power to intimidate,
you have power to isolate.

3886
03:12:54,621 --> 03:12:57,890
You have power.
If there's more using about this is that

3887
03:12:59,090 --> 03:13:01,580
there is no pretense of consistency.
I mean,

3888
03:13:01,640 --> 03:13:02,473
on that side of the aisle,
it's like we're going to throw out the 

3889
03:13:06,171 --> 03:13:10,250
following 17 completely contradictory 
rules and then we'll tell you which rule

3890
03:13:10,251 --> 03:13:12,050
is operative in any given moment.
So,

3891
03:13:12,530 --> 03:13:14,540
you know,
I was going to throw out this concept of

3892
03:13:14,541 --> 03:13:17,840
the Hilbert problems for social justice.
So one of them is,

3893
03:13:18,350 --> 03:13:19,183
um,
you cannot understand me because my 

3894
03:13:21,411 --> 03:13:22,244
experience is too different and you must
understand me because mine is so 

3895
03:13:24,981 --> 03:13:26,320
important,
right?

3896
03:13:26,360 --> 03:13:27,370
Or,
um,

3897
03:13:27,490 --> 03:13:32,490
we're all similar enough that any 
deviation from 50 slash 50 shows you the

3898
03:13:32,961 --> 03:13:33,794
amount of sexism in a workforce and we 
are all so different that once you 

3899
03:13:37,191 --> 03:13:38,630
include women,
uh,

3900
03:13:38,631 --> 03:13:39,464
in previously male occupations,
you will see a great benefit because of 

3901
03:13:43,011 --> 03:13:43,970
the diversity of opinion.

3902
03:13:44,110 --> 03:13:48,560
Once he saw all these self-contradictory
couplets that you have to agree to.

3903
03:13:49,040 --> 03:13:49,873
Well,
that's the weird thing is who assumed 

3904
03:13:53,261 --> 03:13:54,094
that I just buy all of your stuff.
I think we've made a terrible tactical 

3905
03:13:56,511 --> 03:13:57,344
error.
We fought these bad ideas rather than 

3906
03:13:59,631 --> 03:14:04,631
saying maybe we should just accept all 
of your bad ideas and then show you what

3907
03:14:04,971 --> 03:14:07,930
kind of a weird world.
Yes.

3908
03:14:07,931 --> 03:14:08,970
No,
no,

3909
03:14:08,980 --> 03:14:09,261
no,
no.

3910
03:14:09,261 --> 03:14:11,690
You can't do that because they don't 
make sense.

3911
03:14:11,930 --> 03:14:12,830
You can't say,
oh yeah,

3912
03:14:12,831 --> 03:14:13,780
they make sense.
Men,

3913
03:14:13,790 --> 03:14:15,200
how do I know when you're serious?
Well,

3914
03:14:15,201 --> 03:14:16,034
but that's my.
Just let those through and does things 

3915
03:14:17,091 --> 03:14:17,924
fail.
But that's my point is that by showing 

3916
03:14:20,931 --> 03:14:23,570
the internal,
this is in mathematics.

3917
03:14:23,571 --> 03:14:24,404
We call this reductio ad absurdum that 
once you take on too many different 

3918
03:14:27,321 --> 03:14:28,154
points,
you show the conflicts showing that 

3919
03:14:30,560 --> 03:14:31,393
those things can't all be true.
There's no way in which if I accept all 

3920
03:14:35,121 --> 03:14:38,000
of your ideas,
I can run anything.

3921
03:14:38,000 --> 03:14:38,331
So,
you know,

3922
03:14:38,331 --> 03:14:41,750
take this thing about a trans exclusion 
from Victoria secret,

3923
03:14:42,770 --> 03:14:44,300
right?
You didn't hear about this.

3924
03:14:44,690 --> 03:14:45,523
Oh God.
So the idea is that the Victoria secret 

3925
03:14:48,411 --> 03:14:51,920
lingerie division head had to step down,
um,

3926
03:14:52,280 --> 03:14:53,113
where there was a scandal in the 
background that somebody had said we 

3927
03:14:55,431 --> 03:14:59,990
don't actually want a trans people 
walking the Victoria secret runway.

3928
03:15:01,220 --> 03:15:03,350
Right?
And so very interesting.

3929
03:15:03,351 --> 03:15:08,351
You have a company that is dedicated to 
the commercial exploitation of humans as

3930
03:15:09,111 --> 03:15:11,750
sexual objects for the privilege of the 
male gaze.

3931
03:15:12,470 --> 03:15:16,820
And now you're angry that it doesn't 
include trans into that exploited class.

3932
03:15:18,110 --> 03:15:18,943
So just without,
without getting into whether this makes 

3933
03:15:21,500 --> 03:15:22,333
good economic sense or anything,
there's just the issue of self 

3934
03:15:24,471 --> 03:15:25,304
contradiction,
but isn't that a reductionist view of 

3935
03:15:27,081 --> 03:15:27,914
what Victoria secrets is?
Isn't it possible that a woman can feel 

3936
03:15:30,591 --> 03:15:31,424
empowered and sexy if she's wearing 
lingerie and it's not just to the 

3937
03:15:33,801 --> 03:15:38,801
exploiting of the male gaze that they,
that she appreciates looking attractive.

3938
03:15:39,050 --> 03:15:40,230
Wonderful.
So take that off.

3939
03:15:40,231 --> 03:15:40,791
Okay.
Right.

3940
03:15:40,791 --> 03:15:43,130
Exactly.
So the idea is that you're both going to

3941
03:15:43,131 --> 03:15:43,964
say I'm a,
that that's a positive female 

3942
03:15:49,200 --> 03:15:50,033
empowerment issue and it's a terrible 
male expectation as you at the same 

3943
03:15:53,101 --> 03:15:55,280
time,
terrible male exploitation issue.

3944
03:15:55,300 --> 03:15:58,950
Like what if a guy likes what if women 
decide universally,

3945
03:15:58,951 --> 03:15:59,784
they like guys who wear leopard skin 
underwear and guidestar wearing leopard 

3946
03:16:02,401 --> 03:16:05,260
skin tidy whitey underwear.
Well this is sexual selection but,

3947
03:16:05,310 --> 03:16:06,360
but yes,
but,

3948
03:16:06,361 --> 03:16:08,850
but it's the difference between that and
women wearing lingerie.

3949
03:16:08,880 --> 03:16:09,713
If women wear lingerie and they do it 
because they like to be an interesting 

3950
03:16:13,171 --> 03:16:14,004
stat and they liked to be more try,
that's what they're to accentuate their 

3951
03:16:16,321 --> 03:16:17,154
attracts.
So then the sexual self objectification 

3952
03:16:19,021 --> 03:16:21,690
is an interesting issue.
Is that an issue of empowerment or is an

3953
03:16:21,691 --> 03:16:23,730
issue of oppression?
It could certainly be.

3954
03:16:23,760 --> 03:16:24,593
Well,
that's what if a woman's health to take 

3955
03:16:25,261 --> 03:16:26,160
that,
take that all on.

3956
03:16:26,190 --> 03:16:27,650
Why does it have to be exploitation 
though?

3957
03:16:27,850 --> 03:16:28,683
That's the question,
but what I'm trying to say is you've t 

3958
03:16:30,780 --> 03:16:32,850
some point.
You've made too many arguments.

3959
03:16:32,851 --> 03:16:36,330
There's this concept called the 
principle of explosion in mathematics.

3960
03:16:36,720 --> 03:16:37,553
The principle of explosion says if you 
can get one contradiction through 

3961
03:16:40,021 --> 03:16:40,854
airport security,
you can blow up the universe as soon as 

3962
03:16:43,531 --> 03:16:46,200
you allow a single contradiction in the 
unity of knowledge,

3963
03:16:46,560 --> 03:16:49,680
everything can be proven right,
so everything becomes meaningless.

3964
03:16:50,220 --> 03:16:54,210
So the game in some sense in mathematics
is frequently to say,

3965
03:16:54,211 --> 03:16:56,160
well,
let's take all of those beautiful things

3966
03:16:56,161 --> 03:16:59,310
that you believe.
So you've just created some done seated.

3967
03:16:59,330 --> 03:17:00,163
Some throw them all in.
Instead of saying what's true and what 

3968
03:17:02,581 --> 03:17:04,500
isn't true,
you say,

3969
03:17:04,530 --> 03:17:05,363
are these compatible?
And these ideas are clearly 

3970
03:17:07,861 --> 03:17:09,840
incompatible.
So for example,

3971
03:17:09,930 --> 03:17:10,763
one of the tricks that I use is to look 
at advertising for women to women and 

3972
03:17:18,211 --> 03:17:19,530
what phrases get used.

3973
03:17:19,560 --> 03:17:20,393
So if you used the phrase turn heads the
summer in quotes and put it into a 

3974
03:17:23,311 --> 03:17:24,144
search engine,
you'll find all sorts of revealing 

3975
03:17:27,151 --> 03:17:29,730
outfits that are intended to court the 
male gaze.

3976
03:17:30,450 --> 03:17:31,283
You say,
well maybe that's not really the male 

3977
03:17:32,161 --> 03:17:32,994
gaze.
So then you put in a phrase like make 

3978
03:17:33,811 --> 03:17:37,560
him drool and that will be used to 
market to women.

3979
03:17:38,460 --> 03:17:43,460
And so this issue about can we at least 
get to a point where we're talking about

3980
03:17:44,131 --> 03:17:46,560
the internal contradictions of your 
position?

3981
03:17:46,590 --> 03:17:47,423
Like I,
I don't even want to get into what my 

3982
03:17:48,601 --> 03:17:49,434
position is.
The first thing that's scaring me is 

3983
03:17:51,691 --> 03:17:54,960
that you've said so many things so 
strongly and so dogmatically,

3984
03:17:54,961 --> 03:17:56,670
and this doesn't have to be about 
gender.

3985
03:17:56,671 --> 03:17:58,590
It could be about race,
it could be about class,

3986
03:17:59,400 --> 03:18:01,890
but when once you've said too many 
things,

3987
03:18:02,490 --> 03:18:03,450
then I can say,
look,

3988
03:18:03,780 --> 03:18:08,610
I don't see any way of squaring all of 
your positions and it's not.

3989
03:18:08,610 --> 03:18:09,443
It doesn't even have to do with me.
I think that's where we haven't gone to 

3990
03:18:13,111 --> 03:18:13,944
yet.
So you think letting them come up with 

3991
03:18:15,691 --> 03:18:16,524
as many preposterous things as possible.
And then once it gets to a position 

3992
03:18:20,191 --> 03:18:21,120
where they,
the,

3993
03:18:21,230 --> 03:18:23,850
the idea's contradicted each other,
expose that.

3994
03:18:23,880 --> 03:18:24,780
Well,
that's my point,

3995
03:18:24,781 --> 03:18:27,320
which is once you've told me all of your
principals,

3996
03:18:28,470 --> 03:18:29,880
then I'm going to say,
great,

3997
03:18:30,600 --> 03:18:31,433
I'm confused.
Do you feel that I have to understand 

3998
03:18:33,601 --> 03:18:34,434
you or that I can't understand you 
because I don't know which is operative 

3999
03:18:38,071 --> 03:18:38,904
in this situation.
Tell me the rule how I decide which 

4000
03:18:41,521 --> 03:18:44,940
principle that you've stated governed 
this situation.

4001
03:18:45,850 --> 03:18:47,020
Right?
So if.

4002
03:18:47,530 --> 03:18:48,280
Go ahead.
One

4003
03:18:48,280 --> 03:18:49,113
last point about that.
I don't want to have to refer to you 

4004
03:18:53,350 --> 03:18:54,100
where you say,
well,

4005
03:18:54,100 --> 03:18:54,933
you bring,
you bring me each individual situation 

4006
03:18:56,560 --> 03:18:57,393
and I will tell you which principals 
operative in which principals 

4007
03:19:00,490 --> 03:19:04,540
inoperative that doesn't work.
I want you to list your principles,

4008
03:19:04,630 --> 03:19:08,470
enlist your mechanisms for resolving the
conflicts within your principles.

4009
03:19:08,950 --> 03:19:09,783
And then once you've done that,
we can actually evaluate what you're 

4010
03:19:12,881 --> 03:19:13,714
saying.
But at the moment it requires you as an 

4011
03:19:15,610 --> 03:19:16,443
oracle to tell me which of your many 
contradict your seemingly contradictory 

4012
03:19:20,081 --> 03:19:23,500
positions is operative in every 
particular case.

4013
03:19:23,710 --> 03:19:24,543
So for example,
we did that one with the person who was 

4014
03:19:27,581 --> 03:19:29,410
the quantum,
uh,

4015
03:19:29,970 --> 03:19:31,510
ex Muslim,
trans,

4016
03:19:31,511 --> 03:19:32,260
trans,
you know,

4017
03:19:32,260 --> 03:19:34,810
everything going on,
which is operative,

4018
03:19:34,840 --> 03:19:35,673
the person with mckayla phobia,
which is a extremely rare psychological 

4019
03:19:39,310 --> 03:19:40,143
condition,
or the person who appears to be a deep 

4020
03:19:44,081 --> 03:19:45,880
into some self,
uh,

4021
03:19:46,440 --> 03:19:47,273
you know,
some radical self actualization 

4022
03:19:49,331 --> 03:19:53,680
principal or even a person who wears 
that crazy makeup should be able to wear

4023
03:19:53,681 --> 03:19:54,330
whatever they want.

4024
03:19:54,330 --> 03:19:55,163
It's nothing wrong with it.
You should be able to dress like Paul 

4025
03:19:56,500 --> 03:19:57,370
Stanley from kiss,
if that's your,

4026
03:19:57,490 --> 03:19:59,230
to assume that that's true.
But what if,

4027
03:19:59,231 --> 03:20:01,120
for example,
as a heterosexual male,

4028
03:20:01,121 --> 03:20:03,620
you don't want to watch,
um,

4029
03:20:04,560 --> 03:20:05,393
uh,
the crying game at the Victoria secret 

4030
03:20:07,720 --> 03:20:09,790
runway show.
Do you think that,

4031
03:20:09,791 --> 03:20:11,710
wait a minute,
do you really think that Victoria secret

4032
03:20:11,770 --> 03:20:15,460
runway shows for the heterosexual male 
in some sense?

4033
03:20:15,461 --> 03:20:17,490
Yes.
What guys,

4034
03:20:17,840 --> 03:20:21,690
has he ever watched a Victoria secrets?
That's what the guy said.

4035
03:20:21,691 --> 03:20:24,700
He said it was a,
he's branding it as.

4036
03:20:25,580 --> 03:20:25,811
No,
no,

4037
03:20:25,811 --> 03:20:26,590
no.
I mean,

4038
03:20:26,590 --> 03:20:30,250
there's something between a fantasy of 
Victoria secrets.

4039
03:20:30,270 --> 03:20:35,270
A senior executive recently told that 
trans models don't belong in the fantasy

4040
03:20:35,920 --> 03:20:38,560
of Victoria secret's fashion show.
Well,

4041
03:20:39,100 --> 03:20:39,933
you know,
that's,

4042
03:20:40,100 --> 03:20:41,940
that's on him,
you know,

4043
03:20:41,970 --> 03:20:44,530
I mean he wants to be the.
But just because he said it doesn't mean

4044
03:20:44,531 --> 03:20:45,160
it's true.

4045
03:20:45,160 --> 03:20:45,993
I guess if you looked at the graph of 
male to female viewers have a Victoria 

4046
03:20:49,511 --> 03:20:50,650
secrets.
I have no idea.

4047
03:20:50,800 --> 03:20:55,120
It would be like a few prepubescent boys
and the vast majority of women and maybe

4048
03:20:55,121 --> 03:20:56,740
some gay guys,
but that's it.

4049
03:20:56,770 --> 03:20:57,603
Is that right?
It's got to be without fuck is sitting 

4050
03:21:00,161 --> 03:21:02,590
around with on honor an hour.
What are you doing?

4051
03:21:02,800 --> 03:21:03,251
Oh,
again,

4052
03:21:03,251 --> 03:21:05,710
some popcorn ready for the Victoria's 
secret fashion show.

4053
03:21:05,830 --> 03:21:06,663
Dogs coming over and Mike and we're 
going to drill to TV thought fuck Outta 

4054
03:21:09,191 --> 03:21:11,950
here is porn and then there's everything
else.

4055
03:21:12,250 --> 03:21:14,380
Everything else is for chicks.
Okay.

4056
03:21:14,880 --> 03:21:15,713
Runway Shit.
I don't know the single guy out there 

4057
03:21:17,561 --> 03:21:19,540
watching runway shit.
It's like,

4058
03:21:19,570 --> 03:21:24,570
remember when playboy had play girl?
That was her gay gay dudes.

4059
03:21:24,770 --> 03:21:26,160
Not for chicks.
Right?

4060
03:21:26,380 --> 03:21:29,350
They don't want to see that and we don't
want to see runways.

4061
03:21:29,590 --> 03:21:29,920
We're not.

4062
03:21:29,920 --> 03:21:30,753
We're not here for runways.
We get bored easy bunch of chicks 

4063
03:21:33,641 --> 03:21:37,540
walking around in their underwear.
I think you're calling it very.

4064
03:21:37,600 --> 03:21:39,940
You may be right about who the audience 
is.

4065
03:21:39,941 --> 03:21:40,774
I have no idea on the demographics.
I've never watched one of these in my 

4066
03:21:42,611 --> 03:21:43,444
life,
but it's not the case that I believe 

4067
03:21:45,621 --> 03:21:46,454
that male,
the male gaze is nowhere to be found 

4068
03:21:48,231 --> 03:21:49,064
here because it's a very weird thing 
that the female is largely buying a an 

4069
03:21:54,561 --> 03:21:57,920
amplifier for something that is supposed
to excite a male,

4070
03:21:57,921 --> 03:21:58,754
but it's.
It's a little bit to me like the female 

4071
03:22:01,491 --> 03:22:06,020
is the magician buying magic supplies at
a store for the audience.

4072
03:22:06,380 --> 03:22:07,520
Right?
Sure,

4073
03:22:07,550 --> 03:22:08,960
sure.
That's a good way of looking at it.

4074
03:22:09,290 --> 03:22:11,630
I don't think there's.
The male gaze is absent.

4075
03:22:11,870 --> 03:22:13,880
I just don't buy his interpretation at 
that.

4076
03:22:13,881 --> 03:22:14,714
It's a fantasy for men.
It's ruined with Trans men or trans 

4077
03:22:17,091 --> 03:22:17,360
women.

4078
03:22:17,360 --> 03:22:18,193
I don't.
I don't have.

4079
03:22:18,600 --> 03:22:20,680
I don't have a dog in that fight.
Seems silly.

4080
03:22:21,040 --> 03:22:21,873
It seems silly.
It's like if you don't want transgender 

4081
03:22:23,181 --> 03:22:26,120
people to be in there,
you just have to say you can't say.

4082
03:22:26,121 --> 03:22:28,220
It ruins the fantasy.
He just say,

4083
03:22:28,240 --> 03:22:30,500
I will only hiring people that have 
vaginas,

4084
03:22:30,890 --> 03:22:32,150
I don't know,
do whatever you want.

4085
03:22:32,350 --> 03:22:33,183
Like you can.
Like there's certain jobs if you go to 

4086
03:22:34,881 --> 03:22:37,430
Chippendale's,
like our trans women shown up,

4087
03:22:37,730 --> 03:22:38,563
trans men,
are they at chippendales where they're 

4088
03:22:41,320 --> 03:22:44,600
down there because they don't have a 
dick and but they're all jacked and they

4089
03:22:44,601 --> 03:22:45,434
looked like a man is just what women 
want to see and are they transphobic if 

4090
03:22:47,841 --> 03:22:50,510
they don't want to see that.
If women go to a,

4091
03:22:50,560 --> 03:22:51,393
you know,
one of those all mail review shows and 

4092
03:22:53,181 --> 03:22:56,360
it's all trans men,
but they're heterosexual and they're not

4093
03:22:56,361 --> 03:22:57,290
really into trans man.

4094
03:22:57,290 --> 03:23:00,100
Are they all phobic?
Yeah.

4095
03:23:00,110 --> 03:23:02,990
So what I'm trying to get at is there's 
a hierarchy,

4096
03:23:03,010 --> 03:23:03,843
like I'm not that interested in this,
in the particulars of Victoria's 

4097
03:23:06,941 --> 03:23:10,010
secret's profitability and what their 
statements are.

4098
03:23:10,300 --> 03:23:13,380
What I'm more interested in is you've 
cut,

4099
03:23:13,430 --> 03:23:14,263
you've annunciated so many.
There's so many different principles at 

4100
03:23:17,931 --> 03:23:22,931
work as to what should govern in a 
conflict that you won't tell me.

4101
03:23:23,750 --> 03:23:24,381
Well,
okay.

4102
03:23:24,381 --> 03:23:25,214
When these two things,
these two beautiful things that you've 

4103
03:23:26,661 --> 03:23:27,494
said actually lie in conflict,
how do you resolve the conflicts and it 

4104
03:23:30,891 --> 03:23:31,790
seems to be,
well,

4105
03:23:31,850 --> 03:23:32,683
why don't you consult us on every single
one of these and we'll tell you a case 

4106
03:23:36,891 --> 03:23:37,724
by case and that can't work because what
I want to know is I don't want to 

4107
03:23:41,121 --> 03:23:41,954
appoint you as an oracle.
I want you to state what your positions 

4108
03:23:44,691 --> 03:23:45,524
are.
I want you to state how you harmonize 

4109
03:23:46,671 --> 03:23:49,220
them and then we're having a 
conversation,

4110
03:23:49,221 --> 03:23:50,054
but as long as I have to keep going to 
you and your crazy definitions and 

4111
03:23:53,541 --> 03:23:55,070
you're well,
this is operative on,

4112
03:23:55,120 --> 03:23:57,170
on Alternate Tuesdays,
then it doesn't work.

4113
03:23:57,170 --> 03:23:59,180
I completely see your point.
However,

4114
03:23:59,300 --> 03:24:02,780
you can't give ground.
You can't give grounded nonsense because

4115
03:24:02,781 --> 03:24:05,270
that ground was never get back.
You never getting it back.

4116
03:24:05,540 --> 03:24:08,660
If you allow them to establish certain 
ridiculous principles,

4117
03:24:08,661 --> 03:24:10,310
rules that are contradictory to each 
other,

4118
03:24:10,311 --> 03:24:12,140
they'll come up with a reason why they 
make sense.

4119
03:24:12,141 --> 03:24:12,311
No,
no,

4120
03:24:12,311 --> 03:24:13,144
no.
You don't allow them to put it into the 

4121
03:24:14,301 --> 03:24:15,290
workforce.
You say,

4122
03:24:15,291 --> 03:24:17,330
look,
before we put it into the workforce,

4123
03:24:17,750 --> 03:24:21,350
let's just understand the 17 different 
things that you've said.

4124
03:24:21,351 --> 03:24:22,820
Are absolutes.
Well,

4125
03:24:22,821 --> 03:24:23,654
you're basically doing then what Jordan 
does and every single one of these 

4126
03:24:25,881 --> 03:24:26,714
debates,
you letting people lay out their idea 

4127
03:24:28,851 --> 03:24:31,010
and then you shoot them down and you 
decide what's.

4128
03:24:31,060 --> 03:24:34,280
What's logical and what's illogical.
I think that's.

4129
03:24:34,460 --> 03:24:39,080
That's the UFC of ideas and this is why 
it's important to let these shitty ideas

4130
03:24:39,081 --> 03:24:39,914
into the match.
Why do we still have so much caught up 

4131
03:24:43,200 --> 03:24:44,730
in the Akita League

4132
03:24:44,820 --> 03:24:45,653
in the country?

4133
03:24:46,050 --> 03:24:46,883
Because it sounds good.
People liked the idea that you don't 

4134
03:24:48,541 --> 03:24:49,374
have to learn much.
You could just go in there with a death 

4135
03:24:50,461 --> 03:24:51,510
touch.
Fuck people up.

4136
03:24:51,930 --> 03:24:54,750
They don't want to think that all you 
have to practice for 10,000

4137
03:24:54,751 --> 03:24:55,584
hours.
You have to sprawl and work on your leg 

4138
03:24:57,421 --> 03:25:01,560
kicks and working with this public 
shaming is death touch well,

4139
03:25:01,590 --> 03:25:04,500
debating these.
I think honestly,

4140
03:25:04,501 --> 03:25:07,470
and I'm not trying to blow Air Jordan's 
horn anymore than I already have,

4141
03:25:07,710 --> 03:25:08,543
but I think what he does is very 
important because he is one of the few 

4142
03:25:12,570 --> 03:25:15,900
that engages in these people,
in these very public forums,

4143
03:25:16,170 --> 03:25:17,003
in these long form debates where they go
to war with ideas and these are way 

4144
03:25:21,211 --> 03:25:24,510
better their conversations because 
because he's fucking good at it,

4145
03:25:24,790 --> 03:25:28,260
they want to chop them to not picking 
you so much because I'm friendly.

4146
03:25:28,590 --> 03:25:32,320
I'm not as like,
I'm not as combative as he is,

4147
03:25:32,321 --> 03:25:35,190
so I send them also not as smart as he 
is and I'm also not as.

4148
03:25:35,250 --> 03:25:36,880
I'm not,
I don't have credentials.

4149
03:25:37,150 --> 03:25:38,910
I don't have the credentials that he 
has.

4150
03:25:39,100 --> 03:25:41,520
Like when he is the University of 
Toronto professor,

4151
03:25:41,530 --> 03:25:42,363
a Phd,
when he's going to war with these 

4152
03:25:44,101 --> 03:25:45,040
people,
they're,

4153
03:25:45,041 --> 03:25:48,540
they're throwing out valiant warriors to
die at his sword.

4154
03:25:48,541 --> 03:25:50,230
What did you hear?
What to watch?

4155
03:25:50,380 --> 03:25:52,820
Bread and Richard Dawkins.
Cargo.

4156
03:25:52,950 --> 03:25:54,970
So what happened?
They appeared on the stage for the first

4157
03:25:54,971 --> 03:25:56,890
time.
They oppose each other.

4158
03:25:56,920 --> 03:25:57,880
Oh yeah.
Really?

4159
03:25:57,881 --> 03:26:00,010
On religion.
Oh,

4160
03:26:00,011 --> 03:26:01,330
well,
it's Dawkins now.

4161
03:26:01,331 --> 03:26:02,280
Religious?
No,

4162
03:26:02,281 --> 03:26:02,461
no,
no.

4163
03:26:02,461 --> 03:26:05,590
Dawkins is staunchly in that a sort of 
new atheists,

4164
03:26:06,070 --> 03:26:08,620
aggressive guys.
I panic because I know you had a stroke.

4165
03:26:08,820 --> 03:26:09,920
Oh,
okay guys.

4166
03:26:10,010 --> 03:26:12,520
You know what I'm saying?
I thought your brother was an atheist as

4167
03:26:12,521 --> 03:26:15,970
well,
but Brett doesn't think that religion is

4168
03:26:15,971 --> 03:26:17,930
a virus.
It's not Paris.

4169
03:26:18,730 --> 03:26:23,730
He believes that religion is actually an
adaptation and the weird thing was is he

4170
03:26:23,771 --> 03:26:24,604
said,
look,

4171
03:26:25,000 --> 03:26:25,833
there's young Dawkins and there's old 
dock and young Dawkins came up with 

4172
03:26:28,481 --> 03:26:31,120
these two powerful ideas.
The idea that the meme,

4173
03:26:31,121 --> 03:26:36,121
the unit of ideation a is a,
is a gene like object.

4174
03:26:39,100 --> 03:26:42,070
He also came up with the idea of the 
extended phenotype.

4175
03:26:42,071 --> 03:26:45,430
So when you talked about that ant mound 
that you were excavating,

4176
03:26:45,850 --> 03:26:50,680
that ant mound is in some sense part of 
the and strategy.

4177
03:26:50,680 --> 03:26:51,513
It's such a.
it's so deeply tied in that you have to 

4178
03:26:54,971 --> 03:26:55,804
consider the ant mound is part of the 
ant system because it can't exist 

4179
03:26:59,051 --> 03:27:01,090
without that complicated underground 
city.

4180
03:27:01,520 --> 03:27:02,110
Right?
Right.

4181
03:27:02,110 --> 03:27:03,820
And so what he said was,
okay,

4182
03:27:03,821 --> 03:27:04,654
if I use these two concepts,
that memes are like genes and the genes 

4183
03:27:10,601 --> 03:27:13,840
can throw off a bad meme instantly.
So genes,

4184
03:27:13,900 --> 03:27:18,310
memes have to ride on a gene and they 
can't parasitize it too much,

4185
03:27:18,730 --> 03:27:21,160
and you also have this inclusive 
fitness,

4186
03:27:21,161 --> 03:27:21,994
which is,
that may be religions co travel with us 

4187
03:27:23,711 --> 03:27:24,544
and allow us to outcompete those who 
don't have them because they seem to be 

4188
03:27:28,120 --> 03:27:28,953
found everywhere.

4189
03:27:29,080 --> 03:27:30,040
So prevalent.
Right?

4190
03:27:30,070 --> 03:27:32,050
You have to,
if you looked at it objectively,

4191
03:27:32,260 --> 03:27:33,093
not looked at it in terms of you know,
how you feel about cult like behavior 

4192
03:27:38,111 --> 03:27:41,530
and people's susceptibility to 
influence.

4193
03:27:41,560 --> 03:27:42,100
If you just looked

4194
03:27:42,100 --> 03:27:42,933
at it objectively,
if you were from another dementia and 

4195
03:27:44,131 --> 03:27:44,561
you'd go,
well,

4196
03:27:44,561 --> 03:27:46,840
clearly this is a part of being a 
successful person.

4197
03:27:46,841 --> 03:27:47,860
Tell me about it.
Exactly.

4198
03:27:47,890 --> 03:27:50,080
So Brett,
Brett and Dawkins met,

4199
03:27:50,710 --> 03:27:53,380
and I think Dawkins had this kind of 
reaction like,

4200
03:27:53,470 --> 03:27:54,303
Oh crap,
I'm meeting an ultra Darwinist who's 

4201
03:27:58,211 --> 03:27:59,044
read my work,
taking it seriously and is feeding it 

4202
03:28:02,201 --> 03:28:04,060
back in and saying,
you,

4203
03:28:04,120 --> 03:28:05,320
you,
Richard Dawkins,

4204
03:28:05,321 --> 03:28:08,260
in your younger years,
established ideas.

4205
03:28:08,680 --> 03:28:09,880
Who,
when that,

4206
03:28:09,920 --> 03:28:12,880
when those ideas,
logical consequences or explored,

4207
03:28:13,360 --> 03:28:14,193
it completely negates your late life 
hatred for religion because it reveals 

4208
03:28:18,911 --> 03:28:19,744
it to be an adaptation rather than a 
pair of citizen action of the human 

4209
03:28:22,091 --> 03:28:23,550
species.
You know what?

4210
03:28:23,551 --> 03:28:27,610
The real problem that I've always had 
with Dawkins and his take on religion is

4211
03:28:27,611 --> 03:28:28,444
not that he's wrong or they're right,
it's his anger that he has when he's 

4212
03:28:32,801 --> 03:28:35,020
talking to people that believe,
yeah,

4213
03:28:35,040 --> 03:28:35,600
he,
he,

4214
03:28:35,600 --> 03:28:36,433
he sets,
he sets up the kind of like heavy 

4215
03:28:39,221 --> 03:28:41,650
conflict that,
you know,

4216
03:28:41,770 --> 03:28:45,010
the way people interact with each other,
right is very.

4217
03:28:45,100 --> 03:28:49,750
The reactions are very dependent upon 
the attitude that a person has when they

4218
03:28:49,751 --> 03:28:51,790
go into this interaction,
you know,

4219
03:28:51,800 --> 03:28:54,100
with two people meet on the street,
one person,

4220
03:28:54,620 --> 03:28:58,840
the one person meets that person says 
the same words and they wind up hugging.

4221
03:28:58,900 --> 03:29:01,450
Another person meets that person and has
a fistfight.

4222
03:29:01,900 --> 03:29:02,920
Like what?
What is,

4223
03:29:02,980 --> 03:29:03,940
what's the difference?
Well,

4224
03:29:03,941 --> 03:29:04,774
there's a lot of it is the way you 
approach people a lot of is the way you 

4225
03:29:07,660 --> 03:29:10,930
accept people's ideas,
the way you communicate with them,

4226
03:29:10,931 --> 03:29:13,780
the way you allow them to fully express 
themselves without judgment.

4227
03:29:14,020 --> 03:29:15,940
And he doesn't,
he doesn't buy any of that.

4228
03:29:15,941 --> 03:29:16,774
He feels like there's a war going on and
he's got to shut down religion as 

4229
03:29:19,661 --> 03:29:21,550
quickly as possible.
That's the thing he wanted to.

4230
03:29:24,520 --> 03:29:25,353
He wanted to fashion a science into a 
cudgel that was maximally efficient for 

4231
03:29:31,300 --> 03:29:33,660
beating the crap out of religion.
That's a great way to put it.

4232
03:29:33,661 --> 03:29:34,494
And what Brett did is to say,
actually your scientific work goes in 

4233
03:29:38,021 --> 03:29:38,854
the exact opposite direction.
The reason I brought it up was it was 

4234
03:29:41,711 --> 03:29:46,300
one of these unexpected occurrences that
when you have a meeting of these things,

4235
03:29:46,301 --> 03:29:47,134
and this is your point about the UFC,
is that the mixed martial arts thing 

4236
03:29:49,861 --> 03:29:50,111
was,
hey,

4237
03:29:50,111 --> 03:29:51,970
we don't know what's going to work.
We don't know what's going to have.

4238
03:29:52,150 --> 03:29:57,010
Nobody knows anything yet.
And gradually we came to understand that

4239
03:29:57,011 --> 03:29:57,844
there were certain systems that were 
hyper effective and that even those 

4240
03:30:00,131 --> 03:30:01,260
could get,
um,

4241
03:30:01,680 --> 03:30:02,513
you know,
you were making the point earlier about 

4242
03:30:03,250 --> 03:30:07,570
Brazilian Jujitsu didn't keep advancing,
uh,

4243
03:30:07,571 --> 03:30:08,404
at the same level once we understood the
role of all of these different systems 

4244
03:30:11,861 --> 03:30:12,910
and advancing fighting.

4245
03:30:13,300 --> 03:30:14,133
So the question that I'm having 
repeatedly is what kept Brett and 

4246
03:30:17,291 --> 03:30:18,910
Dawkins,
for example,

4247
03:30:18,940 --> 03:30:21,910
from having that meeting,
um,

4248
03:30:22,450 --> 03:30:23,283
where I think dawkins probably didn't 
fully understand what he was getting 

4249
03:30:25,811 --> 03:30:29,500
into when he agreed to appear within 
evolutionary theorist on stage.

4250
03:30:30,130 --> 03:30:30,963
But you don't,
you think that he's just very confident 

4251
03:30:31,991 --> 03:30:33,850
in his ideas.
He's very confident,

4252
03:30:33,851 --> 03:30:34,684
his intellectual capabilities,
he's been doing these types of debates 

4253
03:30:37,031 --> 03:30:41,960
and shutting down these secular or these
people that are from various religions.

4254
03:30:41,961 --> 03:30:42,441
Right.
I mean,

4255
03:30:42,441 --> 03:30:43,300
from,
he's,

4256
03:30:43,450 --> 03:30:46,220
he's had these debates with people from 
Judaism,

4257
03:30:46,221 --> 03:30:49,130
from Christianity.
He has been as part of his career.

4258
03:30:49,250 --> 03:30:49,870
Right?
Yeah.

4259
03:30:49,870 --> 03:30:52,670
I mean,
and even what the fuck's his name?

4260
03:30:52,860 --> 03:30:55,730
Uh,
the Indian fellow who,

4261
03:30:55,731 --> 03:30:58,070
uh,
everybody makes fun of,

4262
03:30:58,850 --> 03:31:00,680
what the Fuck's his name?
Dinesh D'souza?

4263
03:31:00,710 --> 03:31:01,543
No,
the other guy,

4264
03:31:02,000 --> 03:31:02,833
the one,
the,

4265
03:31:02,920 --> 03:31:05,840
the quantum guy.
That's always using that guy,

4266
03:31:06,620 --> 03:31:07,453
that guy,
that guy is constantly using 

4267
03:31:09,680 --> 03:31:10,513
inappropriate quantum words,
throws quantum into fucking vegetable 

4268
03:31:14,181 --> 03:31:16,220
soup and tries to make it to make sense.

4269
03:31:16,410 --> 03:31:18,350
He,
he used a lot of word salad,

4270
03:31:18,670 --> 03:31:20,200
you know,
and um,

4271
03:31:20,630 --> 03:31:22,110
I mean,
I've seen him debate him too.

4272
03:31:22,900 --> 03:31:23,733
Yeah.
But you liked these videos of the fake 

4273
03:31:25,731 --> 03:31:27,950
martial arts guys and they,
they,

4274
03:31:28,060 --> 03:31:30,680
they show up for the challenge because 
they've actually bought it.

4275
03:31:31,210 --> 03:31:32,660
Same with Dupo Depok.
Well,

4276
03:31:32,661 --> 03:31:34,070
this is what I'm trying to trying to get
at.

4277
03:31:34,100 --> 03:31:38,630
Isn't it interesting that in general,
the people who say,

4278
03:31:38,650 --> 03:31:40,670
you know,
immigration is a pure good.

4279
03:31:40,730 --> 03:31:42,860
There is no connection between Islam and
terror.

4280
03:31:44,690 --> 03:31:47,090
The only people who oppose a free 
trader,

4281
03:31:47,091 --> 03:31:47,924
protectionist.
These people know enough not to want to 

4282
03:31:51,951 --> 03:31:55,670
trounce us because what they're saying 
is wrong.

4283
03:31:55,820 --> 03:31:56,653
Right?
And they're expert enough to know that 

4284
03:31:58,971 --> 03:31:59,804
they are,
they've got a secret five point 

4285
03:32:02,750 --> 03:32:03,583
exploding heart technique or something 
and then they know it's nonsense and so 

4286
03:32:06,981 --> 03:32:09,720
they won't actually think they do.
Well then why don't,

4287
03:32:11,120 --> 03:32:12,020
why don't they want in?

4288
03:32:12,640 --> 03:32:14,540
Um,
I don't think they,

4289
03:32:14,790 --> 03:32:18,650
I don't think they necessarily do 
actually believe that they're wrong.

4290
03:32:18,740 --> 03:32:19,573
I do think that some of these people 
that are like super progressive and 

4291
03:32:23,870 --> 03:32:24,703
very,
very committed to some of these maybe 

4292
03:32:26,540 --> 03:32:30,680
illogical positions on some of these 
ideas are afraid of conflict though.

4293
03:32:31,010 --> 03:32:31,843
And I think that's one of the reasons 
why they shy towards progressivism 

4294
03:32:34,490 --> 03:32:37,010
towards socialism.
I don't think they let conflict.

4295
03:32:37,580 --> 03:32:38,340
Some of them.
No,

4296
03:32:38,340 --> 03:32:38,610
no,
no,

4297
03:32:38,610 --> 03:32:39,443
no.
They like to get together and scream at 

4298
03:32:40,281 --> 03:32:41,780
people.
This is what they'd like to get,

4299
03:32:41,800 --> 03:32:43,490
get,
get together in large groups.

4300
03:32:43,830 --> 03:32:44,663
Say We know how you sleep,
you fucking racist you fucking piece of 

4301
03:32:47,211 --> 03:32:48,740
shit,
but one on one.

4302
03:32:48,890 --> 03:32:49,723
They're cowards it like this is,
this is the type of person that would 

4303
03:32:53,001 --> 03:32:53,834
think it's a good idea to,
to show up and bang on someone's door 

4304
03:32:56,901 --> 03:32:58,160
and scare them in their home.

4305
03:32:58,340 --> 03:33:00,970
That type of person is not the type of 
person that would,

4306
03:33:01,160 --> 03:33:01,993
that looks forward to on an even 
battlefield engaging someone one on one 

4307
03:33:07,040 --> 03:33:11,000
and just just open communication.
That's not what they're dealing with.

4308
03:33:11,001 --> 03:33:12,530
They're doing is trying to silence 
people,

4309
03:33:12,590 --> 03:33:14,420
scare people,
intimidate people.

4310
03:33:14,600 --> 03:33:16,130
They're bullies,
intellectual bullies.

4311
03:33:16,280 --> 03:33:18,530
People are bullies are almost always 
insecure.

4312
03:33:18,560 --> 03:33:19,393
They're almost always scared.
So this is why there's been very few 

4313
03:33:21,501 --> 03:33:25,710
people that are jumping forward to,
to try to go to intellectual war.

4314
03:33:25,730 --> 03:33:30,730
When Rachel maddow or um,
Linda Sarsour one in.

4315
03:33:30,891 --> 03:33:31,724
I mean,
they're pretty.

4316
03:33:32,240 --> 03:33:34,560
You're dealing with two very different 
types of human beings.

4317
03:33:34,561 --> 03:33:35,840
So Rachel Maddow,
it's one thing.

4318
03:33:35,841 --> 03:33:38,160
Linda Sarsour is a very,
very seriously

4319
03:33:38,160 --> 03:33:40,820
religious person who's got some,
you know,

4320
03:33:41,100 --> 03:33:41,933
very deep beliefs as far as Islam.
She wears the hijab or she'd been just 

4321
03:33:45,601 --> 03:33:47,100
as two totally different.

4322
03:33:47,340 --> 03:33:48,110
No,
but it.

4323
03:33:48,110 --> 03:33:51,560
But if I listed a group of people like 
the late night comedians,

4324
03:33:52,070 --> 03:33:55,190
there's this very weird thing that they 
all seem to believe the same.

4325
03:33:55,370 --> 03:33:58,340
Like there was a secret meeting that 
they all agreed to a bunch of stuff that

4326
03:33:58,341 --> 03:33:59,130
I,
I,

4327
03:33:59,130 --> 03:34:00,920
I want to see the conference 
proceedings.

4328
03:34:00,980 --> 03:34:02,270
Like what's,
how so?

4329
03:34:02,660 --> 03:34:05,180
Well,
just that they all kind of know that the

4330
03:34:05,181 --> 03:34:06,890
Republicans are,
are all horrible.

4331
03:34:06,891 --> 03:34:10,290
The Democrats are basically good people,
that they,

4332
03:34:10,380 --> 03:34:13,730
they all know that climate science is 
settled science.

4333
03:34:14,300 --> 03:34:18,320
I mean,
there's some that they have these pretty

4334
03:34:18,321 --> 03:34:19,154
much open borders are a great thing and 
that everybody who doesn't believe in 

4335
03:34:23,361 --> 03:34:27,770
that is only so it's only not believing 
it because of xenophobia,

4336
03:34:28,340 --> 03:34:29,173
whatever these set of beliefs are.
I don't see these guys in open 

4337
03:34:33,620 --> 03:34:35,620
discussion particularly,
you know,

4338
03:34:35,630 --> 03:34:37,550
two hours long.
Well,

4339
03:34:37,551 --> 03:34:39,330
I don't think it's a.
That could,

4340
03:34:39,360 --> 03:34:40,193
could you get a Stephen Colbert,
Seth Meyers in here and have a 

4341
03:34:44,871 --> 03:34:46,610
discussion.
My guest is really.

4342
03:34:46,790 --> 03:34:47,620
Yeah,

4343
03:34:47,620 --> 03:34:49,990
I'm sure.
I'm sure.

4344
03:34:50,320 --> 03:34:51,153
I'm sure they'd be solid.
They're scared of having discussions 

4345
03:34:52,991 --> 03:34:55,910
with people,
but I only see them in ovarian.

4346
03:34:55,950 --> 03:34:58,540
They'd have to be very measured because 
they could lose their job.

4347
03:34:59,500 --> 03:35:01,000
That's not,
it's not that simple.

4348
03:35:01,270 --> 03:35:03,180
They make a tremendous amount of money.
Right?

4349
03:35:03,520 --> 03:35:06,380
If they came and said,
uh,

4350
03:35:06,460 --> 03:35:10,150
anything that could be misconstrued or 
misinterpreted,

4351
03:35:10,510 --> 03:35:11,343
even not even actually being something 
that's actually transphobic or 

4352
03:35:15,310 --> 03:35:16,143
homophobic or actually xenophobic,
if they said anything that could be 

4353
03:35:18,971 --> 03:35:19,804
taken out of context and put it in a 
small clip and then sent down and it 

4354
03:35:22,601 --> 03:35:25,360
goes viral and they're done.
Look at Megan Kelly.

4355
03:35:25,660 --> 03:35:30,660
Megan Kelly had a question about why 
can't you wear makeup to look like Diana

4356
03:35:31,960 --> 03:35:32,793
Ross?
Why can't you?

4357
03:35:32,860 --> 03:35:34,540
Well,
there's some good reasons why you can't.

4358
03:35:34,541 --> 03:35:36,610
There's some good racial history behind 
blackface.

4359
03:35:36,760 --> 03:35:37,593
However,
why is it that she can't even ask a 

4360
03:35:40,181 --> 03:35:42,310
question without losing her job?

4361
03:35:42,310 --> 03:35:46,620
Like that's it pulled up blog Kute.
We have to make a fucking statement.

4362
03:35:46,720 --> 03:35:50,050
We have bore violence,
but for exactly what you said about,

4363
03:35:50,170 --> 03:35:51,003
about the whole Kung Fu thing,
that is only can exist in a protected 

4364
03:35:54,221 --> 03:35:55,630
context.
Well,

4365
03:35:56,020 --> 03:35:56,853
first of all,
someone like Megan Kelly can only exist 

4366
03:35:59,351 --> 03:36:02,680
in a protected contest with all these 
people protected contest.

4367
03:36:02,681 --> 03:36:03,514
Even Cole bear is got to be one of the 
fastest minds on the planet that 

4368
03:36:07,150 --> 03:36:07,983
everybody I know who's smart,
who's done his show says he just thinks 

4369
03:36:09,821 --> 03:36:10,900
faster than you do.
Well,

4370
03:36:10,901 --> 03:36:14,370
I'm sure he's a very smart guy,
but.

4371
03:36:14,480 --> 03:36:16,710
But he's also a Catholic devout.
Yeah.

4372
03:36:17,330 --> 03:36:18,163
Yeah.
That.

4373
03:36:18,370 --> 03:36:21,040
Does this bother me.
It bothers me.

4374
03:36:21,320 --> 03:36:23,350
It doesn't bother me as an organization 
of kid fuckers.

4375
03:36:24,100 --> 03:36:24,933
Well,
well how come he's not speaking out 

4376
03:36:25,811 --> 03:36:28,640
against all those kids getting fucked?
Well,

4377
03:36:28,840 --> 03:36:31,960
if you're a Catholic,
like I was raised Catholic,

4378
03:36:31,961 --> 03:36:34,300
I mean I'm not saying that he is,
I'm not saying that the people,

4379
03:36:34,301 --> 03:36:36,490
he knows our,
but this is a giant

4380
03:36:36,580 --> 03:36:38,670
problem with that organization,
but.

4381
03:36:38,730 --> 03:36:39,563
But that's not what's bothering me.
What's not bothered with what I want to 

4382
03:36:44,321 --> 03:36:45,154
make sure that we're talking.
I think we're about to talk past each 

4383
03:36:47,111 --> 03:36:48,010
other,
so I want to bring it back.

4384
03:36:48,120 --> 03:36:51,770
Okay.
I think you just gave me an answer.

4385
03:36:52,480 --> 03:36:56,330
He can't appear in this kind of a 
context because that might come up

4386
03:36:58,310 --> 03:37:01,550
and he,
he needs to be in a world with much more

4387
03:37:01,551 --> 03:37:05,120
restricted rules where someone can't say
it's an organization of kid fucker.

4388
03:37:05,130 --> 03:37:06,350
That's right.
Yeah.

4389
03:37:06,880 --> 03:37:11,880
And it's not just more restricted world 
that that's the reason why that has been

4390
03:37:13,040 --> 03:37:13,873
able to survive.
That's what I'm trying to get that 

4391
03:37:15,241 --> 03:37:16,074
people don't talk about,
but is the idea that this is such a 

4392
03:37:19,730 --> 03:37:20,563
risk.
Like your point about Akita was if you 

4393
03:37:22,281 --> 03:37:25,340
happen to be unarmed and attacked by a 
man with a sword,

4394
03:37:25,341 --> 03:37:28,560
this might have some value.
It would have some value of someone that

4395
03:37:28,561 --> 03:37:31,020
attacked you in a very specific way.
It didn't understand what the key.

4396
03:37:31,040 --> 03:37:34,870
So the idea is that that's a very 
restricted rule set on which to fight.

4397
03:37:35,190 --> 03:37:37,850
Right.
So now maybe what you just said to me,

4398
03:37:37,970 --> 03:37:38,803
which could open this whole thing up,
is that all of these people can only 

4399
03:37:42,800 --> 03:37:43,633
apply their ability to have a back and 
forth of ideas if the rules are heavily 

4400
03:37:49,611 --> 03:37:50,444
restricted.

4401
03:37:50,480 --> 03:37:52,280
I don't necessarily think that's the 
case.

4402
03:37:52,281 --> 03:37:53,114
I think they could do it in other ways.
I think all of them are operating under 

4403
03:37:57,681 --> 03:38:00,320
this rule system because this rule 
system is how they get paid.

4404
03:38:00,560 --> 03:38:02,510
But I think Seth Meyers a very smart 
guy.

4405
03:38:02,511 --> 03:38:04,610
I know Jimmy Kimmel,
he's a very smart guy.

4406
03:38:04,611 --> 03:38:06,950
They can do whatever they want.
He could do a podcast.

4407
03:38:06,951 --> 03:38:09,920
He could do anything.
He could operate into any in any genre I

4408
03:38:09,921 --> 03:38:10,754
believe.
And I think I would imagine the same 

4409
03:38:11,961 --> 03:38:15,620
with [inaudible] I,
I mean I think Jimmy Fallon st thing,

4410
03:38:15,920 --> 03:38:16,753
but when they're forced into that box 
and this is 100 million dollar a year 

4411
03:38:19,910 --> 03:38:20,661
box,
you know,

4412
03:38:20,661 --> 03:38:21,494
it feels good and that box was fucking 
velvet walls and you get to drive a fat 

4413
03:38:24,831 --> 03:38:26,900
Mercedes and live in Beverly Hills.
Dude,

4414
03:38:26,910 --> 03:38:31,910
did you decide to stay in that box?
Maybe their mind is in that box.

4415
03:38:32,901 --> 03:38:33,734
Maybe they on a regular basis,
maybe there's not any restriction for 

4416
03:38:36,351 --> 03:38:38,570
them at all because this is how they 
operate all the time.

4417
03:38:38,600 --> 03:38:43,600
So I did the show with a Jordan and Ben 
Shapiro on Dave's a set right before Ben

4418
03:38:46,460 --> 03:38:47,293
Wind on real time with Bill Maher.
And Ben was kind of excited to do bill 

4419
03:38:50,871 --> 03:38:52,040
Maher and said,
oh,

4420
03:38:52,041 --> 03:38:55,460
I don't think he's going to rough me up.
I think he's going to be a gentleman.

4421
03:38:55,461 --> 03:38:58,910
I think he's one of us.
And then when ben sat down with bill,

4422
03:38:58,911 --> 03:38:59,744
we saw this thing that was very.
We were sort of hoping because bill is 

4423
03:39:03,291 --> 03:39:04,124
kind of the most towards us,
if anybody in that kind of mainstream 

4424
03:39:07,161 --> 03:39:09,650
environment.
And what I saw,

4425
03:39:09,680 --> 03:39:14,660
which I hadn't really appreciated,
was that bill was not doing this kind of

4426
03:39:14,661 --> 03:39:15,494
open discussion thing.
A lot of his tone was leading like 

4427
03:39:18,800 --> 03:39:21,140
surely you're not going to say that.
Know.

4428
03:39:21,980 --> 03:39:26,980
It wasn't just purely saying are you 
saying that it was all of this emotional

4429
03:39:27,291 --> 03:39:29,180
instruction?
Yes.

4430
03:39:29,330 --> 03:39:34,330
And it was clear to me that when I saw 
Ben on that in that context,

4431
03:39:36,320 --> 03:39:37,153
that there were only a few hours 
separating the two appearances and that 

4432
03:39:40,791 --> 03:39:41,624
the characteristics of that environment 
and we're builds show is the most like 

4433
03:39:44,901 --> 03:39:48,320
this show,
that it's just too different.

4434
03:39:48,560 --> 03:39:50,960
It's not,
it's not really the same ecosystem.

4435
03:39:50,961 --> 03:39:51,794
And you couldn't have an open debate 
unless it cuts off after seven minutes 

4436
03:39:55,581 --> 03:39:56,414
and the host is in control.
Well bill doesn't have any time that 

4437
03:39:59,090 --> 03:40:00,500
well,
this is part of the problem.

4438
03:40:00,650 --> 03:40:03,380
Part of the terms of they have a very 
restricted format.

4439
03:40:03,560 --> 03:40:08,360
He was doing a conversation with Steve 
Bannon and he was on Sam Harris' podcast

4440
03:40:08,361 --> 03:40:09,194
and he was talking about it and he said 
that one of the problems was he got to 

4441
03:40:11,001 --> 03:40:14,060
this point where like I was wanting to 
ask him more stuff,

4442
03:40:14,061 --> 03:40:16,430
but I ran out of time and I heard that.
I was like,

4443
03:40:16,431 --> 03:40:17,264
what the fuck kind of ancient system are
you operating under that you run out of 

4444
03:40:21,111 --> 03:40:21,950
time,
but let's take.

4445
03:40:22,010 --> 03:40:23,310
Let's take him at his word.
Well,

4446
03:40:23,450 --> 03:40:24,283
he definitely did run out of time,
but I assume that that's true and so 

4447
03:40:25,951 --> 03:40:27,500
that Bill Maher said,
hey guys,

4448
03:40:27,501 --> 03:40:27,950
I want to.

4449
03:40:27,950 --> 03:40:30,980
I want the following situation.
I want to continue to do realtime in the

4450
03:40:30,981 --> 03:40:31,814
same format that it's always been done,
but I want to have a podcast like Rogan 

4451
03:40:35,420 --> 03:40:36,253
where we take as much time as we need 
and I don't think those two things play 

4452
03:40:39,111 --> 03:40:40,220
together.
Oh,

4453
03:40:40,221 --> 03:40:41,760
they're fine together.
Yeah.

4454
03:40:41,910 --> 03:40:44,300
I feared that the,
that they're not.

4455
03:40:44,570 --> 03:40:45,500
Well,
here's the thing.

4456
03:40:45,501 --> 03:40:46,334
He went on Sam's podcast and I've.
I enjoyed him more than I enjoy him on 

4457
03:40:49,311 --> 03:40:50,144
the show.
I know because he had chances didn't 

4458
03:40:51,351 --> 03:40:53,360
look the same way on Dave Rubin show 
though.

4459
03:40:53,870 --> 03:40:56,420
He looked totally different.
How do I didn't say it?

4460
03:40:56,540 --> 03:40:57,710
Oh my God,
you got to see it.

4461
03:40:57,770 --> 03:40:58,940
Um,
you know,

4462
03:40:58,941 --> 03:41:00,560
Tucker,
uh,

4463
03:41:01,010 --> 03:41:01,843
you know,
I'm having my own weird issues where I 

4464
03:41:03,321 --> 03:41:04,154
used to,
my previous position was that Fox News 

4465
03:41:06,231 --> 03:41:09,420
is just propaganda and that Tucker was 
in that old car,

4466
03:41:09,500 --> 03:41:10,333
a crossfire situation way back when 
Tucker was like opening up as a 

4467
03:41:15,501 --> 03:41:17,510
different person saying you have the 
freedom.

4468
03:41:17,510 --> 03:41:19,760
You're the new.
I'm still stuck in the old.

4469
03:41:19,910 --> 03:41:21,110
Well,
he must really feel that.

4470
03:41:21,140 --> 03:41:23,330
You must really feel like he is like,
look,

4471
03:41:23,720 --> 03:41:27,710
that is what you have to do if you want 
to survive on Fox News.

4472
03:41:27,711 --> 03:41:30,320
And again,
it's a velvet coffin.

4473
03:41:30,620 --> 03:41:32,240
You're in there,
it's beautiful.

4474
03:41:32,250 --> 03:41:33,860
Yes,
you're getting paid shit.

4475
03:41:33,861 --> 03:41:34,694
Loads of money,
but you don't necessarily have the 

4476
03:41:36,831 --> 03:41:38,090
freedom to express.
First of all,

4477
03:41:38,091 --> 03:41:39,370
you don't have long form freedom,
right?

4478
03:41:39,710 --> 03:41:40,543
And you don't have the freedom to 
completely express yourself across the 

4479
03:41:43,221 --> 03:41:44,480
border.
Like you could.

4480
03:41:44,530 --> 03:41:46,520
You can't look at the left's ideas and 
say,

4481
03:41:46,521 --> 03:41:47,354
you know what?
I really liked the idea of universal 

4482
03:41:48,141 --> 03:41:48,974
healthcare.
I really liked the idea of universal 

4483
03:41:50,241 --> 03:41:51,074
basic income.
I really liked the idea of paying for 

4484
03:41:53,151 --> 03:41:55,790
people's school job.
I think you and I actually have a really

4485
03:41:55,791 --> 03:42:00,410
interesting difference of opinion.
I think your opinion is there is nothing

4486
03:42:00,411 --> 03:42:01,244
preventing you from staying in the 
velvet coffin and doing this style of 

4487
03:42:04,161 --> 03:42:04,994
podcast.

4488
03:42:05,090 --> 03:42:06,500
And my guest is.
I'm not saying that.

4489
03:42:06,800 --> 03:42:10,250
I'm only saying that with Bill Maher.
I think Tucker Carlson probably can't do

4490
03:42:10,251 --> 03:42:11,084
that.
I think of Tucker Carlson left colby or 

4491
03:42:12,471 --> 03:42:13,610
do it.
Yes.

4492
03:42:13,880 --> 03:42:15,740
I don't think so.
I think he could.

4493
03:42:15,741 --> 03:42:16,574
I don't think he would though.
I think he out of all of them and I 

4494
03:42:18,891 --> 03:42:20,600
think he's brilliant and don't get me 
wrong.

4495
03:42:20,601 --> 03:42:21,620
I'm what I said he's from,
uh,

4496
03:42:21,770 --> 03:42:23,820
an organization of kid fuckers.
Uh,

4497
03:42:23,840 --> 03:42:25,190
it's not him.
I mean,

4498
03:42:25,220 --> 03:42:27,180
but he's a part of the cabinet you could
do.

4499
03:42:27,650 --> 03:42:29,530
You could do any one of these people.
They're all bright.

4500
03:42:29,990 --> 03:42:31,980
Do you think is a big thing?
It's a big thing

4501
03:42:32,070 --> 03:42:33,450
in terms of,
first of all,

4502
03:42:33,451 --> 03:42:34,284
the actual reality of the organization 
and what they've done to protect people 

4503
03:42:37,291 --> 03:42:39,420
that have molested children.
It's unprecedented,

4504
03:42:39,530 --> 03:42:40,363
right?
It's also something that I was raised 

4505
03:42:41,701 --> 03:42:42,990
in.
I was Catholic.

4506
03:42:42,991 --> 03:42:43,824
I went to Catholic school.
I don't think that he wants to do that 

4507
03:42:48,931 --> 03:42:53,670
sort of wild country open type Internet 
show.

4508
03:42:53,671 --> 03:42:54,504
I think he enjoys wearing a tie and 
doing a straight up talk show like the 

4509
03:42:59,310 --> 03:43:01,530
Johnny Carson show or the Jay Leno show 
and I think he's a very,

4510
03:43:01,531 --> 03:43:03,300
very good at it and I don't think 
there's anything wrong with that.

4511
03:43:03,301 --> 03:43:05,940
I think a lot of people like that France
and I understand that,

4512
03:43:05,941 --> 03:43:07,680
but I think that's him.
I might be wrong.

4513
03:43:07,681 --> 03:43:08,514
I'm just assuming I could do different 
of what a what an action that if you 

4514
03:43:12,781 --> 03:43:16,830
tried to do both of these things,
you will be revealed.

4515
03:43:17,130 --> 03:43:21,780
You'd be caught between two worlds where
if I see what you're saying,

4516
03:43:21,840 --> 03:43:22,673
like I actually think that a lot of 
these ideas would collapse just the way 

4517
03:43:27,170 --> 03:43:30,480
Kung Fu collapsed.
I think you're probably right.

4518
03:43:30,600 --> 03:43:34,440
I think if you had two people having 
these conversations in long form,

4519
03:43:34,441 --> 03:43:35,274
instead of those CNN,
a three windows where they're just 

4520
03:43:38,850 --> 03:43:41,740
battling it out for six minutes and then
you know,

4521
03:43:41,790 --> 03:43:42,623
everybody's yelling over everybody.
That is the single worst way to argue 

4522
03:43:46,381 --> 03:43:48,540
ideas.
I think there's no gracie challenge.

4523
03:43:49,200 --> 03:43:50,033
There's not.
Well Jordan Peterson is kind of doing 

4524
03:43:51,421 --> 03:43:54,150
his own grave challenge that because 
gender.

4525
03:43:54,450 --> 03:43:56,700
Yeah.
And he's the only one they want.

4526
03:43:57,510 --> 03:43:58,710
Yes.
Well,

4527
03:43:58,750 --> 03:43:59,583
which is,
which is I think a puzzle hoists Gracie 

4528
03:44:01,080 --> 03:44:01,913
of the intellectual.

4529
03:44:05,460 --> 03:44:08,000
He's out there tapping wrestlers.
Um,

4530
03:44:08,070 --> 03:44:08,903
yeah.
I mean I think I'm not legitimately now 

4531
03:44:12,540 --> 03:44:13,373
he's worked his way past the Kung Fu 
people and he's now onto like a Olympic 

4532
03:44:16,381 --> 03:44:18,880
wrestlers,
like they're throwing at him this,

4533
03:44:18,881 --> 03:44:19,714
this latest one was very good.
She is much better than Kathy Newman 

4534
03:44:22,621 --> 03:44:23,454
lady.
She didn't make any of these ridiculous 

4535
03:44:25,351 --> 03:44:26,910
Straw man arguments.
She,

4536
03:44:26,940 --> 03:44:29,340
she came at him with her positions and 
our points.

4537
03:44:29,700 --> 03:44:30,533
It was interesting.
I think what you're saying is true for 

4538
03:44:33,571 --> 03:44:34,404
everybody except Bill Maher.
I think Bill Maher would hold his 

4539
03:44:37,771 --> 03:44:38,604
positions in podcast form and I think he
would just have more time to expand on 

4540
03:44:42,181 --> 03:44:45,040
them and I base this on him being on Sam
Harris,

4541
03:44:45,041 --> 03:44:49,680
his show and I find it to be very good.
It was the 10th anniversary of religious

4542
03:44:49,920 --> 03:44:52,530
and he was excellent on that.
I think he could do it,

4543
03:44:52,710 --> 03:44:53,850
but I think he's also.

4544
03:44:53,850 --> 03:44:55,200
He can say,
fuck you.

4545
03:44:55,320 --> 03:44:59,250
He got in trouble for dropping in n bomb
on his show in a joking for him.

4546
03:44:59,251 --> 03:45:00,084
I mean he's a different cat.
The whole thing is very different with 

4547
03:45:02,131 --> 03:45:03,180
him.
He's on Hbo,

4548
03:45:03,210 --> 03:45:06,180
but when Ice Cube came to him and said,
you can't do that.

4549
03:45:06,540 --> 03:45:07,373
It was painful to me because I'm just 
positive that he had a Carlin style 

4550
03:45:10,171 --> 03:45:11,004
attitude about that word.
That's tough because in this 

4551
03:45:14,611 --> 03:45:16,110
environment,
again,

4552
03:45:16,260 --> 03:45:17,093
that's where he makes his living.
He butters his bread over at HBO and if 

4553
03:45:19,471 --> 03:45:20,304
you wanted to have a long form 
conversation with that guy even on a 

4554
03:45:22,081 --> 03:45:25,440
podcast and he didn't have an hbo show,
that's one thing,

4555
03:45:25,441 --> 03:45:26,274
but if you do have an hbo show,
you have to have a totally different 

4556
03:45:28,681 --> 03:45:30,030
attitude.
One

4557
03:45:30,040 --> 03:45:32,440
wrong.
You're walking a tightrope,

4558
03:45:32,470 --> 03:45:33,303
but this is what I'm trying to get at is
is that we're too dangerous in some 

4559
03:45:36,311 --> 03:45:40,510
sense to play with because the velvet 
he's.

4560
03:45:40,540 --> 03:45:41,373
He's asked to.
I've talked to bill and I actually went 

4561
03:45:44,141 --> 03:45:45,850
back and forth on an email about 
something.

4562
03:45:46,460 --> 03:45:47,720
I dropped the ball,
but no,

4563
03:45:47,770 --> 03:45:50,320
he would do anybody's podcasts.
I don't think that's the case.

4564
03:45:50,590 --> 03:45:51,423
He could do his own podcast as well.
I agree that he would be the one most 

4565
03:45:54,311 --> 03:45:56,200
likely to be able to do both.
He could do it.

4566
03:45:56,270 --> 03:45:57,190
Yeah,
he could do it.

4567
03:45:57,370 --> 03:46:00,100
I think all of them could do it.
I think Seth Meyers could do it too.

4568
03:46:00,101 --> 03:46:03,310
I think Jimmy Kimmel could probably do 
it as good or better than any of them.

4569
03:46:03,760 --> 03:46:05,680
Jimmy absolutely could do it.
I mean,

4570
03:46:05,710 --> 03:46:09,100
the only thing that's holding him back,
he's a man of his ideas.

4571
03:46:09,400 --> 03:46:10,120
He's not gonna.

4572
03:46:10,120 --> 03:46:10,953
He's probably the least likely to alter 
or manipulate his ideas of anybody 

4573
03:46:15,521 --> 03:46:17,440
that's ever done one of those late night
talk show host.

4574
03:46:17,950 --> 03:46:18,783
He's just operating inside a format 
where you don't swear and you have a 

4575
03:46:22,391 --> 03:46:25,540
certain amount of time and you try to be
funny and you say insightful stuff,

4576
03:46:25,810 --> 03:46:28,780
but he's a very ethical guy and he's 
also a very,

4577
03:46:28,781 --> 03:46:29,614
very smart guy and he's also very rich.
He's got a shitload of fuck you money 

4578
03:46:32,970 --> 03:46:33,803
and I think Jimmy Kimmel do it easily.
I think a lot of people could do it 

4579
03:46:35,921 --> 03:46:37,240
easily and I think they're going to have
to.

4580
03:46:37,660 --> 03:46:38,493
I think some some point along the line 
they're going to realize that the 

4581
03:46:41,420 --> 03:46:43,360
restrictions that they're operating 
under,

4582
03:46:43,361 --> 03:46:46,330
unless they really enjoy that format,
I don't think those formats are going to

4583
03:46:46,331 --> 03:46:47,164
be there that long.
I think those formats are a lot like 

4584
03:46:48,851 --> 03:46:51,550
sitcoms,
like they're slowly starting to vanish.

4585
03:46:51,820 --> 03:46:52,653
You know,
for every one the Roseanne show that 

4586
03:46:54,131 --> 03:46:56,220
comes up,
which is kind of nostalgic and you know,

4587
03:46:56,300 --> 03:46:57,133
that runs into its own disaster.
How many new sitcoms are there that 

4588
03:46:59,771 --> 03:47:01,210
everybody's aware of?
Shit.

4589
03:47:01,211 --> 03:47:03,070
It used to be every time there was a new
sitcom,

4590
03:47:03,071 --> 03:47:05,680
whether it was friends or you know,
fill in the blank,

4591
03:47:05,710 --> 03:47:06,543
whatever the show Seinfeld there was.
Everybody was talking about these new 

4592
03:47:08,921 --> 03:47:09,754
sitcoms.
Nobody fucking talks about sitcoms 

4593
03:47:12,341 --> 03:47:13,174
anymore.
This is the,

4594
03:47:13,470 --> 03:47:16,360
this is the thing I took on this morning
on twitter,

4595
03:47:17,080 --> 03:47:17,913
which was a Dave Rubin and Bret 
Weinstein and myself were talking about 

4596
03:47:22,361 --> 03:47:27,361
this phenomena of very high follower 
counts with cycle low engagement.

4597
03:47:28,930 --> 03:47:29,980
Oh yeah,
that's fake.

4598
03:47:30,220 --> 03:47:32,350
But those are fake followers.
That's what that is.

4599
03:47:32,380 --> 03:47:33,460
Well,
it may be,

4600
03:47:33,490 --> 03:47:34,323
but it's a lot of it.
But it's very interesting that we're 

4601
03:47:35,921 --> 03:47:36,754
talking about getting rid of visible 
follower counts and getting rid of 

4602
03:47:40,001 --> 03:47:40,600
likes.

4603
03:47:40,600 --> 03:47:41,870
Who's saying that?
Um,

4604
03:47:42,160 --> 03:47:42,993
apparently there's discussion about a 
Jack May have floated some trial 

4605
03:47:45,731 --> 03:47:49,780
balloons that twitter is going to try to
improve the level of conversation and by

4606
03:47:49,781 --> 03:47:50,614
getting rid of follower counts and 
removing likes can imagine thinking 

4607
03:47:54,470 --> 03:47:55,303
you're going to improve the level of 
conversation by getting rid of a heart 

4608
03:47:58,570 --> 03:48:00,680
that you can switch it on someone's Id.
Art,

4609
03:48:01,330 --> 03:48:03,570
it's literally a heart,
but it's feedback.

4610
03:48:03,620 --> 03:48:04,453
You're clicking on a heart.
It's on instagram and on twitter it's a 

4611
03:48:06,521 --> 03:48:07,570
heart.
It's like,

4612
03:48:08,540 --> 03:48:10,090
here's your little heart.
I love you.

4613
03:48:10,470 --> 03:48:12,640
I'm going to get rid of love Jack.
Come on,

4614
03:48:12,641 --> 03:48:14,240
Jack.
Going to get rid of love,

4615
03:48:15,690 --> 03:48:17,530
terrifying human being.
Why?

4616
03:48:17,590 --> 03:48:19,330
What?
What's terrifying about it?

4617
03:48:19,380 --> 03:48:22,000
Because I'm seeing you blowing kisses in
my general direction.

4618
03:48:22,001 --> 03:48:22,834
I'm remembering all the videos I've 
watched where you attack some sort of a 

4619
03:48:25,121 --> 03:48:28,180
punching bag with this vicious spinning 
elbow or something.

4620
03:48:28,180 --> 03:48:29,210
I'm just thinking like,
okay,

4621
03:48:29,580 --> 03:48:31,880
listen,
we're talking about ideas here.

4622
03:48:31,881 --> 03:48:32,930
You can't.
No,

4623
03:48:33,020 --> 03:48:33,853
I want to get out on that stuff later.
I want to have a midlife crisis with 

4624
03:48:37,130 --> 03:48:39,020
some instruction for.
I think we got to end this.

4625
03:48:39,410 --> 03:48:41,690
We've done four hours and 10.
Are you kidding me?

4626
03:48:41,750 --> 03:48:44,540
I to show you what they said though.
This was just a couple of weeks ago.

4627
03:48:45,300 --> 03:48:46,133
We've been saying for awhile,
we are rethinking everything about the 

4628
03:48:48,861 --> 03:48:49,694
service to ensure we are incentivizing 
healthy conversation that includes the 

4629
03:48:53,450 --> 03:48:54,283
like button.
We are in the early stages of the work 

4630
03:48:57,530 --> 03:48:58,363
and have no plans to share right now and
this is in response to telegraph the 

4631
03:49:03,801 --> 03:49:04,634
Telegraph saying twitter to remove the 
tool in a bid to improve the quality of 

4632
03:49:07,611 --> 03:49:08,444
debate.
I think something really weird is going 

4633
03:49:09,591 --> 03:49:10,424
on.
What is the quality of debate and by 

4634
03:49:11,601 --> 03:49:13,850
whose definition I mean,
and you're not gonna you're.

4635
03:49:13,910 --> 03:49:17,330
You're definitely not going to change 
the way people interact with each other.

4636
03:49:17,750 --> 03:49:18,583
You're just not.
People interact with each other because 

4637
03:49:19,971 --> 03:49:22,550
they're anonymous.
They have incentive to talk shit.

4638
03:49:22,580 --> 03:49:23,480
It's fun.
Okay,

4639
03:49:23,481 --> 03:49:24,314
so the one thing I could ask you as we 
close this thing out is if we could 

4640
03:49:27,381 --> 03:49:29,930
plug.
I'm not only my twitter,

4641
03:49:29,931 --> 03:49:33,650
which is my main thing that I'm trying 
to diversify into instagram and youtube.

4642
03:49:33,651 --> 03:49:37,010
Should I get shut off twitter?
Are you worried about getting shut off?

4643
03:49:37,190 --> 03:49:38,023
I'm always worried,
but you don't say anything inflammatory 

4644
03:49:39,620 --> 03:49:42,320
like would you?
You're very logical and reasonable guy,

4645
03:49:43,550 --> 03:49:45,740
so you think it's really gotten to that 
point?

4646
03:49:45,770 --> 03:49:46,330
Well,
yeah.

4647
03:49:46,330 --> 03:49:49,400
I'm actually worried that by being 
logical and reasonable,

4648
03:49:49,401 --> 03:49:53,090
I have more of a risk because the things
that I'm saying,

4649
03:49:53,860 --> 03:49:56,600
like we're also recognizing intellectual
and very left wing.

4650
03:49:56,601 --> 03:49:59,750
Your progressive.
So why would they shut you off?

4651
03:50:00,140 --> 03:50:00,973
Oh,
I think because they're much more 

4652
03:50:02,001 --> 03:50:02,834
worried about a progressive.
Who says that the current 

4653
03:50:04,101 --> 03:50:04,934
progressiveness is absolute stupidity.
That's much more dangerous than some 

4654
03:50:08,331 --> 03:50:09,164
right winger.
Who was always against anything that's 

4655
03:50:10,161 --> 03:50:12,290
progressive.
Interesting.

4656
03:50:12,770 --> 03:50:14,720
There's a war of foot.
You love that kind of stuff.

4657
03:50:14,721 --> 03:50:16,490
You'll have that cloak and dagger type 
Shit,

4658
03:50:16,580 --> 03:50:17,391
don't you?
Yeah.

4659
03:50:17,391 --> 03:50:18,224
Well,
I'm part of the ineffectual Dork with 

4660
03:50:20,320 --> 03:50:23,360
your stuff.
I don't say ineffectual.

4661
03:50:23,480 --> 03:50:27,470
I know you said international direct 
web.

4662
03:50:27,860 --> 03:50:28,790
Yeah,
that's what I call.

4663
03:50:28,830 --> 03:50:29,720
Listen.
I have to.

4664
03:50:30,170 --> 03:50:32,360
I can't call myself a part of the dark 
web.

4665
03:50:32,361 --> 03:50:34,490
That's just too ridiculous for a man in 
my position.

4666
03:50:34,520 --> 03:50:35,353
Okay.
We'll see what the.

4667
03:50:35,560 --> 03:50:40,560
That to one of a thousand people that 
speak the humor across the lands.

4668
03:50:42,110 --> 03:50:44,170
Listen,
this is effortless.

4669
03:50:44,280 --> 03:50:45,290
Yeah,
I can do this.

4670
03:50:45,500 --> 03:50:49,490
I did that.
I had no idea it was four hours flew by.

4671
03:50:49,520 --> 03:50:50,331
It was awesome.
All right,

4672
03:50:50,331 --> 03:50:52,450
well you can I just tell you,
just give the,

4673
03:50:52,480 --> 03:50:54,620
the,
the names please do.

4674
03:50:54,700 --> 03:50:57,900
All right.
I think I am.

4675
03:51:00,530 --> 03:51:03,760
It really is 5:10.
She's Eric r Weinstein on.

4676
03:51:04,060 --> 03:51:05,870
No,
I'm Eric r Weinstein and twitter.

4677
03:51:05,930 --> 03:51:08,080
I'm Eric Weinstein,
Phd.

4678
03:51:08,240 --> 03:51:12,800
I think on instagram and on my 
instagram.

4679
03:51:12,870 --> 03:51:16,230
Uh,

4680
03:51:17,070 --> 03:51:18,600
Eric r Weinstein,

4681
03:51:18,601 --> 03:51:20,850

Eric Weinstein.

4682
03:51:20,851 --> 03:51:21,710
Phd.
Yeah.

4683
03:51:21,750 --> 03:51:25,020
And if you can't find his instagram,
I linked it on my instagram.

4684
03:51:25,100 --> 03:51:26,910
All right Joe,
