1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,450
The joe rogan experience when I was,

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:03,450
when you were talking about,

3
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:03,720
uh,

4
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:07,950
to change the subject a little bit when
you were talking about being honest and

5
00:00:07,951 --> 00:00:08,550
crazy.

6
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:09,990
I had a great acting teacher,

7
00:00:09,991 --> 00:00:12,990
I think I can say his name because he
actually talks about it and he's a really

8
00:00:12,991 --> 00:00:13,561
good teacher.

9
00:00:13,561 --> 00:00:15,360
He was a medic in Vietnam for two tours.

10
00:00:15,361 --> 00:00:16,111
He's seen everything,

11
00:00:16,111 --> 00:00:16,740
you know,

12
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:19,830
and he was like one of the first people
that somebody said to him in class,

13
00:00:19,831 --> 00:00:20,011
you know,

14
00:00:20,011 --> 00:00:21,690
he's take class from seven to 12.

15
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:22,471
I'll say it,

16
00:00:22,471 --> 00:00:22,981
cause I love him.

17
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:26,420
His name is Richard Lawson is a really
special guy and he's got to Kuwait acting

18
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:26,701
class.

19
00:00:26,701 --> 00:00:27,121
And he said,

20
00:00:27,121 --> 00:00:27,600
uh,

21
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:28,021
somebody said,

22
00:00:28,021 --> 00:00:29,120
I never seen you yawn.

23
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:29,821
And he goes,

24
00:00:29,821 --> 00:00:30,151
yeah,

25
00:00:30,151 --> 00:00:32,400
because I don't put my
attention on myself.

26
00:00:32,401 --> 00:00:33,930
I put my attention out there.

27
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,430
I'm not thinking about being tired.

28
00:00:35,431 --> 00:00:36,750
I don't focus on the fatigue.

29
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:37,081
And they were like,

30
00:00:37,081 --> 00:00:37,381
what do you mean?

31
00:00:37,381 --> 00:00:38,070
He goes,

32
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:41,580
I learned in Vietnam
watching when a Viet Cong,

33
00:00:41,581 --> 00:00:42,690
when an American would get shot,

34
00:00:42,691 --> 00:00:44,130
a lot of times they'd go into shock.

35
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:45,660
When you get shot you go,

36
00:00:45,661 --> 00:00:46,021
oh my God,

37
00:00:46,021 --> 00:00:46,501
I get shot.

38
00:00:46,501 --> 00:00:47,570
And a lot of the time what goes,

39
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:50,610
what causes you to go into shock is
also a notion that you get shot in your

40
00:00:50,611 --> 00:00:54,510
heart starts beating really fast cause
you're terrified because you might die.

41
00:00:54,511 --> 00:00:54,951
I mean you,

42
00:00:54,951 --> 00:00:55,950
you go into that notion,

43
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:57,330
the Vietcong,

44
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:00,600
they get shot in these horrific injuries
and you could still interrogate them

45
00:01:00,601 --> 00:01:02,520
cause they'd be putting
their attention out there.

46
00:01:02,521 --> 00:01:06,540
They would immediately start focusing and
their whole way of thinking anyway was

47
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:07,830
they were a leaf on a tree.

48
00:01:07,831 --> 00:01:08,664
They weren't the tree.

49
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:11,790
So for whatever reason they
wouldn't go into shock as quickly.

50
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:14,130
They would immediately
put their attention on,

51
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:14,610
you know,

52
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:15,510
something in front of them.

53
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:17,700
So they weren't focusing on the wound.

54
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,090
And he said he used to see that when
he was a medic taking care of people.

55
00:01:21,091 --> 00:01:24,750
And he saw such a fundamental striking
difference in the mindset between the

56
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:26,940
Vietcong and an American Gi.

57
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:32,070
And he was so impressed with their ability
to focus on anything but themselves.

58
00:01:32,071 --> 00:01:33,540
They were not part of this equation.

59
00:01:33,541 --> 00:01:37,410
They were a very small part of the
equation that he used it in his own life.

60
00:01:37,411 --> 00:01:37,651
You know,

61
00:01:37,651 --> 00:01:37,871
he,

62
00:01:37,871 --> 00:01:40,980
he would use this idea of
he was tired or you know,

63
00:01:40,981 --> 00:01:45,070
feeling sick that he would just literally
put his mind over there off himself,

64
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:49,320
take himself out of the and actually
watch himself move through what he had to

65
00:01:49,321 --> 00:01:49,980
get done.

66
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:53,640
I bet you probably get a lot more energy
out of just doing that then opposed to

67
00:01:53,641 --> 00:01:56,040
like festering on the idea that
you're tired of the course,

68
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:56,670
which is,

69
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:00,050
I always found that the things that I'd
just test the most and other people are

70
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:03,270
the things I'm terrified of seeing in
myself and the person who doesn't know how

71
00:02:03,271 --> 00:02:06,360
to like push through shit and
get things done and just come on,

72
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:06,661
come on,

73
00:02:06,661 --> 00:02:06,991
get up,

74
00:02:06,991 --> 00:02:07,710
just do it.

75
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:08,281
Get the done,

76
00:02:08,281 --> 00:02:08,850
get it done,

77
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:09,061
get it.

78
00:02:09,061 --> 00:02:10,620
I'm not terrified of being that guy.

79
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:13,290
I'm terrified and not getting
shit done and you know,

80
00:02:13,291 --> 00:02:16,530
and it forces me to find it
to be gross and other people,

81
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:16,790
you know?

82
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:17,480
Right.

83
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:22,260
It's like one of the things that scares
me about them taking wrestling out of

84
00:02:22,261 --> 00:02:23,094
the Olympics.

85
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:23,461
Oh,

86
00:02:23,461 --> 00:02:24,270
that's the worst.

87
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:24,841
It's crazy.

88
00:02:24,841 --> 00:02:26,070
All the sport in the Olympics,

89
00:02:26,071 --> 00:02:29,070
it's and the fact that it's
not even in every high school.

90
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:34,970
I think there's some real lessons to be
learned that a lot of people are never

91
00:02:35,491 --> 00:02:39,240
going to learn and those lessons are
how to get through difficult shit,

92
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:42,810
how to get through the physical difficult
chicken and doing things physical,

93
00:02:42,811 --> 00:02:44,040
which a lot of people were avoiding.

94
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:49,340
You get a more balanced mastery of your
own mind and that's a fucking important

95
00:02:49,621 --> 00:02:53,400
aspect of being the human being and a
lot of people are skipping that step.

96
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,480
A lot of people are skipping that stuff.

97
00:02:55,481 --> 00:02:56,220
I agree.

98
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:56,790
It can.

99
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:58,380
It can fuck you in the long run,

100
00:02:58,381 --> 00:02:58,681
man.

101
00:02:58,681 --> 00:03:02,080
It can give you the extra push
toward saying something stupid.

102
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:07,000
It can give you the extra bad energy to
take a left turn and I'll look to get

103
00:03:07,001 --> 00:03:07,900
good at anything.

104
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:08,290
You know?

105
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:10,420
Let's take wrestling or
Jujitsu as an example.

106
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:11,290
If you're you,

107
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:12,280
if you want to get good,

108
00:03:12,281 --> 00:03:13,750
you better work at what you're bad at.

109
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,950
You better work at the things,

110
00:03:14,951 --> 00:03:15,481
you're bad at it.

111
00:03:15,481 --> 00:03:18,610
You can't go in there and tap people out
with the stuff that you constantly know

112
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:21,160
cause the guys that are working on the
stuff they're not good at are going to

113
00:03:21,161 --> 00:03:21,840
surpass you.

114
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,530
[inaudible] you just
learned that the hard way.

115
00:03:23,531 --> 00:03:23,780
If you,

116
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:25,900
if you're not careful and I
think everything is that way,

117
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:26,801
you know you better,

118
00:03:26,801 --> 00:03:30,010
you better work at what you are
the and you gain a lot of it.

119
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:31,270
A lot of that times I'll tell you,

120
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:31,720
you know,

121
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,790
hey you better music better
than musical instrument.

122
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:35,080
Learn how to do something.

123
00:03:35,081 --> 00:03:35,940
What I like about doing,

124
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:36,813
playing the drums,

125
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:40,750
I got to learn how to do four different
things with which each limb it's really

126
00:03:40,751 --> 00:03:41,650
difficult to do.

127
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:46,210
I gain a lot from just the practice and
the stretch of trying to learn how to be

128
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:46,850
a,

129
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:49,030
have all four limbs doing
something independent.

130
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:49,350
That's,

131
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:50,410
that's really interesting to me.

132
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:53,560
It actually changes my whole mindset.

133
00:03:53,561 --> 00:03:56,140
I actually approach things very
differently for the rest of my day.

134
00:03:56,141 --> 00:03:56,831
It's really weird.

135
00:03:56,831 --> 00:03:58,570
I can't explain how or define how,

136
00:03:58,571 --> 00:03:59,830
but it does make a difference.

137
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:01,930
I think when you take on new activities,

138
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,741
your mind,

139
00:04:02,741 --> 00:04:05,110
when it starts concentrating
on some new thing,

140
00:04:05,111 --> 00:04:08,860
whether it's playing the drums or a new
game you're trying to master whatever

141
00:04:08,861 --> 00:04:09,694
the fuck it is.

142
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:13,690
When your mind gets really enthusiastic
about things and starts trying to figure

143
00:04:13,691 --> 00:04:18,040
things out and working towards
and achieving like little goals,

144
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:19,090
you get invigorated.

145
00:04:19,091 --> 00:04:19,480
Yeah.

146
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:23,230
It's this feeling of invigoration whenever
your pursue anything that you find to

147
00:04:23,231 --> 00:04:23,711
be fun.

148
00:04:23,711 --> 00:04:25,300
Anything that you find to be stimulating,

149
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:30,070
but the real thing is like everybody's
idea of what stimulating is different.

150
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:35,380
It just is thanking God and the real
problem is like that poor kid is fucking

151
00:04:35,381 --> 00:04:35,681
dad.

152
00:04:35,681 --> 00:04:37,750
Keeps pushed him into football
and he really wants to suck.

153
00:04:37,751 --> 00:04:38,584
Cock a dance.

154
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:39,370
You know?

155
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:43,150
I mean Dan probably be the best
dancing cock sucker a long time.

156
00:04:43,151 --> 00:04:43,211
We,

157
00:04:43,211 --> 00:04:43,990
Billy Elliot,

158
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:44,950
Remember Billy Elliot?

159
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:45,790
It's like ballet.

160
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,040
He's do bought license.

161
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,370
I didn't see the movie.

162
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:49,204
Billy Elliot.

163
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:50,223
I'm a man.

164
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,800
Craig from an actual man.

165
00:04:51,801 --> 00:04:52,300
That's what they need.

166
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:55,000
Baby grinder kits for kid Grindr.

167
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:55,211
No,

168
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:56,110
he comes from a coal mine.

169
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:57,690
I didn't even know what bill custom,

170
00:04:57,770 --> 00:04:58,810
a coal mining family,

171
00:04:58,811 --> 00:05:01,450
and the guy's like this hard ass
coal miner in the north of England,

172
00:05:01,451 --> 00:05:03,160
like Manchester in this movie,

173
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:06,540
but just an English movie from Manchester
and the kid wants to be a valid

174
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:07,510
independent movie.

175
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:08,291
Uh,

176
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:08,561
no,

177
00:05:08,561 --> 00:05:09,610
it's really popular that,

178
00:05:09,611 --> 00:05:10,630
but he wants to be a ballet dancer.

179
00:05:10,631 --> 00:05:11,890
He's an amazing ballet dancer.

180
00:05:11,891 --> 00:05:12,820
He's an incredible dancer.

181
00:05:12,821 --> 00:05:14,680
And his father's like Bali,

182
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:16,383
Bali,

183
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:17,540
like he can't believe it.

184
00:05:17,541 --> 00:05:18,221
He's so angry.

185
00:05:18,221 --> 00:05:18,940
He's like,

186
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:19,630
Bali,

187
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:21,930
my son's going to do follow my,

188
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:22,361
you know,

189
00:05:22,361 --> 00:05:24,070
and it's just a disaster for him.

190
00:05:24,071 --> 00:05:25,360
But that's what he is.

191
00:05:25,361 --> 00:05:26,770
He's a fucking ballet dancer.

192
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,701
That's a great movie.

193
00:05:27,701 --> 00:05:29,050
You got to find out what you grow,

194
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:30,070
what you groove is.

195
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:30,401
Yeah.

196
00:05:30,401 --> 00:05:31,180
What's your groove?

197
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:32,280
Is it playing the drums?

198
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:33,700
It goes back to the truth.

199
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:35,440
What is it your truth?

200
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:36,310
If you try to,

201
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:37,690
if you try to avoid it,

202
00:05:37,691 --> 00:05:38,890
you're going to get yourself in some,

203
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,720
you're going to be on antidepressants.

204
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:42,280
You're going to have to mask that,

205
00:05:42,281 --> 00:05:42,521
that,

206
00:05:42,521 --> 00:05:42,971
that true.

207
00:05:42,971 --> 00:05:43,960
Just do what you're supposed to.

208
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:48,970
It is amazing that there's no one that's
ever come out with a really effective

209
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:54,130
guidebook of how to live life
in a successful direction
like no one could ever

210
00:05:54,371 --> 00:05:55,870
tell you how to be successful.

211
00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:00,320
What is successful to you is
not successful someone else,

212
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:00,771
et Cetera,

213
00:06:00,771 --> 00:06:01,190
et cetera.

214
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:01,490
Yeah,

215
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:05,360
but to teach you how to
manage the whole big package.

216
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:06,680
It's like the,

217
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:07,041
the,

218
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:12,041
the whole idea of managing the thoughts
in your mind is just missing from

219
00:06:13,401 --> 00:06:14,070
school.

220
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:17,360
This did I have to just tell
you I'm laughing because when,

221
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,690
when people are self conscious,

222
00:06:18,691 --> 00:06:19,471
like in my class,

223
00:06:19,471 --> 00:06:21,160
this Guy Richard Lawson is acting teacher.

224
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:22,403
Somebody who was like,

225
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:23,850
whenever I like this guy,

226
00:06:23,851 --> 00:06:26,100
this guy was like embarrassed
that he'd done something.

227
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:26,461
It's like,

228
00:06:26,461 --> 00:06:26,791
I'm fine.

229
00:06:26,791 --> 00:06:28,890
I'm just embarrassed by it
and my teacher goes like this.

230
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:29,130
He goes,

231
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:29,963
hey,

232
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:31,290
I fucked the pig.

233
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:32,461
I have.

234
00:06:32,461 --> 00:06:32,761
I went,

235
00:06:32,761 --> 00:06:32,921
what?

236
00:06:32,921 --> 00:06:33,420
And he goes,

237
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:34,080
yeah,

238
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:34,980
I fucked the pig.

239
00:06:34,981 --> 00:06:36,300
I'm writing about it right now.

240
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:37,770
You don't think that's embarrassing.

241
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:39,450
I'll tell you everything about myself.

242
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:41,160
I've fucked a pig when I was a kid.

243
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,113
How about that?

244
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,560
And everybody just stopped.

245
00:06:43,561 --> 00:06:44,190
And they were like,

246
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:44,371
well,

247
00:06:44,371 --> 00:06:44,791
you know what,

248
00:06:44,791 --> 00:06:46,130
if you're going to admit that I can make,

249
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:47,760
I can admit fucking anything.

250
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:51,210
And it just liberates you when like
somebody who's a leader in a group goes,

251
00:06:51,211 --> 00:06:51,631
hey guys,

252
00:06:51,631 --> 00:06:51,871
guys,

253
00:06:51,871 --> 00:06:52,111
guys,

254
00:06:52,111 --> 00:06:53,010
in case you guys,

255
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,020
can everybody stop acting
like a fucking Puritan,

256
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:56,610
cause we're all pretty fucked up and,

257
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:56,941
and,

258
00:06:56,941 --> 00:06:58,200
and I'm the most fucked up.

259
00:06:58,201 --> 00:06:58,531
Bang.

260
00:06:58,531 --> 00:06:59,280
You know?

261
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,170
So I don't know if there
was a point to that,

262
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:01,470
but,

263
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:01,770
but,

264
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:03,900
which has kind of piggybacking
on what you're trying to say,

265
00:07:03,901 --> 00:07:04,740
which is essentially,

266
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:05,340
you know,

267
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:05,791
just,

268
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:07,980
just whatever your fucking truth is,

269
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:11,280
just be honest with yourself and maybe
with a couple of your friends and then

270
00:07:11,281 --> 00:07:13,020
just fucking follow that.

271
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:23,290
Okay.
