1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,650
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:02,230
You don't,

3
00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:06,240
you're not famous video of the guy that
sets up his laptop and then records

4
00:00:06,241 --> 00:00:08,040
maid's coming in while he's jacking off.

5
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:12,030
So like just explain the
say that like we know,

6
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:12,943
oh I thought you know,

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,450
thing that you watch every
day before you do anything.

8
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:19,290
There's this hilarious guy and you could
find that [inaudible] dot com is one of

9
00:00:19,291 --> 00:00:22,800
the websites that has it and it's just
this guy that puts his laptop here and he

10
00:00:22,801 --> 00:00:23,940
puts headphones on.

11
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:25,200
He just waits for the maid.

12
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:30,230
And then when she comes in he records
like him jerking off and he has made her

13
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:32,070
as you're looking at a screen?

14
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:32,580
No,

15
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:33,270
he's just like,

16
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:34,230
you can't see his face.

17
00:00:34,231 --> 00:00:35,700
You just see it's from his dick.

18
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:37,170
Oh my front door.

19
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:40,950
So like the maids come
in one after another,

20
00:00:40,951 --> 00:00:42,150
one after another and they're like,

21
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:43,440
they all do different things.

22
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,070
Most of them were like,

23
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:44,470
oh my God.

24
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:45,080
So sorry.

25
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:47,280
So I'm just sit there and
just slowly turn around.

26
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:51,680
But his mission was to actually have
somebody like fuck him or give him a blow

27
00:00:51,681 --> 00:00:52,170
job.

28
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:55,500
He just released a second
one where finally at the end,

29
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:56,850
I almost don't want to give it away.

30
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:00,570
I made does come up and just start staring
at it and then slowly walks up and he

31
00:01:00,571 --> 00:01:00,810
goes,

32
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:00,991
Oh,

33
00:01:00,991 --> 00:01:01,824
do you want this?

34
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:02,340
And,

35
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:03,300
and he goes,

36
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,230
yes I do.

37
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:06,900
And the guys starts sucking
him off on the video.

38
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:07,570
No,

39
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:08,400
it was a male.

40
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,031
I miss you.

41
00:01:09,031 --> 00:01:12,020
I promise you the twist is
that there's a male made.

42
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:12,990
No,

43
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:13,410
listen,

44
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:14,250
I don't know if you know this,

45
00:01:14,251 --> 00:01:15,390
but I used to be on fear factor.

46
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:15,720
Right?

47
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,010
I know about reality TV.

48
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:18,163
I don't buy that.

49
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:19,993
I don't see that.

50
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:23,110
Please watch the videos
watching guys talk.

51
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:23,401
You guys,

52
00:01:23,401 --> 00:01:23,670
Dick,

53
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:24,503
I know what you're doing.

54
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,630
What you're doing is trying to trick you.

55
00:01:27,631 --> 00:01:28,530
Try to convert us,

56
00:01:28,531 --> 00:01:28,920
bro.

57
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,110
You know you don't know me as
well as you think you know me.

58
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:32,010
I'm not that dumb.

59
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:32,371
Okay.

60
00:01:32,371 --> 00:01:33,190
How dare you.

61
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:33,480
Well,

62
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:38,480
if trying to trick me into 500 other
videos of women turning them down over and

63
00:01:39,121 --> 00:01:40,260
over and over again and he,

64
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:41,460
I would not,

65
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,140
I would be on your boat to thicken.

66
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:43,621
It was fake.

67
00:01:43,621 --> 00:01:44,071
But it's,

68
00:01:44,071 --> 00:01:44,904
he's been doing this,

69
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:49,940
I've known it came out through [inaudible]
is the one of the worst detectives in

70
00:01:49,951 --> 00:01:50,940
the history of Scotland.

71
00:01:50,941 --> 00:01:51,774
Yard help.

72
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:54,240
He's followed bad leads.

73
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:56,221
He said.

74
00:01:56,221 --> 00:01:56,450
Yeah,

75
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:57,450
inspector Crusoe.

76
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,870
His first video came out
like three to five years ago.

77
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,833
He's gotta be

78
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:03,140
your honor.

79
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:03,490
Yeah.

80
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:05,150
There's no need to further investigate it.

81
00:02:05,151 --> 00:02:06,570
We've got this one locked up.

82
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:08,911
Don't pull it up.

83
00:02:08,911 --> 00:02:09,630
Nobody wants to,

84
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:10,920
I don't want to watch God blow a guy.

85
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:13,080
I'm proud to say I was
on one of these sites.

86
00:02:13,081 --> 00:02:14,160
You have a day and yeah,

87
00:02:14,161 --> 00:02:15,210
I don't know if anybody else does.

88
00:02:15,211 --> 00:02:18,390
It's where you'll PDR periodically
check in to make sure you're not gay.

89
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:22,860
I feel like 10 seconds of
male porn and just go like,

90
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:23,341
nope,

91
00:02:23,341 --> 00:02:24,174
still not good.

92
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:24,841
I'm still,

93
00:02:24,841 --> 00:02:25,621
as of last week,

94
00:02:25,621 --> 00:02:26,520
I'm still not good.

95
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:28,110
I think I'm out of the woods.

96
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:30,570
You don't want me to do it
officially out of the woods.

97
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:32,520
Do you remember the old
Kinison bit about that?

98
00:02:32,521 --> 00:02:33,140
It was a,

99
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:33,973
he's like a

100
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:36,363
fantasy,

101
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:38,430
so I'm sitting around
the house the other day.

102
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:41,300
Cause if there's one,

103
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:46,343
yeah,

104
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:49,080
I didn't like the idea of a guy.

105
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:49,441
There was,

106
00:02:49,441 --> 00:02:49,971
I think it got,

107
00:02:49,971 --> 00:02:50,401
was blown.

108
00:02:50,401 --> 00:02:51,190
Another guy.

109
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:51,780
Stubble.

110
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:52,510
That's what Bob,

111
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:53,570
just like stubble

112
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,960
stubble anywhere near my precious.

113
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:58,171
Well,

114
00:02:58,171 --> 00:03:01,640
men are crazy and they're violent and uh,

115
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,400
there are also that way if they're gay,

116
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:04,400
straight man,

117
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,660
crazy and violent and straight
straight men and gay men.

118
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:07,901
They're,

119
00:03:07,901 --> 00:03:09,820
the only difference is
one of them likes boys.

120
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:10,181
Okay.

121
00:03:10,181 --> 00:03:13,630
So the idea of that being hot and sexy,

122
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:14,090
uh,

123
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:14,690
a car,

124
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:17,020
it's like getting blown by
crazy chimp and you know,

125
00:03:17,021 --> 00:03:17,920
I don't trust dudes.

126
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:20,650
Some Studley muscular
dude who suck on my Dick.

127
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:21,191
Exactly.

128
00:03:21,191 --> 00:03:22,660
Just rip it off and throw it away and go,

129
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:23,880
ha ha.

130
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:26,180
I like how you went a
little crazy on the ha.

131
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:26,511
Yeah.

132
00:03:26,511 --> 00:03:27,730
A big muscular guy going,

133
00:03:27,731 --> 00:03:28,564
hey

134
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:30,940
Harry.

135
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:31,601
Harry chess.

136
00:03:31,601 --> 00:03:32,470
Perfectly Harry.

137
00:03:32,471 --> 00:03:33,041
Not Too much.

138
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:35,260
It's trims it a lot to grow out a little,

139
00:03:35,261 --> 00:03:35,850
but it doesn't get,

140
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:36,910
doesn't get unkempt.

141
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:37,811
Yeah,

142
00:03:37,811 --> 00:03:38,430
they,

143
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:39,940
they're having a good time over there.

144
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:41,420
I gotta say the gays,

145
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:44,980
the gays have a weird life because
if it wasn't for the persecution,

146
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:46,150
it's pretty God damn sweet.

147
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:47,470
If you think about it,

148
00:03:47,471 --> 00:03:49,510
like if we all men and women,

149
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:50,373
okay.

150
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,080
And this is coming from a guy who
has kids and loves having kids.

151
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:54,070
However,

152
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:57,700
there's a weirdness to having sex with
men and women because it can possibly

153
00:03:57,701 --> 00:03:58,780
result in a child.

154
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:01,390
That weirdness is
eliminated with gay people.

155
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:03,250
It's just fucking,

156
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,050
and there's no Yang.

157
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:07,180
It's all Yin or Yang.

158
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:07,960
No Yen,

159
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:08,500
one of those,

160
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,670
whichever it is a hard one.

161
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:10,390
There's that.

162
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:10,541
Well,

163
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:11,980
there is a bit of a Yemeni,

164
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,180
there's,

165
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:15,220
there's a little bit of
that as a bottom top issue,

166
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:15,560
but yeah,

167
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:19,300
but there's what the issue isn't what
a man wants versus what a woman wants.

168
00:04:19,301 --> 00:04:20,440
They're both men.

169
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:24,340
So the weirdness like the
trying to figure out women,

170
00:04:24,341 --> 00:04:25,510
especially like when you're young,

171
00:04:25,511 --> 00:04:28,900
one of the weirdest things is just the
idea of trying to think the way a woman

172
00:04:28,901 --> 00:04:30,910
things you think the way a guy thinks,

173
00:04:30,911 --> 00:04:32,140
you think everything's going to be fine.

174
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:36,760
And like I remember when I was young and
I just started dating when I was like a

175
00:04:36,761 --> 00:04:37,300
teenager.

176
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:40,360
I would talk to girls the way I would
talk to my friends and they would get

177
00:04:40,361 --> 00:04:43,530
upset and they would think
you're crazy and can't do it.

178
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,120
You cannot change your
language completely.

179
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:47,320
Change your language,

180
00:04:47,321 --> 00:04:48,460
change your approach,

181
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:52,030
change the way you guys can fuck around
with each other and we assume that we're

182
00:04:52,031 --> 00:04:54,160
gonna like laugh and fuck
around with each other back.

183
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:55,061
And that's what we did.

184
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:57,810
We insult each other halfass constantly.

185
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:01,330
You don't have that Irish
fucking vengeance thing,

186
00:05:01,331 --> 00:05:01,810
huh?

187
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:02,381
No,

188
00:05:02,381 --> 00:05:02,591
I,

189
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:05,050
well if I did when I was young,

190
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,870
I eliminated it at all with thinking.

191
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:13,380
And you know that I've argued.

192
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:14,620
Do you argue with people in your head?

193
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,750
I don't allow myself to
do an immune that anymore.

194
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:17,613
I used to do that.

195
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:18,940
I used to do that when I was a young man.

196
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:19,803
I used to,

197
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,710
if I was a young man,

198
00:05:20,711 --> 00:05:21,341
I've got an argument,

199
00:05:21,341 --> 00:05:21,820
someone,

200
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:26,820
I would relive that argument like every
day for like 10 minutes for like a year.

201
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:28,600
Maybe I'll come back to it a year later.

202
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:29,650
It's fucking God,

203
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:30,250
I should have told that.

204
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:31,083
Fuck God.

205
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:32,920
Fuck you mister.

206
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:34,150
You have to like go through your notes.

207
00:05:34,151 --> 00:05:35,140
Like what was I gonna say to him?

208
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:35,681
Oh yeah,

209
00:05:35,681 --> 00:05:37,850
I was going to say that I used
to talk about this on stage.

210
00:05:37,851 --> 00:05:38,684
This is totally true.

211
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:39,440
When I was a,

212
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,750
I guess I was like 26,

213
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:41,681
I live,

214
00:05:41,681 --> 00:05:45,250
I was living in Encino and I rented this
house and it had an orange tree in the

215
00:05:45,251 --> 00:05:47,020
front yard and I didn't pay my bills.

216
00:05:47,021 --> 00:05:47,950
It's very irresponsible.

217
00:05:47,951 --> 00:05:48,940
So this guy came over,

218
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:49,300
uh,

219
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:52,960
I turned the power back on and the guy
came over to turn the power on and it

220
00:05:52,961 --> 00:05:53,920
seemed like a nice guy said,

221
00:05:53,921 --> 00:05:54,360
hey man,

222
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:54,490
uh,

223
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:55,570
those oranges a delicious,

224
00:05:55,571 --> 00:05:56,560
if you want me to go grab one.

225
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:57,591
And he goes,

226
00:05:57,591 --> 00:05:57,891
okay,

227
00:05:57,891 --> 00:05:58,370
thanks.

228
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:02,990
So the guy took nine fucking oranges
and I sat there watching them.

229
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:03,201
Like,

230
00:06:03,201 --> 00:06:05,810
this mother fucker is taken more orange.

231
00:06:05,811 --> 00:06:07,280
I can't believe this shit.

232
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:09,200
And to this day,

233
00:06:09,201 --> 00:06:09,680
man,

234
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,230
I have to fight off the urge.

235
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:11,511
No,

236
00:06:11,511 --> 00:06:11,721
no,

237
00:06:11,721 --> 00:06:11,871
no,

238
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:12,051
no,

239
00:06:12,051 --> 00:06:12,211
no.

240
00:06:12,211 --> 00:06:13,044
It's not that story.

241
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:13,933
Three times.

242
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:14,510
It's real.

243
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:15,760
Like I was an asshole for,

244
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:19,490
to this day I'll be in my car
and I'm driving down the street.

245
00:06:19,491 --> 00:06:21,790
And I just go nine fucking oranges do.

246
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:22,790
Really?

247
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:27,790
That was 1993 did I tell you the story
that the loan told me that I tell it on

248
00:06:29,871 --> 00:06:30,561
this podcast?

249
00:06:30,561 --> 00:06:31,394
No.

250
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:33,171
Shit.

251
00:06:33,171 --> 00:06:34,190
Like this never happens.

252
00:06:34,191 --> 00:06:37,580
Me and pivot one time flew to,

253
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:42,700
we're going to fight to a Mayweather
fight and we get on the plane and fucking

254
00:06:44,031 --> 00:06:45,090
Stallone is waiting.

255
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:47,443
Come on in.

256
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,673
Alright.

257
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:50,770
I guess we're going to
a fight with Stallone.

258
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:52,180
Great thing about Stallone.

259
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,250
He knows what his good stories,

260
00:06:54,251 --> 00:06:54,880
ours.

261
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,061
He,

262
00:06:55,061 --> 00:06:55,511
you know what I mean?

263
00:06:55,511 --> 00:06:57,490
He like knows what people
want to hear about.

264
00:06:57,491 --> 00:06:58,570
They want to hear about rocky.

265
00:06:58,810 --> 00:06:59,830
They wanna hear about fucking,

266
00:06:59,831 --> 00:07:00,341
they want to hear what,

267
00:07:00,341 --> 00:07:04,390
so he's talking about he was
directing the movie staying alive.

268
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:05,320
Oh,

269
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:05,760
uh,

270
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,040
yeah,

271
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:06,730
I remember that.

272
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:07,031
He was,

273
00:07:07,031 --> 00:07:08,500
and it was a Travolta movie that,

274
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,810
that Frank Stallone's
sang on the soundtrack.

275
00:07:10,811 --> 00:07:11,644
That is correct.

276
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:12,910
Um,

277
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:15,220
so yes.

278
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:17,900
So Stallone said that he,

279
00:07:17,901 --> 00:07:18,734
he goes,

280
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:19,331
he goes.

281
00:07:19,331 --> 00:07:20,020
So I,

282
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:24,460
I called John Up to the house
for a meeting about that song,

283
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:25,820
play that song while the story is going,

284
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,260
he goes alone.

285
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:28,240
This is the end.

286
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:28,931
I think it's called,

287
00:07:28,931 --> 00:07:32,200
this is the end and
staying alive soundtrack.

288
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:33,040
He goes,

289
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:33,431
he goes.

290
00:07:33,431 --> 00:07:35,260
So John came up and he goes,

291
00:07:35,261 --> 00:07:38,040
John's got a real food issue
that people don't know.

292
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:39,363
And he goes,

293
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:40,541
he goes,

294
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:41,351
John comes up,

295
00:07:41,351 --> 00:07:42,520
we're sitting at a table and he goes,

296
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:43,121
now,

297
00:07:43,121 --> 00:07:47,800
my wife had made some
homemade fudge that day.

298
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:49,720
So we sit at the table,

299
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:54,990
my wife puts out some fudge Travolta
proceeds to eat the entire plate of food.

300
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:57,180
Oh yeah,

301
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:58,630
this fucking guy obey.

302
00:07:59,200 --> 00:07:59,531
He goes,

303
00:07:59,531 --> 00:08:00,850
which first of all,

304
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:02,290
his fucking route,

305
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:05,350
which is fucking made
me laugh my head off.

306
00:08:05,351 --> 00:08:06,370
And that was like that.

307
00:08:06,371 --> 00:08:07,750
He hasn't forgotten that he,

308
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:10,500
that's his orange story is that,

309
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:11,040
is that,

310
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:11,860
um,

311
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:13,060
is that it was fucking rude.

312
00:08:13,061 --> 00:08:14,680
That's still alone or that a turmoil.

313
00:08:14,681 --> 00:08:14,891
Tate,

314
00:08:14,891 --> 00:08:15,430
all of us.

315
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:15,611
Well,

316
00:08:15,611 --> 00:08:19,000
he's hanging on to some shit
from the early eighties right?

317
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:21,100
One was staying alive.

318
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,210
That was 82.

319
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,910
Remember when he's walking
down the streets in New
York City with a fucking fur

320
00:08:24,911 --> 00:08:26,680
coat on and it got bumps into him.

321
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:28,850
Travolta bumps in on like Stallone,

322
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:30,400
you really remember this movie?

323
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:31,480
Now this is the wrong song.

324
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:32,430
Is that it?

325
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:32,940
Yeah.

326
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:33,773
What does it say?

327
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:35,040
It's call it far from over.

328
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:35,691
Oh yeah.

329
00:08:35,691 --> 00:08:35,941
Yeah.

330
00:08:35,941 --> 00:08:37,230
This is a great spot.

331
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:38,093
Strong.

332
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:38,940
Okay.

333
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:39,460
Change.

334
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:39,611
Yeah.

335
00:08:39,611 --> 00:08:40,444
This is it.

336
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,620
This is frank.

337
00:08:43,621 --> 00:08:45,460
Stallone's stuff still owns brother.

338
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:52,230
This fucking song was
the shit back in the day.

339
00:08:52,231 --> 00:08:53,730
I wish I knew how to dance song.

340
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:55,020
I'm downloading this,

341
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:56,150
not even fucking around and say,

342
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:57,150
I forgot about this.

343
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,980
I wish I knew how to dance back then.

344
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,810
I want it to be a part of this world.

345
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:05,310
I wanted to be the impressive guy on the
dance floor are spinning around and in

346
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:06,240
a perfect position.

347
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:09,930
It's still only said that
they were shooting flashdance
next door and he's like,

348
00:09:09,931 --> 00:09:13,140
and we knew that that was going to
be the one John Travolta met a single

349
00:09:13,141 --> 00:09:13,651
handedly,

350
00:09:13,651 --> 00:09:18,510
made more men gay just from this music
and from singing and dancing and getting

351
00:09:18,511 --> 00:09:19,344
people to dance.

352
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:20,500
He probably purse.

353
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:23,010
That was probably his total overall goal,

354
00:09:23,011 --> 00:09:27,210
which is to say nothing of his bath
house work just or the Shah's power work,

355
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:31,850
but just to be able to dance so good
and make dancing fucking dancing.

356
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,570
It's not the Fred Astaire days.

357
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,960
This is a new era of
manliness we get from you.

358
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,631
You were,

359
00:09:36,631 --> 00:09:38,740
did you ever go to like a disco or,

360
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:39,001
yeah,

361
00:09:39,001 --> 00:09:40,260
I did that of course.

362
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:41,850
So how would you want to get laid?

363
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:43,770
We went to just around with a sign.

364
00:09:43,771 --> 00:09:47,040
Please fuck me and lay you fucking
getting it out there now Brandon out there

365
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:47,660
and you did it,

366
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:47,940
dude.

367
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:51,510
I had caviar Ricci pants that they were
tight on the top and they ballooned out

368
00:09:51,511 --> 00:09:52,570
like Mc Hammer peasy.

369
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:54,870
It was all in my chest and I
went on stage with those ones.

370
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,680
It's a disaster.

371
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,340
Look at him,

372
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:59,130
but he made dancing a manly
thing that was attractive.

373
00:09:59,250 --> 00:09:59,490
Okay.

374
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:03,180
This is one of the gayest things you
could see a man do ever look at that.

375
00:10:03,181 --> 00:10:04,330
Back that up for two seconds.

376
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:06,750
I want to show you what those guys
are doing here on the hand job.

377
00:10:06,751 --> 00:10:07,540
You know what they're doing.

378
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:08,220
Know they're doing.

379
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:10,780
They're pretending they're
near a million dick here.

380
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:11,410
I'll play it.

381
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:12,243
This shit.

382
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:13,420
You suck at Youtube.

383
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,800
Now this youtube sucks.

384
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:16,003
Does it?

385
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:17,741
Well,

386
00:10:17,741 --> 00:10:18,331
this is the,

387
00:10:18,331 --> 00:10:18,800
uh,

388
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:23,800
the standard compilation that you had
to have in those old school movies.

389
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:28,810
You to have this series of
scenes where you see him failing,

390
00:10:28,811 --> 00:10:29,321
failing,

391
00:10:29,321 --> 00:10:30,154
failing,

392
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:33,070
and then practicing really
hard on this dancing.

393
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:33,880
See,

394
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,290
he's waiting tables,

395
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:36,753
frustrated,

396
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:37,870
but when it gets out there,

397
00:10:37,871 --> 00:10:38,704
back home

398
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:41,760
doesn't waiver me.

399
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,730
I got to use a phone.

400
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:43,470
I need the phone.

401
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:43,730
Everybody.

402
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:45,570
What is this

403
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:48,483
damn mud?

404
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:49,121
Yes.

405
00:10:49,121 --> 00:10:50,260
You're going to get to be gay.

406
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:51,880
Come dance.

407
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:52,391
Yes,

408
00:10:52,391 --> 00:10:53,380
I can dance.

409
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,233
Look at this,

410
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:56,530
those movement.

411
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,910
Look at that thing with the toes.

412
00:10:58,030 --> 00:10:59,560
Whenever you point your toes like that,

413
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,880
you're begging for deck.

414
00:11:00,881 --> 00:11:01,060
New.

415
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:01,380
Literal.

416
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:01,601
Yeah,

417
00:11:01,601 --> 00:11:01,961
man.

418
00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:02,830
You're pointing your toes.

419
00:11:02,831 --> 00:11:03,664
A cry for help.

420
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:04,600
You're begging for it.

421
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:05,950
It's not in the wrong with Pega for deck.

422
00:11:05,951 --> 00:11:06,784
Don't get me wrong.

423
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:08,770
Nothing wrong with being gay to,

424
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:10,310
to volt is a bad motherfucker.

425
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:10,861
See that?

426
00:11:10,861 --> 00:11:12,610
See that you've got to be
turned off for dark off.

427
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:13,563
Those are decks.

428
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:14,560
That's a hundred decks.

429
00:11:14,561 --> 00:11:15,520
Hundred percent this is that.

430
00:11:15,521 --> 00:11:19,330
It's just gimme a dik dik dik dik dik
dik she be moving your fist towards your

431
00:11:19,331 --> 00:11:19,631
face.

432
00:11:19,631 --> 00:11:20,890
He trying to hit yourself in the face.

433
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:25,420
It's clearly not an outward move where
the retraction is just bringing it back

434
00:11:25,421 --> 00:11:25,961
to position.

435
00:11:25,961 --> 00:11:27,340
Now they're pulling down.

436
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,960
That's pulling Dick's into your mouth.

437
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,040
Yeah.

438
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:30,550
I told him,

439
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:30,791
look,

440
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:31,270
I totally,

441
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:32,103
I saw it.

442
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:33,730
I saw it.

443
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:35,530
Nothing wrong with that to
another testament to the,

444
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:37,180
to the gays are having a blast.

445
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:37,870
Yes.

446
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:39,060
They're having more fun for sure.

447
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:41,170
Sure works by kind of having a blast.

448
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:41,551
You know what?

449
00:11:41,551 --> 00:11:42,610
The gays are not having fun.

450
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:44,860
The ones who fuck up and adopt kids,

451
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:45,731
they start thinking,

452
00:11:45,731 --> 00:11:47,080
I'm going to be like a family.

453
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:47,800
We're going to get there.

454
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:48,401
We're going to get married.

455
00:11:48,401 --> 00:11:49,021
We'd adopt kids.

456
00:11:49,021 --> 00:11:49,854
And I'm like,

457
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:51,940
what does a lot of fucking work?

458
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:54,070
You realize they had the key.

459
00:11:54,071 --> 00:11:54,460
They were,

460
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:57,580
they're winning the race and nobody
had the baby out of their body.

461
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,391
Neither one of them.

462
00:11:58,391 --> 00:12:00,520
So they're both standing there
with this little motherfucker.

463
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,230
It's causing all sorts of problems.

464
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:03,761
Damn,

465
00:12:03,761 --> 00:12:05,470
I fucked up the whole big gay party.

466
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,380
Is this another gate?

467
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:07,110
What are you doing here?

468
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:07,380
Okay.

469
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:08,170
She's,

470
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:08,920
she's acting.

471
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,180
She's talking about her baby.

472
00:12:10,181 --> 00:12:12,160
Like you know how you were
just saying the Dixon mouth.

473
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:16,090
This is a news reporter saying how she
used to take her a electric toothbrush

474
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:17,800
and to help her kids gums,

475
00:12:17,801 --> 00:12:20,110
but she did it on air
and it just completely

476
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:22,690
keep the music plan.

477
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:28,790
[inaudible] let me get here.

478
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:30,330
That's two Dixie.

479
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:34,190
She's docking decks and
then she's tasting them.

480
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:36,370
Gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme them.

481
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:36,771
Oh,

482
00:12:36,771 --> 00:12:37,840
I'm going to sneeze when you dick.

483
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:42,350
It's delicious.

484
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,053
Yeah.

485
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:46,820
It's funny that you're not supposed to
ever think of those people being sexual.

486
00:12:46,821 --> 00:12:49,010
Like if she actually did do
that and start it with like,

487
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:49,671
like,

488
00:12:49,671 --> 00:12:50,241
oh yeah,

489
00:12:50,241 --> 00:12:51,200
I fucking believe this car,

490
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:52,043
a home loan.

491
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:53,510
I think that's the fun,

492
00:12:53,511 --> 00:12:57,770
one of the fun parts about having sex
with women is how different it is from

493
00:12:57,771 --> 00:12:58,940
what they're normally like.

494
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:01,430
Cause you and I are eight or 10 seconds.

495
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:06,440
I can imagine you fucking within eight
seconds of right now someone wants to

496
00:13:06,441 --> 00:13:07,700
fuck and he's really close to me.

497
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:08,773
I know what you're doing.

498
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:13,160
Girls got fucking jewelry
on and her decorum.

499
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:13,911
I see what you're saying,

500
00:13:13,911 --> 00:13:14,150
like,

501
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:17,330
and then the difference between like a
girl and real life and a girl getting

502
00:13:17,331 --> 00:13:22,331
fucked or fucking is so fast and
it's so awesome and so exciting.

503
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:28,490
You mean talking dirty and they want
some dinner fucking sweating and they

504
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:32,150
fucking legs or splits the best
picture near Predator fucking now.

505
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:32,790
Yeah.

506
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:33,623
I can't help it.

507
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:35,360
You're so clever.

508
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,193
I see what you've done.

509
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:37,940
Both of you together should,

510
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,290
he should get together and try.

511
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:43,610
Please got together a video.

512
00:13:43,611 --> 00:13:44,750
You should really check out.

513
00:13:44,751 --> 00:13:45,200
Joe.

514
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:48,500
I'm going to get you to think about a guy
sucking a guy's Dick and I'm gonna get

515
00:13:48,501 --> 00:13:49,131
you to watch it.

516
00:13:49,131 --> 00:13:50,000
And then you're like,

517
00:13:50,001 --> 00:13:51,380
I want you to think about me having sex,

518
00:13:51,381 --> 00:13:52,730
so I see what you both have done.

519
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,553
How dare you?

520
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:55,451
How dare bolt.

521
00:13:55,451 --> 00:13:58,490
Some comic was telling me
that when he'd go on the road,

522
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:01,760
him and his buddies who were
staying at the hotel together,

523
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,630
they knew that they were going to try
to bring girls back to the hotel room

524
00:14:05,631 --> 00:14:06,464
afterward.

525
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:07,443
Uh,

526
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:09,660
and they wanted the girls to
not be wearing a lot of close,

527
00:14:09,661 --> 00:14:13,070
so they would turn the heat up as
high as they could and the hotel.

528
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:14,690
How weird is that?

529
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:16,830
How dumb does that all make?

530
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:19,950
Girls are in a hotel room.

531
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:21,290
They'll get Nicky.

532
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:22,730
Next thing I know we're fucking,

533
00:14:22,731 --> 00:14:23,810
because you know how that goes.

534
00:14:23,811 --> 00:14:23,960
Yeah.

535
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,580
When people get really hot and lethargic,

536
00:14:25,581 --> 00:14:27,180
that's when they're the
best investment they want.

537
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:30,400
It can't stop thinking about when
you're about to dehydrate you about the

538
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:31,220
blackout,

539
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:32,780
that's when you really want to throw down.

540
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:33,793
Yeah.

541
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,390
Just to bring a lot of water.

542
00:14:35,391 --> 00:14:36,710
Give them water and they'll fuck you.

543
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:38,810
Are you add and Ami right now?

544
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:41,360
Checking on right there.

545
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:44,330
I want to check in saying
that's what I'm saying.

546
00:14:44,331 --> 00:14:44,901
Don't do that.

547
00:14:44,901 --> 00:14:46,170
Put that fucking phone man.

548
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:47,023
You can interrupt.

549
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:47,751
Donate it.

550
00:14:47,751 --> 00:14:49,400
The flow of the
conversation is interrupted.

551
00:14:49,401 --> 00:14:50,760
If you left those fucks in your mind.

552
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:51,531
Thought you were.

553
00:14:51,531 --> 00:14:52,550
I felt like the flow.

554
00:14:52,551 --> 00:14:55,910
I felt like you were
putting a dam up a damn.

555
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:57,480
I thought you were fucking beavering.

556
00:14:57,970 --> 00:15:01,000
You don't want to think about you fucking
or I don't want this one did walk.

557
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,510
The work flow was going,

558
00:15:02,511 --> 00:15:03,400
Joe wasn't,

559
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:04,243
I got news for you.

560
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:05,450
That's where it was headed.

561
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:07,610
It was there already going there.

562
00:15:07,611 --> 00:15:08,444
It was already there.

563
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,473
Hmm.

564
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:13,700
Brian's got videos of bears
making out for no reason.

565
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,073
Yeah.

566
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:25,900
Okay.
