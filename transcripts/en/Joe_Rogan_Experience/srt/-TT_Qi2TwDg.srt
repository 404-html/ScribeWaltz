1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,650
The joe rogan experience,

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:05,090
like one of the first guys to
go for the fucked up laugh,

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:06,900
like in the personal conversation,

4
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:08,940
like you just sitting there hanging out,

5
00:00:08,941 --> 00:00:09,774
eating lunch,

6
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:10,643
and then you just,

7
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:11,970
you'll go for the,

8
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,280
but you don't mean that
you're a really nice guy.

9
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:14,930
You know,

10
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:19,930
like I don't think people who aren't
either immersed in the world of standup

11
00:00:20,191 --> 00:00:21,840
comedy or know a lot of standup comics,

12
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:23,760
I don't think they appreciate that.

13
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:24,613
Right.

14
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:25,531
Yeah.

15
00:00:25,531 --> 00:00:27,000
I think that to me it's about,

16
00:00:27,001 --> 00:00:27,631
it's a gear.

17
00:00:27,631 --> 00:00:29,880
You're commenting on normal conversation.

18
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:30,181
You're,

19
00:00:30,181 --> 00:00:30,451
you're,

20
00:00:30,451 --> 00:00:30,780
you're,

21
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:34,620
you're making fun of what a
racist would say it and see.

22
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:35,540
Exactly.

23
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:36,020
You know,

24
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:40,860
and you're being racist to also being
racist against was we are racist,

25
00:00:40,861 --> 00:00:41,281
are we,

26
00:00:41,281 --> 00:00:42,210
this is what we are.

27
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:42,870
Okay.

28
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:44,490
We are judgmental.

29
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:45,960
It's part of evolution.

30
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:47,750
We're constantly assessing our,

31
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:48,803
our environment.

32
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:52,380
And sometimes we know the shit
you're not supposed to say.

33
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:56,280
So we say it because it's funny and it's
also funny because there's some truth

34
00:00:56,281 --> 00:00:56,670
to it,

35
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:56,881
right?

36
00:00:56,881 --> 00:00:57,810
And it's fucked up.

37
00:00:57,870 --> 00:00:58,860
There's some truth to it.

38
00:00:58,980 --> 00:00:59,551
And God,

39
00:00:59,551 --> 00:01:00,930
I wish it wasn't true.

40
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,820
I wish stereotypes weren't true.

41
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:03,090
Right.

42
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:03,930
We should talions.

43
00:01:03,931 --> 00:01:06,660
I wish my own relatives were an apes.

44
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,270
I really wished they weren't savage,

45
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:11,280
untrustworthy apes,

46
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:12,990
but they are.

47
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,270
That's what they have to watch.

48
00:01:15,271 --> 00:01:19,530
Fucking real housewives of New Jersey
and we've see it's in that Italians.

49
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:20,670
We see my people,

50
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:22,920
my people are savages.

51
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:24,330
I wish that wasn't true,

52
00:01:24,331 --> 00:01:25,440
but it's fucking true.

53
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:25,771
Yeah,

54
00:01:25,771 --> 00:01:26,401
it's hard to,

55
00:01:26,401 --> 00:01:30,150
it's hard to fight against the Italian
stereotype because here's the problem

56
00:01:30,151 --> 00:01:34,620
with Italians that there's many is that
you're in Nabard with the fact that

57
00:01:34,621 --> 00:01:35,251
you're Italian.

58
00:01:35,251 --> 00:01:35,421
See,

59
00:01:35,421 --> 00:01:36,510
you won't evolve.

60
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,160
Like every Italian guy.

61
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:42,600
You could meet some guy from fucking
the prairie prairie land Midwest,

62
00:01:42,601 --> 00:01:43,590
and if he's Italian,

63
00:01:43,591 --> 00:01:48,480
he'll go and get the pasta fuzzy because
they've watched the godfather and

64
00:01:48,481 --> 00:01:52,590
they've watched sopranos and they want
to sound like them because they want to

65
00:01:52,591 --> 00:01:53,460
be Italian.

66
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:56,190
Whereas we're supposed to
be all growing away from,

67
00:01:56,191 --> 00:01:57,024
like you're saying,

68
00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:00,570
the barbaric versions of
ourselves should be in the past,

69
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,700
not perpetuated for generations.

70
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,680
I have friends that are back east friends.

71
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:07,380
I love him to death and I
don't mind when they put it on.

72
00:02:07,381 --> 00:02:08,211
I don't mind when they,

73
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:08,730
the AA.

74
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:09,750
Do the Italian talk,

75
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,220
a little piece of me dies.

76
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:11,491
Right,

77
00:02:11,491 --> 00:02:11,791
right,

78
00:02:11,791 --> 00:02:12,624
right.

79
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:13,703
I'm Irish.

80
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:16,723
Hey,

81
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:17,401
hey,

82
00:02:17,401 --> 00:02:21,600
your mom is still making it goes
goose Sheppey some of the comedy.

83
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:22,140
Giuseppe.

84
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:22,973
That's a big one.

85
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:24,130
Hey Giuseppe.

86
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:28,470
Very rare that that my Jewish friends
call me Giuseppe if it might be already

87
00:02:28,471 --> 00:02:29,011
when he was high,

88
00:02:29,011 --> 00:02:32,040
but that's never seen an
Italian guy have a solo fight.

89
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:34,680
It's always a fucking group jumps in.

90
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:35,791
Well,

91
00:02:35,791 --> 00:02:39,750
there's a herd mentality involved and
being proud of what patch of dirt you're

92
00:02:39,751 --> 00:02:40,021
on.

93
00:02:40,021 --> 00:02:40,380
Right.

94
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:42,150
That doesn't lend itself to courage.

95
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:42,780
Yes.

96
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:43,440
That's not the,

97
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,790
that's not the right mentality.

98
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:48,000
That's got the the rugged individual
that takes on the group and wins.

99
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:48,751
No,

100
00:02:48,751 --> 00:02:50,490
that's a fucking Bob.

101
00:02:50,491 --> 00:02:51,500
You believe what this guy saying?

102
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:51,591
Oh,

103
00:02:51,591 --> 00:02:53,000
it's Bobby.

104
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:57,450
Bobby's Bobby's wearing
a wire the entire time.

105
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:57,941
Bob.

106
00:02:57,941 --> 00:03:00,130
He's in the of the patrol car.

107
00:03:00,131 --> 00:03:01,540
I was waiting to testify.

108
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,520
What the fuck Bobby with family over here.

109
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:07,210
Let this fucking shit go between us.

110
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:10,240
I was wondering why we call you to rat

111
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:17,490
and he was with Bobby to
rat fucking cock sucker.

112
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:17,950
No,

113
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:19,640
he used to sit on my Mama's day.

114
00:03:19,641 --> 00:03:20,500
Oblique Gaga.

115
00:03:20,501 --> 00:03:21,600
Gulu shy.

116
00:03:21,601 --> 00:03:22,241
I think about it.

117
00:03:22,241 --> 00:03:22,571
What is,

118
00:03:22,571 --> 00:03:25,720
who's the number one most
famous gangsters of all time?

119
00:03:25,721 --> 00:03:26,680
They're all Italian guys.

120
00:03:26,681 --> 00:03:29,530
They'll braggadocious
Gotti types or Al Capone.

121
00:03:29,531 --> 00:03:31,150
I've got bone over here.

122
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:32,110
Jimmy Hoffa,

123
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:34,150
savages.

124
00:03:34,151 --> 00:03:36,130
My people are criminal savages.

125
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,620
They make awesome food
and know how to fuck.

126
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:39,990
That's it.

127
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:40,430
That's it.

128
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:41,080
As girls.

129
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:41,950
Oh my God.

130
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:42,721
And your good luck.

131
00:03:42,721 --> 00:03:47,050
I mean girl hot Italian girl hottest who
can make really good food and likes to

132
00:03:47,051 --> 00:03:47,630
fuck all the time.

133
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:49,690
She might beat you to death in your sleep.

134
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:50,350
Right?

135
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:50,981
And you don't mind.

136
00:03:50,981 --> 00:03:51,760
It's worth it.

137
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,140
That's fucking crazy.

138
00:03:53,141 --> 00:03:53,471
The cray.

139
00:03:53,471 --> 00:03:53,660
This.

140
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:54,550
I love Italian church.

141
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,630
I grew up around dark,

142
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:58,480
dark Italian check I
gave up on him last time.

143
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,650
Trigger Dude's like swing at me.

144
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:00,370
Rarely.

145
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:00,880
Yeah,

146
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,740
back in the back of the Boston days.

147
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:03,110
Right?

148
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:03,943
Like that's it.

149
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,833
I'm good.

150
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,420
I'm good.

151
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:07,990
Can't date anybody like
me fucking animals.

152
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:08,951
Well that's it too.

153
00:04:08,951 --> 00:04:10,690
You're not supposed to
date within your own race.

154
00:04:10,691 --> 00:04:11,411
That's proven.

155
00:04:11,411 --> 00:04:12,244
I married,

156
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:13,660
well actually she's half Irish,

157
00:04:13,661 --> 00:04:14,231
half Jewish,

158
00:04:14,231 --> 00:04:15,064
but you got to,

159
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:16,690
you got to get a little way from mom.

160
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:18,310
It's a,

161
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:21,460
well the Irish were the most racist of
all people because we're the fairest

162
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:21,791
skin.

163
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:22,840
We look down on everybody.

164
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:24,063
I don't think so.

165
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,250
Oh fuck man.

166
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:29,500
So really we came to America at the time
when the Italians came at basically the

167
00:04:29,501 --> 00:04:30,310
same time.

168
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:32,800
So when you go to the Bronx or Boston,

169
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:33,960
there's so race week,

170
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:37,300
they fucking hate each other and they
hate everybody else because we were the

171
00:04:37,301 --> 00:04:38,470
last ones to come over.

172
00:04:38,471 --> 00:04:39,970
So everybody hated us.

173
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:42,220
We were the last ones to get jobs.

174
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,720
So we have to like the Irish
were the last of the mean.

175
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:45,241
That's why we were,

176
00:04:45,241 --> 00:04:47,560
is that first the first immigrants,

177
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:48,040
English,

178
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:48,730
the Dutch,

179
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:48,971
Dutch,

180
00:04:48,971 --> 00:04:49,804
English,

181
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:50,430
Dutch,

182
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:51,070
English,

183
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:53,910
the Scandinavians.

184
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:57,340
I know so little about the immigration
of different cultures in this country.

185
00:04:57,370 --> 00:04:58,840
Always know about my own family,

186
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:00,180
which was the great depression.

187
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:02,260
My grandparents came over
during the depression.

188
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:02,800
Yeah,

189
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,640
there's a great book about Cornelius
Vanderbilt and it kind of tracks New York

190
00:05:06,641 --> 00:05:07,570
in the 18 hundreds.

191
00:05:07,571 --> 00:05:10,090
And as the waves of people came over and,

192
00:05:10,091 --> 00:05:10,271
uh,

193
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:14,980
it's really won the Pulitzer
prize called the first tycoon.

194
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:16,030
My Grandmother,

195
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:16,780
the last tycoon,

196
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:18,610
my grandmother grew up in the depression.

197
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,590
She was kind of insane because of it.

198
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:23,470
And she used to like hide
things all around the house.

199
00:05:23,471 --> 00:05:26,470
Like she hide money in
various spots in the house.

200
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:28,120
They didn't find it until after she died.

201
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:28,811
They went,

202
00:05:28,811 --> 00:05:29,200
Shit,

203
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:29,770
did she hide?

204
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:29,921
Oh,

205
00:05:29,921 --> 00:05:32,380
she had thousands of dollars walls.

206
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:33,400
But it's just,

207
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,620
but the idea was not
just that she had money.

208
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:36,401
I mean she,

209
00:05:36,401 --> 00:05:37,360
they were very poor.

210
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:37,870
Yeah.

211
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:42,870
But that she had money that
she had squirreled away in
to these weird spots all

212
00:05:43,511 --> 00:05:44,380
over their house.

213
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:45,910
It was really weird.

214
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:47,630
I did you almost not find it before you,

215
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:47,831
well,

216
00:05:47,831 --> 00:05:49,000
I didn't have anything to do with it.

217
00:05:49,001 --> 00:05:49,451
His,

218
00:05:49,451 --> 00:05:51,370
his children did the,

219
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:51,840
uh,

220
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:52,590
the,

221
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:52,910
my,

222
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:54,070
when my grandfather died,

223
00:05:54,071 --> 00:05:56,290
I was over here and I
think that's when they,

224
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:57,650
they started searching the house.

225
00:05:57,651 --> 00:05:59,120
The people that were living in New Jersey,

226
00:05:59,330 --> 00:05:59,781
they had it.

227
00:05:59,781 --> 00:06:01,940
They had some idea that she was like,

228
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:02,180
Shit.

229
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:02,600
Oh No,

230
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:02,751
no,

231
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:03,521
they didn't know me.

232
00:06:03,521 --> 00:06:03,721
She,

233
00:06:03,721 --> 00:06:04,670
she had this,

234
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:08,630
she had had an aneurysm and she was
sick for a long time because of it.

235
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:09,943
And um,

236
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:10,551
during that time,

237
00:06:10,551 --> 00:06:12,890
my grandfather took care of her and
my grandfather took care of her.

238
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:14,090
That's when I was staying with him.

239
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:17,690
And it was a very fascinating
time in my life because,

240
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:18,500
um,

241
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:21,590
I had left Boston and I
had moved to New York,

242
00:06:21,591 --> 00:06:23,660
but I couldn't really
afford to live in New York.

243
00:06:23,661 --> 00:06:25,250
I didn't know I had hardly any money.

244
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:26,900
So I stated my grandfather,

245
00:06:26,901 --> 00:06:28,820
who was living on North Ninth Street,

246
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:31,220
which was a really bad
neighborhood in Newark,

247
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:32,301
the next door neighbor,

248
00:06:32,301 --> 00:06:36,650
they got a battering ram broke down his
fucking door because he's selling crack.

249
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:39,500
And he had like an Audi like next door.

250
00:06:39,501 --> 00:06:40,820
Like this is fucking Newark,

251
00:06:40,821 --> 00:06:41,361
New Jersey.

252
00:06:41,361 --> 00:06:42,470
It's a shitty spot.

253
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:43,220
Oh Shit.

254
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:47,690
And my grandfather was taking care of
my grandmother and it was just me and my

255
00:06:47,691 --> 00:06:48,890
grandfather and my grandmother.

256
00:06:48,891 --> 00:06:51,380
It was like one of the
lowest points in my life.

257
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:53,300
I had just broken up with my girlfriend.

258
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:57,080
I had just torn my ACL and I
knew that I needed surgery.

259
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,640
I just moved to New York.

260
00:06:58,940 --> 00:06:59,930
I was completely,

261
00:06:59,931 --> 00:07:02,690
totally broke and I was,

262
00:07:02,691 --> 00:07:03,290
you know,

263
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:04,340
taking this big risk,

264
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:05,180
moving to New York.

265
00:07:05,181 --> 00:07:08,150
I'd signed with Sussman and I want to
remember that was trying to get my shit

266
00:07:08,151 --> 00:07:08,810
together.

267
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:12,560
And my grandmother like Moans,

268
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,461
like she's,

269
00:07:13,461 --> 00:07:15,830
she's hurt so bad she can't move.

270
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:17,450
She had an aneurysm 12 years ago,

271
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:19,080
so she's just lying in bed like that.

272
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:22,083
Aneurism

273
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:23,560
just paint all the time.

274
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:24,430
She's done is,

275
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:25,290
she's done from the,

276
00:07:25,291 --> 00:07:25,900
here's a,

277
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:27,430
they gave her 72 hours to live.

278
00:07:27,431 --> 00:07:28,660
She lived for 12 years.

279
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:30,400
Yeah.

280
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,840
And it wasn't a good 12 years.

281
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:33,130
It wasn't a good 12 years.

282
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:35,440
It's your grandfather
was getting zero action.

283
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:37,570
I'd probably do whatever you want it.

284
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:44,620
This is exactly what I was saying earlier.

285
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:49,630
[inaudible]

286
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:54,190
you can hide the fucking cannoli.

287
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:57,620
Is Ned fucking Beluga?

288
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,500
She's going to be hairy guy.

289
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:09,410
That fucking God goes.

290
00:08:09,411 --> 00:08:10,140
She could,

291
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:10,680
oh,

292
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,520
she got a big fucking juicy guy.

293
00:08:12,521 --> 00:08:13,354
Who

294
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,173
at the end of it,

295
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:18,620
that's when you know you're done.

296
00:08:18,621 --> 00:08:19,454
When you hit the Gaga.

297
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:24,130
What I fucking do her,

298
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:25,723
my brother,

299
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:26,660
I don't know.

300
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:30,410
She's moaning because of the
aneurism cause I'm hitting the gun.

301
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:38,331
Oh,

302
00:08:38,331 --> 00:08:39,164
it's awful.

303
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:41,660
Poor Lady.

304
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:41,781
Oh,

305
00:08:41,781 --> 00:08:42,291
it was rough.

306
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:42,741
It was rough,

307
00:08:42,741 --> 00:08:43,574
man.

308
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,291
Let me get my ice.

309
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:44,710
Can't stop.

310
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:45,161
What do I get?

311
00:08:45,161 --> 00:08:45,994
Allergies.

312
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,070
This is laughing.

313
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:49,330
I'm crying too,

314
00:08:49,331 --> 00:08:50,164
man.

315
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,270
It's such douchey thing

316
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:56,821
at a time.

317
00:08:56,821 --> 00:09:00,780
Thing is so douchey and I'm a more
offended because I know so many of those

318
00:09:00,781 --> 00:09:01,160
people.

319
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:05,310
I'm more offended if I was files a
waspy guy and I grew up in Phoenix.

320
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,770
I wouldn't really be
concentrating on these people.

321
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:09,810
But it's like being around like,

322
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:11,490
and knowing once you've escaped,

323
00:09:11,491 --> 00:09:11,760
like,

324
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,420
oh,

325
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:14,100
and then you watch real
housewives in New Jersey.

326
00:09:14,101 --> 00:09:15,540
Like I wasn't wrong.

327
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:16,291
I wasn't,

328
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:17,230
I didn't miss this.

329
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,310
You people are fucking savages.

330
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:22,630
Okay.
