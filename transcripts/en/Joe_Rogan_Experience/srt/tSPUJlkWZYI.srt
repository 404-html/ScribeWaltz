1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,980
Try Joe Rogan podcast by night all day,
but I didn't see it.

2
00:00:04,981 --> 00:00:09,981
I wish that a fighter's appreciate the 
science of boxing more.

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:15,150
When GSP one of those fights he train 
with Freddie Roach and it came back with

4
00:00:15,151 --> 00:00:17,790
that Fucking Jab.
It made waves,

5
00:00:17,791 --> 00:00:22,020
but a lot of people didn't copy that.
Arlovski did first it was like,

6
00:00:22,021 --> 00:00:23,210
no,
let's just go boosh,

7
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:23,851
you know,
he's like,

8
00:00:23,851 --> 00:00:27,900
holy Amanda Nunez boxing trainers.
Howard Davis,

9
00:00:27,901 --> 00:00:28,810
his son.
Okay.

10
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:30,450
And American top team.
So she's,

11
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:33,090
I don't know why people don't 
incorporate it that much.

12
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:35,220
More like that.
This is so much to learn.

13
00:00:35,221 --> 00:00:39,360
You said there's three levels of 
striking pretty much in the UFC.

14
00:00:39,361 --> 00:00:41,970
You know,
we had a discussion last night when,

15
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:42,500
when,
uh,

16
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,580
the Jujitsu guy won.
Seventy came in,

17
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:45,953
you know,
he came in and he was a great Jujitsu 

18
00:00:47,251 --> 00:00:48,160
guy.
He wanted a,

19
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:51,570
what's his name?
The guy that triangle jail from the top.

20
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,040
Damien.
Damien Maia.

21
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:53,933
That guy came in.
He went to the first couple of matches 

22
00:00:55,981 --> 00:00:58,680
Jujitsu.
Then somebody told him he was a boxer.

23
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,100
He started getting lit up and it 
happened.

24
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:06,170
He's fucking back to just grab your leg 
and it's all funded.

25
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:09,870
Rhonda.
Hundred percent.

26
00:01:09,871 --> 00:01:10,950
Rhonda just said,
okay,

27
00:01:10,951 --> 00:01:11,880
I'm gonna.
Take a year off.

28
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:17,150
I'm going to go to the Olympic wrestling
a facility wherever.

29
00:01:17,251 --> 00:01:20,220
Just focus on wrestling.
Still work on your striking.

30
00:01:20,221 --> 00:01:21,960
Go with Duane Ludwig.
That would be awesome.

31
00:01:21,961 --> 00:01:23,400
Or,
or Rafael Cordeiro.

32
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:24,720
Mix it up.
You know what I mean?

33
00:01:24,721 --> 00:01:26,490
You've got to change shit up now 
obviously.

34
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,920
Um,
but wrestling should be the focus.

35
00:01:28,921 --> 00:01:33,030
When you see a Rhonda Rousey Promo,
you shouldn't see her getting mets.

36
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:36,030
You should see her shooting,
getting the clench.

37
00:01:36,031 --> 00:01:37,830
Double leg,
take down singles.

38
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:42,950
It should be wrestling every day.
Twice a day for think about her camp,

39
00:01:43,421 --> 00:01:45,750
her whole camp.
It's just a boxing gym.

40
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:49,980
Coaches a boxing coach,
so they want her to be this boxer.

41
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:51,023
People sold her as a next Mike Tyson.
So you have all that coming in and she 

42
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,000
was murky and girls remember I was on 
board.

43
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:57,000
I'm like,
damn her striking.

44
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,340
She's knocking bitches out.
Then you start to level.

45
00:01:59,341 --> 00:02:00,920
It's like,
what's coming up?

46
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:02,630
She's knocking them out of that.
But.

47
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:04,860
But I,
I think the media in a lot of people are

48
00:02:04,861 --> 00:02:05,490
like,
Dang she,

49
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:08,920
she's a knockout artists.
So you hear those in her going,

50
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:10,920
your knockout artist,
you can strike with anyone.

51
00:02:10,921 --> 00:02:12,150
Right.
And her coach like,

52
00:02:12,151 --> 00:02:13,590
look,
that was always the case.

53
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:16,110
You remember when Gerald fought in the 
UFC,

54
00:02:16,111 --> 00:02:16,944
it was always the case when Gerald is a.
was he a black male back then or brown 

55
00:02:19,951 --> 00:02:20,820
belt?
It was a brown belt.

56
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:24,960
Really Good Jujitsu guy though.
But his fucking striking coach had it.

57
00:02:24,961 --> 00:02:27,870
I'm convinced that he was a Thai boxer.
He's like,

58
00:02:27,871 --> 00:02:28,920
you're going to go out there and get a 
kick.

59
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:29,903
And I remember Eddie and I would watch 
him hit the bag and hit the meds and 

60
00:02:33,181 --> 00:02:33,811
stuff.
And I was like,

61
00:02:33,811 --> 00:02:36,390
man,
there's some scary guys in the UFC.

62
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:38,610
And he got a real scary one.
And Josh Thompson,

63
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:40,730
Josh Thompson was like,
Yep,

64
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:43,530
none of that.
No,

65
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:44,241
no,
it wasn't.

66
00:02:44,241 --> 00:02:47,030
It didn't go down like that and then got
happening.

67
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:48,023
No.
What ended up happening as Gerald's 

68
00:02:49,231 --> 00:02:51,810
Jujitsu's jokes treatment as we're 
talking about his.

69
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:55,050
He was my first student,
my first before 10th planet.

70
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:58,770
I was teaching Jujitsu to a guy named 
Gerald Street,

71
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:01,540
then he a blue belt at the time and I 
brought them up,

72
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:03,330
shut him up.
He got really good at the twister,

73
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:06,040
really good at rubber guard,
rubber who first meet Hook,

74
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:08,890
rubber guard triangle and MMA history.
Uh,

75
00:03:08,891 --> 00:03:09,724
in a gladiator challenge show.
He was kicking ass and then he fires 

76
00:03:12,251 --> 00:03:17,251
John Silva in England in London,
and it was a spectacular match.

77
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:20,920
A Joe showed that fight to,
uh,

78
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:21,880
uh,
Dana White.

79
00:03:21,881 --> 00:03:23,860
Dana white game was shot game.
Josh Thompson,

80
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:28,250
he started,
he started working more a pie with this,

81
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:30,610
this Muay Thai coach,
and it was six months.

82
00:03:30,611 --> 00:03:32,560
He was training six months with them,
right.

83
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:34,690
And he'd been doing any.
He wrestled in high school as well.

84
00:03:34,691 --> 00:03:38,230
So He'd been grappling a total at that 
point.

85
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:43,410
Joey reading into the mic.
I'm hearing some for sure.

86
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:46,410
Joe was just confused in my head.

87
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:53,120
But anyway,
so anyway,

88
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:55,330
so he was interested and it's an 
interesting point.

89
00:03:55,331 --> 00:03:58,210
I was just thinking about this.
It's the exact same thing.

90
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:02,230
It's when I'm,
when I'm striking like let's say I got,

91
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:04,480
I'm a striker,
Muy Thai,

92
00:04:04,481 --> 00:04:05,314
came in and he'd been doing more type 
for 10 years and he wanted to learn the 

93
00:04:07,151 --> 00:04:09,580
ground and he was doing mma.
He's already fighting.

94
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,690
MMA.
Comes up a lot.

95
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:13,540
I'm going to show them Jujitsu.
I'm going to be in his corner.

96
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:17,930
I'm not going to be telling him to take 
his ass down and work up into Jitsu.

97
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:18,930
Well,
guard,

98
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:20,040
I'm like,
you just it.

99
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:24,400
It's been six months this relaxed,
but what I was getting involved,

100
00:04:24,401 --> 00:04:25,234
what I want to see is that dude when 
with his tie and it gives me another 

101
00:04:29,381 --> 00:04:30,214
fight to get his Jujitsu and again,
the longer we void that you did sue in 

102
00:04:33,581 --> 00:04:34,910
my eyes,
the patter we.

103
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:36,580
Whew.
We got away with another one.

104
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:40,860
Now we have another four or five months 
to work on the Jujitsu way of looking at

105
00:04:40,861 --> 00:04:42,880
it,
but there's a lot out.

106
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,833
There's a lot of strikers striking 
coaches out there that will take some 

107
00:04:46,061 --> 00:04:46,894
grappler in,
teach them striking for six months and 

108
00:04:49,391 --> 00:04:50,224
then a corner him in an mma fight and 
like instruct him to stand with this 

109
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,450
motherfucker.
Pull the guy to the side state.

110
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:58,960
Do,
don't listen to this guy.

111
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,090
You're not standing.
Do you remember what he said?

112
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,310
You know how many times I had to say 
that up like my guys,

113
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:03,920
like,
tell him,

114
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,810
listen to this motherfucker.
He's taking this motherfucker.

115
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:09,940
He came out in jail.
I remember what he said.

116
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,040
Do you remember what he said to him?
He's ready.

117
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:14,260
Yes.
In six months instead was Bangkok.

118
00:05:14,261 --> 00:05:15,094
Greg,
he's going to go out there,

119
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:20,040
so this is what I look at it.

120
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:22,120
It was a.
It was a good thing.

121
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:24,370
It's a good thing because this is what 
happened.

122
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:25,443
Is He Adam,
so believing that he was Bangkok ready 

123
00:05:27,131 --> 00:05:30,970
after six months of Moitai that when he 
did the walkout in the UFC,

124
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:36,090
he came out with a,
a,

125
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:40,210
a,
a bicep bracelets or whatever,

126
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:42,543
tigar dancing,
and during the time he was in the 

127
00:05:45,221 --> 00:05:48,560
octagon and did you know he went around 
the Octagon and blessed?

128
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:51,910
Yes.
Doing that through Josh Thompson sitting

129
00:05:51,911 --> 00:05:53,800
there and I talked to Josh Donaldson 
since then.

130
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:57,770
Josh Thompson wrestled in high school 
and he's a good striker.

131
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:00,380
He was fucking up people off his back.
He was triangling people.

132
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:03,080
We knew all about Josh Thompson.
Gerald was not.

133
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:06,350
He was not in the best frame of mind for
that fight.

134
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,393
You know what?
Because Josh Thompson was a fucking 

135
00:06:08,961 --> 00:06:10,670
killer back then.
He was a kid.

136
00:06:10,671 --> 00:06:12,230
Well,
he was in his prime back then.

137
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:14,780
That was josh when he was.
He was one of the top,

138
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:20,200
like five or six guys in the division.
He got rid of the 155 pound division.

139
00:06:21,471 --> 00:06:24,620
It was him and Eve Edwards and Eve 
Edwards knocked him out.

140
00:06:24,621 --> 00:06:26,160
I was like,
Eva,

141
00:06:26,161 --> 00:06:28,340
where's became an uncrowned king?
So this would happen.

142
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:29,533
So luckily,
and this is according to Josh Thompson 

143
00:06:31,941 --> 00:06:32,810
told me,
Josh goes,

144
00:06:32,811 --> 00:06:33,644
dude,
I was so worried about a standard time 

145
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,753
stop that when we saw the fight,
my whole thing was how do we know the 

146
00:06:43,691 --> 00:06:44,524
whole.
The whole thing was for sure Josh 

147
00:06:45,801 --> 00:06:47,810
Tomlin's not going to want to go to the 
ground with Gerald.

148
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,560
That's where all this good shit is.
He's fucking people up in Nma.

149
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:54,140
All his fights up until the USC was 
fucking people up with the Jujitsu.

150
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,030
So how are we going to get the fight to 
the ground?

151
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:58,340
We were thinking about pulling an 
elaborate,

152
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:00,260
a unorthodox cardpool.

153
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:01,123
How are we going to do it?
That's what I was thinking like six 

154
00:07:02,751 --> 00:07:03,500
months.
I go,

155
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,390
I know he thinks he's Bangkok ready.
That's six months,

156
00:07:05,391 --> 00:07:07,080
man,
you know,

157
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,440
so,
so,

158
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:13,490
so.
So Josh takes him down and I was sitting

159
00:07:13,491 --> 00:07:15,250
there thinking,
what the fuck thing?

160
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:16,783
He takes a general dental because he's 
so worried about his tie and Gerald do 

161
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:26,000
right away throws up a hellfire with his
guard.

162
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:29,030
He threw a lot of heat.
It was pretty bad ass to see.

163
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:32,630
But at the end of the day,
first he almost had him in an arm bar.

164
00:07:32,631 --> 00:07:36,380
Josh pulls out and then there's like a 
scramble on the ground.

165
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:39,430
Gerald ghost for a leg lock because he 
finally pulls out of his garden.

166
00:07:39,431 --> 00:07:40,264
Then general who was really good at like
locks and he went for a leg lock and 

167
00:07:42,831 --> 00:07:45,830
then Josh Thompson hit him like in the 
back of the head of the killer.

168
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:47,550
That was one of those.
Yeah.

169
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:49,260
That was one of those going,
you know,

170
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,320
going to lead boxes.
Risky.

171
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,120
What started this all off?
Uh Oh.

172
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:55,013
You bolded those coaches.
Coaches get these fucking people 

173
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,333
convinced that they're trying to kill 
killer in one particular camp though 

174
00:08:01,401 --> 00:08:04,100
because in every campus,
especially if you have like a super star

175
00:08:04,101 --> 00:08:07,370
camp and it come from my own personal 
experience,

176
00:08:07,371 --> 00:08:10,370
you have a superstar wrestling coach,
boxing coach,

177
00:08:10,371 --> 00:08:11,930
Jujitsu coach,
you know,

178
00:08:11,931 --> 00:08:12,764
you're spending your time with them.
They want to see you win with all their 

179
00:08:15,381 --> 00:08:17,290
shit.
Yes.

180
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:22,390
Even my coaches get tossed them off.
The W should be number fucking war.

181
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,210
It's nice when they win with some shit 
of course,

182
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,073
like fucked up.
Like you showed me that shit that's 

183
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:31,050
always good,
but it's all about the Goddamn dumpy.

184
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:35,180
That's number why you gotta have like a 
head coach.

185
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:37,640
You got to have a head coach that's not 
a striking coach.

186
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:40,370
Hundreds like a head coach,
Matt Hume as a head coach.

187
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:43,760
You know like when he works with Dj,
they do everything,

188
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:45,710
you know,
they work on submissions together,

189
00:08:45,711 --> 00:08:46,760
spar together,
he worked,

190
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:47,603
they work on all these different 
techniques and it's total technique and 

191
00:08:51,231 --> 00:08:52,064
tactics oriented conversations.
And how many stars are though in the 

192
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:55,830
world?
Like five.

193
00:08:56,010 --> 00:09:00,270
If one is honestly this like in my mind 
it's like he,

194
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,940
if he's not number one,
it's him and for us a hobby,

195
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:07,170
but I count two that can do it all.
That really know the game in and out.

196
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:10,050
Can do a game plan from standing to 
restroom to grapple.

197
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:10,771
Yeah.
I wouldn't mean.

198
00:09:10,771 --> 00:09:13,410
I think those are the one guy might be 
better for you.

199
00:09:13,411 --> 00:09:15,460
One guy might be better for the other,
but those are the.

200
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:16,323
Those are the top dogs too because 
there's such wizards on the ground are 

201
00:09:19,081 --> 00:09:21,420
wizards to and they.
They could physically do it too.

202
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:24,330
That's like a big part of it and plus 
they know the transition.

203
00:09:24,331 --> 00:09:26,460
Like sometimes if you go to a pure 
Jujitsu guy,

204
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:27,210
you're like,
dude,

205
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:28,043
this isn't gonna work.
If I commit both hands this I'm gonna 

206
00:09:30,061 --> 00:09:30,894
get blast in the face.
Do you remember what George Grid Gel 

207
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:34,620
like?
He was a black belt in Brazilian Jujitsu

208
00:09:34,621 --> 00:09:36,120
back when there was very few black 
belts,

209
00:09:36,121 --> 00:09:36,954
but then he became.
He wanted to stand and bang with 

210
00:09:38,251 --> 00:09:41,610
everybody and that was his thing.
He became this thing standing in banging

211
00:09:41,611 --> 00:09:44,400
and that's.
That happens so often.

212
00:09:44,401 --> 00:09:45,234
It's so crazy.
It's so rare that a guy comes back and 

213
00:09:48,331 --> 00:09:49,830
figures it out.
Like Damien Maia House.

214
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,650
Damien Maia tried it that way for 
awhile.

215
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,513
Yup.
You got sucked into it and they figured 

216
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:54,890
that's exactly the time.

217
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,490
Rhonda should they took it to what says 
expression.

218
00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:00,530
You go to the dance or took it to their 
expression.

219
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:05,330
I don't know.
I know a lot of early.

220
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:10,430
I saw a lot of high level Jujitsu guys 
come into the UFC that the hands a Mensa

221
00:10:10,951 --> 00:10:14,790
mense yeah.
Like it's like a three striking and they

222
00:10:14,791 --> 00:10:15,624
never evolved to that.
Now the fucking striking is evolving 

223
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:23,120
quick a quick,
you know,

224
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:27,540
it used to be that the only guys that,
the only black belts that got to the UFC

225
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:32,541
were like the guys that were only 
dedicated their lives to get to.

226
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,730
They just started learning and striking.
You can tell,

227
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:37,013
you can tell like holy shit,
they're just trying to fucking get some 

228
00:10:39,661 --> 00:10:40,920
kind of clench.
It's obvious,

229
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:41,993
but now with,
there's so many goddamn black belts in 

230
00:10:44,221 --> 00:10:47,070
Brazil now that it's not about,
it's all about,

231
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:47,940
you know,
here's,

232
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:48,773
here's 100 black belts in the camp.
We're only going to take the best 

233
00:10:51,061 --> 00:10:53,400
strikers.
Like the fierce ones.

234
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:54,270
You know,
the guy,

235
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:57,600
the days of pure Jujitsu guys coming out
and looking like this,

236
00:10:57,930 --> 00:10:59,700
that there are long gone now.
You can't,

237
00:10:59,701 --> 00:11:00,534
you can't get,
get through the minor leagues swiping 

238
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:03,900
like that.
Your attitude is like,

239
00:11:03,901 --> 00:11:04,734
I got this.
