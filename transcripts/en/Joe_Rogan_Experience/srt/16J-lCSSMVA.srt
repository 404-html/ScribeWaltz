1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,800
Gentlemen.
We're a little lie.

2
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:07,550
Yeah, Dude. Steve, old ladies and
gentlemen, Prime Room in the house.

3
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:13,060
A steevo preparing himself for his long
stretch in the pokey from mockings.

4
00:00:14,241 --> 00:00:18,650
Seaworld openly, uh, on top
of a very dangerous sign.

5
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:22,310
Do there's a video of you,
you were streaming live while you,

6
00:00:22,311 --> 00:00:24,260
you fucked with the seaworld sign.

7
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:28,770
I had two different ones. I had the
highway sign where I change it to say see,

8
00:00:28,771 --> 00:00:33,100
road sucks. And then there's the one where
I climbed up the 150 foot tall crane.

9
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:39,550
Okay. I think both of them made
me shit, my pants. One of them.

10
00:00:39,551 --> 00:00:43,630
We were watching it. Brian and I were
watching it and my toes were curling.

11
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:46,630
I know you're watching it
live. Lifting up. Yeah.

12
00:00:46,631 --> 00:00:51,340
We were watching your wife when
were in see rod when you are,

13
00:00:51,341 --> 00:00:55,510
I mean San Diego and you were doing the
sign one climbing up the sign and he

14
00:00:55,511 --> 00:00:58,450
kept on calling my head.
Yeah. Oh Dude. Yeah.

15
00:00:58,451 --> 00:01:03,400
How did you live in and out,
man, that was seem our fall.

16
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,590
That was like appropriate. It was right
there down in San Diego, near seaworld.

17
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:12,020
The highway science said seaworld drive
and I had changed it to say seaworld

18
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:14,320
sucks and like I said,
it was appropriate.

19
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:18,820
My crane one was completely fucking
idiotic. There is a, it's like, okay,

20
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:23,200
let me protests. Seaworld and
some random construction site.

21
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:25,960
Nowhere fucking near sea world,
you know,

22
00:01:25,961 --> 00:01:28,900
let me fucking bring an
inflatable killer whale,

23
00:01:28,901 --> 00:01:33,620
like a toy whale client up 150 foot
crane when you're 150 feet up in the air,

24
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:36,760
nobody, no one's going to be able to
see your fucking toy whale, you know,

25
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:41,100
so done with that. Dot. Right.
Steven won A. Dot. I never knew.

26
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,990
They know vendor could even tell him side.
By the time I get up there,

27
00:01:43,991 --> 00:01:48,490
I got 80 firefighters, 18 cops,
a helicopter and a swat team.

28
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:52,120
I'm like,
that stuff is,

29
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:56,260
if something real was going down
and they had put all the resources,

30
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:59,470
trust me, I get it. That's
why I'm going to jail.

31
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:04,870
How long are you going to jail?
I have a 30 day sentence,

32
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,910
but I don't think I'll like,
I have done that.

33
00:02:06,911 --> 00:02:10,780
I think the automatically cut it in half
and then maybe even get out quicker.

34
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:15,880
How does that work? I didn't
necessarily have to go to jail at all.

35
00:02:15,881 --> 00:02:16,691
Like I asked my,

36
00:02:16,691 --> 00:02:21,320
I had my lawyer to get me jail time
specifically because my fucking cranes.

37
00:02:21,321 --> 00:02:25,690
Dot was so idiotic. Ah. I was
like, man, I gotta go to jail.

38
00:02:25,691 --> 00:02:29,530
That would be the only one tiny little
part of it. That makes any sense at all.

39
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:35,290
Because like if you're trying to make
a statement about captivity, right.

40
00:02:35,291 --> 00:02:38,620
You know, put yourself and kept,
right. That's the whole deal.

41
00:02:38,621 --> 00:02:43,090
So I asked for it and, and um, so you
asked for jail, like you could do that.

42
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:47,340
I'm sure I could. I could have done like
community service, like a, you know,

43
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:51,490
whatever. Like I was like, Nah,
dude, because I'm a fucking
intention hoard. So like,

44
00:02:51,491 --> 00:02:55,360
I'm like, dude, like, like scrubbing
graffiti. That's not a cool story.

45
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:59,010
Like going to jail. That's a headline.
You know, like, I'm going to get fucking,

46
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:02,480
I'm gonna, I'm gonna,
I'm gonna get, you know,

47
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:06,550
Steve was going to jail. That's
a fucking, that's newsworthy.

48
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:11,110
So ridiculous. Yeah. Welcome to my world.

49
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:17,740
Did you say that to the dough to the judge
never even had to go to court because

50
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:22,600
they all, they all worked it out.
So when they kept postponing my,

51
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:26,560
my arraignment and when uh,
the way, you know everybody,

52
00:03:26,561 --> 00:03:31,120
by the time that the prosecutor and
my lawyer finally worked out a deal,

53
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:33,880
then when the arraignment was
back on and they said, hey,

54
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:36,190
we reached a deal and then
they close it all down

55
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,670
in the jail before.
Sure.

56
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:43,600
I've got,

57
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:48,370
I've got the fucking most
hilarious criminal record
ever did like was the first

58
00:03:48,371 --> 00:03:50,730
time, the first time, uh,

59
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:56,170
I was like 16 or 17 they go to high
school in England and just got nailed with

60
00:03:56,171 --> 00:04:00,100
some weed chill and another country.
Oh,

61
00:04:00,101 --> 00:04:01,810
I've been to jail in like five countries,

62
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:08,290
five but I've been see Canada,
England, America, Sweden,

63
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:12,160
and I'm not counting Mexico because
that was more of a catch and release,

64
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:18,430
fly fishing.
Right.

65
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:23,030
Would it happened in Cancun,
Mexico? Ah, it was like, I was, uh,

66
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:26,680
you know, like blacking
out on special k, you know,

67
00:04:26,681 --> 00:04:29,860
like ketamine and I was like
climbing on this roof. And like,

68
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:33,490
I kinda like fell off of it
and, and uh, I don't know.

69
00:04:33,491 --> 00:04:37,920
They just grabbed me and detained
me. Oh yeah. The, I mean,

70
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:41,460
I wasn't like, uh, yeah, but it, but it
was pretty scary. I mean, it was like,

71
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:44,670
it was a legit, when you're in, when
you're in Mexico, like that's fucked me.

72
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:49,340
I fucked up. You can vanish. Yeah.
Like a lot of people vanished.

73
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:53,350
Chapo God,
no.

74
00:04:53,351 --> 00:04:57,100
Apparently they were closing in on him
and he fell and broke his leg and he was

75
00:04:57,101 --> 00:05:01,600
carried off by his guards. Wow.
Apparently labor, their clothes,

76
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:06,030
they keep closing in on him. Right. But
that's a good, a good disappeared for the,

77
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:09,070
for that guy. He's psyched.
It disappeared. Most
people disappear in Mexico.

78
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:12,430
Totally not cycle.
That's a very good point.

79
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:15,310
People vanished in Mexico.
Like those students,

80
00:05:15,311 --> 00:05:19,540
like the 43 students that were
murdered, it's just scary shit. Right.

81
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:23,260
So when you were in Mexico, when you
were, would you sober up in jail?

82
00:05:23,261 --> 00:05:28,220
Did you like realize what
had happened now? Like a man,

83
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:32,020
I don't know. I mean, I guess like
a, it all just kind of worked out.

84
00:05:32,021 --> 00:05:35,980
Like it wasn't, it wasn't a big deal,
you know. Um, they, they let me go,

85
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:40,150
but, uh, they just kicked
Joe. Yeah. In Sweden.

86
00:05:40,151 --> 00:05:45,151
I was in like properly in jail for
fucking five days for international drug

87
00:05:46,091 --> 00:05:50,910
smuggling. Rich bring in, well, what
I did, I was videotaping it and uh,

88
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:55,450
um, I was in Norway and I put a
bunch of weed and do a condom.

89
00:05:55,451 --> 00:05:59,120
I tied it and I'm not, and
swallowed it, choked on it.

90
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,520
And I was like puking up blood
trying to get it out. Like,

91
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:08,360
so then I flew from Norway to
Sweden so that it would, you know,

92
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:13,520
put it on video, go. Yeah,
totally. And then like put it
on the Internet. Well, yeah,

93
00:06:13,521 --> 00:06:15,500
I mean later, you know, but um,

94
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:20,150
so how'd the Swat Swat it in Norway
and got an airplane to Sweden, so that,

95
00:06:20,151 --> 00:06:23,030
so that way I'm crossing
international lines, you know,

96
00:06:23,031 --> 00:06:27,800
to qualify as an international
drug smuggler. Then when
I got to Sweden, you know,

97
00:06:27,801 --> 00:06:32,000
I had my, in my, I was promoting my tour
every interview. Like there they say like,

98
00:06:32,001 --> 00:06:35,220
Oh yeah, how you doing? And listen, I'm
man, I think I might die of intestinal,

99
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:39,590
the strangulation because I swallowed
this big package of drugs and it won't

100
00:06:39,591 --> 00:06:41,060
come out. You know, cause it took days,

101
00:06:41,061 --> 00:06:44,810
it didn't come out for like six and a
half days. So the says so every like,

102
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:48,950
like a reporter, like read the,
read the article or whatever it was.

103
00:06:48,951 --> 00:06:52,760
And the cops were at the newspaper and
so then they, they, they, they, uh,

104
00:06:52,761 --> 00:06:57,290
they arrested me like after
I shit it out. And, um,

105
00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:00,980
and they took me to the jail
and, and um, you know, they got,

106
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:04,550
they brought me into the,
from the jail to the hospital,

107
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,530
put me in this like cat scan machine,

108
00:07:06,531 --> 00:07:09,560
which revealed they said a
foreign object in my body.

109
00:07:09,561 --> 00:07:14,270
It's still don't know what that was. And,
uh, they kept me in a cell for five days,

110
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:19,160
shitting into a plastic bag,
fucking digging through my shit.

111
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:23,840
Yeah. And like, and then, and
then after five days in there,

112
00:07:23,841 --> 00:07:27,350
they brought me back to the
hospital for another like scan.

113
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:32,180
And it showed that like the foreign object
had only moved like three centimeters,

114
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:34,940
like my body. So like
they're like, oh fuck it.

115
00:07:34,941 --> 00:07:38,630
And they just had me pay a pay a fine
and go, you don't even know what it is.

116
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:42,470
I don't know. I don't know.
They said it was like a

117
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:49,070
key. Now I don't know. They said it
was a sharp and I dunno, like sharp.

118
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:52,550
Yeah, they, I don't, I really
don't know what it was. Maybe
there'd be bullshitting,

119
00:07:52,551 --> 00:07:55,220
but that might be still,
it's been over 10 years.

120
00:07:55,550 --> 00:08:00,230
Did you ever get yourself looked
at again? No. My friend Rosie,

121
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:05,600
I didn't, I didn't even
really care that much. But uh,
yeah, Sweden, I was wild man.

122
00:08:05,601 --> 00:08:06,051
And again,

123
00:08:06,051 --> 00:08:10,580
I was super psyched because I knew I was
on that little scrolling fucking thing

124
00:08:10,581 --> 00:08:14,510
on CNN at the body. He's leading less
sites for that. Well, yeah, I mean I,

125
00:08:14,511 --> 00:08:16,320
I thought I made,
because we can now.

126
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:19,630
Then when they brought me to the
station initially, like they've,

127
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:22,380
they've put my backpack on the
table and they reach into it,

128
00:08:22,381 --> 00:08:25,160
like the first pocket they reach
into the first and they pulled out,

129
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:27,050
it was a fucking ecstasy pill,

130
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:30,920
like with the fucking
head and it had a print,

131
00:08:30,921 --> 00:08:33,680
like an imprint of a smiley face on it,
you know?

132
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:37,310
And I didn't even remember it
being in there. I'm like, fuck,

133
00:08:37,311 --> 00:08:39,310
I didn't know that was in
there. And then I thought, man,

134
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,890
maybe I'll be in Sweden for a while.
But uh,

135
00:08:41,891 --> 00:08:45,300
it turns out that the ecstasy
wasn't even like that. You know,

136
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:47,450
they weren't even that been
out of shape over Brexit. See,

137
00:08:47,451 --> 00:08:51,020
they're more pissed about weed over
there. Really? Yeah. I don't know why.

138
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:54,950
Just because we things well,
because we'd like a,

139
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:57,510
they think it makes you lazy,
I think. And they're not cool.

140
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:02,430
That's how it is in Asia. Why? I
think, you know, they're like this,

141
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:04,960
that makes you lazy and,

142
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:08,910
and we're not fucking lazy people and
so they didn't want to really punish me

143
00:09:08,911 --> 00:09:13,140
for that really frustrates me. That,
that stereotype with weed making me lazy.

144
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:17,610
That drives me crazy. That is the one
that drives me the most nuts. You're lazy.

145
00:09:17,611 --> 00:09:22,020
You're lazy. Does not make you
fucking lazy. It just doesn't,

146
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:26,970
I'm not lazy. It drives me nuts. I
was never lazy man. When I was loaded.

147
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:32,100
No. My longest time in jail, uh,
wigging out. Like I guy I was,

148
00:09:32,101 --> 00:09:34,290
I was in La County jail for five days.

149
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:39,291
One time I got arrested for felony
obscenity and a principal to second degree

150
00:09:41,611 --> 00:09:46,290
battery in Louisiana. Yeah. Because it
was like I was doing my oldest show.

151
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:50,910
What does that mean? Principle too? It
means that I arranged like an assault.

152
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:55,770
What the fuck happened?
Well,

153
00:09:55,850 --> 00:09:59,190
what happened was like I was
doing my old show and um,

154
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:03,540
you know, part of it, it was, I was
chugging out of a Tequila bottle,

155
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:06,420
like throughout the whole thing.
And I'd like, you know, whatever,

156
00:10:06,421 --> 00:10:11,010
like I had the Tequila bottle at the
edge of the stage and um, you know,

157
00:10:11,011 --> 00:10:15,360
some kid like climbed on the stage
and grabbed the bottle and I see these

158
00:10:15,361 --> 00:10:18,990
bouncers come over and just neutralize it.
And I'm like, damn, these guys are good.

159
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:23,040
These fucking bouncers are
our pro. So I, as I said,

160
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:28,220
who wants to get on this stage and try
to run from one side of the stage to the

161
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:32,550
other past the bouncers,
you know,W is British bulldog.

162
00:10:32,551 --> 00:10:36,180
We'll play British bulldog dog and
these guys were going to fuck you up.

163
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:42,990
So there's like one kid who is like the
bony little skinny little 19 year old

164
00:10:42,991 --> 00:10:45,300
kid was like jumping up and down,

165
00:10:45,301 --> 00:10:50,301
like pointing at himself that he was
just so did he wanted it so bad and I

166
00:10:50,791 --> 00:10:54,480
couldn't, like I had to pick him.
So I picked this kid and he ran.

167
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,550
He just ran, you know, I'm videoing it
myself. I said, one, two, three, go.

168
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:04,980
The kid like runs halfway across
the stage and they just grabbed me.

169
00:11:04,981 --> 00:11:09,020
It was totally anticlimactic.
And these three like football player,

170
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:10,950
the college football player bouncers,

171
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:15,690
like they just lifted him up like in
unison, like over their heads and legs,

172
00:11:15,691 --> 00:11:19,820
just like the kid on his head on the
stone. And he was like twitching and,

173
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,830
and like, you know, they think they're,

174
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:25,230
the police reports said he was bleeding
out of an ear or something like,

175
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:28,670
and odd and it was really fucked up.
You know,

176
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:32,430
they do that when they knew that he was
going to run across be, I don't know,

177
00:11:32,431 --> 00:11:36,550
I never said slam him on his head,
you know, I, I'd said that fuck. Um,

178
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:41,920
but uh, but yeah, and so like he knew
in my mind I'm thinking, oh, I do,

179
00:11:41,921 --> 00:11:46,440
this is such a lawsuit. Like this is, this
is bad, you know, so you're not thinking,

180
00:11:46,441 --> 00:11:47,560
oh my God,
this poor kids

181
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:53,980
that to legal fees that too. But
like what a, whatever it was.

182
00:11:53,981 --> 00:11:58,390
He was just all bad, you know, it was
all bad. And in my head, like the mantra,

183
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:03,220
the show must go on, like pretend it's
not bad and just continue. So I'm like,

184
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:08,050
I was like fuck on the video. And
somebody in the crowd was, was uh,

185
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:12,100
had a home video camera rolling on.
I mean this is like, what was it,

186
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:14,950
2002, so like, I mean,

187
00:12:14,951 --> 00:12:18,250
this is before they had cameras on cell
phones and someone's got like a fucking,

188
00:12:18,251 --> 00:12:22,630
like, VHS home video camera
and um, on, on the tape,

189
00:12:22,631 --> 00:12:24,650
which they turned over, they
were like, that's a crimes.

190
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:28,480
You've turned it over to the cops or
they escapes the newspaper and the

191
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:31,900
newspaper gave it to the cops.
So on the thing, I'm like,

192
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:36,810
that kids be loaded into an ambulance
plugin who wants to play another round and

193
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:40,870
we actually pulled it off.
No, I know it was bad.

194
00:12:40,871 --> 00:12:45,710
Did anybody sign up for route?
I can't remember. I can't,
can't remember if we did.

195
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:50,170
We did or not, but, but uh,
[inaudible] salt though,

196
00:12:50,171 --> 00:12:55,171
honestly it was principal to
second degree battery or whatever.

197
00:12:55,181 --> 00:12:58,320
I think that's how I think I have
it right. And like they, you know,

198
00:12:58,321 --> 00:13:02,440
that that was a crime but,
but by the people like watch this video,

199
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:05,140
they really were upset with,
with Steevo.

200
00:13:05,141 --> 00:13:08,140
And so there was another point
in the video where I stayed,

201
00:13:08,141 --> 00:13:13,141
I use an industrial staple gun to
staple my ball sack to my leg and shit.

202
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:17,830
Right. And, uh, so I've got,
I'm covered in blood too, like,

203
00:13:17,831 --> 00:13:19,990
because like part of the
other part of the show,

204
00:13:19,991 --> 00:13:23,890
I break a light bulb over my head and
like pick up like a piece of the broken

205
00:13:23,891 --> 00:13:24,720
glass and like,

206
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,930
like literally slash my tongue because
the tongue like bleed so much and it

207
00:13:28,931 --> 00:13:33,380
heals really fast. I just bleed all over
my sophos Izmir blood everywhere and,

208
00:13:33,381 --> 00:13:35,760
and so I'm covered in blood
and I've, I've, I've got my,

209
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:40,300
my Dick and balls just blatantly out and
I'm holding an industrial staple gun,

210
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:43,390
getting ready to staple my
ball sack to my leg. And I say,

211
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:47,860
this is not art.
This is just to be offensive

212
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:53,500
as stable. My boss to my
leg. And so like, you know,

213
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:55,840
being that it was Louisiana
in one of these parishes,

214
00:13:55,841 --> 00:13:58,810
they deemed that felony obscenity,

215
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:02,230
which was the saving grace man.
Because like,

216
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:06,310
because of the story on that one was like
Steve O got arrested for stapling his

217
00:14:06,311 --> 00:14:07,780
balls to his leg.
You know,

218
00:14:07,781 --> 00:14:11,110
like the thing with the kid didn't really
play that much in the media. You know,

219
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:16,660
he did. He did sue me.
Yeah. For like brain damage.

220
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:20,100
I don't think even he had brain damage,
but I'll tell you right now,

221
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:24,670
he had Brendan for 100%. You get
spiked on your head and some cells die.

222
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:30,000
I mean, maybe 100%
right. But yeah, I like,

223
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:34,240
uh, I got, I got properly
sued. So did you go to cu?

224
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:37,330
Did you lose or did you go to
court? I mean, it was dead settled.

225
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:41,500
We settled it and see
how much he got 50 grand.

226
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:44,490
That's as if it's not that good.
But you know,

227
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:51,860
I think that that's what it
was. It wasn't, did you talk
to them? Maybe 50 grand?

228
00:14:51,861 --> 00:14:53,630
Was my legal fees.
I can't remember.

229
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:57,140
Bounces. You go, why'd you spike them
on his head? Why didn't just grab him?

230
00:14:57,141 --> 00:15:02,100
Like can just grabbed him. I know grabbing
him would have been funny, you know,

231
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:04,660
just grab and take them out of their help.
You know the whole

232
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:10,310
throw him into the audience. Second stage
divers. Yeah. Yeah. They really, really,

233
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:12,220
it was upsetting.
They shouldn't have done that.

234
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:15,900
See the problem is you give people
a green light like that, right?

235
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:18,280
You've seen some shit the
bouncers have done to people.

236
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:22,100
When people climb onto that stage,
there's a green light. I mean it's like,

237
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:24,970
it's sort of like the cop thing,
you know like when,

238
00:15:24,971 --> 00:15:26,680
when cops like did you see that video?

239
00:15:26,681 --> 00:15:30,010
Recent video of the cop grabbing
the school girl. She's in her desk.

240
00:15:30,011 --> 00:15:34,570
She won't get out of her desk and he
just fucking rag dolls her and slams her

241
00:15:34,571 --> 00:15:38,050
and the desk on the ground.
It's when cops have the green light.

242
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,460
When they can do whatever they want to do,

243
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:42,610
then you're leaving it up to the
discretion of this guy that's probably not

244
00:15:42,611 --> 00:15:45,250
thinking that straight.
A little stressed out.

245
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:49,760
Yeah. I got beat up by a few
bounce. There's one guy grabbed me,

246
00:15:49,761 --> 00:15:51,880
took me out back and just
like push me against the wall.

247
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:53,990
Just kept on slapping him in
the face and wouldn't let me go.

248
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:55,520
And he like sat there for like 10.

249
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:59,270
I was like 18 and he's just like
wailing on my face. Then you'll be like,

250
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,730
you going to do that to give
him motherfucker and then
just like punch me again.

251
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:04,730
I felt like I was captured.
Like if I was kidnapped. Yeah.

252
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:08,180
That's kind of grabbing the salt really.
Like, cause I was outside of the club.

253
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:10,430
He was just ramming the,
against the wall and shit.

254
00:16:10,431 --> 00:16:11,890
Like they're not supposed to do that yet,

255
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:14,210
but we left that club
in Louisiana that night.

256
00:16:14,211 --> 00:16:18,250
I knew I was going to hear about
it again. And um, and Sharon off,

257
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:20,570
like it took a couple of
weeks, but um, you know,

258
00:16:20,571 --> 00:16:24,430
I was like sleeping off a cocaine bender
and, and uh, my roommate comes out,

259
00:16:24,431 --> 00:16:28,100
he says, hey man, you really got to get
up for this. And there's like the La,

260
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:31,870
the La fugitive division. They
had it like they, they had, uh,

261
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:37,100
a fugitive warrant out of
Louisiana. The with um, for you.

262
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:40,970
Yay. Yeah, there's a, the,
there are two, two charges,

263
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:45,740
the felony obscenity and then the, the
second, second degree battery thing. La,

264
00:16:45,741 --> 00:16:48,770
she just let that felony obscenity slide,
but they should be like,

265
00:16:48,771 --> 00:16:52,100
you keep that yourself,
you fucking redneck douchebags yeah,

266
00:16:52,101 --> 00:16:54,260
but you know that I love that charge.

267
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:59,200
And the thing is my favorite Jack.
Right.

268
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:01,670
But the thing was that like they,
they,

269
00:17:01,671 --> 00:17:06,170
they gave me a $120,000 bail,

270
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:09,620
like, or warrant for,
uh, for the, the battery.

271
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:14,610
And then for the felony obscenity
they gave me a million. Oh my God.

272
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:18,580
The size showed up on the, the
like the fugitive list, like,

273
00:17:18,581 --> 00:17:23,240
and like pull position number one
with one point $12 million bail.

274
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,940
Oh my God said they arrested position.

275
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:35,300
And uh, and so like they,
they, they brought me in and
they're like, what'd you do?

276
00:17:35,301 --> 00:17:37,610
And I'm like, I stapled my
boss to my leg, you know,

277
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:40,050
like that nobody can understand it.
And I,

278
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:44,270
and I was in La County jail
and the protective custody
of where I'll be starting

279
00:17:44,271 --> 00:17:47,240
on December 9th, you're going to put
you in protective custody. White. Yeah.

280
00:17:47,241 --> 00:17:48,260
I mean like I'm,
I'm like,

281
00:17:48,261 --> 00:17:53,261
I kind of high dude any you would
be in protective custody to and uh,

282
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:58,280
you know that, I mean, I, at the time
it was 2002 I just got my back Tattoo,

283
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,260
but the movie wasn't out yet. It's
nobody knew about it. And the cops like,

284
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:03,300
we're pretty psyched to have me in there.
And they,

285
00:18:03,301 --> 00:18:05,760
they brought me into their office,
whatever,

286
00:18:05,761 --> 00:18:09,870
like they're giving me like boxes and
boxes of cookies and stuff and pictures of

287
00:18:09,871 --> 00:18:14,420
my bad tattoo. I remember there they were
like, oh dude, you'll be fine in here,

288
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:19,230
man. Were taking a picture
then my self portrait. Oh yeah,

289
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:24,840
that's right.
And they were like,

290
00:18:24,841 --> 00:18:29,410
oh, you'll be fine in here,
man. This is Robert Downey
jr block. You know, like, uh,

291
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:32,160
we've had the, their listing off
all the celebrities that, that,

292
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:36,170
that have been in there. Yeah. Tommy
Lee, like everybody near there like,

293
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,960
and an odbs always in here.
You're actually in his cell.

294
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:45,340
Yeah. Fuck yeah, this was a good one. Um,

295
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:50,600
the longest I was in jail
was 10 days in Orlando for,

296
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,730
uh, that was, that was for drunk driving.
Now that's fucked up. Yeah. Like that,

297
00:18:56,310 --> 00:19:01,010
that was fucked up. And I remember
like, that was in 1996. And, um,

298
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:05,430
I mean, I hadn't really broken
out yet, you know, so, uh,

299
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:11,020
like I, I couldn't really afford,
I mean, I barely could afford, um,

300
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:15,510
to get to Orlando. Like I lived in south
Florida, like near West Palm Beach.

301
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:18,920
And so I could, I just scraped
money together for a, uh,

302
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:24,000
for a greyhound bus to get to Orlando.
And I was like,

303
00:19:24,001 --> 00:19:27,690
I can't afford, I can afford to
get there once for my arraignment.

304
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:29,430
I can't afford to like go over,

305
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:32,640
get rained and then set a date and then
come back and then come back again.

306
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:37,830
And My, my, uh, I had a public defender,
the public defender had said, yeah,

307
00:19:37,831 --> 00:19:41,370
I saw the video. We're not going to be
able to do much about this. You know,

308
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:44,040
that was the one where my
arrest report said, uh,

309
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:49,130
defendant declined roadside sobriety tests
stating he would prefer to take a nap

310
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:57,000
because I was trying, I was trying to
argue that I wasn't actually drunk.

311
00:19:57,001 --> 00:20:00,990
I was just really tired
and uh,

312
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:05,220
so sides have told the public, the
public defender Guy was like, man,

313
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:09,480
I can't afford to like go home and come
back again. So they got the arraignment.

314
00:20:09,481 --> 00:20:13,920
Can we just like plead guilty and like
asked that I go to jail like right away

315
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:19,170
I said that. So, so that's,

316
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:23,700
that's what we did and I actually did
the whole 10 days. So what is, uh,

317
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:27,300
what's worse? Mexico.
Orlando, as far as jail, um,

318
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:32,550
well that the Mexico
was just like holding,

319
00:20:32,551 --> 00:20:35,040
you know,
like Orlando was like proper,

320
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:40,580
like proper Jelic like process and it
was pretty mellow because like in Orlando

321
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:45,000
they said like, uh, you know,
as you get like, you know,
process, you know, you could,

322
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:46,980
you get, you get like
orientation, you know,

323
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:51,610
kind of breakdown of what it's going to
be like. They give you a tub of like a,

324
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:54,820
like a Tupperware tub of
like your belongings where
you've got like, whatever,

325
00:20:54,821 --> 00:20:57,730
like your blanket. Like
it's so like, you know,

326
00:20:57,731 --> 00:21:02,170
they won't let you have a razor but like
a toothbrush and they're like, this year,

327
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,230
this is your, your belongings. Okay.

328
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:06,280
Like if you're going to have
it at the foot of your bed,

329
00:21:06,281 --> 00:21:08,560
you're going to keep
it like this and like,

330
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:12,340
fucking don't Piss us off.
Don't do anything wrong.

331
00:21:12,341 --> 00:21:17,200
Because if you here pack up
your belongings, you know,

332
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:19,630
then what that means is a,

333
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:23,200
then you're going to pack all your shit
into your tub and you're going into the

334
00:21:23,201 --> 00:21:26,260
fucking dungeon, you know?
And what that means, like, uh,

335
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:30,340
is that like if you're in the dungeon
than down there, they're like,

336
00:21:30,341 --> 00:21:32,680
and they're just not, there's a,
you're just not on camera down there.

337
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:35,440
Like anything can happen to you.
Like, and, and like a, you know,

338
00:21:35,441 --> 00:21:39,220
that was like sort of the, the incentive
to like be on your best behavior,

339
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:43,480
you know, because up here
like everything's on camera
like you can, you know,

340
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,620
and it was just like you don't want to,
you don't want to go to the,

341
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:50,140
they're just letting you know that
if you, if you fuck, if you fuck up,

342
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:51,010
if you fuck up,

343
00:21:51,011 --> 00:21:53,710
you're going down and bad shit's going to
happen to you cause you're going to be,

344
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:56,650
because the only people go
down to the dungeon are like,

345
00:21:56,820 --> 00:22:01,350
like dangerous people that you don't
want to be like fucking with, you know,

346
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:05,750
like they're going to be with
you. And that's that. Yay.

347
00:22:05,751 --> 00:22:07,920
I basically like basically like the,
the,

348
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:13,130
the worst people who are more inclined
to hurt you are in the dungeon and yeah,

349
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:14,201
they,
if I remember,

350
00:22:14,201 --> 00:22:17,440
cause I remember like being like always
on camera no matter what happened.

351
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:19,570
I don't know if it was no cameras,
but they're just like,

352
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:22,030
we're not going to like
down there and nothing can,

353
00:22:22,031 --> 00:22:25,570
nothing's going to be nothing.
Nothing gets stopped. Like
you're going to get far,

354
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:27,760
you're going to get, I'm going
to be fucked. And then it worked.

355
00:22:27,761 --> 00:22:32,590
It kept like everything pretty like civil,
you know, like, cause I, I was, I was,

356
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:36,400
you know, very well behaved. No.
When you're in jail for 10 days,

357
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:38,260
in 10 days,

358
00:22:38,261 --> 00:22:42,490
can you get drugs and 10 days or do you
have to like get to know the system?

359
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:47,020
I don't, I don't think that you're going
to have as much luck in county jelly.

360
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:52,060
Like county jail by definition means
that you have a sentence of less than one

361
00:22:53,231 --> 00:22:57,700
year and then at the point of a, of it
being one year, then it's called prison.

362
00:22:58,270 --> 00:23:00,130
And in prison I think it's like,

363
00:23:00,131 --> 00:23:03,970
that's where you can get whatever
you want and all that. Like, yeah,

364
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:08,100
I don't think La,
I don't think like jail is,

365
00:23:08,101 --> 00:23:12,730
is as you know, probably make hooch is
probably the big thing. Right. I mean,

366
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:16,030
and maybe like, like I even, I don't have
that much experience so I don't know.

367
00:23:16,031 --> 00:23:18,730
But like I couldn't get, uh, yeah,

368
00:23:18,731 --> 00:23:21,920
I was doing like back flips for
extra food and Shit, you know,

369
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:27,100
let me know and we'll give you food. Like
the people that worked there, like God,

370
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:30,100
other inmates, I that like the
people that worked there, you know,

371
00:23:30,101 --> 00:23:33,790
when they had the cart that came
by. And um, and I remember too,

372
00:23:33,791 --> 00:23:36,220
like there was like a, in, in Orlando,

373
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:41,110
the jails are big business and Orlanda
because it's kind of like Mecca, you know,

374
00:23:41,111 --> 00:23:42,320
like maybe even more than Mecca.

375
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:46,080
Like more families like travel
from all over the world too.

376
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:49,610
It's like the biggest sec tourist thing.
So like the business is like,

377
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:53,420
they say like,
you come to Orlando on vacation,

378
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:57,800
you leave on probation
and he return on violation

379
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:00,283
and a,

380
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:03,280
the theme parks, they're
right. They have Disneyland,

381
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:08,350
they fucking seaworld Orlando and San
Antonio closing seaworld down because in

382
00:24:10,791 --> 00:24:13,340
the, in California they just
made it illegal for them to read.

383
00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:16,050
Dude, they fucking made the, the,

384
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:20,250
the band captive breeding in California,

385
00:24:20,251 --> 00:24:21,360
banned captain breeding,

386
00:24:21,361 --> 00:24:26,130
which means that it only applies to the
San Diego seaworld. But that fucking, uh,

387
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:28,260
came down,
whatever that decision was,

388
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:33,430
it was made official like within two
days of me getting my jail sentence.

389
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:37,620
That's amazing. And I like to think,
Matt, maybe it's such a coincidence,

390
00:24:37,621 --> 00:24:41,100
but I like to think that I got, people
started talking about it, you know,

391
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:45,240
like thinking about it and then they're
like, you know what? Fuck those people.

392
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:48,850
Well you definitely did.
He definitely put some attention on it,

393
00:24:48,851 --> 00:24:50,790
but there's been some attention
on it for quite a while.

394
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:54,670
And the movie black fish was the big wars.
That was the big one that woke up.

395
00:24:54,671 --> 00:24:57,770
A lot of people when they just
realize like, Whoa, what, what, what,

396
00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:00,250
what is this place killed?
See Road for me forever.

397
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:03,550
I used to love it going as a kid, I
was always telling you like, you're,

398
00:25:03,551 --> 00:25:06,880
you're going to watch prisoners,
you're going to watch slaves.

399
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:12,010
And it's Super Fun to Dan. It's super
fucked there. They're like water people.

400
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:15,820
I mean there really are like as smart
as human beings just don't affect her

401
00:25:15,821 --> 00:25:20,110
environment harder too because like just
their, their loyalty and shit like that.

402
00:25:20,111 --> 00:25:22,960
Like, humans aren't that loyal?
Well, you could say that,

403
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:27,070
but some humans are and dolphins killed
a lot of babies. Right. You know,

404
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:30,250
like there, there's, they kill baby
dolphins. They rape a lot. This,

405
00:25:30,251 --> 00:25:35,170
they're not the best. Right. I mean
there's not way. So even killing whales,

406
00:25:35,171 --> 00:25:39,820
killer whales killed dolphins. Oh
yeah. And whales. The whales alive.

407
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:43,160
Like this is a hard fucking
world. And the ocean, the word,

408
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:48,200
the ocean's a doggy dog world or a
dolphin eat baby world or a whale killer.

409
00:25:48,551 --> 00:25:50,190
Whale whale.
Sure.

410
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:54,540
There has never been an instance of
a killer whale, you know, and people,

411
00:25:54,541 --> 00:25:59,220
I wouldn't like to calm orchids. That org
is never a tag to Cayman and the wild.

412
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:03,840
It's true. When we were filming wild boys,
we went to Alaska and we will be like,

413
00:26:03,841 --> 00:26:06,960
ran across a pod of, uh, uh, of,

414
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:12,030
of orcas and um, we had Manny,
the crazy shark guy, you know,

415
00:26:12,031 --> 00:26:16,270
like Tarzan looking dude, the ride
sharks everywhere and he was so jazzed.

416
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:19,310
He sees his killing these fucking
killer whales in the wild. He's like,

417
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:23,740
like just dives in to go swim with
them, you know, and like, uh, and we,

418
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:27,190
we had power, we had an inflatable
killer whale there too. And like we,

419
00:26:27,191 --> 00:26:30,720
we towed Pontius like on it,
you know,

420
00:26:30,721 --> 00:26:33,360
like try to like vape,
but you can,

421
00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:36,960
you swim towards these orchids and
then they're out man. They want,

422
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:38,160
they're not to want to hang with you.

423
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:42,520
Yeah, the, but they have saved people.
They've saved drowning people. Oh yeah.

424
00:26:43,130 --> 00:26:44,100
People would capsize

425
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:47,390
boats. They've actually looked,
lifted them up and help them be there.

426
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:50,550
They're very smart.
They say that they have dialects,

427
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:53,760
they have like you can tell they're
different accents. They, they,

428
00:26:53,761 --> 00:26:58,080
they recognize each other.
They stay with the same family for life.

429
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,420
That's why it's so fucked
up when they take them away.

430
00:27:00,421 --> 00:27:03,660
Like you're stealing someone away
like a child away from their mother.

431
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:08,040
It's so fucking dark. And when you see
those seaworld commercials, they're like,

432
00:27:08,041 --> 00:27:12,090
we haven't taken orchids from
the wild and over 34 years.

433
00:27:12,730 --> 00:27:17,360
That's, you imagine if there was a
commercial for like Nabisco and the Bisco.

434
00:27:17,361 --> 00:27:21,450
It was like,
we haven't stolen slaves in over 34 years.

435
00:27:21,451 --> 00:27:25,320
The slides that we have,
we have had them for a long time.

436
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:28,320
That's basically what they're
saying and that's it's fun.

437
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:33,300
Dab Dude, go ahead. I grew up with a zero
day in Ohio and it's really weird how,

438
00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:36,360
you know, growing up they
don't teach you that like, hey,

439
00:27:36,361 --> 00:27:39,900
we captured these guys and that you
always kind of thought like, oh,

440
00:27:39,901 --> 00:27:42,930
they're injured and we helped
them and that's why they're here.

441
00:27:42,931 --> 00:27:45,450
It was always kind of like, oh,
I like c row because I like,

442
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:50,260
I want to see these dolphins do good
and be better. But you know, after,

443
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:54,060
after watching that movie you realize,
you know, it's exact opposite.

444
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:57,000
They just kind of kidnapped slavery.
Yeah.

445
00:27:57,130 --> 00:28:01,570
They say a dolphin has a cerebral cortex.
It's 40% larger than a human beings.

446
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:03,370
I believe it. Yeah, they don't,

447
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:06,310
they don't have the ability
to alter their environment.

448
00:28:06,311 --> 00:28:09,310
They can't pick things up and move
them around. They can't send emails,

449
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:12,160
but they don't have to.
They live in a three d world.

450
00:28:12,161 --> 00:28:15,940
Like they can fly around and their world,
I mean they come up for air,

451
00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:20,500
but in their world they can go left
right up, down. They don't need fingers.

452
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:23,980
Like it's not necessary. So our
idea, like what's intelligence?

453
00:28:23,981 --> 00:28:26,980
It's like if you can't type something,
if you can't build a house,

454
00:28:26,981 --> 00:28:29,350
you're a fucking idiot. You
know? That's how we look at it.

455
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:34,240
But those things that we
define as intelligent when
it comes to human beings are

456
00:28:34,241 --> 00:28:38,410
completely unnecessary. They go where
the water's warm. The Fisher everywhere.

457
00:28:38,411 --> 00:28:42,250
Fisher stupid as fuck. They swim
up to him. My Jack, him dolphins,

458
00:28:42,251 --> 00:28:45,970
probably never starved to death. I
mean, they're faster than fish. I mean,

459
00:28:45,971 --> 00:28:50,020
I guess they die of old age,
but you gotta think like if,

460
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:54,190
unless they run out of fish, fish are
probably easiest fuck for them to catch.

461
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:58,360
They just swim up and Jack Them.
It's like food is floating around the sky.

462
00:28:58,570 --> 00:28:59,740
Imagine if every way you went,

463
00:28:59,741 --> 00:29:03,850
like their sandwiches just floating
around in front of you and just hang out

464
00:29:03,851 --> 00:29:07,420
with your homeys and grab a sandwich. I
mean, that's definitely worth shit. Yeah,

465
00:29:07,421 --> 00:29:10,930
that's dolphin world.
But they do do some dark shit,

466
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:14,580
but they usually do it in the name of
breeding. It's why female dolphins,

467
00:29:14,581 --> 00:29:18,460
so like super slutty through super
slutty because they want to have,

468
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:21,730
because the mail, they can't
recognize lines of paternity so they,

469
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:24,430
they don't necessarily know
whether or not the babies, there's,

470
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:29,380
so if they've go up to a chick and she's
got babies and they have never had sex

471
00:29:29,381 --> 00:29:30,730
with her,
the women,

472
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:35,590
the female dolphins won't have sex until
their baby has reached like maturity

473
00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:39,580
until they're baby can swim away.
It's like a few years I believe.

474
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:42,130
So when the males come to females

475
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:45,040
and they have babies and they haven't
had sex with a male with the female,

476
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:48,700
they'll sometimes kill the babies so
that she'll have sex with them again.

477
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:53,200
It's pretty fucked up lines. Just Shit
like that to bears do shit like that too.

478
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:56,450
Yeah. That's the other thing. That
video with you in the line line.

479
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,060
What's that?
A few times on this show and freaked,

480
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:05,290
but any case I'm going to jail
for fucking good cause man,

481
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:08,140
I used to get arrested for
fucked up shit man. You know,

482
00:30:08,141 --> 00:30:12,220
like drugs and violence and Canada.

483
00:30:12,221 --> 00:30:16,450
I got arrested for violence. What kind
of, yeah, we should do. There was,

484
00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:20,930
it was a salt, like, um, the, and, and
we actually ran away from cops and,

485
00:30:20,931 --> 00:30:24,380
and God away. It was on
New Year's Eve when, uh,

486
00:30:24,670 --> 00:30:27,580
2003, I want to say it was a, uh,

487
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:32,680
it was 2003 and turning into 2004 did
this big show and some fucking asshole got

488
00:30:33,851 --> 00:30:36,290
on stage and like snuck up like whatever.

489
00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:39,670
And like sucker punched me
while I was on stage, you know,

490
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:42,070
like a fucking punching in.

491
00:30:42,071 --> 00:30:46,000
And so of course everybody grabs him and
starts beating the shit out of him and,

492
00:30:46,001 --> 00:30:48,100
and uh, and I'm like,
and I'm like, you know,

493
00:30:48,101 --> 00:30:51,830
on the microphone saying fucking kick
his ass, you know, like, you know,

494
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:54,910
trying to like tell him it
started as an assault on me,

495
00:30:54,911 --> 00:30:57,070
but by the time I was like,
Nah, I'll kick his ass.

496
00:30:57,370 --> 00:31:01,360
And they're beating them
just all blood, like, uh,

497
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:05,200
and pressing Lacey,
the big guy on jackass had his microphone.

498
00:31:05,201 --> 00:31:07,330
He was just like grading
the dude's forehead off,

499
00:31:08,810 --> 00:31:12,490
like so it was kind of bloody live from
that. And then they like, they carry them,

500
00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:13,443
uh,
you know,

501
00:31:13,570 --> 00:31:16,270
the cat and then they're carrying them
away and I'm like hauled off and kicked

502
00:31:16,271 --> 00:31:18,790
the guy, you know? And so like
you got in trouble for that.

503
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:23,530
And I did gather that the cops
were called and, um, we just,

504
00:31:23,531 --> 00:31:27,550
I think maybe like ran off the stage
and she's dipped, you know, like,

505
00:31:27,551 --> 00:31:32,300
and got away. But then I
was back, um, you know, I'm,

506
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:32,680
you know,

507
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:37,680
my new tour in a fucking I was
in is in Calgary and I'm on the,

508
00:31:37,961 --> 00:31:42,670
on the, I'm on the, uh, the morning
news promoting my shows and they said,

509
00:31:42,671 --> 00:31:46,480
have you ever been to Calgary before?
I said, oh, yeah, like I, I was,

510
00:31:46,481 --> 00:31:50,140
I was here and we really beat
the crap out of this guy.

511
00:31:50,141 --> 00:31:54,190
And then we ran from cops and got away.
So like you in Canada?

512
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:55,151
I'm Canadian.

513
00:31:55,151 --> 00:31:59,820
I have a Canadian passport and I'm also
American and I'm also British, but, uh, I,

514
00:31:59,850 --> 00:32:04,000
and my mom was born in Canada. My Dad was
born in America, I was born in England,

515
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:04,990
so I'm all three.

516
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:08,090
Well you saw all you have to do is be
born in a country like that and you get

517
00:32:08,091 --> 00:32:09,410
her citizen citizen,

518
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:13,720
then they'll allow you to be a citizen of
America to correct. Yeah. You can't be,

519
00:32:13,721 --> 00:32:17,320
you can't be, it can't be a
resident of more than one place.

520
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:19,730
It can be a citizen and all I got,

521
00:32:19,731 --> 00:32:23,650
I didn't marry like a Australian chicken
stone in New Zealand would be even

522
00:32:23,651 --> 00:32:26,650
better.
[inaudible] quadro right.

523
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:31,810
I'm triple national. The thing was though,
like I'm some bragging about like, yeah,

524
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:34,270
would beat up this guy and
fucking ran from the cops.

525
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:38,320
And then when I left that
trip hand over the passport,

526
00:32:38,321 --> 00:32:42,260
like a to the immigration
guy, like you know, going
through the airport, he's like,

527
00:32:42,261 --> 00:32:44,600
yeah,
go ahead and wait in this room

528
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:47,900
and send the yeah,

529
00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:52,070
send the cops came and
arrested me and I was in,

530
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:54,980
I mean they held me for like 12
hours or 10 hours or something.

531
00:32:55,090 --> 00:32:56,360
And what they say when they arrested you,

532
00:32:57,230 --> 00:32:59,180
they said there's where you
have an outstanding warrant,

533
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:02,720
which I think is pretty funny.
It's like an outstanding warrant.

534
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:13,670
Right.
Why did you let you go after 12 hours?

535
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:18,070
Because I paid bail like a $10,000 bail.

536
00:33:19,290 --> 00:33:22,130
You have to go back and go to court. I
mean, it was a misdemeanor, you know,

537
00:33:22,131 --> 00:33:25,820
whatever. Like I got it
sorted out from, um, you know,

538
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:29,510
like whatever Canada's and play. When it
comes to salt though, like if you can't,

539
00:33:29,511 --> 00:33:31,780
it isn't play when it comes
to anything man. Like I,

540
00:33:31,810 --> 00:33:34,640
Canada is the fucking toughest
country to get into. I mean,

541
00:33:34,641 --> 00:33:37,730
like everybody gets held up if you've
got a drunk driving arrest and you're not

542
00:33:37,731 --> 00:33:42,470
allowed in. I saw it. I don't, I don't
know if there was that big of a deal,

543
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:45,870
but, uh, but whatever, you know, it was
great because I was able to sort of,

544
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:49,160
you know,
like clear away the wreckage of my past,

545
00:33:49,161 --> 00:33:52,400
like for all the fucked up Shit I've
done. Like, I like to think I've made it.

546
00:33:52,401 --> 00:33:56,660
All right. You know, how about the dude
that got spiked on his fucking head?

547
00:33:57,470 --> 00:34:00,050
He's fine.
It's like a grand man

548
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:06,380
special k through that 50
grand the first day. That's a,

549
00:34:06,650 --> 00:34:10,010
it's, it's a weird thing like
the Canadian thing, like, um,

550
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:12,220
they live right next door to us,

551
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:16,630
so they gotta to be real careful about
like fugitives sneaking across the border.

552
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:21,220
So they're super strict about any
weirdness. Like Eddie Bravo, well,

553
00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:26,250
a long time ago got pulled over,
not even arrested for having illegal,

554
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,630
he,
he used to work for check cashing company,

555
00:34:28,810 --> 00:34:32,740
so he used to take these bags of cash
around with them and he had a concealed

556
00:34:32,741 --> 00:34:33,574
weapons permit.

557
00:34:33,910 --> 00:34:38,140
And so he gets pulled over by the
cops and he tells the cops a officer,

558
00:34:38,141 --> 00:34:43,140
I work for check cashing company, I have
a large sum of cash and I also have a, a,

559
00:34:43,170 --> 00:34:47,110
a concealed weapon. And, uh, here's,
here's my permits here, my paperwork.

560
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:50,280
And so they take them out of the car
that handcuff him, check his paperwork,

561
00:34:50,281 --> 00:34:53,020
they got everything seems in order,
you're free to go. And they let them go.

562
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:55,420
So every time he goes to Canada,

563
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:58,000
they bring up that every
time still on his record.

564
00:34:58,350 --> 00:35:01,610
And his record still on his record
in wasn't even an arrest. He pulled,

565
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:05,680
they pulled him over, they check
me. But when involves a gun,

566
00:35:05,830 --> 00:35:08,790
if it involves anything where
you like just man's cash,

567
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:12,040
everybody's pretty uptight about.
But it was, it was all legit. It was,

568
00:35:12,041 --> 00:35:13,660
he worked for check cashing company.

569
00:35:13,661 --> 00:35:17,980
So he had a total 100% iron clad excuse.
They let him out.

570
00:35:18,310 --> 00:35:21,940
I mean he never brought him to jail.
They let him go. Yeah. But still,

571
00:35:21,941 --> 00:35:23,440
every time he goes to
Canada they check him.

572
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:27,220
And James had a real hard time cause
Kevin James got in a street fight like in

573
00:35:27,221 --> 00:35:29,920
like high school or college or
something like that and got arrested.

574
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:33,940
No conviction, no nothing. But every time
that he would go to Canada, like when,

575
00:35:33,941 --> 00:35:36,880
before he was famous, we do the
Montreal comedy festival together.

576
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:38,220
Every time we'd go to Canada,

577
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:42,960
they would fuck with them. They, Australia
is the same way, man. Australia is, um,

578
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:46,650
like maybe even harder to
get into then Canada. And,

579
00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:50,880
and I'm not Australian, so
when I, when I go to Australia,

580
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:55,650
I have to, um, like fulfill.
Like with my visa application,

581
00:35:55,651 --> 00:35:59,550
I have to submit my
entire criminal record,

582
00:35:59,551 --> 00:36:03,920
like my whole history and it's like so
long. It's hilarious. Like, uh, yeah,

583
00:36:04,090 --> 00:36:06,930
I mean there's even a bunch of stuff
I didn't even mention like, you know,

584
00:36:06,931 --> 00:36:09,220
like to be getting arrested
all over the states and stuff,

585
00:36:09,221 --> 00:36:13,890
but nothing was really how many times
you've been arrested. Uh, there's one in,

586
00:36:13,891 --> 00:36:18,330
uh, in Philadelphia, like
public urination was like,

587
00:36:18,331 --> 00:36:22,640
when you kind of mellow, it was more
like funny than anything. Um, and uh,

588
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:26,330
there's my first drunk driving.
She have like,

589
00:36:26,370 --> 00:36:31,240
those look forward for five.
Right,

590
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:33,630
right, right. Counting
off the days in prison.

591
00:36:34,810 --> 00:36:37,150
Like I last year that like,
you know,

592
00:36:37,151 --> 00:36:38,430
they're like a year and
a half ago or something.

593
00:36:38,431 --> 00:36:41,430
I did a whole Australia tour
and um, you know, I was,

594
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:45,690
I was like putting it all together
and I made like a youtube video, like,

595
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:48,750
like actually going through my whole
like official thing and like with all the

596
00:36:48,751 --> 00:36:52,290
paperwork, you know, my criminal
criminal past or whatever.

597
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:57,390
And at the same time too, um, the, uh, um,

598
00:36:57,510 --> 00:37:00,750
the Australian tour promoter wanted,
um,

599
00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:04,760
need to have a name for my tour, you know,
like, oh, we'd like to have, you know,

600
00:37:04,761 --> 00:37:08,490
a name for the tour. And so I'm going
through my whole arrest history.

601
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:10,140
And so I told him,
yeah man,

602
00:37:10,141 --> 00:37:15,030
it's Steevo guilty as charged cause they
ended the name of my tour, you know.

603
00:37:15,031 --> 00:37:19,620
And so that's been the name of my tour
for like a year and a half, you know,

604
00:37:19,621 --> 00:37:22,590
like if anybody wants to know the name
of it, that's what it is every time.

605
00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:26,720
And now I'm so excited to be
here today is because, uh,

606
00:37:26,730 --> 00:37:29,400
in like less than three weeks in Austin,
Texas,

607
00:37:29,401 --> 00:37:33,120
I'm taping my first comedy
special for showtime.

608
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:36,330
And it's of course called
Steevo guilty as charged.

609
00:37:36,490 --> 00:37:41,160
Were you taping it at the paramount
theater in Austin, Texas? I've been there.

610
00:37:41,170 --> 00:37:44,430
I did it. So it's so fucking,
I mean, I just love Texas.

611
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:49,350
I love Texas so much and it's the one
place that I haven't been to with the,

612
00:37:49,351 --> 00:37:53,280
with the, with this tourist. So it's
like, oh, you have a fresh, fresh crowd,

613
00:37:53,281 --> 00:37:56,000
you know, and um, we don't doing on tour.

614
00:37:56,010 --> 00:37:59,390
You doing street stand up with it.
It's,

615
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:04,540
it's like a one man show where
like, uh, it's totally standup.

616
00:38:04,590 --> 00:38:09,150
It's totally stories and like on
story points throughout the show,

617
00:38:09,450 --> 00:38:14,310
like I do like super fucked up
stones, you know, like what, like,

618
00:38:14,311 --> 00:38:15,960
uh,
I mean when,

619
00:38:15,961 --> 00:38:20,550
when I come in like I'm
gonna like blast fucking, uh,

620
00:38:20,610 --> 00:38:23,280
like a 12 pack of soda cans on my head,
you know,

621
00:38:23,281 --> 00:38:27,320
like until they're all like
busted it open. What? Yeah.

622
00:38:29,090 --> 00:38:30,370
You just take the candidate,

623
00:38:30,371 --> 00:38:34,430
it's not open and you just fucking
keep smashing it in your head. So,

624
00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:39,700
and it's sort, it's going to be showed
up with all the lights, you know,

625
00:38:39,701 --> 00:38:42,190
like all the lights and then
when, once it was, once it breaks,

626
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:47,290
it's like spraying like super fucking
a lot, you know? And so it looked out,

627
00:38:47,291 --> 00:38:51,970
man, I'll break like at least six. Um,
and uh, and then, um, whenever like,

628
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:55,420
you know, don't look so healthy
for someone who's done so much,

629
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:01,030
I can walk normal. Yeah. You seem
to be your voice. A little raspy,

630
00:39:01,031 --> 00:39:05,290
but everything's coming out good.
I appreciate it dude.

631
00:39:06,910 --> 00:39:11,120
But yeah, then like whatever,
at the top of my show I like,

632
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:13,960
I got some crowd work and stuff like,
um,

633
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:18,120
and I don't even waste any time before I
started fucking bagging on Carlos, man.

um, you know, ladies clap.

637
00:39:29,531 --> 00:39:32,350

pic from someone, you know,

638

and it's like really like, it's

the back and forth with, you know,

641
00:39:43,451 --> 00:39:46,600
it's just really fucking funny
and to pull like, you know,

642
00:39:46,601 --> 00:39:50,320
now like what kind of Dick Pics did you
get from guys that you weren't hooking

643
00:39:50,321 --> 00:39:51,020
up with?
You know,

644
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:54,610
like now clap if you've got a dick pic
from a guy that you were not hooking up

645
00:39:54,611 --> 00:39:58,660
with it all and like, look less, but
still a ton. That chick's clubbing came.

646
00:39:58,661 --> 00:40:01,900
Now I get a clap really loud if you
went on to have sex with that guy,

647
00:40:02,210 --> 00:40:06,220

like, so it doesn't work, you know?

648
00:40:06,221 --> 00:40:07,990
And then I have to, I'd
tell him like, you know,

649
00:40:07,991 --> 00:40:12,520
and I just saw this thing recently and
so I just started doing it like, um,

650
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:17,170
uh, say, uh, you know, I saw
this funny thing I about Dick
Pics and it was so funny.

651
00:40:17,171 --> 00:40:21,820
I stole it, you know, it was one of
these memes where a girl is saying,

652
00:40:22,090 --> 00:40:25,720
receiving a dick pic from a guy who's
just like her cat bringing her a dead

653
00:40:25,721 --> 00:40:30,520
mouse says she says,
I can see that you are very proud

654
00:40:32,410 --> 00:40:36,970
but I'm not touching it.
Right. And like lyric,

655
00:40:38,290 --> 00:40:43,060
that's fucking fun. And people will
like actually clap, you know? And I say,

656
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:47,980
and I still like every time I'm like, oh
my God, I can't fucking like this floors.

657
00:40:48,010 --> 00:40:52,840
Me Getting applause for a
joke I told you I stole.

658
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:54,940
I said Fuck,
I love this so much.

659
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:59,590
I decided I'm going to do a whole
fucking bit just out of jokes. I stole,

660
00:40:59,830 --> 00:41:04,830
I call it the Carlos men see a bit so
that I just say really quick because I

661
00:41:05,201 --> 00:41:08,170
don't like to fucking, I don't even,
I'm not even comfortable doing this,

662
00:41:08,470 --> 00:41:11,890
but I'm like, I'll tell you two jokes
when you've heard of when you haven't,

663
00:41:12,010 --> 00:41:12,970
but I've stolen both

664
00:41:16,590 --> 00:41:19,320
here with Greg. He's doing,
I don't want to ruin it.

665
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:23,260
I want people to come to Austin so much.
Cause like normally I do comedy clubs,

666
00:41:23,261 --> 00:41:27,910
you know, and I saw the lines share my
tickets, like once I get there, you know,

667
00:41:27,911 --> 00:41:29,850
I don't do a lot of advanced ticket sales.

668
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:32,500
I show up and I get on the radio
and people are like, oh, he's here.

669
00:41:32,501 --> 00:41:35,930
And then I do great. You know,
I like, I do really well,

670
00:41:36,590 --> 00:41:40,710
but in this case for, and it's

at the paramount theater in Austin.

672
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:47,450
Like I don't have the luxury of waiting
to get there to fucking sell tickets

673
00:41:47,451 --> 00:41:49,900
because it's a fucking showtime
comedy special. You know,

my whole fucking equilibrium was off.
And I was like,

688
00:42:38,791 --> 00:42:41,100
I've got to stop hitting
myself in the fucking head,

689
00:42:41,101 --> 00:42:43,110
but yet you're going to do it
again. I'm going to do it. But yeah,

690
00:42:43,111 --> 00:42:44,340
that's the only two shows

691
00:42:45,850 --> 00:42:49,620
I was doing it like all the time you
doing it like Wednesday, Thursday,

692
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:54,470
I'm doing it. I'm doing it. Right, right,
right, right. Exactly. By the time Sunday.

693
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:59,400
Fucking totally. But yes. So any case,

694
00:42:59,401 --> 00:43:03,510
I'll be smashing the cans. I do like
that, you know, got like a couple of bits,

695
00:43:03,511 --> 00:43:05,880
like with the crowd work and
then the fucking, you know,

696
00:43:05,881 --> 00:43:08,850
by the time I'll even tell you the judge
said, I'm fucking thing. They're funny.

697
00:43:08,851 --> 00:43:12,350
They're the ones I stall for the
Carlos men see it. But if you do that,

698
00:43:12,351 --> 00:43:14,660
then the people, you're right,
you're right, you're right.

699
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:20,080
Thank you Joe. They listen, they
remember, they write shit down. Right.

700
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:30,820
Thank you Joe. But, um, but then like,
you know, after, after that, okay,

701
00:43:30,821 --> 00:43:35,290
now I'm gonna really get into it. And
so it's sort of like a, I started off,

702
00:43:36,330 --> 00:43:39,880
uh, you know, addressing like how
people have asked me for so long. Like,

703
00:43:39,881 --> 00:43:44,060
how did I get into it? How to Jack has,
she had start and, uh, you know, I,

704
00:43:44,061 --> 00:43:48,190
I give like a super condensed,
like super hilarious, uh,

705
00:43:48,490 --> 00:43:52,090
like sort of fucking genesis
story. Like, you know,

706
00:43:52,091 --> 00:43:56,320
starting with like me and high school
and getting caught dealing drugs and you

707
00:43:56,321 --> 00:43:58,840
know, like, and, uh, you know,

708
00:43:58,841 --> 00:44:02,930
legs going to college and just
fucking up royally. I mean,

709
00:44:02,931 --> 00:44:07,870
I've fucked up royally it in college
and a college. It was so bad.

710
00:44:07,990 --> 00:44:11,170
Well, within two weeks of class,
starting my freshman year, I was,

711
00:44:11,470 --> 00:44:15,040
I was on final disciplinary probation,
which is fucking impressed.

712
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:18,460
Two weeks I got my room rated
like, uh, you know, they,

713
00:44:18,490 --> 00:44:23,230
they've found alcohol and weed
and shit and said like, you know,

714
00:44:23,231 --> 00:44:27,730
so they relocated me into another
fucking dorm, you know, and they're like,

715
00:44:27,731 --> 00:44:29,950
you are on final disciplinary probation.

716
00:44:30,370 --> 00:44:34,500
And like I climbed up like that broke
out a window and climbed onto the roof.

717
00:44:34,790 --> 00:44:35,550
You know,

718
00:44:35,550 --> 00:44:38,940
there's a radio tower on top of the
roof and I climbed up that and someone

719
00:44:38,941 --> 00:44:40,340
spotted me from the ground and,

720
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:45,300
and said the cops came on the roof and
they kicked me out of the dorms and I was

721
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:47,670
failing the fuck out of my classes.

722
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:52,290
And then I just got in a van with this
dude and just took off without him

723
00:44:52,291 --> 00:44:55,170
withdrawing. So, so,

724
00:44:55,171 --> 00:44:59,510
so I got a in a van with
this deal never ends.

725
00:44:59,570 --> 00:45:02,730
Well I got,
I failed out,

726
00:45:02,731 --> 00:45:06,980
I got kicked out and I dropped out.
Oh my gosh. I call it overachieving.

727
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:11,420
Fucked up that at all. I know. And like,
that's the thing, it's like, you know,

728
00:45:11,430 --> 00:45:14,280
people were like, when I was leaving
the University of Miami, it's like,

729
00:45:14,281 --> 00:45:15,840
well what are you going to do now?
And I'm like,

730
00:45:15,850 --> 00:45:18,330
I'm going to fucking video tape
fucked up shit. And I'm going to,

731
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:23,750
I'm going to be [inaudible] 93 so
you had this idea in 93 Oh yeah,

732
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:29,340
I was. And even then I was like, man,
like I had like special fucking skills,

733
00:45:29,341 --> 00:45:31,320
you know,
like I had like,

734
00:45:31,890 --> 00:45:34,700
I was really fucking good
at drinking bong water,

735
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:38,640
didn't care, I'm working. It was

736
00:45:41,370 --> 00:45:44,760
very much people, louvers said, I
don't even care how murky it was

737
00:45:46,750 --> 00:45:50,810
a whole life never comes out of
your mouth. I live a good life. And,

738
00:45:50,811 --> 00:45:54,310
and like I was like, you know, it
was Miami, so I was like super,

739
00:45:54,970 --> 00:45:58,320
like I would like blow off class and
I'd be like practicing jumping on the

740
00:45:58,321 --> 00:46:02,460
diving boards at the, at the pool. And
I'm like, I'm never going to be a diver.

741
00:46:02,461 --> 00:46:06,600
But if I had jumped strictly off of like
roofs of like apartment buildings and

742
00:46:06,601 --> 00:46:10,410
shit into shallow pools, then
it's bad at. So I was like,

743
00:46:10,411 --> 00:46:12,450
I got pretty good at that.
Oh my God.

744
00:46:12,451 --> 00:46:17,451
Like my specialty was like setting
myself on fire with like hairspray and

745
00:46:18,001 --> 00:46:18,834
rubbing alcohol.

746
00:46:19,050 --> 00:46:23,370
And so at the point where I'm not even
like fucking five minutes into the show

747
00:46:23,371 --> 00:46:27,660
at this point and I had to say my
specialty was setting myself on fire with

748
00:46:27,661 --> 00:46:29,010
hairspray and rubbing alcohol.

749
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:33,360
So I'm going to at that point
demonstrate like it's gamma.

750
00:46:33,361 --> 00:46:35,970
Do you like that in the
theater they let you go to,

751
00:46:35,990 --> 00:46:39,540
I used to do in comedy clubs all the time
but I kept getting so hurt like I just

752
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:41,310
fucking,
you know like,

753
00:46:41,740 --> 00:46:46,650
like cause cause what I do is like I
may do like kind of a deluxe version for

754
00:46:46,651 --> 00:46:49,170
this one. Like I'm going to start
with like a can of hairspray.

755
00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:53,100
I'm going to like spray and my like all
the hair on my head like heavily with

756
00:46:53,101 --> 00:46:55,410
the hairspray.
I'm going to climb on top of a,

757
00:46:55,411 --> 00:46:58,380
of a table on the stage and Dallas,

758
00:46:58,381 --> 00:47:00,720
my arm with rubbing alcohol,

759
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:05,480
fill my mouth with lamp oil
and then we're going to bottle

760
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:10,710
flute. Never seen, not that. Then
I'm going to click on a click,

761
00:47:10,711 --> 00:47:13,000
a lighter and light my arm on fire.

762
00:47:13,060 --> 00:47:16,860
Like just the rubbing alcohol and
my skin all the way up to your hair.

763
00:47:16,910 --> 00:47:21,210
Well like a drop will like from when I
pour it like on the table there'll be a

764
00:47:21,211 --> 00:47:22,620
puddle and so like a drop,

765
00:47:22,621 --> 00:47:26,100
we'll stay on fire probably and then
it's to the table will be on fire.

766
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:29,580
My arm's on fire and then like,
so I'm going to my arms,

767
00:47:29,590 --> 00:47:34,590
a torch when I do a front flip standing
on top of the table and simultaneously

768
00:47:34,781 --> 00:47:39,130
as I do the front flip blow of fireball,
like off of my arm,

769
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:42,430
like which is a huge with lamp lamp oil.
It goes crazy.

770
00:47:42,431 --> 00:47:46,930
So like the lamp oil and as I'm flipping
from like the front flip my head,

771
00:47:46,931 --> 00:47:48,760
like everything just goes
right through the fire.

772
00:47:48,761 --> 00:47:53,110
So when I crash on the table on my bag,
now my head's on fire.

773
00:47:53,111 --> 00:47:55,570
And so then I get get up
and like kind of like,

774
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:59,930
like flail around the stage with my head
on fire and my buddy comes riding out

775
00:47:59,950 --> 00:48:04,060
with a mouthful of lamp oil and he comes
running up to me and he uses my head as

776
00:48:04,061 --> 00:48:06,520
a torch and just,
you know,

777
00:48:06,521 --> 00:48:10,660
it blows a fucking huge
fireball off of my head. And uh,

778
00:48:10,661 --> 00:48:14,380
and then like we'll figure out
how to put me out, you know,

779
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:16,460
then we'll figure it out.
Right, right. And He,

780
00:48:16,461 --> 00:48:20,170
maybe he'll have like a towel or
something because I've gotten like a towel

781
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:25,930
fire me. No, I mean I
wouldn't do that. I'll go on,

782
00:48:25,931 --> 00:48:27,970
like my goal will be to
disease my bare hands,

783
00:48:28,170 --> 00:48:30,250
but does the thing is like
I've done it where I'd hold it,

784
00:48:30,251 --> 00:48:32,250
you're going to do this?
Oh No. Oh fuck dude.

785
00:48:33,510 --> 00:48:37,400
[inaudible]
yeah.

786
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:41,560
Oh my God, I didn't think about it cause
I remember like, wouldn't think about it.

787
00:48:41,620 --> 00:48:45,280
Well, I mean it's just theater.
Like, I thought I didn't,

788
00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:49,240
it didn't occur to me that they would
find out that I was going to do it until I

789
00:48:49,241 --> 00:48:53,500
already did it. A million plus
people are going to hear this.

790
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:56,680
Someone's going to tell
him, well, all right,

791
00:48:56,681 --> 00:48:58,690
well then fucking I better figure it out.

792
00:49:00,150 --> 00:49:04,030
I'll come agent guarantee how fire Katia,
I've done,

793
00:49:04,060 --> 00:49:07,360
I've done it in the fucking thousand
places I've ever let anybody know

794
00:49:07,361 --> 00:49:08,770
beforehand on a podcast.

795
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:12,470
I feel like a fucking
flashback from Calgary coming.

796
00:49:15,330 --> 00:49:17,800
It's like all the times you've hit
yourself in the head with sodas you've

797
00:49:17,860 --> 00:49:20,600
knocked out.
They used to be planning

798
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:28,460
segment of your brain that's just
shorted out like a bad fuse lodge.

799
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:33,400
You won't figure it out. I got maybe
we'll have like a bunch of people with,

800
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:34,810
with a fire extinguisher.

801
00:49:35,710 --> 00:49:40,000
Definitely have a bunch of people let
the lens of Fucking Fire Marshal No.

802
00:49:40,001 --> 00:49:42,970
Or whatever. Do a bed like this is
so important, man. I have to do it.

803
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:46,630
Aren't you scared that like maybe you
get really injured and you can't finish?

804
00:49:46,690 --> 00:49:51,690
I mean like one time I like
burned my neck really bad and um,

805
00:49:52,420 --> 00:49:56,170
it hurts, but it's not going
to like stop me, you know? Wow.

806
00:49:56,340 --> 00:49:59,260
Like half the rest of your show
could be you looking, you know,

807
00:49:59,261 --> 00:50:02,600
like steam coming off
your face first time.

808
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:05,350
That'll be a real problem.

809
00:50:06,570 --> 00:50:11,350
It's like this part of the
fun all fucked up. Yeah.

810
00:50:11,530 --> 00:50:15,970
I mean I think it's whatever. I mean the,
the, the crazier, the better, you know,

811
00:50:15,971 --> 00:50:17,010
like, uh, I'm, I'm,

812
00:50:17,011 --> 00:50:21,510
I'm in this fucking really make
an impression it's going to,

813
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:24,300
it's going to go on and there's
just gonna be like, it's sort of,

814
00:50:24,301 --> 00:50:27,580
it's kind of a one man show.
But the thing is like, I, it's,

815
00:50:27,581 --> 00:50:31,110
it's also like fully stand up, man.
I've been on tour doing standup

816
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:34,670
for five years now. Yeah. I remember when
you first started doing it. I was like,

817
00:50:34,671 --> 00:50:35,161
that's it.
Cause you,

818
00:50:35,161 --> 00:50:37,700
you first started doing it like right
around the time when you're getting sober.

819
00:50:37,701 --> 00:50:38,400
Right.

820
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:43,400
I had been sober for like two years
when I really dove into it and that was,

821
00:50:43,971 --> 00:50:46,970
I wasn't sober yet when I first
started. Oh, you weren't? Yeah,

822
00:50:46,971 --> 00:50:51,800
first time I tried it was 2006. Oh, okay.
So you took a break and then came back.

823
00:50:52,220 --> 00:50:56,270
Just dabbled in it heavy until I'd
been sober for a couple of years.

824
00:50:56,300 --> 00:51:00,740
But that's pretty much what you do now.
Pretty much. Yeah. Now as being sober,

825
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:04,430
does that fuck with your ability
to do a lot of these crazy stunts?

826
00:51:05,170 --> 00:51:07,840
Well, obviously not, you
know, I would say that, uh,

827
00:51:09,210 --> 00:51:11,390
I mean if you're like sober,
like

828
00:51:13,060 --> 00:51:17,680
deliberately hurting herself isn't
necessarily easier, but it's like,

829
00:51:17,770 --> 00:51:21,190
I never did that because you
know, I, because I was wasted.

830
00:51:21,191 --> 00:51:24,760
I did it because I'm an attention whore
and sober and not take away the drugs

831
00:51:24,761 --> 00:51:27,160
and alcohol. I'm still an
attention whore, you know?

832
00:51:27,580 --> 00:51:29,460
But you embrace the clock he had.

833
00:51:29,610 --> 00:51:34,090
Why do you think I have a fucking
tattoo of myself on my back? You know,

834
00:51:34,091 --> 00:51:37,690
like everybody's favorite
topic of conversation isn't
themselves. I'm just like,

835
00:51:37,780 --> 00:51:40,480
I think that's hilarious and I'm
cool with admitting it, you know?

836
00:51:41,190 --> 00:51:45,750
But it just seems like if you were fucked
up on drugs and you made this career

837
00:51:45,780 --> 00:51:50,580
of like getting hammered and going out
and doing wild crazy stunts that got you

838
00:51:50,581 --> 00:51:54,020
injured and then you cut out the
getting fucked up part. Right.

839
00:51:54,060 --> 00:51:56,560
But you're still injuring yourself.
I mean,

840
00:51:56,670 --> 00:52:01,670
injury. My Saab isn't as, as it isn't
like isn't as much of it, you know?

841
00:52:01,671 --> 00:52:05,690
I mean, sure, I'll still do it. I don't
carry mine injured you've ever gotten.

842
00:52:06,380 --> 00:52:11,380
I threw myself off a balcony
at the University of Miami
after I dropped out and

843
00:52:12,711 --> 00:52:17,160
then I came back and just lived there
even though I wasn't allowed to. Uh,

844
00:52:17,220 --> 00:52:22,220
and there's like a keg party and I was
trying to like impress this fat chick and

845
00:52:22,251 --> 00:52:23,200
I was on the thousand,

846
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:28,080
but I had taken too many pills and drank
too much booze and I'm telling them,

847
00:52:28,090 --> 00:52:32,240
this girl, this was in,
uh, I think it was January,

848
00:52:32,270 --> 00:52:35,540
January of 1995 and I'm telling this girl,
I said,

849
00:52:35,541 --> 00:52:40,100
I'm going to be like a fucking Super Rad
stunt man and we're on the second floor

850
00:52:40,101 --> 00:52:43,280
balcony. I tell her like,
you know, like, okay,

851
00:52:43,281 --> 00:52:46,580
like I'm going to be like this fucking
gnarly stunt man. Like picture this,

852
00:52:46,581 --> 00:52:50,210
like imagine like, like there's a
fight on the balcony. You right.

853
00:52:50,211 --> 00:52:53,450
And like I get punched and I'm like
pretending I get punched and I just throw

854
00:52:53,451 --> 00:52:57,770
myself off the balcony. Now.
I used to throw myself off
of balconies all the time,

855
00:52:58,100 --> 00:53:01,400
but not when I was at fucked up and not
when I was trying to pretend that I had

856
00:53:01,401 --> 00:53:02,181
been punched.

857
00:53:02,181 --> 00:53:06,470
And so I'm like holding my whole game
plan where like the way I would do it,

858
00:53:06,471 --> 00:53:09,830
I did did it different. I
didn't catch the bottom, uh,

859
00:53:09,831 --> 00:53:12,050
with my hand and then let myself go.

860
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:16,070
I just spun over the railing and so I
spun over the railing and Linda let me

861
00:53:16,071 --> 00:53:20,120
fucking face on the bottom of, and
I broke, I broke, I have a cat,

862
00:53:20,121 --> 00:53:23,570
scans are so gnarly.
Like I broke my cheekbone,

863
00:53:23,990 --> 00:53:27,480
a broke 17th,
I had 10 stitches in my chin,

864
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:29,580
a concussion and a broken wrist.

865
00:53:30,090 --> 00:53:35,090
And that's actually pretty
good considering you fell
onto what concrete and I

866
00:53:36,091 --> 00:53:40,020
was landing that landed there. And I was
fucking face down from where I'm from,

867
00:53:40,021 --> 00:53:44,370
where I needed the 10 stitches. I had
like a, a pool of blood, like growing.

868
00:53:44,430 --> 00:53:48,750
I was face down and I'm not even
fucking twitch and a finger at all.

869
00:53:48,751 --> 00:53:51,910
I'm going to just like, there's
just blood pooling, you know, and,

870
00:53:51,911 --> 00:53:55,380
and I'm not moving and everyone's like,
thinks I'm probably dead.

871
00:53:55,980 --> 00:53:59,460
But my buddies were like, they're
like, man, if he's not dead,

872
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:04,500
he's going to need that weed in his
pockets. I had like, I had like, kind,

873
00:54:04,501 --> 00:54:05,350
we'd, you know, like,

874
00:54:05,430 --> 00:54:09,960
like fucking proper good
weed in one pocket and like
swag weed and the other and,

875
00:54:10,230 --> 00:54:14,490
and they, uh, you know, I'd pull
it out, pull it out and, and um,

876
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:17,160
and in the morning I knew my mom was like,

877
00:54:17,161 --> 00:54:20,220
I didn't remember even remember landing,
like, I don't remember anything, you know,

878
00:54:20,221 --> 00:54:23,010
and they called the ambulance,
whatever. And it came and, um,

879
00:54:24,230 --> 00:54:27,990
and then in the morning,
like I woke up and I was so fucked up.

880
00:54:27,991 --> 00:54:28,824
It was unbelievable.

881
00:54:28,830 --> 00:54:33,110
But I knew my mom was on a cruise
ship in the Caribbean but I,

882
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:36,720
but I told them, I said, oh, I need to
call my mom. And they said, of course.

883
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:40,440
But what I did was I called my buddies
down at the University of Miami. I said,

884
00:54:40,441 --> 00:54:40,860
hey,

885
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:45,860
I'm going to fucking leave out the
fucking emergency room entrance right now.

886
00:54:46,291 --> 00:54:49,530
Come scoop me up and said I
broke out of the hospital in my,

887
00:54:49,830 --> 00:54:54,540
in my gown and they came and picked me
up and I went back to the spot and I

888
00:54:54,541 --> 00:54:59,541
stood like right over like the pool of
blood and had tried to pound a beer but I

889
00:55:00,811 --> 00:55:04,590
couldn't because it hurts you that
and I couldn't eat or anything.

890
00:55:04,591 --> 00:55:05,170
And I was like,

891
00:55:05,170 --> 00:55:09,200
like my sinuses would like fill with
blood and then I would like hockey and you

892
00:55:09,201 --> 00:55:12,570
know like you hock a Lougie
and Acog and then spit it out.

893
00:55:12,570 --> 00:55:14,640
And it was just blood
Louise for like two weeks.

894
00:55:14,820 --> 00:55:17,940
I tried to eat apple sauce and I couldn't
even fucking eat apple applesauce

895
00:55:17,941 --> 00:55:20,790
cause I was so busted up.
And so the apple sauce,

896
00:55:20,850 --> 00:55:24,750
a bowl of applesauce sat next to
my bed is with blood, Louise in it.

897
00:55:25,860 --> 00:55:30,780
I just used it as a spitter.
Yeah. And I had like,

898
00:55:31,050 --> 00:55:33,350
I had a,
I broke my wrist too.

899
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:38,070
And so I had the cast on my wrist for like
whatever you have it on for six weeks.

900
00:55:38,370 --> 00:55:41,250
And my mom likes sort of
felt bad for me because my,

901
00:55:41,540 --> 00:55:43,650
my broke 70th and so my fucking,

902
00:55:43,651 --> 00:55:47,430
all my front teeth are all busted out
and she knew I was a fuck up, you know,

903
00:55:47,431 --> 00:55:50,730
which teeth like got it
was, it was uh, like my,

904
00:55:50,731 --> 00:55:55,731
my front one of my front ones and then
there was one that didn't break in.

905
00:55:56,120 --> 00:56:00,170
The one on the other side of that one did
break. So it looked extra bad, you know,

906
00:56:00,660 --> 00:56:05,580
like right. And, um, and, and my mom like
felt bad for me. She likes sorta had like,

907
00:56:05,581 --> 00:56:09,150
you know, she felt bad for me and you
know, she's conserving enabler too.

908
00:56:09,151 --> 00:56:13,920
So she said a dentist appointment for
me to get my teeth fixed, you know,

909
00:56:13,921 --> 00:56:17,810
like, and she's going to pay for it. And
I'd still got the cast on my wrist and,

910
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:22,200
and the night before the fucking dentist
appointment or I'm going to get my

911
00:56:22,590 --> 00:56:27,490
teeth fixed is when I get fucking
arrested for my first drunk driving,

912
00:56:27,970 --> 00:56:28,810
you know,
and like,

913
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:33,840
and so they fucking take me into a Miami
Dade fucking county jail and I'm in the

914
00:56:34,841 --> 00:56:39,640
holding cell there and one of the
fucking like correctional officers in the

915
00:56:39,641 --> 00:56:40,091
jail,

916
00:56:40,091 --> 00:56:45,091
it's in my fucking cast and says
that cast is a potential weapon,

917
00:56:46,540 --> 00:56:50,980
you know, like, cause they like, uh, like
if I get into a fight in the holding cell,

918
00:56:50,981 --> 00:56:55,300
now I'm going to have an unfair advantage
because I've got this cast on my arm.

919
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:58,300
So they're like, hey, you can't
be in this fucking holding cell.

920
00:56:58,450 --> 00:57:03,450
You have to go in to this gnarly
fucking like a crazy fucking,

921
00:57:04,060 --> 00:57:04,541
you know,

922
00:57:04,541 --> 00:57:07,990
and so with like all the people are in
here for the longest stretch of time.

923
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:10,000
Oh God. You know. And they said,

924
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:13,510
the first thing I had to do was
go and take a photo, get naked,

925
00:57:13,511 --> 00:57:16,990
and take a fucking shower in the back of
this big sell with all these bunk beds

926
00:57:16,991 --> 00:57:21,250
and all these fucking creepy households.
And, uh, I'm like, this sucks man.

927
00:57:21,670 --> 00:57:26,320
I called my mom and I was
like, mom, you know, like, you
know, I'm in jail, you know,

928
00:57:26,321 --> 00:57:30,780
and she's like, she's like, you've
what? You know, like she, she says, ah,

929
00:57:30,781 --> 00:57:35,410
I'm not bailing you out unless you
go door to door straight to rehab.

930
00:57:35,710 --> 00:57:40,700
And I'm like, okay. So I went
to rehab like in 1995. And,

931
00:57:40,710 --> 00:57:44,940
and um, I remember these
fucking guys like, uh,

932
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:47,860
the one of the counselor says
like a, yeah, you know, like,

933
00:57:47,861 --> 00:57:49,900
I'm 95% of all alcoholics.

934
00:57:49,901 --> 00:57:54,610
I died drunk of causes related directly
to alcoholism. You know, like most people,

935
00:57:54,611 --> 00:57:58,120
like, they don't get sober, you know,
like, and I'm sitting there thinking, man,

936
00:57:58,510 --> 00:58:01,240
this guy's telling me, like, if I
had like really wanting to get sober,

937
00:58:01,241 --> 00:58:04,720
I got a 5% chance. I'm
like, fuck that, you know?

938
00:58:05,710 --> 00:58:09,430
So I stayed loaded. Like I just
resigned myself to being loaded forever.

939
00:58:09,431 --> 00:58:13,030
And it wasn't until like 13 years later,
I've suddenly got,

940
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:17,740
so him seeing that sort of all to me
fucking wasted. But what it did really,

941
00:58:17,741 --> 00:58:18,190
what it,

942
00:58:18,190 --> 00:58:23,190
what it did was it just made me not like
a get sober until I was really ready.

943
00:58:24,191 --> 00:58:28,600
You know? I think it was conveyed.
You really ready. Well, I mean fuck,

944
00:58:28,601 --> 00:58:33,310
I got like Knoxville pulled
an intervention on me and
like, uh, that's when,

945
00:58:33,311 --> 00:58:37,740
you know, you're fucked up.
But I knew how upset I was.

946
00:58:37,750 --> 00:58:41,020
One of my oldest. Yeah. You know,

947
00:58:41,021 --> 00:58:44,420
you've got a problem when that's
your interventionists, you know. Ah,

948
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:46,420
what was going on that he had to step in?
Well,

949
00:58:46,421 --> 00:58:50,200
I had this like fucking massive
mass email thing and I was like,

950
00:58:50,201 --> 00:58:54,970
broadcasting my downward spiral
and like fucking real time to like,

951
00:58:54,971 --> 00:58:57,470
you know, 200 of the most like, you know,

952
00:58:57,550 --> 00:59:00,760
influential fucking people in
the entertainment industry whose,

953
00:59:01,060 --> 00:59:04,210
who had the misfortune of
giving me their info, you know,

954
00:59:04,540 --> 00:59:08,660
and it was just like more fucked up and
it's kept getting worse and worse. And,

955
00:59:09,220 --> 00:59:10,053
and um,

956
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:15,650
and I got arrested for like
a felony cocaine possession.

957
00:59:15,700 --> 00:59:20,530
There was another one of my fucking
arrests. Felony cocaine possession.

958
00:59:20,530 --> 00:59:23,850
You have, so there's no such thing
as misdemeanor cocaine possession.

959
00:59:23,860 --> 00:59:28,010
I don't even like a little bit. You got a
little, yeah, that's a felony. Yeah. Um,

960
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:32,120
but, uh, I got evicted, I got,
you know, arrested and you know,

961
00:59:32,121 --> 00:59:34,410
like this is when I had like my,

962
00:59:34,420 --> 00:59:38,570
my neighbor in this apartment building
I lived in was always calling the cops

963
00:59:38,571 --> 00:59:40,130
because I deserved it.

964
00:59:40,910 --> 00:59:45,170
Like he was a lawyer and I'm like an
asphalt and I'm always making all this

965
00:59:45,171 --> 00:59:46,730
noise to,
the cops are always coming.

966
00:59:46,970 --> 00:59:49,910
But typically they would get
to my apartment and they'd
be stoked. It'd be like,

967
00:59:49,940 --> 00:59:53,290
oh no, wait Steve, oh, cool man. Have
a good night. And so like they would,

968
00:59:53,670 --> 00:59:58,230
so they would take off, you know, they
would play knights and they'll go, yeah,

969
00:59:58,530 --> 01:00:02,510
but this guy's just fucking, his
life was, was misery because of me.

970
01:00:02,511 --> 01:00:06,080
But the thing was that like, because
I was such a fucking, you know,

971
01:00:06,350 --> 01:00:10,640
loaded ass hole, I'm Tom, I fucking
drugs and fucking being wasted.

972
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:15,950
I was just became particularly mad at
him for always calling the cops on me.

973
01:00:16,220 --> 01:00:19,340
So like I'd like fucking
take like a baseball bat,

974
01:00:19,460 --> 01:00:23,930
like powered his door or whatever. Like
fuck you call the cops, you know, like,

975
01:00:24,820 --> 01:00:28,160
and uh, and I was like, I was
in pound. I was like, you know,

976
01:00:28,700 --> 01:00:33,050
I was like pounding on the
wall that separated our
apartment's like all the time.

977
01:00:33,051 --> 01:00:36,140
It's like, how do you like that
Fucker, you know, how do you like that?

978
01:00:36,350 --> 01:00:41,240
And a pounded on the wall so hard that I
fucking actually pounded a hole through

979
01:00:41,510 --> 01:00:46,350
the wall where I'm looking into his
apartment eight and got C's apartment.

980
01:00:46,351 --> 01:00:51,320
You look inside. I punched, I
was looking into, well, I mean,

981
01:00:52,590 --> 01:00:52,821
well,

982
01:00:52,821 --> 01:00:56,780
the thing was that I pounded enough and
then I took a broomstick and fucking

983
01:00:57,170 --> 01:01:01,250
just pounded and pounded and pounded
until I got through, you know, so now he,

984
01:01:01,251 --> 01:01:05,910
he calls the cops and they
actually have to arrest me for, uh,

985
01:01:06,230 --> 01:01:10,790
for, uh, for whatever fucking vandalism,
you know, like it was a misdemeanor,

986
01:01:10,791 --> 01:01:14,330
but I've been, I've now vandalized his
property but pounding through the wall.

987
01:01:14,570 --> 01:01:17,720
So they come to arrest me and this time
it doesn't matter if they're stoked or

988
01:01:17,721 --> 01:01:19,260
whatever, like, you know, and,

989
01:01:19,261 --> 01:01:23,150
and I'm so blown out on fucking ketamine
and I don't know what's going on.

990
01:01:23,151 --> 01:01:27,890
And I got fucking bag of
cocaine in my pocket and like,

991
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:32,150
and I'm, and I open up the
door. Like, I bet I'm shirtless.

992
01:01:32,151 --> 01:01:36,590
I have no shoes on and a bag of cocaine
in my pocket. And I'm out of my mind.

993
01:01:36,591 --> 01:01:37,251
And they're like,
hey,

994
01:01:37,251 --> 01:01:41,330
we're taking me into jail because we
have to arrest you for, for a vandalism.

995
01:01:41,780 --> 01:01:45,380
And I'm like,
it's going to be cold.

996
01:01:45,381 --> 01:01:46,850
And so I'd like as a courtesy,

997
01:01:46,860 --> 01:01:50,840
like you can go in there and put on a
shirt and put on some shoes and I'm like

998
01:01:50,841 --> 01:01:53,900
fuck shirt and fucks
her. She's, meanwhile,

999
01:01:54,080 --> 01:01:58,100
that would have been like the
perfect opportunity for me to go in,

1000
01:01:58,250 --> 01:02:02,600
take the bag of cocaine out of
my pocket and I put on, you know,

1001
01:02:02,601 --> 01:02:05,780
like it was a perfect opportunity,
but I'm like, fuck that, you know,

1002
01:02:05,930 --> 01:02:10,820
so they take me to jail with no shirt,
no shoes and a fucking,

1003
01:02:11,180 --> 01:02:13,820
and I get reared. They'd go
into your property, you know,

1004
01:02:13,821 --> 01:02:17,390
then when they process you into jail and
so they pull out a bag of cocaine and

1005
01:02:17,391 --> 01:02:22,030
they, they, they rearrest me
at the jail. Oh my God, I'm in.

1006
01:02:23,250 --> 01:02:27,600
So I'm in there for like three days or
something and it's on the news and the

1007
01:02:27,601 --> 01:02:29,160
apartment buildings fucking over me.

1008
01:02:29,161 --> 01:02:32,050
Even though I rented for apartments
in the building. One was,

1009
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:33,990
one was a skate park,

1010
01:02:43,910 --> 01:02:44,743
one,
one,

1011
01:02:47,900 --> 01:02:49,600
one was a Skatepark, one was, it's

1012
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:50,660
sort of like my,
my,

1013
01:02:50,900 --> 01:02:54,830
my body's like the one my one guy
edited my videos and stuff is kind of an

1014
01:02:54,831 --> 01:02:55,664
office.

1015
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:59,960
Had this like assistant and check
it just such a fucking joke.

1016
01:02:59,961 --> 01:03:03,860
I mean her job was just to tell people
that she couldn't find me and [inaudible]

1017
01:03:05,590 --> 01:03:09,950
had constantly change my flights
because I would always miss my flights,

1018
01:03:09,951 --> 01:03:13,190
you know? Uh, she was
like travel agent at best,

1019
01:03:13,191 --> 01:03:15,950
but I buy had an apartment for her
and then I had my bachelor pad,

1020
01:03:15,951 --> 01:03:19,280
so it was four and still
the fucking apartments,

1021
01:03:19,281 --> 01:03:23,160
like get the fuck out when you,
when you're ready for apartments and they,

1022
01:03:23,161 --> 01:03:25,920
you still get evicted. Like that's
when you know you fucked up. Well,

1023
01:03:25,921 --> 01:03:28,970
it was supposed to when one of them was
a skate park. Right. I know, but it was,

1024
01:03:28,971 --> 01:03:31,400
it was like,
it was like neck.

1025
01:03:31,401 --> 01:03:36,401
Then the next to it on one side was a
fucking like Russian hooker operation.

1026
01:03:38,540 --> 01:03:40,460
So they weren't complaining,
you know,

1027
01:03:40,490 --> 01:03:44,180
that dude's coming into fuck these
hookers all day long. Where did you live?

1028
01:03:44,280 --> 01:03:45,860
I have specific right across the street.

1029
01:03:46,470 --> 01:03:50,730
[inaudible]

1030
01:03:50,820 --> 01:03:54,140
a long time ago, but it was right across
the street from rock and roll. Ralph's.

1031
01:03:54,260 --> 01:03:58,490
Oh, right in the midst. Yeah. I mean,
right on the part of Sunset Boulevard.

1032
01:04:00,340 --> 01:04:04,110
The lawyers live in there.
Yeah. Shady, I guess.

1033
01:04:05,210 --> 01:04:08,300
I don't know that I ever
actually met him and I prompt me,

1034
01:04:08,310 --> 01:04:11,240
I mean yelling like through the door and
I go, whatever, maybe like a sunburn.

1035
01:04:11,270 --> 01:04:14,180
I wouldn't have recognized if you feel
like you want to go back and apologize to

1036
01:04:14,181 --> 01:04:18,890
him. I tried, I tried. I actually
had his email and um, you know,

1037
01:04:18,891 --> 01:04:21,640
I, I reached out to him and
I said, hey, like, you know,

1038
01:04:21,650 --> 01:04:24,590
it would mean a lot to me if like
we could meet up and you know,

1039
01:04:25,100 --> 01:04:28,430
and he just declined. So I had to respect
that, you know? But yeah, that was,

1040
01:04:28,431 --> 01:04:31,630
you had climbed in an email, he
declined. He declined to, to meet me.

1041
01:04:31,770 --> 01:04:34,490
And so I just sort of like,
when you're in that situation,

1042
01:04:34,520 --> 01:04:37,960
you want to go through and make things
right. You had to respect that, you know,

1043
01:04:37,961 --> 01:04:42,740
you can't like be persistent. So that,
so to make it right to that guy, like,

1044
01:04:43,100 --> 01:04:45,560
you know, it's called a living
amends where it sort of,

1045
01:04:45,561 --> 01:04:47,780
I'm not going to do that to anybody else.

1046
01:04:47,840 --> 01:04:52,040
And this is a part of thing about rehab.
It's like they ain't give me yeah,

1047
01:04:52,041 --> 01:04:54,980
of course. You know, like, I mean it's
basically a thing about life, you know.

1048
01:04:55,370 --> 01:04:59,010
But um, but something that they asked
you to do, like when you're, you,

1049
01:04:59,080 --> 01:05:00,860
you're going to rehab,
what rides?

1050
01:05:00,861 --> 01:05:04,480
It would be considered step nine
of the 12 steps, you know, we,

1051
01:05:04,481 --> 01:05:08,930
we made direct amends wherever possible
except when to do so would injure them

1052
01:05:08,931 --> 01:05:11,630
or others. So yeah. So
that's part of the deal.

1053
01:05:11,900 --> 01:05:15,290
And now I get finally get out of jail
and I come back and there's a fucking

1054
01:05:15,291 --> 01:05:18,250
eviction notice on my,
on my door, you know,

1055
01:05:18,251 --> 01:05:23,170
like get the fuck out within three days.
Oh actually that there was that.

1056
01:05:23,171 --> 01:05:26,920
Yeah, I got an end. Like I
had all drugs in my apartment,

1057
01:05:27,130 --> 01:05:29,650
so like I get back and like
there's the eviction notice,

1058
01:05:29,651 --> 01:05:32,620
but like I just go straight
for like the vials of ketamine.

1059
01:05:32,621 --> 01:05:36,070
I had like two or three more vials academy
and I cooked them up in the microwave.

1060
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:39,780
You know, I've, I went digging through,
Cook them up in the morning. How do you,

1061
01:05:39,850 --> 01:05:42,080
how do you handle ketamine? Well, you,

1062
01:05:42,110 --> 01:05:46,300
I mean it's best and I never disliked
injected shit. I just never got that far.

1063
01:05:46,301 --> 01:05:51,070
But, um, you just cook it in the microwave
and it evaporates like the maybe water,

1064
01:05:51,071 --> 01:05:54,550
I dunno. And then you're left
with like the, uh, the plate.

1065
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:59,410
It's like crusted to the plate and then
he scraped it up with like a card and

1066
01:05:59,560 --> 01:06:03,550
then snorted. Snorting. No. How'd you,

1067
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:06,850
how'd you get started on ketamine?
Because ketamine is like a cat.

1068
01:06:07,480 --> 01:06:12,200
I love that Shit, dude.
I love dude. Like, uh,

1069
01:06:12,610 --> 01:06:17,530
that was my favorite man.
First Time I tried it. I don't
think so. Neil Brennan a,

1070
01:06:17,531 --> 01:06:19,940
he's a cocreator of the Chappelle show.
Standup comic.

1071
01:06:20,890 --> 01:06:25,070
He's been taking ketamine treatments
for depression. Oh my God.

1072
01:06:28,970 --> 01:06:32,530
Yeah. It's one of the more
recent treatments for depression.

1073
01:06:32,560 --> 01:06:35,340
Why that they've been, well,
because it resets the way you,

1074
01:06:35,620 --> 01:06:39,930
any intense psychedelic experience and
ketamine, even though it's a tranquilizer,

1075
01:06:39,940 --> 01:06:42,080
is thought of as a pretty
insane associative,

1076
01:06:42,100 --> 01:06:46,480
it's basically a pharmacy to go PCP.
Really? That's how you look at it.

1077
01:06:46,900 --> 01:06:49,090
Yeah. It's a is what it is, man. Really.

1078
01:06:49,210 --> 01:06:52,900
But did you have like out
of body experiences or any
experiences where you felt

1079
01:06:52,901 --> 01:06:55,130
like you went it to another
dimension and trip but you know,

1080
01:06:55,150 --> 01:06:59,470
the k whole experience? Um, some of
the experiences I had with ketamine,

1081
01:06:59,471 --> 01:07:03,280
like a purse,
I got uh,

1082
01:07:03,670 --> 01:07:06,360
we depth reception like
way fucking just chill.

1083
01:07:06,370 --> 01:07:08,980
I was like some fear and loathing
shit, you know, like you're not like,

1084
01:07:08,981 --> 01:07:10,000
you know about it.
Like I've been,

1085
01:07:10,001 --> 01:07:14,350
I remember live like my fucking
feet are like 30 feet away.

1086
01:07:15,350 --> 01:07:19,660
That's fucked up. I remember one time I
was in a, in a, in a hotel room in London.

1087
01:07:20,020 --> 01:07:20,711
There's what like with,

1088
01:07:20,711 --> 01:07:25,000
with just way too much of the shit and
like at one point the whole hotel room

1089
01:07:25,001 --> 01:07:29,400
just started free falling. And I'm,
even when I'm in the sky, well nothing,

1090
01:07:29,410 --> 01:07:31,690
it was like, like looking
up. Like rather than like,

1091
01:07:31,990 --> 01:07:34,240
like I could actually see like,
uh,

1092
01:07:34,270 --> 01:07:38,680
like kind of an elevator shaft type deal
that it was falling through, you know,

1093
01:07:38,681 --> 01:07:42,340
like it was just the, the hotel room
started free falling. And I'm like,

1094
01:07:42,700 --> 01:07:45,700
just thinking, whoa. And I remember
being so stoked. I was thinking,

1095
01:07:45,701 --> 01:07:48,460
I remember thinking Jim Morrison
doesn't have shit on me.

1096
01:07:49,990 --> 01:07:54,760
Like I'm so good at being a drug
addict, you know, like a or whatever,

1097
01:07:54,761 --> 01:07:56,590
you know. But um, so yeah,

1098
01:07:56,591 --> 01:07:59,790
I've been cooking up the ketamine
and whatever and I pack is it come,

1099
01:07:59,800 --> 01:08:04,800
but it's in a liquid form because we
file file where you would stick a needle.

1100
01:08:05,061 --> 01:08:07,860
Let me shoot at a cat usually.
Sure.

1101
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:12,760
Category for I think horse as much.
I mean,

1102
01:08:12,761 --> 01:08:16,510
PCP started out as an anesthetic,
that was the,

1103
01:08:16,910 --> 01:08:20,730
the idea for it. But yeah, within
like two hours of being, of,

1104
01:08:20,731 --> 01:08:25,610
of walking out of jail,
I have my buddy videotaping me,

1105
01:08:25,611 --> 01:08:29,000
I'm jumping up and down on
the roof of a parked car,

1106
01:08:29,180 --> 01:08:33,630
screaming God is the son,
whatever that means.

1107
01:08:34,020 --> 01:08:37,050
Like and like,
and like this.

1108
01:08:39,720 --> 01:08:43,040
And I got it figured out.

1109
01:08:43,060 --> 01:08:46,850
[inaudible] need the sun for and,

1110
01:08:47,730 --> 01:08:52,370
and, and like, this squad of like,
security guards like comes over and like,

1111
01:08:52,371 --> 01:08:54,710
you know, what's going on.
You know, like, I mean,

1112
01:08:54,711 --> 01:08:59,711
it's amazing that I didn't go right
back into jail for another pockets for

1113
01:09:00,051 --> 01:09:04,780
drugs, you know, and so then, but I'm to,
and I did that bender lasted for, I dunno,

1114
01:09:04,820 --> 01:09:07,370
like maybe 24 hours and now I'm,

1115
01:09:07,380 --> 01:09:12,020
I've got my three days is, is
like, I've got one more day,

1116
01:09:12,021 --> 01:09:16,610
I gotta be out of the apartment. So
I send the mass email list. I say,

1117
01:09:16,790 --> 01:09:19,400
hey, you know, like with
all the jackass guys on it,

1118
01:09:19,401 --> 01:09:24,080
but of course 200 high power people
in Hollywood need to know this,

1119
01:09:24,380 --> 01:09:27,490
that like, Hey Knoxville
and guys, you know, I've, I,

1120
01:09:27,680 --> 01:09:31,610
I gotta be out of my apartment tomorrow
and I'm not fucking leaving my apartment.

1121
01:09:32,010 --> 01:09:36,050
Um, I don't want to fucking leave here
until I jumped out of my bedroom window.

1122
01:09:36,530 --> 01:09:36,991
You know,
it,

1123
01:09:36,991 --> 01:09:41,991
she'll be like a 25 foot drop onto the
sidewalk and I need you guys to bring

1124
01:09:43,790 --> 01:09:45,200
something for me to land on.

1125
01:09:45,201 --> 01:09:50,201
Preferably a hot tub or like put a hot
tub and cannon ball into it out of my

1126
01:09:51,351 --> 01:09:55,700
bedroom window. And, and uh, in my
sliding glass door in the living room,

1127
01:09:56,390 --> 01:10:00,620
I could pull it open and I wanted to put
like a ramp in the living room and ride

1128
01:10:00,621 --> 01:10:01,610
a motorcycle,

1129
01:10:01,910 --> 01:10:05,120
like often ramp through the sliding
glass door and jump onto the roof of

1130
01:10:05,150 --> 01:10:08,910
[inaudible] if you own an
apartment in this motherfucker.

1131
01:10:09,970 --> 01:10:12,540
Makes fun of me about them.
What the sliding glass door.

1132
01:10:12,541 --> 01:10:13,251
And then because he's like,

1133
01:10:13,251 --> 01:10:15,230
this is like a three foot gap
to the building next door.

1134
01:10:15,231 --> 01:10:19,080
I like that part was a gimme,
you know, but uh, so I said like,

1135
01:10:19,210 --> 01:10:20,510
because I see you guys come over,

1136
01:10:20,511 --> 01:10:23,300
bring the fucking camera and this is
what we're going to fucking start filming

1137
01:10:23,540 --> 01:10:27,830
jackass three and like a, you know,
get over your comment before I leave,

1138
01:10:27,831 --> 01:10:30,920
we're going to do my eviction
party stunts. And uh,

1139
01:10:31,580 --> 01:10:34,220
and so basically I scheduled
my own intervention.

1140
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:38,890
Knoxville reached out to doctor drew
who was on the list, the email lands.

1141
01:10:38,891 --> 01:10:43,130
He's like, Casey and Steve was like
about to die. And doctor drew said, yeah,

1142
01:10:43,430 --> 01:10:45,920
you're right. You know, he said
get over there and fucking,

1143
01:10:45,921 --> 01:10:48,020
if you got to tie him up,
put him in the trunk.

1144
01:10:48,410 --> 01:10:52,550
Like a take him to the hospital.
Oh and that the other part I've said,

1145
01:10:52,551 --> 01:10:55,910
if you don't bring anything for me to
land on, I'm fucking jumping anyway.

1146
01:10:55,911 --> 01:10:59,180
I promise I'm ready to die.
So they printed that up.

1147
01:10:59,181 --> 01:11:01,490
It was like immediate
threatening my own life,

1148
01:11:01,670 --> 01:11:05,270
which qualified me for the 51 50 law
where you can lock someone into a

1149
01:11:05,271 --> 01:11:07,670
psychiatric ward.
Wow.

1150
01:11:07,940 --> 01:11:12,200
They came over to to for my
intervention and and like,

1151
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:13,290
they're like,

1152
01:11:13,290 --> 01:11:16,620
it wasn't like the kind of intervention
where like where they ask if you're

1153
01:11:16,621 --> 01:11:19,290
willing to accept help,
you know, it's like,

1154
01:11:19,540 --> 01:11:21,030
like we're taking you to the psych ward.

1155
01:11:21,030 --> 01:11:22,440
This is what's going to
happen if you don't like it,

1156
01:11:22,441 --> 01:11:24,210
we're going to kick your
ass and take you anyway.

1157
01:11:24,690 --> 01:11:28,940
So they'd take me to the psych ward for
the 72 hour hold, which is like, you know,

1158
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:33,450
everybody's been on that. Yeah, I
Britney Spears or like, you know,

1159
01:11:33,451 --> 01:11:35,850
the whole deal.
But the thing was when we got there,

1160
01:11:35,851 --> 01:11:37,980
I was like spitting on people.
I was just like,

1161
01:11:37,981 --> 01:11:42,660
not fucking cool and like I was trying
to like throw shit around and you know,

1162
01:11:42,661 --> 01:11:43,770
like I'm like when I remember,

1163
01:11:43,771 --> 01:11:46,370
cause I thought it was kind of
like calmly explained that it was a

1164
01:11:46,371 --> 01:11:50,700
misunderstanding and be out of there.
But like what happened was I,

1165
01:11:50,920 --> 01:11:54,840
they had the emails printed out where
I'm like saying I'm ready to die and you

1166
01:11:54,841 --> 01:11:57,450
know, and so like they had me, I
wasn't talking my way out of it.

1167
01:11:57,750 --> 01:12:02,580
Once I realized I wasn't getting
out of it then a, I'm like fuck,

1168
01:12:02,610 --> 01:12:06,300
you know like grab and go to take a
chair and throw it and like I get fucking

1169
01:12:06,301 --> 01:12:08,910
tackled by like these orderly dudes,
you know?

1170
01:12:09,180 --> 01:12:13,590
And they slammed me onto this fucking
a leg stretch her like bed thing with

1171
01:12:13,591 --> 01:12:18,000
straps on it and like someone jabs and
needle and my budget sheet and then I

1172
01:12:18,001 --> 01:12:22,530
just straight
like that thorazine shit man.

1173
01:12:22,531 --> 01:12:26,430
Like is gnarly man held you
down and whack to with us? Yeah.

1174
01:12:26,460 --> 01:12:30,000
They just held me down and fucking
jammed my butt cheek and I was out, dude.

1175
01:12:30,001 --> 01:12:34,810
And then I woke up from my
nap and, and uh, I'm in, it
was so funny talking to him.

1176
01:12:35,130 --> 01:12:38,520
It was at Cedar Sinai, the
thallium, you know, like, uh,

1177
01:12:38,570 --> 01:12:43,570
I mean the Allianz was just the
mental health division or whatever.

1178
01:12:44,550 --> 01:12:48,990
So like they have, um, they've
got, they had two wings of the,

1179
01:12:48,991 --> 01:12:50,700
of the psych ward there.
Like one,

1180
01:12:50,730 --> 01:12:55,110
like they've got the standard issue
harmful to yourself or others, you know,

1181
01:12:55,620 --> 01:13:00,450
like committed for the involuntary
psychiatric hold. Then they've got the,

1182
01:13:00,780 --> 01:13:05,700
the something else. They the
extraordinarily, you know, like, uh,

1183
01:13:05,701 --> 01:13:10,560
the extraordinarily qualifying
individuals, you know, and
the something else wing.

1184
01:13:11,570 --> 01:13:15,210
So instead they had me on the
sub the downswing and like, yeah.

1185
01:13:15,211 --> 01:13:17,410
And like my roommate
was like fucking like,

1186
01:13:17,790 --> 01:13:22,080
like hiding in the closet from like
fucking demons. Oh Dude. It was,

1187
01:13:22,220 --> 01:13:25,060
I had been hearing voices
for like a couple of years,

1188
01:13:30,570 --> 01:13:34,640
but nothing like this guy
voices say, Oh, do you, oh,

1189
01:13:34,720 --> 01:13:37,530
you're the best dog. Like
your cell phone, your back.

1190
01:13:39,980 --> 01:13:41,700
I hadn't angels and demons,
you know,

1191
01:13:41,701 --> 01:13:45,420
like some of them would tell me like
your woodland's he needed to die and I

1192
01:13:45,421 --> 01:13:49,380
would be like trying to suffocate myself
to death, you know, really well. Yeah.

1193
01:13:49,381 --> 01:13:53,640
I mean, not like with anything. I'm
just holding my breath. There was a game

1194
01:13:55,800 --> 01:13:58,490
that was like, well, you're right.

1195
01:13:59,890 --> 01:14:03,690
But that was the whole thing was I was
hearing voices because I was huffing so

1196
01:14:03,691 --> 01:14:08,190
much nitris oxide and like while,
while, um, while you're doing ketamine,

1197
01:14:08,191 --> 01:14:10,620
while I was doing cocaine,
I never smoked this joint.

1198
01:14:10,621 --> 01:14:14,010
Just fucking relax with you in the room.
Right.

1199
01:14:15,310 --> 01:14:18,670
I know. You make me feel so
much better about myself.

1200
01:14:21,800 --> 01:14:25,480
I used to watch izer watch intervention
so that I could feel better at night.

1201
01:14:26,440 --> 01:14:30,370
I'm worried about your health more than
I'm worried about like you overdosing,

1202
01:14:30,780 --> 01:14:31,900
you're over. Um, it's,

1203
01:14:32,020 --> 01:14:36,280
it's a slow deterioration of your fiber.
Yeah.

1204
01:14:36,420 --> 01:14:40,480
Like the stuff that keeps you
together talking. Man, I'm fine now.

1205
01:14:40,540 --> 01:14:45,420
I bet right now I feel like I just worked
out and after talking to Steve last

1206
01:14:45,430 --> 01:14:46,660
juice in a yoga class,

1207
01:14:50,480 --> 01:14:51,240
yeah,
I may.

1208
01:14:51,240 --> 01:14:54,140
But whenever like they sent us and I'm
in and something else word like people

1209
01:14:54,141 --> 01:14:55,820
are like not people.
One Guy,

1210
01:14:55,850 --> 01:14:59,710
I remember one guy like the shit on
the fucking ground and was like break

1211
01:14:59,711 --> 01:15:00,950
dancing in it. Right. Try to run.

1212
01:15:04,580 --> 01:15:07,640
I mean it sounds like I'm making it
up. I swear I'm not dude. He was,

1213
01:15:07,641 --> 01:15:11,810
his goal was to like smear it around
as much as he could.

1214
01:15:11,811 --> 01:15:16,700
And this is in the room with you? No, no
that was in the hallway. In the hallway.

1215
01:15:16,701 --> 01:15:19,360
It was another dude. It's
breakdancing. Got his own shit.

1216
01:15:19,361 --> 01:15:21,080
I mean it looked like it was
break dancing but he was like,

1217
01:15:21,081 --> 01:15:23,950
you took a shit and he's trying to smear
it around as much as he could and said,

1218
01:15:23,970 --> 01:15:26,600
oh it just looked like
it was break dancing.

1219
01:15:28,670 --> 01:15:32,870
Oh my God.
Had me in there because how is,

1220
01:15:35,540 --> 01:15:40,400
because I was so belligerent,
I was so belligerent.

1221
01:15:40,520 --> 01:15:45,520
They changed my status from (515)
025-0250 which meant they had like,

1222
01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:49,340
like 51 50 is three days,
50 to 50 it's two weeks.

1223
01:15:49,670 --> 01:15:53,480
So they had me for two weeks and like,
after like four days,

1224
01:15:53,530 --> 01:15:56,180
then they moved me over to the,
to the regular psych ward.

1225
01:15:56,570 --> 01:15:58,670
And like I was in there and,
um,

1226
01:15:59,720 --> 01:16:01,970
this guy who is like a fucking,

1227
01:16:01,971 --> 01:16:06,140
he says is a heroin addict and
he's a patient and like he's,

1228
01:16:06,141 --> 01:16:10,520
he's got this book about
alcoholism and it's like, dude,
you have, you really like,

1229
01:16:10,580 --> 01:16:14,390
this book can really help you. Like
you need this book. And I'm like,

1230
01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:19,600
why is it fucking heroin addict given me
a book about alcoholism when we're both

1231
01:16:20,090 --> 01:16:24,390
like on suicide watch in a psych ward,
you know, like what's the deal? And,

1232
01:16:24,391 --> 01:16:28,670
and I was like, at the point
I was like, I'm like, dude,
I can't, I can't get sober.

1233
01:16:28,671 --> 01:16:33,410
I couldn't, you know, I was, I honestly
felt like, like nine and felt like,

1234
01:16:33,411 --> 01:16:35,540
I mean like just core belief,
you know,

1235
01:16:35,541 --> 01:16:39,950
that like if I could have ever gotten
sober, like I was past that point,

1236
01:16:40,010 --> 01:16:44,270
I was too far down the line.
I was a write off a loss cause and like,

1237
01:16:44,590 --> 01:16:47,600
so I just, you know, like from when
the fucking first time I was in rehab,

1238
01:16:47,601 --> 01:16:50,030
you know,
like there's no chance.

1239
01:16:50,390 --> 01:16:53,990
And so like one night I couldn't sleep
and I like some just open this fucking

1240
01:16:53,991 --> 01:16:58,160
stupid book, like not to find a solution
but in straight up to kill time,

1241
01:16:58,220 --> 01:17:01,700
you know, that's all I'm trying to do and
I'm reading it. It's talking about like,

1242
01:17:02,330 --> 01:17:06,500
you know, like hopeless alcoholics
determined to die and this and that.

1243
01:17:06,501 --> 01:17:10,270
And then like they, they become like,
you know, they get better or whatever,

1244
01:17:10,280 --> 01:17:13,460
you know, they become like the finest men
who could meet and that. And I'm like,

1245
01:17:13,970 --> 01:17:15,770
just remember reading
it, thinking like, dude,

1246
01:17:15,771 --> 01:17:19,880
what it's saying is like the more
hopeless, the more fucked up you are,

1247
01:17:19,881 --> 01:17:21,920
the better the chances for recovery,

1248
01:17:21,921 --> 01:17:26,921
which is actually really fully because
if you had like any inkling and I did

1249
01:17:27,381 --> 01:17:29,390
like you can manage it,
that you could get better,

1250
01:17:29,391 --> 01:17:32,150
that you could stop on your own and
you're just straight up not a candidate.

1251
01:17:33,390 --> 01:17:37,430
The Rock bottom theory pretty much.
And it's, it's, it's true, like if, if,

1252
01:17:37,431 --> 01:17:41,570
if you feel like you got it are there,
it's not that big of a deal because

1253
01:17:44,280 --> 01:17:45,950
he likes for me,
like step one,

1254
01:17:45,951 --> 01:17:50,450
we admitted we were powerless over alcohol
or drugs or whatever the case may be.

1255
01:17:50,470 --> 01:17:54,740
Like, like, like, and, and that like
that I've successfully did you? No,

1256
01:17:54,741 --> 01:17:58,760
like I can't do it. I'm fucking powerless.
And so that's like the first step.

1257
01:17:58,761 --> 01:18:01,570
That's like the prerequisite.
And so it's like, I dunno.

1258
01:18:01,580 --> 01:18:05,060
And then these guys come in and talk about
alcoholism and I wouldn't have fucked,

1259
01:18:05,061 --> 01:18:08,360
never listen to a word they
said, but they like, you know,

1260
01:18:08,361 --> 01:18:11,960
but I was locked up in a psych ward
and so I did and I'm like, you know,

1261
01:18:11,961 --> 01:18:13,490
thinking there's nothing
I could do about it.

1262
01:18:13,491 --> 01:18:16,010
But they told their stories and
how they lived and I'm like, oh,

1263
01:18:16,011 --> 01:18:20,990
these guys can do it, you know? And so I
was just like, my life is a fucking mess.

1264
01:18:21,050 --> 01:18:24,920
I was in the psych ward long enough to
be like, okay, my life's a fucking mass.

1265
01:18:25,340 --> 01:18:27,740
It's time. And I went to
rehab and you know, like,

1266
01:18:27,950 --> 01:18:31,850
and so you've been clean for seven and
a half years, just from that moment on,

1267
01:18:31,851 --> 01:18:34,760
from the, from that moment on. Yup. Wow.

1268
01:18:34,761 --> 01:18:37,910
And there's been any moments where
you're attempted to go off the wagon?

1269
01:18:38,960 --> 01:18:43,040
I mean sure, but like, not
like I went from there,

1270
01:18:43,170 --> 01:18:47,210
like door to door into like a rehab,
you know? And I remember like,

1271
01:18:47,211 --> 01:18:49,760
because I knew from the
fucking back in the day,

1272
01:18:49,761 --> 01:18:54,440
like the whole 95 out and percent of
alcoholics don't get sober, like the,

1273
01:18:54,441 --> 01:18:58,820
the guy who was in charge of the Rehab and
back then it was Dr drew, like, he was,

1274
01:18:58,821 --> 01:19:02,960
he was the, the chemical dependency
director of this hospital in Pasadena.

1275
01:19:03,430 --> 01:19:08,210
And, uh, and I was like,
yeah. And I, I told drew,

1276
01:19:08,211 --> 01:19:09,770
I said, hey, I said, hey man, you know,

1277
01:19:09,771 --> 01:19:12,200
I'm like right on fresh out of
the psych ward. Like, you know,

1278
01:19:12,201 --> 01:19:16,790
and I was such a fucking character.
I was like an ad. I'm like, dude,

1279
01:19:16,791 --> 01:19:21,680
I know that. Like, I know that, you know,
the odds are not in my fucking favor.

1280
01:19:21,681 --> 01:19:24,110
I know, like, I mean I don't want to
waste my time. If I'm going to do this,

1281
01:19:24,111 --> 01:19:24,944
I want to get it right.

1282
01:19:25,010 --> 01:19:29,980
So I told drew however long you'd
recommend that I didn't mean that I stayed

1283
01:19:29,981 --> 01:19:34,190
here. I want to stay significantly
longer cause I want to give myself like,

1284
01:19:34,220 --> 01:19:37,220
you know, I want to give myself an
advantage. He said that's great, you know,

1285
01:19:37,221 --> 01:19:40,190
but like don't stay here more than
30 days if you're really serious,

1286
01:19:40,191 --> 01:19:44,030
go into like a sober living, you know,
like a halfway house kind of a deal. And,

1287
01:19:44,031 --> 01:19:48,320
and so I did man. I did everything that
was fucking people do me. I did like, uh,

1288
01:19:49,220 --> 01:19:51,980
all the fucking recovery
shit that they talk about.

1289
01:19:51,981 --> 01:19:56,810
I did it all and I went to the fucking
sober living and I stayed there until I

1290
01:19:56,811 --> 01:19:58,700
had to two full years of sobriety.

1291
01:19:58,940 --> 01:20:01,700
I was filming where you stayed
in sober living for 30 years.

1292
01:20:02,130 --> 01:20:06,800
I was bouncing around treatment,
um, like uh, for six months,

1293
01:20:07,170 --> 01:20:09,240
you know, cause I, cause I was
having a tough time with it.

1294
01:20:09,241 --> 01:20:11,030
I just stayed in fucking treatment.
You know.

1295
01:20:11,190 --> 01:20:14,730
When you say bouncing around
treatment? Well, I did 30 days there.

1296
01:20:14,731 --> 01:20:18,180
Then I went into like a sober
living that doubled. It was like,

1297
01:20:18,210 --> 01:20:19,800
it was like sort of mid level care.

1298
01:20:19,801 --> 01:20:24,801
So like I was free to go at night as long
as I was home by curfew button all day

1299
01:20:25,140 --> 01:20:27,690
long. Right. We had all of our little
groups and like, like you know,

1300
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:31,230
structured rehab activities,
how much is all the should cost.

1301
01:20:31,380 --> 01:20:35,430
It's expensive because it was stupid.
Like the 30 days is like a hundred grand.

1302
01:20:35,700 --> 01:20:39,210
I'm like, what the fuck? And they
didn't even necessarily know that.

1303
01:20:40,220 --> 01:20:44,250
So pay for all this I paid for
with my own money. Oh my God.

1304
01:20:44,310 --> 01:20:46,740
So you're just burning through your
savings while you're in there burning

1305
01:20:46,741 --> 01:20:49,000
through savings. Yeah. God.

1306
01:20:49,040 --> 01:20:54,000
So six months is better than the fucking
seen to $300,000 I spent on fucking

1307
01:20:54,001 --> 01:20:58,080
suing like my, these fucking people. I
knew I was going to get nothing out of.

1308
01:20:58,600 --> 01:21:01,960
He spent 300 grand suing people that you
knew you were going to get nothing out

1309
01:21:01,961 --> 01:21:04,240
of them. I got like my back
catalog. These guys that are,

1310
01:21:04,250 --> 01:21:08,760
that I had a distribution deal with.
I got my back catalog of DVDs,

1311
01:21:08,790 --> 01:21:12,240
but whatever, that's not worth anything.
It was just a straight resentment.

1312
01:21:13,410 --> 01:21:17,760
I just spent three, I just wanted
to fuck their lives up and I did it,

1313
01:21:17,930 --> 01:21:21,330
but it cost me 300 grand.
Rehab is a better investment.

1314
01:21:22,830 --> 01:21:26,940
So, so while you're in there,
are you working? Hell No.

1315
01:21:26,970 --> 01:21:29,680
I ain't no fucking burned all my
bridges, man. You know what I mean?

1316
01:21:29,710 --> 01:21:33,090
But we weren't doing anything with Jack
Ass and like anything else I had going

1317
01:21:33,091 --> 01:21:36,630
on. Like I had a TV show that, which was
really like, did well in the ratings,

1318
01:21:36,631 --> 01:21:40,530
but I was such a fucking nightmare that
they canceled it just on the grounds

1319
01:21:40,531 --> 01:21:45,320
that I, they did not want to fuck with
me. I had this spot right after, um,

1320
01:21:45,780 --> 01:21:49,230
Monday night raw, the wrestling
on the USA network. Wow.

1321
01:21:49,260 --> 01:21:52,530
I came on immediately after
and I kept like a fucking,

1322
01:21:52,531 --> 01:21:56,520
a whopping percentage of their viewership.
Dr Steva.

1323
01:21:58,080 --> 01:21:59,940
I went around in a fucking,
uh,

1324
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:05,000
modified ambulance with a hot chick
and a fucking 365 pound black football

1325
01:22:07,141 --> 01:22:08,190
player,
driver dude,

1326
01:22:08,610 --> 01:22:13,040
just trying to deal with sify America
one was he at a time it and I would be

1327
01:22:13,080 --> 01:22:13,913
trying to get them to do,

1328
01:22:13,940 --> 01:22:16,890
I would except like it submissions where
people would be like, Doctor Steve,

1329
01:22:16,891 --> 01:22:19,860
I need your help. Like I, you know,
I'm a whiskey. Like this is my,

1330
01:22:19,890 --> 01:22:24,210
my unique and case and I would prescribe
for them some kind of like outrageous,

1331
01:22:24,211 --> 01:22:27,720
like jack ass bullshit to make them
come out of their shell or like,

1332
01:22:27,930 --> 01:22:31,210
it was good man. Like, uh, I
did a great job problem. Was it,

1333
01:22:31,211 --> 01:22:35,070
as soon as the cameras stopped rolling,
I fell off of the radar except for my,

1334
01:22:35,100 --> 01:22:39,060
my like uh,
the,

1335
01:22:39,240 --> 01:22:43,230
it was a visit with a bunion memory.
The production company, like I did my,

1336
01:22:43,231 --> 01:22:48,231
I would be in started like openly
attacking like a John Murray Watt on my,

1337
01:22:49,321 --> 01:22:53,050
uh, for 200 people off
on, cause he wasn't,

1338
01:22:53,090 --> 01:22:55,440
he wouldn't like pay somebody,
one of my buddies,

1339
01:22:55,441 --> 01:22:57,510
something I wanted them to get paid for,

1340
01:22:57,780 --> 01:23:00,630
which they did weren't obligated
to fucking pain in the first place.

1341
01:23:00,630 --> 01:23:05,320
But I'm trying to ruin his reputation
with like all these, you know,

1342
01:23:05,321 --> 01:23:07,330
on my fucking crazy email list.

1343
01:23:07,680 --> 01:23:11,110
And that was what that was what killed
the show despite the fact that it was

1344
01:23:11,111 --> 01:23:13,660
like number one and
it's fucking time slot.

1345
01:23:15,360 --> 01:23:19,720
So I didn't have that fucking to
get to distract me from my recovery

1346
01:23:22,150 --> 01:23:26,050
would not cover as you're nothing but
how do you spend your days like when

1347
01:23:26,051 --> 01:23:30,230
you're doing that? Well, I mean when
you're in Rehab, Rehab like you,

1348
01:23:30,231 --> 01:23:34,900
you got like fucking structured
shit all day long. What do you do?

1349
01:23:35,740 --> 01:23:37,840
I mean like different
kinds of groups like a,

1350
01:23:37,841 --> 01:23:41,530
they take you out to various kinds
of meetings, you know, like, um,

1351
01:23:41,770 --> 01:23:46,320
you got like fucking like a little
therapy bits like uh, you know,

1352
01:23:46,570 --> 01:23:47,160
whatever.

1353
01:23:47,160 --> 01:23:51,010
It's basically like summer camp and just
everything is geared towards teaching

1354
01:23:51,040 --> 01:23:54,400
how to stay sober all day long.
Yeah.

1355
01:23:54,990 --> 01:23:59,560
How much can they teach you about
staying? So I'm confused. There's like a,

1356
01:23:59,561 --> 01:24:00,050
there's,

1357
01:24:00,050 --> 01:24:03,250
there's a lot and I didn't mean a lot
of it's redundant but it's going on for

1358
01:24:03,251 --> 01:24:06,620
two years. Oh No, not that
I, this is, I'm talking to,

1359
01:24:07,960 --> 01:24:08,930
I'm talking about the first 30.

1360
01:24:08,940 --> 01:24:13,660
So the first 30 days it's like teaching
you like coping mechanisms and mostly

1361
01:24:13,661 --> 01:24:15,070
just sort of keeping you like,

1362
01:24:15,100 --> 01:24:19,900
and it's safe environments were occupied
and drilling into your head that you

1363
01:24:19,901 --> 01:24:24,901
can do this and he's like 38 this isn't
going to do shit for anybody because

1364
01:24:25,541 --> 01:24:27,670
it's such a slow process,
you know? But, uh,

1365
01:24:28,660 --> 01:24:33,400
like it was great for me to stay and
sort of in that environment for two years

1366
01:24:33,760 --> 01:24:38,050
because, uh, because you know, then like,
I'm like undisciplined motherfucker,

1367
01:24:38,051 --> 01:24:39,820
you know,
by the end of it I was so like,

1368
01:24:39,850 --> 01:24:44,850
used to like being up by 9:00 AM with
my bed made like pissing into fucking

1369
01:24:45,011 --> 01:24:47,200
plastic cups, like at random, you know,

1370
01:24:47,201 --> 01:24:50,980
twice a week like scrubbing the toilet
when it's my turn to scrub the toilet,

1371
01:24:50,981 --> 01:24:53,660
you know, like keeping
everything, you know, and, and,

1372
01:24:53,661 --> 01:24:57,010
and I did that and when I'm filming
Jackass Three d, I'm like, oh yeah,

1373
01:24:57,011 --> 01:25:01,360
like I got to go fucking get washed into
the fucking sky in a Porta potty for a

1374
01:25:01,361 --> 01:25:06,070
dog. Shit, I might be a little bit late
for curfew tonight, you know, like,

1375
01:25:06,570 --> 01:25:07,650
or whatever, you know, like,

1376
01:25:07,910 --> 01:25:12,910
and it had this curfew on the weekdays,

1377
01:25:13,300 --> 01:25:18,300
it was 10 and then on the weekends
it was 11 or 12 what or maybe not,

1378
01:25:21,461 --> 01:25:24,100
I think it was 11 on the
weekdays and 12 on the weekend.

1379
01:25:24,130 --> 01:25:27,130
I think it's hilarious that
after a certain time of night,

1380
01:25:27,400 --> 01:25:30,670
like they think you're just going to
get wacky. Well, I mean, whatever,

1381
01:25:31,240 --> 01:25:34,480
you can't go to a diner, you know,
what do it saved my life man.

1382
01:25:34,540 --> 01:25:38,640
If I can say my life big time and I'm
sure fucking stoked about it. So just the,

1383
01:25:38,680 --> 01:25:42,810
the, the, the schedule, the
rigid schedule, the routine.

1384
01:25:43,260 --> 01:25:47,360
They had the structure man, the structure
and enjoy in there. Did you have fun?

1385
01:25:47,361 --> 01:25:52,330
Did you meet Nice people? I
mean, I remember it pretty well.

1386
01:25:52,331 --> 01:25:54,610
My roommate was cool and like he snored,

1387
01:25:54,611 --> 01:25:57,670
which was like the fucking greatest thing
ever because I knew when it was cool

1388
01:25:57,671 --> 01:26:02,450
to jack off, you know, you know,

1389
01:26:03,210 --> 01:26:07,400
it's like the sweet sounds of snoring
or jacking off with the guy in the room.

1390
01:26:07,730 --> 01:26:11,960
But if he's snoring it's totally
cool. Yeah. And so that helped

1391
01:26:17,850 --> 01:26:21,320
in
the middle of

1392
01:26:22,970 --> 01:26:27,170
man, like uh, the, I mean
that helps a lot. If he,

1393
01:26:27,171 --> 01:26:29,690
if he didn't snore I a had a tougher time.

1394
01:26:30,020 --> 01:26:32,660
Are you allowed to have relationships
where in there are you supposed to like

1395
01:26:32,661 --> 01:26:35,840
steer clear thing?
They can sort of any distract you?

1396
01:26:36,440 --> 01:26:39,260
I mean there's no like hard
and fast rule about that.

1397
01:26:39,261 --> 01:26:43,130
Like they say like avoid getting in a
relationship and your first year I got to

1398
01:26:43,131 --> 01:26:45,950
her first year. Yeah, I
got into a relationship.

1399
01:26:46,670 --> 01:26:51,060
I mean I like what have you found with
the perfect girl? Yeah. I mean it happens,

1400
01:26:53,720 --> 01:26:56,990
it happens, you know, but like
there's just not like, you know,

1401
01:26:56,991 --> 01:26:58,820
like relationships gone sideways.

1402
01:26:58,821 --> 01:27:02,960
He's like the number one fucking thing
that makes people get loaded. Oh right.

1403
01:27:02,990 --> 01:27:07,820
That makes sense. So it's good to like
kind of like, you know, just worry about

1404
01:27:09,560 --> 01:27:10,160
your sobriety.

1405
01:27:10,160 --> 01:27:15,020
But I had seven months and I got in a
relationship with a chick who had like one

1406
01:27:15,021 --> 01:27:19,340
year and it was cool, you know, like
we were last year, like 10 months.

1407
01:27:20,300 --> 01:27:23,390
So when you're in there,
you're in there for 30 days,

1408
01:27:23,391 --> 01:27:27,230
this is the hardcore version. And then
you go from the 30 days to like, uh,

1409
01:27:27,231 --> 01:27:31,610
living situation, a hot and now
how's that? Is that like a house?

1410
01:27:31,611 --> 01:27:35,060
Like how's it work? It was like
an apartment complex. That point.

1411
01:27:35,950 --> 01:27:40,560
You've got your own apartment then? Yeah,
but I had to park a skate park. Yeah.

1412
01:27:41,690 --> 01:27:42,830
That was my thing. I was like, man,

1413
01:27:42,831 --> 01:27:45,350
I used to have fucking four
apartments in one building.

1414
01:27:45,380 --> 01:27:49,310
Now I got four dudes and one apartment.
So you got to live with other people.

1415
01:27:49,790 --> 01:27:52,040
I had a roommate and you know,
there's two,

1416
01:27:52,041 --> 01:27:56,480
two bedroom apartment and two guys in the
trout. What? Yeah. And that was the deal.

1417
01:27:56,510 --> 01:27:59,600
Why is it the deal? Because they want to
make sure you're not alone by herself.

1418
01:28:00,500 --> 01:28:03,720
Do DV Shit. I'd like perhaps, you know,

1419
01:28:04,370 --> 01:28:07,880
I guess that's kind of the deal, but
like now what happened? They're like,

1420
01:28:07,990 --> 01:28:11,420
and we would have groups from like eight
or nine in the morning until two in the

1421
01:28:11,421 --> 01:28:13,040
afternoon and then you're free to go.

1422
01:28:13,041 --> 01:28:15,590
And I would be like
skateboarding or whatever,

1423
01:28:15,591 --> 01:28:19,100
like trying to film this wacky
shit or whatever, you know,

1424
01:28:19,101 --> 01:28:23,750
like I didn't do like much
like in a professional sense.

1425
01:28:24,130 --> 01:28:29,060
Um, and I was working with, I was working
on all this like 12 step shit, you know,

1426
01:28:29,270 --> 01:28:32,630
so like I get like, uh,
you know, we do like the,

1427
01:28:33,090 --> 01:28:36,470
the searching and fearless moral
inventory where like we go through like,

1428
01:28:36,820 --> 01:28:41,180
you know, basically like what have we done
that like that we feel are, they went,

1429
01:28:41,220 --> 01:28:43,130
like when we make a list of resentments,

1430
01:28:43,380 --> 01:28:47,150
make a list of fears and we make a
list of Shit we feel guilty about is

1431
01:28:47,151 --> 01:28:49,270
basically how it works.
And like, you know,

1432
01:28:49,280 --> 01:28:52,280
I started off with just the shit I
felt guilty about and I'm like, oh,

1433
01:28:52,281 --> 01:28:56,450
like I was fine. I just basically wrote
a list of like the shit that I felt like,

1434
01:28:56,480 --> 01:28:59,670
you know, the most terrible about it.
And when, when I went through it like,

1435
01:29:00,260 --> 01:29:03,990
and this is like tone, if anyone's in
recovery, like avoid like making the,

1436
01:29:03,991 --> 01:29:07,740
the system this mistake, I treated
it like I was just like, you know,

1437
01:29:07,741 --> 01:29:10,950
putting myself on trial for being
a bad person and like, you know,

1438
01:29:11,280 --> 01:29:14,340
the whole point is just to
figure out like what your MD,

1439
01:29:14,360 --> 01:29:18,770
take an inventory and like you discard
what's not helpful and you can keep what

1440
01:29:18,790 --> 01:29:23,790
is, you know, he's just discontinue shit
that doesn't serve you. But I'm like,

1441
01:29:23,791 --> 01:29:26,280
no, I'm a terrible person. I did
this and this and this and this.

1442
01:29:26,281 --> 01:29:28,050
And then I'm like, oh fuck. You know,

1443
01:29:28,580 --> 01:29:32,630
and like I was just God like winning like
a gnarly depression and felt like I'd

1444
01:29:32,670 --> 01:29:36,240
fucking, I don't deserve to
live, you know, like whatever.

1445
01:29:36,241 --> 01:29:39,910
And like I fucking checked myself into
a psych ward number two. You know,

1446
01:29:40,050 --> 01:29:43,380
while you were in recovery. Yeah,
I had, cause you were going over,

1447
01:29:43,440 --> 01:29:47,100
I had like three months of sobriety and
I went to one of my meetings and I was

1448
01:29:47,101 --> 01:29:48,150
like,
I was like,

1449
01:29:48,210 --> 01:29:52,560
I buy all the work I'm putting
into my fucking recovery on all.

1450
01:29:52,561 --> 01:29:54,510
I feel like I'm getting
out of it is self hatred.

1451
01:29:54,511 --> 01:29:57,030
I feel like I just can't forgive
myself for this shit. I'm done.

1452
01:29:57,390 --> 01:29:59,310
I'm fucking hate myself.
And you know,

1453
01:29:59,480 --> 01:30:02,690
and this all came about from just
doing an inventory on your past?

1454
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:05,790
Pretty much. Yeah. I just had
sad like, and it says, you know,

1455
01:30:05,810 --> 01:30:09,480
and some of the literature man,
it says it like, you know, uh,

1456
01:30:09,510 --> 01:30:12,030
the inventory process we'll like,
you know,

1457
01:30:12,031 --> 01:30:15,360
bring about like self loathing for a lot
of people when we take an honest look

1458
01:30:15,361 --> 01:30:18,740
at like the fucking pieces of shit
that we became like that's like a,

1459
01:30:18,741 --> 01:30:21,450
a not an uncommon side
effect, you know, like

1460
01:30:22,600 --> 01:30:27,040
what sort of tools they give you
to look at your past but not,

1461
01:30:27,190 --> 01:30:29,140
not be angry at yourself,
not judge yourself.

1462
01:30:29,600 --> 01:30:34,450
Well, I mean, I don't know. I like it.
Like when I'm helping guys get sober,

1463
01:30:34,480 --> 01:30:38,930
I try and tell him, look man, this isn't
a process of putting you on trial, man.

1464
01:30:38,931 --> 01:30:42,500
This is just if I can figuring
out what to stop doing now.

1465
01:30:42,501 --> 01:30:44,510
And that's the best
thing I can say about it.

1466
01:30:44,960 --> 01:30:49,100
But when I was in that second psych
ward, like, uh, you know, I was like,

1467
01:30:49,130 --> 01:30:49,701
like I wrote,

1468
01:30:49,701 --> 01:30:53,300
I wrote some letters to people who have
felt the most fucked up about what I'd

1469
01:30:53,301 --> 01:30:58,160
done, you know, and like, and it actually
kind of turned around where I was like,

1470
01:30:58,161 --> 01:30:58,790
you know,

1471
01:30:58,790 --> 01:31:03,650
I wasn't like today I'm
fucking so thankful for the
shit that I did that I felt

1472
01:31:03,651 --> 01:31:07,400
that bad about it because
like, no longer is it like, oh,

1473
01:31:07,460 --> 01:31:11,720
I don't deserve to live because
I did that for me today.

1474
01:31:11,720 --> 01:31:16,430
It's like I'm fucking desperate to not be
that fucking asshole anymore, you know?

1475
01:31:16,431 --> 01:31:19,460
And so I turned into, you know,
and like when I first went in,

1476
01:31:19,461 --> 01:31:22,340
I was like the kind of thought like,
man, this is going to be my new thing.

1477
01:31:22,341 --> 01:31:24,860
I'm going to get sober. And like, you
know, I'm going to be like, you know,

1478
01:31:24,920 --> 01:31:27,860
the world's going to kind of, Oh man, I'm
going to revive my career a little bit.

1479
01:31:28,160 --> 01:31:31,220
But once I got through that point of like,
you know,

1480
01:31:31,380 --> 01:31:36,230
like Sorta the fucking, uh, you know, the,

1481
01:31:36,231 --> 01:31:40,130
the dust settling and me being able to
maybe being confronted with what I had

1482
01:31:40,131 --> 01:31:43,790
turned into then it wasn't even about
what can I get out of it, you know,

1483
01:31:43,791 --> 01:31:46,220
it was just about I don't want
to be that fucking guy anymore.

1484
01:31:46,221 --> 01:31:50,330
And so I came out of that second rehabber
that's second psych ward and I was so

1485
01:31:50,331 --> 01:31:54,200
desperate to not be that fucking piece
of shit anymore. And I was like, dude,

1486
01:31:54,201 --> 01:31:57,560
I'm starting over. And I went into the
fucking, like, I went into another rehab,

1487
01:31:57,561 --> 01:32:01,570
like the fuck and, and guide the
hardcore, you know, and I was just like,

1488
01:32:01,571 --> 01:32:06,400
I'm doing this to be an I.
Like I had my priorities straight,

1489
01:32:06,480 --> 01:32:10,510
you know? And then I was there
for 60 days and I've been said,

1490
01:32:10,511 --> 01:32:12,520
by the time I finished
that it was six months.

1491
01:32:12,730 --> 01:32:15,480
And then I went into like the
regular sober living and so the,

1492
01:32:15,490 --> 01:32:18,780
there's a lot of fucking money
you're spending here. Yeah. The, the,

1493
01:32:18,790 --> 01:32:23,020
the last Rehab was seven,
a 7,500 per month.

1494
01:32:23,050 --> 01:32:26,250
So at least, uh, I, but yeah,

1495
01:32:26,280 --> 01:32:29,690
fucking it was like 30
grand that second rehab.

1496
01:32:29,710 --> 01:32:33,160
I heard of the second psych ward.
I spent a lot of money on it, man.

1497
01:32:33,161 --> 01:32:35,860
Fucking whatever. What are the guys
that you were in the apartment with?

1498
01:32:35,860 --> 01:32:39,490
What did those guys do for a living, but
they can't afford to live in this shot.

1499
01:32:39,550 --> 01:32:44,050
I paid the rent and I paid him age,
like 1000 bucks a month to do nothing.

1500
01:32:45,500 --> 01:32:48,100
Why did you pay him money
for what? Well, one guy was,

1501
01:32:48,110 --> 01:32:52,180
you said that like he was on call to edit
whatever footage like that, you know,

1502
01:32:52,181 --> 01:32:54,970
that uh, the, that I wanted edited,

1503
01:32:55,730 --> 01:33:00,400
like to help me broadcast my
downward spiral basically. You know,

1504
01:33:00,401 --> 01:33:02,140
like I put some really upsetting videos.

1505
01:33:02,141 --> 01:33:06,610
All the people that you were living in
the assisted situation like this is post

1506
01:33:06,730 --> 01:33:08,350
the major rehab,
right?

1507
01:33:08,351 --> 01:33:11,190
You were in the major rehab for three
days and then you'll be a part of the

1508
01:33:11,230 --> 01:33:16,120
brain. There's different levels of,
of uh, of rehabbing. Yeah. Like, um,

1509
01:33:16,960 --> 01:33:20,960
yeah and, and I wound up like back in,
yeah. I mean it was in the whole deal.

1510
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:23,950
At one point I was in a house for a
while and then sharing a bedroom with the

1511
01:33:23,951 --> 01:33:26,770
guy who snored and you know,
and I, and I, and, and you know,

1512
01:33:26,771 --> 01:33:30,100
at the end I was in the apartment,
but it was all the same deal.

1513
01:33:30,130 --> 01:33:33,220
What did these guys do for living that
they could afford to like take all this

1514
01:33:33,221 --> 01:33:37,840
time off of the sober living
situation was like, uh,

1515
01:33:38,370 --> 01:33:43,300
like that was like 1000 bucks
a month. And that covers like,

1516
01:33:43,301 --> 01:33:45,100
uh,
your meals as well.

1517
01:33:45,400 --> 01:33:48,340
So it's kind of more cost effective
than if you're going to try and find an

1518
01:33:48,341 --> 01:33:51,370
apartment or anything like that
in the sober living situation.

1519
01:33:51,400 --> 01:33:55,090
It's like these guys worked during the
day and they would come there and stay

1520
01:33:55,091 --> 01:33:58,860
with you. If you don't work, you have
to do a certain number of hours of, uh,

1521
01:33:59,110 --> 01:34:03,580
of service work. So I would
volunteer at a nursing home. Whoa.

1522
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:08,460
Yeah. It was dope man.
Like, uh, I would just go,

1523
01:34:08,470 --> 01:34:11,710
I'd go fucking hang out with old people
and pleading, I'd call the Bingo numbers.

1524
01:34:14,170 --> 01:34:15,480
Yeah.
And then,

1525
01:34:15,481 --> 01:34:20,481
and then I would like go and
fucking film a movie for paramount.

1526
01:34:21,670 --> 01:34:23,260
Like I'd be like, oh, hey guys,

1527
01:34:23,530 --> 01:34:26,860
I'm not going to be able to call Bingo
tomorrow because I'm going to be like

1528
01:34:26,890 --> 01:34:29,200
drinking a fat guys sweat.

1529
01:34:31,320 --> 01:34:36,320
So when did it feel like you were free
of the monkey when the phone was laying?

1530
01:34:36,881 --> 01:34:41,230
Never free of the mind can ever
right now you're not free. I mean,

1531
01:34:41,231 --> 01:34:42,350
whenever like,
um,

1532
01:34:43,340 --> 01:34:47,620
I just have like a way that
I live my life, you know,

1533
01:34:47,830 --> 01:34:52,240
that um, I still stay connected. It's
like a fridge man. You know? Like, uh,

1534
01:34:52,450 --> 01:34:55,810
if you unplug the fridge and then
everything and it's going to go rotten,

1535
01:34:55,930 --> 01:34:58,220
you know,
like you got to fucking stay plugged

1536
01:34:58,220 --> 01:35:01,940
in, which means that like these
things that, that we do to stay sober.

1537
01:35:01,941 --> 01:35:06,140
Like you just fucking keep doing well,
like helping other people stay sober.

1538
01:35:06,141 --> 01:35:08,890
It's like the biggest thing,
you know, like, you know,

1539
01:35:09,720 --> 01:35:14,720
you take people through their 12 steps
that you take through and you know them I

1540
01:35:14,950 --> 01:35:19,570
may or whatever, like you meet them sort
of in the community, you know, like a,

1541
01:35:19,690 --> 01:35:22,740
they'll ask you like, will
you be my sponsor? You know,

1542
01:35:22,741 --> 01:35:24,920
when you have a sponsor they call you
up in the middle of the night. Hey,

1543
01:35:24,921 --> 01:35:28,340
I'm thinking about doing heroin. Like
that kind of thing. Talking about that,

1544
01:35:28,341 --> 01:35:31,970
that is the idea. It's better to
call before you do it and then after,

1545
01:35:32,800 --> 01:35:35,240
cause there's no point in
talking to a load of dude.

1546
01:35:35,270 --> 01:35:37,460
And how often do you do this?
Like how often you work with,

1547
01:35:38,460 --> 01:35:42,250
uh, I mean it depends. Like most guys
like aren't like that active where there,

1548
01:35:42,260 --> 01:35:46,580
where they actually really call
a lot. But like, uh, you know, I,

1549
01:35:47,540 --> 01:35:50,680
I'm always starting a guy, you
know, there's always guys I,

1550
01:35:50,681 --> 01:35:55,681
I'm starting off and just very few of
them stick with it where they get the guys

1551
01:35:57,381 --> 01:36:01,360
have taken all the way through the steps.
There's been two,

1552
01:36:02,020 --> 01:36:04,190
two out of how many,
oh my God.

1553
01:36:05,020 --> 01:36:09,160
Well over a hundred. So a hundred people,
two of them would become totally sober.

1554
01:36:09,900 --> 01:36:13,180
Um,
I mean they've been like a

1555
01:36:13,770 --> 01:36:16,570
say totally sober. I mean you're totally
sober and as long as you're younger,

1556
01:36:16,610 --> 01:36:20,590
not loaded right now. Um,

1557
01:36:22,250 --> 01:36:25,940
one guy got all the way through the steps,
but then he's, he's drinking again. So,

1558
01:36:26,720 --> 01:36:28,550
you know,
I got one,

1559
01:36:28,551 --> 01:36:32,030
I got one guy that's been all the way
through the steps that still in do you

1560
01:36:32,031 --> 01:36:32,471
think,

1561
01:36:32,471 --> 01:36:36,440
are you one of those people that thinks
that if you were a junkie that you have

1562
01:36:36,441 --> 01:36:40,900
to be sober forever? Like you can't,
you can't go back to, like you say,

1563
01:36:40,901 --> 01:36:45,500
if you had a heroin problem, you can't
drink it. Say once he become a pickle,

1564
01:36:45,501 --> 01:36:47,360
you never go back to being a cucumber.

1565
01:36:49,290 --> 01:36:52,980
So yeah, like, like, uh, like there's
no, if I pick up a drink or I'd drag,

1566
01:36:52,981 --> 01:36:53,814
I'm fucked.

1567
01:36:54,610 --> 01:36:57,130
If I decided I'll pick up
exactly where I left off.

1568
01:36:57,460 --> 01:37:01,750
But I know that all I want is like to
make sure I'm doing enough drugs that

1569
01:37:01,751 --> 01:37:05,680
people are walking around my
fucking apartment in my house,

1570
01:37:05,740 --> 01:37:07,780
the who are not actually there.

1571
01:37:08,050 --> 01:37:11,920
But I know people that used to be like
heroin addicts that can have beer.

1572
01:37:12,010 --> 01:37:14,170
They can smoke a little wind,
they can get away with it, man.

1573
01:37:14,171 --> 01:37:16,270
Then then power to them.
It's dangerous.

1574
01:37:18,090 --> 01:37:21,670
Why is it dangerous though? I mean,
if they're free of it, like, okay,

1575
01:37:21,671 --> 01:37:25,000
here's a perfect example. Anthony
Bordain. He was a heroin addict.

1576
01:37:25,060 --> 01:37:27,970
He was a junkie full on,
you still look to have a beer.

1577
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:31,390
He looks to Jim doesn't drink at home.
Perry Farrell I think is like that.

1578
01:37:31,510 --> 01:37:34,570
You know, you can't have heroin, a
debate, drinks, wine or whatever. Hey man,

1579
01:37:34,571 --> 01:37:35,980
power to him.
But uh,

1580
01:37:36,010 --> 01:37:39,580
but for you it's not a
long line alcoholics man.

1581
01:37:39,581 --> 01:37:43,660
Like the way that my family is
structured, there might, my lineage,

1582
01:37:44,990 --> 01:37:48,390
like dad was like a broken mold
of his fam. Dad comes from right

1583
01:37:48,450 --> 01:37:51,030
line of,
of like

1584
01:37:51,770 --> 01:37:55,740
academics, like PhDs,
scholars, theologians,

1585
01:37:55,780 --> 01:37:56,940
zoologists

1586
01:37:57,360 --> 01:38:01,920
like, and he broke the mold of his family
by becoming a businessman and a super

1587
01:38:01,921 --> 01:38:05,160
successful one at that
Mom's side of the family.

1588
01:38:05,580 --> 01:38:10,410
Everybody is alcoholic and drug addict,
gambler and suicide.

1589
01:38:10,440 --> 01:38:15,270
How'd your mom and dad, me, um, pardon?
She was super hot. You know, like,

1590
01:38:15,271 --> 01:38:17,850
um, but yeah, so like every,

1591
01:38:17,890 --> 01:38:22,380
I mean everybody in my mom's side of
the family is either dead or dying from

1592
01:38:22,381 --> 01:38:26,280
alcoholism. I would say I, me and
my cousins, I guess, I don't know.

1593
01:38:26,281 --> 01:38:30,410
My one cousin is a mortician.
Yeah.

1594
01:38:30,420 --> 01:38:33,030
I went to clown college,
I went to clown college.

1595
01:38:33,031 --> 01:38:37,650
He went to mortician school at the
same time. Went to clown college,

1596
01:38:37,740 --> 01:38:41,400
Ringling brothers and Barnum and Bailey
clown college for real. Yeah. You do.

1597
01:38:42,330 --> 01:38:46,910
This is an exploding
shoe. Well, like whenever,

1598
01:38:46,920 --> 01:38:48,990
like I said,
I left the University of Miami.

1599
01:38:48,991 --> 01:38:51,300
I wanted to become a
crazy stunt man and a,

1600
01:38:51,301 --> 01:38:53,820
and all I really accomplished
like with that, you know,

1601
01:38:53,821 --> 01:38:56,700
even with all my crazy skills
is drinking bottled water.

1602
01:38:56,701 --> 01:39:00,770
Like I couldn't get a job like,
and uh,

1603
01:39:00,880 --> 01:39:02,810
and so she was like
homeless for three years.

1604
01:39:02,811 --> 01:39:06,420
He's getting arrested and fucking
hospitalized almost for three years.

1605
01:39:06,450 --> 01:39:08,220
While I was couch surfing for three years,

1606
01:39:08,221 --> 01:39:12,210
I had the government has money or to
try and test drugs on me for money.

1607
01:39:13,390 --> 01:39:17,160
And I mean,
they do medical studies for like a,

1608
01:39:17,570 --> 01:39:19,530
they'd be medical studies for whatever,
you know,

1609
01:39:19,531 --> 01:39:21,630
like if it's going to come in
contact with the human body,

1610
01:39:21,631 --> 01:39:24,240
like if it's a toothpaste or something,
they've got to do a medical study,

1611
01:39:24,510 --> 01:39:27,030
but if it's a toothpaste and
you're not going to get paid shit,

1612
01:39:27,430 --> 01:39:31,530
if it's fucking drugs for pigs and cows,
then then you're going to get the,

1613
01:39:31,610 --> 01:39:35,600
based on how dangerous the study is,
the more money you get.

1614
01:39:35,610 --> 01:39:40,610
And so I wouldn't sign up for to have
drugs for pigs and cows touching on me,

1615
01:39:42,530 --> 01:39:45,690
which I, which I recently
found out the drugs was banned.

1616
01:39:45,750 --> 01:39:48,200
Jesus fucking Christ is like,

1617
01:39:48,930 --> 01:39:53,850
this was in like 19 the in January of
94 you're like a house that you like,

1618
01:39:53,851 --> 01:39:57,060
you get to the back. When woke
we this the last door. Hold on.

1619
01:39:58,950 --> 01:40:03,820
Oh Jesus. A whole nother house.
Yeah, it was like they, they,

1620
01:40:03,821 --> 01:40:06,690
they want like the, you
know, 1994 like whatever,

1621
01:40:06,691 --> 01:40:09,020
the January of [inaudible]
94 and they had,

1622
01:40:09,021 --> 01:40:14,021
they wanted to pass this drug through
the FDA called ractopamine hydrochloride.

1623
01:40:17,130 --> 01:40:19,230
And the goal of that,
they didn't know much about it.

1624
01:40:19,260 --> 01:40:23,970
Said they knew they would make the
cattle like a more lean like a,

1625
01:40:23,980 --> 01:40:26,130
it wouldn't like increase the muscle mass,

1626
01:40:26,131 --> 01:40:31,131
decreased the fat so and but it would
work the opposite way of steroids somehow.

1627
01:40:31,590 --> 01:40:35,640
And like there was so that they could
appeal to a more kind of health conscious

1628
01:40:35,641 --> 01:40:39,090
and market. They could sell like
leaner meat, you know, less fat.

1629
01:40:39,570 --> 01:40:42,750
But the thing is that if it's going to
become legal then like by the virtue of

1630
01:40:42,751 --> 01:40:44,340
the fact that when people eat the meat,

1631
01:40:44,520 --> 01:40:48,660
they're going to get like a minute trace
of this drug in the, in the, you know,

1632
01:40:48,661 --> 01:40:49,494
the meat.

1633
01:40:49,530 --> 01:40:54,100
Now they have to not only test the drug
on people but they have to test like how

1634
01:40:54,101 --> 01:40:56,600
much can the people withstand shock.

1635
01:40:56,940 --> 01:40:59,660
So like they knew them,

1636
01:41:00,790 --> 01:41:04,870
they knew that it was going
to like increase our heart
rates. Like uh, you know,

1637
01:41:04,871 --> 01:41:05,820
and so what they,
the,

1638
01:41:05,821 --> 01:41:10,821
the target for this study was to give it
to us until somebody in this study had

1639
01:41:12,821 --> 01:41:17,170
their resting heart rate.
Like laying down, resting.
I'm like 150 beats a minute,

1640
01:41:17,680 --> 01:41:18,513
like,
um,

1641
01:41:18,850 --> 01:41:22,570
and it turned out that I had like the
fucking most bad ass hard in the study.

1642
01:41:22,610 --> 01:41:27,610
Like the only time I went over a hundred
was when the guy like monitoring my

1643
01:41:28,001 --> 01:41:30,690
heart with like the ultrasound
thing and then, you know, like, uh,

1644
01:41:30,810 --> 01:41:33,280
the show the baby on the screen.
Like I,

1645
01:41:33,281 --> 01:41:37,210
he was like telling me stories about like
killing people in Vietnam or some shit.

1646
01:41:38,660 --> 01:41:42,070
He was like, if some
like, uh, you know, yeah.

1647
01:41:42,071 --> 01:41:46,330
It was like God told me like war stories
and that got my heart like, uh, you know,

1648
01:41:46,331 --> 01:41:49,810
I'll have a normally like, like what
kind of stories? I can't remember.

1649
01:41:49,811 --> 01:41:53,050
It was just like he was in the war and
he killed people and I was telling you

1650
01:41:53,051 --> 01:41:58,000
what he's doing an ultrasound of your
heart. Yeah. And it's the same guy,

1651
01:41:58,001 --> 01:42:00,670
the same guy when he was looking at it,
showed like your blood,

1652
01:42:00,671 --> 01:42:05,110
like going in your heart like a red and
coming out of your heart blew like on

1653
01:42:05,111 --> 01:42:09,580
the screen. It was really
fucking cool. And, uh, and I
just had like a strong heart,

1654
01:42:09,581 --> 01:42:14,120
you know, she's like me. He said, man,
what a squeeze, you know, like eat out.

1655
01:42:14,300 --> 01:42:19,050
Like what a squeeze. I got two guys. Yeah.

1656
01:42:19,120 --> 01:42:23,590
And I was, I was homeless anyways, so
like they LG g I did that in Austin,

1657
01:42:23,591 --> 01:42:26,170
Texas too. Yeah. That was an Austin,

1658
01:42:26,171 --> 01:42:30,580
Texas at this place called Pharmaco Lsr
second. I told you I got in the van,

1659
01:42:30,630 --> 01:42:33,790
that guy, and we drove ads
in northern California to a,

1660
01:42:33,850 --> 01:42:35,860
to Lake Tahoe to try and get jobs,

1661
01:42:35,861 --> 01:42:39,760
Washington dishes at squaw valley
to get free snowboard passes,

1662
01:42:39,940 --> 01:42:40,960
but it wasn't snowing.

1663
01:42:40,990 --> 01:42:45,880
So then we went to fucking Colorado and
I got a job like cleaning a meat room at

1664
01:42:45,881 --> 01:42:47,630
a supermarket and that sucked.

1665
01:42:47,631 --> 01:42:50,200
So I'll go one with this other
dude and drove to Austin,

1666
01:42:50,201 --> 01:42:53,800
Texas and slept on a roof until
we got into the medical study.

1667
01:42:53,801 --> 01:42:58,030
And then we left with two grand and we
were stoked. And then like, you know,

1668
01:42:58,040 --> 01:43:01,240
end up like getting a car and following
the grateful dead and selling drugs.

1669
01:43:01,241 --> 01:43:04,930
And Geez, my gosh. And I was homeless
for like three years. And, um,

1670
01:43:05,530 --> 01:43:09,640
and like periodically I'd get my hands
on cameras and do really fucked up shit.

1671
01:43:09,640 --> 01:43:14,200
But you know, I was getting video footage
but like ultimately like, you know,

1672
01:43:14,201 --> 01:43:16,420
I just fucking, it was really
bombed dude. It wasn't,

1673
01:43:16,421 --> 01:43:18,530
I didn't like after three years
I couldn't take any more night.

1674
01:43:18,640 --> 01:43:23,110
I reached out to my sister and she led
me move in with her and Albuquerque and I

1675
01:43:23,111 --> 01:43:26,680
was like, I would eat all her
food and I wouldn't fucking work.

1676
01:43:26,681 --> 01:43:28,270
I had no money and if I did have money,

1677
01:43:28,271 --> 01:43:30,430
I was loaded and I was loud
and I was like, you know,

1678
01:43:30,670 --> 01:43:34,300
so when my sister found out about Ringling
brothers and Barnum and Bailey clown

1679
01:43:34,301 --> 01:43:36,040
college, she's like, dude,

1680
01:43:36,041 --> 01:43:40,750
this could be the way to get my
brother the fuck out of my house. Like,

1681
01:43:40,751 --> 01:43:43,720
so like she told me about it.
Like I got home and she's like,

1682
01:43:43,721 --> 01:43:45,570
how are you getting to Denver by Monday?
And I,

1683
01:43:45,880 --> 01:43:50,350
I hitchhiked from Albuquerque to Denver
and I got there in two rides and just

1684
01:43:50,351 --> 01:43:54,200
fucking went ape shit. If you've
written a book. Uh Huh. Okay.

1685
01:43:54,440 --> 01:43:57,300
Is this all in the book? Totally.
Did my blood and my books.

1686
01:43:57,301 --> 01:44:00,140
I got it barely made the New
York Times bestseller list.

1687
01:44:00,230 --> 01:44:03,770
That's because you didn't come on
here first. Probably. Yeah, I can.

1688
01:44:03,890 --> 01:44:06,440
If people had heard these fucking
stories and knew that they were in the,

1689
01:44:07,340 --> 01:44:10,760
oh my God barely made the best
New York Times bestseller list.

1690
01:44:10,761 --> 01:44:15,130
But what I'm most proud of my book,
cause my masterpiece man, like um,

1691
01:44:15,440 --> 01:44:18,140
on Amazon it's got like the,
the,

1692
01:44:18,150 --> 01:44:22,390
the key middle of average rating is
a four or five out of five stars.

1693
01:44:22,391 --> 01:44:26,870
There's fucking partial
starts. Even people who hate
me and want to hate my book,

1694
01:44:26,900 --> 01:44:30,110
give it a fucking fives. Tried it
yourself. I've worked with a writer on it,

1695
01:44:30,111 --> 01:44:30,570
but uh,

1696
01:44:30,570 --> 01:44:34,310
but I don't think anybody has like been
more involved in the collaboration.

1697
01:44:34,311 --> 01:44:38,300
Like we bounced, we bounced out that
shit back and forth. I'm like, dude,

1698
01:44:38,301 --> 01:44:41,000
I would never use that word.
I don't, you know, like I,

1699
01:44:41,070 --> 01:44:45,770
I worked my dick off on that fucking book.
Your stories fucking insane.

1700
01:44:45,771 --> 01:44:49,850
It's like, it just has layers
upon layers, you know? That's,

1701
01:44:49,851 --> 01:44:53,790
and that's kind of like, what's dope
about the fucking like the, the,

1702
01:44:53,791 --> 01:44:57,980
the comedy show man. I'm just like really
bombed, like to retire like my shit,

1703
01:44:57,981 --> 01:45:00,140
you know, like how you retiring?
What do you mean? Well, you know,

1704
01:45:00,141 --> 01:45:03,160
like you were tired material once
the fucking special comes out. Yeah.

1705
01:45:03,180 --> 01:45:07,970
We make new stuff.
Of course want to be cartoony for growth.

1706
01:45:08,030 --> 01:45:10,130
Right?
You want to be a comedy factory,

1707
01:45:10,131 --> 01:45:14,600
not a comedy warehouse when we look at it.
Yeah.

1708
01:45:14,601 --> 01:45:17,900
That's the only way to look at your comedy
should kind of represent who you are

1709
01:45:17,901 --> 01:45:18,734
right now. Well, yeah,

1710
01:45:18,770 --> 01:45:21,770
and that's why 20 years ago it doesn't
really represent who you are. Right.

1711
01:45:21,771 --> 01:45:24,680
Of course. Like the whole like,
I don't fucking, like I told you,

1712
01:45:24,681 --> 01:45:28,670
it's like the history is like super
condensed, you know, like, uh, you know,

1713
01:45:28,740 --> 01:45:30,230
so it's like funny.

1714
01:45:31,250 --> 01:45:35,030
And with the story points I like on
story points I have like when I say like

1715
01:45:35,031 --> 01:45:38,240
about how graduated from Ringling brothers
and Barnum and Bailey clown college,

1716
01:45:38,570 --> 01:45:43,310
but like I wasn't one of the clowns who
got fucking contract with the circus

1717
01:45:43,450 --> 01:45:47,060
side, like borrow money to get a fucking
greyhound bus back to Albuquerque,

1718
01:45:47,061 --> 01:45:52,061
New Mexico where I hung my fancy clown
costume in the fucking closet and sold

1719
01:45:52,431 --> 01:45:56,990
shitty weed and the bags of fucking weed
I sold did not weigh anywhere near what

1720
01:45:56,991 --> 01:46:01,260
they were supposed to weigh in my
life. Fucking sucked. Really bad, bad.

1721
01:46:01,261 --> 01:46:03,620
After I got done ripping you off,

1722
01:46:03,621 --> 01:46:08,510
like at least I would show you like a
fucking epic. Unbelievable cool trick.

1723
01:46:08,840 --> 01:46:12,440
Like this one. And then like on that
point like, well fucking bring the,

1724
01:46:12,530 --> 01:46:15,410
bring the thing like the table out and
I'm going to fucking show you the most

1725
01:46:15,411 --> 01:46:19,190
incredible bar chick ever. So when did
you, when did you put this book out?

1726
01:46:19,810 --> 01:46:24,590
A 2011 did you go on the full tour?
Do all these radio shows and I mean,

1727
01:46:24,591 --> 01:46:29,360
I did like radio tour, like a, I'd never
went on Howard Stern, like, uh, we'll see.

1728
01:46:29,361 --> 01:46:32,750
That must have helped. Yeah. I mean
it didn't do like terrible, you know,

1729
01:46:32,810 --> 01:46:37,810
but just like you need like a platform
where you could just talk for hours and

1730
01:46:38,480 --> 01:46:41,350
hours and hours. Right. It'd be cool
if I had like a podcast too. I just,

1731
01:46:41,360 --> 01:46:45,380
like you were saying, right, ma'am, I'm
everybody's tired of Comico and dude,

1732
01:46:45,381 --> 01:46:49,980
you should have a podcast, right? So
t shirt that says, dude, you should

1733
01:46:49,980 --> 01:46:53,440
have a podcast. So I've said it to
so many people, but does anybody,

1734
01:46:54,240 --> 01:46:57,770
like a lot of those fucking
people took you up on it?

1735
01:46:59,430 --> 01:47:03,690
Not every podcast, just the Joe Rogan
experience. Did, you know, like,

1736
01:47:03,691 --> 01:47:07,440
it's the most fucking annoying question
ever. Like, Hey, will you do my podcasts?

1737
01:47:08,210 --> 01:47:12,350
You know, when you get cornered by your
body and like, yeah, some people were,

1738
01:47:13,530 --> 01:47:16,850
they did not. But it's one of those
things we got to kind of work at it.

1739
01:47:16,870 --> 01:47:18,420
It doesn't seem like
you have to work on it,

1740
01:47:18,660 --> 01:47:20,820
like standards standup
sort of the same way.

1741
01:47:20,821 --> 01:47:22,770
Of course we're doing
kill Tony last night.

1742
01:47:22,800 --> 01:47:24,030
It's one of the things
I wanted to tell people.

1743
01:47:24,031 --> 01:47:27,570
Like it seems like it's just you talking,

1744
01:47:27,571 --> 01:47:30,910
but you have to figure out how people
are perceiving you and, and that's,

1745
01:47:30,990 --> 01:47:34,320
that's a big part of doing a podcast too.
But you would be really good at it.

1746
01:47:36,110 --> 01:47:39,870
It would be good man. He just did
like one a week. You'd probably,

1747
01:47:39,871 --> 01:47:44,520
it would take you a year or two
to run out of stories. I, I mean,

1748
01:47:44,521 --> 01:47:47,430
not even necessarily like who knows if
like if you're going to tell us stories

1749
01:47:47,431 --> 01:47:50,390
about shit that happened or what's
going on. Yeah. Man, this dude.

1750
01:47:50,880 --> 01:47:54,180
Do you have like a guy that you could do
it with? We could bounce shit off them.

1751
01:47:54,610 --> 01:47:57,810
Do you have a good buddy that you
thought about? Like, well with,

1752
01:47:57,990 --> 01:48:02,490
I've thought about doing it,
you know, there's this fucking
platform, this uh, this,

1753
01:48:02,491 --> 01:48:04,290
um,
which we call it a,

1754
01:48:04,291 --> 01:48:09,190
it's caught you now and one
of these streaming things
like periscope or Meerkat,

1755
01:48:09,630 --> 01:48:12,370
but like,
fuck dude,

1756
01:48:12,390 --> 01:48:15,090
this is so crazy like you now.

1757
01:48:15,091 --> 01:48:19,140
And like everybody who is
a user of this platform,

1758
01:48:19,620 --> 01:48:23,100
I kept like, it has an account
that they like put money into.

1759
01:48:23,430 --> 01:48:26,850
And so the way it works is
like why you're streaming leg,

1760
01:48:27,130 --> 01:48:30,460
like their questions show up and they
want to get an answer to their question.

1761
01:48:30,461 --> 01:48:31,110
So they'll like,

1762
01:48:31,110 --> 01:48:36,110
they have like different denominations
of like money that they like give you

1763
01:48:36,680 --> 01:48:40,200
like cam girl.
Now I swear dude,

1764
01:48:41,260 --> 01:48:45,180
my agents, my agents like, like bullied
me into doing it and I've tried it right.

1765
01:48:45,181 --> 01:48:49,980
And I just sat there like just tell him
stories to like the fans that were on

1766
01:48:50,010 --> 01:48:52,410
fucking watching and my by the end,

1767
01:48:52,411 --> 01:48:57,411
but I was on there for like 39 minutes
and then I fucking ended the stream.

1768
01:48:57,811 --> 01:49:00,480
And it's like you just made $1,000

1769
01:49:02,600 --> 01:49:07,330
felt like a fucking pan handler
is very cam girl ask. Yeah.

1770
01:49:07,380 --> 01:49:08,850
But if you did that all the time,

1771
01:49:08,851 --> 01:49:11,760
it would probably at least pay for
a studio if you set up a studio.

1772
01:49:11,761 --> 01:49:14,730
So I mean for sure, but
you don't want, see,

1773
01:49:15,060 --> 01:49:19,570
you don't want to people to have to
pay to ask you questions. Like I said,

1774
01:49:19,571 --> 01:49:21,150
it felt like a fucking panhandler.

1775
01:49:21,250 --> 01:49:24,570
I hate it and I haven't done
it since I did this show.

1776
01:49:24,571 --> 01:49:28,110
And the guy who promoted the
show, uh, I didn't know about it.

1777
01:49:28,111 --> 01:49:32,430
Something to Brian counts set up. This
guy, that guy, what a fucking guy.

1778
01:49:32,460 --> 01:49:35,680
But this guy had set it
up and I love Brian Tube.

1779
01:49:35,690 --> 01:49:38,670
He doesn't pay attention to shit.
It's not like real good with details.

1780
01:49:38,671 --> 01:49:40,830
I had to ask them a bunch of questions
about the shell. Like, hey man,

1781
01:49:41,040 --> 01:49:45,360
there's a guy who's a Dj who is saying
that he's spinning records in between us

1782
01:49:45,360 --> 01:49:49,060
a week. Is there a fucking break in
between us? Where does a DJ come on? Ah,

1783
01:49:49,061 --> 01:49:52,480
I'll check. I'll check. It's just you and
I. I get there. It's not just me and him.

1784
01:49:52,481 --> 01:49:56,380
It's me.
Him does a fucking MC three local comics.

1785
01:49:56,381 --> 01:49:59,320
A girl's doing 20 minutes
and it was a disaster.

1786
01:49:59,320 --> 01:50:02,830
We had to clean up this giant mask. It's
podcasts. No, no, no. It's a comedy show.

1787
01:50:02,831 --> 01:50:03,664
But anyway,

1788
01:50:03,880 --> 01:50:08,880
the guy had made people pay extra to take
pictures to meet us and take pictures.

1789
01:50:09,640 --> 01:50:14,500
Exactly. And I said, do you can't do that?
I would never, I would never do that.

1790
01:50:14,501 --> 01:50:17,710
And you can't do that. You can't do that.
It's fun. I take pictures with everybody.

1791
01:50:18,060 --> 01:50:21,970
I'll do a theater and I'll wait for
hours and I'll show you pictures with a

1792
01:50:21,970 --> 01:50:25,570
thousand fucking people. Like you
can't charge people an extra 20 bucks.

1793
01:50:25,571 --> 01:50:30,070
Take pictures of me on his own.
He did it on his own as a promoter,

1794
01:50:30,190 --> 01:50:33,130
and this is all shit that calendars
didn't pay attention to the way,

1795
01:50:33,260 --> 01:50:37,240
the way I do that. And, and Ryan's cool
about taking pictures as well. Yeah, no,

1796
01:50:37,241 --> 01:50:39,220
he was totally cool.
He just didn't pay attention.

1797
01:50:39,550 --> 01:50:42,310
He just let this guy
handle everything we will.

1798
01:50:42,310 --> 01:50:45,340
Who we did need in the first place. You
know, what do you, what do you need?

1799
01:50:45,341 --> 01:50:49,360
He's doing it. We don't need a promoter.
This is Twitter. That's the promoter,

1800
01:50:49,560 --> 01:50:52,480
you know, let people know you're there.
They show up. It's not that hard.

1801
01:50:52,630 --> 01:50:55,660
Like what does this promoter in
quotes doing, what is he doing?

1802
01:50:55,930 --> 01:50:59,200
He's just trying to get his friends on
the show and trying to charge extra to

1803
01:50:59,201 --> 01:51:02,800
take pictures.
It was stupid but that's a gross model.

1804
01:51:02,801 --> 01:51:07,801
Like the model of like people having to
pay for VIP entrance or all that gross

1805
01:51:08,831 --> 01:51:11,160
shit and meet and greet the,
um,

1806
01:51:11,320 --> 01:51:15,040
the one thing that is the cell phone
pictures like take fucking forever.

1807
01:51:15,680 --> 01:51:17,750
So what I do is I have my,

1808
01:51:17,840 --> 01:51:22,840
my website where I'd take the pictures
of myself and like when when the fucking

1809
01:51:23,320 --> 01:51:26,560
I'm so good at it and I stole your idea.
We stole that.

1810
01:51:26,561 --> 01:51:30,000
Jamie comes with me to some shows and
takes pictures and we thought that it's

1811
01:51:30,010 --> 01:51:31,870
better. Yeah, it takes way quicker.

1812
01:51:31,880 --> 01:51:35,830
It's like one third the time better
too if you take them yourself.

1813
01:51:35,831 --> 01:51:37,350
Because that way when the flash goes off,

1814
01:51:37,360 --> 01:51:39,940
you turn the camera around and you can
show the people their pictures so they

1815
01:51:39,941 --> 01:51:41,860
can see it for like,
why do the quality control,

1816
01:51:41,861 --> 01:51:46,280
don't let him say it because then they'd
go, oh my God, take that again. Oh my God,

1817
01:51:46,300 --> 01:51:47,920
I do it.
Oh my God.

1818
01:51:48,590 --> 01:51:52,000
Cause girls who like looking at photos
of themselves and everything's great.

1819
01:51:52,001 --> 01:51:55,600
Like, oh my God, I hate that picture.
Do it again. Yeah. But no, no, no.

1820
01:51:55,601 --> 01:51:59,560
This is what you look like. Yeah. But
that's the thing is that like for me like,

1821
01:51:59,570 --> 01:52:02,830
uh, I I my cameras so fast that
you're like, oh no. Okay, boom.

1822
01:52:02,980 --> 01:52:06,550
I half the time Alan like, oh you
don't like it, I don't like it.

1823
01:52:06,551 --> 01:52:07,390
So I'll take another one.

1824
01:52:08,140 --> 01:52:12,610
Whatever invite might be picky and
I don't like the way my teeth look.

1825
01:52:13,090 --> 01:52:16,600
So, so the fucking like, um,

1826
01:52:16,690 --> 01:52:19,130
and I just wanted the people
to and be really like Hap,

1827
01:52:19,131 --> 01:52:21,280
I getting a bunch of cheese fry man.
Like,

1828
01:52:21,281 --> 01:52:24,220
I want them to be super happy with it
because I know that when they fucking go

1829
01:52:24,221 --> 01:52:25,320
to my website and pull it did,

1830
01:52:25,321 --> 01:52:29,460
they're going to post it on their fucking
all their social media and I know that

1831
01:52:29,470 --> 01:52:31,480
they're going to post it. And
then, yeah. And then that's,

1832
01:52:31,481 --> 01:52:34,720
that's sort of my grassroots
way of letting people know
what the fuck I'm doing.

1833
01:52:34,840 --> 01:52:37,500
Yeah, no, it's smart move. And I started
doing it right after I heard you did it.

1834
01:52:37,501 --> 01:52:41,050
I think Brian told me about it.
And a bunch of people do that now.

1835
01:52:41,210 --> 01:52:44,050
It's April does that too,
right? It doesn't. Gabriel
Garcia to something like that.

1836
01:52:44,090 --> 01:52:46,010
Similar to a smart,
right at the end of

1837
01:52:46,010 --> 01:52:47,980
every show I said, okay,
now I'm going to like, uh,

1838
01:52:48,050 --> 01:52:51,200
before I do my last fucking amazing stone,
I'm going to do,

1839
01:52:52,850 --> 01:52:56,030
I want to thank you guys for coming out
and giving me a shot at stand up and you

1840
01:52:56,031 --> 01:52:59,620
know, I'm going to fucking, when I walk
off the stage, I'm not going anywhere. Um,

1841
01:52:59,690 --> 01:53:03,010
so I'd take a photo with every single
one of you guys and here's how you get

1842
01:53:03,011 --> 01:53:07,250
them to go to my fucking website.
And I explain it really easy and I say it.

1843
01:53:07,370 --> 01:53:10,130
And one last thing, if you want to
get out of here a little quicker,

1844
01:53:10,400 --> 01:53:14,540
the good news is I'm a New York Times
bestselling author and I've got my fucking

1845
01:53:14,570 --> 01:53:17,540
my book and I've got my fucking,
like my hats, my shirts,

1846
01:53:17,900 --> 01:53:20,480
and if you guys want to
get any of this shit,

1847
01:53:20,800 --> 01:53:24,020
then that puts you to the front of the
lions have been emerge line and then a

1848
01:53:24,021 --> 01:53:26,050
photo.
So like,

1849
01:53:26,060 --> 01:53:30,830
so there's so many merge line first to
get to the photo for the gift shop and

1850
01:53:30,831 --> 01:53:34,520
it's like, it's fucking
Disneyland. That's the thing.

1851
01:53:34,790 --> 01:53:37,460
I'm still going to take a picture
with every single fucking person.

1852
01:53:37,820 --> 01:53:41,270
It's just having to take a picture of
the people or by March 1st you know?

1853
01:53:41,480 --> 01:53:45,650
And so like a lot of people would,
would be like, oh well fuck man. Like,

1854
01:53:46,040 --> 01:53:47,680
I don't want to, you
know, and I tell him egg,

1855
01:53:47,690 --> 01:53:49,250
if you don't want to get
anything that's great,

1856
01:53:49,251 --> 01:53:51,860
but please just let me hang
out and like have a drink,

1857
01:53:51,861 --> 01:53:55,400
whatever lipid and just fucking stick
around and get that picture so I can thank

1858
01:53:55,401 --> 01:53:59,810
you in person. And a lot of people
will think like, man, like, you know,

1859
01:53:59,811 --> 01:54:01,240
I want to get a picture.
You know,

1860
01:54:01,250 --> 01:54:04,010
it wasn't no really want to
buy anything but like fuck it.

1861
01:54:04,040 --> 01:54:05,810
I'll just buy something to
get the fuck out of here.

1862
01:54:05,811 --> 01:54:09,050
So you ended up selling like
way more merged, you know,

1863
01:54:09,500 --> 01:54:11,420
and nobody feels like you're a dick.
You know,

1864
01:54:11,421 --> 01:54:14,960
he's still stick around and take a photo
with every, every one in the fuckers.

1865
01:54:15,230 --> 01:54:19,670
The only problem was sewing things is
you got a deal with people like $20 dude.

1866
01:54:19,820 --> 01:54:22,880
Like those people like oh right,
but how many,

1867
01:54:24,050 --> 01:54:29,050
how many people are out there by
selling fucking a one fucking side,

1868
01:54:29,541 --> 01:54:34,340
one color fucking shirt for 35 40 bucks.
Like Andrew dice clay.

1869
01:54:34,341 --> 01:54:37,880
So it smells like a fucking
one color screen. Five shirts.

1870
01:54:38,700 --> 01:54:43,340
He actually brings like five shirts and
he auctions them off. Oh, I don't know.

1871
01:54:43,350 --> 01:54:48,290
I never heard about that. Shirts for
like $500 and I mean, and that's,

1872
01:54:49,250 --> 01:54:52,220
yeah, I charge, I charge
20 bucks for, for whatever,

1873
01:54:52,221 --> 01:54:55,100
but I sign every last fucking the,
should I say like, hey, you know,

1874
01:54:55,370 --> 01:54:59,750
you can have a five star in New York
Times bestseller that's autographed by the

1875
01:54:59,751 --> 01:55:03,060
author and a picture and 20 bucks.
I don't feel bad about it. No. Look,

1876
01:55:03,080 --> 01:55:05,990
it's great for a book for
20 bucks is a great deal.

1877
01:55:05,991 --> 01:55:10,991
You think about the amount of time it's
caused book about a time that you spend

1878
01:55:11,181 --> 01:55:14,950
being entertained by that book,
the greatest bargain ever. Yeah,

1879
01:55:14,951 --> 01:55:19,190
I lost take days to read, you
know? Yeah. I love that shit man.

1880
01:55:19,400 --> 01:55:23,350
But in any case, I'm so sideman that you
have like as much of a reach as you did,

1881
01:55:23,360 --> 01:55:24,230
man,
because I really,

1882
01:55:24,830 --> 01:55:28,790
we got to fucking get this paramount
theater in Austin fucking packed, man.

1883
01:55:29,240 --> 01:55:31,610
I'm going to like, that show is
going to be like, that's why.

1884
01:55:31,670 --> 01:55:35,330
That's why I show times to leave here
and your phone's going to be buzzing off

1885
01:55:35,331 --> 01:55:36,680
the hook with your manager going.

1886
01:55:36,681 --> 01:55:38,810
Did you say you going to
light the paramount on fire?

1887
01:55:43,130 --> 01:55:44,250
It's a huge stage.

1888
01:55:44,250 --> 01:55:47,430
And like, dude, they told me one time
to get out of the room. Don't worry,

1889
01:55:48,360 --> 01:55:51,480
everybody will eat you alive.
No great white.

1890
01:55:51,510 --> 01:55:55,890
There was like 23 people that
just died recently. Fire on stage.

1891
01:55:57,060 --> 01:56:00,720
It just happened again. We're two
people in the band even died where uh,

1892
01:56:01,910 --> 01:56:06,660
yeah, it's just like great whites. Uh,
it was it Sweden or something happened.

1893
01:56:06,661 --> 01:56:10,290
It's sparked on the side stage and
immediately the whole place caught on fire

1894
01:56:10,870 --> 01:56:15,270
wait techniques. Pyrotechnics.
Dude, it's not worth it.

1895
01:56:15,271 --> 01:56:16,650
We used to have those in the UFC.

1896
01:56:16,651 --> 01:56:19,500
We just have these fucking giant
like opening shows. Actually,

1897
01:56:19,501 --> 01:56:23,210
I don't think we had, yeah, we did
have fire believe, but uh, in, um,

1898
01:56:23,430 --> 01:56:25,050
Joel de Oliveira,
I was like,

1899
01:56:25,051 --> 01:56:28,650
it's a famous fighter from Brazil
and he was fighting in pride and they

1900
01:56:28,651 --> 01:56:33,210
accidentally lit them on fire and uh,
he was on his way to the,

1901
01:56:33,230 --> 01:56:34,560
to the ring and you know,

1902
01:56:34,561 --> 01:56:37,440
they do the boom when you're
walking through like this gateway,

1903
01:56:37,650 --> 01:56:40,050
they liked the fight and they,
they fucked up the timing.

1904
01:56:40,050 --> 01:56:44,250
They lit this fucking dude on fire as
he's on his way into the ring and burnt

1905
01:56:44,251 --> 01:56:49,230
them. And then they said, oh, you'll be
back me give you a more money. And so,

1906
01:56:49,280 --> 01:56:50,760
you know,
it took like a year off,

1907
01:56:50,820 --> 01:56:54,510
healed up his fucking
18 degree burns and uh,

1908
01:56:54,520 --> 01:56:58,080
I came back a year later and fought again.
Do you have anything,

1909
01:56:58,081 --> 01:57:01,060
like when you go to the doctor, do you
have anything that that bothers you?

1910
01:57:01,061 --> 01:57:02,940
You still to this day from like a done,

1911
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:07,480
I know you have like a kb and your
like baby's stuck in my body but I,

1912
01:57:07,550 --> 01:57:11,520
that's by choice. I have,
uh, you know, I mean

1913
01:57:13,500 --> 01:57:16,410
like big teeth and shitty
tattoos is most of it,

1914
01:57:16,411 --> 01:57:19,600
but I'm like in my esophagus is fucked.
What's wrong,

1915
01:57:20,790 --> 01:57:24,940
what you're talking
in the car.

1916
01:57:25,050 --> 01:57:27,510
I got Barrett's esophagus.
It's like, you know,

1917
01:57:27,520 --> 01:57:31,840
like what are the warning signs for
esophageal cancer and from just like,

1918
01:57:32,040 --> 01:57:36,570
like acid reflux and I don't know,
drugs and shitty living and vomiting.

1919
01:57:37,170 --> 01:57:40,220
Do you, are you dude, take care
of yourself now? I got an idea.

1920
01:57:40,250 --> 01:57:44,700
I'm going in for an endoscopy. Cigarettes
smoked in. And you're a vegetarian now,

1921
01:57:44,701 --> 01:57:48,570
right? Yeah. Vegan. You haven't
smoked in seven years. Wow.

1922
01:57:48,600 --> 01:57:50,130
So when you start getting sober,

1923
01:57:50,810 --> 01:57:54,040
I was five months separate when
I gave up cigarettes. Oh, okay.

1924
01:57:54,041 --> 01:57:57,930
And I haven't smoked weed
and since March 9th of 2008.

1925
01:57:58,350 --> 01:58:02,730
So I'm no coffee for not
smoking weed for this one. Oh,

1926
01:58:02,731 --> 01:58:05,100
no worries man. I appreciate
it. No worries. I wouldn't,

1927
01:58:05,220 --> 01:58:07,560
wouldn't want to get you
secondhand lambasted,

1928
01:58:08,110 --> 01:58:09,960
although some people keep
telling me that's bullshit,

1929
01:58:09,961 --> 01:58:13,130
but I know it's not enough hot.
Like,

1930
01:58:13,950 --> 01:58:16,350
I don't really give a fuck
if people drink around me,

1931
01:58:16,351 --> 01:58:18,530
but like the weeks I'm like
breathing it in and like,

1932
01:58:18,540 --> 01:58:20,790
it's like the problem is it
fucking smells great man.

1933
01:58:20,791 --> 01:58:23,100
He doesn't love the smell of weed.
Smells great and it,

1934
01:58:23,130 --> 01:58:25,380
I do believe secondhand
smoke gets you hot.

1935
01:58:25,590 --> 01:58:27,720
I don't think it gets
you as high smoking pot,

1936
01:58:27,780 --> 01:58:30,180
but I think spec secondhand
smoke still affects you.

1937
01:58:30,390 --> 01:58:35,130
I don't even want to fuck with it.
Makes Sense. Super grateful. So,

1938
01:58:35,131 --> 01:58:38,560
um, oh yeah, no Vegan.

1939
01:58:39,980 --> 01:58:41,980
There's a whole

1940
01:58:42,400 --> 01:58:47,400
other fucking like a major other door

1941
01:58:50,950 --> 01:58:54,030
and there's this, I mean I'm going to
fucking let people didn't see this,

1942
01:58:54,150 --> 01:58:57,280
you know, at in Austin or at the
show time, but it's like, you know,

1943
01:58:57,300 --> 01:59:01,240
I it fucking go to rehab and
like get sober in the whole
deal and then it's like,

1944
01:59:01,241 --> 01:59:02,074
all right,
one,

1945
01:59:02,890 --> 01:59:06,040
it's great that I've learned how to
live without fucking drugs and alcohol,

1946
01:59:06,070 --> 01:59:10,210
but like now I'm going to
address my sex addiction

1947
01:59:12,030 --> 01:59:16,140
used to die that he followed her. You'll
travel with a professional cock blocker.

1948
01:59:17,330 --> 01:59:21,550
Yeah, I got, I mean, that was my deal
dude. Like, I was like, you know,

1949
01:59:21,750 --> 01:59:25,180
and this is a, it's a mean joke, I
tell, but you know, I say I'm like,

1950
01:59:25,181 --> 01:59:29,830
I'm fucking 41 now and I'm looking
at my future and you know, like,

1951
01:59:30,910 --> 01:59:34,360
I don't want to be 51 and falling apart
and trying to hump everything that moves.

1952
01:59:34,600 --> 01:59:36,190
I don't want to turn into Pauly shore.

1953
01:59:42,460 --> 01:59:47,200
I mean, if there's a guy, but, uh,
I'm sure there's a few other guys,

1954
01:59:47,710 --> 01:59:52,420
it's be fucking ride that
boat right into the rocks.

1955
01:59:57,350 --> 02:00:01,960
But the thing is, right,
right. I just like, honestly,
man, it was like, fuck dude.

1956
02:00:01,961 --> 02:00:05,000
Like I, you're married,
right? And in psych,

1957
02:00:05,570 --> 02:00:09,550
I really believe that,
like to be happy, you know,

1958
02:00:09,551 --> 02:00:12,040
like it's,
it's important to have fucking,

1959
02:00:12,041 --> 02:00:15,580
I have a life partner and knocked the
run around trying to fuck everybody and

1960
02:00:15,581 --> 02:00:18,530
screwing them over it. You know, like,
that's the deal. Like, I like, well,

1961
02:00:18,540 --> 02:00:21,940
how can I gives so much of a fuck about
animals and I won't fucking eat an

1962
02:00:21,941 --> 02:00:25,270
animal, but I have no respect
for women at all. You know,

1963
02:00:25,271 --> 02:00:28,450
like it doesn't add up like,
so it like on my fucking path.

1964
02:00:28,451 --> 02:00:30,550
And once I got into the meditation,

1965
02:00:30,551 --> 02:00:34,360
like I've been doing
transcendental meditation for
two and a half years now and

1966
02:00:34,361 --> 02:00:38,200
like, I couldn't, you know, once I got
into that, like it was just like glaring,

1967
02:00:38,201 --> 02:00:42,250
like a fucking flashing red light,
like stop fucking screwing over chicks,

1968
02:00:42,251 --> 02:00:45,580
you know? And, and fucking using him up
and throwing them away and just like,

1969
02:00:45,610 --> 02:00:47,500
you know, like, and
whatever, if I'm on the road,

1970
02:00:47,501 --> 02:00:51,070
like fuck a hooking up with
all the chicks, it's just
like, it just became clear,

1971
02:00:51,071 --> 02:00:54,440
like that's pretty much like a
path to being fucking miserable.

1972
02:00:54,450 --> 02:00:57,900
And it's a type of addiction.
Yeah, for sure. Because I get,

1973
02:00:57,901 --> 02:01:01,720
it's like anything else. So I'd like, you
know, I made myself a promise, like, okay,

1974
02:01:01,721 --> 02:01:02,680
if now on,
I'm like,

1975
02:01:02,681 --> 02:01:05,890
I want to fucking learn how to be in a
healthy relationship because I feel like

1976
02:01:05,891 --> 02:01:08,710
that's how I'm going to be happy. And so
I'm going to fucking from here on out,

1977
02:01:08,711 --> 02:01:11,830
I'm not gonna,
I'm not gonna fuck random checks on that.

1978
02:01:11,831 --> 02:01:15,970
I'm not gonna stop trying to get my
dick sucked everywhere. You know,

1979
02:01:16,480 --> 02:01:19,060
I like that. I can do it, man.

1980
02:01:19,150 --> 02:01:24,150
[inaudible] gonna Rehash and
30 days like I could do it,

1981
02:01:32,011 --> 02:01:35,940
you know, one step at a time. 12 days

1982
02:01:37,330 --> 02:01:40,040
go walk up the fucking stage.
I'm not to go anyway and type,

1983
02:01:40,041 --> 02:01:41,230
take a picture with everybody.
Right.

1984
02:01:41,420 --> 02:01:45,170
So the whole fucking audience basically
gets in align and it's an audition to

1985
02:01:45,171 --> 02:01:47,870
see who gets to suck my Dick that

1986
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:55,200
I'm,
I fucking to the whole the whole thing.

1987
02:01:55,201 --> 02:01:58,970
I mean I remember like that guy gets his
dick sucked. No, cause he's a fucking,

1988
02:01:58,971 --> 02:02:03,971
he's in the fucking sex program to program
and there's a whole program he needs

1989
02:02:05,260 --> 02:02:09,450
somebody to oversee both of you guys. I
mean, whatever. Like, I'm stoked, man,

1990
02:02:09,470 --> 02:02:11,330
because now I'm like
fucking, you know, I'm like,

1991
02:02:11,331 --> 02:02:14,870
I've gotten therapy like the whole deal
and which is hilarious because like,

1992
02:02:15,180 --> 02:02:20,090
you know, my whole story arc, you know,
it's like, it's, it's pretty epic,

1993
02:02:20,150 --> 02:02:24,910
you know, to, to go from where I was
at to where I'm at now. You know,

1994
02:02:24,950 --> 02:02:25,581
at the end,

1995
02:02:25,581 --> 02:02:28,140
I think at the end of the show I'm going
to have to fucking break out my old

1996
02:02:28,150 --> 02:02:32,170
light bulb trick and fucking slash my
shit and bleed everywhere just because,

1997
02:02:32,600 --> 02:02:33,980
just,
just,

1998
02:02:34,070 --> 02:02:38,210
just because like to
fucking try to fucking,

1999
02:02:38,211 --> 02:02:40,400
like by the end of blag my fucking show,

2000
02:02:40,401 --> 02:02:44,240
it's like a case now I'm like a
fucking Vegan and eh, you know,

2001
02:02:44,241 --> 02:02:48,740
like trying not to get my Dick's know,
like clean and sober,

2002
02:02:48,741 --> 02:02:50,570
like fucking hell. The eater, you know,

2003
02:02:50,600 --> 02:02:55,600
meditating like the least I can do is
fucking bleed all over myself out too.

2004
02:02:56,301 --> 02:03:00,410
I can do it. You're a Vegan because you
love animals. That's how I got into it.

2005
02:03:00,411 --> 02:03:02,870
Yeah,
but you feed your animals animals.

2006
02:03:03,260 --> 02:03:08,150
I do feed my dogs dog food
that has fish in it and I just,

2007
02:03:08,151 --> 02:03:11,150
I just adopted a cat and the same thing,

2008
02:03:11,880 --> 02:03:15,810
they just don't like the fuck. They just
don't fucking like Vegan dog food. I did.

2009
02:03:15,811 --> 02:03:18,570
It's terrible. I did it
for awhile. They to be,

2010
02:03:19,730 --> 02:03:21,200
they have to be like,

2011
02:03:21,680 --> 02:03:25,670
like at the point of hunger where like
you're willing to eat your own fucking

2012
02:03:25,671 --> 02:03:28,820
foot. Isn't that kind
of fucked up? You know,

2013
02:03:28,821 --> 02:03:30,620
it's like you're choosing
the animals that you love.

2014
02:03:30,621 --> 02:03:34,220
You're feeding these animals, other
animals that were captive. I mean,

2015
02:03:34,221 --> 02:03:36,560
if you want to be like super
black and white, like p,

2016
02:03:37,060 --> 02:03:42,060
then I mean that's the reality of animals,

2017
02:03:42,770 --> 02:03:47,180
right? I mean, I just like that. Like,
I dunno. I mean I hear that like the,

2018
02:03:47,181 --> 02:03:50,120
and even in my fucking canvas,
you know,

2019
02:03:50,150 --> 02:03:53,950
slip on vans that there's some kind
of animal products in the rubber

2020
02:03:55,460 --> 02:03:56,293
rubber.

2021
02:03:56,910 --> 02:04:01,410
Like I'm not gonna not get photographed
because there's animal products. The,

2022
02:04:01,450 --> 02:04:04,280
in the film, you know, you just can't,

2023
02:04:04,310 --> 02:04:07,120
you can't do everything a hundred
fucking percent. You know, like a,

2024
02:04:07,121 --> 02:04:11,230
I just do the best I can and
I feel better. I feel better
for doing it. Yeah, no,

2025
02:04:11,240 --> 02:04:12,060
it's,
it's the,

2026
02:04:12,060 --> 02:04:16,700
the animal thing is weird when people
are super self righteous about killing

2027
02:04:16,701 --> 02:04:19,300
animals. And yet that's for sure. I've,

2028
02:04:19,301 --> 02:04:22,500
I've had a real issue with that with
people cause I get it man. And that's why,

2029
02:04:23,150 --> 02:04:28,150
that's why like I'm like really fucking
committed to not try to tell other

2030
02:04:28,581 --> 02:04:33,400
people what to do. You know, I don't have
your whopper man. I don't care. Like,

2031
02:04:33,401 --> 02:04:35,240
you know what I mean? You
want, I don't give a fuck.

2032
02:04:35,270 --> 02:04:37,800
I'm just happier in myself like,
you know,

2033
02:04:37,980 --> 02:04:42,980
trying to do and why and what about like
farm fresh eggs or things along those

2034
02:04:43,141 --> 02:04:45,640
lines where nothing gets
going and I was fucking with,

2035
02:04:45,750 --> 02:04:49,020
with fish and eggs for like a while
and I want to hang around with the only

2036
02:04:49,021 --> 02:04:52,890
reason they went back to being
fully Vegan, but um, you know,

2037
02:04:52,930 --> 02:04:55,770
was cause I'm fucking tired all the
time and I'm like, man, what is it?

2038
02:04:55,771 --> 02:04:58,380
I think it's my diet and I
think if I eat fish and eggs,

2039
02:04:58,381 --> 02:05:01,050
then all of a sudden I'll have more
energy. But it didn't happen now.

2040
02:05:01,051 --> 02:05:03,990
And then I fucking had a sleep study.
It turns out I've got sleep apnea,

2041
02:05:04,050 --> 02:05:08,470
so can I do to, it was never my Jesus
c pap machine. No, I use a mouth piece.

2042
02:05:08,520 --> 02:05:11,560
I didn't see how I tried to see
pap and I can't fucking do it.

2043
02:05:11,561 --> 02:05:14,930
And so now I've got to get the mouthpiece.
I'll turn you on to a doctor that's,

2044
02:05:16,190 --> 02:05:19,920
that makes a really good one. A
lot of, um, people that have it.

2045
02:05:19,921 --> 02:05:24,921
It's your tongue for I have a fat
tongue and neck and I was not,

2046
02:05:25,340 --> 02:05:26,300
I went to this,
uh,

2047
02:05:26,740 --> 02:05:30,930
physician to get cleared
for a TV show and uh,

2048
02:05:30,960 --> 02:05:33,480
she was shining the light in
the back of my third. She said,

2049
02:05:33,481 --> 02:05:37,230
do you feel like you sleep a whole night
and wake up and you're still tired?

2050
02:05:37,231 --> 02:05:41,010
I'm like, yes. She says, what? Then the
back of your throat, it's really narrow.

2051
02:05:41,011 --> 02:05:43,590
And then she thinks, and I think
that's going to cause of sleep apnea.

2052
02:05:44,220 --> 02:05:46,500
The holes narrow. Yeah, I have that too.

2053
02:05:46,590 --> 02:05:50,010
And also like I that they've talked to
me about getting an an operation when

2054
02:05:50,011 --> 02:05:54,210
they take out your adenoids and your
tonsils and it's pretty intense and it's,

2055
02:05:54,420 --> 02:05:54,720
it's,

2056
02:05:54,720 --> 02:05:58,970
it sucks for like a week but then after
it's over you have a larger hole and

2057
02:05:58,971 --> 02:06:03,090
that larger holes better for sleeping.
But this serves me well.

2058
02:06:03,270 --> 02:06:07,790
Do you still get up to Piss as
much? Oh if I have to Piss, if I,

2059
02:06:07,800 --> 02:06:10,560
I try not to drink before I go to
bed like right before I go to bed.

2060
02:06:10,561 --> 02:06:15,561
But if I do this a lot and drink
a lot lately I've been trying,

2061
02:06:16,051 --> 02:06:20,670
I got to fucking big fucking water pitcher
next to my bed on the floor so I just

2062
02:06:20,671 --> 02:06:22,680
picked up a piss into
it and put it back down.

2063
02:06:22,681 --> 02:06:26,940
My friend Matt Serra who was former UFC
welterweight champion when I first met

2064
02:06:26,941 --> 02:06:27,330
him,

2065
02:06:27,330 --> 02:06:31,900
he had this gym in Long Island and he
used to sleep in the basement of his gym,

2066
02:06:31,920 --> 02:06:33,510
which is teach and then
go downstairs and sleep.

2067
02:06:33,870 --> 02:06:38,190
And I hear this jug right next to the bed
cause fighters will drink like gallons

2068
02:06:38,191 --> 02:06:40,980
of water. You drink water all the
time to flush your system out.

2069
02:06:40,980 --> 02:06:45,930
And he would just whip his dick out, stick
it in the hole. He healed his accent.

2070
02:06:45,931 --> 02:06:48,330
He goes, I didn't even get out
of bed. I would turn sideways,

2071
02:06:48,630 --> 02:06:52,100
put my Dick in the whole piste
pull it out, put the Jug.

2072
02:06:52,101 --> 02:06:55,980
Now went back to I did so great man.
This one was a water pitcher.

2073
02:06:56,250 --> 02:06:57,740
Like I don't have a very
big dick or anything,

2074
02:06:57,750 --> 02:07:01,080
but like I don't even really have to
like tip over man because like it's got

2075
02:07:01,081 --> 02:07:04,320
like a about things like one of
those classic Koolaid fucking

2076
02:07:06,380 --> 02:07:10,050
cool. It breaks through
the wall, the Koolaid kind.

2077
02:07:10,051 --> 02:07:14,760
So I just flip flop my deck. Good to
go. So when you got to sleep study,

2078
02:07:14,761 --> 02:07:19,010
they put all the electrodes on you times.
Did you whoa,

2079
02:07:19,020 --> 02:07:23,760
wake up in an hour. They said that it was
actually like mild to moderate, but uh,

2080
02:07:23,790 --> 02:07:25,620
but still, I mean I noticed
it dude, I'm fucking,

2081
02:07:25,621 --> 02:07:30,060
I got to get that fucking mouthpiece.
It's not, well, you should lose weight.

2082
02:07:30,120 --> 02:07:34,440
I need to do in weight as the big one I
think with Joey d is Joey Diaz uses the

2083
02:07:34,620 --> 02:07:36,160
CPAP machine,
but he

2084
02:07:36,160 --> 02:07:38,860
didn't use to have to have that.
It's like when he got really big,

2085
02:07:38,890 --> 02:07:41,740
that's when he really developed
because the more fat you have,

2086
02:07:41,741 --> 02:07:43,570
it's all closed as everything off.

2087
02:07:43,571 --> 02:07:47,050
You know when you see people with
giant jowls would guess what that fat's

2088
02:07:47,051 --> 02:07:48,580
everywhere.
It's inside your face.

2089
02:07:48,581 --> 02:07:52,540
It's inside your neck and all that fat
will close off the whole and when you lay

2090
02:07:52,541 --> 02:07:56,680
back and your tongue falls over that
whole, there's no air and just right.

2091
02:07:56,830 --> 02:07:58,780
I had to wake the guy up,
man, I was on a plane.

2092
02:07:58,781 --> 02:08:03,781
This fucking guy was not breathing for
like minutes at a time and then and then

2093
02:08:04,030 --> 02:08:06,730
gagging and coughing and that.
I'm wake them up,

2094
02:08:06,731 --> 02:08:08,890
but I talked to him when he
woke up and I said, hey man,

2095
02:08:08,891 --> 02:08:11,860
have you ever gotten checked
for sleep apnea? Because he was,

2096
02:08:11,950 --> 02:08:14,280
he was snoring the most ungodly

2097
02:08:14,630 --> 02:08:18,220
so funny man, but it wasn't like
always a snow. I'm thinking,

2098
02:08:18,221 --> 02:08:21,740
you're saying motherfucker, wake
on. I'm not snoring. He's like, oh,

2099
02:08:21,741 --> 02:08:25,300
like caring about the guy. It's like when
he said like, I'm thinking like, man,

2100
02:08:25,301 --> 02:08:26,170
I'm going to get sued.

2101
02:08:26,171 --> 02:08:28,840
Like you're not worried about the
kid who's got spiked on his head.

2102
02:08:29,230 --> 02:08:34,010
You're a good guy. I try to be, it

2103
02:08:34,020 --> 02:08:36,780
was freaking me out because
he was making these noises

2104
02:08:42,030 --> 02:08:46,350
and then he would go back to like,
and then it would be nothing,

2105
02:08:46,380 --> 02:08:48,250
no sound. And uh, I'm,

2106
02:08:48,280 --> 02:08:52,710
I'm awake because I was writing and it
was on a long flight and I looked over at

2107
02:08:52,711 --> 02:08:54,500
this guy and I'm noticing that he's,

2108
02:08:54,510 --> 02:08:59,190
he's very overweight and it's just
lying there. Like there's no movement,

2109
02:08:59,340 --> 02:09:02,430
no breathing, no, no movement at
all in his chest. Then all of sudden

2110
02:09:04,580 --> 02:09:07,410
like, I mean, he would go, I mean
I'm exaggerating when I say minutes,

2111
02:09:07,411 --> 02:09:10,830
but he would definitely go 40 seconds.
Like I timed it,

2112
02:09:10,831 --> 02:09:11,730
I forget what the time was,

2113
02:09:11,731 --> 02:09:14,910
but I remember being alarmed and
I remember sitting up going, okay,

2114
02:09:14,970 --> 02:09:16,020
I got to talk to this guy.

2115
02:09:16,260 --> 02:09:19,680
And I had my mouthpiece with me
cause I bring it in my bad moods.

2116
02:09:19,681 --> 02:09:22,230
Your lower jaw forward. Oh,
no, no, no. Mine doesn't.

2117
02:09:22,231 --> 02:09:27,231
Mine actually just depresses my tongue
down and it keeps my tongue from falling

2118
02:09:27,361 --> 02:09:29,790
back over my air hole problem.

2119
02:09:29,791 --> 02:09:34,200
It depends on what kind of sleep apnea
as that central one. I think they said.

2120
02:09:34,380 --> 02:09:37,140
Hmm. I don't know what's the
difference? I don't know.

2121
02:09:37,200 --> 02:09:39,660
Joey would know more than anyone
because Joey's got it real bad.

2122
02:09:39,661 --> 02:09:44,490
Joey needs the CPAP, like he has to have
air blow in this whole, I love that.

2123
02:09:44,910 --> 02:09:49,110
I love him too. It's probably smoking weed
right now in Paris. Go back. Um, but uh,

2124
02:09:49,140 --> 02:09:50,030
anyway,
so I,

2125
02:09:50,370 --> 02:09:54,810
the guy was like kind of stirring and
moving and when he finally was like

2126
02:09:55,020 --> 02:09:56,490
opening his eyes and looking around,

2127
02:09:56,491 --> 02:09:59,330
I talked to him and I had like
a long sit down with them.

2128
02:09:59,350 --> 02:10:02,580
I showed them the mouthpiece, I'm going
to go, dude, you could die. I go, you,

2129
02:10:02,581 --> 02:10:04,260
you hold your,
I was going to film it,

2130
02:10:04,261 --> 02:10:07,410
but I thought there would be rude
to just film you. But I mean,

2131
02:10:07,411 --> 02:10:09,390
you're holding your
breath for a long time.

2132
02:10:09,391 --> 02:10:11,880
If you ever talked to anyone
about it. He's like, no, you know,

2133
02:10:11,881 --> 02:10:14,070
my wife tells me I snore. I
go, dude, you don't just snore.

2134
02:10:14,071 --> 02:10:16,140
You like choking to death.
You know?

2135
02:10:16,141 --> 02:10:18,270
And there's a lot of people that you
don't know what happens when you go to

2136
02:10:18,271 --> 02:10:21,990
sleep. You're out and you sleep, you're
out. And when you're out like that,

2137
02:10:21,991 --> 02:10:25,260
you're not getting any oxygen. When you
sleep, you don't get into heavy rem sleep.

2138
02:10:25,440 --> 02:10:27,120
You're going to get
into those deep cycles.

2139
02:10:27,121 --> 02:10:30,510
You just skirt the edges and then you
wake up because your body's gasping and

2140
02:10:30,511 --> 02:10:31,344
panic mode.

2141
02:10:31,440 --> 02:10:35,240
And so you'll wake up after like eight
of sleep and he's still fucking exhausted

2142
02:10:35,620 --> 02:10:38,570
every day. I feel like I could go
back to bed or right when I wake up.

2143
02:10:39,380 --> 02:10:42,050
You really could, should lose weight.
I mean, you know, that's a big,

2144
02:10:42,100 --> 02:10:46,070
that's its social Joey. Joey mean this
is a big thing with Joey's way, way,

2145
02:10:46,071 --> 02:10:50,180
way overweight. Yeah. And he got down
a while just like you did. I mean,

2146
02:10:50,181 --> 02:10:53,960
Joey lost like 80 fucking pounds
at one point. But um, he's,

2147
02:10:54,140 --> 02:10:57,470
he gets energy from that c-pap.
Like he feels way better.

2148
02:10:57,471 --> 02:11:01,100
Like he travels with one.
He has this machine that he travels with,

2149
02:11:01,220 --> 02:11:02,720
then he has to check.
I mean,

2150
02:11:02,721 --> 02:11:06,890
so he always has to check his
luggage because his carry on his,

2151
02:11:06,891 --> 02:11:10,700
his c pap machine. So he doesn't go
anywhere without checking his luggage.

2152
02:11:10,701 --> 02:11:14,180
Every flight he takes joy. He brings that
machine with him. That is his fucking,

2153
02:11:14,240 --> 02:11:16,970
that's his security system.
You brought up earlier,

2154
02:11:16,971 --> 02:11:21,020
you brought up Greg Fitzsimmons because
Cosby thing. What do you think about it?

2155
02:11:21,021 --> 02:11:25,940
Cause I, I it makes me feel weird. I don't
like it. It's misguided. I Love Greg,

2156
02:11:25,970 --> 02:11:29,510
but I think it's misguided for folks who
don't know what we're talking about. Uh,

2157
02:11:29,540 --> 02:11:33,680
Greg is decided to start stealing
bill Cosby's material and uh,

2158
02:11:33,681 --> 02:11:34,730
doing it openly.

2159
02:11:34,880 --> 02:11:39,880
So he does these classic Bill Cosby bits
and then he lets everybody know in the

2160
02:11:40,371 --> 02:11:44,570
middle of it that he's stealing bill
Cosby's bits to take away from him what is

2161
02:11:44,571 --> 02:11:47,840
most precious. But it doesn't
really work because it doesn't,

2162
02:11:47,841 --> 02:11:51,350
you don't like if someone tries to
steal some shit off of like shiny,

2163
02:11:51,351 --> 02:11:54,860
happy Jihad or something like that, like
it's already out. It's already on CD.

2164
02:11:54,890 --> 02:11:58,910
I did it and you know,
fucking 2006 like if you're stealing,

2165
02:11:59,180 --> 02:12:02,600
you're not taking anything away from
me, you're just, you're just, you know,

2166
02:12:02,601 --> 02:12:04,640
you're just selling
yourself short by stealing.

2167
02:12:04,980 --> 02:12:09,920
So like if Greg does bill
Cosby's material, you don't
ever take it away from him.

2168
02:12:09,950 --> 02:12:13,760
It's already recorded. These are like,
he doesn't even do that material anymore.

2169
02:12:13,761 --> 02:12:16,220
So I don't know. I don't think
it's really, it's active.

2170
02:12:16,280 --> 02:12:20,510
It seems like you're taking something
negative and being negative about it.

2171
02:12:20,511 --> 02:12:25,190
It just doesn't seem it. And I also think
it just opens the door to people go,

2172
02:12:25,191 --> 02:12:28,550
well Greg stolen bill Cosby's
jokes, you know, and Ah,

2173
02:12:28,580 --> 02:12:30,860
but he says it on stage that stealing it.

2174
02:12:30,890 --> 02:12:34,010
He lets people know in the middle of
it that he's stealing bill Cosby's.

2175
02:12:34,190 --> 02:12:37,610
Greg Fitzsimmons steals bill
Cosby's bits now he does.

2176
02:12:37,611 --> 02:12:40,730
He's doing it on purpose to try
to take something from bill Cosby.

2177
02:12:40,731 --> 02:12:42,590
Like this is the idea behind it.
I think

2178
02:12:42,840 --> 02:12:47,540
it sounds like Dell ocozzio it'd be super
psyched on that because it's like, wow,

2179
02:12:47,541 --> 02:12:50,650
I'm getting credit for being funny
and it's distracting people from,

2180
02:12:54,320 --> 02:12:58,030
there's actually something totally
bill Cosby. Thanks. Totally true.

2181
02:12:58,070 --> 02:12:59,390
That's completely defeating.

2182
02:12:59,580 --> 02:13:02,730
Yeah, I think it's a gimmick. I
mean, I, I see what he's like.

2183
02:13:02,731 --> 02:13:05,830
He's just genuinely thinks
the guy's disgusting. Right?

2184
02:13:06,730 --> 02:13:10,670
Jan [inaudible] glorify it.
His comedy by,

2185
02:13:11,210 --> 02:13:15,440
Yeah. I mean, I don't get it either.
I don't know. I just, I don't know.

2186
02:13:15,500 --> 02:13:19,160
Maybe if I had them on and Greg, oh, have
monsoon and he's going to be on soon.

2187
02:13:19,190 --> 02:13:22,370
I guess we're talking about doing
something with the next couple of weeks,

2188
02:13:22,730 --> 02:13:25,310
so maybe he'll explain it better.
I just,

2189
02:13:25,970 --> 02:13:28,680
I wouldn't want to have anything
to do with it. You know,

2190
02:13:29,550 --> 02:13:30,470
there's some fascinating,

2191
02:13:30,471 --> 02:13:34,590
there's some lady that was on who was a
legal expert who was discussing it and

2192
02:13:34,591 --> 02:13:38,400
she said he might be the most
prolific serial rapist in history,

2193
02:13:39,090 --> 02:13:43,830
which is fucking insane. It's insane
to look at it that way. This guy,

2194
02:13:44,100 --> 02:13:48,360
Mr Huxtable,
you know the fucking guy from the TV show,

2195
02:13:48,361 --> 02:13:53,180
the guy who had the squeaky clean comedy,
the guy who did the bit about, you know,

2196
02:13:53,190 --> 02:13:56,250
the football players saying
hi mom to his son on TV.

2197
02:13:56,251 --> 02:13:59,430
This guy who was like wholesome
Mister America in a sweater.

2198
02:14:00,080 --> 02:14:04,760
But none of these girls like
the next morning, well guide,
what the fuck happened?

2199
02:14:04,820 --> 02:14:08,900
He raped me, I am going to do the
police and this is all you know,

2200
02:14:09,060 --> 02:14:10,640
kind of like wishy washy.

2201
02:14:10,641 --> 02:14:14,780
Like yeah I kind of felt weird that
night but no one really went right to the

2202
02:14:14,781 --> 02:14:15,830
police though.
Did they?

2203
02:14:16,170 --> 02:14:18,540
Um, I don't know. I don't
know. It seems weird.

2204
02:14:18,541 --> 02:14:21,900
It just seems like to me it seems
like a lot of people just kind of,

2205
02:14:22,260 --> 02:14:25,260
I don't know. Well listen man, if you
were a girl, okay look at it this way.

2206
02:14:25,261 --> 02:14:28,980
You're some young girl who's trying to
make it in show business and you're,

2207
02:14:28,981 --> 02:14:33,870
you know, you get brought into his
office because you know his, you know,

2208
02:14:33,871 --> 02:14:37,200
he knows your parents or something like
that. That was a lot of the situation.

2209
02:14:37,201 --> 02:14:37,921
Like he,

2210
02:14:37,921 --> 02:14:42,921
there was one of one situation was
there was like a modeling company and he

2211
02:14:43,291 --> 02:14:46,380
would contact the mall and
company to get people on his show.

2212
02:14:46,381 --> 02:14:50,700
Like you're looking to cast roles that
didn't even exist and he'd have them in

2213
02:14:50,701 --> 02:14:53,640
his office and drug them and fuck on cass.

2214
02:14:55,020 --> 02:14:57,690
He would bring them into his
office and drug them like,

2215
02:14:57,691 --> 02:15:00,840
would you like a Cappuccino? What'd
you learn to do the carpet? You know,

2216
02:15:01,080 --> 02:15:04,770
and give them a Cappuccino and fuck them.
I mean, just drug them. I don't know

2217
02:15:05,470 --> 02:15:08,050
where to happen though. Like four
hours later, this girl's like,

2218
02:15:08,110 --> 02:15:11,320
I just went there for an interview,
had a Cappuccino and he fucked me.

2219
02:15:11,380 --> 02:15:12,213
Like you'd go, right? Yeah.

2220
02:15:12,840 --> 02:15:14,370
This is why. This is why. No,

2221
02:15:14,400 --> 02:15:16,890
because I think for what I was
going to say is like these,

2222
02:15:16,950 --> 02:15:20,850
these are young girls that are probably
completely overwhelmed that they're even

2223
02:15:20,851 --> 02:15:25,230
in his presence. Like they can't even
believe that they're meaning bill Cosby.

2224
02:15:25,231 --> 02:15:29,340
So you're insanely starstruck and the
fact that he's touching you puts you into

2225
02:15:29,341 --> 02:15:30,330
a state of shock.

2226
02:15:30,331 --> 02:15:33,980
Like you're fucked up and then you're
confused because you wake up and you're,

2227
02:15:33,981 --> 02:15:34,980
you were drugged.

2228
02:15:34,981 --> 02:15:39,300
You don't know what happened and then
you're embarrassed and horrified of it.

2229
02:15:39,330 --> 02:15:43,710
I mean, there's so many Mr Huxtable.

2230
02:15:43,770 --> 02:15:48,300
Exactly. It's like he's, this is
before the Internet, man. You know,

2231
02:15:48,301 --> 02:15:50,230
if a girl like that,
if that happened today,

2232
02:15:50,240 --> 02:15:52,110
a girl go on our Facebook page and say,

2233
02:15:52,111 --> 02:15:56,880
today I went on an audition with bill
Cosby and he drug me and rape me.

2234
02:15:57,090 --> 02:16:01,830
And like, Whoa, like Bam, that takes off
and it goes viral. But back then, man,

2235
02:16:01,831 --> 02:16:03,120
if you go to the fucking police,

2236
02:16:03,121 --> 02:16:07,230
they might not say shit or they might
go to cosmic cosmic might sue you.

2237
02:16:07,350 --> 02:16:09,150
But you've got to realize some women did.

2238
02:16:09,270 --> 02:16:13,230
And in 2005 he actually
paid off women and he,

2239
02:16:13,231 --> 02:16:18,231
that's why this all got more serious
lately is because they released the

2240
02:16:18,331 --> 02:16:23,331
transcripts and the transcripts said
that he admitted that he had drug these

2241
02:16:23,671 --> 02:16:26,550
girls, he admitted it. So this,

2242
02:16:26,551 --> 02:16:31,330
this did go to cops and it
didn't go out to the public.

2243
02:16:31,540 --> 02:16:36,250
So it's like, it's not kinda weird,
it's just the amount of power and money.

2244
02:16:36,251 --> 02:16:39,190
This guy bill Cosby, he's
like a billionaire. I mean,

2245
02:16:39,191 --> 02:16:41,590
the amount of money
that guy has is insane.

2246
02:16:41,710 --> 02:16:45,490
And the amount of power that kind of
money has where you're talking about just

2247
02:16:45,491 --> 02:16:50,170
teams of lawyers that just try to figure
out any sort of attack that they could

2248
02:16:50,171 --> 02:16:54,700
do to try to mitigate any of the issues
that are going on with people accusing

2249
02:16:54,701 --> 02:16:57,460
him of all this crazy,
you know, rape shit.

2250
02:16:57,730 --> 02:17:02,230
It's like he, he, he
fought it for a long time.

2251
02:17:02,520 --> 02:17:06,490
He hasn't really publicly denied any
of it. No, he hasn't denied it at all.

2252
02:17:06,940 --> 02:17:09,400
He hasn't denied it all. He just
doesn't talk about it. You know,

2253
02:17:10,030 --> 02:17:14,020
one of the weirdest things that he said,
he did this one interview and he said,

2254
02:17:14,470 --> 02:17:17,320
in all my years of show business,

2255
02:17:17,321 --> 02:17:20,380
I've never seen anything like this.
Yeah,

2256
02:17:20,381 --> 02:17:23,770
well that's called free speech.
This is what's going on now.

2257
02:17:24,020 --> 02:17:25,990
[inaudible] everyone can talk now.

2258
02:17:26,170 --> 02:17:31,170
Like now people can get online and
talk about crimes that you committed.

2259
02:17:32,680 --> 02:17:37,270
It's like you can't hide behind lawyers
anymore. You can't threaten them.

2260
02:17:37,450 --> 02:17:41,620
You know, you can't, you and your girl
and you're barely paying your bills.

2261
02:17:41,860 --> 02:17:42,370
You know,

2262
02:17:42,370 --> 02:17:47,200
you're barely getting by and he offers
you $20,000 or $100,000 to shut the fuck

2263
02:17:47,201 --> 02:17:50,230
up and you have to sign
some written agreement.

2264
02:17:50,380 --> 02:17:52,900
It says you never speak about this again.
You take that money.

2265
02:17:53,260 --> 02:17:54,093
That's what they do.

2266
02:17:54,190 --> 02:17:56,690
And that's what they did in 2005 and
I don't know how much they got paid.

2267
02:17:56,730 --> 02:17:59,440
It's probably even more than that.
Probably a million. I mean, when you,

2268
02:17:59,490 --> 02:18:02,940
when you're worth what that
guy's made in his career, I mean,

2269
02:18:02,941 --> 02:18:07,690
who knows what he's got left. But when
someone 100,000 here, 100,000 there,

2270
02:18:07,691 --> 02:18:10,900
for a guy like that, there's nothing.
He could silence a lot of shit.

2271
02:18:11,230 --> 02:18:14,320
But just keeping people quiet with money,
you know?

2272
02:18:14,321 --> 02:18:18,010
And that's probably what happened when
things came up. I mean, I don't know.

2273
02:18:18,430 --> 02:18:22,350
And then there's also people feet with
fear of being blackballed, you know,

2274
02:18:22,390 --> 02:18:25,690
being blackballed from show business when
you're a struggling actress and you're

2275
02:18:25,691 --> 02:18:26,471
barely getting by.

2276
02:18:26,471 --> 02:18:31,240
The difference between bill Cosby talking
badly about you and accusing you of

2277
02:18:31,241 --> 02:18:34,750
being a liar. Like, who's going to listen
to you and who's going to listen to him?

2278
02:18:35,080 --> 02:18:38,200
They got to think that most people are
going to listen to bill Cosby and that

2279
02:18:38,201 --> 02:18:42,370
could wreck your career before it ever
gets started. Just sink your ship.

2280
02:18:42,760 --> 02:18:45,550
And it seems like a lot of
these girls that he preyed on,

2281
02:18:45,700 --> 02:18:47,470
we're trying to make it in show business.

2282
02:18:47,471 --> 02:18:50,050
There was a big part of
like what he would attack.

2283
02:18:50,051 --> 02:18:54,070
He would go after these girls that were
trying to become actresses and he was

2284
02:18:54,280 --> 02:18:57,760
like a mentor figure. That was like
the angle that he was presenting.

2285
02:18:58,400 --> 02:19:01,930
It's dark shit man.
How'd we get on that?

2286
02:19:02,690 --> 02:19:07,630
I take one pice. Oh, we're
talking about Greg Fitzsimmons,

2287
02:19:08,020 --> 02:19:12,330
Greg Fitzsimmons in his bill Cosby a
strategy. I just, yeah, I don't know.

2288
02:19:12,580 --> 02:19:16,180
It's a little misguided I think. I Dunno.
Maybe. Maybe Greg's got a better point.

2289
02:19:16,181 --> 02:19:18,070
Maybe we need to let him articulate it.

2290
02:19:19,630 --> 02:19:24,130
It's the darkest thing in
all of the history of standup
comedy, I think. I mean,

2291
02:19:24,131 --> 02:19:27,030
or, or close to it, you know?
I mean, what else there,

2292
02:19:27,140 --> 02:19:30,650
that Vince Champ guy that was raping
college girls and he got caught,

2293
02:19:30,890 --> 02:19:32,720
he would say horrible shit to them.

2294
02:19:32,721 --> 02:19:35,180
Like pray for me and stuff
like while he's fucking them.

2295
02:19:35,460 --> 02:19:37,220
Well that guy's in jail
for the rest of his life.

2296
02:19:37,580 --> 02:19:39,380
Cosby's just out running around.
I mean,

2297
02:19:39,381 --> 02:19:42,800
it doesn't seem like there's any charges
that are being put up against him.

2298
02:19:42,950 --> 02:19:43,671
And as far as I know,

2299
02:19:43,671 --> 02:19:48,671
there's only one woman that the rape
happened inside the statue of limitations.

2300
02:19:49,190 --> 02:19:50,960
I don't know what the
statute of limitations is,

2301
02:19:50,961 --> 02:19:55,250
but I think it's like six or seven.
That's it. That seems fucked.

2302
02:19:55,310 --> 02:19:58,310
I think it's rape. I think it's seven
years. But that's kind of like whoa.

2303
02:19:58,430 --> 02:20:00,980
You know, it's a little wishy
washy. Meaning like if you've,

2304
02:20:01,040 --> 02:20:03,650
if you've raped somebody and you
have great proof eight years later,

2305
02:20:03,651 --> 02:20:07,100
I'm sure there's still going now. I don't
know. I don't think that's the case.

2306
02:20:07,101 --> 02:20:10,780
I think a statute of limitations is
pretty rock solid. Like once it, yeah,

2307
02:20:11,120 --> 02:20:15,620
like double jeopardy and shit. Yeah,
it's not, it's law, you know? I Dunno.

2308
02:20:15,770 --> 02:20:18,980
It's fucked up. We've talked
about that so many times. It's a,

2309
02:20:18,981 --> 02:20:20,870
it's a subject has been beaten to death,

2310
02:20:20,871 --> 02:20:25,040
but if it seems like it's so significant
that you kind of have to beat it to

2311
02:20:25,041 --> 02:20:27,680
death cause it's hard to believe.

2312
02:20:27,920 --> 02:20:30,950
Imagine if that was like your dad or
something like that. Imagine, you know,

2313
02:20:31,010 --> 02:20:34,190
if you found out your dad was a
fucking serial rapist or your mom,

2314
02:20:34,191 --> 02:20:37,780
even your mom's drug and dude
suck in their dicks taking it

2315
02:20:37,830 --> 02:20:38,663
their shoes

2316
02:20:41,000 --> 02:20:46,000
as size side do about if your
son came up from school and told,

2317
02:20:46,680 --> 02:20:50,850
told you that his teachers sucked
his Dick, I piss you would be,

2318
02:20:52,140 --> 02:20:56,550
don't you ever ruin that?
Knows that he called the cops.

2319
02:20:57,140 --> 02:21:01,490
It was called the police
because a teacher is like,

2320
02:21:01,550 --> 02:21:04,890
how does someone ever find out
that a female teacher, Melissa Kid,

2321
02:21:05,040 --> 02:21:08,250
one of those policies as an open
his mouth? Like where was his dad?

2322
02:21:11,490 --> 02:21:16,140
My son did that out. I wouldn't be
pissed to believe, dude, you're fine.

2323
02:21:17,050 --> 02:21:19,860
Okay. It's just, there's
a giant difference.

2324
02:21:19,900 --> 02:21:24,140
Chino woman molesting a boy and a
man molesting a girl. I mean, I,

2325
02:21:24,141 --> 02:21:27,360
I don't think it should be encouraged,
but it's certainly not the same.

2326
02:21:28,610 --> 02:21:33,110
Did you hear about anonymous? A releasing
all the KKK members information?

2327
02:21:33,320 --> 02:21:36,380
Supposedly there's a lot of
us senators got released.

2328
02:21:37,370 --> 02:21:40,070
I applaud you anonymous.
I feel like anonymous

2329
02:21:40,150 --> 02:21:45,100
overall across the board does more
good shit. I don't, I hear very,

2330
02:21:45,101 --> 02:21:49,690
very few bad accusations on their part.
Almost everything they do.

2331
02:21:49,691 --> 02:21:53,560
I agree with. I love it.
Like it. Good fuck the KKK.

2332
02:21:53,890 --> 02:21:58,890
Fuck all those crazy fucking stone age
assholes who give a shit about the origin

2333
02:21:58,991 --> 02:22:01,570
of birth of your great, great,
great grandparents. You know,

2334
02:22:01,571 --> 02:22:05,050
you're not Peul not
off the pool of rights.

2335
02:22:06,250 --> 02:22:07,210
It's going to be interesting though,

2336
02:22:07,211 --> 02:22:11,710
cause supposedly there's some Ferguson
police that are involved in this side and

2337
02:22:11,740 --> 02:22:13,360
it, the whole list, uh,

2338
02:22:13,400 --> 02:22:15,830
officially gets released and I
think next week or this week,

2339
02:22:16,290 --> 02:22:21,140
meanwhile, Brian's on it. Well,

2340
02:22:21,141 --> 02:22:23,930
they could just put your name on it,
man. If somebody wanted to fuck with you,

2341
02:22:23,960 --> 02:22:25,650
Steve o's in the KKK.
What?

2342
02:22:28,680 --> 02:22:32,760
Yeah, you, you've, you've kind of
morphed. It's really fascinating.

2343
02:22:33,060 --> 02:22:36,120
I mean seeing you go from being this wild,

2344
02:22:36,121 --> 02:22:40,470
crazy ketamine,
Norton psychopath,

2345
02:22:40,471 --> 02:22:45,140
jumping off roofs and shit and damaging
your body to be in this Vegan who's

2346
02:22:45,150 --> 02:22:49,450
trying to live a kind life and trying to
be nice to people and you don't want to

2347
02:22:50,280 --> 02:22:54,590
randomly hook up with girls cause you
want to have a meaningful relationship and

2348
02:22:54,840 --> 02:22:57,710
taking care of animals and fuck seaworld.

2349
02:22:57,720 --> 02:23:01,470
It's really amazing to
see you, uh, become this.

2350
02:23:01,710 --> 02:23:02,820
Yeah. You know, I mean,

2351
02:23:03,090 --> 02:23:06,270
every once in a while I
got to do something pretty
fucked up just to make sure

2352
02:23:06,271 --> 02:23:10,170
that I'm, I'm not a pussy. Well,

2353
02:23:10,171 --> 02:23:14,790
I didn't meet you until you were sober.
Right. You know, I missed the crazy train.

2354
02:23:16,470 --> 02:23:21,300
I've kept it pretty crazy
sober too though. Yeah. Oh
No, no doubt. Yeah. I mean,

2355
02:23:21,301 --> 02:23:25,230
just explaining what you're planning on
doing it the paramount before they found

2356
02:23:25,231 --> 02:23:29,040
out about it. Do you think
there's going to be a jackass,

2357
02:23:29,100 --> 02:23:32,660
jackass four k or something
like that, ma'am. But, um,

2358
02:23:32,720 --> 02:23:37,410
everyone was getting old and her fucking
injury last one was so great work and

2359
02:23:37,440 --> 02:23:40,920
I'm working my dick opt to get
my own movie. Oh yeah, yeah.

2360
02:23:41,250 --> 02:23:44,850
Like a sort of,
sort of like the bad grandpa format.

2361
02:23:44,851 --> 02:23:48,720
But I was bad grandpa. Good.
Oh yeah. That was a funny,

2362
02:23:48,721 --> 02:23:53,340
funny fucking mood. I cried when he
got his dick stuck in that machine.

2363
02:23:54,060 --> 02:23:55,710
Oh my God.
It was one of the funny,

2364
02:23:55,730 --> 02:23:58,350
and that was a funny fucking
movie that I was really good.

2365
02:23:58,440 --> 02:23:59,640
I don't think dot enough credit.

2366
02:24:00,120 --> 02:24:03,900
I really don't think it got as much credit
as it deserved. I think it did well.

2367
02:24:03,901 --> 02:24:07,860
I was never one, but it's one of the
funniest movies I've ever seen in my life.

2368
02:24:07,980 --> 02:24:10,320
And when you talk about
like funny all time movies,

2369
02:24:10,321 --> 02:24:13,650
very few people bring up bad grandpa.
I think they should.

2370
02:24:13,920 --> 02:24:18,090
I think it's a God damn epic movie
Kid shitting on the wall and when he's

2371
02:24:18,091 --> 02:24:21,230
dancing and dancing that kids awesome.
I love the kid in there when,

2372
02:24:21,231 --> 02:24:24,030
when he goes to the, the
black club and he's, uh,

2373
02:24:24,300 --> 02:24:28,290
w with all the ladies and he's
dancing. Come on. Fuck. Yeah, Dude.

2374
02:24:28,320 --> 02:24:30,480
It's fucking epic moving.
Yeah.

2375
02:24:30,510 --> 02:24:34,280
So do you have a movie of it worked out
or do you have an idea? Yeah, I, I'm,

2376
02:24:34,300 --> 02:24:39,270
I'm gonna, I'm gonna like keep the cards
close to your chest. I did, but um,

2377
02:24:39,520 --> 02:24:43,620
I, but I got to deal with that. You
got a big time movie producer guys.

2378
02:24:45,060 --> 02:24:45,490
Yeah.

2379
02:24:45,490 --> 02:24:49,950
So Noward and like God and taking it
and like getting it written and get the

2380
02:24:49,951 --> 02:24:52,980
director and then take it to
the studio is kind of a deal.

2381
02:24:53,070 --> 02:24:56,730
So we were talking about this, the
damage that it's done early, the fuck on,

2382
02:24:56,731 --> 02:25:00,000
but we were talking about the damage
you've done to your body before you went

2383
02:25:00,001 --> 02:25:03,380
off to pee. And you said
Esophagus. Esophagus.

2384
02:25:03,670 --> 02:25:07,170
Barrett's Barrett's esophagus. I
had, but that's it. Other than that,

2385
02:25:07,171 --> 02:25:12,000
like pretty much hands and joints and back
and joints are all good. That's crazy.

2386
02:25:12,180 --> 02:25:14,790
What about Knoxville's? He, okay. He's

2387
02:25:16,390 --> 02:25:20,980
gotten some back issues. I think
it's tough from that bowl. I,

2388
02:25:21,000 --> 02:25:24,280
which bull bull you,
he went blind fold

2389
02:25:24,280 --> 02:25:24,670
and the

2390
02:25:24,670 --> 02:25:28,750
right now as I bought was a
Yak, but oh, that was a dad.

2391
02:25:28,840 --> 02:25:31,660
I don't think that he got particular
herd on that. I think that one thing,

2392
02:25:32,470 --> 02:25:37,240
one thing that, uh, did a lot of
damage to him was early, early on,

2393
02:25:37,640 --> 02:25:41,080
uh,
dropping in on the skateboard half pipe,

2394
02:25:41,400 --> 02:25:44,110
one of the big vert ramps and just like,

2395
02:25:44,890 --> 02:25:47,200
I mean just fell straight
to the flat bottom.

2396
02:25:47,201 --> 02:25:50,340
And like I remember like
hearing that like, you know,

2397
02:25:50,590 --> 02:25:53,850
if he turns his like
turning the car like hurts,

2398
02:25:54,240 --> 02:25:56,280
you know how to host
his shoulder's fucked.

2399
02:25:56,430 --> 02:25:59,140
Definitely did more
damage because like he,

2400
02:25:59,150 --> 02:26:02,680
he didn't have like the benefit of
growing up like falling off a skateboard,

2401
02:26:02,681 --> 02:26:04,930
sort of learning how to fall down.
They get out of like,

2402
02:26:05,210 --> 02:26:09,700
when he like got a lot of
us are like Sorta, you know,

2403
02:26:10,420 --> 02:26:11,410
I mean I'm like,
you know,

2404
02:26:11,740 --> 02:26:16,300
sort of circus clown acrobat
lifelong fuck by trade.

2405
02:26:16,301 --> 02:26:20,140
So yeah. So yeah. So I'm
kind of more like, like a,

2406
02:26:20,141 --> 02:26:24,190
I'm better at falling down to
that getting hurt. My falls down.

2407
02:26:24,191 --> 02:26:27,040
It just me hitting the ground in the
worst way, which is why it's shit.

2408
02:26:27,050 --> 02:26:28,390
It's always the best,
you know.

2409
02:26:28,500 --> 02:26:32,340
Oh yeah, that makes sense. Cause you
can do flips and all that shit. Right.

2410
02:26:32,341 --> 02:26:34,300
You fall with your body.

2411
02:26:34,410 --> 02:26:38,490
Yeah. And I'm, I'm more like a cat when
it gets down to it and Knoxville is just,

2412
02:26:39,090 --> 02:26:42,630
you know, say I think that he's,
he's probably in worse shape,

2413
02:26:42,631 --> 02:26:47,280
but then again the same time I
think that, uh, you know, had he,

2414
02:26:47,590 --> 02:26:50,460
it takes good care of him sobbing,
you know,

2415
02:26:51,000 --> 02:26:55,080
and I think maybe he's done some mending
or get some disc issues. I don't know.

2416
02:26:56,380 --> 02:26:59,380
Yeah, I've had a gang
of those. I did, um, uh,

2417
02:26:59,381 --> 02:27:02,920
my own stunts for this accidentally did
my own stunts for this Kevin James Movie.

2418
02:27:02,921 --> 02:27:06,010
I was in it because I suck at
riding bikes. I had a ride,

2419
02:27:06,011 --> 02:27:08,860
a bike and I had hit him with a flag.
Which Kevin James Movie.

2420
02:27:08,861 --> 02:27:10,740
It was a zookeeper and I was

2421
02:27:11,400 --> 02:27:15,030
guy that I'm telling you about is
the one I did that movie. Which guy?

2422
02:27:15,060 --> 02:27:15,900
Todd Garner.

2423
02:27:16,230 --> 02:27:20,610
Oh, the guy who the produce. I know
Todd. He's a good dude. I love Todd. Um,

2424
02:27:21,060 --> 02:27:23,550
so I,
I had to hit the break walls.

2425
02:27:23,580 --> 02:27:25,920
I was like riding a bike and I
was hitting him with his flag,

2426
02:27:26,130 --> 02:27:29,310
but I'm hitting the front brake. And when
you, you know, you hit the front brake,

2427
02:27:29,311 --> 02:27:33,690
if it locks, you go flying over the top.
And I did it like three times the skin.

2428
02:27:34,020 --> 02:27:37,590
We wind up using that in the movie instead
of the stunt man because I just want

2429
02:27:37,591 --> 02:27:41,070
to go fucking flying.
But I'm pretty good at following.

2430
02:27:41,100 --> 02:27:44,710
It was a lifelong martial
artists. So all the, like the,

2431
02:27:44,880 --> 02:27:48,060
I knew when I hit the ground that
you can't just hit the ground.

2432
02:27:48,061 --> 02:27:52,020
You got to kind of like roll with
it. Sure. But, uh, you really have a,

2433
02:27:52,021 --> 02:27:55,650
a real strong appreciation for stunt
people when you do something like that.

2434
02:27:55,860 --> 02:27:58,950
Because I go, well, I got through
this, luckily without getting hurt,

2435
02:27:59,160 --> 02:28:02,970
but if I had to do this every
fucking day or every week,

2436
02:28:03,030 --> 02:28:07,110
some new thing where you fallen off of
a building or jumping off of a fucking

2437
02:28:07,260 --> 02:28:11,310
moving car, I did potential for
damaging yourself as super high.

2438
02:28:11,580 --> 02:28:13,080
Or you hear about those people dying.

2439
02:28:13,320 --> 02:28:17,250
It's always like some movie that no one's
going to give a fuck about some racing

2440
02:28:17,251 --> 02:28:20,850
motorcycle scene, a Steven Seagal movie
and someone dies. You know, I mean,

2441
02:28:21,050 --> 02:28:24,710
you gotta when you watch those crazy
action movies, think about that.

2442
02:28:24,711 --> 02:28:26,510
Appreciate the fact that those people,

2443
02:28:26,780 --> 02:28:30,410
they literally put their physical health
and their life on the line for your

2444
02:28:30,411 --> 02:28:31,670
entertainment.
You know,

2445
02:28:31,671 --> 02:28:36,650
I didn't think about it too much until
I just fucked up and fell a few times on

2446
02:28:36,651 --> 02:28:38,750
a bike in a movie.
You know,

2447
02:28:38,780 --> 02:28:41,960
it's like those guys do it
on purpose all the time.

2448
02:28:42,490 --> 02:28:46,570
Yeah, that's right, man.
It's fucking hard Gig, man.

2449
02:28:47,200 --> 02:28:50,370
That's a hard drive.
Said the fucking paramount.

2450
02:28:52,790 --> 02:28:57,790
See this now? I want to be,
there you go. Why don't you
