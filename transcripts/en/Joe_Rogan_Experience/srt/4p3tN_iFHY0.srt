1
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:02,061
I like it,

2
00:00:02,061 --> 00:00:02,701
doing it this way.

3
00:00:02,701 --> 00:00:05,670
We should do it this way more often where
we get the commercials out of the way

4
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:07,170
before the guests arrives.

5
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:08,730
Otherwise it's annoying.

6
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,330
The Joe Rogan experience.

7
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:14,970
Joe Rogan podcast by night all day.

8
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:20,130
We've already been busy
without you people.

9
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:20,971
Ladies and gentlemen,

10
00:00:20,971 --> 00:00:21,870
we're here with live.

11
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,280
Aubrey Marcus is here.

12
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:23,491
Oh,

13
00:00:23,491 --> 00:00:23,911
look at that.

14
00:00:23,911 --> 00:00:25,680
That's my laptop at school.

15
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:26,640
Making noise again,

16
00:00:26,641 --> 00:00:27,261
not old school.

17
00:00:27,261 --> 00:00:28,110
It's this week.

18
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,300
I've done three times a RB.

19
00:00:30,301 --> 00:00:31,081
Marcus is here,

20
00:00:31,081 --> 00:00:31,914
my brother,

21
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:32,341
uh,

22
00:00:32,341 --> 00:00:33,660
and Mr Pressfield.

23
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:34,440
Thank you Sarah.

24
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:35,610
Thank you so much for being here.

25
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:36,503
[inaudible] exciting for me.

26
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:38,070
I tried to do this a few times.

27
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,350
I have been giving out
your book for years.

28
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:42,270
I found you know that a sexy beast.

29
00:00:42,271 --> 00:00:42,841
John Meyer,

30
00:00:42,841 --> 00:00:43,770
you know that Sanger is,

31
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:45,690
you know that guy is John Mayor,

32
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:46,011
mayor,

33
00:00:46,011 --> 00:00:48,360
one of the fucking handsome bastard.

34
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:48,920
Uh,

35
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,610
I was reading his Twitter and he said,

36
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,001
uh,

37
00:00:51,001 --> 00:00:52,140
a long time ago.

38
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:55,890
Something about if you really enjoy for
creative types is a great book called

39
00:00:55,891 --> 00:00:56,411
the war of art.

40
00:00:56,411 --> 00:00:57,750
And then someone else brought it up too.

41
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:58,471
So I said,

42
00:00:58,471 --> 00:00:58,681
all right,

43
00:00:58,681 --> 00:01:00,600
let me check out this book and
see what the fuck is going on.

44
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:02,190
And it's so good.

45
00:01:02,191 --> 00:01:06,390
I bought a stack of them and I kept it
in my office and when podcast guests were

46
00:01:06,391 --> 00:01:06,751
come over,

47
00:01:06,751 --> 00:01:07,080
I would,

48
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:07,741
I'll go committee,

49
00:01:07,741 --> 00:01:08,550
Lazy Bitch,

50
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:10,530
take this and go right,

51
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:12,150
go get something done man.

52
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:13,140
Get something done.

53
00:01:13,141 --> 00:01:14,040
Make it happen.

54
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:14,710
Um,

55
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:15,101
the,

56
00:01:15,101 --> 00:01:16,590
the inspiration of that book,

57
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:18,600
it really works man.

58
00:01:18,601 --> 00:01:19,290
Your book,

59
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:21,750
like it inspires me to get more shit done.

60
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,920
Like you have a w unwittingly,

61
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:25,170
more or willingly,

62
00:01:25,171 --> 00:01:26,250
knowingly or unknowingly.

63
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:30,750
You've liked set an avalanche of
creativity loose with your book.

64
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:31,411
Well,

65
00:01:31,411 --> 00:01:31,861
like I say,

66
00:01:31,861 --> 00:01:33,490
I brought you a half a dozen in the days,

67
00:01:33,491 --> 00:01:33,721
Joe,

68
00:01:33,721 --> 00:01:37,290
so you can give them out to a
deserving a worthy recipient.

69
00:01:37,291 --> 00:01:37,890
So I was like,

70
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:40,680
I was one of those recipients
from Europe from the early days.

71
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:40,921
Yeah,

72
00:01:40,921 --> 00:01:41,820
I gave up on it.

73
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:42,960
Yeah,

74
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,010
it was before on it.

75
00:01:44,011 --> 00:01:45,810
I gave Arby's that coincidence.

76
00:01:45,811 --> 00:01:46,420
I Dunno man.

77
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:46,670
Yeah,

78
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:47,460
I'll probably know.

79
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:48,550
Is that how's it been?

80
00:01:48,551 --> 00:01:49,410
About three years ago,

81
00:01:49,411 --> 00:01:49,980
Huh?

82
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:50,813
Yeah.

83
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:51,271
Yeah.

84
00:01:51,271 --> 00:01:53,340
I gave it to every comedian.

85
00:01:53,341 --> 00:01:57,630
I know that doesn't write new jokes and
I'm one that I know I bought it for my

86
00:01:57,631 --> 00:02:00,570
family for Christmas after you
gave it to me last Christmas.

87
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:01,411
Well you know what,

88
00:02:01,411 --> 00:02:04,230
it's applicable even like to non artists.

89
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:09,190
I think there's a lot of lessons in
that about what you talk about though.

90
00:02:09,191 --> 00:02:09,501
The,

91
00:02:09,501 --> 00:02:13,890
the term resistance is a great way of
describing it because it's sort of names

92
00:02:13,891 --> 00:02:17,340
this fog that a lot of people
have gone through this,

93
00:02:17,341 --> 00:02:20,910
this weird thing that people have where
sometimes I'll wake up in the morning

94
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:22,500
and I'll just,

95
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:24,930
I'll get online and I'll say,

96
00:02:24,931 --> 00:02:25,890
well what do I have to do today?

97
00:02:25,891 --> 00:02:27,180
I got to work out eventually.

98
00:02:27,181 --> 00:02:29,220
So from between now and when I work out,

99
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:30,031
what should I do?

100
00:02:30,031 --> 00:02:30,780
Should I go watch TV?

101
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:32,310
I know the remote is
right there and I know,

102
00:02:32,311 --> 00:02:34,620
I know I really should get something done.

103
00:02:34,621 --> 00:02:36,150
I should just sit in my fucking office,

104
00:02:36,151 --> 00:02:37,380
close the door and start writing.

105
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:41,910
But there's this weird thing that happens
where all these other options come up

106
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:46,340
and it's just so easy to just
fuck off and ask you Joe,

107
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:48,930
cause I don't really know
about how comedians work.

108
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,230
What is the thing that you,

109
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:54,660
that resistance stops you
from doing writing jokes,

110
00:02:54,661 --> 00:02:55,860
sitting down and writing jokes.

111
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,300
I would say writing materials,

112
00:02:57,301 --> 00:03:00,400
the big one because it
stop you from performing.

113
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:02,110
Performing is really fun,

114
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:02,890
you know,

115
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:03,850
performing as a standard,

116
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:05,890
but something that we all
look forward to and it's,

117
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,630
it's a great exchange with the audience.

118
00:03:07,631 --> 00:03:08,560
This is a great time.

119
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:11,620
So that's not something
that anybody resists,

120
00:03:11,621 --> 00:03:13,090
but they do resist the righting,

121
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:16,750
the solid Terry sitting by
yourself with your thoughts.

122
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:17,531
You know,

123
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:17,721
the,

124
00:03:17,721 --> 00:03:22,570
the going over the ideas and trying to
make them work and trying to restructure

125
00:03:22,571 --> 00:03:25,540
stuff to make it quicker
or have more impact.

126
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,141
You know,

127
00:03:26,141 --> 00:03:27,400
sometimes you,

128
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,450
sometimes you have to,

129
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:32,890
sometimes you go over a bit and you'll
practice it on stage and you'll try to

130
00:03:32,891 --> 00:03:35,410
work it out on stage and
you'll eventually get there.

131
00:03:35,411 --> 00:03:38,140
But really what you need
to do is do the real work.

132
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,110
Sit by yourself in front
of a computer or a notepad,

133
00:03:41,111 --> 00:03:41,980
whatever you prefer.

134
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:42,791
And actually,

135
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:43,360
right.

136
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:43,601
You know,

137
00:03:43,601 --> 00:03:47,540
it's interesting to me as just an audience
member because when you watch a comic

138
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:48,430
that's really rolling,

139
00:03:48,431 --> 00:03:50,620
you figure they're just winging it.

140
00:03:50,621 --> 00:03:51,730
It's just coming out of them,

141
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:52,564
you know,

142
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:53,081
the moment.

143
00:03:53,081 --> 00:03:54,160
But it's not true is it?

144
00:03:54,161 --> 00:03:57,280
I mean it's really hard work
behind the scenes doing it.

145
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:58,680
There's actually both.

146
00:03:59,010 --> 00:03:59,311
Um,

147
00:03:59,311 --> 00:04:01,770
there's definitely a lot of
hard work behind the scenes,

148
00:04:01,771 --> 00:04:04,330
but there's also a lot of
winging it and the w the,

149
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:04,570
the,

150
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:06,120
when you get good at winging it,

151
00:04:06,121 --> 00:04:11,121
it sort of comes from already having put
in the work and also having your mind

152
00:04:12,991 --> 00:04:15,150
free if your mind is troubled.

153
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:17,760
Like that's another thing I found,

154
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:18,110
uh,

155
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:18,361
as a,

156
00:04:18,361 --> 00:04:20,430
as I matured as a man,

157
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:22,800
especially over the last like 10,

158
00:04:22,801 --> 00:04:23,634
15 years,

159
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:26,820
I realize the less
clutter I have in my life,

160
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:28,260
the better my mind works.

161
00:04:28,261 --> 00:04:33,261
Like this is a very valuable thing
to keep your mind free of bullshit.

162
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:37,710
So whether it's people or things you
do that you don't like that you do,

163
00:04:37,711 --> 00:04:39,450
or habits that you can't break.

164
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,490
If you can get rid of those,

165
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,680
your whole thing will work better.

166
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:45,990
Like your mind will
actually function better.

167
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:47,310
It will function without the,

168
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:47,990
the,

169
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:51,300
the regret of not being able
to take care of whatever it is.

170
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:52,690
Whether it's a gambling issue or,

171
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:54,060
I've heard you describe too,

172
00:04:54,061 --> 00:04:56,460
when you're in the zone
and doing your best comedy,

173
00:04:56,461 --> 00:04:58,170
it's like the comedy goes through you.

174
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:58,500
Yeah.

175
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:02,430
You're just a passenger and that's very
much how you described the muse and many

176
00:05:02,431 --> 00:05:02,990
of your books.

177
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:03,130
Yeah.

178
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:06,450
That's a very important thing outside
of the getting out of the way.

179
00:05:06,451 --> 00:05:07,410
But yeah,

180
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,560
that's a very important thing that you
brought up in that book and you set it

181
00:05:10,561 --> 00:05:10,850
in,

182
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:11,370
um,

183
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:16,370
sort of a matter of fact way about what's
this ethereal sort of whimsical topic,

184
00:05:17,071 --> 00:05:18,920
the topic of amuse like,

185
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:20,790
but my best stuff,

186
00:05:20,791 --> 00:05:22,200
I have no idea where it came from.

187
00:05:22,201 --> 00:05:23,400
Everything that I've ever written,

188
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:25,680
every time I've ever been on stage.

189
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:26,550
I've been at my,

190
00:05:26,551 --> 00:05:27,151
at my best,

191
00:05:27,151 --> 00:05:28,230
I'm like a passenger.

192
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:31,530
It's like the muse takes you over
when you're actually on stage.

193
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:32,490
Do you

194
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:33,211
five Joe,

195
00:05:33,211 --> 00:05:34,170
over time,

196
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,900
when you look back on what you did,

197
00:05:36,901 --> 00:05:41,901
a set here are set a year ago that
you're discovering who you are as you

198
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:43,230
long.

199
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:43,501
Yeah.

200
00:05:43,501 --> 00:05:44,071
Sorta,

201
00:05:44,071 --> 00:05:44,431
you know,

202
00:05:44,431 --> 00:05:45,151
and sometimes like,

203
00:05:45,151 --> 00:05:45,391
wow,

204
00:05:45,391 --> 00:05:46,224
fuck is that even,

205
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:47,280
you know,

206
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,570
there's definitely a weird,

207
00:05:48,571 --> 00:05:50,210
did that come from element that can,

208
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,210
that can creep in.

209
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:52,021
But yeah,

210
00:05:52,021 --> 00:05:53,520
if you pay attention.

211
00:05:53,521 --> 00:05:55,890
But a lot of comedians don't
like to listen to themselves.

212
00:05:55,891 --> 00:05:56,724
Me included.

213
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:57,733
Don't like to,

214
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:59,340
but that's an also a blog

215
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:02,040
if feel embarrassed
when you see your stuff

216
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,020
weird.

217
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:03,411
First of all,

218
00:06:03,411 --> 00:06:04,760
you're weird if you like it,

219
00:06:04,761 --> 00:06:07,100
you're some that like
listening to yourself,

220
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:07,973
you know,

221
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,340
some guy that gets off
on hearing his own voice,

222
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:11,420
I'm awesome.

223
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:13,370
And then it's also,

224
00:06:13,371 --> 00:06:15,200
it's like if you're self critical,

225
00:06:15,201 --> 00:06:16,760
which I'm very self critical,

226
00:06:16,761 --> 00:06:17,990
it can be agonizing.

227
00:06:17,991 --> 00:06:18,260
You know,

228
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:21,260
there's parts of it that you don't like
that you just like drive you fucking

229
00:06:21,261 --> 00:06:21,830
crazy.

230
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:22,430
Huh.

231
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:23,330
But it's a good way to,

232
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:24,110
for,

233
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:24,650
for uh,

234
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:25,490
creative,

235
00:06:25,491 --> 00:06:26,324
uh,

236
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:28,430
for like structuring acts.

237
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:32,150
It's a really good way to realize what
my bits are working and what bits aren't

238
00:06:32,151 --> 00:06:32,720
working.

239
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:37,040
It's to listen to them without having
to do them so you can actually hear them

240
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:38,780
and hear them take place
in front of an audience.

241
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:42,020
It's actually an invaluable resource
that a lot of comedians don't take

242
00:06:42,021 --> 00:06:44,420
advantage of for just
the reasons I stayed.

243
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:46,550
And they get embarrassed
or they get weirded out.

244
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,730
But there's that thing that
you talked about in your book.

245
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:54,760
It's the Muse and the music exists on
stage and the music exists in front of

246
00:06:54,951 --> 00:06:57,860
your keyboard or a notepad or whatever.

247
00:06:57,861 --> 00:06:59,690
The music with some real shit,

248
00:06:59,691 --> 00:07:00,524
whatever it is.

249
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:00,801
Well,

250
00:07:00,801 --> 00:07:02,660
I'm from the school of it being,

251
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:03,740
of trying to keep it,

252
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:04,910
trying to demystify it,

253
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:05,720
you know,

254
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,160
and because it's,

255
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:10,550
it is as every day as where
do you get an idea from,

256
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:11,660
you know,

257
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:12,620
we're nearing the shower,

258
00:07:12,621 --> 00:07:13,480
you drive around the free,

259
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:14,420
where does it come from?

260
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:16,460
And the point is,

261
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,353
you know,

262
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:21,380
to just get out of the way and let those
things come and not forget them when

263
00:07:21,381 --> 00:07:22,214
they do come.

264
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:22,411
Well,

265
00:07:22,411 --> 00:07:25,770
what was interesting about the way you
wrote about it as well as it was a very

266
00:07:25,771 --> 00:07:30,210
easily digestible to people
because there's some people
that talk about the muse

267
00:07:30,211 --> 00:07:32,130
and I just want to smack them.

268
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,770
I just want to throw them off cliffs.

269
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,240
Just shut up like you're killing
me with your nonsense talk this.

270
00:07:39,241 --> 00:07:40,110
Cause there's people that,

271
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:41,940
obviously I'm joking,

272
00:07:41,941 --> 00:07:46,620
but there's people that go so far into
the whimsical that it becomes this self

273
00:07:46,621 --> 00:07:47,454
indulgent,

274
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:50,310
a artistic expression dance.

275
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:51,600
You know it's like this,

276
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:52,181
you know their,

277
00:07:52,181 --> 00:07:52,451
their,

278
00:07:52,451 --> 00:07:54,660
their whole thing about the muse.

279
00:07:54,661 --> 00:07:59,661
She comes to me the night I leave the
window Shaoshan shall she goes with her

280
00:08:00,541 --> 00:08:02,700
presence in front of my keyboard.

281
00:08:02,701 --> 00:08:03,870
I await her arrival.

282
00:08:03,871 --> 00:08:04,770
Shut the fuck up,

283
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:06,300
you know Jesus Christ.

284
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:11,570
But what you were being honest about is
I believe a psychological or a mental

285
00:08:12,001 --> 00:08:15,420
state that you're in when creativity,

286
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:16,500
whatever that is,

287
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,910
works at its best.

288
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:23,060
And by putting it in your no nonsense
terms and putting in in this really very,

289
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:25,410
very honest term,

290
00:08:25,411 --> 00:08:25,981
like the way you,

291
00:08:25,981 --> 00:08:27,890
the way you are honest description,

292
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:30,000
the way you describe it
as that's what it is.

293
00:08:30,001 --> 00:08:32,640
Like he nailed it and I
think that's what John Mayer,

294
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:33,220
that's what he said,

295
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:33,960
man.

296
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:36,900
That's what John Mayer saw and all
the sudden one of John's Roxburgh

297
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:42,270
well you like him are dreaming
so you might as well be o shot.

298
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:44,880
Um,

299
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:45,900
so you know,

300
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:48,210
whatever it is that creative people,

301
00:08:48,211 --> 00:08:49,200
when they read your book,

302
00:08:49,201 --> 00:08:49,650
they go,

303
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:50,281
that's it.

304
00:08:50,281 --> 00:08:51,120
This guy nailed it.

305
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:52,350
You know that,

306
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,760
that's very important.

307
00:08:53,761 --> 00:08:54,600
What you did is very,

308
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:55,463
very,

309
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:56,010
I haven't even

310
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:56,701
read your fiction.

311
00:08:56,701 --> 00:08:59,660
I've been privileged to watch some of
your movies that people would turn into

312
00:08:59,661 --> 00:09:00,151
your fiction,

313
00:09:00,151 --> 00:09:02,370
but I'm just a big fan of your nonfiction.

314
00:09:02,371 --> 00:09:03,600
I'm going to have to start
reading a fiction now.

315
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:03,851
Well,

316
00:09:03,851 --> 00:09:05,560
I brought a couple here that I got there.

317
00:09:05,561 --> 00:09:08,990
I think that you'll like these one
is gates of fire and the is tied to

318
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,710
or that sounds like some manly shit.

319
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:11,100
Yeah,

320
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,000
red tides of war.

321
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,130
Dawn,

322
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,153
what is it about,

323
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:14,993
yeah,

324
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:15,923
what is it about?

325
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:17,000
Um,

326
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,950
gates of fire is about
the battle of Thermopylae.

327
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:23,280
It's not 300 and not that movie,

328
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:23,790
right?

329
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:26,460
But it's like a good version of that.

330
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:30,960
And tides of war is also said in that era.

331
00:09:30,961 --> 00:09:31,794
It's a different,

332
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,690
a different story about,

333
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,280
um,

334
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,000
by 80 Socrates.

335
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:37,090
Wow.

336
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:37,421
Cool.

337
00:09:37,421 --> 00:09:38,710
Powerful figures from history.

338
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:40,360
It sounds daunting job,

339
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:41,213
but it's not,

340
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:42,220
it sounds awesome.

341
00:09:42,221 --> 00:09:45,190
I'm a huge fan of history over
the last few years especially,

342
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:50,400
but I'm a big fan of a history podcasts
now and we had Greg Proops here

343
00:09:50,741 --> 00:09:51,101
yesterday,

344
00:09:51,101 --> 00:09:55,460
that school this on Columbus
proofs is a huge like history buff,

345
00:09:55,461 --> 00:09:56,860
especially when it comes to Columbus.

346
00:09:56,861 --> 00:09:57,640
And he just,

347
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,540
he's a brilliant guy.

348
00:09:58,541 --> 00:10:02,350
So he's rattling off this the
history of what an asshole Columbus,

349
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:07,630
it's really embarrassing that there's
still a Columbus Day who knew?

350
00:10:07,631 --> 00:10:10,120
I didn't know what a bad guy,

351
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:12,130
he was really a bad guy.

352
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:12,791
But,

353
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:13,120
um,

354
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:13,751
I'm a huge,

355
00:10:13,751 --> 00:10:14,660
huge fan of that,

356
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:15,880
that stuff of just,

357
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:16,391
I just,

358
00:10:16,391 --> 00:10:19,660
it's so fascinating to me that there
was only a few hundred years ago that

359
00:10:19,661 --> 00:10:22,120
people were living this outrageously.

360
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:23,453
Yeah.

361
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:25,570
And you got to read some
more of his nonfiction too.

362
00:10:25,571 --> 00:10:27,250
I just finished the authentic swing.

363
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,330
Really cool books,

364
00:10:28,331 --> 00:10:29,350
especially for writers,

365
00:10:29,351 --> 00:10:29,860
I think,

366
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:30,101
you know,

367
00:10:30,101 --> 00:10:33,760
cause it really goes through his process
of writing the legend of Bagger Vance

368
00:10:33,761 --> 00:10:34,130
and,

369
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:35,140
and talking about that.

370
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:39,640
Really cool to see you kind of
refined some of those same concepts.

371
00:10:39,641 --> 00:10:43,750
And for me as you were talking about the
Muse and getting really a therial for

372
00:10:43,751 --> 00:10:43,961
me,

373
00:10:43,961 --> 00:10:47,980
one thing that you kind of drove home
here is that the muse can be that higher

374
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:50,050
part of ourselves that
we're just tapping into.

375
00:10:50,051 --> 00:10:54,400
And for me that's been one of the key
things in my life is finding the ways to

376
00:10:54,401 --> 00:10:55,180
tap into that.

377
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:55,421
You know,

378
00:10:55,421 --> 00:10:57,730
and I have a bunch of
tricks and tools like,

379
00:10:57,850 --> 00:10:58,090
you know,

380
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:01,150
crazy psychedelic medicine in
the jungles of South America,

381
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:02,860
things like that that helped me get there.

382
00:11:02,861 --> 00:11:04,750
But really the muse can be,

383
00:11:04,751 --> 00:11:04,990
you know,

384
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:07,270
finding that highest part of yourself,

385
00:11:07,271 --> 00:11:09,880
that part of yourself that's tapped
into everything else around you.

386
00:11:09,881 --> 00:11:12,160
And that kind of quantum soup,

387
00:11:12,161 --> 00:11:12,641
as you call it,

388
00:11:12,641 --> 00:11:13,211
the magic,

389
00:11:13,211 --> 00:11:14,950
the source of the universe itself.

390
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:17,710
And I thought that was a really
kind of cool way to draw that in.

391
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:19,870
Well maybe we'll get you
to read that little still.

392
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:20,751
I'm sure it was.

393
00:11:20,751 --> 00:11:20,901
Yeah,

394
00:11:20,901 --> 00:11:21,734
I would love to.

395
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:22,330
Um,

396
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:22,681
the,

397
00:11:22,681 --> 00:11:24,340
the idea of getting out of your own way.

398
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,233
That's a big one.

399
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:26,380
How'd you figure that out?

400
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:28,030
I mean,

401
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:29,260
probably the same way you did.

402
00:11:29,261 --> 00:11:29,651
You know what I mean?

403
00:11:29,651 --> 00:11:30,400
I think it's the,

404
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:35,400
it's anybody that's trying to do
anything in art or filmmaking,

405
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:37,721
painting,

406
00:11:37,721 --> 00:11:40,420
whatever it is you find or,

407
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:42,850
or sports or golf particularly,

408
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:45,880
you find that the tendency
is to try too hard.

409
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:46,720
Right?

410
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,790
You're so you want it so bad,

411
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:49,990
you don't want to screw up.

412
00:11:49,991 --> 00:11:51,040
You want to get it right.

413
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:51,490
You want to,

414
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:51,851
you know,

415
00:11:51,851 --> 00:11:53,050
not embarrass yourself.

416
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:53,381
Right.

417
00:11:53,381 --> 00:11:55,570
And so you wind up trying,

418
00:11:55,571 --> 00:11:55,991
trying,

419
00:11:55,991 --> 00:11:58,390
trying so hard that nothing comes,

420
00:11:58,391 --> 00:11:59,020
you know.

421
00:11:59,020 --> 00:11:59,950
And finally,

422
00:11:59,951 --> 00:12:00,790
like over,

423
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:01,660
over time,

424
00:12:01,661 --> 00:12:03,130
I'm sure this is the same for everybody.

425
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:04,310
You kind of say to yourself,

426
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:04,541
man,

427
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:05,890
I just have to lighten up a little bit.

428
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:06,400
Cause when,

429
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:09,340
when good things happen is
what I'm not trying so hard.

430
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:10,570
And in many ways,

431
00:12:10,571 --> 00:12:12,490
I think that's the hardest thing of all.

432
00:12:12,491 --> 00:12:12,761
I mean,

433
00:12:12,761 --> 00:12:13,090
Aubrey,

434
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:14,680
what you're saying about
being in the jungle,

435
00:12:14,681 --> 00:12:14,990
you know,

436
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:16,000
psychedelic juggle,

437
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:19,390
what that's really all
about is not trying.

438
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:19,721
It's like,

439
00:12:19,721 --> 00:12:22,750
it's like the hardest thing in the
world is to say somebody says to you,

440
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:23,613
relax.

441
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:24,940
Right?

442
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:26,260
Or be yourself.

443
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:27,250
It just be yourself,

444
00:12:27,251 --> 00:12:27,700
Joe.

445
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:28,360
You know,

446
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,020
I mean,

447
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:29,500
and,

448
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:34,500
and yet I think as we
become more professional and
better at what we're doing,

449
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:35,920
when somebody says to you,

450
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:36,820
be yourself,

451
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:37,773
you can,

452
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:38,890
you can,

453
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:39,430
you know,

454
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:43,690
you're not burdened by these false
selves and these things that,

455
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:44,380
uh,

456
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:46,930
that you think you ought to
be or when you want to say,

457
00:12:46,931 --> 00:12:48,850
or how you want to look
or what you ought to be.

458
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,160
You've kind of gotten rid of those,

459
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:51,611
you know,

460
00:12:51,611 --> 00:12:52,600
over time,

461
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:53,860
deliberately,

462
00:12:53,861 --> 00:12:54,820
very deliberately.

463
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:56,110
And I certainly have,

464
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:56,441
you know,

465
00:12:56,441 --> 00:12:56,681
I mean,

466
00:12:56,681 --> 00:12:58,690
I very deliberately tried,

467
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,033
you know,

468
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:04,030
when I feel myself going that
way to pull back and let go.

469
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:04,830
But,

470
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:08,740
and I think in many ways
that's what any artist does.

471
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:10,510
As they become a
professional at what they do,

472
00:13:10,511 --> 00:13:12,520
they learn to kind of
get out of their own way,

473
00:13:12,521 --> 00:13:13,750
and it's the hardest thing of all,

474
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:14,584
I think,

475
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:18,940
and the people we talk about resistance
or the way people screw themselves up,

476
00:13:18,941 --> 00:13:19,774
right?

477
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:22,540
That's how they screw
themselves up is they're in,

478
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:24,100
they're getting in their own way,

479
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:24,610
right?

480
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:26,110
They're listening to their own bullshit.

481
00:13:26,111 --> 00:13:27,900
They're believing it and,

482
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:29,650
and they're,

483
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:31,870
and they're blocked from
whatever they're trying to do.

484
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:33,910
I'm sure that's what the comics,

485
00:13:33,911 --> 00:13:34,091
right,

486
00:13:34,091 --> 00:13:35,710
when they get on stage and they bomb,

487
00:13:35,711 --> 00:13:35,951
right?

488
00:13:35,951 --> 00:13:36,784
That's what's happening.

489
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:37,261
Yeah.

490
00:13:37,261 --> 00:13:39,120
That definitely is a big part of it.

491
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:39,541
The,

492
00:13:39,541 --> 00:13:40,170
the,

493
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:41,230
the what,

494
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:45,810
what I think you're doing that I think
is really cool is that by living your

495
00:13:45,811 --> 00:13:49,320
life and figuring things out and
then documenting and sharing them,

496
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:49,891
sharing them,

497
00:13:49,891 --> 00:13:50,970
like in a really honest way,

498
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:55,950
we are all providing together
what's basically a direction,

499
00:13:55,951 --> 00:13:56,071
man,

500
00:13:56,071 --> 00:13:59,730
you on how to live your life and avoid
a lot of bullshit that most people get

501
00:13:59,731 --> 00:14:00,540
involved with.

502
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:01,260
This is right.

503
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:03,030
This is the stuff they
don't teach you in school.

504
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:03,571
Exactly.

505
00:14:03,571 --> 00:14:05,280
That's because they don't
know we're trying to do.

506
00:14:05,281 --> 00:14:10,281
Now the real problem is the human body
and the human mind is probably the most

507
00:14:11,551 --> 00:14:15,390
complicated vehicle that
the world has ever seen.

508
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:17,660
Forget about all the
rocket ships and all the,

509
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:22,200
the different things that you have to
go through years and years of school

510
00:14:22,201 --> 00:14:24,610
before they let you fuck
with whether it's FAA,

511
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:27,400
18 fighter jets or helicopters,

512
00:14:27,401 --> 00:14:27,720
there's,

513
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,041
there's a,

514
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:30,270
I watched a friend get
his pilot's license.

515
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:34,530
Just studying all aerodynamics and all
these different things you have to know

516
00:14:34,531 --> 00:14:38,040
to take the test and wins and you'd
have to do shit to be a person.

517
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:39,180
You just a person.

518
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,880
I mean it's way crazier
to operate this thing.

519
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,500
I mean it has emotions attached to it.

520
00:14:43,501 --> 00:14:47,790
It can make other people with
its penis which likes rubbing.

521
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:49,320
This is ridiculous.

522
00:14:49,321 --> 00:14:52,310
It's a ridiculous animal
and it's a ridiculous

523
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,340
sort of a thing to try
to manage with no help.

524
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:58,510
And by you writing this book
and people sharing their,

525
00:14:58,511 --> 00:14:59,780
their own personal experiences.

526
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:00,560
And this,

527
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:05,390
one of the things that young
men appreciate the most
about old men is an old man

528
00:15:05,391 --> 00:15:07,250
who will tell you what he did wrong.

529
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,170
Like when I meet young kids and was like,

530
00:15:09,171 --> 00:15:09,950
dude,

531
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:10,783
listen to me.

532
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:11,930
Not going to bullshit you,

533
00:15:11,931 --> 00:15:13,160
but don't do that.

534
00:15:13,161 --> 00:15:13,994
Whatever you do,

535
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,530
don't do this one.

536
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:16,991
That one's stupid.

537
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:18,160
Of course nobody listens.

538
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:19,413
People do.

539
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:24,160
But if there's that old expression that
a wise man learns from the mistakes of

540
00:15:24,161 --> 00:15:24,994
others,

541
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:25,360
right.

542
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,070
A full Nynex zone zone.

543
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:27,870
Yeah.

544
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:31,290
I thought one of the concepts that you
brought up that I really like as well as

545
00:15:31,291 --> 00:15:31,950
that,

546
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:32,251
you know,

547
00:15:32,251 --> 00:15:34,170
it's not so much learning new things,

548
00:15:34,171 --> 00:15:37,620
it's remembering what we've
decided to forget upon,

549
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:37,980
you know,

550
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:38,813
upon birth,

551
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:39,031
you know,

552
00:15:39,031 --> 00:15:39,751
you come from,

553
00:15:39,751 --> 00:15:41,460
if you have that kind
of paradigm of belief,

554
00:15:41,461 --> 00:15:42,720
I don't even think you need it though.

555
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:44,460
So let's say you come from source,

556
00:15:44,461 --> 00:15:48,180
some kind of near perfect knowledge and
then you're born and through whatever

557
00:15:48,181 --> 00:15:49,230
reason you decide,

558
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:49,681
all right,

559
00:15:49,681 --> 00:15:51,150
I'm going to forget
the rules of this game.

560
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:54,180
And Alan Watts talks about it
in a really interesting way of,

561
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:54,900
you know,

562
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,610
if you did have omnipotence,

563
00:15:56,611 --> 00:15:57,750
what would become interesting,

564
00:15:57,751 --> 00:16:01,560
well interesting would be to figure it
out all over again because any known

565
00:16:01,561 --> 00:16:03,030
future is a past,

566
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:03,301
you know,

567
00:16:03,301 --> 00:16:04,740
if it's perfectly known future,

568
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:05,701
it's already happened.

569
00:16:05,701 --> 00:16:06,630
It's happened in your mind,

570
00:16:06,631 --> 00:16:07,464
it's happened there.

571
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,030
So you make this pack to forget.

572
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:12,810
Then you forget everything upon birth
and then as you go through life,

573
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:17,490
you try to remember again as much as you
can by tapping in to that eternal part

574
00:16:17,491 --> 00:16:18,061
of ourselves.

575
00:16:18,061 --> 00:16:19,260
And that's a little bit,

576
00:16:19,261 --> 00:16:22,320
I might have gone a little a little
astray with what you're saying,

577
00:16:22,321 --> 00:16:25,570
but there's a lot of that that you're
talking about it at all with uh,

578
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:26,490
w with the authentic,

579
00:16:26,491 --> 00:16:26,820
yeah.

580
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:27,420
Let me just add,

581
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:28,300
so you have your fairy,

582
00:16:28,301 --> 00:16:29,360
but it isn't right.

583
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:30,740
I mean there's the,

584
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:31,720
the various Smith's,

585
00:16:31,721 --> 00:16:31,901
you know,

586
00:16:31,901 --> 00:16:33,190
this thing on her upper lip,

587
00:16:33,191 --> 00:16:34,450
just a little indentation.

588
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:35,710
Where does that come from?

589
00:16:35,711 --> 00:16:37,630
The myth is that before birth,

590
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:38,650
we knew everything.

591
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:41,100
And an angel just before we were born,

592
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:44,230
touched us right there and nothing
came out again or the other.

593
00:16:44,231 --> 00:16:45,250
Another makes sense.

594
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,960
That's what we call an angel in the,

595
00:16:46,961 --> 00:16:47,370
um,

596
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:48,121
we're a bunch of self,

597
00:16:48,121 --> 00:16:48,954
eight Nass halls.

598
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:50,710
In the Greek world,

599
00:16:50,711 --> 00:16:52,240
there's a thing that when you were,

600
00:16:52,241 --> 00:16:53,440
you had to cross the,

601
00:16:53,441 --> 00:16:54,274
uh,

602
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:54,731
the,

603
00:16:54,731 --> 00:16:55,630
into the underworld.

604
00:16:55,631 --> 00:16:58,480
He had to cross the river that
the ferryman Tokyo across.

605
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,980
And when you were born again,

606
00:16:59,981 --> 00:17:01,210
you had a drink of the river,

607
00:17:01,211 --> 00:17:02,050
the river Liffey,

608
00:17:02,051 --> 00:17:02,291
l,

609
00:17:02,291 --> 00:17:02,381
e,

610
00:17:02,381 --> 00:17:02,651
t,

611
00:17:02,651 --> 00:17:02,891
h,

612
00:17:02,891 --> 00:17:03,550
e.

613
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:05,440
And from that four lethargy,

614
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:09,040
the word comes from as soon as you
drank or that you forgot everything.

615
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:12,190
It was like men in black when they flashed
a little thing in front of your eyes,

616
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:12,640
you know.

617
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,080
Well that's probably analogous,

618
00:17:14,081 --> 00:17:17,880
the psychedelic experiences
because a certain psychedelics,

619
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:19,390
especially DMT,

620
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:20,111
there's one of the,

621
00:17:20,111 --> 00:17:24,490
one of the aspects of it is that your
memory of it goes away almost instantly.

622
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:25,990
Like you have this incredible trip.

623
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:28,780
And then trying to remember
it is like really difficult.

624
00:17:28,781 --> 00:17:30,400
And one of the ways you
remember it is actually,

625
00:17:30,401 --> 00:17:32,200
you remember the way
he described it before.

626
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:34,540
You don't necessarily remember
the experience itself,

627
00:17:34,541 --> 00:17:37,390
which is one of the most incredible
experiences of your life,

628
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:40,060
but there's some
mechanism that's a racing,

629
00:17:40,061 --> 00:17:42,390
that memory in the human
mind and it's the same one.

630
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,500
Interesting Joe and everyone
that works on dreams,

631
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:45,281
dreams,

632
00:17:45,281 --> 00:17:46,600
you forget dreams like that.

633
00:17:46,601 --> 00:17:46,901
Right,

634
00:17:46,901 --> 00:17:50,190
so and there's a way to
help retain some of that.

635
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:53,250
One of the things that we sell is
a supplement called Alpha brain.

636
00:17:53,251 --> 00:17:54,240
It's a nootropic.

637
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:58,320
Nootropics are essentially vitamins and
nutrients that have been shown to have a

638
00:17:58,321 --> 00:18:02,190
positive benefit on cognitive
function and this Alpha brain stuff.

639
00:18:02,191 --> 00:18:04,800
One of the things that it works
great on is lucid dreaming.

640
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:09,210
They found that people that are
practitioners of lucid dreaming this,

641
00:18:09,211 --> 00:18:13,200
this interesting combination of Nutria
could control your dream as apparently

642
00:18:13,201 --> 00:18:16,980
they say that what they can do that lucid
dreamers say that what they can do is

643
00:18:16,981 --> 00:18:18,120
when they get in a dream,

644
00:18:18,121 --> 00:18:21,240
then it's like they're the people
that are really good at it.

645
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:21,900
They,

646
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:22,980
they're basically in a movie,

647
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,440
they can fly there.

648
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:25,320
One of the Avengers,

649
00:18:25,321 --> 00:18:26,430
they're fighting off aliens.

650
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:28,110
They control the entire show.

651
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,550
It sounds amazing.

652
00:18:29,551 --> 00:18:31,680
It seems like something I
should probably look into,

653
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:33,023
but um,

654
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:35,790
but for whatever reason I was drawn to it.

655
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:36,361
Yeah,

656
00:18:36,361 --> 00:18:39,720
there's definitely resistance on that
because it's a really fascinating idea.

657
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:44,840
I've had lucid dreams and the ones that
I had once I started fucking around with

658
00:18:45,001 --> 00:18:45,834
nootropics,

659
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:47,130
they got a lot stronger.

660
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:47,970
Um,

661
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:49,020
of Coleen,

662
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:49,461
there's a,

663
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:53,810
which is one of the ingredients
and a Alpha brand in one,

664
00:18:53,811 --> 00:18:54,030
uh,

665
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:55,140
one of the big,

666
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:55,560
uh,

667
00:18:55,560 --> 00:19:00,560
nootropics that seems to have a
of an effect as does a prasad,

668
00:19:00,601 --> 00:19:02,060
Tim and sandy saying it,

669
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:02,933
pressing him.

670
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,970
And a lot of those are still working
on the acetylcholine mechanism,

671
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:09,390
which is kind of controls the rem
state and that's your dream state.

672
00:19:09,391 --> 00:19:09,690
So,

673
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:09,920
wow,

674
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:10,810
you guys tried to,

675
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:11,800
yeah,

676
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,150
it has an FBI.

677
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:16,350
We like messing with our
mind in a healthy way.

678
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:19,710
You find out that there's stuff that
actually allows you to think a little

679
00:19:19,711 --> 00:19:20,460
crisper.

680
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:20,820
You know,

681
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:23,720
I started looking into it
many years back cause um,

682
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,840
I read about Bill Roman Halsey who was
a football player who's getting a lot of

683
00:19:27,841 --> 00:19:30,510
concussions obviously when he's playing
football and he was having issues

684
00:19:30,511 --> 00:19:34,380
afterwards and he developed this
supplement called neuro one and that's his

685
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:34,890
supplement.

686
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:36,540
It's know added to water and it's,

687
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:37,080
you know,

688
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,030
this interesting mixture of thing.

689
00:19:39,031 --> 00:19:39,271
And I,

690
00:19:39,271 --> 00:19:39,761
I took it,

691
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:40,050
I was like,

692
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:40,380
wow,

693
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:41,670
this is kind of crazy.

694
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,710
Like this is really having
some sort of an effect.

695
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:48,510
But the point being that that's the
only thing that I've ever found that can

696
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:53,540
counteract that sort of legendary thing
of erasing the memory of the fantastic

697
00:19:54,991 --> 00:19:57,330
event because that's a theme.

698
00:19:57,331 --> 00:19:59,460
The erasing the memory
of the fantastic event,

699
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:02,520
the erasing the memory of the
brilliant knowledge by the angels.

700
00:20:02,521 --> 00:20:03,271
You knew everything.

701
00:20:03,271 --> 00:20:03,700
That's what we,

702
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:04,471
you're on Dmt,

703
00:20:04,471 --> 00:20:05,304
you know everything.

704
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:06,390
You figured it all out.

705
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:06,600
It's,

706
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,201
you've got it.

707
00:20:07,201 --> 00:20:07,711
I got it.

708
00:20:07,711 --> 00:20:08,041
I got it.

709
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:08,550
I got it.

710
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:09,211
You sure he got it.

711
00:20:09,211 --> 00:20:09,991
I got it dude.

712
00:20:09,991 --> 00:20:10,824
I got it.

713
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:11,270
Whew.

714
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:12,240
Let me back down to earth.

715
00:20:12,241 --> 00:20:13,500
I swear to God I'm a different person.

716
00:20:13,501 --> 00:20:14,460
I get it.

717
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:17,410
But that that goes into,

718
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:22,420
it goes away and it seems like this
touch of the lip and the drinking of the

719
00:20:22,921 --> 00:20:23,550
water,

720
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:28,550
it's almost like they're trying to put
mythologize this chemical process of the

721
00:20:28,711 --> 00:20:29,100
mind.

722
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:32,370
I think how this Huxley did a really
good job explaining what's going on.

723
00:20:32,371 --> 00:20:36,960
We have this cognitive filter that
decides what is useful to not get eaten by

724
00:20:36,961 --> 00:20:39,330
tigers and to procreate the species.

725
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:40,830
And it's like this gate,

726
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:41,400
you know,

727
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:44,940
he calls it the doors of perception or
cognitive filter and it's this gate and

728
00:20:44,941 --> 00:20:48,040
it only lets in what is for the animal to

729
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:48,850
survive.

730
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:50,650
And so anything else outside of that,

731
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:51,100
you know,

732
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:51,660
the brain says,

733
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:51,821
ah,

734
00:20:51,821 --> 00:20:52,421
we don't need this.

735
00:20:52,421 --> 00:20:52,991
Get rid of this,

736
00:20:52,991 --> 00:20:53,270
get,

737
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:53,800
you know,

738
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,101
De,

739
00:20:54,101 --> 00:20:56,440
prioritize this because
this is an important,

740
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:58,330
and so what psychedelics do,

741
00:20:58,331 --> 00:21:00,970
what dreams do is they open
up the walls of this filter.

742
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:01,301
You know,

743
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:01,610
you tell,

744
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:03,460
look at the mechanism of
action as something like,

745
00:21:03,461 --> 00:21:04,294
so assignment,

746
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:05,950
it's not adding something to your brain.

747
00:21:05,951 --> 00:21:07,900
It's actually shutting down certain parts,

748
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,930
shutting down the default
mode network it's called,

749
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:13,390
which is one of the filtering
devices in the brain.

750
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:18,460
So just more comes in and if you let
more in more of that stuff from the,

751
00:21:18,461 --> 00:21:19,690
beyond the quantum soup,

752
00:21:19,691 --> 00:21:20,500
as you say,

753
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:23,240
you let more of that in while
you can get a little bit closer

754
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:23,600
Dutch,

755
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:27,500
cause you guys just shutting off your
brain like a bunch of fucking morons.

756
00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:29,690
Well you're doing is you should
listen to you over there.

757
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:34,160
You're taking this fucking mushroom
and a shut your brain off and you think

758
00:21:34,161 --> 00:21:34,994
that's good.

759
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:36,290
You think that's a good thing?

760
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:36,700
Well,

761
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:37,930
that's what the science is saying.

762
00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:39,200
What do you think Aubrey,

763
00:21:39,201 --> 00:21:39,650
about that?

764
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:43,250
The idea that door to the
theory that when we're children,

765
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:44,330
when we're infants,

766
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:45,920
we're seeing all that.

767
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:46,830
It's like an asset.

768
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,170
If you look at a kid's eyes,

769
00:21:48,171 --> 00:21:48,980
right?

770
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:50,720
They're not the same as our eyes,

771
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:51,410
you know?

772
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:51,571
Well,

773
00:21:51,571 --> 00:21:52,640
they're looking at the room.

774
00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:54,020
God knows what they're seeing,

775
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,580
but it's not what we're seeing.

776
00:21:55,581 --> 00:21:57,260
And that the process of,

777
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:58,343
um,

778
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:03,040
growing a little bit older is a kind
of a throttling of that aperture right

779
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,550
below that aperture walls.

780
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:05,061
Every,

781
00:22:05,061 --> 00:22:06,050
every year that we live,

782
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:07,910
we build more and more filters more.

783
00:22:07,911 --> 00:22:08,180
Yeah.

784
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:10,220
And we accelerate whatever we do.

785
00:22:10,221 --> 00:22:10,431
You know,

786
00:22:10,431 --> 00:22:12,260
we're trying to push
for a promotion at work,

787
00:22:12,261 --> 00:22:15,530
so we're putting in extra hours and I've
got to bring home some of my projects

788
00:22:15,531 --> 00:22:15,981
and you know,

789
00:22:15,981 --> 00:22:17,840
your kids are growing older and you know,

790
00:22:17,841 --> 00:22:19,670
they're in daycare and you don't see him,

791
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:20,381
but you got to,

792
00:22:20,381 --> 00:22:20,571
you know,

793
00:22:20,571 --> 00:22:22,880
eventually we're going to
get that vacation house and
then everything's going to

794
00:22:22,881 --> 00:22:27,080
come together and went and we complicate
our lives deeper and deeper and deeper

795
00:22:27,081 --> 00:22:27,920
as we get older,

796
00:22:27,921 --> 00:22:29,470
almost as if to avoid

797
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:30,623
silence.

798
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:31,200
Mm.

799
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:31,501
You know,

800
00:22:31,501 --> 00:22:33,000
we claimed all be looking for it,

801
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:38,190
but we just fucking avoiding it at
all costs so much lighter after like a

802
00:22:38,191 --> 00:22:39,720
flotation tank experience.

803
00:22:39,721 --> 00:22:40,040
Yeah.

804
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:44,310
It's just like you can peel off some of
these layers and recover just a fragment

805
00:22:44,311 --> 00:22:46,840
of those child's eyes
that kind of lighthearted.

806
00:22:46,841 --> 00:22:47,490
Yeah.

807
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:47,731
I mean,

808
00:22:47,731 --> 00:22:50,160
it's all a way to me
this just short of what,

809
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:51,043
uh,

810
00:22:51,090 --> 00:22:53,460
the PR producing art is about,

811
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:54,211
you know,

812
00:22:54,211 --> 00:22:55,044
you should,

813
00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:55,501
well,

814
00:22:55,501 --> 00:22:56,161
like for instance,

815
00:22:56,161 --> 00:22:57,770
these two books that I have
been talking about here,

816
00:22:57,790 --> 00:23:01,410
gates of fire and tides
of war at some point I,

817
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:02,190
uh,

818
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:03,240
it's a long story,

819
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:03,991
but,

820
00:23:03,991 --> 00:23:04,824
um,

821
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:08,880
I had to come up with an idea for a
book and so I brought gates of fire,

822
00:23:08,881 --> 00:23:12,990
which was at ancient Greece and next
thing I knew I had done five books about

823
00:23:12,991 --> 00:23:13,561
ancient Greece.

824
00:23:13,561 --> 00:23:15,810
I had never in my life thought about that.

825
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:16,230
Wow.

826
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:17,280
I had no,

827
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:19,620
it wasn't like I was
obsessed with it or anything.

828
00:23:19,621 --> 00:23:20,820
I didn't know anything about it.

829
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:24,630
But some things sort of pulled
me into it and kept me going.

830
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:27,860
So I think in a way that's the,

831
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,330
if you're painting or
you're making a film,

832
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:34,110
you're discovering what you already know.

833
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:35,423
Right.

834
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:36,660
And it's,

835
00:23:36,661 --> 00:23:38,130
it's like it was in you,

836
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:41,520
but you didn't know it was in you and you
don't know it's a new until you see it

837
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:43,950
on the page or it's on a
song or something like that.

838
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:45,680
And what's,

839
00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:46,170
what's

840
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:47,090
kind of weird to me here,

841
00:23:47,091 --> 00:23:47,290
I've,

842
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:48,260
I've written like whatever,

843
00:23:48,261 --> 00:23:49,970
five or six books about ancient Greece,

844
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,390
but yet I'm not remotely
interested in ancient Rome.

845
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:54,253
I just don't give a shit.

846
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:54,441
You know?

847
00:23:54,441 --> 00:23:58,430
It's so why is it a previous life?

848
00:23:59,060 --> 00:23:59,661
What is it?

849
00:23:59,661 --> 00:24:01,550
Some people love the civil war.

850
00:24:01,551 --> 00:24:02,121
They love,

851
00:24:02,121 --> 00:24:02,631
you know,

852
00:24:02,631 --> 00:24:04,460
ancient Ireland,

853
00:24:04,461 --> 00:24:05,630
whatever was all,

854
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:07,940
nobody wants to play the
north in the civil war arena.

855
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:09,770
They're always playing the south,

856
00:24:09,771 --> 00:24:10,604
but it's like,

857
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:14,060
why are we drawn to whatever
it is we're drawing?

858
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:14,931
There's a reason.

859
00:24:14,931 --> 00:24:16,310
It's not just nothing.

860
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:17,323
Yeah.

861
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:18,590
I don't know about that.

862
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:20,620
It might be a con the,

863
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:23,390
an incredible combination
of your genetics,

864
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:25,190
your life experiences,

865
00:24:25,191 --> 00:24:26,180
your atmosphere,

866
00:24:26,181 --> 00:24:30,980
your personal experiences that you've
sort of developed a personality around.

867
00:24:30,981 --> 00:24:34,790
There's so many different variables
that could lead you to be really like,

868
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:35,990
I love werewolves.

869
00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:39,950
Yeah.

870
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:42,470
I've got a four foot tall
werewolf in my lobby,

871
00:24:42,471 --> 00:24:43,550
but it doesn't make any sense.

872
00:24:43,551 --> 00:24:43,731
Like,

873
00:24:43,731 --> 00:24:44,570
what's wrong with me?

874
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:45,350
I don't know.

875
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:46,700
I don't give a shit about the mummy.

876
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:47,853
Yeah.

877
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:49,100
I'm not scared of Frankenstein.

878
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:49,580
You know,

879
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:49,681
it's,

880
00:24:49,681 --> 00:24:50,514
it's not really,

881
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:53,000
it's just a guy or a about that Joe,

882
00:24:53,001 --> 00:24:54,740
is that there is no such
thing as a werewolf.

883
00:24:54,770 --> 00:24:55,211
Exactly.

884
00:24:55,211 --> 00:24:55,380
Right.

885
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:55,911
So stupid.

886
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:57,890
It's not like I could see
being obsessed with wolves,

887
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,000
but werewolf sold there.

888
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:04,240
So that tells me that on some level there
is such a thing as a Werewolf really

889
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:05,800
tells me I'm a retard,

890
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:07,593
but you're not,

891
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:10,240
you're not alone because there are
a lot of people watching Werewolf,

892
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:12,770
at least some archetype
that's represented by the,

893
00:25:12,771 --> 00:25:14,380
where right now some itch that,

894
00:25:14,381 --> 00:25:15,260
that scratching,

895
00:25:15,870 --> 00:25:16,730
it's a deeper,

896
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:17,090
you know,

897
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:18,830
very well is also,

898
00:25:18,831 --> 00:25:21,800
we know that humans very
with a very radically,

899
00:25:21,801 --> 00:25:22,634
we very

900
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:23,780
in our own lives,

901
00:25:23,810 --> 00:25:25,460
we were not like Beatles.

902
00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:27,860
What we essentially move
the same way I do it.

903
00:25:27,861 --> 00:25:28,880
And there's no explosive,

904
00:25:28,881 --> 00:25:29,930
weird actions.

905
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:30,471
We,

906
00:25:30,471 --> 00:25:32,300
humans are constantly varying,

907
00:25:32,301 --> 00:25:33,020
varying.

908
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:34,770
Whether or not you're enjoying the,

909
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,690
your interactions with other people or in,

910
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:39,290
in pain because of them varying.

911
00:25:39,291 --> 00:25:42,770
Whether or not you're an ecstasy because
of your movements are just terribly

912
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:46,730
like stressed out and stuck in traffic
and good coming from a job that sucks to

913
00:25:46,731 --> 00:25:46,930
uh,

914
00:25:46,930 --> 00:25:47,260
uh,

915
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:47,441
uh,

916
00:25:47,441 --> 00:25:49,910
a marriage that's fucking poisoning you.

917
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:52,820
There's this of the
variations are massive.

918
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:54,050
So because of that,

919
00:25:54,051 --> 00:25:58,310
the possibilities of each individual
interaction that you have with people is

920
00:25:58,311 --> 00:25:59,090
crazy.

921
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:03,290
So you could run into someone that feels
like a wild animal and you know that

922
00:26:03,291 --> 00:26:05,840
that's a part of people
and you know that you very,

923
00:26:05,841 --> 00:26:08,000
and then if someone threatens
your children something,

924
00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:09,710
this shit does come out of you.

925
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:13,130
That's so primal that it doesn't
even have a language attached to it.

926
00:26:13,131 --> 00:26:17,300
The movements have nothing to do
with morality or ethics or law.

927
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:21,870
They have to do with primal DNA
seeking to stay around seeking.

928
00:26:21,871 --> 00:26:22,704
You stay alive.

929
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:24,710
And that's a wolf.

930
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:25,633
That's a wolf.

931
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,900
That's what a wolf is.

932
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:27,471
I mean,

933
00:26:27,471 --> 00:26:28,460
a wolf is prime.

934
00:26:28,461 --> 00:26:30,680
If you've ever had an
interaction with an animal,

935
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:31,880
a real interaction,

936
00:26:31,881 --> 00:26:33,920
even if it's a fucking squirrel
that wants to kick your ass,

937
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:35,900
scary as shit.

938
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:40,730
Because like we were talking yesterday
about baboons and about how evil baboons

939
00:26:40,731 --> 00:26:42,900
are and Greg Proops of saying that they,

940
00:26:43,050 --> 00:26:43,590
they,

941
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:46,500
they will rush women in
Africa where you know,

942
00:26:46,501 --> 00:26:46,760
they're,

943
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:50,660
they're local and they'll rush women at
the grocery store and just fucking steal

944
00:26:50,661 --> 00:26:55,661
their shit and look at him and like
you were looking at a monster and just

945
00:26:55,771 --> 00:26:57,780
because it hasn't decided
to kill you and eat you,

946
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,460
it doesn't mean it's because it can,

947
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:00,510
it certainly can.

948
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:02,460
It's much stronger than you.

949
00:27:02,461 --> 00:27:03,870
It has a face of a dog.

950
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:07,020
It's got a brain of a monkey and
it's stealing your groceries.

951
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:08,880
You mean that's a werewolf,

952
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:09,291
that's,

953
00:27:09,291 --> 00:27:09,781
that's this,

954
00:27:09,781 --> 00:27:14,781
this thing of having this interaction
with something that has no law to it and

955
00:27:15,901 --> 00:27:16,021
then it,

956
00:27:16,021 --> 00:27:17,130
it comes out of a person.

957
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:19,920
I've seen that sort of the
anthropomorphic side of a thing.

958
00:27:19,921 --> 00:27:20,690
Like we,

959
00:27:20,690 --> 00:27:23,100
we have this idea that
the wolves are clever,

960
00:27:23,101 --> 00:27:26,910
like a person as well because wolves are
really fucking smart and they do a lot

961
00:27:26,911 --> 00:27:27,744
of creepy shit.

962
00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:31,590
Like they set up people like one wolf
will come out and actually walk with the

963
00:27:31,591 --> 00:27:33,750
fake limp so they can like get,

964
00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:34,500
uh,

965
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:34,861
other,

966
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:35,520
uh,

967
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,770
other people are predators close to it.

968
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:38,101
Yeah,

969
00:27:38,101 --> 00:27:38,761
they're creepers,

970
00:27:38,761 --> 00:27:39,031
man.

971
00:27:39,031 --> 00:27:39,930
They're really smart.

972
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,460
So you're a student of this stuff.

973
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:42,443
Wolves.

974
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:42,960
Wolves.

975
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:43,230
Yeah.

976
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:47,370
I'm fascinated by anything that can kill
me perhaps or done any vivid dreaming

977
00:27:47,371 --> 00:27:48,740
on the subject of Wolf's?

978
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:49,291
Well,

979
00:27:49,291 --> 00:27:51,330
I've had some nightmares.

980
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:52,460
Definitely.

981
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:55,120
I have one really weird dream
that wasn't a nightmare.

982
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:55,620
Gorilla,

983
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:56,290
right?

984
00:27:56,290 --> 00:27:56,800
Yeah.

985
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,050
Well the Werewolf and grill,

986
00:27:58,051 --> 00:28:01,170
we're having sex and I was trying to get
out of the room for anybody noticed and

987
00:28:01,171 --> 00:28:03,340
I was like creeping like
around the edge of the,

988
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:04,681
the walls,

989
00:28:04,681 --> 00:28:05,520
like really slowly.

990
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:07,590
And then someone actually sent me a,

991
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:09,900
a wolf and a gorilla having sex.

992
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:10,831
Like they,

993
00:28:10,831 --> 00:28:11,400
uh,

994
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:11,760
they,

995
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,880
they put it together
and like this structure,

996
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,800
but the weirdest dream that I ever had,

997
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:17,723
um,

998
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:18,211
it was,

999
00:28:18,211 --> 00:28:18,840
uh,

1000
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:21,420
I don't know if I was a wolf
or some sort of an animal,

1001
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:23,640
but there was some sort of
another animal next to me.

1002
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:24,080
You know,

1003
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,610
it's weird to try to remember
exactly what it looked like.

1004
00:28:26,611 --> 00:28:27,690
It was like something canine,

1005
00:28:27,691 --> 00:28:29,160
something like canine,

1006
00:28:29,161 --> 00:28:34,161
not a cap and we're walking through
this rain forest and water's dripping

1007
00:28:34,621 --> 00:28:38,490
everywhere and water's like hitting my
nose and I can smell shit that I have

1008
00:28:38,491 --> 00:28:41,550
never smelled before and I can smell fear.

1009
00:28:41,730 --> 00:28:45,720
I could smell this deer and the
deer hears like game of Thrones.

1010
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:50,740
The deer hears a stick snap and
the deers fear comes out like a,

1011
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:54,150
like a puff of mist and then I wake up.

1012
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:55,733
It's a weird,

1013
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:57,060
it's a weird dream.

1014
00:28:57,090 --> 00:29:02,090
It happened a couple of times where I
had this like this glimpse of like an

1015
00:29:02,341 --> 00:29:04,980
animal stalking things
and smelling things,

1016
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:08,400
but it's most likely just my imagination
with all the things that I've read

1017
00:29:08,401 --> 00:29:09,900
about like dogs and stark.

1018
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:10,620
I wonder,

1019
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:15,210
I wonder if there's a like a part of us
that's kind of repressed in the society

1020
00:29:15,211 --> 00:29:16,020
we live in now.

1021
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:16,290
You know,

1022
00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:17,800
like we have to apart keep,

1023
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:18,510
yeah,

1024
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:19,220
good amount.

1025
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:20,610
I know there's a huge part of us,

1026
00:29:20,611 --> 00:29:21,001
perhaps,

1027
00:29:21,001 --> 00:29:22,680
that we're keeping under wraps and saying,

1028
00:29:22,681 --> 00:29:22,831
no,

1029
00:29:22,831 --> 00:29:22,951
no,

1030
00:29:22,951 --> 00:29:23,310
no,

1031
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:24,330
you can't come out and play.

1032
00:29:24,331 --> 00:29:27,720
You can't come out and play that kind
of savage beast to the animal that's

1033
00:29:27,721 --> 00:29:32,721
inside of us that not many of us get
to explore at all or release it all,

1034
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:33,150
you know,

1035
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:35,010
back many years ago is,

1036
00:29:35,011 --> 00:29:35,311
you know,

1037
00:29:35,311 --> 00:29:36,144
and these tails,

1038
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:40,410
there was opportunity for almost every
adult male to enter this hand to hand

1039
00:29:40,411 --> 00:29:41,950
combat where could unleash

1040
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,080
this whatever beast was inside of you,

1041
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:46,000
you got to let it out.

1042
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:49,540
And perhaps they didn't really care
that much about werewolves at that point

1043
00:29:49,541 --> 00:29:52,540
because they got to itch that
scratch directly a sword.

1044
00:29:52,541 --> 00:29:54,130
So do you think that there's something,

1045
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,090
you know,

1046
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:56,790
if you're going to diagnose the,

1047
00:29:56,791 --> 00:30:00,340
the male species been particular and
then probably another one for the female

1048
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:01,443
that's kind of,

1049
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:05,290
we're struggling with because we don't
have that outlet in our society where

1050
00:30:05,291 --> 00:30:06,124
absolutely.

1051
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:06,581
I mean,

1052
00:30:06,581 --> 00:30:06,981
I think,

1053
00:30:06,981 --> 00:30:07,581
and that,

1054
00:30:07,581 --> 00:30:08,414
uh,

1055
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:09,351
I was just,

1056
00:30:09,351 --> 00:30:11,930
I'm just reading a book
about the Comanche's,

1057
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:12,891
you know,

1058
00:30:12,891 --> 00:30:17,891
and whatever it would allege 1860 in
Texas and the incredible horror that these

1059
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:20,750
cruelty and,

1060
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:21,590
and,

1061
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:24,560
and also incredible endurance cleverness,

1062
00:30:24,561 --> 00:30:26,900
cunningness rapaciousness,

1063
00:30:26,901 --> 00:30:27,320
you know,

1064
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:31,430
that they exhibited and
that's like 150 years ago.

1065
00:30:31,431 --> 00:30:32,870
It is so far gone.

1066
00:30:33,410 --> 00:30:35,960
The world that we live to
drive in a Santa Monica,

1067
00:30:35,961 --> 00:30:37,760
get a Carmel Macchiato,

1068
00:30:38,150 --> 00:30:38,451
you know,

1069
00:30:38,451 --> 00:30:40,490
come back whatever you do.

1070
00:30:40,491 --> 00:30:41,324
Right.

1071
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,470
And I mean,

1072
00:30:42,471 --> 00:30:45,440
I can see just sitting here in
this room with the four guys,

1073
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:48,710
there's tremendous testosterone
hanging around in this room.

1074
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:51,920
I feel like I want to put an m four
and everybody's hand and tell you,

1075
00:30:51,930 --> 00:30:52,120
go,

1076
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:52,310
you know,

1077
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:54,890
start killing people
and you'll be not here.

1078
00:30:54,891 --> 00:30:55,724
I'd be of course,

1079
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,560
but I think it's an,

1080
00:30:57,570 --> 00:31:02,570
I really think you see this dark
side to me everywhere in marriages,

1081
00:31:04,010 --> 00:31:04,840
in,

1082
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:05,240
you know,

1083
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:08,760
kids to parents in the
dysfunction of the governor.

1084
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:11,420
Look at the government now with
the shutdown and all this stuff.

1085
00:31:11,421 --> 00:31:12,800
You can't tell me that,

1086
00:31:12,801 --> 00:31:16,640
that's not some kind of forced that

1087
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:22,940
found expression a few hundred years ago
and doesn't find expression in anymore.

1088
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:24,103
So,

1089
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:24,831
you know,

1090
00:31:24,831 --> 00:31:29,660
Norman mailer had this idea years
ago that to help stop crime,

1091
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:32,120
he had this idea of an adventurer core.

1092
00:31:32,121 --> 00:31:33,170
Have you ever heard about this?

1093
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:34,910
One of his deals was,

1094
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:35,541
you know,

1095
00:31:35,541 --> 00:31:36,081
the old,

1096
00:31:36,081 --> 00:31:36,500
um,

1097
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:41,500
wind jammer ships that like
a would require a crew of
150 to go up in the sales

1098
00:31:42,621 --> 00:31:44,330
and sail around Cape Horn.

1099
00:31:44,331 --> 00:31:45,164
And it was like,

1100
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:45,471
you know,

1101
00:31:45,471 --> 00:31:50,150
adventure wild if he had an idea to have
like a hundred of these ships and just

1102
00:31:50,151 --> 00:31:55,151
get young testosterone crazed kids out
of the bad environments that they were in

1103
00:31:56,090 --> 00:31:56,930
and get them,

1104
00:31:57,050 --> 00:31:57,351
you know,

1105
00:31:57,351 --> 00:31:59,780
facing real shit out
there in the real world.

1106
00:32:00,050 --> 00:32:00,883
And he thought that,

1107
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:01,160
you know,

1108
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:04,070
that would be very interesting
for them and for everybody.

1109
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:05,300
And I think there's a lot to that.

1110
00:32:05,301 --> 00:32:07,430
Why do people join the army now?

1111
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:09,470
Why do they want to
volunteer for Afghanistan?

1112
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:13,100
Because they care about bringing
peace or the American way.

1113
00:32:13,610 --> 00:32:13,791
Well,

1114
00:32:13,791 --> 00:32:17,600
there's also people don't know what the
fuck to do is also that it's a job that

1115
00:32:17,601 --> 00:32:19,760
people can get in places
where there's no jobs.

1116
00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:20,960
The guaranteed living,

1117
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:23,000
you have family that's
been in the military.

1118
00:32:23,001 --> 00:32:25,820
That's the pivot that people that
I know that join the military,

1119
00:32:25,821 --> 00:32:26,930
it's usually those things.

1120
00:32:27,490 --> 00:32:28,100
Uh,

1121
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:28,271
it,

1122
00:32:28,271 --> 00:32:33,271
it's a social substitute for writers
passage to another as I have a lot of

1123
00:32:33,981 --> 00:32:36,620
people that read my books
are in the military.

1124
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:38,420
You know what I may write
to me and that da a,

1125
00:32:38,421 --> 00:32:39,650
and I can you that,

1126
00:32:39,651 --> 00:32:40,484
uh,

1127
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:45,490
they respond to the
concept of a code of honor,

1128
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:47,780
the concept of the warrior ethos.

1129
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:48,801
And in fact,

1130
00:32:48,801 --> 00:32:52,220
what's frustrating to them about the
military unless they're in really elite

1131
00:32:52,221 --> 00:32:52,970
units,

1132
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:54,170
is that they don't get that.

1133
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:55,700
It's just the bullshit of,

1134
00:32:55,701 --> 00:32:56,150
you know,

1135
00:32:56,150 --> 00:32:57,020
whatever it is,

1136
00:32:57,320 --> 00:33:01,760
and they're not called on to
really perform at the high,

1137
00:33:01,761 --> 00:33:04,040
high level that they know
they wish they could.

1138
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:07,490
And you guys are into that with your
supplementation and the stuff that you do,

1139
00:33:07,491 --> 00:33:09,740
you're trying to get to some level that's,

1140
00:33:09,910 --> 00:33:10,230
you know,

1141
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:11,063
beyond,

1142
00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:12,263
yeah.

1143
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:16,050
I think to summarize what we're saying
here is that the problem with the world

1144
00:33:16,051 --> 00:33:20,710
is weak bitches [inaudible] dudes out
there that a week pitches and we all could

1145
00:33:20,711 --> 00:33:24,420
have been a weak bitch or could have
been at one point in our lives a week

1146
00:33:24,421 --> 00:33:25,110
bitch.

1147
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:28,200
And that's that the lack of discipline,

1148
00:33:28,201 --> 00:33:30,480
the lack of a quality character.

1149
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:34,170
That's the one thing that we find like
most distasteful and other people,

1150
00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:36,180
when you see some weasley God,

1151
00:33:36,181 --> 00:33:37,710
it's going to sell his
friends down the river.

1152
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:40,230
I remember I was watching
punked once and uh,

1153
00:33:40,231 --> 00:33:41,340
we're not saying anybody's name,

1154
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:42,350
but uh,

1155
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:47,350
somebody we got punked and they sold
their friends out to this fake FBI guy and

1156
00:33:47,521 --> 00:33:47,850
uh,

1157
00:33:47,850 --> 00:33:48,640
and I watched that.

1158
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:48,990
I go,

1159
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:50,640
that guy is a bitch.

1160
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:51,960
And like to this day,

1161
00:33:51,961 --> 00:33:52,860
if I ever see that guy,

1162
00:33:52,861 --> 00:33:54,000
I don't say hi to them.

1163
00:33:54,001 --> 00:33:54,810
I avoid them.

1164
00:33:54,810 --> 00:33:55,170
I'm like,

1165
00:33:55,170 --> 00:33:57,030
that's a weasley dude.

1166
00:33:57,150 --> 00:33:59,130
That's a belated the coat of arms.

1167
00:33:59,610 --> 00:34:00,600
There's no character there.

1168
00:34:00,601 --> 00:34:01,434
There's no like,

1169
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:01,741
well,

1170
00:34:01,741 --> 00:34:02,890
you're supposed to do the,

1171
00:34:02,891 --> 00:34:03,161
the,

1172
00:34:03,161 --> 00:34:05,190
the F if it's a fucking card game.

1173
00:34:05,191 --> 00:34:05,491
Okay,

1174
00:34:05,491 --> 00:34:07,020
what's the worst thing that's
going to happen to you?

1175
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:07,800
Dummy.

1176
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:08,910
The FBI comes and they,

1177
00:34:08,911 --> 00:34:09,151
you know,

1178
00:34:09,151 --> 00:34:10,080
they tell you they're their,

1179
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:10,600
their stone.

1180
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:10,831
You Go,

1181
00:34:10,831 --> 00:34:11,280
what?

1182
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,360
I've got to talk to my lawyer.

1183
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:14,160
I don't know what the fuck
you're saying right now.

1184
00:34:14,161 --> 00:34:15,960
I'm talking to my lawyer like I'm done.

1185
00:34:15,961 --> 00:34:16,890
We're done talking.

1186
00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:19,530
As soon as you say you were the FBI
and you're breaking up a card game,

1187
00:34:19,950 --> 00:34:20,221
I'm like,

1188
00:34:20,221 --> 00:34:20,850
what?

1189
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:21,211
Yeah.

1190
00:34:21,211 --> 00:34:21,690
Okay.

1191
00:34:21,690 --> 00:34:22,170
Take care.

1192
00:34:22,170 --> 00:34:22,980
Good luck with that.

1193
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:23,880
I don't know what you're talking about.

1194
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:26,370
I'm not going to give up my
fucking friends like a bitch.

1195
00:34:26,610 --> 00:34:28,320
But those people that do do that,

1196
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:29,610
there's scary.

1197
00:34:29,611 --> 00:34:30,450
They're creepers.

1198
00:34:30,451 --> 00:34:31,740
They're around us all the time.

1199
00:34:31,741 --> 00:34:32,574
And that,

1200
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:35,130
that comes from a lack of doing the work.

1201
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:36,660
It comes from a lack of self,

1202
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:37,583
uh,

1203
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:43,100
self analysis of objective thinking comes
from a lack of a meditation comes from

1204
00:34:45,091 --> 00:34:47,410
a lack of being actually aware of the,

1205
00:34:47,411 --> 00:34:49,200
the true nature of your actions,

1206
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:50,940
the true nature of your behavior.

1207
00:34:51,010 --> 00:34:52,570
Let me change the subject slightly,

1208
00:34:52,571 --> 00:34:54,430
although it's not really
changing the subject,

1209
00:34:54,431 --> 00:34:55,510
but to ask you a question,

1210
00:34:55,511 --> 00:34:55,850
Joe,

1211
00:34:55,850 --> 00:34:56,290
okay,

1212
00:34:56,290 --> 00:35:00,820
why did you start this podcast
and what is your intention,

1213
00:35:00,821 --> 00:35:02,680
your longterm intention here?

1214
00:35:02,830 --> 00:35:03,670
Does zero,

1215
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:04,690
zero longterm,

1216
00:35:04,691 --> 00:35:05,260
and it's,

1217
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:07,360
this is one of those things
that sort of made itself.

1218
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:07,870
Um,

1219
00:35:07,870 --> 00:35:12,640
we knew of a few friends that
had a podcast that they did.

1220
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:13,271
Um,

1221
00:35:13,271 --> 00:35:15,550
my friend Anthony [inaudible]
who's on the show,

1222
00:35:15,551 --> 00:35:16,384
opie and Anthony,

1223
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:21,040
he has a basement in his house where
he set up a full studio with HD

1224
00:35:21,041 --> 00:35:23,980
professional cameras and a
green screen and he like,

1225
00:35:23,981 --> 00:35:26,770
he'll put like space behind him
or New York City behind them.

1226
00:35:26,771 --> 00:35:27,604
It's amazing.

1227
00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:28,301
It's really cool.

1228
00:35:28,301 --> 00:35:28,841
Which by the way,

1229
00:35:28,841 --> 00:35:29,830
we're going to get one of those things.

1230
00:35:29,831 --> 00:35:31,060
It's called a tri caster.

1231
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:32,260
And my friend Justin,

1232
00:35:32,261 --> 00:35:33,190
who was in the other day,

1233
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,290
he uses him for is the actual report,

1234
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:38,790
but he did it and it looked cool.

1235
00:35:38,791 --> 00:35:39,451
It looked like fun.

1236
00:35:39,451 --> 00:35:42,660
He would just have a couple of drinks
with his buddies and do Karaoke while

1237
00:35:42,661 --> 00:35:43,770
holding a machine gun and he's,

1238
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:44,873
he's fucking crazy.

1239
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:45,960
But,

1240
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,280
so Brian and I started it.

1241
00:35:47,310 --> 00:35:47,530
Uh,

1242
00:35:47,530 --> 00:35:48,660
it'll be four years ago,

1243
00:35:48,661 --> 00:35:49,494
December.

1244
00:35:49,610 --> 00:35:50,091
Uh,

1245
00:35:50,091 --> 00:35:50,451
yeah.

1246
00:35:50,451 --> 00:35:51,590
It was just no Christmas.

1247
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:52,483
That's crazy.

1248
00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:53,230
Yeah.

1249
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:58,230
I just did you sit down and say we want
to do this or you now Brian's been,

1250
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:03,730
we were looking for something to do like
two to four Joe's fans because Joey had

1251
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:07,550
so many fans and we would make these
videos and they were nice but it was so

1252
00:36:07,551 --> 00:36:09,890
hard to edit all of this video
and only came out once a month.

1253
00:36:09,891 --> 00:36:12,800
So we were kind of looking for something
that said Joe can interact with his

1254
00:36:12,801 --> 00:36:16,280
fans faster for someone who's on the
outside looking at the podcast cause you

1255
00:36:16,281 --> 00:36:17,530
guys are right in it and I've,

1256
00:36:17,531 --> 00:36:18,830
I've obviously been a part of it.

1257
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:19,970
I think what,

1258
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:25,010
what has happened there is Joe is one
of the best examples I've ever seen.

1259
00:36:25,011 --> 00:36:26,990
If somebody's living his authentic self,

1260
00:36:27,290 --> 00:36:30,590
I have in all of my travels
and journeys everywhere.

1261
00:36:30,830 --> 00:36:35,830
Have I ever met a person who I could
count on to be 100% Joe fucking Robin,

1262
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:38,630
you know himself always at,

1263
00:36:38,631 --> 00:36:38,901
you know,

1264
00:36:38,901 --> 00:36:40,130
at any point in time.

1265
00:36:40,370 --> 00:36:42,590
And so I think even without a plan,

1266
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,120
his authentic self,

1267
00:36:44,121 --> 00:36:45,470
what he was bringing,

1268
00:36:45,471 --> 00:36:49,580
what's inside his heart and his spirit
was going to play out on this stage

1269
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:50,241
regardless.

1270
00:36:50,241 --> 00:36:51,080
He couldn't help it,

1271
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:51,560
you know,

1272
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:54,260
he couldn't strategize or
plan what was going to be,

1273
00:36:54,261 --> 00:36:59,000
he could just be himself and do
the podcast and then here you go.

1274
00:36:59,001 --> 00:36:59,511
Here it is,

1275
00:36:59,511 --> 00:37:00,620
here's the manifestation.

1276
00:37:00,621 --> 00:37:03,580
And that in itself was in lieu of a plan.

1277
00:37:03,770 --> 00:37:04,603
I mean I she,

1278
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:08,150
I could tell the sort of embarrassed as
you Joe for me to ask you this stuff,

1279
00:37:08,450 --> 00:37:12,650
but bear with me because it certainly
seems I'm from the outside coming here.

1280
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:17,980
It certainly seems like in a way you or
your teacher as this environment here

1281
00:37:18,501 --> 00:37:21,070
hedge definitely has to do with maleness,

1282
00:37:21,370 --> 00:37:22,180
right?

1283
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:25,100
Short seems to me like
asking the question,

1284
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,073
he was on your,

1285
00:37:26,690 --> 00:37:26,961
you know,

1286
00:37:26,961 --> 00:37:27,560
you're,

1287
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:29,720
you're joking about that but you are,

1288
00:37:30,410 --> 00:37:31,243
you need it.

1289
00:37:31,570 --> 00:37:32,720
A bunch of weak bitches up there.

1290
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:33,671
Well there it is.

1291
00:37:33,671 --> 00:37:36,620
It's an uptime like chopper would say.

1292
00:37:40,850 --> 00:37:43,310
So you might not have known that when,

1293
00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:45,080
when you and Brian started this,

1294
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:48,200
but I think it was kind of
oozing out of your pores,

1295
00:37:48,201 --> 00:37:48,710
you know,

1296
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:49,790
it could be why,

1297
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:50,930
let me ask you this,

1298
00:37:50,931 --> 00:37:51,111
let me,

1299
00:37:51,111 --> 00:37:52,070
let's put her in a different way.

1300
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:57,440
What characteristics do you look for in
guests that you invite onto the show?

1301
00:37:57,890 --> 00:37:58,101
Oh,

1302
00:37:58,101 --> 00:37:59,090
they're so varied.

1303
00:37:59,210 --> 00:37:59,660
Um,

1304
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:02,690
fun either Joey Diaz type
dudes are just funny.

1305
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:03,051
You know,

1306
00:38:03,051 --> 00:38:03,261
I've,

1307
00:38:03,261 --> 00:38:04,850
I've friends that are just funny,

1308
00:38:04,851 --> 00:38:06,060
I just want them to be funny.

1309
00:38:06,061 --> 00:38:06,231
It just,

1310
00:38:06,231 --> 00:38:07,730
we have just laughs.

1311
00:38:07,731 --> 00:38:10,130
And then there's other people
who were very philosophical,

1312
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:12,320
these people that I don't
necessarily even agree with,

1313
00:38:12,321 --> 00:38:16,100
but they have a very well thought out
opinion and I like to explore other

1314
00:38:16,101 --> 00:38:16,790
opinions.

1315
00:38:16,790 --> 00:38:18,140
What I think happened is,

1316
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:19,613
um,

1317
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,800
because of what I do,

1318
00:38:21,801 --> 00:38:23,810
because I'm a professional comedian,

1319
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:25,370
I'm always looking at things,

1320
00:38:25,371 --> 00:38:26,870
but it's also that,

1321
00:38:26,990 --> 00:38:28,520
that's who I was anyway.

1322
00:38:28,790 --> 00:38:29,241
And it's just,

1323
00:38:29,241 --> 00:38:33,440
I found a good job for trying to
analyze when I was a young boy.

1324
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:36,850
My parents split up when
I was five years old and,

1325
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:37,331
uh,

1326
00:38:37,331 --> 00:38:38,660
it was a really bad breakup.

1327
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:43,710
Like a lot of domestic violence and if I
had to pinpoint a moment that like that

1328
00:38:44,621 --> 00:38:47,620
part of my life made me go,

1329
00:38:47,621 --> 00:38:48,454
you know what,

1330
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:53,650
I have a feeling that I just been shit
out into this world that no one knows how

1331
00:38:53,651 --> 00:38:57,100
the fuck anything works and
everybody's just bumping into walls.

1332
00:38:57,310 --> 00:39:01,000
And as a five year old I remember
looking around cause I just,

1333
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:02,920
I just started going to Catholic school,

1334
00:39:02,921 --> 00:39:04,270
which I realized was utter Horse Shit.

1335
00:39:04,271 --> 00:39:06,100
I'm like oh great is not really there.

1336
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,210
And then my,

1337
00:39:07,210 --> 00:39:08,590
my family's not real.

1338
00:39:08,591 --> 00:39:09,610
Like religion is not real.

1339
00:39:09,611 --> 00:39:10,421
So being like five,

1340
00:39:10,421 --> 00:39:11,254
six years old,

1341
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:14,680
I think it made me just start
thinking about things constantly.

1342
00:39:14,681 --> 00:39:16,930
Like my brain is never rest.

1343
00:39:16,931 --> 00:39:19,000
It's very rare that I can just chill out.

1344
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:20,740
Even when I'm watching something,

1345
00:39:20,741 --> 00:39:22,810
like I'll have two things
going on in the background.

1346
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:23,530
Like I'll,

1347
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:26,610
I'll start playing games with myself
in the back of my mind it's like it's,

1348
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:28,720
it's a weird thing like I have,

1349
00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:32,980
there's too many things going
on in my head at all the time.

1350
00:39:32,981 --> 00:39:34,270
So because of that,

1351
00:39:34,271 --> 00:39:39,271
like the best way to exercise that is
like to find something like a podcast

1352
00:39:39,970 --> 00:39:44,380
where you can have a conversation with
people for three hours and just sit down

1353
00:39:44,381 --> 00:39:48,010
and shoot the shit about things and then
explore subjects and no one looks at

1354
00:39:48,011 --> 00:39:48,790
their phone,

1355
00:39:48,790 --> 00:39:49,271
no one,

1356
00:39:49,271 --> 00:39:49,541
you know,

1357
00:39:49,541 --> 00:39:50,950
no one takes any emails.

1358
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:54,790
That's a rare thing in this society today.

1359
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,190
And to be able to do that
and to have that sort of a,

1360
00:39:58,340 --> 00:39:59,620
an environment,

1361
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:00,521
for me,

1362
00:40:00,521 --> 00:40:01,354
it's perfect.

1363
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:02,500
So it's it,

1364
00:40:02,770 --> 00:40:05,200
it's being a student as well
as being a teacher in a way.

1365
00:40:05,201 --> 00:40:05,540
It's a,

1366
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:05,861
you know,

1367
00:40:05,861 --> 00:40:06,640
you're learning,

1368
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:09,340
being constantly fascinated and I
think if you're paying attention,

1369
00:40:09,341 --> 00:40:10,960
how can you not be constantly fascinating?

1370
00:40:11,050 --> 00:40:12,610
The world is just,

1371
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:17,320
every day there's a river of slippery
salmon of knowledge and it's,

1372
00:40:17,321 --> 00:40:18,790
you can't even hold onto it all.

1373
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:19,451
It's just too much.

1374
00:40:19,451 --> 00:40:20,270
It's common,

1375
00:40:20,270 --> 00:40:22,030
it's just too much going on right now.

1376
00:40:22,031 --> 00:40:23,740
And you look at like the scientific,

1377
00:40:23,890 --> 00:40:27,940
just just on the side of just a astronomy,

1378
00:40:27,970 --> 00:40:31,210
just the new discoveries that they're
showing every day where they just found a

1379
00:40:31,211 --> 00:40:34,210
new planets floating in the
middle of nowhere with no galaxy.

1380
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,530
It's just floating around.

1381
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:36,101
They're like,

1382
00:40:36,101 --> 00:40:36,431
shit,

1383
00:40:36,431 --> 00:40:37,930
this planet doesn't even
to have a solar system.

1384
00:40:37,930 --> 00:40:39,790
It's just fucking flying
through the universe.

1385
00:40:40,090 --> 00:40:44,470
There's all kinds of stuff that could
fill your day every day with information

1386
00:40:44,471 --> 00:40:47,320
and so more than a teacher.

1387
00:40:47,321 --> 00:40:49,180
What I'm as is like a portal.

1388
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:50,560
I'm a portal like,

1389
00:40:50,561 --> 00:40:51,010
um,

1390
00:40:51,010 --> 00:40:52,150
I'm out there looking for it,

1391
00:40:52,151 --> 00:40:53,080
but it's not me.

1392
00:40:53,081 --> 00:40:54,640
It's me going,

1393
00:40:54,641 --> 00:40:54,911
hey,

1394
00:40:54,911 --> 00:40:55,131
look,

1395
00:40:55,131 --> 00:40:56,320
did you see that whole it's shit.

1396
00:40:56,321 --> 00:40:57,190
And then somebody else goes,

1397
00:40:57,191 --> 00:40:57,701
do you see that?

1398
00:40:57,701 --> 00:40:57,971
And I go,

1399
00:40:57,971 --> 00:40:58,750
fuck.

1400
00:40:58,750 --> 00:40:59,021
You know,

1401
00:40:59,021 --> 00:40:59,890
it's theirs.

1402
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,120
It's a portal thing.

1403
00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:01,480
It's,

1404
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:04,420
and having a voice like having a podcast,

1405
00:41:04,690 --> 00:41:09,220
it allows people to all like sink in
and your fascination with what you

1406
00:41:09,221 --> 00:41:12,850
described is key because that enthusiasm
that you bring to this is really

1407
00:41:12,851 --> 00:41:13,360
important.

1408
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:16,660
There's so many people who are no longer
enthusiastic about anything in the

1409
00:41:16,661 --> 00:41:16,991
world,

1410
00:41:16,991 --> 00:41:20,080
does no longer hold wonder
and awe and fascination.

1411
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:20,980
How's that possible?

1412
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:24,730
Where are their socks?

1413
00:41:25,270 --> 00:41:26,103
One sock on,

1414
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:27,430
they just get numb.

1415
00:41:27,431 --> 00:41:27,641
You know,

1416
00:41:27,641 --> 00:41:28,840
you get numb by the world.

1417
00:41:28,841 --> 00:41:30,370
You could look at the world as this dark,

1418
00:41:30,371 --> 00:41:34,130
great place and it kind of beats
on him and he just him down until

1419
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:35,420
they can't see that anymore.

1420
00:41:35,421 --> 00:41:36,380
And then you know,

1421
00:41:36,381 --> 00:41:38,030
seeing that in someone that they,

1422
00:41:38,270 --> 00:41:39,200
that they look up to like,

1423
00:41:39,201 --> 00:41:39,770
whoa,

1424
00:41:39,770 --> 00:41:41,300
Joe is really fascinated by this.

1425
00:41:41,301 --> 00:41:45,500
Maybe I think you can kind of inspire
that back in there and you keep that going

1426
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:46,760
just from your natural self.

1427
00:41:46,761 --> 00:41:47,720
But you also work,

1428
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:48,171
you know,

1429
00:41:48,171 --> 00:41:49,130
you work at it too.

1430
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:50,060
If your meditation,

1431
00:41:50,061 --> 00:41:50,900
your flotation,

1432
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:54,980
different things to kind of peel off the
weights that can kind of hold you down

1433
00:41:54,981 --> 00:41:56,080
and keep those perceptions there.

1434
00:41:56,090 --> 00:41:57,620
Keep that fascination alive.

1435
00:41:57,950 --> 00:41:58,970
Now you never win.

1436
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:00,073
You never win.

1437
00:42:00,230 --> 00:42:01,190
It's a swim.

1438
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:01,911
It's not a,

1439
00:42:01,911 --> 00:42:02,350
you know,

1440
00:42:02,350 --> 00:42:03,183
it's not a climb.

1441
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:05,630
You don't get to the top of the
mountain and plant the flag.

1442
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:06,030
No,

1443
00:42:06,030 --> 00:42:08,120
you keep your head above water
and you keep moving bitch.

1444
00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:09,201
And you have to,

1445
00:42:09,201 --> 00:42:09,981
because if you stop,

1446
00:42:09,981 --> 00:42:10,730
you're gonna drown.

1447
00:42:10,730 --> 00:42:11,690
And that's just a fact.

1448
00:42:11,691 --> 00:42:12,421
No matter who you are.

1449
00:42:12,421 --> 00:42:13,340
And no matter what you do,

1450
00:42:13,550 --> 00:42:14,470
if you stop work,

1451
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:15,201
not everything,

1452
00:42:15,201 --> 00:42:19,340
if you stop being aware that
you stopped being like present,

1453
00:42:19,610 --> 00:42:21,230
it'll all go away and
you'll be a shithead.

1454
00:42:21,231 --> 00:42:22,064
Again.

1455
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:24,770
I think.

1456
00:42:24,770 --> 00:42:25,610
I think we all,

1457
00:42:25,611 --> 00:42:26,000
uh,

1458
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,500
we all battle with,

1459
00:42:27,501 --> 00:42:27,880
uh,

1460
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:28,640
you know,

1461
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:30,020
finding our optimum self.

1462
00:42:30,350 --> 00:42:30,711
And,

1463
00:42:30,711 --> 00:42:30,940
uh,

1464
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:32,210
I think for me,

1465
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:32,840
um,

1466
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:34,280
having things like the podcast,

1467
00:42:34,281 --> 00:42:37,040
having things like stand up comedy
heavy things like martial arts,

1468
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:42,220
they've all been these avenues where I
can figure out how to channel my energy

1469
00:42:42,950 --> 00:42:44,510
to be my optimum self.

1470
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:45,291
If there's a,

1471
00:42:45,291 --> 00:42:45,800
um,

1472
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:48,440
a quote that I read
when I was a young boy,

1473
00:42:48,441 --> 00:42:49,670
when I was doing taekwondo,

1474
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:52,430
cause they had like a little
pamphlet they gave out the school.

1475
00:42:52,431 --> 00:42:53,870
I got really lucky and I went to this,

1476
00:42:53,871 --> 00:42:54,350
uh,

1477
00:42:54,350 --> 00:42:56,480
Jay Kim Taekwondo Institute in Boston,

1478
00:42:56,481 --> 00:42:59,990
which is like one of the best
taekwondo schools nationwide ever.

1479
00:43:00,350 --> 00:43:03,890
It was a really amazing school
cause this one guy who was,

1480
00:43:03,891 --> 00:43:04,230
uh,

1481
00:43:04,230 --> 00:43:04,600
the,

1482
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:05,690
the main instructor,

1483
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:07,970
he was this brilliant guy,

1484
00:43:07,971 --> 00:43:08,511
Jay Hahn,

1485
00:43:08,511 --> 00:43:09,260
Kim.

1486
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:10,040
And uh,

1487
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:11,300
that's where I got my black belt from.

1488
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:11,991
And He,

1489
00:43:11,991 --> 00:43:12,800
um,

1490
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:13,930
he had a,

1491
00:43:14,030 --> 00:43:18,830
he was a brilliant guy at several
degrees outside of being a martial arts

1492
00:43:18,831 --> 00:43:19,131
instructor.

1493
00:43:19,131 --> 00:43:22,040
He went to Harvard and graduated from
Harvard Business School was like super

1494
00:43:22,041 --> 00:43:22,874
smart dude,

1495
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:24,410
incredible hard worker,

1496
00:43:24,411 --> 00:43:27,530
but he broke down martial arts in this,

1497
00:43:27,590 --> 00:43:29,360
this pamphlet that they would hand out.

1498
00:43:29,361 --> 00:43:30,410
I'll never forget reading it.

1499
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:35,680
It said that martial arts are a vehicle
for developing your human potential.

1500
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:40,220
And that stuck in my head when I
was like 14 or 15 whenever I was.

1501
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:42,740
And I've carried that
with me my whole life,

1502
00:43:42,741 --> 00:43:43,574
that quote,

1503
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:44,780
because that's what it is.

1504
00:43:44,930 --> 00:43:49,460
It's something you can plug yourself into
to find out what you're capable of and

1505
00:43:49,461 --> 00:43:52,100
to find out how to optimally be yourself

1506
00:43:53,010 --> 00:43:57,150
and to do battle with your own
resistance on a microcosmic level,

1507
00:43:57,180 --> 00:43:57,520
you know,

1508
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:58,440
and this small,

1509
00:43:58,530 --> 00:44:01,710
you're going to have so
many things weighing on you
that the day before a match,

1510
00:44:01,711 --> 00:44:05,880
all these different voices and doubts
and superstitions and fears and things

1511
00:44:05,881 --> 00:44:08,580
that you can battle and try
to overcome so that when,

1512
00:44:08,670 --> 00:44:10,230
when it really matters in life,

1513
00:44:10,231 --> 00:44:12,120
you get these bigger challenges ahead.

1514
00:44:12,270 --> 00:44:13,350
You got practice,

1515
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:13,890
you know,

1516
00:44:13,890 --> 00:44:14,890
you know how to defeat it.

1517
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:15,180
He's like,

1518
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:15,331
Oh,

1519
00:44:15,331 --> 00:44:18,840
I've seen that old photo and
I slayed him a hundred times.

1520
00:44:19,430 --> 00:44:20,990
What's great about something like that,

1521
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:22,370
I think like martial arts is,

1522
00:44:22,371 --> 00:44:22,850
it's just,

1523
00:44:22,850 --> 00:44:23,900
it's a structure.

1524
00:44:23,990 --> 00:44:28,910
It's an entire culture that has a rules,

1525
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:29,960
rituals,

1526
00:44:30,410 --> 00:44:31,243
orders,

1527
00:44:31,410 --> 00:44:36,410
and a young man or a boy comes into
that with just this amorphous energy

1528
00:44:37,381 --> 00:44:38,610
exploding out of is a year,

1529
00:44:38,870 --> 00:44:42,690
his eyeballs and everything and
suddenly he's given a structure.

1530
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:44,250
This is how you learn.

1531
00:44:44,430 --> 00:44:45,540
You start here,

1532
00:44:45,690 --> 00:44:47,520
learn to do this one move,

1533
00:44:47,521 --> 00:44:47,910
and then when,

1534
00:44:47,910 --> 00:44:51,750
when you've learned that I'll teach you
the next move and it kind of channels

1535
00:44:51,751 --> 00:44:52,321
everything.

1536
00:44:52,321 --> 00:44:56,040
And I think we don't get
that in society these days.

1537
00:44:56,041 --> 00:44:58,020
Certainly young men don't get that.

1538
00:44:58,050 --> 00:44:58,620
You know,

1539
00:44:58,620 --> 00:44:59,431
you go to school,

1540
00:44:59,431 --> 00:45:01,890
it's basically a kind of
a feminized environment,

1541
00:45:02,010 --> 00:45:02,370
right?

1542
00:45:02,370 --> 00:45:04,950
Other than the football
team or whatever that is,

1543
00:45:04,951 --> 00:45:06,090
which is again,

1544
00:45:06,330 --> 00:45:09,480
a structure and that's again,

1545
00:45:09,481 --> 00:45:10,740
that's why people join the army.

1546
00:45:10,741 --> 00:45:14,670
I think because they're young guys because
they're desperate for some kind of a,

1547
00:45:14,850 --> 00:45:19,170
some kind of a way to channel that into
something that means something that kind

1548
00:45:19,171 --> 00:45:19,890
of,

1549
00:45:19,890 --> 00:45:20,723
uh,

1550
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:22,950
provide significance to something.

1551
00:45:23,510 --> 00:45:25,250
And I think like it or not.

1552
00:45:25,630 --> 00:45:26,630
And most people,

1553
00:45:26,631 --> 00:45:27,464
I would say not,

1554
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:29,090
we have caveman DNA.

1555
00:45:29,330 --> 00:45:29,601
I mean,

1556
00:45:29,601 --> 00:45:31,190
it's just in our system period.

1557
00:45:31,250 --> 00:45:32,030
Absolutely.

1558
00:45:32,030 --> 00:45:37,030
You either accept that and manage it
or you deny it and go fucking crazy and

1559
00:45:37,041 --> 00:45:40,340
traffic and wonder why you're screaming
and sticking your finger at somebody

1560
00:45:40,550 --> 00:45:42,110
because their car got
in front of your car.

1561
00:45:42,111 --> 00:45:42,621
Like you,

1562
00:45:42,621 --> 00:45:46,580
you find yourself loft
lost in the wave of rage.

1563
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:47,960
That's possible too.

1564
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:48,913
I've seen ice,

1565
00:45:49,130 --> 00:45:53,960
I saw this woman screaming at some
woman or some sort of a traffic thing,

1566
00:45:53,961 --> 00:45:54,560
just going,

1567
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:58,420
I'll never forget her
face going to fuck it.

1568
00:45:58,421 --> 00:45:58,910
I Dunno.

1569
00:45:58,910 --> 00:45:59,743
I Dunno what,

1570
00:45:59,870 --> 00:46:01,010
I don't know what happened.

1571
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:01,820
I mean,

1572
00:46:01,820 --> 00:46:06,820
we've all see that usually can blind
when you're just zero and you see that

1573
00:46:07,101 --> 00:46:07,970
blind rage.

1574
00:46:07,971 --> 00:46:08,804
It's,

1575
00:46:09,030 --> 00:46:10,290
here's the other side of that,

1576
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:10,990
at least what I was,

1577
00:46:10,990 --> 00:46:12,030
I was just saying about,

1578
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:12,893
um,

1579
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:17,580
a structured thing like learning martial
arts is something that an individual

1580
00:46:17,581 --> 00:46:18,570
can join.

1581
00:46:18,890 --> 00:46:23,130
And there are others who are also students
and there's a teacher who's teaching

1582
00:46:23,131 --> 00:46:24,180
them and telling them what to do.

1583
00:46:24,540 --> 00:46:29,540
But the other side of that is art is
trying to produce whatever it is you're

1584
00:46:31,051 --> 00:46:31,800
trying to produce.

1585
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:32,640
A movie,

1586
00:46:32,950 --> 00:46:34,320
a painting,

1587
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:35,850
a book or something like that.

1588
00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:37,410
This is where,

1589
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:38,520
at least in my opinion,

1590
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:44,300
you go as an individual and where there
are no rules and where or there are

1591
00:46:45,271 --> 00:46:45,661
rules,

1592
00:46:45,661 --> 00:46:46,960
but you have to discover them,

1593
00:46:46,961 --> 00:46:47,940
them yourself.

1594
00:46:48,330 --> 00:46:52,500
And so this is what we're talking about
before about entering into another

1595
00:46:52,501 --> 00:46:55,740
dimension of reality or tapping
into another dimension of reality,

1596
00:46:56,010 --> 00:46:56,843
which is not,

1597
00:46:57,300 --> 00:46:59,970
which is the dimension of potentiality.

1598
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:04,920
It's like this podcast existed
before you and Brian put it together.

1599
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:09,360
It just existed on another level
and potentiality and on it.

1600
00:47:09,361 --> 00:47:12,630
And the stuff that you guys
do that also existed and,

1601
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:15,990
or a book that I might write or
a movie that somebody might do.

1602
00:47:16,290 --> 00:47:19,380
And so I think that is a kind of a,

1603
00:47:19,381 --> 00:47:22,590
without trying to sound
too phony baloney here,

1604
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:24,870
it's a warrior pursuit.

1605
00:47:25,020 --> 00:47:30,020
It's something that taps into that wolf
energy or that pure testosterone energy

1606
00:47:32,530 --> 00:47:33,041
only.

1607
00:47:33,041 --> 00:47:38,020
It's not channeled in a
path that already exists.

1608
00:47:38,380 --> 00:47:38,891
You,

1609
00:47:38,891 --> 00:47:41,290
the artist or the comedian or whatever,

1610
00:47:41,770 --> 00:47:46,770
discover that path one footstep at a time
and you sort of put your foot out and

1611
00:47:47,141 --> 00:47:48,130
you go wrong.

1612
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:51,790
You go into a puddle or you step
on a pungy stakers and then you go,

1613
00:47:51,970 --> 00:47:52,541
well shit,

1614
00:47:52,541 --> 00:47:53,710
wait a minute over here.

1615
00:47:53,890 --> 00:47:55,860
This is solid ground and you,

1616
00:47:55,861 --> 00:47:56,694
you know this guy,

1617
00:47:56,710 --> 00:47:57,850
this got a laugh.

1618
00:47:57,970 --> 00:48:00,460
This made people I killed when I did this.

1619
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:01,293
Right?

1620
00:48:01,330 --> 00:48:05,680
And so you are kind of in the dark,

1621
00:48:05,681 --> 00:48:07,450
like somebody's moving through the dark,

1622
00:48:07,780 --> 00:48:08,980
trusting your instincts,

1623
00:48:08,981 --> 00:48:11,350
trusting whatever little
star light you can see.

1624
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:13,210
And when you finally get to the,

1625
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:14,360
to the end of that far,

1626
00:48:14,361 --> 00:48:15,110
so you turn around,

1627
00:48:15,110 --> 00:48:18,790
you look back at the path you
took for a writer that's a book.

1628
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,170
And you look down and you say,

1629
00:48:20,171 --> 00:48:21,460
where the fuck did that come from?

1630
00:48:21,630 --> 00:48:22,270
You know,

1631
00:48:22,270 --> 00:48:23,103
and,

1632
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:27,580
and you realize that
that was you all along,

1633
00:48:28,270 --> 00:48:32,710
but you had no idea when you started to
discover reading that Jackson Brown says

1634
00:48:32,711 --> 00:48:36,970
that he writes a song to figure
out what he thinks about something.

1635
00:48:37,460 --> 00:48:37,581
Yeah,

1636
00:48:37,581 --> 00:48:40,760
but he had sex with Linda
Ronstadt right back in the day.

1637
00:48:41,060 --> 00:48:41,930
He was a stud.

1638
00:48:42,110 --> 00:48:42,501
That guy,

1639
00:48:42,501 --> 00:48:42,840
you know,

1640
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:43,690
only at John Merrill.

1641
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:44,391
What's wrong with it?

1642
00:48:44,391 --> 00:48:46,150
That's very studly thing to do very stuff.

1643
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:50,240
Find out what you want to do is have
regular dude singing those beautiful songs

1644
00:48:50,241 --> 00:48:51,320
up there on that stage.

1645
00:48:52,250 --> 00:48:53,330
So anyway,

1646
00:48:53,390 --> 00:48:54,440
that's the way by magic.

1647
00:48:55,050 --> 00:48:55,883
I,

1648
00:48:57,340 --> 00:48:58,700
you know,

1649
00:48:58,701 --> 00:48:59,240
I think,

1650
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:02,690
I think what you're saying is also like
what Michelangelo said about creating

1651
00:49:02,691 --> 00:49:05,600
sculpture is that he removes the,

1652
00:49:05,630 --> 00:49:07,520
he finds the sculpture in the thing.

1653
00:49:07,521 --> 00:49:08,630
It's not like he makes it,

1654
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:11,120
he removes all the stuff
that's hiding the sculpture.

1655
00:49:11,810 --> 00:49:13,100
That's how he looked at it.

1656
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:13,521
You know,

1657
00:49:13,521 --> 00:49:17,270
I think so many people that I get
questions that they don't know what to do,

1658
00:49:17,330 --> 00:49:17,630
you know,

1659
00:49:17,630 --> 00:49:18,890
they're just trying to figure it out.

1660
00:49:18,891 --> 00:49:20,600
And then I always give
him the same advice.

1661
00:49:20,601 --> 00:49:21,240
I say,

1662
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:21,470
you know,

1663
00:49:21,470 --> 00:49:23,990
practice being excellent
at something you love.

1664
00:49:24,110 --> 00:49:25,070
It could be trivial,

1665
00:49:25,071 --> 00:49:26,210
it could be darts.

1666
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:26,931
I don't care.

1667
00:49:26,931 --> 00:49:27,860
Whatever it is,

1668
00:49:27,950 --> 00:49:30,260
just be excellent at
it puts yourself into,

1669
00:49:30,261 --> 00:49:31,190
I think you're right.

1670
00:49:31,191 --> 00:49:33,890
On time you'll discover you'll
discover something about yourself,

1671
00:49:33,891 --> 00:49:34,491
whatever it is.

1672
00:49:34,491 --> 00:49:34,671
You know,

1673
00:49:34,671 --> 00:49:35,504
a lot of people were,

1674
00:49:35,510 --> 00:49:35,811
you know,

1675
00:49:35,811 --> 00:49:38,420
we'll look to me to see
if they can get a job.

1676
00:49:38,421 --> 00:49:39,800
And my question is always the same.

1677
00:49:40,010 --> 00:49:41,450
What are you excellent at?

1678
00:49:41,660 --> 00:49:44,750
Because if they can show me two random
things that they are incredible at,

1679
00:49:44,751 --> 00:49:45,584
they're excellent at,

1680
00:49:45,650 --> 00:49:49,250
I know that they've learned to apply
their authentic self because you can't

1681
00:49:49,251 --> 00:49:53,440
truly be excellent at anything
without tapping into that or

1682
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:55,920
did that adolescent just what do you love?

1683
00:49:56,010 --> 00:49:56,430
Yeah.

1684
00:49:56,430 --> 00:49:57,810
What makes you happy?

1685
00:49:58,060 --> 00:49:58,893
What's Fund?

1686
00:49:58,980 --> 00:49:59,101
Well,

1687
00:49:59,101 --> 00:50:00,960
that's the Great William
Moulton Musashi quote.

1688
00:50:01,230 --> 00:50:02,730
Once you understand the way broadly,

1689
00:50:02,731 --> 00:50:03,840
you can see it in all things.

1690
00:50:03,841 --> 00:50:04,390
Exactly.

1691
00:50:04,390 --> 00:50:04,620
That,

1692
00:50:04,620 --> 00:50:09,210
that idea that there's something that
you tap into and it manifests itself in a

1693
00:50:09,211 --> 00:50:11,550
number of different ways
and athletics and artistic,

1694
00:50:12,060 --> 00:50:12,990
but whatever it is,

1695
00:50:13,370 --> 00:50:15,990
but what you're doing is you're
tapping into the same thing.

1696
00:50:15,991 --> 00:50:17,010
And that is excellent.

1697
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:19,230
You're tapping into
the real thing the way,

1698
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:20,500
and then when you're on the path,

1699
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:21,353
it's going to give you,

1700
00:50:21,390 --> 00:50:21,660
you know,

1701
00:50:21,660 --> 00:50:22,890
the fruits of your destiny,

1702
00:50:22,891 --> 00:50:23,491
so to speak.

1703
00:50:23,491 --> 00:50:24,121
Whatever it is,

1704
00:50:24,121 --> 00:50:27,030
that's that channel that's going to
bring you to the ultimate higher.

1705
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:29,180
You already have practice being excellent,

1706
00:50:29,181 --> 00:50:29,391
you know,

1707
00:50:29,391 --> 00:50:30,650
you know how to do the work.

1708
00:50:30,890 --> 00:50:32,990
And that's another key
thing that I love about,

1709
00:50:33,110 --> 00:50:34,550
that you always go back to is just,

1710
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:35,031
you know,

1711
00:50:35,031 --> 00:50:35,781
how to do the work.

1712
00:50:35,781 --> 00:50:39,350
You knew how to take the initial steps
that one foot in front of the other to

1713
00:50:39,351 --> 00:50:42,470
get there and to see progress and
to apply yourself in that way.

1714
00:50:43,070 --> 00:50:43,510
Yeah,

1715
00:50:43,510 --> 00:50:47,270
I'm definitely a believer in
just doing the mundane thing,

1716
00:50:47,870 --> 00:50:48,703
you know,

1717
00:50:48,740 --> 00:50:50,030
walk into the room,

1718
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:53,900
sit down at the keyboard
or walk into the Dojo,

1719
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:56,420
start to do whatever the first thing is.

1720
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:57,890
Um,

1721
00:50:57,890 --> 00:50:58,790
it's the same thing.

1722
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:00,793
Yeah.

1723
00:51:01,670 --> 00:51:02,503
But I would,

1724
00:51:02,570 --> 00:51:02,770
you know,

1725
00:51:02,770 --> 00:51:05,210
just something is occurring
to me as we're talking here.

1726
00:51:05,450 --> 00:51:06,283
I might be,

1727
00:51:06,410 --> 00:51:08,090
I haven't even thought about
this in a million years,

1728
00:51:08,091 --> 00:51:09,740
but you were talking about Aubrey,

1729
00:51:09,741 --> 00:51:13,660
about people that don't
seem to care or don't have,

1730
00:51:13,690 --> 00:51:14,523
uh,

1731
00:51:14,540 --> 00:51:14,931
the,

1732
00:51:14,931 --> 00:51:15,080
uh,

1733
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:17,050
enthusiasm for Sunday and all in one.

1734
00:51:17,060 --> 00:51:17,810
Yeah,

1735
00:51:17,810 --> 00:51:18,680
I can remember that.

1736
00:51:18,710 --> 00:51:19,461
I used to be,

1737
00:51:19,461 --> 00:51:20,001
for years,

1738
00:51:20,001 --> 00:51:23,030
I struggled like that where
I was bored with things.

1739
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:25,250
I was bored with myself.

1740
00:51:25,700 --> 00:51:28,340
I was beating my brains out saying,

1741
00:51:28,341 --> 00:51:29,570
why don't I love something?

1742
00:51:29,571 --> 00:51:29,931
What,

1743
00:51:29,931 --> 00:51:30,171
what's,

1744
00:51:30,171 --> 00:51:31,004
what is missing?

1745
00:51:31,430 --> 00:51:31,790
And I,

1746
00:51:31,790 --> 00:51:32,511
my sort of,

1747
00:51:32,511 --> 00:51:37,511
my conclusion was that I really did
have tremendous ambition and tremendous

1748
00:51:40,371 --> 00:51:41,270
aspiration,

1749
00:51:41,570 --> 00:51:44,780
but I had buried it under layers of fear.

1750
00:51:45,110 --> 00:51:45,710
You know,

1751
00:51:45,710 --> 00:51:46,111
as if,

1752
00:51:46,111 --> 00:51:50,870
if I would ever admit to myself that
I wanted to be excellent at something,

1753
00:51:51,170 --> 00:51:53,030
that that would be more than I could,

1754
00:51:53,270 --> 00:51:55,640
I could take failure would
be more than I could take.

1755
00:51:56,030 --> 00:52:00,020
And so when I finally sort
of admitted to myself,

1756
00:52:00,021 --> 00:52:01,420
and actually it's in the authentic swing,

1757
00:52:01,450 --> 00:52:01,761
I think,

1758
00:52:01,761 --> 00:52:02,594
or maybe some,

1759
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:05,960
but when I admitted to myself
that I did have ambition,

1760
00:52:06,050 --> 00:52:07,580
I did want to do something,

1761
00:52:08,390 --> 00:52:10,700
suddenly everything changed.

1762
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,280
And then enthusiasm did come.

1763
00:52:13,281 --> 00:52:14,510
But it was fear.

1764
00:52:15,050 --> 00:52:16,340
So I th I think when we,

1765
00:52:16,910 --> 00:52:19,940
when we're running into
people that are not,

1766
00:52:19,941 --> 00:52:20,900
don't have enthusiasm,

1767
00:52:20,901 --> 00:52:21,860
don't have that fire,

1768
00:52:22,820 --> 00:52:24,110
I don't believe it's not there.

1769
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:25,730
I think it's buried under fear.

1770
00:52:26,210 --> 00:52:26,901
And I think,

1771
00:52:26,901 --> 00:52:27,420
uh,

1772
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:29,270
I think that's why great teachers,

1773
00:52:29,690 --> 00:52:34,690
coaches will put a young person
in a position where they can,

1774
00:52:34,940 --> 00:52:38,450
they can exceed their expectations or
their belief about themselves where they

1775
00:52:38,451 --> 00:52:41,720
thought they couldn't do it and then the
guy kicks him in the ass enough time,

1776
00:52:41,721 --> 00:52:42,860
they actually do it and they go,

1777
00:52:42,861 --> 00:52:43,341
wow,

1778
00:52:43,341 --> 00:52:44,151
how did that happen?

1779
00:52:44,151 --> 00:52:44,720
You know?

1780
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:49,720
And then that's the spark that
can then burst into flame if it's,

1781
00:52:49,850 --> 00:52:51,200
if it's guided properly.

1782
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:52,550
And I see,

1783
00:52:52,551 --> 00:52:53,450
I see that everywhere.

1784
00:52:53,451 --> 00:52:54,440
I'm sorry to say,

1785
00:52:54,441 --> 00:52:54,711
you know,

1786
00:52:54,711 --> 00:52:55,760
in this country it's everywhere.

1787
00:52:55,950 --> 00:52:56,101
Well,

1788
00:52:56,101 --> 00:53:00,030
I'm glad that you brought up that
it was you at one point and you,

1789
00:53:00,060 --> 00:53:04,080
you passed it because one of the really
important things about your book I think

1790
00:53:04,081 --> 00:53:04,740
is that you,

1791
00:53:04,740 --> 00:53:07,200
you're really objective assessment,

1792
00:53:07,201 --> 00:53:08,580
assessment of your own life.

1793
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:11,400
At one point in time when
you were like 40 years old,

1794
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:12,001
you know,

1795
00:53:12,001 --> 00:53:14,400
you were talking about
this was a long time ago.

1796
00:53:14,430 --> 00:53:14,641
Yeah.

1797
00:53:14,641 --> 00:53:17,700
This script that wasn't
working and you know,

1798
00:53:17,790 --> 00:53:18,121
you know,

1799
00:53:18,121 --> 00:53:18,361
you know,

1800
00:53:18,361 --> 00:53:18,781
you were like,

1801
00:53:18,781 --> 00:53:19,800
what the fuck am I doing?

1802
00:53:19,801 --> 00:53:24,660
And then how did you go from that to
completely getting it together enough to

1803
00:53:24,661 --> 00:53:25,950
write books about

1804
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:26,730
getting it together?

1805
00:53:26,730 --> 00:53:28,320
How did you get over that fear?

1806
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:30,770
Uh,

1807
00:53:31,550 --> 00:53:34,810
I think at that time you'd be the
fear that I was just talking about.

1808
00:53:34,811 --> 00:53:35,000
Yeah.

1809
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:35,631
Well the same thing.

1810
00:53:35,631 --> 00:53:36,140
Same question.

1811
00:53:36,140 --> 00:53:36,973
How did you,

1812
00:53:37,210 --> 00:53:38,120
how did you figure it out?

1813
00:53:38,270 --> 00:53:42,920
I think once I realized that I,

1814
00:53:42,921 --> 00:53:45,920
that there was something I wanted
that I wanted to be a writer,

1815
00:53:46,340 --> 00:53:50,750
which I had refused to admit to myself
cause I was so afraid of failing.

1816
00:53:50,751 --> 00:53:53,150
And then I just sort of said,

1817
00:53:53,151 --> 00:53:53,984
well,

1818
00:53:53,990 --> 00:53:54,201
you know,

1819
00:53:54,201 --> 00:53:54,951
there was a moment,

1820
00:53:54,951 --> 00:53:59,951
it's actually in the war of art where
I just sort of realized the way you get

1821
00:54:00,021 --> 00:54:02,120
there is one step at a time.

1822
00:54:02,750 --> 00:54:03,470
You know,

1823
00:54:03,470 --> 00:54:04,640
like an alcoholic,

1824
00:54:05,060 --> 00:54:05,481
you know,

1825
00:54:05,481 --> 00:54:05,781
one,

1826
00:54:05,781 --> 00:54:08,600
one day at a time and that it was a,

1827
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:09,770
uh,

1828
00:54:09,770 --> 00:54:13,220
a process that could be demystified.

1829
00:54:13,580 --> 00:54:16,430
It wasn't airy fairy
waiting for inspiration.

1830
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:18,320
It was just sit the fuck down,

1831
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:21,470
put a piece of paper and
a typewriter and start,

1832
00:54:21,740 --> 00:54:22,101
you know,

1833
00:54:22,101 --> 00:54:24,440
and then do that the next
day and do it the next day.

1834
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:26,240
And when,

1835
00:54:26,390 --> 00:54:31,390
and the other aspect for me was I had no
choice that anytime I would try to stop

1836
00:54:33,860 --> 00:54:35,210
and try to sell out,

1837
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:37,940
I was like so depressed that I that.

1838
00:54:37,941 --> 00:54:40,190
So I just had no choice
to just keep going,

1839
00:54:40,191 --> 00:54:40,551
going,

1840
00:54:40,551 --> 00:54:40,950
going.

1841
00:54:40,950 --> 00:54:43,940
But it was before I wrote the
war of art I probably been in,

1842
00:54:43,941 --> 00:54:47,420
had been writing for at least 30
years or at least trying to do that.

1843
00:54:47,750 --> 00:54:52,750
That book came out in about two months
just because it was so clear in my mind

1844
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:56,640
that that's what I had been fighting all,

1845
00:54:56,650 --> 00:54:57,470
all these years.

1846
00:54:57,470 --> 00:55:01,150
Did you find that putting
it down on paper helped you?

1847
00:55:01,450 --> 00:55:04,870
Very much because it became very
clear to me like a law most,

1848
00:55:04,900 --> 00:55:05,560
yeah.

1849
00:55:05,560 --> 00:55:06,730
I mean for me,

1850
00:55:06,731 --> 00:55:07,001
you know,

1851
00:55:07,001 --> 00:55:11,740
it's like the way the war of art
kind of started for me was that a,

1852
00:55:11,741 --> 00:55:13,150
and I'm sure you guys get this too,

1853
00:55:13,151 --> 00:55:17,080
it's like friends will come to you and
they see that you're getting it to get,

1854
00:55:17,081 --> 00:55:17,920
you're doing something,

1855
00:55:17,921 --> 00:55:18,071
you know,

1856
00:55:18,071 --> 00:55:18,640
and they'll say,

1857
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:18,911
you know,

1858
00:55:18,911 --> 00:55:19,744
I've got a,

1859
00:55:20,380 --> 00:55:23,800
I've got a business in me or
a book in me or a movie in me.

1860
00:55:24,100 --> 00:55:27,250
And I found myself
sitting up with friends,

1861
00:55:27,251 --> 00:55:28,300
you don't till two in the morning,

1862
00:55:28,301 --> 00:55:30,750
kind of psyching them up saying,

1863
00:55:30,751 --> 00:55:30,881
you know,

1864
00:55:30,881 --> 00:55:31,571
you can do it.

1865
00:55:31,571 --> 00:55:32,200
You know,

1866
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:36,250
and explaining what the negative force
was of resistance and how it was all

1867
00:55:36,251 --> 00:55:36,731
bullshit.

1868
00:55:36,731 --> 00:55:37,750
It was all in your mind,

1869
00:55:37,990 --> 00:55:38,801
you could overcome it,

1870
00:55:38,801 --> 00:55:38,941
blah,

1871
00:55:38,941 --> 00:55:39,151
blah,

1872
00:55:39,151 --> 00:55:39,341
blah,

1873
00:55:39,341 --> 00:55:39,521
blah.

1874
00:55:39,521 --> 00:55:41,230
And after doing that about 10 times,

1875
00:55:41,231 --> 00:55:42,850
and of course nobody listens to you.

1876
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:46,720
Finally I just said I had like a
two month break and I just said,

1877
00:55:46,721 --> 00:55:48,670
I'm gonna write this down on paper.

1878
00:55:48,700 --> 00:55:49,870
And then when somebody comes to me,

1879
00:55:49,871 --> 00:55:50,231
I'll just say,

1880
00:55:50,231 --> 00:55:50,471
here,

1881
00:55:50,471 --> 00:55:52,090
read this and you know,

1882
00:55:52,091 --> 00:55:52,690
shut up.

1883
00:55:52,690 --> 00:55:53,440
You know?

1884
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:56,440
So that's sort of how that came out.

1885
00:55:56,441 --> 00:56:01,441
But it was very clear in my mind from
experiencing it and talking about it for

1886
00:56:01,751 --> 00:56:02,584
years.

1887
00:56:03,340 --> 00:56:04,230
I don't know if that answers your

1888
00:56:04,270 --> 00:56:04,481
well.

1889
00:56:04,481 --> 00:56:05,261
I think you're,

1890
00:56:05,261 --> 00:56:08,380
I think you're honest with yourself and
anyone who's honest with themselves,

1891
00:56:08,710 --> 00:56:10,810
after enough information comes in,

1892
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:12,430
that's sort of the
conclusion they all draw.

1893
00:56:12,431 --> 00:56:13,960
Like I'm kind of fucking myself here.

1894
00:56:13,961 --> 00:56:15,070
I'm sabotaging myself.

1895
00:56:15,071 --> 00:56:15,200
Like,

1896
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:16,990
why don't I know what I need to do?

1897
00:56:16,991 --> 00:56:18,310
If I had to give myself advice,

1898
00:56:18,311 --> 00:56:19,270
what advice would I give?

1899
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:20,201
Just do it.

1900
00:56:20,201 --> 00:56:21,400
Bitch gets get working,

1901
00:56:21,401 --> 00:56:21,680
you know,

1902
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:22,660
do what you gotta do.

1903
00:56:22,810 --> 00:56:24,160
I lose the last 10 cows.

1904
00:56:24,460 --> 00:56:25,570
Will you please shut the fuck?

1905
00:56:26,140 --> 00:56:27,250
Cause that's not true.

1906
00:56:27,340 --> 00:56:29,530
If you were in a wheelchair
from the neck down,

1907
00:56:29,531 --> 00:56:30,101
paralyzed,

1908
00:56:30,101 --> 00:56:30,610
you're right,

1909
00:56:30,610 --> 00:56:31,750
you can't lose that and you,

1910
00:56:31,770 --> 00:56:32,411
you're okay,

1911
00:56:32,411 --> 00:56:33,370
that's out of your control.

1912
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:34,900
But that's not what's going on here.

1913
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:35,890
This is weird.

1914
00:56:36,130 --> 00:56:39,100
Like with this thing is a weird little
struggle you've got going on because

1915
00:56:39,101 --> 00:56:40,840
people out there that
are struggling for real.

1916
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:43,840
And I think in the absence of that,

1917
00:56:44,050 --> 00:56:44,261
you know,

1918
00:56:44,261 --> 00:56:45,580
there's something to be said about these,

1919
00:56:45,581 --> 00:56:46,090
um,

1920
00:56:46,090 --> 00:56:49,510
hunter gatherer cultures and the
happiness and the hunter hunter gatherer

1921
00:56:49,511 --> 00:56:50,280
cultures.

1922
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:51,340
Very strange.

1923
00:56:51,460 --> 00:56:54,610
It's like almost devoid of insanity.

1924
00:56:54,820 --> 00:56:55,780
Almost a,

1925
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:59,440
we just almost completely cured of,

1926
00:56:59,441 --> 00:56:59,680
uh,

1927
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:00,760
mental health issues.

1928
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:01,960
It's really weird.

1929
00:57:02,170 --> 00:57:05,980
They have alcoholism if alcohol is
introduced into their environments.

1930
00:57:06,250 --> 00:57:07,150
But other than that,

1931
00:57:07,151 --> 00:57:08,200
when they don't have that,

1932
00:57:08,410 --> 00:57:10,460
like happy people life in the taiga.

1933
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:12,070
Did you ever see that documentary?

1934
00:57:12,550 --> 00:57:16,870
It's a Werner Herzog's documentary on
these people that live in Siberia and all

1935
00:57:16,871 --> 00:57:18,760
these guys do is live off the land.

1936
00:57:18,820 --> 00:57:22,640
All they do is hunt and
fish and trap and you know,

1937
00:57:22,670 --> 00:57:27,550
they trapping furs and that's how they
buy like snowmobiles and hatchets and

1938
00:57:27,551 --> 00:57:28,241
shit like that.

1939
00:57:28,241 --> 00:57:28,620
But the,

1940
00:57:28,620 --> 00:57:31,090
the majority of their time
is just shooting animals,

1941
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:31,661
eating them,

1942
00:57:31,661 --> 00:57:34,480
fishing and everybody's happy as fuck.

1943
00:57:34,660 --> 00:57:37,360
There's a whole village of
people that are so happy.

1944
00:57:37,810 --> 00:57:39,700
They're just smiling and laughing.

1945
00:57:39,710 --> 00:57:40,900
There's like no disputes.

1946
00:57:40,901 --> 00:57:42,760
Everybody's working
together to try to get meat.

1947
00:57:43,270 --> 00:57:43,451
You know,

1948
00:57:43,451 --> 00:57:44,350
they're showing how to like,

1949
00:57:44,470 --> 00:57:44,881
like the,

1950
00:57:44,881 --> 00:57:49,120
the craftsmanship involved in
making these snow shoes and sleds,

1951
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:50,920
they make their own skis.

1952
00:57:51,130 --> 00:57:51,371
I mean,

1953
00:57:51,371 --> 00:57:52,240
it's really,

1954
00:57:52,241 --> 00:57:57,241
really interesting because in the absence
of that real day to day struggle that

1955
00:57:58,151 --> 00:57:59,620
these people have,

1956
00:57:59,860 --> 00:58:00,910
we're almost like,

1957
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:04,360
we were like waiting for something
to come along and kick us in the ass.

1958
00:58:04,361 --> 00:58:08,560
It's almost like we only react by
nature instead of act in some way.

1959
00:58:08,610 --> 00:58:09,180
Yes.

1960
00:58:09,180 --> 00:58:09,750
Well,

1961
00:58:09,750 --> 00:58:11,880
I'm actually fascinated
by that stuff to joy.

1962
00:58:12,050 --> 00:58:15,540
I've been fascinated by
tribal cultures and uh,

1963
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:17,100
but you know,

1964
00:58:17,580 --> 00:58:19,020
there's no going back to that.

1965
00:58:19,260 --> 00:58:19,940
No,

1966
00:58:19,940 --> 00:58:20,070
no,

1967
00:58:20,070 --> 00:58:20,251
no.

1968
00:58:20,251 --> 00:58:23,640
At some point there was an invention
happened in the invention was the

1969
00:58:23,641 --> 00:58:26,790
individual and once that was invented,

1970
00:58:26,791 --> 00:58:31,140
I think the ancient Greeks invented it
somewhere around the time of Socrates.

1971
00:58:31,141 --> 00:58:31,974
And before that,

1972
00:58:32,460 --> 00:58:37,460
and at that point we no
longer had the tribe.

1973
00:58:38,250 --> 00:58:38,760
You know,

1974
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:40,830
we no longer had that wonderful,

1975
00:58:40,860 --> 00:58:41,400
uh,

1976
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:42,720
thing enveloping us.

1977
00:58:42,910 --> 00:58:43,590
But,

1978
00:58:43,590 --> 00:58:44,423
but the other,

1979
00:58:44,970 --> 00:58:45,151
you know,

1980
00:58:45,151 --> 00:58:45,721
if you also,

1981
00:58:45,721 --> 00:58:46,340
if you look about,

1982
00:58:46,340 --> 00:58:47,460
you look at Afghanistan,

1983
00:58:47,461 --> 00:58:47,641
you know,

1984
00:58:47,641 --> 00:58:51,810
which is a great place for us to study
because we see it in the news that we've

1985
00:58:51,811 --> 00:58:52,644
had seen it,

1986
00:58:52,650 --> 00:58:57,650
which is like in Pashtunistan you get
kind of pretty much tribal culture the way

1987
00:58:58,231 --> 00:58:58,921
it was way,

1988
00:58:58,921 --> 00:58:59,101
way,

1989
00:58:59,101 --> 00:58:59,761
way back when.

1990
00:58:59,761 --> 00:59:02,490
And I'm also like when I was talking
about reading math of command,

1991
00:59:02,491 --> 00:59:03,324
she's a little while ago.

1992
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:04,381
The other thing,

1993
00:59:04,381 --> 00:59:09,381
one of the things about tribes is they
are unbelievably cruel to whoever if they

1994
00:59:10,261 --> 00:59:14,970
capture anybody else or if there's
anyone who violates the tribe,

1995
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:15,690
Eh,

1996
00:59:15,690 --> 00:59:16,081
you know,

1997
00:59:16,081 --> 00:59:19,500
it's not such an idyllic world
when you get into that side.

1998
00:59:19,501 --> 00:59:19,640
Yeah,

1999
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:20,031
wait a minute.

2000
00:59:20,031 --> 00:59:21,290
You mean it's not like avatar

2001
00:59:23,010 --> 00:59:25,710
decide they left out of course.

2002
00:59:26,110 --> 00:59:26,600
But yeah,

2003
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:27,860
it's almost like that's a,

2004
00:59:27,861 --> 00:59:29,840
it's almost a cheat code to happiness.

2005
00:59:29,870 --> 00:59:30,111
You know,

2006
00:59:30,111 --> 00:59:31,910
that kind of simple
life where you're doing,

2007
00:59:31,911 --> 00:59:34,440
you're constantly out there
doing this world where it's,

2008
00:59:34,470 --> 00:59:38,060
it's just we don't know what the hell
to do and we don't have action as this

2009
00:59:38,061 --> 00:59:40,010
kind of through line in our life of,

2010
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:40,461
okay,

2011
00:59:40,461 --> 00:59:42,260
got to go to achieve that next goal,

2012
00:59:42,261 --> 00:59:43,670
which is meet that next goal,

2013
00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:44,301
which is Fitch.

2014
00:59:44,301 --> 00:59:44,931
That next goal,

2015
00:59:44,931 --> 00:59:45,764
which is shelter.

2016
00:59:45,950 --> 00:59:47,600
It's just this amorphous world.

2017
00:59:47,601 --> 00:59:48,710
And we got to figure it out.

2018
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:52,730
And I think one of the things you said
is it was really important is you've got

2019
00:59:52,731 --> 00:59:54,650
to just do the work and then,

2020
00:59:54,651 --> 00:59:56,450
but at the start it's
always a leap of faith,

2021
00:59:56,540 --> 00:59:57,440
whatever that is.

2022
00:59:57,441 --> 01:00:00,110
Like you don't know exactly
how it's gonna turn out,

2023
01:00:00,260 --> 01:00:00,741
but you know,

2024
01:00:00,741 --> 01:00:01,850
you take that first,

2025
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,050
that first step,

2026
01:00:03,230 --> 01:00:03,591
you know,

2027
01:00:03,591 --> 01:00:07,670
and then just trust that if you stay and
you show up and you do that every time,

2028
01:00:08,030 --> 01:00:08,450
you know,

2029
01:00:08,450 --> 01:00:10,430
then some momentum going to start going.

2030
01:00:10,490 --> 01:00:11,120
It's,

2031
01:00:11,120 --> 01:00:11,870
you know,

2032
01:00:11,870 --> 01:00:13,160
it's this kind of a cliche,

2033
01:00:13,161 --> 01:00:14,810
it's that old Maslow pyramid,

2034
01:00:14,811 --> 01:00:15,281
you know,

2035
01:00:15,281 --> 01:00:16,114
of where the,

2036
01:00:16,260 --> 01:00:18,860
the basic needs of hunger or you know,

2037
01:00:18,890 --> 01:00:19,721
clothing got data dot.

2038
01:00:19,721 --> 01:00:20,720
And then when you get to the top,

2039
01:00:20,721 --> 01:00:21,710
which is where we are,

2040
01:00:22,220 --> 01:00:23,360
the needs become,

2041
01:00:23,361 --> 01:00:23,601
you know,

2042
01:00:23,601 --> 01:00:25,100
cause we have grocery stores,

2043
01:00:25,101 --> 01:00:25,251
you know,

2044
01:00:25,251 --> 01:00:26,930
there's no bombs going off in the street.

2045
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:31,520
So now it becomes self actualization
or asking the question,

2046
01:00:31,521 --> 01:00:31,701
Joe,

2047
01:00:31,701 --> 01:00:32,301
who am I?

2048
01:00:32,301 --> 01:00:33,140
Why am I here?

2049
01:00:33,141 --> 01:00:33,510
That at,

2050
01:00:33,510 --> 01:00:34,580
at all those tough questions,

2051
01:00:34,581 --> 01:00:35,250
right?

2052
01:00:35,250 --> 01:00:38,300
That the tribesmen don't have to ask
because they're too busy fighting off

2053
01:00:38,301 --> 01:00:38,591
grizzly.

2054
01:00:38,591 --> 01:00:39,410
Right.

2055
01:00:39,410 --> 01:00:44,240
And to me this is where something like
martial arts or any kind of a discipline

2056
01:00:44,241 --> 01:00:45,570
or art period,

2057
01:00:45,571 --> 01:00:46,670
the production of art,

2058
01:00:46,740 --> 01:00:47,860
this podcast,

2059
01:00:47,870 --> 01:00:49,070
your comedy,

2060
01:00:49,310 --> 01:00:50,270
whatever it is,

2061
01:00:50,690 --> 01:00:51,523
is,

2062
01:00:51,640 --> 01:00:52,130
and I don't,

2063
01:00:52,130 --> 01:00:53,840
I can't really put my finger on why,

2064
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:55,910
but I think it's an,

2065
01:00:55,970 --> 01:01:00,970
it's an answer to this
thing of being alone,

2066
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:02,690
being an individual,

2067
01:01:02,810 --> 01:01:07,610
being unfettered from the tribal structure
or from any structure where we're

2068
01:01:07,611 --> 01:01:09,170
kind of floating in space.

2069
01:01:09,470 --> 01:01:09,801
You know,

2070
01:01:09,801 --> 01:01:12,190
like a George Clooney and w,

2071
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:12,411
you know,

2072
01:01:12,411 --> 01:01:14,360
trying to figure out who,

2073
01:01:14,570 --> 01:01:15,050
you know,

2074
01:01:15,050 --> 01:01:15,771
who am I,

2075
01:01:15,771 --> 01:01:16,910
why am I here?

2076
01:01:17,210 --> 01:01:18,350
What do I want?

2077
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:19,640
Tough,

2078
01:01:19,640 --> 01:01:20,540
tough questions,

2079
01:01:20,560 --> 01:01:20,960
you know?

2080
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:21,230
Yeah,

2081
01:01:21,230 --> 01:01:22,300
very tough questions.

2082
01:01:22,340 --> 01:01:23,660
Very interesting questions.

2083
01:01:23,990 --> 01:01:26,960
I think that what you
said is really important.

2084
01:01:26,961 --> 01:01:28,460
That thing of cheat code,

2085
01:01:28,461 --> 01:01:30,500
that it's almost like
a cheat code to life.

2086
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:33,740
I think what's going on is
that's how we're designed.

2087
01:01:33,741 --> 01:01:37,790
We're designed to live that and that the
variables that we encounter on a day to

2088
01:01:37,791 --> 01:01:41,510
day basis are so beyond
our genetic capabilities.

2089
01:01:41,780 --> 01:01:45,290
The idea of keeping track
of 7 billion people's lives,

2090
01:01:45,350 --> 01:01:46,430
that's insane.

2091
01:01:46,460 --> 01:01:51,460
But that's where we're headed and I feel
like in the industrial age from from

2092
01:01:51,740 --> 01:01:51,951
the,

2093
01:01:51,951 --> 01:01:52,191
you know,

2094
01:01:52,191 --> 01:01:54,440
the creation of the machines to today,

2095
01:01:54,620 --> 01:01:58,640
we're essentially entering into slowly
but surely into a completely new

2096
01:01:58,641 --> 01:02:00,050
dimension of reality.

2097
01:02:00,350 --> 01:02:04,220
It's like what we've created in just
the short amount of time that we've had

2098
01:02:04,221 --> 01:02:07,670
electricity is staggeringly crazy.

2099
01:02:07,910 --> 01:02:09,200
The idea of the Internet,

2100
01:02:09,201 --> 01:02:10,340
the idea of computers,

2101
01:02:10,341 --> 01:02:11,540
big screen TVs,

2102
01:02:11,541 --> 01:02:12,440
projections,

2103
01:02:12,441 --> 01:02:13,790
the things that we can do today,

2104
01:02:13,791 --> 01:02:15,020
why find a plain,

2105
01:02:15,740 --> 01:02:16,700
insane,

2106
01:02:16,701 --> 01:02:19,590
insane stuff and it's just begun.

2107
01:02:19,770 --> 01:02:24,300
And I think that what we're facing and
what we're going to face over the next

2108
01:02:24,300 --> 01:02:24,301
hundred years,

2109
01:02:24,301 --> 01:02:24,731
200 years,

2110
01:02:24,731 --> 01:02:27,210
this is essentially going
to be like a new dimension,

2111
01:02:27,330 --> 01:02:32,040
like some sort of a virtual reality where
we exist symbiotically with computers

2112
01:02:32,041 --> 01:02:33,540
and the Internet and with each other.

2113
01:02:33,780 --> 01:02:36,300
And I think that our puny brains,

2114
01:02:36,380 --> 01:02:38,430
you know the three or four
or five of us in this room,

2115
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:40,500
we're not designed for this new world.

2116
01:02:40,530 --> 01:02:41,161
We are,

2117
01:02:41,161 --> 01:02:44,510
our brains are going to have to catch
up just much like the apes who spoken

2118
01:02:44,520 --> 01:02:47,850
grunts had to catch up with these clever
motherfuckers over figured out how to

2119
01:02:47,910 --> 01:02:52,740
talk with a slippery Tang and
actually say names and you know the,

2120
01:02:52,890 --> 01:02:55,320
I think it's all a part of growth.

2121
01:02:55,321 --> 01:02:55,800
It's all per,

2122
01:02:55,800 --> 01:02:56,431
we're not done.

2123
01:02:56,431 --> 01:02:57,660
The human race is not,

2124
01:02:57,690 --> 01:02:59,100
this is not the finished product.

2125
01:02:59,310 --> 01:03:02,220
This is like one step on a long road.

2126
01:03:02,940 --> 01:03:07,940
Probably an infinite road and our
creations are apart of what's enhancing or

2127
01:03:08,911 --> 01:03:10,890
changing or altering the world itself.

2128
01:03:11,060 --> 01:03:11,781
Well you were saying,

2129
01:03:11,781 --> 01:03:12,920
I think you're absolutely right Joe.

2130
01:03:12,921 --> 01:03:14,590
You were saying before that we're cavemen.

2131
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:20,000
And it's true because if you think about
the history of human beings from the

2132
01:03:20,061 --> 01:03:21,950
time we were homage to today,

2133
01:03:22,220 --> 01:03:23,750
you do that long line right?

2134
01:03:23,751 --> 01:03:27,380
And He's find that like the law only
the last one 10th of an inch is when we

2135
01:03:27,381 --> 01:03:29,060
were civilized and it's like,

2136
01:03:29,300 --> 01:03:29,720
you know,

2137
01:03:29,720 --> 01:03:32,960
a thousand miles the rest of
it when we were tribal people.

2138
01:03:33,230 --> 01:03:35,060
So we come into this world,

2139
01:03:35,450 --> 01:03:38,810
I believe with this tribal
template in our mind,

2140
01:03:38,811 --> 01:03:39,410
you know,

2141
01:03:39,410 --> 01:03:41,120
where it's important to us,

2142
01:03:41,121 --> 01:03:43,160
what our friends think of us,

2143
01:03:43,730 --> 01:03:44,031
you know,

2144
01:03:44,031 --> 01:03:47,660
we act to please others like
in high school where you know,

2145
01:03:47,661 --> 01:03:49,760
you have to be in the right
clique and where this and that.

2146
01:03:50,060 --> 01:03:50,893
And uh,

2147
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:52,250
it's only in this,

2148
01:03:52,251 --> 01:03:57,251
these last few seconds before midnight
that we discover that we're individuals

2149
01:03:58,130 --> 01:04:00,530
and we're not wired to be individuals.

2150
01:04:00,830 --> 01:04:01,700
And that's where,

2151
01:04:02,270 --> 01:04:02,990
to me,

2152
01:04:02,990 --> 01:04:05,060
resistance and stuff like that comes in.

2153
01:04:05,090 --> 01:04:09,470
That's what sort of would push us
back to being the in in the tribe,

2154
01:04:09,500 --> 01:04:10,310
in the,

2155
01:04:10,310 --> 01:04:15,310
in the mass mind in that kind of thing
as opposed to going forward each morning

2156
01:04:15,801 --> 01:04:20,450
one step at a time and it's in
that dark forest finding out,

2157
01:04:20,451 --> 01:04:20,870
you know,

2158
01:04:20,870 --> 01:04:21,703
where,

2159
01:04:21,770 --> 01:04:22,581
where we are,

2160
01:04:22,581 --> 01:04:23,271
what we think,

2161
01:04:23,271 --> 01:04:24,104
what we believe.

2162
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:27,880
I think it's a very important point you
said about people not being designed to

2163
01:04:27,881 --> 01:04:32,881
be individuals and it's very ironic that
the people that live in cities are way

2164
01:04:33,101 --> 01:04:36,220
lonely or when there's 20 million people
around and the people that live in a

2165
01:04:36,221 --> 01:04:37,720
tribe where there's 20 people around.

2166
01:04:38,140 --> 01:04:40,750
That's so ironic and so strange though.

2167
01:04:40,751 --> 01:04:42,430
The loss of community,

2168
01:04:42,610 --> 01:04:45,430
like I keep saying with my friends like
why don't we just buy houses in the same

2169
01:04:45,431 --> 01:04:46,240
street?

2170
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:46,991
Like what are we doing?

2171
01:04:46,991 --> 01:04:48,640
Like why do we live so
far from each other?

2172
01:04:48,850 --> 01:04:51,640
Wouldn't it be cool if you were right
there and I could just knock on your door?

2173
01:04:51,820 --> 01:04:53,200
Like why don't we figure that out?

2174
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:58,270
But we were so used to this idea of cars
driving to homes that no one lives next

2175
01:04:58,271 --> 01:04:59,320
to their friends anymore.

2176
01:04:59,530 --> 01:05:04,390
And our sense of community depending
upon where you live can get like really

2177
01:05:04,391 --> 01:05:04,901
sketchy.

2178
01:05:04,901 --> 01:05:08,470
Like I was talking to my friend Jim
Norton who lives in a giant apartment

2179
01:05:08,471 --> 01:05:09,490
building in New York City.

2180
01:05:09,491 --> 01:05:10,720
It's fucking huge.

2181
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:12,460
And he doesn't know anybody.

2182
01:05:12,820 --> 01:05:17,820
There were all these compartments in
this giant cement box and shares with

2183
01:05:18,010 --> 01:05:18,671
all these people.

2184
01:05:18,671 --> 01:05:21,520
I mean literally if he
could walk through a wall,

2185
01:05:21,550 --> 01:05:22,450
he could catch,

2186
01:05:22,520 --> 01:05:23,980
you could touch someone
while they're peeing.

2187
01:05:24,190 --> 01:05:25,660
I mean they're right next to his head,

2188
01:05:25,900 --> 01:05:27,910
but yet he doesn't know that guy at all.

2189
01:05:28,170 --> 01:05:31,330
That's a weird thing that we've created
and I don't think we're designed for it.

2190
01:05:31,331 --> 01:05:32,560
I don't think we're designed for it.

2191
01:05:32,561 --> 01:05:34,960
But I think there's hope
and the hope is that we're,

2192
01:05:34,961 --> 01:05:35,201
you know,

2193
01:05:35,201 --> 01:05:37,870
we're kind of like this meet
vehicle with the computer,

2194
01:05:37,900 --> 01:05:38,360
you know,

2195
01:05:38,360 --> 01:05:42,790
Amit vehicle with a computer and then
out there somewhere is new source code,

2196
01:05:42,990 --> 01:05:43,390
you know,

2197
01:05:43,390 --> 01:05:45,610
and just like a new life by Iphone,

2198
01:05:45,611 --> 01:05:49,330
we'll just plug in new software
and new operating system.

2199
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:51,100
You know when you plug it back in,

2200
01:05:51,310 --> 01:05:55,690
I think that's what's going to help us
navigate this pass is we got to plug back

2201
01:05:55,691 --> 01:05:56,620
into the mother code,

2202
01:05:56,621 --> 01:05:57,454
the source code,

2203
01:05:57,580 --> 01:06:01,660
and then download new instructions for
this meet vehicle that we're all walking

2204
01:06:01,661 --> 01:06:02,360
around it.

2205
01:06:02,360 --> 01:06:04,540
I think you're only way
that the only way to do it.

2206
01:06:04,541 --> 01:06:07,870
And so in doing so you'll have
all kinds of ancillary benefits,

2207
01:06:07,871 --> 01:06:09,790
not only of how to fit into society,

2208
01:06:09,791 --> 01:06:10,541
but you know,

2209
01:06:10,541 --> 01:06:11,141
as you said,

2210
01:06:11,141 --> 01:06:12,370
define your authentic swing,

2211
01:06:12,371 --> 01:06:13,390
your authentic self.

2212
01:06:13,690 --> 01:06:13,881
You know,

2213
01:06:13,881 --> 01:06:15,490
cause that's there in that code to,

2214
01:06:15,700 --> 01:06:17,830
and you've just got to find
the ways to plug back in

2215
01:06:18,510 --> 01:06:19,800
the flip side to what you were saying,

2216
01:06:19,801 --> 01:06:20,061
Joe,

2217
01:06:20,061 --> 01:06:21,750
is like you were saying that,

2218
01:06:22,530 --> 01:06:24,390
isn't it a shame that we're all isolated.

2219
01:06:24,391 --> 01:06:25,580
We can't live with our friends,

2220
01:06:25,581 --> 01:06:26,970
we can't have kind of the tribe.

2221
01:06:27,390 --> 01:06:28,860
And you know,

2222
01:06:28,861 --> 01:06:31,470
there's a big element of
truth in that in our heart.

2223
01:06:32,040 --> 01:06:32,430
But this,

2224
01:06:32,430 --> 01:06:33,690
the flip side of that is,

2225
01:06:33,691 --> 01:06:36,480
and I feel this a lot
is I want to be alone.

2226
01:06:37,320 --> 01:06:37,980
You know,

2227
01:06:37,980 --> 01:06:38,370
when,

2228
01:06:38,370 --> 01:06:42,780
when I'm in a group and I got to do shit
that other people want to do or I have

2229
01:06:42,781 --> 01:06:45,720
to conform to what their
expectations of me are.

2230
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:46,531
Fuck that.

2231
01:06:46,531 --> 01:06:46,830
You know,

2232
01:06:46,830 --> 01:06:47,730
I don't want that at all.

2233
01:06:48,920 --> 01:06:50,820
And the other thing is,

2234
01:06:50,940 --> 01:06:51,540
and I'll,

2235
01:06:51,540 --> 01:06:53,340
I'll just blow it up if I have to,

2236
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:54,120
you know,

2237
01:06:54,120 --> 01:06:54,720
uh,

2238
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:56,640
and the other thing
that's really a mystery,

2239
01:06:56,641 --> 01:06:57,840
kind of what you were saying Aubrey,

2240
01:06:57,841 --> 01:07:01,380
is nobody's ever figured out
why we had this big brain.

2241
01:07:02,190 --> 01:07:02,760
Right.

2242
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:03,593
We never,

2243
01:07:03,750 --> 01:07:07,950
it's not like we incrementally evolved
it cause we had to learn to throw a stone

2244
01:07:07,951 --> 01:07:10,800
and then we had to learn to shoot a bow
and Arrow and it's like all of a sudden

2245
01:07:10,801 --> 01:07:13,290
this is why they have all
these crazy scifi movies,

2246
01:07:13,291 --> 01:07:13,501
you know,

2247
01:07:13,501 --> 01:07:14,940
the talk about and we whatever.

2248
01:07:15,180 --> 01:07:17,130
But where did it come from?

2249
01:07:17,131 --> 01:07:17,941
And I know,

2250
01:07:17,941 --> 01:07:22,941
I mean I can feel it in my own head right
now I'm using like one 0.0 of what's

2251
01:07:23,551 --> 01:07:24,330
up there.

2252
01:07:24,330 --> 01:07:25,440
And I know we all are.

2253
01:07:25,620 --> 01:07:28,260
So who knows what's up.

2254
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:29,020
We got that.

2255
01:07:29,020 --> 01:07:29,371
We got a,

2256
01:07:29,371 --> 01:07:30,070
the hardware,

2257
01:07:30,070 --> 01:07:33,610
we just don't have the software
but the software and we don't,

2258
01:07:33,611 --> 01:07:34,091
I mean,

2259
01:07:34,091 --> 01:07:37,240
it's obvious too that there's
ways to maximize this hardware.

2260
01:07:37,300 --> 01:07:37,751
Absolutely.

2261
01:07:37,751 --> 01:07:40,960
And some of us have grasped
certain areas of it.

2262
01:07:41,110 --> 01:07:43,180
Some of us have a grasp it athletically.

2263
01:07:43,181 --> 01:07:44,014
Some of them has.

2264
01:07:44,020 --> 01:07:45,580
Some of them was like yourself.

2265
01:07:45,581 --> 01:07:46,720
I've done it creatively.

2266
01:07:46,870 --> 01:07:47,041
Would,

2267
01:07:47,041 --> 01:07:48,670
there's all like these weird little,

2268
01:07:48,671 --> 01:07:50,350
like this guys figured out this thing.

2269
01:07:50,351 --> 01:07:51,550
You now you know how to work your,

2270
01:07:51,551 --> 01:07:51,911
this,

2271
01:07:51,911 --> 01:07:52,744
you know?

2272
01:07:53,500 --> 01:07:55,030
But the thing is so complicated,

2273
01:07:55,031 --> 01:07:55,630
the brain,

2274
01:07:55,630 --> 01:07:56,590
the body itself,

2275
01:07:56,591 --> 01:07:58,060
it's such a weird vehicle.

2276
01:07:58,420 --> 01:07:59,440
It's so complicated.

2277
01:07:59,441 --> 01:08:02,350
It's almost impossible in this
day and age to get it right.

2278
01:08:02,560 --> 01:08:03,640
But back in the happy,

2279
01:08:03,641 --> 01:08:04,720
the ty got days,

2280
01:08:05,020 --> 01:08:05,291
you know,

2281
01:08:05,291 --> 01:08:07,570
if you were one of those
crazy guys living in Siberia,

2282
01:08:07,870 --> 01:08:09,610
you mean there's some
shit you got to learn.

2283
01:08:09,670 --> 01:08:10,031
Yeah.

2284
01:08:10,031 --> 01:08:12,100
Don't go in the river when it's frozen,

2285
01:08:12,760 --> 01:08:13,151
you know,

2286
01:08:13,151 --> 01:08:13,571
don't,

2287
01:08:13,571 --> 01:08:13,840
uh,

2288
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:14,860
don't fall through the ice.

2289
01:08:14,861 --> 01:08:15,540
Don't do that.

2290
01:08:15,540 --> 01:08:15,980
When a moose

2291
01:08:15,980 --> 01:08:16,790
comes run.

2292
01:08:16,790 --> 01:08:17,031
Uh,

2293
01:08:17,031 --> 01:08:17,864
what else?

2294
01:08:17,930 --> 01:08:18,500
Uh,

2295
01:08:18,500 --> 01:08:19,640
this is how saw works.

2296
01:08:19,820 --> 01:08:20,390
You know,

2297
01:08:20,390 --> 01:08:21,660
there's a lot of shit you don't have to,

2298
01:08:21,661 --> 01:08:22,221
are there Joe?

2299
01:08:22,221 --> 01:08:25,100
They would kick you out of the tribe
and if they don't kick you out,

2300
01:08:25,101 --> 01:08:26,060
you'd leave yourself.

2301
01:08:26,090 --> 01:08:26,361
No,

2302
01:08:26,361 --> 01:08:27,081
you know what I would do?

2303
01:08:27,081 --> 01:08:28,370
I would just manipulate those schools.

2304
01:08:29,540 --> 01:08:32,840
I figured out a way to start my own call
to and I just make up a bunch of shit

2305
01:08:32,841 --> 01:08:33,674
and see who's with me.

2306
01:08:34,070 --> 01:08:35,870
Speaking at tribes is a little off topic,

2307
01:08:35,871 --> 01:08:36,710
but one of the most,

2308
01:08:37,340 --> 01:08:39,800
the coolest collections of
photographs I've ever seen.

2309
01:08:39,801 --> 01:08:41,390
It's from this artist called,

2310
01:08:41,480 --> 01:08:44,720
it's that before they.com
and check it out.

2311
01:08:44,930 --> 01:08:47,180
It's like all the tribes
and the ideas before they,

2312
01:08:47,181 --> 01:08:48,250
before they die,

2313
01:08:48,410 --> 01:08:49,041
before they met,

2314
01:08:49,041 --> 01:08:50,300
before they pass away,

2315
01:08:50,750 --> 01:08:52,580
before they get assimilated.

2316
01:08:52,590 --> 01:08:54,860
And the photographs are stunning.

2317
01:08:54,861 --> 01:08:55,041
You know,

2318
01:08:55,041 --> 01:08:58,850
they have the eagle hunters in Mongolia
and the different tribes from Africa.

2319
01:08:58,851 --> 01:09:00,560
So if you want to kind of take a look,

2320
01:09:00,561 --> 01:09:01,730
I think the book is about to go on.

2321
01:09:02,030 --> 01:09:06,850
Here's another kind of fascinating
part about tribalism that if,

2322
01:09:06,940 --> 01:09:11,290
if we were to really insert
ourselves into that world,

2323
01:09:11,830 --> 01:09:15,010
they live in dimensions beyond reality.

2324
01:09:15,190 --> 01:09:18,100
We like to think of these primitive
tribes has just these guys,

2325
01:09:18,110 --> 01:09:18,700
you know,

2326
01:09:18,700 --> 01:09:21,220
pounding stones on to Acorns,

2327
01:09:21,490 --> 01:09:24,430
but in fact they're things like will,

2328
01:09:24,450 --> 01:09:24,820
uh,

2329
01:09:24,820 --> 01:09:26,080
whatever tribe it is,

2330
01:09:26,081 --> 01:09:29,050
where you need to know where the deer are.

2331
01:09:29,260 --> 01:09:34,260
So you dream and in the dream you're
told where the deer are or Combo.

2332
01:09:35,051 --> 01:09:36,070
That's frog medicine.

2333
01:09:36,071 --> 01:09:39,250
When they burn themselves and take
this poison and put it on there,

2334
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:40,930
scan it says frog toxin,

2335
01:09:40,990 --> 01:09:43,900
and then apparently they can see
all the animals in the forest.

2336
01:09:44,140 --> 01:09:44,790
That's what they,

2337
01:09:44,790 --> 01:09:45,401
I believe it.

2338
01:09:45,401 --> 01:09:46,390
It's the same sort of thing.

2339
01:09:48,550 --> 01:09:53,350
There's one two days away if I run this
way and then they find it should be an

2340
01:09:53,351 --> 01:09:54,550
episode of Joe Rogan questions,

2341
01:09:54,551 --> 01:09:54,941
everything.

2342
01:09:54,941 --> 01:09:56,360
We should take that frog toxin.

2343
01:09:56,380 --> 01:09:57,250
See what you find that,

2344
01:09:57,650 --> 01:09:58,630
how dangerous is it?

2345
01:09:58,640 --> 01:10:00,670
Not Saying I need to know him.

2346
01:10:00,671 --> 01:10:02,530
And you go to Suriname and it's uh,

2347
01:10:02,550 --> 01:10:03,850
it's dangerous to the frog.

2348
01:10:04,420 --> 01:10:05,590
It's the only to the frog.

2349
01:10:05,650 --> 01:10:06,190
The frog.

2350
01:10:06,190 --> 01:10:07,840
The frog does not have a good go of it,

2351
01:10:07,940 --> 01:10:09,130
just harvesting and toxin.

2352
01:10:09,400 --> 01:10:10,990
But as far as the humans,

2353
01:10:11,020 --> 01:10:12,660
it's perfectly safe so that,

2354
01:10:12,910 --> 01:10:13,181
you know,

2355
01:10:13,181 --> 01:10:14,680
when the native American,

2356
01:10:14,790 --> 01:10:16,600
I just would look at the white man.

2357
01:10:17,140 --> 01:10:20,740
They thought we were just a
bunch of idiots because we

2358
01:10:21,110 --> 01:10:23,090
not tapped into that
other dimension at all.

2359
01:10:24,110 --> 01:10:25,160
How'd that work out for ya?

2360
01:10:26,210 --> 01:10:26,421
Yeah.

2361
01:10:26,421 --> 01:10:28,730
That's because the invention
of the Winchester rifle.

2362
01:10:28,731 --> 01:10:29,690
But other than that,

2363
01:10:29,750 --> 01:10:30,201
yeah.

2364
01:10:30,201 --> 01:10:30,831
And Polio,

2365
01:10:30,831 --> 01:10:31,664
smallpox,

2366
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:32,593
smallpox,

2367
01:10:33,390 --> 01:10:34,670
which goes to show you,

2368
01:10:34,671 --> 01:10:37,560
there's no justice in the world
because they would have won if the,

2369
01:10:37,570 --> 01:10:38,331
if there had been any,

2370
01:10:38,331 --> 01:10:39,620
just I learned that from ice cube.

2371
01:10:40,790 --> 01:10:41,361
No justice,

2372
01:10:41,361 --> 01:10:41,870
no peace.

2373
01:10:41,870 --> 01:10:42,111
Yeah.

2374
01:10:42,111 --> 01:10:42,531
I was in,

2375
01:10:42,531 --> 01:10:44,030
I was in Peru and they still,

2376
01:10:44,031 --> 01:10:44,390
you know,

2377
01:10:44,390 --> 01:10:46,350
some of the old shamanistic tradition,

2378
01:10:46,370 --> 01:10:50,540
those cultures still exist and they still
have the words for the Spaniards and

2379
01:10:50,541 --> 01:10:53,150
the people that came and in their mind,

2380
01:10:53,151 --> 01:10:53,301
you know,

2381
01:10:53,301 --> 01:10:56,640
part of the reason for the rainbow flag
is that's the colors of the shockers

2382
01:10:56,660 --> 01:10:57,440
that they see.

2383
01:10:57,440 --> 01:11:00,440
Like visually see inside
a person who's connected.

2384
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:03,920
And then these other people came in and
invaded their culture and they called

2385
01:11:03,921 --> 01:11:06,560
him the gray ones because
they didn't see that shit.

2386
01:11:06,561 --> 01:11:06,980
There was like,

2387
01:11:06,980 --> 01:11:07,813
Whoa,

2388
01:11:07,940 --> 01:11:12,470
what is this human walking around
that has no color for them?

2389
01:11:12,471 --> 01:11:14,100
It just because all of that was blocked

2390
01:11:14,100 --> 01:11:16,470
up and they weren't kind
of tapped in and connected.

2391
01:11:16,500 --> 01:11:18,690
So for them it's a very visual thing,

2392
01:11:18,720 --> 01:11:18,931
you know?

2393
01:11:18,931 --> 01:11:19,764
And you ask them,

2394
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:20,060
well,

2395
01:11:20,060 --> 01:11:20,551
why?

2396
01:11:20,551 --> 01:11:21,331
What are you talking about?

2397
01:11:21,331 --> 01:11:22,164
He's like,

2398
01:11:22,410 --> 01:11:23,220
what are you talking about?

2399
01:11:23,220 --> 01:11:24,053
Because I see it.

2400
01:11:24,150 --> 01:11:26,100
What kind of psychedelics
would they fucking around with?

2401
01:11:26,650 --> 01:11:27,090
Yeah,

2402
01:11:27,090 --> 01:11:31,560
I see there's a different reality
when you're consistently altering your

2403
01:11:31,561 --> 01:11:33,750
neurochemistry with psychedelic drugs.

2404
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:34,591
There's a,

2405
01:11:34,591 --> 01:11:35,400
there's a diff,

2406
01:11:35,400 --> 01:11:36,660
I've had moments.

2407
01:11:36,690 --> 01:11:37,071
There's the,

2408
01:11:37,071 --> 01:11:42,071
the last moment that I did DMT where I
said time to take a break where reality

2409
01:11:43,051 --> 01:11:46,050
got super slippery for about two weeks.

2410
01:11:46,051 --> 01:11:47,430
And when I say buy slippery,

2411
01:11:47,930 --> 01:11:48,440
the,

2412
01:11:48,440 --> 01:11:52,890
the psychedelic experience was so
profound and it was changing my regular

2413
01:11:52,891 --> 01:11:57,891
everyday mind so much that I felt like
a different person who I had to relearn

2414
01:11:58,321 --> 01:11:58,741
life.

2415
01:11:58,741 --> 01:12:03,240
Like I was thrown into this life with
a manual of this is what you've done so

2416
01:12:03,241 --> 01:12:03,480
far.

2417
01:12:03,480 --> 01:12:04,560
What are the fuck did I do that?

2418
01:12:04,720 --> 01:12:05,251
It doesn't matter.

2419
01:12:05,251 --> 01:12:09,990
This is what you did and this is who
you are now and ready go like it felt so

2420
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:12,240
unreal for a while that I'm,

2421
01:12:12,241 --> 01:12:16,680
I'm convinced that there was some sort
of a permanent change in the structure of

2422
01:12:16,681 --> 01:12:20,490
my brain or the way my brain accepts
certain chemicals are produced.

2423
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:25,260
It seems like a producer's one's in a
different way now and I think that if

2424
01:12:25,261 --> 01:12:28,410
you're doing that on a
regular basis every day,

2425
01:12:28,411 --> 01:12:29,730
day in day out,

2426
01:12:30,270 --> 01:12:32,490
these people were almost unrecognizable.

2427
01:12:32,580 --> 01:12:33,031
I mean they're,

2428
01:12:33,031 --> 01:12:33,631
they're all there.

2429
01:12:33,631 --> 01:12:36,710
They're reality is they
probably seeing flow like D,

2430
01:12:36,750 --> 01:12:37,950
we had David Show in here,

2431
01:12:38,130 --> 01:12:40,980
David show recently did IOWASCA
and now he says he trips every day.

2432
01:12:41,370 --> 01:12:41,731
He says,

2433
01:12:41,731 --> 01:12:42,570
I don't even have to do anything.

2434
01:12:42,571 --> 01:12:43,560
They were all in front of me right now.

2435
01:12:43,561 --> 01:12:44,550
I see a dragon in front of you.

2436
01:12:44,550 --> 01:12:48,090
It's flying through the air like
he sees flying snakes and he goes,

2437
01:12:48,091 --> 01:12:48,601
I can just,

2438
01:12:48,601 --> 01:12:49,381
I could just see them.

2439
01:12:49,381 --> 01:12:50,610
They're around us all the time.

2440
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:51,160
Yeah.

2441
01:12:51,160 --> 01:12:51,993
You remember the,

2442
01:12:52,010 --> 01:12:55,290
that you're normally used to seeing one
layer of the onion and then all of a

2443
01:12:55,291 --> 01:12:58,740
sudden you get to here's through all
the layers and see all these layers.

2444
01:12:58,741 --> 01:13:00,060
And David's not an idiot.

2445
01:13:00,090 --> 01:13:02,850
He's a brilliant guy and he's
cool as shit and he's not a liar.

2446
01:13:02,851 --> 01:13:04,710
So if he tells me he seeing those things,

2447
01:13:04,890 --> 01:13:06,840
I believe him 100%.

2448
01:13:07,080 --> 01:13:08,280
So what happened to him?

2449
01:13:08,610 --> 01:13:08,940
What,

2450
01:13:08,940 --> 01:13:10,980
what changed his mind?

2451
01:13:11,010 --> 01:13:13,080
What did that to his mind and fried?

2452
01:13:13,310 --> 01:13:13,480
Well,

2453
01:13:13,480 --> 01:13:13,621
let's,

2454
01:13:13,621 --> 01:13:14,160
I don't know.

2455
01:13:14,160 --> 01:13:18,840
It's not fried because you're only putting
something in that org already exists.

2456
01:13:19,290 --> 01:13:23,580
You through the real issue with
psychedelic drugs or you know,

2457
01:13:23,700 --> 01:13:24,980
anything that's uh,

2458
01:13:25,190 --> 01:13:25,280
uh,

2459
01:13:25,280 --> 01:13:28,680
a non native chemical that you're
introducing into your body.

2460
01:13:28,920 --> 01:13:30,570
You have LD 50 rates,

2461
01:13:30,571 --> 01:13:34,020
you have low rates of toxicity where it
becomes deadly to 50% of the people that

2462
01:13:34,021 --> 01:13:34,854
take it.

2463
01:13:34,920 --> 01:13:36,270
What is it for DMT?

2464
01:13:36,900 --> 01:13:39,200
No one even knows because
it's a human neurotransmitter.

2465
01:13:39,300 --> 01:13:41,370
It's a part of your natural
human brain chemistry.

2466
01:13:41,550 --> 01:13:43,680
That's what they're doing
when they're doing IOWASCA.

2467
01:13:43,860 --> 01:13:46,290
They're doing an orally
active version of this DMT.

2468
01:13:46,291 --> 01:13:47,124
So if this is,

2469
01:13:47,190 --> 01:13:49,260
if he seen fucking floating snakes,

2470
01:13:49,261 --> 01:13:50,071
maybe they're there.

2471
01:13:50,071 --> 01:13:51,060
We're just not seeing them.

2472
01:13:51,330 --> 01:13:54,210
Maybe we're not getting
enough DMT on a regular basis.

2473
01:13:54,350 --> 01:13:54,471
Yeah,

2474
01:13:54,471 --> 01:13:54,860
but if you,

2475
01:13:54,860 --> 01:13:55,693
if you take,

2476
01:13:55,760 --> 01:13:58,580
if you drink blood or if you
take put stuff in your body,

2477
01:13:58,581 --> 01:13:59,690
that really bad analogy.

2478
01:14:00,590 --> 01:14:01,071
I mean like,

2479
01:14:01,071 --> 01:14:01,641
like you're saying,

2480
01:14:01,641 --> 01:14:02,720
because it's from your body.

2481
01:14:02,721 --> 01:14:03,770
It's not bad because it's,

2482
01:14:03,830 --> 01:14:06,290
you're putting it in something that's
already been in your body back in your

2483
01:14:06,291 --> 01:14:06,621
body.

2484
01:14:06,621 --> 01:14:06,821
What?

2485
01:14:06,821 --> 01:14:09,890
That's you know more than you had before.

2486
01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:10,753
You know?

2487
01:14:10,790 --> 01:14:11,860
It's like,

2488
01:14:11,861 --> 01:14:12,110
if you

2489
01:14:12,110 --> 01:14:12,943
know what you're saying,

2490
01:14:13,990 --> 01:14:16,120
you're not taking estrogen.

2491
01:14:16,121 --> 01:14:17,320
If he too many soybeans,

2492
01:14:17,321 --> 01:14:17,830
it's bad.

2493
01:14:17,830 --> 01:14:18,170
Right?

2494
01:14:18,170 --> 01:14:20,950
You're not taking out something
and putting more in your,

2495
01:14:20,951 --> 01:14:23,200
you're adding more to it
that you're supposed to have.

2496
01:14:23,201 --> 01:14:25,030
So if you have too much
blood in your body,

2497
01:14:25,031 --> 01:14:25,864
it's probably bad.

2498
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:27,100
Or if you have too much,

2499
01:14:27,400 --> 01:14:28,000
you know what I mean?

2500
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:28,330
Any,

2501
01:14:28,330 --> 01:14:30,230
anything that's in your bodies,

2502
01:14:30,310 --> 01:14:31,180
it doesn't mean it's healthy.

2503
01:14:31,181 --> 01:14:32,890
If you put it back in
and that's a good point,

2504
01:14:32,891 --> 01:14:33,491
but it's,

2505
01:14:33,491 --> 01:14:38,200
it's not like blood and it's also the
most transient thing ever observed in the

2506
01:14:38,201 --> 01:14:38,830
body.

2507
01:14:38,830 --> 01:14:40,570
Your body brings it back to baseline.

2508
01:14:40,571 --> 01:14:44,680
I'm like 15 minutes from a full blown
trip into another dimension to back to

2509
01:14:44,681 --> 01:14:46,960
completely sober 15 minutes.

2510
01:14:47,080 --> 01:14:48,790
It's because your brain
knows how to handle it.

2511
01:14:48,791 --> 01:14:50,050
Your brain knows what it is.

2512
01:14:50,051 --> 01:14:50,261
It's,

2513
01:14:50,261 --> 01:14:51,370
it's there all the time.

2514
01:14:51,420 --> 01:14:51,780
Another,

2515
01:14:51,780 --> 01:14:52,060
I don't know,

2516
01:14:52,060 --> 01:14:52,281
but,

2517
01:14:52,281 --> 01:14:53,560
but you've got a good point though.

2518
01:14:53,770 --> 01:14:55,000
That's a really good point.

2519
01:14:55,001 --> 01:14:56,230
As far as hormones go,

2520
01:14:56,231 --> 01:14:58,990
that's a very big point with
what happens with guys when they,

2521
01:14:59,110 --> 01:14:59,740
they uh,

2522
01:14:59,740 --> 01:15:00,700
do steroids.

2523
01:15:00,940 --> 01:15:02,310
If you see like bodybuilders,

2524
01:15:02,320 --> 01:15:03,820
after they stopped doing steroids,

2525
01:15:03,821 --> 01:15:07,930
they usually have to take a bunch of
different drugs to try to boost back up

2526
01:15:08,140 --> 01:15:12,460
their body's production of testosterone
because they just shoot themselves up

2527
01:15:12,461 --> 01:15:15,160
with so much and they become the hulk.

2528
01:15:15,161 --> 01:15:15,730
I mean,

2529
01:15:15,730 --> 01:15:18,610
they're taking like hyper human levels,

2530
01:15:18,611 --> 01:15:21,220
10 15 times what a person would be,

2531
01:15:21,390 --> 01:15:22,223
you know,

2532
01:15:22,420 --> 01:15:24,940
putting into there are just
having their body grow.

2533
01:15:25,060 --> 01:15:26,860
They're just pumping the shit
in their body all the time.

2534
01:15:26,861 --> 01:15:27,640
All sorts of different.

2535
01:15:27,640 --> 01:15:28,540
So the balls just go,

2536
01:15:28,541 --> 01:15:29,374
you don't need us.

2537
01:15:29,530 --> 01:15:31,150
And I had the balls just check out.

2538
01:15:31,540 --> 01:15:34,690
So obviously putting too much
testosterone into your body,

2539
01:15:34,691 --> 01:15:35,620
it's dangerous.

2540
01:15:35,770 --> 01:15:38,110
Putting too much estrogen
has consequences as well.

2541
01:15:38,111 --> 01:15:39,240
So in that sense you've got to go,

2542
01:15:39,330 --> 01:15:39,490
well,

2543
01:15:39,490 --> 01:15:39,741
you know,

2544
01:15:39,741 --> 01:15:40,040
I might,

2545
01:15:40,040 --> 01:15:40,681
I think we,

2546
01:15:40,681 --> 01:15:42,820
we've talked a lot about
the drug way to do it,

2547
01:15:42,821 --> 01:15:45,190
but there's so many
non drug ways to do it.

2548
01:15:45,220 --> 01:15:45,431
I mean,

2549
01:15:45,431 --> 01:15:47,320
I've had visions as intense as,

2550
01:15:47,620 --> 01:15:47,831
you know,

2551
01:15:47,831 --> 01:15:51,640
some of the visions on
psychedelics in deep meditation.

2552
01:15:51,670 --> 01:15:51,911
You know,

2553
01:15:51,911 --> 01:15:52,900
when I went and floated,

2554
01:15:52,901 --> 01:15:56,890
I had a really deep visions when I do
a breathwork ceremony where you do this

2555
01:15:56,891 --> 01:15:57,790
shamonic breathing,

2556
01:15:57,791 --> 01:16:02,410
where you hyper kind of hyperventilate
yourself and get to a state of heightened

2557
01:16:02,411 --> 01:16:02,980
awareness,

2558
01:16:02,980 --> 01:16:04,960
you start to see some
of the similar things.

2559
01:16:04,961 --> 01:16:06,070
So for me,

2560
01:16:06,071 --> 01:16:06,281
you know,

2561
01:16:06,281 --> 01:16:09,910
I hear David chose story and he's
already taken care of all of his needs.

2562
01:16:09,940 --> 01:16:12,010
That guy has no Maslow,

2563
01:16:12,011 --> 01:16:12,341
one,

2564
01:16:12,341 --> 01:16:12,571
two,

2565
01:16:12,571 --> 01:16:12,970
three,

2566
01:16:12,970 --> 01:16:14,650
four are taken care of.

2567
01:16:14,680 --> 01:16:17,380
And he's a visionary artists already.

2568
01:16:17,381 --> 01:16:21,610
And then he takes something that pries
open his doors of perception temporarily,

2569
01:16:21,730 --> 01:16:21,971
you know,

2570
01:16:21,971 --> 01:16:26,500
turns the Venetian blinds sideways for
a while and then all of a sudden maybe

2571
01:16:26,501 --> 01:16:27,550
his brain decides,

2572
01:16:27,670 --> 01:16:28,480
you know what,

2573
01:16:28,480 --> 01:16:30,790
I don't really need to turn
them back closed again.

2574
01:16:31,050 --> 01:16:31,400
You know,

2575
01:16:31,400 --> 01:16:34,420
I can give him open just a little
bit cause I'm going to be fine.

2576
01:16:34,600 --> 01:16:37,750
And there's a lot of cool information
and visions and things out there.

2577
01:16:38,020 --> 01:16:39,160
So I think that,

2578
01:16:39,161 --> 01:16:39,491
to me,

2579
01:16:39,491 --> 01:16:40,690
that's the alternate explanation.

2580
01:16:40,780 --> 01:16:41,950
That's a possible explanation.

2581
01:16:41,951 --> 01:16:42,820
But he might be right too.

2582
01:16:42,821 --> 01:16:43,870
He might have fried his brain,

2583
01:16:44,500 --> 01:16:45,250
he might,

2584
01:16:45,250 --> 01:16:46,570
he might have gone too far in.

2585
01:16:46,571 --> 01:16:47,440
The brain's just not,

2586
01:16:47,580 --> 01:16:52,180
it's just the reason why
other aspect of this,

2587
01:16:52,181 --> 01:16:53,014
as if we're,

2588
01:16:53,110 --> 01:16:55,900
if we're trying to imagine our
shelter to tribal cultures that are,

2589
01:16:55,930 --> 01:16:56,380
you know,

2590
01:16:56,380 --> 01:16:58,150
she visions on a regular basis.

2591
01:16:58,510 --> 01:16:59,740
Like if it happens to you,

2592
01:16:59,741 --> 01:17:00,250
Joe,

2593
01:17:00,250 --> 01:17:03,820
you're just an individual
without any structure around you.

2594
01:17:04,060 --> 01:17:05,020
There's no teacher,

2595
01:17:05,021 --> 01:17:07,090
there's no sham and there's
nobody who can guide you.

2596
01:17:07,360 --> 01:17:10,400
But how do we know that
in these tribal cultures,

2597
01:17:10,460 --> 01:17:12,530
I mean for hundreds and hundreds,

2598
01:17:12,530 --> 01:17:13,363
thousands of years,

2599
01:17:13,580 --> 01:17:13,971
you know,

2600
01:17:13,971 --> 01:17:14,200
the,

2601
01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:16,700
the elders have known how to navigate it.

2602
01:17:16,910 --> 01:17:17,840
Here's how you do it.

2603
01:17:18,080 --> 01:17:19,040
And you know,

2604
01:17:19,041 --> 01:17:19,460
when you,

2605
01:17:19,460 --> 01:17:21,080
when you enter that crazy space,

2606
01:17:21,350 --> 01:17:21,711
you know,

2607
01:17:21,711 --> 01:17:22,341
if there are,

2608
01:17:22,341 --> 01:17:26,030
if your uncle is there and he can teach
you and show you how to do this and your

2609
01:17:26,031 --> 01:17:27,100
brother and then Nada,

2610
01:17:27,470 --> 01:17:28,520
maybe that's the way it goes.

2611
01:17:28,521 --> 01:17:33,140
And maybe they are living in that world
all the time and seeing the dragons and

2612
01:17:33,141 --> 01:17:34,280
seeing all that stuff.

2613
01:17:34,310 --> 01:17:34,640
You know,

2614
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:35,630
it wouldn't surprise me.

2615
01:17:35,660 --> 01:17:36,051
I know,

2616
01:17:36,051 --> 01:17:37,000
I know my Iowa

2617
01:17:37,130 --> 01:17:37,370
Shama,

2618
01:17:37,370 --> 01:17:41,070
I'm pretty well my store Orlando
too and off down from Peru and he,

2619
01:17:41,310 --> 01:17:44,310
he drinks Iowasca in
ceremony probably five,

2620
01:17:44,311 --> 01:17:45,144
six nights a week.

2621
01:17:45,170 --> 01:17:47,240
Tell me what is Iowasca I
don't know what that is.

2622
01:17:47,241 --> 01:17:47,750
So it's,

2623
01:17:47,750 --> 01:17:48,261
it's a,

2624
01:17:48,261 --> 01:17:49,680
it's a psychoactive,

2625
01:17:49,681 --> 01:17:49,870
yeah.

2626
01:17:49,870 --> 01:17:50,560
Oral,

2627
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:52,690
oral t that they brew from Dmt,

2628
01:17:52,691 --> 01:17:54,370
which comes from the [inaudible],

2629
01:17:54,760 --> 01:17:57,760
which is like 0.27% DMT or whatever.

2630
01:17:57,761 --> 01:17:59,470
And they brew that with an Maoi,

2631
01:17:59,471 --> 01:18:02,680
which is a vine that allows
it to be orally active.

2632
01:18:03,100 --> 01:18:08,050
And so they drink this brew and you have
a DMT experience that lasts for four to

2633
01:18:08,051 --> 01:18:08,884
six hours.

2634
01:18:09,170 --> 01:18:12,700
T is killed in the gut
by monoamine oxidase.

2635
01:18:12,701 --> 01:18:13,540
So when you take,

2636
01:18:13,750 --> 01:18:16,390
like if you're eating
grass like flares glass,

2637
01:18:16,450 --> 01:18:17,740
it has DMT in it.

2638
01:18:18,070 --> 01:18:19,690
And if you were eating that grass,

2639
01:18:19,710 --> 01:18:19,960
you're,

2640
01:18:19,960 --> 01:18:23,530
you would just start tripping your balls
off if your stomach didn't produce this

2641
01:18:24,040 --> 01:18:24,551
stuff,

2642
01:18:24,551 --> 01:18:28,970
this mono aiming that it
keeps monoamine oxidase the,

2643
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:30,790
keeps the DMT from being orally active.

2644
01:18:30,791 --> 01:18:31,990
So when they combine the two of them,

2645
01:18:31,991 --> 01:18:33,520
when the combine the harming and the,

2646
01:18:33,530 --> 01:18:33,860
uh,

2647
01:18:33,860 --> 01:18:37,300
the headbutt or of that compound
that breaks it down an Aoi,

2648
01:18:37,350 --> 01:18:38,700
you guys are deep into this shit.

2649
01:18:40,740 --> 01:18:43,880
I tools that I use the tap.

2650
01:18:44,480 --> 01:18:44,691
Well,

2651
01:18:44,691 --> 01:18:45,470
it's also,

2652
01:18:45,470 --> 01:18:45,960
it's,

2653
01:18:45,960 --> 01:18:47,000
it's to me,

2654
01:18:47,210 --> 01:18:47,810
um,

2655
01:18:47,810 --> 01:18:48,140
it,

2656
01:18:48,140 --> 01:18:53,140
it's almost makes me sad when someone
does know about it because it's so crazy

2657
01:18:53,360 --> 01:18:56,840
and it's so real and so
vivid and so memorable.

2658
01:18:56,841 --> 01:18:58,580
And so life changing.

2659
01:18:58,910 --> 01:18:59,091
Uh,

2660
01:18:59,091 --> 01:18:59,901
Amber Lyon,

2661
01:18:59,901 --> 01:19:01,040
who was our friend from,

2662
01:19:01,160 --> 01:19:03,090
she used to work for CNN and a,

2663
01:19:03,160 --> 01:19:06,950
now she's become a crazy psychedelic
adventure from the podcast.

2664
01:19:06,980 --> 01:19:09,020
We were on the podcast and she asked me,

2665
01:19:09,021 --> 01:19:09,261
uh,

2666
01:19:09,261 --> 01:19:10,880
about ways to change the world.

2667
01:19:10,881 --> 01:19:11,061
You know,

2668
01:19:11,061 --> 01:19:16,061
she's seen a lot of shit and she's been
all over the world and been involved in,

2669
01:19:16,071 --> 01:19:16,710
you know,

2670
01:19:16,710 --> 01:19:19,370
like covering like some intense conflicts.

2671
01:19:19,820 --> 01:19:21,500
And I said Psychedelics,

2672
01:19:21,501 --> 01:19:22,790
I think that psychedelic drugs,

2673
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:23,633
he'd change the world.

2674
01:19:23,990 --> 01:19:24,823
I think that,

2675
01:19:24,950 --> 01:19:25,783
you know,

2676
01:19:25,970 --> 01:19:26,960
for some people it doesn't,

2677
01:19:26,961 --> 01:19:28,280
for some people just get some high.

2678
01:19:28,460 --> 01:19:30,140
For some people they don't want to change,

2679
01:19:30,141 --> 01:19:31,490
they don't want to explore.

2680
01:19:31,700 --> 01:19:32,240
But if you,

2681
01:19:32,240 --> 01:19:36,860
if you want to really see some shit that
you didn't even think could be possible

2682
01:19:36,861 --> 01:19:37,694
in a movie,

2683
01:19:38,480 --> 01:19:38,841
there's,

2684
01:19:38,841 --> 01:19:40,100
there's some ways out there.

2685
01:19:40,130 --> 01:19:41,450
There's some methods you can,

2686
01:19:41,451 --> 01:19:42,500
you could find those methods.

2687
01:19:42,501 --> 01:19:43,251
And like Aubrey said,

2688
01:19:43,251 --> 01:19:43,641
a lot of them,

2689
01:19:43,641 --> 01:19:45,380
they aren't even a drug related.

2690
01:19:45,590 --> 01:19:48,710
You can have a naturally occurring
psychedelic trip and an isolation tank.

2691
01:19:49,700 --> 01:19:50,840
And that's what Mckenna it,

2692
01:19:50,841 --> 01:19:51,990
Terence Mckenna believe,

2693
01:19:51,991 --> 01:19:54,050
and we were talking about the
growth of the human brain,

2694
01:19:54,230 --> 01:19:57,200
the doubling of the human brain size
over a period of 2 million years,

2695
01:19:57,440 --> 01:20:00,470
Trans Mckenna had a whole
theory about that being,

2696
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:03,050
having to do with climate change.

2697
01:20:03,051 --> 01:20:07,740
And primates experimenting
with Psychedelic mushrooms
that the rain forests

2698
01:20:07,770 --> 01:20:12,390
receded into grasslands and that these
chimps started following around or you

2699
01:20:12,391 --> 01:20:12,541
know,

2700
01:20:12,541 --> 01:20:17,541
are ancient hominid ancestors started
following around these cows and that wild

2701
01:20:18,721 --> 01:20:22,320
cows and eating the mushrooms that grow
on their shit and they were prevalent in

2702
01:20:22,321 --> 01:20:23,154
that area.

2703
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:26,040
And he has it like he had it broken down,

2704
01:20:26,041 --> 01:20:26,700
he died,

2705
01:20:26,700 --> 01:20:29,370
but he had it broken down in terms of the,

2706
01:20:29,371 --> 01:20:29,650
the,

2707
01:20:29,650 --> 01:20:30,560
the time of the,

2708
01:20:30,561 --> 01:20:31,740
the climate change,

2709
01:20:31,741 --> 01:20:33,690
and it was very controversial theory,

2710
01:20:33,691 --> 01:20:35,430
but one of the best ones,

2711
01:20:35,431 --> 01:20:38,730
and it's poopooed because it
involves psychedelic mushrooms,

2712
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:43,770
but the reality is anybody who poo poos
psychedelic mushrooms has simply not

2713
01:20:43,771 --> 01:20:45,240
done psychedelic mushrooms.

2714
01:20:45,330 --> 01:20:49,110
Because if you've done them and you blow
your mind out and have this in crazy,

2715
01:20:49,370 --> 01:20:54,370
the Egyptian icons dancing or in front
of your eyes and fluorescent colors and

2716
01:20:55,500 --> 01:20:58,470
explain to you the nature of life
through a voice that you can understand,

2717
01:20:58,471 --> 01:20:58,801
but you know,

2718
01:20:58,801 --> 01:20:59,634
as an English,

2719
01:21:00,330 --> 01:21:02,100
once that that experience has happened,

2720
01:21:02,101 --> 01:21:02,371
you'd go,

2721
01:21:02,371 --> 01:21:02,641
okay,

2722
01:21:02,641 --> 01:21:03,600
that exists.

2723
01:21:03,990 --> 01:21:04,823
That exists.

2724
01:21:04,830 --> 01:21:06,390
How many people have experienced this?

2725
01:21:06,391 --> 01:21:07,260
How many people have this?

2726
01:21:07,261 --> 01:21:08,370
If you gave that to monkeys,

2727
01:21:08,371 --> 01:21:09,204
what would happen?

2728
01:21:09,330 --> 01:21:11,490
And I think that without a doubt,

2729
01:21:11,580 --> 01:21:13,350
that's the most likely candidate.

2730
01:21:13,710 --> 01:21:17,970
It's just seems ridiculous
because we've demonized all drugs.

2731
01:21:17,971 --> 01:21:19,980
We put them all into
this big stupid blanket.

2732
01:21:20,190 --> 01:21:22,200
And so things like psychedelics,

2733
01:21:22,201 --> 01:21:25,440
which may very well be
vehicles for evolution.

2734
01:21:25,560 --> 01:21:29,880
I mean it might be there looking like a
big dinner plate sitting in the middle

2735
01:21:29,881 --> 01:21:33,150
of a field because it wants you to
eat it so he can tell you things.

2736
01:21:33,540 --> 01:21:36,210
And it visual acuity
increased in visual acuity.

2737
01:21:36,211 --> 01:21:36,481
There's like,

2738
01:21:36,481 --> 01:21:36,640
oh,

2739
01:21:36,640 --> 01:21:38,320
he had a whole bunch of points that,

2740
01:21:38,340 --> 01:21:38,730
that,

2741
01:21:38,730 --> 01:21:40,350
that led to this idea.

2742
01:21:40,500 --> 01:21:41,460
May the um,

2743
01:21:41,690 --> 01:21:42,390
uh,

2744
01:21:42,390 --> 01:21:44,760
stimulation of male genitalia,

2745
01:21:45,210 --> 01:21:48,330
increased erections when they're
eating a psilocybin mushrooms,

2746
01:21:48,540 --> 01:21:49,980
the a in small doses,

2747
01:21:50,010 --> 01:21:52,830
a measurable increase in visual acuity,

2748
01:21:52,950 --> 01:21:54,540
which would lead them
to be better hunters,

2749
01:21:54,541 --> 01:21:55,950
which lead them to survive better.

2750
01:21:56,130 --> 01:22:00,330
Like all these different points
besides the psychedelic experience.

2751
01:22:00,450 --> 01:22:04,800
All these different points lead to this
idea that the animals that embrace that

2752
01:22:04,801 --> 01:22:06,750
into their diet would have a
better chance of surviving.

2753
01:22:07,320 --> 01:22:07,601
You know,

2754
01:22:07,601 --> 01:22:10,240
to bring this kind of back to
some of the stuff that you wrote.

2755
01:22:10,420 --> 01:22:12,970
I know from myself and the
psychedelic experience for me,

2756
01:22:12,971 --> 01:22:13,690
you wrote,

2757
01:22:13,690 --> 01:22:15,460
wrote in your book the authentic swing.

2758
01:22:15,760 --> 01:22:19,030
If we find ourselves lost
or tormented or in pain,

2759
01:22:19,240 --> 01:22:22,930
the reason is that we have somehow
become estranged from who we really are,

2760
01:22:23,110 --> 01:22:26,050
from the ground of our
individual being and for me,

2761
01:22:26,051 --> 01:22:26,681
when you know,

2762
01:22:26,681 --> 01:22:30,370
when I find myself in those kinds of
states where I'm a little sad or a little

2763
01:22:30,371 --> 01:22:31,570
lost or a little depressed,

2764
01:22:31,810 --> 01:22:32,261
for me,

2765
01:22:32,261 --> 01:22:33,400
the psychedelic experience,

2766
01:22:33,401 --> 01:22:33,881
like I said,

2767
01:22:33,881 --> 01:22:36,100
with or without drugs
could be a deep meditation,

2768
01:22:36,101 --> 01:22:36,934
could be anything.

2769
01:22:37,300 --> 01:22:42,300
It shows me back to my true self and then
it can allow me to be happy again and

2770
01:22:43,241 --> 01:22:45,190
it's just filled and full of life again.

2771
01:22:45,220 --> 01:22:47,140
Can you define Aubrey,

2772
01:22:47,141 --> 01:22:49,510
your true shelf as we can?

2773
01:22:51,940 --> 01:22:52,301
Well,

2774
01:22:52,301 --> 01:22:54,910
I've seen it and I've
felt it and I've been at,

2775
01:22:55,090 --> 01:22:55,451
you know,

2776
01:22:55,451 --> 01:22:56,470
I know when it's,

2777
01:22:56,471 --> 01:22:56,981
when it's there,

2778
01:22:56,981 --> 01:22:58,510
I know when it's operating the ship.

2779
01:22:58,540 --> 01:23:02,230
I had a long experience that actually
allowed me to see the differentiating

2780
01:23:02,231 --> 01:23:02,981
parts of myself,

2781
01:23:02,981 --> 01:23:03,970
the highest self.

2782
01:23:04,180 --> 01:23:05,013
Then the,

2783
01:23:05,380 --> 01:23:09,010
which I called mine boy because it was
very juvenile in the way that it kind of,

2784
01:23:09,100 --> 01:23:10,150
it loved puzzles,

2785
01:23:10,180 --> 01:23:11,410
love to figure things out,

2786
01:23:11,450 --> 01:23:12,010
love.

2787
01:23:12,010 --> 01:23:13,630
And then there was the monkey part of me,

2788
01:23:13,631 --> 01:23:13,901
you know,

2789
01:23:13,901 --> 01:23:14,380
the,

2790
01:23:14,380 --> 01:23:18,970
the flesh and blood and testosterone
and all of those things were all kind of

2791
01:23:18,971 --> 01:23:20,200
coalescing together.

2792
01:23:20,410 --> 01:23:20,770
Um,

2793
01:23:20,770 --> 01:23:22,900
but the highest self that part of me,

2794
01:23:22,901 --> 01:23:23,890
which you know,

2795
01:23:24,190 --> 01:23:26,830
is my authentic self is very clear to me.

2796
01:23:26,950 --> 01:23:27,783
And um,

2797
01:23:28,030 --> 01:23:29,350
it's something that I try to,

2798
01:23:29,560 --> 01:23:33,760
I try to get it to run the ship as often
as possible and push the mind out of

2799
01:23:33,761 --> 01:23:33,971
the way.

2800
01:23:33,971 --> 01:23:35,710
Cause the mind constantly
wants to take over.

2801
01:23:35,711 --> 01:23:35,950
It's a,

2802
01:23:35,950 --> 01:23:36,783
I got this shit,

2803
01:23:36,910 --> 01:23:37,230
you know,

2804
01:23:37,230 --> 01:23:38,130
leave it to me buddy,

2805
01:23:38,410 --> 01:23:38,621
you know,

2806
01:23:38,621 --> 01:23:40,030
I can solve all these puzzles.

2807
01:23:40,230 --> 01:23:40,511
Um,

2808
01:23:40,511 --> 01:23:42,400
but then when the highest
self is in charge,

2809
01:23:42,401 --> 01:23:43,960
that's when you're doing
your best work more,

2810
01:23:43,961 --> 01:23:46,760
but the highest shelf as
you experienced it yourself.

2811
01:23:46,830 --> 01:23:47,740
I feel like you in therapy.

2812
01:23:48,300 --> 01:23:49,133
Yeah.

2813
01:23:50,650 --> 01:23:52,030
I feel like you'd be an analyst,

2814
01:23:52,660 --> 01:23:53,050
you know,

2815
01:23:53,050 --> 01:23:53,883
the highest,

2816
01:23:54,160 --> 01:23:55,630
the highest self for me is,

2817
01:23:55,930 --> 01:23:57,340
is very,

2818
01:23:57,750 --> 01:23:59,830
it's very happy and it's very,

2819
01:23:59,831 --> 01:24:00,690
it's very contented.

2820
01:24:00,691 --> 01:24:01,524
It's very,

2821
01:24:01,900 --> 01:24:03,580
it loves the creation that it's in,

2822
01:24:03,581 --> 01:24:04,240
first of all,

2823
01:24:04,240 --> 01:24:06,550
and it loves the people of this creation.

2824
01:24:06,610 --> 01:24:10,400
And part of what it's here for is to,

2825
01:24:10,430 --> 01:24:11,061
I'm saying it,

2826
01:24:11,061 --> 01:24:13,810
it's me and it's kind of weird
to separate it like that,

2827
01:24:14,200 --> 01:24:16,240
but part of what it's here for is to,

2828
01:24:16,540 --> 01:24:16,780
uh,

2829
01:24:16,780 --> 01:24:17,021
you know,

2830
01:24:17,021 --> 01:24:17,291
I had,

2831
01:24:17,291 --> 01:24:18,740
I had a vision of it being a,

2832
01:24:18,760 --> 01:24:23,760
a nutcracker of sorts to just kind of go
through and roll along and spread ideas

2833
01:24:24,731 --> 01:24:29,110
and tools and different tactics and
things that people can kind of open their

2834
01:24:29,111 --> 01:24:30,130
shells a little bit too.

2835
01:24:30,131 --> 01:24:31,210
So I saw myself,

2836
01:24:31,211 --> 01:24:32,740
my highest self cast,

2837
01:24:32,741 --> 01:24:36,700
like a bowling ball that just a bowling
ball of light that just kind of rolls

2838
01:24:36,940 --> 01:24:38,050
around through the earth.

2839
01:24:38,050 --> 01:24:38,410
And,

2840
01:24:38,410 --> 01:24:39,370
and that to me,

2841
01:24:39,371 --> 01:24:41,170
I know when I'm in that mode,

2842
01:24:41,320 --> 01:24:42,430
and not only can I feel it,

2843
01:24:42,431 --> 01:24:43,570
not only can I see it,

2844
01:24:43,840 --> 01:24:44,081
you know,

2845
01:24:44,081 --> 01:24:45,160
visually my mind's eye,

2846
01:24:45,161 --> 01:24:47,500
but I know that that's what I'm here for.

2847
01:24:47,530 --> 01:24:47,711
You know,

2848
01:24:47,711 --> 01:24:48,820
that's my highest calling.

2849
01:24:48,821 --> 01:24:52,480
That's my authentic swing is when I'm
that bowling ball that rolls through and

2850
01:24:52,481 --> 01:24:52,930
says,

2851
01:24:52,930 --> 01:24:53,531
hey guys,

2852
01:24:53,531 --> 01:24:55,690
have you heard about this
thing called Iowasca hey guys,

2853
01:24:55,700 --> 01:24:59,290
we tried working out with a
Kettlebell or whatever it is.

2854
01:24:59,291 --> 01:24:59,650
You know,

2855
01:24:59,650 --> 01:25:02,070
part of that opening up the horizons to,

2856
01:25:02,310 --> 01:25:03,143
to other people,

2857
01:25:03,410 --> 01:25:08,410
this is your highest shelf content with
the way the world is or does it want to

2858
01:25:11,320 --> 01:25:14,980
help it evolve to something and know
it wants to fight like hell to help it

2859
01:25:14,981 --> 01:25:15,814
evolve.

2860
01:25:16,110 --> 01:25:17,440
It feels that it's,

2861
01:25:17,860 --> 01:25:19,440
it's off track a little bit and,

2862
01:25:19,441 --> 01:25:21,300
and there's some beautiful
things and you know,

2863
01:25:21,310 --> 01:25:22,900
I'm not disparaging the world,

2864
01:25:22,901 --> 01:25:26,790
but we've taken a veer
to the wrong way and uh,

2865
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:29,380
it's ready to the healing
grace shimmy the human race.

2866
01:25:29,380 --> 01:25:29,930
Yeah.

2867
01:25:29,930 --> 01:25:30,390
Red.

2868
01:25:30,390 --> 01:25:31,001
Cause you know,

2869
01:25:31,001 --> 01:25:33,160
the earth itself is in natural harmony,

2870
01:25:33,161 --> 01:25:36,790
but the human race puts the earth's
harmony out of balance as well as the

2871
01:25:36,791 --> 01:25:37,601
harmony amongst it.

2872
01:25:37,601 --> 01:25:39,820
So to bring it back into balance,

2873
01:25:40,390 --> 01:25:41,470
it wants to fight like hell.

2874
01:25:41,471 --> 01:25:43,930
And it's only happy when
it's fighting like hell,

2875
01:25:44,020 --> 01:25:44,291
you know?

2876
01:25:44,291 --> 01:25:45,460
And when it doesn't want to fight,

2877
01:25:45,760 --> 01:25:46,121
it's like,

2878
01:25:46,121 --> 01:25:47,000
what the hell am I doing?

2879
01:25:47,070 --> 01:25:49,030
I think we're in the middle
of it so we can't see it.

2880
01:25:49,360 --> 01:25:51,610
I think it's a giant
mathematical equation.

2881
01:25:51,611 --> 01:25:52,151
The pros,

2882
01:25:52,151 --> 01:25:52,751
the cons,

2883
01:25:52,751 --> 01:25:53,141
the good,

2884
01:25:53,141 --> 01:25:53,980
the bad,

2885
01:25:54,330 --> 01:25:55,151
the sucky,

2886
01:25:55,151 --> 01:25:55,984
the awesome.

2887
01:25:56,080 --> 01:25:57,100
It's all together.

2888
01:25:57,101 --> 01:26:02,050
And the resistance almost battles you to
make you appreciate when you accomplish

2889
01:26:02,051 --> 01:26:03,370
something even more so,

2890
01:26:03,720 --> 01:26:04,160
almost

2891
01:26:04,160 --> 01:26:06,020
motivates more movement.

2892
01:26:06,021 --> 01:26:08,660
Then the worst thing that can
ever happen to you is you win.

2893
01:26:08,661 --> 01:26:12,350
The lottery does win the lottery at 21.

2894
01:26:12,351 --> 01:26:12,891
He good luck.

2895
01:26:12,891 --> 01:26:13,480
Fuck face.

2896
01:26:13,480 --> 01:26:13,670
Yeah.

2897
01:26:13,670 --> 01:26:14,900
Never going to figure out shit.

2898
01:26:15,310 --> 01:26:17,510
You have $500 million and you're 21,

2899
01:26:17,511 --> 01:26:20,180
you're going to be a dummy for the rest
of your life and you have no opposing

2900
01:26:20,181 --> 01:26:22,280
force to apply your strength against.

2901
01:26:22,281 --> 01:26:24,200
There was something I've
read a yesterday or today,

2902
01:26:24,201 --> 01:26:24,650
earlier,

2903
01:26:24,650 --> 01:26:24,951
uh,

2904
01:26:24,951 --> 01:26:25,520
about,

2905
01:26:25,520 --> 01:26:25,850
uh,

2906
01:26:25,850 --> 01:26:26,720
the Prince of,

2907
01:26:26,721 --> 01:26:27,140
uh,

2908
01:26:27,140 --> 01:26:27,831
one of those,

2909
01:26:27,831 --> 01:26:28,130
uh,

2910
01:26:28,130 --> 01:26:32,660
Brunei or something like that
who pissed away $18 billion,

2911
01:26:33,110 --> 01:26:38,030
a teen billion dollars.

2912
01:26:38,270 --> 01:26:42,170
And that's what happens when
you're born with all that cash.

2913
01:26:42,350 --> 01:26:44,270
You can't figure that
shit out for yourself.

2914
01:26:44,300 --> 01:26:45,020
You're just,

2915
01:26:45,020 --> 01:26:46,040
you're not going to,

2916
01:26:46,310 --> 01:26:47,210
you're not going to,

2917
01:26:47,211 --> 01:26:47,511
it's,

2918
01:26:47,511 --> 01:26:49,880
they said you're at a disadvantage.

2919
01:26:50,510 --> 01:26:51,260
Yeah.

2920
01:26:51,260 --> 01:26:51,850
It's,

2921
01:26:51,850 --> 01:26:53,000
it's life.

2922
01:26:53,180 --> 01:26:54,590
You need struggle.

2923
01:26:54,640 --> 01:26:54,980
Yeah,

2924
01:26:54,980 --> 01:26:58,160
you need all of it and I
think that we as human race,

2925
01:26:58,370 --> 01:26:59,030
if the in the,

2926
01:26:59,030 --> 01:26:59,863
you know,

2927
01:27:00,320 --> 01:27:01,190
the macro,

2928
01:27:01,370 --> 01:27:04,700
you know from the microcosm of the
individual to the human race itself,

2929
01:27:04,790 --> 01:27:07,520
it almost seems like all
that stuff is necessary.

2930
01:27:07,880 --> 01:27:08,420
It almost,

2931
01:27:08,420 --> 01:27:09,231
I don't like it.

2932
01:27:09,231 --> 01:27:10,340
I don't like it in myself.

2933
01:27:10,341 --> 01:27:11,690
I don't like it in other people,

2934
01:27:12,350 --> 01:27:13,250
but it exists.

2935
01:27:13,400 --> 01:27:14,310
It's always existed.

2936
01:27:14,311 --> 01:27:16,010
It never been a day on
this planet without war.

2937
01:27:16,240 --> 01:27:16,580
What?

2938
01:27:16,580 --> 01:27:17,360
What is it?

2939
01:27:17,360 --> 01:27:18,560
What is it and what's going on.

2940
01:27:18,561 --> 01:27:18,951
Really,

2941
01:27:18,951 --> 01:27:22,310
if you were objective and you weren't
attached to the life and death of the

2942
01:27:22,311 --> 01:27:24,800
individuals that were a part
of this race would call humans.

2943
01:27:25,130 --> 01:27:27,290
If you weren't a part of that and
you were looking at it objectively,

2944
01:27:27,320 --> 01:27:30,440
if you were an alien from another
planet that wasn't even made of flesh,

2945
01:27:30,650 --> 01:27:31,280
you might be going,

2946
01:27:31,280 --> 01:27:31,461
oh,

2947
01:27:31,461 --> 01:27:32,121
I see what they're doing.

2948
01:27:32,121 --> 01:27:33,530
They're forcing themselves to move.

2949
01:27:34,130 --> 01:27:35,810
They're forcing themselves to do things.

2950
01:27:35,811 --> 01:27:38,120
They're battling over the
fucking blood of the earth.

2951
01:27:38,390 --> 01:27:41,750
They're forcing themselves
to accomplish more and more,

2952
01:27:41,760 --> 01:27:44,540
a amazing technological feat so
they can kill each other quicker.

2953
01:27:45,970 --> 01:27:49,910
They do with these crazy flux and the
whole while they're shitting out kids and

2954
01:27:49,911 --> 01:27:50,960
an alarming rate,

2955
01:27:51,320 --> 01:27:51,981
doubling,

2956
01:27:51,981 --> 01:27:54,500
tripling the population
like rats on a sinking ship,

2957
01:27:54,650 --> 01:27:56,930
hanging on to every Pete
of piece of floating wood.

2958
01:27:56,960 --> 01:27:57,890
They're nuts.

2959
01:27:58,070 --> 01:27:59,990
They're sucking all the
fish out of the ocean,

2960
01:28:00,110 --> 01:28:01,670
throwing all their shit into it.

2961
01:28:01,760 --> 01:28:02,780
They're fucking crazy.

2962
01:28:02,781 --> 01:28:03,614
What out of balance,

2963
01:28:03,930 --> 01:28:07,680
18 foot or fish has found
Alpha Catalina island today.

2964
01:28:07,740 --> 01:28:08,521
Oh my God.

2965
01:28:08,521 --> 01:28:09,350
It's dead.

2966
01:28:09,350 --> 01:28:09,760
Yeah.

2967
01:28:09,760 --> 01:28:11,100
Died of natural causes.

2968
01:28:11,490 --> 01:28:13,620
The three that the previous one,

2969
01:28:13,640 --> 01:28:17,050
longest one that the Aa have found
was I think three foot and says,

2970
01:28:17,220 --> 01:28:19,050
oh my God.

2971
01:28:19,330 --> 01:28:20,000
Yeah.

2972
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:21,200
Does it radioactive?

2973
01:28:21,230 --> 01:28:22,520
Did they check it for Fukushima?

2974
01:28:22,680 --> 01:28:23,513
I,

2975
01:28:23,540 --> 01:28:24,650
Holy Shit.

2976
01:28:24,651 --> 01:28:25,970
That's incredible.

2977
01:28:26,390 --> 01:28:26,541
Well,

2978
01:28:26,541 --> 01:28:29,570
they say there's a lot of fish that
just grow until something meets.

2979
01:28:29,571 --> 01:28:29,950
Um,

2980
01:28:29,950 --> 01:28:30,501
they just,

2981
01:28:30,501 --> 01:28:32,320
they don't really
necessarily have a lifespan.

2982
01:28:32,340 --> 01:28:33,680
They just keep going there.

2983
01:28:33,790 --> 01:28:35,870
It's not built in there because
you ain't got no chance.

2984
01:28:35,871 --> 01:28:36,740
Like good luck.

2985
01:28:36,800 --> 01:28:36,981
You know,

2986
01:28:36,981 --> 01:28:39,560
there's a leopard seals out there that
are looking for your ass seven days a

2987
01:28:39,561 --> 01:28:40,250
week.

2988
01:28:40,250 --> 01:28:42,350
You're not going to make
it so here live forever.

2989
01:28:43,730 --> 01:28:44,960
And some of them live forever.

2990
01:28:44,961 --> 01:28:46,040
I guess that guy did,

2991
01:28:46,130 --> 01:28:46,963
that guy's bad,

2992
01:28:47,080 --> 01:28:48,710
bad ass fish or fish

2993
01:28:48,810 --> 01:28:49,540
more fish.

2994
01:28:49,540 --> 01:28:52,630
Are you writing right now
or are you I never stopped.

2995
01:28:53,100 --> 01:28:55,380
You don't take a day off
after you complete a book or

2996
01:28:56,110 --> 01:28:56,621
uh,

2997
01:28:56,621 --> 01:28:58,000
I take days off but not,

2998
01:28:58,150 --> 01:29:02,010
I have a theory about finishing a book
and that is that you should start the

2999
01:29:02,010 --> 01:29:02,843
next one.

3000
01:29:02,940 --> 01:29:05,850
You should already have the
next one or the next two going.

3001
01:29:06,720 --> 01:29:09,150
Otherwise you fall into the abyss.

3002
01:29:09,210 --> 01:29:09,690
You know,

3003
01:29:09,690 --> 01:29:11,190
he nothing to talk about a bis.

3004
01:29:12,300 --> 01:29:12,571
Yeah.

3005
01:29:12,571 --> 01:29:13,020
Well,

3006
01:29:13,020 --> 01:29:17,880
I mean what I mean by that is you
resistance and negativity will come up and

3007
01:29:17,881 --> 01:29:19,830
you'll get over to your worst side.

3008
01:29:19,860 --> 01:29:20,610
You know?

3009
01:29:20,610 --> 01:29:22,110
So to me,

3010
01:29:22,111 --> 01:29:26,340
I've always got something going and
only when I've kind of established a

3011
01:29:26,341 --> 01:29:29,040
beachhead in a new project
when I kind of know him.

3012
01:29:29,041 --> 01:29:29,760
Okay,

3013
01:29:29,760 --> 01:29:31,200
then I'll take a little time off.

3014
01:29:31,400 --> 01:29:33,470
That's exactly the same
with standup comedy.

3015
01:29:33,650 --> 01:29:34,060
Ah.

3016
01:29:34,060 --> 01:29:34,550
How so?

3017
01:29:34,550 --> 01:29:38,870
When you produce a CD or a DVD or
a new special is what we call it.

3018
01:29:38,871 --> 01:29:41,450
We call it specials because of the way
they used to be like an HBO comedy,

3019
01:29:41,451 --> 01:29:44,390
Special News Call Your once it's over,

3020
01:29:44,480 --> 01:29:45,530
you throw that out.

3021
01:29:45,550 --> 01:29:47,090
Like I don't do any of
that material anymore.

3022
01:29:47,120 --> 01:29:50,180
I might do a one or two
bits on a request or if,

3023
01:29:50,181 --> 01:29:51,600
if it's poignant appointed,

3024
01:29:51,720 --> 01:29:52,100
I know,

3025
01:29:52,100 --> 01:29:53,750
but I'll even pointed
out that it's an old bit,

3026
01:29:54,020 --> 01:29:55,550
but from then on it's all new stuff.

3027
01:29:55,790 --> 01:29:58,790
So when I go into a new hour,

3028
01:29:59,000 --> 01:29:59,833
if I,

3029
01:29:59,840 --> 01:30:03,560
I have to scrounge up all
the shit that I'm ready to,

3030
01:30:03,680 --> 01:30:03,981
you know,

3031
01:30:03,981 --> 01:30:05,510
to really ready to piece together.

3032
01:30:05,690 --> 01:30:07,310
I have to have something already.

3033
01:30:07,370 --> 01:30:07,940
Uh,

3034
01:30:07,940 --> 01:30:11,780
so I have to have something that at least
I've attempted on stage or worked out

3035
01:30:11,781 --> 01:30:12,614
on paper.

3036
01:30:12,710 --> 01:30:16,250
I can't just go up raw and
clean and then finished,

3037
01:30:16,251 --> 01:30:17,840
finished my hour special and then go,

3038
01:30:17,841 --> 01:30:18,081
okay,

3039
01:30:18,081 --> 01:30:19,370
now all that material's done.

3040
01:30:19,520 --> 01:30:20,181
I have no idea.

3041
01:30:20,181 --> 01:30:21,200
What am I talking about next?

3042
01:30:21,201 --> 01:30:22,970
Like I always have a few things ready.

3043
01:30:23,420 --> 01:30:24,120
Same thing.

3044
01:30:24,120 --> 01:30:24,470
Yeah,

3045
01:30:24,470 --> 01:30:25,110
what you're saying.

3046
01:30:25,110 --> 01:30:25,943
Yeah.

3047
01:30:26,690 --> 01:30:27,201
How do you,

3048
01:30:27,201 --> 01:30:27,890
um,

3049
01:30:27,890 --> 01:30:31,460
how do you ration your
time off when you're,

3050
01:30:31,461 --> 01:30:32,181
when you're writing?

3051
01:30:32,181 --> 01:30:35,780
Do you just write until you feel
like you don't want to do it anymore?

3052
01:30:35,781 --> 01:30:36,021
Like,

3053
01:30:36,021 --> 01:30:36,231
do you,

3054
01:30:36,231 --> 01:30:37,850
do you have like a
specific amount of time?

3055
01:30:37,851 --> 01:30:39,320
Do you make yourself work every day?

3056
01:30:39,920 --> 01:30:41,180
I do work every day,

3057
01:30:41,690 --> 01:30:41,991
you know,

3058
01:30:41,991 --> 01:30:42,741
within reason.

3059
01:30:42,741 --> 01:30:42,951
I mean,

3060
01:30:42,951 --> 01:30:45,260
maybe I will work one day a
week or something like that,

3061
01:30:45,261 --> 01:30:45,530
but,

3062
01:30:45,530 --> 01:30:47,510
so six days a week I've found,

3063
01:30:47,511 --> 01:30:47,691
yeah.

3064
01:30:47,691 --> 01:30:47,901
And I,

3065
01:30:47,901 --> 01:30:48,930
if I could do seven,

3066
01:30:48,950 --> 01:30:49,760
I would do seven.

3067
01:30:49,760 --> 01:30:53,720
Sometimes I can do maybe 25 in
a row or something like that.

3068
01:30:53,721 --> 01:30:55,790
Even if I only do a little bit one day.

3069
01:30:56,140 --> 01:30:57,350
But I always try to look at something,

3070
01:30:57,420 --> 01:30:59,060
what's a little an hour
or something like that.

3071
01:30:59,300 --> 01:31:02,060
But I max out at about
four hours at that point.

3072
01:31:02,510 --> 01:31:03,980
When I start making mistakes,

3073
01:31:03,981 --> 01:31:05,300
when I start making typos,

3074
01:31:05,750 --> 01:31:06,920
then I know it's time to stop.

3075
01:31:06,970 --> 01:31:09,080
And then it's kind of like
working out at the gym.

3076
01:31:09,081 --> 01:31:11,000
You can push it too far and then you just,

3077
01:31:11,300 --> 01:31:11,571
you know,

3078
01:31:11,571 --> 01:31:12,620
diminishing returns,

3079
01:31:12,621 --> 01:31:13,454
starting to kick in.

3080
01:31:13,970 --> 01:31:14,803
But I do think,

3081
01:31:15,270 --> 01:31:15,560
you know,

3082
01:31:15,560 --> 01:31:19,550
physical fitness I think is a real
parallel to that to my experience of how I

3083
01:31:19,551 --> 01:31:20,360
work.

3084
01:31:20,360 --> 01:31:21,320
You know that you,

3085
01:31:22,100 --> 01:31:25,940
you can get out of shape and you
can work yourself back into shape.

3086
01:31:26,270 --> 01:31:27,380
And when I've been,

3087
01:31:27,410 --> 01:31:27,860
when,

3088
01:31:27,860 --> 01:31:30,050
when I'm working steadily on something,

3089
01:31:30,110 --> 01:31:32,120
I can work longer each day,

3090
01:31:32,870 --> 01:31:33,703
you know,

3091
01:31:33,710 --> 01:31:34,580
and when I haven't,

3092
01:31:34,760 --> 01:31:35,240
when I've,

3093
01:31:35,240 --> 01:31:36,410
when I haven't been working,

3094
01:31:36,770 --> 01:31:40,880
it's just like going to the gym or
trying to run or something you poop out,

3095
01:31:41,020 --> 01:31:41,270
you know,

3096
01:31:41,270 --> 01:31:42,200
you just don't have enough.

3097
01:31:42,530 --> 01:31:47,530
But I'm definitely a believer that the
muse comes around every day and she wants

3098
01:31:48,351 --> 01:31:50,270
to see you ready to go,

3099
01:31:50,271 --> 01:31:51,350
ready to rock and roll.

3100
01:31:51,370 --> 01:31:52,100
You know,

3101
01:31:52,100 --> 01:31:53,720
even if it's only for an hour,

3102
01:31:53,990 --> 01:31:54,260
you're,

3103
01:31:54,260 --> 01:31:55,093
you're

3104
01:31:55,100 --> 01:31:57,950
saint parallels comedy in
so many ways because you,

3105
01:31:57,960 --> 01:31:59,710
you get in comedy shape as well,

3106
01:31:59,980 --> 01:32:00,580
like standup,

3107
01:32:00,580 --> 01:32:02,170
standup comedy shape is real.

3108
01:32:02,171 --> 01:32:03,610
It's really critical to get to,

3109
01:32:03,640 --> 01:32:03,940
you can,

3110
01:32:03,940 --> 01:32:05,380
you can get along without it.

3111
01:32:05,650 --> 01:32:08,690
But I've had periods where I've
gotten that out of comic shade.

3112
01:32:08,691 --> 01:32:11,530
But even though I'm
capable of killing still,

3113
01:32:11,800 --> 01:32:13,510
there can be a moment where it just,

3114
01:32:13,540 --> 01:32:13,960
Ooh,

3115
01:32:13,960 --> 01:32:17,560
this is a little off and it's because
I'm not in comedy shape cause I'm not

3116
01:32:17,561 --> 01:32:19,630
doing comedy for five shows a week.

3117
01:32:19,960 --> 01:32:21,130
And if you're not doing for,

3118
01:32:21,310 --> 01:32:24,880
you don't want to do too much because if
you get too much it gets boring and you

3119
01:32:24,881 --> 01:32:26,380
don't want to ever get to that part.

3120
01:32:26,381 --> 01:32:29,140
So you want to keep the fun alive with it,

3121
01:32:29,290 --> 01:32:32,260
but you definitely want to keep it sharp
and when you want to keep it when it's

3122
01:32:32,261 --> 01:32:33,010
sharp,

3123
01:32:33,010 --> 01:32:35,950
then it's like a part of
your natural consciousness.

3124
01:32:35,950 --> 01:32:37,360
Like you plug right into it.

3125
01:32:37,540 --> 01:32:38,261
You don't go,

3126
01:32:38,261 --> 01:32:40,030
oh this is that thing that I used to do.

3127
01:32:40,031 --> 01:32:40,960
How's this go again?

3128
01:32:41,140 --> 01:32:42,660
It's just zip your,

3129
01:32:42,670 --> 01:32:43,990
your mind is firing.

3130
01:32:44,200 --> 01:32:46,210
And I think that applies
to writing as well.

3131
01:32:46,390 --> 01:32:48,880
I think that that getting
into that mindset and,

3132
01:32:48,900 --> 01:32:49,960
and when,

3133
01:32:49,961 --> 01:32:51,700
when you're there on a regular basis,

3134
01:32:51,701 --> 01:32:52,930
you get in writing shape,

3135
01:32:53,320 --> 01:32:53,591
you know?

3136
01:32:53,591 --> 01:32:56,230
And I think that that applies to Jujitsu.

3137
01:32:56,350 --> 01:32:56,801
I know.

3138
01:32:56,801 --> 01:32:58,090
I know it does to Jujitsu.

3139
01:32:58,120 --> 01:32:58,871
When I train,

3140
01:32:58,871 --> 01:33:01,000
if I'm not training on a
regular basis and I go train,

3141
01:33:01,001 --> 01:33:02,500
even if I'm physically in shape,

3142
01:33:02,800 --> 01:33:05,650
all that extra thinking that
I'm starting that I have to do.

3143
01:33:05,651 --> 01:33:07,780
If it's not coming completely natural,

3144
01:33:08,320 --> 01:33:08,950
it might.

3145
01:33:08,950 --> 01:33:09,970
It might look natural,

3146
01:33:09,971 --> 01:33:11,230
someone who's watching it,

3147
01:33:11,500 --> 01:33:14,350
but to me I'm thinking like an extra one,

3148
01:33:14,351 --> 01:33:16,330
eighth of a second more than I should be.

3149
01:33:16,600 --> 01:33:19,060
Whereas if I was in shape
I would be thinking at all,

3150
01:33:19,210 --> 01:33:19,541
I would.

3151
01:33:19,541 --> 01:33:20,740
When you're in doing Jujitsu,

3152
01:33:20,741 --> 01:33:22,060
it's just like doing comedy.

3153
01:33:22,061 --> 01:33:24,400
Just like writing where when you're in it,

3154
01:33:24,430 --> 01:33:25,030
you're in it,

3155
01:33:25,030 --> 01:33:25,990
you just flow,

3156
01:33:26,020 --> 01:33:28,840
everything moves together
and you're a passenger.

3157
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:30,100
You're just letting it all happen.

3158
01:33:30,101 --> 01:33:34,750
All your training sort of a manifest
itself in the the experience of rolling.

3159
01:33:35,370 --> 01:33:35,730
Go ahead.

3160
01:33:35,730 --> 01:33:36,780
Back to what you are saying,

3161
01:33:36,781 --> 01:33:37,010
Aubrey,

3162
01:33:37,010 --> 01:33:40,470
worry about seeing your higher
self and then your mind boy.

3163
01:33:41,070 --> 01:33:43,380
How would you apply that
to what Joe just said?

3164
01:33:43,710 --> 01:33:43,891
Well,

3165
01:33:43,891 --> 01:33:45,690
the mind boy wants to
think about everything.

3166
01:33:45,691 --> 01:33:45,991
Once the,

3167
01:33:45,991 --> 01:33:47,060
think about the moves,

3168
01:33:47,070 --> 01:33:47,910
plan it out,

3169
01:33:47,911 --> 01:33:51,270
think about your opponent or just be
distracted and think about what you're

3170
01:33:51,271 --> 01:33:54,600
going to do when you're finished rolling
or what you're going to do the next day

3171
01:33:54,601 --> 01:33:59,220
or about some old injury or something
like that and you need a kick that guy out

3172
01:33:59,420 --> 01:34:00,750
and roll with that.

3173
01:34:00,900 --> 01:34:01,733
That presence.

3174
01:34:01,790 --> 01:34:03,950
I play songs in my head when I'm rolling.

3175
01:34:04,140 --> 01:34:05,570
Like I'll sing the entire song.

3176
01:34:05,590 --> 01:34:05,730
Yeah,

3177
01:34:05,730 --> 01:34:06,351
distract,

3178
01:34:06,351 --> 01:34:07,280
distract the mind.

3179
01:34:07,281 --> 01:34:08,110
Boy.

3180
01:34:08,110 --> 01:34:09,050
Well I don't know what I'm,

3181
01:34:09,080 --> 01:34:09,980
sometimes it's random.

3182
01:34:11,270 --> 01:34:13,940
Sometimes they're
ridiculously silly songs,

3183
01:34:14,150 --> 01:34:14,630
you know,

3184
01:34:14,630 --> 01:34:18,110
and they'll just start playing in my
head and I'm going over it while I'm

3185
01:34:18,111 --> 01:34:20,660
rolling cause I won't allow
anything else in there.

3186
01:34:20,990 --> 01:34:22,480
I'm just like need Dee Dee,

3187
01:34:22,490 --> 01:34:24,170
Dee Dee Dee Dee is.

3188
01:34:24,230 --> 01:34:26,270
Especially if it's not a
life or death struggle.

3189
01:34:26,271 --> 01:34:26,811
Like you know,

3190
01:34:26,811 --> 01:34:28,620
you mount some money and
you got them pretty much,

3191
01:34:28,621 --> 01:34:30,980
you just got to cook them and you
got to wait until you can tap them.

3192
01:34:31,160 --> 01:34:33,770
When you're in that sort of
a situation like you can,

3193
01:34:33,771 --> 01:34:34,451
you can force it,

3194
01:34:34,451 --> 01:34:34,701
you know,

3195
01:34:34,701 --> 01:34:36,020
you could lose lose track.

3196
01:34:36,021 --> 01:34:40,670
So I fill up the part of my brain
is not required with a song.

3197
01:34:40,980 --> 01:34:41,810
Yeah,

3198
01:34:41,810 --> 01:34:42,111
yeah,

3199
01:34:42,111 --> 01:34:42,440
that's fine.

3200
01:34:42,440 --> 01:34:43,230
Mark Tactic.

3201
01:34:43,230 --> 01:34:44,330
That's a constant battle.

3202
01:34:44,331 --> 01:34:44,541
And,

3203
01:34:44,541 --> 01:34:45,350
and to me that,

3204
01:34:45,350 --> 01:34:45,561
you know,

3205
01:34:45,561 --> 01:34:47,900
I'm a big proponent of
the warrior kind of code,

3206
01:34:47,901 --> 01:34:49,850
the warrior philosophy and you know,

3207
01:34:49,851 --> 01:34:51,890
people think about that
in an external sense.

3208
01:34:51,891 --> 01:34:52,041
Like,

3209
01:34:52,041 --> 01:34:53,210
oh well what are you fighting?

3210
01:34:53,211 --> 01:34:53,931
Who are you fighting?

3211
01:34:53,931 --> 01:34:54,764
Who's your enemies?

3212
01:34:54,860 --> 01:34:56,660
Well that used to maybe make some sense,

3213
01:34:56,661 --> 01:34:58,100
but to me the warrior

3214
01:34:58,100 --> 01:34:58,610
is,

3215
01:34:58,610 --> 01:35:00,650
it's a constant battle with your own mind,

3216
01:35:00,680 --> 01:35:04,670
with the parasite of that part of your
mind that constantly wants to be active

3217
01:35:04,671 --> 01:35:05,270
and,

3218
01:35:05,270 --> 01:35:06,900
and that's why you're a wine boy.

3219
01:35:06,901 --> 01:35:07,611
You know the mind.

3220
01:35:07,611 --> 01:35:07,760
Yeah.

3221
01:35:07,760 --> 01:35:08,481
The mind boy,

3222
01:35:08,481 --> 01:35:11,240
the parasite is what the total techs
call it or there's a lot of different

3223
01:35:11,510 --> 01:35:11,840
things.

3224
01:35:11,840 --> 01:35:13,130
The inauthentic self,

3225
01:35:13,131 --> 01:35:13,311
you know,

3226
01:35:13,311 --> 01:35:15,140
you could put a lot of
different names on that,

3227
01:35:15,320 --> 01:35:18,170
but a warrior is someone who
fights against that resistance,

3228
01:35:18,171 --> 01:35:20,240
which is another aspect of your mind.

3229
01:35:20,400 --> 01:35:23,210
We know that was the
original term for jihad.

3230
01:35:23,540 --> 01:35:24,373
The real g,

3231
01:35:24,380 --> 01:35:29,380
the jihad originally was a fight against
your own vices and there was a fight

3232
01:35:29,841 --> 01:35:32,270
against your own weaknesses.

3233
01:35:32,460 --> 01:35:33,800
It became a holy war.

3234
01:35:33,801 --> 01:35:35,990
It was somewhere around the hijacked,

3235
01:35:36,500 --> 01:35:41,330
the Mujahideen and the Soviet Union
and the CIA somewhere around that area.

3236
01:35:41,331 --> 01:35:43,310
I don't know who caused it to change,

3237
01:35:43,580 --> 01:35:46,580
but then it became a term for a holy war.

3238
01:35:46,820 --> 01:35:50,400
But before it was a holy
war was a war against your,

3239
01:35:50,410 --> 01:35:51,800
your own self inadequacies.

3240
01:35:51,860 --> 01:35:54,440
And I think that's a war
that we wage every day.

3241
01:35:54,470 --> 01:35:54,861
Yeah.

3242
01:35:54,861 --> 01:35:55,131
You know,

3243
01:35:55,131 --> 01:35:56,060
and that's the key.

3244
01:35:56,061 --> 01:35:57,380
The key is deciding that,

3245
01:35:57,560 --> 01:35:58,070
okay,

3246
01:35:58,070 --> 01:36:02,810
I'm going to be a warrior and I'm not
going to accept that part of myself.

3247
01:36:02,811 --> 01:36:03,561
That is deficient.

3248
01:36:03,561 --> 01:36:04,394
That is lacking,

3249
01:36:04,490 --> 01:36:04,731
you know,

3250
01:36:04,731 --> 01:36:05,564
but still,

3251
01:36:05,870 --> 01:36:09,590
and another concept that
I think is important is to
have what I called ruthless

3252
01:36:09,591 --> 01:36:10,424
self love.

3253
01:36:10,610 --> 01:36:14,450
And that's just not this coddling
self love of a spoiling grandmother.

3254
01:36:14,570 --> 01:36:14,991
Oh yeah,

3255
01:36:14,991 --> 01:36:16,070
he eat the candy love.

3256
01:36:16,280 --> 01:36:17,660
It's that ruthless self love.

3257
01:36:17,661 --> 01:36:19,010
Like this is what's best for you.

3258
01:36:19,130 --> 01:36:20,810
I'm looking out for you long term.

3259
01:36:20,930 --> 01:36:25,040
I want you to thrive in your life and
I'm going to give you what you need to

3260
01:36:25,041 --> 01:36:26,660
thrive and nothing else.

3261
01:36:26,661 --> 01:36:27,090
You know,

3262
01:36:27,090 --> 01:36:28,190
love does not talk.

3263
01:36:28,200 --> 01:36:32,510
That nice self love is
to get up pussy shit.

3264
01:36:33,350 --> 01:36:34,270
It makes it a lot of noises.

3265
01:36:34,280 --> 01:36:35,113
Come on bitch.

3266
01:36:35,200 --> 01:36:36,033
Yeah.

3267
01:36:36,340 --> 01:36:37,010
That's why it's,

3268
01:36:37,010 --> 01:36:38,210
that's why it's ruthless,

3269
01:36:38,211 --> 01:36:38,780
you know?

3270
01:36:38,780 --> 01:36:39,770
But it's not cruel.

3271
01:36:39,920 --> 01:36:40,880
It's not going to be that.

3272
01:36:40,881 --> 01:36:41,601
It's not cruel.

3273
01:36:41,601 --> 01:36:43,340
It's not going to punish
you unnecessarily.

3274
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:43,701
Oh,

3275
01:36:43,701 --> 01:36:45,230
you fucking fat Slob,

3276
01:36:45,231 --> 01:36:47,660
you lazy piece of Shit can happen.

3277
01:36:47,661 --> 01:36:48,710
It can happen and then,

3278
01:36:48,760 --> 01:36:49,281
and that's,

3279
01:36:49,281 --> 01:36:50,480
and that's what you got to watch.

3280
01:36:50,481 --> 01:36:51,500
You've got to have that.

3281
01:36:51,540 --> 01:36:52,910
That's the self love part of it.

3282
01:36:52,911 --> 01:36:53,061
You know,

3283
01:36:53,061 --> 01:36:54,890
the ruthless is that intense.

3284
01:36:54,891 --> 01:36:55,880
Like come on,

3285
01:36:55,910 --> 01:36:56,340
do it,

3286
01:36:56,340 --> 01:36:56,600
you know,

3287
01:36:56,600 --> 01:36:57,050
get up,

3288
01:36:57,050 --> 01:36:57,883
get yourself.

3289
01:36:58,130 --> 01:36:59,180
This is what's best for you.

3290
01:36:59,181 --> 01:37:03,630
And then the self love part is not to
unnecessarily antagonize yourself because

3291
01:37:03,631 --> 01:37:05,210
we can be brutal to ourselves.

3292
01:37:05,390 --> 01:37:05,631
I mean,

3293
01:37:05,631 --> 01:37:06,200
who,

3294
01:37:06,200 --> 01:37:07,370
who would we allow?

3295
01:37:07,460 --> 01:37:09,730
Talk as much shit to ourselves as,

3296
01:37:09,731 --> 01:37:10,670
as ourselves.

3297
01:37:11,210 --> 01:37:11,550
You know,

3298
01:37:11,550 --> 01:37:12,230
nobody,

3299
01:37:12,230 --> 01:37:12,680
yeah.

3300
01:37:12,680 --> 01:37:14,050
I think this the um,

3301
01:37:14,090 --> 01:37:14,291
the,

3302
01:37:14,291 --> 01:37:17,750
the term self love is a funny one
because people do you love yourself?

3303
01:37:17,750 --> 01:37:18,583
Don't you?

3304
01:37:18,620 --> 01:37:19,940
You always knew you loved yourself.

3305
01:37:20,330 --> 01:37:20,961
You know people.

3306
01:37:20,961 --> 01:37:21,890
There's a weird thing about,

3307
01:37:22,070 --> 01:37:22,191
well,

3308
01:37:22,191 --> 01:37:23,120
if you don't love yourself,

3309
01:37:23,121 --> 01:37:24,590
why the fuck would anybody else love you?

3310
01:37:24,770 --> 01:37:28,640
You know you should be a a
person worthy of your own love.

3311
01:37:28,760 --> 01:37:29,690
And if you're not,

3312
01:37:29,691 --> 01:37:30,524
you're doing it wrong.

3313
01:37:30,680 --> 01:37:31,491
It's really that simple.

3314
01:37:31,491 --> 01:37:34,700
It doesn't mean worship yourself
doesn't mean a pretend the or something

3315
01:37:34,701 --> 01:37:35,031
awesome.

3316
01:37:35,031 --> 01:37:35,571
If you're not,

3317
01:37:35,571 --> 01:37:37,820
it means let yourself know
when you're not awesome.

3318
01:37:38,060 --> 01:37:41,300
Let yourself know everything you're
doing wrong and be completely honest with

3319
01:37:41,301 --> 01:37:41,930
yourself.

3320
01:37:41,930 --> 01:37:42,920
And until you do that,

3321
01:37:42,921 --> 01:37:43,850
you're doomed.

3322
01:37:44,240 --> 01:37:45,000
You're doomed,

3323
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:45,761
you're doomed.

3324
01:37:45,761 --> 01:37:46,670
You know how to get it right.

3325
01:37:46,940 --> 01:37:47,960
You'd never going to get it right.

3326
01:37:48,050 --> 01:37:50,540
If you don't look at yourself
the way other people look at you,

3327
01:37:50,690 --> 01:37:51,950
or even more harshly,

3328
01:37:52,100 --> 01:37:52,933
you're fucked.

3329
01:37:53,180 --> 01:37:53,690
And then,

3330
01:37:53,690 --> 01:37:56,070
and then the other component
is forgive yourself for

3331
01:37:56,070 --> 01:37:56,903
these past,

3332
01:37:56,990 --> 01:37:59,340
we'll rehash these old
things that we've done.

3333
01:37:59,341 --> 01:38:03,420
So many are past that
becomes new resistance,

3334
01:38:03,840 --> 01:38:07,650
these old past deeds that we're constantly
lashing ourselves like way to look at

3335
01:38:07,651 --> 01:38:07,771
it.

3336
01:38:07,771 --> 01:38:08,604
In my opinion.

3337
01:38:08,910 --> 01:38:12,090
It's just let yourself
know you are not the past.

3338
01:38:12,240 --> 01:38:16,290
You are who you are right now and you
could have fucked up your entire life,

3339
01:38:16,500 --> 01:38:19,590
but right now you wake up and the
way I always describe it to people,

3340
01:38:19,620 --> 01:38:23,790
pretend that you are a hero in your
own movie and the movie just started.

3341
01:38:23,791 --> 01:38:25,320
Now your life is in shambles.

3342
01:38:25,590 --> 01:38:26,870
What would the hero in the movie do?

3343
01:38:26,940 --> 01:38:28,440
A movie that you would want to go see?

3344
01:38:28,530 --> 01:38:29,363
What would happen?

3345
01:38:29,370 --> 01:38:30,630
How would you get your shit together?

3346
01:38:30,750 --> 01:38:32,340
How would the music start picking up?

3347
01:38:32,550 --> 01:38:33,360
How would it sounds?

3348
01:38:33,360 --> 01:38:37,170
It starts sounding like you know the
morning and waving at people smiling.

3349
01:38:37,171 --> 01:38:37,681
All of a sudden,

3350
01:38:37,681 --> 01:38:38,580
you know you're at the gym,

3351
01:38:38,581 --> 01:38:39,150
sweating it out.

3352
01:38:39,150 --> 01:38:41,940
You go through this whole montage of
scenes with this guy gets his shit

3353
01:38:41,941 --> 01:38:42,480
together.

3354
01:38:42,480 --> 01:38:43,500
Do all that dummy.

3355
01:38:44,130 --> 01:38:44,881
Do all that.

3356
01:38:44,881 --> 01:38:48,360
Be The hero in your own
movie and it starts now.

3357
01:38:48,450 --> 01:38:49,440
You can be a total Lou.

3358
01:38:49,441 --> 01:38:50,274
It doesn't matter.

3359
01:38:50,310 --> 01:38:53,250
That made the movie will be even
better when you turn it all around.

3360
01:38:53,430 --> 01:38:53,551
Yeah,

3361
01:38:53,551 --> 01:38:57,150
you used to be a total fucking loser
and a liar and a piece of shit.

3362
01:38:57,180 --> 01:38:58,590
You were fat and lying about it.

3363
01:38:58,760 --> 01:39:00,870
He had a fucking belly sucker on.

3364
01:39:00,930 --> 01:39:04,710
There's a reason they like Jared from
subway cause he was skinny as whole lot.

3365
01:39:04,790 --> 01:39:05,623
It's funny,

3366
01:39:06,070 --> 01:39:07,230
it's not Michael Phelps,

3367
01:39:07,320 --> 01:39:08,153
you know,

3368
01:39:08,220 --> 01:39:09,620
Jared from subway used to be a fat.

3369
01:39:09,621 --> 01:39:10,800
So that's the whole thing.

3370
01:39:11,070 --> 01:39:13,290
And I think going back
to you and your books,

3371
01:39:13,291 --> 01:39:16,920
that's one of the things that I found
really refreshing about your book is that

3372
01:39:16,921 --> 01:39:20,760
you were really honest about how you
felt about yourself at that time and that

3373
01:39:20,761 --> 01:39:22,350
you knew you needed to make changes.

3374
01:39:22,470 --> 01:39:26,730
And when people read that it
inspires people to get things moving.

3375
01:39:27,270 --> 01:39:28,350
Did you know you're going to do that?

3376
01:39:28,351 --> 01:39:28,591
When you,

3377
01:39:28,591 --> 01:39:29,520
when you made that book,

3378
01:39:29,521 --> 01:39:32,220
did you have any idea it was going to
have the kind of impact that it's had?

3379
01:39:32,320 --> 01:39:33,040
No,

3380
01:39:33,040 --> 01:39:33,850
not at all.

3381
01:39:33,850 --> 01:39:34,510
You know,

3382
01:39:34,510 --> 01:39:35,170
and the,

3383
01:39:35,170 --> 01:39:36,003
uh,

3384
01:39:36,220 --> 01:39:40,240
those little anecdotes that are
sort of storage on my shelf of like,

3385
01:39:40,270 --> 01:39:40,511
you know,

3386
01:39:40,511 --> 01:39:42,850
the most excruciating moments that it,

3387
01:39:43,570 --> 01:39:46,450
those are the things that
people respond to the most.

3388
01:39:46,480 --> 01:39:47,140
You know,

3389
01:39:47,140 --> 01:39:50,830
it's like the worst shit that
you could tell on yourself.

3390
01:39:51,130 --> 01:39:53,290
The more people can relate
to it because they've all,

3391
01:39:53,620 --> 01:39:56,050
we've all experienced
that same thing ourselves.

3392
01:39:56,380 --> 01:39:57,213
And uh,

3393
01:39:57,520 --> 01:39:58,001
but no,

3394
01:39:58,001 --> 01:39:58,280
I,

3395
01:39:58,280 --> 01:39:59,051
I didn't show,

3396
01:39:59,051 --> 01:39:59,741
I didn't have any,

3397
01:39:59,741 --> 01:40:04,741
but this thing has been out since 2002
and it's just slowly one book at a time

3398
01:40:06,041 --> 01:40:07,840
found its way into the,

3399
01:40:07,841 --> 01:40:08,490
into the,

3400
01:40:08,490 --> 01:40:10,230
well now that you were just on Oprah,

3401
01:40:10,290 --> 01:40:12,600
he's going to be on a lot
of other people very well.

3402
01:40:12,601 --> 01:40:14,760
That helps a little bit
young to Oprah and the mail.

3403
01:40:14,761 --> 01:40:16,980
Oh yeah.

3404
01:40:20,710 --> 01:40:21,001
Yeah.

3405
01:40:21,001 --> 01:40:23,460
I think that what you've done
is so important and it's,

3406
01:40:23,461 --> 01:40:24,900
it's helped me tremendously.

3407
01:40:25,530 --> 01:40:27,990
It's helped a lot of people that
I've put in contact with it.

3408
01:40:28,020 --> 01:40:30,900
And Aubrey for sure it probably
had something to do with him.

3409
01:40:31,140 --> 01:40:31,400
Uh,

3410
01:40:31,400 --> 01:40:32,340
starting up on it.

3411
01:40:32,950 --> 01:40:33,461
Many of these,

3412
01:40:33,461 --> 01:40:34,750
I mean even turning pro,

3413
01:40:34,780 --> 01:40:35,020
you know,

3414
01:40:35,020 --> 01:40:36,910
which is very analogous to the war of art.

3415
01:40:36,911 --> 01:40:38,950
And I actually wanted to ask you,

3416
01:40:38,951 --> 01:40:39,191
you know,

3417
01:40:39,191 --> 01:40:40,300
when recommending,

3418
01:40:40,550 --> 01:40:41,140
um,

3419
01:40:41,140 --> 01:40:42,670
between war of art and turning pro,

3420
01:40:42,671 --> 01:40:43,690
what are the distinctions?

3421
01:40:43,691 --> 01:40:47,710
But for me that that turning pro concept
was something that I bring with me,

3422
01:40:48,010 --> 01:40:48,400
you know,

3423
01:40:48,400 --> 01:40:49,210
every day,

3424
01:40:49,210 --> 01:40:49,481
you know,

3425
01:40:49,481 --> 01:40:50,230
it's like,

3426
01:40:50,230 --> 01:40:50,800
all right,

3427
01:40:50,800 --> 01:40:52,420
what is the pro dude today?

3428
01:40:52,450 --> 01:40:52,661
You know,

3429
01:40:52,661 --> 01:40:53,530
the pro in,

3430
01:40:53,531 --> 01:40:57,220
he doesn't screw around his check his
emails and look at his Facebook likes.

3431
01:40:57,221 --> 01:40:59,470
The pro goes in to the
meat of the problem,

3432
01:40:59,500 --> 01:40:59,861
you know?

3433
01:40:59,861 --> 01:41:03,490
And that helps me kind of
prioritize my day as you know,

3434
01:41:03,491 --> 01:41:04,540
CEO of the company.

3435
01:41:04,541 --> 01:41:07,000
And the other endeavors
that I have to do is like,

3436
01:41:07,330 --> 01:41:08,680
what is the pro do right now?

3437
01:41:08,710 --> 01:41:09,160
You know,

3438
01:41:09,160 --> 01:41:09,300
bro,

3439
01:41:09,300 --> 01:41:12,080
it's kind of like your
warrior contracts as well,

3440
01:41:12,081 --> 01:41:12,914
right?

3441
01:41:12,980 --> 01:41:13,813
What would he do?

3442
01:41:13,840 --> 01:41:14,530
Yeah.

3443
01:41:14,530 --> 01:41:15,160
Do it right.

3444
01:41:15,160 --> 01:41:15,371
I mean,

3445
01:41:15,371 --> 01:41:16,510
you don't have to do it wrong.

3446
01:41:16,511 --> 01:41:20,500
And that's one of the things that
we see in involved in politics.

3447
01:41:20,770 --> 01:41:22,510
It's one of the things that we see in,

3448
01:41:22,511 --> 01:41:25,900
in the corporate world and
the impact on the environment.

3449
01:41:25,901 --> 01:41:30,010
The corporations are having the impact
on societies that they're having by going

3450
01:41:30,011 --> 01:41:31,870
into third world countries
and setting up shop.

3451
01:41:31,871 --> 01:41:34,840
And you know what's going on in China
were where they're making iPhones and a

3452
01:41:34,841 --> 01:41:37,900
factor that has nets around it to keep
people from jumping off the fucking roof.

3453
01:41:38,440 --> 01:41:40,720
Like there's gotta be a
way to do this better.

3454
01:41:40,750 --> 01:41:41,171
You know,

3455
01:41:41,171 --> 01:41:45,280
somewhere along the line someone
put humanity out of the picture,

3456
01:41:45,430 --> 01:41:46,690
put morals out of the picture,

3457
01:41:46,691 --> 01:41:50,290
and took advantage of the diffusion of
responsibility that comes from people

3458
01:41:50,291 --> 01:41:53,920
acting in gigantic groups where they
don't feel responsible for their actions.

3459
01:41:53,950 --> 01:41:57,640
Each individual feels like they're a
part of something much bigger than them.

3460
01:41:57,730 --> 01:41:59,920
It's why people don't mind
throwing cigarettes out the window.

3461
01:41:59,921 --> 01:42:01,240
They don't even feel responsible.

3462
01:42:01,241 --> 01:42:02,890
They're not throwing a
cigarette in their own house.

3463
01:42:03,220 --> 01:42:03,641
Okay?

3464
01:42:03,641 --> 01:42:05,350
They're not throwing it on the
floor of their living room.

3465
01:42:05,470 --> 01:42:07,480
They're throwing a cigarette and then
someone else is going to deal with.

3466
01:42:07,481 --> 01:42:08,770
Those are plenty of people
out there that do that.

3467
01:42:08,800 --> 01:42:10,380
It's a diffusion of responses.

3468
01:42:10,430 --> 01:42:10,730
Billing.

3469
01:42:10,730 --> 01:42:11,563
Yeah,

3470
01:42:12,050 --> 01:42:12,540
sure.

3471
01:42:12,540 --> 01:42:13,530
Too many fucking people.

3472
01:42:14,640 --> 01:42:15,900
It all goes back to that.

3473
01:42:15,960 --> 01:42:17,370
We're not designed for this shit.

3474
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,880
So what do you think between
the war of art and turning pro?

3475
01:42:20,910 --> 01:42:21,121
You know,

3476
01:42:21,121 --> 01:42:22,470
when I'm recommending these books,

3477
01:42:22,471 --> 01:42:25,240
do you still recommend the war of
art or what are the distinctions for,

3478
01:42:25,241 --> 01:42:27,390
for different people who want
to read one of these books?

3479
01:42:28,030 --> 01:42:28,480
Well,

3480
01:42:28,480 --> 01:42:32,830
I think the war of art is probably
the one to read first because it was,

3481
01:42:32,831 --> 01:42:34,270
was written first for one thing,

3482
01:42:34,510 --> 01:42:39,510
but also it really sort of explains the
basic kind of principles of this theory,

3483
01:42:39,731 --> 01:42:40,660
whatever it is,

3484
01:42:41,050 --> 01:42:41,261
you know,

3485
01:42:41,261 --> 01:42:42,520
what is resistance?

3486
01:42:42,521 --> 01:42:43,690
What is an,

3487
01:42:43,750 --> 01:42:48,750
and turning pro is sort of the answer
my answer to how you deal with this

3488
01:42:48,911 --> 01:42:50,320
negative force in your life.

3489
01:42:50,321 --> 01:42:51,010
You know,

3490
01:42:51,010 --> 01:42:54,010
rather than blaming yourself or you know,

3491
01:42:54,190 --> 01:42:55,570
passing judgment on yourself,

3492
01:42:56,200 --> 01:42:59,110
switch from being an
amateur to being a pro,

3493
01:42:59,111 --> 01:43:02,350
which sort of takes the judgment out of
it all the self-condemnation out of it

3494
01:43:02,790 --> 01:43:03,623
so that,

3495
01:43:04,010 --> 01:43:04,240
you know,

3496
01:43:04,240 --> 01:43:06,670
turning pro would be kind
of the second one to read.

3497
01:43:06,700 --> 01:43:07,390
If God,

3498
01:43:07,390 --> 01:43:10,630
if anybody were asking me
why awesome or what order,

3499
01:43:10,790 --> 01:43:11,870
what about these books that you gave me?

3500
01:43:11,871 --> 01:43:12,740
Which one of those should I read?

3501
01:43:12,741 --> 01:43:13,061
For us.

3502
01:43:13,061 --> 01:43:13,761
Gates of fire,

3503
01:43:13,761 --> 01:43:14,500
tides of war,

3504
01:43:14,500 --> 01:43:15,250
uh,

3505
01:43:15,250 --> 01:43:16,083
gates of fire,

3506
01:43:16,090 --> 01:43:17,580
tides of war is very,

3507
01:43:17,660 --> 01:43:18,550
very difficult.

3508
01:43:18,670 --> 01:43:19,350
Read.

3509
01:43:19,350 --> 01:43:19,711
What are you saying?

3510
01:43:19,711 --> 01:43:20,161
I'm stupid.

3511
01:43:20,161 --> 01:43:21,010
My favorite book.

3512
01:43:21,390 --> 01:43:22,200
How dare you it,

3513
01:43:22,200 --> 01:43:23,310
but it's a

3514
01:43:25,110 --> 01:43:25,943
Fergal read.

3515
01:43:26,500 --> 01:43:26,710
Well,

3516
01:43:26,710 --> 01:43:28,020
I'll open it up and you'll see,

3517
01:43:28,050 --> 01:43:28,410
okay.

3518
01:43:28,410 --> 01:43:33,410
Is it just because of the period of
covers or the don't tell me period that it

3519
01:43:33,721 --> 01:43:36,030
covers is a really complex period.

3520
01:43:36,031 --> 01:43:37,050
And also it's a period,

3521
01:43:37,380 --> 01:43:38,213
it's like,

3522
01:43:39,030 --> 01:43:39,271
I don't know,

3523
01:43:39,271 --> 01:43:40,950
it feels sort of like a blowing,

3524
01:43:42,150 --> 01:43:42,810
I don't know.

3525
01:43:42,810 --> 01:43:43,450
But uh,

3526
01:43:43,450 --> 01:43:46,870
gates of fire is a really
simple story with a good,

3527
01:43:47,100 --> 01:43:47,311
you know,

3528
01:43:47,311 --> 01:43:51,290
good and evil and it's the kind of
story that Sykes people up and you're,

3529
01:43:51,291 --> 01:43:51,831
when you're done,

3530
01:43:51,831 --> 01:43:53,030
you're ready to go out and kill somebody.

3531
01:43:53,031 --> 01:43:53,660
You know?

3532
01:43:53,660 --> 01:43:54,650
And it's very,

3533
01:43:55,400 --> 01:43:57,230
it's a very popular book with a,

3534
01:43:57,260 --> 01:44:00,800
the Marine Corps and with elite military
units cause it's about kind of the

3535
01:44:00,801 --> 01:44:01,634
warrior ethos.

3536
01:44:02,270 --> 01:44:06,740
Whereas tides of war is a story that's
full of ambiguity and a characters are

3537
01:44:06,741 --> 01:44:08,810
not right and wrong.

3538
01:44:08,811 --> 01:44:10,730
A lot of people are very flawed.

3539
01:44:11,120 --> 01:44:12,740
A lot of bad stuff goes on.

3540
01:44:12,741 --> 01:44:14,180
So it's hard to kind of find,

3541
01:44:14,600 --> 01:44:15,381
you know,

3542
01:44:15,381 --> 01:44:15,831
a character.

3543
01:44:15,831 --> 01:44:17,030
You can really root for that.

3544
01:44:17,330 --> 01:44:21,650
But it's much more interesting
to me because it really
gets into the ambiguity's

3545
01:44:21,651 --> 01:44:22,484
of things,

3546
01:44:22,520 --> 01:44:24,800
which is the way the world really is.

3547
01:44:25,310 --> 01:44:26,143
Um,

3548
01:44:26,300 --> 01:44:28,130
so read gates of fire first,

3549
01:44:28,240 --> 01:44:29,260
let me ask you this then.

3550
01:44:29,261 --> 01:44:29,681
As a,

3551
01:44:29,681 --> 01:44:32,620
as an author and as a creative writer,

3552
01:44:32,650 --> 01:44:33,130
what is,

3553
01:44:33,130 --> 01:44:36,970
what is it about people
that want that good guy,

3554
01:44:37,090 --> 01:44:38,020
bad guy?

3555
01:44:38,021 --> 01:44:40,030
Although the Joseph Campbell stuff,

3556
01:44:40,040 --> 01:44:40,330
the,

3557
01:44:40,330 --> 01:44:40,571
you know,

3558
01:44:40,571 --> 01:44:40,801
the,

3559
01:44:40,801 --> 01:44:43,360
the ancient archetype or the ancient,

3560
01:44:43,361 --> 01:44:44,000
uh,

3561
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:44,470
uh,

3562
01:44:44,470 --> 01:44:45,360
structure of the,

3563
01:44:45,361 --> 01:44:46,350
the hero tail.

3564
01:44:46,450 --> 01:44:46,760
Huh?

3565
01:44:46,760 --> 01:44:49,400
I think that's exactly
Itchio because we're,

3566
01:44:49,670 --> 01:44:53,780
each of us is in a battle
with that internal monster,

3567
01:44:53,810 --> 01:44:55,610
whatever it is or in our,

3568
01:44:55,611 --> 01:44:56,391
in our real life.

3569
01:44:56,391 --> 01:44:58,790
And we're usually being
overwhelmed by that battle.

3570
01:44:59,090 --> 01:44:59,391
You know,

3571
01:44:59,391 --> 01:45:03,950
we don't understand what's going on or
where we're flagging in our passion for

3572
01:45:03,951 --> 01:45:04,340
it.

3573
01:45:04,340 --> 01:45:06,080
So if we can see a great movie,

3574
01:45:06,560 --> 01:45:06,891
you know,

3575
01:45:06,891 --> 01:45:08,090
where rocky comes out,

3576
01:45:08,120 --> 01:45:08,301
you know,

3577
01:45:08,301 --> 01:45:10,650
hangs in there against
Apollo creed or you know,

3578
01:45:10,730 --> 01:45:11,563
you name it,

3579
01:45:11,900 --> 01:45:14,390
we kind of come out of it and it's
kind of encouraged us and we say to

3580
01:45:14,391 --> 01:45:14,721
ourselves,

3581
01:45:14,721 --> 01:45:14,961
you know,

3582
01:45:14,961 --> 01:45:15,711
it is possible,

3583
01:45:15,711 --> 01:45:16,310
you know,

3584
01:45:16,310 --> 01:45:17,210
if I could suck it up,

3585
01:45:17,211 --> 01:45:17,601
if I could,

3586
01:45:17,601 --> 01:45:17,811
you know,

3587
01:45:17,811 --> 01:45:18,644
be like a,

3588
01:45:18,920 --> 01:45:19,220
you know,

3589
01:45:19,220 --> 01:45:20,090
like you were just saying,

3590
01:45:20,091 --> 01:45:21,830
be the hero of the movie of my life,

3591
01:45:21,831 --> 01:45:22,041
you know,

3592
01:45:22,041 --> 01:45:23,120
starting right now.

3593
01:45:23,540 --> 01:45:28,540
And it's why it's a harder sell to do
something that's more ambiguous and uh,

3594
01:45:30,050 --> 01:45:31,400
we like our fiction,

3595
01:45:31,401 --> 01:45:32,600
like with tidy endings.

3596
01:45:32,601 --> 01:45:35,510
Like no country for your off
for old man pissed me off.

3597
01:45:36,900 --> 01:45:37,733
Yeah.

3598
01:45:37,860 --> 01:45:38,611
In hindsight,

3599
01:45:38,611 --> 01:45:39,900
I loved the performances.

3600
01:45:39,901 --> 01:45:40,860
I love the story.

3601
01:45:40,861 --> 01:45:42,690
I love Tommy Lee Jones and w who's the,

3602
01:45:42,720 --> 01:45:43,431
the guy's name,

3603
01:45:43,431 --> 01:45:44,850
he played the psycho that,

3604
01:45:44,870 --> 01:45:46,320
that a Spanish gentleman.

3605
01:45:46,321 --> 01:45:46,770
Yeah,

3606
01:45:46,770 --> 01:45:47,341
whoever he is,

3607
01:45:47,341 --> 01:45:47,430
he,

3608
01:45:47,430 --> 01:45:47,580
oh,

3609
01:45:47,580 --> 01:45:48,390
he's awesome.

3610
01:45:48,390 --> 01:45:49,030
But it's,

3611
01:45:49,030 --> 01:45:50,580
it's an amazing movie.

3612
01:45:50,581 --> 01:45:51,181
And then the end,

3613
01:45:51,181 --> 01:45:51,481
you're like,

3614
01:45:51,481 --> 01:45:52,291
what the fuck?

3615
01:45:52,291 --> 01:45:53,124
Where's the,

3616
01:45:53,190 --> 01:45:54,420
why isn't the bad guy dead?

3617
01:45:54,421 --> 01:45:57,360
Why isn't the ending wrapped up that
why isn't the good guy walk off with the

3618
01:45:57,361 --> 01:45:57,930
girl?

3619
01:45:57,930 --> 01:45:59,190
What are you selling me?

3620
01:45:59,280 --> 01:46:00,090
You know,

3621
01:46:00,090 --> 01:46:02,880
I need to see happiness at the end.

3622
01:46:02,881 --> 01:46:03,714
I needed it to be.

3623
01:46:04,300 --> 01:46:07,390
I think that's one of the reasons we
liked the spartan so much is because you

3624
01:46:07,391 --> 01:46:09,790
know what the spartan
does it every choice.

3625
01:46:10,040 --> 01:46:15,040
There's this bracelet's WWJD which
is very ambiguous and confusing.

3626
01:46:15,191 --> 01:46:17,410
If you actually read the
Bible like who the hell knows?

3627
01:46:17,500 --> 01:46:17,891
But he does.

3628
01:46:17,891 --> 01:46:19,090
Sometimes he brings his sword.

3629
01:46:19,091 --> 01:46:19,960
Sometimes he doesn't.

3630
01:46:19,961 --> 01:46:20,770
I don't know.

3631
01:46:20,770 --> 01:46:22,930
But you know if you said
what would a spartan do?

3632
01:46:23,020 --> 01:46:24,160
The answer is simple.

3633
01:46:24,190 --> 01:46:25,230
You know the guy,

3634
01:46:25,540 --> 01:46:26,373
that's what they do.

3635
01:46:26,860 --> 01:46:27,693
Yes,

3636
01:46:28,330 --> 01:46:29,380
but you know the answer.

3637
01:46:29,381 --> 01:46:31,210
Say that a real Sparta.

3638
01:46:32,050 --> 01:46:32,201
Why?

3639
01:46:32,201 --> 01:46:32,800
What happens?

3640
01:46:32,800 --> 01:46:33,460
They get mad at you.

3641
01:46:33,460 --> 01:46:33,671
Yeah.

3642
01:46:33,671 --> 01:46:34,121
They don't like,

3643
01:46:34,121 --> 01:46:36,460
they don't like to live in
the reality of all that.

3644
01:46:36,970 --> 01:46:37,451
But you know,

3645
01:46:37,451 --> 01:46:39,640
for someone like you who
knows the Spartan Code,

3646
01:46:39,641 --> 01:46:41,020
you know the answer is pretty simple.

3647
01:46:41,021 --> 01:46:42,730
You could say what a spartan would do.

3648
01:46:42,731 --> 01:46:45,010
And each one of these situations,

3649
01:46:45,011 --> 01:46:49,060
and that some part of us is admires that
because we have such an ambiguous kind

3650
01:46:49,110 --> 01:46:49,770
life,

3651
01:46:49,770 --> 01:46:50,010
that

3652
01:46:50,010 --> 01:46:52,800
strict adherence to a code is,

3653
01:46:53,050 --> 01:46:56,140
well we do respond in
stories to archetypes,

3654
01:46:56,141 --> 01:46:56,370
right?

3655
01:46:56,370 --> 01:47:00,730
Right to the night or the Merlin like
character or something like that.

3656
01:47:01,150 --> 01:47:01,983
But of course,

3657
01:47:02,230 --> 01:47:02,891
and that's what we love.

3658
01:47:02,891 --> 01:47:04,870
That's why we love them and
stories that gun slinger,

3659
01:47:04,871 --> 01:47:05,351
whatever it is.

3660
01:47:05,351 --> 01:47:06,520
But of course in real life,

3661
01:47:06,970 --> 01:47:07,361
you know,

3662
01:47:07,361 --> 01:47:08,290
we're a little bit of this,

3663
01:47:08,330 --> 01:47:09,101
a little bit of that.

3664
01:47:09,101 --> 01:47:09,791
And you know,

3665
01:47:09,791 --> 01:47:10,624
it's not quite so

3666
01:47:10,780 --> 01:47:11,051
yeah,

3667
01:47:11,051 --> 01:47:13,090
we respond to the Samurai when we,

3668
01:47:13,091 --> 01:47:15,580
that's the one that everybody loves.

3669
01:47:15,670 --> 01:47:17,950
And when it comes to martial arts though,

3670
01:47:17,951 --> 01:47:18,784
the Ronan,

3671
01:47:18,910 --> 01:47:19,181
you know,

3672
01:47:19,181 --> 01:47:23,710
the one lone person who lives by a very
strict code and we like to watch them

3673
01:47:23,711 --> 01:47:26,410
practice because we like the watch
their discipline and you know,

3674
01:47:26,590 --> 01:47:28,120
like in every Steven Seagal movie,

3675
01:47:28,270 --> 01:47:30,310
that'd be a scene where he was practicing.

3676
01:47:30,520 --> 01:47:33,450
Like there's one where he's in a coma
for seven years and it gets out all

3677
01:47:33,451 --> 01:47:33,621
sudden.

3678
01:47:33,621 --> 01:47:36,730
He's fucking running up hills
and throwing punches in the Yang.

3679
01:47:36,731 --> 01:47:37,271
Like damn,

3680
01:47:37,271 --> 01:47:38,700
he's back practicing.

3681
01:47:38,710 --> 01:47:42,370
It's like leaving cigarettes out
that burn more time underwater.

3682
01:47:42,490 --> 01:47:43,670
Like Dude catching

3683
01:47:45,780 --> 01:47:50,780
that Samurai mindset that we know that
the Samurai will hold up in combat.

3684
01:47:51,461 --> 01:47:52,294
We know that they won't,

3685
01:47:52,600 --> 01:47:53,021
that their,

3686
01:47:53,021 --> 01:47:54,970
their character will be bulletproof.

3687
01:47:55,360 --> 01:47:56,530
They're not going to crumble.

3688
01:47:56,900 --> 01:47:57,150
Right.

3689
01:47:57,150 --> 01:47:57,690
What does that,

3690
01:47:57,690 --> 01:48:02,160
it's an inspiration to us and I
think why we like that Samurai,

3691
01:48:02,220 --> 01:48:03,510
I'm with you on that Joe.

3692
01:48:03,870 --> 01:48:08,460
It's a Samurai's an individual as opposed
to the spark and set or a group or

3693
01:48:08,461 --> 01:48:08,791
any,

3694
01:48:08,791 --> 01:48:09,121
you know,

3695
01:48:09,121 --> 01:48:10,020
other kinds of things.

3696
01:48:10,320 --> 01:48:13,470
And because we know that
we're alone in the world,

3697
01:48:13,540 --> 01:48:15,360
at least that's how I
experience the world.

3698
01:48:15,720 --> 01:48:20,580
And so when we can see the Samurai
train and have that discipline,

3699
01:48:20,581 --> 01:48:22,950
when there's nobody cracking
a whip over his head,

3700
01:48:23,340 --> 01:48:23,880
you know,

3701
01:48:23,880 --> 01:48:24,840
nobody's paying him.

3702
01:48:24,841 --> 01:48:26,040
Nobody's patting him on the back.

3703
01:48:26,041 --> 01:48:28,440
Nobody's encouraging and
he's doing it all entirely.

3704
01:48:28,670 --> 01:48:29,640
Self discipline,

3705
01:48:29,641 --> 01:48:30,570
self generated,

3706
01:48:30,571 --> 01:48:31,500
self reinforce,

3707
01:48:31,501 --> 01:48:32,600
self validating.

3708
01:48:32,820 --> 01:48:34,920
That's very inspiring
to us because we say,

3709
01:48:34,921 --> 01:48:35,430
well shit,

3710
01:48:35,430 --> 01:48:35,671
you know,

3711
01:48:35,671 --> 01:48:36,504
maybe I can,

3712
01:48:36,600 --> 01:48:37,051
I can do it.

3713
01:48:37,051 --> 01:48:38,730
And I can tell from talking to you guys,

3714
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:40,500
that's how you live your lives.

3715
01:48:40,501 --> 01:48:41,100
You know,

3716
01:48:41,100 --> 01:48:43,530
we try to fight that internal
battle from the morning.

3717
01:48:43,531 --> 01:48:46,140
You wake up in the minute you
wake up through the whole day.

3718
01:48:46,500 --> 01:48:47,490
One of the things I like to,

3719
01:48:47,491 --> 01:48:49,470
I like to train myself,

3720
01:48:49,710 --> 01:48:50,110
I'm like,

3721
01:48:50,110 --> 01:48:51,630
I write down like,

3722
01:48:51,660 --> 01:48:55,230
oh I have a workout routine or write down
all the things that have to get done.

3723
01:48:55,440 --> 01:48:55,711
You know,

3724
01:48:55,711 --> 01:48:57,120
this is all that's
going to get done today,

3725
01:48:57,390 --> 01:48:57,870
period.

3726
01:48:57,870 --> 01:48:58,710
This is going to get done.

3727
01:48:58,711 --> 01:48:59,040
You know,

3728
01:48:59,040 --> 01:49:01,080
x amount of kettle bell swings,

3729
01:49:01,081 --> 01:49:02,100
x amount of Chin ups,

3730
01:49:02,101 --> 01:49:04,380
x amount of squats and
you're going to do all that.

3731
01:49:04,410 --> 01:49:05,000
It's not going to,

3732
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:08,070
you're not going to say enough already.

3733
01:49:08,190 --> 01:49:09,150
I don't allow myself,

3734
01:49:09,330 --> 01:49:12,150
so I trained myself so I'll write
all that stuff down and then I do it.

3735
01:49:12,300 --> 01:49:14,790
But I love that I can motivate myself,

3736
01:49:14,940 --> 01:49:17,790
that I don't need anybody yelling
at me to get all this stuff done.

3737
01:49:17,970 --> 01:49:18,391
That's a,

3738
01:49:18,391 --> 01:49:21,150
that's very important and I
think when you could do that,

3739
01:49:21,151 --> 01:49:22,380
like it's so daunting.

3740
01:49:22,410 --> 01:49:26,110
The beginning is so daunting
looking at that piece of paper.

3741
01:49:26,220 --> 01:49:27,300
Do all that shit.

3742
01:49:28,460 --> 01:49:29,640
Like right now I'm comfortable.

3743
01:49:29,641 --> 01:49:30,474
I don't want to do that.

3744
01:49:30,570 --> 01:49:32,340
And then when you just say ready,

3745
01:49:32,490 --> 01:49:34,260
go and then force yourself,

3746
01:49:34,280 --> 01:49:34,750
it's,

3747
01:49:34,750 --> 01:49:36,660
it's the ability to create movement,

3748
01:49:36,661 --> 01:49:37,650
the ability to create,

3749
01:49:37,651 --> 01:49:37,820
uh,

3750
01:49:37,820 --> 01:49:38,370
uh,

3751
01:49:38,370 --> 01:49:39,600
to accomplish goals.

3752
01:49:39,870 --> 01:49:40,680
Like that's a,

3753
01:49:40,680 --> 01:49:42,000
that's an exercise that's uh,

3754
01:49:42,150 --> 01:49:43,200
something that you exercise.

3755
01:49:43,230 --> 01:49:44,220
Just like creativity,

3756
01:49:44,221 --> 01:49:45,390
just like your ability to write.

3757
01:49:45,420 --> 01:49:47,010
And if the stakes are high too,

3758
01:49:47,350 --> 01:49:47,980
when you actually

3759
01:49:47,980 --> 01:49:49,180
succeed and you do it,

3760
01:49:49,181 --> 01:49:52,780
you start to build that personal
power in that knowing that you can put

3761
01:49:52,781 --> 01:49:54,070
something down and you will do it.

3762
01:49:54,310 --> 01:49:56,830
But then if you pull up short or
you cheat yourself a little bit,

3763
01:49:56,831 --> 01:49:59,260
you start to build the other
ad didn't quite make ah,

3764
01:49:59,261 --> 01:49:59,831
it's okay.

3765
01:49:59,831 --> 01:50:00,101
You know,

3766
01:50:00,101 --> 01:50:00,934
you start to get that,

3767
01:50:01,030 --> 01:50:06,030
that weasely Nis about your easily and
then so the stakes are higher than just

3768
01:50:06,341 --> 01:50:06,911
that workout.

3769
01:50:06,911 --> 01:50:08,740
If you go out and set out to do something,

3770
01:50:09,040 --> 01:50:09,250
you know,

3771
01:50:09,250 --> 01:50:10,000
you better,

3772
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:11,170
you better damn do it.

3773
01:50:11,260 --> 01:50:11,561
You know,

3774
01:50:11,561 --> 01:50:12,010
at the end.

3775
01:50:12,010 --> 01:50:14,890
I actually had an experience today and
I'd like to play these games with myself

3776
01:50:14,891 --> 01:50:15,011
too.

3777
01:50:15,011 --> 01:50:16,360
Sometimes it's a full workout.

3778
01:50:16,600 --> 01:50:17,770
Sometimes it's just a set.

3779
01:50:17,771 --> 01:50:18,310
And I know,

3780
01:50:18,310 --> 01:50:19,600
cause we were doing this podcast,

3781
01:50:19,601 --> 01:50:22,510
I was thinking back to the warrior
ethos and I know one of the things the

3782
01:50:22,511 --> 01:50:24,800
Spartans had to do was they
had to run a marathon with a,

3783
01:50:25,160 --> 01:50:25,750
uh,

3784
01:50:25,750 --> 01:50:29,350
a mouthful of water and then they had
to spit the water back out at the end of

3785
01:50:29,351 --> 01:50:30,184
the marathon.

3786
01:50:30,340 --> 01:50:30,581
Right.

3787
01:50:30,581 --> 01:50:32,080
And that was hard training thing.

3788
01:50:32,081 --> 01:50:32,770
So I was like,

3789
01:50:32,770 --> 01:50:33,760
I've never tried that.

3790
01:50:33,761 --> 01:50:35,950
That seems like it'd be really hard to do.

3791
01:50:35,951 --> 01:50:37,320
So I set up the treadmill,

3792
01:50:37,350 --> 01:50:37,930
you know,

3793
01:50:37,930 --> 01:50:41,890
aid and aid and I was doing it to Bata
Protocol and which is 20 seconds of

3794
01:50:41,891 --> 01:50:43,480
sprinting and then 10 seconds.

3795
01:50:43,510 --> 01:50:43,790
Right.

3796
01:50:43,790 --> 01:50:44,920
Do that with a mouth.

3797
01:50:44,921 --> 01:50:45,550
Yeah.

3798
01:50:45,550 --> 01:50:47,860
That's on a marathon marathon thing.

3799
01:50:47,930 --> 01:50:48,950
I can have a marathon,

3800
01:50:49,220 --> 01:50:49,861
the way hards,

3801
01:50:49,861 --> 01:50:51,050
we're running a full marathon.

3802
01:50:51,070 --> 01:50:52,240
It was that,

3803
01:50:52,280 --> 01:50:54,560
I would think it'd be way
harder to do what you're doing.

3804
01:50:54,800 --> 01:50:55,261
Yeah,

3805
01:50:55,261 --> 01:50:56,080
it was,

3806
01:50:56,080 --> 01:50:56,913
well it was,

3807
01:50:56,990 --> 01:50:57,611
and it was,

3808
01:50:57,611 --> 01:50:59,410
and it was a real mentally,

3809
01:50:59,411 --> 01:51:00,690
it was hard to celebrate.

3810
01:51:00,970 --> 01:51:01,331
Yeah.

3811
01:51:01,331 --> 01:51:01,481
Well,

3812
01:51:01,481 --> 01:51:03,990
I said I was going to do around
if I was going to do five Ah,

3813
01:51:04,300 --> 01:51:05,860
and at three I was like,

3814
01:51:06,010 --> 01:51:06,340
wow,

3815
01:51:06,340 --> 01:51:09,850
if I just drank a little bit
of this water more comfortable,

3816
01:51:09,851 --> 01:51:10,151
and I said,

3817
01:51:10,151 --> 01:51:10,481
no,

3818
01:51:10,481 --> 01:51:11,314
like you can't.

3819
01:51:11,470 --> 01:51:12,310
You can't do that.

3820
01:51:12,311 --> 01:51:13,600
And then at the very end though,

3821
01:51:13,630 --> 01:51:17,710
so I finished my five and the idea was
to spit the water back out and then I

3822
01:51:17,711 --> 01:51:18,470
thought to myself,

3823
01:51:18,470 --> 01:51:18,760
ah,

3824
01:51:18,760 --> 01:51:19,061
fuck it.

3825
01:51:19,061 --> 01:51:20,020
I don't want to spit the water back.

3826
01:51:20,021 --> 01:51:20,500
I'll just,

3827
01:51:20,500 --> 01:51:21,221
I'll just drink it.

3828
01:51:21,221 --> 01:51:22,300
And as soon as I drunk it,

3829
01:51:22,330 --> 01:51:23,163
I knew like

3830
01:51:23,920 --> 01:51:26,590
I missed that little bit of my regimen,

3831
01:51:26,620 --> 01:51:26,880
you know?

3832
01:51:26,880 --> 01:51:28,240
So I cheated myself.

3833
01:51:28,360 --> 01:51:30,370
Have a little bit of what that goal was,

3834
01:51:30,371 --> 01:51:34,050
was to run the five and spit the water
back out this water that you're just,

3835
01:51:35,140 --> 01:51:35,890
let me help you out here.

3836
01:51:35,890 --> 01:51:36,790
That's silly shit.

3837
01:51:36,930 --> 01:51:38,320
You did what you're supposed to do.

3838
01:51:38,350 --> 01:51:39,580
The drinking the water at the end,

3839
01:51:39,581 --> 01:51:40,480
you deserve that water.

3840
01:51:42,730 --> 01:51:44,020
You're absolutely right.

3841
01:51:44,930 --> 01:51:46,870
You get a drink water eventually anyway.

3842
01:51:48,040 --> 01:51:49,570
You're not depriving yourself of water.

3843
01:51:49,810 --> 01:51:53,980
The exercise is to get through the
exercise with my mouth full of water.

3844
01:51:54,340 --> 01:51:55,180
They're drinking the water,

3845
01:51:55,730 --> 01:51:56,471
the other side,

3846
01:51:56,471 --> 01:51:57,110
Joe,

3847
01:51:57,110 --> 01:52:00,520
your shed to spit the water out the next
time when you do split the water out,

3848
01:52:00,760 --> 01:52:02,740
you'll feel and then you're going
to get another drink of water.

3849
01:52:02,741 --> 01:52:03,574
There's a fucking drought.

3850
01:52:03,850 --> 01:52:05,410
Why would you do that
as a drought going on?

3851
01:52:05,411 --> 01:52:05,800
It's a drink.

3852
01:52:05,800 --> 01:52:06,633
The fucking water.

3853
01:52:07,030 --> 01:52:07,661
That's ridiculous.

3854
01:52:07,661 --> 01:52:08,710
Unless you spit into the glass,

3855
01:52:08,711 --> 01:52:10,180
then just drink it and
then you're an idiot.

3856
01:52:10,490 --> 01:52:11,510
Why don't I just drink it straight?

3857
01:52:11,511 --> 01:52:12,380
He cut out the middleman.

3858
01:52:12,430 --> 01:52:13,263
It's in your mouth or rhythm.

3859
01:52:14,210 --> 01:52:16,720
Long as you get silly argument

3860
01:52:19,370 --> 01:52:19,870
for awhile,

3861
01:52:19,870 --> 01:52:22,690
but isn't it funny though that
you recognize that there is,

3862
01:52:22,720 --> 01:52:23,200
there's,

3863
01:52:23,200 --> 01:52:26,410
there's a thing about cutting
corners that's really dangerous.

3864
01:52:26,590 --> 01:52:27,670
Cutting corners in life,

3865
01:52:27,671 --> 01:52:30,250
settling in life is fucking dangerous.

3866
01:52:30,470 --> 01:52:31,780
It'll lead to the,

3867
01:52:31,870 --> 01:52:33,310
it's the road to mediocrity.

3868
01:52:33,340 --> 01:52:34,690
Let me ask you guys both here.

3869
01:52:34,750 --> 01:52:37,660
Was there a moment for you in your life,

3870
01:52:37,760 --> 01:52:42,760
your lives when you
understood this or it's just,

3871
01:52:42,971 --> 01:52:43,804
in other words,

3872
01:52:44,170 --> 01:52:46,010
did you not understand this at

3873
01:52:46,010 --> 01:52:49,880
a certain point or have this concept
and then you suddenly learned it?

3874
01:52:50,210 --> 01:52:55,210
I learned it slowly but surely through
a lifetime of struggle and failure and

3875
01:52:56,180 --> 01:52:58,970
some success and every
success cling to it.

3876
01:52:59,030 --> 01:53:02,450
Like it's a new log that you found after
you were swimming in the ocean to the

3877
01:53:02,451 --> 01:53:03,620
point where you thought
you're going to drown.

3878
01:53:03,621 --> 01:53:04,101
Then boom,

3879
01:53:04,101 --> 01:53:04,934
you find a log.

3880
01:53:05,100 --> 01:53:05,690
Okay,

3881
01:53:05,690 --> 01:53:06,321
we got something.

3882
01:53:06,321 --> 01:53:06,591
Okay,

3883
01:53:06,591 --> 01:53:10,640
ready and then jump off that log and keep
going and make yourself to another log

3884
01:53:10,641 --> 01:53:11,870
that slowly but surely,

3885
01:53:11,871 --> 01:53:15,560
I accumulated all this information
along with a lot of books,

3886
01:53:15,740 --> 01:53:16,880
a lot of documentaries,

3887
01:53:16,940 --> 01:53:19,580
a lot of talking to people
that I found inspirational,

3888
01:53:19,581 --> 01:53:21,470
a lot of martial arts,

3889
01:53:21,500 --> 01:53:22,410
a lot of uh,

3890
01:53:22,820 --> 01:53:26,400
talking to instructors that explained
like what it's about to get through it,

3891
01:53:26,401 --> 01:53:27,380
a hard training session,

3892
01:53:27,381 --> 01:53:28,910
what it's about to
achieve your black belt,

3893
01:53:29,060 --> 01:53:30,620
what it's about to be a champion,

3894
01:53:30,621 --> 01:53:34,190
what it's about to hit the
highest levels and competing.

3895
01:53:34,430 --> 01:53:35,510
Competing was a big one.

3896
01:53:35,720 --> 01:53:38,480
Competing in martial arts
as a boy shaped my brain,

3897
01:53:38,510 --> 01:53:40,130
shaped who I am as a human being.

3898
01:53:40,520 --> 01:53:44,870
You cannot have any bullshit when
you're throwing your bones at people,

3899
01:53:45,200 --> 01:53:45,851
when you're,

3900
01:53:45,851 --> 01:53:48,440
you're in involved in whatever it is.

3901
01:53:48,441 --> 01:53:51,650
With some other trained killer and you're
both really good at knocking people

3902
01:53:51,690 --> 01:53:52,940
unconscious and you,

3903
01:53:53,100 --> 01:53:53,360
you're,

3904
01:53:53,360 --> 01:53:55,130
you're planning on doing it to each other,

3905
01:53:55,131 --> 01:53:55,970
ready go,

3906
01:53:56,510 --> 01:53:57,343
you know your,

3907
01:53:57,370 --> 01:53:59,040
your brain does not accept any bullshit.

3908
01:53:59,060 --> 01:54:03,320
You have to know exactly who you are
and you have to have a very objective

3909
01:54:03,321 --> 01:54:05,150
assessment of your abilities.

3910
01:54:05,151 --> 01:54:06,620
Otherwise you're going to get brained.

3911
01:54:06,980 --> 01:54:10,070
You know you're going to get a bone is
going to bounce off your head and you're

3912
01:54:10,071 --> 01:54:10,920
going to get concussed.

3913
01:54:11,150 --> 01:54:15,830
It's like very real consequence that
very rarely faces you in everyday life.

3914
01:54:15,831 --> 01:54:18,250
The choices you make very
rarely get you cussed.

3915
01:54:18,530 --> 01:54:20,570
But when the goal is for
someone to knock you out,

3916
01:54:20,571 --> 01:54:21,351
like that's their goal.

3917
01:54:21,351 --> 01:54:24,350
They're trying really hard to do it
and you know that that's the goal.

3918
01:54:24,351 --> 01:54:28,910
Like it's like one of the
worst consequences you can
get in everyday life other

3919
01:54:28,911 --> 01:54:29,744
than dying.

3920
01:54:29,990 --> 01:54:30,231
You know,

3921
01:54:30,231 --> 01:54:30,371
it's,

3922
01:54:30,371 --> 01:54:31,490
it's a really hard one.

3923
01:54:31,880 --> 01:54:32,691
Your own health,

3924
01:54:32,691 --> 01:54:33,830
your own consciousness,

3925
01:54:33,950 --> 01:54:35,120
you can get knocked the fuck out.

3926
01:54:35,270 --> 01:54:40,270
So that reality I think forced me at a
very early age to just cut the bullshit.

3927
01:54:41,420 --> 01:54:42,470
Don't cut corners,

3928
01:54:42,471 --> 01:54:44,210
look at exactly what it is.

3929
01:54:44,450 --> 01:54:45,980
Do everything you have to do.

3930
01:54:45,981 --> 01:54:47,960
And also along the lines,

3931
01:54:47,990 --> 01:54:50,030
learning that every time I didn't,

3932
01:54:50,180 --> 01:54:53,360
I felt terrible and that I felt weak.

3933
01:54:53,650 --> 01:54:54,530
I felt if I didn't,

3934
01:54:54,620 --> 01:54:54,810
well,

3935
01:54:54,810 --> 01:54:55,760
I wasn't in shape.

3936
01:54:55,761 --> 01:54:56,870
I felt pathetic.

3937
01:54:56,900 --> 01:54:57,561
Like if I didn't,

3938
01:54:57,561 --> 01:55:01,610
if I got tired in a match and
that's why I lost it was unbearable,

3939
01:55:01,640 --> 01:55:02,480
unbearable,

3940
01:55:02,481 --> 01:55:05,420
just this stink on me
just would never wash off,

3941
01:55:05,450 --> 01:55:06,200
you know?

3942
01:55:06,200 --> 01:55:07,033
So that's,

3943
01:55:07,400 --> 01:55:08,200
that's where I learned

3944
01:55:08,200 --> 01:55:09,190
good answer for me.

3945
01:55:09,191 --> 01:55:10,590
I'm still learning every,

3946
01:55:10,650 --> 01:55:11,483
every day.

3947
01:55:11,530 --> 01:55:11,651
Oh,

3948
01:55:11,651 --> 01:55:12,200
me too.

3949
01:55:12,200 --> 01:55:12,370
Yeah,

3950
01:55:12,370 --> 01:55:12,761
definitely.

3951
01:55:12,761 --> 01:55:13,151
Me Too.

3952
01:55:13,151 --> 01:55:13,930
It's like,

3953
01:55:13,930 --> 01:55:14,231
you know,

3954
01:55:14,231 --> 01:55:16,990
you think you know and you think you get
it and then all of a sudden you'll be

3955
01:55:16,991 --> 01:55:18,400
on this weird path and you'd be like,

3956
01:55:18,730 --> 01:55:20,980
how did I forget so much just now?

3957
01:55:21,730 --> 01:55:22,840
Where am I?

3958
01:55:22,841 --> 01:55:25,360
What is this strange
place I find myself in?

3959
01:55:25,361 --> 01:55:27,340
And you have to research
it on my beautiful house.

3960
01:55:28,330 --> 01:55:30,820
You have to retrace your
steps back and realize that,

3961
01:55:30,960 --> 01:55:31,390
you know,

3962
01:55:31,390 --> 01:55:32,590
things go in cycles,

3963
01:55:32,591 --> 01:55:32,831
you know,

3964
01:55:32,831 --> 01:55:34,240
where it's at the top of the cycle.

3965
01:55:34,241 --> 01:55:36,280
You may feel like you have a good grasp,

3966
01:55:36,281 --> 01:55:40,870
but then you'll swing back down again
to some lesser state of forgetfulness,

3967
01:55:40,871 --> 01:55:41,560
really,

3968
01:55:41,560 --> 01:55:42,760
where you have to learn that,

3969
01:55:42,990 --> 01:55:43,261
you know,

3970
01:55:43,261 --> 01:55:46,260
relearn some things back and be
reminded of some other things.

3971
01:55:46,261 --> 01:55:47,340
But for me,

3972
01:55:47,400 --> 01:55:48,450
I think the process,

3973
01:55:48,451 --> 01:55:52,260
one of the defining moments for me
actually happened from a movie when this

3974
01:55:52,261 --> 01:55:54,660
process was actually when
I saw brave heart as a kid.

3975
01:55:54,990 --> 01:55:56,880
I remember at that point,

3976
01:55:56,881 --> 01:56:01,881
it really like struck me that the
impracticality of going through all that

3977
01:56:02,521 --> 01:56:05,100
torture just to say the word freedom,

3978
01:56:05,460 --> 01:56:05,850
you know,

3979
01:56:05,850 --> 01:56:06,511
and I started,

3980
01:56:06,511 --> 01:56:08,310
I kind of kind of got,

3981
01:56:08,670 --> 01:56:09,180
I was like,

3982
01:56:09,180 --> 01:56:11,670
well I kinda got that there was something,

3983
01:56:11,700 --> 01:56:11,971
you know,

3984
01:56:11,971 --> 01:56:15,510
something else that some other kind
of level that you could push yourself

3985
01:56:15,511 --> 01:56:15,930
through.

3986
01:56:15,930 --> 01:56:18,480
And I remember I would go running and
before I would work out and stuff,

3987
01:56:18,481 --> 01:56:19,261
I was an active kid.

3988
01:56:19,261 --> 01:56:21,180
I love playing around and
loved every sport I could,

3989
01:56:21,330 --> 01:56:21,961
martial arts,

3990
01:56:21,961 --> 01:56:22,680
whatever.

3991
01:56:22,680 --> 01:56:26,520
But I was running on the beach and
normally when I would have stopped,

3992
01:56:26,521 --> 01:56:27,510
I just didn't stop.

3993
01:56:27,570 --> 01:56:28,200
And I was like,

3994
01:56:28,200 --> 01:56:29,490
William Wallace wouldn't have said.

3995
01:56:30,530 --> 01:56:31,560
And saw

3996
01:56:33,130 --> 01:56:36,660
some part of me then like some
little inkling just planted.

3997
01:56:36,661 --> 01:56:37,030
And then,

3998
01:56:37,030 --> 01:56:37,530
uh,

3999
01:56:37,530 --> 01:56:38,550
I know many other things,

4000
01:56:38,551 --> 01:56:39,211
many books,

4001
01:56:39,211 --> 01:56:40,050
many teachers,

4002
01:56:40,051 --> 01:56:40,950
many internal thing.

4003
01:56:41,190 --> 01:56:43,020
Carlos cast the native played a big part.

4004
01:56:43,260 --> 01:56:43,770
Um,

4005
01:56:43,770 --> 01:56:44,011
you know,

4006
01:56:44,011 --> 01:56:45,170
some of the Toltec beliefs,

4007
01:56:45,171 --> 01:56:47,010
so many other different things.

4008
01:56:47,011 --> 01:56:47,251
You know,

4009
01:56:47,251 --> 01:56:48,440
your book meeting,

4010
01:56:48,441 --> 01:56:48,610
right

4011
01:56:48,610 --> 01:56:53,490
Joe through the immediate people right
now guaranteed or listening to this and

4012
01:56:53,491 --> 01:56:53,881
they're going,

4013
01:56:53,881 --> 01:56:54,151
fuck,

4014
01:56:54,151 --> 01:56:55,050
I gotta get my shit together.

4015
01:56:55,710 --> 01:56:57,780
And just that sometimes is all you need.

4016
01:56:57,781 --> 01:57:01,380
Just need a little spark
and then nurture that spark,

4017
01:57:01,530 --> 01:57:02,670
turn into a fire.

4018
01:57:02,970 --> 01:57:04,830
And that's really what it is.

4019
01:57:04,831 --> 01:57:05,664
It's like we,

4020
01:57:06,030 --> 01:57:07,620
Hunter Thompson had a great,

4021
01:57:07,670 --> 01:57:09,690
I saved it on my phone because,

4022
01:57:09,691 --> 01:57:09,900
uh,

4023
01:57:09,900 --> 01:57:10,130
I,

4024
01:57:10,130 --> 01:57:14,250
I read it online the other day and
it's so poignant and beautiful,

4025
01:57:14,430 --> 01:57:15,900
but it was about his,

4026
01:57:15,901 --> 01:57:16,270
uh,

4027
01:57:16,270 --> 01:57:19,500
the quote was about music and about,

4028
01:57:19,501 --> 01:57:19,860
uh,

4029
01:57:19,860 --> 01:57:23,970
some people say that
music is a inspiration,

4030
01:57:24,210 --> 01:57:28,380
but what he says is he says
what they really mean is fuel.

4031
01:57:28,800 --> 01:57:30,360
And that I've always needed fuel.

4032
01:57:30,361 --> 01:57:32,460
I'm a serious consumer on some nights.

4033
01:57:32,461 --> 01:57:36,480
I still believe that a car with the gas
needle on empty can run about 50 more

4034
01:57:36,481 --> 01:57:38,430
miles if you have the right music,

4035
01:57:38,431 --> 01:57:39,630
very loud on the radio,

4036
01:57:40,500 --> 01:57:40,921
you know,

4037
01:57:40,921 --> 01:57:42,360
and there's something about that.

4038
01:57:42,900 --> 01:57:45,570
I find that not just in music,

4039
01:57:45,630 --> 01:57:47,830
but in conversations
like this that I could,

4040
01:57:47,831 --> 01:57:49,680
if I could download this
and let's do it as podcast.

4041
01:57:49,800 --> 01:57:50,850
If I were in a part of it,

4042
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:52,200
I'd be so fucking psyched.

4043
01:57:52,470 --> 01:57:54,150
And the same thing about your book,

4044
01:57:54,151 --> 01:57:55,140
I found it through your book.

4045
01:57:55,141 --> 01:57:57,540
I found it through certain
songs I found through movies.

4046
01:57:57,780 --> 01:58:01,230
I found it through
performances of a musicians,

4047
01:58:01,231 --> 01:58:02,220
comedians,

4048
01:58:02,260 --> 01:58:02,981
everything.

4049
01:58:02,981 --> 01:58:03,251
It's,

4050
01:58:03,251 --> 01:58:03,510
it's,

4051
01:58:03,510 --> 01:58:05,040
it exists everywhere around us.

4052
01:58:05,041 --> 01:58:07,290
And so it's all saw sparks,

4053
01:58:07,440 --> 01:58:08,211
it's all sparked.

4054
01:58:08,211 --> 01:58:10,260
He grabbed those sparks
and you make your own fire.

4055
01:58:12,220 --> 01:58:12,670
That's it.

4056
01:58:12,670 --> 01:58:13,750
What are you still learning,

4057
01:58:13,830 --> 01:58:14,663
Steve?

4058
01:58:14,710 --> 01:58:15,543
Same stuff.

4059
01:58:15,850 --> 01:58:16,430
Same stuff.

4060
01:58:16,430 --> 01:58:16,960
Never.

4061
01:58:16,960 --> 01:58:17,793
Never stops.

4062
01:58:18,130 --> 01:58:19,870
And I'm thinking listening to you guys,

4063
01:58:19,871 --> 01:58:20,111
I mean,

4064
01:58:20,111 --> 01:58:22,540
my experience was not like
in martial arts or something.

4065
01:58:22,541 --> 01:58:22,811
I've got,

4066
01:58:22,811 --> 01:58:24,280
it was more in,

4067
01:58:24,310 --> 01:58:27,040
in writing day to day of,

4068
01:58:27,280 --> 01:58:29,050
would I fuck off today?

4069
01:58:29,250 --> 01:58:30,010
You know,

4070
01:58:30,010 --> 01:58:31,510
would I drop the ball today?

4071
01:58:31,511 --> 01:58:32,291
Would I stop?

4072
01:58:32,291 --> 01:58:32,501
You know,

4073
01:58:32,501 --> 01:58:33,160
or like Abra,

4074
01:58:33,160 --> 01:58:35,050
you were saying you'd running
a little farther on the beach.

4075
01:58:35,051 --> 01:58:37,240
Like what would we have
Mollis do you know?

4076
01:58:37,510 --> 01:58:38,020
Um,

4077
01:58:38,020 --> 01:58:39,790
can I push myself a little farther?

4078
01:58:40,060 --> 01:58:43,870
Or even the idea of like whipping
yourself or anything like that.

4079
01:58:43,871 --> 01:58:44,790
The idea of like,

4080
01:58:44,791 --> 01:58:45,310
um,

4081
01:58:45,310 --> 01:58:46,340
being kind to yourself,

4082
01:58:46,350 --> 01:58:47,350
be gentle to yourself.

4083
01:58:47,351 --> 01:58:50,080
Like if you're training
a thoroughbred racehorse,

4084
01:58:50,260 --> 01:58:52,120
you're not going to beat
the crap out of that horse.

4085
01:58:52,121 --> 01:58:53,440
You're going to make
it fun for that horse.

4086
01:58:53,441 --> 01:58:53,740
Right?

4087
01:58:53,740 --> 01:58:54,220
Right.

4088
01:58:54,220 --> 01:58:55,660
So to do that,

4089
01:58:55,661 --> 01:58:56,530
and like you were saying,

4090
01:58:56,531 --> 01:58:56,791
Jill,

4091
01:58:56,791 --> 01:58:57,100
you,

4092
01:58:57,100 --> 01:58:59,140
you find a log that's floating.

4093
01:58:59,710 --> 01:59:00,250
You know,

4094
01:59:00,250 --> 01:59:01,840
this worked today.

4095
01:59:01,841 --> 01:59:02,770
I did this,

4096
01:59:02,800 --> 01:59:04,900
it worked here in is the end of the day.

4097
01:59:04,901 --> 01:59:05,734
I feel good.

4098
01:59:05,890 --> 01:59:08,410
So tomorrow let me try to do that again.

4099
01:59:08,440 --> 01:59:08,950
Right?

4100
01:59:08,950 --> 01:59:09,760
And then you don't,

4101
01:59:09,760 --> 01:59:10,840
you don't quite succeed,

4102
01:59:10,841 --> 01:59:11,350
you know,

4103
01:59:11,350 --> 01:59:15,790
but then you find another log and little
by little you put those logs together

4104
01:59:16,330 --> 01:59:19,090
and truth start to form in
your mind or this works,

4105
01:59:19,091 --> 01:59:20,020
this doesn't work.

4106
01:59:20,380 --> 01:59:21,820
And then also like you guys say,

4107
01:59:21,821 --> 01:59:22,840
you get it from other people.

4108
01:59:22,841 --> 01:59:23,710
You get it from books,

4109
01:59:23,711 --> 01:59:24,910
you get it from conversations,

4110
01:59:24,911 --> 01:59:25,750
you get it from music.

4111
01:59:26,020 --> 01:59:27,310
It reinforces itself.

4112
01:59:27,311 --> 01:59:30,010
Like this conversation now
is reinforcing it for me.

4113
01:59:30,310 --> 01:59:32,170
And I'm sure it's reinforcing
it for you guys too.

4114
01:59:32,590 --> 01:59:37,090
It's like what's interesting to me is it
doesn't matter what pursuit you're in,

4115
01:59:37,420 --> 01:59:39,880
the laws seem to be the same.

4116
01:59:40,450 --> 01:59:41,200
You know,

4117
01:59:41,200 --> 01:59:42,740
I'm sure that if we had a,

4118
01:59:42,770 --> 01:59:43,360
uh,

4119
01:59:43,360 --> 01:59:47,290
a weaver in here or a potter or somebody,

4120
01:59:47,291 --> 01:59:47,711
you know,

4121
01:59:47,711 --> 01:59:49,000
that made furniture,

4122
01:59:49,210 --> 01:59:50,740
they would say the exact same thing.

4123
01:59:50,741 --> 01:59:50,981
You know,

4124
01:59:50,981 --> 01:59:54,910
I get a piece of wood in and that piece
of wood is telling me it wants to be a

4125
01:59:54,911 --> 01:59:55,740
couch,

4126
01:59:55,740 --> 01:59:56,290
you know?

4127
01:59:56,290 --> 01:59:57,123
Um,

4128
01:59:58,330 --> 02:00:00,580
so it's interesting that there,

4129
02:00:00,850 --> 02:00:05,590
there are laws and we're just sort of
learning them and uncovering them as we

4130
02:00:05,591 --> 02:00:05,830
go.

4131
02:00:05,830 --> 02:00:06,221
And again,

4132
02:00:06,221 --> 02:00:10,120
this is what Musashi spoke of and this
is one of the things that Musashi,

4133
02:00:10,140 --> 02:00:10,973
um,

4134
02:00:11,780 --> 02:00:16,000
put put in his book where he
described his pursuit of calligraphy,

4135
02:00:16,210 --> 02:00:17,950
his pursuit of poetry,

4136
02:00:18,050 --> 02:00:18,261
right.

4137
02:00:18,261 --> 02:00:19,094
There are

4138
02:00:19,830 --> 02:00:20,990
disciplines in,

4139
02:00:21,060 --> 02:00:22,200
in a pursuit of,

4140
02:00:22,201 --> 02:00:23,900
of when you're writing poetry,

4141
02:00:23,910 --> 02:00:26,070
when you're drawing something
or painting something,

4142
02:00:26,250 --> 02:00:29,040
you're still trying to
get at that same source,

4143
02:00:29,041 --> 02:00:30,360
that pure source,

4144
02:00:30,790 --> 02:00:31,740
whatever it is,

4145
02:00:31,950 --> 02:00:36,950
whether it's a cartoon or whether it's
a Steven Pressfield novel about Greek

4146
02:00:36,961 --> 02:00:37,794
history,

4147
02:00:37,980 --> 02:00:38,761
whatever it is,

4148
02:00:38,761 --> 02:00:39,810
it's the same thing.

4149
02:00:39,811 --> 02:00:40,530
It's like,

4150
02:00:40,530 --> 02:00:44,220
it's this weird creating energy
that you're trying to tap in.

4151
02:00:44,520 --> 02:00:47,220
It's getting rid of that mind
boy and getting it to the,

4152
02:00:47,221 --> 02:00:47,720
uh,

4153
02:00:47,720 --> 02:00:49,410
the higher nobler set.

4154
02:00:50,230 --> 02:00:50,950
What's the,

4155
02:00:50,950 --> 02:00:52,120
what the fuck is the mind boy?

4156
02:00:52,121 --> 02:00:54,330
Therefore though is he doesn't
need do something good.

4157
02:00:54,410 --> 02:00:55,600
He's good at solving puzzles,

4158
02:00:55,930 --> 02:00:56,621
is what he's good at.

4159
02:00:56,621 --> 02:00:57,281
He's good at pool.

4160
02:00:57,281 --> 02:00:57,800
Is He,

4161
02:00:57,800 --> 02:00:59,020
is he what makes you play pool?

4162
02:00:59,080 --> 02:00:59,891
He's not going to pull it,

4163
02:00:59,891 --> 02:01:00,470
but he's good.

4164
02:01:00,470 --> 02:01:00,890
He's gonna,

4165
02:01:00,890 --> 02:01:01,810
he's gonna doing,

4166
02:01:01,811 --> 02:01:02,110
you know,

4167
02:01:02,110 --> 02:01:02,760
doing the,

4168
02:01:02,760 --> 02:01:05,980
the mechanistic puzzle
work of the human life,

4169
02:01:06,010 --> 02:01:06,371
you know,

4170
02:01:06,371 --> 02:01:07,510
figuring things out,

4171
02:01:07,660 --> 02:01:09,040
putting on different masks,

4172
02:01:09,100 --> 02:01:10,480
socially adapting,

4173
02:01:10,600 --> 02:01:11,260
you know,

4174
02:01:11,260 --> 02:01:13,360
modifying behavior in a certain way.

4175
02:01:13,540 --> 02:01:18,100
I was call that the ego as opposed to
the shelf shelf with the capital Ash.

4176
02:01:18,130 --> 02:01:18,461
You know,

4177
02:01:18,461 --> 02:01:19,294
it's the,

4178
02:01:19,720 --> 02:01:20,381
it's in,

4179
02:01:20,381 --> 02:01:25,381
maybe we're talking about tribal ways and
and seeing those mysterious worlds and

4180
02:01:25,901 --> 02:01:26,471
all that other thing.

4181
02:01:26,471 --> 02:01:30,760
Maybe that's the self and
somehow when we became civilized,

4182
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:36,000
we shrunk it down to to the ego that knows
how to build a wall or something like

4183
02:01:37,421 --> 02:01:39,440
that but doesn't know how to access.

4184
02:01:40,160 --> 02:01:41,430
And then what,

4185
02:01:41,750 --> 02:01:45,230
what you guys are talking about when I'm
talking about is breaking through those

4186
02:01:45,231 --> 02:01:49,670
walls and trying to get even for
just a minute at a time to that,

4187
02:01:50,330 --> 02:01:52,190
that thing that's got some magic to it.

4188
02:01:52,920 --> 02:01:53,251
Yeah.

4189
02:01:53,251 --> 02:01:56,040
Creating and I feel bad for
people who don't get it create.

4190
02:01:56,130 --> 02:01:56,963
I really do.

4191
02:01:57,230 --> 02:01:59,040
Whether W I mean even if it's creating,

4192
02:01:59,041 --> 02:02:00,270
like at your job,

4193
02:02:00,540 --> 02:02:00,781
you know,

4194
02:02:00,781 --> 02:02:01,201
whether you're a,

4195
02:02:01,201 --> 02:02:03,090
you're a carpenter or you know,

4196
02:02:03,091 --> 02:02:04,760
someone who puts things together.

4197
02:02:04,770 --> 02:02:08,640
Like there's something about making
something that wasn't there before and now

4198
02:02:08,641 --> 02:02:09,240
it's there.

4199
02:02:09,240 --> 02:02:10,200
There's something about that,

4200
02:02:10,201 --> 02:02:12,390
whether it's even just a
performance or you know,

4201
02:02:12,391 --> 02:02:13,410
a song or whatever.

4202
02:02:13,560 --> 02:02:14,490
There's something about that.

4203
02:02:14,491 --> 02:02:16,860
That's one of the few
magical things in life.

4204
02:02:16,910 --> 02:02:17,071
Well,

4205
02:02:17,071 --> 02:02:17,570
let's,

4206
02:02:17,570 --> 02:02:18,740
what God does,

4207
02:02:19,040 --> 02:02:19,640
right?

4208
02:02:19,640 --> 02:02:20,570
Allegedly create.

4209
02:02:20,660 --> 02:02:23,270
So we as human beings when we can do that,

4210
02:02:23,840 --> 02:02:24,673
that's pretty cool.

4211
02:02:24,740 --> 02:02:24,891
Yeah.

4212
02:02:24,891 --> 02:02:26,540
But you're also creates nuclear bombs,

4213
02:02:26,990 --> 02:02:27,321
you know,

4214
02:02:27,321 --> 02:02:29,600
creating also meant what Oppenheimer did,

4215
02:02:29,630 --> 02:02:29,961
you know,

4216
02:02:29,961 --> 02:02:30,920
it's all creating.

4217
02:02:30,950 --> 02:02:31,260
That's,

4218
02:02:31,260 --> 02:02:32,360
that's creating as well.

4219
02:02:32,361 --> 02:02:36,260
So it's a very strange thing that what
you drop out of the Enola gay that kills

4220
02:02:36,261 --> 02:02:37,370
a half a million people.

4221
02:02:37,430 --> 02:02:38,780
That's creative too.

4222
02:02:39,970 --> 02:02:40,803
It's kind of implied.

4223
02:02:40,850 --> 02:02:42,020
It's almost there.

4224
02:02:42,021 --> 02:02:44,780
That destructive force is also part of,

4225
02:02:44,810 --> 02:02:45,151
you know,

4226
02:02:45,151 --> 02:02:46,340
is part of the creation.

4227
02:02:46,370 --> 02:02:46,671
You know,

4228
02:02:46,671 --> 02:02:47,920
I was talking to someone who,

4229
02:02:48,170 --> 02:02:50,270
who I really respect and
I was asking him about,

4230
02:02:50,630 --> 02:02:50,871
you know,

4231
02:02:50,871 --> 02:02:51,704
that kind of,

4232
02:02:51,950 --> 02:02:52,580
um,

4233
02:02:52,580 --> 02:02:53,920
the demon force,

4234
02:02:54,070 --> 02:02:56,000
that purely destructive force.

4235
02:02:56,180 --> 02:02:58,760
And it doesn't have to be
an actual angel or demon,

4236
02:02:58,761 --> 02:02:59,031
you know,

4237
02:02:59,031 --> 02:03:00,830
kind of conceptualize religiously,

4238
02:03:01,040 --> 02:03:03,440
but whatever that destructive forces,

4239
02:03:03,441 --> 02:03:04,280
it's tapped in and,

4240
02:03:04,640 --> 02:03:05,840
and he's basically saying that,

4241
02:03:05,841 --> 02:03:06,081
you know,

4242
02:03:06,081 --> 02:03:07,430
when that's really high,

4243
02:03:07,431 --> 02:03:07,910
it's just,

4244
02:03:07,910 --> 02:03:09,260
it's just doing its job.

4245
02:03:09,380 --> 02:03:09,830
You know,

4246
02:03:09,830 --> 02:03:11,180
there has to be that,

4247
02:03:11,540 --> 02:03:15,470
that opposing force from which
creation can push forward.

4248
02:03:15,471 --> 02:03:16,304
It's strength,

4249
02:03:16,460 --> 02:03:16,821
you know?

4250
02:03:16,821 --> 02:03:17,750
And so yeah,

4251
02:03:17,751 --> 02:03:18,081
these,

4252
02:03:18,081 --> 02:03:21,710
these nuclear bombs do it in
a dramatic and terrifying way.

4253
02:03:22,100 --> 02:03:25,520
But that's one opposing
force by which you know,

4254
02:03:25,521 --> 02:03:27,890
you can try and flourish life in spite of,

4255
02:03:27,891 --> 02:03:28,131
you know,

4256
02:03:28,131 --> 02:03:30,770
so there's some kind of weird harmony in,

4257
02:03:30,771 --> 02:03:33,860
in all of that that was created
in the soup to begin with.

4258
02:03:33,920 --> 02:03:34,131
You know,

4259
02:03:34,131 --> 02:03:36,500
everything has to be find the balance,

4260
02:03:36,501 --> 02:03:41,501
but I do think that we get way off balance
one way or the other in certain ass.

4261
02:03:41,641 --> 02:03:42,620
And you see that in people.

4262
02:03:42,621 --> 02:03:43,940
And I think the key is,

4263
02:03:43,970 --> 02:03:44,803
you know,

4264
02:03:44,870 --> 02:03:45,830
you can really only,

4265
02:03:45,831 --> 02:03:47,330
there's only one corner of the universe.

4266
02:03:47,780 --> 02:03:48,980
You can be sure to change.

4267
02:03:48,981 --> 02:03:50,660
And I think that's a quote from,

4268
02:03:50,661 --> 02:03:51,080
uh,

4269
02:03:51,080 --> 02:03:52,130
from Huxley actually.

4270
02:03:52,430 --> 02:03:55,270
And that's yourself and that's
what you can be sure to change.

4271
02:03:55,271 --> 02:03:56,990
So bringing yourself back into balance,

4272
02:03:57,260 --> 02:03:58,520
everybody does that.

4273
02:03:58,730 --> 02:03:59,420
Guess what?

4274
02:03:59,420 --> 02:04:00,680
The world's back in balance,

4275
02:04:00,920 --> 02:04:01,161
you know,

4276
02:04:01,161 --> 02:04:02,210
so you can be sure,

4277
02:04:02,390 --> 02:04:02,601
you know,

4278
02:04:02,601 --> 02:04:05,030
take that step to get yourself in balance.

4279
02:04:05,270 --> 02:04:08,930
And then slowly all these other things
will start to lay out the dominoes.

4280
02:04:08,931 --> 02:04:09,260
Will,

4281
02:04:09,260 --> 02:04:12,010
I want to ask you a
question about writing.

4282
02:04:12,190 --> 02:04:16,150
Do you have when you start
writing and you have an idea,

4283
02:04:16,370 --> 02:04:19,420
like I'm reading Stephen
King's book on writing.

4284
02:04:19,450 --> 02:04:20,283
It's really interesting.

4285
02:04:20,450 --> 02:04:20,630
Yeah,

4286
02:04:20,630 --> 02:04:21,251
really good book.

4287
02:04:21,251 --> 02:04:21,371
Yeah.

4288
02:04:21,371 --> 02:04:24,430
And one of the things that he said that
I found was incredibly fascinating is

4289
02:04:24,431 --> 02:04:27,040
that he doesn't make a
plot before he gets going.

4290
02:04:27,220 --> 02:04:28,570
He might have some ideas,

4291
02:04:28,810 --> 02:04:31,060
but he creates the characters.

4292
02:04:31,390 --> 02:04:32,200
He uh,

4293
02:04:32,200 --> 02:04:36,550
he starts writing their dialogue and
then what they do is up to them and then

4294
02:04:36,551 --> 02:04:36,760
say,

4295
02:04:36,760 --> 02:04:37,950
shit just goes down.

4296
02:04:38,160 --> 02:04:38,461
And,

4297
02:04:38,461 --> 02:04:42,000
which is incredible when you think about
the plots of someone's Stephen King's

4298
02:04:42,001 --> 02:04:42,301
books,

4299
02:04:42,301 --> 02:04:44,790
especially with the
gunslinger and you know,

4300
02:04:44,791 --> 02:04:46,650
the state what you,

4301
02:04:46,680 --> 02:04:47,940
that just came out of your head.

4302
02:04:47,941 --> 02:04:49,360
Like you didn't even plot that out.

4303
02:04:49,361 --> 02:04:50,370
But that's crazy.

4304
02:04:50,850 --> 02:04:52,410
Do you plot your stuff out?

4305
02:04:52,411 --> 02:04:56,370
Do you have like a cork board where you
put like index cards on it and you move

4306
02:04:56,371 --> 02:04:57,480
them around or how do you,

4307
02:04:57,510 --> 02:04:58,343
how do you write?

4308
02:04:58,390 --> 02:05:00,400
I do sort of,

4309
02:05:00,760 --> 02:05:02,710
I mean you have to do that eventually.

4310
02:05:03,160 --> 02:05:03,700
Scribner.

4311
02:05:03,700 --> 02:05:04,490
You ever tried that?

4312
02:05:04,490 --> 02:05:04,731
No,

4313
02:05:04,731 --> 02:05:05,511
I don't do that.

4314
02:05:05,511 --> 02:05:06,140
It's kind of stuff.

4315
02:05:06,140 --> 02:05:07,460
You don't do anything on a,

4316
02:05:07,520 --> 02:05:08,353
it's just a,

4317
02:05:08,360 --> 02:05:08,811
it's a,

4318
02:05:08,811 --> 02:05:09,320
um,

4319
02:05:09,320 --> 02:05:10,153
one of those

4320
02:05:10,400 --> 02:05:10,910
programs.

4321
02:05:10,910 --> 02:05:15,300
It shows you a corkboard and it lets
you move index cards around virtual

4322
02:05:15,301 --> 02:05:15,691
corkboard.

4323
02:05:15,691 --> 02:05:16,170
Yeah,

4324
02:05:16,170 --> 02:05:18,630
that's a little too
much mechanical for me.

4325
02:05:19,050 --> 02:05:21,090
But I do try to,

4326
02:05:21,420 --> 02:05:26,420
I mean a lot of times I will start
purely on instinct and just take it from

4327
02:05:27,061 --> 02:05:27,894
there.

4328
02:05:27,930 --> 02:05:30,900
But I think I'm always asking myself,

4329
02:05:31,440 --> 02:05:31,950
what's the,

4330
02:05:31,950 --> 02:05:32,910
what's the finish?

4331
02:05:33,200 --> 02:05:34,770
What is this going to,

4332
02:05:34,830 --> 02:05:35,011
you know,

4333
02:05:35,011 --> 02:05:37,800
I'm always trying to get the final moment,

4334
02:05:37,860 --> 02:05:40,830
the climax and then work
backwards from there.

4335
02:05:41,130 --> 02:05:43,740
Cause within any idea,

4336
02:05:45,930 --> 02:05:46,320
how can I,

4337
02:05:46,320 --> 02:05:46,800
let's see.

4338
02:05:46,800 --> 02:05:47,610
Uh,

4339
02:05:47,610 --> 02:05:49,380
one of the books I wrote was about,

4340
02:05:49,381 --> 02:05:50,214
uh,

4341
02:05:50,280 --> 02:05:54,060
it's called the virtues of war was about
Alexander the Great and the way it kind

4342
02:05:54,061 --> 02:05:58,710
of came to me was the first two sentences
came to me in this first two sentences

4343
02:05:58,711 --> 02:06:01,260
were I have always been a soldier.

4344
02:06:01,470 --> 02:06:03,210
I have known no other life.

4345
02:06:03,750 --> 02:06:04,260
And I,

4346
02:06:04,260 --> 02:06:05,650
when I heard those in my head of style,

4347
02:06:05,660 --> 02:06:06,090
that's,

4348
02:06:06,090 --> 02:06:06,923
that's great.

4349
02:06:07,140 --> 02:06:11,730
But I had no idea who was
saying it or where it went.

4350
02:06:12,240 --> 02:06:12,750
But I,

4351
02:06:12,750 --> 02:06:17,750
so it in a way it's like a finding
that the tip tippy top part of a buried

4352
02:06:20,310 --> 02:06:21,630
asteroid or something.

4353
02:06:22,230 --> 02:06:26,520
So I sort of tried to just partly
foe follow instinct and say,

4354
02:06:26,521 --> 02:06:26,911
well okay,

4355
02:06:26,911 --> 02:06:27,780
what's the next sentence?

4356
02:06:27,781 --> 02:06:28,021
You know,

4357
02:06:28,021 --> 02:06:32,550
what's the next scene but at this then
I'll kind of pull back out of it and say,

4358
02:06:33,180 --> 02:06:35,940
what is his fucking thing about why,

4359
02:06:36,210 --> 02:06:37,440
what is buried,

4360
02:06:37,441 --> 02:06:40,080
what id is buried in those two sentences?

4361
02:06:40,530 --> 02:06:41,363
And then,

4362
02:06:41,430 --> 02:06:42,330
and then I'll try to,

4363
02:06:42,690 --> 02:06:43,810
is this making any sense?

4364
02:06:44,970 --> 02:06:47,400
And then I'll try to push
it forward to the finish.

4365
02:06:47,640 --> 02:06:49,470
What's the climax of this thing?

4366
02:06:49,890 --> 02:06:54,890
And cause otherwise I think maybe Stephen
King is a genius and he can just kind

4367
02:06:54,931 --> 02:06:58,230
of plunge in and just throw shit
against the wall and it'll stick.

4368
02:06:58,710 --> 02:07:00,120
But I think most of us,

4369
02:07:00,180 --> 02:07:00,691
for me,

4370
02:07:00,691 --> 02:07:02,310
I'll get lost if I,

4371
02:07:02,340 --> 02:07:03,060
if I do that,

4372
02:07:03,060 --> 02:07:03,570
you know,

4373
02:07:03,570 --> 02:07:05,040
I'll just write this scene and that scene.

4374
02:07:05,041 --> 02:07:05,730
The other scene and,

4375
02:07:05,730 --> 02:07:06,331
and you know,

4376
02:07:06,331 --> 02:07:07,164
there's no,

4377
02:07:07,440 --> 02:07:07,681
you know,

4378
02:07:07,681 --> 02:07:08,550
I'll get lost in it.

4379
02:07:08,880 --> 02:07:12,600
So I kind of need to know if my
sailboat is hidden for Tahiti.

4380
02:07:13,110 --> 02:07:14,070
That helps me a lot.

4381
02:07:14,071 --> 02:07:16,410
Then I know I got to go
south of Hawaii and you know,

4382
02:07:16,411 --> 02:07:19,560
north of Ltd is so,

4383
02:07:19,710 --> 02:07:20,543
um,

4384
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:21,361
for me,

4385
02:07:21,361 --> 02:07:21,901
in other words,

4386
02:07:21,901 --> 02:07:25,290
it's kind of a combination of
instinct and just winging it,

4387
02:07:25,980 --> 02:07:29,400
but also then pulling back
to the left brain and asking,

4388
02:07:29,670 --> 02:07:30,600
what's this about,

4389
02:07:30,810 --> 02:07:31,830
where's it going?

4390
02:07:32,310 --> 02:07:32,690
And,

4391
02:07:32,690 --> 02:07:34,890
and then structuring it back from,

4392
02:07:35,470 --> 02:07:36,040
I don't know if that

4393
02:07:36,040 --> 02:07:36,873
answers your question.

4394
02:07:37,090 --> 02:07:37,990
I don't know.

4395
02:07:37,991 --> 02:07:38,131
I,

4396
02:07:38,131 --> 02:07:38,370
it's,

4397
02:07:38,370 --> 02:07:41,890
it's interesting cause he didn't go too
far into depth as far as what I've read

4398
02:07:41,891 --> 02:07:42,970
at least that,

4399
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:43,833
um,

4400
02:07:44,040 --> 02:07:44,500
he died,

4401
02:07:44,500 --> 02:07:45,320
I don't know if,

4402
02:07:45,320 --> 02:07:45,560
uh,

4403
02:07:45,560 --> 02:07:49,180
along the way he writes things down
or sets up an ending along the way,

4404
02:07:49,300 --> 02:07:50,133
or he might,

4405
02:07:50,200 --> 02:07:50,830
he's one of those,

4406
02:07:50,830 --> 02:07:52,510
he might fucking write the ending first.

4407
02:07:52,511 --> 02:07:52,961
You know what I mean?

4408
02:07:52,961 --> 02:07:53,650
Who knows?

4409
02:07:53,650 --> 02:07:54,610
I have no idea.

4410
02:07:54,611 --> 02:07:58,240
But his point being is
that when he's writing,

4411
02:07:58,241 --> 02:07:58,960
he's just sort of,

4412
02:07:58,960 --> 02:08:00,100
he's not following,

4413
02:08:00,250 --> 02:08:05,000
like today he's going to write down that
Sally meets Betty and Betty can let on

4414
02:08:05,070 --> 02:08:05,950
fire with her tits.

4415
02:08:06,860 --> 02:08:07,251
You know,

4416
02:08:07,251 --> 02:08:09,260
if you have the idea of Kerry,

4417
02:08:09,680 --> 02:08:09,950
right.

4418
02:08:09,950 --> 02:08:12,530
You know that the climax
is going to be Carrie,

4419
02:08:12,531 --> 02:08:12,951
you know,

4420
02:08:12,951 --> 02:08:14,300
blows everybody away.

4421
02:08:14,301 --> 02:08:14,510
Right.

4422
02:08:14,510 --> 02:08:14,960
Right.

4423
02:08:14,960 --> 02:08:19,850
So you don't have to be to
analytic to figure that out.

4424
02:08:19,880 --> 02:08:21,170
So we kind of knows what's coming.

4425
02:08:21,400 --> 02:08:21,730
Hmm.

4426
02:08:21,730 --> 02:08:22,181
Maybe,

4427
02:08:22,181 --> 02:08:23,860
maybe he might not have
known that that was gonna.

4428
02:08:24,040 --> 02:08:27,340
You know the carry one's
a really interesting one
because he was throwing that

4429
02:08:27,341 --> 02:08:29,230
away and his wife pulled
it out of the trash.

4430
02:08:29,260 --> 02:08:29,471
Yeah.

4431
02:08:29,471 --> 02:08:30,304
That's amazing.

4432
02:08:30,510 --> 02:08:31,110
Yeah,

4433
02:08:31,110 --> 02:08:31,350
that's,

4434
02:08:31,350 --> 02:08:32,740
that was his first big break.

4435
02:08:33,040 --> 02:08:34,450
His wife pulled it out of the trash.

4436
02:08:34,451 --> 02:08:34,901
It was like,

4437
02:08:34,901 --> 02:08:35,231
listen,

4438
02:08:35,231 --> 02:08:35,530
don't,

4439
02:08:35,530 --> 02:08:36,430
don't quit this one.

4440
02:08:36,431 --> 02:08:38,290
But that goes to show you though.

4441
02:08:38,400 --> 02:08:38,740
Oh,

4442
02:08:38,740 --> 02:08:39,580
final power.

4443
02:08:39,620 --> 02:08:43,700
A lot of times we don't even
recognize what great stuff.

4444
02:08:43,900 --> 02:08:44,260
Dot.

4445
02:08:44,260 --> 02:08:44,441
Well,

4446
02:08:44,441 --> 02:08:47,980
it's also probably because he was
drunk and on Coke and his dad as well.

4447
02:08:48,210 --> 02:08:49,043
You can use it.

4448
02:08:49,230 --> 02:08:49,510
I mean,

4449
02:08:49,510 --> 02:08:50,550
he may be the option.

4450
02:08:50,551 --> 02:08:51,460
Maybe he was sober.

4451
02:08:51,760 --> 02:08:53,470
He goes off about his,

4452
02:08:53,471 --> 02:08:53,800
uh,

4453
02:08:53,800 --> 02:08:56,770
his massive amount of drug
use when he was writing books.

4454
02:08:56,920 --> 02:09:01,120
He wrote entire books that
he doesn't remember at all.

4455
02:09:01,270 --> 02:09:03,790
Cujo apparently it
doesn't remember at all.

4456
02:09:04,180 --> 02:09:04,671
Has Your money.

4457
02:09:04,671 --> 02:09:05,900
You can read it for the first time.

4458
02:09:06,720 --> 02:09:07,553
It's awesome.

4459
02:09:07,830 --> 02:09:08,663
This is great.

4460
02:09:09,670 --> 02:09:10,030
Boy.

4461
02:09:10,030 --> 02:09:11,500
Talk about a movie that doesn't hold up.

4462
02:09:11,501 --> 02:09:12,970
I tried to watch Cujo the other day.

4463
02:09:13,870 --> 02:09:14,321
I was like,

4464
02:09:14,321 --> 02:09:16,270
shut this fucking stew that talk stupid.

4465
02:09:16,271 --> 02:09:16,481
Shoot.

4466
02:09:16,481 --> 02:09:18,640
That fucking dumb thing smoothly sucks.

4467
02:09:18,670 --> 02:09:19,960
Like it wasn't scary at all.

4468
02:09:20,380 --> 02:09:20,801
Do you,

4469
02:09:20,801 --> 02:09:21,100
um,

4470
02:09:21,100 --> 02:09:22,630
you've had quite a few of your movies,

4471
02:09:23,110 --> 02:09:24,760
your books rather than it become movies.

4472
02:09:24,940 --> 02:09:26,310
Is that a frustrating per say,

4473
02:09:26,320 --> 02:09:27,140
but,

4474
02:09:27,140 --> 02:09:27,460
well,

4475
02:09:27,460 --> 02:09:31,210
the legend of Bagger Vance was how
many different movies or books have you

4476
02:09:31,240 --> 02:09:31,531
written?

4477
02:09:31,531 --> 02:09:31,640
It,

4478
02:09:31,640 --> 02:09:32,270
it become moving.

4479
02:09:32,270 --> 02:09:33,470
I think that's the only one.

4480
02:09:33,471 --> 02:09:34,130
I mean I've had,

4481
02:09:34,130 --> 02:09:36,350
I've written screenplays
but that became movies.

4482
02:09:36,351 --> 02:09:37,184
But uh,

4483
02:09:37,940 --> 02:09:38,570
uh,

4484
02:09:38,570 --> 02:09:39,291
let me put it this way.

4485
02:09:39,291 --> 02:09:40,790
I've never had a good experience yet.

4486
02:09:41,000 --> 02:09:41,750
Oh Wow.

4487
02:09:41,750 --> 02:09:41,931
You know,

4488
02:09:41,931 --> 02:09:42,900
maybe uh,

4489
02:09:42,940 --> 02:09:44,300
I'm unlucky but I've never had a good,

4490
02:09:44,920 --> 02:09:45,341
I'm sorry.

4491
02:09:45,341 --> 02:09:47,290
I thought you had at
least two that had become,

4492
02:09:47,291 --> 02:09:48,650
maybe it's just forgetting.

4493
02:09:49,330 --> 02:09:50,470
How many screenplays have you,

4494
02:09:50,471 --> 02:09:50,970
uh,

4495
02:09:50,970 --> 02:09:51,260
have,

4496
02:09:51,260 --> 02:09:52,510
have been made from your books?

4497
02:09:52,810 --> 02:09:52,990
Yeah,

4498
02:09:52,990 --> 02:09:53,531
I'm not sure.

4499
02:09:53,531 --> 02:09:54,690
Maybe five or six years.

4500
02:09:54,700 --> 02:09:55,533
That's what I read.

4501
02:09:55,920 --> 02:09:56,380
Um,

4502
02:09:56,380 --> 02:09:58,480
so your all terrible.

4503
02:09:59,560 --> 02:10:01,120
What is it about that?

4504
02:10:01,150 --> 02:10:01,871
Like they can't,

4505
02:10:01,871 --> 02:10:04,570
it's is it because of trying to
condense it to an hour and a half,

4506
02:10:04,571 --> 02:10:05,400
two hours,

4507
02:10:05,400 --> 02:10:07,830
whereas a shitty job from the star,

4508
02:10:07,831 --> 02:10:08,640
you know?

4509
02:10:08,640 --> 02:10:09,191
No.

4510
02:10:09,191 --> 02:10:14,050
Is it the Hollywood machine that that
takes something and can take your ideas,

4511
02:10:14,051 --> 02:10:14,980
which are like,

4512
02:10:14,981 --> 02:10:16,780
as you were talking
about the tides of war,

4513
02:10:16,781 --> 02:10:18,790
there's some ambiguous characters and

4514
02:10:19,020 --> 02:10:19,440
it's a,

4515
02:10:19,440 --> 02:10:19,650
yeah,

4516
02:10:19,650 --> 02:10:20,431
I wish I knew Joe.

4517
02:10:20,431 --> 02:10:20,641
You know,

4518
02:10:20,641 --> 02:10:24,960
I think sometimes writers get
really lucky and you know,

4519
02:10:24,961 --> 02:10:27,030
the godfather comes out fantastic,

4520
02:10:27,031 --> 02:10:27,330
right?

4521
02:10:27,330 --> 02:10:27,571
You know,

4522
02:10:27,571 --> 02:10:28,860
every scene is perfect,

4523
02:10:28,861 --> 02:10:29,610
you know?

4524
02:10:29,610 --> 02:10:30,240
Um,

4525
02:10:30,240 --> 02:10:31,140
and other times,

4526
02:10:32,160 --> 02:10:32,740
you know,

4527
02:10:32,740 --> 02:10:33,380
and then there's,

4528
02:10:33,380 --> 02:10:34,213
there's the,

4529
02:10:34,580 --> 02:10:35,450
the sort of the,

4530
02:10:35,451 --> 02:10:36,284
um,

4531
02:10:36,920 --> 02:10:38,060
the politics of,

4532
02:10:38,360 --> 02:10:40,790
of Hollywood where like if you're casting,

4533
02:10:41,080 --> 02:10:41,913
um,

4534
02:10:42,140 --> 02:10:43,490
the character of Bagger Vance,

4535
02:10:43,491 --> 02:10:44,150
let's say,

4536
02:10:44,150 --> 02:10:47,990
and you want to cast Morgan Freeman who
seems like he would be the perfect guy,

4537
02:10:48,230 --> 02:10:49,790
but they run the numbers and they say,

4538
02:10:49,791 --> 02:10:49,971
well,

4539
02:10:49,971 --> 02:10:52,730
Morgan Freeman is not going
to justify a budget of x,

4540
02:10:52,731 --> 02:10:52,911
Y,

4541
02:10:52,911 --> 02:10:53,630
z.

4542
02:10:53,630 --> 02:10:54,740
So maybe we need to,

4543
02:10:54,980 --> 02:10:56,270
so we can't cast him.

4544
02:10:56,271 --> 02:10:56,900
We have to care.

4545
02:10:56,900 --> 02:10:57,081
You know,

4546
02:10:57,081 --> 02:10:57,914
in other words,

4547
02:10:58,040 --> 02:11:03,040
decisions are driven by factors
other than I would have to,

4548
02:11:03,550 --> 02:11:04,880
other than instinct,

4549
02:11:04,881 --> 02:11:05,714
you know,

4550
02:11:05,830 --> 02:11:07,010
I would have to disagree sir.

4551
02:11:07,011 --> 02:11:08,060
I think some of your movies

4552
02:11:08,240 --> 02:11:08,781
amazing,

4553
02:11:08,781 --> 02:11:12,010
including King Kong lives above the law.

4554
02:11:12,770 --> 02:11:13,430
Well you weren't.

4555
02:11:13,430 --> 02:11:15,140
You made above the Law Free Jack.

4556
02:11:15,200 --> 02:11:16,820
I was one of three good misery people.

4557
02:11:16,821 --> 02:11:18,500
That was the only one
I ever actually liked

4558
02:11:18,910 --> 02:11:19,670
above the law.

4559
02:11:19,670 --> 02:11:20,890
It's Randy Davis,

4560
02:11:20,891 --> 02:11:21,724
the director.

4561
02:11:22,030 --> 02:11:22,331
I mean,

4562
02:11:22,331 --> 02:11:22,601
look,

4563
02:11:22,601 --> 02:11:27,601
I everybody goofs on time gall but above
the law was fucking great at the time.

4564
02:11:29,250 --> 02:11:31,000
Moving is Steven Seagal movie.

4565
02:11:31,090 --> 02:11:34,660
My 14 hours shouldn't because
there's the one that launched him.

4566
02:11:34,690 --> 02:11:38,170
Dow was the one that was the best
above the law was the best one.

4567
02:11:38,171 --> 02:11:39,610
There's a lot of silliness to it.

4568
02:11:39,611 --> 02:11:40,391
Of course there is,

4569
02:11:40,391 --> 02:11:42,040
but it's a God damn cop movie.

4570
02:11:42,220 --> 02:11:45,700
It's about a bad ass guy who's
kicking ass and you know,

4571
02:11:45,730 --> 02:11:46,511
fucking people out.

4572
02:11:46,511 --> 02:11:48,250
There's no way to do that
where it's not silly.

4573
02:11:48,251 --> 02:11:51,910
And Army of one with Dolphin
London can really do that.

4574
02:11:52,230 --> 02:11:52,780
Please.

4575
02:11:52,780 --> 02:11:54,010
Holy Shit Man.

4576
02:11:54,760 --> 02:11:55,990
You guys were going to do this.

4577
02:11:56,240 --> 02:11:56,400
The,

4578
02:11:56,400 --> 02:11:57,233
uh,

4579
02:11:57,640 --> 02:12:00,260
someone told a fib and Brian caught him.

4580
02:12:00,530 --> 02:12:02,860
W why is it about a King Kong?

4581
02:12:02,920 --> 02:12:03,251
I mean,

4582
02:12:03,251 --> 02:12:03,971
what is it about,

4583
02:12:03,971 --> 02:12:04,390
uh,

4584
02:12:04,390 --> 02:12:05,800
the terrible,

4585
02:12:05,801 --> 02:12:06,634
terrible.

4586
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:11,290
That was what that was the movie that
was going on in when you were 40,

4587
02:12:11,320 --> 02:12:14,640
when you were talking about
your life being in a shambles.

4588
02:12:15,670 --> 02:12:16,503
That was that movie.

4589
02:12:16,540 --> 02:12:17,373
Yeah.

4590
02:12:17,950 --> 02:12:20,650
What is it about King Kong that we keep
making that fucking movie over and over

4591
02:12:20,651 --> 02:12:21,484
again?

4592
02:12:21,510 --> 02:12:22,343
Happens.

4593
02:12:22,630 --> 02:12:23,463
Archetype.

4594
02:12:24,100 --> 02:12:25,570
Gorilla thing is a werewolf,

4595
02:12:25,571 --> 02:12:26,080
I suppose.

4596
02:12:26,080 --> 02:12:26,620
Yeah.

4597
02:12:26,620 --> 02:12:26,951
No,

4598
02:12:26,951 --> 02:12:28,550
it's worse because the same goddamn story.

4599
02:12:28,551 --> 02:12:30,100
He always falls off the fucking building.

4600
02:12:30,400 --> 02:12:34,780
An American Werewolf in
London is different than the
man with Benito del Toro.

4601
02:12:34,800 --> 02:12:34,961
Yeah.

4602
02:12:34,961 --> 02:12:38,890
It was a lot more places to go when
they keep redoing that Goddamn King Kong

4603
02:12:38,891 --> 02:12:39,201
movies,

4604
02:12:39,201 --> 02:12:40,720
the same fucking thing happens every time.

4605
02:12:41,260 --> 02:12:45,550
It's like nobody ever figures that they
can make a King Kong movie where he

4606
02:12:45,551 --> 02:12:46,384
doesn't die.

4607
02:12:46,530 --> 02:12:46,810
You know?

4608
02:12:46,810 --> 02:12:50,920
Do you understand that it was a movie
that like somebody made it to begin with

4609
02:12:50,930 --> 02:12:52,210
like a stone tablet.

4610
02:12:52,211 --> 02:12:54,610
You can do a whole
different King Kong story,

4611
02:12:54,640 --> 02:12:55,240
but nope.

4612
02:12:55,240 --> 02:12:55,570
Nope.

4613
02:12:55,570 --> 02:12:56,560
Got a blonde girl,

4614
02:12:56,570 --> 02:12:57,730
get a building climb,

4615
02:12:57,940 --> 02:12:58,721
shoot him down,

4616
02:12:58,721 --> 02:12:59,554
done.

4617
02:12:59,680 --> 02:13:00,071
What is,

4618
02:13:00,071 --> 02:13:02,710
does that frustrate the shit
out of you as a creative guy?

4619
02:13:02,711 --> 02:13:07,360
Like would they want to keep doing the
same goddamn thing over and over again?

4620
02:13:07,990 --> 02:13:08,823
Well,

4621
02:13:08,930 --> 02:13:10,510
I'm not even sure how to answer that too.

4622
02:13:10,520 --> 02:13:11,001
I'll be there.

4623
02:13:11,001 --> 02:13:11,630
There's,

4624
02:13:11,630 --> 02:13:12,021
you know,

4625
02:13:12,021 --> 02:13:13,790
I want to do the same
thing over and over again.

4626
02:13:13,791 --> 02:13:14,421
Sometimes it'd be,

4627
02:13:14,421 --> 02:13:17,840
there are sort of principles of
storytelling that you want to do,

4628
02:13:17,870 --> 02:13:18,650
you know,

4629
02:13:18,650 --> 02:13:19,940
but I mean,

4630
02:13:19,941 --> 02:13:20,661
I know what you mean.

4631
02:13:20,661 --> 02:13:21,231
And it is,

4632
02:13:21,231 --> 02:13:22,310
it is pretty frustrating.

4633
02:13:22,850 --> 02:13:23,683
What do you,

4634
02:13:23,760 --> 02:13:24,021
you know,

4635
02:13:24,021 --> 02:13:26,570
you give a lot of advice
for writing fiction in this,

4636
02:13:26,571 --> 02:13:27,950
especially the authentic swing.

4637
02:13:28,280 --> 02:13:28,880
Um,

4638
02:13:28,880 --> 02:13:30,740
but what about some of
your nonfiction works?

4639
02:13:30,741 --> 02:13:30,930
You know,

4640
02:13:30,930 --> 02:13:32,010
how is that different?

4641
02:13:32,010 --> 02:13:35,520
How is that process different than
crafting a story and characters?

4642
02:13:35,750 --> 02:13:36,080
Um,

4643
02:13:36,080 --> 02:13:37,410
cause you've done amazing job,

4644
02:13:37,660 --> 02:13:37,890
you know,

4645
02:13:37,890 --> 02:13:39,210
writing nonfiction as well.

4646
02:13:39,800 --> 02:13:39,951
Well,

4647
02:13:39,951 --> 02:13:44,360
of course the only nonfiction I've
done is stuff about the writing process

4648
02:13:44,361 --> 02:13:45,770
rather than something like,

4649
02:13:45,771 --> 02:13:46,604
uh,

4650
02:13:46,640 --> 02:13:47,181
you know,

4651
02:13:47,181 --> 02:13:48,014
um,

4652
02:13:48,230 --> 02:13:48,770
uh,

4653
02:13:48,770 --> 02:13:50,230
all the president's men or something.

4654
02:13:50,231 --> 02:13:50,521
Right,

4655
02:13:50,521 --> 02:13:50,741
right,

4656
02:13:50,741 --> 02:13:50,881
right,

4657
02:13:50,881 --> 02:13:51,170
right.

4658
02:13:51,170 --> 02:13:53,090
So that's kind of,

4659
02:13:54,080 --> 02:13:54,261
yeah,

4660
02:13:54,261 --> 02:13:56,000
but that's sort of the specialized genre,

4661
02:13:56,030 --> 02:13:57,380
didactic kind of self help.

4662
02:13:57,590 --> 02:13:59,150
My theory is,

4663
02:13:59,290 --> 02:14:00,040
uh,

4664
02:14:00,040 --> 02:14:03,320
that it has to be a story anyway.

4665
02:14:04,340 --> 02:14:05,090
You know,

4666
02:14:05,090 --> 02:14:05,451
it,

4667
02:14:05,451 --> 02:14:05,750
uh,

4668
02:14:05,750 --> 02:14:09,500
my partner Shawn Coyne is
a big believer in act one,

4669
02:14:09,501 --> 02:14:09,891
act two,

4670
02:14:09,891 --> 02:14:10,430
act three,

4671
02:14:10,430 --> 02:14:11,510
no matter what it is,

4672
02:14:11,870 --> 02:14:13,850
even if it doesn't have any characters,

4673
02:14:14,150 --> 02:14:15,290
it's got to start somewhere,

4674
02:14:15,291 --> 02:14:17,300
have a middle and then have an end.

4675
02:14:17,780 --> 02:14:20,630
So I sort of tried to follow the same,

4676
02:14:21,320 --> 02:14:22,370
the same process,

4677
02:14:22,371 --> 02:14:23,600
make it a story a little bit

4678
02:14:24,110 --> 02:14:25,940
where the reader plays,

4679
02:14:25,941 --> 02:14:26,300
uh,

4680
02:14:26,300 --> 02:14:27,260
plays a role then.

4681
02:14:27,290 --> 02:14:28,820
So the reader is kind of the,

4682
02:14:29,420 --> 02:14:30,420
the protege and you're the

4683
02:14:30,480 --> 02:14:30,850
mentor.

4684
02:14:30,850 --> 02:14:35,130
The reader follows along
rooting for you or you know,

4685
02:14:35,131 --> 02:14:38,850
even if you're on your character is only
salted in there a little bit here and

4686
02:14:38,851 --> 02:14:39,390
there,

4687
02:14:39,390 --> 02:14:39,601
you know,

4688
02:14:39,601 --> 02:14:41,400
going from one fiasco to another,

4689
02:14:41,401 --> 02:14:42,300
to another bed at all,

4690
02:14:42,301 --> 02:14:43,240
sort of if,

4691
02:14:43,400 --> 02:14:43,980
if,

4692
02:14:43,980 --> 02:14:44,910
if you do it right,

4693
02:14:44,911 --> 02:14:47,250
it has a flow to it and
it builds to a climax.

4694
02:14:47,640 --> 02:14:50,550
Like the war of art
starts kind of out with,

4695
02:14:50,551 --> 02:14:51,270
uh,

4696
02:14:51,270 --> 02:14:52,320
it's in three parts.

4697
02:14:52,410 --> 02:14:53,041
My partner,

4698
02:14:53,041 --> 02:14:53,940
Sean figured that out.

4699
02:14:53,941 --> 02:14:54,181
You know,

4700
02:14:54,181 --> 02:14:54,690
it's,

4701
02:14:54,690 --> 02:14:55,523
it's what,

4702
02:14:55,620 --> 02:14:57,390
what is the enemy resistance?

4703
02:14:57,660 --> 02:14:59,120
Second part is what's,

4704
02:14:59,160 --> 02:14:59,670
how do you,

4705
02:14:59,670 --> 02:15:02,280
how do you overcome
that enemy turning pro?

4706
02:15:02,520 --> 02:15:05,100
And the third part is getting
into the metaphysics of it.

4707
02:15:05,130 --> 02:15:06,180
What does it all mean?

4708
02:15:06,750 --> 02:15:08,910
And that's sort of a natural progression,

4709
02:15:08,940 --> 02:15:09,181
you know,

4710
02:15:09,181 --> 02:15:09,930
what's the,

4711
02:15:09,930 --> 02:15:11,700
what's the metaphysical aspect of it?

4712
02:15:12,120 --> 02:15:13,080
And at the end,

4713
02:15:13,200 --> 02:15:14,033
what's the,

4714
02:15:14,220 --> 02:15:15,570
what's the spiritual side of it?

4715
02:15:15,571 --> 02:15:15,880
Right?

4716
02:15:15,880 --> 02:15:16,440
That's this,

4717
02:15:16,440 --> 02:15:21,440
that's the aspect of what you've written
in your book that makes it not really a

4718
02:15:21,751 --> 02:15:22,800
book about writing.

4719
02:15:23,190 --> 02:15:25,200
It's not really a book
about the creative process.

4720
02:15:25,201 --> 02:15:27,090
It's a book about achieving a mindset.

4721
02:15:27,150 --> 02:15:27,521
It's a book,

4722
02:15:27,521 --> 02:15:32,521
a book about achieving a victory
over this resistance thing.

4723
02:15:32,880 --> 02:15:33,631
And uh,

4724
02:15:33,631 --> 02:15:33,961
the,

4725
02:15:33,961 --> 02:15:34,141
the,

4726
02:15:34,141 --> 02:15:36,420
the achieving this
state of mind that just,

4727
02:15:36,421 --> 02:15:36,690
no,

4728
02:15:36,690 --> 02:15:37,980
there's no nonsense.

4729
02:15:38,010 --> 02:15:41,220
Cut Out all the nonsense
and get to it state of mind.

4730
02:15:41,730 --> 02:15:42,031
You know,

4731
02:15:42,031 --> 02:15:42,421
it's like a,

4732
02:15:42,421 --> 02:15:43,680
it's a psychological handbook.

4733
02:15:43,740 --> 02:15:44,020
Yeah.

4734
02:15:44,020 --> 02:15:45,290
It's the writing as,

4735
02:15:45,291 --> 02:15:45,841
as you know,

4736
02:15:45,841 --> 02:15:46,890
I think you even point this out.

4737
02:15:46,891 --> 02:15:49,040
It's just a metaphor for the process.

4738
02:15:49,080 --> 02:15:49,501
Same what?

4739
02:15:49,501 --> 02:15:50,334
Same with golf,

4740
02:15:50,430 --> 02:15:53,760
which I didn't even realize when I was
doing it kind of became clear afterwards.

4741
02:15:53,970 --> 02:15:55,050
Are you a big golf man?

4742
02:15:55,051 --> 02:15:56,190
Is that why you keep writing?

4743
02:15:56,191 --> 02:15:57,090
And I was stuck off

4744
02:15:57,190 --> 02:15:57,941
when I was a kid.

4745
02:15:57,941 --> 02:15:58,420
I was,

4746
02:15:58,420 --> 02:15:59,680
I grew up as a caddy,

4747
02:16:00,310 --> 02:16:00,641
you know,

4748
02:16:00,641 --> 02:16:03,760
so from the time I was like 11
till all the way through college,

4749
02:16:03,761 --> 02:16:03,941
you know,

4750
02:16:03,941 --> 02:16:06,010
back in the days where the
worst such things just caddies.

4751
02:16:06,340 --> 02:16:07,990
So I kinda grew up in the caddy shack,

4752
02:16:07,991 --> 02:16:08,890
just like a,

4753
02:16:08,891 --> 02:16:09,221
you know,

4754
02:16:09,221 --> 02:16:10,270
Rodney Dangerfield.

4755
02:16:10,720 --> 02:16:11,553
And uh,

4756
02:16:12,040 --> 02:16:15,310
but since then I haven't
really been able to play.

4757
02:16:15,340 --> 02:16:16,750
So really why is that?

4758
02:16:17,020 --> 02:16:18,010
I'm working for a living.

4759
02:16:18,060 --> 02:16:18,171
Yeah.

4760
02:16:18,171 --> 02:16:18,871
That's hilarious.

4761
02:16:18,871 --> 02:16:21,870
So you don't give yourself a chance to
like take a little day off and go play

4762
02:16:21,871 --> 02:16:22,250
golf.

4763
02:16:22,250 --> 02:16:22,521
I mean,

4764
02:16:22,521 --> 02:16:23,600
I do that every once in a while,

4765
02:16:23,601 --> 02:16:24,440
but I'm so lousy.

4766
02:16:24,441 --> 02:16:25,340
It's pretty depressing.

4767
02:16:25,370 --> 02:16:25,551
You know?

4768
02:16:25,551 --> 02:16:25,881
It's like,

4769
02:16:25,881 --> 02:16:29,670
I remember when I graduated
from college to New York,

4770
02:16:29,671 --> 02:16:30,280
got married

4771
02:16:30,280 --> 02:16:32,200
first day we moved into the city,

4772
02:16:32,800 --> 02:16:33,250
the car,

4773
02:16:33,250 --> 02:16:35,710
my car was vandalized and
they stole my golf clubs.

4774
02:16:35,711 --> 02:16:37,420
I didn't play for another 20 years,

4775
02:16:37,421 --> 02:16:38,050
you know?

4776
02:16:38,050 --> 02:16:39,610
And then by the time I did then,

4777
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:40,833
you know,

4778
02:16:41,520 --> 02:16:42,910
it's interesting was all in my memory,

4779
02:16:42,930 --> 02:16:43,880
the love for the sport,

4780
02:16:43,881 --> 02:16:45,360
it seems to bleed out in this and the,

4781
02:16:45,430 --> 02:16:45,971
I love this.

4782
02:16:45,971 --> 02:16:46,751
I love the game.

4783
02:16:46,751 --> 02:16:48,280
It's a game.

4784
02:16:49,160 --> 02:16:50,080
Weird people

4785
02:16:50,620 --> 02:16:52,540
watching golf more than you like,

4786
02:16:53,130 --> 02:16:53,371
well,

4787
02:16:53,371 --> 02:16:56,310
I would love playing golf more if
I played below better than I play.

4788
02:16:57,090 --> 02:16:59,790
So do you get very self critical
on yourself when you play golf?

4789
02:16:59,791 --> 02:17:00,350
Is that,

4790
02:17:00,350 --> 02:17:00,750
uh,

4791
02:17:00,750 --> 02:17:02,060
bring up a love that I,

4792
02:17:02,510 --> 02:17:06,330
I mean I've been so bad for so long
that I kind of forgive myself now.

4793
02:17:06,331 --> 02:17:06,601
You know,

4794
02:17:06,601 --> 02:17:07,200
it's like,

4795
02:17:07,200 --> 02:17:08,300
isn't that part of now my,

4796
02:17:08,590 --> 02:17:11,070
my main goal is just not to hurt myself,

4797
02:17:11,071 --> 02:17:11,904
you know,

4798
02:17:13,590 --> 02:17:14,121
get through it.

4799
02:17:14,121 --> 02:17:14,701
Try to enjoy,

4800
02:17:14,701 --> 02:17:15,550
not kidding either.

4801
02:17:15,880 --> 02:17:17,670
Do you walk in or do you take the cart?

4802
02:17:17,760 --> 02:17:18,570
Uh,

4803
02:17:18,570 --> 02:17:19,131
well I,

4804
02:17:19,131 --> 02:17:20,640
I tried to walk when I can,

4805
02:17:20,641 --> 02:17:21,120
you know,

4806
02:17:21,120 --> 02:17:24,780
but I'm pretty much Karcher
the way it is these days.

4807
02:17:24,781 --> 02:17:25,490
You know,

4808
02:17:25,490 --> 02:17:26,870
I think people are being pussies.

4809
02:17:26,900 --> 02:17:27,621
I think if you,

4810
02:17:27,621 --> 02:17:29,480
if you're gonna knock
that ball that far away,

4811
02:17:29,510 --> 02:17:30,740
you should go walk off.

4812
02:17:30,830 --> 02:17:31,180
Nice.

4813
02:17:31,180 --> 02:17:31,891
I agree with it.

4814
02:17:31,891 --> 02:17:32,441
It's too bad.

4815
02:17:32,441 --> 02:17:35,380
Then you should carry your own
fucking clubs evolve to that point.

4816
02:17:35,700 --> 02:17:36,600
It's we're cowards,

4817
02:17:36,810 --> 02:17:38,020
we're were cowards and pussies.

4818
02:17:38,021 --> 02:17:40,260
So we will have other people carry
our clubs and getting the thing.

4819
02:17:41,050 --> 02:17:42,130
It's fun to drive those when you're,

4820
02:17:42,240 --> 02:17:43,800
it is fun to drive those,

4821
02:17:44,040 --> 02:17:46,170
but the problem is play some serious golf.

4822
02:17:46,171 --> 02:17:48,290
You need to whack that fucker
and then walk after it.

4823
02:17:48,300 --> 02:17:50,550
Problem when you really
suck though is if you walk,

4824
02:17:50,880 --> 02:17:54,660
there will be people just so mad at
just right behind you cause it's taken

4825
02:17:54,661 --> 02:17:55,141
forever.

4826
02:17:55,141 --> 02:17:58,740
You got to go walk to the left and you
got to walk to the right and then you got

4827
02:17:58,741 --> 02:17:58,801
it.

4828
02:17:58,801 --> 02:17:59,634
It looks as if it's me.

4829
02:17:59,760 --> 02:18:00,660
Then you walk to the left,

4830
02:18:00,661 --> 02:18:00,811
you know,

4831
02:18:00,811 --> 02:18:01,470
I'm all over there.

4832
02:18:01,470 --> 02:18:02,220
It's so cool.

4833
02:18:02,220 --> 02:18:02,761
I was in,

4834
02:18:02,761 --> 02:18:03,594
um,

4835
02:18:03,620 --> 02:18:06,690
I guess it's like Beverly Hills the
other day at a meeting and I'm uh,

4836
02:18:06,750 --> 02:18:07,291
at this,

4837
02:18:07,291 --> 02:18:07,650
uh,

4838
02:18:07,650 --> 02:18:12,510
network and I'm looking out the window
and they have this giant view of this

4839
02:18:12,511 --> 02:18:16,170
golf course and just the
mass of the golf course.

4840
02:18:16,171 --> 02:18:17,610
I had to take it into my head.

4841
02:18:17,611 --> 02:18:18,150
I'm like,

4842
02:18:18,150 --> 02:18:19,860
how much is that worth?

4843
02:18:19,990 --> 02:18:20,370
Like,

4844
02:18:20,370 --> 02:18:23,310
I guess it was Beverly Hills Country Club
or one of those big country clubs down

4845
02:18:23,311 --> 02:18:23,730
there.

4846
02:18:23,730 --> 02:18:24,151
And I'm like,

4847
02:18:24,151 --> 02:18:29,151
this is a giant piece of land in the
middle of like the most expensive real

4848
02:18:29,521 --> 02:18:30,480
estate in the country.

4849
02:18:30,481 --> 02:18:31,890
Like this is crazy.

4850
02:18:32,040 --> 02:18:34,050
That's a $300 million plot of land.

4851
02:18:34,110 --> 02:18:34,831
It is amazing.

4852
02:18:34,831 --> 02:18:35,910
That's La Country Club.

4853
02:18:35,911 --> 02:18:37,020
It's two courses there.

4854
02:18:37,530 --> 02:18:39,090
So that's a lot of lamp.

4855
02:18:39,091 --> 02:18:40,170
I imagine what that's worth.

4856
02:18:40,300 --> 02:18:41,133
It's nuts,

4857
02:18:41,350 --> 02:18:41,891
but it's what a,

4858
02:18:41,891 --> 02:18:43,060
what a wacky sport.

4859
02:18:43,480 --> 02:18:45,170
You're going to walk around the land,

4860
02:18:45,200 --> 02:18:45,580
you know,

4861
02:18:45,580 --> 02:18:46,361
and it rains,

4862
02:18:46,361 --> 02:18:47,020
you're fucked.

4863
02:18:47,020 --> 02:18:47,853
You know,

4864
02:18:48,570 --> 02:18:53,570
it's a crazy sport where you need a giant
piece of land and so like influential

4865
02:18:54,101 --> 02:18:56,530
as far as like business
meetings and you know,

4866
02:18:56,560 --> 02:19:00,220
people that love to like get
together and play golf together.

4867
02:19:00,370 --> 02:19:00,611
It's like,

4868
02:19:00,611 --> 02:19:02,260
it's a big part of the comradery

4869
02:19:03,470 --> 02:19:04,560
I think for business.

4870
02:19:04,561 --> 02:19:06,840
It reveals something about the
person you're playing with.

4871
02:19:06,960 --> 02:19:09,690
That's pretty unique because
it will bring to the surface.

4872
02:19:09,900 --> 02:19:14,600
Those parts of themselves
that are a little ugly are
a little weird or noble and

4873
02:19:14,770 --> 02:19:15,450
and good.

4874
02:19:15,450 --> 02:19:15,661
You know,

4875
02:19:15,661 --> 02:19:16,800
when you play with somebody,

4876
02:19:16,950 --> 02:19:18,930
you get to know more than
just your conversation,

4877
02:19:19,440 --> 02:19:19,711
you know,

4878
02:19:19,711 --> 02:19:22,350
because you see if they're going to fudge
it and they're going to cheat a little

4879
02:19:22,351 --> 02:19:25,110
bit if they're going to
get really self critical.

4880
02:19:25,111 --> 02:19:28,870
And I get all mad at Ryan Callahan

4881
02:19:29,060 --> 02:19:29,691
had a,

4882
02:19:29,691 --> 02:19:34,691
an instance when his father was playing
golf with this man and his mother was

4883
02:19:34,941 --> 02:19:39,941
there and his mother watched the Guy
Playing Golf with his dad cheat and then

4884
02:19:40,011 --> 02:19:40,670
told them,

4885
02:19:40,670 --> 02:19:43,310
do not go into business with this guy.

4886
02:19:43,700 --> 02:19:44,840
And she told him why.

4887
02:19:45,200 --> 02:19:45,801
And he was like,

4888
02:19:45,801 --> 02:19:46,370
Whoa,

4889
02:19:46,370 --> 02:19:48,890
like in Brian as a young
man remembers that.

4890
02:19:48,891 --> 02:19:49,750
Like that's just,

4891
02:19:49,870 --> 02:19:50,810
it's just a game.

4892
02:19:50,990 --> 02:19:51,681
And she was like,

4893
02:19:51,681 --> 02:19:51,891
no,

4894
02:19:51,891 --> 02:19:52,580
it's not.

4895
02:19:52,580 --> 02:19:52,761
No,

4896
02:19:52,761 --> 02:19:53,180
it's not.

4897
02:19:53,180 --> 02:19:54,013
It just a game.

4898
02:19:54,110 --> 02:19:55,220
It is just a game of,

4899
02:19:55,221 --> 02:19:56,330
so why did he cheat it?

4900
02:19:56,331 --> 02:19:57,164
Just a game?

4901
02:19:57,920 --> 02:19:59,210
Because that's what he does.

4902
02:19:59,580 --> 02:20:00,530
That's who he is.

4903
02:20:00,830 --> 02:20:02,480
That sleazy motherfucker.

4904
02:20:03,560 --> 02:20:03,741
Yeah.

4905
02:20:03,741 --> 02:20:04,491
So in that,

4906
02:20:04,491 --> 02:20:04,881
yeah,

4907
02:20:04,881 --> 02:20:05,714
you can learn,

4908
02:20:05,780 --> 02:20:07,400
but I've heard women complain.

4909
02:20:07,520 --> 02:20:07,851
Um,

4910
02:20:07,851 --> 02:20:11,860
it's an interesting argument that there's
like a patriarchy thing about these a

4911
02:20:11,900 --> 02:20:16,370
men's club meetings on golf courses
that they could never get in on this and

4912
02:20:16,371 --> 02:20:16,640
that,

4913
02:20:16,640 --> 02:20:17,031
you know,

4914
02:20:17,031 --> 02:20:17,310
the,

4915
02:20:17,310 --> 02:20:18,830
they would never be in,

4916
02:20:18,831 --> 02:20:19,880
even if they were in that circle,

4917
02:20:19,881 --> 02:20:21,200
they would almost like be,

4918
02:20:21,230 --> 02:20:22,910
it would be the white
elephant in the room,

4919
02:20:23,360 --> 02:20:23,691
you know,

4920
02:20:23,691 --> 02:20:27,410
and that they would have to learn how
to play golf and go in order to have a,

4921
02:20:27,620 --> 02:20:31,820
like an equal stake in the companies
and an equal stake in the future.

4922
02:20:32,090 --> 02:20:35,270
You have to kind of be a part of this
little goofy club of these fuckers chasing

4923
02:20:35,271 --> 02:20:36,104
after a ball.

4924
02:20:36,350 --> 02:20:37,820
It's very weird.

4925
02:20:37,850 --> 02:20:38,570
They can learn.

4926
02:20:38,570 --> 02:20:39,440
It's not MMA.

4927
02:20:39,590 --> 02:20:39,741
Yeah,

4928
02:20:39,741 --> 02:20:40,850
but why should they have to,

4929
02:20:40,880 --> 02:20:41,320
I mean,

4930
02:20:41,320 --> 02:20:43,020
shouldn't it be the men ideally.

4931
02:20:43,630 --> 02:20:43,910
Right.

4932
02:20:43,910 --> 02:20:44,480
But I do,

4933
02:20:44,480 --> 02:20:44,631
well,

4934
02:20:44,631 --> 02:20:45,470
some of them do though.

4935
02:20:45,471 --> 02:20:46,304
That's the thing,

4936
02:20:46,370 --> 02:20:48,590
in order to be like in that sort of,

4937
02:20:48,740 --> 02:20:52,010
they are people that in order
to be in the group with them,

4938
02:20:52,011 --> 02:20:53,270
you have to do the things they do.

4939
02:20:53,390 --> 02:20:53,991
They have to,

4940
02:20:53,991 --> 02:20:57,380
you have to like the kind of music they
like and it's a part of the tribe thing.

4941
02:20:57,500 --> 02:20:59,420
It's a part of our tribal instincts.

4942
02:20:59,510 --> 02:21:00,320
You have to be,

4943
02:21:00,320 --> 02:21:02,930
you have to have like two people
don't like working together.

4944
02:21:02,931 --> 02:21:04,490
If one's a Republican and one's Democrat,

4945
02:21:04,491 --> 02:21:06,410
they fucking hate each other.

4946
02:21:06,650 --> 02:21:07,011
You know?

4947
02:21:07,011 --> 02:21:07,231
And,

4948
02:21:07,231 --> 02:21:11,120
and I've seen it in offices like this
fucking liberal breeding hard over here

4949
02:21:11,330 --> 02:21:11,910
and it was guy.

4950
02:21:11,910 --> 02:21:13,460
Everything will go bama over.

4951
02:21:13,790 --> 02:21:16,520
And then there's another one that's
fucking redneck asshole over here.

4952
02:21:16,521 --> 02:21:16,701
You know,

4953
02:21:16,701 --> 02:21:17,690
if he could have his way,

4954
02:21:17,691 --> 02:21:17,841
we,

4955
02:21:17,841 --> 02:21:18,021
you know,

4956
02:21:18,021 --> 02:21:20,250
we don't have slavery again and there's,

4957
02:21:20,270 --> 02:21:21,990
that kind of shit is just,

4958
02:21:21,991 --> 02:21:22,970
it's so prevalent.

4959
02:21:23,930 --> 02:21:24,950
It's interesting that the,

4960
02:21:24,951 --> 02:21:25,161
the,

4961
02:21:25,161 --> 02:21:27,020
the game of golf sort of like,

4962
02:21:27,210 --> 02:21:28,490
it encompasses a,

4963
02:21:28,491 --> 02:21:30,320
an aspect of that tribal behavior.

4964
02:21:30,680 --> 02:21:30,951
You know?

4965
02:21:30,951 --> 02:21:33,150
I think you can probably do
that with most sports too.

4966
02:21:33,210 --> 02:21:33,411
I mean,

4967
02:21:33,411 --> 02:21:35,480
how much do you learn about
somebody when you roll with them,

4968
02:21:35,481 --> 02:21:35,900
Joe?

4969
02:21:35,900 --> 02:21:36,111
Oh,

4970
02:21:36,111 --> 02:21:37,130
you'll learn every,

4971
02:21:37,131 --> 02:21:37,970
learn everything,

4972
02:21:37,971 --> 02:21:38,180
right?

4973
02:21:38,180 --> 02:21:40,040
You learn everything
and learn who they are,

4974
02:21:40,400 --> 02:21:41,330
especially when they're tired.

4975
02:21:41,510 --> 02:21:41,950
Yeah.

4976
02:21:41,950 --> 02:21:43,460
We learned a lot of that
person when they're tired.

4977
02:21:43,490 --> 02:21:44,750
Some dude's can keep going,

4978
02:21:44,780 --> 02:21:45,230
so I'm good.

4979
02:21:45,230 --> 02:21:46,550
Just fucking fall down.

4980
02:21:46,551 --> 02:21:47,570
They just flatten out.

4981
02:21:48,260 --> 02:21:48,590
Yeah,

4982
02:21:48,590 --> 02:21:49,423
it's interesting.

4983
02:21:49,670 --> 02:21:50,503
It's um,

4984
02:21:51,050 --> 02:21:51,500
it's,

4985
02:21:51,500 --> 02:21:52,640
you learned about pool too.

4986
02:21:52,641 --> 02:21:53,450
Same thing,

4987
02:21:53,450 --> 02:21:54,283
same thing.

4988
02:21:54,420 --> 02:21:55,400
Pursued any,

4989
02:21:55,401 --> 02:21:56,480
any sort of a pursuit.

4990
02:21:57,070 --> 02:21:57,290
It's,

4991
02:21:57,290 --> 02:21:58,310
if it becomes hard,

4992
02:21:58,460 --> 02:21:58,850
you know,

4993
02:21:58,850 --> 02:22:00,260
you learn who can keep it together,

4994
02:22:00,600 --> 02:22:01,520
who's going to fall apart.

4995
02:22:01,820 --> 02:22:02,190
Just,

4996
02:22:02,190 --> 02:22:02,660
you know,

4997
02:22:02,660 --> 02:22:02,890
and,

4998
02:22:02,890 --> 02:22:03,770
and doing this,

4999
02:22:03,830 --> 02:22:04,900
it's the practice for,

5000
02:22:04,901 --> 02:22:05,734
for the life,

5001
02:22:05,780 --> 02:22:06,051
you know?

5002
02:22:06,051 --> 02:22:09,620
And I think that's why I always innately
people who've been in athletics,

5003
02:22:09,621 --> 02:22:10,520
male or female,

5004
02:22:10,521 --> 02:22:13,490
I have such a much greater
affinity towards and trust,

5005
02:22:13,790 --> 02:22:14,001
you know,

5006
02:22:14,001 --> 02:22:17,750
when they've been to a high level and
they felt that pressure of fans and

5007
02:22:17,751 --> 02:22:20,570
obligations and expectation
and pushed through,

5008
02:22:20,720 --> 02:22:21,050
you know,

5009
02:22:21,050 --> 02:22:22,400
I know the feeling when you know,

5010
02:22:22,401 --> 02:22:24,350
some days and these biggest
games in high school,

5011
02:22:24,351 --> 02:22:26,010
we'd get a couple thousand people's Texas

5012
02:22:26,010 --> 02:22:28,770
sports and it would be so intense.

5013
02:22:28,771 --> 02:22:30,930
I would just want to go
to sleep before the game.

5014
02:22:31,170 --> 02:22:31,981
I just want to curl.

5015
02:22:31,981 --> 02:22:34,740
It has just really tired right now.

5016
02:22:34,920 --> 02:22:37,440
But then you get out there and you
feel the rush and you put your,

5017
02:22:37,441 --> 02:22:37,680
you know,

5018
02:22:37,680 --> 02:22:42,000
put your forearm into somebody on that
first play and get your first hard drive

5019
02:22:42,001 --> 02:22:45,210
to the basket and then this feeling
just kind of explodes and you,

5020
02:22:45,211 --> 02:22:45,960
and you're in it,

5021
02:22:45,960 --> 02:22:46,201
you know?

5022
02:22:46,201 --> 02:22:48,510
But making it through that
process without folding.

5023
02:22:48,660 --> 02:22:52,830
There was also other games where I never
got that kind of restrictive energy out

5024
02:22:52,831 --> 02:22:54,060
and I played like shit,

5025
02:22:54,300 --> 02:22:54,481
you know,

5026
02:22:54,481 --> 02:22:55,440
just terrible.

5027
02:22:55,590 --> 02:22:56,640
And you learn about that.

5028
02:22:56,641 --> 02:22:58,200
You learn how to deal with the pressure,

5029
02:22:58,201 --> 02:22:59,250
not internalize it,

5030
02:22:59,460 --> 02:23:00,510
push through and,

5031
02:23:00,810 --> 02:23:01,643
and men,

5032
02:23:01,650 --> 02:23:04,080
so many times in business
and these challenges,

5033
02:23:04,110 --> 02:23:04,381
you know,

5034
02:23:04,381 --> 02:23:05,100
it applies,

5035
02:23:05,100 --> 02:23:05,933
it applies.

5036
02:23:06,420 --> 02:23:08,190
Pressure is to deal with pressure.

5037
02:23:08,190 --> 02:23:09,000
Exactly.

5038
02:23:09,000 --> 02:23:10,320
You got to get used to that bitch.

5039
02:23:10,950 --> 02:23:12,810
Gotta feel her and what she does,

5040
02:23:13,260 --> 02:23:14,093
how she tricks you,

5041
02:23:15,030 --> 02:23:15,930
messes with your head.

5042
02:23:15,960 --> 02:23:17,520
That's it messes with your head.

5043
02:23:17,521 --> 02:23:18,630
You've got to learn that too.

5044
02:23:18,690 --> 02:23:19,090
That's a,

5045
02:23:19,090 --> 02:23:19,801
that's the big one.

5046
02:23:19,801 --> 02:23:20,310
Just like,

5047
02:23:20,310 --> 02:23:20,700
you know,

5048
02:23:20,700 --> 02:23:21,870
essentially it's resistance.

5049
02:23:21,871 --> 02:23:22,704
It's the same thing.

5050
02:23:22,920 --> 02:23:23,790
That doubt,

5051
02:23:23,850 --> 02:23:26,760
that creeping doubt makes its way.

5052
02:23:26,850 --> 02:23:27,683
You got to figure out a way.

5053
02:23:28,560 --> 02:23:28,861
Yeah.

5054
02:23:28,861 --> 02:23:29,694
Boy,

5055
02:23:29,700 --> 02:23:31,770
and we are all luck contributing to this.

5056
02:23:31,771 --> 02:23:35,400
A collective guidebook
of how to be a human.

5057
02:23:35,850 --> 02:23:36,600
You know,

5058
02:23:36,600 --> 02:23:36,871
you know,

5059
02:23:36,871 --> 02:23:39,870
one thing I've just recently started
playing with that it occurred to me that

5060
02:23:39,871 --> 02:23:44,280
there's little fears that we think
of as trivial and a trivial fear,

5061
02:23:44,281 --> 02:23:45,960
like a fear of spiders or,

5062
02:23:46,200 --> 02:23:47,790
and there's also things like,

5063
02:23:48,150 --> 02:23:48,721
for example,

5064
02:23:48,721 --> 02:23:49,111
for me,

5065
02:23:49,111 --> 02:23:52,530
I have this block about doing
a backflip on a trampoline,

5066
02:23:52,531 --> 02:23:53,790
even like a super safe,

5067
02:23:53,791 --> 02:23:54,624
super big one.

5068
02:23:54,720 --> 02:23:56,220
And I can back flip into pools.

5069
02:23:56,221 --> 02:23:57,030
I can do,

5070
02:23:57,030 --> 02:23:57,180
yeah,

5071
02:23:57,180 --> 02:23:58,890
I'm a fairly athletic guy,

5072
02:23:59,190 --> 02:24:01,410
but as soon as I go to
do it on a trampoline,

5073
02:24:01,411 --> 02:24:02,400
which is fairly soft,

5074
02:24:02,580 --> 02:24:07,080
my body just freezes up and I lock and
I was talking to my friend about it.

5075
02:24:07,500 --> 02:24:08,970
And for me,

5076
02:24:08,971 --> 02:24:09,181
you know,

5077
02:24:09,181 --> 02:24:13,230
when you allow these fears
that are disproportionate
away from the actual danger

5078
02:24:13,590 --> 02:24:14,460
to take hold,

5079
02:24:14,640 --> 02:24:16,290
it's almost giving credence,

5080
02:24:16,310 --> 02:24:16,531
you know,

5081
02:24:16,531 --> 02:24:17,460
giving resistance,

5082
02:24:17,461 --> 02:24:20,160
like this little bit of victory
that can apply to other things.

5083
02:24:20,310 --> 02:24:22,500
Or if you're so afraid of spiders,

5084
02:24:22,501 --> 02:24:23,580
you can't even look at it.

5085
02:24:23,880 --> 02:24:24,450
You know?

5086
02:24:24,450 --> 02:24:25,560
Just by doing that,

5087
02:24:25,561 --> 02:24:28,380
it's acknowledging that you
have some certain limitations,

5088
02:24:28,650 --> 02:24:28,891
you know,

5089
02:24:28,891 --> 02:24:33,030
and it's giving that other force that's
going to limit you in life and deny you

5090
02:24:33,031 --> 02:24:34,380
from achieving your goal.

5091
02:24:34,470 --> 02:24:35,910
Just a little bit more power.

5092
02:24:36,180 --> 02:24:37,230
So even for me,

5093
02:24:37,231 --> 02:24:41,130
and this is something I'm just recently
playing with these little trivial fears

5094
02:24:41,131 --> 02:24:42,270
that we just kind of avoid like,

5095
02:24:42,300 --> 02:24:42,421
ah,

5096
02:24:42,421 --> 02:24:43,320
this doesn't matter.

5097
02:24:43,410 --> 02:24:43,621
You know,

5098
02:24:43,621 --> 02:24:44,041
who cares?

5099
02:24:44,041 --> 02:24:45,090
What am I going to see a spider?

5100
02:24:45,091 --> 02:24:45,510
I don't know.

5101
02:24:45,510 --> 02:24:48,750
I'll fucking deal with it when it
comes or cares if I do a backflip on a

5102
02:24:48,751 --> 02:24:49,261
trampoline,

5103
02:24:49,261 --> 02:24:50,094
you know,

5104
02:24:50,100 --> 02:24:52,080
in effect that practically
it doesn't matter.

5105
02:24:52,081 --> 02:24:56,310
But as far as doing the little things
to battle against these forces that are

5106
02:24:56,311 --> 02:24:57,900
constantly looking to confine us,

5107
02:24:58,380 --> 02:24:59,790
I think maybe it matters.

5108
02:25:00,150 --> 02:25:00,391
You know,

5109
02:25:00,391 --> 02:25:03,480
like maybe pushing through
these seemingly trivial things.

5110
02:25:03,630 --> 02:25:04,463
It counts.

5111
02:25:04,920 --> 02:25:05,360
You know,

5112
02:25:05,360 --> 02:25:06,193
it's an exercise.

5113
02:25:06,750 --> 02:25:08,610
Set yourself the task Aubrey,

5114
02:25:08,611 --> 02:25:09,444
to do that.

5115
02:25:09,450 --> 02:25:09,931
Oh yeah,

5116
02:25:09,931 --> 02:25:10,381
for sure.

5117
02:25:10,381 --> 02:25:11,940
I decided that like last,

5118
02:25:11,970 --> 02:25:12,810
like a few days ago,

5119
02:25:12,811 --> 02:25:13,644
I haven't been home yet.

5120
02:25:13,680 --> 02:25:17,160
I'm walking out to the trampoline and
I'm pushing through that moment where my

5121
02:25:17,161 --> 02:25:17,910
legs just say,

5122
02:25:17,910 --> 02:25:18,420
Eh,

5123
02:25:18,420 --> 02:25:19,110
nobody,

5124
02:25:19,110 --> 02:25:20,820
you're not doing this
and I'm going to do it.

5125
02:25:20,821 --> 02:25:21,540
I hope.

5126
02:25:21,540 --> 02:25:22,373
I hope I can.

5127
02:25:22,830 --> 02:25:23,291
I don't know,

5128
02:25:23,291 --> 02:25:24,220
but I'll see y'all video.

5129
02:25:25,160 --> 02:25:25,993
Figure it out.

5130
02:25:26,060 --> 02:25:29,900
I would guess that the backflip
is a metaphor for something else,

5131
02:25:29,901 --> 02:25:30,171
for you.

5132
02:25:30,171 --> 02:25:31,070
Stands for something.

5133
02:25:31,280 --> 02:25:32,113
Right.

5134
02:25:32,190 --> 02:25:33,080
And I mean,

5135
02:25:33,081 --> 02:25:33,950
we all have that stuff.

5136
02:25:33,951 --> 02:25:35,600
For me it's like claustrophobia.

5137
02:25:35,820 --> 02:25:36,140
Yeah.

5138
02:25:36,140 --> 02:25:36,850
You know,

5139
02:25:36,850 --> 02:25:37,311
elevator,

5140
02:25:37,311 --> 02:25:38,270
certain elevators.

5141
02:25:38,271 --> 02:25:40,190
I can't get on airplanes,

5142
02:25:40,191 --> 02:25:40,850
you know?

5143
02:25:40,850 --> 02:25:43,280
And I know that it's,

5144
02:25:43,580 --> 02:25:45,560
it relates to other stuff,

5145
02:25:45,561 --> 02:25:45,801
you know,

5146
02:25:45,801 --> 02:25:46,634
it's not,

5147
02:25:47,060 --> 02:25:48,290
it's not isolated.

5148
02:25:48,790 --> 02:25:49,230
Yeah.

5149
02:25:49,230 --> 02:25:51,690
Have you ever done a sensory
deprivation tank experience?

5150
02:25:51,720 --> 02:25:51,991
No.

5151
02:25:51,991 --> 02:25:52,650
Never have.

5152
02:25:52,650 --> 02:25:53,130
Oh,

5153
02:25:53,130 --> 02:25:53,641
you need to get,

5154
02:25:53,641 --> 02:25:53,731
well,

5155
02:25:53,731 --> 02:25:54,180
you do it.

5156
02:25:54,180 --> 02:25:55,080
If I hook it up for you,

5157
02:25:55,190 --> 02:25:56,023
I don't know.

5158
02:25:56,080 --> 02:25:58,100
I don't look like a
claustrophobic in there.

5159
02:25:58,160 --> 02:25:58,993
That's what I'm saying.

5160
02:25:59,230 --> 02:26:00,170
You got we through that.

5161
02:26:00,171 --> 02:26:00,441
Come on,

5162
02:26:00,441 --> 02:26:00,750
man.

5163
02:26:00,750 --> 02:26:02,570
Will tell me what is the walk?

5164
02:26:04,560 --> 02:26:07,180
It's a tank that's
filled with water and a,

5165
02:26:07,210 --> 02:26:08,850
you've ever seen the movie altered states?

5166
02:26:09,030 --> 02:26:09,750
Yes.

5167
02:26:09,750 --> 02:26:10,583
That's it.

5168
02:26:10,860 --> 02:26:11,160
Uh,

5169
02:26:11,160 --> 02:26:12,600
is a tank filled with water?

5170
02:26:12,601 --> 02:26:15,240
The water's the same temperature as
you're scanning and it's filled with salt.

5171
02:26:15,570 --> 02:26:20,340
So there's like a thousand pounds of
salt in the water and you lie down in it

5172
02:26:20,341 --> 02:26:21,510
and you float,

5173
02:26:21,750 --> 02:26:22,890
you float your above,

5174
02:26:22,920 --> 02:26:24,080
you breathe cause your,

5175
02:26:24,090 --> 02:26:26,100
your body is a half underwater.

5176
02:26:26,250 --> 02:26:27,980
But there's so it's so dense with salt,

5177
02:26:27,981 --> 02:26:28,710
the float,

5178
02:26:28,710 --> 02:26:32,040
he closed the lid on the door
and you're in complete silence.

5179
02:26:32,041 --> 02:26:32,970
Complete darkness.

5180
02:26:32,971 --> 02:26:34,680
Your ears are actually already

5181
02:26:35,050 --> 02:26:35,760
shouldn't panic.

5182
02:26:35,760 --> 02:26:37,210
Can we leave the door open?

5183
02:26:37,211 --> 02:26:38,044
Oh No.

5184
02:26:38,080 --> 02:26:38,913
Nope.

5185
02:26:39,190 --> 02:26:40,080
How dare you not walked.

5186
02:26:40,081 --> 02:26:41,740
The walk is going on here.

5187
02:26:41,741 --> 02:26:43,420
We're learning so much
about Steven Pressfield.

5188
02:26:44,290 --> 02:26:44,561
Yeah,

5189
02:26:44,561 --> 02:26:45,394
it's um,

5190
02:26:45,550 --> 02:26:46,300
but if you are,

5191
02:26:46,300 --> 02:26:49,210
if you really do have an
issue with Claustrophobia,

5192
02:26:49,220 --> 02:26:51,370
that'd be the place to curate it
with great way to get through it.

5193
02:26:51,400 --> 02:26:51,641
Yeah.

5194
02:26:51,641 --> 02:26:54,400
You'll get through it 100% because it's
the most claustrophobic place in the

5195
02:26:54,401 --> 02:26:54,910
universe.

5196
02:26:54,910 --> 02:26:55,170
Oh,

5197
02:26:55,170 --> 02:26:55,520
sounds

5198
02:26:55,520 --> 02:26:55,820
great.

5199
02:26:55,820 --> 02:26:57,020
Separates you from your body,

5200
02:26:58,720 --> 02:27:01,120
but they're amazing at a coffin.

5201
02:27:01,260 --> 02:27:03,290
Let me explain to you what it is.

5202
02:27:03,580 --> 02:27:05,290
The benefit is when you're in that water,

5203
02:27:05,440 --> 02:27:06,490
your water is,

5204
02:27:06,500 --> 02:27:09,700
the water is the same temperature as
your skin so you don't feel the water.

5205
02:27:09,701 --> 02:27:10,391
You're floating,

5206
02:27:10,391 --> 02:27:11,920
so it's a feeling of weightlessness,

5207
02:27:12,250 --> 02:27:12,971
total silence,

5208
02:27:12,971 --> 02:27:13,691
total darkness,

5209
02:27:13,691 --> 02:27:15,520
a complete absence of sensory input.

5210
02:27:15,760 --> 02:27:17,740
So because there's nothing coming in,

5211
02:27:17,920 --> 02:27:21,100
your brain is so much more powerful.

5212
02:27:21,220 --> 02:27:22,060
It's a weird thing.

5213
02:27:22,061 --> 02:27:24,730
It's like the way I describe it as
like if we're having this conversation,

5214
02:27:24,731 --> 02:27:25,870
there was a Jack Hammer next door.

5215
02:27:25,871 --> 02:27:27,070
It'd be very hard to concentrate.

5216
02:27:27,390 --> 02:27:29,470
We would want to move away from
the sound of that Jackhammer,

5217
02:27:29,500 --> 02:27:32,110
but life is a Jackhammer
to Jackhammer on your ass.

5218
02:27:32,111 --> 02:27:33,130
When you're sitting in this chair,

5219
02:27:33,430 --> 02:27:34,390
like as we're sitting,

5220
02:27:34,740 --> 02:27:37,210
your ass is constantly
sending signals like,

5221
02:27:37,211 --> 02:27:37,510
Yep,

5222
02:27:37,510 --> 02:27:39,190
that's a leather chair under my ass,

5223
02:27:39,340 --> 02:27:39,581
you know?

5224
02:27:39,581 --> 02:27:39,910
Yup.

5225
02:27:39,910 --> 02:27:41,200
These are things under my armpits.

5226
02:27:41,201 --> 02:27:42,220
Yet there's Aubrey.

5227
02:27:42,370 --> 02:27:42,640
Yup.

5228
02:27:42,640 --> 02:27:43,810
There's Steven Pressfield.

5229
02:27:43,811 --> 02:27:44,030
The,

5230
02:27:44,030 --> 02:27:45,130
this is a wood table.

5231
02:27:45,130 --> 02:27:47,680
There's the shit's all
coming in and we just don't,

5232
02:27:47,681 --> 02:27:49,150
we just completely take it for granted.

5233
02:27:49,180 --> 02:27:50,260
When you're inside that tank,

5234
02:27:50,860 --> 02:27:51,820
nothing comes in.

5235
02:27:52,240 --> 02:27:53,470
You're floating in space,

5236
02:27:53,471 --> 02:27:56,680
completely weightless and in
the absence of sensory input,

5237
02:27:56,681 --> 02:28:01,510
the mind becomes supercharged because
the mind has all this resources that all

5238
02:28:01,511 --> 02:28:04,450
of a sudden are available that he thought
it was going to have to deal with the

5239
02:28:04,451 --> 02:28:08,650
weight of the body and moving along the
ground and avoiding objects and social

5240
02:28:08,651 --> 02:28:11,050
cues and all that stuff it doesn't
have to deal with right now.

5241
02:28:11,200 --> 02:28:15,070
So the mind has all these
resources free and you,

5242
02:28:15,100 --> 02:28:18,160
it becomes a very self examining self,

5243
02:28:18,210 --> 02:28:18,670
uh,

5244
02:28:18,670 --> 02:28:18,911
uh,

5245
02:28:18,911 --> 02:28:21,350
objective analysis of a,

5246
02:28:21,351 --> 02:28:22,190
of your life.

5247
02:28:22,310 --> 02:28:25,220
It almost like a seminar on your life
and then it becomes a psychedelic

5248
02:28:25,221 --> 02:28:27,470
experience and more
comfortable you get with it.

5249
02:28:27,500 --> 02:28:28,970
The more you have like visions.

5250
02:28:29,120 --> 02:28:30,650
But I think for you creatively,

5251
02:28:30,651 --> 02:28:30,921
man,

5252
02:28:30,921 --> 02:28:34,610
the things that you would come up with
inside of that tank would be amazing.

5253
02:28:34,940 --> 02:28:35,840
Once you got over it,

5254
02:28:35,950 --> 02:28:36,880
he got a couple of bucks by

5255
02:28:37,320 --> 02:28:38,153
man,

5256
02:28:38,480 --> 02:28:40,600
have a panic button put in amuses.

5257
02:28:40,650 --> 02:28:42,920
They're ready to visit tab
and start seeing Steve.

5258
02:28:43,710 --> 02:28:45,200
I'm going to force you to walk the walk.

5259
02:28:45,201 --> 02:28:46,034
Sir.

5260
02:28:46,160 --> 02:28:47,000
This is ridiculous.

5261
02:28:47,001 --> 02:28:47,834
You need to get in there.

5262
02:28:48,740 --> 02:28:49,470
Aubrey's done it.

5263
02:28:49,470 --> 02:28:50,303
He loves it.

5264
02:28:50,540 --> 02:28:50,900
Yeah,

5265
02:28:50,900 --> 02:28:51,260
it's a,

5266
02:28:51,260 --> 02:28:52,790
it's a really interesting experience.

5267
02:28:52,940 --> 02:28:54,800
I think the same for these fears.

5268
02:28:54,801 --> 02:28:56,000
There's our superstitions.

5269
02:28:56,001 --> 02:28:59,780
I've realized too that you allow these
superstitions to persist and that's just

5270
02:28:59,781 --> 02:29:01,190
another head on the,

5271
02:29:01,191 --> 02:29:02,570
on the resistance hydra,

5272
02:29:02,960 --> 02:29:03,630
you know what I mean?

5273
02:29:03,630 --> 02:29:04,020
And,

5274
02:29:04,020 --> 02:29:07,690
and I noticed this of compulsive
shit that people do today,

5275
02:29:07,700 --> 02:29:08,150
you know,

5276
02:29:08,150 --> 02:29:08,930
today was,

5277
02:29:08,930 --> 02:29:09,320
you know,

5278
02:29:09,320 --> 02:29:13,040
it's a podcast where I'm reaching them
a lot of people and so I'm kind of amped

5279
02:29:13,041 --> 02:29:13,281
up.

5280
02:29:13,281 --> 02:29:15,290
And so I was picking my Kombucha is,

5281
02:29:15,291 --> 02:29:16,100
and I was like,

5282
02:29:16,100 --> 02:29:16,251
oh,

5283
02:29:16,251 --> 02:29:17,180
which one should I pick?

5284
02:29:17,181 --> 02:29:18,230
And then all of a sudden I was like,

5285
02:29:18,410 --> 02:29:20,270
well maybe I should pick this
one over this when I was like,

5286
02:29:20,330 --> 02:29:21,050
hey dummy,

5287
02:29:21,050 --> 02:29:22,490
like stop being superstitious.

5288
02:29:22,640 --> 02:29:24,680
They're all this things
like it doesn't matter.

5289
02:29:25,080 --> 02:29:26,600
We're thinking that if
you got the wrong one,

5290
02:29:26,601 --> 02:29:28,010
you'd have a bad time on the show.

5291
02:29:28,460 --> 02:29:28,820
Yeah.

5292
02:29:28,820 --> 02:29:30,020
Maybe not all that far,

5293
02:29:30,021 --> 02:29:30,471
but I was like,

5294
02:29:30,471 --> 02:29:32,360
this one has better than the other one.

5295
02:29:32,630 --> 02:29:33,191
And then I did,

5296
02:29:33,191 --> 02:29:34,790
I just stopped myself and I was like,

5297
02:29:35,240 --> 02:29:37,280
just because there's
like a pressure to vent,

5298
02:29:37,400 --> 02:29:39,380
all these little things will come out.

5299
02:29:39,381 --> 02:29:39,771
They normally,

5300
02:29:39,771 --> 02:29:41,480
normally I'd just rip
that thing off the shelf,

5301
02:29:41,481 --> 02:29:42,350
never think about it.

5302
02:29:42,590 --> 02:29:43,580
But because you know,

5303
02:29:43,610 --> 02:29:44,181
as you said,

5304
02:29:44,181 --> 02:29:48,620
you're moving from lower to higher and
I'm trying to bring my best self to this,

5305
02:29:48,770 --> 02:29:49,603
to this show,

5306
02:29:49,910 --> 02:29:50,240
you know,

5307
02:29:50,240 --> 02:29:53,630
I was like stressed about these little
things and then I had to stop myself and

5308
02:29:53,631 --> 02:29:53,751
say,

5309
02:29:53,751 --> 02:29:54,110
Hey,

5310
02:29:54,110 --> 02:29:54,921
this is bullshit.

5311
02:29:54,921 --> 02:29:58,280
Like you can't allow these
trivial things to bother you.

5312
02:29:58,340 --> 02:30:02,540
It's just another form of resistance in
this point because the pressure's on.

5313
02:30:02,541 --> 02:30:03,560
So your mind's like,

5314
02:30:03,860 --> 02:30:07,760
oh there's a lock and omens and if
the birds fly this way or that way,

5315
02:30:07,970 --> 02:30:09,230
you got to get rid of that shit too.

5316
02:30:09,640 --> 02:30:09,890
You know,

5317
02:30:09,890 --> 02:30:12,770
these trivial fears and
these trivial superstitions,

5318
02:30:12,980 --> 02:30:13,350
you know,

5319
02:30:13,350 --> 02:30:15,470
I'm really think that
you got to cut those out,

5320
02:30:15,800 --> 02:30:16,041
you know,

5321
02:30:16,041 --> 02:30:17,240
and just ruthlessly,

5322
02:30:18,320 --> 02:30:20,120
but I'll take the other side of that,

5323
02:30:20,150 --> 02:30:21,110
getting that topic.

5324
02:30:21,400 --> 02:30:22,233
I think

5325
02:30:22,860 --> 02:30:26,370
there is luck and I think there
is funkshway or whatever it is.

5326
02:30:26,371 --> 02:30:26,581
I mean,

5327
02:30:26,581 --> 02:30:29,100
if you think about people
are getting married,

5328
02:30:29,101 --> 02:30:29,420
right?

5329
02:30:29,420 --> 02:30:34,050
A couples getting married put
in tremendous thought rossed me,

5330
02:30:35,340 --> 02:30:39,140
but doesn't everybody puts your thought
into what day are we getting married or

5331
02:30:39,141 --> 02:30:40,680
where are we getting married?

5332
02:30:40,950 --> 02:30:44,850
Are we going to get on a cliff and Malibu
or whatever it is and why did they do

5333
02:30:44,851 --> 02:30:45,061
that?

5334
02:30:45,061 --> 02:30:46,680
Because it's going to be either lucky,

5335
02:30:46,681 --> 02:30:47,850
it'll be lucky for them.

5336
02:30:48,180 --> 02:30:51,570
Or like when you're naming a
child and you're trying to say,

5337
02:30:51,571 --> 02:30:53,760
well what name am I
going to give this child?

5338
02:30:53,761 --> 02:30:54,360
Right,

5339
02:30:54,360 --> 02:30:55,081
don't you?

5340
02:30:55,081 --> 02:30:56,160
What do you think so or not?

5341
02:30:56,161 --> 02:30:57,360
You feel like shit,

5342
02:30:57,361 --> 02:30:59,970
if I gave this my daughter the wrong name,

5343
02:31:00,210 --> 02:31:04,440
it's going to fuck up her entire life has
changed with the armory or vice versa.

5344
02:31:05,430 --> 02:31:06,420
The right name.

5345
02:31:06,580 --> 02:31:07,413
Yeah.

5346
02:31:07,440 --> 02:31:10,590
So I mean you're saying
that you were saying before,

5347
02:31:10,591 --> 02:31:11,160
right,

5348
02:31:11,160 --> 02:31:14,320
that there are dragons possibly flying
through the air that we just can't see

5349
02:31:14,321 --> 02:31:16,410
you right now cause we're
not in a psychedelic state.

5350
02:31:16,770 --> 02:31:19,970
Why isn't it true that there's luck in,

5351
02:31:20,060 --> 02:31:20,370
in,

5352
02:31:20,370 --> 02:31:20,701
you know,

5353
02:31:20,701 --> 02:31:22,860
I mean certainly the Chinese
Japanese believe in it,

5354
02:31:22,861 --> 02:31:23,071
right?

5355
02:31:23,071 --> 02:31:23,461
You get,

5356
02:31:23,461 --> 02:31:24,294
I just think it's,

5357
02:31:24,410 --> 02:31:26,580
I think it's a slippery slope and it can,

5358
02:31:26,581 --> 02:31:27,414
it can,

5359
02:31:29,110 --> 02:31:29,931
it can be a virtual,

5360
02:31:29,931 --> 02:31:32,010
you look like someone
like Raffi on the doll.

5361
02:31:32,011 --> 02:31:33,210
It's somehow he makes it works,

5362
02:31:33,211 --> 02:31:35,130
but he's got a tie in retires shoe,

5363
02:31:35,310 --> 02:31:35,611
you know,

5364
02:31:35,611 --> 02:31:37,560
12 times to get it right.

5365
02:31:37,590 --> 02:31:37,831
You know,

5366
02:31:37,831 --> 02:31:38,670
if he doesn't get it right,

5367
02:31:38,671 --> 02:31:39,660
he's not going to play that point.

5368
02:31:39,661 --> 02:31:40,200
Right.

5369
02:31:40,200 --> 02:31:40,411
You know,

5370
02:31:40,411 --> 02:31:41,640
and he's going to have you get,

5371
02:31:41,641 --> 02:31:44,460
you can bring it to
its logical conclusion.

5372
02:31:44,461 --> 02:31:45,560
You can take it to floats.

5373
02:31:45,561 --> 02:31:45,700
Yeah.

5374
02:31:45,700 --> 02:31:49,860
It's logical conclusion is always in the
realm of wackiness that there's nothing

5375
02:31:49,861 --> 02:31:50,610
there.

5376
02:31:50,610 --> 02:31:50,941
Sure.

5377
02:31:50,941 --> 02:31:51,251
You know,

5378
02:31:51,251 --> 02:31:51,690
I,

5379
02:31:51,690 --> 02:31:52,441
I can't prove it,

5380
02:31:52,441 --> 02:31:53,360
but I think they're shopping.

5381
02:31:53,361 --> 02:31:54,960
I think it has to do a lot more.

5382
02:31:54,961 --> 02:31:55,231
I mean,

5383
02:31:55,231 --> 02:31:55,281
I,

5384
02:31:55,281 --> 02:31:58,210
I think it has a lot more to do
with your own kind of intent.

5385
02:31:58,230 --> 02:31:58,650
You know,

5386
02:31:58,650 --> 02:31:59,371
when I go to Vegas,

5387
02:31:59,371 --> 02:32:01,410
the only game I like to play is crap.

5388
02:32:01,411 --> 02:32:04,080
So anybody who's played enough
craps and rolled the dice,

5389
02:32:04,081 --> 02:32:05,160
you gotta be a little bit,

5390
02:32:05,270 --> 02:32:06,690
you've got to believe in La a little bit.

5391
02:32:06,720 --> 02:32:06,940
I mean,

5392
02:32:06,940 --> 02:32:09,960
you'll feel these moments
where you just feel invincible.

5393
02:32:10,310 --> 02:32:10,940
Cool you.

5394
02:32:10,940 --> 02:32:12,300
I was out pool tool as well.

5395
02:32:12,301 --> 02:32:12,601
There's,

5396
02:32:12,601 --> 02:32:15,060
there's some guys who a w
when you play nine ball,

5397
02:32:15,061 --> 02:32:17,190
I play in a lot of
tournaments and nine balls.

5398
02:32:17,340 --> 02:32:19,110
There's a lot of luck
involved in nine ball.

5399
02:32:19,111 --> 02:32:21,480
There's a lot of skill because
he played from one to nine,

5400
02:32:21,690 --> 02:32:23,790
but any ball that goes in,

5401
02:32:23,791 --> 02:32:25,920
even if you don't make it on purpose,

5402
02:32:25,980 --> 02:32:27,780
it counts including the nine ball,

5403
02:32:27,781 --> 02:32:28,830
which is the game winning ball.

5404
02:32:29,160 --> 02:32:32,010
So there's some guys that just
ride the nine ball like he,

5405
02:32:32,040 --> 02:32:33,400
they get ball in hand when they scratch.

5406
02:32:33,401 --> 02:32:36,230
So they'll set up a ball behind another
ball and just whacked that ball and the

5407
02:32:36,231 --> 02:32:39,090
nine ball hoping it bounces around
the table and falls in somewhere.

5408
02:32:39,091 --> 02:32:39,601
Because if it does,

5409
02:32:39,601 --> 02:32:40,350
they win.

5410
02:32:40,350 --> 02:32:43,290
And there's this one motherfucker that
I play in this front of it with that

5411
02:32:43,291 --> 02:32:47,610
drives everybody crazy because
every time he gets cue ball in hand,

5412
02:32:47,790 --> 02:32:49,920
it doesn't matter if there's
three balls in the table,

5413
02:32:49,921 --> 02:32:50,754
one of them is the nine,

5414
02:32:50,910 --> 02:32:54,660
he sends up all in it and I
wax it and lets it fly her out.

5415
02:32:54,840 --> 02:32:57,060
But when he's on a hot streak,

5416
02:32:57,150 --> 02:32:58,170
they fall,

5417
02:32:58,230 --> 02:32:59,730
they fall like rain.

5418
02:32:59,910 --> 02:33:00,241
And it's,

5419
02:33:00,241 --> 02:33:03,120
I've seen it happen and I've
seen this where people go,

5420
02:33:03,160 --> 02:33:04,170
motherfucker,

5421
02:33:04,560 --> 02:33:04,951
this guy,

5422
02:33:04,951 --> 02:33:06,420
just one again.

5423
02:33:06,540 --> 02:33:06,661
Uh,

5424
02:33:06,661 --> 02:33:07,051
you know,

5425
02:33:07,051 --> 02:33:09,390
and he won by just total luck.

5426
02:33:09,391 --> 02:33:10,800
Just crashing the balls together.

5427
02:33:10,920 --> 02:33:14,370
And that nine ball finds a way
into a hole somewhere and he,

5428
02:33:14,371 --> 02:33:15,181
when he's on,

5429
02:33:15,181 --> 02:33:16,080
it's tangible.

5430
02:33:16,220 --> 02:33:16,710
Yeah.

5431
02:33:16,710 --> 02:33:16,960
And,

5432
02:33:16,960 --> 02:33:18,560
and to me the distinction is,

5433
02:33:18,680 --> 02:33:20,570
is you're putting out your own internet,

5434
02:33:20,720 --> 02:33:21,060
you know,

5435
02:33:21,060 --> 02:33:22,160
and I think there it is,

5436
02:33:22,370 --> 02:33:24,080
there is a key in the universe there.

5437
02:33:24,081 --> 02:33:24,914
There's kind of a,

5438
02:33:25,040 --> 02:33:29,570
an access point where if you put your
intent and put your belief in into that,

5439
02:33:29,571 --> 02:33:30,560
whether you're rolling dice,

5440
02:33:30,890 --> 02:33:31,581
I do,

5441
02:33:31,581 --> 02:33:32,750
and it gets a little fuzzy here,

5442
02:33:32,751 --> 02:33:35,000
but I believe that there
are some forces at work,

5443
02:33:35,001 --> 02:33:40,001
this kind of momentum force that causes
seemingly chance events to more line up

5444
02:33:40,311 --> 02:33:41,144
in your way.

5445
02:33:41,210 --> 02:33:43,130
And I know this is a
very controversial topic,

5446
02:33:43,131 --> 02:33:45,260
but it just feels that's the way I can't,

5447
02:33:45,261 --> 02:33:46,280
I couldn't prove it of course,

5448
02:33:46,281 --> 02:33:49,280
but that's the way it feels to
me when I'm in those moments.

5449
02:33:49,281 --> 02:33:50,060
You know where,

5450
02:33:50,060 --> 02:33:53,600
where he feels like you can control things
that you would think are out of your

5451
02:33:53,601 --> 02:33:55,970
control by the will of
your own intent and belief.

5452
02:33:55,971 --> 02:33:56,540
And that's,

5453
02:33:56,540 --> 02:33:56,751
you know,

5454
02:33:56,751 --> 02:33:57,710
not just my belief.

5455
02:33:57,711 --> 02:34:00,840
That's the belief of many of
the shamanistic cultures that

5456
02:34:02,520 --> 02:34:03,450
that's really interesting.

5457
02:34:03,451 --> 02:34:05,190
That can't be statistically proven.

5458
02:34:05,310 --> 02:34:06,061
What's really interesting,

5459
02:34:06,061 --> 02:34:07,850
I had a Sam Harris on the podcast.

5460
02:34:07,851 --> 02:34:08,020
He's,

5461
02:34:08,020 --> 02:34:11,370
he's coming back again at the end of this
month and he was talking about the hot

5462
02:34:11,371 --> 02:34:11,960
hand,

5463
02:34:11,960 --> 02:34:14,430
a phenomena of basketball.

5464
02:34:14,610 --> 02:34:15,510
We're guys just,

5465
02:34:15,600 --> 02:34:16,440
just all net.

5466
02:34:16,890 --> 02:34:17,500
Oh,

5467
02:34:17,500 --> 02:34:19,480
they just can't miss statistically.

5468
02:34:19,481 --> 02:34:20,314
It's not real.

5469
02:34:20,320 --> 02:34:20,561
Well,

5470
02:34:20,561 --> 02:34:20,690
no.

5471
02:34:20,690 --> 02:34:21,001
Did that,

5472
02:34:21,001 --> 02:34:21,521
that study,

5473
02:34:21,521 --> 02:34:24,490
I have a big problem with that study
because the way they helped me,

5474
02:34:24,520 --> 02:34:29,140
the way they did that study
as they measured the hot
hand by when three baskets

5475
02:34:29,141 --> 02:34:29,974
in a row when it,

5476
02:34:30,410 --> 02:34:30,640
well,

5477
02:34:30,640 --> 02:34:32,920
anybody who's played
basketball knows I can be,

5478
02:34:33,010 --> 02:34:36,220
have my head in my ass and
make three baskets in a row.

5479
02:34:36,340 --> 02:34:37,810
It doesn't mean I have the hot hand.

5480
02:34:38,020 --> 02:34:40,600
Only you know when you have the hot hand,

5481
02:34:40,840 --> 02:34:41,860
like you feel it,

5482
02:34:41,861 --> 02:34:43,150
it feels sensibly different.

5483
02:34:43,210 --> 02:34:44,140
Same like in pool.

5484
02:34:44,141 --> 02:34:46,330
If you are going to measure
people who are on a,

5485
02:34:46,331 --> 02:34:48,400
on the role and pool and measuring it by,

5486
02:34:48,401 --> 02:34:48,641
okay.

5487
02:34:48,641 --> 02:34:50,760
The person who after they run five,

5488
02:34:50,770 --> 02:34:51,760
four or five balls,

5489
02:34:51,761 --> 02:34:54,820
well it could have been an easy
run that you just hit five balls.

5490
02:34:54,840 --> 02:34:55,030
Yeah.

5491
02:34:55,030 --> 02:34:57,600
When you're in the zone and
you're really feeling it,

5492
02:34:57,601 --> 02:34:58,540
it's a different thing.

5493
02:34:58,570 --> 02:34:59,381
You're absolutely right.

5494
02:34:59,381 --> 02:35:00,160
So they have to,

5495
02:35:00,160 --> 02:35:03,160
you'd have to basically go to
basketball players and say are,

5496
02:35:03,161 --> 02:35:03,371
you know,

5497
02:35:03,371 --> 02:35:04,360
they'd have to hold up a little,

5498
02:35:04,361 --> 02:35:05,200
push a little button,

5499
02:35:05,201 --> 02:35:05,530
you know,

5500
02:35:05,530 --> 02:35:05,930
and he know.

5501
02:35:05,930 --> 02:35:08,660
The problem with that is
that it would fuck up.

5502
02:35:08,661 --> 02:35:09,494
There's all,

5503
02:35:09,530 --> 02:35:11,150
there's moments that you have in food,

5504
02:35:11,151 --> 02:35:11,391
right?

5505
02:35:11,391 --> 02:35:11,750
Yeah,

5506
02:35:11,750 --> 02:35:13,310
there was a moment I was playing in pool.

5507
02:35:13,360 --> 02:35:13,730
Uh,

5508
02:35:13,730 --> 02:35:15,610
it was me and my friend Eric [inaudible].

5509
02:35:15,650 --> 02:35:15,891
Eric,

5510
02:35:15,891 --> 02:35:17,090
Chris is the guy who,

5511
02:35:17,091 --> 02:35:17,340
uh,

5512
02:35:17,340 --> 02:35:18,230
he's a Q maker,

5513
02:35:18,231 --> 02:35:19,190
make sugar tree cues.

5514
02:35:19,650 --> 02:35:24,230
We were playing and I was fucking
running out like every time I got to the

5515
02:35:24,231 --> 02:35:24,800
table,

5516
02:35:24,800 --> 02:35:25,760
if you left me a shot,

5517
02:35:25,761 --> 02:35:28,790
I was running out like a pro and
we're playing on a tight diamond.

5518
02:35:28,910 --> 02:35:29,750
But it was craziness.

5519
02:35:29,751 --> 02:35:30,080
I just,

5520
02:35:30,080 --> 02:35:30,920
I couldn't miss,

5521
02:35:31,070 --> 02:35:33,440
I just had have this
feel of where the ball,

5522
02:35:33,530 --> 02:35:37,460
we had been playing for like seven hours
and I was just completely lubed up high

5523
02:35:37,461 --> 02:35:39,350
as all hell.

5524
02:35:39,770 --> 02:35:41,840
And I just had this zone.

5525
02:35:41,841 --> 02:35:43,880
I had this feel for
where the ball was going.

5526
02:35:43,881 --> 02:35:45,590
I knew exactly where it
was going at all times.

5527
02:35:45,830 --> 02:35:46,850
I can't do it forever.

5528
02:35:46,970 --> 02:35:49,970
And then the next day I played again and
I was terrible for like the first two

5529
02:35:49,971 --> 02:35:52,580
hour only had two hours to play that
time and I couldn't get it back.

5530
02:35:52,660 --> 02:35:53,493
A good was gone,

5531
02:35:53,570 --> 02:35:55,940
but I know it was there the
night before it was there.

5532
02:35:55,941 --> 02:35:56,241
Man.

5533
02:35:56,241 --> 02:35:56,661
It was there.

5534
02:35:56,661 --> 02:35:57,890
And because even he was going,

5535
02:35:57,891 --> 02:35:58,724
Jesus Christ,

5536
02:35:58,800 --> 02:36:00,320
like I never seen you play as good before.

5537
02:36:00,321 --> 02:36:00,591
I'd be like,

5538
02:36:00,591 --> 02:36:01,700
I've never played this good before.

5539
02:36:02,000 --> 02:36:02,811
It's never happened.

5540
02:36:02,811 --> 02:36:03,740
But I'm in that thing.

5541
02:36:03,910 --> 02:36:04,280
I know.

5542
02:36:04,280 --> 02:36:05,450
I know how to do it right now.

5543
02:36:05,990 --> 02:36:08,180
It's locked in to zone.

5544
02:36:08,660 --> 02:36:10,040
What is Daniel only feel it?

5545
02:36:10,130 --> 02:36:10,830
What is that?

5546
02:36:10,830 --> 02:36:11,120
What?

5547
02:36:11,120 --> 02:36:11,630
That zone.

5548
02:36:11,630 --> 02:36:12,261
Who knows?

5549
02:36:12,261 --> 02:36:12,591
You know,

5550
02:36:12,591 --> 02:36:13,140
I made it.

5551
02:36:13,140 --> 02:36:14,590
Look just what you're talking about Joe,

5552
02:36:14,600 --> 02:36:16,040
you get into that place where the,

5553
02:36:16,080 --> 02:36:16,370
the,

5554
02:36:16,370 --> 02:36:17,203
the uh,

5555
02:36:17,210 --> 02:36:18,620
the mind boy goes away.

5556
02:36:18,650 --> 02:36:20,030
That's not loving your tapping.

5557
02:36:20,410 --> 02:36:21,110
That's not luck.

5558
02:36:21,110 --> 02:36:21,261
No,

5559
02:36:21,261 --> 02:36:22,250
I don't think it is luck.

5560
02:36:22,251 --> 02:36:22,760
That's,

5561
02:36:22,760 --> 02:36:23,060
I don't,

5562
02:36:23,060 --> 02:36:23,960
I'm not sure what it is,

5563
02:36:23,961 --> 02:36:28,310
but something lines up with something
because we've all been there one way or

5564
02:36:28,311 --> 02:36:28,581
another.

5565
02:36:28,581 --> 02:36:32,810
Stephen King saying that he didn't even
remember certain books that he wrote

5566
02:36:32,840 --> 02:36:33,471
because he,

5567
02:36:33,471 --> 02:36:34,340
that's where he was.

5568
02:36:34,430 --> 02:36:35,090
That lockers,

5569
02:36:35,090 --> 02:36:35,923
that cocaine,

5570
02:36:37,720 --> 02:36:38,620
whatever the zone is,

5571
02:36:40,050 --> 02:36:41,840
cocaine is never connected.

5572
02:36:41,841 --> 02:36:42,674
The luck.

5573
02:36:44,200 --> 02:36:44,680
Yeah,

5574
02:36:44,680 --> 02:36:45,510
that's zone.

5575
02:36:45,510 --> 02:36:46,830
It's your authentic swing.

5576
02:36:46,831 --> 02:36:50,580
It's when you're really in the doing what
it is that you do and nothing else is

5577
02:36:50,581 --> 02:36:51,414
blocking you.

5578
02:36:51,710 --> 02:36:51,831
Well,

5579
02:36:51,831 --> 02:36:52,460
sort of.

5580
02:36:52,460 --> 02:36:53,990
It's also with pool.

5581
02:36:54,140 --> 02:36:54,590
It's,

5582
02:36:54,590 --> 02:36:55,100
um,

5583
02:36:55,100 --> 02:36:58,320
it's processing information
because there is information,

5584
02:36:58,321 --> 02:36:59,930
information's coming back from the queue,

5585
02:37:00,200 --> 02:37:02,240
there's information that's
coming back from your arm,

5586
02:37:02,360 --> 02:37:03,260
your hands,

5587
02:37:03,380 --> 02:37:07,310
and then when you processed that
information over a long period of time,

5588
02:37:07,311 --> 02:37:12,311
then you get so much data that you really
understand the dynamics of the table.

5589
02:37:13,011 --> 02:37:14,930
You'll really understand
the mechanics of your,

5590
02:37:15,590 --> 02:37:17,990
you really understand how hard exactly.

5591
02:37:17,991 --> 02:37:20,030
You have to hit that
ball to make it travel.

5592
02:37:20,031 --> 02:37:21,800
Exactly as far as you want it to.

5593
02:37:22,070 --> 02:37:24,800
This is a weird thing
that goes on and then,

5594
02:37:24,850 --> 02:37:28,250
but there's this tipping point
moment where you're accumulating,

5595
02:37:28,251 --> 02:37:28,821
accumulating,

5596
02:37:28,821 --> 02:37:29,631
maybe it's gradual,

5597
02:37:29,631 --> 02:37:30,140
more data,

5598
02:37:30,140 --> 02:37:32,640
and then all of a sudden it hits
a tipping point where your deer,

5599
02:37:32,650 --> 02:37:33,680
they're gone.

5600
02:37:35,270 --> 02:37:35,720
And that's,

5601
02:37:35,720 --> 02:37:37,070
that's where the weirdness happens.

5602
02:37:37,071 --> 02:37:38,920
That's where I think there
is a little bit of magic.

5603
02:37:39,140 --> 02:37:44,030
I think about pool much like everything
else is that there's this mindset that

5604
02:37:44,031 --> 02:37:47,330
must be maintained and if you
think you're going to miss,

5605
02:37:47,420 --> 02:37:48,620
you'll fucking miss.

5606
02:37:48,890 --> 02:37:50,270
There's a weird thing about pool.

5607
02:37:50,271 --> 02:37:51,170
You could line it up,

5608
02:37:51,171 --> 02:37:51,680
right?

5609
02:37:51,680 --> 02:37:52,670
Everything's telling you like,

5610
02:37:52,671 --> 02:37:53,121
fuck,

5611
02:37:53,121 --> 02:37:54,740
I'm going to mess by blank.

5612
02:37:54,800 --> 02:37:55,633
And you miss.

5613
02:37:55,780 --> 02:37:56,810
It's weird.

5614
02:37:56,840 --> 02:37:57,230
It's,

5615
02:37:57,230 --> 02:37:59,390
it seems like it's such
a straightforward thing.

5616
02:37:59,570 --> 02:38:00,630
The arm moves straight,

5617
02:38:00,631 --> 02:38:01,461
it hits into the ball,

5618
02:38:01,461 --> 02:38:02,360
the ball goes straight.

5619
02:38:02,660 --> 02:38:03,110
Nope.

5620
02:38:03,110 --> 02:38:04,220
If you think you're going to miss,

5621
02:38:04,250 --> 02:38:06,230
if you decide right
before you're doing it,

5622
02:38:06,350 --> 02:38:06,741
fuck,

5623
02:38:06,741 --> 02:38:07,550
I hope I don't miss.

5624
02:38:07,550 --> 02:38:08,420
You're going to miss.

5625
02:38:08,450 --> 02:38:09,740
So how do you diffuse that?

5626
02:38:09,741 --> 02:38:12,800
When that little nasty devil comes
up either in writing or in Pool,

5627
02:38:12,801 --> 02:38:15,560
how do you diffuse that
little voice that comes up

5628
02:38:15,590 --> 02:38:17,730
that seems to be a self prophecy.

5629
02:38:17,870 --> 02:38:18,890
How you've done it,

5630
02:38:19,130 --> 02:38:19,730
you've done it,

5631
02:38:19,730 --> 02:38:19,971
you know,

5632
02:38:19,971 --> 02:38:23,060
I mean there must have been voices
at times it's say and it is a form of

5633
02:38:23,061 --> 02:38:23,601
resistance,

5634
02:38:23,601 --> 02:38:23,990
right?

5635
02:38:23,990 --> 02:38:25,070
Well the thing about writing,

5636
02:38:25,071 --> 02:38:25,401
of course,

5637
02:38:25,401 --> 02:38:26,720
this is always rewriting.

5638
02:38:27,230 --> 02:38:29,800
It's not like shoot
shooting pool and yeah,

5639
02:38:29,870 --> 02:38:30,651
one moment,

5640
02:38:30,651 --> 02:38:31,250
you know,

5641
02:38:31,250 --> 02:38:32,810
you could screw it up in a,

5642
02:38:32,840 --> 02:38:34,850
come back tomorrow and
do it a little better.

5643
02:38:35,540 --> 02:38:35,690
Yeah.

5644
02:38:35,690 --> 02:38:36,920
That's the great thing about writing.

5645
02:38:37,480 --> 02:38:38,900
So what about when
you're taking that shot,

5646
02:38:38,901 --> 02:38:39,081
Joe,

5647
02:38:39,081 --> 02:38:40,730
and you get that little nasty voice.

5648
02:38:40,800 --> 02:38:41,240
How do you

5649
02:38:41,240 --> 02:38:42,160
reset yourself?

5650
02:38:42,260 --> 02:38:43,093
I stop,

5651
02:38:43,390 --> 02:38:44,223
I stop.

5652
02:38:44,420 --> 02:38:45,920
I stopped the voice first of all.

5653
02:38:45,921 --> 02:38:46,470
And a,

5654
02:38:46,470 --> 02:38:48,080
I usually sit up for a second,

5655
02:38:48,350 --> 02:38:49,520
stroke my cue again,

5656
02:38:49,521 --> 02:38:50,090
put it down.

5657
02:38:50,090 --> 02:38:51,960
I go through like the whole reset through.

5658
02:38:52,170 --> 02:38:53,420
That's a very important thing.

5659
02:38:53,421 --> 02:38:55,490
Professionals will tell you
that people actually coach that.

5660
02:38:55,491 --> 02:38:55,881
Like Max.

5661
02:38:55,881 --> 02:38:56,750
I really coaches that,

5662
02:38:57,020 --> 02:38:57,261
that,

5663
02:38:57,261 --> 02:38:57,471
uh,

5664
02:38:57,471 --> 02:38:58,460
when you're down a shot,

5665
02:38:58,461 --> 02:38:59,181
if you don't like it,

5666
02:38:59,181 --> 02:39:02,360
stand up and then begin your
whole pre shot ritual again,

5667
02:39:02,390 --> 02:39:03,470
get back into position.

5668
02:39:03,471 --> 02:39:05,600
Make sure your arms in
line you accusing in line.

5669
02:39:05,810 --> 02:39:07,430
Go back again and
approach it the same way.

5670
02:39:07,431 --> 02:39:09,260
Don't ever take a shot where
you think you're going to miss,

5671
02:39:09,380 --> 02:39:10,370
but I've done it.

5672
02:39:10,680 --> 02:39:11,600
I'll do it tonight.

5673
02:39:11,630 --> 02:39:12,230
You know,

5674
02:39:12,230 --> 02:39:13,580
I do it every time I play.

5675
02:39:13,780 --> 02:39:14,151
It's like,

5676
02:39:14,151 --> 02:39:14,700
it's,

5677
02:39:14,700 --> 02:39:15,080
it's,

5678
02:39:15,080 --> 02:39:15,291
it's,

5679
02:39:15,291 --> 02:39:15,771
like I said,

5680
02:39:15,771 --> 02:39:16,640
it's a swim.

5681
02:39:16,760 --> 02:39:17,780
It's not a mountain climb.

5682
02:39:18,020 --> 02:39:19,760
You don't get to the
time of plants a flag.

5683
02:39:19,760 --> 02:39:20,720
You never win.

5684
02:39:20,870 --> 02:39:21,680
You never win.

5685
02:39:21,680 --> 02:39:22,670
You never win with anything.

5686
02:39:22,671 --> 02:39:23,660
You just gotta keep going.

5687
02:39:23,930 --> 02:39:24,401
You'll Gig,

5688
02:39:24,401 --> 02:39:25,880
you get way better than you used to be.

5689
02:39:26,030 --> 02:39:26,721
But there's still,

5690
02:39:26,721 --> 02:39:27,050
if you're,

5691
02:39:27,050 --> 02:39:28,370
as long as you're pushing yourself,

5692
02:39:28,550 --> 02:39:29,870
as long as you just
still trying to create,

5693
02:39:29,871 --> 02:39:32,180
as long as you still trying
to get movement going,

5694
02:39:32,480 --> 02:39:32,990
you're gonna,

5695
02:39:32,990 --> 02:39:34,100
it's not gonna work all the time.

5696
02:39:34,101 --> 02:39:35,720
This is going to be flubs.

5697
02:39:35,900 --> 02:39:38,810
But those flubs I love him because those,

5698
02:39:38,930 --> 02:39:41,130
those signal growth
moments for me that the,

5699
02:39:41,140 --> 02:39:41,271
the,

5700
02:39:41,271 --> 02:39:41,410
the,

5701
02:39:41,410 --> 02:39:43,790
at least that's how I have a managed to,

5702
02:39:44,160 --> 02:39:44,440
to,

5703
02:39:44,440 --> 02:39:44,690
to,

5704
02:39:44,690 --> 02:39:45,620
to navigate them.

5705
02:39:45,770 --> 02:39:47,090
Every time I fucked something up,

5706
02:39:47,091 --> 02:39:51,050
like I can look back in my career as a
comedian and my biggest growth periods

5707
02:39:51,051 --> 02:39:53,600
came after I fucking ate
a plate of shit on stage.

5708
02:39:54,020 --> 02:39:54,500
And then I'm like,

5709
02:39:54,500 --> 02:39:54,711
Ooh,

5710
02:39:54,711 --> 02:39:56,300
I don't want to do that ever again.

5711
02:39:56,510 --> 02:40:00,070
And then I figured it out and even like
weird sets today like that or it was

5712
02:40:00,071 --> 02:40:03,470
like mediocre or I don't like see
things didn't come together right.

5713
02:40:03,471 --> 02:40:05,570
Or I was tired or I
wasn't in comedy shape.

5714
02:40:05,840 --> 02:40:07,730
Who does things fucking fire me up,

5715
02:40:07,731 --> 02:40:07,941
man.

5716
02:40:07,941 --> 02:40:09,510
Nothing makes me want
to write more or not.

5717
02:40:09,511 --> 02:40:10,700
That makes me want to perform more.

5718
02:40:11,640 --> 02:40:12,060
Yeah,

5719
02:40:12,060 --> 02:40:12,331
no,

5720
02:40:12,331 --> 02:40:13,164
I hear Ya.

5721
02:40:13,530 --> 02:40:14,580
I hear you're 100%

5722
02:40:16,150 --> 02:40:16,870
well listen man,

5723
02:40:16,870 --> 02:40:18,670
I think this is a long enough podcast.

5724
02:40:18,830 --> 02:40:19,900
It was an awesome one.

5725
02:40:19,930 --> 02:40:20,763
It's been an honor.

5726
02:40:20,800 --> 02:40:21,940
How'd you find out about us?

5727
02:40:22,000 --> 02:40:22,590
Who told you that?

5728
02:40:22,590 --> 02:40:23,191
We were talking about,

5729
02:40:23,191 --> 02:40:23,460
yeah.

5730
02:40:23,460 --> 02:40:24,180
Uh,

5731
02:40:24,180 --> 02:40:27,900
well I related to people all the time
who are big fans of your podcast,

5732
02:40:27,901 --> 02:40:28,500
you know,

5733
02:40:28,500 --> 02:40:28,801
and they say,

5734
02:40:28,801 --> 02:40:29,051
Oh,

5735
02:40:29,051 --> 02:40:30,060
a a gel rogue.

5736
02:40:30,080 --> 02:40:30,901
He's fantastic,

5737
02:40:30,901 --> 02:40:31,440
you know?

5738
02:40:31,440 --> 02:40:36,440
But also I think we've been in touch
via Kelly out ensure a right moms,

5739
02:40:36,540 --> 02:40:37,530
my publicity gal.

5740
02:40:37,920 --> 02:40:38,820
And uh,

5741
02:40:38,850 --> 02:40:39,241
you know,

5742
02:40:39,241 --> 02:40:39,691
I think,

5743
02:40:39,691 --> 02:40:40,524
uh,

5744
02:40:40,620 --> 02:40:40,771
you know,

5745
02:40:40,771 --> 02:40:41,371
people have said to me,

5746
02:40:41,371 --> 02:40:41,521
hey,

5747
02:40:41,521 --> 02:40:42,960
Joe was always talking about your books.

5748
02:40:42,961 --> 02:40:43,860
You've got to get on the show,

5749
02:40:43,861 --> 02:40:44,550
you know?

5750
02:40:44,550 --> 02:40:47,610
And then I think there've been a few
times when we've sort of tried to,

5751
02:40:47,611 --> 02:40:50,610
or I've tried to really go reach out and
something got in the way or something.

5752
02:40:50,611 --> 02:40:51,444
So finally,

5753
02:40:51,810 --> 02:40:52,643
finally we did

5754
02:40:53,030 --> 02:40:53,863
beat it.

5755
02:40:54,470 --> 02:40:55,430
Thank you very much.

5756
02:40:55,431 --> 02:40:57,150
It's a real honor happened with Joe.

5757
02:40:57,480 --> 02:41:00,140
It's a real pleasure to be here
with the Werewolf's Aubrey.

5758
02:41:00,141 --> 02:41:00,600
It's great.

5759
02:41:00,600 --> 02:41:03,590
If you ever have a book that's
coming out that you want to promote,

5760
02:41:03,591 --> 02:41:05,030
we would be happy to have you on again.

5761
02:41:05,060 --> 02:41:08,360
I would love it and we'll promote the
shit out of it and I guarantee you a lot

5762
02:41:08,361 --> 02:41:09,230
of people going to buy them.

5763
02:41:09,380 --> 02:41:10,550
Just from listening to this.

5764
02:41:10,730 --> 02:41:12,710
The war of art is the
one that I recommend.

5765
02:41:12,711 --> 02:41:16,360
If you're looking for a book
that's a great book on motivation,

5766
02:41:16,370 --> 02:41:18,950
Great Book on overcoming
resistance in the creative process.

5767
02:41:19,160 --> 02:41:21,650
I haven't read the authentic swing,

5768
02:41:21,651 --> 02:41:22,790
but I certainly will.

5769
02:41:22,910 --> 02:41:26,150
And I'm going to get into
games of gates of fire tonight.

5770
02:41:26,360 --> 02:41:27,500
I'm going to get into that tonight.

5771
02:41:27,740 --> 02:41:28,101
And,

5772
02:41:28,101 --> 02:41:28,730
uh,

5773
02:41:28,730 --> 02:41:31,820
anything else people need
to find you on Twitter?

5774
02:41:31,821 --> 02:41:33,470
It's s Pressfield on Twitter.

5775
02:41:33,590 --> 02:41:34,341
Do you do that?

5776
02:41:34,341 --> 02:41:35,270
I don't have something else to do.

5777
02:41:35,340 --> 02:41:36,173
I don't know about that.

5778
02:41:36,890 --> 02:41:38,660
But you don't fuck around with

5779
02:41:39,370 --> 02:41:40,200
a website,

5780
02:41:40,200 --> 02:41:41,033

5781
02:41:41,910 --> 02:41:43,260

5788
02:41:50,720 --> 02:41:53,640

Pressfield with two SS.
