1
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:05,310
Yes,
Gary Clark Jr welcome to the show.

2
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:06,570
Thank you.
How are you?

3
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:08,130
I'm great man.
I'm great.

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,790
I owe a Ari Shaffir to connect me to 
you.

5
00:00:11,791 --> 00:00:13,130
He's the one that connected me.
Yeah,

6
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:14,040
he,
he uh,

7
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:14,940
he goes,
check this out.

8
00:00:14,941 --> 00:00:16,710
He played a num for me.
I go,

9
00:00:16,711 --> 00:00:19,350
who is this motherfucker?
Yeah.

10
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:20,483
And then from there on,
I've been a Gary Clark Jr respect to 

11
00:00:22,861 --> 00:00:23,910
our,
I appreciate it.

12
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:26,003
Yeah,
man.

13
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:28,350
What's going on man?
Oh Man.

14
00:00:28,351 --> 00:00:29,184
Just trying to figure out la I came out 
here in July and just kind of figuring 

15
00:00:33,241 --> 00:00:36,270
it out man is not Austin.
Not at all.

16
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:37,260
No,
not at all.

17
00:00:37,261 --> 00:00:39,300
But I'm starting to get a little bit,
you know,

18
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,193
familiar in Austin's a couple of hours 
away on an airplane so I can figure it 

19
00:00:43,201 --> 00:00:44,440
out.
Um,

20
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:45,991
but yeah,
man,

21
00:00:45,991 --> 00:00:46,681
I'm,
I'm glad you,

22
00:00:46,681 --> 00:00:48,090
you hit me up.
Uh,

23
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:50,110
the um,
uh,

24
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,390
honey honey crew.

25
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:53,640
Yeah,
that's the one I like pop that off.

26
00:00:53,641 --> 00:00:54,810
So yeah.
Yeah.

27
00:00:54,811 --> 00:00:56,880
Suzanne connected us.
Awesome.

28
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:58,530
They're great.
They're good people,

29
00:00:58,531 --> 00:00:59,790
man.
I love those guys.

30
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:00,780
Yeah.
I ran into them at,

31
00:01:00,781 --> 00:01:01,320
um,
uh,

32
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,790
bridge school benefit,
uh,

33
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,610
Neil young thing.
And so it's good to reconnect.

34
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,620
First Time I came out here,
we did a Gig with them.

35
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:09,110
Oh really?
Yeah.

36
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:10,553
So what made you move from Austin,
which is like one of the best spots in 

37
00:01:14,371 --> 00:01:17,100
the world.
If you could pull it off to California,

38
00:01:17,101 --> 00:01:20,640
which is still one of the best spots in 
the world if you can pull it off,

39
00:01:20,641 --> 00:01:23,750
but so much more complex,
much more bullshit.

40
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:26,460
So much marty ego.
So much more traffic.

41
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:30,900
So much more actors.
Right.

42
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:33,120
That's true,
man.

43
00:01:33,121 --> 00:01:34,740
That's very true.
But um,

44
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:39,060
I spent some time in New York City.
I spent my whole life in Austin,

45
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:41,850
always wanting to come out west and we 
figured out what it's like,

46
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:42,570
you know?

47
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:44,730
And um,
so I got the opportunity to do it.

48
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,740
So I'm just how you're checking it out 
being in a few months.

49
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,380
Oh,
so he's,

50
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:49,950
there was no like specific like pulling 
reason.

51
00:01:49,951 --> 00:01:52,470
You said let me just try La.
No,

52
00:01:52,471 --> 00:01:55,590
me and my girl just decided we spend 
some time out here.

53
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:57,780
I like it.
I like moves like that,

54
00:01:57,781 --> 00:01:59,400
man.
I think about doing those all the time.

55
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:00,443
But my wife is so not into that because 
I moved that bitch at the top of my 

56
00:02:03,001 --> 00:02:05,790
mountain at one time and she almost fell
off the club.

57
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:06,953
Oh,
for real drive of the snow dog got 

58
00:02:09,601 --> 00:02:12,600
killed by a mountain lion.
It was a punch of shit happened.

59
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:13,441
Yeah.
Be My,

60
00:02:13,441 --> 00:02:14,940
I was in heaven.
Loved it.

61
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:16,690
Damn.
Eh.

62
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,513
Speaking of mountain lions,
I heard they're like creeping around 

63
00:02:23,701 --> 00:02:25,470
over here.
There's quite a few of them.

64
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:28,710
Yeah.
There you can't hunt them in California.

65
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,230
So they have no natural predators other 
than cars.

66
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,513
Right.
And there's people that think that's a 

67
00:02:33,751 --> 00:02:36,360
good idea because they keep the deer 
population in check.

68
00:02:36,361 --> 00:02:39,030
There's a good argument for that cause 
we don't have lyme disease.

69
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:41,370
It's very little lyme disease in 
California.

70
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:44,580
And one of the reasons for that is,
is that not that many deer,

71
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:47,700
especially around here,
whereas if you're on the east coast,

72
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:48,953
the east coast right now has a real lyme
disease epidemic because these deer 

73
00:02:52,171 --> 00:02:53,004
overpopulated and overpopulated dear 
means you don't get enough food and 

74
00:02:55,861 --> 00:03:00,220
they're more susceptible to disease.
And fucking lyme disease is the big one.

75
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,113
Ticks these ticks with lyme disease.
I know a bunch of people from the east 

76
00:03:04,281 --> 00:03:06,130
coast that have got lyme disease.

77
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,520
It's fucking bad.
It's big down in Texas too.

78
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:10,420
There's deer everywhere.
Yeah,

79
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:14,500
I guess that's a good thing.
But I'd be freaked out if I walked out.

80
00:03:14,501 --> 00:03:15,910
You know,
most of the time,

81
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:16,773
don't have to worry.
Most of the time they're going after 

82
00:03:18,101 --> 00:03:18,934
cats and dogs and shit like that.
They killed a lot of rabbits and small 

83
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:25,420
animals and deer.
They've decimated the deer population.

84
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:26,343
They kill most of the deer,
either coyotes get them or mountain 

85
00:03:29,471 --> 00:03:30,071
lions get,
I'm like,

86
00:03:30,071 --> 00:03:32,290
when I see deer in my neighborhood,
it's pretty unusual.

87
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:34,840
Whereas if I go back east,
like,

88
00:03:34,841 --> 00:03:35,590
uh,
you know,

89
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,930
like I have a buddy lives on a farm in,
um,

90
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,500
well he owns a farm in Wisconsin,
this fucking deer everywhere there.

91
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:44,230
So that's the type of place where you 
got to worry about ticks.

92
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:46,780
Fuck that.
You worried about mountain lines?

93
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:48,760
I mean,
uh,

94
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,590
anything that could like take a chunk.

95
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,091
Yeah.
Let me,

96
00:03:52,091 --> 00:03:54,730
I'm a little bit worried about what do 
you live?

97
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:57,250
Uh,
I won't say Pacif specifically.

98
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,190
Yeah.
And live somewhere hilly?

99
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:00,651
No,
no,

100
00:04:00,651 --> 00:04:01,484
no.
Okay.

101
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:02,443
I'll,
I'll give you an a flat lands where the 

102
00:04:03,521 --> 00:04:04,354
people are all,
they did kill one in someone's backyard 

103
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:08,740
and Santa Monica two years ago.
Yeah.

104
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:10,300
Fucking Santa Monica.
Do you remember that?

105
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:11,463
It was a big one too.
It was like 150 pound cat and some 

106
00:04:14,381 --> 00:04:17,350
dude's yard just chilling,
sleeping in his yard.

107
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:19,413
I can't do that.

108
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:21,490
Talking about something,
I was like,

109
00:04:21,491 --> 00:04:24,020
I freaked out.
I just don't,

110
00:04:24,021 --> 00:04:25,400
I just don't fuck with nature of that.

111
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:29,240
You know what I mean?
I'm not a,

112
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:30,720
you know,
I love that.

113
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,760
You know,
I,

114
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:33,790
I don't,
it's,

115
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:35,280
I respect it,
you know,

116
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:36,770
me too.
So,

117
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:39,730
um,
and you know,

118
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:41,320
I'm not really into getting eaten,

119
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:46,310
but just that phrase,
I don't fuck with nature.

120
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:53,090
We have a picture you with a guitar 
point to get the cabbage and says,

121
00:04:53,091 --> 00:04:54,550
I don't fuck with nature.
Yeah.

122
00:04:54,551 --> 00:04:55,384
Right.

123
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,240
Oh Man,
I didn't,

124
00:04:57,241 --> 00:04:58,950
you know what I mean?
I know exactly what you mean.

125
00:04:58,951 --> 00:04:59,784
Yeah.
It's dangerous man out there in the 

126
00:05:01,261 --> 00:05:03,630
wilderness and you know,
this is a big,

127
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,050
cities are great.
You don't.

128
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,433
People think that somehow or another if 
you love nature that you don't love 

129
00:05:09,301 --> 00:05:11,100
cities.
I love everything.

130
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:14,550
Cities is this beauty and everything.
You can't be close minded.

131
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:15,570
Yeah,
I agree.

132
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,990
I mean coming from where I'm from,
the Austin,

133
00:05:18,991 --> 00:05:22,350
this city and in this nice land around 
it,

134
00:05:22,351 --> 00:05:26,190
so I'd like to jump back and forth and 
be involved in both,

135
00:05:26,191 --> 00:05:29,220
but I will not fuck with mountain.

136
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,810
I don't mess with sharks.

137
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:35,020
Yeah,
I'm down with that.

138
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:36,573
My kids are going to start taking 
surfing lessons because little five and 

139
00:05:39,491 --> 00:05:40,990
seven they want to take surfing lesson.
I'm like,

140
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:41,824
that's like a bite like one bite.
Like you don't even survive if you get 

141
00:05:44,591 --> 00:05:46,900
bitten by a shark.
If you're five you serve.

142
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,480
No,
I don't fuck with sharks either.

143
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:51,640
That's it.
I would share.

144
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:56,200
I would serve the would figure out some 
sort of bite proof suit for sure.

145
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:58,820
You know,
that's what's holding me back.

146
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:00,253
Yeah,
that's definitely what's holding me 

147
00:06:01,161 --> 00:06:01,994
back.
I would have a bite proof suit and then 

148
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:05,990
I would want a big ass knife strapped to
my thigh.

149
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:08,800
So for shark did bite me and it didn't 
get through.

150
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:13,520
I just fucking fighting as well.
The fucker take that.

151
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:15,140
Take it bitch.
Yeah.

152
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,240
Yeah,
I hear Ya.

153
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,310
Well there's a lot of them over here 
too.

154
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:22,250
There's more sharks for sure.
Then there are mountain lions,

155
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,810
I think.
What did I say?

156
00:06:23,811 --> 00:06:27,380
For sure if I think,
but when you fly over California,

157
00:06:27,381 --> 00:06:31,190
like there's a lot of like helicopters 
that fly over like the Malibu coast.

158
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:32,053
They take video footage of pig has great
white sharks all the time that are just 

159
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:38,390
a couple of hundred yards away from 
people surfing.

160
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,313
Yeah,
no thanks.

161
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:42,363
Thanks.
That's a lot of helicopters out here in 

162
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:46,310
la in general.
Yeah.

163
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:47,900
Wow.
Well,

164
00:06:47,901 --> 00:06:50,450
because it's a big flat area and there's
a lot of criminals.

165
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:53,040
It's a good way to catch people put 
spot.

166
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:54,290
It's weird when you watch it,
you know,

167
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:56,260
they call them ghetto birds.
It's weird when you watch him in,

168
00:06:56,261 --> 00:06:58,880
the helicopters are flying over and they
had a spotlight on somebody.

169
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:01,250
You start feeling guilty.
You haven't even done shit.

170
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:02,460
And uh,
you know,

171
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:06,290
know I'm particularly sensitive,
I would imagine.

172
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,760
Yeah.
Especially,

173
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:09,680
it wasn't a matter of town what it 
today.

174
00:07:09,681 --> 00:07:12,680
Damn it.
How long have you been doing music,

175
00:07:12,681 --> 00:07:13,220
man,

176
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:14,150
man?
Um,

177
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:20,900
I've been playing guitar since 96.
Uh,

178
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:24,740
I always kind of wanted one and my folks
were,

179
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:28,520
I had a habit of quitting what I 
started,

180
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:31,130
you know,
like I played baseball for a little bit.

181
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:33,860
I tried to do martial arts for a little 
bit.

182
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,190
I try to do,
um,

183
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:39,750
basketball,
football and none of it kind of stuck.

184
00:07:39,751 --> 00:07:41,570
How would always kind of go back to 
music.

185
00:07:41,571 --> 00:07:42,920
So finally in [inaudible] 96,
I just,

186
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:47,060
I got in and quit caring about anything.
You know,

187
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:50,840
I got a guitar discovered urban,
I was like,

188
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,353
and that was about it.
Did you take lessons or did you self 

189
00:07:56,331 --> 00:07:57,164
taught?

190
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,440
Um,
I didn't take lessons formerly.

191
00:08:00,441 --> 00:08:04,130
Like I didn't pay anybody for lessons.
My probably should at this point.

192
00:08:04,131 --> 00:08:04,964
When my friend of mine,
he [inaudible] say she had a guitar and 

193
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:11,690
she had a band and she earned,
her band would practice all the time.

194
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:12,524
So I would hear him.
So I would go over there and check it 

195
00:08:14,751 --> 00:08:17,990
out and I'll take my guitar and she 
would show me,

196
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:20,780
you know,
like a 12 bar blues,

197
00:08:20,781 --> 00:08:25,781
kind of like a Jimmy Reed shuffle type 
thing or like a power chord,

198
00:08:26,121 --> 00:08:27,800
rock and roll thing,
whatever.

199
00:08:27,801 --> 00:08:31,070
And um,
so that was kind of how I first started.

200
00:08:31,071 --> 00:08:31,904
And I rented books.
I went to the school library and my 

201
00:08:35,301 --> 00:08:38,000
middle school library and just rented 
like how to play guitar.

202
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:40,640
Wow.
Watch this TV show,

203
00:08:40,641 --> 00:08:43,610
Austin city limits that came on,
I know Saturday.

204
00:08:43,611 --> 00:08:45,770
So I used to just sit there and figure 
it out,

205
00:08:45,771 --> 00:08:46,604
you know,
why record the tapes and go back and 

206
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:49,093
figure it out.

207
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,433
So it was essentially like the first 
thing that you really connected to that 

208
00:08:54,431 --> 00:08:56,610
you stuck with.
Yeah.

209
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:00,410
What was it about playing guitar?
Uh,

210
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:03,540
I think the thing for me was

211
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,393
mmm,

212
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:09,653
I mean I love music and I mean the 
guitar for me was the instrument that 

213
00:09:14,581 --> 00:09:19,581
could,
it could paint so many different colors.

214
00:09:19,621 --> 00:09:20,850
It was very versatile,
you know,

215
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,620
it can be loud,
aggressive.

216
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:25,320
Okay.
Be Sweet.

217
00:09:25,321 --> 00:09:26,550
Beautiful.
Um,

218
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:28,583
and,
uh,

219
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:32,250
I just thought if I could get my hands 
on one of those,

220
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,560
I would,
you know,

221
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:36,960
try and push it to the limit and,
you know,

222
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:39,870
and I really figured it out.

223
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:41,443
MMM.

224
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,700
You just play with like the full 
spectrum.

225
00:09:44,701 --> 00:09:47,100
It's different than playing an electric 
guitar.

226
00:09:47,101 --> 00:09:47,934
For me it seemed more there was more 
options than like a playing drums or 

227
00:09:54,271 --> 00:09:57,750
playing the trumpet or something.
What I mean with toys and you know,

228
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,430
yeah.
Things like that.

229
00:09:59,431 --> 00:10:01,590
So that was it.
I don't know,

230
00:10:01,591 --> 00:10:04,770
I'm still trying to figure it out.
I'm as interested in it,

231
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,740
you know,
20 years later as I was,

232
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:09,990
you know,
then that means you got the right thing.

233
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:10,973
Yeah,
I definitely found it so fortunately 

234
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:13,573
that way.
That's one of the hardest things for 

235
00:10:14,751 --> 00:10:15,584
kids,
right.

236
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:16,693
When you're a young kid and you don't 
really know what you want to do with 

237
00:10:18,891 --> 00:10:19,724
your life and your,
your whole future just looks like just 

238
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:23,593
confusing sometimes.
The hardest thing is finding something 

239
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:29,780
that really rings your bell.
Finding something.

240
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:34,420
So for you it seems like there was a 
bunch of different other options.

241
00:10:34,421 --> 00:10:36,320
It didn't get groups,
didn't really click.

242
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:40,250
And then the guitar just that was it.
Yeah.

243
00:10:40,251 --> 00:10:41,090
Well,
I mean,

244
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,210
baseball was a terrible hitter.
I was pretty fast.

245
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:47,950
Basketball was tall,
but I was stan,

246
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:48,880
so,
you know,

247
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:49,793
put me in a post and I would get pushed 
out by these huge guys and I got tired 

248
00:10:53,091 --> 00:10:53,924
of my coach going,
Goddamn a junior when he got to quit 

249
00:10:55,491 --> 00:10:56,390
being a bitch.

250
00:10:58,810 --> 00:10:59,643
So,
uh,

251
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:03,050
you know,
it was just just with music,

252
00:11:03,051 --> 00:11:04,760
it would just,
it just kinda clicked.

253
00:11:04,761 --> 00:11:07,620
It was something for me.
What martial law should you do?

254
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:09,710
A,
I tried to Quanta.

255
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:11,610
Um,
yeah.

256
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,950
Perfect bill for that.
Yeah,

257
00:11:13,951 --> 00:11:15,870
I just didn't have the patients at the 
time.

258
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,110
I really didn't.
I wish I stuck with it,

259
00:11:19,111 --> 00:11:20,310
you know?
Um,

260
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:23,130
but I,
yeah,

261
00:11:23,131 --> 00:11:23,964
I,
I didn't have the patience or the 

262
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,130
discipline.
I didn't want to,

263
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:30,120
you know,
be focused and I wanted to,

264
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,590
you know,
there's something out the window,

265
00:11:31,591 --> 00:11:33,880
I want to go run and jump out the 
window,

266
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:35,880
go ride bikes or whatever it was.
No,

267
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:36,743
they call that add.
But I call that just being a fucking 

268
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,533
person and curious.
Like there's a lot of shit that doesn't 

269
00:11:43,941 --> 00:11:44,774
occupy your attention and you're 
supposed to make it occupy your 

270
00:11:46,551 --> 00:11:47,570
attention.
Right.

271
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:49,970
You know?
Well you keep yourself pretty busy.

272
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:50,913
Yeah.
But like,

273
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:54,250
like guitar obviously occupied your 
attention.

274
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:56,013
You know what I'm saying?
It's like I don't believe in add in a 

275
00:11:58,961 --> 00:11:59,794
lot of senses and a lot of ways.
I think there's obviously some people 

276
00:12:01,751 --> 00:12:04,840
that have like a mental issue,
but I think for most people what they're

277
00:12:04,841 --> 00:12:09,841
calling add is being bored.
You just bored like school.

278
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:13,870
How fucking boring in school school's 
terribly boring.

279
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:15,890
Yeah.
I was terrible.

280
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,800
I was terrible too.
I spent a lot of my time.

281
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:20,813
Yeah,

282
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:27,110
you should stay in school kids.
A lot of time showing up to that

283
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,153
building and then immediately turning 
back around and going and doing what 

284
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,073
interested me.

285
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,560
Yeah,
and look at you now,

286
00:12:33,561 --> 00:12:36,000
mother fucker.
I'm doing all right.

287
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:41,070
But it's finding that thing and then 
going after it.

288
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,410
That's what it is.
And what school does is teaches you that

289
00:12:45,411 --> 00:12:46,244
the future is bleak in a lot of ways.
Obviously it educates you and obviously 

290
00:12:50,181 --> 00:12:54,020
for people that that go on to choose 
some sort of an academic career,

291
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:55,790
it's imperative.
Right?

292
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:57,013
But for a lot of people that pushing you
to pay attention to shit you don't want 

293
00:13:00,471 --> 00:13:03,380
to pay attention to,
it stifles creativity.

294
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,380
It's just not the best way for people to
learn.

295
00:13:06,381 --> 00:13:08,450
It gives you like this horrible feeling 
about the future.

296
00:13:08,451 --> 00:13:09,590
Like you feel like an outsider.

297
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,020
Yeah,
I didn't feel comfortable at all.

298
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:15,450
I mean I was constantly trying to figure
out what,

299
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:16,380
what,
why,

300
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,920
why am I spending so much time every day
doing this,

301
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,020
you know,
and uh,

302
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:24,420
I just had other interests.
I mean,

303
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:25,263
I,
I believe that it does work for some 

304
00:13:27,871 --> 00:13:30,000
people and,
and people need it,

305
00:13:30,001 --> 00:13:32,760
but just for me,
the type of person that I,

306
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:36,720
that I am,
I was just like already know what I want

307
00:13:36,721 --> 00:13:37,554
to be doing.
I wish I could spend my time doing all 

308
00:13:39,571 --> 00:13:40,404
the things.
Alternative schooling wasn't really an 

309
00:13:41,731 --> 00:13:43,980
option for me or anything at that point.
So,

310
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:45,490
um,

311
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:46,323
is this an Austin you were growing up?
I grew up at us in the school system 

312
00:13:49,001 --> 00:13:49,990
there.
It's pretty bad ass.

313
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:51,611
Yeah.
It was good.

314
00:13:51,611 --> 00:13:52,444
But I felt like I could,

315
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:53,843
you know,
I would much rather have four hours in 

316
00:13:56,741 --> 00:14:00,280
music class and right.
Doing something else.

317
00:14:00,281 --> 00:14:03,190
So I'm not really knocking the system.
It was just mine,

318
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:05,170
my interest,
you know,

319
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:06,093
and uh,

320
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:11,230
I think it's almost impossible to find a
style of teaching or a,

321
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:12,163
a course of study that's going to be 
really interesting and fascinating to 

322
00:14:14,711 --> 00:14:15,610
every kid.
Right.

323
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:16,833
It's the problem I think is shoving kids
in classes and trying to educate them 

324
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:25,920
like they're a product like a factory,
you know?

325
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,233
I just don't think,
I don't think the way we do it as the 

326
00:14:29,081 --> 00:14:31,450
best way to do it.
I don't have a better solution,

327
00:14:31,451 --> 00:14:33,040
so I have to shut the fuck up.
Yeah.

328
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:33,940
I don't either.
Yeah.

329
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:34,970
I don't either.

330
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:36,710
Um,
yeah,

331
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:41,180
we had to read that book.
Brave new world kind of Ooh,

332
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:42,410
trip me out.
Yeah.

333
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:46,010
Uh,
I know if I'm ready for that,

334
00:14:46,011 --> 00:14:47,510
but yeah,

335
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:48,523
dude,
you don't have a solution either of 

336
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:50,054
them.
There's a cadillac that have in one of 

337
00:14:51,591 --> 00:14:52,424
your videos.

338
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:55,600
Is that your car?
I know God.

339
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:58,490
No.
See the hate when that shit happens.

340
00:14:58,730 --> 00:14:59,563
When those stylists,
they hook you up with a car that I'm 

341
00:15:01,521 --> 00:15:02,031
like,
Damn,

342
00:15:02,031 --> 00:15:04,940
Gary Clark Jr drives a dope ass old 
cadillac.

343
00:15:04,941 --> 00:15:06,080
Nah,
I drove a,

344
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:07,003
I drive a 94 Cadillac that I think is 
pretty dope with the director of the 

345
00:15:10,401 --> 00:15:12,320
video is like no,
it's a piece of shit.

346
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:16,130
He got this,
you got this girl,

347
00:15:16,131 --> 00:15:17,700
um,
uh,

348
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:19,790
to bring her a ride.
And um,

349
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:23,810
what year was that one?
I think it was like a 66.

350
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,633
Who was so slick.
It was like if Gary Clark Jr really 

351
00:15:28,071 --> 00:15:29,540
drives that Cadillac.
There it is.

352
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,910
Look at that mother fucker.
Yeah man.

353
00:15:31,911 --> 00:15:32,744
Dude,
you look like you just stepped off the 

354
00:15:33,771 --> 00:15:35,570
set of superfly.
I know,

355
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:37,320
I know.
And you know,

356
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:39,913
and then I got back to my house and then
like got in my car to go to do whatever 

357
00:15:43,761 --> 00:15:44,990
I had to do and I was like,
man,

358
00:15:44,991 --> 00:15:48,650
this is not the same shit but fucking 
car is sick.

359
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:51,020
Yeah,
it was amazing.

360
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:56,050
How did you get to drive it?
I'm not like a hungry,

361
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:57,561
no,
no,

362
00:15:57,561 --> 00:15:58,394
no.
I drove it up and down that street like 

363
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:05,540
I like seven times.
It's so depressing what they do,

364
00:16:05,541 --> 00:16:06,090
man.
They've,

365
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:06,923
but they nailed it.
They found the perfect car for your 

366
00:16:08,901 --> 00:16:10,020
music.
Yeah,

367
00:16:10,021 --> 00:16:12,360
I know.
Like that's a soulful car.

368
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:16,570
That car has soul to it.
It's got like a,

369
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,710
it's a piece of a history.
It's a,

370
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:21,020
it's a piece of art,
you know?

371
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:22,213
Yeah.
Know you're making me feel really 

372
00:16:23,811 --> 00:16:24,644
terrible.

373
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:29,960
But you're a success with musician,
man.

374
00:16:29,961 --> 00:16:34,170
Everybody knows who you are.
Go out and get it suite six to six.

375
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:36,430
Yeah.
Cause I don't drive that much anymore.

376
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,200
I spend so much time on the road man.
Right.

377
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:40,340
So,
you know,

378
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:41,263
uh,
someday I have a nice little collection 

379
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:45,610
someday,
someday in the,

380
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:47,060
in the mind you got,
so you drive,

381
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:49,140
you drive a cadillac though.
Yeah.

382
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:50,590
Escalate or something.
No,

383
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,061
no,
no.

384
00:16:51,061 --> 00:16:52,230
I got one.
Yeah,

385
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:56,600
I got this,
this 94 Cadillac Deville when I was 19 I

386
00:16:56,601 --> 00:16:57,790
still got it.
Really?

387
00:16:57,830 --> 00:16:58,663
Yeah,
man.

388
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:00,223
Even cooler because that one's kind of a
poser car and a lot of ways his car in 

389
00:17:04,161 --> 00:17:07,070
the photo,
like you know the beautiful 66 you can't

390
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:08,840
really take that thing anywhere.
Look at that.

391
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,430
What are you gonna take it?
You got to park it there.

392
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:13,100
Some asshole with Volvo.
Volvo's going to open up the car door on

393
00:17:13,101 --> 00:17:14,200
you,
you know?

394
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:16,640
Yeah.
I would struggle to parallel park.

395
00:17:16,641 --> 00:17:17,474
That thing you're going to get looks 
from those shitheads and Prius's the 

396
00:17:19,401 --> 00:17:23,240
self righteous moral high ground people.
They're going to look at you.

397
00:17:23,241 --> 00:17:25,160
Do you have any idea?
Is it worth it?

398
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:27,560
Is it really worth it?
You're killing seals.

399
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,130
He's going to look at your shitty.
Yeah,

400
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:34,040
so look at the fucking hubcaps or the 
rims on that.

401
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:34,874
It must be in rhythm.
So those aren't hubcaps that some 

402
00:17:36,381 --> 00:17:38,930
aftermarket shit and those beautiful 
white wall tires.

403
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:44,620
But a lot of ways like your car is 
actually cooler because your car is like

404
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:47,840
a car that no one,
no one gets.

405
00:17:47,841 --> 00:17:48,674
No one wants to try it.
I they don't get it to try to like look 

406
00:17:50,971 --> 00:17:52,920
cool.
Like that car is such a,

407
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:55,770
I'm getting it to look cool car that 
it's not even yours.

408
00:17:55,771 --> 00:17:59,730
And they used it for you in a music 
video to make you look bad ass.

409
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:00,950
Right.
Right.

410
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:01,833
But your car is actually more badass 
because it's your first car from the 

411
00:18:04,681 --> 00:18:09,420
time when you're 19 you still have it 
right and you drive it.

412
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:11,430
But that's pretty cool though.
Fuck yeah,

413
00:18:11,431 --> 00:18:12,360
that's cool.
One day.

414
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:14,760
Thanks for making me feel better though.
Well,

415
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:16,980
you're more,
you're more authentic.

416
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:20,820
See like if you were like going way out 
of your way to own that car,

417
00:18:20,821 --> 00:18:21,654
but it was breaking down all the time 
and it was fucking up and that will be 

418
00:18:24,151 --> 00:18:26,280
kind of silly.
That was your only car,

419
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:29,090
right?
Yeah.

420
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:31,183
Yeah.
But I'm thinking about my car breaking 

421
00:18:34,161 --> 00:18:34,870
down on

422
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:35,540
does.
It does.

423
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:36,730
Yeah,
it did.

424
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:38,380
Well,
you got to get one of them new ones.

425
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:40,890
Those new cadillacs at fucking space 
ships.

426
00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:42,730
I saw some new thing though.
We're working on.

427
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:44,830
Yeah,
they have a bunch of new ones now.

428
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,990
Cadillacs,
got some incredible cars.

429
00:18:46,991 --> 00:18:51,991
Now they're finally,
they like something happened in like the

430
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:53,800
late nineties,
early two thousands.

431
00:18:53,801 --> 00:18:57,520
They started turning around and now they
have pretty amazing cars.

432
00:18:58,190 --> 00:18:59,110
Hello.
Well,

433
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:04,950
I know you need like a CTSV one.
Those I've been in,

434
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:10,870
I've been in a bubble and musical bubble
in a musical bubble and then,

435
00:19:10,871 --> 00:19:12,080
uh,
uh,

436
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:15,110
baby bubble,
double bubble.

437
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:17,560
Yeah.
So I'm two babies,

438
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:18,770
like being,
I'm getting out,

439
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,481
I'm here.
I am.

440
00:19:19,481 --> 00:19:21,460
So yeah,
that's like a two baby bubble,

441
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:22,323
right?
Because music is kind of like you're 

442
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,340
giving birth to an album.

443
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:26,060
Does that make sense?
Yeah,

444
00:19:26,061 --> 00:19:27,650
definitely.
That's how I feel about it.

445
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:29,980
Uh,
yeah.

446
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:32,140
Do you knew one that you came out with 
in September?

447
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:35,560
It sounds different than the other ones,
but cool.

448
00:19:35,561 --> 00:19:37,480
But in they're like,
it's almost like you were,

449
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:39,400
you know,
I'm like,

450
00:19:39,401 --> 00:19:41,800
you're taking different chances or 
you're,

451
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:44,200
you're experimenting with like different
sounds.

452
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,870
Hmm.
Well,

453
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:46,733
yeah,
I was telling Jamie when I came in here 

454
00:19:48,091 --> 00:19:50,220
and I was like,
uh,

455
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:55,490
before I recorded,
uh,

456
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:59,310
my first album on a major black and 
blue,

457
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,920
I was living in Texas and I had a live 
room where I had drums,

458
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:07,140
keys,
bass rig,

459
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:09,060
guitar,
all set up.

460
00:20:09,061 --> 00:20:11,360
And then another room I had my 
turntables,

461
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:13,310
drum machines,
uh,

462
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:18,370
keyboards all like put it like I'm going
to this pro tools session.

463
00:20:18,991 --> 00:20:19,824
So I was just making demos and sampling 
records and just kind of doing whatever 

464
00:20:22,501 --> 00:20:25,500
I wanted to,
wanted to do.

465
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:26,423
And,
um,

466
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:28,201
so for this,
yeah,

467
00:20:28,201 --> 00:20:29,034
for this latest record,
I just kind of wanting to get back into 

468
00:20:31,711 --> 00:20:35,460
that space and experiment and vibe and 
challenge myself musically.

469
00:20:35,461 --> 00:20:36,294
You know,
it's like just playing out on the road 

470
00:20:38,401 --> 00:20:41,310
every,
every night or whatever for a few years,

471
00:20:41,311 --> 00:20:43,950
kind of playing the same songs and,
you know,

472
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:45,750
trying to,
uh,

473
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:48,700
bring new life of those in a certain way
was different than,

474
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:52,870
um,
I felt like I was kind of stagnant.

475
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:54,850
Like I wasn't playing drums like I was 
every day.

476
00:20:54,851 --> 00:20:56,670
I wasn't playing bass like I was.
And I,

477
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:58,180
you know,
I want to be a musician,

478
00:20:58,181 --> 00:21:00,490
I want to be all around musician and 
push it to the limit.

479
00:21:00,491 --> 00:21:01,324
So for this latest record,
I just was able to do that and spend a 

480
00:21:05,471 --> 00:21:09,160
lot of time and uh,
so yeah,

481
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:10,870
it does sound different.
It's all me playing,

482
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,033
you know,
most of the instruments as opposed to 

483
00:21:13,541 --> 00:21:15,430
the last one was a band.
Oh Wow.

484
00:21:15,431 --> 00:21:17,350
How many,
how many different instruments you play?

485
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:22,030
Um,
I guess I wouldn't say I play them.

486
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:26,980
I mess around and some of it works.
But I played drums,

487
00:21:26,981 --> 00:21:31,720
I played bass keys.
Um,

488
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:34,300
harmonica,
percussion.

489
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:37,390
Yeah,
just kind of the foundation.

490
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,680
And did you take lessons for any of 
these,

491
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:41,743
but formal lessons?
Like once you started rolling and you 

492
00:21:44,221 --> 00:21:45,240
started becoming a musician?

493
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:45,660
No,
no,

494
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:46,820
no.
I was,

495
00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:49,320
I was a choir boy in middle school.
Well,

496
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:50,140
yeah.
Yeah,

497
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:53,430
I got a hard time for the basketball 
team.

498
00:21:53,431 --> 00:21:55,860
Just man,
they used to give me a hard time.

499
00:21:55,861 --> 00:21:57,510
So that was the formal training that I 
had.

500
00:21:57,511 --> 00:21:59,340
I learned,
you know,

501
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:03,570
scales and notes like that,
but so you can read music,

502
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:05,663
not really.

503
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,540
You put,
you can put it,

504
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:08,383
you can put a chart

505
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,220
in front of me and I'll,
okay,

506
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,073
no idea.

507
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:16,920
I have no idea.
That's so crazy.

508
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:18,620
Yeah.
Musician,

509
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:21,150
like you're,
you're a real musician.

510
00:22:21,151 --> 00:22:23,760
You have like records you with a record 
label.

511
00:22:23,761 --> 00:22:24,594
I see your shit and I saw you shared at 
the airport once a music video that was 

512
00:22:27,841 --> 00:22:29,790
playing on a television.
They're like,

513
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:34,970
you're a professional musician,
but I don't read music.

514
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:38,430
No,
but it's like me being a comedian.

515
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:39,270
That doesn't,
right?

516
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:39,931
No,
it's worse.

517
00:22:39,931 --> 00:22:42,540
It's like me being an author who doesn't
read

518
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:44,210
books,
who can't read books.

519
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:46,880
Does that make sense?
No,

520
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:47,530
no.

521
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:52,530
Jamie says no guy behind me.
He didn't play with Hendrix.

522
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:53,863
You Dj.
I got to take that picture down and put 

523
00:22:55,061 --> 00:22:56,560
a real one up.
Unfortunately,

524
00:22:56,561 --> 00:23:00,670
that's not his real a mugshot photo.
It's a real photo obviously,

525
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:02,650
but that's not the actual four.
They fucked me,

526
00:23:02,651 --> 00:23:03,910
man.
I bought this shit.

527
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:06,180
That's Rosa parks.
Real mugshot photo though.

528
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:10,050
The Elvis one is real,
but it's not really a mugshot.

529
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:10,893
It was when he went to visit Nixon in 
the White House or took a photo of him 

530
00:23:13,541 --> 00:23:14,374
for goof.
But that's just a classic picture of 

531
00:23:17,831 --> 00:23:18,664
Hendrix.
And then they put his actual mugshot 

532
00:23:20,681 --> 00:23:21,950
photo,
uh,

533
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:22,793
underneath it.
He's real photo was him with like 

534
00:23:24,311 --> 00:23:27,670
shorter hair.
It looked more like a classic Afro.

535
00:23:27,671 --> 00:23:28,504
That's like Jimi Hendrix experience when
they had those white dudes behind him 

536
00:23:31,421 --> 00:23:33,620
with the big Afros as well.
Yeah.

537
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:35,150
That's his real photo.
Yes.

538
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:36,700
See,
you see the,

539
00:23:36,701 --> 00:23:39,920
um,
the image is correct for the Mugshot,

540
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:42,310
like for his name,
but that's the wrong photo.

541
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:44,083
They fucked me.

542
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:47,500
Somebody had to tell me thank you ever 
told me some,

543
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:49,340
some dude online.
Let me know.

544
00:23:49,341 --> 00:23:50,960
Hey Dude,
that ain't the real one.

545
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:53,450
Fuck,
fuck right assholes.

546
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,950
They just got a good one.
I mean,

547
00:23:54,951 --> 00:23:58,780
that looks like the perfect arrest photo
of Jimmy Hendrix.

548
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:01,780
And he also has this looking at his 
face.

549
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:02,623
Like,
I can't believe these motherfuckers who 

550
00:24:03,721 --> 00:24:06,320
arrested me.
Where's the other one?

551
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:08,000
He,
he's got the look like,

552
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:10,310
Oh shit,
I just got fucking arrested for heroin.

553
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,300
That's a different look.
You know,

554
00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:17,030
that's,
that's the,

555
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:18,240
ah,
fuck.

556
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:20,250
I can't let,
God dammit I get tea.

557
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:22,070
I take the picture man.
Shit,

558
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:28,030
Shit.
I'm a obviously a huge Hendrix fan and I

559
00:24:28,461 --> 00:24:29,294
can't bring myself to read.
He had a former bodyguard that wrote 

560
00:24:32,421 --> 00:24:35,900
some book that claims that his ex 
manager had him killed.

561
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:40,310
That Hendricks manager not only had him 
killed but even had him kidnapped at one

562
00:24:40,311 --> 00:24:41,144
point in time just so he could rescue 
him cause hendricks is going to leave 

563
00:24:43,881 --> 00:24:44,714
his manager.

564
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:46,183
They also,
this guy also alleges that hendricks 

565
00:24:47,991 --> 00:24:52,670
manager killed hendricks girlfriend who 
was with him at the time that he died.

566
00:24:52,850 --> 00:24:55,820
Like she jumped off a building in Soho,
I believe.

567
00:24:56,210 --> 00:24:57,130
Um,
and they,

568
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:57,993
they think that they threw her off that 
building because she knew that this guy 

569
00:25:01,581 --> 00:25:06,050
had killed Hendrix.
I Dunno.

570
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:06,943
I Dunno.
Either.

571
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:09,010
You,
so you did read the no,

572
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:10,460
no,
I can't bring myself to it.

573
00:25:10,530 --> 00:25:11,363
I can't either because I don't want to 
get down some rabbit hole that I can't 

574
00:25:14,001 --> 00:25:15,620
prove.
But this guy who was a,

575
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:18,080
he was a musician himself,
he was with the animals,

576
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:20,570
I believe.
You know,

577
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:23,540
um,
what was the one hit song they had?

578
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:28,070
Um,
I forget the song,

579
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:29,173
but he was a,
he was actually a musician himself and 

580
00:25:30,501 --> 00:25:31,334
it didn't work out for him.
And he started working as a bodyguard 

581
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,600
for,
um,

582
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,273
for Hendricks and working with this 
manager character who was apparently 

583
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:42,140
like universally known as like a really 
bad guy,

584
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:45,800
like real shady.
Like back in the day of music,

585
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:47,750
you were dealing with a lot of mob 
characters,

586
00:25:47,751 --> 00:25:49,910
right?
A lot of organized crime characters.

587
00:25:49,911 --> 00:25:53,480
A lot of creepy,
like a lot of dangerous people like Phil

588
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,111
Spector.
That crazy.

589
00:25:54,111 --> 00:25:56,930
Fuck.
Yeah.

590
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,180
Yep.
I mean,

591
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:03,740
it doesn't get any crazier than that 
guy.

592
00:26:03,741 --> 00:26:05,400
And if you don't know who Phil Spector 
is,

593
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,070
you'll google him and you go,
well,

594
00:26:07,071 --> 00:26:08,930
how come his hair looks like this in one
picture?

595
00:26:08,931 --> 00:26:09,764
And it has hair.
Like he wore a bunch of crazy wigs when 

596
00:26:11,181 --> 00:26:12,014
he got arrested for shooting a woman in 
the mouth just a few years ago and a 

597
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:16,593
killer,
he picked up some woman at a bar on 

598
00:26:19,101 --> 00:26:21,980
sunset,
took it back to his mansion and shot her

599
00:26:21,981 --> 00:26:24,050
in the mouth.
Yeah,

600
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:26,660
he was crazy.
But that guy was famous for like putting

601
00:26:26,661 --> 00:26:27,494
guns in people's mouths.
He was a famous for pulling guns on 

602
00:26:29,661 --> 00:26:33,830
people and apparently it was just a big 
part of the music business back then.

603
00:26:33,831 --> 00:26:34,664
It was organized crime and just 
dangerous people with ties to organized 

604
00:26:37,191 --> 00:26:39,890
crime.
And this guy who managed Hendrix,

605
00:26:39,910 --> 00:26:43,980
Hendrix apparently wanted to leave him 
and as he was on his way

606
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:44,813
out,
that's when this guy had the Hendrix 

607
00:26:45,751 --> 00:26:46,584
kidnapped.
This is what they are alleging in the 

608
00:26:48,241 --> 00:26:49,074
book and I believe it's been confirmed 
that Hendricks was kidnapped and this 

609
00:26:52,441 --> 00:26:54,000
guy did,
um,

610
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:55,493
get him rescued the idea.
He had him kidnapped so he could rescue 

611
00:26:58,801 --> 00:26:59,650
them.
So He'd say,

612
00:26:59,651 --> 00:27:00,870
Look Dude,
you need me.

613
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,550
I just fucking saved your life.

614
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,770
That's crazy.
Fucking up shit.

615
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:10,500
Crazy fucked up shit.
Yeah.

616
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:11,610
I don't know if I could dig

617
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,180
deep and read.
Yeah,

618
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:14,740
exactly.
They don't want to go.

619
00:27:14,741 --> 00:27:17,140
There I go.
I would like to know the truth,

620
00:27:17,141 --> 00:27:17,974
but I don't,
I almost don't want to go down the 

621
00:27:18,911 --> 00:27:19,550
rabbit hole.

622
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:20,383
His name was Mike Jeffrey and apparently
he was also a demolition expert and 

623
00:27:23,681 --> 00:27:27,970
assassin for the British.
Am I six before he was a manager.

624
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:31,480
Whoa.
Jesus.

625
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:35,170
Yeah.
Whoa.

626
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,433
Okay.
I got it.

627
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:40,100
It sounds fascinating now.
I got some shit to read this weekend.

628
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:41,773
Definitely.
I don't know why I haven't come across 

629
00:27:44,181 --> 00:27:45,014
anything like that.
Music business you get kind of compared 

630
00:27:47,301 --> 00:27:50,840
to him now in a lot of ways.
Why is that?

631
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:51,733
Is it just because you're a handsome 
young black man was very good at the 

632
00:27:54,261 --> 00:27:56,870
guitar?
I think it's cause I'm handsome.

633
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,970
What is it?
What are we,

634
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:04,730
I think that's what it is,
but that's what it is.

635
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,560
But you do have like,
um,

636
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:09,590
like in num num is a perfect example of 
that.

637
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,510
You have,
that's a,

638
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:12,983
it's an unusual sound.
You know those guitar riffs that you 

639
00:28:15,711 --> 00:28:20,080
have in that and it's uh,
I can't like that.

640
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,250
There's certain sounds so you go,
oh,

641
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:24,970
like that's a carry karch sound like 
that sounds like,

642
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,520
like Hendrix,
there was a bunch of Hendrix songs where

643
00:28:27,521 --> 00:28:29,360
you can hear like Voodoo child,
a Nigga.

644
00:28:29,361 --> 00:28:30,650
Okay,
well that's fucking Hendrix.

645
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:32,570
You know,
like people can,

646
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:33,613
they can catch that sort of unique sound
in a world of people riffing in a world 

647
00:28:39,591 --> 00:28:42,830
of people making these amazing sounds 
with guitars.

648
00:28:42,831 --> 00:28:47,270
Occasionally someone can isolate like 
particular sounds like of course ac DC.

649
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:47,641
Right,
right,

650
00:28:47,641 --> 00:28:48,840
right.
You know,

651
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:51,290
you listen to ACDC,
it's like almost immediately,

652
00:28:51,291 --> 00:28:52,790
you know,
it's an ACDC song,

653
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:55,580
but you've got your own thing going on.

654
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:58,380
Uh,
yeah,

655
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:59,970
I think so.
Um,

656
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:01,043
but I,
I can understand that Hendrick's 

657
00:29:01,921 --> 00:29:06,540
comparisons,
I mean fuzzy guitars over heavy riffs,

658
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,120
black guy doing it,
you know,

659
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:11,200
um,
yeah,

660
00:29:11,201 --> 00:29:12,660
I get it.
It used to bother me,

661
00:29:12,661 --> 00:29:13,830
but I'm not mad at it.
I mean,

662
00:29:13,831 --> 00:29:16,830
it's like he's great.
Yeah.

663
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:18,750
I want to be great,
you know?

664
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:19,733
And if people have thrown your name and 
the same sentences greats in a positive 

665
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:28,200
way,
I'll take it and just keep practicing.

666
00:29:29,410 --> 00:29:30,790
Perfect attitude,
man.

667
00:29:30,850 --> 00:29:31,780
You know what I mean?
Yeah.

668
00:29:31,781 --> 00:29:33,450
That's perfect.
Yeah.

669
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:35,080
What kind of music are you into?

670
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:39,020
Um,
what am I into?

671
00:29:39,090 --> 00:29:39,923
Uh,
uh,

672
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:42,310
at the,
I'm into like,

673
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:48,250
uh,
s southern hip hop.

674
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:49,660
Really?
Yeah.

675
00:29:49,661 --> 00:29:50,650
Like,
uh,

676
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:52,533
speaking at cadillacs and stuff.
I used to drive around and I don't know 

677
00:29:56,021 --> 00:29:58,690
if y'all got like the chopped and 
screwed the stuff,

678
00:29:58,691 --> 00:30:01,540
but like I used to listen to Dj screw 
and,

679
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:04,910
um,
what's the chop to unscrewed stuff?

680
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:06,340
What's your house?
It's like,

681
00:30:06,850 --> 00:30:10,870
it's like,
it's like the music.

682
00:30:10,871 --> 00:30:13,570
It's like,
it's just slowed down and kind of,

683
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:16,253
you know,
like they'll take a lyric and like on a 

684
00:30:18,161 --> 00:30:21,460
turntable and chop it up and like repeat
something or whatever.

685
00:30:21,461 --> 00:30:24,310
And it's really kind of a headache,
trippy stuff.

686
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:25,420
So I used to,
you know,

687
00:30:25,421 --> 00:30:29,710
I listened to that all the time and uh,
so I just recently kind of got back into

688
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,630
listening to,
um,

689
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:33,641
you know,
things like that.

690
00:30:33,641 --> 00:30:38,500
Like I got Paul Walls record slim thug,
loosen the big credit.

691
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:41,940
Um,
so just like Texas southern,

692
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:44,100
I don't know if it was me,
what to do with braces,

693
00:30:44,101 --> 00:30:45,360
right?
He's got a grill,

694
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:46,860
the grill,
sorry,

695
00:30:46,861 --> 00:30:47,694
I get confused.

696
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:57,860
Oh Shit.
That's a little bit different.

697
00:30:58,161 --> 00:30:59,450
But yeah,
so I've been,

698
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,313
I've been listening,
I don't know if it's like Texas always 

699
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:04,070
has braces,
braces,

700
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:05,780
and so what does it,
how does he eat corn on the cob?

701
00:31:05,810 --> 00:31:07,400
That's my question.
I don't know.

702
00:31:07,401 --> 00:31:11,160
I think those come out.
I think you take him out.

703
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,230
Yeah.
Yeah.

704
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:15,320
That's like some shitty wears like a 
dental dam or no,

705
00:31:15,321 --> 00:31:20,321
that's when you eat some dangerous,
that's a dental dance floor,

706
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:22,730
right?
It's for eating dangerous pussy.

707
00:31:23,170 --> 00:31:24,800
That is a,
which by the way,

708
00:31:24,801 --> 00:31:26,210
if you use that,
kill yourself.

709
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:27,343
If you're even thinking about going down
on a girl and you have to throw a 

710
00:31:28,911 --> 00:31:31,070
fucking tarp over at first,
he really,

711
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:34,720
you've made some terrible choices and 
you probably never going to recover this

712
00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:35,480
stop.

713
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,313
Yeah.

714
00:31:37,910 --> 00:31:38,743
Okay.

715
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,810
Oh Man.
All right.

716
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:45,150
Come on.
That's where it's at.

717
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:47,040
Will you kiss her?
But you won't eat her pussy.

718
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:48,810
Stop.
Yeah.

719
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:50,400
He uses chaos.
Gone too far.

720
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,920
Did you live in your life completely 
wrong.

721
00:31:52,921 --> 00:31:55,470
You need an intervention,
psychedelics or something?

722
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:58,620
Psychedelics?

723
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:01,860
Um,
yeah.

724
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:03,660
It's been a long time for me on that.
Oh,

725
00:32:03,661 --> 00:32:05,280
really?
We can,

726
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:07,080
we can help you.
Jamie can,

727
00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:09,240
he knows people,
right?

728
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:09,740
No,

729
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:11,090
passing off on him.
He kept to the case.

730
00:32:11,091 --> 00:32:13,110
The cops are listening.
Listening.

731
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:14,043
Yeah.
Right.

732
00:32:14,150 --> 00:32:14,983
Well,
it's getting closer and closer to being 

733
00:32:15,711 --> 00:32:16,520
legal,
man.

734
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,020
I mean,
they just,

735
00:32:18,021 --> 00:32:20,150
uh,
they just released some new,

736
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:21,013
uh,
new financial stats on the amount of 

737
00:32:22,251 --> 00:32:24,590
money that they're making off medical 
marijuana once,

738
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:25,483
if they can,
if they can really establish that this 

739
00:32:27,381 --> 00:32:28,214
is like a nationwide way that people can
make a ton of money off taxes and turn 

740
00:32:31,821 --> 00:32:33,440
economies around it.
They haven't Denver,

741
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:35,780
I mean,
they turn the economy in Denver around.

742
00:32:35,810 --> 00:32:36,740
Do you perform there a lot?

743
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:40,160
Um,
I'm not a lot.

744
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,650
I'm trying to get there more.
Yeah.

745
00:32:42,651 --> 00:32:43,670
But uh,
yeah,

746
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:45,950
it doesn't belly up a couple of times 
and done some,

747
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:48,290
uh,
did red rocks out there?

748
00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:49,820
Oh Man.
Yeah,

749
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:51,770
a couple of times.
A lot of beautiful venue.

750
00:32:51,771 --> 00:32:52,550
That is,
Huh?

751
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:53,510
Yeah,
it's great.

752
00:32:53,511 --> 00:32:56,830
But I mean,
the vibe is killed.

753
00:32:56,870 --> 00:32:59,090
It's a great experience as far as every,
all that,

754
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,550
well,
the Denver vibe is like,

755
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:04,460
it's like some new American Amsterdam 
type shit or something.

756
00:33:04,461 --> 00:33:07,490
It's crazy.
It's this amazing city now.

757
00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:10,610
I mean,
it went from being this cowboy city that

758
00:33:10,611 --> 00:33:13,700
was filled with really cool people to 
somewhere,

759
00:33:13,701 --> 00:33:16,910
I think in the early two thousands,
I don't remember what the year it was.

760
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:19,970
They decriminalized marijuana in the 
city of Denver.

761
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:20,840
They just went,
fuck it.

762
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:22,790
We're just not arresting anybody for it.
It's a stupid,

763
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:23,953
they like you.
You could have all your state laws you 

764
00:33:25,161 --> 00:33:26,210
can have on your national laws.

765
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:27,740
We're just not going to arrest people 
for it.

766
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:28,693
Okay,
we're done.

767
00:33:29,030 --> 00:33:31,220
And so they would tell us that when 
we're working.

768
00:33:31,221 --> 00:33:32,150
They're like,
what?

769
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:32,871
I'm like,
yeah,

770
00:33:32,871 --> 00:33:34,460
they don't care.
You could smoke pot.

771
00:33:34,461 --> 00:33:35,294
And I'm like,
really?

772
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:37,010
Like yeah,
they won't arrest you.

773
00:33:37,011 --> 00:33:38,540
They publicly said they won't arrest 
you.

774
00:33:38,810 --> 00:33:41,060
So there was,
that was the first stepping point.

775
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:42,223
And then when it became legal and now 
they make more money from it than they 

776
00:33:45,501 --> 00:33:47,840
do from alcohol,
which is incredible.

777
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:50,330
They make more money in tax because the 
taxes are very high.

778
00:33:50,690 --> 00:33:53,540
Like it's 39% taxes for recreational 
marijuana.

779
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:57,590
But nobody gives a fuck because it's 
still way cheaper than alcohol.

780
00:33:57,860 --> 00:34:02,180
Like you could get $10 for the weed and 
be fucked up for the entire day.

781
00:34:03,170 --> 00:34:04,310
That's true.
You know,

782
00:34:04,370 --> 00:34:07,940
I mean,
you take one $5 pot candy,

783
00:34:08,990 --> 00:34:11,550
so what?
It's 39% taxes.

784
00:34:11,570 --> 00:34:12,620
What does that,
so that makes it,

785
00:34:12,621 --> 00:34:13,454
what,
eight bucks?

786
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:14,503
So then you,
then you take that one pot candy and 

787
00:34:17,271 --> 00:34:19,020
your barbecued,
right?

788
00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:21,410
That's one jamison.
Yeah,

789
00:34:21,470 --> 00:34:22,910
exactly.
It's one drink.

790
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:23,833
It's like not even close.
So like economically it's a great thing 

791
00:34:26,391 --> 00:34:27,980
for the city.
And once,

792
00:34:28,010 --> 00:34:31,220
once that sort of sets in that we've 
been lied to about that.

793
00:34:31,221 --> 00:34:32,840
And then all these new studies are 
coming out,

794
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,430
um,
about the,

795
00:34:34,431 --> 00:34:37,730
the benefits of a different psychedelics
for ptsd.

796
00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:41,540
A John Hopkins did a longterm study on 
silicide been,

797
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:42,613
they're doing new studies on psilocybin 
with people that are terminally ill and 

798
00:34:45,891 --> 00:34:46,910
uh,
people that are,

799
00:34:46,911 --> 00:34:49,220
uh,
they're getting towards the end of life,

800
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:50,083
you know,
older folks and it's just a alleviated 

801
00:34:51,741 --> 00:34:55,340
tension and worry and fear of death and 
in a beautiful way.

802
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:57,110
And then they'll realize like,
hey,

803
00:34:57,111 --> 00:34:58,490
you know,
we can profit off this shit.

804
00:34:58,491 --> 00:35:01,400
Like this is,
this is more money that can be generated

805
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:04,880
to help the school systems,
the fix the roads to hire new cops to,

806
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:07,040
to change the way,
you know,

807
00:35:07,041 --> 00:35:07,611
we,
we,

808
00:35:07,611 --> 00:35:08,444
uh,
address and interface with these things 

809
00:35:10,401 --> 00:35:12,110
and stop,
stop criminalizing them.

810
00:35:12,530 --> 00:35:13,191
Right.
Yeah,

811
00:35:13,191 --> 00:35:14,024
I totally agree.
I'm not as educated on all that as I 

812
00:35:16,251 --> 00:35:17,810
would like to be,
but I feel like,

813
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:19,880
um,
you know,

814
00:35:20,390 --> 00:35:22,390
once that door gets opened up,
yeah,

815
00:35:22,650 --> 00:35:24,560
it'd be a lot more beneficial than it 
is.

816
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:27,080
Uh,
he said to be,

817
00:35:28,050 --> 00:35:28,820
you know,
hurting.

818
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:29,750
Yeah.
Well,

819
00:35:29,751 --> 00:35:33,620
we're just stuck in the momentum of an 
ignorant past.

820
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:35,740
It's what it is.
You know what I'm saying?

821
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:36,653
What,
what kind of psychedelics have you 

822
00:35:37,681 --> 00:35:38,370
experimented

823
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:41,450
with Gary Clark,
Jr I spent,

824
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:45,740
are you looking at,
I just started sweating.

825
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,060
I looked at it.
It could be a cop.

826
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:50,971
Yeah.
I was like,

827
00:35:50,971 --> 00:35:51,751
oh man.
I was like,

828
00:35:51,751 --> 00:35:53,190
man,
when I walk into,

829
00:35:53,191 --> 00:35:55,720
hold on a minute.
Yeah.

830
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:59,850
I spend a little time,
I love a psychedelic mushrooms.

831
00:36:00,570 --> 00:36:01,740
It's been a long time,
but,

832
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,100
um,
I,

833
00:36:03,310 --> 00:36:08,310
I definitely have a experiment.
I feel like I've gained some things from

834
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:11,550
those experiences.
Uh,

835
00:36:12,690 --> 00:36:16,110
that's about it does,
that's a good one though.

836
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:18,070
Mushrooms and weed.
Yeah,

837
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,860
both.
Excellent combination.

838
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,540
I love it.
Well,

839
00:36:21,541 --> 00:36:22,374
keep,
Texas is a great place for it too 

840
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,353
because Texas,
there's a lot of mushrooms that grow 

841
00:36:25,501 --> 00:36:27,070
wild out there.
Yeah.

842
00:36:27,071 --> 00:36:27,901
W Yeah,
we,

843
00:36:27,901 --> 00:36:28,734
um,
we kind of have parties where we would 

844
00:36:30,661 --> 00:36:34,110
run around and go pick them and yeah.
Did you really?

845
00:36:34,111 --> 00:36:34,950
Yeah.
It's kind of gross.

846
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:36,810
Pick them off couch.
Yeah.

847
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:39,130
It's disgusting.
But how did you know they were the right

848
00:36:39,131 --> 00:36:39,570
ones?

849
00:36:39,570 --> 00:36:40,520
Oh,
uh,

850
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:42,540
I is the group of people.

851
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:43,580
Well,
I surrounding myself,

852
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:44,473
ah,
people that my mom said you should stay 

853
00:36:46,441 --> 00:36:49,740
away from them.
Those mycologists.

854
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:52,413
Yeah.
Um,

855
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,490
so it was just kinda like,
uh,

856
00:36:55,350 --> 00:36:59,830
uh,
I was hanging with the right crowd.

857
00:36:59,831 --> 00:37:01,390
Right crowd.
The right crowd.

858
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:02,890
Yeah.
It definitely,

859
00:37:03,010 --> 00:37:04,600
it turns out to be the right crowd,
right.

860
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:05,780
The right crowd.
You know,

861
00:37:05,781 --> 00:37:08,030
the ones that your mom probably told you
should hang out with,

862
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:10,340
they're on fucking antidepressants right
now.

863
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,610
Freaking out,
hitting Midlife,

864
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:14,420
wondering what the fuck they're doing 
with themselves.

865
00:37:14,421 --> 00:37:18,140
Having children being,
being trapped in some job where there,

866
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:19,133
you know,
most likely with the people that go the 

867
00:37:21,141 --> 00:37:24,770
way that everybody wanted us to go.
Like whether it's a lawyer or successful

868
00:37:24,771 --> 00:37:25,604
businessman,
they're stressed the fuck out working 

869
00:37:27,410 --> 00:37:28,670
long crazy hours.

870
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,280
Right?
Yeah.

871
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:32,850
Yeah.
I totally agree.

872
00:37:32,851 --> 00:37:36,960
I mean,
I feel like regardless of,

873
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,510
or despite the,
uh,

874
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:42,090
the tension that I had,
I mean,

875
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:44,520
I grew up constantly very strict,
very,

876
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,640
um,
you know,

877
00:37:46,650 --> 00:37:49,110
I was raised baptist,
you know,

878
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:52,530
very straight,
very strict family,

879
00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:53,423
military.
So any of that was completely taboo and 

880
00:37:58,261 --> 00:37:59,094
I would,
that would be my ass if they found out 

881
00:38:00,211 --> 00:38:02,670
anything about it.
But for some reason I felt like I wanted

882
00:38:02,671 --> 00:38:05,910
to break out and,
and discover on my own,

883
00:38:05,911 --> 00:38:06,744
you know what I mean?
And not kind of not be locked into what 

884
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:12,570
was just laid out for me,
you know?

885
00:38:12,650 --> 00:38:13,141
Yeah.
And,

886
00:38:13,141 --> 00:38:14,130
um,
so yeah,

887
00:38:14,131 --> 00:38:15,930
you're right.
It turned out being the right crowd,

888
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:21,750
not doing great.
That's just seems to be a common theme.

889
00:38:21,881 --> 00:38:24,100
Suppression leads to,
you know,

890
00:38:24,101 --> 00:38:24,934
trying to alleviate that suppression by 
this not listening well by you just 

891
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:31,510
going crazy by your exploring,
taking chances.

892
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:34,000
Oftentimes like the most strict 
upbringings,

893
00:38:34,330 --> 00:38:39,330
but deliver a child is like more prone 
to rebellion and I just,

894
00:38:40,271 --> 00:38:42,190
kids don't like to be told what the fuck
to do.

895
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:44,411
Yeah.
Yeah.

896
00:38:44,411 --> 00:38:47,170
You're there.
It's normal.

897
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:50,920
Tell me what to do exactly what I'm zack
opposite.

898
00:38:50,990 --> 00:38:51,823
Yeah.
And I'm sure you're probably going to 

899
00:38:53,321 --> 00:38:56,800
impart that into your own children too,
because you kind of remember,

900
00:38:56,801 --> 00:38:59,050
I mean,
I certainly do with my children.

901
00:38:59,051 --> 00:39:02,710
I remember being told what to do and 
just you strapped me fucking crazy.

902
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:04,730
People don't like it.
They,

903
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:05,500
they,
they,

904
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:08,620
they don't mind rules.
If the rules make sense.

905
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,221
Like,
Hey,

906
00:39:09,221 --> 00:39:12,220
don't stick a fork into electric socket 
cause he could fucking die.

907
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:13,260
Oh,
okay.

908
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:18,260
That's a big one at my house right now.
How old your kid just turned one.

909
00:39:18,370 --> 00:39:19,203
Oh yeah.
Figured out how to open the door and 

910
00:39:20,771 --> 00:39:23,040
walk like it within two days.
Boy.

911
00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:23,850
Girl,
boy.

912
00:39:23,850 --> 00:39:25,210
Yeah,
they're mobile man.

913
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:26,160
It was like,
yeah,

914
00:39:26,410 --> 00:39:27,243
Jesus.
Yeah.

915
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,720
He started checking pumps.
They wake up,

916
00:39:28,721 --> 00:39:31,360
they don't say Shit and you might be 
sleeping and then like,

917
00:39:31,361 --> 00:39:33,250
let me just fucking check out what's 
going on in this house.

918
00:39:33,570 --> 00:39:35,380
What is that Chord puck stuck in the 
wall.

919
00:39:36,010 --> 00:39:37,360
Hmm.
There's some holes in there,

920
00:39:37,570 --> 00:39:38,403
you know,
some other shit would fit in there like 

921
00:39:39,071 --> 00:39:41,770
coins and then they start sticking 
things in there.

922
00:39:41,890 --> 00:39:46,480
Blowing my mind right now anyway.
Yeah,

923
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:47,630
they're,
they're uh,

924
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:49,840
they're fascinating.
They're little people.

925
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:52,130
You know,
but yeah,

926
00:39:52,131 --> 00:39:52,964
I'm trying to,
you know,

927
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:55,110
definitely be conscious of,
of,

928
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:56,930
of that,
you know,

929
00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:58,100
as,
as he grows and,

930
00:39:58,220 --> 00:40:00,920
and,
and uh,

931
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:03,930
I wouldn't mind questioning why.
Yeah.

932
00:40:04,170 --> 00:40:06,080
There's the whole,
because,

933
00:40:06,110 --> 00:40:07,310
right.
Because I said,

934
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,310
Eh,
yeah,

935
00:40:08,570 --> 00:40:09,710
yeah.
I can't,

936
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:11,000
can't do that.
Yeah.

937
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:16,780
I can't do that to this.
It drives me fucking nuts.

938
00:40:17,650 --> 00:40:18,910
Of course.
Well,

939
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:23,940
I have a theory on all that stuff.
I think that every generation gathers up

940
00:40:24,551 --> 00:40:27,460
the information of how the previous 
generation fucked up.

941
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:28,503
And as long as there's no cataclysmic 
disasters and we're not living in Mad 

942
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:32,763
Max Times where it's like desperado days
and everyone's fending for themselves 

943
00:40:36,791 --> 00:40:39,820
and it's just about survival,
then things just keep getting better.

944
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:41,013
Right.
Well now you can pull out your mobile 

945
00:40:42,941 --> 00:40:43,070
though,

946
00:40:43,070 --> 00:40:47,180
vice and you know,
figure out what's really happening,

947
00:40:47,330 --> 00:40:48,250
you know?
Yeah.

948
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:50,210
And,
and uh,

949
00:40:51,290 --> 00:40:53,120
that's kind of a trip.
Oh yeah.

950
00:40:53,270 --> 00:40:54,103
I mean,
to kind of grow up in and just not 

951
00:40:57,471 --> 00:40:58,304
really,
no,

952
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:02,270
not have access.
Like we have access now.

953
00:41:03,050 --> 00:41:05,570
I mean,
it still blows my mind like that.

954
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:10,370
I forget sometimes that if I want to 
know something I can just google.

955
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:11,250
Yeah,
instant.

956
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:13,190
I mean it's,
it's amazing.

957
00:41:13,310 --> 00:41:14,350
Yeah.
Yeah.

958
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:17,930
So I saw something you were talking 
about these google glasses and like,

959
00:41:17,990 --> 00:41:22,420
you know,
these whole being,

960
00:41:22,430 --> 00:41:24,500
these,
I don't know what it is,

961
00:41:24,530 --> 00:41:29,000
it's a my buddy Chris was trying to tell
me about it as well.

962
00:41:29,370 --> 00:41:32,280
Well there's a bunch of different kinds.
There's the regular google glasses,

963
00:41:32,281 --> 00:41:34,040
which a lot of people have,
which is a very small

964
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:36,680
lens.
It sits on like a mock frames.

965
00:41:36,681 --> 00:41:39,290
It looks like a glass frame without any 
glasses in it.

966
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:43,220
And then there's one small window but 
that didn't really catch on.

967
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:47,720
So what they're working on now is a 
contact lenses that do the same thing.

968
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:48,531
And,
but the Google,

969
00:41:48,531 --> 00:41:49,364
the glass thing,
you had like a little swipe thing and 

970
00:41:52,251 --> 00:41:54,890
you could like swipe left and right and 
move it around.

971
00:41:54,891 --> 00:41:56,870
Like so he could go,
like I could say,

972
00:41:56,871 --> 00:41:57,704
I could Google Gary Clark images and I 
would see in that little tiny window 

973
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:04,550
images of you and I could just swipe 
through them.

974
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:08,810
You could say navigate to the Hollywood 
bowl.

975
00:42:08,990 --> 00:42:11,750
And it would take,
it would show you google maps,

976
00:42:11,930 --> 00:42:14,450
how to get to the Hollywood bowl and he 
would talk to you in your ear.

977
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,330
But people didn't like it cause it 
looked goofy and,

978
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:20,360
and when people were wearing them,
other people got pissed off.

979
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:22,310
Like are you filming me?
Like what are you doing?

980
00:42:22,311 --> 00:42:25,460
Cause you could fill them with them too.
So now they're,

981
00:42:25,461 --> 00:42:26,294
they've moved to contact lenses,
which they haven't really released yet 

982
00:42:29,061 --> 00:42:29,894
but they're working on them.
And then there's another one that's way 

983
00:42:31,431 --> 00:42:33,800
crazier,
which is like goggles and these are like

984
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:36,620
ski goggles and when you put these 
motherfuckers on,

985
00:42:36,621 --> 00:42:39,650
you're going to be able to play video 
games in three d space.

986
00:42:39,830 --> 00:42:43,430
You're going to have like three 
dimensional holograms around you.

987
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:45,770
That's the thing.
That's the thing I was wondering about.

988
00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:46,663
So called magic leap or now magically 
visit one magic leap in the Hollow Lens 

989
00:42:50,211 --> 00:42:52,520
by Microsoft.
That's the one with the goggles,

990
00:42:52,521 --> 00:42:53,570
right?
The Hollow Lens.

991
00:42:54,410 --> 00:42:56,060
But yeah.
What are you thinking about that?

992
00:42:56,090 --> 00:42:58,460
It's crazy.
This is just step one.

993
00:42:58,610 --> 00:42:59,443
I've actually been talking about this 
onstage recently because I'm actually 

994
00:43:01,550 --> 00:43:05,510
kind of freaked out about it,
that we're going to enter a world within

995
00:43:05,511 --> 00:43:06,344
the next hundred years where artificial 
reality is indistinguishable from 

996
00:43:09,981 --> 00:43:10,880
regular reality.

997
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:12,433
It's the matrix.
It's 100% going to happen if we don't 

998
00:43:15,141 --> 00:43:17,780
blow ourselves up and we don't die from 
disease.

999
00:43:17,781 --> 00:43:18,614
If we don't get hit by an asteroid,
we're going to be able to figure out a 

1000
00:43:21,861 --> 00:43:22,694
way to trick the mind into thinking.
It's experiencing things that it's not 

1001
00:43:25,851 --> 00:43:26,684
experiencing.
Whether how long it takes is just 

1002
00:43:29,031 --> 00:43:32,150
subjective,
but whatever the amount of time it is in

1003
00:43:32,151 --> 00:43:34,760
the history of the universe or the 
history of this planet,

1004
00:43:34,790 --> 00:43:35,623
it's a blink and in one blank,
you're not going to be able to tell 

1005
00:43:38,690 --> 00:43:39,523
where the reality is real or not.
You're going to be able to plug into 

1006
00:43:41,810 --> 00:43:44,540
something and you're going to be able to
have artificial experiences.

1007
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:46,880
So like we could do this like,
hey,

1008
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:48,710
yeah,
we might be doing it right now.

1009
00:43:49,190 --> 00:43:51,260
That's what's fucked up about it.
When,

1010
00:43:51,290 --> 00:43:52,123
when scientists study artificial reality
and they study what they call computer 

1011
00:43:55,641 --> 00:43:58,850
simulation theory,
they're the real mind fuck is.

1012
00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:00,013
It's hard to tell whether or not this is
a simulation and that it's very likely 

1013
00:44:05,721 --> 00:44:10,520
that it could be that our entire 
universe could be some sort of a massive

1014
00:44:10,521 --> 00:44:11,354
simulation that we're experiencing and 
might not even be like a computer 

1015
00:44:14,271 --> 00:44:15,104
simulation.
It might be some sort of a simulation 

1016
00:44:17,031 --> 00:44:19,520
that's going on,
like at a cellular level,

1017
00:44:19,790 --> 00:44:22,430
like some sort of a mass hallucination.

1018
00:44:25,610 --> 00:44:26,600
Wow.
Yeah.

1019
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:29,660
It's emily isn't enough.
It was not my theories,

1020
00:44:29,661 --> 00:44:34,050
but I think about that.
These are not my ideas.

1021
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:34,973
Oh yeah.
I don't even know what to say about 

1022
00:44:38,110 --> 00:44:38,943
that.
Think about what you said right about 

1023
00:44:40,171 --> 00:44:43,200
Google Ryan,
about being able to go to your phone and

1024
00:44:43,201 --> 00:44:45,570
have it all the answers when you were a 
kid.

1025
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:48,300
That was magic.
That was magic,

1026
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:50,610
right?
The idea behind that was insane.

1027
00:44:50,611 --> 00:44:51,444
Just 20 years ago,
1996 the idea of being able to do that 

1028
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:56,430
was insane.
Everybody be like,

1029
00:44:56,431 --> 00:44:59,360
what in the fuck are you talking about?
You're going to be to reach a new phone.

1030
00:44:59,361 --> 00:45:00,900
You've gotta be able to touch a piece of
glass.

1031
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:02,340
You can not,
you didn't have to touch it.

1032
00:45:02,341 --> 00:45:03,174
You press a button and you talk to it 
and it'll tell you anything you need to 

1033
00:45:06,121 --> 00:45:07,410
know.
Like what?

1034
00:45:07,770 --> 00:45:10,560
How the fuck is that possible?
You're going to go watch videos on it.

1035
00:45:10,710 --> 00:45:13,140
Shut the fuck up.
You're going to watch movies on it.

1036
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:14,253
You're gonna be able to play hundreds 
and hundreds and hundreds of hours of 

1037
00:45:16,921 --> 00:45:17,754
music on it.
It'll sound beautiful and it all be a 

1038
00:45:19,591 --> 00:45:22,260
thing that's so slim and sleek.
It fits right in your pocket.

1039
00:45:23,540 --> 00:45:26,490
Like we're already living in some crazy 
movie that they didn't even predict.

1040
00:45:26,491 --> 00:45:31,491
And Star track a sidetrack.
They had walkie talkies number.

1041
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:34,320
That's crazy.
It is crazy.

1042
00:45:36,210 --> 00:45:39,840
I'm just getting old.
What does this Jamie,

1043
00:45:40,620 --> 00:45:43,680
Microsoft added a new update to what 
hollow lens is going to look like.

1044
00:45:43,681 --> 00:45:44,514
This is what they think is watching.
Sports will be like in the future kind 

1045
00:45:46,761 --> 00:45:48,660
of says like what?
Watching football.

1046
00:45:49,110 --> 00:45:49,943
A football game,
right?

1047
00:45:51,830 --> 00:45:53,460
Oh you be able to watch it in front of 
you.

1048
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:59,400
All sorts of players.
You can have players in stats pop up and

1049
00:45:59,401 --> 00:46:03,240
you're like living room and get extra.
It looks really,

1050
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:07,380
so everyone's just going to sit down and
put these goggles on instead of having a

1051
00:46:07,381 --> 00:46:11,580
television or with the television.
So you'll have access to TV.

1052
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:12,533
Look at this.
I could only imagine what like a UFC 

1053
00:46:15,301 --> 00:46:17,130
event watching that would be like,
you know what I mean?

1054
00:46:17,131 --> 00:46:20,100
To get extra stats on the players will 
be really cool.

1055
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:20,993
Also,
probably we'll put a big camera on the 

1056
00:46:22,951 --> 00:46:27,690
referee so you'd be inside of it are 
watching me watching from their view,

1057
00:46:27,691 --> 00:46:28,524
you know what I mean?
Watching from any players view if you 

1058
00:46:29,551 --> 00:46:31,200
choose to,
if they can pull that off with,

1059
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:33,600
well they probably could do that with 
players.

1060
00:46:33,601 --> 00:46:34,920
It wouldn't be able to do it with 
fighters.

1061
00:46:34,921 --> 00:46:38,160
But with the pride,
they used to have a camera,

1062
00:46:38,190 --> 00:46:41,130
but they would put on the referees.
It was this crazy dorky thing.

1063
00:46:41,390 --> 00:46:42,223
It was like real big and clunky.
It was like a camera that's sat next to 

1064
00:46:44,251 --> 00:46:45,960
their head and they would,
uh,

1065
00:46:45,990 --> 00:46:46,823
they would wear that thing and it was 
kind of cool to see it from their 

1066
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:50,513
perspective,
but that was fairly rudimentary 

1067
00:46:53,161 --> 00:46:55,080
considering it was like early two 
thousands,

1068
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:57,630
like what this is going to be is going 
to be bananas,

1069
00:46:58,050 --> 00:46:59,670
but then you got to hang out with 
goggles on,

1070
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:03,770
you know,
friends have to have goggles.

1071
00:47:05,750 --> 00:47:07,580
Oh Man.
Yeah,

1072
00:47:07,581 --> 00:47:08,750
I dunno.
I guess it's,

1073
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:11,330
it's kind of like the silent disco 
thing.

1074
00:47:11,870 --> 00:47:15,620
What's the silent disco thing?
A silent disco is like where people,

1075
00:47:15,710 --> 00:47:16,543
like a whole bunch of people hang out in
a room or a club and they have 

1076
00:47:20,151 --> 00:47:20,984
headphones on and there's like,
there's Djs and you can decide if you 

1077
00:47:25,161 --> 00:47:27,770
want to go with Dj,
a Dj be.

1078
00:47:28,010 --> 00:47:31,720
And so it was a bunch of people like 
dancing in a silent room with headphones

1079
00:47:31,721 --> 00:47:34,180
on.
Really like having a great time.

1080
00:47:35,070 --> 00:47:37,720
And then it's like,
do you want to drink?

1081
00:47:37,990 --> 00:47:38,823
What?

1082
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:42,540
Oh,
is this it right here?

1083
00:47:42,541 --> 00:47:47,541
You show me this Jamie.
So this is people the dancing around and

1084
00:47:50,101 --> 00:47:52,110
they just have different wireless 
headsets on.

1085
00:47:52,170 --> 00:47:53,580
Yeah.
Oh,

1086
00:47:53,610 --> 00:47:56,250
okay.
Oh this is crazy.

1087
00:47:58,870 --> 00:47:59,630
Okay.

1088
00:47:59,630 --> 00:48:00,980
Everyone's just listening to the same 
thing.

1089
00:48:00,981 --> 00:48:02,990
There's just no out like no one outside 
can hear you.

1090
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:06,800
Well that's good to your neighbors.
That's awesome.

1091
00:48:06,801 --> 00:48:08,330
In that way it's great for your 
neighbors.

1092
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:09,193
Yeah.
You don't have to be rude because it's 

1093
00:48:10,461 --> 00:48:15,461
like that one asshole on your block who 
has a party but his music tastes sox.

1094
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:17,293
There was this part of that they had 
near my neighborhood about 10 years ago 

1095
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:25,240
and it was the most fucking depressing,
like trapped in the,

1096
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:26,513
it was like,
Oh let me try to remember what kind of 

1097
00:48:28,311 --> 00:48:30,200
music there.
But it was like the captain and to kneel

1098
00:48:30,201 --> 00:48:32,270
or some shit.
It was so bad.

1099
00:48:32,510 --> 00:48:34,550
It was just like,
like how would they cranking this?

1100
00:48:34,551 --> 00:48:35,384
Like what the fuck are they doing?
You want to show up at their house with 

1101
00:48:37,401 --> 00:48:40,250
like some wine?
That's a bad example.

1102
00:48:40,370 --> 00:48:42,320
I can't remember what it was cause I 
blocked it out.

1103
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:46,400
Like childhood molestation.
It was so bad.

1104
00:48:46,401 --> 00:48:48,230
They were,
they were playing this fucking terrible,

1105
00:48:48,231 --> 00:48:51,200
but it was like this asshole was playing
it loud like he,

1106
00:48:51,230 --> 00:48:53,570
it wasn't,
you couldn't even enjoy,

1107
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:56,360
it was so loud.
There's no way he was enjoying it.

1108
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:57,313
He was enjoying showing off that he was 
having a party with this shitty music 

1109
00:49:00,601 --> 00:49:02,750
that him and his dying friends were 
playing.

1110
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:04,273
What do you listen to?
I listened to a lot of classic rock a 

1111
00:49:07,251 --> 00:49:08,084
lot.
Like as I get older it just seems like 

1112
00:49:09,381 --> 00:49:11,990
I'm becoming that old dude that listens 
to classic rock.

1113
00:49:12,050 --> 00:49:14,310
Like I listen to a lot of Leonard 
Skinner,

1114
00:49:14,410 --> 00:49:17,270
a lot of Hendrix.
I've been listening to a lot of,

1115
00:49:17,271 --> 00:49:19,850
um,
boy,

1116
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:24,650
just almost anything from the 60s and 
the early seventies is what a lot of,

1117
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:26,970
a lot of what I listened to.
Listen,

1118
00:49:26,990 --> 00:49:29,280
a lot of credence lately.
Craziness.

1119
00:49:29,450 --> 00:49:30,150
Yeah,

1120
00:49:30,150 --> 00:49:31,490
that's good.
I uh,

1121
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:34,560
fuck with his voice used to kind of mess
me up,

1122
00:49:34,561 --> 00:49:39,561
but I've come to like,
except appreciate the tone and like the,

1123
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:43,740
you know,
comes from a heartfelt place.

1124
00:49:43,830 --> 00:49:45,660
When I was younger I couldn't,
what's he saying?

1125
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:47,273
Yeah,

1126
00:49:47,340 --> 00:49:48,173
you got to,
there's certain music that you got to 

1127
00:49:49,081 --> 00:49:51,690
revisit as you hit different stages in 
life.

1128
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:52,553
I think there's certain music that I 
wasn't into and then I'll go back now 

1129
00:49:56,141 --> 00:49:58,320
and now I can get into it.
Credence is one of those.

1130
00:49:58,380 --> 00:50:00,750
Yeah.
Like my friends in high school or in the

1131
00:50:00,751 --> 00:50:02,040
credence and no one was

1132
00:50:03,510 --> 00:50:07,160
yeah.
In high school people were listening to.

1133
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:09,600
Hm.

1134
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:11,430
Uh,
the Houston like Swisher House,

1135
00:50:11,431 --> 00:50:13,840
Paul Wall.
Um,

1136
00:50:14,140 --> 00:50:15,190
that's all it.
Cough Syrup.

1137
00:50:15,191 --> 00:50:15,880
Music,
right?

1138
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:16,713
Yeah.
Yeah.

1139
00:50:19,060 --> 00:50:19,893
It's like,
so it was a dat ugk outcast lot of Dave 

1140
00:50:28,610 --> 00:50:29,360
Matthews.

1141
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:29,910
Okay.

1142
00:50:29,910 --> 00:50:32,250
A lot.
Dave Matthews I went to,

1143
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:34,590
I went to like this,
I went to the school board.

1144
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:36,390
Dangerous shut this podcast off.
Right.

1145
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:39,810
That's it.
That's done there.

1146
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:41,780
But it was different.
Cory,

1147
00:50:41,870 --> 00:50:42,703
moral Robert or

1148
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:44,760
gain like a lot of it was different.
Like,

1149
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:46,933
um,
and some of it I've come to appreciate 

1150
00:50:50,131 --> 00:50:52,680
and some of it I've just kinda left 
behind.

1151
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,720
I like outcast,
outcast.

1152
00:50:54,721 --> 00:50:57,090
They do a lot of experimental shit.
Yeah,

1153
00:50:57,120 --> 00:50:58,600
they're great.
They do a lot of interest.

1154
00:50:58,601 --> 00:51:02,220
It didn't,
didn't want to do from outkast.

1155
00:51:02,250 --> 00:51:04,560
Was any supposed to play Jimmy Hendrix?
He did.

1156
00:51:04,830 --> 00:51:05,760
Yeah,
he did that movie.

1157
00:51:06,810 --> 00:51:08,450
I never heard of it.
No,

1158
00:51:08,950 --> 00:51:11,130
never,
never heard a thing about it.

1159
00:51:11,810 --> 00:51:13,230
They just came and went.
Did you see it?

1160
00:51:13,231 --> 00:51:14,130
Yeah,
I saw it out here.

1161
00:51:14,190 --> 00:51:15,440
How was it?
Uh,

1162
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:18,480
it was good as far as the story.
I mean it was,

1163
00:51:19,050 --> 00:51:21,780
I felt like I,
uh,

1164
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:24,750
Andre Played Hendrix.
Great.

1165
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:26,333
Uh,

1166
00:51:27,110 --> 00:51:27,943
there was a lot of the stuff that I 
didn't know that where they had to do 

1167
00:51:30,841 --> 00:51:33,050
different music cause they couldn't use 
the Hendrix music.

1168
00:51:33,230 --> 00:51:34,063
So that,
that for me was kind of fucked me up a 

1169
00:51:37,621 --> 00:51:40,440
little bit,
a little bit because it was,

1170
00:51:40,940 --> 00:51:45,360
it was recreated and then being a guitar
player

1171
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:52,080
was it quiet?
Like it really Kinda mess me up.

1172
00:51:52,841 --> 00:51:54,280
But I mean the story was,

1173
00:51:54,550 --> 00:51:55,383
was great and I think Andre did a great 
job in the casita great job considering 

1174
00:51:58,961 --> 00:52:00,540
what they,
you know,

1175
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:02,770
we're working with,
but there was no Hendrickson music.

1176
00:52:04,060 --> 00:52:06,550
How could they should scrap the project 
or paid up,

1177
00:52:06,551 --> 00:52:09,460
paid the family.
You got to pay the family if you want to

1178
00:52:09,461 --> 00:52:10,294
make a fucking documentary or a bio pic.
About arguably the greatest guitarist 

1179
00:52:14,381 --> 00:52:17,190
that's ever lived.
You gotta use this fucking music and got

1180
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:19,090
to give his parents the money or 
whoever,

1181
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:19,993
whoever's alive,
give him the money and if you gotta pay 

1182
00:52:21,371 --> 00:52:22,204
him,
that's the only way you're going to do 

1183
00:52:22,931 --> 00:52:23,381
it.
Right.

1184
00:52:23,381 --> 00:52:24,214
Otherwise you're going to get a movie 
like that where we don't talk about it 

1185
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:28,190
just goes in and out.
Yeah.

1186
00:52:28,570 --> 00:52:29,403
The guitar thing must drive you crazy 
though when you know he's not really 

1187
00:52:31,391 --> 00:52:33,130
playing that I couldn't handle it

1188
00:52:35,690 --> 00:52:39,080
cause me on a much lesser scale.
I'm not a professional pool player,

1189
00:52:39,380 --> 00:52:42,620
but when I watched someone in a movie 
and I know they can't really play pool,

1190
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:45,740
it's very obvious.
You see the way a guy's holding a stick,

1191
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:48,380
the way the stick moves in their arm.
It's like,

1192
00:52:48,530 --> 00:52:49,363
have you ever seen someone hold a 
cigarette that doesn't really smoke and 

1193
00:52:51,261 --> 00:52:52,094
you could tell like a smoker can tell 
like almost immediately when someone 

1194
00:52:55,071 --> 00:52:55,904
doesn't actually smoke or at least 
someone who is not aware of how people 

1195
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:01,343
smoke smoke.
I'm sure an actor can figure out how to 

1196
00:53:03,381 --> 00:53:04,214
smoke like a smoker,
a lot easier than someone could figure 

1197
00:53:06,441 --> 00:53:09,440
out how to play guitar and Mimic it.
Right.

1198
00:53:09,590 --> 00:53:11,870
Because when I see someone who can't 
play pool and a movie and you're like,

1199
00:53:12,410 --> 00:53:13,243
you know,
pool hall junkies or something like 

1200
00:53:14,241 --> 00:53:15,074
that,
my shit get that fucking thing off to 

1201
00:53:15,771 --> 00:53:17,120
tell.
It just drives me crazy.

1202
00:53:17,260 --> 00:53:19,160
I that guy can't play,
he can't play.

1203
00:53:19,190 --> 00:53:20,540
There's no,
he's doing it all wrong.

1204
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:21,471
I know.
He's really good.

1205
00:53:21,471 --> 00:53:22,910
His bridge,
look at the way he's holding it.

1206
00:53:22,911 --> 00:53:25,040
This is bullshit.
And that's something real similar.

1207
00:53:25,230 --> 00:53:26,130
I mean he real simple

1208
00:53:26,130 --> 00:53:26,963
rather,
it's just uh,

1209
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:29,820
the movement of an arm.
And I could tell,

1210
00:53:29,821 --> 00:53:34,320
but for fingers and keys and the way a 
guy's sounding,

1211
00:53:34,350 --> 00:53:36,360
I mean,
they must be bananas to you.

1212
00:53:37,430 --> 00:53:39,030
Yeah,
I uh,

1213
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:40,350
yeah,
it drove me nuts.

1214
00:53:40,860 --> 00:53:42,330
I mean,
I don't know what to say.

1215
00:53:42,331 --> 00:53:43,350
I was like,
fuck,

1216
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:45,510
somebody picks it.
But yeah.

1217
00:53:45,511 --> 00:53:48,060
What the fuck man?
How do they not have like a coordinator?

1218
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:49,890
I Dunno.
I Dunno.

1219
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:52,080
I Dunno.
But you know,

1220
00:53:52,260 --> 00:53:55,470
unless your bullshit and unless it's 
like a crazy Kung fu movie,

1221
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:56,333
like obviously I have a connection to 
martial arts where if I know someone's 

1222
00:53:59,011 --> 00:54:00,420
doing something that's not really gonna 
work,

1223
00:54:00,450 --> 00:54:02,760
it'll drive me crazy.
But if he's like,

1224
00:54:02,761 --> 00:54:05,100
wow,
like fucking pulling people's hearts out

1225
00:54:05,101 --> 00:54:07,740
and flying through the air and throwing 
side kicks through buildings,

1226
00:54:08,630 --> 00:54:12,090
I'm willing to suspend disbelief,
you know?

1227
00:54:12,630 --> 00:54:16,000
But you can't do that for Jimi Hendrix 
in a fucking biopic.

1228
00:54:16,010 --> 00:54:17,130
Yeah,
that's true.

1229
00:54:17,170 --> 00:54:18,003
I've got a question for you.
One of my favorite shows growing up was 

1230
00:54:23,070 --> 00:54:24,730
Kung Fu with David carradine.
Yeah.

1231
00:54:25,390 --> 00:54:26,460
How did you feel about it?
Oh,

1232
00:54:26,461 --> 00:54:27,780
bullshit.
Yeah.

1233
00:54:27,810 --> 00:54:29,360
Yeah.
I loved it.

1234
00:54:29,390 --> 00:54:30,630
It when I was a kid though.
Right.

1235
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:32,370
But you watch it now and you're like,
what?

1236
00:54:33,330 --> 00:54:35,310
But it was basically fighting.
People didn't know how to fight.

1237
00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:38,860
Think there was no one he fought.
Like some dude came out and was a legit,

1238
00:54:38,861 --> 00:54:40,770
and Moy Thai fighters started kicking 
his legs.

1239
00:54:40,870 --> 00:54:44,040
Right.
The carotene wrote out and killed him.

1240
00:54:44,270 --> 00:54:46,020
It was awesome.
Drunk guy with the beer mug.

1241
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:47,790
Yeah,
exactly.

1242
00:54:48,390 --> 00:54:50,970
I don't think he really learned Kung Fu 
for that show.

1243
00:54:51,060 --> 00:54:53,370
I don't know,
but it didn't seem like he did.

1244
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:54,713
It seemed like he had very little,
that seemed like a real martial arts 

1245
00:54:58,561 --> 00:55:00,450
move.
Yeah.

1246
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:02,450
I don't,
I,

1247
00:55:02,630 --> 00:55:04,730
I recently went back a couple of years 
ago,

1248
00:55:05,250 --> 00:55:07,790
bought the series and watched the whole 
thing cause as a kid I loved it.

1249
00:55:07,791 --> 00:55:08,624
It was,
yeah,

1250
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:11,910
my dad,
we'll put it on here you go son,

1251
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:12,930
learn something,
you know,

1252
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:15,510
lessons about how not to be an asshole.
Yeah.

1253
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:18,840
And uh,
so yeah,

1254
00:55:18,841 --> 00:55:20,400
but I watched it recently and I was 
wearing,

1255
00:55:20,401 --> 00:55:21,570
I was like,
what are these guys?

1256
00:55:21,790 --> 00:55:22,650
So,
you know,

1257
00:55:22,740 --> 00:55:25,110
cause he was like,
really know what's up.

1258
00:55:25,111 --> 00:55:26,700
How do you feel about this?
Because I don't know.

1259
00:55:26,790 --> 00:55:28,140
You know what I mean?
Right.

1260
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:32,210
So yeah,
no one respects it.

1261
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:34,153
Okay.

1262
00:55:36,630 --> 00:55:39,780
But it was a good show in terms of 
interesting,

1263
00:55:40,050 --> 00:55:42,030
like if you take out the martial arts 
element of it,

1264
00:55:42,060 --> 00:55:46,360
it's an interesting show.
You got this guy who was raised in a,

1265
00:55:46,650 --> 00:55:50,610
like a monastery and then he's wandering
to the old west.

1266
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:51,533
It's kind of a cool premise.
The premise behind it is really 

1267
00:55:53,551 --> 00:55:54,750
interesting,
you know?

1268
00:55:54,751 --> 00:55:55,584
And he was like this real calm,
peaceful guy who wasn't an asshole at 

1269
00:56:00,001 --> 00:56:01,860
all.
I could not have been nicer.

1270
00:56:02,310 --> 00:56:03,143
And that was a unique character because 
there's really never been anybody on 

1271
00:56:05,371 --> 00:56:06,570
television.
It was like that.

1272
00:56:06,571 --> 00:56:09,300
Just like there's an enlightened,
peaceful guy,

1273
00:56:09,620 --> 00:56:11,190
you know,
he had long hair and shit.

1274
00:56:11,230 --> 00:56:12,063
He's just kind of a hippie and it's 
wandering through life and people keep 

1275
00:56:13,891 --> 00:56:15,570
fucking with them.
Keep fucking with them.

1276
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:16,800
All right.
You know,

1277
00:56:17,310 --> 00:56:18,143
it was interesting in that way.
Like it made a lot of people want to 

1278
00:56:21,511 --> 00:56:23,610
pretend they're that guy.
I'm sure.

1279
00:56:25,030 --> 00:56:28,110
Definitely.
Yeah.

1280
00:56:28,570 --> 00:56:30,970
Like house out.
How so?

1281
00:56:31,060 --> 00:56:31,900
Yeah.
How are you one of them?

1282
00:56:32,630 --> 00:56:33,463
I mean,
uh,

1283
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:36,050
just,
just the attitude,

1284
00:56:36,051 --> 00:56:38,000
just the,
you know,

1285
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:40,070
uh,
I would,

1286
00:56:40,340 --> 00:56:42,500
I was waiting for a moment,
you know,

1287
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:44,690
I wish somebody would so I could quite 
Chang Caine.

1288
00:56:46,850 --> 00:56:49,880
That's the opposite though.
He wished somebody would be peaceful.

1289
00:56:52,450 --> 00:56:54,310
I mean,
I was a kid so I can all right.

1290
00:56:54,340 --> 00:56:54,650
You know,

1291
00:56:54,650 --> 00:56:55,730
of course.
I love that.

1292
00:56:56,430 --> 00:56:58,680
Speaking of being an inspired man,
you know,

1293
00:56:58,910 --> 00:57:00,740
one of my favorite things that I love to
do,

1294
00:57:00,741 --> 00:57:02,200
which I haven't done in awhile.
It was,

1295
00:57:02,510 --> 00:57:04,010
it was um,
you know,

1296
00:57:04,670 --> 00:57:08,120
catch up and watch the UFC,
you know,

1297
00:57:08,180 --> 00:57:10,030
and get into that.
And um,

1298
00:57:10,370 --> 00:57:14,570
I was sitting around and starting to 
kind of feel like a piece of shit,

1299
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:17,480
drinking too much and whatever.
And so it was,

1300
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:18,650
you know,
looking at these guys,

1301
00:57:19,130 --> 00:57:21,290
you know,
training and doing what they do.

1302
00:57:21,291 --> 00:57:22,124
So I kinda inspired me to get on my bike
and he'd get the heavy bag and get on 

1303
00:57:25,311 --> 00:57:28,630
the weights and do my thing.
And uh,

1304
00:57:28,830 --> 00:57:29,663
it was really into it.
I haven't been been keeping up for 

1305
00:57:32,601 --> 00:57:36,090
awhile and kind of got the guts to show 
it and I'm working on them.

1306
00:57:36,140 --> 00:57:38,180
I need to get back on my game is what 
I'm saying.

1307
00:57:38,770 --> 00:57:40,180
Do you want to train while you were in 
la?

1308
00:57:40,210 --> 00:57:42,510
Is that what you're saying?
I would love to find you need to,

1309
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:45,110
I need to do.
So we'll talk off the air and uh,

1310
00:57:45,111 --> 00:57:45,944
I'll,
I'll get you to know like are you 

1311
00:57:46,511 --> 00:57:49,030
interested in taking Jujitsu or what are
you interested in doing?

1312
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:52,060
Well,
whatever it was was kind of right for,

1313
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:53,093
for me and my build and,
well I don't have a whole lot of time 

1314
00:57:56,321 --> 00:57:57,154
but I'm definitely interested in and 
getting back into it and get my mind 

1315
00:57:59,531 --> 00:58:00,110
focused.

1316
00:58:00,110 --> 00:58:00,943
The real reality is there's different 
styles of Jujitsu that are great for 

1317
00:58:03,861 --> 00:58:06,230
every build.
And when I say different styles,

1318
00:58:06,231 --> 00:58:09,890
I mean different approaches to Jujitsu 
is so broad.

1319
00:58:10,100 --> 00:58:12,830
There's so many different techniques and
there's so many different strategies and

1320
00:58:12,831 --> 00:58:17,570
so many different moves and countermoves
that your build is perfect for Jujitsu.

1321
00:58:17,870 --> 00:58:20,690
You along and tall,
you have long arms and long legs and you

1322
00:58:20,691 --> 00:58:21,524
can catch people in chokes that a stubby
little dude like me can't cause I have 

1323
00:58:25,041 --> 00:58:26,570
short arms,
short legs,

1324
00:58:26,690 --> 00:58:27,950
you know,
it's different,

1325
00:58:27,951 --> 00:58:32,170
but different builds like mine are 
better for certain positions like this,

1326
00:58:32,171 --> 00:58:35,900
this guy who some are Paul Harris who's,
he's like me but more exaggerated.

1327
00:58:35,901 --> 00:58:39,080
He's way thicker and more muscular and 
he just tears people's legs apart.

1328
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:40,333
He's a leg lock specialist and there's a
lot of other guys that are smaller that 

1329
00:58:43,700 --> 00:58:44,533
is like really fast and they're good at 
taking people's backs like Marcella 

1330
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:47,900
Garcia.

1331
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:51,310
But um,
there's a lot of tall guys and Jujitsu.

1332
00:58:51,380 --> 00:58:53,150
It's,
there's definitely an advantage.

1333
00:58:53,510 --> 00:58:54,343
It's an advantage of leverage.
I'm like just mechanical leverage from 

1334
00:58:56,691 --> 00:58:59,810
having long limbs.
It's good for striking to them,

1335
00:58:59,811 --> 00:59:01,310
man.
It's good for learning,

1336
00:59:01,311 --> 00:59:03,080
not striking arts.
Like if I,

1337
00:59:03,081 --> 00:59:03,914
if I had to say like,
if there's one bill that has like the 

1338
00:59:06,051 --> 00:59:06,884
most definitive advantages,
I would say tall and long because it's 

1339
00:59:09,561 --> 00:59:11,570
harder to hit you because you're further
away from me.

1340
00:59:11,740 --> 00:59:12,573
Uh,
you get hit me in a place where I can 

1341
00:59:13,401 --> 00:59:14,720
hit you.
Like how tall are you?

1342
00:59:14,900 --> 00:59:15,690
Six,
four,

1343
00:59:15,690 --> 00:59:16,161
six,
four.

1344
00:59:16,161 --> 00:59:16,994
I'm five.
Eight.

1345
00:59:17,210 --> 00:59:20,630
So you're dealing with all that.
You're dealing with eight extra inches.

1346
00:59:20,750 --> 00:59:23,550
So eight extra inches between,
uh,

1347
00:59:23,551 --> 00:59:27,290
your head in my head,
which may or may not translate as far as

1348
00:59:27,291 --> 00:59:27,890
like,
uh,

1349
00:59:27,890 --> 00:59:30,470
how long your arms are,
how long your legs are.

1350
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:34,520
But definitely there's a at least a few 
inches of advantage,

1351
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:37,820
which means like if we're both throwing 
punches at the same time,

1352
00:59:37,821 --> 00:59:38,654
you had hit me before I would hit you 
and I probably would never hit you 

1353
00:59:40,671 --> 00:59:41,504
because of that because he would hit me 
like as I was throwing up punch and I'd 

1354
00:59:43,980 --> 00:59:46,730
get fucked up like that.
That's a big advantage.

1355
00:59:46,731 --> 00:59:48,320
Like John Jones,
the UFC,

1356
00:59:48,340 --> 00:59:49,173
a former light heavyweight champion.
He's like the best at you cause he's a 

1357
00:59:51,321 --> 00:59:54,470
big tall dude and he's the best at like 
using that advantage.

1358
00:59:54,560 --> 00:59:56,690
It's one of the best advantages of being
long and tall.

1359
00:59:56,930 --> 00:59:58,110
Right?
Yeah.

1360
00:59:58,130 --> 00:59:59,330
I'm ready.
You Ready?

1361
00:59:59,360 --> 01:00:01,570
I need to do checking,
moving your jacket.

1362
01:00:02,300 --> 01:00:04,760
I was like balling up my fists way.
You're talking to like,

1363
01:00:04,770 --> 01:00:05,603
yes,
do this.

1364
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:08,750
Well that's a great way to blow off 
energy and stress.

1365
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:12,080
I need that as well.
Definitely people get addicted to it.

1366
01:00:12,080 --> 01:00:12,913
Like we was talking about bordain um,
he didn't even start doing it until he 

1367
01:00:14,991 --> 01:00:19,100
was 58 and 57 58 and now he does it 
every day.

1368
01:00:19,130 --> 01:00:21,200
He does Jiu Jitsu every day.
He loves it.

1369
01:00:21,201 --> 01:00:22,460
He's obsessed with it.
Yeah.

1370
01:00:22,910 --> 01:00:25,000
A lot of musicians get into it.
Um,

1371
01:00:25,050 --> 01:00:27,690
I know a lot of musicians that are in a 
Jiu Jitsu,

1372
01:00:28,010 --> 01:00:28,843
they,
because it becomes like a martial arts 

1373
01:00:30,741 --> 01:00:31,574
really are an art form.
It doesn't seem an art form to the 

1374
01:00:33,861 --> 01:00:35,540
outsider because people,
they say,

1375
01:00:35,570 --> 01:00:36,560
oh,
it's just fighting.

1376
01:00:36,561 --> 01:00:40,070
It's just brutality.
But the reality is there's way,

1377
01:00:40,071 --> 01:00:40,904
way,
way more people who are into martial 

1378
01:00:42,141 --> 01:00:44,600
arts who never get into a fight ever 
then,

1379
01:00:44,630 --> 01:00:48,470
then people who use it either in 
competition or use it for self defense.

1380
01:00:48,860 --> 01:00:50,180
It's uh,
it's,

1381
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:53,390
it's a form of art.
It's an expression.

1382
01:00:53,391 --> 01:00:55,490
And you,
when you watch someone pull off a move,

1383
01:00:55,790 --> 01:00:56,660
it's beautiful.

1384
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:57,553
It's just,
it's one of those things that seems to 

1385
01:00:58,491 --> 01:01:00,740
be only beautiful for people who 
understand it,

1386
01:01:01,100 --> 01:01:02,900
but for people to understand that it's 
amazing.

1387
01:01:03,020 --> 01:01:03,760
Yeah.
No,

1388
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:04,850
I mean,
I can respect it.

1389
01:01:04,851 --> 01:01:07,280
I,
I kind of understand what's going on.

1390
01:01:07,281 --> 01:01:08,360
I can appreciate it.
Like,

1391
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:12,350
you know,
someone playing a nice solo or something

1392
01:01:12,351 --> 01:01:16,100
and executing it well yeah,
I can kind of get that,

1393
01:01:16,130 --> 01:01:16,963
you know,
the,

1394
01:01:17,330 --> 01:01:18,163
the art,
the what it takes to pay attention to 

1395
01:01:20,770 --> 01:01:23,480
and be in that moment and,
and you know,

1396
01:01:24,260 --> 01:01:25,520
uh,
execute.

1397
01:01:25,970 --> 01:01:27,230
It's a bunch.
It's that,

1398
01:01:27,260 --> 01:01:28,093
it's a bunch of other factors too.
It's setting up an attack that either 

1399
01:01:32,151 --> 01:01:32,984
the person couldn't anticipate or 
couldn't figure out what to do in time 

1400
01:01:36,620 --> 01:01:39,500
and then it locks in and then once it 
locks in and be like,

1401
01:01:39,530 --> 01:01:41,150
Oh shit,
it's beautiful.

1402
01:01:41,151 --> 01:01:43,850
It's like,
it's like a painting or a work of art or

1403
01:01:43,910 --> 01:01:46,940
masterful guitar solo or any of those 
things.

1404
01:01:47,350 --> 01:01:48,183
Art Is your,
your dedication and your focus and then 

1405
01:01:51,621 --> 01:01:56,180
the expression and the results of that 
dedication and focus in a way where like

1406
01:01:56,181 --> 01:01:58,580
if I'll watch someone pull off a move 
that I don't know how to do,

1407
01:01:58,581 --> 01:02:01,190
it's particularly beautiful to me 
because I'm like,

1408
01:02:01,220 --> 01:02:02,053
Oh shit,
look what he did that like there's 

1409
01:02:03,561 --> 01:02:07,070
certain moves that I'll have to replay 
like over and over and over again.

1410
01:02:07,071 --> 01:02:07,904
Like,
I'll watch certain setups like over and 

1411
01:02:10,401 --> 01:02:12,430
over and over again until I get it into 
my head and,

1412
01:02:12,740 --> 01:02:13,573
and I didn't this so many different ways
to move the body that there's a lot of 

1413
01:02:17,601 --> 01:02:20,010
like I've been doing Jujitsu since 1996

1414
01:02:20,250 --> 01:02:22,800
and there's still a bunch of moves that 
I don't know,

1415
01:02:23,190 --> 01:02:24,840
I don't understand and I have to go,
oh,

1416
01:02:24,841 --> 01:02:26,130
how did he do that?
How did he do that?

1417
01:02:26,310 --> 01:02:27,143
But today,
like we're talking about like with 

1418
01:02:28,591 --> 01:02:29,424
Google,
we're so lucky that we could just go to 

1419
01:02:31,741 --> 01:02:32,574
youtube videos.
And one of the beautiful things about 

1420
01:02:35,101 --> 01:02:38,850
Jujitsu is it used to be that martial 
arts where like a secret,

1421
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:39,833
this is the secret death touch.
And nobody would tell you that secret 

1422
01:02:42,361 --> 01:02:43,200
death touch,
right?

1423
01:02:43,201 --> 01:02:44,790
It didn't exist.
It was bullshit.

1424
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:46,193
The reality of Jujitsu is almost every 
move people are dying to explain to 

1425
01:02:51,031 --> 01:02:53,070
people because people love learning new 
shit.

1426
01:02:53,430 --> 01:02:56,070
People that are Jujitsu artists love 
learning new stuff.

1427
01:02:56,220 --> 01:02:58,500
So people that are Jujutsu artists that 
have a new move,

1428
01:02:58,501 --> 01:03:01,860
love to put that move online.
It's a big part of the community.

1429
01:03:02,040 --> 01:03:04,410
A huge part of the community is sharing 
and openness.

1430
01:03:05,010 --> 01:03:08,010
So like everybody does seminars and 
everybody teaches everybody everything.

1431
01:03:08,310 --> 01:03:10,650
But in the early days it wasn't like 
that.

1432
01:03:10,651 --> 01:03:11,484
Even the early days of Jujitsu when what
happened was in 1993 when the UFC was 

1433
01:03:16,171 --> 01:03:17,004
created,
people first started to see Jujitsu and 

1434
01:03:18,691 --> 01:03:19,980
they were like,
what the fuck?

1435
01:03:19,981 --> 01:03:20,814
But there was a lot of moves like 
triangles or things like along those 

1436
01:03:22,831 --> 01:03:27,270
lines where I had friends that would 
take classes at certain schools and they

1437
01:03:27,271 --> 01:03:27,991
would say,
hey,

1438
01:03:27,991 --> 01:03:28,824
you know,
hoists gracie tapped out Dan Saffron 

1439
01:03:30,301 --> 01:03:31,710
with a triangle,
how do I do that?

1440
01:03:31,950 --> 01:03:33,570
And the teacher like,
you're not ready for that yet.

1441
01:03:34,180 --> 01:03:36,170
Like I can't teach you that yet,
but that's,

1442
01:03:36,220 --> 01:03:39,030
that's a black belt technique or that's 
a purple belt technique or whatever.

1443
01:03:39,060 --> 01:03:41,040
And they just,
and people are turned off to it.

1444
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:42,113
And then they found other more 
unconventional openminded schools that 

1445
01:03:45,750 --> 01:03:46,583
immediately taught everybody everything.
And those are the schools that became 

1446
01:03:49,171 --> 01:03:50,004
prosperous.

1447
01:03:50,110 --> 01:03:53,790
Those schools were really successful.
And the schools that held people back,

1448
01:03:53,820 --> 01:03:54,653
they never produce champions,
they never produced any like real 

1449
01:03:56,791 --> 01:03:57,624
notable Jujitsu players.
And the open minded like experimental 

1450
01:04:00,841 --> 01:04:02,850
schools,
those are the ones that blew up.

1451
01:04:03,120 --> 01:04:03,953
It's really interesting in that way,
like the free exchange of information 

1452
01:04:07,410 --> 01:04:10,470
overwhelmingly won out in the world of 
Jujitsu.

1453
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:13,200
That makes sense to me.
It does,

1454
01:04:13,201 --> 01:04:14,034
right?
Yeah.

1455
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:15,870
So how does it like,
um,

1456
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:18,833
like I,
I have a same kind of appreciation for 

1457
01:04:22,650 --> 01:04:24,660
like,
like the art,

1458
01:04:24,661 --> 01:04:26,190
martial arts,
comedy,

1459
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:28,140
music,
um,

1460
01:04:29,130 --> 01:04:30,060
you know,
anything like that.

1461
01:04:30,061 --> 01:04:30,894
Like,
I can appreciate the hard work and 

1462
01:04:32,101 --> 01:04:32,934
everything that goes back into,
so you feel the same way about martial 

1463
01:04:34,951 --> 01:04:38,520
arts is like comedy or do you approach 
it the same way or?

1464
01:04:38,910 --> 01:04:40,410
Well,
um,

1465
01:04:40,630 --> 01:04:42,090
in some ways,
yeah,

1466
01:04:42,120 --> 01:04:44,640
in some ways it's,
it's about practice,

1467
01:04:44,670 --> 01:04:47,430
dedication,
application and reality.

1468
01:04:47,580 --> 01:04:50,070
Like if something's not funny,
it's just not funny.

1469
01:04:50,070 --> 01:04:51,660
If people don't laugh,
they just don't laugh.

1470
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:54,240
And if a technique doesn't work,
it just doesn't work.

1471
01:04:54,510 --> 01:04:55,680
You know,
if you can't pull it off,

1472
01:04:55,681 --> 01:04:57,440
if somebody chokes you,
they just choked you.

1473
01:04:57,950 --> 01:05:01,260
You know,
you could be a 20 year black belt,

1474
01:05:01,261 --> 01:05:02,094
right.
And some dude catches you in a 

1475
01:05:03,101 --> 01:05:03,934
guillotine.
He's only been doing Jujitsu for six 

1476
01:05:04,831 --> 01:05:07,650
months,
but someone teaches him how to do this.

1477
01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:09,260
Grab your arm like that.
Polar,

1478
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:12,060
any someone's neck,
wrap your legs around him at squeeze and

1479
01:05:12,061 --> 01:05:13,080
you can't get out.
Well,

1480
01:05:13,081 --> 01:05:15,870
he tapped you.
Even if he's only been doing Jujitsu for

1481
01:05:15,871 --> 01:05:18,760
six months and you've been doing Jujitsu
for 30 years,

1482
01:05:19,150 --> 01:05:22,060
it's stays.
It's still real for guy taps you,

1483
01:05:22,061 --> 01:05:23,980
they tap you just,
there's no,

1484
01:05:24,010 --> 01:05:24,843
if it's like,
it's one of the things I love about 

1485
01:05:25,721 --> 01:05:26,554
pool.
The ball either goes in the hole or it 

1486
01:05:28,061 --> 01:05:28,930
doesn't go in the hole.

1487
01:05:29,620 --> 01:05:31,900
It doesn't matter if either knock it in 
the hole or you don't.

1488
01:05:31,901 --> 01:05:34,990
There's no almost made that shot.
That doesn't mean Jack Shit,

1489
01:05:35,500 --> 01:05:37,030
you know,
it doesn't mean anything.

1490
01:05:37,660 --> 01:05:40,260
I'm that asshole who says that.
Well,

1491
01:05:40,270 --> 01:05:41,103
we all say it,
but you know the reality of the actual 

1492
01:05:43,451 --> 01:05:44,780
winning of the game,
right?

1493
01:05:45,390 --> 01:05:47,140
It's a personality thing.
Like,

1494
01:05:47,141 --> 01:05:47,974
sometimes people can get really far on a
bullshit personality and a lot of 

1495
01:05:51,281 --> 01:05:55,440
bravado and a lot of bragging and a lot 
of false stories and,

1496
01:05:55,441 --> 01:05:58,870
and,
and then the actual application life is,

1497
01:05:58,871 --> 01:06:02,650
they've sort of skirted through with all
the dance moves and all the personality,

1498
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:04,360
but they don't have any real substance 
to it.

1499
01:06:04,630 --> 01:06:06,610
That doesn't work in Jujitsu.
Just like,

1500
01:06:06,611 --> 01:06:08,980
it doesn't really work in comedy,
comedy,

1501
01:06:08,981 --> 01:06:12,820
like personality accounts for certain 
amount of the audience accepting you.

1502
01:06:12,821 --> 01:06:13,654
But ultimately if the concepts aren't 
there and if you don't have like a good 

1503
01:06:18,011 --> 01:06:19,810
setup,
if you don't know how to deliver it in a

1504
01:06:19,811 --> 01:06:20,644
way that people are gonna,
like it's going to easily enter into 

1505
01:06:23,201 --> 01:06:25,390
their mind and they're going to like 
carry along,

1506
01:06:25,420 --> 01:06:28,660
then it either works or it doesn't.
And there's,

1507
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:29,553
there's,
there's some parallel truths in that in 

1508
01:06:32,231 --> 01:06:34,420
martial arts and in comedy in that way.

1509
01:06:36,690 --> 01:06:37,960
Yeah.
Um,

1510
01:06:39,040 --> 01:06:39,490
yeah,
I'm,

1511
01:06:39,490 --> 01:06:41,110
I'm,
I'm very intrigued by all of it,

1512
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:46,200
so that's why I'm asking some very 
curious.

1513
01:06:47,231 --> 01:06:49,030
I want to get in there.
Well,

1514
01:06:49,031 --> 01:06:52,960
all complex systems,
whether it's music or writing,

1515
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:54,033
I'm creating a movie.
Anything complex things are fascinating 

1516
01:06:56,381 --> 01:06:59,830
to me too cause I just like,
I've never made a movie,

1517
01:07:00,070 --> 01:07:03,280
but I want to see like CGI animators.
I go watch this.

1518
01:07:03,281 --> 01:07:04,870
Uh,
this um,

1519
01:07:04,900 --> 01:07:05,733
documentary on a guy's making a animated
scenes for films like special effects 

1520
01:07:10,811 --> 01:07:12,730
scenes.
And I think to myself,

1521
01:07:12,731 --> 01:07:13,564
wow,
that is fascinating that they're 

1522
01:07:13,841 --> 01:07:17,050
creating an artificial world and inside 
that artificial world,

1523
01:07:17,051 --> 01:07:17,884
they have these creatures moving and 
they have these people they'd have to 

1524
01:07:19,781 --> 01:07:22,810
put on these motion capture suits and go
through the motions,

1525
01:07:22,811 --> 01:07:25,630
pretending they're interacting with 
these things that aren't even there.

1526
01:07:25,810 --> 01:07:27,940
And then someone has to peace.
It's amazing to me.

1527
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,580
It's amazing to me,
but I'm not going to do it.

1528
01:07:30,910 --> 01:07:31,840
I don't have any time.

1529
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:34,833
But I look at that the same way I kind 
of look at music or the same way I look 

1530
01:07:37,931 --> 01:07:38,764
at writing or comedy or anything.
So it's fascinating to me watching 

1531
01:07:42,161 --> 01:07:42,994
someone go after something and put it 
together and make something that is 

1532
01:07:47,651 --> 01:07:51,580
almost unfathomable take place.
Whether it's a creation of an album,

1533
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:52,900
whether it's a,
you know,

1534
01:07:52,901 --> 01:07:53,734
a comedy special,
whether it's someone writes an amazing 

1535
01:07:55,871 --> 01:07:58,630
book.
I love when people get shit done.

1536
01:08:00,070 --> 01:08:01,630
Yeah,
I do too.

1537
01:08:02,440 --> 01:08:03,880
It's a beautiful thing.
Yeah.

1538
01:08:04,360 --> 01:08:05,193
Right.
Yeah.

1539
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:06,940
Well as artists,
right?

1540
01:08:06,941 --> 01:08:07,690
Like,
does that,

1541
01:08:07,690 --> 01:08:09,320
like,
as as an artist,

1542
01:08:09,321 --> 01:08:10,154
does that inspire you when you see,
like if you go to see a great movie or 

1543
01:08:12,850 --> 01:08:14,230
read a great book or something like 
that,

1544
01:08:14,500 --> 01:08:15,980
does that inspire you to want to

1545
01:08:15,980 --> 01:08:16,813
create?

1546
01:08:18,350 --> 01:08:19,183
Yeah.
It doesn't inspire me to create a write 

1547
01:08:21,831 --> 01:08:22,400
a book.
Right,

1548
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:23,233
right,
right.

1549
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:24,620
But,
um,

1550
01:08:25,160 --> 01:08:26,740
I think I kind of know what my lane is 
right.

1551
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:27,680
This point.
Yeah.

1552
01:08:28,380 --> 01:08:29,830
I try and stay in it.
Yeah.

1553
01:08:30,110 --> 01:08:31,600
Um,
but yeah,

1554
01:08:31,601 --> 01:08:32,810
I mean,
I definitely go see you,

1555
01:08:32,900 --> 01:08:34,510
uh,
uh,

1556
01:08:34,660 --> 01:08:36,310
a movie or,
or,

1557
01:08:37,100 --> 01:08:39,030
or read,
uh,

1558
01:08:39,730 --> 01:08:40,563
you know,
and,

1559
01:08:40,730 --> 01:08:41,563
and it,
it'll get my creative juices flowing 

1560
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:45,860
and,
you know,

1561
01:08:45,861 --> 01:08:50,720
inspired me to be just be better and try
and contribute,

1562
01:08:50,810 --> 01:08:51,643
you know what I mean?
Contributes something good or be 

1563
01:08:53,001 --> 01:08:53,834
positive and make,
make myself feel something to make 

1564
01:08:56,421 --> 01:08:58,650
somebody else feel something.
I Dunno.

1565
01:08:58,660 --> 01:08:59,840
It,
it does something to me.

1566
01:08:59,841 --> 01:09:01,040
Definitely.
It's hard to describe.

1567
01:09:01,041 --> 01:09:05,900
I was still can't describe what it is 
that makes this creative thing,

1568
01:09:06,520 --> 01:09:11,270
um,
click or explain how I do what I do.

1569
01:09:11,271 --> 01:09:16,270
But you definitely see in movies or 
hearing,

1570
01:09:16,280 --> 01:09:17,180
you know,
here and um,

1571
01:09:18,920 --> 01:09:21,440
you know,
like great musicians,

1572
01:09:21,441 --> 01:09:23,690
great guitar players,
you know,

1573
01:09:23,691 --> 01:09:27,110
the freak me out.
Oh Shit,

1574
01:09:27,510 --> 01:09:29,450
don't get too involved a little bit,
you know what I mean?

1575
01:09:29,451 --> 01:09:31,770
And I'm like,
just hold the hunger,

1576
01:09:31,840 --> 01:09:32,730
but yeah,
no,

1577
01:09:32,731 --> 01:09:33,280
it's like,

1578
01:09:33,280 --> 01:09:34,130
okay,
I respect that.

1579
01:09:34,160 --> 01:09:37,180
Let me go get on my game and do my 
thing.

1580
01:09:37,240 --> 01:09:38,073
There was this,
uh,

1581
01:09:40,170 --> 01:09:41,290
ah,
man,

1582
01:09:41,291 --> 01:09:45,610
there was this a guitar player,
um,

1583
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:50,470
down in Austin,
Texas who I haven't seen in awhile.

1584
01:09:50,620 --> 01:09:51,453
And uh,
his name is Derek O'brian is one of the 

1585
01:09:53,771 --> 01:09:56,140
greatest blues guitar players in the 
world.

1586
01:09:56,141 --> 01:09:59,500
Played backed up muddy waters.
Um,

1587
01:10:00,130 --> 01:10:02,800
Albert Collins,
Albert can't,

1588
01:10:02,801 --> 01:10:05,710
everybody's like in the house band at 
Anton says this club.

1589
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:09,110
Um,
I hadn't seen him in awhile.

1590
01:10:09,190 --> 01:10:13,000
And so I go back home and I got my 
little reputation and you know,

1591
01:10:13,030 --> 01:10:13,870
people are like,
ah,

1592
01:10:13,871 --> 01:10:16,390
you know this by that,
that,

1593
01:10:17,170 --> 01:10:17,741
you know,
I'm like,

1594
01:10:17,741 --> 01:10:20,290
all right,
I know my strengths and weaknesses,

1595
01:10:20,340 --> 01:10:25,340
but I was feeling good about myself and 
then I got up on stage and let this,

1596
01:10:25,690 --> 01:10:28,330
you know,
this guy was just ripping it and I just,

1597
01:10:28,360 --> 01:10:29,740
in that moment I was like,

1598
01:10:33,470 --> 01:10:36,620
I ain't got shit on this guy.
You know what that's like.

1599
01:10:36,860 --> 01:10:38,630
It was,
it was a nice reality check.

1600
01:10:38,631 --> 01:10:39,464
So I immediately went back and started 
shedding and I've been kind of doing it 

1601
01:10:43,341 --> 01:10:44,570
since.
Yeah,

1602
01:10:44,571 --> 01:10:47,760
that's a beautiful thing about being 
around inspiring artists.

1603
01:10:47,761 --> 01:10:52,760
It's one of the cool things about being 
in a place like an la or Nashville or if

1604
01:10:52,761 --> 01:10:54,620
you're a musician,
if that's your style,

1605
01:10:54,621 --> 01:10:55,454
I'm music or Austin or anywhere where 
there's a good group of people that are 

1606
01:10:59,181 --> 01:11:02,540
also doing the same thing.
So you use those people and they use you

1607
01:11:02,541 --> 01:11:04,220
and everybody's like fuel for each 
other.

1608
01:11:04,900 --> 01:11:05,733
Yeah,

1609
01:11:05,780 --> 01:11:06,501
yeah,
definitely.

1610
01:11:06,501 --> 01:11:07,740
That's,
um,

1611
01:11:08,110 --> 01:11:08,943
I'm starting to kind of figure out the 
scenes here and in La a little bit more 

1612
01:11:12,771 --> 01:11:13,351
as well.
You know,

1613
01:11:13,351 --> 01:11:18,351
I went out the other night and had like 
this sitting in a jazz musicians and you

1614
01:11:19,711 --> 01:11:20,544
know,
really like the best of the best people 

1615
01:11:23,521 --> 01:11:25,660
are on top of their game.
Folks who can read charts.

1616
01:11:26,160 --> 01:11:31,160
Yeah.
When you do you practice,

1617
01:11:33,330 --> 01:11:36,690
like do you go to like are there certain
clubs that I'm a musician,

1618
01:11:36,691 --> 01:11:39,180
like you can go and just fuck around 
with new stuff.

1619
01:11:39,181 --> 01:11:40,014
Like for standups,
we'll go to the comedy store and we'll 

1620
01:11:42,811 --> 01:11:45,510
practice or we'll go to the Improv and 
we'll practice.

1621
01:11:45,511 --> 01:11:47,720
Like if I have some new bits and I'm 
working on right,

1622
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:49,440
I will go there and I'll air them out.

1623
01:11:50,420 --> 01:11:51,320
Right.
Um,

1624
01:11:53,450 --> 01:11:54,283
yeah.
In,

1625
01:11:54,710 --> 01:11:56,120
in Austin,
well,

1626
01:11:56,780 --> 01:11:58,260
from,
there's this spa,

1627
01:11:58,280 --> 01:12:00,980
every Sunday I'll have a blues jam,
you know?

1628
01:12:01,250 --> 01:12:03,820
And uh,
so yeah.

1629
01:12:04,820 --> 01:12:05,653
Yeah.
You would either go sit in with people 

1630
01:12:08,901 --> 01:12:11,600
that you don't know I haven't played 
with before or whatever and,

1631
01:12:12,250 --> 01:12:14,340
you know,
try out some new chords.

1632
01:12:14,360 --> 01:12:17,120
Maybe you learned something fancy that 
could,

1633
01:12:17,490 --> 01:12:18,950
you know,
transition chord,

1634
01:12:19,340 --> 01:12:20,173
you know,
to go from the one to five on a 

1635
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:25,400
turnaround in this little blue is 
whatever,

1636
01:12:25,401 --> 01:12:26,840
and the key to see whatever,
you know.

1637
01:12:26,841 --> 01:12:30,800
So you'd go work that out and um,
or you bring your squad.

1638
01:12:30,830 --> 01:12:31,670
I mean,
me and my buddies,

1639
01:12:31,671 --> 01:12:36,671
a potter when he plays in my band,
we would go up sometimes and no,

1640
01:12:38,390 --> 01:12:39,223
a drummer that kind of knew how we 
floated and the Bass player who could 

1641
01:12:41,601 --> 01:12:43,520
pick up on something like,
and we got this new track,

1642
01:12:43,521 --> 01:12:44,510
we're about to fuck people up.

1643
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:47,310
This either would work or it wasn't.
But yeah,

1644
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:48,840
those places.
And um,

1645
01:12:50,370 --> 01:12:51,630
yeah,
that's the kind of the fuel,

1646
01:12:51,930 --> 01:12:54,240
you know,
to be in those spots and be around other

1647
01:12:54,810 --> 01:12:57,270
players and get up and do that thing.
Um,

1648
01:12:58,740 --> 01:12:59,573
yeah,
that's,

1649
01:13:00,590 --> 01:13:02,610
it was nothing like that.
Yeah.

1650
01:13:02,760 --> 01:13:05,580
So for you,
when you create music,

1651
01:13:06,060 --> 01:13:07,170
is it,
um,

1652
01:13:07,470 --> 01:13:09,670
like do you just get an idea,
like how did,

1653
01:13:09,720 --> 01:13:12,030
what does the creation process from,
is it,

1654
01:13:12,031 --> 01:13:15,720
does it vary or is there a specific 
creation process from the moment you get

1655
01:13:15,721 --> 01:13:16,554
an idea to putting it to paper or to 
remembering it and making a song and 

1656
01:13:22,050 --> 01:13:24,480
putting the beat to it and pin it,
putting the sounds to it?

1657
01:13:24,840 --> 01:13:27,720
Um,
it's kind of an unorganized mess.

1658
01:13:27,810 --> 01:13:31,080
I said I haven't figured out a process 
and um,

1659
01:13:32,610 --> 01:13:35,040
I don't think it's a mess.
I think it just comes naturally.

1660
01:13:35,100 --> 01:13:40,100
Like I'll have a guitar and I might,
you know,

1661
01:13:40,620 --> 01:13:45,090
have a chord progression and it'll just 
kind of stick and then I'll put a melody

1662
01:13:45,091 --> 01:13:45,924
over it.
I'll be singing something around the 

1663
01:13:46,981 --> 01:13:50,760
house and grabbed the guitar and put 
that together.

1664
01:13:50,761 --> 01:13:53,220
Or um,
you know,

1665
01:13:53,280 --> 01:13:54,113
technology.
I love being able to travel and you 

1666
01:13:56,411 --> 01:13:57,151
know,
I travel a lot,

1667
01:13:57,151 --> 01:14:02,151
so on airplane or on the bus I'll pull 
out the NPC or something and kind of put

1668
01:14:02,881 --> 01:14:05,310
in drum tracks and build from there,
whatever.

1669
01:14:05,311 --> 01:14:08,700
So it all just kind of depends on where 
I am.

1670
01:14:08,701 --> 01:14:10,940
And what I have access to and um,

1671
01:14:12,460 --> 01:14:13,293
uh,

1672
01:14:13,500 --> 01:14:16,320
but now having a little one being at 
home,

1673
01:14:16,321 --> 01:14:19,200
I was like,
gotta like take advantage of my time.

1674
01:14:19,201 --> 01:14:21,720
It's like all you have an hour here,
go try and make something happen.

1675
01:14:22,140 --> 01:14:23,580
Right.
So it's ever,

1676
01:14:23,820 --> 01:14:25,290
ever changing it,
but it just,

1677
01:14:25,291 --> 01:14:26,430
whatever feels right.
You know,

1678
01:14:26,610 --> 01:14:29,910
I don't think if,
if it becomes too much of a formula,

1679
01:14:29,911 --> 01:14:32,490
then I think it will lose its,

1680
01:14:34,340 --> 01:14:37,020
uh,
it's

1681
01:14:37,870 --> 01:14:39,400
raw,
organic

1682
01:14:40,170 --> 01:14:41,003
kind of

1683
01:14:42,430 --> 01:14:46,980
what I got into it for,
which is kind of not knowing and not not

1684
01:14:46,990 --> 01:14:48,720
having any rules.
Uh,

1685
01:14:48,790 --> 01:14:51,850
you know,
so yeah,

1686
01:14:51,880 --> 01:14:52,780
it,
it just

1687
01:14:52,910 --> 01:14:55,610
pins.
That's a real common thing that you said

1688
01:14:55,611 --> 01:14:57,500
that a lot of people say that once they 
had a kid,

1689
01:14:57,501 --> 01:14:59,870
they realized that their free time is 
actually precious.

1690
01:15:00,080 --> 01:15:04,230
So because kids demands so much time,
babies demands so much time and you just

1691
01:15:04,250 --> 01:15:06,950
really don't have much to,
you start going,

1692
01:15:06,951 --> 01:15:08,360
okay,
the kid's asleep.

1693
01:15:09,080 --> 01:15:10,280
Let's get to work,
you know,

1694
01:15:10,370 --> 01:15:11,203
and you actually get more done because 
you have children than you did when you 

1695
01:15:15,441 --> 01:15:16,020
were free.

1696
01:15:16,020 --> 01:15:16,853
Oh Man.
I would sit around and eat us single 

1697
01:15:20,940 --> 01:15:23,280
living by myself,
be working on the software,

1698
01:15:23,340 --> 01:15:25,200
eight hours,
I'd have it loop playing,

1699
01:15:26,670 --> 01:15:27,580
you know,
and just,

1700
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:31,080
uh,
let me go get some food.

1701
01:15:31,081 --> 01:15:32,970
I'll come back to that and maybe some 
awesome.

1702
01:15:33,630 --> 01:15:36,420
Maybe I'll get like the genius idea or 
whatever.

1703
01:15:36,810 --> 01:15:38,630
And um,
yeah,

1704
01:15:38,730 --> 01:15:41,820
I spent two months working on one song 
and you know,

1705
01:15:41,930 --> 01:15:44,370
I don't,
you don't have that much time anymore,

1706
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:47,340
so it's blessing,
you know,

1707
01:15:47,360 --> 01:15:49,770
kind of like get your shit together,
you're going to do it or you're not.

1708
01:15:49,980 --> 01:15:50,520
Yeah.

1709
01:15:50,520 --> 01:15:53,080
Louis C ck was the first person to tell 
me that and it didn't,

1710
01:15:53,081 --> 01:15:55,060
it was so counter intuitive.
I was like,

1711
01:15:55,061 --> 01:15:56,110
really?
He's like,

1712
01:15:56,111 --> 01:15:56,861
yeah,
I actually,

1713
01:15:56,861 --> 01:15:57,694
I get a lot more done now that I have 
children than I did when I was free to 

1714
01:16:00,071 --> 01:16:01,600
do whatever I wanted.
He was like,

1715
01:16:01,601 --> 01:16:05,080
now I'm just under the gun all the time.
So that's how I get things done.

1716
01:16:05,690 --> 01:16:07,370
Yeah.
Well creatively,

1717
01:16:07,371 --> 01:16:08,204
I guess for me,
I mean we spend so much time out on the 

1718
01:16:11,331 --> 01:16:12,590
road,
like we're gone a lot,

1719
01:16:13,040 --> 01:16:17,300
so it's a kind of need,
my quiet time.

1720
01:16:17,630 --> 01:16:18,463
And there's not really a lot of quiet 
time with a bunch of dudes hanging 

1721
01:16:21,981 --> 01:16:24,050
around,
smelled like ass.

1722
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:28,350
Yeah.
Um,

1723
01:16:29,450 --> 01:16:30,130
yeah.
It's just,

1724
01:16:30,130 --> 01:16:30,963
it's,
it's a lot and I can't really function 

1725
01:16:33,051 --> 01:16:34,970
that way,
so I kind of have to be home in order to

1726
01:16:34,971 --> 01:16:38,300
be creative and do that.

1727
01:16:39,150 --> 01:16:39,983
When you go on the road,
do you do like long stretches like you 

1728
01:16:41,771 --> 01:16:42,604
on the road for like two months at a 
time and have a bunch of dates laid out 

1729
01:16:44,881 --> 01:16:45,550
for you?

1730
01:16:45,550 --> 01:16:46,271
Yeah,
we,

1731
01:16:46,271 --> 01:16:47,104
I mean,
we take off here next week and we're 

1732
01:16:49,960 --> 01:16:51,830
pretty much gone,
um,

1733
01:16:53,230 --> 01:16:54,063
until

1734
01:16:57,520 --> 01:16:59,390
maybe August or something.
Whoa.

1735
01:17:00,100 --> 01:17:02,040
I mean,
we will have a few days here and there.

1736
01:17:02,060 --> 01:17:04,260
I'll come back home and uh,
you know,

1737
01:17:04,261 --> 01:17:06,780
we'll be in when you bring your family.
Yeah.

1738
01:17:06,781 --> 01:17:09,980
Yeah.
They'll come with me sometimes and um,

1739
01:17:12,140 --> 01:17:12,980
yeah,
like we just,

1740
01:17:13,170 --> 01:17:16,310
they just came with us.
We were in Australia and you know,

1741
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:19,050
just did the whole trip,
you know,

1742
01:17:19,380 --> 01:17:20,960
on the planes,
everything.

1743
01:17:21,460 --> 01:17:22,760
Woo.
That flight.

1744
01:17:23,260 --> 01:17:24,920
Yeah.
That fight racks you,

1745
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:27,380
it's not my favorite.
It's not my favorite either.

1746
01:17:27,740 --> 01:17:29,180
I kind of hate it.
Yeah.

1747
01:17:29,181 --> 01:17:31,070
Somebody just offered me a trip to New 
Zealand,

1748
01:17:31,071 --> 01:17:32,780
a vacation trip to New Zealand.
I was like,

1749
01:17:32,870 --> 01:17:35,640
bitch,
that's not a vacation work.

1750
01:17:37,070 --> 01:17:40,160
16 hours of the fucking plane or 
whatever the hell it is.

1751
01:17:40,161 --> 01:17:40,920
Like,
come on.

1752
01:17:40,920 --> 01:17:42,420
It doesn't,
there's nothing vacation.

1753
01:17:42,421 --> 01:17:43,650
He about that,
Eh,

1754
01:17:43,780 --> 01:17:45,530
I,
it's beautiful over there,

1755
01:17:45,560 --> 01:17:46,393
you know?
But by the time he can get over that 

1756
01:17:47,771 --> 01:17:49,280
you're tired,
you just want to go back home.

1757
01:17:49,550 --> 01:17:50,383
I would think that it would be a 
vacation for someone who didn't travel 

1758
01:17:52,071 --> 01:17:54,260
all the time.
But for someone like you or someone like

1759
01:17:54,261 --> 01:17:56,060
me who's always traveling,
it's like,

1760
01:17:56,061 --> 01:17:57,230
what?
Yeah.

1761
01:17:57,950 --> 01:17:59,930
Yeah.
I kinda like to be at home.

1762
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:02,210
Yeah.
Kind of boring that way.

1763
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:05,480
It's like I could be at my house for 
like three days straight.

1764
01:18:05,720 --> 01:18:06,553
Yeah.
But that's also because you travel so 

1765
01:18:07,371 --> 01:18:09,350
much.
It's in direct contrast to that.

1766
01:18:09,351 --> 01:18:11,480
So it's a welcome change.
Right.

1767
01:18:11,481 --> 01:18:15,770
But I got guys on my crew who get right 
off tour and just go hit it.

1768
01:18:16,220 --> 01:18:17,090
Yeah.
Yeah.

1769
01:18:17,210 --> 01:18:18,550
Single guys though.
No.

1770
01:18:19,070 --> 01:18:19,821
Really?
Yeah.

1771
01:18:19,821 --> 01:18:21,020
Like,
get off the plane,

1772
01:18:21,680 --> 01:18:22,690
uh,
you know,

1773
01:18:22,760 --> 01:18:26,050
from the tour.
And then just like boss up,

1774
01:18:26,060 --> 01:18:28,240
my boy went to Cuba.
Well,

1775
01:18:28,250 --> 01:18:31,940
like going on tour for,
for it seemed like what forever.

1776
01:18:31,941 --> 01:18:34,730
And then he's like chilling and Cuba,
but like why?

1777
01:18:34,731 --> 01:18:36,020
And that seems exhausting.

1778
01:18:38,310 --> 01:18:42,320
But Cuba is one of those places though.
I think I need to go to,

1779
01:18:43,460 --> 01:18:45,230
I think I need to go do it before it 
changes.

1780
01:18:45,260 --> 01:18:46,610
It's,
yeah.

1781
01:18:46,730 --> 01:18:48,050
So soon.
Yeah.

1782
01:18:48,290 --> 01:18:51,050
Cause right now there's no internet.
They don't have any internet.

1783
01:18:51,230 --> 01:18:53,480
Right.
You can't keep track your emails.

1784
01:18:53,530 --> 01:18:54,363
There's like a couple spots we need to 
get like three g my boy Chris Christian 

1785
01:18:57,471 --> 01:18:58,640
and found them.
Yeah.

1786
01:18:58,700 --> 01:19:00,380
How he found them.
He found them.

1787
01:19:00,410 --> 01:19:02,690
He was like,
I love it.

1788
01:19:02,750 --> 01:19:04,190
What's up Chris?
He goes,

1789
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:06,710
he goes,
I'm going down to queue.

1790
01:19:06,711 --> 01:19:09,410
I'm not going to be able to,
I'm not going to be able to uh,

1791
01:19:09,650 --> 01:19:11,780
get in touch with you.
Um,

1792
01:19:12,200 --> 01:19:13,040
and I was like,
all right man,

1793
01:19:13,070 --> 01:19:13,641
you know,
I get it.

1794
01:19:13,641 --> 01:19:14,361
Cool,
have fun.

1795
01:19:14,361 --> 01:19:16,150
And then I get this call from this weird
number.

1796
01:19:16,350 --> 01:19:16,791
He's like,
Yo,

1797
01:19:16,791 --> 01:19:18,950
he fell in the one spot and I was like,
man,

1798
01:19:18,951 --> 01:19:20,570
why don't you just enjoy,
you know,

1799
01:19:20,600 --> 01:19:21,433
chill out.

1800
01:19:21,460 --> 01:19:25,580
Just be off the for a minute.
Yeah.

1801
01:19:25,960 --> 01:19:29,090
Sorry.
It's one of the things I like most about

1802
01:19:29,100 --> 01:19:31,700
a hunting trips.
Like a lot of them,

1803
01:19:31,730 --> 01:19:33,680
you're in places where you don't have a 
choice.

1804
01:19:33,950 --> 01:19:36,200
You're in the middle of a mountain.
Nothing up here,

1805
01:19:36,201 --> 01:19:37,070
dude.
Nothing.

1806
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:39,140
You might be able to get to the top of a
mountain,

1807
01:19:39,141 --> 01:19:42,620
send someone a text message.
They might not be able to reply and they

1808
01:19:42,621 --> 01:19:43,454
might not even get it.
I might just get lost in the air 

1809
01:19:45,290 --> 01:19:48,350
somewhere.
That's kind of where I need to go to the

1810
01:19:48,351 --> 01:19:50,240
go.
I'm write my songs,

1811
01:19:51,020 --> 01:19:53,360
get out.
So hunting trips,

1812
01:19:53,361 --> 01:19:55,250
dude,
I saw this thing.

1813
01:19:55,370 --> 01:19:57,980
You,
it's like this big ass all.

1814
01:19:57,981 --> 01:20:00,260
Is it like a moose?
Oh,

1815
01:20:00,261 --> 01:20:01,580
Moose leg.
Yeah.

1816
01:20:01,910 --> 01:20:02,743
It's like walking through that airport,
walking through somewhere and I was 

1817
01:20:05,211 --> 01:20:06,410
like,
what the fuck?

1818
01:20:07,630 --> 01:20:08,040
I felt

1819
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:10,110
like this small of a,
like a man.

1820
01:20:10,111 --> 01:20:10,944
I was like,
dude,

1821
01:20:11,190 --> 01:20:12,910
this guy is beast mode.
Right?

1822
01:20:14,600 --> 01:20:15,460
Well,
um,

1823
01:20:15,750 --> 01:20:16,583
that was,
uh,

1824
01:20:16,590 --> 01:20:17,423
intentionally they wanted to make 
something that was like as in your face 

1825
01:20:22,351 --> 01:20:25,320
about the realities of meat as possible.
Right.

1826
01:20:25,560 --> 01:20:26,393
You know,
I got into it with some people on 

1827
01:20:28,441 --> 01:20:31,530
twitter the other day cause I like,
I like to troll vegans occasionally.

1828
01:20:32,130 --> 01:20:32,963
I see you cause someone was making,
there were some making some stupid shit 

1829
01:20:35,281 --> 01:20:37,050
saying that saturated fats are terrible 
for you.

1830
01:20:37,051 --> 01:20:38,950
Like they're the another not,
they're not there.

1831
01:20:38,951 --> 01:20:39,784
Scientific studies that show saturated 
fats are actually healthy for you and 

1832
01:20:43,171 --> 01:20:44,004
important for you.
But people think that if you hunt or if 

1833
01:20:46,801 --> 01:20:47,634
you're involved somehow in animals that 
year sometime sometimes eating animals 

1834
01:20:50,251 --> 01:20:51,720
that you're a cruel person,
that you,

1835
01:20:52,170 --> 01:20:55,290
you want to hurt animals.
You want to cause pain and suffering.

1836
01:20:55,420 --> 01:20:56,340
The,
no,

1837
01:20:56,580 --> 01:20:58,050
I don't,
I don't want to have anything to do with

1838
01:20:58,051 --> 01:21:00,990
factory farming because I don't want to 
be involved in that.

1839
01:21:01,260 --> 01:21:02,093
But the animals that I'm out hunting,
like if I don't get them a wolf's get 

1840
01:21:06,780 --> 01:21:09,240
them or a coyote getting him or her 
mountain lions getting,

1841
01:21:09,241 --> 01:21:10,650
I'm like,
they're not living forever.

1842
01:21:10,770 --> 01:21:13,860
They have a very short window of time.
Whether they're alive,

1843
01:21:14,100 --> 01:21:14,701
they're,
if they're,

1844
01:21:14,701 --> 01:21:17,520
if they make it,
if a deere makes it a six years old that

1845
01:21:17,521 --> 01:21:20,670
is a really old deer and most of them 
they die.

1846
01:21:20,700 --> 01:21:21,533
Long before that when I'm doing is I'm 
stumped dipping my feet into that wild 

1847
01:21:25,621 --> 01:21:29,730
world and I'm pulling something out of 
it and that's where I get all my protein

1848
01:21:29,731 --> 01:21:32,010
from or all my animal protein.
I don't,

1849
01:21:32,250 --> 01:21:34,020
I love animals.
I think they're amazing.

1850
01:21:34,021 --> 01:21:35,940
I have cats at home.
I have dogs.

1851
01:21:36,720 --> 01:21:37,553
It's not a cruelty to animals thing and 
this is something that I used to think 

1852
01:21:41,581 --> 01:21:45,600
of when I thought of hunters.
Like I saw some telephone shores.

1853
01:21:45,601 --> 01:21:47,370
Hunter had a dog and he's petting his 
dog.

1854
01:21:47,371 --> 01:21:48,204
I was like,
how's this motherfucker differentiate 

1855
01:21:49,261 --> 01:21:51,780
between this dog and some deer?
He's gonna like,

1856
01:21:51,781 --> 01:21:52,860
shoot,
it's the lungs out.

1857
01:21:52,861 --> 01:21:55,230
Like how that's Kinda fucked up.
It's kind of weird.

1858
01:21:56,280 --> 01:21:59,430
But then I got it.
Like the dog is a killer too,

1859
01:21:59,431 --> 01:22:03,870
man.
Everything life eats life and it's not a

1860
01:22:03,871 --> 01:22:04,704
matter of being cruel.
It's a matter of sustainability and 

1861
01:22:07,741 --> 01:22:10,650
being alive.
Then there's the reality of hunting.

1862
01:22:10,651 --> 01:22:13,440
Then not everybody can hunt.
Not Everybody has the time.

1863
01:22:13,441 --> 01:22:16,470
Not everybody wants to,
especially in the world that we're,

1864
01:22:16,500 --> 01:22:17,333
we've grown up in with the cities and 
it's something that took me several 

1865
01:22:20,640 --> 01:22:21,473
years to sort of get into it and really 
understand what it's all about and 

1866
01:22:23,550 --> 01:22:24,540
educate myself.

1867
01:22:25,230 --> 01:22:26,063
And then once I did educate myself,
one of the most compelling things was 

1868
01:22:28,621 --> 01:22:31,980
how ignorant most people are about the 
facts of hunting,

1869
01:22:32,370 --> 01:22:35,730
about the facts of wildlife,
about wildlife management,

1870
01:22:35,731 --> 01:22:37,410
and about just where their food comes 
from.

1871
01:22:37,620 --> 01:22:41,580
And even about how many animals die 
making grain.

1872
01:22:41,700 --> 01:22:43,020
How many of my people say,
you know,

1873
01:22:43,021 --> 01:22:43,854
I only eat,
I only keen and fucking Alfalfa and 

1874
01:22:47,550 --> 01:22:48,383
guess what?
That shit's getting chopped up in a 

1875
01:22:49,381 --> 01:22:50,214
combine.
And it's chewing up bunnies and fawns 

1876
01:22:52,381 --> 01:22:56,340
and rats and mice and sparrows and 
ground nesting birds and,

1877
01:22:57,360 --> 01:22:58,193
and you're removing the habitat when you
growing food like that for a lot of 

1878
01:23:01,201 --> 01:23:02,034
different wildlife,
wildlife gets displaced and the 

1879
01:23:03,751 --> 01:23:06,430
displaced wildlife wind getting preyed 
on this.

1880
01:23:06,431 --> 01:23:07,264
It's like there's a lot of factors 
involved in gathering food and when 

1881
01:23:11,021 --> 01:23:11,854
we're living in cities,
we're living in this bizarre natural 

1882
01:23:15,641 --> 01:23:16,474
environment.
And when I say cities are a natural 

1883
01:23:17,801 --> 01:23:18,634
environment,
they are a natural environment because 

1884
01:23:19,991 --> 01:23:20,680
they're there.

1885
01:23:20,680 --> 01:23:21,513
They're everywhere.
They're a natural environment for 

1886
01:23:22,871 --> 01:23:23,704
people.
Like anybody says the cities aren't 

1887
01:23:24,671 --> 01:23:26,170
natural man.
Well,

1888
01:23:26,171 --> 01:23:29,050
how come there's so many of them?
Like what is nature?

1889
01:23:29,051 --> 01:23:31,240
What does a beehive,
is it a beehive nature?

1890
01:23:31,350 --> 01:23:32,530
A beehive is nature,
right?

1891
01:23:32,650 --> 01:23:33,970
Well,
that's a fucking be city.

1892
01:23:34,180 --> 01:23:35,320
Okay?
They've created a city.

1893
01:23:35,350 --> 01:23:36,850
They know how to do it.
They do it everywhere.

1894
01:23:37,090 --> 01:23:37,923
That's the same goddamn thing people do.
We create these super complicated 

1895
01:23:40,541 --> 01:23:43,210
beehives are call them cities and we 
create them all over the world,

1896
01:23:43,300 --> 01:23:44,820
right?
It's not like this one city.

1897
01:23:44,821 --> 01:23:46,210
And we're like,
what the fuck is that?

1898
01:23:46,990 --> 01:23:49,300
The cities are everywhere.
They are people.

1899
01:23:49,630 --> 01:23:50,463
And when people figure shit out and they
have electricity and they have 

1900
01:23:52,631 --> 01:23:55,480
agriculture,
then they have surplus and then they,

1901
01:23:55,530 --> 01:23:58,420
they put up fucking walls and make 
buildings and then boom,

1902
01:23:58,421 --> 01:24:00,220
we got a city and they're everywhere.
You look,

1903
01:24:00,670 --> 01:24:03,250
I think,
I think there's,

1904
01:24:03,370 --> 01:24:07,840
there's just some strange detachment 
from where our food comes from when it's

1905
01:24:07,841 --> 01:24:09,340
shipped in and trucks all the time.

1906
01:24:09,640 --> 01:24:12,290
So my,
uh,

1907
01:24:13,090 --> 01:24:13,923
education into the world of hunting,
a big part of it was like to try to 

1908
01:24:16,631 --> 01:24:17,464
figure out,
like,

1909
01:24:18,070 --> 01:24:21,730
I try to figure out bizarre things,
like things that don't make sense to me.

1910
01:24:21,760 --> 01:24:23,980
I try to figure out,
I tried to figure out,

1911
01:24:24,060 --> 01:24:24,893
uh,
all sorts of weird misconceptions and 

1912
01:24:26,741 --> 01:24:27,574
misunderstandings.
I this what fascinates me about people 

1913
01:24:30,251 --> 01:24:32,830
that are involved in cults.
So it fascinates me,

1914
01:24:32,831 --> 01:24:37,690
but people that have bad conceptions or 
bad thoughts about psychedelics that are

1915
01:24:37,691 --> 01:24:39,490
untrue,
like people would think that,

1916
01:24:39,491 --> 01:24:41,710
you know,
certain things or make it to make you go

1917
01:24:41,711 --> 01:24:43,180
crazy and lose your mind.
What,

1918
01:24:43,181 --> 01:24:43,961
well,
why is that?

1919
01:24:43,961 --> 01:24:44,830
What makes people,
oh,

1920
01:24:44,890 --> 01:24:46,990
well there's propaganda films for the 
1930s.

1921
01:24:47,200 --> 01:24:48,033
Well,
what started that while it was a guy 

1922
01:24:48,461 --> 01:24:49,294
named William Randolph hearst,
I'll actually profited from marijuana 

1923
01:24:51,671 --> 01:24:52,481
being illegal.
Like,

1924
01:24:52,481 --> 01:24:53,260
oh,
okay.

1925
01:24:53,260 --> 01:24:55,540
And he get,
I'm fascinated by shit like that.

1926
01:24:55,600 --> 01:24:57,550
So the food thing was always fascinating
to me.

1927
01:24:57,551 --> 01:24:58,384
Like how was actually just go to a store
and you get a piece of meat and we have 

1928
01:25:01,061 --> 01:25:02,740
no idea where the fuck this meat came 
from.

1929
01:25:02,741 --> 01:25:04,120
We'd literally just,
we don't even care.

1930
01:25:04,270 --> 01:25:05,680
We throw it in the supermarket,
you know,

1931
01:25:05,710 --> 01:25:07,450
throw it in the cart,
go through supermarket,

1932
01:25:07,451 --> 01:25:08,284
give that guy a piece of plastic.
He runs it through the machine and 

1933
01:25:10,001 --> 01:25:12,310
you're out the door.
It's strange.

1934
01:25:12,340 --> 01:25:15,610
It's very odd when that's a piece of 
life.

1935
01:25:16,960 --> 01:25:18,640
Yeah,
I think about that too,

1936
01:25:18,910 --> 01:25:21,670
but I don't hunt,
but do you eat me?

1937
01:25:21,940 --> 01:25:24,640
I do,
but it's not guilty.

1938
01:25:24,670 --> 01:25:28,750
It's normal.
Deep meet everybody like 90% this is the

1939
01:25:28,751 --> 01:25:33,700
fact of the world eats meat.
He right 90 95 depending on who you ask,

1940
01:25:33,970 --> 01:25:37,270
but it's at least 90 of the world eats 
meat.

1941
01:25:37,420 --> 01:25:39,370
Even Vegetarians,
most vegetarian,

1942
01:25:39,610 --> 01:25:41,770
some asshole said to me the other day,
hilarious.

1943
01:25:41,950 --> 01:25:43,840
He goes,
I'm 90% vegetarian and I think,

1944
01:25:43,990 --> 01:25:45,160
oh,
shut the fuck up.

1945
01:25:45,610 --> 01:25:48,640
Does you can't say that?
How do you do that with how?

1946
01:25:48,700 --> 01:25:51,160
That's not 90% vegetarian.
That's not real.

1947
01:25:51,400 --> 01:25:55,660
There's no such thing as 90% vegetarian.
You are 100% not vegetarian.

1948
01:25:55,780 --> 01:25:59,350
If you eat meat,
that's not 90% vegetarian.

1949
01:26:00,520 --> 01:26:01,353
He's an asshole.
He's a convenient moral ground asshole 

1950
01:26:04,520 --> 01:26:07,190
who's just trying to let everybody know 
he's better than you because most of the

1951
01:26:07,191 --> 01:26:10,400
time he doesn't eat meat.
Just fuck you.

1952
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:12,910
Yeah,
I'll just go ahead and shut the fuck up.

1953
01:26:15,880 --> 01:26:17,180
Well,
he was just trying to be,

1954
01:26:17,250 --> 01:26:21,260
make an argument against hunting and a 
about about people who do it.

1955
01:26:21,410 --> 01:26:22,101
You know,
it's just,

1956
01:26:22,101 --> 01:26:22,934
he's a fool,
but it's convenient for people because 

1957
01:26:25,461 --> 01:26:27,980
they're completely detached on,
on a daily basis.

1958
01:26:27,981 --> 01:26:30,770
If you go to your office every day,
you wake up in the morning,

1959
01:26:30,771 --> 01:26:32,660
you have your breakfast,
you drive to work,

1960
01:26:32,900 --> 01:26:34,700
you go to work.
At the end of the day,

1961
01:26:34,701 --> 01:26:35,950
you go to the gym,
you go home,

1962
01:26:35,960 --> 01:26:37,520
you watch a little television,
you crash,

1963
01:26:37,670 --> 01:26:38,503
you get up in the morning,
you do that again and you do it five 

1964
01:26:39,891 --> 01:26:42,110
days a week.
You're left with two fucking days,

1965
01:26:42,350 --> 01:26:43,790
two days,
Saturday and Sunday.

1966
01:26:43,820 --> 01:26:45,800
If you're lucky.
And if you have family,

1967
01:26:45,980 --> 01:26:48,410
those days are spoken for.
If you have friends,

1968
01:26:48,440 --> 01:26:50,060
those days are spoken for.
If you have hobbies,

1969
01:26:50,330 --> 01:26:52,390
so where's your gathering food come 
from?

1970
01:26:52,430 --> 01:26:54,410
Like you,
you have to make a concerted effort.

1971
01:26:54,410 --> 01:26:55,243
If you really want to be a part of this,
if you really want to deeply understand 

1972
01:27:00,891 --> 01:27:01,724
where your food comes from,
you have to make a concerted effort to 

1973
01:27:03,501 --> 01:27:04,334
either grow it or acquire it.
Like somehow or another you have to go 

1974
01:27:06,711 --> 01:27:07,544
to a farm and talk to the people that 
are growing the food and buy it from 

1975
01:27:10,011 --> 01:27:11,600
them.
Go to a farmer's market.

1976
01:27:11,601 --> 01:27:13,760
You can meet them like,
I go to farmer's markets.

1977
01:27:13,840 --> 01:27:14,673
It's kind of cool.
I like meeting the people that work on 

1978
01:27:16,431 --> 01:27:18,620
the farms.
I asked them to talk to them about it.

1979
01:27:19,310 --> 01:27:22,250
But the meat thing is the big 
detachment.

1980
01:27:22,251 --> 01:27:24,260
Everybody kind of understands.
You plant a seed,

1981
01:27:24,261 --> 01:27:25,820
you water it,
tomato comes out,

1982
01:27:26,150 --> 01:27:28,760
they kind of get that.
But the animal part,

1983
01:27:29,150 --> 01:27:29,983
the vast majority of people who eat meat
just do not understand the whole 

1984
01:27:33,621 --> 01:27:34,880
process.
They don't,

1985
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:36,500
they don't want to know.

1986
01:27:36,560 --> 01:27:38,060
They,
they just buy a burger.

1987
01:27:39,770 --> 01:27:40,830
Yeah.
Uh,

1988
01:27:41,540 --> 01:27:45,830
I'm starting to know a little bit more 
and it freaks me out of it.

1989
01:27:46,220 --> 01:27:49,210
It's a freak out,
but you know,

1990
01:27:49,550 --> 01:27:50,383
it's a freak out.
I haven't quite switched over to 

1991
01:27:52,970 --> 01:27:55,480
veganism or going out and hunting.
Yeah,

1992
01:27:55,640 --> 01:27:56,473
well,
my thought was I was going to do one or 

1993
01:27:56,901 --> 01:27:58,520
two things.
I was either going to become a Vegan,

1994
01:27:58,521 --> 01:28:01,040
I was going to become a hunter.
And I became a hunter.

1995
01:28:01,460 --> 01:28:03,890
And one of the reasons why I became a 
hunter is,

1996
01:28:03,980 --> 01:28:05,690
first of all,
the food's delicious.

1997
01:28:05,810 --> 01:28:07,830
It's good for you.
And those animals aren't,

1998
01:28:08,060 --> 01:28:08,893
they're not living forever.
And I becoming fairies and curing 

1999
01:28:11,901 --> 01:28:12,734
cancer,
if you don't shoot them and they're 

2000
01:28:14,061 --> 01:28:15,950
getting eaten by all kinds of shit 
around them,

2001
01:28:15,951 --> 01:28:16,431
you're,
you're just,

2002
01:28:16,431 --> 01:28:19,400
you're just eating them as well.
It's,

2003
01:28:19,401 --> 01:28:21,580
um,
it's a,

2004
01:28:21,581 --> 01:28:25,940
it's a weird disconnect that we have 
about where food comes from.

2005
01:28:25,940 --> 01:28:28,310
And life itself,
like live is not permanent.

2006
01:28:28,311 --> 01:28:29,440
It's temporary.
It's,

2007
01:28:29,520 --> 01:28:31,130
it's here and it's gone.
It's fleeting.

2008
01:28:31,370 --> 01:28:33,350
It should be respected,
you know,

2009
01:28:33,380 --> 01:28:34,213
it should be.
And I think one of the best ways to 

2010
01:28:35,661 --> 01:28:38,630
respect these animals in the sounds like
total,

2011
01:28:39,380 --> 01:28:43,010
totally counter intuitive,
but as to cut them and eat them,

2012
01:28:43,340 --> 01:28:45,560
they become a part of your life.
They sustain you.

2013
01:28:45,980 --> 01:28:46,581
They,
you know,

2014
01:28:46,581 --> 01:28:47,414
you,
you have a deep appreciation for them 

2015
01:28:48,861 --> 01:28:51,580
because they literally sustain you 
there.

2016
01:28:51,590 --> 01:28:53,840
Part of what makes you live.
Yeah,

2017
01:28:54,290 --> 01:28:56,600
that's,
that's a real,

2018
01:28:57,650 --> 01:28:59,810
yeah.
We live in Texas,

2019
01:28:59,811 --> 01:29:02,280
a lot of hunting and in Austin

2020
01:29:02,460 --> 01:29:05,100
when you were living there.
And a lot of my friends,

2021
01:29:06,480 --> 01:29:07,313
you know,
they hunt and so you know that they're 

2022
01:29:09,720 --> 01:29:11,280
big on it.
Um,

2023
01:29:11,340 --> 01:29:13,320
did you ever want to go with them?
I,

2024
01:29:13,770 --> 01:29:15,210
I did,
but I had a,

2025
01:29:16,260 --> 01:29:19,410
I had a couple of experiences with guns 
when I was younger.

2026
01:29:20,460 --> 01:29:24,150
That kind of freaked me out from,
from that,

2027
01:29:24,180 --> 01:29:25,013
one of them was me being a kid and I was
like a play gun and I kind of colored 

2028
01:29:31,231 --> 01:29:34,140
the red,
uh,

2029
01:29:34,550 --> 01:29:36,720
like kids say she thing,
you know,

2030
01:29:36,721 --> 01:29:38,210
I,
me and my buddies,

2031
01:29:38,211 --> 01:29:41,350
so he had this like daisy rifle.
I had this little lake,

2032
01:29:42,180 --> 01:29:46,500
I don't remember what it was,
but so we'd just like,

2033
01:29:47,070 --> 01:29:49,170
we're just messing around,
you know,

2034
01:29:49,620 --> 01:29:52,140
actually my kids.
And then this guy comes driving and we,

2035
01:29:52,820 --> 01:29:56,730
it's the point that gun at him and this 
guy swerved off the road,

2036
01:29:57,090 --> 01:29:59,400
hit some mailbox,
like crashes his car.

2037
01:29:59,510 --> 01:30:00,211
He gets out,
he's like,

2038
01:30:00,211 --> 01:30:02,110
what the fuck are you guys doing?
You know,

2039
01:30:02,111 --> 01:30:04,320
I'm nine.
He's like,

2040
01:30:04,321 --> 01:30:06,480
what the fuck are you doing?
You could have killed somebody.

2041
01:30:06,780 --> 01:30:07,613
What the fuck?
Why want to just like toys and you know 

2042
01:30:09,331 --> 01:30:10,164
what I mean?
And,

2043
01:30:10,290 --> 01:30:13,200
and his mom comes out freaking out and 
they didn't know that we did it.

2044
01:30:13,201 --> 01:30:14,280
And My pops was something,
you know,

2045
01:30:14,281 --> 01:30:16,690
you've got to understand this,
you know,

2046
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:17,633
life that here this is serious.
You got to understand this guy didn't 

2047
01:30:20,461 --> 01:30:21,960
know that you,
you're playing web.

2048
01:30:21,961 --> 01:30:23,280
So it kind of freaked me out.
And then,

2049
01:30:23,610 --> 01:30:24,443
um,
I went on one hunting trip and I had 22 

2050
01:30:27,091 --> 01:30:28,980
and he kicked me in the shoulder.
Pretty good.

2051
01:30:29,460 --> 01:30:32,460
22 kicks you and I'm not a 2012 gates.
12 beds.

2052
01:30:32,461 --> 01:30:33,080
Yeah.
Yeah.

2053
01:30:33,080 --> 01:30:33,913
So yeah.

2054
01:30:34,070 --> 01:30:34,701
No,
it was like,

2055
01:30:34,701 --> 01:30:39,701
what?
That's like saying,

2056
01:30:40,400 --> 01:30:42,050
man,
I shot this slingshot one time.

2057
01:30:42,150 --> 01:30:44,770
I broke my hand up.
No.

2058
01:30:45,700 --> 01:30:46,533
Yes.

2059
01:30:46,610 --> 01:30:49,400
12 gauge shotgun and it kicked me pretty
hard.

2060
01:30:49,401 --> 01:30:52,750
And so I just kind of lost interest.
But you know,

2061
01:30:53,160 --> 01:30:54,800
that was,
it was a long ass time ago.

2062
01:30:54,920 --> 01:30:57,170
Suzanne from honey,
honey and wants to go pig hunting.

2063
01:30:57,800 --> 01:31:00,320
Yeah.
So down she keeps bringing it up.

2064
01:31:00,560 --> 01:31:01,393
She's like,
why don't we go with Joe Rogan when we 

2065
01:31:02,331 --> 01:31:03,250
go on pig hunting?
Yeah,

2066
01:31:03,380 --> 01:31:05,710
she's totally down to do it.
Definitely.

2067
01:31:05,750 --> 01:31:07,390
You know,
and my boy Mike,

2068
01:31:07,391 --> 01:31:08,510
where he,
that's what he does all the time.

2069
01:31:08,511 --> 01:31:09,970
It was outside of,
um,

2070
01:31:10,340 --> 01:31:10,900
a little

2071
01:31:10,900 --> 01:31:13,420
outside of Austin.
He's always gone sending me photos,

2072
01:31:13,421 --> 01:31:14,770
sending me videos and,
well,

2073
01:31:14,771 --> 01:31:16,510
in Austin,
like outside of Texas,

2074
01:31:16,511 --> 01:31:19,210
they have a giant problem with pigs.
They have to hunt them.

2075
01:31:19,330 --> 01:31:20,770
You can,
you can go to town on them.

2076
01:31:20,950 --> 01:31:21,910
They're everywhere.
Yeah.

2077
01:31:22,030 --> 01:31:23,380
They have no limits.
You can do it.

2078
01:31:23,381 --> 01:31:25,450
They do it from helicopters.
I mean,

2079
01:31:25,451 --> 01:31:26,284
they have,
they have a whole business called Hella 

2080
01:31:27,731 --> 01:31:32,110
hunting where they take people up in,
in helicopters and they're shooting pigs

2081
01:31:32,111 --> 01:31:32,944
because it's the only way to eradicate 
them from farms because there's so many 

2082
01:31:35,171 --> 01:31:36,004
of them and they do billions of dollars 
worth of damage just in Texas in crop 

2083
01:31:39,611 --> 01:31:43,900
destruction every year there are wild.
I mean,

2084
01:31:43,901 --> 01:31:44,734
there's not,
there's not enough mountain mines and 

2085
01:31:46,091 --> 01:31:49,960
there's no wolves to kill them and 
realize there were so dangerous to,

2086
01:31:50,200 --> 01:31:51,040
oh,
they're very dangerous.

2087
01:31:51,110 --> 01:31:53,320
The big ones especially,
they'll fuck you up.

2088
01:31:53,370 --> 01:31:54,790
That's what I heard.
That's why I said,

2089
01:31:54,791 --> 01:31:57,100
why I don't go out there.
They'll fuck you up.

2090
01:31:57,130 --> 01:31:59,680
They Killed The dad and game of,
right.

2091
01:32:00,010 --> 01:32:01,690
The first king,
the original king,

2092
01:32:02,620 --> 01:32:03,700
the one who,
uh,

2093
01:32:03,790 --> 01:32:04,623
her husband,
the chick who was fucking her brother 

2094
01:32:07,090 --> 01:32:08,710
and the game of thrones,
the hot blonde lady.

2095
01:32:09,070 --> 01:32:11,800
Her husband died because,
uh,

2096
01:32:11,860 --> 01:32:14,170
he got killed by a,
by a pig.

2097
01:32:15,370 --> 01:32:16,390
Wait,
is this in the show?

2098
01:32:16,420 --> 01:32:18,190
I don't know the shell game of throne.
Not Real life.

2099
01:32:18,191 --> 01:32:19,024
You didn't,
I mean in the movie he died from a wild 

2100
01:32:21,101 --> 01:32:24,390
boar,
but they get fucking big too.

2101
01:32:25,400 --> 01:32:29,560
I mean,
a 400 pound wild heart is not uncommon.

2102
01:32:30,190 --> 01:32:33,340
That's real.
I never seen with them in real life.

2103
01:32:33,610 --> 01:32:35,830
They're crazy.
Look and they're all black and they have

2104
01:32:35,860 --> 01:32:39,880
long snouts in their tusks come out.
They have these white tusks.

2105
01:32:39,970 --> 01:32:41,380
Like when you see when it real life,
you're like,

2106
01:32:41,410 --> 01:32:43,540
oh,
you hear him in real life.

2107
01:32:43,930 --> 01:32:44,763
First time I ever went pig hunting,
I was with my friend Steve Rinella and 

2108
01:32:47,351 --> 01:32:49,240
we're on this farm or this a ranch.

2109
01:32:49,240 --> 01:32:51,100
It's not far away from here.
It's huge.

2110
01:32:51,101 --> 01:32:53,500
Biggest ranch in California,
270,000 acres.

2111
01:32:53,501 --> 01:32:55,960
It's called the home ranch.
And um,

2112
01:32:56,350 --> 01:32:57,183
we were walking down this road and we 
heard some snaps and some noises in the 

2113
01:33:00,131 --> 01:33:02,170
bushes,
like it's really thick brush.

2114
01:33:02,410 --> 01:33:03,243
And then we heard these pigs fighting 
with each other and they were like 

2115
01:33:05,260 --> 01:33:10,260
Damon's mass eye and they're like no 
more than 30 yards,

2116
01:33:11,771 --> 01:33:12,604
20 yards away from us.
They're like right there and they're 

2117
01:33:13,931 --> 01:33:16,750
duking it out in the,
and like these are monsters man.

2118
01:33:16,751 --> 01:33:17,584
They sound like monsters.
It freaked me out more than honey bears 

2119
01:33:21,191 --> 01:33:23,530
more than hunting elk but not more than 
elk.

2120
01:33:23,531 --> 01:33:25,840
Elk is probably the biggest freak out 
cause they scream,

2121
01:33:26,170 --> 01:33:27,003
they day bugle and they like a thousand 
pounds and they look majestically they 

2122
01:33:29,951 --> 01:33:32,350
have trees growing out of their head.
These giant antlers.

2123
01:33:32,700 --> 01:33:35,920
And then did you see the antlers that 
are in the front there over by the front

2124
01:33:35,921 --> 01:33:37,180
door is locked in.

2125
01:33:37,210 --> 01:33:38,420
That's elk,
those,

2126
01:33:38,421 --> 01:33:41,020
those,
that's like a thousand pound animal with

2127
01:33:41,021 --> 01:33:44,470
these gigantic,
I mean there they're immense,

2128
01:33:44,471 --> 01:33:47,440
immense majestic animals.
Those are the biggest freak outs.

2129
01:33:47,590 --> 01:33:50,770
Just cause you feel like you're,
you're hunting some mystical creature.

2130
01:33:50,950 --> 01:33:53,530
Where do you find those?
Those were into home ranch two.

2131
01:33:53,531 --> 01:33:55,510
One of them was one of those was from to
hone ranch.

2132
01:33:55,511 --> 01:33:59,380
One of them was from Colorado,
you know,

2133
01:34:00,470 --> 01:34:02,590
rising.
But the pig thing is,

2134
01:34:02,591 --> 01:34:03,424
uh,
it's actually look at that fucking 

2135
01:34:04,961 --> 01:34:06,220
thing,
the size of that thing.

2136
01:34:06,690 --> 01:34:11,440
11 year old hunter bags,
a 1050 pound wild boar.

2137
01:34:12,280 --> 01:34:16,030
What the fuck?
What the fuck?

2138
01:34:16,210 --> 01:34:19,540
First of all with a pistol,
this is a perspective shot,

2139
01:34:19,780 --> 01:34:23,140
which is actually kind of important 
because like that boy is way behind that

2140
01:34:23,141 --> 01:34:25,450
thing.
He's not like right next to it.

2141
01:34:25,451 --> 01:34:27,760
So if he's behind it by just,
you know,

2142
01:34:27,761 --> 01:34:30,090
six or seven feet and the camera's on 
the ground,

2143
01:34:30,091 --> 01:34:31,180
they're shooting at an eye level.

2144
01:34:31,450 --> 01:34:33,370
It makes it look a lot bigger than it 
really is.

2145
01:34:33,400 --> 01:34:35,260
That's how they do it.
Um,

2146
01:34:35,320 --> 01:34:36,153
so,
but a thousand pounds is a fucking 

2147
01:34:38,531 --> 01:34:40,660
thousand pounds.
That's a giant ass pig.

2148
01:34:41,530 --> 01:34:44,170
If you ever seen Hogzilla have I seen 
it?

2149
01:34:44,410 --> 01:34:46,570
If you've seen the images of Hogzilla,
have you heard of this?

2150
01:34:46,630 --> 01:34:49,930
This is like one of the biggest wild 
pigs who was ever killed.

2151
01:34:50,170 --> 01:34:52,480
It was a,
I believe it was in Georgia.

2152
01:34:52,990 --> 01:34:54,460
Yeah.
Is that,

2153
01:34:54,520 --> 01:34:57,100
did they have a photo of Hogzilla check?
There's one.

2154
01:34:57,230 --> 01:34:58,730
It's hanging there.
That one right there,

2155
01:34:58,731 --> 01:34:59,564
Jeremy.
Look at the size of the one that's 

2156
01:35:00,351 --> 01:35:03,520
hanging next to this guy.
Look at the fucking size.

2157
01:35:03,530 --> 01:35:05,570
That thing.
So that's not a perspective shot.

2158
01:35:05,780 --> 01:35:07,610
That guy standing right next to that 
thing.

2159
01:35:09,340 --> 01:35:10,580
What?
Yeah.

2160
01:35:10,581 --> 01:35:14,540
What first of all are those his balls up
a top.

2161
01:35:14,630 --> 01:35:16,820
Cause if that's his balls.
Respect.

2162
01:35:21,910 --> 01:35:22,743
That's a crazy sack.
That's like a couple of watermelons and 

2163
01:35:25,401 --> 01:35:26,450
an old ladies.
Pantyhose.

2164
01:35:27,240 --> 01:35:32,240
What?
It's a giant fucking giant balls.

2165
01:35:32,750 --> 01:35:34,460
How big was it?
Over a thousand pounds?

2166
01:35:34,670 --> 01:35:37,070
Yeah.
No,

2167
01:35:37,240 --> 01:35:37,810
I know.

2168
01:35:37,810 --> 01:35:38,643
Wildly considered widely.
Originally it was widely considered a 

2169
01:35:41,051 --> 01:35:41,884
hoax.
Hmm.

2170
01:35:42,340 --> 01:35:43,173
Well they,
what happens is they take domestic pigs 

2171
01:35:46,361 --> 01:35:50,380
are one of the few animals that morph 
automatically when they get out into the

2172
01:35:50,381 --> 01:35:51,214
wild.
Like if you have a pig and he's your 

2173
01:35:52,511 --> 01:35:55,330
buddy and you let them loose out in the 
forest,

2174
01:35:55,480 --> 01:35:58,180
they change physically.
Their nose gets longer,

2175
01:35:58,390 --> 01:36:02,380
their hair gets shaggier and their teeth
grow along or their tusks grow and their

2176
01:36:02,381 --> 01:36:03,214
behavior changes.
They go feral and they go feral really 

2177
01:36:05,831 --> 01:36:06,664
quickly.
I think within like a couple of months 

2178
01:36:09,310 --> 01:36:12,610
they start physical transformation.
I didn't know that.

2179
01:36:12,640 --> 01:36:15,340
Yeah,
they're weird animal like wild boars and

2180
01:36:15,341 --> 01:36:17,650
wild pigs.
Like do you see a wild boar?

2181
01:36:17,651 --> 01:36:18,484
Like dark hair,
thick scrubby and then you see a pig 

2182
01:36:20,591 --> 01:36:23,410
like at a farm.
Same species.

2183
01:36:23,830 --> 01:36:24,663
Same animal,
which is fucking nuts there that it's 

2184
01:36:27,521 --> 01:36:30,190
all one genus.
It's called [inaudible].

2185
01:36:30,220 --> 01:36:33,850
That's the type of animal it is and they
can interbreed with each other.

2186
01:36:34,180 --> 01:36:35,013
They're the same thing and that's why 
when you go see wild pigs like domestic 

2187
01:36:39,071 --> 01:36:39,904
pigs that get loose and they become 
feral and then they start breeding in 

2188
01:36:42,191 --> 01:36:43,280
the wild.
They the,

2189
01:36:43,300 --> 01:36:45,130
they're black,
they're black.

2190
01:36:45,131 --> 01:36:47,220
They have a thick,
thick coat on the,

2191
01:36:47,290 --> 01:36:48,123
around where their neck area is because 
they fight and they tear each other 

2192
01:36:50,921 --> 01:36:51,754
apart.
So all around like from their face down 

2193
01:36:54,311 --> 01:36:55,144
to like a,
where their heart is on their chest is 

2194
01:36:57,550 --> 01:36:59,050
super thick,
thick,

2195
01:36:59,051 --> 01:37:03,640
hide like the thickest fuck like a shoe,
like the bottom of a shoe.

2196
01:37:03,641 --> 01:37:06,450
It's incredible how thick it is.
So um,

2197
01:37:06,520 --> 01:37:07,353
people that hunt them,
you have to be careful like with bows 

2198
01:37:09,221 --> 01:37:11,020
and arrows that you don't hit them in 
that area.

2199
01:37:11,021 --> 01:37:11,854
Cause like if you have a weak bow know,
pulling back a lot of weight with a 

2200
01:37:14,081 --> 01:37:16,270
really sharp Arrow,
he won't even go through them.

2201
01:37:16,600 --> 01:37:18,350
Do you use a bow?
Sometimes?

2202
01:37:19,010 --> 01:37:21,140
Yeah,
man,

2203
01:37:22,280 --> 01:37:27,280
I had no idea is there's this girl,
she works with this hat shop and uh,

2204
01:37:29,270 --> 01:37:33,680
I walked in and she's got this pet 
fucking pigs.

2205
01:37:33,681 --> 01:37:37,160
I could just imagine that thing like 
getting loose for a couple of months.

2206
01:37:37,161 --> 01:37:40,100
Like have you seen my,
was it a potbelly pig?

2207
01:37:40,101 --> 01:37:42,290
One of those little ones?
Uh,

2208
01:37:42,320 --> 01:37:43,490
yeah.
Is that the same deal?

2209
01:37:43,550 --> 01:37:44,600
No,
I don't think so.

2210
01:37:44,660 --> 01:37:47,130
I think at potbelly pigs or like a,
like a Chore Chihuahua,

2211
01:37:47,770 --> 01:37:48,603
the Chihuahua,
the reality of domestic dogs is that 

2212
01:37:51,811 --> 01:37:54,100
domestic dogs all share,
uh,

2213
01:37:54,210 --> 01:37:57,180
genetics with a,
which means somehow or another,

2214
01:37:57,181 --> 01:38:00,510
we don't exactly know how they did it,
but through selective breeding,

2215
01:38:00,990 --> 01:38:02,700
a wolf became a Chihuahua.

2216
01:38:06,440 --> 01:38:07,890
Yeah.
Well,

2217
01:38:07,990 --> 01:38:08,823
you know,
I was having this conversation with a 

2218
01:38:12,230 --> 01:38:17,230
buddy of mine in Australia of about how 
a Chihuahua became a Chihuahua.

2219
01:38:18,200 --> 01:38:20,600
And what did he say we could,
we didn't know.

2220
01:38:20,660 --> 01:38:22,160
Oh,
we were just like,

2221
01:38:22,161 --> 01:38:23,960
that's how fucking crazy is that.
Well,

2222
01:38:23,961 --> 01:38:26,420
there's no clear map.
It's not like,

2223
01:38:26,421 --> 01:38:27,920
you know,
like a lagger,

2224
01:38:28,030 --> 01:38:28,863
you know,
to lager is like a line mates with a 

2225
01:38:30,441 --> 01:38:31,880
tiger.
It makes a logger.

2226
01:38:32,030 --> 01:38:33,050
Just bad ass.
Yeah.

2227
01:38:33,080 --> 01:38:34,730
Pretty bad as well.
They're also,

2228
01:38:34,731 --> 01:38:37,570
they're so big because they want,
it's either a,

2229
01:38:37,790 --> 01:38:42,740
I think it's a male lion and a female 
tiger and,

2230
01:38:42,770 --> 01:38:43,603
or maybe a male tigers and female line,
but it has to be that specific 

2231
01:38:45,651 --> 01:38:46,484
combination.
And what happens is when that 

2232
01:38:48,531 --> 01:38:49,364
combination takes place,
they don't receive the gene that 

2233
01:38:52,401 --> 01:38:54,890
regulates size.
So they keep growing.

2234
01:38:57,010 --> 01:38:57,843
Yeah.

2235
01:38:58,110 --> 01:38:59,160
They're sort of,
they're enormous.

2236
01:38:59,161 --> 01:39:02,190
They're way bigger than a lion and way 
bigger than a tiger.

2237
01:39:02,520 --> 01:39:04,200
Like laggers are enormous.
They,

2238
01:39:04,320 --> 01:39:05,153
they don't even seem real.
That's why they were in Napoleon 

2239
01:39:07,591 --> 01:39:09,430
dynamite's favorite animal.
Yeah.

2240
01:39:10,950 --> 01:39:13,350
Classic.
A classic by the way.

2241
01:39:13,380 --> 01:39:14,400
But see,
that makes sense.

2242
01:39:14,401 --> 01:39:15,990
Right?
Align mates with a tiger,

2243
01:39:15,991 --> 01:39:18,810
you can see that they have similarities 
in their features.

2244
01:39:18,850 --> 01:39:19,680
Gotcha.
But,

2245
01:39:19,680 --> 01:39:23,520
um,
chihuahuas and all domestic dogs,

2246
01:39:23,521 --> 01:39:25,590
we don't really know.
We,

2247
01:39:25,680 --> 01:39:29,670
there's a lot of speculation and they 
believe that wolves became friendly with

2248
01:39:29,671 --> 01:39:32,580
people because we're feeding them and 
then they become more docile.

2249
01:39:32,840 --> 01:39:33,673
I,
there was a radio lab podcast that 

2250
01:39:35,580 --> 01:39:40,580
talked about breeding foxes and within a
decade they had killed,

2251
01:39:40,770 --> 01:39:41,603
they were breeding foxes and they would 
kill any fox that showed any sort of 

2252
01:39:44,221 --> 01:39:45,054
aggression or any and that there was 
trying to be dominant with a growl at 

2253
01:39:47,821 --> 01:39:49,020
people that any,
any,

2254
01:39:49,021 --> 01:39:50,910
uh,
any unfavorable characteristics,

2255
01:39:50,911 --> 01:39:51,744
they killed them.

2256
01:39:51,900 --> 01:39:52,733
And within 10 years,
the genes change to the point where all 

2257
01:39:57,661 --> 01:40:01,950
the foxes had droopy ears.
Their jaws became less masculine,

2258
01:40:01,951 --> 01:40:05,010
they became smaller,
their behavior completely changed.

2259
01:40:05,011 --> 01:40:07,860
They all became like a domestic pet.
Within 10 years,

2260
01:40:07,920 --> 01:40:09,540
they'd literally became a different 
thing.

2261
01:40:09,900 --> 01:40:10,733
And so the thought is that this is what 
happened with wolves and that wolves 

2262
01:40:15,270 --> 01:40:16,103
being around campfires with people like 
primitive printer of people tens and 

2263
01:40:19,621 --> 01:40:21,660
20,000,
40,000 years ago,

2264
01:40:22,020 --> 01:40:22,853
that we slowly but surely started having
relationships with these animals where 

2265
01:40:26,371 --> 01:40:28,680
they would protect us from the other 
wolves because we would feed them.

2266
01:40:28,980 --> 01:40:31,950
And so they would become more docile and
more,

2267
01:40:32,040 --> 01:40:33,780
um,
more dependent upon us.

2268
01:40:34,020 --> 01:40:34,860
So they would,
uh,

2269
01:40:34,890 --> 01:40:36,690
they would be,
they would give in,

2270
01:40:36,870 --> 01:40:37,530
you know,
they would,

2271
01:40:37,530 --> 01:40:38,363
they would be submissive to us and so 
their ears started to flop like a dog's 

2272
01:40:42,151 --> 01:40:45,360
ear and you know,
they became less aggressive.

2273
01:40:45,360 --> 01:40:46,193
They would respond to people,
you could train them and teach them to 

2274
01:40:49,261 --> 01:40:50,094
hunt with you cause they got a reward 
out of being a part of the community of 

2275
01:40:52,351 --> 01:40:53,184
people.
And then you would raise him from the 

2276
01:40:54,161 --> 01:40:57,250
time they're puppies and they'd be even 
more inclined to go like that.

2277
01:40:57,251 --> 01:41:01,000
So someone find wolf puppies and raise 
them so they would imprint on people and

2278
01:41:01,001 --> 01:41:03,280
be even more likely to exhibit those 
behaviors.

2279
01:41:04,600 --> 01:41:09,600
Kind of heat for you hanging out with,
to become a Chihuahua gay folk?

2280
01:41:11,230 --> 01:41:15,140
Mostly some Mexicans.
Um,

2281
01:41:15,160 --> 01:41:18,400
I think,
I think chihuahuas are just,

2282
01:41:18,430 --> 01:41:21,430
it's just like thousands of years of 
that shit,

2283
01:41:21,850 --> 01:41:24,460
you know,
only selecting the smaller ones,

2284
01:41:24,461 --> 01:41:28,720
only selecting the most docile,
the most diminutive features.

2285
01:41:29,560 --> 01:41:31,080
It's a good question now.
Yeah.

2286
01:41:31,690 --> 01:41:33,550
You know,
when you get freaky with it,

2287
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:37,350
the real argument is that,
um,

2288
01:41:37,450 --> 01:41:39,610
it's very similar in fact to human 
beings.

2289
01:41:39,730 --> 01:41:40,563
Human beings are the only animals that 
vary as much in their appearance as 

2290
01:41:44,651 --> 01:41:47,190
dogs.
Like you had Shaquille o'neal and you've

2291
01:41:47,191 --> 01:41:49,990
got bridget the midget.
Those are both humans,

2292
01:41:50,350 --> 01:41:54,880
right?
How is bridget the midget or any or Brad

2293
01:41:54,880 --> 01:41:57,010
Williams,
how anybody who's got dwarfism,

2294
01:41:57,190 --> 01:42:00,310
how are they different than an English 
bulldog?

2295
01:42:02,590 --> 01:42:03,730
Right?
Yeah.

2296
01:42:03,940 --> 01:42:05,380
In a way.
I mean,

2297
01:42:05,381 --> 01:42:08,560
it's some sort of a strange change in 
the body.

2298
01:42:08,561 --> 01:42:10,180
And I don't mean this in any 
disrespectful way,

2299
01:42:10,181 --> 01:42:11,014
I'm just trying to be completely 
objective about the physical form of 

2300
01:42:13,121 --> 01:42:14,410
these people.
You know,

2301
01:42:14,411 --> 01:42:17,560
I'm not saying that people purposely 
make dwarfs,

2302
01:42:18,010 --> 01:42:21,820
but I'm saying that the physical 
characteristics that differences in,

2303
01:42:21,860 --> 01:42:23,830
uh,
an English bulldog and a wolf,

2304
01:42:24,550 --> 01:42:28,660
and that's very like the difference in 
Karl Malone and Brad Williams.

2305
01:42:28,870 --> 01:42:29,703
I mean there,
those are both humans and they both 

2306
01:42:31,241 --> 01:42:33,250
could pregnant in pregnant,
the same woman,

2307
01:42:33,640 --> 01:42:34,473
like if a woman had a baby with Karl 
Malone and then a woman had a baby with 

2308
01:42:36,641 --> 01:42:38,230
a dwarf,
like right afterwards,

2309
01:42:38,500 --> 01:42:39,333
she still mean she can get pregnant from
both of them and have a baby from both 

2310
01:42:42,251 --> 01:42:43,084
of them.
And potentially the same genetic 

2311
01:42:46,360 --> 01:42:48,480
characteristics could be passed down 
live.

2312
01:42:48,500 --> 01:42:49,780
The less likely with the dwarf.

2313
01:42:49,780 --> 01:42:50,613
But I mean,
this is incredible when you think about 

2314
01:42:51,851 --> 01:42:54,880
the variation of human beings.
We can get a little,

2315
01:42:55,110 --> 01:42:58,720
a tiny,
like a 90 pound Asian lady,

2316
01:42:59,050 --> 01:42:59,883
and then you can have Sabrina Williams,
this super athlete with giant muscles 

2317
01:43:03,491 --> 01:43:05,920
and just ridiculous explosive ability.
Well,

2318
01:43:05,921 --> 01:43:08,740
they're both female humans.
You know,

2319
01:43:08,741 --> 01:43:12,580
it's sort of like a,
like a golden lab and a rottweiler.

2320
01:43:12,670 --> 01:43:13,503
There's a both dogs,
but they're massively different 

2321
01:43:15,131 --> 01:43:16,630
characteristics.
Right?

2322
01:43:17,110 --> 01:43:17,943
And that's why like really nutty 
conspiracy people believe that human 

2323
01:43:21,131 --> 01:43:26,110
beings are created by aliens and that 
much in the same way that human beings,

2324
01:43:26,290 --> 01:43:29,740
uh,
engineered dogs and change the shape and

2325
01:43:29,741 --> 01:43:32,830
selectively bred them to the point where
they became these little chihuahuas.

2326
01:43:33,350 --> 01:43:35,080
That's what aliens did with human 
beings.

2327
01:43:35,081 --> 01:43:35,914
They came down,
they found some chimpanzees and some 

2328
01:43:37,630 --> 01:43:40,690
lower hominids and started injecting 
their DNA into him.

2329
01:43:40,691 --> 01:43:44,840
And slowly but surely created a series 
of different styles of,

2330
01:43:44,841 --> 01:43:48,820
of human being.
I've heard this before,

2331
01:43:49,470 --> 01:43:52,340
but with the vote with the,
but with the dog

2332
01:43:52,670 --> 01:43:54,440
comparison.
Yeah.

2333
01:43:56,210 --> 01:43:57,140
Yeah.
I don't know man.

2334
01:43:57,141 --> 01:43:58,550
I don't know either.
And I'm not,

2335
01:43:58,580 --> 01:43:59,690
I don't,
I don't buy the,

2336
01:43:59,700 --> 01:44:01,100
uh,
alien thing.

2337
01:44:01,101 --> 01:44:01,934
I think it's much more likely it was 
just different climates and different 

2338
01:44:05,271 --> 01:44:07,550
parts of the world.
There were isolated from each other.

2339
01:44:07,551 --> 01:44:11,380
And so I think you think he's like,
you know,

2340
01:44:13,160 --> 01:44:15,500
built bread,
adapt to your situation.

2341
01:44:15,680 --> 01:44:16,600
Yeah,
sure.

2342
01:44:17,180 --> 01:44:18,020
Yeah,
no doubt.

2343
01:44:18,350 --> 01:44:19,760
You know,
I mean,

2344
01:44:19,790 --> 01:44:20,623
there's,
there's characteristics that animals 

2345
01:44:21,621 --> 01:44:24,740
exhibit that similar animals and other,
uh,

2346
01:44:24,770 --> 01:44:28,460
other climates don't like African 
elephants for example.

2347
01:44:28,760 --> 01:44:31,670
They have enormous ears because it 
displaces heat.

2348
01:44:31,820 --> 01:44:33,980
Large surface areas displace heat 
better.

2349
01:44:34,310 --> 01:44:37,460
It's also why a lot of African men are 
very tall,

2350
01:44:38,090 --> 01:44:38,923
very tall and long because it's,
it's easier displace heat over large 

2351
01:44:42,201 --> 01:44:43,610
surface area,
right?

2352
01:44:43,820 --> 01:44:44,653
Yeah.
So like Asian elephants of different 

2353
01:44:46,461 --> 01:44:49,080
ears than African elephants do.
Right.

2354
01:44:49,350 --> 01:44:52,460
Wooly mammoths of much smaller ears 
because they were dealing with cold,

2355
01:44:52,461 --> 01:44:53,480
cold climates.

2356
01:44:54,110 --> 01:44:55,640
Whereas elephants,
you know,

2357
01:44:55,700 --> 01:44:56,533
in Africa when they're in the hot 
savannah's they have these giant ass 

2358
01:44:58,791 --> 01:45:01,040
fucking he hears.
That makes sense.

2359
01:45:01,160 --> 01:45:01,993
I mean,
speaking from my thoughts and my 

2360
01:45:05,271 --> 01:45:08,030
personal experience,
I'm definitely much better off in warmer

2361
01:45:08,031 --> 01:45:12,560
climates than I am in cold mountains.
Are you it feel it can't do it,

2362
01:45:12,561 --> 01:45:13,400
man.
Can't do it.

2363
01:45:13,490 --> 01:45:15,860
Can't do it.
Don't you get used to it though?

2364
01:45:16,700 --> 01:45:18,160
I mean,
no,

2365
01:45:18,490 --> 01:45:19,291
no,
no,

2366
01:45:19,291 --> 01:45:19,501
no,
no.

2367
01:45:19,501 --> 01:45:21,080
I just feel it in your bones.
Yeah.

2368
01:45:21,110 --> 01:45:22,420
I don't like it.
Like,

2369
01:45:22,430 --> 01:45:24,380
I don't like this.
I need to get over away from this.

2370
01:45:26,190 --> 01:45:27,820
You know,
like if it's hot,

2371
01:45:27,821 --> 01:45:28,200
I'm like,
okay,

2372
01:45:28,200 --> 01:45:32,370
guy's cool,
but not cold is like,

2373
01:45:33,240 --> 01:45:34,060
Eh,
Eh,

2374
01:45:34,060 --> 01:45:34,880
Eh,
Eh,

2375
01:45:34,880 --> 01:45:35,940
eh.
Yeah.

2376
01:45:36,330 --> 01:45:39,120
Get away.
We'll also growing up in Austin work,

2377
01:45:39,121 --> 01:45:41,220
it's hot as fuck.
Yeah,

2378
01:45:41,221 --> 01:45:42,900
definitely.
So yeah,

2379
01:45:42,930 --> 01:45:45,990
I did the New York thing couldn't deal 
with winters.

2380
01:45:46,820 --> 01:45:49,570
No Dude,
no,

2381
01:45:52,190 --> 01:45:55,060
cause I'm thinking about,
I'm thinking about all the times where I

2382
01:45:55,061 --> 01:45:55,894
busted ass and you know,
so it's like walking across the street 

2383
01:45:59,130 --> 01:45:59,963
and I stepped in and what I think is 
snow and it's like underneath is like a 

2384
01:46:04,790 --> 01:46:09,350
foot of water and you know,
I'm just walking around and you know,

2385
01:46:09,480 --> 01:46:10,313
I've got one wet foot and I'm supposed 
to be going to some fucking event or 

2386
01:46:13,071 --> 01:46:15,410
something and I go to dinner or do 
whatever.

2387
01:46:15,500 --> 01:46:17,180
I just,
I can't,

2388
01:46:17,960 --> 01:46:21,420
I can't do it.
I mean I can,

2389
01:46:21,421 --> 01:46:22,254
you know,
I don't want to sound like a pussy or 

2390
01:46:22,891 --> 01:46:23,910
anything,
but I can't do it.

2391
01:46:23,940 --> 01:46:25,440
Well you can,
but you don't want to.

2392
01:46:25,770 --> 01:46:27,360
There it is.
I don't want to,

2393
01:46:27,780 --> 01:46:30,360
I fucking don't want to.
Why should you have to?

2394
01:46:30,690 --> 01:46:32,310
I don't.
That's why I'm [inaudible] options.

2395
01:46:32,370 --> 01:46:33,203
Exactly.
Like if the whole world was New York 

2396
01:46:34,291 --> 01:46:35,220
City,
you could do it.

2397
01:46:35,970 --> 01:46:38,250
You could do it.
It's definitely better than not living.

2398
01:46:38,730 --> 01:46:39,563
No,
that's true.

2399
01:46:39,630 --> 01:46:41,160
That's very true.
I could do it,

2400
01:46:41,310 --> 01:46:43,860
but you know that there's a better spot.
Right.

2401
01:46:43,980 --> 01:46:45,740
I could adapt if I didn't know any 
better.

2402
01:46:45,750 --> 01:46:48,060
I get it down,
but here you are in the best spot.

2403
01:46:48,180 --> 01:46:49,860
Exactly.
When comes to weather,

2404
01:46:50,340 --> 01:46:52,290
nobody can fuck with La.
That's true.

2405
01:46:53,220 --> 01:46:55,710
That's very true.
That's why so many of us,

2406
01:46:56,310 --> 01:46:57,300
it's what Jamie's here.
Look at him.

2407
01:46:57,510 --> 01:46:58,560
He's like,
he's from Columbus,

2408
01:46:58,561 --> 01:47:00,150
Ohio.
Really?

2409
01:47:00,240 --> 01:47:01,170
Yeah.
Columbus,

2410
01:47:01,171 --> 01:47:03,840
Ohio gives New York City that eight out 
in the breaks.

2411
01:47:04,380 --> 01:47:07,500
As far as,
that's a pool term,

2412
01:47:07,501 --> 01:47:12,501
like it's a spot.
It's a spot of your plane.

2413
01:47:12,660 --> 01:47:13,493
10 Ball.
He gives some of the eight out in the 

2414
01:47:14,311 --> 01:47:15,990
breaks.
That means if they spot,

2415
01:47:16,080 --> 01:47:17,790
if they win,
they can win.

2416
01:47:17,791 --> 01:47:18,624
If they make the eight ball,
the nine ball or the 10 ball and they 

2417
01:47:21,331 --> 01:47:23,460
could break every touching,
that's eight out in the breaks.

2418
01:47:23,461 --> 01:47:25,980
That's a considerable,
considerable handicap.

2419
01:47:26,310 --> 01:47:27,930
Gotcha.
I would say pull a little bit,

2420
01:47:27,931 --> 01:47:29,340
but I don't.
Columbia,

2421
01:47:29,400 --> 01:47:32,280
I've been to Columbus before.
We've got this cool little venue.

2422
01:47:32,281 --> 01:47:33,840
I played that.
Columbus is great.

2423
01:47:33,900 --> 01:47:35,730
Yeah,
it's nice.

2424
01:47:35,970 --> 01:47:38,190
It's a great town.
They're cool people.

2425
01:47:38,191 --> 01:47:39,360
They're man.
It's a fun,

2426
01:47:39,390 --> 01:47:41,850
it's a fun town.
I liked Columbus a lot and haven't spent

2427
01:47:41,880 --> 01:47:44,730
a lot of times now about,
he definitely had a good time.

2428
01:47:44,820 --> 01:47:45,653
I haven't been there since.
I shot my special there in 2009 that's 

2429
01:47:47,751 --> 01:47:51,420
what Dick I am.
Where was that in one southern theater.

2430
01:47:51,840 --> 01:47:53,560
Once that the uh,
oh that's right.

2431
01:47:54,810 --> 01:47:55,950
That's right.
That's right.

2432
01:47:56,100 --> 01:47:58,830
Jamie knows my schedule better than me 
when I started working with,

2433
01:47:58,860 --> 01:48:00,150
that's ridiculous.
Jamie,

2434
01:48:00,151 --> 01:48:01,230
how do I,
how do you know this?

2435
01:48:01,231 --> 01:48:04,130
And I don't know this.
That was like 2011 or 12 right?

2436
01:48:04,140 --> 01:48:07,170
To tell them 12 yeah.
Columbus is a cool town.

2437
01:48:07,320 --> 01:48:09,780
That's like my favorite town in a,
in Ohio.

2438
01:48:11,680 --> 01:48:13,650
Ooh.

2439
01:48:13,950 --> 01:48:14,783
Where else is there in Ohio?
Like did you Cleveland Cleveland's not 

2440
01:48:16,891 --> 01:48:18,160
bad.
Cleveland.

2441
01:48:18,350 --> 01:48:20,730
Cincinnati is fun,
but Cincinnati that bullshit you,

2442
01:48:21,140 --> 01:48:23,250
he's got the Cincinnati airport in 
Kentucky.

2443
01:48:23,640 --> 01:48:25,500
I don't like that.
Why?

2444
01:48:25,590 --> 01:48:27,030
Well,
because it's insecure.

2445
01:48:27,900 --> 01:48:30,630
The Kentucky people are insecure.
They should call it the fucking Kentucky

2446
01:48:30,631 --> 01:48:31,620
airport.
Cause that's what it is.

2447
01:48:31,621 --> 01:48:32,730
God dammit.
Toledo,

2448
01:48:32,731 --> 01:48:35,310
Cincinnati assholes claim your city.
Wait,

2449
01:48:35,311 --> 01:48:36,144
but how does that even exactly.
The Cincinnati Airport is actually in 

2450
01:48:39,541 --> 01:48:40,374
Kentucky.
But to get people to fly into Kentucky 

2451
01:48:42,181 --> 01:48:43,014
is problematic because people have,
they have massive prejudice against 

2452
01:48:51,331 --> 01:48:52,170
Kentucky.
Man.

2453
01:48:52,171 --> 01:48:55,800
It just sounds like hillbillies were as 
Cincinnati is like wk Rp,

2454
01:48:56,130 --> 01:48:56,963
you know,
it's like a Loni Anderson and fucking 

2455
01:48:58,920 --> 01:49:00,500
everybody's having a good time.
Right.

2456
01:49:00,690 --> 01:49:03,450
You know,
Cincinnati sounds like a nice city,

2457
01:49:03,540 --> 01:49:04,373
right?
Well it's fucking right next door to 

2458
01:49:05,791 --> 01:49:06,624
Kentucky.
So close that you land in Kentucky and 

2459
01:49:09,121 --> 01:49:10,410
then you drive to Cincinnati.

2460
01:49:10,680 --> 01:49:13,680
So they name the fucking Cincinnati 
airport.

2461
01:49:14,700 --> 01:49:16,860
This Kentucky airport.
That's pretty good.

2462
01:49:17,010 --> 01:49:21,120
That's pretty good.
One sneaky sneaky mother fuckers.

2463
01:49:21,180 --> 01:49:24,360
They did it for people like us.
I've never going to go to Kentucky.

2464
01:49:24,670 --> 01:49:28,610
I fucking got me.
I swore I'd never come into this buts.

2465
01:49:28,640 --> 01:49:32,890
But meanwhile there's like Louisville 
where everybody goes like,

2466
01:49:32,920 --> 01:49:34,630
it doesn't make any sense.
You know,

2467
01:49:34,640 --> 01:49:35,910
with the Kentucky Derby is in 
Louisville,

2468
01:49:35,911 --> 01:49:36,720
right?
Yeah.

2469
01:49:36,720 --> 01:49:37,553
See that's like everybody goes there,
but it's one of those quaint southern 

2470
01:49:41,041 --> 01:49:42,540
destinations.
You know,

2471
01:49:43,470 --> 01:49:46,770
I liked the word quaint make too.
Yeah.

2472
01:49:46,840 --> 01:49:47,673
Ah,
I spent a little bit of time running 

2473
01:49:49,571 --> 01:49:50,660
around.
They're fun.

2474
01:49:50,680 --> 01:49:51,513
Like the,
um,

2475
01:49:52,520 --> 01:49:56,920
it's the wildest crowds and kind of like
in that area.

2476
01:49:56,921 --> 01:50:00,680
And so for me,
I think that's interesting for me.

2477
01:50:00,750 --> 01:50:02,050
I wonder why.
I wonder why that is.

2478
01:50:02,350 --> 01:50:04,210
Booze.
Uh,

2479
01:50:04,360 --> 01:50:05,680
I think,
yeah,

2480
01:50:05,890 --> 01:50:07,120
I mean,
boots happens everywhere,

2481
01:50:07,121 --> 01:50:09,490
but I feel like,
yeah,

2482
01:50:09,730 --> 01:50:11,470
people really have a good time.

2483
01:50:11,970 --> 01:50:12,803
Well,
when I started going on the road a lot 

2484
01:50:14,440 --> 01:50:17,080
in the 90s,
is when I really understood Nascar.

2485
01:50:17,890 --> 01:50:19,540
They got never got Nascar.
I'm like,

2486
01:50:19,541 --> 01:50:20,890
cool,
the fuck is watching this.

2487
01:50:21,280 --> 01:50:23,140
It's not that I didn't like car racing.
It's like,

2488
01:50:23,141 --> 01:50:25,090
who the fuck is watching these people go
around in a circle?

2489
01:50:25,390 --> 01:50:28,210
And then I would see how big it was.
I would read statistics.

2490
01:50:28,211 --> 01:50:29,380
I was like,
Bull Shit.

2491
01:50:29,410 --> 01:50:31,090
These fucking statistics are all made 
up.

2492
01:50:31,091 --> 01:50:32,980
No one's watching this.
And then,

2493
01:50:33,040 --> 01:50:35,260
uh,
I did a radio station,

2494
01:50:35,800 --> 01:50:37,810
um,
I wanna say it was in Atlanta.

2495
01:50:37,910 --> 01:50:40,270
I don't remember where it was,
but I remember,

2496
01:50:40,300 --> 01:50:41,133
uh,
it was in the south and the guy was 

2497
01:50:42,161 --> 01:50:42,370
like,
yeah,

2498
01:50:42,370 --> 01:50:44,130
did you see the race this weekend?
Man,

2499
01:50:44,140 --> 01:50:46,570
Dale Jr's really fucking putting it to 
them,

2500
01:50:46,571 --> 01:50:47,650
but me.
I was like,

2501
01:50:47,651 --> 01:50:49,810
what are you talking about?
And like Nascar,

2502
01:50:50,320 --> 01:50:52,870
Tony Stewart,
and he starts naming all these people.

2503
01:50:52,871 --> 01:50:54,220
I'm like,
I don't know who the fuck you're talking

2504
01:50:54,221 --> 01:50:57,190
about.
And he was flabbergasted that I did know

2505
01:50:57,191 --> 01:50:58,024
who these Nascar people were.
And then I didn't know who won the look 

2506
01:51:00,431 --> 01:51:02,650
and talent cus Calusa five,
five,

2507
01:51:02,651 --> 01:51:06,580
five 60 or whatever the fuck name of the
race it was.

2508
01:51:06,640 --> 01:51:08,080
He was,
he was flabbergasted.

2509
01:51:08,250 --> 01:51:09,220
And I was like,
how many people know?

2510
01:51:09,221 --> 01:51:10,054
So then we had people call in like that 
knew a lot about nascar while I was on 

2511
01:51:13,271 --> 01:51:13,841
the air.
I was like,

2512
01:51:13,841 --> 01:51:15,640
you guys know a lot about Nascar.
How many people?

2513
01:51:16,680 --> 01:51:20,350
We watch it every weekend and they'll be
like going crazy about nascar.

2514
01:51:20,351 --> 01:51:21,161
I was like,
oh,

2515
01:51:21,161 --> 01:51:23,330
okay.
So this is a geographical for go

2516
01:51:23,330 --> 01:51:25,540
cultural thing that I'm just not privy 
to.

2517
01:51:25,541 --> 01:51:27,220
I just don't understand it.
Mm.

2518
01:51:27,490 --> 01:51:28,350
Yeah.
Uh,

2519
01:51:29,410 --> 01:51:33,850
we got a little bit of taste of that and
in Texas kind of bled over a little bit,

2520
01:51:33,910 --> 01:51:36,490
but Austin has a formula one race that's
very new.

2521
01:51:36,760 --> 01:51:38,620
But how is it,
how old is that?

2522
01:51:38,650 --> 01:51:39,640
Well,
I guess,

2523
01:51:39,820 --> 01:51:41,570
I don't know.
I'm new enough.

2524
01:51:41,860 --> 01:51:44,680
Yeah,
a few years have passed I guess.

2525
01:51:44,820 --> 01:51:46,350
But yeah,
the f one,

2526
01:51:47,010 --> 01:51:48,400
uh,
that's the shit,

2527
01:51:48,401 --> 01:51:50,470
man.
That's a different kind of racing.

2528
01:51:50,471 --> 01:51:53,200
And that's my style of racing.
I love watching Formula One cars.

2529
01:51:53,201 --> 01:51:56,770
It's turns and craziness and strategy 
and you know,

2530
01:51:56,920 --> 01:52:00,040
that's,
that seems like some crazy shit.

2531
01:52:00,190 --> 01:52:01,450
Yeah.
I can get more into that,

2532
01:52:01,451 --> 01:52:05,650
but yeah,
I didn't know shit about Nascar either.

2533
01:52:06,040 --> 01:52:07,120
Yeah.
Yeah.

2534
01:52:07,260 --> 01:52:08,810
But,
you know,

2535
01:52:08,920 --> 01:52:10,770
different things.
It's definitely a cultural deal.

2536
01:52:10,771 --> 01:52:12,000
I was driving through,
you know,

2537
01:52:12,160 --> 01:52:12,993
Alabama and you know,
the south and everything and it's 

2538
01:52:17,730 --> 01:52:18,563
theirs,
you know,

2539
01:52:19,160 --> 01:52:20,980
uh,
tracks and everything,

2540
01:52:21,010 --> 01:52:23,840
you know,
for amateurs and it's,

2541
01:52:24,010 --> 01:52:25,930
it's just like a big culture,
I guess.

2542
01:52:25,931 --> 01:52:28,360
You know,
it's a big deal for those folks.

2543
01:52:28,361 --> 01:52:29,194
And they say that all came out of 
souping up their cars for moonshine 

2544
01:52:31,601 --> 01:52:33,640
runs.
I can believe it.

2545
01:52:34,530 --> 01:52:35,560
Yeah,
it makes sense.

2546
01:52:35,561 --> 01:52:37,300
Right?
I get to get in and get out of there.

2547
01:52:37,340 --> 01:52:38,670
Yeah.
Get this money,

2548
01:52:38,690 --> 01:52:39,523
get the six,
which all came from the same thing that 

2549
01:52:42,701 --> 01:52:43,750
we're dealing with,
with,

2550
01:52:43,900 --> 01:52:45,740
with psychedelics suppression.

2551
01:52:46,100 --> 01:52:46,761
Right.
I mean,

2552
01:52:46,761 --> 01:52:48,710
suppression creates diamonds.
I mean that's,

2553
01:52:48,711 --> 01:52:49,544
that's what created that kind of racing 
is people trying to figure out a way to 

2554
01:52:53,091 --> 01:52:56,600
get the fuck away from cops.
So they made cars that drove faster,

2555
01:52:56,601 --> 01:52:58,820
handled better,
and they could just get away from cops.

2556
01:52:58,821 --> 01:53:01,790
And that was the whole dukes of hazard.
That's why they had the general Lee.

2557
01:53:02,330 --> 01:53:05,870
They weren't involved in braces.
They were running away from cops.

2558
01:53:06,200 --> 01:53:07,860
They had some crazy souped up.
Fuck it.

2559
01:53:07,870 --> 01:53:08,703
That's why they couldn't have guns.
They always had bows and arrows because 

2560
01:53:10,281 --> 01:53:12,890
the cops had taken their,
their ability to have a firearm away.

2561
01:53:13,100 --> 01:53:15,530
When you're a felon in this country,
you can't own a gun anymore.

2562
01:53:15,670 --> 01:53:18,220
Right.
I understand.

2563
01:53:18,560 --> 01:53:23,560
A little bit.
This podcast turned weird,

2564
01:53:23,861 --> 01:53:24,880
right?
Yeah.

2565
01:53:25,020 --> 01:53:26,530
It was a weird one.
A little bit.

2566
01:53:26,531 --> 01:53:27,490
It was a good one though,
man.

2567
01:53:27,870 --> 01:53:28,703
Yeah.

2568
01:53:30,980 --> 01:53:33,020
So where are you performing next and now
how can,

2569
01:53:33,080 --> 01:53:35,600
how can people see your work?
Where can they find out?

2570
01:53:36,050 --> 01:53:38,600
Um,
we're performing,

2571
01:53:39,170 --> 01:53:41,510
doing something for the grammys.
Oh,

2572
01:53:41,540 --> 01:53:42,930
cool.
Um,

2573
01:53:43,130 --> 01:53:43,963
the 15th of February,
we're doing a tribute to the legendary 

2574
01:53:48,741 --> 01:53:49,574
bb king.
Beautiful Chris Stapleton and Bonnie 

2575
01:53:52,130 --> 01:53:52,963
Raitt.
I wouldn't be doing what I was doing if 

2576
01:53:54,501 --> 01:53:56,390
it weren't for guys like bb King,
you know,

2577
01:53:56,440 --> 01:53:58,090
so that's been,
it'll be cool to,

2578
01:53:58,490 --> 01:54:00,980
to be able to show him some love there.
And then we just hit the road,

2579
01:54:00,981 --> 01:54:01,940
man.
We're going everywhere.

2580

2583
01:54:07,251 --> 01:54:08,780
I see you're on twitter all the time.
There's all these little,

2584
01:54:09,140 --> 01:54:10,950

2585
01:54:11,090 --> 01:54:11,923

When are you going to be in this area 

2586
01:54:13,741 --> 01:54:16,560
where I could come see you man.
Uh,

2587
01:54:18,040 --> 01:54:20,670
what are we going to be?
Um,

2588
01:54:21,360 --> 01:54:22,193
is there anything on there?
Does it say anything there about a 

2589
01:54:24,090 --> 01:54:25,170
California?
Yeah,

2590
01:54:25,171 --> 01:54:26,670

That's uh,

2591
01:54:26,910 --> 01:54:28,130
that's about it.

2592

Okay.

2596
01:54:38,820 --> 01:54:41,220
So yeah,
we did that one and I think we're not,

2597
01:54:41,340 --> 01:54:43,770
we're not going to be around here for a 
little while.

2598
01:54:43,940 --> 01:54:44,631
